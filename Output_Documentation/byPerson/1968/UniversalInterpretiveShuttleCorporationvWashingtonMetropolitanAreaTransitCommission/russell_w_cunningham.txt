mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
russell
cunningham,
general
counsel
of
the
transit
commission
and
if
the
court
will
recall,
there
was
a
franchise
issue
involved
here
that
the
commission
has
consistently
disassociate
itself
from
through
out
since
the
beginning
of
the
trial
court.
consequently,
i
have
--
while
the
court
has
graciously
allocated
me
50
minutes
to
argue,
mr.
davis
of
d.c.
transit
will
argue
the
franchise
issue.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
and
within
my
50
minute
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
within
my
time
limits.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
fine
mr.
justice.
if
the
court
pleases,
the
washington
metropolitan
area
transit
commission
was
created
in
1960
by
an
interstate
compact
between
the
states
of
maryland
and
the
state
of
virginia
and
the
district
of
columbia
by
and
with
the
consent
and
directive
of
the
united
states
congress.
if
the
court
will
recall,
congress
has
a
dual
role
are
a
dual
hat
to
wear
in
the
district
of
columbia,
that
is
that
if
the
congress
sits
as
a
local
legislature
for
the
district
and
in
this
case
its
consent
legislation
directed
the
district
of
columbia
to
enter
into
the
compact.
on
the
other
hand,
under
its
national
purpose,
the
congress
consented
to
the
terms
of
this
interstate
compact
agreement.
the
creation
of
the
commission
marked
a
--
marked
a
historical
landmark
in
the
field
of
transportation
regulation
in
this
country.
it's
the
first
attempt
--
the
first
attempt
to
regulate
and
merge
the
national
and
state
county
and
city
interest
into
one
unified
regulatory
agency.
this
was
the
purpose
of
the
compact.
this,
the
commission
advocates
before
you
was
what
the
compact
and
the
legislatures
accomplished
when
they
enacted
the
compact.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir
i
do.
the
preamble
to
the
consent
legislation
of
the
compact
stated
that
enactment
of
this
compact
would
merge
the
national
and
state
interest
in
so
far
as
regulating
transportation
was
concerned
in
the
washington
metropolitan
area
in
this
single
compact.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
not
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
justice
fortas,
within
the
washington
and
metropolitan
area,
the
congress
took
away
the
interstate
regulation
of
transportation
from
the
interstate
com
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
oh
yes,
transportation
from
washington
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
right
sir.
the
transit
commission
is
violently
interested
in
this
case
from
both
a
legal
and
a
factual
basis.
legally,
we
feel
that
the
positions
advocated
to
you
by
the
petitioners
in
the
united
states
will
emasculate.
emasculate
a
very
basis
upon
which
the
commission
can
perform
in
the
functions
and
duties
conferred
upon
it
by
the
congress
and
the
state
legislatures.
from
a
factual
standpoint,
the
commission
is
interested
because
we're
very
greatly
disturbed
as
to
what
will
happen
when
another
large
transit
system
is
placed
not
only
over
on
top
of
the
existing
transportation
system
but
placed
upon
us
within
the
very
heart
of
the
washington
metropolitan
area.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
vehicles
operated
by
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
the
district
of
columbia
itself,
no
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
no
sir,
those
--
any
passenger
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
that's
right
sir.
we
feel
that
any
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
and
therefore
is
exempt.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
when
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
no
sir,
and
it
has
so
operated
this
vehicles
it
is
today
operating
vehicles
and
we
have
made
no
attempt
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
we
feel
that
it
is
not
--
it
is
exempted
under
that
statutory
exemption.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir
and
i
submit
to
you
mr.
justice
fortas
that
you
would
effectively
dispose
off
any
type
of
regulation
of
transportation
in
metropolitan
area
for
you
would
thereby
completely
emasculate
the
jurisdiction
of
a
commission
to
control
regulation
in
this
area.
every
city,
every
town,
every
county,
even
the
state
jurisdictions
themselves
would
be
free
at
the
stroke
of
a
pen
by
entering
into
a
contract
with
a
private
carrier
to
set
up
and
operate
their
own
mass
transit
system.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
right
sir
and
that's
why
the
commission
advocates
that
the
construction
given
to
that
clause
should
be
strictly
construed
as
i
understand
this
court
has
ruled
previously.
all
tran
--
all
--
any
exempt
--
exemption
to
a
broad
remedial
statute
like
the
compact
that
the
exemptions
are
strictly
construed
and
that's
the
position
we
have
advocate
to
this
court
that
that
--
that
proviso
should
be
strictly
construed,
not
only
for
the
mischief
that
it
would
do
in
the
future
and
do
today
but
because
it
would
destroy
the
whole
historical
scheme
of
regulation.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
no
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
there
would
not
because
the
congress
has
not
imposed
the
scheme
of
regulation,
i.e.
it
has
not
pass
an
interstate
compact
in
yellowstone
park
as
it
has
here
in
washington.
i
submit
to
you
sir
that
the
congress
when
it
looked
at
establishing
the
compact
here
in
this
area,
said,
where
you
look
at
the
washington
metropolitan
area
is
a
single
unified
city
and
this
includes
park
areas,
it
has
to,
its
sitting
right
here
in
the
very
heart,
the
very
core
of
our
city.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
no
such
scheme
existing
in
yellowstone
national
park,
that
park
sits
out
by
itself,
its
not
part
of
a
transit
regulatory
system,
its
not
the
heart
and
core
of
a
city
and
congress
has
under
the
icc
law
specifically
exempted
transportation
performed
pursuant
to
contract
by
the
secretary
in
national
parks
but
that
proviso
was
not
enacted,
was
not
carried
and
reenacted
sir
in
the
compact.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
assuming
he
has
statutory
authority
to
do
so,
that
government
agency
has
statutory
to
do
so
under
the
terms
of
the
compact
it
would
be
permissible.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
because
i
think
in
this
case
it
was
to
discourage
--
number
one
was
discourage
active
engagement
by
the
governmental
units
by
contract
or
otherwise
in
engaging
in
transportation.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
it
would
discourage
the
governmental
units
from
getting
into
the
contract
--
into
the
transportation
business.
first
of
all,
if
a
government
unit
decides,
i
--
we
want
to
get
into
that,
into
a
particular
phase
of
transportation.
if
it
has
to
go
to
the
legislature
and
get
the
statutory
authority
to
do
so,
if
it
has
to
go
in
to
have
the
appropriations
enacted
forth,
this
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
saying,
well,
lets
just
go
get
joe
jones
and
sign
a
contract
with
mr.
jones
and
let
him
operate
this
service
and
pay
us
a
profit.
there's
a
much
more
involved
in
operating
a
concession
or
a
contractual
service
than
there
is.
and
moreover,
this
is
directly
contrary
to
the
--
to
the
whole
concept
of
regulation
that
existed
in
this
country
since
1887
and
that
is
if
the
government
itself
is
not
subject
to
its
own
laws
and
if
it
wants
to
operate
its
own
service,
it
may
do
so.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
wishes
to
--
to
have
a
service
performed
by
a
private
carrier,
a
private
person,
that
person
is
subject
to
the
regulatory
scheme
of
that
governmental
agency,
whether
it
be
the
national
government,
vis-a-vis
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
tate
government
or
in
this
case
the
interstate
compact.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
the
same
broad
regulatory
jurisdictions
that
we
have
over
all
carriers.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
character
of
service,
rates,
schedule
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
oh!
no
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
oh!
no
mr.
chief
justice,
no
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
no,
we
would
--
they
would
not
be
divested.
today,
carriers
--
every
single
carrier
we
operate
changes
schedules.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
schedules,
they
change
the
routes,
they
change
their
fares,
they
change
all
aspects.
now,
that
is
subject
to
the
overall
scheme
of
regulation
but
there
is
that
freedom
of
movement
within
the
regulatory
aspect.
the
transit
commission
is
a
regulatory
agency
not
a
management,
not
a
management
agency
and
we
try
to
fit
what
is
going
on
within
the
broad
regulatory
concept
to
provide
a
good
transit
system
throughout
this
whole
metropolitan
area.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
no
sir.
the
fare
that
was
--
would
be
determined
by
the
secretary
of
interior
in
universal
pursuant
to
their
contract
and
universal
being
the
--
if
they
were
the
recipient
of
the
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
would
then
follow
with
the
commission
stating
that
these
are
the
fares
to
be
charged
and
that
would
be
subject
to
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
and
that
would
be
subject
to
approval.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
oh!
yes,
i
would
think
that
under
the
law,
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
and
this
is
done
today
within
--for
example,
the
last
three
weeks
if
i
may
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
it
is.
it
is
subject
to
commission's
approval.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
it
would
be
reviewed,
yes.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
that's
true
mr.
justice
brennan
and
i
would
think
the
commission
would
give
the
greatest
of
weight
--
i
would
think
whenever
a
concessionaire
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
came
before
the
commission
stating
that
this
is
the
type
of
service
we'd
like
to
run
or
this
is
the
type
of
fare
that
we
propose
to
charge
and
that
would
be
accorded
almost
in
automatic
presumption
of
being
legitimate
because
the
commission
would
recognize
the
special
interest
that
is
involved
in
this
area.
if
you
recall,
not
all
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
are
all
embrace
here.
many
--
they
are
issued
involving
only
a
very
limited
scope
and
this
i
presume
would
be
the
case
in
so
far
as
the
secretary's
concessionaire
that
he
would
--
cannot
before
and
then
lend
certificate
to
serve
all
of
the
metropolitan
area
but
on
a
limited
basis.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
script
is
a
bad
word
to
use
recently
with
need
mr.
justice.
we've
been
on
this
script
system
involved
in
the
best
robberies
here
in
town.
yes
sir,
i
would
assume
all
aspect
of
this
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
all
aspect
of
such
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
i
assume
this
was
what
they
were
talking
about
and
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
thought
you
said
scrip,
s-c-r-i-p
and
you're
talking
to
the
scrip.
no
sir,
the
commission
would
have
very
little
interest
in
what
although
they
probably
commend
to
standard
to
service.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
we
would
--
i
don't
know,
i
can't
conceive
with
the
commission
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
having
any
jurisdiction
over
the
script
itself,
no.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
oh,
yes
sir,
i
think
a
very
legitimate
interest
just
as
the
carriers
today,
he
perform
the
selected
sightseeing
tours;
have
scripts
for
their
drivers
to
follow.
now,
we
have
no
concern
with
that
in
so
far
unless
there
would
be
some
vulgarity
or
something
like
that
of
this
nature
involved
but
i'm
sure
in
many
instance
we
have
no
idea
what
the
script
itself
even
affords
to
be,
and
some
of
them
are
even
on
tapes
in
some
of
the
carriers
in
multilingual
language.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
according
to
the
district
court
decision,
does
it
not
up
to
either
the
transit
commission
or
the
carriers
but
that
any
such
service
would
be
at
the
sufferance
of
the
secretary
of
interior
and
presumably
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
he
can
draw
his
curtain
around
the
mall
and
say
nobody
is
coming
in
here.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
no
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
secretary
has
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
never
been
known
as
a
regulator
of
transportation.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
i
don't
call
--
recall
mr.
justice
fortas
from
my
reading
of
the
contract
whether
there
is
an
exclusive
--
exclusivity
connected
with
it.
i
presume
there
that
there
is
because
otherwise
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
there's
other
service
on
the
mall
now.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
as
of
this
moment,
no
because
universal
is
not
running
the
service
but
i
would
assume
that
once
universal
begins
running,
it
would
be
in
the
secretary's
interest
to
discourage
other
service
because
he's
going
to
get
a
fee
for
it.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
that's
the
substance
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
well,
but
assume
that
universal
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
no
sir.
our
position
is
that
there
are
dual
--
there
exist
dual
jurisdiction
in
the
park
plans
and
that
anyone
wishing
to
operate
a
transportation
service
there
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
must
have
authorization
from
the
secretary
of
interior
to
operate
his
vehicles
on
the
park
property
and
he
must
also
have
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
from
the
commission.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
i
would
think
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
the
other
way
around,
yes
sir.
i
think
this
is
strictly
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
a
situation
where
there
has
to
be
a
great
deal
of
committee
between
the
two
--
the
two
bodies.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
the
commission.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
sir.
solely
because
we
feel
that
under
this
scheme
of
regulation
for
this
metropolitan
area
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
the
commission
has
to
fit
every
form
of
transportation
into
the
overall
program.
now,
i
say
this
not
lightly
because
right
now,
i'm
sure
most
of
your
honors
are
aware
of
the
fact
that
we
have
literally
hundreds
of
buses
under
rush
hour
on
constitution
avenue,
hundreds
of
them
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
wish
some
of
those
buses
could
make
10
miles
an
hour
under
rush
hour
but
to
set
another
large
mass
transit
system
and
this
is
what's
--
what
we're
talking
about.
we're
not
talking
about
running
one
or
two
or
three
articulated
vehicles,
we're
talking
about
the
movements
of
thousands
of
people
a
day
on
these
vehicles.
now,
suppose
that
the
traffic
conditions
are
such
that
we
cannot
--
that
there
has
to
be
since
inner
scheduling
of
this
service
that
there
has
to
be
some
accommodation
made.
now,
if
the
commission
does
not
have
jurisdiction
overall,
the
secretary
says
he's
going
to
run
this
service
and
the
bus
carrier
say
we're
going
to
run
this
service
and
we're
in
a
irreconcilable
position
--
who
is
going
to
make
the
distinction?
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
sir,
they
can't
run
anywhere
else.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
every
single
street
that
they've
talked
about
in
the
--
this
initial
service
and
i
remind
you
sir
that
its
initial
service
operates
over
a
public
street
in
the
district
of
columbia.
i
don't
care
who
owns
it,
whether
it's
operated
--
whether
it's
owned
by
the
park
service
and
maintained
and
policed
by
the
park
service
or
whether
its
own,
maintained
and
policed
by
the
district
of
columbia,
it's
a
public
street
and
everybody
is
out
using
it.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir
and
that
the
service
that's
operated
today,
down
on
the
mall
today
is
on
a
public
road.
every
single
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
it
is
my
understanding
that
it
is
running
on
constitution
avenue
and
it
will
run.
how
else
can
it
run,
it
has
to
turn
around
down
at
the
capital
and
run
back
up
mr.
justice
white
and
they're
also
talking
about
running
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir,
very
much
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
this
--
the
service
that's
being
operated
today
i
think
without
question
is
in
the
secretary's
mind,
the
very
minimum
of
service
that
would
be
provided.
unquestionably,
he'll
want
to
extend
the
service
to
the
union
station
visitor
center.
unquestionably,
he'll
want
to
render
service
up
around
the
capital.
unquestionably,
he'll
want
to
run
it
up
around
to
the
white
house.
unquestionably,
he's
going
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
because
any
decision
you
make
here
mr.
justice
white
is
going
to
be
just
as
applicable
tomorrow
when
the
service
is
extended
another
block
or
another
two
blocks
or
across
the
river
to
arlington
cemetery
or
down
to
mount
vernon.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir
--
and
that's
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
the
one
the
commission
is
most
worried
about.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
well,
mr.
justice
white,
if
you
decide
this
question
on
a
basis
that
the
commission
--
the
secretary's
legislative
enactment
says
he
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
we
will
not
consider
any
other
legislative
enactment,
then
if
you
stop
there
that
would
be
one
thing
but
i
think
you've
got
to
take
this
one
step
further
and
say
--
is
this
a
--
is
this
service
to
be
provided
transportation?
now,
i
don't
think
there's
any
other
conclusion
that
you
can
come
--
can
come
to
other
than
that
it
is
transportation,
this
is
what's
going
on
down
--
going
to
be
going
on
throughout
the
mall
area
is
transporting
people.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
alright.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
that's
what
the
united
states
stated
here
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
now,
that
act
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
well,
i
don't
believe
it's
true.
that
act
states
as
follows.
the
reg
--
the
applicability
of
the
rules
and
regulations
prescribed
and
applicable
to
the
--
to
the
secretary
is
hereby
extended
to
cover
the
sidewalks
--
the
sidewalks
around
the
public
grounds
and
the
carriage
ways
of
such
streets
as
lie
between
and
separate
said
public
grounds
so
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
is
hereby
extended
to
cover
the
sidewalks
around
the
public
grounds
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
and
the
carriage
ways
of
such
streets
as
lie
between
and
separate
the
said
public
grounds.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
that
would
exclude
it
--
that
would
include
it
to
the
extent
for
example
that
the
streets
are
involved
now
perhaps
second
street
and
third
street
and
ninth
street
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
perhaps
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
but
now,
the
thing
the
commission
is
worried
about
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
the
rule
you
lay
down
here
will
also
have
to
embrace
transportation
to
ford
theater
to
the
whitehouse
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
to
the
visitor's
center
and
there
is
--
if
you
start
talking
about
connecting
streets
between
the
mall
and
the
visitor's
center
and
we've
got
it
as
space
of
four
blocks,
five
blocks
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
of
all
district
streets.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
i
really
don't
know
mr.
justice
warren
--
mr.
chief
justice
because
they
talk
about
lie
as
such
street
as
lie
between
and
separate
public
grounds.
now,
they're
not
referring
to
the
mall
here.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
and
there
are
--
and
there
are
perhaps
seven
or
eight
streets
which
separates
the
mall
from
the
visitor
center.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
but
of
course,
some
of
these
operation
is
out
on
--
on
the
d.c.
streets
and
not
just
going
across.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
i'm
--
if
you'll
defer
just
a
moment
sir,
i
want
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
to
get
to
my
map
down
here.
alright,
in
the
--
in
the
appendix
on
page
16
and
17
appears
a
map
and
it
shows
the
service
that
will
be
run
by
universal.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
on
page
16
and
17
of
the
appendix.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
if
you
will
note
that
the
lines
running
down
--
the
arrows
going
down
constitution
avenue
and
quite
obviously
these
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir,
exhibit
b.
the
service
contemplated
will
run
down
constitution
avenue
from
the
intersection
of
bacon
drive
and
constitution
avenue
to
fifteenth
street.
now,
that
street,
constitution
avenue
does
not
appear
to
be
a
street,
a
sidewalk
or
a
carriage
way
is
lie
between
and
separate
the
mall.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir
and
its
--
if
i
also
remind
your
honor
that
we
have
now
under
rush
hour
several
hundred
buses
going
down
that
street,
constitution
avenue.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
i
really
don't
know
what
it's
going
to
do
to
us
unless
this
transportation
is
subject
to
our
jurisdiction
because
one
of
the
problems
we
have
and
is
a
great
one
today
is
accommodation
of
vehicles
on
these
streets.
mr.
chief
justice,
you
recall
that
in
the
--
one
of
the
statutory
requirements
placed
upon
this
commission
which
is
never
been
placed
upon
a
transportation
agency
--
regulation
agency
before
is
the
alleviation
of
traffic
congestion
on
the
streets
of
the
district
through
the
regulation
of
the
mass
transit
system
and
this
is
going
and
it
could
cause
us
considerable
problem
but
the
biggest
problem
would
come
about
is
if
this
service
is
not
melted
in
--
in
an
orderly
fashion
with
the
other
service.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
no
sir.
the
service
now
being
--
i
say
no
sir,
i
--
you
understand
my
answer
is
limited,
my
knowledge
is
limited.
it's
best
to
my
understanding
that
a
service
is
not
operating
up
around
the
whitehouse
or
around
the
ellipse
today.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
it
is.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
i
believe
its
--
its
classified
as
one
of
the
streets
in
which
there
is
dual
jurisdiction
at
both
the
park
service
and
the
district
attend
to
at
least
that
they
maintain
them.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
mr.
chief
justice,
my
recollection
of
the
record
is
that
this
portion
of
constitution
avenue,
it's
shown
on
exhibit
b
is
owned
and
maintained
by
the
district
of
columbia
and
not
the
secretary
of
interior.
i
could
be
wrong,
it
could
be
another
section
but
that
was
--
that
was
my
understanding.
we
feel
that
--
that
the
language
of
section
1
that
this
case
really
must
turn
on
the
language
of
section
1
(a)
and
that
language
clearly
defines
the
scope
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction
and
that
is
that
it
is
transportation
and
embraces
the
person
who
engages
in
that
transportation.
now,
transportation
is
not
defined
in
the
compact
but
it
is
not
given
a
restricted
meaning
other
than
its
general
term
and
we
believe
that
the
service
that
will
be
engaged
in
by
universal
will
be
or
any
concessionaire
that
its
secretaries
will
be
transportation.
the
senate
report
to
this
legislation
stated
that
title
2
provides
the
regulatory
law
which
is
to
be
administered.
section
1
defines
the
scope
of
the
compact
and
the
transportation
covered.
now,
section
1
does
not
say
mass
transit
or
any
other
kind
of
specialized
service
but
is
--
uses
the
term
transportation
which
we
feel
embraces
all
types
of
transportation
services.
that
language
is
clear
non-unambiguous,
nevertheless,
it
is
urged
and
decided
below
in
the
court
--
in
the
district
court
that
the
term
transportation
does
not
really
mean
transportation,
it
means
mass
transit.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
quite
obviously
reversed
that
decision
and
felt
the
transportation
must
be
construed
to
mean
simply
all
forms
of
movement
by
motor
vehicle
of
people.
to
reach
the
determination
that
its
mass
transit
rather
than
transportation
per
se,
one
must
ignore,
number
one,
the
plain
language
of
the
law.
he
must
ignore
the
legislative
history.
he
must
ignore
the
historical
concept
of
regulation
and
he
must
ignore
previous
decisions
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
in
each
case,
that
court
said
that
this
commission's
jurisdiction
is
--
should
be
given
the
broadest
construction
possible
and
embrace
all
forms
of
transportation.
it
also
conforms
to
the
major
principles
of
law
that
remedial
statutes
of
the
like
the
compact
shall
be
broadly
construed
in
all
exemptions
narrowly
construed.
the
commission
feels
it
cannot
be
argued
or
denied
that
the
function
under
universal's
contract
is
that
universal
is
to
perform
a
movement
of
people
in
motor
vehicles.
this
service
is
going
to
be
operated
on
streets.
it's
going
to
be
operated
on
public
streets
regardless
of
who
is
the
owner
and
maintainer
of
that
street.
it
will
be
in
a
vehicle
that
will
be
owned
by
a
private
carrier.
it
will
be
driven
by
employees
of
that
private
carrier
and
as
the
contract
itself
specifies,
those
employee
shall
be
dressed
so
as
to
be
distinctly
known
as
universal
employees,
not
park
service
employees
but
universal
employees.
now,
what
happens
when
a
man
gets
on
at
the
end
of
the
--
of
the
mall
to
take
a
tour,
he's
not
only
getting
in
universal's
vehicles
driven
by
universal's
drivers,
he
pays
universal
a
fee
and
that
money
then
becomes
universal's.
clearly,
the
act
of
any
carrier,
any
common
carrier
in
this
country,
this
is
the
role
that
it
performs
and
that's
the
role
that
a
--
that
a
utility
carrier
provides
whether
that
act
is
done
for
the
general
public
which
is
this
case
here.
this
is
not
a
service
for
the
united
states.
it's
a
service
for
the
public.
now,
contrast
that
if
you
will
that
the
usac
transport
case
in
which
the
transportation
being
provided
there
was
to
the
federal
government
itself.
here,
the
service
is
not
being
provided
to
the
government,
it's
being
provided
to
the
millions
of
people
who
will
come
down
under
the
mall.
the
federal
government
is
giving
up
or
allowing
a
carrier
to
come
on
its
property
and
operate
and
perform
certain
services
that
it
request
and
would
like
to
see
perform
for
the
public
and
in
turn
receives
a
percentage
fee
of
the
fares
collected
through
the
fare
box
of
that
contract
carrier.
now,
today,
we
have
numerous
carriers
operating
under
contract
with
various
governmental
agencies,
department
of
state,
department
of
defense,
the
army,
the
navy
and
each
case,
those
carriers
have
authorization
from
the
commission.
now,
that
service
is
regulated
in
so
far
as
the
standard
of
service
is
concerned
and
in
so
far
as
fares
are
concerned.
we
have
not
had
one
single
conflict
with
those
governmental
agencies
in
so
far
as
what
service
they
want
and
what
service
is
directed
and
authorized
by
the
commission.
not
one
single
bit
of
difference
and
we
submit
your
honors
that
this
would
be
the
case
under
this
situation.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
feel
in
closing
i
would
like
to
stress
and
accentuate
two
points
as
to
which
we
feel
very
strongly
about.
first,
we
feel
that
there
must
be
an
accommodation
made
between
the
laws
of
the
secretary
of
interior
and
the
compact
itself.
otherwise,
we
fear
deeply
that
there
will
be
irreconcilable
conflicts
on
the
streets
of
washington
served
by
carriers
subject
to
our
jurisdiction
and
those
operating
pursuant
to
the
franchise
of
the
secretary.
we
feel
that
someone
must
be
in
position
to
resolve
any
irreconcilable
conflicts.
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
to
coordinate
and
improve
in
every
fashion
all
of
this
transportation
service.
this
may
be
accomplished
not
by
accepting
the
argument
of
the
petitioners
that
the
secretary's
laws
are
mutually
exclusive
and
cannot
be
app
--
in
the
compact
cannot
be
applied.
we
feel
there
isn't
only
that
there
will
be
no
mischief,
no
harm
done
if
the
court
accepts
the
view
of
the
commission
that
there
is
--
that
the
compact
is
applicable
that
dual
jurisdiction
does
exist
that
on
the
one
hand,
the
secretary
of
interior
has
those
ministerial
duties
and
the
right
to
organize
and
supervise
his
transit
service
on
the
mall
or
between
any
part
properties.
on
the
other
hand,
we
feel
that
the
congress
very
clearly
did
not
intend
that
any
public
transportation
service
would
be
excluded
from
the
regulation
by
the
transit
commission.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
that
is
true
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
quite
possibly,
quite
possibly
and
i
think
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
the
difference
is
mr.
chief
justice
that
i
feel
that
congress
when
it
enacted
the
exemption
by
the
federal
government
or
the
signatories
intended
to
leave
a
small
area
open
whereby
the
government
could
operates
its
own
service
and
follow
the
traditional
regulatory
scheme
--
statutory
regulatory
scheme
that
where
the
government
itself
provides
a
service
that
that
service
is
not
in
turn
regulated
by
another
governmental
agents
that
on
the
other
hand
where
it
does
require
a
private
carrier
to
provide
that
same
service,
then
that
service
must
be
regulated
and
that
is
the
holding
in
the
u.s.a.c.
transport
case.
that
has
been
the
holding
if
every
supreme
court
cases,
state
court
decision
that
i
know
of
sir.
this
is
the
primary
distinction
i
think
clearly
that
this
was
scheme
that
existed
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
compact
and
that
those
--
what
congress
in
the
state
legislatures
intended
to
be
accomplished
in
the
future.
now
we
don't
feel
that
there
will
be
any
problem
arising
under
this
dual
jurisdiction.
the
regulatory
agency
in
most
instances
accepts
the
managerial
decisions
of
the
owners
of
transit
companies
and
in
this
case,
the
secretary
is
free
to
contract
with
this
concessionaire
and
supervise
it
day
and
night.
we
welcome
a
service
of
this
kind
that
we
feel
that
there
must
be
an
accommodation
between
the
secretary
service
and
melding
of
that
service
in
the
supervision
of
that
service
under
the
regulatory
concept
by
the
commission.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
i
think
mr.
justice
white
there
is
a
calming
wind
of
authority
here.
on
the
one
hand,
we
have
the
secretary
saying,
“i
will
allow
or
i
will
provide
certain
service
on
the
mall
area
and
i
will
exclude
what
service
that
i
feel
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
to
be
on
there.”
because
this
congress
said
“i
shall
administer
this
property.”
on
the
other
hand,
the
congress
has
also
said
“we
want
the
transit
commission
to
regulate
a
unified
transit
system
of
all
kinds
throughout
this
metropolitan
area.”
congress
i
feel
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir,
i
think
it
does.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
i'm
saying
in
this
instance
wherever
a
governmental
agency
comes
in
and
i
would
think
in
this
case
it
would
--
being
the
secretary
of
interior,
we
carry
even
more
of
preponderance
of
evidence
in
light
that
if
the
secretary
came
to
the
commission
and
said
--
i'm
sorry,
if
a
concessionaire
came
to
the
commission
and
said,
“we
wish
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity,”
and
here
is
a
contract
from
the
secretary
of
the
interior
saying
that
we
are
the
only
carrier
that
he
is
going
to
permit
to
provide
this
service
on
the
mall.
i
would
think
it's
almost
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
--
maybe
rebuttable,
but
i'm
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
that's
correctly
right
mr.
justice
brennan
and
we
feel
this
is
what
congress
intended
when
they
set
up
the
commission
and
said
there
will
be
no
longer
political
subdivisions
of
any
kind
chopping
up
the
regulatory
agency
in
the
metropolitan
area.
we
want
one
agency
to
regulate
transportation.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
there
only
be
one
regulatory
agency,
yes
sir.
that
on
the
other
hand,
the
secretary's
powers
to
maintain
and
supervise
and
administer
the
mall
still
remains
open
to
him.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
sir.
and
we
feel
under
the
law
this
was
statutory
scheme
that
the
congress
and
the
legislatures
intended
that
not
only
the
secretary
of
the
interior
would
be
subject
to
this
control
but
any
municipality,
any
county,
any
other
federal
government
agency
and
in
fact
we
have
this
going
on
today
where
we
have
contract
services
between
various
carriers
and
various
federal
agencies.
i
went
in
to
that
aspect
yesterday.
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
court
that
concludes
my
argument
this
morning,
mr.
davis
has
remainder
of
the
time
to
argue
the
franchise
issue
and
may
i
thank
you
gentleman.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
russell
cunningham,
general
counsel
of
the
transit
commission
and
if
the
court
will
recall,
there
was
a
franchise
issue
involved
here
that
the
commission
has
consistently
disassociate
itself
from
through
out
since
the
beginning
of
the
trial
court.
consequently,
i
have
--
while
the
court
has
graciously
allocated
me
50
minutes
to
argue,
mr.
davis
of
d.c.
transit
will
argue
the
franchise
issue.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
and
within
my
50
minute
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
within
my
time
limits.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
fine
mr.
justice.
if
the
court
pleases,
the
washington
metropolitan
area
transit
commission
was
created
in
1960
by
an
interstate
compact
between
the
states
of
maryland
and
the
state
of
virginia
and
the
district
of
columbia
by
and
with
the
consent
and
directive
of
the
united
states
congress.
if
the
court
will
recall,
congress
has
a
dual
role
are
a
dual
hat
to
wear
in
the
district
of
columbia,
that
is
that
if
the
congress
sits
as
a
local
legislature
for
the
district
and
in
this
case
its
consent
legislation
directed
the
district
of
columbia
to
enter
into
the
compact.
on
the
other
hand,
under
its
national
purpose,
the
congress
consented
to
the
terms
of
this
interstate
compact
agreement.
the
creation
of
the
commission
marked
a
--
marked
a
historical
landmark
in
the
field
of
transportation
regulation
in
this
country.
it's
the
first
attempt
--
the
first
attempt
to
regulate
and
merge
the
national
and
state
county
and
city
interest
into
one
unified
regulatory
agency.
this
was
the
purpose
of
the
compact.
this,
the
commission
advocates
before
you
was
what
the
compact
and
the
legislatures
accomplished
when
they
enacted
the
compact.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir
i
do.
the
preamble
to
the
consent
legislation
of
the
compact
stated
that
enactment
of
this
compact
would
merge
the
national
and
state
interest
in
so
far
as
regulating
transportation
was
concerned
in
the
washington
metropolitan
area
in
this
single
compact.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
not
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
justice
fortas,
within
the
washington
and
metropolitan
area,
the
congress
took
away
the
interstate
regulation
of
transportation
from
the
interstate
com
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
oh
yes,
transportation
from
washington
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
right
sir.
the
transit
commission
is
violently
interested
in
this
case
from
both
a
legal
and
a
factual
basis.
legally,
we
feel
that
the
positions
advocated
to
you
by
the
petitioners
in
the
united
states
will
emasculate.
emasculate
a
very
basis
upon
which
the
commission
can
perform
in
the
functions
and
duties
conferred
upon
it
by
the
congress
and
the
state
legislatures.
from
a
factual
standpoint,
the
commission
is
interested
because
we're
very
greatly
disturbed
as
to
what
will
happen
when
another
large
transit
system
is
placed
not
only
over
on
top
of
the
existing
transportation
system
but
placed
upon
us
within
the
very
heart
of
the
washington
metropolitan
area.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
vehicles
operated
by
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
the
district
of
columbia
itself,
no
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
no
sir,
those
--
any
passenger
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
that's
right
sir.
we
feel
that
any
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
and
therefore
is
exempt.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
when
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
no
sir,
and
it
has
so
operated
this
vehicles
it
is
today
operating
vehicles
and
we
have
made
no
attempt
to
exercise
jurisdiction.
we
feel
that
it
is
not
--
it
is
exempted
under
that
statutory
exemption.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir
and
i
submit
to
you
mr.
justice
fortas
that
you
would
effectively
dispose
off
any
type
of
regulation
of
transportation
in
metropolitan
area
for
you
would
thereby
completely
emasculate
the
jurisdiction
of
a
commission
to
control
regulation
in
this
area.
every
city,
every
town,
every
county,
even
the
state
jurisdictions
themselves
would
be
free
at
the
stroke
of
a
pen
by
entering
into
a
contract
with
a
private
carrier
to
set
up
and
operate
their
own
mass
transit
system.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
right
sir
and
that's
why
the
commission
advocates
that
the
construction
given
to
that
clause
should
be
strictly
construed
as
i
understand
this
court
has
ruled
previously.
all
tran
--
all
--
any
exempt
--
exemption
to
a
broad
remedial
statute
like
the
compact
that
the
exemptions
are
strictly
construed
and
that's
the
position
we
have
advocate
to
this
court
that
that
--
that
proviso
should
be
strictly
construed,
not
only
for
the
mischief
that
it
would
do
in
the
future
and
do
today
but
because
it
would
destroy
the
whole
historical
scheme
of
regulation.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
no
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
warren,
there
would
not
because
the
congress
has
not
imposed
the
scheme
of
regulation,
i.e.
it
has
not
pass
an
interstate
compact
in
yellowstone
park
as
it
has
here
in
washington.
i
submit
to
you
sir
that
the
congress
when
it
looked
at
establishing
the
compact
here
in
this
area,
said,
where
you
look
at
the
washington
metropolitan
area
is
a
single
unified
city
and
this
includes
park
areas,
it
has
to,
its
sitting
right
here
in
the
very
heart,
the
very
core
of
our
city.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
no
such
scheme
existing
in
yellowstone
national
park,
that
park
sits
out
by
itself,
its
not
part
of
a
transit
regulatory
system,
its
not
the
heart
and
core
of
a
city
and
congress
has
under
the
icc
law
specifically
exempted
transportation
performed
pursuant
to
contract
by
the
secretary
in
national
parks
but
that
proviso
was
not
enacted,
was
not
carried
and
reenacted
sir
in
the
compact.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
assuming
he
has
statutory
authority
to
do
so,
that
government
agency
has
statutory
to
do
so
under
the
terms
of
the
compact
it
would
be
permissible.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
because
i
think
in
this
case
it
was
to
discourage
--
number
one
was
discourage
active
engagement
by
the
governmental
units
by
contract
or
otherwise
in
engaging
in
transportation.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
it
would
discourage
the
governmental
units
from
getting
into
the
contract
--
into
the
transportation
business.
first
of
all,
if
a
government
unit
decides,
i
--
we
want
to
get
into
that,
into
a
particular
phase
of
transportation.
if
it
has
to
go
to
the
legislature
and
get
the
statutory
authority
to
do
so,
if
it
has
to
go
in
to
have
the
appropriations
enacted
forth,
this
is
quite
a
different
thing
from
saying,
well,
lets
just
go
get
joe
jones
and
sign
a
contract
with
mr.
jones
and
let
him
operate
this
service
and
pay
us
a
profit.
there's
a
much
more
involved
in
operating
a
concession
or
a
contractual
service
than
there
is.
and
moreover,
this
is
directly
contrary
to
the
--
to
the
whole
concept
of
regulation
that
existed
in
this
country
since
1887
and
that
is
if
the
government
itself
is
not
subject
to
its
own
laws
and
if
it
wants
to
operate
its
own
service,
it
may
do
so.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
wishes
to
--
to
have
a
service
performed
by
a
private
carrier,
a
private
person,
that
person
is
subject
to
the
regulatory
scheme
of
that
governmental
agency,
whether
it
be
the
national
government,
vis-a-vis
the
interstate
commerce
commission
or
tate
government
or
in
this
case
the
interstate
compact.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
the
same
broad
regulatory
jurisdictions
that
we
have
over
all
carriers.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
character
of
service,
rates,
schedule
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
oh!
no
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
oh!
no
mr.
chief
justice,
no
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
no,
we
would
--
they
would
not
be
divested.
today,
carriers
--
every
single
carrier
we
operate
changes
schedules.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
schedules,
they
change
the
routes,
they
change
their
fares,
they
change
all
aspects.
now,
that
is
subject
to
the
overall
scheme
of
regulation
but
there
is
that
freedom
of
movement
within
the
regulatory
aspect.
the
transit
commission
is
a
regulatory
agency
not
a
management,
not
a
management
agency
and
we
try
to
fit
what
is
going
on
within
the
broad
regulatory
concept
to
provide
a
good
transit
system
throughout
this
whole
metropolitan
area.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
no
sir.
the
fare
that
was
--
would
be
determined
by
the
secretary
of
interior
in
universal
pursuant
to
their
contract
and
universal
being
the
--
if
they
were
the
recipient
of
the
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
would
then
follow
with
the
commission
stating
that
these
are
the
fares
to
be
charged
and
that
would
be
subject
to
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
and
that
would
be
subject
to
approval.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
oh!
yes,
i
would
think
that
under
the
law,
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
and
this
is
done
today
within
--for
example,
the
last
three
weeks
if
i
may
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
it
is.
it
is
subject
to
commission's
approval.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
it
would
be
reviewed,
yes.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
that's
true
mr.
justice
brennan
and
i
would
think
the
commission
would
give
the
greatest
of
weight
--
i
would
think
whenever
a
concessionaire
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior
came
before
the
commission
stating
that
this
is
the
type
of
service
we'd
like
to
run
or
this
is
the
type
of
fare
that
we
propose
to
charge
and
that
would
be
accorded
almost
in
automatic
presumption
of
being
legitimate
because
the
commission
would
recognize
the
special
interest
that
is
involved
in
this
area.
if
you
recall,
not
all
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
are
all
embrace
here.
many
--
they
are
issued
involving
only
a
very
limited
scope
and
this
i
presume
would
be
the
case
in
so
far
as
the
secretary's
concessionaire
that
he
would
--
cannot
before
and
then
lend
certificate
to
serve
all
of
the
metropolitan
area
but
on
a
limited
basis.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
script
is
a
bad
word
to
use
recently
with
need
mr.
justice.
we've
been
on
this
script
system
involved
in
the
best
robberies
here
in
town.
yes
sir,
i
would
assume
all
aspect
of
this
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
all
aspect
of
such
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
i
assume
this
was
what
they
were
talking
about
and
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
i'm
sorry
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
thought
you
said
scrip,
s-c-r-i-p
and
you're
talking
to
the
scrip.
no
sir,
the
commission
would
have
very
little
interest
in
what
although
they
probably
commend
to
standard
to
service.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
we
would
--
i
don't
know,
i
can't
conceive
with
the
commission
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
having
any
jurisdiction
over
the
script
itself,
no.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
oh,
yes
sir,
i
think
a
very
legitimate
interest
just
as
the
carriers
today,
he
perform
the
selected
sightseeing
tours;
have
scripts
for
their
drivers
to
follow.
now,
we
have
no
concern
with
that
in
so
far
unless
there
would
be
some
vulgarity
or
something
like
that
of
this
nature
involved
but
i'm
sure
in
many
instance
we
have
no
idea
what
the
script
itself
even
affords
to
be,
and
some
of
them
are
even
on
tapes
in
some
of
the
carriers
in
multilingual
language.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
according
to
the
district
court
decision,
does
it
not
up
to
either
the
transit
commission
or
the
carriers
but
that
any
such
service
would
be
at
the
sufferance
of
the
secretary
of
interior
and
presumably
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
he
can
draw
his
curtain
around
the
mall
and
say
nobody
is
coming
in
here.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
no
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
secretary
has
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
never
been
known
as
a
regulator
of
transportation.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
i
don't
call
--
recall
mr.
justice
fortas
from
my
reading
of
the
contract
whether
there
is
an
exclusive
--
exclusivity
connected
with
it.
i
presume
there
that
there
is
because
otherwise
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
there's
other
service
on
the
mall
now.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
as
of
this
moment,
no
because
universal
is
not
running
the
service
but
i
would
assume
that
once
universal
begins
running,
it
would
be
in
the
secretary's
interest
to
discourage
other
service
because
he's
going
to
get
a
fee
for
it.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
that's
the
substance
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
well,
but
assume
that
universal
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
no
sir.
our
position
is
that
there
are
dual
--
there
exist
dual
jurisdiction
in
the
park
plans
and
that
anyone
wishing
to
operate
a
transportation
service
there
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
must
have
authorization
from
the
secretary
of
interior
to
operate
his
vehicles
on
the
park
property
and
he
must
also
have
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
from
the
commission.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
i
would
think
so,
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
the
other
way
around,
yes
sir.
i
think
this
is
strictly
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
a
situation
where
there
has
to
be
a
great
deal
of
committee
between
the
two
--
the
two
bodies.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
the
commission.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
sir.
solely
because
we
feel
that
under
this
scheme
of
regulation
for
this
metropolitan
area
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
the
commission
has
to
fit
every
form
of
transportation
into
the
overall
program.
now,
i
say
this
not
lightly
because
right
now,
i'm
sure
most
of
your
honors
are
aware
of
the
fact
that
we
have
literally
hundreds
of
buses
under
rush
hour
on
constitution
avenue,
hundreds
of
them
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
wish
some
of
those
buses
could
make
10
miles
an
hour
under
rush
hour
but
to
set
another
large
mass
transit
system
and
this
is
what's
--
what
we're
talking
about.
we're
not
talking
about
running
one
or
two
or
three
articulated
vehicles,
we're
talking
about
the
movements
of
thousands
of
people
a
day
on
these
vehicles.
now,
suppose
that
the
traffic
conditions
are
such
that
we
cannot
--
that
there
has
to
be
since
inner
scheduling
of
this
service
that
there
has
to
be
some
accommodation
made.
now,
if
the
commission
does
not
have
jurisdiction
overall,
the
secretary
says
he's
going
to
run
this
service
and
the
bus
carrier
say
we're
going
to
run
this
service
and
we're
in
a
irreconcilable
position
--
who
is
going
to
make
the
distinction?
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
sir,
they
can't
run
anywhere
else.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
every
single
street
that
they've
talked
about
in
the
--
this
initial
service
and
i
remind
you
sir
that
its
initial
service
operates
over
a
public
street
in
the
district
of
columbia.
i
don't
care
who
owns
it,
whether
it's
operated
--
whether
it's
owned
by
the
park
service
and
maintained
and
policed
by
the
park
service
or
whether
its
own,
maintained
and
policed
by
the
district
of
columbia,
it's
a
public
street
and
everybody
is
out
using
it.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir
and
that
the
service
that's
operated
today,
down
on
the
mall
today
is
on
a
public
road.
every
single
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
it
is
my
understanding
that
it
is
running
on
constitution
avenue
and
it
will
run.
how
else
can
it
run,
it
has
to
turn
around
down
at
the
capital
and
run
back
up
mr.
justice
white
and
they're
also
talking
about
running
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir,
very
much
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
this
--
the
service
that's
being
operated
today
i
think
without
question
is
in
the
secretary's
mind,
the
very
minimum
of
service
that
would
be
provided.
unquestionably,
he'll
want
to
extend
the
service
to
the
union
station
visitor
center.
unquestionably,
he'll
want
to
render
service
up
around
the
capital.
unquestionably,
he'll
want
to
run
it
up
around
to
the
white
house.
unquestionably,
he's
going
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
because
any
decision
you
make
here
mr.
justice
white
is
going
to
be
just
as
applicable
tomorrow
when
the
service
is
extended
another
block
or
another
two
blocks
or
across
the
river
to
arlington
cemetery
or
down
to
mount
vernon.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir
--
and
that's
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
the
one
the
commission
is
most
worried
about.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
well,
mr.
justice
white,
if
you
decide
this
question
on
a
basis
that
the
commission
--
the
secretary's
legislative
enactment
says
he
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
we
will
not
consider
any
other
legislative
enactment,
then
if
you
stop
there
that
would
be
one
thing
but
i
think
you've
got
to
take
this
one
step
further
and
say
--
is
this
a
--
is
this
service
to
be
provided
transportation?
now,
i
don't
think
there's
any
other
conclusion
that
you
can
come
--
can
come
to
other
than
that
it
is
transportation,
this
is
what's
going
on
down
--
going
to
be
going
on
throughout
the
mall
area
is
transporting
people.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
alright.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
that's
what
the
united
states
stated
here
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
now,
that
act
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
well,
i
don't
believe
it's
true.
that
act
states
as
follows.
the
reg
--
the
applicability
of
the
rules
and
regulations
prescribed
and
applicable
to
the
--
to
the
secretary
is
hereby
extended
to
cover
the
sidewalks
--
the
sidewalks
around
the
public
grounds
and
the
carriage
ways
of
such
streets
as
lie
between
and
separate
said
public
grounds
so
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
is
hereby
extended
to
cover
the
sidewalks
around
the
public
grounds
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
and
the
carriage
ways
of
such
streets
as
lie
between
and
separate
the
said
public
grounds.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
that
would
exclude
it
--
that
would
include
it
to
the
extent
for
example
that
the
streets
are
involved
now
perhaps
second
street
and
third
street
and
ninth
street
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
perhaps
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
but
now,
the
thing
the
commission
is
worried
about
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
the
rule
you
lay
down
here
will
also
have
to
embrace
transportation
to
ford
theater
to
the
whitehouse
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
to
the
visitor's
center
and
there
is
--
if
you
start
talking
about
connecting
streets
between
the
mall
and
the
visitor's
center
and
we've
got
it
as
space
of
four
blocks,
five
blocks
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
of
all
district
streets.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
i
really
don't
know
mr.
justice
warren
--
mr.
chief
justice
because
they
talk
about
lie
as
such
street
as
lie
between
and
separate
public
grounds.
now,
they're
not
referring
to
the
mall
here.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
and
there
are
--
and
there
are
perhaps
seven
or
eight
streets
which
separates
the
mall
from
the
visitor
center.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
but
of
course,
some
of
these
operation
is
out
on
--
on
the
d.c.
streets
and
not
just
going
across.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
i'm
--
if
you'll
defer
just
a
moment
sir,
i
want
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
to
get
to
my
map
down
here.
alright,
in
the
--
in
the
appendix
on
page
16
and
17
appears
a
map
and
it
shows
the
service
that
will
be
run
by
universal.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
on
page
16
and
17
of
the
appendix.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
if
you
will
note
that
the
lines
running
down
--
the
arrows
going
down
constitution
avenue
and
quite
obviously
these
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir,
exhibit
b.
the
service
contemplated
will
run
down
constitution
avenue
from
the
intersection
of
bacon
drive
and
constitution
avenue
to
fifteenth
street.
now,
that
street,
constitution
avenue
does
not
appear
to
be
a
street,
a
sidewalk
or
a
carriage
way
is
lie
between
and
separate
the
mall.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir
and
its
--
if
i
also
remind
your
honor
that
we
have
now
under
rush
hour
several
hundred
buses
going
down
that
street,
constitution
avenue.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
i
really
don't
know
what
it's
going
to
do
to
us
unless
this
transportation
is
subject
to
our
jurisdiction
because
one
of
the
problems
we
have
and
is
a
great
one
today
is
accommodation
of
vehicles
on
these
streets.
mr.
chief
justice,
you
recall
that
in
the
--
one
of
the
statutory
requirements
placed
upon
this
commission
which
is
never
been
placed
upon
a
transportation
agency
--
regulation
agency
before
is
the
alleviation
of
traffic
congestion
on
the
streets
of
the
district
through
the
regulation
of
the
mass
transit
system
and
this
is
going
and
it
could
cause
us
considerable
problem
but
the
biggest
problem
would
come
about
is
if
this
service
is
not
melted
in
--
in
an
orderly
fashion
with
the
other
service.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
no
sir.
the
service
now
being
--
i
say
no
sir,
i
--
you
understand
my
answer
is
limited,
my
knowledge
is
limited.
it's
best
to
my
understanding
that
a
service
is
not
operating
up
around
the
whitehouse
or
around
the
ellipse
today.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
it
is.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
i
believe
its
--
its
classified
as
one
of
the
streets
in
which
there
is
dual
jurisdiction
at
both
the
park
service
and
the
district
attend
to
at
least
that
they
maintain
them.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
mr.
chief
justice,
my
recollection
of
the
record
is
that
this
portion
of
constitution
avenue,
it's
shown
on
exhibit
b
is
owned
and
maintained
by
the
district
of
columbia
and
not
the
secretary
of
interior.
i
could
be
wrong,
it
could
be
another
section
but
that
was
--
that
was
my
understanding.
we
feel
that
--
that
the
language
of
section
1
that
this
case
really
must
turn
on
the
language
of
section
1
(a)
and
that
language
clearly
defines
the
scope
of
the
commission's
jurisdiction
and
that
is
that
it
is
transportation
and
embraces
the
person
who
engages
in
that
transportation.
now,
transportation
is
not
defined
in
the
compact
but
it
is
not
given
a
restricted
meaning
other
than
its
general
term
and
we
believe
that
the
service
that
will
be
engaged
in
by
universal
will
be
or
any
concessionaire
that
its
secretaries
will
be
transportation.
the
senate
report
to
this
legislation
stated
that
title
2
provides
the
regulatory
law
which
is
to
be
administered.
section
1
defines
the
scope
of
the
compact
and
the
transportation
covered.
now,
section
1
does
not
say
mass
transit
or
any
other
kind
of
specialized
service
but
is
--
uses
the
term
transportation
which
we
feel
embraces
all
types
of
transportation
services.
that
language
is
clear
non-unambiguous,
nevertheless,
it
is
urged
and
decided
below
in
the
court
--
in
the
district
court
that
the
term
transportation
does
not
really
mean
transportation,
it
means
mass
transit.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
quite
obviously
reversed
that
decision
and
felt
the
transportation
must
be
construed
to
mean
simply
all
forms
of
movement
by
motor
vehicle
of
people.
to
reach
the
determination
that
its
mass
transit
rather
than
transportation
per
se,
one
must
ignore,
number
one,
the
plain
language
of
the
law.
he
must
ignore
the
legislative
history.
he
must
ignore
the
historical
concept
of
regulation
and
he
must
ignore
previous
decisions
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
in
each
case,
that
court
said
that
this
commission's
jurisdiction
is
--
should
be
given
the
broadest
construction
possible
and
embrace
all
forms
of
transportation.
it
also
conforms
to
the
major
principles
of
law
that
remedial
statutes
of
the
like
the
compact
shall
be
broadly
construed
in
all
exemptions
narrowly
construed.
the
commission
feels
it
cannot
be
argued
or
denied
that
the
function
under
universal's
contract
is
that
universal
is
to
perform
a
movement
of
people
in
motor
vehicles.
this
service
is
going
to
be
operated
on
streets.
it's
going
to
be
operated
on
public
streets
regardless
of
who
is
the
owner
and
maintainer
of
that
street.
it
will
be
in
a
vehicle
that
will
be
owned
by
a
private
carrier.
it
will
be
driven
by
employees
of
that
private
carrier
and
as
the
contract
itself
specifies,
those
employee
shall
be
dressed
so
as
to
be
distinctly
known
as
universal
employees,
not
park
service
employees
but
universal
employees.
now,
what
happens
when
a
man
gets
on
at
the
end
of
the
--
of
the
mall
to
take
a
tour,
he's
not
only
getting
in
universal's
vehicles
driven
by
universal's
drivers,
he
pays
universal
a
fee
and
that
money
then
becomes
universal's.
clearly,
the
act
of
any
carrier,
any
common
carrier
in
this
country,
this
is
the
role
that
it
performs
and
that's
the
role
that
a
--
that
a
utility
carrier
provides
whether
that
act
is
done
for
the
general
public
which
is
this
case
here.
this
is
not
a
service
for
the
united
states.
it's
a
service
for
the
public.
now,
contrast
that
if
you
will
that
the
usac
transport
case
in
which
the
transportation
being
provided
there
was
to
the
federal
government
itself.
here,
the
service
is
not
being
provided
to
the
government,
it's
being
provided
to
the
millions
of
people
who
will
come
down
under
the
mall.
the
federal
government
is
giving
up
or
allowing
a
carrier
to
come
on
its
property
and
operate
and
perform
certain
services
that
it
request
and
would
like
to
see
perform
for
the
public
and
in
turn
receives
a
percentage
fee
of
the
fares
collected
through
the
fare
box
of
that
contract
carrier.
now,
today,
we
have
numerous
carriers
operating
under
contract
with
various
governmental
agencies,
department
of
state,
department
of
defense,
the
army,
the
navy
and
each
case,
those
carriers
have
authorization
from
the
commission.
now,
that
service
is
regulated
in
so
far
as
the
standard
of
service
is
concerned
and
in
so
far
as
fares
are
concerned.
we
have
not
had
one
single
conflict
with
those
governmental
agencies
in
so
far
as
what
service
they
want
and
what
service
is
directed
and
authorized
by
the
commission.
not
one
single
bit
of
difference
and
we
submit
your
honors
that
this
would
be
the
case
under
this
situation.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
feel
in
closing
i
would
like
to
stress
and
accentuate
two
points
as
to
which
we
feel
very
strongly
about.
first,
we
feel
that
there
must
be
an
accommodation
made
between
the
laws
of
the
secretary
of
interior
and
the
compact
itself.
otherwise,
we
fear
deeply
that
there
will
be
irreconcilable
conflicts
on
the
streets
of
washington
served
by
carriers
subject
to
our
jurisdiction
and
those
operating
pursuant
to
the
franchise
of
the
secretary.
we
feel
that
someone
must
be
in
position
to
resolve
any
irreconcilable
conflicts.
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
to
coordinate
and
improve
in
every
fashion
all
of
this
transportation
service.
this
may
be
accomplished
not
by
accepting
the
argument
of
the
petitioners
that
the
secretary's
laws
are
mutually
exclusive
and
cannot
be
app
--
in
the
compact
cannot
be
applied.
we
feel
there
isn't
only
that
there
will
be
no
mischief,
no
harm
done
if
the
court
accepts
the
view
of
the
commission
that
there
is
--
that
the
compact
is
applicable
that
dual
jurisdiction
does
exist
that
on
the
one
hand,
the
secretary
of
interior
has
those
ministerial
duties
and
the
right
to
organize
and
supervise
his
transit
service
on
the
mall
or
between
any
part
properties.
on
the
other
hand,
we
feel
that
the
congress
very
clearly
did
not
intend
that
any
public
transportation
service
would
be
excluded
from
the
regulation
by
the
transit
commission.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
that
is
true
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
quite
possibly,
quite
possibly
and
i
think
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
the
difference
is
mr.
chief
justice
that
i
feel
that
congress
when
it
enacted
the
exemption
by
the
federal
government
or
the
signatories
intended
to
leave
a
small
area
open
whereby
the
government
could
operates
its
own
service
and
follow
the
traditional
regulatory
scheme
--
statutory
regulatory
scheme
that
where
the
government
itself
provides
a
service
that
that
service
is
not
in
turn
regulated
by
another
governmental
agents
that
on
the
other
hand
where
it
does
require
a
private
carrier
to
provide
that
same
service,
then
that
service
must
be
regulated
and
that
is
the
holding
in
the
u.s.a.c.
transport
case.
that
has
been
the
holding
if
every
supreme
court
cases,
state
court
decision
that
i
know
of
sir.
this
is
the
primary
distinction
i
think
clearly
that
this
was
scheme
that
existed
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
compact
and
that
those
--
what
congress
in
the
state
legislatures
intended
to
be
accomplished
in
the
future.
now
we
don't
feel
that
there
will
be
any
problem
arising
under
this
dual
jurisdiction.
the
regulatory
agency
in
most
instances
accepts
the
managerial
decisions
of
the
owners
of
transit
companies
and
in
this
case,
the
secretary
is
free
to
contract
with
this
concessionaire
and
supervise
it
day
and
night.
we
welcome
a
service
of
this
kind
that
we
feel
that
there
must
be
an
accommodation
between
the
secretary
service
and
melding
of
that
service
in
the
supervision
of
that
service
under
the
regulatory
concept
by
the
commission.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
sir.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
i
think
mr.
justice
white
there
is
a
calming
wind
of
authority
here.
on
the
one
hand,
we
have
the
secretary
saying,
“i
will
allow
or
i
will
provide
certain
service
on
the
mall
area
and
i
will
exclude
what
service
that
i
feel
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
to
be
on
there.”
because
this
congress
said
“i
shall
administer
this
property.”
on
the
other
hand,
the
congress
has
also
said
“we
want
the
transit
commission
to
regulate
a
unified
transit
system
of
all
kinds
throughout
this
metropolitan
area.”
congress
i
feel
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes
sir,
i
think
it
does.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
i'm
saying
in
this
instance
wherever
a
governmental
agency
comes
in
and
i
would
think
in
this
case
it
would
--
being
the
secretary
of
interior,
we
carry
even
more
of
preponderance
of
evidence
in
light
that
if
the
secretary
came
to
the
commission
and
said
--
i'm
sorry,
if
a
concessionaire
came
to
the
commission
and
said,
“we
wish
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity,”
and
here
is
a
contract
from
the
secretary
of
the
interior
saying
that
we
are
the
only
carrier
that
he
is
going
to
permit
to
provide
this
service
on
the
mall.
i
would
think
it's
almost
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
--
maybe
rebuttable,
but
i'm
--
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
that's
correctly
right
mr.
justice
brennan
and
we
feel
this
is
what
congress
intended
when
they
set
up
the
commission
and
said
there
will
be
no
longer
political
subdivisions
of
any
kind
chopping
up
the
regulatory
agency
in
the
metropolitan
area.
we
want
one
agency
to
regulate
transportation.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
there
only
be
one
regulatory
agency,
yes
sir.
that
on
the
other
hand,
the
secretary's
powers
to
maintain
and
supervise
and
administer
the
mall
still
remains
open
to
him.
mr.
russell
w.
cunningham
yes,
sir.
and
we
feel
under
the
law
this
was
statutory
scheme
that
the
congress
and
the
legislatures
intended
that
not
only
the
secretary
of
the
interior
would
be
subject
to
this
control
but
any
municipality,
any
county,
any
other
federal
government
agency
and
in
fact
we
have
this
going
on
today
where
we
have
contract
services
between
various
carriers
and
various
federal
agencies.
i
went
in
to
that
aspect
yesterday.
mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
court
that
concludes
my
argument
this
morning,
mr.
davis
has
remainder
of
the
time
to
argue
the
franchise
issue
and
may
i
thank
you
gentleman.
