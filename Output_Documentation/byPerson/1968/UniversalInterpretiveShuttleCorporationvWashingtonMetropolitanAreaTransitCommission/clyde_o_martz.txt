mr.
clyde
o.
martz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
approves
and
incorporates
the
argument
that
has
been
made
by
the
petitioner
but
appears
here
as
amicus
and
in
the
court
below
in
representation
of
interest,
because
of
an
independent
and
broad
concern
that
the
authority
that
has
been
vested
in
the
department
of
interior
by
congress
and
in
other
areas
of
national
interest
not
be
subject
to
review,
modification
and
possibly
frustration
by
a
parochial
district
of
columbia
regional
regulatory
commission.
the
issues
in
the
case
we
think
are
simple.
congress
as
the
petitioner
has
shown
has
vested
the
interior
department
with
exclusive
charge
and
control
over
the
mall
area,
one
of
the
most
heavily
frequented
national
parks
in
the
whole
united
states.
by
express
act
of
congress,
the
director
within
a
park
service
has
been
given
authority
to
make
and
enforce
all
regulations
pertaining
to
movement
of
vehicles
in
the
park
and
to
extend
those
regulations
to
carriage
ways
that
may
intersect
parts
of
the
public
grounds.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
yes
mr.
justice,
well,
not
beyond
the
local
conflict
perhaps
but
this
case
has
been
to
the
court
before
mr.
justice
brennan,
basically,
in
united
states
against
wittek
the
question
of
the
proper
area
for
legislation
within
the
district
of
columbia
under
article
1
section
8
of
the
constitution
pertaining
to
municipal
affairs
one
hand
and
the
broad
national
legislation
particularly
with
respect
to
article
4
section
3
on
public
lands
on
the
other
and
the
compatibility
of
legislative
actions
between
those
two
areas
in
particular.
i
think
the
question
here
is
the
extent
to
which
the
broad
national
policies
promulgated
in
the
park
legislation
and
vested
by
congress
and
the
department
of
interior
should
be
de-modified
or
qualified
by
the
enactment
of
local
and
parochial
legislation
for
the
administration
of
the
municipal
government
of
washington
d.c.
in
the
region.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
paragraph
17,
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
clause
17
of
article
1
section
8.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
we
think
there
is
no
question
about
what
congress
has
given
exclusive
charge
and
control
to
the
secretary
over
the
national
parks.
it
has
as
petitioner
has
pointed
out,
placed
a
responsibility
upon
the
secretary
to
promote
the
use
of
these
parks
for
the
purposes
for
which
they
were
created
in
16
u.s.c.
1.
it
has
further
authorized
the
secretary
in
section
3
of
16
u.s.c.
and
encouraged
the
secretary
in
1965
by
section
20
(a)
of
16
u.s.c.
to
use
concessionaires
by
contract
in
the
performance
of
the
functions
of
the
secretary
within
the
national
park
on
cleave.
the
secretary
after
a
study
has
entered
into
a
compact
described
in
this
case
by
petitioner
in
march
of
1967.
for
18
months
and
two
tourist
seasons
that
compact
has
been
dormant
because
of
the
injunction
of
the
court
of
appeals
against
the
conduct
of
this
interpretive
service
by
concessionaires
within
the
national
park
on
cleave
without
certification
and
all
it
means
by
the
washington
metropolitan
area
transit
commissions.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
i
yes,
it's
a
--
excuse
me,
yes
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
--
forgive
me,
i
was
referring
to
the
contract
between
the
secretary
and
petitioner.
we
are
the
opinion
and
respectfully
submit
that
this
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
was
not
supported
by
opinion
but
only
an
order
that
said
in
substance
at
reading
the
relevant
statutes
one
with
the
other
does
not
permit
the
concessionaire
service
to
be
performed
without
certification.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
no,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
they
were
not
filed.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
we
submit
that
broad
order
is
erroneous
under
at
least
three
persuasive
if
not
controlling
decisions
of
this
court.
the
first,
wittek
against
or
united
states
against
wittek
on
the
question
whether
a
national
agency
authority
within
the
district
of
columbia
is
going
to
be
impliedly
negated
or
qualified
by
the
enactment
of
general
district
of
columbia
legislation.
a
second
question
arises
under
yearsley
against
w.
a.
ross
construction
company
as
to
the
question
whether
a
concessionaire
operating
under
the
close
supervision
and
control
of
federal
officers
in
the
performance
of
governmental
functions
is
an
agent
of
the
united
states
and
acts
in
place
of
the
united
states
and
in
context
would
be
subject
to
the
exclusion
for
transportation
by
the
federal
government
set
forth
in
article
12
section
1
(a)
of
the
compact.
and
third,
by
analogy
to
leslie
miller
incorporated
against
arkansas
where
this
court
said
the
mere
existence
of
duplicate
regulatory
authority
over
a
federal
activity
by
the
federal
government
under
one
hand
and
by
a
local
government
on
the
other
creates
conflict
and
is
a
frustration
of
the
federal
purpose.
we
submit
contrary
to
the
broad
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
if
this
be
so,
it
is
inconceivable
that
congress
would
place
administrative
control
over
any
part
of
the
national
park
program
in
a
tri-state
local
administrative
body.
we
submit
that
as
in
wittek.
so
here,
confusion
has
arisen
between
the
operation
in
effect
of
congressional
action
in
the
national
sector
and
the
operation
in
effect
of
congressional
action
on
the
local
sector.
the
problem
on
wittek
was
this.
did
the
emergency
rent
control
act
of
the
district
of
columbia
of
1940
apply
to
federal
low
rent
housing
and
defense
housing
within
the
district
of
columbia
which
was
then
under
the
control
of
the
national
housing
administrator
and
operated
by
the
national
capital
housing
authority?
in
that
respect,
this
court
said
on
page
351,
it
is
practically
inconceivable
that
congress
would
have
subjected
the
government-owned
low
rent
housing
program
in
the
district
of
columbia
to
the
additional
control
prescribed
by
the
district
of
columbia
emergency
rent
act.
and
on
355,
the
issue
is
whether
the
united
states
through
whatever
agency
it
operates
is
to
control
--
be
controlled
in
its
rental
policies
by
the
district
administrator
rent
control.
here,
we
were
not
concerned
with
an
interstate
or
a
state
agency
but
a
very
creature
of
congress
in
the
district
of
columbia
legislation
that
was
denied
that
authority.
but
more
--
even
more
important
on
358,
i
think
the
court
uses
language
that
could
almost
be
paraphrased
and
applied
to
the
problem
before
this
court.
it
said
the
act,
referring
to
the
district
of
columbia
emergency
rent
act,
contains
no
express
reference
to
the
united
states
as
a
landlord
or
to
the
application
of
the
act
of
government-owned
housing
of
any
kind.
the
text
surrounding
circumstances
and
legislative
history
of
the
district
act
neither
expressed
nor
imply
a
change
in
the
authority
already
vested
in
permanent
federal
agencies
in
their
management
of
the
government-owned
housing
in
the
district.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
united
states
against
wittek,
opinion
by
justice
burton
in
1949.
now
our
--
our
fact
situation
here
is
very
similar.
there
is
nothing
in
the
compact
and
for
that
matter
in
the
district
of
--
district
--
d.c.
transit
franchise
that
purports
to
extend
jurisdiction
into
the
national
park
on
cleave.
congress
has
operated
the
national
parks
throughout
the
country
under
article
4
section
3
and
the
district
of
columbia
under
article
1
section
8
clause
17
and
in
the
past
has
been
meticulous
to
try
to
separate
the
areas
of
conflict
within
the
district
of
columbia.
it
has
for
instance
we
think
in
every
instance
where
district
of
columbia
legislation
was
to
apply
within
the
national
park
on
cleave
to
expressly
so
provide.
it
has
considered
transportation
a
local
municipal
problem
handled
by
the
district
of
columbia
committees
in
congress.
back
in
1925
when
the
first
traffic
act
pertaining
to
motor
vehicles
was
enacted,
section
--
present
section
4613
was
included
that
provided
that
nothing
contained
in
this
chapter
shall
be
construed
to
interfere
with
the
exclusive
charge
and
control
here
to
for
committed
to
the
director
of
the
national
park
service
over
the
park
system
of
the
district.
this
section
has
never
been
repealed.
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
compact
or
its
legislative
history
to
show
that
congress
was
thinking
of
federal
park
properties.
there
is
much
which
is
set
out
in
our
brief
to
show
that
it
could
not
have
been
thinking
of
this
type
of
regulatory
extension.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
there
are
jurors
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
right.
there
are
some
local
parks
which
by
district
of
columbia
code
have
been
specified
either
because
of
their
size
or
location
as
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
of
columbia.
these
include
the
squares
for
instance
but
rock
creek
park
is
a
national
park.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
and
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
no,
it's
a
national
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
and
that
these
are
all
enumerated
in
detail
in
the
district
of
columbia
code
under
language
essentially
the
same
that
is
set
out
in
8108,
the
transfer
is
exclusive
charge
and
control
to
the
national
park
service.
counsel
advises
me
that
the
exception
i
should
have
said
was
--
was
playgrounds.
the
--
i
was
calling
on
this
--
the
small
areas
but
the
playgrounds
from
the
district
are
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
of
the
district.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
yes.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
i
can't
pursue
it
because
i've
never
checked
out
the
inclusiveness
of
the
question.
it
would
be
--
i
want
to
spend
just
a
moment
on
the
other
very
significant
aspect
of
our
case
which
is
the
exclusion
under
article
1
section
or
article
12
section
1
(a)
applicable
to
transportation
by
the
federal
government.
in
yearsley
against
w.
a.
ross
construction
company,
a
contractor
was
performing
service
for
the
corps
of
engineers
in
straightening
the
channel
of
the
missouri
river
and
was
under
the
supervision
and
control
of
the
corps
on
the
question
on
whether
he
was
subject
to
independent
liability
to
third
persons,
it
was
determining
that
he
was
acting
as
the
agent
of
the
government.
all
the
more
so
we
submit
in
this
peculiar
national
park
concession
situation
where
the
very
services
which
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
directed
to
perform
under
16
u.s.c
section
1
or
by
a
policy
of
congress
to
be
performed
by
concessionaires.
the
concessionaires
are
acting
under
the
supervision
of
the
director.
the
concessionaire
is
performing
a
service
that
the
government
is
obligated
to
perform.
it
is
the
act
of
the
united
states,
the
transportation
of
the
united
states
for
which
the
exclusion
was
intended.
it
would
elevate
form
over
substance
to
say
that
the
interest
of
transportation
in
the
district
of
columbia
is
affected
differently
by
the
operation
of
these
trams
wholly
within
the
national
park
on
cleave
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
not
with
respect
to
the
construction
of
a
compact.
there
would
be
a
threshold
question
as
to
the
authority
of
the
secretary
to
conduct
the
service
outside
the
park
area.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
but
if
the
secretary
had
the
authority
and
it
was
conveyed
to
him
by
congress,
then
we
would
submit
that
under
the
1
(a)
exclusion,
the
services
that
were
being
performed
for
and
on
his
behalf
would
be
services
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
well,
six
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
16
u.s.c.
section
1
authorizes
him
to
act
only
in
national
parks.
section
1
(b)
added
in
1953
authorizes
the
secretary
to
do
certain
things
outside
of
the
parks
in
emergency
situations.
when
the
secretary
has
engaged
in
services
outside
of
the
park
as
transportation
to
carlsbad
caverns,
he
has
obtained
special
authorization
by
congress
to
do
it.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
yes.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
as
far
as
the
issues
in
this
case
are
concerned,
we
would
submit
it's
irrelevant.
we
are
only
construing
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
what
the
language
of
the
--
we're
only
construing
what
the
language
of
the
compact
says.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
that
is
correct
your
honor
as
long
as
it's
contained
within
the
exception.
if
that
goes
beyond
what
the
compact
administrators
think
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
yes.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
no.
this
is
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
the
only
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
that
is
all
that
is
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
that
is
right
except
those
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
well,
no,
with
consent
of
congress
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
mr.
justice
white
because
in
8
--
d.c.
code
144,
the
secretary
was
given
authority
to
use
the
carriage
ways
intersecting
portions
of
the
public
grounds.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
part
of
them
are
and
part
are
not.
third,
forth,
ninth
and
fourteenth
i
believe
are
d.c's
streets
subject
to
the
authority
of
the
secretary
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
8
d.c.
code
section
144
provided
that
the
director
of
the
park
service
could
apply
his
regulations
to
carriage
ways
intersecting
the
public
grounds
and
the
only
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
yes,
we
think
there
is
no
question
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
no.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
you
know
the
--
answer
that
it
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
when
the
bill
was
before
the
house
public
works
committee
in
congress
last
spring,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
proposed
an
amendment
that
would
allow
the
extension
of
the
minibus
service
off
the
park
area
and
to
the
visitor
center
facilities
and
the
capital.
the
house
public
works
committee
didn't
extend
this
legislation
to
the
area
but
directed
the
secretary
to
investigate
it
and
make
a
report
but
i
would
--
i
would
anticipate
that
if
that
were
to
be
done,
the
statutory
procedure
would
be
followed.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
fortas
inquiries
pointed
out
that
we
have
apparently
failed
to
make
clear
to
the
court
that
we
have
two
separate
and
distinct
bases
for
reversal.
first
is
the
exclusion
of
the
united
states
and
its
concessionaire
under
the
transportation
for
federal
government
exclusion
in
article
12
section
1
(a).
the
second
and
completely
independent
basis
for
reversal
is
that
the
compact
by
its
terms
and
by
any
reasonable
construction
does
not
extend
into
the
national
park
enclave
and
does
not
purport
to
regulate
activities
of
the
federal
government
or
any
contract
party
it
might
use
in
connection
with
the
operations
in
the
mall.
on
this
latter
does
not
abate
rest
upon
the
exclusion
in
the
compact,
it
goes
to
the
scope
to
the
heart
of
the
compact
itself
and
i
take
the
legislative
history
and
the
language
of
the
compact
that
is
developed
in
the
briefs
will
make
this
abundantly
clear.
in
the
first
place,
the
compact
in
article
8
called
for
congress
to
enact
legislation
that
will
suspend
conflicting
federal
statutes
and
to
graft
jurisdiction
to
the
commission
to
carry
out
the
compact
so
far
as
necessary.
in
section
3
of
house
joint
resolution
402
consenting
to
the
compact,
congress
performed
this
function.
it
granted
to
the
commission
only
the
authority
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
authority
of
the
public
utilities
commission.
neither
of
those
commissions
in
fact
and
as
found
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
had
any
certification
authority
over
any
operation
within
the
federal
enclave.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
well,
mr.
justice
stewart
in
addition
to
the
specific
answers
that
were
set
out
in
anticipation
by
petitioner
yesterday,
it's
our
general
position
that
there
is
no
difference
in
construction
between
the
franchise
and
the
compact.
both
are
acts
of
congress,
the
construction
of
both
raises
the
question.
did
they
run
against
the
sovereign?
did
they
run
against
the
federal
park
enclave?
did
they
apply
to
a
performance
of
a
service
by
the
federal
government
within
that
enclave?
now,
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
we
submit
the
same
rules
of
construction
would
apply
to
determine.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
yes.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
that's
our
position,
condition
that
is
explained
yesterday
by
the
fact
that
this
is
a
concession
contract
in
accordance
with
congressional
policy
to
carry
out
the
governmental
program
within
the
national
park
enclave.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
the
franchise
by
its
terms
permits
termination
after
1963
without
liability.
the
district
of
columbia
could
do
that.
it
is
so
long
as
the
compact
remains
in
effect
subject
to
the
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
no,
i
shouldn't
say
so
long
as
the
franchise
remains
in
effect.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
i
think
obligated
to
protect
the
regular
service
of
the
franchise
operator.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
it
depends
upon
whether
the
franchise
extends
in
to
the
national
park
enclave
and
affects
the
operation
of
the
secretary
of
interior
directly
or
through
his
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
it
has
no
authority
to
do
so,
outside
of
the
park
enclave.
nothing
is
in
issue.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
that's
correct
and
respondent
has
acknowledged
this
by
getting
permits
for
the
movement
of
his
vehicles
through
the
park
enclave.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
from
the
secretary.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
that
is
correct.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
as
a
rule
of
construction,
a
front
of
a
franchise
is
not
--
to
run
against
the
sovereign.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
it's
a
contract
to
provide
protection
against
competition
by
private
enterprise
within
the
area
not
with
the
operation
of
the
government
itself
in
its
use
of
federal
properties.
in
this
connection,
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
map
that
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
at
page
88
of
the
appendix
that
sets
out
the
jurisdiction
of
the
park
and
shows
that
constitution
avenue
from
15th
street
west
which
was
question
yesterday
is
wholly
within
the
park
enclave
and
it
can
be
operated
not
under
the
section
8144
jurisdictional
provision
but
as
part
of
the
park
itself,
section
8108.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
from
15th
street
to
the
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
to
the
west
as
shown
on
government
exhibit
6
set
out
in
the
appendix
at
page
88.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
both
do.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
can
do
it.
under
the
laws
of
the
district
of
columbia,
the
federal
law,
park
police
can
police
all
park
lands
and
metropolitan
police
can
do
so
also.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
united
states
approves
and
incorporates
the
argument
that
has
been
made
by
the
petitioner
but
appears
here
as
amicus
and
in
the
court
below
in
representation
of
interest,
because
of
an
independent
and
broad
concern
that
the
authority
that
has
been
vested
in
the
department
of
interior
by
congress
and
in
other
areas
of
national
interest
not
be
subject
to
review,
modification
and
possibly
frustration
by
a
parochial
district
of
columbia
regional
regulatory
commission.
the
issues
in
the
case
we
think
are
simple.
congress
as
the
petitioner
has
shown
has
vested
the
interior
department
with
exclusive
charge
and
control
over
the
mall
area,
one
of
the
most
heavily
frequented
national
parks
in
the
whole
united
states.
by
express
act
of
congress,
the
director
within
a
park
service
has
been
given
authority
to
make
and
enforce
all
regulations
pertaining
to
movement
of
vehicles
in
the
park
and
to
extend
those
regulations
to
carriage
ways
that
may
intersect
parts
of
the
public
grounds.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
yes
mr.
justice,
well,
not
beyond
the
local
conflict
perhaps
but
this
case
has
been
to
the
court
before
mr.
justice
brennan,
basically,
in
united
states
against
wittek
the
question
of
the
proper
area
for
legislation
within
the
district
of
columbia
under
article
1
section
8
of
the
constitution
pertaining
to
municipal
affairs
one
hand
and
the
broad
national
legislation
particularly
with
respect
to
article
4
section
3
on
public
lands
on
the
other
and
the
compatibility
of
legislative
actions
between
those
two
areas
in
particular.
i
think
the
question
here
is
the
extent
to
which
the
broad
national
policies
promulgated
in
the
park
legislation
and
vested
by
congress
and
the
department
of
interior
should
be
de-modified
or
qualified
by
the
enactment
of
local
and
parochial
legislation
for
the
administration
of
the
municipal
government
of
washington
d.c.
in
the
region.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
paragraph
17,
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
clause
17
of
article
1
section
8.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
we
think
there
is
no
question
about
what
congress
has
given
exclusive
charge
and
control
to
the
secretary
over
the
national
parks.
it
has
as
petitioner
has
pointed
out,
placed
a
responsibility
upon
the
secretary
to
promote
the
use
of
these
parks
for
the
purposes
for
which
they
were
created
in
16
u.s.c.
1.
it
has
further
authorized
the
secretary
in
section
3
of
16
u.s.c.
and
encouraged
the
secretary
in
1965
by
section
20
(a)
of
16
u.s.c.
to
use
concessionaires
by
contract
in
the
performance
of
the
functions
of
the
secretary
within
the
national
park
on
cleave.
the
secretary
after
a
study
has
entered
into
a
compact
described
in
this
case
by
petitioner
in
march
of
1967.
for
18
months
and
two
tourist
seasons
that
compact
has
been
dormant
because
of
the
injunction
of
the
court
of
appeals
against
the
conduct
of
this
interpretive
service
by
concessionaires
within
the
national
park
on
cleave
without
certification
and
all
it
means
by
the
washington
metropolitan
area
transit
commissions.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
i
yes,
it's
a
--
excuse
me,
yes
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
--
forgive
me,
i
was
referring
to
the
contract
between
the
secretary
and
petitioner.
we
are
the
opinion
and
respectfully
submit
that
this
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
was
not
supported
by
opinion
but
only
an
order
that
said
in
substance
at
reading
the
relevant
statutes
one
with
the
other
does
not
permit
the
concessionaire
service
to
be
performed
without
certification.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
no,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
they
were
not
filed.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
we
submit
that
broad
order
is
erroneous
under
at
least
three
persuasive
if
not
controlling
decisions
of
this
court.
the
first,
wittek
against
or
united
states
against
wittek
on
the
question
whether
a
national
agency
authority
within
the
district
of
columbia
is
going
to
be
impliedly
negated
or
qualified
by
the
enactment
of
general
district
of
columbia
legislation.
a
second
question
arises
under
yearsley
against
w.
a.
ross
construction
company
as
to
the
question
whether
a
concessionaire
operating
under
the
close
supervision
and
control
of
federal
officers
in
the
performance
of
governmental
functions
is
an
agent
of
the
united
states
and
acts
in
place
of
the
united
states
and
in
context
would
be
subject
to
the
exclusion
for
transportation
by
the
federal
government
set
forth
in
article
12
section
1
(a)
of
the
compact.
and
third,
by
analogy
to
leslie
miller
incorporated
against
arkansas
where
this
court
said
the
mere
existence
of
duplicate
regulatory
authority
over
a
federal
activity
by
the
federal
government
under
one
hand
and
by
a
local
government
on
the
other
creates
conflict
and
is
a
frustration
of
the
federal
purpose.
we
submit
contrary
to
the
broad
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
if
this
be
so,
it
is
inconceivable
that
congress
would
place
administrative
control
over
any
part
of
the
national
park
program
in
a
tri-state
local
administrative
body.
we
submit
that
as
in
wittek.
so
here,
confusion
has
arisen
between
the
operation
in
effect
of
congressional
action
in
the
national
sector
and
the
operation
in
effect
of
congressional
action
on
the
local
sector.
the
problem
on
wittek
was
this.
did
the
emergency
rent
control
act
of
the
district
of
columbia
of
1940
apply
to
federal
low
rent
housing
and
defense
housing
within
the
district
of
columbia
which
was
then
under
the
control
of
the
national
housing
administrator
and
operated
by
the
national
capital
housing
authority?
in
that
respect,
this
court
said
on
page
351,
it
is
practically
inconceivable
that
congress
would
have
subjected
the
government-owned
low
rent
housing
program
in
the
district
of
columbia
to
the
additional
control
prescribed
by
the
district
of
columbia
emergency
rent
act.
and
on
355,
the
issue
is
whether
the
united
states
through
whatever
agency
it
operates
is
to
control
--
be
controlled
in
its
rental
policies
by
the
district
administrator
rent
control.
here,
we
were
not
concerned
with
an
interstate
or
a
state
agency
but
a
very
creature
of
congress
in
the
district
of
columbia
legislation
that
was
denied
that
authority.
but
more
--
even
more
important
on
358,
i
think
the
court
uses
language
that
could
almost
be
paraphrased
and
applied
to
the
problem
before
this
court.
it
said
the
act,
referring
to
the
district
of
columbia
emergency
rent
act,
contains
no
express
reference
to
the
united
states
as
a
landlord
or
to
the
application
of
the
act
of
government-owned
housing
of
any
kind.
the
text
surrounding
circumstances
and
legislative
history
of
the
district
act
neither
expressed
nor
imply
a
change
in
the
authority
already
vested
in
permanent
federal
agencies
in
their
management
of
the
government-owned
housing
in
the
district.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
united
states
against
wittek,
opinion
by
justice
burton
in
1949.
now
our
--
our
fact
situation
here
is
very
similar.
there
is
nothing
in
the
compact
and
for
that
matter
in
the
district
of
--
district
--
d.c.
transit
franchise
that
purports
to
extend
jurisdiction
into
the
national
park
on
cleave.
congress
has
operated
the
national
parks
throughout
the
country
under
article
4
section
3
and
the
district
of
columbia
under
article
1
section
8
clause
17
and
in
the
past
has
been
meticulous
to
try
to
separate
the
areas
of
conflict
within
the
district
of
columbia.
it
has
for
instance
we
think
in
every
instance
where
district
of
columbia
legislation
was
to
apply
within
the
national
park
on
cleave
to
expressly
so
provide.
it
has
considered
transportation
a
local
municipal
problem
handled
by
the
district
of
columbia
committees
in
congress.
back
in
1925
when
the
first
traffic
act
pertaining
to
motor
vehicles
was
enacted,
section
--
present
section
4613
was
included
that
provided
that
nothing
contained
in
this
chapter
shall
be
construed
to
interfere
with
the
exclusive
charge
and
control
here
to
for
committed
to
the
director
of
the
national
park
service
over
the
park
system
of
the
district.
this
section
has
never
been
repealed.
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
compact
or
its
legislative
history
to
show
that
congress
was
thinking
of
federal
park
properties.
there
is
much
which
is
set
out
in
our
brief
to
show
that
it
could
not
have
been
thinking
of
this
type
of
regulatory
extension.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
there
are
jurors
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
right.
there
are
some
local
parks
which
by
district
of
columbia
code
have
been
specified
either
because
of
their
size
or
location
as
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
of
columbia.
these
include
the
squares
for
instance
but
rock
creek
park
is
a
national
park.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
and
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
no,
it's
a
national
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
and
that
these
are
all
enumerated
in
detail
in
the
district
of
columbia
code
under
language
essentially
the
same
that
is
set
out
in
8108,
the
transfer
is
exclusive
charge
and
control
to
the
national
park
service.
counsel
advises
me
that
the
exception
i
should
have
said
was
--
was
playgrounds.
the
--
i
was
calling
on
this
--
the
small
areas
but
the
playgrounds
from
the
district
are
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
of
the
district.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
yes.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
i
can't
pursue
it
because
i've
never
checked
out
the
inclusiveness
of
the
question.
it
would
be
--
i
want
to
spend
just
a
moment
on
the
other
very
significant
aspect
of
our
case
which
is
the
exclusion
under
article
1
section
or
article
12
section
1
(a)
applicable
to
transportation
by
the
federal
government.
in
yearsley
against
w.
a.
ross
construction
company,
a
contractor
was
performing
service
for
the
corps
of
engineers
in
straightening
the
channel
of
the
missouri
river
and
was
under
the
supervision
and
control
of
the
corps
on
the
question
on
whether
he
was
subject
to
independent
liability
to
third
persons,
it
was
determining
that
he
was
acting
as
the
agent
of
the
government.
all
the
more
so
we
submit
in
this
peculiar
national
park
concession
situation
where
the
very
services
which
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
directed
to
perform
under
16
u.s.c
section
1
or
by
a
policy
of
congress
to
be
performed
by
concessionaires.
the
concessionaires
are
acting
under
the
supervision
of
the
director.
the
concessionaire
is
performing
a
service
that
the
government
is
obligated
to
perform.
it
is
the
act
of
the
united
states,
the
transportation
of
the
united
states
for
which
the
exclusion
was
intended.
it
would
elevate
form
over
substance
to
say
that
the
interest
of
transportation
in
the
district
of
columbia
is
affected
differently
by
the
operation
of
these
trams
wholly
within
the
national
park
on
cleave
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
not
with
respect
to
the
construction
of
a
compact.
there
would
be
a
threshold
question
as
to
the
authority
of
the
secretary
to
conduct
the
service
outside
the
park
area.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
but
if
the
secretary
had
the
authority
and
it
was
conveyed
to
him
by
congress,
then
we
would
submit
that
under
the
1
(a)
exclusion,
the
services
that
were
being
performed
for
and
on
his
behalf
would
be
services
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
well,
six
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
16
u.s.c.
section
1
authorizes
him
to
act
only
in
national
parks.
section
1
(b)
added
in
1953
authorizes
the
secretary
to
do
certain
things
outside
of
the
parks
in
emergency
situations.
when
the
secretary
has
engaged
in
services
outside
of
the
park
as
transportation
to
carlsbad
caverns,
he
has
obtained
special
authorization
by
congress
to
do
it.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
yes.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
as
far
as
the
issues
in
this
case
are
concerned,
we
would
submit
it's
irrelevant.
we
are
only
construing
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
what
the
language
of
the
--
we're
only
construing
what
the
language
of
the
compact
says.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
that
is
correct
your
honor
as
long
as
it's
contained
within
the
exception.
if
that
goes
beyond
what
the
compact
administrators
think
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
yes.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
no.
this
is
--
mr.
clyde

mr.

no.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
you
know
the
--
answer
that
it
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
when
the
bill
was
before
the
house
public
works
committee
in
congress
last
spring,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
proposed
an
amendment
that
would
allow
the
extension
of
the
minibus
service
off
the
park
area
and
to
the
visitor
center
facilities
and
the
capital.
the
house
public
works
committee
didn't
extend
this
legislation
to
the
area
but
directed
the
secretary
to
investigate
it
and
make
a
report
but
i
would
--
i
would
anticipate
that
if
that
were
to
be
done,
the
statutory
procedure
would
be
followed.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
fortas
inquiries
pointed
out
that
we
have
apparently
failed
to
make
clear
to
the
court
that
we
have
two
separate
and
distinct
bases
for
reversal.
first
is
the
exclusion
of
the
united
states
and
its
concessionaire
under
the
transportation
for
federal
government
exclusion
in
article
12
section
1
(a).
the
second
and
completely
independent
basis
for
reversal
is
that
the
compact
by
its
terms
and
by
any
reasonable
construction
does
not
extend
into
the
national
park
enclave
and
does
not
purport
to
regulate
activities
of
the
federal
government
or
any
contract
party
it
might
use
in
connection
with
the
operations
in
the
mall.
on
this
latter
does
not
abate
rest
upon
the
exclusion
in
the
compact,
it
goes
to
the
scope
to
the
heart
of
the
compact
itself
and
i
take
the
legislative
history
and
the
language
of
the
compact
that
is
developed
in
the
briefs
will
make
this
abundantly
clear.
in
the
first
place,
the
compact
in
article
8
called
for
congress
to
enact
legislation
that
will
suspend
conflicting
federal
statutes
and
to
graft
jurisdiction
to
the
commission
to
carry
out
the
compact
so
far
as
necessary.
in
section
3
of
house
joint
resolution
402
consenting
to
the
compact,
congress
performed
this
function.
it
granted
to
the
commission
only
the
authority
of
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
the
authority
of
the
public
utilities
commission.
neither
of
those
commissions
in
fact
and
as
found
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
had
any
certification
authority
over
any
operation
within
the
federal
enclave.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
well,
mr.
justice
stewart
in
addition
to
the
specific
answers
that
were
set
out
in
anticipation
by
petitioner
yesterday,
it's
our
general
position
that
there
is
no
difference
in
construction
between
the
franchise
and
the
compact.
both
are
acts
of
congress,
the
construction
of
both
raises
the
question.
did
they
run
against
the
sovereign?
did
they
run
against
the
federal
park
enclave?
did
they
apply
to
a
performance
of
a
service
by
the
federal
government
within
that
enclave?
now,
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
we
submit
the
same
rules
of
construction
would
apply
to
determine.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
yes.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
that's
our
position,
condition
that
is
explained
yesterday
by
the
fact
that
this
is
a
concession
contract
in
accordance
with
congressional
policy
to
carry
out
the
governmental
program
within
the
national
park
enclave.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
the
franchise
by
its
terms
permits
termination
after
1963
without
liability.
the
district
of
columbia
could
do
that.
it
is
so
long
as
the
compact
remains
in
effect
subject
to
the
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
no,
i
shouldn't
say
so
long
as
the
franchise
remains
in
effect.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
i
think
obligated
to
protect
the
regular
service
of
the
franchise
operator.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
it
depends
upon
whether
the
franchise
extends
in
to
the
national
park
enclave
and
affects
the
operation
of
the
secretary
of
interior
directly
or
through
his
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
it
has
no
authority
to
do
so,
outside
of
the
park
enclave.
nothing
is
in
issue.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
that's
correct
and
respondent
has
acknowledged
this
by
getting
permits
for
the
movement
of
his
vehicles
through
the
park
enclave.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
from
the
secretary.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
that
is
correct.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
as
a
rule
of
construction,
a
front
of
a
franchise
is
not
--
to
run
against
the
sovereign.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
it's
a
contract
to
provide
protection
against
competition
by
private
enterprise
within
the
area
not
with
the
operation
of
the
government
itself
in
its
use
of
federal
properties.
in
this
connection,
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
the
map
that
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
at
page
88
of
the
appendix
that
sets
out
the
jurisdiction
of
the
park
and
shows
that
constitution
avenue
from
15th
street
west
which
was
question
yesterday
is
wholly
within
the
park
enclave
and
it
can
be
operated
not
under
the
section
8144
jurisdictional
provision
but
as
part
of
the
park
itself,
section
8108.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
from
15th
street
to
the
--
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
to
the
west
as
shown
on
government
exhibit
6
set
out
in
the
appendix
at
page
88.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
both
do.
mr.
clyde
o.
martz
can
do
it.
under
the
laws
of
the
district
of
columbia,
the
federal
law,
park
police
can
police
all
park
lands
and
metropolitan
police
can
do
so
also.
