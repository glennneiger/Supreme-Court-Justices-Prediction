mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
mr.
chief
justice,
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
reversed
a
district
court
dismissal
of
the
complaints
of
respondents.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
required
that
the
district
court
restrain
the
operation
by
petitioner
under
a
concession
granted
by
the
secretary
of
interior
of
a
mobile
interpretive
service
on
the
mall
in
the
district
of
columbia,
until
petitioner
secured
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
from
wmatc,
the
washington
metropolitan
area
transit
commission,
the
local
agency
created
by
interstate
compact
between
the
states
of
maryland,
virginia
and
the
district
of
columbia.
a
mobile
interpretive
service
which
is
a
term
we're
going
to
be
using
throughout
this
proceeding,
the
purpose
of
this
kind
of
a
service
is
to
provide
essentially
the
same
type
of
narrative
guided
tour
as
the
park
service
which
of
course
is
a
department
within
the
interior
department,
the
park
service
provides
two
visitors
of
national
parks
across
the
country,
except
that
instead
of
providing
the
service
on
a
tour
which
goes
on
foot,
the
secretary
is
determined
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
provide
it
in
this
instance
by
using
motorized
trams
which
would
move
at
speeds
not
to
exceed
10
miles
an
hour
through
the
points
of
interest
and
around
the
points
of
interest
permitting
the
tour
to
go
on.
the
principal
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
operation
of
such
a
mobile
interpretive
service
by
the
secretary
through
a
concessionaire
is
subject
to
the
certification
and
regulatory
requirements
of
wmatc.
if
the
operation
proposed
by
the
secretary
of
interior
is
subject
to
wmatc
jurisdiction,
then
even
though
the
secretary
is
determined
that
there
is
a
need
for
the
service
on
the
mall,
wmatc
would
not
be
allowed
to
permit
the
service
to
be
conducted
unless
it,
wmatc,
the
local
agency
determined
that
there
was
a
need.
furthermore,
wmatc
would
have
the
obligation
to
determine
that
petitioner
was
qualified
to
render
this
service
even
though
the
secretary
had
made
the
same
determination
and
if
the
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
were
granted,
the
local
agency
would
also
have
the
responsibility
to
supervise
under
its
general
regulatory
powers
the
operations
of
this
concession
on
the
mall.
the
setting
of
the
case,
the
actual
physical
setting
of
the
case
takes
place
on
the
mall
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
when
i
use
the
term
mall,
not
--
i'm
using
a
little
bit
generally
because
it
could
--
it
embraces
park
areas
that
are
adjacent
to
the
mall
such
as
the
jefferson
memorial,
the
ellipse
but
these
are
areas
all
within
the
exclusive
charge
that
control
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
i
think
the
--
perhaps
the
best
description
of
the
secretary's
responsibilities
in
this
area
are
set
forth
in
sections
1
and
3
of
title
16,
united
states
code
says,
the
secretary
is
charged
with
the
obligation
to
preserve
the
--
by
such
means
and
measures
as
conformed
to
the
fundamental
purposes
of
said
parks
and
which
purpose
is
to
conserve
the
scenery
and
natural
and
historic
objects
and
the
wildlife
therein
which
i
guess
on
the
mall
is
probably
limited
to
squirrels
and
to
provide
for
the
enjoyment
of
the
same
in
such
manner
and
by
such
means
as
will
leave
them
unimpaired
for
the
enjoyment
of
future
generations.
in
line
with
this
responsibility,
the
secretary
determined
that
the
facilities
on
the
mall,
the
interpretive
facilities
on
the
mall
were
already
crowded
to
the
point
where
both
because
of
population,
pressures
and
vehicular
pressures,
he
could
no
longer
provide
adequately
for
the
visitor
interpretive
services
which
he
wish
to
provide
under
his
charge
of
responsibility.
using
the
authority
conferred
upon
him
by
title
16
including
sections
1
and
3
and
section
20,
the
secretary
issued
a
proposed
--
requested
proposals
from
private
concessionaires
to
operate
an
interpretive
service
on
the
mall
and
a
number
of
private
persons
responded
including
petitioner
and
including
the
respondent
d.c.
transit
with
proposals.
the
proposal
of
petitioner
was
selected.
the
director
of
the
park
service
mr.
hartzog
stated
that
he
felt
that
the
proposal
by
the
petitioner
provided
the
“best
means”
of
interpretation
and
operation.
he
also
stated
what
impressed
him
most
about
the
petitioner
was
its
“interpretive
qualifications.”
the
secretary
and
the
petitioner
entered
into
a
contract
in
march
of
1967
which
called
for
the
rendition
of
this
interpretive
service.
the
contract
specified
that
the
services
to
be
provided
on
motorized
trams,
each
tram
would
be
manned
by
a
driver
and
by
a
guide.
the
guide
or
interpreter
would
use
a
script
prepared
and
or
rather
approved
by
the
secretary
in
interpreting
the
mall,
this
because
he
felt
that
the
and
expressly
provided
for
it
in
the
contract
that
interpretation,
the
narration
part
of
the
service
was
a
prime
consideration.
the
secretary
wants
to
have
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
no
sir,
there
is
no
--
no
first
amendment.
at
least
--
at
least
if
there
is
one,
i
think
my
client
would
be
the
person
who
would
be
in
the
position
to
raise
it
and
we're
not
raising
it
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
secretary
would
have
complete
control
over
all
facilities,
over
the
employees,
over
the
qualifications,
over
the
training,
over
the
time
and
method
of
operation.
the
franchise
--
a
franchise
fee
of
3%
of
the
gross
would
be
paid
by
the
concessionaire
to
the
united
states.
at
the
time
universal
entered
into
this
concession
arrangement,
they
were
advised
or
actually
prior
to
that
they
were
advised
by
the
secretary
that
no
other
agency
had
economic
regulatory
jurisdiction
over
this
particular
activity,
including,
since
we
had
asked
the
question,
wmatc.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
actually,
i
wasn't
aware
of
the
fact
that
they
would
make
use
of
any
streets
outsides
of
the
park
area
because
the
streets,
the
section
8144
of
the
district
of
columbia
code
provides
that
the
streets
between
park
areas
are
under
the
regulatory
or
under
the
regulation
of
the
secretary.
the
trams
would
cross
streets
such
as
14th
street
and
so
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
there
would
not
be
any
pick-up
points
outside
the
park
area.
there's
one
problem
at
the
end
of
the
park
you
know
where
they're
doing
this
construction
at
2nd
avenue
or
2nd
street
where
the
trams
might
have
had
to
go
over
one
small
area
outside
the
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
park
service.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
temporary
service
which
is
being
operated
now
to
which
i'll
address
myself
later
that
is
not
going
that
far
and
staying
wholly
on
park
territory.
there
is
authority
if
the
service
is
to
be
extended
just
in
say
for
one
block
or
for
a
short
turnaround
area
of
a
park
territory
for
the
secretary
to
arrange
--
to
have
this
permitted
by
an
exchange
of
letters
with
the
d.c.
government.
arrangements
to
do
this
were
initiated
but
pending
the
outcome
of
this
litigation,
the
interior
department
did
not
pursue
them.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
it
does,
it
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
it
does
your
honor,
although,
one
of
our
theories
which
i
will
discuss
later
would
i
think
even
if
the
trams
operated
for
some
distance
off
the
park
property
would
mean
the
service
still
exempt
from
regulation
by
wmatc
for
reasons
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
section
8144
and
8108
specifically.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
yes,
except
to
the
extent
that
may
at
some
future
date
because
of
the
turnaround
problems
go
on
to
district
of
columbia
streets
for
a
--
you
know,
for
almost
what
i
would
cal
it
de
minimis
distance
and
provided
of
course
that
the
secretary
were
able
to
arrange
with
the
district
government
for
the
necessary
exchange
of
regulatory
authority
which
this
would
require.
the
dc
--
wmatc
initiated
this
action
in
the
district
court
when
petitioner
after
being
advised
by
the
secretary
refused
to
apply
for
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity.
the
united
states
immediately
intervened
by
filing
a
representation
of
interest
and
has
participated
throughout
these
proceedings
as
a
party
in
effect
either
under
the
representation
of
interest
or
as
an
amicus
at
all
times
supporting
the
position
of
petitioner.
pending
the
outcome
of
the
loss
--
of
this
action,
the
petitioner
has
not
operated
the
service.
starting
around
september
1,
the
secretary
utilizing
park
service
personnel
and
leasing
equipment
from
petitioner
has
in
fact
been
conducting
the
service
for,
well,
i
guess
that's
about
almost
two
months
now.
the
wmatc
complaint
at
page
5
of
the
appendix,
i
think
in
a
sense
really
sums
up
or
at
least
gives
a
feeling
as
to
what
wmatc
is
seeking.
they
say
that
unless
the
petitioner
applies
for
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity,
wmatc
will
be
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
determine
whether
the
petitioner
is
qualified
to
render
this
service
to
the
secretary
and
for
the
public.
now,
significantly,
an
underplayed
throughout
this
proceeding
is
the
fact
that
the
wmatc
has
not
particularly
emphasize
the
fact
that
if
the
compact
applies
not
only
with
the
sec
--
not
only
with
wmatc
have
the
right
to
determine
whether
we
are
qualified
but
they
would
also
have
the
right
to
determine
by
virtue
of
the
very
same
sentence
that
gives
them
the
former
power,
the
right
to
determine
if
the
service
is
even
needed.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
public
convenience
and
necessity
as
of
course
that
particular
regulatory
body
sees
it
and
we
--
the
very
at
least
we
could
have
a
clash
of
determinations
between
the
secretary
and
the
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
and
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
that
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
and
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
i
think
that's
the
first
statement
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
yes
sir.
the
secretary
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
well,
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
i
think
to
the
extent
that
it
would
further
substantiate
the
control
which
the
secretary
enjoys
over
park
lands.
in
this
context,
the
control
vis-a-vis
a
local
agency
when
based
upon
section
8108
and
8144.
however,
certainly,
there
are
other
areas
and
not
being
the
representative
of
the
government,
i
don't
think
i
can
speak
with
extreme
authority
on
it
but
there
are
other
areas
from
time
to
time
where
the
secretary
interior's
jurisdiction
in
other
park
areas
could
be
challenged
by
a
local
jurisdictions
and
i
assume
that
a
strong
precedent
here
would
be
a
very
convincing
that
the
secretary's
control
in
other
park
areas
would
be
vindicated,
but
we
are
dealing
here
only
with
the
interpretation
of
the
washington
metropolitan
area
compact
and
to
that
extent,
the
literal
application
of
this
decision
i
think
would
be
much
more
limited
than
that.
the
secretary
under
the
contract
has
control
over
the
hours
of
service,
the
points
of
interest
to
be
served,
the
rates
to
be
charged
the
public
and
of
course
that's
a
prime
factor.
the
records
to
be
kept
by
the
petitioner,
the
insurance
to
be
maintained,
in
other
words,
throughout
the
entire
contract
are
this
complete
scheme
of
regulation.
if
wmatc
is
correct,
then
they
would
have
the
power
to
determine
the
service
--
the
hours
of
service,
the
rates
to
be
charged.
they
could
suspend
the
rates.
they
could
postpone
the
effectiveness
of
rates.
they
would
have
--
they
would
have
the
usual
plenary
jurisdictional
powers
which
they
do
over
other
regulated
agencies.
the
petitioner
has
consistently
throughout
these
proceedings
resisted
these
assertion
of
power
by
wmatc
on
a
number
of
grounds
which
i
would
like
to
just
summarize
at
this
point
then
we
can
explore
the
ones
which
are
most
susceptible
to
oral
argument
at
this
time.
the
first
is
that
the
propose
service
is
exempt
from
regulation
under
the
compact
by
virtue
of
the
exception
contained
within
the
compact
for
transportation
by
the
federal
government,
that's
in
a
sense
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
namely,
that
even
if
the
service
were
off
of
the
mall
for
some
distance
if
--
if
this
is
transportation
“by
the
federal
government
when
provided
by
a
concessionaire,
it
would
be
exempt
from
the
compact
coverage.”
secondly,
congress
has
committed
the
mall
itself
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
it
would
be.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
is
the
issue.
the
--
mr.
cunningham
to
my
right,
mr.
russell
cunningham
on
behalf
of
wmatc
has
urged
that
transportation
by
the
federal
government
is
limited
to
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
the
express
exemption
is
just
“transportation
by
the
federal
government
and
that
goes
on
and
other
political
subdivisions
of
the
signatories.”
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
no,
not
at
all,
that
--
that's
the
very
first
issue
that
--
to
which
we
would
address
ourselves.
the
second
of
course
is
that
the
mall
itself,
that
is
there's
a
territorial
exclusiveness
of
the
jurisdiction
here
at
which
the
secretary
possesses
and
since
this
takes
place
in
--
within
that
area
it's
within
his
exclusive
charge
of
control.
the
third
is
that
this
kind
of
transportation
does
not
fall
within
the
basic
handle
by
which
wmatc
claims
jurisdiction
because
it
is
not
“transportation
for
hire.”
this
is
a
question
of
course
of
what
is
meant
by
the
term
transportation
for
hire.
lastly,
d.c.
transit
has
claimed
that
under
its
franchise
which
is
granted
in
1956,
it
has
quite
a
part
from
the
compact
an
independent
basis
for
claiming
that
before
the
petitioner
can
operate
its
service,
it
must
obtain
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity.
i'd
like
to
focus
on
the
point
that
mr.
justice
fortas
has
just
mentioned
and
that
is
whether
this
is
transportation
by
the
federal
government.
in
our
view,
transportation
by
the
federal
government
is
present
in
this
case
because
the
first
place,
the
secretary
is
discharge
--
is
discharging
through
this
concessionaire
a
fundamental
function
which
he
has
traditionally
and
historically
furnished
either
directly
or
through
concessionaires.
secondly,
the
federal
government
through
the
secretary
has
control
over
every
phase
of
this
operation
to
the
same
extent
as
it
would
if
it
were
conducted
by
its
own
employees.
perhaps
even
more
because
you
don't
have
certain
things
like
civil
service
regulations
which
would
permit
people
--
prevent
people
from
being
discharged
in
that
sense.
thirdly,
the
petitioner's
day
to
day
activity
will
be
physically
intertwined
with
those
of
the
park
service.
the
trams
will
bear
a
park
service
emblems,
the
personnel
will
wear
uniforms
approved
by
the
park
service.
the
script,
the
narrative
script,
the
first
amendment
problem
which
is
the
very
heart
of
the
service
will
be
subject
to
the
park
service's
approval.
the
schedule
of
service,
the
operation
will
be
tailored
to
the
day
to
day
changing
needs
on
the
mall
so
that
if
something
has
taken
place
at
this
masonian
institute,
the
service
can
be
rerouted
either
to
take
that
into
account
or
move
around
it.
whether
viewed
from
the
standpoint
of
the
public
who
are
the
beneficiaries
of
this
service
or
from
the
standpoint
of
wmatc's
own
regulatory
jurisdiction,
it
makes
no
difference
that
the
secretary
has
decided
to
do
this
service
through
a
private
concessionaire
as
opposed
to
simply
using
his
own
vehicles
and
his
own
personnel,
the
control
element,
the
discharge
of
his
responsibility
elements
are
all
there.
finally,
quite
apart
from
this
of
course
is
the
exclusive
charge
and
control
which
the
secretary
enjoys
over
the
mall.
since
1898,
in
a
statute
not
codified
in
section
8108,
the
exclusive
charge
to
control
has
been
delegated
now
to
the
secretary
of
interior
over
these
areas
and
this
was
made
clear
in
1909,
when
congress
extended
this
charge
to
control
to
the
roads
between
park
areas
and
to
the
sidewalks
adjacent
to
park
areas.
the
public
utilities
commission
and
the
icc
never
were
given
any
statutory
authority
to
regulate
activities
within
this
mall
area.
now,
petitioner's
--
we've
been
met
by
the
point
by
respondents
that
the
puc
in
fact
did
regulate
bus
lines
because
they
certified
an
example,
one
example
was
given
of
a
bus
line
that
went
through
a
various
points
to
the
district
of
columbia
and
went
on
washington
drive
which
is
of
course
is
part
of
the
mall
over
by
the
national
galleria
and
national
art
gallery.
well,
of
course,
this
regulation
was
not
hostile
to
the
secretary.
there
would
be
no
incentive
for
him
as
long
as
he
wanted
to
permit
the
--
as
long
as
he
was
willing
to
permit
the
service
to
be
conducted
on
the
mall
there
and
did
not
exclude
the
vehicles,
there
really
wasn't
worth
anything
for
him
to
do,
was
he
to
go
to
wmatc
and
say
take
that
one
line
out
so
that
your
certificate
will
read
up
to
the
mall
then
we'll
be
silent
about
what
happens
in
the
mall
and
then
extends
beyond
the
mall?
no,
there
is
no
point
to
that.
there
is
no
advantage
to
him.
the
point
is
that
when
there
is
not
conflicting
--
when
there
are
not
conflicting
regulatory
schemes
and
if
the
secretary
is
willing
to
let
the
activity
continue,
there
is
no
reason
for
him
to
interfere.
however,
here
we
have
an
activity
on
the
part
of
a
secretary
himself
through
a
concessionaire
which
he
does
not
want
interference
and
that
i
think
is
the
essential
point,
the
difference
between
the
fact
that
the
puc
might
have
in
the
course
of
regulating
carriers
whose
activities
were
--
could
be
and
were
substantially
outside
the
mall
area,
also,
probably
without
even
thinking
about
it
inserted
the
reference
to
the
traveling
one
block
in
the
mall
area.
the
same
thing
of
course
would
apply
to
taxi
cabs.
we've
seen
the
maps
in
the
back
of
a
taxi
cabs
and
there
is
not
a
big
block
out
there
for
the
rates
to
be
charged
in
the
mall
area
but
what
good
would
that
would
have
done?
i'm
sure
the
secretary
activity
if
he's
going
to
permit
cabs
on
the
mall,
i'm
sure
he's
not
going
to
try
and
prevent
them
from
a
rate
structure
to
be
imposed
by
the
applicable
authority
who
gets
jurisdiction
because
the
activity
is
outside
of
the
mall.
finally,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
d.c.
transit's
point
that
its
franchise
gives
it
the
right
to
insist
on
certification.
the
franchise
which
is
set
forth
on
page
36
(a)
at
sect
of
our
brief
towards
the
rear
provides
first
a
grant
of
authority
to
d.c.
transit
to
operate
a
mass
transit
system.
then
in
section
6,
there
is
also
a
grant
to
the
d.c.
transit
the
right
to
operate
special
charter
and
sightseeing
services.
section
3
contains
a
provision
that
no
competitive
street
railway
or
bus
line,
that
is
a
bus
line
for
the
transportation
of
passengers
or
the
character
which
runs
over
a
given
route
on
a
fixed
schedule
should
be
permitted
without
a
--
without
certification
by
wmatc
as
to
its
necessity.
now,
we
interpret
that
to
apply
number
one
only
to
the
regular
route
service
of
d.c.
transit
because
this
in
effect
not
monopoly
but
this
protection
to
be
afforded
to
wmatc
was
meant
to
protect
the
service
which
he
was
being
required
to
render
and
that
is
its
regular
route
service,
not
a
permissive
--
not
a
permissive
service
of
sightseeing.
the
language
competitive
street
railway
line
which
runs
over
a
given
route
on
a
fix
schedule,
if
they
didn't
insert
the
competitive,
maybe
you
could
argue
it
also
protected
the
--
the
sightseeing
service.
and
certainly,
as
the
district
court
found,
this
not
--
this
does
not
compete
at
least
any
significant
way
with
the
regular
route
service.
i
think
it's
rather
hard
to
envision
a
tram
moving
at
less
than
10
miles
an
hour
from
various
points
around
the
mall
as
competing
with
the
regular
route
service
of
d.c.
transit.
but
even
if
section
3
extends
its
protection
to
d.c.
transit's
sightseeing
activities,
we
still
believe
that
it
is
not
applicable
because
it
requires
that
the
service
which
is
being
limited
or
prohibited
itself
must
travel
over
a
given
route
on
a
fix
schedule
and
this
service
being
provided
by
petitioner
will
be
subject
to
change
from
day
to
day
by
the
secretary
to
meet
the
changing
needs
on
the
mall.
also,
it
is
not
within
the
usual
concept
of
what
is
regular
route
service
in
the
meaning
usually
given
to
that
term
in
public
utility
proceedings.
it
says
a
given
route
on
a
fix
schedule,
that
is
language
which
is
meant
to
mean
regular
route
service
as
far
as
we
can
see
it
and
regular
route
service,
the
best
discussion
of
that
i've
seen
is
in
the
case
cited
by
respondent
--
by
respondent
d.c.
transit
in
bingler,
where
the
district
court
pointed
out
that
sightseeing
service
or
tourist
service
even
if
it
went
basically
on
a
relatively
fix
schedule
does
not
come
within
the
concept
of
regular
route
service
unless
it
--
if
there
is
something
significant
added
in
addition
to
the
expeditious
transportation
between
points.
in
our
case,
we
don't
even
have
expeditious
transportation
between
points,
its
going
to
too
slow
and
we
have
the
something
substantial
added
in
the
sense
that
the
interpretive
service
which
is
certainly
within
that
concept
of
something
substantial
added,
that's
the
reason
why
people
would
be
taking
the
service
is
--
is
present
in
this
case.
therefore,
we
can
see
that
d.c.
transit's
independent
argument
has
no
merit.
for
the
reasons
which
we
have
advanced,
we
believe
the
court
and
respectfully
request
the
court
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
remand
the
case
for
the
direction
that
the
complaints
be
dismissed.
thank
you.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
mr.
chief
justice,
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
which
reversed
a
district
court
dismissal
of
the
complaints
of
respondents.
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
required
that
the
district
court
restrain
the
operation
by
petitioner
under
a
concession
granted
by
the
secretary
of
interior
of
a
mobile
interpretive
service
on
the
mall
in
the
district
of
columbia,
until
petitioner
secured
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
from
wmatc,
the
washington
metropolitan
area
transit
commission,
the
local
agency
created
by
interstate
compact
between
the
states
of
maryland,
virginia
and
the
district
of
columbia.
a
mobile
interpretive
service
which
is
a
term
we're
going
to
be
using
throughout
this
proceeding,
the
purpose
of
this
kind
of
a
service
is
to
provide
essentially
the
same
type
of
narrative
guided
tour
as
the
park
service
which
of
course
is
a
department
within
the
interior
department,
the
park
service
provides
two
visitors
of
national
parks
across
the
country,
except
that
instead
of
providing
the
service
on
a
tour
which
goes
on
foot,
the
secretary
is
determined
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
provide
it
in
this
instance
by
using
motorized
trams
which
would
move
at
speeds
not
to
exceed
10
miles
an
hour
through
the
points
of
interest
and
around
the
points
of
interest
permitting
the
tour
to
go
on.
the
principal
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
operation
of
such
a
mobile
interpretive
service
by
the
secretary
through
a
concessionaire
is
subject
to
the
certification
and
regulatory
requirements
of
wmatc.
if
the
operation
proposed
by
the
secretary
of
interior
is
subject
to
wmatc
jurisdiction,
then
even
though
the
secretary
is
determined
that
there
is
a
need
for
the
service
on
the
mall,
wmatc
would
not
be
allowed
to
permit
the
service
to
be
conducted
unless
it,
wmatc,
the
local
agency
determined
that
there
was
a
need.
furthermore,
wmatc
would
have
the
obligation
to
determine
that
petitioner
was
qualified
to
render
this
service
even
though
the
secretary
had
made
the
same
determination
and
if
the
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity
were
granted,
the
local
agency
would
also
have
the
responsibility
to
supervise
under
its
general
regulatory
powers
the
operations
of
this
concession
on
the
mall.
the
setting
of
the
case,
the
actual
physical
setting
of
the
case
takes
place
on
the
mall
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
when
i
use
the
term
mall,
not
--
i'm
using
a
little
bit
generally
because
it
could
--
it
embraces
park
areas
that
are
adjacent
to
the
mall
such
as
the
jefferson
memorial,
the
ellipse
but
these
are
areas
all
within
the
exclusive
charge
that
control
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
i
think
the
--
perhaps
the
best
description
of
the
secretary's
responsibilities
in
this
area
are
set
forth
in
sections
1
and
3
of
title
16,
united
states
code
says,
the
secretary
is
charged
with
the
obligation
to
preserve
the
--
by
such
means
and
measures
as
conformed
to
the
fundamental
purposes
of
said
parks
and
which
purpose
is
to
conserve
the
scenery
and
natural
and
historic
objects
and
the
wildlife
therein
which
i
guess
on
the
mall
is
probably
limited
to
squirrels
and
to
provide
for
the
enjoyment
of
the
same
in
such
manner
and
by
such
means
as
will
leave
them
unimpaired
for
the
enjoyment
of
future
generations.
in
line
with
this
responsibility,
the
secretary
determined
that
the
facilities
on
the
mall,
the
interpretive
facilities
on
the
mall
were
already
crowded
to
the
point
where
both
because
of
population,
pressures
and
vehicular
pressures,
he
could
no
longer
provide
adequately
for
the
visitor
interpretive
services
which
he
wish
to
provide
under
his
charge
of
responsibility.
using
the
authority
conferred
upon
him
by
title
16
including
sections
1
and
3
and
section
20,
the
secretary
issued
a
proposed
--
requested
proposals
from
private
concessionaires
to
operate
an
interpretive
service
on
the
mall
and
a
number
of
private
persons
responded
including
petitioner
and
including
the
respondent
d.c.
transit
with
proposals.
the
proposal
of
petitioner
was
selected.
the
director
of
the
park
service
mr.
hartzog
stated
that
he
felt
that
the
proposal
by
the
petitioner
provided
the
“best
means”
of
interpretation
and
operation.
he
also
stated
what
impressed
him
most
about
the
petitioner
was
its
“interpretive
qualifications.”
the
secretary
and
the
petitioner
entered
into
a
contract
in
march
of
1967
which
called
for
the
rendition
of
this
interpretive
service.
the
contract
specified
that
the
services
to
be
provided
on
motorized
trams,
each
tram
would
be
manned
by
a
driver
and
by
a
guide.
the
guide
or
interpreter
would
use
a
script
prepared
and
or
rather
approved
by
the
secretary
in
interpreting
the
mall,
this
because
he
felt
that
the
and
expressly
provided
for
it
in
the
contract
that
interpretation,
the
narration
part
of
the
service
was
a
prime
consideration.
the
secretary
wants
to
have
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
no
sir,
there
is
no
--
no
first
amendment.
at
least
--
at
least
if
there
is
one,
i
think
my
client
would
be
the
person
who
would
be
in
the
position
to
raise
it
and
we're
not
raising
it
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
secretary
would
have
complete
control
over
all
facilities,
over
the
employees,
over
the
qualifications,
over
the
training,
over
the
time
and
method
of
operation.
the
franchise
--
a
franchise
fee
of
3%
of
the
gross
would
be
paid
by
the
concessionaire
to
the
united
states.
at
the
time
universal
entered
into
this
concession
arrangement,
they
were
advised
or
actually
prior
to
that
they
were
advised
by
the
secretary
that
no
other
agency
had
economic
regulatory
jurisdiction
over
this
particular
activity,
including,
since
we
had
asked
the
question,
wmatc.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
actually,
i
wasn't
aware
of
the
fact
that
they
would
make
use
of
any
streets
outsides
of
the
park
area
because
the
streets,
the
section
8144
of
the
district
of
columbia
code
provides
that
the
streets
between
park
areas
are
under
the
regulatory
or
under
the
regulation
of
the
secretary.
the
trams
would
cross
streets
such
as
14th
street
and
so
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
there
would
not
be
any
pick-up
points
outside
the
park
area.
there's
one
problem
at
the
end
of
the
park
you
know
where
they're
doing
this
construction
at
2nd
avenue
or
2nd
street
where
the
trams
might
have
had
to
go
over
one
small
area
outside
the
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
park
service.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
temporary
service
which
is
being
operated
now
to
which
i'll
address
myself
later
that
is
not
going
that
far
and
staying
wholly
on
park
territory.
there
is
authority
if
the
service
is
to
be
extended
just
in
say
for
one
block
or
for
a
short
turnaround
area
of
a
park
territory
for
the
secretary
to
arrange
--
to
have
this
permitted
by
an
exchange
of
letters
with
the
d.c.
government.
arrangements
to
do
this
were
initiated
but
pending
the
outcome
of
this
litigation,
the
interior
department
did
not
pursue
them.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
it
does,
it
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
it
does
your
honor,
although,
one
of
our
theories
which
i
will
discuss
later
would
i
think
even
if
the
trams
operated
for
some
distance
off
the
park
property
would
mean
the
service
still
exempt
from
regulation
by
wmatc
for
reasons
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
section
8144
and
8108
specifically.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
yes,
except
to
the
extent
that
may
at
some
future
date
because
of
the
turnaround
problems
go
on
to
district
of
columbia
streets
for
a
--
you
know,
for
almost
what
i
would
cal
it
de
minimis
distance
and
provided
of
course
that
the
secretary
were
able
to
arrange
with
the
district
government
for
the
necessary
exchange
of
regulatory
authority
which
this
would
require.
the
dc
--
wmatc
initiated
this
action
in
the
district
court
when
petitioner
after
being
advised
by
the
secretary
refused
to
apply
for
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity.
the
united
states
immediately
intervened
by
filing
a
representation
of
interest
and
has
participated
throughout
these
proceedings
as
a
party
in
effect
either
under
the
representation
of
interest
or
as
an
amicus
at
all
times
supporting
the
position
of
petitioner.
pending
the
outcome
of
the
loss
--
of
this
action,
the
petitioner
has
not
operated
the
service.
starting
around
september
1,
the
secretary
utilizing
park
service
personnel
and
leasing
equipment
from
petitioner
has
in
fact
been
conducting
the
service
for,
well,
i
guess
that's
about
almost
two
months
now.
the
wmatc
complaint
at
page
5
of
the
appendix,
i
think
in
a
sense
really
sums
up
or
at
least
gives
a
feeling
as
to
what
wmatc
is
seeking.
they
say
that
unless
the
petitioner
applies
for
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity,
wmatc
will
be
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
determine
whether
the
petitioner
is
qualified
to
render
this
service
to
the
secretary
and
for
the
public.
now,
significantly,
an
underplayed
throughout
this
proceeding
is
the
fact
that
the
wmatc
has
not
particularly
emphasize
the
fact
that
if
the
compact
applies
not
only
with
the
sec
--
not
only
with
wmatc
have
the
right
to
determine
whether
we
are
qualified
but
they
would
also
have
the
right
to
determine
by
virtue
of
the
very
same
sentence
that
gives
them
the
former
power,
the
right
to
determine
if
the
service
is
even
needed.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
public
convenience
and
necessity
as
of
course
that
particular
regulatory
body
sees
it
and
we
--
the
very
at
least
we
could
have
a
clash
of
determinations
between
the
secretary
and
the
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
and
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
that
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
and
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
i
think
that's
the
first
statement
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
yes
sir.
the
secretary
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
well,
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
i
think
to
the
extent
that
it
would
further
substantiate
the
control
which
the
secretary
enjoys
over
park
lands.
in
this
context,
the
control
vis-a-vis
a
local
agency
when
based
upon
section
8108
and
8144.
however,
certainly,
there
are
other
areas
and
not
being
the
representative
of
the
government,
i
don't
think
i
can
speak
with
extreme
authority
on
it
but
there
are
other
areas
from
time
to
time
where
the
secretary
interior's
jurisdiction
in
other
park
areas
could
be
challenged
by
a
local
jurisdictions
and
i
assume
that
a
strong
precedent
here
would
be
a
very
convincing
that
the
secretary's
control
in
other
park
areas
would
be
vindicated,
but
we
are
dealing
here
only
with
the
interpretation
of
the
washington
metropolitan
area
compact
and
to
that
extent,
the
literal
application
of
this
decision
i
think
would
be
much
more
limited
than
that.
the
secretary
under
the
contract
has
control
over
the
hours
of
service,
the
points
of
interest
to
be
served,
the
rates
to
be
charged
the
public
and
of
course
that's
a
prime
factor.
the
records
to
be
kept
by
the
petitioner,
the
insurance
to
be
maintained,
in
other
words,
throughout
the
entire
contract
are
this
complete
scheme
of
regulation.
if
wmatc
is
correct,
then
they
would
have
the
power
to
determine
the
service
--
the
hours
of
service,
the
rates
to
be
charged.
they
could
suspend
the
rates.
they
could
postpone
the
effectiveness
of
rates.
they
would
have
--
they
would
have
the
usual
plenary
jurisdictional
powers
which
they
do
over
other
regulated
agencies.
the
petitioner
has
consistently
throughout
these
proceedings
resisted
these
assertion
of
power
by
wmatc
on
a
number
of
grounds
which
i
would
like
to
just
summarize
at
this
point
then
we
can
explore
the
ones
which
are
most
susceptible
to
oral
argument
at
this
time.
the
first
is
that
the
propose
service
is
exempt
from
regulation
under
the
compact
by
virtue
of
the
exception
contained
within
the
compact
for
transportation
by
the
federal
government,
that's
in
a
sense
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
stewart's
question,
namely,
that
even
if
the
service
were
off
of
the
mall
for
some
distance
if
--
if
this
is
transportation
“by
the
federal
government
when
provided
by
a
concessionaire,
it
would
be
exempt
from
the
compact
coverage.”
secondly,
congress
has
committed
the
mall
itself
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
it
would
be.
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
is
the
issue.
the
--
mr.
cunningham
to
my
right,
mr.
russell
cunningham
on
behalf
of
wmatc
has
urged
that
transportation
by
the
federal
government
is
limited
to
--
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
the
express
exemption
is
just
“transportation
by
the
federal
government
and
that
goes
on
and
other
political
subdivisions
of
the
signatories.”
mr.
jeffrey
l.
nagin
no,
not
at
all,
that
--
that's
the
very
first
issue
that
--
to
which
we
would
address
ourselves.
the
second
of
course
is
that
the
mall
itself,
that
is
there's
a
territorial
exclusiveness
of
the
jurisdiction
here
at
which
the
secretary
possesses
and
since
this
takes
place
in
--
within
that
area
it's
within
his
exclusive
charge
of
control.
the
third
is
that
this
kind
of
transportation
does
not
fall
within
the
basic
handle
by
which
wmatc
claims
jurisdiction
because
it
is
not
“transportation
for
hire.”
this
is
a
question
of
course
of
what
is
meant
by
the
term
transportation
for
hire.
lastly,
d.c.
transit
has
claimed
that
under
its
franchise
which
is
granted
in
1956,
it
has
quite
a
part
from
the
compact
an
independent
basis
for
claiming
that
before
the
petitioner
can
operate
its
service,
it
must
obtain
a
certificate
of
convenience
and
necessity.
i'd
like
to
focus
on
the
point
that
mr.
justice
fortas
has
just
mentioned
and
that
is
whether
this
is
transportation
by
the
federal
government.
in
our
view,
transportation
by
the
federal
government
is
present
in
this
case
because
the
first
place,
the
secretary
is
discharge
--
is
discharging
through
this
concessionaire
a
fundamental
function
which
he
has
traditionally
and
historically
furnished
either
directly
or
through
concessionaires.
secondly,
the
federal
government
through
the
secretary
has
control
over
every
phase
of
this
operation
to
the
same
extent
as
it
would
if
it
were
conducted
by
its
own
employees.
perhaps
even
more
because
you
don't
have
certain
things
like
civil
service
regulations
which
would
permit
people
--
prevent
people
from
being
discharged
in
that
sense.
thirdly,
the
petitioner's
day
to
day
activity
will
be
physically
intertwined
with
those
of
the
park
service.
the
trams
will
bear
a
park
service
emblems,
the
personnel
will
wear
uniforms
approved
by
the
park
service.
the
script,
the
narrative
script,
the
first
amendment
problem
which
is
the
very
heart
of
the
service
will
be
subject
to
the
park
service's
approval.
the
schedule
of
service,
the
operation
will
be
tailored
to
the
day
to
day
changing
needs
on
the
mall
so
that
if
something
has
taken
place
at
this
masonian
institute,
the
service
can
be
rerouted
either
to
take
that
into
account
or
move
around
it.
whether
viewed
from
the
standpoint
of
the
public
who
are
the
beneficiaries
of
this
service
or
from
the
standpoint
of
wmatc's
own
regulatory
jurisdiction,
it
makes
no
difference
that
the
secretary
has
decided
to
do
this
service
through
a
private
concessionaire
as
opposed
to
simply
using
his
own
vehicles
and
his
own
personnel,
the
control
element,
the
discharge
of
his
responsibility
elements
are
all
there.
finally,
quite
apart
from
this
of
course
is
the
exclusive
charge
and
control
which
the
secretary
enjoys
over
the
mall.
since
1898,
in
a
statute
not
codified
in
section
8108,
the
exclusive
charge
to
control
has
been
delegated
now
to
the
secretary
of
interior
over
these
areas
and
this
was
made
clear
in
1909,
when
congress
extended
this
charge
to
control
to
the
roads
between
park
areas
and
to
the
sidewalks
adjacent
to
park
areas.
the
public
utilities
commission
and
the
icc
never
were
given
any
statutory
authority
to
regulate
activities
within
this
mall
area.
now,
petitioner's
--
we've
been
met
by
the
point
by
respondents
that
the
puc
in
fact
did
regulate
bus
lines
because
they
certified
an
example,
one
example
was
given
of
a
bus
line
that
went
through
a
various
points
to
the
district
of
columbia
and
went
on
washington
drive
which
is
of
course
is
part
of
the
mall
over
by
the
national
galleria
and
national
art
gallery.
well,
of
course,
this
regulation
was
not
hostile
to
the
secretary.
there
would
be
no
incentive
for
him
as
long
as
he
wanted
to
permit
the
--
as
long
as
he
was
willing
to
permit
the
service
to
be
conducted
on
the
mall
there
and
did
not
exclude
the
vehicles,
there
really
wasn't
worth
anything
for
him
to
do,
was
he
to
go
to
wmatc
and
say
take
that
one
line
out
so
that
your
certificate
will
read
up
to
the
mall
then
we'll
be
silent
about
what
happens
in
the
mall
and
then
extends
beyond
the
mall?
no,
there
is
no
point
to
that.
there
is
no
advantage
to
him.
the
point
is
that
when
there
is
not
conflicting
--
when
there
are
not
conflicting
regulatory
schemes
and
if
the
secretary
is
willing
to
let
the
activity
continue,
there
is
no
reason
for
him
to
interfere.
however,
here
we
have
an
activity
on
the
part
of
a
secretary
himself
through
a
concessionaire
which
he
does
not
want
interference
and
that
i
think
is
the
essential
point,
the
difference
between
the
fact
that
the
puc
might
have
in
the
course
of
regulating
carriers
whose
activities
were
--
could
be
and
were
substantially
outside
the
mall
area,
also,
probably
without
even
thinking
about
it
inserted
the
reference
to
the
traveling
one
block
in
the
mall
area.
the
same
thing
of
course
would
apply
to
taxi
cabs.
we've
seen
the
maps
in
the
back
of
a
taxi
cabs
and
there
is
not
a
big
block
out
there
for
the
rates
to
be
charged
in
the
mall
area
but
what
good
would
that
would
have
done?
i'm
sure
the
secretary
activity
if
he's
going
to
permit
cabs
on
the
mall,
i'm
sure
he's
not
going
to
try
and
prevent
them
from
a
rate
structure
to
be
imposed
by
the
applicable
authority
who
gets
jurisdiction
because
the
activity
is
outside
of
the
mall.
finally,
i'd
like
to
address
myself
to
d.c.
transit's
point
that
its
franchise
gives
it
the
right
to
insist
on
certification.
the
franchise
which
is
set
forth
on
page
36
(a)
at
sect
of
our
brief
towards
the
rear
provides
first
a
grant
of
authority
to
d.c.
transit
to
operate
a
mass
transit
system.
then
in
section
6,
there
is
also
a
grant
to
the
d.c.
transit
the
right
to
operate
special
charter
and
sightseeing
services.
section
3
contains
a
provision
that
no
competitive
street
railway
or
bus
line,
that
is
a
bus
line
for
the
transportation
of
passengers
or
the
character
which
runs
over
a
given
route
on
a
fixed
schedule
should
be
permitted
without
a
--
without
certification
by
wmatc
as
to
its
necessity.
now,
we
interpret
that
to
apply
number
one
only
to
the
regular
route
service
of
d.c.
transit
because
this
in
effect
not
monopoly
but
this
protection
to
be
afforded
to
wmatc
was
meant
to
protect
the
service
which
he
was
being
required
to
render
and
that
is
its
regular
route
service,
not
a
permissive
--
not
a
permissive
service
of
sightseeing.
the
language
competitive
street
railway
line
which
runs
over
a
given
route
on
a
fix
schedule,
if
they
didn't
insert
the
competitive,
maybe
you
could
argue
it
also
protected
the
--
the
sightseeing
service.
and
certainly,
as
the
district
court
found,
this
not
--
this
does
not
compete
at
least
any
significant
way
with
the
regular
route
service.
i
think
it's
rather
hard
to
envision
a
tram
moving
at
less
than
10
miles
an
hour
from
various
points
around
the
mall
as
competing
with
the
regular
route
service
of
d.c.
transit.
but
even
if
section
3
extends
its
protection
to
d.c.
transit's
sightseeing
activities,
we
still
believe
that
it
is
not
applicable
because
it
requires
that
the
service
which
is
being
limited
or
prohibited
itself
must
travel
over
a
given
route
on
a
fix
schedule
and
this
service
being
provided
by
petitioner
will
be
subject
to
change
from
day
to
day
by
the
secretary
to
meet
the
changing
needs
on
the
mall.
also,
it
is
not
within
the
usual
concept
of
what
is
regular
route
service
in
the
meaning
usually
given
to
that
term
in
public
utility
proceedings.
it
says
a
given
route
on
a
fix
schedule,
that
is
language
which
is
meant
to
mean
regular
route
service
as
far
as
we
can
see
it
and
regular
route
service,
the
best
discussion
of
that
i've
seen
is
in
the
case
cited
by
respondent
--
by
respondent
d.c.
transit
in
bingler,
where
the
district
court
pointed
out
that
sightseeing
service
or
tourist
service
even
if
it
went
basically
on
a
relatively
fix
schedule
does
not
come
within
the
concept
of
regular
route
service
unless
it
--
if
there
is
something
significant
added
in
addition
to
the
expeditious
transportation
between
points.
in
our
case,
we
don't
even
have
expeditious
transportation
between
points,
its
going
to
too
slow
and
we
have
the
something
substantial
added
in
the
sense
that
the
interpretive
service
which
is
certainly
within
that
concept
of
something
substantial
added,
that's
the
reason
why
people
would
be
taking
the
service
is
--
is
present
in
this
case.
therefore,
we
can
see
that
d.c.
transit's
independent
argument
has
no
merit.
for
the
reasons
which
we
have
advanced,
we
believe
the
court
and
respectfully
request
the
court
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
or
remand
the
case
for
the
direction
that
the
complaints
be
dismissed.
thank
you.
