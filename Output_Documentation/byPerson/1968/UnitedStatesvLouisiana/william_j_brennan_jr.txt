justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
just
ask,
mr.
sachse,
in
this
argument,
i
gather
that
line
the
commandant
of
the
coastguard
could
change
tomorrow,
couldn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
ask
may--
does
he
have
power
to
change
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
in
any
event,
that
line
is
frozen
as
of
the
time
of
the--
for
the--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
still
relied
primarily
on
the
argument
that
mr.
sachse
made
yesterday?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
only
if
we
decide
that
that
argument
can't
prevail
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
is
that
one,
mr.
cox?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
yes.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
is
that
line
on
the
top
of
the
green
area
mr.
cox,
is
that
the
coastguard
line?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
just
so
i'm
clear
again
mr.
cox,
if
that
position
does
not
prevail
then
what
we're
concerned
with
there
only
those
white
segments
inside
the
heavy
blue
line.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
chart,
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
would
come
within
the
accept
of
article
iii
if
one
had
been
drawn
according
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
i
understand
it
if
--
if
you
understand
it,
louisiana
relies
on
for
it's
only
in
the
suggestion
that
the
coastguard
line
is
base
--
straight
baseline?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
cox.
if
you
don't
mind
to
interrupt
that
argument,
it's
a
new
one
i
know
but
i
noticed
that
section
6
of
article
4
says,
the
coastal
state
must
clearly
indicate
straight
baselines
on
charts
to
which
due
publicity
must
be
given.
how
is
that
to
be
read?
does
that
mean
if
there
is
a
line
it
must
be
stated
by
the
state
that
it
is
a
straight
baseline?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
not
that
that
we
are
claiming
that
--
we
are
drawing
this
line
as
a
straight
baseline?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
mr.
cox,
did
louisiana
argue
that
at
least
to
the
extent
that
what
is
exercise
of
national
sovereignty
is
involved
here
surely
the
drawing
of
the
coastguard
represents
such
--
wasn't
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
why
wouldn't
--
we
will
require
you
to
follow,
is
that
a
self-assertion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
be
a
harbor
at
either
place
without
the
dredge?
would
there
be
a
harbor
at
either
place
without
the
dredge
channel?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
take
it
they
were
built
to
make
possible
in
each
instance
a
harbor
at
the
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
to
the
extent
as
the
harbour
system
at
all,
it
surely
an
integral
part
of
it,
aren't
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
seem
to
have
about
23
questions.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
want
us
to
cite
all
of
them?
