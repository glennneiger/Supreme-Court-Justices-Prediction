mr.
jp
miller
may
it
please
the
court.
in
addition
to
our
motion
which
litigant
filed
asserting
the
inland
waterline
as
a
coastline,
we
filed
an
alternative
motion
asserting
an
alternative
coastline
under
the
geneva
convention.
if
the
inland
waterline
is
adopted,
of
course
the
alternative
motion
would
become
moot.
for
the
convenience
of
the
court,
we
have
filed
these
folders
which
we
hope
will
assist
you
in
following
us
along
the
coast.
within
the
time
allotted,
it
will
not
be
possible
to
cover
every
segment
of
this
coastline
and
our
failure
to
do
so
should
not
be
considered
as
an
advantage.
as
mr.
sachse
pointed
out,
in
the
california
case
this
court
adopted
the
geneva
convention
for
the
submerged
lands
act.
it
did
not,
however,
permit
california
to
use
the
system
of
straight
baselines
because
the
tort
court
found
that
it
would
extend
our
traditional--
our
boundaries
beyond
their
traditional
limits.
consequently,
louisiana
has
not
used
this
system
of
straight
baselines.
we
do
feel,
however,
that
our
coast
for
these
islands
and
shallow
waters
is
an
ideal
place
for
that
system
to
be
used.
as
a
result
of
not
using
this
system,
those--
we
and
the
government
have
had
considerable
difficulty
in
feeding
our
coast
into
the
remaining
sections
of
the
geneva
convention,
and
we
have
disagreed
completely
over
the
proper
interpretation
of
that
act.
louisiana
feels
that
the
convention
should
be
interpreted
literally,
and
i
have
to
stop,
your
honor,
i
have
a
red
light.
