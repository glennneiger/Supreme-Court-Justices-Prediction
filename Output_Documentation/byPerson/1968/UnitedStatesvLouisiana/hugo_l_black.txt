mr.
miller,
i
wonder
if
it
would
disturb
you,
can
i
ask
you
two
questions
if
you
could
answer
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
may
not
be
able
to
answer
briefly
because
i
notice
according
to
the
government's
brief
there
must
be
about
27
different
issues
here.
but
i
was
wondering
if
you
could
tell
us
number
one,
in
a
very
few
brief
word
what
your
litigation
is
about?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
secondly,
to
what
extent
are
you
relying
on
my
vain
protest
in
the
circuit
california
case
to
sustain
your
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
very
different
from
the
dissent
i
found
in
the
circuit
california
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
take
it
would
not
limit
it
that
your
part
of
the
argument
in
reference
to
the
issue.
what
i
meant
was
if
there's
rest
primarily
on
argument
which
is
practically
the
same
that
i
made
in
california
case.
justice
hugo
l.
black
would
you
repeat
that
when
you
say,
the
government
said
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
it
is
prohibitive?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
about,
how
much
difference
that
make
in
the
amount
of
land
the
government
claims
and
the
amount
that
louisiana's
claims
the
difference
between
your
claim?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
government
claim
that
the
convention
changed
the
boundary
of
the
country
or
change
the
boundary
of
the
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
what
the
constitution
provides?
justice
hugo
l.
black
as
i
understand,
you're
saying
you
can't
change
it
and
give
it
to
another,
is
there
any
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
government's
claim
rested
on
in
interpretation
of
the
submerged
land
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
merely
on
the
treaty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
i
understand
your
argument
to
the
foreign
states
that
government
is
without
constitutional
power
to
confer
to
any
other
nation
or
to
all
the
nations
as
part
of
the
high
seas,
any
submerged
land
that
have
once
been
considered
as
belonging
to
the
government?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
the
boundary
is
the
same,
their
ownership
would
be
the
same
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice
overlap)
the
government
without
constitutional
power
to
convey
any
of
the
first
three
miles
that
you
say
is
inland
of
the
submerged
land?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
assume
that
the
state
has
always
owned
the
three
miles
from
the
coastal
line
so
that
the
government
could
not
have
been
decide?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
done
under
the
statute?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
it
define
what
the
subject
was?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
is
that
statute
published,
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
published
any
way
in
your
brief
or
the
government's
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
your
argument
is
that
that
is
the
line
that
encloses
the
inland
waters?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
and
not
the
treaty
control
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
not
the
treaty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
the
rule
of
the
united
states?
we've
had
fishing
laws,
shrimping
laws,
and
oyster
laws.
all
types
of
conservation
laws
and
the
department
of
wildlife
and
fisheries
have
regularly
patrolled
these
bays.
it's
one
of
the
best
fishing
bays
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
because
of
the
mississippi
river
occurred
the
sediment
and
the
fish
just
flock
in
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
there
ever
been
any
complete
line
or
coastline
drawn
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
draw
it
then?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
it
drawn
under
the
fifth
of
1895
statute
under
those
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
imposed
to
anyone?
that
controlled
that
even
then
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
does
that
mean?
section
2.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
isn't
that
binding?
justice
hugo
l.
black
purpose
of
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
just
rules?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
was
to
mark
the
boundary
between
the
inland
waters
and
the
sea?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
--
i
don't
quite
understand
why
that
is
not
a
line.
justice
hugo
l.
black
navigation?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
why
would
it
mark
a
boundary
that's
not
the
right
boundary?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
sorry.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
alright
you
can
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
what
was
this
line?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
do
you
see
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
same
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
part
is
it
he
makes
the
statement
to
which
you
just
referred?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
that
page
34?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
first
one
in
your
brief?
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
before
or
after
the
act?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
was
the
secretary
of
state?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
is
that
strange?
justice
hugo

black
doesn't
the
government
have
to
act
through
somebody?
justice
hugo
l.
black
secretary
of
treasury
has
the
coastguard
under
his
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
don't
we,
didn't
they
do
it
with
reference
to
the
45-mile
limit
and
with
reference
to
the
cut
in
the
west?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(voice

during
the
truman
time,
he
has
said
a
proclamation
on
some.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
interfere
with
it,
didn't
it
or
that
have
been
reform
if
is
asserting
the
authority
over
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
are
fixing
and
not
in
the
international
aspect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
reference
to
the
domestic
aspect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
so
what's
the
boundary
of
the
country?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
final
analysis,
it
depends
on
the
force
that
a
government
can
exercise
to
fix
its
own
boundary,
doesn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
by
the
way,
it
shall
only
be
executive
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
he
done
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
whatever
the
purpose
was
has
he
outlined
any
straight
line?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
that
you
were
saying
that
this
area
inside
the
coast
goes
to
louisiana?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
anything
in
the
beginning
of
that
about
what
its
purpose
is?
justice
hugo
l.
black
have
any
lines
on
this?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
say
for
years
there
had
been
charts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
say
for
years
there
have
been
large
charts?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
it
your
argument
that
you
are
--
those
charts
fall
within
the
requirements
of
article
3
that
says
along
the
coast
as
marked
on
