mr.
j.
b.
miller
i
hope
not,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
i'll
answer
the
first
question
your
honor.
as
you
know
this
court
held
in
the
first
louisiana
case
that
louisiana
owned
none
of
the
marginal
sea
that
our
title
stopped
at
the
inland
water
--
at
the
inland
waters
that
we
own
the
inland
waters
under
the
doctrine
of
pollard
versus
hagan,
and
pollard
versus
hagan
was
in
that
case
and
in
the
california
case
limited
to
inland
waters
with
the
result
we
owned
nothing
beyond
inland
waters
none
of
the
territorial
sea.
following
that,
congress
passed
his
submerged
land
act
by
which
they
confirmed
and
granted
to
the
states
a
three-mile
belt
of
marginal
sea
lying
outside
of
its
inland
waters.
the
--
it
not
only
confirmed
the
grant
to
the
three-mile
belt
but
in
cases
where
the
state's
boundary,
historic
boundary
extended
beyond
three
miles
it
confirmed
it
out
to
its
historic
boundary.
the
second
louisiana
case
held
that
we
did
not
have
a
historic
boundary
extending
three
leagues
that
we
had
contended.
although,
this
court
held
and
the
government
conceded
in
that
case
that
we
did
on
the
islands
within
three
leagues
of
the
coast
and
that
we
also
owned
the
water
between
those
islands
and
the
shore
because
they
were
so
situated
as
to
enclose
inland
waters.
now,
this
case
is
to
determine
where
the
limit
of
the
inland
waters
of
louisiana
are,
the
inland
waters
that
belong
to
this
state
under
pollard
versus
hagan.
and
once
we
determine
where
the
inland
waters
are,
then
we
measure
three
miles
outside
of
those
inland
waters
for
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
your
honor,
we
have
felt
that
we
must
accept
the
california
case
in
holding
that
the
geneva
convention
applies.
we
may
not
agree
with
that
but
that
was
the
holding
of
this
court.
now,
if
you
will
remember
this
case
--
this
court
in
the
texas
case
and
in
the
florida
case
awarded
both
texas
and
florida
their
historic
limits,
texas
goes
out
three
leagues,
florida
goes
out
three
leagues
but
alabama,
mississippi
and
louisiana
were
brought
into
their
shores
into
their
inland
water.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes
sir,
but
the
inland
water
land
mr.
sachse
argued
yesterday
is
the
limit
of
our
inland
waters.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
historic
boundaries.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no
sir,
i
did
not
say
that
we
conceded
that.
i
said
that
for
the
purposes
of
our
alternative
coastline
i
want
to
argue
(voice
overlap)
we
have
assumed
that
this
court
will
follow.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
absolutely.
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
nothing
that
i
say
should
be
construed
in
any
manner
as
detracting
from
a
primary
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
we
filed
an
alternative
motion
asserting
an
alternative
coastline
primarily
in
our
position
of
the
restrictive
and
narrow
interpretation
of
this
convention
that
the
justice
department
put
on
it.
they
have
come
up
with
a
line
for
louisiana's
inland
waters
that's
virtually
a
shoreline.
and
it's
my
purpose
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
even
--
that
whether
or
not
you
accept
the
inland
water
lines
and
mr.
sachse
advocates
there's
no
justification
for
the
line
that
the
government
continues.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes
sir,
to
a
great
extent
mr.
justice
to
great
extent.
we
feel
that
the
shores
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
particularly
louisiana
are
so
shallow,
there's
so
changing.
there's
no
way
the
foreign
commerce
or
any
ocean
going
commerce
to
go
anywhere
in
louisiana
because
of
the
shallow
waters.
we've
had
the
dredged
channel,
the
united
states
government
spent
over
$300
million
dredging
channels
in
to
the
ports
of
louisiana.
there
could
be
no
commerce,
they
would
be
no
port
but
for
these
dredged
channels,
this
is
a
gently
sloping
shore,
it
is
of
no
value
at
all
to
foreign
commerce.
and
we
feel
that
these
are
factors
that
this
court
must
take
into
consideration
in
determining
what
are
the
inland
waters
of
louisiana
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
now,
i
have
already
alluded
to
the
disagreement
between
the
government
and
i
say
that
was
the
interpretation
of
the
convention.
louisiana
takes
the
position
that
the
convention
is
a
general
document
that
it
could
not
possibly
be
held
to
cover
every
complexity
and
every
detail
of
every
coast
in
the
world.
we
think
it's
like
the
united
states
constitution
and
that
--
it
must
be
interpreted
liberally
in
order
to
make
it
work.
the
government
on
the
other
hand
said
we've
got
to
stick
to
the
letter
of
that
document
that
we
can't
go
beyond
its
four
corners
and
where
it
silent
it
is
prohibitive.
it
denies
to
us
principles
of
international
law
that
are
well
established.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
that
where
the
convention
is
silent
it
is
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
--
it
is
prohibitive.
for
example,
the
convention
is
silent
on
whether
or
not
islands
may
be
used
to
form
that
perimeter
of
bays
or
to
enclose
inland
waters.
the
government
takes
the
fact
position
that
that
means
it
is
prohibitive
that
we
may
not
use
islands
to
enclose
inland
waters.
yet,
in
every
single
instance
of
every
bay
that
they
have
recognized
along
our
coast
they
do
in
fact
used
islands
to
form
the
perimeters
of
those
bays.
as
a
result
of
this
type
of
narrow
interpretation
of
this
convention,
the
government
has
arrived
of
what
we
consider
as
shoreline.
it
has
changed
the
status
of
the
inland
waters
of
louisiana
from
inland
to
the
high
seas.
it's
changed
the
status
of
the
inland
waters
which
have
been
recognized
by
this
court
to
be
inland.
a
typical
example
of
this
is
in
chandeleur
and
breton
islands.
these
waters
are
enclosed
by
the
chandeleur
island
and
by
breton
island.
the
government
concedes
--
now,
listen
to
this,
the
government
concedes
that
these
waters
are
inland
but
they
say
that
they're
inland
only
because
of
the
concessions
they
made
in
this
prior
case
where
they
admitted
and
conceded
when
we
were
arguing
for
a
three-league
limit.
they
admitted
that
all
of
the
island
within
three
leagues
with
the
territory
of
louisiana
and
that
all
of
the
waters
between
the
islands
and
the
mainland
was
so
situated
as
to
enclose
inland
waters.
this
court
recognized
this
in
the
first
louisiana
case
and
pointed
out
that
these
waters
had
become
vested
in
louisiana
at
the
time
it
was
admitted
into
the
union
and
our
territory
under
the
adoption
of
pollard
versus
hagan.
in
the
california
case,
this
court
again
recognized
that
these
waters
were
inland.
it
distinguished
them
from
the
santa
barbara
channel
which
the
court
had
held
connected
two
areas
of
the
open
sea.
in
distinguishing
these
waters
from
the
santa
barbara
channel,
it
pointed
out
that
breton
island
was
a
cul-de-sac
that
chandeleur
island
led
only
to
breton
island
if
it
led
anywhere
that
neither
served
as
a
route
of
passage
between
two
areas
of
the
open
sea
and
both
was
so
shallow
as
to
be
navigable.
now,
the
government
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
your
honor,
where
is
the
mainland
(voice
overlap).
these
are
all
islands.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
this
is
mississippi.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
this
is
the
mass
of
islands
that
goes
to
the
main.
this
is
city
of
new
orleans,
right
here.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
all
of
louisiana's
shoreline
is
out.
this
is
what
makes
it
so
difficult
to
apply
this
convention
without
the
use
of
a
straight
baseline
system.
now,
these
waters
have
been
phrased
not
only
that
it
recognized
in
the
phrase
of
louisiana
case
and
in
the
california
case.
they
have
been
recognized
as
inland
waters
of
louisiana
in
case
in
1905
before
this
court
involving
a
boundary
dispute
between
louisiana
and
mississippi.
even
that
chapman
line
which
the
secretary
of
interior
chapman
drew
in
1950
as
the
most
landward
position
the
government
could
claim
in
these
waters
recognized
that
these
were
inland
and
enclosed
the
water
outside
the
chandeleur
islands.
they
were
again
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
supplemental
decree
in
1965
because
we
were
awarded
title
to
waters
line
outside
of
breton
island.
but
now,
the
government
says,
the
convention
has
changed
all
of
it
that
there's
now
no
legal
basis
for
holding
these
waters
to
be
inland
that
the
convention
is
reclassified
them
into
the
high
seas.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
in
this
particular
area,
your
honor?
mr.
j.
b.
miller
it's
about
15
miles
between
these
islands
and
these
islands.
the
government
says
that
the
convention
means
that
we
only
get
a
three-mile
belt
around
each
island.
so,
there
would
be
a
strip
of
high
seas
in
there.
but
the
government
doesn't
withdraw
its
concession.
it
does
not
withdraw
its
concession
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
in
this
particular
water,
it
does
not
withdraw
its
concession.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
it
applies
its
--
it
withdraws
in
anywhere
else.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
but
it
says
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
that's
right.
it
says,
except
for
its
concession
in
this
particular
instance
these
waters
would
be
high
seas
that
the
convention
has
changed
the
status
from
inland
waters
to
high
seas.
now,
we
say
that
congress
never
intended
any
such
results.
we
say
that
the
congressional
hearings
and
the
hearings
before
the
committee
on
their
adoption
of
a
geneva
convention,
the
committee
asked
the
state
department
this
very
question.
are
there
any
waters
which
are
now
entitled
but
which
would
become
high
seas
if
we
adopted
this
convention.
and
the
state
department's
answer
was
in
the
negative.
now,
we
say
that
the
convention
has
not
changed
these
waters
that
the
convention
should
be
interpreted
liberally
and
it
should
be
interpreted
so
as
to
continue
the
principles
of
international
law
which
were
in
existence
prior
to
the
convention
and
which
are
not
conferred
to
the
convention.
but
if
we're
wrong
and
if
the
government
is
right
and
if
the
convention
should
be
interpreted
as
to
change
the
status
of
inland
waters
from
inland
to
the
high
seas
then
we
say
that
these
waters
must
be
recognized
as
historic
waters
which
are
accepted
from
the
convention.
the
convention
expressly
accepts
the
category
of
historic
waters.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
if
the
government
contends
that
the
convention
changed
the
status
of
inland
waters
and
the
government
contends
that
the
convention
changed
the
boundary
of
this
country
and
took
away
the
territory
of
louisiana
and
we
say
that
if
that's
true
and
we
don't
think
it
is
but
if
that's
true,
then
we
say
that
the
act
of
congress
adopt
in
this
convention
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
because
congress
may
not
divest
the
state
of
its
sovereign
territory.
it
may
not
see
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
your
honor,
the
constitution
provides,
i
believe,
in
article
iv
that
congress
may
not
take
away
the
part
of
one
state
to
form
another
state
and
that
it
may
not
add
territory
to
the
first
state
without
its
consent.
the
second
article
provides
that
the
power
of
congress
to
seed
and
sell
its
own
property,
its
own
territory
is
an
incumbent.
the
cases
have
held
under
this
that
congress
may
not
change
the
boundaries
of
a
state
without
that
state's
consent.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
there
is
no
expressed
provision
in
the
constitution
saying
that
congress
may
not
take
away
the
territory
of
a
state
and
give
it
to
a
foreign
nation.
but,
we
say
that
if
it
can't
take
away
the
territory
of
a
state
and
give
it
to
another
state,
it
must
follow
that
it
can't
give
it
to
the
family
of
nations.
and
cases
have
so
held
in
the
california
case,
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
that
the
contraction
of
a
state's
boundary
in
the
name
of
foreign
relations
would
be
highly
questionable
and
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
several
cases
in
which
the
courts
have
held
that
congress
may
not
contract
the
state's
boundary
or
cede
its
territory
without
the
consent
of
that
state.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no,
sir.
the
government
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
government's
contention
as
i
understand
it
is
that
by
virtue
of
the
adoption
of
the
treaty
that
there
is
now
no
legal
basis
for
these
waters
remaining
inland
waters
but
since
they
have
conceded
that
they
were
inland
waters
in
the
earlier
case
that
they
do
not
deal
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
withdraw
that
concession.
now,
a
similar
situation
exists
in
the
mississippi
river
delta.
your
map
number
five
will
portray
this
area.
louisiana's
alternative
coastline
is
shown
in
solid
green
and
its
three-mile
limit
is
shown
in
dusked
green
lines.
the
government's
coastline
the
more
restrictive
one
is
shown
in
solid
brown
where
there
are
no
brown
lines
the
government
uses
the
shore
as
the
line.
the
government's
three-mile
limit
is
shown
in
dusked
brown.
now,
we
all
know
of
the
importance
of
the
mississippi
river.
this
river
extends
not
only
through
louisiana,
it
goes
all
the
way
to
the
ohio
and
the
midwest
and
the
missouri
and
the
west.
this
is
a
river
that
was
responsible
for
the
louisiana
purchase.
it
participated
in
the
war
of
1812
and
other
wars.
it's
the
most
important
waterway
in
this
country.
now,
it
is
inland
water.
could
the
government
cede
the
mississippi
river
to
the
foreign
--
to
the
family
of
foreign
nations
and
say
this
is
high
seas
just
by
doctrine
of
treaty?
certainly
not,
the
treaty
making
power
of
congress
is
limited
to
the
constitutional
power
granted
congress.
the
government
concedes
that
most
of
these
waters
are
geographical
--
geographic
inland
waters.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
that
means
that
under
the
convention,
they
qualify
mathematically
as
a
bay.
for
example,
they
say
that
west
bay
in
going
to
island
bay
qualify
as
bays
geographically
under
the
mathematical
formulas
of
the
convention.
louisiana
cites
that
all
of
these
waters
are
inland
waters
both
historically
and
geographically.
and
while
the
government
concedes
that
most
of
them
do
the
major
exception
is
east
bay.
they
say
that
east
bay
is
high
seas.
now,
east
bay
is
the
most
important
bay
in
this
delta
area.
all
of
this
area
was
formed
by
sediment.
it's
continuing
to
deposit
sediment.
this
passage
are
changing,
some
of
them
being
extended
seaward
others
are
regressive
it's
an
ever
changing
area.
but
going
back
to
east
bay,
the
government
says
that
east
bay
is
high
seas
because
it
does
not
qualify
under
article
7
of
the
convention.
now,
article
7
defines
a
bay
as
a
well-marked
indentation
whose
depth
of
penetration
is
sufficient
to
enclose
waters,
east
bay
meets
that
test,
it
obviously
has
no
mere
curvature
of
the
coast.
another
requirement
is
that
the
width
of
the
bay
may
not
exceed
24
miles.
east
bay
is
only
15
miles.
but
article
7
also
requires
that
the
area
of
the
bay
must
be
at
least
equal
to
the
area
of
a
semicircle,
the
diameter
of
which
is
a
closing
line
of
the
bay.
since
east
bay
does
not
meet
this
test
in
it
entirety,
the
government
says,
no
bay
its
high
seas.
we
do
point
out
at
this
point
however
that
a
substantial
portion
of
east
bay
does
meet
the
semicircle
test
and
this
map
shows
a
red
line
which
satisfy
the
semicircle
test
and
the
convention
in
every
respect.
the
government
even
denies
it.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no
your
honor.
we
think
that
this
case
can
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
this
record.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
go
into
a
lot
of
detail
about
selection
of
headlines
and
whether
we
should
select
the
point
here
that's
200
feet
from
a
point
there.
but
there
are
principles
that
are
involved
in
this
case
that
i
think
this
court
must
decide
even
before
a
mass
that
could
start
on
this
case.
and
the
one
principle
that
i've
mentioned
before
is
what
about
the
inland
waters
that
qualified
as
inland
waters
and
form
part
of
the
sovereign
territory
of
louisiana
before
the
adoption
of
this
convention.
a
master
could
not
start
on
this
case
without
the
answer
to
that
question.
there
aren't
really
any
substantial
factual
disputes
in
this
case
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
your
honor,
we
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
--
in
this
alternative
argument
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
i
think
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
i
think
i
can
clear
that
for
your
honor
right
now.
we
do
not
depart
from
the
convention.
we
say
that
government's
interpretation
of
the
convention
is
wrong
and
but
that
if
you
do
follow
the
government's
interpretation
then
you
must
hold
the
convention
to
be
constitutional.
we
interpret
the
convention
so
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes
sir,
if
you
adopt
the
government's
interpretation
of
it.
if
you
adopt
our
interpretation
of
it
you
do
not.
article
7
accepts
the
category
of
historic
bays
from
this
mathematical
formula.
it
is
our
position
that
if
a
body
of
water
has
qualified
its
inland
waters
throughout
the
history
of
this
country
if
it
has
been
the
inland
waters
and
territory
of
a
state
throughout
the
history
of
this
country
then
it
is
historic
inland
waters
and
it
is
accepted
from
the
mathematical
requirements
of
this
brand
new
semicircle
test.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no,
your
honor
historic
bays
are
accepted
in
the
convention
itself.
article
7
of
the
convention
provides
that
the
foregoing
provision
shall
not
apply
to
so-called
historic
bays.
we
say
these
are
historic
bays.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
the
government
says
they
are
historic
bays
that
they
are
no
longer
inland
waters
and
that
they
are
high
seas.
we
say
if
that
is
a
proper
interpretation
of
this
convention
then
the
convention
must
be
unconstitutional.
but
we
don't
think
it's
unconstitutional.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
in
east
bay,
that
is
true,
yes
sir.
now,
louisiana
claims
east
bay
as
historic
waters
not
only
in
the
legal
sense
that
we've
just
been
talking
about
as
having
qualified
as
inland
waters
previously
but
also
in
the
historical
sense
of
exercise
of
sovereignty.
at
the
time
of
the
louisiana
purchase
in
1803
and
when
louisiana
was
admitted
to
the
union
in
1812
there
was
no
mathematical
requirement
for
a
bay.
there
was
no
limitation
upon
the
closing
line.
the
only
requirement
was
that
the
bay
have
the
general
configuration
and
characteristics
of
a
bay
and
that
its
depth
of
penetration
be
such
as
to
enclose
inland
waters
along
each
sides.
certainly,
east
bay
met
this
test
and
this
map
of
1838
shows
a
configuration
of
east
bay
at
that
time.
earlier
maps
show
the
same
general
configuration
and
we
can
assume
that
this
was
a
configuration
in
1812.
it's
obvious
that
its
depth
of
penetration
was
sufficient
to
enclose
inland
waters
and
it
therefore
qualified
as
the
inland
waters
for
the
state
of
louisiana
when
it
was
admitted
to
the
union
and
became
part
of
a
territory
of
this
state
under
adoption
of
pollard
versus
hagan.
not
only
is
this
true
but
louisiana's
act
of
admission,
its
act
of
admission
includes
all
of
its
inland
waters.
it
was
described
as
being
bounded
on
the
south
by
the
gulf
of
mexico
not
the
shore
but
the
gulf
of
mexico.
mr.

your
honor,
unfortunately,
it
did
not
appear
in
the
appendix,
it
is
--
i
mean
in

to
the

it
is
in
our
appendices

the
brief

mr.

i
don't
think
they
have
the
entire
convention.

section

of

is
the
one
to
which
i
refer.
mr.
j.

this
--
no
sir,
i'm
sure
they
left
it
out.
but
this
small
appendix
to
our
brief
is
the
one
that
contends.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
on
page
--
it
starts
on
127,
the
article
the
i
referred
to
is
number
6
on
page
130.
it
says
before
going
--
after
going
through
all
the
mathematical
test
of
bays,
it
says,
“the
foregoing
provision
shall
not
apply
to
so-called
historic
bays
or
in
any
case
where
the
straight
baseline
system
is
used.”
now,
going
back
to
louisiana's
boundaries,
each
boundary
was
a
gulf
of
mexico
since
east
bay
was
inland
waters
it
was
obviously
not
the
gulf
of
mexico,
it
became
the
territory
of
this
state
in
1812
and
remains
the
territory
of
this
state
under
the
doctrine
of
pollard
versus
hagan.
now,
towards
the
turn
of
the
century,
international
law
had
begun
to
develop
a
limitation
upon
closing
lines.
and
the
10-mile
closing
line
was
mentioned
with
increasing
frequency
and
several
countries
had
adopted
it.
this
chart
shows
that
east
bay
in
1895
more
than
adequately
satisfied
even
the
10-mile
lines.
this
map
also
shows
another
interesting
factor.
grande
pass
is
a
peninsula
in
east
bay
when
the
united
states
government
started
the
improvement
of
navigation
at
south
pass.
this
grande
pass
was
dammed
off
to
force
more
water
through
south
pass.
as
a
result
of
this
procedure,
the
sediment
flow
in
the
east
bay
was
curtailed.
grande
pass
subsided
and
eventually
disappeared.
the
1922
coast
chart
shows
this.
it
shows
east
bay
after
this
occurrence.
the
passes
at
south
and
southwest
pass
had
continued
to
go
forward
but
grande
pass
had
disappeared.
east
bay
had
a
greater
penetration
than
depth
of
penetration
than
ever
before
but
for
the
first
time
its
entrance
exceeded
10
miles.
at
that
time,
international
law
said,
you
draw
a
10-mile
line
at
the
close
--
at
the
nearest
point
within
the
bay
which
does
not
exceed
10-miles.
south
pass
and
southwest
pass
have
continued
to
grow,
they're
still
growing.
in
1958,
when
the
convention
was
adopted
this
was
a
configuration
of
east
bay.
it
was
still
a
bay.
it
still
had
the
sufficient
depth
of
penetration
to
be
a
bay.
it
is
long
since
then
and
the
next
map
shows
the
1968
depth
of
penetration
and
width
at
the
bay.
now,
the
government
says
that
the
10-mile
rule
never
became
international
law.
we
don't
know,
but
we
say
this
that
if
it
never
became
international
law
then
there
was
no
limitation
and
east
bay
remain
the
bay
and
inland
waters
of
this
state
by
virtue
of
its
general
configuration
and
characteristics
as
a
bay.
it
certainly
had
sufficient
depth
of
penetration.
now,
we've
shown
that
east
bay
has
been
part
of
a
territory
of
this
state
since
the
beginning,
since
1812.
we
say
that
the
convention
cannot
now
divest
louisiana
of
this
territory
without
the
convention
being
unconstitutional.
since
the
time
of
historic
bays
is
accepted
from
the
strict,
inflexible
mathematical
requirements
that
will
inject
international
law
in
1958,
we
say
that
east
bay
is
a
historic
bay
by
virtue
of
having
always
qualified
as
a
bay
throughout
the
history
of
this
country
and
that
congress
has
no
power
to
do
otherwise.
it
has
no
more
power
to
disclaim
title
to
east
bay
than
it
does
in
mississippi
river
or
the
district
of
columbia.
but
east
bay
had
not
owned
a
qualified
geographically
as
a
bay.
the
classic
definition
under
international
law
of
historic
water
is
waters
over
which
a
nation
has
exercised
sovereignty
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
with
an
attitude
of
general
toleration
among
foreign
states.
now,
the
government
says
we've
exercised
no
sovereignty
but
it
confuses
ownership
with
sovereignty.
it
seems
to
imply
that
the
united
states
must
have
openly
and
expressly
asserted
a
clean
that
east
bay
was
a
part
of
the
territory
of
this
nation.
this
is
not
necessary,
sovereignty
does
not
mean
ownership.
sovereignty
is
authority,
it's
the
exercise
of
power
or
control;
it's
less
than
complete
territoriality.
this
is
made
clear
that
the
1962
study
of
the
united
nations
which
we
understand
the
government
has
adopted
in
the
alaska
case
but
it's
not
necessary
for
this
classic
type
of
definition
of
historic
waters
that
all
conceivable
acts
of
sovereignty
be
exercised.
it's
only
necessary
that
a
nation
exercise
some
act
of
sovereignty
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
concept
of
high
seas.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no,
sir.
the
convention
is
silent
on
the
definition
of
historic
waters
and
it's
our
contention
that
that
time
was
accepted
from
these
mathematical
requirements
to
serve
as
a
safety
valve
for
the
various
situations
we're
talking
about
as
well
as
other
situations.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
that's
the
only
time
it's
even
mentioned
your
honor.
there
is
no
definition
in
the
convention.
now,
the
definition
that
is
recommended
by
the
united
nation
is
the
classic
definition
that
i'm
talking
about
now,
it's
the
exercise
of
sovereignty
and
that
means
that
a
nation
has
exercised
some
sovereignty
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
that's
the
best
time
they
could
come
up
with
was
the
word
“considerable”
with
the
general
attitude
of
toleration
by
foreign
nations.
but
it's
not
necessary
that
all
acts
of
sovereignty
be
exercise
only
and
necessary
that
there
will
be
--
the
exercise
of
some
act
of
sovereignty
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
concept
of
high
seas.
in
the
norwegian
fisheries
case
which
held
norway's
waters
to
be
historic
behind
their
baselines,
the
only
claim
that
norway
ever
made
was
the
fishing.
they
claim
fishing
rights
and
by
virtue
of
those
rights
having
been
asserted
for
so
long
of
time
and
the
lines
having
been
drawn,
they
were
held
to
be
historic
borders.
now,
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
concept
of
high
seas
to
exercise
limited
control
which
is
permitted
by
the
convention
within
the
contiguous
zone.
as
for
example
the
--
to
prevent
the
infringement
of
your
custom
laws,
the
infringement
of
your
immigration
laws
or
your
sanitary
laws,
there
is
a
fringe
around
the
territorial
sea
and
which
you
may
exercise
limited
control
to
prevent
violation
of
a
nation's
laws
with
in
its
own
territorial
sea.
but
we're
not
talking
about
that
here.
we're
talking
about
the
freedom
of
the
seas
and
the
freedom
of
the
seas
is
where
a
nation
may
not
exercise
sovereignty
unless
its
claim
in
these
waters
as
its
own
and
the
freedom
of
the
high
seas
which
are
set
forth
in
the
convention
on
the
high
seas
or
freedom
of
navigation,
freedom
of
fishing,
freedom
of
flight,
and
freedom
to
lay
pipe
lines.
if
sovereignty
is
exercised
in
any
one
of
these
theories
it's
absolutely
inconsistent
with
the
concept
of
high
seas
and
can
be
justified
only
on
a
basis
that
the
nation
is
claiming
the
waters
as
its
very
own.
now,
we
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
not
quite,
your
honor.
not
quite,
i
think
that
the
government
may
do
whatever
it
wishes
with
its
own
territory
but
i
say
that
the
united
states
government
may
not
convey
to
a
foreign
state
any
part
of
the
sovereign
territory
of
a
state.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no
sir,
the
boundaries
of
the
states
under
the
california
and
louisiana
cases
stops
at
the
inland
waters.
the
boundary
of
a
nation
extends
for
three
miles
beyond
that.
that's
our
present
claim,
three
miles.
russia
claims
12
miles
and
the
one
thing
that
could
never
be
agreed
upon
on
this
convention
was
how
many
miles
could
a
nation
claim.
this
contention
is
silent.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
i
would
have
to
presume
that
if
congress
and
the
president
so
chose
that
they
could
do
it
as
well
as
it
did
not
infringed
upon
the
boundary
of
a
state.
i
think
it
would
be
a
disaster
to
do
it
but
i
think
that
this
i
have
to
admit
that
this
power
has
vested
in
commerce.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no,
sir.
this
court
held
in
the
first
louisiana
case
that
louisiana
did
not
own
any
of
the
three-mile
limit
that
we
stopped
at
our
inland
waters.
now,
if
you
look
at
this
next
map,
--
if
you
look
at
your
map
number
5,
you
will
see
that
there
is
a
three-mile
limit
beyond
our
inland
waters.
the
boundary
of
louisiana
stops
at
the
inland
waters.
but
the
submerged
land
act
--
the
boundary
of
a
nation
stops
at
the
three-mile
limit.
the
submerged
land
act
has
granted
to
louisiana
the
re
sources
under
the
three-mile
belt
but
i
cannot
say
that
we
actually
owned
the
water
of
the
three-mile
belt.
but
our
boundaries
are
inland
waters.
now,
we've
discussed
the
classic
definition
of
exercise
of
sovereignty.
we've
shown
that
east
bay
has
qualified
geographically
as
inland
waters
of
this
nation
since
1803
in
the
louisiana
purchase
and
since
then
louisiana
was
admitted
to
the
union
in
1812.
this
fact
alone
presupposes
that
all
kinds
of
sovereignty
were
exercised
all
these
waters.
if
it
formed
part
of
a
territorial
of
this
state
and
this
nation,
there
is
a
presumption
that
sovereignty
was
exercised
over
these
waters.
and
it
is
impossible
at
this
late
date
to
determine
every
single
act
of
sovereignty
that's
been
exercised
by
this
nation,
by
this
state,
by
the
local
authorities
and
everybody
else
but
we
will
mention
some.
now,
mr.
sachse
has
already
discussed
the
act
of
1895
as
a
basis
of
the
inland
water
line.
the
government
has
objected
to
this
and
contends
that
this
act
is
limited
to
navigation
that
it
have
no
effect
whatsoever
but
anything
else
except
navigation.
we
violently
disagree
with
that
interpretation
but
for
the
purposes
of
our
discussion
of
history
of
east
bay,
we
will
assume
that
the
government
is
right
and
that
it
is
limited
to
navigation.
now,
freedom
of
navigation
is
the
first
freedom
mentioned
in
the
convention
on
the
high
seas,
no
nation
may
regulate
navigation
on
any
part
of
the
high
seas.
to
do
so,
it
can
only
justify
it
on
the
basis
that
it
is
claiming
those
waters
as
it's
very
own.
now,
mr.
sachse
has
pointed
ut
that
prior
to
1895,
congress
had
adopted
the
international
rule
for
the
prevention
of
collisions
on
the
sea.
these
rules
applied
not
only
to
the
high
seas,
they
also
applied
to
the
marginal
or
territorial
sea.
subsequent
acts
of
congress,
treaties
and
the
case
of
the
delaware
make
this
clear.
the
international
rules
applied
to
the
high
seas
and
the
territorial
seas.
the
act
of
1895
imposed
the
inland
rules
only
upon
inland
waters.
but
it
imposed
the
inland
rules
upon
all
vessels,
foreign
as
well
as
domestic.
it
says
that
all
vessels
must
comply
with
the
inland
rules
once
they
get
into
the
inland
waters
and
it
authorize
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
designate
and
define
a
line
marking
those
inland
waters
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
that
act.
now,
the
reason
for
the
designation
of
this
line
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
the
reason
for
it
was
of
course
to
regulate
navigation.
but
the
effect
of
it
goes
beyond
that.
it
was
a
line
marking
the
inland
waters
of
this
united
states.
now,
in
1895
immediately
after
the
passing
of
the
statute,
the
secretary
of
treasury
began
his
test
of
designating
and
defining
these
lines.
he
picked
the
most
important
areas
in
the
united
states
for
his
first
lines
in
1895.
he
included
philadelphia
harbor
and
delaware
bay,
baltimore
and
chesapeake
bay,
new
york,
charleston,
savannah,
mobile
and
new
orleans
and
the
delta
of
the
mississippi
river.
among
their
first
lines
designated
in
1895,
there
had
to
be
some
lines
showing
where
our
inland,
the
inland
waters
of
this
nation
were
so
that
we
could
enforce
inland
rules
on
one
side
and
international
rules
on
the
other
side,
and
he
designated
these
lines
in
1895.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes
sir,
an
act
of
congress
of
february
1895
ought
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
it's
obvious.
i
don't
recall
the
title
of
the
statute,
your
honor.
it
did
provide
that
the
inland
rules
what
to
be
used
in
the
inland
waters
of
the
united
states
and
it
did
authorize
and
direct
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
designate
and
define
the
line
--
the
line
dividing
the
inland
waters
from
the
high
seas.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
it
is
in
one
of
these
appendices
to
our
brief,
i
have
the
title,
your
honor.
it's
--
the
title
is
“an
act
to
adopt
special
rules
for
the
navigation
of
harbors
rivers,
--
rivers
and
inland
waters
of
the
united
states
except
the
great
lakes”
supplementary
to
an
act
of
august
19,
1890
entitled
an,
“act
to
adopt
regulation
for
the
preventing
--
for
preventing
collisions
at
sea.”
this
act
was
complementary
to
the
act
of
1890
which
have
adopted
the
international
rules.
this
act
adopts
the
inland
rules.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
i
can't
answer
that
offhand,
your
honor.
we've
got
so
much
in
these
briefs.
do
you
have
it
mr.
cox?
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
that's
exactly
our
position.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
that's
one
of
our
positions.
we
say
that
irrespective
of
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
your
honor,
government
says
east
bay
is
open
seas.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
if
it
is
exercised
within
well-defined
areas
and
marked
and
is
exercised
for
a
sufficient
period
of
time,
the
answer
is
yes.
this
is
exactly
what
happened
in
norway.
norway
had
drawn
these
lines
for
fishing
purposes.
and
there
had
been
no
concept
of
straight
baseline
before
the
convention
and
the
court
held
that
they
will
--
there
were
--
historic
waters
because
norway
had
controlled
fishing
inside
those
lines.
if
we
were
to
draw
off
a
part
of
the
high
seas
and
stationed
gunboats
out
there
in
regulation
and
say
you
can't
come
in
here
unless
you
apply
--
comply
with
our
regulations
and
we
do
it
for
sufficient
period
of
time
without
objection
from
foreign
states
its
historic
waters.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
now,
the
1895
line
around
the
delta
was
defined
as
commencing
at
the
light
--
southeast
pass
jetty
light.
it
ran
thence
to
pass
(inaudible)
and
thence
to
the
(inaudible)
island
in
the
chandeleur
chain.
it
commenced
again
by
separate
description
at
south
pass
east
jetty
light
ran
of
southwest
pass
and
thence
north
to
shore.
this
description
was
published
in
the
treasury
department
circular
127
of
july
1895
and
was
also
indicated
on
the
united
states
coast
chart
194
of
that
year.
and
we
have
circled
this
in
red
and
this
map
appears
in
the
reduced
scale
in
(inaudible).
i'm
sure
you
can't
read
it
but
that's
what
it
says.
now,
this
line
enclosed
all
of
the
waters
of
the
delta
including
east
bay.
similar
lines
were
designated
again
in
1897
and
1900.
after
1900,
the
authority
was
transferred
from
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
labor.
and
in
1905
and
in
1907,
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
labor
designated
similar
lines
making
only
such
adjustments
that
were
occasioned
by
the
seaward
growth
of
the
passes.
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
labor
became
the
secretary
of
commerce.
and
in
1917,
another
line
was
designated
by
the
secretary
of
commerce.
the
lines
were
again
designated
in
1927
and
1932.
our
next
map
shows
a
composite
of
all
of
these
lines
as
well
as
in
1953,
your
honors.
at
the
time
these
lines
were
drawn,
each
and
every
one
of
them
enclosed
the
entirety
of
east
bay.
the
adjustments
in
the
lines
were
occasion
only
by
the
seaward
growth
of
those
passes.
since
1895,
that
bay
has
been
enclosed
as
inland
waters
of
this
country.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
well,
we
--
our
argument
is
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
well,
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
your
honor,
we
say
that
because
of
these
lines
that
this
makes
east
bay
an
historic
bay
which
is
accepted
from
the
treaty.
it
is
accepted
by
its
own
terms
from
the
mathematical
requirements
of
the
treaty
and
we
say
that
these
lines
marked
the
inland
waters
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
when
did?
mr.
j.
b.
miller
1953.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
this
is
the
inland
water
line
that
mr.
sachse
discussed
yesterday.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
not
in
this
area
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
that
is
map
number
15.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
we
take
the
position
that
the
line
of
1953
is
frozen
because
louisiana
has
adopted
a
statute
declaring
as
its
boundary.
now,
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
coastguard
tried
to
change
this
line
last
year.
they
held
hearings
all
over
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
there
were
such
a
furrow,
there
were
so
many
objections
by
the
shipping
interest
and
the
people
who
had
economic
interest
in
this
area
that
they
abandoned
the
whole
project.
we
have
to
have
a
line
like
this
in
louisiana
because
of
shallow
waters,
the
small
boats,
fishermen
who
have
been
out
on
east
bay
and
outboard
motorboat
fishing.
and
the
government
says
this
is
high
seas
in
the
16-foot
motorboat.
we
can't
even
get
to
the
shores
in
louisiana
without
dredged
channels.
there
must
be
a
line
somewhere
out
there.
now,
we
say
that
these
lines
qualify
straight
baselines
under
article
4
of
the
convention
also
because
we
think
to
do
and
we
think
that
the
convention
should
be
interpreted
as
in
including
lines
such
as
these
because
this
is
necessary
for
the
state
in
this
country.
the
waters
of
louisiana
so
shallow,
there's
no
way
for
them
to
be
of
any
benefit
to
any
foreign
commerce,
they're
not
like
the
santa
barbara
channel.
the
santa
barbara
channel
is
2000
feet
deep.
we're
talking
about
waters
for
the
most
part
of
an
outboard
motorboat
has
traveled
getting
in.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no,
sir.
in
east
bay,
can
i
turn
over
to
that?
in
east
bay,
the
government
says,
the
high
seas,
this
is
the
limit
of
the
high
seas.
this
is
a
three-mile
territorial
sea.
this
line
represents
the
high
seas.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
but
the
united
states
government
does,
it
says
three
miles.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no
sir,
the
convention
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
there
was
no
agreement
on
the
territorial
sea.
russia
claimed
12
miles.
we
claim
three
miles.
we
could
not
agree
but
the
united
states
has
consistently
asserted
three
miles
and
under
their
present
position,
this
would
make
a
substantial
part
of
east
bay
high
seas.
we
would
assert
no
plain
rule.
now,
the
acts
of
congress
and
regulations
required
that
the
inland
rules
be
used
by
all
vessels
both
foreign
and
domestic
inside
these
lines.
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
agencies
entrusted
with
the
enforcement
of
these
laws
commencing
with
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
on
up
now
to
the
coast
guard
did
in
fact
enforced
these
laws
and
the
government
doesn't
deny
that
they
did.
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
inland
rules
of
the
road
where
in
fact
enforced
inside
these
lines
both
on
domestic
vessels
and
foreign
vessels
and
the
government
doesn't
deny
that
either.
and
yet,
that's
not
a
single
instance,
there
is
not
a
single
instance
of
any
objection
by
any
foreign
nation
or
any
foreign
vessel
to
these
lines.
not
only
has
there
been
toleration
but
we
feel
that
there's
been
a
complete
acquiescence
but
this
isn't
the
end
of
the
story.
louisiana
has
exercised
sovereignty
within
these
waters.
beginning
in
1870,
louisiana
enacted
extensive
statute
regulating
the
oyster,
fishing
and
shrimping
industry.
all
of
these
statutes
have
been
applied
and
interpreted
as
applying
to
the
inland
waters
of
louisiana
including
east
bay.
oyster
leases
have
been
granted
in
east
bay.
some
of
the
shrimp
statutes
specifically
mentioned
east
bay.
arrests
have
been
made
in
east
for
the
violation
of
the
shrimping
regulations.
the
louisiana
department
of
wildlife
and
fisheries
patrolled
east
bay
in
boats
to
enforce
the
regulations.
no
questions
have
ever
been
raised
not
by
the
united
states;
no
foreign
vessel,
not
even
the
persons
who
were
arrested.
other
control
has
also
been
exercised
by
the
local
officials
of
other
activities
and
large
oil
field
is
located
at
east
bay
and
therein
lies
the
problem.
part
of
this
oil
field
extends
in
to
the
part
that
the
government
says
this
is
now
high
seas.
this
map
is
prepared
by
shell
oil
company
showing
its
facilities
in
this
area.
it's
obvious
that
the
congestion
virtually
precludes
(voice
overlap)
--
any
foreign
vessels.
yes
sir,
that's
your
map
number
16.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
but
louisiana
is
not
the
only
one
has
considered
this
bay
to
be
inland
waters.
the
united
states
has
always
considered
it
to
be
inland
waters
and
in
1940
when
the
census
bureau
undertook
the
re-measurement
of
the
united
states,
they
included
all
of
east
bay
as
the
inland
waters
of
america.
this
map
shows
the
location
of
the
line
that
was
drawn
by
the
census
bureau
in
1940.
now,
the
government
we
exercise
no
sovereignty,
yet
we
control
navigation
so
there's
no
freedom
of
navigation.
we
control
fishing,
there's
no
freedom
of
fishing.
we
control
pipelines
and
air
flight
in
this
bay
also.
this
country
exercise
--
has
exercised
complete
sovereignty
over
east
bay
and
no
nation
has
ever
raised
any
objection.
they've
abided
by
laws
in
east
bay
and
all
of
the
conditions
for
historic
waters
have
been
met
not
only
from
classic
sense
of
sovereignty
but
also
from
a
legal
sense
of
geography.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
the
shell
oil
company
map
shows
that
oil
--
this
is
what
started
the
whole
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
not
now.
not
now,
your
honor,
because
under
the
convention
on
the
high
seas
this
is
granted
to
all
nations.
but
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
--
before
that
happen
it
was,
before
the
occurred
it
was.
before
the
act
--
before
mr.
truman's
proclamation
and
the
continental
shell
act
than
any
act
that
louisiana
performed
over
this
bay
was
an
act
of
sovereignty
and
we
did
grant
leases
and
that's
what
started
this
whole
litigation.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
that's
our
contention,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
the
government
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
--
contends
that
we
must
have
claimed
ownership
of
this
bay
as
part
of
the
territory
of
this
bay.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
your
honor,
we
think
you
can.
we
think
that
the
law
presumes
that
these
officials
exercised,
they
had
performed
their
duties
and
enforce
the
laws
and
the
government
doesn't
deny
that
they
enforce
the
laws
in
navigation
down
there.
they
do
not
deny
that
the
navigation
laws
were
in
fact
enforced.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
we
can
file
in
the
record
reports
of
arrest
that
had
been
made.
we
filed
in
the
record
that
oyster
leases
that
have
been
made.
maybe
we
should
ask
the
government
what
facts
they
dispute,
i
don't
know.
my
time
is
running
out,
i
want
to
cover
one
more
area
before
i
quit
and
that's
caillou
bay
which
is
in
your
map
number
21.
caillou
bay
again
serves
as
an
example
of
the
restrictive
interpretation
of
the
government.
the
government
says
that
islands
may
not
be
used
to
foreign
bays
and
yet
they
used
the
same
mass
of
islands
which
we
used
as
the
western
part
of
caillou
bay
to
form
the
adjoining
timbalier
bay.
but
they
say
these
islands
can
enclose
bays.
these
islands
are
separated
from
the
mainland
by
one
foot
of
water,
one
foot
of
water
going
to
coast
job.
the
maximum
depth
of
water
in
this
bay
is
7
feet
and
most
of
the
bay
is
about
5
to
6
feet
deep,
but
they
say
this
is
like
santa
barbara
channel.
they
say
this
is
the
same
thing
the
santa
barbara
channel
which
this
court
held
not
to
be
inland
water.
to
show
the
difference,
this
is
a
coast
chart
of
santa
barbara
channel.
we
have
reproduced
caillou
bay
at
the
same
scale
as
this
coast
chart
and
this
is
caillou
bay.
it's
a
small
i
don't
even
think
you
can
see
it.
but
this
is
caillou
bay
that
the
government
says
it's
like
the
santa
barbara
channel.
the
depth
of
water
in
caillou
bay
is
5
to
6
feet
deep.
the
depth
of
water
in
the
santa
barbara
channel
is
2000
feet
deep.
now,
this
is
a
kind
of
water
we're
talking
about
in
louisiana.
we're
talking
about
tons,
we're
not
talking
about
2000-foot
seagoing
channels
even
the
chapman
line,
even
the
chapman
line,
in
1950
drawn
by
secretary
of
the
interior
chapman
enclosed
east
bay.
as
a
result,
it
had
never
even
--
not
east
bay,
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
caillou
bay.
this
bay
has
never
been
considered
as
being
in
dispute
and
no
moneys
have
even
been
impounded,
it
was
never
regarded
as
being
disputable.
and
then
the
first
louisiana
case,
the
government
conceded
that
all
the
waters
located
situated
between
the
islands
and
the
main
lands
are
inland
water
because
the
islands
are
so
situated
as
to
enclose
inland
waters.
now,
they
say
caillou
bay
is
part
of
the
high
seas
six-foot
water
part
of
the
high
seas.
i
want
to
mention
the
dredged
channels.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
three
miles
from
the
shore.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
three
miles
from
shore.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
they
say
islands
may
not
be
used
under
the
convention
to
(voice

--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
well,
fortunately
it's
within
the
three-mile
limit
but
if
it
were
not
it
would
high
seas.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
it's
territorial
sea.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
now,
i've
mentioned
the
dredged
channels
before
as
being
necessary
for
this
state
and
in
every
single
port
that
we
have
in
louisiana
including
the
port
of
new
orleans
it's
been
necessary
to
dredged
channels
in
order
to
reach
that
port
even
the
passes
at
the
river
silt
up
and
no
one
--
and
no
boats
can
get
in
without
dredged
channels.
this
is
a
dredged
channel
off
the
coast
of,
i
believe,
its
channel
of
calcasieu
and
cameron
parish.
this
dredged
channel
--
similar
dredged
channel
was
held
to
be
inland
waters
in
the
case
of
a
delaware.
this
was
getting
its
channel
in
leading
to
new
york
harbor
in
which
the
court
said,
it's
as
much
the
inland
waters
as
new
york
harbor
itself.
article
8
of
the
convention
provides
that
the
outer
most
permanent
harbour
works
which
form
an
integral
part
of
the
harbour
system
shall
be
regarded
as
forming
part
of
the
coastline.
these
are
permanent.
they're
cut
into
the
bid
of
a
gulf
of
mexico.
the
united
states
government
has
spent
over
$300
million
and
all
shores
in
louisiana
dredging
these
channels.
they
currently
spend
money
maintaining
these
channels
and
these
are
not
mere
buoy
channels.
the
earth
dredged
out
of
these
channels
as
deposited
on
the
bank
of
the
cut
in
the
form
of
a
spoiled
bank
and
it
impedes
navigation.
but
without
the
channels
no
vessel
could
navigate
beyond
a
rowboat
or
an
outboard
motorboat
or
some
other
small
type
of
boat
but
they're
not
buoy.
these
channels
are
marked
by
tremendous
steel
and
concrete
towers
that
are
sunk
in
the
bed
of
a
gulf
of
mexico
at
over
60
feet
tall.
they
are
truly
represents
the
outermost
permanent
harbour
works
which
formed
an
integral
part
of
the
harbour
system
of
louisiana
and
under
article
8
of
the
convention.
they're
part
of
the
coastline.
that
article
doesn't
--
the
government
objects
to
these
because
they
are
submerged.
that
article
doesn't
mention
anything
about
being
submerged.
it
says
permanent
harbour
works.
the
government
says
we
can't
measure
them
from
a
low
water
line.
the
convention
doesn't
say
anything
about
measuring
permanent
harbour
works
from
the
low
water
line.
the
convention
says
if
they
are
part
of
the
harbour
works,
they
are
an
integral
part
of
the
harbour
system.
they
are
regarded
as
part
of
the
coast
to
louisiana.
one
more
factor
i
want
to
mention
in
its
decree,
the
government
is
asking
that
this
court
limit
the
effect
to
this
decision
to
the
chapman
line
and
yet,
they
are
claiming
caillou
bay
beyond
the
chapman
line.
we
think
this
decree
must
settle
the
lands
underneath
navigable
waters
which
will
confirm
to
the
states
by
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes
sir,
we
need
a
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
short
time
left
to
me,
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
your
honors
that
mr.
cox
is
in
error
about
east
bay,
the
navigation
laws
that
the
united
states
published
in
1940
shows
precisely
that
east
bay
was
considered
inland
waters
of
the
united
states
at
the
time
of
its
publication
as
you'll
see
on
page
418.
he
is
in
error
also
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
navigation
laws
of
the
united
states
of
1940
published
by
the
department
of
commerce
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
it
describes
the
lines
just
as
there
had
been
described
before.
it
isn't
a
chart,
it
is
a
book.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
but
it
is
there.
he
is
in
error
in
our
opinion
in
his
reference
to
the
annapolis
which
i
think
is
so
important
in
relation
to
justice
white's
question
because
there,
the
brief
said
precisely
that
their
right
to
regulate
foreign
vessels
was
limited
to
their
own
jurisdiction
so
to
our
inland
waters.
we
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
justice
stewart
raised
a
proper
point
with
reference
to
the
word
“normal”
in
the
geneva
convention.
it
couldn't
have
been
put
there
meaninglessly
by
all
the
people
who
went
to
that
convention
when
the
word
“normal”
indicates
that
if
an
abnormal
situation
exists
a
different
treatment
is
to
be
accorded.
one
final
word,
the
state
department
may
have
the
right
for
our
government
to
act
in
determining
whether
our
boundary
is
three
miles,
three
leagues
or
a
greater
number
of
leagues
from
our
coast.
but
the
congress
confined
it
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
not
to
the
state
department
the
right
the
duty
to
mark
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
and
he
did
so.
and
he
did
so
by
these
lines
which
have
been
on
published
charts
for
years.
and
when
i
asked
the
commandant
of
the
coastguard
last
year
when
he
proposed
the
change
of
it
if
any,
any
foreign
government,
any
foreign
vessel,
anyone
else
had
ever
protested
that
line,
he
said
if
there
is
such
a
protest
we
will
advice
you
and
none
such
has
been
given.
we
say
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
sir?
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir
and
there
have
been
large
charts
which
showed
all
of
these
lines
starting
back
from
1895.
this
much
of
the
line
has
been
on
the
chart
only
since
1953
but
the
lines
marking
the
points
marking
it
had
been
there
for
many
years
designated
and
defined
by
the
same
federal
authority.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
i
would
certainly
think
so
justice
black,
if
not
it
has
not
yet
been
suggested
to
us
who
in
the
federal
government
will
do
this
if
the
agency
directed
by
congress
to
do
it
is
not
the
one
to
do
it.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
i
hope
not,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
i'll
answer
the
first
question
your
honor.
as
you
know
this
court
held
in
the
first
louisiana
case
that
louisiana
owned
none
of
the
marginal
sea
that
our
title
stopped
at
the
inland
water
--
at
the
inland
waters
that
we
own
the
inland
waters
under
the
doctrine
of
pollard
versus
hagan,
and
pollard
versus
hagan
was
in
that
case
and
in
the
california
case
limited
to
inland
waters
with
the
result
we
owned
nothing
beyond
inland
waters
none
of
the
territorial
sea.
following
that,
congress
passed
his
submerged
land
act
by
which
they
confirmed
and
granted
to
the
states
a
three-mile
belt
of
marginal
sea
lying
outside
of
its
inland
waters.
the
--
it
not
only
confirmed
the
grant
to
the
three-mile
belt
but
in
cases
where
the
state's
boundary,
historic
boundary
extended
beyond
three
miles
it
confirmed
it
out
to
its
historic
boundary.
the
second
louisiana
case
held
that
we
did
not
have
a
historic
boundary
extending
three
leagues
that
we
had
contended.
although,
this
court
held
and
the
government
conceded
in
that
case
that
we
did
on
the
islands
within
three
leagues
of
the
coast
and
that
we
also
owned
the
water
between
those
islands
and
the
shore
because
they
were
so
situated
as
to
enclose
inland
waters.
now,
this
case
is
to
determine
where
the
limit
of
the
inland
waters
of
louisiana
are,
the
inland
waters
that
belong
to
this
state
under
pollard
versus
hagan.
and
once
we
determine
where
the
inland
waters
are,
then
we
measure
three
miles
outside
of
those
inland
waters
for
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
your
honor,
we
have
felt
that
we
must
accept
the
california
case
in
holding
that
the
geneva
convention
applies.
we
may
not
agree
with
that
but
that
was
the
holding
of
this
court.
now,
if
you
will
remember
this
case
--
this
court
in
the
texas
case
and
in
the
florida
case
awarded
both
texas
and
florida
their
historic
limits,
texas
goes
out
three
leagues,
florida
goes
out
three
leagues
but
alabama,
mississippi
and
louisiana
were
brought
into
their
shores
into
their
inland
water.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes
sir,
but
the
inland
water
land
mr.
sachse
argued
yesterday
is
the
limit
of
our
inland
waters.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
historic
boundaries.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no
sir,
i
did
not
say
that
we
conceded
that.
i
said
that
for
the
purposes
of
our
alternative
coastline
i
want
to
argue
(voice
overlap)
we
have
assumed
that
this
court
will
follow.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
absolutely.
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
nothing
that
i
say
should
be
construed
in
any
manner
as
detracting
from
a
primary
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
we
filed
an
alternative
motion
asserting
an
alternative
coastline
primarily
in
our
position
of
the
restrictive
and
narrow
interpretation
of
this
convention
that
the
justice
department
put
on
it.
they
have
come
up
with
a
line
for
louisiana's
inland
waters
that's
virtually
a
shoreline.
and
it's
my
purpose
to
point
out
to
this
court
that
even
--
that
whether
or
not
you
accept
the
inland
water
lines
and
mr.
sachse
advocates
there's
no
justification
for
the
line
that
the
government
continues.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes
sir,
to
a
great
extent
mr.
justice
to
great
extent.
we
feel
that
the
shores
of
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
particularly
louisiana
are
so
shallow,
there's
so
changing.
there's
no
way
the
foreign
commerce
or
any
ocean
going
commerce
to
go
anywhere
in
louisiana
because
of
the
shallow
waters.
we've
had
the
dredged
channel,
the
united
states
government
spent
over
$300
million
dredging
channels
in
to
the
ports
of
louisiana.
there
could
be
no
commerce,
they
would
be
no
port
but
for
these
dredged
channels,
this
is
a
gently
sloping
shore,
it
is
of
no
value
at
all
to
foreign
commerce.
and
we
feel
that
these
are
factors
that
this
court
must
take
into
consideration
in
determining
what
are
the
inland
waters
of
louisiana
in
the
gulf
of
mexico.
now,
i
have
already
alluded
to
the
disagreement
between
the
government
and
i
say
that
was
the
interpretation
of
the
convention.
louisiana
takes
the
position
that
the
convention
is
a
general
document
that
it
could
not
possibly
be
held
to
cover
every
complexity
and
every
detail
of
every
coast
in
the
world.
we
think
it's
like
the
united
states
constitution
and
that
--
it
must
be
interpreted
liberally
in
order
to
make
it
work.
the
government
on
the
other
hand
said
we've
got
to
stick
to
the
letter
of
that
document
that
we
can't
go
beyond
its
four
corners
and
where
it
silent
it
is
prohibitive.
it
denies
to
us
principles
of
international
law
that
are
well
established.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
that
where
the
convention
is
silent
it
is
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
--
it
is
prohibitive.
for
example,
the
convention
is
silent
on
whether
or
not
islands
may
be
used
to
form
that
perimeter
of
bays
or
to
enclose
inland
waters.
the
government
takes
the
fact
position
that
that
means
it
is
prohibitive
that
we
may
not
use
islands
to
enclose
inland
waters.
yet,
in
every
single
instance
of
every
bay
that
they
have
recognized
along
our
coast
they
do
in
fact
used
islands
to
form
the
perimeters
of
those
bays.
as
a
result
of
this
type
of
narrow
interpretation
of
this
convention,
the
government
has
arrived
of
what
we
consider
as
shoreline.
it
has
changed
the
status
of
the
inland
waters
of
louisiana
from
inland
to
the
high
seas.
it's
changed
the
status
of
the
inland
waters
which
have
been
recognized
by
this
court
to
be
inland.
a
typical
example
of
this
is
in
chandeleur
and
breton
islands.
these
waters
are
enclosed
by
the
chandeleur
island
and
by
breton
island.
the
government
concedes
--
now,
listen
to
this,
the
government
concedes
that
these
waters
are
inland
but
they
say
that
they're
inland
only
because
of
the
concessions
they
made
in
this
prior
case
where
they
admitted
and
conceded
when
we
were
arguing
for
a
three-league
limit.
they
admitted
that
all
of
the
island
within
three
leagues
with
the
territory
of
louisiana
and
that
all
of
the
waters
between
the
islands
and
the
mainland
was
so
situated
as
to
enclose
inland
waters.
this
court
recognized
this
in
the
first
louisiana
case
and
pointed
out
that
these
waters
had
become
vested
in
louisiana
at
the
time
it
was
admitted
into
the
union
and
our
territory
under
the
adoption
of
pollard
versus
hagan.
in
the
california
case,
this
court
again
recognized
that
these
waters
were
inland.
it
distinguished
them
from
the
santa
barbara
channel
which
the
court
had
held
connected
two
areas
of
the
open
sea.
in
distinguishing
these
waters
from
the
santa
barbara
channel,
it
pointed
out
that
breton
island
was
a
cul-de-sac
that
chandeleur
island
led
only
to
breton
island
if
it
led
anywhere
that
neither
served
as
a
route
of
passage
between
two
areas
of
the
open
sea
and
both
was
so
shallow
as
to
be
navigable.
now,
the
government
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
your
honor,
where
is
the
mainland
(voice
overlap).
these
are
all
islands.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
this
is
mississippi.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
this
is
the
mass
of
islands
that
goes
to
the
main.
this
is
city
of
new
orleans,
right
here.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
all
of
louisiana's
shoreline
is
out.
this
is
what
makes
it
so
difficult
to
apply
this
convention
without
the
use
of
a
straight
baseline
system.
now,
these
waters
have
been
phrased
not
only
that
it
recognized
in
the
phrase
of
louisiana
case
and
in
the
california
case.
they
have
been
recognized
as
inland
waters
of
louisiana
in
case
in
1905
before
this
court
involving
a
boundary
dispute
between
louisiana
and
mississippi.
even
that
chapman
line
which
the
secretary
of
interior
chapman
drew
in
1950
as
the
most
landward
position
the
government
could
claim
in
these
waters
recognized
that
these
were
inland
and
enclosed
the
water
outside
the
chandeleur
islands.
they
were
again
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
supplemental
decree
in
1965
because
we
were
awarded
title
to
waters
line
outside
of
breton
island.
but
now,
the
government
says,
the
convention
has
changed
all
of
it
that
there's
now
no
legal
basis
for
holding
these
waters
to
be
inland
that
the
convention
is
reclassified
them
into
the
high
seas.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
in
this
particular
area,
your
honor?
mr.
j.
b.
miller
it's
about
15
miles
between
these
islands
and
these
islands.
the
government
says
that
the
convention
means
that
we
only
get
a
three-mile
belt
around
each
island.
so,
there
would
be
a
strip
of
high
seas
in
there.
but
the
government
doesn't
withdraw
its
concession.
it
does
not
withdraw
its
concession
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
in
this
particular
water,
it
does
not
withdraw
its
concession.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
it
applies
its
--
it
withdraws
in
anywhere
else.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
but
it
says
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
that's
right.
it
says,
except
for
its
concession
in
this
particular
instance
these
waters
would
be
high
seas
that
the
convention
has
changed
the
status
from
inland
waters
to
high
seas.
now,
we
say
that
congress
never
intended
any
such
results.
we
say
that
the
congressional
hearings
and
the
hearings
before
the
committee
on
their
adoption
of
a
geneva
convention,
the
committee
asked
the
state
department
this
very
question.
are
there
any
waters
which
are
now
entitled
but
which
would
become
high
seas
if
we
adopted
this
convention.
and
the
state
department's
answer
was
in
the
negative.
now,
we
say
that
the
convention
has
not
changed
these
waters
that
the
convention
should
be
interpreted
liberally
and
it
should
be
interpreted
so
as
to
continue
the
principles
of
international
law
which
were
in
existence
prior
to
the
convention
and
which
are
not
conferred
to
the
convention.
but
if
we're
wrong
and
if
the
government
is
right
and
if
the
convention
should
be
interpreted
as
to
change
the
status
of
inland
waters
from
inland
to
the
high
seas
then
we
say
that
these
waters
must
be
recognized
as
historic
waters
which
are
accepted
from
the
convention.
the
convention
expressly
accepts
the
category
of
historic
waters.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
if
the
government
contends
that
the
convention
changed
the
status
of
inland
waters
and
the
government
contends
that
the
convention
changed
the
boundary
of
this
country
and
took
away
the
territory
of
louisiana
and
we
say
that
if
that's
true
and
we
don't
think
it
is
but
if
that's
true,
then
we
say
that
the
act
of
congress
adopt
in
this
convention
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
because
congress
may
not
divest
the
state
of
its
sovereign
territory.
it
may
not
see
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
your
honor,
the
constitution
provides,
i
believe,
in
article
iv
that
congress
may
not
take
away
the
part
of
one
state
to
form
another
state
and
that
it
may
not
add
territory
to
the
first
state
without
its
consent.
the
second
article
provides
that
the
power
of
congress
to
seed
and
sell
its
own
property,
its
own
territory
is
an
incumbent.
the
cases
have
held
under
this
that
congress
may
not
change
the
boundaries
of
a
state
without
that
state's
consent.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
there
is
no
expressed
provision
in
the
constitution
saying
that
congress
may
not
take
away
the
territory
of
a
state
and
give
it
to
a
foreign
nation.
but,
we
say
that
if
it
can't
take
away
the
territory
of
a
state
and
give
it
to
another
state,
it
must
follow
that
it
can't
give
it
to
the
family
of
nations.
and
cases
have
so
held
in
the
california
case,
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
that
the
contraction
of
a
state's
boundary
in
the
name
of
foreign
relations
would
be
highly
questionable
and
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
several
cases
in
which
the
courts
have
held
that
congress
may
not
contract
the
state's
boundary
or
cede
its
territory
without
the
consent
of
that
state.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no,
sir.
the
government
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
government's
contention
as
i
understand
it
is
that
by
virtue
of
the
adoption
of
the
treaty
that
there
is
now
no
legal
basis
for
these
waters
remaining
inland
waters
but
since
they
have
conceded
that
they
were
inland
waters
in
the
earlier
case
that
they
do
not
deal
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
withdraw
that
concession.
now,
a
similar
situation
exists
in
the
mississippi
river
delta.
your
map
number
five
will
portray
this
area.
louisiana's
alternative
coastline
is
shown
in
solid
green
and
its
three-mile
limit
is
shown
in
dusked
green
lines.
the
government's
coastline
the
more
restrictive
one
is
shown
in
solid
brown
where
there
are
no
brown
lines
the
government
uses
the
shore
as
the
line.
the
government's
three-mile
limit
is
shown
in
dusked
brown.
now,
we
all
know
of
the
importance
of
the
mississippi
river.
this
river
extends
not
only
through
louisiana,
it
goes
all
the
way
to
the
ohio
and
the
midwest
and
the
missouri
and
the
west.
this
is
a
river
that
was
responsible
for
the
louisiana
purchase.
it
participated
in
the
war
of
1812
and
other
wars.
it's
the
most
important
waterway
in
this
country.
now,
it
is
inland
water.
could
the
government
cede
the
mississippi
river
to
the
foreign
--
to
the
family
of
foreign
nations
and
say
this
is
high
seas
just
by
doctrine
of
treaty?
certainly
not,
the
treaty
making
power
of
congress
is
limited
to
the
constitutional
power
granted
congress.
the
government
concedes
that
most
of
these
waters
are
geographical
--
geographic
inland
waters.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
that
means
that
under
the
convention,
they
qualify
mathematically
as
a
bay.
for
example,
they
say
that
west
bay
in
going
to
island
bay
qualify
as
bays
geographically
under
the
mathematical
formulas
of
the
convention.
louisiana
cites
that
all
of
these
waters
are
inland
waters
both
historically
and
geographically.
and
while
the
government
concedes
that
most
of
them
do
the
major
exception
is
east
bay.
they
say
that
east
bay
is
high
seas.
now,
east
bay
is
the
most
important
bay
in
this
delta
area.
all
of
this
area
was
formed
by
sediment.
it's
continuing
to
deposit
sediment.
this
passage
are
changing,
some
of
them
being
extended
seaward
others
are
regressive
it's
an
ever
changing
area.
but
going
back
to
east
bay,
the
government
says
that
east
bay
is
high
seas
because
it
does
not
qualify
under
article
7
of
the
convention.
now,
article
7
defines
a
bay
as
a
well-marked
indentation
whose
depth
of
penetration
is
sufficient
to
enclose
waters,
east
bay
meets
that
test,
it
obviously
has
no
mere
curvature
of
the
coast.
another
requirement
is
that
the
width
of
the
bay
may
not
exceed
24
miles.
east
bay
is
only
15
miles.
but
article
7
also
requires
that
the
area
of
the
bay
must
be
at
least
equal
to
the
area
of
a
semicircle,
the
diameter
of
which
is
a
closing
line
of
the
bay.
since
east
bay
does
not
meet
this
test
in
it
entirety,
the
government
says,
no
bay
its
high
seas.
we
do
point
out
at
this
point
however
that
a
substantial
portion
of
east
bay
does
meet
the
semicircle
test
and
this
map
shows
a
red
line
which
satisfy
the
semicircle
test
and
the
convention
in
every
respect.
the
government
even
denies
it.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no
your
honor.
we
think
that
this
case
can
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
this
record.
now,
i'm
not
going
to
go
into
a
lot
of
detail
about
selection
of
headlines
and
whether
we
should
select
the
point
here
that's
200
feet
from
a
point
there.
but
there
are
principles
that
are
involved
in
this
case
that
i
think
this
court
must
decide
even
before
a
mass
that
could
start
on
this
case.
and
the
one
principle
that
i've
mentioned
before
is
what
about
the
inland
waters
that
qualified
as
inland
waters
and
form
part
of
the
sovereign
territory
of
louisiana
before
the
adoption
of
this
convention.
a
master
could
not
start
on
this
case
without
the
answer
to
that
question.
there
aren't
really
any
substantial
factual
disputes
in
this
case
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
your
honor,
we
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
--
in
this
alternative
argument
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
i'd
like
to
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
i
think
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
i
think
i
can
clear
that
for
your
honor
right
now.
we
do
not
depart
from
the
convention.
we
say
that
government's
interpretation
of
the
convention
is
wrong
and
but
that
if
you
do
follow
the
government's
interpretation
then
you
must
hold
the
convention
to
be
constitutional.
we
interpret
the
convention
so
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes
sir,
if
you
adopt
the
government's
interpretation
of
it.
if
you
adopt
our
interpretation
of
it
you
do
not.
article
7
accepts
the
category
of
historic
bays
from
this
mathematical
formula.
it
is
our
position
that
if
a
body
of
water
has
qualified
its
inland
waters
throughout
the
history
of
this
country
if
it
has
been
the
inland
waters
and
territory
of
a
state
throughout
the
history
of
this
country
then
it
is
historic
inland
waters
and
it
is
accepted
from
the
mathematical
requirements
of
this
brand
new
semicircle
test.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no,
your
honor
historic
bays
are
accepted
in
the
convention
itself.
article
7
of
the
convention
provides
that
the
foregoing
provision
shall
not
apply
to
so-called
historic
bays.
we
say
these
are
historic
bays.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
the
government
says
they
are
historic
bays
that
they
are
no
longer
inland
waters
and
that
they
are
high
seas.
we
say
if
that
is
a
proper
interpretation
of
this
convention
then
the
convention
must
be
unconstitutional.
but
we
don't
think
it's
unconstitutional.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
in
east
bay,
that
is
true,
yes
sir.
now,
louisiana
claims
east
bay
as
historic
waters
not
only
in
the
legal
sense
that
we've
just
been
talking
about
as
having
qualified
as
inland
waters
previously
but
also
in
the
historical
sense
of
exercise
of
sovereignty.
at
the
time
of
the
louisiana
purchase
in
1803
and
when
louisiana
was
admitted
to
the
union
in
1812
there
was
no
mathematical
requirement
for
a
bay.
there
was
no
limitation
upon
the
closing
line.
the
only
requirement
was
that
the
bay
have
the
general
configuration
and
characteristics
of
a
bay
and
that
its
depth
of
penetration
be
such
as
to
enclose
inland
waters
along
each
sides.
certainly,
east
bay
met
this
test
and
this
map
of
1838
shows
a
configuration
of
east
bay
at
that
time.
earlier
maps
show
the
same
general
configuration
and
we
can
assume
that
this
was
a
configuration
in
1812.
it's
obvious
that
its
depth
of
penetration
was
sufficient
to
enclose
inland
waters
and
it
therefore
qualified
as
the
inland
waters
for
the
state
of
louisiana
when
it
was
admitted
to
the
union
and
became
part
of
a
territory
of
this
state
under
adoption
of
pollard
versus
hagan.
not
only
is
this
true
but
louisiana's
act
of
admission,
its
act
of
admission
includes
all
of
its
inland
waters.
it
was
described
as
being
bounded
on
the
south
by
the
gulf
of
mexico
not
the
shore
but
the
gulf
of
mexico.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
your
honor,
unfortunately,
it
did
not
appear
in
the
appendix,
it
is
--
i
mean
in
the
index
to
the
appendix.
it
is
in
our
appendices
to
the
brief
at
page
127.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
i
don't
think
they
have
the
entire
convention.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
section
6
of
article
7
is
the
one
to
which
i
refer.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
this
--
no
sir,
i'm
sure
they
left
it
out.
but
this
small
appendix
to
our
brief
is
the
one
that
contends.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
on
page
--
it
starts
on
127,
the
article
the
i
referred
to
is
number
6
on
page
130.
it
says
before
going
--
after
going
through
all
the
mathematical
test
of
bays,
it
says,
“the
foregoing
provision
shall
not
apply
to
so-called
historic
bays
or
in
any
case
where
the
straight
baseline
system
is
used.”
now,
going
back
to
louisiana's
boundaries,
each
boundary
was
a
gulf
of
mexico
since
east
bay
was
inland
waters
it
was
obviously
not
the
gulf
of
mexico,
it
became
the
territory
of
this
state
in
1812
and
remains
the
territory
of
this
state
under
the
doctrine
of
pollard
versus
hagan.
now,
towards
the
turn
of
the
century,
international
law
had
begun
to
develop
a
limitation
upon
closing
lines.
and
the
10-mile
closing
line
was
mentioned
with
increasing
frequency
and
several
countries
had
adopted
it.
this
chart
shows
that
east
bay
in
1895
more
than
adequately
satisfied
even
the
10-mile
lines.
this
map
also
shows
another
interesting
factor.
grande
pass
is
a
peninsula
in
east
bay
when
the
united
states
government
started
the
improvement
of
navigation
at
south
pass.
this
grande
pass
was
dammed
off
to
force
more
water
through
south
pass.
as
a
result
of
this
procedure,
the
sediment
flow
in
the
east
bay
was
curtailed.
grande
pass
subsided
and
eventually
disappeared.
the
1922
coast
chart
shows
this.
it
shows
east
bay
after
this
occurrence.
the
passes
at
south
and
southwest
pass
had
continued
to
go
forward
but
grande
pass
had
disappeared.
east
bay
had
a
greater
penetration
than
depth
of
penetration
than
ever
before
but
for
the
first
time
its
entrance
exceeded
10
miles.
at
that
time,
international
law
said,
you
draw
a
10-mile
line
at
the
close
--
at
the
nearest
point
within
the
bay
which
does
not
exceed
10-miles.
south
pass
and
southwest
pass
have
continued
to
grow,
they're
still
growing.
in
1958,
when
the
convention
was
adopted
this
was
a
configuration
of
east
bay.
it
was
still
a
bay.
it
still
had
the
sufficient
depth
of
penetration
to
be
a
bay.
it
is
long
since
then
and
the
next
map
shows
the
1968
depth
of
penetration
and
width
at
the
bay.
now,
the
government
says
that
the
10-mile
rule
never
became
international
law.
we
don't
know,
but
we
say
this
that
if
it
never
became
international
law
then
there
was
no
limitation
and
east
bay
remain
the
bay
and
inland
waters
of
this
state
by
virtue
of
its
general
configuration
and
characteristics
as
a
bay.
it
certainly
had
sufficient
depth
of
penetration.
now,
we've
shown
that
east
bay
has
been
part
of
a
territory
of
this
state
since
the
beginning,
since
1812.
we
say
that
the
convention
cannot
now
divest
louisiana
of
this
territory
without
the
convention
being
unconstitutional.
since
the
time
of
historic
bays
is
accepted
from
the
strict,
inflexible
mathematical
requirements
that
will
inject
international
law
in
1958,
we
say
that
east
bay
is
a
historic
bay
by
virtue
of
having
always
qualified
as
a
bay
throughout
the
history
of
this
country
and
that
congress
has
no
power
to
do
otherwise.
it
has
no
more
power
to
disclaim
title
to
east
bay
than
it
does
in
mississippi
river
or
the
district
of
columbia.
but
east
bay
had
not
owned
a
qualified
geographically
as
a
bay.
the
classic
definition
under
international
law
of
historic
water
is
waters
over
which
a
nation
has
exercised
sovereignty
for
a
considerable
period
of
time
with
an
attitude
of
general
toleration
among
foreign
states.
now,
the
government
says
we've
exercised
no
sovereignty
but
it
confuses
ownership
with
sovereignty.
it
seems
to
imply
that
the
united
states
must
have
openly
and
expressly
asserted
a
clean
that
east
bay
was
a
part
of
the
territory
of
this
nation.
this
is
not
necessary,
sovereignty
does
not
mean
ownership.
sovereignty
is
authority,
it's
the
exercise
of
power
or
control;
it's
less
than
complete
territoriality.
this
is
made
clear
that
the
1962
study
of
the
united
nations
which
we
understand
the
government
has
adopted
in
the
alaska
case
but
it's
not
necessary
for
this
classic
type
of
definition
of
historic
waters
that
all
conceivable
acts
of
sovereignty
be
exercised.
it's
only
necessary
that
a
nation
exercise
some
act
of
sovereignty
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
concept
of
high
seas.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no,
sir.
the
convention
is
silent
on
the
definition
of
historic
waters
and
it's
our
contention
that
that
time
was
accepted
from
these
mathematical
requirements
to
serve
as
a
safety
valve
for
the
various
situations
we're
talking
about
as
well
as
other
situations.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
that's
the
only
time
it's
even
mentioned
your
honor.
there
is
no
definition
in
the
convention.
now,
the
definition
that
is
recommended
by
the
united
nation
is
the
classic
definition
that
i'm
talking
about
now,
it's
the
exercise
of
sovereignty
and
that
means
that
a
nation
has
exercised
some
sovereignty
for
a
considerable
period
of
time.
that's
the
best
time
they
could
come
up
with
was
the
word
“considerable”
with
the
general
attitude
of
toleration
by
foreign
nations.
but
it's
not
necessary
that
all
acts
of
sovereignty
be
exercise
only
and
necessary
that
there
will
be
--
the
exercise
of
some
act
of
sovereignty
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
concept
of
high
seas.
in
the
norwegian
fisheries
case
which
held
norway's
waters
to
be
historic
behind
their
baselines,
the
only
claim
that
norway
ever
made
was
the
fishing.
they
claim
fishing
rights
and
by
virtue
of
those
rights
having
been
asserted
for
so
long
of
time
and
the
lines
having
been
drawn,
they
were
held
to
be
historic
borders.
now,
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
concept
of
high
seas
to
exercise
limited
control
which
is
permitted
by
the
convention
within
the
contiguous
zone.
as
for
example
the
--
to
prevent
the
infringement
of
your
custom
laws,
the
infringement
of
your
immigration
laws
or
your
sanitary
laws,
there
is
a
fringe
around
the
territorial
sea
and
which
you
may
exercise
limited
control
to
prevent
violation
of
a
nation's
laws
with
in
its
own
territorial
sea.
but
we're
not
talking
about
that
here.
we're
talking
about
the
freedom
of
the
seas
and
the
freedom
of
the
seas
is
where
a
nation
may
not
exercise
sovereignty
unless
its
claim
in
these
waters
as
its
own
and
the
freedom
of
the
high
seas
which
are
set
forth
in
the
convention
on
the
high
seas
or
freedom
of
navigation,
freedom
of
fishing,
freedom
of
flight,
and
freedom
to
lay
pipe
lines.
if
sovereignty
is
exercised
in
any
one
of
these
theories
it's
absolutely
inconsistent
with
the
concept
of
high
seas
and
can
be
justified
only
on
a
basis
that
the
nation
is
claiming
the
waters
as
its
very
own.
now,
we
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
not
quite,
your
honor.
not
quite,
i
think
that
the
government
may
do
whatever
it
wishes
with
its
own
territory
but
i
say
that
the
united
states
government
may
not
convey
to
a
foreign
state
any
part
of
the
sovereign
territory
of
a
state.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no
sir,
the
boundaries
of
the
states
under
the
california
and
louisiana
cases
stops
at
the
inland
waters.
the
boundary
of
a
nation
extends
for
three
miles
beyond
that.
that's
our
present
claim,
three
miles.
russia
claims
12
miles
and
the
one
thing
that
could
never
be
agreed
upon
on
this
convention
was
how
many
miles
could
a
nation
claim.
this
contention
is
silent.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
i
would
have
to
presume
that
if
congress
and
the
president
so
chose
that
they
could
do
it
as
well
as
it
did
not
infringed
upon
the
boundary
of
a
state.
i
think
it
would
be
a
disaster
to
do
it
but
i
think
that
this
i
have
to
admit
that
this
power
has
vested
in
commerce.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no,
sir.
this
court
held
in
the
first
louisiana
case
that
louisiana
did
not
own
any
of
the
three-mile
limit
that
we
stopped
at
our
inland
waters.
now,
if
you
look
at
this
next
map,
--
if
you
look
at
your
map
number
5,
you
will
see
that
there
is
a
three-mile
limit
beyond
our
inland
waters.
the
boundary
of
louisiana
stops
at
the
inland
waters.
but
the
submerged
land
act
--
the
boundary
of
a
nation
stops
at
the
three-mile
limit.
the
submerged
land
act
has
granted
to
louisiana
the
re
sources
under
the
three-mile
belt
but
i
cannot
say
that
we
actually
owned
the
water
of
the
three-mile
belt.
but
our
boundaries
are
inland
waters.
now,
we've
discussed
the
classic
definition
of
exercise
of
sovereignty.
we've
shown
that
east
bay
has
qualified
geographically
as
inland
waters
of
this
nation
since
1803
in
the
louisiana
purchase
and
since
then
louisiana
was
admitted
to
the
union
in
1812.
this
fact
alone
presupposes
that
all
kinds
of
sovereignty
were
exercised
all
these
waters.
if
it
formed
part
of
a
territorial
of
this
state
and
this
nation,
there
is
a
presumption
that
sovereignty
was
exercised
over
these
waters.
and
it
is
impossible
at
this
late
date
to
determine
every
single
act
of
sovereignty
that's
been
exercised
by
this
nation,
by
this
state,
by
the
local
authorities
and
everybody
else
but
we
will
mention
some.
now,
mr.
sachse
has
already
discussed
the
act
of
1895
as
a
basis
of
the
inland
water
line.
the
government
has
objected
to
this
and
contends
that
this
act
is
limited
to
navigation
that
it
have
no
effect
whatsoever
but
anything
else
except
navigation.
we
violently
disagree
with
that
interpretation
but
for
the
purposes
of
our
discussion
of
history
of
east
bay,
we
will
assume
that
the
government
is
right
and
that
it
is
limited
to
navigation.
now,
freedom
of
navigation
is
the
first
freedom
mentioned
in
the
convention
on
the
high
seas,
no
nation
may
regulate
navigation
on
any
part
of
the
high
seas.
to
do
so,
it
can
only
justify
it
on
the
basis
that
it
is
claiming
those
waters
as
it's
very
own.
now,
mr.
sachse
has
pointed
ut
that
prior
to
1895,
congress
had
adopted
the
international
rule
for
the
prevention
of
collisions
on
the
sea.
these
rules
applied
not
only
to
the
high
seas,
they
also
applied
to
the
marginal
or
territorial
sea.
subsequent
acts
of
congress,
treaties
and
the
case
of
the
delaware
make
this
clear.
the
international
rules
applied
to
the
high
seas
and
the
territorial
seas.
the
act
of
1895
imposed
the
inland
rules
only
upon
inland
waters.
but
it
imposed
the
inland
rules
upon
all
vessels,
foreign
as
well
as
domestic.
it
says
that
all
vessels
must
comply
with
the
inland
rules
once
they
get
into
the
inland
waters
and
it
authorize
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
designate
and
define
a
line
marking
those
inland
waters
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
that
act.
now,
the
reason
for
the
designation
of
this
line
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
the
reason
for
it
was
of
course
to
regulate
navigation.
but
the
effect
of
it
goes
beyond
that.
it
was
a
line
marking
the
inland
waters
of
this
united
states.
now,
in
1895
immediately
after
the
passing
of
the
statute,
the
secretary
of
treasury
began
his
test
of
designating
and
defining
these
lines.
he
picked
the
most
important
areas
in
the
united
states
for
his
first
lines
in
1895.
he
included
philadelphia
harbor
and
delaware
bay,
baltimore
and
chesapeake
bay,
new
york,
charleston,
savannah,
mobile
and
new
orleans
and
the
delta
of
the
mississippi
river.
among
their
first
lines
designated
in
1895,
there
had
to
be
some
lines
showing
where
our
inland,
the
inland
waters
of
this
nation
were
so
that
we
could
enforce
inland
rules
on
one
side
and
international
rules
on
the
other
side,
and
he
designated
these
lines
in
1895.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes
sir,
an
act
of
congress
of
february
1895
ought
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
it's
obvious.
i
don't
recall
the
title
of
the
statute,
your
honor.
it
did
provide
that
the
inland
rules
what
to
be
used
in
the
inland
waters
of
the
united
states
and
it
did
authorize
and
direct
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
designate
and
define
the
line
--
the
line
dividing
the
inland
waters
from
the
high
seas.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
it
is
in
one
of
these
appendices
to
our
brief,
i
have
the
title,
your
honor.
it's
--
the
title
is
“an
act
to
adopt
special
rules
for
the
navigation
of
harbors
rivers,
--
rivers
and
inland
waters
of
the
united
states
except
the
great
lakes”
supplementary
to
an
act
of
august
19,
1890
entitled
an,
“act
to
adopt
regulation
for
the
preventing
--
for
preventing
collisions
at
sea.”
this
act
was
complementary
to
the
act
of
1890
which
have
adopted
the
international
rules.
this
act
adopts
the
inland
rules.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
i
can't
answer
that
offhand,
your
honor.
we've
got
so
much
in
these
briefs.
do
you
have
it
mr.
cox?
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
that's
exactly
our
position.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
that's
one
of
our
positions.
we
say
that
irrespective
of
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
your
honor,
government
says
east
bay
is
open
seas.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
if
it
is
exercised
within
well-defined
areas
and
marked
and
is
exercised
for
a
sufficient
period
of
time,
the
answer
is
yes.
this
is
exactly
what
happened
in
norway.
norway
had
drawn
these
lines
for
fishing
purposes.
and
there
had
been
no
concept
of
straight
baseline
before
the
convention
and
the
court
held
that
they
will
--
there
were
--
historic
waters
because
norway
had
controlled
fishing
inside
those
lines.
if
we
were
to
draw
off
a
part
of
the
high
seas
and
stationed
gunboats
out
there
in
regulation
and
say
you
can't
come
in
here
unless
you
apply
--
comply
with
our
regulations
and
we
do
it
for
sufficient
period
of
time
without
objection
from
foreign
states
its
historic
waters.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
now,
the
1895
line
around
the
delta
was
defined
as
commencing
at
the
light
--
southeast
pass
jetty
light.
it
ran
thence
to
pass
(inaudible)
and
thence
to
the
(inaudible)
island
in
the
chandeleur
chain.
it
commenced
again
by
separate
description
at
south
pass
east
jetty
light
ran
of
southwest
pass
and
thence
north
to
shore.
this
description
was
published
in
the
treasury
department
circular
127
of
july
1895
and
was
also
indicated
on
the
united
states
coast
chart
194
of
that
year.
and
we
have
circled
this
in
red
and
this
map
appears
in
the
reduced
scale
in
(inaudible).
i'm
sure
you
can't
read
it
but
that's
what
it
says.
now,
this
line
enclosed
all
of
the
waters
of
the
delta
including
east
bay.
similar
lines
were
designated
again
in
1897
and
1900.
after
1900,
the
authority
was
transferred
from
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
labor.
and
in
1905
and
in
1907,
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
labor
designated
similar
lines
making
only
such
adjustments
that
were
occasioned
by
the
seaward
growth
of
the
passes.
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
labor
became
the
secretary
of
commerce.
and
in
1917,
another
line
was
designated
by
the
secretary
of
commerce.
the
lines
were
again
designated
in
1927
and
1932.
our
next
map
shows
a
composite
of
all
of
these
lines
as
well
as
in
1953,
your
honors.
at
the
time
these
lines
were
drawn,
each
and
every
one
of
them
enclosed
the
entirety
of
east
bay.
the
adjustments
in
the
lines
were
occasion
only
by
the
seaward
growth
of
those
passes.
since
1895,
that
bay
has
been
enclosed
as
inland
waters
of
this
country.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
well,
we
--
our
argument
is
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
well,
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
your
honor,
we
say
that
because
of
these
lines
that
this
makes
east
bay
an
historic
bay
which
is
accepted
from
the
treaty.
it
is
accepted
by
its
own
terms
from
the
mathematical
requirements
of
the
treaty
and
we
say
that
these
lines
marked
the
inland
waters
of
the
state
of
louisiana.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
when
did?
mr.
j.
b.
miller
1953.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
this
is
the
inland
water
line
that
mr.
sachse
discussed
yesterday.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
not
in
this
area
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
that
is
map
number
15.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
we
take
the
position
that
the
line
of
1953
is
frozen
because
louisiana
has
adopted
a
statute
declaring
as
its
boundary.
now,
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
coastguard
tried
to
change
this
line
last
year.
they
held
hearings
all
over
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
there
were
such
a
furrow,
there
were
so
many
objections
by
the
shipping
interest
and
the
people
who
had
economic
interest
in
this
area
that
they
abandoned
the
whole
project.
we
have
to
have
a
line
like
this
in
louisiana
because
of
shallow
waters,
the
small
boats,
fishermen
who
have
been
out
on
east
bay
and
outboard
motorboat
fishing.
and
the
government
says
this
is
high
seas
in
the
16-foot
motorboat.
we
can't
even
get
to
the
shores
in
louisiana
without
dredged
channels.
there
must
be
a
line
somewhere
out
there.
now,
we
say
that
these
lines
qualify
straight
baselines
under
article
4
of
the
convention
also
because
we
think
to
do
and
we
think
that
the
convention
should
be
interpreted
as
in
including
lines
such
as
these
because
this
is
necessary
for
the
state
in
this
country.
the
waters
of
louisiana
so
shallow,
there's
no
way
for
them
to
be
of
any
benefit
to
any
foreign
commerce,
they're
not
like
the
santa
barbara
channel.
the
santa
barbara
channel
is
2000
feet
deep.
we're
talking
about
waters
for
the
most
part
of
an
outboard
motorboat
has
traveled
getting
in.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no,
sir.
in
east
bay,
can
i
turn
over
to
that?
in
east
bay,
the
government
says,
the
high
seas,
this
is
the
limit
of
the
high
seas.
this
is
a
three-mile
territorial
sea.
this
line
represents
the
high
seas.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
but
the
united
states
government
does,
it
says
three
miles.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
no
sir,
the
convention
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
there
was
no
agreement
on
the
territorial
sea.
russia
claimed
12
miles.
we
claim
three
miles.
we
could
not
agree
but
the
united
states
has
consistently
asserted
three
miles
and
under
their
present
position,
this
would
make
a
substantial
part
of
east
bay
high
seas.
we
would
assert
no
plain
rule.
now,
the
acts
of
congress
and
regulations
required
that
the
inland
rules
be
used
by
all
vessels
both
foreign
and
domestic
inside
these
lines.
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
agencies
entrusted
with
the
enforcement
of
these
laws
commencing
with
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
on
up
now
to
the
coast
guard
did
in
fact
enforced
these
laws
and
the
government
doesn't
deny
that
they
did.
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
inland
rules
of
the
road
where
in
fact
enforced
inside
these
lines
both
on
domestic
vessels
and
foreign
vessels
and
the
government
doesn't
deny
that
either.
and
yet,
that's
not
a
single
instance,
there
is
not
a
single
instance
of
any
objection
by
any
foreign
nation
or
any
foreign
vessel
to
these
lines.
not
only
has
there
been
toleration
but
we
feel
that
there's
been
a
complete
acquiescence
but
this
isn't
the
end
of
the
story.
louisiana
has
exercised
sovereignty
within
these
waters.
beginning
in
1870,
louisiana
enacted
extensive
statute
regulating
the
oyster,
fishing
and
shrimping
industry.
all
of
these
statutes
have
been
applied
and
interpreted
as
applying
to
the
inland
waters
of
louisiana
including
east
bay.
oyster
leases
have
been
granted
in
east
bay.
some
of
the
shrimp
statutes
specifically
mentioned
east
bay.
arrests
have
been
made
in
east
for
the
violation
of
the
shrimping
regulations.
the
louisiana
department
of
wildlife
and
fisheries
patrolled
east
bay
in
boats
to
enforce
the
regulations.
no
questions
have
ever
been
raised
not
by
the
united
states;
no
foreign
vessel,
not
even
the
persons
who
were
arrested.
other
control
has
also
been
exercised
by
the
local
officials
of
other
activities
and
large
oil
field
is
located
at
east
bay
and
therein
lies
the
problem.
part
of
this
oil
field
extends
in
to
the
part
that
the
government
says
this
is
now
high
seas.
this
map
is
prepared
by
shell
oil
company
showing
its
facilities
in
this
area.
it's
obvious
that
the
congestion
virtually
precludes
(voice

--
any
foreign
vessels.
yes
sir,
that's
your
map
number
16.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
but
louisiana
is
not
the
only
one
has
considered
this
bay
to
be
inland
waters.
the
united
states
has
always
considered
it
to
be
inland
waters
and
in
1940
when
the
census
bureau
undertook
the
re-measurement
of
the
united
states,
they
included
all
of
east
bay
as
the
inland
waters
of
america.
this
map
shows
the
location
of
the
line
that
was
drawn
by
the
census
bureau
in
1940.
now,
the
government
we
exercise
no
sovereignty,
yet
we
control
navigation
so
there's
no
freedom
of
navigation.
we
control
fishing,
there's
no
freedom
of
fishing.
we
control
pipelines
and
air
flight
in
this
bay
also.
this
country
exercise
--
has
exercised
complete
sovereignty
over
east
bay
and
no
nation
has
ever
raised
any
objection.
they've
abided
by
laws
in
east
bay
and
all
of
the
conditions
for
historic
waters
have
been
met
not
only
from
classic
sense
of
sovereignty
but
also
from
a
legal
sense
of
geography.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
the
shell
oil
company
map
shows
that
oil
--
this
is
what
started
the
whole
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
not
now.
not
now,
your
honor,
because
under
the
convention
on
the
high
seas
this
is
granted
to
all
nations.
but
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
--
before
that
happen
it
was,
before
the
occurred
it
was.
before
the
act
--
before
mr.
truman's
proclamation
and
the
continental
shell
act
than
any
act
that
louisiana
performed
over
this
bay
was
an
act
of
sovereignty
and
we
did
grant
leases
and
that's
what
started
this
whole
litigation.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
that's
our
contention,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
the
government
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
--
contends
that
we
must
have
claimed
ownership
of
this
bay
as
part
of
the
territory
of
this
bay.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
your
honor,
we
think
you
can.
we
think
that
the
law
presumes
that
these
officials
exercised,
they
had
performed
their
duties
and
enforce
the
laws
and
the
government
doesn't
deny
that
they
enforce
the
laws
in
navigation
down
there.
they
do
not
deny
that
the
navigation
laws
were
in
fact
enforced.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
we
can
file
in
the
record
reports
of
arrest
that
had
been
made.
we
filed
in
the
record
that
oyster
leases
that
have
been
made.
maybe
we
should
ask
the
government
what
facts
they
dispute,
i
don't
know.
my
time
is
running
out,
i
want
to
cover
one
more
area
before
i
quit
and
that's
caillou
bay
which
is
in
your
map
number
21.
caillou
bay
again
serves
as
an
example
of
the
restrictive
interpretation
of
the
government.
the
government
says
that
islands
may
not
be
used
to
foreign
bays
and
yet
they
used
the
same
mass
of
islands
which
we
used
as
the
western
part
of
caillou
bay
to
form
the
adjoining
timbalier
bay.
but
they
say
these
islands
can
enclose
bays.
these
islands
are
separated
from
the
mainland
by
one
foot
of
water,
one
foot
of
water
going
to
coast
job.
the
maximum
depth
of
water
in
this
bay
is
7
feet
and
most
of
the
bay
is
about
5
to
6
feet
deep,
but
they
say
this
is
like
santa
barbara
channel.
they
say
this
is
the
same
thing
the
santa
barbara
channel
which
this
court
held
not
to
be
inland
water.
to
show
the
difference,
this
is
a
coast
chart
of
santa
barbara
channel.
we
have
reproduced
caillou
bay
at
the
same
scale
as
this
coast
chart
and
this
is
caillou
bay.
it's
a
small
i
don't
even
think
you
can
see
it.
but
this
is
caillou
bay
that
the
government
says
it's
like
the
santa
barbara
channel.
the
depth
of
water
in
caillou
bay
is
5
to
6
feet
deep.
the
depth
of
water
in
the
santa
barbara
channel
is
2000
feet
deep.
now,
this
is
a
kind
of
water
we're
talking
about
in
louisiana.
we're
talking
about
tons,
we're
not
talking
about
2000-foot
seagoing
channels
even
the
chapman
line,
even
the
chapman
line,
in
1950
drawn
by
secretary
of
the
interior
chapman
enclosed
east
bay.
as
a
result,
it
had
never
even
--
not
east
bay,
i'm
sorry
your
honor,
caillou
bay.
this
bay
has
never
been
considered
as
being
in
dispute
and
no
moneys
have
even
been
impounded,
it
was
never
regarded
as
being
disputable.
and
then
the
first
louisiana
case,
the
government
conceded
that
all
the
waters
located
situated
between
the
islands
and
the
main
lands
are
inland
water
because
the
islands
are
so
situated
as
to
enclose
inland
waters.
now,
they
say
caillou
bay
is
part
of
the
high
seas
six-foot
water
part
of
the
high
seas.
i
want
to
mention
the
dredged
channels.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
three
miles
from
the
shore.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
three
miles
from
shore.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir.
they
say
islands
may
not
be
used
under
the
convention
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
well,
fortunately
it's
within
the
three-mile
limit
but
if
it
were
not
it
would
high
seas.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
it's
territorial
sea.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
now,
i've
mentioned
the
dredged
channels
before
as
being
necessary
for
this
state
and
in
every
single
port
that
we
have
in
louisiana
including
the
port
of
new
orleans
it's
been
necessary
to
dredged
channels
in
order
to
reach
that
port
even
the
passes
at
the
river
silt
up
and
no
one
--
and
no
boats
can
get
in
without
dredged
channels.
this
is
a
dredged
channel
off
the
coast
of,
i
believe,
its
channel
of
calcasieu
and
cameron
parish.
this
dredged
channel
--
similar
dredged
channel
was
held
to
be
inland
waters
in
the
case
of
a
delaware.
this
was
getting
its
channel
in
leading
to
new
york
harbor
in
which
the
court
said,
it's
as
much
the
inland
waters
as
new
york
harbor
itself.
article
8
of
the
convention
provides
that
the
outer
most
permanent
harbour
works
which
form
an
integral
part
of
the
harbour
system
shall
be
regarded
as
forming
part
of
the
coastline.
these
are
permanent.
they're
cut
into
the
bid
of
a
gulf
of
mexico.
the
united
states
government
has
spent
over
$300
million
and
all
shores
in
louisiana
dredging
these
channels.
they
currently
spend
money
maintaining
these
channels
and
these
are
not
mere
buoy
channels.
the
earth
dredged
out
of
these
channels
as
deposited
on
the
bank
of
the
cut
in
the
form
of
a
spoiled
bank
and
it
impedes
navigation.
but
without
the
channels
no
vessel
could
navigate
beyond
a
rowboat
or
an
outboard
motorboat
or
some
other
small
type
of
boat
but
they're
not
buoy.
these
channels
are
marked
by
tremendous
steel
and
concrete
towers
that
are
sunk
in
the
bed
of
a
gulf
of
mexico
at
over
60
feet
tall.
they
are
truly
represents
the
outermost
permanent
harbour
works
which
formed
an
integral
part
of
the
harbour
system
of
louisiana
and
under
article
8
of
the
convention.
they're
part
of
the
coastline.
that
article
doesn't
--
the
government
objects
to
these
because
they
are
submerged.
that
article
doesn't
mention
anything
about
being
submerged.
it
says
permanent
harbour
works.
the
government
says
we
can't
measure
them
from
a
low
water
line.
the
convention
doesn't
say
anything
about
measuring
permanent
harbour
works
from
the
low
water
line.
the
convention
says
if
they
are
part
of
the
harbour
works,
they
are
an
integral
part
of
the
harbour
system.
they
are
regarded
as
part
of
the
coast
to
louisiana.
one
more
factor
i
want
to
mention
in
its
decree,
the
government
is
asking
that
this
court
limit
the
effect
to
this
decision
to
the
chapman
line
and
yet,
they
are
claiming
caillou
bay
beyond
the
chapman
line.
we
think
this
decree
must
settle
the
lands
underneath
navigable
waters
which
will
confirm
to
the
states
by
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes
sir,
we
need
a
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
short
time
left
to
me,
i'd
like
to
point
out
to
your
honors
that
mr.
cox
is
in
error
about
east
bay,
the
navigation
laws
that
the
united
states
published
in
1940
shows
precisely
that
east
bay
was
considered
inland
waters
of
the
united
states
at
the
time
of
its
publication
as
you'll
see
on
page
418.
he
is
in
error
also
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
navigation
laws
of
the
united
states
of
1940
published
by
the
department
of
commerce
of
the
united
states.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
it
describes
the
lines
just
as
there
had
been
described
before.
it
isn't
a
chart,
it
is
a
book.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
but
it
is
there.
he
is
in
error
in
our
opinion
in
his
reference
to
the
annapolis
which
i
think
is
so
important
in
relation
to
justice
white's
question
because
there,
the
brief
said
precisely
that
their
right
to
regulate
foreign
vessels
was
limited
to
their
own
jurisdiction
so
to
our
inland
waters.
we
think
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
justice
stewart
raised
a
proper
point
with
reference
to
the
word
“normal”
in
the
geneva
convention.
it
couldn't
have
been
put
there
meaninglessly
by
all
the
people
who
went
to
that
convention
when
the
word
“normal”
indicates
that
if
an
abnormal
situation
exists
a
different
treatment
is
to
be
accorded.
one
final
word,
the
state
department
may
have
the
right
for
our
government
to
act
in
determining
whether
our
boundary
is
three
miles,
three
leagues
or
a
greater
number
of
leagues
from
our
coast.
but
the
congress
confined
it
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
not
to
the
state
department
the
right
the
duty
to
mark
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
and
he
did
so.
and
he
did
so
by
these
lines
which
have
been
on
published
charts
for
years.
and
when
i
asked
the
commandant
of
the
coastguard
last
year
when
he
proposed
the
change
of
it
if
any,
any
foreign
government,
any
foreign
vessel,
anyone
else
had
ever
protested
that
line,
he
said
if
there
is
such
a
protest
we
will
advice
you
and
none
such
has
been
given.
we
say
--
mr.
j.
b.
miller
sir?
mr.
j.
b.
miller
yes,
sir
and
there
have
been
large
charts
which
showed
all
of
these
lines
starting
back
from
1895.
this
much
of
the
line
has
been
on
the
chart
only
since
1953
but
the
lines
marking
the
points
marking
it
had
been
there
for
many
years
designated
and
defined
by
the
same
federal
authority.
mr.
j.
b.
miller
i
would
certainly
think
so
justice
black,
if
not
it
has
not
yet
been
suggested
to
us
who
in
the
federal
government
will
do
this
if
the
agency
directed
by
congress
to
do
it
is
not
the
one
to
do
it.
thank
you,
your
honors.
