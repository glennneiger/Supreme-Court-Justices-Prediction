mr.
archibald
cox
it's
on
pages
150
and
151
of
our
opening
brief
mr.
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
will
be
helpful
in
the
beginning
if
i
go
back
to
the
fundamental
question
in
this
case.
as
we
see
it,
the
ultimate
question
is,
where
is
the
coastline
of
the
united
states
located
in
the
general
area
of
louisiana
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act?
the
exact
location
of
the
coastline
is
important
because
the
submerged
lands
act
confirmed
to
each
state,
the
title
to
the
resources
not
only
up
to
the
coastline
but
also
for
three
miles
beyond.
and
consequently
while
we're
fighting
about
where
the
line
is
three
miles
beyond
the
coastline
that
is
necessary
determined
by
the
location
of
the
coastline
itself
and
it's
more
convenient
to
talk
directly
about
the
location
of
the
coastline.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
say
that
the
coastline
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act
means
the
coastline
of
the
united
states.
yes,
sir.
the
two
--
the
two
would
be
the
same
for
all
purposes
that
so
far
as
i
can
think
but
we
do
mean
for
international
purposes
justice
stewart
and
that's
why
i
emphasize
the
coastline
of
the
united
states.
now,
section
2
(c)
of
the
submerged
lands
act
defines
the
coastline
as
the
line
of
ordinary
low
water
along
the
coast
which
is
indirect
contact
with
the
open
sea
and
the
line
marking
the
seaward
limit
of
inland
waters.
there's
no
dispute
of
course
about
first
part
of
the
definition
in
this
case.
that
is
to
say
the
low
water
marked
along
the
coast
where
the
coast
is
in
contact
with
the
open
sea.
although,
louisiana
denies
that
their
coast
is
ever
in
contact
with
the
open
sea.
the
critical
question
then
is
about
the
second
part
of
the
definition
in
2
(c)
of
the
submerged
lands
act
whereas
the
line
marking
the
seaward
limit
of
inland
waters.
in
other
words,
what
are
the
inland
waters
of
louisiana
and
where
is
their
seaward
limit.
now,
in
answering
this
question,
the
first
step
is
to
determine
where
one
finds
the
definition
of
inland
waters.
where
one
finds
the
standard
that
he
applies
to
the
physical
features
of
this
coast
in
order
to
find
the
inland
waters.
our
view
is
that
you
find
it
in
the
convent
--
geneva
convention
of
1961
defining
the
territorial
sea
and
the
adjacent
waters.
louisiana's
answer
is
that
you
find
it
--
our
first
answer
is
that
you
find
it
in
the
regulations
issued
by
the
coastguard
for
the
purpose
of
telling
vessels
where
they
are
to
follow
the
international
rules
in
navigation
and
where
they
are
to
follow
our
own
domestic
inland
rules
of
navigation.
the
difference
is
our
illustrator
on
this
chart
and
also
on
the
small
charts
which
i
believe
the
clerk
has
handed
to
each
member
of
the
court.
the
green
area
is
the
area
that
was
confirmed
to
the
united
states
by
the
decree
entered
late
in
1965
a
supplemental
decree
which
was
virtually
by
consent.
in
other
words,
it
is
the
area
more
than
three
miles
from
the
coastguard
line.
the
red
areas
here,
a
little
bit
here
and
then
a
bit
over
here
and
another
area
in
east
bay
are
the
areas
that
were
confirmed
to
louisiana
by
the
supplemental
decree
entered
in
late
in
1965.
the
pink
area
we
concede
goes
to
louisiana,
there's
no
dispute
about
it.
consequently,
one
comes
down
on
to
the
white
area
between
green
and
the
pink
or
red,
this
long
strip
in
here,
sometimes
20
miles
of
the
physical
coast.
the
dispute
is
over
that
area.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
in
all
cases.
it
became
red
for
several
reasons.
it
became
red
partly
because
in
more
accurate
surveys
than
had
been
available
at
the
time
the
interim
agreement
was
drawn
--
drawn
up
and
it
became
red
partly
as
a
result
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
california
case
which
is
you
will
recall
rejected
some
of
our
claims
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
inland
waters.
this
is
particularly
true
if
my
memory
is
right
in
the
atchafalaya
bay
area.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
it
wouldn't
be
white
if
it
were
not
red.
it
would
still
be
in
dispute.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
pink
area
we
now
concede.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
oh!
it's
being
--
i'm
sorry.
we
concede
it
belongs
to
louisiana
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
it's
the
territorial
sea.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
is
not.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
within
three
miles
from
the
coastline.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
some
instances
from
inland
waters,
in
some
instances
from
the
shore,
yes.
this
map
in
other
words
justice
white
is
a
map
that
deals
in
terms
of
boundaries
not
in
terms
of
the
coastline.
now,
i
should
make
one
other
point
about
the
map.
back
in
the
pink
line,
there
is
a
lot
of
white
area
which
is
of
course
water.
that
goes
to
louisiana
too
because
it's
never
been
any
dispute
about
it.
there've
been
no
funds
impounded
from
it
and
consequently
we
didn't
think
it's
worth
coloring
on
the
map.
mr.
archibald
cox
these
white
areas.
mr.
archibald
cox
those
clearly
are
inland
waters.
i
didn't
want
the
fact
that
they
were
white
to
mislead
the
court.
now,
so
the
first
issue
in
the
case
deals
with
the
entire
white
area
outside
the
pink
and
red
lines
and
these
were
about
the
coastguard
line
will
determine
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
the
coastguard
line
doesn't
really
--
hardly
shows.
if
you
look
sharp
you'll
see
about
three
quarters
of
an
inch
inside
the
yellow
line.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
three
miles
from
that
dotted
line
as
the
coastguard
line.
i
come
next
i
think
into
answering
the
question
that
was
bothering
you
justice
brennan.
the
second
part
of
the
case
that
is
assuming
that
we
are
right,
that
the
coastguard
line
is
not
controlling.
the
second
part
of
the
case
then
concerns
--
we
would
then
get
the
white
area
outside
the
blue
line
and
that
would
be
clear.
the
second
part
of
the
case
involves
the
area
inside
(voice
overlap)
between
it
and
the
pink
and
red.
in
other
words,
louisiana
says
they
own
out
to
that
blue
line
under
the
submerged
lands
act,
under
their
alternative
potentials
whereas
we
say
they
don't
go
beyond
what
is
pink
or
red.
mr.
archibald
cox
with
their
variance
on
the
geneva
convention,
yes.
so
that
in
the
second
part
of
the
case
what
you
have
is
a
series
of
disputes
about
specific
areas
within
the
same
years
coming
out
then
again
this
area
here
again
here
caillou
bay,
another
application
here
get
a
ground
each
of
these
east
bay
and
so
on.
now,
there
are
series
of
specific
disputes
about
the
meaning
and
application
of
the
convention
and
really
have
to
be
worked
through
one
by
one
of
those
certain
common
questions
applied.
now,
i
planned
to
devote
the
first
part
of
my
argument
to
the
question
of
the
coastguard
line.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
in
other
words,
the
seaward
limit
in
their
primary
claim
is
the
orange.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
edge
of
the
green.
mr.
archibald
cox
three
miles,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
precisely.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
so
these
are,
maybe
tremendous
is
too
strong,
but
they're
very
large
distance
is
these
27
miles.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
say
that
the
sea
never
comes
within
20
miles
--
20
miles
at
spot,
15,
10
and
others
of
the
shore
of
louisiana.
as
i
say,
i
plan
to
deal
first
with
the
coastguard
line
and
then
second
was
that
of
the
more
specific
disputes
as
i
have
tied
to.
with
respect
to
the
coastguard
line,
we
urge
first
that
united
states
against
california
should
be
decisive.
there,
the
court
held
that
congress
used
the
terms
“coastline”
and
“inland
waters”
in
the
international
sense
as
in
it
had
used
to
be
in
prior
decisions
of
this
court
notably
the
first
california
case.
second,
that
congress
intended
the
court
to
fill
out
the
meaning
of
inland
waters
in
coastline
by
choosing
the
best
in
those
practicable
definitions.
and
then
third,
the
court
held
that
the
best
and
most
practical
definition
where
those
in
the
geneva
convention
ratified
by
the
united
states
in
1961.
now,
those
three
rulings
seem
to
us
dispositive
of
the
issue
of
these
white
areas.
louisiana
argues
as
i
understand
it
that
the
decision
in
the
california
case
was
merely
sort
of
permissive,
a
state
could
assert
a
right
out
to
the
line
fixed
under
the
convention
or
it
could
if
it
wish
assert
a
line
out
under
some
other
set
of
rules
going
beyond
the
convention.
that
seems
to
us
to
be
inconsistent
of
both
with
what
the
court
said
in
the
california
case
and
also
inconsistent
with
what
it
actually
did
in
its
decree.
in
the
california
case,
on
page
165
of
381
u.s.,
the
court
said
it
is
our
opinion
that
we
best
fulfill
our
responsibility
by
giving
content
to
the
words
which
congress
implied
that's
of
course
implied
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
by
imply
--
adopting
the
best
and
most
workable
definitions
available
the
convention
provides
such
definitions.
we
adopt
them
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act
then
the
court
went
on
to
point
out,
this
establishes
a
single
coastline
both
for
the
fenestration
of
the
submerged
lands
act
in
the
conduct
of
our
future
relation.
this
certainly
doesn't
sound
permissive.
it
establishes
a
single
coastline
where
you
adopt
this
definition.
it
doesn't
sound
as
if
they
were
to
be
used
on
some
occasions
and
then
not
on
others
if
the
state
happened
to
prefer.
and
of
course
the
court
later
on
its
opinion
rejected
california's
claim
to
santa
monica
bay
and
to
san
luis
obispo
bay
on
the
ground
that
they
did
not
conform
to
the
requirements
of
the
convention.
so,
that
it
applied
it
both
where
it
heard
us
as
some
of
you
will
recall
in
monterey
bay
and
it
applied
the
convention
too
where
it
heard
california
as
in
san
luis
obispo
bay
and
santa
monica
bay.
when
it
came
to
the
decree
which
the
court
entered
following
the
decision
in
the
california
case,
it
being
on
the
original
document,
the
decree
were
cited
as
used
here
in
inland
waters
means
i
emphasized
the
“means”,
means
what
is
landward
of
the
baseline
of
the
territorial
sea
which
are
now
recognized
as
internal
waters
of
the
united
states
under
the
convention
on
the
territorial
sea
and
the
contiguous
zone.
the
word
“means”
surely
suggests
that
there
were
no
alternatives.
furthermore,
on
the
next
paragraph
of
the
decree
where
the
court
listed
certain
waters
that
it
adjudicated
to
be
inland
waters
of
california.
it
used
the
word
that
the
inland
waters
of
california
include
specific
areas
that
were
in
litigation
in
that
case.
obviously,
it
didn't
wish
to
prejudge
california's
claim
as
to
areas
we
didn't
talk
about
in
that
case
are
belonged
to
northern
part
of
the
coast.
i
think
again
the
contrast
between
“includes”
in
this
paragraph
and
“means”
in
the
other
paragraph
emphasizes
that
the
word
“means”
when
adopting
a
general
formula
was
deliberate
and
indeed
at
least
the
“includes”
point
was
pointed
out
in
the
supplemental
briefs
of
the
decree.
louisiana's
other
argument
as
i
understand
it
is
that
united
states
against
california
does
not
apply
because
her
coast
has
unique
features.
of
course
the
characteristics
of
all
the
coasts
in
states
are
in
some
degree
peculiar.
the
alaska
coast
is
entirely
unlike
the
north
carolina
coast
or
the
maine
coast
is
entirely
unlike
the
louisiana
coast,
connecticut
coastline
would
be
quite
different
from
oregon's
and
so
forth.
if
one
said
that
a
state
may
get
out
from
under
the
convention
simply
by
calling
attention
to
particular
characteristics,
then
every
state's
coastline
is
drawn
off
with
litigation.
the
very
purpose
of
the
california
case
to
have
the
same
coastline
for
international
purposes
and
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act
would
be
defeated
and
the
court
and
the
congress
indirectly,
i
suggest,
would
be
put
in
the
position
of
playing
favorites
among
the
states
as
it
used
the
convention
rules
in
one
case
and
some
other
set
of
rule
and
another.
so,
we
think
as
i
say
that
the
california
decision
is
controlling.
i
should
in
that
connection
mention
once
more
point,
there
are
coastguard
lines.
there
are
some
of
the
bays
in
california
was
not
along
the
whole
coast
as
there
is
here
in
louisiana.
neither
party
in
the
california
case
thought
had
appropriate
to
invoke
those
lines.
they
might've
been
invoked
on
both
parties
thought
that
they
were
irrelevant
and
we
so
stated
to
the
court
as
i
remember
it
during
oral
argument
mentioning
the
existence
of
the
lines.
moving
along,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
no
and
of
course
mr.
justice
black,
there
never
was
any
complete
coastline
drawn
in
louisiana
until
after
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed.
alright,
the
line
has
vary
from
time
to
time
at
some
times
it
is
right
along
the
east
side
of
the
delta
here
down
on
the
east
side
of
the
delta.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
either,
to
begin
with
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
one
states
the
bureau
of
navigation,
and
ultimately
it
came
to
the
coastguard.
but
this
whole
expands
here
that
they
now
rely
on
wasn't
drawn
until
after
the
submerged
lands
act
was
adopted.
it
didn't
exist
at
the
time
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed.
indeed,
at
the
time
the
submerged
lands
act
has
passed,
louisiana's
chart
didn't
mention
that.
the
line
didn't
even
include
this
bay.
it
ran
a
little
bit
up
here
down
around
the
chandeleur
island
and
then
down
roughly
where
the
edge
of
the
green
is
now,
it
isn't
precise
but
it
was
roughly
there.
and
that
was
the
only
line
from
1935
until
1953
appeared
of
almost
20
years
according
to
our
study
of
the
record.
so,
that
the
line
louisiana
now
is
invoking
was
promulgated
after
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed.
mr.
archibald
cox
under
the
1895
statute,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
with
changes
due
to
the
re-governmental
reorganization
but
it
was
basically
the
1895
statute.
now,
we
say
that
even
as
an
original
question
for
getting
the
california
case
thereon
that
the
coastguard
line
would
be
utterly
unacceptable
as
the
definition
of
inland
waters
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
in
order
to
put
the
two
in
proper
relation,
i
think
it's
important
that
i
go
back
and
give
a
little
bit
of
explanation
of
the
history
of
the
legislation
dealing
with
the
coastguard
line
and
the
various
lines
that
have
been
promulgated
from
time
to
time
under
that
legislation.
mr.
archibald
cox
to
a
few
very
brief
references,
yes.
i
can
elaborate
from
now
or
do
it
a
minute
later
after
i
have
--
i
have
it
firmly
in
mind
to
refer
the
court
to.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
1864,
congress
enacted
a
statute
later
incorporated
from
the
revised
statutes
that
promulgated
certain
rules
of
the
road
navigation
rules
for
all
united
states
vessels
anyone
the
kind
of
statute
that
justice
fortas
referred
to
applicable
earlier,
applicable
to
vessels
sailing
the
high
seas.
and
this
applied
to
both
naval
vessels
and
to
the
merchant
marine.
in
the
1880's,
there
were
series
of
international
conferences
on
rules
of
navigation
and
they
came
out
not
with
the
treaty
but
with
recommendations
to
the
nations
that
participated
in.
in
1890,
congress
enacted
a
new
statute
which
required
all
u.s.
vessels
upon
the
high
seas
and
in
all
waters
connected
therewith
navigable
by
seagoing
vessels
to
follow
the
new
international
rules.
that
was
to
take
effect
some
years
later
and
in
the
end
of
all
it
became
apparent
that
there
was
going
to
be
some
confusion
because
the
old
statute
adopting
the
inland
rules
still
applied
somewhere
and
the
new
statute
still
apply
to
some
vessels
somewhere.
in
1895,
having
been
advised
to
this
problem
but
congress
enacted
the
statute
that
we're
talking
about
it
appears
on
pages
150
and
151
of
the
government's
brief.
it
said
that
the
old
1864
rules,
the
inland
rules
should
be
followed
on
inland
waters
and
then
it
went
on
in
section
2
and
the
power
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
that's
the
authority
that
it
is
comes
down
to
the
commandant
of
the
coastguard,
empowered
him
from
time
to
time
to
designate
and
define
by
suitable
bearings
or
ranges
with
lighthouses,
light
vessels,
buoys
or
coast
objects
the
lines
dividing
the
high
seas
from
rivers,
harbors
and
inland
waters.
the
title
of
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
what
it
means
that
the
secretary
later
the
commandant
of
the
coastguard
is
to
provide,
is
to
define
where
the
rules,
inland
rules
are
to
apply
and
where
the
international
rules
are
to
apply.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
his
or
his
definition
is
binding
for
the
purposes
of
the
statute
to
be.
mr.
archibald
cox
binding
for
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
binding
for
the
purposes
of
navigational
rule.
mr.
archibald
cox
just
rules,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
to
be
done
for
a
specific
purpose
as
provided
in
the
title
of
the
act
on
page
150,
an
act
to
adopt
special
rules
for
the
navigation
of
rivers,
harbors,
inland
waters
of
the
united
states
and
that
was
the
only
purpose
ever
explain.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
certainly
is
a
line
for
the
purposes
of
this
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
for
the
purposes
of
navigation,
yes.
but
it
wasn't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
two
points
and
i'm
going
to
develop
them
in
a
moment
justice
black
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
at
considerably
more
length.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i'd
be
happy
to
indicate.
mr.
archibald
cox
first,
we
think
that
it
is
most
implausible
for
reasons
that
i
will
state
to
suppose
that
this
act
authorize
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
define
the
territorial
limits
of
the
united
states
for
international
purposes.
second
we
say,
even
if
the
act
should
be
construed
as
having
told
in
to
lay
out
these
lines
in
terms
of
where
our
boundary
for
international
purposes
was.
he
finally
has
never
done
it,
he
finally
has
never
purported
to
do
it,
he
finally
has
never
tried
to
do
it
and
we
say
consequently
he
hasn't
done
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
line
was
a
line
like
which
the
secretary
thought
and
later
the
commandant
of
the
coastguard
thought
would
be
a
good
line
to
mark
the
place
where
you
shift
it
from
the
international
rules
to
the
inland
rules.
and
he
had
said
so
over
and
over
again
that
that
was
the
only
thing
he
was
doing.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
history
is
covered
on
--
beginning
at
page
26
of
our
brief
and
running
on
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
sir.
and
running
on
to
page
41.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
was
first
made
by
the
coastguard
in
a
publication
in
1943
referred
to
on
page
33
of
our
brief,
toward
the
bottom
of
the
page.
the
coastguard
admiralty
law
enforcement
manual
and
that
begins
by
explaining
what
is
meant
by
inland
waters
and
high
seas
in
the
international
or
territorial
sense.
and
then
it
goes
on
and
says
navigation
rule.
now,
it
was
consider
another
line
of
demarcation.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
on
page
33
of
my
brief.
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
let
us
consider
another
line
of
demarcation,
something
other
than
the
line
for
international
purposes.
as
shown
in
chapter
5,
there
are
different
rules
for
navigation
on
the
inland
waters
in
the
high
seas
but
here
we
do
not
apply
the
previous
definition
but
adopt
a
new
one
for
a
convenience.
secretary
of
commerce
has
fixed
the
series
of
lines
and
so
forth.
going
over
on
page
34,
quite
obviously
this
artificial
line
does
not
truly
separate
the
high
seas
from
the
inland
waters
of
the
united
states.
it
simply
marks
the
area
within
which
the
inland
rules
apply
and
outside
of
which
the
international
rules
control.
then,
and
you
find
this
repeated
in
the
coastguard
publications
over
and
over
again.
i
call
attention
to
perhaps
the
most
significant
of
all.
in
1953,
when
the
commandant
for
the
first
time
promulgated
any
line
along
the
part
of
the
area
from
here
to
here,
well,
for
the
first
time
from
here,
he
said,
in
putting
out
that
regulation
that
it
was
drawn
solely
for
purposes
connected
with
navigation
in
shipping.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
page
34.
and
not
to
define,
not
for
the
purpose
in
defining
federal
and
state
boundaries
nor
to
define
or
describe
federal
or
state
jurisdiction
over
navigable
water.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
was
in
1953.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
was
after
the
enactment
of
the
submerged
lands
act
and
in
the
instrument
drawing
this
line
which
you
will
recall
was
drawn
after
the
enactment
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
except
that
it
was
consistent
with
the
disclaimers
that
have
been
stated
ever
since
the
very
beginning
justice
stewart.
let
me
refer
to
one
more
illustration.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
first
explicit
disclaimer
and
i'll
indicate
what
i
mean
by
explicit
in
a
few
minutes.
the
first
explicit
disclaimer
that
we
have
reference
to
came
from
the
assistant
secretary
of
state
and
it's
quoted
on
page
38
of
our
brief.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh!
this
was
back
in
the
1920's
excuse
me
i
should've
stated.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
was
the
assistant
secretary
of
state
and
the
circumstances
were
these,
the
norwegian
government
was
putting
together
materials
for
the
purpose
of
trying
before
the
international
court
of
the
famous
norwegian
fisheries
case.
so,
they
rode
around
the
world
asking
everyone
to
provide
evidence
with
respect
to
--
of
where
he
in
that
country
defined
its
territorial
boundaries.
and
the
secretary
of
state
circulated
the
departments
and
collected
everything.
they
collected
among
other
things
from
the
treasury
department
references
to
where
the
various
coastguard
lines.
and
he
explained
in
the
letter,
i
don't
quote
it
off
but
he
explained
in
part
of
it,
the
different
departments
had
adopted
different
rules
for
the
purposes
in
the
united
states
and
sent
the
coastguard
regulations
among
them
and
then
after
that
he
went
on
and
said
and
this
is
the
part
i
rely
on
particularly.
it
should
be
understood
that
the
foregoing
lines
do
not
represent
territorial
boundaries
but
are
for
navigational
purposes
to
indicate
where
the
inland
rules
begin
and
the
international
rules
seize
to
apply
but
there
again
there's
a
clear
recognition
of
the
very
limited
purpose
of
these
definitions
under
the
act
of
1895.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
there
is
some
question
whether
they
are
valid
within
that
area.
the
coastguard
takes
the
position
that
they
are
valid
even
though
that
is
not
inland
waters
and
in
some
part
of
course
is
not
territorial
sea.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
raises
that
question,
i
would
think
if
the
court
would
not
pass
judgment
upon
it
or
that
being
answer
in
two
steps.
first,
we
do
think
it
most
unlikely
that
the
1895
statute
was
ever
intended
to
give
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
a
power
to
fix
the
territorial
limits
of
the
united
states.
it
just
seems
inherently
impossible
that
in
a
little
act
dealing
with
navigation,
a
section
would've
been
put
in
the
only
explanation
was
that
it
was
done
at
the
request
in
shipping
interest
in
new
york
harbor
and
that
it
would
be
for
this
limited
purpose.
we
just
think
inherently
impossible
that
congress
would
have
said
the
secretary
has
now
fixed
the
territorial
limits
of
the
united
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
strange
first
that
it
would've
been
given
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
second,
that
it
was
strange
that
it
would
be
given
simply
in
an
act
entitled,
an
act
to
fix
the
rules
of
navigation.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
of
course
the
international
--
questions
of
international
law
that
determine
the
territorial
boundaries
of
the
united
states
are
primarily
under
the
department
of
state.
i
think
that
it
is
quite
likely
and
then
there's
one
more
point
about
the
act.
of
course
it
provides
that
the
secretary
shall
do
it,
shall
issue
these
regulations
from
time
to
time.
this
doesn't
sound
like
fixing
territorial
boundaries
for
international
purposes.
you
don't
make
them
fix
territorial
boundaries
for
international
purposes
from
time
to
time.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand
your
honors
references.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
we
asserted
our
jurisdiction
over
the
resources.
we
didn't
purport
to
change
the
boundaries
in
terms
of
the
freedom
of
the
seas,
as
i
understand
it.
we
said
that
we
were
entitled
of
the
resources
on
the
continental
shelf
but
we
didn't
purport
to
change
our
boundaries
in
reference
to
the
high
seas.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
we
don't
--
we
were
asserting
authority
under
it
and
i
suppose
to
structures
that
came
up
my
interfere
with
navigation
although
there's
always
been
a
privilege
to
a
restructures
in
the
high
seas
for
lighthouses,
and
other
things
of
that
kind
without
there
becoming
part
of
the
territory
of
the
united
states.
that
in
any
event
today
is
covered
by
international
convention.
but
let's
--
it's
quite
possible
i
think
well
then
what
was
contemplated
immediately
was
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
would
be
guided
by
the
territorial
boundaries
and
that
he
was
instructed
for
the
convenience
of
navigation
not
to
fix
them
but
to
find
them.
but
i
suggest
two
different
things,
one
is
to
apply
the
international
rules
and
translate
them
into
buoys,
lighthouses
and
a
like,
and
the
other
thing
is
to
determine.
but
a
point
of
fact
as
i
have
suggested
whatever
the
original
intention
was
neither
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
nor
anyone
else
has
ever
done
this
in
terms
of
the
international
law.
from
the
very
beginning,
this
we'd
elaborate
in
our
brief,
the
rules
have
been
laid
down
in
ways
that
do
not
conform
either
of
this
country
or
any
other
countries
conceptions
of
international
law.
they
run
to
lighthouses,
they
take
in
large
areas
especially
of
the
main
coast
from
the
beginning
or
charleston
harbor
in
south
carolina
which
we're
not
conceivably
inland
waters
under
international
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
on
the
--
no
and
of
course
we've
taken
positions
in
international
conference
after
international
conference
quite
inconsistent
without
saying
that
this
is
international
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
indeed,
mr.
justice
so
far
as
anyone
knows
we
have
never
asserted
as
against
any
ship
flying
the
flag
of
another
nation
nor
applied
in
any
admiralty
procedure
involving
a
ship
of
another
nation.
well,
the
inland
rules
because
of
the
collision
or
sailing
in
this
area,
i
don't
--
i
can't
say
that
the
coastguard
both
hasn't
ever
hailed
to
foreign
vessel
neither
can
anyone
say
that
it
can
but
so
far
as
this
goes
it
is
a
paper
thing.
but
--
mr.
archibald
cox
so
far
as
i
know
and
of
course
and
this
is
important
on
many
aspects
of
the
case.
of
course,
as
against
our
own
nation
there
is
under
securities
in
florida,
a
clear
power
to
regulate
fishing,
shrimping,
navigation
rules
or
anything
else.
now,
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
take
it
they
undoubtedly
do
and
i
take
it
that
we
have
the
power
to
ask
them
to
do
it
and
if
they
acquiescence,
well
then
that's
that.
furthermore
--
mr.
archibald
cox
they
along
the
side
of
this
line
it
says
use
inland
rule.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
they
no
doubt
do
conform.
now,
there
are
two
--
well,
i'm
just
speaking
about
the
status
of
the
rules
today.
first,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
under
louisiana's
view
and
under
any
view
of
justice
white
that
the
validity
or
effectiveness
of
these
rules
depends
upon
these
big
inland
waters
in
the
international
sense.
they
are
plainly
invalid
today
because
the
geneva
convention
as
of
today
plainly
fixes
rules
inconsistent
with
the
inland
rules.
i
and
that
convention
which
we
have
ratified
and
undoubtedly
takes
preceding
over
anything
the
coastguard
has
done.
so
that
the
rules
cannot
be
sustained
today
on
the
theory
that
they
somehow
are
fixing
the
territorial
boundaries
of
the
united
states
in
the
international
sense,
they're
bound
to
be
invalid
under
that
theory.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
then
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but
the
question
--
they
are
fixing
what
if
they're
to
be
limited
for
only
domestic
purposes
that
is
to
say
they
apply
only
to
our
vessels.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
that
is
in
the
international
question.
that's
what
the
boundary
of
the
country
is
an
international
question.
that's
what
one
means
by
the
boundary
of
the
country
and
that
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
was
the
original
historical
derivation
of
the
rule,
yes.
the
theory
was
that
the
three-mile
limit
was
a
cannon
shot
from
shore.
now,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
you
have
decided
the
case
on
that
subject.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
seems
to
me
that
the
reasons
behind
it
are
very
sound.
i
just
want
to
give
one
more
answer
to
justice
white
and
then
i
will
come
directly
to
that
point.
alright,
there
are
decisions,
justice
white,
particularly
the
english
case
of
indianapolis
which
suggest
that
a
nation
has
the
power
to
set
a
rules
in
navigation
requirements
of
navigation
for
vessels
approaching
or
leaving
their
ports
and
if
that,
i
don't
want
to
overstate
that
line,
if
that
is
sound
law
and
the
coastguard
relies
on
it,
as
i
understand
it,
then
that
would
validate
these
rules
simply
as
the
requirements
of
navigation
because
for
all
practical
purposes
the
only
vessels
coming
in
here
are
going
to
foreign
vessels
coming
in
here
are
going
to
be
foreign
vessels
going
to
the
ports
of
louisiana.
now,
i
come
to
the
question
raised
by
justice
fortas,
what
about
section
2
(c)
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
we
say
that
it
cannot
have
meant
the
inland
water
line
as
laid
down
by
the
coastguard
or
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
for
number
of
reasons.
first,
the
evidence
is
very
persuasive
that
the
term
was
used
in
the
international
sentence
in
reference
to
a
general
body
of
international
law.
this
was
the
flavor
of
the
debate.
there
are
specific
references
to
the
courts
used
of
the
term
in
the
early
california
case
where
it
clearly
indicated
that
it
referred
to
use
it
in
the
international
sentence.
and
there
is
specific
legislative
history
which
justice
harlan
asked
me
about
earlier
with
respect
to
the
coastguard
line.
there
was
testimony
from
leander
perez
of
the
delta
area
and
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
louisiana
which
referred
to
the
coastguard
line.
remembering
that
time,
this
line
did
not
exist.
indeed,
under
the
regulations
that
out
east
bay
wasn't
even
behind
the
coastguard
line.
and
this
was
referred
too
in
the
testimony
pretty
much
i
think
in
passing
at,
did
i
say
hearings
on
the
submerged
lands
act,
if
i
did
i
was
wrong.
it
was
referred
to
two
congresses
earlier
at
hearings
on
previous
bills.
then,
the
matter
was
brought
up
again
during
the
hearings
before
the
interior
committee
of
the
senate
on
the
bills
that
became
the
submerged
lands
act.
and
senator
anderson
cut-in
and
said,
well,
we've
been
all
through
that
and
we
found
that
that
line
won't
help
us.
well,
that
was
the
end
of
the
discussion.
i
added
of
course
that
a
number
of
reasons
it
might
not
help
but
what
happened
was
that
it
affected
very
little
in
the
coast.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
most
unlikely
that
congress
intended
to
give
some
official
then
the
coastguard
power
to
draw
the
lines
that
would
be
decisive
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
core
of
our
position
with
respect
to
the
coastguard
line
comes
down
to
these
three
sentences.
first,
that
when
congress
spoke
of
the
coastline
or
inland
waters
in
the
submerged
lands
act
it
used
those
terms
with
reference
to
international
law
and
the
territorial
boundaries
of
the
united
states.
second,
that
whatever
may
be
said
about
the
original
purposes
of
the
act
of
1895
or
the
meaning
of
the
original
instructions
to
the
commandant
of
the
coastguard
or
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
that
he
has
not
for
years
defined
a
line
in
terms
of
international
law
or
the
territorial
boundaries
of
the
united
states.
and
consequently,
the
submerged
lands
act
was
talking
about
one
thing,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
the
commandant
were
talking
about
another
thing,
and
that
other
thing
is
irrelevant
for
the
purposes
of
this
statute.
“inland
waters”
isn't
the
word
i
might
add
that
invariably
must
have
one
meaning.
louisiana
and
the
statute
enacted
in
1948
defined
the
term
“inland
waters”
to
cover
only
waters
where
the
tide
have
been
flowed
and
excluded
all
others
from
that.
we
don't
argue
that's
the
meaning
of
inland
waters
for
the
purposes
of
submerged
lands
act.
i
simply
show
that
this
means
that
this
term
like
others
must
be
construed
with
reference
to
its
context
and
what
was
intended
to
be
done.
i
move
on
therefore
to
the
second
part
of
the
case
to
the
areas
behind
the
blue
line
which
is
louisiana's
outermost
alternate
plan
and
offshore
of
the
red
or
pink
which
we
concede
to
louisiana.
our
position
is
that
the
status
of
those
waters
is
to
be
determined
by
applying
the
geneva
convention
in
a
practical
commonsense
manner
in
accordance
with
its
terms
and
that
if
something
does
not
qualify
as
inland
waters
under
the
convention
that
it
is
not
inland
waters
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act
and
that
this
is
true
of
all
our
coast
and
therefore
specifically
true
of
the
coast
of
louisiana.
now,
in
that
connection
i
think
it's
worth
looking
at
the
geneva
convention
and
calling
attention
to
a
few
things
in
support
of
my
proposition
that
it's
intended
to
be
universal
and
exclusive.
and
since
we
omitted
to
print
the
full
text
that
may
be
fairer
to
use,
the
text
is
printed
by
louisiana
which
is
in
the
appendix,
the
third
volume
of
their
briefs
beginning
at
page
127.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
first
to
article
3
on
page
128.
limits
of
the
territorial
sea,
except
as
otherwise
provided
in
these
articles,
the
normal
baseline
for
measuring
the
breadth
of
the
territorial
sea
is
the
low
water
line
along
the
coast
is
marked
on
the
large
scale
official
chart.
so
that
unless
one
can
bring
himself
within
an
exception
elsewhere
provided
in
these
articles
is
low
water
--
is
the
coastline
is
the
line
along
the
coast,
the
low
water
line
along
the
coast
is
marked
on
the
large
scale
official
chart.
i
--
we're
not
this
explicit
that
that
is
the
line
except
is
provided
elsewhere
in
the
articles.
less
any
question
arise,
i
should
call
attention
to
the
word
“normal”
which
it
seems
to
us
quite
clear
in
this
connection
means
the
line
according
to
rule,
the
line
according
to
standard
and
not
some
word
like
“generally
or
ordinarily
or
usually.”
this
is
very
clear
from
the
history
at
one
stage
without
attempting
to
quote
exactly
the
predecessor
of
article
3
did
include
words
like
“generally”
and
the
word
“normal”
baseline
was
in
the
title.
then
for
the
specific
and
explained
purpose
of
making
it
clear
that
there
was
no
discretion
except
as
provided
in
the
convention.
those
words
“generally
or
usually”
were
strict
and
the
explanation
was
given
that
the
purpose
of
the
convention
was
to
provide
an
exclusive
uniform
set
of
rules.
alright,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
i
think
it
means
according
to
standard,
according
to
rule
and
i
point
out
that
this
through
many
versions
did
not
have
normal
in
it.
the
word
“normal”
was
put
in
only
by
the
drafting
committee
and
only
when
it
was
decided
to
give
up
titles.
and
for
some
reason
it
was
put
in
that
and
i
think
it
simply
means
the
baseline
according
to
rule.
it's
in
other
words
the
drafting
committee
would've
been
authorized
to
make
such
a
major
exception.
alright,
now
there
are
other
articles
that
make
it
quite
plain
that
the
convention
was
defining
the
territorial
sea
and
contiguous
zone
in
the
coastline
both
inclusively
and
exclusively.
mr.
archibald
cox
absolutely
and
i
think
the
history
shows
that
without
any
question.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
convention
was
to
establish
a
uniform
set
of
rules
applicable
to
all
nations.
indeed,
another
incident
that
tends
to
show
this
justice
stewart
at
one
time
there
was
an
effort
in
the
proprietary
drafts
to
state
what
was
international
law
and
then
new
proposal
separately,
and
it
was
decided
that
this
should
not
be
done
because
there
wasn't
enough
agreement
on
what
was
international
law,
and
that
the
only
way
to
get
rules
eliminating
everyone's
discretion
was
to
set
them
down
in
a
treaty
that
everyone
would
adopt.
another
indication
was
pointed
out
this
morning,
this
agreement,
this
treaty
does
not
define
the
breadth
of
the
territorial
sea
it
leaves
that
to
each
nation.
and
the
draftsmen
were
very
careful
to
avoid
saying
its
three
miles
leaving
anybody
to
claim
more
if
he
wanted
to
so
as
to
leave
the
question
what
is
the
breadth
of
the
territorial
sea,
of
course,
we
have
always
taken
the
position
that
it's
no
more
than
three
miles.
article
7
as
i
say
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
would
--
mr.
archibald
cox
geneva
just
defines
where
it
stops.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
it
leaves
it
up
--
excuse
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true
and
i
think
that
we
would
not
recognize
the
texas
three
leagues
for
international
purpose.
we
have
to
recognize
them
for
rights
in
the
continental
shelf
but
not
for
international
purposes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
was
history
boundary
of
texas
as
used
in
the
submerged
lands
act
but
of
course
it
was
found
that
louisiana's
history
boundary
did
not
go
out
three
leagues.
yes,
but
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
the
united
states
chose
to
say
three
leagues
it
would
not
be
in
some
cases,
it
would
not
be
in
violation
of
the
geneva
convention.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
it
doesn't
decide
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
that's
correct.
and
what
i
was
stating
was
not
our
interpretation
of
the
convention
but
what
i
understand
the
position
of
the
state
department
to
be.
i
was
saying
article
7
not
only
defines
a
bay
by
inclusion
but
by
exclusion.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
they're
certainly
referred
to
baselines
from
time
to
time
and
i'm
not
sure
whether
they
do
or
whether
they
don't
i
thought
i
heard
mr.
sachse
yesterday
that
they
didn't
but
as
i
read
their
brief
they
from
time
to
time
say
that
the
coastguard
line
should
be
regarded
as
straight
baseline.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
no,
because
we
have
always
assert
and
the
state
department
has
always
asserted
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
policy
of
this
government
to
draw
of
straight
baselines.
mr.
archibald
cox
permits,
correct.
we've
never
drawn
straight
baselines
also
there
are
some
places
perhaps
where
we
could.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
because
the
geneva
convention
says
that
a
straight
baseline
shall
be
the
boundary
where
it
has
been
drawn
in
certain
ways
and
as
justice
harlan
said
in
the
california
case,
the
united
states
hasn't
drawn
any
straight
baselines.
and
therefore,
there
are
no
straight
baselines
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
one
had
been
drawn
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but
it's
not
for
the
court
to
settle
that
question
of
foreign
policy
whether
we
should
or
shouldn't
exercise
the
permission.
if
that
something
of
if
the
nation
does
as
a
matter
of
foreign
policy.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but
unless
yes.
but
unless
the
government
elects
to
draw
straight
baselines,
the
territorial
seas
starts
at
the
other
points
defined
in
the
geneva
convention
if
the
government
does
elect
to
draw
a
straight
baseline
that
it
starts
there.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
say
that
the
united
states
which
is
a
litigant
which
is
also
concerned
with
its
foreign
policy
has
the
option
of
deciding
whether
to
draw
a
straight
baseline.
this
was
adjudication.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that's
the
effect
of
our
position.
it
isn't,
we
state
something
that
is
much
more
important
than
that.
it's
been
a
foreign
part
of
the
foreign
policy
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true
but
i
suggest
that
if
this
court
should
say
that
we
elect
to
draw
straight
baselines
that
that
would
have
a
very
important
and
unfortunate
effect
on
the
policy
that
the
state
department
has
been
consistently
followed.
if
the
court
does
it,
the
state
department
will
have
to
deliver
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i've
tried
to
say
i
would
honestly
that
i
wasn't
clear
about
louisiana's
position
on
that
and
i
can't
say
that
there
is
none.
we
say
that
there
is
none.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
i
think
they
do
make
the
suggestion
that
justice
white
made
it.
it
slipped
my
mind
that
maybe
the
court
should
draw
some
baselines
which
we
object
to
for
the
reason
i've
stated.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
and
i
would
further
answer
that
the
court
has
already
decided
that
in
the
california
case.
i
was
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
have
the
language
directly
in
front
of
me
but
there
is
a
passage
in
justice
harlan's
opinion
that
recognizes
that
only
the
united
states
and
apparently
speaking
in
terms
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
can
draw
straight
baselines
and
it
has
elected
to
draw
none
and
therefore
since
straight
baselines
were
not
applicable
on
the
decision
of
that
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
thought
he
was
referring
to
it
of
course
it
might
refer
to
the
legislative
branch
too.
yes,
i
was
but
not
the
judicial
branch.
page
168
of
381
u.s.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
arguing
that
the
exclusive
rules
must
be
found
within
the
convention
that
it
is
to
solve
the
terms
of
what
is
the
coastline
of
the
united
states
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
i
want
to
emphasize
some
of
the
implications
of
what
i
was
saying
so
that
can
be
no
mistaken
of.
first,
i
imply
that
arguments
based
on
geological
phenomena
or
economic
uniqueness
are
irrelevant
either
in
general
or
as
applied
to
specific
instances
because
the
convention
that
deals
with
one
might
call
cartographic
phenomena,
the
thing
shown
on
the
charts
of
merit
and
other
considerations
are
irrelevant
under
it.
second,
i
implied
that
the
mere
former
theories
of
the
united
states
with
respect
to
international
law,
the
rule
as
to
bays
or
rule
as
to
islands
and
so
forth
which
we
have
from
time
to
time
advanced
are
no
longer
applicable
because
the
matter
has
been
frozen
in
the
convention
and
specifically
louisiana's
arguments
that
under
some
rule
espoused
by
the
state
department
at
periods
in
our
history
before
the
geneva
convention
is
simply
irrelevant
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
just
as
our
theory
with
respect
to
monterey
bay
of
the
10-mile
bay
that
was
held
in
the
california
case
to
be
irrelevant
because
it
was
simply
something
that
we
had
propounded
prior
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
submerged
lands
act
but
was
not
embodied
in
the
convention.
next,
i
specifically
mean
to
imply
the
point
i
touched
upon
before
that
there
is
no
basis
for
claiming
straight
baselines
under
article
4
because
neither
the
congress
nor
the
executive
branch
has
ever
promulgated
straight
baselines
under
article
4.
certainly,
there
has
been
none
by
the
president
or
department
of
state,
the
commandant
would
hardly
be
the
appropriate
official
but
we
don't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
he
has
not
done
it
we
say
and
we
say
that
for
several
reasons.
first,
when
he
put
out
his
lines
he
expressly
said
he
was
not
claiming
anything
for
territorial
purposes.
so,
we
can't
have
been
promulgating
straight
baseline
under
article
4.
second,
the
line
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
he
drew
the
line
three
miles
in
shore,
this
yellow
line,
for
the
purposes
of
the
finding
the
rules
where
the
--
which
rules
of
road
should
apply,
yes.
he
certainly
did
that.
his
line
even
if
he
had
attempted
to
draw
it
as
a
straight
baseline
under
article
4
would
be
invalid
for
two
reasons.
and
the
first
is
no
one
can
argue
that
this
hard
can
impose
as
deeply
indented
or
cut
into
or
has
a
realm
of
islands
along
it
within
the
language
of
article
4
which
limits
the
places
where
you
can
draw
straight
baseline.
second,
article
4
limits
the
points
between
which
you
can
draw
a
straight
baseline
and
they
don't
include
buoys,
light
ships
and
rangers
bearing
an
underwater
shows
and
things
of
that
kind.
so
that
it's
clear
again
that
he
couldn't
have
done
it
even
if
he
was
trying
and
of
course
what
he
did
quite
plainly
wasn't
that
effort.
the
fourth
thing
that
i
mean
to
imply
by
saying
that
the
convention
applies
in
these
leagues
exclusive
standard
is
that
it
is
a
very
sharp
limitation
on
or
both
historic
bays
and
the
evidence
that
will
constitute
in
historic
bay.
first,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
section
6
of
article
7
applies
only
to
historic
bays.
it
doesn't
speak
of
other
historic
waters.
it's
historic
bays
and
one
therefore
must
have
something
in
the
nature
of
the
bay
before
this
exception
would
possible
imply.
but
the
kinds
of
evidence
that
will
be
sufficient
to
constitute
on
historic
bay
are
very
limited
by
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
suppose
that
the
state
must
assert,
we
are
claiming
this
as
our
territory.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
that
it
was
satisfied
by
saying
we
are
drawing
this
line
and
claiming
that
all
the
waters
behind
it
are
our
inland
water.
but
i
think
that
it
must
make
at
least
that
the
state
that
draws
it
is
giving
notice
to
all
the
world
that
it
is
claiming
it
as
it
waters
and
of
course
the
state
--
the
coastguard
has
always
indicated
that
we
weren't
claiming
as
our
waters.
all
that
it
is
said
is
you
should
follow
our
inland
rules
asserted
the
limited
purposes
and
not
a
claim
i
think
it's
our
territorial
sea.
now,
the
other
point
i
was
going
on
to
make
was
a
that
the
kind
of
evidence
that
is
necessary
to
show
a
bay
to
be
in
historic
bay
is
limited
to
active
assertions
of
jurisdiction
doing
something
to
somebody
by
the
coastal
state
usually
coupled
with
some
kind
of
acquiescence
by
the
others.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
mean
in
the
international
sense
and
indeed
we
argue
that
in
a
state
in
our
sentence
one
of
the
50
states
is
not
sufficient,
but
i
don't
have
to
rest
on
that
point
here
anymore
than
we
had
to
rest
on
it
from
the
california
case.
because
the
evidence
that
louisiana
invokes
here
for
the
purposes
of
claiming
historic
bays
rather
plainly
fails
to
meet
the
test
of
anybody
actively
asserting
jurisdiction.
certainly,
the
advancing
of
abstract
theories
of
international
law
that
other
nations
didn't
accept
that
we're
not
settled
international
law
without
ever
applying
them
to
particular
areas
cannot
be
regarded
as
the
necessary
kind
of
assertion
of
jurisdiction
to
constitute
in
historic
bay.
even
more
clearly,
old
maps
like
a
commerce
department
map
to
which
you
were
referred
this
morning
which
were
drawn
for
limited
purposes
do
not
constitute
an
assertion
of
jurisdiction
as
against
other
states
in
the
international
sense.
statutes
in
louisiana
purporting
to
regulate
the
taking
of
shrimp
or
oysters
or
natural
resources,
i
and
ostensibly
applicable
in
these
waters
are
not
sufficient
as
the
court
held
in
the
california
case
because
they
do
not
involved
an
actual
as
enforcement
of
jurisdiction
against
a
foreign
nation.
now,
louisiana
--
the
only
specific
things
louisiana
refers
to
anywhere.
our
series
of
criminal
prosecution
under
some
of
their
natural
resources
laws,
there
are
three
answers
to
those
points.
first,
so
far
as
we
know
all
of
those
offenses
under
louisiana
law
may
well
have
been
committed
within
the
territorial
sea,
the
three-mile
strip
within
the
bay.
some
of
them,
one
can
tell
for
the
records,
where
within
that
three-mile
strip.
second,
all
of
the
defendants
so
far
as
the
instances
they
gave
us
were
concerned
were
residence
of
louisiana
and
therefore
presumably
citizens
of
louisiana
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
(inaudible)
and
florida,
louisiana
has
the
power
to
regulate
their
conduct
on
the
high
seas
just
as
much
as
anywhere
else.
and
the
third
point
i
mentioned
earlier
and
that
is
that
what
one
of
our
50
states
does
in
our
view
is
irrelevant.
now,
against
the
background
of
those
generalizations,
i'd
like
to
take
what
time
i
can
on
some
of
the
specific
areas
that
are
in
controversy.
we're
talking
now
about
material
between
blue
lines
and
the
pink
or
red
and
i
start
at
the
west
edge
of
louisiana
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
they
did.
i
would
say
that
drawing
of
a
line
with
the
statement
we
are
not
exercising
sovereignty,
we
are
doing
it
for
a
limited
purpose
is
not
an
acceptable
assertion
of
jurisdiction
because
we're
saying
we're
not
asserting
territorial
jurisdiction
over
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
indicated
that
the
question
of
whether
we
could
enforce.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
of
course
we
never
did
assert
it
and
actually
apply
it
and
as
a
pronouncement
we
almost
limit.
so
that
what
it
is,
i
insists
or
suggests
isn't
anything
more
that
it
purports
to
be
of
which
was
his
statement?
we
want
and
perhaps
the
statement
we
will
require
you
to
follow
our
inland
rules.
now,
this
was
never
challenged,
there's
been
no
violation
that
was
tested
in
the
court
so
there
was
occasion
in
admiralty
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it's
not
if
limited
to
the
mere
statement
we
will
require
you
to
follow
and
it
was
never
applied
to
anyone.
i
would
think
that
was
not
an
adequate
assertion
of
jurisdiction
because
there's
been
no
bringing
it
there.
actually,
so
far
as
i
can
see
the
only
error
where
this
come
into
play
that
is
that
east
bay
because
that's
the
only
thing
that
could
be
call
it
bay
and
that
is
why
i
don't
mean
a
strict
bay
but
a
bay
in
loose
sense
and
this
area
certainly
can
never
be
called
a
historic
bay.
there's
no
bay
about
that
and
article
7
paragraph
6
is
limited
to
bay.
alright,
i
was
about
to
start
at
the
west
end
of
the
coastline
and
take
the
segment
which
runs
from
sabine
pass
here
to
take
their
point
which
is
on
the
coast
about
here.
you'll
know
that
both
that
our
line
and
louisiana's
line
when
it
applies
the
convention
follows
the
coast
except
for
these
fingers
reaching
out,
curiously
they
even
reach
out
into
the
area
that's
already
been
adjudicated
to
be
ours.
those
are
the
inland
--
dredged
channels
to
which
mr.
miller
referred
this
morning
and
which
louisiana
claims
our
part
of
her
coast
under
the
convention.
these
channels
appeared
down
here
at
sabine
lake
in
calcasieu
pass
and
that
fresh
water
bayou,
but
there
are
other
points
along
the
coast
where
such
channels
exist
and
consequently
this
is
a
recurrent
problem
and
it
seemed
well
to
deal
with
it
at
the
outset.
now,
first
i
must
point
out
that
louisiana's
statement
on
page
336
of
the
brief
that
the
congressional
history
of
the
submerged
lands
act
clearly
shows
that
both
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
considered
dredged
ship
channels
to
be
part
of
the
inland
waters
of
the
united
states
is
not
accurate.
the
facts
are
these,
the
history
does
show
that
at
one
stage
the
senate
committee
on
interior
and
insular
affairs
considered
and
there
was
in
the
bill
a
definition
of
inland
waters
which
include
all
estuaries,
ports,
harbors,
bays,
channels,
straights,
historic
bays,
and
sounds
whether
this
included
dredged
channels
or
not
is
anyone's
guess.
my
guess
would
be
that
it
use
channels
in
the
sense
of
the
english
channel
or
some
other
body
of
water
between
an
island
and
the
mainland
rather
than
something
just
leading
out
of
perhaps
20
miles
into
the
ocean
but
i
can't
say
that
i'm
right
but
it
certainly
doesn't
give
i'm
as
right
as
they
are.
the
next
thing
that
is
clear
is
that
this
language
was
deliberately
struck
out
of
the
bill
in
an
effort
to
leave
the
definition
of
inland
waters
entirely
to
court.
so
that
no
one
can
infer
that
there
was
any
intention
to
include
these
errors
and
we
come
to
consider
the
question
therefore
like
all
other
questions
in
terms
of
the
geneva
convention.
the
question
turns
on
article
3
and
8
of
the
convention.
article
3,
we
noted
before
except
for
where
other
was
provided
in
these
articles
the
normal
baseline
for
measuring
the
breadth
of
the
territorial
sea
is
the
low
water
line
along
the
coast.
now,
i
ask
you
keeping
that
in
mind
the
low
water
line
along
the
coast
to
jump
to
article
8
which
begins
at
the
very
bottom
of
page
106
in
the
louisiana
appendix
for
the
purpose
of
delimiting
the
territorial
sea,
the
outermost
permanent
harbour
works
which
form
an
integral
part
of
the
harbour
system
shall
be
regarded
as
forming
part
of
the
coast.
so
that
the
question
we
have
asked
ourselves
is
whether
a
dredged
channel
leading
out
from
a
port
is
a
part
of
the
permanent
harbour
works
within
the
meaning
of
article
8.
we
submit
that
such
a
channel
even
though
marked
by
aids
to
navigation
of
buoys
and
some
places,
day
beacons,
lighthouses
and
alike
is
not
part
of
the
permanent
harbour
works
that
the
term
harbour
works
refers
only
to
raise
installations
like
piers
and
jetties
and
breakwaters
which
also
a
man-made
are
physical
part
of
the
coast.
i
rest
that
conclusion
on
several
things.
the
first
place
i
don't
think
just
a
matter
of
the
ordinary
use
of
words
what
would
normally
think
of
a
dredged
channel
or
a
channel
that's
not
been
dredged
that
leads
out
from
a
part
was
covered
by
a
river
as
part
of
the
harbour
works
it
seems
to
me
an
extraordinary
use.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
say
that
those
were
like
any
lighthouse
on
a
reef
of
shore
and
both
prior
decisions
show
that
those
are
not
part
of
our
territory
and
the
discussion
was
in
the
convention
shows
that
a
lighthouse
was
not
treated
to
be
treated
as
part
of
the
territory
of
the
literal
state
unless
it
was
fixed
to
the
shore.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
never
gets
up
above
the
water
or
if
it
does
it
isn't
connected
to
the
coast.
it's
all
underwater.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
when
i
say
coast,
i
mean
land
or
physical
structures
above
water.
i
suppose
that
if
you
were
underneath
you
could
find
some
connection.
but
it's
by
coast
we
mean
the
land
above
water
and
this
is
not
above
water.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
these
were
banks
which,
and
that
by
banks
i
mean
that
something
that
was
consistently
continuously
above
the
water
reaching
out
from
the
coast
then
we
would
have
a
harder
time.
but
they
aren't
(voice
overlap)
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
how
do
i
think
you
would,
sir?
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
anyone
contends
that
there's
banks
that
run
continuously
above
the
sea
level.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
certainly
i
don't
understand
mr.
miller
to
be
saying
that,
i
am
prepared
to
assert
that
they
do
not.
i'm
not
prepared
to
assert
that
some
little
pile
of
earth
doesn't
occasionally
get
up.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
you
should
say
that
an
area
of
water
is
not
to
be
assimilated
under
article
7
to
something
that
is
spoken
of
as
permanent
harbour
works
performing
part
of
the
coast
because
the
coast
means
in
the
convention
and
in
usage
in
this
area
something
above
water
if
the
notion
was
to
make
these
water
areas
part
of
the
inland
waters.
the
place
to
have
dealt
with
that
was
in
the
sections
on
bays
or
inland
waters,
the
most
likely
place
to
have
dealt
with
it
would
be
in
the
area
of
roadsteads
because
there
the
convention,
this
is
in
the
article
9.
there,
the
convention
was
dealing
with
areas
of
water
of
the
coast
in
the
sense
there's
something
above
the
land.
and
the
convention
said
that
while
we
will
make
this
part
of
the
territorial
sea,
they
didn't
even
make
some
inland
waters.
we
make
them
part
of
the
territorial
sea
even
though
they
lie
more
than
three
miles
of
shore
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
had
been
any
intention
to
treat
these
areas
of
water
with
their
lighthouses,
towers,
the
distant
points
along
them
as
belonging
somehow
to
the
literal
state
that
that
was
the
place
to
have
done
it.
now,
there
was
a
proposal
to
make
buoyed
channels,
didn't
say
anything
about
whether
they
were
dredged
or
not.
to
make
buoyed
channels,
i
gave
them
the
same
status
as
roadsteads
and
the
international
law
commission
rejected
that
which
we
think
while
not
conclusive
points
in
the
direction
of
a
showing
and
confirming
the
inference
that
i
would
otherwise
draw
that
these
water
areas
were
not
assimilated
to
something
that
it
is
above
water.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but
one
finds
article
8
saying
that
that
shall
be
regarded
as
forming
part
of
the
coast.
now
i
suggest
that
treating
it
as
part
of
the
coast
strongly
suggest
that
the
draftsman
had
in
mind
things
above
the
water.
otherwise,
it
would've
been
extra
ordinary
to
say
that
something
that
is
nothing
but
a
water
area
shall
be
treated
as
if
it
were
something
out
of
what.
that
doesn't
seem
to
being
an
exceedingly
odd
way
to
come
out
and
the
history
i
refer
to
i
suggest
confirms
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
are
--
there
are
lights
that
go
out
without
halfway.
mr.
archibald
cox
some
are
buoys,
some
are
tripods.
the
water
isn't
very
deep.
they're
not
connected
to
one
another.
they're
just
like
to
many
lights
and
fixed
buoys
or
fixed
lights
along
the
new
england
coast.
mr.
archibald
cox
unless
they
were
somehow
connected
above
the
water.
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
like
as
frequent
as
the
hundred
yards
and
they
are
essentially
we
say
like
many
aids
to
navigations
that
nations
have
put
in
the
high
seas
maintain
lighthouses,
they
have
certain
privilege
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes.
well,
it
would
be
very
hard
for
other
--
for
vessels
of
any
size
to
get
into
that
harbor
i
presumably
there
might
still
be
a
harbor.
there
certainly
would
be
inland
waters
up
in
this
area.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
i
would
say
they
were
built
to
give
vessels
of
greater
draft
that
could
previously
get
in
access
to
the
harbor
like
other
dredging.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
say
harbour
system
means
fixed
structures
above
the
water.
i
don't
--
for
one
thing
remember
we're
talking
about
something
there
can
be
a
low
water
line
on
and
you
can't
have
a
low
water
line
out
an
area
sticking
way
out
here.
it's
a
physical
impossibility.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
thought
a
great
deal
about
that
justice
harlan
and
i'd
like
to
divide
my
answer
into
several
parts
always
directing
myself
i
think
to
your
question.
first,
it's
entirely
clear
to
me
that
the
initial
issue
or
the
effect
of
the
coastguard
line
should
be
resolve
by
the
court
now.
second,
there
a
very
considerable
number
of
other
issues
which
can't
be
elucidated
by
any
further
factual
evidence
and
i
think
those
should
be
decided
by
the
court
now.
also,
i
recognized
that
it
might
be
of
some
aid
to
the
court
or
to
have
an
experience
master
and
expert
master
go
through
them
and
we
know
them
out.
but
despite
that,
i
am
very
sure
they
would
all
be
back
here
with
as
long
brief
and
much
the
same
argument
if
we
all
live
long
enough
that
the
court
would
be
here
and
they
would
be
back
far
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
--
the
reason
i
was
going
to
say
as
against
the
advantages
of
sending
it
to
a
master
from
the
court's
point
of
view
in
terms
of
the
total
administration
of
justice
if
this
case
went
to
a
master
with
nothing
decided
with
the
coastguard
line,
no
one
would
know
what
evidence
to
put
in
and
what
evidence
not
to
put
in,
and
the
result
of
course
would
be
everybody
would
dump
in
all
the
evidence
that
he
could
find
and
i
think
the
total
effect
would
be
a
worst
morass
and
that
the
court
would
have
it
all
back
in.
now,
the
last
part
of
my
answer,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
that
there
are
some
points
that
the
argument
where
there
appeared
to
be
some
questions
of
fact.
i
don't
think
those
are
real
questions
put
on
the
face
of
the
briefs
they
seem
to
be
here.
i
do
think
that
if
the
court
were
to
do
the
work
of
resolving
the
questions
of
law
now
that
it
would
turn
out
that
there
were
no
significant
factual
differences
among
it.
so,
on
the
whole,
by
urging,
my
recommendation
is
that
the
court
must
face
a
large
number
i
think
all
of
these
questions
but
i
don't
want
to
pretend
that
isn't
the
difficult
matter
of
balance.
what
i
do
want
to
urge
very
strongly
is
that
authorities
be
given
--
will
be
given
all
the
guidance
and
that
the
master
be
given
if
the
court
decides
to
send
it
to
master.
all
the
guidance
it
can
that
is
i
think
the
question
i've
been
talking
about
is
one
that
can
be
resolve
here.
i
don't
think
this
and
many
of
the
other
questions
can
be
resolve
here
if
there
remain
some
others
then
at
least
we
can
get
part
of
the
money
distributed
but
we
could
focus
on
specific
issues
in
the
subsequent
proceeding.
and
i
think
it
would
be
more
efficient
way
to
administer
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
he
was
two
minutes
and
perhaps
he'll
enlighten
you,
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
they're
all
within
three
miles
of
the
coastline.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
we
interpret
the
coastline.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
let's
look
at
this
maybe
we
can
see
it
better
on
the
smaller
one.
the
reason
is
that
remember
when
you
draw
the
coastline,
you
swing
a
three-mile
arc
dot
it
from
any
low
tide
elevation.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
but
it's
not
so
much
the
islands
here
as
it
is
low
tide
elevations
within
three
miles
of
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
i
don't
know
whether
i'm
trespassing
too
much.
we
do
stick
with
it
as
we
don't
claim
this.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
at
one
time.
mr.
archibald
cox
alright,
at
one
time
the
state
department
was
asserted
that
a
realm
of
islands
within
perhaps
six
miles
or
later
perhaps
10
miles
of
each
other
an
area
like
this
did
enclose
inland
waters.
this
was
the
position
that
the
united
states
in
1953.
until
the
decision
in
the
california
case
the
view
of
the
government
was
that
we
should
apply
the
position
of
the
state
department
in
1953.
so,
we
find
it
here.
now,
we'd
learned
two
things
later.
first,
that
that
wasn't
the
international
law
but
it
was
our
claim
that
it
wasn't
the
international
law;
and
second,
that
we
weren't
governed
by
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
1953
but
by
the
geneva
convention
as
the
court
held
in
the
california
case.
other
result
was
that
there
was
nothing
more
than
that
we
would've
apply
the
geneva
conventions
but
a
lot
of
things
can
happen.
we
had
said
the
opposite
to
this
court
and
the
court
relied
on
it.
we
had
--
there
had
been
leasing
and
people
had
relied
on
it
and
we
repeatedly
doubt
with
louisiana
in
this
term
and
it
seem
to
me
that
it
was
not
suitable
becoming
for
the
united
states
having
gone
that
far
to
suddenly
say
well
we
made
a
mistake,
we're
sorry
we
led
you
all
into
this
but
we
insist
now
and
backing
out.
so,
we
think
it's
a
purely
practical
matter
while
we
did
it,
we're
stuck
with
it
and
we
ought
to
live
by
it.
and
it's
on
that
basis
and
no
rule
of
international
law
--
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
on
pages
150
and
151
of
our
opening
brief
mr.
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
will
be
helpful
in
the
beginning
if
i
go
back
to
the
fundamental
question
in
this
case.
as
we
see
it,
the
ultimate
question
is,
where
is
the
coastline
of
the
united
states
located
in
the
general
area
of
louisiana
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act?
the
exact
location
of
the
coastline
is
important
because
the
submerged
lands
act
confirmed
to
each
state,
the
title
to
the
resources
not
only
up
to
the
coastline
but
also
for
three
miles
beyond.
and
consequently
while
we're
fighting
about
where
the
line
is
three
miles
beyond
the
coastline
that
is
necessary
determined
by
the
location
of
the
coastline
itself
and
it's
more
convenient
to
talk
directly
about
the
location
of
the
coastline.
mr.
archibald
cox
we
say
that
the
coastline
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act
means
the
coastline
of
the
united
states.
yes,
sir.
the
two
--
the
two
would
be
the
same
for
all
purposes
that
so
far
as
i
can
think
but
we
do
mean
for
international
purposes
justice
stewart
and
that's
why
i
emphasize
the
coastline
of
the
united
states.
now,
section
2
(c)
of
the
submerged
lands
act
defines
the
coastline
as
the
line
of
ordinary
low
water
along
the
coast
which
is
indirect
contact
with
the
open
sea
and
the
line
marking
the
seaward
limit
of
inland
waters.
there's
no
dispute
of
course
about
first
part
of
the
definition
in
this
case.
that
is
to
say
the
low
water
marked
along
the
coast
where
the
coast
is
in
contact
with
the
open
sea.
although,
louisiana
denies
that
their
coast
is
ever
in
contact
with
the
open
sea.
the
critical
question
then
is
about
the
second
part
of
the
definition
in
2
(c)
of
the
submerged
lands
act
whereas
the
line
marking
the
seaward
limit
of
inland
waters.
in
other
words,
what
are
the
inland
waters
of
louisiana
and
where
is
their
seaward
limit.
now,
in
answering
this
question,
the
first
step
is
to
determine
where
one
finds
the
definition
of
inland
waters.
where
one
finds
the
standard
that
he
applies
to
the
physical
features
of
this
coast
in
order
to
find
the
inland
waters.
our
view
is
that
you
find
it
in
the
convent
--
geneva
convention
of
1961
defining
the
territorial
sea
and
the
adjacent
waters.
louisiana's
answer
is
that
you
find
it
--
our
first
answer
is
that
you
find
it
in
the
regulations
issued
by
the
coastguard
for
the
purpose
of
telling
vessels
where
they
are
to
follow
the
international
rules
in
navigation
and
where
they
are
to
follow
our
own
domestic
inland
rules
of
navigation.
the
difference
is
our
illustrator
on
this
chart
and
also
on
the
small
charts
which
i
believe
the
clerk
has
handed
to
each
member
of
the
court.
the
green
area
is
the
area
that
was
confirmed
to
the
united
states
by
the
decree
entered
late
in
1965
a
supplemental
decree
which
was
virtually
by
consent.
in
other
words,
it
is
the
area
more
than
three
miles
from
the
coastguard
line.
the
red
areas
here,
a
little
bit
here
and
then
a
bit
over
here
and
another
area
in
east
bay
are
the
areas
that
were
confirmed
to
louisiana
by
the
supplemental
decree
entered
in
late
in
1965.
the
pink
area
we
concede
goes
to
louisiana,
there's
no
dispute
about
it.
consequently,
one
comes
down
on
to
the
white
area
between
green
and
the
pink
or
red,
this
long
strip
in
here,
sometimes
20
miles
of
the
physical
coast.
the
dispute
is
over
that
area.
mr.
archibald
cox
not
in
all
cases.
it
became
red
for
several
reasons.
it
became
red
partly
because
in
more
accurate
surveys
than
had
been
available
at
the
time
the
interim
agreement
was
drawn
--
drawn
up
and
it
became
red
partly
as
a
result
of
the
decision
of
this
court
in
the
california
case
which
is
you
will
recall
rejected
some
of
our
claims
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
inland
waters.
this
is
particularly
true
if
my
memory
is
right
in
the
atchafalaya
bay
area.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
it
wouldn't
be
white
if
it
were
not
red.
it
would
still
be
in
dispute.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
pink
area
we
now
concede.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
oh!
it's
being
--
i'm
sorry.
we
concede
it
belongs
to
louisiana
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
it's
the
territorial
sea.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
is
not.
mr.
archibald
cox
it's
within
three
miles
from
the
coastline.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
some
instances
from
inland
waters,
in
some
instances
from
the
shore,
yes.
this
map
in
other
words
justice
white
is
a
map
that
deals
in
terms
of
boundaries
not
in
terms
of
the
coastline.
now,
i
should
make
one
other
point
about
the
map.
back
in
the
pink
line,
there
is
a
lot
of
white
area
which
is
of
course
water.
that
goes
to
louisiana
too
because
it's
never
been
any
dispute
about
it.
there've
been
no
funds
impounded
from
it
and
consequently
we
didn't
think
it's
worth
coloring
on
the
map.
mr.
archibald
cox
these
white
areas.
mr.
archibald
cox
those
clearly
are
inland
waters.
i
didn't
want
the
fact
that
they
were
white
to
mislead
the
court.
now,
so
the
first
issue
in
the
case
deals
with
the
entire
white
area
outside
the
pink
and
red
lines
and
these
were
about
the
coastguard
line
will
determine
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
the
coastguard
line
doesn't
really
--
hardly
shows.
if
you
look
sharp
you'll
see
about
three
quarters
of
an
inch
inside
the
yellow
line.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
three
miles
from
that
dotted
line
as
the
coastguard
line.
i
come
next
i
think
into
answering
the
question
that
was
bothering
you
justice
brennan.
the
second
part
of
the
case
that
is
assuming
that
we
are
right,
that
the
coastguard
line
is
not
controlling.
the
second
part
of
the
case
then
concerns
--
we
would
then
get
the
white
area
outside
the
blue
line
and
that
would
be
clear.
the
second
part
of
the
case
involves
the
area
inside
(voice
overlap)
between
it
and
the
pink
and
red.
in
other
words,
louisiana
says
they
own
out
to
that
blue
line
under
the
submerged
lands
act,
under
their
alternative
potentials
whereas
we
say
they
don't
go
beyond
what
is
pink
or
red.
mr.
archibald
cox
with
their
variance
on
the
geneva
convention,
yes.
so
that
in
the
second
part
of
the
case
what
you
have
is
a
series
of
disputes
about
specific
areas
within
the
same
years
coming
out
then
again
this
area
here
again
here
caillou
bay,
another
application
here
get
a
ground
each
of
these
east
bay
and
so
on.
now,
there
are
series
of
specific
disputes
about
the
meaning
and
application
of
the
convention
and
really
have
to
be
worked
through
one
by
one
of
those
certain
common
questions
applied.
now,
i
planned
to
devote
the
first
part
of
my
argument
to
the
question
of
the
coastguard
line.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
in
other
words,
the
seaward
limit
in
their
primary
claim
is
the
orange.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
edge
of
the
green.
mr.
archibald
cox
three
miles,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
precisely.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
so
these
are,
maybe
tremendous
is
too
strong,
but
they're
very
large
distance
is
these
27
miles.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
say
that
the
sea
never
comes
within
20
miles
--
20
miles
at
spot,
15,
10
and
others
of
the
shore
of
louisiana.
as
i
say,
i
plan
to
deal
first
with
the
coastguard
line
and
then
second
was
that
of
the
more
specific
disputes
as
i
have
tied
to.
with
respect
to
the
coastguard
line,
we
urge
first
that
united
states
against
california
should
be
decisive.
there,
the
court
held
that
congress
used
the
terms
“coastline”
and
“inland
waters”
in
the
international
sense
as
in
it
had
used
to
be
in
prior
decisions
of
this
court
notably
the
first
california
case.
second,
that
congress
intended
the
court
to
fill
out
the
meaning
of
inland
waters
in
coastline
by
choosing
the
best
in
those
practicable
definitions.
and
then
third,
the
court
held
that
the
best
and
most
practical
definition
where
those
in
the
geneva
convention
ratified
by
the
united
states
in
1961.
now,
those
three
rulings
seem
to
us
dispositive
of
the
issue
of
these
white
areas.
louisiana
argues
as
i
understand
it
that
the
decision
in
the
california
case
was
merely
sort
of
permissive,
a
state
could
assert
a
right
out
to
the
line
fixed
under
the
convention
or
it
could
if
it
wish
assert
a
line
out
under
some
other
set
of
rules
going
beyond
the
convention.
that
seems
to
us
to
be
inconsistent
of
both
with
what
the
court
said
in
the
california
case
and
also
inconsistent
with
what
it
actually
did
in
its
decree.
in
the
california
case,
on
page
165
of
381
u.s.,
the
court
said
it
is
our
opinion
that
we
best
fulfill
our
responsibility
by
giving
content
to
the
words
which
congress
implied
that's
of
course
implied
in
the
submerged
lands
act.
by
imply
--
adopting
the
best
and
most
workable
definitions
available
the
convention
provides
such
definitions.
we
adopt
them
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act
then
the
court
went
on
to
point
out,
this
establishes
a
single
coastline
both
for
the
fenestration
of
the
submerged
lands
act
in
the
conduct
of
our
future
relation.
this
certainly
doesn't
sound
permissive.
it
establishes
a
single
coastline
where
you
adopt
this
definition.
it
doesn't
sound
as
if
they
were
to
be
used
on
some
occasions
and
then
not
on
others
if
the
state
happened
to
prefer.
and
of
course
the
court
later
on
its
opinion
rejected
california's
claim
to
santa
monica
bay
and
to
san
luis
obispo
bay
on
the
ground
that
they
did
not
conform
to
the
requirements
of
the
convention.
so,
that
it
applied
it
both
where
it
heard
us
as
some
of
you
will
recall
in
monterey
bay
and
it
applied
the
convention
too
where
it
heard
california
as
in
san
luis
obispo
bay
and
santa
monica
bay.
when
it
came
to
the
decree
which
the
court
entered
following
the
decision
in
the
california
case,
it
being
on
the
original
document,
the
decree
were
cited
as
used
here
in
inland
waters
means
i
emphasized
the
“means”,
means
what
is
landward
of
the
baseline
of
the
territorial
sea
which
are
now
recognized
as
internal
waters
of
the
united
states
under
the
convention
on
the
territorial
sea
and
the
contiguous
zone.
the
word
“means”
surely
suggests
that
there
were
no
alternatives.
furthermore,
on
the
next
paragraph
of
the
decree
where
the
court
listed
certain
waters
that
it
adjudicated
to
be
inland
waters
of
california.
it
used
the
word
that
the
inland
waters
of
california
include
specific
areas
that
were
in
litigation
in
that
case.
obviously,
it
didn't
wish
to
prejudge
california's
claim
as
to
areas
we
didn't
talk
about
in
that
case
are
belonged
to
northern
part
of
the
coast.
i
think
again
the
contrast
between
“includes”
in
this
paragraph
and
“means”
in
the
other
paragraph
emphasizes
that
the
word
“means”
when
adopting
a
general
formula
was
deliberate
and
indeed
at
least
the
“includes”
point
was
pointed
out
in
the
supplemental
briefs
of
the
decree.
louisiana's
other
argument
as
i
understand
it
is
that
united
states
against
california
does
not
apply
because
her
coast
has
unique
features.
of
course
the
characteristics
of
all
the
coasts
in
states
are
in
some
degree
peculiar.
the
alaska
coast
is
entirely
unlike
the
north
carolina
coast
or
the
maine
coast
is
entirely
unlike
the
louisiana
coast,
connecticut
coastline
would
be
quite
different
from
oregon's
and
so
forth.
if
one
said
that
a
state
may
get
out
from
under
the
convention
simply
by
calling
attention
to
particular
characteristics,
then
every
state's
coastline
is
drawn
off
with
litigation.
the
very
purpose
of
the
california
case
to
have
the
same
coastline
for
international
purposes
and
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act
would
be
defeated
and
the
court
and
the
congress
indirectly,
i
suggest,
would
be
put
in
the
position
of
playing
favorites
among
the
states
as
it
used
the
convention
rules
in
one
case
and
some
other
set
of
rule
and
another.
so,
we
think
as
i
say
that
the
california
decision
is
controlling.
i
should
in
that
connection
mention
once
more
point,
there
are
coastguard
lines.
there
are
some
of
the
bays
in
california
was
not
along
the
whole
coast
as
there
is
here
in
louisiana.
neither
party
in
the
california
case
thought
had
appropriate
to
invoke
those
lines.
they
might've
been
invoked
on
both
parties
thought
that
they
were
irrelevant
and
we
so
stated
to
the
court
as
i
remember
it
during
oral
argument
mentioning
the
existence
of
the
lines.
moving
along,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
no
and
of
course
mr.
justice
black,
there
never
was
any
complete
coastline
drawn
in
louisiana
until
after
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed.
alright,
the
line
has
vary
from
time
to
time
at
some
times
it
is
right
along
the
east
side
of
the
delta
here
down
on
the
east
side
of
the
delta.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
either,
to
begin
with
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
one
states
the
bureau
of
navigation,
and
ultimately
it
came
to
the
coastguard.
but
this
whole
expands
here
that
they
now
rely
on
wasn't
drawn
until
after
the
submerged
lands
act
was
adopted.
it
didn't
exist
at
the
time
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed.
indeed,
at
the
time
the
submerged
lands
act
has
passed,
louisiana's
chart
didn't
mention
that.
the
line
didn't
even
include
this
bay.
it
ran
a
little
bit
up
here
down
around
the
chandeleur
island
and
then
down
roughly
where
the
edge
of
the
green
is
now,
it
isn't
precise
but
it
was
roughly
there.
and
that
was
the
only
line
from
1935
until
1953
appeared
of
almost
20
years
according
to
our
study
of
the
record.
so,
that
the
line
louisiana
now
is
invoking
was
promulgated
after
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed.
mr.
archibald
cox
under
the
1895
statute,
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
with
changes
due
to
the
re-governmental
reorganization
but
it
was
basically
the
1895
statute.
now,
we
say
that
even
as
an
original
question
for
getting
the
california
case
thereon
that
the
coastguard
line
would
be
utterly
unacceptable
as
the
definition
of
inland
waters
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
in
order
to
put
the
two
in
proper
relation,
i
think
it's
important
that
i
go
back
and
give
a
little
bit
of
explanation
of
the
history
of
the
legislation
dealing
with
the
coastguard
line
and
the
various
lines
that
have
been
promulgated
from
time
to
time
under
that
legislation.
mr.
archibald
cox
to
a
few
very
brief
references,
yes.
i
can
elaborate
from
now
or
do
it
a
minute
later
after
i
have
--
i
have
it
firmly
in
mind
to
refer
the
court
to.
mr.
archibald
cox
in
1864,
congress
enacted
a
statute
later
incorporated
from
the
revised
statutes
that
promulgated
certain
rules
of
the
road
navigation
rules
for
all
united
states
vessels
anyone
the
kind
of
statute
that
justice
fortas
referred
to
applicable
earlier,
applicable
to
vessels
sailing
the
high
seas.
and
this
applied
to
both
naval
vessels
and
to
the
merchant
marine.
in
the
1880's,
there
were
series
of
international
conferences
on
rules
of
navigation
and
they
came
out
not
with
the
treaty
but
with
recommendations
to
the
nations
that
participated
in.
in
1890,
congress
enacted
a
new
statute
which
required
all
u.s.
vessels
upon
the
high
seas
and
in
all
waters
connected
therewith
navigable
by
seagoing
vessels
to
follow
the
new
international
rules.
that
was
to
take
effect
some
years
later
and
in
the
end
of
all
it
became
apparent
that
there
was
going
to
be
some
confusion
because
the
old
statute
adopting
the
inland
rules
still
applied
somewhere
and
the
new
statute
still
apply
to
some
vessels
somewhere.
in
1895,
having
been
advised
to
this
problem
but
congress
enacted
the
statute
that
we're
talking
about
it
appears
on
pages
150
and
151
of
the
government's
brief.
it
said
that
the
old
1864
rules,
the
inland
rules
should
be
followed
on
inland
waters
and
then
it
went
on
in
section
2
and
the
power
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
that's
the
authority
that
it
is
comes
down
to
the
commandant
of
the
coastguard,
empowered
him
from
time
to
time
to
designate
and
define
by
suitable
bearings
or
ranges
with
lighthouses,
light
vessels,
buoys
or
coast
objects
the
lines
dividing
the
high
seas
from
rivers,
harbors
and
inland
waters.
the
title
of
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
what
it
means
that
the
secretary
later
the
commandant
of
the
coastguard
is
to
provide,
is
to
define
where
the
rules,
inland
rules
are
to
apply
and
where
the
international
rules
are
to
apply.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
that
his
or
his
definition
is
binding
for
the
purposes
of
the
statute
to
be.
mr.
archibald
cox
binding
for
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
binding
for
the
purposes
of
navigational
rule.
mr.
archibald
cox
just
rules,
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
was
to
be
done
for
a
specific
purpose
as
provided
in
the
title
of
the
act
on
page
150,
an
act
to
adopt
special
rules
for
the
navigation
of
rivers,
harbors,
inland
waters
of
the
united
states
and
that
was
the
only
purpose
ever
explain.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
certainly
is
a
line
for
the
purposes
of
this
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
for
the
purposes
of
navigation,
yes.
but
it
wasn't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
two
points
and
i'm
going
to
develop
them
in
a
moment
justice
black
--
mr.
archibald
cox
--
at
considerably
more
length.
mr.
archibald
cox
no,
i'd
be
happy
to
indicate.
mr.
archibald
cox
first,
we
think
that
it
is
most
implausible
for
reasons
that
i
will
state
to
suppose
that
this
act
authorize
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
define
the
territorial
limits
of
the
united
states
for
international
purposes.
second
we
say,
even
if
the
act
should
be
construed
as
having
told
in
to
lay
out
these
lines
in
terms
of
where
our
boundary
for
international
purposes
was.
he
finally
has
never
done
it,
he
finally
has
never
purported
to
do
it,
he
finally
has
never
tried
to
do
it
and
we
say
consequently
he
hasn't
done
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
this
line
was
a
line
like
which
the
secretary
thought
and
later
the
commandant
of
the
coastguard
thought
would
be
a
good
line
to
mark
the
place
where
you
shift
it
from
the
international
rules
to
the
inland
rules.
and
he
had
said
so
over
and
over
again
that
that
was
the
only
thing
he
was
doing.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
history
is
covered
on
--
beginning
at
page
26
of
our
brief
and
running
on
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
sir.
and
running
on
to
page
41.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
was
first
made
by
the
coastguard
in
a
publication
in
1943
referred
to
on
page
33
of
our
brief,
toward
the
bottom
of
the
page.
the
coastguard
admiralty
law
enforcement
manual
and
that
begins
by
explaining
what
is
meant
by
inland
waters
and
high
seas
in
the
international
or
territorial
sense.
and
then
it
goes
on
and
says
navigation
rule.
now,
it
was
consider
another
line
of
demarcation.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
on
page
33
of
my
brief.
mr.
archibald
cox
now,
let
us
consider
another
line
of
demarcation,
something
other
than
the
line
for
international
purposes.
as
shown
in
chapter
5,
there
are
different
rules
for
navigation
on
the
inland
waters
in
the
high
seas
but
here
we
do
not
apply
the
previous
definition
but
adopt
a
new
one
for
a
convenience.
secretary
of
commerce
has
fixed
the
series
of
lines
and
so
forth.
going
over
on
page
34,
quite
obviously
this
artificial
line
does
not
truly
separate
the
high
seas
from
the
inland
waters
of
the
united
states.
it
simply
marks
the
area
within
which
the
inland
rules
apply
and
outside
of
which
the
international
rules
control.
then,
and
you
find
this
repeated
in
the
coastguard
publications
over
and
over
again.
i
call
attention
to
perhaps
the
most
significant
of
all.
in
1953,
when
the
commandant
for
the
first
time
promulgated
any
line
along
the
part
of
the
area
from
here
to
here,
well,
for
the
first
time
from
here,
he
said,
in
putting
out
that
regulation
that
it
was
drawn
solely
for
purposes
connected
with
navigation
in
shipping.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
page
34.
and
not
to
define,
not
for
the
purpose
in
defining
federal
and
state
boundaries
nor
to
define
or
describe
federal
or
state
jurisdiction
over
navigable
water.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
was
in
1953.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
was
after
the
enactment
of
the
submerged
lands
act
and
in
the
instrument
drawing
this
line
which
you
will
recall
was
drawn
after
the
enactment
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
except
that
it
was
consistent
with
the
disclaimers
that
have
been
stated
ever
since
the
very
beginning
justice
stewart.
let
me
refer
to
one
more
illustration.
mr.
archibald
cox
the
first
explicit
disclaimer
and
i'll
indicate
what
i
mean
by
explicit
in
a
few
minutes.
the
first
explicit
disclaimer
that
we
have
reference
to
came
from
the
assistant
secretary
of
state
and
it's
quoted
on
page
38
of
our
brief.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh!
this
was
back
in
the
1920's
excuse
me
i
should've
stated.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
was
the
assistant
secretary
of
state
and
the
circumstances
were
these,
the
norwegian
government
was
putting
together
materials
for
the
purpose
of
trying
before
the
international
court
of
the
famous
norwegian
fisheries
case.
so,
they
rode
around
the
world
asking
everyone
to
provide
evidence
with
respect
to
--
of
where
he
in
that
country
defined
its
territorial
boundaries.
and
the
secretary
of
state
circulated
the
departments
and
collected
everything.
they
collected
among
other
things
from
the
treasury
department
references
to
where
the
various
coastguard
lines.
and
he
explained
in
the
letter,
i
don't
quote
it
off
but
he
explained
in
part
of
it,
the
different
departments
had
adopted
different
rules
for
the
purposes
in
the
united
states
and
sent
the
coastguard
regulations
among
them
and
then
after
that
he
went
on
and
said
and
this
is
the
part
i
rely
on
particularly.
it
should
be
understood
that
the
foregoing
lines
do
not
represent
territorial
boundaries
but
are
for
navigational
purposes
to
indicate
where
the
inland
rules
begin
and
the
international
rules
seize
to
apply
but
there
again
there's
a
clear
recognition
of
the
very
limited
purpose
of
these
definitions
under
the
act
of
1895.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
that
there
is
some
question
whether
they
are
valid
within
that
area.
the
coastguard
takes
the
position
that
they
are
valid
even
though
that
is
not
inland
waters
and
in
some
part
of
course
is
not
territorial
sea.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
raises
that
question,
i
would
think
if
the
court
would
not
pass
judgment
upon
it
or
that
being
answer
in
two
steps.
first,
we
do
think
it
most
unlikely
that
the
1895
statute
was
ever
intended
to
give
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
a
power
to
fix
the
territorial
limits
of
the
united
states.
it
just
seems
inherently
impossible
that
in
a
little
act
dealing
with
navigation,
a
section
would've
been
put
in
the
only
explanation
was
that
it
was
done
at
the
request
in
shipping
interest
in
new
york
harbor
and
that
it
would
be
for
this
limited
purpose.
we
just
think
inherently
impossible
that
congress
would
have
said
the
secretary
has
now
fixed
the
territorial
limits
of
the
united
states.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
it
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
strange
first
that
it
would've
been
given
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury.
second,
that
it
was
strange
that
it
would
be
given
simply
in
an
act
entitled,
an
act
to
fix
the
rules
of
navigation.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
but
of
course
the
international
--
questions
of
international
law
that
determine
the
territorial
boundaries
of
the
united
states
are
primarily
under
the
department
of
state.
i
think
that
it
is
quite
likely
and
then
there's
one
more
point
about
the
act.
of
course
it
provides
that
the
secretary
shall
do
it,
shall
issue
these
regulations
from
time
to
time.
this
doesn't
sound
like
fixing
territorial
boundaries
for
international
purposes.
you
don't
make
them
fix
territorial
boundaries
for
international
purposes
from
time
to
time.
mr.
archibald
cox
i'm
afraid
i
don't
understand
your
honors
references.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
we
asserted
our
jurisdiction
over
the
resources.
we
didn't
purport
to
change
the
boundaries
in
terms
of
the
freedom
of
the
seas,
as
i
understand
it.
we
said
that
we
were
entitled
of
the
resources
on
the
continental
shelf
but
we
didn't
purport
to
change
our
boundaries
in
reference
to
the
high
seas.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
we
don't
--
we
were
asserting
authority
under
it
and
i
suppose
to
structures
that
came
up
my
interfere
with
navigation
although
there's
always
been
a
privilege
to
a
restructures
in
the
high
seas
for
lighthouses,
and
other
things
of
that
kind
without
there
becoming
part
of
the
territory
of
the
united
states.
that
in
any
event
today
is
covered
by
international
convention.
but
let's
--
it's
quite
possible
i
think
well
then
what
was
contemplated
immediately
was
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
would
be
guided
by
the
territorial
boundaries
and
that
he
was
instructed
for
the
convenience
of
navigation
not
to
fix
them
but
to
find
them.
but
i
suggest
two
different
things,
one
is
to
apply
the
international
rules
and
translate
them
into
buoys,
lighthouses
and
a
like,
and
the
other
thing
is
to
determine.
but
a
point
of
fact
as
i
have
suggested
whatever
the
original
intention
was
neither
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
nor
anyone
else
has
ever
done
this
in
terms
of
the
international
law.
from
the
very
beginning,
this
we'd
elaborate
in
our
brief,
the
rules
have
been
laid
down
in
ways
that
do
not
conform
either
of
this
country
or
any
other
countries
conceptions
of
international
law.
they
run
to
lighthouses,
they
take
in
large
areas
especially
of
the
main
coast
from
the
beginning
or
charleston
harbor
in
south
carolina
which
we're
not
conceivably
inland
waters
under
international
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
that
on
the
--
no
and
of
course
we've
taken
positions
in
international
conference
after
international
conference
quite
inconsistent
without
saying
that
this
is
international
law.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
indeed,
mr.
justice
so
far
as
anyone
knows
we
have
never
asserted
as
against
any
ship
flying
the
flag
of
another
nation
nor
applied
in
any
admiralty
procedure
involving
a
ship
of
another
nation.
well,
the
inland
rules
because
of
the
collision
or
sailing
in
this
area,
i
don't
--
i
can't
say
that
the
coastguard
both
hasn't
ever
hailed
to
foreign
vessel
neither
can
anyone
say
that
it
can
but
so
far
as
this
goes
it
is
a
paper
thing.
but
--
mr.
archibald
cox
so
far
as
i
know
and
of
course
and
this
is
important
on
many
aspects
of
the
case.
of
course,
as
against
our
own
nation
there
is
under
securities
in
florida,
a
clear
power
to
regulate
fishing,
shrimping,
navigation
rules
or
anything
else.
now,
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
take
it
they
undoubtedly
do
and
i
take
it
that
we
have
the
power
to
ask
them
to
do
it
and
if
they
acquiescence,
well
then
that's
that.
furthermore
--
mr.
archibald
cox
they
along
the
side
of
this
line
it
says
use
inland
rule.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
they
no
doubt
do
conform.
now,
there
are
two
--
well,
i'm
just
speaking
about
the
status
of
the
rules
today.
first,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
under
louisiana's
view
and
under
any
view
of
justice
white
that
the
validity
or
effectiveness
of
these
rules
depends
upon
these
big
inland
waters
in
the
international
sense.
they
are
plainly
invalid
today
because
the
geneva
convention
as
of
today
plainly
fixes
rules
inconsistent
with
the
inland
rules.
i
and
that
convention
which
we
have
ratified
and
undoubtedly
takes
preceding
over
anything
the
coastguard
has
done.
so
that
the
rules
cannot
be
sustained
today
on
the
theory
that
they
somehow
are
fixing
the
territorial
boundaries
of
the
united
states
in
the
international
sense,
they're
bound
to
be
invalid
under
that
theory.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
then
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but
the
question
--
they
are
fixing
what
if
they're
to
be
limited
for
only
domestic
purposes
that
is
to
say
they
apply
only
to
our
vessels.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
that
is
in
the
international
question.
that's
what
the
boundary
of
the
country
is
an
international
question.
that's
what
one
means
by
the
boundary
of
the
country
and
that
is
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that
was
the
original
historical
derivation
of
the
rule,
yes.
the
theory
was
that
the
three-mile
limit
was
a
cannon
shot
from
shore.
now,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
you
have
decided
the
case
on
that
subject.
mr.
archibald
cox
it
seems
to
me
that
the
reasons
behind
it
are
very
sound.
i
just
want
to
give
one
more
answer
to
justice
white
and
then
i
will
come
directly
to
that
point.
alright,
there
are
decisions,
justice
white,
particularly
the
english
case
of
indianapolis
which
suggest
that
a
nation
has
the
power
to
set
a
rules
in
navigation
requirements
of
navigation
for
vessels
approaching
or
leaving
their
ports
and
if
that,
i
don't
want
to
overstate
that
line,
if
that
is
sound
law
and
the
coastguard
relies
on
it,
as
i
understand
it,
then
that
would
validate
these
rules
simply
as
the
requirements
of
navigation
because
for
all
practical
purposes
the
only
vessels
coming
in
here
are
going
to
foreign
vessels
coming
in
here
are
going
to
be
foreign
vessels
going
to
the
ports
of
louisiana.
now,
i
come
to
the
question
raised
by
justice
fortas,
what
about
section
2
(c)
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
we
say
that
it
cannot
have
meant
the
inland
water
line
as
laid
down
by
the
coastguard
or
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
for
number
of
reasons.
first,
the
evidence
is
very
persuasive
that
the
term
was
used
in
the
international
sentence
in
reference
to
a
general
body
of
international
law.
this
was
the
flavor
of
the
debate.
there
are
specific
references
to
the
courts
used
of
the
term
in
the
early
california
case
where
it
clearly
indicated
that
it
referred
to
use
it
in
the
international
sentence.
and
there
is
specific
legislative
history
which
justice
harlan
asked
me
about
earlier
with
respect
to
the
coastguard
line.
there
was
testimony
from
leander
perez
of
the
delta
area
and
an
assistant
attorney
general
of
louisiana
which
referred
to
the
coastguard
line.
remembering
that
time,
this
line
did
not
exist.
indeed,
under
the
regulations
that
out
east
bay
wasn't
even
behind
the
coastguard
line.
and
this
was
referred
too
in
the
testimony
pretty
much
i
think
in
passing
at,
did
i
say
hearings
on
the
submerged
lands
act,
if
i
did
i
was
wrong.
it
was
referred
to
two
congresses
earlier
at
hearings
on
previous
bills.
then,
the
matter
was
brought
up
again
during
the
hearings
before
the
interior
committee
of
the
senate
on
the
bills
that
became
the
submerged
lands
act.
and
senator
anderson
cut-in
and
said,
well,
we've
been
all
through
that
and
we
found
that
that
line
won't
help
us.
well,
that
was
the
end
of
the
discussion.
i
added
of
course
that
a
number
of
reasons
it
might
not
help
but
what
happened
was
that
it
affected
very
little
in
the
coast.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
most
unlikely
that
congress
intended
to
give
some
official
then
the
coastguard
power
to
draw
the
lines
that
would
be
decisive
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
justice
black,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
core
of
our
position
with
respect
to
the
coastguard
line
comes
down
to
these
three
sentences.
first,
that
when
congress
spoke
of
the
coastline
or
inland
waters
in
the
submerged
lands
act
it
used
those
terms
with
reference
to
international
law
and
the
territorial
boundaries
of
the
united
states.
second,
that
whatever
may
be
said
about
the
original
purposes
of
the
act
of
1895
or
the
meaning
of
the
original
instructions
to
the
commandant
of
the
coastguard
or
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
that
he
has
not
for
years
defined
a
line
in
terms
of
international
law
or
the
territorial
boundaries
of
the
united
states.
and
consequently,
the
submerged
lands
act
was
talking
about
one
thing,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
the
commandant
were
talking
about
another
thing,
and
that
other
thing
is
irrelevant
for
the
purposes
of
this
statute.
“inland
waters”
isn't
the
word
i
might
add
that
invariably
must
have
one
meaning.
louisiana
and
the
statute
enacted
in
1948
defined
the
term
“inland
waters”
to
cover
only
waters
where
the
tide
have
been
flowed
and
excluded
all
others
from
that.
we
don't
argue
that's
the
meaning
of
inland
waters
for
the
purposes
of
submerged
lands
act.
i
simply
show
that
this
means
that
this
term
like
others
must
be
construed
with
reference
to
its
context
and
what
was
intended
to
be
done.
i
move
on
therefore
to
the
second
part
of
the
case
to
the
areas
behind
the
blue
line
which
is
louisiana's
outermost
alternate
plan
and
offshore
of
the
red
or
pink
which
we
concede
to
louisiana.
our
position
is
that
the
status
of
those
waters
is
to
be
determined
by
applying
the
geneva
convention
in
a
practical
commonsense
manner
in
accordance
with
its
terms
and
that
if
something
does
not
qualify
as
inland
waters
under
the
convention
that
it
is
not
inland
waters
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act
and
that
this
is
true
of
all
our
coast
and
therefore
specifically
true
of
the
coast
of
louisiana.
now,
in
that
connection
i
think
it's
worth
looking
at
the
geneva
convention
and
calling
attention
to
a
few
things
in
support
of
my
proposition
that
it's
intended
to
be
universal
and
exclusive.
and
since
we
omitted
to
print
the
full
text
that
may
be
fairer
to
use,
the
text
is
printed
by
louisiana
which
is
in
the
appendix,
the
third
volume
of
their
briefs
beginning
at
page
127.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
first
to
article
3
on
page
128.
limits
of
the
territorial
sea,
except
as
otherwise
provided
in
these
articles,
the
normal
baseline
for
measuring
the
breadth
of
the
territorial
sea
is
the
low
water
line
along
the
coast
is
marked
on
the
large
scale
official
chart.
so
that
unless
one
can
bring
himself
within
an
exception
elsewhere
provided
in
these
articles
is
low
water
--
is
the
coastline
is
the
line
along
the
coast,
the
low
water
line
along
the
coast
is
marked
on
the
large
scale
official
chart.
i
--
we're
not
this
explicit
that
that
is
the
line
except
is
provided
elsewhere
in
the
articles.
less
any
question
arise,
i
should
call
attention
to
the
word
“normal”
which
it
seems
to
us
quite
clear
in
this
connection
means
the
line
according
to
rule,
the
line
according
to
standard
and
not
some
word
like
“generally
or
ordinarily
or
usually.”
this
is
very
clear
from
the
history
at
one
stage
without
attempting
to
quote
exactly
the
predecessor
of
article
3
did
include
words
like
“generally”
and
the
word
“normal”
baseline
was
in
the
title.
then
for
the
specific
and
explained
purpose
of
making
it
clear
that
there
was
no
discretion
except
as
provided
in
the
convention.
those
words
“generally
or
usually”
were
strict
and
the
explanation
was
given
that
the
purpose
of
the
convention
was
to
provide
an
exclusive
uniform
set
of
rules.
alright,
--
mr.
archibald
cox
right.
i
think
it
means
according
to
standard,
according
to
rule
and
i
point
out
that
this
through
many
versions
did
not
have
normal
in
it.
the
word
“normal”
was
put
in
only
by
the
drafting
committee
and
only
when
it
was
decided
to
give
up
titles.
and
for
some
reason
it
was
put
in
that
and
i
think
it
simply
means
the
baseline
according
to
rule.
it's
in
other
words
the
drafting
committee
would've
been
authorized
to
make
such
a
major
exception.
alright,
now
there
are
other
articles
that
make
it
quite
plain
that
the
convention
was
defining
the
territorial
sea
and
contiguous
zone
in
the
coastline
both
inclusively
and
exclusively.
mr.
archibald
cox
absolutely
and
i
think
the
history
shows
that
without
any
question.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
convention
was
to
establish
a
uniform
set
of
rules
applicable
to
all
nations.
indeed,
another
incident
that
tends
to
show
this
justice
stewart
at
one
time
there
was
an
effort
in
the
proprietary
drafts
to
state
what
was
international
law
and
then
new
proposal
separately,
and
it
was
decided
that
this
should
not
be
done
because
there
wasn't
enough
agreement
on
what
was
international
law,
and
that
the
only
way
to
get
rules
eliminating
everyone's
discretion
was
to
set
them
down
in
a
treaty
that
everyone
would
adopt.
another
indication
was
pointed
out
this
morning,
this
agreement,
this
treaty
does
not
define
the
breadth
of
the
territorial
sea
it
leaves
that
to
each
nation.
and
the
draftsmen
were
very
careful
to
avoid
saying
its
three
miles
leaving
anybody
to
claim
more
if
he
wanted
to
so
as
to
leave
the
question
what
is
the
breadth
of
the
territorial
sea,
of
course,
we
have
always
taken
the
position
that
it's
no
more
than
three
miles.
article
7
as
i
say
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
we
would
--
mr.
archibald
cox
geneva
just
defines
where
it
stops.
mr.
archibald
cox
and
it
leaves
it
up
--
excuse
me.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true
and
i
think
that
we
would
not
recognize
the
texas
three
leagues
for
international
purpose.
we
have
to
recognize
them
for
rights
in
the
continental
shelf
but
not
for
international
purposes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it
was
history
boundary
of
texas
as
used
in
the
submerged
lands
act
but
of
course
it
was
found
that
louisiana's
history
boundary
did
not
go
out
three
leagues.
yes,
but
the
--
mr.
archibald
cox
if
the
united
states
chose
to
say
three
leagues
it
would
not
be
in
some
cases,
it
would
not
be
in
violation
of
the
geneva
convention.
mr.
archibald
cox
because
it
doesn't
decide
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
correct.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
that's
correct.
and
what
i
was
stating
was
not
our
interpretation
of
the
convention
but
what
i
understand
the
position
of
the
state
department
to
be.
i
was
saying
article
7
not
only
defines
a
bay
by
inclusion
but
by
exclusion.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
they're
certainly
referred
to
baselines
from
time
to
time
and
i'm
not
sure
whether
they
do
or
whether
they
don't
i
thought
i
heard
mr.
sachse
yesterday
that
they
didn't
but
as
i
read
their
brief
they
from
time
to
time
say
that
the
coastguard
line
should
be
regarded
as
straight
baseline.
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
no,
because
we
have
always
assert
and
the
state
department
has
always
asserted
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
policy
of
this
government
to
draw
of
straight
baselines.
mr.
archibald
cox
permits,
correct.
we've
never
drawn
straight
baselines
also
there
are
some
places
perhaps
where
we
could.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
because
the
geneva
convention
says
that
a
straight
baseline
shall
be
the
boundary
where
it
has
been
drawn
in
certain
ways
and
as
justice
harlan
said
in
the
california
case,
the
united
states
hasn't
drawn
any
straight
baselines.
and
therefore,
there
are
no
straight
baselines
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
archibald
cox
if
one
had
been
drawn
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but
it's
not
for
the
court
to
settle
that
question
of
foreign
policy
whether
we
should
or
shouldn't
exercise
the
permission.
if
that
something
of
if
the
nation
does
as
a
matter
of
foreign
policy.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but
unless
yes.
but
unless
the
government
elects
to
draw
straight
baselines,
the
territorial
seas
starts
at
the
other
points
defined
in
the
geneva
convention
if
the
government
does
elect
to
draw
a
straight
baseline
that
it
starts
there.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
say
that
the
united
states
which
is
a
litigant
which
is
also
concerned
with
its
foreign
policy
has
the
option
of
deciding
whether
to
draw
a
straight
baseline.
this
was
adjudication.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
that's
the
effect
of
our
position.
it
isn't,
we
state
something
that
is
much
more
important
than
that.
it's
been
a
foreign
part
of
the
foreign
policy
--
mr.
archibald
cox
that's
true
but
i
suggest
that
if
this
court
should
say
that
we
elect
to
draw
straight
baselines
that
that
would
have
a
very
important
and
unfortunate
effect
on
the
policy
that
the
state
department
has
been
consistently
followed.
if
the
court
does
it,
the
state
department
will
have
to
deliver
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i've
tried
to
say
i
would
honestly
that
i
wasn't
clear
about
louisiana's
position
on
that
and
i
can't
say
that
there
is
none.
we
say
that
there
is
none.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes,
i
think
they
do
make
the
suggestion
that
justice
white
made
it.
it
slipped
my
mind
that
maybe
the
court
should
draw
some
baselines
which
we
object
to
for
the
reason
i've
stated.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
and
i
would
further
answer
that
the
court
has
already
decided
that
in
the
california
case.
i
was
--
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
have
the
language
directly
in
front
of
me
but
there
is
a
passage
in
justice
harlan's
opinion
that
recognizes
that
only
the
united
states
and
apparently
speaking
in
terms
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
can
draw
straight
baselines
and
it
has
elected
to
draw
none
and
therefore
since
straight
baselines
were
not
applicable
on
the
decision
of
that
case.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
thought
he
was
referring
to
it
of
course
it
might
refer
to
the
legislative
branch
too.
yes,
i
was
but
not
the
judicial
branch.

u.s.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
was
arguing
that
the
exclusive
rules
must
be
found
within
the
convention
that
it
is
to
solve
the
terms
of
what
is
the
coastline
of
the
united
states
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
i
want
to
emphasize
some
of
the
implications
of
what
i
was
saying
so
that
can
be
no
mistaken
of.
first,
i
imply
that
arguments
based
on
geological
phenomena
or
economic
uniqueness
are
irrelevant
either
in
general
or
as
applied
to
specific
instances
because
the
convention
that
deals
with
one
might
call
cartographic
phenomena,
the
thing
shown
on
the
charts
of
merit
and
other
considerations
are
irrelevant
under
it.
second,
i
implied
that
the
mere
former
theories
of
the
united
states
with
respect
to
international
law,
the
rule
as
to
bays
or
rule
as
to
islands
and
so
forth
which
we
have
from
time
to
time
advanced
are
no
longer
applicable
because
the
matter
has
been
frozen
in
the
convention
and
specifically
louisiana's
arguments
that
under
some
rule
espoused
by
the
state
department
at
periods
in
our
history
before
the
geneva
convention
is
simply
irrelevant
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
just
as
our
theory
with
respect
to
monterey
bay
of
the
10-mile
bay
that
was
held
in
the
california
case
to
be
irrelevant
because
it
was
simply
something
that
we
had
propounded
prior
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
submerged
lands
act
but
was
not
embodied
in
the
convention.
next,
i
specifically
mean
to
imply
the
point
i
touched
upon
before
that
there
is
no
basis
for
claiming
straight
baselines
under
article
4
because
neither
the
congress
nor
the
executive
branch
has
ever
promulgated
straight
baselines
under
article
4.
certainly,
there
has
been
none
by
the
president
or
department
of
state,
the
commandant
would
hardly
be
the
appropriate
official
but
we
don't
--
mr.
archibald
cox
but
he
has
not
done
it
we
say
and
we
say
that
for
several
reasons.
first,
when
he
put
out
his
lines
he
expressly
said
he
was
not
claiming
anything
for
territorial
purposes.
so,
we
can't
have
been
promulgating
straight
baseline
under
article
4.
second,
the
line
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
he
drew
the
line
three
miles
in
shore,
this
yellow
line,
for
the
purposes
of
the
finding
the
rules
where
the
--
which
rules
of
road
should
apply,
yes.
he
certainly
did
that.
his
line
even
if
he
had
attempted
to
draw
it
as
a
straight
baseline
under
article
4
would
be
invalid
for
two
reasons.
and
the
first
is
no
one
can
argue
that
this
hard
can
impose
as
deeply
indented
or
cut
into
or
has
a
realm
of
islands
along
it
within
the
language
of
article
4
which
limits
the
places
where
you
can
draw
straight
baseline.
second,
article
4
limits
the
points
between
which
you
can
draw
a
straight
baseline
and
they
don't
include
buoys,
light
ships
and
rangers
bearing
an
underwater
shows
and
things
of
that
kind.
so
that
it's
clear
again
that
he
couldn't
have
done
it
even
if
he
was
trying
and
of
course
what
he
did
quite
plainly
wasn't
that
effort.
the
fourth
thing
that
i
mean
to
imply
by
saying
that
the
convention
applies
in
these
leagues
exclusive
standard
is
that
it
is
a
very
sharp
limitation
on
or
both
historic
bays
and
the
evidence
that
will
constitute
in
historic
bay.
first,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
section
6
of
article
7
applies
only
to
historic
bays.
it
doesn't
speak
of
other
historic
waters.
it's
historic
bays
and
one
therefore
must
have
something
in
the
nature
of
the
bay
before
this
exception
would
possible
imply.
but
the
kinds
of
evidence
that
will
be
sufficient
to
constitute
on
historic
bay
are
very
limited
by
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
suppose
that
the
state
must
assert,
we
are
claiming
this
as
our
territory.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
think
that
it
was
satisfied
by
saying
we
are
drawing
this
line
and
claiming
that
all
the
waters
behind
it
are
our
inland
water.
but
i
think
that
it
must
make
at
least
that
the
state
that
draws
it
is
giving
notice
to
all
the
world
that
it
is
claiming
it
as
it
waters
and
of
course
the
state
--
the
coastguard
has
always
indicated
that
we
weren't
claiming
as
our
waters.
all
that
it
is
said
is
you
should
follow
our
inland
rules
asserted
the
limited
purposes
and
not
a
claim
i
think
it's
our
territorial
sea.
now,
the
other
point
i
was
going
on
to
make
was
a
that
the
kind
of
evidence
that
is
necessary
to
show
a
bay
to
be
in
historic
bay
is
limited
to
active
assertions
of
jurisdiction
doing
something
to
somebody
by
the
coastal
state
usually
coupled
with
some
kind
of
acquiescence
by
the
others.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
mean
in
the
international
sense
and
indeed
we
argue
that
in
a
state
in
our
sentence
one
of
the
50
states
is
not
sufficient,
but
i
don't
have
to
rest
on
that
point
here
anymore
than
we
had
to
rest
on
it
from
the
california
case.
because
the
evidence
that
louisiana
invokes
here
for
the
purposes
of
claiming
historic
bays
rather
plainly
fails
to
meet
the
test
of
anybody
actively
asserting
jurisdiction.
certainly,
the
advancing
of
abstract
theories
of
international
law
that
other
nations
didn't
accept
that
we're
not
settled
international
law
without
ever
applying
them
to
particular
areas
cannot
be
regarded
as
the
necessary
kind
of
assertion
of
jurisdiction
to
constitute
in
historic
bay.
even
more
clearly,
old
maps
like
a
commerce
department
map
to
which
you
were
referred
this
morning
which
were
drawn
for
limited
purposes
do
not
constitute
an
assertion
of
jurisdiction
as
against
other
states
in
the
international
sense.
statutes
in
louisiana
purporting
to
regulate
the
taking
of
shrimp
or
oysters
or
natural
resources,
i
and
ostensibly
applicable
in
these
waters
are
not
sufficient
as
the
court
held
in
the
california
case
because
they
do
not
involved
an
actual
as
enforcement
of
jurisdiction
against
a
foreign
nation.
now,
louisiana
--
the
only
specific
things
louisiana
refers
to
anywhere.
our
series
of
criminal
prosecution
under
some
of
their
natural
resources
laws,
there
are
three
answers
to
those
points.
first,
so
far
as
we
know
all
of
those
offenses
under
louisiana
law
may
well
have
been
committed
within
the
territorial
sea,
the
three-mile
strip
within
the
bay.
some
of
them,
one
can
tell
for
the
records,
where
within
that
three-mile
strip.
second,
all
of
the
defendants
so
far
as
the
instances
they
gave
us
were
concerned
were
residence
of
louisiana
and
therefore
presumably
citizens
of
louisiana
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
(inaudible)
and
florida,
louisiana
has
the
power
to
regulate
their
conduct
on
the
high
seas
just
as
much
as
anywhere
else.
and
the
third
point
i
mentioned
earlier
and
that
is
that
what
one
of
our
50
states
does
in
our
view
is
irrelevant.
now,
against
the
background
of
those
generalizations,
i'd
like
to
take
what
time
i
can
on
some
of
the
specific
areas
that
are
in
controversy.
we're
talking
now
about
material
between
blue
lines
and
the
pink
or
red
and
i
start
at
the
west
edge
of
louisiana
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
they
did.
i
would
say
that
drawing
of
a
line
with
the
statement
we
are
not
exercising
sovereignty,
we
are
doing
it
for
a
limited
purpose
is
not
an
acceptable
assertion
of
jurisdiction
because
we're
saying
we're
not
asserting
territorial
jurisdiction
over
that.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
indicated
that
the
question
of
whether
we
could
enforce.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
of
course
we
never
did
assert
it
and
actually
apply
it
and
as
a
pronouncement
we
almost
limit.
so
that
what
it
is,
i
insists
or
suggests
isn't
anything
more
that
it
purports
to
be
of
which
was
his
statement?
we
want
and
perhaps
the
statement
we
will
require
you
to
follow
our
inland
rules.
now,
this
was
never
challenged,
there's
been
no
violation
that
was
tested
in
the
court
so
there
was
occasion
in
admiralty
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
it's
not
if
limited
to
the
mere
statement
we
will
require
you
to
follow
and
it
was
never
applied
to
anyone.
i
would
think
that
was
not
an
adequate
assertion
of
jurisdiction
because
there's
been
no
bringing
it
there.
actually,
so
far
as
i
can
see
the
only
error
where
this
come
into
play
that
is
that
east
bay
because
that's
the
only
thing
that
could
be
call
it
bay
and
that
is
why
i
don't
mean
a
strict
bay
but
a
bay
in
loose
sense
and
this
area
certainly
can
never
be
called
a
historic
bay.
there's
no
bay
about
that
and
article
7
paragraph
6
is
limited
to
bay.
alright,
i
was
about
to
start
at
the
west
end
of
the
coastline
and
take
the
segment
which
runs
from
sabine
pass
here
to
take
their
point
which
is
on
the
coast
about
here.
you'll
know
that
both
that
our
line
and
louisiana's
line
when
it
applies
the
convention
follows
the
coast
except
for
these
fingers
reaching
out,
curiously
they
even
reach
out
into
the
area
that's
already
been
adjudicated
to
be
ours.
those
are
the
inland
--
dredged
channels
to
which
mr.
miller
referred
this
morning
and
which
louisiana
claims
our
part
of
her
coast
under
the
convention.
these
channels
appeared
down
here
at
sabine
lake
in
calcasieu
pass
and
that
fresh
water
bayou,
but
there
are
other
points
along
the
coast
where
such
channels
exist
and
consequently
this
is
a
recurrent
problem
and
it
seemed
well
to
deal
with
it
at
the
outset.
now,
first
i
must
point
out
that
louisiana's
statement
on
page
336
of
the
brief
that
the
congressional
history
of
the
submerged
lands
act
clearly
shows
that
both
the
senate
and
house
of
representatives
considered
dredged
ship
channels
to
be
part
of
the
inland
waters
of
the
united
states
is
not
accurate.
the
facts
are
these,
the
history
does
show
that
at
one
stage
the
senate
committee
on
interior
and
insular
affairs
considered
and
there
was
in
the
bill
a
definition
of
inland
waters
which
include
all
estuaries,
ports,
harbors,
bays,
channels,
straights,
historic
bays,
and
sounds
whether
this
included
dredged
channels
or
not
is
anyone's
guess.
my
guess
would
be
that
it
use
channels
in
the
sense
of
the
english
channel
or
some
other
body
of
water
between
an
island
and
the
mainland
rather
than
something
just
leading
out
of
perhaps
20
miles
into
the
ocean
but
i
can't
say
that
i'm
right
but
it
certainly
doesn't
give
i'm
as
right
as
they
are.
the
next
thing
that
is
clear
is
that
this
language
was
deliberately
struck
out
of
the
bill
in
an
effort
to
leave
the
definition
of
inland
waters
entirely
to
court.
so
that
no
one
can
infer
that
there
was
any
intention
to
include
these
errors
and
we
come
to
consider
the
question
therefore
like
all
other
questions
in
terms
of
the
geneva
convention.
the
question
turns
on
article
3
and
8
of
the
convention.
article
3,
we
noted
before
except
for
where
other
was
provided
in
these
articles
the
normal
baseline
for
measuring
the
breadth
of
the
territorial
sea
is
the
low
water
line
along
the
coast.
now,
i
ask
you
keeping
that
in
mind
the
low
water
line
along
the
coast
to
jump
to
article
8
which
begins
at
the
very
bottom
of
page
106
in
the
louisiana
appendix
for
the
purpose
of
delimiting
the
territorial
sea,
the
outermost
permanent
harbour
works
which
form
an
integral
part
of
the
harbour
system
shall
be
regarded
as
forming
part
of
the
coast.
so
that
the
question
we
have
asked
ourselves
is
whether
a
dredged
channel
leading
out
from
a
port
is
a
part
of
the
permanent
harbour
works
within
the
meaning
of
article
8.
we
submit
that
such
a
channel
even
though
marked
by
aids
to
navigation
of
buoys
and
some
places,
day
beacons,
lighthouses
and
alike
is
not
part
of
the
permanent
harbour
works
that
the
term
harbour
works
refers
only
to
raise
installations
like
piers
and
jetties
and
breakwaters
which
also
a
man-made
are
physical
part
of
the
coast.
i
rest
that
conclusion
on
several
things.
the
first
place
i
don't
think
just
a
matter
of
the
ordinary
use
of
words
what
would
normally
think
of
a
dredged
channel
or
a
channel
that's
not
been
dredged
that
leads
out
from
a
part
was
covered
by
a
river
as
part
of
the
harbour
works
it
seems
to
me
an
extraordinary
use.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
say
that
those
were
like
any
lighthouse
on
a
reef
of
shore
and
both
prior
decisions
show
that
those
are
not
part
of
our
territory
and
the
discussion
was
in
the
convention
shows
that
a
lighthouse
was
not
treated
to
be
treated
as
part
of
the
territory
of
the
literal
state
unless
it
was
fixed
to
the
shore.
mr.
archibald
cox
they
never
gets
up
above
the
water
or
if
it
does
it
isn't
connected
to
the
coast.
it's
all
underwater.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
when
i
say
coast,
i
mean
land
or
physical
structures
above
water.
i
suppose
that
if
you
were
underneath
you
could
find
some
connection.
but
it's
by
coast
we
mean
the
land
above
water
and
this
is
not
above
water.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
if
these
were
banks
which,
and
that
by
banks
i
mean
that
something
that
was
consistently
continuously
above
the
water
reaching
out
from
the
coast
then
we
would
have
a
harder
time.
but
they
aren't
(voice
overlap)
i
think
--
mr.
archibald
cox
how
do
i
think
you
would,
sir?
mr.
archibald
cox
i
don't
think
anyone
contends
that
there's
banks
that
run
continuously
above
the
sea
level.
mr.
archibald
cox
but
certainly
i
don't
understand
mr.
miller
to
be
saying
that,
i
am
prepared
to
assert
that
they
do
not.
i'm
not
prepared
to
assert
that
some
little
pile
of
earth
doesn't
occasionally
get
up.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
think
you
should
say
that
an
area
of
water
is
not
to
be
assimilated
under
article
7
to
something
that
is
spoken
of
as
permanent
harbour
works
performing
part
of
the
coast
because
the
coast
means
in
the
convention
and
in
usage
in
this
area
something
above
water
if
the
notion
was
to
make
these
water
areas
part
of
the
inland
waters.
the
place
to
have
dealt
with
that
was
in
the
sections
on
bays
or
inland
waters,
the
most
likely
place
to
have
dealt
with
it
would
be
in
the
area
of
roadsteads
because
there
the
convention,
this
is
in
the
article
9.
there,
the
convention
was
dealing
with
areas
of
water
of
the
coast
in
the
sense
there's
something
above
the
land.
and
the
convention
said
that
while
we
will
make
this
part
of
the
territorial
sea,
they
didn't
even
make
some
inland
waters.
we
make
them
part
of
the
territorial
sea
even
though
they
lie
more
than
three
miles
of
shore
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
had
been
any
intention
to
treat
these
areas
of
water
with
their
lighthouses,
towers,
the
distant
points
along
them
as
belonging
somehow
to
the
literal
state
that
that
was
the
place
to
have
done
it.
now,
there
was
a
proposal
to
make
buoyed
channels,
didn't
say
anything
about
whether
they
were
dredged
or
not.
to
make
buoyed
channels,
i
gave
them
the
same
status
as
roadsteads
and
the
international
law
commission
rejected
that
which
we
think
while
not
conclusive
points
in
the
direction
of
a
showing
and
confirming
the
inference
that
i
would
otherwise
draw
that
these
water
areas
were
not
assimilated
to
something
that
it
is
above
water.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
but
one
finds
article
8
saying
that
that
shall
be
regarded
as
forming
part
of
the
coast.
now
i
suggest
that
treating
it
as
part
of
the
coast
strongly
suggest
that
the
draftsman
had
in
mind
things
above
the
water.
otherwise,
it
would've
been
extra
ordinary
to
say
that
something
that
is
nothing
but
a
water
area
shall
be
treated
as
if
it
were
something
out
of
what.
that
doesn't
seem
to
being
an
exceedingly
odd
way
to
come
out
and
the
history
i
refer
to
i
suggest
confirms
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
there
are
--
there
are
lights
that
go
out
without
halfway.
mr.
archibald
cox
some
are
buoys,
some
are
tripods.
the
water
isn't
very
deep.
they're
not
connected
to
one
another.
they're
just
like
to
many
lights
and
fixed
buoys
or
fixed
lights
along
the
new
england
coast.
mr.
archibald
cox
unless
they
were
somehow
connected
above
the
water.
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
like
as
frequent
as
the
hundred
yards
and
they
are
essentially
we
say
like
many
aids
to
navigations
that
nations
have
put
in
the
high
seas
maintain
lighthouses,
they
have
certain
privilege
--
mr.
archibald
cox
oh
yes.
well,
it
would
be
very
hard
for
other
--
for
vessels
of
any
size
to
get
into
that
harbor
i
presumably
there
might
still
be
a
harbor.
there
certainly
would
be
inland
waters
up
in
this
area.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
i
think
i
would
say
they
were
built
to
give
vessels
of
greater
draft
that
could
previously
get
in
access
to
the
harbor
like
other
dredging.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
would
say
harbour
system
means
fixed
structures
above
the
water.
i
don't
--
for
one
thing
remember
we're
talking
about
something
there
can
be
a
low
water
line
on
and
you
can't
have
a
low
water
line
out
an
area
sticking
way
out
here.
it's
a
physical
impossibility.
mr.
archibald
cox
i
thought
a
great
deal
about
that
justice
harlan
and
i'd
like
to
divide
my
answer
into
several
parts
always
directing
myself
i
think
to
your
question.
first,
it's
entirely
clear
to
me
that
the
initial
issue
or
the
effect
of
the
coastguard
line
should
be
resolve
by
the
court
now.
second,
there
a
very
considerable
number
of
other
issues
which
can't
be
elucidated
by
any
further
factual
evidence
and
i
think
those
should
be
decided
by
the
court
now.
also,
i
recognized
that
it
might
be
of
some
aid
to
the
court
or
to
have
an
experience
master
and
expert
master
go
through
them
and
we
know
them
out.
but
despite
that,
i
am
very
sure
they
would
all
be
back
here
with
as
long
brief
and
much
the
same
argument
if
we
all
live
long
enough
that
the
court
would
be
here
and
they
would
be
back
far
it.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
mr.
archibald
cox
well
i
--
the
reason
i
was
going
to
say
as
against
the
advantages
of
sending
it
to
a
master
from
the
court's
point
of
view
in
terms
of
the
total
administration
of
justice
if
this
case
went
to
a
master
with
nothing
decided
with
the
coastguard
line,
no
one
would
know
what
evidence
to
put
in
and
what
evidence
not
to
put
in,
and
the
result
of
course
would
be
everybody
would
dump
in
all
the
evidence
that
he
could
find
and
i
think
the
total
effect
would
be
a
worst
morass
and
that
the
court
would
have
it
all
back
in.
now,
the
last
part
of
my
answer,
mr.
justice
harlan,
is
that
there
are
some
points
that
the
argument
where
there
appeared
to
be
some
questions
of
fact.
i
don't
think
those
are
real
questions
put
on
the
face
of
the
briefs
they
seem
to
be
here.
i
do
think
that
if
the
court
were
to
do
the
work
of
resolving
the
questions
of
law
now
that
it
would
turn
out
that
there
were
no
significant
factual
differences
among
it.
so,
on
the
whole,
by
urging,
my
recommendation
is
that
the
court
must
face
a
large
number
i
think
all
of
these
questions
but
i
don't
want
to
pretend
that
isn't
the
difficult
matter
of
balance.
what
i
do
want
to
urge
very
strongly
is
that
authorities
be
given
--
will
be
given
all
the
guidance
and
that
the
master
be
given
if
the
court
decides
to
send
it
to
master.
all
the
guidance
it
can
that
is
i
think
the
question
i've
been
talking
about
is
one
that
can
be
resolve
here.
i
don't
think
this
and
many
of
the
other
questions
can
be
resolve
here
if
there
remain
some
others
then
at
least
we
can
get
part
of
the
money
distributed
but
we
could
focus
on
specific
issues
in
the
subsequent
proceeding.
and
i
think
it
would
be
more
efficient
way
to
administer
justice.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
he
was
two
minutes
and
perhaps
he'll
enlighten
you,
your
honor.
mr.
archibald
cox
no.
mr.
archibald
cox
they're
all
within
three
miles
of
the
coastline.
mr.
archibald
cox
as
we
interpret
the
coastline.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
let's
look
at
this
maybe
we
can
see
it
better
on
the
smaller
one.
the
reason
is
that
remember
when
you
draw
the
coastline,
you
swing
a
three-mile
arc
dot
it
from
any
low
tide
elevation.
mr.
archibald
cox
yes
but
it's
not
so
much
the
islands
here
as
it
is
low
tide
elevations
within
three
miles
of
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
archibald
cox
yes.
i
don't
know
whether
i'm
trespassing
too
much.
we
do
stick
with
it
as
we
don't
claim
this.
mr.
archibald
cox
well,
at
one
time.
mr.
archibald
cox
alright,
at
one
time
the
state
department
was
asserted
that
a
realm
of
islands
within
perhaps
six
miles
or
later
perhaps
10
miles
of
each
other
an
area
like
this
did
enclose
inland
waters.
this
was
the
position
that
the
united
states
in
1953.
until
the
decision
in
the
california
case
the
view
of
the
government
was
that
we
should
apply
the
position
of
the
state
department
in
1953.
so,
we
find
it
here.
now,
we'd
learned
two
things
later.
first,
that
that
wasn't
the
international
law
but
it
was
our
claim
that
it
wasn't
the
international
law;
and
second,
that
we
weren't
governed
by
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
1953
but
by
the
geneva
convention
as
the
court
held
in
the
california
case.
other
result
was
that
there
was
nothing
more
than
that
we
would've
apply
the
geneva
conventions
but
a
lot
of
things
can
happen.
we
had
said
the
opposite
to
this
court
and
the
court
relied
on
it.
we
had
--
there
had
been
leasing
and
people
had
relied
on
it
and
we
repeatedly
doubt
with
louisiana
in
this
term
and
it
seem
to
me
that
it
was
not
suitable
becoming
for
the
united
states
having
gone
that
far
to
suddenly
say
well
we
made
a
mistake,
we're
sorry
we
led
you
all
into
this
but
we
insist
now
and
backing
out.
so,
we
think
it's
a
purely
practical
matter
while
we
did
it,
we're
stuck
with
it
and
we
ought
to
live
by
it.
and
it's
on
that
basis
and
no
rule
of
international
law
--
