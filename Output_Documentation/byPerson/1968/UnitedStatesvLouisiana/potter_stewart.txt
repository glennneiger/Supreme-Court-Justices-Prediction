but
where
is
the
mainland
on
that
chart?
justice
potter
stewart
those
are
all
islands,
how
about
up
--
above
to
your
left?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
but
it's
still
mainland?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
think
of
that
as
the
coastline
of
the
united
states
rather
than
the
coastline
of
louisiana,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
as
being
within
three
miles
from
inland
waters?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
right.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it
mr.
cox
the
--
looking
at
your
chart
the
line
which
you
say
is
the
seaward
limit
of
the
seaward
limit
of
louisiana's
primary
claim
that
line
is
--
is
that
line
a
line
parallel
to
the
coastguard
line
three
miles
distance?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
line
is
a
line
parallel
to
the
coastguard
line
three
miles
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
southerly?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
what
page
are
you
on?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
in
year
1953?
justice
potter
stewart
before
or
after
the
enactment
of
the
submerged
lands
act?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
this
partially
explain
the
disclaimer,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what's
the
authority
of
the
united
states
to
proscribe
those
inland
rules
on
the
--
in
the
territorial
within
that
coastguard
lines
what's
this
if
it's
--
there
really
isn't
of
territorial
waters,
what
is
the
authority?
justice
potter
stewart
but
your
position
would
raise
that
question.
justice
potter
stewart
but
of
course
that
maybe
before
that,
that
ships
of
other
nations
observed
these
rules
in
that
area.
justice
potter
stewart
all
the
charts
--
all
the
charts
in
the
chart
row
of
any
ship
would
show
that
the
inland
rules
apply
within
that
line.
justice
potter
stewart
exactly.
justice
potter
stewart
in
every
chart
room
of
every
ship
no
matter
what
(voice
overlap)
by
sailing
under
would
have
charge
indicating
unanimous
ships
would
comply.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
that
word
“normal”
doesn't
mean
more
or
less
the
same
thing
that
generally
speaking
would
mean.
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
lay
that,
your
submission
is
that
the
word
--
that
in
article
3
would
have
the
same
meaning
as
it
does
have
if
the
word
“normal”
were
not
there
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
could
i
just
ask
you
with
this,
does
louisiana
rely
to
any
extent
in
any
of
the
arguments
on
article
4
that's
the
baseline
method
of
setting
(voice
overlap)?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
has
--
in
the
negotiations
between
united
states
and
louisiana,
have
any
of
the
agreed
upon
locations
of
the
coastline
rested
upon
agreements
under
article
4?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
even
where
the
geneva
convention
permits?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
it
didn't
permits
it.
if
it
permits
it
why
you
can't
rely
on
the
geneva
convention
as
precluding
at
the
purposes
of
this
lawsuit?
