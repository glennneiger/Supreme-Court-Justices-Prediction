justice
abe
fortas
for
what
purpose
was
that
line
established?
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps
that's
the
issue,
that
is
to
say,
as
i
understand
you
and
as
i
understand
the
fact,
that
line
was
drawn
for
purposes
of
determining
which
navigational
rules
would
apply.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
miller
as
i
understand
that
your
--
i
thought
you
are
going
to
argue
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
convention
did
apply?
justice
abe
fortas
but
now
what
you're
saying
is
that
even
if
the
convention
does
apply
it
should
not
apply
in
respect
of
these
particular
points
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that
you
are
raising
such
as
east
bay?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
you
apply
it
--
well,
now
let
me
just
be
very
sure
that
i'm
following
you
the
best
i
can.
you're
saying
that
even
if
you
apply
the
convention,
this
is
your
alternative
argument
and
i
understand
that.
if
you
apply
the
convention
then
you
don't
apply
all
of
the
definitions
in
the
convention
and
you
take
louisiana's
historical
inland
waters
in
the
case
that
you
were
just
discussing
which
relates
to
east
bay.
if
you
take
this
convention
literally
with
respect
to
the
definition
of
a
bay
and
article
7,
wouldn't
that
rule
out
the
east
bay?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
tell
me
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
why
it
would
not?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
just
taking
this
is
an
illustration.
justice
abe
fortas
because
i'm
trying
to
get
the
principle
upon
which
you're
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
arguing
that
case
and
i
haven't
got
it
yet.
justice
abe
fortas
must
hold?
you
must
hold
the
convention
to
be
unconstitutional?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
maybe
that
--
maybe
i
didn't
understand
you.
as
what
you're
saying
is
that
you
accept
the
convention
in
this
branch
from
the
argument
except
where
it
conflicts
with
what
you
argued
to
be
louisiana's
historical
territory.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
then
where
does
your
argument
about
unconstitutionality
play
a
role?
justice
abe
fortas
you
say
if
you
ignore
what
you
say
is
the
exception
in
article
7
exception
of
historic
bays,
if
that
is
ignored
then
the
result
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me
mr.
miller,
where
is
article
7
in
your
brief?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
government.
i'm
looking
at
the
government's
brief
here
(voice
overlap).
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
they
have
what
purports
to
be
article
7
that
starts
on
page
145.
justice
abe
fortas
and
they
don't
have
that
present.
justice
abe
fortas
thank
you.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
a
definition
in
the
treaty
of
historic
waters
or
historic
bays?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
noticed
that
article
7
that
the
reference
says
the
so-called
historic
bays
and
historic
is
in
quotes
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
why
is,
your
point
i
take
it
is
that
the
action
of
regulating
the
navigation
on
the
inland
waters
was
an
act
of
sovereign?
justice
abe
fortas
and
since
that
arguably
sovereign
power
was
exercised
with
respect
to
east
bay
taking
that
as
an
illustration
that
constituted
an
exercise
of
sovereignty
over
east
bay
by
the
national
government
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
therefore,
it
followed
that
east
bay
is
historic
waters?
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
that's
quite
enough
for
me
at
the
moment
and
for
what
i
want
to
ask
is
you
would
not
argue
of
course
that
the
comparable
exercise
of
control
over
navigation
on
the
open
seas
constituted
an
act
of
sovereignty
over
the
open
seas,
would
you?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
you
wouldn't
say
that
taking
this
in
clearly
international
waters
that
the
regulation
of
shipping,
united
states
shipping
in
the
international
waters,
that's
not
an
act
of
sovereignty.
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
there
any
--
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me,
mr.
miller.
now
but
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
difference
fundamental
--
the
fundamental
proposition
in
law
between
you
and
the
government
and
let
us
say
both
agree
that
east
bay
has
to
be
considered
historic
waters
for
this
purpose
if
there
has
been
an
exercise
of
historically
and
exercise
of
sovereignty.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
doesn't
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
government
construe?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
maybe
that
will
tell
us
but
that's
not
the
way
i
read
their
brief.
but
then
they
go
on
to
say
that;
(a)
that
has
to
be
an
exercise
of
sovereignty
by
the
national
government
and
(b)
that
there
has
been
no
such
exercise
of
sovereignty
by
the
national
government.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
there
is
a
perplexing
--
may
raise
a
perplexing
question
for
us
because
it
may
not
be
just
a
question
of
law
but
it
may
be
a
question
of
fact,
too.
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
problem
is
one
that
my
brother
harlan
raised
earlier
which
is
whether
we
can
decide
this
or
whether
we
have
--
there
has
to
be
a
master.
justice
abe
fortas
but
you've
cited
a
lot
about
other
things
here
not
only
navigation
laws
which
prove
your
case
may
not
--
justice
abe
fortas
have
we
asserted
as
the
united
states
asserted
jurisdiction
or
authority
over
those
waters,
the
white
water
shown
there
in
any
time
other
than
for
purposes
of
the
application
of
inland
navigational
rules?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
if
let's
say
a
ship
of
a
foreign
nation
came
within
three
miles
of
the
edge
of
the
light
with
the
white
joins
the
green
later
we
would
not
claim
that
it
was
within
united
states
territorial
waters.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
let
me
make
sure
that
i
understand
that.
what
you're
saying
is
that
in
that
white
area
we
have
never
attempted
to
enforce
domestic
regulations
against
foreign
vessels?
justice
abe
fortas
now
really
what
were
after
is
try
to
find
out
the
intent
of
congress,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
and
all
of
these
talk
about
the
international
rule
as
this
as
a
means
towards
that
end.
justice
abe
fortas
the
plus
effect
that
we
have
decided
the
case
in
that
subject.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
what
about
some
steel
towers,
the
way
were
shown?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
miller
says
that
the
material
that
is
dredged
up
is
pile
on
the
sides
of
the
channel.
justice
abe
fortas
it
is
not
connected
to
the
coast?
justice
abe
fortas
point
of
view
was
making
as
i
understood
suggested
that
this
is
just
like
a
jetty
instead
of
being
made
of
steel
or
a
pier
instead
of
being
made
of
steel
or
wood
or
whatnot
it's
made
of
earth
and
it
has
on
that
these
high
towers.
justice
abe
fortas
excuse
me,
how
do
you
think
we
ought
to
decide
that
mr.
cox?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
think
we
ought
to
know
about
it
i
mean
say,
i
haven't
seen
these
and
the
court
has
hasn't
seen
them
and
we
don't
have
an
evidentiary
record
before
us,
do
we?
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps,
i
misunderstood
mr.
miller
on
that.
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
we
are
to
decide
it
for
instance
on
the
basis
of
a
general
proposition
of
law
that
unless
these
mounts
show
up
above
the
water
they
don't
fit
within
the
definition
that
they
do.
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
the
question
was
whether
this
was
an
outermost
permanent
harbor
work
forming
an
integral
part
of
the
harbour
system?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
cox
if
i
felt
comfortable
that
there
were
no
issue
of
fact
that's
been
post
between
you
and
mr.
miller
with
respect
to
the
dredged
channels
and
few
more
comfortable
about
your
last
observations
and
perhaps
after
we
read
the
record
(voice
overlap)
the
transcript
of
argument,
consider
the
briefs
more
thoroughly
than
(voice

conclusion
but
i
did
not
get
that
impression
in
the
course
of
argument.
justice
abe
fortas
for
what
purpose
was
that
line
established?
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps
that's
the

that
is

as

and
mr.

consider
the

in
the
course
