mr.
victor
a.
sachse
yes.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
i'm
victor
sachse,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1960,
as
your
honors
know,
in
the--
in
an
earlier
stage
of
this
same
case,
your
honors
held
that
the
submerged
lands
act
of
1953
confirmed
or
put
claim
to
louisiana,
mississippi,
and
alabama
three
miles
from
their
cost
lines
while
put--
claiming
three
leagues
for
texas
and
florida.
in
your
decree,
as
in
the
submerged
lands
act
itself,
the
“coast
line”
is
defined
as
meaning
the
ordinary
low
water
along
that
portion
of
the
coast
which
is
in
direct
contact
with
the
open
sea
and
the
line
marking
the
seaward
limit
of
inland
waters.
this
court
retained
jurisdiction.
some
few
modifications
were
made
in
december
1965
by
the
united
states
but
the
coast
line,
although
it
long
ago
is
designated
and
defined
by
agencies
of
the
federal
government
directed
by
congress
to
do
that
very
thing
and
although
it
was
long
ago
accepted
and
approved
by
the
state
of
louisiana,
has
not
been
approved
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
so,
last
september,
we
filed
a
motion
to
have
the
court
recognize
it.
in
january,
the
attorney
general
responded,
opposed
recognition
of
this
line.
instead,
asked
for
the
recognition
of
the
line
according
to
his
interpretation
of
the
geneva
convention,
the
convention
on
the
territory
of
seas
and
contiguous
zones.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
we
don't
refer
to
it
as
the
coastguard
lines
because
it
was
marked
so
long
before
the
coastguard
had
anything
to
do
with
it.
we
refer
to
it
as
the
inland
waterline,
but
i'm
sure
we're
talking
to
the
same
thing,
justice
harlan.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
well,
we
use
it
and
we
refer
to
it
as
the
inland
waterline
because
the
congress
directed,
in1895,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
mark,
to
designate,
and
define
by
suitable
bearings
or
ranges
with
lighthouses,
light
vessels,
buoys,
or
coast
objects,
their
lines
dividing
the
high
seas
from
rivers,
harbors,
and
inland
waters.
and,
“inland
waters”
is
the
basis
of
this
issue
as
we
have
it.
it
is
the
basis
of
the
statute.
it
is
the
point
of
argument
between
ourselves
and
the
solicitor
general.
i
want
to
say
that
the
phase
of
the
argument
which
i
will
attempt
to
cover
relates
to
the
inland
waterline.
in
january
of
this
year,
the
solic--
the
attorney
general,
through
the
solicitor,
claimed
a
different
line
based
on
the
geneva
convention.
louisiana
started
to
leave
the
issue
right
there,
but
we
concluded
that
we
found
the--
that
line
wrong
also
and
that
incorrect
interpretations
of
the
geneva
convention
had
been
used,
as
we
understand
it.
so,
we
filed
in
may
an--
a
motion
for
an
ultimate
line.
mr.
jp
miller
of
new
orleans
will
speak
to
the
court
with
respect
to
the
lines
relating
to
the
geneva
convention
and
i
will
not.
there
is
no
dispute,
your
honors,
as
to
this
inland
waterline
as
designated
and
defined
by
agencies
of
the
federal
government
pursuant
to
the
1895
act.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
correct,
sir.
there
is
not
dis--
no
factual
dispute
about
its
existence
and,
therefore,
argu--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
that
is
right
and,
therefore,
the
argument
concerning
it
need
not
take
as
much
time
as
the
argument
about
any
line
under
the
geneva
convention
which
would
necessarily
involve
a
great
many
disputes
about
fact.
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
a
statement
from
a
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
government
in
the
1956
stage
of
this
case,
in
which
it
was
said
to
the
court
that
louisiana
shore,
and
i
draw
a
distinction
between
shore
and
coast
as
we
go
along
in,
the
united
states
said
that
louisiana
shore
has
a
contour
so
nearly
leveled
that
even
minor
wind
variations,
and
your
honors
know
that
we
have
hurricanes
of
unbelievably
severe
power,
can
cause
various
substantial
differences
in
a
point
to
which
the
tide
retreats,
says
the
government.
the
shoreline
is
not
a
stable
one
and
that's
quite
true
and
quite
an
understatement
but,
they
added,
is
subject
through
most
of
its
length
to
rapid
and
substantial
changes
of
islands
may
be
moved
as
many
as
four
miles.
a
judicial
inquiry
for
the
precise
location
of
the
entire
shoreline
might
be
stretched
to
require
many
years
for
completion,
so
said
the
government
in
1956.
although
such
a
consideration
ought
not
to
be
necessary,
and
it
is
not
really,
in
our
opinion,
although
the
inland
waterline
was
designated
and
defined
long
ago,
has
been
marked
on
public
charters
published
to
the
world
and
not
challenged
and,
in
our
opinion,
ought
to
be
understood
by
everyone
to
be
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
as
used
by
this
court,
as
used
by
the
congress,
a
great
part
of
the
time,
allotted
to
louisiana
and
has
been
assigned
to
my
friend,
mr.
miller,
because
of
a
difficulty
in
discussing
factual
distinctions
with
respect
to
any
sort
of
the
geneva
line.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
the
1895
line
was
established
originally,
justice
harlan,
as
we've
tried
to
outline
in
our
brief,
because
the
congress
made
a
deliberate
decision
in
1885
that
it
would
prescribe
different
rules
for
the
inland
waters
of
the
united
states
than
for
the
territorial
sea.
and,
it
became
necessary
then
to
find
out
where
this
is,
where
this
was
then.
in--
your
honors
know,
of
course,
of
the
delaware
involving
the
channels,
getting
its
channel
to
the
harbor
of
new
york.
after
the
1885
act
was
passed,
before
the
1895
act
was
passed,
a
collision
occurred.
and,
this
court
in
the
case
of
the
delaware
had
to
consider
whether
international
rules
or
inland
rules
were
to
be
applied
to
the
case.
your
honors'
predecessors
said
then
that
the
1895
act
had
not
drawn--
1885
act
had
not
drawn
any
line,
and
to
quote
from
the
court,
“nor
could
any
general
legislation
do
so.”
but,
the
court
added,
the
congress
by
the
act
of
1895,
passed
since
the
occurrence
which
caused
the
case
to
be
before
the
court
had
arisen,
had
directed
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
designated
and
defined
the
line
and
he
had
done
so,
and
this
court
decided
that
the
inland
rules
marked--
declared
by
congress
applied
in
the
inland
waters
designated
and
defined
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
as
fully
as
if
new
york
harbor
itself
were
involved.
now--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
that
is
not
to
be
disputed,
but
from
that
or
with
that
flows,
in
our
opinion,
the
rights
of
territory,
the
rights
of
sovereignty
because
without
the
right
of
sovereignty
the
united
states
would
not
have
the
right
to
legally
declare
that
inland
rules
of
navigation
apply
to
foreign
vessels
within
this
line.
i
cite
you
to
collins,
in
his
work
on
the
subject
in
1949.
now,
louisiana
knows
that
whether
you
consider
this
as
the
coastline
of
the
united
states
for
all
references,
it
was
within
the
meaning
of
congress
the
coastline
where
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed,
and
i
used
the
verb
i
have
chosen
because
it
was
presented
to
congress
by
a
spokesman
from
louisiana
much
as
we're
presenting
it
to
you
on
this
year
today
in
1949
when
earlier
legislation
was
before
the
congress
and
before
the
senate.
in
respect
to
modifying
the
rules
of
the
first
california
case,
the
bill
is
then
pending,
referred
to
“shore.”
and,
louisiana
spokesman
stood
before
that
committee
and
said
that
“shore”
was
the
wrong
word
to
use.
“coast”
was
the
right
word
to
use
and
the
reason
“coast”
should
be
used
was
because
not
only
was
that
a
part
of
our
act
of
admission,
not
only
was
it
a
part
of
our
constitution
but,
more
closely
to
the
point,
congress
itself
had
used
the
word
“coast”
in
the
1895
act
in
undertaking
to
say
where
the
inland
waters
are.
and,
our
spokesman
then,
as
i
now,
call
that
act
to
the
attention
of
congress,
called
the
delaware
to
the
attention
of
congress
and,
from
that
time
on,
the
legislation
pending
used
the
word
“coast,”
“coastline,”
and
not
“shores.”
there
was
an
attempt,
while
the
submerged
lands
act
was
before
congress,
by
certain
senators
who
opposed
the
act
entirely.
there
was
an
attempt
by
the
then-attorney
general
of
the
united
states
to
have
the
congress
accept
the
idea
of
a
shoreline
instead
of
a
coastline,
but
this
was
rejected
and
the
idea
of
the
coastline
was
used.
now,
i
pass
to
another
phase.
immediately
following
the
act
of
1895,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
began
to
mark
this
line
to
designate
and
define
the
line
between
inland
waters
and
the
high
seas.
as
directed
by
congress,
he
used
“coast
objects,”
which
means
to
us
“coastline.”
as
directed
by
congress,
he
used
“light
vessels
and
buoys,”
which
means
to
us
that
congress
knew
then,
as
it
had
known
in
all
of
its
earlier
acts,
that
at
least
the
part
of
the
united
states
had
its
coastline
in
the
water,
and
so
it
has
been
ever
since.
the
government
says
in
its
current
briefs
that
not
until
1937
were
there
any
indication
by
the
government
that
this
line
meant
something
different,
that
it
didn't
actually
divide
inland
waters
from
the
high
seas,
that,
after
that
time,
they
began
to
put
a
different
legend
on
their
charts
or
in
their
publications.
mr.
shalowitz
for
the
department
of
commerce
says
the
change
occurred
in
1948.
whichever
date
you
take,
the
fact
is
that,
by
that
time,
we
were
in
litigation
and,
by
that
time,
the
government
had
changed
its
position
of
not
claiming
any
waters
or
any
lands
beneath
submerged
waters
out
from
the
shores
of
the
states
and,
by
that
time,
you
were
heading
towards
your
first
california
decision.
and,
i
submit--
we
submit
that
change
is
made
by
the
government
in
its
treatment
of
its
own
publications
after
the
case
was
in
litigation
ought
not
to
bear
much
weight
with
the
court.
we
point
to
the
fact
that,
in
the
government's
brief
in19--
they
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
coastguard
commandant
who,
by
that
time,
was
the
officer
who
then
had
the
duty
formerly
possessed
by
the
secretary
of
treasury,
by
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
labor,
by
the
secretary
of
commerce.
now,
the
commandant
of
the
coastguard
has
it.
and,
when
he
finished
marking
on
the
charts,
not
designating
and
defining
the
lights
and
the
vessels
and
the
coast
markings
but
actually
physically
putting
a
line
on
the
chart,
he
did
make
a
statement,
in
which,
he
said
he
was
doing
this
for
navigation
and
he
was
not
undertaking
to
set
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states
or
of
the
states
or
of
the
jurisdiction
of
either.
we
don't
find
fault
with
that
statement
because,
at
that
time,
it
had
not
been
determined
whether
there
would
be
three
leagues
for
the
states
or
three
miles
for
the
state
or
some
for
one
and
some
for
another.
and,
the
commandant
may
have
been
trying
to
save
that
point
but,
whatever
his
intention
was,
he
had
to
conclude
as
the
congress
directed
him
to
conclude
by
saying
that
the
inland
rules
enacted
by
congress
related
to
the
waters
landwards
of
this
line
and
the
international
rules
of
the
high
seas
related
to
waters
seaward
of
the
line.
i
take
one
moment
to
point
something
that
mr.
miller
will
explain
to
you
more
carefully.
this
heavy
green
line
is
the
line
marked
by
the
agencies
of
the
federal
government
which
louisiana
accepted
in
1954.
this
rather
lighter
line,
dotted
line,
is
the
hundred-thousandth
line
of
the
continental
shelf
and,
for
a
long
time,
was
thought
to
be
the
edge
of
the
outer
continental
shelf.
all
of
the
area
in
between
is
area
that
is
exclusive
to
the
federal
government.
only
this
area
is
in
issue.
the
red
line
is
the
line
which
the
government
contends
is
the
coastline
and
which
so
nearly
follows
the
louisiana
shore.
i
come
now
in
some
haste
because
of
the
limited
time
allotted
here.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
you
mean
the
commandant
could
change
this
line?
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
this
is
not
our
position,
justice
brennan,
because--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
we
think
that
if
we
are
correct
that
this
is
now
declared
by
congress
through
its
action
to
be
the
coastline
of
louisiana,
then
no
one
has
the
right
to
change
it
for
any
purpose
but,
certainly,
no
one
has
the
right
to
change
it
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
i'll
not
stand
before
the
court
and
say
that
they
are
not
mobile
boundaries
on
the
sea
that
as
land
moves,
as
land
builds
out
by
the
mississippi,
as
land
recedes
in
other
portions
of
our
shore
that
adjustments
will
not
have
to
be
made
some
time.
but,
so
far
as
the
submerged
lands
act
is
concerned,
the
congress
had
said,
first,
by
one
act
divided
into
two:
submerged
lands
act
and
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
in
pursuance
of
the
truman
doctrine
of
1945,
nobody
but
the
united
states
is
going
to
have
any
of
the
minerals
on
mineral
resources
from
this
submerged
lands
on
our
continental
shelf.
now,
we
will
divide
that
between
the
federal
government
and
the
state
governments.
and,
they
did
it
in
the
fashion,
your
honors
know,
of
saying
either
three
miles
or
three
leagues
as
can
be
shown.
i
must
take
a
minute
or
two
on
the
california
case.
i
cannot
ignore
the
fact
that,
in
this
second
california
case,
when
the
lawyer
stood
before
this
court,
and
you
did
not
have
the
benefit,
justice
harlan,
of
any
such
light
as
this,
and
justice
brennan
and
justice
goldberg
asked
mr.
cox
whether
california
or
the
united
states
had
any
argument
to
be
based
upon
the
inland
waterline.
mr.
cox
said
no
and
california
didn't
dispute
it.
so
far
as
we
can
find
from
the
briefs,
so
far
as
we
can
find
from
the
report
of
the
decision
by
this
court,
there
was
no
mention
of
the
delaware
case.
there
was
no
mention
at
all
of
that,
yet
that
is
the
case
that
we
think
is
most
important
of
all.
your
honors
said,
through
you,
justice
harlan,
that
when
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed
there
was
no
definition
of
inland
waters
because
the
managers
expected
that
earlier
decisions
and
earlier
acts
of
congress
would
supply
that
definition,
and
it
was
only
because
of
the
lack
of
the
section
of
a
definition
that
you
turn
to
the
geneva
convention.
and,
i
will
close
with
this.
if
it
be
said
in
argument
as
it
had
been
said
in
briefs
that
all
states
must
be
treated
alike,
your
honors
know
that
is
not
correct.
your
honors
have
had
the
three
leagues
and
three-mile
issue
for
you
before,
but
to
bring
it
home
precisely
to
this
point.
when
this
legislation
was
pending
before
congress
there
was
a
report
by
the
congress
which
we've
cited,
no.
2515,
which
deals
precisely
with
the
thing
i'm
now
talking
about.
it
said
that
congress,
not
some
representative,
not
just
the
senate,
and
no
matter
how
important,
but
the
congress.
there
is
a
startling
difference
between
the
shore
and
coast
of
louisiana
and
florida,
on
the
one
hand,
and
that
of
texas
and
california,
on
the
other.
to
say
that
these
contrasting
coastal
areas
should
be
treated
exactly
alike,
with
reference
to
the
definition
of
inland
waters,
would
ignore
geographical
factors
that
are
wholly
different.
we
respectfully
point
out
that
however
these
resources
are
used,
whether
they
come
through
louisiana
and
the
other
literal
states
or
whether
they
come
through
the
federal
government,
only
americans
can
have
them
but
it
would
be
a
tragedy,
we
think,
to
lead
any
foreign
nation
to
be
believed
that
these
shallow
waters
where
ocean-going
vessels
cannot
travel,
that
these
waters
between
the
passes
of
the
mississippi
river
are
international
waters
of
the
high
seas,
mr.
miller
will
take
for
louisiana.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
yes.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
i'm
victor
sachse,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court.
in
1960,
as
your
honors
know,
in
the--
in
an
earlier
stage
of
this
same
case,
your
honors
held
that
the
submerged
lands
act
of
1953
confirmed
or
put
claim
to
louisiana,
mississippi,
and
alabama
three
miles
from
their
cost
lines
while
put--
claiming
three
leagues
for
texas
and
florida.
in
your
decree,
as
in
the
submerged
lands
act
itself,
the
“coast
line”
is
defined
as
meaning
the
ordinary
low
water
along
that
portion
of
the
coast
which
is
in
direct
contact
with
the
open
sea
and
the
line
marking
the
seaward
limit
of
inland
waters.
this
court
retained
jurisdiction.
some
few
modifications
were
made
in
december
1965
by
the
united
states
but
the
coast
line,
although
it
long
ago
is
designated
and
defined
by
agencies
of
the
federal
government
directed
by
congress
to
do
that
very
thing
and
although
it
was
long
ago
accepted
and
approved
by
the
state
of
louisiana,
has
not
been
approved
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
so,
last
september,
we
filed
a
motion
to
have
the
court
recognize
it.
in
january,
the
attorney
general
responded,
opposed
recognition
of
this
line.
instead,
asked
for
the
recognition
of
the
line
according
to
his
interpretation
of
the
geneva
convention,
the
convention
on
the
territory
of
seas
and
contiguous
zones.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
we
don't
refer
to
it
as
the
coastguard
lines
because
it
was
marked
so
long
before
the
coastguard
had
anything
to
do
with
it.
we
refer
to
it
as
the
inland
waterline,
but
i'm
sure
we're
talking
to
the
same
thing,
justice
harlan.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
well,
we
use
it
and
we
refer
to
it
as
the
inland
waterline
because
the
congress
directed,
in1895,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
mark,
to
designate,
and
define
by
suitable
bearings
or
ranges
with
lighthouses,
light
vessels,
buoys,
or
coast
objects,
their
lines
dividing
the
high
seas
from
rivers,
harbors,
and
inland
waters.
and,
“inland
waters”
is
the
basis
of
this
issue
as
we
have
it.
it
is
the
basis
of
the
statute.
it
is
the
point
of
argument
between
ourselves
and
the
solicitor
general.
i
want
to
say
that
the
phase
of
the
argument
which
i
will
attempt
to
cover
relates
to
the
inland
waterline.
in
january
of
this
year,
the
solic--
the
attorney
general,
through
the
solicitor,
claimed
a
different
line
based
on
the
geneva
convention.
louisiana
started
to
leave
the
issue
right
there,
but
we
concluded
that
we
found
the--
that
line
wrong
also
and
that
incorrect
interpretations
of
the
geneva
convention
had
been
used,
as
we
understand
it.
so,
we
filed
in
may
an--
a
motion
for
an
ultimate
line.
mr.
jp
miller
of
new
orleans
will
speak
to
the
court
with
respect
to
the
lines
relating
to
the
geneva
convention
and
i
will
not.
there
is
no
dispute,
your
honors,
as
to
this
inland
waterline
as
designated
and
defined
by
agencies
of
the
federal
government
pursuant
to
the
1895
act.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
correct,
sir.
there
is
not
dis--
no
factual
dispute
about
its
existence
and,
therefore,
argu--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
that
is
right
and,
therefore,
the
argument
concerning
it
need
not
take
as
much
time
as
the
argument
about
any
line
under
the
geneva
convention
which
would
necessarily
involve
a
great
many
disputes
about
fact.
i
call
your
honors'
attention
to
a
statement
from
a
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
government
in
the
1956
stage
of
this
case,
in
which
it
was
said
to
the
court
that
louisiana
shore,
and
i
draw
a
distinction
between
shore
and
coast
as
we
go
along
in,
the
united
states
said
that
louisiana
shore
has
a
contour
so
nearly
leveled
that
even
minor
wind
variations,
and
your
honors
know
that
we
have
hurricanes
of
unbelievably
severe
power,
can
cause
various
substantial
differences
in
a
point
to
which
the
tide
retreats,
says
the
government.
the
shoreline
is
not
a
stable
one
and
that's
quite
true
and
quite
an
understatement
but,
they
added,
is
subject
through
most
of
its
length
to
rapid
and
substantial
changes
of
islands
may
be
moved
as
many
as
four
miles.
a
judicial
inquiry
for
the
precise
location
of
the
entire
shoreline
might
be
stretched
to
require
many
years
for
completion,
so
said
the
government
in
1956.
although
such
a
consideration
ought
not
to
be
necessary,
and
it
is
not
really,
in
our
opinion,
although
the
inland
waterline
was
designated
and
defined
long
ago,
has
been
marked
on
public
charters
published
to
the
world
and
not
challenged
and,
in
our
opinion,
ought
to
be
understood
by
everyone
to
be
the
outer
limit
of
inland
waters
as
used
by
this
court,
as
used
by
the
congress,
a
great
part
of
the
time,
allotted
to
louisiana
and
has
been
assigned
to
my
friend,
mr.
miller,
because
of
a
difficulty
in
discussing
factual
distinctions
with
respect
to
any
sort
of
the
geneva
line.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
the
1895
line
was
established
originally,
justice
harlan,
as
we've
tried
to
outline
in
our
brief,
because
the
congress
made
a
deliberate
decision
in
1885
that
it
would
prescribe
different
rules
for
the
inland
waters
of
the
united
states
than
for
the
territorial
sea.
and,
it
became
necessary
then
to
find
out
where
this
is,
where
this
was
then.
in--
your
honors
know,
of
course,
of
the
delaware
involving
the
channels,
getting
its
channel
to
the
harbor
of
new
york.
after
the
1885
act
was
passed,
before
the
1895
act
was
passed,
a
collision
occurred.
and,
this
court
in
the
case
of
the
delaware
had
to
consider
whether
international
rules
or
inland
rules
were
to
be
applied
to
the
case.
your
honors'
predecessors
said
then
that
the
1895
act
had
not
drawn--
1885
act
had
not
drawn
any
line,
and
to
quote
from
the
court,
“nor
could
any
general
legislation
do
so.”
but,
the
court
added,
the
congress
by
the
act
of
1895,
passed
since
the
occurrence
which
caused
the
case
to
be
before
the
court
had
arisen,
had
directed
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
to
designated
and
defined
the
line
and
he
had
done
so,
and
this
court
decided
that
the
inland
rules
marked--
declared
by
congress
applied
in
the
inland
waters
designated
and
defined
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
as
fully
as
if
new
york
harbor
itself
were
involved.
now--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
that
is
not
to
be
disputed,
but
from
that
or
with
that
flows,
in
our
opinion,
the
rights
of
territory,
the
rights
of
sovereignty
because
without
the
right
of
sovereignty
the
united
states
would
not
have
the
right
to
legally
declare
that
inland
rules
of
navigation
apply
to
foreign
vessels
within
this
line.
i
cite
you
to
collins,
in
his
work
on
the
subject
in
1949.
now,
louisiana
knows
that
whether
you
consider
this
as
the
coastline
of
the
united
states
for
all
references,
it
was
within
the
meaning
of
congress
the
coastline
where
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed,
and
i
used
the
verb
i
have
chosen
because
it
was
presented
to
congress
by
a
spokesman
from
louisiana
much
as
we're
presenting
it
to
you
on
this
year
today
in
1949
when
earlier
legislation
was
before
the
congress
and
before
the
senate.
in
respect
to
modifying
the
rules
of
the
first
california
case,
the
bill
is
then
pending,
referred
to
“shore.”
and,
louisiana
spokesman
stood
before
that
committee
and
said
that
“shore”
was
the
wrong
word
to
use.
“coast”
was
the
right
word
to
use
and
the
reason
“coast”
should
be
used
was
because
not
only
was
that
a
part
of
our
act
of
admission,
not
only
was
it
a
part
of
our
constitution
but,
more
closely
to
the
point,
congress
itself
had
used
the
word
“coast”
in
the
1895
act
in
undertaking
to
say
where
the
inland
waters
are.
and,
our
spokesman
then,
as
i
now,
call
that
act
to
the
attention
of
congress,
called
the
delaware
to
the
attention
of
congress
and,
from
that
time
on,
the
legislation
pending
used
the
word
“coast,”
“coastline,”
and
not
“shores.”
there
was
an
attempt,
while
the
submerged
lands
act
was
before
congress,
by
certain
senators
who
opposed
the
act
entirely.
there
was
an
attempt
by
the
then-attorney
general
of
the
united
states
to
have
the
congress
accept
the
idea
of
a
shoreline
instead
of
a
coastline,
but
this
was
rejected
and
the
idea
of
the
coastline
was
used.
now,
i
pass
to
another
phase.
immediately
following
the
act
of
1895,
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
began
to
mark
this
line
to
designate
and
define
the
line
between
inland
waters
and
the
high
seas.
as
directed
by
congress,
he
used
“coast
objects,”
which
means
to
us
“coastline.”
as
directed
by
congress,
he
used
“light
vessels
and
buoys,”
which
means
to
us
that
congress
knew
then,
as
it
had
known
in
all
of
its
earlier
acts,
that
at
least
the
part
of
the
united
states
had
its
coastline
in
the
water,
and
so
it
has
been
ever
since.
the
government
says
in
its
current
briefs
that
not
until
1937
were
there
any
indication
by
the
government
that
this
line
meant
something
different,
that
it
didn't
actually
divide
inland
waters
from
the
high
seas,
that,
after
that
time,
they
began
to
put
a
different
legend
on
their
charts
or
in
their
publications.
mr.
shalowitz
for
the
department
of
commerce
says
the
change
occurred
in
1948.
whichever
date
you
take,
the
fact
is
that,
by
that
time,
we
were
in
litigation
and,
by
that
time,
the
government
had
changed
its
position
of
not
claiming
any
waters
or
any
lands
beneath
submerged
waters
out
from
the
shores
of
the
states
and,
by
that
time,
you
were
heading
towards
your
first
california
decision.
and,
i
submit--
we
submit
that
change
is
made
by
the
government
in
its
treatment
of
its
own
publications
after
the
case
was
in
litigation
ought
not
to
bear
much
weight
with
the
court.
we
point
to
the
fact
that,
in
the
government's
brief
in19--
they
refer
to
the
fact
that
the
coastguard
commandant
who,
by
that
time,
was
the
officer
who
then
had
the
duty
formerly
possessed
by
the
secretary
of
treasury,
by
the
secretary
of
commerce
and
labor,
by
the
secretary
of
commerce.
now,
the
commandant
of
the
coastguard
has
it.
and,
when
he
finished
marking
on
the
charts,
not
designating
and
defining
the
lights
and
the
vessels
and
the
coast
markings
but
actually
physically
putting
a
line
on
the
chart,
he
did
make
a
statement,
in
which,
he
said
he
was
doing
this
for
navigation
and
he
was
not
undertaking
to
set
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states
or
of
the
states
or
of
the
jurisdiction
of
either.
we
don't
find
fault
with
that
statement
because,
at
that
time,
it
had
not
been
determined
whether
there
would
be
three
leagues
for
the
states
or
three
miles
for
the
state
or
some
for
one
and
some
for
another.
and,
the
commandant
may
have
been
trying
to
save
that
point
but,
whatever
his
intention
was,
he
had
to
conclude
as
the
congress
directed
him
to
conclude
by
saying
that
the
inland
rules
enacted
by
congress
related
to
the
waters
landwards
of
this
line
and
the
international
rules
of
the
high
seas
related
to
waters
seaward
of
the
line.
i
take
one
moment
to
point
something
that
mr.
miller
will
explain
to
you
more
carefully.
this
heavy
green
line
is
the
line
marked
by
the
agencies
of
the
federal
government
which
louisiana
accepted
in
1954.
this
rather
lighter
line,
dotted
line,
is
the
hundred-thousandth
line
of
the
continental
shelf
and,
for
a
long
time,
was
thought
to
be
the
edge
of
the
outer
continental
shelf.
all
of
the
area
in
between
is
area
that
is
exclusive
to
the
federal
government.
only
this
area
is
in
issue.
the
red
line
is
the
line
which
the
government
contends
is
the
coastline
and
which
so
nearly
follows
the
louisiana
shore.
i
come
now
in
some
haste
because
of
the
limited
time
allotted
here.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
you
mean
the
commandant
could
change
this
line?
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
this
is
not
our
position,
justice
brennan,
because--
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
we
think
that
if
we
are
correct
that
this
is
now
declared
by
congress
through
its
action
to
be
the
coastline
of
louisiana,
then
no
one
has
the
right
to
change
it
for
any
purpose
but,
certainly,
no
one
has
the
right
to
change
it
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
victor
a.
sachse
for
the
purposes
of
the
submerged
lands
act.
i'll
not
stand
before
the
court
and
say
that
they
are
not
mobile
boundaries
on
the
sea
that
as
land
moves,
as
land
builds
out
by
the
mississippi,
as
land
recedes
in
other
portions
of
our
shore
that
adjustments
will
not
have
to
be
made
some
time.
but,
so
far
as
the
submerged
lands
act
is
concerned,
the
congress
had
said,
first,
by
one
act
divided
into
two:
submerged
lands
act
and
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act
in
pursuance
of
the
truman
doctrine
of
1945,
nobody
but
the
united
states
is
going
to
have
any
of
the
minerals
on
mineral
resources
from
this
submerged
lands
on
our
continental
shelf.
now,
we
will
divide
that
between
the
federal
government
and
the
state
governments.
and,
they
did
it
in
the
fashion,
your
honors
know,
of
saying
either
three
miles
or
three
leagues
as
can
be
shown.
i
must
take
a
minute
or
two
on
the
california
case.
i
cannot
ignore
the
fact
that,
in
this
second
california
case,
when
the
lawyer
stood
before
this
court,
and
you
did
not
have
the
benefit,
justice
harlan,
of
any
such
light
as
this,
and
justice
brennan
and
justice
goldberg
asked
mr.
cox
whether
california
or
the
united
states
had
any
argument
to
be
based
upon
the
inland
waterline.
mr.
cox
said
no
and
california
didn't
dispute
it.
so
far
as
we
can
find
from
the
briefs,
so
far
as
we
can
find
from
the
report
of
the
decision
by
this
court,
there
was
no
mention
of
the
delaware
case.
there
was
no
mention
at
all
of
that,
yet
that
is
the
case
that
we
think
is
most
important
of
all.
your
honors
said,
through
you,
justice
harlan,
that
when
the
submerged
lands
act
was
passed
there
was
no
definition
of
inland
waters
because
the
managers
expected
that
earlier
decisions
and
earlier
acts
of
congress
would
supply
that
definition,
and
it
was
only
because
of
the
lack
of
the
section
of
a
definition
that
you
turn
to
the
geneva
convention.
and,
i
will
close
with
this.
if
it
be
said
in
argument
as
it
had
been
said
in
briefs
that
all
states
must
be
treated
alike,
your
honors
know
that
is
not
correct.
your
honors
have
had
the
three
leagues
and
three-mile
issue
for
you
before,
but
to
bring
it
home
precisely
to
this
point.
when
this
legislation
was
pending
before
congress
there
was
a
report
by
the
congress
which
we've
cited,
no.
2515,
which
deals
precisely
with
the
thing
i'm
now
talking
about.
it
said
that
congress,
not
some
representative,
not
just
the
senate,
and
no
matter
how
important,
but
the
congress.
there
is
a
startling
difference
between
the
shore
and
coast
of
louisiana
and
florida,
on
the
one
hand,
and
that
of
texas
and
california,
on
the
other.
to
say
that
these
contrasting
coastal
areas
should
be
treated
exactly
alike,
with
reference
to
the
definition
of
inland
waters,
would
ignore
geographical
factors
that
are
wholly
different.
we
respectfully
point
out
that
however
these
resources
are
used,
whether
they
come
through
louisiana
and
the
other
literal
states
or
whether
they
come
through
the
federal
government,
only
americans
can
have
them
but
it
would
be
a
tragedy,
we
think,
to
lead
any
foreign
nation
to
be
believed
that
these
shallow
waters
where
ocean-going
vessels
cannot
travel,
that
these
waters
between
the
passes
of
the
mississippi
river
are
international
waters
of
the
high
seas,
mr.
miller
will
take
for
louisiana.
