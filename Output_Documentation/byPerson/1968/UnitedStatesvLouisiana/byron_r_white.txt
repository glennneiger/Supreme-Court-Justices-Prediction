justice
byron
r.
white
you're
not
--
you
certainly
have
a
first
point
which
is
argued
yesterday?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
but
you
said
you
conceded.
you
conceded
you
have
to
accept
the
california
case
which
geneva
convention
applies?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
this
particular
--
these
particular
islands?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
--
but
applied
elsewhere
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
(voice
overlap)
concession
anywhere
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
that
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
page?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
map
is
that
in
our
packet?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
some
point
for
purposes
of
this
case
that
line
freezes
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
--
for
purposes
submerged
land
act
the
line
seizes
to
be
adjusted?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
position
of
united
states
doesn't
mean
that
the
waters
outside
its
coastline
or
shoreline,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
or
international
waters
in
the
sense
that
i
just
mean
just
the
territorial
sea?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
for
purpose
of
convention
the
convention
doesn't
say
how
far
the
territorial
sea
goes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
it.
they
say
that.(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
mean
the
convention
by
--
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
oil?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
exercise
of
control
over
the
bottom
of
the
sea
qualifies
an
act
of
sovereignty?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
did
they
--
for
caillou
bay
they
would
just
take
three
miles
from
around
the
island
or
three
miles
from
the
coast
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
from
the
shore?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
around
the
island?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
one
foot
water
depth
high
seas.
no,
it
isn't
the
high
seas,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
uh-huh.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
--
do
you
want
to
reserve
that
time
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
cox,
did
the
red
used
to
be
pink?
i
mean,
if
it
weren't
red,
would
it
be
pink?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
that
extent
then
it
would
be
--
would've
been
pink
even
if
it
weren't
red?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the
pink
--
is
this
what
you
concede?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
as
being
with
inland
waters?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
agree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
to
that
line
is
their
application
of
the
geneva
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
--
how
was
the
three
league
situation
observed?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
in
the
question
of
geneva
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that
was
a
historic
boundary
or
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
the
geneva
convention
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
neither?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
reason.
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
louisiana
insisted
that
it
should
be
drawn
in
this
lawsuit
perhaps.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
this
lawsuit
all
about
when
the
territorial
sea
starts?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
say
then
that
the
united
states
as
a
litigant
in
this
lawsuit
has
the
option
of
precluding
any
result
to
article
4?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
yes?
your
answer
is
yes
that
united
states
can
just
say
we
elect
not
to
permit
any
resort
article
4
in
this
lawsuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
important
but
just
in
terms
of
this
lawsuit
that
we're
concerned
with.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
--
that
may
be
true,
i
just
wondered
as
whether
or
not
there
was
any
issue
in
the
lawsuit
under
article
4,
i
take
it
there
is
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
answer
is
that
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
did
it
decide
in
the
california
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i've
got
the
opinion
here,
what
page
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
thanks
very
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
coastal
state
you
mean
the
nation?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
you
yourself
indicate
i
gather
that
even
this
assertion
was
questionable.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
was
an
assertion
of
something
i
mean
of
some
significance
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
structures
along
those
dredged
channels
are
anchored
in
the
bottom
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
these
aren't
just
buoys?
justice
byron
r.
white
every
hundred
yards
there
was
a
structure
anchored
in
the
bottom
of
the
ocean,
you
would
say
that
still
wouldn't
suffice
unless
they
we're
connected
above
the
water?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
cox
could
i
just
ask
you?
do
i
understand
it
correctly
that
those
red
areas
that
was
support
--
are
those
red
areas
are
more
than
three
miles
from
the
coastline
some
other?
justice
byron
r.
white
they're
all
within
three
miles
of
the
coastline?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
as
you
interpret
the
coastline
(voice
overlap)?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
true
of
that
little
red
area
in
east
bay?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
any
island?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
united
states
sticks
with
its
concession
on
the
east
there
on
those,
that
string
of
islands
going
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
another
--
that
would
be
another
i
suppose
assertion
by
the
united
states
beyond
three
miles.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
terms
of
the
geneva
convention.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
not
--
you
certainly
have
a
first

is
argued

justice
byron

conceded

justice
byron

white
how
about
this
particular
--
these
particular
islands?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
--
but
applied
elsewhere
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
(voice

concession
anywhere
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
that
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
page?
justice
byron

which

is
that

the

the
territorial
