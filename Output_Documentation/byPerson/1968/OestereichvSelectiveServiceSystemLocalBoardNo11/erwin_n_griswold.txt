mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
troublesome
case
as
i
see
it
though
it
involves
only
a
question
of
the
proper
application
and
construction
of
two
provisions
in
the
same
statute
and
acted
at
different
times.
although,
there
are
some
constitutional
questions
and
they
often
do
which
mr.
wulf
has
eluded,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
need
be
decided
here.
the
case
comes
here
in
an
extremely
short
record
consisting
of
nothing
but
the
complaint
filed
in
the
district
court,
an
affidavit
of
the
plaintiff
filed
in
the
district
court,
the
exact
status
of
which
here
i
don't
know
and
the
government's
motions
to
dismiss
the
complaint
are
based
primarily
on
the
provisions
enacted
by
congress
in
1967
as
section
10
(b)
(3)
of
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
a
record
it
seems
to
me
on
which
important
and
difficult
constitutional
questions
should
be
decided.
as
far
as
the
petitioner's
delinquency
classification
is
concerned,
we
know
virtually
nothing
in
the
way
of
facts
since
no
evidence
has
been
presented.
of
course
the
government
waives
this
by
filing
its
motion
to
dismiss
but
the
fact
remains
that
this
is
now
a
bare
bones
case
at
best.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
way
in
which
it
is
possible
to
treat
the
case
as
an
easy
one
as
was
done
by
the
two
courts
below
and
by
the
representatives
of
the
government
in
presenting
the
case
there
and
perhaps
that's
the
way
it
should
be
treated
here.
section
(10)
(b)
(3)
is
simple
and
clear
on
its
face,
it
says
that,
"no
judicial
review
shall
be
made
of
the
classification
or
processing
of
any
registered
except
as
a
offense
to
a
criminal
prosecution
after
the
registrant
has
responded
either
affirmatively
or
negatively
to
an
order
for
induction."
there
is
no
criminal
prosecution
here,
so
the
statute
says
that
there
should
be
no
judicial
review.
congress
surely
has
considerable
latitude
in
such
matters,
apart
from
special
circumstances
which
maybe
present
in
this
particular
case.
there
is
a
good
deal
of
basis
to
support
such
a
conclusion
and
this
is
in
fact
in
some
length
in
the
first
point
in
our
brief
at
pages
15
through
35,
counter
veiling
arguments
are
developed
in
the
petitioners
brief.
i
should
like
to
make
it
plain
that
we
do
not
regard
section
(10)
(b)
(3)
of
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967
as
invalid
on
its
face
or
anything
like
that,
where
there
are
no
other
factors
are
involved,
now
we're
prepared
to
advance
the
proposition
that
it
is
valid.
there
is
a
case
now
pending
before
the
court
on
jurisdictional
statement,
clark
against
gabriel
number
572
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
in
san
francisco,
where
one
of
the
judges
of
the
district
court
has
held
that
section
(10)
(b)
(3)
is
unconstitutional.
actually
there
is
a
division
on
this
question
among
the
district
judges
in
san
francisco.
some
have
held
that
section
(10)
(b)
(3)
is
unconstitutional
and
others
have
held
that
it's
valid
and
have
given
it
effect.
we
have
taken
a
direct
appeal
in
the
gabriel
case
where
the
decision
went
against
constitutionality
in
order
to
get
that
question
resolved.
i
state
this
situation
in
order
to
make
it
plain
that
it
is
not
the
government's
position
here
that
section
(10)
(b)
(3)
is
invalid
in
the
general
case.
the
problem
arises
here
because
of
special
circumstances
which
maybe
relevant
in
this
case.
when
we
take
another
look
at
section
(10)
(b)
(3),
its
clarity
becomes
less
evident.
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
lines
of
the
statutory
provision
as
it
appears
on
page
three
of
the
government's
brief,
we
find
that
judicial
review
can
be
had
only
"in
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution
after
the
registrant
has
responded
either
affirmatively
or
negatively
to
an
order
to
report
for
induction."
well,
now
just
what
does
that
mean?
how
can
there
be
a
criminal
prosecution
under
cection
12
of
the
act,
where
the
registrant
has
responded
affirmatively
to
an
order
to
report
for
induction?
for
this,
we
are
referred
to
the
legislative
history
and
it
is
suggested
that
this
is
to
leave
open
the
availability
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
after
a
registrant
has
accepted
induction
into
the
army.
but
that
surely
has
not
judicial
review
"in
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution."
obviously
the
statute
means
more
or
less
than
it
says
on
its
face
or
at
least
something
different
from
what
it
says
on
its
face,
were
thus
confronted
with
the
problem
of
statutory
construction,
dealing
with
a
statutory
provision
of
sweep
and
generality
without
explicit
qualification
to
exceptions.
but
subject
to
one
qualification
which
is
accepted
by
all
concerned
that
is
that
in
addition
to
criminal
prosecution
that
there
can
also
be
judicial
review
in
habeas
corpus.
it
should
also
be
observed
that
this
is
a
statute
which
is
a
part
of
a
comprehensive
statutory
provision
much
of
which
has
been
in
effect
for
a
long
time
and
different
parts
of
which
have
been
enacted
at
different
times.
sometimes
perhaps
without
full
attention
being
paid
to
the
articulation
of
the
several
statutory
provisions,
as
mr.
wulf
has
pointed
out
when
one
seeks
to
apply
section
(10)
(b)
(3)to
certain
types
of
cases,
constitutional
questions
loom
over
the
horizon.
these
are
two
sorts,
first
those
which
are
based
on
the
first
amendment
and
sometimes
referred
to
as
first
amendment
overtones;
and
second,
those
which
are
based
on
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments.
such
questions
arise
perhaps
most
clearly
where
as
here
the
so
called
delinquency
regulations
are
involved.
for
reasons
which
i
will
develop
a
little
later,
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
to
argue
the
whole
question
of
the
validity
and
the
affect
of
the
delinquency
regulations
in
this
case.
it
can
be
said
though
that
the
delinquency
regulations
are
not
as
clear
as
they
might
be.
it
should
be
observed
in
the
first
place
that
they
are
entirely
a
matter
of
regulation.
there
is
no
affirmative
grant
of
power
by
congress
to
deal
in
this
way
with
delinquents
except
that
it
can
be
said
that
the
regulations
have
in
a
way
been
ratified
by
congress,
by
a
provision.
first
appearing
in
the
1967
amendments
relating
to
the
order
in
which
registrants
are
to
be
inducted,
putting
delinquency
into
the
top
priority.
but
there
is
no
place
any
definition
of
delinquency.
obviously,
there
are
defaults
which
are
trivial
and
others
which
are
far
more
serious.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
or
the
regulations
which
spells
out
which
is
which
whether
a
person
is
in
fact
to
be
declared
a
delinquent
is
left
to
the
unfettered
judgment
of
the
local
board
guided
to
some
extent
by
general
statements
from
the
selective
service
systems.
that
is
mr.
wulf
has
pointed
out,
there
is
a
further
provision
in
section
1624.4
of
the
regulations
which
provides
that
a
registrant
who
has
been
declared
to
be
a
delinquent
maybe
removed
from
that
status
at
any
time
and
a
similar
provision
in
section
1642.14.
in
neither
case
though
is
there
any
standard?
there
is
no
provision
that
the
board
must
give
the
registrant
an
opportunity
to
correct
his
delinquency,
no
definition
as
to
what
actions
will
be
sufficient
to
lift
the
delinquency
classification.
all
that
the
regulation
says
is
that
the
board
may
remove
the
registrant
from
delinquency
status
but
it's
all
left
to
the
board.
whether
this
would
be
a
sufficient
standard
in
the
case
of
delegations
to
whether
types
of
administrative
agencies,
i
do
not
know.
whether
there
is
enough
in
the
case
of
the
selective
service
system,
i
need
not
in
my
view
be
decided
here.
the
eventual
problem
of
the
validity
of
the
delinquency
regulations
is
further
complicated
by
their
essentially
punitive
nature.
it
is
said
that
they
provide
a
sanction
which
is
analogous
to
civil
contempt.
if
that
were
the
correct
analogy
though,
the
delinquency
would
be
removed
whenever
the
registrant
brought
himself
into
compliance
and
he
would
have
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
do
so.
at
this
point,
we
encountered
general
hershey's
letter
and
memorandum
which
are
printed
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioners
brief.
if
this
is
a
penalty
or
if
it
is
being
used
in
a
punitive
fashion,
we
have
the
multiple
problems
that
there
was
no
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
no
right
to
council,
no
trial
by
jury,
and
indeed
no
trial.
perhaps,
there
are
answers
to
all
of
these
questions.
they
can
consider
in
another
case
when
that
becomes
necessary
and
hopefully
on
a
record
which
will
contain
more
facts
that
are
available
here.
although,
these
questions
need
not
be
considered
here
the
fact
that
we
come
close
to
them
is
it
seems
to
me
quite
relevant.
in
considering
the
question
of
statutory
construction
on
which
in
my
view
the
case
can
be
determined.
one
of
the
important
statutory
provisions
in
this
case
of
course
is
section
(10)
(b)
(3),
in
expressing
the
will
of
congress
that
there
should
not
be
litigious
interruptions
of
the
selected
service
process.
now,
section
(10)
(b)
(3)
is
clear
and
specific
and
unqualified.
i've
already
pointed
out
that
both
courts
below
felt
that
it
was
sufficient
to
dispose
of
the
case
after
urging
by
government
counsel
to
do
so
but
there
is
also
another
section
in
the
same
statute.
it
was
enacted
at
a
different
time
and
it
expresses
a
policy
which
has
been
in
all
of
our
selected
service
acts
for
more
than
50
years
at
least.
this
is
section
(6)
(g)
of
the
act
and
quoted
on
pages
3
and
4
of
our
brief.
under
this
provision,
"ministers
of
religion
and
students
preparing
for
the
ministry
who
are
satisfactorily
pursuing
full
time
courses
of
instruction
in
recognized
theological
or
divinity
schools
shall
be
exempt
from
training
and
service
under
this
title."
there
are
no
exceptions
or
qualifications,
such
students
shall
be
exempt
from
training
and
service
under
this
title
by
act
of
congress.
there
is
nothing
about
in
exemption
for
delinquency
or
anything
else.
congress
clearly
intended
that
such
students
should
be
exempt
as
long
as
they
maintain
themselves
as
full
time
students
in
good
standing
at
recognized
theological
schools.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
specifically
alleged
that
he
is
such
a
student.
this
is
in
paragraph
5
of
his
compliant
on
page
3
of
the
appendix.
by
filing
its
motion
to
dismiss
the
government
admitted
the
accuracy
of
this
allegation.
of
course
if
the
case
is
remanded
for
trial,
this
will
be
the
subject
of
proof
along
with
the
other
allegations
of
the
complaint.
how
can
these
two
strong
unqualified
provisions
of
the
same
statute
be
construed
together?
they
are
not
i
suppose
literally
inconsistent.
it's
perfectly
possible
to
say
that
section
(10)
(b)
(3)
can
be
applied
as
to
prevent
any
judicial
review
except
in
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution
and
to
await
that
event
for
the
application
of
the
equally
unqualified
section
(6)
(g),
that
is
verbally
possible
and
practically
it
seems
to
me
not
very
satisfactory.
for
the
exemption
from
training
and
service
under
this
act
is
clear,
on
refusing
to
respond
for
induction,
it
would
be
the
duty
of
the
attorney
general
responding
to
the
congressional
mandate
to
refuse
to
prosecute
the
petitioner
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
refused
to
report
for
induction.
and
if
the
attorney
general
did
seek
and
obtained
an
indictment,
it
would
be
the
duty
of
the
district
court
or
any
appellant
court
to
dismiss
the
prosecution.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
--
mr.
justice
it
is
not
a
crime
under
the
act
not
to
be
in
possession
of
the
registration
certificate.
it
is
--
well,
perhaps
i
should
qualify
that.
it
is
a
regulation
which
requires
possession
of
a
registration
certificate
and
it
is
a
crime
under
the
act
to
violate
the
act
or
any
of
the
regulations.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
no,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
that
kind.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
as
i
understand
that
subject
to
arguments
that
can
be
made
about
the
validity
and
effect
of
the
regulation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
one
comes
within
the
terms
of
a
statute
which
says
that
he
shall
be
exempt
from
training
and
service
under
this
act
and
the
other
does
not.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice
in
this
case,
the
allegation
is
that
he
did
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies.
there
is
no
problem
about
that.
my
position
here
is
applicable
only
to
the
case
of
a
person
who
comes
within
a
clear
and
explicit
exemption
provided
by
statute.
and
i
find
nothing
in
the
statute
which
authorizes
a
draft
board
under
any
circumstances
to
ignore
that
exemption
and
i
am
then
confronted
with
the
problem
of
construing
these
two
provisions
together
(10)
(b)
(3)
and
(6)
(g).
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
and
perhaps
its
equivalent,
what
i
suggest
he
can
do
is
to
challenge
the
order
to
report
for
induction,
which
is
what
he
has
done
by
this
suit.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
do.
and
i
think
he
could
not
simply
enjoin
his
prosecutor
for
a
crime
which
is
what
the
other
action
would
be
far
as
it
seems
to
me
that
the
combination
of
section
(6)
(g)
with
section
(10)
(b)
(3)
can
best
be
resolved
by
saying
he
is
free
to
raise
the
question
whether
he
can
be
validly
ordered
to
report
for
induction.
the
construction
of
these
two
provisions
which
would
let
(10)
(b)
(3)
have
full
operation
until
there
was
a
criminal
prosecution
is
in
my
submission
not
a
desirable
one.
this
court
had
a
somewhat
similar
problem
before
it
in
clark
against
uebersee
finanz-korp,
involving
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
which
has
a
somewhat
similar
history
of
comprehensive
statute
with
different
amendments
enacted
at
different
times,
and
the
court
said
that
its
task
was
to
give
all
of
the
statute
enacted
in
a
different
time.
the
most
harmonious
comprehensive
meeting
possible,
to
do
otherwise
would
be
to
impute
the
congress
or
purpose
to
paralyze
with
one
hand,
what
it
sought
to
promote
with
the
other.
but
the
result
would
be
in
other
cases
involving
different
provisions
of
the
selective
service
act
need
not
to
be
decided
here.
in
this
case,
we
are
dealing
with
a
divinity
student
who
has
expressly
exempted
by
section
(6)
(g).
in
the
light
of
that
fact,
in
the
whole
complex
of
factors
involved
here
including
the
constitutional
doubts
that
might
be
raised
here
both
under
the
first
amendment
and
under
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
with
respect
to
delinquency
reclassification.
the
two
statutory
provisions
can
best
be
reconciled
in
my
submission
by
giving
effect
to
the
exemption
contained
in
section
(6)
(g)
and
holding
that
section
(10)
(b)
(3)
must
yield
in
the
light
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
should
make
it
plain
that
it
is
the
position
of
the
selective
service
system
in
essence
that
it
is
section
(6)
(g)
which
must
yield
in
the
adjustment
of
this
two
statutory
provisions.
now,
i've
tried
to
summarize
the
arguments
to
this
effect
in
the
final
portion
of
the
government's
brief
and
i
know
that
the
court
will
give
this
its
careful
consideration.
i've
also
asked
that
they
be
distributed
to
each
member
of
the
court
a
copy
of
the
semi-annual
report
of
the
director
of
selective
service
before
the
six
months
ending
december
31,
1967.
this
includes
on
pages
10
and
11
a
statement
by
the
director
about
delinquencies
and
also
on
pages
21
to
23
a
summary
of
the
director's
views
particularly
with
respect
to
the
letter
which
he
issued
to
all
local
boards
in
october
in
1967.
for
what
its
worth,
my
own
conclusion
is
as
i
have
indicated
that
the
clear
and
unqualified
provision
for
exemption
in
section
(6)
(g)
should
be
given
effect
here,
thus,
making
it
unnecessary
to
consider
other
questions
including
constitutional
questions
which
even
argued
by
the
petitioner
and
which
may
come
up
for
decision,
and
some
later
case
which
does
not
involve
an
exemption
provision
such
as
congress
has
provided
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
now,
that
is
a
possible
construction.
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
find
any
trace
of
any
suggestion
or
evidence
that
congress
contemplated
when
it
put
that
one
word
in
the
provision
of
the
statute
referring
to
delinquency
that
it
was
thereby
repealing
the
exemption
for
ministers
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
mr.
justice
is
certainly
a
possible
argument.
to
me
it
is
just
too
slender
to
read
to
stand
on
in
this
particular
case
in
view
of
the
clear
language
of
(6)
(g)
and
its
long
continued
historical
background.
here
in
this
particular
case,
we
find
it
difficult
to
see
why
the
court
should
reach
a
construction
which
to
use
the
courts
words
in
estep,
requires
the
courts
to
march
up
the
hill
when
it's
apparent
from
the
beginning
that
they
will
have
to
march
down
again.
because
even
in
the
case
you
put
mr.
justice,
when
you
get
to
the
point
of
prosecution,
it
will
i
submit
while
(6)
(g)
remains
on
the
books,
remain
the
duty
of
the
attorney
general
not
to
prosecute,
and
of
the
course
to
dismiss
the
prosecution
if
one
has
began.
accordingly,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
a
trial
on
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
with
an
injunction
to
issue
if
those
allegations
are
adequately
proved.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
troublesome
case
as
i
see
it
though
it
involves
only
a
question
of
the
proper
application
and
construction
of
two
provisions
in
the
same
statute
and
acted
at
different
times.
although,
there
are
some
constitutional
questions
and
they
often
do
which
mr.
wulf
has
eluded,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
need
be
decided
here.
the
case
comes
here
in
an
extremely
short
record
consisting
of
nothing
but
the
complaint
filed
in
the
district
court,
an
affidavit
of
the
plaintiff
filed
in
the
district
court,
the
exact
status
of
which
here
i
don't
know
and
the
government's
motions
to
dismiss
the
complaint
are
based
primarily
on
the
provisions
enacted
by
congress
in
1967
as
section
10
(b)
(3)
of
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
a
record
it
seems
to
me
on
which
important
and
difficult
constitutional
questions
should
be
decided.
as
far
as
the
petitioner's
delinquency
classification
is
concerned,
we
know
virtually
nothing
in
the
way
of
facts
since
no
evidence
has
been
presented.
of
course
the
government
waives
this
by
filing
its
motion
to
dismiss
but
the
fact
remains
that
this
is
now
a
bare
bones
case
at
best.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
way
in
which
it
is
possible
to
treat
the
case
as
an
easy
one
as
was
done
by
the
two
courts
below
and
by
the
representatives
of
the
government
in
presenting
the
case
there
and
perhaps
that's
the
way
it
should
be
treated
here.
section
(10)
(b)
(3)
is
simple
and
clear
on
its
face,
it
says
that,
"no
judicial
review
shall
be
made
of
the
classification
or
processing
of
any
registered
except
as
a
offense
to
a
criminal
prosecution
after
the
registrant
has
responded
either
affirmatively
or
negatively
to
an
order
for
induction."
there
is
no
criminal
prosecution
here,
so
the
statute
says
that
there
should
be
no
judicial
review.
congress
surely
has
considerable
latitude
in
such
matters,
apart
from
special
circumstances
which
maybe
present
in
this
particular
case.
there
is
a
good
deal
of
basis
to
support
such
a
conclusion
and
this
is
in
fact
in
some
length
in
the
first
point
in
our
brief
at
pages
15
through
35,
counter
veiling
arguments
are
developed
in
the
petitioners
brief.
i
should
like
to
make
it
plain
that
we
do
not
regard
section
(10)
(b)
(3)
of
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967
as
invalid
on
its
face
or
anything
like
that,
where
there
are
no
other
factors
are
involved,
now
we're
prepared
to
advance
the
proposition
that
it
is
valid.
there
is
a
case
now
pending
before
the
court
on
jurisdictional
statement,
clark
against
gabriel
number
572
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
in
san
francisco,
where
one
of
the
judges
of
the
district
court
has
held
that
section
(10)
(b)
(3)
is
unconstitutional.
actually
there
is
a
division
on
this
question
among
the
district
judges
in
san
francisco.
some
have
held
that
section
(10)
(b)
(3)
is
unconstitutional
and
others
have
held
that
it's
valid
and
have
given
it
effect.
we
have
taken
a
direct
appeal
in
the
gabriel
case
where
the
decision
went
against
constitutionality
in
order
to
get
that
question
resolved.
i
state
this
situation
in
order
to
make
it
plain
that
it
is
not
the
government's
position
here
that
section
(10)
(b)
(3)
is
invalid
in
the
general
case.
the
problem
arises
here
because
of
special
circumstances
which
maybe
relevant
in
this
case.
when
we
take
another
look
at
section
(10)
(b)
(3),
its
clarity
becomes
less
evident.
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
lines
of
the
statutory
provision
as
it
appears
on
page
three
of
the
government's
brief,
we
find
that
judicial
review
can
be
had
only
"in
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution
after
the
registrant
has
responded
either
affirmatively
or
negatively
to
an
order
to
report
for
induction."
well,
now
just
what
does
that
mean?
how
can
there
be
a
criminal
prosecution
under
cection
12
of
the
act,
where
the
registrant
has
responded
affirmatively
to
an
order
to
report
for
induction?
for
this,
we
are
referred
to
the
legislative
history
and
it
is
suggested
that
this
is
to
leave
open
the
availability
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
after
a
registrant
has
accepted
induction
into
the
army.
but
that
surely
has
not
judicial
review
"in
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution."
obviously
the
statute
means
more
or
less
than
it
says
on
its
face
or
at
least
something
different
from
what
it
says
on
its
face,
were
thus
confronted
with
the
problem
of
statutory
construction,
dealing
with
a
statutory
provision
of
sweep
and
generality
without
explicit
qualification
to
exceptions.
but
subject
to
one
qualification
which
is
accepted
by
all
concerned
that
is
that
in
addition
to
criminal
prosecution
that
there
can
also
be
judicial
review
in
habeas
corpus.
it
should
also
be
observed
that
this
is
a
statute
which
is
a
part
of
a
comprehensive
statutory
provision
much
of
which
has
been
in
effect
for
a
long
time
and
different
parts
of
which
have
been
enacted
at
different
times.
sometimes
perhaps
without
full
attention
being
paid
to
the
articulation
of
the
several
statutory
provisions,
as
mr.
wulf
has
pointed
out
when
one
seeks
to
apply
section
(10)
(b)
(3)to
certain
types
of
cases,
constitutional
questions
loom
over
the
horizon.
these
are
two
sorts,
first
those
which
are
based
on
the
first
amendment
and
sometimes
referred
to
as
first
amendment
overtones;
and
second,
those
which
are
based
on
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments.
such
questions
arise
perhaps
most
clearly
where
as
here
the
so
called
delinquency
regulations
are
involved.
for
reasons
which
i
will
develop
a
little
later,
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
to
argue
the
whole
question
of
the
validity
and
the
affect
of
the
delinquency
regulations
in
this
case.
it
can
be
said
though
that
the
delinquency
regulations
are
not
as
clear
as
they
might
be.
it
should
be
observed
in
the
first
place
that
they
are
entirely
a
matter
of
regulation.
there
is
no
affirmative
grant
of
power
by
congress
to
deal
in
this
way
with
delinquents
except
that
it
can
be
said
that
the
regulations
have
in
a
way
been
ratified
by
congress,
by
a
provision.
first
appearing
in
the
1967
amendments
relating
to
the
order
in
which
registrants
are
to
be
inducted,
putting
delinquency
into
the
top
priority.
but
there
is
no
place
any
definition
of
delinquency.
obviously,
there
are
defaults
which
are
trivial
and
others
which
are
far
more
serious.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
or
the
regulations
which
spells
out
which
is
which
whether
a
person
is
in
fact
to
be
declared
a
delinquent
is
left
to
the
unfettered
judgment
of
the
local
board
guided
to
some
extent
by
general
statements
from
the
selective
service
systems.
that
is
mr.
wulf
has
pointed
out,
there
is
a
further
provision
in
section
1624.4
of
the
regulations
which
provides
that
a
registrant
who
has
been
declared
to
be
a
delinquent
maybe
removed
from
that
status
at
any
time
and
a
similar
provision
in
section
1642.14.
in
neither
case
though
is
there
any
standard?
there
is
no
provision
that
the
board
must
give
the
registrant
an
opportunity
to
correct
his
delinquency,
no
definition
as
to
what
actions
will
be
sufficient
to
lift
the
delinquency
classification.
all
that
the
regulation
says
is
that
the
board
may
remove
the
registrant
from
delinquency
status
but
it's
all
left
to
the
board.
whether
this
would
be
a
sufficient
standard
in
the
case
of
delegations
to
whether
types
of
administrative
agencies,
i
do
not
know.
whether
there
is
enough
in
the
case
of
the
selective
service
system,
i
need
not
in
my
view
be
decided
here.
the
eventual
problem
of
the
validity
of
the
delinquency
regulations
is
further
complicated
by
their
essentially
punitive
nature.
it
is
said
that
they
provide
a
sanction
which
is
analogous
to
civil
contempt.
if
that
were
the
correct
analogy
though,
the
delinquency
would
be
removed
whenever
the
registrant
brought
himself
into
compliance
and
he
would
have
to
be
given
an
opportunity
to
do
so.
at
this
point,
we
encountered
general
hershey's
letter
and
memorandum
which
are
printed
in
the
appendix
to
the
petitioners
brief.
if
this
is
a
penalty
or
if
it
is
being
used
in
a
punitive
fashion,
we
have
the
multiple
problems
that
there
was
no
indictment
by
a
grand
jury
no
right
to
council,
no
trial
by
jury,
and
indeed
no
trial.
perhaps,
there
are
answers
to
all
of
these
questions.
they
can
consider
in
another
case
when
that
becomes
necessary
and
hopefully
on
a
record
which
will
contain
more
facts
that
are
available
here.
although,
these
questions
need
not
be
considered
here
the
fact
that
we
come
close
to
them
is
it
seems
to
me
quite
relevant.
in
considering
the
question
of
statutory
construction
on
which
in
my
view
the
case
can
be
determined.
one
of
the
important
statutory
provisions
in
this
case
of
course
is
section
(10)
(b)
(3),
in
expressing
the
will
of
congress
that
there
should
not
be
litigious
interruptions
of
the
selected
service
process.
now,
section
(10)
(b)
(3)
is
clear
and
specific
and
unqualified.
i've
already
pointed
out
that
both
courts
below
felt
that
it
was
sufficient
to
dispose
of
the
case
after
urging
by
government
counsel
to
do
so
but
there
is
also
another
section
in
the
same
statute.
it
was
enacted
at
a
different
time
and
it
expresses
a
policy
which
has
been
in
all
of
our
selected
service
acts
for
more
than
50
years
at
least.
this
is
section
(6)
(g)
of
the
act
and
quoted
on
pages
3
and
4
of
our
brief.
under
this
provision,
"ministers
of
religion
and
students
preparing
for
the
ministry
who
are
satisfactorily
pursuing
full
time
courses
of
instruction
in
recognized
theological
or
divinity
schools
shall
be
exempt
from
training
and
service
under
this
title."
there
are
no
exceptions
or
qualifications,
such
students
shall
be
exempt
from
training
and
service
under
this
title
by
act
of
congress.
there
is
nothing
about
in
exemption
for
delinquency
or
anything
else.
congress
clearly
intended
that
such
students
should
be
exempt
as
long
as
they
maintain
themselves
as
full
time
students
in
good
standing
at
recognized
theological
schools.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
specifically
alleged
that
he
is
such
a
student.
this
is
in
paragraph
5
of
his
compliant
on
page
3
of
the
appendix.
by
filing
its
motion
to
dismiss
the
government
admitted
the
accuracy
of
this
allegation.
of
course
if
the
case
is
remanded
for
trial,
this
will
be
the
subject
of
proof
along
with
the
other
allegations
of
the
complaint.
how
can
these
two
strong
unqualified
provisions
of
the
same
statute
be
construed
together?
they
are
not
i
suppose
literally
inconsistent.
it's
perfectly
possible
to
say
that
section
(10)
(b)
(3)
can
be
applied
as
to
prevent
any
judicial
review
except
in
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution
and
to
await
that
event
for
the
application
of
the
equally
unqualified
section
(6)
(g),
that
is
verbally
possible
and
practically
it
seems
to
me
not
very
satisfactory.
for
the
exemption
from
training
and
service
under
this
act
is
clear,
on
refusing
to
respond
for
induction,
it
would
be
the
duty
of
the
attorney
general
responding
to
the
congressional
mandate
to
refuse
to
prosecute
the
petitioner
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
refused
to
report
for
induction.
and
if
the
attorney
general
did
seek
and
obtained
an
indictment,
it
would
be
the
duty
of
the
district
court
or
any
appellant
court
to
dismiss
the
prosecution.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
--
mr.
justice
it
is
not
a
crime
under
the
act
not
to
be
in
possession
of
the
registration
certificate.
it
is
--
well,
perhaps
i
should
qualify
that.
it
is
a
regulation
which
requires
possession
of
a
registration
certificate
and
it
is
a
crime
under
the
act
to
violate
the
act
or
any
of
the
regulations.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
no,
mr.
justice
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
that
kind.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
as
i
understand
that
subject
to
arguments
that
can
be
made
about
the
validity
and
effect
of
the
regulation.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
one
comes
within
the
terms
of
a
statute
which
says
that
he
shall
be
exempt
from
training
and
service
under
this
act
and
the
other
does
not.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
mr.
justice
in
this
case,
the
allegation
is
that
he
did
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies.
there
is
no
problem
about
that.
my
position
here
is
applicable
only
to
the
case
of
a
person
who
comes
within
a
clear
and
explicit
exemption
provided
by
statute.
and
i
find
nothing
in
the
statute
which
authorizes
a
draft
board
under
any
circumstances
to
ignore
that
exemption
and
i
am
then
confronted
with
the
problem
of
construing
these
two
provisions
together
(10)
(b)
(3)
and
(6)
(g).
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
and
perhaps
its
equivalent,
what
i
suggest
he
can
do
is
to
challenge
the
order
to
report
for
induction,
which
is
what
he
has
done
by
this
suit.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
do.
and
i
think
he
could
not
simply
enjoin
his
prosecutor
for
a
crime
which
is
what
the
other
action
would
be
far
as
it
seems
to
me
that
the
combination
of
section
(6)
(g)
with
section
(10)
(b)
(3)
can
best
be
resolved
by
saying
he
is
free
to
raise
the
question
whether
he
can
be
validly
ordered
to
report
for
induction.
the
construction
of
these
two
provisions
which
would
let
(10)
(b)
(3)
have
full
operation
until
there
was
a
criminal
prosecution
is
in
my
submission
not
a
desirable
one.
this
court
had
a
somewhat
similar
problem
before
it
in
clark
against
uebersee
finanz-korp,
involving
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
which
has
a
somewhat
similar
history
of
comprehensive
statute
with
different
amendments
enacted
at
different
times,
and
the
court
said
that
its
task
was
to
give
all
of
the
statute
enacted
in
a
different
time.
the
most
harmonious
comprehensive
meeting
possible,
to
do
otherwise
would
be
to
impute
the
congress
or
purpose
to
paralyze
with
one
hand,
what
it
sought
to
promote
with
the
other.
but
the
result
would
be
in
other
cases
involving
different
provisions
of
the
selective
service
act
need
not
to
be
decided
here.
in
this
case,
we
are
dealing
with
a
divinity
student
who
has
expressly
exempted
by
section
(6)
(g).
in
the
light
of
that
fact,
in
the
whole
complex
of
factors
involved
here
including
the
constitutional
doubts
that
might
be
raised
here
both
under
the
first
amendment
and
under
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
with
respect
to
delinquency
reclassification.
the
two
statutory
provisions
can
best
be
reconciled
in
my
submission
by
giving
effect
to
the
exemption
contained
in
section
(6)
(g)
and
holding
that
section
(10)
(b)
(3)
must
yield
in
the
light
of
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
should
make
it
plain
that
it
is
the
position
of
the
selective
service
system
in
essence
that
it
is
section
(6)
(g)
which
must
yield
in
the
adjustment
of
this
two
statutory
provisions.
now,
i've
tried
to
summarize
the
arguments
to
this
effect
in
the
final
portion
of
the
government's
brief
and
i
know
that
the
court
will
give
this
its
careful
consideration.
i've
also
asked
that
they
be
distributed
to
each
member
of
the
court
a
copy
of
the
semi-annual
report
of
the
director
of
selective
service
before
the
six
months
ending
december
31,
1967.
this
includes
on
pages
10
and
11
a
statement
by
the
director
about
delinquencies
and
also
on
pages
21
to
23
a
summary
of
the
director's
views
particularly
with
respect
to
the
letter
which
he
issued
to
all
local
boards
in
october
in
1967.
for
what
its
worth,
my
own
conclusion
is
as
i
have
indicated
that
the
clear
and
unqualified
provision
for
exemption
in
section
(6)
(g)
should
be
given
effect
here,
thus,
making
it
unnecessary
to
consider
other
questions
including
constitutional
questions
which
even
argued
by
the
petitioner
and
which
may
come
up
for
decision,
and
some
later
case
which
does
not
involve
an
exemption
provision
such
as
congress
has
provided
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
now,
that
is
a
possible
construction.
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
find
any
trace
of
any
suggestion
or
evidence
that
congress
contemplated
when
it
put
that
one
word
in
the
provision
of
the
statute
referring
to
delinquency
that
it
was
thereby
repealing
the
exemption
for
ministers
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
mr.
justice
is
certainly
a
possible
argument.
to
me
it
is
just
too
slender
to
read
to
stand
on
in
this
particular
case
in
view
of
the
clear
language
of
(6)
(g)
and
its
long
continued
historical
background.
here
in
this
particular
case,
we
find
it
difficult
to
see
why
the
court
should
reach
a
construction
which
to
use
the
courts
words
in
estep,
requires
the
courts
to
march
up
the
hill
when
it's
apparent
from
the
beginning
that
they
will
have
to
march
down
again.
because
even
in
the
case
you
put
mr.
justice,
when
you
get
to
the
point
of
prosecution,
it
will
i
submit
while
(6)
(g)
remains
on
the
books,
remain
the
duty
of
the
attorney
general
not
to
prosecute,
and
of
the
course
to
dismiss
the
prosecution
if
one
has
began.
accordingly,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
and
the
case
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
a
trial
on
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
with
an
injunction
to
issue
if
those
allegations
are
adequately
proved.
