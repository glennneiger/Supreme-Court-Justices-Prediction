justice
abe
fortas
that
was
just
a
pure
protest
case,
wasn't
it?
that
is
said
it
didn't
have
the
additional
element
of
divesting
himself
of
his
classification
incurred.
justice
abe
fortas
but
it
was
not
the
alleged
violation
of
a
statutory
duty
to
remain
in
possession
of
the
court.
justice
abe
fortas
probably
it
was
just
a
straight
protest,
a
demonstration
that
the
case—
justice
abe
fortas
well
is
it
a
crime
under
the
act
not
to
be
in
possession
of
the
registration
certificate?
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
well
then
do
you
mean
what
your
argument
leads
you
to
say
that
this
petitioner
could
not
be
prosecuted
for
the
crime
of
violating
the
regulation
which
requires
him
to
know
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
that.
justice
abe
fortas
because
the
statutory
exemption
extends
only
to
service
and
training.
justice
abe
fortas
so,
that
is
failure
to
be
in
possession
of
his
certificate
is
a
crime
for
which
he
could
be
punished
but
then
you
get
into
the
rather
well
anyway,
first
glance
or
rather
start
a
situation
where
the
petitioner
here,
a
ministerial
student
is
not
in
possession
of
his
certificate,
that's
a
violation
of
law.
a
non-ministerial
student,
not
in
possession
of
his
certificate
also
violates
law
and
they
could
both
be
prosecuted.
justice
abe
fortas
sure,
i
understand
that.
but
you
nevertheless
say
that
the
procedural
provision
in
the
statute
is
applicable
to
one
and
not
to
the
other,
that
is
to
say
that
judicial
review
cannot
be
obtained
except
in
certain
circumstances.
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
but
that
the
next
question
is
does
that
affect
the
jurisdictional
or
procedural
provision
and
in
the
statute
it
says
that
the
person
concerned
the
registrant
has
to
exhaust
his
administrator
remedies
or
whatever?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
but
in
effect
this
petitioner
would
--
because
he
is
a
ministerial
student
in
your
submission.
it
can
bring
an
action
to
challenge,
let
us
say,
the
validity
of
the
regulation
requiring
him
to
have
in
his
possession
the
registrations.
justice
abe
fortas
but
he
couldn't
challenge
--
he
could
not
challenge
the
regulation
requiring
him
to
be
in
possession
of
his
registration
stipulation.
if
i
may
clear
mr.
solicitor
general
which
is
bothering
me?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
that
if
you're
referring
to
the
1967
congressional
reference
to
delinquency
as
to
ratification
of
the
delinquency
procedure.
you
might
have
to
acknowledge
throughout
that
it
was
a
ratification
of
the
delinquency
procedure
across
the
board
that
is
to
say,
as
applied
to
ministerial
students
and
ministers
as
well
as
other
persons.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
the
congress
knew
from
this
reports,
i
suppose,
its
certainly
a
manner
of
public
knowledge,
general
knowledge
in
1967
that
ministers
of
the
gospel
have
been
classified
as
delinquent
by
selective
service
boards
and
in
1967,
it
did
include
the
prey
of
the
word
delinquency
and
if
its
an
enactment,
i
though
i
heard
you
at
the
beginning
of
your
argument
refer
to
the
possible
argument.
but
that
constituted
a
ratification
of
the
delinquency
procedure.
justice

fortas
that

justice

fortas

that
