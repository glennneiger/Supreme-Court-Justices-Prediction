(b)

before
the

said
only
that
decisions
of
the
local
board
shall
be
filed
which
was
the
statute
as
interpreted
in
falbo
and
estep
(ph).
there
was
no
statute
like
the
new
amendment
prior
to
its
adoption.
the
justification
that
the
government
or
rather
to
selective
service
system
has
put
forth
in
this
case
in
objecting
to
any
pre-induction
litigation
is
what
they
describe
as
the
litigious
interruption
of
the
functioning
of
the
selective
service
system.
now,
litigious
interruption
of
functioning
of
selective
service
system
was
put
forward
25
years
ago
in
falbo
where
the
question
was
whether
a
registrant
could
raise
questions
about
the
validity
of
his
classification
in
defense
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
justice
murphy
concurring
in
estep,
sorry,
in
dissenting
in
estep
said
of
the
government's
position
there
that
it
is
alleged
that
to
allow
a
full
hearing
and
a
criminal
proceeding
under
this
act
would
be
to
extend
an
open
invitation
to
all
inductees
to
disobey
their
induction
orders
and
litigate
he
validity
of
the
orders
in
the
subsequent
trials.
he
described
that
it's
a
poor
excuse
for
stripping
petitioners
of
their
rights
to
due
process
and
thought
that
it
was
a
speculative
concern
at
best.
now
falbo
specifically
said
that,
the
question
there
was
to
be
cited
in
the
context
of
a
wartime
situation
where
the
nation's
manpower
was
fully
mobilized,
that
was
also
the
background
of
the
estep
case
where
as
i
say
the
only
question
was
whether
selective
service
registrants
could
raise
their
defenses
on
the
criminal
prosecution.
now,
both
of
those
cases
arose
at
the
wartime
situation,
where
the
nation
was
fully
mobilized
and
where
it's
very
life
was
at
stake.
the
situation
is
entirely
different
today
where
there
is
no
declared
war
and
where
the
nation's
life
is
not
in
the
same
degree
of
jeopardy
as
it
was
there
in
the
second
world
war.
judge
zirpoli
in
the
northern
district
of
california
who
an
opinion
striking
down
10
(b)
(3)
on
the
ground
of
his
unconstitutional
also
address
himself
to
the
government's
claim
about
litigious
interruption
and
he
said
that
if
the
interruption
was
insignificant
if
it
exist
at
all.
he
said,
it
would
not
disrupt
the
selective
service
system
because
the
court
would
indeed
experience
and
that
saving
in
time
because
the
need
for
a
few
trials
would
be
obviated
by
voluntary
compliance
with
orders
which
have
been
judicially
declared
valid
and
sometime
will
be
saved
the
trials
because
the
issue
of
the
orders
validity
probably
will
not
have
to
be
litigated.
the
selective
service
system
also
says
in
its
portion
of
the
government's
brief
that
pre-induction
suits
will
interrupt
selective
service
because
they
are
generally
filed
within
a
few
days
of
the
induction
date,
that
happens
to
be
true
with
the
--
in
the
case
before
you.
it
doesn't
happen
to
be
true
in
the
general
round
of
cases
in
which
affirmative
suits
which
i
know
that
which
amount
to
about
20
have
been
filed.
most
of
those
suits
have
in
fact
been
filed
after
reclassification
and
before
exhaustion
of
the
administrative
appeals
process
during
which
time
an
induction
order
cannot
issue.
the
solicitor
general
also
says
as
one
of
the
government's
reasons
for
opposing
pre-induction
review
of
these
cases
that,
"if
petitioner's
induction
is
enjoined,
someone
else
will
have
to
take
his
place."
as
to
that
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
semiannual
report
of
the
selective
service
which
the
solicitor
general
has
filed
with
the
court
yesterday,
at
page
13,
"the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
should
petitioner's
induction
be
enjoyed?"
it
really
wouldn't
affect
the
selective
service
system
at
all
because
in
every
year
since
1949
in
the
table
at
the
bottom
of
page
13,
the
selective
service
system
has
over
booked.
they
got
a
--
they
--
in
1967
for
example,
the
defense
department
asked
that
they
induct
288,900
men
they
called
345,000
and
inducted
298,000
which
is
indeed
10,000
more
than
the
defense
department
had
requested.
i
also
want
to
say
solely
about
habeas
corpus
as
an
alternative
often
route
to
criminal
prosecution.
we
don't
think
that
habeas
is
really
an
effective
alternate
because
it
requires
that
the
man
go
with
he
service
and
perhaps
in
compliance
with
an
allegedly
invalid
order,
it
requires
that
the
subject
to
military
law
during
that
time
is
in
services
and
during
that
time
that
his
habeas
is
pending,
it
maybe
that
he
would
be
after
induction
be
transferred
along
the
distance
form
his
home
was
generally
be
the
case
away
from
his
friends,
away
from
the
witnesses,
away
from
the
local
board,
away
from
all
of
the
people
who
could
testify
in
his
behalf
which
would
in
fact
make
it
very
difficult
for
him
to
bring
an
effect
of
habeas
corpus.
and
also,
a
habeas
appeal
during
the
course
of
a
habeas
appeal,
he
would
have
to
be
subject
to
all
of
his
military
duties
is
contrasted
to
the
appeal
on
the
course
for
a
criminal
prosecution
or
a
civil
proceeding
where
he
would
not
be
subject
to
military
duties.
the
special
circumstances
in
this
case
are
seven.
now,
these
are
the
circumstances
which
we
urged
upon
the
court
as
a
reason
and
bases
for
granting
pre-induction
judicial
review
in
those
cases
where
the
board
has
acted
without
power
where
it
has
acted
beyond
its
jurisdiction.
there
are
seven
such
special
circumstances.
one
that
the
board
acted
contrary
to
the
statutory
exemption;
two,
that
the
board's
declaration
of
the
petitioner
as
a
delinquent,
his
reclassification
and
his
induction
was
unauthorized
by
the
statute;
three,
that
that
procedure
was
unauthorized
by
the
regulation;
and
four,
that
it
was
unconstitutional
because
it
subjected
its
petitioner
the
punishment;
and
five,
that
the
delinquency
regulations
are
unconstitutional;
six,
the
turning
in
the
registration
certificate
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment;
and
lastly
that
there
is
a
fact
that
independent
requirement
of
possession.

i
also
want
to
