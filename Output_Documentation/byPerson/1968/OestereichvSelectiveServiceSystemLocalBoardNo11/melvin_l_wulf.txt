mr.

mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
held
on
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
which
affirmed
decision
of
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
wyoming
dismissing
petitioner's
complaint.
now
the
facts
are
these,
petitioner
as
a
dually
enrolled
student
preparing
for
the
ministry
at
a
recognized
theological
divinity
school
had
been
classified
pursuant
to
the
military
selective
service
act
and
the
regulations
in
class
iv-d
by
his
local
board
in
1966.
class
iv-d
entitled
him
to
be
exempt
not
from
registration
but
from
training
and
service.
on
october
16,
1967,
the
petitioner
returned
his
registration
certificate
to
the
government,
"solely
for
the
purpose
of
registering
his
dissent
from
participation
by
the
united
states
in
the
war
in
vietnam
and
the
reasons
supporting
his
dissent
were
contained
in
an
affidavit
filed
with
the
complaint."
he
said
that
he
had
turned
in
his
card
as
an
act
of
collective
conscience
in
support
of
our
dying
and
suffering
brothers
who
are
presently
fighting
on
our
behalf
in
vietnam
and
as
a
responsible
expression
of
concerned
citizens
acting
in
light
of
the
first
amendment.
he
stated
his
belief
that
vietnam
situation
reveals
this
war
to
be
in
violation
of
most
of
the
criteria
of
the
"just
war
doctrine"
and
as
a
major
and
threat
in
security
and
peace
of
the
world.
upon
receipt
of
his
registration
certificate,
his
local
board
on
november
7th
about
two
weeks
after
he
had
turned
in
his
card,
mailed
him
a
delinquency
notice
is
a
stand
that
selective
service
form
notifying
him
that
he
had
become
delinquent
for
two
reasons:
one,
for
failure
to
have
his
registration
certificate
in
his
possession;
and
two,
for
a
failure
to
advise
the
board
of
his
current
status.
at
the
same
time
simultaneously,
a
notice
of
classification
was
sent
to
the
petitioner
advising
him
that
he
had
been
reclassified
i-a.
the
petitioner
appeal
to
the
state
appeal
board
which
affirmed
as
i-a
classification
on
december
27th
and
on
the
same
day,
the
local
board
sent
him
a
notice
report
for
induction
on
january
24,
1968.
suit
was
filed
on
january
19th
the
district
of
wyoming
to
enjoin
the
induction
and
to
require
petitioner's
reclassification
back
into
iv-d,
the
exempt
status.
on
the
22nd
of
january,
the
district
court
just
grab
the
government's
motion
to
dismiss
from
the
bench.
we
took
an
expedite
appeal
to
the
tenth
circuit
which
decided
--
which
affirmed
the
decision
below
on
february
21st
and
this
petition
for
certiorari
was
granted
in
may.
the
questions
on
this
case
are
all
of
first
impression.
for
the
first
time
since
the
adoption
of
the
conscription
in
1940
and
after
some
thousands
of
millions
of
people
have
been
conscripted
during
the
first
quarter
of
the
century,
this
case
brings
to
the
attention
of
this
court
some
of
the
low
visibility
machinery
of
the
selective
service
system.
the
actual
operation
of
this
selective
service
system
is
of
coursed
controlled
by
the
design
of
the
regulations.
and
we
believe
that
this
case
will
reveal
that
the
regulations
involved
in
this
case
don't
turns
where
constitutional
corners.
also
involved
in
this
case
is
the
high
visibility
of
the
national
directors
of
selective
service,
for
we
contend
and
the
government
has
agreed
the
general
hershey
effectively
invited
the
local
boards
around
the
country
to
uses
selective
service
system
as
a
means
to
punish
dissidents
from
national
policy.
and
he
thereby
not
only
punished
some
dissidents
from
national
policy
for
expressing
their
political
views
but
he
also
deterred
many
unknown
numbers
from
expressing
any
views
at
all.
the
threshold
argument
in
this
case
before
we
get
to
the
merits,
involved
section
10
(b)
(3)
of
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967,
a
new
provision
adopted
by
a
congress
in
1967.
it
reads
its
quote,
"no
judicial
review
shall
be
made
of
the
classification
or
processing
of
any
registrant
by
local
boards,
appeal
boards
or
the
president
except
this
as
a
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution
institute
under
section
12
of
this
title
after
the
registrant
has
responded
either
affirmatively
or
negatively
to
an
order
to
report
for
induction."
now,
the
government
has
--
the
solicitor
general
has
agreed
with
us
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
the
revocation
of
petitioners
for
the
exempt
classification
was
without
authority
because
it
was
contrary
to
an
express
grant
of
the
exemption
by
statute
by
congress,
and
that
for
that
reason
the
district
court
should
have
granted
the
injunction
and
required
petitioner's
classification
back
into
iv-d.
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
but
we
think
that
the
solicitor
general's
concession
is
too
narrow.
we
urged
upon
the
court
a
rather
broader
interpretation
of
10
(b)
(3)
the
one
often
described
as
the
"special
circumstances
exception",
a
doctrine
applied
to
statutes
which
have
recorded
either
to
deny
or
review
entirely
or
to
limited
in
one
way
or
another.
the
special
circumstances
doctrine
in
this
case
we
contend
that
i'll
come
back
to
a
more
detail
for
the
moment
is
that
the
local
board
acted
beyond
it's
jurisdiction
in
depriving
petitioner
of
his
iv-d
exemption
and
that
to
not
allow
petitioner
to
sue
to
regain
his
exempt
classification
will
needlessly
expose
himself
to
prosecution.
the
second
and
slightly
broader
ground
on
which
we
would
have
this
court
base
it's
decision
in
reversing
the
court
below
is
that
the
whole
scheme
or
all
of
the
events
surrounding
the
withdrawal
of
petitioner's
classification
violated
the
first
amendment
and
in
that
respect
we
rely
on
the
case
of
wulf
versus
selective
services
decided
by
the
second
circuit
in
1967.
now,
we
think
that
the
ccourt
without
getting
to
the
constitutional
issue
concerning
10
(b)
(3)
can
decide
the
case
on
either
of
those
two
grounds.
however,
we
also
--
we
argue
that
should
the
court
disagree
with
us
that
this
is
a
special
circumstances
case
or
take
the
position
that
the
first
amendment
was
not
reach
in
the
case
then
we
say
that
it's
necessary
to
examine
the
constitutionality
of
10
(b)
(3)
itself
which
seems
to
require
that
the
only
way
petitioner
could
test
the
validity
of
the
withdrawal
of
this
exemption
is
to
refuse
to
report
for
induction
and
to
defend
any
criminal
prosecution.
mr.

it
comes
from
a
fairly
long
line
of
cases
justice
harlan.
looked
at
the
letter
in
the
20's
which
was
a
tax
case
used
--
actually
used
the
expression
special
and
exceptional
circumstances.
in
other
cases,
during
the
1920s
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
miller
v.
standard
not
merge
and
other
cases
is
cited
on
page
38
of
our
brief.
but
more
recently
the
doctrine
if
not
the
actual
language
has
been
used
in
leedom
v.
kyne
and
a
national
labor
relations
board
case,
in
harmon
v.
brocker
question
of
the
nature
of
the
quality
of
discharge
given
to
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
and
in
a
number
of
immigration
and
naturalization
cases,
chauncey
v.
pirro
brown
lv,
of
weshank
and
russ
v.
court,
all
of
those
cases,
i'd
like
to
talk
just
for
a
moment
especially
about
leedom
v.
kyne
and
mccauley
v.
sociedad
that
which
are
labor
relations
cases.
both
of
those
cases
allow
affirmative
suits
to
be
brought
to
test
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
face
of
the
fact
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
provided
that
a
review
could
be
secured
only
by
review
of
a
certification
order
or
other
review
of
unfair
labor
practice
claim
by
the
board
and
those
would
of
course
initiate
equally
in
the
circuit
courts.
however,
in
these
two
cases
in
leedom
where
the
board
had
acted
in
flat
contradiction
to
a
statutory
provision,
this
court
will
allow
an
affirmative
suit
to
be
brought
in
a
district
court
and
in
the
same
in
the
mccauley
case
where
this
court
said
that
the
question
there
involved
international
repercussions
because
it
dealt
with
the
power
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
certify
foreign
flag
seaman
sailing
on
foreign
and
flag
vessels.
so,
the
special
circumstances
doctrine
is
one
that
has
been
applied
by
this
court
not
in
frequently
in
the
face
of
statutory
language
which
would
seem
to
either
deny
district
court
jurisdiction
or
to
limited
in
one
way
or
another.
we
also
rely
on
--
the
second
ground
in
which
we
are
in
this
court
to
permit
in
the
circumstance
of
this
case
pre-induction
judicial
review
is
because
of
the
compelling
first
amendment
circumstances
in
which
it
grows
and
into
that
--
in
those
circumstances
we
think
the
decision
in
wolff
v.
selective
service
decided
the
opinion
written
by
judge
medina
in
1967,
is
the
view
that
should
be
followed
by
this
court.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
was
a
protest
that
took
place
inside
the
office
of
a
local
selective
service
board,
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
the
local
board
thought
so
and
the
selective
service
been
thought
so
but
the
second
circuit
thought
not,
that
it
was
not
that
ground
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
it
was
two
--
it
was
a
two
wholly
actually
because
what
the
second
circuit
said
is
either
the
case
is,
one,
that
the
local
board
didn't
have
jurisdiction
to
reclassify
the
registrants
involved
in
that
case
for
in
effect
the
alleged
commission
of
the
crime.
secondly,
it
also
point
that
out
that
if
trial
reclassification
for
engaging
and
protest
of
any
kind
were
permitted
that
this
would
not
only
defend
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
particular
registrants
involved
but
would
also
deter
the
expression
of
first
amendment
rights
by
other
registrants
who
would
not
be
able
to
discern
the
contours
of
what
protected
the
speech
would
be
in
the
selective
service
context.
we
think
that
that
is
precisely
the
case
here.
we
think
that
petitioners
turning
in
of
his
card,
was
an
act
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
that
as
such
it
comes
within
the
scope
of
the
wolff
case.
as
i
said
in
my
introduction,
we
also
believe
that
10
(b)
(3)
if
applied
in
this
case
so
as
to
cut-off
petitioners
right
to
pre-induction
review
would
be
unconstitutional
but
i
don't
think
that
the
court
has
to
get
to
that.
if
it
does
we
address
ourselves
to
in
the
detail
in
the
brief
and
i
would
rather
go
on
to
the
delinquency
regulations
which
underlie
this
entire
case.
what
happened
here
to
petitioner
was
that
after
he
turned
his
card
in
and
when
after
it
was
received
by
the
local
board
they
declared
him
a
delinquent
under
the
selective
service
regulations
part
1642
that
that
whole
delinquency
procedure
is
most
peculiar
if
the
permits
the
locals
boards
to
do
practically
anything
to
any
registrants
without
any
standard
incident
without
any
standards
either
in
the
regulations
or
any
standards
delegated
by
congress
by
statute.
a
delinquent
is
defined
who
is
anyone
who
has
failed
any
duty
or
duties
required
of
him
under
the
selective
service
law
other
than
the
duty
to
comply
with
an
order
to
report
for
induction.
that's
the
total
sum
definition
of
someone
who
is
delinquent.
once
a
delinquent
is
declared
to
be
such
by
his
local
board,
he
maybe
classified
i-a
with
nothing
more.
if
he
is
classified
i-a
he
shall
be
inducted
--delinquent
reclassified
registrants
are
to
be
called
before
all
other
classes
of
individuals
before
volunteers.
they
need
not
get
a
pre-induction
physical
examination
as
is
required
for
all
other
volunteers.
lastly,
the
board
in
1642.4
(c)
is
given
the
power
to
revoke
the
delinquency
but
there
are
no
standards
about
how
they
do
it,
there
is
no
requirement
that
they
do
it.
it
just
says
that
a
registrant
who
has
been
declared
to
be
delinquent
maybe
removed
from
that
status
by
the
local
board
at
any
time.
now,
we
think
first
that
this
whole
delinquency
procedure
is
over
brought
in
the
due
process
sense
in
the
first
amendment
sense.
we
have
pointed
out
a
couple
of
examples
at
the
page
74
of
our,
sorry,
in
our
brief
at
page
74
of
the
kind
of
activity
that
was
subjected,
that's
subjected
registrants
to
delinquency
declarations.
one
man
was
declared
delinquent
for
setting
again
on
the
local
board
that
was
the
case
with
wolff.
another
man
was
declared
delinquent
for
peacefully
demonstrating
near
our
local
board.
another
man
was
declared
delinquent
for
distributing
anti-war
leaflets
during
selective
service
physical
examinations.
another
man
was
declared
delinquent
for
counseling
evasion
of
selective
service
law.
another
man
was
declared
delinquent
for
being
a
member
of
the
students
for
democratic
society.
and
another
man
who
just
recently
came
from
my
attention,
i
sent
a
copy
of
this
to
the
solicitor
general
by
mail,
out
of
colorado,
he
has
been
declared
delinquent
because
"of
your
activity
in
the
protest
march
in
december
1967."
any
regulation
no
less
any
statute
which
permits,
which
can
be
interpreted
and
applied
against
undoubted
first
amendment
protected
activity
of
this
guy
is
in
our
view
unconstitutional
under
the
first
amendment
because
of
its
overbreadth.
we
attacked
the
delinquency
regulations
is
not
only
for
being
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
but
also
because
they
are
not
authorized
by
the
statute
because
as
used
in
this
case
they
are
not
authorized
by
the
regulations
themselves
or
rather
as
used
in
this
case
were
unauthorized
by
the
regulations
and
also,
and
lastly
that
if
neither
of
those
two
suggestions
are
adopt
by
the
court
then
the
delinquency
regulations
are
unconstitutional.
there
is
no
authority
for
the
delinquency
regulations
in
the
statute.
there
is
an
acknowledgement
from
1967
of
the
delinquency
regulation
but
it
was
a
narrow
section
of
the
statute.
our
position
on
the
declaration
of
delinquency
of
petitioner
is
not
being
authorized
by
the
regulations
is
that
the
requirement
of
possession
of
a
registration
certificate
is
not
one
of
those
"duties"
required
by
the
regulations.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
discreet
information
gathering
function
necessary
for
classification
which
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
delinquency
regulations
to
enforce.
lastly,
we
say
that
as
applied
in
this
case
and
in
general
the
delinquency
regulations
are
unconstitutional
because
what
they
affect
to
are
punished
the
registrants
by
threatening
to
induct
them
if
they
do
not
comply
with
the
"duties"
of
the
selective
service
law
and
its
regulations.
i'm
afraid
i've
run
out
time
your
honors.
i
do
want
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
we
have
other
arguments
relating
to
the
first
amendment
particularly
but
i
do
urged
upon
the
court
that
in
our
view
the
most
important
aspect
of
this
is
the
invalid
delinquency
procedure
which
we
do
described
some
length
in
out
brief.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
i
want
only
to
say
that,
we
think
that
the
facts
as
alleged
to
complaint
or
simple
stark
uncluttered.
they
are
fact
the
facts
of
the
case
and
adequate
for
the
court
to
reach
the
constitutional
issues
in
its
--
this
case
which
we
believe
the
court
must.
thank
you.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
held
on
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
which
affirmed
decision
of
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
wyoming
dismissing
petitioner's
complaint.
now
the
facts
are
these,
petitioner
as
a
dually
enrolled
student
preparing
for
the
ministry
at
a
recognized
theological
divinity
school
had
been
classified

entitled
him
to
be
exempt
not
from
registration
but
from
training
and
service.
on
october
16,
1967,
the
petitioner
returned
his
registration
certificate
to
the
government,
"solely
for
the
purpose
of
registering
his
dissent
from
participation
by
the
united
states
in
the
war
in
vietnam
and
the
reasons
supporting
his
dissent
were
contained
in
an
affidavit
filed
with
the
complaint."
he
said
that
he
had
turned
in
his
card
as
an
act
of
collective
conscience
in
support
of
our
dying
and
suffering
brothers
who
are
presently
fighting
on
our
behalf
in
vietnam
and
as
a
responsible
expression
of
concerned
citizens
acting
in
light
of
the
first
amendment.
he
stated
his
belief
that
vietnam
situation
reveals
this
war
to
be
in
violation
of
most
of
the
criteria
of
the
"just
war
doctrine"
and
as
a
major
and
threat
in
security
and
peace
of
the
world.
upon
receipt
of
his
registration
certificate,
his
local
board
on
november
7th
about
two
weeks
after
he
had
turned
in
his
card,
mailed
him
a
delinquency
notice
is
a
stand
that
selective
service
form
notifying
him
that
he
had
become
delinquent
for
two
reasons:
one,
for
failure
to
have
his
registration
certificate
in
his
possession;
and
two,
for
a
failure
to
advise
the
board
of
his
current
status.
at
the
same
time
simultaneously,
a
notice
of
classification
was
sent
to
the
petitioner
advising
him
that
he
had
been
reclassified

the
petitioner
appeal
to

affirmed
as

on

and

day,

the
district
of
wyoming
to
enjoin
the
induction
and
to
require
petitioner's
reclassification
back
into
iv-d,
the
exempt
status.
on
the
22nd
of
january,
the
district
court
just
grab
the
government's
motion
to
dismiss
from
the
bench.
we
took
an
expedite
appeal
to
the
tenth
circuit
which
decided
--
which
affirmed
the
decision
below
on
february
21st
and
this
petition
for
certiorari
was
granted
in
may.
the
questions
on
this
case
are
all
of
first
impression.
for
the
first
time
since
the
adoption
of
the
conscription
in
1940
and
after
some
thousands
of
millions
of
people
have
been
conscripted
during
the
first
quarter
of
the
century,
this
case
brings
to
the
attention
of
this
court
some
of
the
low
visibility
machinery
of
the
selective
service
system.
the
actual
operation
of
this
selective
service
system
is
of
coursed
controlled
by
the
design
of
the
regulations.
and
we
believe
that
this
case
will
reveal
that
the
regulations
involved
in
this
case
don't
turns
where
constitutional
corners.
also
involved
in
this
case
is
the
high
visibility
of
the
national
directors
of
selective
service,
for
we
contend
and
the
government
has
agreed
the
general
hershey
effectively
invited
the
local
boards
around
the
country
to
uses
selective
service
system
as
a
means
to
punish
dissidents
from
national
policy.
and
he
thereby
not
only
punished
some
dissidents
from
national
policy
for
expressing
their
political
views
but
he
also
deterred
many
unknown
numbers
from
expressing
any
views
at
all.
the
threshold
argument
in
this
case
before
we
get
to
the
merits,
involved
section
10
(b)
(3)
of
the
military
selective
service
act
of
1967,
a
new
provision
adopted
by
a
congress
in
1967.
it
reads
its
quote,
"no
judicial
review
shall
be
made
of
the
classification
or
processing
of
any
registrant
by
local
boards,
appeal
boards
or
the
president
except
this
as
a
defense
to
a
criminal
prosecution
institute
under
section
12
of
this
title
after
the
registrant
has
responded
either
affirmatively
or
negatively
to
an
order
to
report
for
induction."
now,
the
government
has
--
the
solicitor
general
has
agreed
with
us
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
the
revocation
of
petitioners
for
the
exempt
classification
was
without
authority
because
it
was
contrary
to
an
express
grant
of
the
exemption
by
statute
by
congress,
and
that
for
that
reason
the
district
court
should
have
granted
the
injunction
and
required
petitioner's
classification
back
into
iv-d.
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
but
we
think
that
the
solicitor
general's
concession
is
too
narrow.
we
urged
upon
the
court
a
rather
broader
interpretation
of
10
(b)
(3)
the
one
often
described
as
the
"special
circumstances
exception",
a
doctrine
applied
to
statutes
which
have
recorded
either
to
deny
or
review
entirely
or
to
limited
in
one
way
or
another.
the
special
circumstances
doctrine
in
this
case
we
contend
that
i'll
come
back
to
a
more
detail
for
the
moment
is
that
the
local
board
acted
beyond
it's
jurisdiction
in
depriving
petitioner
of
his
iv-d
exemption
and
that
to
not
allow
petitioner
to
sue
to
regain
his
exempt
classification
will
needlessly
expose
himself
to
prosecution.
the
second
and
slightly
broader
ground
on
which
we
would
have
this
court
base
it's
decision
in
reversing
the
court
below
is
that
the
whole
scheme
or
all
of
the
events
surrounding
the
withdrawal
of
petitioner's
classification
violated
the
first
amendment
and
in
that
respect
we
rely
on
the
case
of
wulf
versus
selective
services
decided
by
the
second
circuit
in
1967.
now,
we
think
that
the
ccourt
without
getting
to
the
constitutional
issue
concerning
10
(b)
(3)
can
decide
the
case
on
either
of
those
two
grounds.
however,
we
also
--
we
argue
that
should
the
court
disagree
with
us
that
this
is
a
special
circumstances
case
or
take
the
position
that
the
first
amendment
was
not
reach
in
the
case
then
we
say
that
it's
necessary
to
examine
the
constitutionality
of
10
(b)
(3)
itself
which
seems
to
require
that
the
only
way
petitioner
could
test
the
validity
of
the
withdrawal
of
this
exemption
is
to
refuse
to
report
for
induction
and
to
defend
any
criminal
prosecution.

line

justice

looked
at
the
letter
in
the
20's
which
was
a
tax
case
used
--
actually
used
the
expression
special
and
exceptional
circumstances.
in
other
cases,
during
the
1920s
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
the
miller
v.
standard
not
merge
and
other
cases
is
cited
on
page
38
of
our
brief.
but
more
recently
the
doctrine
if
not
the
actual
language
has
been
used
in
leedom
v.
kyne
and
a
national
labor
relations
board
case,
in
harmon
v.
brocker
question
of
the
nature
of
the
quality
of
discharge
given
to
a
member
of
the
armed
forces
and
in
a
number
of
immigration
and
naturalization
cases,
chauncey
v.
pirro
brown
lv,
of
weshank
and
russ
v.
court,
all
of
those
cases,
i'd
like
to
talk
just
for
a
moment
especially
about
leedom
v.
kyne
and
mccauley
v.
sociedad
that
which
are
labor
relations
cases.
both
of
those
cases
allow
affirmative
suits
to
be
brought
to
test
the
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
face
of
the
fact
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
provided
that
a
review
could
be
secured
only
by
review
of
a
certification
order
or
other
review
of
unfair
labor
practice
claim
by
the
board
and
those
would
of
course
initiate
equally
in
the
circuit
courts.
however,
in
these
two
cases
in
leedom
where
the
board
had
acted
in
flat
contradiction
to
a
statutory
provision,
this
court
will
allow
an
affirmative
suit
to
be
brought
in
a
district
court
and
in
the
same
in
the
mccauley
case
where
this
court
said
that
the
question
there
involved
international
repercussions
because
it
dealt
with
the
power
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
certify
foreign
flag
seaman
sailing
on
foreign
and
flag
vessels.
so,
the
special
circumstances
doctrine
is
one
that
has
been
applied
by
this
court
not
in
frequently
in
the
face
of
statutory
language
which
would
seem
to
either
deny
district
court
jurisdiction
or
to
limited
in
one
way
or
another.
we
also
rely
on
--
the
second
ground
in
which
we
are
in
this
court
to
permit
in
the
circumstance
of
this
case
pre-induction
judicial
review
is
because
of
the
compelling
first
amendment
circumstances
in
which
it
grows
and
into
that
--
in
those
circumstances
we
think
the
decision
in
wolff
v.
selective
service
decided
the
opinion
written
by
judge
medina
in
1967,
is
the
view
that
should
be
followed
by
this
court.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
it
was
a
protest
that
took
place
inside
the
office
of
a
local
selective
service
board,
yes.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
the
local
board
thought
so
and
the
selective
service
been
thought
so
but
the
second
circuit
thought
not,
that
it
was
not
that
ground
--
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
well,
it
was
two
--
it
was
a
two
wholly
actually
because
what
the
second
circuit
said
is
either
the
case
is,
one,
that
the
local
board
didn't
have
jurisdiction
to
reclassify
the
registrants
involved
in
that
case
for
in
effect
the
alleged
commission
of
the
crime.
secondly,
it
also
point
that
out
that
if
trial
reclassification
for
engaging
and
protest
of
any
kind
were
permitted
that
this
would
not
only
defend
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
particular
registrants
involved
but
would
also
deter
the
expression
of
first
amendment
rights
by
other
registrants
who
would
not
be
able
to
discern
the
contours
of
what
protected
the
speech
would
be
in
the
selective
service
context.
we
think
that
that
is
precisely
the
case
here.
we
think
that
petitioners
turning
in
of
his
card,
was
an
act
protected
by
the
first
amendment
and
that
as
such
it
comes
within
the
scope
of
the
wolff
case.
as
i
said
in
my
introduction,
we
also
believe
that
10
(b)
(3)
if
applied
in
this
case
so
as
to
cut-off
petitioners
right
to
pre-induction
review
would
be
unconstitutional
but
i
don't
think
that
the
court
has
to
get
to
that.
if
it
does
we
address
ourselves
to
in
the
detail
in
the
brief
and
i
would
rather
go
on
to
the
delinquency
regulations
which
underlie
this
entire
case.
what
happened
here
to
petitioner
was
that
after
he
turned
his
card
in
and
when
after
it
was
received
by
the
local
board
they
declared
him
a
delinquent
under
the
selective
service
regulations
part
1642
that
that
whole
delinquency
procedure
is
most
peculiar
if
the
permits
the
locals
boards
to
do
practically
anything
to
any
registrants
without
any
standard
incident
without
any
standards
either
in
the
regulations
or
any
standards
delegated
by
congress
by
statute.
a
delinquent
is
defined
who
is
anyone
who
has
failed
any
duty
or
duties
required
of
him
under
the
selective
service
law
other
than
the
duty
to
comply
with
an
order
to
report
for
induction.
that's
the
total
sum
definition
of
someone
who
is
delinquent.
once
a
delinquent
is
declared
to
be
such
by
his
local
board,
he
maybe
classified
i-a
with
nothing
more.
if
he
is
classified
i-a
he
shall
be
inducted
--delinquent
reclassified
registrants
are
to
be
called
before
all
other
classes
of
individuals
before
volunteers.
they
need
not
get
a
pre-induction
physical
examination
as
is
required
for
all
other
volunteers.
lastly,
the
board
in
1642.4
(c)
is
given
the
power
to
revoke
the
delinquency
but
there
are
no
standards
about
how
they
do
it,
there
is
no
requirement
that
they
do
it.
it
just
says
that
a
registrant
who
has
been
declared
to
be
delinquent
maybe
removed
from
that
status
by
the
local
board
at
any
time.
now,
we
think
first
that
this
whole
delinquency
procedure
is
over
brought
in
the
due
process
sense
in
the
first
amendment
sense.
we
have
pointed
out
a
couple
of
examples
at
the
page
74
of
our,
sorry,
in
our
brief
at
page
74
of
the
kind
of
activity
that
was
subjected,
that's
subjected
registrants
to
delinquency
declarations.
one
man
was
declared
delinquent
for
setting
again
on
the
local
board
that
was
the
case
with
wolff.
another
man
was
declared
delinquent
for
peacefully
demonstrating
near
our
local
board.
another
man
was
declared
delinquent
for
distributing
anti-war
leaflets
during
selective
service
physical
examinations.
another
man
was
declared
delinquent
for
counseling
evasion
of
selective
service
law.
another
man
was
declared
delinquent
for
being
a
member
of
the
students
for
democratic
society.
and
another
man
who
just
recently
came
from
my
attention,
i
sent
a
copy
of
this
to
the
solicitor
general
by
mail,
out
of
colorado,
he
has
been
declared
delinquent
because
"of
your
activity
in
the
protest
march
in
december
1967."
any
regulation
no
less
any
statute
which
permits,
which
can
be
interpreted
and
applied
against
undoubted
first
amendment
protected
activity
of
this
guy
is
in
our
view
unconstitutional
under
the
first
amendment
because
of
its
overbreadth.
we
attacked
the
delinquency
regulations
is
not
only
for
being
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
but
also
because
they
are
not
authorized
by
the
statute
because
as
used
in
this
case
they
are
not
authorized
by
the
regulations
themselves
or
rather
as
used
in
this
case
were
unauthorized
by
the
regulations
and
also,
and
lastly
that
if
neither
of
those
two
suggestions
are
adopt
by
the
court
then
the
delinquency
regulations
are
unconstitutional.
there
is
no
authority
for
the
delinquency
regulations
in
the
statute.
there
is
an
acknowledgement
from
1967
of
the
delinquency
regulation
but
it
was
a
narrow
section
of
the
statute.
our
position
on
the
declaration
of
delinquency
of
petitioner
is
not
being
authorized
by
the
regulations
is
that
the
requirement
of
possession
of
a
registration
certificate
is
not
one
of
those
"duties"
required
by
the
regulations.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
discreet
information
gathering
function
necessary
for
classification
which
it
is
the
purpose
of
the
delinquency
regulations
to
enforce.
lastly,
we
say
that
as
applied
in
this
case
and
in
general
the
delinquency
regulations
are
unconstitutional
because
what
they
affect
to
are
punished
the
registrants
by
threatening
to
induct
them
if
they
do
not
comply
with
the
"duties"
of
the
selective
service
law
and
its
regulations.
i'm
afraid
i've
run
out
time
your
honors.
i
do
want
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
we
have
other
arguments
relating
to
the
first
amendment
particularly
but
i
do
urged
upon
the
court
that
in
our
view
the
most
important
aspect
of
this
is
the
invalid
delinquency
procedure
which
we
do
described
some
length
in
out
brief.
mr.
melvin
l.
wulf
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court.
i
want
only
to
say
that,
we
think
that
the
facts
as
alleged
to
complaint
or
simple
stark
uncluttered.
they
are
fact
the
facts
of
the
case
and
adequate
for
the
court
to
reach
the
constitutional
issues
in
its
--
this
case
which
we
believe
the
court
must.
thank
you.
