area
of
these
two
buildings
and
you
have
them
marked
with
diagonal
lines
across
them
like
that.
do
you

what
i
mean?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
what
damage
was
done
to
those
blocks,
not
any
particular
building
but
those
blocks
other
than
the
--
other
than
in
those
two
buildings?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
three
buildings;
i'm
talking
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
about
this
general
area
that's
--
has
those
diagonal
lines
on
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
other
than
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
just
those
three?
chief
justice
earl
warren
those
three
buildings.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
the
hash
lines
going
down
bolivar
avenue
or
just
marked
the
boundary
line
of
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that
--
those
are
not
buildings
or
any
area
of
destruction
or
anything
else.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
can't
read
your
legend
from
here
but
what
is
that
mean,
those
diagonal
lines?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
yes,
thank
you.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
may
mr.
jacks.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
strauss.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
strauss
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
when
the
troops
went
there,
they
intended
to
use
the
ymca
building
or
the
masonic
temple
as
a
rendezvous
for
the
troops?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jacks
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
contend
do
you
mr.
jacks
that
when
the
troops
went
there,
they
selected
by
pre-meditation
this
two
structures
saying
this
are
the
places
where
we
will
defend
this
whole
area.
now,
just
let
me
finish
please.
what
--
is
it
the
fact
that
on
the
contrary,
as
far
as
this
record
shows,
they
made
no
decision
to
go
into
the
buildings.
either
of
them
until
they
went
in
under
extremist,
with
--
when
one
soldier
having
been
killed,
others
having
been
wounded
and
the
rioters
were
in
the
building
and
it
was
under
those
compulsions
that
they
went
into
the
building,
is
--
am
i
correct
on
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
no,
no
but
have
you
any
right
to
assume
under
the
--
under
what
is
in
the
record
that
they
did
go
there
with
a
premeditated
intention
of
using
those
two
places
as
a
rendezvous
or
as
a
defense
points
for
that
area?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
on
the
contrary,
one
soldier
was
killed
right
at
the
entrance
to
the
building
before
they
went
in.
others
were
wounded,
the
rioters
were
in
the
building
and
they
went
in
both
for
protection
of
themselves
and
i
assume
for
the
protection
of
the
building.
now
is
there
anything
wrong
with
the
--
those
facts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
you
expect
them
to
do?
go
out
into
the
line
of
fire
then,
get
some
more
killed?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
think
you
do
because
you
claim
they
were
doing
it
for
a
purpose
other
than
to
defend
the
area
and
defend
the
people
in
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
yes,
of
course.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
would
have
happened
if
the
army
hadn't
put
it
out
with
the
rioters
in
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
i
may
hadn't
have
gone
in
there
to
use
--
to
defend
themselves.
what
would
have
happened
to
that
building
if
they
haven't
gone
in
there
and
done
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
in
--
our
general
nature
was
done
--
was
the
damage
to
this
building,
to
either
of
them?
chief
justice
earl

was
that
from
