mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioners
seek
to
recover
from
the
united
states
in
this
case
the
value,
not
of
the
use
of
their
buildings
but
of
the
damage
which
rioters
inflicted
on
those
buildings
during
the
course
of
general
anti-american
riots
in
the
canal
zone.
the
president,
the
congress
and
this
court
have
unanimously
agreed
on
the
legal
principle
which
ought
to
apply
in
that
situation
and
i
should
like
to
quote
it.
it
is
a
general
principle
of
both
international
and
municipal
law
that
all
properties
held
subject
not
only
to
be
taken
by
the
government
for
public
uses,
in
which
case,
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
the
owner
is
entitled
to
just
compensation.
but
also
subject
to
be
temporarily
occupied,
which
is
this
case
or
even
actually
destroyed,
which
is
perhaps
caltex
is
not
involved
here.
in
times
of
great
public
danger
and
when
the
public
safety
demands
it.
and
in
this
latter
case,
governments
do
not
admit
a
legal
obligation
on
their
part
to
compensate
the
owner.
that
statement
as
the
court
may
recognize
from
the
court
of
claims'
opinion
in
this
case
originated
in
the
veto
message
from
president
grant
to
the
congress.
it
was
then
quoted
with
approval
in
the
lawrence
report,
house
report
134
of
the
43rd
congress,
second
session,
which
is
the
most
thorough
congressional
study
ever
undertaken
of
government
liability
or
damage
claims
and
which
is
acquired
independent
stature
as
a
source
book
on
international
law
in
this
area.
and
this
court
then
adopted
the
statement
in
the
pacific
railroad
case,
page
238
of
volume
120
as
its
own
test
of
constitutional
taking.
it
remains
the
government's
contention
today
that
the
temporary
occupancy
of
premises
under
the
immediate
compulsion
of
a
public
emergency
and
for
the
purpose
of
dealing
with
that
emergency
is
not
a
constitutional
taking
for
which
compensation
is
required.
now,
i
think
counsel
has
fairly
stated
most
of
the
relevant
fact
that
there
are
a
few
additional
things
which
i'd
like
to
emphasize.
first,
it's
quite
clear
from
the
record,
these
riots
started
well
before
the
troops
arrived,
two
or
three
hours
earlier.
the
troops
arrived
down
in
this
area
and
at
the
time
they
arrive,
there
were
rioters
throughout
this
general
area.
there
were
no
rioters
down
here.
when
the
troops
came,
they
found
the
rioters
at
the
buildings
in
which
petitioners
are
now
claiming
compensation.
then,
when
the
sniper
firing
started,
and
it
wasn't
only
sniper
firing,
the
court
of
claims
is
quite
clear,
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
molotov
cocktails
were
being
thrown
while
the
troops
were
on
the
streets.
the
army
fell
back
from
its
positions
and
it
did
not
do
so
only
along
bolivar
avenue
into
these
two
buildings.
it
was
forced
to
fall
back
into
the
commissary
building,
it
was
forced
to
fall
back
here
where
you
can
see
there
are
not
many
buildings.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
excuse
me.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
was
forced
to
fall
back
here
where
you
can
see
there
are
not
many
buildings
in
general
along
the
boundary,
behind
the
railroad
tracks
and
there
are
photographs
in
the
exhibits
of
record
in
court,
not
reproduced
in
the
joint
appendix
which
show
the
bunker
positions
built
with
sandbags
behind
this
railroad
track.
that
left
the
troops
behind
the
sanitation
building,
here.
there
were
no
troops
in
the
sanitation
building.
that
did
not
stop
the
rioters
from
burning
the
sanitation
building.
during
the
course
of
the
riot,
the
sanitation
building
was
completely
destroyed.
so,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
indicates
the
negative
of
petitioner's
theory
that
there
would
have
been
no
burnings
had
the
troops
not
been
in
their
building.
and
it
certainly
also
indicates
the
negative
of
the
theory
that
it
was
to
these
two
buildings
particularly
that
the
presence
of
the
troops
drew
the
rioters
attack.
the
rioters
were
all
along
the
boundary
line,
although
from
the
start,
they
were
concentrated
principally
in
what
we've
called
a
salient
and
they
didn't
favor
any
buildings
particularly
with
their
attack.
they've
made
their
attack
throughout.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
we
have
a
much
different
case
justice
fortas.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
it
would
be
and
i
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it's
not
clear,
the
extent
to
which
it
would.
i
may
say
that
the
damage
issue,
how
much
ought
to
be
paid
if
there
was
a
taking
in
this
case
is
not
settled
on
this
record
and
that
there
will
be
--
would
be
required
to
the
further
proceedings
to
settle
that
question.
we
do
concede
that
the
rioters
did
the
amount
of
damage
that
petitioners
claim
they
did.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
but
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
government
would
be
liable
and
if
the
court
concludes
that
there's
a
taking
in
this
case,
of
course
the
government
would
be
liable
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
alright,
i
agree.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
i
may
say
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
seems
to
me
there
would
be
a
difficult
factual
question,
but
one
which
might
possibly
be
resolved
as
to
what
damage
would
have
occurred
had
the
troops
not
been
there.
and
that
if
it
could
be
determined
that
some
damage
would
have
occurred
had
the
troops
not
been
there,
that
damage
could
be
subtracted,
but
otherwise,
i
would
agree
with
the
preposition
that
the
government
would
be
liable.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
if
i
may
explain
the
basis
on
which
i
do
that
it
seems
to
me
you
have
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
what
i'm
saying
and
i'm
saying
it
because
it
seems
to
me
you
have
your
finger
on
the
distinction
which
is
crucial
to
the
so-called
target
doctrine
in
which
petitioners
may
rely.
under
that
doctrine
as
petitioners
have
already
argued,
if
the
government
makes
a
target
of
a
particular
building
by
turning
it
into
a
fortification,
then
in
principles
of
international
law
at
least
although
it
has
not
been
held
in
the
domestic
context.
the
government
is
liable
for
the
damages
done,
but
it
is
quite
clear
that
in
this
case,
no
such
target
was
made.
for
as
professor
bouchard
points
out
in
the
work
the
petitioners
cite,
the
state
is
responsible
for
the
use
and
occupation
of
buildings
and
real
property
only
if
they're
being
used
in
more
than
a
temporary
way
and
the
use
is
not
impelled
by
military
necessity,
thus
he
says
and
i
quote
“the
target
doctrine
extends
only
to
property
occupied
in
advance
of
actual
fighting
rather
than
such
as
is
occupied
during
an
attack
or
retreat.”
so
that
even
conceding
as
i
have
the
answer
to
your
question,
the
established
principles
applicable
in
this
case
require
that
no
compensation
be
paid.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
there
was
any
previous
use
of
these
buildings.
there
were
riots
in
the
canal
zone
in
1959
booked
into
them
and
so
far
as
i
can
determine,
there
was
no
use
made
of
these
buildings
at
that
time.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
principal
task
i
have
to
carry
out
here
is
to
make
a
case
for
what
we
have
called
the
public
emergency
exception
for
what
president
grant
referred
to
as
the
exception
for
temporary
use
during
and
under
the
compulsion
of
war.
and
to
do
that,
i
have
to
start
at
some
distance
from
ordinary
fifth
amendment
concept.
in
particular,
i
want
to
look
at
the
body
of
law
which
would
ordinarily
govern
the
riot
situation,
that
is
to
say
municipal
liability
for
tort.
if
a
person's
property
were
destroyed
because
the
police
failed
to
protect
it
at
all
or
withdrew
from
the
area
when
the
rioters
seemed
to
be
getting
the
upper
hand,
he
might
file
a
claim
on
the
theory
that
the
police
hadn't
given
him
adequate
protection
or
he
might
make
the
same
claim
if
he
thought
that
because
police
use
teargas
or
billy
clubs
instead
or
riffles
or
machineguns
on
looters,
looting
went
unchecked.
and
indeed,
there
are
many
such
claims
which
have
been
filed
in
new
york
and
in
other
cities
which
were
the
subject
of
urban
riots.
those
claims
are
tort
claims
and
it's
apparent
that
in
the
absences
of
statutory
liability
for
riot
damage
generally,
those
claims
could
not
succeed.
the
decisions
made
whether
he
used
guns
or
not,
where
is
the
most
effective
place
from
which
to
fight
a
riot,
how
is
the
most
effective
way
to
deal
with
it
are
quite
plainly
discretionary
functions
of
government
for
which
no
government
concedes
tort
or
other
liability.
under
federal
law
for
example
any
such
liability
would
be
foreclosed
under
the
tort
claims
act.
and
the
reasons
for
denying
liability
and
not
--
no
lose
has
occurred,
it's
rather
the
desire
to
avoid
any
interference
with
official
action
but
even
the
prospect
of
litigation
or
liability
might
bring.
it's
to
permit
the
officers
to
concentrate
exclusively
on
the
most
efficient
way
of
dealing
with
the
danger.
the
public
necessity
exception
can
be
viewed
as
an
extension
of
this
discretionary
function
reasoning.
by
excusing
policemen
or
troops
from
eminent
domain
liability
from
entering
buildings
in
the
heat
of
emergency
and
for
emergency
purposes,
it
too
protects
their
decisions
from
unwanted
influence.
had
the
troops
in
this
case
simply
left
the
buildings
to
the
mob
there
would
have
been
no
liability.
had
they
used
weapons
which
kept
them
off
away
from
the
buildings,
there
would
have
been
no
liability.
indeed,
it
is
significant
to
what
the
real
characterization
of
this
case
ought
to
be,
the
petitioners
make
no
claim
for
the
value
of
the
use
of
their
premises
for
what
would
be
the
ordinary
fifth
amendment
measure
of
relief.
they
say
the
troops
had
a
right
to
be
there.
they
seek
only
to
recover
the
damage
done
by
the
rioting
mob
when
the
troops
were
unable
to
control
them
with
the
weapons
their
commander
allowed
them
to
use.
thus,
petitioners
seek
exactly
the
damage
that
new
york
merchants
will
be
unable
to
obtain
and
should
be
unable
to
obtain
because
of
the
discretionary
function
doctrine.
we
believe
it
is
as
important
to
foreclose
the
possibility
of
liability
here.
there
have
been
riots
such
the
harlem
riots
of
1943
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
that
certainly
would
be
the
primary
measure.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
no
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
closest
case
as
this
court
have
--
has
decided
that
--
the
closest
this
court's
cases
come
to
that
question
with
a
lease
hold
cases
that
arouse
out
of
world
ward
ii
such
as
the
general
motors
case.
and
in
those
cases,
the
court
seemed
to
be
saying
that
you
didn't
simply
get
the
amount
of
money
that
was
--
could
be
valued
for
the
time
that
the
government
was
there.
there
was
also
the
inconvenience
to
petitioner
and
that
he
was
entitled
among
other
things
to
get
the
premises
back
in
the
condition
in
which
he
gave
them
to
the
government
and
we
cannot
see
any
particular
reason
for
avoiding
that
liability
except
to
the
extent
we
would
argue
that
the
government
would
not
be
responsible
if
it
had
a
lease
hold
for
the
damage
done
by
an
earthquake.
similarly,
it
might
not
be
responsible
for
the
damage
done
by
rioting
mob
only
to
the
extent
that
the
government
could
be
said
to
have
brought
that
damage
on
to
the
buildings
this
was
the
basis
behind
my
answer
to
justice
fortas,
could
the
government
be
held
liable
for
the
rioting
mobs
then.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no.
no,
no
liability
here
at
all.
i
make
reference
to
the
failure
to
claim
rent
value
only
to
show
that
this
really
isn't
a
fifth
amendment
claim.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
in
everything
but
name
a
tort
claim.
it's
for
tort
damages
and
it
looks
exactly
like
the
claims
that
are
arising
out
of
the
urban
riots
today
except
for
this
particular
characterization
that
petitioners
can
make,
can
argue
because
troops
were
forced
by
the
rioters
back
into
their
buildings
in
order
to
be
able
to
carryout
their
function
of
protecting
the
zone
and
still
stay
alive.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
--
i'm
trying
to
explain
the
war
case
doctrine
in
--
sort
of
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
it
is
in
the
sense
that
i
think
that
the
law
has
always
had.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
they
were
civilian
rioters.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
that
--
it
was
close
enough
to
being
a
war
perhaps
with
the
same
sort
of
situation
as
these
claims
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
they
had
not.
there
have
been
riots
such
as
the
harlem
riots
of
1943
in
the
cambridge,
maryland
riots
of
two
summers
ago
in
which
for
what
they
considered
to
be
good
reasons.
the
police
did
not
go
into
the
riot
zone
but
simply
tried
to
contain
the
riot
in
the
area
where
it
was
occurring
by
protecting
the
fringes.
it
seems
to
us
that
there's
no
apparent
justice
in
giving
the
protected
people
at
the
fringes
of
the
riot
area.
a
better
shot
at
compensation
for
whatever
damage
they
suffered
despite
the
presence
of
police
or
troops
than
those
in
the
riot
zone
who
received
no
protection.
since
urban
violence
and
hostility
to
the
police
go
hand
and
hand,
it's
not
going
to
be
difficult
in
any
future
riots
situation
for
plaintiffs
to
make
the
claim
that
the
presence
of
police
in
their
area
drew
a
rioters
attack.
when
the
government
is
responding
to
the
emergency
situation
in
other
words
as
under
the
discretionary
function
generally,
whether
it's
an
emergency
situation
of
war
or
of
riot,
it
ought
not
to
be
subjected
to
the
pressures
and
distortions
that
a
preferential
rule
of
liability
can
bring.
moreover,
it
should
be
clear
that
petitioners
are
not
the
only
ones
who
suffered
losses
at
the
mobs
hand.
and
when
the
ordinary
fifth
amendment
case,
we
have
a
very
clear
sort
of
question
to
be
resolved
or
real
question,
social
question
to
be
resolved.
you
have
on
the
one
hand
a
piece
of
--
a
man
who
owns
a
piece
of
property
and
that
property
is
taken
from
him.
if
you
have
on
the
other
hand
society
as
a
whole
which
benefits
from
the
taking.
and
the
general
question
is
who
is
going
to
bear
that
loss?
the
riot
situation,
the
war
situation
it
seems
to
us
is
quite
different.
total
property
damage
done
is
immense.
in
the
canal
zone,
it
was
about
10
times
as
great
as
petitioners
claim
here.
lives
are
lost,
many
are
injured.
only
a
few
of
the
citizen's
damage
in
such
a
catastrophe
will
have
troops
or
police
or
fireman
on
their
premises.
if
only
they
are
compensated,
the
other
injured
through
their
taxes
have
to
bear
two
burdens
of
loss,
nor
can
it
be
said
that
what
the
community
has
gained
it
ought
to
pay
for.
few
gain
from
a
riot
or
war
or
a
major
fire.
the
community
should
be
free
to
deal
with
the
losses
it
suffers
as
a
whole
and
not
require
to
give
some
citizens
preferential
treatment.
there
is
an
enormous
difficulty
and
basic
unfairness
in
determining
whether
such
calamity
losses
occur
because
the
government
is
present
and
how
much
of
the
loss
would
otherwise
have
occurred
and
hence
need
not
be
compensated.
the
rule
that
petitioners
seek
might
be
just
as
arbitrary
as
the
laws
present
rule
of
letting
such
losses
lie
where
they
fall.
the
problem
of
distributing
them
is
too
complex
to
be
solved
by
compensating
those
who
receive
the
most
direct
effort
and
protection
by
the
government.
no
case
we
have
discovered
in
this
or
any
other
court
has
required
the
government
to
pay
on
fifth
amendment
grounds
or
any
other
grounds
for
the
damage
of
rioters
or
fires
or
other
instruments
of
catastrophe
during
government
efforts
to
contain
them.
no
case
we
have
discovered
characterizes
government
entry
unto
private
property
under
the
compulsion
of
such
an
emergency
as
it
take,
as
shown
in
our
brief
the
law
and
practice
since
the
founding
of
the
nation
has
been
entirely
to
the
contrary.
even
destruction
which
the
government
itself
deliberately
brings
about
need
not
be
compensated.
indeed,
other
cases
of
such
entry
or
generally
treated
as
tort
matters.
if
for
example,
a
fireman
damages
a
hedge
in
bringing
a
hose
to
fight
a
neighbor's
fire
or
a
policeman
must
breakdown
the
door
in
order
to
arrest
someone
who's
hiding
behind
it,
those
claims
are
not
ordinarily
brought
as
fifth
amendment
claims.
the
claims
are
brought
as
matters
of
tort.
the
fireman
was
negligent
or
the
policeman
had
no
necessity
or
legal
basis
to
make
his
arrest.
and
this
is
no
failure
of
analysis.
it's
entirely
consistent
with
the
law
and
this
court
has
followed
in
determining
whether
or
not
taking
has
occurred.
under
that
approach,
conduct
which
is
basically
tortuous
or
would
be
if
it
occurred
between
private
citizens
is
insufficient
in
itself
to
be
a
taking
in
the
constitutional
sense,
thus
in
the
three
portsmouth
harbor
cases
in
volumes
231,
250
and
260
of
the
report.
the
court
twice
found
the
firing
of
harbor
guns
over
petitioners
land
not
to
have
been
takings.
when
the
third
compliant
was
filed,
the
court
concluded
that
that
showed
sufficient
duration
of
abuse
and
sufficient
intense
of
the
abused
to
show
that
a
servitude
had
been
imposed.
similarly
in
cosby
and
in
griggs
versus
allegheny
county,
this
court
stressed
the
number
of
times
airplanes
were
flown
low
over
petitioner's
houses
in
discussing
the
taking
issue.
in
united
states
versus
dickinson
in
331
u.s.,
the
court
said
that
property
is
taken
in
the
constitutional
sense
when
inroads
are
made
on
an
owner's
use
of
it
to
an
extent
that
as
between
private
parties,
a
servitude
has
been
acquired
either
by
agreement
or
in
the
course
of
time.
there
was
no
agreement
in
this
case
and
if
the
servitude
did
not
already
exist,
the
one
brief
occupancy
of
petitioner's
buildings
was
insufficient
to
impress
one
in
itself.
like
the
result
of
the
first
firings
of
the
guns
over
portsmouth
harbor,
the
first
flights
of
planes
over
mr.
cosby's
chicken
farm.
the
damage
in
this
case
would
be
answerable
only
in
tort
if
it
were
answerable
at
all.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that
i
would
not
think
so
because
this
court
is
being
called
upon
to
decide
a
constitutional
matter
generally
and
no
distinction
occurs
to
me
that
would
respond
to
the
fact
that
it
happened
in
canal
zone.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
is
the
--
it
is
an
unusual
situation,
i'm
not
entirely
sure
i
understand
it
myself.
there
is
the
canal
zone
--
panama
canal
zone
company
and
then
there
is
also
the
canal
zone
government.
the
canal
zone
company
which
is
extensively
a
corporation
but
under
government
charter
and
owned
entirely
by
the
government
is
responsible
for
most
physical
affairs
and
owns
most
of
the
property
in
the
area.
the
canal
zone
government
supplies
what
a
city
government
would
ordinarily
supply,
municipal
protection,
fire
protection,
police
protection.
and
in
addition
there
are
large
army
bases
down
there
such
as
the
one
from
which
this
troops
came.
this
were
not
canal
zone
troops,
this
were
government
troops
the
same
as
government
troops
in
any
other
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
in
the
sense
that
they
weren't
canal
zone
policemen
or
canal
zone
firemen.
they
were
not
employees
of
the
canal
zone.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
there
are
canal
zone
policemen
and
firemen
and
as
in
detroit
they
were
the
first
to
attempt
to
quell
the
disturbance
and
they
failed
to
do
so
and
the
troops
were
then
called
in.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
as
i
recall
the
facts,
lieutenant
governor
of
the
canal
zone
asked
the
military
to
take
over
which
is
perhaps
a
unique
situation
of
the
canal
zone
and
the
military
on
assuming
control
then
brought
in
the
troops
to
help
control
the
riots.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
mitchell
case,
the
russell
case
or
for
the
reasons
i
have
already
discussed.
any
of
the
cases
in
international
law
applying
the
so-called
target
doctrine
require
any
different
conclusion.
this
court
itself
showed
the
way
past
mitchell
and
russell
in
the
pacific
rail
road
case
and
then
caltex.
mitchell,
the
trader
was
forced
to
accompany
the
armies
some
three
hundred
miles
to
the
place
where
his
goods
was
destroyed
--
were
destroyed.
russell
involves
steam
boats
which
the
army
commandeered
to
hold
government
freight
on
the
western
front.
thus
both
of
those
cases
are
like
the
case
which
justice
fortas
put
in
which
under
international
law,
in
which
under
international
law
compensation
would
be
required.
they
were
both
cases
in
which
the
army
took
the
property
involved
in
advance
of
fighting
and
for
its
own
use
whether
for
defensive
purposes
or
from
any
other
and
not
cases
like
this
one.
in
which
the
army
was
forced
into
the
buildings
by
fighting
without
advanced
plan
or
arrangement
to
do
so.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
that
would
be
a
difficult
case.
i
think
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
that
would
be
a
difficult
case.
i
think
it's
the
sort
of
case
where
if
it
occurred
by
itself,
if
it
were
one
incident.
if
that
war
or
that
battle
were
the
only
occasion
on
which
damage
had
occurred.
there
might
be
a
strong
tendency
to
say
that
there
was
liability
in
those
circumstances
but
if
on
the
other
hand
it
was
one
out
of
10,000
operations
in
a
huge
conflict
the
court
might
find
that
his
visit
to
the
site
at
12
o'clock
was
in
itself
the
product
of
an
emergency
that
was
developing
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
and
consequently
compensation
need
not
be
paid.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
as
i
understand
the
rationale
of
the
doctrine.
maybe
i
can
--
i
should
say
that
i'm
perhaps
giving
too
much
credence
to
this
international
cases
involved
in
the
target
doctrine.
maybe
i'm
following
them
too
far,
those
cases
arose
in
a
special
situation
where
you
had
neutrals,
foreigners
living
in
one
country
which
was
at
war
with
insurgents
or
some
other
country.
and
the
troops
of
the
country
in
which
these
neutrals
lived
had
to
fight
a
battle
with
their
opponents
and
chose.
and
the
choosing
is
really
the
important
part
and
chose
the
place
where
the
neutrals
live
as
the
place
to
fight
their
battle
and
the
international
cases
have
held
that
in
those
circumstances
compensation
is
to
be
paid.
now
there
is
a
notion
in
that
that
the
choice
is
an
invidious
one
that
when
the
commander
of
the
government
troops
is
thinking
where
shall
i
fight?
he
may
make
the
decision
i'd
rather
fight
where
it's
not
my
people's
property
being
damaged.
i'd
rather
fight
on
the
land
of
the
imperialist
sugar
company
or
something
of
that
fashion.
and
this
rule
of
compensation
was
fashioned
and
applied
entirely
in
cases
which
might
be
considered
imperialist
cases.
they
involve
latin-american
governments
on
the
one
hand,
resisting
liability
and
european
and
american
governments
on
the
other,
north
american
governments
on
the
other
hand
insisting
upon
liability.
in
such
cases,
and
as
we
cite
in
our
brief
there
a
number
of
other
cases
which
refuse
to
apply
the
doctrine
and
refuse
to
apply
it
because
the
(inaudible)
finds
there
that
the
property
of
natives
was
equally
exposed
to
the
risk
of
harm.
there
wasn't
any
discrimination
in
this
case
in
other
words.
so
that's
a
doctrine
which
arise
not
only
out
of
the
fact
of
choice
but
also
out
of
the
existence
of
discrimination
and
perhaps
i
should
insist
that
the
possibility
of
discrimination
should
be
there
as
well
as
the
factor
of
choice.
but
the
thing
which
distinguishes
the
question
you
put
to
me
justice
black,
from
this
case
is
the
factor
of
choice.
that
at
least
in
that
case
one
could
say
that
the
general
had
visited
the
area
and
looked
it
over
and
said,
“here
we
fight.”
whereas
in
this
case,
there
is
no
such
factor,
the
troops
went
to
where
the
rioters
were.
they
had
no
choice
about
it.
the
rioters
were
there
when
the
troops
arrived.
they
went
to
where
the
rioters
were
and
they
fought
them
there
and
they
stayed
there
no
longer
than
there
were
rioters
in
the
vicinity.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
they
were
driven
into
the
buildings.
they
first
took
up
positions
here
along
the
street
and
then
after
one
soldier
was
killed,
several
were
wounded,
and
sniper
fire
was
going
at
them
and
molotov
cocktails
were
being
thrown
at
them,
they
decided
they
could
no
longer
stand
in
the
street.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
rioters
who
in
the
case,
to
the
ymca
were
already
burning
the
building.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right
but
they
did
not
stay
in
the
building
as
that
time
so
far
as
the
record
shows.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
in
part
it
makes
the
little
job
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
right
down
the
middle
of
the
street.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
in
the
middle
of
the
street.
it's
a
very
free
access,
part
of
the
reason
for
that
it
doesn't
show
on
this
map
is
that
cologne
which
shows
here
as
the
republic
of
panama
is
on
the
peninsula.
this
is
its
only
land
border
here,
so
that
this
--
i
don't
know
if
you
can
see
it,
this
corridor
down
here
is
the
only
access
which
the
citizens
of
cologne
have
to
other
parts
of
panama
that
is
panamanian.
the
map
continues
more
or
less
like
my
hand
with
sea
around
it
on
those
sides
and
then
this
is
the
border
which
you
see
here.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
they
were
trying
to
come
across,
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
they
were
in
the
zone
and
they
repeatedly
tried
to
attack
the
zone,
they
also
attack
although
did
not
succeed
in
burning.
in
fact
the
small
building
down
here,
they
attacked
something
which
you
will
find
referred
to
as
the
old
firehouse
which
is
this
building
here.
they
were
burning
railroad
ties
along
here.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
molotov
cocktails.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
they
would
run
up.
there
was
at
one
point
an
effort
to
push
a
burning
car
across
the
boundary
here.
the
difficulty
was
that
the
tear
gas
that
the
troops
were
using
couldn't
keep
the
troop
--
the
rioters
far
enough
from
the
building
to
keep
them
out
of
the
reach
of
the
molotov
cocktails.
i
think
one
could
put
it
that
way
have
they
been
using
something
with
a
little
longer
reach,
a
30/30.
they
might
have
been
able
to
keep
them
away.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
there
is
one
other
matter
that
i
should
point
out
about
the
facts
as
long
as
counsel
has
mentioned
it,
i
would
just
like
to
stress
it.
the
ymca
and
masonic
temple
are
separate
entities.
they
are
represented
by
one
counsel
but
they
are
otherwise
separate
and
this
business
of
observation
post
and
command
post
applies
only
the
masonic
temple.
troops
were
in
the
ymca
for
only
12-hours
and
there
was
no
indication
that
during
the
12-hours
they
were
there.
there
was
any
command
function
or
similar
function
performed.
now
--
well,
in
conclusion,
i
would
just
like
to
state
again
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
at
the
ymca
they
were
in
the
building
for
only
12-hours
from
midnight
till
about
noon
on
friday.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
they're
both
litigants
here,
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
counsel
says
for
a
week.
i
wasn't
aware
that
it
was
that
long
but
it
was
until
at
least
the
13th.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
there
was
an
observation
post
set
up
in
the
temple
after
the
troops
have
been
driven
into
it
and
as
part
of
their
efforts
to
continue
to
maintain
the
zone
boundaries.
there
had
--
there's
no
indication
that
it
was
set
upped
in
advance.
thank
you.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
petitioners
seek
to
recover
from
the
united
states
in
this
case
the
value,
not
of
the
use
of
their
buildings
but
of
the
damage
which
rioters
inflicted
on
those
buildings
during
the
course
of
general
anti-american
riots
in
the
canal
zone.
the
president,
the
congress
and
this
court
have
unanimously
agreed
on
the
legal
principle
which
ought
to
apply
in
that
situation
and
i
should
like
to
quote
it.
it
is
a
general
principle
of
both
international
and
municipal
law
that
all
properties
held
subject
not
only
to
be
taken
by
the
government
for
public
uses,
in
which
case,
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
the
owner
is
entitled
to
just
compensation.
but
also
subject
to
be
temporarily
occupied,
which
is
this
case
or
even
actually
destroyed,
which
is
perhaps
caltex
is
not
involved
here.
in
times
of
great
public
danger
and
when
the
public
safety
demands
it.
and
in
this
latter
case,
governments
do
not
admit
a
legal
obligation
on
their
part
to
compensate
the
owner.
that
statement
as
the
court
may
recognize
from
the
court
of
claims'
opinion
in
this
case
originated
in
the
veto
message
from
president
grant
to
the
congress.
it
was
then
quoted
with
approval
in
the
lawrence
report,
house
report
134
of
the
43rd
congress,
second
session,
which
is
the
most
thorough
congressional
study
ever
undertaken
of
government
liability
or
damage
claims
and
which
is
acquired
independent
stature
as
a
source
book
on
international
law
in
this
area.
and
this
court
then
adopted
the
statement
in
the
pacific
railroad
case,
page
238
of
volume
120
as
its
own
test
of
constitutional
taking.
it
remains
the
government's
contention
today
that
the
temporary
occupancy
of
premises
under
the
immediate
compulsion
of
a
public
emergency
and
for
the
purpose
of
dealing
with
that
emergency
is
not
a
constitutional
taking
for
which
compensation
is
required.
now,
i
think
counsel
has
fairly
stated
most
of
the
relevant
fact
that
there
are
a
few
additional
things
which
i'd
like
to
emphasize.
first,
it's
quite
clear
from
the
record,
these
riots
started
well
before
the
troops
arrived,
two
or
three
hours
earlier.
the
troops
arrived
down
in
this
area
and
at
the
time
they
arrive,
there
were
rioters
throughout
this
general
area.
there
were
no
rioters
down
here.
when
the
troops
came,
they
found
the
rioters
at
the
buildings
in
which
petitioners
are
now
claiming
compensation.
then,
when
the
sniper
firing
started,
and
it
wasn't
only
sniper
firing,
the
court
of
claims
is
quite
clear,
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
molotov
cocktails
were
being
thrown
while
the
troops
were
on
the
streets.
the
army
fell
back
from
its
positions
and
it
did
not
do
so
only
along
bolivar
avenue
into
these
two
buildings.
it
was
forced
to
fall
back
into
the
commissary
building,
it
was
forced
to
fall
back
here
where
you
can
see
there
are
not
many
buildings.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
excuse
me.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
was
forced
to
fall
back
here
where
you
can
see
there
are
not
many
buildings
in
general
along
the
boundary,
behind
the
railroad
tracks
and
there
are
photographs
in
the
exhibits
of
record
in
court,
not
reproduced
in
the
joint
appendix
which
show
the
bunker
positions
built
with
sandbags
behind
this
railroad
track.
that
left
the
troops
behind
the
sanitation
building,
here.
there
were
no
troops
in
the
sanitation
building.
that
did
not
stop
the
rioters
from
burning
the
sanitation
building.
during
the
course
of
the
riot,
the
sanitation
building
was
completely
destroyed.
so,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
indicates
the
negative
of
petitioner's
theory
that
there
would
have
been
no
burnings
had
the
troops
not
been
in
their
building.
and
it
certainly
also
indicates
the
negative
of
the
theory
that
it
was
to
these
two
buildings
particularly
that
the
presence
of
the
troops
drew
the
rioters
attack.
the
rioters
were
all
along
the
boundary
line,
although
from
the
start,
they
were
concentrated
principally
in
what
we've
called
a
salient
and
they
didn't
favor
any
buildings
particularly
with
their
attack.
they've
made
their
attack
throughout.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
think
we
have
a
much
different
case
justice
fortas.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
it
would
be
and
i
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it's
not
clear,
the
extent
to
which
it
would.
i
may
say
that
the
damage
issue,
how
much
ought
to
be
paid
if
there
was
a
taking
in
this
case
is
not
settled
on
this
record
and
that
there
will
be
--
would
be
required
to
the
further
proceedings
to
settle
that
question.
we
do
concede
that
the
rioters
did
the
amount
of
damage
that
petitioners
claim
they
did.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
but
the
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
government
would
be
liable
and
if
the
court
concludes
that
there's
a
taking
in
this
case,
of
course
the
government
would
be
liable
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
alright,
i
agree.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
if
i
may
say
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
seems
to
me
there
would
be
a
difficult
factual
question,
but
one
which
might
possibly
be
resolved
as
to
what
damage
would
have
occurred
had
the
troops
not
been
there.
and
that
if
it
could
be
determined
that
some
damage
would
have
occurred
had
the
troops
not
been
there,
that
damage
could
be
subtracted,
but
otherwise,
i
would
agree
with
the
preposition
that
the
government
would
be
liable.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
if
i
may
explain
the
basis
on
which
i
do
that
it
seems
to
me
you
have
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
what
i'm
saying
and
i'm
saying
it
because
it
seems
to
me
you
have
your
finger
on
the
distinction
which
is
crucial
to
the
so-called
target
doctrine
in
which
petitioners
may
rely.
under
that
doctrine
as
petitioners
have
already
argued,
if
the
government
makes
a
target
of
a
particular
building
by
turning
it
into
a
fortification,
then
in
principles
of
international
law
at
least
although
it
has
not
been
held
in
the
domestic
context.
the
government
is
liable
for
the
damages
done,
but
it
is
quite
clear
that
in
this
case,
no
such
target
was
made.
for
as
professor
bouchard
points
out
in
the
work
the
petitioners
cite,
the
state
is
responsible
for
the
use
and
occupation
of
buildings
and
real
property
only
if
they're
being
used
in
more
than
a
temporary
way
and
the
use
is
not
impelled
by
military
necessity,
thus
he
says
and
i
quote
“the
target
doctrine
extends
only
to
property
occupied
in
advance
of
actual
fighting
rather
than
such
as
is
occupied
during
an
attack
or
retreat.”
so
that
even
conceding
as
i
have
the
answer
to
your
question,
the
established
principles
applicable
in
this
case
require
that
no
compensation
be
paid.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
there
was
any
previous
use
of
these
buildings.
there
were
riots
in
the
canal
zone
in
1959
booked
into
them
and
so
far
as
i
can
determine,
there
was
no
use
made
of
these
buildings
at
that
time.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
principal
task
i
have
to
carry
out
here
is
to
make
a
case
for
what
we
have
called
the
public
emergency
exception
for
what
president
grant
referred
to
as
the
exception
for
temporary
use
during
and
under
the
compulsion
of
war.
and
to
do
that,
i
have
to
start
at
some
distance
from
ordinary
fifth
amendment
concept.
in
particular,
i
want
to
look
at
the
body
of
law
which
would
ordinarily
govern
the
riot
situation,
that
is
to
say
municipal
liability
for
tort.
if
a
person's
property
were
destroyed
because
the
police
failed
to
protect
it
at
all
or
withdrew
from
the
area
when
the
rioters
seemed
to
be
getting
the
upper
hand,
he
might
file
a
claim
on
the
theory
that
the
police
hadn't
given
him
adequate
protection
or
he
might
make
the
same
claim
if
he
thought
that
because
police
use
teargas
or
billy
clubs
instead
or
riffles
or
machineguns
on
looters,
looting
went
unchecked.
and
indeed,
there
are
many
such
claims
which
have
been
filed
in
new
york
and
in
other
cities
which
were
the
subject
of
urban
riots.
those
claims
are
tort
claims
and
it's
apparent
that
in
the
absences
of
statutory
liability
for
riot
damage
generally,
those
claims
could
not
succeed.
the
decisions
made
whether
he
used
guns
or
not,
where
is
the
most
effective
place
from
which
to
fight
a
riot,
how
is
the
most
effective
way
to
deal
with
it
are
quite
plainly
discretionary
functions
of
government
for
which
no
government
concedes
tort
or
other
liability.
under
federal
law
for
example
any
such
liability
would
be
foreclosed
under
the
tort
claims
act.
and
the
reasons
for
denying
liability
and
not
--
no
lose
has
occurred,
it's
rather
the
desire
to
avoid
any
interference
with
official
action
but
even
the
prospect
of
litigation
or
liability
might
bring.
it's
to
permit
the
officers
to
concentrate
exclusively
on
the
most
efficient
way
of
dealing
with
the
danger.
the
public
necessity
exception
can
be
viewed
as
an
extension
of
this
discretionary
function
reasoning.
by
excusing
policemen
or
troops
from
eminent
domain
liability
from
entering
buildings
in
the
heat
of
emergency
and
for
emergency
purposes,
it
too
protects
their
decisions
from
unwanted
influence.
had
the
troops
in
this
case
simply
left
the
buildings
to
the
mob
there
would
have
been
no
liability.
had
they
used
weapons
which
kept
them
off
away
from
the
buildings,
there
would
have
been
no
liability.
indeed,
it
is
significant
to
what
the
real
characterization
of
this
case
ought
to
be,
the
petitioners
make
no
claim
for
the
value
of
the
use
of
their
premises
for
what
would
be
the
ordinary
fifth
amendment
measure
of
relief.
they
say
the
troops
had
a
right
to
be
there.
they
seek
only
to
recover
the
damage
done
by
the
rioting
mob
when
the
troops
were
unable
to
control
them
with
the
weapons
their
commander
allowed
them
to
use.
thus,
petitioners
seek
exactly
the
damage
that
new
york
merchants
will
be
unable
to
obtain
and
should
be
unable
to
obtain
because
of
the
discretionary
function
doctrine.
we
believe
it
is
as
important
to
foreclose
the
possibility
of
liability
here.
there
have
been
riots
such
the
harlem
riots
of
1943
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
that
certainly
would
be
the
primary
measure.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
no
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
the
closest
case
as
this
court
have
--
has
decided
that
--
the
closest
this
court's
cases
come
to
that
question
with
a
lease
hold
cases
that
arouse
out
of
world
ward
ii
such
as
the
general
motors
case.
and
in
those
cases,
the
court
seemed
to
be
saying
that
you
didn't
simply
get
the
amount
of
money
that
was
--
could
be
valued
for
the
time
that
the
government
was
there.
there
was
also
the
inconvenience
to
petitioner
and
that
he
was
entitled
among
other
things
to
get
the
premises
back
in
the
condition
in
which
he
gave
them
to
the
government
and
we
cannot
see
any
particular
reason
for
avoiding
that
liability
except
to
the
extent
we
would
argue
that
the
government
would
not
be
responsible
if
it
had
a
lease
hold
for
the
damage
done
by
an
earthquake.
similarly,
it
might
not
be
responsible
for
the
damage
done
by
rioting
mob
only
to
the
extent
that
the
government
could
be
said
to
have
brought
that
damage
on
to
the
buildings
this
was
the
basis
behind
my
answer
to
justice
fortas,
could
the
government
be
held
liable
for
the
rioting
mobs
then.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no.
no,
no
liability
here
at
all.
i
make
reference
to
the
failure
to
claim
rent
value
only
to
show
that
this
really
isn't
a
fifth
amendment
claim.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
in
everything
but
name
a
tort
claim.
it's
for
tort
damages
and
it
looks
exactly
like
the
claims
that
are
arising
out
of
the
urban
riots
today
except
for
this
particular
characterization
that
petitioners
can
make,
can
argue
because
troops
were
forced
by
the
rioters
back
into
their
buildings
in
order
to
be
able
to
carryout
their
function
of
protecting
the
zone
and
still
stay
alive.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
i
--
i'm
trying
to
explain
the
war
case
doctrine
in
--
sort
of
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
it
is
in
the
sense
that
i
think
that
the
law
has
always
had.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
they
were
civilian
rioters.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
that
--
it
was
close
enough
to
being
a
war
perhaps
with
the
same
sort
of
situation
as
these
claims
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
they
had
not.
there
have
been
riots
such
as
the
harlem
riots
of
1943
in
the
cambridge,
maryland
riots
of
two
summers
ago
in
which
for
what
they
considered
to
be
good
reasons.
the
police
did
not
go
into
the
riot
zone
but
simply
tried
to
contain
the
riot
in
the
area
where
it
was
occurring
by
protecting
the
fringes.
it
seems
to
us
that
there's
no
apparent
justice
in
giving
the
protected
people
at
the
fringes
of
the
riot
area.
a
better
shot
at
compensation
for
whatever
damage
they
suffered
despite
the
presence
of
police
or
troops
than
those
in
the
riot
zone
who
received
no
protection.
since
urban
violence
and
hostility
to
the
police
go
hand
and
hand,
it's
not
going
to
be
difficult
in
any
future
riots
situation
for
plaintiffs
to
make
the
claim
that
the
presence
of
police
in
their
area
drew
a
rioters
attack.
when
the
government
is
responding
to
the
emergency
situation
in
other
words
as
under
the
discretionary
function
generally,
whether
it's
an
emergency
situation
of
war
or
of
riot,
it
ought
not
to
be
subjected
to
the
pressures
and
distortions
that
a
preferential
rule
of
liability
can
bring.
moreover,
it
should
be
clear
that
petitioners
are
not
the
only
ones
who
suffered
losses
at
the
mobs
hand.
and
when
the
ordinary
fifth
amendment
case,
we
have
a
very
clear
sort
of
question
to
be
resolved
or
real
question,
social
question
to
be
resolved.
you
have
on
the
one
hand
a
piece
of
--
a
man
who
owns
a
piece
of
property
and
that
property
is
taken
from
him.
if
you
have
on
the
other
hand
society
as
a
whole
which
benefits
from
the
taking.
and
the
general
question
is
who
is
going
to
bear
that
loss?
the
riot
situation,
the
war
situation
it
seems
to
us
is
quite
different.
total
property
damage
done
is
immense.
in
the
canal
zone,
it
was
about
10
times
as
great
as
petitioners
claim
here.
lives
are
lost,
many
are
injured.
only
a
few
of
the
citizen's
damage
in
such
a
catastrophe
will
have
troops
or
police
or
fireman
on
their
premises.
if
only
they
are
compensated,
the
other
injured
through
their
taxes
have
to
bear
two
burdens
of
loss,
nor
can
it
be
said
that
what
the
community
has
gained
it
ought
to
pay
for.
few
gain
from
a
riot
or
war
or
a
major
fire.
the
community
should
be
free
to
deal
with
the
losses
it
suffers
as
a
whole
and
not
require
to
give
some
citizens
preferential
treatment.
there
is
an
enormous
difficulty
and
basic
unfairness
in
determining
whether
such
calamity
losses
occur
because
the
government
is
present
and
how
much
of
the
loss
would
otherwise
have
occurred
and
hence
need
not
be
compensated.
the
rule
that
petitioners
seek
might
be
just
as
arbitrary
as
the
laws
present
rule
of
letting
such
losses
lie
where
they
fall.
the
problem
of
distributing
them
is
too
complex
to
be
solved
by
compensating
those
who
receive
the
most
direct
effort
and
protection
by
the
government.
no
case
we
have
discovered
in
this
or
any
other
court
has
required
the
government
to
pay
on
fifth
amendment
grounds
or
any
other
grounds
for
the
damage
of
rioters
or
fires
or
other
instruments
of
catastrophe
during
government
efforts
to
contain
them.
no
case
we
have
discovered
characterizes
government
entry
unto
private
property
under
the
compulsion
of
such
an
emergency
as
it
take,
as
shown
in
our
brief
the
law
and
practice
since
the
founding
of
the
nation
has
been
entirely
to
the
contrary.
even
destruction
which
the
government
itself
deliberately
brings
about
need
not
be
compensated.
indeed,
other
cases
of
such
entry
or
generally
treated
as
tort
matters.
if
for
example,
a
fireman
damages
a
hedge
in
bringing
a
hose
to
fight
a
neighbor's
fire
or
a
policeman
must
breakdown
the
door
in
order
to
arrest
someone
who's
hiding
behind
it,
those
claims
are
not
ordinarily
brought
as
fifth
amendment
claims.
the
claims
are
brought
as
matters
of
tort.
the
fireman
was
negligent
or
the
policeman
had
no
necessity
or
legal
basis
to
make
his
arrest.
and
this
is
no
failure
of
analysis.
it's
entirely
consistent
with
the
law
and
this
court
has
followed
in
determining
whether
or
not
taking
has
occurred.
under
that
approach,
conduct
which
is
basically
tortuous
or
would
be
if
it
occurred
between
private
citizens
is
insufficient
in
itself
to
be
a
taking
in
the
constitutional
sense,
thus
in
the
three
portsmouth
harbor
cases
in
volumes
231,
250
and
260
of
the
report.
the
court
twice
found
the
firing
of
harbor
guns
over
petitioners
land
not
to
have
been
takings.
when
the
third
compliant
was
filed,
the
court
concluded
that
that
showed
sufficient
duration
of
abuse
and
sufficient
intense
of
the
abused
to
show
that
a
servitude
had
been
imposed.
similarly
in
cosby
and
in
griggs
versus
allegheny
county,
this
court
stressed
the
number
of
times
airplanes
were
flown
low
over
petitioner's
houses
in
discussing
the
taking
issue.
in
united
states
versus
dickinson
in
331
u.s.,
the
court
said
that
property
is
taken
in
the
constitutional
sense
when
inroads
are
made
on
an
owner's
use
of
it
to
an
extent
that
as
between
private
parties,
a
servitude
has
been
acquired
either
by
agreement
or
in
the
course
of
time.
there
was
no
agreement
in
this
case
and
if
the
servitude
did
not
already
exist,
the
one
brief
occupancy
of
petitioner's
buildings
was
insufficient
to
impress
one
in
itself.
like
the
result
of
the
first
firings
of
the
guns
over
portsmouth
harbor,
the
first
flights
of
planes
over
mr.
cosby's
chicken
farm.
the
damage
in
this
case
would
be
answerable
only
in
tort
if
it
were
answerable
at
all.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that
i
would
not
think
so
because
this
court
is
being
called
upon
to
decide
a
constitutional
matter
generally
and
no
distinction
occurs
to
me
that
would
respond
to
the
fact
that
it
happened
in
canal
zone.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
it
is
the
--
it
is
an
unusual
situation,
i'm
not
entirely
sure
i
understand
it
myself.
there
is
the
canal
zone
--
panama
canal
zone
company
and
then
there
is
also
the
canal
zone
government.
the
canal
zone
company
which
is
extensively
a
corporation
but
under
government
charter
and
owned
entirely
by
the
government
is
responsible
for
most
physical
affairs
and
owns
most
of
the
property
in
the
area.
the
canal
zone
government
supplies
what
a
city
government
would
ordinarily
supply,
municipal
protection,
fire
protection,
police
protection.
and
in
addition
there
are
large
army
bases
down
there
such
as
the
one
from
which
this
troops
came.
this
were
not
canal
zone
troops,
this
were
government
troops
the
same
as
government
troops
in
any
other
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
in
the
sense
that
they
weren't
canal
zone
policemen
or
canal
zone
firemen.
they
were
not
employees
of
the
canal
zone.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
there
are
canal
zone
policemen
and
firemen
and
as
in
detroit
they
were
the
first
to
attempt
to
quell
the
disturbance
and
they
failed
to
do
so
and
the
troops
were
then
called
in.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
as
i
recall
the
facts,
lieutenant
governor
of
the
canal
zone
asked
the
military
to
take
over
which
is
perhaps
a
unique
situation
of
the
canal
zone
and
the
military
on
assuming
control
then
brought
in
the
troops
to
help
control
the
riots.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
mitchell
case,
the
russell
case
or
for
the
reasons
i
have
already
discussed.
any
of
the
cases
in
international
law
applying
the
so-called
target
doctrine
require
any
different
conclusion.
this
court
itself
showed
the
way
past
mitchell
and
russell
in
the
pacific
rail
road
case
and
then
caltex.
mitchell,
the
trader
was
forced
to
accompany
the
armies
some
three
hundred
miles
to
the
place
where
his
goods
was
destroyed
--
were
destroyed.
russell
involves
steam
boats
which
the
army
commandeered
to
hold
government
freight
on
the
western
front.
thus
both
of
those
cases
are
like
the
case
which
justice
fortas
put
in
which
under
international
law,
in
which
under
international
law
compensation
would
be
required.
they
were
both
cases
in
which
the
army
took
the
property
involved
in
advance
of
fighting
and
for
its
own
use
whether
for
defensive
purposes
or
from
any
other
and
not
cases
like
this
one.
in
which
the
army
was
forced
into
the
buildings
by
fighting
without
advanced
plan
or
arrangement
to
do
so.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
that
would
be
a
difficult
case.
i
think
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
i
think
that
would
be
a
difficult
case.
i
think
it's
the
sort
of
case
where
if
it
occurred
by
itself,
if
it
were
one
incident.
if
that
war
or
that
battle
were
the
only
occasion
on
which
damage
had
occurred.
there
might
be
a
strong
tendency
to
say
that
there
was
liability
in
those
circumstances
but
if
on
the
other
hand
it
was
one
out
of
10,000
operations
in
a
huge
conflict
the
court
might
find
that
his
visit
to
the
site
at
12
o'clock
was
in
itself
the
product
of
an
emergency
that
was
developing
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
and
consequently
compensation
need
not
be
paid.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
as
i
understand
the
rationale
of
the
doctrine.
maybe
i
can
--
i
should
say
that
i'm
perhaps
giving
too
much
credence
to
this
international
cases
involved
in
the
target
doctrine.
maybe
i'm
following
them
too
far,
those
cases
arose
in
a
special
situation
where
you
had
neutrals,
foreigners
living
in
one
country
which
was
at
war
with
insurgents
or
some
other
country.
and
the
troops
of
the
country
in
which
these
neutrals
lived
had
to
fight
a
battle
with
their
opponents
and
chose.
and
the
choosing
is
really
the
important
part
and
chose
the
place
where
the
neutrals
live
as
the
place
to
fight
their
battle
and
the
international
cases
have
held
that
in
those
circumstances
compensation
is
to
be
paid.
now
there
is
a
notion
in
that
that
the
choice
is
an
invidious
one
that
when
the
commander
of
the
government
troops
is
thinking
where
shall
i
fight?
he
may
make
the
decision
i'd
rather
fight
where
it's
not
my
people's
property
being
damaged.
i'd
rather
fight
on
the
land
of
the
imperialist
sugar
company
or
something
of
that
fashion.
and
this
rule
of
compensation
was
fashioned
and
applied
entirely
in
cases
which
might
be
considered
imperialist
cases.
they
involve
latin-american
governments
on
the
one
hand,
resisting
liability
and
european
and
american
governments
on
the
other,
north
american
governments
on
the
other
hand
insisting
upon
liability.
in
such
cases,
and
as
we
cite
in
our
brief
there
a
number
of
other
cases
which
refuse
to
apply
the
doctrine
and
refuse
to
apply
it
because
the
(inaudible)
finds
there
that
the
property
of
natives
was
equally
exposed
to
the
risk
of
harm.
there
wasn't
any
discrimination
in
this
case
in
other
words.
so
that's
a
doctrine
which
arise
not
only
out
of
the
fact
of
choice
but
also
out
of
the
existence
of
discrimination
and
perhaps
i
should
insist
that
the
possibility
of
discrimination
should
be
there
as
well
as
the
factor
of
choice.
but
the
thing
which
distinguishes
the
question
you
put
to
me
justice
black,
from
this
case
is
the
factor
of
choice.
that
at
least
in
that
case
one
could
say
that
the
general
had
visited
the
area
and
looked
it
over
and
said,
“here
we
fight.”
whereas
in
this
case,
there
is
no
such
factor,
the
troops
went
to
where
the
rioters
were.
they
had
no
choice
about
it.
the
rioters
were
there
when
the
troops
arrived.
they
went
to
where
the
rioters
were
and
they
fought
them
there
and
they
stayed
there
no
longer
than
there
were
rioters
in
the
vicinity.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
they
were
driven
into
the
buildings.
they
first
took
up
positions
here
along
the
street
and
then
after
one
soldier
was
killed,
several
were
wounded,
and
sniper
fire
was
going
at
them
and
molotov
cocktails
were
being
thrown
at
them,
they
decided
they
could
no
longer
stand
in
the
street.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
rioters
who
in
the
case,
to
the
ymca
were
already
burning
the
building.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right
but
they
did
not
stay
in
the
building
as
that
time
so
far
as
the
record
shows.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
in
part
it
makes
the
little
job
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
right
down
the
middle
of
the
street.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
in
the
middle
of
the
street.
it's
a
very
free
access,
part
of
the
reason
for
that
it
doesn't
show
on
this
map
is
that
cologne
which
shows
here
as
the
republic
of
panama
is
on
the
peninsula.
this
is
its
only
land
border
here,
so
that
this
--
i
don't
know
if
you
can
see
it,
this
corridor
down
here
is
the
only
access
which
the
citizens
of
cologne
have
to
other
parts
of
panama
that
is
panamanian.
the
map
continues
more
or
less
like
my
hand
with
sea
around
it
on
those
sides
and
then
this
is
the
border
which
you
see
here.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
they
were
trying
to
come
across,
yes.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
they
were
in
the
zone
and
they
repeatedly
tried
to
attack
the
zone,
they
also
attack
although
did
not
succeed
in
burning.
in
fact
the
small
building
down
here,
they
attacked
something
which
you
will
find
referred
to
as
the
old
firehouse
which
is
this
building
here.
they
were
burning
railroad
ties
along
here.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
molotov
cocktails.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
well,
they
would
run
up.
there
was
at
one
point
an
effort
to
push
a
burning
car
across
the
boundary
here.
the
difficulty
was
that
the
tear
gas
that
the
troops
were
using
couldn't
keep
the
troop
--
the
rioters
far
enough
from
the
building
to
keep
them
out
of
the
reach
of
the
molotov
cocktails.
i
think
one
could
put
it
that
way
have
they
been
using
something
with
a
little
longer
reach,
a
30/30.
they
might
have
been
able
to
keep
them
away.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
no,
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
there
is
one
other
matter
that
i
should
point
out
about
the
facts
as
long
as
counsel
has
mentioned
it,
i
would
just
like
to
stress
it.
the
ymca
and
masonic
temple
are
separate
entities.
they
are
represented
by
one
counsel
but
they
are
otherwise
separate
and
this
business
of
observation
post
and
command
post
applies
only
the
masonic
temple.
troops
were
in
the
ymca
for
only
12-hours
and
there
was
no
indication
that
during
the
12-hours
they
were
there.
there
was
any
command
function
or
similar
function
performed.
now
--
well,
in
conclusion,
i
would
just
like
to
state
again
--
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
at
the
ymca
they
were
in
the
building
for
only
12-hours
from
midnight
till
about
noon
on
friday.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
they're
both
litigants
here,
that's
right.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
counsel
says
for
a
week.
i
wasn't
aware
that
it
was
that
long
but
it
was
until
at
least
the
13th.
mr.
peter
l.
strauss
there
was
an
observation
post
set
up
in
the
temple
after
the
troops
have
been
driven
into
it
and
as
part
of
their
efforts
to
continue
to
maintain
the
zone
boundaries.
there
had
--
there's
no
indication
that
it
was
set
upped
in
advance.
thank
you.
