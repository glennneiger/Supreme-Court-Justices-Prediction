justice
thurgood
marshall
but
mr.
jacks,
do
i
understand
that
the
army
went
there
to
protect
these
two
buildings.
justice
thurgood
marshall
including
those
two
buildings?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
use
of
that
building
was
for
the
same
purpose?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
they
had
withdrawn
the
troops
around
--
from
around
that
building,
back
down
that
street,
what
would
happen
to
those
two
buildings?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
wouldn't
--
wouldn't
they
had
been
destroyed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
--
either
the
masonic
temple
or
the
ymca
have
troops?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.

thurgood
marshall
both
troops?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,

justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
obviously
they
didn't.
they
needed
the
army
to
protect
those
buildings
or
they
wouldn't
be
protected.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
they
had
stayed
outside
of
the
building
to
protect
the
building,
you
have
no
claim.
but
if
they
go
inside
of
the
building
for
the
same
purpose
of
protecting
it,
you
do
have
a
claim.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
help.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
did
these
troops
get
in
that
position
where
they
needed
protection?
they
got
in
that
position
because
they
were
there
to
protect
the
building,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
correct
that
they
went
into
the
buildings
and
threw
the
molotov
cocktail
people
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
what
--
the
fire
is
in
the
building?
justice
thurgood
marshall
by
the
first
cocktail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
there
were
fires
there.
the
troops
didn't
start
the
fire,
somebody
else
started
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
can
there
be
any
question
that
the
major
part
of
their
job
as
witness
of
fact
that
they
were
lined
up
in
front
of
the
ymca
building,
was
it
they
were
there
to
protect
the
building?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
would
you
suggest
that
in
the
future
that
a
situation
like
that,
the
army
just
let
the
building
burn
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
difference
between
going
and
seizing
a
building
and
being
driven
into
a
building?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they
seized
so
as
it
disputed
the
facts.
one
soldier
was
killed
right
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right
there
and
others

wounded.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and

seizing
that
building,
am
i?
am
i?
i
mean,
speaking
only
myself;
i'm
not
speaking
about
all
of
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood

blown
up?
