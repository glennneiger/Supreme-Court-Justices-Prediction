justice
abe
fortas
what
is
your
--
is
your
question
here
or
at
least
one
of
the
questions
here
whether
this
indeed
constituted
a
seizure
by
the
government
followed
by
the
damage
or
whether
it
was
--
this
was
the
damage
incurred
in
the
course
of
a
military
or
quasi
military
operation?
justice
abe
fortas
let's
see
if
i
could
get
it
this
way.
let's
suppose
that
the
united
states
troops
had
been
drawn
up
in
the
street
outside
of
these
two
buildings,
that
the
mob
then
attacked
throwing
molotov
cocktails
and
doing
whatever
they
did.
the
troops
then
retired
into
these
two
buildings.
the
conflict
continued,
damage
resulted
to
the
buildings.
would
you
still
contend
that
the
united
states
must
pay
you
for
the
damage
done?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
though
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
now,
tell
me
why.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
question
--
there
you're
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
well,
they
don't
say
it.
justice
abe
fortas
they
never
say
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
once
the
army
retired
into
those
buildings
as
part
of
its
protective
operation.
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
you're
--
what
you're
saying
then
amounts
to
the
proposition
that
in
any
riot
situation,
any
building
to
which
is
physically
occupied
--
which
is
physically
occupied
by
the
military
forces
of
the
united
states,
problems
within
this
category
that
is
to
say
that
the
united
states
is
liable
for
the
damage
inflicted
upon
that
building
by
the
attacking
mob.
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
that
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
--
now
that
--
this
to
me
is
a
critical
area.
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
do
you
--
do
you
think
it
constitutes
a
compensable
taking
in
a
riot
situation
in
which
you
don't.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
these
are
not
simple
standards.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
let
me
just
put
this
to
you
very
simply,
i'm
--
because
we're
not
engaged
in
what
is
entirely
an
academic
exchange
of
verbal
dialogue
here.
let's
take
one
of
these
riot
situations
that
the
country
witnessed,
what
--
some
for
--
last
or
so.
and
let
us
suppose
that
the
united
states
troops
are
there.
and
they
are
in
the
street
and
the
mob
is
throwing
molotov
cocktails
and
stones
and
shooting
and
doing
whatever
they
did.
and
let
us
then
suppose
that
the
troops
retire
into
or
take
refuge
in
or
go
into,
go
into
let,
us
say,
a
building
and
from
that
building
they
take
defense,
they
observe
the
mob
and
they
take
defensive
action
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
shooting
guns
at
the
--
in
those
circumstances.
now,
in
your
submission
to
the
court,
is
that
a
compensable
taking
and
if
it
is
not
a
compensable
taking,
what
are
the
elements
which
distinguish
that
case
from
your
case.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
can't
--
if
we
should
disagree
with
you
on
the
case
that
i
have
put
to
you
then
we
would
have
to
disagree
with
you
on
the
case
submitted
to
us
for
adjudication.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
may
be
wrong
on
this
but
by
recollection
of
reading
the
documents
here
is
that
the
damage
to
the
masonic
building
occurred
after
the
troops
had
retired
into
that,
after
the
ymca
building
was
set
on
fire.
justice
abe
fortas
why
don't
you
make
the
claim
for
that
part
of
the
damage
inflicted
in
the
--
those
initial
phases
of
the
operation
that
was
inflicted
by
the
army,
let
us
say
by
the
exchange
of
civilities
between
the
army
and
the
mob?
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
and
then
i'll
leave
you
alone.
do
i
understand
from
your
last
statement
then
that
if
the
rioters
had
been
in
the
building
and
the
army
had
moved
in
troops
to
oust
them
and
the
army
had
inflicted
damage
on
the
building
in
the
course
of
that
operation
by
shooting
the
glass
and
the
television,
western
movie
accuracy
for
example,
that
the
army
--
in
your
submission,
the
army
would
have
been
liable
for
the
resulting
damage.
justice
abe
fortas
then
your
submission,
it
would
not?
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
i
suppose
the
army
a
month
in
advance
of
this
trouble
had
said,
“we
foresee
that
there's
going
to
be
trouble
and
we
therefore
occupy
these
two
buildings.”
justice
abe
fortas
do
you
think
it
might
be
--
i
know
it
would
be
different
and
i
appreciate
you're
agreeing
with
me,
but
would
that
be
a
compensable
taking
in
the
constitutional
sense?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
--
that
compense
--
in
the
payment
for
that
would
have
to
cover
the
consequential
damages,
wouldn't
it
or
would
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
suppose
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
if
the
army
a
month
in
advance
had
occupied
these
building
and
the
riots
have
occurred
and
the
rioters
had
destroyed
the
building,
do
you
think
it's
an
open
question
as
to
whether
the
government
would
have
to
pay
the
total
cost
of
the
building
as
distinguished
from
just
compensation
for
use
and
occupancy
without
taking
into
account
the
damage
done
by
the
riots.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no,
no,
that's
not
my
question.
justice
abe
fortas
the
critical
--
no,
wait
a
minute
--
justice
abe
fortas
wait
a
minute,
mr.
strauss.
critical
question
is
whether
the
government
would
be
liable
in
that
situation
or
the
destruction
of
the
building
which
was
brought
about
as
a
result
of
the
conflict
between
the
rioters
and
the
troops.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
but
you
say
you
think
the
government
would
be
liable
for
the
damage
that
occurred
in
the
course
of
the
riot
unless
such
part
of
that
damage
as
could
be
shown
to
be
not
attributable
to
government
occupancy.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
what
you're
saying
is.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
would
happen
if
the
troops
hadn't
gone
in?
justice
abe
fortas
what
would
have
happened
if
the
troops
have
not
rallied
around
or
gone
into
the
ymca?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
what
had
happened
in
this
particular
situation?
justice
abe
fortas
(voice
overlap)
in
the
building,
weren't
there?
justice
abe
fortas
what
i
mean
to
say
that
it
isn't
very
reasonable
to
suppose
that
if
the
army
hadn't
come,
the
rioters
would
have
said,
“we
beg
your
pardon
and
backed
out
of
there.”
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
point,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
your
--
is
your
question
here
or
at
least
one
of
the
questions
here
whether
this
indeed
constituted
a
seizure
by
the
government
followed
by
the
damage
or
whether
it
was
--
this
was
the
damage
incurred
in
the
course
of
a
military
or
quasi
military
operation?
justice
abe
fortas
let's
see
if
i
could
get
it
this
way.

the
troops
then
retired

the
conflict
continued,
damage
resulted
to
the
buildings.
would
you
still
contend
that
the
united
states
must
pay
you
for
the
damage
done?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that
but
though
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
now,
tell
me
why.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
question
--
there
you're
(voice

justice
abe
fortas
well,
they
don't
say
it.
justice
abe
fortas
they
never

but
once
the

retired
into

as

inflicted
upon

isn't
that
(voice

justice

fortas
now,
what
--
now
that

this
to
me
is
a
critical
area.
justice

fortas
and
what
do
you

do
you

it
constitutes
a
compensable

in

in
which
you
don't.
justice

these
