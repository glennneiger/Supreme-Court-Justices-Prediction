mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
we
have
made
arrangements
with
the
petitioner
in
the
solicitor
general's
office
for
the
use
of
a
diagram,
if
we
may
that
the
marshal
is
bringing
in
at
this
moment.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
may
just
in
advance
say
that
this
is
an
action
for
just
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
it
arises
out
of
the
united
states
army's
seizure
and
use
of
private
property,
in
this
case
buildings
belonging
to
the
petitioners
during
the
panamanian
riots
of
1962.
the
issue
before
this
court
as
we
view
it
is
whether
the
court
of
claims
correctly
held
the
that
u.s.
military
forces
may
sieze
and
use
private
property
without
incurring
a
duty
to
provide
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment
whenever
they
are
faced
with
a
“immediate
necessity.”
the
facts
are
as
follows:
if
i
may
briefly
refer
to
them.
this
is
a
chart
that
was
prepared
by
the
united
states
government
for
presentation
to
the
organization
of
american
states
following
the
panamanian
riots
in
the
course
of
a
charge
that
united
states
was
the
aggressor
in
these
riots.
its
accuracy
has
been
stipulated
too.
the
buildings
that
are
here
today
are
the
real
building,
the
real
property
in
question.
this
is
the
masonic

and
this
is
the

to
the

this

on

starting
here
on

moved
down
11th

cleared
the
zone
of
rioters,
move
behind

ymca
and
the
masonic

had
brief
scuffles
with

who
were

in

of
those
buildings,
evicted

out

this
is
approximately
from

to

on

shortly
after

mr.

mr.

is
mr.

both
the
masonic

and
the
ymca
are
the
petitioners
in
this
action.
troops
are
stationed
along
bolivar
avenue
in
11th
street,
they
began
to
receive
sniper
fire
and
at
that
point
the
local
commander
ordered
them
to
withdraw
into
the
ymca,
masonic
temple
and
the
old
commissary.
throughout
the
night,
snipers
continued
to
harass
the
army
troops
inside
the
building.
in
the
morning
of
the
10th,
the
mob
began
to
form
over
here
on
bolivar
avenue
and
directed
a
concentrated
molotov
cocktail
attack
first
at
the
ymca
where
our
company,
a
140
men
of
troops
were
housed.
they
finally
--
about
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
of
the
10th,
succeeded
in
setting
it
on
fire
forcing
the
troops
to
evacuate
at
which
point
they
moved
down
the
street
and
began
to
concentrate
on
the
masonic
temple
in
which
the
army
not
only
had
troops
but
it
established
a
command
post
and
an
observation
post.
there
is
a
photograph
in
the
back
of
the
appendix
which
shows
the
masonic
temple.
it
shows
the
roof
as
being
higher
than
the
other
buildings
in
the
area
and
having
the
shield
that
parapet.
it
was
from
that
position
that
the
army
was
able
to
command
this
entire
area
both
for
observation
and
later
in
attempts
to
quell
the
rioters.
the
mob
was
unable
to
set
the
masonic
temple
on
fire
due
to
a
difference
in
construction
although
they
did
start
some
fires
in
the
interior.
they
there
upon
moved
down
to
the
old
commissary
not
owned
by
the
petitioners,
owned
by
the
government
and
finally
succeeded
in
setting
that
on
fire
with
molotov
cocktails
in
the
next
day.
on
the
basis
of
these
facts,
petitioners
made
claim
first
in
the
part
of
the
army
and
then
with
the
court
of
claims
contending
that
there
was
liability
where
the
army
had
siezed
and
used
petitioner's
buildings
as
sources
of
refuge
in
defense.

mr.

mr.

that
says,
buildings
looted
and
damaged

burnt.
this
is
attached
to
the
appendix
mr.
chief
justice.
the
last
page
of
the
appendix
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
on
the
basis
of
these
facts
the
court
of
claims
held
that
there
was
no
liability
for
the
seizure
and
use
of
these
buildings.
that
is
the
ymca
and
the
masonic
temple,
holding
that
there
was
no
liability
for
occupancy
of
private
property
which
is
immediately
necessary
for
the
safety
of
troops,
or
to
meet
an
emergency
threatening
great
public
danger.
judge
davis
dissented,
judge
davis
said
that
on
his
basis
of
the
applicable
case
law,
he
thought
it
clear
that
the
government
is
liable
where
at
first
takes
the
property
for
it
s
own
military
use
and
then
exposes
the
place
to
enemy
attack
or
revokes
it
leading
to
injury
or
destruction.
in
this
connection,
judge
davis
said
and
we
should
emphasize
this,
there
is
no
exception
from
liability
as
i
read
the
materials
for
temporary
seizures
for
military
use
in
the
face
of
imminent
hostility
or
to
meet
an
emergency.
once
the
property
is
taken
for
a
military
use,
the
government
is
responsible
for
a
subsequent
injury
no
matter
how
quickly
that
follows
upon
seizure.
thus
in
our
view
the
issue
here
between
the
majority
and
the
dissent
below
is
--
centers
on
all
the
important
question
on
whether
an
immediate
necessity
or
imminent
hostility
creates
an
exception
to
the
general
duty
to
provide
compensation.
we
think
it
does
not
and
cannot
that
the
court
of
claims
decision
if
allowed
to
stand
creates
a
grave
and
unwarranted
threat
to
the
citizens
right
of
compensation.
for
if
an
immediate
necessity
is
sufficient
to
confer
absolute
immunity
upon
the
government
whenever
it
seizes
and
uses
private
property
then
we
are
indeed
faced
with
a
new
era
of
governmental
power.
the
basic
issue
is
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
no,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
characterize
the
factual
element
of
the
issue
as
to
whether
there
was
a
seizure
and
a
use
for
a
military
purpose
and
we
take
the
position
as
that
expressed
by
judge
davis
below
that
once
there's
a
seizure
and
use
by
the
u.s.
armed
forces
for
military
purpose,
there's
a
liability
regardless
of
how
the
damage
occurs.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes,
your
honor
although
that's
not
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
but
i
would
contend
that
there
would
be
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
because
in
that
case
your
honor,
the
army
once
it
took
those
buildings.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i'm
using
taking
not
on
the
constitutional
sense
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
all
right.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
once
the
army
seized
those
buildings.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
would
say
there
would
be
liability
because
by
so
doing
under
the
established
case
law,
it
then
makes
--
exposes
those
buildings
to
special
response
on
the
part
of
the
opposing
forces.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
would
say
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
may
i
qualify
that.
i
don't
think
that
i'd
make
quite
that
broad
a
statement,
i
would
say
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
right.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
would
say
the
criteria
would
be
as
follows
mr.
justice
fortas.
first
of
all,
there
must
be
a
necessity
which
justifies
the
seizure.
not
going
to
acquire
their
duty
of
compensations
available
but
whether
there's
authority
to
take
it.
then,
the
use
must
be
actual
and
not
constructive
or
passive.
by
that,
i
mean
the
army
has
to
withdraw
into
the
building,
use
it
as
a
command
post,
the
defense
fortress
and
observation
force
as
opposed
to
merely
standing
in
front
of
the
building
or
passing
through
for
30
seconds.
then,
the
use
of
the
army
thirdly,
gets
out
of
that
building
must
have
some
benefit
to
the
government
as
was
present
in
this
case.
it
can
also
have
a
benefit
to
the
owner
but
it
must
have
a
benefit
to
the
government.
then,
i
should
suggest
fourthly
that
that
benefit
should
relate
to
the
specific
mission
that
the
army
is
involved
in
that
particular
case
as
it
was
here.
and
that
finally,
that
you
should
be
of
sufficient
scope
and
duration.
now,
this
will
depend
upon
the
facts
of
each
case
but
to
make
it
clear
that
it
was
more
than
fleeting
or
merely
consequential.
in
this
case,
the
masonic
temple
was
occupied
for
a
period
of
seven
days.
the
ymca
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
until
the
troops
were
forced
to
evacuate
it.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
no,
your
honor,
and
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
would
say
that
is
a
compensable
taking
mr.
justice
fortas.
and
that
the
elements
are
substantially
somewhere
to
those
involved
here.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
not
necessarily
mr.
justice
fortas
because
i
think
this
is
a
stronger
case.
here,
we're
involved
with
buildings
that
were
held
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
in
which
there
was
a
substantial
number
of
men
involved
to
use
throughout
the
riots
and
we're
here,
we
have
--
although
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
make
out
liability.
here,
we
have
a
fairly
strong
evidence
of
a
causal
connection
between
the
seizure
and
the
result
in
destruction.
the
point
being
that
just
the
buildings
occupied
by
the
troops
is
indicated
by
the
hash
marks
or
the
ones
that
were
substantially
destroyed.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
no,
your
honor.
if
i
may
correct
you
on
the
record,
the
facts
are
that
the
masonic,
there
were
rioters
in
the
masonic
temple,
in
the
ymca
that
were
looting
to
just
some
extent
destroying
the
interior
when
the
army
first
arrived.
they
moved
those
rioters
out
of
the
buildings.
we
don't
make
any
claim
for
that
damage.
the
army
then
took
up
positions
in
the
street.
they
were
subsequently
forced
to
retire
into
both
buildings,
both
buildings
at
once.
that
is
the
masonic
temple
and
the
ymca.
and
the
damage
to
those
structures
by
a
molotov
cocktail
occurred
the
day
and
the
second
day
following
that.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
well,
because
your
honor,
that
damage
to
be
precise
if
i
may
on
the
basis
of
the
record,
the
damage
--
the
initial
damage
is
all
done
by
the
rioters,
a
very
little
--
they
have
got
in
and
they
were
looting
the
interiors
of
the
buildings
and
the
army
moved
them
out.
and
so,
there
is
no
damage
really
done
by
the
army
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
would
not
have
been
liable,
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
it
would
not
because
there's
no
use
made
of
that
building,
your
honor.
that
building
is
really
in
that
case,
a
random
consequence
of
battle
and
that
just
happened
to
be
in
the
way
of
the
exchange
but
the
army
never
seized
and
used
that
building.
either
the
key,
the
pivotal
point
your
honor
is
that
army
has
to
take
and
retire
to
and
use
and
at
that
point
as
judge
davis
said
liability
attaches.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
it
went
there
mr.
justice
marshall
for
the
purposes
of
clearing
the
rioters
from
the
zone
and
protecting
the
zone
in
general.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
including
those
two
buildings,
yes.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
the
use
of
the
building
we
contend
mr.
justice
marshall
was
primarily
to
protect
the
troops.
that's
spelled
out
on
the
record,
which
is
stipulated,
too.
that
was
the
reason
the
army
withdrew
into
the
building,
was
to
protect
the
troops.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
if
they
had
been
destroyed,
there'd
be
no
claim
here,
your
honor,
because
there
had
been
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
wouldn't
--
it's
not
clear,
it's
not
clear.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
did
either
of
them
have
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes,
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
troops
inside
the
buildings.
we
mean
the
privately
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
no.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
it's
not
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
may
i
rephrase
my
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
think
that
they
withdrew
into
the
buildings
to
protect
the
troops
primarily.
if
they
had
not
gone
into
the
buildings
and
the
buildings
have
been
lost,
there
would
be
no
claim.
for
example,
there
were
troop
stationed
all
behind
here,
but
never
in
these
two
buildings
here,
yet
these
buildings
were
never
destroyed.
we
don't
contend
that
it's
necessary
to
show
that
the
mob
moved
just
against
the
buildings
that
the
army
occupied
to
make
out
our
test,
because
once
there
is
seizure
and
use,
there's
liability
but
we
think
that
is
an
important
point.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
then
i
would
not
be
making
the
claim
here
today,
mr.
justice
white.
i
would
contend
although
that's
a
close
question
that
that
falls
within
the
true
battle
damage
situation.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
think
that
could
be
argued
both
way.
if
you
could
show
that
had
put
the
buildings
up
as
a
buffer,
that
they'd
in
effect
deliberately
sacrifice
them
to
protect
the
troops,
then
i
think
we'd
have
caltex
and
we
would
be
prepared
to
argue
as
we
do
in
point
number
two
of
our
brief
that
caltex
should
be
overruled.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
would
not
without
overruling
caltex
i
believe
in
that
case
if
they
used
--
if
they
sacrifice
the
buildings
to
protect
the
troops,
but
we
of
course
we
contend
that's
not
the
effect.
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
i
should
like
to
use
my
remaining
time
in
rebuttal.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
thank
you.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
should
only
like
to
comment,
i
believe
mr.
justice
black
you
asked
how
long
were
the
troops
in
the
ymca.
it
was
until
about
2
o'clock
on
the
afternoon
of
the
10th
for
14
hours
and
they
left
only
because
the
fire
started
by
the
molotov
cocktails
drove
them
out.
they
had
to
abandon
the
building,
they
could
no
longer
inhabit.
i
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
how
the
troops
decided,
you
mean
to
take
over
these
buildings?
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
the
record
is
not
clear
as
to
when
that
choice
occurred
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
apparent
for
--
hence
to
say
that
when
the
troops
in
the
street
in
front
of
these
buildings
began
to
receive
sniper
fire
and
that
it
was
a
prudent
decision
to
withdraw
into
these
buildings,
one.
two,
the
masonic
temple
as
i
eluded
to
earlier
is
particularly
well
suited
for
a
command
and
observation
post
because
it's
the
highest
post,
the
highest
building
in
that
area
and
if
the
court
will
forgive
a
personal
reference
if
one
would
go
there
as
i
have.
you
could
see
that
you
could
see
the
entire
zone
at
that
point
and
command
whatever
action
you
wanted
to
take.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
mr.
justice
brennan
the
facts
say
as
developed
in
three
documents.
one,
the
formal
presentation
before
the
oas
by
written
form,
two,
statement
of
facts
to
the
general
counsel
in
the
army
to
me
and
three,
an
oral
presentation
all
indicate
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
the
troops
moved
into
the
building
to
protect
the
troops.
those
were
the
statements
that
the
united
states
government
have
given
assigned
as
the
reason
for
the
seizure
of
these
buildings.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
stipulated
your
honor
on
the
basis
of
this
formal
presentations
by
the
government
and
those
facts
clearly
show
that
is
the
governments
own
version
of
the
fact
show
that
--
or
admit
that
the
buildings
were
taken
as
command
post,
observation
post
and
initially
seized
to
“protect
the
troops.”
i
believe
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
would
say
that
that
was
one
purpose
mr.
justice
marshall
but
the
paramount
purpose
was
to
protect
the
zone.
not
to
protect
this
particular
buildings
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
--
but
to
protect
the
zone.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
there
were
no
--
the
record
doesn't
indicate
that
there
were
molotov
cocktails
i
believe
in
the
part
of
the
rioters
in
the
building
at
the
time
when
the
troops
first
entered
and
cleared
them
out.
there
may
have
been
some
they
found
there
but
that
is
not
in
dispute
here.
we
don't
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
in
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
in
the
ymca
yes
and
no
claim
was
made
for
those.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
that's
correct,
and
they
were
quickly
put
out.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
would
say
not
that
building
again
mr.
justice
marshall,
they
were
lined
up
all
along
the
boundary
line
for
blocks
in
either
direction.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
no,
no
your
honor.
i'm
suggesting
that
where
the
army
takes
a
building,
seizes
it,
retires
into
it
and
use
it
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i'm
not
so
sure
that
they
were
driven
into
the
building
but
i
do
--
i
don't
--
i
think
that
in
this
case
it's
the
use
of
the
building,
that's
the
crux
of
a
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
in
front
of
the
building.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
believe
mr.
justice
fortas
indicated
we
can
call
that
withdraw
--
retiring
into.
i
take
the
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes
sir.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes
mr.
justice
black,
you've
stated
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
you
stated
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
no.
it's
the
seizure
and
use
of
these
buildings
to
protect
the
entire
zone.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
well,
as
i
indicated
to
mr.
justice
fortas
when
we
were
discussing
factual
criteria,
i
think
there
has
to
be
an
actual
use
as
going
into
the
building,
establishing
the
defense
fortification,
a
command
post.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes
your
honor
that
once
the
government
decides
that
the
ymca
and
the
masonic
temples
buildings
are
to
be
sacrificed,
if
they
are
to
be
sacrificed
by
the
common
good
then
the
public
first
must
make
good
and
that
we
can't
and
that
seems
to
me
the
central
issue
here
is
we
can't
deny
liability
on
this
ground
of
immediate
necessity
that
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
pardon
me
mr.
justice
fortas?
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
and
it
had
been
subsequently
destroyed?
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
the
record
is
not
clear
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
can't
speculate
what
would
happen.
there
were
rioters
there,
i'm
sorry
these
points
are
unclear.
in
--
the
troops
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
the
troops
cleared
out
the
rioters
out
of
the
ymca
initially,
that's
clear.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes,
and
then
they
took
up
positions
without
occupying
the
buildings
in
front
of
them.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
mr.
chief
justice,
i
frankly
cannot
tell
what
was
in
the
army's
mind
when
they
first
entered
the
zone.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
no
your
honor,
i
can
assume
one
way
or
another
on
that.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
think
the
sequence
is
important
mr.
chief
justice.
the
rioters
were
in
the
building
initially
when
the
troops
arrived.
the
troops
cleared
them
out,
took
positions
in
front.
they
haven't
taken
over
the
buildings
yet
at
that
point.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
no,
your
honor,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
armies
decision
to
use
these
buildings
and
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
army's
decision
not
to
effectively
defend
them,
they
just
knocked
the
fire
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
no,
i'm
sorry
if
i
have
created
a
misimpression
mr.
chief
justice.
i
--
we
contend
that
the
army
seized
the
buildings
for
as
mr.
justice
black
indicated
for
the
defense
of
the
entire
zone.
and
it
was
a
prudent
decision
to
withdraw
in
there
but
our
point
is
when
our
buildings
are
seized
and
used
for
a
governmental
purpose,
the
government
as
a
whole
should
pay.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
excuse
me,
i
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes,
there
is
mr.
chief
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
think
again
it's
the
causal
relationship
between
the
buildings
that
the
army
were
in
and
the
armies
were
not
when
read
as
a
whole.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
there
was
a
small
--
may
i,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
there
was
a
small
fire
in
the
ymca
alone
and
that
was
quickly
extinguished
and
that's
no
part
of
the
total
lost
by
the
army.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
if
the
army
hadn't
cleared
that
building?
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
don't
know
mr.
chief
justice
except
that
was
not
the
portion
of
the
ymca
that
was
destroyed
because
it
was
a
different,
it
was
a
brick
construction
primarily
whereas
the
portion
that
was
destroyed
was
wooden.
so
it's
not
clear
that
the
building
would
necessarily
have
been
lost.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
were
any
other
buildings
destroyed?
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes,
the
buildings
by
the
hash
marks,
the
ymca,
the
masonic
temple
and
the
old
commissary
building
which
is
here
owned
by
the
government
and
the
sequence
of
the
mob
was
first
at
this
then
at
the
masonic
temple
and
then
later
at
this.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes,
there
were
troops
in
the
commissary
building.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
that
--
record's
unclear
on
that
and
i
do
yield
to
the
solicitor
general
in
pointing
out
that
was
burned
and
i'm
not
so
sure
whether
troops
surrendered
or
not.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes,
yes,
i
refer
the
court
to
our
appendix
in
our
brief
where
we
show
on
page
220,
exhibit
e10
on
the
back
of
the
appendix.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
just
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
e10
on
page
228,
the
building,
the
tall
building
on
the
left
is
the
masonic
temple
and
the
observation
point
was
on
top
of
it
and
the
building
on
the
right
is
the
ymca
and
as
you
can
see
of
to
the
right
the
damaged
portion
of
it.
this
was
taken
shortly
after
the
destruction
of
ymca.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
e10
and
e
on
the
preceding
page
219
shows
--
those
are
pictures
of
the
troops
inside
the
ymca
before
they
were
driven
out
by
the
fire.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
the
ymca
lost
a
total
wing
which
was
in
the
nature
of
an
auditorium
which
is
primarily
of
a
wood
construction.
the
main
building
where
the
initial
fire
was
mr.
justice
marshall
was
not
substantially
destroyed.
it
was
the
wing
to
the
ymca
that
was
lost
and
the
masonic
temple,
it
was
a
second
and
third
floor
fire
damage
and
interior
but
the
masonic
temple
was
made
of
brick
and
mortar
constructions
so
it
really
didn't
go
despite
continues
efforts
to
set
it
to
fire.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes,
being
--
the
records
clear
on
that,
being
thrown
in
to
the
second
floor
over
a
prolonged
period
of
time.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
thank
you.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
we
have
made
arrangements
with
the
petitioner
in
the
solicitor
general's
office
for
the
use
of
a
diagram,
if
we
may
that
the
marshal
is
bringing
in
at
this
moment.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
may
just
in
advance
say
that
this
is
an
action
for
just
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
it
arises
out
of
the
united
states
army's
seizure
and
use
of
private
property,
in
this
case
buildings
belonging
to
the
petitioners
during
the
panamanian
riots
of
1962.
the
issue
before
this
court
as
we
view
it
is
whether
the
court
of
claims
correctly
held
the
that
u.s.
military
forces
may
sieze
and
use
private
property
without
incurring
a
duty
to
provide
compensation
under
the
fifth
amendment
whenever
they
are
faced
with
a
“immediate
necessity.”
the
facts
are
as
follows:
if
i
may
briefly
refer
to
them.
this
is
a
chart
that
was
prepared
by
the
united
states
government
for
presentation
to
the
organization
of
american
states
following
the
panamanian
riots
in
the
course
of
a
charge
that
united
states
was
the
aggressor
in
these
riots.
its
accuracy
has
been
stipulated
too.
the
buildings
that
are
here
today
are
the
real
building,
the
real
property
in
question.
this
is
the
masonic
temple
and
this
is
the
ymca
belonging
to
the
petitioners
here.
excuse
me.
this
is
cristobal

on

were
called
to

to
request
from

ordered
to
clear
the

starting
here
on

street
moved
down
11th

cleared
the
zone
of
rioters,
move
behind
the
ymca
and
the
masonic
temple,
had
brief
scuffles
with
rioters
who
were
then
in
both
of
those
buildings,
evicted
them,
moved

out
to

out

this
is
approximately
from

to
midnight
on
the
night
of

shortly
after
midnight,
they
began
to
receive

station
in
the

they're
actually
out
in

point.
mr.

point.
mr.

jacks
yes,
it
is
mr.
chief
justice.
both
the
masonic
temple
and
the
ymca
are
the
petitioners
in
this
action.
troops
are
stationed
along
bolivar
avenue
in
11th
street,
they
began
to
receive
sniper
fire
and
at
that
point
the
local
commander
ordered
them
to
withdraw
into
the
ymca,
masonic
temple
and
the
old
commissary.
throughout
the
night,
snipers
continued
to
harass
the
army
troops
inside
the
building.
in
the
morning
of
the
10th,
the
mob
began
to
form
over
here
on
bolivar
avenue
and
directed
a
concentrated
molotov
cocktail
attack
first
at
the
ymca
where
our
company,
a
140
men
of
troops
were
housed.
they
finally
--
about
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
of
the
10th,
succeeded
in
setting
it
on
fire
forcing
the
troops
to
evacuate
at
which
point
they
moved
down
the
street
and
began
to
concentrate
on
the
masonic
temple
in
which
the
army
not
only
had
troops
but
it
established
a
command
post
and
an
observation
post.
there
is
a
photograph
in
the
back
of
the
appendix
which
shows
the
masonic
temple.
it
shows
the
roof
as
being
higher
than
the
other
buildings
in
the
area
and
having
the
shield
that
parapet.
it
was
from
that
position
that
the
army
was
able
to
command
this
entire
area
both
for
observation
and
later
in
attempts
to
quell
the
rioters.
the
mob
was
unable
to
set

fires

they
there
upon
moved
down
to
the
old
commissary
not
owned
by

petitioners,
owned
by
the
government
and
finally
succeeded
in
setting
that
on
fire
with
molotov
cocktails
in
the
next
day.
on
the
basis
of
these
facts,
petitioners
made
claim
first
in
the
part
of
the
army
and
then
with
the
court
of
claims
contending
that
there
was
liability
where
the
army
had
siezed
and
used
petitioner's
buildings
as
sources

this
is
attached
to
the
appendix
mr.
chief
justice.
the
last
page
of
the
appendix
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
on
the
basis
of
these
facts
the
court
of
claims
held
that
there
was
no
liability
for
the
seizure
and
use
of
these
buildings.
that
is
the
ymca
and
the
masonic
temple,
holding
that
there
was
no
liability
for
occupancy
of
private
property
which
is
immediately
necessary
for
the
safety
of
troops,
or
to
meet
an
emergency
threatening
great
public
danger.
judge
davis
dissented,
judge
davis
said
that
on
his
basis
of
the
applicable
case
law,
he
thought
it
clear
that
the
government
is
liable
where
at
first
takes
the
property
for
it
s
own
military
use
and
then
exposes
the
place
to
enemy
attack
or
revokes
it
leading
to
injury
or
destruction.
in
this
connection,
judge
davis
said
and
we
should
emphasize
this,
there
is
no
exception
from
liability
as
i
read
the
materials
for
temporary
seizures
for
military
use
in
the
face
of
imminent
hostility
or
to
meet
an
emergency.
once
the
property
is
taken
for
a
military
use,
the
government
is
responsible
for
a
subsequent
injury
no
matter
how
quickly
that
follows
upon
seizure.
thus
in
our
view
the
issue
here
between
the
majority
and
the
dissent
below
is
--
centers
on
all
the
important
question
on
whether
an
immediate
necessity
or
imminent
hostility
creates
an
exception
to
the
general
duty
to
provide
compensation.
we
think
it
does
not
and
cannot
that
the
court
of
claims
decision
if
allowed
to
stand
creates
a
grave
and
unwarranted
threat
to
the
citizens
right
of
compensation.
for
if
an
immediate
necessity
is
sufficient
to
confer
absolute
immunity
upon
the
government
whenever
it
seizes
and
uses
private
property
then
we
are
indeed
faced
with
a
new
era
of
governmental
power.
the
basic
issue
is
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
no,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
would
characterize
the
factual
element
of
the
issue
as
to
whether
there
was
a
seizure
and
a
use
for
a
military
purpose
and
we
take
the
position
as
that
expressed
by
judge
davis
below
that
once
there's
a
seizure
and
use
by
the
u.s.
armed
forces
for
military
purpose,
there's
a
liability
regardless
of
how
the
damage
occurs.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes,
your
honor
although
that's
not
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
but
i
would
contend
that
there
would
be
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
because
in
that
case
your
honor,
the
army
once
it
took
those
buildings.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i'm
using
taking
not
on
the
constitutional
sense
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
all
right.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
once
the
army
seized
those
buildings.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
would
say
there
would
be
liability
because
by
so
doing
under
the
established
case
law,
it
then
makes
--
exposes
those
buildings
to
special
response
on
the
part
of
the
opposing
forces.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
would
say
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
may
i
qualify
that.
i
don't
think
that
i'd
make
quite
that
broad
a
statement,
i
would
say
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
right.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
would
say
the
criteria
would
be
as
follows
mr.
justice
fortas.
first
of
all,
there
must
be
a
necessity
which
justifies
the
seizure.
not
going
to
acquire
their
duty
of
compensations
available
but
whether
there's
authority
to
take
it.
then,
the
use
must
be
actual
and
not
constructive
or
passive.
by
that,
i
mean
the
army
has
to
withdraw
into
the
building,
use
it
as
a
command
post,
the
defense
fortress
and
observation
force
as
opposed
to
merely
standing
in
front
of
the
building
or
passing
through
for
30
seconds.
then,
the
use
of
the
army
thirdly,
gets
out
of
that
building
must
have
some
benefit
to
the
government
as
was
present
in
this
case.
it
can
also
have
a
benefit
to
the
owner
but
it
must
have
a
benefit
to
the
government.
then,
i
should
suggest
fourthly
that
that
benefit
should
relate
to
the
specific
mission
that
the
army
is
involved
in
that
particular
case
as
it
was
here.
and
that
finally,
that
you
should
be
of
sufficient
scope
and
duration.
now,
this
will
depend
upon
the
facts
of
each
case
but
to
make
it
clear
that
it
was
more
than
fleeting
or
merely
consequential.
in
this
case,
the
masonic
temple
was
occupied
for
a
period
of
seven
days.
the
ymca
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
until
the
troops
were
forced
to
evacuate
it.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
no,
your
honor,
and
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
would
say
that
is
a
compensable
taking
mr.
justice
fortas.
and
that
the
elements
are
substantially
somewhere
to
those
involved
here.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
not
necessarily
mr.
justice
fortas
because
i
think
this
is
a
stronger
case.
here,
we're
involved
with
buildings
that
were
held
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
in
which
there
was
a
substantial
number
of
men
involved
to
use
throughout
the
riots
and
we're
here,
we
have
--
although
we
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
make
out
liability.
here,
we
have
a
fairly
strong
evidence
of
a
causal
connection
between
the
seizure
and
the
result
in
destruction.
the
point
being
that
just
the
buildings
occupied
by
the
troops
is
indicated
by
the
hash
marks
or
the
ones
that
were
substantially
destroyed.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
no,
your
honor.
if
i
may
correct
you
on
the
record,
the
facts
are
that
the
masonic,
there
were
rioters
in
the
masonic
temple,
in
the
ymca
that
were
looting
to
just
some
extent
destroying
the
interior
when
the
army
first
arrived.
they
moved
those
rioters
out
of
the
buildings.
we
don't
make
any
claim
for
that
damage.
the
army
then
took
up
positions
in
the
street.
they
were
subsequently
forced
to
retire
into
both
buildings,
both
buildings
at
once.
that
is
the
masonic
temple
and
the
ymca.
and
the
damage
to
those
structures
by
a
molotov
cocktail
occurred
the
day
and
the
second
day
following
that.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
well,
because
your
honor,
that
damage
to
be
precise
if
i
may
on
the
basis
of
the
record,
the
damage
--
the
initial
damage
is
all
done
by
the
rioters,
a
very
little
--
they
have
got
in
and
they
were
looting
the
interiors
of
the
buildings
and
the
army
moved
them
out.
and
so,
there
is
no
damage
really
done
by
the
army
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
would
not
have
been
liable,
your
honor,
because
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
it
would
not
because
there's
no
use
made
of
that
building,
your
honor.
that
building
is
really
in
that
case,
a
random
consequence
of
battle
and
that
just
happened
to
be
in
the
way
of
the
exchange
but
the
army
never
seized
and
used
that
building.
either
the
key,
the
pivotal
point
your
honor
is
that
army
has
to
take
and
retire
to
and
use
and
at
that
point
as
judge
davis
said
liability
attaches.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
it
went
there
mr.
justice
marshall
for
the
purposes
of
clearing
the
rioters
from
the
zone
and
protecting
the
zone
in
general.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
including
those
two
buildings,
yes.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
the
use
of
the
building
we
contend
mr.
justice
marshall
was
primarily
to
protect
the
troops.
that's
spelled
out
on
the
record,
which
is
stipulated,
too.
that
was
the
reason
the
army
withdrew
into
the
building,
was
to
protect
the
troops.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
if
they
had
been
destroyed,
there'd
be
no
claim
here,
your
honor,
because
there
had
been
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
wouldn't
--
it's
not
clear,
it's
not
clear.
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
did
either
of
them
have
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes,
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
troops
inside
the
buildings.
we
mean
the
privately
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
no.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
it's
not
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
may
i
rephrase
my
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
think
that
they
withdrew
into
the
buildings
to
protect
the
troops
primarily.
if
they
had
not
gone
into
the
buildings
and
the
buildings
have
been
lost,
there
would
be
no
claim.
for
example,
there
were
troop
stationed
all
behind
here,
but
never
in
these
two
buildings
here,
yet
these
buildings
were
never
destroyed.
we
don't
contend
that
it's
necessary
to
show
that
the
mob
moved
just
against
the
buildings
that
the
army
occupied
to
make
out
our
test,
because
once
there
is
seizure
and
use,
there's
liability
but
we
think
that
is
an
important
point.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
then
i
would
not
be
making
the
claim
here
today,
mr.
justice
white.
i
would
contend
although
that's
a
close
question
that
that
falls
within
the
true
battle
damage
situation.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
think
that
could
be
argued
both
way.
if
you
could
show
that
had
put
the
buildings
up
as
a
buffer,
that
they'd
in
effect
deliberately
sacrifice
them
to
protect
the
troops,
then
i
think
we'd
have
caltex
and
we
would
be
prepared
to
argue
as
we
do
in
point
number
two
of
our
brief
that
caltex
should
be
overruled.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
would
not
without
overruling
caltex
i
believe
in
that
case
if
they
used
--
if
they
sacrifice
the
buildings
to
protect
the
troops,
but
we
of
course
we
contend
that's
not
the
effect.
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
i
should
like
to
use
my
remaining
time
in
rebuttal.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
thank
you.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
should
only
like
to
comment,
i
believe
mr.
justice
black
you
asked
how
long
were
the
troops
in
the
ymca.
it
was
until
about
2
o'clock
on
the
afternoon
of
the
10th
for
14
hours
and
they
left
only
because
the
fire
started
by
the
molotov
cocktails
drove
them
out.
they
had
to
abandon
the
building,
they
could
no
longer
inhabit.
i
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
how
the
troops
decided,
you
mean
to
take
over
these
buildings?
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
the
record
is
not
clear
as
to
when
that
choice
occurred
but
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
apparent
for
--
hence
to
say
that
when
the
troops
in
the
street
in
front
of
these
buildings
began
to
receive
sniper
fire
and
that
it
was
a
prudent
decision
to
withdraw
into
these
buildings,
one.
two,
the
masonic
temple
as
i
eluded
to
earlier
is
particularly
well
suited
for
a
command
and
observation
post
because
it's
the
highest
post,
the
highest
building
in
that
area
and
if
the
court
will
forgive
a
personal
reference
if
one
would
go
there
as
i
have.
you
could
see
that
you
could
see
the
entire
zone
at
that
point
and
command
whatever
action
you
wanted
to
take.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
mr.
justice
brennan
the
facts
say
as
developed
in
three
documents.
one,
the
formal
presentation
before
the
oas
by
written
form,
two,
statement
of
facts
to
the
general
counsel
in
the
army
to
me
and
three,
an
oral
presentation
all
indicate
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
the
troops
moved
into
the
building
to
protect
the
troops.
those
were
the
statements
that
the
united
states
government
have
given
assigned
as
the
reason
for
the
seizure
of
these
buildings.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
stipulated
your
honor
on
the
basis
of
this
formal
presentations
by
the
government
and
those
facts
clearly
show
that
is
the
governments
own
version
of
the
fact
show
that
--
or
admit
that
the
buildings
were
taken
as
command
post,
observation
post
and
initially
seized
to
“protect
the
troops.”
i
believe
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
would
say
that
that
was
one
purpose
mr.
justice
marshall
but
the
paramount
purpose
was
to
protect
the
zone.
not
to
protect
this
particular
buildings
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
--
but
to
protect
the
zone.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
there
were
no
--
the
record
doesn't
indicate
that
there
were
molotov
cocktails
i
believe
in
the
part
of
the
rioters
in
the
building
at
the
time
when
the
troops
first
entered
and
cleared
them
out.
there
may
have
been
some
they
found
there
but
that
is
not
in
dispute
here.
we
don't
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
in
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
in
the
ymca
yes
and
no
claim
was
made
for
those.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
that's
correct,
and
they
were
quickly
put
out.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
would
say
not
that
building
again
mr.
justice
marshall,
they
were
lined
up
all
along
the
boundary
line
for
blocks
in
either
direction.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
no,
no
your
honor.
i'm
suggesting
that
where
the
army
takes
a
building,
seizes
it,
retires
into
it
and
use
it
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i'm
not
so
sure
that
they
were
driven
into
the
building
but
i
do
--
i
don't
--
i
think
that
in
this
case
it's
the
use
of
the
building,
that's
the
crux
of
a
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
in
front
of
the
building.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
believe
mr.
justice
fortas
indicated
we
can
call
that
withdraw
--
retiring
into.
i
take
the
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes
sir.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes
mr.
justice
black,
you've
stated
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
you
stated
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
no.
it's
the
seizure
and
use
of
these
buildings
to
protect
the
entire
zone.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
well,
as
i
indicated
to
mr.
justice
fortas
when
we
were
discussing
factual
criteria,
i
think
there
has
to
be
an
actual
use
as
going
into
the
building,
establishing
the
defense
fortification,
a
command
post.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes
your
honor
that
once
the
government
decides
that
the
ymca
and
the
masonic
temples
buildings
are
to
be
sacrificed,
if
they
are
to
be
sacrificed
by
the
common
good
then
the
public
first
must
make
good
and
that
we
can't
and
that
seems
to
me
the
central
issue
here
is
we
can't
deny
liability
on
this
ground
of
immediate
necessity
that
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
pardon
me
mr.
justice
fortas?
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
and
it
had
been
subsequently
destroyed?
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
the
record
is
not
clear
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
can't
speculate
what
would
happen.
there
were
rioters
there,
i'm
sorry
these
points
are
unclear.
in
--
the
troops
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
the
troops
cleared
out
the
rioters
out
of
the
ymca
initially,
that's
clear.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes,
and
then
they
took
up
positions
without
occupying
the
buildings
in
front
of
them.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
mr.
chief
justice,
i
frankly
cannot
tell
what
was
in
the
army's
mind
when
they
first
entered
the
zone.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
no
your
honor,
i
can
assume
one
way
or
another
on
that.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
think
the
sequence
is
important
mr.
chief
justice.
the
rioters
were
in
the
building
initially
when
the
troops
arrived.
the
troops
cleared
them
out,
took
positions
in
front.
they
haven't
taken
over
the
buildings
yet
at
that
point.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
no,
your
honor,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
armies
decision
to
use
these
buildings
and
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
army's
decision
not
to
effectively
defend
them,
they
just
knocked
the
fire
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
no,
i'm
sorry
if
i
have
created
a
misimpression
mr.
chief
justice.
i
--
we
contend
that
the
army
seized
the
buildings
for
as
mr.
justice
black
indicated
for
the
defense
of
the
entire
zone.
and
it
was
a
prudent
decision
to
withdraw
in
there
but
our
point
is
when
our
buildings
are
seized
and
used
for
a
governmental
purpose,
the
government
as
a
whole
should
pay.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
excuse
me,
i
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes,
there
is
mr.
chief
--
yes,
sir.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
think
again
it's
the
causal
relationship
between
the
buildings
that
the
army
were
in
and
the
armies
were
not
when
read
as
a
whole.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
there
was
a
small
--
may
i,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
there
was
a
small
fire
in
the
ymca
alone
and
that
was
quickly
extinguished
and
that's
no
part
of
the
total
lost
by
the
army.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
if
the
army
hadn't
cleared
that
building?
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
i
don't
know
mr.
chief
justice
except
that
was
not
the
portion
of
the
ymca
that
was
destroyed
because
it
was
a
different,
it
was
a
brick
construction
primarily
whereas
the
portion
that
was
destroyed
was
wooden.
so
it's
not
clear
that
the
building
would
necessarily
have
been
lost.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
were
any
other
buildings
destroyed?
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes,
the
buildings
by
the
hash
marks,
the
ymca,
the
masonic
temple
and
the
old
commissary
building
which
is
here
owned
by
the
government
and
the
sequence
of
the
mob
was
first
at
this
then
at
the
masonic
temple
and
then
later
at
this.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes,
there
were
troops
in
the
commissary
building.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
that
--
record's
unclear
on
that
and
i
do
yield
to
the
solicitor
general
in
pointing
out
that
was
burned
and
i'm
not
so
sure
whether
troops
surrendered
or
not.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes,
yes,
i
refer
the
court
to
our
appendix
in
our
brief
where
we
show
on
page
220,
exhibit
e10
on
the
back
of
the
appendix.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
just
--
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
e10
on
page
228,
the
building,
the
tall
building
on
the
left
is
the
masonic
temple
and
the
observation
point
was
on
top
of
it
and
the
building
on
the
right
is
the
ymca
and
as
you
can
see
of
to
the
right
the
damaged
portion
of
it.
this
was
taken
shortly
after
the
destruction
of
ymca.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
e10
and
e
on
the
preceding
page
219
shows
--
those
are
pictures
of
the
troops
inside
the
ymca
before
they
were
driven
out
by
the
fire.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
the
ymca
lost
a
total
wing
which
was
in
the
nature
of
an
auditorium
which
is
primarily
of
a
wood
construction.
the
main
building
where
the
initial
fire
was
mr.
justice
marshall
was
not
substantially
destroyed.
it
was
the
wing
to
the
ymca
that
was
lost
and
the
masonic
temple,
it
was
a
second
and
third
floor
fire
damage
and
interior
but
the
masonic
temple
was
made
of
brick
and
mortar
constructions
so
it
really
didn't
go
despite
continues
efforts
to
set
it
to
fire.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
yes,
being
--
the
records
clear
on
that,
being
thrown
in
to
the
second
floor
over
a
prolonged
period
of
time.
mr.
ronald
a.
jacks
thank
you.
