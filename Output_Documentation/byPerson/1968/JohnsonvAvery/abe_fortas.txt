justice
abe
fortas
well,
aren't
there
some
states
which
provide
legal
services
for
prisoners?
it
seems
to
me
that
--
was
it
california's
brief,
amicus,
here?
justice
abe
fortas
but
some
assistance?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
clerical
stuff,
do
they
--
don't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
he
set
up
an
office
in
nashville
and
held
himself
out
to
do
precisely
this.
don't
you
think,
by
association,
it'd
be
a
kind
of
concern
by
whether
that
was
a
practice
of
law?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
fox,
i
understand
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
fox,
do
you
still
argue
that
there's
no
standing
here?
justice
abe
fortas
but
if
we
--
but,
this
case
seems
to
me,
at
least
arguably,
to
be
in
a
rather
peculiar
posture
because
i
--
if
we
should
vindicate
the
right
of
an
inmate
to
consult
with
a
fellow
inmate
for
the
first
inmate's
benefit,
that's
one
thing
but,
here,
what
we're
asked
to
do
really,
as
i
understand
it,
is
to
hold
that
an
inmate
has
the
right
as
a
matter
of
regular
practice,
isn't
that
so,
to
help
other
inmates
in
preparing
petitions
for
post
conviction
relief?
justice
abe
fortas
it's
a
little
puzzling
as
to
whether
it's
a
question
of
standing
or
something
else,
but
i
was
just
wondering
whether
that
really
is
indifferent
from
the
kind
of
case
--
another
case
we
have
on
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court,
i've
forgotten
the
jurisdiction,
in
which
an
inmate
himself
applies
for
relief
because
prison
authorities
won't
let
him
consult
with
other
inmates
and
provides
no
alternative.
justice
abe
fortas
petitioner
here
is,
if
i
correctly
understand
this,
is
asking
us
not
only
to
release
him
from
what,
off-hand,
seems
to
be
a
very
onerous
treatment
by
the
tennessee
prison
authorities,
but
he
also
asks
us
to
establish
his
right
to
engage
in
the
practice
of
furnishing
this
kind
of
advice
and
assistance
to
other
inmates.
do
i
correctly
follow
as
this
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
didn't
think
that
“what
is
too
unreasonable”?
justice
abe
fortas
put
him
in
solitary
confinement?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
that
means
solitary
confinement,
doesn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
there
are
lots
of
penalties
involved
in
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law,
but
that's
kind
of
a
new
one,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
this
petitioner
wasn't
put
in
solitary
confinement
because
he
wasn't
practicing
law
well,
was
he?
