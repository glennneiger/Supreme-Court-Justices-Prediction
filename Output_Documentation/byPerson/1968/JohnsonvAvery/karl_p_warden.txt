mr.
karl
p.
warden
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
counsel
for
william
joe
johnson
who
is
a
prisoner
in
the
tennessee
state
penitentiary
in
nashville,
tennessee.
as
of
the
time
of
this
argument
today,
william
joe
johnson
has
served
approximately
three
years
in
solitary
confinement
or
in
maximum
security
or
in
a
segregated
environment
within
the
penitentiary.
this
confinement
is
over
and
above
that
confinement
called
for
by
his
sentence,
which
is
a
life
sentence
for
the
crime
of
rape.
the
reason
for
this
extraordinary
confinement
is
because
he
has
violated
one
rule
of
the
tennessee
state
prison
system
is
that
rule
is
here
being
challenged
today,
and
that
rule
is
that
no
inmate
will
advice,
assist,
or
otherwise
contract
to
aid
another
either
with
or
without
a
fee
to
prepare
writs
or
other
legal
matters.
the
united
states
district
court
that
first
heard
this
case
determined
that
his
confinement
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
that
it
was
in
violation
of
title
28
united
states
code
annotated
section
2242
and
it
was
in
violation
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court.
our
argument
here
today
seeks
to
have
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
reversed
to
have
further
enforcement
of
this
prison
rule
ended
and
to
have
william
joe
johnson
return
to
the
general
prison
population
and
these
lib
--
these
unnecessary
restraints
on
his
liberties
ended.
now,
the
basis
for
our
argument
is
five-fold.
the
two
major
points
that
we
wish
to
make
are
that,
first
off,
the
state
of
tennessee,
by
enforcing
this
prison
rule
and
by
providing
no
alternative
assistance,
has
effectively
blocked
access
to
the
courts
by
those
prisoners
who
are
indigent
and
inarticulate
or
illiterate,
and
that
to
so
prevent
these
people
from
being
heard
as
a
violation
of
due
process,
a
violation
of
equal
protection,
and
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
freedoms
of
speech
and
right
to
protect,
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances.
and,
our
second
principle
point
is
that
this
prison
regulation
is
not
a
proper
exercise
of
the
state's
limited
power
to
regulate
the
practice
of
law
for
two
reasons.
one,
this
is
not
the
practice
of
law
and,
two,
that
even
if
it
should
be
considered
the
practice
of
law,
it's
beyond
the
power
of
the
strait
--
of
the
state
to
restrict
this
particular
kind
of
practice.
our
further
points
are
that
title
28
section
2242
of
the
united
states
code,
annotated,
reflects
the
ancient
common
law
right
of
one
layman
to
prepare,
sign,
and
verify
petitions
of
habeas
corpus
for
those
who
cannot
help
themselves.
and,
the
final
two
points,
are
that
the
petitioner
does
have
standing
to
raise
these
issues
and
that
was
the
holding
of
both
the
district
and
the
court
of
appeals
and,
finally,
that
this
is
a
proper
case
and
circumstance
for
federal
courts
to
intervene
with
state
prison
management.
and,
apparently,
this
has
been
agreed
to
by
the
state
of
tennessee
in
its
supplemental
brief
provided
that
the
court
finds
that
these
regulations
are
in
violation
of
federal
right.
now,
as
to
our
first
point,
it's
clear
that
a
prisoner
who
can
employ
an
attorney
will
be
fully
and
well-heard
by
whatever
court
he
wishes
to
petition,
but
it's
equally
clear
that
if
this
prisoner
is
indigent,
that
he
only
has
then
four
alternatives.
one
of
these
is
to
be
able
to
talk
some
lawyer
into
representing
him
for
free.
the
second
is
to
proceed
pro
se,
the
third
is
to
get
help
from
someone
untrained
in
law,
and
the
fourth
is
just
to
forget
about
it
all
together
and
let
his
claim
go
by
the
boards.
now,
as
to
the
first
of
these
alternatives,
if
he
can
talk
a
lawyer
into
taking
a
case,
all
of
us
who
practice
law
know
what
happens
to
the
attorney
who
agrees
to
help
one
indigent
prisoner,
he's
immediately
inundated
with
letters
from
not
only
that
prison,
but
from
every
prison
in
the
country
requesting
similar
aid.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
california
has
an
amicus
brief
here,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
that
california
provides
counsel
for
indigent
prisoners.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
they
provide
the
assistance
of
prison
guards
and
chaplains,
apparently,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
they
apparently,
yes,
sir.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
your
honor,
although
--
mr.
karl
p.
warden
although,
i
expect
to
argue
a
bit
today
that
these
forms
are
in
fact
not
much
better
than
the
no
assistance
at
all
that
the
state
of
tennessee
provides.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
your
honor,
in
the
event
that
this
attorney
does
receive
these
letters,
what
happens
ultimately
is
that
the
claims
--
the
just
claims
and
the
unjust
claims
are
like
all
going
away
splash
kit.
now,
while
we
ought
to
applaud
an
attorney
who
is
willing
to
help
an
occasional
indigent
prisoner.
we
still
cannot
rely
on
causal
or
whimsical
charity
to
preserve
the
constitutional
guarantees
of
persons
and
fritz
in
the
united
states
and
it's
not
a
sufficient
answer
here
to
say
that
prison
authorities
will
help
these
people.
first
off,
there's
no
showing
that
these
prison
authorities,
the
guards,
chaplains,
clerical
help,
or
any
more
competent
to
provide
assistance
that
is
a
fellow
inmate.
and,
secondly,
it's
clear
that
the
prisoner
knows
full
well
that
the
interest
of
his
keeper
and
his
own
interests
are
not
absolutely
identical.
there
is
and
there
always
will
be
a
real
credibility
gap
between
the
inmate
and
his
keeper,
and
the
prisoner
is
going
to
want
someone
he
can
turn
to,
someone
he
can
talk
to,
someone
he
can
trust,
if
not
his
lawyer,
then
his
friend.
and,
his
friend
is
much
more
likely
to
be
a
fellow
inmate
than
it
is
to
be
his
keeper.
and,
i
think
that
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
that
the
legal
profession
and
the
government
has
spent
in
the
past
few
years
trying
to
bridge
the
communication
gap
between
the
poor
and
the
courts,
the
legal
profession,
by
moving
law
offices
out
in
the
neighborhoods
and
by
allowing
forms
of
lay
intermediary
assistance
all
show
that
this
credibility
gap
here
is
a
very
real
thing
and
ought
to
be
recognized.
and,
finally,
on
that
point
as
on
the
side,
if
it
is
the
practice
of
law
for
an
inmate
to
help
write
petitions,
why
is
it
not
the
practice
of
law
when
it's
done
by
a
prison
guard
or
a
chaplain,
as
apparently
is
done
in
california?
the
activities
of
--
mr.
karl
p.
warden
your
honor,
there
is
not
one
shred
of
evidence
in
this
case
that
my
petitioner
has
charged
anyone
for
his
services.
i
don't
deny
that
prisoners
could
charge.
i
would
deny
that
it
would
be
a
proper
thing
to
do,
of
course.
the
activities
of
the
petitioner
here
are
attacked
as
being
the
practice
of
law
and
it's
said
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
regulate
the
practice
of
law
and
that,
since
petitioner
was
practicing
law,
he
can
be
properly
stopped
by
the
state
prison
authorities.
well,
we
claim
first
that
this
is
not
the
practice
of
law,
that
there
was
no
claim
here
whatsoever
to
represent
these
prisoners
in
court
that
there
was
no
pursuit
of
these
cases
beyond
the
minimal
help
of
helping
them
articulate
what
their
claim
was,
that
he
did
not
stand
and
verify
these
petitions
for
the
inmates,
that
he
returned
these
petitions
to
the
inmates
and
they
signed
them
and
verified
them
themselves
even
if
they
had
to
sign
it
with
an
“x”
as
happened
in
some
instances.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
sir.
i'm
absolutely
certain
that
the
national
bar
association
would
be
concerned.
they're
a
little
bit
fearful
about
me
being
up
here
today,
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
--
mr.
karl
p.
warden
your
honor,
i
think
that
that's
only
one
of
the
points
before
us
today.
i
think
there's
a
very
real
question
here
of
first
amendment
guarantees
and
i
think
that
goes
beyond
the
question
of
--
raised
directly
by
2242.
i
think
that
22
--
mr.
karl
p.
warden
the
district
court
did
that,
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
but
they
also
found
that
this
was
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
act
on
the
part
of
the
federal
prison
authorities,
which
was
a
denial
of
--
as
equal
protection
to
those
persons
who
could
not
articulate
their
own
claim.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
you
would
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
claim.
but,
of
course,
we
had
to
raise
the
constitutional
claim
because
that's
one
facet
to
our
argument.
i
don't'
think
you
have
to
reach
that
in
order
to
decide
this
case
but,
if
i
may
say
so,
sir,
i
think
you
ought
to.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
sir,
you
certainly
would,
in
order
to
adopt
our
view
of
the
case.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
sir,
it
has.
yes,
sir.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
he's
a
state
prisoner,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
i
suppose
so,
your
honor.
all
william
joe
johnson
has
done
in
this
case
is
to
help
these
men
articulate
those
things
that
they
would
have
said
for
themselves
if
they
had
been
able
to
say
them
for
him
--
themselves.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
sir?
mr.
karl
p.
warden
sir
--
mr.
karl
p.
warden
sir,
both
the
federal
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
he
had
standing.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
it's
raised
in
the
california
amicus
brief.
it
was
not
raised
by
the
state
of
tennessee.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
your
honor,
i
will
try
to.
over
and
above
the
question
of
whether
the
two
lower
courts
agreed
that
he
had
standing,
he's
in
solitary
confinement
now
for
the
violation
of
this
rule
and
this
rule
is
the
one
we're
here
challenging
today,
and
in
order
to
challenge
this
rule
today
we
have
to
show
why
it
is
in
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
these
indigent
illiterate
prisoners.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
for
almost
three
years.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
he
was
turned
loose
at
the
end
of
the
time
that
the
district
court
decided
this
case,
your
honor,
and
i'm
going
outside
of
the
record,
he
was
put
in
the
day
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
came
down.
now,
there
were
breaks
in
this
total
three-year
period
because
he
would
promise
he
wouldn't
do
it
anymore,
and
they'd
turn
him
loose
and
he'd
do
it
again.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
sir.
he
wasn't
very
trustworthy
about
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
this
man
comes
closer,
your
honor,
to
being
a
modern
day
don
quixote
than
anyone
i
ever
heard
of.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
never
doubted
the
common
law
right
of
one
layman
to
petitioner
or
another
layman
when
the
one
that's
being
held
captive
could
not
speak
for
himself
and
when
the
one
who's
doing
the
petitioning
is
not
an
officious
intermeddler.
at
most,
william
joe
johnson
here
was
a
lay
intermediary.
all
he
ever
did
was
call
the
court's
attention
to
these
men.
he
did
not
solicit
this.
he
did
not
charge.
he
did
not
benefit
in
any
way,
except
the
satisfaction
that
one
human
being
gets
from
helping
another.
but,
even
if
this
court
should
find
that
his
activity
was
the
practice
of
law,
and
we
vigorously
maintain
it
was
not,
still
the
state's
power
to
regulate
stopped
short
of
the
power
to
restrict
unsophisticated
persons
from
seeking
legal
redress
in
the
courts
with
their
claimed
unlawful
imprisonment.
both
federal
and
state
law
provide
a
route
by
which
an
imprisoned
person
can
petition
for
a
release
from
imprisonment.
but,
by
effectively
denying
to
an
identifiable
class
of
persons
the
right
to
use
this
law
here
by
making
the
route
impossible
for
the
indigent,
inarticulate,
and
illiterate,
this
post
conviction
remedy
becomes
illusory.
this
is
not
just
a
deprivation
of
first
amendment
rights,
but
it's
also
then
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
your
honor,
unfortunately,
that's
true.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
no
inmate
would
be
allowed
to,
and
the
rules
--
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
rationale
of
that
case
would
be
entirely
appropriate
here,
although
this
man
was
operating
outside
of
an
environment
where
there
was
a
rule
that
prohibited
any
help
at
all,
and
that's
exactly
what
this
rule
does.
this
rule
does
not
cut
off
help
just
for
illegitimate
claims.
it
cuts
off
help
for
all
claims,
and
that's
the
only
way
it
can
be
viewed
because
these
people
can't
read,
they
can't
write,
and
the
tennessee
statistics
--
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
it
was,
your
honor,
except
that
it's
my
understanding
that
the
man
who
filed
the
petition
for
him
was
not
a
fellow
inmate
but
was
someone
on
the
outside.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
an
interest
of
the
state
here
in
the
fashion
and
how
you
described
it
in
preserving
order
in
the
penitentiary,
but
i
would
say
this,
if
i
may.
i
think
we
must
always
distinguish
between
desires
and
interests.
and,
i'm
sure
that
the
prison
authorities
desire
that
they
have
a
prison
full
of
docile
unthinking
prisoners
who
don't
cause
any
trouble.
now,
i
would
like
for
my
children
back
here
and
my
students
back
here
not
to
cause
me
any
trouble
and
to
do
just
exactly
what
i
tell
them
to
do.
but,
in
the
long
run,
that
would
not
be
in
my
interest
and
it
would
not
be
in
their
interest,
and
it
would
not
be
in
the
interest
of
the
society
where
they
live.
so,
i
think
we
must
distinguish
these
things.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
it's
a
question
of
absolutely
prohibiting,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
if
it
were,
your
honor,
if
the
state
of
tennessee
had
provided
some
reasonable
alternatives
whereby
these
people
that
i
think
are
being
discriminated
against
could
have
had
access
to
the
court
in
a
realistic
fashion,
then
we
would
not
have
perhaps
had
to
have
this
case
today.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
my
client's
right
derives,
your
honor,
from
these
other
people.
it's
some
--
mr.
karl
p.
warden
no,
he's
also
in
the
solitary
confinement
and
he's
got
to
de
--
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
sir.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
he
claims
only
this,
your
honor,
that
the
state
has
not
provided
an
acceptable
alternative
to
his
providing
help
for
them,
and
that
he's
being
punished
for
doing
that
which
the
state
is
prohibiting.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
your
honor,
then
i
think
he
will
be
in
solitary
confinement
for
having
collecting
money.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
well,
sir,
if
i
understand
your
question,
then
my
answer
is
that
they
would
have
to
have
an
absolute
right
to
put
him
in
solitary
confinement
for
taking
money.
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
about
that.
but,
i
may
as
well
add
this
to
it
too,
that
even
if
this
court
should
find
that
there
is
some
right
to
counsel
at
this
critical
stage
in
the
post
conviction
proceeding
here,
i
think
there
might
still
be
a
constitutional
question
as
to
whether
one
prison
inmate
could
turn
to
a
fellow
inmate
and
say
you
reckon
ought
to
go
to
a
lawyer.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
and
if
that's
sanction,
then
i
think
we're
strictly
on
first
amendment
rights
at
that
point
and
this
rule
would
prohibit
that.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
sir,
he
did.
he
wrote
out
these
petitions
by
hand.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
the
state
here
has
claimed
a
number
of
interests.one
in
prohibiting
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law,
one
in
keeping
good
order
in
the
penitentiaries
and
i've
spoken
of
that
but
i'd
like
to
add
this
one
thing.
there
was
no
showing
in
this
case,
and
there
can't
be
any
showing,
that
there
--
that
the
fact
that
one
prisoner
helps
another
prisoner
articulate
his
claim
to
a
court
necessarily
is
going
to
create
great
disorder
in
a
prison
system.
in
fact,
i
think
it
could
be
argued
that
these
people
who
were
in
the
penitentiary
who
are
inarticulate,
illiterate,
indigent,
who
have
no
way
to
express
these
claims
might
very
well
be
a
greater
source
of
disruption
of
the
prison
discipline
than
one
that
was
allowed
to
go
ahead
and
have
his
case
heard
by
a
court.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
your
honor,
i
am
of
the
opinion
and
impression,
i
should
say,
that
it
is
a
fairly
common
prison
regulation.
i
think
california
has
it
with
the
little
variants
of
the
form.
when
i
was
in
utah
recently,
i
saw
something
in
paper
out
there
that
said
they
have
it.
i
think
new
york
has
it.
there
are
a
number
of
jurisdictions
that
have
it.
i
can't
tell
you
how
many
they
are.
the
state
has
also
claimed
an
interest
here
which
the
prison
authorities
say
fall
on
their
side
of
the
scale
of
balancing
the
interest
and
that
is
in
keeping
the
court
dockets
from
being
clogged.
what
this
rule
prohibits
was
fine
in
equal
impartiality,
the
legitimate
claim,
along
with
the
illegitimate
claim,
and
there
certainly
can't
be
any
kind
of
a
showing
that
a
legitimate
claim
filed
by
an
inmate
who
had
inmate
assistance
clogs
the
court
any
more
than
a
legitimate
claim
filed
by
an
inmate
who
has
a
lawyer
to
help
him
or
by
an
inmate
acting
pro
se.
and,
this
rule
prohibits
all
of
them,
the
legitimate
claims
and
the
illegitimate
claims.
under
the
very
narrow
view,
i
think
narrow,
of
the
state
of
tennessee
and
the
state
of
california,
the
presumed
state
interest
here
in
prohibiting
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law
seems
to
be
served
in
whole
part
by
allowing
people
to
appear
either
pro
se
or
with
attorneys,
and
this
ignores
completely
the
indigent
and
illiterate
incompetent
who
can
neither
act
effectively
nor
can
they
afford
an
attorney.
the
statistics
that
are
provided
by
the
state
of
tennessee
show
that
44%
of
the
people
in
the
tennessee
state
penitentiary
are
of
below
average
intelligence
and
22%
of
the
people
in
the
tennessee
state
penitentiary
are
of
defected
mentalities.
now,
these
people
might
be
able
to
scratch
our
something
on
a
piece
of
paper,
a
lot
of
them
can't
even
do
that,
but
it
just
does
not
seem
realistic
to
me
to
say
that
they
can
act
effectively
pro
se,
that
they
can
call
their
claim
to
the
attention
of
the
court
or
a
lawyer
in
such
a
fashion
that
that
claim
would
be
understood.
and
these
people
are
the
ones
being
discriminated
against.
the
state
of
tennessee
has
provided
no
alternative
means
for
these
people.
the
state
of
california
has
provided
a
series
of
forms
that
these
people
might
use
and
fill
out,
but
the
central
question
on
those
forms
that
these
people
are
to
fill
out
for
themselves
is
really
the
central
question
that
must
be
answered
in
tennessee,
and
that
is
that
this
inmate
must
be
able
to
articulate
why
it
was
that
he
has
been
deprived
of
his
constitutional
right,
just
a
simple
statement
of
the
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights.
well,
i
found
it
a
bit
difficult
to
pen
a
simple
statement
of
a
detriment
of
constitutional
rights
and
i've
had
the
benefit
of
a
legal
education,
and
these
people
matriculated
in
the
streets
and
i
don't
believe
it's
taught
there.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
asked
to
preserve
a
few
moments
of
my
time.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
further
questions
for
me,
i
have
nothing
further
to
add.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
counsel
for
william
joe
johnson
who
is
a
prisoner
in
the
tennessee
state
penitentiary
in
nashville,
tennessee.
as
of
the
time
of
this
argument
today,
william
joe
johnson
has
served
approximately
three
years
in
solitary
confinement
or
in
maximum
security
or
in
a
segregated
environment
within
the
penitentiary.
this
confinement
is
over
and
above
that
confinement
called
for
by
his
sentence,
which
is
a
life
sentence
for
the
crime
of
rape.
the
reason
for
this
extraordinary
confinement
is
because
he
has
violated
one
rule
of
the
tennessee
state
prison
system
is
that
rule
is
here
being
challenged
today,
and
that
rule
is
that
no
inmate
will
advice,
assist,
or
otherwise
contract
to
aid
another
either
with
or
without
a
fee
to
prepare
writs
or
other
legal
matters.
the
united
states
district
court
that
first
heard
this
case
determined
that
his
confinement
was
arbitrary
and
capricious
and
that
it
was
in
violation
of
title
28
united
states
code
annotated
section
2242
and
it
was
in
violation
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court.
our
argument
here
today
seeks
to
have
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
reversed
to
have
further
enforcement
of
this
prison
rule
ended
and
to
have
william
joe
johnson
return
to
the
general
prison
population
and
these
lib
--
these
unnecessary
restraints
on
his
liberties
ended.
now,
the
basis
for
our
argument
is
five-fold.
the
two
major
points
that
we
wish
to
make
are
that,
first
off,
the
state
of
tennessee,
by
enforcing
this
prison
rule
and
by
providing
no
alternative
assistance,
has
effectively
blocked
access
to
the
courts
by
those
prisoners
who
are
indigent
and
inarticulate
or
illiterate,
and
that
to
so
prevent
these
people
from
being
heard
as
a
violation
of
due
process,
a
violation
of
equal
protection,
and
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
freedoms
of
speech
and
right
to
protect,
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances.
and,
our
second
principle
point
is
that
this
prison
regulation
is
not
a
proper
exercise
of
the
state's
limited
power
to
regulate
the
practice
of
law
for
two
reasons.
one,
this
is
not
the
practice
of
law
and,
two,
that
even
if
it
should
be
considered
the
practice
of
law,
it's
beyond
the
power
of
the
strait
--
of
the
state
to
restrict
this
particular
kind
of
practice.
our
further
points
are
that
title
28
section
2242
of
the
united
states
code,
annotated,
reflects
the
ancient
common
law
right
of
one
layman
to
prepare,
sign,
and
verify
petitions
of
habeas
corpus
for
those
who
cannot
help
themselves.
and,
the
final
two
points,
are
that
the
petitioner
does
have
standing
to
raise
these
issues
and
that
was
the
holding
of
both
the
district
and
the
court
of
appeals
and,
finally,
that
this
is
a
proper
case
and
circumstance
for
federal
courts
to
intervene
with
state
prison
management.
and,
apparently,
this
has
been
agreed
to
by
the
state
of
tennessee
in
its
supplemental
brief
provided
that
the
court
finds
that
these
regulations
are
in
violation
of
federal
right.
now,
as
to
our
first
point,
it's
clear
that
a
prisoner
who
can
employ
an
attorney
will
be
fully
and
well-heard
by
whatever
court
he
wishes
to
petition,
but
it's
equally
clear
that
if
this
prisoner
is
indigent,
that
he
only
has
then
four
alternatives.
one
of
these
is
to
be
able
to
talk
some
lawyer
into
representing
him
for
free.
the
second
is
to
proceed
pro
se,
the
third
is
to
get
help
from
someone
untrained
in
law,
and
the
fourth
is
just
to
forget
about
it
all
together
and
let
his
claim
go
by
the
boards.
now,
as
to
the
first
of
these
alternatives,
if
he
can
talk
a
lawyer
into
taking
a
case,
all
of
us
who
practice
law
know
what
happens
to
the
attorney
who
agrees
to
help
one
indigent
prisoner,
he's
immediately
inundated
with
letters
from
not
only
that
prison,
but
from
every
prison
in
the
country
requesting
similar
aid.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
california
has
an
amicus
brief
here,
your
honor.
i
do
not
believe
that
california
provides
counsel
for
indigent
prisoners.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
they
provide
the
assistance
of
prison
guards
and
chaplains,
apparently,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
they
apparently,
yes,
sir.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
your
honor,
although
--
mr.
karl
p.
warden
although,
i
expect
to
argue
a
bit
today
that
these
forms
are
in
fact
not
much
better
than
the
no
assistance
at
all
that
the
state
of
tennessee
provides.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
your
honor,
in
the
event
that
this
attorney
does
receive
these
letters,
what
happens
ultimately
is
that
the
claims
--
the
just
claims
and
the
unjust
claims
are
like
all
going
away
splash
kit.
now,
while
we
ought
to
applaud
an
attorney
who
is
willing
to
help
an
occasional
indigent
prisoner.
we
still
cannot
rely
on
causal
or
whimsical
charity
to
preserve
the
constitutional
guarantees
of
persons
and
fritz
in
the
united
states
and
it's
not
a
sufficient
answer
here
to
say
that
prison
authorities
will
help
these
people.
first
off,
there's
no
showing
that
these
prison
authorities,
the
guards,
chaplains,
clerical
help,
or
any
more
competent
to
provide
assistance
that
is
a
fellow
inmate.
and,
secondly,
it's
clear
that
the
prisoner
knows
full
well
that
the
interest
of
his
keeper
and
his
own
interests
are
not
absolutely
identical.
there
is
and
there
always
will
be
a
real
credibility
gap
between
the
inmate
and
his
keeper,
and
the
prisoner
is
going
to
want
someone
he
can
turn
to,
someone
he
can
talk
to,
someone
he
can
trust,
if
not
his
lawyer,
then
his
friend.
and,
his
friend
is
much
more
likely
to
be
a
fellow
inmate
than
it
is
to
be
his
keeper.
and,
i
think
that
millions
and
millions
of
dollars
that
the
legal
profession
and
the
government
has
spent
in
the
past
few
years
trying
to
bridge
the
communication
gap
between
the
poor
and
the
courts,
the
legal
profession,
by
moving
law
offices
out
in
the
neighborhoods
and
by
allowing
forms
of
lay
intermediary
assistance
all
show
that
this
credibility
gap
here
is
a
very
real
thing
and
ought
to
be
recognized.
and,
finally,
on
that
point
as
on
the
side,
if
it
is
the
practice
of
law
for
an
inmate
to
help
write
petitions,
why
is
it
not
the
practice
of
law
when
it's
done
by
a
prison
guard
or
a
chaplain,
as
apparently
is
done
in
california?
the
activities
of
--
mr.
karl
p.
warden
your
honor,
there
is
not
one
shred
of
evidence
in
this
case
that
my
petitioner
has
charged
anyone
for
his
services.
i
don't
deny
that
prisoners
could
charge.
i
would
deny
that
it
would
be
a
proper
thing
to
do,
of
course.
the
activities
of
the
petitioner
here
are
attacked
as
being
the
practice
of
law
and
it's
said
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
regulate
the
practice
of
law
and
that,
since
petitioner
was
practicing
law,
he
can
be
properly
stopped
by
the
state
prison
authorities.
well,
we
claim
first
that
this
is
not
the
practice
of
law,
that
there
was
no
claim
here
whatsoever
to
represent
these
prisoners
in
court
that
there
was
no
pursuit
of
these
cases
beyond
the
minimal
help
of
helping
them
articulate
what
their
claim
was,
that
he
did
not
stand
and
verify
these
petitions
for
the
inmates,
that
he
returned
these
petitions
to
the
inmates
and
they
signed
them
and
verified
them
themselves
even
if
they
had
to
sign
it
with
an
“x”
as
happened
in
some
instances.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
sir.
i'm
absolutely
certain
that
the
national
bar
association
would
be
concerned.
they're
a
little
bit
fearful
about
me
being
up
here
today,
as
a
matter
of
fact
but
--
mr.
karl
p.
warden
your
honor,
i
think
that
that's
only
one
of
the
points
before
us
today.
i
think
there's
a
very
real
question
here
of
first
amendment
guarantees
and
i
think
that
goes
beyond
the
question
of
--
raised
directly
by
2242.
i
think
that
22
--
mr.
karl
p.
warden
the
district
court
did
that,
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
but
they
also
found
that
this
was
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
act
on
the
part
of
the
federal
prison
authorities,
which
was
a
denial
of
--
as
equal
protection
to
those
persons
who
could
not
articulate
their
own
claim.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
you
would
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
claim.
but,
of
course,
we
had
to
raise
the
constitutional
claim
because
that's
one
facet
to
our
argument.
i
don't'
think
you
have
to
reach
that
in
order
to
decide
this
case
but,
if
i
may
say
so,
sir,
i
think
you
ought
to.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
sir,
you
certainly
would,
in
order
to
adopt
our
view
of
the
case.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
sir,
it
has.
yes,
sir.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
he's
a
state
prisoner,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
i
suppose
so,
your
honor.
all
william
joe
johnson
has
done
in
this
case
is
to
help
these
men
articulate
those
things
that
they
would
have
said
for
themselves
if
they
had
been
able
to
say
them
for
him
--
themselves.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
sir?
mr.
karl
p.
warden
sir
--
mr.
karl
p.
warden
sir,
both
the
federal
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
he
had
standing.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
it's
raised
in
the
california
amicus
brief.
it
was
not
raised
by
the
state
of
tennessee.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
your
honor,
i
will
try
to.
over
and
above
the
question
of
whether
the
two
lower
courts
agreed
that
he
had
standing,
he's
in
solitary
confinement
now
for
the
violation
of
this
rule
and
this
rule
is
the
one
we're
here
challenging
today,
and
in
order
to
challenge
this
rule
today
we
have
to
show
why
it
is
in
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
of
these
indigent
illiterate
prisoners.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
for
almost
three
years.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
he
was
turned
loose
at
the
end
of
the
time
that
the
district
court
decided
this
case,
your
honor,
and
i'm
going
outside
of
the
record,
he
was
put
in
the
day
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
came
down.
now,
there
were
breaks
in
this
total
three-year
period
because
he
would
promise
he
wouldn't
do
it
anymore,
and
they'd
turn
him
loose
and
he'd
do
it
again.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
sir.
he
wasn't
very
trustworthy
about
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
this
man
comes
closer,
your
honor,
to
being
a
modern
day
don
quixote
than
anyone
i
ever
heard
of.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
never
doubted
the
common
law
right
of
one
layman
to
petitioner
or
another
layman
when
the
one
that's
being
held
captive
could
not
speak
for
himself
and
when
the
one
who's
doing
the
petitioning
is
not
an
officious
intermeddler.
at
most,
william
joe
johnson
here
was
a
lay
intermediary.
all
he
ever
did
was
call
the
court's
attention
to
these
men.
he
did
not
solicit
this.
he
did
not
charge.
he
did
not
benefit
in
any
way,
except
the
satisfaction
that
one
human
being
gets
from
helping
another.
but,
even
if
this
court
should
find
that
his
activity
was
the
practice
of
law,
and
we
vigorously
maintain
it
was
not,
still
the
state's
power
to
regulate
stopped
short
of
the
power
to
restrict
unsophisticated
persons
from
seeking
legal
redress
in
the
courts
with
their
claimed
unlawful
imprisonment.
both
federal
and
state
law
provide
a
route
by
which
an
imprisoned
person
can
petition
for
a
release
from
imprisonment.
but,
by
effectively
denying
to
an
identifiable
class
of
persons
the
right
to
use
this
law
here
by
making
the
route
impossible
for
the
indigent,
inarticulate,
and
illiterate,
this
post
conviction
remedy
becomes
illusory.
this
is
not
just
a
deprivation
of
first
amendment
rights,
but
it's
also
then
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
your
honor,
unfortunately,
that's
true.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
no
inmate
would
be
allowed
to,
and
the
rules
--
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
rationale
of
that
case
would
be
entirely
appropriate
here,
although
this
man
was
operating
outside
of
an
environment
where
there
was
a
rule
that
prohibited
any
help
at
all,
and
that's
exactly
what
this
rule
does.
this
rule
does
not
cut
off
help
just
for
illegitimate
claims.
it
cuts
off
help
for
all
claims,
and
that's
the
only
way
it
can
be
viewed
because
these
people
can't
read,
they
can't
write,
and
the
tennessee
statistics
--
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
it
was,
your
honor,
except
that
it's
my
understanding
that
the
man
who
filed
the
petition
for
him
was
not
a
fellow
inmate
but
was
someone
on
the
outside.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
an
interest
of
the
state
here
in
the
fashion
and
how
you
described
it
in
preserving
order
in
the
penitentiary,
but
i
would
say
this,
if
i
may.
i
think
we
must
always
distinguish
between
desires
and
interests.
and,
i'm
sure
that
the
prison
authorities
desire
that
they
have
a
prison
full
of
docile
unthinking
prisoners
who
don't
cause
any
trouble.
now,
i
would
like
for
my
children
back
here
and
my
students
back
here
not
to
cause
me
any
trouble
and
to
do
just
exactly
what
i
tell
them
to
do.
but,
in
the
long
run,
that
would
not
be
in
my
interest
and
it
would
not
be
in
their
interest,
and
it
would
not
be
in
the
interest
of
the
society
where
they
live.
so,
i
think
we
must
distinguish
these
things.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
it's
a
question
of
absolutely
prohibiting,
your
honor.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
if
it
were,
your
honor,
if
the
state
of
tennessee
had
provided
some
reasonable
alternatives
whereby
these
people
that
i
think
are
being
discriminated
against
could
have
had
access
to
the
court
in
a
realistic
fashion,
then
we
would
not
have
perhaps
had
to
have
this
case
today.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
my
client's
right
derives,
your
honor,
from
these
other
people.
it's
some
--
mr.
karl
p.
warden
no,
he's
also
in
the
solitary
confinement
and
he's
got
to
de
--
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
sir.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
he
claims
only
this,
your
honor,
that
the
state
has
not
provided
an
acceptable
alternative
to
his
providing
help
for
them,
and
that
he's
being
punished
for
doing
that
which
the
state
is
prohibiting.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
your
honor,
then
i
think
he
will
be
in
solitary
confinement
for
having
collecting
money.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
well,
sir,
if
i
understand
your
question,
then
my
answer
is
that
they
would
have
to
have
an
absolute
right
to
put
him
in
solitary
confinement
for
taking
money.
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
about
that.
but,
i
may
as
well
add
this
to
it
too,
that
even
if
this
court
should
find
that
there
is
some
right
to
counsel
at
this
critical
stage
in
the
post
conviction
proceeding
here,
i
think
there
might
still
be
a
constitutional
question
as
to
whether
one
prison
inmate
could
turn
to
a
fellow
inmate
and
say
you
reckon
ought
to
go
to
a
lawyer.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
and
if
that's
sanction,
then
i
think
we're
strictly
on
first
amendment
rights
at
that
point
and
this
rule
would
prohibit
that.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
yes,
sir,
he
did.
he
wrote
out
these
petitions
by
hand.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
the
state
here
has
claimed
a
number
of
interests.one
in
prohibiting
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law,
one
in
keeping
good
order
in
the
penitentiaries
and
i've
spoken
of
that
but
i'd
like
to
add
this
one
thing.
there
was
no
showing
in
this
case,
and
there
can't
be
any
showing,
that
there
--
that
the
fact
that
one
prisoner
helps
another
prisoner
articulate
his
claim
to
a
court
necessarily
is
going
to
create
great
disorder
in
a
prison
system.
in
fact,
i
think
it
could
be
argued
that
these
people
who
were
in
the
penitentiary
who
are
inarticulate,
illiterate,
indigent,
who
have
no
way
to
express
these
claims
might
very
well
be
a
greater
source
of
disruption
of
the
prison
discipline
than
one
that
was
allowed
to
go
ahead
and
have
his
case
heard
by
a
court.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
your
honor,
i
am
of
the
opinion
and
impression,
i
should
say,
that
it
is
a
fairly
common
prison
regulation.
i
think
california
has
it
with
the
little
variants
of
the
form.
when
i
was
in
utah
recently,
i
saw
something
in
paper
out
there
that
said
they
have
it.
i
think
new
york
has
it.
there
are
a
number
of
jurisdictions
that
have
it.
i
can't
tell
you
how
many
they
are.
the
state
has
also
claimed
an
interest
here
which
the
prison
authorities
say
fall
on
their
side
of
the
scale
of
balancing
the
interest
and
that
is
in
keeping
the
court
dockets
from
being
clogged.
what
this
rule
prohibits
was
fine
in
equal
impartiality,
the
legitimate
claim,
along
with
the
illegitimate
claim,
and
there
certainly
can't
be
any
kind
of
a
showing
that
a
legitimate
claim
filed
by
an
inmate
who
had
inmate
assistance
clogs
the
court
any
more
than
a
legitimate
claim
filed
by
an
inmate
who
has
a
lawyer
to
help
him
or
by
an
inmate
acting
pro
se.
and,
this
rule
prohibits
all
of
them,
the
legitimate
claims
and
the
illegitimate
claims.
under
the
very
narrow
view,
i
think
narrow,
of
the
state
of
tennessee
and
the
state
of
california,
the
presumed
state
interest
here
in
prohibiting
the
unauthorized
practice
of
law
seems
to
be
served
in
whole
part
by
allowing
people
to
appear
either
pro
se
or
with
attorneys,
and
this
ignores
completely
the
indigent
and
illiterate
incompetent
who
can
neither
act
effectively
nor
can
they
afford
an
attorney.
the
statistics
that
are
provided
by
the
state
of
tennessee
show
that
44%
of
the
people
in
the
tennessee
state
penitentiary
are
of
below
average
intelligence
and
22%
of
the
people
in
the
tennessee
state
penitentiary
are
of
defected
mentalities.
now,
these
people
might
be
able
to
scratch
our
something
on
a
piece
of
paper,
a
lot
of
them
can't
even
do
that,
but
it
just
does
not
seem
realistic
to
me
to
say
that
they
can
act
effectively
pro
se,
that
they
can
call
their
claim
to
the
attention
of
the
court
or
a
lawyer
in
such
a
fashion
that
that
claim
would
be
understood.
and
these
people
are
the
ones
being
discriminated
against.
the
state
of
tennessee
has
provided
no
alternative
means
for
these
people.
the
state
of
california
has
provided
a
series
of
forms
that
these
people
might
use
and
fill
out,
but
the
central
question
on
those
forms
that
these
people
are
to
fill
out
for
themselves
is
really
the
central
question
that
must
be
answered
in
tennessee,
and
that
is
that
this
inmate
must
be
able
to
articulate
why
it
was
that
he
has
been
deprived
of
his
constitutional
right,
just
a
simple
statement
of
the
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights.
well,
i
found
it
a
bit
difficult
to
pen
a
simple
statement
of
a
detriment
of
constitutional
rights
and
i've
had
the
benefit
of
a
legal
education,
and
these
people
matriculated
in
the
streets
and
i
don't
believe
it's
taught
there.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
asked
to
preserve
a
few
moments
of
my
time.
mr.
karl
p.
warden
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
further
questions
for
me,
i
have
nothing
further
to
add.
