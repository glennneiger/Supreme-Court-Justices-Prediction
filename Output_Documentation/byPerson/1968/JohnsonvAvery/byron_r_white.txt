justice

white
mr.
warden,
the
issue
is
now,
as
the
--
what
might
certainly
say
on
section
2242.
particularly,
it's
likely
toward
about
somewhat
--
actually,
what
we
have
is
not
--
does
the
issue
before
us
have
merits?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
we
would
say
“well,
perhaps,
we
can
agree
with
this”
as
a
matter
of
interpretation
that
was
held
in
the
district
court”?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
next
is
we
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you'd
have
to
reach
it
in
the
--
they'd
have
to
reach
it
if
we
didn't
agree
with
the
2242.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
warden,
this
came
up
in
the
form
--
well,
whatever
the
form
that
took
position,
this
has
been
treated
all
along
as
to
the
petition
for
habeas?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
he
a
state
prisoner?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
how
he
gets
2242
into
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
the
crux
of
the
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
those
standings,
that,
i
gather,
reads
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
counsel
had
standing.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
not
challenged
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
doesn't
he
understand
it?
why
can
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long
have
you
been
estoppel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
point.
i
suppose
you
could
very
well
make
a
case
or,
as
an
arguable
case
for
somebody
to
--
for
the
prisoner
to
have
the
right
to
have
some
help
from
some
competent
source
without
being
forced
to,
or
logically
hold
that
a
fellow
inmate
has
a
constitutional
right
to
furnish
it.
i
suppose
you're
up
here
claiming
some
right
on
your
client's
part.
justice
byron
r.
white
solely?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that.
there
certainly
is
a
legitimate
dispute
between
him
and
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
is
he
claiming
some
constitutional
right
himself
to
represent
his
fellow
prisoners?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
would
you
say
if
he
--
if
the
evidence
were
that
he
not
only
represented
prisoners,
but
he
constantly
collected
money
from
them
for
it,
and
the
rule
of
prison
was
you
may
help
other
prisoners
but
you
may
not
collect
money,
and
if
you
do,
you'll
go
to
solitary
confinement?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
there
was
quite
a
dispute
between
him
and
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that
but,
of
course,
that
isn't
what
--
he
did
more
than
advice
going
to
a
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
that's
why
--
so,
you
can
say
as
well
if
that's
what
the
state
was
preventing
him
from
doing.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
we're
familiar
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
from
the
standing
of
the
petitioner
to
assert
somebody
else
to
write
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
actually,
we
held,
i
know
it's
a
little
different,
but
in
the
button
case,
didn't
we,
that
that
organization,
naacp,
could
assert
the
rights
of
others
who
did
not
want
themselves
be
litigants
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
courts
and
we
laid
it
on
first
amendment
grounds.
of
course,
we
didn't
say
they
could
do
the
--
assert
those
rights
of
others
through
non-lawyers
in
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
we
did
say
that
of
course,
there,
we
didn't
have
any
non-lawyer
problem.
we
had
lawyers.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
sort
of
bears
on
this,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
part
of
the
rationale
of
that
case,
as
i
understand,
wasn't
the
great
unlikelihood
that
their
rights
would
ever
be
asserted
otherwise.
justice
byron
