mr.
thomas
e.
fox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
question
of
federal
statute,
i
have
said
in
my
supplemental
brief
that
i
really
don't
think
that
that's
a
serious
question
because,
there,
the
statute
says
that
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
shall
be
in
writing,
signed
and
verified
by
the
person
for
whose
relief
it
is
intended
or
for
someone
acting
in
his
behalf.
i
don't
think
that
goes
any
further
than
the
ministerial
act
of
signing
or
verifying
a
petition
to
be
filed.
i
don't
think
that
contemplated
the
preparation
of
petition.
so,
i
don't
believe
that
that
statute
can
be
relied
upon
as
was
done
by
the
trial
judge,
the
district
judge.
the
court
of
appeals
thought
to
the
contrary
and
i
think,
certainly,
that
that's
too
broad
an
interpretation
for
that
statute.
now,
on
the
question
whether
or
not
this
is
a
practice
of
law,
i
don't
think
that
answers
the
question
because,
certainly,
the
state
of
tennessee
can't
regulate
the
practice
of
law
in
such
a
way
as
to
deny
prison
inmates
aaccess
to
the
court.
so,
i
think
this
is
a
different
situation
really
from
what
it
is
on
the
outside.
i've
tried
to
think,
well,
here
are
inarticulate
people.
you
have
people
who
can't
write
their
names.
you
have
the
same
type
of
people
on
the
outside.
so,
why
wouldn't
the
same
rule
apply?
well,
the
only
difference
i
could
see,
and
i
think
this
is
favorable
to
the
people
inside
the
penitentiary.
they
really
have
more
calls,
i
think,
the
petition
of
course
than
the
people
do
on
the
outside
and
i
think
that
might
--
that's
justification
for
it.
so,
i
think,
certainly,
that
any
rule
that
the
state
of
tennessee
has
that
would
tend
to
deny
these
people
access
to
the
court,
we
don't
contest
that.
we
know
that
that
would
be
in
violation
of
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
under
the
present
procedure,
since
the
adoption
of
our
post
conviction
procedure
act
which
was
adopted
after
this
case
was
started
but
before
it
was
decided
by
the
us
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
cincinnati,
we
provide
a
form
in
the
statute
for
the
--
making
a
petition.
then,
in
one
of
those
sections,
we
provide
that
no
petition
will
be
dismissed
until
an
op
--
free
opportunity
has
been
given
to
freely
amended
with
the
assistance
of
counsel.
so,
i
say,
that
any
man
that
can
say
my
rights
have
been
--
are
being
denied
and
signs
his
name
to
it
and
gets
in
federal
court
or
in
our
state
courts
is
that
broad.
counsel
will
be
appointed
for
him
under
the
statute
and
that
counsel
will
be
given
opportunity
to
amend
it
freely.
then,
if
it
can't
be
amended
so
as
to
make
out
justification
or
allege
a
cause
of
action,
then
it
can
be
dismissed.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
i
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
the
regulation
may
be
a
little
broad
and
it
may
be
susceptible
to
the
construction
that
my
worthy
opponent
has
given
it,
that
is
to
aid
or
assist,
but
i
think
those
words
used
in
context
means
to
act
in
the
capacity
of
giving
legal
advice
not
in
helping
a
man
to
write
out
a
small
or
a
statement
and
makes
--
make
his
mark
or
sign
his
name
to
it.
i
don't
think
that
it
should
be
given
that
broad
interpretation
or
construction.
i
agree
that
it's
possible
and
i
have
learned
that
in
a
statute,
in
a
regulation
that
i
have
ever
experienced
with,
if
the
court
determined
to
give
it
a
non-constitutional
construction,
it
can
be
done.
i
think
that,
i
don't
believe
there's
any
question
about
that.
so,
i
--
but,
i
don't
think
a
fair
construction
would
go
that
far
with
this
one.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
this
is
talking
about
his
punishment,
but
it's
also
a
preventive
measure.
the
man
said
and
his
counsel
said
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
well,
every
--
i
think,
from
the
cases
i've
read,
there's
not
much
evidence
in
the
record
on
it
but
the
f
--
the
director
of
federal
bureau
of
prisons
instructed
the
wardens
at
the
federal
prisons
to
provide
a
writ
writers'
room
and
allow
people
--
and
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
prevent
the
writ
writers
from
having
prisoners
write
petitions.
now,
i
find,
for
meeting
the
cases
that
most
of
the
courts
--
most
of
the
state
courts
in
the
50
jurisdictions
have
had
similar
rules.
now,
here's
what
they
say
about
it.
this
is
what
was
said
about
them
in
one
federal
court.
most
laymen
like
the
ability
and
it
would
be
hardly
necessary
to
include
a
special
provision
of
law
to
authorize
the
employment
of
trained
legal
assistance
in
preparing
papers.
if
the
court
please,
that's
not
the
--
it
just
says
that
it
permits
the
more
aggressive
type
to
take
advantage
of
the
other
prisoners
who
are
not
quite
so
aggressive.
it
says
that
in
some
of
the
cases,
i
believe
that
is
hatfield
versus
bailleaux
from
the
ninth
circuit,
it
just
says
that
even
though
it
said
that
no
co
--
that
no
charge
is
made,
that
it's
almost
impossible
to
find
a
case
where
a
charge
is
not
made,
that
it
might
be
required
in
candy,
it
might
be
required
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no,
sir.
there's
no
evide
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no,
sir.
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
that
effect
and,
so,
we
insist
if
it
gets
back
to
that
then
the
decree
of
the
district
court
is
wrong
because
there's
no
evidence
either
way
on
those
questions,
but
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
i'm
sure
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
i
think
this.
now,
the
regulation
provides
aid
or
assist.
i
don't
say
that
that
goes
to
the
ministerial
functions.
i
think
that
if
i,
in
that
position,
had
a
cause
of
action,
i
don't
know
why
i
couldn't
state
somebody
--
asked
somebody
to
write
it
for
me
and
they'd
perform
nothing
more
than
the
ministerial
act
of
writing
what
i
say
and
then
allow
me
to
make
my
mark.
i
don't
believe
that
that
regulation
ought
to
be
construed
broadly
enough
or
inclusive
enough
to
eliminate
that
type
of
situation.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
that
it
has
today,
as
i
don't
know
it,
unless
judge
miller,
the
district
judge,
put
that
count
--
construction
on
it,
and
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think
if
he
did
that
that
it
really
wasn't
necessary
because,
as
i
said
before,
i
think
we'll
have
to
construe
all
regulations
and
statutes
in
accordance
with
its
context
or
its
environment
and
keep
in
mind
the
thing
that
was
attempted
to
be
permitted.
here's
the
problem.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
think
when
it
gets
beyond
a
ministerial
act,
and
i
mean
by
ministerial
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
well,
under
the
statute,
certainly,
another
inmate
could
sign
it
for
the
prisoner
and
he
could
verify
it.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
under
the
federal
statute,
i'm
speaking
of.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
and
we
don't
deny
that
that
--
that
he
has
that
right.
the
federal
statute
gives
him
that
right.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
and
we
--
that
was
in
existence
when
our
regulation
was
made
and
i
know
that
nobody
in
my
state
would
intend
to
contradict
or
ignore
or
be
in
conflict
with
federal
law
because
we
understand
that.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
well,
i
would
think
that
if
he
could
--
he
might,
even
if
the
man
told
him
what
to
write,
he
could
write
it.
now
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
prisoner
told
the
other
prisoner
what
he
wanted
written,
i
think
he
could
do
that.
i
think
the
regulation
is
subject
to
that
type
of
construction,
but
here
is
the
problem
and
i'm
not
sure
there's
enough
evidence
in
this
record
to
show
what
takes
place,
but
it
was
observed
in
this
hatfield
versus
bailleaux.
the
court
said
“we
observe
from
the
2,255
cases
that
have
been
--
come
before
this
court
that
the
penalties
of
perjury
do
not
deter
the
writ
writer
from
writing
whatever
they
want
to,”
and
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
our
regulation
was
designed
to
get
rid
of.
this
is
outside
the
record
but
the
court
might
know
that,
usually,
those
petitions
are
about
that
thick.
they
cite
--
they're
not
limited
to
what
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
don't
know
whether
it
has
been
up
here
or
not.
you
have
no
report
opinions
on
it,
if
the
court
please.
that's
as
much
as
i
know.
at
least
i
could
find
no
report
opinion
dealing
with
those
things
so
maybe
the
petitions
haven't
gotten
up
to
here.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
well,
i
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
fine,
if
the
court
knows
about
those
things
then
that's
what
we're
trying
to
eliminate.wouldn't
i
assume
that
judge
miller
right
there
in
nashville
gets
quite
a
few
of
them
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir,
he
does.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir,
he
did
that.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
he
suffers
a
lot,
but
--
i
don't
--
i
think
though
that
judges
suffer
just
as
much.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
judge
miller?
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
remember
that
in
his
decision.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir,
but
we
are
here
because
we
say
judge
miller
was
wrong
in
because
the
court
of
appeals
in
cincinnati
said
he
was
wrong.
now,
judge
miller
might
be
right,
but
we're
here
because
we
insist
that
he
was
wrong
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
cincinnati
put
it
on
the
basis
more
so
on
the
practice
of
law.
i
don't
really
accept
that
theory
because
the
court
said
it,
but
i
don't
think
that
quite
gets
to
it
because,
as
i
said
earlier,
it's
--
it
seems
to
me
like
there's
no
question
about
what
is
practice
of
law
but
you
can't
regulate
--
the
state
can't
regulate
the
practice
of
law
in
such
a
way
as
to
prevent
people
to
come
to
court.
i
understand
that.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
one,
that's
one
reason.
the
other
is
that
all
the
prison
officials,
state
and
federal,
that
i've
read
about,
and
i
think
the
cases
that
i've
read
are
nearly
enough
to
include
all
of
them,
they
say
it
underlines
prison
discipline
and
morale
that's
impossible
to
repatriate
or
rehabilitate
prisoners
after
they
come
on
the
influence
of
an
--
of
a
writ
writer
who
is
unscrupulous,
who
is
not
deterred
by
the
penalties
of
perjury,
who
uses
the
people
for
his
own
purposes
rather
than
for
the
purposes
that
the
penitentiary
designed
for,
i
take
it,
to
reform
people
to
themselves,
and
that
rehabilitation
is
impossible
once
the
writ
writers
get
control
of
the
members
of
the
prison.
here's
what
i
look
for
them
to
go
and
this
is
what
one
of
the
courts
had
to
say
about
hatfield
versus
bailleaux.
prison
officials
testified
that
if
permitted
to
engage
in
such
practices,
aggressive
inmates
of
superior
intelligence
exploit
and
dominate
weaker
prisoners
of
inferior
intelligence.
the
practice
also
tends
to
develop
a
group
of
inmate
leaders
which
is
discourage
in
all
institutions.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i'm
--
i'm
reading
from
hatfield
versus
bailleaux.
that's
a
ninth
circuit
case,
if
the
court
please.
i
also
got
that
2,255
cases
from
that
same
case,
the
ninth
circuit
case,
but
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no,
sir.
if
--
insofar
as
the
man's
right
to
petition
to
be
released
from
solitary
confinement.
i
think
it
has
standing,
yes,
sir.
i
don't
--
i
have
not
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir,
they
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
it's
insisted
upon
by
opposing
counsel
that
he
has
--
that
the
writ
writer
has
that
right
because
the
inmate
who
has
the
cause
has
that
right.
he
cited
authority
for
it.
i
thought
--
i
didn't
think
that
sounded
too
unreasonable,
so
i
didn't
question
that.
it
provided,
it's
found
that
it's
necessary
--
that
this
kind
of
help
is
necessary
for
prisoners.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
for
it
to
say
that,
that
one
per
--
inmate
had
a
right
to
assist
another
inmate
who
was
absolutely
without
--
who
was
in
need
of
his
help
beyond
question,
no
question
about
his
need,
it'd
be
unreasonable
to
assume
that
or
to
find
that
the
other
--
the
inmate
who
did
know
how
to
assert
his
right,
that
he
could
go
to
another
person
and
have
that
person
to
assert
it.
i
think
that,
if
i
understand
properly,
they
--
because
of
free
speech
they
insist
they
have
a
right
to
be
at
the
place
together
and
use
it
and
to
disseminate
it.
i
hear
that
argument
in
--
about
the
right
of
the
press
in
the
court
to
take
pictures
and
things
of
that
sort.
they
say
the
public
has
the
right
to
know
and
that
because
that
we
have
a
right
to
get
that
information
and
give
it
to
the
public.
i
thought
that
was
a
similar
sort
of
analogous
thing
and
say
the
least
of
it,
and
i
didn't
contest
it,
maybe
i
should
have.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir,
the
standing
point.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
i
didn't
contest
that.
i
just
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
i
didn't
contest
that,
assuming
that
it
was
not
objectionable
on
the
grounds
of
prison
discipline
and
order
and
rehabilitation
of
prisoners.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
believe
that
that's
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
i
think
that's
a
case
that
was
cited
in
opposing
counsel's
brief
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
for
that
part,
but
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
that's
right.
well,
we
think
now
--
i
noticed
in
stating
the
questions,
i've
stated
a
little
bit
differently
from
mr.
fortas'
question.
he
says
the
right
--
he's
talking
about
the
right
of
inmates
to
help
others
when
there's
no
other
aid
available.
i
just
stated
it
broadly
on
the
question
of
one
inmate
having
a
right
to
aid
another.
if
he
insist
now
that
it
is
not
necessary
and
he
doesn't
have
that
right
when
there's
other
aid
available,
our
position
is
that
our
post
conviction
statute
now
makes
it
awfully
easy
for
any
person
to
get
into
court,
either
federal
or
state
court,
with
his
petition
because
he
gets
his
petition
up
there
and
it's
not
to
be
dismissed
until
an
opportunity
is
given
to
free
the
amended
with
the
aid
of
counsel.
so
then,
he
gets
legal
help.
one
other
question
now
about
the
type
of
punishment
that
was
imposed
upon
the
writ
writer,
i
think
that
it
seized
to
be
punishment
and
it
became
a
necessary
measure
for
this
--
for
prison
discipline
or
for
the
security
of
the
prison.
this
man
said,
and
his
counsel
said
it
at
the
hearing
in
the
federal
district
court,
that
he
expected
to
continue
to
write
writs
without
regard
to
what
the
regulations
were
or
without
regard
to
anything
else,
except
when
another
means
was
provided.
so,
in
order
to
stop
him
not
as
a
matter
of
punishment,
he's
got
to
be
segregated
or
the
prison
officials
have
got
to
spend
their
time
surveilling
the
other
prisoners
to
see
that
they
don't
get
his
help.
so,
it
seems
to
me,
like
it's
a
lot
easier
and
a
lot
more
justifiable
to
put
this
man
in
prison
and
then
spend
the
remainder
of
the
ti
--
or
then
you
--
the
officials
have
got
more
time
to
spend
with
the
other
prisoners,
given
them
the
help
they
need.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
segregate
him
from
the
other
prisoners,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
think
that
means
solitary
confinement,
yes,
sir.
but,
anytime
he
decided
that
he
wouldn't
write
anymore,
he'd
be
released.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir,
but
this
is
a
new
situation
in
the
prison.
this
is
different.
i
think
you
have
to
consider
the
practice
of
law
in
this
situation
different
from
any
other
situation
of
any
--
i
couldn't
find
a
case
that
dealt
with
and
on
these
circumstances.
so,
i
think
it's
a
peculiar
case
and
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
requires
a
peculiar
remedy.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
think
so,
yes,
sir.
i
don't
know
that
i
fully
understand
the
question,
if
there
was
a
lawyer
in
prison
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir,
i
think
so.
i
think
it
applies
to
everybody
there.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
know.
if
a
lawyer
has
committed
a
felony
and
his
in
the
penitentiary,
he
has
proven
he's
untrustworthy,
that
he
can't
be
depended
upon,
i
don't
--
and
he's
not
a
man
of
good
character,
so
i
don't
--
that's
one
of
the
requirements
for
practicing
law.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir,
but
i
think
that
man
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir,
i
think
so.
i
think
that's
generally
the
rule.
i'm
not
really
familiar
with
it,
but
i
do
know
that,
to
be
admitted,
you
have
to
show
evidence
of
good
character
and,
it
seems
to
me,
once
you're
put
in
the
penitentiary
you
don't
--
there's
no
longer
--
the
presumption
has
gone
to
say
the
least
of
it,
that
you
--
not
a
man
of
good
character.
so
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
sir?
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
we
do
in
nashville,
in
davidson
county,
we
do
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
in
memphis.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no,
sir.
this
--
there
are
three
prisons.
one
is
in
nashville.
the
other
one
is
between
nashville
and
memphis.
and
then,
one
in
east
tennessee.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no,
sir.
i've
heard
this
though,
off
the
record,
that
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
i
understand
that
some
of
mr.
warden's
students,
you
can
correct
me
on
this,
it
was
arranged
for
them
to
go
in
and
hear
the
complaints
and
write
the
petitions
for
the
people
who
were
entitled
to
them,
and
they
heard
the
complaints
and
they
didn't
come
up
with
any
petitions.
so,
the
next
time
they
went
out
there,
nobody
came
to
see
them.
they
didn't
have
any
qualms,
and
that's
the
sort
of
thing
that
we're
trying
to
eliminate,
are
these
petitions
that
one
of
the
courts,
and
i
think
it's
in
my
brief,
said
that
the
petitions
were
stereotype.
i
take
it
they
meant
that
each
petition
had
the
same
thing
as
all
the
others
in
it,
and
i
--
it's
evident
that
that's
what
happened.
these
writ
writers,
everything
that
they
know
about
the
law
they'd
put
it
in
the
writ
whether
it's
applicable
to
this
particular
inmate
or
to
s
--
or
not.
then,
the
court
had
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no,
sir,
i
would
say
this
though.
if
he
had
limited
his
petitions
to
the
cases
that
a
lawyer
would
advice
the
petitioner
conscientiously,
that
there'd
never
been
this
kind
of
rule,
you
never
had
any
petition
to
have
had
because
most
of
--
most
the
petitions,
as
indicated
by
the
bailleaux
case,
hatfield
versus
bailleaux,
are
absolutely
that
many,
22
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
understand
there
are
others,
if
the
court
please,
but
i
don't
--
i
think
this
must
be
that
maybe
the
others,
when
they
started
solitary
confinement,
agreed
to
stop
and
did
stop
their
practices.
this
is
home
on
it.
just
as
far
as
i
know,
it's
persistent.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
sorry?
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no,
sir.
it
shows
he's
filed
several
for
himself
and
several
for
other
people.
he
filed
one
for
himself
with,
i
believe
the
record
shows,
with
45
pages
in
it.
he
is
free
to
do
that.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
they
put
on
that
--
they
put
it
all
in.
there's
no
question
about
it.
they
were
all
that
i
know
they
ever
made
to
get
him
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i'm
sure
they're
the
same
thing,
yes,
sir.
i
just
didn't
know
they've
gotten
up
here.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
sorry.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
the
question
of
federal
statute,
i
have
said
in
my
supplemental
brief
that
i
really
don't
think
that
that's
a
serious
question
because,
there,
the
statute
says
that
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
shall
be
in
writing,
signed
and
verified
by
the
person
for
whose
relief
it
is
intended
or
for
someone
acting
in
his
behalf.
i
don't
think
that
goes
any
further
than
the
ministerial
act
of
signing
or
verifying
a
petition
to
be
filed.
i
don't
think
that
contemplated
the
preparation
of
petition.
so,
i
don't
believe
that
that
statute
can
be
relied
upon
as
was
done
by
the
trial
judge,
the
district
judge.
the
court
of
appeals
thought
to
the
contrary
and
i
think,
certainly,
that
that's
too
broad
an
interpretation
for
that
statute.
now,
on
the
question
whether
or
not
this
is
a
practice
of
law,
i
don't
think
that
answers
the
question
because,
certainly,
the
state
of
tennessee
can't
regulate
the
practice
of
law
in
such
a
way
as
to
deny
prison
inmates
aaccess
to
the
court.
so,
i
think
this
is
a
different
situation
really
from
what
it
is
on
the
outside.
i've
tried
to
think,
well,
here
are
inarticulate
people.
you
have
people
who
can't
write
their
names.
you
have
the
same
type
of
people
on
the
outside.
so,
why
wouldn't
the
same
rule
apply?
well,
the
only
difference
i
could
see,
and
i
think
this
is
favorable
to
the
people
inside
the
penitentiary.
they
really
have
more
calls,
i
think,
the
petition
of
course
than
the
people
do
on
the
outside
and
i
think
that
might
--
that's
justification
for
it.
so,
i
think,
certainly,
that
any
rule
that
the
state
of
tennessee
has
that
would
tend
to
deny
these
people
access
to
the
court,
we
don't
contest
that.
we
know
that
that
would
be
in
violation
of
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
under
the
present
procedure,
since
the
adoption
of
our
post
conviction
procedure
act
which
was
adopted
after
this
case
was
started
but
before
it
was
decided
by
the
us
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
cincinnati,
we
provide
a
form
in
the
statute
for
the
--
making
a
petition.
then,
in
one
of
those
sections,
we
provide
that
no
petition
will
be
dismissed
until
an
op
--
free
opportunity
has
been
given
to
freely
amended
with
the
assistance
of
counsel.
so,
i
say,
that
any
man
that
can
say
my
rights
have
been
--
are
being
denied
and
signs
his
name
to
it
and
gets
in
federal
court
or
in
our
state
courts
is
that
broad.
counsel
will
be
appointed
for
him
under
the
statute
and
that
counsel
will
be
given
opportunity
to
amend
it
freely.
then,
if
it
can't
be
amended
so
as
to
make
out
justification
or
allege
a
cause
of
action,
then
it
can
be
dismissed.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
i
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
the
regulation
may
be
a
little
broad
and
it
may
be
susceptible
to
the
construction
that
my
worthy
opponent
has
given
it,
that
is
to
aid
or
assist,
but
i
think
those
words
used
in
context
means
to
act
in
the
capacity
of
giving
legal
advice
not
in
helping
a
man
to
write
out
a
small
or
a
statement
and
makes
--
make
his
mark
or
sign
his
name
to
it.
i
don't
think
that
it
should
be
given
that
broad
interpretation
or
construction.
i
agree
that
it's
possible
and
i
have
learned
that
in
a
statute,
in
a
regulation
that
i
have
ever
experienced
with,
if
the
court
determined
to
give
it
a
non-constitutional
construction,
it
can
be
done.
i
think
that,
i
don't
believe
there's
any
question
about
that.
so,
i
--
but,
i
don't
think
a
fair
construction
would
go
that
far
with
this
one.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
this
is
talking
about
his
punishment,
but
it's
also
a
preventive
measure.
the
man
said
and
his
counsel
said
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
well,
every
--
i
think,
from
the
cases
i've
read,
there's
not
much
evidence
in
the
record
on
it
but
the
f
--
the
director
of
federal
bureau
of
prisons
instructed
the
wardens
at
the
federal
prisons
to
provide
a
writ
writers'
room
and
allow
people
--
and
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
prevent
the
writ
writers
from
having
prisoners
write
petitions.
now,
i
find,
for
meeting
the
cases
that
most
of
the
courts
--
most
of
the
state
courts
in
the
50
jurisdictions
have
had
similar
rules.
now,
here's
what
they
say
about
it.
this
is
what
was
said
about
them
in
one
federal
court.
most
laymen
like
the
ability
and
it
would
be
hardly
necessary
to
include
a
special
provision
of
law
to
authorize
the
employment
of
trained
legal
assistance
in
preparing
papers.
if
the
court
please,
that's
not
the
--
it
just
says
that
it
permits
the
more
aggressive
type
to
take
advantage
of
the
other
prisoners
who
are
not
quite
so
aggressive.
it
says
that
in
some
of
the
cases,
i
believe
that
is
hatfield
versus
bailleaux
from
the
ninth
circuit,
it
just
says
that
even
though
it
said
that
no
co
--
that
no
charge
is
made,
that
it's
almost
impossible
to
find
a
case
where
a
charge
is
not
made,
that
it
might
be
required
in
candy,
it
might
be
required
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no,
sir.
there's
no
evide
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no,
sir.
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
that
effect
and,
so,
we
insist
if
it
gets
back
to
that
then
the
decree
of
the
district
court
is
wrong
because
there's
no
evidence
either
way
on
those
questions,
but
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
i'm
sure
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
i
think
this.
now,
the
regulation
provides
aid
or
assist.
i
don't
say
that
that
goes
to
the
ministerial
functions.
i
think
that
if
i,
in
that
position,
had
a
cause
of
action,
i
don't
know
why
i
couldn't
state
somebody
--
asked
somebody
to
write
it
for
me
and
they'd
perform
nothing
more
than
the
ministerial
act
of
writing
what
i
say
and
then
allow
me
to
make
my
mark.
i
don't
believe
that
that
regulation
ought
to
be
construed
broadly
enough
or
inclusive
enough
to
eliminate
that
type
of
situation.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no,
sir.
i
don't
believe
that
it
has
today,
as
i
don't
know
it,
unless
judge
miller,
the
district
judge,
put
that
count
--
construction
on
it,
and
i
don't
think
that
--
i
think
if
he
did
that
that
it
really
wasn't
necessary
because,
as
i
said
before,
i
think
we'll
have
to
construe
all
regulations
and
statutes
in
accordance
with
its
context
or
its
environment
and
keep
in
mind
the
thing
that
was
attempted
to
be
permitted.
here's
the
problem.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
think
when
it
gets
beyond
a
ministerial
act,
and
i
mean
by
ministerial
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
well,
under
the
statute,
certainly,
another
inmate
could
sign
it
for
the
prisoner
and
he
could
verify
it.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
under
the
federal
statute,
i'm
speaking
of.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
and
we
don't
deny
that
that
--
that
he
has
that
right.
the
federal
statute
gives
him
that
right.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
and
we
--
that
was
in
existence
when
our
regulation
was
made
and
i
know
that
nobody
in
my
state
would
intend
to
contradict
or
ignore
or
be
in
conflict
with
federal
law
because
we
understand
that.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
well,
i
would
think
that
if
he
could
--
he
might,
even
if
the
man
told
him
what
to
write,
he
could
write
it.
now
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
prisoner
told
the
other
prisoner
what
he
wanted
written,
i
think
he
could
do
that.
i
think
the
regulation
is
subject
to
that
type
of
construction,
but
here
is
the
problem
and
i'm
not
sure
there's
enough
evidence
in
this
record
to
show
what
takes
place,
but
it
was
observed
in
this
hatfield
versus
bailleaux.
the
court
said
“we
observe
from
the
2,255
cases
that
have
been
--
come
before
this
court
that
the
penalties
of
perjury
do
not
deter
the
writ
writer
from
writing
whatever
they
want
to,”
and
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
our
regulation
was
designed
to
get
rid
of.
this
is
outside
the
record
but
the
court
might
know
that,
usually,
those
petitions
are
about
that
thick.
they
cite
--
they're
not
limited
to
what
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
don't
know
whether
it
has
been
up
here
or
not.
you
have
no
report
opinions
on
it,
if
the
court
please.
that's
as
much
as
i
know.
at
least
i
could
find
no
report
opinion
dealing
with
those
things
so
maybe
the
petitions
haven't
gotten
up
to
here.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
well,
i
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
fine,
if
the
court
knows
about
those
things
then
that's
what
we're
trying
to
eliminate.wouldn't
i
assume
that
judge
miller
right
there
in
nashville
gets
quite
a
few
of
them
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir,
he
does.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir,
he
did
that.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
he
suffers
a
lot,
but
--
i
don't
--
i
think
though
that
judges
suffer
just
as
much.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
judge
miller?
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
remember
that
in
his
decision.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir,
but
we
are
here
because
we
say
judge
miller
was
wrong
in
because
the
court
of
appeals
in
cincinnati
said
he
was
wrong.
now,
judge
miller
might
be
right,
but
we're
here
because
we
insist
that
he
was
wrong
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
cincinnati
put
it
on
the
basis
more
so
on
the
practice
of
law.
i
don't
really
accept
that
theory
because
the
court
said
it,
but
i
don't
think
that
quite
gets
to
it
because,
as
i
said
earlier,
it's
--
it
seems
to
me
like
there's
no
question
about
what
is
practice
of
law
but
you
can't
regulate
--
the
state
can't
regulate
the
practice
of
law
in
such
a
way
as
to
prevent
people
to
come
to
court.
i
understand
that.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
one,
that's
one
reason.
the
other
is
that
all
the
prison
officials,
state
and
federal,
that
i've
read
about,
and
i
think
the
cases
that
i've
read
are
nearly
enough
to
include
all
of
them,
they
say
it
underlines
prison
discipline
and
morale
that's
impossible
to
repatriate
or
rehabilitate
prisoners
after
they
come
on
the
influence
of
an
--
of
a
writ
writer
who
is
unscrupulous,
who
is
not
deterred
by
the
penalties
of
perjury,
who
uses
the
people
for
his
own
purposes
rather
than
for
the
purposes
that
the
penitentiary
designed
for,
i
take
it,
to
reform
people
to
themselves,
and
that
rehabilitation
is
impossible
once
the
writ
writers
get
control
of
the
members
of
the
prison.
here's
what
i
look
for
them
to
go
and
this
is
what
one
of
the
courts
had
to
say
about
hatfield
versus
bailleaux.
prison
officials
testified
that
if
permitted
to
engage
in
such
practices,
aggressive
inmates
of
superior
intelligence
exploit
and
dominate
weaker
prisoners
of
inferior
intelligence.
the
practice
also
tends
to
develop
a
group
of
inmate
leaders
which
is
discourage
in
all
institutions.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i'm
--
i'm
reading
from
hatfield
versus
bailleaux.
that's
a
ninth
circuit
case,
if
the
court
please.
i
also
got
that
2,255
cases
from
that
same
case,
the
ninth
circuit
case,
but
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no,
sir.
if
--
insofar
as
the
man's
right
to
petition
to
be
released
from
solitary
confinement.
i
think
it
has
standing,
yes,
sir.
i
don't
--
i
have
not
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir,
they
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
it's
insisted
upon
by
opposing
counsel
that
he
has
--
that
the
writ
writer
has
that
right
because
the
inmate
who
has
the
cause
has
that
right.
he
cited
authority
for
it.
i
thought
--
i
didn't
think
that
sounded
too
unreasonable,
so
i
didn't
question
that.
it
provided,
it's
found
that
it's
necessary
--
that
this
kind
of
help
is
necessary
for
prisoners.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
for
it
to
say
that,
that
one
per
--
inmate
had
a
right
to
assist
another
inmate
who
was
absolutely
without
--
who
was
in
need
of
his
help
beyond
question,
no
question
about
his
need,
it'd
be
unreasonable
to
assume
that
or
to
find
that
the
other
--
the
inmate
who
did
know
how
to
assert
his
right,
that
he
could
go
to
another
person
and
have
that
person
to
assert
it.
i
think
that,
if
i
understand
properly,
they
--
because
of
free
speech
they
insist
they
have
a
right
to
be
at
the
place
together
and
use
it
and
to
disseminate
it.
i
hear
that
argument
in
--
about
the
right
of
the
press
in
the
court
to
take
pictures
and
things
of
that
sort.
they
say
the
public
has
the
right
to
know
and
that
because
that
we
have
a
right
to
get
that
information
and
give
it
to
the
public.
i
thought
that
was
a
similar
sort
of
analogous
thing
and
say
the
least
of
it,
and
i
didn't
contest
it,
maybe
i
should
have.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir,
the
standing
point.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
i
didn't
contest
that.
i
just
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
i
didn't
contest
that,
assuming
that
it
was
not
objectionable
on
the
grounds
of
prison
discipline
and
order
and
rehabilitation
of
prisoners.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
believe
that
that's
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
i
think
that's
a
case
that
was
cited
in
opposing
counsel's
brief
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
for
that
part,
but
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
that's
right.
well,
we
think
now
--
i
noticed
in
stating
the
questions,
i've
stated
a
little
bit
differently
from
mr.
fortas'
question.
he
says
the
right
--
he's
talking
about
the
right
of
inmates
to
help
others
when
there's
no
other
aid
available.
i
just
stated
it
broadly
on
the
question
of
one
inmate
having
a
right
to
aid
another.
if
he
insist
now
that
it
is
not
necessary
and
he
doesn't
have
that
right
when
there's
other
aid
available,
our
position
is
that
our
post
conviction
statute
now
makes
it
awfully
easy
for
any
person
to
get
into
court,
either
federal
or
state
court,
with
his
petition
because
he
gets
his
petition
up
there
and
it's
not
to
be
dismissed
until
an
opportunity
is
given
to
free
the
amended
with
the
aid
of
counsel.
so
then,
he
gets
legal
help.
one
other
question
now
about
the
type
of
punishment
that
was
imposed
upon
the
writ
writer,
i
think
that
it
seized
to
be
punishment
and
it
became
a
necessary
measure
for
this
--
for
prison
discipline
or
for
the
security
of
the
prison.
this
man
said,
and
his
counsel
said
it
at
the
hearing
in
the
federal
district
court,
that
he
expected
to
continue
to
write
writs
without
regard
to
what
the
regulations
were
or
without
regard
to
anything
else,
except
when
another
means
was
provided.
so,
in
order
to
stop
him
not
as
a
matter
of
punishment,
he's
got
to
be
segregated
or
the
prison
officials
have
got
to
spend
their
time
surveilling
the
other
prisoners
to
see
that
they
don't
get
his
help.
so,
it
seems
to
me,
like
it's
a
lot
easier
and
a
lot
more
justifiable
to
put
this
man
in
prison
and
then
spend
the
remainder
of
the
ti
--
or
then
you
--
the
officials
have
got
more
time
to
spend
with
the
other
prisoners,
given
them
the
help
they
need.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
segregate
him
from
the
other
prisoners,
if
the
court
please.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
think
that
means
solitary
confinement,
yes,
sir.
but,
anytime
he
decided
that
he
wouldn't
write
anymore,
he'd
be
released.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir,
but
this
is
a
new
situation
in
the
prison.
this
is
different.
i
think
you
have
to
consider
the
practice
of
law
in
this
situation
different
from
any
other
situation
of
any
--
i
couldn't
find
a
case
that
dealt
with
and
on
these
circumstances.
so,
i
think
it's
a
peculiar
case
and
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
requires
a
peculiar
remedy.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
think
so,
yes,
sir.
i
don't
know
that
i
fully
understand
the
question,
if
there
was
a
lawyer
in
prison
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir,
i
think
so.
i
think
it
applies
to
everybody
there.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
don't
know.
if
a
lawyer
has
committed
a
felony
and
his
in
the
penitentiary,
he
has
proven
he's
untrustworthy,
that
he
can't
be
depended
upon,
i
don't
--
and
he's
not
a
man
of
good
character,
so
i
don't
--
that's
one
of
the
requirements
for
practicing
law.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir,
but
i
think
that
man
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir,
i
think
so.
i
think
that's
generally
the
rule.
i'm
not
really
familiar
with
it,
but
i
do
know
that,
to
be
admitted,
you
have
to
show
evidence
of
good
character
and,
it
seems
to
me,
once
you're
put
in
the
penitentiary
you
don't
--
there's
no
longer
--
the
presumption
has
gone
to
say
the
least
of
it,
that
you
--
not
a
man
of
good
character.
so
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
sir?
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
we
do
in
nashville,
in
davidson
county,
we
do
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
in
memphis.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no,
sir.
this
--
there
are
three
prisons.
one
is
in
nashville.
the
other
one
is
between
nashville
and
memphis.
and
then,
one
in
east
tennessee.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no,
sir.
i've
heard
this
though,
off
the
record,
that
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
i
understand
that
some
of
mr.
warden's
students,
you
can
correct
me
on
this,
it
was
arranged
for
them
to
go
in
and
hear
the
complaints
and
write
the
petitions
for
the
people
who
were
entitled
to
them,
and
they
heard
the
complaints
and
they
didn't
come
up
with
any
petitions.
so,
the
next
time
they
went
out
there,
nobody
came
to
see
them.
they
didn't
have
any
qualms,
and
that's
the
sort
of
thing
that
we're
trying
to
eliminate,
are
these
petitions
that
one
of
the
courts,
and
i
think
it's
in
my
brief,
said
that
the
petitions
were
stereotype.
i
take
it
they
meant
that
each
petition
had
the
same
thing
as
all
the
others
in
it,
and
i
--
it's
evident
that
that's
what
happened.
these
writ
writers,
everything
that
they
know
about
the
law
they'd
put
it
in
the
writ
whether
it's
applicable
to
this
particular
inmate
or
to
s
--
or
not.
then,
the
court
had
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no,
sir,
i
would
say
this
though.
if
he
had
limited
his
petitions
to
the
cases
that
a
lawyer
would
advice
the
petitioner
conscientiously,
that
there'd
never
been
this
kind
of
rule,
you
never
had
any
petition
to
have
had
because
most
of
--
most
the
petitions,
as
indicated
by
the
bailleaux
case,
hatfield
versus
bailleaux,
are
absolutely
that
many,
22
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i
understand
there
are
others,
if
the
court
please,
but
i
don't
--
i
think
this
must
be
that
maybe
the
others,
when
they
started
solitary
confinement,
agreed
to
stop
and
did
stop
their
practices.
this
is
home
on
it.
just
as
far
as
i
know,
it's
persistent.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
sorry?
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
no,
sir.
it
shows
he's
filed
several
for
himself
and
several
for
other
people.
he
filed
one
for
himself
with,
i
believe
the
record
shows,
with
45
pages
in
it.
he
is
free
to
do
that.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
yes,
sir.
they
put
on
that
--
they
put
it
all
in.
there's
no
question
about
it.
they
were
all
that
i
know
they
ever
made
to
get
him
--
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
i'm
sure
they're
the
same
thing,
yes,
sir.
i
just
didn't
know
they've
gotten
up
here.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
sorry.
mr.
thomas
e.
fox
thank
you.
