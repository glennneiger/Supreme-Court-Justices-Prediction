justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
to
say
that
at
least
his
presence,
the
officer's
presence
is
not
an
unlawful
presence
inside
the
house,
based
on
the
consent
of
the
wife?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what's
your
position
about
the
arrest?
was
that
a
lawful
arrest
on
that
warrant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
under
state
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
it's
going
to
be
relevant,
isn't
it
to
what
we
have
to
decide
as
to
the
scope
of
the
search,
whether
that
arrest
was
or
was
not
lawful,
whether
on
the
basis
of
the
warrant
or
on
the
basis
of
probable
cause
in
respect
to
the
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
well,
without
making
a
concession,
i
guess
you
are
going
to
argue
on
the
assumption
that
it
was
lawful,
nevertheless
in
scope,
this
exceeded
the
speed
limit
under
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let's
see,
then,
mr.
monroe.
this
gets
down
to
except
for
searches
of
the
persons
--
except
for
searches
of
the
person.
there
has
to
be
both
probable
cause
to
arrest
and
independent
of
the
arrest,
probable
cause
to
search.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
in
addition
to,
rather
than
independent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
all
of
our
cases
so
far,
i
gather,
have
sustained
searches,
so
long
as
there
was
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest
and
that
the
search
was
incident
to
that
arrest,
whether
or
not
the
officers
had
knowledge
of
what
it
was
they
might
pick
up.
that
be
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
suggest
our
cases
support
that
submission?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
has
that
ever
--
has
that
question
ever
been
explicitly
addressed
in
any
of
our
opinions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
get
more
comfort
out
of
the
pre-harris
cases
than
you
do
out
of
the
harris.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
also
says
the
coins
may
be
there.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
large
was
the
house?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
what
decision
do
you
say
we
said
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
we
go
that
far?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
your
submission
is
to
get
a
warrant,
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
specify
every
coin,
hundreds
of
coins?
