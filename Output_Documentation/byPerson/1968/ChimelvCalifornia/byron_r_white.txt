only
--
didn't
they
rule
that
it
was
invalid
under
california
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
arrest
warrant
itself,
on
a
probable
cause
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
going
to
argue,
aren't
you,
that
there
should
be
no
arrest
without
a
warrant
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
concede
that
you
may
arrest
without
a
warrant,
constitutionally?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
i
agree
with
that.
i
just
wondered
what
your
contention
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
my
primary
focus,
your
honor,
is
on
the
search
itself.
i
also
take
a
second
position
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
a
valid
warrant
should
have
been
used.
however,
my
primary
focus
is
on
the
search
itself.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
these
the
--
were
these
the
fruit
of
another
burglary?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
police
know
it
at
the
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
they
--
they
never
even
knew
of
the
other
robbery
or
burglary?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
doesn't
know
what
was
stolen
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
if
he
had
known
specifically
what
was
stolen
in
the
pulati
case
and
he
encountered
it
in
the
house
that
he
searched,
in
the
course
of
searching
for
coins
stolen
in
another
burglary,
would
you
say
he
couldn't
seize
the
fruit
of
the
pulati?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
this
is
--
this
is
your
fundamental
question,
the
legality
of
the
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
either
a
valid
arrest
warrant
or
without
a
valid
search
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
if
--
well,
what
more
do
you
need
--
what
more
do
you
suggest
we
need
if
you
have
probable
cause,
or
a
warrant
to
arrest
a
fellow
for
stealing
some
coins,
and
you
go
to
his
house
and
arrest
him
in
his
house?
now
you
suggest
you
need
more
reason
to
search
his
house
for
the
coins
than
the
fact
that
you
think
he
stole
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
have
some
reason
to
believe
that
he
has
not
only
stolen
them
but
that
he
has
actually
got
them
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it,
then,
that
your
position
certainly
would
be
that
if
the
officer
went
to
the
magistrate
and
said,
“i
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
so-and-so
stole
some
coins,”
and
if
the
magistrate
agreed
with
him
that
he
had
probable
cause
he
nevertheless
couldn't
automatically
also
get
a
search
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
couldn't
say
to
the
magistrate,
“well,
you
agree
with
me
that
i
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
john
jones
stole
these
coins,
and
you
are
giving
me
the
arrest
warrant
for
his
arrest;
therefore,
give
me
a
search
warrant
for
his
house.”
you
would
say
he
would
have
to
have
more
than
that
to
get
a
search
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
describes
the
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
says
the
coins
that
were
stolen
here,
the
description
of
the
coins.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
because
the
man
stole
them,
and
that's
where
he
lives.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
would
you
agree
there
was
a
sufficient
showing?
if
there
was
--
if
you
agreed
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
and
you
agreed
that
the
arrest
warrant,
validly
issued,
would
you
agree
there
was
then
probable
cause
to
issue
the
search
warrant
to
search
his
house
where
he
lived?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
more
must
he
show?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
he
stashed
the
coins
there
instead
of
someplace
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
he
couldn't
get
one
anyway,
if
he
went
after
it,
because
he
had
absolutely
no
probable
cause
to
think
the
coins
were
in
the
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
officers
ought
to
leave.
their
just
aren't
going
to
get
to
search
ever.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
for
the
fun
of
it.
he
wasn't
looking
for
coins
as
the
product
of
the
crime
for
which
he
was
arresting
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
suggest
that
everything
he
seized
at
that
time
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
might
have
been
stolen
from
the
money
vault?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
was
a
single
trial
for
both
burglaries?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
your
submission
as
to
why
an
officer,
when
he
arrests
someone
in
his
house,
should
be
able
to
search
any
more
broadly
than
the
person
of
the
defendant,
to
search
for
weapons
or
something
like
that,
to
guarantee
the
officer's
own
safety,
or
to
just
seize
what
is
in
plain
sight?
what's
your
basis
for
saying
that
he
should
be
able
to
search
for
the
fruits
of
a
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
anywhere
in
the
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
what's
your
submission
then?
you
should
be
able
to
search
for
the
fruits
of
the
crime
anywhere
in
the
locality
where
you
arrest
the
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
should
you
be
able
to
search
for
the
fruits
of
the
crime,
though,
without
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
couldn't
you
get
a
warrant
and
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
know
what
the
fruits
of
the
crime
are,
why
don't
you
come
armed
with
a
warrant
for
a
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
was
searching
for,
or
if
he
had
had
a
warrant
for
certain
coins,
he
might
have
been
able
to
search
anywhere
in
the
house
for
those
coins?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
he
encountered
some
other
coins
that
he
recognized
as
having
been
stolen
from
somewhere
else,
he
could
have
seized
them
anyway,
couldn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
other
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
still
haven't
really
gotten
around
to
saying
why
you
think
that
an
officer
should
be
able
to
search
a
house
without
a
warrant
for
the
fruits
of
a
crime
and
you
said
that
it
would
be
a
lot
of
trouble.
so
far
you
said
that
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
realistically,
though,
do
you
think
officers
under
our
cases
would
get
a
search
warrant
when
our
cases
aren't
here
to
hold
that
if
you
make
a
valid
arrest
on
probable
cause,
you
may
search
incident
to
an
arrest?
officers
don't
ordinarily
come
armed
with
--
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
it
would
have
been
very
easy,
very
easy,
to
get
the
search
warrant,
automatic,
five
minutes.
justice
byron
r.
white
officers
often
don't
ordinarily
come
armed
with
both
search
and
arrest
warrant,
do
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
said
ordinarily.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
without
the
arrest,
this
search
could
not
have
been
made.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
difference,
then,
would
the
state
suggest
it
makes
in
terms
of
the
permissibility
of
this
search?
what
difference
does
it
make
that
the
arrest
took
place?
i
know
you
can
say,
“well,
the
cases
hold
that,”
but
those
cases
are
under
attack
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
wonder
why
you
think
the
arrest,
just
the
fact
of
arresting
a
man
in
his
house,
gives
the
officers
the
right
to
make
a
search
of
the
bedroom
that
otherwise
they
would
not
have
had
in
the
absence
of
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
you
had
arrested
him
down
at
his
office
and
made
that
basic
invasion
of
privacy,
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
go
and
search
the
house
without
a
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
couldn't
go
and
search
his
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
you
arrest
him
in
his
house
or
in
his
office
as
to
whether
or
not
you
can
search
his
house
without
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
can
say
that
they
have
a
right
to
search
for
the
fruits
of
a
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
anywhere
in
the
house
that
fruits
of
that
sort
might
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
your
submission.
justice
byron
r.
white
drawer
for
a
television
set.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
they
could
have
looked
anywhere
in
the
house
that
coins
might
have
been
hidden.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
surprised
that
you
don't
suggest
that
once
you
arrest
a
man
in
his
house,
confederates,
family,
and
everyone
else
is
alerted
--
are
alerted
and
that
it
might
be
essential,
if
the
officers
have
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest,
and
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
has
the
fruits,
or
that
they
are
somewhere,
that
there
is
some
kind
of
urgency
about
looking
for
them,
for
the
fruits,
before
they
are
made
off
with.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn't
get
to
why
they
didn't
a
warrant
in
the
first
place,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
actually
negotiated
at
the
police
station.
justice
byron
r.
white
before
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
assume
there
are
many
more
--
we
may
assume,
i
suppose,
that
there
were
many,
many
more
searches
than
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
searches.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
only
--
didn't
they
rule
that
it
was
invalid
under
california
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
arrest
warrant
itself,
on
a
probable
cause
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
going
to
argue,
aren't
you,
that
there
should
be
no
arrest
without
a
warrant
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
concede
that
you
may
arrest
without
a

constitutionally?
justice
byron

white
oh!
i
agree
with
that.
i
just
wondered
what
your
contention
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
my
primary
focus,
your
honor,
is
on
the
search
itself.
i
also
take
a
second
position
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
a
valid
warrant
should
have
been
used.
however,
my
primary
focus
is
on
the
search
itself.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
these
the
--
were
these
the
fruit
of
another
burglary?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
police
know
it
at
the
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
they
--
they
never
even
knew
of
the
other
robbery
or
burglary?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
doesn't
know
what
was
stolen
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
if
he
had
known
specifically
what
was
stolen
in
the
pulati
case
and
he
encountered
it
in
the
house
that
he
searched,
in
the
course
of
searching
for
coins
stolen
in
another
burglary,
would
you
say
he
couldn't
seize
the

justice
byron

white
so
this
is
--
this
is
your
fundamental
question,
the
legality
of
the
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
either
a
valid
arrest
warrant
or
without
a
valid
search
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
if
--
well,
what
more
do
you
need
--
what
more
do
you
suggest
we
need
if
you
have
probable
cause,
or
a
warrant
to
arrest
a
fellow
for
stealing
some
coins,
and
you
go
to
his
house
and
arrest
him
in
his
house?
now
you
suggest
you
need
more
reason
to
search
his
house
for
the
coins
than
the
fact
that
you
think
he
stole
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
have
some
reason
to
believe
that
he
has
not
only
stolen
them
but
that
he
has
actually
got
them
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it,
then,
that
your
position
certainly
would
be
that
if
the
officer
went
to
the
magistrate
and
said,
“i
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
so-and-so
stole
some
coins,”
and
if
the
magistrate
agreed
with
him
that
he
had
probable
cause
he
nevertheless
couldn't
automatically
also
get
a
search
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
couldn't
say
to
the
magistrate,
“well,
you
agree
with
me
that
i
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
john
jones
stole
these
coins,
and
you
are
giving
me
the
arrest
warrant
for
his
arrest;
therefore,
give
me
a
search
warrant
for
his
house.”
you
would
say
he
would
have
to
have
more
than
that
to
get
a
search
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
describes
the
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
says
the
coins
that
were
stolen
here,
the
description
of
the
coins.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
because
the
man
stole
them,
and
that's
where
he
lives.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
would
you
agree
there
was
a
sufficient
showing?
if
there
was
--
if
you
agreed
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
and
you
agreed
that
the
arrest
warrant,
validly
issued,
would
you
agree
there
was
then
probable
cause
to
issue
the
search
warrant
to
search
his
house
where
he
lived?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
more
must
he
show?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
he
stashed
the
coins
there
instead
of
someplace
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
he
couldn't
get
one
anyway,
if
he
went
after
it,
because
he
had
absolutely
no
probable
cause
to
think
the
coins
were
in
the
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
officers
ought
to
leave.
their
just
aren't
going
to
get
to
search
ever.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
for
the
fun
of
it.
he
wasn't
looking
for
coins
as
the
product
of
the
crime
for
which
he
was
arresting
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
suggest
that
everything
he
seized
at
that
time
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
might
have
been
stolen
from
the
money
vault?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
was
a
single
trial
for
both
burglaries?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
your
submission
as
to
why
an
officer,
when
he
arrests
someone
in
his
house,
should
be
able
to
search
any
more
broadly
than
the
person
of
the
defendant,
to
search
for
weapons
or
something
like
that,
to
guarantee
the
officer's
own
safety,
or
to
just
seize
what
is
in
plain
sight?
what's
your
basis
for
saying
that
he
should
be
able
to
search
for
the
fruits
of
a
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
anywhere
in
the
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
what's
your
submission
then?
you
should
be
able
to
search
for
the
fruits
of
the
crime
anywhere
in
the
locality
where
you
arrest
the
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
should
you
be
able
to
search
for
the
fruits
of
the
crime,
though,
without
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
couldn't
you
get
a
warrant
and
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
know
what
the
fruits
of
the
crime
are,
why
don't
you
come
armed
with
a
warrant
for
a
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
he
was
searching
for,
or
if
he
had
had
a
warrant
for
certain
coins,
he
might
have
been
able
to
search
anywhere
in
the
house
for
those
coins?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
he
encountered
some
other
coins
that
he
recognized
as
having
been
stolen
from
somewhere
else,
he
could
have

you
still
haven't
really
gotten
around
to
saying
why
you
think
that
an
officer
should
be
able
to
search
a
house
without
a
warrant
for
the
fruits
of
a
crime
and
you
said
that
it
would
be
a
lot
of
trouble.
so
far
you
said
that
much.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
realistically,
though,
do
you
think
officers
under
our
cases
would
get
a
search
warrant
when
our
cases
aren't
here
to
hold
that
if
you
make
a
valid
arrest
on
probable
cause,
you
may
search
incident
to
an
arrest?
officers
don't
ordinarily
come
armed
with
--
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
it
would
have
been
very
easy,
very
easy,
to
get
the
search
warrant,
automatic,
five
minutes.
justice
byron
r.
white
officers
often
don't
ordinarily
come
armed
with
both
search
and
arrest
warrant,
do
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
said
ordinarily.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
without
the
arrest,
this
search
could
not
have
been
made.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
difference,
then,
would
the
state
suggest
it
makes
in
terms
of
the
permissibility
of
this
search?
what
difference
does
it
make
that
the
arrest
took
place?
i
know
you
can
say,
“well,
the
cases
hold
that,”
but
those
cases
are
under
attack
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
wonder
why
you
think
the
arrest,
just
the
fact
of
arresting
a
man
in
his
house,
gives
the
officers
the
right
to
make
a
search
of
the
bedroom
that
otherwise
they
would
not
have
had
in
the
absence
of
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
you
had
arrested
him
down
at
his
office
and
made
that
basic
invasion
of
privacy,
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
go
and
search
the
house
without
a
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
couldn't
go
and
search
his
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
you
arrest
him
in
his
house
or
in
his
office
as
to
whether
or
not
you
can
search
his
house
without
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
can
say
that
they
have
a
right
to
search
for
the
fruits
of
a
crime.
justice
byron
r.
white
anywhere
in
the
house
that
fruits
of
that
sort
might
be.
justice
byron

that
is
your
submission.

but
you
think
they
could
have
looked
anywhere
in
the
house
that
coins
might
have
been
hidden.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
surprised
that
you
don't
suggest
that
once
you
arrest
a
man
in
his
house,
confederates,
family,
and
everyone
else
is
alerted
--
are
alerted
and
that
it
might
be
essential,
if
the
officers
have
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest,
and
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
has
the
fruits,
or
that
they
are
somewhere,
that
there
is
some
kind
of
urgency
about
looking
for
them,
for
the
fruits,
before
they
are
made
off
with.
justice
byron
r.

but
it
doesn't
get
to
why
they
didn't
a
warrant
in
the
first
place,
does
it?

we
assume
there
are

more

we
may
assume,
i
suppose,
that
there
were
many,
many
more
searches
than
that.
justice

no,

yes.
