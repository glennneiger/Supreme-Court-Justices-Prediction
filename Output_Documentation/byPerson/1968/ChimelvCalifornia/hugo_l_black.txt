justice

l.
black
well,
you
would
have
a
hard
time
getting
a
remedy
if
that
is
all
you
had,
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.
you
might
have
a
civil
action
or
something,
but
you
would
have
a
hard
time
arguing
that
an
otherwise
valid
conviction
had
to
fall
because
the
arrest
was
an
improper
one.
we
have
never
held
anything
like
that,
have
we?

the

mr.
george,
i
wanted
to
ask
you
one
question.
you
might
not
have
time
to
do
it
between
now
and
12:00.
it's
about
a
minute
and
a
half.
you
said
many
times
that
they
had
probable
cause
to
believe
he
was
guilty
and
that
justified
an
arrest?
justice
hugo
l.

could
you
state
briefly
what
evidence
there
was
that
they
had?
justice

was
this
a
pawnshop?
justice
hugo
l.

a
coin
shop.
justice

he
negotiated
for
the
return
of
the
