really,
the
essence
of
your
position
is
that
you
want
us
to
re-examine
rabinowitz
and
harris,
and
that
is
a
perfectly
understandable
position.
justice
john
m.
harlan
did
they
search
the
house
before
mr.
chimel
came
back?
justice
john
m.
harlan
they
waited
for
him.
they
went
to
the
house,
found
he
wasn't
there,
wanted
to
arrest
him,
and
they
waited
for
him.
justice
john
m.
harlan
and
they
arrested
him,
and
then
the
search
followed
that,
is
that
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
you
don't
say
that,
do
you?
justice
john
m.
harlan
do
you
have
any
idea
of
the
comparable
figures
in
other
states?
justice
john
m.
harlan
in
the
federal
system
itself?
justice
john
m.
harlan
well,
of
course,
the
development
of
this
whole
field,
like
so
many
areas
of
the
law,
hasn't
been
strictly
logical.
if
you
take
the
first
philosophy,
or
what
you
call
the
harris
philosophy,
through
its
logical
conclusion
and
say
that
all
the
fourth
amendment
requires
is
reasonableness
under
the
circumstances,
i
would
suppose,
as
a
matter
of
logic,
it
would
follow
that
if
a
policeman
gets
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
the
man
at
his
house
and
then
finds
he
doesn't
happen
to
be
there,
and
he
gets
lawful
access
to
the
house
because
of
his
warrant,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
see
why
logically
he
wouldn't
be
reasonable.
that's
the
only
test.
he
could
go
ahead
and
search
the
house
anyway.
this
whole
train
of
development
hasn't
been
a
matter
of
pure
logic
by
any
manner
or
means,
has
it?
justice
john
m.
harlan
i
am
suggesting
that
that
is
so.
i
am
suggesting
that
the
law,
if
it
remains
perfectly
stable,
you
can't
search
without
a
warrant
except
in
very
limited
circumstances,
one
of
which
is
incident
to
an
arrest
and,
therefore,
it's
not
quite
accurate
to
say
that
there
are
two
opposite
philosophies
as
regards
the
interpretation
of
the
fourth
amendment
as
a
whole,
namely,
reasonable
or
logically,
a
warrant
in
every
case
where
you
can
get
one
feasibly.
justice
