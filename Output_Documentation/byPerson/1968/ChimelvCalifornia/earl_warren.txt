mr.
monroe.
chief
justice
earl
warren
isn't
this
case
somewhat
confusing
because
there
were
two
burglaries
involving
coins,
and
the
police
officer
went
there
with
probable
cause
to
arrest
for
one
of
them.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
had
no
knowledge
of
the
other
one,
and
he
made
a
general
search
of
the
whole
house,
and
found
nothing
in
connection
with
the
burglary
on
which
they
had
probably
cause,
but
found
some
things
on
the
other
burglary
for
which
they
had
no
probable
cause
when
they
went
there,
and
had
no
information.
chief
justice
earl
warren
this
is
something
like
the
facts
in
mapp,
where
they
went
looking,
i
think,
for
gambling
apparatus,
or
something
of
that
kind,
and
they
made
a
general
search
and
ended
up
finding
some
obscene
literature
in
a
trunk
in
the
place.
that
would
be
somewhat
comparable
to
this,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes
but
mr.
monroe,
we
have
taken
all
your
time
by
answering
questions,
and
i
think
we
would
like
to
hear
something
about
rabinowitz
and
harris,
because
that
is
the
thrust
of
your
case,
and
i
suggest
that
you
may
have
five
minutes
for
rebuttal,
if
you
want,
after
hearing
from
the
other
side,
if
you
would
want.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and,
of
course,
you
may
have
five
minutes
extra
if
you
wish
it,
too.
mr.
george.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
far
could
they
go
on
the
searching
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
just
gave
us?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
george,
may
i
ask
you
this.
is
your
desire
to
broaden
out
the
right
of
search,
does
that
indicate
a
desire
on
the
part
of
law
enforcement
in
california
to
wipe
out
the
necessity
of
warrants,
search
warrants,
warrants
of
every
kind,
in
order
to
go
in
and
search
whenever
they
want
to
do
so?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'll
tell
you
the
reason
i
ask
that.
it's
because
in
one
case
we
had
here
a
while
back,
it
was
stated
to
us
that
in
the
great
city
of
los
angeles,
there
were
--
the
police
department
got
out,
i
think
it
was,
fewer
than
20
search
warrants
in
an
entire
year.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
widespread
is
the
practice
of
getting
search
warrants
in
los
angeles?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
prevalent
are
they,
let's
say,
in
the
city
of
los
angeles?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
figures
that
we
have
for
the
central
district
of
los
angeles,
and
some
of
the
neighboring
judicial
districts
--
this
is
not
the
whole
county
--
is
225
search
warrants
issued
last
year.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
includes
territory
outside
of
los
angeles?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
the
los
angeles
police
have
nothing
to
do
with
those?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
how
many
in
the
city
of
los
angeles?
chief
justice
earl
warren
most
of
them,
you
say.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
george,
was
he
tried
for
both
burglaries?
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
convicted
of
both.
chief
justice
earl
warren
although
there
was
no
identification
of
the
coins
from
the
second
or
the
burglary
on
which
they
had
had
probable
cause?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
george,
if
they
couldn't
differentiate
at
the
police
station,
or
at
the
court
when
they're
getting
a
warrant
of
arrest,
what
coins
they're
interested
in,
how
did
they
differentiate
when
they
were
in
the
house
as
to
what
coins
they
would
take
and
what
ones
the
would
leave.
chief
justice
earl
warren
couldn't
he
have
given
that
to
the
judge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
couldn't
he
have
given
that
to
the
judge?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
because
he
didn't
think
that
was
sufficient
information
that
he
had,
he
thought
he
couldn't
get
a
search
warrant,
so
he
thought
he
would
do
it
without
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
george,
may
i
ask
you
this
one.
when
you
and
i
were
discussing
the
number
of
search
warrants,
i
thought
you
indicated
that
at
some
place
in
the
record
here
there
were
some
figures
on
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
told
me
something
like
200
in
the
central
district
of
los
angeles
and
so
forth.
you
don't
have
any
figures
like
that
in?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
there
be
any
objection,
counsel,
to
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well
we
--
i'd
like
to
have
them.
just
might
not
be
relevant,
but
it
would
be
interesting
anyway.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
please.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well
he
did
claim,
though,
that
he
had
bought
these
things,
did
he
not?
he
didn't
admit
to
any
burglarizing.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
claimed
that
he
had
bought
these
from
somebody,
fictitious
or
otherwise.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
we
we'll
recess
now.
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
you
may
have
one
minute.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
monroe.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you'll
submit
that
to
us
too,
will
you
please,
mr.
monroe.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
alright.
