justice
abe
fortas
the
california
court
so
held,
didn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
then
--
so
we
now
have
a
ruling
of
the
state
courts
that
this
warrant
is
invalid.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
don't
understand
your
position
in
view
of
what
you
said.
i
thought
that
you
were
arguing
to
this
court
that
the
arrest
was
an
unlawful
arrest,
in
these
particular
circumstances.
and
that,
second,
even
if
the
arrest
was
lawful,
which
you
say
it
was
not,
the
search
was
of
an
impermissible
scope.
now,
is
that
your
position
or
is
it
not?
that
is
what
i
thought
was
indicated
by
your
petition
for
cert,
and
by
your
brief
here?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that,
but
i
am
trying
to
find
out,
following
my
brother
brennan's
question
to
you,
whether
secondarily,
or
however
--
whatever
order
you
want
to
do
it,
you
challenge
the
lawfulness
of
the
arrest
here.
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
you
did,
but
if
you
don't,
i'd
certainly
like
to
know.
as
i
read
your
papers,
you
certainly
challenged
the
lawfulness
of
the
arrest
here
on
the
theory
that,
as
the
california
courts
held,
the
warrant
was
invalid,
that
without
the
warrant
the
arrest
here
was
unlawful
and
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
abe
fortas
and
you
would
not
challenge
that
arrest
on
the
grounds
that
he
should
have
obtained
a
warrant?
justice
abe
fortas
because
you
say
there
was.
is
it
your
position
that
whenever
the
police
have
probable
cause
to
arrest,
regardless
of
the
time
factor
or
any
other
circumstances,
they
don't
have
to
get
a
warrant?
is
that
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don't
understand
that
at
all.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
but
involved
in
this,
as
i
understand
it,
one
of
the
arguments
that
the
state
makes
is
that
the
search
and
the
seizure
were
lawful
as
incident
to
a
valid
arrest.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
do
you
or
do
you
not
argue
that
the
arrest
was
invalid
as
one
branch
of
your
submission
to
this
court?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
no.
i'm
not
asking
you
to
concede
anything.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
your
position
is.
i
have
read
your
petition
and
your
brief
here,
and
you
surprised
me
by
what
you
said.
but
if
that's
your
position,
then
that's
your
position.
justice
abe
fortas
in
what
basis
did
the
california
court
hold
that
the
warrant
was
invalid?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
well
do
you
--
what
about
the
second
point
that
you
listed
there?
why
do
we
have
to
consider
that,
the
delay
of
six
hours
in
executing
a
warrant?
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
involved
in
this
case?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean,
assuming
that
the
warrant
was
otherwise
valid,
petitioner
argues
that
its
effect
was
spent,
or
it
was
invalid
or
ineffective
because
of
the
delay.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
the
point?
justice
abe
fortas
i
take
it
that
your
point
is
that
the
arrest
here
was
valid
because
there
was
probable
cause,
and
that
the
--
and
that
no
warrant
was
necessary.
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
case
that
you
can
think
of
in
which
a
warrant
is
necessary
and
can
be
lawfully
obtained
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
doesn't
this
position
really
read
out
of
existence
--
read
out
of
existence
--
the
need
for
a
warrant?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
talking
--
let's
take
the
arrest
warrant.
first,
is
there
any
case
where
an
arrest
warrant
could
be
obtained
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
would
be
necessary
on
the
theory
in
which
this
case
is
being
argued
by
you,
and
i
expect
by
your
adversary?
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
police
never
need
a
warrant.
if
they
have
probable
cause,
they
can
get
a
warrant,
of
course,
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment
but
they
don't
need
it,
because
if
they
have
probable
cause,
they
can
go
ahead
and
arrest.
justice
abe
fortas
and
so
all
this
business
of
going
to
a
magistrate
to
get
a
warrant
in
the
terms
of
the
warrant
is
wasted
time.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know.
well,
maybe
it's
a
nice
thing
for
officers
to
do,
but
no
legal
requirement.
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
now,
second,
turning
to
the
search
warrant,
your
position
is
exactly
the
same,
isn't
it,
that
is
to
say
that,
wherever
there
is
probable
cause
to
search,
there
is
no
need
to
obtain
the
warrant?
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
other
hand,
if
there's
not
probable
cause,
the
warrant
cannot
be
obtained.
justice
abe
fortas
can
you
suggest
a
situation
to
me
in
which
there
is
probable
cause
for
arrest
and
not
probable
cause
to
search?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
there
may
be
a
difference
in
the
permissible
scope
of
the
search,
but
that
whenever
there
is
probable
cause
to
arrest,
there
is
probable
cause
to
conduct
some
sort
of
search.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
abe
fortas
i
know,
but
if
he
had
gotten
a
search
warrant
here,
the
search
warrant
would
have
specified
only
the
fruits
of
the
first
robbery,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
because
that's
all
this
policeman
had
any
cause
to
suspect
was
connected
with
chimel,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now
by
not
getting
a
search
warrant
--
just
a
moment
--
by
not
getting
a
search
warrant,
on
your
submission
the
police
officer
was
able
to
make
a
broader
search
than
he
would
have
been
able
to
make
if
he
had
gotten
a
search
warrant.
am
i
right
or
wrong
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
but
what
you're
saying
then
is
the
officer
has
more
latitude
and
lawfully
has
more
latitude
if
he
does
not
get
a
warrant
than
if
he
does
get
a
warrant.
justice
abe
fortas
the
california
court
so
held,
didn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
but
then
--
so
we
now
have
a
ruling
of
the
state
courts
that
this
warrant
is
