mr.
keith
c.
monroe
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
considers
today
a
case
which,
i
believe
goes
to
the
very
core
of
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
the
facts
of
the
case,
in
february
1965,
there
was
a
burglary
of
the
pulati
home
in
santa
ana,
california.
number
of
coins
were
taken,
some
metals
and
tokens,
containers
and
so
forth.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
rare
coins.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
collector's
items,
your
honor,
yes.
thereafter,
in
august
of
1965,
there
was
a
burglary
of
a
coin
shop,
the
money
vault.
this
took
place
in
orange,
california
nearby.
without
going
into
a
great
deal
of
detail,
there
was
suspicion
of
the
petitioner
as
to
the
pulati
burglary
but
i
think
it
was
pretty
much
agreed
and
appears
in
the
record,
that
way,
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
on
which
his
arrest
could
have
been
founded.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
also
prior
to
that
time,
he
had
talked
to
them
about
insurance
whether
or
not
the
coins
were
insured.
he
knew,
of
course,
as
a
fellow
member
of
coin
clubs
that
they
were
coin
collectors
and
that
they
did
have
coins
in
their
home.
as
to
the
money
vault
burglary,
the
petitioner
made
a
statement
before
the
burglary
to
a
neighbor
that
he
had
a
big
deal
cooking
that
night
and
that
he
was
going
to
knock
over.
i
don't
know
whether
he
said
coin
shop
exactly.
he
was
going
to
knock
over
a
place,
anyhow.
thereafter,
to
the
same
neighbor
he
made
a
statement
the
day
following
the
burglary
that
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
enter,
which
had
been
unsuccessful.
and
some
two
weeks
later
he
made
another
statement
to
another
coin
shop
operator
that
he
had
been
involved
in
the
money
vault
matter.
now,
then,
this
was
about
the
middle
of
august.
on
august
25th,
the
california
supreme
court
found
that
petitioner
was
arrested
without
a
warrant,
on
the
street,
in
santa
ana,
california,
by
the
investigating
officer
here,
officer
del
coma.
after
transportation
to
the
orange
police
station
and
some
interrogation,
petitioner
was
released.
then
on
september
13th,
something
more
than
two
weeks
later,
officer
del
coma
went
to
the
appropriate
magistrate
and
submitted
a
complaint
in
purely
conclusionary
form.
the
complaint
is
set
out
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
on
the
basis
of
this
complaint
which,
in
substance,
merely
said,
“i
believe
that
this
man
committed
a
burglary
on
such
and
such
a
date
in
this
county”;
on
the
basis
of
this
complaint,
a
warrant
of
arrest
issued
at
10:39
a.m.
on
september
13th.
officer
del
coma
doesn't
give
us
too
clear
a
picture
of
what
he
did
the
rest
of
that
day.
he
knew
where
the
petitioner
was
at
that
time.
he
knew
where
he
worked.
he
knew
where
to
go
and
get
him.
but
in
any
case,
officer
del
coma
arrived
at
the
petitioner's
home
something
shortly
after
4:00
p.m.,
knowing
at
that
time
that
he
was
not
home.
he
gained
admittance
to
the
house,
waited
for
him
to
come
home.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
his
wife
was
there,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
the
record
simply
shows
that
the
officer
requested
admittance
to
wait
for
mr.
chimel,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
don't
think
this
record
is
clear
enough
to
show
one
way
or
the
other,
your
honor.
we
don't
contend
that
the
officer's
presence
was
unlawful
at
that
point.
mr.
chimel
came
home
at
something
like
4:30
p.m.,
whereupon
the
officer,
after
he
had
entered
the
house,
placed
him
under
arrest
on
the
authority
of
the
warrant,
showed
him
the
warrant,
requested
permission
to
search,
which
was
not
granted.
the
officer
then
stated
that,
having
executed
a
lawful
arrest
on
a
felony
warrant,
he
had
a
right
to
search,
and
he
was
going
to,
and
proceeded
to
do
so.
this
search
covered
every
room
in
the
house.
it
covered
the
garage.
it
covered
an
inspection
in
the
attic
and
it
involved
the
opening
of
drawers,
the
opening
of
boxes,
cupboards.
it
was
described
by
the
officer
as
a
general
search.
the
officer
did
not
have
knowledge,
at
the
time
he
made
this
search
of
any
--
of
information
which
led
him
to
believe
that
any
specific
property
was
to
be
found
in
that
house.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
can't
answer
this
simply
yes
or
no,
your
honor,
for
the
reason
that
in
this
case
we
raised
the
issue,
so
far
as
i
know
for
the
first
time
in
california,
that
the
arrest
warrant
had
been
unlawfully
issued.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
under
federal
law,
giordenello
versus
u.s.
and
aguilar
that
--
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
the
california
court
did
so
hold,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
no,
your
honor.
it
was
under
giordenello,
aguilar,
and
barnes.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
cases
from
this
court.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
this
brings
us
then
to
the
alternative
holding
of
the
california
court
that
it
was
a
valid
probable
cause
arrest.
if
i
may
leave
that
point
for
a
moment,
it
ties
in
with
a
later
part
of
the
argument.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
a
little
bit
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
in
that.
i
don't
want
to
concede
the
arrest
was
lawful,
because
i
have
doubts.
i
think
that
the
search
was
bad
for
other
reasons.
i
simply
don't
want
to
make
the
concession.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
intend
to
make
that
argument.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
oh!
certainly,
i
am
sure
that
there
are
myriad
of
cases
where
an
arrest
without
warrant
should
be
valid.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
if
i
can
clarify,
your
honor,
to
back
up
and
change
the
facts
a
little
bit,
if
the
officer
had
simply
put
the
petitioner
under
arrest
at
his
home,
and
taken
him
down
to
the
station,
had
that
been
all
that
had
gone
on,
i
would
not
challenge
that
arrest
on
probable
cause.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
no.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that
is
not
my
position,
your
honor,
but
so
far
as
the
arrest
which
involves
no
search,
i
don't
think
that
it
is
fairly
before
this
court
on
this
record.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
for
the
sake
of
argument,
your
honor,
i'll
concede
that
this
arrest
was
invalid,
for
the
sake
of
argument
here.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
pursuing
the
facts
of
the
case,
then,
after
this
search,
or
going
back
to
this
search
of
september
13.
it
was
based
altogether
on
a
charge
of
burglary
of
the
money
vault.
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
the
only
thing
which
was
missing
from
the
money
vault
was
coins,
nothing
else.
nevertheless,
in
this
search,
a
large
quantity
of
coins
and
medals,
tokens,
boxes,
razor
blades,
containers,
various
other
non-coin
items
were
seized.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
this
was
what
later
developed,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
no.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
the
record
indicates
that
officer
del
coma,
who
is
the
central
figure
here,
had
heard
something
of
the
pulati
burglary,
the
first
burglary,
but
that
--
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
think
he
knew
there
were
coins
which
had
been
taken,
but
he
did
not
have
any
detailed
information
so
far
as
the
record
shows.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
oh,
no.
if,
your
honor,
he
were
in
the
course
of
a
legal
search,
i
think
under
marron
he
would
have
a
right
to
seize
contraband
or
stolen
goods
which
he
happened
to
come
across
in
the
course
of
a
legal
search,
although
i
don't
think
this
was
a
legal
search
at
all
here.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
plus
on
additional
point.
i
suggest
that
in
order
to
make
a
search
as
an
incident
to
an
arrest,
there
should
be
a
showing
of
the
same
elements
of
probable
cause
thereafter
which
would
have
justified
issuance
of
a
search
warrant
in
the
first
place,
else,
you
are
proceeding
with
a
search
which
is
not
justified
by
as
much
showing,
you
are
proceeding
without
a
warrant
with
less
showing
than
you
would
be
had
you
proceeded
with
a
warrant,
the
preferred
method
of
procedure.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
no
quarrel.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
oh!
certainly
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
searches
of
the
person,
i
think,
stand
on
an
altogether
different
plane,
because
the
officer
arresting
a
person
obviously
has
a
primary
need
to
search
that
man
and
see
that
he
is
not
assaulted
with
some
sort
of
weapon.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
there.
there's
an
obvious
necessity.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
say
really
that
it's
independent
of
the
probable
cause
to
arrest.
rather,
turning
to
--
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
there
has
to
be
that
other
element
of
some
reason
to
think,
if
i,
as
the
officer,
am
going
to
search
the
place
of
arrest,
then
i
have
to
have
some
reason
to
think
--
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
think
there's
a
strong
suggestion
in
the
cases,
your
honor.
the
cases
which
have
sustained
searches
that
this
court
in
fact
has
over
the
years
sustained
those
searches
which
have
proceeded
in
this
context
with
a
valid
arrest
warrant
and
a
very
strong
suggestion
that
the
officer
did
have
knowledge
that,
what
i
want
at
least
has
a
likelihood
of
being
there.
it
becomes
almost
impossible
to
explain
the
exploratory
search
cases
unless
there
is
something
of
that
nature.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
no.
the
cases
in
this
court
--
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
the
harris
case
is
not
comforting
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
no.
rabinowitz,
i
think,
is
squarely
an
issue,
so
far
as
its
language,
the
warrant
is
not
required.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
don't
think
it
would
be
necessary.
let
me
clarify
my
position
here,
too,
because,
of
course,
when
one
suggests
a
re-examination
of
rabinowitz,
the
mind
automatically
turns
to
the
revival
of
trupiano.
i'm
not
really
suggesting
this,
because
i
think
trupiano
was
a
very
difficult
case
on
its
own
facts.
trupiano,
it
may
be
recalled,
involved
a
valid
arrest
of
antonio,
who
was
then
committing
a
felony,
and
the
still,
the
paraphernalia
for
committing
the
felony
was
in
plain
view.
i
think
possibly
trupiano
went
too
far
in
not
permitting
the
still
to
come
into
evidence.
there
was,
after
all,
a
valid
probable
cause
arrest,
and
this
still
was
seen
in
the
course
of
making
that
arrest.
trupiano
raised
some,
i
think,
very
definite
problems
there.
in
terms
of
results,
the
cases
in
this
court
which
have
generally
been
supported
--
it
might
be
noted
here,
too,
that
rabinowitz
so
often
cited
as
a
non-warrant
case,
was
a
case,
in
fact,
in
which
there
was
a
valid
arrest
warrant
and
there
was
every
reason
to
think
the
very
property
for
which
the
search
was
made
was
in
the
place
which
was
searched.
every
element
which
would
have
been
necessary
to
get
a
search
warrant
was
known
to
the
officer
and
was
almost
unquestionably
present.
the
other
cases
which
have
supported
similar
searches
are
united
states
versus
ventresca,
rugendorf,
jones
versus
the
united
states
362
u.s.,
abel
versus
u.s.
362,
of
course
rabinowitz
which
was
with
a
warrant,
u.s.
versus
lefkowitz,
and
marron
versus
u.s.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
don't
--
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
certainly,
your
honor,
because
he
would
have
to
particularly
describe
for
the
magistrate
the
place
to
be
searched
and
the
persons
or
things
to
be
seized.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
but
the
person
or
things
to
be
seized.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
but
i
think
under
the
camara,
he
would
have
to
give
some
reason
for
thinking
that
they
were
there.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
if
this
were
before
a
magistrate,
and
the
magistrate
passed
on
it
and
felt
that
there
was
a
sufficient
showing,
taking
all
of
the
facts
in
such
and
such
--
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
the
cause
shown
is
merely
enough
to
arrest,
if
that
is
the
cause
shown,
i
do
not
think
that
is
enough
to
search
his
house.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
some
reason
for
thinking
that
--
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
if
the
officer
assumed
that
they
were
in
his
possession?
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
on
the
--
let
me
turn
to
the
facts
in
this
case
--
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
oh!
certainly.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
there
has
to
be
something
other
than
an
unfounded
assumption,
certainly.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
or
he
had
conducted
himself
in
such
a
manner
as
to
support
belief
that
they
are
there.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
think
there
can
be
no
question,
your
honor,
about
the
validity
--
let
me
separate,
first
of
all,
searches
and
seizures.
many
of
the
cases
treat
them
as
one
and
the
same.
i
think
there
can
be
no
question
about
seizure
of
evidence,
instrumentalities,
contraband,
in
plain
view.
searches
of
the
person,
of
course,
are
conceded.
as
far
as
searches
beyond
that,
it
is
very,
very
hard,
i
think,
to
find
a
logical
stopping
point,
because
we
start
with
rabinowitz,
which
permitted
a
very
narrowly
circumscribed
search
of
one
room.
now,
we
are
searching
entire
houses.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
sir?
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
oh!
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
only
logical
line
that
can
be
drawn
is
the
person,
and
those
things
which
are
in
plain
view
of
the
person
at
the
place
of
arrest.
when
it
involves
going
into
containers,
so
to
speak,
then
i
think
the
legitimate
scope
of
the
search
has
been
exceeded.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
in
looking
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
were
three
officers.
it
would
have
been
a
very
simple
thing,
if
they
wanted
to
do
so,
to
leave
one
officer
there
and
obtain
a
search
warrant.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
true,
your
honor,
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
the
officer
describes
this
as
a
general
search.
he
wasn't
searching
for
anything
specific,
so
it
seems
to
me
clear
on
his
testimony
that
he
was
exploring
this
house.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
questioned
him
on
that
and
he
didn't
so
testify.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that
is
true,
your
honor.
this
is
a
hard
point
here,
and
i
think
it
bears
emphasis
that
the
case
on
which
they
had
probable
cause
was
coins
and
coins
alone,
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
and
the
seizure
was
of
medals,
tokens,
boxes,
wallets,
razor
blades,
things
which
weren't
even
in
the
same
class.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
it
is,
your
honor,
yes.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
thank
you.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
none
i
also
have
some
figures.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
no,
he
did
not
admit.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
thank
you,
your
honor.
to
pursue
this
same
point
a
little
bit
on
the
matter
of
warrants,
i
have
shortly
before
coming
here
contacted
the
clerk
of
the
municipal
court
in
los
angeles
judicial
district,
who
is
one
of
the
few
agencies
in
california,
or
anywhere,
so
far
as
i
can
find
out,
who
has
some
statistical
information
available
on
search
warrants.
to
give
you
an
idea
of
what
los
angeles
judicial
district
comprises,
the
entire
county
is
authorized
125
municipal
court
judges.
los
angeles
judicial
district,
which
is
within
that
county,
comprises
58
of
those
125
judges.
so
we
have
something
here
which
is
approaching
half
of
the
entire
county.
in
1931,
according
to
the
letters
i
have,
the
clerk
of
this
court
commenced
keeping
separate
records
of
search
warrants
issued
and
papers
received
for
search
warrants.
they
were
numbered
serially,
commencing
with
the
number
1.
as
of
march
12,
1969,
these
numbers
had
reached
1938
or,
in
other
words,
during
this
period
of
time,
there
had
been
approximately
some
50
warrants
per
year,
or
something
like
that,
although
this
is
not
a
fair
representation,
since
in
1968.
according
to
advice
i
have
personally
received
from
the
clerk,
there
were
papers
processed
in
this
judicial
district
for
179
search
warrants.
so
the
figure
has
gone
up,
but
it
was
to
me
amazingly
low
for
a
38-year
period.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
yes,
i
will.
the
1968
figures
i
obtained
myself.
the
letter
covers
the
rest.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
looked
and
i
was
unable
--
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
do
not
know.
turning
to
rabinowitz,
i
think
it
is
necessary
to
look
to
the
fourth
amendment
itself.
i
think
we
can
see
rather
clearly
two
distinct
philosophies
in
interpretation
of
the
amendment.
rabinowitz
and
harris,
in
that
line
of
cases,
say
not
in
so
many
words,
but
in
terms
of
results
they
say,
the
fourth
amendment
consists
of
two
clauses,
one
which
prohibits
unreasonable
searches,
and
the
other
clause
sets
forth
the
procedure
for
obtaining
warrants.
the
opposing
line
of
cases
is,
of
course,
trupiano,
taylor
versus
u.s.,
and
those
similar
cases
which
say
this
is
not
true,
rather,
there
is
a
general
requirement
in
the
amendment
which
points
to
the
use
of
warrants
and
with
or
without
a
warrant,
any
search
which
is
unreasonable
does
not
comply
with
the
amendment
itself.
the
question
which
troubles
me
greatly
in
the
rabinowitz-harris
philosophy
is
that
if
the
unreasonable
search
clause
can
stand
by
itself,
and
if
there
is
not
some
requirement
somewhere
for
the
use
of
warrants
as
a
general
rule,
but
if
unreasonable
searches
covers
the
ground,
then
we've
violated
a
cardinal
principle
of
statutory
construction,
because
the
unreasonable
search
clause
really
covers
the
substance
of
what's
in
the
warrant
clause.
it's
not
necessary
to
have
the
warrant
language
there.
and
on
that
basis,
i
would
submit
that
there
must
be
something
more
to
the
amendment
which
suggests
that
under
some
conditions
a
warrant
is
required.
the
facts
in
this
case,
i
think
illustrate
with
the
search
of
a
home,
with
very
ample
time,
in
fact
conceded
no
exigent
circumstances,
grave
question
about
cause
for
searching.
if
this
case
doesn't
require
a
search
warrant,
i
ask
what
case
possibly
could,
and
if
there
is
not
a
case
that
possibly
could
require
a
warrant,
then
the
fourth
amendment
itself
is
changed.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
thus,
along
that
line
of
thought,
your
honor,
that
then,
would
cast
doubt
on
chapman.
it
would
cast
doubt
on
taylor.
it
would
cast
doubt
on
all
of
the
cases
where
there
has
been
a
search
and
not
even
an
arrest.
they
can't
all
be
wrong,
can
they?
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
my
purpose
in
addressing
myself
to
this,
your
honor,
was
that
if
the
reasonable
clause
is
to
be
given
primary
meaning,
then
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
real,
strong
reason
for
having
the
warrant
clause
in
the
amendment
at
all.
for
certainly
a
warrant
which
was
issued
without
oath
or
affirmation,
or
without
probable
cause,
would
not,
on
its
face,
be
reasonable.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
think
the
amendment
must
be
read
as
a
whole,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
considers
today
a
case
which,
i
believe
goes
to
the
very
core
of
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
the
facts
of
the
case,
in
february
1965,
there
was
a
burglary
of
the
pulati
home
in
santa
ana,
california.
number
of
coins
were
taken,
some
metals
and
tokens,
containers
and
so
forth.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
rare
coins.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
collector's
items,
your
honor,
yes.
thereafter,
in
august
of
1965,
there
was
a
burglary
of
a
coin
shop,
the
money
vault.
this
took
place
in
orange,
california
nearby.
without
going
into
a
great
deal
of
detail,
there
was
suspicion
of
the
petitioner
as
to
the
pulati
burglary
but
i
think
it
was
pretty
much
agreed
and
appears
in
the
record,
that
way,
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
on
which
his
arrest
could
have
been
founded.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
also
prior
to
that
time,
he
had
talked
to
them
about
insurance
whether
or
not
the
coins
were
insured.
he
knew,
of
course,
as
a
fellow
member
of
coin
clubs
that
they
were
coin
collectors
and
that
they
did
have
coins
in
their
home.
as
to
the
money
vault
burglary,
the
petitioner
made
a
statement
before
the
burglary
to
a
neighbor
that
he
had
a
big
deal
cooking
that
night
and
that
he
was
going
to
knock
over.
i
don't
know
whether
he
said
coin
shop
exactly.
he
was
going
to
knock
over
a
place,
anyhow.
thereafter,
to
the
same
neighbor
he
made
a
statement
the
day
following
the
burglary
that
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
enter,
which
had
been
unsuccessful.
and
some
two
weeks
later
he
made
another
statement
to
another
coin
shop
operator
that
he
had
been
involved
in
the
money
vault
matter.
now,
then,
this
was
about
the
middle
of
august.
on
august
25th,
the
california
supreme
court
found
that
petitioner
was
arrested
without
a
warrant,
on
the
street,
in
santa
ana,
california,
by
the
investigating
officer
here,
officer
del
coma.
after
transportation
to
the
orange
police
station
and
some
interrogation,
petitioner
was
released.
then
on
september
13th,
something
more
than
two
weeks
later,
officer
del
coma
went
to
the
appropriate
magistrate
and
submitted
a
complaint
in
purely
conclusionary
form.
the
complaint
is
set
out
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
on
the
basis
of
this
complaint
which,
in
substance,
merely
said,
“i
believe
that
this
man
committed
a
burglary
on
such
and
such
a
date
in
this
county”;
on
the
basis
of
this
complaint,
a
warrant
of
arrest
issued
at
10:39
a.m.
on
september
13th.
officer
del
coma
doesn't
give
us
too
clear
a
picture
of
what
he
did
the
rest
of
that
day.
he
knew
where
the
petitioner
was
at
that
time.
he
knew
where
he
worked.
he
knew
where
to
go
and
get
him.
but
in
any
case,
officer
del
coma
arrived
at
the
petitioner's
home
something
shortly
after
4:00
p.m.,
knowing
at
that
time
that
he
was
not
home.
he
gained
admittance
to
the
house,
waited
for
him
to
come
home.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
his
wife
was
there,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
the
record
simply
shows
that
the
officer
requested
admittance
to
wait
for
mr.
chimel,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
don't
think
this
record
is
clear
enough
to
show
one
way
or
the
other,
your
honor.
we
don't
contend
that
the
officer's
presence
was
unlawful
at
that
point.
mr.
chimel
came
home
at
something
like
4:30
p.m.,
whereupon
the
officer,
after
he
had
entered
the
house,
placed
him
under
arrest
on
the
authority
of
the
warrant,
showed
him
the
warrant,
requested
permission
to
search,
which
was
not
granted.
the
officer
then
stated
that,
having
executed
a
lawful
arrest
on
a
felony
warrant,
he
had
a
right
to
search,
and
he
was
going
to,
and
proceeded
to
do
so.
this
search
covered
every
room
in
the
house.
it
covered
the
garage.
it
covered
an
inspection
in
the
attic
and
it
involved
the
opening
of
drawers,
the
opening
of
boxes,
cupboards.
it
was
described
by
the
officer
as
a
general
search.
the
officer
did
not
have
knowledge,
at
the
time
he
made
this
search
of
any
--
of
information
which
led
him
to
believe
that
any
specific
property
was
to
be
found
in
that
house.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
can't
answer
this
simply
yes
or
no,
your
honor,
for
the
reason
that
in
this
case
we
raised
the
issue,
so
far
as
i
know
for
the
first
time
in
california,
that
the
arrest
warrant
had
been
unlawfully
issued.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
under
federal
law,
giordenello
versus
u.s.
and
aguilar
that
--
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
the
california
court
did
so
hold,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
no,
your
honor.
it
was
under
giordenello,
aguilar,
and
barnes.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
cases
from
this
court.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
this
brings
us
then
to
the
alternative
holding
of
the
california
court
that
it
was
a
valid
probable
cause
arrest.
if
i
may
leave
that
point
for
a
moment,
it
ties
in
with
a
later
part
of
the
argument.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
yes,
your
honor.
i
am
a
little
bit
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma
in
that.
i
don't
want
to
concede
the
arrest
was
lawful,
because
i
have
doubts.
i
think
that
the
search
was
bad
for
other
reasons.
i
simply
don't
want
to
make
the
concession.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
this
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
intend
to
make
that
argument.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
oh!
certainly,
i
am
sure
that
there
are
myriad
of
cases
where
an
arrest
without
warrant
should
be
valid.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
if
i
can
clarify,
your
honor,
to
back
up
and
change
the
facts
a
little
bit,
if
the
officer
had
simply
put
the
petitioner
under
arrest
at
his
home,
and
taken
him
down
to
the
station,
had
that
been
all
that
had
gone
on,
i
would
not
challenge
that
arrest
on
probable
cause.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
no.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that
is
not
my
position,
your
honor,
but
so
far
as
the
arrest
which
involves
no
search,
i
don't
think
that
it
is
fairly
before
this
court
on
this
record.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
for
the
sake
of
argument,
your
honor,
i'll
concede
that
this
arrest
was
invalid,
for
the
sake
of
argument
here.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
pursuing
the
facts
of
the
case,
then,
after
this
search,
or
going
back
to
this
search
of
september
13.
it
was
based
altogether
on
a
charge
of
burglary
of
the
money
vault.
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
the
only
thing
which
was
missing
from
the
money
vault
was
coins,
nothing
else.
nevertheless,
in
this
search,
a
large
quantity
of
coins
and
medals,
tokens,
boxes,
razor
blades,
containers,
various
other
non-coin
items
were
seized.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
this
was
what
later
developed,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
no.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
the
record
indicates
that
officer
del
coma,
who
is
the
central
figure
here,
had
heard
something
of
the
pulati
burglary,
the
first
burglary,
but
that
--
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
think
he
knew
there
were
coins
which
had
been
taken,
but
he
did
not
have
any
detailed
information
so
far
as
the
record
shows.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
oh,
no.
if,
your
honor,
he
were
in
the
course
of
a
legal
search,
i
think
under
marron
he
would
have
a
right
to
seize
contraband
or
stolen
goods
which
he
happened
to
come
across
in
the
course
of
a
legal
search,
although
i
don't
think
this
was
a
legal
search
at
all
here.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
plus
on
additional
point.
i
suggest
that
in
order
to
make
a
search
as
an
incident
to
an
arrest,
there
should
be
a
showing
of
the
same
elements
of
probable
cause
thereafter
which
would
have
justified
issuance
of
a
search
warrant
in
the
first
place,
else,
you
are
proceeding
with
a
search
which
is
not
justified
by
as
much
showing,
you
are
proceeding
without
a
warrant
with
less
showing
than
you
would
be
had
you
proceeded
with
a
warrant,
the
preferred
method
of
procedure.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
no
quarrel.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
oh!
certainly
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
searches
of
the
person,
i
think,
stand
on
an
altogether
different
plane,
because
the
officer
arresting
a
person
obviously
has
a
primary
need
to
search
that
man
and
see
that
he
is
not
assaulted
with
some
sort
of
weapon.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
there.
there's
an
obvious
necessity.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
if
i
may,
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
say
really
that
it's
independent
of
the
probable
cause
to
arrest.
rather,
turning
to
--
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
there
has
to
be
that
other
element
of
some
reason
to
think,
if
i,
as
the
officer,
am
going
to
search
the
place
of
arrest,
then
i
have
to
have
some
reason
to
think
--
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
think
there's
a
strong
suggestion
in
the
cases,
your
honor.
the
cases
which
have
sustained
searches
that
this
court
in
fact
has
over
the
years
sustained
those
searches
which
have
proceeded
in
this
context
with
a
valid
arrest
warrant
and
a
very
strong
suggestion
that
the
officer
did
have
knowledge
that,
what
i
want
at
least
has
a
likelihood
of
being
there.
it
becomes
almost
impossible
to
explain
the
exploratory
search
cases
unless
there
is
something
of
that
nature.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
no.
the
cases
in
this
court
--
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
the
harris
case
is
not
comforting
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
no.
rabinowitz,
i
think,
is
squarely
an
issue,
so
far
as
its
language,
the
warrant
is
not
required.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
don't
think
it
would
be
necessary.
let
me
clarify
my
position
here,
too,
because,
of
course,
when
one
suggests
a
re-examination
of
rabinowitz,
the
mind
automatically
turns
to
the
revival
of
trupiano.
i'm
not
really
suggesting
this,
because
i
think
trupiano
was
a
very
difficult
case
on
its
own
facts.
trupiano,
it
may
be
recalled,
involved
a
valid
arrest
of
antonio,
who
was
then
committing
a
felony,
and
the
still,
the
paraphernalia
for
committing
the
felony
was
in
plain
view.
i
think
possibly
trupiano
went
too
far
in
not
permitting
the
still
to
come
into
evidence.
there
was,
after
all,
a
valid
probable
cause
arrest,
and
this
still
was
seen
in
the
course
of
making
that
arrest.
trupiano
raised
some,
i
think,
very
definite
problems
there.
in
terms
of
results,
the
cases
in
this
court
which
have
generally
been
supported
--
it
might
be
noted
here,
too,
that
rabinowitz
so
often
cited
as
a
non-warrant
case,
was
a
case,
in
fact,
in
which
there
was
a
valid
arrest
warrant
and
there
was
every
reason
to
think
the
very
property
for
which
the
search
was
made
was
in
the
place
which
was
searched.
every
element
which
would
have
been
necessary
to
get
a
search
warrant
was
known
to
the
officer
and
was
almost
unquestionably
present.
the
other
cases
which
have
supported
similar
searches
are
united
states
versus
ventresca,
rugendorf,
jones
versus
the
united
states
362
u.s.,
abel
versus
u.s.
362,
of
course
rabinowitz
which
was
with
a
warrant,
u.s.
versus
lefkowitz,
and
marron
versus
u.s.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
don't
--
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
certainly,
your
honor,
because
he
would
have
to
particularly
describe
for
the
magistrate
the
place
to
be
searched
and
the
persons
or
things
to
be
seized.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
but
the
person
or
things
to
be
seized.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
but
i
think
under
the
camara,
he
would
have
to
give
some
reason
for
thinking
that
they
were
there.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
if
this
were
before
a
magistrate,
and
the
magistrate
passed
on
it
and
felt
that
there
was
a
sufficient
showing,
taking
all
of
the
facts
in
such
and
such
--
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
the
cause
shown
is
merely
enough
to
arrest,
if
that
is
the
cause
shown,
i
do
not
think
that
is
enough
to
search
his
house.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
some
reason
for
thinking
that
--
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
if
the
officer
assumed
that
they
were
in
his
possession?
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
on
the
--
let
me
turn
to
the
facts
in
this
case
--
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
oh!
certainly.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
there
has
to
be
something
other
than
an
unfounded
assumption,
certainly.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
or
he
had
conducted
himself
in
such
a
manner
as
to
support
belief
that
they
are
there.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
think
there
can
be
no
question,
your
honor,
about
the
validity
--
let
me
separate,
first
of
all,
searches
and
seizures.
many
of
the
cases
treat
them
as
one
and
the
same.
i
think
there
can
be
no
question
about
seizure
of
evidence,
instrumentalities,
contraband,
in
plain
view.
searches
of
the
person,
of
course,
are
conceded.
as
far
as
searches
beyond
that,
it
is
very,
very
hard,
i
think,
to
find
a
logical
stopping
point,
because
we
start
with
rabinowitz,
which
permitted
a
very
narrowly
circumscribed
search
of
one
room.
now,
we
are
searching
entire
houses.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
sir?
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
oh!
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
only
logical
line
that
can
be
drawn
is
the
person,
and
those
things
which
are
in
plain
view
of
the
person
at
the
place
of
arrest.
when
it
involves
going
into
containers,
so
to
speak,
then
i
think
the
legitimate
scope
of
the
search
has
been
exceeded.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
in
looking
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
were
three
officers.
it
would
have
been
a
very
simple
thing,
if
they
wanted
to
do
so,
to
leave
one
officer
there
and
obtain
a
search
warrant.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
true,
your
honor,
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
the
officer
describes
this
as
a
general
search.
he
wasn't
searching
for
anything
specific,
so
it
seems
to
me
clear
on
his
testimony
that
he
was
exploring
this
house.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
questioned
him
on
that
and
he
didn't
so
testify.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
that
is
true,
your
honor.
this
is
a
hard
point
here,
and
i
think
it
bears
emphasis
that
the
case
on
which
they
had
probable
cause
was
coins
and
coins
alone,
so
far
as
the
record
shows,
and
the
seizure
was
of
medals,
tokens,
boxes,
wallets,
razor
blades,
things
which
weren't
even
in
the
same
class.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
it
is,
your
honor,
yes.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
thank
you.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
none
i
also
have
some
figures.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
no,
he
did
not
admit.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
thank
you,
your
honor.
to
pursue
this
same
point
a
little
bit
on
the
matter
of
warrants,
i
have
shortly
before
coming
here
contacted
the
clerk
of
the
municipal
court
in
los
angeles
judicial
district,
who
is
one
of
the
few
agencies
in
california,
or
anywhere,
so
far
as
i
can
find
out,
who
has
some
statistical
information
available
on
search
warrants.
to
give
you
an
idea
of
what
los
angeles
judicial
district
comprises,
the
entire
county
is
authorized
125
municipal
court
judges.
los
angeles
judicial
district,
which
is
within
that
county,
comprises
58
of
those
125
judges.
so
we
have
something
here
which
is
approaching
half
of
the
entire
county.
in
1931,
according
to
the
letters
i
have,
the
clerk
of
this
court
commenced
keeping
separate
records
of
search
warrants
issued
and
papers
received
for
search
warrants.
they
were
numbered
serially,
commencing
with
the
number
1.
as
of
march
12,
1969,
these
numbers
had
reached
1938
or,
in
other
words,
during
this
period
of
time,
there
had
been
approximately
some
50
warrants
per
year,
or
something
like
that,
although
this
is
not
a
fair
representation,
since
in
1968.
according
to
advice
i
have
personally
received
from
the
clerk,
there
were
papers
processed
in
this
judicial
district
for
179
search
warrants.
so
the
figure
has
gone
up,
but
it
was
to
me
amazingly
low
for
a
38-year
period.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
yes,
i
will.
the
1968
figures
i
obtained
myself.
the
letter
covers
the
rest.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
do
not,
your
honor.
i
looked
and
i
was
unable
--
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
do
not
know.
turning
to
rabinowitz,
i
think
it
is
necessary
to
look
to
the
fourth
amendment
itself.
i
think
we
can
see
rather
clearly
two
distinct
philosophies
in
interpretation
of
the
amendment.
rabinowitz
and
harris,
in
that
line
of
cases,
say
not
in
so
many
words,
but
in
terms
of
results
they
say,
the
fourth
amendment
consists
of
two
clauses,
one
which
prohibits
unreasonable
searches,
and
the
other
clause
sets
forth
the
procedure
for
obtaining
warrants.
the
opposing
line
of
cases
is,
of
course,
trupiano,
taylor
versus
u.s.,
and
those
similar
cases
which
say
this
is
not
true,
rather,
there
is
a
general
requirement
in
the
amendment
which
points
to
the
use
of
warrants
and
with
or
without
a
warrant,
any
search
which
is
unreasonable
does
not
comply
with
the
amendment
itself.
the
question
which
troubles
me
greatly
in
the
rabinowitz-harris
philosophy
is
that
if
the
unreasonable
search
clause
can
stand
by
itself,
and
if
there
is
not
some
requirement
somewhere
for
the
use
of
warrants
as
a
general
rule,
but
if
unreasonable
searches
covers
the
ground,
then
we've
violated
a
cardinal
principle
of
statutory
construction,
because
the
unreasonable
search
clause
really
covers
the
substance
of
what's
in
the
warrant
clause.
it's
not
necessary
to
have
the
warrant
language
there.
and
on
that
basis,
i
would
submit
that
there
must
be
something
more
to
the
amendment
which
suggests
that
under
some
conditions
a
warrant
is
required.
the
facts
in
this
case,
i
think
illustrate
with
the
search
of
a
home,
with
very
ample
time,
in
fact
conceded
no
exigent
circumstances,
grave
question
about
cause
for
searching.
if
this
case
doesn't
require
a
search
warrant,
i
ask
what
case
possibly
could,
and
if
there
is
not
a
case
that
possibly
could
require
a
warrant,
then
the
fourth
amendment
itself
is
changed.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
thus,
along
that
line
of
thought,
your
honor,
that
then,
would
cast
doubt
on
chapman.
it
would
cast
doubt
on
taylor.
it
would
cast
doubt
on
all
of
the
cases
where
there
has
been
a
search
and
not
even
an
arrest.
they
can't
all
be
wrong,
can
they?
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
my
purpose
in
addressing
myself
to
this,
your
honor,
was
that
if
the
reasonable
clause
is
to
be
given
primary
meaning,
then
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
real,
strong
reason
for
having
the
warrant
clause
in
the
amendment
at
all.
for
certainly
a
warrant
which
was
issued
without
oath
or
affirmation,
or
without
probable
cause,
would
not,
on
its
face,
be
reasonable.
mr.
keith
c.
monroe
i
think
the
amendment
must
be
read
as
a
whole,
your
honor.
