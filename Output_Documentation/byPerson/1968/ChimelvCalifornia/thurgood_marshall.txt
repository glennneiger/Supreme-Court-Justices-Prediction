justice

well,
suppose
the
officer
says,
“i
would
assume
that
he
has
them
in
his
home.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
told
the
magistrate
that,
“one
thing
i
am
sure,
he
did
rob
this
place.
i
am
certain
of
that,
and
i
assume
that
the
coins
will
be
in
his
home.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
it
your
position
that
he
has
to
so
more
than
assume
that
they
are
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
what
your
position
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
the
coins
are
there;
like
somebody
saw
him
put
them
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
far,
going
back
to
the
second
point,
when
he's
arrested,
how
far
do
you
go
beyond
search
of
a
person?
the
room?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you'd
say
--
you
would
draw
one
line
on
the
attic,
wouldn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you'd
draw
one
line
in
the
attic?
if
you
would
draw
the
other
line
at
his
person,
and
then
you
wouldn't
try
to
draw
a
line
anyplace
else?
you
would
say
certainly
he
couldn't
search
the
attic.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
what
happens
if
he
arrests
him,
takes
him
down,
and
announces
to
everybody
in
the
house
that
he
is
arresting
him
for
stealing
these
coins,
and
then
gets
a
search
warrant.
do
you
think
the
search
warrant
would
be
worth
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
chimel
--
may
i
break
in
just
one
moment
on
the
other
point?
assuming
that
they
know,
they
are
confident
that
this
man
committed
this
robbery,
and
they
see
him
in
this
side
of
town,
going
toward
his
home.
is
it
possible
that
some
detective
would
say,
“well,
if
we
arrest
him
here,
we
can
only
search
his
person;
but
if
we
let
him
go
home,
and
then
arrest
him,
we
can
search
the
attic,
the
garage,
and
anything
else”,
is
that
possible?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
different
about
that
case
and
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
didn't
they
deliberately
wait
at
home
for
him?
they
knew
where
he
was.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
once
again
we
find
the
police
are
only
interested
in
doing
favors
for
the
defendant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
were
three
officers.
justice
thurgood
marshall
their
was
three.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
regardless,
there
were
three.
justice
thurgood
marshall
went
to
the
man's
home.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
waited
for
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
after
he
came
home,
they
shook
his
house
apart?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
were
looking
for
the
coins
from
this
robbery.
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
they
didn't
find.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
george,
put
it
this
way,
they
knew
exactly
what
they
were
looking
for,
coins.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
seized
items
other
than
coins,
which
they
did
not
know
at
that
time
were
stolen.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
know
about
this
other
robbery
before
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
he
have
needed
that
to
make
the
search?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
george,
did
you
have
probable
cause
to
get
a
search
warrant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
very
simple
question,
when
the
officer
went
to
get
the
arrest
warrant,
why
didn't
he
also
ask
for
a
search
warrant
because
you
have
already
admitted
that
one
of
his
purposes
was
to
retrieve
this
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
didn't
he
write
that
other
piece
of
paper?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
you
had
enough
to
get
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
mr.
george,
my
problem
is,
i
assume
that
the
officer
knew
he
was
looking
for.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
when
he
did
the
search,
he
was
looking
for
these
coins.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
only
problem
that
you
have
and
the
officer
has,
is
to
writing
down
what
he
already
has
in
his
mind.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
had
that
information.
it
was
just
a
question
of
putting
it
on
paper.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
difficult
physically
to
dictate
it
or
write
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
it
also
be
the
possibility
that
once
he
puts
it
down
on
paper,
he
would
be
restricted
to
that
and
he
wouldn't
be
able
to
pick
up
something
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
be
a
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
there
would
be
reason
why
he
shouldn't
have
gotten
a
search
warrant,
is
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
impossible
for
him
to
write
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
couldn't
write
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
it
is
an
unreasonable
burden
for
a
police
officer
to
write.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
your
position.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
the
officer
says,
“i
would

that
he
has
them
in

justice
thurgood

thurgood

isn't

to
so
more

that
they
are
