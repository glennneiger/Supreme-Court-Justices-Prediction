he?

he
missed

well,
the
legality
of
the
search,
as
i
understand
your
case,
depends
upon
two
issues.
first
of
all,
the
search,
i
suppose
one
that
would
argue,
was
obviously
invalid
if
the
underlying
arrest
was
invalid.
justice

stewart
because
the
only
justification
for
the
search
is
that
it
was
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
therefore,
if
the
arrest
was
not
lawful,
the
search
could
not
be
lawful,

of
it
scope.

your
second
point
is,
even
if
the
arrest
was
a
lawful
arrest,
this
search
which
is
justified
only
as
an
incident
to
a
lawful

was
far
too
wide
in

to
be
incident

a

is
that

is
that
your
submission?
justice

stewart
well,
there
can
certainly
--
let's
assume
a
lawful
street
arrest
of
somebody
that
you
have
reasonable
cause
to
believe
has
a
concealed
weapon
and
let's
assume
the
arrest,
that
there
is
probable
cause,
sufficient
probable
cause,
and
that
you
do
stop
and
arrest
that
man,
then
certainly
incident
to
that
arrest
you
can
search
him.
you
would
agree
with
that?

if
in

of

you
don't

a

at

what
you
do
find
is
narcotics
on
him,
right
in

although
there
was
never
any
ground
for
a
search
warrant
to
search
his

for
narcotics,
would
you
agree
or
not
that
that's
a
perfectly
valid
search
and
seizure
of
the
narcotics.
