mr.
ronald
m.
george
the
issues
in
this
case
basically
are
was
the
search,
which
was
an
incident
of
the
concededly
valid
arrest
on
probable
cause,
rendered
unreasonable
solely
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
extended
beyond
the
room
in
which
petitioner
was
arrested?
secondly,
was
it
rendered
unreasonable
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
delay
of
some
six
hours
in
executing
the
warrant
of
arrest?
and
thirdly,
was
it
rendered
unreasonable
solely
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
was
conducted
as
an
incident
to
an
arrest
on
probable
cause,
instead
of
by
way
of
a
search
warrant?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
the
california
supreme
court,
in
this
case
and
in
the
companion
case
of
people
versus
sesslin,
held
that
the
procedure
which
had
been
followed
in
the
state
of
california
for
many,
many
years,
of
issuing
warrants
upon
complaints
which
did
not
set
out
the
factual
elements
of
probable
cause,
were
invalid,
but
the
court
held
that,
although
this
arrest
warrant
was
invalid,
there
was
ample
probable
cause
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
has
been
raised
by
the
petitioner.
we
consider
it
a
purely
frivolous
point
that's
hardly
an
unreasonable
delay.
but
petitioner
contends
that
the
execution
of
the
arrest
was
deliberately
delayed
so
as
to
permit
the
officers
to
search
the
house.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
but
the
state
supreme
court
specifically
upheld
the
arrest
on
the
theory
of
probable
cause
apart
from
the
warrant.
and
i
would
submit
that
one
could
not
find
a
case
on
which
there
was
more
probable
cause
to
arrest.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
they
waited
approximately
10
minutes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct.
the
officer
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
is
your
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
it
does
not.
first
of
all,
may
i
ask
your
honor
for
a
clarification?
are
you
speaking
of
warrants
of
arrest
when
you
speak
of
search
warrants?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
our
position
is
no
and
even
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
don't
think
it's
wasted
time
and
the
officer
here
certainly
didn't
think
it
was
wasted
time.
he
testified
expressly
that
it
was
his
habit
that
whenever
possible
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
correct.
even
trupiano
said
that.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no
that's
not
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
not
our
position,
because
clearly
a
search
may
not
be
made
upon
probable
cause.
a
search
may
be
made
only
as
an
incident
to
an
arrest
upon
probable
cause,
and
we
would
submit
that
whenever
there
is
a
proper
arrest,
and
that
the
search
is
number
one,
reasonable;
and
number
two,
incident
to
the
arrest,
that
then
there
is
no
need
to
obtain
a
search
warrant.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
one
situation
which
comes
readily
to
mind
is
the
arrest
of
a
person
--
let's
say
mr.
chimel
was
arrested
at
a
friend's
house.
now,
there
would
be
the
right
to
search
incident
to
arrest,
but
perhaps
not
the
same
type
of
search
as
you
have
here,
because
it
would
not
be
predictable
that
the
stolen
coins
would
be
at
this
friend's
house,
or
at
a
public
place.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
our
position.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
might
depend
upon
who
this
friend
was,
whether
he
had
some
connection
with
the
burglary
or
not.
now,
under
current
law,
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
definite
limitation.
this
court
has
always
said
that
we
must
view
the
legality
of
the
particular
search
in
light
of
its
reasonableness
under
the
facts
of
the
case,
and
there
can't
be
any
mechanical
standards
here.
i
think
what
significant
is
that
the
fourth
amendment,
as
it
was
drawn
up
by
the
framers,
does
not
confer
a
narrow
grant
of
the
power
to
search.
what
it
does
is
it
restricts
the
power
to
search,
the
existing
and
recognized
power
to
search,
and
prohibits
only
searches
that
are
unreasonable.
and
in
turn,
that
determination
of
reasonableness
is
a
very
practical
concept
and
it
has
been
since
it
evolved
under
common
law.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it
is
possible
that
officers
would
do
that
and
definite
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
think
it's
improper
when
the
officers
do
that.
we
concede
that,
and
there
are
cases
so
holding,
that
it's
improper.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
they
didn't.
if
i
may
answer
your
question
by
chronicling
the
events
of
that
day,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
arrest
warrant
issued
at
10:39
in
the
morning.
the
officer
submitted
the
arrest
warrant
which
he
had
obtained
and
which,
under
current
california
law
was
a
valid
arrest
warrant.
two,
the
warrant
detail
of
his
department,
this
was
customary
practice
of
his
department,
and
this
was
done
as
a
general
rule,
without
exception,
unless
there
was
a
definite
information
that
the
suspect
was
about
to
flee.
the
warrant
detail
processed
the
warrant
until
2
o'clock
that
afternoon.
now,
both
prior
to
2:00
p.m.
and
after
2:00
p.m.,
the
officer
was
involved
in
other
burglary
investigations.
he
had
a
monthly
caseload
of
45
to
80
burglaries.
he
was
involved
with
those
burglaries.
he
was
not
required;
it's
our
position,
to
drop
all
other
business
of
an
enforcement
and
investigatory
nature
in
order
to
serve
that
arrest
warrant.
all
right.
then
he
--
it
was
getting
on
in
the
afternoon.
he
was
busy
with
these
other
things.
he
might
well
have
missed
the
petitioner,
who
arrived
home
at
4:15.
he
also
testified
that
he
had
a
desire
not
to
embarrass
the
petitioner
at
his
place
of
employment.
now,
had
the
petitioner
been
released
on
bail,
as
he
was
perhaps
the
same
afternoon,
but
very
shortly
after
--
the
record
isn't
completely
clear.
and
had
the
case
not
gone
to
trial,
the
petitioner's
employer
would
never
have
learned
of
the
arrest.
the
petitioner
would
not
be
fired.
there
would
not
be
any
consequence.
his
wife
would
learn
of
it
in
any
event.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
would
not
state
that
as
a
general
proposition
and
i
would
not
be
so
naive
to
hold
that
that's
the
universal
rule.
however,
i
would
submit
that
it
is
unparalleled,
almost.
it's
impossible
to
find
a
police
officer
who
could
have
given
more
attention
to
the
observance
of
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights
than
did
this
officer.
he
did
not
arrest
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
there
were
two
officers
from
santa
ana
who
accompanied
him,
and
that
was
required
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
under
california
law
because
the
place
of
arrest,
petitioner's
home,
was
outside
the
investigating
officer's
jurisdiction.
and
under
california
law,
then,
it
has
since
been
changed,
officer
del
coma
would
not
have
had
the
right
to
go
outside
the
city
of
orange
to
arrest
petitioner
at
petitioner's
santa
ana
home.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
there
were
three
and
there
was
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
they
went
to
the
man's
home.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
and
waited
10
minutes
for
him?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
they
did
not
shake
his
house
apart.
they
searched
the
house
very
carefully
with
petitioner's
wife.
they
asked
her
to
accompany
them.
they
had
her
open
drawers.
they
did
not
ransack.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
that
is
not
the
case.
the
only
--
and
i
wish
to
correct
prior
statement
on
that
that
was
made
in
the
preceding
argument.
the
record
shows
that
no
coins
were
positively
identified
as
coming
from
that
burglary,
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
there
were
no
coins
seized.
the
inference
is
very
strong
that
many
of
the
coins
were
from
the
money
vault
burglary.
we
have
set
out
the
--
an
inventory
of
the
coins
seized
in
our
brief
as
an
appendix,
and
if
you
compare
those
items
to
some
of
the
items
seized
from
mr.
slocum's
store
during
the
burglary,
there
is
a
great
similarity.
but
we
know
that
coins
are
by
their
very
nature
almost
fungible
items,
with
a
few
exceptions,
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
say,
“that
is
my
nickel.”
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
monroe
has
implied
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
there's
some
indication
that
the
arresting
officer
had
some
knowledge
that
there
was
another
burglary,
but
he
had
no
detailed
information,
as
mr.
monroe
pointed
out.
there
was
not
a
wholesale
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
he
would
not
have
needed
that
other
information.
he
was
looking
for
one
thing
only,
and
that
was
evidence,
stolen
fruits
of
the
burglary
for
which
he
was
arresting
the
petitioner.
and
that
was
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
exactly
and
i
would
like
to
clarify
the
record
on
that.
there
was
some
confusion.
the
item
seized
consisted
of
coins,
coin
paraphernalia,
and
one
item
that
does
not
fall
into
that
category
--
a
quantity
of
razor
blades,
and
why
razor
blades?
the
officer
was
asked
that.
well,
because
petitioner
had
said
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
“these
razor
blades
are
part
of
the
coin
transaction.”
now,
that
is
susceptible
of
the
inference
that
they
could
have
been
part
of
the
money
vault
burglary
transaction,
but
there
is
nothing
that
was
not
reasonably
apparent
as
to
be
part
of
the
money
vault
burglary
that
was
seized.
it
was
a
very
limited
search
that
was
confined
by
the
objective
of
the
officer,
which
was
a
permissible
objective,
namely,
to
return
the
stolen
property.
this
was
three-fourths
of
the
man's
inventory
that
had
been
wiped
out,
and
the
officers
merely
wanted
to
return
that
property
to
their
rightful
owner,
and
their
search
was
45
minutes
and
was
confined
to
that.
now,
petitioner
has
implied
that
this
was
a
wholesale
ransacking
of
the
house.
this
isn't
true.
the
record
indicates
unequivocally
and
we've
set
it
out
in
detail
in
our
brief
that
there
were
only
two
rooms
that
were
really
searched
in
the
sense
of
what
a
search
is,
prying
into
hidden
places.
they
were
a
bedroom,
and
a
second
bedroom
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
this
was
a
3-bedroom
tract
home,
tract-size
home.
that's
how
it
was
described
in
the
record,
whatever
that
means,
a
suburban
house.
and
these
two
rooms
were
searched
in
the
sense
of
drawers
being
opened
and
petitioner's
wife
being
asked
to
move
the
contents
of
the
drawers
to
one
side,
to
offer
an
innocuous
explanation
for
any
coins,
and
the
officers
left
many
coins.
they
only
took
those
which
appeared
to
be
connected
with
the
money
vault.
and
now,
these
other
rooms,
the
officer
testified,
he
glanced
into
them.
this
was
a
cursory
search.
he
looked
into
the
garage.
he
looked
into
the
child's
room.
but
this
was
not
a
search.
the
search
was
confined
to
two
rooms
and
its
objective
was
perfectly
permissible,
and
the
search
was
of
45
minutes
duration.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
incorrect
information.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
i
will
indicate
that.
i
want
to
preface
that
by
stating
that
the
california
supreme
court,
in
its
keener
decision
has,
which
we
have
cited,
has
evidence
a
policy
encouraging
the
use
of
warrants.
we
cite
an
article
in
the
official
publication
of
the
california
peace
officers
bulletin
encouraging
officers
to
use
search
warrants,
an
article
by
the
district
attorney.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
out
of
the
city,
but
certain
parts;
yes.
it's
not
countywide.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
the
city
of
los
angeles,
i
would
say
approximately
200,
i
would
think.
most
of
those
in
the
los
angeles
judicial
district
are
in
the
city
of
los
angeles.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
now,
this
is
a
thirteen-fold
increase
since
1954,
which
is
the
year
that
the
california
supreme
court
anticipated
this
court's
decision
in
mapp
and
required
the
exclusionary
rule
to
be
followed
in
california.
and
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
to
the
chapman
case,
california
has
been
in
the
forefront
of
all
the
states
in
laying
down
rules
protecting
the
rights
of
criminal
suspects
both
in
its
--
in
the
field
of
confessions
and
search
and
seizure.
the
state
has
encouraged
the
use
of
warrants
and
they
are
being
used
increasingly.
each
year
the
number
increases.
so
--
and
this
officer
here
testified,
he
will
obtain
an
arrest
warrant,
as
he
tried
to
do
here.
the
law
was
changed
after
he
obtained
it.
it
was
his
policy
to
get
one.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
they
got
coins,
coin
paraphernalia,
and
this
one
item
of
a
few
razor
blades.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
there
were
two
burglaries,
of
course.
and
it
was
--
some
of
the
coins
were
definitely
identified
as
coming
from
a
second
burglary
because
they
were
unusual
coins.
they
were
odd
metals.
we've
set
them
forth.
things
like
alaska
centennial
coin
or
something
like
this,
that
the
pulati's
recognized
immediately,
or
else
a
container
of
coins
with
mr.
pulati's
handwriting
crossed
out.
so,
of
course,
those
were
able
to
be
identified
but
they
were
35
coins
out
of
this
quantity,
a
large
quantity,
of
coins.
the
other
coins,
there
was
every
strong
inference
that
they
were
one
and
the
same
from
the
burglary
for
which
the
officers
had
made
the
arrest.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
the
defendant
did
testify.
he
gave
an
explanation
that
was
so
inherently
improbable
of
his
guilt
that
we
would
submit
that
it
afforded
consciousness
of
guilt
evidence
of
his
guilt.
it
was
a
highly
unlikely
explanation.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
he
testified
in
his
own
behalf
and
gave
such
a
contrived
explanation
of
how
he
had
come
in
possession
of
some
of
these
coins
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
he
did.
and
he
said
that
he
had
purchased
them
from
a
man,
and
he
didn't
know
whom,
and
he
didn't
collect
medals
but
he
had
bought
these
medals
anyway,
and
it
was
a
very
obvious
attempt
to
fabricate
an
explanation
for
them.
and
in
fact,
he
changed
his
testimony
with
reference
to
one
coin,
that
he
didn't
know
how
he
had
obtained
that,
but
later
on
he
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
bought
it.
he
gave
no
satisfactory
explanation.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
true,
yes.
in
fact,
there
was
a
stipulation
between
mr.
monroe
and
the
district
attorney
who
tried
the
case
that
the
coins
identified
by
the
pulati's,
found
on
the
premises,
were
the
same
coins
that
were
at
the
pulati's
home
on
the
night
of
their
burglary.
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
he
was,
and
was
convicted
of
both.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
he
was.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
no.
there
was
no
--
there
were
no
coins
found
at
petitioner's
house
that
were
tied
into
that
burglary
positively,
but
there
was
another
coin,
a
very
unusual
coin
with
four
faulty
markings
that
two
months,
i
believe,
after
the
search,
petitioner
sold
to
a
coin
dealer,
and
this
was
a
coin
from
the
money
vault
burglary.
and
there's
a
great
length
of
testimony
in
that
regard
and
that
was
established
clearly.
it
was
a
very
unusual
coin.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
it
was.
both
accounts
were
joined.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
in
light
of
all
of
the
officer's
conduct
here.
the
officer
had
the
admissions
of
the
defendant
to
various
civilian
witnesses
that
he
had
committed
the
burglary
in
question.
the
defendant
was
negotiating
to
return
the
coins.
the
officer
attempted
to
obtain
an
arrest
warrant,
conducted
a
great
many
sessions
with
the
district
attorney's
office,
before
he
would
deprive
petitioner
of
his
freedom.
the
district
attorney's
office
said,
“well,
we
think
you
have
enough
information,
but
go
out
and
get
another
one,
talk
to
this
witness.”
he
did
that.
only
then
that
did
he
decide
to
make
the
arrest.
the
search
was
incident
to
the
arrest.
clearly,
it
was
the
same
time
and
place.
the
objective
was
as
legitimate
as
any
imaginable,
to
return
thousands
of
dollars
of
stolen
coins
to
their
true
owner.
only
coins
and
coin
paraphernalia
that
appeared
to
be
connected
with
that
particular
burglary
were
seized.
the
manner
of
conducting
the
search
was
inherently
reasonable.
he
had
to
bring
along
santa
ana
officers
to
legitimatize
the
search,
since
it
was
outside
of
his
jurisdiction.
he
announced
his
entry,
identified
himself,
asked
whether
he
could
enter,
treated
the
defendant
with
utmost
courtesy.
he
informed
the
defendant
of
the
warrant,
showed
it
to
him,
let
him
read
it.
he
asked
whether
he
could
search,
although
consent
was
not
given.
but
he
informed
the
defendant
that
he
had
the
right
search
anyway.
the
defendant's
wife
was
the
one
who
opened
the
drawer
so
there
would
not
be
any
ransacking.
the
officer
proceeded
as
quickly
as
he
could.
he
took
only
45
minutes
to
search.
and
then
the
officer
took
the
defendant
to
the
station
and
the
two
of
them
compiled
an
inventory
of
all
of
the
seized
property,
defendant
was
shown
the
inventory
and
he
signed
a
copy.
now,
what
can
be
unreasonable
in
this
search?
certainly,
not
the
scope.
the
scope
was
certainly
proper.
the
objective
of
returning
the
coins
to
their
stolen
--
owner
--
to
the
owner
rather
--
the
returning
the
stolen
coins
to
the
owner
would
not
be
served
by
arbitrarily
saying,
“well,
you
can
search
this
room,
but
not
that
one,
this
cupboard,
not
that
one.”
if
we
started
setting
down
standards
like
that,
the
police
and
the
courts
would
certainly
be
confused.
what
size
of
a
room
could
you
search?
what
circumference
around
the
defendant?
we
submit
that
the
rabinowitz
standard
of
reasonableness
under
all
the
circumstances
is
the
proper
standard
especially
in
light
of
the
fact
that
we
have
a
state
conviction
here,
under
our
federal
system,
and
under
the
court's
decision
in
ker,
the
states
may
develop
workable
rules
of
search
and
seizure.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
what
california
has
done.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
our
legal
basis
is,
first
of
all,
the
agnello
decision.
the
full
citation
is
in
our
brief
at
page
392.
it
indicates
the
evidence
of
--
that
fruit
of
the
crime
may
be
searched.
the
rabinowitz
decision
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it
doesn't
speak
in
terms
of
arbitrary
geographical
limitations.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
depending
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
let's
say
we
have
a
television
set
involved
here.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
because
the
objective
of
returning
them
to
their
owner
is
certainly
legitimate
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
all
right.
in
this
case,
we
submit
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it's
easy
to
speak
in
terms
of
one
case
and
say
“well,
the
officer
could
have
taken
the
two
or
three
hours
to
obtain
a
search
warrant,”
and
that's
what
a
commentator
states
it
takes
under
ideal
conditions
to
obtain
one.
but
if
you
multiply
this
across
the
country,
the
last
year
for
which
there
were
statistics,
there
were
1,600,000
burglaries
committed
in
the
united
states
alone.
now,
if
you
multiply
that
paper
work
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
what
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
true,
but
all
he
was
trying
to
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
would
say
we
do
not
agree
with
that,
and
i'll
tell
you
why.
the
officer
thought
that
he
was
only
seizing
coins
from
that
burglary.
he
had
--
there
were
many
boxes
and
containers
of
coins.
he
would
have
delayed
the
defendant
hours
had
it
taken
each
box,
sorted
out
a
few
medals
that
apparently
that
would
not
have
been
involved
with
one
burglary,
and
gone
through.
the
defendant
would
have
been
standing
there
all
day.
it
was,
in
fact
if
he
saw
a
box
that
appeared
to
contain
coins
from
the
money
vault
burglary,
it's
our
position
he
was
entitled
to
take
that
container,
that
box.
the
inventory
of
the
items
seized
indicates
that
there
were
many,
many
--
there
were
perhaps
hundreds
or
thousands
of
coins
seized.
there
were
many,
many
containers.
the
officer
could
not
pick
through
each
one
individually.
that
would
have
been
an
impossible
task.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
true.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
he
could.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes
and
even
if
not
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
now,
we
recognize
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
that
is
not
all.
i
don't
think
you
can
say
it
would
just
be
trouble.
you
have
to,
under
the
fourth
amendment,
we
submit,
look
at
it
in
terms
of
what
is
reasonable
and
as
part
of
reasonableness,
this
court
has
always
looked
at
the
practical
effect
on
law
enforcement.
now,
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
exactly.
it's
so
simple
that
one
wonders
why
not
with
an
officer
who
is
as
eager
to
protect
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights.
and
that
answer
is,
under
this
court's
decisions,
specifically
marron
and
stanford
versus
texas,
there
is
a
very
stringent
requirement
of
particular
description.
it
would
not
have
been
enough
for
the
officer
to
say,
to
describe
the
property
to
be
seized
as
coins
and
coin
paraphernalia
stolen
from
the
money
vault.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
but
what
would
the
officer
have
had
to
do
to
get
one?
he
would
have
had
to
describe
these
coins
in
great
detail.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
we're
not,
because
the
officer
could
have
obtained
a
search
warrant.
it
might
have
taken
him
two
weeks
to
do
it
because
he
would
have
had
to
distinguish
the
stolen
coins
from
the
coins
that
would
be
found
on
the
premises.
he
knew
that
petitioner
was
a
coin
collector.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
they
do
sometimes,
and
the
reason
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it
varies
according
to
jurisdiction.
i
wouldn't
say
ordinarily
across
the
country,
no.
but
i
think
that
there
are
incentives
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
that
will
make
officers
get
them
at
time,
and
i
would
like
to
mention
some
of
those
to
the
court.
there
is
a
presumption
of
legality
that
attends
a
search
effected
by
a
search
warrant.
in
many
jurisdictions
and
in
california,
if
the
officer
does
not
have
a
search
warrant,
the
search
is
presumed
to
be
illegal
in
california
and
the
burden
is
on
the
prosecution
to
obtain
a
search
warrant,
a
justification
for
the
search.
it
must
show
that
there
was
probable
cause
and
that
the
search
was
incident
to
an
arrest.
secondly,
the
fact
that
there
was
a
search
warrant
will
insulate
the
officer
from
civil
and
criminal
liability
that
will
not
be
the
case
if
there
is
not
a
search
warrant.
finally,
or
rather
additionally,
there
is
also
an
opportunity
for
a
broader
search
if
there
is
a
search
warrant.
the
officer
will
be
able
to
search
outbuildings
and
throughout
the
premises
and
take
as
long
as
he
wants
if
he
has
a
search
warrant.
there
will
also
be
the
possibility
of
search
in
the
absence
of
the
suspect.
if
he
doesn't
arrest
the
suspect
at
the
house,
of
course,
he
couldn't
search
incident
to
an
arrest.
so
this
way,
with
a
search
warrant,
he
can
search
the
house
in
the
absence
of
the
defendant.
if
there
are
multiple
suspects,
as
there
often
are
in
narcotics
raids
or
other
conspiracy
crimes,
let's
say,
he
can
search
many
places.
the
police
force
can
simultaneously,
even
if
one
or
more
defendants
are
absent.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
without
the
arrest.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
because
the
officer
had
sufficient
information
to
make
the
most
basic
invasion
of
the
defendant's
privacy
that
one
can
imagine.
the
seizure
of
his
body.
now,
how
much
more
of
an
invasion
of
privacy
is
it
for
the
officer
to
also
seize
items
around
the
defendant?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
true,
but
you
could
have
searched
his
office.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
but
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
it
was
maneuvered.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
there
are
various
justifications.
he
might
have
weapons
there.
he
might
try
to
destroy
evidence.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
of
that
sort.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
it's
different
from
a
--
for
a
television
theft
or
for
stolen
checks.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
where
coins
could
have
been
hidden
and,
of
course,
it's
not
open
to
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
of
course,
that
would
support
the
officer's
not
having
to
leave
and
come
back
with
a
warrant
later.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
what
it
does
is,
the
practical
burden
that
would've
been
imposed
on
this
officer
to
describe
thousands
of
coins
with
sufficient
particularity,
as
would
be
required
under
this
court's
decision,
to
distinguish
them
from
the
defendant's
coins
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
marron.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
marron
describes
the
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
at
least
to
the
degree
necessary
to
distinguish
them
from
the
defendant's
own
coins,
which
the
officers
knew
would
be
on
the
premises
and
because
there
is
authority,
and
we
have
cited
it
in
our
brief,
that
the
description
must
be
adequate
to
segregate
lawful
property,
the
defendant's
own
property,
from
the
items
to
be
seized.
and
that
is
why
the
officer
did
not
get
a
search
warrant.
very
frankly,
off
the
record,
i
asked
the
officer,
“why
didn't
you,”
as
justice
marshall
asked,
“if
you
were
down
there
and
you
executed
this
affidavit
for
the
arrest
warrant,
why
didn't
you
also
get
a
search
warrant?”
and
that's
it.
he
didn't
want
to
get
a
search
warrant
that
would
get
knocked
out
if
it
just
described
the
coins
in
a
general
way.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
he
did.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
he
had
--
he
would
have
had
to
write
down
the
description
that
the
victim
told
him,
“well,
this
is
my
coin
because
it's
this
age,
and
maybe
it's
marked
up
this
way,
and
therefore
i
know
this
nickel
from
somebody
else's
nickel.”
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
would
have
been
quite
a
difficult
problem
and
the
officer
chose
to
have
the
coins
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
both,
and
also
to
reduce
certain
conceptual
matters
to
writing.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
didn't
trouble
him,
because
he
left
coins
on
the
premises.
he
left
many,
many
coins.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
oh,
there
definitely
is.
it
would
have
been
an
impossible
task
for
him
to
do
it,
almost.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
considering
the
number
of
coins.
they
are
listed
in
our
appendix
here.
there
are
hundreds,
if
not
thousands,
of
coins
until
i
get
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
this
would've
been
an
unreasonable
burden
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
in
certain
situations
to
give
this
kind
of
a
description
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
would
be
like
describing
the
grains
of
sand
on
a
beach.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
the
officer
apparently
had
a
general
description,
at
least,
of
particular
types
of
coins
right
with
him,
and
if
he
saw
a
particular
container
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
pardon
me?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it
might
not
have
been
sufficient.
of
course,
this
court
has
been
very
stringent.
if
you
don't
dot
your
“i's”
and
cross
your
“t's”
in
getting
the
search
warrant
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
he
thought
it
was
sufficient
information.
he
thought
that
it
would
have
been
very,
very
difficult
to
meet
this
burden
of
setting
it
all
out
in
writing
and
having
it
stand
up
and
he
thought
it
wasn't
necessary
in
view
of
this
court's
decisions
stretching
back
many,
many
years,
that
a
search
is
reasonable
if
it
is
incident
to
an
arrest.
that
is
why
he
thought
that
he
did
not
have
to.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
not
in
the
record.
no.
the
only
figure
related
to
that
is
the
number
of
burglary
investigations
that
officer
del
coma
himself
had
for
a
month,
but
the
number
of
search
warrants
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
have
only
a
letter
from
the
district
attorney's
office.
i
thought
the
court
might
be
interested
in
that
point
and
i
inquired.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
may
i
file
with
the
court
the
letter
that
i
received
from
the
district
attorney's
office?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
the
defendant,
prior
to
the
burglary
itself,
had
approached
the
victim
and
said,
“how
would
you
like
to
have
you
place
knocked
off,”
and
“do
you
carry
insurance,”
and
all
of
that.
shortly
before
the
burglary,
just
a
few
hours,
he
told
a
friend,
“i
have
a
big
job
going,
we're
going
to
knock
off
a
coin
shop,
maybe
$50,000
or
$60,000
are
involved.”
mr.
ronald
m.
george
a
coin
shop.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
then
shortly
afterwards,
he
told
the
same
friend,
“well,
we
broke
through
the
two
walls
and
we
came
across
the
wires,
but
we
didn't
really
go
through
with
the
job
completely.”
then
the
next
day
he
told
the
fellow,
“oh,
well
i
was
just
kidding
,don't
believe
what
i
said.”
then
he
told
another
person
after
the
burglary,
“i
am
involved
in
the
money
vault
burglary,
i
may
be
going
to
jail
on
that.”
then
he
negotiated
with
the
police
for
the
return
of
the
coins.
this
man
broadcast
all
over
town
that
he
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
for
the
return
of
the
coins,
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
he
and
another
suspect
and
an
attorney,
who
the
record
indicates
was
representing
both
suspects,
negotiated
for
the
return
of
the
coins
for
a
civil
release.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
at
the
police
station
so
this
--
mr.
ronald

guilt
and
the
probable
cause
was
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
i
can't
imagine
a
case
with
more.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
he
gave
a
very
unlikely
explanation.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
for
one
minute
to
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
thank
you
very
much.
one
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
in
concluding
was
that
the
issue
here
under
the
rabinowitz
test
is
not
really
whether
or
not
it
is
the
police
officer
or
the
magistrate
who
is
to
make
the
decision
to
arrest
and
search;
but
rather,
whether
it
is
the
magistrate
who
will
decide
it
before
the
search
or
the
magistrate
after
the
search
because
of
course
as
this
court
has
noted,
it's
the
exclusionary
rule
which
is
the
most
effective
means
of
deterring
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
and
as
we
have
attempted
to
point
out
in
our
brief,
california
affords
many,
many
opportunities
at
all
stages
of
the
proceedings
to
invoke
the
exclusionary
rule
and
that
means
has
certainly
been
effective,
if
not
more
effective,
than
the
somewhat
cursory
examination
which
is
given
prior
to
issuing
a
search
warrant.
and
i
want
to
note
that
i
did
find
the
letter,
which
i'll
file
with
the
clerk.
it
does
not
cover
just
the
city
of
los
angeles.
it
covers
the
entire
county
of
los
angeles,
those
search
warrants
issued
by
the
district
attorney,
but
not
by
other
law
enforcement
agencies.
it
shows
that
a
total
of
225
search
warrant
issued
by
the
district
attorney
of
los
angeles
county
during
1968
and
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
true,
yes.
approximately
seven
million
people
but
this
does
not
cover
the
various
other
law
enforcement
agencies
in
the
city
rather
in
the
county
which
have
also
issued
search
warrants.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
search
warrants?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
searches?
i
think
that's
a
fair
assumption.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
the
issues
in
this
case
basically
are
was
the
search,
which
was
an
incident
of
the
concededly
valid
arrest
on
probable
cause,
rendered
unreasonable
solely
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
extended
beyond
the
room
in
which
petitioner
was
arrested?
secondly,
was
it
rendered
unreasonable
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
there
was
a
delay
of
some
six
hours
in
executing
the
warrant
of
arrest?
and
thirdly,
was
it
rendered
unreasonable
solely
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
it
was
conducted
as
an
incident
to
an
arrest
on
probable
cause,
instead
of
by
way
of
a
search
warrant?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
the
california
supreme
court,
in
this
case
and
in
the
companion
case
of
people
versus
sesslin,
held
that
the
procedure
which
had
been
followed
in
the
state
of
california
for
many,
many
years,
of
issuing
warrants
upon
complaints
which
did
not
set
out
the
factual
elements
of
probable
cause,
were
invalid,
but
the
court
held
that,
although
this
arrest
warrant
was
invalid,
there
was
ample
probable
cause
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
has
been
raised
by
the
petitioner.
we
consider
it
a
purely
frivolous
point
that's
hardly
an
unreasonable
delay.
but
petitioner
contends
that
the
execution
of
the
arrest
was
deliberately
delayed
so
as
to
permit
the
officers
to
search
the
house.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
but
the
state
supreme
court
specifically
upheld
the
arrest
on
the
theory
of
probable
cause
apart
from
the
warrant.
and
i
would
submit
that
one
could
not
find
a
case
on
which
there
was
more
probable
cause
to
arrest.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
they
waited
approximately
10
minutes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct.
the
officer
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
is
your
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
it
does
not.
first
of
all,
may
i
ask
your
honor
for
a
clarification?
are
you
speaking
of
warrants
of
arrest
when
you
speak
of
search
warrants?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
our
position
is
no
and
even
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
don't
think
it's
wasted
time
and
the
officer
here
certainly
didn't
think
it
was
wasted
time.
he
testified
expressly
that
it
was
his
habit
that
whenever
possible
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
correct.
even
trupiano
said
that.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no
that's
not
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
not
our
position,
because
clearly
a
search
may
not
be
made
upon
probable
cause.
a
search
may
be
made
only
as
an
incident
to
an
arrest
upon
probable
cause,
and
we
would
submit
that
whenever
there
is
a
proper
arrest,
and
that
the
search
is
number
one,
reasonable;
and
number
two,
incident
to
the
arrest,
that
then
there
is
no
need
to
obtain
a
search
warrant.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
one
situation
which
comes
readily
to
mind
is
the
arrest
of
a
person
--
let's
say
mr.
chimel
was
arrested
at
a
friend's
house.
now,
there
would
be
the
right
to
search
incident
to
arrest,
but
perhaps
not
the
same
type
of
search
as
you
have
here,
because
it
would
not
be
predictable
that
the
stolen
coins
would
be
at
this
friend's
house,
or
at
a
public
place.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
our
position.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
might
depend
upon
who
this
friend
was,
whether
he
had
some
connection
with
the
burglary
or
not.
now,
under
current
law,
there
does
not
seem
to
be
any
definite
limitation.
this
court
has
always
said
that
we
must
view
the
legality
of
the
particular
search
in
light
of
its
reasonableness
under
the
facts
of
the
case,
and
there
can't
be
any
mechanical
standards
here.
i
think
what
significant
is
that
the
fourth
amendment,
as
it
was
drawn
up
by
the
framers,
does
not
confer
a
narrow
grant
of
the
power
to
search.
what
it
does
is
it
restricts
the
power
to
search,
the
existing
and
recognized
power
to
search,
and
prohibits
only
searches
that
are
unreasonable.
and
in
turn,
that
determination
of
reasonableness
is
a
very
practical
concept
and
it
has
been
since
it
evolved
under
common
law.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it
is
possible
that
officers
would
do
that
and
definite
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
think
it's
improper
when
the
officers
do
that.
we
concede
that,
and
there
are
cases
so
holding,
that
it's
improper.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
they
didn't.
if
i
may
answer
your
question
by
chronicling
the
events
of
that
day,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
arrest
warrant
issued
at
10:39
in
the
morning.
the
officer
submitted
the
arrest
warrant
which
he
had
obtained
and
which,
under
current
california
law
was
a
valid
arrest
warrant.
two,
the
warrant
detail
of
his
department,
this
was
customary
practice
of
his
department,
and
this
was
done
as
a
general
rule,
without
exception,
unless
there
was
a
definite
information
that
the
suspect
was
about
to
flee.
the
warrant
detail
processed
the
warrant
until
2
o'clock
that
afternoon.
now,
both
prior
to
2:00
p.m.
and
after
2:00
p.m.,
the
officer
was
involved
in
other
burglary
investigations.
he
had
a
monthly
caseload
of
45
to
80
burglaries.
he
was
involved
with
those
burglaries.
he
was
not
required;
it's
our
position,
to
drop
all
other
business
of
an
enforcement
and
investigatory
nature
in
order
to
serve
that
arrest
warrant.
all
right.
then
he
--
it
was
getting
on
in
the
afternoon.
he
was
busy
with
these
other
things.
he
might
well
have
missed
the
petitioner,
who
arrived
home
at
4:15.
he
also
testified
that
he
had
a
desire
not
to
embarrass
the
petitioner
at
his
place
of
employment.
now,
had
the
petitioner
been
released
on
bail,
as
he
was
perhaps
the
same
afternoon,
but
very
shortly
after
--
the
record
isn't
completely
clear.
and
had
the
case
not
gone
to
trial,
the
petitioner's
employer
would
never
have
learned
of
the
arrest.
the
petitioner
would
not
be
fired.
there
would
not
be
any
consequence.
his
wife
would
learn
of
it
in
any
event.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
would
not
state
that
as
a
general
proposition
and
i
would
not
be
so
naive
to
hold
that
that's
the
universal
rule.
however,
i
would
submit
that
it
is
unparalleled,
almost.
it's
impossible
to
find
a
police
officer
who
could
have
given
more
attention
to
the
observance
of
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights
than
did
this
officer.
he
did
not
arrest
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
there
were
two
officers
from
santa
ana
who
accompanied
him,
and
that
was
required
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
under
california
law
because
the
place
of
arrest,
petitioner's
home,
was
outside
the
investigating
officer's
jurisdiction.
and
under
california
law,
then,
it
has
since
been
changed,
officer
del
coma
would
not
have
had
the
right
to
go
outside
the
city
of
orange
to
arrest
petitioner
at
petitioner's
santa
ana
home.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
there
were
three
and
there
was
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
they
went
to
the
man's
home.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
and
waited
10
minutes
for
him?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
they
did
not
shake
his
house
apart.
they
searched
the
house
very
carefully
with
petitioner's
wife.
they
asked
her
to
accompany
them.
they
had
her
open
drawers.
they
did
not
ransack.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
that
is
not
the
case.
the
only
--
and
i
wish
to
correct
prior
statement
on
that
that
was
made
in
the
preceding
argument.
the
record
shows
that
no
coins
were
positively
identified
as
coming
from
that
burglary,
but
that
is
not
to
say
that
there
were
no
coins
seized.
the
inference
is
very
strong
that
many
of
the
coins
were
from
the
money
vault
burglary.
we
have
set
out
the
--
an
inventory
of
the
coins
seized
in
our
brief
as
an
appendix,
and
if
you
compare
those
items
to
some
of
the
items
seized
from
mr.
slocum's
store
during
the
burglary,
there
is
a
great
similarity.
but
we
know
that
coins
are
by
their
very
nature
almost
fungible
items,
with
a
few
exceptions,
and
it
is
very
difficult
to
say,
“that
is
my
nickel.”
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
that
is
not
the
case.
mr.
monroe
has
implied
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
there's
some
indication
that
the
arresting
officer
had
some
knowledge
that
there
was
another
burglary,
but
he
had
no
detailed
information,
as
mr.
monroe
pointed
out.
there
was
not
a
wholesale
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
he
would
not
have
needed
that
other
information.
he
was
looking
for
one
thing
only,
and
that
was
evidence,
stolen
fruits
of
the
burglary
for
which
he
was
arresting
the
petitioner.
and
that
was
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
exactly
and
i
would
like
to
clarify
the
record
on
that.
there
was
some
confusion.
the
item
seized
consisted
of
coins,
coin
paraphernalia,
and
one
item
that
does
not
fall
into
that
category
--
a
quantity
of
razor
blades,
and
why
razor
blades?
the
officer
was
asked
that.
well,
because
petitioner
had
said
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
“these
razor
blades
are
part
of
the
coin
transaction.”
now,
that
is
susceptible
of
the
inference
that
they
could
have
been
part
of
the
money
vault
burglary
transaction,
but
there
is
nothing
that
was
not
reasonably
apparent
as
to
be
part
of
the
money
vault
burglary
that
was
seized.
it
was
a
very
limited
search
that
was
confined
by
the
objective
of
the
officer,
which
was
a
permissible
objective,
namely,
to
return
the
stolen
property.
this
was
three-fourths
of
the
man's
inventory
that
had
been
wiped
out,
and
the
officers
merely
wanted
to
return
that
property
to
their
rightful
owner,
and
their
search
was
45
minutes
and
was
confined
to
that.
now,
petitioner
has
implied
that
this
was
a
wholesale
ransacking
of
the
house.
this
isn't
true.
the
record
indicates
unequivocally
and
we've
set
it
out
in
detail
in
our
brief
that
there
were
only
two
rooms
that
were
really
searched
in
the
sense
of
what
a
search
is,
prying
into
hidden
places.
they
were
a
bedroom,
and
a
second
bedroom
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
this
was
a
3-bedroom
tract
home,
tract-size
home.
that's
how
it
was
described
in
the
record,
whatever
that
means,
a
suburban
house.
and
these
two
rooms
were
searched
in
the
sense
of
drawers
being
opened
and
petitioner's
wife
being
asked
to
move
the
contents
of
the
drawers
to
one
side,
to
offer
an
innocuous
explanation
for
any
coins,
and
the
officers
left
many
coins.
they
only
took
those
which
appeared
to
be
connected
with
the
money
vault.
and
now,
these
other
rooms,
the
officer
testified,
he
glanced
into
them.
this
was
a
cursory
search.
he
looked
into
the
garage.
he
looked
into
the
child's
room.
but
this
was
not
a
search.
the
search
was
confined
to
two
rooms
and
its
objective
was
perfectly
permissible,
and
the
search
was
of
45
minutes
duration.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
incorrect
information.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
i
will
indicate
that.
i
want
to
preface
that
by
stating
that
the
california
supreme
court,
in
its
keener
decision
has,
which
we
have
cited,
has
evidence
a
policy
encouraging
the
use
of
warrants.
we
cite
an
article
in
the
official
publication
of
the
california
peace
officers
bulletin
encouraging
officers
to
use
search
warrants,
an
article
by
the
district
attorney.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
out
of
the
city,
but
certain
parts;
yes.
it's
not
countywide.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
the
city
of
los
angeles,
i
would
say
approximately
200,
i
would
think.
most
of
those
in
the
los
angeles
judicial
district
are
in
the
city
of
los
angeles.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
now,
this
is
a
thirteen-fold
increase
since
1954,
which
is
the
year
that
the
california
supreme
court
anticipated
this
court's
decision
in
mapp
and
required
the
exclusionary
rule
to
be
followed
in
california.
and
as
mr.
justice
harlan
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
to
the
chapman
case,
california
has
been
in
the
forefront
of
all
the
states
in
laying
down
rules
protecting
the
rights
of
criminal
suspects
both
in
its
--
in
the
field
of
confessions
and
search
and
seizure.
the
state
has
encouraged
the
use
of
warrants
and
they
are
being
used
increasingly.
each
year
the
number
increases.
so
--
and
this
officer
here
testified,
he
will
obtain
an
arrest
warrant,
as
he
tried
to
do
here.
the
law
was
changed
after
he
obtained
it.
it
was
his
policy
to
get
one.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
they
got
coins,
coin
paraphernalia,
and
this
one
item
of
a
few
razor
blades.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
there
were
two
burglaries,
of
course.
and
it
was
--
some
of
the
coins
were
definitely
identified
as
coming
from
a
second
burglary
because
they
were
unusual
coins.
they
were
odd
metals.
we've
set
them
forth.
things
like
alaska
centennial
coin
or
something
like
this,
that
the
pulati's
recognized
immediately,
or
else
a
container
of
coins
with
mr.
pulati's
handwriting
crossed
out.
so,
of
course,
those
were
able
to
be
identified
but
they
were
35
coins
out
of
this
quantity,
a
large
quantity,
of
coins.
the
other
coins,
there
was
every
strong
inference
that
they
were
one
and
the
same
from
the
burglary
for
which
the
officers
had
made
the
arrest.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
the
defendant
did
testify.
he
gave
an
explanation
that
was
so
inherently
improbable
of
his
guilt
that
we
would
submit
that
it
afforded
consciousness
of
guilt
evidence
of
his
guilt.
it
was
a
highly
unlikely
explanation.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
he
testified
in
his
own
behalf
and
gave
such
a
contrived
explanation
of
how
he
had
come
in
possession
of
some
of
these
coins
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
he
did.
and
he
said
that
he
had
purchased
them
from
a
man,
and
he
didn't
know
whom,
and
he
didn't
collect
medals
but
he
had
bought
these
medals
anyway,
and
it
was
a
very
obvious
attempt
to
fabricate
an
explanation
for
them.
and
in
fact,
he
changed
his
testimony
with
reference
to
one
coin,
that
he
didn't
know
how
he
had
obtained
that,
but
later
on
he
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
bought
it.
he
gave
no
satisfactory
explanation.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
true,
yes.
in
fact,
there
was
a
stipulation
between
mr.
monroe
and
the
district
attorney
who
tried
the
case
that
the
coins
identified
by
the
pulati's,
found
on
the
premises,
were
the
same
coins
that
were
at
the
pulati's
home
on
the
night
of
their
burglary.
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
he
was,
and
was
convicted
of
both.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
he
was.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
no.
there
was
no
--
there
were
no
coins
found
at
petitioner's
house
that
were
tied
into
that
burglary
positively,
but
there
was
another
coin,
a
very
unusual
coin
with
four
faulty
markings
that
two
months,
i
believe,
after
the
search,
petitioner
sold
to
a
coin
dealer,
and
this
was
a
coin
from
the
money
vault
burglary.
and
there's
a
great
length
of
testimony
in
that
regard
and
that
was
established
clearly.
it
was
a
very
unusual
coin.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
it
was.
both
accounts
were
joined.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
in
light
of
all
of
the
officer's
conduct
here.
the
officer
had
the
admissions
of
the
defendant
to
various
civilian
witnesses
that
he
had
committed
the
burglary
in
question.
the
defendant
was
negotiating
to
return
the
coins.
the
officer
attempted
to
obtain
an
arrest
warrant,
conducted
a
great
many
sessions
with
the
district
attorney's
office,
before
he
would
deprive
petitioner
of
his
freedom.
the
district
attorney's
office
said,
“well,
we
think
you
have
enough
information,
but
go
out
and
get
another
one,
talk
to
this
witness.”
he
did
that.
only
then
that
did
he
decide
to
make
the
arrest.
the
search
was
incident
to
the
arrest.
clearly,
it
was
the
same
time
and
place.
the
objective
was
as
legitimate
as
any
imaginable,
to
return
thousands
of
dollars
of
stolen
coins
to
their
true
owner.
only
coins
and
coin
paraphernalia
that
appeared
to
be
connected
with
that
particular
burglary
were
seized.
the
manner
of
conducting
the
search
was
inherently
reasonable.
he
had
to
bring
along
santa
ana
officers
to
legitimatize
the
search,
since
it
was
outside
of
his
jurisdiction.
he
announced
his
entry,
identified
himself,
asked
whether
he
could
enter,
treated
the
defendant
with
utmost
courtesy.
he
informed
the
defendant
of
the
warrant,
showed
it
to
him,
let
him
read
it.
he
asked
whether
he
could
search,
although
consent
was
not
given.
but
he
informed
the
defendant
that
he
had
the
right
search
anyway.
the
defendant's
wife
was
the
one
who
opened
the
drawer
so
there
would
not
be
any
ransacking.
the
officer
proceeded
as
quickly
as
he
could.
he
took
only
45
minutes
to
search.
and
then
the
officer
took
the
defendant
to
the
station
and
the
two
of
them
compiled
an
inventory
of
all
of
the
seized
property,
defendant
was
shown
the
inventory
and
he
signed
a
copy.
now,
what
can
be
unreasonable
in
this
search?
certainly,
not
the
scope.
the
scope
was
certainly
proper.
the
objective
of
returning
the
coins
to
their
stolen
--
owner
--
to
the
owner
rather
--
the
returning
the
stolen
coins
to
the
owner
would
not
be
served
by
arbitrarily
saying,
“well,
you
can
search
this
room,
but
not
that
one,
this
cupboard,
not
that
one.”
if
we
started
setting
down
standards
like
that,
the
police
and
the
courts
would
certainly
be
confused.
what
size
of
a
room
could
you
search?
what
circumference
around
the
defendant?
we
submit
that
the
rabinowitz
standard
of
reasonableness
under
all
the
circumstances
is
the
proper
standard
especially
in
light
of
the
fact
that
we
have
a
state
conviction
here,
under
our
federal
system,
and
under
the
court's
decision
in
ker,
the
states
may
develop
workable
rules
of
search
and
seizure.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
what
california
has
done.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
our
legal
basis
is,
first
of
all,
the
agnello
decision.
the
full
citation
is
in
our
brief
at
page
392.
it
indicates
the
evidence
of
--
that
fruit
of
the
crime
may
be
searched.
the
rabinowitz
decision
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it
doesn't
speak
in
terms
of
arbitrary
geographical
limitations.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
depending
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
let's
say
we
have
a
television
set
involved
here.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
because
the
objective
of
returning
them
to
their
owner
is
certainly
legitimate
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
all
right.
in
this
case,
we
submit
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it's
easy
to
speak
in
terms
of
one
case
and
say
“well,
the
officer
could
have
taken
the
two
or
three
hours
to
obtain
a
search
warrant,”
and
that's
what
a
commentator
states
it
takes
under
ideal
conditions
to
obtain
one.
but
if
you
multiply
this
across
the
country,
the
last
year
for
which
there
were
statistics,
there
were
1,600,000
burglaries
committed
in
the
united
states
alone.
now,
if
you
multiply
that
paper
work
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
what
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
true,
but
all
he
was
trying
to
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
would
say
we
do
not
agree
with
that,
and
i'll
tell
you
why.
the
officer
thought
that
he
was
only
seizing
coins
from
that
burglary.
he
had
--
there
were
many
boxes
and
containers
of
coins.
he
would
have
delayed
the
defendant
hours
had
it
taken
each
box,
sorted
out
a
few
medals
that
apparently
that
would
not
have
been
involved
with
one
burglary,
and
gone
through.
the
defendant
would
have
been
standing
there
all
day.
it
was,
in
fact
if
he
saw
a
box
that
appeared
to
contain
coins
from
the
money
vault
burglary,
it's
our
position
he
was
entitled
to
take
that
container,
that
box.
the
inventory
of
the
items
seized
indicates
that
there
were
many,
many
--
there
were
perhaps
hundreds
or
thousands
of
coins
seized.
there
were
many,
many
containers.
the
officer
could
not
pick
through
each
one
individually.
that
would
have
been
an
impossible
task.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that's
true.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
he
could.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes
and
even
if
not
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
now,
we
recognize
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
that
is
not
all.
i
don't
think
you
can
say
it
would
just
be
trouble.
you
have
to,
under
the
fourth
amendment,
we
submit,
look
at
it
in
terms
of
what
is
reasonable
and
as
part
of
reasonableness,
this
court
has
always
looked
at
the
practical
effect
on
law
enforcement.
now,
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
exactly.
it's
so
simple
that
one
wonders
why
not
with
an
officer
who
is
as
eager
to
protect
the
defendant's
constitutional
rights.
and
that
answer
is,
under
this
court's
decisions,
specifically
marron
and
stanford
versus
texas,
there
is
a
very
stringent
requirement
of
particular
description.
it
would
not
have
been
enough
for
the
officer
to
say,
to
describe
the
property
to
be
seized
as
coins
and
coin
paraphernalia
stolen
from
the
money
vault.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
but
what
would
the
officer
have
had
to
do
to
get
one?
he
would
have
had
to
describe
these
coins
in
great
detail.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
no,
we're
not,
because
the
officer
could
have
obtained
a
search
warrant.
it
might
have
taken
him
two
weeks
to
do
it
because
he
would
have
had
to
distinguish
the
stolen
coins
from
the
coins
that
would
be
found
on
the
premises.
he
knew
that
petitioner
was
a
coin
collector.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
they
do
sometimes,
and
the
reason
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it
varies
according
to
jurisdiction.
i
wouldn't
say
ordinarily
across
the
country,
no.
but
i
think
that
there
are
incentives
to
obtain
a
search
warrant
that
will
make
officers
get
them
at
time,
and
i
would
like
to
mention
some
of
those
to
the
court.
there
is
a
presumption
of
legality
that
attends
a
search
effected
by
a
search
warrant.
in
many
jurisdictions
and
in
california,
if
the
officer
does
not
have
a
search
warrant,
the
search
is
presumed
to
be
illegal
in
california
and
the
burden
is
on
the
prosecution
to
obtain
a
search
warrant,
a
justification
for
the
search.
it
must
show
that
there
was
probable
cause
and
that
the
search
was
incident
to
an
arrest.
secondly,
the
fact
that
there
was
a
search
warrant
will
insulate
the
officer
from
civil
and
criminal
liability
that
will
not
be
the
case
if
there
is
not
a
search
warrant.
finally,
or
rather
additionally,
there
is
also
an
opportunity
for
a
broader
search
if
there
is
a
search
warrant.
the
officer
will
be
able
to
search
outbuildings
and
throughout
the
premises
and
take
as
long
as
he
wants
if
he
has
a
search
warrant.
there
will
also
be
the
possibility
of
search
in
the
absence
of
the
suspect.
if
he
doesn't
arrest
the
suspect
at
the
house,
of
course,
he
couldn't
search
incident
to
an
arrest.
so
this
way,
with
a
search
warrant,
he
can
search
the
house
in
the
absence
of
the
defendant.
if
there
are
multiple
suspects,
as
there
often
are
in
narcotics
raids
or
other
conspiracy
crimes,
let's
say,
he
can
search
many
places.
the
police
force
can
simultaneously,
even
if
one
or
more
defendants
are
absent.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
without
the
arrest.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
because
the
officer
had
sufficient
information
to
make
the
most
basic
invasion
of
the
defendant's
privacy
that
one
can
imagine.
the
seizure
of
his
body.
now,
how
much
more
of
an
invasion
of
privacy
is
it
for
the
officer
to
also
seize
items
around
the
defendant?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
true,
but
you
could
have
searched
his
office.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
but
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that
it
was
maneuvered.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
there
are
various
justifications.
he
might
have
weapons
there.
he
might
try
to
destroy
evidence.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
of
that
sort.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
it's
different
from
a
--
for
a
television
theft
or
for
stolen
checks.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
correct.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes,
where
coins
could
have
been
hidden
and,
of
course,
it's
not
open
to
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
of
course,
that
would
support
the
officer's
not
having
to
leave
and
come
back
with
a
warrant
later.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
what
it
does
is,
the
practical
burden
that
would've
been
imposed
on
this
officer
to
describe
thousands
of
coins
with
sufficient
particularity,
as
would
be
required
under
this
court's
decision,
to
distinguish
them
from
the
defendant's
coins
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
marron.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
marron
describes
the
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
at
least
to
the
degree
necessary
to
distinguish
them
from
the
defendant's
own
coins,
which
the
officers
knew
would
be
on
the
premises
and
because
there
is
authority,
and
we
have
cited
it
in
our
brief,
that
the
description
must
be
adequate
to
segregate
lawful
property,
the
defendant's
own
property,
from
the
items
to
be
seized.
and
that
is
why
the
officer
did
not
get
a
search
warrant.
very
frankly,
off
the
record,
i
asked
the
officer,
“why
didn't
you,”
as
justice
marshall
asked,
“if
you
were
down
there
and
you
executed
this
affidavit
for
the
arrest
warrant,
why
didn't
you
also
get
a
search
warrant?”
and
that's
it.
he
didn't
want
to
get
a
search
warrant
that
would
get
knocked
out
if
it
just
described
the
coins
in
a
general
way.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
he
did.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
he
had
--
he
would
have
had
to
write
down
the
description
that
the
victim
told
him,
“well,
this
is
my
coin
because
it's
this
age,
and
maybe
it's
marked
up
this
way,
and
therefore
i
know
this
nickel
from
somebody
else's
nickel.”
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
would
have
been
quite
a
difficult
problem
and
the
officer
chose
to
have
the
coins
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
well,
both,
and
also
to
reduce
certain
conceptual
matters
to
writing.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
didn't
trouble
him,
because
he
left
coins
on
the
premises.
he
left
many,
many
coins.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
oh,
there
definitely
is.
it
would
have
been
an
impossible
task
for
him
to
do
it,
almost.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
considering
the
number
of
coins.
they
are
listed
in
our
appendix
here.
there
are
hundreds,
if
not
thousands,
of
coins
until
i
get
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
this
would've
been
an
unreasonable
burden
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
in
certain
situations
to
give
this
kind
of
a
description
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
would
be
like
describing
the
grains
of
sand
on
a
beach.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
the
officer
apparently
had
a
general
description,
at
least,
of
particular
types
of
coins
right
with
him,
and
if
he
saw
a
particular
container
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
pardon
me?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
it
might
not
have
been
sufficient.
of
course,
this
court
has
been
very
stringent.
if
you
don't
dot
your
“i's”
and
cross
your
“t's”
in
getting
the
search
warrant
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
he
thought
it
was
sufficient
information.
he
thought
that
it
would
have
been
very,
very
difficult
to
meet
this
burden
of
setting
it
all
out
in
writing
and
having
it
stand
up
and
he
thought
it
wasn't
necessary
in
view
of
this
court's
decisions
stretching
back
many,
many
years,
that
a
search
is
reasonable
if
it
is
incident
to
an
arrest.
that
is
why
he
thought
that
he
did
not
have
to.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
not
in
the
record.
no.
the
only
figure
related
to
that
is
the
number
of
burglary
investigations
that
officer
del
coma
himself
had
for
a
month,
but
the
number
of
search
warrants
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
i
have
only
a
letter
from
the
district
attorney's
office.
i
thought
the
court
might
be
interested
in
that
point
and
i
inquired.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
may
i
file
with
the
court
the
letter
that
i
received
from
the
district
attorney's
office?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
the
defendant,
prior
to
the
burglary
itself,
had
approached
the
victim
and
said,
“how
would
you
like
to
have
you
place
knocked
off,”
and
“do
you
carry
insurance,”
and
all
of
that.
shortly
before
the
burglary,
just
a
few
hours,
he
told
a
friend,
“i
have
a
big
job
going,
we're
going
to
knock
off
a
coin
shop,
maybe
$50,000
or
$60,000
are
involved.”
mr.
ronald
m.
george
a
coin
shop.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
then
shortly
afterwards,
he
told
the
same
friend,
“well,
we
broke
through
the
two
walls
and
we
came
across
the
wires,
but
we
didn't
really
go
through
with
the
job
completely.”
then
the
next
day
he
told
the
fellow,
“oh,
well
i
was
just
kidding
,don't
believe
what
i
said.”
then
he
told
another
person
after
the
burglary,
“i
am
involved
in
the
money
vault
burglary,
i
may
be
going
to
jail
on
that.”
then
he
negotiated
with
the
police
for
the
return
of
the
coins.
this
man
broadcast
all
over
town
that
he
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
for
the
return
of
the
coins,
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
he
and
another
suspect
and
an
attorney,
who
the
record
indicates
was
representing
both
suspects,
negotiated
for
the
return
of
the
coins
for
a
civil
release.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
at
the
police
station
so
this
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
guilt
and
the
probable
cause
was
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
i
can't
imagine
a
case
with
more.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
he
gave
a
very
unlikely
explanation.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
yes.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
for
one
minute
to
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
thank
you
very
much.
one
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
in
concluding
was
that
the
issue
here
under
the
rabinowitz
test
is
not
really
whether
or
not
it
is
the
police
officer
or
the
magistrate
who
is
to
make
the
decision
to
arrest
and
search;
but
rather,
whether
it
is
the
magistrate
who
will
decide
it
before
the
search
or
the
magistrate
after
the
search
because
of
course
as
this
court
has
noted,
it's
the
exclusionary
rule
which
is
the
most
effective
means
of
deterring
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
and
as
we
have
attempted
to
point
out
in
our
brief,
california
affords
many,
many
opportunities
at
all
stages
of
the
proceedings
to
invoke
the
exclusionary
rule
and
that
means
has
certainly
been
effective,
if
not
more
effective,
than
the
somewhat
cursory
examination
which
is
given
prior
to
issuing
a
search
warrant.
and
i
want
to
note
that
i
did
find
the
letter,
which
i'll
file
with
the
clerk.
it
does
not
cover
just
the
city
of
los
angeles.
it
covers
the
entire
county
of
los
angeles,
those
search
warrants
issued
by
the
district
attorney,
but
not
by
other
law
enforcement
agencies.
it
shows
that
a
total
of
225
search
warrant
issued
by
the
district
attorney
of
los
angeles
county
during
1968
and
--
mr.
ronald
m.
george
that
is
true,
yes.
approximately
seven
million
people
but
this
does
not
cover
the
various
other
law
enforcement
agencies
in
the
city
rather
in
the
county
which
have
also
issued
search
warrants.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
search
warrants?
mr.
ronald
m.
george
searches?
i
think
that's
a
fair
assumption.
mr.
ronald
m.
george
thank
you
your
honor.
