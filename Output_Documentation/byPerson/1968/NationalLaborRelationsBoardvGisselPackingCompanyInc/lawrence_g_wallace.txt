mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
raised
a
primary
contention
of
the
problem
of
reconciling
section
8
(a)
(1)
with
section
8
(c)
and
8
(a)
(1)
being
the
section,
one
of
the
sections
that
the
board
found
the
petitioner
to
have
violated.
these
are
set
forth
on
page
43
of
our
brief
in
the
appendix
and
perhaps,
that
is
a
good
starting
point
for
assessing
the
primary
contention
made
here.
under
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act,
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
interfere
with
restrain
or
coerce
employees
in
the
exercise
of
the
rights
guaranteed
in
section
7
including
the
right
to
a
free
choice
in
deciding
whether
they
want
to
select
a
representative
to
represent
them
in
collective
bargaining.
under
section
8
(c)
of
the
act,
congress
has
said
that
the
expressing
event
of
the
views,
argument
or
opinion
are
the
dissemination
thereof
whether
in
written,
printed,
graphic
or
visual
form
shall
not
constitute
or
be
evidence
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
any
of
the
provisions
of
this
act
if
such
expression
contains
no
threat
of
reprisal
or
force
or
promise
of
benefit.
now,
read
together
and
in
the
light
of
their
legislative
history,
we
submit
that
congress
was
saying
two
things
in
including
both
of
these
provisions
in
the
act.
one
that
it
wished
to
guarantee
the
employer's
right
to
express
his
views
and
this
is
at
all
times
under
8
(c),
it's
not
restricted
to
the
period
of
the
election.
and
the
other
thing
is
that
congress
wanted
to
protect
the
employees
who
are
economically
dependent
of
the
employer
from
being
deprived
through
threat
of
reprisal
of
their
freedom
of
choice
in
the
exercise
of
their
right
to
choose
their
bargaining
representatives
and
to
bargain
collectively
if
they
so
desire.
this
prohibition
of
threats
of
reprisal
which
exists
in
the
act
as
an
integral
part
of
the
congress'
regulation
of
the
employment
relationship,
a
regulation
of
the
manner
in
which
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
will
be
established
under
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
my
view,
is
that
it
goes
further
as
would
be
indicated
in
decisions
of
this
court
and
other
areas
of
economic
regulation
where
there
is
not
a
provision
comparable
to
8
(c)
protecting
freedom
of
expression
in
the
relationship,
in
the
economic
relationship.
i
--
i
think
for
example,
a
federal
trade
commission
against
texaco
in
this
term
where
the
court
held
that
there
was
inherent
coercion
in
the
recommendation
by
texaco
to
its
dealers
of
a
particular
brand
of
tires,
batteries,
and
accessories.
certainly,
the
labor
board
could
not
go
this
far
in
the
face
of
8
(c)
as
the
trade
commission
did
with
this
court
sustaining
and
in
that
case,
in
a
similar
economic
context
except
for
the
differences
in
the
statutory
provision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
said
yesterday
that
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
labor
act
when
read
together
with
section
8
(c)
prohibits
the
employer
from
coercively
interfering
by
threat
of
reprisal
with
employee
free
choice
and
selecting
a
bargaining
representative.
now,
of
course,
congress
never
said
in
the
act
or
in
its
legislative
history
that
the
threat
of
reprisal
need
be
in
any
particular
form
of
words
or
that
it
need
be
confined
within
the
compass
of
a
single
communication
in
order
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
congress
was
concerned
with
substantial
rights
and
did
not
create
any
such
loopholes
in
this
act.
now,
in
this
case,
we
are
not
dealing
with
an
employer
who
was
so
ill-advised
as
to
threaten
his
employees
in
blatant,
unequivocal
terms,
but
the
board
also
has
a
responsibility
in
protecting
the
rights
that
congress
has
guaranteed
to
determine
whether
an
employer
who
is
carefully
avoided
the
utterance
of
any
specific
overt
threat
has
nevertheless
intimidated
his
employees
by
getting
the
message
across
in
the
totality
of
what
is
said
that
there
is
a
real
threat
of
company
reprisal
if
they
should
select
the
union.
in
assessing
whether
the
employer's
communications
where
calculated
to
have
that
effect
and
more
importantly,
whether
they
were
likely
to
be
understood
by
the
employees
of
such
a
threat.
the
board
of
course
tries
realistically
to
take
into
account
all
the
circumstances
including
any
factors
that
may
make
the
employees
especially
susceptible
to
employer
intimidation.
as
judge
hays
of
the
second
circuit
who
was
a
longtime
and
distinguished
scholar
of
labor
law
has
suggested
in
a
dissenting
opinion,
it
is
not
always
easy
for
those
of
us
who
are
in
a
profession
which
shows
no
signs
of
obsolescence
and
which
offers
a
wide
variety
of
employment
flexibility
to
appreciate
that
the
insecurities
of
workers
who
are
not
so
fortunately
situated
can
make
them
painfully
vulnerable
to
the
pressures
of
equivocal
or
veiled
threats
by
their
employers.
now,
one
additional
word
of
background
may
be
illuminating
before
turning
to
this
record,
the
particular
kind
of
threat
involved
in
this
case,
the
threat
of
plant
closure
has
long
been
recognized
as
one
of
the
most
flagrantly
coercive
and
destructive
of
employee
free
choice.
in
one
of
the
leading
opinions
in
this
entire
field,
franks
brothers
against
the
labor
board
in
volume
321
u.s.
in
a
unanimous
opinion
delivered
by
mr.
justice
black,
the
court
singled
plant
closure
offers
special
emphasis
in
the
following
language.
before
the
election
was
held,
petitioner
conducted
an
aggressive
campaign
against
the
union
even
to
the
extent
of
threatening
to
close
its
factory
if
the
union
won
the
election.
now,
part
of
the
record
which
the
board
was
dealing
within
this
case
is
cogently
summarized
i
believe
in
the
petitioner's
brief
and
i'd
like
to
read
a
few
short
sentences
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
5
and
top
of
page
6.
during
this
same
period,
1952
to
1965,
changes
were
made
in
weaving
industry
equipment.
the
company's
looms
were
automated
to
the
point
where
they
could
be
run
without
an
operator.
electric
clutches
and
fingers
were
added,
which
made
it
much
easier
to
operate
and
some
skills
formerly
needed
were
eliminated.
although
it
was
not
unusual
to
have
apprentices
in
1952,
the
situation
changed
in
the
industry
after
that
time
because
of
automation.
the
company
had
had
no
apprentices
since
1952.
the
question
then
was
whether
the
employer's
communications
to
this
group
of
employees
whose
skills
had
become
technologically
outmoded
to
a
substantial
degree
were
likely
to
have
had
a
coercive
effect
by
conveying
a
threat
of
reprisal.
now,
the
board
relied
on
the
purported
effect
of
these
communications
as
a
whole
rather
than
on
any
particular
statements
and
they
are
rather
diffusively
spread
over
the
record.
it's
difficult
to
present
in
the
course
of
an
oral
argument,
the
communications
as
a
whole,
but
i'll
attempt
to
make
a
quick
survey
of
them
relying
upon
the
board's
findings
in
its
opinion
at
first
in
the
distillation
that
it
made
of
these
communications
from
the
record.
if
i
can
begin
as
background
with
the
earlier
communications
starting
on
page
172
of
the
appendix
in
the
findings
and
they
were
findings
in
the
board's
opinion.
in
the
first
speech
made
to
all
of
the
employees
when
the
president
of
the
company
first
learned
of
the
union's
organizing
campaign
long
before
any
demand
for
recognition
had
been
made.
he
spoke
towards
the
bottom
of
page
172
of
the
company's
financial
condition
indicating
that
ever
since
the
last
strike,
the
shop
had
been
running
on
thin
ice.
he
emphasized
that
if
the
company
could
not
agree
to
the
union's
demands,
the
union's
only
weapon
is
a
strike
and
pointed
out
that
while
he
did
not
intend
to
close,
a
strike
could
lead
to
the
closing
of
the
plant.
he
also
told
the
group
that
the
wire
weavers
craft
was
a
small
one
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
them
to
find
other
jobs
because
it
was
not
like
finding
a
job
as
a
machinist
that
many
of
them
did
not
have
the
education
which
would
make
it
difficult
for
them
to
find
another
job
and
that
many
of
them
were
getting
too
old
to
go
out
and
find
new
jobs.
continuing
on
page
174,
he
said
that
he
did
not
think
the
lindsay
organization,
the
new
owners
was
going
to
be
concerned
if
through
contract
negotiations
with
the
union,
our
people
went
on
strike,
that
the
strike
could
close
respondent's
plant
and
nothing
would
prevent
lindsay
from
having
respondent's
weaving
worked
on
at
lindsay's
plant
in
ohio
and
mississippi.
he
also
stated
the
respondent
was
subject
to
foreign
competition
and
that
it
was
conceivable
that
if
the
plant
was
closed
under
any
circumstances,
that
some
of
the
work
would
go
to
foreign
companies
and
that
respondent
had
handled
foreign
wires
in
the
past.
he
pointed
out
that
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
look
around
holyoke
if
they
thought
a
strike
could
not
close
respondent's
plant.
now,
continuing
with
a
letter
sent
on
november
5th
to
all
of
the
employees
on
page
175,
in
the
text
of
this
letter,
he
said,
that
the
new
ownership
is
entrusted
in
profits
and
not
pressure.
they
have
no
ties
with
holyoke
or
massachusetts.
skipping
down,
“the
union
promises
you
a
lot
but
what
can
they
deliver
except
pressure,
the
threat
of
a
strike.”
he
then
stated
that,
“i
do
not
believe
the
threat
of
a
strike
will
cause
the
new
owners
any
loss
of
sleep.
however,
a
long
strike
would
be
bad
for
me
because
i
would
like
to
remain
in
holyoke.”
next,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
page
178
in
these
findings,
getting
into
the
period
within
30
days
before
the
election
upon
which
the
board
directly
rely
and
a
letter
of
november
30th
addressed
to
all
of
the
wire
weavers,
i'm
reading
from
page
178,
the
third
line.
this
letter
warns
that,
“a
strike
can
still
close
the
holyoke
plant,
but
other
plants
can
pick
up
the
work,
and
that
the
new
ownership
is
entrusted
in
profits
and
not
pressure.”
he
then
points
out
that
the
teamsters
union
cannot
do
anything
to
improve
our
profit
position,
but
can
only
make
big
demands
which
the
company
cannot
meet,
and
the
call
you
out
on
strike
because
a
strike
is
a
union's
only
weapon
to
enforce
its
big
demands.
he
then
asks,
“can
you
afford
a
long
strike
when
you
know
the
holyoke
plant
has
been
given
a
second
chance
to
stay
in
the
business
and
furnish
jobs
for
all
of
us?”
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
directly
to
the
employer's
last
communications
during
the
two
days
before
the
election.
first
of
all,
a
leaflet
which
was
distributed
to
the
wire
weavers
two
days
before
the
election
in
which
appears
on
page
137
of
the
appendix
in
a
foldout,
it
begins
you'll
note
on
page
137
of
the
appendix
with
a
cartoon
showing
a
grave
being
prepared
for
the
sinclair
company,
surrounded
by
tombstones
marked
with
the
names
of
other
companies
in
the
area
that
had
closed
down.
and
underneath
the
cartoon,
among
the
comments
is
the
statement,
the
holyoke-springfield
industrial
graveyard
is
filled
with
companies
which
died
under
union
pressure.
and
then
on
the
next
page,
on
the
reverse
side,
in
the
first
column
under
the
heading,
many
were
sick
when
the
union
doctor
came
in,
it
says,
“some
of
the
industrial
corpses
were
already
sick
when
the
unions
came
in
with
big
promises
to
the
employees
of
what
the
unions
could
do
for
them.
these
companies
needed
higher
production
and
better
quality
to
meet
the
stiffer
competition.
the
union
doctors
gave
them
bloodletting
strikes
restricted
production
and
a
higher
labor
cost.
the
result
as
you
see
as
you
look
around
was
the
death
of
these
companies.”
then
on
the
following
page
which
continues
the
leaflet,
page
139,
under
the
caption
our
history
is
not
bright
against
the
background
such
as
ours,
your
dreams
of
union
miracles
can
be
dangerous
to
your
real
job
security.
we
don't
know
what
the
future
holds
for
any
of
us,
but
you
can
be
sure
the
new
owners
of
sinclair
company
were
looking
for
profits
and
not
operation
holyoke
rat
hole
into
which
to
pour
dollars
without
hope
of
profit.
and
then
the
final
page,
pictures
five
factories
in
the
area
which
have
closed
down
with
the
--
among
the
captions,
unions
furnished
no
job
security
here.
in
testimony
however,
on
pages
40
and
41
of
the
appendix,
the
employer
admitted
that
he
had
no
basis
for
believing
that
unions
or
union
activities
had
had
anything
to
do
with
the
closing
of
any
of
these
plants,
despite
the
representations
in
this
leaflet.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
had
been
a
union
prior
to
1952,
an
independent
union
which
is
now
affiliated
with
the
teamsters
and
wire
weaving
union.
there
had
been
a
13-week
strike.
after
which,
the
plant
reopened
on
a
non-union
basis
until
this
present
controversy
in
1965.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
before
the
--
a
company
was
sold
to
lindsay
wire
weaving,
but
the
president
of
sinclair,
the
wholly-owned
subsidiary
is
the
same
man
who
is
the
manager
when
it
was
an
independent
company.
it's
the
son
of
the
founder.
now,
finally,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
note
cards
introduced
into
evidence
by
the
company
which
were
the
basis
of
the
final
speech
to
the
wire
weavers
on
the
day
before
the
election.
these
begin
on
page
162
of
the
appendix,
and
i
would
like
to
naturally
read
selectively
in
the
limited
time
we
have.
beginning
on
page
163
in
the
middle
of
card
5,
“what
can
they
do?”
meaning
the
union,
demand
higher
wages
and
expensive
welfare
and
pension
plans
which
could
lead
to
even
larger
losses
than
we
have
had.
although
on
page
69
of
the
record,
i
might
point
out
president
sinclair
testified
that
the
company
made
a
profit
in
fiscal
year
1965
not
losses,
can
call
you
out
on
strike,
you
people
know
what
it
is
like,
you
have
had
strike
experience,
i
don't
think
our
new
ownership
will
lose
a
minute
sleep
over
whether
the
union
threatens
the
company
with
a
strike.
they
have
made
it
clear
to
me
that
they
look
for
profit
and
not
a
hole
to
pour
money
down.
if
we
have
to
negotiate
with
the
teamsters
and
cannot
reach
agreement
on
a
contract
under
which
we
can
money,
they
could
care
less
about
the
threat
of
strike.
and
continuing
on
the
next
page
in
the
middle
of
card
9,
"now,
i
would
be
the
last
one
to
blacklist
you
for
getting
another
job
if
this
plant
close
by
strike,
but
the
teamsters
can't
guarantee
you
another
job
either."
again,
let's
look
at
facts
head-on,
no
one
likes
to
admit
his
getting
older.
we
are
all
jack
benny's,
we're
never
going
to
be
over
39,
but
we
don't
look
that
way
to
an
employment
manager.
most
companies
probably
have
a
large
number
of
applicants,
who
are
young,
have
better
educations
and
certainly,
a
lot
better
insurance
rating
than
you
and
i.
they
can
be
hired
for
a
lot
less
money,
who
you
have
experience,
but
it
is
limited
to
a
particular
small
craft.
i
have
assumed
in
case
we
are
force
to
shutdown
because
of
a
strike
that
some
other
plant
will
pick
up
your
business,
our
business,
excuse
me.
this
is
not
necessarily
so.
pressure
is
still
on
from
foreign
wire
weavers.
maybe
three
months
from
now,
i'll
force
to
sell
foreign
wires
if
the
teamsters
union
stops
our
production.
you
all
know
we
have
had
to
handle
foreign
wires
in
the
past.
then
on
the
next
page
at
the
end
of
card
12,
“i
have
given
you
the
facts
today
and
by
mailings
as
i
know
them
to
be,
it's
not
a
rosy
picture
for
you
or
for
me.
now,
the
decision
is
up
to
you.
perhaps,
you
feel
i'm
exaggerating
or
bluffing.
i'm
deadly
serious
and
i'm
deeply
concerned.”
and
the
final
sentence,
“to
you
and
your
dependents,
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
elections
in
which
you'll
ever
vote.”
we
believe
that
on
this
record,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
community
and
this
audience,
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
held
that
it
was
permissible,
perhaps
not
required
but
permissible
for
the
board
to
conclude
that
the
atmosphere
of
free
choice
which
congress
has
ordained
for
representation
election
had
been
undermined
by
an
implied
threat,
a
threat
that
the
employer
anticipated
that
it
would
not
be
able
to
agree
to
a
contract
with
the
union,
and
anticipated
making
other
arrangements
for
its
wire
weaving
needs,
if
the
union
should
win
the
election
that
this
would
lead
either
to
the
closure
of
the
plant
or
in
the
transfer
of
the
wire
weaving
operations
elsewhere.
under
the
act,
this
was
a
judgment
for
the
board
to
make,
subject
of
course
to
the
safeguards
of
judicial
review.
it
is
the
sort
of
judgment
that
the
board
has
required
to
make
in
a
very
large
number
of
cases
every
year.
for
example,
during
the
fiscal
1967,
more
than
8,000
representation
elections
were
conducted
by
the
board,
and
during
the
same
year,
objections
were
filed
with
the
board
to
1,369
such
elections.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
am,
your
honor,
in
just
a
moment
if
i
may.
in
evaluating
such
objections,
the
board
has
shown
appropriate
solicitude
for
the
statutory
rights
of
employers
under
section
8
(c)
to
express
their
views
during
the
campaign.
for
example
in
a
1966
decision
concerning
ameray's
corporation
in
volume
162
of
the
nlrb
reports.
the
board
held
that
that
following
inaccurate
and
intemperate
criticism
of
the
union
was
privilege
under
this
section,
a
statement
by
a
supervisor
that
the
company
did
not
want
the
union
end
that
quote
“all
they
was
good
for
was
blowing
up
people's
houses
and
kidnapping
their
kids
and
that
they
was
rammed
by
nothing
but
a
bunch
of
gangsters.”
the
board's
decision
also
have
upheld
the
right
of
an
employer
to
explain
realistically
to
his
employees
that
his
business
situation
is
unfavorable
and
precludes
increases
in
their
compensation
or
other
benefits,
so
long
as
this
is
done
in
a
non-coercive
way.
the
employees
in
such
a
situation
might
still
wish
to
select
a
bargaining
representative
to
protect
them
against
reductions
of
benefits
or
loss
of
employment.
of
course,
we
do
not
claim
that
the
board
has
been
infallible
in
its
judgments
in
every
one
of
the
many
cases
requiring
it
to
draw
the
line
between
a
protected
expressions
of
views
and
implied
threats,
but
we
do
claim
that
in
the
present
case,
the
board's
conclusion
was
an
unremarkable
one.
it
was
a
clearly
warranted
implementation
of
the
congressional
mandate
for
protection
of
employee
free
choice
from
the
threat
of
economic
coercion
by
the
employer.
and
indeed,
we
think
the
case
would
become
remarkable
only
if
this
court
were
to
convert
this
record
into
a
script
which
thereafter
could
be
used
by
employers
with
impunity
to
intimidate
their
employees.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
mean
if
the
holding
word
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
mean
that
if
this
record
would
be
published
and
i'm
certain,
it
would
be
use
in
counseling
as
to
representations
that
could
be
made
in
the
course
of
this
campaigns,
and
as
to
which
the
board
could
not
make
a
judgment
that
the
coercion
unlawfully
had
occurred.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course,
that's
true.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
another
way
of
telling
it.
that's
--
that
is
quite
correct.
of
course,
that
is
--
it's
exactly
the
point
i
meant
to
make.
now,
once
it
is
decided,
it
was
decided
in
this
case
that
wrongful
coercion
by
the
employer
to
stride
the
accuracy
of
the
elective
process
as
a
measure
of
employee's
sentiment,
the
board's
remedy
of
a
bargaining
order,
it
seems
to
me
became
plainly
warranted
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
union
had
made
a
very
strong
showing
of
employee
support
by
obtaining
authorization
cards
from
a
large
majority
of
the
employees;
11
of
the
total
of
14
in
the
bargaining
unit.
the
authenticity
of
these
cards
is
no
longer
disputed
and
the
employer
never
disputed
the
authenticity
of
eight
of
them.
no
claim
has
been
made
that
they
were
obtained
by
misrepresentation
or
coercion,
the
cards
themselves
which
are
in
the
appendix
on
page
109
unequivocally
designate
the
union
as
bargaining
representative
and
include
an
application
for
membership
in
the
union.
in
these
circumstances,
the
employer's
coercive
power
during
the
election
campaign
permitted
the
board,
and
it
does
not
always
draw
this
inference
but
it
permitted
the
board
to
infer
that
the
employer's
refusal
to
bargain
in
response
to
the
union's
request
based
on
the
cards
was
motivated
not
by
good
faith
doubt
as
to
the
union's
majority
status,
but
motivated
primarily
by
a
desire
to
try
by
wrongful
means
to
dissipate
that
majority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
that
--
what
i
just
spoke
of
was
the
basis
for
the
board's
finding
of
an
8
(a)
(5)
violation,
a
refusal
to
bargain
for
which
a
bargaining
order
is
always
the
appropriate
remedy.
the
board
held
moreover
in
this
case
that
even
in
the
absence
of
the
finding
of
an
8
(a)
(5)
violation,
the
bargaining
order
would
have
been
an
appropriate
remedy
for
the
8
(a)
(1)
violation
and
is
so
indicated
by
the
franks
brothers
case
with
i
referred
to
in
320
u.s.
in
which
this
court
said
that
the
board
had
lost
its
--
that
the
union
had
lost
its
majority
because
of
the
employer's
coercive
threats.
and
nonetheless,
upheld
unanimously
the
bargaining
order
based
on
the
authorization
cards.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
in
321
u.s.
and
it
was
under
the
wagner
act
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
because
the
employer's
8
(a)
(1)
violation
in
this
case
could
not
readily
be
cured
so
as
to
restore
the
conditions
necessary
for
an
election
free
from
the
effects
of
his
wrongful
coercion.
the
board
was
warranted
in
relying
on
the
decisive
majority
indicated
by
the
cards
at
a
more
accurate
showing
of
employees'
sentiment
that
an
election
would
be
in
the
existing
circumstances,
and
thus
to
decide
that
the
requested
right
of
the
employees
to
bargain
collectively
should
be
enforced
without
further
delay.
now,
this
is
not
a
drastic
remedy
because
as
in
the
case
of
any
bargaining
order,
there
will
be
opportunities
for
interested
persons
to
request
another
election
to
measure
any
changes
in
employees
sentiment
after
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
in
sum,
therefore,
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
was
entirely
correct
in
treating
this
case
as
a
rather
routine
example
of
the
board's
proper
discharge
of
its
statutory
responsibilities,
which
is
the
flavor
one
gets
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
reviewing
this
record.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
to
my
knowledge,
although
there
have
been
relatively
few
cases
in
which
the
only
wrongful
conduct,
the
only
unfair
labor
practice
was
in
implied
threats
or
coercion,
without
any
wrongful
interrogations
or
wrongful
discharges.
there
are
two
seventh
circuit
cases
upholding
the
board
in
such
situations
that
are
cited
in
our
brief,
and
those
are
the
only
ones
that
i
know
of
other
than
this
decision
from
the
first
circuit,
upholding
an
order
based
exclusively
on
this
kind
of
unfair
labor
practice.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
raised
a
primary
contention
of
the
problem
of
reconciling
section
8
(a)
(1)
with
section
8
(c)
and
8
(a)
(1)
being
the
section,
one
of
the
sections
that
the
board
found
the
petitioner
to
have
violated.
these
are
set
forth
on
page
43
of
our
brief
in
the
appendix
and
perhaps,
that
is
a
good
starting
point
for
assessing
the
primary
contention
made
here.
under
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
act,
it
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
interfere
with
restrain
or
coerce
employees
in
the
exercise
of
the
rights
guaranteed
in
section
7
including
the
right
to
a
free
choice
in
deciding
whether
they
want
to
select
a
representative
to
represent
them
in
collective
bargaining.
under
section
8
(c)
of
the
act,
congress
has
said
that
the
expressing
event
of
the
views,
argument
or
opinion
are
the
dissemination
thereof
whether
in
written,
printed,
graphic
or
visual
form
shall
not
constitute
or
be
evidence
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
any
of
the
provisions
of
this
act
if
such
expression
contains
no
threat
of
reprisal
or
force
or
promise
of
benefit.
now,
read
together
and
in
the
light
of
their
legislative
history,
we
submit
that
congress
was
saying
two
things
in
including
both
of
these
provisions
in
the
act.
one
that
it
wished
to
guarantee
the
employer's
right
to
express
his
views
and
this
is
at
all
times
under
8
(c),
it's
not
restricted
to
the
period
of
the
election.
and
the
other
thing
is
that
congress
wanted
to
protect
the
employees
who
are
economically
dependent
of
the
employer
from
being
deprived
through
threat
of
reprisal
of
their
freedom
of
choice
in
the
exercise
of
their
right
to
choose
their
bargaining
representatives
and
to
bargain
collectively
if
they
so
desire.
this
prohibition
of
threats
of
reprisal
which
exists
in
the
act
as
an
integral
part
of
the
congress'
regulation
of
the
employment
relationship,
a
regulation
of
the
manner
in
which
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
will
be
established
under
the
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
my
view,
is
that
it
goes
further
as
would
be
indicated
in
decisions
of
this
court
and
other
areas
of
economic
regulation
where
there
is
not
a
provision
comparable
to
8
(c)
protecting
freedom
of
expression
in
the
relationship,
in
the
economic
relationship.
i
--
i
think
for
example,
a
federal
trade
commission
against
texaco
in
this
term
where
the
court
held
that
there
was
inherent
coercion
in
the
recommendation
by
texaco
to
its
dealers
of
a
particular
brand
of
tires,
batteries,
and
accessories.
certainly,
the
labor
board
could
not
go
this
far
in
the
face
of
8
(c)
as
the
trade
commission
did
with
this
court
sustaining
and
in
that
case,
in
a
similar
economic
context
except
for
the
differences
in
the
statutory
provision.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
said
yesterday
that
section
8
(a)
(1)
of
the
labor
act
when
read
together
with
section
8
(c)
prohibits
the
employer
from
coercively
interfering
by
threat
of
reprisal
with
employee
free
choice
and
selecting
a
bargaining
representative.
now,
of
course,
congress
never
said
in
the
act
or
in
its
legislative
history
that
the
threat
of
reprisal
need
be
in
any
particular
form
of
words
or
that
it
need
be
confined
within
the
compass
of
a
single
communication
in
order
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
congress
was
concerned
with
substantial
rights
and
did
not
create
any
such
loopholes
in
this
act.
now,
in
this
case,
we
are
not
dealing
with
an
employer
who
was
so
ill-advised
as
to
threaten
his
employees
in
blatant,
unequivocal
terms,
but
the
board
also
has
a
responsibility
in
protecting
the
rights
that
congress
has
guaranteed
to
determine
whether
an
employer
who
is
carefully
avoided
the
utterance
of
any
specific
overt
threat
has
nevertheless
intimidated
his
employees
by
getting
the
message
across
in
the
totality
of
what
is
said
that
there
is
a
real
threat
of
company
reprisal
if
they
should
select
the
union.
in
assessing
whether
the
employer's
communications
where
calculated
to
have
that
effect
and
more
importantly,
whether
they
were
likely
to
be
understood
by
the
employees
of
such
a
threat.
the
board
of
course
tries
realistically
to
take
into
account
all
the
circumstances
including
any
factors
that
may
make
the
employees
especially
susceptible
to
employer
intimidation.
as
judge
hays
of
the
second
circuit
who
was
a
longtime
and
distinguished
scholar
of
labor
law
has
suggested
in
a
dissenting
opinion,
it
is
not
always
easy
for
those
of
us
who
are
in
a
profession
which
shows
no
signs
of
obsolescence
and
which
offers
a
wide
variety
of
employment
flexibility
to
appreciate
that
the
insecurities
of
workers
who
are
not
so
fortunately
situated
can
make
them
painfully
vulnerable
to
the
pressures
of
equivocal
or
veiled
threats
by
their
employers.
now,
one
additional
word
of
background
may
be
illuminating
before
turning
to
this
record,
the
particular
kind
of
threat
involved
in
this
case,
the
threat
of
plant
closure
has
long
been
recognized
as
one
of
the
most
flagrantly
coercive
and
destructive
of
employee
free
choice.
in
one
of
the
leading
opinions
in
this
entire
field,
franks
brothers
against
the
labor
board
in
volume
321
u.s.
in
a
unanimous
opinion
delivered
by
mr.
justice
black,
the
court
singled
plant
closure
offers
special
emphasis
in
the
following
language.
before
the
election
was
held,
petitioner
conducted
an
aggressive
campaign
against
the
union
even
to
the
extent
of
threatening
to
close
its
factory
if
the
union
won
the
election.
now,
part
of
the
record
which
the
board
was
dealing
within
this
case
is
cogently
summarized
i
believe
in
the
petitioner's
brief
and
i'd
like
to
read
a
few
short
sentences
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
5
and
top
of
page
6.
during
this
same
period,
1952
to
1965,
changes
were
made
in
weaving
industry
equipment.
the
company's
looms
were
automated
to
the
point
where
they
could
be
run
without
an
operator.
electric
clutches
and
fingers
were
added,
which
made
it
much
easier
to
operate
and
some
skills
formerly
needed
were
eliminated.
although
it
was
not
unusual
to
have
apprentices
in
1952,
the
situation
changed
in
the
industry
after
that
time
because
of
automation.
the
company
had
had
no
apprentices
since
1952.
the
question
then
was
whether
the
employer's
communications
to
this
group
of
employees
whose
skills
had
become
technologically
outmoded
to
a
substantial
degree
were
likely
to
have
had
a
coercive
effect
by
conveying
a
threat
of
reprisal.
now,
the
board
relied
on
the
purported
effect
of
these
communications
as
a
whole
rather
than
on
any
particular
statements
and
they
are
rather
diffusively
spread
over
the
record.
it's
difficult
to
present
in
the
course
of
an
oral
argument,
the
communications
as
a
whole,
but
i'll
attempt
to
make
a
quick
survey
of
them
relying
upon
the
board's
findings
in
its
opinion
at
first
in
the
distillation
that
it
made
of
these
communications
from
the
record.
if
i
can
begin
as
background
with
the
earlier
communications
starting
on
page
172
of
the
appendix
in
the
findings
and
they
were
findings
in
the
board's
opinion.
in
the
first
speech
made
to
all
of
the
employees
when
the
president
of
the
company
first
learned
of
the
union's
organizing
campaign
long
before
any
demand
for
recognition
had
been
made.
he
spoke
towards
the
bottom
of
page
172
of
the
company's
financial
condition
indicating
that
ever
since
the
last
strike,
the
shop
had
been
running
on
thin
ice.
he
emphasized
that
if
the
company
could
not
agree
to
the
union's
demands,
the
union's
only
weapon
is
a
strike
and
pointed
out
that
while
he
did
not
intend
to
close,
a
strike
could
lead
to
the
closing
of
the
plant.
he
also
told
the
group
that
the
wire
weavers
craft
was
a
small
one
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
them
to
find
other
jobs
because
it
was
not
like
finding
a
job
as
a
machinist
that
many
of
them
did
not
have
the
education
which
would
make
it
difficult
for
them
to
find
another
job
and
that
many
of
them
were
getting
too
old
to
go
out
and
find
new
jobs.
continuing
on
page
174,
he
said
that
he
did
not
think
the
lindsay
organization,
the
new
owners
was
going
to
be
concerned
if
through
contract
negotiations
with
the
union,
our
people
went
on
strike,
that
the
strike
could
close
respondent's
plant
and
nothing
would
prevent
lindsay
from
having
respondent's
weaving
worked
on
at
lindsay's
plant
in
ohio
and
mississippi.
he
also
stated
the
respondent
was
subject
to
foreign
competition
and
that
it
was
conceivable
that
if
the
plant
was
closed
under
any
circumstances,
that
some
of
the
work
would
go
to
foreign
companies
and
that
respondent
had
handled
foreign
wires
in
the
past.
he
pointed
out
that
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
look
around
holyoke
if
they
thought
a
strike
could
not
close
respondent's
plant.
now,
continuing
with
a
letter
sent
on
november
5th
to
all
of
the
employees
on
page
175,
in
the
text
of
this
letter,
he
said,
that
the
new
ownership
is
entrusted
in
profits
and
not
pressure.
they
have
no
ties
with
holyoke
or
massachusetts.
skipping
down,
“the
union
promises
you
a
lot
but
what
can
they
deliver
except
pressure,
the
threat
of
a
strike.”
he
then
stated
that,
“i
do
not
believe
the
threat
of
a
strike
will
cause
the
new
owners
any
loss
of
sleep.
however,
a
long
strike
would
be
bad
for
me
because
i
would
like
to
remain
in
holyoke.”
next,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
page
178
in
these
findings,
getting
into
the
period
within
30
days
before
the
election
upon
which
the
board
directly
rely
and
a
letter
of
november
30th
addressed
to
all
of
the
wire
weavers,
i'm
reading
from
page
178,
the
third
line.
this
letter
warns
that,
“a
strike
can
still
close
the
holyoke
plant,
but
other
plants
can
pick
up
the
work,
and
that
the
new
ownership
is
entrusted
in
profits
and
not
pressure.”
he
then
points
out
that
the
teamsters
union
cannot
do
anything
to
improve
our
profit
position,
but
can
only
make
big
demands
which
the
company
cannot
meet,
and
the
call
you
out
on
strike
because
a
strike
is
a
union's
only
weapon
to
enforce
its
big
demands.
he
then
asks,
“can
you
afford
a
long
strike
when
you
know
the
holyoke
plant
has
been
given
a
second
chance
to
stay
in
the
business
and
furnish
jobs
for
all
of
us?”
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
directly
to
the
employer's
last
communications
during
the
two
days
before
the
election.
first
of
all,
a
leaflet
which
was
distributed
to
the
wire
weavers
two
days
before
the
election
in
which
appears
on
page
137
of
the
appendix
in
a
foldout,
it
begins
you'll
note
on
page
137
of
the
appendix
with
a
cartoon
showing
a
grave
being
prepared
for
the
sinclair
company,
surrounded
by
tombstones
marked
with
the
names
of
other
companies
in
the
area
that
had
closed
down.
and
underneath
the
cartoon,
among
the
comments
is
the
statement,
the
holyoke-springfield
industrial
graveyard
is
filled
with
companies
which
died
under
union
pressure.
and
then
on
the
next
page,
on
the
reverse
side,
in
the
first
column
under
the
heading,
many
were
sick
when
the
union
doctor
came
in,
it
says,
“some
of
the
industrial
corpses
were
already
sick
when
the
unions
came
in
with
big
promises
to
the
employees
of
what
the
unions
could
do
for
them.
these
companies
needed
higher
production
and
better
quality
to
meet
the
stiffer
competition.
the
union
doctors
gave
them
bloodletting
strikes
restricted
production
and
a
higher
labor
cost.
the
result
as
you
see
as
you
look
around
was
the
death
of
these
companies.”
then
on
the
following
page
which
continues
the
leaflet,
page
139,
under
the
caption
our
history
is
not
bright
against
the
background
such
as
ours,
your
dreams
of
union
miracles
can
be
dangerous
to
your
real
job
security.
we
don't
know
what
the
future
holds
for
any
of
us,
but
you
can
be
sure
the
new
owners
of
sinclair
company
were
looking
for
profits
and
not
operation
holyoke
rat
hole
into
which
to
pour
dollars
without
hope
of
profit.
and
then
the
final
page,
pictures
five
factories
in
the
area
which
have
closed
down
with
the
--
among
the
captions,
unions
furnished
no
job
security
here.
in
testimony
however,
on
pages
40
and
41
of
the
appendix,
the
employer
admitted
that
he
had
no
basis
for
believing
that
unions
or
union
activities
had
had
anything
to
do
with
the
closing
of
any
of
these
plants,
despite
the
representations
in
this
leaflet.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
had
been
a
union
prior
to
1952,
an
independent
union
which
is
now
affiliated
with
the
teamsters
and
wire
weaving
union.
there
had
been
a
13-week
strike.
after
which,
the
plant
reopened
on
a
non-union
basis
until
this
present
controversy
in
1965.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
before
the
--
a
company
was
sold
to
lindsay
wire
weaving,
but
the
president
of
sinclair,
the
wholly-owned
subsidiary
is
the
same
man
who
is
the
manager
when
it
was
an
independent
company.
it's
the
son
of
the
founder.
now,
finally,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
note
cards
introduced
into
evidence
by
the
company
which
were
the
basis
of
the
final
speech
to
the
wire
weavers
on
the
day
before
the
election.
these
begin
on
page
162
of
the
appendix,
and
i
would
like
to
naturally
read
selectively
in
the
limited
time
we
have.
beginning
on
page
163
in
the
middle
of
card
5,
“what
can
they
do?”
meaning
the
union,
demand
higher
wages
and
expensive
welfare
and
pension
plans
which
could
lead
to
even
larger
losses
than
we
have
had.
although
on
page
69
of
the
record,
i
might
point
out
president
sinclair
testified
that
the
company
made
a
profit
in
fiscal
year
1965
not
losses,
can
call
you
out
on
strike,
you
people
know
what
it
is
like,
you
have
had
strike
experience,
i
don't
think
our
new
ownership
will
lose
a
minute
sleep
over
whether
the
union
threatens
the
company
with
a
strike.
they
have
made
it
clear
to
me
that
they
look
for
profit
and
not
a
hole
to
pour
money
down.
if
we
have
to
negotiate
with
the
teamsters
and
cannot
reach
agreement
on
a
contract
under
which
we
can
money,
they
could
care
less
about
the
threat
of
strike.
and
continuing
on
the
next
page
in
the
middle
of
card
9,
"now,
i
would
be
the
last
one
to
blacklist
you
for
getting
another
job
if
this
plant
close
by
strike,
but
the
teamsters
can't
guarantee
you
another
job
either."
again,
let's
look
at
facts
head-on,
no
one
likes
to
admit
his
getting
older.
we
are
all
jack
benny's,
we're
never
going
to
be
over
39,
but
we
don't
look
that
way
to
an
employment
manager.
most
companies
probably
have
a
large
number
of
applicants,
who
are
young,
have
better
educations
and
certainly,
a
lot
better
insurance
rating
than
you
and
i.
they
can
be
hired
for
a
lot
less
money,
who
you
have
experience,
but
it
is
limited
to
a
particular
small
craft.
i
have
assumed
in
case
we
are
force
to
shutdown
because
of
a
strike
that
some
other
plant
will
pick
up
your
business,
our
business,
excuse
me.
this
is
not
necessarily
so.
pressure
is
still
on
from
foreign
wire
weavers.
maybe
three
months
from
now,
i'll
force
to
sell
foreign
wires
if
the
teamsters
union
stops
our
production.
you
all
know
we
have
had
to
handle
foreign
wires
in
the
past.
then
on
the
next
page
at
the
end
of
card
12,
“i
have
given
you
the
facts
today
and
by
mailings
as
i
know
them
to
be,
it's
not
a
rosy
picture
for
you
or
for
me.
now,
the
decision
is
up
to
you.
perhaps,
you
feel
i'm
exaggerating
or
bluffing.
i'm
deadly
serious
and
i'm
deeply
concerned.”
and
the
final
sentence,
“to
you
and
your
dependents,
this
is
one
of
the
most
important
elections
in
which
you'll
ever
vote.”
we
believe
that
on
this
record,
in
the
circumstances
of
this
community
and
this
audience,
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
held
that
it
was
permissible,
perhaps
not
required
but
permissible
for
the
board
to
conclude
that
the
atmosphere
of
free
choice
which
congress
has
ordained
for
representation
election
had
been
undermined
by
an
implied
threat,
a
threat
that
the
employer
anticipated
that
it
would
not
be
able
to
agree
to
a
contract
with
the
union,
and
anticipated
making
other
arrangements
for
its
wire
weaving
needs,
if
the
union
should
win
the
election
that
this
would
lead
either
to
the
closure
of
the
plant
or
in
the
transfer
of
the
wire
weaving
operations
elsewhere.
under
the
act,
this
was
a
judgment
for
the
board
to
make,
subject
of
course
to
the
safeguards
of
judicial
review.
it
is
the
sort
of
judgment
that
the
board
has
required
to
make
in
a
very
large
number
of
cases
every
year.
for
example,
during
the
fiscal
1967,
more
than
8,000
representation
elections
were
conducted
by
the
board,
and
during
the
same
year,
objections
were
filed
with
the
board
to
1,369
such
elections.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
am,
your
honor,
in
just
a
moment
if
i
may.
in
evaluating
such
objections,
the
board
has
shown
appropriate
solicitude
for
the
statutory
rights
of
employers
under
section
8
(c)
to
express
their
views
during
the
campaign.
for
example
in
a
1966
decision
concerning
ameray's
corporation
in
volume
162
of
the
nlrb
reports.
the
board
held
that
that
following
inaccurate
and
intemperate
criticism
of
the
union
was
privilege
under
this
section,
a
statement
by
a
supervisor
that
the
company
did
not
want
the
union
end
that
quote
“all
they
was
good
for
was
blowing
up
people's
houses
and
kidnapping
their
kids
and
that
they
was
rammed
by
nothing
but
a
bunch
of
gangsters.”
the
board's
decision
also
have
upheld
the
right
of
an
employer
to
explain
realistically
to
his
employees
that
his
business
situation
is
unfavorable
and
precludes
increases
in
their
compensation
or
other
benefits,
so
long
as
this
is
done
in
a
non-coercive
way.
the
employees
in
such
a
situation
might
still
wish
to
select
a
bargaining
representative
to
protect
them
against
reductions
of
benefits
or
loss
of
employment.
of
course,
we
do
not
claim
that
the
board
has
been
infallible
in
its
judgments
in
every
one
of
the
many
cases
requiring
it
to
draw
the
line
between
a
protected
expressions
of
views
and
implied
threats,
but
we
do
claim
that
in
the
present
case,
the
board's
conclusion
was
an
unremarkable
one.
it
was
a
clearly
warranted
implementation
of
the
congressional
mandate
for
protection
of
employee
free
choice
from
the
threat
of
economic
coercion
by
the
employer.
and
indeed,
we
think
the
case
would
become
remarkable
only
if
this
court
were
to
convert
this
record
into
a
script
which
thereafter
could
be
used
by
employers
with
impunity
to
intimidate
their
employees.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
mean
if
the
holding
word
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
mean
that
if
this
record
would
be
published
and
i'm
certain,
it
would
be
use
in
counseling
as
to
representations
that
could
be
made
in
the
course
of
this
campaigns,
and
as
to
which
the
board
could
not
make
a
judgment
that
the
coercion
unlawfully
had
occurred.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course,
that's
true.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
another
way
of
telling
it.
that's
--
that
is
quite
correct.
of
course,
that
is
--
it's
exactly
the
point
i
meant
to
make.
now,
once
it
is
decided,
it
was
decided
in
this
case
that
wrongful
coercion
by
the
employer
to
stride
the
accuracy
of
the
elective
process
as
a
measure
of
employee's
sentiment,
the
board's
remedy
of
a
bargaining
order,
it
seems
to
me
became
plainly
warranted
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
union
had
made
a
very
strong
showing
of
employee
support
by
obtaining
authorization
cards
from
a
large
majority
of
the
employees;
11
of
the
total
of
14
in
the
bargaining
unit.
the
authenticity
of
these
cards
is
no
longer
disputed
and
the
employer
never
disputed
the
authenticity
of
eight
of
them.
no
claim
has
been
made
that
they
were
obtained
by
misrepresentation
or
coercion,
the
cards
themselves
which
are
in
the
appendix
on
page
109
unequivocally
designate
the
union
as
bargaining
representative
and
include
an
application
for
membership
in
the
union.
in
these
circumstances,
the
employer's
coercive
power
during
the
election
campaign
permitted
the
board,
and
it
does
not
always
draw
this
inference
but
it
permitted
the
board
to
infer
that
the
employer's
refusal
to
bargain
in
response
to
the
union's
request
based
on
the
cards
was
motivated
not
by
good
faith
doubt
as
to
the
union's
majority
status,
but
motivated
primarily
by
a
desire
to
try
by
wrongful
means
to
dissipate
that
majority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
that
--
what
i
just
spoke
of
was
the
basis
for
the
board's
finding
of
an
8
(a)
(5)
violation,
a
refusal
to
bargain
for
which
a
bargaining
order
is
always
the
appropriate
remedy.
the
board
held
moreover
in
this
case
that
even
in
the
absence
of
the
finding
of
an
8
(a)
(5)
violation,
the
bargaining
order
would
have
been
an
appropriate
remedy
for
the
8
(a)
(1)
violation
and
is
so
indicated
by
the
franks
brothers
case
with
i
referred
to
in
320
u.s.
in
which
this
court
said
that
the
board
had
lost
its
--
that
the
union
had
lost
its
majority
because
of
the
employer's
coercive
threats.
and
nonetheless,
upheld
unanimously
the
bargaining
order
based
on
the
authorization
cards.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
in
321
u.s.
and
it
was
under
the
wagner
act
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
because
the
employer's
8
(a)
(1)
violation
in
this
case
could
not
readily
be
cured
so
as
to
restore
the
conditions
necessary
for
an
election
free
from
the
effects
of
his
wrongful
coercion.
the
board
was
warranted
in
relying
on
the
decisive
majority
indicated
by
the
cards
at
a
more
accurate
showing
of
employees'
sentiment
that
an
election
would
be
in
the
existing
circumstances,
and
thus
to
decide
that
the
requested
right
of
the
employees
to
bargain
collectively
should
be
enforced
without
further
delay.
now,
this
is
not
a
drastic
remedy
because
as
in
the
case
of
any
bargaining
order,
there
will
be
opportunities
for
interested
persons
to
request
another
election
to
measure
any
changes
in
employees
sentiment
after
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
in
sum,
therefore,
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
was
entirely
correct
in
treating
this
case
as
a
rather
routine
example
of
the
board's
proper
discharge
of
its
statutory
responsibilities,
which
is
the
flavor
one
gets
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
reviewing
this
record.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
sir.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
to
my
knowledge,
although
there
have
been
relatively
few
cases
in
which
the
only
wrongful
conduct,
the
only
unfair
labor
practice
was
in
implied
threats
or
coercion,
without
any
wrongful
interrogations
or
wrongful
discharges.
there
are
two
seventh
circuit
cases
upholding
the
board
in
such
situations
that
are
cited
in
our
brief,
and
those
are
the
only
ones
that
i
know
of
other
than
this
decision
from
the
first
circuit,
upholding
an
order
based
exclusively
on
this
kind
of
unfair
labor
practice.
thank
you.
