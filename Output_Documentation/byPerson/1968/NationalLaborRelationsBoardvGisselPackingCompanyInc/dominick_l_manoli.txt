mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
number
573
and
691
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
labor
act
requires
an
employer
to
bargain
with
their
union
or
with
their
representative
which
in
the
words
of
the
statute
has
been
designated
or
selected
by
a
majority
of
the
employees
in
an
appropriate
collective
bargaining
union.
for
more
than
30
years,
this
court
and
the
courts
of
appeals
both
under
the
original
act
as
well
as
the
present
act
have
enforced
board
orders
which
required
an
employer
to
bargain
with
the
union
which
the
employees
had
designated
as
their
bargain
representative
by
means
of
authorization
cards
and
the
employer
did
not
have
a
“good
faith”
doubt
of
the
union's
majority
status.
the
court
below,
the
court
below
which
in
the
past
had
accepted
authorization's
card
as
adequate
proof
of
a
union's
majority
status
for
purposes
of
a
bargaining
of
the
bargaining
obligation
under
section
8
(a)
(5)
of
the
statute
now
holds
that
these
authorization
cards
are
inherently
unreliable
and
that
an
employer,
when
he
is
confronted
with
the
demand
for
recognition
by
union,
whose
representative
status
is
base
solely
upon
these
authorization
cards.
that
the
employer
may
assert
a
good
faith
doubt
of
the
union's
majority
status,
refused
to
bargain,
insist
upon
an
election
and
all
of
these
irrespective
of
the
fact
that
concurrently
with
his
refusal
to
bargain
with
--
to
recognize
and
bargain
with
the
union
as
the
majority
representative
concurrently
with
that
action.
he
is
engaging
in
serious
unfair
labor
practice
which
may
either
belie
his
reliance
upon
his
good
faith
doubt
or
preclude
a
fair
election.
hence,
the
central
question
in
these
cases
and
not
only
these
two,
these
cases
that
were
shared
from
the
court
up
here
and
from
the
court
of
appeals
but
also
in
sinclair
case
which
from
the
first
circuit
which
will
follow
these
cases.
the
central
question
in
these
cases
is
whether
the
board
may
require
an
employer
to
bargain
with
the
union
whose
representative
status
is
based
solely
upon
authorization
cards
from
a
majority
of
the
employees
in
the
particular
unit.
and
the
employer's
concurrent
misconduct
at
the
time
that
he
refuses
to
bargain
with
the
union
on
the
base
of
those
cards
is
the
concurrent
misconduct
demonstrates,
demonstrates
that
is
asserted
doubt
--
that
he
is
refusing,
he
is
refusing
to
bargain
with
the
union
not
because
of
any
asserted
doubt
of
the
union's
majority
status
but
in
order
to
gain
time,
in
order
to
dissipate
the
union's
strength
and
avoid
bargaining
at
all.
now,
would
obviously
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
boards
--
i
think
you're
getting
at
what
the
board
calls
it
burnout
from
rule.
in
other
words,
if
a
union
comes
to
an
employer,
goes
to
an
employer,
and
demands
recognition
on
the
basis
of
cards,
and
the
employer
engages
an
unfair
labor
practice
at
that
particular
time.
the
board
will
nevertheless
permit
the
union
to
go
to
an
election.
if
the
union
loses
that
election
because
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
committed
by
the
employer
during
the
pre-election
period,
the
board
will
permit
the
union
then
to
go
ahead
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
and
on
the
basis
of
the
cards
demonstrate
that
it
had
a
majority
and
that
the
employer
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
that
problem
--
you
don't
have
to
decide
that
in
the
fourth
circuit
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
that
issue
is
present
however
in
the
sinclair
case,
the
one
from
the
first
circuit
because
all,
excuse
me
for
one
moment,
i'll
take
that
back.
in
one
of
the
cases
here
--
in
one
of
the
case
here,
there
was
an
election
which
the
union
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
and
that
question
is
here.
that's
right.
and
it
is
also
in
the
sinclair
case
as
i
recall
it.
now
obviously
the
time
that
i
have
at
my
disposal,
i
will
not
be
able
to
go
into
the
details
of
these
cases
here
but
i
think
i
can
fairly
say
--
i
can
fairly
say
that
the
factual
framework
in
which
this
question
arises
in
all
three
cases
is
not
essentially
dissimilar.
and
in
each
case,
you
had
the
union
which
engage
in
an
organizing
campaign
among
the
employees
and
in
the
course
of
that
organizing
campaign
it
obtain
cards
authorizing
it,
unqualifiedly.
there's
no
question
about
the
cards.
there's
no
ambiguity
about
these
cards
here
which
are
reproduced
in
our
brief,
which
unqualifiedly
designated
the
union
as
their
bargain
representatives
--
as
their
bargain
representatives
and
only
one
of
these
cases
from
the
fourth
circuit.
i
believe
that
social
to
the
sinclair
although
i
don't
want
to
get
into
that
one.
in
only
one
of
these
cases
was
any
question
raised
as
to
the
validity
of
the
cards
in
the
general
steel
case
that
claim
was
made
that
these
cards
were
obtained
by
mis
--
by
virtue
of
misrepresentations
as
to
their
purposes.
the
board
on
the
basis
of
the
entire
record
upon
the
basis
of
the
evidence
before
rejected
that
claim
and
found
that
all
these
cards
here,
all
of
these
cards
here
unqualifiedly
designated
the
union
as
the
bargain
representative
and
that
there
was
no
impropriety
in
the
procurement
of
these
cards.
now
armed
with
these
cards,
the
union
went
to
each
of
the
three
employers
in
these
particular
cases
here
and
asks
for
recognition.
the
employer
questioning
the
validity
of
the
cards,
question
the
union's
majority
status
and
refuse
to
bargain
to
the
union
insisted
upon
an
election.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
i
think
that
it
varied
from
case
to
case.and
some
of
them
the
employers
was
said
--
in
effect
said,
we
don't
--
we
don't
rely
on
cards.
we
think
that
they
are
unreliable
because
the
circumstances
and
i
wonder
which
they
may
be
may
have
been
procured.
in
another
case
an
employer
said,
i
don't
think
i
should
recognize
you
because
four
years
ago,
four
years
ago
--
there
was
an
election
in
which
this
particular
union
had
participated
and
got
lost.
and
still
another
case
that
employer
simply
said,
no
comment.
no
comment
and
still
another
case
the
employer
when
asked
to
recognizing
on
the
basis
of
the
cards
said
that
we
think
you
ought
to
go
to
an
election.
and
i
think
there's
one
case
here
where
the
employer
really
never
questions
the
cards,
never
question
cards
and
his
answer
was,
“no
comment”.
no
comment
and
there
seems
to
be
some
evidence
in
the
record
here
that
the
employer
actually
knew
that
a
majority
of
employers
had
selected
that
particular
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
if
the
union
goes
to
an
employer
and
says
to
the
employer,
we
have
cards
here
from
the
majority
of
your
employees
which
as
their
bargain
representative.
the
employer
may
say,
the
board
has
said
this
--
the
employer
may
say,
“i
don't
like
cards.
i
don't
wish
to
rely
upon
your
cards
and
i
do
insist
that
you
go
to
an
election.”
i
think
that
that's
the
proper
way
to
resolve
this
question
this
representation
question
is
to
go
to
an
election.
if
he
does
no
more
than
that,
he
may
even
engage.
i
mean
during
the
pre-election
period,
he
may
engage
in
the
speech
--
he
make
speeches
to
his
employees
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
will
--
the
general
counsel
will
not
issue
a
complaint
on
the
basis
of
that
in
that
kind
of
situation
where
the
employer
says
for
the
union,
i
don't
wish
to
rely
upon
cards
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
care
how
many
--
that's
right.
i
don't
care
how
many
cards
you
got
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
as
long
as
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
as
long
as
he
does
not
misbehave,
now
that's
why
they
say.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
does
not
misbehave,
does
not
engage
in
contemporaneously
with
the
refusal
to
accept
those
cards
that
he
does
not
engage
in
unfair
labor
practice
and
serious
unfair
labor
practice
because
the
board
in
some
case
where
the
employer
may
have
engaged
in
some
isolated
unfair
labor
practice.
it
still
will
permit
it
to
refuse
to
bargain
with
the
union.
it's
only
when
it
engages
in
serious
unfair
labor
practice
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
hope
it
didn't.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
your
honor.
i
think
the
board
is
change
a
little
bit
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
the
--
with
the
board
has
change
a
little
bit
in
his
approach
to
these
cards
here.
i
think
that
one
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
its
not
been
a
recent
change
really,
your
honor.
i
think
that
this
began
back
sometime
in
the
early
60's.
at
one
time,
the
board
would
take
the
position
and
simply
i
might
say
that
we
sold
virtually
all
the
courts,
all
the
courts
with
this
proposition
that
an
employer
when
a
union
came
to
him
and
said,
i
--
we
want
to
be
recognized
based
on
these
cards,
it
was
not
enough
for
him
to
say,
i
don't
like
cards.
he
had
to
have
or
not
enough
for
him
to
say
that
i
have
a
good
faith
doubt
of
your
majority
status.
he
also
had
to
have
some
objective
evidence
which
supported
his
good
faith
doubt.
today,
the
board
does
not
insist
that
when
an
employer
is
confronted
with
a
demand
for
recognition
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
well,
i
think
you
have
to
take
the
aaron
brothers
case,
your
honor.
the
aaron
brothers
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
that
one
here
has
made
it
very
clear.
and
also,
you
might
take
a
look
at
page
22
of
our
brief
where
we
indicate
its
not
in
every
case
even
if
--
even
where
the
employer
may
commit
some
unfair
labor
for
practices,
excuse
me
i'm
getting
away
from
this
thing.
even
where
the
employer
may
commit
some
unfair
labor
practice
when
he
refuses
to
accept
these
cards
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
words
contemporaneous,
contemporaneous
with
refusal
upon
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
what
we
think
is
the
narrow
issue
as
we
see
that's
presented
in
this
particular
case
because
i
didn't
get
through
with
my
facts.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
i
think
i
can
skip
those
from
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
he
does
not
have
bargain.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
can
wait
for
the
election.
and
again,
i
want
to
emphasize
your
honor
that
of
course
this
is
the
case
in
which
has
been
no
misbehavior
that
kind
that
i'm
speaking
about
in
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
no,
there's
no
obligation
of
bargain.
if
the
union
confronts
with
the
cards,
under
the
board's
view
of
the
law,
the
employer
can
say,
i
want
to
go
to
an
election
until
that
election
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
one
election
that
he
doesn't
wish
to
rely
upon
cards.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
he
does.
he
does
and
there
is
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
has
the
same
right
or
his
speech.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
the
board's
position.
now,
of
course
what
this
free
speech
--
what
isn't
free
speech
--
you
will
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
you
will
hear
more
of
that
as
in
the
sinclair
case.
but
he
is
the
board
will
permit
him
to
speak
his
speech
to
the
employers
who
are
trying
to
dissuade
them
not
to
vote
for
the
union,
not
to
support
for
the
union
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
or
not
to
sign
out
authorization
card,
that's
right.
he
can
do
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct.
with
one
–
may
i
just
add
a
very
small
fact
on
to
that
kind
of
case?
it
really
doesn't
--
but
in
order
to
be
completely
accurately.
the
board
had
a
case
in
which
the
employer
when
the
union
demand
recognition
on
the
basis
of
the
cards.
he
did
not
question
the
cards.
he
did
not
raise
any
question
about
this
majority
but
he
refused
to
bargain
with
the
union
because
he
says
he
thought.
he
thought
that
he
was
not
subject
to
the
labor
act.
he
was
not
subject
to
labor
act.
subsequently,
as
an
afterthought
you
might
say,
he
said
well,
i
don't
want
to
recognize
you
because
i
don't
rely
on
cards.
that's
really
an
off
beat
kind
of
a
case.
in
that
particular
case,
the
board
would
not
permit
the
employer
to
come
up
--
after
having
refuse
to
bargain
with
the
union
on
the
basis
of
this
that
he
did
not
come
under
the
act
would
not
permit
him
to
resurrect
or
inject
into
the
picture,
his
good
faith
doubt
of
the
union's
majority
status.
but
as
i
say
that's
a
kind
of
an
off
beat
type
of
case
but
your
statement
what
i
--
board's
position
today
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
right.
either
he
or
the
union
under
the
statute
may
ask
for
an
election.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no.
there
are
unfair
labor
practices
that
may
take
during
the
course
of
the
union
organizing
campaign.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
and
what's
equalizing
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
same
rule
applies.
if
he
commits
so
serious
unfair
labor
practice
then
that
the
union
has
a
majority
of
the
cards
which
are
otherwise
valid.
he
will
be
subject
to
a
bargain
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
i
don't
think
so
your
honor,
but
the
board
has
never
had
the
case
in
which
the
employer
just
said
when
the
union
asked
him
to
a
--
to
bargain
and
to
recognize
it
and
say,
“go
away”,
and
said
no
more
than
that
or
said,
“to
go
away
and
i
want
an
election.”
usually
of
course,
with
your
case
where
the
employer
will
say,
“i
don't
trust
cards.
i
don't
think
they
are
reliable.
i
think
we
have
to
go
an
election.”
but
although
the
board
is
not
dealt
with
the
first
case,
i
don't
think
that
any
meaningful
distinction
can
be
drawn
between
two
cases.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
think
you
will
find
without
spelling
out
which
particular
case
in
which
the
employer
was
suppose
to
or
so
as
he
did
say.
we
don't
want
to
rely
upon
cards.
we
want
to
go
to
an
election.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
and
in
another
i
think
there
were
two
of
those
cases.
there
were
--
another
--
one
of
these
cases
here
where
the
union
actually
put
that
authorization
cards
in
front
of
the
employer.
the
employer
took
a
glance
out
and
then
he
says.
he
said,
“i
don't
want
to
go
on
the
basis
of
cards.
we
want
to
go
on
election.”
so
as
i
say,
i
wouldn't
draw
any
narrow
distinction
between
where
the
employer
may
not
be
articulate
enough
to
say,
“well,
look
i've
heard
all
the
story,
all
the
stories
about
cards
not
being
very
reliable.”
but
if
he
simply
says,
“i
want
to
go
to
an
election.
i
don't
--
i
just
--
that's
i
think
the
way
union
should
establish
his
majority
status
is
by
election.”
then
i
think
that
the
board
will
permit
it.
the
board
will
permit
him
to
refuse
to
bargain
without
union
to
recognize
it
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
i
think
so.
i
think
so.
the
--
well,
i
will
not
--
i
think
we've
pretty
much
got
in
the
facts
of
these
of
cases
out,
so
i
won't
spend
any
more
time
with
that.
i've
already
indicated
what
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
is
as
the
unreliability
of
these
cards.
now,
i
want
to
go
into
the
two
arguments
that
i
think
ought
to
be
brought
out
in
connection
with
these
cads.
the
--
our
analysis
of
course
begins
with
section
85
of
the
act.
section
85
of
the
act
makes
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
refuse
to
bargain
with
the
representative
of
his
employees
as
defined
in
sections
9
(a)
of
the
act.
section
9
(a)
of
the
act
in
turn
defines
a
representative
as
one
which
has
been
designated
or
selected
by
a
majority
of
the
employees
in
an
appropriate
bargaining
unit.
section
9
(a)
does
not
specify,
it
does
not
specify
how
the
employees
will
designate
or
select
their
employees
and
both
under
the
original
wagner
act
as
well
as
the
present
act.
the
courts
of
appeals
had
consistently
recognize,
had
consistently
recognize
that
a
union
could
establish
its
majority
status
not
only
by
means
of
an
election
but
also
by
other
means
including,
including
authorization
cards.
and
this
court
in
the
arkansas
flooring
case
which
was
decided
in
19
--
of
some
nine
years,
some
nine
years
after
they
taft-hartley
amendments
of
1947
and
i'll
come
to
those
amendments
in
just
a
moment.
the
court
in
that
particular
case
said
that
a
union
may
establish
its
selection
that
an
election
was
not
the
only
means
for
a
union
to
establish
its
representative
status
but
that
it
could
do
so
by
other
means
including
authorization
cards.
now,
the
legislative
history
of
--
the
1947
amendments
on
which
the
court
below
heavily
rely
for
its
contrary
view
--
for
its
contrary
review,
we
submit,
we
suggest
that
it
does
not
bar.
it
does
not
bar
reliance
upon
authorization
cards
as
proof
of
the
union's
majority
status.
i
might
say
that
the
court
below
is
the
only
one
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
frankly,
all
the
courts
of
appeals
have
had
this
problem
that
the
law
--
that
the
court
below
is
the
only
one
that
interprets
the
94
--
1947
amendments
to
bar,
to
bar
the
use
cards
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
a
union's
majority
status
as
a
predicate
for
bargaining
order
under
section
85
and
it's
the
only
court
that
has
set
that
only
that
the
union
must
establish
his
majority
status
--
can
only
establish
his
majority
status
as
a
predicate
for
bargaining
or
only
via
the
election
root.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that's
quite
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
under
the
wagner
act,
the
wagner
act
made
no
provision
as
your
honors
indicated
for
an
employer
to
file
a
representation
petition.
it
was
the
board's
practice
in
those
days
to
entertain
a
petition
from
an
employer
if
two
or
more
unions
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
if
two
or
more
unions
were
make
--
demanded
recognition.
in
that
case,
the
board
would
entertain
--
would
entertain
the
election,
the
petition
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
explicit.
it
made
no
provision.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
was
completely
sudden,
it
made
no
provision
the
47
amendments
did
take
care
of
that
particular
problem
because
under
the
47
amendments
an
employer
is
now
permitted
to
file
his
representation
petition
whether
its
one
or
more
unions
--
one
or
more
unions
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
under
the
wagner
act,
there
was
a
provision
in
section
9
there
which
empowered
the
board
to
ascertain
whenever
a
question
concerning
representation
arose
to
determine
that
question
either
by
means
of
an
election
or
partly
in
the
exact
language
of
the
wagner
act
or
by
other
suitable
means,
other
suitable
means
for
ascertaining
the
employee's
wishes.
again,
the
47
amendment
knocked
that
part
of
the
act.
by
other
suitable
means
and
the
47
amendments
made
up
board
election
the
sole
basis
for
a
formal
board
certification.
of
course,
a
board
bargaining
order
is
to
be
distinguished
from
the
board
certification
which
is
use
following
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
there
were.
there
were
elections.
i
thought
your
honor
was
going
to
asked
me,
did
the
board
certify
unions
since
all
the
suitable
methods
were
also
available
to
it?
did
it
often
certify
union
on
the
basis
of
something
other
than
election?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
did
that
until
1939.
it
would
certify
union
on
the
basis
of
cards
or
some
other.
well,
presume
about,
usually
cards
or
maybe
some
other
written
proof
of
this
majority
status.
in
1939,
the
board
abandoned
that
practice
but
the
board
however
continued
to
certify
a
union
on
the
basis
of
cards
while
the
employer
and
the
union,
both
agreed
to
have
a
crossed
check
of
the
cards
as
against
the
payroll
in
order
to
determine
the
authenticity
of
the
cards.
and
in
that
particular
case
--
in
that
particular
situation,
the
board
continued
after
1939
not
many
of
those
cases,
i
suspect,
i
really
don't
know
how
many,
but
probably
not
many
but
nonetheless
the
board
would
continue
to
issue
certifications
on
the
basis
of
that
kind
of
a
crossed
check
with
both
parties
agreed
that
if
the
crossed
check
was
correct,
the
certification
would
issue.
again,
if
i
may
come
back
quickly
to
the
1947
amendments,
the
47
amendments
do
no
longer
permit
the
board
certification
to
issue
on
anything
but
in
an
election.
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
will
permit
him
to
go
on
election
as
long
as
he
does
not
misbehave.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
your
honor
--
if
your
honors
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
i
think
it's
the
rule
we've
indicated
--
it's
the
board
rule
in
our
process
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
i
think
that
under
the
board
--
let
me
put
two
different
kind
of
cases
in
order
to
answer
your
honor's
question.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
is
he
saying,
if
i
may
put
to
your
question
in
return.
is
he
saying
that
i
have
no
doubt
--
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
have
cards
here
signed
by
a
majority
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
or
i
have
no
good
faith
doubt
that
these
cards
have
been
signed
by
majority
of
my
employees
but
i
still
don't
like
cards
and
i
want
to
go
an
election.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
the
board
will
permit
him
to
go
on
election.
now,
let
me
put
this
case
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
put
this
case,
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
that's
right.
now,
let
me
put
this
case.
now,
suppose
that
the
employer
when
faced
with
these
cards
he
said
--
he
would
say,
“i've
made
my
own
independent
check
of
the
employees
and
i
discovered
from
my
own
independent
check
of
the
employees
and
independently
of
your
cards
that
they
do
want
to
use
their
bargain
representative.”
now,
that
case
there,
he
will
be
required
to
bargain
with
the
union
even
though
he'd
be
not
engaged
in
any
unfair
labor
practice.
i
want
to
make
that
clear.
even
the
fourth
circuit
in
that
kind
of
a
case
would
enforce
a
bargaining
order
where
the
employer
has
made
its
own
independent
poll
of
the
employees
and
on
the
basis
of
that
he's
been
--
he
--
the
employees
have
told
him,
“yes,
we
want
this
union
a
majority
of
them.
then
even
fourth
circuit.”
the
fourth
circuit
will
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
he
says,
“yes,
i
think
you
would
draw
a
line
between
those
two
and
i
don't
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
you
put
that
way,
it
cannot
insist
upon
an
election
when
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
can
not.
he
can
not
insist
upon
election
because
there
--
there
he's
not
merely
saying
in
the
case
of
mr.
justice
marshall
has
put
to
us.
he's
not
merely
saying,
i
know
you
got
cards
here,
but
he's
also
saying
that
he
knows.
he
knows
independently
of
the
cards,
independent
of
the
cards
of
the
majority
of
the
employees
have
designated
that
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that's
right.
now,
to
go
on
with
the
legislative
history
that
as
i've
indicated
that
the
courts
had
uniformly
--
had
uniformly
interpreted
both
the
wagner
act
and
taft-hartley
act
to
permit
the
use
of
cards
for
union
to
demonstrate
its
majority
as
majority
status.
the
47
amendments
did
not
change
either
section
8
(a)
(5)
or
which
was
8
(5)
in
the
original
wagner
act
or
section
9
(a).
but
in
fact,
the
legislative
history
the
1947
amendments
shows
that
the
conference
committee
specifically
rejected
a
house
passed
amendments
which
have
--
where
have
relieve
the
employer,
which
we
have
a
relieve
the
employer
of
any
obligation
to
bargain
with
the
union,
which
based
its
majority
status
upon
cards.
congress
specifically
rejected
that
proposal
which
would
have
amended
section
8
(a)
(5)
so
as
to
permit
the
board
to
issue
a
bargaining
order
only
when
the
employer
was
either
refusing
to
bargain
with
the
union
that
he
was
currently
recognizing
or
a
union
which
have
been
certified
by
the
board
after
an
election.
congress
says
that
it
rejected
that
amendment,
rejected
that
amendment
and
retained
the
language
of
section
8
(a)
(5),
sections
9
(a)
which
from
the
very
beginning
of
this
statute
had
been
interpreted
both
by
the
board,
by
the
courts
as
permitting
the
use
of
cards
to
establish
a
union
as
majority
status.
the
1959
amendments
when
there
was
discussion
in
--
when
there
is
the
legislative
consideration
of
the
1959
amendments,
congress
again
took
note
of
the
fact
that
a
board
--
that
a
bargaining
obligation
under
section
8
(5),
that
the
issuance
of
a
board
bargaining
order
was
not
dependent
upon
a
board
election.
it
took
specific
note
of
board
cases
where
the
board
had
required
an
employer
to
bargain
with
the
union
which
was
representative
status
was
based
upon
cards
and
where
the
employer
had
engaged
in
misconduct
which
belies
his
good
faith
doubt.
nonetheless,
the
1959
congress
did
not
amend
the
basic
language
of
section
8
(5)
or
section
9
which
as
i
repeatedly
offset
is
the
basis
for
the
use
of
cards
as
a
means
for
establishing
union's
majority
position.
now,
its
argued
--
as
argued
very
strongly
that
cards
because
of
the
circumstances
--
because
of
the
circumstances
that
may
attend
their
procurement
are
inherently
unreliable
and
that
an
election
is
the
only
proper
way
of
safeguarding
the
employees
and
permitting
them
to
vote
their
convictions.
alright,
i
would
think
that
the
fact
that
the
congress
--
that
congress
must
have
discounted
this
argument
when
in
1947,
it
rejected
the
house
passed
amendment
which
was
where
relieved
the
employer
of
any
obligation
to
bargain
with
the
union
whose
representative
status
was
based
upon
cards.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
boards
was
been
using
cards
all
along
every
since
the
beginning
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
has
been
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
shift
has
been
i
think
primarily
in
this
respect
that
the
board
originally
would
say
the
employer
had
to
come
forward
with
some
objective
evidence
to
support
his
good
faith
doubt.
today
the
board
has
not
insists
that
he
come
forward
with
the
objective
evidence.
in
fact,
the
board
puts
it
burden
of
proving
the
employer's
lack
of
a
good
faith
doubt
--
puts
that
burden
upon
the
general
counsel.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
unless
--
unless
he
had
a
good
faith
doubt
based
upon
objective
considerations.
i
would
like
phrase
it
that
way.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
all
right,
sir.
the
--
i'm
afraid
my
time
is
up.
i
have
to
leave
the
rest
of
it
to
the
brief.
this
is
a
case
that
might
have
needed
a
little
bit
more
time.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
number
573
and
691
are
here
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
labor
act
requires
an
employer
to
bargain
with
their
union
or
with
their
representative
which
in
the
words
of
the
statute
has
been
designated
or
selected
by
a
majority
of
the
employees
in
an
appropriate
collective
bargaining
union.
for
more
than
30
years,
this
court
and
the
courts
of
appeals
both
under
the
original
act
as
well
as
the
present
act
have
enforced
board
orders
which
required
an
employer
to
bargain
with
the
union
which
the
employees
had
designated
as
their
bargain
representative
by
means
of
authorization
cards
and
the
employer
did
not
have
a
“good
faith”
doubt
of
the
union's
majority
status.
the
court
below,
the
court
below
which
in
the
past
had
accepted
authorization's
card
as
adequate
proof
of
a
union's
majority
status
for
purposes
of
a
bargaining
of
the
bargaining
obligation
under
section
8
(a)
(5)
of
the
statute
now
holds
that
these
authorization
cards
are
inherently
unreliable
and
that
an
employer,
when
he
is
confronted
with
the
demand
for
recognition
by
union,
whose
representative
status
is
base
solely
upon
these
authorization
cards.
that
the
employer
may
assert
a
good
faith
doubt
of
the
union's
majority
status,
refused
to
bargain,
insist
upon
an
election
and
all
of
these
irrespective
of
the
fact
that
concurrently
with
his
refusal
to
bargain
with
--
to
recognize
and
bargain
with
the
union
as
the
majority
representative
concurrently
with
that
action.
he
is
engaging
in
serious
unfair
labor
practice
which
may
either
belie
his
reliance
upon
his
good
faith
doubt
or
preclude
a
fair
election.
hence,
the
central
question
in
these
cases
and
not
only
these
two,
these
cases
that
were
shared
from
the
court
up
here
and
from
the
court
of
appeals
but
also
in
sinclair
case
which
from
the
first
circuit
which
will
follow
these
cases.
the
central
question
in
these
cases
is
whether
the
board
may
require
an
employer
to
bargain
with
the
union
whose
representative
status
is
based
solely
upon
authorization
cards
from
a
majority
of
the
employees
in
the
particular
unit.
and
the
employer's
concurrent
misconduct
at
the
time
that
he
refuses
to
bargain
with
the
union
on
the
base
of
those
cards
is
the
concurrent
misconduct
demonstrates,
demonstrates
that
is
asserted
doubt
--
that
he
is
refusing,
he
is
refusing
to
bargain
with
the
union
not
because
of
any
asserted
doubt
of
the
union's
majority
status
but
in
order
to
gain
time,
in
order
to
dissipate
the
union's
strength
and
avoid
bargaining
at
all.
now,
would
obviously
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
boards
--
i
think
you're
getting
at
what
the
board
calls
it
burnout
from
rule.
in
other
words,
if
a
union
comes
to
an
employer,
goes
to
an
employer,
and
demands
recognition
on
the
basis
of
cards,
and
the
employer
engages
an
unfair
labor
practice
at
that
particular
time.
the
board
will
nevertheless
permit
the
union
to
go
to
an
election.
if
the
union
loses
that
election
because
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
committed
by
the
employer
during
the
pre-election
period,
the
board
will
permit
the
union
then
to
go
ahead
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
and
on
the
basis
of
the
cards
demonstrate
that
it
had
a
majority
and
that
the
employer
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
that
problem
--
you
don't
have
to
decide
that
in
the
fourth
circuit
case.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
that
issue
is
present
however
in
the
sinclair
case,
the
one
from
the
first
circuit
because
all,
excuse
me
for
one
moment,
i'll
take
that
back.
in
one
of
the
cases
here
--
in
one
of
the
case
here,
there
was
an
election
which
the
union
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
and
that
question
is
here.
that's
right.
and
it
is
also
in
the
sinclair
case
as
i
recall
it.
now
obviously
the
time
that
i
have
at
my
disposal,
i
will
not
be
able
to
go
into
the
details
of
these
cases
here
but
i
think
i
can
fairly
say
--
i
can
fairly
say
that
the
factual
framework
in
which
this
question
arises
in
all
three
cases
is
not
essentially
dissimilar.
and
in
each
case,
you
had
the
union
which
engage
in
an
organizing
campaign
among
the
employees
and
in
the
course
of
that
organizing
campaign
it
obtain
cards
authorizing
it,
unqualifiedly.
there's
no
question
about
the
cards.
there's
no
ambiguity
about
these
cards
here
which
are
reproduced
in
our
brief,
which
unqualifiedly
designated
the
union
as
their
bargain
representatives
--
as
their
bargain
representatives
and
only
one
of
these
cases
from
the
fourth
circuit.
i
believe
that
social
to
the
sinclair
although
i
don't
want
to
get
into
that
one.
in
only
one
of
these
cases
was
any
question
raised
as
to
the
validity
of
the
cards
in
the
general
steel
case
that
claim
was
made
that
these
cards
were
obtained
by
mis
--
by
virtue
of
misrepresentations
as
to
their
purposes.
the
board
on
the
basis
of
the
entire
record
upon
the
basis
of
the
evidence
before
rejected
that
claim
and
found
that
all
these
cards
here,
all
of
these
cards
here
unqualifiedly
designated
the
union
as
the
bargain
representative
and
that
there
was
no
impropriety
in
the
procurement
of
these
cards.
now
armed
with
these
cards,
the
union
went
to
each
of
the
three
employers
in
these
particular
cases
here
and
asks
for
recognition.
the
employer
questioning
the
validity
of
the
cards,
question
the
union's
majority
status
and
refuse
to
bargain
to
the
union
insisted
upon
an
election.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
oh,
i
think
that
it
varied
from
case
to
case.and
some
of
them
the
employers
was
said
--
in
effect
said,
we
don't
--
we
don't
rely
on
cards.
we
think
that
they
are
unreliable
because
the
circumstances
and
i
wonder
which
they
may
be
may
have
been
procured.
in
another
case
an
employer
said,
i
don't
think
i
should
recognize
you
because
four
years
ago,
four
years
ago
--
there
was
an
election
in
which
this
particular
union
had
participated
and
got
lost.
and
still
another
case
that
employer
simply
said,
no
comment.
no
comment
and
still
another
case
the
employer
when
asked
to
recognizing
on
the
basis
of
the
cards
said
that
we
think
you
ought
to
go
to
an
election.
and
i
think
there's
one
case
here
where
the
employer
really
never
questions
the
cards,
never
question
cards
and
his
answer
was,
“no
comment”.
no
comment
and
there
seems
to
be
some
evidence
in
the
record
here
that
the
employer
actually
knew
that
a
majority
of
employers
had
selected
that
particular
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
your
honor,
if
the
union
goes
to
an
employer
and
says
to
the
employer,
we
have
cards
here
from
the
majority
of
your
employees
which
as
their
bargain
representative.
the
employer
may
say,
the
board
has
said
this
--
the
employer
may
say,
“i
don't
like
cards.
i
don't
wish
to
rely
upon
your
cards
and
i
do
insist
that
you
go
to
an
election.”
i
think
that
that's
the
proper
way
to
resolve
this
question
this
representation
question
is
to
go
to
an
election.
if
he
does
no
more
than
that,
he
may
even
engage.
i
mean
during
the
pre-election
period,
he
may
engage
in
the
speech
--
he
make
speeches
to
his
employees
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
will
--
the
general
counsel
will
not
issue
a
complaint
on
the
basis
of
that
in
that
kind
of
situation
where
the
employer
says
for
the
union,
i
don't
wish
to
rely
upon
cards
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
don't
care
how
many
--
that's
right.
i
don't
care
how
many
cards
you
got
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
as
long
as
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
as
long
as
he
does
not
misbehave,
now
that's
why
they
say.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
does
not
misbehave,
does
not
engage
in
contemporaneously
with
the
refusal
to
accept
those
cards
that
he
does
not
engage
in
unfair
labor
practice
and
serious
unfair
labor
practice
because
the
board
in
some
case
where
the
employer
may
have
engaged
in
some
isolated
unfair
labor
practice.
it
still
will
permit
it
to
refuse
to
bargain
with
the
union.
it's
only
when
it
engages
in
serious
unfair
labor
practice
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
hope
it
didn't.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
your
honor.
i
think
the
board
is
change
a
little
bit
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
the
--
with
the
board
has
change
a
little
bit
in
his
approach
to
these
cards
here.
i
think
that
one
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
its
not
been
a
recent
change
really,
your
honor.
i
think
that
this
began
back
sometime
in
the
early
60's.
at
one
time,
the
board
would
take
the
position
and
simply
i
might
say
that
we
sold
virtually
all
the
courts,
all
the
courts
with
this
proposition
that
an
employer
when
a
union
came
to
him
and
said,
i
--
we
want
to
be
recognized
based
on
these
cards,
it
was
not
enough
for
him
to
say,
i
don't
like
cards.
he
had
to
have
or
not
enough
for
him
to
say
that
i
have
a
good
faith
doubt
of
your
majority
status.
he
also
had
to
have
some
objective
evidence
which
supported
his
good
faith
doubt.
today,
the
board
does
not
insist
that
when
an
employer
is
confronted
with
a
demand
for
recognition
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
well,
i
think
you
have
to
take
the
aaron
brothers
case,
your
honor.
the
aaron
brothers
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
that
one
here
has
made
it
very
clear.
and
also,
you
might
take
a
look
at
page
22
of
our
brief
where
we
indicate
its
not
in
every
case
even
if
--
even
where
the
employer
may
commit
some
unfair
labor
for
practices,
excuse
me
i'm
getting
away
from
this
thing.
even
where
the
employer
may
commit
some
unfair
labor
practice
when
he
refuses
to
accept
these
cards
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
words
contemporaneous,
contemporaneous
with
refusal
upon
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
what
we
think
is
the
narrow
issue
as
we
see
that's
presented
in
this
particular
case
because
i
didn't
get
through
with
my
facts.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
i
think
i
can
skip
those
from
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
sir.
he
does
not
have
bargain.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
can
wait
for
the
election.
and
again,
i
want
to
emphasize
your
honor
that
of
course
this
is
the
case
in
which
has
been
no
misbehavior
that
kind
that
i'm
speaking
about
in
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
no,
there's
no
obligation
of
bargain.
if
the
union
confronts
with
the
cards,
under
the
board's
view
of
the
law,
the
employer
can
say,
i
want
to
go
to
an
election
until
that
election
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
one
election
that
he
doesn't
wish
to
rely
upon
cards.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
he
does.
he
does
and
there
is
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
has
the
same
right
or
his
speech.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
the
board's
position.
now,
of
course
what
this
free
speech
--
what
isn't
free
speech
--
you
will
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
you
will
hear
more
of
that
as
in
the
sinclair
case.
but
he
is
the
board
will
permit
him
to
speak
his
speech
to
the
employers
who
are
trying
to
dissuade
them
not
to
vote
for
the
union,
not
to
support
for
the
union
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
or
not
to
sign
out
authorization
card,
that's
right.
he
can
do
that.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct.
with
one
–
may
i
just
add
a
very
small
fact
on
to
that
kind
of
case?
it
really
doesn't
--
but
in
order
to
be
completely
accurately.
the
board
had
a
case
in
which
the
employer
when
the
union
demand
recognition
on
the
basis
of
the
cards.
he
did
not
question
the
cards.
he
did
not
raise
any
question
about
this
majority
but
he
refused
to
bargain
with
the
union
because
he
says
he
thought.
he
thought
that
he
was
not
subject
to
the
labor
act.
he
was
not
subject
to
labor
act.
subsequently,
as
an
afterthought
you
might
say,
he
said
well,
i
don't
want
to
recognize
you
because
i
don't
rely
on
cards.
that's
really
an
off
beat
kind
of
a
case.
in
that
particular
case,
the
board
would
not
permit
the
employer
to
come
up
--
after
having
refuse
to
bargain
with
the
union
on
the
basis
of
this
that
he
did
not
come
under
the
act
would
not
permit
him
to
resurrect
or
inject
into
the
picture,
his
good
faith
doubt
of
the
union's
majority
status.
but
as
i
say
that's
a
kind
of
an
off
beat
type
of
case
but
your
statement
what
i
--
board's
position
today
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
right.
either
he
or
the
union
under
the
statute
may
ask
for
an
election.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no.
there
are
unfair
labor
practices
that
may
take
during
the
course
of
the
union
organizing
campaign.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
and
what's
equalizing
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
same
rule
applies.
if
he
commits
so
serious
unfair
labor
practice
then
that
the
union
has
a
majority
of
the
cards
which
are
otherwise
valid.
he
will
be
subject
to
a
bargain
your
honor.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
i
don't
think
so
your
honor,
but
the
board
has
never
had
the
case
in
which
the
employer
just
said
when
the
union
asked
him
to
a
--
to
bargain
and
to
recognize
it
and
say,
“go
away”,
and
said
no
more
than
that
or
said,
“to
go
away
and
i
want
an
election.”
usually
of
course,
with
your
case
where
the
employer
will
say,
“i
don't
trust
cards.
i
don't
think
they
are
reliable.
i
think
we
have
to
go
an
election.”
but
although
the
board
is
not
dealt
with
the
first
case,
i
don't
think
that
any
meaningful
distinction
can
be
drawn
between
two
cases.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
well,
i
think
you
will
find
without
spelling
out
which
particular
case
in
which
the
employer
was
suppose
to
or
so
as
he
did
say.
we
don't
want
to
rely
upon
cards.
we
want
to
go
to
an
election.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
and
in
another
i
think
there
were
two
of
those
cases.
there
were
--
another
--
one
of
these
cases
here
where
the
union
actually
put
that
authorization
cards
in
front
of
the
employer.
the
employer
took
a
glance
out
and
then
he
says.
he
said,
“i
don't
want
to
go
on
the
basis
of
cards.
we
want
to
go
on
election.”
so
as
i
say,
i
wouldn't
draw
any
narrow
distinction
between
where
the
employer
may
not
be
articulate
enough
to
say,
“well,
look
i've
heard
all
the
story,
all
the
stories
about
cards
not
being
very
reliable.”
but
if
he
simply
says,
“i
want
to
go
to
an
election.
i
don't
--
i
just
--
that's
i
think
the
way
union
should
establish
his
majority
status
is
by
election.”
then
i
think
that
the
board
will
permit
it.
the
board
will
permit
him
to
refuse
to
bargain
without
union
to
recognize
it
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
i
think
so.
i
think
so.
the
--
well,
i
will
not
--
i
think
we've
pretty
much
got
in
the
facts
of
these
of
cases
out,
so
i
won't
spend
any
more
time
with
that.
i've
already
indicated
what
the
fourth
circuit's
opinion
is
as
the
unreliability
of
these
cards.
now,
i
want
to
go
into
the
two
arguments
that
i
think
ought
to
be
brought
out
in
connection
with
these
cads.
the
--
our
analysis
of
course
begins
with
section
85
of
the
act.
section
85
of
the
act
makes
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
refuse
to
bargain
with
the
representative
of
his
employees
as
defined
in
sections
9
(a)
of
the
act.
section
9
(a)
of
the
act
in
turn
defines
a
representative
as
one
which
has
been
designated
or
selected
by
a
majority
of
the
employees
in
an
appropriate
bargaining
unit.
section
9
(a)
does
not
specify,
it
does
not
specify
how
the
employees
will
designate
or
select
their
employees
and
both
under
the
original
wagner
act
as
well
as
the
present
act.
the
courts
of
appeals
had
consistently
recognize,
had
consistently
recognize
that
a
union
could
establish
its
majority
status
not
only
by
means
of
an
election
but
also
by
other
means
including,
including
authorization
cards.
and
this
court
in
the
arkansas
flooring
case
which
was
decided
in
19
--
of
some
nine
years,
some
nine
years
after
they
taft-hartley
amendments
of
1947
and
i'll
come
to
those
amendments
in
just
a
moment.
the
court
in
that
particular
case
said
that
a
union
may
establish
its
selection
that
an
election
was
not
the
only
means
for
a
union
to
establish
its
representative
status
but
that
it
could
do
so
by
other
means
including
authorization
cards.
now,
the
legislative
history
of
--
the
1947
amendments
on
which
the
court
below
heavily
rely
for
its
contrary
view
--
for
its
contrary
review,
we
submit,
we
suggest
that
it
does
not
bar.
it
does
not
bar
reliance
upon
authorization
cards
as
proof
of
the
union's
majority
status.
i
might
say
that
the
court
below
is
the
only
one
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
frankly,
all
the
courts
of
appeals
have
had
this
problem
that
the
law
--
that
the
court
below
is
the
only
one
that
interprets
the
94
--
1947
amendments
to
bar,
to
bar
the
use
cards
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
a
union's
majority
status
as
a
predicate
for
bargaining
order
under
section
85
and
it's
the
only
court
that
has
set
that
only
that
the
union
must
establish
his
majority
status
--
can
only
establish
his
majority
status
as
a
predicate
for
bargaining
or
only
via
the
election
root.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that's
quite
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
under
the
wagner
act,
the
wagner
act
made
no
provision
as
your
honors
indicated
for
an
employer
to
file
a
representation
petition.
it
was
the
board's
practice
in
those
days
to
entertain
a
petition
from
an
employer
if
two
or
more
unions
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
if
two
or
more
unions
were
make
--
demanded
recognition.
in
that
case,
the
board
would
entertain
--
would
entertain
the
election,
the
petition
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no
explicit.
it
made
no
provision.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
it
was
completely
sudden,
it
made
no
provision
the
47
amendments
did
take
care
of
that
particular
problem
because
under
the
47
amendments
an
employer
is
now
permitted
to
file
his
representation
petition
whether
its
one
or
more
unions
--
one
or
more
unions
that
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
under
the
wagner
act,
there
was
a
provision
in
section
9
there
which
empowered
the
board
to
ascertain
whenever
a
question
concerning
representation
arose
to
determine
that
question
either
by
means
of
an
election
or
partly
in
the
exact
language
of
the
wagner
act
or
by
other
suitable
means,
other
suitable
means
for
ascertaining
the
employee's
wishes.
again,
the
47
amendment
knocked
that
part
of
the
act.
by
other
suitable
means
and
the
47
amendments
made
up
board
election
the
sole
basis
for
a
formal
board
certification.
of
course,
a
board
bargaining
order
is
to
be
distinguished
from
the
board
certification
which
is
use
following
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
there
were.
there
were
elections.
i
thought
your
honor
was
going
to
asked
me,
did
the
board
certify
unions
since
all
the
suitable
methods
were
also
available
to
it?
did
it
often
certify
union
on
the
basis
of
something
other
than
election?
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
did
that
until
1939.
it
would
certify
union
on
the
basis
of
cards
or
some
other.
well,
presume
about,
usually
cards
or
maybe
some
other
written
proof
of
this
majority
status.
in
1939,
the
board
abandoned
that
practice
but
the
board
however
continued
to
certify
a
union
on
the
basis
of
cards
while
the
employer
and
the
union,
both
agreed
to
have
a
crossed
check
of
the
cards
as
against
the
payroll
in
order
to
determine
the
authenticity
of
the
cards.
and
in
that
particular
case
--
in
that
particular
situation,
the
board
continued
after
1939
not
many
of
those
cases,
i
suspect,
i
really
don't
know
how
many,
but
probably
not
many
but
nonetheless
the
board
would
continue
to
issue
certifications
on
the
basis
of
that
kind
of
a
crossed
check
with
both
parties
agreed
that
if
the
crossed
check
was
correct,
the
certification
would
issue.
again,
if
i
may
come
back
quickly
to
the
1947
amendments,
the
47
amendments
do
no
longer
permit
the
board
certification
to
issue
on
anything
but
in
an
election.
the
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
will
permit
him
to
go
on
election
as
long
as
he
does
not
misbehave.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
sir
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
your
honor
--
if
your
honors
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
no,
i
think
it's
the
rule
we've
indicated
--
it's
the
board
rule
in
our
process
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
--
i
think
that
under
the
board
--
let
me
put
two
different
kind
of
cases
in
order
to
answer
your
honor's
question.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
but
is
he
saying,
if
i
may
put
to
your
question
in
return.
is
he
saying
that
i
have
no
doubt
--
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
have
cards
here
signed
by
a
majority
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
--
or
i
have
no
good
faith
doubt
that
these
cards
have
been
signed
by
majority
of
my
employees
but
i
still
don't
like
cards
and
i
want
to
go
an
election.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
board
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
i
think
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
the
board
will
permit
him
to
go
on
election.
now,
let
me
put
this
case
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
correct.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
let
me
put
this
case,
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
that's
right.
now,
let
me
put
this
case.
now,
suppose
that
the
employer
when
faced
with
these
cards
he
said
--
he
would
say,
“i've
made
my
own
independent
check
of
the
employees
and
i
discovered
from
my
own
independent
check
of
the
employees
and
independently
of
your
cards
that
they
do
want
to
use
their
bargain
representative.”
now,
that
case
there,
he
will
be
required
to
bargain
with
the
union
even
though
he'd
be
not
engaged
in
any
unfair
labor
practice.
i
want
to
make
that
clear.
even
the
fourth
circuit
in
that
kind
of
a
case
would
enforce
a
bargaining
order
where
the
employer
has
made
its
own
independent
poll
of
the
employees
and
on
the
basis
of
that
he's
been
--
he
--
the
employees
have
told
him,
“yes,
we
want
this
union
a
majority
of
them.
then
even
fourth
circuit.”
the
fourth
circuit
will
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
that's
right.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
he
says,
“yes,
i
think
you
would
draw
a
line
between
those
two
and
i
don't
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
if
you
put
that
way,
it
cannot
insist
upon
an
election
when
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
he
can
not.
he
can
not
insist
upon
election
because
there
--
there
he's
not
merely
saying
in
the
case
of
mr.
justice
marshall
has
put
to
us.
he's
not
merely
saying,
i
know
you
got
cards
here,
but
he's
also
saying
that
he
knows.
he
knows
independently
of
the
cards,
independent
of
the
cards
of
the
majority
of
the
employees
have
designated
that
union.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
that's
right.
now,
to
go
on
with
the
legislative
history
that
as
i've
indicated
that
the
courts
had
uniformly
--
had
uniformly
interpreted
both
the
wagner
act
and
taft-hartley
act
to
permit
the
use
of
cards
for
union
to
demonstrate
its
majority
as
majority
status.
the
47
amendments
did
not
change
either
section
8
(a)
(5)
or
which
was
8
(5)
in
the
original
wagner
act
or
section
9
(a).
but
in
fact,
the
legislative
history
the
1947
amendments
shows
that
the
conference
committee
specifically
rejected
a
house
passed
amendments
which
have
--
where
have
relieve
the
employer,
which
we
have
a
relieve
the
employer
of
any
obligation
to
bargain
with
the
union,
which
based
its
majority
status
upon
cards.
congress
specifically
rejected
that
proposal
which
would
have
amended
section
8
(a)
(5)
so
as
to
permit
the
board
to
issue
a
bargaining
order
only
when
the
employer
was
either
refusing
to
bargain
with
the
union
that
he
was
currently
recognizing
or
a
union
which
have
been
certified
by
the
board
after
an
election.
congress
says
that
it
rejected
that
amendment,
rejected
that
amendment
and
retained
the
language
of
section
8
(a)
(5),
sections
9
(a)
which
from
the
very
beginning
of
this
statute
had
been
interpreted
both
by
the
board,
by
the
courts
as
permitting
the
use
of
cards
to
establish
a
union
as
majority
status.
the
1959
amendments
when
there
was
discussion
in
--
when
there
is
the
legislative
consideration
of
the
1959
amendments,
congress
again
took
note
of
the
fact
that
a
board
--
that
a
bargaining
obligation
under
section
8
(5),
that
the
issuance
of
a
board
bargaining
order
was
not
dependent
upon
a
board
election.
it
took
specific
note
of
board
cases
where
the
board
had
required
an
employer
to
bargain
with
the
union
which
was
representative
status
was
based
upon
cards
and
where
the
employer
had
engaged
in
misconduct
which
belies
his
good
faith
doubt.
nonetheless,
the
1959
congress
did
not
amend
the
basic
language
of
section
8
(5)
or
section
9
which
as
i
repeatedly
offset
is
the
basis
for
the
use
of
cards
as
a
means
for
establishing
union's
majority
position.
now,
its
argued
--
as
argued
very
strongly
that
cards
because
of
the
circumstances
--
because
of
the
circumstances
that
may
attend
their
procurement
are
inherently
unreliable
and
that
an
election
is
the
only
proper
way
of
safeguarding
the
employees
and
permitting
them
to
vote
their
convictions.
alright,
i
would
think
that
the
fact
that
the
congress
--
that
congress
must
have
discounted
this
argument
when
in
1947,
it
rejected
the
house
passed
amendment
which
was
where
relieved
the
employer
of
any
obligation
to
bargain
with
the
union
whose
representative
status
was
based
upon
cards.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
the
boards
was
been
using
cards
all
along
every
since
the
beginning
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
has
been
--
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
this
shift
has
been
i
think
primarily
in
this
respect
that
the
board
originally
would
say
the
employer
had
to
come
forward
with
some
objective
evidence
to
support
his
good
faith
doubt.
today
the
board
has
not
insists
that
he
come
forward
with
the
objective
evidence.
in
fact,
the
board
puts
it
burden
of
proving
the
employer's
lack
of
a
good
faith
doubt
--
puts
that
burden
upon
the
general
counsel.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
yes,
sir.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
unless
--
unless
he
had
a
good
faith
doubt
based
upon
objective
considerations.
i
would
like
phrase
it
that
way.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
all
right,
sir.
the
--
i'm
afraid
my
time
is
up.
i
have
to
leave
the
rest
of
it
to
the
brief.
this
is
a
case
that
might
have
needed
a
little
bit
more
time.
mr.
dominick
l.
manoli
thank
you
very
much.
