mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
if
i
may,
i
will
first
state
the
three
or
four
things
which
are
different
about
the
general
steel
case
in
the
context
of
this
combined
hearing.
in
general
steel,
the
union
lost
an
election.
the
result
of
the
election
was
later
set
aside
and
the
entire
election
proceeding
dismissed.
even
though,
the
board
had
previously
found
and
recorded
in
its
order
that
a
question
concerning
representation
existed,
a
finding
which
would
squarely
place
the
case
within
section
8
(c)
under
which
the
board
concedes
that
it
must
hold
an
election
in
order
to
resolve
the
questions
of
representation.
no
new
election
has
ever
been
held.
in
this
case,
the
union
was
installed
as
in
the
other
cases.
but
in
this
case,
it
was
installed
after
having
lost
a
secret
ballot
election.
in
this
case,
there
were
no
8
(a)
(3)
charges.
no
one
was
alleged
or
found.
no
individual
was
alleged
or
found
to
have
been
improperly
discriminated
against.
the
board
installed
the
union
based
entirely
upon
alleged
coercion
by
the
employer
and
alleged
failure
in
good
faith
to
recognize
the
union
upon
demand.
this
much
more
is
perhaps
different.
in
general
steel,
there
was
a
demand
by
the
union
for
recognition.
but
the
union
made
no
offer
of
proof
whatever.
i
do
not
want
to
be
taken
as
conceding
that
that
makes
a
difference
in
this
case,
but
i
want
the
court
to
be
aware
of
it.
i
think
it
makes
this
much
difference
or
the
union
fails
to
make
any
offer
of
proof
of
its
position.
it
indicates
a
lack
of
security
on
the
part
of
the
union
in
making
its
demand
and
is
certainly
something
upon
which
the
employer
can
rely
in
deciding
whether
he
believes,
the
union
really
represents
his
people.
now,
of
course
it
is
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
there
were
--
there
were
indeed
and
certain
one
of
them
isolated
instances
by
(inaudible)
supervisors
were
not
denied.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
the
impact
of
that
factor
as
i
see
it
goes
to
the
extent
of
the
unfair
labor
practices.
and
if
one
is
speaking
of
remedy,
it
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
severe
remedy
can
be
justified
in
such
a
case
which
not
only
destroys
the
right
of
the
employer
to
an
election
but
destroys
the
right
of
the
employee
to
an
election.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
i
am
arguing
that
the
statute
--
i
think
i
would
agree
with
you
as
you've
stated.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
i
think
i
would
agree
with
the
formulation
you
made.
i
may
wish
to
qualify
at
this
extent.
i
would
not
assert
that
there
is
never
a
case
where
the
board
has
no
authority
as
a
matter
of
remedy
to
order
an
employer
to
bargain.
i
do
assert
and
i
think
the
literature
is
abundant
to
support
it
that
authorization
cards
are
far
too
unreliable
a
basis
on
which
to
go
and
destroying
these
rights
which
the
act
was
primarily
set
up
to
create.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
i
think
there
may
be
issues
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
i
think
there
may
be
limited
circumstances
where
the
board
may
properly
order
bargaining
without
any
election.
i
think
the
evidence
upon
which
the
board
satisfies
itself
of
union
support
by
the
employees
ought
to
be
much
more
than
merely
authorization
cards.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
if
ever
that
comes
to
that
remedy.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
for
example
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
sehon
stevenson
which
was
one
of
the
fourth
circuit
cases
where
the
employer
has
satisfied
himself
independently
that
the
union
has
a
majority.
i
think
i
should
agree.
the
fourth
circuit
has
suggested
that
were
employer
unfair
labor
practices
are
sufficiently
aggravated
that
a
rerun
election
with
an
expected
fair
result
could
not
be
held.
even
applying
the
remedies
which
are
available
to
the
board
not
only
in
those
circumstances
should
the
board
impose
bargaining
without
giving
the
employees
an
opportunity
to
express
themselves?
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
i
do
not
agree
that
the
board
should
be
permitted
to
require
this
solely
upon
the
basis
of
cards
in
any
case.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
i
think.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
i
go
along
with
the
fair
election
an
impossible
test.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
just
before
that
i'm
insisting
however
that
the
cards
alone
are
not
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
if
i
may
expand
on
that
sir.
i
think
i
can
state
my
position.
i
had
decided
in
my
own
mind
that
i
did
not
wish
to
attempt
to
defend
the
hardest
case,
if
there
is
one.
where
the
board
and
the
courts
would
be
justified
in
concluding
that
the
employer
had
engage
in
such
outrageous
practices
that
you
could
never
within
the
reasonably
foreseeable
future
procure
them,
reassure
the
employees,
and
hold
a
valid
fair
election.
in
that
case,
i
would
be
willing
to
concede
that
after
the
application
of
the
board's
remedies
to
attempt
to
control
the
situation.
if
it
is
necessarily
concluded
that
you
still
cannot
reassure
this
people.
perhaps,
there
is
a
basis
for
further
inquiry.
the
district
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
the
trial
examiner
generalized
to
that
extent.
if
you
count
up
the
instances
in
which
he
makes
any
specific
claiming
of
fact.
you'll
find,
of
course,
this
is
rough.
i
think
about
13
employees
involved
of
the
plan
of
200
except
for
the
anti-union
speech
which
was
made
by
this
employer,
in
which
among
the
testimony
of
four
men
out
200
denied
by
the
employer.
he
has
said
to
have
said,
if
the
union
comes
in.
i
will
negotiate
and
negotiate
but
i
do
not
have
to
reach
contract
with.
and
if
you
go
out
on
strike,
i
can,
on
his
testimony
i
can
replace
you,
on
the
testimony
of
three
or
four
employees
and
said,
“if
you
go
out
on
strike.
i
have
a
right
to
end
your
job
that's
the
end
of
it,
a
very
close
line.”
the
speech
is
--
were
based
upon
letters
written
for
people,
all
of
which
passed
amongst
the
trial
examiner.
the
specific
unfair
labor
practices
involved
a
very
limited
group
and
only
three
or
four
of
those
were
undenied.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
they
were
alleged
to
have
been
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
--
in
each
of
those,
yes.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
that
is
true.
in
the
four
cases
i
believe.
and
again,
there
was
some
concession
that
one
or
two
of
those
may
have
been
adjust
and
that
they
were
all
by
(inaudible)
supervisors.
one
of
them
by
the
time
the
election
came
had
been
demoted
to
the
rank
and
file
status
not
for
this
reason
for
lack
of
competence.
we
didn't
even
know
about
till
this
came
along.
there
isn't
time
here
to
review
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
of
course.
there
hasn't
been
time
on
the
other
side.
we
feel
that
the
legislative
history
supports
the
view
that
congress
intended
to
make
an
election
the
own
limit
for
the
selection
of
a
representative.
i
think
congress
intended
probably
more
than
i'm
here
contending
for.
the
statement
in
the
house
report
on
taft-hartley
resided
a
long
list
of
what
congress
regarded
as
deprivation
of
employee
rights,
to
make
their
own
selections.
throughout
the
debates,
there
are
references
to
the
desirability
of
an
election
and
no
one
disputed
that
even
the
senators
who
ultimately
voted
against
the
taft-hartley
amendments
were
so
far
as
the
record
shows
agreeable
to
the
election
principle.
section
8
(c)
was
elaborately
rewritten
to
provide
for
an
election.
the
board's
authority
to
do
otherwise
was
removed
from
8
(c).
the
board's
authority
to
determine
a
representative
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
was
stricken
out
of
8
(c),
specifically
so.
they
had
that
authority
before
it
was
taken
out
with
the
taft-hartley
amendment
as
far
as
i
know
the
board
has
never
reconciled
that
with
its
subsequent
practice.
now,
the
board
was
already,
before
taft-hartley,
engaged
in
conducting
elections.
the
board
had
already
decided
that
in
most
cases
it
would
hold
elections
because
it
regarded
elections
as
the
reliable
way.
the
board
had
already
invented
its
good
--
its
good
faith
test
for
determining
whether
it
was
going
to
give
an
employer
an
election.
there
is
nothing
in
taft-hartley,
nothing
in
the
debates
that
i
have
found
that
shows
that
any
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
to
confirm
the
board's
existing
practice
of
counting
authorization
cards
or
to
continue
with
that
nor
to
confirm
the
board's
existing
doctrine
of
good
faith
doubt.
there
is
a
complete
absence
of
any
language
to
support
the
board's
present
position.
it
seems
to
me
in
summary
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
congressional
history
that
the
intention
was
to
make
a
change.
basically
though,
the
board
is
here
defending
the
course
of
action
which
it
was
already
pursuing.
at
that
time,
it
is
contending
that
no
change
occurred
start
talking
--
and
the
only
piece
of
legislative
history
it
hangs
it
on
is
the
failure
of
the
house
bill
amending
8
(a)
(5)
to
emerge
from
committee.
that
however
i
think
is
readily
explained,
incidentally,
this
legislative
history
is
very
well
summarized
in
a
brand
new
pamphlet
issued
by
the
wharton
school
of
university
of
pennsylvania
by
mcfarland
and
bishop.
it
just
came
out
in
february
or
january.
the
house
bill
i
was
referring
to
the
effort
to
a
mandate
file.
the
house
bill
had
gone
too
far,
not
only
with
the
house
bill
have
amended
8
(a)
(5)
to
require
an
employer
to
bargain
only
where
there
was
an
election.
it
--
it
destroyed
the
existing
relationships
based
upon
voluntary
recognition
and
the
minority
protested
against
that.
the
house
report
said
this,
“if
an
employer
is
satisfied
that
the
union
represents
the
majority
and
wishes
to
recognize
it
without
it
being
certified
on
section
9
he
is
free
to
do
so.
as
long
as
he
wishes
but
as
long
as
he
recognizes
it
or
when
it
has
been
certified,
he
must
bargain
with
it.
if
he
wishes
not
to
recognize
the
union
or
having
recognized
it
stops
doing
so,
stops
doing
so,
the
union
may
ask
for
an
election.”
well,
that
gave
him
a
right
to
recognize
today
and
withdraw
tomorrow
and
i
think
congress
right
agreed,
there
is
no
legislative
history
to
show
just
what
thoughts
went
into
this,
went
into
merged
committees
rightly
agreed
to
not
to
go
that
far.
i
believe
my
time
is
getting
close
but
let
me
suggest
this.
there
are
tremendous
disadvantages
in
a
reliance
on
cards.
there
is
lack
of
anonymity
for
the
employees.
there
is
lack
of
transfer
reflection.
they
have
no
chance
to
think
it
over
and
change
their
minds.
there
is
a
lack
of
chance
to
hear
the
other
side.
it
is
totally
inconsistent
with
the
board's
excelsior
doctrine
in
which
the
board
is
insisting
that
the
employees
be
given
a
chance
to
hear
both
sides
and
consider
this.
when
you
do
have
an
election
and
later
set
is
aside
under
the
excelsior
doctrine
the
employer
has
been
forced
to
supply
the
union
with
all
these
information
about
how
to
contact
employees
where
to
reach
them.
even
the
union,
every
opportunity
for
coercing
them,
if
it
can
get
to
them,
the
board
has
never
adopted
any
system
for
policing
these
cards
solicitations,
never.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
none
whatsoever.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
and
in
general
steel
case,
one
of
the
union's
solicitors
admitted
on
cross-examination
that
he
had
personally
dated
over
50
of
these
cards
before
presenting.
that's
at
the
very
tail
end
to
this
record
in
the
final
pages.
he
does
it,
even
though
he
was
not
the
person
who
solicited
many
of
them.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
they
must
be
dated
before
they're
presented
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
if
they
are
not,
customarily
unions
don't
date.
a
stale
card
is
no
good
and
the
union
does
not
want
to
stock
card
that
looks
stale.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
in
this
proceeding,
there
were
very
little
evidence
of
cards
being
dated
at
the
time
they
were
signed.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
sir?
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
i
don't
recall
where
the
board
has
drawn
the
line.
the
idea
of
course
is
that
they
are
too
stale
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
i
can't
decide
it
--
i
can't
decide
it
to
you.
i
think
it
is
either
just
months
or
a
year,
if
the
board
knows
it.
if
the
board
knows
but
if
the
solicitors
are
the
one
who
gathers
the
cards,
how
will
the
board
ever
know?
the
solicitor
is
he
one
who
dates
the
cards.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
the
practice
of
the
board
is
to
refuse
to
hold
any
election
if
there
is
unfair
labor
practice
charge
pending
by
any
party.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
until
it's
resolved.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
if
its
one
of
these
8
(a)
(5)
card
check
cases
and
they
order
him
to
bargain
based
upon
the
8
(a)
(5)
charge.
they
will
then
dismiss
the
election
petition
and
say,
he
is
not
entitled
to
an
election.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
that's
right.
and
they
will
dismiss
the
election
petition
at
that
point
having
the
bargain
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
if
the
union
asked
for
an
election.
they
will
hold
an
election
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
if
the
union
asked
for
an
election,
the
board
will
hold
an
election.
as
i
understand
the
rule
will
not
hold
the
election
and
face
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
then
--
then
and
this
bernel
foam
type
of
cases
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
they
will
decide
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge
first.
they
have
done
that
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
if
they
--
if
the
charge
is
sustain
there
customary
practice
is
to
assuming
it's
a
fair
charge,
a
bargain
charge.
the
customary
practice
is
to
order
bargaining
and
to
take
the
position
that
there
is
no
more
question
of
representation.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
loses
it
and
then
comes
back.
they
do
not
file
there
charges
although
they
know
about
it.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
the
union
does
not
file
its
charges
until
after
the
election
is
over.
that's
what
happened
here.
there
were
no
charges
pending
when
the
election
was
held.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
that's
right.
the
union
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
the
aiello
doctrine
which
formerly
existed
up
until
1964
for
a
period
of
10
years.
under
that
doctrine,
the
union
if
it
new
about
unfair
labor
practices
had
to
make
up
its
mind
whether
or
not
those
practices
where
sufficient
to
and

the
union
was
not
allowed
to
go
through
a
futile
election.
knowing
about
unfair
labor
practices

hamlin,

--
if
the
charges
that
would
cost
him
to
be
set
aside.
mr.

pending
a
run
off
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,

no,
sir.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
any
kind
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
brought
by
the
union
against
the
employer
pending
the
election
will
resolve
in
the
elections
being
held
up.
unless
there
union
also
files
a
way
per
se,
we
won't
use
these
charges
to
set
aside
the
election.
we'd
like
you
to
go
on
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
if
the
election
is
held
and
the
union
loses,
the
election
must
be
set
aside
before
the
board
will
entertain
an
8
(a)
(5)
charge.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
it
goes
ahead
after
the
--
after
there
has
been
a
chance
to
dissipate
the
effect
of
these
unfair
labor
practices.
it
goes
ahead
and
holds
an
election,
and
that's
what
i
am
saying.
the
board
ought
to
do
in
almost
all
of
these
cases.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
the
election
will
only
be
thrown
off
where
it
is
an
8
(5)
charge
under
which
the
board
ordered
bargain.
if
it
is
in
the
other
sort
of
charge
and
if
it's
an
8
(1),
8
(3)
charge,
the
board
will
resolved
that.
we'll
require
corrective
action
and
we'll
wait
whatever
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
--
time
is
necessary
to
dissipate
the
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
i
think
so
and
then
you
have
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
you
have
posed
a
two-union
situation
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
no,
sir.
not
merely
on
8
(1),
8
(3)
charge
and
should
not
and
i
say.
i
think
the
board's
remedies
are
ample
to
control
these
situations,
if
the
court
please.
the
board
has
the
contempt
power
of
the
court
at
its
disposal.
it
has
a
10
(j)
injunction
built
into
the
act
at
its
disposal.
it
need
not
destroy
the
employee's
right
to
an
election
or
the
employer's
right
to
an
election
in
order
to
control
unfair
labor
practices.
i
believe
my
time
is
over.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
court
please.
if
i
may,
i
will
first
state
the
three
or
four
things
which
are
different
about
the
general
steel
case
in
the
context
of
this
combined
hearing.
in
general
steel,
the
union
lost
an
election.
the
result
of
the
election
was
later
set
aside
and
the
entire
election
proceeding
dismissed.
even
though,
the
board
had
previously
found
and
recorded
in
its
order
that
a
question
concerning
representation
existed,
a
finding
which
would
squarely
place
the
case
within
section
8
(c)
under
which
the
board
concedes
that
it
must
hold
an
election
in
order
to
resolve
the
questions
of
representation.
no
new
election
has
ever
been
held.
in
this
case,
the
union
was
installed
as
in
the
other
cases.
but
in
this
case,
it
was
installed
after
having
lost
a
secret
ballot
election.
in
this
case,
there
were
no
8
(a)
(3)
charges.
no
one
was
alleged
or
found.
no
individual
was
alleged
or
found
to
have
been
improperly
discriminated
against.
the
board
installed
the
union
based
entirely
upon
alleged
coercion
by
the
employer
and
alleged
failure
in
good
faith
to
recognize
the
union
upon
demand.
this
much
more
is
perhaps
different.
in
general
steel,
there
was
a
demand
by
the
union
for
recognition.
but
the
union
made
no
offer
of
proof
whatever.
i
do
not
want
to
be
taken
as
conceding
that
that
makes
a
difference
in
this
case,
but
i
want
the
court
to
be
aware
of
it.
i
think
it
makes
this
much
difference
or
the
union
fails
to
make
any
offer
of
proof
of
its
position.
it
indicates
a
lack
of
security
on
the
part
of
the
union
in
making
its
demand
and
is
certainly
something
upon
which
the
employer
can
rely
in
deciding
whether
he
believes,
the
union
really
represents
his
people.
now,
of
course
it
is
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
there
were
--
there
were
indeed
and
certain
one
of
them
isolated
instances
by
(inaudible)
supervisors
were
not
denied.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
the
impact
of
that
factor
as
i
see
it
goes
to
the
extent
of
the
unfair
labor
practices.
and
if
one
is
speaking
of
remedy,
it
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
severe
remedy
can
be
justified
in
such
a
case
which
not
only
destroys
the
right
of
the
employer
to
an
election
but
destroys
the
right
of
the
employee
to
an
election.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
i
am
arguing
that
the
statute
--
i
think
i
would
agree
with
you
as
you've
stated.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
i
think
i
would
agree
with
the
formulation
you
made.
i
may
wish
to
qualify
at
this
extent.
i
would
not
assert
that
there
is
never
a
case
where
the
board
has
no
authority
as
a
matter
of
remedy
to
order
an
employer
to
bargain.
i
do
assert
and
i
think
the
literature
is
abundant
to
support
it
that
authorization
cards
are
far
too
unreliable
a
basis
on
which
to
go
and
destroying
these
rights
which
the
act
was
primarily
set
up
to
create.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
i
think
there
may
be
issues
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
i
think
there
may
be
limited
circumstances
where
the
board
may
properly
order
bargaining
without
any
election.
i
think
the
evidence
upon
which
the
board
satisfies
itself
of
union
support
by
the
employees
ought
to
be
much
more
than
merely
authorization
cards.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
if
ever
that
comes
to
that
remedy.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
for
example
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
sehon
stevenson
which
was
one
of
the
fourth
circuit
cases
where
the
employer
has
satisfied
himself
independently
that
the
union
has
a
majority.
i
think
i
should
agree.
the
fourth
circuit
has
suggested
that
were
employer
unfair
labor
practices
are
sufficiently
aggravated
that
a
rerun
election
with
an
expected
fair
result
could
not
be
held.
even
applying
the
remedies
which
are
available
to
the
board
not
only
in
those
circumstances
should
the
board
impose
bargaining
without
giving
the
employees
an
opportunity
to
express
themselves?
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
i
do
not
agree
that
the
board
should
be
permitted
to
require
this
solely
upon
the
basis
of
cards
in
any
case.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
i
think.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
i
go
along
with
the
fair
election
an
impossible
test.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
just
before
that
i'm
insisting
however
that
the
cards
alone
are
not
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
if
i
may
expand
on
that
sir.
i
think
i
can
state
my
position.
i
had
decided
in
my
own
mind
that
i
did
not
wish
to
attempt
to
defend
the
hardest
case,
if
there
is
one.
where
the
board
and
the
courts
would
be
justified
in
concluding
that
the
employer
had
engage
in
such
outrageous
practices
that
you
could
never
within
the
reasonably
foreseeable
future
procure
them,
reassure
the
employees,
and
hold
a
valid
fair
election.
in
that
case,
i
would
be
willing
to
concede
that
after
the
application
of
the
board's
remedies
to
attempt
to
control
the
situation.
if
it
is
necessarily
concluded
that
you
still
cannot
reassure
this
people.
perhaps,
there
is
a
basis
for
further
inquiry.
the
district
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
the
trial
examiner
generalized
to
that
extent.
if
you
count
up
the
instances
in
which
he
makes
any
specific
claiming
of
fact.
you'll
find,
of
course,
this
is
rough.
i
think
about
13
employees
involved
of
the
plan
of
200
except
for
the
anti-union
speech
which
was
made
by
this
employer,
in
which
among
the
testimony
of
four
men
out
200
denied
by
the
employer.
he
has
said
to
have
said,
if
the
union
comes
in.
i
will
negotiate
and
negotiate
but
i
do
not
have
to
reach
contract
with.
and
if
you
go
out
on
strike,
i
can,
on
his
testimony
i
can
replace
you,
on
the
testimony
of
three
or
four
employees
and
said,
“if
you
go
out
on
strike.
i
have
a
right
to
end
your
job
that's
the
end
of
it,
a
very
close
line.”
the
speech
is
--
were
based
upon
letters
written
for
people,
all
of
which
passed
amongst
the
trial
examiner.
the
specific
unfair
labor
practices
involved
a
very
limited
group
and
only
three
or
four
of
those
were
undenied.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
they
were
alleged
to
have
been
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
--
in
each
of
those,
yes.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
that
is
true.
in
the
four
cases
i
believe.
and
again,
there
was
some
concession
that
one
or
two
of
those
may
have
been
adjust
and
that
they
were
all
by
(inaudible)
supervisors.
one
of
them
by
the
time
the
election
came
had
been
demoted
to
the
rank
and
file
status
not
for
this
reason
for
lack
of
competence.
we
didn't
even
know
about
till
this
came
along.
there
isn't
time
here
to
review
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
of
course.
there
hasn't
been
time
on
the
other
side.
we
feel
that
the
legislative
history
supports
the
view
that
congress
intended
to
make
an
election
the
own
limit
for
the
selection
of
a
representative.
i
think
congress
intended
probably
more
than
i'm
here
contending
for.
the
statement
in
the
house
report
on
taft-hartley
resided
a
long
list
of
what
congress
regarded
as
deprivation
of
employee
rights,
to
make
their
own
selections.
throughout
the
debates,
there
are
references
to
the
desirability
of
an
election
and
no
one
disputed
that
even
the
senators
who
ultimately
voted
against
the
taft-hartley
amendments
were
so
far
as
the
record
shows
agreeable
to
the
election
principle.
section
8
(c)
was
elaborately
rewritten
to
provide
for
an
election.
the
board's
authority
to
do
otherwise
was
removed
from
8
(c).
the
board's
authority
to
determine
a
representative
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding
was
stricken
out
of
8
(c),
specifically
so.
they
had
that
authority
before
it
was
taken
out
with
the
taft-hartley
amendment
as
far
as
i
know
the
board
has
never
reconciled
that
with
its
subsequent
practice.
now,
the
board
was
already,
before
taft-hartley,
engaged
in
conducting
elections.
the
board
had
already
decided
that
in
most
cases
it
would
hold
elections
because
it
regarded
elections
as
the
reliable
way.
the
board
had
already
invented
its
good
--
its
good
faith
test
for
determining
whether
it
was
going
to
give
an
employer
an
election.
there
is
nothing
in
taft-hartley,
nothing
in
the
debates
that
i
have
found
that
shows
that
any
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
to
confirm
the
board's
existing
practice
of
counting
authorization
cards
or
to
continue
with
that
nor
to
confirm
the
board's
existing
doctrine
of
good
faith
doubt.
there
is
a
complete
absence
of
any
language
to
support
the
board's
present
position.
it
seems
to
me
in
summary
it
is
perfectly
clear
from
the
congressional
history
that
the
intention
was
to
make
a
change.
basically
though,
the
board
is
here
defending
the
course
of
action
which
it
was
already
pursuing.
at
that
time,
it
is
contending
that
no
change
occurred
start
talking
--
and
the
only
piece
of
legislative
history
it
hangs
it
on
is
the
failure
of
the
house
bill
amending
8
(a)
(5)
to
emerge
from
committee.
that
however
i
think
is
readily
explained,
incidentally,
this
legislative
history
is
very
well
summarized
in
a
brand
new
pamphlet
issued
by
the
wharton
school
of
university
of
pennsylvania
by
mcfarland
and
bishop.
it
just
came
out
in
february
or
january.
the
house
bill
i
was
referring
to
the
effort
to
a
mandate
file.
the
house
bill
had
gone
too
far,
not
only
with
the
house
bill
have
amended
8
(a)
(5)
to
require
an
employer
to
bargain
only
where
there
was
an
election.
it
--
it
destroyed
the
existing
relationships
based
upon
voluntary
recognition
and
the
minority
protested
against
that.
the
house
report
said
this,
“if
an
employer
is
satisfied
that
the
union
represents
the
majority
and
wishes
to
recognize
it
without
it
being
certified
on
section
9
he
is
free
to
do
so.
as
long
as
he
wishes
but
as
long
as
he
recognizes
it
or
when
it
has
been
certified,
he
must
bargain
with
it.
if
he
wishes
not
to
recognize
the
union
or
having
recognized
it
stops
doing
so,
stops
doing
so,
the
union
may
ask
for
an
election.”
well,
that
gave
him
a
right
to
recognize
today
and
withdraw
tomorrow
and
i
think
congress
right
agreed,
there
is
no
legislative
history
to
show
just
what
thoughts
went
into
this,
went
into
merged
committees
rightly
agreed
to
not
to
go
that
far.
i
believe
my
time
is
getting
close
but
let
me
suggest
this.
there
are
tremendous
disadvantages
in
a
reliance
on
cards.
there
is
lack
of
anonymity
for
the
employees.
there
is
lack
of
transfer
reflection.
they
have
no
chance
to
think
it
over
and
change
their
minds.
there
is
a
lack
of
chance
to
hear
the
other
side.
it
is
totally
inconsistent
with
the
board's
excelsior
doctrine
in
which
the
board
is
insisting
that
the
employees
be
given
a
chance
to
hear
both
sides
and
consider
this.
when
you
do
have
an
election
and
later
set
is
aside
under
the
excelsior
doctrine
the
employer
has
been
forced
to
supply
the
union
with
all
these
information
about
how
to
contact
employees
where
to
reach
them.
even
the
union,
every
opportunity
for
coercing
them,
if
it
can
get
to
them,
the
board
has
never
adopted
any
system
for
policing
these
cards
solicitations,
never.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
none
whatsoever.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
and
in
general
steel
case,
one
of
the
union's
solicitors
admitted
on
cross-examination
that
he
had
personally
dated
over
50
of
these
cards
before
presenting.
that's
at
the
very
tail
end
to
this
record
in
the
final
pages.
he
does
it,
even
though
he
was
not
the
person
who
solicited
many
of
them.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
they
must
be
dated
before
they're
presented
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
if
they
are
not,
customarily
unions
don't
date.
a
stale
card
is
no
good
and
the
union
does
not
want
to
stock
card
that
looks
stale.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
in
this
proceeding,
there
were
very
little
evidence
of
cards
being
dated
at
the
time
they
were
signed.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
sir?
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
i
don't
recall
where
the
board
has
drawn
the
line.
the
idea
of
course
is
that
they
are
too
stale
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
i
can't
decide
it
--
i
can't
decide
it
to
you.
i
think
it
is
either
just
months
or
a
year,
if
the
board
knows
it.
if
the
board
knows
but
if
the
solicitors
are
the
one
who
gathers
the
cards,
how
will
the
board
ever
know?
the
solicitor
is
he
one
who
dates
the
cards.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
the
practice
of
the
board
is
to
refuse
to
hold
any
election
if
there
is
unfair
labor
practice
charge
pending
by
any
party.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
until
it's
resolved.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
if
its
one
of
these
8
(a)
(5)
card
check
cases
and
they
order
him
to
bargain
based
upon
the
8
(a)
(5)
charge.
they
will
then
dismiss
the
election
petition
and
say,
he
is
not
entitled
to
an
election.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
that's
right.
and
they
will
dismiss
the
election
petition
at
that
point
having
the
bargain
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
if
the
union
asked
for
an
election.
they
will
hold
an
election
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
if
the
union
asked
for
an
election,
the
board
will
hold
an
election.
as
i
understand
the
rule
will
not
hold
the
election
and
face
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
then
--
then
and
this
bernel
foam
type
of
cases
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
they
will
decide
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge
first.
they
have
done
that
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
if
they
--
if
the
charge
is
sustain
there
customary
practice
is
to
assuming
it's
a
fair
charge,
a
bargain
charge.
the
customary
practice
is
to
order
bargaining
and
to
take
the
position
that
there
is
no
more
question
of
representation.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
loses
it
and
then
comes
back.
they
do
not
file
there
charges
although
they
know
about
it.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
the
union
does
not
file
its
charges
until
after
the
election
is
over.
that's
what
happened
here.
there
were
no
charges
pending
when
the
election
was
held.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
that's
right.
the
union
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
the
aiello
doctrine
which
formerly
existed
up
until
1964
for
a
period
of
10
years.
under
that
doctrine,
the
union
if
it
new
about
unfair
labor
practices
had
to
make
up
its
mind
whether
or
not
those
practices
where
sufficient
to
and
fairly
than
election.
the
union
was
not
allowed
to
go
through
a
futile
election.
knowing
about
unfair
labor
practices
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
--
if
the
charges
that
would
cost
him
to
be
set
aside.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
pending
a
run
off
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
any
kind
of
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
brought
by
the
union
against
the
employer
pending
the
election
will
resolve
in
the
elections
being
held
up.
unless
there
union
also
files
a
way
per
se,
we
won't
use
these
charges
to
set
aside
the
election.
we'd
like
you
to
go
on
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
if
the
election
is
held
and
the
union
loses,
the
election
must
be
set
aside
before
the
board
will
entertain
an
8
(a)
(5)
charge.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
it
goes
ahead
after
the
--
after
there
has
been
a
chance
to
dissipate
the
effect
of
these
unfair
labor
practices.
it
goes
ahead
and
holds
an
election,
and
that's
what
i
am
saying.
the
board
ought
to
do
in
almost
all
of
these
cases.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
the
election
will
only
be
thrown
off
where
it
is
an
8
(5)
charge
under
which
the
board
ordered
bargain.
if
it
is
in
the
other
sort
of
charge
and
if
it's
an
8
(1),
8
(3)
charge,
the
board
will
resolved
that.
we'll
require
corrective
action
and
we'll
wait
whatever
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
--
time
is
necessary
to
dissipate
the
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
i
think
so
and
then
you
have
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
you
have
posed
a
two-union
situation
--
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
lewis
p.
hamlin,
jr.
no,
sir.
not
merely
on
8
(1),
8
(3)
charge
and
should
not
and
i
say.
i
think
the
board's
remedies
are
ample
to
control
these
situations,
if
the
court
please.
the
board
has
the
contempt
power
of
the
court
at
its
disposal.
it
has
a
10
(j)
injunction
built
into
the
act
at
its
disposal.
it
need
not
destroy
the
employee's
right
to
an
election
or
the
employer's
right
to
an
election
in
order
to
control
unfair
labor
practices.
i
believe
my
time
is
over.
