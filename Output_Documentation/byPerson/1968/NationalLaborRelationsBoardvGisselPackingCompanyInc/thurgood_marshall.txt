justice
thurgood

well,
is
there
any
magic
in
what
words
he
says
when
he
rejects
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
in
these
cases
here,
there's
nothing
on
the
language
that
was
used
to
reject
in
the
cause.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
nothing
significant
about
the
language
in
these
cases
that
was
used
in
rejecting
the
cause,
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
draw
up
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
draw
the
line
then
between
in
saying
that
i
have
no
doubt
--
good
faith
doubt
that
these
are
the
signatures.
and
he
is
saying
that
i
have
no
doubt
that
you
do
represent
the
majority.
you
draw
a
line
between
those
two.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
he
says,
i
have
no
doubt
that
these
are
the
signatures
of
51%
of
my
employees
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
51%
of
the
employees
want
you
but
i
still
want
an
election.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
gore,
do
i
understand
your
position
that
the
when
the
union
comes
in
and
says,
here
are
the
cards.
and
the
employer
says,
“thanks,
i'm
going
to
ask
for
an
election.”
no
more.
that
is
if
employer
is
in
good
shape?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
you'd
ask
an
election
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
i
understand
you
correctly
to
say
that
your
client
wanted
an
election?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
didn't
want
to
ask
for
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
knew
you
could
have
petitioned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
whether
or
not
the
board
granted
it,
you
have
a
right
to
petition
for
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
did
you
also
realize
that
if
you
petition
and
you
continue
these
unfair
labor
practices,
you
would
be
in
deeper
trouble?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
i
understand
that
once
you
ask
for
the
petition
for
the
election,
you
have
all
the
freedoms
of
speech
and
then
by
all
set.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
didn't?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
--
you
didn't
petition
for
your
election
and
you
did
exercise
which
you
thought
was
freedom
of
speech
but
we're
actually
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
thurgood
marshall
despite
what
the
law
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
despite
what
the
law
says?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
you
really
mean
is
that
what
you
think
is
freedom
of
speech
is
one
thing
and
what
they
are
now
law
be
thinks
that
freedom
of
speech
is
another
thing,
and
what
the
law
says
freedom
of
speech
is
a
very
thing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so
you
choose
to
take
the
other
side
instead
of
petition.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
did
you
write
to
file
the
paper
with
the
union?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
it
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
promptly,
would
the
union's
petition
get
faster
action
in
the
employers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn't
try
it
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
about
the
other
cases?
yes,
you
didn't
try
it
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall

to
know
what
it.
justice
thurgood

what
doesn't
company
counsel
know
that
the
employer
can
ask
for
an

petition
for
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
wouldn't
she
be
in

if
he
did?
justice
thurgood

right
now?
