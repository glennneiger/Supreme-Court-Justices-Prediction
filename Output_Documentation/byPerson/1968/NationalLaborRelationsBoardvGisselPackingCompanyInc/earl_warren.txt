mr.

--
chief

earl
warren
you
may
answer
fully
after
this.
mr.
gore,
you
may
continue
with
your
arguments.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
yesterday?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
how
may
i
--
may
i
ask
about
what
the
very
difference
there
is
between
you
and
mr.
manoli
about
who
must
initiate
this
election
in
the
circumstances
of
mr.
justice
black's
question.
as
i
understood
you,
you
said
that
it
was
then
the
duty
of
the
employer
to
request
election
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
and
i
understood
that
mr.
manoli
thought
it
was
the
employees
which
should
go
forward
with
demanding
an
election.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
understand
that
to
be
the
position
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
are
there
other
decisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
pro
or
con
on
that
subject
in
the
past.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
think
it's
crucial
for
us
to
find
in
this
case
whether
the
obligation
in
those
circumstances
is
on
the
employer
or
the
union
to
file
for
the
election.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
the
only
way
you
can
relieve
himself
of
that
is
through
demand
an
election?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes.
yes,
yes
that's
absolutely
correct.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
and
mr.
manoli
are
in
distinct
disagreement
on
that
are
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jenkins.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
did
ask
and
you
didn't
get
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
might
not
make
it
necessarily
futile
act
for
you
to
ask
where
there
were
not,
would
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
the
board
found
here
did
it
not
that
you
--
the
company
had
been
guilty
of
unfair
labor
practices
before
any
presentation
of
these
signatures?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
are
told
that
if
they
got
talking
to
union
men,
you
blank
the
blank
things
will
go,
didn't
they
or
didn't
they
find
that
coerced
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
is
before
the
cards
were
submitted.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
jenkins,
if
--
as
i
understand
that
the
reason
you
didn't
apply
for
an
election
yourself
here
was
because
you
thought
it
would
be
afforded
to
do
it.
now,
if
you
had
the
rights
in
this
case
to
file
for
the
election
yourselves,
would
you
feel
that
was
in
accordance
with
the
law
and
would
protect
your
rights
adequately?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference
why
would
you
object
so
much
to
initiating
the
election
yourself.
you
said
you
wanted
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
whether
your
rights
would
be
protected
in
that
manner,
why
would
you
fight
for
the
other
position
if
it
made
no
difference?
