mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
thank
you
sir.
gentlemen,
you
heard
all
the
confusions
here
about
the
state
of
law
in
the
hands
of
the
experts
here.
i
think
its
little
wonder
that
my
client
when
approached
by
a
union
in
light
of
all
these
and
say,
i
have
no
comment.
and
this
is
what
he
said
--
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
no
comment.
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
the
union
presents
to
a
company
and
i
think
we
have
to
be
realistic
about
this
gentlemen.
we
can
get
up
on
the
levels
that
we
like
to
speak
and
say
that
this
is
the
way
the
law
is
and
this
is
the
way
it
ought
to
be
but
i
think
we've
got
to
get
down
and
put
ourselves
in
the
level
of
the
employer
standing
there
when
the
union
official
comes
out
of
the
blue,
presents
cards
to
him
as
to
what
should
he
do
and
what
can
be
do.
and
i
think
we
also
have
to
put
a
more
importantly,
i
think,
we
have
to
put
ourselves
in
the
position
of
the
employee
when
the
union
official
comes
to
his
home
and
says,
“i'd
like
for
you
to
sign
a
union
card.”
the
employee
says
for
example,
“what's
this
all
about?”
the
union
official
says,
“well,
we're
trying
to
get
in
over
the
company.”
well,
the
employee
says,
“has
everybody
else
signed?”
“yes,
mostly
everybody
else
has
signed.”
so
he
signs
his
name.
or
friend
next
door
comes
over
and
says,
“jim,
how
about
signing
this
for
me.”
so,
he
signs
his
mine.
the
employee
not
fully
understanding
in
a
many
instances
not
understanding
at
all
what
it
is
that
he
is
doing.
the
board
through
its
rules
have
limited
the
evidence
which
can
be
presented
in
the
appellant
court
in
this
regard
because
the
trial
examiners
will
not
even
accept
evidence
as
to
the
motive
behind
the
signing
of
a
union
card.
in
most
instances
absence
that
is,
threats
or
coercions
on
the
part
of
the
solicitor
of
the
card.
so,
this
is
the
basis
of
what
we
have
gentlemen.
we
have
this
cards
that
are
signed
and
virtually
any
circumstances
--
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
well,
i'm
going
to
ask
for
a
printing
of
the
record
in
that
regard
for
--
from
his
remarks
and
present
that
to
the
next
trial
examiner
that
i
have
because
that
is
the
certain
new
to
me
--
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
it
is
not
the
board's
position
--
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
--
assuming
that
it
is.
assuming
that
it
is
and
i
would
say
--
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
alright.
assuming
that
it
is
the
position
of
the
board
that
if
presented,
the
employer
presented
with
a
demand
on
the
behalf
of
the
union.
the
employer
says,
“well,
i
don't
think
you
represent
the
majority.
i'm
going
to
file
and
let
you
petition.”
i
think
this
is
perfectly
proper.
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
this
is
correct.
this
is
what
has
been
said
that
he
can
do
it.
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
sir?
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
if
the
employer
says,
i'm
not
going
to
do
anything.
i
think
this
would
solve
the
problem
to
an
extent.
i
think
this
is
not
the
answer
though.
we're
not
--
i
would
like
the
court
to
give
us
some
guidance
as
to
what
to
do
here
rather
than
to
come
up
with
a
negative
expressions
because
we're
on
the
firing
line
here.
we
don't
know
what
really
to
do.
the
union
doesn't
know
what
to
do.
the
company
counsels
do
not
know
what
to
do
in
this
regard.
the
client
says,
“the
union
may
have
sit
in
my
other
room,
what
do
i
do?
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
yes,
sir.
he
should
know.
he
should
know
that
the
employer
has
a
right
to
ask
for
an
election
but
like
mr.
jenkins
said,
“time
and
time,
time
and
time
again
we've
asked
for
these
elections.
the
board
almost
administratively
rejects
our
petition.”
the
union
files
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge,
so
where
are
we?
we
have
no
right
to
appeal
this
administrative
rejection
on
the
part
of
the
board.
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
would
we
better
in
shape
than
we
did?
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
would
i
be
in
better
shape?
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
i
think
not.
no,
sir.
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
i
think
that
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
in
these
cases
if
we
had
filed
a
petition
for
an
election
that
the
board
would
have
rejected
the
petition
based
on
the
unfair
labor
practice
of
the
union
which
was
found
shortly
after
the
--
a
company
conducted
its
investigations
in
these
cases
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
union
had
a
majority.
you've
got
to
remember
gentlemen
in
this
one
case,
in
the
heck's
case,
in
warehouse
case,
the
union
came
to
the
company.
they
had
13
cards,
there
were
26
employees
in
the
bargaining
unit
said,
“we
represent
a
majority.”
they
did
not
represent
the
majority
and
the
board
so
held.
now
the
next
day,
they
came
up.
they
got
another
card
then
send
a
letter
to
the
union
without
relating
the
fact
that
they
had
secured
additional
card.
they
send
a
letter
to
the
union
or
the
company
said,
“confirming
our
conversation
of
yesterday,
we
--
or
last
week,
we
demand
recognition
and
bargaining
rights.”
well,
nothing
has
come
to
the
mind
of
the
company
which
would
indicate
that
the
union
had
later
secured
its
bargaining
rights.
now,
one
more
point
that
i
think
is
very
a
significant
gentlemen
and
that
is
this
matter
of
good
faith.
the
mere
fact
that
a
company
commits
unfair
labor
practices
before,
during,
or
after
a
demand
for
recognition
in
my
judgment
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
his
state
of
mind
in
declining
to
recognize
a
union
on
his
down
for
the
union
represents
the
majority.
the
union
says
and
the
board
says
that,
if
unfair
labor
practices
occur
after
the
demand,
he
could
not
have
had
good
faith
when
he
denied
it.
this
doesn't
make
sense.
now,
if
you
want
to
punish
the
company
for
this
then
this
is
alright.
this
is
a
punishment.
but
if
you
want
to
say
that
because
they
committed
unfair
labor
practices,
he
did
not
have
a
good
faith.
then
gentlemen,
this
is
not
sound
reasoning.
now,
it
is
--
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
he
could
still
have
a
good
faith
doubt
that
the
union
represents
the
majority
and
fire
him.
yes,
sir.
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
they
fired
the
man
that
the
company
was
under
the
impression
that
he
was
a
supervisor.
it
turned
out
that
the
board
held
it
was
not.
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
yes,
sir.
but
--
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
well,
this
is
a
good
point
your
honor
because
--
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
--
when
the.
now,
when
the
union
in
this
case
made
a
demand
--
made
its
demand,
it's
over
the
man's
recognition.
it
did
not
represent
the
majority
and
the
board
so
held.
so
the
good
faith
bound
to
have
been
there
because
of
the
fact
was
there
and
nothing
came
to
the
company
as
i
say
which
would
indicate
to
the
union
later
mastered
up
another
card
to
get
it
that
one
over
one
half.
but
now,
if
you
want
to
punish
the
companies
because
of
their
subsequent
unfair
labor
practice
by
throwing
this
plum
to
the
union
that
is
the
employees
and
these
are
his
rights,
the
national
labor
relations
board
suppose
to
be
protecting.
if
you
want
to
this
plum
to
the
union
as
a
punishment
to
the
company
then
of
course
this
is
one
thing.
but
merely
to
say
that
there
subsequent
unfair
labor
practices
negate
the
possibility
of
good
faith
and
it
is
in
the
first
instances
to
me
does
not
sound
reasonable.
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
but
the
--
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
oh,
it
would
be
in
my
brief,
i
see
my
time
is
up,
that
cards
are
valid
for
the
purpose
of
nomination
but
they're
not
valid
for
the
purpose
of
election.
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
yes,
sir.
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
yes,
sir.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
mr.
frederick

and
the
board
so
held.
so
the
good
faith
bound
to
have
been
there
because
of
the
fact
was
there
and
nothing
came
to
the
company
as
i
say
which
would
indicate
to
the
union
later
mastered
up
another
card
to
get
it
that
one
over
one
half.
but
now,
if
you
want
to
punish
the
companies
because
of
their
subsequent
unfair
labor
practice
by
throwing
this
plum
to
the
union
that
is
the
employees
and
these
are
his
rights,
the
national
labor
relations
board
suppose
to
be
protecting.
if
you
want
to
this
plum
to
the
union
as
a
punishment
to
the
company
then
of
course
this
is
one
thing.
but
merely
to
say
that
there
subsequent
unfair
labor
practices
negate
the
possibility
of
good
faith
and
it
is
in
the
first
instances
to
me
does
not
sound
reasonable.

the
--
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
oh,
it
would
be
in
my
brief,
i
see
my
time
is
up,
that
cards
are
valid
for
the
purpose
of
nomination
but
they're
not
valid
for
the
purpose
of
election.
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
yes,
sir.
mr.
frederick
f.
holroyd
yes,
sir.
thank
you,
gentlemen.
