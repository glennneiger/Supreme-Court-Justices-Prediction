justice
hugo
l.
black
on
what
grounds
did
they
question?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
a
question
to
see
if
i
clearly
understand
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
the
difference
between
you.
as
i
understand,
you
take
the
position
that
when
the
employees
give
cards
to
the
employer,
he
has
a
right
under
the
law
say,
“alright,
i
don't
want
to
do
this.
i
prefer
an
election.”
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
he
can
answer
to
the
election
not
--
the
union
doesn't
have
to
ask
for
it
but
he
can
ask
for
it.
and
that
after
he
asked
for
it,
you
have
an
election
in
which
you
have
the
same
rights
and
free
speech
as
both
sides
as
though
the
union
had
asked
for
an
election.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
they
say
it
was
his
duty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
did
they
say
it
was
his
duty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
his
failure
to
file?
justice
hugo
l.
black
whether
he
has
a
right?
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
has
a
right
to
file
for
an
election,
doesn't
he?
which
the
board
could
knock
him
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
either
one
of
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
why
shouldn't
he
file
it
if
he
is
not
satisfied
with
the
card?
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
didn't
you
file
it
any
how?
we
can
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
was
a
question
passed
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
was
it
thrown
out?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
--
gets
him.
have
you
been
guilty
of
any
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what?
justice
hugo
l.
black
had
you
been
guilty
of
any
unfair
labor
case
--
practice
in
this
case?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
did
they
found
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
that
was
on
the
card
issues.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
you
have
fraud
on
an
election
before
that
hearing
was
held
on
that
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
was
the
only
way
you
asked
about
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
it
doesn't
say
much.
you
said
it
can
if
you
want
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
not
if
there's
one
declining
to
give
it
to
him?
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
company
is
the
one
that's
declining
to
give
it
to
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
page
of
the
brief
did
you
say
that
was
on?
justice
hugo
l.
black
alright.
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
i
understand
you
to
concede
that
if
the
company
had
made
a
statement
that
the
union
won,
it
intended
to
move
its
plant
and
that
was
a
truthful
statement.
that
would
amend
a
ground
for
holding
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
that
would've
been
a
ground
for
holding
if
there
was
coercion
on
the
employee?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
was
the
truth?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
was
the
truth?
that's
what
i
asked.
justice
hugo
l.
black
in
other
words,
you
couldn't
tell
them
that
what
are
you
--
he
is
going
to
do,
if
they
win?
if
the
unions
won?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
he
really
intended
to
do
it.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i
don't
say
that
one
way
or
the
other,
i
just
asked
if
that
was
what
you
conceded?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
if
it
wins,
i
said
if
the
union
wins
