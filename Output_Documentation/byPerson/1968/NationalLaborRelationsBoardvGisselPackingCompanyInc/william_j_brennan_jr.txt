here
so
that

does
the

have

right
in

(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,

same
right
or

justice

brennan,

say
this
is
much
but
no
more
than
(inaudible).
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
that's
the
board's
position?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

what
is
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

or
not
to
sign
out

justice
william
j.
brennan,

i
don't
like
you
keep
repeating
myself
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
with
this
--
at
least
i
think
(inaudible).
now,
i
correctly
understand
the
board's
position
to
lead
that
the
only
time
that
an
employer
is
not
bound
with
the
court's
decision
based
upon
cards
and
the
other
situations
of
private
election
in
that
situation
which
you
(inaudible)
of
serious
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
employer
--
that
the
employer
might
say,
i
don't
believe
in
cards
and
i
don't
think
you
guys
you
need
to
certify.
and
then
he
just
makes
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
then
--
then
the
union
will
ask
him
about
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
apparently
not
to
be
those
committed
before
the
union
asked
him
to
recognize
that
it
would
be
unfair
labor
practices
afterwards?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
even
that
they
did.
that
the
first
they
ever
heard
to
your
campaign
was
(inaudible)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
said,
“i
want
an
election.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
he
goes
to
commit
some
unfair
labor
practice
by
the
same
rule?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
--
when
they
say,
no,
i
want
an
election,
under
your
view?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean,
he
can
--
may
not
insist
upon
the
union
secret
election
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
may
himself
say,
i
won't
now
write
the
board
for
an
election.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
--
that
sort
of
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
through
the
government's
little
deed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
uh-huh.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
employer
though
wouldn't
necessarily
give
the
election?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
would
he
give
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
answering
my
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
answering
my
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
i
come
back
with
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
come
back
to
what
i
said
to
you
earlier?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
understand
it,
what
you're
telling
us
is
that
in
your
view,
the
union
comes
into
the
employer
and
although
the
employer
may
have
no
quarrel
with
you
about
the
authenticity
of
signatures,
no
quarrel
with
you
about
the
number
of
cards
as
representing
the
majority
in
the
appropriate
bargaining
unit.
nevertheless,
i
mean
the
employers
not
required
to
bargain
if
instead,
he
files
his
own
petition
with
the
board
requesting
an
election,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
see
--
i
just
don't
see
how
much
difference
there
is
between
you
and
what
mr.
manoli
told?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
--
are
there
any
cases
that
you
know
of
which
articulates
the
view
that
mr.
manoli
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
in
that
respect
mr.
gore,
do
i
understand
you
correctly.
the
employer
doesn't
have
to
do
anything
when
the
union
comes
with
the
cards,
if
he
wants
to
say,
“no,
i'm
going
to
file
a
petition
for
an
election.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
if
he
does
that,
he
doesn't
have
to
check
cards.
he
doesn't
have
to
do
anything?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
doesn't
have
to
make
any
comment
of
any
kind.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
a
time
limit
for
the
completion
of
proceedings
under
employers'
petition?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
a
time
limit
on
the
completion
of
proceedings
under
the
unions'
petition?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
the
--
how
does
it
come
about
then
the
union
sometimes
asks
for
an
election
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
until
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
well
of
course
this
is
six
months
status
let
me
tell
you
on
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
charge
now.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
you
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
says,
depending
a
request
for
an
election
and
then
--
but
there
are
unfair
labor
practices
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
now
its
pending
--
pending
--
does
it
make
any
difference
what
kind
of
a
charge
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge
is
as
to
whether
or
not
they
will
go
forward
with
an
election?
does
it
have
to
be
8
(a)
(5)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
any
kind
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
assume
they
hold
the
--
they
resolve
the
unfair
labor
practices
charges
against
the
employer
and
then
will
they
ordering
to
bargain
automatically
no
matter
what
kind
of
unfair
labor
practice
charge
it
was
or
does
it
depend
on
whether
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge
might
obtain
at
the
election?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
--
but
i
suppose
there's
a
petition
for
an
election.
union
files
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
except
the
hypothesis
that
the
charge
does
not
necessarily
bear
upon
the
fairness
of
the
election.
as
i
understand
the
practice,
the
board
hears
the
charge
holding
any
action
on
the
election
petition.
suppose
it's
found
that
the
charge
is
sustained
but
that
it
is
not
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
employer
that
will
interfere
with
the
conduct
of
a
fair
election.
what
does
the
board
do
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
know
i'm
just
thinking
of
a
situation,
i
suppose
must
have
happen
sometimes.
you
have
competing
unions
in
the
plant
and
the
employer
commits
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
let's
say
demoting.
one
of
those
opponents
of
one
the
unions
but
the
union
that
gets
the
cards
is
the
other
union.
and
it's
the
one
that
then
seeks
recognition
and
the
employer
says,
“no,
i'll
have
a
file
election
petition”,
and
he
does.
then
there's
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
in
connection
with
the
demotion
of
the
employee
active
for
the
union
that
lost
out
with
the
employee.
you
mean,
if
they
find
in
that
situation
that
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge
is
sustained.
they'll
not
be
in
election
involving
the
other
union?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we'll
wait?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
under
situation
that
i
suppose,
hypothesis.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
gore,
before
you
start.
is
there
any
legislation
pending
bill
on
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
would
like
disallow
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
would
it
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
no.
we
don't
need
it
but
it
would
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
at
stake
in
this
case
or
by
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
petition
really
held
have
a
suspension
in
saying
towards
it
is
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
do
you
elect
to
do
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
without
the
person's
deciding
the
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
it
is
discussed
in
page
191.
it
was
the
topic
by
the
board
and
the
examiner,
is
that
what
you're
referring
to?
by
the
board
elections,
it's
probably
the
best
method
concerning
whether
an
employee's
desire
to
be
represented
by
a
bargaining
agent.
whereas
here,
an
employer
engages
an
unfair
labor
practices
which
may
come
possible
holding
to
a
free
election.
there
is
no
alternative
but
to
look
at
the
signed
authorization
cards
as
the
only
available
proof
for
the
choice
employees
would
have
absent
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
it.
well,
there's
no
reference
here
though
to
unfit
--
to
whether
or
not
you
would
have
a
doubt.
i
don't
find
in
that
language.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice

don't
go,
don't
waste
your
time
looking
for
this.
it
is
somewhere
else's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
in
the
order.
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i
was
referring
to
and
i
couldn't
find
it.
the
language
i
read
to
you
was
the
only
thing
that
i
have
come
across.
don't
waste
your
time.

does

say
this
is

i
don't

with

at

i

now,
i
correctly

the

might

i
don't

and

don't

and
then
he
just
makes
it

and
then

then
the

will
ask

about

not

that

and
he
said,
“i

and
then
he
goes
to
commit
some
unfair

by
the

rule?

when
--
when
they
say,
no,
i
want
an

under
your
view?
justice
william

you
mean,
he
can

may
not
insist
upon

but
he
may

justice

just
any
kind
of
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
assume
they
hold
the
--
they
resolve
the
unfair
labor
practices
charges
against
the
employer
and
then
will
they
ordering
to
bargain
automatically
no
matter
what
kind
of
unfair
labor
practice
charge
it
was
or
does
it
depend
on
whether
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge
might
obtain
at
the
election?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what
--
but
i
suppose
there's
a
petition
for
an
election.
union
files
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
except
the
hypothesis
that
the
charge
does
not
necessarily
bear
upon
the
fairness
of
the
election.
as
i
understand
the
practice,
the
board
hears
the
charge
holding
any
action
on
the
election
petition.
suppose
it's
found
that
the
charge
is
sustained
but
that
it
is
not
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
employer
that
will
interfere
with
the
conduct
of
a
fair
election.
what
does
the
board
do
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
know
i'm
just
thinking
of
a
situation,
i
suppose
must
have
happen
sometimes.
you
have
competing
unions
in
the
plant
and
the
employer
commits
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
let's
say
demoting.
one
of
those
opponents
of
one
the
unions
but
the
union
that
gets
the
cards
is
the
other
union.
and
it's
the
one
that
then
seeks
recognition
and
the
employer
says,
“no,
i'll
have
a
file
election
petition”,
and
he
does.
then
there's
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
in
connection
with
the
demotion
of
the
employee
active
for
the
union
that
lost
out
with
the
employee.
you
mean,
if
they
find
in
that
situation
that
the
unfair
labor
practice
charge
is
sustained.
they'll
not
be
in
election
involving
the
other
union?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we'll
wait?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
even
under
situation
that
i
suppose,
hypothesis.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
gore,
before
you
start.
is
there
any
legislation
pending
bill
on
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
would
like
disallow
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
would
it
be?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
no.
we
don't
need
it
but
it
would
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
that
what
at
stake
in
this
case
or
by
the
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
the
petition
really
held
have
a
suspension
in
saying
towards
it
is
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
do
you
elect
to
do
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
this
is
without
the
person's
deciding
the
unfair
labor
practice?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
think
it
is
discussed
in
page
191.
it
was
the
topic
by
the
board
and
the
examiner,
is
that
what
you're
referring
to?
by
the
board
elections,
it's
probably
the
best
method
concerning
whether
an
employee's
desire
to
be
represented
by
a
bargaining
agent.
whereas
here,
an
employer
engages
an
unfair
labor
practices
which
may
come
possible
holding
to
a
free
election.
there
is
no
alternative
but
to
look
at
the
signed
authorization
cards
as
the
only
available
proof
for
the
choice
employees
would
have
absent
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
it.
well,
there's
no
reference
here
though
to
unfit
--
to
whether
or
not
you
would
have
a
doubt.
i
don't
find
in
that
language.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
don't
go,
don't
waste
your
time
looking
for
this.
it
is
somewhere
else's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
in
the
order.
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
what
i
was
referring
to
and
i
couldn't
find
it.
the
language
i
read
to
you
was
the
only
thing
that
i
have
come
across.
don't
waste
your
time.
