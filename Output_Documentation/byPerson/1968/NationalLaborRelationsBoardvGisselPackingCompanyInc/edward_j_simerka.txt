mr.
edward
j.
simerka
excuse
me.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
would
like
to
get
immediately
into
the
reason
why
we
are
here.
in
december
of
1965,
the
teamsters
union
lost
an
nlrb
election
which
was
held
among
employees
classified
as
journeymen
wire
weavers
at
our
plant
on
holyoke,
massachusetts.
they
voted
seven
against
the
union
and
six
for
the
union.
now,
even
though
the
union
lost
the
election,
the
labor
board
ordered
us
to
bargain
with
it
and
why
did
the
labor
board
do
this?
they
did
it
because
of
our
words,
because
of
what
we
said
to
our
employees
prior
to
a
conduct
of
this
election.
unlike
the
other
cases
that
have
been
heard
this
afternoon,
there
were
no
discharges,
there
was
no
interrogation,
there
was
no
surveillance,
and
there
were
no
promises
of
benefit
by
the
employer
in
this
case.
now,
during
the
organizing
campaign,
president
david
sinclair
made
two
speeches
to
the
employees
and
he
wrote
about
eight
letters
for
handbills.
now,
in
its
decision,
the
board
could
not
find
a
single
statement.
they
couldn't
find
a
single
sentence
or
a
single
communication
which
they
could
characterize
as
being
unlawful.
so,
instead,
what
the
board
said
in
fact
was
that
even
though
each
of
the
employer's
statements
was
lawful
by
itself
considered
separately,
we,
the
board
in
our
expertise
seating
here
in
washington
will
decide
that
the
totality
of
all
these
lawful
statements
however
are
unlawful
and
are
coercive,
and
that
is
why
we
are
here.
it
is
our
position
that
our
communications
to
our
employees
were
lawful
and
protected
not
only
by
section
8
(c)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
but
also
by
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution.
now,
we
would
like
to
meet
the
issues
head-on
and
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
21
of
the
board's
brief.
the
board's
attorneys
call
attention
on
page
21
of
their
brief
to
five
points
that
allegedly
were
made
by
president
david
sinclair
in
petitioner's
communications.
i'm
using
the
term
board's
attorneys
advisedly
because
the
board
nowhere
indicated
that
it
relied
upon
these
five
points
or
upon
any
other
points.
the
only
finding
that
we
have
from
the
board
is
that
by
petitioner's
series
of
communications
that
when
they
were
considered
as
a
whole
that
these
were
coercive
but
the
board
at
no
time
ever
indicated
as
to
what
it
was
specifically
that
we
had
said
at
narrative
proscription.
that's
why
i
point
to
page
21
of
the
board's
brief
because
the
board's
attorneys
point
to
five
points
which
they
say
we
made
and
these
five
points
i
gather
which
made
--
allegedly
made
our
communications
coercive
in
the
board's
view.
now,
of
course
the
board's
attorneys
merely
expanded
upon
an
approach
taken
by
the
court
below
which
did
much
the
same
thing
relying
upon
four
points.
again,
which
there
are
no
evidence
were
relied
on
by
the
board.
now,
we
submit
that
each
of
the
five
statements
or
points
that
are
referred
to
in
the
board's
brief
were
lawful
and
protected
by
section
8
(c)
and
by
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution.
point
number
one,
for
example
is
that
the
1952
strike
left
the
company
in
a
state
of
continuing
financial
difficulty.
now,
of
course
the
facts
in
our
case
are
that
we
did
have
a
union
for
journeymen
and
at
the
time
apprentice
wire
weavers
up
until
1952
and
there
was
a
13-week
strike.
and
in
our
communications,
we
told
the
employees
that
the
1952
strike
of
13
weeks
duration
had
left
the
company
in
a
continuing
state
of
financial
difficulty
and
we
submit
that
this
statement
is
perfectly
lawful
and
proper
under
section
8
(c)
of
the
act
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
can
it
be
acclaimed
to
contain
a
threat
or
force
or
reprisal
on
our
part,
certainly
is
not
a
promise
of
benefit.
further,
the
statement
is
amply
supported
by
the
record
and
i
point
out
that
this
court
has
held
that
no
test
of
truth
can
be
administered
either
by
judges
or
juries
or
by
administrative
agencies
when
questions
of
free
speech
were
involved
but
the
record
does
support
this
statement
and
it
shows
that
the
financial
difficulties
over
the
years
became
so
severe
that
in
1964
president
david
sinclair
was
forced
to
sell
his
family-owned
company.
now,
we
assume
that
even
the
board
will
agree
with
us
that
statement
number
one
which
the
board
is
relying
on
is
a
statement
lawful
and
protected
under
8
(c)
and
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
it's
on
page
21,
your
honor,
of
the
board.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
now,
the
second
statement
that
the
board
relies
upon
is
a
statement
that
a
petitioner
stated
that
a
union
would
make
unreasonable
demands
which
the
company
could
not
meet
and
then
its
only
recourse
would
be
a
strike.
well,
i'm
not
going
to
quibble
over
the
wording.
we
made
statements
substantially
to
of
that
nature
in
the
course
of
the
pre-election
campaign.
but
we
submit
that
anyone
knows
that
this
statement,
that
is
that
if
the
company
cannot
meet
unreasonable
demands
that
the
union's
only
recourse
is
the
strike,
is
a
true
statement.
it
doesn't
take
board
expertise
to
determine
this.
now,
we
submit
that
a
statement
of
this
nature
also
is
lawful
and
protected
under
section
8
(c)
under
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution.
to
the
extent
that
there
may
be
involved
a
charge
that
a
union
or
the
union
or
the
teamsters
union
would
make
unreasonable
demands,
we
submit
that
this
is
lawful
and
protected.
it's
a
statement
relevant
to
the
issues
and
in
linn
against
plant
guards.
this
court
recognized
that
a
wide
scope
was
to
be
given
in
a
pre-election
campaign
of
charges
and
counter-charges.
now,
and
it
doesn't
take
board
expertise
to
know
that
unions
do
make
unreasonable
demands.
everyone
knows
this.
this
is
the
name
of
the
game.
this
is
the
basis
upon
which
negotiations
start
in
any
labor
management
context
and
the
people
in
the
plant
know
this,
and
particularly
these
people
and
this
plant
knew
it
because
they'd
all
been
union
members
back
in
--
i
should
amend
my
statement
of
all,
a
majority
of
them
have
been
members
of
the
union
back
in
1952
and
anyone
who
negotiates
labor
contracts
as
i
have
know
this
also.
now,
in
addition,
here,
there
is
a
background
of
a
strike
over
unreasonable
demands
in
1952.
the
majority
of
the
employees
involved
in
this
election
campaign
went
through
the
1952
strike.
they
knew
what
the
unreasonable
demands
were
back
in
1952
that
led
to
that
strike.
now,
we
submit
that
neither
section
8
(c)
nor
the
constitution
permits
the
board
to
shield
employees
from
something
they
already
know.
basically,
this
is
the
substance
of
statement
number
2
that
is
relied
upon
by
the
board.
now,
what
else
did
we
do
according
to
the
board's
attorneys?
three,
according
to
the
board's
attorneys,
we
pointed
out
to
the
employees
that
such
a
recourse
that
is
unreasonable
demands
was
particularly
to
be
expected
from
the
teamsters
union
which
was
a
strike
happy
outfit
led
by
racketeers.
again,
your
honors,
we
submit
there
is
no
threat
or
force
or
reprisal
in
the
statement
and
that
it
is
fully
protected
by
section
8
(c)
and
by
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution.
now,
what
does
the
record
show
with
regard
to
facts?
it
shows
first
of
all
that
the
union
that
was
organizing
us
was
in
effect
the
same
union
that
had
struck
us
for
13
weeks
in
1952.
in
1952,
our
people
were
represented
by
the
awwpa,
the
american
wire
weavers
protective
association
which
had
merged
with
or
been
absorbed
by
the
teamsters
wire
weavers
division
which
was
the
entity
within
the
teamsters
union
that
sent
the
initial
letter
to
our
employees
and
began
its
attempt
to
organize
them
in
july
of
1965.
so
the
awwpa
which
had
been
swallowed
up
by
the
teamsters
was
the
organizing
entity.
the
authorization
cards
sent
out
to
the
employees
authorized
the
international
union
to
represent
these
people
and
also
authorized
the
international
to
designate
or
charter
any
other
local
to
represent.
the
organizational
attempts
started
with
the
international
and
the
first
recognition
demand
came
from
the
international
on
august
17th
and
it
was
a
request
made
not
only
by
the
international
but
on
behalf
of
the
international
as
shown
by
our
response
to
it.
any
statements
with
respect
to
racketeering
certainly
amply
supported
by
senator
kennedy's
book
“the
enemy
within”
which
we
sent
to
our
employees
and
records
of
some
of
the
investigating
committees
and
the
reference
to
the
teamsters
being
a
strike
happy
outfit
was
supported
in
our
letters
to
our
employees
by
“directly
from
mr.
hoffa
himself”
in
connection
with
an
organizing
campaign
among
telephone
installers
where
he
told
this
people
that
here,
they
should
be
ready
to
do
warfare
with
their
employer
for
six
or
nine
months
or
not
coming
into
the
teamsters
union
at
all.
now,
we
submit
that
certainly
we
have
a
right
to
disseminate
these
facts
to
our
employees
with
respect
to
our
employee
--
with
respect
to
the
teamsters
union.
there's
no
threat
or
force
or
reprising.
we
submit
that
our
statements
were
lawful
under
section
8
(c)
and
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
the
board,
yes,
based
on
its
totality
doctrine,
the
board
did
not
and
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
did
not
take
these
five
points
because
it
did
not
tell
us
what
it
us
that
we
had
said.
the
board
said
merely
that
through
their
expertise,
the
totality
of
our
communications
were
coercive.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
did
follow
this
type
of
analysis
and
set
forth
four
different
points
which
we
submit
do
not
support
the
board's
order
in
any
event
or
its
findings.
however,
the
court
below
merely
deferred
to
the
board's
expertise
and
to
the
test
of
substantial
evidence
and
we
submit
that
in
both
of
these
respects,
the
court
below
urged
that
board
expertise
was
not
in
the
proper
standards.
the
courts
should
have
reviewed
the
record
itself
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
were
any
improper
statement
and
that
substantiality
of
the
evidence
was
not
criterion
particularly
here
when
the
facts
were
undisputed
and
all
that
was
involved
where
the
interpretations
or
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
these
facts.
now,
again
i
point
to
this
court's
decision
in
linn
against
plant
guards
where
this
court
pointed
out
that
a
great
leeway
was
to
be
afforded
to
the
combatants
or
contestants
in
a
pre-election
campaign
for
vigorous
(inaudible)
and
costly
common.
now,
apparently,
in
the
board's
attorney's
do
not
consider
that
points
one,
two,
and
three
add
up
to
an
unlawful
totality
because
they've
gone
on
to
number
five
and
i
assume
that
one,
two,
and
three
would
not
be
sufficient
in
the
board's
view
to
constitute
a
violation
of
the
act.
the
fourth
point
the
board
points
to
is
the
statement
to
the
effect
that
the
another
strike
could
result
in
closing
of
the
plant
as
lindsey
would
shift
work
to
its
mississippi
and
ohio
plants
if
the
sinclair
company
did
not
make
a
profit.
now
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
the
charge
in
this
case,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
the
charge
is
an
8
(a)
(1)
charge.
initially
there
were
charges
of
8
(a)
(1),
(3),
and
(5)
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
the
8
(a)
(3)
was
dismissed
and
was
never
litigated.
it
was
dismissed
administratively
then
the
hearing
procedure
on
the
charge
of
8
(a)
(1)
and
an
8
(a)
(5).
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
and
the
8
(a)
(5)
charge
of
course
is
based
wholly
and
solely
on
the
evidence
again
of
our
words
to
our
employees.
there
is
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
no.
it's
the
other
way
around.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
and
the
board
automatically
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
right.
then
the
same
words
are
used
by
the
board
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
i'm
not
sure
that
i
follow.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
yes,
well
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
right.
the
board's
theory
is
that
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(5)
for
example
or
8
(a)
(3)
subsumes
or
i
should
put
it
the
other
way.
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(1)
is
subsumed
in
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(3)
for
example.
if
there
is
an
unlawful
discharge,
this
violates
not
only
8
(a)
(3)
but
also
8
(a)
(1).
so
in
this
case,
the
board
is
turning
around.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
they
say
that
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(1)
or
of
8
(a)
(5)
i
should
say
is
subsumed
in
the
violation
of
8
(a)
(1),
now
we
don't
have
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
--
to
put
forth
any
more
error.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
this
is
--
this
is
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
well,
the
–
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
at
8
(a)
(3),
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
no.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
oh,
8
(a)
(3)
makes
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
well,
of
course
there
are
contentions
that
nothing
that
we've
said
violated
section
8
(a)
(1)
that
the
board
did
not
appoint.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
we
have
sought
in
vain,
your
honor,
to
try
to
find
out
what
the
board's
view
is
because
the
board's
decision
does
not
tell
us.
all
the
board
did
in
its
decision
is
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
it
--
they
collected
a
series
of
little
excerpts
from
what
we
said
and
enlisted
among
in
their
opinion
then
they
said
all
of
these
foregoing
speeches
and
communications
when
considered
as
a
whole
are
unlawful.
then
the
board
made
one
finding
relating
to
july
5
to
december
9
the
date
of
the
election,
then
made
a
second
finding
that
related
only
for
the
--
to
the
period
from
november
8
to
december
9.
now,
and
the
board
reach
the
same
conclusion
in
both
cases,
the
second
finding
limiting
it
to
from
november
8
to
december
9
was
made
initially
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
findings
upon
which
the
election
could
be
set
aside
and
because
objections
or
conduct
is
not
considered
as
justifying
setting
aside
and
like
somewhat
less
than
occurs
on
or
after
the
date
the
election
petitioners
thought.
so,
that's
the
reason
for
the
november
8
date
but
other
than
the
board's
statement
that
the
totality
of
our
communications
violated
the
act,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
the
basis
of
this
conclusion
is.
the
board
never
pointed
to
any
specific
statement
and
said
on
such
and
such
date
you
made
a
certain
statement
and
this
statement
threatened
or
coerced
the
employees
or
that
you
threatened
reprisals
of
the
facts
are
to
completely
to
the
contrary
which
the
board
has
completely
ignored
it
because
we
repeatedly
told
our
people
that
we
would
not
close
our
plant
and
that
we
would
fulfill
our
duty
to
bargain
with
the
union
if
they
selected
one.
the
entire
thrust
of
our
conversations
with
our
people
was
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
if
this
same
union
that
had
once
represented
our
people
and
had
already
once
before
called
the
strike
over
unreasonable
demands.
if
this
union
came
in
and
did
the
same
thing,
then
there
was
a
possibility
that
there
would
be
adverse
consequences
to
all
concerned
because
the
company
was
not
in
the
position
to
agree
to
any
unreasonable
demands.
the
board
characterizes
our
comments
as
predictions.
well,
there
are
nothing
in
what
we
said
where
we
even
we
went
to
so
far
as
to
predict
that
anything
of
this
nature
would
resolve.
we
never
predicted,
we
discussed
the
possibility.
it
was
a
possibility
that
if
the
union
was
selected
and
if
the
union
made
unreasonable
demands
upon
us
in
the
negotiating
context
and
if
we
were
unable
to
meet
these
demands
and
if
they
called
a
strike,
then
there
was
a
possibility
that
this
plant
might
close.
we
never
predicted
that
any
of
this
would
happen.
we
repeatedly
said
that
we
did
not
intend
to
close
the
present
sinclair
or
repeatedly
indicated
to
the
employees
that
what
was
involved
was
his
life.
it
was
his
job,
it
was
his
family
business
and
in
his
final
speech
to
the
employees,
he
said
that
he
would
do
his
level
best
to
keep
the
sinclair
company
in
business
and
growing.
so
that
we
submit
that
the
boards
findings
based
upon
a
totality
of
--
are
not
supported
by
the
evidence
that
our
statements
that
are
constitutionally
protected
and
are
protected
by
section
(8)
(c),
and
that
there
are
no
threats
of
reprisal
or
force
including
anything
that
we
said.
now,
in
this
regard,
we
point
to
senator
taft's
explanation
in
two-legislative
history
1627
which
we
cited
at
pages
67-68
of
our
brief
where
senator
taft
in
explaining
section
(8)
(c)
said
that
views,
argument
or
opinion
shall
not
be
evidence
of
an
unfair
labor
practice,
unless
they
contain
in
themselves
a
threat
or
coercion
or
promise
of
benefit.
now,
the
board
is
urging
before
this
court
a
subjective
test
with
regards
to
section
(8)
(c)
as
to
what
the
listener
believe
which
amounts
to
reading
section
(8)
(c)
out
of
the
act
entirely.
and
it
would
again
turn
all
speech
questions
in
labor
matters
or
the
board
of
expertise
and
we
submit
that
this
is
what
congress
attempted
to
prevent
when
it
enacted
section
(8)
(c)
in
the
first
place.
and
this
is
what
the
board
has
done
here
in
this
case
attempted
to
substitute
expertise
for
evidence
and
for
findings.
we
submit
that
our
lawful
statements
cannot
be
added
up
to
an
unlawful
totality
through
bar
or
board
expertise
and
if
this
can
be
done
by
the
board,
they
don't
have
to
make
any
findings
and
they
don't
have
to
find
that
a
statement
is
a
threat
and
shown
that
this
is
supported
by
evidence
then
we
submit
that
we
will
have
the
monster
of
expertise
which
this
court
shown
in
the
burlington
case.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
i
think
if
the
statement
was
made,
if
you
join
such
and
such
union,
the
plant
will
be
move
south?
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
well,
i
would
say
that
that
was
a
direct
threat
to
the
employees
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
in
substance
that
is
our
position,
yes
because
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
you
mean
on
the
bargaining
order
aspects
of
the
case?
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
yes.
there
is
really
a
point
in
that
regard.
now,
the
board
in
this
case
having
filed
that
he
committed
an
8
(a)
(1)
violation
as
i
said
earlier
subsumed
an
8
(a)
(5)
violation
in
the
8
(a)
(1)
because
there
was
no
other
evidence
in
this
case
other
than
the
evidence
of
our
words
and
they
used
our
words
then
as
evidence
of
a
number
of
other
things.
they
used
our
words
and
our
finding
on
section
8
(a)
(1)
as
evidence
that
we
did
not
have
a
good
faith
doubt
of
the
union's
majority
status.
also,
that
we
did
not
have
a
good
faith
doubt
of
the
appropriate
unit
but
we
sought
to
gain
time
in
order
to
defeat
the
union
that
we
through
our
communications
that
we
cause
the
union
to
lose
support.
and
finally,
the
final
and
most
important
finding
which
the
board
made
specifically
in
this
case
so
that
would
be
impossible
to
conduct
a
fair
second
election
and
then
of
course
the
board
does
this
through
bootstrapping
technique
having
found
the
8
(a)
(1),
they
automatically
arrived
at
the
8
(a)
(5)
because
the
board
claims
the
right
to
infer
of
all
these
findings
from
the
8
(a)
(1).
we
submit
that
there
is
no
logical
basis
for
this
kind
of
inference.
now,
the
--
i
would
like
to
just
add
a
few
more
comments
because
my
time
is
valuable.
it
is
our
--
as
i
try
to
summarize
on
the
bargaining
order
aspects
of
the
case,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
question
of
good
faith
doubt
is
really
irrelevant
and
that
the
board
said
so
itself
in
this
case.
in
its
order,
the
board
said
that
even
if
we
had
had
a
good
faith
doubt
that
they
would
nevertheless
have
ordered
us
to
bargain
anyway.
so,
that
the
board
itself
says
that
the
question
of
good
faith
doubt
is
irrelevant.
i
think
the
important
aspect
in
this
case
and
in
the
others
of
bargaining
order
is
a
question
of
what
is
the
proper
remedy
for
the
8
(a)
(1)
violation
if
there
is
one
in
this
case
and
we
deny
that
there
is
one
in
this
case
and
we
deny
that
there
is,
or
what
is
the
proper
remedy
in
--
for
the
unfair
labor
practices
that
have
been
found
and
the
court
of
appeals
although
many
of
them
still
using
the
good
faith
doubt
language
have
basically
directed
their
attention
to
this
question.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
yes,
that's
it.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
no,
it's
not
in
that
language.
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
it
is
in
the
order
though,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
yes,
it's
in
the
board's
order
and
discussions.
i
should
say,
not
in
the
order
itself
and
the
discussion.
the
board
says
that
even
if
we
had
had
a
good
faith
doubt
in
this
case,
they
would
have
ordered
us
to
bargain
in
any
event.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
and
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
no.
the
board
really
adopted
the
order
in
decision
of
the
trial
examiner.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
no,
sir.
it's
in
the
trial
examiner's
decision
i
have
referred
with
in
this
brief
as
being
the
board
decision
because
the
board
adopted
it.
but
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
it's
page
198,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
it
starts
about
six
lines
down.
moreover,
i
would
recommend
the
same
bargaining
order
even
if
the
record
had
warned
of
the
conclusion
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
--
and
so
forth.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
i
didn't
get
the
last
words,
your
honor,
would
be
grounds
for?
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
well,
i
say
that
if
an
employer
goes
to
employees
and
says,
“if
you
vote
for
this
union,
i
will
move
the
plants
out”
that
this
could
be
considered
a
threat
under
section
(8)
(c)
of
the
act.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
pardon
me?
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
well,
i
would
say
that
this
would
be
a
threat
under
(8)
(c)
and
could
be
considered
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
well,
first
that
would
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
that
would
--
you'd
have
to
consider
the
effect
of
the
darlington
case
or
the
darlington
decision
of
this
court
as
to
whether
or
not
he
would
be
legally
entitled
might
the
state.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
yes,
i
would
say
that
if
an
employer
made
a
flat
statement
to
employees
that
if
you
vote
for
the
union
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
if
the
union
wins,
this
--
i
hope
this
plant
will
be
moved
south.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
and
this
could
be
considered
a
new
trial.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
excuse
me.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
would
like
to
get
immediately
into
the
reason
why
we
are
here.
in
december
of
1965,
the
teamsters
union
lost
an
nlrb
election
which
was
held
among
employees
classified
as
journeymen
wire
weavers
at
our
plant
on
holyoke,
massachusetts.
they
voted
seven
against
the
union
and
six
for
the
union.
now,
even
though
the
union
lost
the
election,
the
labor
board
ordered
us
to
bargain
with
it
and
why
did
the
labor
board
do
this?
they
did
it
because
of
our
words,
because
of
what
we
said
to
our
employees
prior
to
a
conduct
of
this
election.
unlike
the
other
cases
that
have
been
heard
this
afternoon,
there
were
no
discharges,
there
was
no
interrogation,
there
was
no
surveillance,
and
there
were
no
promises
of
benefit
by
the
employer
in
this
case.
now,
during
the
organizing
campaign,
president
david
sinclair
made
two
speeches
to
the
employees
and
he
wrote
about
eight
letters
for
handbills.
now,
in
its
decision,
the
board
could
not
find
a
single
statement.
they
couldn't
find
a
single
sentence
or
a
single
communication
which
they
could
characterize
as
being
unlawful.
so,
instead,
what
the
board
said
in
fact
was
that
even
though
each
of
the
employer's
statements
was
lawful
by
itself
considered
separately,
we,
the
board
in
our
expertise
seating
here
in
washington
will
decide
that
the
totality
of
all
these
lawful
statements
however
are
unlawful
and
are
coercive,
and
that
is
why
we
are
here.
it
is
our
position
that
our
communications
to
our
employees
were
lawful
and
protected
not
only
by
section
8
(c)
of
the
taft-hartley
act
but
also
by
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution.
now,
we
would
like
to
meet
the
issues
head-on
and
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
21
of
the
board's
brief.
the
board's
attorneys
call
attention
on
page
21
of
their
brief
to
five
points
that
allegedly
were
made
by
president
david
sinclair
in
petitioner's
communications.
i'm
using
the
term
board's
attorneys
advisedly
because
the
board
nowhere
indicated
that
it
relied
upon
these
five
points
or
upon
any
other
points.
the
only
finding
that
we
have
from
the
board
is
that
by
petitioner's
series
of
communications
that
when
they
were
considered
as
a
whole
that
these
were
coercive
but
the
board
at
no
time
ever
indicated
as
to
what
it
was
specifically
that
we
had
said
at
narrative
proscription.
that's
why
i
point
to
page
21
of
the
board's
brief
because
the
board's
attorneys
point
to
five
points
which
they
say
we
made
and
these
five
points
i
gather
which
made
--
allegedly
made
our
communications
coercive
in
the
board's
view.
now,
of
course
the
board's
attorneys
merely
expanded
upon
an
approach
taken
by
the
court
below
which
did
much
the
same
thing
relying
upon
four
points.
again,
which
there
are
no
evidence
were
relied
on
by
the
board.
now,
we
submit
that
each
of
the
five
statements
or
points
that
are
referred
to
in
the
board's
brief
were
lawful
and
protected
by
section
8
(c)
and
by
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution.
point
number
one,
for
example
is
that
the
1952
strike
left
the
company
in
a
state
of
continuing
financial
difficulty.
now,
of
course
the
facts
in
our
case
are
that
we
did
have
a
union
for
journeymen
and
at
the
time
apprentice
wire
weavers
up
until
1952
and
there
was
a
13-week
strike.
and
in
our
communications,
we
told
the
employees
that
the
1952
strike
of
13
weeks
duration
had
left
the
company
in
a
continuing
state
of
financial
difficulty
and
we
submit
that
this
statement
is
perfectly
lawful
and
proper
under
section
8
(c)
of
the
act
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
can
it
be
acclaimed
to
contain
a
threat
or
force
or
reprisal
on
our
part,
certainly
is
not
a
promise
of
benefit.
further,
the
statement
is
amply
supported
by
the
record
and
i
point
out
that
this
court
has
held
that
no
test
of
truth
can
be
administered
either
by
judges
or
juries
or
by
administrative
agencies
when
questions
of
free
speech
were
involved
but
the
record
does
support
this
statement
and
it
shows
that
the
financial
difficulties
over
the
years
became
so
severe
that
in
1964
president
david
sinclair
was
forced
to
sell
his
family-owned
company.
now,
we
assume
that
even
the
board
will
agree
with
us
that
statement
number
one
which
the
board
is
relying
on
is
a
statement
lawful
and
protected
under
8
(c)
and
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
it's
on
page
21,
your
honor,
of
the
board.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
now,
the
second
statement
that
the
board
relies
upon
is
a
statement
that
a
petitioner
stated
that
a
union
would
make
unreasonable
demands
which
the
company
could
not
meet
and
then
its
only
recourse
would
be
a
strike.
well,
i'm
not
going
to
quibble
over
the
wording.
we
made
statements
substantially
to
of
that
nature
in
the
course
of
the
pre-election
campaign.
but
we
submit
that
anyone
knows
that
this
statement,
that
is
that
if
the
company
cannot
meet
unreasonable
demands
that
the
union's
only
recourse
is
the
strike,
is
a
true
statement.
it
doesn't
take
board
expertise
to
determine
this.
now,
we
submit
that
a
statement
of
this
nature
also
is
lawful
and
protected
under
section
8
(c)
under
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution.
to
the
extent
that
there
may
be
involved
a
charge
that
a
union
or
the
union
or
the
teamsters
union
would
make
unreasonable
demands,
we
submit
that
this
is
lawful
and
protected.
it's
a
statement
relevant
to
the
issues
and
in
linn
against
plant
guards.
this
court
recognized
that
a
wide
scope
was
to
be
given
in
a
pre-election
campaign
of
charges
and
counter-charges.
now,
and
it
doesn't
take
board
expertise
to
know
that
unions
do
make
unreasonable
demands.
everyone
knows
this.
this
is
the
name
of
the
game.
this
is
the
basis
upon
which
negotiations
start
in
any
labor
management
context
and
the
people
in
the
plant
know
this,
and
particularly
these
people
and
this
plant
knew
it
because
they'd
all
been
union
members
back
in
--
i
should
amend
my
statement
of
all,
a
majority
of
them
have
been
members
of
the
union
back
in
1952
and
anyone
who
negotiates
labor
contracts
as
i
have
know
this
also.
now,
in
addition,
here,
there
is
a
background
of
a
strike
over
unreasonable
demands
in
1952.
the
majority
of
the
employees
involved
in
this
election
campaign
went
through
the
1952
strike.
they
knew
what
the
unreasonable
demands
were
back
in
1952
that
led
to
that
strike.
now,
we
submit
that
neither
section
8
(c)
nor
the
constitution
permits
the
board
to
shield
employees
from
something
they
already
know.
basically,
this
is
the
substance
of
statement
number
2
that
is
relied
upon
by
the
board.
now,
what
else
did
we
do
according
to
the
board's
attorneys?
three,
according
to
the
board's
attorneys,
we
pointed
out
to
the
employees
that
such
a
recourse
that
is
unreasonable
demands
was
particularly
to
be
expected
from
the
teamsters
union
which
was
a
strike
happy
outfit
led
by
racketeers.
again,
your
honors,
we
submit
there
is
no
threat
or
force
or
reprisal
in
the
statement
and
that
it
is
fully
protected
by
section
8
(c)
and
by
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution.
now,
what
does
the
record
show
with
regard
to
facts?
it
shows
first
of
all
that
the
union
that
was
organizing
us
was
in
effect
the
same
union
that
had
struck
us
for
13
weeks
in
1952.
in
1952,
our
people
were
represented
by
the
awwpa,
the
american
wire
weavers
protective
association
which
had
merged
with
or
been
absorbed
by
the
teamsters
wire
weavers
division
which
was
the
entity
within
the
teamsters
union
that
sent
the
initial
letter
to
our
employees
and
began
its
attempt
to
organize
them
in
july
of
1965.
so
the
awwpa
which
had
been
swallowed
up
by
the
teamsters
was
the
organizing
entity.
the
authorization
cards
sent
out
to
the
employees
authorized
the
international
union
to
represent
these
people
and
also
authorized
the
international
to
designate
or
charter
any
other
local
to
represent.
the
organizational
attempts
started
with
the
international
and
the
first
recognition
demand
came
from
the
international
on
august
17th
and
it
was
a
request
made
not
only
by
the
international
but
on
behalf
of
the
international
as
shown
by
our
response
to
it.
any
statements
with
respect
to
racketeering
certainly
amply
supported
by
senator
kennedy's
book
“the
enemy
within”
which
we
sent
to
our
employees
and
records
of
some
of
the
investigating
committees
and
the
reference
to
the
teamsters
being
a
strike
happy
outfit
was
supported
in
our
letters
to
our
employees
by
“directly
from
mr.
hoffa
himself”
in
connection
with
an
organizing
campaign
among
telephone
installers
where
he
told
this
people
that
here,
they
should
be
ready
to
do
warfare
with
their
employer
for
six
or
nine
months
or
not
coming
into
the
teamsters
union
at
all.
now,
we
submit
that
certainly
we
have
a
right
to
disseminate
these
facts
to
our
employees
with
respect
to
our
employee
--
with
respect
to
the
teamsters
union.
there's
no
threat
or
force
or
reprising.
we
submit
that
our
statements
were
lawful
under
section
8
(c)
and
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
the
board,
yes,
based
on
its
totality
doctrine,
the
board
did
not
and
as
i
pointed
out
earlier
did
not
take
these
five
points
because
it
did
not
tell
us
what
it
us
that
we
had
said.
the
board
said
merely
that
through
their
expertise,
the
totality
of
our
communications
were
coercive.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
did
follow
this
type
of
analysis
and
set
forth
four
different
points
which
we
submit
do
not
support
the
board's
order
in
any
event
or
its
findings.
however,
the
court
below
merely
deferred
to
the
board's
expertise
and
to
the
test
of
substantial
evidence
and
we
submit
that
in
both
of
these
respects,
the
court
below
urged
that
board
expertise
was
not
in
the
proper
standards.
the
courts
should
have
reviewed
the
record
itself
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
were
any
improper
statement
and
that
substantiality
of
the
evidence
was
not
criterion
particularly
here
when
the
facts
were
undisputed
and
all
that
was
involved
where
the
interpretations
or
conclusions
to
be
drawn
from
these
facts.
now,
again
i
point
to
this
court's
decision
in
linn
against
plant
guards
where
this
court
pointed
out
that
a
great
leeway
was
to
be
afforded
to
the
combatants
or
contestants
in
a
pre-election
campaign
for
vigorous
(inaudible)
and
costly
common.
now,
apparently,
in
the
board's
attorney's
do
not
consider
that
points
one,
two,
and
three
add
up
to
an
unlawful
totality
because
they've
gone
on
to
number
five
and
i
assume
that
one,
two,
and
three
would
not
be
sufficient
in
the
board's
view
to
constitute
a
violation
of
the
act.
the
fourth
point
the
board
points
to
is
the
statement
to
the
effect
that
the
another
strike
could
result
in
closing
of
the
plant
as
lindsey
would
shift
work
to
its
mississippi
and
ohio
plants
if
the
sinclair
company
did
not
make
a
profit.
now
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
the
charge
in
this
case,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
the
charge
is
an
8
(a)
(1)
charge.
initially
there
were
charges
of
8
(a)
(1),
(3),
and
(5)
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
the
8
(a)
(3)
was
dismissed
and
was
never
litigated.
it
was
dismissed
administratively
then
the
hearing
procedure
on
the
charge
of
8
(a)
(1)
and
an
8
(a)
(5).
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
and
the
8
(a)
(5)
charge
of
course
is
based
wholly
and
solely
on
the
evidence
again
of
our
words
to
our
employees.
there
is
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
no.
it's
the
other
way
around.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
and
the
board
automatically
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
right.
then
the
same
words
are
used
by
the
board
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
i'm
not
sure
that
i
follow.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
yes,
well
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
right.
the
board's
theory
is
that
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(5)
for
example
or
8
(a)
(3)
subsumes
or
i
should
put
it
the
other
way.
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(1)
is
subsumed
in
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(3)
for
example.
if
there
is
an
unlawful
discharge,
this
violates
not
only
8
(a)
(3)
but
also
8
(a)
(1).
so
in
this
case,
the
board
is
turning
around.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
they
say
that
a
violation
of
8
(a)
(1)
or
of
8
(a)
(5)
i
should
say
is
subsumed
in
the
violation
of
8
(a)
(1),
now
we
don't
have
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
--
to
put
forth
any
more
error.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
this
is
--
this
is
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
well,
the
–
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
at
8
(a)
(3),
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
no.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
oh,
8
(a)
(3)
makes
an
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
well,
of
course
there
are
contentions
that
nothing
that
we've
said
violated
section
8
(a)
(1)
that
the
board
did
not
appoint.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
we
have
sought
in
vain,
your
honor,
to
try
to
find
out
what
the
board's
view
is
because
the
board's
decision
does
not
tell
us.
all
the
board
did
in
its
decision
is
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
it
--
they
collected
a
series
of
little
excerpts
from
what
we
said
and
enlisted
among
in
their
opinion
then
they
said
all
of
these
foregoing
speeches
and
communications
when
considered
as
a
whole
are
unlawful.
then
the
board
made
one
finding
relating
to
july
5
to
december
9
the
date
of
the
election,
then
made
a
second
finding
that
related
only
for
the
--
to
the
period
from
november
8
to
december
9.
now,
and
the
board
reach
the
same
conclusion
in
both
cases,
the
second
finding
limiting
it
to
from
november
8
to
december
9
was
made
initially
for
the
purpose
of
establishing
findings
upon
which
the
election
could
be
set
aside
and
because
objections
or
conduct
is
not
considered
as
justifying
setting
aside
and
like
somewhat
less
than
occurs
on
or
after
the
date
the
election
petitioners
thought.
so,
that's
the
reason
for
the
november
8
date
but
other
than
the
board's
statement
that
the
totality
of
our
communications
violated
the
act,
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
the
basis
of
this
conclusion
is.
the
board
never
pointed
to
any
specific
statement
and
said
on
such
and
such
date
you
made
a
certain
statement
and
this
statement
threatened
or
coerced
the
employees
or
that
you
threatened
reprisals
of
the
facts
are
to
completely
to
the
contrary
which
the
board
has
completely
ignored
it
because
we
repeatedly
told
our
people
that
we
would
not
close
our
plant
and
that
we
would
fulfill
our
duty
to
bargain
with
the
union
if
they
selected
one.
the
entire
thrust
of
our
conversations
with
our
people
was
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
if
this
same
union
that
had
once
represented
our
people
and
had
already
once
before
called
the
strike
over
unreasonable
demands.
if
this
union
came
in
and
did
the
same
thing,
then
there
was
a
possibility
that
there
would
be
adverse
consequences
to
all
concerned
because
the
company
was
not
in
the
position
to
agree
to
any
unreasonable
demands.
the
board
characterizes
our
comments
as
predictions.
well,
there
are
nothing
in
what
we
said
where
we
even
we
went
to
so
far
as
to
predict
that
anything
of
this
nature
would
resolve.
we
never
predicted,
we
discussed
the
possibility.
it
was
a
possibility
that
if
the
union
was
selected
and
if
the
union
made
unreasonable
demands
upon
us
in
the
negotiating
context
and
if
we
were
unable
to
meet
these
demands
and
if
they
called
a
strike,
then
there
was
a
possibility
that
this
plant
might
close.
we
never
predicted
that
any
of
this
would
happen.
we
repeatedly
said
that
we
did
not
intend
to
close
the
present
sinclair
or
repeatedly
indicated
to
the
employees
that
what
was
involved
was
his
life.
it
was
his
job,
it
was
his
family
business
and
in
his
final
speech
to
the
employees,
he
said
that
he
would
do
his
level
best
to
keep
the
sinclair
company
in
business
and
growing.
so
that
we
submit
that
the
boards
findings
based
upon
a
totality
of
--
are
not
supported
by
the
evidence
that
our
statements
that
are
constitutionally
protected
and
are
protected
by
section
(8)
(c),
and
that
there
are
no
threats
of
reprisal
or
force
including
anything
that
we
said.
now,
in
this
regard,
we
point
to
senator
taft's
explanation
in
two-legislative
history
1627
which
we
cited
at
pages
67-68
of
our
brief
where
senator
taft
in
explaining
section
(8)
(c)
said
that
views,
argument
or
opinion
shall
not
be
evidence
of
an
unfair
labor
practice,
unless
they
contain
in
themselves
a
threat
or
coercion
or
promise
of
benefit.
now,
the
board
is
urging
before
this
court
a
subjective
test
with
regards
to
section
(8)
(c)
as
to
what
the
listener
believe
which
amounts
to
reading
section
(8)
(c)
out
of
the
act
entirely.
and
it
would
again
turn
all
speech
questions
in
labor
matters
or
the
board
of
expertise
and
we
submit
that
this
is
what
congress
attempted
to
prevent
when
it
enacted
section
(8)
(c)
in
the
first
place.
and
this
is
what
the
board
has
done
here
in
this
case
attempted
to
substitute
expertise
for
evidence
and
for
findings.
we
submit
that
our
lawful
statements
cannot
be
added
up
to
an
unlawful
totality
through
bar
or
board
expertise
and
if
this
can
be
done
by
the
board,
they
don't
have
to
make
any
findings
and
they
don't
have
to
find
that
a
statement
is
a
threat
and
shown
that
this
is
supported
by
evidence
then
we
submit
that
we
will
have
the
monster
of
expertise
which
this
court
shown
in
the
burlington
case.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
i
think
if
the
statement
was
made,
if
you
join
such
and
such
union,
the
plant
will
be
move
south?
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
well,
i
would
say
that
that
was
a
direct
threat
to
the
employees
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
your
honor
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
in
substance
that
is
our
position,
yes
because
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
you
mean
on
the
bargaining
order
aspects
of
the
case?
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
yes.
there
is
really
a
point
in
that
regard.
now,
the
board
in
this
case
having
filed
that
he
committed
an
8
(a)
(1)
violation
as
i
said
earlier
subsumed
an
8
(a)
(5)
violation
in
the
8
(a)
(1)
because
there
was
no
other
evidence
in
this
case
other
than
the
evidence
of
our
words
and
they
used
our
words
then
as
evidence
of
a
number
of
other
things.
they
used
our
words
and
our
finding
on
section
8
(a)
(1)
as
evidence
that
we
did
not
have
a
good
faith
doubt
of
the
union's
majority
status.
also,
that
we
did
not
have
a
good
faith
doubt
of
the
appropriate
unit
but
we
sought
to
gain
time
in
order
to
defeat
the
union
that
we
through
our
communications
that
we
cause
the
union
to
lose
support.
and
finally,
the
final
and
most
important
finding
which
the
board
made
specifically
in
this
case
so
that
would
be
impossible
to
conduct
a
fair
second
election
and
then
of
course
the
board
does
this
through
bootstrapping
technique
having
found
the
8
(a)
(1),
they
automatically
arrived
at
the
8
(a)
(5)
because
the
board
claims
the
right
to
infer
of
all
these
findings
from
the
8
(a)
(1).
we
submit
that
there
is
no
logical
basis
for
this
kind
of
inference.
now,
the
--
i
would
like
to
just
add
a
few
more
comments
because
my
time
is
valuable.
it
is
our
--
as
i
try
to
summarize
on
the
bargaining
order
aspects
of
the
case,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
question
of
good
faith
doubt
is
really
irrelevant
and
that
the
board
said
so
itself
in
this
case.
in
its
order,
the
board
said
that
even
if
we
had
had
a
good
faith
doubt
that
they
would
nevertheless
have
ordered
us
to
bargain
anyway.
so,
that
the
board
itself
says
that
the
question
of
good
faith
doubt
is
irrelevant.
i
think
the
important
aspect
in
this
case
and
in
the
others
of
bargaining
order
is
a
question
of
what
is
the
proper
remedy
for
the
8
(a)
(1)
violation
if
there
is
one
in
this
case
and
we
deny
that
there
is
one
in
this
case
and
we
deny
that
there
is,
or
what
is
the
proper
remedy
in
--
for
the
unfair
labor
practices
that
have
been
found
and
the
court
of
appeals
although
many
of
them
still
using
the
good
faith
doubt
language
have
basically
directed
their
attention
to
this
question.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
yes,
that's
it.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
no,
it's
not
in
that
language.
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
it
is
in
the
order
though,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
yes,
it's
in
the
board's
order
and
discussions.
i
should
say,
not
in
the
order
itself
and
the
discussion.
the
board
says
that
even
if
we
had
had
a
good
faith
doubt
in
this
case,
they
would
have
ordered
us
to
bargain
in
any
event.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
and
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
no.
the
board
really
adopted
the
order
in
decision
of
the
trial
examiner.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
no,
sir.
it's
in
the
trial
examiner's
decision
i
have
referred
with
in
this
brief
as
being
the
board
decision
because
the
board
adopted
it.
but
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
it's
page
198,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
yes.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
it
starts
about
six
lines
down.
moreover,
i
would
recommend
the
same
bargaining
order
even
if
the
record
had
warned
of
the
conclusion
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
--
and
so
forth.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
i
didn't
get
the
last
words,
your
honor,
would
be
grounds
for?
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
well,
i
say
that
if
an
employer
goes
to
employees
and
says,
“if
you
vote
for
this
union,
i
will
move
the
plants
out”
that
this
could
be
considered
a
threat
under
section
(8)
(c)
of
the
act.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
pardon
me?
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
well,
i
would
say
that
this
would
be
a
threat
under
(8)
(c)
and
could
be
considered
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
well,
first
that
would
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
that
would
--
you'd
have
to
consider
the
effect
of
the
darlington
case
or
the
darlington
decision
of
this
court
as
to
whether
or
not
he
would
be
legally
entitled
might
the
state.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
yes,
i
would
say
that
if
an
employer
made
a
flat
statement
to
employees
that
if
you
vote
for
the
union
--
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
if
the
union
wins,
this
--
i
hope
this
plant
will
be
moved
south.
mr.
edward
j.
simerka
and
this
could
be
considered
a
new
trial.
