justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
manoli,
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
mr.
manoli,
this
so
i
could
be
sure
that
this
into
the
bench,
i
heard
you
correctly.
justice
abe
fortas
the
cards
are
obtained
by
the
union.
justice
abe
fortas
the
employer
says,
i
won't
recognize
these
cards,
and
he
petitions
for
an
election.
no
acts
of
--
no
unfair
labor
practices
intervene.
now,
what
happens
between
the
time
that
the
union
submit
its
cards
and
the
time
the
election
is
held.
does
the
employer
have
to
bargain
with
the
union
then
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
does
he
not?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
saying,
he
does
not
have
to
bargain.
justice
abe
fortas
i
didn't
get
that
either.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
said
that.
i
said
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
but
i
didn't
understand
that
from
your
brief
either?
justice
abe
fortas
what
was
the
board's
practice
at
that
time
--
at
the
time
that
congress
rejected
that?
what
was
the
board's
practice
with
respect
to
cards?
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
but
there's
been
some
shift
in
the
certainties
and
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
new
onsets
and
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
grace
notes
of
all
these?
justice
abe
fortas
what
you're
saying
is
--
are
you
telling
me
then
that
in
1947
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
in
1959
when
congress,
according
to
you,
rejected
in
fact
on
the
use
of
cards,
the
board's
practice
was
at
those
times
was
to
accept
the
cards,
require
that
the
employer
bargain
on
the
basis
of
cards
unless
there
was
an
affirmative
showing
of
bad
faith?
justice
abe
fortas
unless
he
had
a
good
faith
doubt
based
on
objective
consideration
--
i
withdraw
bad
faith.
justice
abe
fortas
but
mr.
gore
let's
see,
the
difference
between
your
position
and
that
of
mr.
manoli.
is
that
mr.
manoli
say
--
you
say
that
after
the
union
presents
the
authorization
cards
to
the
employer.
the
employer
is
under
a
duty
to
bargain
with
the
union
unless
and
until
the
employer
files
a
claim
for
hearing.
justice
abe
fortas
now
wait
a
minute,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
manoli
says
that
when
the
union
presents
the
authorization
cards
to
the
employer,
if
the
employer
says,
i
don't
believe
in
cards
and
i
refuse
to
accept
these
cards.
and
does
not
engage
in
unfair
labor
practice
then
the
employer
is
not,
is
not
under
an
obligation
to
bargain
with
the
union
--
justice
abe
fortas
then
there
has
to
be
an
election
presumably
on
the
petition
of
the
union.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
have
i
stated
the
difference
between
the
two
of
it
correctly?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
arguing
whether
it's
small
or
not.
is
that
the
difference?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
taking
the
position
that
what
mr.
manoli
told
us
is
not
reflected
in
the
statute
or
in
any
board
decisions.
justice
abe
fortas
that
there
are
no
decisions
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
sets
forth
with
what
mr.
manoli
has
told
us,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
gore
--
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
gore
isn't
that
possible
to
dispose
of
these
two
cases
without
reaching
most
of
the
questions
you've
been
discussing.
justice
abe
fortas
that
is
to
say,
as
i
understand
it
that
these
in
both
of
these
cases,
the
board
has
found
affirmative
acts
which
the
board
says
constitute
unfair
labor
practices.
now,
it
is
conceivable
i
suppose
to
decide
these
cases
on
the
basis
that
where
the
employer
engages
in
affirmative
positive
acts
of
unfair
labor
practices.
then,
the
employer
is
not
justified
in
refusing
to
proceed
to
bargain
on
the
basis
of
the
authorization
cards?
justice
abe
fortas
or
was
that
aspect
of
the
case
that
i
got
out
of
the
briefs
and
then
we
heard
a
lot
of
things
that
started
of
this
course.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
jenkins,
did
the
union
in
these
other
cases
where
you
did
file
a
petition
for
an
election.
did
they
--
board
give
any
reason
as
to
why
that
was
not
granted?
justice
abe
fortas
that
sounds
to
me
as
if
that's
very
likely
what
they
said
to
you.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
what
i
like
to
know
is
what
they
say,
give
you
any
reason
and
if
so
what
was
that
reason?
and
then
you
may
go
ahead
of
course
if
you
like
with
your
gloss.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
--
may
i
be
clear
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
on
one
thing.
there
was
a
finding
of
unfair
labor
practice
here
by
the
board,
was
it
there?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
however
that
may
be
i
take
it
that
your
statement
a
few
moments
ago
indicates
nothing
more
than
that
this
particular
types
of
unfair
labor
practices
did
not
occur.
nobody
was
actually
discharged
but
the
board
did
find
that
there
were
other
types
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
of
unfair
labor
practices.
justice
abe
fortas
let
me
see
if
i
understand
the
issue
that
you're
tendering.
number
one,
i
suppose
your
arguing
that
the
compelling
an
employer
to
bargain
with
the
union
on
the
basis
of
authorization
cards
is
not
justified
by
the
statute
in
any
of
that.
are
you
arguing
that?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
you're
not
agreeing
with
me.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what's
your
position
is?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
forgive
me
for
taking
more
of
your
time
but
i
must
endeavor
and
get
a
little
sharper
understanding
of
your
position.
do
i
now
understand
you
to
say
that
there
are
some
limited
circumstances
in
which
in
your
belief
the
board
may
properly
require
bargaining
with
the
union
solely
on
the
basis
of
authorization
card?
justice
abe
fortas
alright
now,
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
for
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
for
example?
justice
abe
fortas
what
citation?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
do
you
agree
with
that
proposition
or
are
you
challenging
it
before
this
court?
that
is
to
say,
that
there
are
--
there
are
circumstances
in
which
the
unfair
labor
practices
are
of
such
a
character
and
are
so
pervasive
as
to
justify
the
board
in
requiring
the
employer
to
recognize
the
union
and
to
bargain
with
it.
even
though
there's
no
election
and
even
though
let
us
say
the
basic
evidence
of
union
representation
is
the
authorization
cards.
do
you
agree
with
that
or
disagree
with
it?
justice
abe
fortas
even
where
there
is
gross
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
unfair
labor
practices
are
so
gross
and
so
pervasive
as
in
the
judgment
of
the
board
and
the
court
to
make
the
holding
of
a
fair
election
impossible?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
what
you
are
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
i'm
not
trying
to
make
--
i'm
not
trying
to
complicate
this
thing.
i'm
trying
to
clarify
it.
now,
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
that
what
should
your
position
really
comes
down
to
urging
this
court
to
adopt
a
standard
based
upon
a
differentiation,
a
qualitative
differentiation
as
to
the
type
and
effect
of
unfair
labor
practices?
that
is
to
say,
there
are
some
kinds
of
unfair
labor
practices
which
will
make
it
alright
in
your
submission
to
rely
on
the
cards.
there
are
other
types
of
labor
practices
such
as
the
ones
involved
in
your
case
that
you
suggest
do
not
provide
a
basis
or
justifying
the
use
of
the
authorization
cards.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
that
where
you
come
out
on
this
may
dependent
part
on
which
proposition
you
stock
with.
in
one
end
it's
possible
to
look
at
this
problem
on
the
assumption
that
the
cards
are
valid
and
that
they
are
operated
effective
to
require
the
employer
to
recognize
a
union
unless
the
employer
in
good
faith
doubts
that
they
are
authentic.
now,
that
seems
to
be
the
position
of
the
board.
in
other
words,
as
they
start
with
proposition
of
the
cards,
authorization
cards
are
valid
and
effective
unless
there's
some
reason
to
challenge
it.
justice
abe
fortas
the
other
way
to
look
at
it
is
let
me
express
you
on
the
other
side,
is
that
the
cards
--
you
start
propositions
--
cards
are
not
effective
and
that
it's
only
if
the
employer
does
something
that
makes
an
election.
the
holding
of
a
fair
election
--
holding
of
a
fair
election
clearly
impossible
that
the
employer,
only
if
the
employer
does
something
to
make
the
election
impossible.
will
the
cards
then
be
given
some
vitality
and
some
life?
but
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
board's
position
as
expressed
by
mr.
manoli
here
is
that
the
cards
are
effective
to
require
the
--
there
acceptance
and
recognition
by
the
employer
unless
he
in
good
faith
doubts
that
he
has
some
basis
for
doubting
in
good
faith
their
validity.
and
it
is
not
just
the
effect
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
on
the
possibility
of
holding
a
fair
election.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
what
makes
this
particular
board.
justice
abe
fortas
because
the
board
disagrees
with
you.
justice
abe
fortas
are
both
the
board
and
the
court
below
disagreed
with
you?
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
you
had
said
that
the
employees,
if
you
join
this
top
progressive
union
and
we're
going
to
move
the
plant
south.
that
would
have
been
--
what
--
would
that
be
coercion
within
the
condemnation
of
the
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
one
possibility
here
is
that
the
board
whether
or
not,
whatever
you
may
call
it,
expertise
or
whatnot,
the
board
may
have
considered
that
the
statements
are
in
context
demanded
to
that
kind
of
a
statement,
is
that
possible
extent
do
you
think?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
is
to
go
through
beyond
this
language
that
was
used
and
say
that
the
board
was
wrong
in
putting
a
sinister
interpretation
on
what
was
nonsense
to
language.
justice
abe
fortas
you
have
another
point
about
the
authorization
occurrence,
don't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
wallace,
are
you
going
to
talk
about
the
authorization
cards
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
manoli,
--
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
mr.
manoli,
this
so
i
could
be
sure
that
this
into
the
bench,
i
heard
you
correctly.
justice
abe
fortas
the
cards
are
obtained
by
the
union.
justice
abe
fortas
the
employer
says,
i
won't
recognize
these
cards,
and
he
petitions
for
an
election.
no
acts
of
--
no
unfair
labor
practices
intervene.
now,
what
happens
between
the
time
that
the
union
submit
its
cards
and
the
time
the
election
is
held.
does
the
employer
have
to
bargain
with
the
union
then
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
or
does
he
not?
justice
abe
fortas
and
you're
saying,
he
does
not
have
to
bargain.
justice
abe
fortas
i
didn't

on
the
basis
of
authorization
cards
is
not
justified
by
the
statute
in
any
of
that.
are
you
arguing
that?
justice
abe
fortas
no,
you're
not
agreeing
with
me.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what's
your
position
is?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
forgive
me
for
taking
more
of
your
time
but
i
must
endeavor
and
get
a
little
sharper
understanding
of
your
position.
do
i
now
understand
you
to
say
that
there
are
some
limited
circumstances
in
which
in
your
belief
the
board
may
properly
require
bargaining
with
the
union
solely
on
the
basis
of
authorization
card?
justice
abe
fortas
alright
now,
--
justice
abe
fortas
what
is
your
position?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
for
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
for
example?
justice
abe
fortas
what
citation?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
do
you
agree
with
that
proposition
or
are
you
challenging
it
before
this
court?
that
is
to
say,
that
there
are
--
there
are
circumstances
in
which
the
unfair
labor
practices
are
of
such
a
character
and
are
so
pervasive
as
to
justify
the
board
in
requiring
the
employer
to
recognize
the
union
and
to
bargain
with
it.
even
though
there's
no
election
and
even
though
let
us
say
the
basic
evidence
of
union
representation
is
the
authorization
cards.
do
you
agree
with
that
or
disagree
with
it?
justice
abe
fortas
even
where
there
is
gross
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
the
unfair
labor
practices
are
so
gross
and
so
pervasive
as
in
the
judgment
of
the
board
and
the
court
to
make
the
holding
of
a
fair
election
impossible?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
what
you
are
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
understand
that.
i'm
not
trying
to
make
--
i'm
not
trying
to
complicate
this
thing.
i'm
trying
to
clarify
it.
now,
what
i'm
suggesting
to
you
is
that
what
should
your
position
really
comes
down
to
urging
this
court
to
adopt
a
standard
based
upon
a
differentiation,
a
qualitative
differentiation
as
to
the
type
and
effect
of
unfair
labor
practices?
that
is
to
say,
there
are
some
kinds
of
unfair
labor
practices
which
will
make
it
alright
in
your
submission
to
rely
on
the
cards.
there
are
other
types
of
labor
practices
such
as
the
ones
involved
in
your
case
that
you
suggest
do
not
provide
a
basis
or
justifying
the
use
of
the
authorization
cards.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
suppose
that
where
you
come
out
on
this
may
dependent
part
on
which
proposition
you
stock
with.
in
one
end
it's
possible
to
look
at
this
problem
on
the
assumption
that
the
cards
are
valid
and
that
they
are
operated
effective
to
require
the
employer
to
recognize
a
union
unless
the
employer
in
good
faith
doubts
that
they
are
authentic.
now,
that
seems
to
be
the
position
of
the
board.
in
other
words,
as
they
start
with
proposition
of
the
cards,
authorization
cards
are
valid
and
effective
unless
there's
some
reason
to
challenge
it.
justice
abe
fortas
the
other
way
to
look
at
it
is
let
me
express
you
on
the
other
side,
is
that
the
cards
--
you
start
propositions
--
cards
are
not
effective
and
that
it's
only
if
the
employer
does
something
that
makes
an
election.
the
holding
of
a
fair
election
--
holding
of
a
fair
election
clearly
impossible
that
the
employer,
only
if
the
employer
does
something
to
make
the
election
impossible.
will
the
cards
then
be
given
some
vitality
and
some
life?
but
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
board's
position
as
expressed
by
mr.
manoli
here
is
that
the
cards
are
effective
to
require
the
--
there
acceptance
and
recognition
by
the
employer
unless
he
in
good
faith
doubts
that
he
has
some
basis
for
doubting
in
good
faith
their
validity.
and
it
is
not
just
the
effect
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
on
the
possibility
of
holding
a
fair
election.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
what
makes
this
particular
board.
justice
abe
fortas
because
the
board
disagrees
with
you.
justice
abe
fortas
are
both
the
board
and
the
court
below
disagreed
with
you?
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
you
had
said
that
the
employees,
if
you
join
this
top
progressive
union
and
we're
going
to
move
the
plant
south.
that
would
have
been
--
what
--
would
that
be
coercion
within
the
condemnation
of
the
statute?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
right.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
one
possibility
here
is
that
the
board
whether
or
not,
whatever
you
may
call
it,
expertise
or
whatnot,
the
board
may
have
considered
that
the
statements
are
in
context
demanded
to
that
kind
of
a
statement,
is
that
possible
extent
do
you
think?
justice
abe
fortas
and
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
is
to
go
through
beyond
this
language
that
was
used
and
say
that
the
board
was
wrong
in
putting
a
sinister
interpretation
on
what
was
nonsense
to
language.
justice
abe
fortas
you
have
another
point
about
the
authorization
occurrence,
don't
you?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
wallace,
are
you
going
to
talk
about
the
authorization
cards
here?
