justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
question
about
the
--
about
whether
a
subsequent
election
changes
any
of
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
we
have
to
decide
that
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
we
have
to
decide
that
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
these
cases
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
do
that
to
decide
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
manoli,
what
is
the
board's
view
of
what
the
employer
must,
and
like
they
say,
what
is
there
position
that
he
must
take
before
the
board
that
will
recognize
that
he
may
insist
on
an
election
rather
than
to
a
court
recognition
based
on
cards?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
--
but
that
won't
that
may
not
get
him
--
the
union
may
just
file
8
(b)
–
8
(a)
(5)
but
charges
on
them
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
care
how
many
cards
you've
got.
i
just
don't
like
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
can
get
an
election
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
your
rep
–
that's
represents
what
the
position
of
the
board
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
its
certainly
doesn't
emerge
from
your
briefs
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
this
been
--
has
this
always
been
the
practice
mr.
manoli?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
may
explain
in
times
since
i've
been
at
it
but
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
quite
a
bit.
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
this
articulated
in
the
board
opinion
somewhere
its
due?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
well
if
the
key
then
mr.
manoli
that
he
has
no
right
or
rather
the
board
will
not
recognize
that
he
should
not
be
concluded
by
cards
except
in
situations
where
there
some
kind
of
unfair
labor
practice
that
is
connected
with
his
refusal
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
court
recognition
based
on
current
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
--
and
even
then
his
right
to
insists
on
election
is
lost
only,
if
i
understood
you,
if
his
unfair
labor
practices
of
--
are
of
a
serious
nature?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
that
what
this
case
is
all
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
even
if
he
said,
“don't
waste
my
time,
go
to
an
election.”
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
manoli,
isn't
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
assume
the
union's
representative
come
to
the
employer
and
presents
his
cards
(inaudible)
it
says,
well
certainly
it
appears
that
you
have
a
majority
and
i
have
no
question
about
these
cards
and
you
still
like
you've
got
a
majority
of
the
workers
with
you
but
i
want
an
election.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
test
you
state
in
your
brief
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
is
whether
or
not
the
employer
has
a
good
faith
doubt
about
the
majority
status
of
the
union
and
that
unfair
labor
practice
is
only
a
material
element
in
judging
whether
or
not
he
had
a
good
faith
doubt.
now,
you're
stating
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
a
considerably
different
rule
in
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
the
rule
you're
stating
is
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
--
yes,
but
the
employer
says,
i
have
no
doubt
at
all
about
your
majority
status.
no
good
faith
--
i
have
no
good
faith
doubt
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
--
but
i
just
want
an
election.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
just
that
--let
me
--
the
employer
does
no
more
--
and
he
says.
he
says
explicit
--
i
have
no
good
faith
doubt
that
you
have
majority
there
but
i'm
not
going
to
recognize
you
without
an
election.
i
want
an
election.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
have
no
good
faith
doubt
that
you
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
doesn't
say,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--“i
don't
like
cards.”
he
says,
“i
want
an
election.”
justice
byron
r.
white
will
permit
him
--
will
permit
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
won't
--
and
they
will
not
have
met
then
say
that
he's
been
guilty
of
an
8
(a)
(5)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that
seems
to
me
considerably
different
test
that
you
got
in
your
brief
but
you
honestly
accept
it
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
he
wants
to
accept
this
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
if
he
has
a
mass
meeting
of
the
employees
said,
“do
you
fellows
really
want
this
union?”
and
unanimously
they
say,
“we
sure
do.”
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
has
to
recognize.
justice
byron
r.
white
getting
in
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say,
he
can
or
can
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
only
his
evidence
is
the
--
of
his
--
whether
he
knows
or
not
is
the
cards.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
he'd
have
the
election.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
he
has
a
good
faith
doubt?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
arguing
in
no
matter
what
decision
of
the
board
it
is
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
he
ask
employees,
did
you
sign
this
card?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
handwriting
against
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
take
it
that
you
would
say
that
the
employer
has
the
same
right
of
free
speech
at
that
time
and
the
pending
the
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
could
i
suppose
say
to
the
employees,
you
may
have
signed
these
cards
but
that
you
certainly
made
a
mistake
and
we
are
going
to
--
and
when
you
heard
the
whole
facts
you'll
vote
against
the
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
here's
why
--
and
here's
why
it
would
be
better
to
vote
against
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
mr.
--
and
mr.
manoli
says,
that
when
the
employer
asked
them
when
they'll
--
he'll
get
it.
did
you
understand
him
to
say
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
anything
more
behind
it
than
that,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
--
would
you
think
though
that
the
question
of
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practices
before
or
after
the
presentation
of
the
authorization
cards
--
those
unfair
labor
practices
are
relevant
to
deciding
whether
or
not
the
employer
has
a
duty
to
bargain?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
manoli
says
the
board
position
is,
the
employer
may
say,
“well
i
just
don't
like
cards.”
and
therefore,
the
employer
may
just
refuse
to
bargain
but
i
gather
that
position
is
that
if
he
convicts
him
unfair
labor
practices,
he
does
have
a
duty
to
bargain
regardless.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
could
you
ever
have
--
i
suppose
you
would
agree
though
that
the
unfair
labor
practices
are
decent
basis
for
avoiding
an
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
--
well,
if
you
start
committing
unfair
labor
practices
prior
to
an
election
or
if
you
continue
to
commit
them.
there
is
in
any
way
of
getting
of
a
fair
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
say
you
take
the
next
best
thing
cards.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
do
you
have
got
any
better
way
of
doing
it
because
the
employer
forecloses
it
better
way.
what
are
you
going
to
do
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
have
that
how
about
that
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
that
you're
willing
to
--
you're
willing
to
confine
your
statements
to
the
49%
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
let
say
the
60%
case
when
the
employer
says,
“yes,
you
have
60%
of
the
cards
and
i've
checked
all
the
signatures
on
these
cards.
they
are
perfectly
valid.
looks
like
you
got
it.”
but
i
still
don't
like
cards,
i
wand
an
election.
mr.
manoli
says,
the
employer
could
have
his
election
and
then
if
he
goes
and
commits
unfair
labor
practices.
what
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
then
about
being
ordered
to
bargain
on
the
basis
of
the
cards?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
kind
that
would
void
an
election
period.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
unfair
labor
practices
that
would
void
an
election.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
do
you
agree
with
the
gentleman
who
preceded
you
that
the
practice
of
the
board
is
to
dismissed
employer's
petition
for
an
election
if
the
union
has
filed
that
unfair
labor
practice
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
until
--
justice
byron
r.
white
until
--
justice
byron
r.
white
until
that's
resolved.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
if
it's
resolved
against
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
is
committed
unfair
labor
practices
in
the
course
of
checking
out
these
cards
before
that
a
man
he
says,
they
will
be
no
election,
you
must
bargain.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
union
asked
for
an
election,
they
will
hold
it?
and
if
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
lose
it,
the
employer
will
bargain
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
they
will
decide
the
unfair
labor
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
they
do
that
they
don't
--
why
would
they
just
order
him
the
bargain
if
the
charge
is
sustained?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
they
will
hold
the
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
they
hold
the
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
won't
order
him
to
bargain?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
--
would
you
object
the
--
what
objection
which
you
have
in
mr.
manoli's
version
of
what
the
board
position
is?
where
he
says
that
the
employer
says,
no
comment,
i
want
an
election.
he
need
not
bargain.
he
can
get
an
election
when
it
asks,
the
union
asks
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
i
know
but
that
is
what
i
--
let's
assume
that
were
the
board's
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
just
assume
that
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
exactly
what
the
board
would
do
in
any
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
doesn't
even
need
to
do
that.
you
can
say,
“i'm
just
not
going
to
bargain
with
you
and
wait
for
the
union
to
file.”
justice
byron
r.
white
would
this
solve
your
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
this
solve
your
problems?
at
least
that
to
the
kind
you're
talking
about
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
distinguish
between
the
time
that
would
initiate
the
employer
to
request
for
an
election
and
authorize
the
immediate
board
of
advisory
to
take
that
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
would
be
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
possibility
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
especially
now
you
justify
the
board
of
bargaining
vitiation
of
the
election
vis-à-vis
the
employer
in
order
to
bargain
with
the
employer
the
basic
content
of
the
facts
namely
that
the
possibility
of
having
a
fair
election
is
gone
or
do
you
say
it
really
it
should
go
back
and
say
this
bears
on
whether
or
not
there's
a
good
faith
doubt
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
a
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
he
gets
fired.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
unfair
charge
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
unfair
legal
practice
charge?
8
(a)
(1)
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(3)
and
(5).
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
the
basis
for
holding
that
they
violated
8
(a)
(1)
because
you
violated
8
(a)
(5)?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
an
--
this
is
an
independent
violation
of
8
(a)
(1)
without
the
words
you
use
violating
8
(a)
(1)?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
rationale
for
saying
that
without
violating
one
of
the
other
sections
you
can
violate
8
(a)
(1)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
said
the
words
that
you
used
violated
8
(a)
(1).
justice
byron
r.
white
in
light
that
you
violated
8
(a)
(1).
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i
think
they're
saying
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
they're
saying
that
because
you
violated
8
(a)
(1),
you
refused
to
bargain
by
not
recognizing
the
authorization
cards
because
by
the
violation
of
the
8
(a)
(1),
you
have
really
vitiated
the
chances
of
a
fair
election.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
board
is
certain
but
what
is
the
--
specifically,
how
do
you
--
what's
the
rationale
for
saying
you
violated
8
(a)
(1)
by
using
some
words
against
the
employers
when
you
haven't
violated
8
(a)
(3)?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
suggested
as
coercive?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
kind
of
coercive
words
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
violates
8
(a)
(1)?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
forget
8
(a)
(3)
then.
just
tell
me
what
why
is
that?
why
does
this
form
of
words
to
violate
8
(a)
(1)?
what
section
7
rights
are
being
interfered
with
by
using
these
words?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
board's
view
of
it?
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
board
write
--
did
the
board
itself
write
an
opinion
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
this
discussion
in
the
board's
brief?
is
that
--
is
that
what
you
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
question
about
the
--
about
whether
a
subsequent
election
changes
any
of
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
we
have
to
decide
that
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
we
have
to
decide
that
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
these
cases
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
do
that
to
decide
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
manoli,
what
is
the
board's
view
of
what
the
employer
must,
and
like
they
say,
what
is
there
position
that
he
must
take
before
the
board
that
will
recognize
that
he
may
insist
on
an
election
rather
than
to
a
court
recognition
based
on
cards?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
--
but
that
won't
that
may
not
get
him
--
the
union
may
just
file
8
(b)
–
8
(a)
(5)
but
charges
on
them
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
care
how
many
cards
you've
got.
i
just
don't
like
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
can
get
an
election
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
your
rep
–
that's
represents
what
the
position
of
the
board
is
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
its
certainly
doesn't
emerge
from
your
briefs
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
this
been
--
has
this
always
been
the
practice
mr.
manoli?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
may
explain
in
times
since
i've
been
at
it
but
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
quite
a
bit.
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
this
articulated
in
the
board
opinion
somewhere
its
due?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
well
if
the
key
then
mr.
manoli
that
he
has
no
right
or
rather
the
board
will
not
recognize
that
he
should
not
be
concluded
by
cards
except
in
situations
where
there
some
kind
of
unfair
labor
practice
that
is
connected
with
his
refusal
to
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
court
recognition
based
on
current
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
--
and
even
then
his
right
to
insists
on
election
is
lost
only,
if
i
understood
you,
if
his
unfair
labor
practices
of
--
are
of
a
serious
nature?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
that
what
this
case
is
all
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
even
if
he
said,
“don't
waste
my
time,
go
to
an
election.”
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
manoli,
isn't
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
assume
the
union's
representative
come
to
the
employer
and
presents
his
cards
(inaudible)
it
says,
well
certainly
it
appears
that
you
have
a
majority
and
i
have
no
question
about
these
cards
and
you
still
like
you've
got
a
majority
of
the
workers
with
you
but
i
want
an
election.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
test
you
state
in
your
brief
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
is
whether
or
not
the
employer
has
a
good
faith
doubt
about
the
majority
status
of
the
union
and
that
unfair
labor
practice
is
only
a
material
element
in
judging
whether
or
not
he
had
a
good
faith
doubt.
now,
you're
stating
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
a
considerably
different
rule
in
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
the
rule
you're
stating
is
different?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
that
--
yes,
but
the
employer
says,
i
have
no
doubt
at
all
about
your
majority
status.
no
good
faith
--
i
have
no
good
faith
doubt
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
--
but
i
just
want
an
election.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
just
that
--let
me
--
the
employer
does
no
more
--
and
he
says.
he
says
explicit
--
i
have
no
good
faith
doubt
that
you
have
majority
there
but
i'm
not
going
to
recognize
you
without
an
election.
i
want
an
election.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
have
no
good
faith
doubt
that
you
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
doesn't
say,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--“i
don't
like
cards.”
he
says,
“i
want
an
election.”
justice
byron
r.
white
will
permit
him
--
will
permit
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
won't
--
and
they
will
not
have
met
then
say
that
he's
been
guilty
of
an
8
(a)
(5)
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that
seems
to
me
considerably
different
test
that
you
got
in
your
brief
but
you
honestly
accept
it
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright.
he
wants
to
accept
this
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
if
he
has
a
mass
meeting
of
the
employees
said,
“do
you
fellows
really
want
this
union?”
and
unanimously
they
say,
“we
sure
do.”
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
has
to
recognize.
justice
byron
r.
white
getting
in
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say,
he
can
or
can
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
is
only
his
evidence
is
the
--
of
his
--
whether
he
knows
or
not
is
the
cards.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
he'd
have
the
election.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
he
has
a
good
faith
doubt?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you're
arguing
in
no
matter
what
decision
of
the
board
it
is
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
he
ask
employees,
did
you
sign
this
card?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
the
handwriting
against
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
take
it
that
you
would
say
that
the
employer
has
the
same
right
of
free
speech
at
that
time
and
the
pending
the
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
could
i
suppose
say
to
the
employees,
you
may
have
signed
these
cards
but
that
you
certainly
made
a
mistake
and
we
are
going
to
--
and
when
you
heard
the
whole
facts
you'll
vote
against
the
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
here's
why
--
and
here's
why
it
would
be
better
to
vote
against
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
mr.
--
and
mr.
manoli
says,
that
when
the
employer
asked
them
when
they'll
--
he'll
get
it.
did
you
understand
him
to
say
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
anything
more
behind
it
than
that,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
--
would
you
think
though
that
the
question
of
the
employer's
unfair
labor
practices
before
or
after
the
presentation
of
the
authorization
cards
--
those
unfair
labor
practices
are
relevant
to
deciding
whether
or
not
the
employer
has
a
duty
to
bargain?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
manoli
says
the
board
position
is,
the
employer
may
say,
“well
i
just
don't
like
cards.”
and
therefore,
the
employer
may
just
refuse
to
bargain
but
i
gather
that
position
is
that
if
he
convicts
him
unfair
labor
practices,
he
does
have
a
duty
to
bargain
regardless.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
could
you
ever
have
--
i
suppose
you
would
agree
though
that
the
unfair
labor
practices
are
decent
basis
for
avoiding
an
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
--
well,
if
you
start
committing
unfair
labor
practices
prior
to
an
election
or
if
you
continue
to
commit
them.
there
is
in
any
way
of
getting
of
a
fair
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
say
you
take
the
next
best
thing
cards.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
but
do
you
have
got
any
better
way
of
doing
it
because
the
employer
forecloses
it
better
way.
what
are
you
going
to
do
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
just
have
that
how
about
that
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
that
you're
willing
to
--
you're
willing
to
confine
your
statements
to
the
49%
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
let
say
the
60%
case
when
the
employer
says,
“yes,
you
have
60%
of
the
cards
and
i've
checked
all
the
signatures
on
these
cards.
they
are
perfectly
valid.
looks
like
you
got
it.”
but
i
still
don't
like
cards,
i
wand
an
election.
mr.
manoli
says,
the
employer
could
have
his
election
and
then
if
he
goes
and
commits
unfair
labor
practices.
what
then
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
then
about
being
ordered
to
bargain
on
the
basis
of
the
cards?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
kind
that
would
void
an
election
period.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
unfair
labor
practices
that
would
void
an
election.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
do
you
agree
with
the
gentleman
who
preceded
you
that
the
practice
of
the
board
is
to
dismissed
employer's
petition
for
an
election
if
the
union
has
filed
that
unfair
labor
practice
charge?
justice
byron
r.
white
until
--
justice
byron
r.
white
until
--
justice
byron
r.
white
until
that's
resolved.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
if
it's
resolved
against
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
is
committed
unfair
labor
practices
in
the
course
of
checking
out
these
cards
before
that
a
man
he
says,
they
will
be
no
election,
you
must
bargain.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
union
asked
for
an
election,
they
will
hold
it?
and
if
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they
lose
it,
the
employer
will
bargain
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
they
will
decide
the
unfair
labor
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
they
do
that
they
don't
--
why
would
they
just
order
him
the
bargain
if
the
charge
is
sustained?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
they
will
hold
the
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
they
hold
the
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
won't
order
him
to
bargain?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
--
would
you
object
the
--
what
objection
which
you
have
in
mr.
manoli's
version
of
what
the
board
position
is?
where
he
says
that
the
employer
says,
no
comment,
i
want
an
election.
he
need
not
bargain.
he
can
get
an
election
when
it
asks,
the
union
asks
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes
i
know
but
that
is
what
i
--
let's
assume
that
were
the
board's
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
just
assume
that
it
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
exactly
what
the
board
would
do
in
any
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
doesn't
even
need
to
do
that.
you
can
say,
“i'm
just
not
going
to
bargain
with
you
and
wait
for
the
union
to
file.”
justice
byron
r.
white
would
this
solve
your
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
this
solve
your
problems?
at
least
that
to
the
kind
you're
talking
about
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
distinguish
between
the
time
that
would
initiate
the
employer
to
request
for
an
election
and
authorize
the
immediate
board
of
advisory
to
take
that
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
that
would
be
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
possibility
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
especially
now
you
justify
the
board
of
bargaining
vitiation
of
the
election
vis-à-vis
the
employer
in
order
to
bargain
with
the
employer
the
basic
content
of
the
facts
namely
that
the
possibility
of
having
a
fair
election
is
gone
or
do
you
say
it
really
it
should
go
back
and
say
this
bears
on
whether
or
not
there's
a
good
faith
doubt
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
a
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
he
gets
fired.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
unfair
charge
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
unfair
legal
practice
charge?
8
(a)
(1)
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
(3)
and
(5).
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
the
basis
for
holding
that
they
violated
8
(a)
(1)
because
you
violated
8
(a)
(5)?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
thought.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
an
--
this
is
an
independent
violation
of
8
(a)
(1)
without
the
words
you
use
violating
8
(a)
(1)?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
rationale
for
saying
that
without
violating
one
of
the
other
sections
you
can
violate
8
(a)
(1)?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
said
the
words
that
you
used
violated
8
(a)
(1).
justice
byron
r.
white
in
light
that
you
violated
8
(a)
(1).
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
i
think
they're
saying
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
they're
saying
that
because
you
violated
8
(a)
(1),
you
refused
to
bargain
by
not
recognizing
the
authorization
cards
because
by
the
violation
of
the
8
(a)
(1),
you
have
really
vitiated
the
chances
of
a
fair
election.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
board
is
certain
but
what
is
the
--
specifically,
how
do
you
--
what's
the
rationale
for
saying
you
violated
8
(a)
(1)
by
using
some
words
against
the
employers
when
you
haven't
violated
8
(a)
(3)?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
suggested
as
coercive?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
kind
of
coercive
words
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
violates
8
(a)
(1)?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
forget
8
(a)
(3)
then.
just
tell
me
what
why
is
that?
why
does
this
form
of
words
to
violate
8
(a)
(1)?
what
section
7
rights
are
being
interfered
with
by
using
these
words?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
the
board's
view
of
it?
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
board
write
--
did
the
board
itself
write
an
opinion
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
this
discussion
in
the
board's
brief?
is
that
--
is
that
what
you
mean?
