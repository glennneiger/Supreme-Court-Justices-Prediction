mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
to
the
court
having
heard
this
general
discussion
of
the
principles
that
are
involved
in
the
issues
in
this
case.
if
we
take
gissel
as
an
example
from
a
factual
standpoint
and
see
how
the
application
of
these
principles
came
up
with
one
little
sausage
maker
back
in
the
hills
of
west
virginia.
back
in
the
1960's
about
1961,
this
union
started
a
massive
organization
campaign
in
the
retail
food
industry
there
and
it
attempted
to
organize
the
logan
packing
company,
the
gissel
packing
company
and
many
other
companies.
petitions
were
filed,
cards
were
taken
up
and
the
union
claimed
that
had
a
majority
of
the
employees.
and
in
1961,
the
national
labor
relations
board
came
in,
pitched
its
tents
in
this
company
premises,
in
order
the
employees
in
to
vote
without
the
president
of
the
company
hanging
over
their
shoulder
or
without
the
union
organizer
paying
over
their
and
a
free
expression
of
their
wishes.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
among
the
petition
of
the
union.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
and
when
this
occurred
and
the
union
having
represented
as
it
must
have
been
a
necessity
that
it
had
a
majority
because
it
had
demanded
recognition
before
that
in
these
cases.
the
employees
and
all
of
these
companies
rejected
the
union.
three
or
four
years
past
and
the
union
was
still
under
great
pressure
from
its
clients
william
p.
krueger
and
the
big
chains
to
organize
this
industry.
this
was
no
spontaneous
rising
with
union
interest
of
the
employees
in
this
companies
and
they
started
in
with
the
new
technique
which
the
board
had
developed
for
them
that
is
on
trial
before
your
--
this
court
today,
the
authorization
card
technique.
and
in
january
of
1965,
they
contacted
gissel,
my
client,
and
said,
“we
represent
the
majority
of
your
employees
bargain
with
us
or
we'll
file
unfair
labor
practices
against
you.
we
got
some
cards.”
now,
gissel
people
had
been
down
this
road
before.
they
knew
these
cards
were
unreliable.
they
had
knew
the
propensities
of
this
union
to
overstate
its
claim
or
its
case
of
representation.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
there
had
been
cards
submitted
by
the
union
to
the
board
as
a
prerequisite
to
getting
the
election.
there
had
not
been
authorization
cards
as
i
understand
it
submitted
to
the
company,
your
honor.
and
so,
the
company
immediately
responded
to
this
request
and
they
said
this,
“we
don't
have
any
confidence
in
these
cards.”
secondly,
why
not
let's
get
this
thing
settled
properly
by
a
fair
and
honest
election,
and
wrote
the
union
a
letter
and
asked
them
to
petition
for
an
election.
now,
it
is
an
act
of
complete
futility
for
an
employer
in
these
circumstances
to
file
a
petition
for
election.
we
did
it
in
sehon
stevenson,
it
was
refused.
we
did
it
in
davis
wholesale,
it
was
refused.
we
did
it
in
logan
packing
company,
it
was
refused.
in
gissel,
the
company
wrote
a
letter
to
the
union
and
invited
them
to
file
the
petition
and
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
i
certainly
did
and
its
most
and
like.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
--
i
asked
time
and
again,
and
we
did
not
get
it.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
no,
sir.
in
this
case,
we
decided
to
try
a
different
attack
we
thought
maybe
the
union
has
more
persuasive
authority
with
the
board
than
we
do.
let's
write
the
union
a
letter
and
suggest
a
quick
consent
election
and
maybe
if
they
petition
they
can
get
it
because
this
is
what
we
want.
of
course,
they
didn't
want
an
election
because
they
knew
they
didn't
represent
a
majority
of
this
people.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
thought
it
was
a
few
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
feel
--
we
thought
it
was
futile
act
your
honor
and
in
logan
packing
company,
we
did
file
the
petition
and
it
was
thrown
out
in
davis
wholesale
company
currently
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
dc
circuit,
we
filed
it
and
it
was
thrown
out
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
they
said
it,
we're
going
--
you're
going
to
have
to
honor
those
cards.
you've
got
to
accept
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
there
were
collateral.
unfair
labor
practices
of
the
company
involved
of
supervisors
of
the
company.
now
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
i
don't
know.
it
is
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
the
board
so
found.
yes,
sir.
state
coercive
statements
of
some
people
--
they
didn't
like
the
union
expressions
of
opinion
which
the
board
found
were
coercive
and
unfair
labor
practices.
now
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
they
found
that
as
part
of
this
case
which
is
here
now
in
which
they
found
that
the
company
had
committed
some
other
peripheral
unfair
labor
practices
and
that
it
had
a
duty
to
bargain
with
the
union
on
basis
of
these
cards
alone.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
the
--
the
hearing
your
honor
was
all
combined
in
one
hearing.
the
election
and
card
question
and
the
unfair
labor
practices
were
all
in
one
hearing.
we
did
not
ask
for
an
election.
in
this
case,
we
wrote
a
letter
to
the
union
when
the
demand
was
originally
made
we're
suggesting
that
they
petition
for
an
election
in
this
case.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
because
you
see
your
honor,
we
felt
and
we
believe
the
law
so
provides.
if
you
read
section
9,
it
never
says
in
there
that
the
employer
must
petition.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
it's
a
right
that
he
has
but
certainly
he's
rights
in
the
matter
should
not
be
determined
until
whether
he
file,
initiates
a
petition
of
the
union.
the
union
is
the
one
that
is
asking
for
recognition.
the
board
had
uniformly
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
this
is
true.
then
if
the
--
if
the
union
then
still
wants
recognition,
they
have
this
avenue
open
to
them
to
go
and
ask
for
an
election
if
they
want
it.
we
simply
suggest
it
to
them
in
this
case
if
they
do
this.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
they
were
on
both
sides
chronologically.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
on
both
sides
chronologically.
most
of
the
alleged
unfair
labor
practices
occurred
subsequent
to
the
dates
on
this
authorization
cards.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
evidence
to
that
effect
then
that
board
accepted
it.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the
--
the
cards
were
submitted
and
then
statements
were
made.
i'm
not
sure
in
my
mind
about
the
chronology
of
each
of
these
incidents
that
you're
talking
about
there
they
were
all
and
relatively
the
same
general
period
of
time
there.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
wrote
a
union
--
a
letter
to
the
union
asking
them
to
ask
for
it
and
suggesting
it.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
thought
it
was
a
free
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
have
--
we
had
a
right
to
petition
the
election.
we
did
it
in
the
companion
cases.
the
board
refused
it
and
so
we
decided
in
gissel
to
simply
suggest
to
the
union
do
it.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
--
i
do
not
think
your
honor
that
that
the
two
are
related
to
each
other.
you
see,
there
is
a
question
of
who
is
going
to
represent
the
employees.
the
whole
structure
of
the
labor
law
is
to
preserve
the
rights
of
employees.
they
are
not
apprise
over
which
a
union
and
a
company,
fights.
the
question
of
representation
of
them
and
there
freedom
of
choice
is
one
thing
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
board
and
there
an
employer
or
union's
unfair
labor
practices
are
something
separate
and
distinct
from
that.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
that
is
true.
as
long
as
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
--
we
don't
think
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
hope
your
honor
that
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech
of
any
citizen
of
the
country
is
not
contention
upon
him
filing
a
paper
with
the
national
labor
relations
board.
we
think
he
has
that
right
inherently
god
given
whether
he
files
a
petition
or
anything
else.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
i
do
not
think
the
law
says
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
have
our
differences
of
what
freedom
of
speech
is
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
did
not
think
that
the
law
employers'
rights
of
freedom
of
speech
were
conditioned
upon
him
filing
a
paper
of
any
kind
with
anybody.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
wrote
that
to
try
to
see
if
by
this
means,
we
could
get
this
question
resolved
properly
and
fairly.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
had
tried
the
employer
petition
and
failed
and
so
we
thought
we
try
the
union
side
of
it.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
pardon
sir.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
no.
this
is
true.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
this
is
true.
but
we
don't
think
your
honor
that
an
employers'
rights
of
what
his
conduct
is
or
dependent
upon
whether
he
initiates
a
petition
or
whether
a
union
initiates
a
petition
and
certainly
not
insofar
as
rights
as
fundamental
as
free
speech.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
it's
a
matter
of
board
policy
and
that
is
the
only
reason
--
it
is
the
matter
of
board
policy
that
they
want
to
merge
unfair
labor
practices
and
representation
questions
together.
confuse
the
two
and
not
decide
on
representation
questions
until
unfair
questions
are
determined.
and
so
if
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
that
is
my
gloss
on
what
they
do.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
what
they
said
was
they
wrote
a
letter
and
said
since
--
let
me
go
back
in
this
case
to
make
it
clear
again.
of
course,
we
did
not
file
a
petition.
in
logan
we
did,
so
i'll
have
to
answer
you
in
terms
of
logan,
in
davis,
in
sehon,
and
all
the
others.
in
those
cases,
we
filed
the
petition
promptly.
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
union
as
soon
as
they
got
the
petition,
they
didn't
want
an
election.
so
they
filed
the
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
they
know
that
by
doing
this
automatically
by
the
board
rule
blocks
the
election
and
then,
in
the
next
return
of
mail,
the
letter
from
the
board
office
in
cincinnati
comes
back
to
us
in
huntington
saying,
“the
union
has
filed
unfair
labor
practice
charges
against
you.
therefore,
we
are
going
to
dismiss
your
petition
for
the
election.”
and
that's
what
we're
doing.
it's
their
policy.
they
equate
the
two
of
these
things
you
see
together.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
--
i
think
it's
a
matter
entirely
of
employer's
discretion.
there
is
nowhere
in
the
law
in
number
one
that
says,
“in
order
to
get
certain
rights
or
to
get
certain
protections,
an
employer
must
file
a
petition.”
section
9
of
the
labor
relations
act
says
nothing
about
who
has
to
initiate
this.
in
fact,
the
solicitor
general
of
the
--
here
says,
that
he
makes
no
difference
who
initiates
the
petition.
only
counsel
for
the
union
takes
this
rather
strange
view
that
it
makes
a
difference
in
that
--
that
the
employer
under
peril
are
being
found
guilty
of
unfair
labor
practices
must
rush
to
cincinnati
and
file
this
petition
in
order
to
protect
his
right
of
free
speech.
that
is
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
did
not
object
to
it.
we
simply
didn't
do
it
because
we
thought
--
no,
i
said,
why
would
you
now
in
response
to
my
question?
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
an
employer's
rights
in
this
situation
should
not
be
dependent
upon
his
filing
a
paper.
either
he
has
an
obligation
under
the
law
to
recognize
this
union
or
he
doesn't.
and
i
don't
see
that
his
rights
in
the
manner
are
dependent
upon
whether
he
files
a
paper
or
who
files
a
paper.
what
we're
really
trying
to
get
to
is
a
speedy
resolution
and
the
problem
is
how
we
do
it
over
what
these
people
really
want.
that's
a
problem
that
we've
got.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
they
are
your
honor.
they
don't
prove
a
thing.
this
is
the
great
assumption
which
goes
without
critical
analysis
in
all
of
these.
let
me
give
some,
for
instance
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
that's
what
he
says.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
this
is
what
the
board
is
saying
apparently.
but
the
two
are
two
different
animals.
there
are
different
things.
let
me
give
you
for
instance
facts
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
this
presume
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
if
the
election
--
if
the
board
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
cards
even
by
the
board
apparently
now,
it's
inherent
when
the
board's
argument
this
morning,
that
cards
are
inherently
suspect
and
unreliable.
otherwise,
they
couldn't
justify
an
employer
in
rejecting
them
out
of
hand.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
well,
let's
take
the
shoe
in
other
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i'm
sorry.
the
employer
refuses
to
recognize
the
union
and
then
there
are
some
--
and
the
board
says,
on
the
basis
of
cards
alone,
you
could
assume
--
we
could
assume
that
you
feel
only
49%
of
the
employees
really
want
the
union
and
therefore,
you
are
justified
in
refusing
recognition.
then,
let
a
supervisor
of
the
company
go
out
and
make
some
coercive
statements
or
let
there
be
some
other
unfair
labor
practices
and
then
the
board
says,
“oh,
oh,
something
has
change.”
now,
you
added
this
other
ingredient
and
this
proves
to
us
that
you
didn't
really
feel
that
there
was
only
49%.
we
now
realize
that
you
thought
there
was
51%.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
either
one.
i
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
well,
your
honor
what
kind
of
unfair
labor
practices?
are
they
unfair
labor
practices
that
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
but
the
problem
is
that
in
the
gissel
case,
there
is
no
finding
of
fact
anywhere
to
that
effect.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
if
they
are
unfair
labor
practices,
then
they
should
order
the
election,
if
the
union
is
not
satisfied
with
the
outcome
of
the
election.
there
is
a
procedure
there
where
they
can
get
to
there
very
question
that
your
honor
raises.
that
is
things
the
employer
did
made
an
unfair
election
and
therefore,
the
board
can
set
it
aside.
it
--
suppose
on
the
other
hand,
the
union
commits
unfair
labor
practices
when
they
are
seeking
recognition.
what
happens
then?
does
the
board
say,
“we're
not
going
to
let
you
in
for
a
year
because
you
have
made
an
election
unfair
or
impossible
because
of
your
8
(b)
(1)
course
of
acts,
oh
no.
when
the
shoe
is
on
the
other
foot,
what
is
the
union
--
what
does
the
board
do?
the
board
says
to
the
union,
“you
close
to
a
little
notice
and
say
for
60
days
you
won't
do
it
anymore
and
then
at
the
end
of
60
days,
they
go
on
and
hold
election.”
you
see,
it
depends
on
whose
ox
is
being
gored.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
to
the
court
having
heard
this
general
discussion
of
the
principles
that
are
involved
in
the
issues
in
this
case.
if
we
take
gissel
as
an
example
from
a
factual
standpoint
and
see
how
the
application
of
these
principles
came
up
with
one
little
sausage
maker
back
in
the
hills
of
west
virginia.
back
in
the
1960's
about
1961,
this
union
started
a
massive
organization
campaign
in
the
retail
food
industry
there
and
it
attempted
to
organize
the
logan
packing
company,
the
gissel
packing
company
and
many
other
companies.
petitions
were
filed,
cards
were
taken
up
and
the
union
claimed
that
had
a
majority
of
the
employees.
and
in
1961,
the
national
labor
relations
board
came
in,
pitched
its
tents
in
this
company
premises,
in
order
the
employees
in
to
vote
without
the
president
of
the
company
hanging
over
their
shoulder
or
without
the
union
organizer
paying
over
their
and
a
free
expression
of
their
wishes.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
among
the
petition
of
the
union.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
and
when
this
occurred
and
the
union
having
represented
as
it
must
have
been
a
necessity
that
it
had
a
majority
because
it
had
demanded
recognition
before
that
in
these
cases.
the
employees
and
all
of
these
companies
rejected
the
union.
three
or
four
years
past
and
the
union
was
still
under
great
pressure
from
its
clients
william
p.
krueger
and
the
big
chains
to
organize
this
industry.
this
was
no
spontaneous
rising
with
union
interest
of
the
employees
in
this
companies
and
they
started
in
with
the
new
technique
which
the
board
had
developed
for
them
that
is
on
trial
before
your
--
this
court
today,
the
authorization
card
technique.
and
in
january
of
1965,
they
contacted
gissel,
my
client,
and
said,
“we
represent
the
majority
of
your
employees
bargain
with
us
or
we'll
file
unfair
labor
practices
against
you.
we
got
some
cards.”
now,
gissel
people
had
been
down
this
road
before.
they
knew
these
cards
were
unreliable.
they
had
knew
the
propensities
of
this
union
to
overstate
its
claim
or
its
case
of
representation.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
there
had
been
cards
submitted
by
the
union
to
the
board
as
a
prerequisite
to
getting
the
election.
there
had
not
been
authorization
cards
as
i
understand
it
submitted
to
the
company,
your
honor.
and
so,
the
company
immediately
responded
to
this
request
and
they
said
this,
“we
don't
have
any
confidence
in
these
cards.”
secondly,
why
not
let's
get
this
thing
settled
properly
by
a
fair
and
honest
election,
and
wrote
the
union
a
letter
and
asked
them
to
petition
for
an
election.
now,
it
is
an
act
of
complete
futility
for
an
employer
in
these
circumstances
to
file
a
petition
for
election.
we
did
it
in
sehon
stevenson,
it
was
refused.
we
did
it
in
davis
wholesale,
it
was
refused.
we
did
it
in
logan
packing
company,
it
was
refused.
in
gissel,
the
company
wrote
a
letter
to
the
union
and
invited
them
to
file
the
petition
and
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
i
certainly
did
and
its
most
and
like.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
--
i
asked
time
and
again,
and
we
did
not
get
it.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
no,
sir.
in
this
case,
we
decided
to
try
a
different
attack
we
thought
maybe
the
union
has
more
persuasive
authority
with
the
board
than
we
do.
let's
write
the
union
a
letter
and
suggest
a
quick
consent
election
and
maybe
if
they
petition
they
can
get
it
because
this
is
what
we
want.
of
course,
they
didn't
want
an
election
because
they
knew
they
didn't
represent
a
majority
of
this
people.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
thought
it
was
a
few
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
feel
--
we
thought
it
was
futile
act
your
honor
and
in
logan
packing
company,
we
did
file
the
petition
and
it
was
thrown
out
in
davis
wholesale
company
currently
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
dc
circuit,
we
filed
it
and
it
was
thrown
out
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
they
said
it,
we're
going
--
you're
going
to
have
to
honor
those
cards.
you've
got
to
accept
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
there
were
collateral.
unfair
labor
practices
of
the
company
involved
of
supervisors
of
the
company.
now
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
i
don't
know.
it
is
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
the
board
so
found.
yes,
sir.
state
coercive
statements
of
some
people
--
they
didn't
like
the
union
expressions
of
opinion
which
the
board
found
were
coercive
and
unfair
labor
practices.
now
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
they
found
that
as
part
of
this
case
which
is
here
now
in
which
they
found
that
the
company
had
committed
some
other
peripheral
unfair
labor
practices
and
that
it
had
a
duty
to
bargain
with
the
union
on
basis
of
these
cards
alone.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
the
--
the
hearing
your
honor
was
all
combined
in
one
hearing.
the
election
and
card
question
and
the
unfair
labor
practices
were
all
in
one
hearing.
we
did
not
ask
for
an
election.
in
this
case,
we
wrote
a
letter
to
the
union
when
the
demand
was
originally
made
we're
suggesting
that
they
petition
for
an
election
in
this
case.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
because
you
see
your
honor,
we
felt
and
we
believe
the
law
so
provides.
if
you
read
section
9,
it
never
says
in
there
that
the
employer
must
petition.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
it's
a
right
that
he
has
but
certainly
he's
rights
in
the
matter
should
not
be
determined
until
whether
he
file,
initiates
a
petition
of
the
union.
the
union
is
the
one
that
is
asking
for
recognition.
the
board
had
uniformly
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
this
is
true.
then
if
the
--
if
the
union
then
still
wants
recognition,
they
have
this
avenue
open
to
them
to
go
and
ask
for
an
election
if
they
want
it.
we
simply
suggest
it
to
them
in
this
case
if
they
do
this.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
they
were
on
both
sides
chronologically.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
on
both
sides
chronologically.
most
of
the
alleged
unfair
labor
practices
occurred
subsequent
to
the
dates
on
this
authorization
cards.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
evidence
to
that
effect
then
that
board
accepted
it.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the
--
the
cards
were
submitted
and
then
statements
were
made.
i'm
not
sure
in
my
mind
about
the
chronology
of
each
of
these
incidents
that
you're
talking
about
there
they
were
all
and
relatively
the
same
general
period
of
time
there.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
no,
sir.
we
wrote
a
union
--
a
letter
to
the
union
asking
them
to
ask
for
it
and
suggesting
it.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
thought
it
was
a
free
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
have
--
we
had
a
right
to
petition
the
election.
we
did
it
in
the
companion
cases.
the
board
refused
it
and
so
we
decided
in
gissel
to
simply
suggest
to
the
union
do
it.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
--
i
do
not
think
your
honor
that
that
the
two
are
related
to
each
other.
you
see,
there
is
a
question
of
who
is
going
to
represent
the
employees.
the
whole
structure
of
the
labor
law
is
to
preserve
the
rights
of
employees.
they
are
not
apprise
over
which
a
union
and
a
company,
fights.
the
question
of
representation
of
them
and
there
freedom
of
choice
is
one
thing
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
board
and
there
an
employer
or
union's
unfair
labor
practices
are
something
separate
and
distinct
from
that.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
that
is
true.
as
long
as
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
--
we
don't
think
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
hope
your
honor
that
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech
of
any
citizen
of
the
country
is
not
contention
upon
him
filing
a
paper
with
the
national
labor
relations
board.
we
think
he
has
that
right
inherently
god
given
whether
he
files
a
petition
or
anything
else.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
i
do
not
think
the
law
says
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
have
our
differences
of
what
freedom
of
speech
is
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
did
not
think
that
the
law
employers'
rights
of
freedom
of
speech
were
conditioned
upon
him
filing
a
paper
of
any
kind
with
anybody.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
wrote
that
to
try
to
see
if
by
this
means,
we
could
get
this
question
resolved
properly
and
fairly.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
had
tried
the
employer
petition
and
failed
and
so
we
thought
we
try
the
union
side
of
it.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
pardon
sir.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
no.
this
is
true.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
this
is
true.
but
we
don't
think
your
honor
that
an
employers'
rights
of
what
his
conduct
is
or
dependent
upon
whether
he
initiates
a
petition
or
whether
a
union
initiates
a
petition
and
certainly
not
insofar
as
rights
as
fundamental
as
free
speech.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
it's
a
matter
of
board
policy
and
that
is
the
only
reason
--
it
is
the
matter
of
board
policy
that
they
want
to
merge
unfair
labor
practices
and
representation
questions
together.
confuse
the
two
and
not
decide
on
representation
questions
until
unfair
questions
are
determined.
and
so
if
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
that
is
my
gloss
on
what
they
do.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
what
they
said
was
they
wrote
a
letter
and
said
since
--
let
me
go
back
in
this
case
to
make
it
clear
again.
of
course,
we
did
not
file
a
petition.
in
logan
we
did,
so
i'll
have
to
answer
you
in
terms
of
logan,
in
davis,
in
sehon,
and
all
the
others.
in
those
cases,
we
filed
the
petition
promptly.
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
union
as
soon
as
they
got
the
petition,
they
didn't
want
an
election.
so
they
filed
the
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
they
know
that
by
doing
this
automatically
by
the
board
rule
blocks
the
election
and
then,
in
the
next
return
of
mail,
the
letter
from
the
board
office
in
cincinnati
comes
back
to
us
in
huntington
saying,
“the
union
has
filed
unfair
labor
practice
charges
against
you.
therefore,
we
are
going
to
dismiss
your
petition
for
the
election.”
and
that's
what
we're
doing.
it's
their
policy.
they
equate
the
two
of
these
things
you
see
together.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
do
not
--
i
think
it's
a
matter
entirely
of
employer's
discretion.
there
is
nowhere
in
the
law
in
number
one
that
says,
“in
order
to
get
certain
rights
or
to
get
certain
protections,
an
employer
must
file
a
petition.”
section
9
of
the
labor
relations
act
says
nothing
about
who
has
to
initiate
this.
in
fact,
the
solicitor
general
of
the
--
here
says,
that
he
makes
no
difference
who
initiates
the
petition.
only
counsel
for
the
union
takes
this
rather
strange
view
that
it
makes
a
difference
in
that
--
that
the
employer
under
peril
are
being
found
guilty
of
unfair
labor
practices
must
rush
to
cincinnati
and
file
this
petition
in
order
to
protect
his
right
of
free
speech.
that
is
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
we
did
not
object
to
it.
we
simply
didn't
do
it
because
we
thought
--
no,
i
said,
why
would
you
now
in
response
to
my
question?
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
an
employer's
rights
in
this
situation
should
not
be
dependent
upon
his
filing
a
paper.
either
he
has
an
obligation
under
the
law
to
recognize
this
union
or
he
doesn't.
and
i
don't
see
that
his
rights
in
the
manner
are
dependent
upon
whether
he
files
a
paper
or
who
files
a
paper.
what
we're
really
trying
to
get
to
is
a
speedy
resolution
and
the
problem
is
how
we
do
it
over
what
these
people
really
want.
that's
a
problem
that
we've
got.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
they
are
your
honor.
they
don't
prove
a
thing.
this
is
the
great
assumption
which
goes
without
critical
analysis
in
all
of
these.
let
me
give
some,
for
instance
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
that's
what
he
says.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
this
is
what
the
board
is
saying
apparently.
but
the
two
are
two
different
animals.
there
are
different
things.
let
me
give
you
for
instance
facts
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
this
presume
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
if
the
election
--
if
the
board
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
cards
even
by
the
board
apparently
now,
it's
inherent
when
the
board's
argument
this
morning,
that
cards
are
inherently
suspect
and
unreliable.
otherwise,
they
couldn't
justify
an
employer
in
rejecting
them
out
of
hand.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
well,
let's
take
the
shoe
in
other
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i'm
sorry.
the
employer
refuses
to
recognize
the
union
and
then
there
are
some
--
and
the
board
says,
on
the
basis
of
cards
alone,
you
could
assume
--
we
could
assume
that
you
feel
only
49%
of
the
employees
really
want
the
union
and
therefore,
you
are
justified
in
refusing
recognition.
then,
let
a
supervisor
of
the
company
go
out
and
make
some
coercive
statements
or
let
there
be
some
other
unfair
labor
practices
and
then
the
board
says,
“oh,
oh,
something
has
change.”
now,
you
added
this
other
ingredient
and
this
proves
to
us
that
you
didn't
really
feel
that
there
was
only
49%.
we
now
realize
that
you
thought
there
was
51%.
mr.

either
one.
i
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
well
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
well,
your
honor
what
kind
of
unfair
labor
practices?
are
they
unfair
labor
practices
that
--
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
but
the
problem
is
that
in
the
gissel
case,
there
is
no
finding
of
fact
anywhere
to
that
effect.
mr.
john
e.
jenkins,
jr.
if
they
are
unfair
labor
practices,
then
they
should
order
the
election,
if
the
union
is
not
satisfied
with
the
outcome
of
the
election.
there
is
a
procedure
there
where
they
can
get
to
there
very
question
that
your
honor
raises.
that
is
things
the
employer
did
made
an
unfair
election
and
therefore,
the
board
can
set
it
aside.
it
--
suppose
on
the
other
hand,
the
union
commits
unfair
labor
practices
when
they
are
seeking
recognition.
what
happens
then?
does
the
board
say,
“we're
not
going
to
let
you
in
for
a
year
because
you
have
made
an
election
unfair
or
impossible
because
of
your
8
(b)
(1)
course
of
acts,
oh
no.
when
the
shoe
is
on
the
other
foot,
what
is
the
union
--
what
does
the
board
do?
the
board
says
to
the
union,
“you
close
to
a
little
notice
and
say
for
60
days
you
won't
do
it
anymore
and
then
at
the
end
of
60
days,
they
go
on
and
hold
election.”
you
see,
it
depends
on
whose
ox
is
being
gored.
i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
