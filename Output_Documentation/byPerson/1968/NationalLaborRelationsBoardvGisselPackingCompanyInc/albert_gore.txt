mr.
albert
gore
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
in
the
anomalous
position
of
having
to
come
to
this
court
to
argue
a
case
in
conjunction
with
the
board
with
some
slight
differences
and
now
in
the
position
of
having
to
take
the
position
almost
diametrical
to
that
which
has
been
argued
today.
the
statement
of
board
counsel
in
respect
to
the
responses
to
the
respective
questions
of
your
honors,
do
not
in
my
view
suggest
the
rule
of
that
the
board
is
now
following
nor
do
they
suggest
the
rule
that
the
law
lays
doubt.
the
inherent
interpretation
that
can
be
predicated
upon
counsel's
responses
to
the
questions
is
that
cards
are
unreliable
because
he
argues
as
we
do
that
there
are
two
ways
to
gain
recognition.
there
are
two
ways
to
impose
a
duty
to
recognize
upon
an
employer,
i.e.
the
root
by
way
of
the
election,
and
second,
the
root
by
way
of
authorization
cards,
unambiguous,
unequivocal,
signed
by
a
majority
of
the
employees
without
restrain
or
coercion.
it
was
this
rule
that
was
approved
by
congress
of
1947.
it
is
this
rule
which
has
been
approved
that
by
congress
in
1959.
it's
this
rule
which
congress,
there
are
certain
members
of
congress
has
--
have
attempted
to
change
unsuccessfully.
the
rule
as
we
see
it
is
that
when
as
in
gissel
packing
the
case
in
which
we
are
the
petitioner.
a
majority
of
the
employees
signed
clear
and
unambiguous
cards
saying,
“i
authorize
this
union
to
represent
me
in
wages
or
wages
hours
and
conditions
of
employment.”
and
when
this
majority
of
cards
are
tendered
to
the
employer,
in
one
form
or
another
and
in
the
instant
case,
they
were
tendered
to
the
employer
himself
not
to
third
party.
and
they
say,
“here
are
the
cards.
we
represent
the
majority.”
at
that
point
as
we
view
the
law,
the
employer
is
under
a
duty
to
recognize.
mr.
albert
gore
your
honor,
he
may
not
say
no.
i
want
an
election.
what
he
may
do
under
the
inherent
construction
of
the
act
is
to
file
for
an
election
himself
and
then
if
he
engages
in
no
conduct
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
free
election
and
election
can
be
had.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
correct
because
--
mr.
albert
gore
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
albert
gore
well,
no
it
is
not.
mr.
albert
gore
it
is
not
because
there
is
in
labor
relations,
the
tremendous
important
factor
of
time
--
mr.
albert
gore
oh,
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
if
the
employer
files
a
petition
because
the
one
amendment
in
1947
that
has
some
relevance
to
this
case.
was
the
amendment
in
section
9
(c)
(1)
(d)
and
the
way
this
came
up
was
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
fact
that
a
union
may
come
to
an
employer
and
demand
recognition,
and
the
employer
was
without
any
resource
to
do
anything.
unless
the
union
itself
petitioned
that
the
employer
they
said
was
on
the
--
had
to
arrive
between
so
(inaudible)
this
so
--
of
violating
8
(a)
(2)
that
is
recognizing
the
union
when
indeed
it
may
not
represent
the
majority
and
for
evidence
of
violating
8
(a)
(5)
where
they
did
represent
the
majority.
mr.
albert
gore
to
get
him
--
if
i
may
complete
my
answer
your
honor.
to
get
him
off
--
mr.
albert
gore
pardon?
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
to
get
him
off
of
that
--
to
get
him
off
of
that
congress
gave
the
employer
the
right
to
file
the
petition,
and
when
that
petition
is
filed,
that
petition
is
process
by
the
board.
so,
he
can
have
as
an
election
and
he
can't
have
a
forthwith.
mr.
albert
gore
your
honor,
at
the
time
that
he
files
his
petition,
he
is
not
under
a
duty
to
bargain.
mr.
albert
gore
because
that
is
the
one
exception
that
has
been
constructed
into
the
act
by
congress.
mr.
albert
gore
the
only
time
--
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
correct.
now
--
mr.
albert
gore
oh!
the
difference
is
vast.
the
difference
is
vast
because
under
the
administrative
rules
of
the
board,
when
the
employer
files
the
petition,
delays
are
not
available
to
him
like
they
are
when
the
union
files
a
petition.
he
can
not
--
he
comes
in
and
he
must
state
what
the
appropriate
unit
is.
he
must
state
what
his
position
is
in
respect
to
illegibility.
he
must
--
he
must
take
his
position
that
all
these
methods
and
at
that
point
the
union
can
say,
“yes,
we
agree.”
and
immediately
you
have
no
pass.
whereas,
when
the
employer
sits
on
hands
and
says,
“you
file
the
petition.
whatever
you
say
in
your
petition
we're
going
to
disagree
with.
we're
going
to
raise
an
objection
be
it
frivolous
or
not
on
the
appropriateness
of
the
unit.”
you
say
who
are
the
supervisors
will
object
to
who
you
say
the
supervisors
are.
and
under
those
circumstances,
under
the
rules
of
the
board
in
a
no
issue
case
--
in
a
no
issue
case,
an
employer
has
at
least
45
days
in
a
no
issue
case
to
go
to
an
election
and
in
my
experience
we
had
have
cases
with
petitions
filed
that
have
gone
beyond
the
year
from
the
time
of
the
filing
of
petition
before
an
election
is
held.
mr.
albert
gore
your
honor,
that
is
correct
with
one
clarification.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
his
position,
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
but
the
difference
as
you
stated
seems
small
indeed
they
are
--
apart.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
i
have
the
red
light.
mr.
albert
gore
alright.
i'd
like
to
complete
my
answer
to
judge
fortas'
question.
perhaps
i
was
a
bit
presumptuous
to
suggest
what
the
board's
position
is
as
of
today.
my
--
i
have
suggested
--now,
what
my
views
of
the
board's
decisions
might
be
and
what
their
position
has
been
unquestionably
mr.
manoli
is
in
a
better
position
to
suggest
what
the
board's
position
is
as
of
today
than
i.
and
then,
if
the
presumption
that
i
--
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
well,
i
think
--
yesterday's
position
i
thought
i
understood.
mr.
albert
gore
well,
the
aaron
brothers
case
that
mr.
manoli
suggested
articulates
a
view
that
an
employer
may
refuse
to
recognize
under
certain
circumstances
when
there
are
no
unfair
labor
practices.
it
also
articulates
the
view
that
the
employer
is
--
has
a
duty
to
bargain
impose
upon
him
--
mr.
albert
gore
--
even
--
yes
--
even
when
there
are
no
unfair
labor
practices.
mr.
albert
gore
the
aaron
brothers
case
does
not
sustain
a
--
as
i
understand
it,
i
should
say
your
honor,
does
not
sustain
the
view
that
an
employer
can't
--
can
refuse
to
recognized
blatantly.
the
union
which
has
been
designated
by
the
employees
merely
because
he
says,
he
doesn't
like
cards.
i
don't
think
that
that
suggested
in
the
aaron
brothers
case.
indeed
if
the
board
takes
that
position,
it
is
my
view
that
this
is
clearly
contrary
to
the
law.
now,
i
think
the
mistake
that
is
made
is
that
somewhere
along
the
line,
the
board
has
forgotten
that
we're
talking
about
employees'
rights.
this
court
suggested
that
an
employer
may
have
a
duty
to
bargain
imposed
upon
him
by
authorization
cards
in
the
arkansas
flooring
case.
but
when
let's
farther
actually
in
the
international
ladies
garments
workers
union
against
the
nlrb,
which
i
generally
refer
to
as
the
bernard
olton
case.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
questioned
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(2).
there
the
employer
had
recognized
a
union
on
the
basis
of
authorization
cards
without
checking
the
cards
believing
that
there
was
a
majority.
this
court
and
oh,
i
should
add
and
there
was
no
question
that
case.
none
whatsoever
but
that
the
employer
was
in
good
faith
in
recognizing
the
union.
this
court
held
that
good
faith
did
not
satisfy
prohibited
conduct.
this
court
said
that
the
employees'
rights
were
paramount.
this
court
said
that
the
employer
has
a
duty
when
cards
are
submitted
to
it
--
to
countercheck
the
cards
against
payroll.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
correct.
and
if
it
does
not
it
is
violated
the
law.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
oh,
yes.
it
may
check
the
cards.
mr.
albert
gore
ever
since
the
cards
and
finds
that
there
is
a
majority
that
recognizes.
mr.
albert
gore
if
it
checks
the
cards
and
finds
there
is
no
majority,
it
shall
not
recognize.
mr.
albert
gore
if
there
is
a
question
about
the
--
if
there
is
a
question
about
the
authenticity
of
the
signature.
however,
i
would
suggest
your
honor
that
the
employer
has
within
his
means
sufficient
basis
to
check
the
authenticity
of
the
signatures
without
going
to
the
employers.
mr.
albert
gore
where
with
no
w-2
forms
and
many
other
things
that
they
have.
and
if
then
if
there
still
remains
the
question,
there's
no
--
he
has
the
right
to
ask
the
employees.
mr.
albert
gore
the
employer
is
in
good
shape
if
he
does
not
engage
in
other
conduct
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
free
choice
of
the
employees.
this
was
an
exception
in
this
multi-facetted
act
that
was
imposed
by
mr.
(inaudible)
--
mr.
albert
gore
and
does
work
with
fire
--
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
gore
if
he
goes
forward
and
files
for
an
election
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
representation
procedures
of
the
nlrb
are
expedited.
he
does
not
have
within
his
power
to
control
delay
under
those
circumstances
of
free
choice
of
the
employees,
assuming
again
that
he
does
not
engage
inconsistent
conduct
thereafter.
mr.
albert
gore
no.
mr.
albert
gore
in
fortiori.
mr.
albert
gore
rights
under
that
8
(c)
are
protected
at
all
times.
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
i
don't
know
that
i
would
accept
the
statement
that
you've
made
a
mistake
but
i
think
that
he
would
have
a
right
to
tell
the
employees
that
you
have
a
right
to
freely
to
choose
in
the
election.
then
you
are
not
required
to
vote
in
accordance
with
the
way
you
signed
cards.
mr.
albert
gore
oh,
he
would
have
a
right
to
express
his
views
--
mr.
albert
gore
--
again
so
that
they
do
not
contain
within
the
veiled
threats
or
promises
of
benefit
which
would
affect
the
employees
free
choice.
mr.
albert
gore
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
correct.
now,
i
should
add
that
this
is
been
the
view
of
the
fourth
circuit
before
logan
packing
and
it
was
expressed
in
the
florence
printing
company
case
an
overnight
express.
mr.
albert
gore
correct.
mr.
albert
gore
i
understand
that
could
be
the
position
of
the
board,
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
well,
of
course
mr.
manoli
i
should
say.
mr.
albert
gore
i
understand
that
is
mr.
manoli's
position
that
there
is
not
a
requirement
on
the
employer
to
file
a
petition
under
section
9
(c)
(1)
(b)
in
order
to
avoid
a
refusal
to
recognize.
mr.
albert
gore
this
case
--
mr.
albert
gore
this
case
in
gissel
packing
case,
the
board
accentuated
the
fact
and
rely
the
great
measure
upon
the
fact
that
the
employer
did
not
file
a
petition
--
our
petition
under
section
9
(c)
(1)
(b).
i
should
however
add
that
this
case
presents
an
addition
numerous
unfair
labor
practices
engaged
in
by
the
employer
including
this
charges
which
were
obviously
inconsistent
with
the
--
a
desire
to
give
the
employees
a
free
choice.
but
in
this
case,
they
specifically
talked
about
the
failure
of
the
employer
to
file
a
9
(c)
(1)
(b)
petition.
mr.
albert
gore
pardon?
mr.
albert
gore
well,
they
said
--
mr.
albert
gore
they
said
that
its
failure
to
do
this
showed
that
he
was
not
in
good
faith.
is
the
position
that
the
board
took.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
the
failure
to
file
a
9
(c)
(1)
(b)
petition
was
an
act
of
not
in
good
faith.
now
here,
of
course
is
where
we
differ
from
the
board
again
and
that
we
don't
think
that
good
faith
is
relevant.
mr.
albert
gore
so
the
question
of
a
duty
to
recognize.
mr.
albert
gore
that
of
--
he
has
the
right
to
file
for
an
election.
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
gore
i
think
he
should
but
he
does
not
your
honor
and
he
does
not
because
he
gains
time
by
not
filing.
he
gains
time
to
engage
in
all
kinds
of
conduct
that
if
--
a
conduct
which
can
be
viewed
as
being
illegal
and
conduct
which
we
never
learned
about.
mr.
albert
gore
i
think
it's
crucial
to
find
that
when
the
employer
does
not
file
such
a
petition
on
the
mere
tender
of
cards,
the
majority
cards,
the
employer
has
violated
his
duty
and
has
refused
to
recognize
and
thereby
has
violated
the
employee's
rights
in
designating
their
bargaining
representative.
mr.
albert
gore
by
filing
a
petition
on
its
own.
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
apparently.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
correct.
indeed
the
--
it
was
that
aspect
of
the
case
that
i
intended
--
originally
intended
to
address
my
attention
to
the
court.
mr.
albert
gore
thank
you.
if
you'll
excuse
me
i
wish
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal
for
issue.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
i
just
have
a
few
brief
comments
i
hope.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
i
think
there
are
at
least
one
if
not
two
bills
in
the
harper,
one
but
--
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
oh,
no.
no
--
no.
i
mean,
in
one
case
the
pending
bill
would
disallow
them
entirely,
yes.
the
(inaudible)
bill
would
not
disallow
them
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
albert
gore
i'll
give
you
a
rundown
on
the
--
mr.
albert
gore
no.
it
would
they
would
honor
it
--
it
would
honor
authorization
cards.
mr.
albert
gore
and
it
would
provide
for
an
immediate
election,
a
forthwith
election
if
the
employer
filed
a
petition
and
did
not
engage
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
albert
gore
no!
oh,
i
should
hope
not.
mr.
albert
gore
i
think
first
that
that's
a
difficult
thing
to
do
in
an
abstract
way.
unquestionably
in
our
case
taking
the
gissel
packing
case
where
you
had
men
discharged
for
union
activities.
that
vitiates
the
right
for
free
election.
we
have
threats
of
discharge
that
vitiates
the
right
for
free
election.
we
have
threats
of
plant
shutdown
or
abandonment
if
the
union
comes
in.
that
vitiates
the
right
to
a
free
election.
i
think
these
are
all
things
that
we
have
in
the
gissel
case
so
that
as
far
as
our
situation
is
concerned,
i
have
no
question
that
under
any
rule,
be
it
the
rule
adopted
by
the
board
or
suggested
by
the
board
--
mr.
albert
gore
i
would
say
--
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
quite
right.
it's
a
matter
of
fact
if
--
in
our
brief,
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
are
many
activities
engaged
in
by
employers
that
are
not
unfair
labor
practices
that
still
affect
and
vitiate
the
free
election.
unfortunately,
the
law
cannot
be
written
which
will
be
able
to
take
care
of
all
these
things
because
of
the
position
of
the
employee
vis-à-vis
the
employer,
the
life
and
death
aspect
of
the
employer
on
the
employee.
mr.
albert
gore
no,
your
honor.
your
honor,
i
suggest
that
the
law
is
that
good
faith
doubt
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
that
the
obligation
to
bargain
is
written
into
the
law
by
congress
arises
from
the
presentation
of
a
majority
of
the
cards
in
a
refusal
to
recognize
thereby
brings
in
the
obligation
to
bargain.
and
in
thereby
--
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
right.
that
is
the
--
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
under
those
circumstances
it
is
when
the
employer
engages
in
unfair
labor
practices
which
make
a
free
election
improbable.
now,
i
would
want
to
direct
my
attention
very
briefly
to
the
comments
of
mr.
jenkins.
the
--
there
were
some
arguments,
the
horrors
of
the
record
in
respect
to
certain
other
cases,
and
in
respect
to
what
happens
to
petitions.
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court
from
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
sehon
stevenson
case
which
was
called
to
your
attention
and
that
relates
to
the
petition,
it
says
as
follows.
mr.
albert
gore
thank
you.
mr.
albert
gore
the
employers'
petition
for
an
election
was
denied
because
of
the
pendency
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
a
hearing
held
on
those
charges
resulted
in
findings
of
violations
of
sections
8
(a)
(1),
(3),
and
(5),
and
this
is
indeed
what
the
fact
is.
the
board
will
set
aside
the
petition
either
it
be
a
union
petition
or
an
employer
petition,
if
the
charges
are
valid
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
charges
are
not
valid,
the
charges
are
dismissed
and
the
board
goes
forward
with
the
election.
and
it's
as
simple
as
that.
mr.
albert
gore
it
could
be.
as
a
matter
fact,
the
petition
under
board
rules
is
in
some
90
to
95%
of
the
cases
held
in
suspension.
there
are
a
few
unusual
cases
and
the
terminals
is
one,
mars
incorporation
is
another,
where
the
board
has
gone
forward
in
spite
of
the
existence
of
unfair
labor
practices
charges.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
they
kept
going
forward
to
make
it
clear
they've
gone
forward
with
the
processing
of
the
representation
case
which
they
normally
hold
up
and
i
do
not
recall
a
case
where
they
actually
held
the
election.
i
think
they
wait
until
the
charges
are
resolved
one
way
or
the
other
before
the
election
is
held.
but
it
is
--
let
me
point
out.
in
90
to
95%
of
the
cases,
the
processing
of
the
charges
of
that
of
the
petition
is
held
up
pending
the
processing
of
the
charges.
now,
i
think
that
we
ought
to
note
that
in
gissel
packing
and
i
think
in
heck's,
i
know
less
about
general
steel
products,
the
cases
involved
serious
and
egregious
unfair
labor
practices
engaged
simultaneously
with
the
request
to
bargain
and
the
tender
of
cards.
in
gissel
packing,
several
months
before
the
union
tendered
the
cards
but
when
the
company
knew
the
union
was
on
the
scene,
the
company
threatened
the
employees
with
discharge.
if
it
found
that
they
had
talked
to
union
agents.
this
threat
of
discharge
continued
from
before
the
organizational
activity
began
and
continued
from
its
inception
to
beyond
the
point
when
the
demand
was
made
indeed
it.
there
was
a
crescendo
which
followed
the
demand
of
the
employer
of
the
demand
of
the
union.
i
would
like
to
end
by
saying
one
thing.
it's
clear
that
the
purpose
of
the
law
cannot
be
to
restore
the
wrongdoing
to
as
good
a
position
as
he
would
have
occupied
before
he
engaged
in
such
serious
violations.
thank
you.
mr.
albert
gore
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
in
the
anomalous
position
of
having
to
come
to
this
court
to
argue
a
case
in
conjunction
with
the
board
with
some
slight
differences
and
now
in
the
position
of
having
to
take
the
position
almost
diametrical
to
that
which
has
been
argued
today.
the
statement
of
board
counsel
in
respect
to
the
responses
to
the
respective
questions
of
your
honors,
do
not
in
my
view
suggest
the
rule
of
that
the
board
is
now
following
nor
do
they
suggest
the
rule
that
the
law
lays
doubt.
the
inherent
interpretation
that
can
be
predicated
upon
counsel's
responses
to
the
questions
is
that
cards
are
unreliable
because
he
argues
as
we
do
that
there
are
two
ways
to
gain
recognition.
there
are
two
ways
to
impose
a
duty
to
recognize
upon
an
employer,
i.e.
the
root
by
way
of
the
election,
and
second,
the
root
by
way
of
authorization
cards,
unambiguous,
unequivocal,
signed
by
a
majority
of
the
employees
without
restrain
or
coercion.
it
was
this
rule
that
was
approved
by
congress
of
1947.
it
is
this
rule
which
has
been
approved
that
by
congress
in
1959.
it's
this
rule
which
congress,
there
are
certain
members
of
congress
has
--
have
attempted
to
change
unsuccessfully.
the
rule
as
we
see
it
is
that
when
as
in
gissel
packing
the
case
in
which
we
are
the
petitioner.
a
majority
of
the
employees
signed
clear
and
unambiguous
cards
saying,
“i
authorize
this
union
to
represent
me
in
wages
or
wages
hours
and
conditions
of
employment.”
and
when
this
majority
of
cards
are
tendered
to
the
employer,
in
one
form
or
another
and
in
the
instant
case,
they
were
tendered
to
the
employer
himself
not
to
third
party.
and
they
say,
“here
are
the
cards.
we
represent
the
majority.”
at
that
point
as
we
view
the
law,
the
employer
is
under
a
duty
to
recognize.
mr.
albert
gore
your
honor,
he
may
not
say
no.
i
want
an
election.
what
he
may
do
under
the
inherent
construction
of
the
act
is
to
file
for
an
election
himself
and
then
if
he
engages
in
no
conduct
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
free
election
and
election
can
be
had.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
correct
because
--
mr.
albert
gore
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
albert
gore
well,
no
it
is
not.
mr.
albert
gore
it
is
not
because
there
is
in
labor
relations,
the
tremendous
important
factor
of
time
--
mr.
albert
gore
oh,
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
if
the
employer
files
a
petition
because
the
one
amendment
in
1947
that
has
some
relevance
to
this
case.
was
the
amendment
in
section
9
(c)
(1)
(d)
and
the
way
this
came
up
was
that
congress
was
concerned
with
the
fact
that
a
union
may
come
to
an
employer
and
demand
recognition,
and
the
employer
was
without
any
resource
to
do
anything.
unless
the
union
itself
petitioned
that
the
employer
they
said
was
on
the
--
had
to
arrive
between
so
(inaudible)
this
so
--
of
violating
8
(a)
(2)
that
is
recognizing
the
union
when
indeed
it
may
not
represent
the
majority
and
for
evidence
of
violating
8
(a)
(5)
where
they
did
represent
the
majority.
mr.
albert
gore
to
get
him
--
if
i
may
complete
my
answer
your
honor.
to
get
him
off
--
mr.
albert
gore
pardon?
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
to
get
him
off
of
that
--
to
get
him
off
of
that
congress
gave
the
employer
the
right
to
file
the
petition,
and
when
that
petition
is
filed,
that
petition
is
process
by
the
board.
so,
he
can
have
as
an
election
and
he
can't
have
a
forthwith.
mr.
albert
gore
your
honor,
at
the
time
that
he
files
his
petition,
he
is
not
under
a
duty
to
bargain.
mr.
albert
gore
because
that
is
the
one
exception
that
has
been
constructed
into
the
act
by
congress.
mr.
albert
gore
the
only
time
--
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
correct.
now
--
mr.
albert
gore
oh!
the
difference
is
vast.
the
difference
is
vast
because
under
the
administrative
rules
of
the
board,
when
the
employer
files
the
petition,
delays
are
not
available
to
him
like
they
are
when
the
union
files
a
petition.
he
can
not
--
he
comes
in
and
he
must
state
what
the
appropriate
unit
is.
he
must
state
what
his
position
is
in
respect
to
illegibility.
he
must
--
he
must
take
his
position
that
all
these
methods
and
at
that
point
the
union
can
say,
“yes,
we
agree.”
and
immediately
you
have
no
pass.
whereas,
when
the
employer
sits
on
hands
and
says,
“you
file
the
petition.
whatever
you
say
in
your
petition
we're
going
to
disagree
with.
we're
going
to
raise
an
objection
be
it
frivolous
or
not
on
the
appropriateness
of
the
unit.”
you
say
who
are
the
supervisors
will
object
to
who
you
say
the
supervisors
are.
and
under
those
circumstances,
under
the
rules
of
the
board
in
a
no
issue
case
--
in
a
no
issue
case,
an
employer
has
at
least
45
days
in
a
no
issue
case
to
go
to
an
election
and
in
my
experience
we
had
have
cases
with
petitions
filed
that
have
gone
beyond
the
year
from
the
time
of
the
filing
of
petition
before
an
election
is
held.
mr.
albert
gore
your
honor,
that
is
correct
with
one
clarification.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
his
position,
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
but
the
difference
as
you
stated
seems
small
indeed
they
are
--
apart.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
i
have
the
red
light.
mr.
albert
gore
alright.
i'd
like
to
complete
my
answer
to
judge
fortas'
question.
perhaps
i
was
a
bit
presumptuous
to
suggest
what
the
board's
position
is
as
of
today.
my
--
i
have
suggested
--now,
what
my
views
of
the
board's
decisions
might
be
and
what
their
position
has
been
unquestionably
mr.
manoli
is
in
a
better
position
to
suggest
what
the
board's
position
is
as
of
today
than
i.
and
then,
if
the
presumption
that
i
--
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
well,
i
think
--
yesterday's
position
i
thought
i
understood.
mr.
albert
gore
well,
the
aaron
brothers
case
that
mr.
manoli
suggested
articulates
a
view
that
an
employer
may
refuse
to
recognize
under
certain
circumstances
when
there
are
no
unfair
labor
practices.
it
also
articulates
the
view
that
the
employer
is
--
has
a
duty
to
bargain
impose
upon
him
--
mr.
albert
gore
--
even
--
yes
--
even
when
there
are
no
unfair
labor
practices.
mr.
albert
gore
the
aaron
brothers
case
does
not
sustain
a
--
as
i
understand
it,
i
should
say
your
honor,
does
not
sustain
the
view
that
an
employer
can't
--
can
refuse
to
recognized
blatantly.
the
union
which
has
been
designated
by
the
employees
merely
because
he
says,
he
doesn't
like
cards.
i
don't
think
that
that
suggested
in
the
aaron
brothers
case.
indeed
if
the
board
takes
that
position,
it
is
my
view
that
this
is
clearly
contrary
to
the
law.
now,
i
think
the
mistake
that
is
made
is
that
somewhere
along
the
line,
the
board
has
forgotten
that
we're
talking
about
employees'
rights.
this
court
suggested
that
an
employer
may
have
a
duty
to
bargain
imposed
upon
him
by
authorization
cards
in
the
arkansas
flooring
case.
but
when
let's
farther
actually
in
the
international
ladies
garments
workers
union
against
the
nlrb,
which
i
generally
refer
to
as
the
bernard
olton
case.
in
that
case,
there
was
a
questioned
violation
of
section
8
(a)
(2).
there
the
employer
had
recognized
a
union
on
the
basis
of
authorization
cards
without
checking
the
cards
believing
that
there
was
a
majority.
this
court
and
oh,
i
should
add
and
there
was
no
question
that
case.
none
whatsoever
but
that
the
employer
was
in
good
faith
in
recognizing
the
union.
this
court
held
that
good
faith
did
not
satisfy
prohibited
conduct.
this
court
said
that
the
employees'
rights
were
paramount.
this
court
said
that
the
employer
has
a
duty
when
cards
are
submitted
to
it
--
to
countercheck
the
cards
against
payroll.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
correct.
and
if
it
does
not
it
is
violated
the
law.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
oh,
yes.
it
may
check
the
cards.
mr.
albert
gore
ever
since
the
cards
and
finds
that
there
is
a
majority
that
recognizes.
mr.
albert
gore
if
it
checks
the
cards
and
finds
there
is
no
majority,
it
shall
not
recognize.
mr.
albert
gore
if
there
is
a
question
about
the
--
if
there
is
a
question
about
the
authenticity
of
the
signature.
however,
i
would
suggest
your
honor
that
the
employer
has
within
his
means
sufficient
basis
to
check
the
authenticity
of
the
signatures
without
going
to
the
employers.
mr.
albert
gore
where
with
no
w-2
forms
and
many
other
things
that
they
have.
and
if
then
if
there
still
remains
the
question,
there's
no
--
he
has
the
right
to
ask
the
employees.
mr.
albert
gore
the
employer
is
in
good
shape
if
he
does
not
engage
in
other
conduct
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
free
choice
of
the
employees.
this
was
an
exception
in
this
multi-facetted
act
that
was
imposed
by
mr.
(inaudible)
--
mr.
albert
gore
and
does
work
with
fire
--
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
gore
if
he
goes
forward
and
files
for
an
election
and
under
those
circumstances,
the
representation
procedures
of
the
nlrb
are
expedited.
he
does
not
have
within
his
power
to
control
delay
under
those
circumstances
of
free
choice
of
the
employees,
assuming
again
that
he
does
not
engage
inconsistent
conduct
thereafter.
mr.
albert
gore
no.
mr.
albert
gore
in
fortiori.
mr.
albert
gore
rights
under
that
8
(c)
are
protected
at
all
times.
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
i
don't
know
that
i
would
accept
the
statement
that
you've
made
a
mistake
but
i
think
that
he
would
have
a
right
to
tell
the
employees
that
you
have
a
right
to
freely
to
choose
in
the
election.
then
you
are
not
required
to
vote
in
accordance
with
the
way
you
signed
cards.
mr.
albert
gore
oh,
he
would
have
a
right
to
express
his
views
--
mr.
albert
gore
--
again
so
that
they
do
not
contain
within
the
veiled
threats
or
promises
of
benefit
which
would
affect
the
employees
free
choice.
mr.
albert
gore
yes,
sir.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
correct.
now,
i
should
add
that
this
is
been
the
view
of
the
fourth
circuit
before
logan
packing
and
it
was
expressed
in
the
florence
printing
company
case
an
overnight
express.
mr.
albert
gore
correct.
mr.
albert
gore
i
understand
that
could
be
the
position
of
the
board,
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
well,
of
course
mr.
manoli
i
should
say.
mr.
albert
gore
i
understand
that
is
mr.
manoli's
position
that
there
is
not
a
requirement
on
the
employer
to
file
a
petition
under
section
9
(c)
(1)
(b)
in
order
to
avoid
a
refusal
to
recognize.
mr.
albert
gore
this
case
--
mr.
albert
gore
this
case
in
gissel
packing
case,
the
board
accentuated
the
fact
and
rely
the
great
measure
upon
the
fact
that
the
employer
did
not
file
a
petition
--
our
petition
under
section
9
(c)
(1)
(b).
i
should
however
add
that
this
case
presents
an
addition
numerous
unfair
labor
practices
engaged
in
by
the
employer
including
this
charges
which
were
obviously
inconsistent
with
the
--
a
desire
to
give
the
employees
a
free
choice.
but
in
this
case,
they
specifically
talked
about
the
failure
of
the
employer
to
file
a
9
(c)
(1)
(b)
petition.
mr.
albert
gore
pardon?
mr.
albert
gore
well,
they
said
--
mr.
albert
gore
they
said
that
its
failure
to
do
this
showed
that
he
was
not
in
good
faith.
is
the
position
that
the
board
took.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
the
failure
to
file
a
9
(c)
(1)
(b)
petition
was
an
act
of
not
in
good
faith.
now
here,
of
course
is
where
we
differ
from
the
board
again
and
that
we
don't
think
that
good
faith
is
relevant.
mr.
albert
gore
so
the
question
of
a
duty
to
recognize.
mr.
albert
gore
that
of
--
he
has
the
right
to
file
for
an
election.
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
gore
i
think
he
should
but
he
does
not
your
honor
and
he
does
not
because
he
gains
time
by
not
filing.
he
gains
time
to
engage
in
all
kinds
of
conduct
that
if
--
a
conduct
which
can
be
viewed
as
being
illegal
and
conduct
which
we
never
learned
about.
mr.
albert
gore
i
think
it's
crucial
to
find
that
when
the
employer
does
not
file
such
a
petition
on
the
mere
tender
of
cards,
the
majority
cards,
the
employer
has
violated
his
duty
and
has
refused
to
recognize
and
thereby
has
violated
the
employee's
rights
in
designating
their
bargaining
representative.
mr.
albert
gore
by
filing
a
petition
on
its
own.
that
is
correct.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
apparently.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
correct.
indeed
the
--
it
was
that
aspect
of
the
case
that
i
intended
--
originally
intended
to
address
my
attention
to
the
court.
mr.
albert
gore
thank
you.
if
you'll
excuse
me
i
wish
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal
for
issue.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
i
just
have
a
few
brief
comments
i
hope.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
i
think
there
are
at
least
one
if
not
two
bills
in
the
harper,
one
but
--
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
oh,
no.
no
--
no.
i
mean,
in
one
case
the
pending
bill
would
disallow
them
entirely,
yes.
the
(inaudible)
bill
would
not
disallow
them
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
albert
gore
i'll
give
you
a
rundown
on
the
--
mr.
albert
gore
no.
it
would
they
would
honor
it
--
it
would
honor
authorization
cards.
mr.
albert
gore
and
it
would
provide
for
an
immediate
election,
a
forthwith
election
if
the
employer
filed
a
petition
and
did
not
engage
unfair
labor
practice.
mr.
albert
gore
no!
oh,
i
should
hope
not.
mr.
albert
gore
i
think
first
that
that's
a
difficult
thing
to
do
in
an
abstract
way.
unquestionably
in
our
case
taking
the
gissel
packing
case
where
you
had
men
discharged
for
union
activities.
that
vitiates
the
right
for
free
election.
we
have
threats
of
discharge
that
vitiates
the
right
for
free
election.
we
have
threats
of
plant
shutdown
or
abandonment
if
the
union
comes
in.
that
vitiates
the
right
to
a
free
election.
i
think
these
are
all
things
that
we
have
in
the
gissel
case
so
that
as
far
as
our
situation
is
concerned,
i
have
no
question
that
under
any
rule,
be
it
the
rule
adopted
by
the
board
or
suggested
by
the
board
--
mr.
albert
gore
i
would
say
--
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
quite
right.
it's
a
matter
of
fact
if
--
in
our
brief,
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
are
many
activities
engaged
in
by
employers
that
are
not
unfair
labor
practices
that
still
affect
and
vitiate
the
free
election.
unfortunately,
the
law
cannot
be
written
which
will
be
able
to
take
care
of
all
these
things
because
of
the
position
of
the
employee
vis-à-vis
the
employer,
the
life
and
death
aspect
of
the
employer
on
the
employee.
mr.
albert
gore
no,
your
honor.
your
honor,
i
suggest
that
the
law
is
that
good
faith
doubt
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
that
the
obligation
to
bargain
is
written
into
the
law
by
congress
arises
from
the
presentation
of
a
majority
of
the
cards
in
a
refusal
to
recognize
thereby
brings
in
the
obligation
to
bargain.
and
in
thereby
--
mr.
albert
gore
that
is
right.
that
is
the
--
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
under
those
circumstances
it
is
when
the
employer
engages
in
unfair
labor
practices
which
make
a
free
election
improbable.
now,
i
would
want
to
direct
my
attention
very
briefly
to
the
comments
of
mr.
jenkins.
the
--
there
were
some
arguments,
the
horrors
of
the
record
in
respect
to
certain
other
cases,
and
in
respect
to
what
happens
to
petitions.
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court
from
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
sehon
stevenson
case
which
was
called
to
your
attention
and
that
relates
to
the
petition,
it
says
as
follows.
mr.
albert
gore
thank
you.
mr.
albert
gore
the
employers'
petition
for
an
election
was
denied
because
of
the
pendency
of
the
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
a
hearing
held
on
those
charges
resulted
in
findings
of
violations
of
sections
8
(a)
(1),
(3),
and
(5),
and
this
is
indeed
what
the
fact
is.
the
board
will
set
aside
the
petition
either
it
be
a
union
petition
or
an
employer
petition,
if
the
charges
are
valid
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
charges
are
not
valid,
the
charges
are
dismissed
and
the
board
goes
forward
with
the
election.
and
it's
as
simple
as
that.
mr.
albert
gore
it
could
be.
as
a
matter
fact,
the
petition
under
board
rules
is
in
some
90
to
95%
of
the
cases
held
in
suspension.
there
are
a
few
unusual
cases
and
the
terminals
is
one,
mars
incorporation
is
another,
where
the
board
has
gone
forward
in
spite
of
the
existence
of
unfair
labor
practices
charges.
mr.
albert
gore
yes.
mr.
albert
gore
they
kept
going
forward
to
make
it
clear
they've
gone
forward
with
the
processing
of
the
representation
case
which
they
normally
hold
up
and
i
do
not
recall
a
case
where
they
actually
held
the
election.
i
think
they
wait
until
the
charges
are
resolved
one
way
or
the
other
before
the
election
is
held.
but
it
is
--
let
me
point
out.
in
90
to
95%
of
the
cases,
the
processing
of
the
charges
of
that
of
the
petition
is
held
up
pending
the
processing
of
the
charges.
now,
i
think
that
we
ought
to
note
that
in
gissel
packing
and
i
think
in
heck's,
i
know
less
about
general
steel
products,
the
cases
involved
serious
and
egregious
unfair
labor
practices
engaged
simultaneously
with
the
request
to
bargain
and
the
tender
of
cards.
in
gissel
packing,
several
months
before
the
union
tendered
the
cards
but
when
the
company
knew
the
union
was
on
the
scene,
the
company
threatened
the
employees
with
discharge.
if
it
found
that
they
had
talked
to
union
agents.
this
threat
of
discharge
continued
from
before
the
organizational
activity
began
and
continued
from
its
inception
to
beyond
the
point
when
the
demand
was
made
indeed
it.
there
was
a
crescendo
which
followed
the
demand
of
the
employer
of
the
demand
of
the
union.
i
would
like
to
end
by
saying
one
thing.
it's
clear
that
the
purpose
of
the
law
cannot
be
to
restore
the
wrongdoing
to
as
good
a
position
as
he
would
have
occupied
before
he
engaged
in
such
serious
violations.
thank
you.
