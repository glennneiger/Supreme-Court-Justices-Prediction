(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
issue
is
not
here?
unknown
speaker
that's
between
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
doesn't
the
idea
of
evening
news
answered
this
question?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
show
a
dispute
as
to
the
fringe
benefits
not
as
to
whether
they
should
be
paid
but
as
to
how
they
should
be
paid.
unknown
speaker
as
i
recall,
all
they
had
to
be
done
is
to
calculate
the
hours
that
it
should
be
reflect
on
employees
work,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
did
the
arbitrator
was
left
to
get
off
a
lesson
on
the
fringe
benefit?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
say
it
has
the
option
because
the
board
issued
an
order.
the
question
is
what
does
the
order
mean
if
you
ordered
these
people
to
pay
pursuant
to
the
contract?
if
you
order
them
to
pay
pursuant
to
the
contract,
the
next
question
is
whether
that
is
to
be
determined
in
accordance
with
the
machinery
provided
by
the
contract
or
has
the
board
pro
tanto
displays
that
machinery
of
the
contract.
and
those
are
the
questions
that
are
right
here
right
now.
unknown
speaker
may
be
that's
your
answer.
may
your
answer
is
that
we
are
not
to
consider
the
question
of
how
the
amounts
to
be
computed
because
you
went
to
raise
below.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
consider
it
but
if
on
the
other
hand
you
are
giving
us
what
you
should
take
an
official
answer
from
the
board,
that
is
to
say
that
the
board
can
determine
how
these
amounts
can
be
computed,
the
board
can
determine
that
the
contract
machinery
will
be
used
or
won't
be
used.
if
that's
your
position,
the
letter
is
your
position
and
i
confess
i
have
some
problems.
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
but
let
me
answer
you.
it
takes
additional
time
here
but
let
me
see
if
i
put
it
this
way.
the
question
here
is
doest
the
board
have
power
under
the
act
to
order
the
payment
of
fringe
benefit
provided
for
in
a
contract?
the
objection
is,
as
i
understand
it,
that
would
amount
to
the
board
interpretation
and
enforcement
of
a
contract.
now,
do
you
tell
me
that
the
board
has
merely
ordered
the
payment
to
be
made
the
amounts
had
been
determined
in
accordance
with
the
contract
by
the
contract
machinery?
that
gives
this
question
more
in
particular
case.
if
on
the
other
hand,
you
tell
me
that
the
board
has
in
effect
going
to
supplant
the
machinery
provided
them
in
the
contract.
insofar
as
the
determination
of
the
amounts
all
that
it
concern
that
to
my
mind
make
give
this
legal
problem
we
have
before
is
a
very
different
case.
