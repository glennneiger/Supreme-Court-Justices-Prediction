well,
i
understand
that
originally,
they
took
the
position
that
the
respondent
did
not
design
the
contract
because
he
didn't
recognize
this
bonding?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then,
nothing
would
gone
until
this
action
went
into
the
nlrb?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then,
it
was
found
that
it
was
a
contract.
justice
thurgood

and
now,
you
shift
your
position
in
saying
that
you
want
to
operate
under
the
contract
which

are
the
same.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
fact
that

my
jurisdiction,
