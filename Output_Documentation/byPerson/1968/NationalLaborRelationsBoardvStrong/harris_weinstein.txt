mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
labor
case
which
comes
to
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
sole
issue
to
go
is
to
the
scope
of
the
remedial
powers
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
the
exact
issue
was
this,
once
the
board
has
found
an
unfair
refusal
to
execute
a
labor
contract
made
include
in
its
order
a
provision
that
requires
the
respondent
to
pay
past
fringe
benefits
that
would
have
been
required
to
pay,
if
it
had
executed
the
contract
at
the
time
we
fashion.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
no,
the
board
may
not
do
this.
it
may
not
direct
payments
required
by
a
collective
agreement
and
that
the
remedy
is
not
a
board
order
but
it
must
be
by
way
of
suit
under
section
301
of
the
act.
and
this,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
petition
and
in
our
brief
is
in
conflict
with
the
views
expressed
in
several
other
circumstance.
the
case
arose
in
this
way,
the
respondent
joseph
strong
is
in
a
roofing
business
in
los
angeles.
in
1963,
when
this
critical
series
of
begun,
he
was
as
he
had
been
for
many
years
before
a
member
of
a
contractor's
association
that
was
a
multi-employer
bargaining
unit.
he
was
contractually
obligated
to
abide
by
the
contracts
of
the
association
negotiated
with
unions
including
one
that
represented
his
employees.
he
will
also
as
obligated
if
he
was
going
to
stroll.
to
do
so,
at
least
60
days
before
the
termination
of
the
contract
period.
the
old
contract,
that
is
the
one
that's
owed
in
the
context
of
this
case,
was
due
to
expire
in
the
middle
of
august
of
1963.
negotiations
took
place
during
the
first
half
of
that
year
and
on
august
14,
the
union
and
the
contractors
association
reached
agreement
on
a
new
four
year
contract
to
take
the
effect
the
next
day,
august
15.
a
year
and
a
half
before
in
1962,
respondent
had
written
a
letter
stating
his
desire
to
terminate
the
non-agreement
and
nothing
came
about.
then
on
august
20
in
1963,
a
few
days
after
the
new
agreement
was
reached,
he
sent
a
letter
to
the
joint
industry
union
grievance
board,
expressing
a
wish
to
become
a
non
--
to
withdraw
to
become
a
nonunion
member,
to
terminate
the
new
contract
as
to
him.
although
the
association,
the
contractors
association
changed
its
status
on
its
books
and
refunded
a
security
deposit
and
terminated
the
bond
that
was
suppose
to
secure
his
payment
of
fringe
benefits.
the
union
on
three
occasions
approached
him,
beginning
in
october
63
and
then
again
in
november
and
fall
in
april
and
asked
him
to
sign
the
contract
which
he
refused
to
do.
mr.
harris
weinstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
court
pleases,
as
just
before
the
recess,
i've
mentioned
that
on
three
occasions
between
october
1963
and
april
1964,
the
union
asked
that
respondent
to
execute
the
bargaining
agreement
and
each
time,
he
refused.
on
the
basis
of
these
facts,
the
union
filed
unfair
labor
practice
charges
in
the
board
upheld
and
ruled
that
respondent
had
not
under
his
duty
to
bargain.
on
a
petition
for
enforcement,
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
substantive
findings
and
last
january,
this
court
denied
respondents
petition
for
certiorari.
so
as
the
case
stands,
respondent
has
been
finally
adjudicated
to
have
unfairly
refused
to
bargain
and
the
controversy
goes
to
the
boards
order.
that
order
is
set
out
on
pages
120
and
121
of
the
record.
it
has
in
paragraph
1
some
cease
and
desist
directions
which
are
not
in
controversy.
it
directs
in
paragraph
2(a)
that
respondent
execute
and
honor
the
agreement
that
was
negotiated
and
that
is
not
in
controversy.
the
issue
goes
to
paragraph
2(b)
of
the
order.
mr.
harris
weinstein
b,
after
a,
which
directs
that
respondent
pay
to
the
appropriate
source
any
fringe
benefits
provided
for
in
the
above-described
contract.
and
also
an
issue
would
be
a
parallel
part
of
the
notice
to
employees
that
respondent
was
told
to
oppose
and
this
is
on
page
122,
the
third
indented
paragraph
and
that
would
have
set
in
the
notice,
we
will
make
hold
the
appropriate
sources
for
any
unpaid
fringe
benefits
provided
in
the
above
contract.
the
court
of
appeals
in
holding
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
these
are
set
out
in
the
contract,
agreed
in
the
contract
itself
which
are
on
the
record,
mr.
justice
stewart
-
i
think
on
page
66
-
and
it
sets
up
several
funds
to
which
payments
are
to
be
made,
there
is
a
health
and
welfare
trust,
there's
an
apprentice
trust,
there
are
two
other
funds
then
below,
there
is
a
roofer's
fund.
and
these
are
amounts
measured
by
the
hour
of
each
employee
that
were
supposed
to
be
paid
to
provide
for
a
variety
of
fringe
benefits.
the
basic
one
is
the
health
and
welfare
fund
and
the
roofers
fund.
and
that
the
order,
i
am
talking
to
the
appropriate
sources
to
[coughing]
mean
to
whomever
each
particular
item
would
have
been
paid
if
the
contract
had
been
executed
at
the
time
we
fashioned.
mr.
harris
weinstein
in
finding
this
paragraph
of
the
order
was
beyond
the
board's
power.
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
was,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
unfair
labor
practice
was
not
the
failure
to
pay
these
amounts
but
was
instead
just
a
refusal
to
execute
the
contract.
and
it
said
that
the
order
was,
and
i'm
quoting
from
their
opinion,
an
order
to
respondent
to
carry
out
provisions
of
the
contract
and
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
board.
so
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
if
an
order
of
the
board
directs
payment
of
a
benefit
required
by
a
contract,
whatever
else
the
circumstance
is
the
board
doesn't
have
power
to
do
that.
the
only
recourse
to
the
union
or
its
memberships
would
be
a
suit
against
the
employer
under
section
301
of
the
act.
now,
at
the
time
that
we
filed
our
briefs
here,
i
believe
there
had
been
eleven
cases
on
this
or
related
matters
and
this
was
the
only
one
that
found
the
board
without
power.
there
are
since
been
another
case
that
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
in
the
fourth
circuit.
it
is
called
nlrb
against
the
beverage
heir
company.
and
it
is
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
air,
beverages
and
drink
and
air
company
and
it's
reported
at
the
69
labor
relations
reference
manual
at
page
2369.
and
like
several
other
cases
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
all
the
other
cases
but
this
one,
it
allows
enforcement
of
an
order
such
as
we
have
before
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
harris
weinstein
2369,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
enforcing
a
decision
of
the
board.
mr.
harris
weinstein
fourth,
sir.
and
then
the
board,
part
of
the
order
that
is
discussed
and
that
is
enforced
is
essentially
similar
to
paragraph
2
(b)
of
the
order
here.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
presume
so.
now
in
the
final
analysis,
the
resolution
of
this
case
depends
on
the
construction
as
placed
upon
section
10
(c)
of
the
act.
that
tells
the
board
what
to
do
once
it
finds
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
as
the
source
of
the
boards
remedial
authority.
now,
essentially,
that
tells
the
board
to
do
two
things,
first,
to
enter
a
cease
and
desist
order
which
it
did
here;
and
then,
it
tells
the
board
to
take
such
affirmative
action
including
reinstatement
of
employees
with
or
without
back
pay
as
well
effectuate
the
policies
of
this
act.
a
long
line
of
cases,
going
back
to
the
inception
of
the
wagner
act,
this
court
has
looked
at
this
language
and
it
is
considered
what
it
allows
the
board
to
do
and
perhaps
the
most
recent
summary
of
the
authorities
is
in
the
five
aboard
decision
in
379
u.s.
but
the
thrust
of
it
is
simple.
the
board
is
directed
to
take
affirmative
action
and
that
action
should
be
whatever
is
needed
to
restore
things
to
what
they
would
have
been
without
the
unfair
labor
practice.
and
that
serves
two
functions:
first,
it
restores
the
bargaining
process.
it
let's
operates
it
operate
as
it
would
have
without
the
unfair
activity;
second,
it
takes
the
profit
out
of
unlawfulness.
it
takes
away
any
hope
of
gain
through
refusing
to
bargain.
it
deters
the
particular
respondent
and
other
people
from
illegal
conduct
and
encourages
them
to
voluntarily
perform
their
duties
under
the
act.
now,
we
would
think
that
under
this
analysis,
there's
extremely
strong
case
for
our
decision
without
looking
further.
the
board
has
an
affirmative
duty
to
provide
relief,
to
restore
the
status
quo
ante
the
violation.
the
cases,
the
11
unsolved
cases
that
have
been
reported
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
subject
show
that
basically
there
are
two
patterns.
either
as
in
this
case,
the
employer
has
refused
to
execute
a
contract
that
has
been
negotiated
by
him
or
on
his
behalf
and
the
board,
among
other
things,
says
to
the
employer,
pay
whatever
you
would
have
had
to
pay
if
you
would
executed
the
contract
in
a
timely
fashion.
mr.
harris
weinstein
as
of
this
moment,
yes.
i
think
this
was
litigated
all
through
petitions.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
it
is
refusing
to
sign
the
contract.
there
was
no
--
the
other
line
of
cases
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
refusing
to
sign
a
contract?
the
duty
to
bargain,
i
think,
has
been
interpreted
as
requiring
that
ones
a
contract
is
bargained
for
and
all
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
i
think
the
authorities
are
set
out
in
the
examiner's
opinion
here
which
the
board
accepted.
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
is
not.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
think
that
there's
ever
been
any
dispute
about
the
duty
to
sign
(voice
overlap).
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
mr.
justice
white
asked
me
if
it
was
conceded
here
that
there
had
been
an
unfair
labor
practice
which
i
took
to
mean
is
the
respondent
is
still
arguing
that
he
didn't
violate
the
act.
mr.
harris
weinstein
his
defenses
were
first
that
this
unfair
practice
was
not
thought
within
first
month
of
the
violation
of
the
act;
that
the
union,
by
its
conduct,
had
waived
it's
right
to
have
mr.
strong
sign
the
agreement.
i
think
those
are
basically
the
issues
that
we
presented
in
this
petition
for
certiorari
a
year
ago
and
that
the
refused
(voice
overlap).
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan,
last
january.
mr.
harris
weinstein
now,
we
had
our
time
for
petitioning.
it
was
not
the
same
as
the
respondents
because
we
had
filed
the
petition
for
rehearing
on
bank
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
our
petition
for
certiorari
was,
therefore,
not
do
until,
i
believe,
that
april
and
that's
when
we
filed
it.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
imagine
that
might
be
depending
on
the
circumstances,
mr.
justice
white.
for
example,
one
of
the
case
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
and
what
is
the
consequence
of
that?
the
other
line
of
cases,
i
think,
falls
on
the
category
of
just
refusing
to
pay
after
the
contract
is
executed.
for
example,
in
the
stam
(ph)
case,
which
i
think
was
in
the
seventh
circuit,
the
employer
had
unilaterally
amended
the
health
program
and
it
refused
to
bargain
over.
and
there,
the
amendment
itself
to
the
health
program,
the
unilateral
amendment
without
bargain
was
both
a
violation
of
the
contract
and
a
refusal
to
bargain.
but
in
either
instance
whether
the
case
is
like
that
one
or
this
one,
the
board
has
entered
in
order
requiring
that
the
employees
be
made
whole
for
what
they
have
been
deprived
of.
certainly,
in
this
case
while
the
payment
--
a
mere
refusal
to
pay
fringe
benefits
might
not
have
been
an
unfair
labor
practice
if
the
contract
had
been
sagged.
the
fact
that
this
weren't
paid
is
a
consequence
of
the
unfair
practice.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
it's
certainly
an
unfair
practice
to
refuse
to
sign.
now
whether
refusal
to
pay
is
itself
an
unfair
practice
depends.
for
example,
if
he
hadn't
paid
because
he
was
bankrupt.
i
imagine
that
wouldn't
be
an
unfair
practice
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
oh!
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
would
fall
apart
because
they
were
alive
and
part
on
the
fact
that
that
in
itself
on
this
record
wasn't
the
unfair
practice
that
was
found.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
have
some
problem
with
that.
certainly
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
it's
the
implication
of
what
they
said.
they
didn't
spell
that
out
that
way.
i
suppose
before
the
boards
action
here,
a
suit
had
been
brought
under
301.
i
assume
that
defense
would
have
been
there's
no
contract.
now,
if
the
courts
have
found
there
was
a
contract,
then
i
imagine
of
--
they
could
have
directed
payment
of
the
fringe
benefits.
now,
what
the
respondent
is
saying
here
is
there
must
be
a
two-step
proceeding.
first,
you
go
to
the
board
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
contract.
if
the
board
says
there
was
a
contract
and
orders
its
execution,
well
that
execution
is
retroactively
valid
but
the
board
can't
order
the
payment
of
the
benefits
then
you
got
to
go
to
arbitration
or
to
a
301
suit.
and
it's
this
analysis
that
we
are
saying
simply
doesn't
comfort
with
what
was
wrong.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no!
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
basis
of
our
cases
is
that
there
are
concurrent
evidence.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i'm
not
sure.
i
don't
think
that
he
would
get
being
contempt
if
he
hadn't
since
the
order
is
still
subject
to
litigation.
i
don't
know
whether
he
has.
well,
the
reasons
--
the
basis
for
the
view
that
the
court
of
appeals
to
abide,
i
think
there
are
two-folds,
and
they
find
the
root
in
legislative
inaction
and
action.
one
is
that
there
is
section
301
which
confers
jurisdiction
on
the
courts.
the
other
is
that
congress
declined
to
make
breach
of
a
contract
by
itself
in
unfair
labor
practice.
it's
a
pretty
weak
reads
but
the
inference
of
the
court
of
appeals
through
is
directly
refuted
by
the
act
because
section
10
(a)
of
the
act
says
that.
the
boards
power
to
remedy
on
unfair
labor
practices
shall
not
be
affected
by
any
other
means
of
adjustment
or
prevention
that
has
been
established
by
agreement
law
or
otherwise.
and,
the
interesting
thing
is,
that
congress
don't
seem
to
get
any
thought
that
there
was
any
possibility
that
it
was
the
best
thing
the
board
of
jurisdiction
to
act
in
a
case
like
this.
it
did
express
some
concern
that
section
301
could
be
limited
to
situations
where
there
was
no
unfair
labor
practice
and
the
committee
report
recognizes
that
possibility
and
expressly
says
that
when
there
are
two
remedies
-
one
before
the
board
and
one
before
the
courts,
they
are
cumulative
and
not
mutually
exclusive.
now,
this
court
also
have
to
say
it's
not
riding
on
a
thin
slake.
if
my
count
is
correct,
this
is
the
7th
time
in
7
years
that
the
court
has
had
occasion
to
comment
on
this
particular
problem.
the
first
three
cases
involves
the
problem
that
was
predicted
by
the
congress.
are
the
courts
in
some
manner
preempted
the
one
case,
lucas
was
questioned
as
our
state
courts
preempted
of
jurisdiction
by
section
301
without
regard
to
the
board.
the
next
two
cases,
the
smith
against
evening
news
case
in
371
u.s.,
carrie
against
westinghouse
in
375
u.s,
the
question
was
whether
the
board
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
the
delegation
of
the
courts
when
there
was
both
an
unfair
practice
and
a
violation
of
contract.
now,
the
issue
wasn't
before
the
court
in
those
cases
but
in
each
of
the
opinions,
the
court
took
care
to
say
that
it
was
not
suggesting
that
the
board
was
without
jurisdiction
and
expressly
said
in
each
instance
that
there
were
dual
remedies
available.
the
next
two
cases,
were
companion
cases
in
385
of
us
reports,
c
&
c
plywood
case
and
the
acne
industrial
case
-
and
then
each
of
those,
the
contention
was
that
the
board
was
without
jurisdiction
in
matters
that
could
be
adjudicated
before
the
courts
in
a
301
suit.
and
in
each
instance,
this
argument
was
rejected.
and
then,
in
the
great
dane
case
later
in
the
same
term,
a
similar
argument
had
been
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
but
was
dropped
when
this
case
reached
this
court.
but
the
court's
opinion
again
points
out
that
the
fact
that
there
is
jurisdiction
in
the
courts
under
301
does
not
deprived
a
board
of
jurisdiction.
now,
i
suppose
that
these
cases
could
be
distinguished
from
c
&
c
plywood
and
acne
industrial
on
the
ground
that
those
cases
involve
the
subject
matter
of
the
labor
board;
in
this
case
involves
its
power
authority
where
its
subject
matter
of
jurisdiction
is
not
in
issue.
but
we
would
suggest
that
these
cases
an
easier
one
for
finding
board
jurisdiction.
in
those
instances,
the
problem
was
there
were
matters
in
dispute
that
might
have
been
resolved
or
left
through
litigation
in
the
courts.
here,
the
disputed
matters
at
least,
as
the
contentions
have
been
framed,
are
not
things
that
are
ordinarily
decided
in
the
courts
in
section
301
(6).
the
contract
has
been
used
[coughing]
simply
as
the
measure
of
the
remedy.
it's
just
the
same,
i
would
think,
that
if
the
board
in
ordering
back
pay
as
used
in
oral
rate
established
by
a
contract
in
so
many
art
today.
i
suppose
if
we
follow
through
the
court
of
appeals'
analysis
to
its
logical
conclusion,
[coughing]
the
board
can
no
longer
order
back
pay
if
the
back
pay
is
based
on
a
rate
established
in
a
contract.
there's
nothing
in
controversy
here
on
what
the
contract
means
in
terms
of
the
fringe
benefits.
they
set
out
their
numerical
--
there's
just
a
calculation
to
be
made.
and
all
the
reasons
alluded
in
this
court's
opinion
in
c
&
c
and
acne
would
seem
to
require
the
same
result
here.
for
example
in
acne,
the
court
discussed
the
difficulties
that
would
arise
from
having
two
proceedings
and
matters
of
that
sort.
there's
no
reason
to
put
the
union
or
its
members
to
a
duality
of
proceedings.
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
the
board
is
devoid
of
jurisdiction,
wants
it
to
act
to
cure
a
violation
that
it's
found.
i
think
there's
one
other
point
that
requires
brief
mention.
much
of
the
respondent's
brief
on
the
merits
is
devoted
to
an
argument
that
the
grievance
and
arbitration
provisions
of
this
particular
contract
forbid
the
board's
action.
as
i
understand
that
they
are
saying
that
whenever
there
is
an
arbitration
and
grievance
procedure,
the
board
can't
make
any
order
that
could
have
been
entered
by
an
arbitrator.
well,
first,
i
think
this
is
the
first
mention
of
arbitration
in
this
case.
i'm
familiar
with
no
request
for
arbitration
nor
suggestion
that
this
matter
could
have
been
arbitrated
and
i
would
assume
from
the
way
the
arbitration
clause
is
worded,
it's
should
question
whether
the
arbitrated
would
speak
to
the
existence
of
the
contract.
but
all
this
isn't
really
pertinent
because
i
think
the
court
again
has
disposed
of
the
contention
both
in
the
case
of
carrie
against
westinghouse
and
the
acne
industrial
case.
each
time
the
court
had
occasion
to
discuss
the
interrelationship
between
arbitration
and
the
board's
activities,
in
carrie
the
claim
was
that
the
board's
jurisdiction
excluded
arbitration;
in
acne
the
claim
was
the
presence
of
an
arbitration
clause
for
the
board
to
act
in
each
time
the
court
held
that
there
was
a
duality
of
jurisdiction
and
pointed
out
that
the
reasons
that
were
applied
in
steelworkers
trilogy
to
require
the
courts
to
defer
arbitration
didn't
apply
in
a
board
proceedings.
no
doubt
the
board
here
could
have,
if
the
matter
warranted
it
send
them
direct
arbitration.
it
could
have
deferred
to
arbitration.
but
there's
absolutely
no
reason
why
it
had
to
withhold
its
hand
and
instead
rely
on
some
other
internal
inter-party
process.
thank
you.
mr.
harris
weinstein
if,
mr.
chief
justice
of
court
pleases,
i
simply
suggest
that
all
the
arguments
that
have
been
advanced
in
this
court,
in
that
arbitration
which
were
not
advanced
before
the
labor
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
are
all
disposed
of
by
mr.
justice
douglas
as
an
opinion
for
the
court
in
carrie
against
westinghouse
where
the
court
discusses
the
considerable
length
of
the
relationship
between
arbitration
and
board
proceedings,
makes
clear
that
these
are
alternatives
available
to
the
complaining
party
and
goes
so
far
to
say
that
in
the
event
of
conflict,
the
boards
ruling
would
have
coursed
to
take
precedents.
now,
as
that
opinion
points
out,
the
board
may
and
has
in
a
variety
of
occasions
deferred
or
invoke
the
arbitration
of
a
circumstances
seems
appropriate
and
the
parties
asked
for
it
in
a
timely
and
proper
way
with
three
simple
grounds
for
doing
it.
but
that
has
to
be
done
in
a
timely
way
before
the
board.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
boards
power
and
that
is
the
only
issue
here.
the
board
can,
if
it
wishes
use
arbitration,
if
the
disputes
develops
in
calculating
what
is
due
under
this
order
here.
the
court
can,
if
it
wishes,
go
to
the
trustees
under
this
agreement.
it
can
call
them
in,
it
can
invoke
arbitration.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
board's
decision
is
that
it
has
the
option.
if
there
was
a
dispute,
the
board
would
hold
a
proceeding
to
resolve
the
dispute.
justice
powell
would
hold
the
proceeding
to
determine
whether
there's
been
an
unfair
practice.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
the
fair
answer
to
that
was
that
because
there
was
no
suggestion
before
that
anything
other
than
a
mathematical
computation
was
required.
the
board,
in
writing
its
order,
didn't
consider
whether
pursuant
to
the
contract
incorporated
submission
to
the
trustees
under
what
i
told
the
state
clause
of
the
agreement.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
that
contention
is
really
to
be
brought
in
that
there
would
so
equitable
grounds
that
would
require
a
lesser
payment
that
the
mathematical
computation
calls
for
that
the
burden
would
be
on
the
employer,
dwell
into
the
board
and
request
elaboration
of
its
order.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
board
has
the
authority
to
do
it
either
way.
and
in
this
case,
what's
been
brought
into
oral
argument
here
is
a
matter
that
was
not
brought
to
the
board
itself
in
a
timely
fashion.
i
don't
think
it
was
controverted.
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
wasn't
raised
below?
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
i
would
start
by
saying
that
because
of
the
ordinary
course
of
board
proceedings
disputes
over
computation
would
be
resolved
after
the
order
becomes
final
that
the
issue
wasn't
before
the
court.
i
would
suggest
though
that
if
the
court
would
going
to
decide
that
issue
against
the
board,
it
would
require
considerable
back
tracking
on
the
analysis
on
the
carrie
opinion
and
the
acne
opinion.
that
it
would
require
what
we
would
suggest
this
an
inconsistency
with
section
10
(a)
of
the
act
which
says
that
the
private
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
think
that
as
the
case
is
framed
and
as
--
because
of
the
arguments
had
been
made
earlier.
what
you've
stated
as
your
second
reading
of
the
issue
isn't
in
the
case.
it's
not.
i
think
that
the
--
again,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
matters
discussed
in
the
carrie
decision
which
showed
the
way,
the
board
decides
whether
to
defer
to
contract
machinery.
thank
you.
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
labor
case
which
comes
to
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
sole
issue
to
go
is
to
the
scope
of
the
remedial
powers
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
the
exact
issue
was
this,
once
the
board
has
found
an
unfair
refusal
to
execute
a
labor
contract
made
include
in
its
order
a
provision
that
requires
the
respondent
to
pay
past
fringe
benefits
that
would
have
been
required
to
pay,
if
it
had
executed
the
contract
at
the
time
we
fashion.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
no,
the
board
may
not
do
this.
it
may
not
direct
payments
required
by
a
collective
agreement
and
that
the
remedy
is
not
a
board
order
but
it
must
be
by
way
of
suit
under
section
301
of
the
act.
and
this,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
petition
and
in
our
brief
is
in
conflict
with
the
views
expressed
in
several
other
circumstance.
the
case
arose
in
this
way,
the
respondent
joseph
strong
is
in
a
roofing
business
in
los
angeles.
in
1963,
when
this
critical
series
of
begun,
he
was
as
he
had
been
for
many
years
before
a
member
of
a
contractor's
association
that
was
a
multi-employer
bargaining
unit.
he
was
contractually
obligated
to
abide
by
the
contracts
of
the
association
negotiated
with
unions
including
one
that
represented
his
employees.
he
will
also
as
obligated
if
he
was
going
to
stroll.
to
do
so,
at
least
60
days
before
the
termination
of
the
contract
period.
the
old
contract,
that
is
the
one
that's
owed
in
the
context
of
this
case,
was
due
to
expire
in
the
middle
of
august
of
1963.
negotiations
took
place
during
the
first
half
of
that
year
and
on
august
14,
the
union
and
the
contractors
association
reached
agreement
on
a
new
four
year
contract
to
take
the
effect
the
next
day,
august
15.
a
year
and
a
half
before
in
1962,
respondent
had
written
a
letter
stating
his
desire
to
terminate
the
non-agreement
and
nothing
came
about.
then
on
august
20
in
1963,
a
few
days
after
the
new
agreement
was
reached,
he
sent
a
letter
to
the
joint
industry
union
grievance
board,
expressing
a
wish
to
become
a
non
--
to
withdraw
to
become
a
nonunion
member,
to
terminate
the
new
contract
as
to
him.
although
the
association,
the
contractors
association
changed
its
status
on
its
books
and
refunded
a
security
deposit
and
terminated
the
bond
that
was
suppose
to
secure
his
payment
of
fringe
benefits.
the
union
on
three
occasions
approached
him,
beginning
in
october
63
and
then
again
in
november
and
fall
in
april
and
asked
him
to
sign
the
contract
which
he
refused
to
do.
mr.
harris
weinstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
court
pleases,
as
just
before
the
recess,
i've
mentioned
that
on
three
occasions
between
october
1963
and
april
1964,
the
union
asked
that
respondent
to
execute
the
bargaining
agreement
and
each
time,
he
refused.
on
the
basis
of
these
facts,
the
union
filed
unfair
labor
practice
charges
in
the
board
upheld
and
ruled
that
respondent
had
not
under
his
duty
to
bargain.
on
a
petition
for
enforcement,
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
substantive
findings
and
last
january,
this
court
denied
respondents
petition
for
certiorari.
so
as
the
case
stands,
respondent
has
been
finally
adjudicated
to
have
unfairly
refused
to
bargain
and
the
controversy
goes
to
the
boards
order.
that
order
is
set
out
on
pages
120
and
121
of
the
record.
it
has
in
paragraph
1
some
cease
and
desist
directions
which
are
not
in
controversy.
it
directs
in
paragraph
2(a)
that
respondent
execute
and
honor
the
agreement
that
was
negotiated
and
that
is
not
in
controversy.
the
issue
goes
to
paragraph
2(b)
of
the
order.
mr.
harris
weinstein
b,
after
a,
which
directs
that
respondent
pay
to
the
appropriate
source
any
fringe
benefits
provided
for
in
the
above-described
contract.
and
also
an
issue
would
be
a
parallel
part
of
the
notice
to
employees
that
respondent
was
told
to
oppose
and
this
is
on
page
122,
the
third
indented
paragraph
and
that
would
have
set
in
the
notice,
we
will
make
hold
the
appropriate
sources
for
any
unpaid
fringe
benefits
provided
in
the
above
contract.
the
court
of
appeals
in
holding
that
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
these
are
set
out
in
the
contract,
agreed
in
the
contract
itself
which
are
on
the
record,
mr.
justice
stewart
-
i
think
on
page
66
-
and
it
sets
up
several
funds
to
which
payments
are
to
be
made,
there
is
a
health
and
welfare
trust,
there's
an
apprentice
trust,
there
are
two
other
funds
then
below,
there
is
a
roofer's
fund.
and
these
are
amounts
measured
by
the
hour
of
each
employee
that
were
supposed
to
be
paid
to
provide
for
a
variety
of
fringe
benefits.
the
basic
one
is
the
health
and
welfare
fund
and
the
roofers
fund.
and
that
the
order,
i
am
talking
to
the
appropriate
sources
to
[coughing]
mean
to
whomever
each
particular
item
would
have
been
paid
if
the
contract
had
been
executed
at
the
time
we
fashioned.
mr.
harris
weinstein
in
finding
this
paragraph
of
the
order
was
beyond
the
board's
power.
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
was,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
unfair
labor
practice
was
not
the
failure
to
pay
these
amounts
but
was
instead
just
a
refusal
to
execute
the
contract.
and
it
said
that
the
order
was,
and
i'm
quoting
from
their
opinion,
an
order
to
respondent
to
carry
out
provisions
of
the
contract
and
it
is
beyond
the
power
of
the
board.
so
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
if
an
order
of
the
board
directs
payment
of
a
benefit
required
by
a
contract,
whatever
else
the
circumstance
is
the
board
doesn't
have
power
to
do
that.
the
only
recourse
to
the
union
or
its
memberships
would
be
a
suit
against
the
employer
under
section
301
of
the
act.
now,
at
the
time
that
we
filed
our
briefs
here,
i
believe
there
had
been
eleven
cases
on
this
or
related
matters
and
this
was
the
only
one
that
found
the
board
without
power.
there
are
since
been
another
case
that
i
would
like
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
in
the
fourth
circuit.
it
is
called
nlrb
against
the
beverage
heir
company.
and
it
is
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
air,
beverages
and
drink
and
air
company
and
it's
reported
at
the
69
labor
relations
reference
manual
at
page
2369.
and
like
several
other
cases
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
all
the
other
cases
but
this
one,
it
allows
enforcement
of
an
order
such
as
we
have
before
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
harris
weinstein
2369,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
harris
weinstein
that
is
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
enforcing
a
decision
of
the
board.
mr.
harris
weinstein
fourth,
sir.
and
then
the
board,
part
of
the
order
that
is
discussed
and
that
is
enforced
is
essentially
similar
to
paragraph
2
(b)
of
the
order
here.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
presume
so.
now
in
the
final
analysis,
the
resolution
of
this
case
depends
on
the
construction
as
placed
upon
section
10
(c)
of
the
act.
that
tells
the
board
what
to
do
once
it
finds
an
unfair
labor
practice
and
as
the
source
of
the
boards
remedial
authority.
now,
essentially,
that
tells
the
board
to
do
two
things,
first,
to
enter
a
cease
and
desist
order
which
it
did
here;
and
then,
it
tells
the
board
to
take
such
affirmative
action
including
reinstatement
of
employees
with
or
without
back
pay
as
well
effectuate
the
policies
of
this
act.
a
long
line
of
cases,
going
back
to
the
inception
of
the
wagner
act,
this
court
has
looked
at
this
language
and
it
is
considered
what
it
allows
the
board
to
do
and
perhaps
the
most
recent
summary
of
the
authorities
is
in
the
five
aboard
decision
in
379
u.s.
but
the
thrust
of
it
is
simple.
the
board
is
directed
to
take
affirmative
action
and
that
action
should
be
whatever
is
needed
to
restore
things
to
what
they
would
have
been
without
the
unfair
labor
practice.
and
that
serves
two
functions:
first,
it
restores
the
bargaining
process.
it
let's
operates
it
operate
as
it
would
have
without
the
unfair
activity;
second,
it
takes
the
profit
out
of
unlawfulness.
it
takes
away
any
hope
of
gain
through
refusing
to
bargain.
it
deters
the
particular
respondent
and
other
people
from
illegal
conduct
and
encourages
them
to
voluntarily
perform
their
duties
under
the
act.
now,
we
would
think
that
under
this
analysis,
there's
extremely
strong
case
for
our
decision
without
looking
further.
the
board
has
an
affirmative
duty
to
provide
relief,
to
restore
the
status
quo
ante
the
violation.
the
cases,
the
11
unsolved
cases
that
have
been
reported
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
subject
show
that
basically
there
are
two
patterns.
either
as
in
this
case,
the
employer
has
refused
to
execute
a
contract
that
has
been
negotiated
by
him
or
on
his
behalf
and
the
board,
among
other
things,
says
to
the
employer,
pay
whatever
you
would
have
had
to
pay
if
you
would
executed
the
contract
in
a
timely
fashion.
mr.
harris
weinstein
as
of
this
moment,
yes.
i
think
this
was
litigated
all
through
petitions.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
it
is
refusing
to
sign
the
contract.
there
was
no
--
the
other
line
of
cases
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
refusing
to
sign
a
contract?
the
duty
to
bargain,
i
think,
has
been
interpreted
as
requiring
that
ones
a
contract
is
bargained
for
and
all
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
i
think
the
authorities
are
set
out
in
the
examiner's
opinion
here
which
the
board
accepted.
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
is
not.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
don't
think
that
there's
ever
been
any
dispute
about
the
duty
to
sign
(voice
overlap).
mr.
harris
weinstein
no,
mr.
justice
white
asked
me
if
it
was
conceded
here
that
there
had
been
an
unfair
labor
practice
which
i
took
to
mean
is
the
respondent
is
still
arguing
that
he
didn't
violate
the
act.
mr.
harris
weinstein
his
defenses
were
first
that
this
unfair
practice
was
not
thought
within
first
month
of
the
violation
of
the
act;
that
the
union,
by
its
conduct,
had
waived
it's
right
to
have
mr.
strong
sign
the
agreement.
i
think
those
are
basically
the
issues
that
we
presented
in
this
petition
for
certiorari
a
year
ago
and
that
the
refused
(voice
overlap).
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan,
last
january.
mr.
harris
weinstein
now,
we
had
our
time
for
petitioning.
it
was
not
the
same
as
the
respondents
because
we
had
filed
the
petition
for
rehearing
on
bank
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
our
petition
for
certiorari
was,
therefore,
not
do
until,
i
believe,
that
april
and
that's
when
we
filed
it.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
imagine
that
might
be
depending
on
the
circumstances,
mr.
justice
white.
for
example,
one
of
the
case
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
and
what
is
the
consequence
of
that?
the
other
line
of
cases,
i
think,
falls
on
the
category
of
just
refusing
to
pay
after
the
contract
is
executed.
for
example,
in
the
stam
(ph)
case,
which
i
think
was
in
the
seventh
circuit,
the
employer
had
unilaterally
amended
the
health
program
and
it
refused
to
bargain
over.
and
there,
the
amendment
itself
to
the
health
program,
the
unilateral
amendment
without
bargain
was
both
a
violation
of
the
contract
and
a
refusal
to
bargain.
but
in
either
instance
whether
the
case
is
like
that
one
or
this
one,
the
board
has
entered
in
order
requiring
that
the
employees
be
made
whole
for
what
they
have
been
deprived
of.
certainly,
in
this
case
while
the
payment
--
a
mere
refusal
to
pay
fringe
benefits
might
not
have
been
an
unfair
labor
practice
if
the
contract
had
been
sagged.
the
fact
that
this
weren't
paid
is
a
consequence
of
the
unfair
practice.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
it's
certainly
an
unfair
practice
to
refuse
to
sign.
now
whether
refusal
to
pay
is
itself
an
unfair
practice
depends.
for
example,
if
he
hadn't
paid
because
he
was
bankrupt.
i
imagine
that
wouldn't
be
an
unfair
practice
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
oh!
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
would
fall
apart
because
they
were
alive
and
part
on
the
fact
that
that
in
itself
on
this
record
wasn't
the
unfair
practice
that
was
found.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
have
some
problem
with
that.
certainly
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
it's
the
implication
of
what
they
said.
they
didn't
spell
that
out
that
way.
i
suppose
before
the
boards
action
here,
a
suit
had
been
brought
under
301.
i
assume
that
defense
would
have
been
there's
no
contract.
now,
if
the
courts
have
found
there
was
a
contract,
then
i
imagine
of
--
they
could
have
directed
payment
of
the
fringe
benefits.
now,
what
the
respondent
is
saying
here
is
there
must
be
a
two-step
proceeding.
first,
you
go
to
the
board
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
contract.
if
the
board
says
there
was
a
contract
and
orders
its
execution,
well
that
execution
is
retroactively
valid
but
the
board
can't
order
the
payment
of
the
benefits
then
you
got
to
go
to
arbitration
or
to
a
301
suit.
and
it's
this
analysis
that
we
are
saying
simply
doesn't
comfort
with
what
was
wrong.
mr.
harris
weinstein
no!
mr.
harris
weinstein
the
basis
of
our
cases
is
that
there
are
concurrent
evidence.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i'm
not
sure.
i
don't
think
that
he
would
get
being
contempt
if
he
hadn't
since
the
order
is
still
subject
to
litigation.
i
don't
know
whether
he
has.
well,
the
reasons
--
the
basis
for
the
view
that
the
court
of
appeals
to
abide,
i
think
there
are
two-folds,
and
they
find
the
root
in
legislative
inaction
and
action.
one
is
that
there
is
section
301
which
confers
jurisdiction
on
the
courts.
the
other
is
that
congress
declined
to
make
breach
of
a
contract
by
itself
in
unfair
labor
practice.
it's
a
pretty
weak
reads
but
the
inference
of
the
court
of
appeals
through
is
directly
refuted
by
the
act
because
section
10
(a)
of
the
act
says
that.
the
boards
power
to
remedy
on
unfair
labor
practices
shall
not
be
affected
by
any
other
means
of
adjustment
or
prevention
that
has
been
established
by
agreement
law
or
otherwise.
and,
the
interesting
thing
is,
that
congress
don't
seem
to
get
any
thought
that
there
was
any
possibility
that
it
was
the
best
thing
the
board
of
jurisdiction
to
act
in
a
case
like
this.
it
did
express
some
concern
that
section
301
could
be
limited
to
situations
where
there
was
no
unfair
labor
practice
and
the
committee
report
recognizes
that
possibility
and
expressly
says
that
when
there
are
two
remedies
-
one
before
the
board
and
one
before
the
courts,
they
are
cumulative
and
not
mutually
exclusive.
now,
this
court
also
have
to
say
it's
not
riding
on
a
thin
slake.
if
my
count
is
correct,
this
is
the
7th
time
in
7
years
that
the
court
has
had
occasion
to
comment
on
this
particular
problem.
the
first
three
cases
involves
the
problem
that
was
predicted
by
the
congress.
are
the
courts
in
some
manner
preempted
the
one
case,
lucas
was
questioned
as
our
state
courts
preempted
of
jurisdiction
by
section
301
without
regard
to
the
board.
the
next
two
cases,
the
smith
against
evening
news
case
in
371
u.s.,
carrie
against
westinghouse
in
375
u.s,
the
question
was
whether
the
board
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
the
delegation
of
the
courts
when
there
was
both
an
unfair
practice
and
a
violation
of
contract.
now,
the
issue
wasn't
before
the
court
in
those
cases
but
in
each
of
the
opinions,
the
court
took
care
to
say
that
it
was
not
suggesting
that
the
board
was
without
jurisdiction
and
expressly
said
in
each
instance
that
there
were
dual
remedies
available.
the
next
two
cases,
were
companion
cases
in
385
of
us
reports,
c
&
c
plywood
case
and
the
acne
industrial
case
-
and
then
each
of
those,
the
contention
was
that
the
board
was
without
jurisdiction
in
matters
that
could
be
adjudicated
before
the
courts
in
a
301
suit.
and
in
each
instance,
this
argument
was
rejected.
and
then,
in
the
great
dane
case
later
in
the
same
term,
a
similar
argument
had
been
made
in
the
court
of
appeals
but
was
dropped
when
this
case
reached
this
court.
but
the
court's
opinion
again
points
out
that
the
fact
that
there
is
jurisdiction
in
the
courts
under
301
does
not
deprived
a
board
of
jurisdiction.
now,
i
suppose
that
these
cases
could
be
distinguished
from
c
&
c
plywood
and
acne
industrial
on
the
ground
that
those
cases
involve
the
subject
matter
of
the
labor
board;
in
this
case
involves
its
power
authority
where
its
subject
matter
of
jurisdiction
is
not
in
issue.
but
we
would
suggest
that
these
cases
an
easier
one
for
finding
board
jurisdiction.
in
those
instances,
the
problem
was
there
were
matters
in
dispute
that
might
have
been
resolved
or
left
through
litigation
in
the
courts.
here,
the
disputed
matters
at
least,
as
the
contentions
have
been
framed,
are
not
things
that
are
ordinarily
decided
in
the
courts
in
section
301
(6).
the
contract
has
been
used
[coughing]
simply
as
the
measure
of
the
remedy.
it's
just
the
same,
i
would
think,
that
if
the
board
in
ordering
back
pay
as
used
in
oral
rate
established
by
a
contract
in
so
many
art
today.
i
suppose
if
we
follow
through
the
court
of
appeals'
analysis
to
its
logical
conclusion,
[coughing]
the
board
can
no
longer
order
back
pay
if
the
back
pay
is
based
on
a
rate
established
in
a
contract.
there's
nothing
in
controversy
here
on
what
the
contract
means
in
terms
of
the
fringe
benefits.
they
set
out
their
numerical
--
there's
just
a
calculation
to
be
made.
and
all
the
reasons
alluded
in
this
court's
opinion
in
c
&
c
and
acne
would
seem
to
require
the
same
result
here.
for
example
in
acne,
the
court
discussed
the
difficulties
that
would
arise
from
having
two
proceedings
and
matters
of
that
sort.
there's
no
reason
to
put
the
union
or
its
members
to
a
duality
of
proceedings.
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
the
board
is
devoid
of
jurisdiction,
wants
it
to
act
to
cure
a
violation
that
it's
found.
i
think
there's
one
other
point
that
requires
brief
mention.
much
of
the
respondent's
brief
on
the
merits
is
devoted
to
an
argument
that
the
grievance
and
arbitration
provisions
of
this
particular
contract
forbid
the
board's
action.
as
i
understand
that
they
are
saying
that
whenever
there
is
an
arbitration
and
grievance
procedure,
the
board
can't
make
any
order
that
could
have
been
entered
by
an
arbitrator.
well,
first,
i
think
this
is
the
first
mention
of
arbitration
in
this
case.
i'm
familiar
with
no
request
for
arbitration
nor
suggestion
that
this
matter
could
have
been
arbitrated
and
i
would
assume
from
the
way
the
arbitration
clause
is
worded,
it's
should
question
whether
the
arbitrated
would
speak
to
the
existence
of
the
contract.
but
all
this
isn't
really
pertinent
because
i
think
the
court
again
has
disposed
of
the
contention
both
in
the
case
of
carrie
against
westinghouse
and
the
acne
industrial
case.
each
time
the
court
had
occasion
to
discuss
the
interrelationship
between
arbitration
and
the
board's
activities,
in
carrie
the
claim
was
that
the
board's
jurisdiction
excluded
arbitration;
in
acne
the
claim
was
the
presence
of
an
arbitration
clause
for
the
board
to
act
in
each
time
the
court
held
that
there
was
a
duality
of
jurisdiction
and
pointed
out
that
the
reasons
that
were
applied
in
steelworkers
trilogy
to
require
the
courts
to
defer
arbitration
didn't
apply
in
a
board
proceedings.
no
doubt
the
board
here
could
have,
if
the
matter
warranted
it
send
them
direct
arbitration.
it
could
have
deferred
to
arbitration.
but
there's
absolutely
no
reason
why
it
had
to
withhold
its
hand
and
instead
rely
on
some
other
internal
inter-party
process.
thank
you.
mr.
harris
weinstein
if,
mr.
chief
justice
of
court
pleases,
i
simply
suggest
that
all
the
arguments
that
have
been
advanced
in
this
court,
in
that
arbitration
which
were
not
advanced
before
the
labor
board
and
the
court
of
appeals
are
all
disposed
of
by
mr.
justice
douglas
as
an
opinion
for
the
court
in
carrie
against
westinghouse
where
the
court
discusses
the
considerable
length
of
the
relationship
between
arbitration
and
board
proceedings,
makes
clear
that
these
are
alternatives
available
to
the
complaining
party
and
goes
so
far
to
say
that
in
the
event
of
conflict,
the
boards
ruling
would
have
coursed
to
take
precedents.
now,
as
that
opinion
points
out,
the
board
may
and
has
in
a
variety
of
occasions
deferred
or
invoke
the
arbitration
of
a
circumstances
seems
appropriate
and
the
parties
asked
for
it
in
a
timely
and
proper
way
with
three
simple
grounds
for
doing
it.
but
that
has
to
be
done
in
a
timely
way
before
the
board.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
boards
power
and
that
is
the
only
issue
here.
the
board
can,
if
it
wishes
use
arbitration,
if
the
disputes
develops
in
calculating
what
is
due
under
this
order
here.
the
court
can,
if
it
wishes,
go
to
the
trustees
under
this
agreement.
it
can
call
them
in,
it
can
invoke
arbitration.
mr.
harris
weinstein
yes,
sir.
mr.
harris
weinstein
mr.
justice
fortas,
the
board's
decision
is
that
it
has
the
option.
if
there
was
a
dispute,
the
board
would
hold
a
proceeding
to
resolve
the
dispute.
justice
powell
would
hold
the
proceeding
to
determine
whether
there's
been
an
unfair
practice.
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
the
fair
answer
to
that
was
that
because
there
was
no
suggestion
before
that
anything
other
than
a
mathematical
computation
was
required.
the
board,
in
writing
its
order,
didn't
consider
whether
pursuant
to
the
contract
incorporated
submission
to
the
trustees
under
what
i
told
the
state
clause
of
the
agreement.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
that
contention
is
really
to
be
brought
in
that
there
would
so
equitable
grounds
that
would
require
a
lesser
payment
that
the
mathematical
computation
calls
for
that
the
burden
would
be
on
the
employer,
dwell
into
the
board
and
request
elaboration
of
its
order.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
board
has
the
authority
to
do
it
either
way.
and
in
this
case,
what's
been
brought
into
oral
argument
here
is
a
matter
that
was
not
brought
to
the
board
itself
in
a
timely
fashion.
i
don't
think
it
was
controverted.
mr.
harris
weinstein
it
wasn't
raised
below?
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
think
i
would
start
by
saying
that
because
of
the
ordinary
course
of
board
proceedings
disputes
over
computation
would
be
resolved
after
the
order
becomes
final
that
the
issue
wasn't
before
the
court.
i
would
suggest
though
that
if
the
court
would
going
to
decide
that
issue
against
the
board,
it
would
require
considerable
back
tracking
on
the
analysis
on
the
carrie
opinion
and
the
acne
opinion.
that
it
would
require
what
we
would
suggest
this
an
inconsistency
with
section
10
(a)
of
the
act
which
says
that
the
private
--
mr.
harris
weinstein
i
would
think
that
as
the
case
is
framed
and
as
--
because
of
the
arguments
had
been
made
earlier.
what
you've
stated
as
your
second
reading
of
the
issue
isn't
in
the
case.
it's
not.
i
think
that
the
--
again,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
matters
discussed
in
the
carrie
decision
which
showed
the
way,
the
board
decides
whether
to
defer
to
contract
machinery.
thank
you.
