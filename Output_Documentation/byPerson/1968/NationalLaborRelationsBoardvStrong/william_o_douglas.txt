justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
let
me
see
of
(inaudible)
statute.
what
you
are
saying
is
that
the
way
this
agreement
would
work
would
be
that
the
company
would
be
required
to
withdraw
that.
what
you
said,
i
don't
understand
how
this
agreement
would
work.
the
board
says,
you
must
pay
whatever
you
owe
under
the
contract.
company
says,
alright,
here's
what
we
calculated.
we
owe
$25
under
the
contract
and
we
pay
that
to
the
trustees.
and
if
there's
no
objection
on
that,
that
ends
the
matter,
alright?
