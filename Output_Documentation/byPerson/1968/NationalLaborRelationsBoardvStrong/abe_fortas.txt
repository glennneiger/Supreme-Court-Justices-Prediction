well,
it
doesn't
hurt
your
case
if
the
court
doesn't?
justice
abe
fortas
if
that
they
could
bring
that
one
under
this
301,
you
would
still
be
making
argument
you
are
now.
justice
abe
fortas
industry
why
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
abe
fortas
so
the
right,
so
the
trustees
representing
the
unions
and
some
trustees
representing
management
throughout
the
industry,
at
least
cited
industry,
covered
by
this
supreme
court.
so
what
they
would
do
under
the
board
order,
i
think,
it
is
to
go
to
trustees
and
the
employer
would
say,
well,
we
calculate
that
this
is
x
and
here's
what
we
owe
you?
and
if
the
union
disagrees,
that
would
say
no.
he
would
say
to
the
trustees
that
we
think
the
company
owes
us
more?
justice
abe
fortas
--
and
what
it
says
the
board
order
--
i
assume
that
the
board
order
was
phrased
or
a
peculiar
way
it
is
just
to
provide
for
payment
to
the
trustees
and
the
submission
in
matter
to
the
trustees
as
if
it
worked
than
made
under
the
bargaining
originally.
would
you
mind
telling
us,
i've
forgotten
the
exact
language
of
the
board
order
if
they
shall
pay
the
fringe
benefits
or
what?
justice
abe
fortas
--
phrase
appropriate
source
just
to
mean
the
trustees
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
abe
fortas
benefits
are
not
payable
to
the
individual
and
employee
directly,
was
it?
justice
abe
fortas
it
goes
to
the
trustees?
justice
abe
fortas
meaning
the

justice
abe
fortas
now,
apart
from
what
the
arbitrator
will
determine
on
what
your
construction
of
the
trilogy,
which
you
call
it
trilogy,
if
the
board
says
that
our
opinion,
our
order
means
that
you
have
to
pay
what
you're
obligated
under
the
contract
and
that's
to
be
determined
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
contract.
i
don't
know
whether
it
will
or
not
but
it
says
here
that
(inaudible)
of
you
could
be
very
happy.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
you
say
that
and
then
the
arbitrator
may
or
may
not
allow
it
and
if
he
does
agree
with
you,
the
court
may
or
may
not
overrule.
justice
abe
fortas
that's
because
of
what
justice
douglas
wrote
in
the

justice

then
they
say
that
to
the
board,
they
will
report
to
the
board
that
the
compliance
officer
will
pay
$25
to
the
trustees.
but
suppose
the
union
comes
in
and
says,
that
isn't
correct.
they
owe
$2500
and
now
what
happens?
there
are
two
possibilities;
one
is
the
determination
of
that
amount
would
be
made
by
the
contract
machinery;
the
other
possibility
is
that
the
board
itself
would
undertake
to
determine
the
amount
which
means
that
would
have
to
construe
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
now,
what
is
the
board's
position?
justice
