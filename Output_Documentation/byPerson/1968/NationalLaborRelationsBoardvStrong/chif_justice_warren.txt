d?
mr.

mr.
bakaly?
mr.
chif
justice
warren
is
that
the
gist
of
your
argument?
mr.
chif
justice
warren
suppose
in
this
case
a
labor
board
or
the
respondent
in
this
case
had,
in
addition
to
refusing
to
sign
the
contract
that
fired
all
the
employees,
could
the
board
then
find
that
that
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
order
to
be
restored?
mr.
chif
justice
warren
they
could
have?
mr.
chif
justice
warren
with
back
pay?
mr.
chif
justice
warren
why
couldn't
the
fringe
benefits
go
with
it?
mr.
chif
justice
warren
(laughter)
mr.
chif
justice
warren
was
he
allowed
to
use
equitable
fringe
benefit?
mr.
chif
justice
warren
and
so
you
mean
he
got
them
on
a
lower
price?
mr.
chif
justice
warren
and
now,
an
arbitrator
might
say,
well,
under
all
these
circumstances,
he
thought
he
was
out
from
under
the
agreement
and
therefore
he
ought
not
have
to
pay
more
than
the
fringe
benefits
less
access.
mr.
chif
justice
warren
well
let
me
tell
you
would
be
very
happy
of
what
the
labor
board
says
of
what
it
means
that
you
were
to
pay
whatever
is
to
be
determined
and
that
the
determination
is
to
be
made
pursuant
to
the
contract
including
(inaudible)
up
to
the
extent
available
arbitration
then
you'd
be
happy.
