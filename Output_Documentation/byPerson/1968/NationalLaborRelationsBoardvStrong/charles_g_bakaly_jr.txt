mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
four
questions
of
facts
that
would
--
should
keep
on
mind.
first,
mr.
strong
was
bound
by
the
industry
contract
as
a
matter
of
law
at
the
time
that
it
was
negotiated
in
august
of
1963.
the
bylaws
of
the
association
so
provided,
the
board's
brief,
page
2
concedes
the
record
35
and
sets
out
the
bylaws.
under
wylee
vs.
livingstone
in
this
court's
decision,
section
301
action
that
appellee
arbitration
would
certainly
have
been
proper
in
wylee
as
you
recall.
the
employer,
who
was
held
to
be
bound
to
arbitrate
that
was
not
a
party
to
the
contract
as
predecessor
company
was
a
party
and
this
court
held
that
he
must
arbitrate.
furthermore,
that
the
failure
to
pay
fringe
benefits
was
not
alleged
that's
an
unfair
labor
practice.
so
either
the
complaint
or
found
by
the
board
or
the
court
of
appeals.
the
order
finally
is
to
pay
to
the
appropriate
source
any
fringe
benefits
provided
for
in
the
above-described
contract.
we
feel
that
this
case
presents
for
the
first
time
a
conflict
between
a
national
labor
policy
preferring
arbitration
and
the
position
of
the
labor
board
that
it
has
the
power
to
decide
whether
we
have
breached
the
contract
by
the
failure
to
pay
fringe
benefits.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that
is
basically,
your
honor.
a
similar
conflict,
the
course
has
been
resolved
by
this
court,
a
conflict
between
courts
and
arbitrators
had
been
resolved
by
this
court
in
the
now
famous
trilogy
wherein
the
policy
was
set
that
in
labor
management
matters
it
is
for
the
arbitrator
to
decide
that
a
collective
[coughing]
bargaining
agreement
is
not
a
contract
and
from
our
law,
it
says
it's
a
code
of
conduct
and
that
the
arbitrator
should
be
free
to
imply
provisions
that
may
or
may
not
exists.
now,
the
same
reasons
apply
that
to
keep
the
court
out
of
such
disputes,
to
keep
the
board
out
of
such
disputes.
as
this
court
said,
the
ablest
judge
cannot
be
expected
to
bring
the
same
experience
and
competence
to
bear
on
the
determination
of
agreements.
similarly,
the
labor
board,
just
as
the
court,
does
not
have
the
competence.
the
labor
board
has
been
given
by
congress
competence
in
its
field
to
determine
whether
the
act
has
been
violated.
it
is
not,
we
submit.
with
all
due
respect,
they've
given
the
labor
board
competence
to
decide
breaches
of
the
contract.
the
labor
board
interestingly
enough
in
several
very
recent
cases,
we
respectfully
submit
it
as
demonstrative
and
it
is
not
so
competent.
and
adams
jerry
this
case
is
we
have
not
cited
in
our
brief.
they
are
labor
board
cases
but
in
a
series
of
labor
board
cases
commencing
with
adams
jerry,
including
the
cns
industries,
the
labor
board
has
held
that
if
the
contract
is
silent
about
a
particular
provision,
then
the
employer
or
the
union,
whoever
it
may
be,
is
not
bound
or
arbitrate
or
the
labor
board
can
interpret
that
provision
in
a
way
it
wants.
now,
that
is
a
strict
disagreement
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
trilogy
that
holds
that
where
a
contract
is
silent,
an
arbitrator
might
well
imply
a
restriction
or
a
right
from
the
conduct
of
the
parties
or
from
other
source.
the
reading
case,
the
warrior
case
in
this
court
was
a
subcontracting
case.
here,
in
adams
jerry
the
labor
board
held
that
you
shouldn't
have
to
go
to
arbitration
because
the
only
thing
the
arbitrator
can
do
was
to
interpret
the
contract
under
its
provision.
this,
to
me,
shows
that
the
labor
board
does
not
competence
of
the
trilogy
and
the
arbitrator
has
more
power
than
to
just
interpret
the
contract.
he
has
the
power
to
regulate
parties
from
all
of
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
or
the
employees
restored,
yes.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
they
could
have
ordered
the
employees
to
be
reinstated
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
and
they
could
have
ordered
back
pay
and
that's
specifically
provided
for
under
the
statute.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
that's
the
very
hard
question
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice
but
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
the
reason,
i
think,
first
of
all
goes
to
the
fact
that
if
they
had
discharged
the
employees,
they
would
have
done
so
with
an
anti-union
analyst
and
i
do
think
that
it
could
be
a
distinction
between
the
employer
acting
with
the
anti-union
analyst
and
an
employer
acting
mistakenly
but
in
good
faith.
and
here,
this
employer,
it
was
so
found
with
an
honest
belief
that
he
had
withdrawn
from
the
association.
he
has
not
done
so
but
he
was
not
engaged
in
trying
to
destroy
the
union.
and
that
itself
facts,
i
would
not
say
that
the
board
could
not,
as
a
question
of
power
for
the
fringe
benefits.
that
is
not
in
this
case
and
i
would
say
that
it's
a
question
of
policy.
a
board
should
not
order
fringe
benefits
even
in
back
case.
the
board
should
reach
the
threshold
question.
if
i
may
say,
it
has
the
act
been
violated.
and
then
as
the
court
so
required
to
do,
leave
to
an
arbitrator
that
he
cite
what
the
provisions
are,
what
the
employer
should
do
and
then
what
the
union
should
do
of
them
in
the
threshold
question.
in
your
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
reinstate
the
employees
and
labor
arbitrator
decide
the
fringe
benefits.
to
me,
a
question
of
policy
is
among
orally
ways
to
effectuate
policies
of
the
act
which
are
to
have
the
parties
decide
through
a
system
of
arbitration
under
section
203
(d).
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
was
refusing
to
sign
the
contract
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
section
8(d).
it's
a5
but
also
it's
8(d)
of
the
act
specifically
states
that
they
signed
the
contract
that
has
been
agreed
to.
i
know
if
you
will
agree
with
the
board
that
they
were
bound
of
this
association
and
it
was
agreed
to
under
8(d)
of
the
act,
the
employer
was
(voice
overlap)
to
sign
the
contract.
excuse
me.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
that
the
union
could
have
brought
the
301
action
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
we're
relying
on
that
but
obviously
under
(voice
overlap)
the
evening
news
there
is
contract
jurisdiction.
i
believe
in
that
case,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
the
court
said
there
will
going
to
be
problems
over
the
fact.
there's
concurrent
jurisdiction
and
this
is
one
of
those
problems
but
we're
accepting
that.
we're
not
suggesting
this
meant
where
as
the
evening
news
goes.
you
overruled
by
any
means
and
there
is
contract
jurisdiction
in
the
case
like
this.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
between
arbitration
and
the
labor
board
or
court
to
compel
arbitration
to
go
to
the
labor
board.
the
arguments
against?
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
evening
news
merely
decided
that
a
section
301
action
would
lack
and
did
not
decide
the
question
of
the
power
of
the
labor
board
to
interpret
the
breached
contract
and
congress
had
before
to
see
when
the
taftâ€“hartley
act
was
passed
the
proposal.
but
the
labor
board
being
given
the
power
that
the
breach
of
a
contract
was
an
unfair
labor
practice,
congress
refused
to
pass
that
portion
of
the
statute
and
we
think
that
is
evidenced
of
a
congressional
purpose
not
to
give
the
board
jurisdiction
over
matters
like
this
where
they
have
to
get
into
and
i
--
just
a
moment.
i
get
to
the
items
that
they
are
going
to
have
into
this.
this
is
not
just
the
question
of
calculating
benefits.
they're
going
to
have
to
interpret
this
agreement.
and
we
submit
that
that's
for
an
arbitrator
to
do.
now,
let's
get
to
the
arguments
that
the
board
had
made
that
it
is
a
windfall
here
to
the
employer.
that
is
not
correct,
may
it
please
the
court
as
we
read
the
enterprise
case
which
was
one
of
the
trilogy
and
which
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
had
expired,
which
agreements
or
disputes
had
arose
at
these
employers
obligated
to
arbitrate
today;
obligated
to
arbitrate
now
the
question
of
fringe
benefits.
and
the
only
reason
the
employer
has
not
signed
the
agreement
the
employer
has
not
yet
signed
the
agreement
if
they
could
have
offered
to
and
the
regional
director
said,well,
why
don't
you
wait
until
that
supreme
court
decides
and
then
we'll
give
in
the
compliance.
the
employer
is
ready
to
sign
and
will
sign
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
this
matter,
of
course,
tell
that
employer
was
found
obligated
to
the
contract,
had
never
reasoned.
that
was
the
employer's
first
assessment.
but
right
now,
under
the
contract
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
no,
sir,
that
is
not
correct.
let
me
first
draw
the,
starting
on
page
62
and
63
of
the
record,
list
the
fringe
benefits.
they
might
be
subject
to
cut
duration
although
it's
a
fairly
complicated
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
i'm
sure
you
realize.
but
on
page
71,
this
is
the
first
place,
it
lists
a
series
of
penalties
that
will
happen
to
an
employer
if
he
does
not
pay
the
fringe
benefits.
and
there
it
says,
paragraph
f,
a
contract
here
may
be
absorbed
of
any
or
all
foregoing
liabilities
if
he
satisfies
the
trustees
if
he
has
failed
to
pay
any
contributions
or
to
report
because
of
honest
mistake
in
the
contribution's,
clerical
error,
or
other
reasons
satisfactory
now.
the
labor
board
shouldn't
decide
whether
under
these
circumstances
the
employer
should
not
have
to
pay
these
penalties
because
of
honest
mistake
that
he
was
obligated.
the
labor
board
should
not
decide
that.
the
arbitrator
opt
to
decide
that.
the
arbitrator
might
well
decide
here.
excuse
me.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
it's
correct.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
board
has
in
mind
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice
fortas.
the
board
has
in
mind
going
to
the
compliance
officer
in
region
21
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
letting
him
decide
whether
we
have
a
good
faith
in
that.
they
don't
have
in
mind
going
to
the
trustee?
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
pay
to
the
appropriate
source
any
fringe
benefits
provided
for
in
the
above-described
contract?
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
as
far
as
the
appropriate
source
under
the
direction
of
the
compliance
officer
of
the
board,
i
don't
believe
they
are
going
to
permit
the
trustees
or
an
arbitrator
to
this
stage
or
leave
us
of
the
payment
again
in
these
benefits
if
they
find
for
example
that
we
should
have
to
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
oh!
no,
it's
paid
to
the
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
it's
paid
to
the
appropriate
source
of
a
trust
fund.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
the
trust
fund.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that's
right.
but
their
different
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
what
it
says
is
in
accordance
with
the
agreement.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that's
right
and
i'm
sure
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
think
we
have
if
i
now
in
practice
one
of
--
i've
never
heard
of
anyone
other
than
the
board
compliance
officer
having
anything
to
do
with
disputes
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
board
order
in
any
other
back
pay
proceeding.
this
is
another
policy,
the
reason
why
we
suggest
that
the
--
ought
to
be
the
law.
this
is
not
the
end
of
this
matter.
there's
going
to
be
some
disputes
here.
i
think
what
will
happen
(inaudible)
indication
is
if
we
don't
agree
with
the
compliance
officer,
we
will
go
to
a
back
pay
hearing.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
before
the
board;
that's
before
the
board.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
a
back
pay?
let
the
board
speak
but
my
practice
has
been
that
a
trial
examiner
on
the
labor
board
will
be
heard.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
that
is
as
long
as
this
order
is
in
effect
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
as
long
as
this
order
is
in
effect,
it's
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
and
the
compliance
practices
of
the
board.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
has
taken
the
place?
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that's
their
position
as
my
understanding,
mr.
justice
black.
they
can
speak
to
that
but
that's
my
understanding
that
it
will
be
the
board,
in
any
wage
case,
as
mr.
justice
warren
stated,
an
ordinary
discharge
for
union
activity
case
and
you
have
a
dispute
with
the
board
about
how
much
you
owe
that
person,
that
dispute
is
solved.
and
a
back
pay
here
before
another
representative
of
the
labor
board
and
you
have
another
case.
that
goes
up
now.
that's
why,
we
say
that
right
now
is
the
time
to
not
enforce
this
portion
of
the
order
at
this
time
but
leave
the
parties
to
enforce
it
either
themselves.
may
be
the
parties
will
get
together
and
agree
how
much
is
do
and
resolve
this
whole
thing.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
what
we
expect
to
get
by
an
(voice
overlap)
arbitrator
is
just
this
kind
of
back
pay,
mr.
justice
black.
this
is
a
small
employer.
he
thought
he
could
not
compete
and
meet
the
union
wage
scale.
and
that's
exactly
the
story
and
we
tried
to
get
out
of
the
union
and
he
got
jobs
that
he
probably
wouldn't
have
gotten,
wouldn't
have
obtained
if
he
had
to
pay
all
the
conditions
and
so
forth.
now,
we
think
that
is
a
factor
that
an
arbitrator
would
take
into
consideration
that?
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
might
well
here
because
his
employees
were
not
union
employees.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
sir.
as
we
stated
--
and
an
arbitrator
you
can
look
at
production,
productivity.
he
can
look
at
all
sorts
of
things
that
a
court
and
a
board
can.
that's
the
purpose
for
the
trilogy
as
mr.
justice
douglas
brought
it.
that
was
the
purpose
of
it.
an
arbitrator,
in
the
rule
of
common
law,
in
the
rules
of
the
(inaudible)
so
far
to
arrive
at
the
decision
that
the
court
or
the
labor
board
would
not
arrive
at.
and
then
this
is
what
we
think.
here
there's
an
equitable
argument
here.
this
man
would
not
have
hold
these
fringe
benefits
if
he
had
gotten
the
jobs
and
the
only
reason
he
got
to
work,
put
on
the
rules,
was
because
he
didn't
have
to
pay
these
fringe
benefits.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that's
right.
now,
this
penalty
they
might
issue
and
have
to
pay
this
because
it
was
an
honest
fall,
that
is
not
a
false
act
to
try
to
destroy
the
union
a
little
of
what
it
was
and
some
other
and
further
operation.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i've
never
known
that,
mr.
justice
black.
(voice
overlap)
i've
never
known
that
the
board
in
compliance
proceeding
doing
anything
but
determining
the
matter
for
themselves
in
the
board
and
can
speaks
for
itself.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
its'
normally
done
in
the
context
of
the
back
pay
hearing
without
official
--.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
don't
have
that
confidence
in
the
board,
mr.
justice
brennan
when
in
these
cases
like
i
just
read
adams
jerry
and
so
are
they,
they
looked
at
the
agreement.
they
say,
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
does
not
contain
a
subcontracting
clause,
then
there's
nothing
to
arbitrate.
that
is
directly
contrary
to
that,
mr.
justice
douglas.
this
decision
in
the
trilogy
directly
contrary
to
it.
the
labor
board,
in
all
due
respect,
is
competent
in
determining
whether
unfair
labor
practice
is,
it
has
very
little
competence
and
has
evidence
to
it
by
these
recent
cases
in
one
of
breach
of
contract
is
in
this
area.
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
a
very
low
competence
in
interpreting
competence,
in
interpreting
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
this
is
the
system
that
we
are
under,
mr.
justice
black.
when
you
have
a
contract
that
has
a
monetary
arbitration
clause,
you're
under
the
system
and
i
guess
it's
been
very
few
times
that
an
employer
stood
before
this
court
and
contended
for
arbitrability.
but
were
here
and
were
so
contending
because
we
are
accepting
the
principle.
we
shouldn't
have
to
have
two
proceedings;
we're
going
to
have
another
proceeding.
now,
there
are
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
was
about
to
say
there
are
--
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
no
it
would
not
because
an
arbitrator
still
could
be
able
to
say,
as
i
mentioned
under
this
circumstances,
i'm
going
to
say
that
equity
dictates
at
the
employer
not
have
to
pay
even
though
it
was
trickily
calculated.
you
see,
before
the
trilogy.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
it
would
be
the
same.
excuse
me,
i
must
have
misspoke
that.
our
argument
would
be
the
same
as
it
is
now.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
this
court
has
so
held.
this
court
and
nothing
down
the
cutler
hammer
doctrine
which
said
that
you
couldn't
arbitrate
a
dispute
if
the
language
was
clear
and
unambiguous.
this
court
knocked
that
doctrine
down
and
correctly
so
even
though
the
language
is
clear
and
unambiguous.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
the
parties
have
contracted
even
though
the
language
is
maybe
clear
and
unambiguous.
the
parties
have
contracted
to
have
an
arbitrator
decide
this.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
that's
entirely
possible,
mr.
justice
black,
entirely
possible
on
the
labor
context.
entirely
possible
and
yet
it's
not
clear
here.
let
me
say
that
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct,
that
position
was
there.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
we've
offered
the
same,
mr.
justice
marshall.
somebody
had
to
decide.
there
is
a
serious
question
here
in
the
statute's
limitation.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
it
was
up
to
the
expert.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct.
but
it's
up
to
the
union,
mr.
justice
marshall.
they
could
have
filed
a
grievance
and
they
could
have
gone
to
arbitration
and
they
could
have
compelled
us
to
do
so.
we
had,
as
i
said
earlier,
the
labor
board
decide,
can
decide
here
the
threshold
question.
was
there
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
refusing
to
sign
the
contract?
that
doesn't
mean
they
have
to
take
the
case
for
all
purposes.
fabricated
proceedings
are
nothing
new
to
this
court.
that's
what
is
count
by
the
trilogy.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
correct.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
nothing
unusual
about
that.
that's
correct.
there's
nothing
unusual
about
that.
that
what
happens
if
an
employer
contends
a
dispute
is
not
subject
to
arbitration.
under
the
agreement,
the
court
first
determines
whether
it
is
and
if
it
determines
that
it
is,
you
don't
have
an
arbitration.
we're
going
to
have
that
hearing,
mr.
justice
black,
because
i'm
sure
there's
going
to
be
a
back
pay
hearing
in
this
case
because
there
are
questions
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
to
meaning
and
intent.
it
says
there
are
certain
penalties
for
the
non-payment
of
health
and
welfare
benefits
yet
it
says
a
contract
too
an
important
and
may
be
absorbed
if
he
is
in
good
faith.
and,
somebody
is
going
to
determine
whether
we
have
to
pay
these
penalties
or
not.
there
are
provisions
here
about
hours
of
work.
that
may
well
be
a
fringe
benefit.
well,
i
don't
know
what
a
fringe
benefit
is
and
i'm
sure
you
can
make
a
good
argument
that
hours
of
work
is
a
fringe
benefit.
what
about
if
it
says
work
must
be
done
outside
the
regular
working
hours
for
the
protection
of
life
or
property?
the
labor
board
cannot
decide
that
back
pay
here?
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
if
the
labor
board
permits
the
arbitrator
to
determine
this,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
think
that's
what
law
would
be.
in
arbitration
there's
no
misunderstanding.
in
that
arbitration,
we
would
contend
that
even
though
it
says
7
cents
an
hour,
the
health
and
welfare
because
of
this
equitable
considerations
which
shouldn't
have
paid
any.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
it
would
be
very
surprised,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
the
court
will
overrule
an
arbitrator.
if
he
rules
on
our
favor,
we
would
have
to
take
what
is
the
decision.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
of
what
this
court
said.
there's
some
other
provisions
but
from
labor
board
he's
going
to
in
this
case
after
interpreting
this
collective
bargaining
agreement.
we
think
that
that
is
for
the
arbitrator
to
do
and
it
would
be
an
orally
procedure.
there's
not
going
to
be
unneeded
bifurcation.
the
policy
of
the
act
as
counsel
here
has
said
[coughing],
also
as
a
section
in
section
203
(d)
the
final
adjustment
by
a
method
agreed
upon
by
the
parties
is
hereby
declared
to
be
desirable
method
for
settlement/agreement
of
disputes.
and,
we
submit
that
a
threshold
question?
fine,
but
the
labor
board
decides
or
a
court
concurrent
jurisdiction.
once
the
labor
board
has
decided
there's
a
contract,
then
let's
have
all
of
the
contract
be
applicable
including
the
grievance
and
arbitration
provisions
of
the
agreement.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
at
the
outset,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
four
questions
of
facts
that
would
--
should
keep
on
mind.
first,
mr.
strong
was
bound
by
the
industry
contract
as
a
matter
of
law
at
the
time
that
it
was
negotiated
in
august
of
1963.
the
bylaws
of
the
association
so
provided,
the
board's
brief,
page
2
concedes
the
record
35
and
sets
out
the
bylaws.
under
wylee
vs.
livingstone
in
this
court's
decision,
section
301
action
that
appellee
arbitration
would
certainly
have
been
proper
in
wylee
as
you
recall.
the
employer,
who
was
held
to
be
bound
to
arbitrate
that
was
not
a
party
to
the
contract
as
predecessor
company
was
a
party
and
this
court
held
that
he
must
arbitrate.
furthermore,
that
the
failure
to
pay
fringe
benefits
was
not
alleged
that's
an
unfair
labor
practice.
so
either
the
complaint
or
found
by
the
board
or
the
court
of
appeals.
the
order
finally
is
to
pay
to
the
appropriate
source
any
fringe
benefits
provided
for
in
the
above-described
contract.
we
feel
that
this
case
presents
for
the
first
time
a
conflict
between
a
national
labor
policy
preferring
arbitration
and
the
position
of
the
labor
board
that
it
has
the
power
to
decide
whether
we
have
breached
the
contract
by
the
failure
to
pay
fringe
benefits.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that
is
basically,
your
honor.
a
similar
conflict,
the
course
has
been
resolved
by
this
court,
a
conflict
between
courts
and
arbitrators
had
been
resolved
by
this
court
in
the
now
famous
trilogy
wherein
the
policy
was
set
that
in
labor
management
matters
it
is
for
the
arbitrator
to
decide
that
a
collective
[coughing]
bargaining
agreement
is
not
a
contract
and
from
our
law,
it
says
it's
a
code
of
conduct
and
that
the
arbitrator
should
be
free
to
imply
provisions
that
may
or
may
not
exists.
now,
the
same
reasons
apply
that
to
keep
the
court
out
of
such
disputes,
to
keep
the
board
out
of
such
disputes.
as
this
court
said,
the
ablest
judge
cannot
be
expected
to
bring
the
same
experience
and
competence
to
bear
on
the
determination
of
agreements.
similarly,
the
labor
board,
just
as
the
court,
does
not
have
the
competence.
the
labor
board
has
been
given
by
congress
competence
in
its
field
to
determine
whether
the
act
has
been
violated.
it
is
not,
we
submit.
with
all
due
respect,
they've
given
the
labor
board
competence
to
decide
breaches
of
the
contract.
the
labor
board
interestingly
enough
in
several
very
recent
cases,
we
respectfully
submit
it
as
demonstrative
and
it
is
not
so
competent.
and
adams
jerry
this
case
is
we
have
not
cited
in
our
brief.
they
are
labor
board
cases
but
in
a
series
of
labor
board
cases
commencing
with
adams
jerry,
including
the
cns
industries,
the
labor
board
has
held
that
if
the
contract
is
silent
about
a
particular
provision,
then
the
employer
or
the
union,
whoever
it
may
be,
is
not
bound
or
arbitrate
or
the
labor
board
can
interpret
that
provision
in
a
way
it
wants.
now,
that
is
a
strict
disagreement
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
trilogy
that
holds
that
where
a
contract
is
silent,
an
arbitrator
might
well
imply
a
restriction
or
a
right
from
the
conduct
of
the
parties
or
from
other
source.
the
reading
case,
the
warrior
case
in
this
court
was
a
subcontracting
case.
here,
in
adams
jerry
the
labor
board
held
that
you
shouldn't
have
to
go
to
arbitration
because
the
only
thing
the
arbitrator
can
do
was
to
interpret
the
contract
under
its
provision.
this,
to
me,
shows
that
the
labor
board
does
not
competence
of
the
trilogy
and
the
arbitrator
has
more
power
than
to
just
interpret
the
contract.
he
has
the
power
to
regulate
parties
from
all
of
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
or
the
employees
restored,
yes.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
they
could
have
ordered
the
employees
to
be
reinstated
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
and
they
could
have
ordered
back
pay
and
that's
specifically
provided
for
under
the
statute.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
that's
the
very
hard
question
in
this
case,
mr.
chief
justice
but
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
the
reason,
i
think,
first
of
all
goes
to
the
fact
that
if
they
had
discharged
the
employees,
they
would
have
done
so
with
an
anti-union
analyst
and
i
do
think
that
it
could
be
a
distinction
between
the
employer
acting
with
the
anti-union
analyst
and
an
employer
acting
mistakenly
but
in
good
faith.
and
here,
this
employer,
it
was
so
found
with
an
honest
belief
that
he
had
withdrawn
from
the
association.
he
has
not
done
so
but
he
was
not
engaged
in
trying
to
destroy
the
union.
and
that
itself
facts,
i
would
not
say
that
the
board
could
not,
as
a
question
of
power
for
the
fringe
benefits.
that
is
not
in
this
case
and
i
would
say
that
it's
a
question
of
policy.
a
board
should
not
order
fringe
benefits
even
in
back
case.
the
board
should
reach
the
threshold
question.
if
i
may
say,
it
has
the
act
been
violated.
and
then
as
the
court
so
required
to
do,
leave
to
an
arbitrator
that
he
cite
what
the
provisions
are,
what
the
employer
should
do
and
then
what
the
union
should
do
of
them
in
the
threshold
question.
in
your
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
reinstate
the
employees
and
labor
arbitrator
decide
the
fringe
benefits.
to
me,
a
question
of
policy
is
among
orally
ways
to
effectuate
policies
of
the
act
which
are
to
have
the
parties
decide
through
a
system
of
arbitration
under
section
203
(d).
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
was
refusing
to
sign
the
contract
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
section
8(d).
it's
a5
but
also
it's
8(d)
of
the
act
specifically
states
that
they
signed
the
contract
that
has
been
agreed
to.
i
know
if
you
will
agree
with
the
board
that
they
were
bound
of
this
association
and
it
was
agreed
to
under
8(d)
of
the
act,
the
employer
was
(voice
overlap)
to
sign
the
contract.
excuse
me.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
that
the
union
could
have
brought
the
301
action
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
we're
relying
on
that
but
obviously
under
(voice
overlap)
the
evening
news
there
is
contract
jurisdiction.
i
believe
in
that
case,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
the
court
said
there
will
going
to
be
problems
over
the
fact.
there's
concurrent
jurisdiction
and
this
is
one
of
those
problems
but
we're
accepting
that.
we're
not
suggesting
this
meant
where
as
the
evening
news
goes.
you
overruled
by
any
means
and
there
is
contract
jurisdiction
in
the
case
like
this.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
between
arbitration
and
the
labor
board
or
court
to
compel
arbitration
to
go
to
the
labor
board.
the
arguments
against?
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
evening
news
merely
decided
that
a
section
301
action
would
lack
and
did
not
decide
the
question
of
the
power
of
the
labor
board
to
interpret
the
breached
contract
and
congress
had
before
to
see
when
the
taftâ€“hartley
act
was
passed
the
proposal.
but
the
labor
board
being
given
the
power
that
the
breach
of
a
contract
was
an
unfair
labor
practice,
congress
refused
to
pass
that
portion
of
the
statute
and
we
think
that
is
evidenced
of
a
congressional
purpose
not
to
give
the
board
jurisdiction
over
matters
like
this
where
they
have
to
get
into
and
i
--
just
a
moment.
i
get
to
the
items
that
they
are
going
to
have
into
this.
this
is
not
just
the
question
of
calculating
benefits.
they're
going
to
have
to
interpret
this
agreement.
and
we
submit
that
that's
for
an
arbitrator
to
do.
now,
let's
get
to
the
arguments
that
the
board
had
made
that
it
is
a
windfall
here
to
the
employer.
that
is
not
correct,
may
it
please
the
court
as
we
read
the
enterprise
case
which
was
one
of
the
trilogy
and
which
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
had
expired,
which
agreements
or
disputes
had
arose
at
these
employers
obligated
to
arbitrate
today;
obligated
to
arbitrate
now
the
question
of
fringe
benefits.
and
the
only
reason
the
employer
has
not
signed
the
agreement
the
employer
has
not
yet
signed
the
agreement
if
they
could
have
offered
to
and
the
regional
director
said,well,
why
don't
you
wait
until
that
supreme
court
decides
and
then
we'll
give
in
the
compliance.
the
employer
is
ready
to
sign
and
will
sign
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
this
matter,
of
course,
tell
that
employer
was
found
obligated
to
the
contract,
had
never
reasoned.
that
was
the
employer's
first
assessment.
but
right
now,
under
the
contract
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
no,
sir,
that
is
not
correct.
let
me
first
draw
the,
starting
on
page
62
and
63
of
the
record,
list
the
fringe
benefits.
they
might
be
subject
to
cut
duration
although
it's
a
fairly
complicated
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
i'm
sure
you
realize.
but
on
page
71,
this
is
the
first
place,
it
lists
a
series
of
penalties
that
will
happen
to
an
employer
if
he
does
not
pay
the
fringe
benefits.
and
there
it
says,
paragraph
f,
a
contract
here
may
be
absorbed
of
any
or
all
foregoing
liabilities
if
he
satisfies
the
trustees
if
he
has
failed
to
pay
any
contributions
or
to
report
because
of
honest
mistake
in
the
contribution's,
clerical
error,
or
other
reasons
satisfactory
now.
the
labor
board
shouldn't
decide
whether
under
these
circumstances
the
employer
should
not
have
to
pay
these
penalties
because
of
honest
mistake
that
he
was
obligated.
the
labor
board
should
not
decide
that.
the
arbitrator
opt
to
decide
that.
the
arbitrator
might
well
decide
here.
excuse
me.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
it's
correct.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
board
has
in
mind
at
all,
mr.
chief
justice
fortas.
the
board
has
in
mind
going
to
the
compliance
officer
in
region
21
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
letting
him
decide
whether
we
have
a
good
faith
in
that.
they
don't
have
in
mind
going
to
the
trustee?
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
pay
to
the
appropriate
source
any
fringe
benefits
provided
for
in
the
above-described
contract?
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
as
far
as
the
appropriate
source
under
the
direction
of
the
compliance
officer
of
the
board,
i
don't
believe
they
are
going
to
permit
the
trustees
or
an
arbitrator
to
this
stage
or
leave
us
of
the
payment
again
in
these
benefits
if
they
find
for
example
that
we
should
have
to
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
oh!
no,
it's
paid
to
the
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
it's
paid
to
the
appropriate
source
of
a
trust
fund.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
the
trust
fund.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that's
right.
but
their
different
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
what
it
says
is
in
accordance
with
the
agreement.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that's
right
and
i'm
sure
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
think
we
have
if
i
now
in
practice
one
of
--
i've
never
heard
of
anyone
other
than
the
board
compliance
officer
having
anything
to
do
with
disputes
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
board
order
in
any
other
back
pay
proceeding.
this
is
another
policy,
the
reason
why
we
suggest
that
the
--
ought
to
be
the
law.
this
is
not
the
end
of
this
matter.
there's
going
to
be
some
disputes
here.
i
think
what
will
happen
(inaudible)
indication
is
if
we
don't
agree
with
the
compliance
officer,
we
will
go
to
a
back
pay
hearing.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
before
the
board;
that's
before
the
board.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
a
back
pay?
let
the
board
speak
but
my
practice
has
been
that
a
trial
examiner
on
the
labor
board
will
be
heard.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
don't
think
so.
that
is
as
long
as
this
order
is
in
effect
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
as
long
as
this
order
is
in
effect,
it's
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
and
the
compliance
practices
of
the
board.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
has
taken
the
place?
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
don't
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that's
their
position
as
my
understanding,
mr.
justice
black.
they
can
speak
to
that
but
that's
my
understanding
that
it
will
be
the
board,
in
any
wage
case,
as
mr.
justice
warren
stated,
an
ordinary
discharge
for
union
activity
case
and
you
have
a
dispute
with
the
board
about
how
much
you
owe
that
person,
that
dispute
is
solved.
and
a
back
pay
here
before
another
representative
of
the
labor
board
and
you
have
another
case.
that
goes
up
now.
that's
why,
we
say
that
right
now
is
the
time
to
not
enforce
this
portion
of
the
order
at
this
time
but
leave
the
parties
to
enforce
it
either
themselves.
may
be
the
parties
will
get
together
and
agree
how
much
is
do
and
resolve
this
whole
thing.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
what
we
expect
to
get
by
an
(voice
overlap)
arbitrator
is
just
this
kind
of
back
pay,
mr.
justice
black.
this
is
a
small
employer.
he
thought
he
could
not
compete
and
meet
the
union
wage
scale.
and
that's
exactly
the
story
and
we
tried
to
get
out
of
the
union
and
he
got
jobs
that
he
probably
wouldn't
have
gotten,
wouldn't
have
obtained
if
he
had
to
pay
all
the
conditions
and
so
forth.
now,
we
think
that
is
a
factor
that
an
arbitrator
would
take
into
consideration
that?
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
might
well
here
because
his
employees
were
not
union
employees.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
sir.
as
we
stated
--
and
an
arbitrator
you
can
look
at
production,
productivity.
he
can
look
at
all
sorts
of
things
that
a
court
and
a
board
can.
that's
the
purpose
for
the
trilogy
as
mr.
justice
douglas
brought
it.
that
was
the
purpose
of
it.
an
arbitrator,
in
the
rule
of
common
law,
in
the
rules
of
the
(inaudible)
so
far
to
arrive
at
the
decision
that
the
court
or
the
labor
board
would
not
arrive
at.
and
then
this
is
what
we
think.
here
there's
an
equitable
argument
here.
this
man
would
not
have
hold
these
fringe
benefits
if
he
had
gotten
the
jobs
and
the
only
reason
he
got
to
work,
put
on
the
rules,
was
because
he
didn't
have
to
pay
these
fringe
benefits.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that's
right.
now,
this
penalty
they
might
issue
and
have
to
pay
this
because
it
was
an
honest
fall,
that
is
not
a
false
act
to
try
to
destroy
the
union
a
little
of
what
it
was
and
some
other
and
further
operation.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i've
never
known
that,
mr.
justice
black.
(voice
overlap)
i've
never
known
that
the
board
in
compliance
proceeding
doing
anything
but
determining
the
matter
for
themselves
in
the
board
and
can
speaks
for
itself.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
its'
normally
done
in
the
context
of
the
back
pay
hearing
without
official
--.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
don't
have
that
confidence
in
the
board,
mr.
justice
brennan
when
in
these
cases
like
i
just
read
adams
jerry
and
so
are
they,
they
looked
at
the
agreement.
they
say,
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
does
not
contain
a
subcontracting
clause,
then
there's
nothing
to
arbitrate.
that
is
directly
contrary
to
that,
mr.
justice
douglas.
this
decision
in
the
trilogy
directly
contrary
to
it.
the
labor
board,
in
all
due
respect,
is
competent
in
determining
whether
unfair
labor
practice
is,
it
has
very
little
competence
and
has
evidence
to
it
by
these
recent
cases
in
one
of
breach
of
contract
is
in
this
area.
excuse
me,
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
a
very
low
competence
in
interpreting
competence,
in
interpreting
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
this
is
the
system
that
we
are
under,
mr.
justice
black.
when
you
have
a
contract
that
has
a
monetary
arbitration
clause,
you're
under
the
system
and
i
guess
it's
been
very
few
times
that
an
employer
stood
before
this
court
and
contended
for
arbitrability.
but
were
here
and
were
so
contending
because
we
are
accepting
the
principle.
we
shouldn't
have
to
have
two
proceedings;
we're
going
to
have
another
proceeding.
now,
there
are
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
was
about
to
say
there
are
--
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
no
it
would
not
because
an
arbitrator
still
could
be
able
to
say,
as
i
mentioned
under
this
circumstances,
i'm
going
to
say
that
equity
dictates
at
the
employer
not
have
to
pay
even
though
it
was
trickily
calculated.
you
see,
before
the
trilogy.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
it
would
be
the
same.
excuse
me,
i
must
have
misspoke
that.
our
argument
would
be
the
same
as
it
is
now.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
this
court
has
so
held.
this
court
and
nothing
down
the
cutler
hammer
doctrine
which
said
that
you
couldn't
arbitrate
a
dispute
if
the
language
was
clear
and
unambiguous.
this
court
knocked
that
doctrine
down
and
correctly
so
even
though
the
language
is
clear
and
unambiguous.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
the
parties
have
contracted
even
though
the
language
is
maybe
clear
and
unambiguous.
the
parties
have
contracted
to
have
an
arbitrator
decide
this.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that's
right.
that's
entirely
possible,
mr.
justice
black,
entirely
possible
on
the
labor
context.
entirely
possible
and
yet
it's
not
clear
here.
let
me
say
that
--
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct,
that
position
was
there.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
well,
we've
offered
the
same,
mr.
justice
marshall.
somebody
had
to
decide.
there
is
a
serious
question
here
in
the
statute's
limitation.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
it
was
up
to
the
expert.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
that
is
correct.
but
it's
up
to
the
union,
mr.
justice
marshall.
they
could
have
filed
a
grievance
and
they
could
have
gone
to
arbitration
and
they
could
have
compelled
us
to
do
so.
we
had,
as
i
said
earlier,
the
labor
board
decide,
can
decide
here
the
threshold
question.
was
there
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
refusing
to
sign
the
contract?
that
doesn't
mean
they
have
to
take
the
case
for
all
purposes.
fabricated
proceedings
are
nothing
new
to
this
court.
that's
what
is
count
by
the
trilogy.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
correct.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
nothing
unusual
about
that.
that's
correct.
there's
nothing
unusual
about
that.
that
what
happens
if
an
employer
contends
a
dispute
is
not
subject
to
arbitration.
under
the
agreement,
the
court
first
determines
whether
it
is
and
if
it
determines
that
it
is,
you
don't
have
an
arbitration.
we're
going
to
have
that
hearing,
mr.
justice
black,
because
i'm
sure
there's
going
to
be
a
back
pay
hearing
in
this
case
because
there
are
questions
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
to
meaning
and
intent.
it
says
there
are
certain
penalties
for
the
non-payment
of
health
and
welfare
benefits
yet
it
says
a
contract
too
an
important
and
may
be
absorbed
if
he
is
in
good
faith.
and,
somebody
is
going
to
determine
whether
we
have
to
pay
these
penalties
or
not.
there
are
provisions
here
about
hours
of
work.
that
may
well
be
a
fringe
benefit.
well,
i
don't
know
what
a
fringe
benefit
is
and
i'm
sure
you
can
make
a
good
argument
that
hours
of
work
is
a
fringe
benefit.
what
about
if
it
says
work
must
be
done
outside
the
regular
working
hours
for
the
protection
of
life
or
property?
the
labor
board
cannot
decide
that
back
pay
here?
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
if
the
labor
board
permits
the
arbitrator
to
determine
this,
yes,
sir.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
i
think
that's
what
law
would
be.
in
arbitration
there's
no
misunderstanding.
in
that
arbitration,
we
would
contend
that
even
though
it
says
7
cents
an
hour,
the
health
and
welfare
because
of
this
equitable
considerations
which
shouldn't
have
paid
any.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
it
would
be
very
surprised,
mr.
justice
fortas,
that
the
court
will
overrule
an
arbitrator.
if
he
rules
on
our
favor,
we
would
have
to
take
what
is
the
decision.
mr.
charles
g.
bakaly,
jr.
of
what
this
court
said.
there's
some
other
provisions
but
from
labor
board
he's
going
to
in
this
case
after
interpreting
this
collective
bargaining
agreement.
we
think
that
that
is
for
the
arbitrator
to
do
and
it
would
be
an
orally
procedure.
there's
not
going
to
be
unneeded
bifurcation.
the
policy
of
the
act
as
counsel
here
has
said
[coughing],
also
as
a
section
in
section
203
(d)
the
final
adjustment
by
a
method
agreed
upon
by
the
parties
is
hereby
declared
to
be
desirable
method
for
settlement/agreement
of
disputes.
and,
we
submit
that
a
threshold
question?
fine,
but
the
labor
board
decides
or
a
court
concurrent
jurisdiction.
once
the
labor
board
has
decided
there's
a
contract,
then
let's
have
all
of
the
contract
be
applicable
including
the
grievance
and
arbitration
provisions
of
the
agreement.
thank
you.
