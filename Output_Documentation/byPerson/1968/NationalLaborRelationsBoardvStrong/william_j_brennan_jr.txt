justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
is
it
not
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
you
said
something
earlier,
mr.
weinstein
that
that
issue
had
been
resolved
by
the
denial
here
set
unsolved
and
some
other
case
however?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
he
is
never
been
attempted
--
nobody
has
attempted
to
bring
that
issue
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you
tried
to
bring
it
here
and
we
refused
service,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
how
did
this
get
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
first
thing
has
to
be
done,
and
this
is
how
i
read
it,
is
that
they
submit
it
to
the
trustees.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
trustees,
are
trained
that
--
i
don't
know.
what
is
this
set
up
here.
the
trustees
opponent
by
the
both
union
and
management?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
question
really
was,
in
a
back
pay
hearing
it
might
not
be
a
determination
of
the
amount
do
in
a
way
of
fringe
benefit
which
might
take
into
account
some
of
the
things
which
you
think
an
arbitrator
will?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
just
asked
you
what
you
said
by
a
little
contract?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

is
it
