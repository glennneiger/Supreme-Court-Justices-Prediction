section
811
(c)
(1)
(b)
of
the
1939
internal
revenue
code
under
which
the
government
seeks
to
impose
a
tax
in
this
case
authorizes
inclusion
in
the
taxable
estate
of
a
decedent
of
property
and
i
believe
that
the
language
of
the
statute
is
important
in
imposing
a
tax
when
it
described
the
transaction
to
which
the
tax
applies.
it
says
to
the
property
to
the
extent
of
any
interest
therein
of
which
the
decedent
has
made
a
transfer
under
which
he
has
retained
a
life
estate.
now,
this
law
clearly
permits
and
has
always
been
held
to
permit
any
husband
to
place
property
in
trust
for
his
wife
for
life
with
remainder
to
their
children
and
that
trust
would
not
be
subject
to
estate
tax
on
the
death
of
the
wife
because
she
only
had
a
life
estate
in
it
and
it
was
not
a
retained
life
estate.
the
same
is
true
of
any
wife.
there
is
certainly
no
discrimination
on
account
of
sex
on
this
statute.
any
wife
may
create
a
trust
for
the
benefit
of
her
husband
for
life
with
remainder
to
their
children
and
that
trust
is
not
taxable
on
the
death
of
the
life
tenant.
now,
here
the
government
is
trying
to
tax
a
trust
on
the
death
of
the
life
tenant
to
the
life
tenant's
estate.
it
tries
to
justify
that
position
by
reliance
on
the
lehman
case
and
the
many
other
cases
following
and
yet
in
the
lehman
case
which
involved
a
clear
case
of
this
economic
equivalence
of
the
two
trusts
where
two
brothers
that
each
had
a
half
interest
in
certain
securities,
each
transferred
their
half
interest
reportedly
in
trust
for
the
other
brother
and
his
children
and
there
was
no
way
to
tell
which
half
interest
went
into
each
trust
except
that
papers
said
so.
now,
--
mr.
william
s.
downard
i
think
that
is
the
--
the
critical
thing
in
this
case,
your
honor.
there
was
none.
now,
let
us
go
into
the
actual
facts
of
this
case
and
how
they
will
not
tally
with
the
government's
argument
that
substance
must
prevail
over
form.
that's
what
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
let
substance
prevail
over
form
and
the
substance
of
these
trusts
was
quite
different.
now,
the
property
that
the
wife
transferred
to
the
trust
that
the
government
now
seeks
to
include
in
the
decedent's
estate
consisted
of
the
family
homestead
which
was
a
large
167-acre
estate
on
long
island
that
had
a
big
expensive
65-room
mansion
on
it.
that
property
had
originally
been
given
to
the
wife
back
in
1911
and
she
had
owned
it
for
20
years
before
she
created
this
trust
with
it.
in
that
trust
with
the
homestead
property
she
placed
40
shares
of
stock
in
a
personal
holding
company
which
were
calculated
to
be
the
amount
of
stock
necessary
to
produce
enough
dividends
to
pay
the
local
ad
valorem
taxes
on
the
homestead
property
just
as
support
for
the
homestead.
so
essentially,
the
nature
of
the
trust
that
the
wife
created
and
that
the
government
now
seeks
to
tax
to
the
decedent's
estate
was
purely
noncommercial
interest
in
a
homestead
and
by
virtue
of
a
creation
of
that
trust,
the
court
of
claims
found
that
there
was
no
change
whatever
in
the
possession,
use
or
enjoyment
of
the
property
so
that
there
was
and
that
none
was
intended
and
in
fact
as
noted
in
the
government's
brief
in
the
footnote,
the
decedent
did
immediately
after
the
creation
of
this
wife's
trust
exercise
a
power
of
appointment
that
he
had
to
appoint
it
back
to
her
for
her
life
and
specifically
provided
that
she
would
then
have
the
successive
life
estate
in
case
he
predeceased
her.
and
so
the
net
economic
effect
of
this
non-economic
trust
was
really
certainly
nothing
equivalent
to
the
trust
that
the
decedent
created.
now,
in
the
decedent's
trust
that
he
created
15
days
earlier
he
transferred
a
variety
of
commercial
investment
properties
held
for
a
long
term
appreciation
in
value.
there
was
a
thousand
acre
track
of
land
down
in
a
remote
section
of
long
island
and
there
was
a
stock
of
two
real
estate
development
corporations,
and
there
was
a
one-fourth
interest
in
a
real
estate
development
joint
venture
and
there
were
sure
a
lot
of
pieces
of
real
estate.
most
of
these
properties
have
been
inherited
by
the
decedent
but
he
transferred
to
that
estate
commercial
investment
properties
that
had
a
financial
significance
and
certainly
in
as
a
result
of
the
creation
by
his
wife
of
this
trust
placing
the
homestead
in
trust
as
a
device
for
preserving
it
and
maintaining
it
for
the
family
and
their
children,
the
decedent
didn't
get
any
sort
of
economic
equivalence.
in
reality,
nothing
was
taken
away
from
janet
grace
and
nothing
was
given
to
the
decedent.
he
had
always
--
he
had
lived
in
that
home
for
20
years
at
the
severance
of
his
wife
who
owned
it.
he
was
going
to
live
there
the
rest
of
his
life
no
matter
whether
it
was
put
in
trust
or
not.
and
as
far
as
any
real
substance
and
effect
is
concerned,
the
janet
grace
trust
accomplished
nothing
that
could
not
have
been
accomplished
had
she
provided
a
testamentary
life
estate
in
her
will
for
husband
for
life
and
then
to
the
children.
had
she
done
so,
this
decedent's
estate
would
not
be
taxable
on
the
expiration
of
his
life
estate,
the
statute
doesn't
so
provide.
it
could
have
been
done
in
perhaps
a
dozen
different
ways.
it
so
happened
that
this
decedent
because
he
was
a
very
trust-minded
man,
because
he
had
created
26
trusts
for
his
children
in
the
10
years
before
this,
and
he
was
convinced
that
trusts
were
a
good
way
to
do
things,
he
happened
to
select
this
way
of
doing
it,
this
trust
instrument
and
it
just
happened
that
because
he
was
creating
this
other
financial
trust
for
the
security
of
his
wife
and
children.
at
the
same
time,
he
used
the
same
format
trust
instrument
but
the
similarity
informs
of
the
trust
instrument
is
purely
a
superficial
matter
of
form
and
it
seems
to
me
paradoxical
that
the
solicitor
general
argues
that
substance
must
prevail
over
form
and
that
we
must
give
recognition
to
the
economic
substance
without
ever
facing
up
to
the
fact
of
what
the
economic
substance
of
these
trusts
really
are.
and
in
any
real
sense
of
economic
substance,
there
simply
was
no
equivalence
between
the
two
trusts
that
were
created.
no
equivalence
of
even
the
same
character
of
estates
or
economic
significance
of
these
estates
that
were
created
by
these
trusts.
mr.
william
s.
downard
your
honor,
she
died
in
1937.
the
lehman
case
was
decided
in
1940.
in
--
when
her
estate
was
under
examination
in
about
1943,
must
i
stop
now?
mr.
william
s.
downard
when
--
when
her
estate
was
under
examination
in
1943,
there
was
a
contention
that
the
trust
should
be
taxed
as
reciprocal
manner.
here
is
where
the
revenue
service
--
if
we
really
thought
these
were
reciprocal
trusts
could
have
taxed
joseph
grace's
trust
to
janet
grace's
estate.
it
didn't
do
that.
they
compromised
--
they
entered
into
a
compromised
agreement
whereby
55%
of
the
janet
grace
trust
was
included
in
janet's
estate
and
in
this
case
they
are
trying
to
include
it
again
in
joseph's
estate
and
impose
two
estate
taxes
on
the
same
trust
and
no
case
has
ever
held
that
the
reciprocal
trust
doctrine
should
result
in
double
taxation.
mr.
william
s.
downard
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
want
to
digress
a
moment
before
continuing
my
argument
on
the
merits
of
the
case
to
take
out
the
point
mentioned
by
the
solicitor
general
on
the
serious
question
of
jurisdiction.
we
strongly
believe
that
this
petition
was
out
obtained.
it
was
filed
on
the
160th
day
after
this
decision
was
printed
and
announced
by
the
court
of
claims
formally
a
55
page
document
which
contains
as
the
solicitor
general
read
to
you
a
statement
that
the
findings
of
fact
which
are
made
as
part
of
the
judgment
herein.
the
basic
court's
conclusion
that
the
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
recover
and
state's
judgment
is
entered
to
that
effect
and
a
docket
entry
was
made
that
judgment
was
entered
on
that
day.
the
findings
of
fact
which
are
incorporated
expressly
in
the
judgment
state
the
amounts
and
date
from
which
interest
runs,
everything
necessary
to
determine
the
amount.
there
had
never
been
any
question
as
to
the
amount
and
it
was
routinely
stipulated
and
a
subsequent
one-page
typewritten
order
entered
that
merely
confirmed
the
amount
as
shown
in
the
original
findings
of
fact
that
were
made
back
on
april
19,
1968
and
that
should
be
the
time
from
which
the
time
runs
for
filing
a
petition
according
to
all
of
the
standards
set
forth
in
this
court's
case
as
such
as
minneapolis-honeywell
and
the
schaefer
brewing
case
and
the
last
case
i
believe
which
the
court
has
addressed
itself
specifically
to
a
court
of
claims
case
of
this
sort
was
the
adams
case
cited
in
the
government's
brief
in
response
and
that
case
clearly
indicated
that
a
second
judgment
unless
it
were
inextricably
leaned
with
the
issue
dealt
within
the
first
judgment
that
sought
to
be
reviewed
is
not
the
measuring
time
from
which
the
time
for
filing
a
petition
begins.
well,
after
that
digression
let
me
get
back
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
the
solicitor
general
has
presented
the
court
with
the
paradox
that
while
he
concedes
that
consideration
must
be
interpreted
in
the
light
of
the
actual
facts
of
the
case,
he
has
not
come
to
grips
with
the
actual
facts
of
the
case
as
found
by
the
court
of
claims,
instead
referring
only
to
certain
language
out
of
the
dissenting
opinion.
the
dissenting
judge
simply
did
not
agree
with
the
facts
as
found
by
the
court
and
the
court
did
find
the
facts
and
the
facts
as
found
by
the
court
should
be
accepted
as
the
facts
of
this
case.
those
facts
pertinent
to
the
question
of
whether
these
trusts
were
created
in
consideration
of
each
other
which
has
always
been
the
tests
are
as
follows
and
they
are
not
purely
subjective
facts.
there
are
objective
facts
set
forth
in
detail
in
the
record
detailing
a
long
history
of
gifts
by
this
decedent
of
large
and
valuable
properties
not
inconsequential
gifts.
they
were
properties
worth
considerable
sums
of
money
that
he
had
given
to
his
wife.
he
had
made
one
or
more
such
gifts
either
to
his
wife
or
in
trust
for
his
children
in
every
year
over
25
year
period
from
1917
to
1942
with
the
exception
of
the
year
1921
and
except
that
for
the
few
years
immediately
after
the
creation
of
these
trusts
in
december
1931
he
didn't
create
any
trust.
the
obvious
reason
being
that
in
this
december
1931
trust,
as
shown
by
the
evidence
and
found
by
the
court,
he
was
anticipating
the
enactment
of
a
gift
tax
law
in
1932.
there
was
no
gift
tax
at
that
time
and
the
gift
tax
law
was
indeed
enacted
in
1932
and
the
only
stated
reason
for
the
decedent's
acting
at
this
particular
time
was
the
fact
that
he
heard
the
gift
tax
law
was
going
to
be
enacted
and
he
said
anything
further
i
am
going
to
do
in
my
program
of
giving
--
i
should
do
before
the
gift
tax
comes
in
because
if
i
postpone
it
i
have
to
pay
for
a
gift
tax.
if
i
go
ahead
and
do
it
now,
i
won't
have
to
and
that
is
not
an
evil
tax
avoidance
motive.
it's
just
as
a
man
of
common
sense
saying
i've
been
giving
away
probably
all
my
life
and
this
is
my
means
of
expressing
my
affection
to
my
dependent
loved
ones
and
if
i
postpone
it
i
will
have
to
pay
additional
taxes
so
why
wait.
so
he
was
anxious
to
go
ahead
and
do
it
and
this
is
the
full
explanation
of
the
reason
that
these
two
trusts
happened
to
have
been
created
at
the
same
time
because
he
was
anxious
to
get
things
done
before
this
gift
tax
came
in.
certainly,
if
these
two
transactions
have
been
done
with
different
forms
as
easily
they
could
have
been
or
if
they
had
been
done
at
different
times
if
the
decedent
had
carried
out
his
program
of
giving
in
his
usual
manner
and
given
away
one
of
these
properties
in
1931
and
another
one
in
1932
and
another
one
in
1933
and
another
in
1934
and
so
forth.
and
if
janet
grace
at
any
other
time
had
placed
her
homestead
in
trust
to
preserve
and
maintain
it
for
her
family
and
children
nobody
would
say
that
these
trusts
are
reciprocal.
it's
purely
the
superficial
appearance
created
by
the
time
that
gives
the
government
any
argument
that
these
trusts
have
any
appearance
similar
to
those
that
have
been
held
reciprocal
in
any
cases.
and
that
factor
of
timing
is
fully
explained
by
the
decedent's
anticipation
of
the
gift
tax
law.
certainly,
that
fact
that
this
is
concerned
about
gift
tax
law
was
his
prime
worry
at
the
time
merely
serves
to
emphasize
that
these
trusts
really
were
donative
in
nature
and
he
certainly
considered
that
he
was
making
a
gift
or
he
wouldn't
have
been
worried
about
the
gift
tax
if
he
thought
that
he
was
making
some
exchange
for
considerations
with
his
wife.
but
the
court
has
expressly
tried
this
case
through
a
long
trial
in
a
very
comprehensive
record
in
analysis
of
the
facts
and
the
trier
of
facts
has
determined
that
these
word
gratuitous
gifts
that
were
made.
the
solicitor
general
has
indicated
that
consideration
should
not
be
the
test
in
this
case
and
yet
his
argument
is
based
on
cases
such
as
the
lehman
case
that
is
expressly
based
on
consideration.
the
lehman
case
was
certainly
was
one
in
which
the
court
could
have
completely
admitted
to
consideration
test
and
just
said
well,
the
economic
substance
of
these
transactions
is
the
same
as
if
each
the
brother
had
created
a
trust
for
himself
but
it
didn't
stop
there.
the
lehman
case
went
on
to
say
and
to
point
out
that
this
was
not
the
significant
point
and
said
that
the
decisive
point
in
this
case
is
that
by
transferring
his
own
property
to
his
brother,
he
caused
his
brother
to
make
his
brother
to
make
the
other
trust
for
his
benefit
and
then
it
went
on
to
talk
about
consideration
and
quid
pro
quo.
now,
the
solicitor
general
has
picked
up
only
one
phrase
out
of
that
sentence
he
said.
in
the
lehman
case,
one
brother
caused
the
other
brother
to
make
the
trust.
but
it
wanted
the
fact
that
he
caused
him
to
make
the
trust
by
asking
him
to,
requesting
him
to,
suggesting
that
he
do
it
or
advising
that
he
do
it,
or
planning
the
trust
instruments,
the
case
specifically
said
that
by
transferring
his
own
property
he
caused
it
and
then
in
the
hanauer
case
in
the
second
circuit
which
followed
on
the
lehman
case,
the
second
circuit
explained
and
reiterated
that
it
was
furnishing
of
a
consideration
or
a
quid
pro
quo
whereby
transferring
his
own
property
the
decedent
had
caused
the
other
transfer
to
be
made
and
so
the
consideration
test
is
a
causation
test
but
it's
a
causation
test
based
on
whether
one
transfer
of
property
causes
another
transfer
of
property.
it
is
not
a
question
of
whether
one
person
such
as
a
husband
causes
a
donor
to
make
a
gift
to
him
by
requesting
it.
a
donor
is
nonetheless
a
donor
and
a
donee
is
nonetheless
a
donee
simply
because
the
donee
requests,
suggests,
advises,
recommends,
wheedles,
or
cajoles.
if
a
son
asks
his
father
to
give
him
a
piece
of
property
because
he
wants
it,
if
the
father
gives
it
to
him
it's
still
a
gift.
if
a
husband
asks
his
wife
or
plans
and
arranges
for
his
wife
to
give
him
a
piece
of
property
and
puts
a
deed
in
front
of
her,
she
owns
the
property
and
it's
only
she
that
has
the
right
to
say
no
i
won't
give
it
or
yes
i
will
and
all
she
has
to
do
to
make
a
transfer
in
terms
of
the
estate
tax
and
the
gift
tax
is
to
sign
that
deed
and
that's
what
janet
grace
did.
you
may
draw
an
analogy
to
the
community
property
situation
where
a
husband
is
a
sole
manager
of
a
community
with
the
right
to
dispose
of
it
even
without
his
wife's
knowledge
or
consent
and
if
he
does
give
it
away,
and
she
owned
a
half
interest
in
it
and
that
half
interest
passes
to
somebody
else
even
without
her
knowledge
and
consent
it's
held
that
she
made
a
taxable
gift
for
gift
tax
purposes,
for
estate
tax
purposes,
it
may
be
a
gift
in
contemplation
of
debt,
and
yet
she
has
nothing
to
say
about
it
and
so
the
government's
argument
that
the
wife
because
the
wife
was
merely
compliant
or
acquiescent
to
her
husband's
wishes,
somehow
means
that
she
didn't
make
a
transfer
of
her
property
to
this
trust
seems
aside
from
the
point
and
contrary
to
the
whole
established
concepts
of
stating
gift
taxes.
mr.
william
s.
downard
your
honor,
this
case
was
originally
filed
in
1959.
i
tried
the
case
i
was
employed
in
1962.
it
had
been
through
various
stages
of
pretrial.
the
pretrial
proceedings
in
the
court
of
claims
were
extremely
elaborate
and
very
detailed.
i
was
employed
in
1962
and
the
latter
part
of
1962.
i
tried
the
case
in
the
summer
of
1963
after
a
more
elaborate
pretrial
proceedings,
the
case
then
went
up
to
the
--
it
takes
a
long
time
because
you
have
to
--
the
trial
commissioner
sets
like
a
district
judge
and
he
makes
a
decision
which
is
then
automatically
reviewed
by
the
judges
of
the
court
much
like
an
appeal
so
you
have
to
submit
briefs
to
the
commissioner.
he
then
has
to
take
time
to
make
his
decision
and
recommendation
and
that
goes
up
to
the
court
and
after
this
case
went
up
to
the
court
of
claims,
i
believe
in
1965,
they
remanded
it
for
a
further
trial
because
the
government
argued
that
the
whole
essence
of
the
case
was
that
the
decedent
created
these
trusts
for
tax
avoidance
motives
and
the
court
was
interested
in
that
and
said,
"well,
now
if
these
were
a
tax
avoidance
device
that
may
affect
our
disposition
of
the
case"
so
they
remanded
it
for
a
further
trial
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
decedent
was
motivated
to
avoid
or
lessen
estate
taxes
with
reference
to
the
creation
of
these
trusts.
and
another
full
trial
was
held
and
the
conclusion
of
fact
was
reached
that
there
was
no
motive
gift
taxes
in
this
--
there
was
no
motive
to
avoid
estate
taxes
in
this
case
which
and
that
there
was
no
showing
of
any
motive
of
tax
avoidance
of
any
kind
and
the
evidence
clearly
supported
that
for
the
decedent
created
this
trust
in
a
routine
and
cavalier
fashion
run
down
very
hurriedly
in
december
of
1931
not
considered
for
a
long
time
and
he
never
consulted
any
tax
attorney,
any
tax
adviser
of
any
kind
with
reference
to
the
tax
consequences
of
these
large
trust
that
he
created
which
is
almost
inconceivable
that
a
man
would
create
trust
of
this
size
without
consulting
a
tax
adviser
but
he
did
because
he
wasn't
concerned
about
taxes,
he
was
concerned
about
providing
for
his
dependent
loved
ones
as
he
had
been
doing
all
his
life,
and
the
court
of
claims
found
as
a
fact
that
these
trusts
were
merely
part
of
this
long
pattern
and
history
of
gifts
that
these
parties
have
been
making.
now,
on
the
question
of
what
the
law
is
in
this
case,
the
solicitor
general
read
to
the
court
excerpts
from
the
committee
reports
including
the
following,
however,
in
1914
in
lehman
against
commissioner,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
held
that
where
trusts
are
found
to
have
been
created
each
in
consideration
of
the
other,
the
nominal
grantor
should
be
interchanged
and
then
he
said
right
after
that
there
is
no
reference
to
consideration
in
the
committee
reports,
and
i
ask
you
to
again
read
the
language
that
he
read
to
the
court
which
specifically
does
mention
where
the
trusts
are
found
to
have
been
created
in
consideration
of
each
other
so
congress
was
confronted,
was
fully
apprised
of
and
recognized
the
existence
of
the
consideration
requirement
as
set
forth
in
lehman
and
the
case
is
following
it.
it
shows
not
to
legislate
any
different
rule
and
therefore
accepted
that
rule
and
certainly
the
lehman
rule
that
the
court
that
the
congress
expressly
approved
of
in
the
1949
committee
reports,
when
it
shows
not
to
do
anything
but
grant
some
relief
legislation
was
the
very
test
that
the
court
of
claims
used
in
the
decision
below
and
that
is
as
stated
by
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
moreno
case,
perhaps
one
of
the
most
recent
cases
on
the
subject
that
whether
this
doctrine
applies
is
simply
a
question
of
fact
whether
one
trust
was
created
in
consideration
for
the
other
trust
and
where
trust
have
been
found
not
to
have
been
created
in
consideration
of
each
other
factually,
the
courts
have
held
in
case
after
case
that
the
trusts
are
not
taxable
reciprocal
in
the
absence
of
consideration.
in
case
after
case
which
had
held
trust
taxable
reciprocally,
the
courts
have
clearly
set
forth
the
rule
and
discussed
the
matter
as
a
factual
test
of
whether
these
trusts
were
created
in
consideration
of
each
other.
now,
that
is
what
all
of
the
previous
cases
have
held.
but
even
needing
the
solicitor
general
on
his
own
battleground
and
saying
there
is
no
consideration
test
despite
what
all
the
cases
have
said,
despite
what
congress
said,
let's
assume
there's
no
consideration
test
and
that
we
confront
this
matter
merely
as
a
question
of
whether
the
economic
substance
and
effect
is
the
same
whether
that
the
consequence
is
or
the
same
as
the
solicitor
general
said
as
if
mr.
and
mrs.
grace
had
each
created
a
trust
for
himself
and
when
you
confront
the
realities
and
the
facts
of
this
case,
you
find
that
those
economic
consequences
were
not
the
same
and
could
not
be
the
same
because
of
the
non-equivalence
in
the
whole
nature
of
the
two
different
trusts.
now,
let
me
call
attention
to
one
further
thing
in
even
approaching
the
form
of
these
transactions
as
the
solicitor
general
does
that
in
form
even
these
trust
were
not
reciprocal
and
non-reciprocating
in
their
taxable
incidents
for
in
each
trust,
the
settlor
named
himself
as
trustee
and
retained
a
taxable
power
to
terminate
the
trust
by
distributing
it
to
the
life
tenant
at
any
time.
these
parties
did
not
carry
out
the
reciprocal
trusts
arrangement
of
giving
taxable
powers
to
each
other
rather
each
one
kept
the
clearly
taxable
for
himself
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
lober
and
holmes
cases
cited
in
our
briefs,
those
trusts
would
be
taxable
each
to
the
settlor
that
created
it
and
janet
grace's
trust
should
have
been
taxed
to
janet's
estate.
we
admit
that
it
was
taxed
to
her
estate.
now,
the
government
is
trying
to
tax
it
again.
the
joseph
grace
trust
would
have
been
taxed
to
his
estate
except
that
that
trust
terminated
and
passed
irrevocably
and
outright
to
his
children.
in
1937
when
his
wife
died
and
the
only
reason
he's
not
taxable
on
the
property
that
went
into
that
trust
is
that
it
vested
in
the
children
passed
irrevocably
from
him
in
1937,
13
years
before
he
died
and
should
not
be
taxed
to
his
estate
nor
should
anything
be
taxed
in
lieu
of
it.

section
811
(c)
(1)
(b)
of
the
1939
internal
revenue
code
under
which
the
government
seeks
to
impose
a
tax
in
this
case
authorizes
inclusion
in
the
taxable
estate
of
a
decedent
of
property
and
i
believe
that
the
language
of
the
statute
is
important
in
imposing
a
tax
when
it
described
the
transaction
to
which
the
tax
applies.
it
says
to
the
property
to
the
extent
of
any
interest
therein
of
which
the
decedent
has
made
a
transfer
under
which
he
has
retained
a
life
estate.
now,
this
law
clearly
permits
and
has
always
been
held
to
permit
any
husband
to
place
property
in
trust
for
his
wife
for
life
with
remainder
to
their
children
and
that
trust
would
not
be
subject
to
estate
tax
on
the
death
of
the
wife
because
she
only
had
a
life
estate
in
it
and
it
was
not
a
retained
life
estate.
the
same
is
true
of
any
wife.
there
is
certainly
no
discrimination
on
account
of
sex
on
this
statute.
any
wife
may
create
a
trust
for
the
benefit
of
her
husband
for
life
with
remainder
to
their
children
and
that
trust
is
not
taxable
on
the
death
of
the
life
tenant.
now,
here
the
government
is
trying
to
tax
a
trust
on
the
death
of
the
life
tenant
to
the
life
tenant's
estate.
it
tries
to
justify
that
position
by
reliance
on
the
lehman
case
and
the
many
other
cases
following
and
yet
in
the
lehman
case
which
involved
a
clear
case
of
this
economic
equivalence
of
the
two
trusts
where
two
brothers
that
each
had
a
half
interest
in
certain
securities,
each
transferred
their
half
interest
reportedly
in
trust
for
the
other
brother
and
his
children
and
there
was
no
way
to
tell
which
half
interest
went
into
each
trust
except
that
papers
said
so.
now,
--
mr.
william
s.
downard
i
think
that
is
the
--
the
critical
thing
in
this
case,
your
honor.
there
was
none.
now,
let
us
go
into
the
actual
facts
of
this
case
and
how
they
will
not
tally
with
the
government's
argument
that
substance
must
prevail
over
form.
that's
what
we're
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
let
substance
prevail
over
form
and
the
substance
of
these
trusts
was
quite
different.
now,
the
property
that
the
wife
transferred
to
the
trust
that
the
government
now
seeks
to
include
in
the
decedent's
estate
consisted
of
the
family
homestead
which
was
a
large
167-acre
estate
on
long
island
that
had
a
big
expensive
65-room
mansion
on
it.
that
property
had
originally
been
given
to
the
wife
back
in
1911
and
she
had
owned
it
for
20
years
before
she
created
this
trust
with
it.
in
that
trust
with
the
homestead
property
she
placed
40
shares
of
stock
in
a
personal
holding
company
which
were
calculated
to
be
the
amount
of
stock
necessary
to
produce
enough
dividends
to
pay
the
local
ad
valorem
taxes
on
the
homestead
property
just
as
support
for
the
homestead.
so
essentially,
the
nature
of
the
trust
that
the
wife
created
and
that
the
government
now
seeks
to
tax
to
the
decedent's
estate
was
purely
noncommercial
interest
in
a
homestead
and
by
virtue
of
a
creation
of
that
trust,
the
court
of
claims
found
that
there
was
no
change
whatever
in
the
possession,
use
or
enjoyment
of
the
property
so
that
there
was
and
that
none
was
intended
and
in
fact
as
noted
in
the
government's
brief
in
the
footnote,
the
decedent
did
immediately
after
the
creation
of
this
wife's
trust
exercise
a
power
of
appointment
that
he
had
to
appoint
it
back
to
her
for
her
life
and
specifically
provided
that
she
would
then
have
the
successive
life
estate
in
case
he
predeceased
her.
and
so
the
net
economic
effect
of
this
non-economic
trust
was
really
certainly
nothing
equivalent
to
the
trust
that
the
decedent
created.
now,
in
the
decedent's
trust
that
he
created
15
days
earlier
he
transferred
a
variety
of
commercial
investment
properties
held
for
a
long
term
appreciation
in
value.
there
was
a
thousand
acre
track
of
land
down
in
a
remote
section
of
long
island
and
there
was
a
stock
of
two
real
estate
development
corporations,
and
there
was
a
one-fourth
interest
in
a
real
estate
development
joint
venture
and
there
were
sure
a
lot
of
pieces
of
real
estate.
most
of
these
properties
have
been
inherited
by
the
decedent
but
he
transferred
to
that
estate
commercial
investment
properties
that
had
a
financial
significance
and
certainly
in
as
a
result
of
the
creation
by
his
wife
of
this
trust
placing
the
homestead
in
trust
as
a
device
for
preserving
it
and
maintaining
it
for
the
family
and
their
children,
the
decedent
didn't
get
any
sort
of
economic
equivalence.
in
reality,
nothing
was
taken
away
from
janet
grace
and
nothing
was
given
to
the
decedent.
he
had
always
--
he
had
lived
in
that
home
for
20
years
at
the
severance
of
his
wife
who
owned
it.
he
was
going
to
live
there
the
rest
of
his
life
no
matter
whether
it
was
put
in
trust
or
not.
and
as
far
as
any
real
substance
and
effect
is
concerned,
the
janet
grace
trust
accomplished
nothing
that
could
not
have
been
accomplished
had
she
provided
a
testamentary
life
estate
in
her
will
for
husband
for
life
and
then
to
the
children.
had
she
done
so,
this
decedent's
estate
would
not
be
taxable
on
the
expiration
of
his
life
estate,
the
statute
doesn't
so
provide.
it
could
have
been
done
in
perhaps
a
dozen
different
ways.
it
so
happened
that
this
decedent
because
he
was
a
very
trust-minded
man,
because
he
had
created
26
trusts
for
his
children
in
the
10
years
before
this,
and
he
was
convinced
that
trusts
were
a
good
way
to
do
things,
he
happened
to
select
this
way
of
doing
it,
this
trust
instrument
and
it
just
happened
that
because
he
was
creating
this
other
financial
trust
for
the
security
of
his
wife
and
children.
at
the
same
time,
he
used
the
same
format
trust
instrument
but
the
similarity
informs
of
the
trust
instrument
is
purely
a
superficial
matter
of
form
and
it
seems
to
me
paradoxical
that
the
solicitor
general
argues
that
substance
must
prevail
over
form
and
that
we
must
give
recognition
to
the
economic
substance
without
ever
facing
up
to
the
fact
of
what
the
economic
substance
of
these
trusts
really
are.
and
in
any
real
sense
of
economic
substance,
there
simply
was
no
equivalence
between
the
two
trusts
that
were
created.
no
equivalence
of
even
the
same
character
of
estates
or
economic
significance
of
these
estates
that
were
created
by
these
trusts.
mr.
william
s.
downard
your
honor,
she
died
in
1937.
the
lehman
case
was
decided
in
1940.
in
--
when
her
estate
was
under
examination
in
about
1943,
must
i
stop
now?
mr.
william
s.
downard
when
--
when
her
estate
was
under
examination
in
1943,
there
was
a
contention
that
the
trust
should
be
taxed
as
reciprocal
manner.
here
is
where
the
revenue
service
--
if
we
really
thought
these
were
reciprocal
trusts
could
have
taxed
joseph
grace's
trust
to
janet
grace's
estate.
it
didn't
do
that.
they
compromised
--
they
entered
into
a
compromised
agreement
whereby
55%
of
the
janet
grace
trust
was
included
in
janet's
estate
and
in
this
case
they
are
trying
to
include
it
again
in
joseph's
estate
and
impose
two
estate
taxes
on
the
same
trust
and
no
case
has
ever
held
that
the
reciprocal
trust
doctrine
should
result
in
double
taxation.
mr.
william
s.
downard
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court,
i
want
to
digress
a
moment
before
continuing
my
argument
on
the
merits
of
the
case
to
take
out
the
point
mentioned
by
the
solicitor
general
on
the
serious
question
of
jurisdiction.
we
strongly
believe
that
this
petition
was
out
obtained.
it
was
filed
on
the
160th
day
after
this
decision
was
printed
and
announced
by
the
court
of
claims
formally
a
55
page
document
which
contains
as
the
solicitor
general
read
to
you
a
statement
that
the
findings
of
fact
which
are
made
as
part
of
the
judgment
herein.
the
basic
court's
conclusion
that
the
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
recover
and
state's
judgment
is
entered
to
that
effect
and
a
docket
entry
was
made
that
judgment
was
entered
on
that
day.
the
findings
of
fact
which
are
incorporated
expressly
in
the
judgment
state
the
amounts
and
date
from
which
interest
runs,
everything
necessary
to
determine
the
amount.
there
had
never
been
any
question
as
to
the
amount
and
it
was
routinely
stipulated
and
a
subsequent
one-page
typewritten
order
entered
that
merely
confirmed
the
amount
as
shown
in
the
original
findings
of
fact
that
were
made
back
on
april
19,
1968
and
that
should
be
the
time
from
which
the
time
runs
for
filing
a
petition
according
to
all
of
the
standards
set
forth
in
this
court's
case
as
such
as
minneapolis-honeywell
and
the
schaefer
brewing
case
and
the
last
case
i
believe
which
the
court
has
addressed
itself
specifically
to
a
court
of
claims
case
of
this
sort
was
the
adams
case
cited
in
the
government's
brief
in
response
and
that
case
clearly
indicated
that
a
second
judgment
unless
it
were
inextricably
leaned
with
the
issue
dealt
within
the
first
judgment
that
sought
to
be
reviewed
is
not
the
measuring
time
from
which
the
time
for
filing
a
petition
begins.
well,
after
that
digression
let
me
get
back
to
the
merits
of
the
case.
the
solicitor
general
has
presented
the
court
with
the
paradox
that
while
he
concedes
that
consideration
must
be
interpreted
in
the
light
of
the
actual
facts
of
the
case,
he
has
not
come
to
grips
with
the
actual
facts
of
the
case
as
found
by
the
court
of
claims,
instead
referring
only
to
certain
language
out
of
the
dissenting
opinion.
the
dissenting
judge
simply
did
not
agree
with
the
facts
as
found
by
the
court
and
the
court
did
find
the
facts
and
the
facts
as
found
by
the
court
should
be
accepted
as
the
facts
of
this
case.
those
facts
pertinent
to
the
question
of
whether
these
trusts
were
created
in
consideration
of
each
other
which
has
always
been
the
tests
are
as
follows
and
they
are
not
purely
subjective
facts.
there
are
objective
facts
set
forth
in
detail
in
the
record
detailing
a
long
history
of
gifts
by
this
decedent
of
large
and
valuable
properties
not
inconsequential
gifts.
they
were
properties
worth
considerable
sums
of
money
that
he
had
given
to
his
wife.
he
had
made
one
or
more
such
gifts
either
to
his
wife
or
in
trust
for
his
children
in
every
year
over
25
year
period
from
1917
to
1942
with
the
exception
of
the
year
1921
and
except
that
for
the
few
years
immediately
after
the
creation
of
these
trusts
in
december
1931
he
didn't
create
any
trust.
the
obvious
reason
being
that
in
this
december
1931
trust,
as
shown
by
the
evidence
and
found
by
the
court,
he
was
anticipating
the
enactment
of
a
gift
tax
law
in
1932.
there
was
no
gift
tax
at
that
time
and
the
gift
tax
law
was
indeed
enacted
in
1932
and
the
only
stated
reason
for
the
decedent's
acting
at
this
particular
time
was
the
fact
that
he
heard
the
gift
tax
law
was
going
to
be
enacted
and
he
said
anything
further
i
am
going
to
do
in
my
program
of
giving
--
i
should
do
before
the
gift
tax
comes
in
because
if
i
postpone
it
i
have
to
pay
for
a
gift
tax.
if
i
go
ahead
and
do
it
now,
i
won't
have
to
and
that
is
not
an
evil
tax
avoidance
motive.
it's
just
as
a
man
of
common
sense
saying
i've
been
giving
away
probably
all
my
life
and
this
is
my
means
of
expressing
my
affection
to
my
dependent
loved
ones
and
if
i
postpone
it
i
will
have
to
pay
additional
taxes
so
why
wait.
so
he
was
anxious
to
go
ahead
and
do
it
and
this
is
the
full
explanation
of
the
reason
that
these
two
trusts
happened
to
have
been
created
at
the
same
time
because
he
was
anxious
to
get
things
done
before
this
gift
tax
came
in.
certainly,
if
these
two
transactions
have
been
done
with
different
forms
as
easily
they
could
have
been
or
if
they
had
been
done
at
different
times
if
the
decedent
had
carried
out
his
program
of
giving
in
his
usual
manner
and
given
away
one
of
these
properties
in
1931
and
another
one
in
1932
and
another
one
in
1933
and
another
in
1934
and
so
forth.
and
if
janet
grace
at
any
other
time
had
placed
her
homestead
in
trust
to
preserve
and
maintain
it
for
her
family
and
children
nobody
would
say
that
these
trusts
are
reciprocal.
it's
purely
the
superficial
appearance
created
by
the
time
that
gives
the
government
any
argument
that
these
trusts
have
any
appearance
similar
to
those
that
have
been
held
reciprocal
in
any
cases.
and
that
factor
of
timing
is
fully
explained
by
the
decedent's
anticipation
of
the
gift
tax
law.
certainly,
that
fact
that
this
is
concerned
about
gift
tax
law
was
his
prime
worry
at
the
time
merely
serves
to
emphasize
that
these
trusts
really
were
donative
in
nature
and
he
certainly
considered
that
he
was
making
a
gift
or
he
wouldn't
have
been
worried
about
the
gift
tax
if
he
thought
that
he
was
making
some
exchange
for
considerations
with
his
wife.
but
the
court
has
expressly
tried
this
case
through
a
long
trial
in
a
very
comprehensive
record
in
analysis
of
the
facts
and
the
trier
of
facts
has
determined
that
these
word
gratuitous
gifts
that
were
made.
the
solicitor
general
has
indicated
that
consideration
should
not
be
the
test
in
this
case
and
yet
his
argument
is
based
on
cases
such
as
the
lehman
case
that
is
expressly
based
on
consideration.
the
lehman
case
was
certainly
was
one
in
which
the
court
could
have
completely
admitted
to
consideration
test
and
just
said
well,
the
economic
substance
of
these
transactions
is
the
same
as
if
each
the
brother
had
created
a
trust
for
himself
but
it
didn't
stop
there.
the
lehman
case
went
on
to
say
and
to
point
out
that
this
was
not
the
significant
point
and
said
that
the
decisive
point
in
this
case
is
that
by
transferring
his
own
property
to
his
brother,
he
caused
his
brother
to
make
his
brother
to
make
the
other
trust
for
his
benefit
and
then
it
went
on
to
talk
about
consideration
and
quid
pro
quo.
now,
the
solicitor
general
has
picked
up
only
one
phrase
out
of
that
sentence
he
said.
in
the
lehman
case,
one
brother
caused
the
other
brother
to
make
the
trust.
but
it
wanted
the
fact
that
he
caused
him
to
make
the
trust
by
asking
him
to,
requesting
him
to,
suggesting
that
he
do
it
or
advising
that
he
do
it,
or
planning
the
trust
instruments,
the
case
specifically
said
that
by
transferring
his
own
property
he
caused
it
and
then
in
the
hanauer
case
in
the
second
circuit
which
followed
on
the
lehman
case,
the
second
circuit
explained
and
reiterated
that
it
was
furnishing
of
a
consideration
or
a
quid
pro
quo
whereby
transferring
his
own
property
the
decedent
had
caused
the
other
transfer
to
be
made
and
so
the
consideration
test
is
a
causation
test
but
it's
a
causation
test
based
on
whether
one
transfer
of
property
causes
another
transfer
of
property.
it
is
not
a
question
of
whether
one
person
such
as
a
husband
causes
a
donor
to
make
a
gift
to
him
by
requesting
it.
a
donor
is
nonetheless
a
donor
and
a
donee
is
nonetheless
a
donee
simply
because
the
donee
requests,
suggests,
advises,
recommends,
wheedles,
or
cajoles.
if
a
son
asks
his
father
to
give
him
a
piece
of
property
because
he
wants
it,
if
the
father
gives
it
to
him
it's
still
a
gift.
if
a
husband
asks
his
wife
or
plans
and
arranges
for
his
wife
to
give
him
a
piece
of
property
and
puts
a
deed
in
front
of
her,
she
owns
the
property
and
it's
only
she
that
has
the
right
to
say
no
i
won't
give
it
or
yes
i
will
and
all
she
has
to
do
to
make
a
transfer
in
terms
of
the
estate
tax
and
the
gift
tax
is
to
sign
that
deed
and
that's
what
janet
grace
did.
you
may
draw
an
analogy
to
the
community
property
situation
where
a
husband
is
a
sole
manager
of
a
community
with
the
right
to
dispose
of
it
even
without
his
wife's
knowledge
or
consent
and
if
he
does
give
it
away,
and
she
owned
a
half
interest
in
it
and
that
half
interest
passes
to
somebody
else
even
without
her
knowledge
and
consent
it's
held
that
she
made
a
taxable
gift
for
gift
tax
purposes,
for
estate
tax
purposes,
it
may
be
a
gift
in
contemplation
of
debt,
and
yet
she
has
nothing
to
say
about
it
and
so
the
government's
argument
that
the
wife
because
the
wife
was
merely
compliant
or
acquiescent
to
her
husband's
wishes,
somehow
means
that
she
didn't
make
a
transfer
of
her
property
to
this
trust
seems
aside
from
the
point
and
contrary
to
the
whole
established
concepts
of
stating
gift
taxes.
mr.
william
s.
downard
your
honor,
this
case
was
originally
filed
in
1959.
i
tried
the
case
i
was
employed
in
1962.
it
had
been
through
various
stages
of
pretrial.
the
pretrial
proceedings
in
the
court
of
claims
were
extremely
elaborate
and
very
detailed.
i
was
employed
in
1962
and
the
latter
part
of
1962.
i
tried
the
case
in
the
summer
of
1963
after
a
more
elaborate
pretrial
proceedings,
the
case
then
went
up
to
the
--
it
takes
a
long
time
because
you
have
to
--
the
trial
commissioner
sets
like
a
district
judge
and
he
makes
a
decision
which
is
then
automatically
reviewed
by
the
judges
of
the
court
much
like
an
appeal
so
you
have
to
submit
briefs
to
the
commissioner.
he
then
has
to
take
time
to
make
his
decision
and
recommendation
and
that
goes
up
to
the
court
and
after
this
case
went
up
to
the
court
of
claims,
i
believe
in
1965,
they
remanded
it
for
a
further
trial
because
the
government
argued
that
the
whole
essence
of
the
case
was
that
the
decedent
created
these
trusts
for
tax
avoidance
motives
and
the
court
was
interested
in
that
and
said,
"well,
now
if
these
were
a
tax
avoidance
device
that
may
affect
our
disposition
of
the
case"
so
they
remanded
it
for
a
further
trial
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
decedent
was
motivated
to
avoid
or
lessen
estate
taxes
with
reference
to
the
creation
of
these
trusts.
and
another
full
trial
was
held
and
the
conclusion
of
fact
was
reached
that
there
was
no
motive
gift
taxes
in
this
--
there
was
no
motive
to
avoid
estate
taxes
in
this
case
which
and
that
there
was
no
showing
of
any
motive
of
tax
avoidance
of
any
kind
and
the
evidence
clearly
supported
that
for
the
decedent
created
this
trust
in
a
routine
and
cavalier
fashion
run
down
very
hurriedly
in
december
of
1931
not
considered
for
a
long
time
and
he
never
consulted
any
tax
attorney,
any
tax
adviser
of
any
kind
with
reference
to
the
tax
consequences
of
these
large
trust
that
he
created
which
is
almost
inconceivable
that
a
man
would
create
trust
of
this
size
without
consulting
a
tax
adviser
but
he
did
because
he
wasn't
concerned
about
taxes,
he
was
concerned
about
providing
for
his
dependent
loved
ones
as
he
had
been
doing
all
his
life,
and
the
court
of
claims
found
as
a
fact
that
these
trusts
were
merely
part
of
this
long
pattern
and
history
of
gifts
that
these
parties
have
been
making.
now,
on
the
question
of
what
the
law
is
in
this
case,
the
solicitor
general
read
to
the
court
excerpts
from
the
committee
reports
including
the
following,
however,
in
1914
in
lehman
against
commissioner,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
held
that
where
trusts
are
found
to
have
been
created
each
in
consideration
of
the
other,
the
nominal
grantor
should
be
interchanged
and
then
he
said
right
after
that
there
is
no
reference
to
consideration
in
the
committee
reports,
and
i
ask
you
to
again
read
the
language
that
he
read
to
the
court
which
specifically
does
mention
where
the
trusts
are
found
to
have
been
created
in
consideration
of
each
other
so
congress
was
confronted,
was
fully
apprised
of
and
recognized
the
existence
of
the
consideration
requirement
as
set
forth
in
lehman
and
the
case
is
following
it.
it
shows
not
to
legislate
any
different
rule
and
therefore
accepted
that
rule
and
certainly
the
lehman
rule
that
the
court
that
the
congress
expressly
approved
of
in
the
1949
committee
reports,
when
it
shows
not
to
do
anything
but
grant
some
relief
legislation
was
the
very
test
that
the
court
of
claims
used
in
the
decision
below
and
that
is
as
stated
by
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
moreno
case,
perhaps
one
of
the
most
recent
cases
on
the
subject
that
whether
this
doctrine
applies
is
simply
a
question
of
fact
whether
one
trust
was
created
in
consideration
for
the
other
trust
and
where
trust
have
been
found
not
to
have
been
created
in
consideration
of
each
other
factually,
the
courts
have
held
in
case
after
case
that
the
trusts
are
not
taxable
reciprocal
in
the
absence
of
consideration.
in
case
after
case
which
had
held
trust
taxable
reciprocally,
the
courts
have
clearly
set
forth
the
rule
and
discussed
the
matter
as
a
factual
test
of
whether
these
trusts
were
created
in
consideration
of
each
other.
now,
that
is
what
all
of
the
previous
cases
have
held.
but
even
needing
the
solicitor
general
on
his
own
battleground
and
saying
there
is
no
consideration
test
despite
what
all
the
cases
have
said,
despite
what
congress
said,
let's
assume
there's
no
consideration
test
and
that
we
confront
this
matter
merely
as
a
question
of
whether
the
economic
substance
and
effect
is
the
same
whether
that
the
consequence
is
or
the
same
as
the
solicitor
general
said
as
if
mr.
and
mrs.
grace
had
each
created
a
trust
for
himself
and
when
you
confront
the
realities
and
the
facts
of
this
case,
you
find
that
those
economic
consequences
were
not
the
same
and
could
not
be
the
same
because
of
the
non-equivalence
in
the
whole
nature
of
the
two
different
trusts.
now,
let
me
call
attention
to
one
further
thing
in
even
approaching
the
form
of
these
transactions
as
the
solicitor
general
does
that
