mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
court.
this
is
an
estate
tax
case
which
comes
here
from
the
court
of
claims.
now,
before
starting
to
discuss
the
merits
of
the
case,
i
would
point
out
that
the
respondent
has
raised
a
question
of
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
it
is
discussed
in
the
reply
memorandum
which
we
filed
in
connection
with
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
i
want
to
discuss
it
now
very
briefly
only
to
make
a
claim
that
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
appropriately
a
jurisdictional
question
here.
it
starts
out
i
think
--
the
way
it
starts
out
can
best
be
seen
by
looking
first
at
page
123
of
the
record
where
the
court
of
claims
on
april
19,
--
april
18
said
upon
the
foregoing
findings
of
facts
which
are
made
a
part
of
the
judgment
herein,
the
court
concludes
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
recover
and
judgment
is
entered
to
that
effect.
the
amount
of
recovery,
will
be
determined
pursuant
to
rule
47
(c)
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
there
is
on
page
2
of
the
record
a
pasted
in
correction
of
the
record
because
the
respondents
felt
that
the
record
is
it
had
been
submitted
was
not
accurate
and
that
shows
april
19
judgment
for
plaintiff
with
the
amount
of
recovery
to
be
determined
by
further
proceedings.
and
then
there
was
a
stipulation
and
the
final
order
of
the
court
appears
at
page
125
of
the
record.
it
is
therefore
ordered
that
judgment
be
and
the
same
is
entered
for
the
plaintiffs
in
the
sum
of
$419,221.05
together
with
interest
thereon
from
july
14,
1954
as
provided
by
law
and
that
was
entered
on
june
28th.
the
government's
position
for
certiorari
was
filed
on
september
26th
which
was
within
the
90
days.
we
believe
that
this
question
has
been
several
times
passed
upon
by
this
court
and
perhaps
most
clearly
and
effectively
in
connection
with
the
case
of
united
states
against
bianchi
and
company
where
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinion
but
were
substantially
the
same
question
was
raised
in
opposition
to
the
government's
petition.
the
government
responded
on
the
jurisdictional
ground.
the
court
granted
the
petition
and
decided
the
case
on
the
merits.
now,
with
respect
to
the
merits
of
this
case,
it
is
a
question
of
the
taxability
of
one
of
two
reciprocal
trust
created
by
a
husband
and
wife
within
15
days
of
each
other
at
the
close
of
1931.
the
question
involving
reciprocal
trust
was
one
which
people
regarded
as
subtle
and
nearly
30
years
ago,
by
an
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
lehman
against
the
commissioner,
an
opinion
by
judge
patterson
which
was
concurred
in
by
judge
learned
hand
and
judge
chase
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
and
stated
the
thing
as
followed
after
that
case
is
i
think
exemplified
by
the
title
of
an
article
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
was
published
in
1948,
colgan
and
molloy,
“converse
trusts
–
the
rise
and
fall
of
a
tax
avoidance
device.”
i
think
it
was
lord
mcnaughton
who
said
that
it's
one
thing
to
put
shelly's
case
in
a
nutshell
and
another
thing
to
keep
it
there
and
this
case
illustrates
the
fact
that
it's
one
thing
to
get
in
the
state
tax
point
decided
and
another
thing
to
keep
it
decided.
now,
what
then
are
the
facts
of
this
case?
the
case
as
i
have
said
comes
from
the
court
of
claims
and
the
findings
of
fact
if
the
court
of
claims
begins
at
page
87
of
the
record.
they
show
in
substance
in
effect
that
joseph
p.
grace
and
janet
grace
were
husband
and
wife
that
they
lived
happily
together,
that
the
husband
was
quite
wealthy
and
frequently
made
gifts
to
his
wife
from
time
to
time
after
he
returned
property
which
he
had
given
to
her
which
she
always
did
and
on
page
88
of
the
record,
we
have
finding
five
the
decedent
exercised
supervision
and
control
over
and
he
made
the
decisions
that
were
involved
in
the
management
of
the
business
affairs
of
the
family.
and
then
the
last
sentence
in
that
paragraph,
when
the
decedent
decided
that
some
formal
action
by
janet
grace
was
required
in
connection
with
the
management
or
disposition
of
a
piece
of
property
or
a
financial
interest
that
was
in
her
ownership,
the
decedent
customarily
would
have
the
appropriate
instrument
for
his
wife's
signature
and
with
then
ever
execute
such
instrument.
in
the
latter
part
of
1931,
mr.
grace
became
concerned
of
some
indication
that
there
were
suggestions
to
him
of
ways
to
minimize
taxes
at
least
gift
taxes
which
he
thought
would
become
effective
and
in
1932
as
they
did
in
fact
become
effective
and
on
december
15,
1931,
mr.
grace
created
a
trust,
the
essential
terms
of
which
are
set
forth
on
pages
92
to
94
of
the
record
in
the
court's
findings.
they
provided
that
certain
property
was
transferred
to
trustees
upon
trust
for
his
wife
for
life
with
remainder
as
she
might
by
will
of
point
with
power
in
the
trustees
to
convey
the
principle
to
her
and
with
gifts
in
default
of
appointment
to
his
heirs.
and
then
the
finding
show
on
page
98
to
100
that
15
days
later
on
december
30,
1931
mrs.
grace
executed
a
trust
instrument
which
was
essentially
identical
except
reciprocal,
that
is
it
was
a
trust
by
which
she
transferred
certain
property
including
the
family
residence
to
trustees
upon
trust
for
her
husband
for
life
with
power
in
the
trustees
to
convey
the
principle
to
him
with
remainder
subject
to
his
appointment
and
give
in
default
of
appointment
to
her
heirs.
mrs.
grace
died
in
the
1930s
and
mr.
grace
lived
until
1951.
when
mr.
grace
died,
the
government
contended
pursuant
to
the
lehman
case
that
the
trust
which
she
had
created
was
one
which
should
be
included
in
his
gross
estate
as
a
trust
in
which
he
had
reserved
a
life
estate.
the
trust
was
of
course
formally
created
by
her.
it
provided
for
a
life
estate
in
him.
the
estate
paid
the
tax
pursuant
to
the
demand
of
the
government.
claims
for
refund
were
filed
when
they
were
not
acted
on
within
the
six
months
that
this
suit
was
brought
in
the
court
of
claims.
the
difficulty
arises
i
think
largely
from
the
fact
that
in
the
lehman
case,
the
four
trusts
were
created
by
two
brothers,
two
each
for
the
other
as
the
result
of
an
agreement
between
them.
there
is
as
a
consequence
some
talk
in
the
lehman
opinion
to
the
effect
that
one
trust
was
created
in
consideration
of
the
other
that
there
is
a
more
talk
as
there
is
in
page
27
of
the
respondent's
brief
where
there
is
an
extensive
quotation
from
the
lehman
opinion
where
there
is
more
talk
of
how
the
decedent
by
transfer
of
his
share
to
his
brother
caused
the
brother
to
make
a
transfer
of
property
in
trust
and
could
there
be
a
clearer
case
than
this
one
that
the
decedent
caused
his
wife
janet
to
make
this
transfer.
he
drew
up
the
instruments.
he
made
the
plan.
the
court
of
claims
has
found
the
final
finding
on
page
122
and
123
of
the
record.
the
joseph
grace
trust
and
the
janet
grace
trust
were
created
by
or
at
the
instigation
of
joseph
p.
grace
as
parts
of
what
was
essentially
a
single
transaction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
was
at
that
time,
her
own
property.
it
--
it
had
come
i
think
in
large
part
or
entirely
originally
from
him.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
believe
so
mr.
justice.
perhaps
something
could
have
been
made
to
turn
on
at
an
earlier
stage
of
the
case
but
no
intention
has
been
made
that
this
was
anything
other
than
her
property
which
she
transferred
in
trust
for
him
in
connection
with
or
almost
contemporaneously
with
a
transfer
of
property
which
she
made
in
trust
for
her.
now,
the
court
below
seized
on
this
concept
of
consideration
as
some
of
the
other
courts
have
following
the
lehman
case
and
the
respondent
basis
his
whole
argument
on
it.
if
i
am
caught
by
the
consideration
argument,
my
path
may
be
somewhat
difficult
though
i
do
not
think
that
even
then
it
is
hopeless
for
consideration
must
be
interpreted
in
the
later
the
actual
facts
of
the
case.
well,
i
don't
think
the
question
in
this
case
ought
to
be
made
to
turn
on
any
questions
of
whether
there
is
a
consideration
in
the
contract
sense
of
course
there
was
no
bargaining
here.
there
was
nothing
of
what
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
a
recent
decision
involving
a
somewhat
related
question
has
referred
to
as
treating
(inaudible).
this
was
a
question
of
mutual
gifts
not
of
bargain
at
arm's
length.
these
spouses
did
not
operate
on
that
basis
as
most
spouses
do
not
sort
of
a
divorce
settlement
and
here
there
was
never
a
divorce
and
no
property
settlement
of
that
kind.
as
the
court
of
claims
has
found
these
two
trusts
were
created
as
part
of
a
single
plan
which
was
devised
and
actuated
by
mr.
grace.
in
the
court
of
claims,
there
is
a
dissenting
opinion
by
judge
davis
who
deals
extensively
with
this
problem.
he
uses
a
good
many
other
words
page
75
of
the
record
interconnected,
page
76
mutuality
further
down
on
the
page

and

page
78
he
refers
to
–-
well
it's
on
page
80,
he
refers
to
cross
trusts
are
seen
as
interdependent.
page
84
he
refers
to
the
true
reciprocity
and
interdependence
and
says
if
the
cross
trust
arrangement
was
mutual
and
interdependent,
there
is
such
a
transfer
and
on
page
85
he
refers
to
the
crossing
was
not
haphazard
but
part
of
a
single
interdependent
transaction.
reciprocal
trusts
are
in
fact
outside
the
direct
language
of
the
statute
but
the
court
in
the
lehman
case
and
in
many
other
cases
have
uncrossed
the
trust
relying
on
the
fundamental
rule
repeatedly
reaffirmed
by
this
court.
now,
the
tax
consequences
flow
from
the
economic
substance
and
effect
of
a
transaction
and
not
its
form.
this
is
rather
like
a
converse
of
the
gregory
situation.
there
the
transaction
came
within
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
but
this
court
held
that
what
was
done
was
a
mere
device
and
not
within
the
substance
or
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
this
recalls
other
expression
of
this
court
at
this
period
in
barnette
and
wells,
the
court
through
mr.
justice
cardozo
referred
to
the
record
of
the
government's
endeavor
to
keep
pace
with
the
fertility
of
invention
whereby
taxpayers
had
contrived
to
keep
the
larger
benefits
of
ownership
and
be
relieved
from
the
attended
burdens
and
shortly
thereafter
in
griffith
against
commissioner,
the
court
referred
to
a
lawyer's
ingenuity
devised
a
technically
elegant
arrangement
whereby
an
intricate
outward
appearance
was
given
in
that
case
to
make
the
thing
look
to
be
sale
rather
than
the
payment
of
a
dividend.
our
submission
is
that
the
existence
of
consideration,
the
existence
of
a
bargain
for
quid
pro
quo
is
not
the
touchstone
of
the
lehman
case
but
it
is
simply
a
question
of
whether
there
are
mutual
gifts,
whether
the
consequence
of
the
transaction
as
it
was
carried
out
is
essentially
the
same
as
it
would
be
if
mr.
grace
had
created
a
trust
for
himself
and
mrs.
grace
had
created
a
trust
for
herself
and
this
construction
of
the
reciprocal
trust
situation
has
been
confirmed
by
congress.
this
was
in
the
technical
changes
act
of
1949
following
this
court's
decision
in
the
church
and
spiegel
cases.
congress
then
provided
for
tax
free
release
of
powers
reserved
in
reciprocal
trusts,
of
powers
reserved
on
reciprocal
trusts,
effective
until
december
31,
1950,
that
was
a
little
over
a
year
after
the
statute
was
passed.
this
did
not
provide
for
tax
free
release
of
retained
life
estates
or
reciprocal
trust
estates
unless
the
trusts
had
been
irrevocably
established
before
march
3,
1931
and
that
would
not
apply
in
this
case
because
the
trusts
were
established
in
december
1931.
in
connection
with
this
1949
statute,
the
committee
reports
are
explicit.
the
senate
report
which
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
house
report
is
set
out
in
page
23
of
our
brief.
prior
to
1940,
the
senate
report
says
certain
reciprocal
trusts
were
established
with
the
apparent
intent
of
minimizing
estate
taxes
by
what
were
then
considered
effective
means
and
going
to
the
end
of
that
paragraph,
by
this
reciprocal
device
it
was
thought
that
two
persons
could
transfer
property
to
their
heirs
without
diminishing
effective
control
during
life
but
still
paying
the
gift
tax
rather
than
the
estate
tax.
and
then
the
last
paragraph
on
that
page,
however,
in
1940,
in
lehman
against
commissioner,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
held
that
where
trusts
were
found
to
have
been
created
each
in
consideration
of
the
other,
the
nominal
grantors
are
to
be
interchanged
for
tax
purposes
and
the
court
--
the
congress
went
on
to
provide
that
there
should
be
a
limited
period
when
persons
who
in
the
sense
had
been
caught
by
that
could
release
powers
but
made
no
provision
for
releasing
life
estate
or
transferring
life
estates
in
reciprocal
trusts
unless
the
life
estate
has
been
created
before
march
3,
1931
which
was
the
date
of
the
statute
which
congress
passed
explicitly
making
taxable
the
reservation
of
a
life
estate.
now,
there
is
no
reference
to
consideration
in
these
committee
reports
or
to
a
bargain
for
or
arm's
length
transaction.
there
is
the
simple
factual
statement
an
individual
might
establish
a
trust
at
the
same
time
or
a
short
time
after
the
husband
set
up
the
trust,
his
wife
would
also
establish
a
trust
and
that
is
of
course
precisely
what
we
have
involved
here.
a
good
deal
was
made
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
claims
out
of
the
fact
that
it
was
perfectly
obvious
that
mrs.
grace
had
no
motivation
here
except
to
be
a
good
wife
to
her
husband
and
since
it
appeared
that
mrs.
grace
was
not
trying
to
save
taxes
had
no
conscious
motivation
of
an
effort
to
save
taxes
the
court
of
claims
felt
that
the
trust
could
not
come
with
the
reciprocal
trust
rule
but
we
submit
that
the
subjective
facts
that
motivated
mrs.
grace
or
mr.
grace
have
no
pertinence.
they
were
not
bargaining,
they
were
not
purchasing,
it's
obvious
that
mrs.
grace's
only
motivation
was
to
do
what
her
husband
wanted
her
to
do
which
she
did
promptly
and
cheerfully
without
harm
to
herself
as
was
always
the
case.
all
of
the
motivation,
all
of
the
decision
came
from
mr.
grace.
these
were
not
bargain
for
transfers
but
they
were
planned
transfers,
mutual
gifts,
artfully
contrived
part
of
a
single
transaction,
obviously
with
some
tax
motivation
to
get
in
ahead
of
the
gift
tax
which
was
successfully
accomplished.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
white,
the
one
mrs.
grace
created
is
the
one
which
is
included
in
his
estate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
is
treated
as
the
settlor
of
the
trust
which
she
signed
which
transferred
property
upon
trust
for
him
for
life.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it's
the
value
of
that
property
which
is
included
here.
these
trusts
were
planned
by
mr.
grace
together.
they
were
executed
within
a
span
of
15
days.
they
were
virtually
identical
in
terms.
they
were
executed
in
accordance
with
the
plan
of
the
decedent
and
were
parts
of
what
was
essentially
a
single
transaction.
on
this
record,
it
is
plain
that
these
trusts
were
imminently
connected
in
their
inception
and
that
is
enough
to
invoke
the
rule
of
the
lehman
case
as
congress
has
confirmed.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
claim
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
one
point
which
i
would
like
to
clarify
and
that
is
the
suggestion
that
the
janet
grace
trust
is
being
taxed
twice.
i
think
it
also
bears
on
the
argument
of
consideration
and
rather
shows
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
mutual
gifts,
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
consideration
can
be
clarified
by
thinking
of
it
in
terms
of
value.
it
is
the
treasury's
practice
in
the
case
of
mutual
gifts
to
say
that
they
are
reciprocal
or
crossed
to
the
extent
of
mutual
value
and
if
one
of
the
trusts
is
bigger
than
the
other,
then
the
excess
is
treated
as
a
gift,
independent
of
the
other.
now,
what
happened
here
was
that
when
mrs.
grace
died,
the
question
was
should
be
included
in
her
estate?
and
i
think
that
what
was
included
in
her
estate
was
the
joseph
grace
trust,
but
to
the
extent
of
the
mutual
value.
as
the
janet
grace
trust
was
the
smaller
trust
the
mutual
value
was
determined
by
finding
the
value
of
the
janet
grace
trust
and
thus
it
was
that
part
of
the
joseph
grace
trust
which
is
measured
in
value
by
the
janet
grace
trust
which
was
included
in
the
--
in
mrs.
grace's
estate.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
controversial.
there
were
questions
as
to
value.
it
was
finally
settled
by
including
55%
of
the
value
but
the
significant
thing
i
think
is
that
it
is
mutual
value.
it
is
analogous
to
consideration
in
the
case
like
the
lehman
case.
it
is
appropriate
to
talk
about
consideration.
it
is
of
course
quite
true
that
the
committee
report
which
i
read
uses
the
word
consideration
but
there
still
remains
the
question
of
construing
or
interpreting
what
that
means.
i
do
not
think
that
it
means
a
bargain
for
item
something
over
which
the
parties
haggled.
i
think
it
is
fully
applicable
to
a
case
of
mutual
gifts
which
was
involved
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
court.
this
is
an
estate
tax
case
which
comes
here
from
the
court
of
claims.
now,
before
starting
to
discuss
the
merits
of
the
case,
i
would
point
out
that
the
respondent
has
raised
a
question
of
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
it
is
discussed
in
the
reply
memorandum
which
we
filed
in
connection
with
our
petition
for
certiorari
and
i
want
to
discuss
it
now
very
briefly
only
to
make
a
claim
that
i
do
not
think
that
there
is
appropriately
a
jurisdictional
question
here.
it
starts
out
i
think
--
the
way
it
starts
out
can
best
be
seen
by
looking
first
at
page
123
of
the
record
where
the
court
of
claims
on
april
19,
--
april
18
said
upon
the
foregoing
findings
of
facts
which
are
made
a
part
of
the
judgment
herein,
the
court
concludes
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
recover
and
judgment
is
entered
to
that
effect.
the
amount
of
recovery,
will
be
determined
pursuant
to
rule
47
(c)
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
there
is
on
page
2
of
the
record
a
pasted
in
correction
of
the
record
because
the
respondents
felt
that
the
record
is
it
had
been
submitted
was
not
accurate
and
that
shows
april
19
judgment
for
plaintiff
with
the
amount
of
recovery
to
be
determined
by
further
proceedings.
and
then
there
was
a
stipulation
and
the
final
order
of
the
court
appears
at
page
125
of
the
record.
it
is
therefore
ordered
that
judgment
be
and
the
same
is
entered
for
the
plaintiffs
in
the
sum
of
$419,221.05
together
with
interest
thereon
from
july
14,
1954
as
provided
by
law
and
that
was
entered
on
june
28th.
the
government's
position
for
certiorari
was
filed
on
september
26th
which
was
within
the
90
days.
we
believe
that
this
question
has
been
several
times
passed
upon
by
this
court
and
perhaps
most
clearly
and
effectively
in
connection
with
the
case
of
united
states
against
bianchi
and
company
where
there
is
nothing
in
the
opinion
but
were
substantially
the
same
question
was
raised
in
opposition
to
the
government's
petition.
the
government
responded
on
the
jurisdictional
ground.
the
court
granted
the
petition
and
decided
the
case
on
the
merits.
now,
with
respect
to
the
merits
of
this
case,
it
is
a
question
of
the
taxability
of
one
of
two
reciprocal
trust
created
by
a
husband
and
wife
within
15
days
of
each
other
at
the
close
of
1931.
the
question
involving
reciprocal
trust
was
one
which
people
regarded
as
subtle
and
nearly
30
years
ago,
by
an
opinion
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
lehman
against
the
commissioner,
an
opinion
by
judge
patterson
which
was
concurred
in
by
judge
learned
hand
and
judge
chase
a
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
and
this
court
denied
certiorari
and
stated
the
thing
as
followed
after
that
case
is
i
think
exemplified
by
the
title
of
an
article
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
was
published
in
1948,
colgan
and
molloy,
“converse
trusts
–
the
rise
and
fall
of
a
tax
avoidance
device.”
i
think
it
was
lord
mcnaughton
who
said
that
it's
one
thing
to
put
shelly's
case
in
a
nutshell
and
another
thing
to
keep
it
there
and
this
case
illustrates
the
fact
that
it's
one
thing
to
get
in
the
state
tax
point
decided
and
another
thing
to
keep
it
decided.
now,
what
then
are
the
facts
of
this
case?
the
case
as
i
have
said
comes
from
the
court
of
claims
and
the
findings
of
fact
if
the
court
of
claims
begins
at
page
87
of
the
record.
they
show
in
substance
in
effect
that
joseph
p.
grace
and
janet
grace
were
husband
and
wife
that
they
lived
happily
together,
that
the
husband
was
quite
wealthy
and
frequently
made
gifts
to
his
wife
from
time
to
time
after
he
returned
property
which
he
had
given
to
her
which
she
always
did
and
on
page
88
of
the
record,
we
have
finding
five
the
decedent
exercised
supervision
and
control
over
and
he
made
the
decisions
that
were
involved
in
the
management
of
the
business
affairs
of
the
family.
and
then
the
last
sentence
in
that
paragraph,
when
the
decedent
decided
that
some
formal
action
by
janet
grace
was
required
in
connection
with
the
management
or
disposition
of
a
piece
of
property
or
a
financial
interest
that
was
in
her
ownership,
the
decedent
customarily
would
have
the
appropriate
instrument
for
his
wife's
signature
and
with
then
ever
execute
such
instrument.
in
the
latter
part
of
1931,
mr.
grace
became
concerned
of
some
indication
that
there
were
suggestions
to
him
of
ways
to
minimize
taxes
at
least
gift
taxes
which
he
thought
would
become
effective
and
in
1932
as
they
did
in
fact
become
effective
and
on
december
15,
1931,
mr.
grace
created
a
trust,
the
essential
terms
of
which
are
set
forth
on
pages
92
to
94
of
the
record
in
the
court's
findings.
they
provided
that
certain
property
was
transferred
to
trustees
upon
trust
for
his
wife
for
life
with
remainder
as
she
might
by
will
of
point
with
power
in
the
trustees
to
convey
the
principle
to
her
and
with
gifts
in
default
of
appointment
to
his
heirs.
and
then
the
finding
show
on
page
98
to
100
that
15
days
later
on
december
30,
1931
mrs.
grace
executed
a
trust
instrument
which
was
essentially
identical
except
reciprocal,
that
is
it
was
a
trust
by
which
she
transferred
certain
property
including
the
family
residence
to
trustees
upon
trust
for
her
husband
for
life
with
power
in
the
trustees
to
convey
the
principle
to
him
with
remainder
subject
to
his
appointment
and
give
in
default
of
appointment
to
her
heirs.
mrs.
grace
died
in
the
1930s
and
mr.
grace
lived
until
1951.
when
mr.
grace
died,
the
government
contended
pursuant
to
the
lehman
case
that
the
trust
which
she
had
created
was
one
which
should
be
included
in
his
gross
estate
as
a
trust
in
which
he
had
reserved
a
life
estate.
the
trust
was
of
course
formally
created
by
her.
it
provided
for
a
life
estate
in
him.
the
estate
paid
the
tax
pursuant
to
the
demand
of
the
government.
claims
for
refund
were
filed
when
they
were
not
acted
on
within
the
six
months
that
this
suit
was
brought
in
the
court
of
claims.
the
difficulty
arises
i
think
largely
from
the
fact
that
in
the
lehman
case,
the
four
trusts
were
created
by
two
brothers,
two
each
for
the
other
as
the
result
of
an
agreement
between
them.
there
is
as
a
consequence
some
talk
in
the
lehman
opinion
to
the
effect
that
one
trust
was
created
in
consideration
of
the
other
that
there
is
a
more
talk
as
there
is
in
page
27
of
the
respondent's
brief
where
there
is
an
extensive
quotation
from
the
lehman
opinion
where
there
is
more
talk
of
how
the
decedent
by
transfer
of
his
share
to
his
brother
caused
the
brother
to
make
a
transfer
of
property
in
trust
and
could
there
be
a
clearer
case
than
this
one
that
the
decedent
caused
his
wife
janet
to
make
this
transfer.
he
drew
up
the
instruments.
he
made
the
plan.
the
court
of
claims
has
found
the
final
finding
on
page
122
and
123
of
the
record.
the
joseph
grace
trust
and
the
janet
grace
trust
were
created
by
or
at
the
instigation
of
joseph
p.
grace
as
parts
of
what
was
essentially
a
single
transaction.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
was
at
that
time,
her
own
property.
it
--
it
had
come
i
think
in
large
part
or
entirely
originally
from
him.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
do
not
believe
so
mr.
justice.
perhaps
something
could
have
been
made
to
turn
on
at
an
earlier
stage
of
the
case
but
no
intention
has
been
made
that
this
was
anything
other
than
her
property
which
she
transferred
in
trust
for
him
in
connection
with
or
almost
contemporaneously
with
a
transfer
of
property
which
she
made
in
trust
for
her.
now,
the
court
below
seized
on
this
concept
of
consideration
as
some
of
the
other
courts
have
following
the
lehman
case
and
the
respondent
basis
his
whole
argument
on
it.
if
i
am
caught
by
the
consideration
argument,
my
path
may
be
somewhat
difficult
though
i
do
not
think
that
even
then
it
is
hopeless
for
consideration
must
be
interpreted
in
the
later
the
actual
facts
of
the
case.
well,
i
don't
think
the
question
in
this
case
ought
to
be
made
to
turn
on
any
questions
of
whether
there
is
a
consideration
in
the
contract
sense
of
course
there
was
no
bargaining
here.
there
was
nothing
of
what
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
a
recent
decision
involving
a
somewhat
related
question
has
referred
to
as
treating
(inaudible).
this
was
a
question
of
mutual
gifts
not
of
bargain
at
arm's
length.
these
spouses
did
not
operate
on
that
basis
as
most
spouses
do
not
sort
of
a
divorce
settlement
and
here
there
was
never
a
divorce
and
no
property
settlement
of
that
kind.
as
the
court
of
claims
has
found
these
two
trusts
were
created
as
part
of
a
single
plan
which
was
devised
and
actuated
by
mr.
grace.
in
the
court
of
claims,
there
is
a
dissenting
opinion
by
judge
davis
who
deals
extensively
with
this
problem.
he
uses
a
good
many
other
words
page
75
of
the
record
interconnected,
page
76
mutuality
further
down
on
the
page
related
connected
and
interdependent,
page
78
he
refers
to
–-
well
it's
on
page
80,
he
refers
to
cross
trusts
are
seen
as
interdependent.
page
84
he
refers
to
the
true
reciprocity
and
interdependence
and
says
if
the
cross
trust
arrangement
was
mutual
and
interdependent,
there
is
such
a
transfer
and
on
page
85
he
refers
to
the
crossing
was
not
haphazard
but
part
of
a
single
interdependent
transaction.
reciprocal
trusts
are
in
fact
outside
the
direct
language
of
the
statute
but
the
court
in
the
lehman
case
and
in
many
other
cases
have
uncrossed
the
trust
relying
on
the
fundamental
rule
repeatedly
reaffirmed
by
this
court.
now,
the
tax
consequences
flow
from
the
economic
substance
and
effect
of
a
transaction
and
not
its
form.
this
is
rather
like
a
converse
of
the
gregory
situation.
there
the
transaction
came
within
the
literal
language
of
the
statute
but
this
court
held
that
what
was
done
was
a
mere
device
and
not
within
the
substance
or
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
this
recalls
other
expression
of
this
court
at
this
period
in
barnette
and
wells,
the
court
through
mr.
justice
cardozo
referred
to
the
record
of
the
government's
endeavor
to
keep
pace
with
the
fertility
of
invention
whereby
taxpayers
had
contrived
to
keep
the
larger
benefits
of
ownership
and
be
relieved
from
the
attended
burdens
and
shortly
thereafter
in
griffith
against
commissioner,
the
court
referred
to
a
lawyer's
ingenuity
devised
a
technically
elegant
arrangement
whereby
an
intricate
outward
appearance
was
given
in
that
case
to
make
the
thing
look
to
be
sale
rather
than
the
payment
of
a
dividend.
our
submission
is
that
the
existence
of
consideration,
the
existence
of
a
bargain
for
quid
pro
quo
is
not
the
touchstone
of
the
lehman
case
but
it
is
simply
a
question
of
whether
there
are
mutual
gifts,
whether
the
consequence
of
the
transaction
as
it
was
carried
out
is
essentially
the
same
as
it
would
be
if
mr.
grace
had
created
a
trust
for
himself
and
mrs.
grace
had
created
a
trust
for
herself
and
this
construction
of
the
reciprocal
trust
situation
has
been
confirmed
by
congress.
this
was
in
the
technical
changes
act
of
1949
following
this
court's
decision
in
the
church
and
spiegel
cases.
congress
then
provided
for
tax
free
release
of
powers
reserved
in
reciprocal
trusts,
of
powers
reserved
on
reciprocal
trusts,
effective
until
december
31,
1950,
that
was
a
little
over
a
year
after
the
statute
was
passed.
this
did
not
provide
for
tax
free
release
of
retained
life
estates
or
reciprocal
trust
estates
unless
the
trusts
had
been
irrevocably
established
before
march
3,
1931
and
that
would
not
apply
in
this
case
because
the
trusts
were
established
in
december
1931.
in
connection
with
this
1949
statute,
the
committee
reports
are
explicit.
the
senate
report
which
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
house
report
is
set
out
in
page
23
of
our
brief.
prior
to
1940,
the
senate
report
says
certain
reciprocal
trusts
were
established
with
the
apparent
intent
of
minimizing
estate
taxes
by
what
were
then
considered
effective
means
and
going
to
the
end
of
that
paragraph,
by
this
reciprocal
device
it
was
thought
that
two
persons
could
transfer
property
to
their
heirs
without
diminishing
effective
control
during
life
but
still
paying
the
gift
tax
rather
than
the
estate
tax.
and
then
the
last
paragraph
on
that
page,
however,
in
1940,
in
lehman
against
commissioner,
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
held
that
where
trusts
were
found
to
have
been
created
each
in
consideration
of
the
other,
the
nominal
grantors
are
to
be
interchanged
for
tax
purposes
and
the
court
--
the
congress
went
on
to
provide
that
there
should
be
a
limited
period
when
persons
who
in
the
sense
had
been
caught
by
that
could
release
powers
but
made
no
provision
for
releasing
life
estate
or
transferring
life
estates
in
reciprocal
trusts
unless
the
life
estate
has
been
created
before
march
3,
1931
which
was
the
date
of
the
statute
which
congress
passed
explicitly
making
taxable
the
reservation
of
a
life
estate.
now,
there
is
no
reference
to
consideration
in
these
committee
reports
or
to
a
bargain
for
or
arm's
length
transaction.
there
is
the
simple
factual
statement
an
individual
might
establish
a
trust
at
the
same
time
or
a
short
time
after
the
husband
set
up
the
trust,
his
wife
would
also
establish
a
trust
and
that
is
of
course
precisely
what
we
have
involved
here.
a
good
deal
was
made
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
claims
out
of
the
fact
that
it
was
perfectly
obvious
that
mrs.
grace
had
no
motivation
here
except
to
be
a
good
wife
to
her
husband
and
since
it
appeared
that
mrs.
grace
was
not
trying
to
save
taxes
had
no
conscious
motivation
of
an
effort
to
save
taxes
the
court
of
claims
felt
that
the
trust
could
not
come
with
the
reciprocal
trust
rule
but
we
submit
that
the
subjective
facts
that
motivated
mrs.
grace
or
mr.
grace
have
no
pertinence.
they
were
not
bargaining,
they
were
not
purchasing,
it's
obvious
that
mrs.
grace's
only
motivation
was
to
do
what
her
husband
wanted
her
to
do
which
she
did
promptly
and
cheerfully
without
harm
to
herself
as
was
always
the
case.
all
of
the
motivation,
all
of
the
decision
came
from
mr.
grace.
these
were
not
bargain
for
transfers
but
they
were
planned
transfers,
mutual
gifts,
artfully
contrived
part
of
a
single
transaction,
obviously
with
some
tax
motivation
to
get
in
ahead
of
the
gift
tax
which
was
successfully
accomplished.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice
white,
the
one
mrs.
grace
created
is
the
one
which
is
included
in
his
estate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
he
is
treated
as
the
settlor
of
the
trust
which
she
signed
which
transferred
property
upon
trust
for
him
for
life.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it's
the
value
of
that
property
which
is
included
here.
these
trusts
were
planned
by
mr.
grace
together.
they
were
executed
within
a
span
of
15
days.
they
were
virtually
identical
in
terms.
they
were
executed
in
accordance
with
the
plan
of
the
decedent
and
were
parts
of
what
was
essentially
a
single
transaction.
on
this
record,
it
is
plain
that
these
trusts
were
imminently
connected
in
their
inception
and
that
is
enough
to
invoke
the
rule
of
the
lehman
case
as
congress
has
confirmed.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
claim
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
there
is
one
point
which
i
would
like
to
clarify
and
that
is
the
suggestion
that
the
janet
grace
trust
is
being
taxed
twice.
i
think
it
also
bears
on
the
argument
of
consideration
and
rather
shows
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
mutual
gifts,
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
consideration
can
be
clarified
by
thinking
of
it
in
terms
of
value.
it
is
the
treasury's
practice
in
the
case
of
mutual
gifts
to
say
that
they
are
reciprocal
or
crossed
to
the
extent
of
mutual
value
and
if
one
of
the
trusts
is
bigger
than
the
other,
then
the
excess
is
treated
as
a
gift,
independent
of
the
other.
now,
what
happened
here
was
that
when
mrs.
grace
died,
the
question
was
should
be
included
in
her
estate?
and
i
think
that
what
was
included
in
her
estate
was
the
joseph
grace
trust,
but
to
the
extent
of
the
mutual
value.
as
the
janet
grace
trust
was
the
smaller
trust
the
mutual
value
was
determined
by
finding
the
value
of
the
janet
grace
trust
and
thus
it
was
that
part
of
the
joseph
grace
trust
which
is
measured
in
value
by
the
janet
grace
trust
which
was
included
in
the
--
in
mrs.
grace's
estate.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
was
controversial.
there
were
questions
as
to
value.
it
was
finally
settled
by
including
55%
of
the
value
but
the
significant
thing
i
think
is
that
it
is
mutual
value.
it
is
analogous
to
consideration
in
the
case
like
the
lehman
case.
it
is
appropriate
to
talk
about
consideration.
it
is
of
course
quite
true
that
the
committee
report
which
i
read
uses
the
word
consideration
but
there
still
remains
the
question
of
construing
or
interpreting
what
that
means.
i
do
not
think
that
it
means
a
bargain
for
item
something
over
which
the
parties
haggled.
i
think
it
is
fully
applicable
to
a
case
of
mutual
gifts
which
was
involved
here.
