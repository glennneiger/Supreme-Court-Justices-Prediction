what
if
the
student
that
got
enough
in
the
class
he
went
to
and
delivered
the
message
orally
that
his
armband
was
intended
to
convey
and
insisted
on
doing
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
during
the
hours?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
they
wear
the
armband
to
the
class,
to
express
that
message?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
everybody
in
the
class?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
everybody
while
they
were
listening
to
some
other
subject
matter
was
supposed
to
also
be
looking
at
the
armband
and
taking
in
that
message?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
it
and
they
were
intended
to
see
it,
wouldn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
to
understand
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
to
absorb
that
message?
justice
byron
r.
white
while
they're
studying
arithmetic
or
mathematics,
they
are
supposed
to
be
picking
in
this
message
about
vietnam.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
they're
just
wearing
a
meaningless
armband?
justice
byron
r.
white
carrying
an
ineffective
message
and
they
intended
it
to
be
ineffective?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
didn't
they
take
it
off
when
they
went
in
the
class?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
was
ineffective
nobody
would
notice?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
physically,
but
how
about
the
attention
of
the
students?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
they
wear
it
again?
why
did
they
wear
the
armband?
justice
byron
r.
white
convey
a
message
--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
anticipated
students
to
see
and
understand
and
think
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
they
did
it
in
class,
they
intended
to
do
it
in
class?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
intended
to
--
they
intended
to
use
and
think
about
it
outside
the
class
but
not
in
class?
justice
byron
r.
white
physically,
it
wouldn't
make
a
noise,
it
wouldn't
cause
a
commotion
but
don't
you
think
it
would
cause
some
people
to
direct
their
attention
of
the
armband
in
vietnam
war
and
think
about
that
rather
than
what
they
were
thinking
about
--
supposed
be
thinking
about
in
the
classroom?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
which
this
school
is
permitted
to
forbid?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
a
narrow,
a
narrower
regulation
it
says
that
you
may
not
wear
armbands
or
buttons
or
placards
in
the
classroom
would
be
sustainable
under
first
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
it
be
sustainable
if
--
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
to
take
that
position?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
why
don't
you
have
to
sustain
that
position
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
they
wore
it
in
class.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
why
shouldn't
the
question
be
were
they're
permitted
to
be
suspended
for
wearing
it
in
the
class?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
the
action
that
was
brought
was
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
against
the
--
against
any
enforcement
of
the
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
would
--
in
your
injunction
then
would
forbid
them
of
the
injunction
you
wanted,
do
you
think
you
ought
to
have,
should
forbid
the
school
from
keeping
armbands
out
of
classrooms?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
your
answer
is
yes?
you
want
the
injunction
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
and
you're
trying
to
sustain
that
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
must
be
arguing
that
the
school
may
not
keep
the
armbands
out
of
classrooms?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
the
terminiello
type
case
be
applicable
in
the
classroom?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
disruption?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
are
not
talking
just
about
violence?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
do
you
(inaudible)?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
there
could
certainly
be
some
whispering
going
on,
undertone
in
the
classroom?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
even
though
it
wasn't
disruptive
or
bothered
anybody
else
at
all,
we
didn't
make
anybody
mad
or
anything.
this
might
have
made
somebody
a
little
amused.
justice

white
well,

it

the

they

do

so,
why

whether

justice
