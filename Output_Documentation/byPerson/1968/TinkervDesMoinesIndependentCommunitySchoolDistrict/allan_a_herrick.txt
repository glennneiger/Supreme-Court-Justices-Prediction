mr.
allan
a.
herrick
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
the
respondents
believe
that
there
are
two
basic
issues
involved
here.
the
first,
the
school
administrators
are
school
boards
have
to
wait
from
until
violence,
disorder
and
disruption
break
out
and
scholarly
discipline
of
the
school
is
disrupted
or
may
they
acted
when
in
good
faith
in
their
reasonable
discretion
and
judgment,
disorder
and
disruption
of
scholarly
atmosphere
of
the
schoolroom
will
result
unless
they
act
firmly
and
properly.
the
second
issue
it
seems
to
me
is
that
this
court
must
determine
how
far
it
wants
to
go
under
the
constitutional
amendments
for
free
speech
in
reviewing
every
decision
of
every
school
district
made
in
good
faith
in
its
reasonable
discretion
and
judgment
as
necessary
to
maintain
order
and
scholarly
discipline
atmosphere
within
the
classroom.
the
third
issue,
might
be
added,
are
disturbances
or
threatened
disturbances
in
the
schools
to
be
measured
by
identical
standards
with
disturbances
or
threaten
disturbances
on
the
streets.
now,
it's
the
position
of
the
respondents
that
the
decision
of
the
school
administration
and
of
the
school
board
made
in
good
faith
under
the
circumstances
existing
when
that
decision
was
made
was
the
reasonable
exercise
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
school
authorities
and
did
not
deprive
petitioners
of
their
constitutional
right
of
free
speech.
now,
this
court
has
held
that
freedom
of
speech
including
of
course
the
right
of
demonstration
is
not
an
absolute
right
to
be
exercised
regardless
of
time
or
place.
i'm
sure
it
isn't
necessary
to
quote
to
this
court
its
own
decisions
but
a
case
of
adderley
versus
the
state
of
florida
seems
particularly
pertinent,
where
the
students
went
from
the
university
to
the
jail
grounds
to
protest
the
arrest
of
students
who
had
been
arrested
the
day
before
and
their
claim
was
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
in
the
adderley
case?
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
it
was
a
large
quite
a
large
number.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
there
were
--
that's
a
question
your
honor,
of
what
you
mean
by
involved.
there
are
18
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
there
were
five
suspended
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
--
who
are
wearing
armbands
your
honor.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes,
i
think
there
were
two
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
they
weren't
accepted
and
i'll
refer
to
that
a
little
later.
they
were
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think
if
the
court
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
--
please
that
that
doesn't
gives
us
the
entire
background
that
builds
up
to
what
was
existing
in
the
des
moines
schools
at
the
time
the
armbands
were
worn.
the
--
as
we
view
it
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech
or
the
right
of
demonstration
in
the
school
room
and
on
the
school
premises
must
be
weighed
against
the
right
of
the
school
administration
to
make
a
decision
which
the
administration
in
good
faith
believe
in
its
discretion
was
reasonable
to
preserve
order
and
to
avoid
this
disturbance
and
disruption
in
the
school
room.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i'll
refer
to
that
also
your
honor.
there
had
been
with
john
tinker
what
i
would
call
disruption.
there
were
one
or
two
of
the
boys
who
have
been
struck,
i
believe
the
record
shows.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
think
the
question
there
is
and
gets
back
to
the
first
issue
that
i
undertook
in
the
states.
does
the
school
if
we
have
an
aroused
community
have
to
wait
until
disruption
occurs
or
may
it
act
to
prevent
it?
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think
i
can
point
that
out,
if
the
court
please.
in
the
background
of
this
case,
in
november
of
1965,
the
petitioner,
christopher
eckhardt
with
his
mother
who
was
president
of
the
des
moines
chapter
of
the
women's
international
league
for
peace
and
freedom,
had
come
to
washington
d.c.
to
participate
with
the
students
for
democratic
society,
dr.
spock
and
others
in
the
march,
which
i'm
sure
this
court
is
familiar
with
from
the
white
house
to
the
washington
monument.
now,
that
was
in
november
i
think
about
thanksgiving
holiday.
on
saturday,
december
11,
1965
following
this
march,
a
group
which
included
students
related
to
the
students
for
a
democratic
society
and
some
adults
met
at
the
eckhardt
home
and
one
of
the
proposals
that
developed
this
meeting
was
the
wearing
of
these
black
armbands.
none
of
these
petitioners
were
present.
now,
as
the
trial
court
said
and
this
is
on
page
73
of
the
appendix,
the
last
paragraph,
that
vietnam
war
and
the
involvement
of
the
united
states
therein
has
been
a
subject
of
a
major
controversy
for
some
time.
when
the
armband
regulation
involved
herein
was
promulgated,
debate
over
the
vietnam
war
had
become
vehement
in
many
localities.
a
protest
march
against
the
war
had
recently
been
held
in
washington
d.c.
a
wave
of
draft
card
burning
incidents
protesting
the
war
had
swept
the
country.
at
that
time,
two
highly
publicized
draft
card
burning
cases
were
pending
in
this
court
both
individual
supporting
the
war
and
those
opposing
it
were
quite
vocal
in
expressing
their
views.
this
was
demonstrated
during
the
school
board's
hearing
on
the
armband
regulation.
and
that
appears
also
in
the
record,
i
think
some
200
had
gathered
who
were
many
of
them
are
outsiders
at
the
time
of
the
school
board
hearing.
this
hearing
the
school
board
voted
in
support
of
the
rule
prohibiting
the
wearing
of
the
black
--
wearing
of
armbands
in
school
premises.
it
is
against
this
background.
the
court
must
review
the
reasonableness
of
the
regulation.
now,
this
is
the
background
that
faced
the
superintendent
of
schools.
this
thing
had
become
a
matter
through
the
press
and
through
the
community
and
the
superintendent
directed
doctor
peterson
who
was
the
director
of
secondary
education,
to
call
a
meeting
of
the
principals
on
december
14,
1965.
and
with
this
background
and
at
this
meeting,
their
principals
in
the
good
faith,
using
their
discretion
in
best
judgment
decided
that
to
maintain
discipline
and
avoid
disruption,
the
wearing
of
the
armbands
in
the
schoolroom
should
not
be
permitted.
now,
on
page
46
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
oh!
i
would
anticipate,
your
honor,
that
probably
would've
been
any
question
about
it
unless
they
had
build
it
up
to
a
point
where
they
were
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think,
your
honor,
if
we
get
all
these
back
to
the
same
problem
whether
under
the
circumstance
it's
difficult
to
set
in
this
court
or
to
stand
in
this
court
and
say
what
face
the
schools
out
in
des
moines
in
the
enactment
of
this
--
making
this
decision
against
the
wearing
of
armbands.
it
was
a
--
an
inflammatory
matter
at
that
time.
now,
dr.peterson,
the
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
oh!
i
think
that's
true
your
honor.
but
i
think
the
place
for
that
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
correct
answer
of
that
is
free
discussion
in
the
classroom
is
always
permitted,
always
has
been
if
they
want
to
come
in
and
discuss
these
matters.
but
the
question
of
imposing
on
a
captive
audience
moving
in
with
an
armband
when
it's
known
through
the
press,
through
the
community,
through
the
things
that
have
happened
here
that
the
community
is
inflamed
might
disrupt
the
orderly
conduct
of
schools.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
the
court
said
this,
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
it's
on
page
75.
after
due
considerations,
it's
the
view
of
the
court
that
the
actions
of
the
school
officials
in
this
realm
should
not
be
limited
to
those
instances
where
there's
been
a
material
or
substantial
interference
with
the
school
discipline.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
--
immediately.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
here
your
honor,
it's
on
page
72
your
honor.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes.
the
question
which
must
now
be
determined
is
whether
the
action
of
the
officials
of
the
defendant
school
district
forbidding
the
wearing
of
armbands
on
school
facilities
deprive
the
plaintiffs
of
constitutional
rights
secured
by
the
freedom
of
speech
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
and
an
individual's
right
of
free
speech
is
protected
against
infringement
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
gitlow
versus
new
york,
268
u.s.
652.
the
wearing
of
an
armband
for
the
purpose
of
expressing
certain
views
is
a
symbolic
act
and
falls
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
free
speech
clause,
west
virginia
state
board
of
education
versus
barnette.
however,
the
protections
of
that
clause
are
not
absolute.
the
abridgment
of
speech
by
state
regulation
must
also
--
always
be
considered
in
terms
of
the
object,
the
regulation
is
attempting
to
accomplish
and
the
abridgment
of
speech
that
actually
occurs.
in
each
case,
the
courts
must
ask
whether
the
gravity
of
the
evil
discounted
by
its
improbability
justifies
such
invasion
of
free
speech
as
is
necessary
to
avoid
danger.
officials
of
the
defendant's
school
district
have
the
responsibility
for
maintaining
a
scholarly,
disciplined
atmosphere
within
the
classroom.
these
officials
not
only
have
a
right,
they
have
an
obligation
to
prevent
anything
which
might
be
disruptive
for
such
an
atmosphere.
unless
the
actions
of
school
boards
--
officials
in
this
connection
are
unreasonable,
the
court
should
not
interfere.
now
does
that
answer
what
your
honor
had
in
mind?
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
now,
in
this
case,
counsel
has
already
referred
to
the
fact.
christopher
eckhardt
went
to
roosevelt
high
school
wearing
the
black
armband.
he
is
the
one
as
i
have
stated
with
his
mother
have
been
down
here
on
the
march.
they
came
back
and
they
had
the
meeting
at
which
he
didn't
attend.
adults
held
the
meeting.
when
christopher
came
to
school
he
was
asked
by
a
student
if
he
knew
there
was
a
rule
against
wearing
the
armband
that
he
said
he
did
and
he
went
directly
to
the
principal's
office
in
defiance
of
the
rule
because,
as
he
said,
he
thought
they
might
suspend
him.
now,
mr.
blackmun
who
was
the
vice
principal
asked
christopher
to
remove
the
armband
and
he
refused.
now,
after
considerable
discussion,
mr.
blackmun
finally
called
christopher's
mother
and
told
her
that
he
would
have
to
suspend
christopher
for
wearing
the
armband
and
of
refusing
to
abide
by
the
school's
regulation.
and
mrs.
eckhardt's
reply
was
that
christopher
had
a
constitutional
right
to
wear
the
armband.
now,
the
other
two
petitioners,
john
f.
tinker
and
mary
beth
tinker
bring
this
action
by
their
father
reverend
leonard
tinker
who
is
secretary
for
peace
and
education
of
the
american
friend's
service
committee.
and
i
think
it
of
some
significance
here.
i
don't
in
any
sense
feel
that
it
is
controlling
the
constitutional
right
exists
you've
got,
period.
but
paul
tinker
who
was
eight
years
old
went
to
school
with
a
black
armband,
hope
tinker
who
was
11
years
old
went
to
school
with
a
black
armband,
and
the
petitioner
mary
beth
tinker
who
was
13
went
to
school
with
a
black
armband.
john
tinker
is
15,
he
went
to
school
of
a
black
armband.
now
reverend
tinker
testified
that
he
had
to
support
them
in
what
he
considered
the
exercise
of
their
conscience
and
their
own
constitutional
rights.
now,
respondents
do
not
question
that
the
students
for
a
democratic
society
or
that
reverend
tinker
as
the
secretary
for
peach
and
education
of
the
friend's
society
or
mrs.
eckhardt
as
the
local
president
of
the
international
league
for
peace
and
freedom
are
entitled
to
express
their
views
under
their
constitutional
right
of
free
speech.
but
the
point
is
not
at
every
time,
not
at
every
place
and
particularly
not
under
the
circumstances
that
existed
in
this
case,
not
in
the
schoolroom
at
a
time
when
it
might
result
in
disruption
and
might
even
result
in
violence.
now,
in
substance
if
we
understand
the
petitioner's
position
in
this
case
it
is
that
the
school
officials
are
powerless
to
act
until
the
disruption
occurs.
respondents
believe
that
should
not
be
the
rule.
sometimes
per
an
ounce
of
prevention
is
a
lot
better
than
a
pound
of
cure
and
i
think
subsequent
history
of
such
activities
about
the
judgment
of
the
school
officials
in
their
discretion.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
not
at
all.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
not
at
all.
they
could
proscribe
i
think
the
classroom
and
the
time
and
the
place
where
the
matters
would
be
discussed
and
that
if
the
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think
if
the
court
please,
if
it
were
done
as
i
think
the
record
in
this
case
shows
where
they
come
in
or
the
whole
row
of
buttons
on
something
of
that
sort
that
it
could
prove
disruptive.
it's
a
matter
of
dress.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
no.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
no,
but
it
would
be
any
what
--
would
there
be
any
question
if
they
walked
in
of
a
placard
and
said,
we
protest
the
vietnam
war
and
that
was
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
that
--
under
the
circumstances
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
normally
yes,
and
but
i
think
normally
but
i
say
this,
this
thing
had
been
extensively
exploited
in
the
press.
we
had
a
situation
here
where
it
was
explosive.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
alright,
if
the
court
please,
i
refer
first,
i
think
here
to
the
john
tinker
for
just
a
moment.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
that
would
be
on
page
18
of
the
appendix.
it
really
starts
possibly
on
the
first
page.
he
went
to
the
first
two
classes.
he
didn't
think
the
instructor
saw
it
and
he
said,
he
sat
in
the
back
of
a
class,
i
believe,
in
the
second
class
which
was
10:30
before
noon
and
he
didn't
think
any
body
saw
it.
and
he
said,
that's
in
the
bottom
of
page
of
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
saw
the
black
armband,
that's
correct,
because
he
sat
in
the
back
of
a
class.
then
he
went
to
gym
class
and
he
said
that
on
the
way
to
gym
class,
there
wasn't
any
discussion.
there
was
hardly
no
one
around.
that's
the
way
it's
stated
here.
“after
gym
class,
some
of
the
students
were
making
fun
of
me
for
wearing
it.
others
who
were
my
friends
made
remarks
in
the
locker
room
that
were
not
very
friendly.
after
others
who
are
my
friends
said,
they
didn't
want
me
to
get
in
trouble.”
two
or
three
boys
made
remarks
in
the
locker
room,
i
beg
your
pardon,
it
was
that
part
i'm
repeating.
“this
lasted
perhaps
three
or
four
meetings.
they
did
not
threaten
me
with
any
physical
harm
after
gym
class,
i
had
half
an
hour
for
lunch.
i
ate
lunch
in
the
student's
center
with
several
other
students
with
who
i
meet
frequently.
these
people
warned
me
in
a
friendly
manner
to
take
the
armband
off.
there
was
one
student
whom
i
had
a
feud
in
the
7th
grade
who
was
making
smart
remarks
for
about
10
minutes.
there
were
four
or
five
people
with
him
standing
milling
around.
there
were
quite
a
few
other
students
standing
and
milling
around
the
lunchroom.
to
my
knowledge,
there
were
no
threats
to
hit
me
or
anything
like
that.
at
no
time
was
i
in
fear
that
they
might
attack
me
or
hit
in
the
student
center
because
there
were
too
many
people
there.”
now,
it
was
right
after
lunch,
the
exposure
we
frankly
concede
here
on
the
matter
of
disruption
was
very
brief
because
here
christopher
eckhardt
went
to
the
principal's
office
and
this
to
have
about
given
you
what
happened
to
john
tinker.
but
he
said
he
want
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
don't
know
and
i
see
i
believe
it's
page
62.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
that's
a
pretty
close
question
your
honor
as
--
i
don't
think
this,
if
the
court
says
there
has
to
be
disruption,
i
don't
believe
that's
the
test.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
feel
that
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
but
i
feel
the
test
goes
one
step
further
than
that.
in
the
reasonable
judgment
of
the
school
administrators
and
the
school
board,
if
there
are
reasonable
judgment
disruption
were
threatened.
at
that
point,
it's
our
idea
that
they
are
entitled
to
act.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
without
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes
of
course.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
of
course
it
is.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well
on
page
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
sixty-two
and
this
is
from
the
deposition
of
john
tinker.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
sixty-two
toward
the
bottom
of
the
page.
“i
attended
the
meeting
of
some
50
people
at
the
building
where
my
father's
office
and
there
is
some
accounts
of
some
students
there
as
to
physical
violence
had
been
inflicted
upon
them
over
wearing
these
armbands.”
either
bruce
clark
or
ross,
bruce
clark
was
one
of
the
suspended
five
said
somebody
had
struck
him
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
it
says
portion
of
the
deposition
of
john
tinker
down
below
there.
“i
attended
the

either

or

had
some
but
said,
somebody
had
struck
him
could've
been
both
of
them.
i
was
there
and
recall
a
hearing
somebody
say
that.”
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
that
that
is
true
because
i
wouldn't
know
depending
on
how
it
was
brought
to
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
that
would
sound
reasonable,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
no,
i
think
your
honor
that
the
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think
as
i've
stated
before,
your
honor
that
it
was
a
matter
of
the
explosive
situation
that
existed
in
the
des
moines
schools
at
the
time
the
regulation
was
adopted.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
alright.
this
is
page
70
at
the
top
of
the
appendix.
a
former
student
of
one
of
our
high
schools
was
killed
in
vietnam.
some
of
his
friends
are
still
in
the
school.
it
was
felt
that
of
any
kind
of
a
demonstration
existed,
it
might
evolve
into
something
which
would
be
difficult
to
control.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
no,
i
think
not
your
honor.
but
i
don't
think
it
would
be
an
explosive
situation
in
most
cases
but
if
someone
who's
trying
to
appear
in
the
court
with
an
armband
here
protesting
the
thing
that
it
could
be
explosive,
that's
the
situation
we
find.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
what?
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes,
sir.
it
could
be.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
i
think
the
rule
that
maybe
i
can
express,
i
think
there's
an
arkansas
case
that
i
have
referred
to
that
expresses
what
we
feel
should
be
the
rule
and
this
is
in
the
respondent's
brief
on
page
28.
and
this
again
was
a
case
where
the
plaintiff
was
suspended
from
school
for
violating
a
school
rule
forbidding
the
use
of
paint
--
face
paint
and
cosmetics.
and
she
brought
the
mandamus
to
require
her
admission
to
school
notwithstanding
her
refusal
to
obey
the
rule.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
i
can't
answer
that
your
honor.
it
was
an
expression
certainly.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
no.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
what
was
involved
though,
i
think
your
honor,
is
that
it
was
disruptive
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
schoolroom
and
it's
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
no,
i
don't
believe
i
admitted
that
your
honor.
i
think
if
the
situation
broke
down
the
discipline
of
the
school
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
if
i
did,
i
could
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
oh!
they
would
and
the
--
you
assume
the
record
here
that
free
discussion
in
school
with
these
matters
are
permitted.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think
so
long
as
it
doesn't
interrupt
or
disrupt
the
atmosphere
in
the
school.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think
within
the
reason
that's
true.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i'd
go
further
than
that
your
honor.
i
would
say
today
maybe
they
could
the
same
proposition
come
up
if
the
atmosphere
is
different
should
be
permitted.
my
only
claim
here
is
that
what
existed
here,
that
the
school
administration
and
the
school
board
acted
reasonably
and
within
their
discretion,
at
that
time
it
could
be
very
different
today
demonstrations
at
another
time
that
might
not
be
explosive.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
no,
sir.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
no,
i
think
that
that
is
not
correct.
if
i've
given
that
impression
i'm
sorry.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
no,
i
don't
believe
that.
i
believe
the
schools
are
there
to
give
these
children
an
education
and
i
think
des
moines
is
one
of
the
great
spots
in
the
nation
where
they've
done
it.
and
i
feel
that
anything
that
threatens
that
type
of
scholarly
atmosphere
in
the
classroom
ought
to
be
prohibited.
my
time
is
up.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
that's
a
question.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
that's
correct
your
honor.
so,
they
haven't
forbad
it
in
the
schools
but
mathematics
after
all
was
ought
out
to
be
taught
in
a
mathematics
class.
and
i
think
they're
entitled
to
regulate
it.
that's
what
this
is
as
a
regulation.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think
there
was
a
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
--
iron
crosses,
i
think
some
times
they've
worn
political
buttons
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
of
course,
meyer
against
nebraska
is
forbidding
and
teaching
the
german
language,
as
i
recall
it,
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
i
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
surely.
again,
your
honor,
i
have
to
come
back
to
the
situation
that
your
--
that
the
court
really
doesn't
sit
down
in
the
situation
that
the
school
administration
of
the
school
board
does.
they've
got
to
say,
is
this
so
unreasonable
as
to
violate
the
constitutional
right?
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think
we're
getting
very
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
my
opinion
is
that
if
the
court
undertakes
to
go
that
far,
you're
getting
in
to
very
difficult
field
of
trying
to
say
in
every
instance
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
--
whether
a
regulation
is
or
is
not
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
and
i
think
some
things
have
got
to
be
left,
judgment
of
the
administrators.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
that's
correct.
i
say
this
your
honor
i
think
every
case
must
be
reviewed
on
its
own
facts
and
i
think
that's
the
difficulty
in
this
court
getting
into
the
situation.
i'm
trying
to
regulate
it
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
mr.
chief
justice
and
associate
justices.
the
respondents
believe
that
there
are
two
basic
issues
involved
here.
the
first,
the
school
administrators
are
school
boards
have
to
wait
from
until
violence,
disorder
and
disruption
break
out
and
scholarly
discipline
of
the
school
is
disrupted
or
may
they
acted
when
in
good
faith
in
their
reasonable
discretion
and
judgment,
disorder
and
disruption
of
scholarly
atmosphere
of
the
schoolroom
will
result
unless
they
act
firmly
and
properly.
the
second
issue
it
seems
to
me
is
that
this
court
must
determine
how
far
it
wants
to
go
under
the
constitutional
amendments
for
free
speech
in
reviewing
every
decision
of
every
school
district
made
in
good
faith
in
its
reasonable
discretion
and
judgment
as
necessary
to
maintain
order
and
scholarly
discipline
atmosphere
within
the
classroom.
the
third
issue,
might
be
added,
are
disturbances
or
threatened
disturbances
in
the
schools
to
be
measured
by
identical
standards
with
disturbances
or
threaten
disturbances
on
the
streets.
now,
it's
the
position
of
the
respondents
that
the
decision
of
the
school
administration
and
of
the
school
board
made
in
good
faith
under
the
circumstances
existing
when
that
decision
was
made
was
the
reasonable
exercise
of
discretion
on
the
part
of
school
authorities
and
did
not
deprive
petitioners
of
their
constitutional
right
of
free
speech.
now,
this
court
has
held
that
freedom
of
speech
including
of
course
the
right
of
demonstration
is
not
an
absolute
right
to
be
exercised
regardless
of
time
or
place.
i'm
sure
it
isn't
necessary
to
quote
to
this
court
its
own
decisions
but
a
case
of
adderley
versus
the
state
of
florida
seems
particularly
pertinent,
where
the
students
went
from
the
university
to
the
jail
grounds
to
protest
the
arrest
of
students
who
had
been
arrested
the
day
before
and
their
claim
was
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
in
the
adderley
case?
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
it
was
a
large
quite
a
large
number.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
there
were
--
that's
a
question
your
honor,
of
what
you
mean
by
involved.
there
are
18
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
there
were
five
suspended
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
--
who
are
wearing
armbands
your
honor.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes,
i
think
there
were
two
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
they
weren't
accepted
and
i'll
refer
to
that
a
little
later.
they
were
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think
if
the
court
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
--
please
that
that
doesn't
gives
us
the
entire
background
that
builds
up
to
what
was
existing
in
the
des
moines
schools
at
the
time
the
armbands
were
worn.
the
--
as
we
view
it
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech
or
the
right
of
demonstration
in
the
school
room
and
on
the
school
premises
must
be
weighed
against
the
right
of
the
school
administration
to
make
a
decision
which
the
administration
in
good
faith
believe
in
its
discretion
was
reasonable
to
preserve
order
and
to
avoid
this
disturbance
and
disruption
in
the
school
room.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i'll
refer
to
that
also
your
honor.
there
had
been
with
john
tinker
what
i
would
call
disruption.
there
were
one
or
two
of
the
boys
who
have
been
struck,
i
believe
the
record
shows.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
if
the
court
please,
i
think
the
question
there
is
and
gets
back
to
the
first
issue
that
i
undertook
in
the
states.
does
the
school
if
we
have
an
aroused
community
have
to
wait
until
disruption
occurs
or
may
it
act
to
prevent
it?
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think
i
can
point
that
out,
if
the
court
please.
in
the
background
of
this
case,
in
november
of
1965,
the
petitioner,
christopher
eckhardt
with
his
mother
who
was
president
of
the
des
moines
chapter
of
the
women's
international
league
for
peace
and
freedom,
had
come
to
washington
d.c.
to
participate
with
the
students
for
democratic
society,
dr.
spock
and
others
in
the
march,
which
i'm
sure
this
court
is
familiar
with
from
the
white
house
to
the
washington
monument.
now,
that
was
in
november
i
think
about
thanksgiving
holiday.
on
saturday,
december
11,
1965
following
this
march,
a
group
which
included
students
related
to
the
students
for
a
democratic
society
and
some
adults
met
at
the
eckhardt
home
and
one
of
the
proposals
that
developed
this
meeting
was
the
wearing
of
these
black
armbands.
none
of
these
petitioners
were
present.
now,
as
the
trial
court
said
and
this
is
on
page
73
of
the
appendix,
the
last
paragraph,
that
vietnam
war
and
the
involvement
of
the
united
states
therein
has
been
a
subject
of
a
major
controversy
for
some
time.
when
the
armband
regulation
involved
herein
was
promulgated,
debate
over
the
vietnam
war
had
become
vehement
in
many
localities.
a
protest
march
against
the
war
had
recently
been
held
in
washington
d.c.
a
wave
of
draft
card
burning
incidents
protesting
the
war
had
swept
the
country.
at
that
time,
two
highly
publicized
draft
card
burning
cases
were
pending
in
this
court
both
individual
supporting
the
war
and
those
opposing
it
were
quite
vocal
in
expressing
their
views.
this
was
demonstrated
during
the
school
board's
hearing
on
the
armband
regulation.
and
that
appears
also
in
the
record,
i
think
some
200
had
gathered
who
were
many
of
them
are
outsiders
at
the
time
of
the
school
board
hearing.
this
hearing
the
school
board
voted
in
support
of
the
rule
prohibiting
the
wearing
of
the
black
--
wearing
of
armbands
in
school
premises.
it
is
against
this
background.
the
court
must
review
the
reasonableness
of
the
regulation.
now,
this
is
the
background
that
faced
the
superintendent
of
schools.
this
thing
had
become
a
matter
through
the
press
and
through
the
community
and
the
superintendent
directed
doctor
peterson
who
was
the
director
of
secondary
education,
to
call
a
meeting
of
the
principals
on
december
14,
1965.
and
with
this
background
and
at
this
meeting,
their
principals
in
the
good
faith,
using
their
discretion
in
best
judgment
decided
that
to
maintain
discipline
and
avoid
disruption,
the
wearing
of
the
armbands
in
the
schoolroom
should
not
be
permitted.
now,
on
page
46
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
oh!
i
would
anticipate,
your
honor,
that
probably
would've
been
any
question
about
it
unless
they
had
build
it
up
to
a
point
where
they
were
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think,
your
honor,
if
we
get
all
these
back
to
the
same
problem
whether
under
the
circumstance
it's
difficult
to
set
in
this
court
or
to
stand
in
this
court
and
say
what
face
the
schools
out
in
des
moines
in
the
enactment
of
this
--
making
this
decision
against
the
wearing
of
armbands.
it
was
a
--
an
inflammatory
matter
at
that
time.
now,
dr.peterson,
the
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
oh!
i
think
that's
true
your
honor.
but
i
think
the
place
for
that
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
correct
answer
of
that
is
free
discussion
in
the
classroom
is
always
permitted,
always
has
been
if
they
want
to
come
in
and
discuss
these
matters.
but
the
question
of
imposing
on
a
captive
audience
moving
in
with
an
armband
when
it's
known
through
the
press,
through
the
community,
through
the
things
that
have
happened
here
that
the
community
is
inflamed
might
disrupt
the
orderly
conduct
of
schools.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
the
court
said
this,
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
it's
on
page
75.
after
due
considerations,
it's
the
view
of
the
court
that
the
actions
of
the
school
officials
in
this
realm
should
not
be
limited
to
those
instances
where
there's
been
a
material
or
substantial
interference
with
the
school
discipline.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes,
i
think
that's
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
--
immediately.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
here
your
honor,
it's
on
page
72
your
honor.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes.
the
question
which
must
now
be
determined
is
whether
the
action
of
the
officials
of
the
defendant
school
district
forbidding
the
wearing
of
armbands
on
school
facilities
deprive
the
plaintiffs
of
constitutional
rights
secured
by
the
freedom
of
speech
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
and
an
individual's
right
of
free
speech
is
protected
against
infringement
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
gitlow
versus
new
york,
268
u.s.
652.
the
wearing
of
an
armband
for
the
purpose
of
expressing
certain
views
is
a
symbolic
act
and
falls
within
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment
free
speech
clause,
west
virginia
state
board
of
education
versus
barnette.
however,
the
protections
of
that
clause
are
not
absolute.
the
abridgment
of
speech
by
state
regulation
must
also
--
always
be
considered
in
terms
of
the
object,
the
regulation
is
attempting
to
accomplish
and
the
abridgment
of
speech
that
actually
occurs.
in
each
case,
the
courts
must
ask
whether
the
gravity
of
the
evil
discounted
by
its
improbability
justifies
such
invasion
of
free
speech
as
is
necessary
to
avoid
danger.
officials
of
the
defendant's
school
district
have
the
responsibility
for
maintaining
a
scholarly,
disciplined
atmosphere
within
the
classroom.
these
officials
not
only
have
a
right,
they
have
an
obligation
to
prevent
anything
which
might
be
disruptive
for
such
an
atmosphere.
unless
the
actions
of
school
boards
--
officials
in
this
connection
are
unreasonable,
the
court
should
not
interfere.
now
does
that
answer
what
your
honor
had
in
mind?
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
now,
in
this
case,
counsel
has
already
referred
to
the
fact.
christopher
eckhardt
went
to
roosevelt
high
school
wearing
the
black
armband.
he
is
the
one
as
i
have
stated
with
his
mother
have
been
down
here
on
the
march.
they
came
back
and
they
had
the
meeting
at
which
he
didn't
attend.
adults
held
the
meeting.
when
christopher
came
to
school
he
was
asked
by
a
student
if
he
knew
there
was
a
rule
against
wearing
the
armband
that
he
said
he
did
and
he
went
directly
to
the
principal's
office
in
defiance
of
the
rule
because,
as
he
said,
he
thought
they
might
suspend
him.
now,
mr.
blackmun
who
was
the
vice
principal
asked
christopher
to
remove
the
armband
and
he
refused.
now,
after
considerable
discussion,
mr.
blackmun
finally
called
christopher's
mother
and
told
her
that
he
would
have
to
suspend
christopher
for
wearing
the
armband
and
of
refusing
to
abide
by
the
school's
regulation.
and
mrs.
eckhardt's
reply
was
that
christopher
had
a
constitutional
right
to
wear
the
armband.
now,
the
other
two
petitioners,
john
f.
tinker
and
mary
beth
tinker
bring
this
action
by
their
father
reverend
leonard
tinker
who
is
secretary
for
peace
and
education
of
the
american
friend's
service
committee.
and
i
think
it
of
some
significance
here.
i
don't
in
any
sense
feel
that
it
is
controlling
the
constitutional
right
exists
you've
got,
period.
but
paul
tinker
who
was
eight
years
old
went
to
school
with
a
black
armband,
hope
tinker
who
was
11
years
old
went
to
school
with
a
black
armband,
and
the
petitioner
mary
beth
tinker
who
was
13
went
to
school
with
a
black
armband.
john
tinker
is
15,
he
went
to
school
of
a
black
armband.
now
reverend
tinker
testified
that
he
had
to
support
them
in
what
he
considered
the
exercise
of
their
conscience
and
their
own
constitutional
rights.
now,
respondents
do
not
question
that
the
students
for
a
democratic
society
or
that
reverend
tinker
as
the
secretary
for
peach
and
education
of
the
friend's
society
or
mrs.
eckhardt
as
the
local
president
of
the
international
league
for
peace
and
freedom
are
entitled
to
express
their
views
under
their
constitutional
right
of
free
speech.
but
the
point
is
not
at
every
time,
not
at
every
place
and
particularly
not
under
the
circumstances
that
existed
in
this
case,
not
in
the
schoolroom
at
a
time
when
it
might
result
in
disruption
and
might
even
result
in
violence.
now,
in
substance
if
we
understand
the
petitioner's
position
in
this
case
it
is
that
the
school
officials
are
powerless
to
act
until
the
disruption
occurs.
respondents
believe
that
should
not
be
the
rule.
sometimes
per
an
ounce
of
prevention
is
a
lot
better
than
a
pound
of
cure
and
i
think
subsequent
history
of
such
activities
about
the
judgment
of
the
school
officials
in
their
discretion.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
not
at
all.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
not
at
all.
they
could
proscribe
i
think
the
classroom
and
the
time
and
the
place
where
the
matters
would
be
discussed
and
that
if
the
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think
if
the
court
please,
if
it
were
done
as
i
think
the
record
in
this
case
shows
where
they
come
in
or
the
whole
row
of
buttons
on
something
of
that
sort
that
it
could
prove
disruptive.
it's
a
matter
of
dress.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
no.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
no,
but
it
would
be
any
what
--
would
there
be
any
question
if
they
walked
in
of
a
placard
and
said,
we
protest
the
vietnam
war
and
that
was
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
that
--
under
the
circumstances
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
normally
yes,
and
but
i
think
normally
but
i
say
this,
this
thing
had
been
extensively
exploited
in
the
press.
we
had
a
situation
here
where
it
was
explosive.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
alright,
if
the
court
please,
i
refer
first,
i
think
here
to
the
john
tinker
for
just
a
moment.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
that
would
be
on
page
18
of
the
appendix.
it
really
starts
possibly
on
the
first
page.
he
went
to
the
first
two
classes.
he
didn't
think
the
instructor
saw
it
and
he
said,
he
sat
in
the
back
of
a
class,
i
believe,
in
the
second
class
which
was
10:30
before
noon
and
he
didn't
think
any
body
saw
it.
and
he
said,
that's
in
the
bottom
of
page
of
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
saw
the
black
armband,
that's
correct,
because
he
sat
in
the
back
of
a
class.
then
he
went
to
gym
class
and
he
said
that
on
the
way
to
gym
class,
there
wasn't
any
discussion.
there
was
hardly
no
one
around.
that's
the
way
it's
stated
here.
“after
gym
class,
some
of
the
students
were
making
fun
of
me
for
wearing
it.
others
who
were
my
friends
made
remarks
in
the
locker
room
that
were
not
very
friendly.
after
others
who
are
my
friends
said,
they
didn't
want
me
to
get
in
trouble.”
two
or
three
boys
made
remarks
in
the
locker
room,
i
beg
your
pardon,
it
was
that
part
i'm
repeating.
“this
lasted
perhaps
three
or
four
meetings.
they
did
not
threaten
me
with
any
physical
harm
after
gym
class,
i
had
half
an
hour
for
lunch.
i
ate
lunch
in
the
student's
center
with
several
other
students
with
who
i
meet
frequently.
these
people
warned
me
in
a
friendly
manner
to
take
the
armband
off.
there
was
one
student
whom
i
had
a
feud
in
the
7th
grade
who
was
making
smart
remarks
for
about
10
minutes.
there
were
four
or
five
people
with
him
standing
milling
around.
there
were
quite
a
few
other
students
standing
and
milling
around
the
lunchroom.
to
my
knowledge,
there
were
no
threats
to
hit
me
or
anything
like
that.
at
no
time
was
i
in
fear
that
they
might
attack
me
or
hit
in
the
student
center
because
there
were
too
many
people
there.”
now,
it
was
right
after
lunch,
the
exposure
we
frankly
concede
here
on
the
matter
of
disruption
was
very
brief
because
here
christopher
eckhardt
went
to
the
principal's
office
and
this
to
have
about
given
you
what
happened
to
john
tinker.
but
he
said
he
want
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
don't
know
and
i
see
i
believe
it's
page
62.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
that's
a
pretty
close
question
your
honor
as
--
i
don't
think
this,
if
the
court
says
there
has
to
be
disruption,
i
don't
believe
that's
the
test.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
feel
that
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
but
i
feel
the
test
goes
one
step
further
than
that.
in
the
reasonable
judgment
of
the
school
administrators
and
the
school
board,
if
there
are
reasonable
judgment
disruption
were
threatened.
at
that
point,
it's
our
idea
that
they
are
entitled
to
act.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
without
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes
of
course.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
of
course
it
is.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well
on
page
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
sixty-two
and
this
is
from
the
deposition
of
john
tinker.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
sixty-two
toward
the
bottom
of
the
page.
“i
attended
the
meeting
of
some
50
people
at
the
building
where
my
father's
office
and
there
is
some
accounts
of
some
students
there
as
to
physical
violence
had
been
inflicted
upon
them
over
wearing
these
armbands.”
either
bruce
clark
or
ross,
bruce
clark
was
one
of
the
suspended
five
said
somebody
had
struck
him
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
it
says
portion
of
the
deposition
of
john
tinker
down
below
there.
“i
attended
the
meeting
of
some
50
people
at
the
building
where
my
father's
office
and
there
were
some
accounts
of
some
students
there
as
to
physical
violence
that
had
been
inflicted
upon
them
over
wearing
these
armbands.
either
bruce
clark
or
ross
had
some
but
said,
somebody
had
struck
him
could've
been
both
of
them.
i
was
there
and
recall
a
hearing
somebody
say
that.”
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
wouldn't
want
to
say
that
that
is
true
because
i
wouldn't
know
depending
on
how
it
was
brought
to
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
that
would
sound
reasonable,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
no,
i
think
your
honor
that
the
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think
as
i've
stated
before,
your
honor
that
it
was
a
matter
of
the
explosive
situation
that
existed
in
the
des
moines
schools
at
the
time
the
regulation
was
adopted.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
alright.
this
is
page
70
at
the
top
of
the
appendix.
a
former
student
of
one
of
our
high
schools
was
killed
in
vietnam.
some
of
his
friends
are
still
in
the
school.
it
was
felt
that
of
any
kind
of
a
demonstration
existed,
it
might
evolve
into
something
which
would
be
difficult
to
control.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
no,
i
think
not
your
honor.
but
i
don't
think
it
would
be
an
explosive
situation
in
most
cases
but
if
someone
who's
trying
to
appear
in
the
court
with
an
armband
here
protesting
the
thing
that
it
could
be
explosive,
that's
the
situation
we
find.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
what?
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes,
sir.
it
could
be.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
i
think
the
rule
that
maybe
i
can
express,
i
think
there's
an
arkansas
case
that
i
have
referred
to
that
expresses
what
we
feel
should
be
the
rule
and
this
is
in
the
respondent's
brief
on
page
28.
and
this
again
was
a
case
where
the
plaintiff
was
suspended
from
school
for
violating
a
school
rule
forbidding
the
use
of
paint
--
face
paint
and
cosmetics.
and
she
brought
the
mandamus
to
require
her
admission
to
school
notwithstanding
her
refusal
to
obey
the
rule.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
i
can't
answer
that
your
honor.
it
was
an
expression
certainly.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
no.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
what
was
involved
though,
i
think
your
honor,
is
that
it
was
disruptive
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
schoolroom
and
it's
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
no,
i
don't
believe
i
admitted
that
your
honor.
i
think
if
the
situation
broke
down
the
discipline
of
the
school
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
if
i
did,
i
could
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
oh!
they
would
and
the
--
you
assume
the
record
here
that
free
discussion
in
school
with
these
matters
are
permitted.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think
so
long
as
it
doesn't
interrupt
or
disrupt
the
atmosphere
in
the
school.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think
within
the
reason
that's
true.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i'd
go
further
than
that
your
honor.
i
would
say
today
maybe
they
could
the
same
proposition
come
up
if
the
atmosphere
is
different
should
be
permitted.
my
only
claim
here
is
that
what
existed
here,
that
the
school
administration
and
the
school
board
acted
reasonably
and
within
their
discretion,
at
that
time
it
could
be
very
different
today
demonstrations
at
another
time
that
might
not
be
explosive.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
no,
sir.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
no,
i
think
that
that
is
not
correct.
if
i've
given
that
impression
i'm
sorry.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
no,
i
don't
believe
that.
i
believe
the
schools
are
there
to
give
these
children
an
education
and
i
think
des
moines
is
one
of
the
great
spots
in
the
nation
where
they've
done
it.
and
i
feel
that
anything
that
threatens
that
type
of
scholarly
atmosphere
in
the
classroom
ought
to
be
prohibited.
my
time
is
up.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
that's
a
question.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
that's
correct
your
honor.
so,
they
haven't
forbad
it
in
the
schools
but
mathematics
after
all
was
ought
out
to
be
taught
in
a
mathematics
class.
and
i
think
they're
entitled
to
regulate
it.
that's
what
this
is
as
a
regulation.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think
there
was
a
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
--
iron
crosses,
i
think
some
times
they've
worn
political
buttons
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
of
course,
meyer
against
nebraska
is
forbidding
and
teaching
the
german
language,
as
i
recall
it,
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
well,
i
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
surely.
again,
your
honor,
i
have
to
come
back
to
the
situation
that
your
--
that
the
court
really
doesn't
sit
down
in
the
situation
that
the
school
administration
of
the
school
board
does.
they've
got
to
say,
is
this
so
unreasonable
as
to
violate
the
constitutional
right?
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
i
think
we're
getting
very
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
my
opinion
is
that
if
the
court
undertakes
to
go
that
far,
you're
getting
in
to
very
difficult
field
of
trying
to
say
in
every
instance
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
--
whether
a
regulation
is
or
is
not
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
and
i
think
some
things
have
got
to
be
left,
judgment
of
the
administrators.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
that's
correct.
i
say
this
your
honor
i
think
every
case
must
be
reviewed
on
its
own
facts
and
i
think
that's
the
difficulty
in
this
court
getting
into
the
situation.
i'm
trying
to
regulate
it
--
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
allan
a.
herrick
that's
correct
your
honor.
