justice
hugo
l.
black
did
she
claim
that
was
symbolic
speech?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
question
because
you
seem
to
have
admitted
something
--
well,
that
bothers
me.
do
i
understand
that
you
have
admitted
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
forbids
the
people
of
a
state
from
barring
political
discussion
in
that
schools
if
they
want
to
do
so?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
didn't
think
you
intended
to.
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
does
the
person
have
any
more
right
to
have
let
say
make
symbolic
speech
and
he
does
actually
to
talk
and
engaged
in
speech
which
the
first
amendment
protects?
if
not,
why
wouldn't
these
boys
have
a
right
to
demand
that
the
school
let
them
talk
about
vietnam?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
you
claim
is
that
you
have
the
right
to
run
your
school
for
the
teaching
of
geometry,
history,
mathematics
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
grammar
and
the
things
that
people
want
to
teach
and
that
the
federal
constitution
doesn't
step
in
and
tell
you
that
you
got
to
let
anybody
discuss
any
subject
symbolic
or
otherwise
if
they
see
fit.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
he
did
disrupt
it
wouldn't
he
if
he
broke
a
valid
rule?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
you
are
arguinging
then
is
whether
or
not
this
rule
is
valid
of
its
constitutionally
protected?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
do
you
think
that
the
constitution
prevents
the
schools
in
barring
the
discussion
of
particularly
acute
emotional
subjects
such
as
this
is
and
lets
them,
allows
them
to
say
that
we
will
have
nothing
in
here
except
the
teaching
of
the
things
that
the
schools
bar?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
you
wouldn't
say,
mr.
herrick,
that
in
doing
that
they
could
pick
out
one
particular
issue,
public
issue
and
say,
this
you
cannot
do
but
the
rest
you
can
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
--
i
don't
understand
you
to
be
saying
now.
it's
alright
for
them
to
interrupt
your
grammar
classes,
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
your
history
classes,
your
mathematic
classes
and
any
other
classes
that
the
school
is
supposed
to
teach
in
order
to
talk
about
vietnam?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
don't
think
that,
do
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
there
wasn't
any
disruption
here,
was
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
do
you
deny
that
under
the
law
of
iowa
the
school
was
acting
within
the
authority
of
the
state
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
there
any
question
about
that,
do
we
have
to
look
into
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
to
accept
that
it's
being
a
law
of
iowa?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
were
engaged
in
doing
what
the
law
gives
them
the
right
to
do.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
that's
a
valid
rule
it
was
an
explosive
situation
and
a
disruption
was
it
not?
if
it's
a
valid
rule.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
right.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
gets
back
to
that
issue?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
i
must
say
i
agree
to
some
of
the
implication
of
my
brother
fortas
about
that
reasonableness
rule.
i
don't
think
that
case
has
been
cited
approvingly
in
many,
many
years.
and
i
think
the
court
was
very
careful
to
say
this
morning
that
it
wasn't
citing
that
case
to
allow.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
is
it
your
view
that
your
state
of
iowa
is
without
power
if
it
sees
fit,
to
ban
political
discussions
in
the
school
hours
where
children
are
being
taught?
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
now
you
have
the
real
interest
that
the
state
is
trying
to
protect
is
the
right
of
the
state
authorities
and
the
teachers
to
ran
the
schools
and
establish
the
rules
for
teaching
rather
than
the
pupils.
isn't
that
the
interest
it's
trying
to
protect?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
do
you
think
has
the
most
right
about
control
in
the
school,
the
pupils
and
their
policies
and
teaching,
the
pupils
or
the
