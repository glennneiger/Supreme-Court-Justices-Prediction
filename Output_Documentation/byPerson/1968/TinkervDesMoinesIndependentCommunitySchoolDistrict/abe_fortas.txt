justice
abe
fortas
well,
this
is
not
a
religious
establishment
case
here?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
is
there
any
evidence
of
that
in
this
record?
justice
abe
fortas
as
i
understand
i
want
to
be
very
clear
about
this,
in
response
to
my
brother
white's
question.
if
the
record
showed
that
the
wearing
of
the
armbands
significantly
or
substantially
a
material
whatever
is
the
right
word
interfered
with
the
business
of
the
classroom
that
is
communication
between
teachers
and
students,
then
you
would
say
that
disciplinary
action
would
be
justified?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
the
state
passed
a
law
applying
a
ban
on
black
armbands
for
protest
purposes,
across
the
board,
so
that
it
would
be
applied
in
the
private
schools
as
well,
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
abe
fortas
and
your
hope
is
that
these
children
correctly
understood
some
of
our
opinions
on
mootness?
justice
abe
fortas
test
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
ask
you,
does
it
matter
what
the
expression
is
about?
suppose
some
child
shows
up
at
school
wearing
an
outlandish
costume
i
don't
want
to
particularize
it
and
that's
in
violation
of
a
regulation
of
the
schools
saying
a
children
must
come
to
school
to
decently
clothed
and
then
this
child
says
that
i'm
wearing
this
outlandish
costume
because
i
want
to
express
very
strong
belief
and
i
have
in
the
utmost
freedom
for
the
individual
you
know
kool-aid
and
electronic
test
kit
and
all
of
the
things
that
have
been
written
about
these
days.
now,
this
child
says
that's
what
i
want
to
do.
does
that
make
any
difference?
does
he
have
a
constitutionally
protected
right
with
respect
to
that
kind
of
expression
or
would
you
limit
it
to
all
political
matters,
matters
of
social
and
political
importance,
societal
importance
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
as
we,
as
the
older
generation
conceives
it?
justice
abe
fortas
yes
sir,
that's
the
question,
what's
your
opinion
if
you
care
to
express
one?
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
do
with
meyer
against
nebraska
and
bartels
against
iowa?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
so
is
bartels
in
substance.
justice
abe
fortas
those
were
decided
in
1923.
justice
abe
fortas
but
is
that
the
test
you'd
really
say,
that
is
a
court
makes
a
judgment
as
to
whether
or
it's
so
unreasonable,
and
if
it
so
--
if
we
think
it's
so
unreasonable,
by
which
i
suppose
you
mean
excessively
unreasonable
then
we
say
to
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
then
we
tell
the
school
board
what
it
can
and
cannot
do.
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
your
argument,
i'm
asking
for
your
opinion?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
agree
with
you.
justice
abe
fortas
you
would
have
to
agree
with
me
then,
wouldn't
you
that
meyer
and
bartels
present
very
serious
obstacles
because
certainly
those
cases
stand
for
the
proposition
that
denial
of
--
that
a
state
criminal
laws,
state
law
making
in
a
criminal
offense
not
to
teach
german
is
unreasonable
and
that
although
that's
the
state
law
and
state
exercise
of
power
of
a
state
schools,
this
court
declared
that
laws
unconstitutional
of
1923.
