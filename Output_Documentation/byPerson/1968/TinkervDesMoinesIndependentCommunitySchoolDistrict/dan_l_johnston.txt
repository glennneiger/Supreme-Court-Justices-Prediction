mr.
dan
l.
johnston
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
similar
in
some
respects
to
the
decision
and
the
case
of
result
and
decision
in
epperson
versus
arkansas
which
the
court
decided
just
this
morning.
the
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
one
major
distinction
between
epperson
and
this
case
is
that
this
case
involves
the
right
of
public
school
students
other
than
public
school
faculty
members
to
exercise
expressions
of
their
opinions
in
a
non-disruptive
way
in
the
school.
case
began
in
the
united
states
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
no,
it's
not
your
honor.
it's
a
first
amendment
free
speech
case
in
the
sense
of
expression
of
views
rather
than
a
worship
or
establishment
cases.
the
case
began
as
a
petition
for
injunction
and
nominal
damages
under
42
united
states
code
1983
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
iowa.
that
court
dismissed
the
petition
and
on
appeal
to
the
circuit
--
the
decision
was
split
4
to
4.
conduct
of
the
students
essentially
was
this,
that
christmas
time
in
1965
they
decided
that
they
would
wear
small
black
armbands
to
express
certain
views
which
they
had
in
regard
to
the
war
in
vietnam.
specifically,
the
views
were
that
they
mourn
the
dead
of
both
sides,
both
civilian
and
military
in
that
war
and
they
supported
the
proposal
that
have
made
by
united
states
senator
robert
kennedy
that
the
truce
which
had
been
proposed
for
that
war
over
the
christmas
period
be
made
an
open
ended
or
an
indefinite
truce.
this
was
the
purpose
that
the
students
gave
for
wearing
the
armbands
during
this
period.
during
the
period
of
time
of
course,
there
were
school
days
and
they
wore
the
armbands
to
school.
prior
to
the
time
when
any
of
these
petitioners
wore
the
armbands
to
school,
it
came
to
the
attention
of
the
school
authorities
that
perhaps
there
would
be
some
students
who
would
express
views
related
to
the
war
in
vietnam
in
this
manner
during
school
time.
the
principles
of
the
secondary
schools,
the
high
schools
and
perhaps
the
junior
high
schools
in
the
city
of
des
moines,
a
public
school
system
met
prior
to
the
time
in
any
of
the
armbands
have
been
worn
and
enacted
policy
which
was
not
written
but
which
was
agreed
upon
among
themselves
that
no
student
could
wear
an
armband
in
the
des
moines
public
school
system
for
this
purpose
that
if
a
student
came
to
school
wearing
the
armband
he
would
be
asked
to
remove
it.
failing
that,
the
student's
parents
would
be
contacted
and
their
assistance
would
be
solicited
in
getting
the
students
to
remove
the
armbands.
failing
that,
the
students
would
be
set
home
would
be
in
effect
suspended
from
school
until
such
time
as
they
were
willing
to
return
to
school
without
the
armbands.
the
three
students
who
are
petitioner
in
this
case,
christopher
eckhardt
who
was
16
and
in
the
10th
grade
of
roosevelt
high
school
in
des
moines
at
the
time,
john
tinker
who
was
15
and
in
the
11th
grade
at
another
high
school,
mary
beth
tinker
who
was
13
and
in
the
8th
grade
determined
that
in
spite
of
the
policy
that
have
been
announced
to
the
schools
that
they
would
wear
the
armbands
as
a
matter
of
conscience
to
express
the
views
that
they
have.
christopher
eckhardt
and
mary
beth
tinker
wore
theirs
on
the
first
day.
mr.
eckhardt
went
to
school
have
the
armband
on
but
knowing
of
the
policy
against
the
wearing
of
the
armbands
because
as
i
say
it's
been
announced.
he
went
quite
immediately
to
the
office
of
the
principal
and
said,
“i'm
wearing
the
armband,
i
know
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
school
policy.”
the
principal
carried
out
the
dictates
of
the
policy
which
were
to
tell
the
student
to
remove
it.
the
student
said,
he
could
not
in
good
conscience
remove
the
armband
but
he
thought
he
had
a
right
to
wear.
the
student's
mother
was
called
and
she
supported
her
son
in
the
activity
and
then
young
mr.
eckhardt
was
suspended
from
school.
he
was
out
of
school
approximately
six
days
or
five
days
prior
to
the
christmas
vacation
and
then
one
day
after
the
christmas
vacation.
mary
beth
tinker
also
wore
her
armband
on
that
first
day.
however,
she
wore
it
throughout
the
entire
morning
without
any
incident
related
to
it
and
any
way
disrupted
the
school
or
distracted.
she
wore
it
at
lunch
and
she
wore
it
where
there
was
by
the
way
some
conversation
between
herself
and
other
students
in
the
lunch
room
about
why
she
was
wearing
the
armband
and
whether
or
not
she
should
be
wearing
it.
and
then
wore
it
into
the
first
class
in
the
afternoon
and
it
was
in
the
first
class
in
the
afternoon
that
she
was
called
to
the
office
and
the
procedure
was
followed
for
contacting
her
parents
apparently
asking
her
to
remove
it
and
she
did
remove
the
armband
and
then
returned
to
class.
however,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
had
removed
the
armband
and
returned
and
was
returned
to
class,
she
was
later
called
out
of
class
and
suspended
nevertheless.
john
tinker
determined
that
it
was
his
belief
that
the
armband
should
not
be
worn
in
open
violation
of
the
policy
that
the
schools
had
adopted
until
some
attempts
have
been
made
to
try
to
reach
an
accommodation
with
the
school
board.
so,
on
the
first
day,
john
tinker
did
not
wear
the
armbands
to
school
rather
in
the
evening
of
the
day
when
mr.
eckhardt
and
john's
sister
mary
beth
were
suspended
from
school,
he
with
some
other
students
who
had
worn
the
armbands
attempted
to
contact
the
superintendent
of
the
--
not
superintendent,
excuse
me,
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
school
at
the
morning
of
public
schools
and
they
requested
that
he
calls
special
meeting
of
the
board
of
directors,
the
school
board
as
we
call
it
for
the
purpose
of
tying
to
reach
an
accommodation
between
the
students,
the
desire
of
the
students
and
the
policy
enacted
by
the
principals
of
the
school.
they
were
refused
this
special
meeting
of
the
school
board
and
then
on
the
next
day,
friday,
john
tinker
wore
his
armband
to
school,
wore
throughout
the
morning
hours
without
any
untoward
incident,
without
any
substantial
or
material
disruption
to
the
school.
he
wore
at
lunch
where
there
was
again
some
discussion
about
it
in
a
period
it's
generally
free
and
open
for
discussion
among
students.
and
then
wore
into
the
first
class
in
the
afternoon
where
he
was
suspended.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
think
in
that
case
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
yes.
in
that
case
your
honor,
we
would
not
be
here
even
if
he
insisted
in
doing
it
only
for
a
second
because
he
would
clearly
be
--
although
he
would
be
expressing
his
views,
he
would
be
doing
something
else.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
to
express
the
message,
yes.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
to
every
one
in
the
class,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
to
the
extent
that
they
would
see
it
but
i
don't
believe
there
was
any
--
i
don't
believe
that
the
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
they
were
intended
to
see
it
in
a
way
they
would
not
be
destructed.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
and
to
understand
it
yes
your
honor.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
and
to
absorb
the
message.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
except
that
your
honor
i
believe
that
the
method
of
the
students
chose
in
this
particular
instance
was
specifically
designed
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
not
cause
that
kind
of
disruption.
none
of
the
teachers
who
testified
at
the
hearing
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
they
were
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
no,
they
intended
it
to
be
in
effective
but
at
the
same
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
there
would
be
no
reason
to
take
it
off
when
walking
in
a
class.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
it
was
not
disruptive
in
the
class
your
honor.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
there's
no
testimony
by
any
of
the
teachers
that
there
was
in
any
way
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
--
destructive
or
disruptive.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
they
wore
the
armband
to
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
convey
the
message,
that's
right.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
think
it's
as
fair
in
assumption
that
the
method
of
expression
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
think
they
intended,
i
think
they
chose
the
message,
chose
the
method
of
expression
your
honor
which
would
not
be
disruptive,
destructive
when
they
are
in
the
class.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
think
perhaps
your
honor,
it
might
for
a
few
moments
have
done
that
and
i
think
it
perhaps
might
have
distracted
some
students
just
as
many
other
things
do
in
the
classroom
which
are
allowed
from
time
to
time.
i
think
it
might
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
but
which
the
school
also
allows
to
continue.
i
don't
think
there's
any
suggestion
that
the
school
attempts
to
regulate
all
sorts
of
things
that
might
be
distractive
especially
in
a
sense
of
these
--
of
this
type
of
activity
which
probably
contribute
something
to
the
total
atmosphere
in
the
school
for
them
to
stress.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
it's
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
that's
right.
it
prohibits
them
from
wearing
the
armbands
at
gym
class,
in
the
cafeteria,
in
the
halls
at
any
time
in
school.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
our
contention
is
that
the
policy
as
it
was
adopted,
that
was
a
broad
policy
we
do
not
distinguish
not
in
any
way
was
directed
toward
disruption
or
destruction
is
a
policy
which
will
not
stand
the
test
of
freedom
of
expression
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
number
of
political
buttons
were
warned
at
this
school.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i'm
for
humphrey,
i'm
for
--
well,
we
didn't
it
at
that
time.
i'm
for
humphrey,
i'm
for
nixon,
i'm
for
goldwater.
the
record
also
shows
that
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
don't
believe
that,
that
to
me
would
not
be
the
sort
of
thing
which
would
be
designed
to
disrupt
the
class.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
the
situation
i
think
and
the
problem
we
have
is
this
specific
regulation
directed
only
toward
one
specific
kind
of
conduct.
now,
there
is
in
the
record,
document
called
at
which
was
defendant's
exhibit
3
in
the
trial
which
is
a
broad
statement
of
policy
by
the
school
are
related
to
things
that
disrupt,
related
to
disrupting
conduct.
the
difficulty
we
have
with
this
particular
policy
as
it
was
enacted
is
that
there
was
no
indication,
no
testimony
by
teachers,
by
administrators
or
any
one
else
of
any
reason
to
believe
that
it
would
be
disruptive.
and
when
the
students
in
fact
did
wear
the
armbands,
the
record
quite
clearly
shows
that
it
was
not
in
fact
disruptive.
that
the
--
and
i
believe
it's
interesting
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
believe
it
would
be
more
easily
sustainable
or
directed
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
no,
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
it
would
not
be.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
don't
have
to
take
that
position
in
this
case.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
do
in
answer
to
the
court's
question
because
i
have
to
be
candid
with
the
court
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
because
the
armband
regulation
in
this
case
was
directed
toward
wearing
of
the
armband
in
any
time
in
the
school
whether
or
not
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
--
disruptive.
they
did
wear
it
in
class.
there's
no
indication
that
they
were
suspended
just
for
wearing
it
for
class.
for
instance,
christopher
eckhardt
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
because
that
the
question
i
believe
i
would
suggest
it's
before
us
is
the
question
of
a
policy
that
was
adopted
whether
or
not
the
policy
itself
will
stand
a
test
of
freedom
of
expression
under
the
first
amendment.
christopher
eckhardt,
by
the
way,
as
i've
indicated
never
did
wear
the
armband
to
class
and
yet
was
suspended.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
the
action
that
was
brought
was
for
an
injunction,
for
injunctive
relief
and
for
nominal
damages
under
the
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
against
any
enforcement
of
the
regulation
which
would
infringe
upon
the
student's
freedom
of
expression.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
unless
they
were
kept
out
of
there
for
the
express
purpose
of
preventing
disruption,
unless
there
was
some
showing
that
they
would
cause
disruption.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
yes.
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i'm
trying
--
yes.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
on
the
state
of
this
record.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
the
suggestion,
i
believe
we're
making
your
honor
is
that
there
should
not
be
any
special
rule
for
freedom
of
expression
cases
for
schools.
now,
that
would
mean
that
the
general
terminiello
the
type
of
response
that
the
state
first
has
an
obligation
to
try
to
move
directly
against
the
--
those
causing
the
disruption
rather
than
to
take
away
the
first
amendment
right
to
free
expression
would
apply
also.
but
again,
we
don't
reach
that
in
this
case
because
there
are
just
simply
is
not
that
kind
of
evidence
in
the
record.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
or
as
the
fifth
circuit
in
two
cases,
burnside
versus
byars
seems
to
indicate
and
blackhall
versus
isoqueena,
byars
case
cited
in
our
brief,
a
material
and
substantial
disruption
to
the
schools
would
justify
perhaps
the
subordination
of
freedom
of
expression.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
the
facts
of
the
terminiello
case
are
not
necessary
applicable
to
the
classroom
with
the
kind
of
test
and
the
thing,
your
honor,
that
we've
been
trying
to
do
with
in
this
case
since
the
trial
was
is
the
concept
that
wholly
special
rules
--
wholly
special
doctrines
for
some
reason
should
be
applied
to
the
first
amendment
law
in
schools.
what
we
suggest
and
we
admit
and
we've
admitted
from
the
beginning
that
the
amount
of
disruption
that's
permissible
in
a
public
hall
in
chicago
or
in
a
street
in
new
york
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
anything
that
prevents
the
state
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
no,
certainly
not.
you're
talking
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
there
isn't
any
doubt
about
that
in
our
mind,
your
honor.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
this
might
have
been
impaired
the
ability
of
the
school
to
carry
out
the
purposes
that
it
was
there
for.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
your
honor,
there's
none.
as
i
say
there
was
a
discussion
from
time
to
time
at
the
cafeteria
at
lunch.
there
was
some
discussion
in
the
halls,
there
is
and
i'm
frank
to
say
when
john
tinker
wore
the
armband
in
the
first
hour
they
were
engaged
in
the
class
which
was
a
free
discussion
type
of
class.
the
instructor
of
the
class
was
outside
the
room
and
he
was
asked
during
that
period
about
the
armband
and
he
did
explain
to
the
students
why
he
wore
it.
we
are
urging
upon
the
court
the
concept
that
especially
in
the
public
schools
which
is
this
court
recognized
this
morning
in
arkansas
case
as
it
is
recognized
many
times
before
that
it's
important
that
the
idea
of
freedom
of
dissent
and
inquiry
and
expression
be
maintained
in
the
schools
and
that
there
are
certainly
is
nothing
in
this
record
which
indicates
that
the
sufficient
amount
--
sufficient
quantum
of
evidence
to
overcome
that
presumption.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
think
we
can
take
that
position.
i
would
like
to
make
a
distinction,
if
i
may,
between
the
--
an
expression
of
an
opinion
which
might
itself
disrupt
the
class
and
the
expression
of
an
opinion
which
might
cause
someone
else
to
disrupt
the
class.
and
i
believe
those
are
perhaps
two
separate
cases.
i
also
like
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
expression
of
an
opinion
which
is
coupled
with
something
else,
like
marching
in
the
hallway
or
standing
up
in
the
class
and
making
a
speech
about
the
war
in
vietnam
during
mathematics
class.
that
kind
of
thing,
i
think
the
court
can
prohibit,
but
we
are
in
a
situation
here
where
the
record
just
simply
doesn't
support
that
kind
of
a
situation.
rather
it
supports
the
idea
that
before
anyone
wore
armband
really
on
the
basis
of
pure
conjecture
that
the
policy
was
adopted
frankly
for
the
purpose
and
the
administrators
and
the
teachers
say
this
over
and
over
again,
it
was
the
principle
of
the
demonstration,
the
idea
of
expressing
political
beliefs
that
they
were
opposed
to
in
this
context.
and
that
the
students
were
suspended
for
violating
that
policy
and
not
suspended
for
causing
any
disruption
in
the
classroom.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
think
that
would
probably
your
honor
interfere
with
some
earlier
decisions
of
this
court
probably
in
regard
to
the
right
of
individuals
of
citizens
to
establish
private
schools
and
so
long
as
they
meet
the
accreditation
standards
to
educate
their
children
as
they
see
fit.
i
believe
that's
probably
a
different
kind
of
situation
from
what
we
have
here.
the
situation
here,
as
i
view
it,
is
based
not
so
much
upon
the
conduct
of
the
students,
whether
or
not
it
was
permissible
but
the
conduct
of
the
state
whether
or
not
the
conduct
of
the
state
was
permissible.
whether
or
not
where
we
have
a
situation
of
pure
expression
and
nothing
else
which
was
no
evidence
of
any
material
or
substantial
disruption
of
any
public
interest,
whether
or
not
in
that
situation
the
state
can
move
to
subordinate
and
to
punish
freedom
of
expression.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
the
case
is
not
moot
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
your
honor
the
students
each
testified
in
the
district
court,
and
this
will
appear
in
the
record,
that
although
they
did
return
to
school
because
of
the
obvious
dire
consequences
to
themselves
if
they
do
not
return
to
school,
that
they
still
have
these
views
in
the
war
in
vietnam.
they
still
have
the
desire
to
wear
armbands
to
express
their
opposition
to
the
war
in
vietnam
and,
where
the
policy
taken
away.
they
would
wear
their
armbands
to
school.
that
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
it's
in
the
appendix
your
honor,
that
testimony
in
the
record.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
yes,
it
is
in
the
complaint.
yes,
it
was
alleged
in
the
complaint.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
the
--
and
in
any
event
because
we
anticipated
the
possibility
that
by
the
time
the
case
might
be
finally
decided.
the
students
might
no
longer
be
in
school
and
might
no
longer
have
that
interest.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
that's
right,
we
did
your
honor.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
that's
what
i
was
getting
to.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
not
your
honor
in
a
case
that
goes
up
under
the
--
under
42
united
states
code
1983
rather
than
under
diversity.
statute
itself
does
not
name
any
particular
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
yes,
your
honor
it
is.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i've
also
--
well,
yes.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
your
honor
we'll
hope
for
that
of
course.
i
would
say
that
the
prayer
for
damages
is
still
there.
the
students
were
still
out
of
school
for
six
days
in
the
instance
of
two,
five
days
in
the
instance
of
one.
i
would
also
say
to
the
court
to
speaking
very
frankly
that
my
own
experience
and
i'm
sure
the
court's
experience
is
that
this
is
not
an
isolated
problem,
that
the
correct
balance
between
the
interest
of
the
school
in
maintaining
discipline
and
decorum
and
the
rights
of
the
students
who,
because
i
believe
of
the
improvement
in
american
education,
have
increasingly
moved
to
have
opinions
and
to
want
to
express
opinions,
that
this
kind
of
situation
arises
and
will
continue
to
arise.
and
we
suggest
that
this
case
provides
a
good
context
for
the
court
provide
guidance
for
the
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
your
honor,
i
really
would
not
think
it
would
get
you
any
further
in
that
sort
of
thing
then
in
barnette
versus
board
of
education
of
west
virginia
than
did
the
case
that
the
court
announced
this
morning.
they
did
a
number
of
other
cases
where
the
court
has
held
that
whatever
are
the
delicate
functions
of
school
boards
and
there
are
certainly
delicate,
especially
these
days,
that
they
still
have
no
function
which
cannot
be
exercised
within
the
purview
and
within
the
dictates
of
this
court's
decision
under
the
first
amendment.
and
that's
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
understand.
those
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
mr.
justice
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
believe
that
the
real
question
in
that
regard
hinges
upon
whether
or
not
the
utterance
is
expression,
as
contemplated
by
the
first
amendment
which
was
a
finding
that
the
district
court
made,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
students
were
engaged
and
the
expression
of
views
privileged
by
the
first
amendment
unless
it's
subordinated
by
some
other
state
interest.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
my
opinion
would
be,
in
that
instance,
that
probably,
again
it
would
depend
a
lot
upon
what
the
students
said
and
demeanor
of
the
student
when
he
expressed
the
things
of
that
sort
that
that
probably
would
not
be
within
the
purview
of
the
first
amendment,
but
again
it's
just
conjecture
on
my
part.
certainly
just
to
wear
one's
haircut
the
way
wants
one,
and
way
wants
to
may
present
fourteenth
amendment
problems,
as
arbitrariness
and
things
of
that
sort.
but
it
does
not
present
per
se
first
amendment
problems
such
as
we
have
here.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
never
was
made.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
no,
they
did
not
your
honor.
they
--
by
the
time
they
got
finally
to
the
board,
they
felt
the
necessity
i
believe
to
sustain
the
action
of
their
principles.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
this
was
the,
generally,
the
public
schools
is
des
moines.
three
schools
involved.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
the
--
mr.
eckhardt
was
in
the
10th
grade
your
honor
at
roosevelt
high
school.
mr.
tinker
was
in
the
11th
grade
at
north
high
school,
and
mary
beth
tinker
was
in
the
13th
grade
at
warren
harding
junior
high
school.
no,
excuse
me
the
8th
grade
at
warren
harding
junior
high
school.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
to
the
extent,
your
honor
that
those
people
have
views
and
can
express
them
within
the
purview
of
the
first
amendment
it
would,
yes.
i
should
not
think
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
special
rule
for
schools
or
any
other
par
of
our
society
for
the
first
amendment.
now,
the
evidence
of
disruption
might
be
different
but
as
far
as
the
principles
apply,
we'd
like
to
have
the
same
principles
applied
in
the
school
or
perhaps
especially
in
the
school
that
are
applied
elsewhere.
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
argument
for
rebuttal.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
thank
you
your
honor.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out,
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice,
one
of
the
things
which
i
believe
it's
been
mentioned
but
needs
to
be
mentioned
more
firmly
and
that
was
that
there
was
in
the
school
no
general
prohibition
against
political
emblems
of
this
nature.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
the
school
was
acting,
your
honor,
under
a
very
broad
state
statute
which
gives
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
no,
your
honor.
the
question
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
yes,
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
it
gives
them
the
power
to
do,
yes
your
honor.
but
i,
the
point
i'm
--
i'd
like
to
impress
upon
the
court
this
time
is
on
pages
44
and
50
and
51
of
the
record.
it's
very
amply
stated
by
respondents
that
other
kinds
of
political
insignia
including
the
iron
cross
were
worn
in
the
schools
that
they
were
not
covered
by
this
policy,
that
there
was
no
policy
covering
them,
that
it
was
simply
this
one
policy
against
the
wearing
of
the
armbands
in
this
context.
now,
counsel
indicates
that
there
was
some
sort
of
explosive
situation
which
made
this
as
a
special
circumstance.
i
can't
of
course
recite
to
the
record
to
prove
a
negative.
i
can
just
simply
say
that
i
don't
believe
that
the
record
supports
that
kind
of
a
situation.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
yes,
your
honor
it
is
but
our
point
is
that
the
rule
is
not
valid.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
because
it's
based
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
--
and
because
it's
based
solely
upon
a
fourteenth
amendment
alone
type
stand
of
reasonableness.
and
this
court
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
for
instance
in
the
case
of
--
in
the
barnette
case
which
we've
cited
in
the
brief
which
was
the
case
of
the
compulsory
flag
salute.
this
court
specifically
said
that
mere
fourteenth
amendment
test
of
reasonableness
are
not
sufficient
in
the
schools
when
the
students
are
engaged
in
something
or
where
the
conduct
involves
something
that's
privilege
under
the
first
amendment.
that's
the
suggestion
we
have
here.
now,
the
reasons
for
the
school
board
establishing
the
regulation
are
set
out
in
page
70
of
the
record
at
quite
some
length
by
a
document
promulgated
by
the
school
board
itself.
counsel
referred
to
them,
those
reasons
which
were
by
the
way
passed
or
at
least
reduced
the
paper
after
the
suspensions
in
a
week
after
the
suspensions.
simply
to
my
reading
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
do
not
provide
sufficient
grounds
for
the
subordination
of
freedom
of
expression.
now,
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
it
would
not
--
it
has
that
power.
i
believe
it
has
the
power
but
it's
not
necessary
in
this
case
because
that's
not
what
they've
done,
your
honor.
they've
banned
only
the
discussion
in
one
specific
instance
and
that's
all
there
is.
now,
i
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
in
addition
to
the
other
argument
that
i
want
to
make
and
that
is
--
and
i
believe
the
stronger
argument
is
not
the
equal
protection
argument,
not
the
censorship
by
discrimination
argument
mr.
justice
black
has
called
it.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
stronger
argument
is
that
the
interest
of
the
state
sought
to
protect
whatever
that
may
have
been
it's
set
out
on
page
70
of
the
record
simply
was
not
sufficient
where
as
it
might
have
been
sufficient
to
justify
the
suppression
of
something
it
was
privileged
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
your
honor,
i
don't
read
that
from
the
record.
i
believe
that
--
i
believe
in
the
record
to
what
the
school
wants.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
the
authorities
that
are
running
the
schools
under
the
authority
given
by
them
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
within
the
provisions
of
that
constitution.
and
the
whole
number
of
our
case
is
that
they
of
course
that
they've
exceeded
their
powers
under
that.
thank
you.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
similar
in
some
respects
to
the
decision
and
the
case
of
result
and
decision
in
epperson
versus
arkansas
which
the
court
decided
just
this
morning.
the
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
circuit
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
one
major
distinction
between
epperson
and
this
case
is
that
this
case
involves
the
right
of
public
school
students
other
than
public
school
faculty
members
to
exercise
expressions
of
their
opinions
in
a
non-disruptive
way
in
the
school.
case
began
in
the
united
states
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
no,
it's
not
your
honor.
it's
a
first
amendment
free
speech
case
in
the
sense
of
expression
of
views
rather
than
a
worship
or
establishment
cases.
the
case
began
as
a
petition
for
injunction
and
nominal
damages
under
42
united
states
code
1983
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
iowa.
that
court
dismissed
the
petition
and
on
appeal
to
the
circuit
--
the
decision
was
split
4
to
4.
conduct
of
the
students
essentially
was
this,
that
christmas
time
in
1965
they
decided
that
they
would
wear
small
black
armbands
to
express
certain
views
which
they
had
in
regard
to
the
war
in
vietnam.
specifically,
the
views
were
that
they
mourn
the
dead
of
both
sides,
both
civilian
and
military
in
that
war
and
they
supported
the
proposal
that
have
made
by
united
states
senator
robert
kennedy
that
the
truce
which
had
been
proposed
for
that
war
over
the
christmas
period
be
made
an
open
ended
or
an
indefinite
truce.
this
was
the
purpose
that
the
students
gave
for
wearing
the
armbands
during
this
period.
during
the
period
of
time
of
course,
there
were
school
days
and
they
wore
the
armbands
to
school.
prior
to
the
time
when
any
of
these
petitioners
wore
the
armbands
to
school,
it
came
to
the
attention
of
the
school
authorities
that
perhaps
there
would
be
some
students
who
would
express
views
related
to
the
war
in
vietnam
in
this
manner
during
school
time.
the
principles
of
the
secondary
schools,
the
high
schools
and
perhaps
the
junior
high
schools
in
the
city
of
des
moines,
a
public
school
system
met
prior
to
the
time
in
any
of
the
armbands
have
been
worn
and
enacted
policy
which
was
not
written
but
which
was
agreed
upon
among
themselves
that
no
student
could
wear
an
armband
in
the
des
moines
public
school
system
for
this
purpose
that
if
a
student
came
to
school
wearing
the
armband
he
would
be
asked
to
remove
it.
failing
that,
the
student's
parents
would
be
contacted
and
their
assistance
would
be
solicited
in
getting
the
students
to
remove
the
armbands.
failing
that,
the
students
would
be
set
home
would
be
in
effect
suspended
from
school
until
such
time
as
they
were
willing
to
return
to
school
without
the
armbands.
the
three
students
who
are
petitioner
in
this
case,
christopher
eckhardt
who
was
16
and
in
the
10th
grade
of
roosevelt
high
school
in
des
moines
at
the
time,
john
tinker
who
was
15
and
in
the
11th
grade
at
another
high
school,
mary
beth
tinker
who
was
13
and
in
the
8th
grade
determined
that
in
spite
of
the
policy
that
have
been
announced
to
the
schools
that
they
would
wear
the
armbands
as
a
matter
of
conscience
to
express
the
views
that
they
have.
christopher
eckhardt
and
mary
beth
tinker
wore
theirs
on
the
first
day.
mr.
eckhardt
went
to
school
have
the
armband
on
but
knowing
of
the
policy
against
the
wearing
of
the
armbands
because
as
i
say
it's
been
announced.
he
went
quite
immediately
to
the
office
of
the
principal
and
said,
“i'm
wearing
the
armband,
i
know
that
it
is
a
violation
of
the
school
policy.”
the
principal
carried
out
the
dictates
of
the
policy
which
were
to
tell
the
student
to
remove
it.
the
student
said,
he
could
not
in
good
conscience
remove
the
armband
but
he
thought
he
had
a
right
to
wear.
the
student's
mother
was
called
and
she
supported
her
son
in
the
activity
and
then
young
mr.
eckhardt
was
suspended
from
school.
he
was
out
of
school
approximately
six
days
or
five
days
prior
to
the
christmas
vacation
and
then
one
day
after
the
christmas
vacation.
mary
beth
tinker
also
wore
her
armband
on
that
first
day.
however,
she
wore
it
throughout
the
entire
morning
without
any
incident
related
to
it
and
any
way
disrupted
the
school
or
distracted.
she
wore
it
at
lunch
and
she
wore
it
where
there
was
by
the
way
some
conversation
between
herself
and
other
students
in
the
lunch
room
about
why
she
was
wearing
the
armband
and
whether
or
not
she
should
be
wearing
it.
and
then
wore
it
into
the
first
class
in
the
afternoon
and
it
was
in
the
first
class
in
the
afternoon
that
she
was
called
to
the
office
and
the
procedure
was
followed
for
contacting
her
parents
apparently
asking
her
to
remove
it
and
she
did
remove
the
armband
and
then
returned
to
class.
however,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
had
removed
the
armband
and
returned
and
was
returned
to
class,
she
was
later
called
out
of
class
and
suspended
nevertheless.
john
tinker
determined
that
it
was
his
belief
that
the
armband
should
not
be
worn
in
open
violation
of
the
policy
that
the
schools
had
adopted
until
some
attempts
have
been
made
to
try
to
reach
an
accommodation
with
the
school
board.
so,
on
the
first
day,
john
tinker
did
not
wear
the
armbands
to
school
rather
in
the
evening
of
the
day
when
mr.
eckhardt
and
john's
sister
mary
beth
were
suspended
from
school,
he
with
some
other
students
who
had
worn
the
armbands
attempted
to
contact
the
superintendent
of
the
--
not
superintendent,
excuse
me,
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
school
at
the
morning
of
public
schools
and
they
requested
that
he
calls
special
meeting
of
the
board
of
directors,
the
school
board
as
we
call
it
for
the
purpose
of
tying
to
reach
an
accommodation
between
the
students,
the
desire
of
the
students
and
the
policy
enacted
by
the
principals
of
the
school.
they
were
refused
this
special
meeting
of
the
school
board
and
then
on
the
next
day,
friday,
john
tinker
wore
his
armband
to
school,
wore
throughout
the
morning
hours
without
any
untoward
incident,
without
any
substantial
or
material
disruption
to
the
school.
he
wore
at
lunch
where
there
was
again
some
discussion
about
it
in
a
period
it's
generally
free
and
open
for
discussion
among
students.
and
then
wore
into
the
first
class
in
the
afternoon
where
he
was
suspended.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
think
in
that
case
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
yes.
in
that
case
your
honor,
we
would
not
be
here
even
if
he
insisted
in
doing
it
only
for
a
second
because
he
would
clearly
be
--
although
he
would
be
expressing
his
views,
he
would
be
doing
something
else.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
to
express
the
message,
yes.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
to
every
one
in
the
class,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
to
the
extent
that
they
would
see
it
but
i
don't
believe
there
was
any
--
i
don't
believe
that
the
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
they
were
intended
to
see
it
in
a
way
they
would
not
be
destructed.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
and
to
understand
it
yes
your
honor.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
and
to
absorb
the
message.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
except
that
your
honor
i
believe
that
the
method
of
the
students
chose
in
this
particular
instance
was
specifically
designed
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
not
cause
that
kind
of
disruption.
none
of
the
teachers
who
testified
at
the
hearing
in
the
district
court
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
no,
your
honor.
i
believe
they
were
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
no,
they
intended
it
to
be
in
effective
but
at
the
same
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
there
would
be
no
reason
to
take
it
off
when
walking
in
a
class.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
it
was
not
disruptive
in
the
class
your
honor.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
there's
no
testimony
by
any
of
the
teachers
that
there
was
in
any
way
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
--
destructive
or
disruptive.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
they
wore
the
armband
to
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
convey
the
message,
that's
right.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
think
it's
as
fair
in
assumption
that
the
method
of
expression
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
think
they
intended,
i
think
they
chose
the
message,
chose
the
method
of
expression
your
honor
which
would
not
be
disruptive,
destructive
when
they
are
in
the
class.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
think
perhaps
your
honor,
it
might
for
a
few
moments
have
done
that
and
i
think
it
perhaps
might
have
distracted
some
students
just
as
many
other
things
do
in
the
classroom
which
are
allowed
from
time
to
time.
i
think
it
might
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
but
which
the
school
also
allows
to
continue.
i
don't
think
there's
any
suggestion
that
the
school
attempts
to
regulate
all
sorts
of
things
that
might
be
distractive
especially
in
a
sense
of
these
--
of
this
type
of
activity
which
probably
contribute
something
to
the
total
atmosphere
in
the
school
for
them
to
stress.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
that's
correct,
that's
correct.
it's
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
that's
right.
it
prohibits
them
from
wearing
the
armbands
at
gym
class,
in
the
cafeteria,
in
the
halls
at
any
time
in
school.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
that's
correct.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
our
contention
is
that
the
policy
as
it
was
adopted,
that
was
a
broad
policy
we
do
not
distinguish
not
in
any
way
was
directed
toward
disruption
or
destruction
is
a
policy
which
will
not
stand
the
test
of
freedom
of
expression
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
number
of
political
buttons
were
warned
at
this
school.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i'm
for
humphrey,
i'm
for
--
well,
we
didn't
it
at
that
time.
i'm
for
humphrey,
i'm
for
nixon,
i'm
for
goldwater.
the
record
also
shows
that
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
don't
believe
that,
that
to
me
would
not
be
the
sort
of
thing
which
would
be
designed
to
disrupt
the
class.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
the
situation
i
think
and
the
problem
we
have
is
this
specific
regulation
directed
only
toward
one
specific
kind
of
conduct.
now,
there
is
in
the
record,
document
called
at
which
was
defendant's
exhibit
3
in
the
trial
which
is
a
broad
statement
of
policy
by
the
school
are
related
to
things
that
disrupt,
related
to
disrupting
conduct.
the
difficulty
we
have
with
this
particular
policy
as
it
was
enacted
is
that
there
was
no
indication,
no
testimony
by
teachers,
by
administrators
or
any
one
else
of
any
reason
to
believe
that
it
would
be
disruptive.
and
when
the
students
in
fact
did
wear
the
armbands,
the
record
quite
clearly
shows
that
it
was
not
in
fact
disruptive.
that
the
--
and
i
believe
it's
interesting
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
believe
it
would
be
more
easily
sustainable
or
directed
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
no,
i
don't
believe
so
your
honor.
it
would
not
be.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
don't
have
to
take
that
position
in
this
case.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
do
in
answer
to
the
court's
question
because
i
have
to
be
candid
with
the
court
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
because
the
armband
regulation
in
this
case
was
directed
toward
wearing
of
the
armband
in
any
time
in
the
school
whether
or
not
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
--
disruptive.
they
did
wear
it
in
class.
there's
no
indication
that
they
were
suspended
just
for
wearing
it
for
class.
for
instance,
christopher
eckhardt
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
because
that
the
question
i
believe
i
would
suggest
it's
before
us
is
the
question
of
a
policy
that
was
adopted
whether
or
not
the
policy
itself
will
stand
a
test
of
freedom
of
expression
under
the
first
amendment.
christopher
eckhardt,
by
the
way,
as
i've
indicated
never
did
wear
the
armband
to
class
and
yet
was
suspended.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
the
action
that
was
brought
was
for
an
injunction,
for
injunctive
relief
and
for
nominal
damages
under
the
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
against
any
enforcement
of
the
regulation
which
would
infringe
upon
the
student's
freedom
of
expression.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
unless
they
were
kept
out
of
there
for
the
express
purpose
of
preventing
disruption,
unless
there
was
some
showing
that
they
would
cause
disruption.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
yes.
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i'm
trying
--
yes.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
on
the
state
of
this
record.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
the
suggestion,
i
believe
we're
making
your
honor
is
that
there
should
not
be
any
special
rule
for
freedom
of
expression
cases
for
schools.
now,
that
would
mean
that
the
general
terminiello
the
type
of
response
that
the
state
first
has
an
obligation
to
try
to
move
directly
against
the
--
those
causing
the
disruption
rather
than
to
take
away
the
first
amendment
right
to
free
expression
would
apply
also.
but
again,
we
don't
reach
that
in
this
case
because
there
are
just
simply
is
not
that
kind
of
evidence
in
the
record.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
or
as
the
fifth
circuit
in
two
cases,
burnside
versus
byars
seems
to
indicate
and
blackhall
versus
isoqueena,
byars
case
cited
in
our
brief,
a
material
and
substantial
disruption
to
the
schools
would
justify
perhaps
the
subordination
of
freedom
of
expression.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
the
facts
of
the
terminiello
case
are
not
necessary
applicable
to
the
classroom
with
the
kind
of
test
and
the
thing,
your
honor,
that
we've
been
trying
to
do
with
in
this
case
since
the
trial
was
is
the
concept
that
wholly
special
rules
--
wholly
special
doctrines
for
some
reason
should
be
applied
to
the
first
amendment
law
in
schools.
what
we
suggest
and
we
admit
and
we've
admitted
from
the
beginning
that
the
amount
of
disruption
that's
permissible
in
a
public
hall
in
chicago
or
in
a
street
in
new
york
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
anything
that
prevents
the
state
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
no,
certainly
not.
you're
talking
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
there
isn't
any
doubt
about
that
in
our
mind,
your
honor.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
this
might
have
been
impaired
the
ability
of
the
school
to
carry
out
the
purposes
that
it
was
there
for.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
your
honor,
there's
none.
as
i
say
there
was
a
discussion
from
time
to
time
at
the
cafeteria
at
lunch.
there
was
some
discussion
in
the
halls,
there
is
and
i'm
frank
to
say
when
john
tinker
wore
the
armband
in
the
first
hour
they
were
engaged
in
the
class
which
was
a
free
discussion
type
of
class.
the
instructor
of
the
class
was
outside
the
room
and
he
was
asked
during
that
period
about
the
armband
and
he
did
explain
to
the
students
why
he
wore
it.
we
are
urging
upon
the
court
the
concept
that
especially
in
the
public
schools
which
is
this
court
recognized
this
morning
in
arkansas
case
as
it
is
recognized
many
times
before
that
it's
important
that
the
idea
of
freedom
of
dissent
and
inquiry
and
expression
be
maintained
in
the
schools
and
that
there
are
certainly
is
nothing
in
this
record
which
indicates
that
the
sufficient
amount
--
sufficient
quantum
of
evidence
to
overcome
that
presumption.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
think
we
can
take
that
position.
i
would
like
to
make
a
distinction,
if
i
may,
between
the
--
an
expression
of
an
opinion
which
might
itself
disrupt
the
class
and
the
expression
of
an
opinion
which
might
cause
someone
else
to
disrupt
the
class.
and
i
believe
those
are
perhaps
two
separate
cases.
i
also
like
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
expression
of
an
opinion
which
is
coupled
with
something
else,
like
marching
in
the
hallway
or
standing
up
in
the
class
and
making
a
speech
about
the
war
in
vietnam
during
mathematics
class.
that
kind
of
thing,
i
think
the
court
can
prohibit,
but
we
are
in
a
situation
here
where
the
record
just
simply
doesn't
support
that
kind
of
a
situation.
rather
it
supports
the
idea
that
before
anyone
wore
armband
really
on
the
basis
of
pure
conjecture
that
the
policy
was
adopted
frankly
for
the
purpose
and
the
administrators
and
the
teachers
say
this
over
and
over
again,
it
was
the
principle
of
the
demonstration,
the
idea
of
expressing
political
beliefs
that
they
were
opposed
to
in
this
context.
and
that
the
students
were
suspended
for
violating
that
policy
and
not
suspended
for
causing
any
disruption
in
the
classroom.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
think
that
would
probably
your
honor
interfere
with
some
earlier
decisions
of
this
court
probably
in
regard
to
the
right
of
individuals
of
citizens
to
establish
private
schools
and
so
long
as
they
meet
the
accreditation
standards
to
educate
their
children
as
they
see
fit.
i
believe
that's
probably
a
different
kind
of
situation
from
what
we
have
here.
the
situation
here,
as
i
view
it,
is
based
not
so
much
upon
the
conduct
of
the
students,
whether
or
not
it
was
permissible
but
the
conduct
of
the
state
whether
or
not
the
conduct
of
the
state
was
permissible.
whether
or
not
where
we
have
a
situation
of
pure
expression
and
nothing
else
which
was
no
evidence
of
any
material
or
substantial
disruption
of
any
public
interest,
whether
or
not
in
that
situation
the
state
can
move
to
subordinate
and
to
punish
freedom
of
expression.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
the
case
is
not
moot
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
your
honor
the
students
each
testified
in
the
district
court,
and
this
will
appear
in
the
record,
that
although
they
did
return
to
school
because
of
the
obvious
dire
consequences
to
themselves
if
they
do
not
return
to
school,
that
they
still
have
these
views
in
the
war
in
vietnam.
they
still
have
the
desire
to
wear
armbands
to
express
their
opposition
to
the
war
in

that
--
mr.

johnston
it's
in
the
appendix
your
honor,
that
testimony
in
the
record.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
yes,
it
is
in
the
complaint.
yes,
it
was
alleged
in
the
complaint.
mr.
dan

johnston
the

and
in
any
event
because
we
anticipated
the
possibility
that
by
the
time
the
case
might
be
finally
decided.
the
students
might
no
longer
be
in
school
and
might
no
longer
have
that
interest.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
that's
right,
we
did
your
honor.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
that's
what
i
was
getting
to.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
not
your
honor
in
a
case
that
goes
up
under
the

under

code

than
under

mr.

johnston
yes,
your
honor
it
is.
mr.
dan

johnston
i've
also
--
well,
yes.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
your
honor
we'll
hope
for
that
of
course.
i
would
say
that
the
prayer
for
damages
is
still
there.
the
students
were
still
out
of
school
for
six
days
in
the
instance
of
two,
five
days
in
the
instance
of
one.
i
would
also
say
to
the
court
to
speaking
very
frankly
that
my
own
experience
and
i'm
sure
the
court's
experience
is
that
this
is
not
an
isolated
problem,
that
the
correct
balance
between
the
interest
of
the
school
in
maintaining
discipline
and
decorum
and
the
rights
of
the
students
who,
because
i
believe
of
the
improvement
in
american
education,
have
increasingly
moved
to
have
opinions
and
to
want
to
express
opinions,
that
this
kind
of
situation
arises
and
will
continue
to
arise.
and
we
suggest
that
this
case
provides
a
good
context
for
the
court
provide
guidance
for
the
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
your
honor,
i
really
would
not
think
it
would
get
you
any
further
in
that
sort
of
thing
then
in
barnette
versus
board
of
education
of
west
virginia
than
did
the
case
that
the
court
announced
this
morning.
they
did
a
number
of
other
cases
where
the
court
has
held
that
whatever
are
the
delicate
functions
of
school
boards
and
there
are
certainly
delicate,
especially
these
days,
that
they
still
have
no
function
which
cannot
be
exercised
within
the
purview
and
within
the
dictates
of
this
court's
decision
under
the
first
amendment.
and
that's
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
i
understand.
those
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
mr.
justice
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
believe
that
the
real
question
in
that
regard
hinges
upon
whether
or
not
the
utterance
is
expression,
as
contemplated
by
the
first
amendment
which
was
a
finding
that
the
district
court
made,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
students
were
engaged
and
the
expression
of
views
privileged
by
the
first
amendment
unless
it's
subordinated
by
some
other
state
interest.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
my
opinion
would
be,
in
that
instance,
that
probably,
again
it
would
depend
a
lot
upon
what
the
students
said
and
demeanor
of
the
student
when
he
expressed
the
things
of
that
sort
that
that
probably
would
not
be
within
the
purview
of
the
first
amendment,
but
again
it's
just
conjecture
on
my
part.
certainly
just
to
wear
one's
haircut
the
way
wants
one,
and
way
wants
to
may
present
fourteenth
amendment
problems,
as
arbitrariness
and
things
of
that
sort.
but
it
does
not
present
per
se
first
amendment
problems
such
as
we
have
here.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
never
was
made.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
no,
they
did
not
your
honor.
they
--
by
the
time
they
got
finally
to
the
board,
they
felt
the
necessity
i
believe
to
sustain
the
action
of
their
principles.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
this
was
the,
generally,
the
public
schools
is
des
moines.
three
schools
involved.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
the
--
mr.
eckhardt
was
in
the
10th
grade
your
honor
at
roosevelt
high
school.
mr.
tinker
was
in
the
11th
grade
at
north
high
school,
and
mary
beth
tinker
was
in
the
13th
grade
at
warren
harding
junior
high
school.
no,
excuse
me
the
8th
grade
at
warren
harding
junior
high
school.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
to
the
extent,
your
honor
that
those
people
have
views
and
can
express
them
within
the
purview
of
the
first
amendment
it
would,
yes.
i
should
not
think
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
special
rule
for
schools
or
any
other
par
of
our
society
for
the
first
amendment.
now,
the
evidence
of
disruption
might
be
different
but
as
far
as
the
principles
apply,
we'd
like
to
have
the
same
principles
applied
in
the
school
or
perhaps
especially
in
the
school
that
are
applied
elsewhere.
if
i
may
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
argument
for
rebuttal.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
thank
you
your
honor.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out,
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice,
one
of
the
things
which
i
believe
it's
been
mentioned
but
needs
to
be
mentioned
more
firmly
and
that
was
that
there
was
in
the
school
no
general
prohibition
against
political
emblems
of
this
nature.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
the
school
was
acting,
your
honor,
under
a
very
broad
state
statute
which
gives
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
no,
your
honor.
the
question
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
yes,
i
think
that's
true.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
it
gives
them
the
power
to
do,
yes
your
honor.
but
i,
the
point
i'm
--
i'd
like
to
impress
upon
the
court
this
time
is
on
pages
44
and
50
and
51
of
the
record.
it's
very
amply
stated
by
respondents
that
other
kinds
of
political
insignia
including
the
iron
cross
were
worn
in
the
schools
that
they
were
not
covered
by
this
policy,
that
there
was
no
policy
covering
them,
that
it
was
simply
this
one
policy
against
the
wearing
of
the
armbands
in
this
context.
now,
counsel
indicates
that
there
was
some
sort
of
explosive
situation
which
made
this
as
a
special
circumstance.
i
can't
of
course
recite
to
the
record
to
prove
a
negative.
i
can
just
simply
say
that
i
don't
believe
that
the
record
supports
that
kind
of
a
situation.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
yes,
your
honor
it
is
but
our
point
is
that
the
rule
is
not
valid.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
because
it's
based
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
--
and
because
it's
based
solely
upon
a
fourteenth
amendment
alone
type
stand
of
reasonableness.
and
this
court
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
well,
for
instance
in
the
case
of
--
in
the
barnette
case
which
we've
cited
in
the
brief
which
was
the
case
of
the
compulsory
flag
salute.
this
court
specifically
said
that
mere
fourteenth
amendment
test
of
reasonableness
are
not
sufficient
in
the
schools
when
the
students
are
engaged
in
something
or
where
the
conduct
involves
something
that's
privilege
under
the
first
amendment.
that's
the
suggestion
we
have
here.
now,
the
reasons
for
the
school
board
establishing
the
regulation
are
set
out
in
page
70
of
the
record
at
quite
some
length
by
a
document
promulgated
by
the
school
board
itself.
counsel
referred
to
them,
those
reasons
which
were
by
the
way
passed
or
at
least
reduced
the
paper
after
the
suspensions
in
a
week
after
the
suspensions.
simply
to
my
reading
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
do
not
provide
sufficient
grounds
for
the
subordination
of
freedom
of
expression.
now,
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
it
would
not
--
it
has
that
power.
i
believe
it
has
the
power
but
it's
not
necessary
in
this
case
because
that's
not
what
they've
done,
your
honor.
they've
banned
only
the
discussion
in
one
specific
instance
and
that's
all
there
is.
now,
i
--
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
in
addition
to
the
other
argument
that
i
want
to
make
and
that
is
--
and
i
believe
the
stronger
argument
is
not
the
equal
protection
argument,
not
the
censorship
by
discrimination
argument
mr.
justice
black
has
called
it.
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
stronger
argument
is
that
the
interest
of
the
state
sought
to
protect
whatever
that
may
have
been
it's
set
out
on
page
70
of
the
record
simply
was
not
sufficient
where
as
it
might
have
been
sufficient
to
justify
the
suppression
of
something
it
was
privileged
under
the
first
amendment.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
your
honor,
i
don't
read
that
from
the
record.
i
believe
that
--
i
believe
in
the
record
to
what
the
school
wants.
mr.
dan
l.
johnston
the
authorities
that
are
running
the
schools
under
the
authority
given
by
them
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
within
the
provisions
of
that
constitution.
and
the
whole
number
of
our
case
is
that
they
of
course
that
they've
exceeded
their
powers
under
that.
thank
you.
