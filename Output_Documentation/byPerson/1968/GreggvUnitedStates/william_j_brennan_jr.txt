justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
really
anything
for
us
to
decide
beyond
whether
the
rule
is
going
to
be
enforced
as
written?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
it's
a
prophylactic
rule,
whether
or
not
there's
prejudice,
i
would
suppose,
is
unimportant.
if,
under
the
language
of
the
rule,
it
means
what
it
says,
then
what
happened
here
was
wrong.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don't
even
see
why
you
talk
about
prejudice.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
your
position
is
that
the
rule
should
be
enforced
is
written,
why
isn't
that
the
end
of
your
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
resentence,
in
this
case,
is
meaningless
because
it's
a
mandatory
sentence,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
25
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
mean,
in
your
--
in
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
you
--
one
of
your
arguments,
that
it's
not
enough
just
to
send
it
back
for
resentences
that
the
judge
is
powerless
to
give
him
anything
less
then.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
five
years,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
must
say,
from
what
the
court
revealed
of
what
the
presentence
investigation
report
contained
at
page
7,
it
must've
been
a
lengthy
report.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
certainly
had
quite
a
record,
didn't
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
juvenile
record,
1960,
an
automobile
--
stolen
automobile,
parole
in
1965,
parole
in
1962,
parole
violator
in
1965,
convicted
of
armed
robbery
in
arizona,
7-10
years,
several
warrants
now
against
him
charging
robbery.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
in
the
long
report.
that
was
in
the
competency
report,
too.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
gordon
--
mr.
richards,
when
did
this
rule
take
its
present
form?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
these
criminal
rules
were
recently
revised,
you
think--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
1966?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask,
mr.
glazer,
i
take
it
part
of
that
six
minutes
was
taken
up
by
the
judge's
polling
each
of
the
jurors.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
it
wasn't
part
of
the
six
minutes
taken
up
by
the
judge
just
polling
the
jury.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
the
judge
said
“i'll
ask
each
individual
juror
if
that's
your
verdict,”
whereupon
all
jurors
indicate
“affirmatively.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why
should
you
assume
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
just
to
uphold
your
reason,
i
didn't
do
it
that
way.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then,
apparently,
the
judge
had
some
problem
whether
or
not
he
should
ask
the
jury
to
come
back
and
that
took
a
little
time
for
this
colloquy,
didn't
it,
out
of
the
six
minutes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mean
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
some
of
the
six
minutes
taken
up
by
his
polling
the
jury
and
some
of
the
six
minutes
taken
up
while
he
checked
on
whether
or
not
they
were
to
be
called
back
and,
after
that
was
done,
then
he
said
“let
the
defendant
come
forward.”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
much
of
the
six
minutes
was
left
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
this
trial
was
on
may
31,
not
may
19.
that's
what
the
record
at
page
4
shows,
and
the
verdict
--
the
sentence
was
on
june
1,
not
on
may
19.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
alright.
that
indicates
that
the
judge
may
have
had
the
report
for
two
weeks
before
the
trial
began
which
is
even
worse
violation
of
the
rule.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
