mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case
and
petitioner's
argument
rest
upon
the
assumption
that
the
district
judge
saw
the
probation
report
prior
to
the
time
the
jury
returned
its
verdict.
while
we
believe
strenuously
that
this
assumption
is
not
supported
by
the
fa
--
by
the
record
and
that
this
assumption
developed
from
the
manner
in
which
the
issue
was
presented
below,
it
is
also
our
position
that
there
is
no
occasion
to
set
aside
this
conviction
even
if
the
trial
judge
saw
the
report
prematurely.
we
reach
this
conclusion
because
it
affirmly
--
affirmably
appears
in
this
record
that
petitioner
could
not
have
been
prejudiced
either
by
the
jury's
determination
of
guilt
or
by
any
of
the
court's
ruling
by
a
premature
examination
of
the
probation
report.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
1948,
this
is
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
1948
and
the
rules
were
recently
amended
in
1966.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
it's
been
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
it's
been
that
way
since
1948.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
petitioner
has
pointed
out
that
the
record
shows
that,
immediately
following
the
verdict,
the
jury
was
polled,
defendant
was
called
for
resentencing,
and
the
court
advised
him
of
the
mandatory
25-year
sentence
which
a
statute
imposes
for
the
robbery
of
a
postal
station
when
lies
in
jeo
--
when
lies
are
placed
in
jeopardy
by
a
dangerous
weapon.
at
that
point,
the
court
asked
defense
counsel
and
defendant
if
they
have
anything
to
say
before
sentence
was
pronounced.
defense
counsel
then
requested
delay
in
sentencing
the
following
week
to
enable
petitioner
to
spend
a
few
more
days
with
his
family.
when
the
court
indicated
that
such
a
stay
would
not
be
granted,
the
defense
counsel
asked
for
a
presentence
report.
the
court,
at
this
point,
replied
that
“a
presentence
investigation
has
been
made
and
it
is
before
me
now.
i
have
read
it.”
the
court,
thereupon,
sentenced
the
defendant
to
the
mandatory
25-year
sentence.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
record
doesn't
reflect
how
long
that
took,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
that
may
be
--
that's
right,
excuse
me.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
six
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
considering
the
options
that
the
judge
had,
the
judge
could've
scanned
the
probation
report
during
the
time
of
sentencing.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
your
honor.
he
could've
looked
at
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
probation
report
has
been
lodged
with
the
clerk's
office.
we
--
the
--
we
had
the
probation
--
we
went
to
the
probation
officer
and
asked
him
to
send
the
report
to
the
clerk
of
this
court.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
report
is
four
pages
long.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
if
the
judge
had
said
“i
am
reading
the
report”
or
“i
have
scanned
it,”
we
wouldn't
have
a
lawsuit
here.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
“i
have
read
it.”
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
and
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
he
--
this
is
a
situation
and
he
could've
read
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
he
could've
read
it,
speed-read
it,
during
the
six-minute
period
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
considering
the
fact
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
your
honor,
there
isn't.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
in
the
first
place,
all
defense
counsel
said
during
this
period
is
“i
want
to
stay
until
monday
morning
because
my
client
is
facing
a
long
sentence
and
i
would
like
him
to
spend
the
last
few
days
with
his
family.”
now
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
and
it'd
be
very
simple
for
the
district
judge
to
just
scan
the
report
because
this
is
not
a
sit
--
this
is
a
case
where
the
district
judge
was
familiar
with
the
defendant's
background.
six
weeks
earlier,
he
had
a
psychiatric
report
which
detailed
defendant's
prior
record,
detailed
defendant's
prior
psychological
and
psychiatric
problems.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
once
you
have
a
probation
report
in
the
case
and
once
the
issue
of
competency
is
in
the
lawsuit,
the
judge
cannot
divorce
that
issue
in
--
from
his
mind
throughout
the
lawsuit
because
any
of
he
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
should
it
be
prejudiced
by
it?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
there's
no
indication
that
he
was
prejudiced
by
it.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
and
he
knew
about
his
social
history
and
the
problems
of
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
probation
report
has
significance
but,
in
this
situation,
what
did
the
judge
have
to
decide
on
sentencing?
this
is
not
a
case
where
he
had
the
right
to
decide
to
impose
any
sentence
up
to
25
years.
he
had
--
his
options
were
two,
either
place
this
man
on
probation
or
give
him
the
mandatory
25-year
sentence.
now,
this
man
had
been
also
--
this
was
--
came
out
in
the
elements
of
the
case
as
well
as
the
psychiatric
report,
had
been
the
week
following
the
date
that
this
crime
was
committed,
had
been
arrested
for
bank
robbery
in
another
state.
and,
that
case
was
also
pending
in
the
federal
court.
he
--
and
the
judge,
therefore,
knew
he
either
had
to
put
him
on
probation
or
sentence
him
to
25
years.
the
facts
of
this
crime
was
such
that
the
defendant
here
with
a
companion
went
into
a
postal
substation,
tied
and
gagged
two
women,
put
a
gun
on
the
one
woman's
head,
an
threaten
to
blow
her
brains
out.
now,
on
these
circumstances,
the
judge
didn't
have
to
study
every
single
word
of
the
probation
report
to
realize
he's
not
going
to
put
the
man
on
probation.
he
doesn't
have
to
study
every
single
word
to
decide
“should
i
give
him
5
years
or
7
years
or
25
years?”
his
options
are
either
25
years
or
probation,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the
type
of
case
where
he
can
just
scan
the
report
and,
on
the
basis
of
that,
decide
that
this
is
not
a
case
for
probation
and,
since
his
hands
are
tied
by
congress,
impose
the
25-year
mandatory
sentence.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what
was
the
date
of
trial?
i
think
the
date
of
trial
was
in
may
1967,
which
was
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
five
or
six
weeks
after
arraignment.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
trial
lasted
one
day.
the
evidence
consisted
of
the
two
women
who
were
in
the
postal
substation
and
also
some
evidence
concerning
the
defendant
being
arrested
in
a
motel
with
the
gun
and
blank
money
orders
which
had
been
taken
from
the
station
and,
also,
there
is
also
evidence
that
on
the
day
proceeding
--
on
the
day
of
the
robbery,
the
same
--
the
gun
in
which
the
defendant
was
found
in
possession
was
purchased
in
louisville
which
was
the
place
of
the
robbery.
the
defendant
offered
no
evidence.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that
was
all
the
evidence.
the
defendant
offered
no
evidence.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
it
indicates
--
the
record
indicates
the
jury
was
polled,
but
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
think
it
was.
it
may
have
been,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
all
--
in
the
poll
consisted
of
not
asking
each
jury
individually
“is
this
your
verdict?”
but
looking
at
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
well,
it's
not
a
situa
--
now,
it's
--
you
can't
tell
from
this
record,
i
assume
from
this
record,
that
this
was
a
situation
where
all
12
jurors
shook
their
head
affirmatively.
instead
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
maybe
it's
the
other
way,
but
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
normally,
if
the
juries
are
polled
the
other
way,
“mr.
so-and-so,
is
this
your
verdict?”
the
court
reporter
would
write
it
down
in
the
record.
and
since
the
court
reported
--
didn't
record
it
in
the
report,
i
assume
it's
the
other
way.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
it
took
some
time.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
and,
it
also--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
and
also,
on
the
other
hand,
when
the
judge
came
to
recite
the
defendant's
record,
it
indi
--
it
seems
that
he's
reading
the
record
at
that
time.
in
other
words,
like
he's
looking
at
--
he
says
“it
shows
in
1960,
this
defendant
stole
an
automobile
and
was
given
a
deter
--
an
indeterminate
youth
commitment
sentence.
he
was
paroled
in
1965.”
he
was
returned
--
no,
it
indicates
that
he
is
actually
--
he
was
actually
reading
the
defendant's
past
record.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
he
did,
your
honor.
he
did,
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
both
the
defendant
and
his
lawyer,
the
only
thing
they
said
was
that
they
would
like
some
time,
another
couple
of
days,
the
defendant
can
remain
out
on
bond
and
be
with
his
wife.
there
was
no
--
neither
the
defendant
nor
his
counsel
made
any
argument
or
suggestion
or
--
of
any
mitigating
factors
at
all.
he
allowed
them
to
say
what
they
wanted,
and
they
were
just
interested
--
i
have
the
view
point
from
this
record
that
they
expected
the
mandatory
25-year
sentence
and
they
cited
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
it
seem
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
i
think
that
the
whole
thing
boils
down
to
what
is
only
six
minutes
is
because
you
know
that
the
congress
hasn't
given
the
federal
judge
any
choice
in
this
case.
if
the
federal
judge
had
a
choice,
“should
i
give
him
5
years,
10
years,
15
years,
20
years,
or
25
years?,”
that
would
be
a
different
situation,
but
that's
not
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
jud
--
congress
has
said
“you
have
to
impose
a
25-year
penalty.”
from
the
evidence
in
this
case,
i
submit,
that
this
--
the
judge
wouldn't
--
would've
ruled
out
probation
just
from
the
evidence
in
this
case.
so,
this--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
in
this
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
he
did
pay
some
attention
to
it,
but
i
think
he
paid
the
attention
to
that
all
this
report
--
all
he
had
to
do,
all
this
report
--
this
case
required
is
not
--
if
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
that
if
he
had
a
situation
where
he
could
tailor
the
sentence
to
fix
--
to
fit
the
individual,
yes,
i
say
maybe
he
should
spend
more
time.
but,
this
is
a
case
where
he
doesn't
have
that
option.
he
only
had
to
decide
is
“whether
i
should
put
this
man
on
probation.”
and
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
from
the
defendant's
past
record
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
record
in
this
case
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
show
when
the
probation
report
was
giv
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
court
has
assumed
that
there's
six
minutes
on
the
basis
of
the
jury
returning
--
from
the
government's
brief
that
says
the
jury
returned
its
verdict
at
3:24
and
then,
that
the
sentencing
procedure
occurred
and
was
concluded
at
3:30.
it's
in
the
transcript.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
it's
that
where
there's
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
before
the
trial
commenced.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
understand
that
the
practice
in
this
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
record
here
does
show
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
excuse
me,
your
honor.
if
i
did,
i
made
a
mistake.
it's
true,
not
mr.
justice
brennan
is
correct.
the
trial
was
on
may
31.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
this
record
does
not
reflect
when
the
probation
officer
submitted
the
report
to
the
judge.
i
understand
it's
the
practice
in
this
district
for
the
probation
officer
to
remain
in
the
courtroom
while
the
jury
is
out
and
then
when
the
jury
reaches
its
verdict
and,
if
the
verdict
is
guilty,
at
that
time,
it's
the
common
practice
of
this
district
for
the
probation
officer
to
deliver
the
report
to
the
court.
it
also--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
record
has
no
indication
at
all.
the
record
--
that's
what--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i'm
not
--
i'm
just
--
i'm
not
asking
you.
i'm
just
saying
what
the
practice
is.
this
record
does
not
have
any
indication
as
to
when
the
probation
report
was
submitted
to
the
court,
none
whatsoever.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
my
position
is
that
whether
a
judge
has
a
probation
report
or
not
is
optional.
a
judge
that
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
correct
that
he
had
one.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
judge
have
--
the
moderate
time
a
judge
spend
on
a
probation
report
varies
with
the
individual
case.
if
he
has
a
case
of
a
first
offender
or
where
there's
a
--
where
he
has
an
option
of
putting
a
first
offender
on
probation,
i'd
say
he
should
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
the
probation
report,
perhaps
ask
the
probation
off
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
i
don't
--
i
think,
in
this
case,
where
he
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
in
this
case,
there
would
be
no
need
for
a
probation
report
because
he
did
not
have
any
option
as
to
what
sentence
to
impose.
this
is
a
clear
case
where
probation
should
have
been
denied.
i
can't
conceive
the
judge
placing
a
man
on
probation
who,
shortly
after
--
shortly
before
this
crime
was
committed,
he
had
been
released
from
a
prior
institution
and
had
violated
a
parole
previously.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
i
would
think
that
one
thing
he'd
be
interested
is
whether
the
probation
officer's
can
--
recommendation
agrees
with
his.
if
the
probation
officer's
recommendation
agrees
with
his
impression
of
the
case,
then
i
don't
think
he
has
to
scan
every
line
and
carefully
read
each
word.
i
think
the
judge
properly,
based
on
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
the
--
just
what
he
read
in
open
court
about
defendant's
past
history,
that
was
enough.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
don't
see
any
virtue
of
delaying
the
sentencing
process.
if
--
once
--
if
the
judge
is
clear,
the
judge
is
clear
that
this
man
rob
the
postal
station
with
a
deadly
weapon
and
he's
been
out
on
bond
before,
seems
to
me
that
the
--
and
if
he
doesn't
sentence
him,
he'll
remain
out
on
bond,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
very
reasonable
for
the
judge
to
sentence
him
on
the
spot,
and
there's
no
reason
for
the
delay.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
clearly.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
would
say
not
in
this
case
for
this
reason.
where
it
apparently
appears
from
the
record,
as
it
does
in
this
case,
that
neither
defendant's
trial,
the
determination
of
his
guilt,
the
rulings
of
the
judge,
or
the
sentence
were
affected
in
any
way
by
the
judge
obtaining
the
report
prior
to
verdict
that
there's
no
reason
to
give
him
a
new
trial.
the
reason
i
say
that
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
we
--
no,
i'd
say
the
government
will
take
the
burden
of
showing
lack
of
prejudice
and
i
say,
in
this
case,
lack
of
prejudice
appears
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
an
examination
of
the
probation
report
and
the
psychiatric
report
shows
that
the
probation
report
is
derived
principally
from
the
psychiatric
report.
so,
if
the
judge,
the
judge
who
was
required
to
examine
the
psychiatric
report
prior
to
trial,
he
even
may
have
had
the
psychiatric
report
in
front
of
him
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
we
will
accept
that.
we'll
accept
that,
but
--
we'll
accept
that
rule
that
the
government
should
have
the
burden
of
showing
lack
of
prejudice.
and,
we
say,
in
this
case,
because
of
the
psychiatric
report,
lack
of
prejudice
is
clear
beyond
any
doubt.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
the
record
doesn't
show
as
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
defendant
wasn't
denied
an
opportunity
to
receive
the
report.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
the
rule
was
changed
in
1966.
the
rule
was
changed
in
1966
which
--
and
it
provides
now,
the
court,
before
imposing
sentence,
may
disclose
to
the
defendant
or
his
counsel
all
or
part
of
the
material
contained
in
the
presentence
investigation.
and,
i
say,
if
a
defendant
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
he
didn't
ask
for
it,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
he
never
asked
the
district
judge
to
see
all
or
any
part
of
the
probation
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
it
says
“may.”
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
“may,”
right.
that's
discretionary.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
and
the
reason
the
court
has
discretion
is
there
are
certain
situations
where
there
may
be
confidential
information
in
the
probation
report,
for
example
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
in
fact,
that's
been
a
great
dispute.
no.
i,
in
my
own
opinion,
in
the
absence
of
confidential
information
in
the
report
such
as
from
a
man's
employer
or
some
sort
of
informant
are
from
a
social
service
agency,
i
think
that
the
report
should
be
disclosed.
but,
the
rules
committee
didn't
go
that
far
and
they
placed
it
in
the
discretion
of
the
district
judge
and
some
judge
disclosed
it
and
others
don't.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
he
said
“i
would
like
to
ask
that
a
presentence
investigation
be
made.”
he
didn't
ask
to
see
the
report.
he
asked
the
court
for
--
that
the
presentence
investigation
be
made.
at
that
point,
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
it
--
to
me,
that's
the
impression
i
have
is
he
wanted
the
probation
officer
to
conduct
a
presentence
investigation.
he
didn't
ask
the
court
to
show
him
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
he
could've
said
that,
right,
and,
apparently,
it
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
apparently,
i
assume
that
he
assumed
that
he
didn't
realize
that
a
report
had
--
an
investigation
had
commenced.
the
petitioner's
appendix,
page
7,
it
clearly
shows
what
happened
here.
mr.
richards:
“your
honor,
i
would
like
to
ask
that
a
presentence
be
made
of
--"
the
court
interrupting:
“a
presentence
investigation
has
been
made
and
it
is
before
me
now
and
i
have
read
it.”
it
says
it
shows
it
direct.
he
makes
a
--
reads
briefly
from
it
in
one
continuing
sentence.
and,
in
three
paragraphs,
he
goes
ahead
and
states
briefly
what
the
presentence
report
says
in
part
and
then
says
“it
will
be
the
judgment
of
this
court
that
this
defendant
be
sentenced
to
the
mandatory
25
years
custody
to
the
martial.”
the
petitioner
was
not
given
the
right
of
allocution
after
the
petitioner
was
informed
that
a
presentence
had
been
made
or
that
the
record
was
before
the
court.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
as
i
just
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
defense
counsel
stated,
“your
honor,
i
would
like
to
ask
that
a
presentence
investigation
be
made
of
--
“he
was
interrupted
in
the
middle
of
his
motion,
his
request."
but
then,
the
court
stated
that
there
one
had
--
that
one
had
been
made
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
defendant
or
his
lawyer
wasn't
given
the
chance
to
say
anything.
the
court
said
that
there
had
been
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
he
cut
him
off.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
court
stated
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
because
he
had
stated
it
was
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
page
7
of
the
appendix.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
when
i
find
out
that
a
presentence
investigation
had
been
made,
that
the
court
had
read
it,
and
then
the
court
pronounced
sentence.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
“custody
of
the
martial.”
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
maybe
if
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
at
this
time,
we
were
so
surprised
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
we
were
so
surprised
that
a
presentence
investigation
had
been
made
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
because
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
at
this
time
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
it
certainly
was
not,
except
the
defendant
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
did
i
want
to
see
the
presentence
investigation?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
at
that
time,
no.
the
defendant
turned,
walked
away
in
the
custody
of
the
martial.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
the
defendant
--
the
marital
stepped
forward.
the
defendant
was
taken
from
the
courtroom
immediately.
then,
we
were
later
brought
back
and
he
was
advised
of
his
appellate
rights
some
minutes
later,
10-15
minutes
later,
after
i
had
left
to
get
my
car
started
from
the
parking
lot.
then,
we
were
brought
back
in
the
courtroom
and
advised
of
the
appellate
rights
that
the
petitioner
had.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
at
that
time,
i
had
nothing
to
say,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
was
requesting
that
a
presentence
investigation
be
made.
mr.
gregg
--
this
was
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
this
was
all
about
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
correct,
and
i
was
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
correct.
i
was
not
going
to
ask
that
the
report
be
destroyed
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
your
honor,
i
believe
i
am.
thank
you.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
at
this
time,
i
was
not
going
to
ask.
i
was
only
asking
that
a
presentence
investigation
be
made
and
i
was
not
going
to
ask
that
it
be
disclosed
to
the
petitioner
or
his
counsel.
thank
you.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case
and
petitioner's
argument
rest
upon
the
assumption
that
the
district
judge
saw
the
probation
report
prior
to
the
time
the
jury
returned
its
verdict.
while
we
believe
strenuously
that
this
assumption
is
not
supported
by
the
fa
--
by
the
record
and
that
this
assumption
developed
from
the
manner
in
which
the
issue
was
presented
below,
it
is
also
our
position
that
there
is
no
occasion
to
set
aside
this
conviction
even
if
the
trial
judge
saw
the
report
prematurely.
we
reach
this
conclusion
because
it
affirmly
--
affirmably
appears
in
this
record
that
petitioner
could
not
have
been
prejudiced
either
by
the
jury's
determination
of
guilt
or
by
any
of
the
court's
ruling
by
a
premature
examination
of
the
probation
report.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
1948,
this
is
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
1948
and
the
rules
were
recently
amended
in
1966.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
it's
been
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
it's
been
that
way
since
1948.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
petitioner
has
pointed
out
that
the
record
shows
that,
immediately
following
the
verdict,
the
jury
was
polled,
defendant
was
called
for
resentencing,
and
the
court
advised
him
of
the
mandatory
25-year
sentence
which
a
statute
imposes
for
the
robbery
of
a
postal
station
when
lies
in
jeo
--
when
lies
are
placed
in
jeopardy
by
a
dangerous
weapon.
at
that
point,
the
court
asked
defense
counsel
and
defendant
if
they
have
anything
to
say
before
sentence
was
pronounced.
defense
counsel
then
requested
delay
in
sentencing
the
following
week
to
enable
petitioner
to
spend
a
few
more
days
with
his
family.
when
the
court
indicated
that
such
a
stay
would
not
be
granted,
the
defense
counsel
asked
for
a
presentence
report.
the
court,
at
this
point,
replied
that
“a
presentence
investigation
has
been
made
and
it
is
before
me
now.
i
have
read
it.”
the
court,
thereupon,
sentenced
the
defendant
to
the
mandatory
25-year
sentence.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
record
doesn't
reflect
how
long
that
took,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
that
may
be
--
that's
right,
excuse
me.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
six
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
considering
the
options
that
the
judge
had,
the
judge
could've
scanned
the
probation
report
during
the
time
of
sentencing.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
your
honor.
he
could've
looked
at
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
probation
report
has
been
lodged
with
the
clerk's
office.
we
--
the
--
we
had
the
probation
--
we
went
to
the
probation
officer
and
asked
him
to
send
the
report
to
the
clerk
of
this
court.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
report
is
four
pages
long.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
if
the
judge
had
said
“i
am
reading
the
report”
or
“i
have
scanned
it,”
we
wouldn't
have
a
lawsuit
here.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
“i
have
read
it.”
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
and
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
he
--
this
is
a
situation
and
he
could've
read
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
he
could've
read
it,
speed-read
it,
during
the
six-minute
period
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
considering
the
fact
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
your
honor,
there
isn't.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
in
the
first
place,
all
defense
counsel
said
during
this
period
is
“i
want
to
stay
until
monday
morning
because
my
client
is
facing
a
long
sentence
and
i
would
like
him
to
spend
the
last
few
days
with
his
family.”
now
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
and
it'd
be
very
simple
for
the
district
judge
to
just
scan
the
report
because
this
is
not
a
sit
--
this
is
a
case
where
the
district
judge
was
familiar
with
the
defendant's
background.
six
weeks
earlier,
he
had
a
psychiatric
report
which
detailed
defendant's
prior
record,
detailed
defendant's
prior
psychological
and
psychiatric
problems.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
once
you
have
a
probation
report
in
the
case
and
once
the
issue
of
competency
is
in
the
lawsuit,
the
judge
cannot
divorce
that
issue
in
--
from
his
mind
throughout
the
lawsuit
because
any
of
he
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
should
it
be
prejudiced
by
it?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
there's
no
indication
that
he
was
prejudiced
by
it.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
and
he
knew
about
his
social
history
and
the
problems
of
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
probation
report
has
significance
but,
in
this
situation,
what
did
the
judge
have
to
decide
on
sentencing?
this
is
not
a
case
where
he
had
the
right
to
decide
to
impose
any
sentence
up
to
25
years.
he
had
--
his
options
were
two,
either
place
this
man
on
probation
or
give
him
the
mandatory
25-year
sentence.
now,
this
man
had
been
also
--
this
was
--
came
out
in
the
elements
of
the
case
as
well
as
the
psychiatric
report,
had
been
the
week
following
the
date
that
this
crime
was
committed,
had
been
arrested
for
bank
robbery
in
another
state.
and,
that
case
was
also
pending
in
the
federal
court.
he
--
and
the
judge,
therefore,
knew
he
either
had
to
put
him
on
probation
or
sentence
him
to
25
years.
the
facts
of
this
crime
was
such
that
the
defendant
here
with
a
companion
went
into
a
postal
substation,
tied
and
gagged
two
women,
put
a
gun
on
the
one
woman's
head,
an
threaten
to
blow
her
brains
out.
now,
on
these
circumstances,
the
judge
didn't
have
to
study
every
single
word
of
the
probation
report
to
realize
he's
not
going
to
put
the
man
on
probation.
he
doesn't
have
to
study
every
single
word
to
decide
“should
i
give
him
5
years
or
7
years
or
25
years?”
his
options
are
either
25
years
or
probation,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the
type
of
case
where
he
can
just
scan
the
report
and,
on
the
basis
of
that,
decide
that
this
is
not
a
case
for
probation
and,
since
his
hands
are
tied
by
congress,
impose
the
25-year
mandatory
sentence.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what
was
the
date
of
trial?
i
think
the
date
of
trial
was
in
may
1967,
which
was
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
five
or
six
weeks
after
arraignment.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
trial
lasted
one
day.
the
evidence
consisted
of
the
two
women
who
were
in
the
postal
substation
and
also
some
evidence
concerning
the
defendant
being
arrested
in
a
motel
with
the
gun
and
blank
money
orders
which
had
been
taken
from
the
station
and,
also,
there
is
also
evidence
that
on
the
day
proceeding
--
on
the
day
of
the
robbery,
the
same
--
the
gun
in
which
the
defendant
was
found
in
possession
was
purchased
in
louisville
which
was
the
place
of
the
robbery.
the
defendant
offered
no
evidence.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that
was
all
the
evidence.
the
defendant
offered
no
evidence.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
it
indicates
--
the
record
indicates
the
jury
was
polled,
but
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
think
it
was.
it
may
have
been,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
all
--
in
the
poll
consisted
of
not
asking
each
jury
individually
“is
this
your
verdict?”
but
looking
at
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
well,
it's
not
a
situa
--
now,
it's
--
you
can't
tell
from
this
record,
i
assume
from
this
record,
that
this
was
a
situation
where
all
12
jurors
shook
their
head
affirmatively.
instead
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
maybe
it's
the
other
way,
but
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
normally,
if
the
juries
are
polled
the
other
way,
“mr.
so-and-so,
is
this
your
verdict?”
the
court
reporter
would
write
it
down
in
the
record.
and
since
the
court
reported
--
didn't
record
it
in
the
report,
i
assume
it's
the
other
way.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
it
took
some
time.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
and,
it
also--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
and
also,
on
the
other
hand,
when
the
judge
came
to
recite
the
defendant's
record,
it
indi
--
it
seems
that
he's
reading
the
record
at
that
time.
in
other
words,
like
he's
looking
at
--
he
says
“it
shows
in
1960,
this
defendant
stole
an
automobile
and
was
given
a
deter
--
an
indeterminate
youth
commitment
sentence.
he
was
paroled
in
1965.”
he
was
returned
--
no,
it
indicates
that
he
is
actually
--
he
was
actually
reading
the
defendant's
past
record.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
he
did,
your
honor.
he
did,
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
both
the
defendant
and
his
lawyer,
the
only
thing
they
said
was
that
they
would
like
some
time,
another
couple
of
days,
the
defendant
can
remain
out
on
bond
and
be
with
his
wife.
there
was
no
--
neither
the
defendant
nor
his
counsel
made
any
argument
or
suggestion
or
--
of
any
mitigating
factors
at
all.
he
allowed
them
to
say
what
they
wanted,
and
they
were
just
interested
--
i
have
the
view
point
from
this
record
that
they
expected
the
mandatory
25-year
sentence
and
they
cited
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
it
seem
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
i
think
that
the
whole
thing
boils
down
to
what
is
only
six
minutes
is
because
you
know
that
the
congress
hasn't
given
the
federal
judge
any
choice
in
this
case.
if
the
federal
judge
had
a
choice,
“should
i
give
him
5
years,
10
years,
15
years,
20
years,
or
25
years?,”
that
would
be
a
different
situation,
but
that's
not
this
case.
in
this
case,
the
jud
--
congress
has
said
“you
have
to
impose
a
25-year
penalty.”
from
the
evidence
in
this
case,
i
submit,
that
this
--
the
judge
wouldn't
--
would've
ruled
out
probation
just
from
the
evidence
in
this
case.
so,
this--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
in
this
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
he
did
pay
some
attention
to
it,
but
i
think
he
paid
the
attention
to
that
all
this
report
--
all
he
had
to
do,
all
this
report
--
this
case
required
is
not
--
if
i
would
agree
with
your
honor
that
if
he
had
a
situation
where
he
could
tailor
the
sentence
to
fix
--
to
fit
the
individual,
yes,
i
say
maybe
he
should
spend
more
time.
but,
this
is
a
case
where
he
doesn't
have
that
option.
he
only
had
to
decide
is
“whether
i
should
put
this
man
on
probation.”
and
i
think
it's
clear
from
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
from
the
defendant's
past
record
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
record
in
this
case
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
show
when
the
probation
report
was
giv
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
court
has
assumed
that
there's
six
minutes
on
the
basis
of
the
jury
returning
--
from
the
government's
brief
that
says
the
jury
returned
its
verdict
at
3:24
and
then,
that
the
sentencing
procedure
occurred
and
was
concluded
at
3:30.
it's
in
the
transcript.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
it's
that
where
there's
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
before
the
trial
commenced.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
understand
that
the
practice
in
this
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
right.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
the
record
here
does
show
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
excuse
me,
your
honor.
if
i
did,
i
made
a
mistake.
it's
true,
not
mr.
justice
brennan
is
correct.
the
trial
was
on
may
31.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
this
record
does
not
reflect
when
the
probation
officer
submitted
the
report
to
the
judge.
i
understand
it's
the
practice
in
this
district
for
the
probation
officer
to
remain
in
the
courtroom
while
the
jury
is
out
and
then
when
the
jury
reaches
its
verdict
and,
if
the
verdict
is
guilty,
at
that
time,
it's
the
common
practice
of
this
district
for
the
probation
officer
to
deliver
the
report
to
the
court.
it
also--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
record
has
no
indication
at
all.
the
record
--
that's
what--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i'm
not
--
i'm
just
--
i'm
not
asking
you.
i'm
just
saying
what
the
practice
is.
this
record
does
not
have
any
indication
as
to
when
the
probation
report
was
submitted
to
the
court,
none
whatsoever.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
my
position
is
that
whether
a
judge
has
a
probation
report
or
not
is
optional.
a
judge
that
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
correct
that
he
had
one.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
judge
have
--
the
moderate
time
a
judge
spend
on
a
probation
report
varies
with
the
individual
case.
if
he
has
a
case
of
a
first
offender
or
where
there's
a
--
where
he
has
an
option
of
putting
a
first
offender
on
probation,
i'd
say
he
should
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
the
probation
report,
perhaps
ask
the
probation
off
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
i
don't
--
i
think,
in
this
case,
where
he
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
in
this
case,
there
would
be
no
need
for
a
probation
report
because
he
did
not
have
any
option
as
to
what
sentence
to
impose.
this
is
a
clear
case
where
probation
should
have
been
denied.
i
can't
conceive
the
judge
placing
a
man
on
probation
who,
shortly
after
--
shortly
before
this
crime
was
committed,
he
had
been
released
from
a
prior
institution
and
had
violated
a
parole
previously.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
what?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well,
i
would
think
that
one
thing
he'd
be
interested
is
whether
the
probation
officer's
can
--
recommendation
agrees
with
his.
if
the
probation
officer's
recommendation
agrees
with
his
impression
of
the
case,
then
i
don't
think
he
has
to
scan
every
line
and
carefully
read
each
word.
i
think
the
judge
properly,
based
on
the
evidence
in
this
case
and
the
--
just
what
he
read
in
open
court
about
defendant's
past
history,
that
was
enough.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
well
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
don't
see
any
virtue
of
delaying
the
sentencing
process.
if
--
once
--
if
the
judge
is
clear,
the
judge
is
clear
that
this
man
rob
the
postal
station
with
a
deadly
weapon
and
he's
been
out
on
bond
before,
seems
to
me
that
the
--
and
if
he
doesn't
sentence
him,
he'll
remain
out
on
bond,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
very
reasonable
for
the
judge
to
sentence
him
on
the
spot,
and
there's
no
reason
for
the
delay.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
clearly.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
would
say
not
in
this
case
for
this
reason.
where
it
apparently
appears
from
the
record,
as
it
does
in
this
case,
that
neither
defendant's
trial,
the
determination
of
his
guilt,
the
rulings
of
the
judge,
or
the
sentence
were
affected
in
any
way
by
the
judge
obtaining
the
report
prior
to
verdict
that
there's
no
reason
to
give
him
a
new
trial.
the
reason
i
say
that
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
we
--
no,
i'd
say
the
government
will
take
the
burden
of
showing
lack
of
prejudice
and
i
say,
in
this
case,
lack
of
prejudice
appears
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
an
examination
of
the
probation
report
and
the
psychiatric
report
shows
that
the
probation
report
is
derived
principally
from
the
psychiatric
report.
so,
if
the
judge,
the
judge
who
was
required
to
examine
the
psychiatric
report
prior
to
trial,
he
even
may
have
had
the
psychiatric
report
in
front
of
him
during
the
course
of
the
trial.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
we
will
accept
that.
we'll
accept
that,
but
--
we'll
accept
that
rule
that
the
government
should
have
the
burden
of
showing
lack
of
prejudice.
and,
we
say,
in
this
case,
because
of
the
psychiatric
report,
lack
of
prejudice
is
clear
beyond
any
doubt.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
the
record
doesn't
show
as
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
defendant
wasn't
denied
an
opportunity
to
receive
the
report.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
the
rule
was
changed
in
1966.
the
rule
was
changed
in
1966
which
--
and
it
provides
now,
the
court,
before
imposing
sentence,
may
disclose
to
the
defendant
or
his
counsel
all
or
part
of
the
material
contained
in
the
presentence
investigation.
and,
i
say,
if
a
defendant
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
he
didn't
ask
for
it,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
he
never
asked
the
district
judge
to
see
all
or
any
part
of
the
probation
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
it
says
“may.”
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
“may,”
right.
that's
discretionary.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
right,
and
the
reason
the
court
has
discretion
is
there
are
certain
situations
where
there
may
be
confidential
information
in
the
probation
report,
for
example
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
in
fact,
that's
been
a
great
dispute.
no.
i,
in
my
own
opinion,
in
the
absence
of
confidential
information
in
the
report
such
as
from
a
man's
employer
or
some
sort
of
informant
are
from
a
social
service
agency,
i
think
that
the
report
should
be
disclosed.
but,
the
rules
committee
didn't
go
that
far
and
they
placed
it
in
the
discretion
of
the
district
judge
and
some
judge
disclosed
it
and
others
don't.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no,
he
said
“i
would
like
to
ask
that
a
presentence
investigation
be
made.”
he
didn't
ask
to
see
the
report.
he
asked
the
court
for
--
that
the
presentence
investigation
be
made.
at
that
point,
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
it
--
to
me,
that's
the
impression
i
have
is
he
wanted
the
probation
officer
to
conduct
a
presentence
investigation.
he
didn't
ask
the
court
to
show
him
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
he
could've
said
that,
right,
and,
apparently,
it
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
apparently,
i
assume
that
he
assumed
that
he
didn't
realize
that
a
report
had
--
an
investigation
had
commenced.
the
petitioner's
appendix,
page
7,
it
clearly
shows
what
happened
here.
mr.
richards:
“your
honor,
i
would
like
to
ask
that
a
presentence
be
made
of
--"
the
court
interrupting:
“a
presentence
investigation
has
been
made
and
it
is
before
me
now
and
i
have
read
it.”
it
says
it
shows
it
direct.
he
makes
a
--
reads
briefly
from
it
in
one
continuing
sentence.
and,
in
three
paragraphs,
he
goes
ahead
and
states
briefly
what
the
presentence
report
says
in
part
and
then
says
“it
will
be
the
judgment
of
this
court
that
this
defendant
be
sentenced
to
the
mandatory
25
years
custody
to
the
martial.”
the
petitioner
was
not
given
the
right
of
allocution
after
the
petitioner
was
informed
that
a
presentence
had
been
made
or
that
the
record
was
before
the
court.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
as
i
just
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
defense
counsel
stated,
“your
honor,
i
would
like
to
ask
that
a
presentence
investigation
be
made
of
--
“he
was
interrupted
in
the
middle
of
his
motion,
his
request."
but
then,
the
court
stated
that
there
one
had
--
that
one
had
been
made
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
defendant
or
his
lawyer
wasn't
given
the
chance
to
say
anything.
the
court
said
that
there
had
been
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
he
cut
him
off.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
the
court
stated
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes,
because
he
had
stated
it
was
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
page
7
of
the
appendix.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
correct.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
when
i
find
out
that
a
presentence
investigation
had
been
made,
that
the
court
had
read
it,
and
then
the
court
pronounced
sentence.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
“custody
of
the
martial.”
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
maybe
if
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
at
this
time,
we
were
so
surprised
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
we
were
so
surprised
that
a
presentence
investigation
had
been
made
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
because
the
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
at
this
time
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
no.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
it
certainly
was
not,
except
the
defendant
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
did
i
want
to
see
the
presentence
investigation?
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
at
that
time,
no.
the
defendant
turned,
walked
away
in
the
custody
of
the
martial.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
yes.
the
defendant
--
the
marital
stepped
forward.
the
defendant
was
taken
from
the
courtroom
immediately.
then,
we
were
later
brought
back
and
he
was
advised
of
his
appellate
rights
some
minutes
later,
10-15
minutes
later,
after
i
had
left
to
get
my
car
started
from
the
parking
lot.
then,
we
were
brought
back
in
the
courtroom
and
advised
of
the
appellate
rights
that
the
petitioner
had.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
at
that
time,
i
had
nothing
to
say,
your
honor.
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
i
was
requesting
that
a
presentence
investigation
be
made.
mr.
gregg
--
this
was
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
this
was
all
about
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
correct,
and
i
was
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
that's
correct.
i
was
not
going
to
ask
that
the
report
be
destroyed
--
mr.
sidney
m.
glazer
