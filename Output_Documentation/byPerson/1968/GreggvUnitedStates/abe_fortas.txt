justice
abe
fortas
well,
that's
not
really
before
us.
i
know
you
--
as
i
recall,
your
argument
had
great
length,
but--
justice
abe
fortas
that
question
of
whether
the
presentence
investigation
may
be
made
without
petitioner's
consent
and
before
a
guilty
plea
or
a
finding
of
guilt
is
not
really
presented
by
this
case,
is
it?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
the
purpose
of
the
rule
is
to
prevent
what
the
rules
committee,
and
presumably
congress,
thought
was
prejudice,
possible
prejudice,
to
defendants.
justice
abe
fortas
if
all
of
the
stuff
that's
in
these
presentence
investigatory
report,
hearsay,
gossip,
or
whatever
is
in
there
were
scrutinized
by
the
judge
in
the
course
of
the
trial,
isn't
that
the
purpose
of
the
rule?
justice
abe
fortas
and,
when
you
say
you're
not
claiming
prejudice
to
the
defendant
you
mean
you're
not
relying
on
him,
but
fact
of
the
rule,
the
purpose
of
the
rule
is
not
just
to
say
something
for
fun
but
it's
to
safeguard,
protect,
against
what
the
draftsmen
of
the
rule
consider
the
potential
source
of
unfairness
and
danger
to
defendants.
justice
abe
fortas
this
is
in
a
--
if
the
contrary
practice
were
permitted,
it
would
be
like
tolerating
ex
parte
statements
to
the
judge
about
the
character
of
the
defendant
in
his
associates
and
whatnot,
ex
parte
statements
with
no
evidentiary
restrictions
and
with
no
opportunity
for
counsel
for
the
defendant
to
know
what's
being
said
to
the
judge
with
no
rules
against
hearsay,
gossip,
or
whatnot,
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
what
was
the
date
of
trial?
justice
abe
fortas
how
long--
justice
abe
fortas
how
long
did
the
trial
last?
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps
i
may
suggest
--
justice
abe
fortas
that's
true.
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
glazer,
i
suggest
to
you
that
the
probation
report,
in
which
i
have
just
looked,
is
dated
may
19
which
was
the
same
day
as
the
trial
was
held.
the
probation
report
is
dated
the
same
day
as
the
trial
was
held
so
that
in
any
event,
it
was
not
supplied
to
the
judge
before
the
trial.
justice
abe
fortas
but,
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
trial
had
gone
on
for
about
a
week,
he
would've
had
the
report
for
a
week.
justice
abe
fortas
but
didn't
you
tell
me
that
the
trial
was
on
may
19?
justice
abe
fortas
perhaps
it
was
my
error.
then,
the
probation
report
which
i
have
here
is
--
has
the
date
may
19.
justice
abe
fortas
it's
not
clear
what
that
signifies,
but
that
is
the
date
that
appears
on
the
probation
report.
justice
abe
fortas
“may”
doesn't
mean
“must”
as
it
choose
there,
does
it?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
and
“may”
means
“may.”
justice
abe
fortas
the
court
has
discretion.
justice
abe
fortas
now,
are
you
saying
to
me
that
all
federal
judges
disclose
presentence
investigatory
reports
except
where
the
specific
report
has
confidential
information?
justice
abe
fortas
i
hope
you
wouldn't
say
that.
justice
abe
fortas
you
think
he
should've
said
that
“if
a
presentence
investigation
report
has
been
made,
i'd
like
to
see
it,”
even
though
it's
quite
obvious
that
he
didn't

a

report

been
