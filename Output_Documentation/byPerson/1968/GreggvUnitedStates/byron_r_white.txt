justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
the
rule
says.
the
report
shall
not
be
submitted
to
the
court
unless
the
defendant
has
pleaded
guilty
or
has
been
found
guilty.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
your
argument
is
that,
in
this
instance,
it
was
clear
since
the
judge
said
he
had
it,
that,
somehow,
it
had
been
submitted
to
him
before
the
jury
returned
its
verdict.
justice
byron
r.
white
or,
if
the
rule
means
what
it
says,
then
obviously,
the
court
below
was
wrong,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wasn't
it
physically
possible
for
the
judge
to
have
read
the
--
to
have
seen
and
read
the
report
after
the
jury
came
in
and
return
its
verdict?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
long?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
jury
told?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
judge
could've
read
it
during
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
judge
could've
read
the
report
during
that
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
judge
call
the
jury
in
this
case
or
the
clerk?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no.
the
judge
himself
says,
by
the
court,
“i'll
ask
each
individual
juror
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that's
your
verdict,”
which
i
should
suppose
means
that
the
judge
himself
polled
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
that
--
then
it
could
be
a
resentence
procedure,
is
that
it,
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
he
got
was
25
--
he
got
mandatory
25
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
on
resentence,
it
might
be
that
he
get
probation
out
of
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
is
it
your
argument
that
the
purpose
of
the
--
of
this
rule
is
to
except
the
tryer
or
the
judge,
presiding
judge
with
the
jury
from
becoming
prejudice
against
the
defendant
by
reading
the
presentence
report.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
sort
of
an
error
to
the
principle?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
say
that
we
not
only
--
that
it
isn't
because
of
possible
prejudice
against
the
defendant
during
the
trial
that
you
wanted
to
try.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
just
--
justice
byron
r.
white
just
because
--
as
a
deterrent,
as
a
remedy,
as
a
remedial
matter,
you
ought
to
order
a
new
trial
--
justice
byron
r.
white
just
to
make
judges
obey
the
rules.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
suggest
there
was
any
prejudice
in
any
respect
of
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
prejudice
to
the
defendant
--
in
any
concrete
way
--
justice
byron
r.
white
of
having
the
report.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
what
would
you
say
the
prejudice
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
there
is
a
likelihood
of
prejudice
in
this
case
on
these
facts?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
competency
hearing
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
what
did
that
have
in
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
suppose
they
had
as
much
in
it
as
the
presentence
report
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me,
mr.
glazer,
may
i
ask
you
the
question
i
asked
mr.
richards.
when
did
it
take
its
--
this
rule
take
its
present
form?
justice
byron
r.
white
19
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
thinking
strictly
the
sentence
“the
report
shall
not
be
submitted
to
the
court
or
its
contents
disclosed
unless
defendant
has
pleaded
guilty
or
has
been
found
guilty.”
how
long
has
that
sentence
been
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
that
form?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
thank
you.
justice
byron

well,
what
were
you
going
to
say
that
you
didn't
get
to

no.

there

be
made,
