chief

warren
you
may.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
glazer.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
how
long
did
all
of
that
take?
how
many
minutes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
understood
from
something
in
the
brief
said
it
was
a
time
between
3:30
and
3:36.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
that's
six
minutes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
for
all
of
these
to
happen
and
for
the
judge
to
review
the
presentence
report
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
long
is
the
report?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
mean
by
such
things
that
he
could
wipe
out
the
necessity
of
seeing
the
report,
the
probation
report?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
decide
it
on
those
things
and
not
on
the
--
in
accordance
with
the
report?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but,
should
it
be
prejudiced
by
it
if
there's
anything
good
in
the
probation
report?
chief
justice
earl
warren
yes,
by
what
he
knew
before
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
you
said
he
knew
all
about
the
defendant
and,
i
suppose
you
meant
by
that,
that
he
knew
about
his
criminal
background
and
so
forth
before
it
ever
came
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
do
you
suppose
it
decided
on
that
or
is
this
probation
report
supposed
to
have
some
significance?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
he
offer
the
defendant
an
opportunity
of
allocution?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
did
the
defendant
say?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
know
but,
mr.
glazer,
do
you
believe
that
it
is
asking
too
much
of
the
trial
judge
before
he
gives
any
man,
i
don't
care
who
he
is,
any
man
25
years
of
his
life
in
the
penitentiary
that
he
do
no
more
than
poll
the
jury
ask
the
defendant
whether
he
has
anything
to
say
and
after
his
counsel
has
spoken
briefly,
then
to
say
to
a
man
whether
he
read
the
probation
officer's
report
before
the
jury
came
in
or
afterwards
that
“i
sentence
you
to
25
years”
in
six
minutes
time?
chief
justice
earl
warren
do
you
not
believe
that
a
federal
judge
should
have
more
dignity
in
his
court
and
more
respect
for
human
life
than
to
do
a
thing
of
that
kind
in
six
minutes?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
does
he
have
a
probation
report
for
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
if
he
doesn't
go
ahead
and
pay
any
attention
to
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
in
the
record?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
do
you
ask
us
to
put
it
on
that
basis
when
you
know
nothing
about
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
mr.
glazer,
let
me
ask
you
this.
assuming
that
the
court
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
judge
had
this
before
the
verdict
was
announced.
that
would
be
a
clear
violation
of
the
rule,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
right.
now,
in
those
circumstances,
would
we
--
would
this
man
be
entitled
to
any
remedy
at
all?
chief
justice
earl
warren
your
belief
is
that
even
though
the
judge
has
clearly
violated
the
rule,
that
it
is
still
incumbent
on
the
defendant
to
establish
that
he
was
prejudiced
thereby.
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
do
you
concede
then
that
in
a
situation
where
the
judge
does
violate
the
rule
that
it's
incumbent
upon
the
--
upon
the
government
to
establish
there
was
no
prejudice
to
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
could
the
defendant
show
prejudice
if
he
is
denied
an
opportunity
to
see
the
report?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
he's
always
denied
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
didn't
he
get
it
here?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
he
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought,
mr.
glazer,
that
when
petitioner's
counsel
requested
to
be
released
on
bond
for
a
short
period
so
that
he
could
visit
his
family,
and
that
was
denied,
then
petitioner's
counsel
asked
for
a
presentence
report.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
wanted
to
see
it.
chief
justice
earl
warren
maybe
the
last
paragraph
of
the
colloquy
would
clear
that
up.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
richards:
“your
honor,
i
would
like
to
ask
that
a
presentence
investigation
be
made
of
--"
and
then
the
court
interrupting,
“a
presentence
investigation
has
been
made.
it
is
before
me
now,
and
i've
read
it.
it
shows
the
juvenile
record.
it
shows
that,
in
1960,
this
defendant
stole
an
automobile
in
violation
of
the
tire
act,
was
given
indeterminate
youth
commitment
sentence,
his
was
paroled
in
1965,
he
was
returned
--
no,
he
was
paroled
in
1962,
returned
as
a
parole
violator
in
1965,
and
was
not
released
full
time
until
may
of
last
year.
i
am
also
informed
that
he
was
convicted
of
robbery
in
yuma,
arizona
and
given
from
7-10
years.
several
warrants
are
now
pending
against
him
for
robbery
of
which
he
is
charged.
it
will
be
the
judgment
of
this
court
that
this
defendant
be
sentenced
of
the
mandatory
25
years,
custody
of
the
martial.”
to
me,
that's
plain
interruption
and
a
lack
of
opportunity
for
the
counsel
even
to
answer
the
court
because
when
he
said
“custody
of
the
martial,”
it
was
all
over.
chief
justice
earl
warren
he
was
the
lawyer.
chief
justice
