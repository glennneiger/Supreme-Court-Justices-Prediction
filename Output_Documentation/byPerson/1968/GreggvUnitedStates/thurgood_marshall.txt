justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
mr.
richards,
matter
of
fact,
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
a
judge
saw
it
while
the
jury
was
out,
is
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
familiar
with
that
statement,
but
where
in
any
record
is
there
anything
showing
that
he
saw
it
while
the
jury
was
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
the
judge
say
that
“i
read
this
while
the
jury
was
out”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
anybody
see
and
read
it
while
the
judge
was
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
does
the
court
of
appeals
get
the
fact,
and
i
emphasize
“fact,”
that
the
judge
read
it
while
the
jury
was
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
where
is
the
fact?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
a
fact,
is
it?
that's
a
conclusion,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
read
it
before.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he--
when
did
he
receive
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
richards,
what
do
you
want
us
to
do,
give
him
a
new
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
new
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
did
this
affect
the
jury's
verdict?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
how
did
this
--
the
jury
didn't
see
this,
did
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
presentence
report?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
did
this
affect
the
jury's
verdict?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
are
you
arguing
to
us
that
the
judge
had
it
before
the
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
if
you
say
“yes,”
i'm
asking
you,
where
do
you
get
it
from?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
do
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
the
judge,
according
to
you,
violated
the
rule.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
man
is
entitled
to
a
whole
brand
new
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
can
still
be
tried
on
the
same
indictment,
i
hope.
justice
thurgood
marshall
thank
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
we
could
put
him
on
probation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
have
a
right
to
look
at
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you're
not
raising
that
point,
too,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
certain
that
the
guard
--
the
judge
could
have
looked
at
this
probation
report
during
that
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
may
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
get
so
certain.
how
long
was
the
probation
report?
justice
thurgood
marshall
four
pages
long
and
the
whole
thing
took
six
minutes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
that
would
be
about,
what?
it
might
take
six
minutes
to
read
four
pages.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
he
said
“i
have
read
it.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
means,
“i
have
read
it
within
the
six-minute
period.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
according
to
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
there
anything
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
the
judge
has
taken
speed-reading?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point
is
that,
seriously,
it
appears
to
me
that
in
the
six-minute
period
he
should've
been
listening
to
what
defense
counsel
was
arguing
in
the
--
for
his
client.
he
should've
been
listening
to
what
the
plain
--
what
the
defendant
said.
and
yet,
he
used
six
minutes
in
reading
this
four
paged
document.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
also
read
that
his
wife
was
pregnant
and
other
things.
there
were
little
other
items
in
there
which
a
judge
should
listen
to.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
mr.
glazer
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
you
agree
that
not
only
is
the
rule
that
it
shouldn't
be
given
to
the
judge
until
after
the
guilt
has
been
determined,
but
also
didn't
it
assume
that
the
judge
is
going
to
read
it,
number
one,
two,
give
it
this
careful
consideration,
and,
three,
to
take
mature
time
to
think
it
over,
even
if
the
record
shows
the
man
is
guilty
as
all,
get
out?
isn't
that
why
we
have
a
probation
report?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
is
it
your
position
that
the
judge
is
given
a
probation
report
and
he
just
scans
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
which
is
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
--
in
my
case,
i'm
talking
about
where
a
judge
gets
a
probation
report.
there's
no
question
in
there
that
he
had
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
--
do
you
agree
with
me
that
he
should've
considered
it,
thought
it
over
after
having
carefully
read
it?
and,
before
you
said
he
carefully
read
it,
i
assume
that
would
take
more
than
six
minutes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
he
has
a
crime
where
all
the
witnesses
are
on
one
side
and
he
doesn't
take
the
stand,
i
gather
you
don't
think
there's
a
need
for
probation
to
put
it
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn't
need
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
did
he
read
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
he
read
it?
if
he
didn't
need
to
read
it,
why
did
he
waste
his
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
had
to
do
it
that
day,
he
couldn't
have
thought
it
over
that
night
and
sentence
him
the
next
day,
could
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
got
to
be
certain
it's
that
day
within
six
minutes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
exactly
in
here,
he
first
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
he
first
asked
you
what
did
you
have
to
say.
“now,
does
a
defendant
or
his
counsel
have
anything
that
they
wish
to
say
before
sentence
is
imposed?”
on
page
6.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
did
speak.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
the
court
turned
to
mr.
gregg,
and
mr.
gregg
spoke.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
where
were
you
cut
off?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
--
i
don't
see
where
you
were
cut
off.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
cut
you
off.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
mr.
richards,
matter
of
fact,
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
a
judge
saw
it
while
the
jury
was
out,
is
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
familiar
with
that
statement,
but
where
in
any
record
is
there
anything
showing
that
he
saw
it
while
the
jury
was
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
did
the
judge
say
that
“i
read
this
while
the
jury
was
out”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
anybody
see
and
read
it
while
the
judge
was
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
does
the
court
of
appeals
get
the
fact,
and
i
emphasize
“fact,”
that
the
judge
read
it
while
the
jury
was
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
where
is
the
fact?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
a
fact,
is
it?
that's
a
conclusion,
isn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
he
read
it
before.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he--
when
did
he
receive
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
richards,
what
do
you
want
us
to
do,
give
him
a
new
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
new
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
did
this
affect
the
jury's
verdict?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
how
did
this
--
the
jury
didn't
see
this,
did
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
presentence
report?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
did
this
affect
the
jury's
verdict?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
are
you
arguing
to
us
that
the
judge
had
it
before
the
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and,
if
you
say
“yes,”
i'm
asking
you,
where
do
you
get
it
from?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
do
you
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
the
judge,
according
to
you,
violated
the
rule.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
man
is
entitled
to
a
whole
brand
new
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
can
still
be
tried
on
the
same
indictment,
i
hope.
justice
thurgood
marshall
thank
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
we
could
put
him
on
probation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
have
a
right
to
look
at
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you're
not
raising
that
point,
too,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
certain
that
the
guard
--
the
judge
could
have
looked
at
this
probation
report
during
that
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
may
i
ask
you
one
question
before
you
get
so
certain.
how
long
was
the
probation
report?
justice
thurgood
marshall
four
pages
long
and
the
whole
thing
took
six
minutes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
that
would
be
about,
what?
it
might
take
six
minutes
to
read
four
pages.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
he
said
“i
have
read
it.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
means,
“i
have
read
it
within
the
six-minute
period.”
justice
thurgood
marshall
according
to
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
that
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
there
anything
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
the
judge
has
taken
speed-reading?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my

is
that,

and
yet,
he
used
six
minutes
in
reading
this
four
paged

justice
thurgood
marshall
i
also
read
that
his
wife
was
pregnant
and
other
things.
there
were
little
other
items
in
there
which
a
judge
should
listen
to.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
mr.
glazer
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
you
agree
that
not
only
is
the
rule
that
it
shouldn't
be
given
to
the
judge
until
after
the
guilt
has
been
determined,
but
also
didn't
it
assume
that
the

is
going
to

number

give

and,

to

even
if
the

as

get
out?
isn't
that
why
we
have
a
probation
report?
justice
thurgood

or
is
it
your
position
that
the
judge
is
given
a
probation
report
and
he
just
scans
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
which
is
your
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
--
in
my
case,
i'm
talking
about
where
a
judge
gets
a
probation
report.
there's
no
question
in
there
that
he
had
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
--
do
you
agree
with
me
that
he
should've
considered
it,
thought
it
over
after
having
carefully
read
it?
and,
before
you
said
he
carefully
read
it,
i
assume
that
would
take
more
than
six
minutes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
he
has
a
crime
where
all
the
witnesses
are
on
one
side
and
he
doesn't
take
the
stand,
i
gather
you
don't
think
there's
a
need
for
probation
to
put
it
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn't
need
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
did
he
read
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
he
read
it?
if
he
didn't
need
to
read
it,
why
did
he
waste
his
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
had
to
do
it
that
day,
he
couldn't
have
thought
it
over
that
night
and
sentence
him
the
next
day,
could
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
got
to
be
certain
it's
that
day
within
six
minutes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
where
exactly
in
here,
he
first
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
he
first
asked
you
what
did
you
have
to
say.
“now,
does
a
defendant
or
his
counsel
have
anything
that
they
wish
to
say
before
sentence
is
imposed?”
on
page

justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
did
speak.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
the
court
turned
to
mr.
gregg,
and
mr.
gregg
spoke.
justice
thurgood
marshall
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
where
were
you
cut
off?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
--
i
don't
see
where
you
were
cut
off.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
cut
you
off.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
see.
