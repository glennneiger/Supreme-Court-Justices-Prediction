why
do
you
say
you
couldn't
have
read
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
have
been
a
page
actually.
justice
hugo
l.
black
he
read
it
before
his
eyes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose,
in
this
case,
it
was
shown
that
the
pretrial
investigations
and
mental
capacity
showed
every
fact
from
the
beginning
to
the
end,
in
every
word,
in
the
same
length
that
was
shown
in
the
presentence
report.
would
you
still
say
that
your
case
should
be
reversed?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know
you
don't,
but
you
were
saying
it
should
be
automatically
reversed.
always,
that's
a
rigid
rule,
but
you
would
say
that
if
he'd
already
been
--
read
it
all
in
a
proper
report,
probably
before
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
maybe
the
rules
don't
have
a
right
to
appeal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
know,
but
you
say
prejudice
to
the
federal
rules.
justice
hugo
l.
black
prejudice
done
to
the
federal
rules,
that's
the
appeal.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
thought
it
was
the
appeal
of
the
defendant.
justice
hugo
l.
black
even
though
it
didn't
have
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
if
you
assume
it
didn't
hear
him,
you
say
he's
entitled
to
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
to
vindicate
the
rules.
justice
hugo
l.
black
was
that
all
of
the
evidence
offered
when
he
decide?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
this
six
minutes
that
you're
talking
about
begin
from
the
time
the
probation
report
was
given
to
the
judge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
was
it
given
to
the
judge?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
where
do
you
get
the
six
minutes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
might
be
possible
that
the
judge
had
it
while
the
party
will
argue
the
case
and
what
of
it
is
in
the
argument.
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
would
be
a
lot
more
than
six
minutes.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
trial
wouldn't
have
gone
on
for
a
week
because
it
didn't
have
enough
witnesses.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
only
had
the
witnesses
who
swore
that
he
committed
the
bank
robbery.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
also,
does
the
record
show
that
he
was
prejudice,
the
judge
was
prejudice?
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
any
indication
that
he
was
prejudice?
justice

is
there
anything
in

justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
anything
in
the
rule,
written
in
the
rule,
that
congress
consider
to
have
growing
effect
which
says
or
indicates
to
anybody
that
a
failure
to
read

to
follow
that

must
always
result
automatically
in
reversing
the
a
case
of
a
man
where
all
the
evidence
that
was
offered
shows
he's
guilty?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
where
were
the
defendant
and
his
lawyer
at
the
time
the
judge
told
them
there
had
been
mandate
and
he
read
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
where
were
the
defendant
and
his
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
that
answered
that
part
of
his
statement.
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
what
did
the
defendant
or
his
lawyer
say?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
he
cut
him
off?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
couldn't
talk?
justice
hugo

black
were
they
standing
there
before
him?
justice

were
you
his
lawyer?
justice
hugo
l.
black
were
you
cut
off
in
talk?
justice

you
mean
that
if
you
--
if
you
were
to
add
more
to
read
that

wanted
to
see
that
thing,
you
wouldn't
have
asked
him?

well,
why
wouldn't
you?
would
you
let
him
cut
you
off
that
quickly?
justice

well,
that's
right,

did
you
ask
him
to
see

why
didn't
you
ask

do
you
believe
that
a

who
represents
his
client
from

could
be

from

yes.
