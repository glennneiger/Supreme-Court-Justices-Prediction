mr.
dean
e.
richards
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
dean
richards
in
indianapolis,
indiana.
because
the
facts
of
this
case
can
be
summarized
easily,
i
will
begin
with
a
brief
summary.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
a
crime
in
the
western
district
of
kentucky
federal
court.
immediately
after
the
jury
returned
its
verdict
without
pause
or
recess,
the
court
ordered
the
petitioner
before
the
bench
to
take
--
the
court
asked
if
the
petitioner
had
any
res
--
comment
to
make
and,
after
a
brief
response,
the
petitioner
had
been
quiet.
at
this
time,
the
court
started
to
make
final
disposition
of
the
case
and,
at
this
time,
defense
counsel
asked
that
a
presentence
investigation
be
made.
the
court,
interrupting
counsel,
stated
that
a
presentence
investigation
had
been
made.
it
was
before
him
and
he
had
read
it.
and
then,
the
court
pronounced
sentence.
this
was
complained
of
in
a
direct
appeal
to
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
findings
and
holdings
in
the
sixth
circuit
were
that
there
was
no
basis
for
inferring
prejudice
from
the
facts
that
the
district
judge
had
seen
the
presentence
investigation
report
prior
to
the
time
when
the
jury
returned
its
verdict,
and
the
district
judge
sentenced
the
defendant
immediately
thereafter.
upon
--
counsel,
upon
noting
that
in
a
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
case,
collin
versus
united
states,
and
a
summary
case,
in
fact,
the
court
held
just
the
opposite,
in
that,
in
the
seventh
circuit
case,
the
court
stated
that
the
facts
in
the
record
before
us
effectively
rebut
the
presumption
of
prejudice
from
an
apparent
violation
of
rule
32
(c)
(1).
mr.
dean
e.
richards
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
a
set
of
facts
presented
in
the
record
to
them.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
stated
that
there
is
nothing
to
--
no
basis
for
inferring
prejudice
from
the
facts
that
the
district
judge
had
seen
the
presentence
investigation.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
the
jury
returned
its
verdict.
the
defendant
was
in
the
courtroom.
the
court--
the
trial
judge
was
on
the
bench.
the
petitioner
was
asked
to
come
immediately
before
the
bench.
there
was
no
pause
and
no
recess.
the
defendant
was
asked
if
he
had
any
response.
he
made
a
response,
and
then
the
judge
started
to
dispose
of
the
case.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
no,
the
judge--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
did
anyone?
mr.
dean
e.
richards
there
is
no
record
on
this.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
because
when
the--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
the
fact
would
be
the
time
element.
when
would
the
judge
have
had
time
to
have
read
it?
mr.
dean
e.
richards
a
conclusion,
but
when
the--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
well,
the
question
here
is
not
whether
he
had
read
it
or
whether
he
had
seen
it,
but
whether
the
judge
was
in
receipt
of
the
presentence
investigation.
the
rules--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
it
would
be
our
conclusion
that
he'd
have
to
receive
it
and
be
in
receipt
of
the
presentence
investigation
before
the
jury
returned
its
verdict.
now,
upon
noting
this
conflict
between
the
seventh
circuit
that
there
is
a
presumption
of
prejudice
where
there
is
a
violation
of
rule
32
(1)--
32
(c)
(1)
by
premature
reading
of
a
presentence
report
and
the
sixth
circuit
holding
saying
that
there
is
no
significance
in
a
trial
judge
reading
of
a
presentence
investigation
prematurely
unless,
also,
it
was
in
the
record
showing
some
violation
that
was
actually
harmful
to
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
then
filed
application
for
writ
of
certiorari
noting
the
points,
one,
that
there
was
a
conflict
between
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit,
two,
that
why
this
court
should
not
exercise
its
supervisory
powers
over
the
federal
system
of
criminal
justice
to
invoke
rule
32
(c)
(1),
and
also
to
prohibit
further
the
taking
of
presentence
investigations
before
a
determination
of
guilt
has
been
made
by
a
defendant
or
the
defendant
has
plead
guilty
in
the
absence
of
an
intelligent
conc
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
right.
that
he
was
in
receipt
of
the
rep
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
there
was
an
apparent
violation.
now,
the
--
stated
exactly
what
position
we
have
and
in
view
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
state
very
briefly
what
this
appeal
is
not.
in
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
no
constitutional
provisions
were
invoked.
no
mention
was
ever
made
of
the
united
states
constitution.
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
however,
a
very
substantial
effort
was
made
to
characterize
our
case
as
a
due
process
case
and
then
argue
it
on
the
harmless
error
versus
prejudicial
error
from
a
substitute
standpoint.
and,
in
our
brief
on
its
merits,
no
constitutional
provisions
were
invoked,
nor
was
the
united
states
constitution
mentioned.
likewise,
it
should
be
noted
that,
in
the
granting
of
the
writ
of
certiorari,
no
constitutional
provisions
were
mentioned.
the
solicitor
general's
brief
has
made
much
of
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
has
not
demonstrated
actual
prejudice
to
himself
resulting
from
this
apparent
violation
of
rule
32
(c)
(1).
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
the
sixth
circuit
places
upon
the
petitioner,
and
almost
irrebuttable,
presumption
of
non-prejudice
when
a
trial
judge
reads
--
prematurely
reads
a
presentence
investigation.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
well,
our
feeling
that
why
a
--
it
should
not
be
submitted
to
the
court
would
be
possible
prejudice
to
the
defendant
and
i
also,
along
with
this,
i
argue
that
the
rule
also
states
that
a
presentence
investigation
should
not
be
bait
before
a
conviction
or
a
plea
of
guilty
unless
there's
intelligent
consent.
a
presentence
investigation
can
be
very
harm
--
very
helpful
to
the
defendant
in
granting
probation
if
he
is
convicted.
now,
in
the
present
case,
there
was
no
consent
by
gregg.
he
did
not
know
a
presentence
investigation
had
been
made
of
him.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
that
this
was
--
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
granted
upon
facts
concerning
rule
32
(c)
(1)
and,
because
it
manifests
social
importance,
i
did
add
it
in
my
brief.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
the
prejudice
that
we're
speaking
of
here
is
not
prejudice
to
the
defendant's
substantial
or
substantive
rights.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
well,
the--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
because
--
we
have
mentioned
it
in
our
case
because
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
in
response
to
our
brief,
has
made--
as
trying
to
make
a
question
of
this,
is
why
i
am
mentioning
it
before
the
court
now.
we're
arguing
prejudice
to
the
federal
rules.
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
are
the
mandatory
or
their
advisory.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
i
feel
that
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
they
did
not.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
they
did
not,
but
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
because
it
could
have
affected
the
trial
court's
handling
of
the
trial.
i
feel
that
it
was
there
but,
from
the
record,
i
cannot
make
a
due
process
contention.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
i'm
arguing
that
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
i
do
not
know
when
the
judge
had
it
before
the
trial.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
the
judge
admitted,
after
the
verdict
was
returned,
that
he
had
it
in
his
possession
and
he'd
already
read
it.
the
presentence
invest
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes,
as
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
the
rules,
if
they
are
advisory,
then
the
defendant
gregg
have
no
standing.
if
they
are
mandatory,
then
certain
rules
based
upon
constitutional
considerations
can
be,
in
due
course,
enforced
by
due
process
considerations.
but,
the
rest
of
the
rules,
how
can
they
be
enforced?
they
can
only
be
enforced
by
this
court
using
its
supervisory
powers
on
the
strict
enforcement
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
we
are
contending
no.
the
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
the
presentence
investigation
is
generally
a
lengthy
document.
the
jury
re
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
i
have
not
seen
the
presentence
investigation
and
that
there
has
not
been
a
court
order
to
let
counsel
read
these
presentence
investigation.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
because
the
jury
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
well,
this
is
very
possible
but
the
jury,
with
the
petitioner
in
the
room,
the
trial
judge
in
the
room,
the
jury
walked
back
into
the
courthouse
--
courtroom
and
then
it
returned
its
verdict
at
this
time.
then,
the
trial
judge
asked
the
defendant
to
approach
the
bench
and
asked
if
he
had
a
response.
then,
he
made
a
response.
then,
the
judge
started
to
pronounce
sentence,
and
then
the
defense
counsel
asked
that
a
presentence
investigation
be
made.
then,
the
trial
judge
stated,
“a
presentence
investigation
has
been
made.
i
have
read
it
and
it's
before
me
now.”
then,
he
read
from
a
small
portion
of
the
presentence
investigation.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes,
it
was
there
on
the
bench
at
this
time.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
at
this
time,
when
the
jury
--
when
i
said
the
jury
returned
to
the
court
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
your
honor?
mr.
dean
e.
richards
the
jury,
during
this
--
the
judge,
at
this
time,
was
polling
the
jury.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
and,
when
the
jury
was
polled,
then
there
was
a
comment
concerning
when
that
they
were
to
return
to
further
jury
duty
and,
without
pause
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
the
clerk
--
the
judge,
i
believe,
asked
counsel
if
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
and
then,
without
pause,
without
recess,
the
defendant
was
called
before
the
bench.
this
is
when
the
petitioner
found
that
a
presentence
investigation
had
been
made
without
the
petitioner's
consent
and
the
petitioner
was
asked
to
respond
if
he
had
anything
to
say
for
himself,
not
knowing
that
a
presentence
investigation
had
been
made.
in
smith
versus
united
states,
justice
cark,
in
two
concurring
opinion
--
two
concurring
justices,
in
a
separate
opinion
in
that
case,
said
that
there
is
a
presumption
of
prejudice
when
there
is
an
apparent
violation
of
rule
32
(c)
(1),
and
he
further
--
a
judge
--
justice
clark
made
it
clear
that
the
presumption
of
prejudice
that
he
wrote
was
reached
without
due
process
considerations.
his
considerations
were
strictly
procedural
and
that
the
court,
through
its
powers
of
supervision
over
the
exercise
of
power
to
supervisions
over
the
federal
system
of
criminal
justice,
should
grant
a
new
trial
on
this
matter.
now,
the
question
before
us
is
whether
the
conduct
of
the
trial
judge
and
of
the
conduct
of
the
probation
officer,
in
this
case,
constitutes
such
a
procedural,
not
constitutional
but
a
procedural,
irregularity
as
to
require
an
exercise
of
supervisory
powers
of
this
court.
how
are
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
going
to
be
enforced
if
the
defendant
does
not
enforce
them?
the
government
certainly
will
not.
the
rules
will
not
be
enforced
unless
you
would
give
him
some
type
of
a
bounty
to
enforce
the
rules,
give
him
a
new
trial.
if
he
is
not
given
a
new
trial,
then
why
would
a
petitioner
ever
want
to
seek
his
appellate
relief
if
there's
a
violation
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure?
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes,
but
in
the
case
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
if
this
case
is
remanded
back
for
resentencing,
then
we
still
have
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
he
has
an
alternative
decision,
probation
or
a
mandatory
25-year
sentence
with
no
possibility
of
parole.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
no.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
it
could
be,
but
the
effect
was
just
now.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
the
district
judge
has
read
the
presentence
investigation
with
--
had
a
presentence
investigation
was
made
without
even
an
interview
made
of
the
defendant.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
we're
speaking
--
the
petitioner
is
speaking
of
prejudice
to
the
federal
rules.
either
they're
advisory
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct,
procedural
irregularities,
either
they're
advisory
or
they're
mandatory.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
no.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
based
--
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
that
is
our
contention.
we
are
--
we
do
not
have
a
due
process
contention
before
this
court.
we're
asking
the
court
to
exercise
supervisory
powers
and
enforce
the
federal
rules
of
procedure.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
i
feel
that
there's
prejudice.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes,
i
feel
that
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
i
have
not
looked
at
the
report.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
i
understand
that
there
is
not
--
there
has
been
a
report.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
no.
i'm
--
if
any
prejudice
--
now,
i'm
not
stating
that
there
is
prejudice
to
the
defendant
and
if
there
is
prejudice
there
is
not
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
i
feel
that
there
is
prejudice.
i
feel
that
there
is
prejudice
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
well,
the
prejudice
would
be,
from
the
record,
such
as
the
court's
not
letting
the
defendant
have
an
instruction
on
lesser
included
defense,
the
undue
haste,
in
which
this
trial
was
given
or
was
directed
through,
not
allowing
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
no.
a
presentence
--
a
pre-mental
examination
was
made
of
the
defendant
to
determine
whether
he
was
competent
to
stand
trial
and
that
report
was
submitted
to
the
court.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
what
did
that
have
in
it?
mr.
dean
e.
richards
it
had
the
defendant's
--
part
of
the
defendant's
past
criminal
background.
it
had
his
education,
his
mental
problems,
his
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
it
could
have,
but
i
presume
that
the
pre-mental
examination
report
would
be
only
used
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
the
petitioner
was
competent
to
stand
trial,
not
to
be
used
to
determine
whether
the
petitioner
should
be
given
probation
or
should
be
given
a
25-year
mandatory
sentence.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes,
it
was.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that
was
in
the
competency
report,
yes.
that
was
submitted
to
the
court.
we're
stating
that
there
is
prejudice
to
the
rules.
that
who
is
going
to
enforce
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure?
why
would
a
defendant
seek
his
appellate
remedies
unless
he
can
get
a
new
trial
if
a
federal
rule
is
violated
during
the
course
of
his
trial
or
if
he
would
only
be
given
a
resentencing?
we
argue
that
the
federal
rules
should
be
made

and,
if
there
is
a
violation
such
as
a
violation
of
rule
32
(c)
(1),
that
the
defendant
should
be
given
a
new
trial.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
i
do
not
know
what
was
at
the
presentence
investigation.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes,
because
our
appeal
is
based
upon
prejudice
not
to
the
defendant,
but
prejudice
to
the
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedures.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
but,
defendants
do
and
the
only
way
that
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
the
appeal.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct,
but
the
defendant
has
asked
in
this
court
for
a
strict
enforcement
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedures.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
we,
it
is
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
we
do
not
have
a
due
process
contention.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
your
honor?
the
issue
here
is
not
a
due
process,
but
whether
this
court
should
invoke
its
supervisory
powers
over
the
federal
rules
and
make
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
mandatory.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
rule
32
(c)
(1)
says
the
presentence
report
shall
not
be
presented
to
the
court.
the
sixth
circuit
finding
stated
that
even
if
the
trial
court
did
receive
the
port
--
re
--
presentence
report
prematurely
and
read
it
prematurely
or
was
in
receipt
of
it
prematurely
then,
still,
this
is
no
basis
for
inferring
prejudice.
the
smith
case
stated
that
it
was
presumptively
prejudicial,
and
justice
clark
put
it
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that
is
correct.
that
is
exactly
--
now,
in
the
closing
paragraph
of
the
government's
brief
they
stated
that
petitioner
herein,
in
one
breath,
wants
the
recognition
of
a
previously
unrecognized
right
and
the
enforcement
of
that
right
on
a
sweeping
scale.
now,
in
our
closing
statement,
i
would
like
to
say
that
this
case
may
or
may
not
have
forereaching
implications,
but
the
--
to
the
petitioner,
the
implications
are
very
singular
and
very
unique.
all
that
the
petitioner
here
wants
is
a
new
trial.
in
view
of
this
manifest
violation
of
rule
32
(c)
(1)
as
applied
to
the
petitioner
herein,
the
petitioner
does
not
feel
that
he
is
asking
too
much
of
this
court.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
i
do
not
know
the
--
july
of
1966.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
i
believe
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
i
believe
so.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
thank
you.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
dean
richards
in
indianapolis,
indiana.
because
the
facts
of
this
case
can
be
summarized
easily,
i
will
begin
with
a
brief
summary.
the
petitioner
was
convicted
of
a
crime
in
the
western
district
of
kentucky
federal
court.
immediately
after
the
jury
returned
its
verdict
without
pause
or
recess,
the
court
ordered
the
petitioner
before
the
bench
to
take
--
the
court
asked
if
the
petitioner
had
any
res
--
comment
to
make
and,
after
a
brief
response,
the
petitioner
had
been
quiet.
at
this
time,
the
court
started
to
make
final
disposition
of
the
case
and,
at
this
time,
defense
counsel
asked
that
a
presentence
investigation
be
made.
the
court,
interrupting
counsel,
stated
that
a
presentence
investigation
had
been
made.
it
was
before
him
and
he
had
read
it.
and
then,
the
court
pronounced
sentence.
this
was
complained
of
in
a
direct
appeal
to
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
findings
and
holdings
in
the
sixth
circuit
were
that
there
was
no
basis
for
inferring
prejudice
from
the
facts
that
the
district
judge
had
seen
the
presentence
investigation
report
prior
to
the
time
when
the
jury
returned
its
verdict,
and
the
district
judge
sentenced
the
defendant
immediately
thereafter.
upon
--
counsel,
upon
noting
that
in
a
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
case,
collin
versus
united
states,
and
a
summary
case,
in
fact,
the
court
held
just
the
opposite,
in
that,
in
the
seventh
circuit
case,
the
court
stated
that
the
facts
in
the
record
before
us
effectively
rebut
the
presumption
of
prejudice
from
an
apparent
violation
of
rule
32
(c)
(1).
mr.
dean
e.
richards
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
had
a
set
of
facts
presented
in
the
record
to
them.
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals
stated
that
there
is
nothing
to
--
no
basis
for
inferring
prejudice
from
the
facts
that
the
district
judge
had
seen
the
presentence
investigation.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
the
jury
returned
its
verdict.
the
defendant
was
in
the
courtroom.
the
court--
the
trial
judge
was
on
the
bench.
the
petitioner
was
asked
to
come
immediately
before
the
bench.
there
was
no
pause
and
no
recess.
the
defendant
was
asked
if
he
had
any
response.
he
made
a
response,
and
then
the
judge
started
to
dispose
of
the
case.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
no,
the
judge--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
did
anyone?
mr.
dean
e.
richards
there
is
no
record
on
this.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
because
when
the--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
the
fact
would
be
the
time
element.
when
would
the
judge
have
had
time
to
have
read
it?
mr.
dean
e.
richards
a
conclusion,
but
when
the--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
well,
the
question
here
is
not
whether
he
had
read
it
or
whether
he
had
seen
it,
but
whether
the
judge
was
in
receipt
of
the
presentence
investigation.
the
rules--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
it
would
be
our
conclusion
that
he'd
have
to
receive
it
and
be
in
receipt
of
the
presentence
investigation
before
the
jury
returned
its
verdict.
now,
upon
noting
this
conflict
between
the
seventh
circuit
that
there
is
a
presumption
of
prejudice
where
there
is
a
violation
of
rule
32
(1)--
32
(c)
(1)
by
premature
reading
of
a
presentence
report
and
the
sixth
circuit
holding
saying
that
there
is
no
significance
in
a
trial
judge
reading
of
a
presentence
investigation
prematurely
unless,
also,
it
was
in
the
record
showing
some
violation
that
was
actually
harmful
to
the
defendant,
the
petitioner
then
filed
application
for
writ
of
certiorari
noting
the
points,
one,
that
there
was
a
conflict
between
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
sixth
circuit,
two,
that
why
this
court
should
not
exercise
its
supervisory
powers
over
the
federal
system
of
criminal
justice
to
invoke
rule
32
(c)
(1),
and
also
to
prohibit
further
the
taking
of
presentence
investigations
before
a
determination
of
guilt
has
been
made
by
a
defendant
or
the
defendant
has
plead
guilty
in
the
absence
of
an
intelligent
conc
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
right.
that
he
was
in
receipt
of
the
rep
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
there
was
an
apparent
violation.
now,
the
--
stated
exactly
what
position
we
have
and
in
view
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
state
very
briefly
what
this
appeal
is
not.
in
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
no
constitutional
provisions
were
invoked.
no
mention
was
ever
made
of
the
united
states
constitution.
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
however,
a
very
substantial
effort
was
made
to
characterize
our
case
as
a
due
process
case
and
then
argue
it
on
the
harmless
error
versus
prejudicial
error
from
a
substitute
standpoint.
and,
in
our
brief
on
its
merits,
no
constitutional
provisions
were
invoked,
nor
was
the
united
states
constitution
mentioned.
likewise,
it
should
be
noted
that,
in
the
granting
of
the
writ
of
certiorari,
no
constitutional
provisions
were
mentioned.
the
solicitor
general's
brief
has
made
much
of
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
has
not
demonstrated
actual
prejudice
to
himself
resulting
from
this
apparent
violation
of
rule
32
(c)
(1).
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
the
sixth
circuit
places
upon
the
petitioner,
and
almost
irrebuttable,
presumption
of
non-prejudice
when
a
trial
judge
reads
--
prematurely
reads
a
presentence
investigation.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
well,
our
feeling
that
why
a
--
it
should
not
be
submitted
to
the
court
would
be
possible
prejudice
to
the
defendant
and
i
also,
along
with
this,
i
argue
that
the
rule
also
states
that
a
presentence
investigation
should
not
be
bait
before
a
conviction
or
a
plea
of
guilty
unless
there's
intelligent
consent.
a
presentence
investigation
can
be
very
harm
--
very
helpful
to
the
defendant
in
granting
probation
if
he
is
convicted.
now,
in
the
present
case,
there
was
no
consent
by
gregg.
he
did
not
know
a
presentence
investigation
had
been
made
of
him.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
that
this
was
--
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
granted
upon
facts
concerning
rule
32
(c)
(1)
and,
because
it
manifests
social
importance,
i
did
add
it
in
my
brief.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
the
prejudice
that
we're
speaking
of
here
is
not
prejudice
to
the
defendant's
substantial
or
substantive
rights.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
well,
the--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
because
--
we
have
mentioned
it
in
our
case
because
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
in
response
to
our
brief,
has
made--
as
trying
to
make
a
question
of
this,
is
why
i
am
mentioning
it
before
the
court
now.
we're
arguing
prejudice
to
the
federal
rules.
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
are
the
mandatory
or
their
advisory.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
i
feel
that
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
they
did
not.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
they
did
not,
but
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
because
it
could
have
affected
the
trial
court's
handling
of
the
trial.
i
feel
that
it
was
there
but,
from
the
record,
i
cannot
make
a
due
process
contention.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
i'm
arguing
that
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
i
do
not
know
when
the
judge
had
it
before
the
trial.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
the
judge
admitted,
after
the
verdict
was
returned,
that
he
had
it
in
his
possession
and
he'd
already
read
it.
the
presentence
invest
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes,
as
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
the
rules,
if
they
are
advisory,
then
the
defendant
gregg
have
no
standing.
if
they
are
mandatory,
then
certain
rules
based
upon
constitutional
considerations
can
be,
in
due
course,
enforced
by
due
process
considerations.
but,
the
rest
of
the
rules,
how
can
they
be
enforced?
they
can
only
be
enforced
by
this
court
using
its
supervisory
powers
on
the
strict
enforcement
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
we
are
contending
no.
the
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
the
presentence
investigation
is
generally
a
lengthy
document.
the
jury
re
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
i
have
not
seen
the
presentence
investigation
and
that
there
has
not
been
a
court
order
to
let
counsel
read
these
presentence
investigation.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
because
the
jury
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
well,
this
is
very
possible
but
the
jury,
with
the
petitioner
in
the
room,
the
trial
judge
in
the
room,
the
jury
walked
back
into
the
courthouse
--
courtroom
and
then
it
returned
its
verdict
at
this
time.
then,
the
trial
judge
asked
the
defendant
to
approach
the
bench
and
asked
if
he
had
a
response.
then,
he
made
a
response.
then,
the
judge
started
to
pronounce
sentence,
and
then
the
defense
counsel
asked
that
a
presentence
investigation
be
made.
then,
the
trial
judge
stated,
“a
presentence
investigation
has
been
made.
i
have
read
it
and
it's
before
me
now.”
then,
he
read
from
a
small
portion
of
the
presentence
investigation.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes,
it
was
there
on
the
bench
at
this
time.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
at
this
time,
when
the
jury
--
when
i
said
the
jury
returned
to
the
court
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
your
honor?
mr.
dean
e.
richards
the
jury,
during
this
--
the
judge,
at
this
time,
was
polling
the
jury.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
and,
when
the
jury
was
polled,
then
there
was
a
comment
concerning
when
that
they
were
to
return
to
further
jury
duty
and,
without
pause
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
the
clerk
--
the
judge,
i
believe,
asked
counsel
if
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
and
then,
without
pause,
without
recess,
the
defendant
was
called
before
the
bench.
this
is
when
the
petitioner
found
that
a
presentence
investigation
had
been
made
without
the
petitioner's
consent
and
the
petitioner
was
asked
to
respond
if
he
had
anything
to
say
for
himself,
not
knowing
that
a
presentence
investigation
had
been
made.
in
smith
versus
united
states,
justice
cark,
in
two
concurring
opinion
--
two
concurring
justices,
in
a
separate
opinion
in
that
case,
said
that
there
is
a
presumption
of
prejudice
when
there
is
an
apparent
violation
of
rule
32
(c)
(1),
and
he
further
--
a
judge
--
justice
clark
made
it
clear
that
the
presumption
of
prejudice
that
he
wrote
was
reached
without
due
process
considerations.
his
considerations
were
strictly
procedural
and
that
the
court,
through
its
powers
of
supervision
over
the
exercise
of
power
to
supervisions
over
the
federal
system
of
criminal
justice,
should
grant
a
new
trial
on
this
matter.
now,
the
question
before
us
is
whether
the
conduct
of
the
trial
judge
and
of
the
conduct
of
the
probation
officer,
in
this
case,
constitutes
such
a
procedural,
not
constitutional
but
a
procedural,
irregularity
as
to
require
an
exercise
of
supervisory
powers
of
this
court.
how
are
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
going
to
be
enforced
if
the
defendant
does
not
enforce
them?
the
government
certainly
will
not.
the
rules
will
not
be
enforced
unless
you
would
give
him
some
type
of
a
bounty
to
enforce
the
rules,
give
him
a
new
trial.
if
he
is
not
given
a
new
trial,
then
why
would
a
petitioner
ever
want
to
seek
his
appellate
relief
if
there's
a
violation
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure?
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes,
but
in
the
case
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
if
this
case
is
remanded
back
for
resentencing,
then
we
still
have
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
he
has
an
alternative
decision,
probation
or
a
mandatory
25-year
sentence
with
no
possibility
of
parole.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
no.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
it
could
be,
but
the
effect
was
just
now.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
the
district
judge
has
read
the
presentence
investigation
with
--
had
a
presentence
investigation
was
made
without
even
an
interview
made
of
the
defendant.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
we're
speaking
--
the
petitioner
is
speaking
of
prejudice
to
the
federal
rules.
either
they're
advisory
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct,
procedural
irregularities,
either
they're
advisory
or
they're
mandatory.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
no.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
based
--
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
that
is
our
contention.
we
are
--
we
do
not
have
a
due
process
contention
before
this
court.
we're
asking
the
court
to
exercise
supervisory
powers
and
enforce
the
federal
rules
of
procedure.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
i
feel
that
there's
prejudice.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes,
i
feel
that
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
i
have
not
looked
at
the
report.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
i
understand
that
there
is
not
--
there
has
been
a
report.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
no.
i'm
--
if
any
prejudice
--
now,
i'm
not
stating
that
there
is
prejudice
to
the
defendant
and
if
there
is
prejudice
there
is
not
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
i
feel
that
there
is
prejudice.
i
feel
that
there
is
prejudice
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
well,
the
prejudice
would
be,
from
the
record,
such
as
the
court's
not
letting
the
defendant
have
an
instruction
on
lesser
included
defense,
the
undue
haste,
in
which
this
trial
was
given
or
was
directed
through,
not
allowing
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
no.
a
presentence
--
a
pre-mental
examination
was
made
of
the
defendant
to
determine
whether
he
was
competent
to
stand
trial
and
that
report
was
submitted
to
the
court.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
what
did
that
have
in
it?
mr.
dean
e.
richards
it
had
the
defendant's
--
part
of
the
defendant's
past
criminal
background.
it
had
his
education,
his
mental
problems,
his
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
it
could
have,
but
i
presume
that
the
pre-mental
examination
report
would
be
only
used
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
the
petitioner
was
competent
to
stand
trial,
not
to
be
used
to
determine
whether
the
petitioner
should
be
given
probation
or
should
be
given
a
25-year
mandatory
sentence.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes,
it
was.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that
was
in
the
competency
report,
yes.
that
was
submitted
to
the
court.
we're
stating
that
there
is
prejudice
to
the
rules.
that
who
is
going
to
enforce
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure?
why
would
a
defendant
seek
his
appellate
remedies
unless
he
can
get
a
new
trial
if
a
federal
rule
is
violated
during
the
course
of
his
trial
or
if
he
would
only
be
given
a
resentencing?
we
argue
that
the
federal
rules
should
be
made
mandatory
and,
if
there
is
a
violation
such
as
a
violation
of
rule
32
(c)
(1),
that
the
defendant
should
be
given
a
new
trial.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
i
do
not
know
what
was
at
the
presentence
investigation.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
yes,
because
our
appeal
is
based
upon
prejudice
not
to
the
defendant,
but
prejudice
to
the
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedures.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
but,
defendants
do
and
the
only
way
that
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
the
appeal.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct,
but
the
defendant
has
asked
in
this
court
for
a
strict
enforcement
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedures.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
we,
it
is
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
we
do
not
have
a
due
process
contention.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
your
honor?
the
issue
here
is
not
a
due
process,
but
whether
this
court
should
invoke
its
supervisory
powers
over
the
federal
rules
and
make
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
mandatory.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
rule
32
(c)
(1)
says
the
presentence
report
shall
not
be
presented
to
the
court.
the
sixth
circuit
finding
stated
that
even
if
the
trial
court
did
receive
the
port
--
re
--
presentence
report
prematurely
and
read
it
prematurely
or
was
in
receipt
of
it
prematurely
then,
still,
this
is
no
basis
for
inferring
prejudice.
the
smith
case
stated
that
it
was
presumptively
prejudicial,
and
justice
clark
put
it
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that
is
correct.
that
is
exactly
--
now,
in
the
closing
paragraph
of
the
government's
brief
they
stated
that
petitioner
herein,
in
one
breath,
wants
the
recognition
of
a
previously
unrecognized
right
and
the
enforcement
of
that
right
on
a
sweeping
scale.
now,
in
our
closing
statement,
i
would
like
to
say
that
this
case
may
or
may
not
have
forereaching
implications,
but
the
--
to
the
petitioner,
the
implications
are
very
singular
and
very
unique.
all
that
the
petitioner
here
wants
is
a
new
trial.
in
view
of
this
manifest
violation
of
rule
32
(c)
(1)
as
applied
to
the
petitioner
herein,
the
petitioner
does
not
feel
that
he
is
asking
too
much
of
this
court.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
i
do
not
know
the
--
july
of
1966.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
that's
correct.
i
believe
--
mr.
dean
e.
richards
i
believe
so.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
dean
e.
richards
thank
you.
