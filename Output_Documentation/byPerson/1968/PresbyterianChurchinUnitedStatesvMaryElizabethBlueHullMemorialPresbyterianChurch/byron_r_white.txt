if
you
are
going

point
specifically
where
in

there’s
any
reference
to
the
use
of
property
or
a
right
of
the

to
the

justice
byron

i
understand
that.
they
may
not
have
gone
on

i
just
like
to
know
where,
on
what
basis
within
the
church
does
the
central
church
or
general
church
have
any
claim
to
local
--
on
the
local

justice

you
mean
you
have
to
turn
the
civil

for
the
implied

justice

the

made
law
for
the

trust?
justice

did
it
say
anything
about
property?
justice

now
where
is
that?
justice

white
where
do
you
find
that
in

justice

white
you
mean
that
isn’t
in
the
printed
record
here?
justice
byron

white
you
quoted
it
on
the
brief?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
quote
is
a
rather
important
matter
as
to
what
--
after
all,
kedroff
and
kreshik
said
that
within
the
canon
law
of
the
church,
there
is
some
sort
of
basis
for
saying
that
the
elders
of
that
church,
whatever
you
or
the
bishops
or
whatever
they
were
had
the
right
to
the
use
and
occupancy
of
the
property.
now
how
about
some
similar
basis
of
the
church
law
for
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
some
place
on
the
record
that
we
can
find
this
church
order
(voice

justice
byron

white
is
it
in
the
typewritten

justice
byron

white
we
don’t
have
as
or
bs
in
this
one,
the
one
that
it’s
on
the

justice
byron

white
but
would
you
say
then
that
that
the
civil
courts
are
entitled
to
interpret
the
ecclesiastical
law
or
the
canon
law
with
respect
to
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
isn’t
–
if
you
don’t
rely
on
the
implied
trust
and
then
it
seems
to
me
the
court,
in
order
to
settle
the
property
dispute,
would
have
to
interpret
the
church
law.
and
it
can’t
do
that
either;
it
should
dismiss
the
case
and
leave
it
at
the
file
as
traits.

alright.

before
you
get
to
that,
may
i
just
ask
you
one
question.
are
you
going
to
suggest
any
way
in
which
we
can
get
out
of
this
without
having
depends
on
that
church
constitution?
justice

how
can
it
be
resolved?
it
is
still
here.

(voice

resolved
in

below.
it
appear
now.
justice
byron

white
i’m
just
asking
are
you
going
to
suggest
anyway
that
we
can
decide
this
case
without
having
to
get
into
that
church
constitution?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
wouldn't
challenge
that
implied
trust
at
all
on
any
--
on
the
first
amendment
grounds.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
the
property
would
go
to
the
mother
church.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
lets
assume
that
the
first
amendment
forbids
the
civil
courts
from
adjudicating
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
breach
trust
and
forbids
it
because
adjudicating
the
breach
requires
an
interpretation
of
church
dogma.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
that
we
held
it
though.
justice
byron
r.

then
what
would
you
say
about
the
implied
trust.
we
said

the

you
say
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
would
say
we
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
if
we
did
because
that's
the
--
the
issue
here
that's
been

is
it
the
first
amendment

question.

the

what
would

in

the

i'm

it
would

lets
just

the
court

adjudication
of

dogma
is
contrary

the
first
amendment

that
the

it
--
those
at

court's
adjudications
must
be
set
aside.
where
does
the
case
stand
there?
justice

on
what
basis
would
you

would
your
claim
then
rest?

this
would
be

secular

a
