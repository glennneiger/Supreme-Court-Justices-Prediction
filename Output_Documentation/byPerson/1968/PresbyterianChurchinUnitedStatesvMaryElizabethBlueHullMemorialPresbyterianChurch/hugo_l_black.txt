would
you
mind
--
would
you
mind
stating
to
me
first
how
was
this
trust
created?
justice
hugo
l.
black
did
anybody
signed
it
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
how
was
it
created?
justice
hugo
l.
black
now,
absent
--
the
doctrine
of
the
implied
trust,
would
this
case
get
in
to
court?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
that's
a
creation
of
the
court's
opinion,
do
you
think
in
watson?
justice
hugo
l.
black
mixes
the
court
up
considerably
in
connection
with
the
policies
of
the
church
at
one
time
and
another?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
the
factual
matter?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
it
does
that,
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
title
of
the
land
that
some
people
--?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
if
the
people
far
distant?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
goes
to
people
far
distant
from
the
church.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then,
who
would
get
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
under
the
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
that
the
unanimous,
devoted
there
against
the
interest
there?
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
he
tell
to
keep
that
property
from
their
own
use.
justice
hugo
l.
black
when
you
get
down
to
the
bottom
here,
is
there
anything
in
dispute
at
all
except
who
controls
this
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
nothing
in
the
move?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
who
could
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
and
they
claim
they
have
withdrawn
so
as
--
from
the
mother
church.
justice
hugo
l.
black
the
mother
church
--
and
their
--
and
their
big
church
wants
to
get
it
so
it
can
do
what,
to
use
the
property?
justice
hugo
l.
black
then
they'd
have
to
get
some
other
congregation
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
they'd
have
no
congregation
to
go
there.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
have
nothing
involved
on
or
dispute
except
the
control
over
this
property,
the
local
people
voluntarily.
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
have
one
and
did
not
agree
with
you.
with
you
too
on
that
issue,
about
the
trust
but
one
thought
that
a
trust
of
a
church
couldn't
be
decided
in
the
court
of
law,
to
take
away
property
from
somebody
to
whom
it
belongs
on
the
basis
of
the
church
dogma,
then
the
case
is
quite
different,
isn't
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
they're
not
attempting
to
interfere
with
this
dogma.
they
just
simply
insisting
on
taking
--
withdrawing
apartment
and
keeping
the
church.
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
may
i
ask
you
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
a
presbyterian
judge
be
disqualified
from
sitting
in
a
case
for
this
thing?
justice
hugo
l.
black
does
the
record
show,
how
much
this
land
on
which
this
church
is
located?
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
is
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
(inaudible).
can
i
ask
you
just
to
make
sure,
as
i
understand
it,
there
really
isn't
much
a
question
in
this
case
but
what
church
dogma
was
involved
and
the
disposition
o
the
case,
the
lower
court
required
interpretation
of
the
church
dogma
to
see
if
there
was
a
breach
of
trust.
justice
hugo
l.
black
yes.
now,
let's
assume
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
--
that
this
court
held
that
the
first
amendment
forbade
the
civil
courts
from
adjudicating
church
dogma
in
this
manner.
i
take
it,
if
that
were
the
rule,
you
would
--
then
--
that
you
would
say
that
the
implied
trust
imposed
by
the
secular
law
would
still
prevail.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
see
to
it,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
instead
of
being
add
out,
you
might
be
in
a
position
of
the
tennis
player
who
has
just
won
his
game.

would
you
