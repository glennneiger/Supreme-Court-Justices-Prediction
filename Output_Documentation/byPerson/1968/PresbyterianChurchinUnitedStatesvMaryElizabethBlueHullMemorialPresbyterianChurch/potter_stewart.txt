yes,
but
in
those
two
cases,
they
found
within
the
ecclesiastical
law
itself
of
the
right
to
use
and
occupy
the
property.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
ask
you
whether
we
were
concluded
by
the
holding
of
implied
trust.
you’re
answer
to
me
now
is,
“we
are
not”.
in
the
determination
here
whether
or
not
this
is
a
matter
of
church
law,
we
witness
to
this
property
any
authority
of
the
state
by
whatever
property
concept.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
to
what
justice
white
asked
you
earlier.
it
was
true,
wasn’t
it
that
we
were
able
to
find
in
kedroff
that
there
was
a
provision
of
canon
law
that
dealt
with
this
problem?
and
if
you
are
going
to
suggest
that
there
is
one
in
--
we
have
your
book
of
church
order
here
but
can
you
suggest
what
the
provision
was
now
that
you
referred
us
to
earlier?
justice
potter
stewart
but
where
does
this
civil
court
have
the
right
to
imply
trust
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
a
--
then
its
origin
is
in
the
secular
law
in
the
sense
that
the
--
either
the
legislature
or
a
court
is
said
that
in
these
circumstances,
they
trust
the
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
none
at
all.
justice
potter
stewart
so
this
is
a
doctrine
of
a
secular
law.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
do
you
say
--
apparently
you
don't
argue
that
if
the
terms
of
the
trust
which
is
imposed
by
the
secular
law
may
not
be
adjudicated
by
the
secular
courts
that
therefore
the
trust
cannot
be
observed.
