chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that,
as
you
understand,
that
is
not
the
basis
of
the
determination
of
the
reason
implied
thrust
here
or
is
a
basis
of
it?
i’m
not
suggesting
this
is
correct.
i’m
not
trying
to
disentangle
this.
there
is
a
basis
of
the
implied
trust
conclusion
of
the
following,
that
when
the
church
property
was
acquired
by
purchase
or
by
gift,
that
it
was
acquired
by
the
church’
cooperation
subject
to
the
implied
trust
just
implied
from
the
circumstances
that
it
would
be
dedicated
to
the
users
of
the
presbyterian
church
and
that
meant
the
central
authority
of
the
presbyterian
church
whether
that
implication,
and
that
that
was
the
implication
that
was
the
conclusion
where
the
implication
proceeded
from
the
circumstances
of
acquisition
or
the
church
laws
i
suppose
is
not
clear.
but
i
know
this
far
of
my
study
of
the
cases
see
nothing
that
would
indicate
that
the
implication
was
drawn
from
the
church
laws
rather
than
from
the
circumstances
of
the
acquisition.
chief
justice
earl
warren
what’s
that
mean
“politic”?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
that
the
courts
here
are
making
an
inference
from
the
implied
trust
from
the
policy
in
practice
in
the
church?
i
hope
that
--
i
trust
and
i
assume
your
argument
basically
is
this
is
something
that
we
can
leave
to
the
state
court.
state
court
has
found
an
implied
trust
and
that’s
that.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
they
don’t
question
it
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
once
you
get
beyond
that,
the
situation
gets
a
little
complicated
than
vague
to
me
in
a
way.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
in
the
holding
that’s
before
us
the
one
that
appears
on
page
124
of
the
appendix
and
the
opinion
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
it
says
that
after
saying
that
there
is
implied
trust
and
the
court
says
we
take
the
view
that
such
a
trust
is
conditioned
upon
the
general
churches
adherence
to
the
tenets
of
faith
and
practice
existing
in
the
local
church
adhered
with
it
and
that
an
abandon
may
now
over
a
departure
from
such
tenets
as
a
diversion
from
the
trust
that
civil
courts
will
prevent
and
it
goes
on
to
say
that
that
abandonment
or
departure
has
then
have
to
be
total
but
have
to
be
substantial.
is
that
the
issue
before?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
we
do
not
have
any
comments
on
these
questions?
chief
justice
earl
warren
found
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
would
be
communist,
would
it?
[laughter
attempt]
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
weights?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
will
get
us
that
citation
from
the

overnight,
will
you?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
page?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
that
works
only
if
the
church
has
been
dissolved,
they
come
to
an
end
is
that
right?
chief
justice
earl
warren
which
is
not
the
case
here.
chief
justice
earl
warren
finish
your
little
statement
and
then
--
chief
justice
earl

and
now,
we’ll
recess.

mr.
gowen,
you
may
continue
with
your
argument.
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
said
--
excuse
me,
excuse
me,
i
know
it
mr.
page,
you
had
already
started
your
argument.
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that
has
no
prohibition
against
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
see,
yes.
chief
justice
earl
warren
does
your
constitution
provide
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
where
do
you
get
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
is
that
the
only
place
you
get
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
is
this
departure
from
the
original
dogma
fall
under
that
phrase
of
fraud
or
whatever
it
was?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
just
what
are
the
--
you
were
about
to
specify
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
this
is
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
yeah,
but
what
other
specifications
of
departure
from
that?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
were
these
departures
that
you
referred
to
mandatory
and
binding
on
the
--
on
these
churches
or
were
they
statements
or
views
of
the
hierarchy
of
the
church?
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
what?
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
oh,
i
suppose
there
is
a
question
of
whether
this
is
a
departure
from
the
doctrine
of
the
church,
isn't
there?
chief
justice
earl
warren
by
whom?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
it,
i'd
like
to
asked
you
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
whether
there
was
anything
involved
in
this
case
other
than
property.
you
said
no
but
as
i
understand
it,
you
stand
on
the
premise
that
this
was
a
departure
from
the
constitution
of
the
church
and
if
the
court
shall
determine
that
it
is
a
departure
from
the
dogma
of
the
church.
chief
justice
earl
warren
that's
exactly
what
i
meant.
and
i
can't
see
whether
the
dogma
of
the
church
has
anything
to
do
with
that
issue.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
let
me
give
you
another
one
of
those
specifications
and
receive
just
where
we
stand.
the
general
assembly's
--
what
are
these
objections
they
made
to
the,
as
you
called
departure
from
dogma,
is
the
general
assembly's
failure
to
endorse
a
proposal
to
amend
the
u.s.
constitution
to
overcome
this
court's
school
prior
decisions.
response
characterize
this
is
giving
support
to
the
removal
of
bible
reading
and
prayer
in
the
public
schools,
now
what
is
there
in
the
constitution
that
says
that
the
church
as
a
whole
must
endorse
a
constitutional
amendment
to
overcome
the
decision
of
this
court?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
--
one
of
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
maybe
no
evidence
but
you
charged
that
to
this
one
other
thing
and
i
suppose
that
went
entered
the
judgment.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
know
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
is
that
a
departure?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
can't
you
answer
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
because
you
don't
want
to?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
but
you
said
--
tell
us
this
other
things
are
departures.
chief
justice
earl
warren
are
there
any
presbyterian
lawyers
here
on
each
side.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gowen.
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
about
a
pretty
good
vote?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gowen
you
were
going
to
give
us
the
citations
of
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
they
are
just
one
other
thing
that
i'd
like
to
know,
i
understood
from
your
brief
that
most
of
these
specifications
of
departure
from
a
dogma
of
the
church
were
not
binding
on
any
of
the
local
churches
except
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
i
understood
counsel
just
a
few
moments
ago
to
say
the
contrary
that
there
were
two
kinds
of
pronouncements
that
could
come
from
a
general
assembly
and
both
of
them
were
binding
on
the
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
--
on
the
church
(voice

chief
justice
earl

a
lot
of
them
do
that.
