mr.
owen
h.
page
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
can
put
this
in
a
correct
prospective
point.
at
the
time
these
churches,
the
local
churches
withdrew
in
april
1966
in
the
resolution
of
disaffiliation,
they
charged
the
denomination
or
church
with
specific
violations
of
the
church
doctrine/dogma
and
discipline.
now
in
light
of
that,
then
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
rightfully
there
being
an
--
and
mr.
justice
white,
the
only
reference
in
the
book
of
church
order
to
the
right
of
a
presbyterian
at
(inaudible)
is
chapter
6,
days
3
of
the
book
of
church
order.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes,
sir,
that’s
correct.
mr.
owen
h.
page
excuse
my
degradation
but
i
want
a
sixth
amendment.
so
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
rightfully
then
looked
at
the
question
of
the
implied
trust.
they
examined
it
and
they
found
under
the
implied
trust,
of
course
in
a
church
property
dispute,
you
don’t
go
to
the
words
on
the
grant
because
we
don’t
have
an
express
trust
situation.
therefore,
the
court
has
to
look
at
the
church
doctrine
and
dogma
that
existed
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
of
the
property.
and
that’s
what
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
did
in
invoking
the
implied
trust.
mr.
owen
h.
page
because
of
the
fact
that
property
right
is
involved,
mr.
justice
and
this
is
historically
correct
in
cases
where
you
have
a
property
dispute
involving
church
and
then
the
civil
courts
have
the
right
above
a
sides
and
this
is
particularly
true
if
in
the
final
determination
it
is
a
question
of
violation
of
a
church
constitution
such
as
we
have
here.
this
was
specifically
alleged,
let
me
make
reference
to
those
parts
of
the
constitution
that
were
particularly
presented
and
alleged
to
have
been
violated.
mr.
owen
h.
page
no,
sir.
i
believe
that
question
has
already
been
resolved.
it
is
–
mr.
owen
h.
page
i
mean
the
question
of
the
violation
of
the
church
doctrine
and
dogma
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes,
sir.
but
in
examining
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
no,
sir.
i
don’t
think
we
are
going
into
the
question.
i
think
we
are
looking
at
a
different
situation.
we
aren’t
involved
in
faith
and
dogma.
what
we
have
here
and
the
court’s
have
looked
into
this
very
carefully
what
they
say
when
you
present
a
church
doctrine
or
dogma
in
the
implied
trust
such
as
this,
you
look
at
the
doctrine
and
dogma
just
to
determine
that
the
–
mr.
owen
h.
page
you
look
at
it
as
though
you
had
an
express
trust.
when
in
looking
at
the
implied
trust,
you
look
at
the
doctrine
and
dogma
that
existed
that
the
property
was
acquired
then
you
determine
if
there
has
been
a
violation
of
that
to
determine
if
the
implied
trust
has
been
breached.
mr.
owen
h.
page
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
i
had
observed
as
i
recall
that
the
respondent
churches
had
ceased
to
function.
i
think
this
was
an
attempt
to
bring
the
situation
within
that
section
of
the
book
of
church
order
and
which
has
been
identified,
i
think
yesterday
as
section
6-3.
oh,
a
complete
explanation
of
that
section,
if
the
court
will
referred
to
page
83
of
the
appendix.
but
let
me
just
sum
it
up
for
you.
that
refers
to
a
situation
in
which
we
either
have
a
church
which
has
withered
and
died
on
the
vine
or
one
which
is
in
the
process
of
withering.
now,
i
--
the
viability
of
these
churches
are,
i
think
is
manifested
by
the
fact
that
these
cases
are
before
you
today.
furthermore,
if
you
examine
the
action
of
the
administrative
commission
which
the
counsel
made
some
imports,
you
will
find,
there
was
a
completely
innocuous
act.
what
it
did,
it
did
more
than
--
did
nothing
more
than
accept
the
or
recognize
the
cessation,
you
might
say
or
removal
of
the
session
by
their
own
volition
and
then
it
said
in
effect
for
those
members
of
the
congregation
that
still
wish
to
worship,
we
will
furnish
you
a
minister.
so,
as
to
the
question
of
im
--
whether
these
judges
should
have
appealed
the
action
of
the
administrative
commission.
there
were
two
reasons
i
didn't
have
to.
first,
under
the
guard
of
the
first
amendment,
these
people
individually
or
collected
really
have
the
right
to
withdraw.
second,
the
constitution
of
the
presbyterian
church
has
no
prohibition
against
a
church
taking
this
action
and
this
too
is
in
the
record.
now,
i
briefly
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
prohibition
about
an
individual
church
withdrawing.
mr.
owen
h.
page
no,
sir.
i
was
just
rebutting
yesterday
that
i
thought
they
might
have
left
this
impression
and
i
was
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
owen
h.
page
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes,
with
one
qualification.
in
the
--
because
when
we
talked
about
the
implied
trust
mr.
justice,
we
are
talking
about
the
imposition
of
the
polity
which
is
the
doctrine
and
discipline
of
a
church
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
of
the
property.
now
what
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
found
below
and
this
was
on
its
statutory
mandate
that
the
court
invoked.
the
court
found
under
section
28
--
22408
of
the
georgia
code
that
when
a
property
is
devoted
to
a
specific
doctrine
or
trust,
the
court
will
intervene
to
prevent
it
--
the
property
being
diverted
to
a
doctrine
which
is
contrary
to
that
which
existed
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
of
the
property.
mr.
owen
h.
page
that
has
--
that's
--
yes
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yeah.
mr.
owen
h.
page
that's
correct,
that's
it.
so,
we
then
--
we
look
at
the
constitution
to
determine
what
was
imposed
upon
the
property
at
that
time
then
we
look
at
the
charged
transgressions
which
are
set
forth
in
the
action
and
the
resolution
of
the
judge
and
let
me
just
briefly
refer
to
it
and
i
think
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
this
trust
your
honor
under
the
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
mr.
justice,
no
sir,
there
was
no
--
not
--
we
are
here
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
it
was
created
under
the
--
i
would
assume
under
what
we
call
the
polity
of
this
particular
church
government
which
has
denied
a
knowledge
to
be
a
representative
type
of
church
but
the
representative
type
of
church
is
of
course
have
--
may
have
a
variation
of
polity.
for
example,
a
representative
type
of
church
may
be
representative
in
its
spiritual
relationships
as
we
acknowledge
here
but
it
may
have
congregational
aspects
in
relation
to
property.
so
what
we
have
here
under
the
theory
of
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir.
this
is
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
this
is
an
implication
your
honor
from
watson
versus
jones
that
they
said
in
that
particular
type
of
church
government
where
you
have
a
series
of
ascending
judicatories
that
there
is
an
implied
consent
absent
some
particular
transgression
of
the
constitution
that
it
is
held
for
the
benefit
of
the
church
as
a
whole.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
that's
in
the
secu
--
that
is
in
the
secular
law.
mr.
owen
h.
page
there
is
no
canonical
laws
supporting
this
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes,
that
--
in
gonzalez
versus
archbishop,
mr.
brandeis
--
mr.
justice
brandeis,
i
think
put
this
in
focus
for
all
of
us.
he
said
in
this
team,
this
i
think
was
about
1929
decision
some
years
after
watson
versus
jones
in
which
he
said,
“absent
for
evidence
of
fraud,
collusion
or
arbitrariness
that
the
secular
courts,
all
of
the
findings
of
an
ecclesiastical
court
in
matters
involving
ecclesiastical
law
even
though
civil
rights
are
involved.
now,
this
theory
has
been
followed
by
any
number
of
decisions
both
state
and
federal
subsequent
at
that
time.
so,
what
was
acknowledged
in
watson
versus
jones,
you
might
say
it
--
by
jones,
absolute
deference
to
the
authority
of
the
highest
church
court
is
no
longer,
it
has
been
cons
--
it
has
been
modified
and
the
court
may
now
look
beyond
the
rule
formulated
in
watson
as
to
the
three
--
as
to
the
types
of
churches
that
he
acknowledge
there.
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
subject
to
the
modification
and
--
then
gonzales.
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir.
i
--
may
i
take
this
exception.
when
we
look
--
you
see,
the
charge,
when
we
looked
at
the
charged
transgressions,
we
do
not
imply
into
the
faith
that
inspired
this
particular
constitutional
commandment
of
the
church
in
its
organic
law.
all
we
looked
is
at
this
organic
law
in
its
doctrine
and
discipline
as
a
factual,
is
purely
factual
matter.
mr.
owen
h.
page
well,
the
factual
matter
here
is
that
the
general
assembly
made
pronouncement
concerning
civil
disobedience
and
becoming
involved
in
civil
affairs
in
direct
conflict
with
the
church
--
with
its
--
with
church's
constitution.
the
constitution
says,
“
you
shall
not
do
this.”
mr.
owen
h.
page
well,
i
--
under
the
theory
we
are
having
to
move
along
on
sir,
we'll
have
to
go
on
a
theory
that
this
constitutes
a
breach
of
the
trust
and
under
the
law,
if
there
is
a
breach
in
the
trust
or
the
part
of
the
denomination
on
the
church
at
its
highest
level,
there
is
then
the
property
is
restored
to
those
who
are
still
uttering
the
concepts,
the
constitutional
concepts.
mr.
owen
h.
page
sir?
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
those
who
are
still
in
this
instance
as
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
found,
those
who
are
still
occupying
the
church
premises.
mr.
owen
h.
page
and
these
are
the
people
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir.
they
unanimously
voted
to
sever
their
relationship
with
the
presbyterian
church,
the
two
local
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes,
which
they
had
financed
by
their
tithes,
offering,
and
pledges
and
you
see,
you
have
a
difference
here,
the
other
thing
i'm
think
in
kedroff,
in
kedroff
there
was
some
evidence
as
i
recall
in
the
record
that
the
russian
based
church
had
money
in
the
cathedral
in
new
york.
there's
no
evidence
like
that
and
these
are
all
raised
by
the
local
people.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
and
the
subsequent
--
this
courts
have
had
expanded
the
word
arbitrariness
to
mean
an
ultra
vires
on
constitutional
act
and
these
are
clearly
charged
in
the
initial
pleadings
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner,
i
mean
of
the
respondents.
if
you
--
the
reference
would
be
in
the
appendices,
pages
--
in
appendix,
page
29
also
and
116
where
these
constitutional
violations
are
charged.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
--
from
our
constitution.
senates
and
counsels
are
to
handle
or
conclude
nothing
but
that
which
is
ecclesiastical
or
not
to
intermeddle
in
civil
affairs
with
concern
to
the
commonwealth.
lest
by
way
of
humble
petition
in
cases
all
extraordinary
by
way
of
advise
or
satisfaction
of
conscience.
if
they'd
be
there
until
required
and
then
the
other
violation
that
was
found,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
people
to
pray
for
the
magistrates
to
honor
their
persons
to
pay
them
tribute
and
other
dues
to
obey
their
lawful
commands
and
be
subject
to
their
authority
for
conscience
sake,
these
are
the
parts
of
the
cons
--.
mr.
owen
h.
page
the
specifications
are
in
the
resolution
which
bring
to
the
court's
attention
pronouncements
by
the
highest
tribunal
in
1965,
in
1966
in
which
the
highest
tribunal
where
on
the
record
condoning
civil
disobedience
and
embroiling
the
church
in
them
military
and
diplomatic
affairs
over
the
vietnam
war.
now,
these
were
the
basis,
the
primary
basis
for
the
action
that's
before
and
these
are
reflected
in
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
mr.
owen
h.
page
mr.
justice,
under
the
theory
that
is
presented
to
us
and
properly
right
being
involved,
it
of
necessity
has
to
go
before
the
courts.
mr.
owen
h.
page
that's
correct.
mr.
owen
h.
page
the
secular
court.
mr.
owen
h.
page
now,
in
this
particular
essence,
of
course
we
once
again
run
across
a
rather
unique
situation,
we
have
the
tribunal
of
the
supreme
tribunal
of
the
presbyterian
church
acts
both
as
a
legislative
agency
and
also
a
judicial
agency.
so
we
find
them
in
pronouncing
and
then
they're
going
to
stand
upon
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
i
think
when
people
submit
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
with
this
qualification
mr.
justice,
i
don't
believe
you
submit
absolutely
to
something
--
i
believe
you
submit
conditionally
that
the
people
to
whom
you
are
submitting
are
going
to
honor
their
consti
--
the
constitutional
concepts
of
that
government
or
agency
at
the
time
you
are
here.
i
don't
believe
they
have
any
absolute
right
to
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
well,
it
went
to
two
reasons.
first,
i
think
that
this
action
was
--
as
i
mentioned
has
made
on
a
highest
level
and
i
believe
it
might
have
been
a
little
exercised
in
futility
to
have
attacked
a
legislative
pronouncement
before
the
judicial
body
which
is
--
determine
its
own
legislative
act.
but
more
importantly
if
and
this
i
think
is
valid,
if
the
act
of
the
general
assembly
is
a
con
--
unconstitutional
act,
well,
if
they
did,
then
this,
i
don't
believe
that
it
imposes
any
responsibility
upon
the
lesser
tribunal
which
is
the
local
congregation
to
appeal
that
act.
and
certain
courts
where
this
situation
has
been
presented
where
the
highest
tribunal
has
been
accused
of
an
ultra
vires
or
unconstitutional
act.
it
said
known
app
--
no
appeal
is
necessary
because
i
don't
believe
this
--
it
impose
any
duty
on
it.
mr.
owen
h.
page
under
the
position
of
the
churches
set
forth
in
the
resolution
of
1880,
there
are
two
types
of
pronouncement.
one
is
the
judicial
decision
and
what
is
called
an
in
esse
and
is
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
an
in
esse
decision
such
as
this.
and
it
said
that
the
con
--
the
members
of
the
church
have
to
submit
to
both
with
equal
dignity
and
respect
unless
they
violate
the
constitution
of
the
presbyterian
church.
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir.
that's
basically
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
who
has
the
right
possession
and
used
the
property,
that's
correct.
mr.
owen
h.
page
that's
correct.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
so
that
it
can
possess
that
it's
a
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
that's
correct.
mr.
owen
h.
page
that's
correct.
the
sort
of
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
that's
right.
mr.
owen
h.
page
well,
i'm
worrying
sir
if
that
assessment
hasn't
been
made.
mr.
owen
h.
page
hasn't
been
made
initially
in
the
--
when
it
was
presented
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
owen
h.
page
to
impart,
i
mean.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
i'll
understood
his
question
so
much
when
he
said,
“basically
isn't
the
question
who
is
entitled
to
the
possession
of
the
property.”
that's
what
i
thought
he
asked
me.
mr.
owen
h.
page
they
simply
come
down
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
and
--
in
applying
the
proper
church
polity
to
it
in
this
instance.
because
in
this
instance,
we
find
out
under
the
theory
of,
what
was
known
as
prescribed
use
in
watson
versus
jones
that
the
right
to
dictate
this
property
as
far
as
use,
alienation,
acquisition,
who
shall
be
the
minister,
who
shall
finance
the
church
programs
and
discipline
all
are
under
the
church
constitution
given
to
the
local
church.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
then
you
would
have
to
look
as
this
--
in
the
record
as
to
the
historical
position
of
this
church
in
relation
to
his
church
property
in
way
of
the
pledge
--
in
the
way
it
is
recognized,
the
autonomy
of
the
church
control
in
the
local
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
well,
i
don't
know.
i
know
that's
a
raging
problem.
i
don't
know
whether
--
what
status
that
has
within
the
catholic
church.
well,
it's
a
canonical
situation
or
not,
i
couldn't
answer
mr.
-
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes.
well,
i
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
well,
the
watson,
this
subsequently
modified
watson.
now,
a
subsequent
state
and
federal
--
for
example,
in
kedroff,
kedroff
even
said,
“we
believe
the
right
to
select
clergy
where
no
improper
methods
are
shown”
is
given
constitutional
(inaudible).
so
it
gives
this
court
the
right
to
look
in
and
that's
we
--
what
we
contend
and
historically
where
property
has
been
in
dispute.
the
court
has
looked
in.
but
may
i
suggest
this
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
well,
i
--
yes
and
i
may
i
answer
this
way,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
church
can
only
claim
the
protection
of
the
--
over
the
first
amendment,
free
exercise
if
it
operates
within
the
framework
of
its
own
constitution.
and
that
--
there's
no
restraint
of
this
church
action
here
as
long
as
it
operates
within
the
constitution
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
that's
correct.
and
they're
asking
of
the
highest
church
tribunal
the
same
constitutional
accountability
that
they
would
impose
on
the
lesser.
but
let
me
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
the
thrust
of
the
charge
was
encompassed
to
all
of
them
mr.
justice.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
and
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
in
addition
of
it.
let
me
just
conclude
on
this
one,
i
believe
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
mr.
justice
there
was
no
evidence
submitted
on
that
so
i
think
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
the
--
that
all
i
know
sir
is
the
evidence
which
was
introduced
which
was
the
basis
for
the
action
of
the
court.
now
let
me
just
conclude
on
this
order.
mr.
owen
h.
page
quite
frankly
mr.
justice,
i
couldn't
answer
that.
mr.
owen
h.
page
(voice
overlap)
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir.
for
two
reasons,
first
i
am
not
a
presbyterian
and
i
was
not
member
of
these
church
congregations
at
the
time
this
initial
action
was
taken.
mr.
owen
h.
page
well,
this
abide
as
which
you
have
been
introduced
as
a
matter
of
proof,
now
that's
the
only
way
i
can
respond
to
that.
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
the
--
i
think
that
what
the
--
under
the
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
--
tragic
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
but
that
was
under
the
instructions
of
the
court.
let
me
just
conclude
this.
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir.
the
judge
was
not
a
presbyterian.
mr.
owen
h.
page
mr.
justice
i
assume
that
addresses
it
to
the
judge
himself,
i'd
say,
i
wouldn't
ask
him
to
be
disqualified.
in
conclusion,
i
find
this
--
if
you
look
at
the
record
to
it,
there
is
a
fatal
federal
question
before
this
court
and
i
submit
that
the
--
that
this
case
should
be
dismissed
because
there
is
no
federal
question
before
the
court
since
it'll
be
raise.
and
here's
what
the
four
points
that
they
raised,
they
said
that
federal
question
was
raised
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
on
a
motion
for
rehearing
and
that
that
many
questions
thrust
before
that
court
were
entertained.
the
federal
question
was
--
the
motion
was
entertained
and
the
many
federal
questions
presented
were
answered.
that
is
not
the
record
in
the
writing
and
it
of
course,
this
violates
the
historic
position
of
this
court
that
on
a
motion
for
rehearing
when
the
federal
question
is
raised
for
the
first
time,
you
must
entertain
and
decide.
the
other
question
was
that
in
overruling
matt
v.
kahn
(ph)
it
violated
the
rule
of
stare
decisis.
this
is
--
again
this
georgia
court
has
adopted
the
federal
rule
and
that
you
do
not
have
a
vested
right
in
a
prior
decision
and
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
so
ruled.
looking
again
at
the
other,
that
the
overruling
matt
versus
kahn
(ph)
violated
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
application
of
watson
versus
jones.
this
is
not
the
case.
matt
versus
kahn
(ph)
specifically
stated
that
on
a
proper
showing
of
a
complete
abandonment
of
the
dogma
and
doctrine
that
the
court
would
then
protect
the
rights
of
the
local
property,
local
church
who
were
adhering
to
the
dogma
and
discipline.
so
this
comes
as
absolutely
no
surprise
there.
all
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
did
was
to
modify
its
substantive
law
which
had
had
the
right
to
do
any
change,
the
complete
task
to
that
of
--
substantial.
and
finally,
they
contend
that
the
federal
question
was
properly
raised
on
the
local
at
the
initial
level
in
the
trial
court
by
the
general
allegation
that
the
--
this
act
that
they
--
act
in
appropriating
the
property
would
violate
it,
the
laws
of
the
united
states
of
america.
this
lack
--
they
require
specificity
of
the
state
court
and
also
the
federal
court
and
there
was
no
motion
or
other
appropriate
action
taken
in
the
trial
court
to
bring
this
federal
question
to
the
state
court
and
thus
to
this
court.
thank
you
so
much.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
i
think
it
does.
mr.
owen
h.
page
in
answer
to
it,
it
would
run
together
approximately
a
hundred
and
seventy
thousand
dollars.
mr.
owen
h.
page
the
application
of
it.
mr.
owen
h.
page
that's
a
factual
determination.
mr.
owen
h.
page
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
that's
right.
mr.
owen
h.
page
if
--
unless
there
was
a
violation
of
the
trust.
mr.
owen
h.
page
well,
the
federal
courts
haven't
held
that
mr.
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
well,
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
i
would
--
yes,
i
would
be
in
the
position
with
a
tennis
player
who
was
at
match
point
where
they
had
out.
and
so
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
i
would
say,
first
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
and
i
would
employ
you
not
to
do
that.
mr.
owen
h.
page
i
can
take
exception
to
do
that
under
the
precedence
that
have
preceded
this
case
here.
mr.
owen
h.
page
well
sir,
i
certainly
welcome
that,
i
play
a
little
tennis
because
it's
nice
to
win.
thank
you
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
can
put
this
in
a
correct
prospective
point.
at
the
time
these
churches,
the
local
churches
withdrew
in
april
1966
in
the
resolution
of
disaffiliation,
they
charged
the
denomination
or
church
with
specific
violations
of
the
church
doctrine/dogma
and
discipline.
now
in
light
of
that,
then
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
rightfully
there
being
an
--
and
mr.
justice
white,
the
only
reference
in
the
book
of
church
order
to
the
right
of
a
presbyterian
at
(inaudible)
is
chapter
6,
days
3
of
the
book
of
church
order.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes,
sir,
that’s
correct.
mr.
owen
h.
page
excuse
my
degradation
but
i
want
a
sixth
amendment.
so
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
rightfully
then
looked
at
the
question
of
the
implied
trust.
they
examined
it
and
they
found
under
the
implied
trust,
of
course
in
a
church
property
dispute,
you
don’t
go
to
the
words
on
the
grant
because
we
don’t
have
an
express
trust
situation.
therefore,
the
court
has
to
look
at
the
church
doctrine
and
dogma
that
existed
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
of
the
property.
and
that’s
what
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
did
in
invoking
the
implied
trust.
mr.
owen
h.
page
because
of
the
fact
that
property
right
is
involved,
mr.
justice
and
this
is
historically
correct
in
cases
where
you
have
a
property
dispute
involving
church
and
then
the
civil
courts
have
the
right
above
a
sides
and
this
is
particularly
true
if
in
the
final
determination
it
is
a
question
of
violation
of
a
church
constitution
such
as
we
have
here.
this
was
specifically
alleged,
let
me
make
reference
to
those
parts
of
the
constitution
that
were
particularly
presented
and
alleged
to
have
been
violated.
mr.
owen
h.
page
no,
sir.
i
believe
that
question
has
already
been
resolved.
it
is
–
mr.
owen
h.
page
i
mean
the
question
of
the
violation
of
the
church
doctrine
and
dogma
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes,
sir.
but
in
examining
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
no,
sir.
i
don’t
think
we
are
going
into
the
question.
i
think
we
are
looking
at
a
different
situation.
we
aren’t
involved
in
faith
and
dogma.
what
we
have
here
and
the
court’s
have
looked
into
this
very
carefully
what
they
say
when
you
present
a
church
doctrine
or
dogma
in
the
implied
trust
such
as
this,
you
look
at
the
doctrine
and
dogma
just
to
determine
that
the
–
mr.
owen
h.
page
you
look
at
it
as
though
you
had
an
express
trust.
when
in
looking
at
the
implied
trust,
you
look
at
the
doctrine
and
dogma
that
existed
that
the
property
was
acquired
then
you
determine
if
there
has
been
a
violation
of
that
to
determine
if
the
implied
trust
has
been
breached.
mr.
owen
h.
page
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
yesterday,
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
i
had
observed
as
i
recall
that
the
respondent
churches
had
ceased
to
function.
i
think
this
was
an
attempt
to
bring
the
situation
within
that
section
of
the
book
of
church
order
and
which
has
been
identified,
i
think
yesterday
as
section
6-3.
oh,
a
complete
explanation
of
that
section,
if
the
court
will
referred
to
page
83
of
the
appendix.
but
let
me
just
sum
it
up
for
you.
that
refers
to
a
situation
in
which
we
either
have
a
church
which
has
withered
and
died
on
the
vine
or
one
which
is
in
the
process
of
withering.
now,
i
--
the
viability
of
these
churches
are,
i
think
is
manifested
by
the
fact
that
these
cases
are
before
you
today.
furthermore,
if
you
examine
the
action
of
the
administrative
commission
which
the
counsel
made
some
imports,
you
will
find,
there
was
a
completely
innocuous
act.
what
it
did,
it
did
more
than
--
did
nothing
more
than
accept
the
or
recognize
the
cessation,
you
might
say
or
removal
of
the
session
by
their
own
volition
and
then
it
said
in
effect
for
those
members
of
the
congregation
that
still
wish
to
worship,
we
will
furnish
you
a
minister.
so,
as
to
the
question
of
im
--
whether
these
judges
should
have
appealed
the
action
of
the
administrative
commission.
there
were
two
reasons
i
didn't
have
to.
first,
under
the
guard
of
the
first
amendment,
these
people
individually
or
collected
really
have
the
right
to
withdraw.
second,
the
constitution
of
the
presbyterian
church
has
no
prohibition
against
a
church
taking
this
action
and
this
too
is
in
the
record.
now,
i
briefly
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
prohibition
about
an
individual
church
withdrawing.
mr.
owen
h.
page
no,
sir.
i
was
just
rebutting
yesterday
that
i
thought
they
might
have
left
this
impression
and
i
was
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
owen
h.
page
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes,
with
one
qualification.
in
the
--
because
when
we
talked
about
the
implied
trust
mr.
justice,
we
are
talking
about
the
imposition
of
the
polity
which
is
the
doctrine
and
discipline
of
a
church
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
of
the
property.
now
what
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
found
below
and
this
was
on
its
statutory
mandate
that
the
court
invoked.
the
court
found
under
section
28
--
22408
of
the
georgia
code
that
when
a
property
is
devoted
to
a
specific
doctrine
or
trust,
the
court
will
intervene
to
prevent
it
--
the
property
being
diverted
to
a
doctrine
which
is
contrary
to
that
which
existed
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
of
the
property.
mr.
owen
h.
page
that
has
--
that's
--
yes
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yeah.
mr.
owen
h.
page
that's
correct,
that's
it.
so,
we
then
--
we
look
at
the
constitution
to
determine
what
was
imposed
upon
the
property
at
that
time
then
we
look
at
the
charged
transgressions
which
are
set
forth
in
the
action
and
the
resolution
of
the
judge
and
let
me
just
briefly
refer
to
it
and
i
think
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
this
trust
your
honor
under
the
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
mr.
justice,
no
sir,
there
was
no
--
not
--
we
are
here
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
it
was
created
under
the
--
i
would
assume
under
what
we
call
the
polity
of
this
particular
church
government
which
has
denied
a
knowledge
to
be
a
representative
type
of
church
but
the
representative
type
of
church
is
of
course
have
--
may
have
a
variation
of
polity.
for
example,
a
representative
type
of
church
may
be
representative
in
its
spiritual
relationships
as
we
acknowledge
here
but
it
may
have
congregational
aspects
in
relation
to
property.
so
what
we
have
here
under
the
theory
of
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir.
this
is
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
this
is
an
implication
your
honor
from
watson
versus
jones
that
they
said
in
that
particular
type
of
church
government
where
you
have
a
series
of
ascending
judicatories
that
there
is
an
implied
consent
absent
some
particular
transgression
of
the
constitution
that
it
is
held
for
the
benefit
of
the
church
as
a
whole.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
that's
in
the
secu
--
that
is
in
the
secular
law.
mr.
owen
h.
page
there
is
no
canonical
laws
supporting
this
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes,
that
--
in
gonzalez
versus
archbishop,
mr.
brandeis
--
mr.
justice
brandeis,
i
think
put
this
in
focus
for
all
of
us.
he
said
in
this
team,
this
i
think
was
about
1929
decision
some
years
after
watson
versus
jones
in
which
he
said,
“absent
for
evidence
of
fraud,
collusion
or
arbitrariness
that
the
secular
courts,
all
of
the
findings
of
an
ecclesiastical
court
in
matters
involving
ecclesiastical
law
even
though
civil
rights
are
involved.
now,
this
theory
has
been
followed
by
any
number
of
decisions
both
state
and
federal
subsequent
at
that
time.
so,
what
was
acknowledged
in
watson
versus
jones,
you
might
say
it
--
by
jones,
absolute
deference
to
the
authority
of
the
highest
church
court
is
no
longer,
it
has
been
cons
--
it
has
been
modified
and
the
court
may
now
look
beyond
the
rule
formulated
in
watson
as
to
the
three
--
as
to
the
types
of
churches
that
he
acknowledge
there.
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
subject
to
the
modification
and
--
then
gonzales.
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir.
i
--
may
i
take
this
exception.
when
we
look
--
you
see,
the
charge,
when
we
looked
at
the
charged
transgressions,
we
do
not
imply
into
the
faith
that
inspired
this
particular
constitutional
commandment
of
the
church
in
its
organic
law.
all
we
looked
is
at
this
organic
law
in
its
doctrine
and
discipline
as
a
factual,
is
purely
factual
matter.
mr.
owen
h.
page
well,
the
factual
matter
here
is
that
the
general
assembly
made
pronouncement
concerning
civil
disobedience
and
becoming
involved
in
civil
affairs
in
direct
conflict
with
the
church
--
with
its
--
with
church's
constitution.
the
constitution
says,
“
you
shall
not
do
this.”
mr.
owen
h.
page
well,
i
--
under
the
theory
we
are
having
to
move
along
on
sir,
we'll
have
to
go
on
a
theory
that
this
constitutes
a
breach
of
the
trust
and
under
the
law,
if
there
is
a
breach
in
the
trust
or
the
part
of
the
denomination
on
the
church
at
its
highest
level,
there
is
then
the
property
is
restored
to
those
who
are
still
uttering
the
concepts,
the
constitutional
concepts.
mr.
owen
h.
page
sir?
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
those
who
are
still
in
this
instance
as
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
found,
those
who
are
still
occupying
the
church
premises.
mr.
owen
h.
page
and
these
are
the
people
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir.
they
unanimously
voted
to
sever
their
relationship
with
the
presbyterian
church,
the
two
local
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes,
which
they
had
financed
by
their
tithes,
offering,
and
pledges
and
you
see,
you
have
a
difference
here,
the
other
thing
i'm
think
in
kedroff,
in
kedroff
there
was
some
evidence
as
i
recall
in
the
record
that
the
russian
based
church
had
money
in
the
cathedral
in
new
york.
there's
no
evidence
like
that
and
these
are
all
raised
by
the
local
people.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
and
the
subsequent
--
this
courts
have
had
expanded
the
word
arbitrariness
to
mean
an
ultra
vires
on
constitutional
act
and
these
are
clearly
charged
in
the
initial
pleadings
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner,
i
mean
of
the
respondents.
if
you
--
the
reference
would
be
in
the
appendices,
pages
--
in
appendix,
page
29
also
and
116
where
these
constitutional
violations
are
charged.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
--
from
our
constitution.
senates
and
counsels
are
to
handle
or
conclude
nothing
but
that
which
is
ecclesiastical
or
not
to
intermeddle
in
civil
affairs
with
concern
to
the
commonwealth.
lest
by
way
of
humble
petition
in
cases
all
extraordinary
by
way
of
advise
or
satisfaction
of
conscience.
if
they'd
be
there
until
required
and
then
the
other
violation
that
was
found,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
people
to
pray
for
the
magistrates
to
honor
their
persons
to
pay
them
tribute
and
other
dues
to
obey
their
lawful
commands
and
be
subject
to
their
authority
for
conscience
sake,
these
are
the
parts
of
the
cons
--.
mr.
owen
h.
page
the
specifications
are
in
the
resolution
which
bring
to
the
court's
attention
pronouncements
by
the
highest
tribunal
in
1965,
in
1966
in
which
the
highest
tribunal
where
on
the
record
condoning
civil
disobedience
and
embroiling
the
church
in
them
military
and
diplomatic
affairs
over
the
vietnam
war.
now,
these
were
the
basis,
the
primary
basis
for
the
action
that's
before
and
these
are
reflected
in
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
georgia.
mr.
owen
h.
page
mr.
justice,
under
the
theory
that
is
presented
to
us
and
properly
right
being
involved,
it
of
necessity
has
to
go
before
the
courts.
mr.
owen
h.
page
that's
correct.
mr.
owen
h.
page
the
secular
court.
mr.
owen
h.
page
now,
in
this
particular
essence,
of
course
we
once
again
run
across
a
rather
unique
situation,
we
have
the
tribunal
of
the
supreme
tribunal
of
the
presbyterian
church
acts
both
as
a
legislative
agency
and
also
a
judicial
agency.
so
we
find
them
in
pronouncing
and
then
they're
going
to
stand
upon
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
i
think
when
people
submit
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
with
this
qualification
mr.
justice,
i
don't
believe
you
submit
absolutely
to
something
--
i
believe
you
submit
conditionally
that
the
people
to
whom
you
are
submitting
are
going
to
honor
their
consti
--
the
constitutional
concepts
of
that
government
or
agency
at
the
time
you
are
here.
i
don't
believe
they
have
any
absolute
right
to
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
well,
it
went
to
two
reasons.
first,
i
think
that
this
action
was
--
as
i
mentioned
has
made
on
a
highest
level
and
i
believe
it
might
have
been
a
little
exercised
in
futility
to
have
attacked
a
legislative
pronouncement
before
the
judicial
body
which
is
--
determine
its
own
legislative
act.
but
more
importantly
if
and
this
i
think
is
valid,
if
the
act
of
the
general
assembly
is
a
con
--
unconstitutional
act,
well,
if
they
did,
then
this,
i
don't
believe
that
it
imposes
any
responsibility
upon
the
lesser
tribunal
which
is
the
local
congregation
to
appeal
that
act.
and
certain
courts
where
this
situation
has
been
presented
where
the
highest
tribunal
has
been
accused
of
an
ultra
vires
or
unconstitutional
act.
it
said
known
app
--
no
appeal
is
necessary
because
i
don't
believe
this
--
it
impose
any
duty
on
it.
mr.
owen
h.
page
under
the
position
of
the
churches
set
forth
in
the
resolution
of
1880,
there
are
two
types
of
pronouncement.
one
is
the
judicial
decision
and
what
is
called
an
in
esse
and
is
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
an
in
esse
decision
such
as
this.
and
it
said
that
the
con
--
the
members
of
the
church
have
to
submit
to
both
with
equal
dignity
and
respect
unless
they
violate
the
constitution
of
the
presbyterian
church.
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir.
that's
basically
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir.
that's
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
who
has
the
right
possession
and
used
the
property,
that's
correct.
mr.
owen
h.
page
that's
correct.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
so
that
it
can
possess
that
it's
a
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
that's
correct.
mr.
owen
h.
page
that's
correct.
the
sort
of
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
that's
right.
mr.
owen
h.
page
well,
i'm
worrying
sir
if
that
assessment
hasn't
been
made.
mr.
owen
h.
page
hasn't
been
made
initially
in
the
--
when
it
was
presented
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
owen
h.
page
to
impart,
i
mean.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
i'll
understood
his
question
so
much
when
he
said,
“basically
isn't
the
question
who
is
entitled
to
the
possession
of
the
property.”
that's
what
i
thought
he
asked
me.
mr.
owen
h.
page
they
simply
come
down
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
and
--
in
applying
the
proper
church
polity
to
it
in
this
instance.
because
in
this
instance,
we
find
out
under
the
theory
of,
what
was
known
as
prescribed
use
in
watson
versus
jones
that
the
right
to
dictate
this
property
as
far
as
use,
alienation,
acquisition,
who
shall
be
the
minister,
who
shall
finance
the
church
programs
and
discipline
all
are
under
the
church
constitution
given
to
the
local
church.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
then
you
would
have
to
look
as
this
--
in
the
record
as
to
the
historical
position
of
this
church
in
relation
to
his
church
property
in
way
of
the
pledge
--
in
the
way
it
is
recognized,
the
autonomy
of
the
church
control
in
the
local
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
well,
i
don't
know.
i
know
that's
a
raging
problem.
i
don't
know
whether
--
what
status
that
has
within
the
catholic
church.
well,
it's
a
canonical
situation
or
not,
i
couldn't
answer
mr.
-
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes.
well,
i
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
well,
the
watson,
this
subsequently
modified
watson.
now,
a
subsequent
state
and
federal
--
for
example,
in
kedroff,
kedroff
even
said,
“we
believe
the
right
to
select
clergy
where
no
improper
methods
are
shown”
is
given
constitutional
(inaudible).
so
it
gives
this
court
the
right
to
look
in
and
that's
we
--
what
we
contend
and
historically
where
property
has
been
in
dispute.
the
court
has
looked
in.
but
may
i
suggest
this
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
well,
i
--
yes
and
i
may
i
answer
this
way,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
church
can
only
claim
the
protection
of
the
--
over
the
first
amendment,
free
exercise
if
it
operates
within
the
framework
of
its
own
constitution.
and
that
--
there's
no
restraint
of
this
church
action
here
as
long
as
it
operates
within
the
constitution
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
that's
correct.
and
they're
asking
of
the
highest
church
tribunal
the
same
constitutional
accountability
that
they
would
impose
on
the
lesser.
but
let
me
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
the
thrust
of
the
charge
was
encompassed
to
all
of
them
mr.
justice.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
and
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
in
addition
of
it.
let
me
just
conclude
on
this
one,
i
believe
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
mr.
justice
there
was
no
evidence
submitted
on
that
so
i
think
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
the
--
that
all
i
know
sir
is
the
evidence
which
was
introduced
which
was
the
basis
for
the
action
of
the
court.
now
let
me
just
conclude
on
this
order.
mr.
owen
h.
page
quite
frankly
mr.
justice,
i
couldn't
answer
that.
mr.
owen
h.
page
(voice
overlap)
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir.
for
two
reasons,
first
i
am
not
a
presbyterian
and
i
was
not
member
of
these
church
congregations
at
the
time
this
initial
action
was
taken.
mr.
owen
h.
page
well,
this
abide
as
which
you
have
been
introduced
as
a
matter
of
proof,
now
that's
the
only
way
i
can
respond
to
that.
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
the
--
i
think
that
what
the
--
under
the
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
--
tragic
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
but
that
was
under
the
instructions
of
the
court.
let
me
just
conclude
this.
mr.
owen
h.
page
no
sir.
the
judge
was
not
a
presbyterian.
mr.
owen
h.
page
mr.
justice
i
assume
that
addresses
it
to
the
judge
himself,
i'd
say,
i
wouldn't
ask
him
to
be
disqualified.
in
conclusion,
i
find
this
--
if
you
look
at
the
record
to
it,
there
is
a
fatal
federal
question
before
this
court
and
i
submit
that
the
--
that
this
case
should
be
dismissed
because
there
is
no
federal
question
before
the
court
since
it'll
be
raise.
and
here's
what
the
four
points
that
they
raised,
they
said
that
federal
question
was
raised
in
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
on
a
motion
for
rehearing
and
that
that
many
questions
thrust
before
that
court
were
entertained.
the
federal
question
was
--
the
motion
was
entertained
and
the
many
federal
questions
presented
were
answered.
that
is
not
the
record
in
the
writing
and
it
of
course,
this
violates
the
historic
position
of
this
court
that
on
a
motion
for
rehearing
when
the
federal
question
is
raised
for
the
first
time,
you
must
entertain
and
decide.
the
other
question
was
that
in
overruling
matt
v.
kahn
(ph)
it
violated
the
rule
of
stare
decisis.
this
is
--
again
this
georgia
court
has
adopted
the
federal
rule
and
that
you
do
not
have
a
vested
right
in
a
prior
decision
and
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
so
ruled.
looking
again
at
the
other,
that
the
overruling
matt
versus
kahn
(ph)
violated
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
application
of
watson
versus
jones.
this
is
not
the
case.
matt
versus
kahn
(ph)
specifically
stated
that
on
a
proper
showing
of
a
complete
abandonment
of
the
dogma
and
doctrine
that
the
court
would
then
protect
the
rights
of
the
local
property,
local
church
who
were
adhering
to
the
dogma
and
discipline.
so
this
comes
as
absolutely
no
surprise
there.
all
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
did
was
to
modify
its
substantive
law
which
had
had
the
right
to
do
any
change,
the
complete
task
to
that
of
--
substantial.
and
finally,
they
contend
that
the
federal
question
was
properly
raised
on
the
local
at
the
initial
level
in
the
trial
court
by
the
general
allegation
that
the
--
this
act
that
they
--
act
in
appropriating
the
property
would
violate
it,
the
laws
of
the
united
states
of
america.
this
lack
--
they
require
specificity
of
the
state
court
and
also
the
federal
court
and
there
was
no
motion
or
other
appropriate
action
taken
in
the
trial
court
to
bring
this
federal
question
to
the
state
court
and
thus
to
this
court.
thank
you
so
much.
mr.
owen
h.
page
yes
sir.
i
think
it
does.
mr.
owen
h.
page
in
answer
to
it,
it
would
run
together
approximately
a
hundred
and
seventy
thousand
dollars.
mr.
owen
h.
page
the
application
of
it.
mr.
owen
h.
page
that's
a
factual
determination.
mr.
owen
h.
page
that's
correct
sir.
mr.
owen
h.
page
that's
right.
mr.
owen
h.

if
--
unless
there
was
a
violation
of
the
trust.
mr.
owen
h.
page
well,
the
federal
courts
haven't
held
that
mr.
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
well,
--
mr.
owen
h.
page
i
would
