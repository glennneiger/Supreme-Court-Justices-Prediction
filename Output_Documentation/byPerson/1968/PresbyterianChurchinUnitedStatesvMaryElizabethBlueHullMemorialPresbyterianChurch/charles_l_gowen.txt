mr.
charles
l.
gowen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
presbyterian
church
in
the
united
states,
the
petitioner,
is
a
hierarchical
church,
sometimes
called
the
southern
presbyterian
church.
the
first
step
in
the
church
government
is
the
“session”,
composed
of
ruling
elders
and
the
pastor
of
the
local
church.
the
next
is
the
“presbyterian”,
which
is
composed
of
representatives
of
local
churches
in
a
geographical
area
and
also
the
ministers
from
those
churches.
under
the
form
of
government
of
this
church,
a
pastor
of
a
local
church
is
not
a
member
of
the
local
church
but
is
a
member
of
the
presbyterian.
the
next
is
the
“senate”,
which
generally
but
not
always
corresponds
to
state
lines
and
which
is
composed
of
representatives
of
the
local
churches
together
with
the
ministers
in
the
included
presbyterians.
next
is
the
“general
assembly”,
which
is
composed
of
representatives
of
presbyterians,
divided
equally
between
ministers
and
laymen.
this
also
constitutes
the
courts
of
each
government
church;
the
general
assembly
being
the
highest
court
in
the
denomination.
in
april
of
1966,
the
congregation
of
two
local
churches
of
this
church
voted
to
savor
all
connections
will
and
remove
themselves
from
all
ecclesiastical
control,
jurisdiction
and
oversight
of
the
presbyterian
church
in
the
united
states
and
so
notified
the
presbytery
of
savannah.
the
savannah
presbytery
then
appointed
an
administrative
commission
under
the
law
of
the
church
with
full
authority
to
act
on
the
premises
and
with
special
instructions
to
visit
the
ruling
elders
of
each
church
-
the
ruling
elders
constituting
the
session,
which
as
i
have
said
is
the
governing
body
of
the
local
church.
after
each
elder
in
each
church
saved
one,
reaffirmed
the
action
and
after
the
pastor
of
each
church
had
reaffirmed
his
renunciation
of
the
presbyterian
church
in
the
united
states,
the
commission,
by
a
resolution,
that’s
the
administrative
commission
of
the
presbyterian,
by
resolution
declared
the
pulpit
of
these
church
to
be
vacant
because
administers
had
savored
all
the
connections
with
the
church
and
assume
the
regional
jurisdiction
over
these
local
churches
in
accordance
with
the
book
of
church
order
which
is
part
of
the
record
in
this
case
and
declared
that
commission’s
intention
to
secure
ministers
to
provided
regular
services
of
worship
in
the
sanctuaries
of
each
of
the
two
local
churches
for
those
members
who
wish
to
continue
their
membership
and
communion
with
the
general
church.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
we
will
cover
that
but
the
decision
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
we
think
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
on
the
basis
of
the
implied
trust.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
no,
sir,
but
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
no,
sir.
when
you
join
the
church,
the
book
of
church
order
contains
the
procedure
under
which
the
local
churches
are
maintained.
the
book
of
church
order
says
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
i
don’t
think
it
says
anything
about
the
property
but
it
does
say
who
has
the
use
and
the
right
to
occupy
the
church
when
the
church
ceases
to
function
as
a
church
in
the
denomination.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
that’s
in
book
of
church
order,
section
16-7(a)
or
it
may
7(d).
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
it’s
not
in
the
appendix.
it’s
in
the
record.
the
book
of
church
order
is
a
part
of
the
record
that
is
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
it
is
not
in
the
printed
record.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
no,
sir,
it
is
not
been
quoted
in
the
brief
but
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
well,
the
decision
in
the
statement
in
the
church
law
is
that
when
a
local
church
ceases
to
function
as
a
church;
that
the
property
then
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
general
church
and
our
position
is,
that
this
local
church
has
ceased
to
function.
the
finding
of
the
administrative
commission
was
that
one
elder
did
not
constitute
the
session;
that
there
was
no
session
to
govern
the
church
and
that
it
had
no
minister.
and
that
therefore,
the
administrative
commission
would
take
the
occupancy
and
use
of
the
property
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
the
dedication
of
the
property
which
came
about
when
the
local
churches
affiliated
with
the
general
church.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
it’s
in
the
record
–
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
it’s
in
the
book
itself.
it’s
a
part
of
the
record.
the
book
of
church
order
is
a
part
of
the
record.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes,
i’ll
be
happy
to
do
that.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
i
think
it
was
from
the
circumstances
of
acquisition
and
also
from
the
general
politic
of
the
church
that
has
existed
for
a
hundred
years.
i
think
it
was
also
the
decision
in
--
had
been
decided
in
the
numerous
other
jurisdictions
that
this
was
the
politic
of
the
presbyterian
church
and
we
have
cited
those
in
our
brief.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
politic
is
the
laws
and
the
practices
of
the
church.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
the
state
court
has
founded
and
the
local
court,
local
state
court
founded
and
the
respondents
have
never
questioned.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
they
don’t
question
it
here.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
indeed
the
judge
suggesting
in
a
possible
way,
we
could
leave
it
to
the
church
government
itself.
i
think
it’s
been
left
to
the
church
government
because
the
church
government,
the
administrative
commission
of
the
presbyterian,
which
was
opponent
in
the
accordance
with
the
book
of
church
order
which
is
a
constitution
of
the
government
of
the
church
made
this
finding.
and
the
local
churches
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
no.
they
found
first
the
administrative
commission
of
the
presbyterian,
was
appointed
to
go
and
see
these
churches
and
to
find
out/discuss
with
them
the
differences
at
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
withdrawn?
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
secede
--
two
churches
on
savannah.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
only
two.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
that’s
as
far
as
the
records
show
and
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
two
churches
and
the
rest
of
the
denomination.
but
the
church
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
it’s
over
--
we
think
it’s
over
religious
matters.
the
court
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes,
while
here’s
what
the
differences
were
-
first
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
the
first
was
a
statement
in
some
sunday
school
literature
about
civil
disobedience.
the
evidence
was
on
the
trial
of
the
case
and
the
local
churches
didn’t
even
use
the
sunday
school
literature
and
what
required
to
use
it.
there
was
also
a
statement
by
the
general
assembly
of
the
church
on
civil
disobedience
as
a
final
resort
to
secure
individuals
their
rights.
that
statement
on
civil
disobedience
is
in
the
record;
the
summation
of
it
is
on
page
58.
i
think
it’s
relatively
mild
statement
of
it.
it
ends
up
by
saying
that
it
regard
civil
disobedience
as
a
measure
of
last
resort,
to
be
employed
only
on
circumstances
otherwise
herein
mediatable
need.
and
then
the
exercise
of
which,
the
whole
concept
of
law
is
not
denied
but
affirmed.
and
to
continue
the
support
and
regard
with
compassion,
those
who
practice
civil
disobedience
when
no
legal
recourse
has
been
left
open
to
them
and
you
act
in
christian
conscience
and
a
legions
to
almighty
god.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes,
sir.
they
are
submitted
to
the
jury
as
whether
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes,
the
jury
passed
on
that.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
they
held
that
it
was
a
departure
from
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
civil
disobedience
was
a
departure
from
the
tenets
and
doctrines
of
the
presbyterian
church
in
the
united
states
as
they
existed
in
1861.
and
as
they
existed
in
1890,
when
one
of
these
local
churches
affiliated
with,
and
that
the
holding
was,
is
apparently
they
adopted
the
english
rule
that
was
rejected
by
this
court
on
watson
vs.
jones
and
said
“that
you
couldn’t
change
the
doctrine
that
existed
in
1861
of
the
time
when
the
church
affiliations
because
of
--
they
were
bound
by.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
they
decided
in
favor
of
the
two
local
churches
and
the
court.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes,
sir
and
the
court
made
a
statement
that
the
state
went
on
the
civil
disobedience,
this
is
a
court
in
the
georgia
supreme
court,
is
an
absolute
defiance
of
law
on
order
and
this
is
the
road
to
anarchy.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
that’s
the
issue.
and
our
contention
is,
that
under
the
first
amendment
as
construed
in
watson
vs.
jones
and
in
kedroff
vs.
st.
nicholas
cathedral
that
this
court
has
held
that
under
the
free
exercise
and
establishment
clauses
of
the
first
amendment
that
the
civil
courts
do
not
have
a
right
to
inquire
into
those
matters
but
those
matters
are
for
decision
by
the
ecclesiastic
courts.
and
that
is
the
question
and
the
issue
that
we
think
it’s
been
in
disposed
of
by
watson
vs.
jones
which
was
not
decided
on
constitutional
grounds
originally
but
we
believed
was
raised
to
constitutional
status
by
kedroff
vs.
st.
nicholas
cathedral.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
no,
sir,
i’m
representing
the
central,
the
petitioner
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
sir?
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
the
local
congregations
bought
the
churches
and
paid
for
it.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
the
title
is
on
the
local
churches.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes,
and
the
decision
of
the
court,
and
that
we
think
correctly,
the
correct
decision
was
that
when
these
local
churches
affiliate
or
joined
the
central
church
that
there
was
an
implied
trust
that
those,
the
church
property,
would
be
use
for
purposes
of
the
denomination.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
i
think
so.
i
think
i
could
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
--
show
you
the
specific
provision
that
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
--
that
there
is
an
applied
rules.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
that’s
what
they
say
that
that
defeated
the
trust.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
the
title
isn’t
involved.
(voice
overlap)
the
thing
that’s
involved
is
his
right
to
occupy
and
use
it
the
same
thing
that
was
involved
in
st.
nicholas
cathedral
and
the
kedroff
case.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
well,
i’m
sure
that
there
is
that
we
can’t
point
out
to
the
court.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
in
the
kedroff
case,
the
kedroff
case
involved
an
act
of
the
legislature
which
in
effect
undertook
to
place
the
property
in
the
hands
of
the
american
branch
of
the
church
relevant
to
moscow
branch
because
they
said/felt
that
the
moscow
branch
had
been
tainted
by
the
communist
of
the
government
that
existed
there
and
was
not
capable
of
managing.
and
that
the
court
held
that
they
couldn’t
do
that
because
under
the
rules
of
the
church
and
under
its
practice
in
the
orthodox
church
that
they
have
the
right
to
occupy
the
cathedral
though
the
cathedral
belong
to
the
local
people
who
went
into
question
what
they
had
the
title
to
it,
to
the
state.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
no
sir.
well,
we
got/have
vietnam
war
and
we
have
statement
on
policy.
there’s
also
one
of
the
things
they
found
fault
with
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
one
of
the
things
the
local
church
has
found
fault
with
was
an
amendment
to
the
church
constitution
that
authorizes
women
to
hold
church
offices.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
well,
i
wouldn’t
think
so.
they
also
found
fault
with
the
central
church
because
the
general
assembly
refused
to
endorse
a
motion
to
--
because
the
general
ssembly
refused
to
endorse
the
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
overcome
the
decision
of
this
court
dealing
with
bible
reading
and
prayer
in
the
public
school.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes,
but
the
last
one
was
the
statement
of
the
general
assembly
on
foreordination.
and
if
you
read
the
statement
of
the
general
assembly
on
foreordination,
it
simply
says
that
in
order
to
be
a
presbyterian,
you
don’t
have
to
believe
that
people
are
condemned
everlasting
death
at
the
time
of
their
birth
and
that
that
is
necessary.
you
don’t
have
to
say
you
can’t
believe
it
if
you
want
to.
it
don’t
deprive
you,
it
don’t
deprive
the
members
of
these
local
churches
from
believing
and
if
they
wanted
to.
they
simply
say
that
if
i
don’t
believe
that
that
i
can
still
be
a
member
in
good
standing
of
the
church.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
just
foreordination.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
well,
we
think
that
this
court
has
held
that
all
of
these
matters
are
matters
for
determination
in
the
church
courts
or
by
the
church
itself
and
not
by
the
civil
court
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
no,
i
think
this
--
i
think
this
court
has
held
that
the
property,
the
only
property
of
the
civil
courts
is
to
take
the
property
in
the
way
that
the
general
church
has
decided
that
it
should
go.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
no,
sir.
(voice
overlap)
the
georgia
court
held
it
and
i
think
it’s
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
i
don’t
think
the
state
courts
have
a
right
to
determine
the
--
where
the
property
goes
but
that’s
a
matter
for
determination
by
the
ecclesiastical
courts.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
it’s
either
16.7
(a)
or
17.7
(a).
the
copy,
i
have
that
16.7
(a)
but
it
is
not
identical
with
this
one.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
16.7.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
no,
sir.
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
no,
that’s
being
suggestive.
i
don’t
think
that
that
is
the
law.
i
think
that
the
law
is
that
after
the
church
has
made
the
determination,
the
duty
of
the
civil
court
then
is
to
enforce
the
decision
of
the
ecclesiastical
courts.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
well,
the
central
church
because
the
local
church
had
a
house
access
to
the
church
courts.
now
these
local
churches
didn’t
see
fit
to
exhaust
any
remedies
in
the
church
court.
the
local
churches
had
a
right
of
appeal
to
the
presbytery.
the
presbytery
appointed
the
commission.
the
evidence
is,
they
refused
to
participate
into
and
they
have
anything
to
do
with.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
it’s
because
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
well,
i
think
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
well
i
think
that
the
georgia
court
--
i
don’t
think
this
been
in
the
appeal
from
that
decision.
but
i
understood,
mr.
justice
white
that
it
has
to
be
whether
or
not
i
felt
that
if
this
decision
have
not
been
made
by
the
georgia
court
that
it
would
have
been
open
for
determinations
by
the
court.
i
think
you’re
bound
by
because
the
court
laid
the
decision
and
there
had
been
no
appeal
from
it.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes.
now
as
they
vote
among
the
local
church
members
and
it
was
unanimous
to
the
extent
of
the
local
church
members
who
were
present
at
that
time,
i
don’t
believe
it.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
unanimous
in
favor
of
withdrawing
from
the
central
church.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
mr.
--
i
have
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
in
this
question
of
property,
we
must
consider
that
the
presbyterian
church
is
a
great
church
composed
of
many
thousands
of
people
who
have
joined
it
over
the
years.
these
local
churches,
when
they
joined,
when
they
have
became
members
of
the
presbyterian
church
in
this
great
volume,
the
church,
when
they
joined
it,
they
placed
their
property
under
the
polity
and
control
of
this
church
and
therefore,
they
didn't
have
to
do
it.
they
could've
remained
the
congregational
church.
they
could've
kept
their
property
but
for
--
because
they
wanted
to
do
just
as
i
did
and
i
happen
to
be
a
presbyterian.
the
justice
i
did
when
i
joined
that
church,
i
put
myself
under
the
polity
and
control
of
the
church
and
therefore
these
local
churches
did
it
with
their
property
at
that
time
and
all
these
churches
--
all
that
the
savannah
presbyterians
has
asked
to
do
is
to
put
a
minister
who
is
a
presbyterian
minister
because
these
churches
no
longer
have
presbyterian
members.
they
renounced
the
church
and
withdrew
from
it.
all
they
asked
to
do
is
to
put
a
presbyterian
minister
in
the
church
to
hold
services
for
any
members
of
this
church
who
might
want
to
come
and
while
the
vote
was
unanimous
about
those
who
were
there,
i
think
the
court
will
take
judicial
cognizance
at
the
very
few
churches
that
have
all
the
members
their
at
any
one
given
day.
and
there
was
no
vote
taken
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
that
was
a
good
vote
but
on
the
other
hand,
one
member
of
the
session
refused
to
follow
the
action
according
to
the
record
in
the
case
because
the
return
was
all
of
the
members
of
the
session
say
one.
and
if
there
was
only
one
member
of
that
church
who
wanted
the
presbyterian
services
yield
in
it,
i
say
he
had
a
right
under
the
constitution
and
the
law
to
have
that
service
alive.
we
think
watson
versus
jones
and
kedroff
have
decided
ever
issue
in
the
--
this
case
in
favor
of
the
respondents.
we
think
watson
versus
jones
and
this
case
are
very
similar
on
the
facts.
both
involved
presbyterian
churches.
watson
involved
the
statement
by
the
church
on
the
question
of
slavery.
this
case
involved
the
statement
of
the
church
on
civil
rights
because
the
evidence
is
that
the
witness
for
the
plaintiffs
said
that
was
the
main
reason
that
they
withdrew
and
in
each
case
the
state
sought
to
try
ecclesiastical
issues
in
the
civil
courts
which
this
court
said
could
not
be
done.
the
churches
in
this
country
have
lived
under
watson
versus
jones
for
a
hundred
years
and
with
kedroff
for
15
years
with
no
injury
to
our
religious
life.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
well,
then
--
this
court
if
it
reaches
that
conclusion
should
instruct
the
georgia
supreme
court
to
deny
the
relief
sought
by
the
plaintiffs
and
give
the
relief
sought
by
the
defendants
which
would
give
them
possession
of
the
church
property
for
the
purposes
of
conducting
services
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
the
claim
would
rest
on
the
implied
trust
that
is
recognized
in
the
similar
presbyterian
church
in
watson
versus
jones.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yeah.
but
the
courts
have
held
both
in
kedroff
and
in
watson
versus
jones
that
after
the
church
tribunal
has
made
its
determination,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
civil
courts
to
throw
the
property
in
the
direction
that
the
ecclesiastical
courts
have
indicated.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
this
--
simply
that
the
court
would
issue
an
order
that
the
presbyterian
church,
the
presbytery
of
savannah
should
have
possession
of
the
church
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
this
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes
sir.
by
that,
all
of
the
courts
have
held
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
civil
court
when
property
rights
are
involved
for
the
civil
courts
to
enforce
the
decision
of
the
ecclesiastical
court.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
there
is
no
--
nothing
in
the
church
law
that
deals
directly
with
the
disposition
of
the
property
of
the
local
churches
of
the
central
church
(inaudible).
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
the
forward
--
the
making
women
eligible
to
hold
church
office
and
that
was
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
church,
regular
devoted
by
the
requisite
dome
of
presbyteries
and
there's
no
attack
upon
the
adoption
of
that
constitutional
amendment.
all
the
rest
of
them
are
merely
statements
of
position
and
there's
nothing
in
the
church,
book
of
church
order.
there's
nothing
in
the
evidence
in
this
case.
there's
nothing
in
the
case
to
say
that
i
as
a
presbyterian
have
to
believe
anyone
of
those
to
remain
a
member
in
good
standing
in
the
church.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
i
don't
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
i
don't
think
is
an
in
esse
deliverance.
this
is
merely
if
you
will
read
the
statements
and
they
are
all
in
the
record
that
they
complained
off.
if
you'll
--
part
of
it
is
sunday
school
literature.
but
if
you
will
read
the
statement
you
will
find
that
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
statement
of
the
position
of
this
general
assembly,
the
next
general
assembly
could
have
an
entirely
different
position
and
there's
nothing
in
it
that
says
that
any
member
of
the
church
has
to
believe
it
or
has
to
act
on
it.
it
simply
--
its
no
more
than
a
deliverance
of
a
minister
whom
--
and
by
-
and
the
church
might
preach
a
sermon
with
which
he
didn't
agree.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
frequently.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
presbyterian
church
in
the
united
states,
the
petitioner,
is
a
hierarchical
church,
sometimes
called
the
southern
presbyterian
church.
the
first
step
in
the
church
government
is
the
“session”,
composed
of
ruling
elders
and
the
pastor
of
the
local
church.
the
next
is
the
“presbyterian”,
which
is
composed
of
representatives
of
local
churches
in
a
geographical
area
and
also
the
ministers
from
those
churches.
under
the
form
of
government
of
this
church,
a
pastor
of
a
local
church
is
not
a
member
of
the
local
church
but
is
a
member
of
the
presbyterian.
the
next
is
the
“senate”,
which
generally
but
not
always
corresponds
to
state
lines
and
which
is
composed
of
representatives
of
the
local
churches
together
with
the
ministers
in
the
included
presbyterians.
next
is
the
“general
assembly”,
which
is
composed
of
representatives
of
presbyterians,
divided
equally
between
ministers
and
laymen.
this
also
constitutes
the
courts
of
each
government
church;
the
general
assembly
being
the
highest
court
in
the
denomination.
in
april
of
1966,
the
congregation
of
two
local
churches
of
this
church
voted
to
savor
all
connections
will
and
remove
themselves
from
all
ecclesiastical
control,
jurisdiction
and
oversight
of
the
presbyterian
church
in
the
united
states
and
so
notified
the
presbytery
of
savannah.
the
savannah
presbytery
then
appointed
an
administrative
commission
under
the
law
of
the
church
with
full
authority
to
act
on
the
premises
and
with
special
instructions
to
visit
the
ruling
elders
of
each
church
-
the
ruling
elders
constituting
the
session,
which
as
i
have
said
is
the
governing
body
of
the
local
church.
after
each
elder
in
each
church
saved
one,
reaffirmed
the
action
and
after
the
pastor
of
each
church
had
reaffirmed
his
renunciation
of
the
presbyterian
church
in
the
united
states,
the
commission,
by
a
resolution,
that’s
the
administrative
commission
of
the
presbyterian,
by
resolution
declared
the
pulpit
of
these
church
to
be
vacant
because
administers
had
savored
all
the
connections
with
the
church
and
assume
the
regional
jurisdiction
over
these
local
churches
in
accordance
with
the
book
of
church
order
which
is
part
of
the
record
in
this
case
and
declared
that
commission’s
intention
to
secure
ministers
to
provided
regular
services
of
worship
in
the
sanctuaries
of
each
of
the
two
local
churches
for
those
members
who
wish
to
continue
their
membership
and
communion
with
the
general
church.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
we
will
cover
that
but
the
decision
of
the
georgia
supreme
court
we
think
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
on
the
basis
of
the
implied
trust.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
no,
sir,
but
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
no,
sir.
when
you
join
the
church,
the
book
of
church
order
contains
the
procedure
under
which
the
local
churches
are
maintained.
the
book
of
church
order
says
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
i
don’t
think
it
says
anything
about
the
property
but
it
does
say
who
has
the
use
and
the
right
to
occupy
the
church
when
the
church
ceases
to
function
as
a
church
in
the
denomination.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
that’s
in
book
of
church
order,
section
16-7(a)
or
it
may
7(d).
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
it’s
not
in
the
appendix.
it’s
in
the
record.
the
book
of
church
order
is
a
part
of
the
record
that
is
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
it
is
not
in
the
printed
record.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
no,
sir,
it
is
not
been
quoted
in
the
brief
but
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
well,
the
decision
in
the
statement
in
the
church
law
is
that
when
a
local
church
ceases
to
function
as
a
church;
that
the
property
then
is
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
general
church
and
our
position
is,
that
this
local
church
has
ceased
to
function.
the
finding
of
the
administrative
commission
was
that
one
elder
did
not
constitute
the
session;
that
there
was
no
session
to
govern
the
church
and
that
it
had
no
minister.
and
that
therefore,
the
administrative
commission
would
take
the
occupancy
and
use
of
the
property
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
the
dedication
of
the
property
which
came
about
when
the
local
churches
affiliated
with
the
general
church.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
it’s
in
the
record
–
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
it’s
in
the
book
itself.
it’s
a
part
of
the
record.
the
book
of
church
order
is
a
part
of
the
record.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes,
i’ll
be
happy
to
do
that.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
i
think
it
was
from
the
circumstances
of
acquisition
and
also
from
the
general
politic
of
the
church
that
has
existed
for
a
hundred
years.
i
think
it
was
also
the
decision
in
--
had
been
decided
in
the
numerous
other
jurisdictions
that
this
was
the
politic
of
the
presbyterian
church
and
we
have
cited
those
in
our
brief.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
politic
is
the
laws
and
the
practices
of
the
church.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
the
state
court
has
founded
and
the
local
court,
local
state
court
founded
and
the
respondents
have
never
questioned.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
they
don’t
question
it
here.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
indeed
the
judge
suggesting
in
a
possible
way,
we
could
leave
it
to
the
church
government
itself.
i
think
it’s
been
left
to
the
church
government
because
the
church
government,
the
administrative
commission
of
the
presbyterian,
which
was
opponent
in
the
accordance
with
the
book
of
church
order
which
is
a
constitution
of
the
government
of
the
church
made
this
finding.
and
the
local
churches
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
no.
they
found
first
the
administrative
commission
of
the
presbyterian,
was
appointed
to
go
and
see
these
churches
and
to
find
out/discuss
with
them
the
differences
at
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
withdrawn?
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
secede
--
two
churches
on
savannah.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
only
two.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
that’s
as
far
as
the
records
show
and
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
two
churches
and
the
rest
of
the
denomination.
but
the
church
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
it’s
over
--
we
think
it’s
over
religious
matters.
the
court
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes,
while
here’s
what
the
differences
were
-
first
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
the
first
was
a
statement
in
some
sunday
school
literature
about
civil
disobedience.
the
evidence
was
on
the
trial
of
the
case
and
the
local
churches
didn’t
even
use
the
sunday
school
literature
and
what
required
to
use
it.
there
was
also
a
statement
by
the
general
assembly
of
the
church
on
civil
disobedience
as
a
final
resort
to
secure
individuals
their
rights.
that
statement
on
civil
disobedience
is
in
the
record;
the
summation
of
it
is
on
page
58.
i
think
it’s
relatively
mild
statement
of
it.
it
ends
up
by
saying
that
it
regard
civil
disobedience
as
a
measure
of
last
resort,
to
be
employed
only
on
circumstances
otherwise
herein
mediatable
need.
and
then
the
exercise
of
which,
the
whole
concept
of
law
is
not
denied
but
affirmed.
and
to
continue
the
support
and
regard
with
compassion,
those
who
practice
civil
disobedience
when
no
legal
recourse
has
been
left
open
to
them
and
you
act
in
christian
conscience
and
a
legions
to
almighty
god.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes,
sir.
they
are
submitted
to
the
jury
as
whether
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes,
the
jury
passed
on
that.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
they
held
that
it
was
a
departure
from
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
civil
disobedience
was
a
departure
from
the
tenets
and
doctrines
of
the
presbyterian
church
in
the
united
states
as
they
existed
in
1861.
and
as
they
existed
in
1890,
when
one
of
these
local
churches
affiliated
with,
and
that
the
holding
was,
is
apparently
they
adopted
the
english
rule
that
was
rejected
by
this
court
on
watson
vs.
jones
and
said
“that
you
couldn’t
change
the
doctrine
that
existed
in
1861
of
the
time
when
the
church
affiliations
because
of
--
they
were
bound
by.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
they
decided
in
favor
of
the
two
local
churches
and
the
court.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes,
sir
and
the
court
made
a
statement
that
the
state
went
on
the
civil
disobedience,
this
is
a
court
in
the
georgia
supreme
court,
is
an
absolute
defiance
of
law
on
order
and
this
is
the
road
to
anarchy.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
that’s
the
issue.
and
our
contention
is,
that
under
the
first
amendment
as
construed
in
watson
vs.
jones
and
in
kedroff
vs.
st.
nicholas
cathedral
that
this
court
has
held
that
under
the
free
exercise
and
establishment
clauses
of
the
first
amendment
that
the
civil
courts
do
not
have
a
right
to
inquire
into
those
matters
but
those
matters
are
for
decision
by
the
ecclesiastic
courts.
and
that
is
the
question
and
the
issue
that
we
think
it’s
been
in
disposed
of
by
watson
vs.
jones
which
was
not
decided
on
constitutional
grounds
originally
but
we
believed
was
raised
to
constitutional
status
by
kedroff
vs.
st.
nicholas
cathedral.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
no,
sir,
i’m
representing
the
central,
the
petitioner
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
sir?
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
the
local
congregations
bought
the
churches
and
paid
for
it.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
the
title
is
on
the
local
churches.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes,
and
the
decision
of
the
court,
and
that
we
think
correctly,
the
correct
decision
was
that
when
these
local
churches
affiliate
or
joined
the
central
church
that
there
was
an
implied
trust
that
those,
the
church
property,
would
be
use
for
purposes
of
the
denomination.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
i
think
so.
i
think
i
could
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
--
show
you
the
specific
provision
that
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
--
that
there
is
an
applied
rules.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
that’s
what
they
say
that
that
defeated
the
trust.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
the
title
isn’t
involved.
(voice
overlap)
the
thing
that’s
involved
is
his
right
to
occupy
and
use
it
the
same
thing
that
was
involved
in
st.
nicholas
cathedral
and
the
kedroff
case.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
well,
i’m
sure
that
there
is
that
we
can’t
point
out
to
the
court.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
the
court
of
appeals
of
new
york
in
the
kedroff
case,
the
kedroff
case
involved
an
act
of
the
legislature
which
in
effect
undertook
to
place
the
property
in
the
hands
of
the
american
branch
of
the
church
relevant
to
moscow
branch
because
they
said/felt
that
the
moscow
branch
had
been
tainted
by
the
communist
of
the
government
that
existed
there
and
was
not
capable
of
managing.
and
that
the
court
held
that
they
couldn’t
do
that
because
under
the
rules
of
the
church
and
under
its
practice
in
the
orthodox
church
that
they
have
the
right
to
occupy
the
cathedral
though
the
cathedral
belong
to
the
local
people
who
went
into
question
what
they
had
the
title
to
it,
to
the
state.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
no
sir.
well,
we
got/have
vietnam
war
and
we
have
statement
on
policy.
there’s
also
one
of
the
things
they
found
fault
with
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
one
of
the
things
the
local
church
has
found
fault
with
was
an
amendment
to
the
church
constitution
that
authorizes
women
to
hold
church
offices.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
well,
i
wouldn’t
think
so.
they
also
found
fault
with
the
central
church
because
the
general
assembly
refused
to
endorse
a
motion
to
--
because
the
general
ssembly
refused
to
endorse
the
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
overcome
the
decision
of
this
court
dealing
with
bible
reading
and
prayer
in
the
public
school.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes,
but
the
last
one
was
the
statement
of
the
general
assembly
on
foreordination.
and
if
you
read
the
statement
of
the
general
assembly
on
foreordination,
it
simply
says
that
in
order
to
be
a
presbyterian,
you
don’t
have
to
believe
that
people
are
condemned
everlasting
death
at
the
time
of
their
birth
and
that
that
is
necessary.
you
don’t
have
to
say
you
can’t
believe
it
if
you
want
to.
it
don’t
deprive
you,
it
don’t
deprive
the
members
of
these
local
churches
from
believing
and
if
they
wanted
to.
they
simply
say
that
if
i
don’t
believe
that
that
i
can
still
be
a
member
in
good
standing
of
the
church.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
just
foreordination.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
well,
we
think
that
this
court
has
held
that
all
of
these
matters
are
matters
for
determination
in
the
church
courts
or
by
the
church
itself
and
not
by
the
civil
court
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
no,
i
think
this
--
i
think
this
court
has
held
that
the
property,
the
only
property
of
the
civil
courts
is
to
take
the
property
in
the
way
that
the
general
church
has
decided
that
it
should
go.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
no,
sir.
(voice
overlap)
the
georgia
court
held
it
and
i
think
it’s
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
i
don’t
think
the
state
courts
have
a
right
to
determine
the
--
where
the
property
goes
but
that’s
a
matter
for
determination
by
the
ecclesiastical
courts.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
it’s
either
16.7
(a)
or
17.7
(a).
the
copy,
i
have
that
16.7
(a)
but
it
is
not
identical
with
this
one.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
16.7.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
no,
sir.
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
no,
that’s
being
suggestive.
i
don’t
think
that
that
is
the
law.
i
think
that
the
law
is
that
after
the
church
has
made
the
determination,
the
duty
of
the
civil
court
then
is
to
enforce
the
decision
of
the
ecclesiastical
courts.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
well,
the
central
church
because
the
local
church
had
a
house
access
to
the
church
courts.
now
these
local
churches
didn’t
see
fit
to
exhaust
any
remedies
in
the
church
court.
the
local
churches
had
a
right
of
appeal
to
the
presbytery.
the
presbytery
appointed
the
commission.
the
evidence
is,
they
refused
to
participate
into
and
they
have
anything
to
do
with.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
it’s
because
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
well,
i
think
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
well
i
think
that
the
georgia
court
--
i
don’t
think
this
been
in
the
appeal
from
that
decision.
but
i
understood,
mr.
justice
white
that
it
has
to
be
whether
or
not
i
felt
that
if
this
decision
have
not
been
made
by
the
georgia
court
that
it
would
have
been
open
for
determinations
by
the
court.
i
think
you’re
bound
by
because
the
court
laid
the
decision
and
there
had
been
no
appeal
from
it.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes.
now
as
they
vote
among
the
local
church
members
and
it
was
unanimous
to
the
extent
of
the
local
church
members
who
were
present
at
that
time,
i
don’t
believe
it.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
unanimous
in
favor
of
withdrawing
from
the
central
church.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
mr.
--
i
have
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
in
this
question
of
property,
we
must
consider
that
the
presbyterian
church
is
a
great
church
composed
of
many
thousands
of
people
who
have
joined
it
over
the
years.
these
local
churches,
when
they
joined,
when
they
have
became
members
of
the
presbyterian
church
in
this
great
volume,
the
church,
when
they
joined
it,
they
placed
their
property
under
the
polity
and
control
of
this
church
and
therefore,
they
didn't
have
to
do
it.
they
could've
remained
the
congregational
church.
they
could've
kept
their
property
but
for
--
because
they
wanted
to
do
just
as
i
did
and
i
happen
to
be
a
presbyterian.
the
justice
i
did
when
i
joined
that
church,
i
put
myself
under
the
polity
and
control
of
the
church
and
therefore
these
local
churches
did
it
with
their
property
at
that
time
and
all
these
churches
--
all
that
the
savannah
presbyterians
has
asked
to
do
is
to
put
a
minister
who
is
a
presbyterian
minister
because
these
churches
no
longer
have
presbyterian
members.
they
renounced
the
church
and
withdrew
from
it.
all
they
asked
to
do
is
to
put
a
presbyterian
minister
in
the
church
to
hold
services
for
any
members
of
this
church
who
might
want
to
come
and
while
the
vote
was
unanimous
about
those
who
were
there,
i
think
the
court
will
take
judicial
cognizance
at
the
very
few
churches
that
have
all
the
members
their
at
any
one
given
day.
and
there
was
no
vote
taken
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
that
was
a
good
vote
but
on
the
other
hand,
one
member
of
the
session
refused
to
follow
the
action
according
to
the
record
in
the
case
because
the
return
was
all
of
the
members
of
the
session
say
one.
and
if
there
was
only
one
member
of
that
church
who
wanted
the
presbyterian
services
yield
in
it,
i
say
he
had
a
right
under
the
constitution
and
the
law
to
have
that
service
alive.
we
think
watson
versus
jones
and
kedroff
have
decided
ever
issue
in
the
--
this
case
in
favor
of
the
respondents.
we
think
watson
versus
jones
and
this
case
are
very
similar
on
the
facts.
both
involved
presbyterian
churches.
watson
involved
the
statement
by
the
church
on
the
question
of
slavery.
this
case
involved
the
statement
of
the
church
on
civil
rights
because
the
evidence
is
that
the
witness
for
the
plaintiffs
said
that
was
the
main
reason
that
they
withdrew
and
in
each
case
the
state
sought
to
try
ecclesiastical
issues
in
the
civil
courts
which
this
court
said
could
not
be
done.
the
churches
in
this
country
have
lived
under
watson
versus
jones
for
a
hundred
years
and
with
kedroff
for
15
years
with
no
injury
to
our
religious
life.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
well,
then
--
this
court
if
it
reaches
that
conclusion
should
instruct
the
georgia
supreme
court
to
deny
the
relief
sought
by
the
plaintiffs
and
give
the
relief
sought
by
the
defendants
which
would
give
them
possession
of
the
church
property
for
the
purposes
of
conducting
services
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
the
claim
would
rest
on
the
implied
trust
that
is
recognized
in
the
similar
presbyterian
church
in
watson
versus
jones.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yeah.
but
the
courts
have
held
both
in
kedroff
and
in
watson
versus
jones
that
after
the
church
tribunal
has
made
its
determination,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
civil
courts
to
throw
the
property
in
the
direction
that
the
ecclesiastical
courts
have
indicated.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
this
--
simply
that
the
court
would
issue
an
order
that
the
presbyterian
church,
the
presbytery
of
savannah
should
have
possession
of
the
church
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
this
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
yes
sir.
by
that,
all
of
the
courts
have
held
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
civil
court
when
property
rights
are
involved
for
the
civil
courts
to
enforce
the
decision
of
the
ecclesiastical
court.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
there
is
no
--
nothing
in
the
church
law
that
deals
directly
with
the
disposition
of
the
property
of
the
local
churches
of
the
central
church
(inaudible).
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
the
forward
--
the
making
women
eligible
to
hold
church
office
and
that
was
an
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
church,
regular
devoted
by
the
requisite
dome
of
presbyteries
and
there's
no
attack
upon
the
adoption
of
that
constitutional
amendment.
all
the
rest
of
them
are
merely
statements
of
position
and
there's
nothing
in
the
church,
book
of
church
order.
there's
nothing
in
the
evidence
in
this
case.
there's
nothing
in
the
case
to
say
that
i
as
a
presbyterian
have
to
believe
anyone
of
those
to
remain
a
member
in
good
standing
in
the
church.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
i
don't
--
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
i
don't
think
is
an
in
esse
deliverance.
this
is
merely
if
you
will
read
the
statements
and
they
are
all
in
the
record
that
they
complained
off.
if
you'll
--
part
of
it
is
sunday
school
literature.
but
if
you
will
read
the
statement
you
will
find
that
it
is
nothing
more
than
a
statement
of
the
position
of
this
general
assembly,
the
next
general
assembly
could
have
an
entirely
different
position
and
there's
nothing
in
it
that
says
that
any
member
of
the
church
has
to
believe
it
or
has
to
act
on
it.
it
simply
--
its
no
more
than
a
deliverance
of
a
minister
whom
--
and
by
-
and
the
church
might
preach
a
sermon
with
which
he
didn't
agree.
mr.
charles
l.
gowen
frequently.
thank
you.
