you
state
on

18
of
your
brief
that
the
civil
courts
have
power
to
overwrite
the
decision
of
an
ecclesiastical
authority
where
to
enforce
its
decision,
first
would
be
offensive
to
peace
and
order.
second,
would
approve
an
arbitrary
or
ultra
vires
act
or
third,
would
be
repugnant
to
the
principle
of
equity.
we
have
a
lot
of
controversies
in
churches,
taking
birth
control,
how
would
you
--
how
would
your
theory
go
about
resolving
--
in
birth
control
dispute
in
the
church?

-well,
you're
talking
about
offensive
to
peace
and
good
order,
arbitrary
or
ultra
vires
or
repugnant
to
the
principles
of
equity.
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
i
have
read
our
prior
decisions,
i
had
--
i
don't
see
them
--
the
relevancy
of
those
three
standards
to
watson,
to
kendrick.
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
will
agree
once
you
--
that
it
is
better
if
possible,
in
view
of
their
first
amendment
for
this
court
not
to
look
into
anything
in
connection
with
dogmas
unless
it
is
imperatively
required
by
some
law.
