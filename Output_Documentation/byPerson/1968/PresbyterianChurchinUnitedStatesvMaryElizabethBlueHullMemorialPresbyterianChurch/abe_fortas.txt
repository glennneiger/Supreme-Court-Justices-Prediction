there
was
also
something
about
foreordination.
justice
abe
fortas
what’s
your
basis
for
civil
courts
in
this
country
accepting
a
determination
as
to
property
rights
or
right
of
that
by
church
courts
that
it
can’t
be
because
it
is
a
canon
law
or
a
church
law.
it’s
got
to
be
because
it
is
relevant
to
some
common-law
principle
that
we
can
entertain
in
civil
courts,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don’t
know
of
anything
in
our
constitutional
system
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
would
think
to
what
you
say.
i
was
hoping
that
you
would
say
that
in
this
case,
the
purposes
of
this
case,
as
to
whether
the
georgia
court’s
decision
on
the
existence
of
an
implied
trust
should
be
taken
by
this
court.
apparently,
you
don’t
say
that.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
you,
is
this
argument
addressed
to
a
proposition
that
there
was
no
implied
trust?
justice
abe
fortas
i
want
to
be
clear
about
one
thing.
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
i
was
but
i'd
like
to
get
your
view
on
it.
you
do
not
contest
the
finding
of
the
conclusion
of
the
court
below
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
there
was
an
implied
trust.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
--
the
terms
of
that
implied
trust
are
that
this
property
will
be
used
as
part
of
and
subject
to
the
mechanism
of
the
church
and
the
central
direction
and
guidance
of
the
church
and
the
church
discipline.
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
have
as
i
see
it,
and
your
case
comes
down
to
two
points.
one,
assuming
that
there
is
an
implied
trust
which
you
--
are
going
to.
two,
is
that
trust
dependent
upon
a
maintenance
of
the
church
polity
at
the
time
the
trust
was
cleared
and
mainly
as
of
the
time
of
the
acquisition
of
the
properties
by
the
local
church.
justice
abe
fortas
but
your
point
is,
as
i
understand
it,
that
you
in
effect
agree
that
unless
the
court
properly
--
a
court
properly
finds
that
there
has
been
a
departure
from
the
church
dogma
or
church
polity
as
comparing
the
present
with
the
time
of
the
acquisition
of
the
property
by
the
local
church,
unless
there
has
been
a
departure
by
the
central
church
in
church
dogma
or
polity,
then
you
agree
that
the
--
you're
wrong
and
the
central
church
is
right.
and
that
the
central
church
is
entitled
with
the
property.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
your
case
really
depends
as
i
see
it
upon
two
questions.
one,
did
the
court
below
properly
go
into
--
did
they
have
any
business
going
into
the
question
that
you
put.
and
second,
was
it
properly
decided
so
that
when
you
look
at
it
from
that
point
of
view,
your
whole
case
depends
not
on
property
law
in
the
common
law
sense
but
upon
the
question
of
a
church
dogma.
justice
abe
fortas
--
this
question
please.
one
of
the
issues
that
was
tendered
to
the
jury,
was
your
contention
that
the
central
church
had
departed
from
original
dogma
on
the
doctrine
of
"for
ordinations,"
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
that
was
one
of
the
issues
that
you
tendered.
now,
if
the
jury
had
disbelieved
you
on
everything
else,
if
they
had
disbelieved
you
on
everything
else
they
might
still
have
come
in
with
the
verdict
on
your
behalf
because
they
believe
it
--
that
the
church,
the
central
church
had
departed
from
the
doctrine
of
“for
ordinations”
as
an
existent
as
of
the
time
that
these
properties
were
acquired
that
is
the
thrust
of
the
instruction
under
which
the
jury
was
operating,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
did
encompassed
to
all
of
them
but
it's
a
--
the
lower
court
said
if
you
find
that
there
has
been
a
departure
from
church
dogma
as
of
the
time
of
acquisition,
then
you
will
decide
for
the
plaintiffs,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
jury
might
have
decided
this
case
on
the
basis
of
a
departure
by
the
central
church
in
respect
of
the
doctrine
of
“for
ordination.”
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
--
was
one
of
your
charges
and
one
other
things
that
you
--
on
which
you
submitted
proof,
am
i
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
there
was
also
something
about
foreordination.
justice
abe
fortas
what’s
your
basis
for
civil
courts
in
this
country
accepting
a
determination
as
to
property
rights
or
right
of
that
by
church
courts
that
it
can’t
be
because
it
is
a
canon
law
or
a
church
law.
it’s
got
to
be
because
it
is
relevant
to
some
common-law
principle
that
we
can
entertain
in
civil
courts,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
i
don’t
know
of
anything
in
our
constitutional
system
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
would
think
to
what
you
say.
i
was
hoping
that
you
would
say
that
in
this
case,
the
purposes
of
this
case,
as
to
whether
the
georgia
court’s
decision
on
the
existence
of
an
implied
trust
should
be
taken
by
this
court.
apparently,
you
don’t
say
that.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
you,
is
this
argument
addressed
to
a
proposition
that
there
was
no
implied
trust?
justice
abe
fortas
i
want
to
be
clear
about
one
thing.
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
i
was
but
i'd
like
to
get
your
view
on
it.
you
do
not
contest
the
finding
of
the
conclusion
of
the
court
below
--
justice
abe
fortas
i
think
there
was
an
implied
trust.
justice
abe
fortas
and
that
--
the
terms
of
that
implied
trust
are
that
this
property
will
be
used
as
part
of
and
subject
to
the
mechanism
of
the
church
and
the
central
direction
and
guidance
of
the
church
and
the
church
discipline.
justice
abe
fortas
well
you
have
as
i
see
it,
and
your
case
comes
down
to
two
points.
one,
assuming
that
there
is
an
implied
trust
which
you
--
are
going
to.
two,
is
that
trust
dependent
upon
a
maintenance
of
the
church
polity
at
the
time
the
trust
was
cleared
and
mainly
as
of
the
time
of
the
acquisition
of
the
properties
by
the
local
church.
justice
abe
fortas
but
your
point
is,
as
i
understand
it,
that
you
in
effect
agree
that
unless
the
court
properly
--
a
court
properly
finds
that
there
has
been
a
departure
from
the
church
dogma
or
church
polity
as
comparing
the
present
with
the
time
of
the
acquisition
of
the
property
by
the
local
church,
unless
there
has
been
a
departure
by
the
central
church
in
church
dogma
or
polity,
then
you
agree
that
the
--
you're
wrong
and
the
central
church
is
right.
and
that
the
central
church
is
entitled
with
the
property.
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
your
case
really
depends
as
i
see
it
upon
two
questions.
one,
did
the
court
below
properly
go
into
--
did
they
have
any
business
going
into
the
question
that
you
put.
and
second,
was
it
properly
decided
so
that
when
you
look
at
it
from
that
point
of
view,
your
whole
case
depends
not
on
property
law
in
the
common
law
sense
but
upon
the
question
of
a
church
dogma.
justice
abe
fortas
--
this
question
please.
one
of
the
issues
that
was
tendered
to
the
jury,
was
your
contention
that
the
central
church
had
departed
from
original
dogma
on
the
doctrine
of
"for
ordinations,"
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
that
was
one
of
the
issues
that
you
tendered.
now,
if
the
jury
had
disbelieved
you
on
everything
else,
if
they
had
disbelieved
you
on
everything
else
they
might
still
have
come
in
with
the
verdict
on
your
behalf
because
they
believe
it
--
that
the
church,
the
central
church
had
departed
from
the
doctrine
of
“for
ordinations”
as
an
existent
as
of
the
time
that
these
properties
were
acquired
that
is
the
thrust
of
the
instruction
under
which
the
jury
was
operating,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
abe
fortas
and
it
did
encompassed
to
all
of
them
but
it's
a
--
the
lower
court
said
if
you
find
that
there
has
been
a
departure
from
church
dogma
as
of
the
time
of
acquisition,
then
you
will
decide
for
the
plaintiffs,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
and
the
jury
might
have
decided
this
case
on
the
basis
of
a
departure
by
the
central
church
in
respect
of
the
doctrine
of
“for
ordination.”
justice
abe
fortas
is
that
--
was
one
of
your
charges
and
one
other
things
that
you
--
on
which
you
submitted
proof,
am
i
correct?
