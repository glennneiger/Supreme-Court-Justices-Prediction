stewart
you
are
the
better
authority,
mapp

justice
potter
stewart
mapp
against
ohio
is
pretty
good
authority
to
you.
justice
potter
stewart
when
was
this
confession?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
mean
what
month
and
year.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
of
that
time,
nobody
had
ever
decided
that
he
did
have
a
right
to
a
lawyer,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
these
tapes
are
part
of
the
record
in
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
this
second
confession
that
appears
on,
beginning
on
page
51
of
the
appendix,
reproduced
in
actual
handwriting,
have
you
got
to
this
one
yet
in
your
--?
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
chronicle?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
down
to
the
second
or
third
one
now?
justice
potter
stewart
just
--
first
of
all,
is
this
the
handwriting
of
the
petitioner?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
state
trooper's.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
do
this
signature
of
the
petitioner
which
seemed
to
be
different.
that's
state
trooper's
handwriting
not
the
petitioner.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
at
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
what
ground
did
he
object?
justice
potter
stewart
sure.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
exceptions
i
guess
are
mr.
john
l.
nelson
and
mr.
e.
o
moon,
possible
exceptions
as
you
call
them,
page
17.
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
would
be
the
two
what
you
call
possible
exceptions
to
the,
is
that
right?
if
i
got
the
right
too?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
--
now
look
a
mr.
moon,
the
next
man,
mr.
e.
o.
moon.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
do
you
claim
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
those
are
two
exceptions.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
alright.
i
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
the
law
of
alabama
at
that
time
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
lawyer
at
the
time
he's
being
interrogated
by
the
police?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
of
1965?
justice
potter
stewart
'64.
justice
potter
stewart
prior
to
either
one.
justice
potter
stewart
this
captain
williams
said
that
he
was
told
the
petitioner
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
lawyer
by
the
time
of
his
being
--
the
time
he's
being
interrogated?
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
the
law
of
alabama?
justice
potter
stewart
because
it
wasn't
the
law
generally,
it
wasn't
any
constitutional
requirement.
justice
potter
stewart
i
beg
your
pardon?
justice
potter
stewart
she
would
--
was
she
an
eyewitness?
justice
potter
stewart
did
she
testify
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
i
hadn't
understood
that
from
the
briefs
but
you
know
more
about
the
case.
justice
potter
stewart
the
statement
on
page
5
of
the
petitioner's
brief
is
this.
after
they
were
stopped
by
hays
and
prior
to
the
shooting
and
sticking,
boulden
had
told
amber
not
to
run
and
she
did.
hence
she
was
not
an
eyewitness
when
hays
met
his
death.
that's
just
as
counsel
statement.
the
person
on
top
of
page
5.
justice
potter
stewart
the
witherspoon
opinion,
as
i
understand
it,
did
however
didn't
really
rely
much
on
the
words
of
the
statute,
but
rather
what
actually
happened
in
the
voir
dire
of
the
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
would
be
the
test
in
any
case
under
the
witherspoon
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
happened
in
the
qualifying
of
the
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
often
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
record
will
show
that
the
actual
voir
dire
of
the
jury
of
the
words
of
the
statute
weren't
very
carefully
followed.
now
in
this
case,
according
to
the
printed
appendix
here,
what
was
asked
was
just
a
statutory
language.
do
you
have
a
fixed
opinion
capital
punishment,
almost
in
each
one
of
these
16
cases,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
even
if
it
meant
to
each
one
of
them
exactly
what
you
say
it
means
to
you
and
means
to
noah
webster?
isn't
it
perfectly
possible
that
a
person
can
have
a
fixed
opinion
against
capital
punishment
that
is
he
would
vote
against
it
if
he
were
a
legislator
or
try
to
get
the
legislature
to
abolish
it
if
he
were
the
governor?
but
in
the
mean
time,
he
would
follow
his
duty
as
a
jury
--
as
a
juror.
certainly,
i
suppose
there
are
judges,
many
judges
who
have
a
fixed
opinion
against
capital
punishment
as
a
matter
of
policy
and
as
citizens
but
who
do
their
duty
and
the
sentence
people
to
death
when
that's
what
their
duty
require.
justice
potter
stewart
well
no,
he
wouldn't
change
his
mind.
he'd
be
against
it
as
a
citizen
and
as
a
matter
of
policy.
a
lot
of
people
--
we
have
provision,
national
provisions,
they
had
a
fixed
opinion
against
it.
they
thought
it
was
silly,
unwise
law
but
as
jurors
they
would
follow
the
directions
of
the
court
and
convict
people
for
violating
the
provision
laws.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
asked
of
two
of
the
jurors.
it
was
asked
to
two
of
the
jurors,
wasn't
it?
on
page
17,
mr.
nelson
and
mr.
moon.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
wasn't
to
any
of
the
others.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
what
according
to
the
most
recent
evidence
i've
seen,
a
majority
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
are
against
capital
punishment
as
a
matter
of
principle
or
policy.
but
this
doesn't
mean
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
carry
out
their
duties
as
jurors,
does
it,
or
to
follow
the
instructions
of
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
was
murdered
and
she
was
not
an
eyewitness
to
it.
justice
potter
stewart
how
old
was
he?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
he
said
he
did.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
girl
said
he
did.
justice
potter
stewart
did
he
testify?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
admitted
the
killing
of
the
man.
justice
potter
stewart
this
seems
to
be
the
habeas
corpus
hearing,
mostly
in
the
appendix,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
the
better
authority,
mapp
against
ohio.
justice
potter
stewart
mapp
against
ohio
is
pretty
good
authority
to
you.
justice
potter
stewart
when
was
this
confession?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
mean
what
month
and
year.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
as
of
that
time,
nobody
had
ever
decided
that
he
did
have
a
right
to
a
lawyer,
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
these
tapes
are
part
of
the
record
in
this
court?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
this
second
confession
that
appears
on,
beginning
on
page
51
of
the
appendix,
reproduced
in
actual
handwriting,
have
you
got
to
this
one
yet
in
your
--?
justice
potter
stewart
in
your
chronicle?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
you're
down
to
the
second
or
third
one
now?
justice
potter
stewart
just
--
first
of
all,
is
this
the
handwriting
of
the
petitioner?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
state
trooper's.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
do
this
signature
of
the
petitioner
which
seemed
to
be
different.
that's
state
trooper's
handwriting
not
the
petitioner.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
not
at
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
what
ground
did
he
object?
justice
potter
stewart
sure.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
the
exceptions
i
guess
are
mr.
john
l.
nelson
and
mr.
e.
o
moon,
possible
exceptions
as
you
call
them,
page
17.
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
would
be
the
two
what
you
call
possible
exceptions
to
the,
is
that
right?
if
i
got
the
right
too?
justice
potter
stewart
well
now
--
now
look
a
mr.
moon,
the
next
man,
mr.
e.
o.
moon.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
do
you
claim
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
those
are
two
exceptions.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
alright.
i
just
--
justice
potter
stewart
was
that
the
law
of
alabama
at
that
time
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
lawyer
at
the
time
he's
being
interrogated
by

police?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice

1965?
justice
potter
stewart

justice
potter
stewart
prior
to
either
one.
justice
potter

this
captain
williams
said
that
he
was
told
the
petitioner
that
he
was

because
it

it

justice

stewart
i
beg

pardon?
justice
potter
stewart
she
would
--
was
she
an

justice
potter
stewart
did
she
testify
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
i
hadn't
understood
that
from
the
briefs
but
you
know
more
about
the
case.
justice
potter
stewart
the
statement
on
page
5
of
the

is
this.

however

on

what

the

will
show
that

of
the

of

weren't
very
carefully

now
in
