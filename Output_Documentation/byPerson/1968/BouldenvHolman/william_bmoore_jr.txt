mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
other
members
of
this
court.
i
have
been
appointed
by
this
court
to
represent
this
petitioner
billy
don
franklin
boulden.
the
matter
before
the
court
that
we
raised
originally
was
on
an
involuntary
confession.
at
a
later
state
after
we've
gone
on
the
fifth
circuit,
the
witherspoon
case
came
out
and
i
raise
that
point
also
on
state
jury
and
i
talked
it
over
the
boulden
counsel,
both
of
which
have
comment
in
our
briefs
and
in
his
brief,
that
what
i
will
comment
on
both
these
aspects.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
we
did
not
--
i
did
not
raise
it
below
on
the
fifth
circuit,
no
sir.
because
it
didn't
come
out
until
after
i've
been
to
the
fifth
circuit.
that's
why,
your
honor,
i
just
want
to
spawn
out
things
at
story.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
i
believe
that
in
my
brief,
i
have
found
a
case
whereby
you
find
it
your
honor
you
can
consider
in
clifford
--
stuart
versus
sea
groups,
the
court
pointed
out
that
matters
if
were
not
passed
on
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
sir?
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
it's
from
this
court
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
sir?
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
this
is
a
federal
--
this
is
supreme
court
decision
that
i
was
referring
to
here.
it's
in
the
brief.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
it's
on
appeal
it
started
in
state
court
of
alabama.
yes,
they
came
through
the
district
court
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
we're
here.
i
would
like
to
comment
first
on
the
aspect
of
it
having
to
do
with
the
involuntary
confession.
this
is
a
--
as
i
understand
involuntary
confession,
the
totality
of
circumstances
doctrine
really
gets
down
to
the
question
of
common
sense.
whether
or
not
the
accused
gave
up
some
right
that
he
had
and
whether
or
not
he
was
coerced
and
whether
or
not
individual
can
be
coerced
under
these
circumstances.
in
brief
to
kept
suited
here,
we
have
19-year-old
negro
boy,
who
was
on
the
woods
fishing,
a
15-year-old
white
married
girl
comes
along
and
whether
he
seduced
or
not
is
open
to
speculation.
in
any
event,
they
entered
into
two
acts
and
as
they
were
coming
back
down
out
of
the
woods,
it
game
warden
who
was
unbeknown
either
one
up
in
the
woods
halted
them
and
charged
at
that
point,
this
young
boy
took
a
pistol
and
shot
the
game
warden.
he
apparently
lost
his
head
if
the
evidence
is
correct
because
and
he
took
the
officer's
pistol
and
emptied
it
and
then
he
was
charged
with
cutting
him
with
a
knife
some
55
feet
to
the
woods.
a
lot
of
unusual
circumstances
like,
it's
a
small
boy
and
a
200-pound
game
warden,
no
blood
on
the
boy
but
the
game
warden
really
bloody.
but
then
we
get
on
into
the
confession
part
of
it.
he
was
immediately
apprehended
at
the
scene.
very
shortly
thereafter,
the
girl
ran
out
on
the
woods
and
she
hide
and
a
two
police
officer
happen
to
hear,
and
came
in
and
apprehended
him.
the
state
troopers
came
in,
the
local
sheriff's
organization.
there
was
some
20
police
officers
at
there
immediately
and
at
that
time,
according
to
the
record,
the
police
captain,
or
the
state
trooper
captain
said,
he's
told
him
he
didn't
do
it.
the
girl
was
brought
forward
and
she
said
that's
him
then
according
to
the
boy,
he
and
the
captain
had
some
conversation
to
the
effect
in
one
occasion,
“if
you
don't
confess,
i'm
going
to
turn
loose
on
you.”
prior
to
them
getting
the
atmosphere
was
building
up
all
this
time
and
that
one
of
these
police
officers
had
has
it
gun
out,
said,
“how
old
are
you
boy?”
he
told
them,
he
said,
"you're
old
enough
to
die."
he
said,
"run,
i
haven't
killed
any
negro
all
day.”
with
this
sort
of
atmosphere
building
up
all
the
time.
their
meeting
that
took
three
cars
to
transport
him
not
back
to
his
home
but
across
the
river
onward
to
morgan
county.
then
the
police
officers
come
in,
the
two
of
them,
the
interrogator
and
the
captain,
and
one
of
them
has
a
hidden
microphone
and
a
tape
recorder
and
you
can
hear
those,
if
you
listen
to
the
tape,
you
could
hear
the
anonymous
sound
of
the
jail
doors
opened
and
closing
which
means
that
nothing
had
gone
on
until
they
turn
that
tape
on
and
at
that
time,
we
get
out.
this
is
the
first
question.
“then
and
now,
you
understand
what
we're
doing?
we
just
want
to
talk
to
you.
we
want
you
to
tell
us
the
truth
about
everything
that
happened
today.”
now,
that's
all
the
one
that
he
had.
he
wouldn't
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
it's
in
the
county
jail
in
an
adjoining
county.
he
was
taken
as
they
say
in
“for
safekeeping
not
to
his
home
jail.”
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
he
was
arrested
in
the
late
afternoon,
about
five
o'clock
and
this
is
around
midnight
around
eleven
o'clock.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
well,
as
two
or
three,
yes,
we're
going
to
get
to
those
in
just
a
minute.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
it
occured
in
athens,
alabama
sir.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
morgan.
that
happened
in
morgan
county.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes
sir
and
instead
of
--
i
misunderstood
what
you
may
ask.
instead
of
being
carried
to
tekita,
he
was
carried
enough
to
athens
and
had
troopers
in
the
front
and
the
back
even
riding
in
a
car
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
sir?
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
out
in
the
county
of
--
from
tekita
as
out
across
the
river
down
there.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes.
he
was
down
there
fishing
on
the
creek,
mind.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
fred
community
is
the
name
of
it.
it's
--
there's
a
very
small
community
down
there.
i
missed
one
thing
at
fred
community.
the
mob
started
together
before
they
were
taken
out
of
there.
there
was
a
lot
of
talk,
a
lot
of
people
congregate.
well,
they
took
him
on
in
the
station
and
in
the
sheriff's
office
and
put
him
on
a
cell
in
a
jail
up
in
athens,
alabama,
in
the
adjoining
county
from
where
he
was.
his
daddy
was
down
there
trying
to
find
him
in
morgan
and
they
told
him
he
couldn't
see
him,
couldn't
talk
to
him.
well,
after
they
got
this
tape
recorded
with
this
hidden
microphone
and
this
case
is
--
it
must
have
been
the
same
investigator
because
he
said
he
was
just
trying
to
familiarize
himself
with
the
person.
he
was
just
getting
acquainted.
and
after
he
got
acquainted
for
about
an
hours
worth,
then
he
came
back
in
there
and
reduced
this
confession
to
rape.
now,
he
still
hadn't
told
him
that
he
had
a
right
to
keep
quiet.
nobody
ever
told
him
that
he
might
have
a
right
to
a
lawyer.
but
they
told
him,
finally,
it
was
written
in
this
written
confession
that
it
might
used
against
him.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
this
was
sometime
after
midnight,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
this
is
at
may
1,
1960,
a
month
before
miranda.'60.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
realized
it.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
but
the
circumstances
could
be
considered
whether
or
not
he
did
have
not
only
a
right
to
a
lawyer
but
a
right
to
remain
silent.
i
mean,
that's
my
main
point,
the
right
to
remain
silent
was
never
told
to
him
the
same.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
19,
sir.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
little
fellow,
120
pounds,
then
sickly,
had
broken
legs,
bruises
in
his
legs,
had
a
series
of
headaches.
83
iq,
so
normal.
we
had
a
psychologist
that
said
that
his
defensive
mechanism
would
make
him
do
more
anything
to
avoid
immediate
danger
and
that
what
might
happen
to
him
in
the
next
week
but
that
was
his
basic
defensive
mechanism.
that's
in
the
record;
it's
also
in
the
brief.
alright,
then
this
--
i
got
a
hold
to
this
first
confession
and
had
it
transcribed
and
it's
in
the
record.
they
brought
the
tapes
in
and
i
think
the
tape
is
also
a
part
of
the
record
now.
and
this
was
just
conversation
in
rough
language,
the
use
of
four
letter
words
and
this
sort
of
thing
where
if
i
understood,
each
other
they
talked
in
the
jail
cell.
then
he
pause
it
up
a
little
bit
and
put
it
in
a
considerable
platform
and
billy
don
frank
boulden
signed.
the
next
morning
at
six
o'clock,
he
is
carried
back
to
morgan
county
and
judge
bloodworth
who
was
one
of
the
circuit
judges
there,
had
him
brought
in
at
one
room
in
the
courthouse,
right
with
state
troopers
in
the
courtroom
and
proceeded
to
tell
him
his
rights.
they
told
him
a
right
--
that
he
had
a
right
to
a
preliminary,
he
had
a
right
to
a
hearing,
on
bond
and
all
his
other
rights
and
a
right
to
have
an
attorney
if
he
couldn't
have
one.
and
it
proper
send
him
off
to
kill
(inaudible).
four
days
later,
i
believe
it
was
they
--
two
police
officers,
the
same
two
state
troopers
along
with
the
local
sheriff
and
the
deputy
fire
marshal,
rode
down
to
get
him
to
bring
him
back
to
morgan
county.
and
on
the
way
back,
they
stopped
by
the
scene
and
had
him
reenact
the
scene.
they
have
want
ahead
and
the
state
solicitor
was
out
there,
there
was
also
i
believe
the
electronic
equipment.
and
again
they
had
a
hidden
microphone
and
led
him
around
through
it
and
supplied,
suggested
answers
to
him
which
you
could
hear
on
the
tape
and
had
another
full
confession.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
sir
and
they
also
are
transcribed.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
in
my
chronicle,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
i've
already
passed
it.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
a
matter
of
fact,
i'm
down
to
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
i'm
down
to
the
third
where
they
took
him
back
to
the
scene,
i'll
be
happy
to
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
the
state
trooper.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
i
believe
you
see
the
signature
in
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
no
question.
i
mean
that's
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
not
at
issue.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
in
great
detail
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
i
can
answer
your
question
about
it,
i
believe
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
i
believe
i
can
answer
most
--
i
think
you
--
answer
about
it,
i'll
try.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
well,
i'll
try
to
comment
on
that
on
rebuttal.
i
want
to
save
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
all
right
sir,
i'm
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
i'm
trying
to
touch
all
the
basis
put
it
again
and
save
my
time
to.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
so,
that
we
get
him
out
down
the
woods
with
the
ringed
state
troopers
around.
this
is
third
confession.
the
hidden
microphones,
that
he
didn't
know
anything
about,
the
handcuffs
off
and
said,
“alright,
lead
us
to
it”
and
then
they
reenacted
the
scene
out
there.
again,
nobody
told
him
then
by
everybody's
admission
that
he
had
a
right
to
remain
silent.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
had
been
told
about
all
his
rights
but
the
judge
but
nobody
had
done
anything
about
it.
if
he
had
had
a
lawyer,
he
certainly
wouldn't
made
those
first
two
confessions.
here
is
out
of
the
scene
being
told
him
to
reenact
it
with
his
handcuffs
off
and
ringed
by
state
troopers.
and
they
had
told
about
all
his
rights
but
nobody
had
done
much
about
it.
but
he
already
confessed
twice
before
we
get
out
into
this.
well,
then
they
go
to
the
trial.
this
was
on
may
1st,
and
2nd,
and
four
days
later,
and
we
go
to
trial
on
may
the
21st.
i
was
not
in
the
trial,
there
was
a
lawyer
appointed
for
him
up
there.
the
lawyer
was
appointed
the
date
before
i
believe.
no,
no,
no,
several
days
before,
a
week
before.
then
he
was
arraigned
and
they
went
to
trial
on
may
27th.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
this
taped
in
the
woods
confession
where
he
reenacted
was
first
ready
and
it's
at
that
one
enough
then
they
played
the
tapes
for
the
jury
just
before
the
retired.
now,
this
lawyer
that
was
representing
the
petitioner
objected
to
the
reading.
he
objected
to
the
playing
of
the
tapes
and
that's
all
in
the
record.
it's
put
in
thoroughly
in
there.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
he
went
--
they
went
back,
had
a
hearing
before
the
judge
in
showed
it
to
him
and
the
judge
has
--
i'll
answer
that
in
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
let
me
comment
briefly
if
i
may
on
the
second
point
we've
raised
here.
and
this
is
the
witherspoon
case.
there
are
16
in
alabama,
one
of
the
--
we
have
a
code
section
which
allows
you
to
ask,
whether
or
not
you
should
believe
in
capital
punishment
or
have
a
fixed
opinion
against
capital
punishment
and
16
of
these
people
said,
they
did
and
they
have
set
out
in
detail.
here's
a
typical
one,
read
for
w.
mixon.
i
have
the
affixed
opinion
against
capital
punishment.
mr.
hunt
had
challenged
the
court
defense,
there
should
--
no
question,
the
court
stand
aside.
this
went
on
for
16
times
and
which
we
say
is
squarely
right
in
the
phase
of
this
witherspoon
opinion,
in
which
six
of
the
juror
said,
they
did
not
believe
in
the
death
penalty
with
excuse
without
any
attempt
to
determine
whether
they
could
nevertheless
return
it
further
took
down.
and
these
16
laws
with
two
possible
exceptions,
was
summarily
dismissed,
excused
forth
with
not
right
without
any
further
common
question.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
yes.
i
took
each
one
of
their
testimonies
that
is
to
go
for
four-five
miles
there.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
no,
what
i'm
telling,
those
are
firmly
within
witherspoon
as
i
see
it.
john
l.
nelson
raised
his
hand.
this
is
page
17.
mr.
hunt
had
challenged,
"do
you
have
a
fixed
opinion
against
captain
penitentiary
punishment."
mr.
nelson,
"capital
punishment."
do
you
think
you
would
never
be
willing
to
inflict
the
death
penalty
in
a
type
of
case?
yes.
we
challenged.
now
that
might
be
an
exception
but
over
here
the
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
do
you
have
a
fixed
plan
against
capital
punishment?
capital
punishment,
do
you
mean
you
would
never
inflict
the
death
penalty?
that's
right
challenge.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
for
those
that
two
in
our
list.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
now,
then
we
get
to
the
next
in
riley,
do
you
have
a
fixed
opinion
against
capital
punishment?
capital
punishment,
challenge,
no
question
stand
aside.
simpson,
do
you
have
a
fixed
opinion
against
capital
punishment?
yes,
i
challenge.
no
question,
stand
aside.
so
that
at
least
14
of
them
are
like
that
where
they
just
for
prelim
of
--
for
excuse
me.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
may
it
please
the
honorable
court.
at
rebuttal,
i
got
a
few
notes
down
here.
number
one,
my
good
friend,
mr.
david
clark
said,
this
bar
was
curious
to
seek.
when
you
get
to
read
in
the
record,
you'll
see
in
there
that
the
solicitor
commented
very
firmly
on
it
when
he
was
trying
to
send
the
man
back
for
safekeeping.
because
he
said,
you
know,
he
knows
what
happened
out
there
at
fled
last
night
with
that
boulden
together.
then
we
get
on
down
into
what
boulden
told
the
girl
at
the
scene.
the
record,
mr.
justice
will
reveal
that
boulden
told
the
girl
to
run.
she
was
not
an
eyewitness
to
the
murder
if
he
did
kill
him
which
he
is
denied.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
we
thought
it
particularly
appropriate
and
did
set
out
on
page
24
in
here
what
led
up
to
this
thing
her
testimony
and
she
did
testify.
as
to
acts
up
there
in
the
woods.
the
precautions
he
use,
the
use
of
contraceptives
on
both
times
and
this
is
spilled
out
by
her
own
testimony
in
some
detail
indicating
that
now,
this
right
thing
was
an
afterthought
when
she
got
in
and
saw
the
police
officer.
and
boulden
was
the
one
who
told
her
to
run.
to
me,
one
of
the
most
impressive
matters
in
this
whole
thing
here
is
that
these
officers
wanted
a
confession.
they
wanted
a
confession
to
convict.
they
weren't
looking
for
who
did.
they
thought
they
have
found
and
under
one
of
the
outstanding
opinion
of
this
court.
they
were
after
a
confession
on
which
they
could
convict
and
could
hang
this
man.
he
was
never
told
that
any
time,
that
you
don't
have
to
tell
it
to
us,
that
you
got
a
right
to
remain
quiet.
just
because
they
didn't
put
him
on
bread
and
water
and
put
a
lash
on
his
back
it
doesn't
mean
he
wasn't
coerced.
just
because
his
bathroom
privileges
weren't
taken
away
from
him,
they
gave
him
a
couple
of
cigarettes
that
doesn't
mean
he
wasn't
coerced.
when
those
two
police
officers
were
standing
there
with
this
man
in
his
cell
with
those
doors
clinging
behind
him,
telling
him
“we
want
to
know
what
happened.”
a
little
bit
of
a
120-pound
boy.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
19,
never
been
in
trouble
before.
had
a
frail
health
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
did
he
have
a
pistol?
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
think
he
did.
they
never
found
it
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
in
some
of
his
confessions,
he
did
and
they
never
show
it
up
in
the
trial.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
he
has
said
so,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
he
has
said
so
later
when
he
got
before
the
governor.
he
said,
at
that
time,
two
other
men
showed
up
in
the
scene
and
did
it.
and
he
said
it
threatened
his
family
and
he
was
trying
to
protect
his
family.
again,
i
cannot
vouch
one
way
or
the
other.
the
circumstances,
i
see
it
throughout
it
strange.
i
wouldn't
have
got
the
bloody
clothe
when
they
brought
it
down.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
very
short.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
very
shortly.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
less
than
about
a
half
mile
to
a
mile.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
very
shortly,
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
this
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
that's
right.
and
he
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
he
was
back
down
in
the
woods.
his
story
has
been
changed
that
two
men
came
up
and
were
fishermen
indeed
but
again
i'm
not
trying
my
lawsuit
on
this.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
this
is
what
he
told
when
he
got
in
the
governor's
office,
what
he
told
when
we
started
in
the
district
court,
this
is
when
i
got
in
the
case
in
the
district
court.
judge
johnston
was
first
association
that
i
haven't
had
the
kid.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
apparently,
they
just
apprehended
him
as
the
way
i
read
this
record
and
in
call
for
the
highway
patrol.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
the
record
then
revealed
that
your
honor.
my
--
my
recollection
is
to
whether
he
was
actually
running
at
that
time
or
not.
i
think
he
was
just
out
there
in
the
woods
is
about
all
we
know.
but
he
--
though
not,
never
was
he
told
that
he
had
a
right
to
remain
silent
and
i
think
you
got
to
know
what
a
right
is.
know
that
you
got
one
before
you
can
give
it
up.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
they
did.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
substantially,
what
his
confession
say?
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
not
at
that
time.
no,
sir.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
no
sir,
he
did
not.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
at
the
trial.
they
did.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
again,
he
said
that
he
was
protecting
his
family.
that
was
what
he
said
in
the
later
time.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
this
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
he
testified
to
that
at
the
--
in
the
district
court
hearing
and
the
original
hearing
--
i
don't
think
it
was
ever
asked
there,
no
sir.
not
at
the
original
trial.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
he
was
asked
if
he
shoot
him.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
no,
sir.
he
was
asked
a
series
of
questions
just
about
running
along
in
the
form
of
this
confession
that
was
taken
out
and
the
same
way
reenacted.
and
when
he
took
his
handcuffs
and
when
you
read
it,
you
would
see
he
said,
“well,
i'm
even
glad
to
get
my
handcuffs
back
on”
because
he
was
ringed
with
security
and
people
out
there
then.
again,
nobody
had
ever
told
him
he
didn't
have
right
to
keep
his
mouth
shut.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
i
don't
know
if
anybody
has
ever
asked
him
that
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
that's
the
reason
he
test
--
what
he
now
says
as
the
reason
he
testified
and
made
his
confession.
no,
no,
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
didn't
mean
that
at
all.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
if
he
did
it
to
circumstances
then
he
can
lost
his
head
which
certainly
didn't
spelled
out
first
degree
murder
but
again,
that's
not
what
the
reason
here.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
judge
again,
we
were
trying
to
cut
this
record
down
pursuant
to
our
instruction
and
i
don't
--
let's
see
how
much
here
were
picked
up.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
we
will
have
to
go
back
to
the
original
record
which
is
here.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
now
again,
i
want
to
make
one
more
observation.
i
realized
that
the
routes
that
i
have
presented
to
this
court
or
in
congress.
if
i'm
correct
that
this
is
an
involuntary
confession
by
statute,
then
i
presume
he's
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
if
on
the
other
hand,
witherspoon
is
applicable,
i
presume
then
his
conviction
would
stand
but
the
death
penalty
could
not
be
carried
out.
and
this
is
obviously
the
decision
the
court
will
make
in
any
event
one
way
or
the
other.
but
i
thought
i
owe
the
court
an
explanation
why
so
both
routes.
as
the
attorney
for
the
man,
it
appears
to
me
that
i
must
exhaust
all
possible
remedies
and
laws
of
protection
that
he
might
have.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
alright,
so
i'm
halucinating.
there
were
some
question
as
to
where
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
well,
i
understand
that.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
if
i
could
answer
any
question,
i'd
be
pleased
to
try.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
other
members
of
this
court.
i
have
been
appointed
by
this
court
to
represent
this
petitioner
billy
don
franklin
boulden.
the
matter
before
the
court
that
we
raised
originally
was
on
an
involuntary
confession.
at
a
later
state
after
we've
gone
on
the
fifth
circuit,
the
witherspoon
case
came
out
and
i
raise
that
point
also
on
state
jury
and
i
talked
it
over
the
boulden
counsel,
both
of
which
have
comment
in
our
briefs
and
in
his
brief,
that
what
i
will
comment
on
both
these
aspects.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
we
did
not
--
i
did
not
raise
it
below
on
the
fifth
circuit,
no
sir.
because
it
didn't
come
out
until
after
i've
been
to
the
fifth
circuit.
that's
why,
your
honor,
i
just
want
to
spawn
out
things
at
story.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
i
believe
that
in
my
brief,
i
have
found
a
case
whereby
you
find
it
your
honor
you
can
consider
in
clifford
--
stuart
versus
sea
groups,
the
court
pointed
out
that
matters
if
were
not
passed
on
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
sir?
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
it's
from
this
court
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
sir?
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
this
is
a
federal
--
this
is
supreme
court
decision
that
i
was
referring
to
here.
it's
in
the
brief.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
it's
on
appeal
it
started
in
state
court
of
alabama.
yes,
they
came
through
the
district
court
and
then
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
we're
here.
i
would
like
to
comment
first
on
the
aspect
of
it
having
to
do
with
the
involuntary
confession.
this
is
a
--
as
i
understand
involuntary
confession,
the
totality
of
circumstances
doctrine
really
gets
down
to
the
question
of
common
sense.
whether
or
not
the
accused
gave
up
some
right
that
he
had
and
whether
or
not
he
was
coerced
and
whether
or
not
individual
can
be
coerced
under
these
circumstances.
in
brief
to
kept
suited
here,
we
have
19-year-old
negro
boy,
who
was
on
the
woods
fishing,
a
15-year-old
white
married
girl
comes
along
and
whether
he
seduced
or
not
is
open
to
speculation.
in
any
event,
they
entered
into
two
acts
and
as
they
were
coming
back
down
out
of
the
woods,
it
game
warden
who
was
unbeknown
either
one
up
in
the
woods
halted
them
and
charged
at
that
point,
this
young
boy
took
a
pistol
and
shot
the
game
warden.
he
apparently
lost
his
head
if
the
evidence
is
correct
because
and
he
took
the
officer's
pistol
and
emptied
it
and
then
he
was
charged
with
cutting
him
with
a
knife
some
55
feet
to
the
woods.
a
lot
of
unusual
circumstances
like,
it's
a
small
boy
and
a
200-pound
game
warden,
no
blood
on
the
boy
but
the
game
warden
really
bloody.
but
then
we
get
on
into
the
confession
part
of
it.
he
was
immediately
apprehended
at
the
scene.
very
shortly
thereafter,
the
girl
ran
out
on
the
woods
and
she
hide
and
a
two
police
officer
happen
to
hear,
and
came
in
and
apprehended
him.
the
state
troopers
came
in,
the
local
sheriff's
organization.
there
was
some
20
police
officers
at
there
immediately
and
at
that
time,
according
to
the
record,
the
police
captain,
or
the
state
trooper
captain
said,
he's
told
him
he
didn't
do
it.
the
girl
was
brought
forward
and
she
said
that's
him
then
according
to
the
boy,
he
and
the
captain
had
some
conversation
to
the
effect
in
one
occasion,
“if
you
don't
confess,
i'm
going
to
turn
loose
on
you.”
prior
to
them
getting
the
atmosphere
was
building
up
all
this
time
and
that
one
of
these
police
officers
had
has
it
gun
out,
said,
“how
old
are
you
boy?”
he
told
them,
he
said,
"you're
old
enough
to
die."
he
said,
"run,
i
haven't
killed
any
negro
all
day.”
with
this
sort
of
atmosphere
building
up
all
the
time.
their
meeting
that
took
three
cars
to
transport
him
not
back
to
his
home
but
across
the
river
onward
to
morgan
county.
then
the
police
officers
come
in,
the
two
of
them,
the
interrogator
and
the
captain,
and
one
of
them
has
a
hidden
microphone
and
a
tape
recorder
and
you
can
hear
those,
if
you
listen
to
the
tape,
you
could
hear
the
anonymous
sound
of
the
jail
doors
opened
and
closing
which
means
that
nothing
had
gone
on
until
they
turn
that
tape
on
and
at
that
time,
we
get
out.
this
is
the
first
question.
“then
and
now,
you
understand
what
we're
doing?
we
just
want
to
talk
to
you.
we
want
you
to
tell
us
the
truth
about
everything
that
happened
today.”
now,
that's
all
the
one
that
he
had.
he
wouldn't
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
it's
in
the
county
jail
in
an
adjoining
county.
he
was
taken
as
they
say
in
“for
safekeeping
not
to
his
home
jail.”
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
he
was
arrested
in
the
late
afternoon,
about
five
o'clock
and
this
is
around
midnight
around
eleven
o'clock.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
well,
as
two
or
three,
yes,
we're
going
to
get
to
those
in
just
a
minute.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
it
occured
in
athens,
alabama
sir.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
morgan.
that
happened
in
morgan
county.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes
sir
and
instead
of
--
i
misunderstood
what
you
may
ask.
instead
of
being
carried
to
tekita,
he
was
carried
enough
to
athens
and
had
troopers
in
the
front
and
the
back
even
riding
in
a
car
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
sir?
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
out
in
the
county
of
--
from
tekita
as
out
across
the
river
down
there.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes.
he
was
down
there
fishing
on
the
creek,
mind.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
fred
community
is
the
name
of
it.
it's
--
there's
a
very
small
community
down
there.
i
missed
one
thing
at
fred
community.
the
mob
started
together
before
they
were
taken
out
of
there.
there
was
a
lot
of
talk,
a
lot
of
people
congregate.
well,
they
took
him
on
in
the
station
and
in
the
sheriff's
office
and
put
him
on
a
cell
in
a
jail
up
in
athens,
alabama,
in
the
adjoining
county
from
where
he
was.
his
daddy
was
down
there
trying
to
find
him
in
morgan
and
they
told
him
he
couldn't
see
him,
couldn't
talk
to
him.
well,
after
they
got
this
tape
recorded
with
this
hidden
microphone
and
this
case
is
--
it
must
have
been
the
same
investigator
because
he
said
he
was
just
trying
to
familiarize
himself
with
the
person.
he
was
just
getting
acquainted.
and
after
he
got
acquainted
for
about
an
hours
worth,
then
he
came
back
in
there
and
reduced
this
confession
to
rape.
now,
he
still
hadn't
told
him
that
he
had
a
right
to
keep
quiet.
nobody
ever
told
him
that
he
might
have
a
right
to
a
lawyer.
but
they
told
him,
finally,
it
was
written
in
this
written
confession
that
it
might
used
against
him.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
this
was
sometime
after
midnight,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
this
is
at
may
1,
1960,
a
month
before
miranda.'60.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
realized
it.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
but
the
circumstances
could
be
considered
whether
or
not
he
did
have
not
only
a
right
to
a
lawyer
but
a
right
to
remain
silent.
i
mean,
that's
my
main
point,
the
right
to
remain
silent
was
never
told
to
him
the
same.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
19,
sir.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
little
fellow,
120
pounds,
then
sickly,
had
broken
legs,
bruises
in
his
legs,
had
a
series
of
headaches.
83
iq,
so
normal.
we
had
a
psychologist
that
said
that
his
defensive
mechanism
would
make
him
do
more
anything
to
avoid
immediate
danger
and
that
what
might
happen
to
him
in
the
next
week
but
that
was
his
basic
defensive
mechanism.
that's
in
the
record;
it's
also
in
the
brief.
alright,
then
this
--
i
got
a
hold
to
this
first
confession
and
had
it
transcribed
and
it's
in
the
record.
they
brought
the
tapes
in
and
i
think
the
tape
is
also
a
part
of
the
record
now.
and
this
was
just
conversation
in
rough
language,
the
use
of
four
letter
words
and
this
sort
of
thing
where
if
i
understood,
each
other
they
talked
in
the
jail
cell.
then
he
pause
it
up
a
little
bit
and
put
it
in
a
considerable
platform
and
billy
don
frank
boulden
signed.
the
next
morning
at
six
o'clock,
he
is
carried
back
to
morgan
county
and
judge
bloodworth
who
was
one
of
the
circuit
judges
there,
had
him
brought
in
at
one
room
in
the
courthouse,
right
with
state
troopers
in
the
courtroom
and
proceeded
to
tell
him
his
rights.
they
told
him
a
right
--
that
he
had
a
right
to
a
preliminary,
he
had
a
right
to
a
hearing,
on
bond
and
all
his
other
rights
and
a
right
to
have
an
attorney
if
he
couldn't
have
one.
and
it
proper
send
him
off
to
kill
(inaudible).
four
days
later,
i
believe
it
was
they
--
two
police
officers,
the
same
two
state
troopers
along
with
the
local
sheriff
and
the
deputy
fire
marshal,
rode
down
to
get
him
to
bring
him
back
to
morgan
county.
and
on
the
way
back,
they
stopped
by
the
scene
and
had
him
reenact
the
scene.
they
have
want
ahead
and
the
state
solicitor
was
out
there,
there
was
also
i
believe
the
electronic
equipment.
and
again
they
had
a
hidden
microphone
and
led
him
around
through
it
and
supplied,
suggested
answers
to
him
which
you
could
hear
on
the
tape
and
had
another
full
confession.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
sir
and
they
also
are
transcribed.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
in
my
chronicle,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
i've
already
passed
it.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
a
matter
of
fact,
i'm
down
to
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
i'm
down
to
the
third
where
they
took
him
back
to
the
scene,
i'll
be
happy
to
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
the
state
trooper.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
i
believe
you
see
the
signature
in
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
no
question.
i
mean
that's
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
not
at
issue.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
in
great
detail
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
i
can
answer
your
question
about
it,
i
believe
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
i
believe
i
can
answer
most
--
i
think
you
--
answer
about
it,
i'll
try.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
well,
i'll
try
to
comment
on
that
on
rebuttal.
i
want
to
save
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
all
right
sir,
i'm
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
i'm
trying
to
touch
all
the
basis
put
it
again
and
save
my
time
to.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
so,
that
we
get
him
out
down
the
woods
with
the
ringed
state
troopers
around.
this
is
third
confession.
the
hidden
microphones,
that
he
didn't
know
anything
about,
the
handcuffs
off
and
said,
“alright,
lead
us
to
it”
and
then
they
reenacted
the
scene
out
there.
again,
nobody
told
him
then
by
everybody's
admission
that
he
had
a
right
to
remain
silent.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
had
been
told
about
all
his
rights
but
the
judge
but
nobody
had
done
anything
about
it.
if
he
had
had
a
lawyer,
he
certainly
wouldn't
made
those
first
two
confessions.
here
is
out
of
the
scene
being
told
him
to
reenact
it
with
his
handcuffs
off
and
ringed
by
state
troopers.
and
they
had
told
about
all
his
rights
but
nobody
had
done
much
about
it.
but
he
already
confessed
twice
before
we
get
out
into
this.
well,
then
they
go
to
the
trial.
this
was
on
may
1st,
and
2nd,
and
four
days
later,
and
we
go
to
trial
on
may
the
21st.
i
was
not
in
the
trial,
there
was
a
lawyer
appointed
for
him
up
there.
the
lawyer
was
appointed
the
date
before
i
believe.
no,
no,
no,
several
days
before,
a
week
before.
then
he
was
arraigned
and
they
went
to
trial
on
may
27th.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
this
taped
in
the
woods
confession
where
he
reenacted
was
first
ready
and
it's
at
that
one
enough
then
they
played
the
tapes
for
the
jury
just
before
the
retired.
now,
this
lawyer
that
was
representing
the
petitioner
objected
to
the
reading.
he
objected
to
the
playing
of
the
tapes
and
that's
all
in
the
record.
it's
put
in
thoroughly
in
there.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
he
went
--
they
went
back,
had
a
hearing
before
the
judge
in
showed
it
to
him
and
the
judge
has
--
i'll
answer
that
in
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
let
me
comment
briefly
if
i
may
on
the
second
point
we've
raised
here.
and
this
is
the
witherspoon
case.
there
are
16
in
alabama,
one
of
the
--
we
have
a
code
section
which
allows
you
to
ask,
whether
or
not
you
should
believe
in
capital
punishment
or
have
a
fixed
opinion
against
capital
punishment
and
16
of
these
people
said,
they
did
and
they
have
set
out
in
detail.
here's
a
typical
one,
read
for
w.
mixon.
i
have
the
affixed
opinion
against
capital
punishment.
mr.
hunt
had
challenged
the
court
defense,
there
should
--
no
question,
the
court
stand
aside.
this
went
on
for
16
times
and
which
we
say
is
squarely
right
in
the
phase
of
this
witherspoon
opinion,
in
which
six
of
the
juror
said,
they
did
not
believe
in
the
death
penalty
with
excuse
without
any
attempt
to
determine
whether
they
could
nevertheless
return
it
further
took
down.
and
these
16
laws
with
two
possible
exceptions,
was
summarily
dismissed,
excused
forth
with
not
right
without
any
further
common
question.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
yes.
i
took
each
one
of
their
testimonies
that
is
to
go
for
four-five
miles
there.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
no,
what
i'm
telling,
those
are
firmly
within
witherspoon
as
i
see
it.
john
l.
nelson
raised
his
hand.
this
is
page
17.
mr.
hunt
had
challenged,
"do
you
have
a
fixed
opinion
against
captain
penitentiary
punishment."
mr.
nelson,
"capital
punishment."
do
you
think
you
would
never
be
willing
to
inflict
the
death
penalty
in
a
type
of
case?
yes.
we
challenged.
now
that
might
be
an
exception
but
over
here
the
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
do
you
have
a
fixed
plan
against
capital
punishment?
capital
punishment,
do
you
mean
you
would
never
inflict
the
death
penalty?
that's
right
challenge.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
for
those
that
two
in
our
list.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
now,
then
we
get
to
the
next
in
riley,
do
you
have
a
fixed
opinion
against
capital
punishment?
capital
punishment,
challenge,
no
question
stand
aside.
simpson,
do
you
have
a
fixed
opinion
against
capital
punishment?
yes,
i
challenge.
no
question,
stand
aside.
so
that
at
least
14
of
them
are
like
that
where
they
just
for
prelim
of
--
for
excuse
me.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
may
it
please
the
honorable
court.
at
rebuttal,
i
got
a
few
notes
down
here.
number
one,
my
good
friend,
mr.
david
clark
said,
this
bar
was
curious
to
seek.
when
you
get
to
read
in
the
record,
you'll
see
in
there
that
the
solicitor
commented
very
firmly
on
it
when
he
was
trying
to
send
the
man
back
for
safekeeping.
because
he
said,
you
know,
he
knows
what
happened
out
there
at
fled
last
night
with
that
boulden
together.
then
we
get
on
down
into
what
boulden
told
the
girl
at
the
scene.
the
record,
mr.
justice
will
reveal
that
boulden
told
the
girl
to
run.
she
was
not
an
eyewitness
to
the
murder
if
he
did
kill
him
which
he
is
denied.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
that's
correct
sir.
we
thought
it
particularly
appropriate
and
did
set
out
on
page
24
in
here
what
led
up
to
this
thing
her
testimony
and
she
did
testify.
as
to
acts
up
there
in
the
woods.
the
precautions
he
use,
the
use
of
contraceptives
on
both
times
and
this
is
spilled
out
by
her
own
testimony
in
some
detail
indicating
that
now,
this
right
thing
was
an
afterthought
when
she
got
in
and
saw
the
police
officer.
and
boulden
was
the
one
who
told
her
to
run.
to
me,
one
of
the
most
impressive
matters
in
this
whole
thing
here
is
that
these
officers
wanted
a
confession.
they
wanted
a
confession
to
convict.
they
weren't
looking
for
who
did.
they
thought
they
have
found
and
under
one
of
the
outstanding
opinion
of
this
court.
they
were
after
a
confession
on
which
they
could
convict
and
could
hang
this
man.
he
was
never
told
that
any
time,
that
you
don't
have
to
tell
it
to
us,
that
you
got
a
right
to
remain
quiet.
just
because
they
didn't
put
him
on
bread
and
water
and
put
a
lash
on
his
back
it
doesn't
mean
he
wasn't
coerced.
just
because
his
bathroom
privileges
weren't
taken
away
from
him,
they
gave
him
a
couple
of
cigarettes
that
doesn't
mean
he
wasn't
coerced.
when
those
two
police
officers
were
standing
there
with
this
man
in
his
cell
with
those
doors
clinging
behind
him,
telling
him
“we
want
to
know
what
happened.”
a
little
bit
of
a
120-pound
boy.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
19,
never
been
in
trouble
before.
had
a
frail
health
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
did
he
have
a
pistol?
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
think
he
did.
they
never
found
it
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
in
some
of
his
confessions,
he
did
and
they
never
show
it
up
in
the
trial.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
he
has
said
so,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
he
has
said
so
later
when
he
got
before
the
governor.
he
said,
at
that
time,
two
other
men
showed
up
in
the
scene
and
did
it.
and
he
said
it
threatened
his
family
and
he
was
trying
to
protect
his
family.
again,
i
cannot
vouch
one
way
or
the
other.
the
circumstances,
i
see
it
throughout
it
strange.
i
wouldn't
have
got
the
bloody
clothe
when
they
brought
it
down.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
very
short.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
very
shortly.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
less
than
about
a
half
mile
to
a
mile.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
very
shortly,
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
this
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
that's
right.
and
he
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
he
was
back
down
in
the
woods.
his
story
has
been
changed
that
two
men
came
up
and
were
fishermen
indeed
but
again
i'm
not
trying
my
lawsuit
on
this.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
this
is
what
he
told
when
he
got
in
the
governor's
office,
what
he
told
when
we
started
in
the
district
court,
this
is
when
i
got
in
the
case
in
the
district
court.
judge
johnston
was
first
association
that
i
haven't
had
the
kid.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
apparently,
they
just
apprehended
him
as
the
way
i
read
this
record
and
in
call
for
the
highway
patrol.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
the
record
then
revealed
that
your
honor.
my
--
my
recollection
is
to
whether
he
was
actually
running
at
that
time
or
not.
i
think
he
was
just
out
there
in
the
woods
is
about
all
we
know.
but
he
--
though
not,
never
was
he
told
that
he
had
a
right
to
remain
silent
and
i
think
you
got
to
know
what
a
right
is.
know
that
you
got
one
before
you
can
give
it
up.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
they
did.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
substantially,
what
his
confession
say?
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
not
at
that
time.
no,
sir.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
no
sir,
he
did
not.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
at
the
trial.
they
did.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes,
sir.
again,
he
said
that
he
was
protecting
his
family.
that
was
what
he
said
in
the
later
time.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
this
is
correct.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
he
testified
to
that
at
the
--
in
the
district
court
hearing
and
the
original
hearing
--
i
don't
think
it
was
ever
asked
there,
no
sir.
not
at
the
original
trial.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
he
was
asked
if
he
shoot
him.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
no,
sir.
he
was
asked
a
series
of
questions
just
about
running
along
in
the
form
of
this
confession
that
was
taken
out
and
the
same
way
reenacted.
and
when
he
took
his
handcuffs
and
when
you
read
it,
you
would
see
he
said,
“well,
i'm
even
glad
to
get
my
handcuffs
back
on”
because
he
was
ringed
with
security
and
people
out
there
then.
again,
nobody
had
ever
told
him
he
didn't
have
right
to
keep
his
mouth
shut.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
i
don't
know
if
anybody
has
ever
asked
him
that
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
that's
the
reason
he
test
--
what
he
now
says
as
the
reason
he
testified
and
made
his
confession.
no,
no,
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
didn't
mean
that
at
all.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
if
he
did
it
to
circumstances
then
he
can
lost
his
head
which
certainly
didn't
spelled
out
first
degree
murder
but
again,
that's
not
what
the
reason
here.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
judge
again,
we
were
trying
to
cut
this
record
down
pursuant
to
our
instruction
and
i
don't
--
let's
see
how
much
here
were
picked
up.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
well,
i
think
--
we
will
have
to
go
back
to
the
original
record
which
is
here.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
now
again,
i
want
to
make
one
more
observation.
i
realized
that
the
routes
that
i
have
presented
to
this
court
or
in
congress.
if
i'm
correct
that
this
is
an
involuntary
confession
by
statute,
then
i
presume
he's
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
if
on
the
other
hand,
witherspoon
is
applicable,
i
presume
then
his
conviction
would
stand
but
the
death
penalty
could
not
be
carried
out.
and
this
is
obviously
the
decision
the
court
will
make
in
any
event
one
way
or
the
other.
but
i
thought
i
owe
the
court
an
explanation
why
so
both
routes.
as
the
attorney
for
the
man,
it
appears
to
me
that
i
must
exhaust
all
possible
remedies
and
laws
of
protection
that
he
might
have.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
alright,
so
i'm
halucinating.
there
were
some
question
as
to
where
--
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
well,
i
understand
that.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
if
i
could
answer
any
question,
i'd
be
pleased
to
try.
mr.
william
b.moore,
jr.
thank
you.
