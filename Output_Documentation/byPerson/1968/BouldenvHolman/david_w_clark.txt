mr.
david
w.
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
conviction
arising
in
morgan
county,
alabama.
the
crime
was
committed
on
may,
1st,
1964
in
the
afternoon.
now,
right
after
this
murder
occurred,
the
police
arrested
this
young
man
and
there
was
some
evidence
brought
after
there
was
a
mob
but
actually
the
patrolman
testified
a
few
curious
to
seek
this
came
around.
they
held
this
young
man
until
captain
john
williams
to
talk
with
him.
now,
the
petitioner
testified
that
someone
of
the
officers
threatened
to
kill
him,
told
him
to
run
and
they'll
shoot
him.
now,
we
had
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
was
denied.
mr.
david
w.
clark
it's
the
point
that
i'm
going
to
bring
out.
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
in
the
district
court
in
montgomery,
we
had
an
officer
john
brom,
who
testified
and
that's
on
the
record
page
657
that,
no
one
pointed
a
gun
at
the
petitioner
and
no
one
spoke
to
him
at
the
crowd,
that's
on
the
record
page
64.
now,
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
sir,
because
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
billy
boulden
said
that
there
was
an
officer
good
in
another
--
another
patrolman
there.
well,
this
was
on
the
other
patrolman
there
and
he
testified
he
didn't
point
it,
didn't
see
nobody
pointed
a
gun,
didn't
hear
anybody
threat
him.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
and
of
course,
judge
johnson,
the
district
judge
had
to
identify
that
both
of
their
testimonies.
his
conclusion
was
after
him
been
denied
habeas
corpus.
now,
as
we
pointed
out,
this
--
the
boy
was
arrested
about
5:30,
i
believe
around
7
or
7:30
that
night
pursuant
to
an
order
of
the
circuit
judge,
this
young
man
was
moved
to
the
joining
county's
jail,
limestone
county
in
athens,
alabama.
here,
he
was
interrogated.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
it
was
a
precautionary
measure.
there
had
been
a
murder
of
a
popular
man
and
there
had
been
a
positive
of
rape
there
and
to
keep
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
security
matters.
it
was
a
short
distance
to
the
next
county.
mr.
david
w.
clark
now,
there
was
this
something
said
about
he
wasn't
warned
of
his
rights
at
that
time
before
this
first
confession
was
taken.
that
was
the
one
made
the
first
at
the
jail
in
athens,
alabama
that
night.
now,
i'm
calling
the
court's
attention
to,
i
believe
its
appendix
page
45,
where
the
question
captain
williams
i
believe
you
stated
earlier.
"you
advised
the
defendant,
he
didn't
have
to
make
a
statement
and
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
lawyer."
"is
that
correct?"
answer,
"i
did."
"on
may
1?"
"yes,
sir."
that's
the
record
page
45,
rather
appendix
page.
mr.
david
w.
clark
incidentally,
this
trial,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
murder
occurred
on
the
first
of
may.
mr.
david
w.
clark
and
the
trial
was
may
the
27th
through
the
29th.
mr.
david
w.
clark
of
'64
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
prior
to
escobedo
or
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
should
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
it
was
not
an
absolute
requirement
throughout
alabama
but
in
that
circuit,
judge
bloodworth
was
really
an
advanced
judge
in
thinking
at
that
time.
he
had
insisted
on
those
things.
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
it
wasn't
at
that
time
judge.
mr.
david
w.
clark
it
was
not
an
absolute
requirement
at
that
time.
now,
i
should
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
an
attorney
was
appointed
at
arraignment
on
may
the
7th
and
this
should
note
incidentally
filed
the
matters
to
the
indictment
and
the
case
was
heard
about
three
weeks
later
he
had
time
to
prepare
for
it.
now,
back
to
the
confession
on
the
eve
of
may
the
1st;
after
being
advised
of
these
rights
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
what
time?
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
believe
it
was
around
10:30
-
11
o'clock
somewhere
in
that.
mr.
david
w.
clark
at
night,
sir.
he
had
been
faired
and
was
permitted
to
the
bathroom
facilities
and
so
forth
and
allowed
to
smoke
in
those
things.
there
was
no
long
interrogation.
mr.
david
w.
clark
it
is
my
understanding,
mr.
watts
asking
those
questions
and
then
wrote
it
down.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
sir.
that's
--
that
was
written
in
the
confession
but
at
the
time
watts
testified
at
habeas
corpus,
he
said
that
he
asked
the
man
these
questions
and
wrote
it
down
ask
when
it
to.
now,
after
this
confession
was
given
which
incidentally
i
would
like
to
point
out,
neither
this
confession
nor
the
tape
recording
was
used
at
the
original
trial
on
may
27th.
on
the
next
morning,
may
the
2nd,
petitioner
was
taken
before
judge
james
bloodworth
and
advised
of
his
rights.
he
was
advised
of
fully.
i
believe
there
is
127
pages
in
the
record
showing
the
advice
he
gave.
he
had
a
hearing
that
morning
six
o'clock,
he
advised
him
seriousness
of
each
of
the
offenses,
he
advised
him
to
get
a
lawyer,
how
serious
the
crimes
were
possibility
of
a
death
sentence
and
he
talked
with
the
parents
and
relatives
of
the
boy
also
and
told
them
that
that
is
incorrect.
now,
after
this
hearing
and
i
believe
at
that
time,
the
family
was
endeavoring
to
get
sherman
powell,
a
local
attorney
to
represent
don
boulden.
they
were
not
successful.
now,
because
of
further
precautionary
measures,
judge
bloodworth
had
this
man
transferred
to
kilby
prison.
now,
then
may
6th,
the
man
was
brought
back
to
guilty.
he
had
been
indicted
for
on
three
indictments
murder,
rape,
and
robbery.
he
was
tried
on
murder.
they
brought
him
back
and
passed
through
common
and
then
it
passed
through
the
cave
where
he
reenacted
the
crime.
now,
a
transcript
of
that
tape
and
those
tapes
were
put
in
evidence
at
the
trial.
now,
as
this
case
occurred
before
either
escobedo
or
miranda,
the
totality
of
circumstances
the
rule
was
applied.
now,
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner,
he
cites
payne
versus
arkansas.
well,
i
think
that
is
one
that
really
shows
all
the
faults
here
was
a
case
of
a
19-year
old
person,
a
boy
who
was
denied
of
hearing,
was
arrested
first
without
a
warrant,
denied
a
hearing
before
a
magistrate,
who
could
advice
him
of
his
right
to
remain
silent
or
to
counsel.
he
was
not
advised
of
his
rights
by
the
court
in
arkansas.
he
was
held
incommunicado
for
three
days
without
advice
of
counsel,
friends,
relatives.
he
was
denied
food
for
long
periods,
threatened
with
mob
violence
and
so
forth.
now,
those
things
in
the
totality
of
both
circumstances
would
indicate
an
involuntary
confession
with
one
who
was
coerced.
such
was
not
the
case
as
boulden
found.
mr.
david
w.
clark
she
explained
that
she
had
been
raped.
mr.
david
w.
clark
she
had
him
raped,
as
they
say
and
that
she
complained
of
rape.
mr.
david
w.
clark
to
this
officer.
mr.
david
w.
clark
and
at
that
time,
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
she
ran
to
the
officer,
yes
and
got
behind
the
officer
hays.
mr.
david
w.
clark
behind
to
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
she
got
--
she
ran
and
got
behind
officer
hays,
who
the
conservation
officer.
mr.
david
w.
clark
oh,
no
sir.
after
hays
was
killed,
she
ran
to
the
highway
and
contacted
some
highway
patrolman.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir,
she
was.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
believe
she
did.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i'm
not
certain,
your
honor,
without
looking
at
the
big
record
which
i
don't
have
it
before.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
don't
have
the
principal
--
she
ran
away
i
believe
before
he
had
actually
died,
the
conservation
officer.
she
ran
for
help.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
that
would
be
in
the
large
record
about
400
pages
it
was
sent
up
an
exhibit
a.
mr.
david
w.
clark
not
in
the
appendix,
no
sir.
and
i
believe
the
court
has
informed
us
that
your
honors
will
take
knowledge
of
that.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
sir.
of
course,
54
and
55
is
boulden's
statements.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
the
testimony
of
boulden.
now,
this
case
is
gone
to
the
district
court
on
federal
habeas
corpus
after
being
affirmed
by
supreme
court
of
alabama
in
anyone
up
to
the
fifth
circuit.
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
affirming
the
action
of
the
district
court
held
that
each
of
the
appellant's
statements,
his
actions,
the
facts
respecting
his
physical
and
mental
condition
and
environment
from
the
moment
of
his
arrest
to
the
end
of
the
last
interrogation
are
essential
fragments
are
passage
about
consideration
on
issue
of
voluntariness.
but
we
find
from
the
record
here,
no
possible
suggestion
that
boulden's
will
was
overborne
on
occasion
of
the
last
confession
by
having
made
earlier
ones.
now,
both
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
first
confession,
the
one
that
was
not
used
in
the
trial,
the
one
who
made
the
first
was
voluntary
and
also
that
the
second
one
was
also.
that
--
based
on
that,
they
held
that
under
the
totality
of
circumstances
rule
that
the
confession
was
voluntary.
now,
as
to
this
question
of
witherspoon,
as
mr.
moore
pointed
out,
witherspoon
took
place
after
we
had
filed
briefs
on
that.
however,
i
feel
that
the
objection
that
the
state
court
hasn't
had
a
chance
to
rule
on
it
would
be
a
waste
of
time,
if
we
went
back,
we
have
to
come
back
up
here
again
probably,
so
i
won't
press
that
objection.
i
would
like
to
point
out
on
the
witherspoon
case
that
the
illinois
statute
was
“in
trials
for
murder,
it
shall
be
caused
for
challenge
of
any
juror
who
shall
on
being
examined
state
that
he
has
conscientious
scrupulous
against
capital
punishment
or
that
he
is
opposed
to
this
thing.
now,
that
was
the
illinois
statute.
would
like
to
point
out
the
difference
of
our
side
of
section
36
and
57
in
alabama.
in
addition
to
about
12
grounds
that
were
challenged,
we
have
these
others
set
out
in
section
57.
on
the
trial,
for
any
offense
which
may
be
punished
capitally
or
by
imprisonment
and
penitentiary,
it
is
a
good
cause
of
challenge
by
the
state
that
the
person
has
a
fixed
opinion
against
capital
or
penitentiary
punishment
or
things
that
a
conviction
should
be
held
on
circumstantial
evidence
which
cause
a
challenge
may
be
proved
by
the
oath
of
the
person
or
by
other
evidence.
now,
there's
a
lot
of
difference
between
scruples
against
capital
punishment
and
a
fixed
opinion.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
i
believe,
you
--
on
that
case,
it
was
on
a
narrow
interpretation
of
this
particular
illinois
statute.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
they
had
scrupulous
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
well
that
is
our
contention.
what
is
a
fixed
opinion?
a
fixed
opinion,
we
just
look
to
the
dictionary
on
that
and
it's
affirm
or
not
movable,
established
opinion,
one
that
can't
be
changed.
the
fixed
opinion
against
capital
punishment
would
mean
that
under
no
circumstances
would
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
they
--
the
question
was
“do
you
have
a
fixed
opinion?”
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
i
don't
mean
that
and
again,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
if
you
interpreted
it.
no
the
jury
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
true.
they
have
a
fixed
opinion,
a
fixed
opinion
as
a
juror
would
indicate
one
who
under
no
circumstances
would
change
his
mind.
mr.
david
w.
clark
of
course,
that
question
wasn't
asked,
would
they
find
the
person
guilty
and
sentence
him
death
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
that
just
indicated
that
that's
what
they
all
thought
was
a
fixed
opinion.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
if
you
had
a
fixed
opinion
against
doing
a
certain
thing
when
--
anyway
--
based
on
that,
your
honor,
we
feel
that
a
certiorari
should
be
denied
in
this
case.
mr.
david
w.
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
conviction
arising
in
morgan
county,
alabama.
the
crime
was
committed
on
may,
1st,
1964
in
the
afternoon.
now,
right
after
this
murder
occurred,
the
police
arrested
this
young
man
and
there
was
some
evidence
brought
after
there
was
a
mob
but
actually
the
patrolman
testified
a
few
curious
to
seek
this
came
around.
they
held
this
young
man
until
captain
john
williams
to
talk
with
him.
now,
the
petitioner
testified
that
someone
of
the
officers
threatened
to
kill
him,
told
him
to
run
and
they'll
shoot
him.
now,
we
had
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
was
denied.
mr.
david
w.
clark
it's
the
point
that
i'm
going
to
bring
out.
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
in
the
district
court
in
montgomery,
we
had
an
officer
john
brom,
who
testified
and
that's
on
the
record
page
657
that,
no
one
pointed
a
gun
at
the
petitioner
and
no
one
spoke
to
him
at
the
crowd,
that's
on
the
record
page
64.
now,
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
sir,
because
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
billy
boulden
said
that
there
was
an
officer
good
in
another
--
another
patrolman
there.
well,
this
was
on
the
other
patrolman
there
and
he
testified
he
didn't
point
it,
didn't
see
nobody
pointed
a
gun,
didn't
hear
anybody
threat
him.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
and
of
course,
judge
johnson,
the
district
judge
had
to
identify
that
both
of
their
testimonies.
his
conclusion
was
after
him
been
denied
habeas
corpus.
now,
as
we
pointed
out,
this
--
the
boy
was
arrested
about
5:30,
i
believe
around
7
or
7:30
that
night
pursuant
to
an
order
of
the
circuit
judge,
this
young
man
was
moved
to
the
joining
county's
jail,
limestone
county
in
athens,
alabama.
here,
he
was
interrogated.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
it
was
a
precautionary
measure.
there
had
been
a
murder
of
a
popular
man
and
there
had
been
a
positive
of
rape
there
and
to
keep
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
security
matters.
it
was
a
short
distance
to
the
next
county.
mr.
david
w.
clark
now,
there
was
this
something
said
about
he
wasn't
warned
of
his
rights
at
that
time
before
this
first
confession
was
taken.
that
was
the
one
made
the
first
at
the
jail
in
athens,
alabama
that
night.
now,
i'm
calling
the
court's
attention
to,
i
believe
its
appendix
page
45,
where
the
question
captain
williams
i
believe
you
stated
earlier.
"you
advised
the
defendant,
he
didn't
have
to
make
a
statement
and
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
lawyer."
"is
that
correct?"
answer,
"i
did."
"on
may
1?"
"yes,
sir."
that's
the
record
page
45,
rather
appendix
page.
mr.
david
w.
clark
incidentally,
this
trial,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
murder
occurred
on
the
first
of
may.
mr.
david
w.
clark
and
the
trial
was
may
the
27th
through
the
29th.
mr.
david
w.
clark
of
'64
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
prior
to
escobedo
or
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
should
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
it
was
not
an
absolute
requirement
throughout
alabama
but
in
that
circuit,
judge
bloodworth
was
really
an
advanced
judge
in
thinking
at
that
time.
he
had
insisted
on
those
things.
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
it
wasn't
at
that
time
judge.
mr.
david
w.
clark
it
was
not
an
absolute
requirement
at
that
time.
now,
i
should
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
an
attorney
was
appointed
at
arraignment
on
may
the
7th
and
this
should
note
incidentally
filed
the
matters
to
the
indictment
and
the
case
was
heard
about
three
weeks
later
he
had
time
to
prepare
for
it.
now,
back
to
the
confession
on
the
eve
of
may
the
1st;
after
being
advised
of
these
rights
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
what
time?
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
believe
it
was
around
10:30
-
11
o'clock
somewhere
in
that.
mr.
david
w.
clark
at
night,
sir.
he
had
been
faired
and
was
permitted
to
the
bathroom
facilities
and
so
forth
and
allowed
to
smoke
in
those
things.
there
was
no
long
interrogation.
mr.
david
w.
clark
it
is
my
understanding,
mr.
watts
asking
those
questions
and
then
wrote
it
down.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
sir.
that's
--
that
was
written
in
the
confession
but
at
the
time
watts
testified
at
habeas
corpus,
he
said
that
he
asked
the
man
these
questions
and
wrote
it
down
ask
when
it
to.
now,
after
this
confession
was
given
which
incidentally
i
would
like
to
point
out,
neither
this
confession
nor
the
tape
recording
was
used
at
the
original
trial
on
may
27th.
on
the
next
morning,
may
the
2nd,
petitioner
was
taken
before
judge
james
bloodworth
and
advised
of
his
rights.
he
was
advised
of
fully.
i
believe
there
is
127
pages
in
the
record
showing
the
advice
he
gave.
he
had
a
hearing
that
morning
six
o'clock,
he
advised
him
seriousness
of
each
of
the
offenses,
he
advised
him
to
get
a
lawyer,
how
serious
the
crimes
were
possibility
of
a
death
sentence
and
he
talked
with
the
parents
and
relatives
of
the
boy
also
and
told
them
that
that
is
incorrect.
now,
after
this
hearing
and
i
believe
at
that
time,
the
family
was
endeavoring
to
get
sherman
powell,
a
local
attorney
to
represent
don
boulden.
they
were
not
successful.
now,
because
of
further
precautionary
measures,
judge
bloodworth
had
this
man
transferred
to
kilby
prison.
now,
then
may
6th,
the
man
was
brought
back
to
guilty.
he
had
been
indicted
for
on
three
indictments
murder,
rape,
and
robbery.
he
was
tried
on
murder.
they
brought
him
back
and
passed
through
common
and
then
it
passed
through
the
cave
where
he
reenacted
the
crime.
now,
a
transcript
of
that
tape
and
those
tapes
were
put
in
evidence
at
the
trial.
now,
as
this
case
occurred
before
either
escobedo
or
miranda,
the
totality
of
circumstances
the
rule
was
applied.
now,
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner,
he
cites
payne
versus
arkansas.
well,
i
think
that
is
one
that
really
shows
all
the
faults
here
was
a
case
of
a
19-year
old
person,
a
boy
who
was
denied
of
hearing,
was
arrested
first
without
a
warrant,
denied
a
hearing
before
a
magistrate,
who
could
advice
him
of
his
right
to
remain
silent
or
to
counsel.
he
was
not
advised
of
his
rights
by
the
court
in
arkansas.
he
was
held
incommunicado
for
three
days
without
advice
of
counsel,
friends,
relatives.
he
was
denied
food
for
long
periods,
threatened
with
mob
violence
and
so
forth.
now,
those
things
in
the
totality
of
both
circumstances
would
indicate
an
involuntary
confession
with
one
who
was
coerced.
such
was
not
the
case
as
boulden
found.
mr.
david
w.
clark
she
explained
that
she
had
been
raped.
mr.
david
w.
clark
she
had
him
raped,
as
they
say
and
that
she
complained
of
rape.
mr.
david
w.
clark
to
this
officer.
mr.
david
w.
clark
and
at
that
time,
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
she
ran
to
the
officer,
yes
and
got
behind
the
officer
hays.
mr.
david
w.
clark
behind
to
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
she
got
--
she
ran
and
got
behind
officer
hays,
who
the
conservation
officer.
mr.
david
w.
clark
oh,
no
sir.
after
hays
was
killed,
she
ran
to
the
highway
and
contacted
some
highway
patrolman.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir,
she
was.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
believe
she
did.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i'm
not
certain,
your
honor,
without
looking
at
the
big
record
which
i
don't
have
it
before.
mr.
david
w.
clark
i
don't
have
the
principal
--
she
ran
away
i
believe
before
he
had
actually
died,
the
conservation
officer.
she
ran
for
help.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
that
would
be
in
the
large
record
about
400
pages
it
was
sent
up
an
exhibit
a.
mr.
david
w.
clark
not
in
the
appendix,
no
sir.
and
i
believe
the
court
has
informed
us
that
your
honors
will
take
knowledge
of
that.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
sir.
of
course,
54
and
55
is
boulden's
statements.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
the
testimony
of
boulden.
now,
this
case
is
gone
to
the
district
court
on
federal
habeas
corpus
after
being
affirmed
by
supreme
court
of
alabama
in
anyone
up
to
the
fifth
circuit.
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
affirming
the
action
of
the
district
court
held
that
each
of
the
appellant's
statements,
his
actions,
the
facts
respecting
his
physical
and
mental
condition
and
environment
from
the
moment
of
his
arrest
to
the
end
of
the
last
interrogation
are
essential
fragments
are
passage
about
consideration
on
issue
of
voluntariness.
but
we
find
from
the
record
here,
no
possible
suggestion
that
boulden's
will
was
overborne
on
occasion
of
the
last
confession
by
having
made
earlier
ones.
now,
both
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
first
confession,
the
one
that
was
not
used
in
the
trial,
the
one
who
made
the
first
was
voluntary
and
also
that
the
second
one
was
also.
that
--
based
on
that,
they
held
that
under
the
totality
of
circumstances
rule
that
the
confession
was
voluntary.
now,
as
to
this
question
of
witherspoon,
as
mr.
moore
pointed
out,
witherspoon
took
place
after
we
had
filed
briefs
on
that.
however,
i
feel
that
the
objection
that
the
state
court
hasn't
had
a
chance
to
rule
on
it
would
be
a
waste
of
time,
if
we
went
back,
we
have
to
come
back
up
here
again
probably,
so
i
won't
press
that
objection.
i
would
like
to
point
out
on
the
witherspoon
case
that
the
illinois
statute
was
“in
trials
for
murder,
it
shall
be
caused
for
challenge
of
any
juror
who
shall
on
being
examined
state
that
he
has
conscientious
scrupulous
against
capital
punishment
or
that
he
is
opposed
to
this
thing.
now,
that
was
the
illinois
statute.
would
like
to
point
out
the
difference
of
our
side
of
section
36
and
57
in
alabama.
in
addition
to
about
12
grounds
that
were
challenged,
we
have
these
others
set
out
in
section
57.
on
the
trial,
for
any
offense
which
may
be
punished
capitally
or
by
imprisonment
and
penitentiary,
it
is
a
good
cause
of
challenge
by
the
state
that
the
person
has
a
fixed
opinion
against
capital
or
penitentiary
punishment
or
things
that
a
conviction
should
be
held
on
circumstantial
evidence
which
cause
a
challenge
may
be
proved
by
the
oath
of
the
person
or
by
other
evidence.
now,
there's
a
lot
of
difference
between
scruples
against
capital
punishment
and
a
fixed
opinion.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
i
believe,
you
--
on
that
case,
it
was
on
a
narrow
interpretation
of
this
particular
illinois
statute.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that
they
had
scrupulous
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
well
that
is
our
contention.
what
is
a
fixed
opinion?
a
fixed
opinion,
we
just
look
to
the
dictionary
on
that
and
it's
affirm
or
not
movable,
established
opinion,
one
that
can't
be
changed.
the
fixed
opinion
against
capital
punishment
would
mean
that
under
no
circumstances
would
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
they
--
the
question
was
“do
you
have
a
fixed
opinion?”
mr.
david
w.
clark
no,
i
don't
mean
that
and
again,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
if
you
interpreted
it.
no
the
jury
--
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
that's
true.
they
have
a
fixed
opinion,
a
fixed
opinion
as
a
juror
would
indicate
one
who
under
no
circumstances
would
change
his
mind.
mr.
david
w.
clark
of
course,
that
question
wasn't
asked,
would
they
find
the
person
guilty
and
sentence
him
death
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
w.
clark
well,
that
just
indicated
that
that's
what
they
all
thought
was
a
fixed
opinion.
mr.
david
w.
clark
yes,
if
you
had
a
fixed
opinion
against
doing
a
certain
thing
when
--
anyway
--
based
on
that,
your
honor,
we
feel
that
a
certiorari
should
be
denied
in
this
case.
