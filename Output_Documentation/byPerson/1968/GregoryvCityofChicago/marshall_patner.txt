mr.
marshall
patner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
where
the
failure
to
arrest
hecklers
resulted
in
suppression
of
free
speech
where
demonstrators
were
peaceful
and
where
the
hecklers
threatened
and
attacked
them
for
there
mere
presence
on
the
streets.
now,
the
defendant
in
between
65
and
70
or
80
other
people
in
august
of
1965,
conducted
a
protest
march
and
did
so
by
beginning
in
chicago's
lakefront
at
buckingham
fountain
then
went
to
the
city
hall,
paraded
there
and
then
marched
to
the
area
in
which
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
chicago
lives
called
bridgeport,
some
five
or
eight
miles
from
the
loop,
the
downtown
area.
when
they
arrived,
there
were
approximately
35
people
in
the
neighborhood
on
the
street.
they
marched
silently
in
the
evening
but
when
they
first
arrived,
they
sang
some
songs,
they
chanted,
made
several
kinds
of
remarks.
they
were
permitted
from
the
time
they
started
at
buckingham
fountain
to
city
hall,
to
the
mayor's
community
to
march
and
proceed
with
the
same
kinds
of
remarks,
the
same
kinds
of
singing
and
chanting
under
the
eyes
of
the
local
police
and
the
accompaniment
of
a
corporation
counsel
or
a
city
attorney.
after
they
had
marched
for
sometime
in
the
bridgeport
community,
at
a
request
of
a
police
commander
on
the
scene,
dick
gregory
who
took
charge
of
this
march
and
this
group,
agreed
with
the
request
of
the
commander
that
after
8:20
p.m.,
there
would
be
no
singing
and
no
chanting.
and
after
that
time,
there
was
no
conversation
whatsoever
by
the
marchers
directed
toward
the
spectators.
the
only
sound
whatsoever
made
except
for
walking
was
communication
by
gregory
to
the
people,
telling
them
that
he
was
marching
with
them,
telling
them
to
stay
in
line
to
obey
the
police
suggestion
of
where
they
should
march
and
they
did
so.
they
stayed
on
the
public
sidewalks,
except
when
interrupted
by
local
people
who
put
hoses
in
their
way.
those
were
removed
at
police
direction.
they
did
so
and
stop
when
one
heckler
stood
in
their
way
and
the
policeman
asked
him
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
he
did
so
and
then
they
proceeded.
when
a
countermarch
started
in
order
not
to
join
it,
they
changed
direction
for
a
block
or
so
and
then
resume
the
same
direction.
now,
while
they're
conduct
continued
to
be
peaceful,
the
crowd
began
to
gather
and
a
crescendo
grew
in
that
crowd.
now
the
hecklers
as
we
call
them
that
the
local
people
who
came
out
were
not
in
anyway
captives
of
these
peaceful
marchers.
the
marchers
never
made
any
noise
as
i
said
after
8:20.
they
never
sang
or
chanted
but
the
people
chose
from
--
to
grow
and
to
come
out.
the
group
grew
from
35
until
ultimately
there
may
have
been
1200
or
1400.
the
subject
to
this
demonstration
involved
criticism
of
the
then
superintendent
of
schools
of
the
city
of
chicago,
benjamin
willis
who
often
have
been
criticize
for
his
policies
and
racial
problems
in
the
city
schools,
an
issue
of
public
interest.
now
what
is
missing
from
the
opinion
below
which
affirm
the
jury
conviction
of
disorderly
conduct
on
two
counts
are
the
following.
there
was
no
invective
or
invitation
to
violence
by
the
peaceful
marchers,
sometimes
called
provocation.
there
was
no
effort
by
the
police
to
arrest
any
heckler.
all
of
the
police
in
this
case
were
awfully
good
in
trying
to
protect
the
marchers.
they
were
very
good
at
that
and
what's
interesting
about
this
case
i
think
a
bit
unusual
in
these
demonstration
of
cases.
we
have
very
little
dispute
with
the
facts
stated
by
the
illinois
supreme
court,
very
little
at
all
but
we
have
a
better
difference
with
the
city
who
seems
to
move
up
some
of
the
chanting
that
occurred
earlier,
and
so
it
appeared
after
8:20.
it
did
not
occur
after
8:20.
the
only
other
factual
if
i
can
get
rid
of
that
dispute
we
have
in
the
city.
they
say
that
there
was
a
crack
force
there
of
task
force
that
was
special,
that
was
specially
trained
to
go
out
and
deal
with
these
kind
of
things.
they
say
so
in
their
brief
but
at
page
33
of
the
appendix
--
that's
referring
to
the
page
of
the
appendix,
it's
103
of
the
record.
the
policeman
testified
that
they
have
no
special
training
at
all.
except
for
that,
this
is
not
a
case
that
involves
any
dispute
in
the
facts.
and
the
police
here
did
a
splendid
job
in
attempting
to
protect
the
marchers
as
they
went
around
the
mayor's
house.
mr.
marshall
patner
your
honor,
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record
if
he
was.
he
did
not
come
out.
it
does
not
appear
that
the
marchers
knew
whether
he
was
or
not
or
whether
anyone
knew
--
mr.
marshall
patner
it
does
not
sir.
it
may
as
well
have
been
to
get
to
the
residence
of
bridgeport
which
is
basically
or
wasn't
that
time
basically
a
white
community.
it
does
not
so
appear
--
i
think
it's
fair
to
infer
that
it
was
at
least
in
part
to
bring
this
home
to
the
mayor.
if
he
were
home
but
it
certainly
was
through
a
march
and
to
bring
it
home
to
the
mayor
and
to
the
people
of
the
city
of
chicago.
mr.
marshall
patner
it
may
have
been
brought
home
to
the
mayor
of
city
hall
also.
mr.
marshall
patner
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
that's
usually
where
he
is
during
business
hours
sir.
this
was
later
however,
they
did
not
get
to
bridgeport
until
after
the
normal
hours
of
city
hall
would
have
been
closed.
mr.
marshall
patner
subsequent
to
this
case
your
honor,
the
illinois
legislature
saw
fit
to
pass
such
a
statute.
at
the
time
of
this
occurrence,
it
was
neither
an
ordinance
nor
a
statute.
mr.
marshall
patner
the
statute
is
referred
to
in
our
brief
and
it
says
under
public
policy
that
in
respect
to
the
peace
and
good
order
of
communities
that
there
shall
be
no
demons
--
i'm
just
paraphrasing,
no
demonstrations
in
what
are
known
as
residential
neighborhoods.
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
it's
in
our
brief
and
i'll
find
the
page
in
a
moment
if
i
may
sir.
but
occurred
after
the
conviction
in
this
case
and
after
the
affirmance
--
mr.
marshall
patner
there
was
none
at
the
time
of
this
case
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
sir,
the
--
there
was
no
ordinance
or
statute
prohibiting
residential
picketing
which
is
what
i
was
mentioning
to
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
marshall
patner
no,
sir.
there
was
an
ordinance
of
the
city
of
chicago
requiring
a
parade
permit.
that's
the
only
kind
--
mr.
marshall
patner
there
was
no
request
for
a
permit.
there
was
no
permit
in
this
case.
mr.
marshall
patner
oh,
that
appears
your
honor
in
the
--
mr.
justice
in
the
reply
brief,
its
--
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
in
this
court
at
page
6
and
it's
to
be
granted
after
some
of
the
same
language
it
appears
in
many
of
this
after
a
30-day
notice
that
by
an
investigation
of
the
police
department
on
the
application
to
see
if
what's
said
in
it
is
true
and
to
determine
something
about
the
organization
requesting
the
right.
however,
no
permit
was
requested
and
there
were
never
--
the
marchers
in
this
case
never
would
charge
with
marching
without
a
parade
permit.
mr.
marshall
patner
they
were
charged
with
to
accounts
of
disorderly
conduct.
one
of
those
accounts
appears
to
be
that
they
were
--
that
they
caused
the
hecklers
by
their
mere
presence.
they
caused
the
hecklers
to
threaten
them
and
to
throw
rocks,
eggs,
bottles
and
they
hurl
epithets
--
to
swear
at
them
and
to
make
demeaning
comments.
and
the
second
count
was
that
their
purpose
was
unlawful
and
apparently
to
cause
those
people
to
congregate.
those
were
the
two
counts.
the
illinois
supreme
court
does
not
give
us
any
wisdom,
however,
in
which
of
the
counts
or
both
of
them
--
whether
it's
both
of
the
counts
that
they
are
dealing
with.
they
treat
this
as
a
single
conviction
in
their
opinion.
now,
those
two
counts
come
out
of
separate
provisions
of
the
illinois,
i'm
sorry
--
of
the
chicago
disorderly
conduct
ordinance
1931
which
is
printed
in
the
brief.
now
the
illinois
supreme
court
found
that
when
the
police
commander
at
the
scene
after
the
crowd
had
grown
to
about
1400,
asked
the
marchers
to
leave
and
he
asked
them
about
five
times
and
he
asked
them
clearly
and
pleasantly,
you
know,
responsibly
and
he
said,
“your
presence
here
will
cause
a
riot.”
and
speaking
through
mr.
gregory,
they
refused
to
leave
except
for
three
or
four
people
who
have
decided
to
accept
police
protection
and
we're
taking
through
the
crowd
and
left.
but
at
that
time,
the
conduct
of
the
marchers
had
remained
identical
to
what
have
previously
been
permitted.
the
only
change
was
that
the
crowd
grew
and
became
more
violent.
at
no
time,
and
this
is
not
disputed
i
think.
at
no
time
did
the
marchers
ever
make
any
gesture,
any
remark,
any
statement,
anything
of
incitement
whatsoever
to
those
hecklers.
they
marched
peacefully
--
mr.
marshall
patner
they're
marching
all
together
about
five
and
a
half
hours
but
somewhere
over
an
hour
in
the
community.
mr.
marshall
patner
a
little
earlier
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
what
--
mr.
marshall
patner
your
honor,
mr.
justice
the
--
in
this
case
because
the
marchers
remain
silent,
the
only
danger
of
the
riot
would
have
been
at
the
election
of
the
residence
who
have
come
out
and
attacked
them.
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
but
i
was
assuming
that
their
conduct
would
remain
as
it
had
from
8:20
as
being
absolutely
silent.
i
think
though
that
--
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
they
did,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
it
was
observed
exactly
except
for
when
that
the
three
instances
i
mentioned
when
hoses
were
put
in
their
way,
they
waited
until
they
were
removed.
when
one
neighbor
or
heckler
stood
in
their
way
and
the
police
asked
them
to
leave
and
he
did.
and
third,
when
a
countermarch
started
and
they
changed
their
direction
to
avoid
it
and
then
resume
exactly
the
original
route
set
out
by
the
police.
so
there
was
no
invective
or
invitation
to
violence
and
that
is
found
in
the
illinois
supreme
court.
there
was
no
effort.
mr.
marshall
patner
oh,
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
well,
no.
i
would
say,
i
--
my
answer
would
have
been
that
they
could
keep
going
because
they
were
silent.
i
think
--
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
i
--
mr.
marshall
patner
i
think
that's
right
but
the
struthers
case
is
not
so
different
because
there,
the
argument
was
made
that
ringing
door
bells
in
a
community
where
people
worked
all
night
should
be
prohibited
to
jehovah
witnesses
and
this
court
said
that
that
was
not
the
reason
to
stop
the
kind
of
first
amendment
activity
that
would
be
related
to
night
or
day
or
day
or
night
depending
on
how
people
were
in
their
activity.
but
my
implication
earlier
or
i
thought
i
had
said
that
they
could
go
on.
now,
there
was
no
effort
to
disperse
the
crowd
and
the
odd
thing
here
is
that
the
record
shows
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
finds
that
when
the
people
broke
through
and
the
police
grabbed
them
and
it
literally
says
in
the
illinois
supreme
court,
they
grabbed
them
--
the
police
grabbed
them
and
they
threw
them
back
into
the
crowd
and
did
not
arrest
a
single
one
of
those
man.
now,
the
tailor
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
in
the
illinois
supreme
court,
uses
to
avoid
our
argument
in
this
case,
says
that
in
a
vast
demonstration
that
when
the
police
asked
the
hecklers,
the
opposition
to
disperse
and
they
did
so,
there
was
no
violence.
well,
that's
what
would've
happened
here.
the
police
never
asserted
their
authority.
all
they
did
was
to
protect
our
people
but
they
never
arrested.
they
had
bullhorns,
they
never
asked
the
crowd
to
disperse.
mr.
marshall
patner
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
your
honor,
the
--
it's
very
close.
it
comes
up
to
the
edge
with
a
dramatic
difference
and
a
dramatic
--
and
an
essential
difference.
mr.
fainer
asked
the
people
in
the
crowd
as
the
facts
were
found,
there
were
some
dissents
in
that
finding
but
as
the
facts
were
found,
he
invited
some
kind
of
violence.
he
asked
the
people,
the
negro
members
of
his
audience
and
others
to
take
up
arms
and
fight
for
their
rights.
to
take
up
arms
was
the
difficulty
so
that
fainer
was
inviting
physical
acts
against
himself
or
against
the
other
members
of
that
crowd.
this
case
doesn't
make
it
under
fainer.
now,
if
it
would
be
my
position.
mr.
marshall
patner
their
presence
there
your
honor,
if
their
presence
invited
violence,
we
may
as
well
abolish
the
first
amendment.
that
would
mean
that
any
dissenter,
any
minority
man
either
way
invading
as
i'd
like
to
call
it
here,
a
community
would
be
provoking.
mr.
marshall
patner
i
think
you
do
not
although
i
would
prefer
that
you
do.
i
could
argue
also
that
the
fainer
case
that
we've
learned
now
that
the
kind
of
language
that
he
used
was
not
sufficient
to
be
provoking.
however
here,
there
is
no
language
like
that
--
in
this
case
--
just
fall
short
of
the
fainer
problem.
and
in
fainer,
there
is
that
provocation
and
that's
missing
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
opinion
and
it
is
never
argued
by
our
position
here
except
by
their
presence.
no
effort
by
the
police
to
disperse
where
mr.
justice
black
in
his
dissent
in
term
in
the
yellow,
i
think
put
it
very
aptly
where
it
fits
in
this
case
that
when
--
i'm
sorry
in
fainer,
i
misspoke
--
in
fainer.
the
man
in
fainer
says
to
the
police
officer,
“if
you
don't
get
that
sop
of
the
soapbox,
i'm
going
to
do
it.
and
what
did
the
policeman
do?
he
got
fainer
off
instead
of
getting
read
of
that
man
who
made
the
threat
and
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
--
mr.
marshall
patner
well,
he
is
the
one
who
threatened
him.
he
should
have
arrested
him
sir.
he
was
the
one
who
was
causing
--
mr.
marshall
patner
no,
that's
the
--
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
it
is
in
the
words.
mr.
marshall
patner
it's
not
the
words.
he
was
going
to
grab
them
and
remove
them
from
that
platform.
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
that
that
kind
of
activity
--
mr.
marshall
patner
that
kind
of
statement
--
yes,
i
mean
the
activity
that
he
is
talking
about.
that
kind
of
statement
is
distinguished
here
and
in
that
context,
if
the
police
have
to
do
anything,
he
is
the
one
to
remove
but
our
case
is
easier.
mr.
marshall
patner
and
they
took
some
--
i
think
then
they'd
have
to
take
--
mr.
marshall
patner
that's
all
sir
--
mr.
marshall
patner
--
and
no
one
has
heard
her.
i
think
that
would
not
be
enough
sir.
i
think
the
record
in
fainer
as
i
remember
it,
other
people
heard
this.
mr.
marshall
patner
and
a
lot
of
other
people.
mr.
marshall
patner
i
think
that
--
i
think
then
that
the
police
will
have
to
--
have
to
arrest
them
with
the
hostility
that
we
now
have
surrounding
the
circumstance
--
mr.
marshall
patner
--
because
there
were
many
factors.
mr.
marshall
patner
in
the
next
case?
if
it
comes
up
but
i
think
sir,
what
i
mean
though
is
--
if
--
in
a
number
of
variables
that
would
happen.
the
hostility
of
the
crowd,
the
reality
of
what
he
is
saying
whether
it's
clearly
flipping
to
a
hollow
threat
that
the
--
something
like
that
because
there
are
a
number
of
variable
factors.
but
if
the
police
in
this
case,
it's
easier.
because
here,
they
--
they
didn't
have
anybody
just
saying
something,
they
have
people
actually
breaking
police
lines,
being
grabbed
but
being
thrown
back.
now,
that's
the
difference
here
and
if
they
had
done
that
just
as
they
did
initially
when
this
began,
the
first
man
who
stepped
in
front
of
that
line
and
blocked
it
was
asked
by
the
police
to
leave
and
when
he
was
asked,
he
did
so.
it
--
we
could
assume
that
the
people
of
bridgeport
if
asked
by
the
police,
by
the
bullhorn
would
have
left
or
as
the
city
did
the
next
year,
if
they'd
arrested
those
violent
people,
not
--
they
say
they
couldn't
find
the
stone
throwers.
okay,
they
couldn't
find
them
but
if
the
people
who
broke
the
lines
were
taken
into
custody
as
an
example
because
they
themselves
had
done
something.
the
rest
probably
would
have
dispersed.
so
what
we
have
here
is
no
invective
or
invitation.
no
effort
by
the
police
to
protect
and
the
court
below
relies
in
this
case,
almost
totally,
and
mr.
justice
black's
dissent
in
fainer
but
out
of
context.
it
says,
this
--
the
illinois
supreme
court
says,
that
there's
an
obligation
to
protect
the
speaker
but
the
part
they
miss
that
comes
both
before
and
after
that
is
where
that
dissent
said.
the
obligation
is
to
protect
his
right
to
speak
and
that
is
a
dramatic
difference,
and
the
way
to
protect
the
right
to
speak
is
to
arrest
the
hecklers.
that's
the
part
of
this
case,
i
think
that's
important
and
this
has
become
an
issue
that's
grown
up
as
we've
come
to
this
court
of
great
national
significance
because
the
secretary
of
state
has
been
shouted
down,
the
senator
from
massachusetts
with
the
vice
president
has
been
shouted
down,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
has
been
shouted
down.
we
have
the
problem
in
columbia
--
mr.
marshall
patner
no,
sir.
i
was
saying
that
the
context
of
the
shouting
down
means
that
the
heckler
decides.
but
the
problem
--
the
difference
i
would
make
is
as
in
this
case
where
those
people
not
only
are
shouting
but
they
are
taking
some
physical
act
to
interfere.
the
next
question
is
really
the
hardest
one
i'm
sure
but
i
don't
think
we
reached
it
yet
in
this
case.
if
the
speaker
is
shouted
at
in
bad
taste
and
without
allowing
him
to
have
his
first
amendment
right
to
speak,
we
don't
have
that
here
because
what
we
have
here
is
a
physical
threat.
but
it's
ominous
in
those
other
cases
that
i've
just
mentioned.
and
what
happened
is,
the
police
decide
that
because
the
speech
by
its
nature
which
is
provoking,
using
provoking
now
in
the
other
sense
that
is
annoying
causing
dissent.
as
soon
as
that
happens
and
people
don't
like
it
and
they
get
violent,
the
more
violent
they
get,
the
more
right
they
have
to
suppress
and
terminate
the
speech
and
that's
why
we
use
the
term
that
we
think
was
aptly
coined
by
professor
kalven
at
the
university
of
chicago
in
his
book,
the
heckler's
veto.
and
we
think
that
the
heckler's
veto
is
what
happened
here.
now,
we
think
therefore
that
there's
the
--
what's
lacking
is
the
invective.
what's
lacking
is
the
effort
to
arrest
and
disperse
and
what's
lacking
is
the
obligation
to
protect
the
right
to
speak.
now,
we're
not
here
simply
to
tear
down
something
and
to
say
again
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
an
arrest
in
not
adequate,
the
conviction
is
not
adequate.
i
think
that
perhaps
there
are
some
obligations
to
suggest
something
positive
and
i
think
that
in
drawing
a
narrow
ordinance
as
the
court
has
asked
for
many
times,
it's
possible
to
do
so.
now,
the
city
argues
that
the
construction
below
is
such
a
narrow
construction
and
they
say
that
you're
bound
as
the
illinois
supreme
court
read
the
ordinance
to
take
it
as
though
that's
how
it
was
written.
but
in
writing
it
that
way
and
that's
the
last
page
of
our
certiorari
petition
where
the
appendix
sets
out
the
opinion
at
page
16
(a),
15
and
16
(a).
what's
missing
there
is
anything,
anything
at
all
by
the
speakers.
it's
all
imputed
to
them
by
the
violence
of
other
people.
now,
for
an
ordinance
were
written
and
i
don't
tend
to
be
addressed
with
this.
i
just
put
down
some
thoughts
that
said
something
like
this.
a
disorderly
conduct
is
that
doing
of
and
act
where
the
use
of
speech
or
other
conduct
which
includes
invective
fighting
words
--
i'm
trying
to
use
some
of
the
kinds
of
things
that
we've
taken
for
some
judicial
meaning
for,
which
includes
invective
or
fighting
words
or
gestures
that
are
menacing
or
otherwise
invite
violence
with
the
intent
to
cause
public
disorder
then
he
can
be
guilty.
but
none
of
those
elements
are
here.
what
we
have
only
are
instead,
--
not
our,
what
we
only
have
singly
is
when
the
policeman
who
has
attempted
to
protect
goes
up
and
--
came
quietly
and
politely
and
responsibly
says
leave
because
there's
going
to
be
violence.
if
you
don't
listen
to
him
under
the
illinois
supreme
court's
reading
of
the
ordinance
then
you
suddenly
become
guilty.
he
becomes
the
arbiter,
and
charge
in
the
whole
thing,
even
if
he
is
acting
a
good
faith.
but
he
has
made
a
mistake
here
in
not
trying
to
stop
the
violence
against
the
demonstrators.
so
i
think
that
an
ordinance
can
be
drafted,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
we're
looking
for
some
system
that's
chaos
at
all.
an
ordinance
can
be
drafted
to
accomplish
this
purpose.
mr.
marshall
patner
to
control
your
honor
the
speaker
who
would
invite
violence
directly
by
his
own
action
not
by
his
use
of
free
speech,
not
by
his
own
unpopularity
but
if
he
would
threaten
in
some
way.
if
he
would
invite
someone
to
take
up
arms,
taking
fainer
as
the
majority
took
it.
that
is
what
should
be
prohibited
and
that
can
be
done
by
a
narrow
ordinance.
mr.
marshall
patner
your
honor
it's
on
the
latter,
it's
that
the
disorderly
conducts
--
i
mean
as
applied,
it's
the
disorderly
conduct
ordinance
which
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
marshall
patner
because
it's
vague.
it
doesn't
tell
the
person
in
advance
whether
or
not
he
can
march
as
construed
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
on
the
spot.
it
gives
the
power
to
the
policeman
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
may
march
when
all
the
time
his
conduct
is
peaceful.
his
speech
is
protected
and
he
has
never
used
invective
or
invite
--
an
invitation
to
violence.
mr.
marshall
patner
that's
right,
so
that
it
was
protected,
and
as
such,
he
should
not
have
been
--
he
--
neither
he
nor
his
followers
should
have
been
convicted.
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
the
latter
your
honor.
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
the
latter.
now,
in
the
former
--
i
think
that
we've
seen
that
that
marches
of
any
size
can
be
orderly.
washington
has
a
march
of
the
greatest
magnitude
that
was
orderly.
i
don't
think
it's
the
size.
now
we've
asked
the
court
to
look
at
an
article
which
we
filed
that
appears
in
a
speech
journal
by
professor
heyman
which
talks
about
that
specifically,
it's
an
indictment
--
an
excellent
rendition
of
the
conflicting
interest
there
and
he
says
that
the
mere
size
of
the
crowd
and
i
think
he
documents
it
well,
the
mere
size
of
the
crowd
doesn't
change
in
anyway
their
rights.
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
if
they
are
silent,
if
they
are
under
police
surveillance
and
if
they
are
orderly.
mr.
marshall
patner
if
they
are
--
mr.
marshall
patner
each
of
those
things
would
be
relevant.
if
why
they're
marching
is
under
the
free
speech
and
if
their
conduct
is
the
kind
that
is
protected
and
if
that
is
--
i'm
sorry,
is
not
invective,
is
not
invitation
to
violence
if
--
it
may
not
be
popular
but
if
it's
not
invective
or
invitation.
mr.
marshall
patner
i
think
not
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
i
do
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
well,
there
are
--
mr.
marshall
patner
well
there,
are
they
--
mr.
marshall
patner
there
i
think
your
honor
the
--
there's
a
good
case
from
new
york
that
works
that
out,
the
levener
case
which
we've
cited,
l-e-v-e-n-e-r.
mr.
marshall
patner
no.
i
think
the
state
could
stop
it
if
it
wishes
as
they
did
in
cox
where
they
said
that
you
couldn't
march
at
the
courthouse
door.
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
under
those
narrow
circumstances
and
in
certain
areas
within
public
policy.
mr.
marshall
patner
there
--
mr.
marshall
patner
i
think
your
honor
that
the
--
if
the
legislation
that
you've
outlined
were
to
include
for
example
the
area
along
the
park,
that
--
it
would
clearly
be
banned.
mr.
marshall
patner
because
--
mr.
marshall
patner
the
public.
mr.
marshall
patner
the
government.
mr.
marshall
patner
that's
right
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
as
long
as
they
don't
conflict
with
the
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
marshall
patner
i'm
sorry.
i
think
if
i
understood
you
correctly.
the
park
is
basically
for
use
of
general
park
area
but
it
also
has
become
a
forum
for
--
for
speaking
and
a
forum
for
demonstrating
but
it
must
be
--
it
must
to
not
invite
violence.
mr.
marshall
patner
it's
--
it's
without
power
that
could
be
is
--
used
in
excess
or
arbitrarily.
that's
where
the
cox
case
--
mr.
marshall
patner
alright
sir,
in
this
way
if
we
begin
for
example
with
cox
where
the
prohibition
was
to
march
under
the
court
while
the
court
had
its
business.
now
that
--
the
state
certainly
has
the
right
to
do
because
there's
an
interference
with
that
kind
of
business.
but
we
work
away
from
that
and
when
we
get
to
the
point
where
the
only
reason
for
regulating
is
to
stop
the
demonstrating
then
sir,
i
would
use
the
term
arbitrary
or
i
would
say
that
it
was
an
excess
of
the
power
of
the
government
to
make
such
a
prohibition.
mr.
marshall
patner
no.
it
wouldn't
be
a
problem
of
equal
protection
--
mr.
marshall
patner
not
in
that
light
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
i
think
so
as
in
the
case
of
selma
march
where
as
long
as
there
can
be
legitimate
--
mr.
marshall
patner
well
it
was
--
mr.
marshall
patner
no,
sir.
but
--
but
if
there
--
the
law
was
passed
and
prohibited
in
all
circumstances,
i
think
it
would
be
bad
because
it
has
been
approved
in
the
selma
march
but
the
police
can
limit
the
way
it's
done.
mr.
marshall
patner
well,
if
they
stock
--
if
they
marched
in
the
road
with
high
speed
traffic,
i
think
under
then
--
under
the
police
power,
that
would
be
perfectly
fair
for
the
government
to
prohibit
it.
but
we
have
learned
--
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
that's
in
excess.
but
we
have
--
we've
learned
that
you
can
do
less
than
that
and
have
such
a
march
for
long
distance
by
marching
in
the
shoulder
or
in
one
lane
according
to
reasonable
limits.
mr.
marshall
patner
oh,
no.
not
in
that
kind
of
highway
because
there
you
even
have
the
prohibition
of
bicycles,
individuals
walking
and
the
marching
does
not
exceed
that
kind
of
thing
which
is
a
safety
kind
of
regulation.
mr.
marshall
patner
as
now
written
and
as
construed,
that's
exactly
my
position
sir.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
marshall
patner
thank
you
very
much,
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
where
the
failure
to
arrest
hecklers
resulted
in
suppression
of
free
speech
where
demonstrators
were
peaceful
and
where
the
hecklers
threatened
and
attacked
them
for
there
mere
presence
on
the
streets.
now,
the
defendant
in
between
65
and
70
or
80
other
people
in
august
of
1965,
conducted
a
protest
march
and
did
so
by
beginning
in
chicago's
lakefront
at
buckingham
fountain
then
went
to
the
city
hall,
paraded
there
and
then
marched
to
the
area
in
which
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
chicago
lives
called
bridgeport,
some
five
or
eight
miles
from
the
loop,
the
downtown
area.
when
they
arrived,
there
were
approximately
35
people
in
the
neighborhood
on
the
street.
they
marched
silently
in
the
evening
but
when
they
first
arrived,
they
sang
some
songs,
they
chanted,
made
several
kinds
of
remarks.
they
were
permitted
from
the
time
they
started
at
buckingham
fountain
to
city
hall,
to
the
mayor's
community
to
march
and
proceed
with
the
same
kinds
of
remarks,
the
same
kinds
of
singing
and
chanting
under
the
eyes
of
the
local
police
and
the
accompaniment
of
a
corporation
counsel
or
a
city
attorney.
after
they
had
marched
for
sometime
in
the
bridgeport
community,
at
a
request
of
a
police
commander
on
the
scene,
dick
gregory
who
took
charge
of
this
march
and
this
group,
agreed
with
the
request
of
the
commander
that
after
8:20
p.m.,
there
would
be
no
singing
and
no
chanting.
and
after
that
time,
there
was
no
conversation
whatsoever
by
the
marchers
directed
toward
the
spectators.
the
only
sound
whatsoever
made
except
for
walking
was
communication
by
gregory
to
the
people,
telling
them
that
he
was
marching
with
them,
telling
them
to
stay
in
line
to
obey
the
police
suggestion
of
where
they
should
march
and
they
did
so.
they
stayed
on
the
public
sidewalks,
except
when
interrupted
by
local
people
who
put
hoses
in
their
way.
those
were
removed
at
police
direction.
they
did
so
and
stop
when
one
heckler
stood
in
their
way
and
the
policeman
asked
him
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
he
did
so
and
then
they
proceeded.
when
a
countermarch
started
in
order
not
to
join
it,
they
changed
direction
for
a
block
or
so
and
then
resume
the
same
direction.
now,
while
they're
conduct
continued
to
be
peaceful,
the
crowd
began
to
gather
and
a
crescendo
grew
in
that
crowd.
now
the
hecklers
as
we
call
them
that
the
local
people
who
came
out
were
not
in
anyway
captives
of
these
peaceful
marchers.
the
marchers
never
made
any
noise
as
i
said
after
8:20.
they
never
sang
or
chanted
but
the
people
chose
from
--
to
grow
and
to
come
out.
the
group
grew
from
35
until
ultimately
there
may
have
been
1200
or
1400.
the
subject
to
this
demonstration
involved
criticism
of
the
then
superintendent
of
schools
of
the
city
of
chicago,
benjamin
willis
who
often
have
been
criticize
for
his
policies
and
racial
problems
in
the
city
schools,
an
issue
of
public
interest.
now
what
is
missing
from
the
opinion
below
which
affirm
the
jury
conviction
of
disorderly
conduct
on
two
counts
are
the
following.
there
was
no
invective
or
invitation
to
violence
by
the
peaceful
marchers,
sometimes
called
provocation.
there
was
no
effort
by
the
police
to
arrest
any
heckler.
all
of
the
police
in
this
case
were
awfully
good
in
trying
to
protect
the
marchers.
they
were
very
good
at
that
and
what's
interesting
about
this
case
i
think
a
bit
unusual
in
these
demonstration
of
cases.
we
have
very
little
dispute
with
the
facts
stated
by
the
illinois
supreme
court,
very
little
at
all
but
we
have
a
better
difference
with
the
city
who
seems
to
move
up
some
of
the
chanting
that
occurred
earlier,
and
so
it
appeared
after
8:20.
it
did
not
occur
after
8:20.
the
only
other
factual
if
i
can
get
rid
of
that
dispute
we
have
in
the
city.
they
say
that
there
was
a
crack
force
there
of
task
force
that
was
special,
that
was
specially
trained
to
go
out
and
deal
with
these
kind
of
things.
they
say
so
in
their
brief
but
at
page
33
of
the
appendix
--
that's
referring
to
the
page
of
the
appendix,
it's
103
of
the
record.
the
policeman
testified
that
they
have
no
special
training
at
all.
except
for
that,
this
is
not
a
case
that
involves
any
dispute
in
the
facts.
and
the
police
here
did
a
splendid
job
in
attempting
to
protect
the
marchers
as
they
went
around
the
mayor's
house.
mr.
marshall
patner
your
honor,
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record
if
he
was.
he
did
not
come
out.
it
does
not
appear
that
the
marchers
knew
whether
he
was
or
not
or
whether
anyone
knew
--
mr.
marshall
patner
it
does
not
sir.
it
may
as
well
have
been
to
get
to
the
residence
of
bridgeport
which
is
basically
or
wasn't
that
time
basically
a
white
community.
it
does
not
so
appear
--
i
think
it's
fair
to
infer
that
it
was
at
least
in
part
to
bring
this
home
to
the
mayor.
if
he
were
home
but
it
certainly
was
through
a
march
and
to
bring
it
home
to
the
mayor
and
to
the
people
of
the
city
of
chicago.
mr.
marshall
patner
it
may
have
been
brought
home
to
the
mayor
of
city
hall
also.
mr.
marshall
patner
that
does
not
appear
in
the
record.
that's
usually
where
he
is
during
business
hours
sir.
this
was
later
however,
they
did
not
get
to
bridgeport
until
after
the
normal
hours
of
city
hall
would
have
been
closed.
mr.
marshall
patner
subsequent
to
this
case
your
honor,
the
illinois
legislature
saw
fit
to
pass
such
a
statute.
at
the
time
of
this
occurrence,
it
was
neither
an
ordinance
nor
a
statute.
mr.
marshall
patner
the
statute
is
referred
to
in
our
brief
and
it
says
under
public
policy
that
in
respect
to
the
peace
and
good
order
of
communities
that
there
shall
be
no
demons
--
i'm
just
paraphrasing,
no
demonstrations
in
what
are
known
as
residential
neighborhoods.
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
it's
in
our
brief
and
i'll
find
the
page
in
a
moment
if
i
may
sir.
but
occurred
after
the
conviction
in
this
case
and
after
the
affirmance
--
mr.
marshall
patner
there
was
none
at
the
time
of
this
case
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
sir,
the
--
there
was
no
ordinance
or
statute
prohibiting
residential
picketing
which
is
what
i
was
mentioning
to
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
marshall
patner
no,
sir.
there
was
an
ordinance
of
the
city
of
chicago
requiring
a
parade
permit.
that's
the
only
kind
--
mr.
marshall
patner
there
was
no
request
for
a
permit.
there
was
no
permit
in
this
case.
mr.
marshall
patner
oh,
that
appears
your
honor
in
the
--
mr.
justice
in
the
reply
brief,
its
--
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
in
this
court
at
page
6
and
it's
to
be
granted
after
some
of
the
same
language
it
appears
in
many
of
this
after
a
30-day
notice
that
by
an
investigation
of
the
police
department
on
the
application
to
see
if
what's
said
in
it
is
true
and
to
determine
something
about
the
organization
requesting
the
right.
however,
no
permit
was
requested
and
there
were
never
--
the
marchers
in
this
case
never
would
charge
with
marching
without
a
parade
permit.
mr.
marshall
patner
they
were
charged
with
to
accounts
of
disorderly
conduct.
one
of
those
accounts
appears
to
be
that
they
were
--
that
they
caused
the
hecklers
by
their
mere
presence.
they
caused
the
hecklers
to
threaten
them
and
to
throw
rocks,
eggs,
bottles
and
they
hurl
epithets
--
to
swear
at
them
and
to
make
demeaning
comments.
and
the
second
count
was
that
their
purpose
was
unlawful
and
apparently
to
cause
those
people
to
congregate.
those
were
the
two
counts.
the
illinois
supreme
court
does
not
give
us
any
wisdom,
however,
in
which
of
the
counts
or
both
of
them
--
whether
it's
both
of
the
counts
that
they
are
dealing
with.
they
treat
this
as
a
single
conviction
in
their
opinion.
now,
those
two
counts
come
out
of
separate
provisions
of
the
illinois,
i'm
sorry
--
of
the
chicago
disorderly
conduct
ordinance
1931
which
is
printed
in
the
brief.
now
the
illinois
supreme
court
found
that
when
the
police
commander
at
the
scene
after
the
crowd
had
grown
to
about
1400,
asked
the
marchers
to
leave
and
he
asked
them
about
five
times
and
he
asked
them
clearly
and
pleasantly,
you
know,
responsibly
and
he
said,
“your
presence
here
will
cause
a
riot.”
and
speaking
through
mr.
gregory,
they
refused
to
leave
except
for
three
or
four
people
who
have
decided
to
accept
police
protection
and
we're
taking
through
the
crowd
and
left.
but
at
that
time,
the
conduct
of
the
marchers
had
remained
identical
to
what
have
previously
been
permitted.
the
only
change
was
that
the
crowd
grew
and
became
more
violent.
at
no
time,
and
this
is
not
disputed
i
think.
at
no
time
did
the
marchers
ever
make
any
gesture,
any
remark,
any
statement,
anything
of
incitement
whatsoever
to
those
hecklers.
they
marched
peacefully
--
mr.
marshall
patner
they're
marching
all
together
about
five
and
a
half
hours
but
somewhere
over
an
hour
in
the
community.
mr.
marshall
patner
a
little
earlier
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
what
--
mr.
marshall
patner
your
honor,
mr.
justice
the
--
in
this
case
because
the
marchers
remain
silent,
the
only
danger
of
the
riot
would
have
been
at
the
election
of
the
residence
who
have
come
out
and
attacked
them.
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
but
i
was
assuming
that
their
conduct
would
remain
as
it
had
from
8:20
as
being
absolutely
silent.
i
think
though
that
--
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
they
did,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
it
was
observed
exactly
except
for
when
that
the
three
instances
i
mentioned
when
hoses
were
put
in
their
way,
they
waited
until
they
were
removed.
when
one
neighbor
or
heckler
stood
in
their
way
and
the
police
asked
them
to
leave
and
he
did.
and
third,
when
a
countermarch
started
and
they
changed
their
direction
to
avoid
it
and
then
resume
exactly
the
original
route
set
out
by
the
police.
so
there
was
no
invective
or
invitation
to
violence
and
that
is
found
in
the
illinois
supreme
court.
there
was
no
effort.
mr.
marshall
patner
oh,
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
well,
no.
i
would
say,
i
--
my
answer
would
have
been
that
they
could
keep
going
because
they
were
silent.
i
think
--
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
i
--
mr.
marshall
patner
i
think
that's
right
but
the
struthers
case
is
not
so
different
because
there,
the
argument
was
made
that
ringing
door
bells
in
a
community
where
people
worked
all
night
should
be
prohibited
to
jehovah
witnesses
and
this
court
said
that
that
was
not
the
reason
to
stop
the
kind
of
first
amendment
activity
that
would
be
related
to
night
or
day
or
day
or
night
depending
on
how
people
were
in
their
activity.
but
my
implication
earlier
or
i
thought
i
had
said
that
they
could
go
on.
now,
there
was
no
effort
to
disperse
the
crowd
and
the
odd
thing
here
is
that
the
record
shows
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
finds
that
when
the
people
broke
through
and
the
police
grabbed
them
and
it
literally
says
in
the
illinois
supreme
court,
they
grabbed
them
--
the
police
grabbed
them
and
they
threw
them
back
into
the
crowd
and
did
not
arrest
a
single
one
of
those
man.
now,
the
tailor
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
in
the
illinois
supreme
court,
uses
to
avoid
our
argument
in
this
case,
says
that
in
a
vast
demonstration
that
when
the
police
asked
the
hecklers,
the
opposition
to
disperse
and
they
did
so,
there
was
no
violence.
well,
that's
what
would've
happened
here.
the
police
never
asserted
their
authority.
all
they
did
was
to
protect
our
people
but
they
never
arrested.
they
had
bullhorns,
they
never
asked
the
crowd
to
disperse.
mr.
marshall
patner
i'm
sorry
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
your
honor,
the
--
it's
very
close.
it
comes
up
to
the
edge
with
a
dramatic
difference
and
a
dramatic
--
and
an
essential
difference.
mr.
fainer
asked
the
people
in
the
crowd
as
the
facts
were
found,
there
were
some
dissents
in
that
finding
but
as
the
facts
were
found,
he
invited
some
kind
of
violence.
he
asked
the
people,
the
negro
members
of
his
audience
and
others
to
take
up
arms
and
fight
for
their
rights.
to
take
up
arms
was
the
difficulty
so
that
fainer
was
inviting
physical
acts
against
himself
or
against
the
other
members
of
that
crowd.
this
case
doesn't
make
it
under
fainer.
now,
if
it
would
be
my
position.
mr.
marshall
patner
their
presence
there
your
honor,
if
their
presence
invited
violence,
we
may
as
well
abolish
the
first
amendment.
that
would
mean
that
any
dissenter,
any
minority
man
either
way
invading
as
i'd
like
to
call
it
here,
a
community
would
be
provoking.
mr.
marshall
patner
i
think
you
do
not
although
i
would
prefer
that
you
do.
i
could
argue
also
that
the
fainer
case
that
we've
learned
now
that
the
kind
of
language
that
he
used
was
not
sufficient
to
be
provoking.
however
here,
there
is
no
language
like
that
--
in
this
case
--
just
fall
short
of
the
fainer
problem.
and
in
fainer,
there
is
that
provocation
and
that's
missing
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
opinion
and
it
is
never
argued
by
our
position
here
except
by
their
presence.
no
effort
by
the
police
to
disperse
where
mr.
justice
black
in
his
dissent
in
term
in
the
yellow,
i
think
put
it
very
aptly
where
it
fits
in
this
case
that
when
--
i'm
sorry
in
fainer,
i
misspoke
--
in
fainer.
the
man
in
fainer
says
to
the
police
officer,
“if
you
don't
get
that
sop
of
the
soapbox,
i'm
going
to
do
it.
and
what
did
the
policeman
do?
he
got
fainer
off
instead
of
getting
read
of
that
man
who
made
the
threat
and
mr.
justice
black
pointed
out
--
mr.
marshall
patner
well,
he
is
the
one
who
threatened
him.
he
should
have
arrested
him
sir.
he
was
the
one
who
was
causing
--
mr.
marshall
patner
no,
that's
the
--
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
it
is
in
the
words.
mr.
marshall
patner
it's
not
the
words.
he
was
going
to
grab
them
and
remove
them
from
that
platform.
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
that
that
kind
of
activity
--
mr.
marshall
patner
that
kind
of
statement
--
yes,
i
mean
the
activity
that
he
is
talking
about.
that
kind
of
statement
is
distinguished
here
and
in
that
context,
if
the
police
have
to
do
anything,
he
is
the
one
to
remove
but
our
case
is
easier.
mr.
marshall
patner
and
they
took
some
--
i
think
then
they'd
have
to
take
--
mr.
marshall
patner
that's
all
sir
--
mr.
marshall
patner
--
and
no
one
has
heard
her.
i
think
that
would
not
be
enough
sir.
i
think
the
record
in
fainer
as
i
remember
it,
other
people
heard
this.
mr.
marshall
patner
and
a
lot
of
other
people.
mr.
marshall
patner
i
think
that
--
i
think
then
that
the
police
will
have
to
--
have
to
arrest
them
with
the
hostility
that
we
now
have
surrounding
the
circumstance
--
mr.
marshall
patner
--
because
there
were
many
factors.
mr.
marshall
patner
in
the
next
case?
if
it
comes
up
but
i
think
sir,
what
i
mean
though
is
--
if
--
in
a
number
of
variables
that
would
happen.
the
hostility
of
the
crowd,
the
reality
of
what
he
is
saying
whether
it's
clearly
flipping
to
a
hollow
threat
that
the
--
something
like
that
because
there
are
a
number
of
variable
factors.
but
if
the
police
in
this
case,
it's
easier.
because
here,
they
--
they
didn't
have
anybody
just
saying
something,
they
have
people
actually
breaking
police
lines,
being
grabbed
but
being
thrown
back.
now,
that's
the
difference
here
and
if
they
had
done
that
just
as
they
did
initially
when
this
began,
the
first
man
who
stepped
in
front
of
that
line
and
blocked
it
was
asked
by
the
police
to
leave
and
when
he
was
asked,
he
did
so.
it
--
we
could
assume
that
the
people
of
bridgeport
if
asked
by
the
police,
by
the
bullhorn
would
have
left
or
as
the
city
did
the
next
year,
if
they'd
arrested
those
violent
people,
not
--
they
say
they
couldn't
find
the
stone
throwers.
okay,
they
couldn't
find
them
but
if
the
people
who
broke
the
lines
were
taken
into
custody
as
an
example
because
they
themselves
had
done
something.
the
rest
probably
would
have
dispersed.
so
what
we
have
here
is
no
invective
or
invitation.
no
effort
by
the
police
to
protect
and
the
court
below
relies
in
this
case,
almost
totally,
and
mr.
justice
black's
dissent
in
fainer
but
out
of
context.
it
says,
this
--
the
illinois
supreme
court
says,
that
there's
an
obligation
to
protect
the
speaker
but
the
part
they
miss
that
comes
both
before
and
after
that
is
where
that
dissent
said.
the
obligation
is
to
protect
his
right
to
speak
and
that
is
a
dramatic
difference,
and
the
way
to
protect
the
right
to
speak
is
to
arrest
the
hecklers.
that's
the
part
of
this
case,
i
think
that's
important
and
this
has
become
an
issue
that's
grown
up
as
we've
come
to
this
court
of
great
national
significance
because
the
secretary
of
state
has
been
shouted
down,
the
senator
from
massachusetts
with
the
vice
president
has
been
shouted
down,
the
secretary
of
agriculture
has
been
shouted
down.
we
have
the
problem
in
columbia
--
mr.
marshall
patner
no,
sir.
i
was
saying
that
the
context
of
the
shouting
down
means
that
the
heckler
decides.
but
the
problem
--
the
difference
i
would
make
is
as
in
this
case
where
those
people
not
only
are
shouting
but
they
are
taking
some
physical
act
to
interfere.
the
next
question
is
really
the
hardest
one
i'm
sure
but
i
don't
think
we
reached
it
yet
in
this
case.
if
the
speaker
is
shouted
at
in
bad
taste
and
without
allowing
him
to
have
his
first
amendment
right
to
speak,
we
don't
have
that
here
because
what
we
have
here
is
a
physical
threat.
but
it's
ominous
in
those
other
cases
that
i've
just
mentioned.
and
what
happened
is,
the
police
decide
that
because
the
speech
by
its
nature
which
is
provoking,
using
provoking
now
in
the
other
sense
that
is
annoying
causing
dissent.
as
soon
as
that
happens
and
people
don't
like
it
and
they
get
violent,
the
more
violent
they
get,
the
more
right
they
have
to
suppress
and
terminate
the
speech
and
that's
why
we
use
the
term
that
we
think
was
aptly
coined
by
professor
kalven
at
the
university
of
chicago
in
his
book,
the
heckler's
veto.
and
we
think
that
the
heckler's
veto
is
what
happened
here.
now,
we
think
therefore
that
there's
the
--
what's
lacking
is
the
invective.
what's
lacking
is
the
effort
to
arrest
and
disperse
and
what's
lacking
is
the
obligation
to
protect
the
right
to
speak.
now,
we're
not
here
simply
to
tear
down
something
and
to
say
again
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
an
arrest
in
not
adequate,
the
conviction
is
not
adequate.
i
think
that
perhaps
there
are
some
obligations
to
suggest
something
positive
and
i
think
that
in
drawing
a
narrow
ordinance
as
the
court
has
asked
for
many
times,
it's
possible
to
do
so.
now,
the
city
argues
that
the
construction
below
is
such
a
narrow
construction
and
they
say
that
you're
bound
as
the
illinois
supreme
court
read
the
ordinance
to
take
it
as
though
that's
how
it
was
written.
but
in
writing
it
that
way
and
that's
the
last
page
of
our
certiorari
petition
where
the
appendix
sets
out
the
opinion
at
page
16
(a),
15
and
16
(a).
what's
missing
there
is
anything,
anything
at
all
by
the
speakers.
it's
all
imputed
to
them
by
the
violence
of
other
people.
now,
for
an
ordinance
were
written
and
i
don't
tend
to
be
addressed
with
this.
i
just
put
down
some
thoughts
that
said
something
like
this.
a
disorderly
conduct
is
that
doing
of
and
act
where
the
use
of
speech
or
other
conduct
which
includes
invective
fighting
words
--
i'm
trying
to
use
some
of
the
kinds
of
things
that
we've
taken
for
some
judicial
meaning
for,
which
includes
invective
or
fighting
words
or
gestures
that
are
menacing
or
otherwise
invite
violence
with
the
intent
to
cause
public
disorder
then
he
can
be
guilty.
but
none
of
those
elements
are
here.
what
we
have
only
are
instead,
--
not
our,
what
we
only
have
singly
is
when
the
policeman
who
has
attempted
to
protect
goes
up
and
--
came
quietly
and
politely
and
responsibly
says
leave
because
there's
going
to
be
violence.
if
you
don't
listen
to
him
under
the
illinois
supreme
court's
reading
of
the
ordinance
then
you
suddenly
become
guilty.
he
becomes
the
arbiter,
and
charge
in
the
whole
thing,
even
if
he
is
acting
a
good
faith.
but
he
has
made
a
mistake
here
in
not
trying
to
stop
the
violence
against
the
demonstrators.
so
i
think
that
an
ordinance
can
be
drafted,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
we're
looking
for
some
system
that's
chaos
at
all.
an
ordinance
can
be
drafted
to
accomplish
this
purpose.
mr.
marshall
patner
to
control
your
honor
the
speaker
who
would
invite
violence
directly
by
his
own
action
not
by
his
use
of
free
speech,
not
by
his
own
unpopularity
but
if
he
would
threaten
in
some
way.
if
he
would
invite
someone
to
take
up
arms,
taking
fainer
as
the
majority
took
it.
that
is
what
should
be
prohibited
and
that
can
be
done
by
a
narrow
ordinance.
mr.
marshall
patner
your
honor
it's
on
the
latter,
it's
that
the
disorderly
conducts
--
i
mean
as
applied,
it's
the
disorderly
conduct
ordinance
which
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
marshall
patner
because
it's
vague.
it
doesn't
tell
the
person
in
advance
whether
or
not
he
can
march
as
construed
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
on
the
spot.
it
gives
the
power
to
the
policeman
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
may
march
when
all
the
time
his
conduct
is
peaceful.
his
speech
is
protected
and
he
has
never
used
invective
or
invite
--
an
invitation
to
violence.
mr.
marshall
patner
that's
right,
so
that
it
was
protected,
and
as
such,
he
should
not
have
been
--
he
--
neither
he
nor
his
followers
should
have
been
convicted.
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
the
latter
your
honor.
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
the
latter.
now,
in
the
former
--
i
think
that
we've
seen
that
that
marches
of
any
size
can
be
orderly.
washington
has
a
march
of
the
greatest
magnitude
that
was
orderly.
i
don't
think
it's
the
size.
now
we've
asked
the
court
to
look
at
an
article
which
we
filed
that
appears
in
a
speech
journal
by
professor
heyman
which
talks
about
that
specifically,
it's
an
indictment
--
an
excellent
rendition
of
the
conflicting
interest
there
and
he
says
that
the
mere
size
of
the
crowd
and
i
think
he
documents
it
well,
the
mere
size
of
the
crowd
doesn't
change
in
anyway
their
rights.
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
if
they
are
silent,
if
they
are
under
police
surveillance
and
if
they
are
orderly.
mr.
marshall
patner
if
they
are
--
mr.
marshall
patner
each
of
those
things
would
be
relevant.
if
why
they're
marching
is
under
the
free
speech
and
if
their
conduct
is
the
kind
that
is
protected
and
if
that
is
--
i'm
sorry,
is
not
invective,
is
not
invitation
to
violence
if
--
it
may
not
be
popular
but
if
it's
not
invective
or
invitation.
mr.
marshall
patner
i
think
not
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
i
do
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
well,
there
are
--
mr.
marshall
patner
well
there,
are
they
--
mr.
marshall
patner
there
i
think
your
honor
the
--
there's
a
good
case
from
new
york
that
works
that
out,
the
levener
case
which
we've
cited,
l-e-v-e-n-e-r.
mr.
marshall
patner
no.
i
think
the
state
could
stop
it
if
it
wishes
as
they
did
in
cox
where
they
said
that
you
couldn't
march
at
the
courthouse
door.
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
under
those
narrow
circumstances
and
in
certain
areas
within
public
policy.
mr.
marshall
patner
there
--
mr.
marshall
patner
i
think
your
honor
that
the
--
if
the
legislation
that
you've
outlined
were
to
include
for
example
the
area
along
the
park,
that
--
it
would
clearly
be
banned.
mr.
marshall
patner
because
--
mr.
marshall
patner
the
public.
mr.
marshall
patner
the
government.
mr.
marshall
patner
that's
right
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
as
long
as
they
don't
conflict
with
the
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
marshall
patner
i'm
sorry.
i
think
if
i
understood
you
correctly.
the
park
is
basically
for
use
of
general
park
area
but
it
also
has
become
a
forum
for
--
for
speaking
and
a
forum
for
demonstrating
but
it
must
be
--
it
must
to
not
invite
violence.
mr.
marshall
patner
it's
--
it's
without
power
that
could
be
is
--
used
in
excess
or
arbitrarily.
that's
where
the
cox
case
--
mr.
marshall
patner
alright
sir,
in
this
way
if
we
begin
for
example
with
cox
where
the
prohibition
was
to
march
under
the
court
while
the
court
had
its
business.
now
that
--
the
state
certainly
has
the
right
to
do
because
there's
an
interference
with
that
kind
of
business.
but
we
work
away
from
that
and
when
we
get
to
the
point
where
the
only
reason
for
regulating
is
to
stop
the
demonstrating
then
sir,
i
would
use
the
term
arbitrary
or
i
would
say
that
it
was
an
excess
of
the
power
of
the
government
to
make
such
a
prohibition.
mr.
marshall
patner
no.
it
wouldn't
be
a
problem
of
equal
protection
--
mr.
marshall
patner
not
in
that
light
sir.
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
i
think
so
as
in
the
case
of
selma
march
where
as
long
as
there
can
be
legitimate
--
mr.
marshall
patner
well
it
was
--
mr.
marshall
patner
no,
sir.
but
--
but
if
there
--
the
law
was
passed
and
prohibited
in
all
circumstances,
i
think
it
would
be
bad
because
it
has
been
approved
in
the
selma
march
but
the
police
can
limit
the
way
it's
done.
mr.
marshall
patner
well,
if
they
stock
--
if
they
marched
in
the
road
with
high
speed
traffic,
i
think
under
then
--
under
the
police
power,
that
would
be
perfectly
fair
for
the
government
to
prohibit
it.
but
we
have
learned
--
mr.
marshall
patner
yes,
sir.
that's
in
excess.
but
we
have
--
we've
learned
that
you
can
do
less
than
that
and
have
such
a
march
for
long
distance
by
marching
in
the
shoulder
or
in
one
lane
according
to
reasonable
limits.
mr.
marshall
patner
oh,
no.
not
in
that
kind
of
highway
because
there
you
even
have
the
prohibition
of
bicycles,
individuals
walking
and
the
marching
does
not
exceed
that
kind
of
thing
which
is
a
safety
kind
of
regulation.
mr.
marshall
patner
as
now
written
and
as
construed,
that's
exactly
my
position
sir.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
marshall
patner
thank
you
very
much,
sir.
