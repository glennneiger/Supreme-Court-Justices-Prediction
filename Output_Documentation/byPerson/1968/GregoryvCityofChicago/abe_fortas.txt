justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
city
ordinance
in
chicago
that
makes
a
distinction
with
respect
to
parades
and
demonstrations
in
residential
areas
as
compared
with
business
areas
or
other
types
of
areas?
justice
abe
fortas
what
did
the
statute
say?
justice
abe
fortas
how
long
the
--
how
long
were
they
marching
before
they
were
arrested?
justice
abe
fortas
suppose
they've
wanted
to
do
it
all
night,
all
night
long.
would
your
view
be
any
different
as
to
what
--
whether
they
might
have
been
--
whether
there
would
have
been
a
first
amendment
protection?
i
--
as
i
remember,
they
were
disbanded
around
10:00,
10:30
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
at
night.
justice
abe
fortas
and
suppose
they
had
continued
in
about
2:00
in
the
morning
as
the
police
said
--
had
said,
“well,
this
is
it.
you've
had
enough
and
there's
danger
here
of
riot
and
you're
disturbing
people
asleep
and
if
you
don't
leave,
we're
going
to
arrest
you.”
and
they
did
in
fact
arrest
some
of
them.
they
were
convicted
toward
disorderly
conduct.
justice
abe
fortas
in
short,
the
question
that
this
case
present
--
may
present,
i
don't
know.
it
may
present
as
to
whether
there
is
any
limit
to
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
what
is
otherwise
a
constitutionally
protected
right
to
demonstrate.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
they
did
a
certain
amount
of
singing,
didn't
they?
justice
abe
fortas
did
you
answer
my
question?
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
sorry,
it's
a
tough
one.
justice
abe
fortas
in
other
words,
you
don't
think
there's
any
limit
at
all
provided
that
they
don't
make
any
noise
except
whatever
noise
may
be
necessarily
incident
to
the
sound
of
feet
of
marchers
at
2:00
a.m.
in
residential
area
when
women
and
children
are
asleep.
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
justice
abe
fortas
what
do
you
mean
getting
rid
of
the
man
who
made
the
threat?
justice
abe
fortas
i
thought
one
doesn't
violate
his
first
amendment
rights
or
is
that
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
that's
sufficiently
close
--
that's
sufficiently
close
to
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
provide?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
he
didn't
do
it,
he
just
said
it
so
far
as
finding
--
justice
abe
fortas
that
kind
of
(inaudible),
that
kind
of
statement.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
mr.
gregory
or
somebody
had
said
to
the
police,
“if
you
don't
remove
those
people
who
are
obstructing
our
way,
we're
going
to
remove
them
ourselves.”
justice
abe
fortas
that's
all
--
that's
all
he
got
in
fainer
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
you've
got
in
fainer.
justice
abe
fortas
no,
i
--
no,
the
police
--
he
said
that
and
the
policeman
heard
it
and
a
lot
of
other
people
--
justice
abe
fortas
in
the
case
i
have
put
you.
justice
abe
fortas
will
you
remember
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
will
you
remember
what's
that?
justice
abe
fortas
mr.
simon,
apart
from
a
--
what
maybe
a
very
reasonable
response
in
the
circumstances
on
a
human
basis,
a
problem
that
we
have
of
course
is
a
problem
of
law
and
is
it
municipal
code
of
chicago,
section
193-1,
is
that
the
one
that's
--
under
which
these
petitioners
were
convicted?
justice
abe
fortas
and
would
you
turn
to
that
and
tell
us
the
specific
clause
that
is
applicable
here.
justice
abe
fortas
alright,
now,
let
me
ask
you.
is
it
the
city's
contention
that
the
convictions
here
are
based
upon
any
provision
in
that
part
of
the
code?
justice
abe
fortas
which
one?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
they
made
--
you
don't
say
that
they
made
improper
noise?
justice
abe
fortas
and
that's
the
way
they
construe
this
section?
justice
abe
fortas
and
we
don't
know
if
its
up
--
justice
abe
fortas
well
i
--
when
i
look
at
this
through
--
as
i
must
through
the
window
of
the
first
amendment,
i
have
a
little
problem
because
of
the
--
i
could
understand
that
that
might
--
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
might
conceivably,
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
be
proper
or
not
by
conceivably
advance
that
as
a
common
law
definition
of
breach
of
the
peace
if
there
is
such
thing.
by
looking
at
this
statute,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
base
of
this
record,
it's
arguable
that
the
applicable
provision
is
the
following
and
the
only
applicable
provision
that
it
is
a
misdemeanor
that
those
--
all
persons
commit
a
misdemeanor
who
shall
collect
in
bodies
or
crowds,
for
any
purpose
to
the
annoyance
or
disturbance
of
other
persons.
that's
arguable
if
that
is
the
applicable
provision
here,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
can
you
look
at
--
looking
--
forget
it,
for
the
moment
about
the
--
what
you
say
is
the
construction
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
is
there
--
did
these
people
make
an
improper
noises,
riots,
disturbances,
breach
of
the
peace
or
diversion
tending
through
a
breach
of
the
peace.
did
they?
justice
abe
fortas
because
you
said
he
is
so
charged.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
would
you
tell
me
what
there
is
in
the
record
that
supports
any
of
those
specific
provisions
in
the
code?
justice
abe
fortas
i
see.
now,
what
is
that,
an
improper
noise?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i
see
your
approach
to
this
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
you
can
understand
the
problem
that
i'm
raising,
i'm
sure.
justice
abe
fortas
because
on
this
record,
it
certainly
at
least
arguable.
justice
abe
fortas
and
if
you
look
at
the
specific
provision
of
the
language,
the
only
provision
that's
applicable
is
the
one
that
makes
the
crime
for
persons
to
collect
in
a
body
or
crowd
to
the
annoyance
or
disturbance
of
other
persons
and
perhaps
that
--
if
that
would
--
if
that
were
the
case
here,
i
suppose
you
had
agreed
that
that
would
present
a
very
substantial
constitutional
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
problem
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
lost,
i
am
entirely
--
i'm
entirely
familiar
with
that.
i'm
sure
you're
aware
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
there
is
a
problem
here
because
of
the
way
the
statute
is
--
justice
abe
fortas
is
there
any
city
ordinance
in
chicago
that
makes
a
