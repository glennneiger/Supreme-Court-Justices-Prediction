white
at
least
that's
what
--
at
least
that's
what
they
were
convicted
for.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
fact
the
--
there
might
have
been
--
you
don't
contend
then
on
this
case
that
the
city
or
the
state
is
relying
on
any
flat
ban
of
marches
in
residential
districts?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
some
marches
in
residential
districts
are
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
that's
--
there
is
no
ordinance,
i
gather
in
chicago.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
nor
was
any
other
statute
or
ordinance
which
ban
much
as
at
residential
districts.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
must
rely
on
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
absent
to
narrow
construction
--
narrowing
construction
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
would
you
still
urge
affirmance
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
argue
that
no
matter
how
big
your
broad
statute
might
be,
the
disorderly
conduct
statute
might
be,
the
conduct
that
mr.
gregory
engaged
in
was
clearly
within
the
statute
that
anybody
would
have
recognized
that
this
kind
of
conduct
would
have
been
covered
by
the
statute
even
though
there
might
be
some
other
conduct
that
might
be
on
the
fringe
and
unrecognizable
as
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
i
am
asking,
do
you
say
that
this
conduct
was
so
clearly
violative
of
this
general
language
as
to
be
in
the
core
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
have
urged
i
suppose
--
justice
byron

at

that's
what
