justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
are
you
really
saying
--
i'd
like
to
pursue
this
for
a
moment.
are
you
really
saying
that
people
who
have
shout
down
public
officials
despicable
as
that
conduct
may
be
are
subject
to
arrest
without
any
--
without
the
protection
from
first
amendment?
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
hugo
l.
black
which
purpose?
justice
hugo
l.
black
may
i
ask
you
whether
your
objection
to
this
conviction
here
is
based
on
the
fact
that
there
was
no
law
in
the
city
of
chicago
which
they
charged
him
with
violence
or
that
there
was
a
law
but
it
somehow
is
unconstitutional?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
than
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
the
constitutional
point
that
you
were
saying?
the
speech
was
not
--
was
what
you
call
peaceful,
that
is
he
wouldn't
--
shaking
his
fist
to
anybody
or
hitting
them?
justice
hugo
l.
black
are
you
taking
the
position
that
the
law
is
unconstitutional
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
because
the
state
has
no
power
to
stop
people
from
marching
by
thousands
or
hundreds
in
any
section
of
the
city
it
wants
to
on
its
streets.
are
you
taking
the
position
that
the
law
is
unconstitutional
because
it's
too
vague
and
uncertain?
justice
hugo
l.
black
there's
a
big
difference
to
me.
justice
hugo
l.
black
got
no
relevance
here?
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
mean
that
size
of
the
crowd
which
is
marching
around
in
the
city,
well,
you
have
said
at
night
has
nothing
to
do
with
it?
justice
hugo
l.
black
or
where
they're
marching?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they're
just
marching
around
and
around
the
mayor's
home
and
silent,
perfectly
silent
but
they're
marching
around
and
around
his
home
all
night.
what
would
you
say
about
that?
does
a
state
have
power
to
stop
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
think
not?
justice
hugo
l.
black
suppose
they
were
to
march
around
the
home
of
a
justice
of
this
court
because
of
--
in
his
decision?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
round
and
around
all
night,
500
of
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
is
there
a
constitution,
permits
the
state
from
stopping
that?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
should
work
it
out.
do
you
think
it
--
what
i
want
to
know
is,
are
you
taking
your
position
here
that
the
state
is
without
power
to
stop
that
if
it
wishes?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
then
i
understand
it
if
you're
saying
if
it
was
a
narrow
statute
--
a
statute
narrowing
the
drum
precisely
hitting
it,
you
do
not
claim
that
the
state
is
without
power
to
stop
this
marches
of
hundreds
of
people.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
why
would
it
have
to
be
certain
areas?
that's
getting
down
to
the
question
of
policy.
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
does
it
have
to
be
certain
areas?
justice
hugo
l.
black
why
would
it
clearly
be
banned?
justice
hugo
l.
black
who
owns
the
park?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
who
owns
it?
who
is
the
public?
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
their
--
the
government
represents
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
so
you
take
the
position
that
the
state
is
without
power
to
dedicate
that
park
to
the
purposes
it
wishes
to
dedicate
it
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
but
you
would
--
would
you
say
the
first
amendment
permits
them,
utilizing
the
park
for
purposes
other
than
speaking
and
marching
around
if
they
wish
to?
justice
hugo
l.
black
can
become
a
forum
but
do
you
mean,
the
state
creates
the
park
and
do
you
claim
that
the
state
is
without
power
to
say
what
it
should
be
used
for?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
it
is
beyond
my
comprehension.
arbitrary
means
nothing
to
me
except
but
the
people
who
are
passing
on
the
law
wanted
to
mean.
so
i'd
rather
you
discuss
it
without
using
the
word
arbitrary.
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
mean
if
it
was
aimed
to
a
certain
demonstrator
and
not
aimed
at
all?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
is
not
a
problem
of
equal
protection.
justice
hugo
l.
black
what
you're
saying
then
is
that
the
state
is
without
power
to
regulate
its
briefs
so
as
to
permit
them
to
be
used
only
for
the
purpose
of
legitimate
troubling.
justice
hugo
l.
black
with
it
(inaudible)
against
it,
did
they?
justice
hugo
l.
black
they
didn't
have
it
--
the
state
hadn't
attempted
to
pass
a
law
against
them.
justice
hugo
l.
black
do
you
mean
that
the
state
is
without
power
to
take
a
public
highway
which
is
necessary
for
the
public
good,
an
interstate
highway
that
the
state
without
power
to
prevent
that
from
being
marched
up
and
down
for
a
hundred
miles
by
the
people?
justice
hugo
l.
black
you
have
to
get
a
whole
army
to
protect
them,
wouldn't
you?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
what
the
state
should
do
or
what
the
government
should
do.
i'm
talking
about
what
it
is
powerless
to
do.
would
you
say
that
on
the
circumferential
highway
here
that
this
government
is
without
power
to
keep
people
from
marching
and
demonstrating
on
that
highway
by
the
thousands?
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
here
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
complaining
that
the
state
has
no
law
against
it,
which
can
cover
it
unless
you
are
far
vague
in
uncertain
statute
which
cannot
be
narrowly
limited
to
the
thing
they
want
to
protect.
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
depending
on
the
policeman's
order,
i
guess.
justice
hugo
l.
black
that's
depending
only
on
the
policeman's
order?
justice
hugo
l.
black
one
of
them
has
raised
--
would
be
a
law.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
if
one,
if
one
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
the
constitution
mr.
simon
permits
one
group
to
march
down
the
street,
advocating
its
view,
thus
the
constitution
permit
another
group
advocating
the
opposite
view
to
march
down
the
same
street?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
not
talking
--
i'd
say
there's
a
constitution
to
permit
one
to
march
to
advocate
his
views
and
not
permit
the
other
one.
justice
hugo
l.
black
but
isn't
the
act
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
given
the
answer
to
that,
that
when
you
permit
large
groups
to
march
down
the
street,
others
who
are
emotionally
concerned
on
the
other
side
are
likely
to
march
down
the
street
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
and
don't
you
create
situations
at
all
the
time
that
are
likely
to
cause
riots?
justice
hugo
l.
black
well,
what
--
why
are
they
not
if
there
are
--
two
are
--
opposite
one
another
injuring
and
stating
opposite
emotions
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
oh,
and
like
--
how
can
you
regulate
them
like
that
if
you
can't
regulate
them?
you're
going
to
let
one
have
a
better
place
that
the
other?
justice
hugo
l.
black
has
chicago
yet
passed
any
--
has
chicago
or
the
state
yet
passed
any
law?
justice
hugo
l.
black
i
mean
the
kind
of
law
that
this
court
has
been
admonishing
must
be
passed
in
this
field
for
years
in
narrowly
drawn,
nondiscriminatory
statute
acting
on
the
assumption
in
the
state
does
have
a
right
to
control
marchers
on
its
streets
and
demonstration.
has
it
drawn
one
like
that
yet?
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
is
that
to
all
--
justice
hugo
l.
black
--
nondiscriminatory?
justice
hugo
l.
black
it
has
done
that.
justice
hugo
l.
black
well
that
--
to
that
extent,
meets
it
seems
that
they
are
taking
note
of
the
fact
that
this
court
in
case
after
case
have
said,
statutes
must
be
narrowly
drawn
in
this
field
to
meet
a
particular
situation
hanging.
justice
hugo
l.
black
i'm
glad
to
hear
that.
justice
hugo
l.
