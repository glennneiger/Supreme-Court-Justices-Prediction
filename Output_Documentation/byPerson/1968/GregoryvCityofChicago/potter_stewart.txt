mr.
simon,
the
--
these
five
elements
that
you've
catalog
in
answering
my
brother
fortas'
question,
are
those
that
appear
on
page
33
of
your
brief
i
guess,
are
they
not?
and
are
taken
from
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
this
very
case
as
appears
on
page
--
they
excerpt
on
page
28
and
29
of
your
brief
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
any
foreshadowing
of
this
construction
of
the
ordinance
in
any
previous
supreme
court
of
illinois
cases?
justice
potter
stewart
how
about
this
case
of
chicago
against
joyce
back
in
1967.
there
is
no
foreshadowing
of
this
judicial
construction
of
the
ordinance
in
that
case,
was
there?
justice
potter
stewart
you're
of
course
on
sound
ground
so
far
as
the
decisions
of
this
court
go
in
such
cases
as
winters
and
in
cox
against
new
hampshire
that
a
construction
in
a
very
case
in
which
the
conviction
is
affirmed
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
is
efficient
to
remove
the
vagueness
from
the
statute
but
those
decisions
are
always
underneath
somewhat
and
i
wondered
if
there
was
any
foreshadowing
and
you'd
tell
us
that
there
was
none.
