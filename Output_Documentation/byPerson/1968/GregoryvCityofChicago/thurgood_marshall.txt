minute.
they

all?
justice
thurgood

did
they

justice
thurgood

did
they

justice
thurgood

did
they

justice
thurgood

who

--
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
were
disorderly
and
violating
the
ordinance
against
this
only
conduct
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
where
any
--
was
one
single
man
arrested
for
disorderly
conduct
on
the
other
side?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
throwing
of
rocks
disorderly
conduct
in
illinois?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
they
arrest
anybody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
didn't
even
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
did
they
arrest
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
the
one
man
that
deliberately
violated
the
rule
by
marching
across
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
in
front
of
everybody
else.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
you
said
you
pushed
him
back.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
wasn't
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
one
pushed
back.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
the
one
pushed
back?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
they
violated
the
disorderly
conduct
law
by
coming
through
the
police
lines?
justice
thurgood
marshall
were
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
well,
if
they
were,
weren't
they
for
they
were
not
arrested?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
it's
up
to
the
police?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
two
people
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
two
people
are
guilty
of
what
you
called
disorderly
conduct,
it's
up
to
the
police
to
which
side
he
shall
arrest?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
would
assume
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
that
would
be
much
easier
to
arrest
the
smaller
group
than
the
larger
group,
wouldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
does
the
court
have
to
convict?
assuming
that
the
police
made
a
judgment
that
it's
better
to
arrest
these
people
who
are
not
shouting
or
throwing
rocks
or
anything
rather
than
to
arrest
those
who
are
shouting
and
throwing
rocks
and
you
say
the
police
have
a
right
to
decide
which
one
is
to
arrest.
well,
even
on
that
assumption,
the
court
doesn't
have
to
convict
them.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
they
arrest
them
now
for
disobeying
the
order
of
the
police?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
say
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
anything
went
--
were
they
yelling
snake
when
they
were
arrested
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
or
anything
like
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
weren't
arrested.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
police
were
there
and
the
system
corroboration
council
was
there.
all
the
law
and
order
was
there
and
they
said
nothing
about
it
at
that
stage.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
simon,
what
protection
does
a
small
minority
group
have
in
the
community
where
the
majority
are
opposed
to
and
insofar
as
that
minority
is
right
of
freedom
of
speech
is
concern
under
the
rule
you
have
just
mentioned?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
of
today,
the
same
people
that
were
convicted
here
will
never
be
able
to
march
in
that
area?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
tomorrow
they
march
out
there
and
the
same
size
group
shows
up,
they'll
have
to
stop
marching.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,

the

thurgood

justice
thurgood
marshall
if
the
same
size
group
with
the
same
rocks
and
eggs
show
up,
the

is
over.
freedom
of
speech
is
gone.
justice
thurgood
marshall
only
if
we
uphold
this
decision.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
depends
on
who
is
the
more
disorderly
and
the
more
violent.
when
two
groups
confronting
each
other,
it
depends
on
which
one

lawless
and
the
more
violent.
