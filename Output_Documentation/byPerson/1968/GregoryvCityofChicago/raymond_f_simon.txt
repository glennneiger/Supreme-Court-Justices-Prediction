mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
300
years
ago
in
cox
versus
bernard,
sir
john
paul
said,
“let
us
consider
the
reason
of
the
case
for
nothing
is
law.
that
is
not
a
reason.
if
there's
a
single
threat
that's
woven
into
every
decision
of
this
court,
it's
that
there's
a
norm
of
reasonableness
that
causes
the
weight
of
opinion
to
shift
from
side
to
side
as
this
court
attempts
to
balance
individual
rights
in
societies
need
for
peace.”
in
the
instant
case,
there
are
12
very
cogent
reasons
to
support
the
city's
position.
the
expression
of
speech
is
in
the
form
of
a
march.
the
march
is
in
a
residential
community,
the
picketing
by
the
marchers
is
at
the
home
of
a
public
official.
the
public
official
in
this
case,
the
mayor
of
chicago
has
an
office
which
is
well-known
and
easily
accessible.
the
petitioners
demand
the
mayor,
fire
the
superintendent
of
schools,
an
action
clearly
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
mayor.
the
petitioners
in
speech
and
placard
called
the
mayor
a
snake
and
petitioner
gregory
threatened
to
march
in
the
mayors'
home
everyday
until
he
fire
the
superintendent
of
schools.
a
hundred
police
protected
60
to
85
marchers.
the
march
covered
between
five
and
five
and
a
half
hours
through
the
evening
rush
hour
and
after
darkness
had
fallen.
a
seasoned
commander
of
police
in
the
face
of
a
sudden
increase
and
the
number
of
threatening
hostile
spectators,
fearing
that
a
riot
would
occur
because
the
spectators
had
gathered
at
35th
in
union
--
35th
in
lowe
and
36th
in
union.
each
group
numbering
well
over
a
thousand,
angry
during
threatening
spectators
throwing
rocks
and
eggs,
shouting,
“get
out
of
here
and
let's
get
at
them.”
in
the
face
of
a
situation
which
a
seasoned
commander
of
police
said,
he
was
afraid
that
it
would
lead
to
a
riot.
he
apprised
petitioners
of
his
apprehensions
and
asked
for
their
cooperation
by
terminating
the
march
and
he
was
refused
the
way
he
asked
them
several
times
after
warning
that
if
the
march
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no.
certainly
not
only
in
part
of
it,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
there
is
a
law
mr.
justice
black
and
we
depend
on
it
and
we
depend
principally
in
this
case
upon
the
fact
that
the
police
commander
acted
in
the
face
of
an
incipient
riot
to
preserve
order.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
in
our
opinion
your
honor,
these
facts
have
to
be
considered
in
their
totality
to
understand
the
reason
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
we
have
to
contend
your
honor
that
the
answer
is
no
that
the
violation
of
the
law
occurred
when
the
commander
of
police
requested
the
marchers
to
desist
in
the
face
of
an
incipient
riot
situation
and
they
refused.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no.
we
--
we
don't
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
we
do
not
depend
on
it
but
we
seriously
question
the
wisdom
of
residential.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
today
there
is
a
state
statute
in
illinois
existing
mr.
justice
white.
it
was
not
in
existence
at
the
time
of
these
convictions.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
disorderly
conduct
ordinance.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
the
record
is
replete
with
instances
of
that
nature.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
police
closed
all
the
taverns
in
the
immediate
vicinity.
the
police
made
the
spectators
stand
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street.
the
police
would
not
permit
young
children
with
signs
supporting
the
mayor
from
joining
the
march.
the
police
took
a
neighborhood
person
who
stood
in
front
of
the
march
to
stop
it
and
remove
that
person.
the
record
shows
that
persons
were
standing
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
all
what
was
in
front
of
the
march
at
that
point
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
apologize.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice
black,
the
record
shows
that
persons
were
standing
in
their
doorway
and
the
police
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
they
didn't
arrest
any
person
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
there
is
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
mr.
justice
marshall.
no
person
was
arrested
nor
was
there
any
showing
that
there
was
the
violation
of
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
certainly
--
certainly
the
record
shows
that
the
police
did
everything
they
could
to
identify
the
person.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
but
the
record
points
out
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
they
made
every
effort
to
identify
them
and
the
commander
of
police
ordered
that
they
be
arrested
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
if
they
could
be
identified.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
when
he
was
asked
to
remove
himself,
he
cooperated
with
the
police.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
not
in
the
instance
where
he
was
standing
in
front
of
the
marchers.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice
marshall,
you're
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
you're
alluding
to
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
several
were
thrown
back
when
they
would
come
through
the
police
line.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
that's
not
an
issue
in
this
case
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
think
it
is
a
--
judgment
of
the
police
whether
that
was
disorderly
conduct,
whether
they
were
trying
to
cross
the
street
because
they
lived
in
the
community.
these
were
residence
of
a
community
whether
they
wanted
to
get
closer
to
shout
their
opinions
at
the
marchers.
the
police
thought
that
it
was
the
best
way
of
maintaining
order
to
take
the
neighborhood
people
and
make
them
stand
back
up
in
the
sidewalk
and
they
did
that
consistently.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
i'm
not
saying
it's
up
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
to
the
police,
it's
up
to
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
in
an
effort
to
maintain
order
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
police
have
to
make
these
determinations.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
this
was
in
the
face
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
record
shows
that
this
was
no
ordinary
situation.
this
was
an
incipient
riot.
the
dangerous
condition
was
acknowledged
by
counsel
for
the
petitioners.
we
don't
contend
that
the
police
could
not
have
arrested
some
or
all
of
the
spectators
and
have
made
legitimate
arrest.
what
we
contend
is
that
in
the
face
of
an
incipient
riot
situation,
the
decision
of
a
commander
of
police
where
everything
in
the
record
points
to
as
high
professional
qualifications
where
there
is
that
one
shred
of
evidence
indicating
antagonism
toward
the
marchers
that
this
decision
has
to
be
given
great
weight.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
only
if
they
believe
that
the
reasonable
or
only
if
they
believe
the
order
of
the
commander
of
police
should
have
been
obeyed
by
them,
the
way
it
was
obeyed
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
mr.
justice
marshall.
that's
not
what
i'm
contending
at
all.
i'm
contending
that
under
the
circumstances
when
a
riot
was
imminent
after
the
march
had
gone
on
for
five
and
a
half
hours
when
the
marchers
were
calling
the
mayor
as
snake
and
screaming
that
he
should
fire
the
superintendent
of
schools.
we're
contending
that
in
the
essence,
the
petitioners
were
the
hecklers
and
that
the
police
did
everything
they
could
possibly
do
to
protect
them
and
in
order
to
avoid
a
riot,
they
have
a
right
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
to
maintain
the
order.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
they
were
yelling
snake
for
approximately
45
minutes
earlier.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
correct
mr.
justice
marshall
and
the
reasonableness
of
that
lies
precisely
in
this,
between
9:00
and
9:30
the
records
shows
a
sudden
increase
in
the
number
of
hostile
threatening
spectators.
the
police
sergeant
said,
they
seem
to
be
coming
from
everywhere.
the
number
at
35th
in
lowe
was
well
over
a
thousand.
at
36th
in
lowe,
it
was
well
over
a
thousand.
the
commander
of
police
was
apprehensive
that
a
riot
would
occur
if
there
were
not
these
circumstances,
he
would
never
have
asked
the
petitioners
to
desist
their
march.
the
city
was
determined
to
resolve
all
doubts
in
favor
of
freedom
of
expression.
in
the
fainer
case
as
you
alluded
to
your
honor,
on
fireless
compelling
facts
and
the
instant
case
where
we
have
an
incipient
riot,
this
court
said,
the
police
do
not
have
to
proceed
against
the
crowd
no
matter
what
at
size
of
temper
in
order
to
satisfy
constitutional
demands.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
appoint
to
the
first
two
sections.
all
persons
who
shall
make
aid,
countenance
or
assist
in
making
any
improper
noise,
riot,
disturbance,
breach
of
the
peace
or
diversion
tending
to
breach
the
peace
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
the
first
--
the
entire
first
and
second
sections.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
have
to
answer
the
question
in
this
manner.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
the
highest
reviewing
court
of
the
state
said
that,
“disorderly
conduct
occurs
when
there
are
five
conditions
present.”
when
there
is
an
imminent
threat
of
violence
when
the
police
have
done
everything
they
can
reasonably
do
to
protect
the
demonstrators.
when
they
request
the
demonstrators
to
stop
and
for
when
they
explained
the
reason
for
making
the
request,
and
when
the
demonstrators
refuse
--
now,
we
contend
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
and
we
contend
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
that
what
we
we're
reviewing
in
this
court
is
not
this
section
but
it's
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
which
interprets
this
section
to
mean
those
five
things.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
it
is
indeed
the
gist
of
the
petitioner's
argument.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
your
honor,
we
did.
yes,
indeed
we
charge
both
of
these
sections.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
let's
repeat
the
recitation
of
calling
the
mayor
snake
in
front
of
this
home,
in
front
of
his
neighbors.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
think
all
of
these
would
be
action
tending
toward
--
to
a
diversion,
constituted
diversion
tending
to
a
breach
of
the
peace.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
certainly
can
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
it
is
but
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
only
if
the
court
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
only
if
the
court
were
not
to
adhere
to
winters
versus
new
york
where
this
court
said
that
the
construction
given
to
statute
or
ordinance
by
the
highest
reviewing
court
of
its
state
is
as
much
apart
as
if
it
were
specifically
written
in
and
where
the
court
said
that
a
defendant
is
as
chargeable
with
a
subsequent
judicial
decision
as
he
is
by
knowledge
of
the
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
that's
the
issue.
that's
the
issue
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
not
in
the
narrow
construction
which
is
applied
here,
no,
nor
in
the
specific
language.
however,
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
pointed
out
as
is
noted
underneath
that
the
courts
leave
to
the
pleader
the
specific
facts
which
would
bring
the
ordinance
within
operation
and
it
should
be
construed
in
the
light
of
the
facts
which
are
charged
as
a
violation
of
disorderly
conduct
and
not
by
speculation
of
facts
which
might
be
utilized
in
the
prosecution.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
by
foreshadowing
mr.
justice
stewart,
no.
the
specific
language
in
this
gregory
versus
city
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
is
not
foreshadowed
in
any
of
the
preceding
cases.
it's
an
excellently
written
narrow
compact
determination
of
what
disorderly
conduct
constitutes
in
this
context
but
it's
not
a
decision
based
upon
a
number
of
previous
precedents.
mr.
justice
stewart
is
correct
in
that
observation.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
in
a
very
scholarly
article
that's
written
by
professor
cayman.
this
court
has
furnished
the
background
of
the
events
which
led
to
this
march.
professor
cayman
points
out
that
for
almost
everyday
for
four
months,
there
were
marches
from
buckingham
fountain
in
grant
park
to
city
hall
where
the
mayor's
office
is.
he
points
out
further
that
on
several
days
proceeding
august
2nd
and
10
days
subsequent
to
august
2nd,
the
day
in
which
the
petitioners
were
arrested
for
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
gregory
led
similar
marches
around
the
mayor's
home
without
significant
event.
the
decisions
of
this
court
also
recognize
that
the
existence
of
an
organized
society,
maintaining
the
public
order
is
a
necessary
condition
for
the
exercise
of
constitutional
freedoms.
without
that
organized
society
maintaining
public
order,
no
freedom
can
be
exercised.
if
the
police
commander
had
made
a
miscalculation
in
these
circumstances,
the
results
could
have
been
disastrous.
we've
seen
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
i'm
fully
aware
of
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court,
construing
disorderly
conduct
ordinances
and
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
argue
the
naked
language
of
the
city
ordinance
without
those
decisions.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
mr.
justice
white,
certainly
we
wouldn't
contend
you
could
convict
him
in
for
an
unconstitutional
ordinance.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
i'm
sorry
mr.
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
to
avoid
a
riot
mr.
justice
white.
and
the
danger
of
the
situation
is
really
agreed
to
by
both
parties
to
avoid
a
riot,
the
decision
of
the
commander
of
police
must
be
given
great
weigh
and
specially
where
there
is
no
hostility
shown
in
the
record
nor
of
course
there's
any
exist
as
far
as
the
commander's
attitude
toward
the
demonstrators
where
all
of
the
evidence
shows,
this
man
was
on
the
police
department
for
33
years.
he
was
of
a
rank
of
both
captain
when
he
was
apprehensive,
when
he
was
afraid
a
riot
would
occur,
the
petitioners
ought
to
have
cooperated
with
his
reasonable
request.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
their
protection
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that,
the
police
must
make
every
reasonable
effort
to
restrain
the
spectators.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
as
i
recite
it.
making
them
stand
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street,
keeping
them
up
on
the
sidewalk,
not
permitting
them
to
join
the
march,
getting
them
into
their
house,
removing
a
sprinkle
from
the
sidewalk.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
certainly
not
mr.
justice
marshall.
it's
absolutely
not
true
and
that
it's
not
the
contention
here
and
on
several
days
preceding
and
on
10
days
subsequent.
mr.
gregory
did
lead
the
march
around
the
same
area
without
incident.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
absolutely
no.
only
if
there's
an
incipient
riot
and
that
means
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
that
the
police
have
no
advance
notice,
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
the
police
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
marshal
adequate
police
there.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
not
so
mr.
justice
marshall.
only
if
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
only
if
there
is
a
riot.
only
if
there
is
a
riot
which
is
so
incipient
that
the
commander
of
police
feels
that
the
public
order
has
to
be
maintained.
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
the
commander
of
police
made
an
error
and
a
riot
occurred
more
rights
than
freedom
of
speech
would
have
been
involved
in
this
case,
the
lives
of
demonstrators,
marchers
and
police
would
have
been
in
jeopardy.
it's
because
of
a
riot
situation.
not
because
the
ease
of
ushering
out
65
rather
taking
on
what
is
estimated
in
the
record
by
one
party
to
be
approximately
4,000
people.
clearly,
groups
of
1200
at
two
separate
locations
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
don't
think
that
that
is
a
fair
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
fair
characterization
of
the
city's
position
mr.
justice
marshall.
we
have
seen
how
ill-advice
arrest
in
a
tavern
in
detroit
or
for
a
traffic
offense
in
watts
has
had
disastrous
consequences
for
detroit
and
for
los
angeles.
the
commander
of
police
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
in
an
effort
to
preserve
order
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
no,
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
was
answering
your
first
question.
the
constitution
permits
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
both
sides
to
march
and
express
their
views.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
think
its
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
know
that
they're
likely
to
cause
riots
but
they
are
certainly
are
dangerous
situations.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
we've
always
taken
the
position
in
chicago
that
we
have
a
right
to
make
one
group
march
in
one
street
and
another
group
march
in
another
so
they
don't
clench
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
we
usually
let
the
one
that's
there
first
march
on
that
street.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
state
legislature
has
adopted
a
statute
prohibiting
residential
marching.
the
city
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
and
mr.
justice
black,
we
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
we
have
amended
our
disorderly
conduct
ordinance
to
reflect
this
narrow
construction
of
the
state
supreme
court
also.
abraham
lincoln
said
150
years
ago
that
the
world
is
--
has
never
had
a
good
definition
of
the
word
liberty
and
that
the
american
people
just
now
are
very
much
in
want
of
one.
he
said,
“we
all
declare
for
liberty
but
when
we
use
the
same
word,
we
do
not
all
mean
the
same
thing
by
it.”
and
professor
paul
for
in
writing
specifically
on
the
topic
of
civil
liberties
said,
“not
only
to
civil
liberties
vary
in
their
quality
but
in
many
cases
that
is
far
from
clear
with
which
side
the
entrance
of
civil
liberties
are
to
be
identified.”
your
honors,
for
five
and
a
half
hours
on
a
hot
august
day,
petitioners
exercised
their
right
of
free
speech.
they
call
the
mayor
a
snake.
they
demanded
that
he
fire
the
superintendent
of
schools.
they
came
across
loud
and
clear
as
the
record
indicates
they
could
be
heard
over
a
block
away.
they
had
been
in
the
immediate
residential
area
for
an
hour
and
a
half.
many
of
the
angry,
threatening
spectators
were
life
long
friends
of
the
daley
family
and
residents
of
the
community.
it
had
the
police
commander
ordered
them
to
disperse
they
could
have
at
least
deserved
an
equal
right
to
be
at
35th
in
lowe.
when
the
commander
explained
his
apprehensions
of
other
riots
in
mr.
gregory
and
asked
for
his
cooperation
in
terminating
the
march,
he
refused.
he
said
he
would
march
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time.
he
seemed
determined
that
he
would
march
until
he
was
removed
by
the
police
or
by
the
crowd.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
mr.
--
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
they
quit
at
8:30
and
they
were
arrested
at
9:30.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
our
contention
in
this
case
mr.
justice
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
precisely
in
the
language
of
the
illinois
supreme
court,
a
breach
of
the
peace
was
imminent.
the
police
had
protected
them
for
as
long
as
they
could.
they
asked
them
to
desist.
they
explain
why
they
wanted
them
to
desist
and
they
refused.
therein
lays
the
city's
contention
of
the
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
in
--
in
the
winters'
case,
this
court
pointed
out
that
they
are
as
chargeable
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
in
--
indeed
your
honor.
the
legal
answer
is
yes
that
they
are
as
charged
with
subsequent
judicial
determinations
as
they
are
with
knowledge
of
the
law
itself.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
oh,
no.
no,
i
was
answering
mr.
justice
stewart
that
no
previous
decisions
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
before
the
supreme
court
decision
in
the
gregory
case
had
held
that
but
we
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice
warren,
the
record
shows
that
after
legal
consultation,
the
commander
of
police
reluctantly
placed
them
under
arrest
after
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
which
have
been
pointed
out
in
the
argument.
we
contend
the
action
of
the
police
was
professional
and
competent
and
reasonable
and
lawful.
and
we
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
300
years
ago
in
cox
versus
bernard,
sir
john
paul
said,
“let
us
consider
the
reason
of
the
case
for
nothing
is
law.
that
is
not
a
reason.
if
there's
a
single
threat
that's
woven
into
every
decision
of
this
court,
it's
that
there's
a
norm
of
reasonableness
that
causes
the
weight
of
opinion
to
shift
from
side
to
side
as
this
court
attempts
to
balance
individual
rights
in
societies
need
for
peace.”
in
the
instant
case,
there
are
12
very
cogent
reasons
to
support
the
city's
position.
the
expression
of
speech
is
in
the
form
of
a
march.
the
march
is
in
a
residential
community,
the
picketing
by
the
marchers
is
at
the
home
of
a
public
official.
the
public
official
in
this
case,
the
mayor
of
chicago
has
an
office
which
is
well-known
and
easily
accessible.
the
petitioners
demand
the
mayor,
fire
the
superintendent
of
schools,
an
action
clearly
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
mayor.
the
petitioners
in
speech
and
placard
called
the
mayor
a
snake
and
petitioner
gregory
threatened
to
march
in
the
mayors'
home
everyday
until
he
fire
the
superintendent
of
schools.
a
hundred
police
protected
60
to
85
marchers.
the
march
covered
between
five
and
five
and
a
half
hours
through
the
evening
rush
hour
and
after
darkness
had
fallen.
a
seasoned
commander
of
police
in
the
face
of
a
sudden
increase
and
the
number
of
threatening
hostile
spectators,
fearing
that
a
riot
would
occur
because
the
spectators
had
gathered
at
35th
in
union
--
35th
in
lowe
and
36th
in
union.
each
group
numbering
well
over
a
thousand,
angry
during
threatening
spectators
throwing
rocks
and
eggs,
shouting,
“get
out
of
here
and
let's
get
at
them.”
in
the
face
of
a
situation
which
a
seasoned
commander
of
police
said,
he
was
afraid
that
it
would
lead
to
a
riot.
he
apprised
petitioners
of
his
apprehensions
and
asked
for
their
cooperation
by
terminating
the
march
and
he
was
refused
the
way
he
asked
them
several
times
after
warning
that
if
the
march
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no.
certainly
not
only
in
part
of
it,
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
there
is
a
law
mr.
justice
black
and
we
depend
on
it
and
we
depend
principally
in
this
case
upon
the
fact
that
the
police
commander
acted
in
the
face
of
an
incipient
riot
to
preserve
order.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
in
our
opinion
your
honor,
these
facts
have
to
be
considered
in
their
totality
to
understand
the
reason
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
we
have
to
contend
your
honor
that
the
answer
is
no
that
the
violation
of
the
law
occurred
when
the
commander
of
police
requested
the
marchers
to
desist
in
the
face
of
an
incipient
riot
situation
and
they
refused.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no.
we
--
we
don't
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
we
do
not
depend
on
it
but
we
seriously
question
the
wisdom
of
residential.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
today
there
is
a
state
statute
in
illinois
existing
mr.
justice
white.
it
was
not
in
existence
at
the
time
of
these
convictions.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
disorderly
conduct
ordinance.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
mr.
justice
black.
the
record
is
replete
with
instances
of
that
nature.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
police
closed
all
the
taverns
in
the
immediate
vicinity.
the
police
made
the
spectators
stand
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street.
the
police
would
not
permit
young
children
with
signs
supporting
the
mayor
from
joining
the
march.
the
police
took
a
neighborhood
person
who
stood
in
front
of
the
march
to
stop
it
and
remove
that
person.
the
record
shows
that
persons
were
standing
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
all
what
was
in
front
of
the
march
at
that
point
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
apologize.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice
black,
the
record
shows
that
persons
were
standing
in
their
doorway
and
the
police
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
they
didn't
arrest
any
person
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
there
is
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
mr.
justice
marshall.
no
person
was
arrested
nor
was
there
any
showing
that
there
was
the
violation
of
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
certainly
--
certainly
the
record
shows
that
the
police
did
everything
they
could
to
identify
the
person.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
but
the
record
points
out
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
they
made
every
effort
to
identify
them
and
the
commander
of
police
ordered
that
they
be
arrested
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
if
they
could
be
identified.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice
marshall
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
when
he
was
asked
to
remove
himself,
he
cooperated
with
the
police.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
not
in
the
instance
where
he
was
standing
in
front
of
the
marchers.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice
marshall,
you're
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
you're
alluding
to
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
several
were
thrown
back
when
they
would
come
through
the
police
line.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
that's
not
an
issue
in
this
case
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
think
it
is
a
--
judgment
of
the
police
whether
that
was
disorderly
conduct,
whether
they
were
trying
to
cross
the
street
because
they
lived
in
the
community.
these
were
residence
of
a
community
whether
they
wanted
to
get
closer
to
shout
their
opinions
at
the
marchers.
the
police
thought
that
it
was
the
best
way
of
maintaining
order
to
take
the
neighborhood
people
and
make
them
stand
back
up
in
the
sidewalk
and
they
did
that
consistently.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
i'm
not
saying
it's
up
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
to
the
police,
it's
up
to
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
in
an
effort
to
maintain
order
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
police
have
to
make
these
determinations.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
this
was
in
the
face
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
record
shows
that
this
was
no
ordinary
situation.
this
was
an
incipient
riot.
the
dangerous
condition
was
acknowledged
by
counsel
for
the
petitioners.
we
don't
contend
that
the
police
could
not
have
arrested
some
or
all
of
the
spectators
and
have
made
legitimate
arrest.
what
we
contend
is
that
in
the
face
of
an
incipient
riot
situation,
the
decision
of
a
commander
of
police
where
everything
in
the
record
points
to
as
high
professional
qualifications
where
there
is
that
one
shred
of
evidence
indicating
antagonism
toward
the
marchers
that
this
decision
has
to
be
given
great
weight.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
only
if
they
believe
that
the
reasonable
or
only
if
they
believe
the
order
of
the
commander
of
police
should
have
been
obeyed
by
them,
the
way
it
was
obeyed
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
mr.
justice
marshall.
that's
not
what
i'm
contending
at
all.
i'm
contending
that
under
the
circumstances
when
a
riot
was
imminent
after
the
march
had
gone
on
for
five
and
a
half
hours
when
the
marchers
were
calling
the
mayor
as
snake
and
screaming
that
he
should
fire
the
superintendent
of
schools.
we're
contending
that
in
the
essence,
the
petitioners
were
the
hecklers
and
that
the
police
did
everything
they
could
possibly
do
to
protect
them
and
in
order
to
avoid
a
riot,
they
have
a
right
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
to
maintain
the
order.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
they
were
yelling
snake
for
approximately
45
minutes
earlier.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
correct
mr.
justice
marshall
and
the
reasonableness
of
that
lies
precisely
in
this,
between
9:00
and
9:30
the
records
shows
a
sudden
increase
in
the
number
of
hostile
threatening
spectators.
the
police
sergeant
said,
they
seem
to
be
coming
from
everywhere.
the
number
at
35th
in
lowe
was
well
over
a
thousand.
at
36th
in
lowe,
it
was
well
over
a
thousand.
the
commander
of
police
was
apprehensive
that
a
riot
would
occur
if
there
were
not
these
circumstances,
he
would
never
have
asked
the
petitioners
to
desist
their
march.
the
city
was
determined
to
resolve
all
doubts
in
favor
of
freedom
of
expression.
in
the
fainer
case
as
you
alluded
to
your
honor,
on
fireless
compelling
facts
and
the
instant
case
where
we
have
an
incipient
riot,
this
court
said,
the
police
do
not
have
to
proceed
against
the
crowd
no
matter
what
at
size
of
temper
in
order
to
satisfy
constitutional
demands.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
mr.
justice
fortas.
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
appoint
to
the
first
two
sections.
all
persons
who
shall
make
aid,
countenance
or
assist
in
making
any
improper
noise,
riot,
disturbance,
breach
of
the
peace
or
diversion
tending
to
breach
the
peace
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
the
first
--
the
entire
first
and
second
sections.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
have
to
answer
the
question
in
this
manner.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
the
highest
reviewing
court
of
the
state
said
that,
“disorderly
conduct
occurs
when
there
are
five
conditions
present.”
when
there
is
an
imminent
threat
of
violence
when
the
police
have
done
everything
they
can
reasonably
do
to
protect
the
demonstrators.
when
they
request
the
demonstrators
to
stop
and
for
when
they
explained
the
reason
for
making
the
request,
and
when
the
demonstrators
refuse
--
now,
we
contend
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
and
we
contend
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
that
what
we
we're
reviewing
in
this
court
is
not
this
section
but
it's
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
which
interprets
this
section
to
mean
those
five
things.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
it
is
indeed
the
gist
of
the
petitioner's
argument.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
your
honor,
we
did.
yes,
indeed
we
charge
both
of
these
sections.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
let's
repeat
the
recitation
of
calling
the
mayor
snake
in
front
of
this
home,
in
front
of
his
neighbors.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
think
all
of
these
would
be
action
tending
toward
--
to
a
diversion,
constituted
diversion
tending
to
a
breach
of
the
peace.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
certainly
can
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
it
is
but
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
only
if
the
court
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
only
if
the
court
were
not
to
adhere
to
winters
versus
new
york
where
this
court
said
that
the
construction
given
to
statute
or
ordinance
by
the
highest
reviewing
court
of
its
state
is
as
much
apart
as
if
it
were
specifically
written
in
and
where
the
court
said
that
a
defendant
is
as
chargeable
with
a
subsequent
judicial
decision
as
he
is
by
knowledge
of
the
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
that's
the
issue.
that's
the
issue
mr.
justice
fortas.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
not
in
the
narrow
construction
which
is
applied
here,
no,
nor
in
the
specific
language.
however,
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
pointed
out
as
is
noted
underneath
that
the
courts
leave
to
the
pleader
the
specific
facts
which
would
bring
the
ordinance
within
operation
and
it
should
be
construed
in
the
light
of
the
facts
which
are
charged
as
a
violation
of
disorderly
conduct
and
not
by
speculation
of
facts
which
might
be
utilized
in
the
prosecution.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
by
foreshadowing
mr.
justice
stewart,
no.
the
specific
language
in
this
gregory
versus
city
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
is
not
foreshadowed
in
any
of
the
preceding
cases.
it's
an
excellently
written
narrow
compact
determination
of
what
disorderly
conduct
constitutes
in
this
context
but
it's
not
a
decision
based
upon
a
number
of
previous
precedents.
mr.
justice
stewart
is
correct
in
that
observation.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
in
a
very
scholarly
article
that's
written
by
professor
cayman.
this
court
has
furnished
the
background
of
the
events
which
led
to
this
march.
professor
cayman
points
out
that
for
almost
everyday
for
four
months,
there
were
marches
from
buckingham
fountain
in
grant
park
to
city
hall
where
the
mayor's
office
is.
he
points
out
further
that
on
several
days
proceeding
august
2nd
and
10
days
subsequent
to
august
2nd,
the
day
in
which
the
petitioners
were
arrested
for
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
gregory
led
similar
marches
around
the
mayor's
home
without
significant
event.
the
decisions
of
this
court
also
recognize
that
the
existence
of
an
organized
society,
maintaining
the
public
order
is
a
necessary
condition
for
the
exercise
of
constitutional
freedoms.
without
that
organized
society
maintaining
public
order,
no
freedom
can
be
exercised.
if
the
police
commander
had
made
a
miscalculation
in
these
circumstances,
the
results
could
have
been
disastrous.
we've
seen
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
i'm
fully
aware
of
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court,
construing
disorderly
conduct
ordinances
and
i
would
be
hard
pressed
to
argue
the
naked
language
of
the
city
ordinance
without
those
decisions.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
mr.
justice
white,
certainly
we
wouldn't
contend
you
could
convict
him
in
for
an
unconstitutional
ordinance.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes,
i'm
sorry
mr.
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
to
avoid
a
riot
mr.
justice
white.
and
the
danger
of
the
situation
is
really
agreed
to
by
both
parties
to
avoid
a
riot,
the
decision
of
the
commander
of
police
must
be
given
great
weigh
and
specially
where
there
is
no
hostility
shown
in
the
record
nor
of
course
there's
any
exist
as
far
as
the
commander's
attitude
toward
the
demonstrators
where
all
of
the
evidence
shows,
this
man
was
on
the
police
department
for
33
years.
he
was
of
a
rank
of
both
captain
when
he
was
apprehensive,
when
he
was
afraid
a
riot
would
occur,
the
petitioners
ought
to
have
cooperated
with
his
reasonable
request.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
their
protection
mr.
justice
marshall
is
that,
the
police
must
make
every
reasonable
effort
to
restrain
the
spectators.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
as
i
recite
it.
making
them
stand
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street,
keeping
them
up
on
the
sidewalk,
not
permitting
them
to
join
the
march,
getting
them
into
their
house,
removing
a
sprinkle
from
the
sidewalk.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
certainly
not
mr.
justice
marshall.
it's
absolutely
not
true
and
that
it's
not
the
contention
here
and
on
several
days
preceding
and
on
10
days
subsequent.
mr.
gregory
did
lead
the
march
around
the
same
area
without
incident.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
absolutely
no.
only
if
there's
an
incipient
riot
and
that
means
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
that
the
police
have
no
advance
notice,
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
the
police
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
marshal
adequate
police
there.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
not
so
mr.
justice
marshall.
only
if
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
only
if
there
is
a
riot.
only
if
there
is
a
riot
which
is
so
incipient
that
the
commander
of
police
feels
that
the
public
order
has
to
be
maintained.
mr.
justice
marshall,
if
the
commander
of
police
made
an
error
and
a
riot
occurred
more
rights
than
freedom
of
speech
would
have
been
involved
in
this
case,
the
lives
of
demonstrators,
marchers
and
police
would
have
been
in
jeopardy.
it's
because
of
a
riot
situation.
not
because
the
ease
of
ushering
out
65
rather
taking
on
what
is
estimated
in
the
record
by
one
party
to
be
approximately
4,000
people.
clearly,
groups
of
1200
at
two
separate
locations
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
i
don't
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
don't
think
that
that
is
a
fair
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
fair
characterization
of
the
city's
position
mr.
justice
marshall.
we
have
seen
how
ill-advice
arrest
in
a
tavern
in
detroit
or
for
a
traffic
offense
in
watts
has
had
disastrous
consequences
for
detroit
and
for
los
angeles.
the
commander
of
police
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
in
an
effort
to
preserve
order
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
no,
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
was
answering
your
first
question.
the
constitution
permits
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
both
sides
to
march
and
express
their
views.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
i
think
its
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
well,
mr.
justice
black,
i
don't
know
that
they're
likely
to
cause
riots
but
they
are
certainly
are
dangerous
situations.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
we've
always
taken
the
position
in
chicago
that
we
have
a
right
to
make
one
group
march
in
one
street
and
another
group
march
in
another
so
they
don't
clench
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
we
usually
let
the
one
that's
there
first
march
on
that
street.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
the
state
legislature
has
adopted
a
statute
prohibiting
residential
marching.
the
city
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
and
mr.
justice
black,
we
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
we
have
amended
our
disorderly
conduct
ordinance
to
reflect
this
narrow
construction
of
the
state
supreme
court
also.
abraham
lincoln
said
150
years
ago
that
the
world
is
--
has
never
had
a
good
definition
of
the
word
liberty
and
that
the
american
people
just
now
are
very
much
in
want
of
one.
he
said,
“we
all
declare
for
liberty
but
when
we
use
the
same
word,
we
do
not
all
mean
the
same
thing
by
it.”
and
professor
paul
for
in
writing
specifically
on
the
topic
of
civil
liberties
said,
“not
only
to
civil
liberties
vary
in
their
quality
but
in
many
cases
that
is
far
from
clear
with
which
side
the
entrance
of
civil
liberties
are
to
be
identified.”
your
honors,
for
five
and
a
half
hours
on
a
hot
august
day,
petitioners
exercised
their
right
of
free
speech.
they
call
the
mayor
a
snake.
they
demanded
that
he
fire
the
superintendent
of
schools.
they
came
across
loud
and
clear
as
the
record
indicates
they
could
be
heard
over
a
block
away.
they
had
been
in
the
immediate
residential
area
for
an
hour
and
a
half.
many
of
the
angry,
threatening
spectators
were
life
long
friends
of
the
daley
family
and
residents
of
the
community.
it
had
the
police
commander
ordered
them
to
disperse
they
could
have
at
least
deserved
an
equal
right
to
be
at
35th
in
lowe.
when
the
commander
explained
his
apprehensions
of
other
riots
in
mr.
gregory
and
asked
for
his
cooperation
in
terminating
the
march,
he
refused.
he
said
he
would
march
for
an
indefinite
period
of
time.
he
seemed
determined
that
he
would
march
until
he
was
removed
by
the
police
or
by
the
crowd.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
no,
mr.
--
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
they
quit
at
8:30
and
they
were
arrested
at
9:30.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
our
contention
in
this
case
mr.
justice
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
precisely
in
the
language
of
the
illinois
supreme
court,
a
breach
of
the
peace
was
imminent.
the
police
had
protected
them
for
as
long
as
they
could.
they
asked
them
to
desist.
they
explain
why
they
wanted
them
to
desist
and
they
refused.
therein
lays
the
city's
contention
of
the
disorderly
conduct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
in
--
in
the
winters'
case,
this
court
pointed
out
that
they
are
as
chargeable
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
in
--
indeed
your
honor.
the
legal
answer
is
yes
that
they
are
as
charged
with
subsequent
judicial
determinations
as
they
are
with
knowledge
of
the
law
itself.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
oh,
no.
no,
i
was
answering
mr.
justice
stewart
that
no
previous
decisions
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
--
before
the
supreme
court
decision
in
the
gregory
case
had
held
that
but
we
--
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
yes.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
f.
simon
mr.
justice
warren,
the
record
shows
that
after
legal
consultation,
the
commander
of
police
reluctantly
placed
them
under
arrest
after
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
which
have
been
pointed
out
in
the
argument.
we
contend
the
action
of
the
police
was
professional
and
competent
and
reasonable
and
lawful.
and
we
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
