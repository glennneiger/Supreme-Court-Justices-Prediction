justice

what
was
the
--
it
was
the
breaking
into
the
woman's
home
the
same
--
the
same
--
part
of
the
same
offense
--
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
now
been
tried
and
convicted?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
your
argument
which
set
was
used?
justice
potter
stewart
then
on
december
12
which
you
did
not
tell
us
was
the
time
when
the
fingerprints
were,
they
were
actually
used.
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
the
testimony
about
that
episode,
i
mean
about
the
circumstances
of
the
arrest
that
you
quoted
now?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
do
have
what
appears
to
be
her
positive
identification
of
him
made
under
oath
appearing
at
page
5
of
your
brief
and
certainly
now,
if
this
conviction
was
reverse,
there
would
be
plenty
of
probable
cause
to
arrest,
wouldn't
that
be?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
she
says
no
doubt
in
mind
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
page
5
of
your
brief.
justice
potter
stewart
over
yonder
in
that
white
shirt,
yes
sir
that's
him,
no
doubt
in
mind
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
your
argument
is
entirely
based
on
the
fourth
amendment
aspects
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
justice
potter
stewart
entirely?
justice
potter
stewart
not
at
all
on
the
fifth
amendment
aspect
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
nor
on
generalized
due
process?
justice
potter
stewart
exclusively
on
the
fourth,
on
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
illegal
arrest?
justice
potter
stewart
he
--
what
else
happened
during
this
period
of
detention?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
just
wondered,
it
can
be
argued
i
suppose
that
the
--
that
these
fingerprints
were
not
the
--
were
not
the
result
of
the
arrest
necessarily.
those
were
his
fingerprints,
whenever
they
had
been
taken;
i
just
wondered
what
else
happened
during
this
--
at
the
time
his
fingerprints
were
taken,
on
the
12th.
was
he
interrogated?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
later?
justice
potter
stewart
over
at
jackson
where
he
was?
justice
potter
stewart
in
twice,
it
is
the
fingerprint
of
what?
23
or
24
other
young
negro's
were
sent
to
washington
in
connection
with
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
as
the
record
shows.
justice
potter
stewart
had
they
--
had
all
those
23
or
24
have
been
arrested,
does
the
record
show?
justice
potter
stewart
taken
over
jackson
and
given
lie
detector
test?
justice
potter
stewart
not
that?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
they
--
what
if
they
just
had
an
arrest
even
though
--
what
if
they
just
gone
through
a
neighborhood
and
said
we
want
to
take
the
fingerprints
of
all
the
young
negro's
on
this
neighborhood
between
the
ages
of
15
and
20?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
my
fingerprints
were
on
file,
the
fbi
--
justice
potter
stewart
just
because
i
was
in
the
military
service.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
my
question
really
is,
is
that
your
claim
at
all
that
taking
of
his
fingerprints
as
such
violated
any
provision
of
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
its
only
at
the
time
and
place
when
they
were
taken,
he
under
you
say
illegal
arrest?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
that
you're
only
trying
--
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
the
question
mark?
is
that
the
name
of
that
plane?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
miranda
claim
that
--
your
adversary
is
not
relying
one
bit
on
miranda,
miranda
is
fifth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
you
are
going
back
for
a
moment
if
you
will
to
the
first
three
points
you
made
in
summary.
justice
potter
stewart
the
last
of
which
was
--
the
third
of
which
was
that
fingerprints
are
not
excluded
from
the
--
are
not
accepted
from
the
exclusionary
rule.
there's
the
bynum
case
in
the
district
of
columbia.
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
any
other
cases
on
that
point?
justice
