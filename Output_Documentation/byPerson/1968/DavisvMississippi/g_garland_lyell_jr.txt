mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'll
be
as
brief
as
possible
because
i
can
see
most
of
the
cites
of
counsel
is
already
of
no
probable
cause
appearing
in
this
record
for
the
second
arrest
and
i'm
really
not
concerned
with
the
second
arrest
and
i
don't
mean
to
use
that
word
second
arrest
in
the
sense
that
there
was
first.
well,
the
state's
position
is
this
that
there's
a
heinous
crime
unsolved.
the
only
leads
they've
got
is
two
what
fingerprints
and
a
palm
print
in
the
window
sill
and
the
window
pane
on
the
victim's
home.
this
has
got
nothing
to
do
with
merits
of
the
court
might
be
asked
to
know
that
mrs.
key,
is
a
mother
of
al
and
fred
key
who
in
the
turn
deserves
at
the
world
endurance
flight
plain
record
--
plane
flight
record
which
still
stands,
except
the
light
plan
of
(inaudible)
of
37
days.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
believe
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
now,
here
we
have
this
a
crime
and
the
record
is
slim
as
to
what
lead
--
led
the
police
to
pick
this
boy
up,
evidently,
he
won
the
first
but
not
the
first
picked
up
and
interrogated.
now,
i'm
thriving
on
a
proposition,
please
the
court,
generalized
statements
from
the
case
like
culombe
versus
connecticut
which
was
reversed
by
other
reasons
that
this
was
a
general
inquiry
into
another
unsolved
crime
and
often
there
--
this
is
quoted,
“often
there
is
little
else
the
police
can
do
than
interrogate
suspects
as
an
independent
part
of
criminal
investigations.”
and
to
further
quotes
from
the
opinion
and
probably
the
most
restrict
piece
this
quote
of
evidence
now
from
investigations
miranda,
“general
on
the
same
questioning
as
to
facts
surrounding
a
crime,”
in
which
to
emphasis
this
language.
all
other
general
questioning
of
citizens
in
the
fact
finding
process
is
not
affected
by
a
vote.
and
further
that
fingerprints
fall
in
a
different
category
--
testimony
that
is
presents
as
held
in
schmergel
(ph)
versus
california
that
it
even
had
taken
a
bluff
over
objection
was
a
perfect
form
as
long
as
it's
done
in
clinical
conditions
as
was
done
in
this
case.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
it's
the
state's
position
that
in
a
case
of
this
kind
where
you
got
no
positive
identity
and
the
record
is
slim
as
it
says
to
what
leads
the
police
could
get
from
mrs.
key.
i
believe
the
original
as
the
supreme
court
record
is
here
and
you
see
pictures
in
the
record
of
mrs.
key
in
the
hospital
bed
and
like
bruises
about
the
face
and
i
think
on
that.
and
it's
just
my
conjecture
and
her
age
in
having
gone
through
what
she
had.
she
was
not
in
a
position
to
give
them
very
much
information
but
suffice
to
say
as
our
state
supreme
court
went
along
with
my
argument
on
that
this
boy
and
incidentally
was
only
14
at
the
time
of
this
and
i'm
satisfied
because
of
his
youth
that
he
didn't
get
the
death
penalty,
his
youth
and
the
age
of
the
victim.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
my
answer
sir
is
this.
he
was
in
restraint
but
not
under
arrest
in
the
legal
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
--
sense
of
the
word.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
but
miranda
has
only
to
do
with
testimonial
evidence,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
the
distinction
is
set
out
in
schmergel
(ph)
versus
california
and
other
cases
signing
there
is.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
understand
that
but
i'm
getting
back
to
the
fourth
amendment
on
the
arrest
and
it's
our
position
that
it
was
not
illegal
--
an
arrest
in
the
legal
sense
of
the
word,
that
it
was
part
of
a
fact
finding
process.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
mr.
justice
white,
i
wouldn't
say
it
was
voluntary,
i
don't
know,
that
didn't
go
into
that.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
the
14-year
old
boy?
i
wouldn't
say
that.
i
can't
say
but
i
wouldn't
say
this
was
voluntary.
it
wasn't
developed
and
confirmed.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
think
the
record
show
they
interrogated
the
26,
27
and
nobody
remembered
for
sure
and
i
think
they
both
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
the
record
doesn't
show,
apparently
home,
schools,
i
just
don't
have
the
conjecture.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
they
brought
this
one
and
down
26
were
they
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
the
last
one
in
20
somewhat
others
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
and
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
it
doesn't
show.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
at
the
--
again
per
conjecture
on
my
part,
i
know
--
i
know
at
least
there's
no
indication
in
this
record
that
anybody
was
intimidated.
i'm
sure
that's
what
you
getting
at
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
little
it
is
in
the
record
about
the
trip
to
jackson.
i
believe
the
record
shows
that
almost
positive
that
the
boy's
mother
approved
but
i'm
not
--
i'm
trying
to
forget
the
second,
the
third
what
i
say
is
the
first
legal
arrest
and
the
trip
to
jackson
because
even
though
i
was
there
there's
been
some
statement
against
some
old
but
it
was
not
used
in
the
trial,
nothing
as
a
result
of
his
arrest
when
he
was
taken
to
jackson
was
used
at
the
trial.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
think
it
does.
i
think
that's
the
question
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
then
my
way
of
thinking
is
the
question
was
they
arrested
when
he
was
first
interrogated
and
printed
at
police
headquarters.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
there
again
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i'm
saying
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
so,
that
i'll
get
them
sooner,
give
them
prints
that
was
sort
of
a
clerical
error,
and
officers
police
department
over
there
at
meridian
and
its
certainly
under
chapman
versus
california,
the
officer
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'll
be
as
brief
as
possible
because
i
can
see
most
of
the
cites
of
counsel
is
already
of
no
probable
cause
appearing

the

and
i'm
really

the
second
arrest
and
i
don't
mean
to
use
that
word
second
arrest
in
the
sense
that
there
was
first.
well,
the
state's

this
that
there's
a

now,
here
we
have
this
a

and
the

is

to
what

--
led
the

my

is

he

but
not
under

in
the
legal
--
mr.
g.

--
sense
of

mr.

but
miranda
has
only

i
don't
know,
that
didn't
go
into
that.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,

the
14-year
old
boy?
i
wouldn't
say
that.
i
can't
say
but
i
wouldn't

this
was

it
wasn't

mr.

i
think
the

show
they
interrogated
the
26,
27
and
nobody
remembered
for

and
i
think
they
both
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
the
record
doesn't
show,
apparently
home,
schools,
i
just
don't
have
the
conjecture.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
they
brought
this
one
and
down
26
were
they
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
the
last
one
in
20
somewhat
others
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
and
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
it
doesn't
show.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
mr.
justice
marshall,
at
the
--
again
per
conjecture
on
my
part,
i
know
--
i
know
at
least
there's
no
indication
in
this
record
that
anybody
was
intimidated.
i'm
sure
that's
what
you
getting
at
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
what
little
it
is
in
the
record
about
the
trip
to
jackson.
i
believe
the
record
shows
that
almost
positive
that
the
boy's
mother
approved
but
i'm
not
--
i'm
trying
to
forget
the
second,
the
third
what
i
say
is
the
first
legal
arrest
and
the
trip
to

because
even
though
i
was

there's
been
some
statement
against

it
was
not

nothing
as

when
he
was
taken
to
jackson
was
used
at
the
trial.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i
think
it
does.
i
think
that's
the
question
mr.
justice
black.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
then
my
way
of
thinking
is
the
question
was
they
arrested
when
he
was
first
interrogated
and
printed
at
police
headquarters.
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
well,
there
again
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
i'm
saying
--
mr.
g.
garland
lyell,
jr.
so,
that
i'll
get
them
sooner,
give
them
prints
that
was
sort
of
a
clerical
error,
and
officers
police
department
over
there
at

and
its
certainly
under

the
officer
beyond
a
