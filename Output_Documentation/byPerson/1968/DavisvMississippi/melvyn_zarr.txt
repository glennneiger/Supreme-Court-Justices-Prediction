mr.
melvyn
zarr
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
in
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
to
review
petitioner's
criminal
conviction.
petitioner
john
davis,
a
14-year
old
negro
boy
was
convicted
of
raping
an
86-year
old
white
woman
for
whom
he
had
done
yard
work
and
he
as
sentence
to
life
imprisonment.
this
court
granted
the
petitioner's
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
forms
a
purpose
to
consider
whether
the
police
conduct
evidence
by
this
case
contriving
in
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
and
if
so,
whether
the
product
of
that
illegal
police
conduct,
petitioner's
fingerprints
was
properly
admitted
into
evidence
at
petitioner's
trial.
briefly,
the
facts
of
this,
starting
december
3,
1965,
the
police
of
meridian,
mississippi
took
into
custody
for
investigation
some
65
to
70
negro
boys.
now,
what
they
were
investigating
was
a
complaint
of
rape
by
an
86-year
old
white
woman,
who
had
reported
to
the
police
that
she
had
been
attacked
in
her
home
by
a
negro
youth
on
the
evening
of
december
2nd,
apparently
around
seven
o'clock.
the
nature
of
her
description
is
uncertain
but
its
quality
can
be
inferred
from
the
number
of
suspects
that
appeared
to
cover.
two
partial
fingerprints
had
been
found
on
the
outside
of
a
window
and
a
partial
palm
print
that's
been
found
in
the
inside
window
sill.
on
this
basis,
they
drag
had
begun.
the
petitioner,
a
14-year
old
negro
boy,
who
had
done
yard
work
for
the
woman
was
one
of
the
65
to
70
negro
boys
taken
into
custody.
the
petitioner
was
taken
to
the
police
headquarters
on
december
3rd,
questioned,
fingerprinted
and
released.
the
others
apparently
went
to
a
similar
procedure.
now,
it's
quite
clear
from
the
record
that
there
was
no
warrant
for
petitioner's
detention.
why?
the
reason
is
best
capsulized
in
respondent's
brief
at
page
2
in
these
terms,
i'd
like
to
quote
it,
“that
none
of
the
65
or
70
who
are
interrogated
or
picked
up
were
suspects
but
were
only
interrogated
and
printed
by
the
police
in
an
effort
to
get
leads
to
establish
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
guilty
party.”
that
was
on
page
2
of
the
respondent's
brief.
now,
at
that
december
3rd
detention,
which
was
the
petitioner's
first
detention,
he
was
fingerprinted
and
those
sets
i
shall
refer
to
as
the
first
set.
they
were
never
analyzed
nor
introduced
in
evidence
and
nothing
further
has
been
heard
of
them.
now,
between
december
3rd
and
7th,
he
was
taken
into
custody
in
the
words
of
the
police
juvenile
officer
keller
about
four
or
five
times.
officer
keller
testified
that
he
was
picked
up
in
an
attempt
to
get
leads,
those
are
his
words,
and
on
at
least
one
occasion
the
petitioner
was
taken
to
the
hospital
and
exhibited
to
the
prosecutor
for
a
“gage
to
go
by
on
size
and
color.”
however,
there
was
apparently
no
positive
identification
even
though
the
record
is
clear
that
the
petitioner
had
done
some
yard
work
for
her
recently
as
two
weeks
before.
the
last
detention
from
which
the
fingerprints
that
were
introduced
in
the
evidence
is
second
set
was
green
was
on
--
begin
on
december
12th,
again
without
a
warrant.
he
was
driven
to
jackson
having
been
picked
up
by
officer
keller
and
chief
bedingfield,
kept
overnight
to
the
jackson
jail,
given
a
lie
detector
test
the
following
day
and
return
to
the
meridian
jail.
on
december
14th,
this
second
set
was
taken
and
sent
off
to
the
fbi
laboratory
in
washington
together
with
the
prints
of
approximately
23
of
negro
boys
who
were
still
under
suspicion
at
that
time.
on
december
14th,
all
the
record
does
not
show
that
he
was
charged
with
juvenile
delinquency
for
breaking
into
the
woman's
home.
three
days
later,
his
case
was
certified
by
the
juvenile
judge
after
hearing
to
the
circuit
court
of
lauderdale
county,
in
which
court
he
was
indicted
and
tried.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes
sir.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes
sir.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
at
the
trial,
the
testimony
presented
by
the
state,
well,
before
i
get
to
that,
let
me
first
say
that
preliminarily,
petitioner's
counsel
moved
to
suppress
the
introduction
of
evidence
of
a
second
set
of
fingerprints
as
violative
of
his
rights
into
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
after
a
hearing
this
motion
was
denied,
the
prosecution's
case
consisted
of
the
woman's
testimony,
we
just
capsulized
at
page
4
and
5
of
our
brief
to
the
effect
that
that
he
had
done
yard
work
for
her.
a
description
of
the
attack
which
is
contained
and
set
out
in
the
brief,
there
was
no
medical
evidence,
the
second
set
of
fingerprints
came
in
over
objection
and
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
i
have
no
idea
your
honor.
the
testimony
in
the
record
when
that
was
asked
by
ms.
yang
of
the
detective
scarborough,
he
merely
said
that
they
were
very
busy
and
they
were
just
--
they
just
never
got
around
to
setting
the
first
set
out.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
no,
sir.
but
except
for
this.
the
respondent
argues
that
even
assuming
for
purpose
of
the
argument
which
he
is
willing
to
do
that
the
second
detention,
that
is
--
the
last
detention
that
is
december
12
which
he
yields
at
the
second
set,
even
assuming
that
that
detention
was
illegal.
this
court
should
still
hold
the
conviction
because
on
a
retrial,
this
first
set
which
possibly
sitting
in
the
file
supplies
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
oh,
yes
sir.
yes,
sir.
but
my
point
about
both
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
we
contend
that
there
was
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
well,
your
honor,
the
only
testimony
as
to
this
first
detention
which
we
call
an
arrest
that
of
december
3rd
was
by
officer
griffin
on
page
6
and
officer
thompson
on
page
6
and
7.
he
was
asked
question,
“didn't
you
have
occasion
on
december
3rd
last
year
to
arrest
the
defendant
john
davis?”
answer,
“i
did.”
“did
you
tell
the
court
whether
or
not
you
had
a
warrant
for
his
arrest?”
answer,
“i
did
not.”
question,
“you
did
not
have
a
warrant
for
his
arrest?”
almost
the
identical
testimony
was
conducted
by
mr.
yang
and
mr.
thompson,
officer
thompson
and
that
is
the
only,
only
evidence
in
the
record
about
that
december
3rd
arrest.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
they
did
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
they
did
on
the
--
under
december
3rd.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
it's
scattered
throughout
the
record
your
honor.
on
page
8,
the
police
officer
--
chief
bedingfield
testified
here
that
middle
of
the
page
that
he
went
with
the
petitioner
to
jackson
on
the
12th.
on
page
10,
the
--
officer
keller
testifies
near
the
bottom
of
the
page.
question
now,
“when
you
picked
him
up
on
the
12th,
did
you
have
a
warrant
at
that
time
for
his
arrest?”
the
answer,
“no.”
few
answers
previous
to
that
is
a
testimony
of
the
effect
that
they
in
fact
did
pick
him
up
on
the
12th.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
held
that
on
the
12th,
he
was
arrested.
on
page
58
of
the
appendix
about
10
lines
down
the
court
says,
however
on
december
12th,
the
appellant
actually
was
arrested,
brought
to
jackson
and
subjected
to
a
lie
detector
test
and
of
course
that's
supported
by
the
record.
let
me
back
up
for
one
moment
and
discuss
what
the
mississippi
supreme
court
held,
two
things.
one,
that
the
detention
yielding
the
prints
was
not
an
arrest,
this
probably
based
on
the
mistaken
assumption
that
the
prints
had
been
taken
as
a
result
of
the
first
detention,
those
who
were
introduced
in
evidence
were
the
product
of
the
first
detention.
and
secondly,
apparently
alternatively,
the
print
should
not
be
excluded
because
they
are
authentic.
now,
respondent
argues
and
i
better
complete
this
argument
that
the
--
even
though
--
even
assuming
argument
that
the
prints,
the
second
set
of
prints
are
to
be
excludable
as
a
result
of
a
--
an
illegal
arrest.
the
conviction
must
yet
be
affirmed
because
on
and
assured
retrial,
the
first
set
which
is
presumably
lying
around
some
place
hasn't
been
used
could
be
introduced,
and
therefore
to
reverse
this
conviction
would
be
“a
useless
gesture”
quoting
from
the
brief
at
page
8,
to
reverse
this
conviction
only
to
submit
the
first
set
of
prints
to
be
introduced
in
evidence
at
john's
retrial.
this
argument
of
course
assumes
that
the
first
detention
was
legal
and
we
maintain
quite
the
contrary
and
urge
the
court
to
set
at
rest
the
constitutional
sides
of
both
sets
of
prints
in
order
to
forestall
the
necessity
of
further
review
by
this
court.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
well
your
honor,
we
assume
that
traditional
scope
obtained
principles
will
apply
and
it
would
be
free
to
--
a
position
would
free
at
some
subsequent
time
as
a
retrial
to
challenge
a
new
set
of
prints
as
a
product
of
the
original
obtained.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
you
mean
not
in
this
case
your
honor
but
just
some
types
of
set
of
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
well,
would
that
be
under
the
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
well,
i'm
going
to
assume
your
honor
that
they
would
have
to
go
to
his
house,
if
they
were
willing
to
do
this
legally
this
time
with
a
warrant
and
they
would
depend
on
what
--
on
what
that
warrant
was
based
on.
if
it
fact
was
based
upon
her
affidavit,
mrs.
key's
affidavit,
the
prosecutor's
affidavit
and
that
affidavit
was
in
fact
tainted
by
this
prior
set
of
fingerprints,
then
we
would
assume
a
scope
obtained
principle
would
apply
and
that
could
be
excluded
but
it
would
depend
on
what
the
facts
at
a
later
hearing
would
turn
up.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
that's
right
your
honor
and
i
think
that
there
may
be
a
narrow
exception
for
true
voluntary
detention.
i
think
that
it's
possible
that
one
could
conceive
a
situation
which
is
this
is
an
action
voluntarily
to
give
his
prints
in
order
to
eliminate
any
suspicion
of
himself
but
of
course
this
court's
voluntariness
test
would
have
to
apply.
he
have
to
knowingly
and
freely
involuntarily
give
up
his
prints
and
asserting
well
that
they
would
have
to
knowingly,
knowingly
that
he
could
refuse
and
nothing
would
happen,
that
he
have
to
knowingly
give
up
his
prints.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes
she
did
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
sir.
she
was
--
said
she
was
pretty
sure
mr.
melvyn
zarr
it
might
very
well
your
honor
and
then
we
would
be
free
to
argue.
we
contend
that
that
--
the
affidavit
that
led
to
that
warrant
was
tainted.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
by
the
fact
that
he
had
already
been
convicted
and
apparently
her
testimony
was
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
sir.
but
her
testimony
at
the
trial
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
was
influenced
very
much
by
what
the
police
had
done
to
him
including
the
statement
he
confessed
at
all.
i
think
that
her
--
we
would
be
free
to
argue
this
would
be
open
at
retrial
i
think
your
honor
that
that
was
tainted.
i'm
not
sure
the
court
has
to
get
to
into
it
at
this
point,
it
seems
to
be
just
sufficient
to
say
that
petitioner
would
be
able
to
argue
with
some
subsequent
proceeding
that
the
--
a
new
set
however
obtained
was
tainted.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
i
believe
so.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
just
about
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
your
honor,
yes
and
that
is
what
you
put
your
finger
on
when
its
essentially
fishy
about
this
case.
that
is
her
original
identification
was
apparently
so
fussy
that
it
covered
the
65
to
70.
at
the
hospital
prior
of
the
12
and
after
the
3rd,
she
wasn't
able
to
identify
positively
the
petitioner
and
now
a
year
later,
she
is
able
to
say
that
she
is
pretty
sure
that
was
johnny.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
on
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
sir,
now
when
she
says
another
point
that
she's
pretty
sure.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
and
on
page
30
of
the
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
no,
no
she
was
not.
the
only
testimony
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
no,
she
was
not
your
honor.
the
only
testimony
about
the
hospital
--
the
failure
to
identify
positively
at
the
hospital
is
by
a
juvenile
officer
keller
on
page
51.
the
question,
“did
mrs.
key
identify
him?”
answer,
“not
positively.”
question,
“mr.
keller,
did
you
say
that
mrs.
key
did
not
identify
the
defendant
at
the
hospital?”
answer,
“that's
right.”
that's
all
what's
in
the
record
about
that
hospital
identification.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
well,
i
do
too
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
my
point
your
honor
is
this
that
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
i
was
wrong
to
say
they
might
and
my
only
point
was
that
if
there
were
a
new
warrant
that
this
court
needs
to
decide
nothing
about
that
at
this
time.
and
my
only
point
was
that
the
petitioner
would
be
free
to
argue
with
some
future
time
that
a
new
set
was
tainted,
that's
all
my
point
was
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
your
honor,
the
only
testimony
that
i
cited
was
on
page
51
of
the
appendix
where
the
police
juvenile
officer
in
describing
one
of
those
detentions
between
the
3rd
and
the
12th,
he
said
it
was
somewhere
on
the
5th,
6th
to
7th,
referred
to
that
hospital,
short
effect.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
that's
right
sir,
she
was
not.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
now,
we
assert
that
the
both
arrest,
the
first
and
the
last
are
illegal,
but
first,
we
have
to
deal
with
the
decision
by
the
court
below
that
although
the
second
detention
was
an
arrest,
the
first
detention
was
not
and
why?
well,
both
times
that
he
was
taken
into
custody,
obtained
at
the
station
house,
interrogated
and
fingerprinted
but
the
difference
the
court
below
holds
is
at
the
first
time,
the
police
had
no
intention
to
charge
him
with
crime
but
merely
wanted
to
investigate
him.
there
are
two
answers
to
this.
the
first
is
that
there
is
no
testimony
about
police
intention
after
december
3rd.
the
only
testimony
as
to
the
arrest
at
december
3rd
is
that
which
i
quoted
from
earlier
page
6
and
7
of
the
record
by
the
arresting
officers.
but
there's
a
sharper
answer
called
for
in
this
case
and
the
fact
is
this.
that
the
fact
that
the
officer
had
an
investigative
intent
only
in
taking
him
to
the
station
on
december
3rd
does
not
dispense
with
the
constitutional
requirements
of
obtaining
a
warrant
or
under
circumstances
where
a
warrant
maybe
excused
with
showing
of
probable
cause.
to
the
contrary
and
this
is
our
central
point
in
the
case.
to
the
contrary,
the
fact
that
there
was
an
investigative
intention
only
reinforces
the
legality
of
the
detention.
reinforces
the
conclusion
that
there
was
a
violation
of
constitutional
safeguards
because
you
can't
get
a
warrant
at
least
under
the
law
of
the
land
for
an
investigative
arrest
and
you
can't
show
probable
cause
or
you
can't
take
someone
down
at
the
station
in
order
to
get
probable
cause
to
detain
him
further.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
entirely.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
no,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
that's
right.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
that
was
compelled
by
schmergel
(ph)
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
well
your
honor,
let
me
capsulate
like
go
over
it
again
and
see
if
we
can
narrow
it
down.
it
was
the
arrest
at
december
3rd,
the
number
of
pickups
by
keller
between
the
3rd
and
the
12th,
he
said
four
or
five
times
in
an
attempt
to
get
leads.
and
the
final
detention
of
december
12th
from
which
he
has
never
been
released
and
that's
essentially
is
it.
you
want
to
direct
my
attention
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
well,
the
given
--
he
was
taken
90
miles,
given
a
lie
detector
test.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
right.
and
then
brought
back,
kept
some
more
at
in
jail,
finally,
his
prints
were
taken
at
the
14th
and
those
were
sent
off
to
washington
and
those
were
introduced
in
evidence,
that's
what
i
called
the
second
set.
there's
a
reference
in
the
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
on
the
14th,
same
day
that
his
were
taken,
his
second
set
was
taken.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
is
best
one
conferred
from
it.
it's
a
very
skimpy
record
your
honor.
the
best
that
i
can
tell
all
those
same
kind
of
treatment
had
been
meted
out
to
them.
they
have
been
taken
to
the
station
house
and
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
no,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
i
don't
think
that,
no.
therefore
to
return
to
the
tread
of
our
argument,
the
failure
to
obtain
a
warrant
or
to
make
any
attempt
to
show
probable
cause
for
the
two
arrest
is
explainable
by
the
fact
that
this
was
just
for
an
investigate
--
just
for
investigation.
this
was
an
investigative
arrest
but
is
not
excusable.
now,
i
turn
to
the
warrant
point
first.
the
record
is
clear
that
there
was
no
warrant
for
petitioner's
arrest
on
both
on
the
3rd
and
12th.
as
i
indicated,
the
police
can't
get
a
warrant
under
the
law
of
the
land
for
such
an
investigative
detention,
so
that
we
can
understand
why
no
warrant
was
obtained
even
though
we
cannot
excuse
it.
i
see
my
time
is
running
short
so
i'll
skip
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
well,
your
honor.
i
think
that
under
most
circumstances,
they
would
actually
have
to
have
an
arrest
warrant
in
order
to
take
that
thing
except
for
the
category
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
well,
that
i
like
to
stop
in
freeze
bone,
they
escalate
into
a
situation
where
he
then
becomes
under
greater
suspicion
but
i
think
that
i'm
willing
to
concede
that
there
maybe
a
very
narrow
category
of
cases
called
voluntary
giving
of
fingerprint
cases
in
which
the
person
actually
knows
that
nothing
will
happen
if
he
refuses
to
comply
but
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
oh
no,
no,
your
honor.
our
contention
is
grounded
upon
the
fact
that
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
sir.
our
contention
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
is
grounded
upon
the
fact
that
there
was
illegal
police
conduct.
outrageously
illegal
police
conduct
and
the
fact
that
these
fingerprints
were
the
product
of
this
illegal
police
conduct
means
that
--
if
the
exclusionary
rule
means
anything
that
these
fingerprints
should
be
excluded.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
they
would
have
to
have
a
warrant
for
that
kind
of
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
sir,
without
a
warrant.
yes
sir.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
that's
right.
unless
--
unless
mr.
justice
white
and
here's
my
point.
there's
one
of
this
narrow
category
cases
that's
really
voluntary
in
giving
a
fingerprints.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
sure.
let
me
continue
quickly
to
the
point
that
there
was
another
attempt
to
show
probable
cause
for
either
arrest
that
of
december
3rd
or
december
12th.
again,
it
was
impossible
for
the
police
to
do
so.
it's
clear
from
the
record
that
all
they
want
to
do
is
investigate,
so
of
course
there
was
no
probable
cause.
finally,
i
come
to
the
court
below
ruling
that
fingerprints
are
excluded
from
the
operation
in
the
exclusionary
rule
in
fourth
--
in
the
fourth
amendment
and
i
start
with
this
court's
landmark
ruling
in
mapp
v.
ohio
that
all
of
us
obtained
by
searches
and
seizures
are
violation
of
the
constitution
is
inadmissible
in
state
proceedings.
i
do
want
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal
and
so
i
think
i'll
stop
here.
the
argument
on
fingerprints
and
their
subjection
to
the
exclusionary
rule
as
contained
in
our
brief
and
i'll
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
summarize
the
major
points
i
made
yesterday
and
then
say
a
few
things
about
the
record.
the
major
points
were
these;
one,
that
the
petitioner
was
caught
up
in
a
police
dragnet.
two,
that
the
two
detentions
of
petitioner
yielding
the
two
sets
of
fingerprints
were
illegal
arrest
because
in
the
first
place,
in
neither
case
was
there
was
a
warrant
to
earn
any
attempt
to
show
exigent
circumstances
excusing
a
warrant.
and
secondly,
even
assuming
that
the
warrant
requirement
could
somehow
be
excused
in
this
case,
there
was
no
attempt
by
the
state
to
show
probable
cause
to
arrest.
next
the
fact
that
these
arrests
were
for
investigation
only
explains
but
cannot
excuse
the
failure
to
comply
with
these
constitutional
safeguards,
and
last
that
fingerprints
are
not
accepted
from
the
operation
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
now,
counsel
opposite
stressed
to
the
court
yesterday
that
the
december
3rd
detention,
the
first
detention
was
not
an
arrest
and
apparently
relied
upon
the
court’s
below
ruling
which
in
role
and
part
appears
at
page
59
of
the
record
which
i
shall
just
briefly
read.
the
court
below
said
this,
the
officer
said
that
he
arrested
appellant
but
the
evidence
which
is
in
no
way
controverted
shows
that
appellant
was
merely
escorted
to
headquarters
for
interrogation
as
in
fact
for
numerous
others
in
the
course
of
an
investigation
by
police
of
an
unsolved
major
crime.
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
there
was
no
intention
to
arrest
within
the
accepted
legal
meaning
of
the
word
and
of
course
there
are
two
answers
to
this.
one,
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
that
statement
is
wrong
that
the
only
testimony
in
the
record
about
december
3rd
arrest
is
that
of
officer
griffin
and
thompson
which
they
say
they
arrested
the
petitioner
and
there
is
nothing
to
controvert
that.
and
the
second
answer
of
course
is
that
this
was
an
investigative
arrest
and
that
as
we
have
argued
is
illegal.
i
have
two
evidentiary
points,
one,
i
want
to
stress
that
the
petitioner
had
done
the
yard
work
for
the
woman
at
page
17
interrogation
there
that
the
record
makes
that
clear.
and
next,
i
want
to
stress
that
even
though
mr.
justice
stewart
yesterday
correctly
observed
that
she
testified
that
there
was
no
doubt
in
my
mind
about
it
that
johnny
was
the
one.
in
other
places,
she
was
not
quite
so
positive
at
page
22
just
previous
to
that
she
says,
“i
recognized
it
was
johnny.
i
thought
it
was
but
i
wasn’t
perfectly
sure
right
then
but
then
i
knew
nobody
else
have
been
in
the
house
but
him.
i
asked
him
to
carry
a
table
to
the
kitchen
where
he
threw
the
light
where
the
media
was.”
and
on
page
30
of
the
record,
on
cross-examination,
she
says
in
response
to
the
question,
“but
by
light
of
the
flashlight
could
you
see
his
face?”
answer,
“yes
sir,
true.
he
had
that
fascinator
put
to
the
head
piece
over
it
and
i
could
see
through
that
crochet
part
his
face
and
i
recognized
him
or
who’s
as
far
that's
who
it
was.
i
was
pretty
sure
it
was.”
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
none
that
we
could
find
your
honor
that
dealt
explicitly
with
fingerprints.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
thank
you
(voice
overlap).
mr.
melvyn
zarr
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
in
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
to
review
petitioner's
criminal
conviction.
petitioner
john
davis,
a
14-year
old
negro
boy
was
convicted
of
raping
an
86-year
old
white
woman
for
whom
he
had
done
yard
work
and
he
as
sentence
to
life
imprisonment.
this
court
granted
the
petitioner's
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
forms
a
purpose
to
consider
whether
the
police
conduct
evidence
by
this
case
contriving
in
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
and
if
so,
whether
the
product
of
that
illegal
police
conduct,
petitioner's
fingerprints
was
properly
admitted
into
evidence
at
petitioner's
trial.
briefly,
the
facts
of
this,
starting
december
3,
1965,
the
police
of
meridian,
mississippi
took
into
custody
for
investigation
some
65
to
70
negro
boys.
now,
what
they
were
investigating
was
a
complaint
of
rape
by
an
86-year
old
white
woman,
who
had
reported
to
the
police
that
she
had
been
attacked
in
her
home
by
a
negro
youth
on
the
evening
of
december
2nd,
apparently
around
seven
o'clock.
the
nature
of
her
description
is
uncertain
but
its
quality
can
be
inferred
from
the
number
of
suspects
that
appeared
to
cover.
two
partial
fingerprints
had
been
found
on
the
outside
of
a
window
and
a
partial
palm
print
that's
been
found
in
the
inside
window
sill.
on
this
basis,
they
drag
had
begun.
the
petitioner,
a
14-year
old
negro
boy,
who
had
done
yard
work
for
the
woman
was
one
of
the
65
to
70
negro
boys
taken
into
custody.
the
petitioner
was
taken
to
the
police
headquarters
on
december
3rd,
questioned,
fingerprinted
and
released.
the
others
apparently
went
to
a
similar
procedure.
now,
it's
quite
clear
from
the
record
that
there
was
no
warrant
for
petitioner's
detention.
why?
the
reason
is
best
capsulized
in
respondent's
brief
at
page
2
in
these
terms,
i'd
like
to
quote
it,
“that
none
of
the
65
or
70
who
are
interrogated
or
picked
up
were
suspects
but
were
only
interrogated
and
printed
by
the
police
in
an
effort
to
get
leads
to
establish
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
guilty
party.”
that
was
on
page
2
of
the
respondent's
brief.
now,
at
that
december
3rd
detention,
which
was
the
petitioner's
first
detention,
he
was
fingerprinted
and
those
sets
i
shall
refer
to
as
the
first
set.
they
were
never
analyzed
nor
introduced
in
evidence
and
nothing
further
has
been
heard
of
them.
now,
between
december
3rd
and
7th,
he
was
taken
into
custody
in
the
words
of
the
police
juvenile
officer
keller
about
four
or
five
times.
officer
keller
testified
that
he
was
picked
up
in
an
attempt
to
get
leads,
those
are
his
words,
and
on
at
least
one
occasion
the
petitioner
was
taken
to
the
hospital
and
exhibited
to
the
prosecutor
for
a
“gage
to
go
by
on
size
and
color.”
however,
there
was
apparently
no
positive
identification
even
though
the
record
is
clear
that
the
petitioner
had
done
some
yard
work
for
her
recently
as
two
weeks
before.
the
last
detention
from
which
the
fingerprints
that
were
introduced
in
the
evidence
is
second
set
was
green
was
on
--
begin
on
december
12th,
again
without
a
warrant.
he
was
driven
to
jackson
having
been
picked
up
by
officer
keller
and
chief
bedingfield,
kept
overnight
to
the
jackson
jail,
given
a
lie
detector
test
the
following
day
and
return
to
the
meridian
jail.
on
december
14th,
this
second
set
was
taken
and
sent
off
to
the
fbi
laboratory
in
washington
together
with
the
prints
of
approximately
23
of
negro
boys
who
were
still
under
suspicion
at
that
time.
on
december
14th,
all
the
record
does
not
show
that
he
was
charged
with
juvenile
delinquency
for
breaking
into
the
woman's
home.
three
days
later,
his
case
was
certified
by
the
juvenile
judge
after
hearing
to
the
circuit
court
of
lauderdale
county,
in
which
court
he
was
indicted
and
tried.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes
sir.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes
sir.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
at
the
trial,
the
testimony
presented
by
the
state,
well,
before
i
get
to
that,
let
me
first
say
that
preliminarily,
petitioner's
counsel
moved
to
suppress
the
introduction
of
evidence
of
a
second
set
of
fingerprints
as
violative
of
his
rights
into
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
after
a
hearing
this
motion
was
denied,
the
prosecution's
case
consisted
of
the
woman's
testimony,
we
just
capsulized
at
page
4
and
5
of
our
brief
to
the
effect
that
that
he
had
done
yard
work
for
her.
a
description
of
the
attack
which
is
contained
and
set
out
in
the
brief,
there
was
no
medical
evidence,
the
second
set
of
fingerprints
came
in
over
objection
and
he
was
convicted
and
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
i
have
no
idea
your
honor.
the
testimony
in
the
record
when
that
was
asked
by
ms.
yang
of
the
detective
scarborough,
he
merely
said
that
they
were
very
busy
and
they
were
just
--
they
just
never
got
around
to
setting
the
first
set
out.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
no,
sir.
but
except
for
this.
the
respondent
argues
that
even
assuming
for
purpose
of
the
argument
which
he
is
willing
to
do
that
the
second
detention,
that
is
--
the
last
detention
that
is
december
12
which
he
yields
at
the
second
set,
even
assuming
that
that
detention
was
illegal.
this
court
should
still
hold
the
conviction
because
on
a
retrial,
this
first
set
which
possibly
sitting
in
the
file
supplies
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
oh,
yes
sir.
yes,
sir.
but
my
point
about
both
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
we
contend
that
there
was
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
well,
your
honor,
the
only
testimony
as
to
this
first
detention
which
we
call
an
arrest
that
of
december
3rd
was
by
officer
griffin
on
page
6
and
officer
thompson
on
page
6
and
7.
he
was
asked
question,
“didn't
you
have
occasion
on
december
3rd
last
year
to
arrest
the
defendant
john
davis?”
answer,
“i
did.”
“did
you
tell
the
court
whether
or
not
you
had
a
warrant
for
his
arrest?”
answer,
“i
did
not.”
question,
“you
did
not
have
a
warrant
for
his
arrest?”
almost
the
identical
testimony
was
conducted
by
mr.
yang
and
mr.
thompson,
officer
thompson
and
that
is
the
only,
only
evidence
in
the
record
about
that
december
3rd
arrest.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
they
did
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
they
did
on
the
--
under
december
3rd.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
it's
scattered
throughout
the
record
your
honor.
on
page
8,
the
police
officer
--
chief
bedingfield
testified
here
that
middle
of
the
page
that
he
went
with
the
petitioner
to
jackson
on
the
12th.
on
page
10,

officer
keller

question
now,
“when
you
picked
him
up
on
the
12th,
did
you
have
a
warrant
at
that
time
for
his
arrest?”
the
answer,
“no.”
few
answers
previous
to
that
is
a
testimony
of
the
effect
that
they
in
fact
did
pick
him
up
on
the
12th.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
held
that
on
the
12th,
he
was
arrested.
on
page
58
of
the
appendix
about
10
lines
down
the
court
says,
however
on
december
12th,
the
appellant
actually
was
arrested,
brought
to
jackson
and
subjected
to
a
lie
detector
test
and
of
course
that's
supported
by
the
record.
let
me
back
up
for
one
moment
and
discuss
what
the
mississippi
supreme
court
held,
two
things.
one,
that
the
detention
yielding
the
prints
was
not
an
arrest,
this
probably
based
on
the
mistaken
assumption
that
the
prints
had
been
taken
as
a
result
of
the
first
detention,
those
who
were
introduced
in
evidence
were
the
product
of
the
first
detention.
and
secondly,
apparently
alternatively,
the
print
should
not
be
excluded
because
they
are
authentic.
now,
respondent
argues
and
i
better
complete
this
argument
that
the
--
even
though
--
even
assuming
argument
that
the
prints,
the
second
set
of
prints
are
to
be
excludable
as
a
result
of
a
--
an
illegal
arrest.
the
conviction
must
yet
be
affirmed
because
on
and
assured
retrial,
the
first
set
which
is
presumably
lying
around
some
place
hasn't
been
used
could
be
introduced,
and
therefore
to
reverse
this
conviction
would
be
“a
useless
gesture”
quoting
from
the
brief
at
page
8,
to
reverse
this
conviction
only
to
submit
the
first
set
of
prints
to
be
introduced
in
evidence
at
john's
retrial.
this
argument
of
course
assumes
that
the
first
detention
was
legal
and
we
maintain
quite
the
contrary
and
urge
the
court
to
set
at
rest
the
constitutional
sides
of
both
sets
of
prints
in
order
to
forestall
the
necessity
of
further
review
by
this
court.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
well
your
honor,
we
assume
that
traditional
scope
obtained
principles
will
apply
and
it
would
be
free
to
--
a
position
would
free
at
some
subsequent
time
as
a
retrial
to
challenge
a
new
set
of
prints
as
a
product
of
the
original
obtained.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
you
mean
not
in
this
case
your
honor
but
just
some
types
of
set
of
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
well,
would
that
be
under
the
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
well,
i'm
going
to
assume
your
honor
that
they
would
have
to
go
to
his
house,
if
they
were
willing
to
do
this
legally
this
time
with
a
warrant
and
they
would
depend
on
what
--
on
what
that
warrant
was
based
on.
if
it
fact
was
based
upon
her
affidavit,
mrs.
key's
affidavit,
the
prosecutor's
affidavit
and
that
affidavit
was
in
fact
tainted
by
this
prior
set
of
fingerprints,
then
we
would
assume
a
scope
obtained
principle
would
apply
and
that
could
be
excluded
but
it
would
depend
on
what
the
facts
at
a
later
hearing
would
turn
up.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
that's
right
your
honor
and
i
think
that
there
may
be
a
narrow
exception
for
true
voluntary
detention.
i
think
that
it's
possible
that
one
could
conceive
a
situation
which
is
this
is
an
action
voluntarily
to
give
his
prints
in
order
to
eliminate
any
suspicion
of
himself
but
of
course
this
court's
voluntariness
test
would
have
to
apply.
he
have
to
knowingly
and
freely
involuntarily
give
up
his
prints
and
asserting
well
that
they
would
have
to
knowingly,
knowingly
that
he
could
refuse
and
nothing
would
happen,
that
he
have
to
knowingly
give
up
his
prints.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes
she
did
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
sir.
she
was
--
said
she
was
pretty
sure
mr.
melvyn
zarr
it
might
very
well
your
honor
and
then
we
would
be
free
to
argue.
we
contend
that
that
--
the
affidavit
that
led
to
that
warrant
was
tainted.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
by
the
fact
that
he
had
already
been
convicted
and
apparently
her
testimony
was
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
sir.
but
her
testimony
at
the
trial
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
was
influenced
very
much
by
what
the
police
had
done
to
him
including
the
statement
he
confessed
at
all.
i
think
that
her
--
we
would
be
free
to
argue
this
would
be
open
at
retrial
i
think
your
honor
that
that
was
tainted.
i'm
not
sure
the
court
has
to
get
to
into
it
at
this
point,
it
seems
to
be
just
sufficient
to
say
that
petitioner
would
be
able
to
argue
with
some
subsequent
proceeding
that
the
--
a
new
set
however
obtained
was
tainted.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
i
believe
so.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
just
about
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
your
honor,
yes
and
that
is
what
you
put
your
finger
on
when
its
essentially
fishy
about
this
case.
that
is
her
original
identification
was
apparently
so
fussy
that
it
covered
the
65
to
70.
at
the
hospital
prior
of
the
12
and
after
the
3rd,
she
wasn't
able
to
identify
positively
the
petitioner
and
now
a
year
later,
she
is
able
to
say
that
she
is
pretty
sure
that
was
johnny.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
on
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
sir,
now
when
she
says
another
point
that
she's
pretty
sure.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
and
on
page
30
of
the
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
no,
no
she
was
not.
the
only
testimony
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
no,
she
was
not
your
honor.
the
only
testimony
about
the
hospital
--
the
failure
to
identify
positively
at
the
hospital
is
by
a
juvenile
officer
keller
on
page
51.
the
question,
“did
mrs.
key
identify
him?”
answer,
“not
positively.”
question,
“mr.
keller,
did
you
say
that
mrs.
key
did
not
identify
the
defendant
at
the
hospital?”
answer,
“that's
right.”
that's
all
what's
in
the
record
about
that
hospital
identification.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
well,
i
do
too
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
my
point
your
honor
is
this
that
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
i
was
wrong
to
say
they
might
and
my
only
point
was
that
if
there
were
a
new
warrant
that
this
court
needs
to
decide
nothing
about
that
at
this
time.
and
my
only
point
was
that
the
petitioner
would
be
free
to
argue
with
some
future
time
that
a
new
set
was
tainted,
that's
all
my
point
was
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
your
honor,
the
only
testimony
that
i
cited
was
on
page
51
of
the
appendix
where
the
police
juvenile
officer
in
describing
one
of
those
detentions
between
the
3rd
and
the
12th,
he
said
it
was
somewhere
on
the
5th,
6th
to
7th,
referred
to
that
hospital,
short
effect.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
that's
right
sir,
she
was
not.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
now,
we
assert
that
the
both
arrest,
the
first
and
the
last
are
illegal,
but
first,
we
have
to
deal
with
the
decision
by
the
court
below
that
although
the
second
detention
was
an
arrest,
the
first
detention
was
not
and
why?
well,
both
times
that
he
was
taken
into
custody,
obtained
at
the
station
house,
interrogated
and
fingerprinted
but
the
difference
the
court
below
holds
is
at
the
first
time,
the
police
had
no
intention
to
charge
him
with
crime
but
merely
wanted
to
investigate
him.
there
are
two
answers
to
this.
the
first
is
that
there
is
no
testimony
about
police
intention
after
december
3rd.
the
only
testimony
as
to
the
arrest
at
december
3rd
is
that
which
i
quoted
from
earlier
page
6
and
7
of
the
record
by
the
arresting
officers.
but
there's
a
sharper
answer
called
for
in
this
case
and
the
fact
is
this.
that
the
fact
that
the
officer
had
an
investigative
intent
only
in
taking
him
to
the
station
on
december
3rd
does
not
dispense
with
the
constitutional
requirements
of
obtaining
a
warrant
or
under
circumstances
where
a
warrant
maybe
excused
with
showing
of
probable
cause.
to
the
contrary
and
this
is
our
central
point
in
the
case.
to
the
contrary,
the
fact
that
there
was
an
investigative
intention
only
reinforces
the
legality
of
the
detention.
reinforces
the
conclusion
that
there
was
a
violation
of
constitutional
safeguards
because
you
can't
get
a
warrant
at
least
under
the
law
of
the
land
for
an
investigative
arrest
and
you
can't
show
probable
cause
or
you
can't
take
someone
down
at
the
station
in
order
to
get
probable
cause
to
detain
him
further.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
entirely.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
no,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
that's
right.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
that
was
compelled
by
schmergel
(ph)
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
well
your
honor,
let
me
capsulate
like
go
over
it
again
and
see
if
we
can
narrow
it
down.
it
was
the
arrest
at
december
3rd,
the
number
of
pickups
by
keller
between
the
3rd
and
the
12th,
he
said
four
or
five
times
in
an
attempt
to
get
leads.
and
the
final
detention
of
december
12th
from
which
he
has
never
been
released
and
that's
essentially
is
it.
you
want
to
direct
my
attention
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
well,
the
given
--
he
was
taken
90
miles,
given
a
lie
detector
test.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
right.
and
then
brought
back,
kept
some
more
at
in
jail,
finally,
his
prints
were
taken
at
the
14th
and
those
were
sent
off
to
washington
and
those
were
introduced
in
evidence,
that's
what
i
called
the
second
set.
there's
a
reference
in
the
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
on
the
14th,
same
day
that
his
were
taken,
his
second
set
was
taken.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
is
best
one
conferred
from
it.
it's
a
very
skimpy
record
your
honor.
the
best
that
i
can
tell
all
those
same
kind
of
treatment
had
been
meted
out
to
them.
they
have
been
taken
to
the
station
house
and
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
no,
i
don't
think
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
i
don't
think
that,
no.
therefore
to
return
to
the
tread
of
our
argument,
the
failure
to
obtain
a
warrant
or
to
make
any
attempt
to
show
probable
cause
for
the
two
arrest
is
explainable
by
the
fact
that
this
was
just
for
an
investigate
--
just
for
investigation.
this
was
an
investigative
arrest
but
is
not
excusable.
now,
i
turn
to
the
warrant
point
first.
the
record
is
clear
that
there
was
no
warrant
for
petitioner's
arrest
on
both
on
the
3rd
and
12th.
as
i
indicated,
the
police
can't
get
a
warrant
under
the
law
of
the
land
for
such
an
investigative
detention,
so
that
we
can
understand
why
no
warrant
was
obtained
even
though
we
cannot
excuse
it.
i
see
my
time
is
running
short
so
i'll
skip
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
well,
your
honor.
i
think
that
under
most
circumstances,
they
would
actually
have
to
have
an
arrest
warrant
in
order
to
take
that
thing
except
for
the
category
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
well,
that
i
like
to
stop
in
freeze
bone,
they
escalate
into
a
situation
where
he
then
becomes
under
greater
suspicion
but
i
think
that
i'm
willing
to
concede
that
there
maybe
a
very
narrow
category
of
cases
called
voluntary
giving
of
fingerprint
cases
in
which
the
person
actually
knows
that
nothing
will
happen
if
he
refuses
to
comply
but
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
oh
no,
no,
your
honor.
our
contention
is
grounded
upon
the
fact
that
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
sir.
our
contention
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
is
grounded
upon
the
fact
that
there
was
illegal
police
conduct.
outrageously
illegal
police
conduct
and
the
fact
that
these
fingerprints
were
the
product
of
this
illegal
police
conduct
means
that
--
if
the
exclusionary
rule
means
anything
that
these
fingerprints
should
be
excluded.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
they
would
have
to
have
a
warrant
for
that
kind
of
--
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
sir,
without
a
warrant.
yes
sir.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
that's
right.
unless
--
unless
mr.
justice
white
and
here's
my
point.
there's
one
of
this
narrow
category
cases
that's
really
voluntary
in
giving
a
fingerprints.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
sure.
let
me
continue
quickly
to
the
point
that
there
was
another
attempt
to
show
probable
cause
for
either
arrest
that
of
december
3rd
or
december
12th.
again,
it
was
impossible
for
the
police
to
do
so.
it's
clear
from
the
record
that
all
they
want
to
do
is
investigate,
so
of
course
there
was
no
probable
cause.
finally,
i
come
to
the
court
below
ruling
that
fingerprints
are
excluded
from
the
operation
in
the
exclusionary
rule
in
fourth
--
in
the
fourth
amendment
and
i
start
with
this
court's
landmark
ruling
in
mapp
v.
ohio
that
all
of
us
obtained
by
searches
and
seizures
are
violation
of
the
constitution
is
inadmissible
in
state
proceedings.
i
do
want
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal
and
so
i
think
i'll
stop
here.
the
argument
on
fingerprints
and
their
subjection
to
the
exclusionary
rule
as
contained
in
our
brief
and
i'll
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
summarize
the
major
points
i
made
yesterday
and
then
say
a
few
things
about
the
record.
the
major
points
were
these;
one,
that
the
petitioner
was
caught
up
in
a
police
dragnet.
two,
that
the
two
detentions
of
petitioner
yielding
the
two
sets
of
fingerprints
were
illegal
arrest
because
in
the
first
place,
in
neither
case
was
there
was
a
warrant
to
earn
any
attempt
to
show
exigent
circumstances
excusing
a
warrant.
and
secondly,
even
assuming
that
the
warrant
requirement
could
somehow
be
excused
in
this
case,
there
was
no
attempt
by
the
state
to
show
probable
cause
to
arrest.
next
the
fact
that
these
arrests
were
for
investigation
only
explains
but
cannot
excuse
the
failure
to
comply
with
these
constitutional
safeguards,
and
last
that
fingerprints
are
not
accepted
from
the
operation
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
now,
counsel
opposite
stressed
to
the
court
yesterday
that
the
december
3rd
detention,
the
first
detention
was
not
an
arrest
and
apparently
relied
upon
the
court’s
below
ruling
which
in
role
and
part
appears
at
page
59
of
the
record
which
i
shall
just
briefly
read.
the
court
below
said
this,
the
officer
said
that
he
arrested
appellant
but
the
evidence
which
is
in
no
way
controverted
shows
that
appellant
was
merely
escorted
to
headquarters
for
interrogation
as
in
fact
for
numerous
others
in
the
course
of
an
investigation
by
police
of
an
unsolved
major
crime.
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
there
was
no
intention
to
arrest
within
the
accepted
legal
meaning
of
the
word
and
of
course
there
are
two
answers
to
this.
one,
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
that
statement
is
wrong
that
the
only
testimony
in
the
record
about
december
3rd
arrest
is
that
of
officer
griffin
and
thompson
which
they
say
they
arrested
the
petitioner
and
there
is
nothing
to
controvert
that.
and
the
second
answer
of
course
is
that
this
was
an
investigative
arrest
and
that
as
we
have
argued
is
illegal.
i
have
two
evidentiary
points,
one,
i
want
to
stress
that
the
petitioner
had
done
the
yard
work
for
the
woman
at
page
17
interrogation
there
that
the
record
makes
that
clear.
and
next,
i
want
to
stress
that
even
though
mr.
justice
stewart
yesterday
correctly
observed
that
she
testified
that
there
was
no
doubt
in
my
mind
about
it
that
johnny
was
the
one.
in
other
places,
she
was
not
quite
so
positive
at
page
22
just
previous
to
that
she
says,
“i
recognized
it
was
johnny.
i
thought
it
was
but
i
wasn’t
perfectly
sure
right
then
but
then
i
knew
nobody
else
have
been
in
the
house
but
him.
i
asked
him
to
carry
a
table
to
the
kitchen
where
he
threw
the
light
where
the
media
was.”
and
on
page
30
of
the
record,
on
cross-examination,
she
says
in
response
to
the
question,
“but
by
light
of
the
flashlight
could
you
see
his
face?”
answer,
“yes
sir,
true.
he
had
that
fascinator
put
to
the
head
piece
over
it
and
i
could
see
through
that
crochet
part
his
face
and
i
recognized
him
or
who’s
as
far
that's
who
it
was.
i
was
pretty
sure
it
was.”
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
yes,
sir.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
none
that
we
could
find
your
honor
that
dealt
explicitly
with
fingerprints.
mr.
melvyn
zarr
thank
you
(voice
