justice
byron
r.
white
does
north
carolina
effectuate
the
statute
which
requires
credit?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
doesn't
--
he
just
doesn't
say,
i'm
going
to
give
you
15
years
without
regard
to
the
credit
then
leave
it
up
to
the
prison
authorities
to
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
done
both
ways?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
want
to
give
you
15
years
and
the
prison
authorities
will
credit
you
in
the
time,
all
that
he
served.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
here,
he
did
it
the
other
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
it
clear
that
he
did
it
the
other
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
prison
authorities
would
not
give
him
credit
for
any
more
time
on
his
eight-year
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
judge
has
already
given
him
all
the
credit
he
deserves?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
will
be
in
no
position
to
claim
any
more
credit
from
the
prison
authorities
on
account
of
the
sentence
that
he'd
already
served?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
that
seems
to
be
the
basis
on
which
this
case
comes
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if
he
were
still
entitled
to
credit
on
the
eight-year
sentence
for
all
the
time
that
he
had
served
before,
there
wouldn't
be
much
left,
would
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
a
case
that
say
it
isn't
though.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
said
this
and
when?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
your
basic
point
to
this
a
due
process
point,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
--
is
that
the
most
you
can
say
forum
of
their
fundamental
concepts?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
--
what
constitutional
ground
do
you
rely
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
he
have
any
constitutional
right
to
appeal?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
isn't
this
so
--
why
can't
you
approach
it
as
just
a
burden
on
the
other
constitutional
rights
that
he
would
be
urging
on
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
necessarily
a
due
process
approach,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
went
on
--
they
went
on
three
grounds.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
want
to
know
which
one
you're
going
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
this
isn't
this
case.
some
other
cases
in
this
case.
we're
talking
about
this
case.

and
here,
he
did

justice
byron

white
and
is
it
clear
that
he
did
it
the

justice
byron

white
so
the
prison
authorities
would
not
give
him
credit
for

white
do
you
think
the

at

because
if
