mr.
larry
b.
sitton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
larry
sitton.
i'm
from
greensboro,
north
carolina.
and
i
represent
the
respondent
in
this
case,
clifton
a.
pearce.
at
the
outset,
i
might
say
that
--
i
think
mr.
vanore
has
made
it
clear
that
in
this
particular
case
at
the
second
trial
the
judge
gave
mr.
pearce
credit
for
the
time
he
had
served
under
this
first
sentence
and
deducted
that
amount
to
fix
the
eight-year
sentence
and
that
this
credit
would
not
have
been
made
on
the
second
year
sentence.
he
still
had
eight
years
to
serve
and
in
my
brief
that's
the
reason
i
said
it
out
as
i
did.
in
north
carolina
the
computation
of
good
conduct
time,
governor's
time
and
gain
time
becomes
very
complex
but
if
you
measure
the
person's
sentence
as
if
he
served
it
straight
through.
in
other
words,
his
minimum
sentence
on
his
first
conviction
was
12
years
and
this
was
in
1961.
if
he
had
served
it
straight
through,
he
would've
been
released
in
1973.
the
second
sentence
was
for
eight
years
and
this
was
in
1966.
he
served
it
straight
through
he
would've
been
release
in
1974
and
that's
the
basis
of
our
argument
that
it
was
harsher.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
correct
your
honor.
if
you'd
stated
it
that
way,
i
don't
think
there'd
be
ay
question.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
correct.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
right.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
the
way
we
have
both
interpret
it.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
there's
also
the
factor
that
it's
harsher
in
terms
of
parole.
in
north
carolina,
they
construe
the
decision
as
meaning
now,
unless
the
judge
gives
--
makes
an
actual
reference
to
credit
for
parole
purposes
the
person
has
to
serve
the
minimum
period
again.
so
that
at
the
time
pearce
was
tried
again,
he
was
eligible
for
parole.
after
a
second
sentence
he
was
not
eligible
for
another
two
years.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
no,
sir,
your
honor,
because
his
first
sentence
was
12
to
15
years.
he
would've
had
to
do
that
on
a
12-year
basis.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
right.
there
would
be
no
problem
except
for
parole
purposes.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
but
he
makes
--
but
he
cast
his
in
terms
of
a
straight
15
years
sentence.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
correct.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
correct.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
right,
that
it
is
real
--
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
right.
in
this
--
and
in
this
case,
the
decision
of
the
district
court
was
affirmed
by
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
the
basis
of
patton
versus
north
carolina.
and
that
case,
thoroughly
explored
the
constitutional
issues
involved
and
whether
you
can
have
an
increased
sentence
and
said
that
an
increased
sentence
on
retrial
violated
three
portions
of
the
constitution,
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
clauses
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
now,
in
due
process,
the
state
should
not
be
allowed
or
require
the
defendant
to
waive
a
benefit
conferred
by
the
state
in
order
to
assert
his
constitutional
rights.
now,
the
benefit
is
immunity
from
an
increased
sentence
as
already
been
pointed
out
after
the
term
of
court
has
expired
and
the
sentence
has
began
to
be
served,
it
cannot
be
increased
in
north
carolina.
yet,
the
only
way
that
this
is
possible
is
for
a
person
to
assert
his
right
to
a
fair
trial
through
some
method
of
post-conviction
review.
and
if
he
does
this,
if
he
asserts
his
right
to
a
fair
trial
saying
that
there
is
a
constitutional
defect
in
this
first
trial
then
he
runs
the
risk
of
getting
an
increased
sentence.
if
he
had
not
sought
a
fair
trial,
he
would've
been
assured
that
the
time
he
had
served
would
be
credited
and
that
he
would
become
eligible
for
parole
in
due
course.
but
he
didn't
do
this
in
this
case.
he
said
that
there
was
a
constitutional
defect
in
his
first
trial
and
this
was
borne
out
by
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that
would
be
one
way
to
get
around
this
problem
your
honor,
that's
true.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
i
think
so
and
in
north
carolina
because
they
do
have
this
credit
rule,
it
would
be
a
way
to
get
around
it
but
this
again
is
--
this
goes
into
the
function
of
the
sentencing
judge.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
yes,
sir,
i
think
it
would.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
well,
i
think
that
the
--
if
there
was
a
problem
of
prejudice
in
bringing
out
the
first
conviction
i
think
that
rule
could
be
in
such
a
situation
that
the
jury
would
be
allowed
to
set
the
sentence
and
then
it
would
be
reduced
to
bring
it
in
line
with
this
rule.
that
was
the
problem.
i
think
if
the
jury
--
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
whether
the
jury
sentences
or
the
judge
sentence.
the
risk
is
still
the
same
for
the
defendant
in
asserting
his
constitutional
right.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
well,
if
he
was
reconvicted
though,
if
he
was
not
acquitted,
then
he
would
still
under
--
even
under
this
rule
he
would
still
go
back
to
prison
or
could
conceivably
go
back
to
prison
to
serve
out
what
he
would've
had
under
this
original
sentence.
he
just
--
not
walk
out
because
of
this
rule.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
i
don't
think
the
rule
should
be
any
different,
your
honor.
the
simple
reason
that
that
if
it's
possible
under
any
circumstance
to
increase
the
sentence
because
of
additional
evidence
or
because
of
information
in
the
pre-sentence
report,
then
the
danger
still
remains
that
the
person
will
be
penalized
for
asserting
his
constitutional
right.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
it's
a
penalty
though
if
he
has
to
serve
an
increased
sentence.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
but
if
you
have
a
different
rule,
your
honor,
then
you
restrict
his
right
of
appeal.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
but
we
--
but
we
submit
your
honor
that
it
shouldn't
be
that
way.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
yes,
i
think
you
should
because
i
think
this
is
a
violation
of
the
person's
due
process,
his
right
to
due
process.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
i
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
and
that
if
a
state
has
established
a
right
to
appeal
or
a
method
of
post-conviction
review
then
it
--
once
they've
established
it,
it
should
not
be
restricted.
it
should
be
open
to
everyone.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
correct,
your
honor.
on
the
equal
protection
argument,
you
come
back
to
the
same
point
again
that
the
person's
sentence
can't
be
increased
after
he
began
serving.
so
that
the
only
class
of
persons
exposed
to
the
risk
of
increased
sentence
are
those
who
exercise
their
right
of
appeal.
we
submit
that
this
is
an
arbitrary
classification.
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
only
the
class
of
persons
who
have
won
a
new
trial
should
receive
any
harsher
sentence.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
no
sir
and
under
(inaudible)
--
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
yeah,
he's
already
spent
two
years
of
his
life
in
prison.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
no
sir.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
the
rule
of
credit.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
no,
this
is
--
this
rule
is
of
recent
origin
and
i
don't
think
they
--
i
think
they
did
not
make
it
on
the
basis
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
this
is
fair.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
think
even
if
the
state
didn't
have
the
rule
as
north
carolina
does
that
it
would
still
be
unconstitutional
and
impermissible.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
this
case,
i
don't
think
i
would
go
that
far.
it's
not
in
this
case,
of
course,
your
honor.
but
i
don't
think
the
restraint
placed
on
a
person
while
he
is
on
bail
is
the
restraint
that
is
placed
on
him
while
he
is
on
custody.
and
i
don't
think
the
rule
would
go
that
far.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
i
think
by
natural
extension,
it
could,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
we
do
raise
that
issue
too,
your
honor,
that
it
violates
double
jeopardy
because
it
is
in
effect
a
multiple
punishment.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
no
sir,
you
have
not.
and
i
state
in
my
brief
that
the
way
i
understand
it
you
have
this
issue
before
you
in
a
case,
benton
versus
maryland.
and
i
think
it's
--
it
has
been
argued
once
and
is
set
for
re-argument
squarely
presented
in
that
case.
but
in
this
--
in
patton,
when
faced
with
this
rule,
the
fourth
circuit
relied
on
the
(inaudible)
case
and
stated
that
it
was
applicable
to
the
states.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
no
sir,
there
is
not.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
well,
i
think
--
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
i
think
--
i
think
that
those
cases
if
we
make
reference
to
stroud
and
the
murphy
versus
massachusetts
that
was
the
factual
reality
that
there
was
an
increased
sentence
in
both
cases
but
i
don't
think
that
the
court
face
that
issue.
i
think
in
both
of
those
cases
that
the
argument
was
made
--
that
the
second
trial
itself
was
barred
--
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
--by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
i
think
that
was
the
--
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
--
the
fact
in
stroud
and
in
stroud
that
was
(voice
overlap).
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
i
think
in
green,
he
was
convicted
of
first
degree
--
he
was
acquitted
a
first
degree
murder,
convicted
of
second
degree
murder
and
then
a
subsequent
trial
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
and
this
court
said
that
the
conviction
of
second
degree
murder
at
the
first
trial
was
an
implied
acquittal
of
first
degree
murder
and
that's
the
basis
we
say
that
--
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
i
think
it
was
observed
that
there
can
be
no
distinction
between
the
stroud
case
and
the
green
case,
that
there
is
no
difference
--
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
think
that
was
a
sole
issue
that
was
brought
forward.
the
constitutional
arguments
that
were
made
in
this
case
were
not
made
in
stroud.
they
were
made
in
green
to
some
extent
and
in
green
it
was
held
that
person
was
impliedly
acquitted.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
maybe
not
at
that
time,
i
hope
he
would
--
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
correct.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
stroud?
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
if
the
court
have
any
further
questions?
thank
you.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
mr.

may
it

the
court.

he
still

mr.

no,

your
honor,
because
his
first
sentence
was
12
to
15
years.
he
would've
had
to
do
that
on
a
12-year
basis.
mr.

b.
sitton
that's
right.
there
would
be
no

mr.

he
makes

15

sitton
that's

that

this
in
this
case.
he
said
that
there
was
a
constitutional
defect
in
his
first
trial
and
this
was
borne
out
by
the
state
supreme
court.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that
would
be
one
way
to
get
around
this
problem
your
honor,
that's
true.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
i
think
so
and
in
north
carolina
because
they
do
have
this
credit
rule,
it
would
be
a
way
to
get
around
it
but
this
again
is
--
this
goes
into
the
function
of
the
sentencing
judge.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
yes,
sir,
i
think
it
would.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
well,
i
think
that
the
--
if
there
was
a
problem
of
prejudice
in
bringing
out
the
first
conviction
i
think
that
rule
could
be
in
such
a
situation
that
the
jury
would
be
allowed
to
set
the
sentence
and
then
it
would
be
reduced
to
bring
it
in
line
with
this
rule.
that
was
the
problem.
i
think
if
the
jury
--
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
whether
the
jury
sentences
or
the
judge
sentence.
the
risk
is
still
the
same
for
the
defendant
in
asserting
his
constitutional
right.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
well,
if
he
was
reconvicted
though,
if
he
was
not
acquitted,
then
he
would
still
under
--
even
under
this
rule
he
would
still
go
back
to
prison
or
could
conceivably
go
back
to
prison
to
serve
out
what
he
would've
had
under
this
original
sentence.
he
just
--
not
walk
out
because
of
this
rule.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
i
don't
think
the
rule
should
be
any
different,
your
honor.
the
simple
reason
that
that
if
it's
possible
under
any
circumstance
to
increase
the
sentence
because
of
additional
evidence
or
because
of
information
in
the
pre-sentence
report,
then
the
danger
still
remains
that
the
person
will
be
penalized
for
asserting
his
constitutional
right.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
it's
a
penalty
though
if
he
has
to
serve
an
increased
sentence.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
but
if
you
have
a
different
rule,
your
honor,
then
you
restrict
his
right
of
appeal.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
but
we
--
but
we
submit
your
honor
that
it
shouldn't
be
that
way.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
yes,
i
think
you
should
because
i
think
this
is
a
violation
of
the
person's
due
process,
his
right
to
due
process.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
i
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
and
that
if
a
state
has
established
a
right
to
appeal
or
a
method
of
post-conviction
review
then
it
--
once
they've
established
it,
it
should
not
be
restricted.
it
should
be
open
to
everyone.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
correct,
your
honor.
on
the
equal
protection
argument,
you
come
back
to
the
same
point
again
that
the
person's
sentence
can't
be
increased
after
he
began
serving.
so
that
the
only
class
of
persons
exposed
to
the
risk
of
increased
sentence
are
those
who
exercise
their
right
of
appeal.
we
submit
that
this
is
an
arbitrary
classification.
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
only
the
class
of
persons
who
have
won
a
new
trial
should
receive
any
harsher
sentence.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
no
sir
and
under
(inaudible)
--
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
yeah,
he's
already
spent
two
years
of
his
life
in
prison.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
yes
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
no
sir.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
the
rule
of
credit.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
no,
this
is
--
this
rule
is
of
recent
origin
and
i
don't
think
they
--
i
think
they
did
not
make
it
on
the
basis
of
the
federal
constitution.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
this
is
fair.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
think
even
if
the
state
didn't
have
the
rule
as
north
carolina
does
that
it
would
still
be
unconstitutional
and
impermissible.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
this
case,
i
don't
think
i
would
go
that
far.
it's
not
in
this
case,
of
course,
your
honor.
but
i
don't
think
the
restraint
placed
on
a
person
while
he
is
on
bail
is
the
restraint
that
is
placed
on
him
while
he
is
on
custody.
and
i
don't
think
the
rule
would
go
that
far.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
i
think
by
natural
extension,
it
could,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
we
do
raise
that
issue
too,
your
honor,
that
it
violates
double
jeopardy
because
it
is
in
effect
a
multiple
punishment.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
no
sir,
you
have
not.
and
i
state
in
my
brief
that
the
way
i
understand
it
you
have
this
issue
before
you
in
a
case,
benton
versus
maryland.
and
i
think
it's
--
it
has
been
argued
once
and
is
set
for
re-argument
squarely
presented
in
that
case.
but
in
this
--
in
patton,
when
faced
with
this
rule,
the
fourth
circuit
relied
on
the
(inaudible)
case
and
stated
that
it
was
applicable
to
the
states.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
no
sir,
there
is
not.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
well,
i
think
--
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
i
think
--
i
think
that
those
cases
if
we
make
reference
to
stroud
and
the
murphy
versus
massachusetts
that
was
the
factual
reality
that
there
was
an
increased
sentence
in
both
cases
but
i
don't
think
that
the
court
face
that
issue.
i
think
in
both
of
those
cases
that
the
argument
was
made
--
that
the
second
trial
itself
was
barred
--
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
--by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
i
think
that
was
the
--
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
--
the
fact
in
stroud
and
in
stroud
that
was
(voice
overlap).
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
i
think
in
green,
he
was
convicted
of
first
degree
--
he
was
acquitted
a
first
degree
murder,
convicted
of
second
degree
murder
and
then
a
subsequent
trial
was
convicted
of
first
degree
murder
and
this
court
said
that
the
conviction
of
second
degree
murder
at
the
first
trial
was
an
implied
acquittal
of
first
degree
murder
and
that's
the
basis
we
say
that
--
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
i
think
it
was
observed
that
there
can
be
no
distinction
between
the
stroud
case
and
the
green
case,
that
there
is
no
difference
--
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
think
that
was
a
sole
issue
that
was
brought
forward.
the
constitutional
arguments
that
were
made
in
this
case
were
not
made
in
stroud.
they
were
made
in
green
to
some
extent
and
in
green
it
was
held
that
person
was
impliedly
acquitted.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
maybe
not
at
that
time,
i
hope
he
would
--
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
that's
correct.
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
stroud?
mr.
larry
b.
sitton
if
the
court
have
any
further
questions?
thank
you.
