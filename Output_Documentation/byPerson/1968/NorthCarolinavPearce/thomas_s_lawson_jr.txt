mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
tom
lawson
and
with
mr.
oakland
melton
we
have
represented
the
defendant
or
respondent
in
this
cause
up
to
this
court.
the
facts
can
be
briefly
stated
from
our
standpoint.
mr.
rice
was
unfairly
convicted,
did
not
have
an
attorney
at
his
first
trial.
the
state
of
alabama
granted
him
a
new
trial.
at
that
trial,
they
said
mr.
rice
we
are
sorry
that
you
spent
two-and-a-half
years
in
jail
but
we
don't
recognize
that
that
exists
and
in
fact
we
are
so
sorry
that
you
spent
that
time
in
jail
that
we're
going
increase
your
sentence
on
these
three
cases
from
eight
years
to
25.
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
district
court,
the
state
of
alabama
produced
no
witnesses,
not
a
single
person
testified
for
the
state
of
alabama.
mr.
rice
testified
on
his
own
behalf
and
a
member
of
the
pardon
and
parole
board
of
the
corrections
i
think
testified
as
to
certain
time
he
spent
in
jail.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
this
is
--
mr.
justice
black,
this
is
at
the
district
court,
the
federal
district
court
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
but
at
that
case,
judge
johnson
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case
and
in
his
opinion,
it's
on
page
69
of
the
appendix
found
that
the
conclusion
is
inescapable
that
the
state
of
alabama
is
punishing
petitioner
rice
for
having
exercised
his
right
of
post-conviction
review
and
for
having
had
the
original
sentences
set
aside.
we
submit
as
the
honorable
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
louisiana
mentioned
that
this
is
a
flagrant
violation
of
mr.
rice's
constitutional
rights.
we
realized
at
the
same
time
that
this
case
is
before
the
court
primarily
because
of
the
several
splits
in
the
jurisdictions
dealing
with
the
patent
case
and
as
to
the
concepts
involved
there,
we
think
that
beyond
the
finding
of
the
district
court
that
mr.
rice
was
being
punished
for
having
made
this
appeal
that
our
case
can
be
supported
here
on
the
same
three
theories
as
the
patent
case.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
that's
right
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
your
honor,
it
gets
through
all
complicated
in
figuring
out
good
time
and
i
can't
say
offhand,
it
would
probably
be
more
than
they
would
of
six
years.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
the
law
in
alabama
has
been
changed
by
the
goolsby
case
in
that
regard.
it
now
puts
a
maximum
sealing
on
what
you
can
get
up
to
those
two
trials.
it
cannot
be
above
the
maximum
specified.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
but
in
this
case,
it
did
occur
exactly
the
same
thing
that
the
situation
that
you
said
your
honor
occurred.
in
the
first
case,
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
in
one
of
the
offenses,
that's
true.
not
--
not
on
all
three
but
because
he
had
not
entered
into
service
of
all
three
of
these
cases.
but
on
the
first
case,
he
had
served
some
two
years
of
a
four-year
sentence.
he
was
re-sentenced
to
10
years
in
jail.
so
that
basically,
had
received
two.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
sir
that
was
on
one
case.
one
case.
yes,
sir.
there
were
four
cases
originally.
one
was
nol.
pros.
and
as
judge
johnson
mentions
in
here,
on
page
71,
judge
johnson
found
that
the
case
was
not
nol.
pros.
as
the
state
contended
in
order
to
compensate
the
petitioner
for
the
time
that
he
had
served
in
the
previous
case
but
it
was
done
because
the
main
witness
that
the
state
had
to
rely
on
was
not
present.
and
of
course,
we
do
contend
and
quite
seriously
that
the
evidence
in
the
record
as
presented
to
the
district
court
is
sufficient
to
sustain
his
finding
that
mr.
rice
was
being
punished
for
exercising
his
right
of
appeal.
you
have
to
put
this
on
the
context
of
time.
the
gideon
case
have
been
decided
and
later
escobedo
and
alabama
had
been
reinstated
the
old
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
as
state
procedure
for
hearing
these
constitutional
claims.
the
habeas
corpus
in
alabama
is
not
broad
enough
to
hear
those.
and
it
was
only
after
this
had
been
done
that
mr.
rice
was
able
to
bring
these
things
before
the
state
court.
he
was
the
first
one.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
page
69,
your
honor
of
the
appendix,
the
last
part
of
the
second
paragraph.
also
in
connection
with
the
punishment,
it's
also
important
to
realize
that
this
man
was
the
first
one
to
his
knowledge
to
file
one
of
these
writs
after
the
gideon
decision
in
this
particular
county
in
alabama.
i
think
the
effect
of
this
and
the
reasons
for
it
can
be
illustrated
by
a
case,
united
states
district
court
case
in
which
the
sentencing
judge
who
was
about
to
release
someone
on
habeas
corpus
wrote
in
his
opinion
to
--
not
just
to
the
person
but
to
all
the
other
prisoners
and
he
said
let
me
remind
you
that
it
may
not
be
real
rainbow
that
you
see
these
writs
that
you
are
filing
to
get
a
fair
trial.
he
said,
at
the
end
of
that
rainbow
then
there
may
be
nothing
than
a
pot
of
fool's
gold
and
of
course
that's
--
sir?
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
fool's
gold.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
this
is
on
a
district
court
case
your
honor,
schupp
versus
sigler,
230
f.
supp.
601.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
sir?
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
just
ran
across
it.
the
point
of
law
is
not
important
but
except
the
way
that
it
expresses
it
to
show
what
these
prisoners
are
confronted
with
who
are
attempting
to
obtain
a
fair
trial.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
why
did
you
say
the
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
230
f.
supp.
607.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
not
really.
my
basic
point
to
begin
with
is,
it
goes
really
beyond
due
process
to
the
very
fundamental
concepts
of
law.
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
well,
i
can
go
back
to
chambers
versus
florida.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
well,
if
we're
going
to
a
specific
constitutional
ground,
it
would
have
to
be
due
process.
here
you
have
a
person
being
convicted
of
something
in
effect
that
is
not
a
crime.
the
only
thing
that
he
did
was
to
appeal,
a
right
which
the
state
could
give
your
honor
and
it
was
for
that
that
the
district
court
found
that
he
was
punished.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
you
have
never
held
that
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
appeal
but
this
court
has
indicated
that
perhaps
the
states
must
provide
at
least
one
means
of
reviewing
federal
questions.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
well,
sir
the
--
the
unconstitutional
conditions
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
well,
due
process
only
because
in
our
view
of
the
case,
based
at
this
point,
on
the
district
court's
findings
your
honor
and
we
got
two
different
views,
one
if
the
court
punished
him
for
something
that
was
not
a
crime,
that's
we
say
not
due
process.
that's
not
law
of
any
kind.
but
if
the
court
was
not
punishing
him
for
a
crime,
we
think
then
that
we
can
go
back
to
patton
and
to
the
basic
concept
developed
in
that
case
and
support
our
position
here.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
we
urge
all
three,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
see
a
very
keen
issue
of
equal
protection.
let's
first
take
it
as
to
the
denial
of
credit
for
time
served
and
to
take
it
one
step
further,
and
suppose
that
he
had
been
on
appeal,
instead
of
in
jail,
exercising
this
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
notice.
the
reason
for
this
is
that
in
alabama,
you
have
to
go
by
a
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
notice
after
your
appeal
time
has
run.
but
if
he
had
been
appealing,
he
would
be
denied
the
equal
protection
that
those
people
have
--
who
have
the
money
to
get
out
on
bind,
they
don't
spend
any
time
in
jail.
the
time
that
they
served
every
--
the
time
that
the
other
people
served
who
do
not
appeal,
every
minute
of
this
is
credited
to
their
sentence
but
it
is
only
this
class,
this
class
that
is
defined
one
way
and
that
is
a
class
of
people
who
had
been
denied
a
fair
trial,
a
constitutionally
fair
trial
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
--
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
no
--
no,
i
was
making
a
statement
your
honor
that
the
logic
in
this
case
becomes
more
keen
when
you
look
at
it.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
well,
in
this
case,
you
still
have
people
who
are
in
jail
under
sentence
of
law
who
are
serving
their
sentences
and
they
are
receiving
credit
for
it
and
only
these
people
who
have
been
denied
of
fair
trial
and
who
have
to
go
back
to
the
court
to
obtain
a
fair
trial
and
i'm
speaking
now
in
terms
of
due
process,
we're
not
speaking
of
state
error,
procedural
errors,
errors
in
the
admission
of
evidence
that
do
not
reach
constitutional
proportions.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
well,
if
it's
a
question
of
whether
they
--
you
have
to
provide
a
forum
for
these
people,
it
may
be
that
the
state
does
not
have
to
provide
any
method
of
appeal
on
raising
these
things
but
you
do
get
to
the
--
your
equal
protection
argument
on
this
particular
thing
is
that
the
people
who
are
sentenced
and
stay
in
jail
and
that
includes
two
classes:
those
people
who
were
denied
of
fair
trial
but
are
scared
to
get
one
and
those
people
who
had
a
fair
trial
and
had
been
convicted
and
sentenced.
they
get
credit
for
every
minute
they
are
in
jail.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
but
we
think
that
that.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
sir?
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
well,
that
necessarily
have
to
be
framed,
it
has
to
be
tried
in
the
same
day
but
we're
speaking
of
prisoners
as
a
class
and
that
they
--
these
people
who
obtained
a
sentence
whatever
the
length
of
it
is
do
not
have
this
sentences
reviewed.
it
may
be
that
that
second
person
needed
to
have
his
sentence
increased
as
much
as
the
first
person
but
if
the
state
of
alabama
believes
this
is
a
necessary
end,
in
and
of
itself,
it
can
provide
another
means
of
doing
it,
apart
from
taking
only
one
group
of
people
and
reviewing
their
convictions
and
reviewing
their
background.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
between
constitutional
reasons
and
procedural
error?
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
alright
sir.
i
think
if
you
divide
it
up
in
your
illegal
convictions
between
those
who
suffered
a
denial
of
a
fair
trial
in
a
constitutional
sense
not
having
a
lawyer
or
for
many
of
the
other
constitutional
reasons
and
those
people
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
the
difference
in
treatments,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
because
if
they
have
been
denied
a
constitutional
right
to
a
fair
trial,
they
go
back
to
seek
a
fair
trial
and
the
state
says
the
years
that
you've
served
in
jail
would
go
into
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
they
are
in
the
same
class.
they
are
prisoners
who
have
been
one
sentence.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
well,
the
class
that
i'm
intending
to
create
are
those
people
serving
in
jail
under
sentence
of
law
and
it's
within
that
class
that
i'm
speaking.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
have
not.
i
am
familiar
with
the
california
decision
of
henderson
and
people
versus
ali
which
carries
forward
your
green
case
to
support
our
contentions
here
in
this
court.
but
i'm
not
familiar
with
what
you
speak
of.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
well
sir,
i
might.
i'm
not
really
familiar
enough
to
know
how
that
works
but
that
is
the
idea
that
i
have
in
mind
of
what
the
state
could
resort
to
if
they
felt
that
this
constant
review
of
sentences
were
necessary
and
if
you
have
this
constant
review
of
sentences,
that
becomes
very
administratively
perhaps.
it
becomes
very
little
reason
for
having
it
done
by
the
court.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
public
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
well,
it
could
have
that
effect
but
i
think
if
the
--
it
would
not
have
that
effect
under
the
equal
protection
argument
that
we
make
your
honor.
it
might
well
have
in
effect
under
the
due
process
argument
or
the
double
jeopardy
argument
that
we
make.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
well,
i've
already
touched
on
i
believe
due
process
and
the
equal
protection
arguments,
our
double
jeopardy
argument
we
can
attack
in
two
concepts
really.
one,
you
can
carry
forward
this
fictitious
void
doctrine
that
began
in
stroud
and
some
of
the
earlier
cases
as
the
court
did
in
green.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
that
was
an
implied
acquittal
of
the
first-degree
murder
sentence
when
he
was
sentenced
to
second-degree
murder.
we
think
that
there's
very
little
reason
that
it
should
not
be
carried
all
the
way
forward
as
they've
done
in
california
to
apply
the
same
logic
and
reasoning
to
the
degree,
not
to
the
degree
of
the
sentence
but
to
the
time
in
jail.
some
states
divide
crimes
up
into
many
different
degrees.
others
have
only
a
very
few
but
the
end
purpose
of
both
is
to
fit
the
punishment
to
the
crime.
now,
the
only
argument
made
by
the
state
in
this
case
has
been
that
this
was
on
a
plea
of
guilty
and
because
of
that
that
the
state
ought
to
have
a
second
chance
to
look
at
it
if
the
man
decides
to
appeal.
but
i
think
we
have
to
carry
it
a
little
further
and
realize
that
it
was
on
a
plea
of
guilty
when
he
was
without
counsel.
at
that
time,
the
state's
attorney
has
a
duty
owing
to
the
state
to
see
that
he
does
not
make
an
agreement
that
will
be
sole
--
require
smaller
time
in
jail
that
the
state
would
be
jeopardized.
if
the
state's
attorney
makes
an
agreement
and
it's
adopted
by
the
court
that
it
may
well,
it
should
represent
what
the
state
is
going
to
require
of
this
crime
and
we
see
no
reason
that
the
state
is
going
to
require
of
this
crime
and
we
see
no
reason
that
the
state
should
have
a
second
chance
to
look
at
this
man,
only
this
man
not
the
others
who
may
need
their
sentences
reviewed
just
as
much.
the
other
viewpoint
of
double
jeopardy
is
the
multiple
punishment
angle
and
this
began
in
the
case
of
ex
parte
lange
some
years
ago
and
that
is
to
look
at
double
jeopardy
as
being
more
than
one
concept
but
having
three
different
parts
to
it:
retrial
after
conviction,
retrial
after
acquittal,
and
multiple
punishment
for
the
same
offense.
it
may
be
that
when
this
man
appeal
that
he
waived
his
right
against
a
double
jeopardy
not
to
be
retried
but
that
does
not
mean
that
he
necessarily
waived
his
right
to
have
that
particular
sentence
fixed
against.
i
think
that
a
lot
of
these
arguments
that
we
have
made
up
here
in
professor
van
alstyne's
article
in
the
yale
law
review
and
i'd
like
to
give
some
credit
and
mention
to
him
because
he
probably
should
be
the
one
before
the
court
today
making
the
arguments
in
these
cases
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
he
did
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
he
did
not
rest
his
opinion
on
double
jeopardy.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
agree.
i
agree
with
the
language
of
the
district
court
as
to
your
interpretation
of
it
and
i
don't
necessarily
agree
that
the
judge
should
have
stopped
at
that
point
instead
of
going
further.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
but
we
have
supported
on
that
ground
too.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
at
all
as
to
reason
for
this.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
that's
true
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
i
believe
you're
right
there
too,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes
sir,
he
did.
but
i
think
there
are
three
views
that
have
been
expounded
by
the
district
courts.
one
takes
the
view
that
there
can
be
no
increase
at
all
and
that
was
the
patton
case.
another
takes
the
view
that
there
can
be
increase
under
justifiable
circumstances
which
appear
on
the
record.
that
was
the
lower
court
case
in
the
instant
case
and
also
the
lower
court
in
the
patton
case.
the
marano
case
takes
a
position
that
there
can
be
an
increase
for
reasons
appearing,
i
believe,
for
things
that
have
occurred
after
the
first
sentence.
another
view
is
expressed
that
it
can
be
for
reasons
not
that
have
occurred
since
the
first
sentence
but
for
reasons
in
connection
with
the
crime
itself,
the
first
crime,
or
aggravated
circumstances.
therefore,
we
believe
the
simple
solution
is
to
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
your
honor,
that
view
of
the
statutory
maximum
has
bothered
me
considerably
because
it
flies
right
in
the
face
of
the
own
doctrine
that
the
courts
rely
on
and
that
is
that
the
case
is
void
for
all
reasons.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
think
he
does.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
i
believe
it's
a
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
have
nothing
further
unless
the
court
has
some
more
questions.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
tom
lawson
and
with
mr.
oakland
melton
we
have
represented
the
defendant
or
respondent
in
this
cause
up
to
this
court.
the
facts
can
be
briefly
stated
from
our
standpoint.
mr.
rice
was
unfairly
convicted,
did
not
have
an
attorney
at
his
first
trial.
the
state
of
alabama
granted
him
a
new
trial.
at
that
trial,
they
said
mr.
rice
we
are
sorry
that
you
spent
two-and-a-half
years
in
jail
but
we
don't
recognize
that
that
exists
and
in
fact
we
are
so
sorry
that
you
spent
that
time
in
jail
that
we're
going
increase
your
sentence
on
these
three
cases
from
eight
years
to
25.
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
district
court,
the
state
of
alabama
produced
no
witnesses,
not
a
single
person
testified
for
the
state
of
alabama.
mr.
rice
testified
on
his
own
behalf
and
a
member
of
the
pardon
and
parole
board
of
the
corrections
i
think
testified
as
to
certain
time
he
spent
in
jail.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
this
is
--
mr.
justice
black,
this
is
at
the
district
court,
the
federal
district
court
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
but
at
that
case,
judge
johnson
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case
and
in
his
opinion,
it's
on
page
69
of
the
appendix
found
that
the
conclusion
is
inescapable
that
the
state
of
alabama
is
punishing
petitioner
rice
for
having
exercised
his
right
of
post-conviction
review
and
for
having
had
the
original
sentences
set
aside.
we
submit
as
the
honorable
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
louisiana
mentioned
that
this
is
a
flagrant
violation
of
mr.
rice's
constitutional
rights.
we
realized
at
the
same
time
that
this
case
is
before
the
court
primarily
because
of
the
several
splits
in
the
jurisdictions
dealing
with
the
patent
case
and
as
to
the
concepts
involved
there,
we
think
that
beyond
the
finding
of
the
district
court
that
mr.
rice
was
being
punished
for
having
made
this
appeal
that
our
case
can
be
supported
here
on
the
same
three
theories
as
the
patent
case.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
that's
right
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
your
honor,
it
gets
through
all
complicated
in
figuring
out
good
time
and
i
can't
say
offhand,
it
would
probably
be
more
than
they
would
of
six
years.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
the
law
in
alabama
has
been
changed
by
the
goolsby
case
in
that
regard.
it
now
puts
a
maximum
sealing
on
what
you
can
get
up
to
those
two
trials.
it
cannot
be
above
the
maximum
specified.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
but
in
this
case,
it
did
occur
exactly
the
same
thing
that
the
situation
that
you
said
your
honor
occurred.
in
the
first
case,
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
in
one
of
the
offenses,
that's
true.
not
--
not
on
all
three
but
because
he
had
not
entered
into
service
of
all
three
of
these
cases.
but
on
the
first
case,
he
had
served
some
two
years
of
a
four-year
sentence.
he
was
re-sentenced
to
10
years
in
jail.
so
that
basically,
had
received
two.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
sir
that
was
on
one
case.
one
case.
yes,
sir.
there
were
four
cases
originally.
one
was
nol.
pros.
and
as
judge
johnson
mentions
in
here,
on
page
71,
judge
johnson
found
that
the
case
was
not
nol.
pros.
as
the
state
contended
in
order
to
compensate
the
petitioner
for
the
time
that
he
had
served
in
the
previous
case
but
it
was
done
because
the
main
witness
that
the
state
had
to
rely
on
was
not
present.
and
of
course,
we
do
contend
and
quite
seriously
that
the
evidence
in
the
record
as
presented
to
the
district
court
is
sufficient
to
sustain
his
finding
that
mr.
rice
was
being
punished
for
exercising
his
right
of
appeal.
you
have
to
put
this
on
the
context
of
time.
the
gideon
case
have
been
decided
and
later
escobedo
and
alabama
had
been
reinstated
the
old
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
as
state
procedure
for
hearing
these
constitutional
claims.
the
habeas
corpus
in
alabama
is
not
broad
enough
to
hear
those.
and
it
was
only
after
this
had
been
done
that
mr.
rice
was
able
to
bring
these
things
before
the
state
court.
he
was
the
first
one.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
page
69,
your
honor
of
the
appendix,
the
last
part
of
the
second
paragraph.
also
in
connection
with
the
punishment,
it's
also
important
to
realize
that
this
man
was
the
first
one
to
his
knowledge
to
file
one
of
these
writs
after
the
gideon
decision
in
this
particular
county
in
alabama.
i
think
the
effect
of
this
and
the
reasons
for
it
can
be
illustrated
by
a
case,
united
states
district
court
case
in
which
the
sentencing
judge
who
was
about
to
release
someone
on
habeas
corpus
wrote
in
his
opinion
to
--
not
just
to
the
person
but
to
all
the
other
prisoners
and
he
said
let
me
remind
you
that
it
may
not
be
real
rainbow
that
you
see
these
writs
that
you
are
filing
to
get
a
fair
trial.
he
said,
at
the
end
of
that
rainbow
then
there
may
be
nothing
than
a
pot
of
fool's
gold
and
of
course
that's
--
sir?
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
fool's
gold.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
this
is
on
a
district
court
case
your
honor,
schupp
versus
sigler,
230
f.
supp.
601.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
sir?
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
just
ran
across
it.
the
point
of
law
is
not
important
but
except
the
way
that
it
expresses
it
to
show
what
these
prisoners
are
confronted
with
who
are
attempting
to
obtain
a
fair
trial.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
why
did
you
say
the
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
230
f.
supp.
607.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
not
really.
my
basic
point
to
begin
with
is,
it
goes
really
beyond
due
process
to
the
very
fundamental
concepts
of
law.
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
well,
i
can
go
back
to
chambers
versus
florida.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
well,
if
we're
going
to
a
specific
constitutional
ground,
it
would
have
to
be
due
process.
here
you
have
a
person
being
convicted
of
something
in
effect
that
is
not
a
crime.
the
only
thing
that
he
did
was
to
appeal,
a
right
which
the
state
could
give
your
honor
and
it
was
for
that
that
the
district
court
found
that
he
was
punished.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
you
have
never
held
that
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
appeal
but
this
court
has
indicated
that
perhaps
the
states
must
provide
at
least
one
means
of
reviewing
federal
questions.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
well,
sir
the
--
the
unconstitutional
conditions
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
well,
due
process
only
because
in
our
view
of
the
case,
based
at
this
point,
on
the
district
court's
findings
your
honor
and
we
got
two
different
views,
one
if
the
court
punished
him
for
something
that
was
not
a
crime,
that's
we
say
not
due
process.
that's
not
law
of
any
kind.
but
if
the
court
was
not
punishing
him
for
a
crime,
we
think
then
that
we
can
go
back
to
patton
and
to
the
basic
concept
developed
in
that
case
and
support
our
position
here.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
we
urge
all
three,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
see
a
very
keen
issue
of
equal
protection.
let's
first
take
it
as
to
the
denial
of
credit
for
time
served
and
to
take
it
one
step
further,
and
suppose
that
he
had
been
on
appeal,
instead
of
in
jail,
exercising
this
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
notice.
the
reason
for
this
is
that
in
alabama,
you
have
to
go
by
a
writ
of
error
coram
nobis
notice
after
your
appeal
time
has
run.
but
if
he
had
been
appealing,
he
would
be
denied
the
equal
protection
that
those
people
have
--
who
have
the
money
to
get
out
on
bind,
they
don't
spend
any
time
in
jail.
the
time
that
they
served
every
--
the
time
that
the
other
people
served
who
do
not
appeal,
every
minute
of
this
is
credited
to
their
sentence
but
it
is
only
this
class,
this
class
that
is
defined
one
way
and
that
is
a
class
of
people
who
had
been
denied
a
fair
trial,
a
constitutionally
fair
trial
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
--
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
no
--
no,
i
was
making
a
statement
your
honor
that
the
logic
in
this
case
becomes
more
keen
when
you
look
at
it.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
well,
in
this
case,
you
still
have
people
who
are
in
jail
under
sentence
of
law
who
are
serving
their
sentences
and
they
are
receiving
credit
for
it
and
only
these
people
who
have
been
denied
of
fair
trial
and
who
have
to
go
back
to
the
court
to
obtain
a
fair
trial
and
i'm
speaking
now
in
terms
of
due
process,
we're
not
speaking
of
state
error,
procedural
errors,
errors
in
the
admission
of
evidence
that
do
not
reach
constitutional
proportions.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
that's
true
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
well,
if
it's
a
question
of
whether
they
--
you
have
to
provide
a
forum
for
these
people,
it
may
be
that
the
state
does
not
have
to
provide
any
method
of
appeal
on
raising
these
things
but
you
do
get
to
the
--
your
equal
protection
argument
on
this
particular
thing
is
that
the
people
who
are
sentenced
and
stay
in
jail
and
that
includes
two
classes:
those
people
who
were
denied
of
fair
trial
but
are
scared
to
get
one
and
those
people
who
had
a
fair
trial
and
had
been
convicted
and
sentenced.
they
get
credit
for
every
minute
they
are
in
jail.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
your
honor
but
we
think
that
that.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
sir?
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
well,
that
necessarily
have
to
be
framed,
it
has
to
be
tried
in
the
same
day
but
we're
speaking
of
prisoners
as
a
class
and
that
they
--
these
people
who
obtained
a
sentence
whatever
the
length
of
it
is
do
not
have
this
sentences
reviewed.
it
may
be
that
that
second
person
needed
to
have
his
sentence
increased
as
much
as
the
first
person
but
if
the
state
of
alabama
believes
this
is
a
necessary
end,
in
and
of
itself,
it
can
provide
another
means
of
doing
it,
apart
from
taking
only
one
group
of
people
and
reviewing
their
convictions
and
reviewing
their
background.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
between
constitutional
reasons
and
procedural
error?
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
alright
sir.
i
think
if
you
divide
it
up
in
your
illegal
convictions
between
those
who
suffered
a
denial
of
a
fair
trial
in
a
constitutional
sense
not
having
a
lawyer
or
for
many
of
the
other
constitutional
reasons
and
those
people
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
the
difference
in
treatments,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
because
if
they
have
been
denied
a
constitutional
right
to
a
fair
trial,
they
go
back
to
seek
a
fair
trial
and
the
state
says
the
years
that
you've
served
in
jail
would
go
into
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
they
are
in
the
same
class.
they
are
prisoners
who
have
been
one
sentence.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
well,
the
class
that
i'm
intending
to
create
are
those
people
serving
in
jail
under
sentence
of
law
and
it's
within
that
class
that
i'm
speaking.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
have
not.
i
am
familiar
with
the
california
decision
of
henderson
and
people
versus
ali
which
carries
forward
your
green
case
to
support
our
contentions
here
in
this
court.
but
i'm
not
familiar
with
what
you
speak
of.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
well
sir,
i
might.
i'm
not
really
familiar
enough
to
know
how
that
works
but
that
is
the
idea
that
i
have
in
mind
of
what
the
state
could
resort
to
if
they
felt
that
this
constant
review
of
sentences
were
necessary
and
if
you
have
this
constant
review
of
sentences,
that
becomes
very
administratively
perhaps.
it
becomes
very
little
reason
for
having
it
done
by
the
court.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
public
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
well,
it
could
have
that
effect
but
i
think
if
the
--
it
would
not
have
that
effect
under
the
equal
protection
argument
that
we
make
your
honor.
it
might
well
have
in
effect
under
the
due
process
argument
or
the
double
jeopardy
argument
that
we
make.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
well,
i've
already
touched
on
i
believe
due
process
and
the
equal
protection
arguments,
our
double
jeopardy
argument
we
can
attack
in
two
concepts
really.
one,
you
can
carry
forward
this
fictitious
void
doctrine
that
began
in
stroud
and
some
of
the
earlier
cases
as
the
court
did
in
green.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
that
was
an
implied
acquittal
of
the
first-degree
murder
sentence
when
he
was
sentenced
to
second-degree
murder.
we
think
that
there's
very
little
reason
that
it
should
not
be
carried
all
the
way
forward
as
they've
done
in
california
to
apply
the
same
logic
and
reasoning
to
the
degree,
not
to
the
degree
of
the
sentence
but
to
the
time
in
jail.
some
states
divide
crimes
up
into
many
different
degrees.
others
have
only
a
very
few
but
the
end
purpose
of
both
is
to
fit
the
punishment
to
the
crime.
now,
the
only
argument
made
by
the
state
in
this
case
has
been
that
this
was
on
a
plea
of
guilty
and
because
of
that
that
the
state
ought
to
have
a
second
chance
to
look
at
it
if
the
man
decides
to
appeal.
but
i
think
we
have
to
carry
it
a
little
further
and
realize
that
it
was
on
a
plea
of
guilty
when
he
was
without
counsel.
at
that
time,
the
state's
attorney
has
a
duty
owing
to
the
state
to
see
that
he
does
not
make
an
agreement
that
will
be
sole
--
require
smaller
time
in
jail
that
the
state
would
be
jeopardized.
if
the
state's
attorney
makes
an
agreement
and
it's
adopted
by
the
court
that
it
may
well,
it
should
represent
what
the
state
is
going
to
require
of
this
crime
and
we
see
no
reason
that
the
state
is
going
to
require
of
this
crime
and
we
see
no
reason
that
the
state
should
have
a
second
chance
to
look
at
this
man,
only
this
man
not
the
others
who
may
need
their
sentences
reviewed
just
as
much.
the
other
viewpoint
of
double
jeopardy
is
the
multiple
punishment
angle
and
this
began
in
the
case
of
ex
parte
lange
some
years
ago
and
that
is
to
look
at
double
jeopardy
as
being
more
than
one
concept
but
having
three
different
parts
to
it:
retrial
after
conviction,
retrial
after
acquittal,
and
multiple
punishment
for
the
same
offense.
it
may
be
that
when
this
man
appeal
that
he
waived
his
right
against
a
double
jeopardy
not
to
be
retried
but
that
does
not
mean
that
he
necessarily
waived
his
right
to
have
that
particular
sentence
fixed
against.
i
think
that
a
lot
of
these
arguments
that
we
have
made
up
here
in
professor
van
alstyne's
article
in
the
yale
law
review
and
i'd
like
to
give
some
credit
and
mention
to
him
because
he
probably
should
be
the
one
before
the
court
today
making
the
arguments
in
these
cases
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
he
did
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
he
did
not
rest
his
opinion
on
double
jeopardy.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
agree.
i
agree
with
the
language
of
the
district
court
as
to
your
interpretation
of
it
and
i
don't
necessarily
agree
that
the
judge
should
have
stopped
at
that
point
instead
of
going
further.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
but
we
have
supported
on
that
ground
too.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
at
all
as
to
reason
for
this.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
that's
true
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
i
believe
you're
right
there
too,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes
sir,
he
did.
but
i
think
there
are
three
views
that
have
been
expounded
by
the
district
courts.
one
takes
the
view
that
there
can
be
no
increase
at
all
and
that
was
the
patton
case.
another
takes
the
view
that
there
can
be
increase
under
justifiable
circumstances
which
appear
on
the
record.
that
was
the
lower
court
case
in
the
instant
case
and
also
the
lower
court
in
the
patton
case.
the
marano
case
takes
a
position
that
there
can
be
an
increase
for
reasons
appearing,
i
believe,
for
things
that
have
occurred
after
the
first
sentence.
another
view
is
expressed
that
it
can
be
for
reasons
not
that
have
occurred
since
the
first
sentence
but
for
reasons
in
connection
with
the
crime
itself,
the
first
crime,
or
aggravated
circumstances.
therefore,
we
believe
the
simple
solution
is
to
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
your
honor,
that
view
of
the
statutory
maximum
has
bothered
me
considerably
because
it
flies
right
in
the
face
of
the
own
doctrine
that
the
courts
rely
on
and
that
is
that
the
case
is
void
for
all
reasons.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
think
he
does.
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
i
believe
it's
a
--
mr.
thomas
s.
lawson,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
have
nothing
further
unless
the
court
has
some
more
questions.
