chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
vanore,
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
let
me
take
you
to
a
situation.
now,
suppose
the
judge
of
this
case,
in
the
second
trial,
have
said
that
i'll
give
you
the
same
sentence
you
were
given
in
the
first
trial,
subject
of
course
to
the
law
of
the
state
that
you're
entitled
to
credit
for
the
time
you
would
serve
plus
the
--
with
the
sentence
you
receive.
that's
one
situation.
judge
would
assume,
what
we
currently
have
here
when
the
judge
said
that,
i
(inaudible)
figure
out
myself
but
the
credit
you
were
entitled
to
under
your
first
sentence
and
what
the
time
he
served
and
i
have
no
authority
to
give
you
a
sentence
of
eight
years
this
time.
now,
i
wonder
which
of
those
two
situations
that
the
man
have
to
serve
for
his
sentence.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
just
the
question
about
the
(inaudible)
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
that's
what
i
want
(voice
overlap)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
now,
do
you
have
the
(inaudible)?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
sitton.
chief
justice
earl
warren
let's
assume
this
is
(inaudible).
if
he
had
said,
i
asked
the
counsel,
he
had
just
said,
i
wont
give
you
the
same
sentence
you
got
last
time.
15
years
less
the
time
you
got
served
plus
the
time
you
have
earned.
then
he
would've
been
alright,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
15
years,
you'd
give
him
the
same
sentence
that
you
gave
him
the
last
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
plus
he
gets
the
same
the
way
he
did.
this
man
must
serve
more
time.
chief
justice
earl
warren
(inaudible)
what
he
did
to,
other
than
that
to
serve
more
time
than
he
would
have
served
--
just
the
15-year
term
which
he
did.
chief
justice
earl
warren
so
all
we're
talking
about
is
whether
the
judge
can
give
a
greater
sentence
on
the
second
one
than
the
first
one.
chief
justice
earl
warren
and
you
both
agree
that
under
this
sentence
that
he
did
get
in
the
second
proceeding
he
must
serve
more
time
than
he
would
in
the
first.

mr.

chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
gish,
would
you
suggest
that
among
those
things
that
the
judge
takes
into
consideration
might
puzzle
the
fact
that
a
man
who
appeals
and
gets
a
reversal
should
be
punished
more
than
a
man
who
did
not
take
an
appeal?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
was
the
defendant
ever
raised
a
question
as
to
whether
the
judge
had
that
in
his
mind
or
not
when
he
sentenced
him?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
you
don't
think
that
would
be
permissible
do
you
to
have
that
ordered?
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
here
we
have
--
here
we
have
the
same
judge,
the
same
evidence
and
dismissal
of
one
of
the
charges
for
the
second
trial
and
still
the
judge
gives
him
accumulated
sentences
of
25
years
instead
of
the
10
years
that
he
gave
them
on
the
first
trial,
what
more
could
one
has
for
him
to
determine
whether
it
was
interpreted
or
not?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
that
was
in
the
--
i
thought
that
was
in
the

here.
and
then
thought
it's
the

evidence.
chief

earl

i
beg
your
pardon?
chief

chief

do
