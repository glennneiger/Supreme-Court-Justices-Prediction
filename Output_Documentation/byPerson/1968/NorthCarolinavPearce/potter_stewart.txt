justice
potter
stewart
mr.
vanore,
this
second
trial
was
held
before
the
same
judge
as
who
would
--
as
had
presided
the
first
trial
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
didn't
make
any
difference?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
both
cases,
both
the
first
trial
and
the
second
trial
in
this
case
is
what
i
mean,
the
sentence
was
imposed
by
the
judge
not
by
the
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
is
--
the
jury's
function
is
only
to
find
guilt
or
innocence?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
jury
nor
your
state
has
no
function
with
respect
to
fixing
the
severity
of
the
sentence,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
in
this
case
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
has
to
be
credited?
justice
potter
stewart
cannot
exceed
the
maximum,
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
the
statutory
maximum.
now,
you
have
already
alluded
to
your
position
which
perhaps
you'll
amplify
a
little
further
because
it's
emphasized
in
your
brief
that
it's
improper
to
assume
that
a
judge
or
a
--
whether
it
be
the
same
judge
or
another
judge
in
the
same
court
after
a
second
trial
would
be
vindictive
and
would
be
motivated
to
penalize
the
person
for
having
appealed
his
first
conviction.
i
understand
that
position.
what
would
you
say
if
there
were
proof
that
the
second
sentencing
judge
had
been
in
fact
vindictive?
what
if
he
had
been
frank
enough
to
say,
well
you
appealed
your
first
conviction
and
we
don't
--
i
don't
think
that
was
proper
--
you
what
--
put
the
state
to
a
great
deal
of
expense
and
trouble
and
now
the
juries
found
you
guilty
all
over
again.
and
since
you
did
appeal
your
first
conviction
i'm
hereby
going
to
sentence
you
to
twice
as
long
of
sentence
within
the
statutory
maximum.
justice
potter
stewart
of
what
constitutional
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
how
often
do
you
think
that
the
--
that
you
could
educe
evidence
that
the
motivation
of
the
second
sentencing
judge
was
a
vindictive
motivation
of
that
type?
justice
potter
stewart
normally
a
judge
would
simply
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
the
patton
case?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
a
different
patton
case.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
any
indication
at
all
in
this
record
as
to
why
the
second
sentencing
judge
imposed
a
greater
sentence?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
we
know
what
he
did
and
he
what
intended
to
do
and
what
in
effect
it
is.
justice
potter
stewart
my
question
was,
was
there
any
indication
as
to
why?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
think
that
in
the
absence
of
any
indication
that
this
presumption
of
judicial
good
will
and
good
faith
that
can
prevail
and
there's
no
indication
at
all
of
any
reason
whatsoever
to
impose
a
harsher
sentence
after
the
second
trial?
justice
potter
stewart
how
could
he
possibly
show?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
concede
that
a
greater
punishment
was
imposed
by
the
--
after
the
second
trial,
that's
not
an
issue
here.
you
concede
that
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
that's
true,
isn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you're
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
i
didn't
--
there's
no
issue
between
you
and
your
brother
at
the
bar
that
the
second
sentence
was
harsher.
we're
a
little
bit
confused
here
on
the
bench
because
as
i
understand
it,
you
don't
disagree
about
that
at
all.
he
got
a
more
severe
sentence
the
second
time.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
instead
of
the
judge
having
discretion
as
to
the
sentence
to
be
imposed
within
statutory
limits?
what
if
these
were
a
matter
for
the
jury
to
determine
as
is
in
fact
true
in
many
states
as
you
know,
would
the
jury
under
your
submission
on
the
second
trial
have
to
be
told
that
while
ordinarily
the
statute
gives
the
juries
in
our
state
power
to
impose
a
sentence
for
this
type
of
offense
anywhere
from
--
upon
conviction
of
this
type
of
offense
anywhere
from
probation
up
to
20
years
in
the
penitentiary
anything
in
between
while
normally
that's
the
power
given
to
a
jury?
yet
in
this
case
this
man
has
been
tried
before
and
he
was
sentenced
by
a
previous
jury
to
12
years.
and
therefore,
you
cannot
in
this
case,
if
you
convict
this
man,
sentence
him
to
more
than
12
years.
that
would
be
the
result
i
suppose
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
your
submission.
now,
wouldn't
that
pretty
well
prejudice
this
hypothetical
defendant
before
a
jury
to
be
--
to
have
the
jury
told
that
he
has
been
convicted
before
and
sentenced
to
12
years
in
penitentiary
for
the
same
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
the
other
answer
i
suppose
would
be
that
in
the
instructions,
the
judge
could
say
that
you're
limited
to
sentencing
him
upon
conviction
from
probation
to
12
years
without
giving
the
explanation
as
to
why,
i
suppose
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
risk
is
the
same
for
the
defendant
for
asserting
his
constitutional
right
but
if
he
prevails
on
appeal
then
the
--
at
least
the
conventional
theory
is
that
the
original
trial
was
wiped
out
and
he
goes
to
trial
again
and
he
has
a
very
good
opportunity
of
being
acquitted.
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
submission
would
result
in
a
heads
high,
win
tails,
you
lose
proposition
for
the
state,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
--
what
if
on
the
second
trial
all
sorts
of
evidence
comes
in
that
shows
that
he'd
be
--
the
crime
is
much
more
flagrant
than
had
--
than
the
evidence
that
shown
in
the
original
trial
or
what
if
the
pre-sentence
investigation
in
the
second
trial
shows
an
entirely
different
kind
of
character
than
the
defendant
had
been
assumed
to
have
had
on
the
first
trial
and
a
much,
much
worst
on
the
second
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
sitton,
how
far
does
your
argument
go
and
perhaps
i
shouldn't
ask
you
this,
you're
from
north
carolina,
you're
representing
the
north
carolina
petitioner.
and
the
rule
is
in
north
carolina
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
a
person
sentenced
after
a
second
conviction
has
to
be
given
credit
for
the
time
served
on
his
first
conviction
as
a
matter
of
state
law
and
that
the
total
of
that
prior
time
plus
the
new
sentence
could
not
exceed
the
statutory
maximum
as
i
understand
it
but
now
there
are
states
where
there
is
no
such
rule
of
state
law.
would
your
argument
be
that
like
this
case
the
man
is
convicted
by
a
jury
and
sentenced
by
the
judge
to
five
years
in
the
penitentiary.
he
serves
two
years
of
it
then
he
gets
his
conviction
set
aside
and
he
goes
back
for
a
new
trial,
he's
convicted
again
by
the
jury.
now,
how
much
time
of
the
penitentiary
can
the
judge
sentence
him,
to
five
years?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
that'd
be
the
same
sentence
he
got
the
first
time
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
wouldn't
be
greater.
so
you
say
the
constitutional
--
that
you
say
the
state
rule
of
north
carolina
is
also
a
constitutional,
is
also
a
rule
required
by
the
federal
constitution,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
north
--
did
--
north
carolina
didn't
say
that,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
creating
this
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
the
rule
of
credit.
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
this
is
what
we're
going
to
require
north
carolina?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
fair
in
north
carolina.
this
is
what
we're
going
to
require
but
what
--
my
question
i
think
you
understand
it
is,
what
if
a
state
doesn't
have
that
rule,
if
a
man
is
sentenced
to
five
years
in
the
penitentiary
though
in
the
first
conviction
he
gets
a
reversal
after
serving
two
years
time.
he's
tried
again
convicted
by
a
jury;
the
judge
sentences
him
to
five
years
in
the
penitentiary.
you
say
that's
not
permissible
either,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
what
case
--
i
was
--
my
question
to
you
mr.
sitton
is
going
to
be
that
even
assuming
--
even
assuming,
let's
assume
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
bill
of
rights
is
fully
applicable
to
the
states,
is
there
any
federal
case,
is
there
any
federal
that
says
that
the
sentencing
of
a
person
on
a
second
trial
after
he's
won
a
new
trial
to
a
greater
sentence
violates
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
there
was.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
in
your
brief
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lawson,
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
of
appeals
here
adopted
as
its
own
the
opinion
of
district
judge
johnson.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
not
and
of
course,
judge
johnson
decided
in
your
favor.
justice
potter
stewart
in
doing
so,
however,
he
made
very
explicit
that
he
did
not
believe
that
it
is
constitutionally
impermissible
to
impose
a
harsher
sentence
upon
retrial
if
there
is
recorded
in
the
court
record
some
legal
justification
for
it
and
i'm
quoting
from
his
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
you
remember
that
language?
justice
potter
stewart
if
--
first
of
all,
i'm
sure
you're
not
going
to
look
a
gift
horse
in
the
mouth
so
i
won't
ask
you
whether
or
not
you
don't
need
to
say
whether
or
not
you
agree
or
disagree
with
it.
but
if
he
is
correct
about
that,
if
he
is
correct
about
that
then
this
means
that
he
has
rejected
any
claim
that
this
would
violate
the
double
jeopardy
guarantee,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
could
not
have
if
he
said
it's
constitutionally
permissible,
as
he
did
trust
constitutionally
permissible.
justice
potter
stewart
under
certain
circumstances
to
impose
a
harsher
sentence.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
even
--
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
the
district
judge
is
right
in
that
statement
then
that
means
that
your
double
jeopardy
argument
is
--
cannot
prevail
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
because
if
you're
right
on
the
double
jeopardy
claim,
there
just
simply
would
be
an
absolute
prohibition
of
imposing
a
harsher
sentence.
this
is
on
the
after
the
second
trial
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
of
the
evidence
showed,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
also
your
equal
protection
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
judge
johnson
relied
rather
strangely
on
equal
protection.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
25
plus
the
time
he'd
already
served
mr.
gish.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
true
that
this
was
the
first
collateral
attack
upon
a
conviction
in
your
state
under
the
rule
of
gideon
against
wainwright?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
this
county
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
you
say
it
may
have
been
the
petitioner
alleged
that
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
don't
know
whether
it's
correct
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
is
the
--
of
course
he
wouldn't
have
the
records
available
to
him
i
presume,
only
the
state
would
or
the
court
or
the
clerk
courts
or
somebody
but.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
record,
that's
uncontradicted
testimony
at
least
that
this
was
the
first
attack
upon
a
conviction
based
upon
this
court's
decision
in
gideon
against
wainwright
in
this
county
in
alabama.
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
from
that
fact,
as
well
as
from
the
state's
failure
to
present
any
witnesses,
the
habeas
corpus
hearings
and
perhaps
some
other
circumstances,
judge
frank
johnson
the
federal
district
judge
in
this
case
concluded
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
reason
for
imposing
the
harsher
sentence
was
the
vindictive
reason
of
penalizing
this
petitioner's
attacked
on
a
sentence
under
a
decision
of
this
court,
is
that
correct?
is
that
fairly
said?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
vanore,
this
second
trial
was
held
before
the
same
judge
as
who
would
--
as
had
presided
the
first
trial
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
didn't
make
any
difference?
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
both
cases,
both
the
first
trial
and
the
second
trial
in
this
case
is
what
i
mean,
the
sentence
was
imposed
by
the
judge
not
by
the
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
is
--
the
jury's
function
is
only
to
find
guilt
or
innocence?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
jury
nor
your
state
has
no
function
with
respect
to
fixing
the
severity
of
the
sentence,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
in
this
case
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
has
to
be
credited?
justice
potter
stewart
cannot
exceed
the
maximum,
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
the
statutory
maximum.
now,
you
have
already
alluded
to
your
position
which
perhaps
you'll
amplify
a
little
further
because
it's
emphasized
in
your

would
be
vindictive
and
would
be
motivated
to
penalize
the
person
for
having
appealed
his
first
conviction.
i
understand
that
position.
what
would
you
say
if
there
were
proof
that
the
second
sentencing
judge
had
been
in
fact
vindictive?
what
if
he
had
been
frank
enough
to

well
you
appealed
your
first
conviction
and
we
don't

i
don't

yes.

a

case.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice

stewart
is
there
any
indication
at

in
this

as
to
why
the

imposed
a

justice

yes,

we

what

that's

isn't

justice

you're

excuse

i
didn't

there's
no

between

we're

i
understand
it,
you
don't
disagree
about
that
at
all.
he
got
a
more
severe
sentence
the
second
time.
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
instead
of
the
judge
having
discretion
as
to
the
sentence
to
be
imposed
within
statutory
limits?
what
if
these
were
a
matter
for
the
jury
to
determine
as
is
in
fact
true
in
many
states
as
you
know,
would
the
jury
under
your
submission
on
the
second
trial
have
to
be
told
that
while
ordinarily
the
statute
gives
the
juries
in
our
state
power
to
impose
a
sentence
for
this
type
of
offense
anywhere
from
--
upon
conviction
of
this
type
of
offense
anywhere
from
probation
up
to
20
years
in
the
penitentiary
anything
in
between
while
normally
that's
the
power
given
to
a
jury?
yet
in
this
case
this
man
has
been
tried
before
and
he
was
sentenced
by
a
previous
jury
to
12
years.
and
therefore,
you
cannot
in
this
case,
if
you
convict
this
man,
sentence
him
to
more
than
12
years.
that
would
be
the
result
i
suppose
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
your
submission.
now,
wouldn't
that
pretty
well
prejudice
this
hypothetical
defendant
before
a
jury
to
be
--
to
have
the
jury
told
that
he
has
been
convicted
before
and
sentenced
to
12
years
in
penitentiary
for
the
same
offense?
justice
potter
stewart
the
other
answer
i
suppose
would
be
that
in
the
instructions,
the
judge
could
say
that
you're
limited
to
sentencing
him
upon
conviction
from
probation
to
12
years
without
giving
the
explanation
as
to
why,
i
suppose
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
risk
is
the
same
for
the
defendant
for
asserting
his
constitutional
right
but
if
he
prevails
on
appeal
then
the
--
at
least
the
conventional
theory
is
that
the
original
trial
was
wiped
out
and
he
goes
to
trial
again
and
he
has
a
very
good
opportunity
of
being
acquitted.
justice
potter
stewart
and
your
submission
would
result
in
a
heads
high,
win
tails,
you
lose
proposition
for
the
state,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what
if
--
what
if
on
the
second
trial
all
sorts
of
evidence
comes
in
that
shows
that
he'd
be
--
the
crime
is
much
more
flagrant
than
had
--
than
the
evidence
that
shown
in
the
original
trial
or
what
if
the
pre-sentence
investigation
in
the
second
trial
shows
an
entirely
different
kind
of
character
than
the
defendant
had
been
assumed
to
have
had
on
the
first
trial
and
a
much,
much
worst
on
the
second
trial.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
sitton,
how
far
does
your
argument
go
and
perhaps
i
shouldn't
ask
you
this,
you're
from
north
carolina,
you're
representing
the
north
carolina
petitioner.
and
the
rule
is
in
north
carolina
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
a
person
sentenced
after
a
second
conviction
has
to
be
given
credit
for
the
time
served
on
his
first
conviction
as
a
matter
of
state
law
and
that
the
total
of
that
prior
time
plus
the
new
sentence
could
not
exceed
the
statutory
maximum
as
i
understand
it
but
now
there
are
states
where
there
is
no
such
rule
of
state
law.
would
your
argument
be
that
like
this
case
the
man
is
convicted
by
a
jury
and
sentenced
by
the
judge
to
five
years
in
the
penitentiary.
he
serves
two
years
of
it
then
he
gets
his
conviction
set
aside
and
he
goes
back
for
a
new
trial,
he's
convicted
again
by
the
jury.
now,
how
much
time
of
the
penitentiary
can
the
judge
sentence
him,
to
five
years?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
that'd
be
the
same
sentence
he
got
the
first
time
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
it
wouldn't
be
greater.
so
you
say
the
constitutional
--
that
you
say
the
state
rule
of
north
carolina
is
also
a
constitutional,
is
also
a
rule
required
by
the
federal
constitution,
do
you?
justice
potter
stewart
north
--
did
--
north
carolina
didn't
say
that,
did
it?
justice
potter
stewart
in
creating
this
rule.
justice
potter
stewart
the
rule
of
credit.
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
this
is
what
we're
going
to
require
north
carolina?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
fair
in
north
carolina.
this
is
what
we're
going
to
require
but
what
--
my
question
i
think
you
understand
it
is,
what
if
a
state
doesn't
have
that
rule,
if
a
man
is
sentenced
to
five
years
in
the
penitentiary
though
in
the
first
conviction
he
gets
a
reversal
after
serving
two
years
time.
he's
tried
again
convicted
by
a
jury;
the
judge
sentences
him
to
five
years
in
the
penitentiary.
you
say
that's
not
permissible
either,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
what
case
--
i
was
--
my
question
to
you
mr.
sitton
is
going
to
be
that
even
assuming
--
even
assuming,
let's
assume
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
bill
of
rights
is
fully
applicable
to
the
states,
is
there
any
federal
case,
is
there
any
federal
that
says
that
the
sentencing
of
a
person
on
a
second
trial
after
he's
won
a
new
trial
to
a
greater
sentence
violates
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
there
was.
justice
potter
stewart
that's
in
your
brief
or
not?
justice
potter
stewart
is
that
in
your
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
lawson,
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt.
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
of
appeals
here
adopted
as
its
own
the
opinion
of
district
judge
johnson.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
not
and
of
course,
judge
johnson
decided
in
your
favor.
justice
potter
stewart
in
doing
so,
however,
he
made
very
explicit
that
he
did
not
believe
that
it
is
constitutionally
impermissible
to
impose
a
harsher
sentence
upon
retrial
if
there
is
recorded
in
the
court
record
some
legal
justification
for
it
and
i'm
quoting
from
his
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
you
remember
that
language?
justice
potter
stewart
if
--
first
of
all,
i'm
sure
you're
not
going
to
look
a
gift
horse
in
the
mouth
so
i
won't
ask
you
whether
or
not
you
don't
need
to
say
whether
or
not
you
agree
or
disagree
with
it.
but
if
he
is
correct
about
that,
if
he
is
correct
about
that
then
this
means
that
he
has
rejected
any
claim
that
this
would
violate
the
double
jeopardy
guarantee,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
could
not
have
if
he
said
it's
constitutionally
permissible,
as
he
did
trust
constitutionally
permissible.
justice
potter
stewart
under
certain
circumstances
to
impose
a
harsher
sentence.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
even
--
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
the
district
judge
is
right
in
that
statement
then
that
means
that
your
double
jeopardy
argument
is
--
cannot
prevail
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
because
if
you're
right
on
the
double
jeopardy
claim,
there
just
simply
would
be
an
absolute
prohibition
of
imposing
a
harsher
sentence.
this
is
on
the
after
the
second
trial
no
matter
what
the
circumstances
of
the
evidence
showed,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
also
your
equal
protection
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
judge
johnson
relied
rather
strangely
on
equal
protection.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
25
plus
the
time
he'd
already
served
mr.
gish.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
is
it
true
that
this
was
the
first
collateral
attack
upon
a
conviction
in
your
state
under
the
rule
of
gideon
against
wainwright?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
this
county
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
now
you
say
it
may
have
been
the
petitioner
alleged
that
it
was.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
don't
know
whether
it's
correct
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
is
the
--
of
course
he
wouldn't
have
the
records
available
to
him
i
presume,
only
the
state
would
or
the
court
or
the
clerk
courts
or
somebody
but.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
record,
that's
uncontradicted
testimony
at
least
that
this
was
the
first
attack
upon
a
conviction
based
upon
this
court's
decision
in
gideon
against
wainwright
in
this
county
in
alabama.
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
from
that
fact,
as
well
as
from
the
state's
failure
to
present
any
witnesses,
the
habeas
corpus
hearings
and
perhaps
some
other
circumstances,
judge
frank
johnson
the
federal
district
judge
in
this
case
concluded
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
reason
for
imposing
the
harsher
sentence
was
the
vindictive
reason
of
penalizing
this
petitioner's
attacked
on
a
sentence
under
a
decision
of
this
court,
is
that
correct?
is
that
fairly
said?
