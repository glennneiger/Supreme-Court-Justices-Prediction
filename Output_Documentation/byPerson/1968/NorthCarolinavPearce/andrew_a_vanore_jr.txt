mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
andrew
a.
vanore
jr.,
i'm
a
member
of
the
staff
for
the
attorney
general
of
north
carolina
and
i
represent
the
petitioners,
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
warden
r.l.
turner
in
this
particular
case.
the
single
issue
involved
in
this
particular
case
is
upon
retrial
for
the
same
offense
which
has
been
set
aside
on
appeal
or
post-conviction
proceeding
due
to
a
constitutional
defect
in
the
first
trial,
may
the
second
trial
court
impose
a
harsher
punishment
upon
the
defendant.
the
facts
briefly
stated
are
clifton
a.
pearce,
the
respondent
in
this
particular
case,
was
initially
tried
at
the
may
1961
term
of
the
superior
court
of
durham
county,
north
carolina
on
the
capital
charge
of
rape.
upon
arraignment,
the
prosecuting
attorney
or
the
solicitor
announced
that
he
would
not
seek
a
verdict
in
excess
of
assault
with
intent
to
commit
rape.
the
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty
of
assault
with
intent
to
commit
rape
and
the
judge
imposed
a
sentence
of
12
to
15
years
upon
the
defendant.
the
defendant
started
serving
the
sentence
on
may
25,
1961.
in
1965,
the
defendant
filed
a
petition
under
the
post-conviction
relief
act
questioning
the
admissibility
of
a
confession
introduced
against
him
in
the
first
trial.
relief
was
denied
by
the
superior
court
of
durham
county
on
may
10,
1965
and
certiorari
was
accepted
by
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
which
reversed
the
case
and
awarded
the
defendant
a
new
trial.
the
defendant
was
released
from
custody
upon
the
first
sentence
imposed
upon
him
on
february
2,
1966.
at
that
particular
time,
he
had
served
four
years,
eight
months
and
six
days
flat
time
and
six
years,
seven
months
and
16
days
flat
and
gain
time.
the
gain
time
being
computed
upon
150
days
granted
to
the
defendant
for
each
year
of
service
on
the
sentence.
the
defendant
was
tried
the
second
time
at
the
june
6,
1966
term
of
the
superior
court
of
durham
county
upon
an
indictment
charging
assault
with
intent
to
commit
rape.
the
jury
found
him
guilty
of
assault
with
intent
to
commit
rape
and
the
presiding
judge
who
specifically
stated
in
his
judgment
that
he
was
taking
into
consideration
the
fact
that
the
defendant
had
served
six
years,
seven
months
and
16
days
flat
and
gain
time
was
going
to
impose
only
a
sentence
of
eight
years
upon
the
defendant.
the
judge
stated
in
his
judgment
that
it
was
his
intention
to
impose
the
maximum
sentence
allowed
by
statute
for
the
offense
which
is
15
years
however,
because
of
the
gain
time
and
so
forth
he
reduced
it
to
eight
years.
in
march
19
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
rule
as
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
rule
announced
by
the
supreme
court.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
includes
gain
time,
yes
sir.
all
credits
served
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
--
upon
the
board,
its
sentence.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
trial
judge
in
taking
into
consideration
the
gain
and
flat
time
that
the
defendant
it
served,
reduced
it
or
deducted
it
from
the
maximum
sentence
allowed
under
statute,
15
years.
he
did
not
reduce
it
from
the
minimum
sentence
that
was
imposed
upon
the
defendant
at
the
first
trial
that
means
12
years.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
the
sentence
was
eight
years.
however,
the
judge
said,
it
is
my
intention
to
give
you
a
sentence
of
15
years.
however,
since
you
have
served
this
particular
flat
and
gain
time
upon
the
first
sentence
which
was
less
than
seven
years,
since
you
have
served
that
time,
i
am
going
to
deduct
that
time
from
the
maximum
of
15
years
and
impose
an
eight-year
sentence
upon
you.
the
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
he
did
in
fact
get
eight
years.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct,
assuming
that
the
second
trial
judge
would
be
prohibited
from
increasing
his
sentence
upon
the
second
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
oh,
i
think
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
it
applies
to
the
eight-year
sentence,
yes
but
i
--
perhaps
i'm
not
making
myself
clear
justice
fortas.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it.
because
of
the
eight-year
sentence,
he
is
going
to
have
to
serve
some
additional
time
other
than
he
would've
been
required
to
serve
under
the
first
sentence.
but
the
reasoning
of
the
trial
judge
is
that
he
could
have
in
fact
imposed
a
15-year
sentence
and
if
you
give
him
all
credit
for
time
served
under
the
15-year
sentence
which
he
is
required
to
do
by
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
--
then
he
still
in
fact
has
left
to
serve
seven
years.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
it
does
if
you
compute
the
time
that
he
would
have
to
serve
in
--
on
the
end
of
terminate
sentence,
the
12
to
15
years
if
you
compute
it
from
the
lesser
of
the
two
sentences
imposed
from
the
12-year
sentence.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
he
would
be
entitled
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
he
would've
been
entitled
to
get
out
after
having
served
eight
years,
five
months
and
22
days
of
actual
time
on
the
first
sentence.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
now
there's
a
statute
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
if
we
were
to
assume
that
he
would
be
given
credit
under
both
of
these
sentences,
the
defendant
would
have
to
serve
an
additional
sentence
of
one
year,
10
months
and
10
days
because
of
the
new
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
of
course
the
district
court
thought
so
and
the
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
--
fourth
circuit
of
appeals
thought
so.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
the
district
court
who
saw
the
opinion
based
on
the
fourth
circuit
court's
opinion
in
patton
that
the
flat
and
gain
time
served
under
the
original
sentence
would
have
to
be
deducted
from
the
minimum
of
an
indeterminate
sentence
and
since
it
was
not
deducted
from
the
12
years
but
rather
from
the
15
years
that
was
the
infirmity
that
the
district
court
found
in
this
particular
sentence.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes,
he
is
out
on
bail
now,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
approximately,
six
months
ago.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no,
i
believe
that
he
would
still
have
to
serve
approximately
a
year-and-a-half
of
the
second
sentence.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
not
computing
the
time
that
he's
been
out
on
bail,
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
no.
i
don't
quite
agree
with
you
justice
marshall.
i
think
that
here,
we
have
two
points
that
we
must
consider.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
i'm
sure
he
feels
that
way,
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
do
not
think
so
based
on
the
principle
of
law
that
i
think
the
case
brings
up
before
this
court
whether
or
not
the
patton
rule
which
prohibits
an
increase
sentence
or
which
prohibits
the
state
from
giving
the
man
a
sentence
over
and
above
the
sentence
that
was
given
at
the
first
trial.
i
think
that
the
--
that
question
is
a
very
basis
of
our
system
of
jurisprudence
and
that
it
assumes
that
the
trial
judge,
the
second
trial
judge
is
going
to
punish
this
man
for
exercising
a
constitutional
right
of
appeal.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
he
would
have
to
serve
the
same
amount
of
time
under
both
situations.
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
question
then.
oh,
he
would
have
to
serve
more
time
under
the
second
situation,
i
beg
your
pardon.
excuse
me,
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
so
long
as
it
comes
within
the
statutory
maximum
allowed
for
by
the
statute,
yes.
i
think
that
is
the
question
whether
or
not
a
judge
can
give
more
time
on
the
second
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
by
--
the
judge
takes
in
--
the
second
sentencing
judge
takes
into
consideration
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
it's
done
both
ways,
he
can
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes,
he
can
say
that
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
will
credit
you
for
time
served,
yes
or
he
can
compute
it
himself
as
he
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
--
it's
clear
to
me.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no,
they
gave
him
credit
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes,
yes.
he
gave
him
--
he
specifically
stated
in
giving
him
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct
because
at
the
time
the
second
sentencing
judge
imposed
sentence
he
had
before
him
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes.
he
had
before
him
the
prison
records
which
showed
exactly
how
much
gain
and
flat
time
this
defendant
had
served
on
the
first
sentence.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no,
that's
true.
if
we
compute
it
from
the
maximum
that
would
be
allowable
under
the
statute,
he
still
has
approximately
almost
six
years
to
serve
under
--
even
by
way
of
the
patton
court's
reasoning,
he
would
have
an
additional
time
to
serve.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
and
i
believe
that
judge
butler
points
that
out
in
his
order
ordering
the
state
to
resentence
him
or
to
release
him
and
of
course
the
state
when
it
came
on
for
hearing
before
the
state
judge,
the
judge
refused
to
order
this
man
resentence
and
judge
butler
thereupon
entered
an
order
requiring
his
immediate
release
and
that
is
why
we
appealed
to
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
in
a
memorandum
decision
based
upon
patton
versus
north
carolina
affirmed
the
district
court's
holding.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
no.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
argument
might
be
greater
if
it
were
held
before
the
same
trial
judge
as
was
done
in
the
sanders
case
from
california
that
the
second
trial
judge
might
have
more
reason
perhaps
if
we
want
to
assume
that
the
trial
judge
is
going
to
be
vindictive,
that
the
second
judge
might
have
more
reason
for
imposing
a
harsher
sentence.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
it
is
imposed
by
the
judge
in
north
carolina
by
statute.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
except
in
a
capital
case,
the
jury
can
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
without
leniency
and
thereupon
the
defendant
is
sentenced
to
death.
however,
they
can
impose
leniency
and
the
statute
provides
automatically
for
a
life
imprisonment.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes,
this
kind
of
a
case,
the
judge
has
the
complete
unfettered
discretion
to
impose
any
sentence
which
he
deems
necessary
under
the
facts.
the
only
prohibition
that
is
put
upon
the
second
sentencing
judge
is
that
the
time
served
under
the
first
sentence
which
was
voided
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
has
to
be
credited
and
the
time
served
under
the
first
sentence
and
the
time
imposed
under
the
second
sentence
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
--
cannot
exceed
that
maximum
allowed
by
the
statute.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
would
be
a
flagrant
violation
of
the
man's
constitutional
right
to
appeal
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
the
constitutional
right
to
appeal
without
any
fear
of
reprisal.
and
our
supreme
court
so
held
in
a
case
called
state
versus
patton
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
--
where
the
sentencing
judge
--
yes,
first
imposed
the
fine
on
the
individual.
and
then
the
individual
gave
notice
of
appeal
and
the
sentencing
judge
thereupon
struck
his
first
sentence
of
a
fine
and
imposed
active
time.
our
supreme
court
said
that
this
was
a
flagrant
violation
of
the
man's
constitutional
right
to
appeal
without
fear
of
any
reprisal.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
think
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
educe
that
type
of
evidence
but
i
think
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
think
that
we
have
--
yes.
i
think
that
we
have
to
presume
though
since
--
as
i
see
it,
our
whole
system
is
based
upon
the
good
faith
of
judges.
we
have
to
assume
that
the
sentencing
judge
is
not
going
to
be
vindictive
and
if
he
were
vindictive,
he
could
easily
circumvent
the
rule
that
was
applied
in
patton
by
imposing
the
maximum
sentence
the
first
time
around
and
then
there
would
never
be
any
question
about
it.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
under
the
state
and
federal
constitution.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
--
that
is
not
eddie
patton
that
was
decided
by
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
it
is
a
different
patton
case.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
of
course
our
supreme
court
has
already
upheld
in
a
similar
situation
as
is
now
before
the
court
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
pearce
case
itself
that
the
second
sentencing
judge
properly
within
his
discretion
imposed
the
eight-year
sentence.
they
found
no
violation
of
the
man's
constitutional
right.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
think
the
only
indication
is
that
the
second
sentencing
judge
intended
to
impose
the
maximum,
the
15
years.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
there
is
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no,
there
is
not.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
think
it
should,
i
think
the
burden
should
be
upon
the
defendant
to
show.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
it
depends
upon
the
disparity
between
the
two
sentences
that
were
imposed.
here,
we're
talking
about
a
very
short
period
of
time.
if
the
defendant
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes,
that
is
true.
my
argument
would
be
that
rather
than
adopt
the
flat
prohibition
set
forth
in
patton
if
the
court
were
not
--
of
the
opinion
that
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant
to
show
abuse
that
the
position
should
be
if
any
additional
evidence
is
shown
at
the
second
trial
then
the
trial
judge
should
have
complete
discretion
in
imposing
a
harsher
sentence
upon
the
defendant
than
was
imposed
at
the
first
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
if
a
new
trial
is
awarded
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
i
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
of
course
our
argument
is
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
we
must
assume
that
the
trial
judge
had
some
good
reason
in
imposing
a
harsher
sentence.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
think
definitely
he
should
give
his
reasons,
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
i
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
in
a
very
recent
decision,
state
versus
stafford
which
is
cited
in
the
state's
brief
stated
that
the
burden
should
be
upon
the
defendant
to
show
abuse.
however,
it
would
be
more
orderly
if
they
--
if
there
was
evidence
or
if
the
judge
stated
his
reasons
into
the
record
as
to
why
an
increased
sentence
was
given.
the
main
contention
that
we
have
here
is
that
the
flat
prohibition
laid
down
in
the
patton
case
than
you
can
never
no
matter
what
the
evidence
is
at
the
second
trial.
you
can
never
exceed
the
sentence
imposed
at
the
first
trial.
we
think
that
that
is
a
flagrant
violation
of
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
to
impose
a
proper
sentence
and
the
discretion
of
the
state
legislature
to
fix
a
punishment
for
a
particular
crime.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
of
course,
the
defendant
is
the
one
that
has
to
request
the
new
trial,
the
state
can't
go
in
on
its
own
initiative
and
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
i'll
pay
him
to
appeal
or
try
to
get
a
new
trial
under
the
post-conviction
hearing
act.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
i
believe
that
i
have
tried
to
make
my
position
clear
in
this
particular
case
that
the
second
sentencing
judge
deducted
that
gain
and
flat
time
from
the
maximum
that
he
could've
imposed
under
the
offense,
15
years
and
not
under
the
minimum
and
that
was
the
violation
which
the
district
court
and
the
fourth
circuit
court
found
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
it
would
seem
that
the
record
does
show
that
justice
black.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
second
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina,
the
supreme
court
so
stated
that
in
their
fact
--
situation
that
the
evidence
was
essentially
the
same.
of
course,
there
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
believe
it
was
a
different
judge,
i
think
the
record
would
show
that.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no,
i
mean
--
as
i
recall
i
am
fairly
sure
that
the
judge
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
if
this
court
has
any
further
questions?
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
andrew
a.
vanore
jr.,
i'm
a
member
of
the
staff
for
the
attorney
general
of
north
carolina
and
i
represent
the
petitioners,
the
state
of
north
carolina
and
warden
r.l.
turner
in
this
particular
case.
the
single
issue
involved
in
this
particular
case
is
upon
retrial
for
the
same
offense
which
has
been
set
aside
on
appeal
or
post-conviction
proceeding
due
to
a
constitutional
defect
in
the
first
trial,
may
the
second
trial
court
impose
a
harsher
punishment
upon
the
defendant.
the
facts
briefly
stated
are
clifton
a.
pearce,
the
respondent
in
this
particular
case,
was
initially
tried
at
the
may
1961
term
of
the
superior
court
of
durham
county,
north
carolina
on
the
capital
charge
of
rape.
upon
arraignment,
the
prosecuting
attorney
or
the
solicitor
announced
that
he
would
not
seek
a
verdict
in
excess
of
assault
with
intent
to
commit
rape.
the
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty
of
assault
with
intent
to
commit
rape
and
the
judge
imposed
a
sentence
of
12
to
15
years
upon
the
defendant.
the
defendant
started
serving
the
sentence
on
may
25,
1961.
in
1965,
the
defendant
filed
a
petition
under
the
post-conviction
relief
act
questioning
the
admissibility
of
a
confession
introduced
against
him
in
the
first
trial.
relief
was
denied
by
the
superior
court
of
durham
county
on
may
10,
1965
and
certiorari
was
accepted
by
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
which
reversed
the
case
and
awarded
the
defendant
a
new
trial.
the
defendant
was
released
from
custody
upon
the
first
sentence
imposed
upon
him
on
february
2,
1966.
at
that
particular
time,
he
had
served
four
years,
eight
months
and
six
days
flat
time
and
six
years,
seven
months
and
16
days
flat
and
gain
time.
the
gain
time
being
computed
upon
150
days
granted
to
the
defendant
for
each
year
of
service
on
the
sentence.
the
defendant
was
tried
the
second
time
at
the
june
6,
1966
term
of
the
superior
court
of
durham
county
upon
an
indictment
charging
assault
with
intent
to
commit
rape.
the
jury
found
him
guilty
of
assault
with
intent
to
commit
rape
and
the
presiding
judge
who
specifically
stated
in
his
judgment
that
he
was
taking
into
consideration
the
fact
that
the
defendant
had
served
six
years,
seven
months
and
16
days
flat
and
gain
time
was
going
to
impose
only
a
sentence
of
eight
years
upon
the
defendant.
the
judge
stated
in
his
judgment
that
it
was
his
intention
to
impose
the
maximum
sentence
allowed
by
statute
for
the
offense
which
is
15
years
however,
because
of
the
gain
time
and
so
forth
he
reduced
it
to
eight
years.
in
march
19
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
rule
as
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
rule
announced
by
the
supreme
court.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
includes
gain
time,
yes
sir.
all
credits
served
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
--
upon
the
board,
its
sentence.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
trial
judge
in
taking
into
consideration
the
gain
and
flat
time
that
the
defendant
it
served,
reduced
it
or
deducted
it
from
the
maximum
sentence
allowed
under
statute,
15
years.
he
did
not
reduce
it
from
the
minimum
sentence
that
was
imposed
upon
the
defendant
at
the
first
trial
that
means
12
years.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
the
sentence
was
eight
years.
however,
the
judge
said,
it
is
my
intention
to
give
you
a
sentence
of
15
years.
however,
since
you
have
served
this
particular
flat
and
gain
time
upon
the
first
sentence
which
was
less
than
seven
years,
since
you
have
served
that
time,
i
am
going
to
deduct
that
time
from
the
maximum
of
15
years
and
impose
an
eight-year
sentence
upon
you.
the
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
he
did
in
fact
get
eight
years.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct,
assuming
that
the
second
trial
judge
would
be
prohibited
from
increasing
his
sentence
upon
the
second
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
oh,
i
think
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
it
applies
to
the
eight-year
sentence,
yes
but
i
--
perhaps
i'm
not
making
myself
clear
justice
fortas.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
it.
because
of
the
eight-year
sentence,
he
is
going
to
have
to
serve
some
additional
time
other
than
he
would've
been
required
to
serve
under
the
first
sentence.
but
the
reasoning
of
the
trial
judge
is
that
he
could
have
in
fact
imposed
a
15-year
sentence
and
if
you
give
him
all
credit
for
time
served
under
the
15-year
sentence
which
he
is
required
to
do
by
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
--
then
he
still
in
fact
has
left
to
serve
seven
years.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
it
does
if
you
compute
the
time
that
he
would
have
to
serve
in
--
on
the
end
of
terminate
sentence,
the
12
to
15
years
if
you
compute
it
from
the
lesser
of
the
two
sentences
imposed
from
the
12-year
sentence.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
he
would
be
entitled
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
he
would've
been
entitled
to
get
out
after
having
served
eight
years,
five
months
and
22
days
of
actual
time
on
the
first
sentence.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
now
there's
a
statute
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
if
we
were
to
assume
that
he
would
be
given
credit
under
both
of
these
sentences,
the
defendant
would
have
to
serve
an
additional
sentence
of
one
year,
10
months
and
10
days
because
of
the
new
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
of
course
the
district
court
thought
so
and
the
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
--
fourth
circuit
of
appeals
thought
so.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
the
district
court
who
saw
the
opinion
based
on
the
fourth
circuit
court's
opinion
in
patton
that
the
flat
and
gain
time
served
under
the
original
sentence
would
have
to
be
deducted
from
the
minimum
of
an
indeterminate
sentence
and
since
it
was
not
deducted
from
the
12
years
but
rather
from
the
15
years
that
was
the
infirmity
that
the
district
court
found
in
this
particular
sentence.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes,
he
is
out
on
bail
now,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
approximately,
six
months
ago.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no,
i
believe
that
he
would
still
have
to
serve
approximately
a
year-and-a-half
of
the
second
sentence.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
not
computing
the
time
that
he's
been
out
on
bail,
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
no.
i
don't
quite
agree
with
you
justice
marshall.
i
think
that
here,
we
have
two
points
that
we
must
consider.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
i'm
sure
he
feels
that
way,
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
do
not
think
so
based
on
the
principle
of
law
that
i
think
the
case
brings
up
before
this
court
whether
or
not
the
patton
rule
which
prohibits
an
increase
sentence
or
which
prohibits
the
state
from
giving
the
man
a
sentence
over
and
above
the
sentence
that
was
given
at
the
first
trial.
i
think
that
the
--
that
question
is
a
very
basis
of
our
system
of
jurisprudence
and
that
it
assumes
that
the
trial
judge,
the
second
trial
judge
is
going
to
punish
this
man
for
exercising
a
constitutional
right
of
appeal.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
he
would
have
to
serve
the
same
amount
of
time
under
both
situations.
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
question
then.
oh,
he
would
have
to
serve
more
time
under
the
second
situation,
i
beg
your
pardon.
excuse
me,
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
so
long
as
it
comes
within
the
statutory
maximum
allowed
for
by
the
statute,
yes.
i
think
that
is
the
question
whether
or
not
a
judge
can
give
more
time
on
the
second
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
by
--
the
judge
takes
in
--
the
second
sentencing
judge
takes
into
consideration
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
it's
done
both
ways,
he
can
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes,
he
can
say
that
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
will
credit
you
for
time
served,
yes
or
he
can
compute
it
himself
as
he
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
--
it's
clear
to
me.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no,
they
gave
him
credit
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes,
yes.
he
gave
him
--
he
specifically
stated
in
giving
him
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct
because
at
the
time
the
second
sentencing
judge
imposed
sentence
he
had
before
him
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes.
he
had
before
him
the
prison
records
which
showed
exactly
how
much
gain
and
flat
time
this
defendant
had
served
on
the
first
sentence.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no,
that's
true.
if
we
compute
it
from
the
maximum
that
would
be
allowable
under
the
statute,
he
still
has
approximately
almost
six
years
to
serve
under
--
even
by
way
of
the
patton
court's
reasoning,
he
would
have
an
additional
time
to
serve.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
and
i
believe
that
judge
butler
points
that
out
in
his
order
ordering
the
state
to
resentence
him
or
to
release
him
and
of
course
the
state
when
it
came
on
for
hearing
before
the
state
judge,
the
judge
refused
to
order
this
man
resentence
and
judge
butler
thereupon
entered
an
order
requiring
his
immediate
release
and
that
is
why
we
appealed
to
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
which
in
a
memorandum
decision
based
upon
patton
versus
north
carolina
affirmed
the
district
court's
holding.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
no.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
the
argument
might
be
greater
if
it
were
held
before
the
same
trial
judge
as
was
done
in
the
sanders
case
from
california
that
the
second
trial
judge
might
have
more
reason
perhaps
if
we
want
to
assume
that
the
trial
judge
is
going
to
be
vindictive,
that
the
second
judge
might
have
more
reason
for
imposing
a
harsher
sentence.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
it
is
imposed
by
the
judge
in
north
carolina
by
statute.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
except
in
a
capital
case,
the
jury
can
return
a
verdict
of
guilty
without
leniency
and
thereupon
the
defendant
is
sentenced
to
death.
however,
they
can
impose
leniency
and
the
statute
provides
automatically
for
a
life
imprisonment.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes,
this
kind
of
a
case,
the
judge
has
the
complete
unfettered
discretion
to
impose
any
sentence
which
he
deems
necessary
under
the
facts.
the
only
prohibition
that
is
put
upon
the
second
sentencing
judge
is
that
the
time
served
under
the
first
sentence
which
was
voided
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
has
to
be
credited
and
the
time
served
under
the
first
sentence
and
the
time
imposed
under
the
second
sentence
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
--
cannot
exceed
that
maximum
allowed
by
the
statute.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
would
be
a
flagrant
violation
of
the
man's
constitutional
right
to
appeal
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
the
constitutional
right
to
appeal
without
any
fear
of
reprisal.
and
our
supreme
court
so
held
in
a
case
called
state
versus
patton
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
--
where
the
sentencing
judge
--
yes,
first
imposed
the
fine
on
the
individual.
and
then
the
individual
gave
notice
of
appeal
and
the
sentencing
judge
thereupon
struck
his
first
sentence
of
a
fine
and
imposed
active
time.
our
supreme
court
said
that
this
was
a
flagrant
violation
of
the
man's
constitutional
right
to
appeal
without
fear
of
any
reprisal.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
think
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
educe
that
type
of
evidence
but
i
think
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
think
that
we
have
--
yes.
i
think
that
we
have
to
presume
though
since
--
as
i
see
it,
our
whole
system
is
based
upon
the
good
faith
of
judges.
we
have
to
assume
that
the
sentencing
judge
is
not
going
to
be
vindictive
and
if
he
were
vindictive,
he
could
easily
circumvent
the
rule
that
was
applied
in
patton
by
imposing
the
maximum
sentence
the
first
time
around
and
then
there
would
never
be
any
question
about
it.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
under
the
state
and
federal
constitution.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
--
that
is
not
eddie
patton
that
was
decided
by
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
it
is
a
different
patton
case.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
of
course
our
supreme
court
has
already
upheld
in
a
similar
situation
as
is
now
before
the
court
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
pearce
case
itself
that
the
second
sentencing
judge
properly
within
his
discretion
imposed
the
eight-year
sentence.
they
found
no
violation
of
the
man's
constitutional
right.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
think
the
only
indication
is
that
the
second
sentencing
judge
intended
to
impose
the
maximum,
the
15
years.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
there
is
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no,
there
is
not.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
think
it
should,
i
think
the
burden
should
be
upon
the
defendant
to
show.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
it
depends
upon
the
disparity
between
the
two
sentences
that
were
imposed.
here,
we're
talking
about
a
very
short
period
of
time.
if
the
defendant
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
yes,
that
is
true.
my
argument
would
be
that
rather
than
adopt
the
flat
prohibition
set
forth
in
patton
if
the
court
were
not
--
of
the
opinion
that
the
burden
is
on
the
defendant
to
show
abuse
that
the
position
should
be
if
any
additional
evidence
is
shown
at
the
second
trial
then
the
trial
judge
should
have
complete
discretion
in
imposing
a
harsher
sentence
upon
the
defendant
than
was
imposed
at
the
first
trial.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
if
a
new
trial
is
awarded
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
i
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
of
course
our
argument
is
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
we
must
assume
that
the
trial
judge
had
some
good
reason
in
imposing
a
harsher
sentence.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
think
definitely
he
should
give
his
reasons,
yes.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
i
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
in
a
very
recent
decision,
state
versus
stafford
which
is
cited
in
the
state's
brief
stated
that
the
burden
should
be
upon
the
defendant
to
show
abuse.
however,
it
would
be
more
orderly
if
they
--
if
there
was
evidence
or
if
the
judge
stated
his
reasons
into
the
record
as
to
why
an
increased
sentence
was
given.
the
main
contention
that
we
have
here
is
that
the
flat
prohibition
laid
down
in
the
patton
case
than
you
can
never
no
matter
what
the
evidence
is
at
the
second
trial.
you
can
never
exceed
the
sentence
imposed
at
the
first
trial.
we
think
that
that
is
a
flagrant
violation
of
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
to
impose
a
proper
sentence
and
the
discretion
of
the
state
legislature
to
fix
a
punishment
for
a
particular
crime.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
of
course,
the
defendant
is
the
one
that
has
to
request
the
new
trial,
the
state
can't
go
in
on
its
own
initiative
and
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
that
is
correct.
i'll
pay
him
to
appeal
or
try
to
get
a
new
trial
under
the
post-conviction
hearing
act.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
well,
i
believe
that
i
have
tried
to
make
my
position
clear
in
this
particular
case
that
the
second
sentencing
judge
deducted
that
gain
and
flat
time
from
the
maximum
that
he
could've
imposed
under
the
offense,
15
years
and
not
under
the
minimum
and
that
was
the
violation
which
the
district
court
and
the
fourth
circuit
court
found
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
it
would
seem
that
the
record
does
show
that
justice
black.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
second
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina,
the
supreme
court
so
stated
that
in
their
fact
--
situation
that
the
evidence
was
essentially
the
same.
of
course,
there
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
i
believe
it
was
a
different
judge,
i
think
the
record
would
show
that.
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
no,
i
mean
--
as
i
recall
i
am
fairly
sure
that
the
judge
--
mr.
andrew
a.
vanore,
jr.
if
this
court
has
any
further
questions?
