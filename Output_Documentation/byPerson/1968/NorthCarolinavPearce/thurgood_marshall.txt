justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
vanore,
is
this
man
been
out
on
bail
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
did
he
get
out
on
bail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
except
for
that
six
months,
he's
been
out
on
bail
but
for
this
new
trial
he'd
be
out
for
good.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
had
seven-years
from
today?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yeah.
so,
he
would
just
about
be
out
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
solely
because
he
made
a
mistake
of
going
to
the
court
and
solely
because
the
mistake
the
court
gave
in
giving
him
a
new
trial,
he's
got
to
serve
more
time,
isn't
that
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
i
mean
--
speaking
for
the
man,
i
imagine
a
very
great
difficulty
in
seeing
anything
other
than
fact
he's
got
to
serve
more
time
solely
because
he
was
given
a
new
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn't
he
have
a
little
reason
to
feel
that
way?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
vanore,
did
i
--
isn't
that
true
that
in
north
carolina
once
a
sentence
is
given,
this
final
judgment,
the
judge
can
never
increase
that,
can
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
if
there
is
an
appeal
that
comes
back
to
him,
he
can
increase
it,
is
that
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
happens
to
all
of
this
judicial
faith
and
the
judging
of?
he
couldn't
do
it,
wouldn't
he
be
obliged
to
show
why
on
the
second
go
around
he
gave
more?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
he
can't
give
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
that's
the
only
way
he
can
give
more.
that's
the
only
way
he
can
give
more
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
wouldn't
it
be
better
if
he'd
give
his
reasons?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
--
but
i
thought
you
said
that
the
defendant
should
be
given
the
burden
of
showing
it
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
he
doesn't
want
this
burden,
does
he?
you
agree
with
me
that
the
judge
has
got
a
little
burden?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
i'm
saying
is,
if
a
man
committed
a
crime
and
he's
sentenced
to
five
to
15
years
and
after
that
time
the
judge
finds
out
from
reputable
sources
that
this
is
about
his
horrible
character
has
ever
came
down
the
line,
one.
two,
if
i
had
that
information
whether
it
was
before
me
i
would've
given
him
15
years.
there's
nothing
he
can
do
about
it
unless
there's
a
new
trial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
there's
a
new
trial
then
he
gets
15
years?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
the
only
way
this
man
can
get
(inaudible).
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
states
as
i
could
be
rectified
by
giving
him
the
maximum
every
time.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
i
understood
it
to
say
it
should.
he
wasn't
recommending
it
but
he
said
that
would
be
a
way
you
do
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
trial
of
both
cases,
i
was
wrong.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
i
understand
here
that
under
alabama
law;
before
the
writ
of
coram
nobis
was
reinstated
there
was
no
way
of
bringing
this
point
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
where
do
you
get
the
equal
protection
argument
of
the
wealthy
man,
he
couldn't
bring
it
up
either,
could
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
happens
to
equal
protection
argument
on
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
vanore,
is
this
man
been
out
on
bail
at
all?
justice
thurgood

when
did
