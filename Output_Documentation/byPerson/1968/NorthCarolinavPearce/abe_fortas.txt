justice
abe
fortas
let's
--
that
--
there's
a
factor
in
this
case
that
bothers
me,
if
the
sentence
said
the
first
time
around
on
the
first
conviction
was
--
what
was
it,
12
to
15
years?
justice
abe
fortas
ten
to
12,
something
like
that
and
second
time
around
there
was
eight
years,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
do
i
understand
that
it's
the
rule
in
north
carolina
that
you
do
give
prisoners
on
their
second
conviction
credit
for
time
served?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
rule
of
law?
justice
abe
fortas
does
that
include
gain
time?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
so
when
this
fellow
was
given
eight-year
sentence
in
the
second
trial
if
he
had
served
the
whole
eight-year
without
any
reference
to
additional
gain
time,
he
would've
had
to
serve
another
one
year
and
five
months?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
the
sentence
here
was
not
eight
years
but
15
years?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
he
got
eight
years?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
if
he
had
been
given
credit
for
the
time
served
under
the
first
sentence
including
plus
gain
time,
he
would've
had
only
as
i
said
before,
you
had
only
another
--
what
was
it,
year
and
five
months
served?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
he
would
be,
wouldn't
he?
no,
no,
no,
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
i
don't
mean
that.
i
don't
mean
he
wouldn't
be.
no,
i
don't
mean
that
he
would
be
but
i
mean
to
say
it
already
passed
a
sentence
and
the
sentence
was
eight
years,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
not
15
years
but
eight
years?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
does
the
north
carolina
law
rule
that
you've
just
recited
with
respect
to
giving
him
credit
the
time
served
plus
gain
time
applied
to
that
eight-year
sentence?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
i've
struggled
with
this
on
the
basis
of
the
briefs
and
i'm
still
bewildered
because
if
i
--
just
looking
at
this
thing
literally
this
follows
to
you
to
be
sprung
about
now.
justice
abe
fortas
isn't
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
yes.
justice
abe
fortas
i
know
but
my
problem
here
is
this
in
truth
and
in
fact
a
case
--
does
this
case
really
present
a
situation
in
which
the
second
sentence
was
greater
than
the
first
sentence.
justice
abe
fortas
12-year
sentence?
now,
when
would
he
be
entitled
to
get
out
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
including
maximum
gain
time
which
is
fuller
--
seems
steadily
govern?
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now,
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
bound
to
be
less,
that's
bound
to
be
less
on
the
time
he's
got
to
serve
under
his
second
sentence?
justice
abe
fortas
not
because
of
--
well,
you
--
i
--
this
is
much
to
elaborate.
i
computed
this
yesterday
on
the
basis
of
the
briefs
and
i
have
very
serious
question
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
we
are
in
truth
and
in
fact
here
faced
with
a
situation
in
which
the
man
would
serve
longer
under
the
second
sentence
than
to
the
second
conviction
and
under
the
first
conviction
and
--
justice
abe
fortas
district
court
thought
so
justice
abe
fortas
--
but
apparently
the
district
court
had
an
idea
that
what
had
happen
here
was
a
15-year
sentence
but
it
wasn't,
it
was
an
eight-year
sentence
on
the
second
conviction.
justice
abe
fortas
i
beg
your
pardon.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
if
i
may,
the
appendix
on
page
3
sets
forth
the
district
judge
--
the
district
court's
statement
when
it
sentenced
the
man
and
regardless
--
i
think
it
could've
been
stated
perhaps
a
bit
more
precisely
but
it
appears
from
that
what
he
really
did
was
to
sentence
the
man
to
time
served
plus
gain
time
plus
eight
years
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
is
that
right?
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
but
that's
what
it
amounted
to
as
you
see
it
and
as
your
adversary
sees
it,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
the
difficulty.
that's
right
but
the
difficulty
is
he
didn't
say
that
but
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
in
effect
that's
why
the
two
of
you
construe.
justice
abe
fortas
may
i
--
justice
abe
fortas
have
you
considered
what
the
effect
of
this
doctrine
would
be
in
california
under
the
adult
authority
(inaudible)?
justice
abe
fortas
i
suppose
the
state
procedure,
state
law
has
provided
that
the
court
merely
sentences
the
convicted
defendant
let's
say
to
one
year
to
life
and
then
there
is
an
adult
authority
that
determines
how
long
he
shall
serve,
makes
that
determination
and
re-determination
from
time
to
time
within
that
very
broad
charter
and
i
take
some
appeal
conviction
reversed
to
retry,
again,
sentenced
one
year
to
life
and
with
the
doctrine
that
you
for
what
you
contend
have
to
be
binding
upon
the
administrative
agency
that
has
said
the
adult
authority
in
the
respect
that
they
could
not
thereafter
compel
a
man
to
serve
more
time
the
last
time
they
have
fixed
prior
his
appeal.
would
you
carry
out
that
fine,
in
other
words?
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
except
that
i'm
suggesting
that
maybe
the
principle
for
which
you
contend
would
operate
to
restrict
the
discretionary
power
of
the
adult
authority
in
the
sense
that
after
a
successful
appeal
and
reconviction
i
don't
know
why
he's
asking
whether
in
that
case
after
a
successful
appeal
and
conviction
on
the
second
trial
you
would
say
that
this
principle
should
apply
to
the
administrative
authority
namely
that
they
can't
keep
it
following
custody
any
longer
than
the
last
ruling
prior
to
his
appeal
provided.
justice
abe
fortas
i'm
not
suggesting
that
would
be
the
result
but
i
am
suggesting
that
that
is
a
problem.
justice
abe
fortas
it
might
be
raise
--
it
might
follow
as
a
consequence
of
the
doctrine
for
which
you
are
here
arguing.
justice
abe
fortas
let's
--
that
--
there's
a
factor
in
this
case
that
bothers
me,
if
the
sentence
said
the
first
time
around
on
the
first
conviction
was
--
what
was
it,
12
to
15
years?
justice
abe
fortas
ten
to
12,
something
like
that
and
second
time
around
there
was
eight
years,
right?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
do
i
understand
that
it's
the
rule
in
north
carolina
that
you
do
give
prisoners
on
their
second
conviction
credit
for
time
served?
justice
abe
fortas
that's
the
rule
of
law?
justice
abe
fortas
does
that
include
gain
time?
justice
abe
fortas
so
that
the
--
justice
abe
fortas
yes,
so
when
this
fellow
was
given
eight-year
sentence
in
the
second
trial
if
he
had
served
the
whole
eight-year
without
any
reference
to
additional
gain
time,
he
would've
had
to
serve
another
one
year
and
five
months?
justice
abe
fortas
you
mean
the
sentence
here
was
not
eight
years
but
15
years?
justice
abe
fortas
so,
he
got
eight
years?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
if
he
had
been
given
credit
for
the
time
served
under
the
first
sentence
including
plus
gain
time,
he
would've
had
only
as
i
said
before,
you
had
only
another
--
what
was
it,
year
and
five
months
served?
justice
abe
fortas
well,
he
would
be,
wouldn't
he?
no,
no,
no,
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
i
don't
mean
that.
i
don't
mean
he
wouldn't
be.
no,
i
don't
mean
that
he
would
be
but
i
mean
to
say
it
already
passed
a
sentence
and
the
sentence
was
eight
years,
is
that
right?
justice
abe
fortas
not
15
years
but
eight
years?
justice
abe
fortas
now,
does
the
north
carolina
law
rule
that
you've
just
recited
with
respect
to
giving
him
credit
the
time
served
plus

fortas
--
including
maximum
gain

which
is

justice
abe
fortas
alright.
now,
that's
--
justice
abe
fortas
--
bound
to
be
less,
that's
bound
to
be
less
on
the
time
he's
got
to

under

not
