mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
paul
gish,
assistant
attorney
general
of
alabama
representing
warden
simpson
as
the
petitioner
in
the
case
of
simpson
against
rice.
in
this
case,
mr.
rice
was
convicted
in
1960
of
four
separate
cases
of
second-degree
burglary.
it
was
seen
on
a
plea
of
guilty
in
each
case
four
years
in
one
case
and
two
years
in
each
of
the
other
three
cases,
making
a
total
of
ten.
his
plea
of
guilty
was
entered
without
aid
of
counsel
to
a
post-conviction
remedy.
he
received
a
new
trial
some
two-and-a-half
years
later.
our
counsel
was
appointed
for
a
new
trial
and
he
was
tried
i
believe
in
december
1964,
i
think
that's
where
i'm
in,
in
two
of
the
cases.
he
was
convicted
by
a
jury,
a
second
judge
who
passed
an
earlier
sentence,
gave
him
10
years
on
each
of
those
two
convictions.
the
next
part
in
making
a
--
took
rule
20.
the
next
point,
he
was
tried
on
a
third
case,
(inaudible)
case
was
convicted
by
a
jury
and
the
same
judge
sentenced
him
to
five
years
imprisonment
and
this
time,
the
time
of
the
last
trial,
the
state
prosecuting
officer
with
a
motion
to
nisi
prius
for
us
before
the
case
and
that
is
what
the
trial
did,
fourth
case
was
now
before
us.
now,
this
case
if
the
court
please
is
similar
of
course
to
the
north
carolina
v.
pearce
case.
however,
those
who
are
summoned
caucasians
over
argued
by
counsel
that
we
don't
have
here.
of
course,
this
man
did
receive
harsher
punishment.
he
received
much
harsher
punishment
on
the
second
trial
than
he
did
on
the
first.
he's
not
only
did
that
but
your
honor
i'm
searching
for
word
technically
at
least
he
received
no
credit
for
the
two-and-a-half
years
served
between
the
first
convictions
and
his
post
convictions
remedy.
now,
our
position
is
that
the
trial
did
as
complete
discretion
to
our
sentence
after
a
judgment
of
guilt
having
that
complete
discretion
he
uses
many
factors,
some
of
which
are
connected
with
the
crime
itself.
some
of
which
may
be
connected
with
the
man,
some
of
which
are
--
can
be
connected
with
the
issue
of
the
case
itself,
some
of
which
if
the
court
please
depends
upon
how
much
the
trial
judge
knows
about
this
particular
case
at
this
time.
in
other
words,
on
a
plea
of
guilty,
i
have
seen
in
the
record
that
showed
here
what
i've
seen
in
years
of
good
experience
that
all
of
the
current
cases
in
which
the,
i
believe
until
may
were
doing
the
prosecuting
officer
and
the
accused
that
we
will
go
--
entertain
a
plea
of
guilty
if
all
of
those
that
i
have
ever
seen
(inaudible)
that
would
not
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
of
course
mr.
chief
justice
i
must
agree
with
--
i
must
agree
with
you.
some
judges
i'm
sure
would
do
that
but
our
position
is
that
the
judge
who
is
an
elected
or
appointed
official
who
in
alabama
does
not
say
and
does
not
have
any
way
of
prescribed
violation
cited
by
the
courts
but
why
i've
given
you
more
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
i
don't
feel
that
he
could,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
i
don't
--
your
honor,
if
i
disagree
with
you
that
he
couldn't
i
think
that
if
there
are
second
chances
that
we
don't
know
about.
we
have
vindication
now.
vindictiveness
could
be
shown
then
we
would
have
the
case
where
a
man
could
show
that
my
rights
are
vindictive
judge
who
did
this
just
punish
me.
but
what
i'm
saying
my
position
is
that
the
mere
fact
that
he
receives
--
that
the
accused
receives
a
harsher
punishment
and
in
this
case
in
my
judgment
can
be
and
should
be
contributed
as
much
to
other
sentencing
factors
and
not
to
give
vindictiveness.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
i
agree
with
every
part
of
your
question
except
when
your
honor
states
that
it's
the
same
evidence,
now
i
think
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
on
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
on
a
plea
of
guilty
as
this
man
even
the
first
in
a
crime
of
this
sort.
in
many
times,
no
evidence
in
our
own
is
presented
to
the
court.
now,
we
don't
know
from
this
record
whether
the
judge
had
any
evidence
but
we
do
know
that
the
judge
has
the
evidence
on
the
jury
trial.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
that's
right.
now,
my
time
is
over,
i
shall
ought
in
this
case
i
can't
argue
all
about
our
contentions.
let
me
point
to
a
few
things
that
are
not
in
the
brief.
in
the
goolsby
cases
in
which
i
have
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief
on
the
merits
and
which
was
not
reported
throughout
our
brief,
they've
sentenced
appropriate
in
215
seventh
circuit
598
and
602.
now,
those
cases
does
need
subsequent
to
the
second
conviction
in
this
case
of
in
essence
that
a
man
in
alabama
cannot
receive
more
punishment
for
one
crime
than
the
maximum
provided
by
statute.
now,
that
is
all
that
alabama
requires
and
frankly
that
is
no
way
that
i
know
of
to
give
a
man
credit
in
alabama
on
his
prior
conviction
of
the
second
case.
the
legislature
does
not
leave
it
to
the
present
authorities
receive
a
man
with
the
judgment
and
sentence
of
the
court.
the
present
authorities
have
no
discretion
as
to
what
to
do
with
this
man
except
to
receive
him
and
let
him
serve
his
term
under
the
roof.
now
we
do
have
“good
time”
and
there
are
two
types
of
good
time
which
is
the
same
as
“gain
time”
of
north
carolina.
those
things
are
figured
by
the
present
authorities.
now,
if
i
may,
let
me
get
to
the
records
in
this
case
in
the
appendix
on
pages
55
and
56,
we
have
as
an
exhibit
to
add
if
that's
alright
with
this
court,
a
statement
by
the
prosecutor
as
to
how
he
handles
the
second
cases
on
retrial.
now,
frankly
i
do
not
understand
the
statement
of
the
district
court
that
flatly
a
key
to
the
sta
staf
alabama
of
increasing
punishment,
increasing
sentences
merely
for
punishment
that
in
no
evidence
that
i
see
in
these
records
except
the
statement
on
which
55
and
56
and
the
statement
by
the
petitioner
below
that
he
didn't
know
why
he
served
or
why
he
had
to
serve
the
sentence.
now,
of
course
i
don't
think
that
any
convicted
man
could
say
why
the
judge
gave
him
the
maximum
instead
of
the
minimum
is
somewhat
intriguing.
this
court
i
think
can
never
held
that
this
type
of
situation
is
similar-type
situation
involve
double
jeopardy.
the
court
has
held
in
alabama
from
the
beginning
had
also
held
that
if
a
man
is
convicted
of
a
lesser
offense,
he'd
automatically
acquitted
of
a
higher
offense.
in
other
words,
if
he
were
convicted
of
second-degree
murder
he
cannot
again
be
tried
and
convicted
of
first-degree
murder
but
we
should
admit
the
difference
between
that
situation
and
being
convicted
of
first-degree
murder
for
ten
years
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
second
trial
being
convicted
and
getting
a
life
of
the
same
degree
of
crime.
there
is
a
case
that's
cited
by
the
circuit
court
of
fifth
circuit
reported
on
403
f.2d
1019.
this
is
not
cited
in
any
of
the
briefs
filed
here
before
filed
in
this
case.
frankly,
i
do
not
--
i
cannot
from
a
constitutional
standpoint
understand
this
case
to
williams
against
state
of
alabama,
this
case
in
connection
with
the
case
before
this
court.
in
the
williams
case,
there
were
three
convictions
on
first
trial.
each
sentence
was
for
five
years.
on
the
second
trial,
mr.
williams
was
convicted
by
the
jury
and
given
ten
years
in
one
case.
in
the
other
two
cases,
he
was
given
a
year
and
a
half
which
put
him
of
course
in
a
better
position,
the
second
time
he
was
than
in
the
first
time.
and
i
can
tell
you
that
he's
in
a
better
position.
i
have
constitutionally
if
mr.
rice
was
entitled
to
receive
only
what
he
did
the
first
time
with
credit
for
time
served
and
the
district
court
held
then
constitutionally
why
wasn't
mr.
williams
entitled
of
the
same
treatment
except
that
on
the
whole
mr.
williams
got
a
better
deal
at
the
cases
than
mr.
rice
did.
to
me
at
a
constitutional
point,
i
do
not
understand
that
as
a
form
of
morality
as
a
point
of
what
should
be
known
in
a
particular
case,
i
can't
understand
it
but
in
the
constitutional
point,
if
mr.
rice
has
in
the
end
of
his
year
with
no
addition,
then
i
submit
that
mr.
williams
is
entitled
of
the
same
thing.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
if
the
court
please.
mr.
justice
brennan's
view
accused
in
this
case
received
on
the
second
trial,
he
doesn't
(inaudible)
the
ideas.
he
has
the
maximum
sentence
on
three
indictments
for
burglary
in
second
degree
is
30
years.
i
do
not
think
we
have
any
question
here
that
this
man
has
received
what
was
more
than
the
maximum
allowed
by
the
alabama
statute.
when
he
was
on
his
first
1960
convictions,
he
received
10
years
out
of
a
maximum
total
of
40.
on
the
second
trial,
he
received
25
years
out
of
a
maximum
total
of
30.
so
we
have
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
two
and
a
half
years.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
which
was
still
less.
it
would
27
and
a
half
years.
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
no,
sir
not
in
my
state.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
it
may
have
been
in
this
county.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
the
petitioner
has
said
before
at
the
evidentiary
hearing.
i
do
not
know
if
it's
correct
or
not
that
is
a
test
before.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
know.
i
know
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
that
may
be
so
mr.
justice
stewart.
let
me
say
this.
i
do
not
fully
understand
judge
johnson's
opinion
in
two
or
three
respects.
and
this
isn't
forum,
he
says
they
either
not
know
in
the
first
place
that
the
state
cannot
give
a
harsher
sentence.
alright,
then
he
says
that
where
the
state
does
not
show
by
the
record
“the
reason
for
your
harsher
sentence
been
a
due
process
or
equal
protection
overtly.
then
i
am
wondering
was
my
hindsight
has
always
been
a
lot
better
foresight
but
i
guess
it
does,
what
if
i
had
at
the
time
of
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
introduced
the
evidence
in
front
of
the
judge
and
the
prosecutor
to
let
them
explain
why
this
was
(inaudible).
as
i
read
--
as
i
read
judge
johnson's
opinion
even
that
were
not
have
had
my
cause
at
that
state
of
the
game
and
i
read
the
opinion
and
he
said
in
the
record
and
offered
them
the
record
on
the
second
trial
might
show
some
reasons.
well,
i
couldn't
conceive
of
no
reason
other
than
the
fact
as
i
said
it
earlier
that
the
judge
had
the
evidence
before
him
the
second
tim
and
he
accepted
the
plea
of
guilty
on
the
first
trial.
now,
would
it
be
enough
for
the
trial
judge
in
stating
the
record
at
the
end
of
the
trial
when
jury
convicts.
well,
this
time,
i
read
the
evidence
against
you.
the
first
time,
you
and
the
prosecutor
entered
to
an
agreement
and
i
ratified
it
by
accepting
your
plea
but
this
time,
no
more
advantage.
so
therefore,
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
harsher
sentence.
now,
would
that
be
enough?
i
don't
know
what
this
opinion.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
no,
i
think
they
based
that
on
to
that
note
--
i
have
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
now,
this
instance
confronted
me
sir
and
seriously
i
know
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
this
case
and
in
related
cases,
it
bound
to
have
a
tremendous
effect
upon
the
sentencing
policies
of
the
trial
judges
all
over
the
country.
i
am
sure
talking
with
such
judges
in
that
thing
of
course
each
individual,
they
got
to
be
when
someone
have
a
policy
on
plead
of
guilty
or
being
lenient
and
frankly
i'm
not
looking
too
closely
to
case
other
than
of
course
the
no
harder
than
from
the
beginning
but
if
the
state
cannot
make
its
bargain
in
the
one
instance
and
repudiated
at
the
same
time,
accuse
to
repudiate
then
the
sentencing
policies
of
the
trial
judges
in
the
land
will
change
many
of
them.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
saying
what?
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes,
they
have
gotten
to
the
bargain.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
on
agreement.
yes,
sir.
i've
seen
it
happen
many,
many
times
to
a
person
to
us.
what?
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
judge
harris
and
powell
and
partly
johnny.
now,
i
don't
want
you
to
understand
me
sir.
i
did
not
say,
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
that
they
had
any
motive
of
a
bargain
and
we
would
make
it
buying
and
selling
of
property.
i
meant
--
i
meant
merely
this
that
the
agreement
and
i
call
it
a
bargain
would
be
if
you
leave
out
the
fact
of
no
attorney
the
defense
attorney
would
ask
the
prosecutor
how
much
sentence
can
we
have
if
we
plead
guilty
and
then
maybe
bargaining
in
this
instance
that
there
might
be
some
little
time
before
an
agreement
is
reached.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
i'm
not
apologizing.
i'm
just
trying
to
be
shoot
with
this.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
right.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
if
the
court
please,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
paul
gish,
assistant
attorney
general
of
alabama
representing
warden
simpson
as
the
petitioner
in
the
case
of
simpson
against
rice.
in
this
case,
mr.
rice
was
convicted
in
1960
of
four
separate
cases
of
second-degree
burglary.
it
was
seen
on
a
plea
of
guilty
in
each
case
four
years
in
one
case
and
two
years
in
each
of
the
other
three
cases,
making
a
total
of
ten.
his
plea
of
guilty
was
entered
without
aid
of
counsel
to
a
post-conviction
remedy.
he
received
a
new
trial
some
two-and-a-half
years
later.
our
counsel
was
appointed
for
a
new
trial
and
he
was
tried
i
believe
in
december
1964,
i
think
that's
where
i'm
in,
in
two
of
the
cases.
he
was
convicted
by
a
jury,
a
second
judge
who
passed
an
earlier
sentence,
gave
him
10
years
on
each
of
those
two
convictions.
the
next
part
in
making
a
--
took
rule
20.
the
next
point,
he
was
tried
on
a
third
case,
(inaudible)
case
was
convicted
by
a
jury
and
the
same
judge
sentenced
him
to
five
years
imprisonment
and
this
time,
the
time
of
the
last
trial,
the
state
prosecuting
officer
with
a
motion
to
nisi
prius
for
us
before
the
case
and
that
is
what
the
trial
did,
fourth
case
was
now
before
us.
now,
this
case
if
the
court
please
is
similar
of
course
to
the
north
carolina
v.
pearce
case.
however,
those
who
are
summoned
caucasians
over
argued
by
counsel
that
we
don't
have
here.
of
course,
this
man
did
receive
harsher
punishment.
he
received
much
harsher
punishment
on
the
second
trial
than
he
did
on
the
first.
he's
not
only
did
that
but
your
honor
i'm
searching
for
word
technically
at
least
he
received
no
credit
for
the
two-and-a-half
years
served
between
the
first
convictions
and
his
post
convictions
remedy.
now,
our
position
is
that
the
trial
did
as
complete
discretion
to
our
sentence
after
a
judgment
of
guilt
having
that
complete
discretion
he
uses
many
factors,
some
of
which
are
connected
with
the
crime
itself.
some
of
which
may
be
connected
with
the
man,
some
of
which
are
--
can
be
connected
with
the
issue
of
the
case
itself,
some
of
which
if
the
court
please
depends
upon
how
much
the
trial
judge
knows
about
this
particular
case
at
this
time.
in
other
words,
on
a
plea
of
guilty,
i
have
seen
in
the
record
that
showed
here
what
i've
seen
in
years
of
good
experience
that
all
of
the
current
cases
in
which
the,
i
believe
until
may
were
doing
the
prosecuting
officer
and
the
accused
that
we
will
go
--
entertain
a
plea
of
guilty
if
all
of
those
that
i
have
ever
seen
(inaudible)
that
would
not
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
of
course
mr.
chief
justice
i
must
agree
with
--
i
must
agree
with
you.
some
judges
i'm
sure
would
do
that
but
our
position
is
that
the
judge
who
is
an
elected
or
appointed
official
who
in
alabama
does
not
say
and
does
not
have
any
way
of
prescribed
violation
cited
by
the
courts
but
why
i've
given
you
more
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
i
don't
feel
that
he
could,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
i
don't
--
your
honor,
if
i
disagree
with
you
that
he
couldn't
i
think
that
if
there
are
second
chances
that
we
don't
know
about.
we
have
vindication
now.
vindictiveness
could
be
shown
then
we
would
have
the
case
where
a
man
could
show
that
my
rights
are
vindictive
judge
who
did
this
just
punish
me.
but
what
i'm
saying
my
position
is
that
the
mere
fact
that
he
receives
--
that
the
accused
receives
a
harsher
punishment
and
in
this
case
in
my
judgment
can
be
and
should
be
contributed
as
much
to
other
sentencing
factors
and
not
to
give
vindictiveness.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
i
agree
with
every
part
of
your
question
except
when
your
honor
states
that
it's
the
same
evidence,
now
i
think
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
on
a
plea
of
guilty.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
on
a
plea
of
guilty
as
this
man
even
the
first
in
a
crime
of
this
sort.
in
many
times,
no
evidence
in
our
own
is
presented
to
the
court.
now,
we
don't
know
from
this
record
whether
the
judge
had
any
evidence
but
we
do
know
that
the
judge
has
the
evidence
on
the
jury
trial.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
that's
right.
now,
my
time
is
over,
i
shall
ought
in
this
case
i
can't
argue
all
about
our
contentions.
let
me
point
to
a
few
things
that
are
not
in
the
brief.
in
the
goolsby
cases
in
which
i
have
in
the
appendix
to
my
brief
on
the
merits
and
which
was
not
reported
throughout
our
brief,
they've
sentenced
appropriate
in
215
seventh
circuit
598
and
602.
now,
those
cases
does
need
subsequent
to
the
second
conviction
in
this
case
of
in
essence
that
a
man
in
alabama
cannot
receive
more
punishment
for
one
crime
than
the
maximum
provided
by
statute.
now,
that
is
all
that
alabama
requires
and
frankly
that
is
no
way
that
i
know
of
to
give
a
man
credit
in
alabama
on
his
prior
conviction
of
the
second
case.
the
legislature
does
not
leave
it
to
the
present
authorities
receive
a
man
with
the
judgment
and
sentence
of
the
court.
the
present
authorities
have
no
discretion
as
to
what
to
do
with
this
man
except
to
receive
him
and
let
him
serve
his
term
under
the
roof.
now
we
do
have
“good
time”
and
there
are
two
types
of
good
time
which
is
the
same
as
“gain
time”
of
north
carolina.
those
things
are
figured
by
the
present
authorities.
now,
if
i
may,
let
me
get
to
the
records
in
this
case
in
the
appendix
on
pages
55
and
56,
we
have
as
an
exhibit
to
add
if
that's
alright
with
this
court,
a
statement
by
the
prosecutor
as
to
how
he
handles
the
second
cases
on
retrial.
now,
frankly
i
do
not
understand
the
statement
of
the
district
court
that
flatly
a
key
to
the
sta
staf
alabama
of
increasing
punishment,
increasing
sentences
merely
for
punishment
that
in
no
evidence
that
i
see
in
these
records
except
the
statement
on
which
55
and
56
and
the
statement
by
the
petitioner
below
that
he
didn't
know
why
he
served
or
why
he
had
to
serve
the
sentence.
now,
of
course
i
don't
think
that
any
convicted
man
could
say
why
the
judge
gave
him
the
maximum
instead
of
the
minimum
is
somewhat
intriguing.
this
court
i
think
can
never
held
that
this
type
of
situation
is
similar-type
situation
involve
double
jeopardy.
the
court
has
held
in
alabama
from
the
beginning
had
also
held
that
if
a
man
is
convicted
of
a
lesser
offense,
he'd
automatically
acquitted
of
a
higher
offense.
in
other
words,
if
he
were
convicted
of
second-degree
murder
he
cannot
again
be
tried
and
convicted
of
first-degree
murder
but
we
should
admit
the
difference
between
that
situation
and
being
convicted
of
first-degree
murder
for
ten
years
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
second
trial
being
convicted
and
getting
a
life
of
the
same
degree
of
crime.
there
is
a
case
that's
cited
by
the
circuit
court
of
fifth
circuit
reported
on
403
f.2d
1019.
this
is
not
cited
in
any
of
the
briefs
filed
here
before
filed
in
this
case.
frankly,
i
do
not
--
i
cannot
from
a
constitutional
standpoint
understand
this
case
to
williams
against
state
of
alabama,
this
case
in
connection
with
the
case
before
this
court.
in
the
williams
case,
there
were
three
convictions
on
first
trial.
each
sentence
was
for
five
years.
on
the
second
trial,
mr.
williams
was
convicted
by
the
jury
and
given
ten
years
in
one
case.
in
the
other
two
cases,
he
was
given
a
year
and
a
half
which
put
him
of
course
in
a
better
position,
the
second
time
he
was
than
in
the
first
time.
and
i
can
tell
you
that
he's
in
a
better
position.
i
have
constitutionally
if
mr.
rice
was
entitled
to
receive
only
what
he
did
the
first
time
with
credit
for
time
served
and
the
district
court
held
then
constitutionally
why
wasn't
mr.
williams
entitled
of
the
same
treatment
except
that
on
the
whole
mr.
williams
got
a
better
deal
at
the
cases
than
mr.
rice
did.
to
me
at
a
constitutional
point,
i
do
not
understand
that
as
a
form
of
morality
as
a
point
of
what
should
be
known
in
a
particular
case,
i
can't
understand
it
but
in
the
constitutional
point,
if
mr.
rice
has
in
the
end
of
his
year
with
no
addition,
then
i
submit
that
mr.
williams
is
entitled
of
the
same
thing.
thank
you.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
if
the
court
please.
mr.
justice
brennan's
view
accused
in
this
case
received
on
the
second
trial,
he
doesn't
(inaudible)
the
ideas.
he
has
the
maximum
sentence
on
three
indictments
for
burglary
in
second
degree
is
30
years.
i
do
not
think
we
have
any
question
here
that
this
man
has
received
what
was
more
than
the
maximum
allowed
by
the
alabama
statute.
when
he
was
on
his
first
1960
convictions,
he
received
10
years
out
of
a
maximum
total
of
40.
on
the
second
trial,
he
received
25
years
out
of
a
maximum
total
of
30.
so
we
have
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
two
and
a
half
years.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
which
was
still
less.
it
would
27
and
a
half
years.
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
no,
sir
not
in
my
state.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
it
may
have
been
in
this
county.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
the
petitioner
has
said
before
at
the
evidentiary
hearing.
i
do
not
know
if
it's
correct
or
not
that
is
a
test
before.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
know.
i
know
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
that
may
be
so
mr.
justice
stewart.
let
me
say
this.
i
do
not
fully
understand
judge
johnson's
opinion
in
two
or
three
respects.
and
this
isn't
forum,
he
says
they
either
not
know
in
the
first
place
that
the
state
cannot
give
a
harsher
sentence.
alright,
then
he
says
that
where
the
state
does
not
show
by
the
record
“the
reason
for
your
harsher
sentence
been
a
due
process
or
equal
protection
overtly.
then
i
am
wondering
was
my
hindsight
has
always
been
a
lot
better
foresight
but
i
guess
it
does,
what
if
i
had
at
the
time
of
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
introduced
the
evidence
in
front
of
the
judge
and
the
prosecutor
to
let
them
explain
why
this
was
(inaudible).
as
i
read
--
as
i
read
judge
johnson's
opinion
even
that
were
not
have
had
my
cause
at
that
state
of
the
game
and
i
read
the
opinion
and
he
said
in
the
record
and
offered
them
the
record
on
the
second
trial
might
show
some
reasons.
well,
i
couldn't
conceive
of
no
reason
other
than
the
fact
as
i
said
it
earlier
that
the
judge
had
the
evidence
before
him
the
second
tim
and
he
accepted
the
plea
of
guilty
on
the
first
trial.
now,
would
it
be
enough
for
the
trial
judge
in
stating
the
record
at
the
end
of
the
trial
when
jury
convicts.
well,
this
time,
i
read
the
evidence
against
you.
the
first
time,
you
and
the
prosecutor
entered
to
an
agreement
and
i
ratified
it
by
accepting
your
plea
but
this
time,
no
more
advantage.
so
therefore,
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
harsher
sentence.
now,
would
that
be
enough?
i
don't
know
what
this
opinion.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
no,
i
think
they
based
that
on
to
that
note
--
i
have
--
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
now,
this
instance
confronted
me
sir
and
seriously
i
know
that
the
decision
of
this
court
in
this
case
and
in
related
cases,
it
bound
to
have
a
tremendous
effect
upon
the
sentencing
policies
of
the
trial
judges
all
over
the
country.
i
am
sure
talking
with
such
judges
in
that
thing
of
course
each
individual,
they
got
to
be
when
someone
have
a
policy
on
plead
of
guilty
or
being
lenient
and
frankly
i'm
not
looking
too
closely
to
case
other
than
of
course
the
no
harder
than
from
the
beginning
but
if
the
state
cannot
make
its
bargain
in
the
one
instance
and
repudiated
at
the
same
time,
accuse
to
repudiate
then
the
sentencing
policies
of
the
trial
judges
in
the
land
will
change
many
of
them.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
saying
what?
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
yes,
they
have
gotten
to
the
bargain.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
on
agreement.
yes,
sir.
i've
seen
it
happen
many,
many
times
to
a
person
to
us.
what?
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
judge
harris
and
powell
and
partly
johnny.
now,
i
don't
want
you
to
understand
me
sir.
i
did
not
say,
i
did
not
mean
to
imply
that
they
had
any
motive
of
a
bargain
and
we
would
make
it
buying
and
selling
of
property.
i
meant
--
i
meant
merely
this
that
the
agreement
and
i
call
it
a
bargain
would
be
if
you
leave
out
the
fact
of
no
attorney
the
defense
attorney
would
ask
the
prosecutor
how
much
sentence
can
we
have
if
we
plead
guilty
and
then
maybe
bargaining
in
this
instance
that
there
might
be
some
little
time
before
an
agreement
is
reached.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
i'm
not
apologizing.
i'm
just
trying
to
be
shoot
with
this.
mr.
paul
t.
gish,
jr.
right.
thank
you
very
much.
