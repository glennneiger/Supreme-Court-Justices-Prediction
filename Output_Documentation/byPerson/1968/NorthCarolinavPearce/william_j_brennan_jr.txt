justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
stroud,
you
say
only
turn
really
on
the
old
law
that,
perhaps
still
law,
that
a
second
trial
after
a
successful
appeal
is
not
in
and
out
of
itself
a
violation
of
double
jeopardy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
your
argument
had
been
made
in
stroud,
do
you
suppose
that
stroud
would
have
been
more
--
anymore
successful
than
in
green?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
--
at
that
time,
clearly
double
jeopardy
--
there's
no
suggestion
of
double
jeopardy
by
the
state,
wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
wasn't
that
kansas?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
lawson,
may
i
just
get
myself
oriented?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
understand
that
this
offense,
second-degree
burglary
carries
a
maximum
of
ten
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
there
have
been
only
just
one
count
to
which
had
been
a
guilty
plea
and
there
had
been
a
sentence
of
ten
years,
that
the
denial
of
assistance
to
counsel
didn't
come
to
light
until
after
he
had
served
say
eight
years
or
ten
years,
if
he
could
have
served
that
long,
could
he
--
could
he
have
served
that
long?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
take
six
years.
just
before
he
had
served
these
six
years,
then
he
succeeds
in
getting
the
conviction
set
aside
for
denial
of
assistance
of
counsel
and
he
goes
to
trial.
now,
do
i
understand
that
on
conviction,
on
trial,
he
could
get
another
ten-year
sentence
that
he
would
have
serve
that
six
years
if
it's
a
good
time
produced
to
six
years
so
that
the
aggregate
would
be
say
12
years
on
what
for
the
offenses
on
the
maximum
of
ten
years
under
the
statute,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
at
the
time
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
--
then
in
fact
then
rice
has
to
serve
an
aggregate
of
time
in
jail
which
exceeds
the
maximum
for
the
offense.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
wasn't
this
a
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn't
this
case
ever
bump
federal
habeas?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
nobody
has
been
out
on
here,
has
been
out
on
bail
while
he
was
serving
his
sentence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
suppose
you're
arguing
too
are
you
mr.
lawson
that
if
on
the
same
day,
two
who
had
pleaded
guilty
to
second-degree
burglary
or
robbery
whatever
this
is,
each
got
ten
years.
one
did
appeal,
seek
this
collateral
remedy
because
he
didn't
have
counsel.
the
other
did
have
counsel
either
and
he
didn't
appeal.
at
the
end
of
six
years,
he'd
be
out,
whereas
this
fellow
is
going
to
have
to
serve
12.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that's
a
denial
of
equal
protection
as
between
prisoners
who
stay
in
the
same
situation
merely
because
he
sought
a
relief
from
this
unconstitutional
conviction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
another
possible
view
that
if
the
second
sentences
were
then
statutory
maximum
that
really
all
that
he's
entitled
to
do
is
to
be
sure
that
credit
and
time
already
served?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
--
i
wonder
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
what
the
federal
constitution
imposes
in
the
way
it
will
restrain
in
this
circumstance
on
a
new
sentence.
isn't
that
we're
talking
about.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
focusing
on
that,
if
he
--
actually,
he
sought
to
have
a
first
conviction
set
aside
and
the
hope
that
on
a
new
trial
he'd
be
acquitted
i
take
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
the
reason
he
did
it,
was
it.
and
if
that's
the
chance
he
wants
to
take
and
the
--
and
he
fails
and
the
sentence
for
whatever
reason
is
within
the
statutory
limit
on
the
new
sentence,
does
he
really
have
any
justification
for
asking
for
more
than
an
assistance
that
he
get
credit
on
time
already
served
in
the
first
sentence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
that's
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
believe
my
question
to
you
was
is
it
that
another
possible
view
of
this
problem?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
stroud,
you
say
only

stroud,
do
you
suppose
that
stroud
would
have
been
more

anymore
successful

in
green?
justice
william
j.

that

at
that
time,
clearly
double
jeopardy
--
there's
no
suggestion
of
double

by
the

wasn't
it?
justice
william
j.

wasn't

mr.

i

that
this

a

suppose

if

could

could
he
have
served
that
long?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let's
take
six
years.
just
before
he
had
served
these
six
years,
then
he
succeeds
in
getting
the
conviction
set
aside
for
denial
of
assistance
of

and
he
goes
to
trial.
now,
do
i

on

he
could

at

justice
william
j.

well,
then

then
in
fact
then
rice
has
to
serve
an
aggregate
of
time
in
jail
which
exceeds
the
maximum
for
the
offense.
justice
william
j.

william

didn't

justice

well,
