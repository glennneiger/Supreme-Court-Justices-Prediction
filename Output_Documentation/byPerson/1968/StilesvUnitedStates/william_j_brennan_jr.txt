justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rogers,
may
i
ask
you,
i
noticed
you
opened
--
you
said
you're
going
to
give
only
20
minutes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
haven't
yet
touched
on
the
issue
that
i
must
say
to
you
in
all
candors,
the
only
one
really
concerns
me
in
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
one,
the
refusal
of
the
trial
judge
to
postpone
the
trial,
are
you
going
to
get
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
this
the
situation
that
as
you
saw
it
at
the
time
--
if
the
government
were
to
find
on
an
examination
that
he
was
not
in
fact
fit
for
induction
that
then
the
government
is
having
said
that
those
who
--
this
examination,
if
the
find,
“i
am
fit
for
induction,
i'll
be
inducted.”
the
government
would've
dismissed
this
prosecution,
is
that
it?
and
that
you
wanted
an
opportunity
to
go
through
this
examination
and
the
trial
judge
refused
you
there
to
--
is
that
what
it
all
comes
down
to?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i'm
looking
at
this
colloquy
between
the
trial
judge
and
the
--
mr.
giron
i
gather
represented
the
government.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
mr.
giron
says,
this
is
the
position
that
if
this
man
submits
to
induction
in
all
probability,
he
will
not
be
acceptable
anyway.
but
in
view
of
the
fact
that
he's
willing
to
get
down
for
induction,
the
government
would
take
the
position
and
the
united
states
attorney
has
recommended
that
there
would
be
no
further
prosecution
because
it
would
really
in
effect,
if
it
were
a
person
who
could
be
eligible
for
the
armed
force
services,
there
would
be
a
point
in
going
forward
with
it.
but
insofar
as
this
person
while
charged
with
failure
to
report
for
induction
which
is
a
serious
crime,
etcetera.
and
then
each
court
says,
“well,
aren't
you
ready
to
go
--
are
you
ready
to
go
to
trial
or
aren't
you?”
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
the
government
had
to
--
in
effect,
i
thought
your
position
was
--
although
the
government
was
willing
to
postpone
the
trial
and
not
even
to
go
forward
with
the
prosecution
if
in
fact
it
were
determined
that
he
was
not
fit
for
induction.
the
trial
judge
didn't
give
you
the
opportunity
to
have
the
examination
made
which
would
determine
that
fact,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
is
that
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
apart
--
mr.
solicitor
general,
from
the
prosecution
as
such,
i
gather
that
a
finding
that
he
was
unfit
might
have
a
bearing
might
it
not
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
trial
should've
been
postponed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
rogers,
may
i
ask
you,
i
noticed
you
opened

you
said
you're
going

20

j.

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that's
one,
the
refusal
of
the
trial
judge
to
postpone
the
trial,
are
you
going

get
to
that?

is

and
that
