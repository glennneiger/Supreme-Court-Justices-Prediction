justice
abe
fortas
oh,
was
that
the
issue
that
you
were
raising,
the
so-called
insanity
issue
whether
he
was
emotionally
unfit
for
military
service
or
were
you
raising
a
defense
in
conventional
criminal
terms
that
the
view
of
the
m'naghten
test
or
that
he
was
unable
to
distinguish
between
right
or
wrong
or
unable
to
control
his
actions.
what
sort
of
insanity
defense
were
you
making?
justice
abe
fortas
well
then,
does
the
question
of
whether
he
was
or
was
not
mentally
or
emotionally
suitable
for
a
military
service
and
then
being
new
at
the
m'naghten
rule
except
possibly
that
it
involves
some
of
the
same
criterion
but
the
standards
are
quite
different,
isn't
it?
justice
abe
fortas
let's
say,
what
fitness
or
unfitness
has
an
emotional
matter
for
a
military
service
have
to
do
with
the
issues
that
were
before
the
district
court
and
now
before
us?
justice
abe
fortas
on
the
m'naghten
basis?
justice
abe
fortas
the
m'naghten
test?
justice
abe
fortas
right.
justice
abe
fortas
alright.
justice
abe
fortas
well,
are
you
--
now
you're
saying
insane.
in
your
argument,
you
were
saying
that
he
was
unfit
for
military
service.
now
what
did
the
psychiatrist
testified
to?
justice
abe
fortas
he
testified
in
terms
of
an
american
law
institute
case
test
or
the
m'naghten
test
or
did
he
test
by
in
terms
of
the
military
suitability?
justice
abe
fortas
you
are
here
urging
that
its
reversed
--
the
trial
judge
may
--
have
committed
reversible
error
by
failing
to
find
that
the
judgment
against
the
defendant
should've
been
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
justice
abe
fortas
you're
not
really
suggesting
that
petitioner
in
good
faith
left
a
series
of
forwarding
addresses?
justice
abe
fortas
that
wasn't
my
question.
justice
abe
fortas
my
question
was
whether
that
your
contention
based
on
this
record
that
the
judge
should
have
instructed
the
jury
to
bring
in
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
because
you're
client
in
good
faith
left
a
series
of
forwarding
addresses
at
which
he
might
have
received
notice
had
the
board
been
diligent
in
giving
him
notice.
justice
abe
fortas
oh,
was
that
the
issue
that
you
were
raising,
the
so-called
insanity
issue
whether
