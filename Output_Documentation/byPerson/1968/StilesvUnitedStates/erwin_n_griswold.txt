mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
troublesome
case.
they
say
that
hindsight
is
always
20-20
and
there
are
at
least
a
half
a
dozen
points
where
i
wished
had
been
handled
differently
and
might
not
have
come
here.
however,
in
reviewing
it
in
our
office,
although
there
are
a
number
of
critical
points,
we
found
none
where
it
seemed
to
us
appropriate
for
officials
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
to
do
anything
but
to
present
the
case
to
the
court.
there
are
several
critical
points.
there
are
some
issues
which
i
think
are
not
serious
and
which
i
will
leave
to
the
brief.
it
seems
to
me
clear
for
example
that
the
defendant
was
not
“insane”
within
the
legal
definition
of
that
term.
that
the
--
there's
virtually
no
evidence
that
he
was
insane
and
the
jury's
verdict
that
he
was
not
insane
should
not
be
subject
to
review.
it
also
seems
to
me
clear
that
proof
that
he
was
“unfit
for
military
service”
is
irrelevant
in
this
particular
prosecution
otherwise
any
person
who
had
a
health
impairment
could
simply
ignore
the
whole
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
question
whether
the
trial
should
be
postponed
is
another
issue.
the
--
there
was
in
their
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
what
i
might
say
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
and
that
is
one
of
the
two
issues
which
i
am
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
i'm
picking
out
of
the
group.
i
am
simply
trying
now
to
dispose
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
of
others
and
perhaps
i
didn't
make
it
clear
it
enough
that
that
i
have
thought
of
as
a
somewhat
different
issue
than
the
one
as
to
whether
the
trial
should
have
been
postponed.
then
there
was
an
argument
about
the
authority
of
the
clerk
of
the
draft
board
to
issue
the
notice
and
i
don't
think
that
is
an
issue.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
principal
places
where
there
are
problems.
the
first
arises
out
of
the
form
of
the
statute
which
makes
it
a
crime
if
a
person
knowingly
fails
or
neglects
to
or
refuses
to
perform
any
duty.
and
the
question
of
the
effect
of
knowingly,
i
would
point
out
that
the
indictment
goes
even
further,
the
indictment
says,
willfully
and
knowingly.
the
statute
only
requires
knowingly.
i
don't
know
whether
there's
any
difference.
i
think
it
is
arguable
that
knowingly
and
that
statute
doesn't
quite
mean
perception
within
the
mind
but
means
what
we
use
to
call
mens
rea
that
he
--
the
circumstances
were
such
that
he
knew
he
was
doing
wrong.
now
with
respect
to
that,
it
is
probably
clear
that
he
did
not
in
fact
himself
received
or
know
about
the
notice
to
report
for
induction.
and
so
we
do
have
a
case
in
which
the
government
has
to
maintain
that
he
knowingly
fail
to
report
for
induction
although
he
did
not
have
actual
knowledge
of
the
notice
to
report
for
induction.
there's
a
long
history
in
this
case.
going
back
to
1963
when
the
defendant
filed
a
printed
form
in
which
he
filled
out
his
name
with
the
draft
board
in
which
he
declared
his
disaffiliation
from
the
draft
system.
he
was
however
at
that
time
a
student
and
the
board
continued
his
ii-s
student
deferment.
in
the
fall
of
1965,
he
ceased
to
be
a
student.
the
board
sent
him
on
november
29,
1965
and
ordered
to
report
for
a
physical
examination.
he
ignored
that.
he
did
not
report.
the
board,
it
seems
to
me
used
certain
amount
of
calm
at
that
time.
on
december
21,
1965
they
sent
him
a
second
order
to
report
for
a
physical
examination
on
january
6,
1966.
and
the
record
is
clear
that
he
received
both
of
these
notices
and
that
he
failed
to
report
on
january
6,
1966.
on
january
11th,
five
days
later,
he
was
declared
delinquent
under
the
regulations
of
the
selective
service
system.
a
delinquency
notice
was
sent
to
him.
and
the
record
is
clear
that
he
received
that
delinquency
notice.
the
particular
notice
which
was
sent
to
him
was
a
somewhat
old
form.
we
have
examined
it
in
the
record.
it
advised
him
that
he
was
subject
to
criminal
penalties.
it
did
not
advise
him
as
the
regulations
plainly
say
that
he
would
be
subject
to
immediate
induction,
ahead
of
--
even
of
volunteers.
on
january
14th,
he
was
ordered
for
a
third
time
to
report
for
a
physical
examination,
this
to
be
on
january
20,
1966.
and
it
was
on
january
17th
that
he
sent
to
the
local
board
the
letter
which
appears
on
page
48
of
the
appendix.
and
i
think
i'll
read
the
whole
letter,
it's
somewhat
bizarre.
“dear
sirs,
your
threatening
letters
continually
arrive
telling
me
exactly
what
to
do
and
informing
me
of
the
penalties
for
not
complying
with
your
directives.”
now
that
shows
that
he
was
aware
that
he
was
in
a
somewhat
serious
situation.
“in
response,
i
can
only
repeat
my
previous
assertions
that
i
am
unwilling
to
be
a
part
of
the
organized
murder
and
threat
of
murder
which
is
the
basis
of
any
army.”
i
may
point
out,
however,
he
has
never
made
a
claim
of
conscientious
objection
at
any
time
either
in
the
records
or
in
connection
with
the
trial.
there
are
better
forms
of
communication
and
impersonal
printed
forms
filled
with
orders
and
threats.
if
the
man
is
to
function
socially,
it's
something
more
than
a
self-destructive
machine.
the
improvement
of
communication
is
of
great
importance.
“if
you
wish
to
discuss
these
matters
further
perhaps
we
could
arrange
a
mutually
convenient
time
and
place.
i
hope
that
you
folks
can
write
above
crude
attempts
of
manipulation
and
engage
in
some
constructive
interaction.
love,
bill
stiles.”
then
a
postscript,
“i
am
soon
going
to
take
a
vacation
trip
of
a
month
or
two.
i
tell
you
this
because
my
leaving
town
with
no
definitive
forwarding
address
might
otherwise
seem
evasive.
don't
worry,
i'll
send
you
postcards
letting
you
know
how
i
am
getting
along.”
and
the
--
he
then
did
leave
town.
apparently
about
january
20th,
he
--
the
record
contains
some
evidence
that
he
was
very
much
concerned
about
the
reporting
for
the
physical
examination
on
january
20th
that
he
came
pretty
close
to
doing
it
but
that
he
finally
pulled
out.
and
it
was
on
january
24th
that
the
board
sent
him
the
notice
to
report
for
induction
on
february
9th.
mr.
rogers
has
said
something
about
this
being
received
at
a
different
address
to
which
it
was
sent.
that
is
true
but
i
think
quite
immaterial,
the
place
where
it
was
addressed
was
10
fulton
street,
westerly,
rhode
island
and
it
was
received
at
post
office
box
10,
westerly,
rhode
island
which
is
the
place
where
the
mail
for
10
fulton
street
is
delivered
because
the
people
who
lived
there
have
a
post
office
box.
it
was
received
by
his
mother
and
signed
for
by
his
mother.
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
the
mother
didn't
open
it
and
that
the
contents
were
not
communicated
to
his
son
--
to
her
son,
i
may
say
too
that
this
was
his
last
known
address
and
the
record
includes
the
regulation
of
the
draft
of
the
selective
service
system
that
the
mailing
of
any
order,
notice
or
blank
form
by
the
local
board
to
a
registrant
at
the
address
last
reported
by
him
to
the
local
board
shall
constitute
notice
to
him
of
the
contents
of
the
communication
whether
he
actually
receives
it
or
not.
he
on
february
11th
sent
a
postcard
from
the
--
to
the
draft
board
from
knoxville,
tennessee
in
which
he
said
he
was
still
thinking
of
them.
and
then
on
february
15th,
he
mailed
a
postcard
from
veracruz,
mexico
which
is
on
page
51-52
of
the
record
and
i
would
simply
point
out
that
the
address
he
give
--
he
gave
their
in
spanish
is
simply
general
delivery,
veracruz,
mexico
which
is
not
a
very
permanent
address.
he
returned
to
rhode
island
about
the
middle
of
march.
i
find
it
difficult
to
say
that
the
record
contains
enough
evidence
so
that
the
jury
could've
found
that
he
actually
knew
of
the
notice
to
report
for
induction.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
contains
adequate
evidence
to
support
a
determination
by
the
jury
that
he
was
well
aware
that
such
a
notice
was
very
likely
to
come
and
that
he
took
steps
to
obstruct
the
communication
of
the
knowledge
to
him.
and
in
the
bartchy
case
to
which
mr.
rogers
has
referred
in
319
u.s.
involving
a
seaman
who
did
take
steps
to
see
that
the
draft
notice
came
to
him.
he
gave
the
houston
address
of
his
union.
he
informed
the
union
that
he
would
be
in
new
york
and
told
them
to
send
it
to
the
union
office
in
new
york.
the
houston
office
did
send
it
to
the
new
york
office.
the
new
york
office
made
a
mistake
and
instead
of
delivering
it
to
him,
sent
it
back
to
houston
when
he
called
from
maryland,
new
york,
they
said
there
was
none.
in
that
case
the
trial
court
acquitted
the
defendant
of
failure
to
report
for
induction
but
convicted
him
of
failure
to
keep
the
board
informed
as
to
his
address.
this
court
reversed
the
conviction
on
the
latter
point,
concluding
that
he
had
taken
appropriate
steps
and
it
was
not
his
fault
that
it
had
not
--
got
to
him.
in
the
course
of
the
opinion
however,
the
court
said
speaking
through
mr.
justice
reed
on
page
489,
“the
regulation
it
seems
to
us
is
satisfied
when
the
registrant
in
good
faith
provides
a
chain
of
forwarding
addresses
by
which
mails
sent
to
the
address
which
is
furnished
to
the
board
may
be
by
the
registrant
reasonably
expected
to
come
in
to
his
hands
in
time
for
compliance.”
and
it's
quite
clear
here
that
he
did
not
do
that.
the
district
court
charged
the
jury
that
they
had
to
find
that
he
knowingly
and
willfully
failed
to
report
for
induction
and
the
jury
found
him
guilty.
it
--
on
the
whole
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
evidence
to
support
that
verdict.
i
think
i
am
concerned
about
the
consequence
of
a
decision
to
the
contrary
because
i
can
see
the
article
in
the
selective
service
law
reporter
which
will
advise
people
that
when
you
know
that
the
draft
notice
is
about
to
come,
write
to
your
board
that
you're
about
to
take
a
vacation
and
you'll
let
them
know
and
be
sure
that
you
see
to
it
that
whoever
is
at
home
to
receive
the
mail
doesn't
it
open
and
doesn't
let
you
know
anything
about
it.
and
if
that
is
a
way
to
avoid
the
obligation
to
report
for
induction,
it
could
be
a
fairly
serious
matter.
now
let
me
turn
to
the
other
aspect
of
the
case
which
i
think
was
the
part
that
first
gave
me
concern
when
i
knew
about
the
case.
anyone
who
has
been
an
educational
administrator
for
a
good
part
of
his
life
has
--
had
contact
with
the
situations
like
this,
it's
very
hard
to
know
just
where
to
draw
lines
here.
it
was
obvious
this
young
man
needed
help
and
certainly
mr.
rogers
has
devoted
a
great
deal
of
his
time,
energy
and
skill
in
providing
that
help.
i'm
rather
thinking
of
help
at
an
earlier
stage.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i've
--
the
record
shows
that
he
was
classified
2-s.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
says
columbia
university
at
the
time
of
trial
whether
he
was
a
student.
well,
the
record
by
mr.
connelly
showed
me
at
page
73,
he
--
the
mr.
knotty
who
--
no,
the
fbi
agent,
i
believe
testified,
he
offered
as
an
example
the
fact
that
he
had
registered
at
the
university
of
rhode
island
and
then
failed
to
attend
classes
and
has
as
a
result
failed
the
course.
and
whether
he
had
continued
to
be
a
student
at
the
university
of
rhode
island,
i
don't
know.
at
the
time
of
trial,
he
was
a
student
at
the
columbia
university.
whether
he
was
successfully
pursuing
that,
of
course
again,
i
don't
know.
now
the
colloquy
i
--
obviously
i'm
not
going
to
take
time
to
read
it
all,
it's
in
the
record
at
pages
20
to
23.
it's
set
out
in
full
in
our
brief
at
pages
16
to
18.
as
officer
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
government,
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
the
conclusion
that
that
was
a
motion
for
a
continuance
even
if
it
were
a
motion
for
a
continuance,
the
question
of
its
granting
by
many
decisions
and
by
proper
judicial
administration
as
a
matter
for
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge.
almost
never
i
suppose
is
a
denial
of
a
continuance
regarded
as
error.
i
suppose
you
can
amend
that
and
say
for
the
sound
discretion
of
the
trial
judge,
whether
it
was
sound
here
or
not,
i
don't
know.
as
i've
indicated,
it's
easy
to
second
guess.
my
own
wish
is
that
the
judge
has
said,
“well
let's
--
let
this
go
over
a
couple
of
days
and
see
what
happens.”
he
didn't
do
that.
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
how
an
officer
of
the
department
of
justice
can
say
that
the
judge
did
not
act
in
a
properly
judicial
manner
in
making
that
determination.
its
--
that
passage
is
very
appealing,
it
was
very
appealing
to
me
as
i
looked
into
it
and
examined
it.
i
did
think
it
appropriate
to
bring
it
specifically
to
the
court's
attention
in
the
brief
in
opposition
which
we
filed
here.
but
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
either
a
motion
for
a
continuance
or
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
denying
it
if
it
was
treated
as
a
motion
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
what
--
mr.
justice
what
--
where
is
it
on
page
18?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
yes.
he
says,
we
would
continue.
whether
that's
a
motion
for
a
continuance,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
greatly
care.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
even
if
it
is,
i
think
the
judge
had
discretion
to
deny
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
either
he
is
guilty
or
he
isn't,
i
guess
it's
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
agree
mr.
justice.
i
wish
it
hadn't
been
handled
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
hadn't
been
handled
the
way
it
was
but
i,
except
in
terms
of
what
is
sometimes
referred
to
in
the
books
as
this
court's
supervisory
power
over
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
i
find
it
--
well,
i
didn't
find
a
ground
upon
which
i
could
say
that
i
thought
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that's
exactly
what
i
get
out.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that's
the
most
i
can
get
out
of
it.
i
think
i
can
properly
say
i
have
no
objection
if
anybody
else
can
get
more
out
of
it
but
that's
the
most
that
i
could
get
out
of
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
troublesome
case.
they
say
that
hindsight
is
always
20-20
and
there
are
at
least
a
half
a
dozen
points
where
i
wished
had
been
handled
differently
and
might
not
have
come
here.
however,
in
reviewing
it
in
our
office,
although
there
are
a
number
of
critical
points,
we
found
none
where
it
seemed
to
us
appropriate
for
officials
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
to
do
anything
but
to
present
the
case
to
the
court.
there
are
several
critical
points.
there
are
some
issues
which
i
think
are
not
serious
and
which
i
will
leave
to
the
brief.
it
seems
to
me
clear
for
example
that
the
defendant
was
not
“insane”
within
the
legal
definition
of
that
term.
that
the
--
there's
virtually
no
evidence
that
he
was
insane
and
the
jury's
verdict
that
he
was
not
insane
should
not
be
subject
to
review.
it
also
seems
to
me
clear
that
proof
that
he
was
“unfit
for
military
service”
is
irrelevant
in
this
particular
prosecution
otherwise
any
person
who
had
a
health
impairment
could
simply
ignore
the
whole
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
question
whether
the
trial
should
be
postponed
is
another
issue.
the
--
there
was
in
their
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
what
i
might
say
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice
and
that
is
one
of
the
two
issues
which
i
am
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
i'm
picking
out
of
the
group.
i
am
simply
trying
now
to
dispose
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
of
others
and
perhaps
i
didn't
make
it
clear
it
enough
that
that
i
have
thought
of
as
a
somewhat
different
issue
than
the
one
as
to
whether
the
trial
should
have
been
postponed.
then
there
was
an
argument
about
the
authority
of
the
clerk
of
the
draft
board
to
issue
the
notice
and
i
don't
think
that
is
an
issue.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
principal
places
where
there
are
problems.
the
first
arises
out
of
the
form
of
the
statute
which
makes
it
a
crime
if
a
person
knowingly
fails
or
neglects
to
or
refuses
to
perform
any
duty.
and
the
question
of
the
effect
of
knowingly,
i
would
point
out
that
the
indictment
goes
even
further,
the
indictment
says,
willfully
and
knowingly.
the
statute
only
requires
knowingly.
i
don't
know
whether
there's
any
difference.
i
think
it
is
arguable
that
knowingly
and
that
statute
doesn't
quite
mean
perception
within
the
mind
but
means
what
we
use
to
call
mens
rea
that
he
--
the
circumstances
were
such
that
he
knew
he
was
doing
wrong.
now
with
respect
to
that,
it
is
probably
clear
that
he
did
not
in
fact
himself
received
or
know
about
the
notice
to
report
for
induction.
and
so
we
do
have
a
case
in
which
the
government
has
to
maintain
that
he
knowingly
fail
to
report
for
induction
although
he
did
not
have
actual
knowledge
of
the
notice
to
report
for
induction.
there's
a
long
history
in
this
case.
going
back
to
1963
when
the
defendant
filed
a
printed
form
in
which
he
filled
out
his
name
with
the
draft
board
in
which
he
declared
his
disaffiliation
from
the
draft
system.
he
was
however
at
that
time
a
student
and
the
board
continued
his
ii-s
student
deferment.
in
the
fall
of
1965,
he
ceased
to
be
a
student.
the
board
sent
him
on
november
29,
1965
and
ordered
to
report
for
a
physical
examination.
he
ignored
that.
he
did
not
report.
the
board,
it
seems
to
me
used
certain
amount
of
calm
at
that
time.
on
december
21,
1965
they
sent
him
a
second
order
to
report
for
a
physical
examination
on
january
6,
1966.
and
the
record
is
clear
that
he
received
both
of
these
notices
and
that
he
failed
to
report
on
january
6,
1966.
on
january
11th,
five
days
later,
he
was
declared
delinquent
under
the
regulations
of
the
selective
service
system.
a
delinquency
notice
was
sent
to
him.
and
the
record
is
clear
that
he
received
that
delinquency
notice.
the
particular
notice
which
was
sent
to
him
was
a
somewhat
old
form.
we
have
examined
it
in
the
record.
it
advised
him
that
he
was
subject
to
criminal
penalties.
it
did
not
advise
him
as
the
regulations
plainly
say
that
he
would
be
subject
to
immediate
induction,
ahead
of
--
even
of
volunteers.
on
january
14th,
he
was
ordered
for
a
third
time
to
report
for
a
physical
examination,
this
to
be
on
january
20,
1966.
and
it
was
on
january
17th
that
he
sent
to
the
local
board
the
letter
which
appears
on
page
48
of
the
appendix.
and
i
think
i'll
read
the
whole
letter,
it's
somewhat
bizarre.
“dear
sirs,
your
threatening
letters
continually
arrive
telling
me
exactly
what
to
do
and
informing
me
of
the
penalties
for
not
complying
with
your
directives.”
now
that
shows
that
he
was
aware
that
he
was
in
a
somewhat
serious
situation.
“in
response,
i
can
only
repeat
my
previous
assertions
that
i
am
unwilling
to
be
a
part
of
the
organized
murder
and
threat
of
murder
which
is
the
basis
of
any
army.”
i
may
point
out,
however,
he
has
never
made
a
claim
of
conscientious
objection
at
any
time
either
in
the
records
or
in
connection
with
the
trial.
there
are
better
forms
of
communication
and
impersonal
printed
forms
filled
with
orders
and
threats.
if
the
man
is
to
function
socially,
it's
something
more
than
a
self-destructive
machine.
the
improvement
of
communication
is
of
great
importance.
“if
you
wish
to
discuss
these
matters
further
perhaps
we
could
arrange
a
mutually
convenient
time
and
place.
i
hope
that
you
folks
can
write
above
crude
attempts
of
manipulation
and
engage
in
some
constructive
interaction.
love,
bill
stiles.”
then
a
postscript,
“i
am
soon
going
to
take
a
vacation
trip
of
a
month
or
two.
i
tell
you
this
because
my
leaving
town
with
no
definitive
forwarding
address
might
otherwise
seem
evasive.
don't
worry,
i'll
send
you
postcards
letting
you
know
how
i
am
getting
along.”
and
the
--
he
then
did
leave
town.
apparently
about
january
20th,
he
--
the
record
contains
some
evidence
that
he
was
very
much
concerned
about
the
reporting
for
the
physical
examination
on
january
20th
that
he
came
pretty
close
to
doing
it
but
that
he
finally
pulled
out.
and
it
was
on
january
24th
that
the
board
sent
him
the
notice
to
report
for
induction
on
february
9th.
mr.
rogers
has
said
something
about
this
being
received
at
a
different
address
to
which
it
was
sent.
that
is
true
but
i
think
quite
immaterial,
the
place
where
it
was
addressed
was
10
fulton
street,
westerly,
rhode
island
and
it
was
received
at
post
office
box
10,
westerly,
rhode
island
which
is
the
place
where
the
mail
for
10
fulton
street
is
delivered
because
the
people
who
lived
there
have
a
post
office
box.
it
was
received
by
his
mother
and
signed
for
by
his
mother.
the
record
is
quite
clear
that
the
mother
didn't
open
it
and
that
the
contents
were
not
communicated
to
his
son
--
to
her
son,
i
may
say
too
that
this
was
his
last
known
address
and
the
record
includes
the
regulation
of
the
draft
of
the
selective
service
system
that
the
mailing
of
any
order,
notice
or
blank
form
by
the
local
board
to
a
registrant
at
the
address
last
reported
by
him
to
the
local
board
shall
constitute
notice
to
him
of
the
contents
of
the
communication
whether
he
actually
receives
it
or
not.
he
on
february
11th
sent
a
postcard
from
the
--
to
the
draft
board
from
knoxville,
tennessee
in
which
he
said
he
was
still
thinking
of
them.
and
then
on
february
15th,
he
mailed
a
postcard
from
veracruz,
mexico
which
is
on
page
51-52
of
the
record
and
i
would
simply
point
out
that
the
address
he
give
--
he
gave
their
in
spanish
is
simply
general
delivery,
veracruz,
mexico
which
is
not
a
very
permanent
address.
he
returned
to
rhode
island
about
the
middle
of
march.
i
find
it
difficult
to
say
that
the
record
contains
enough
evidence
so
that
the
jury
could've
found
that
he
actually
knew
of
the
notice
to
report
for
induction.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
contains
adequate
evidence
to
support
a
determination
by
the
jury
that
he
was
well
aware
that
such
a
notice
was
very
likely
to
come
and
that
he
took
steps
to
obstruct
the
communication
of
the
knowledge
to
him.
and
in
the
bartchy
case
to
which
mr.
rogers
has
referred
in
319
u.s.
involving
a
seaman
who
did
take
steps
to
see
that
the
draft
notice
came
to
him.
he
gave
the
houston
address
of
his
union.
he
informed
the
union
that
he
would
be
in
new
york
and
told
them
to
send
it
to
the
union
office
in
new
york.
the
houston
office
did
send
it
to
the
new
york
office.
the
new
york
office
made
a
mistake
and
instead
of
delivering
it
to
him,
sent
it
back
to
houston
when
he
called
from
maryland,
new
york,
they
said
there
was
none.
in
that
case
the
trial
court
acquitted
the
defendant
of
failure
to
report
for
induction
but
convicted
him
of
failure
to
keep
the
board
informed
as
to
his
address.
this
court
reversed
the
conviction
on
the
latter
point,
concluding
that
he
had
taken
appropriate
steps
and
it
was
not
his
fault
that
it
had
not
--
got
to
him.
in
the
course
of
the
opinion
however,
the
court
said
speaking
through
mr.
justice
reed
on
page
489,
“the
regulation
it
seems
to
us
is
satisfied
when
the
registrant
in
good
faith
provides
a
chain
of
forwarding
addresses
by
which
mails
sent
to
the
address
which
is
furnished
to
the
board
may
be
by
the
registrant
reasonably
expected
to
come
in
to
his
hands
in
time
for
compliance.”
and
it's
quite
clear
here
that
he
did
not
do
that.
the
district
court
charged
the
jury
that
they
had
to
find
that
he
knowingly
and
willfully
failed
to
report
for
induction
and
the
jury
found
him
guilty.
it
--
on
the
whole
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
evidence
to
support
that
verdict.
i
think
i
am
concerned
about
the
consequence
of
a
decision
to
the
contrary
because
i
can
see
the
article
in
the
selective
service
law
reporter
which
will
advise
people
that
when
you
know
that
the
draft
notice
is
about
to
come,
write
to
your
board
that
you're
about
to
take
a
vacation
and
you'll
let
them
know
and
be
sure
that
you
see
to
it
that
whoever
is
at
home
to
receive
the
mail
doesn't
it
open
and
doesn't
let
you
know
anything
about
it.
and
if
that
is
a
way
to
avoid
the
obligation
to
report
for
induction,
it
could
be
a
fairly
serious
matter.
now
let
me
turn
to
the
other
aspect
of
the
case
which
i
think
was
the
part
that
first
gave
me
concern
when
i
knew
about
the
case.
anyone
who
has
been
an
educational
administrator
for
a
good
part
of
his
life
has
--
had
contact
with
the
situations
like
this,
it's
very
hard
to
know
just
where
to
draw
lines
here.
it
was
obvious
this
young
man
needed
help
and
certainly
mr.
rogers
has
devoted
a
great
deal
of
his
time,
energy
and
skill
in
providing
that
help.
i'm
rather
thinking
of
help
at
an
earlier
stage.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i've
--
the
record
shows
that
he
was
classified
2-s.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
says
columbia
university
at
the
time
of
trial
whether
he
was
a
student.
well,
the
record
by
mr.
connelly
showed
me
at
page
73,
he
--
the
mr.
knotty
who
--
no,
the
fbi
agent,
i
believe
testified,
he
offered
as
an
example
the
fact
that
he
had
registered
at
the
university
of
rhode
island
and
then
failed
to
attend
classes
and
has
as
a
result
failed
the
course.
and
whether
he
had
continued
to
be
a
student
at
the
university
of
rhode
island,
i
don't
know.
at
the
time
of
trial,
he
was
a
student
at
the
columbia
university.
whether
he
was
successfully
pursuing
that,
of
course
again,
i
don't
know.
now
the
colloquy
i
--
obviously
i'm
not
going
to
take
time
to
read
it
all,
it's
in
the
record
at
pages
20
to
23.
it's
set
out
in
full
in
our
brief
at
pages
16
to
18.
as
officer
in
the
executive
branch
of
the
government,
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
the
conclusion
that
that
was
a
motion
for
a
continuance
even
if
it
were
a
motion
for
a
continuance,
the
question
of
its
granting
by
many
decisions
and
by
proper
judicial
administration
as
a
matter
for
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge.
almost
never
i
suppose
is
a
denial
of
a
continuance
regarded
as
error.
i
suppose
you
can
amend
that
and
say
for
the
sound
discretion
of
the
trial
judge,
whether
it
was
sound
here
or
not,
i
don't
know.
as
i've
indicated,
it's
easy
to
second
guess.
my
own
wish
is
that
the
judge
has
said,
“well
let's
--
let
this
go
over
a
couple
of
days
and
see
what
happens.”
he
didn't
do
that.
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
how
an
officer
of
the
department
of
justice
can
say
that
the
judge
did
not
act
in
a
properly
judicial
manner
in
making
that
determination.
its
--
that
passage
is
very
appealing,
it
was
very
appealing
to
me
as
i
looked
into
it
and
examined
it.
i
did
think
it
appropriate
to
bring
it
specifically
to
the
court's
attention
in
the
brief
in
opposition
which
we
filed
here.
but
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
either
a
motion
for
a
continuance
or
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
denying
it
if
it
was
treated
as
a
motion
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
what
--
mr.
justice
what
--
where
is
it
on
page
18?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
yes.
he
says,
we
would
continue.
whether
that's
a
motion
for
a
continuance,
i
don't
know.
i
don't
greatly
care.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
because
even
if
it
is,
i
think
the
judge
had
discretion
to
deny
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
either
he
is
guilty
or
he
isn't,
i
guess
it's
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
agree
mr.
justice.
i
wish
it
hadn't
been
handled
the
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
hadn't
been
handled
the
way
it
was
but
i,
except
in
terms
of
what
is
sometimes
referred
to
in
the
books
as
this
court's
supervisory
power
over
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
i
find
it
--
well,
i
didn't
find
a
ground
upon
which
i
could
say
that
i
thought
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that's
exactly
what
i
get
out.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
think
that's
the
most
i
can
get
out
of
it.
i
think
i
can
properly
say
i
have
no
objection
if
anybody
else
can
get
more
out
of
it
but
that's
the
most
that
i
could
get
out
of
it.
