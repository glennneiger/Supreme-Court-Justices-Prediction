mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
distinguished
justices
of
the
honorable
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
i
would
like
to
indicate
at
the
outset
for
the
record
that
i
would
like
to
allocate
my
time
in
20
minutes
for
argument
and
reserve
10
minutes
if
possible
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
also
for
the
record
indicate
that
i
was
assisted
and
i
truly
appreciate
the
help
from
the
solicitor
of
this
court,
john
knotty,
iii
of
rhode
island.
the
petitioner
if
it
please
the
court
is
under
sentence
at
the
present
time
to
a
term
of
two
years,
an
institution
to
be
decided
by
the
united
states
attorney
general.
he
was
charged,
tried
and
convicted
first
in
the
district
of
rhode
island
in
the
federal
district
court
for
a
willful
failure
and
a
knowing
failure
to
report
for
induction
at
the
military
forces
of
the
united
states.
the
trouble
of
the
case
i
feel
is
accurately
cited
in
the
brief
for
petitioner
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
perhaps
the
crowning
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
defendant
in
that
case
and
the
appellant
here
did
in
fact
have
noticed
of
the
draft
notice
itself.
the
record
i
feel
is
replete
of
testimony
that
would
clearly
indicate
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
philip
jerome
stiles
did
not
in
fact
receive
a
notice
that
was
sent
to
him
by
the
draft
board
from
westerly,
rhode
island.
the
first
contact
of
the
petitioner
had
with
the
selective
service
system
of
the
united
states
occurred
on
the
18th
day
of
april
1963
wherein
he
filled
down
his
application
pursuant
to
the
regulations.
i
indicate
to
chief
justice
and
your
honorable
justices
of
this
court
that
his
first
communication
with
them
subsequent
thereto
was
on
05/17/1963
wherein
the
petitioner's
case
advised
his
local
selective
service
draft
board
that
he
would
in
fact
be
in
the
state
of
tennessee
and
the
transcript
will
indicate
that
this
was
received
by
the
local
draft
board
on
the
20th
day
of
may
1963.
the
matter
of
notice
relative
to
a
receipt
of
draft
notices
has
in
fact
been
discussed
on
the
case
of
bartchy
versus
the
united
states
and
i
submit
that
this
is
a
very
important
case.
the
case
does
indicate
that
the
defendant
does
have
a
duty
to
promptly
advice
his
draft
board
of
his
address
but
the
case
indicates
that
he
is
not.
in
fact
the
client
remained
in
one
place
provided
even
he
is
in
fact
anticipating
the
arrival
of
a
draft
notice.
i
submit
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
did
not
in
fact
anticipate
a
draft
notice.
i
must
admit
and
i
do
admit
that
the
petition
in
this
case
directed
communications
to
the
local
draft
board
that
contained
a
language
that
was
less
than
desirable
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
recipient.
however,
the
defendant
did
in
fact
and
the
appellant
in
this
case
did
in
fact
notified
his
draft
board
that
he
would
in
fact
not
be
at
the
address
that
was
listed
on
his
papers
in
the
custody
of
the
draft
board
and
subsequent
thereto
he
was
sent
an
induction
notice
but
the
draft
board.
he
notified
them
by
letter
on
january
17,
1966
and
he
advised
the
draft
board
that
he
would
be
away.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
if
it
please
the
court,
he
did
not
but
he
did
advice
them
that
he
would
in
fact
furnish
addresses
if
it
please
the
court
and
i
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
he
did,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
notice
was
sent
on
the
17th
day
of
january
1966
and
the
draft
board
properly,
promptly
rather
on
january
24,
1966
sent
an
induction
notice
to
him
ordering
him
to
in
fact
report
for
induction
on
the
9th
day
of
february
1966.
this
notice
was
in
fact
received
by
a
person
other
than
the
applicant.
it
was
received
by
his
mother.
additionally,
i
indicate
for
the
record
that
it
was
received
at
an
address
other
than
the
address
that
it
was
sent
to.
it
was
sent
to
10
foulk
road.
it
was
received
not
by
the
applic
--
by
the
appellant
but
by
the
mother
of
the
appellant
and
further
than
that
it
was
received
at
an
address
other
than
the
address
of
the
appellant.
i
submit
that
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
no.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
the
board
did
in
fact
send
it
to
the
correct
address
if
it
please
the
court.
it
was
received
by
another
person
at
a
different
address
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
no.
no
sir,
i
am
not
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
the
facts
briefly,
your
honor,
that
the
communication
was
in
fact
addressed
to
the
appellant
at
10
foulk
road
and
that
the
same
was
in
fact
received
by
a
person
other
than
the
appellant
and
that
the
return
receipt
received
by
the
draft
board
indicated
that
it
was
received
at
a
post
office
box,
post
office
box
10,
if
it
please
the
court
but
a
different
address.
i
submit
further
that
we
are
in
compliance
with
the
so-called
bartchy
case.
and
this
matter,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
feel
is
of
great
significance
because
this
particular
appellant
has
in
fact
done
everything
he
could
and
i
feel
that
the
--
i
agree
with
the
case
law
of
this
country
that
a
person
has
a
duty
to
remain
in
compliance
with
the
law
and
i
submit
that
we
did
not
anticipate
any
draft
notice
that
the
appellant
did
in
fact
notify
the
draft
board
in
advance
of
his
departure.
subsequent
thereto,
he
notified
the
draft
board
from
mexico.
the
transcript
will
indicate
that
he
was
not
aware
of
the
issuance
or
acceptance
of
the
induction
notice
until
he
returned
to
the
united
states
sometime
after
he
was
due
for
induction.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
the
--
the
--
he
advised
them
as
to
an
address
in
mexico
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
if
it
please
the
court.
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
the
communication
listed
his
address
for
the
time
being,
as
listed
the
carlos
veracruz,
mexico.
it
also
contains
a
request
for
a
new
draft
con
to
facilitate
his
return
to
the
united
states.
the
--
i
feel
that
we
have
in
fact
in
good
faith
adhered
to
the
regulations
the
defendant's
actions
clearly
show
an
intent
to
comply
and
not
in
an
intent
to
fail
to
comply.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
cites
a
number
of
cases,
with
most
this
cases,
i
agree.
but
i
submit
that
none
of
these
cases
permit
conviction
and
sentence
without
definite
knowledge,
culpable
knowledge.
this
is
not
a
case
where
we're
attacking
classification.
it's
one
that
very
simply
stated
if
it
please
this
most
honorable
court,
we
never
received
a
notice.
i
submit
that
all
of
the
appellant's
conduct
should
in
fact
be
taken
into
consideration
for
determination
of
whether
or
not
he
is
in
fact
guilty
as
charged.
and
while
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
no,
if
it
please
the
court.
i
filed
at
the
trial,
i
filed
a
plea
of
not
guilty
certainly
and
i
filed
the
subsequent
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
the
record
if
it
please
the
court,
i
feel
is
replete
of
testimony
from
both
sides
and
i'd
like
to
deviate
for
a
moment
to
explain
that
if
it
please
the
court.
the
record
will
indicate
that
this
appellant
has
in
fact
treated
psychiatrists
and
psychologists
since
the
age
of
four.
i've
produced
qualified
psychiatrists
in
the
state
of
rhode
island
and
i
moved
that
the
federal
district
judge
for
the
district
of
rhode
island
permit
the
defendant
in
that
case
and
appellant
here
to
in
fact
be
examined.
this
motion
of
mine
was
in
fact
denied
by
the
trial
justice.
subsequent
thereto,
the
appellant
was
in
fact
examined
by
three
psychiatrists,
members
of
the
united
states
navy
and
was
found
unfit
for
military
service.
the
report
of
the
attending
physicians
is
contained
in
trial
transcript
and
before
this
case
begin
if
it
please
the
court.
the
trial
justice
knew
because
he
had
the
report
on
the
record
that
this
young
man
was
in
fact
unfit
and
had
in
fact
been
declared
unfit
by
psychiatrist
of
this
united
states
navy.
the
prosecution
and
defense
psychiatrist
certainly
differed
as
to
the
extent
of
the
insanity.
however,
i
submit
to
this
honorable
court
that
both
sides
found
that
there
was
in
fact
an
emotional
disturbance.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
if
it
please
the
court,
at
the
particular
time
the
jurisdiction
in
rhode
island
was
following
this
so-called
m'naghten
rule.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
if
it
please
the
court,
at
the
trial
level,
it
was
a
clearly
a
straight
criminal
defense
and
i
filed
a
straight
criminal
defense
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
--
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
the
m'naghten
test
was
in
fact
applicable
at
that
time.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
i
requested
the
trial
justice
to
give
to
me
a
charge
under
the
american
law
institute
rule.
the
charge
was
in
fact
given
exactly
as
requested,
the
american
law
institute
rule.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
but
my
psychiatrist
if
it
please
the
court
found
that
the
applicant
in
this
case
and
the
defendant
in
that
case
was
in
fact
insane.
that
was
his
conclusion.
the
examining
psychiatrist
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
for
the
court
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
if
it
please
the
court,
the
transcript
would
indicate
that
as
far
as
military
suitability
goes,
he
testified
clearly
that
the
defendant
--
appellant
was
not
suitable.
he
also
have
said
that
in
his
opinion
that
the
defendant
in
that
case,
appellant
in
his
case
was
not
--
or
competent.
the
united
states
navy
if
it
please
the
court,
the
transcript
would
in
fact
indicate
that
they
found
him
unfit
for
military
service
from
a
military
point
of
view
and
even
though
they
had
but
one
hour
to
examine
this
young
man
and
the
transcript
would
indicate
that
there
were
many
areas
that
were
in
fact
touched
upon.
they
felt
that
there
was
in
fact
an
existence,
a
chronic
emotional
disturbance
with
long
standing
if
it
please
the
court.
the
trial
justice
did
in
fact
grant
to
me
my
request
for
charge
under
the
american
law
institute
thereby
making
the
ali
rule,
the
lore
of
that
case
while
the
lore
of
the
jurisdiction
remained
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
in
effect,
yes
your
honor.
the
--
i
feel
that
the
transcript
would
in
fact
and
does
in
fact
bear
out
the
position
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i'll
address
myself
to
that
immediately.
if
it
please
the
court,
in
the
ordinary
criminal
case,
many
things
happen.
the
united
states
attorney
had
in
fact
argued
against
me
in
my
motion
to
have
the
then
defendant
now
appellant
examined
as
to
suitability.
subsequent
thereto,
he
was
in
fact
examined
at
the
united
states
naval
hospital
at
new
port
and
we
had
between
us
a
report
that
indicated
clearly
unsuitability
for
service.
i
went
on
the
record
if
it
please
the
court
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
so
advice
the
trial
justice.
and
the
transcript
will
in
fact
indicate
that
the
--
and
i
construe
the
remarks
of
the
assistant
--
united
states
attorney
as
in
fact
being
a
motion
to
either
dismiss
or
a
motion
to
postpone.
the
trial
justice
did
not
in
fact
recognize
it
as
a
motion
to
in
fact
dismiss.
i
concede
and
i
agree
that
this
is
a
discretionary
matter
with
the
trial
justice.
however,
i
submit
that
its
error
for
him
to
fail
to
recognize
it
as
such
a
motion.
additionally,
in
that
the
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
had
in
fact
put
in
issue.
and
the
fact
that
the
united
states
attorney
did
in
fact
indicate
that
--
and
clearly
indicated
on
the
record
that
the
appellant
then
defendant
was
in
fact
willing
to
submit
for
induction
at
that
particular
time.
and
i
ask
the
court
to
bear
that
in
mind
that
the
transcript
does
in
fact
indicate
it
from
the
lips
of
the
united
states
attorney
came,
the
words
in
that
he
is
in
fact
willing
to
report
for
induction.
we
feel
no
further
prosecution
was
in
order
whereupon
the
trial
justice
indicated.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
no.
if
it
please
the
court,
very
briefly,
my
--
i
file
my
own
circuit
motion
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
if
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
it
is
not
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
the
examination
had
already
been
accomplished
at
that
time
and
the
trial
justice
well
knew
the
findings
of
the
three
navy
psychiatrists
at
that
time,
if
it
please
the
court.
this
was
immediately
before
trial.
we
went
to
trial
approximately
two
minutes
later.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
solicitor
general.
very
briefly
if
it
please
the
court,
with
reference
to
this
motion
to
continue,
i
wish
to
make
it
crystal
clear
to
this
court
that
there
was
absolutely
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
i
was
going
to
a
trial
immediately.
and
i
would
like
the
court
to
notice
that
i
was
brave
enough
to
have
this
put
on
the
record
if
it
please
the
court
and
i'm
certain
that
all
being
practitioners,
we've
been
before
a
court
and
it
doesn't
very
frankly
take
too
much
powers
observations
to
know
when
you're
going
to
trial
and
when
you
are
not
going
to
trial.
now,
i
indicate
also
for
the
record,
the
solicitor
general
has
in
fact
read
these
communications
that
i've
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
i
indicate
to
the
court
that
now
--
clearly,
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
my
additional
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
was
clearly
necessary
under
those
circumstances.
i
think
that
the
record
will
indicate
the
accuracy
of
the
plea.
i
know
that
insanity,
defensive
insanity
was
applicable
here.
the
solicitor
general
does
in
fact
concede,
it
would
appear
to
me
that
the
young
man
had
no
notice.
he
indicates
that
this
young
man
failed
to
show
for
physical
examinations.
i
submit
to
the
court
the
he
wasn't
on
trial
for
failing
to
report
for
physical
examinations.
i
concede
that.
he
was
charged
with
not
reporting
for
induction.
initially,
the
--
additionally
the
solicitor
general
concedes
that
the
notice
that
the
then
appellant
--
defendant
now
upon
it
received
was
not
one
that
contained
notice
of
immediate
induction
into
the
armed
forces.
i
submit
that
it's
very
important
to
realize
that
all
of
this
boy's
conduct
should
in
fact
be
taken
into
consideration.
did
he
or
did
he
not
comply
with
the
requirements
as
laid
out
in
the
bartchy
case.
the
--
to
the
best
of
my
humble
knowledge,
there
is
no
statute,
there's
no
case
law
in
existence
in
this
country
that
will
find
someone
guilty
and
sentence
him
and
this
young
boy
is
under
sentenced
to
two
years
in
a
federal
prison.
and
i
submit
that
there's
no
statute
or
no
case
in
existence
in
the
united
states
that
will
charge,
try
and
convict
somebody
and
sentence
them
for
an
offense
committed
that
they
didn't
know
about.
i
submit
that
factually
that
the
solicitor
general
is
incorrect
when
he
says,
“whilst
you
have
to
do
to
avoid
the
draft
is
to
send
some
ridiculous
letter
and
i
say
ridiculous
letter
such
as
my
client
sent
and
leave
town.”
this
is
not
true.
it
is
necessary
clearly
to
adhere
to
the
requirements
of
the
so-called
bartchy
case.
this
country
will
not
permit
one
to
avoid
military
service
in
this
manner.
it
is
necessary.
i
feel
that
when
a
man
does
not
in
fact
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
bartchy
case,
put
him
in
jail
but
when
he
does
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
bartchy
case,
i
feel
clearly
your
honors
that
he
should
--
that
the
convictions
should
in
fact
be
reversed
and
the
young
man
should
be
set
free.
i
trust
that
i
have
shown
that
he
did
in
fact
complied
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
i
do
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
truly
do.
i
feel
that
and
it
--
i'm
well
aware
if
it
please
the
court
that
you
personally
have
try
insanity
cases,
i
know
that.
i
would
ask
this
court
to
take
into
consideration
of
my
client.
i
have
--
you
take
you're
plaintiffs
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes
i
am
if
it
please
the
court.
there
are
other
cases
in
this
area
that
--
or
the
government
cited
graves
versus
the
united
states
at
252
f.2d
878,
in
that
case
somebody
was
off
tending
bees
if
it
please
the
court.
he
thought
that
he
have
a
30-day
con
--
delay
for
reporting.
he
requested
a
60-day
delay
and
left.
he
was
living
in
his
automobile
or
whatnot.
he
was
off
tending
his
fees
and
his
mother
also
received
that
draft
notice.
i
submit
that
this
young
boy
did
not
have
any
knowledge,
any
prior
knowledge
that
any
communication
was
in
fact
coming
to
him.
the
solicitor
general
indicates
that
his
last
communication
did
not
indicate
immediate
contact
for
the
draft
board.
bartchy,
in
the
bartchy
case,
if
it
please
the
court,
it
indicates
clearly
that
you
must
be
expecting
this.
this
young
man
had
no
idea
that
the
united
states
army
wanted
him.
additionally,
he
did
in
fact
send
them
notice
such
as
it
was.
he
sent
them
notice
on
prior
occasions,
on
subsequent
occasions
also.
and
if
it
please
the
court,
i
indicated
for
the
record
when
i
begin
my
argument.
the
first
thing
that
this
young
man
did
after
registering
for
the
draft
was
to
advise
them
way
back
in
1963
if
it
please
the
court
that
he
was
leaving
to
go
to
tennessee.
i
feel
that
his
actions
must
be
considered
as
a
whole.
i
submit
that
his
actions
although
he
may
not
have
sent
him
an
address,
i
will
be
at
xyz
street,
apartment
4,
etcetera.
he
did
in
fact
then
--
provide
them
with
the
best
possible
information
he
could
in
fact
provide.
and
i
submit
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
i
have
nothing
factual
if
it
please
the
court
to
back
up
what
i
say.
i
submit
that
he
very
probably
should
have
been
charged
by
the
united
states
attorney
for
a
violation
of
that
section
of
the
selective
service
law
and
i
--
the
only
thing
i
can
do
if
it
please
the
court
is
to
indicate
that
my
personal
reason
--
explanation
of
why
he
didn't
show
up,
i
submit
that
he
was
sick.
that's
why
i
filed
the
defense
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
if
it
please
the
court.
and
clearly
while
the
navy
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
all
of
his
conduct
should
be
taken
into
consideration
but
i
submit
that
no
more
emphasis
should
be
placed
on
the
bad,
the
ridiculous,
the
foolish
then
--
his
other
attempts
if
it
please
the
court
and
his
other
activities.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon,
if
it
please
the
court?
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
having
my
--
i
want
to
thank
this
court
for
allowing
me
the
opportunity.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
distinguished
justices
of
the
honorable
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
i
would
like
to
indicate
at
the
outset
for
the
record
that
i
would
like
to
allocate
my
time
in
20
minutes
for
argument
and
reserve
10
minutes
if
possible
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
also
for
the
record
indicate
that
i
was
assisted
and
i
truly
appreciate
the
help
from
the
solicitor
of
this
court,
john
knotty,
iii
of
rhode
island.
the
petitioner
if
it
please
the
court
is
under
sentence
at
the
present
time
to
a
term
of
two
years,
an
institution
to
be
decided
by
the
united
states
attorney
general.
he
was
charged,
tried
and
convicted
first
in
the
district
of
rhode
island
in
the
federal
district
court
for
a
willful
failure
and
a
knowing
failure
to
report
for
induction
at
the
military
forces
of
the
united
states.
the
trouble
of
the
case
i
feel
is
accurately
cited
in
the
brief
for
petitioner
and
i
submit
to
the
court
that
perhaps
the
crowning
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
defendant
in
that
case
and
the
appellant
here
did
in
fact
have
noticed
of
the
draft
notice
itself.
the
record
i
feel
is
replete
of
testimony
that
would
clearly
indicate
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
philip
jerome
stiles
did
not
in
fact
receive
a
notice
that
was
sent
to
him
by
the
draft
board
from
westerly,
rhode
island.
the
first
contact
of
the
petitioner
had
with
the
selective
service
system
of
the
united
states
occurred
on
the
18th
day
of
april
1963
wherein
he
filled
down
his
application
pursuant
to
the
regulations.
i
indicate
to
chief
justice
and
your
honorable
justices
of
this
court
that
his
first
communication
with
them
subsequent
thereto
was
on
05/17/1963
wherein
the
petitioner's
case
advised
his
local
selective
service
draft
board
that
he
would
in
fact
be
in
the
state
of
tennessee
and
the
transcript
will
indicate
that
this
was
received
by
the
local
draft
board
on
the
20th
day
of
may
1963.
the
matter
of
notice
relative
to
a
receipt
of
draft
notices
has
in
fact
been
discussed
on
the
case
of
bartchy
versus
the
united
states
and
i
submit
that
this
is
a
very
important
case.
the
case
does
indicate
that
the
defendant
does
have
a
duty
to
promptly
advice
his
draft
board
of
his
address
but
the
case
indicates
that
he
is
not.
in
fact
the
client
remained
in
one
place
provided
even
he
is
in
fact
anticipating
the
arrival
of
a
draft
notice.
i
submit
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
did
not
in
fact
anticipate
a
draft
notice.
i
must
admit
and
i
do
admit
that
the
petition
in
this
case
directed
communications
to
the
local
draft
board
that
contained
a
language
that
was
less
than
desirable
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
recipient.
however,
the
defendant
did
in
fact
and
the
appellant
in
this
case
did
in
fact
notified
his
draft
board
that
he
would
in
fact
not
be
at
the
address
that
was
listed
on
his
papers
in
the
custody
of
the
draft
board
and
subsequent
thereto
he
was
sent
an
induction
notice
but
the
draft
board.
he
notified
them
by
letter
on
january
17,
1966
and
he
advised
the
draft
board
that
he
would
be
away.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
if
it
please
the
court,
he
did
not
but
he
did
advice
them
that
he
would
in
fact
furnish
addresses
if
it
please
the
court
and
i
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
he
did,
if
it
please
the
court.
the
notice
was
sent
on
the
17th
day
of
january
1966
and
the
draft
board
properly,
promptly
rather
on
january
24,
1966
sent
an
induction
notice
to
him
ordering
him
to
in
fact
report
for
induction
on
the
9th
day
of
february
1966.
this
notice
was
in
fact
received
by
a
person
other
than
the
applicant.
it
was
received
by
his
mother.
additionally,
i
indicate
for
the
record
that
it
was
received
at
an
address
other
than
the
address
that
it
was
sent
to.
it
was
sent
to
10
foulk
road.
it
was
received
not
by
the
applic
--
by
the
appellant
but
by
the
mother
of
the
appellant
and
further
than
that
it
was
received
at
an
address
other
than
the
address
of
the
appellant.
i
submit
that
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
no.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
the
board
did
in
fact
send
it
to
the
correct
address
if
it
please
the
court.
it
was
received
by
another
person
at
a
different
address
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
no.
no
sir,
i
am
not
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
the
facts
briefly,
your
honor,
that
the
communication
was
in
fact
addressed
to
the
appellant
at
10
foulk
road
and
that
the
same
was
in
fact
received
by
a
person
other
than
the
appellant
and
that
the
return
receipt
received
by
the
draft
board
indicated
that
it
was
received
at
a
post
office
box,
post
office
box
10,
if
it
please
the
court
but
a
different
address.
i
submit
further
that
we
are
in
compliance
with
the
so-called
bartchy
case.
and
this
matter,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
feel
is
of
great
significance
because
this
particular
appellant
has
in
fact
done
everything
he
could
and
i
feel
that
the
--
i
agree
with
the
case
law
of
this
country
that
a
person
has
a
duty
to
remain
in
compliance
with
the
law
and
i
submit
that
we
did
not
anticipate
any
draft
notice
that
the
appellant
did
in
fact
notify
the
draft
board
in
advance
of
his
departure.
subsequent
thereto,
he
notified
the
draft
board
from
mexico.
the
transcript
will
indicate
that
he
was
not
aware
of
the
issuance
or
acceptance
of
the
induction
notice
until
he
returned
to
the
united
states
sometime
after
he
was
due
for
induction.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
the
--
the
--
he
advised
them
as
to
an
address
in
mexico
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
if
it
please
the
court.
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
the
communication
listed
his
address
for
the
time
being,
as
listed
the
carlos
veracruz,
mexico.
it
also
contains
a
request
for
a
new
draft
con
to
facilitate
his
return
to
the
united
states.
the
--
i
feel
that
we
have
in
fact
in
good
faith
adhered
to
the
regulations
the
defendant's
actions
clearly
show
an
intent
to
comply
and
not
in
an
intent
to
fail
to
comply.
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
cites
a
number
of
cases,
with
most
this
cases,
i
agree.
but
i
submit
that
none
of
these
cases
permit
conviction
and
sentence
without
definite
knowledge,
culpable
knowledge.
this
is
not
a
case
where
we're
attacking
classification.
it's
one
that
very
simply
stated
if
it
please
this
most
honorable
court,
we
never
received
a
notice.
i
submit
that
all
of
the
appellant's
conduct
should
in
fact
be
taken
into
consideration
for
determination
of
whether
or
not
he
is
in
fact
guilty
as
charged.
and
while
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
no,
if
it
please
the
court.
i
filed
at
the
trial,
i
filed
a
plea
of
not
guilty
certainly
and
i
filed
the
subsequent
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
the
record
if
it
please
the
court,
i
feel
is
replete
of
testimony
from
both
sides
and
i'd
like
to
deviate
for
a
moment
to
explain
that
if
it
please
the
court.
the
record
will
indicate
that
this
appellant
has
in
fact
treated
psychiatrists
and
psychologists
since
the
age
of
four.
i've
produced
qualified
psychiatrists
in
the
state
of
rhode
island
and
i
moved
that
the
federal
district
judge
for
the
district
of
rhode
island
permit
the
defendant
in
that
case
and
appellant
here
to
in
fact
be
examined.
this
motion
of
mine
was
in
fact
denied
by
the
trial
justice.
subsequent
thereto,
the
appellant
was
in
fact
examined
by
three
psychiatrists,
members
of
the
united
states
navy
and
was
found
unfit
for
military
service.
the
report
of
the
attending
physicians
is
contained
in
trial
transcript
and
before
this
case
begin
if
it
please
the
court.
the
trial
justice
knew
because
he
had
the
report
on
the
record
that
this
young
man
was
in
fact
unfit
and
had
in
fact
been
declared
unfit
by
psychiatrist
of
this
united
states
navy.
the
prosecution
and
defense
psychiatrist
certainly
differed
as
to
the
extent
of
the
insanity.
however,
i
submit
to
this
honorable
court
that
both
sides
found
that
there
was
in
fact
an
emotional
disturbance.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
if
it
please
the
court,
at
the
particular
time
the
jurisdiction
in
rhode
island
was
following
this
so-called
m'naghten
rule.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
if
it
please
the
court,
at
the
trial
level,
it
was
a
clearly
a
straight
criminal
defense
and
i
filed
a
straight
criminal
defense
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
--
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
the
m'naghten
test
was
in
fact
applicable
at
that
time.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
i
requested
the
trial
justice
to
give
to
me
a
charge
under
the
american
law
institute
rule.
the
charge
was
in
fact
given
exactly
as
requested,
the
american
law
institute
rule.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
but
my
psychiatrist
if
it
please
the
court
found
that
the
applicant
in
this
case
and
the
defendant
in
that
case
was
in
fact
insane.
that
was
his
conclusion.
the
examining
psychiatrist
and
i
would
like
to
emphasize
for
the
court
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
the
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
if
it
please
the
court,
the
transcript
would
indicate
that
as
far
as
military
suitability
goes,
he
testified
clearly
that
the
defendant
--
appellant
was
not
suitable.
he
also
have
said
that
in
his
opinion
that
the
defendant
in
that
case,
appellant
in
his
case
was
not
--
or
competent.
the
united
states
navy
if
it
please
the
court,
the
transcript
would
in
fact
indicate
that
they
found
him
unfit
for
military
service
from
a
military
point
of
view
and
even
though
they
had
but
one
hour
to
examine
this
young
man
and
the
transcript
would
indicate
that
there
were
many
areas
that
were
in
fact
touched
upon.
they
felt
that
there
was
in
fact
an
existence,
a
chronic
emotional
disturbance
with
long
standing
if
it
please
the
court.
the
trial
justice
did
in
fact
grant
to
me
my
request
for
charge
under
the
american
law
institute
thereby
making
the
ali
rule,
the
lore
of
that
case
while
the
lore
of
the
jurisdiction
remained
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
in
effect,
yes
your
honor.
the
--
i
feel
that
the
transcript
would
in
fact
and
does
in
fact
bear
out
the
position
if
it
please
the
court.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i'll
address
myself
to
that
immediately.
if
it
please
the
court,
in
the
ordinary
criminal
case,
many
things
happen.
the
united
states
attorney
had
in
fact
argued
against
me
in
my
motion
to
have
the
then
defendant
now
appellant
examined
as
to
suitability.
subsequent
thereto,
he
was
in
fact
examined
at
the
united
states
naval
hospital
at
new
port
and
we
had
between
us
a
report
that
indicated
clearly
unsuitability
for
service.
i
went
on
the
record
if
it
please
the
court
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury
and
so
advice
the
trial
justice.
and
the
transcript
will
in
fact
indicate
that
the
--
and
i
construe
the
remarks
of
the
assistant
--
united
states
attorney
as
in
fact
being
a
motion
to
either
dismiss
or
a
motion
to
postpone.
the
trial
justice
did
not
in
fact
recognize
it
as
a
motion
to
in
fact
dismiss.
i
concede
and
i
agree
that
this
is
a
discretionary
matter
with
the
trial
justice.
however,
i
submit
that
its
error
for
him
to
fail
to
recognize
it
as
such
a
motion.
additionally,
in
that
the
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
had
in
fact
put
in
issue.
and
the
fact
that
the
united
states
attorney
did
in
fact
indicate
that
--
and
clearly
indicated
on
the
record
that
the
appellant
then
defendant
was
in
fact
willing
to
submit
for
induction
at
that
particular
time.
and
i
ask
the
court
to
bear
that
in
mind
that
the
transcript
does
in
fact
indicate
it
from
the
lips
of
the
united
states
attorney
came,
the
words
in
that
he
is
in
fact
willing
to
report
for
induction.
we
feel
no
further
prosecution
was
in
order
whereupon
the
trial
justice
indicated.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
no.
if
it
please
the
court,
very
briefly,
my
--
i
file
my
own
circuit
motion
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
if
it
please
the
court
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
it
is
not
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
the
examination
had
already
been
accomplished
at
that
time
and
the
trial
justice
well
knew
the
findings
of
the
three
navy
psychiatrists
at
that
time,
if
it
please
the
court.
this
was
immediately
before
trial.
we
went
to
trial
approximately
two
minutes
later.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
solicitor
general.
very
briefly
if
it
please
the
court,
with
reference
to
this
motion
to
continue,
i
wish
to
make
it
crystal
clear
to
this
court
that
there
was
absolutely
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
i
was
going
to
a
trial
immediately.
and
i
would
like
the
court
to
notice
that
i
was
brave
enough
to
have
this
put
on
the
record
if
it
please
the
court
and
i'm
certain
that
all
being
practitioners,
we've
been
before
a
court
and
it
doesn't
very
frankly
take
too
much
powers
observations
to
know
when
you're
going
to
trial
and
when
you
are
not
going
to
trial.
now,
i
indicate
also
for
the
record,
the
solicitor
general
has
in
fact
read
these
communications
that
i've
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court
and
i
indicate
to
the
court
that
now
--
clearly,
there's
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
my
additional
plea
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
was
clearly
necessary
under
those
circumstances.
i
think
that
the
record
will
indicate
the
accuracy
of
the
plea.
i
know
that
insanity,
defensive
insanity
was
applicable
here.
the
solicitor
general
does
in
fact
concede,
it
would
appear
to
me
that
the
young
man
had
no
notice.
he
indicates
that
this
young
man
failed
to
show
for
physical
examinations.
i
submit
to
the
court
the
he
wasn't
on
trial
for
failing
to
report
for
physical
examinations.
i
concede
that.
he
was
charged
with
not
reporting
for
induction.
initially,
the
--
additionally
the
solicitor
general
concedes
that
the
notice
that
the
then
appellant
--
defendant
now
upon
it
received
was
not
one
that
contained
notice
of
immediate
induction
into
the
armed
forces.
i
submit
that
it's
very
important
to
realize
that
all
of
this
boy's
conduct
should
in
fact
be
taken
into
consideration.
did
he
or
did
he
not
comply
with
the
requirements
as
laid
out
in
the
bartchy
case.
the
--
to
the
best
of
my
humble
knowledge,
there
is
no
statute,
there's
no
case
law
in
existence
in
this
country
that
will
find
someone
guilty
and
sentence
him
and
this
young
boy
is
under
sentenced
to
two
years
in
a
federal
prison.
and
i
submit
that
there's
no
statute
or
no
case
in
existence
in
the
united
states
that
will
charge,
try
and
convict
somebody
and
sentence
them
for
an
offense
committed
that
they
didn't
know
about.
i
submit
that
factually
that
the
solicitor
general
is
incorrect
when
he
says,
“whilst
you
have
to
do
to
avoid
the
draft
is
to
send
some
ridiculous
letter
and
i
say
ridiculous
letter
such
as
my
client
sent
and
leave
town.”
this
is
not
true.
it
is
necessary
clearly
to
adhere
to
the
requirements
of
the
so-called
bartchy
case.
this
country
will
not
permit
one
to
avoid
military
service
in
this
manner.
it
is
necessary.
i
feel
that
when
a
man
does
not
in
fact
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
bartchy
case,
put
him
in
jail
but
when
he
does
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
bartchy
case,
i
feel
clearly
your
honors
that
he
should
--
that
the
convictions
should
in
fact
be
reversed
and
the
young
man
should
be
set
free.
i
trust
that
i
have
shown
that
he
did
in
fact
complied
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
i
do
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
truly
do.
i
feel
that
and
it
--
i'm
well
aware
if
it
please
the
court
that
you
personally
have
try
insanity
cases,
i
know
that.
i
would
ask
this
court
to
take
into
consideration
of
my
client.
i
have
--
you
take
you're
plaintiffs
your
honor
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes
i
am
if
it
please
the
court.
there
are
other
cases
in
this
area
that
--
or
the
government
cited
graves
versus
the
united
states
at
252
f.2d
878,
in
that
case
somebody
was
off
tending
bees
if
it
please
the
court.
he
thought
that
he
have
a
30-day
con
--
delay
for
reporting.
he
requested
a
60-day
delay
and
left.
he
was
living
in
his
automobile
or
whatnot.
he
was
off
tending
his
fees
and
his
mother
also
received
that
draft
notice.
i
submit
that
this
young
boy
did
not
have
any
knowledge,
any
prior
knowledge
that
any
communication
was
in
fact
coming
to
him.
the
solicitor
general
indicates
that
his
last
communication
did
not
indicate
immediate
contact
for
the
draft
board.
bartchy,
in
the
bartchy
case,
if
it
please
the
court,
it
indicates
clearly
that
you
must
be
expecting
this.
this
young
man
had
no
idea
that
the
united
states
army
wanted
him.
additionally,
he
did
in
fact
send
them
notice
such
as
it
was.
he
sent
them
notice
on
prior
occasions,
on
subsequent
occasions
also.
and
if
it
please
the
court,
i
indicated
for
the
record
when
i
begin
my
argument.
the
first
thing
that
this
young
man
did
after
registering
for
the
draft
was
to
advise
them
way
back
in
1963
if
it
please
the
court
that
he
was
leaving
to
go
to
tennessee.
i
feel
that
his
actions
must
be
considered
as
a
whole.
i
submit
that
his
actions
although
he
may
not
have
sent
him
an
address,
i
will
be
at
xyz
street,
apartment
4,
etcetera.
he
did
in
fact
then
--
provide
them
with
the
best
possible
information
he
could
in
fact
provide.
and
i
submit
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
i
have
nothing
factual
if
it
please
the
court
to
back
up
what
i
say.
i
submit
that
he
very
probably
should
have
been
charged
by
the
united
states
attorney
for
a
violation
of
that
section
of
the
selective
service
law
and
i
--
the
only
thing
i
can
do
if
it
please
the
court
is
to
indicate
that
my
personal
reason
--
explanation
of
why
he
didn't
show
up,
i
submit
that
he
was
sick.
that's
why
i
filed
the
defense
of
not
guilty
by
reason
of
insanity
if
it
please
the
court.
and
clearly
while
the
navy
--
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
all
of
his
conduct
should
be
taken
into
consideration
but
i
submit
that
no
more
emphasis
should
be
placed
on
the
bad,
the
ridiculous,
the
foolish
then
--
his
other
attempts
if
it
please
the
court
and
his
other
activities.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
i
beg
your
pardon,
if
it
please
the
court?
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
having
my
--
i
want
to
thank
this
court
for
allowing
me
the
opportunity.
mr.
charles
j.
rogers,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
