justice
thurgood
marshall
assuming
all
that
to
be
true
and
it
could
be
increased
in
the
future,
about
when
do
you
expect
to
get
desegregation
in
montgomery
county,
about
when?
justice
thurgood
marshall
will
it
be
after
these
children
have
graduated?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
you
think
it
will
be
later
than
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
long
did
it
take
you
to
reach
this
place
since
1954?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
didn't
volunteer
to
that
program
that
judge
johnson
put
it
on
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
you
were
left
alone,
you
wouldn't
move
it
all
the
way.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
if
we
change
in
time
to
do
these
petitioners
any
good?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
when
you
get
these
faculties
desegregated
before
the
present
elementary
school
students
graduated.
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
what
basis?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
tell
judge
johnson
that?
has
this
come
after
his
holding,
you
talked
about
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
should
ask
judge
johnson
to
change
his
order?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
did
you
asked
him
to
modify
and
give
you
some
more
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
phelps,
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
you're
--
if
this
court
asked
you
for
more
time
and
all.
did
you
ask
judge
johnson
for
the
same
thing
you're
now
asking
us
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
long
will
that
take?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
before
these
children
graduate,
there
will
be
no
faculty
in
montgomery
county
that
will
be
racially
identifiable.
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
what
percentage?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
not
talking
to
educators
about
race.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
not
talking
to
educators
about
race.
i
said
to
a
faculty
that
is
not
racially
identifiable.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
assume
--
i
assume
that
the
all
of
the
white
teachers
and
all
of
the
negro
teachers
of
montgomery
county
are
equally
qualified.
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
talk
about
qualified
now,
i
thought
they
won't
qualify.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
mean
that
some
teachers
are
unqualified
to
teach
children
of
another
race?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
doubt
that
a
science
teacher
teaching
the
junior
high
school
isn't
capable
to
teach
in
kindergarten.
i
assume
so,
i'm
talking
about
equally
qualified
teachers,
equally
qualified
race,
equally
qualified
subjects.
you
say
that
some
are
qualified
and
some
are
not.
now,
take
seventh
grade
elementary
school
teachers,
what
is
the
difference
in
their
qualification?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--
judge
johnson
to
all
that
it
should
be
shifted
from
one
level
of
education
to
the
other.
he
doesn't
say
anything
like
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
says
if
you
got
a
hundred
teachers
in
the
seventh
grade
elementary
school,
you
divide
them
up,
period.
he
didn't
say
move
them
from
seventh
to
high
school.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
what
anybody
said
except
judge
johnson.
justice
thurgood
marshall
his
words
weren't.
justice
thurgood
marshall
filed
a
petition
to
stay
after
you
filed
an
appeal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
made
no
effort
to
bring
any
of
this
before
judge
johnson?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
if
they
integrated
all
of
the
students
of
all
of
the
schools,
they
wouldn't
have
any
of
the
problems?
justice
thurgood
marshall
1954
to
date,
it
made
6%
progress.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
phelps,
do
you
have
the
exact
same
books,
regular
subject
matter,
equipment
in
both
schools?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what's
the
problem
with
transferring
the
general
science
teacher
in
a
predominantly
white
school
to
the
general
science
teacher
in
the
negro
school,
since
they
have
everything
exactly
the
same?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
have
to
start
some
place.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
i'm
starting
with
the
general
science
teacher,
that's
the
one
you
like
to
talk
about.
the
general
science
teacher
from
one
school
to
the
other
would
be
no
problem,
exact
same
facilities,
exact
same
books,
exact
same
training,
and
exact
same
fee.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
mind,
i
assume
that
in
both
schools,
since
they're
all
the
same
people,
they
all
chose
to
take
general
science.
what's
the
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
where
is
there
that
much
difference
between
these
schools?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
seem
to
always
find
a
problem
here
like
there's
a
difference
in
these
schools.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
case
is
on
here
sir?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
sure
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
is
a
problem.
the
whole
school
system
is
a
problem.
justice
thurgood
marshall
any
school
system
is
a
problem.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
tends
to
be
you
can
solve
every
problem
but
race.
justice
thurgood

assuming
all
