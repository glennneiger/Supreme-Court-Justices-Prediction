mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
school
desegregation
case.
the
question
arises
here
however
with
respect
to
faculty
desegregation
rather
than
directly
with
student
desegregation.
the
issue
is
a
rather
narrow
but
important
one.
it
arises
with
respect
to
the
schools
of
montgomery
county,
alabama
including
not
only
those
in
the
city
of
montgomery
but
also
those
in
the
surrounding
county
area.
for
the
1967-1968
school
year,
the
defendants
operated
52
schools
including
32
predominantly
white
and
20
predominantly
negro
schools.
there
were
approximately
22,500
white
students
and
17,000
negro
students
taught
by
approximately
815
white
teachers
and
550
negro
teachers.
this
suit
began
with
a
complaint
which
was
filed
on
may
11,
1964
almost
five
years
ago.
at
that
time
as
the
district
court
stated
in
its
opinion
and
this
is
at
page
524
of
the
printed
record,
the
montgomery
county
board
of
education
had
taken
no
steps
and
had
made
no
plans
whatsoever
to
comply
with
the
law
of
this
land
in
the
area
of
school
desegregation
even
though
ten
years
had
passed
when
this
matter
came
on
for
a
hearing
in
1964,
the
montgomery
county
board
of
education
was
allowed
by
this
court
to
proceed
with
desegregation
gradually
for
the
reason
that
it
was
realized
that
desegregation
of
the
public
schools
cut
across
the
social
fabric
of
this
community
and
that
there
would
be
both
administrative
and
other
practical
problems
for
the
board
to
cope
with.
and
the
court
went
on
to
show
the
way
in
which
it
had
helped
to
cooperate
with
the
board
and
moving
forward
in
this
and
concluded
however
we
have
reached
the
point
where
we
must
pass
tokenism
and
the
order
that
was
entered
in
this
case
on
february
24,
1968
is
designed
to
accomplish
this
purpose.
it
was
not
designed
to
and
was
not
intended
to
accomplish
and
if
complied
with
will
not
require
more
than
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
the
other
appellate
courts
have
held
must
be
accomplished
in
order
to
desegregate
a
public
school
system.
well,
now
what
had
been
done
since
the
suit
was
filed
in
1964,
in
the
year
1964-65,
as
a
result
of
an
order
of
the
court
entered
on
july
31,
1964,
the
board
permitted
transfers
under
the
alabama
school
placement
law
in
four
grades,
grade
1
and
grades
10,
11,
and
12,
being
the
senior
high
school.
this
order
did
not
affect
the
system
of
initial
assignments
on
the
basis
of
race.
the
board
accepted
eight
of
29
negroes
who
applied
to
transfer
to
traditionally
white
schools.
two
students
withdrew
their
applications
and
the
board
denied
the
remaining
19
applications,
so
that
during
the
first
year,
there
were
eight
negro
students
in
what
had
previously
been
white
schools.
in
1965-66,
grades
1,
2,
7,
and
9
through
12
were
to
be
desegregated,
49
negro
students
applied
to
attend
predominantly
white
schools.
the
defendants
rejected
applications
from
31
of
these
and
accepted
18
applications.
on
appeal
to
the
court,
the
court
overturned
six
of
the
rejections
but
accepted
the
remainder.
this
made
24
students
who
were
admitted
to
the
schools.
in
1966-67,
approximately
330
negro
students
chose
to
attend
white
school
--
traditionally
white
schools
in
montgomery
county,
no
white
students
chose
to
attend
traditionally
negro
schools.
this
was
the
first
year
that
the
school
board
operated
under
a
freedom
of
choice
plan
without
initial
assignment
on
the
basis
of
race
except
in
the
two
grades
which
were
not
yet
covered
by
the
desegregation
plan
which
were
grades
5
and
6.
in
the
year
1967-68
was
the
first
year
that
all
12
grades
were
to
be
formally
desegregated.
approximately,
550
negro
students
attended
traditionally
white
schools.
no
white
students
attended
negro
schools
and
in
the
year
1968-69,
the
current
year,
there
are
approximately
950
negro
students
in
30
traditionally
white
schools
and
approximately
16,500
or
94%
in
all
negro
schools.
there
are
no
white
students
in
negro
schools.
so
that
in
summary,
as
of
today,
no
white
student
has
ever
attended
a
traditionally
negro
school
in
montgomery
county.
the
number
of
negro
students
attending
traditionally
white
schools
has
slowly
increased.
until
the
present
time,
it
is
950
which
seem
like
a
substantial
number
but
it
is
less
than
6%
of
the
negro
students
in
the
montgomery
county
school
system.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
what?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
relevance
mr.
justice
is
to
show
the
slowness
of
the
progress
which
had
occurred
over
four
years
and
the
background
for
the
order
of
the
judge
which
is
under
review
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
--
i'm
turning
now
to
faculty
which
is
the
issue
here.
there
was
complete
segregation
of
faculty
in
the
montgomery
county
public
schools
prior
to
september
1967.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
i
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
cannot.
i
do
not
have
that
information.
mr.
greenberg
may
be
able
to
supply
something
about
that
but
i
do
not
know.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
complaint
in
this
case,
as
i
have
said,
was
filed
on
may
11,
1964.
in
it,
the
plaintiff
sought
faculty
desegregation.
the
court's
first
order
made
no
specific
reference
to
faculty
desegregation
but
it
did
require
the
defendants
to
submit
a
plan
designed
to
eliminate
segregation
of
students
based
upon
race
and
the
complete
elimination
of
the
biracial
school
system
within
a
reasonable
time.
the
defendant's
first
segregation
plan
was
submitted
in
january
1965
and
it
was
sound
as
to
faculty
desegregation.
the
plaintiff's
objected
but
the
court
declined
to
act
beyond
ordering
the
defendants
for
the
second
time
to
submit
a
plan
for
the
complete
elimination
of
the
biracial
school
system
within
a
reasonable
time.
the
defendant's
second
desegregation
plan
was
submitted
in
january
1966
and
it
too
was
sound
as
to
faculty
desegregation.
both
the
plaintiffs
and
the
government
objected.
and
on
march
22nd,
the
district
court,
ordered
the
board
to
adopt
a
desegregation
plan
providing
in
part
and
this
appears
on
page
337
of
the
printed
record
that
race
or
color
will
henceforth
not
be
a
factor
in
the
hiring,
assignment,
reassignment,
promotion,
demotion
or
dismissal
of
teachers
and
other
professional
staff
with
the
exception
that
assignments
shall
be
made
in
order
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
past
discrimination.
teachers,
principals
and
staff
members
will
be
assigned
to
schools
so
that
the
faculty
and
staff
is
not
composed
of
members
of
one
race
and
that
is
a
fine
statement
but
a
completely
general
in
its
terms
and
judge
johnson
at
that
time
stated
from
the
bench
that
i
will
not
expect
too
much
of
it,
meaning
faculty
desegregation
in
september
1966
because
of
the
timing
but
i
will
expect
a
considerable
amount
of
it,
effective
in
september
1967.
however
in
august
of
1966,
following
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
case
involving
the
mobile
schools,
judge
johnson
sua
sponte
declared
that
the
montgomery
board
would
have
the
same
period
available
as
the
court
of
appeals
had
established
for
mobile
and
that
they
would
be
allowed
until
the
school
year
1967-68
to
commence
desegregation
of
the
faculty
and
professional
staff
in
the
montgomery
county
school
system.
at
that
time,
the
defendants
had
tentatively
assigned
four
teachers
of
each
race
to
teach
in
high
schools
attended
predominantly
by
students
of
the
opposite
race
for
the
1966-67
year.
but
after
judge
johnson's
modification
in
august
1966,
these
assignments
were
not
implemented.
on
june
1,
1967,
the
district
court
ordered
the
defendants
to
adopt
a
desegregation
plan
with
faculty
provisions
substantially
similar
to
that
which
it
had
ordered
in
march
1966
but
with
certain
additions.
the
court
indicated
for
the
first
time
that
its
desegregation
order
was
to
extend
to
student
teachers.
also
the
court
directed
and
this
appears
at
page
454
of
the
printed
record,
wherever
possible,
teachers
will
be
assigned
so
that
more
than
one
teacher
of
the
minority
race,
white
or
negro
will
be
on
a
desegregated
faculty.
the
school
board
will
take
positive
and
affirmative
steps
to
accomplish
the
desegregation
of
its
school
faculties
including
substantial
desegregation
of
faculties
in
as
many
of
the
schools
as
possible
for
the
1967-68
school
year
notwithstanding
the
teacher
contracts
for
the
1967-68
or
1968-69
school
year
have
already
been
signed
and
approved.
the
objective
of
the
school
system
is
that
the
pattern
of
teacher
assignment
to
any
particular
school
shall
not
be
identifiable
as
tailored
for
a
heavy
concentration
of
either
negro
or
white
pupils
in
the
school
and
here
again
is
an
excellent
general
statement
with
no
appreciable
specific
standard.
as
a
result
of
which,
the
defendants
assigned
five
teachers
of
each
race
to
schools
predominantly
of
the
opposite
race.
the
10
teachers
taught
only
at
four
high
schools
in
the
city
of
montgomery,
none
in
any
elementary
schools,
none
in
any
of
the
schools
outside
of
the
city
except
that
in
the
elementary
schools,
the
defendants
did
assigned
three
white
speech
therapists
to
teach
in
all
elementary
schools.
on
august
17,
1967,
the
government
objected
to
the
defendant's
failure
to
bring
about
more
faculty
desegregation
and
move
for
further
relief
and
the
plaintiffs
in
the
action
joined
in
the
motion.
there
was
a
hearing
in
september
1967
and
the
superintendent
of
the
montgomery
school
board,
mr.
mckee
explained
the
defendant's
failure
to
assign
desegregating
faculty
members
to
48
of
their
52
schools.
he
said,
we
felt,
there
would
be
less
objection
in
the
senior
high
schools
because
one
teacher
would
not
have
the
pupils
as
much
of
today
as
they
would
in
the
lower
grades.
he
acknowledged
reassigning
over
40
negro
teachers
from
schools
close
pursuant
to
court
order
to
other
negro
schools
for
the
1967-68
school
year.
he
also
acknowledged
assigning
over
90
new
teachers
for
the
1967-68
school
year
to
schools
where
their
race
predominated.
the
court
declined
to
enter
in
a
further
order
in
the
fall
of
1967.
however,
in
january
1968,
the
district
court
set
the
august
1967
motion
of
the
united
states
down
for
a
second
hearing
in
february
1968,
a
little
over
year
ago.
both
the
government
and
the
plaintiffs
filed
a
supplemental
motion
for
further
relief
shortly
before
the
hearing.
in
the
meantime,
the
defendants
had
assigned
six
or
seven
additional
white
teachers
to
three
or
four
more
traditionally
negro
schools,
so
that
seven
or
eight
of
the
52
schools
had
desegregated
facilities.
the
chief
evidence
concerning
desegregation
is
summarized
in
the
district
court's
opinion
of
february
24,
1968.this
is
on
page
493
and
494
of
the
printed
record.
since
the
order
of
this
court
on
june
1,
1967,
judge
johnson
said,
“defendants
have
assigned
or
transferred
approximately
75
new
teachers
to
faculties
where
their
race
was
in
the
majority.
since
the
opening
of
school
in
september
1967,
defendants
have
hired
approximately
32
new
teachers,
26
white
and
6
negro.
of
the
26
new
white
teachers,
only
six
or
seven
have
been
placed
in
predominantly
negro
schools.
all
six
negroes
were
assigned
to
predominantly
negro
schools.”
and
the
judge
went
on
to
say,
“the
defendants
have
adopted
no
adequate
program
for
the
assignment
of
student
teachers
on
a
desegregated
basis.
none
of
the
approximately
150
student
teachers
whose
in
the
montgomery
county
school
system
in
the
fall
of
1967
were
assigned
to
schools
predominantly
of
the
opposite
race.
four
negro
schools
--
four
negro
student
teachers
have
very
recently
been
assigned
to
predominantly
white
schools.
there
has
been
no
faculty
desegregation
in
the
night
schools
operated
by
the
montgomery
county
school
system.”
now,
judge
johnson
could
have
added
that
the
defendants
had
continue
their
policy
of
assigning
negro
teachers
only
to
negro
schools
and
the
two
traditionally
white
senior
high
schools
in
the
city
of
montgomery.
they
had
assigned
no
negro
teachers
to
traditionally
white
elementary
or
junior
high
schools
or
to
a
predominantly
white
senior
high
school
outside
of
montgomery.
no
teacher
was
assigned
to
teach
an
academic
subject
in
a
traditionally
white
school.
superintendent
mckee
testified
that
the
defendants
assigned
white
teachers
to
negro
schools
only
if
the
teachers
expressed
the
willingness
to
teach
there
even
though
the
superintendent
knew
he
testified
that
the
law
did
not
permit
him
to
rely
on
voluntariness.
the
defendants
continued
to
hire
new
white
teachers
whose
application
showed
that
they
would
not
accept
integrated
faculty.
the
defendants
assigned
negro
teachers
to
negro
schools
even
though
they
were
willing
to
teach
at
traditionally
white
schools
because
of
the
defendant's
concern
for
the
reaction
of
white
community
members.
and
so
in
summary,
at
the
time
the
order
with
which
we
are
concerned
was
entered,
prior
to
1967,
there
was
no
faculty
desegregation.
during
1967-68,
32
teachers,
26
white
and
6
negro
out
of
over
1350
were
assigned
to
schools
where
their
race
was
in
the
minority.
four
of
over
300
student
teachers
were
assigned
to
desegregating
positions.
no
negro
substituted
for
a
teacher
in
a
traditionally
white
school.
night
school
facilities
were
segregated;
during
the
year
1968-69,
since
the
order
of
the
court
below,
216
teachers
have
been
assigned
to
desegregating
positions.
now,
in
this
situation,
what
was
the
order
of
judge
johnson?
it
appears
on
pages
503
to
510
of
the
record
but
it
was
then
amended
on
pages
520
to
523
and
i
think
the
most
convenient
place
to
examine
it
is
as
it
is
set
out
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
where
it
is
set
out
with
the
amendments
incorporated
and
that
appears
on
page
754
of
the
record.
it
is
there
exactly
the
same
as
in
the
references
i
previously
gave
except
the
amendments
have
been
read
in.
it
starts
out
on
page
754,
statement
of
objective.
in
achieving
the
objective
of
the
school
system
that
the
pattern
of
teacher
assignments
to
any
particular
school
shall
not
be
identifiable
as
tailored
for
a
heavy
concentration
of
either
negro
or
white
pupils
in
the
school.
the
school
board
will
be
guided
by
the
ratio
of
negro
to
white
faculty
members
in
the
school
system
as
a
whole.
and
that
is
about
60-40,
about
three
to
two,
three
white
to
two
negro.
the
school
board
will
accomplish
faculty
desegregation
by
hiring
and
assigning
faculty
members
so
that
in
each
school,
the
ratio
of
white
to
negro
faculty
members
is
substantially
the
same
as
it
is
throughout
the
system.
at
present,
the
ratio
is
approximately
three
to
two.
this
will
be
accomplished
in
accordance
with
the
schedule
set
out
below.
and
then
under
(b),
schedule
of
faculty
desegregation,
1968-69,
that's
the
current
school
year.
at
every
school
with
fewer
than
12
teachers,
the
board
will
have
at
least
one
full
time
teacher
whose
race
is
different
from
the
race
of
the
majority
of
the
faculty
and
staff
members
of
the
school.
at
every
school
with
12
or
more
teachers,
the
race
of
at
least
one
of
every
six
faculty
and
staff
members
will
be
different
from
the
race
of
the
majority
of
the
faculty
and
staff
members
at
the
school
and
then
the
court
will
reserve
for
the
time
being
other
specific
faculty
and
staff
desegregation
requirements
for
future
years.
so
that
though
there
is
a
statement
of
objective
in
terms
of
three
to
two,
the
only
order
of
the
court
was
that
in
schools
of
12
or
more
faculty
members,
the
ratio
should
be
five
to
one.
now,
that
it
seems
to
me
is
not
as
mechanical
or
rigid
as
it
might
seem
when
one
examines
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
i
call
attention
to
the
top
of
the
court's
opinion,
the
top
of
page
759
where
the
court
has
in
large
capital
letters,
“fixed
mathematical”
ratio.
the
court
of
appeals
because
of
that
fixed
mathematical
ratio
made
two
changes
in
the
decree
of
the
district
court.
instead
of
maintaining
the
five
to
one
ratio,
with
respect
to
schools
of
12
or
more,
it
required
inserting
substantially
and
more
approximately
five
to
one,
and
then
on
page
765
of
its
opinion,
it
struck
out
the
three
to
two
ratio
entirely.
on
page
765,
the
court
said,
“there
must
be
a
good
faith
and
effective
beginning
and
good
faith
and
effective
effort
to
achieve
faculty
and
staff
desegregation
for
the
entire
system,
although
a
ratio
of
substantially
or
approximately
five
to
one
is
a
good
beginning,
we
cannot
say
that
a
ratio
of
substantially
three
to
two
simply
because
it
mirrors
the
ratio
balance
of
the
entire
faculty
must
be
achieved
as
a
final
objective.”
and
so
the
ratio
provisions
of
the
district
court's
opinion
were
left
out
and
the
only
thing
that
was
left
in
to
guide
the
future
development
here
is
that
there
must
be
a
good
faith
and
effective
beginning
and
a
good
faith
and
effective
effort
to
achieve
faculty
and
staff
desegregation.
now,
that
obviously
is
wholly
vague
and
uncertain.
it
means
that
the
case
must
be
tried
a
new
every
time
it
comes
up
at
large
and
not
merely
on
matters
of
detail
in
connection
with
the
practical
problems
of
complying
with
the
decree.
indeed,
it
may
well
be
that
this
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
court's
order
was
that
it
be
five
to
one.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
court
of
appeals
put
in
substantially
or
approximately
five.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh!
yes
mr.
justice,
that
would
be
considerably
more
than
they
had
achieved
so
far
and
from
the
materials
referred
to
in
the
respondent's
brief
here,
it
would
appear
that
they
have
made
substantial
progress
towards
that.
five
to
one
of
course
is
a
long
way
from
three
to
two.
it
may
be
that
the
generality
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
no
kindness
to
the
school
board
of
montgomery
county
and
its
responsible
employees.
the
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
said
early
in
its
opinion
at
the
outset
we
note
that
the
testimony
of
the
school
officials
indicates
a
need
for
specific
directives
in
the
instant
case
and
the
court
set
out
some
of
that
testimony.
before
going
further
i
should
point
out
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
two
to
one
decision
with
judge
thornberry
dissenting.
the
plaintiffs
and
the
government
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
before
the
full
court
of
appeals,
that
petition
was
denied
by
a
vote
of
six
to
six
and
within
opinion
supporting
the
rehearing
by
chief
judge
brown.
it
should
also
be
noted
that
the
modification
of
the
decree
ordered
by
the
court
of
appeals
knocks
out
the
portions
of
the
district
court's
order
which
were
applicable
to
substitute
teachers,
student
teachers
and
night
schools.
it
should
be
noted
that
at
the
time
judge
johnson's
order
was
entered
in
february
and
march
1968,
there
had
been
virtually
no
desegregation
of
substitute
teachers
and
none
of
student
teachers
are
night
schools
and
there
were
no
plans
in
these
areas.
thus,
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
respondents
were
making
progress
on
these
matters.
they
had
not
even
started.
the
brief
for
the
respondents
relies
on
the
facts
also
relied
on
by
the
majority
in
the
panel
below
that
judge
johnson
several
times
complemented
the
respondents
on
their
efforts
and
their
progress
over
the
years
from
1964
to
1968.
but
this
case
can
hardly
be
decided
by
recalling
complements.
the
record
also
shows
that
judge
johnson
in
february
1968
expressed
his
concern
about
the
conduct
of
the
court.
he
suggested
that
a
geographic
zone
plan
might
be
have
to
be
imposed
if
it
continued
that
conduct.
in
his
february
opinion,
judge
johnson
spoke
of
aggravating
conduct
by
the
board
and
he
said
that
the
respondents
here
would
have
to
act
less
dilatorily.
the
respondents
also
rely
on
their
brief
on
the
appreciable
progress
which
they
have
made
over
the
past
year.
since
the
decree
of
the
district
court
was
entered
and
indeed
since
the
decision
of
the
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
can
be
grateful
for
what
they
have
accomplished
but
it
is
in
fact
far
short
of
the
objectives
of
the
district
court's
decree.
it
may
be
that
it
complies
with
the
requirements
of
the
decree
as
modified
by
the
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
serves
to
illustrate
the
short
comings
of
that
modification
since
the
results
achieved
are
so
far
short
of
disestablishing
the
segregation
in
the
respondent's
school
system.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
constitution
requires
a
mathematical
ratio
in
the
allocation
of
faculty
members.
we
do
not
contend
that
such
a
ratio
should
be
applied
in
all
cases
involving
all
school
systems.
we
have
here
a
school
system
which
was
undeniably
completely
segregated
by
law
for
many
years
and
in
which
no
steps
or
plans
were
made
for
change
up
to
1964
when
this
suit
was
filed.
we
have
here
a
case
where
token
changes
had
been
made
over
the
four
years
from
1964
to
1968.
we
have
here
a
case
which
has
been
presided
over
by
an
able
and
understanding
district
judge
wholly
familiar
with
the
local
situation
who
engaged
in
patient
proving
for
a
long
time
and
then
finally
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
ultimate
result,
this
establishment
of
segregation
in
a
system
which
had
long
been
legally
completely
segregated
would
be
achieved
only
by
reallocation
of
teachers,
so
that
no
school
would
any
longer
carry
that
mark
that
it
was
a
white
school
or
a
black
school.
the
district
judge
in
such
a
case
should
have
wide
latitude
in
formulating
and
structuring
his
decree
in
order
to
bring
about
a
result
which
is
undeniably
in
accordance
with
law.
this
is
not
a
case
where
a
judge
has
made
a
decree
which
condones
their
failure
to
comply
with
the
law.
it
is
a
case
where
a
district
judge
in
a
case
nearly
four
years
old
when
he
acted
set
down
a
standard
for
action
which
would
clearly
comply
with
the
law
as
enunciated
by
this
court.
in
such
a
situation,
the
decree
of
the
district
judge
should
not
have
been
modified
by
the
court
of
appeals.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
and
the
decree
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
response.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
school
desegregation
case.
the
question
arises
here
however
with
respect
to
faculty
desegregation
rather
than
directly
with
student
desegregation.
the
issue
is
a
rather
narrow
but
important
one.
it
arises
with
respect
to
the
schools
of
montgomery
county,
alabama
including
not
only
those
in
the
city
of
montgomery
but
also
those
in
the
surrounding
county
area.
for
the
1967-1968
school
year,
the
defendants
operated
52
schools
including
32
predominantly
white
and
20
predominantly
negro
schools.
there
were
approximately
22,500
white
students
and
17,000
negro
students
taught
by
approximately
815
white
teachers
and
550
negro
teachers.
this
suit
began
with
a
complaint
which
was
filed
on
may
11,
1964
almost
five
years
ago.
at
that
time
as
the
district
court
stated
in
its
opinion
and
this
is
at
page
524
of
the
printed
record,
the
montgomery
county
board
of
education
had
taken
no
steps
and
had
made
no
plans
whatsoever
to
comply
with
the
law
of
this
land
in
the
area
of
school
desegregation
even
though
ten
years
had
passed
when
this
matter
came
on
for
a
hearing
in
1964,
the
montgomery
county
board
of
education
was
allowed
by
this
court
to
proceed
with
desegregation
gradually
for
the
reason
that
it
was
realized
that
desegregation
of
the
public
schools
cut
across
the
social
fabric
of
this
community
and
that
there
would
be
both
administrative
and
other
practical
problems
for
the
board
to
cope
with.
and
the
court
went
on
to
show
the
way
in
which
it
had
helped
to
cooperate
with
the
board
and
moving
forward
in
this
and
concluded
however
we
have
reached
the
point
where
we
must
pass
tokenism
and
the
order
that
was
entered
in
this
case
on
february
24,
1968
is
designed
to
accomplish
this
purpose.
it
was
not
designed
to
and
was
not
intended
to
accomplish
and
if
complied
with
will
not
require
more
than
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
and
the
other
appellate
courts
have
held
must
be
accomplished
in
order
to
desegregate
a
public
school
system.
well,
now
what
had
been
done
since
the
suit
was
filed
in
1964,
in
the
year
1964-65,
as
a
result
of
an
order
of
the
court
entered
on
july
31,
1964,
the
board
permitted
transfers
under
the
alabama
school
placement
law
in
four
grades,
grade
1
and
grades
10,
11,
and
12,
being
the
senior
high
school.
this
order
did
not
affect
the
system
of
initial
assignments
on
the
basis
of
race.
the
board
accepted
eight
of
29
negroes
who
applied
to
transfer
to
traditionally
white
schools.
two
students
withdrew
their
applications
and
the
board
denied
the
remaining
19
applications,
so
that
during
the
first
year,
there
were
eight
negro
students
in
what
had
previously
been
white
schools.
in
1965-66,
grades
1,
2,
7,
and
9
through
12
were
to
be
desegregated,
49
negro
students
applied
to
attend
predominantly
white
schools.
the
defendants
rejected
applications
from
31
of
these
and
accepted
18
applications.
on
appeal
to
the
court,
the
court
overturned
six
of
the
rejections
but
accepted
the
remainder.
this
made
24
students
who
were
admitted
to
the
schools.
in
1966-67,
approximately
330
negro
students
chose
to
attend
white
school
--
traditionally
white
schools
in
montgomery
county,
no
white
students
chose
to
attend
traditionally
negro
schools.
this
was
the
first
year
that
the
school
board
operated
under
a
freedom
of
choice
plan
without
initial
assignment
on
the
basis
of
race
except
in
the
two
grades
which
were
not
yet
covered
by
the
desegregation
plan
which
were
grades
5
and
6.
in
the
year
1967-68
was
the
first
year
that
all
12
grades
were
to
be
formally
desegregated.
approximately,
550
negro
students
attended
traditionally
white
schools.
no
white
students
attended
negro
schools
and
in
the
year
1968-69,
the
current
year,
there
are
approximately
950
negro
students
in
30
traditionally
white
schools
and
approximately
16,500
or
94%
in
all
negro
schools.
there
are
no
white
students
in
negro
schools.
so
that
in
summary,
as
of
today,
no
white
student
has
ever
attended
a
traditionally
negro
school
in
montgomery
county.
the
number
of
negro
students
attending
traditionally
white
schools
has
slowly
increased.
until
the
present
time,
it
is
950
which
seem
like
a
substantial
number
but
it
is
less
than
6%
of
the
negro
students
in
the
montgomery
county
school
system.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
what?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
relevance
mr.
justice
is
to
show
the
slowness
of
the
progress
which
had
occurred
over
four
years
and
the
background
for
the
order
of
the
judge
which
is
under
review
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
--
i'm
turning
now
to
faculty
which
is
the
issue
here.
there
was
complete
segregation
of
faculty
in
the
montgomery
county
public
schools
prior
to
september
1967.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
mr.
justice.
i
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
cannot.
i
do
not
have
that
information.
mr.
greenberg
may
be
able
to
supply
something
about
that
but
i
do
not
know.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
complaint
in
this
case,
as
i
have
said,
was
filed
on
may
11,
1964.
in
it,
the
plaintiff
sought
faculty
desegregation.
the
court's
first
order
made
no
specific
reference
to
faculty
desegregation
but
it
did
require
the
defendants
to
submit
a
plan
designed
to
eliminate
segregation
of
students
based
upon
race
and
the
complete
elimination
of
the
biracial
school
system
within
a
reasonable
time.
the
defendant's
first
segregation
plan
was
submitted
in
january
1965
and
it
was
sound
as
to
faculty
desegregation.
the
plaintiff's
objected
but
the
court
declined
to
act
beyond
ordering
the
defendants
for
the
second
time
to
submit
a
plan
for
the
complete
elimination
of
the
biracial
school
system
within
a
reasonable
time.
the
defendant's
second
desegregation
plan
was
submitted
in
january
1966
and
it
too
was
sound
as
to
faculty
desegregation.
both
the
plaintiffs
and
the
government
objected.
and
on
march
22nd,
the
district
court,
ordered
the
board
to
adopt
a
desegregation
plan
providing
in
part
and
this
appears
on
page
337
of
the
printed
record
that
race
or
color
will
henceforth
not
be
a
factor
in
the
hiring,
assignment,
reassignment,
promotion,
demotion
or
dismissal
of
teachers
and
other
professional
staff
with
the
exception
that
assignments
shall
be
made
in
order
to
eliminate
the
effects
of
past
discrimination.
teachers,
principals
and
staff
members
will
be
assigned
to
schools
so
that
the
faculty
and
staff
is
not
composed
of
members
of
one
race
and
that
is
a
fine
statement
but
a
completely
general
in
its
terms
and
judge
johnson
at
that
time
stated
from
the
bench
that
i
will
not
expect
too
much
of
it,
meaning
faculty
desegregation
in
september
1966
because
of
the
timing
but
i
will
expect
a
considerable
amount
of
it,
effective
in
september
1967.
however
in
august
of
1966,
following
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
case
involving
the
mobile
schools,
judge
johnson
sua
sponte
declared
that
the
montgomery
board
would
have
the
same
period
available
as
the
court
of
appeals
had
established
for
mobile
and
that
they
would
be
allowed
until
the
school
year
1967-68
to
commence
desegregation
of
the
faculty
and
professional
staff
in
the
montgomery
county
school
system.
at
that
time,
the
defendants
had
tentatively
assigned
four
teachers
of
each
race
to
teach
in
high
schools
attended
predominantly
by
students
of
the
opposite
race
for
the
1966-67
year.
but
after
judge
johnson's
modification
in
august
1966,
these
assignments
were
not
implemented.
on
june
1,
1967,
the
district
court
ordered
the
defendants
to
adopt
a
desegregation
plan
with
faculty
provisions
substantially
similar
to
that
which
it
had
ordered
in
march
1966
but
with
certain
additions.
the
court
indicated
for
the
first
time
that
its
desegregation
order
was
to
extend
to
student
teachers.
also
the
court
directed
and

wherever
possible,
teachers
will
be
assigned
so
that
more
than
one
teacher
of
the
minority
race,
white
or
negro
will
be
on
a
desegregated
faculty.
the
school
board
will
take
positive
and
affirmative
steps
to
accomplish
the
desegregation
of
its
school
faculties
including
substantial
desegregation
of
faculties
in
as
many
of
the
schools
as
possible
for
the
1967-68
school
year
notwithstanding
the
teacher
contracts
for
the
1967-68
or
1968-69
school
year
have
already
been
signed
and
approved.
the
objective
of
the
school
system
is
that
the
pattern
of
teacher
assignment
to
any
particular
school
shall
not
be
identifiable
as
tailored
for
a
heavy
concentration
of
either
negro
or
white
pupils
in
the
school
and
here
again
is
an
excellent
general
statement
with
no
appreciable
specific
standard.
as
a
result
of
which,
the
defendants
assigned
five
teachers
of
each
race
to
schools
predominantly
of
the
opposite
race.
the
10
teachers
taught
only
at
four
high
schools
in
the
city
of
montgomery,
none
in
any
elementary
schools,
none
in
any
of
the
schools
outside
of
the
city
except
that
in
the
elementary
schools,
the
defendants
did
assigned
three
white
speech
therapists
to
teach
in
all
elementary
schools.
on
august
17,
1967,
the
government
objected
to
the
defendant's
failure
to
bring
about
more
faculty
desegregation
and
move
for
further
relief
and
the
plaintiffs
in
the
action
joined
in
the
motion.
there
was
a
hearing
in
september
1967
and
the
superintendent
of
the
montgomery
school
board,
mr.
mckee
explained
the
defendant's
failure
to
assign
desegregating
faculty
members
to
48
of
their
52
schools.
he
said,
we
felt,
there
would
be
less
objection
in
the
senior
high
schools
because
one
teacher
would
not
have
the
pupils
as
much
of
today
as
they
would
in
the
lower
grades.
he
acknowledged
reassigning
over
40
negro
teachers
from
schools
close
pursuant
to
court
order
to
other
negro
schools
for
the
1967-68
school
year.
he
also
acknowledged
assigning
over
90
new
teachers
for
the
1967-68
school
year
to
schools
where
their
race
predominated.
the
court
declined
to
enter
in
a
further
order
in
the
fall
of
1967.
however,
in
january
1968,
the
district
court
set
the
august
1967
motion
of
the
united
states
down
for
a
second
hearing
in
february
1968,
a
little
over
year
ago.
both
the
government
and
the
plaintiffs
filed
a
supplemental
motion
for
further
relief
shortly
before
the
hearing.
in
the
meantime,
the
defendants
had
assigned
six
or
seven
additional
white
teachers
to
three
or
four
more
traditionally
negro
schools,
so
that
seven
or
eight
of
the
52
schools
had
desegregated
facilities.
the
chief
evidence
concerning
desegregation
is
summarized
in
the
district
court's
opinion
of
february
24,
1968.this
is
on
page
493
and
494
of
the
printed
record.
since
the
order
of
this
court
on
june
1,
1967,
judge
johnson
said,
“defendants
have
assigned
or
transferred
approximately
75
new
teachers
to
faculties
where
their
race
was
in
the
majority.
since
the
opening
of
school
in
september
1967,
defendants
have
hired
approximately
32
new
teachers,
26
white
and
6
negro.
of
the
26
new
white
teachers,
only
six
or
seven
have
been
placed
in
predominantly
negro
schools.
all
six
negroes
were
assigned
to
predominantly
negro
schools.”
and
the
judge
went
on
to
say,
“the
defendants
have
adopted
no
adequate
program
for
the
assignment
of
student
teachers
on
a
desegregated
basis.
none
of
the
approximately
150
student
teachers
whose
in
the
montgomery
county
school
system
in
the
fall
of
1967
were
assigned
to
schools
predominantly
of
the
opposite
race.
four
negro
schools
--
four
negro
student
teachers
have
very
recently
been
assigned
to
predominantly
white
schools.
there
has
been
no
faculty
desegregation
in
the
night
schools
operated
by
the
montgomery
county
school
system.”
now,
judge
johnson
could
have
added
that
the
defendants
had
continue
their
policy
of
assigning
negro
teachers
only
to
negro
schools
and
the
two
traditionally
white
senior
high
schools
in
the
city
of
montgomery.
they
had
assigned
no
negro
teachers
to
traditionally
white
elementary
or
junior
high
schools
or
to
a
predominantly
white
senior
high
school
outside
of
montgomery.
no
teacher
was
assigned
to
teach
an
academic
subject
in
a
traditionally
white
school.
superintendent
mckee
testified
that
the
defendants
assigned
white
teachers
to
negro
schools
only
if
the
teachers
expressed
the
willingness
to
teach
there
even
though
the
superintendent
knew
he
testified
that
the
law
did
not
permit
him
to
rely
on
voluntariness.
the
defendants
continued
to
hire
new
white
teachers
whose
application
showed
that
they
would
not
accept
integrated
faculty.
the
defendants
assigned
negro
teachers
to
negro
schools
even
though
they
were
willing
to
teach
at
traditionally
white
schools
because
of
the
defendant's
concern
for
the
reaction
of
white
community
members.
and
so
in
summary,
at
the
time
the
order
with
which
we
are
concerned
was
entered,
prior
to
1967,
there
was
no
faculty
desegregation.
during
1967-68,
32
teachers,
26
white
and
6
negro
out
of
over
1350
were
assigned
to
schools
where
their
race
was
in
the
minority.
four
of
over
300
student
teachers
were
assigned
to
desegregating
positions.
no
negro
substituted
for
a
teacher
in
a
traditionally
white
school.
night
school
facilities
were
segregated;
during
the
year
1968-69,
since
the
order
of
the
court
below,
216
teachers
have
been
assigned
to
desegregating
positions.
now,
in
this
situation,
what
was
the
order
of
judge
johnson?
it
appears
on
pages
503
to
510
of
the
record
but
it
was
then
amended
on
pages
520
to
523
and
i
think
the
most
convenient
place
to
examine
it
is
as
it
is
set
out
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
where
it
is
set
out
with
the
amendments
incorporated
and
that
appears
on
page
754
of
the
record.
it
is
there
exactly
the
same
as
in
the
references
i
previously
gave
except
the
amendments
have
been
read
in.
it
starts
out
on
page
754,
statement
of
objective.
in
achieving
the
objective
of
the
school
system
that
the
pattern
of
teacher
assignments
to
any
particular
school
shall
not
be
identifiable
as
tailored
for
a
heavy
concentration
of
either
negro
or
white
pupils
in
the
school.
the
school
board
will
be
guided
by
the
ratio
of
negro
to
white
faculty
members
in
the
school
system
as
a
whole.
and
that
is
about
60-40,
about
three
to
two,
three
white
to
two
negro.
the
school
board
will
accomplish
faculty
desegregation
by
hiring
and
assigning
faculty
members
so
that
in
each
school,
the
ratio
of
white
to
negro
faculty
members
is
substantially
the
same
as
it
is
throughout
the
system.
at
present,
the
ratio
is
approximately
three
to
two.
this
will
be
accomplished
in
accordance
with
the
schedule
set
out
below.
and
then
under
(b),
schedule
of
faculty
desegregation,
1968-69,
that's
the
current
school
year.
at
every
school
with
fewer
than
12
teachers,
the
board
will
have
at
least
one
full
time
teacher
whose
race
is
different
from
the
race
of
the
majority
of
the
faculty
and
staff
members
of
the
school.
at
every
school
with
12
or
more
teachers,
the
race
of
at
least
one
of
every
six
faculty
and
staff
members
will
be
different
from
the
race
of
the
majority
of
the
faculty
and
staff
members
at
the
school
and
then
the
court
will
reserve
for
the
time
being
other
specific
faculty
and
staff
desegregation
requirements
for
future
years.
so
that
though
there
is
a
statement
of
objective
in
terms
of
three
to
two,
the
only
order
of
the
court
was
that
in
schools
of
12
or
more
faculty
members,
the
ratio
should
be
five
to
one.
now,
that
it
seems
to
me
is
not
as
mechanical
or
rigid
as
it
might
seem
when
one
examines
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
i
call
attention
to
the
top
of
the
court's
opinion,
the
top
of
page
759
where
the
court
has
in
large
capital
letters,
“fixed
mathematical”
ratio.
the
court
of
appeals
because
of
that
fixed
mathematical
ratio
made
two
changes
in
the
decree
of
the
district
court.
instead
of
maintaining
the
five
to
one
ratio,
with
respect
to
schools
of
12
or
more,
it
required
inserting
substantially
and
more
approximately
five
to
one,
and
then
on
page
765
of
its
opinion,
it
struck
out
the
three
to
two
ratio
entirely.
on
page
765,
the
court
said,
“there
must
be
a
good
faith
and
effective
beginning
and
good
faith
and
effective
effort
to
achieve
faculty
and
staff
desegregation
for
the
entire
system,
although
a
ratio
of
substantially
or
approximately
five
to
one
is
a
good
beginning,
we
cannot
say
that
a
ratio
of
substantially
three
to
two
simply
because
it
mirrors
the
ratio
balance
of
the
entire
faculty
must
be
achieved
as
a
final
objective.”
and
so
the
ratio
provisions
of
the
district
court's
opinion
were
left
out
and
the
only
thing
that
was
left
in
to
guide
the
future
development
here
is
that
there
must
be
a
good
faith
and
effective
beginning
and
a
good
faith
and
effective
effort
to
achieve
faculty
and
staff
desegregation.
now,
that
obviously
is
wholly
vague
and
uncertain.
it
means
that
the
case
must
be
tried
a
new
every
time
it
comes
up
at
large
and
not
merely
on
matters
of
detail
in
connection
with
the
practical
problems
of
complying
with
the
decree.
indeed,
it
may
well
be
that
this
is
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
court's
order
was
that
it
be
five
to
one.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
court
of
appeals
put
in
substantially
or
approximately
five.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
oh!
yes
mr.
justice,
that
would
be
considerably
more
than
they
had
achieved
so
far
and
from
the
materials
referred
to
in
the
respondent's
brief
here,
it
would
appear
that
they
have
made
substantial
progress
towards
that.
five
to
one
of
course
is
a
long
way
from
three
to
two.
it
may
be
that
the
generality
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
no
kindness
to
the
school
board
of
montgomery
county
and
its
responsible
employees.
the
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
said
early
in
its
opinion
at
the
outset
we
note
that
the
testimony
of
the
school
officials
indicates
a
need
for
specific
directives
in
the
instant
case
and
the
court
set
out
some
of
that
testimony.
before
going
further
i
should
point
out
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
a
two
to
one
decision
with
judge
thornberry
dissenting.
the
plaintiffs
and
the
government
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
before
the
full
court
of
appeals,
that
petition
was
denied
by
a
vote
of
six
to
six
and
within
opinion
supporting
the
rehearing
by
chief
judge
brown.
it
should
also
be
noted
that
the
modification
of
the
decree
ordered
by
the
court
of
appeals
knocks
out
the
portions
of
the
district
court's
order
which
were
applicable
to
substitute
teachers,
student
teachers
and
night
schools.
it
should
be
noted
that
at
the
time
judge
johnson's
order
was
entered
in
february
and
march
1968,
there
had
been
virtually
no
desegregation
of
substitute
teachers
and
none
of
student
teachers
are
night
schools
and
there
were
no
plans
in
these
areas.
thus,
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
respondents
were
making
progress
on
these
matters.
they
had
not
even
started.
the
brief
for
the
respondents
relies
on
the
facts
also
relied
on
by
the
majority
in
the
panel
below
that
judge
johnson
several
times
complemented
the
respondents
on
their
efforts
and
their
progress
over
the
years
from
1964
to
1968.
but
this
case
can
hardly
be
decided
by
recalling
complements.
the
record
also
shows
that
judge
johnson
in
february
1968
expressed
his
concern
about
the
conduct
of
the
court.
he
suggested
that
a
geographic
zone
plan
might
be
have
to
be
imposed
if
it
continued
that
conduct.
in
his
february
opinion,
judge
johnson
spoke
of
aggravating
conduct
by
the
board
and
he
said
that
the
respondents
here
would
have
to
act
less
dilatorily.
the
respondents
also
rely
on
their
brief
on
the
appreciable
progress
which
they
have
made
over
the
past
year.
since
the
decree
of
the
district
court
was
entered
and
indeed
since
the
decision
of
the
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
can
be
grateful
for
what
they
have
accomplished
but
it
is
in
fact
far
short
of
the
objectives
of
the
district
court's
decree.
it
may
be
that
it
complies
with
the
requirements
of
the
decree
as
modified
by
the
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
serves
to
illustrate
the
short
comings
of
that
modification
since
the
results
achieved
are
so
far
short
of
disestablishing
the
segregation
in
the
respondent's
school
system.
we
do
not
contend
that
the
constitution
requires
a
mathematical
ratio
in
the
allocation
of
faculty
members.
we
do
not
contend
that
such
a
ratio
should
be
applied
in
all
cases
involving
all
school
systems.
we
have
here
a
school
system
which
was
undeniably
completely
segregated
by
law
for
many
years
and
in
which
no
steps
or
plans
were
made
for
change
up
to
1964
when
this
suit
was
filed.
we
have
here
a
case
where
token
changes
had
been
made
over
the
four
years
from
1964
to
1968.
we
have
here
a
case
which
has
been
presided
over
by
an
able
and
understanding
district
judge
wholly
familiar
with
the
local
situation
who
engaged
in
patient
proving
for
a
long
time
and
then
finally
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
ultimate
result,
this
establishment
of
segregation
in
a
system
which
had
long
been
legally
completely
segregated
would
be
achieved
only
by
reallocation
of
teachers,
so
that
no
school
would
any
longer
carry
that
mark
that
it
was
a
white
school
or
a
black
school.
the
district
judge
in
such
a
case
should
have
wide
latitude
in
formulating
and
structuring
his
decree
in
order
to
bring
about
a
result
which
is
undeniably
in
accordance
with
law.
this
is
not
a
case
where
a
judge
has
made
a
decree
which
condones
their
failure
to
comply
with
the
law.
it
is
a
case
where
a
district
judge
in
a
case
nearly
four
years
old
when
he
acted
set
down
a
standard
for
action
which
would
clearly
comply
with
the
law
as
enunciated
by
this
court.
in
such
a
situation,
the
decree
of
the
district
judge
should
not
have
been
modified
by
the
court
of
appeals.
we
submit
that
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
and
the
decree
of
the
district
court
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no
response.
