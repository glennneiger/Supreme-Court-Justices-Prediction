mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
earl

mr.
greenberg.
chief
justice
earl
warren
as
to
what
date
were
those
record,
do
you
recall,
mr.
greenberg?
chief
justice
earl
warren
1966.
yes.
while
this
case
was
going
on.
and
so
that
the
specificity
of
the
order
should
be
seen
not
only
against
the
background
of
whatever
it
was
that
motivated
the
local
school
board
but
in
a
certain
sense
may
be
seen
as
a
protective
device
for
a
local
school
board
which
desires
to
comply
with
an
order.
now,
as
the
solicitor
general
stated,
this
case
involves
two
fundamental
issues.
one
is
the
question
of
the
standards
by
which
district
courts
should
review
desegregation
plans
of
school
systems
which
have
previously
been
segregated
pursuant
to
law,
and
as
another
aspect
of
that,
more
importantly,
it
involves
the
vitality
of
this
court's
decision
last
year
in
green
against
county
school
board
where
this
court
held
that
desegregation
plans
must
work.
two
things
should
be
stated
clearly
at
the
outset
though
they
appear
in
the
record
and
on
the
briefs
and
that
is
this
case
does
not
involve
a
hiring
quota.
it
is
not
a
case
in
which
any
fixed
proportion
of
negro
or
white
teachers
must
be
employed
by
the
system.
or
the
standard
of
employment
may
be
any
objective
standard
as
the
standard
employment
has
set
forth
in
the
decree
of
the
united
states
against
jefferson
county
which
was
entered
in
this
case
previously
and
which
appears
in
the
record
in
the
briefs
and
that
is
that
race
--
only
that
race
may
not
be
a
standard
in
employment.
the
jefferson
standard
included
also
that
race
may
be
taken
into
account
for
the
purpose
of
counter-acting
or
correcting
the
effect
of
the
past
segregated
assignment
of
teachers
in
the
dual
system
and
to
that
extent,
i
think
anticipated
the
ruling
in
the
instant
case.
second
thing
i
think
of
considerable
importance
that
should
be
noted
is
that
the
area
of
disagreement
between
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
is
not
one
of
principle
and
not
one
of
constitutionality
but
one
of
standards
and
workability.
judges
guinn
and
elliott
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
page
766
assert
that
race
may
be
taken
into
account
for
purposes
of
counter
acting
or
correcting
the
effects
of
racial
segregation
in
any
dual
school
system
as
has
been
held
previously
in
this
court
and
elsewhere.
their
objections
of
the
ruling
of
the
trial
court
is
one
of
that
it
is
not
workable.
it
is
not
a
sufficiently
flexible
system.
on
763,
they
write,
“it
is
our
conclusion
of
the
standards
fixed
by
courts
with
respect
to
faculty
desegregation
cannot
be
totally
inflexible
and
as
a
consequence,
what
they
did
was
they
took
out
the
numerical
ratios
of
substituting
and
then
their
court
order
merely
doesn't
tell
the
trial
court
of
the
school
board
what
to
do
which
it
tells
them
not
what
to
do
which
it
tells
them
what
not
to
do
in
766.
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
order
will
be
modified
accordingly
and
the
numerical
ratios
set
forth
in
the
district
court
order
and
decree
will
be
eliminated.
now,
this
court
in
green
said
that
a
plan
must
work.
the
district
judge
writing
his
opinion
shortly
before
the
decision
in
the
green
case
anticipated
in
effect
what
this
court
said
in
green
and
he
set
down
a
workable
standard,
a
standard
by
which
the
district
court
could
work
after
he
has
to
be
able
to
measure
whether
or
not
there
is
compliance
and
by
which
the
school
board
can
work.
as
a
substitute
for
that,
the
court
of
appeals
gives
us
nothing
and
we
would
like
to
submit
several
reasons
why
we
believe
the
district
court
was
clearly
correct.
first
of
all,
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out,
the
district
judge
has
lived
with
this
case
for
four
years.
he
knows
the
record,
he
knows
the
school
system.
he
knows
the
defendants.
he
knows
their
internal
problems
and
their
problems
they
have
with
regard
to
the
rest
of
the
state.
he
found
explicitly
in
his
opinion
that
there
were
no
administrative
difficulties
either
to
his
immediate
goals
or
to
achieving
his
ultimate
objective.
secondly,
the
respondents
in
an
appendix
to
their
brief
set
forth
what
they
have
done
with
respect
to
the
interim
goals,
that
is
the
one
to
five.
and
if
you
look
at
those
statistics,
they
demonstrate
that
when
the
school
board
is
given
a
numerical
goal,
it
knows
how
to
abide
by
it,
and
then
a
numerical
goal
can
work
and
consequently,
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
if
having
been
given
one
to
five,
they
can't
do
more
but
the
numerical
ratio
as
having
been
stricken
from
the
district
court
opinion
by
the
court
of
appeals.
no
one
knows
what
to
do
now.
should
they
go
to
two
to
five,
two-and-a-half
to
five,
three
to
five,
it's
not
known.
thirdly,
the
superintendent
in
charge
of
faculties
testified
that
he
needed
precise
instructions.
generalities
were
not
good
enough
for
him.
on
page
657,
we
have
him
testifying,
657
and
658,
“i
don't
know
what
the
objectives
of
the
court
order
are.
this
is
previous
to
the
numerical
ratios
having
been
set
down.
that
has
never
been
laid
down
in
any
percentage
fashion
that
i
know
of.
it
says
that
you
will
have
reasonable
desegregation
of
faculty
and
that
you
will
strive
to
would
have
in
each
faculty
not
recognizable
as
being
staff
for
particular
race.
now,
with
the
order
in
that
form,
he
didn't
know
what
to
do.
judge
johnson
has
told
him
what
to
do.
the
court
of
appeals
has
struck
that
out
and
now
he
is
back
where
he
started
again.
the
situation
is
as
he
went
on
saying,
that
would
depend
upon
with
the
definition
of
it
is.
and
we
have
discussed
it
many
times.
i
do
not
have
a
definition
of
what
that
would
mean.
and
this
testimony
of
the
school
superintendent
precisely
describes
what
the
state
of
mind
of
the
school
board
has
to
be
in
the
present
status.
the
court
of
appeals
has
put
him
back
in
a
situation
in
which
according
to
his
own
testimony,
he
does
not
know
what
to
do.
now,
the
numerical
ratio
of
60-40
or
three
to
two
is
not
taken
out
of
the
blue
on
668
of
the
record,
we
have
judge
johnson
speaking
to
the
superintendent
and
suggesting
that
perhaps
a
numerical
ratio
like
that
would
be
appropriate.
and
he
says,
“your
student
population,”
he
was
referring
to
the
student
population
but
he
really
must
have
meant
in
fact
that
the
student
ratio
was
somewhat
different.
“your
student
population
is
60-40.”
“yes
sir.”
“ultimately,
that
would
be
optimum
if
you're
going
to
eliminate
the
racial
characteristics
of
your
school
through
faculty,
knotted
to
indicate
affirmative
reply.”
and
so
when
this
was
suggested
to
the
school
superintendent
and
the
assistant
superintendent
towards
the
faculty
as
an
acceptable
ratio,
he
acquiesced
in
it
to
preferably
an
agreeable
way
of
going
about
it.
finally,
the
notion
of
numerical
ratios
is
one
which
is
entirely
suitable
for
use
by
this
board
and
indeed
based
to
those
initially
that
numbers
was
what
they
were
going.
on
656
of
the
record,
the
assistant
superintendent
says,
“well,
the
way
i'll
go
about
it
is
first
i'll
put
one
in
each
school
and
then
i'll
put
two
in
each
school
and
then
i'll
put
three
in
each
school
and
so
on
and
so
on.
so
numbers
is
not
an
unconginular
impossible
way
of
working
according
to
their
own
testimony
and
the
judge
pointed
out
indeed
in
his
opinion
that
the
formula
which
he
proposed
was
a
little
different
from
what
they
were
doing
as
founded
in
the
record
on
page
526.
now,
the
numerical
ratio
as
i
pointed
out
protects
the
board
in
two
senses.
it
protects
them
because
now
they
know
what
to
do.
it
is
less
likely
they
will
be
contempt.
it
is
less
likely
they
will
be
in
violation.
it
protects
them
also
against
depredations
by
state
authorities.
and
finally,
other
courts
have
found
this
type
of
approach
useful.
in
the
dowell
case
in
oklahoma
city,
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed
the
use
of
precisely
such
ratio
and
it
might
be
pointed
out
that
it
initially
was
suggested
by
a
panel
of
educators
that
it
is
being
used
in
other
courts
throughout
the
country
as
cited
in
our
brief.
most
importantly
however,
the
court
of
appeals
are
no
record
whatsoever
substituted
a
vapid
good
faith
standard
requirement
for
one
which
is
resting
on
a
solid
record.
this
is
based
upon
that.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
the
history
of
desegregation
in
the
courts
has
been
that
specificity
and
immediacy
bring
results
and
the
generalities
do
not.
and
this
is
the
sense
of
the
green
decision
of
this
court
of
last
year.
since
green
has
been
handed
down,
it
has
indeed
been
working.
more
important
its
effect
is
pervasive
beyond
the
judicial
system
because
its
standards
are
being
incorporated
as
the
standards
of
this
court
on
other
school
desegregation
issues
are
incorporated
into
the
guidelines
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare,
so
it
has
an
effect
beyond
the
ordinary
effect
of
stare
decisis.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
a
throw
back.
there's
no
justification
for
it
and
that
it
should
be
reversed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
phelps.
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
that
been
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
effect
of
that
policy
of
the
state
government
that
mr.
greenberg
just
read
a
moment
ago,
if
the
policy
of
the
state
government
being
against
doing
this
very
thing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
there
been
a
change?
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
there
been
a
change
in
the
state
policy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
it
been
announced?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'd
like
to
hear
you
tell
us
how
it's
been
announced.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
whereas
the
governor
of
the
state
announced
in
many
way
that
it
has
changed
its
policy
in
this
regard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
a
statement
that
it's
going
to
consider
education
in
alabama
as
announcement
and
abandon
all
its
segregation
policies.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
you
said
15
years
ago
almost
to
the
day
that
the
climate
wasn't
to
be
considered.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
say,
my
recollection
is
that
15
years
ago
almost
to
the
day
that
brown
versus
board
of
education,
you
said
that
climate
was
not
one
of
the
things
that
should
be
considered
in
desegregation
was
to
made.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
is
that
you
shuffle
your
elementary
teachers
as
between
white
and
black
schools?
why
can't
you
shuffle
your
junior
high
teachers
as
between
the
schools
in
the
same
with
the
high
school
teachers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
teacher
jones,
a
white
person,
is
teaching
first
year
history
in
the
high
school,
a
white
high
school,
and
teacher
smith,
a
black
person
is
teaching
the
same
subject
in
the
first
year
class
in
a
black
school,
why
couldn't
--
why
could
you
just
change
those
two
teachers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
as
i
--
i
thought
that
judge
johnson
held
that
you
need
not
do
that
school
by
school.
you
are
to
do
it
by
the
overall
population,
isn't
that
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
has
to
be
done
by
every
school?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
be
satisfied
with
his
decree
if
it
provided
for
doing
it
on
the
basis
of
your
overall
school
population
as
distinguished
from
each
individual
school?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
just
15
years
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
take
the
position
that
you
are
not
supposed
to
do
anything
until
you
have
a
court
order
compelling
you
to
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
why
do
you
start
with
1964?
why
don't
you
go
back
to
1954?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
should
there
be
any
difference
between
a
high
school
history
teacher
in
a
black
school
and
a
white
school
so
far
as
qualifications
are
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
argue
this
way
before
in
the
lower
courts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
or
let
me
read
from
the
court
of
appeals.
so
this
is
from
the
court
of
appeals,
yes.
on
page
757
of
the
record,
it
says,
however,
appellants
object
to
the
district
court's
order
requiring
assignment
of
teachers
on
the
ground
that
such
is
not
in
keeping
with
sound
and
quality
school
administration.
we
quote
from
appellant's
brief
and
then
it
quotes,
in
beckett
versus
school
board,
the
city
of
norfolk
virginia,
267
f.
supp.
118,
page
139.
the
court
stated
in
considering
faculty
desegregation,
“however,
in
line
with
the
most
recent
wheeler
case,
wheeler
versus
durham
city
board
of
education,
the
school
board
has
not
adopted
the
tactic
of
compelling
a
teacher
to
transfer.
moreover,
such
a
practice
would
not
be
in
accord
with
sound
educational
principle.”
did
you
argue
that
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
is
that
consistent
with
what
you're
arguing
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
i
read
some
place
in
the
record
that
you
no
longer
have
any
problem
of
replacing
teachers
that
used
to
be,
that
you'd
have
to
have
i
don't
know
how
many,
70
or
something
like
that
every
year
but
that
now,
you
don't
have
to
do
that
because
you
have
enough
teachers
that
stay
in
the
schools?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
phelps,
in
this
question
of
assignment,
do
you
reason
from
the
premise
that
any
teacher
who
is
qualified
to
teach
black
students
in
this
county
is
equally
qualified
to
teach
white
students?
chief
justice
earl
warren
teaching
the
same
thing.
you
start
--
your
reasoning
is
from
that
premise.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.

any
response?
chief

earl

very
well.
we'll

do
you
recall,
mr.
greenberg?
chief
justice
earl
warren
1966.
yes.
while
this
case
was
going
on.
and
so
that
the
specificity
of
the
order
should
be
seen
not
only
against
the
background
of
whatever
it
was
that
motivated
the
local
school
board
but
in
a
certain
sense
may
be
seen
as
a
protective
device
for
a
local
school
board
which
desires
to
comply
with
an
order.
now,
as
the
solicitor
general
stated,
this
case
involves
two
fundamental
issues.
one
is
the
question
of
the
standards
by
which
district
courts
should
review
desegregation
plans
of
school
systems
which
have
previously
been
segregated
pursuant
to
law,
and
as
another
aspect
of
that,
more
importantly,
it
involves
the
vitality
of
this
court's
decision
last
year
in
green
against
county
school
board
where
this
court
held
that
desegregation
plans
must
work.
two
things
should
be
stated
clearly
at
the
outset
though
they
appear
in
the
record
and
on
the
briefs
and
that
is
this
case
does
not
involve
a
hiring
quota.
it
is
not
a
case
in
which
any
fixed
proportion
of
negro
or
white
teachers
must
be
employed
by
the
system.
or
the
standard
of
employment
may
be
any
objective
standard
as
the
standard
employment
has
set
forth
in
the
decree
of
the
united
states
against
jefferson
county
which
was
entered
in
this
case
previously
and
which
appears
in
the
record
in
the
briefs
and
that
is
that
race
--
only
that
race
may
not
be
a
standard
in
employment.
the
jefferson
standard
included
also
that
race
may
be
taken
into
account
for
the
purpose
of
counter-acting
or
correcting
the
effect
of
the
past
segregated
assignment
of
teachers
in
the
dual
system
and
to
that
extent,
i
think
anticipated
the
ruling
in
the
instant
case.
second
thing
i
think
of
considerable
importance
that
should
be
noted
is
that
the
area
of
disagreement
between
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
is
not
one
of
principle
and
not
one
of
constitutionality
but
one
of
standards
and
workability.
judges
guinn
and
elliott
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
page
766
assert
that
race
may
be
taken
into
account
for
purposes
of
counter
acting
or
correcting
the
effects
of
racial
segregation
in
any
dual
school
system
as
has
been
held
previously
in
this
court
and
elsewhere.
their
objections
of
the
ruling
of
the
trial
court
is
one
of
that
it
is
not
workable.
it
is
not
a
sufficiently
flexible
system.
on
763,
they
write,
“it
is
our
conclusion
of
the
standards
fixed
by
courts
with
respect
to
faculty
desegregation
cannot
be
totally
inflexible
and
as
a
consequence,
what
they
did
was
they
took
out
the
numerical
ratios
of
substituting
and
then
their
court
order
merely
doesn't
tell
the
trial
court
of
the
school
board
what
to
do
which
it
tells
them
not
what
to
do
which
it
tells
them
what
not
to
do
in
766.
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
order
will
be
modified
accordingly
and
the
numerical
ratios
set
forth
in
the
district
court
order
and
decree
will
be
eliminated.
now,
this
court
in
green
said
that
a
plan
must
work.
the
district
judge
writing
his
opinion
shortly
before
the
decision
in
the
green
case
anticipated
in
effect
what
this
court
said
in
green
and
he
set
down
a
workable
standard,
a
standard
by
which
the
district
court
could
work
after
he
has
to
be
able
to
measure
whether
or
not
there
is
compliance
and
by
which
the
school
board
can
work.
as
a
substitute
for
that,
the
court
of
appeals
gives
us
nothing
and
we
would
like
to
submit
several
reasons
why
we
believe
the
district
court
was
clearly
correct.
first
of
all,
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out,
the
district
judge
has
lived
with
this
case
for
four
years.
he
knows
the
record,
he
knows
the
school
system.
he
knows
the
defendants.
he
knows
their
internal
problems
and
their
problems
they
have
with
regard
to
the
rest
of
the
state.
he
found
explicitly
in
his
opinion
that
there
were
no
administrative
difficulties
either
to
his
immediate
goals
or
to
achieving
his
ultimate
objective.
secondly,
the
respondents
in
an
appendix
to
their
brief
set
forth
what
they
have
done
with
respect
to
the
interim
goals,
that
is
the
one
to
five.
and
if
you
look
at
those
statistics,
they
demonstrate
that
when
the
school
board
is
given
a
numerical
goal,
it
knows
how
to
abide
by
it,
and
then
a
numerical
goal
can
work
and
consequently,
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
if
having
been
given
one
to
five,
they
can't
do
more
but
the
numerical
ratio
as
having
been
stricken
from
the
district
court
opinion
by
the
court
of
appeals.
no
one
knows
what
to
do
now.
should
they
go
to
two
to
five,
two-and-a-half
to
five,
three
to
five,
it's
not
known.
thirdly,
the
superintendent
in
charge
of
faculties
testified
that
he
needed
precise
instructions.
generalities
were
not
good
enough
for
him.
on
page
657,
we
have
him
testifying,
657
and
658,
“i
don't
know
what
the
objectives
of
the
court
order
are.
this
is
previous
to
the
numerical
ratios
having
been
set
down.
that
has
never
been
laid
down
in
any
percentage
fashion
that
i
know
of.
it
says
that
you
will
have
reasonable
desegregation
of
faculty
and
that
you
will
strive
to
would
have
in
each
faculty
not
recognizable
as
being
staff
for
particular
race.
now,
with
the
order
in
that
form,
he
didn't
know
what
to
do.
judge
johnson
has
told
him
what
to
do.
the
court
of
appeals
has
struck
that
out
and
now
he
is
back
where
he
started
again.
the
situation
is
as
he
went
on
saying,
that
would
depend
upon
with
the
definition
of
it
is.
and
we
have
discussed
it
many
times.
i
do
not
have
a
definition
of
what
that
would
mean.
and
this
testimony
of
the
school
superintendent
precisely
describes
what
the
state
of
mind
of
the
school
board
has
to
be
in
the
present
status.
the
court
of
appeals
has
put
him
back
in
a
situation
in
which
according
to
his
own
testimony,
he
does
not
know
what
to
do.
now,
the
numerical
ratio
of
60-40
or
three
to
two
is
not
taken
out
of
the
blue
on
668
of
the
record,
we
have
judge
johnson
speaking
to
the
superintendent
and
suggesting
that
perhaps
a
numerical
ratio
like
that
would
be
appropriate.
and
he
says,
“your
student
population,”
he
was
referring
to
the
student
population
but
he
really
must
have
meant
in
fact
that
the
student
ratio
was
somewhat
different.
“your
student
population
is
60-40.”
“yes
sir.”
“ultimately,
that
would
be
optimum
if
you're
going
to
eliminate
the
racial
characteristics
of
your
school
through
faculty,
knotted
to
indicate
affirmative
reply.”
and
so
when
this
was
suggested
to
the
school
superintendent
and
the
assistant
superintendent
towards
the
faculty
as
an
acceptable
ratio,
he
acquiesced
in
it
to
preferably
an
agreeable
way
of
going
about
it.
finally,
the
notion
of
numerical
ratios
is
one
which
is
entirely
suitable
for
use
by
this
board
and
indeed
based
to
those
initially
that
numbers
was
what
they
were
going.
on
656
of
the
record,
the
assistant
superintendent
says,
“well,
the
way
i'll
go
about
it
is
first
i'll
put
one
in
each
school
and
then
i'll
put
two
in
each
school
and
then
i'll
put
three
in
each
school
and
so
on
and
so
on.
so
numbers
is
not
an
unconginular
impossible
way
of
working
according
to
their
own
testimony
and
the
judge
pointed
out
indeed
in
his
opinion
that
the
formula
which
he
proposed
was
a
little
different
from
what
they
were
doing
as
founded
in
the
record
on
page
526.
now,
the
numerical
ratio
as
i
pointed
out
protects
the
board
in
two
senses.
it
protects
them
because
now
they
know
what
to
do.
it
is
less
likely
they
will
be
contempt.
it
is
less
likely
they
will
be
in
violation.
it
protects
them
also
against
depredations
by
state
authorities.
and
finally,
other
courts
have
found
this
type
of
approach
useful.
in
the
dowell
case
in
oklahoma
city,
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed
the
use
of
precisely
such
ratio
and
it
might
be
pointed
out
that
it
initially
was
suggested
by
a
panel
of
educators
that
it
is
being
used
in
other
courts
throughout
the
country
as
cited
in
our
brief.
most
importantly
however,
the
court
of
appeals
are
no
record
whatsoever
substituted
a
vapid
good
faith
standard
requirement
for
one
which
is
resting
on
a
solid
record.
this
is
based
upon
that.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
the
history
of
desegregation
in
the
courts
has
been
that
specificity
and
immediacy
bring
results
and
the
generalities
do
not.
and
this
is
the
sense
of
the
green
decision
of
this
court
of
last
year.
since
green
has
been
handed
down,
it
has
indeed
been
working.
more
important
its
effect
is
pervasive
beyond
the
judicial
system
because
its
standards
are
being
incorporated
as
the
standards
of
this
court
on
other
school
desegregation
issues
are
incorporated
into
the
guidelines
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare,
so
it
has
an
effect
beyond
the
ordinary
effect
of
stare
decisis.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
is
a
throw
back.
there's
no
justification
for
it
and
that
it
should
be
reversed.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
phelps.
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
that
been
done?
chief
justice
earl
warren
what
is
the
--
what
is
the
effect
of
that
policy
of
the
state
government
that
mr.
greenberg
just
read
a
moment
ago,
if
the
policy
of
the
state
government
being
against
doing
this
very
thing?
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
there
been
a
change?
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
there
been
a
change
in
the
state
policy?
chief
justice
earl
warren
has
it
been
announced?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i'd
like
to
hear
you
tell
us
how
it's
been
announced.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
whereas
the
governor
of
the
state
announced
in
many
way
that
it
has
changed
its
policy
in
this
regard?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
mean
a
statement
that
it's
going
to
consider
education
in
alabama
as
announcement
and
abandon
all
its
segregation
policies.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
i
thought
you
said
15
years
ago
almost
to
the
day
that
the
climate
wasn't
to
be
considered.
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
say,
my
recollection
is
that
15
years
ago
almost
to
the
day
that
brown
versus
board
of
education,
you
said
that
climate
was
not
one
of
the
things
that
should
be
considered
in
desegregation
was
to
made.
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
is
that
you
shuffle
your
elementary
teachers
as
between
white
and
black
schools?
why
can't
you
shuffle
your
junior
high
teachers
as
between
the
schools
in
the
same
with
the
high
school
teachers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
beg
your
pardon.
chief
justice
earl
warren
well,
if
teacher
jones,
a
white
person,
is
teaching
first
year
history
in
the
high
school,
a
white
high
school,
and
teacher
smith,
a
black
person
is
teaching
the
same
subject
in
the
first
year
class
in
a
black
school,
why
couldn't
--
why
could
you
just
change
those
two
teachers?
chief
justice
earl
warren
but
as
i
--
i
thought
that
judge
johnson
held
that
you
need
not
do
that
school
by
school.
you
are
to
do
it
by
the
overall
population,
isn't
that
true?
chief
justice
earl
warren
it
has
to
be
done
by
every
school?
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
be
satisfied
with
his
decree
if
it
provided
for
doing
it
on
the
basis
of
your
overall
school
population
as
distinguished
from
each
individual
school?
chief
justice
earl
warren
you
have
just
15
years
--
chief
justice
earl
warren
would
you
take
the
position
that
you
are
not
supposed
to
do
anything
until
you
have
a
court
order
compelling
you
to
do
it?
chief
justice
earl
warren
then
why
do
you
start
with
1964?
why
don't
you
go
back
to
1954?
chief
justice
earl
warren
why
should
there
be
any
difference
between
a
high
school
history
teacher
in
a
black
school
and
a
white
school
so
far
as
qualifications
are
concerned?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
argue
this
way
before
in
the
lower
courts?
chief
justice
earl
warren
did
you
or
let
me
read
from
the
court
of
appeals.
so
this
is
from
the
court
of
appeals,
yes.
on
page
757
of
the
record,
it
says,
however,
appellants
object
to
the
district
court's
order
requiring
assignment
of
teachers
on
the
ground
that
such
is
not
in
keeping
with
sound
and
quality
school
administration.
we
quote
from
appellant's
brief
and
then
it
quotes,
in
beckett
versus
school
board,
the
city
of
norfolk
virginia,
267
f.
supp.
118,
page
139.
the
court
stated
in
considering
faculty
desegregation,
“however,
in
line
with
the
most
recent
wheeler
case,
wheeler
versus
durham
city
board
of
education,
the
school
board
has
not
adopted
the
tactic
of
compelling
a
teacher
to
transfer.
moreover,
such
a
practice
would
not
be
in
accord
with
sound
educational
principle.”
did
you
argue
that
below?
chief
justice
earl
warren
how
is
that
consistent
with
what
you're
arguing
now?
chief
justice
earl
warren
i
thought
i
read
some
place
in
the
record
that
you
no
longer
have
any
problem
of
replacing
teachers
that
used
to
be,
that
you'd
have
to
have
i
don't
know
how
many,
70
or
something
like
that
every
year
but
that
now,
you
don't
have
to
do
that
because
you
have
enough
teachers
that
stay
in
the
schools?
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
phelps,
in
this
question
of
assignment,
do
you
reason
from
the
premise
that
any
teacher
who
is
qualified
to
teach
black
students
in
this
county
is
equally
qualified
to
teach
white
students?
chief
justice
earl
warren
teaching
the
same
thing.
you
start
--
your
reasoning
is
from
that
premise.
chief
justice
earl
warren
mr.
solicitor,
any
response?
chief
justice
earl
warren
very
well.
we'll
adjourn.
