those
weren't
very
meaningful
figures
that
set
a
time,
where
teachers
are
teaching
by
the
color
of
the
student.
this
is
a
question
of
faculty.
this
isn't
a
question
of
matching
faculty
to
students.
this
is
a
question
of
integrating
or
desegregating
the
faculty,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
anything
in
this
record
that
would
indicate
what
the
distribution
in
the
various
grades
is
of
white
and
negro
teachers?
overall
it's
three
to
two.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
the
distribution
between
white
and
negro
faculty
is
substantially
different
in
the
high
schools
than
in
the
grade
schools?
justice
byron

white
is
there
anything
that
indicates
the
distribution
is
substantially
different
to
three
to
two
as
between
the
first
grade
and
the
twelfth
grade
for
example
or
between
the
ninth
grade
and
the
sixth
grade?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
unless
you
can.
unless
you
can,
i
think
you
are
asking
us
to
assume
that
the
distribution
is
different
in
making
the
argument
that
you
may
have
to
distribute
teachers
or
redistribute
teachers
for
high
schools
to
grade
schools
or
from
the
sixth
grade
to
the
seventh
grade.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
can
see
that
if
all
--
if
it
just
so
happened
that
all
the
teachers
in
high
schools
and
all
the
high
schools
were
white
and
all
the
teachers
of
all
the
grade
schools
were
negro,
then
a
requirement
is
really
two
in
each
school
would
obviously
require
some
shifting
between
high
school
and
grade
school.
but
i'm
not
--
i
don't
--
i
just
like
to
know
if
there's
anything
really
helpful
in
the
record.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
your
objection,
one
of
you
objections
here,
i
agree
that's
only
one
of
them
is
that
it
may
require
shifting
teachers
into
jobs
for
which
they
are
not
qualified.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
--
and
if
that
would,
i
would
suppose
that
in
that
objection,
wasn't
obvious
in
the
district
court
when
this
provision
supposes
it
is
there.
you
could've
--
you
could've
made
some
showing
along
this
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
had
a
--
did
you
file
for
a
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
judge
johnson
modify
his
order
for
some
respect?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
your
request?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
point
out
this
particular
problem?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
wouldn't
have
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
if
judge
johnson,
i
don't
see
anything
in
here
to
indicate
that
he
would
expect
you
to
reassign
high
school
students,
high
school
or
grade
school
teachers
to
high
school.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
the
order
on
its
face
requires
that,
i
would
firstly
be
surprised
in
such
a
place
i
gather
if
you
could
stick
to
that.

you

justice

here
you
are
talkinga
about
the
(inaudible)?
justice
byron

white
may
i
ask
you,
you've
got
you
say
212
teachers
teaching
in
schools
where
their
races
are
minority.
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
i
take
it
that
you
feel
that
those
212
are
capable
of
teaching
students
of
the
opposite
race.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
don't
deny
--
you
just
don't
assert
the
court
warrants
that
the
teachers
of
one
race
can't
teach
students
of
another
race?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
relationships
are
bound
to
be
such
between
a
student
of
one
race
and
teacher
for
another
that
you
can't
have
a
decent
educational
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
object
them
to
the
district
court
at
least
consisting
that
you
tried
on
a
three
to
two
basis?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
you
know
that
some
of
these
--
you
must
be
making
a
judgment
that
--
it's
part
of
your
judgment
--
it's
part
of
your
objection
to
this
decree
that
you
are
not
permitted,
not
permitted
to
make
a
judgment
that
this
particular
black
teacher
in
this
particular
teacher
will
be
unsuccessful
teaching
students
of
the
opposite
race.
is
that
part
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
can
you
tell
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
(inauidlbe)
do
you
think
it's
the
recurring
judgment
in
your
school
system
that
a
person
--
that
a
teacher
is
not
assigned,
a
white
teacher
is
not
assigned
to
a
black
school
or
a
black
teacher
is
not

a

school

the
judgment
is
that
that

would
not
be

good
teacher
to
the
opposite
race,
is
that
a
recurring
judgment
of
your
school
system?
justice
byron

white
or
you
wanted
that
kind
of
“flexibility”?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
--
i'm
asking
about
a
specific
aspect
of
that.
you
want
a
right
to
consider
race
in
the
assignment
of
a
teacher?
justice
byron

you
don't
want
to
say
--
you
do
want
to
be
able
to
say
that
well
this
particular
white
teacher
wouldn't
be
successful
in
teaching
in
that
school.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
this
particular
black
because
of
the
racial
situation.
justice
byron

white
could
i
ask
you
this?
to
what
extent
if
you
had
resignations
to
faculty
members
which
has
resulted
the
problem
which
you
think
have
resulted
from
the
teacher
objecting
to
having
to

any?

yes

you've
been
