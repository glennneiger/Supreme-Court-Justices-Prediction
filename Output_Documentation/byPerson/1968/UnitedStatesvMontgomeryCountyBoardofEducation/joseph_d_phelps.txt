mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
solicitor
general
and
mr.
greenberg
have
stated,
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
in
public
education,
we
must
have
a
compulsory
mathematical
ratio
in
faculty
assignment.
we
would
like
you
to
bear
outset
to
emphasize
to
the
court
that
we
are
not
here
and
don't
take
the
position
of
contesting
full
faculty
desegregation.
we
recognize
and
the
montgomery
county
board
of
education
recognizes
that
full
faculty
desegregation
is
indeed
an
important
and
integral
part
in
the
overall
desegregation
process.
we
do
have
extraneously
object
to
the
compulsory
mathematical
ratio
on
the
basis
that
we
(inaudible).
we
understand
the
responsibility
of
the
board
to
be
to
assign
teachers
to
schools
throughout
the
system
so
that
no
school
is
identifiable
by
its
faculty
as
being
tailored
to
either
white
or
negro
children.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
it's
in
the
process
now,
your
honor
of
being
done
and
we
are
making
we
believe
sir
extensive
numerical
progress
is
where
this
qualitative
process.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
if
the
court
please
mr.
chief
justice,
the
data
he
read
was
in
1966
in
the
macon
county,
lee
versus
macon
county,
a
case
about
three
years
ago.
at
that
time,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
were
only
1600
students
throughout
the
whole
state
in
desegregated
situations.
we
have
more
than
that
now
and
even
in
montgomery,
alabama.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
very
definitely.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
would
say
very
definitely
and
i
can
give
the
court
some
examples.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
alright,
so
right
now.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
right
today,
or
this
week
in
the
state
of
alabama,
the
alabama
legislature's
meeting
on
a
called
special
session
that
was
called
by
a
new
governor
to
consider
an
extensive
program
for
education
that
was
presented
to
the
alabama
legislature
by
a
biracial
committee
and
here's
the
alabama
legislature
meeting
considering
recommendations
for
education
throughout
the
system
that
were
presented
to
the
governor
and
presented
to
the
legislature
by
a
fully
desegregated
or
by
a
fully
integrated
committee.
we
think
that's
enough.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
believe
that
that
is
an
announcement
in
and
of
itself.
another
announcement
as
far
as
policy
has
said
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
that
mr.
chief
justice
is
one
example.
another
example
is
this.
in
the
case
of
lee
versus
macon
county
that
mr.
gray
is
well
familiar
with,
governor
brewer
appeared
before
judge
frank
m.
johnson
and
made
the
statement
that
the
state
of
alabama
has
no
state
policy
of
segregation.
that
statement
was
made
i
believe
by
mr.
gray,
by
governor
brewer
in
judge
johnson's
court.
that
if
the
court
pleases
is
another
example.
that
one
is
in
the
montgomery
addresses
itself
to
the
court's
question
and
to
mr.
greenberg's
remark.
another
example
as
far
as
the
climate
in
alabama,
on
april
15,
1969,
a
black
person
was
appointed
on
the
school
board
itself
in
birmingham,
alabama.
we
think
that's
a
significant
development
as
far
as
the
climate
is
concerned.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
it.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
sir,
you
ask
me,
i
thought
what
changes
the
governor
had
made
in
the
problem,
i
was
attempting
sir
to
point
out
i
think
the
changes
that
have
been
made.
i
think
that
the
examples
that
i've
given
to
the
court
are
some.
another
example
is
this.
just
last
week,
a
black
athlete
at
the
university
of
alabama
who
had
just
received
a
grant
scholarship
was
asked
by
the
newspaper
concerning
racial
considerations.
at
the
scene
of
the
of
the
“school
house”
and
the
black
athlete
haven't
received
the
grant
scholarship
and
asked
about
race,
he
says,
everybody
has
got
to
be
some
color
or
i
want
to
play
basketball.
we
think
that
the
changes
that
have
made,
now
that
was
a
change
at
the
university
of
alabama,
or
change
in
the
birmingham
board
of
education
having
a
black
person
on
the
board
or
change
in
the
legislature
of
alabama
considering
the
biracial
integrated
committee
of
recommendation
in
calling
a
special
session
of
the
legislature.
mr.
chief
justice
asked
for
changes
and
i
think
those
are
changes
quoted
the
court
in
1966
quoted
in
lee
versus
macon
as
it
is.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
are
working
diligently
at
that
now.
we
don't
state
to
the
court
that
the
ultimate
objective
has
been
reached
when
i
would
say
that
measuring
and
looking
at
we
think
substantial
progress
and
i
will
get
to
its
figures
on
a
minute
but
i
think
certainly
in
the
foreseeable
future,
it's
hard
to
give
the
court
time.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
should
hope
not
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
should
hope
not
and
i
don't
think
that
it
will,
no
sir.
i
think
that
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
true.
it's
been
--
since
1954,
since
brown
versus
board
of
education
but
since
1964
when
montgomery
county
became
under
a
desegregation
program,
i
think
tremendous
tries
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
that's
correct
sir.
and
we
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
we
can't
argue
with
the
fact
that
we
had
to
do
desegregation
in
montgomery
county
prior
to
that.
we
have
to
say
that
but
we
have
to
say
that
but
we've
stated
this
court
that
we
are
going
about
changing
the
school
system
and
we
recognize
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
believe
that
these
petitioners
mr.
justice
marshall
must
(inaudible)
has
probably
already
graduated
from
school
so
it
couldn't
--
it
did
in
good,
yes
sir.
i
believe
that
it
gave
to
all
(inaudible)
or
time
in
public
school
systems
in
montgomery
or
desegregated
education.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
on
the
basis
of
making
assignments
in
the
future
years
as
we've
done
between
1967
and
today.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
i
believe,
in
the
record,
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
we
asked
judge
johnson
sir
to
stay
his
order
pending
appeal.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
in
essence,
yes
sir
because
he
gave
us
some
more
time
in
fact
in
substitute
teachers
and
that
was
--
it's
not
formally
by
a
motion,
no
sir,
but
informal
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
we
are
asking
this
court
mr.
justice
marshall
for
more
than
more
time.
we
are
asking
to
be
able
to
assign
our
faculty
and
stay
according
to
the
qualification
of
the
individual
as
well
as
to
remove
the
identifiability
of
the
school.
that's
what
we're
asking
this
court.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
in
answer
to
the
justice's
prior
question,
it
would
accomplished
before
the
children
that
the
justice
mentioned
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
in
representing
the
board,
i
have
to
talk
to
the
educators
on
that
question
and
i'm
told
that
professional
educator
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
sir?
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
as
far
percentages
are
concerned,
it's
often
difficult
from
what
standpoint
or
quality
education
to
answer
that.
we
think
that
the
test
is
when
a
parent
or
a
child
looks
at
a
school,
is
that
school
identified
as
being
either
for
black
or
white?
we
think
mr.
justice
marshall
that
quality
placement
is
more
important
than
numerical
placement.
for
example,
if
we
put
a
black
teacher
or
white
teacher
that's
well
qualified
for
the
job,
in
a
particular
school
and
if
that
teacher
is
in
fact
qualified,
that
teacher,
the
black
or
all
white
teacher
in
the
black
or
white
school
in
a
desegregated
assignment
will
become
looked
upon
as
a
teacher,
as
a
quality
educator
and
not
as
either
black
or
white.
that's
true
we
think
on
identifiability
in
schools
and
we
can
get
that
if
the
court
please
by
quality,
whereas,
if
we
assign
unqualified
teachers
either
black
or
white
in
desegregated
assignments,
they
will
remain
black
or
white
forever.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
that's
true
justice
marshall
but
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
that's
true.
they
are
qualified
to
teach
in
the
subjects
that
they
have
trained
to
be
teachers.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
high
school
science
teacher
mr.
marshall
--
justice
marshall
is
certainly
not
qualified
to
teach
an
elementary
child
how
to
read.
and
if
we
get
into
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
right.
if
we
had
to
meet
a
racial
quota
of
60-40
in
the
elementary
grades,
we
would
have
to
take
some
of
the
teachers
from
the
elementary
grades
and
move
them
elsewhere
in
order
to
get
that
quota,
i'll
bring
them
in
to
the
elementary
junior
high
grades
from
some
other
face
of
our
system.
here's
what
the
60-40
overall
doesn't
consider.
we've
got
different
ratios
of
white
to
blacks
in
high
schools
than
we're
doing
in
junior
high,
different
ratio
to
white
to
black
in
junior
high
as
in
grammar
school.
now,
if
we
have
to
make
a
racial
quota,
we
would
have
to
come
along
and
take
them
out
of
elementary,
put
them
into
high
school
throughout
the
high
school
and
put
them
in
the
elementary.
now,
we
have
specific
examples
and
that
appears
from
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
that
would
be
a
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
the
government
and
the
plaintiffs,
if
the
court
please,
have
asked
for
a
random
redistribution.
now,
random
redistribution
to
accomplish
a
60-40
overall
ratio
would
have
to
be
in
each
particular
high
school
level,
junior
high
school
level,
elementary
level.
they
asked
for
a
random
redistribution
and
it
just
cannot
from
the
administrative
standpoint
were.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
alright
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
let
me
say
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
right
now
for
example,
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i'm
saying,
we've
got
different
quotas
or
different
actual
percentages
in
our
various
schools.
for
example
in
junior
high
school,
it
might
well
be
that
we've
got
70-30
instead
of
60-40.
if
we
had
to
come
along
and
we
would
have
more
of
one
then
we'd
be
able
to
use
in
the
60-40
and
we'd
have
to
have
something
to
do
with
those
teachers.
we'd
either
have
to
move
them
up
to
high
school
and
that
would
create
positions
that
would
have
to
be
found
for
teachers
in
other
areas.
it
would
just
create
mass
confusion.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
i
think
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
exhibit
to
our
brief,
we
are
meeting
a
one
to
five,
approximately
a
substantial
one
to
five.
we
got
more
latitude
of
course
if
the
court
please
and
we
would
have
a
three
to
two
overall.
and
i
think
this
is
significant
to
bring
out
at
this
point.
this
racial
ration
requirement
was
not
asked
for
in
the
plaintiffs
or
the
government's
motions
before
judge
johnson.
the
first
time
it
came
up
was
in
the
suggested
decree
prepared
by
the
governor.
therefore,
the
district
court
had
no
opportunity
to
look
into
these.
we
say
impossible
affix
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
believe
we
would
have
to
be
further
in
order
for
the
record
to
show
that
someone
would
have
to
be
familiar
with
the
individual
schools.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
don't
believe
sir
that
it
doesn't.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes
sir.
i'm
saying
that
that
is
the
case
and
is
going
to
be
the
case
in
varying
degrees
from
year
to
year.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
it
is
for
this
reason.
certainly,
it
will
appear
from
the
record
and
from
the
reports
that
have
been
filed
over
the
years
that
varying
numbers
of
students
will
attend
varying
schools
each
year.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well
no
sir.
i
can't
state
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
can't
state
to
the
court
that
it's
specifically
in
the
printed
record
because
we
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
we
are
going
to
be
faced
with
this
racial
requirement
and
it
was
not
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
when
neither
the
plaintiffs
nor
the
government's
motion
for
further
relief
and
the
first
time,
we
were
faced
with
a
racial
ratio
was
in
the
suggested
order
as
prepared
by
the
government.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
if
it
was
just
those
two
mr.
justice
warren
involved
here
but
if
you
got
a
racial
requirement
that
you're
having
to
meet,
you
got
to
have
60-40
in
your
black
school,
60%
white
and
40%
black.
you
are
going
to
have
to
move
more
than
just
those
two
teachers
and
it's
going
to
get
into
a
process
of
musical
chairs
of
just
shifting
teachers
around
in
corners
of
bodies
and
yet
it
cannot.
this
is
to
be
the
best
thing
for
quality
education.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes
sir
and
that's
something
that
the
government
and
the
plaintiff
stated
differently
in
their
petition
for
certiorari
than
it
did
in
their
briefs
on
the
merits.
judge
johnson's
order
says
that
you've
got
to
have
in
each
school
the
same
ratio
of
blacks
to
white
as
the
overall
faculty
composition
demand
and
that
was
not
presented.
it
was
presented
as
mr.
chief
justice
says
in
petition
for
certiorari
within
the
briefs,
they
did
say
what
judge
johnson
ordered
and
it
was
in
each
schools.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
composed
from
mathematical
ratios
are
certainly
an
innovation
in
public
education.
we
think
this
is
a
very
far
reaching
decree
in
effect
and
we
think
that
certainly,
a
great
deal
of
thoughts
should
go
into
it
and
i
think
that
we
should
have
the
opportunity
to
present
to
the
district
court
the
effects
of
the
various
and
i've
outlined
some
of
my
line
some
more
the
effects
of
this
arbitrary,
we
say,
preconceived
mathematical
ratios.
we
say
they
are
unwise,
arbitrary
and
educationally
unsound.
in
hobson
versus
hansen
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
i
think
and
i
will
get
to
the
progress
that
we
made
in
fact
of
the
desegregation
if
the
court
please.
in
one
year,
the
montgomery
county
board
of
education,
in
1966-67
was
the
first
year
that
pursuant
to
court
order,
we
went
in
to
faculty
desegregation.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
alright.
well,
i
think
in
any
that
whether
is
1954,
mr.
justice,
or
whether
it's
1964,
we
have
212
full
time
faculty
members
teaching
in
minority
assignments
today,
111
blacks
and
34
white
schools
in
a
101
whites
and
39
black
school,
approximately
in
a
one
to
five
ratio
and
we
state
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
that
mr.
justice
is
right.
i
think
what
we
was
tried
before
is
regardless
of
whether
it
be
a
formally
or
predominantly
black
or
white
school.
we
are
striving
for
having
the
faculty
in
each
school
regardless
of
racial
or
non-racial
composition
as
not
being
identified.
i
agree
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
don't
believe
so.
we
would
have
to
take
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
mr.
justice
white,
i
can't
say
it
specifically
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
not
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
this
is
an
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
if
--
this
is
an
example
of
an
area
that
the
district
court
had
no
opportunity
to
get
into
because
neither
the
plaintiffs
nor
the
government
asked
for
a
racial
ratio
ahead
of
this
hearing
and
we
had
no
opportunity
to
present
these
factors
to
the
court.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
we
had
no
idea
that
a
ratio,
a
faculty
ratio
quota
was
going
to
come
out
of
this.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
as
i
see
it
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
question,
we
did
not
formally,
no
sir.
we
discussed
it
with
the
court
and
we
filed
a
petition
to
stay
pending
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes
sir.
we
filed
after
we
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
of
course,
this
is
an
example
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
after
we
had
an
informal
discussion
and
pointed
out
the
problems
that
was
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
we
didn't
pointed
out
in
the
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
in
detail
that
we're
pointing
it
out
to
this
court.
we
just
didn't
have
the
opportunity
and
the
time
to
study
with
our
people.
we
had
an
order
that
it
was
just
in
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
if
we
think
that's
a
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
we
think
that
mathematical
ratios
are
dangerous
in
public
education
and
that
is
one
of
the
examples.
and
one
of
the
reasons
we
say
we
had
no
opportunity
to
go
into
this
another
problem
that
we
have
in
racial
ratios
and
in
fact
the
assignment
no
one
the
school
board
nor
the
court
can
control
a
teacher
or
an
employment,
his
or
her
employment.
teachers
could
resign,
go
to
another
school
system
or
go
into
another
means
of
employment.
so
here
we've
got
a
standard
on
the
employment
of
faculties,
this
gives
to
something
that
the
school
board
nor
the
court
has
anything
to
do
with.
a
teacher
can
resign
if
she
wants
to.
she
can
go
into
another
field
of
endeavor,
he
or
she
can.
unfortunately
in
the
state
of
alabama,
we
don't
have
the
financial
resources
to
hold
a
lot
(inaudible)
money.
we
have
to
treat
them
as
professional
people,
so
we
think
another
drawback
on
a
racial
ratio
requirement
is
that
you
are
tying
the
standard
to
something
that
neither
the
courts
nor
the
school
board
can
control.
another
point
that
we
bring
out
and
we
say
shows
the
lack
of
wisdom
in
such
a
proposal,
if
your
state,
if
it's
tied
to
the
composition
in
the
entire
faculty,
it
would
inevitably
fair
from
one
school
district
to
another.
for
example,
in
birmingham,
alabama,
there
are
25-26%
black
and
74%
white.
in
oklahoma
city,
there
are
14%
black,
86%
white.
washington
d.c.,
78%
black
and
12%
white.
you
got
a
yardstick
that
varies
from
state
to
state
from
district
to
district
and
even
within
the
various
school
districts
within
a
given
state
and
was
pointed
out
a
minute
ago,
it
varies
between
your
junior
high
school
and
elementary
levels
even
within
the
same
school
district.
and
it
varies
from
year
to
year.
and
we
think
that
your
state
is
a
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir
and
that's
hopefully
what
all
of
the
schools
are
headed
for.
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out
though
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
we
feel
that
it
is
more
than
that
on
the
current
statistics.
all
current
statistics
are
i
think
we
see
it
and
we
got
212
full
time
classroom
faculty
teachers
and
now
the
superintendent
in
his
testimony
before
this
order
said
that
he
was
going
to
have
an
excess
of
a
hundred
and
he
has
worked
diligently
and
in
his
statement
on
of
this
court
that
he's
going
to
continue
to
do
it
without
the
imposition
or
mathematical
ratio
that
certainly
cannot
be
beneficial
to
quality
education
when
you
assign
teachers
as
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
and
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes
sir
and
the
fifth
circuit
made
that
clear
that
the
majority
opinion
emphatically
said
that
you
had
to
compulsory
assign
but
we
say
alright.
but
in
this
compulsory
assignment,
let's
take
the
qualification,
the
individuality
of
a
teacher
into
consideration
if
you
lose
that,
if
the
court
please,
in
public
education
is
going
to
be
at
the
expense
of
school
children
throughout
the
nation
regardless
of
race.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
don't
think
there
is
but
i
think
when
you
have
to
assign
a
teacher
on
the
basis
of
meeting
a
quota
instead
of
assigning
a
teacher
on
the
basis
of
qualification
and
after
careful
consideration
of
what
she
was
teaching.
for
example,
a
science
teacher
for
a
science
teacher,
that
sounds
alright
but
if
this
science
teacher
had
been
teaching
physics
at
one
school,
you
can't
send
over,
it
wouldn't
be
right
to
send
him
over
and
teach
biology
in
another
--
or
the
other
side
or
if
a
teacher
had
been
teaching
general
science
in
a
white
school,
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
fair
to
the
teacher
nor
to
the
child
to
send
it
to
a
black
school
to
teach
physics
and
those
are
all
elements
that
they've
got
to
come
in
to
faculty
placement.
so
i
say
yes
to
the
judge,
we
don't
make
a
distinction
between
a
white
and
a
black
teacher
on
the
basis
of
qualification
but
what
the
teacher
is
trained
to
do.
if
it's
a
science
teacher
and
a
science
teacher
change
from
one
school
to
another
would
meet
a
quota
but
if
that
science
teacher
had
been
teaching
general
science
in
white
school,
it
wouldn't
be
fair
to
the
teacher
nor
to
the
children
to
teach
physics
into
other
school.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
not
as
much
narrow
as
it
has
been.
i
can't
say
that
all
the
best
teachers
have
gone
but
they
are
leaving
certainly,
that's
true
to
some
extent.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes
sir,
that's
true.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
it
would
be
your
honor
unrealistic
not
to
say
that
would
be
true.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
would
say
substantially
so,
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
alright
sir,
yes.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
warren's
question,
if
those
were
the
only
two,
as
i
said,
the
only
two
teachers
that
you
can
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
alright
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
what
about
this
sir
if
the
a
teacher
at
one
school
that
it
shows
him
to
take
physics
and
not
(inaudible)
then
the
general
science
teacher
would
be
in
the
position
of
teaching
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
as
far
as
one
teacher
is
concerned,
there
wouldn't
be
but
if
we
got
a
three
to
two
ratio
overall
and
we've
got
to
make
it
in
the
high
school,
elementary
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
i'll
say
this
to
the
court
that
mathematical
ratios
are
inherently
problematic
in
public
education
and
i've
tried
to
point
out
some
of
them
and
there
are
many,
many
more
and
i
think
judge
skelly
wright
in
hobson
versus
hansen
recognized
it
when
after
discussing
dowell
and
kier
and
other
cases
cited.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
it
is
mr.
justice
marshall
in
so
far
as
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
after
discussing
dowell
and
kier,
justice
wright
said
this.
justice
wright
--
judge
wright
said
there
will
be
an
abundance
of
opportunity
later
for
advisory
argument
on
the
merits
and
demerits
of
the
ends
and
means
concerning
teacher
and
of
race.
he
said
that
in
hobson
versus
hansen
after
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
that
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
i
think
in
the
school
system
in
montgomery
county,
alabama,
we
are
striving
to
cope
with
the
problem
and
to
solve
it
and
we
state
to
the
court
that
we
will
solve
it.
we
will
solve
it
in
student
desegregation
and
we'll
solve
it
in
fact
that
desegregation
without
the
imposition
of
these
compulsory
mathematical
ratios.
the
government
in
brief
and
in
argument
have
said
that
this
is
only
--
that
the
mathematical
ratio
requirement
is
remedial
and
not
for
perpetuity.
i
suppose
that
they
are
seeking
to
make
the
distinction
between
a
de
facto
and
a
de
jure
public
school
system
but
when
it
comes
to
teachers,
i
failed
to
see
the
distinction
between
de
facto
and
de
jure
or
certainly
it
makes
no
difference
as
far
as
the
neighborhood
or
fortuitous
housing
patterns
as
to
what
teachers
are
assigned
to
what
schools
and
i
think
that
even
more
in
a
de
facto
situation,
what
we
call,
what's
been
called
de
facto
faculty
integration
is
more
important.
we
can't
see
either
teachers
there,
they
are
not,
if
they
are
not,
they
have
the
school
as
identifiable
as
patterned
for
one
particular
race
or
another,
we
think
that
the
problem
exists
whether
you
call
it
de
facto
or
whether
you
call
it
de
jure,
the
teachers
are
either
there.
it's
either
identifiable
as
white
or
identifiable
as
black.
if
they
say
it's
not
for
perpetuity
if
a
charge
of
racial
imbalance
is
made,
continued
to
be
made,
if
the
charges
of
racial
identifiability
is
made,
the
perpetuity
of
the
racial
ratio
requirement
would
exist
just
as
long
as
these
charges
are
made.
and
we
say
that
we
are
going
about
in
montgomery,
alabama
to
provide
non-racially
identified
faculties
in
each
schools
and
we
say
that
it's
unwise,
educationally
unsound
and
not
consistent
with
quality
education
to
have
a
mathematical
ratio
and
i've
tried
to
explain.
but
if
we're
doing
it
and
if
we're
getting
the
job
done
as
the
district
court
noted
in
the
opinion
that's
been
quoted
from,
judge
johnson
said
that
you
are
doing
as
much
without
the
racial
requirement
or
as
what
you
tell
us
you
do
is
the
court
requiring
you
to
do
anyway
at
record
page
562.
what's
exactly
required
in
the
court
order
is
very
little
that
it's
any
more
than
the
school
board
by
his
testimony
and
by
the
school
that
we're
going
to
do
anyway.
but
we
planned
to
assign
faculty
and
staff,
so
the
schools
are
not
identifiable
racially
and
also
to
carefully
consider
the
quality
placement.
teaching
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
is
uniformly
recognized
as
an
art
and
least
are
professional
people.
the
individuality
in
imparting
knowledge
from
one
to
another
is
an
intensely
personal
endeavor
and
it's
just
not
can't
possibly
be
in
the
best
interest
of
public
education
for
blacks
or
whites,
to
assign
these
people
according
to
color,
to
assign
professional
teachers
according
to
their
bodies
and
not
as
to
individuality.
now,
we
recognize
that
we
must
foremost
in
our
minds
keep
the
consideration
of
desegregating
the
faculties
and
we
state
to
the
court
that
we
are
but
we
ask
for
the
opportunity
to
desegregate
our
faculties
and
do
it
consistently
with
quality
education.
and
as
the
solicitor
general
commented
candidly
so
i
thought,
the
montgomery
county
board
has
made
significant
progress.
we
got
significant
progress
we
say
in
faculty
desegregation
and
in
students
and
we
state
to
the
courts
that
we're
going
to
continue
but
we
ask
for
the
opportunity
to
continue
with
our
constitutional
requirements
to
desegregate
and
at
the
same
time,
let
us
consider
this
vital,
the
critical
element
of
the
individuality
in
faculty
assignment.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
did
if
the
court
please,
before
the
court
of
appeals
but
again,
i
didn't
have
an
opportunity
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes
sir
and
i
argued
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
it
is
in
the
context
mr.
justice
of
what
we're
arguing
at
the
footnote
on
the
record
at
page
757,
the
court
of
appeals
says
this,
“although
appellants
consistently
argued
a
voluntary
assignment
of
teachers
and
staff
and
contend
that
sound
and
quality
school
administration
favored
voluntary
assignment,
the
following
statement
has
found
from
the
brief
of
appellant.”
and
we
stated
this
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
court
below.
these
appellants
fully
recognized
that
they
have
the
affirmative
duty
to
desegregate
the
faculty
throughout
the
system
to
the
end
of
the
pattern
of
teacher
assignment
to
any
particular
school
shall
not
be
identifiable
as
tailored
for
a
heavy
concentration
of
either
negro
or
white
pupils
in
the
schools.
the
appellant
further
recognized
that
they
have
a
legal
right
to
compel
faculty
assignment
if
voluntary
placement
is
not
effective
and
we
ask
therefore
an
opportunity
to
volunteer
the
placement
and
of
course
that's
if
it
can't
be
done.
if
you
can
have
a
teacher
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no
sir.
the
court
of
appeals
said
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no
sir
and
the
court
of
appeals
emphatically
said
that
we
must
assign
teachers
and
what
we
will
continue
to
do
though
we'll
continue
to
have
them
volunteer
if
we
can
do
it
inconsistently
without
mandate
of
complete
faculty
desegregation.
if
we
can't
then
we're
going
to
assign
but
we're
going
to
try
to
have
volunteers.
if
we
can't
get
the
job
done
that
way,
we'll
move
in
to
assignment.
of
course,
every
teacher
that
comes
into
the
certain
system
now
is
told
and
no
one
in
certain
terms
did
she
cannot
come
to
work
without
the
clear
understanding
that
she
can
be
assigned
to
any
school
in
the
system
whether
it
be
formally
white
or
black
school.
we
think
that
the
progress
that
we
made
in
the
area
of
segregation
in
montgomery
county
leans
credence
to
our
statements
to
the
court
of
our
good
intent.
the
district
court
on
five
occasions
has
pointed
out
in
the
court
of
appeals
order
complemented
the
montgomery
county
board
of
education
on
its
efforts
in
desegregation.
in
september
1967,
the
hearing
that
was
the
start
of
the
very
hearing
that
is
before
the
court
now.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
they
were
placed
if
the
court
please
to
the
best
of
our
ability
in
accord
with
quality
criteria.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no
sir,
i
certainly
do
not.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no
sir,
as
i
say
it
to
the
court,
--
as
i
say
it
to
court
early,
i
believe
that
if
we
are
allowed
to
make
these
assignments
based
on
individual
quality,
based
on
individual
consideration,
it
wouldn't
be
long
before
that
teacher
is
looked
upon
as
not
black
or
not
white
but
it
looked
upon
and
respected
as
a
professional
educator
and
that
might
--
so
i
might
say
that's
optimistic
but
i
think
it
already
happened
in
the
black
athlete
that's
going
to
the
university
of
alabama
in
a
grant
scholarship.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
would
say
that
it's
certainly
that's
part
of
it.
i
think
the
overall
--
i've
tried
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
because
the
judge
as
i
said
overall
and
i
tried
to
point
out
specifics.
in
the
area
of
faculty
placement,
if
teachers
are
assigned
according
to
quotas,
according
to
percentages,
it's
just
inevitably
is
going
to
lose
sight
of
the
critical
individuality
in
teachers
and
i
gave
the
examples
that
i've
given
a
while
ago
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
i've
tried
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i'm
not
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
mr.
justice
white's
question.
i'd
say
this.
we
want
to
be
able
to
consider
the
individual
quality.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
in
that
particular
white
school
or
black
school.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
don't
believe
that
the
racial
consideration
is
controlling.
i
think
the
ability
of
the
teacher
regardless
of
race,
the
training
of
the
teacher
regardless
of
race,
the
teaching
certificate
of
the
teacher
regardless
of
race,
what
the
teacher
had
been
teaching
for
the
last
ten
years
regardless
of
race,
those
were
the
things
we
want
to
consider
and
we
stated
in
all
sincerity,
if
we
have
a
ratio
and
they
say,
“well,
it
is
not
for
perpetuity.
it's
only
remedial
and
the
judge
didn't
mean
for
you
to
do
it
all
it
want.”
we
say
that
let
us
try
to
get
the
non-identifiability
corrected,
get
the
problem
solved
before
such
as
this.
we
say
it's
never
going
to
be
the
same
but
let
us
--
we
state
that
we're
going
to
do
it,
we're
in
the
process
of
doing
it,
the
objective
we
see,
we're
accomplishing
it.
we
say
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes.
quite
extensively
at
the
outset.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
would
think
so
particularly
in
the
summer
of
1967
and
not
as
much
in
the
summer
of
1968.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
not
as
whether
we
would
like
to.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
we've
been
able
to
get
them
to
the
standpoint
that
we
will
accomplish
what
we
have
here
but
if
they
wouldn't
for
resignations,
if
there
wasn't
for
just
saying
i
won't
teach
in
your
system,
i'll
go
to
birmingham
where
there's
not
that
much,
so
i'll
go
to
mountain
brook,
alabama
where
there's
none.
or
if
it
hadn't
been
to
that,
we'd
have
a
substantial
mode,
if
it
wasn't
for
resignations
or
refusal
to
take,
we
would
have
it.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
more
resignations,
yes.
i
think
we
saw
some
after
the
district
court
order.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
now,
mr.
justice
warren,
the
record
shows
that
there's
probably
a
little
less
than
10%
faculty
turnover
a
year
and
that
would
be
new
ones
coming
in
and
i
think
the
surge
of
students
firing
the
old
ones
is
not
the
problem
that
it
was
some
years
ago.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
they're
teaching
the
same
thing.
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
would
say
in
answer
to
that
yes.
and
one
other
objection,
i'd
like
to
say
as
far
as
we
say
that
the
mathematical
ratio
requirement
is
unwarranted
because
of
our
progress,
because
of
the
district
court's
--
the
court
of
appeals'
specific
directives
that
faculty
desegregation
must
be
accomplished
without
delay
or
we
had
affirmatively
said
he
had
to
assign
a
voluntary
assignments,
it
didn't
work.
we
say
that
in
a
remedial
read
as
being
handed
down
by
the
court
of
appeals,
we
say
it's
unconstitutional
hereto
and
we
think
it
would
be
dangerous.
no
mathematical
ratio
has
been
required
that
we
know
about
that
would
require
juries
to
mirror
the
racial
composition
of
a
community.
no
court
has
said
that
we
know
about
that
government
agencies
have
to
hire
according
to
racial
ratio
or
that
the
school
chairman
would
have
to
be
assigned
according
to
racial
ratios
and
in
fact
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
specifically
says
that
they
shouldn't
be
assigned
to
eliminate
racial
imbalance
and
in
the
area
of
hiring
on
jury
system,
we
feel
like
it
that
it
points
out
the
lack
of
wisdom
and
the
inherent
dangerousness
that
we
have
here.
just
a
touch
to
another
minute
on
our
statistics,
in
addition
to
the
212
full
time
faculty
assignments
that
we
have,
that's
in
every
school
but
one
in
our
system
has
a
desegregated
faculty.
the
only
school
that
does
not
is
a
three
room
rural
school
down
in
pine
level,
alabama.
it
only
has
three
teachers
but
they've
had
black
substitute
teachers.
now
student
teachers,
there
are
48.
out
of
262,
48
student
teachers
teaching
in
minority
assignments,
24
white
in
seven
black
schools
and
24
black
in
12
white
schools.
there
are
48
in
19
schools.
in
substitute
teachers,
substitute
teachers
according
to
the
report
that
we
filed
on
these,
some
of
the
15
in
1968
and
according
to
a
letter
that
we
received
from
the
district
court,
though
reports
have
been
sent
up
here,
701
days
have
been
taught
by
minority
teachers
as
substitute
teachers.
318
days
taught
by
white
substitutes
and
18
predominantly
black
schools.
300
days
taught
by
blacks
in
30
predominantly
white
schools
or
701
taught
in
desegregated
assignments
and
have
a
total
of
2516
in
48
schools.
excuse
me.
two
schools
in
our
system
didn't
have
any
substitute
teachers
between
september
15
and
all
substitute
teachers
are
dated
from
september
15
to
december
15.
substitute
teachers
present
a
terrific
problem
and
that
the
teacher
will
call
7:30
or
8
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
say
i'm
sick
and
the
principal
has
to
get
on
the
phone
and
find
somebody
and
get
them
out
there.
it's
a
burden
and
we
think
the
progress
that
we
made
there
are
substantial.
(inaudible)
is
training
programs
throughout
the
system
had
been
desegregated
and
we
think
that
that's
really
an
important.
here,
our
teachers
of
both
races
who
are
experts
in
the
field
were
teachers
or
desegregated
faculty
audience
in
both
white
and
black
schools
and
we
think
that
that
certainly
lay
in
good
ground
where
toward
the
continued
progress
that
we
stated
to
the
court
that
we're
going
to
make
and
they
do
that
in
a
meeting
in
a
white
school
one
time
and
in
a
black
school
the
next.
teachers
are
assigned
to
other
schools
for
observation
of
classes,
to
see
a
more
experienced
math
teacher
to
teach
that
class
and
that's
not
completely
on
an
integrated
basis.
we
think
that
again
is
important.
administrative
councils
have
been
completely
desegregated.
faculty
meetings
have
been
completely
desegregated.
administrative
councils
went
over
the
school.
administrative
staffs
meet
one
week
in
a
black
school
and
the
next
week
in
a
white
school.
we
state
to
the
court
that
the
progress
that
we
made
and
has
been
noted
by
the
district
court
and
it
wasn't
that
an
empty
phrase
when
judge
frank
m.
johnson
told
the
school
board
in
1967
i
believe
and
1966
that
complemented
the
board
by
operating
a
school
system
as
professional
educators
and
not
as
politicians.
i
think
that's
significant.
it's
significant
like
i
started
to
say
a
moment
ago.
in
september
of
1967,
four
months
before
the
order
that
we
had
in
court
about,
judge
johnson
stated
that
it
complemented
the
board
again
as
pointed
out
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
saved
this
from
the
bench
on
september
5,
1967.
they're
dealing
here
with
the
school
system
that
you
haven't
had
to
take
the
appellate
court
a
single
time
since
you
started.
it's
the
only
system
in
the
state
that
you
haven't
had
to
do
at
all.
they
have
done
what
they
have
done
in
good
faith
and
they
have
done
ahead
than
most
of
your
other
systems
in
every
field.
we
think
that
that
again
is
evidence
of
our
progress
in
substantial
ways
what
we
say
we're
going
to
do
and
additionally
when
judge
johnson
said
and
complemented
the
board
and
said
that
he
would
recommend
other
school
systems
to
emulate
the
conduct
of
the
montgomery
county
board,
that's
not
an
empty
phrase.
we
say
to
the
court
that
we
made
progress.
the
remedial
writ
had
been
handed
down
by
the
court
of
appeals.
we
say
that
we
recognize
and
we
are
the
first
to
recognize
that
the
ultimate
objectives
have
been
reached.
we
say
we're
working
on
it.
we're
on
the
process
of
accomplishing
it.
we
say
that
we
will
reach
them
for
the
purposes
of
desegregating
our
school
system
and
compliance
with
the
green
case,
with
bradley
case,
with
rogers
versus
paul
but
also
consistently
with
quality
education
for
the
best
interest
of
white
children
and
black
children
alike.
we
think
that
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
the
particular
objection
judge
is
that
we
have
to
have
a
ratio
in
faculty
assignment
and
we
say
when
teachers
are
assigned
to
meet
a
ratio
instead
of
to
meet
quality
education
and
instead
to
remedy
identifiableness
of
the
schools
that
you
lose
quality
education
for
whites
and
blacks
alike.
we
say
that
racial
quotas
are
inherently
dangerous
in
public
education,
that
they
are
tied
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
we're
moving
toward
this.
we
are
moving
toward
the
faculty
in
each
school
being
not
identifiable
as
either
white
or
colored
for
the
students
to
go
into
that
school.
when
a
child
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
we
can
do
that
judge
the
same
way
that
we've
done
in
the
last
year
by
assigning
blacks
to
white
schools
consistently
with
quality
education
and
white
students,
blacks
to
whites
and
whites
black,
not
to
meet
the
quota
but
to
remove
the
identifiableness
of
either
a
black
or
white
school
in
so
far
as
the
children
are
concerned.
and
i
tried
to
go
into
the
specific
reasons
that
we
say
specifically
that
the
invocation
of
a
compulsory
ratio
on
top
of
what
we
say
we're
going
to
do
is
unwarranted,
it's
unnecessary,
it's
unconstitutional
and
it
puts
an
unwise
detrimental
burden
on
quality
education
and
we
think
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
probably
the
jefferson
davis
high
school.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
it's
situated
on
carter
hill
road
in
montgomery,
alabama.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
another
school,
mr.
robinson
just
called
my
attention
to
was
the
harrison
school
on
the
southern
(inaudible)
in
montgomery.
harrison
school
--
let's
see
--
the
3
black
teachers
and
15
white.
the
jefferson
davis
school,
7
black
and
29
white.
generally,
on
the
basis,
those
are
two
examples.
and
to
some
it
may
be
more
but
generally
one
out
of
five
throughout
the
system
are
teaching
a
whole
class,
so
in
our
schools
where
--
if
it
is
a
predominantly
white
student
population,
approximately
one
out
of
five
of
the
teachers
in
that
school
are
black
teachers.
does
that
answer
the
judge's
question?
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i'm
just
an
attorney
sir.
but
i
do
state
that
we've
discussed
this
with
our
board
and
the
statements
and
assurances
that
i
make
to
this
court
are
from
the
board
of
education
of
montgomery
county,
the
same
people
that
judge
johnson
said
were
running
the
school
system
as
professional
educators
and
not
as
politicians.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
it's
been
favorable.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
i
think
they
tend
to
communicate
well
and
i
think
a
reason
justice
black
that
it
has
been
favorable
is
that
we
made
these
assignments
based
on
considerations
of
what
the
teacher
had
been
teaching
and
what
she
was
assigned
to
and
she's
qualified
for
what
she's
doing
and
those
white
children
are
going
to
look
at
that
black
teacher
not
as
a
black
or
white
but
as
a
good
teacher
and
likely
they
will
respect
her
as
a
good
teacher.
and
i
think
that's
what
we
would
like
to
accomplish.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
do
so.
i
think
we're
going
to
move
further.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
solicitor
general
and
mr.
greenberg
have
stated,
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
in
public
education,
we
must
have
a
compulsory
mathematical
ratio
in
faculty
assignment.
we
would
like
you
to
bear
outset
to
emphasize
to
the
court
that
we
are
not
here
and
don't
take
the
position
of
contesting
full
faculty
desegregation.
we
recognize
and
the
montgomery
county
board
of
education
recognizes
that
full
faculty
desegregation
is
indeed
an
important
and
integral
part
in
the
overall
desegregation
process.
we
do
have
extraneously
object
to
the
compulsory
mathematical
ratio
on
the
basis
that
we
(inaudible).
we
understand
the
responsibility
of
the
board
to
be
to
assign
teachers
to
schools
throughout
the
system
so
that
no
school
is
identifiable
by
its
faculty
as
being
tailored
to
either
white
or
negro
children.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
it's
in
the
process
now,
your
honor
of
being
done
and
we
are
making
we
believe
sir
extensive
numerical
progress
is
where
this
qualitative
process.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
if
the
court
please
mr.
chief
justice,
the
data
he
read
was
in
1966
in
the
macon
county,
lee
versus
macon
county,
a
case
about
three
years
ago.
at
that
time,
mr.
chief
justice,
there
were
only
1600
students
throughout
the
whole
state
in
desegregated
situations.
we
have
more
than
that
now
and
even
in
montgomery,
alabama.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
very
definitely.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
would
say
very
definitely
and
i
can
give
the
court
some
examples.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
alright,
so
right
now.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
right
today,
or
this
week
in
the
state
of
alabama,
the
alabama
legislature's
meeting
on
a
called
special
session
that
was
called
by
a
new
governor
to
consider
an
extensive
program
for
education
that
was
presented
to
the
alabama
legislature
by
a
biracial
committee
and
here's
the
alabama
legislature
meeting
considering
recommendations
for
education
throughout
the
system
that
were
presented
to
the
governor
and
presented
to
the
legislature
by
a
fully
desegregated
or
by
a
fully
integrated
committee.
we
think
that's
enough.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
believe
that
that
is
an
announcement
in
and
of
itself.
another
announcement
as
far
as
policy
has
said
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
that
mr.
chief
justice
is
one
example.
another
example
is
this.
in
the
case
of
lee
versus
macon
county
that
mr.
gray
is
well
familiar
with,
governor
brewer
appeared
before
judge
frank
m.
johnson
and
made
the
statement
that
the
state
of
alabama
has
no
state
policy
of
segregation.
that
statement
was
made
i
believe
by
mr.
gray,
by
governor
brewer
in
judge
johnson's
court.
that
if
the
court
pleases
is
another
example.
that
one
is
in
the
montgomery
addresses
itself
to
the
court's
question
and
to
mr.
greenberg's
remark.
another
example
as
far
as
the
climate
in
alabama,
on
april
15,
1969,
a
black
person
was
appointed
on
the
school
board
itself
in
birmingham,
alabama.
we
think
that's
a
significant
development
as
far
as
the
climate
is
concerned.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
it.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
sir,
you
ask
me,
i
thought
what
changes
the
governor
had
made
in
the
problem,
i
was
attempting
sir
to
point
out
i
think
the
changes
that
have
been
made.
i
think
that
the
examples
that
i've
given
to
the
court
are
some.
another
example
is
this.
just
last
week,
a
black
athlete
at
the
university
of
alabama
who
had
just
received
a
grant
scholarship
was
asked
by
the
newspaper
concerning
racial
considerations.
at
the
scene
of
the
of
the
“school
house”
and
the
black
athlete
haven't
received
the
grant
scholarship
and
asked
about
race,
he
says,
everybody
has
got
to
be
some
color
or
i
want
to
play
basketball.
we
think
that
the
changes
that
have
made,
now
that
was
a
change
at
the
university
of
alabama,
or
change
in
the
birmingham
board
of
education
having
a
black
person
on
the
board
or
change
in
the
legislature
of
alabama
considering
the
biracial
integrated
committee
of
recommendation
in
calling
a
special
session
of
the
legislature.
mr.
chief
justice
asked
for
changes
and
i
think
those
are
changes
quoted
the
court
in
1966
quoted
in
lee
versus
macon
as
it
is.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
mr.
justice
marshall,
we
are
working
diligently
at
that
now.
we
don't
state
to
the
court
that
the
ultimate
objective
has
been
reached
when
i
would
say
that
measuring
and
looking
at
we
think
substantial
progress
and
i
will
get
to
its
figures
on
a
minute
but
i
think
certainly
in
the
foreseeable
future,
it's
hard
to
give
the
court
time.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
should
hope
not
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
should
hope
not
and
i
don't
think
that
it
will,
no
sir.
i
think
that
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
true.
it's
been
--
since
1954,
since
brown
versus
board
of
education
but
since
1964
when
montgomery
county
became
under
a
desegregation
program,
i
think
tremendous
tries
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
that's
correct
sir.
and
we
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
we
can't
argue
with
the
fact
that
we
had
to
do
desegregation
in
montgomery
county
prior
to
that.
we
have
to
say
that
but
we
have
to
say
that
but
we've
stated
this
court
that
we
are
going
about
changing
the
school
system
and
we
recognize
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
believe
that
these
petitioners
mr.
justice
marshall
must
(inaudible)
has
probably
already
graduated
from
school
so
it
couldn't
--
it
did
in
good,
yes
sir.
i
believe
that
it
gave
to
all
(inaudible)
or
time
in
public
school
systems
in
montgomery
or
desegregated
education.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
on
the
basis
of
making
assignments
in
the
future
years
as
we've
done
between
1967
and
today.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
i
believe,
in
the
record,
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
we
asked
judge
johnson
sir
to
stay
his
order
pending
appeal.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
in
essence,
yes
sir
because
he
gave
us
some
more
time
in
fact
in
substitute
teachers
and
that
was
--
it's
not
formally
by
a
motion,
no
sir,
but
informal
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
we
are
asking
this
court
mr.
justice
marshall
for
more
than
more
time.
we
are
asking
to
be
able
to
assign
our
faculty
and
stay
according
to
the
qualification
of
the
individual
as
well
as
to
remove
the
identifiability
of
the
school.
that's
what
we're
asking
this
court.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
in
answer
to
the
justice's
prior
question,
it
would
accomplished
before
the
children
that
the
justice
mentioned
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
that's
right,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
in
representing
the
board,
i
have
to
talk
to
the
educators
on
that
question
and
i'm
told
that
professional
educator
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
sir?
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
as
far
percentages
are
concerned,
it's
often
difficult
from
what
standpoint
or
quality
education
to
answer
that.
we
think
that
the
test
is
when
a
parent
or
a
child
looks
at
a
school,
is
that
school
identified
as
being
either
for
black
or
white?
we
think
mr.
justice
marshall
that
quality
placement
is
more
important
than
numerical
placement.
for
example,
if
we
put
a
black
teacher
or
white
teacher
that's
well
qualified
for
the
job,
in
a
particular
school
and
if
that
teacher
is
in
fact
qualified,
that
teacher,
the
black
or
all
white
teacher
in
the
black
or
white
school
in
a
desegregated
assignment
will
become
looked
upon
as
a
teacher,
as
a
quality
educator
and
not
as
either
black
or
white.
that's
true
we
think
on
identifiability
in
schools
and
we
can
get
that
if
the
court
please
by
quality,
whereas,
if
we
assign
unqualified
teachers
either
black
or
white
in
desegregated
assignments,
they
will
remain
black
or
white
forever.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
that's
true
justice
marshall
but
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
that's
true.
they
are
qualified
to
teach
in
the
subjects
that
they
have
trained
to
be
teachers.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
high
school
science
teacher
mr.
marshall
--
justice
marshall
is
certainly
not
qualified
to
teach
an
elementary
child
how
to
read.
and
if
we
get
into
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
right.
if
we
had
to
meet
a
racial
quota
of
60-40
in
the
elementary
grades,
we
would
have
to
take
some
of
the
teachers
from
the
elementary
grades
and
move
them
elsewhere
in
order
to
get
that
quota,
i'll
bring
them
in
to
the
elementary
junior
high
grades
from
some
other
face
of
our
system.
here's
what
the
60-40
overall
doesn't
consider.
we've
got
different
ratios
of
white
to
blacks
in
high
schools
than
we're
doing
in
junior
high,
different
ratio
to
white
to
black
in
junior
high
as
in
grammar
school.
now,
if
we
have
to
make
a
racial
quota,
we
would
have
to
come
along
and
take
them
out
of
elementary,
put
them
into
high
school
throughout
the
high
school
and
put
them
in
the
elementary.
now,
we
have
specific
examples
and
that
appears
from
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
that
would
be
a
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
the
government
and
the
plaintiffs,
if
the
court
please,
have
asked
for
a
random
redistribution.
now,
random
redistribution
to
accomplish
a
60-40
overall
ratio
would
have
to
be
in
each
particular
high
school
level,
junior
high
school
level,
elementary
level.
they
asked
for
a
random
redistribution
and
it
just
cannot
from
the
administrative
standpoint
were.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
alright
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
let
me
say
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
right
now
for
example,
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i'm
saying,
we've
got
different
quotas
or
different
actual
percentages
in
our
various
schools.
for
example
in
junior
high
school,
it
might
well
be
that
we've
got
70-30
instead
of
60-40.
if
we
had
to
come
along
and
we
would
have
more
of
one
then
we'd
be
able
to
use
in
the
60-40
and
we'd
have
to
have
something
to
do
with
those
teachers.
we'd
either
have
to
move
them
up
to
high
school
and
that
would
create
positions
that
would
have
to
be
found
for
teachers
in
other
areas.
it
would
just
create
mass
confusion.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
i
think
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
exhibit
to
our
brief,
we
are
meeting
a
one
to
five,
approximately
a
substantial
one
to
five.
we
got
more
latitude
of
course
if
the
court
please
and
we
would
have
a
three
to
two
overall.
and
i
think
this
is
significant
to
bring
out
at
this
point.
this
racial
ration
requirement
was
not
asked
for
in
the
plaintiffs
or
the
government's
motions
before
judge
johnson.
the
first
time
it
came
up
was
in
the
suggested
decree
prepared
by
the
governor.
therefore,
the
district
court
had
no
opportunity
to
look
into
these.
we
say
impossible
affix
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
mr.
justice
fortas,
i
believe
we
would
have
to
be
further
in
order
for
the
record
to
show
that
someone
would
have
to
be
familiar
with
the
individual
schools.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
don't
believe
sir
that
it
doesn't.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes
sir.
i'm
saying
that
that
is
the
case
and
is
going
to
be
the
case
in
varying
degrees
from
year
to
year.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
sir.
i
believe
that
it
is
for
this
reason.
certainly,
it
will
appear
from
the
record
and
from
the
reports
that
have
been
filed
over
the
years
that
varying
numbers
of
students
will
attend
varying
schools
each
year.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well
no
sir.
i
can't
state
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
can't
state
to
the
court
that
it's
specifically
in
the
printed
record
because
we
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
we
are
going
to
be
faced
with
this
racial
requirement
and
it
was
not
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
when
neither
the
plaintiffs
nor
the
government's
motion
for
further
relief
and
the
first
time,
we
were
faced
with
a
racial
ratio
was
in
the
suggested
order
as
prepared
by
the
government.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
if
it
was
just
those
two
mr.
justice
warren
involved
here
but
if
you
got
a
racial
requirement
that
you're
having
to
meet,
you
got
to
have
60-40
in
your
black
school,
60%
white
and
40%
black.
you
are
going
to
have
to
move
more
than
just
those
two
teachers
and
it's
going
to
get
into
a
process
of
musical
chairs
of
just
shifting
teachers
around
in
corners
of
bodies
and
yet
it
cannot.
this
is
to
be
the
best
thing
for
quality
education.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes
sir
and
that's
something
that
the
government
and
the
plaintiff
stated
differently
in
their
petition
for
certiorari
than
it
did
in
their
briefs
on
the
merits.
judge
johnson's
order
says
that
you've
got
to
have
in
each
school
the
same
ratio
of
blacks
to
white
as
the
overall
faculty
composition
demand
and
that
was
not
presented.
it
was
presented
as
mr.
chief
justice
says
in
petition
for
certiorari
within
the
briefs,
they
did
say
what
judge
johnson
ordered
and
it
was
in
each
schools.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
composed
from
mathematical
ratios
are
certainly
an
innovation
in
public
education.
we
think
this
is
a
very
far
reaching
decree
in
effect
and
we
think
that
certainly,
a
great
deal
of
thoughts
should
go
into
it
and
i
think
that
we
should
have
the
opportunity
to
present
to
the
district
court
the
effects
of
the
various
and
i've
outlined
some
of
my
line
some
more
the
effects
of
this
arbitrary,
we
say,
preconceived
mathematical
ratios.
we
say
they
are
unwise,
arbitrary
and
educationally
unsound.
in
hobson
versus
hansen
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
i
think
and
i
will
get
to
the
progress
that
we
made
in
fact
of
the
desegregation
if
the
court
please.
in
one
year,
the
montgomery
county
board
of
education,
in
1966-67
was
the
first
year
that
pursuant
to
court
order,
we
went
in
to
faculty
desegregation.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
alright.
well,
i
think
in
any
that
whether
is
1954,
mr.
justice,
or
whether
it's
1964,
we
have
212
full
time
faculty
members
teaching
in
minority
assignments
today,
111
blacks
and
34
white
schools
in
a
101
whites
and
39
black
school,
approximately
in
a
one
to
five
ratio
and
we
state
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
that
mr.
justice
is
right.
i
think
what
we
was
tried
before
is
regardless
of
whether
it
be
a
formally
or
predominantly
black
or
white
school.
we
are
striving
for
having
the
faculty
in
each
school
regardless
of
racial
or
non-racial
composition
as
not
being
identified.
i
agree
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
don't
believe
so.
we
would
have
to
take
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
mr.
justice
white,
i
can't
say
it
specifically
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
not
mr.
justice
white
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
this
is
an
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
if
--
this
is
an
example
of
an
area
that
the
district
court
had
no
opportunity
to
get
into
because
neither
the
plaintiffs
nor
the
government
asked
for
a
racial
ratio
ahead
of
this
hearing
and
we
had
no
opportunity
to
present
these
factors
to
the
court.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
that's
right
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
we
had
no
idea
that
a
ratio,
a
faculty
ratio
quota
was
going
to
come
out
of
this.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
as
i
see
it
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall's
question,
we
did
not
formally,
no
sir.
we
discussed
it
with
the
court
and
we
filed
a
petition
to
stay
pending
appeal
to
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes
sir.
we
filed
after
we
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
of
course,
this
is
an
example
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
after
we
had
an
informal
discussion
and
pointed
out
the
problems
that
was
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
we
didn't
pointed
out
in
the
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
in
detail
that
we're
pointing
it
out
to
this
court.
we
just
didn't
have
the
opportunity
and
the
time
to
study
with
our
people.
we
had
an
order
that
it
was
just
in
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
if
we
think
that's
a
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
we
think
that
mathematical
ratios
are
dangerous
in
public
education
and
that
is
one
of
the
examples.
and
one
of
the
reasons
we
say
we
had
no
opportunity
to
go
into
this
another
problem
that
we
have
in
racial
ratios
and
in
fact
the
assignment
no
one
the
school
board
nor
the
court
can
control
a
teacher
or
an
employment,
his
or
her
employment.
teachers
could
resign,
go
to
another
school
system
or
go
into
another
means
of
employment.
so
here
we've
got
a
standard
on
the
employment
of
faculties,
this
gives
to
something
that
the
school
board
nor
the
court
has
anything
to
do
with.
a
teacher
can
resign
if
she
wants
to.
she
can
go
into
another
field
of
endeavor,
he
or
she
can.
unfortunately
in
the
state
of
alabama,
we
don't
have
the
financial
resources
to
hold
a
lot
(inaudible)
money.
we
have
to
treat
them
as
professional
people,
so
we
think
another
drawback
on
a
racial
ratio
requirement
is
that
you
are
tying
the
standard
to
something
that
neither
the
courts
nor
the
school
board
can
control.
another
point
that
we
bring
out
and
we
say
shows
the
lack
of
wisdom
in
such
a
proposal,
if
your
state,
if
it's
tied
to
the
composition
in
the
entire
faculty,
it
would
inevitably
fair
from
one
school
district
to
another.
for
example,
in
birmingham,
alabama,
there
are
25-26%
black
and
74%
white.
in
oklahoma
city,
there
are
14%
black,
86%
white.
washington
d.c.,
78%
black
and
12%
white.
you
got
a
yardstick
that
varies
from
state
to
state
from
district
to
district
and
even
within
the
various
school
districts
within
a
given
state
and
was
pointed
out
a
minute
ago,
it
varies
between
your
junior
high
school
and
elementary
levels
even
within
the
same
school
district.
and
it
varies
from
year
to
year.
and
we
think
that
your
state
is
a
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir
and
that's
hopefully
what
all
of
the
schools
are
headed
for.
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out
though
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
we
feel
that
it
is
more
than
that
on
the
current
statistics.
all
current
statistics
are
i
think
we
see
it
and
we
got
212
full
time
classroom
faculty
teachers
and
now
the
superintendent
in
his
testimony
before
this
order
said
that
he
was
going
to
have
an
excess
of
a
hundred
and
he
has
worked
diligently
and
in
his
statement
on
of
this
court
that
he's
going
to
continue
to
do
it
without
the
imposition
or
mathematical
ratio
that
certainly
cannot
be
beneficial
to
quality
education
when
you
assign
teachers
as
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
and
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes
sir
and
the
fifth
circuit
made
that
clear
that
the
majority
opinion
emphatically
said
that
you
had
to
compulsory
assign
but
we
say
alright.
but
in
this
compulsory
assignment,
let's
take
the
qualification,
the
individuality
of
a
teacher
into
consideration
if
you
lose
that,
if
the
court
please,
in
public
education
is
going
to
be
at
the
expense
of
school
children
throughout
the
nation
regardless
of
race.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
don't
think
there
is
but
i
think
when
you
have
to
assign
a
teacher
on
the
basis
of
meeting
a
quota
instead
of
assigning
a
teacher
on
the
basis
of
qualification
and
after
careful
consideration
of
what
she
was
teaching.
for
example,
a
science
teacher
for
a
science
teacher,
that
sounds
alright
but
if
this
science
teacher
had
been
teaching
physics
at
one
school,
you
can't
send
over,
it
wouldn't
be
right
to
send
him
over
and
teach
biology
in
another
--
or
the
other
side
or
if
a
teacher
had
been
teaching
general
science
in
a
white
school,
it
certainly
wouldn't
be
fair
to
the
teacher
nor
to
the
child
to
send
it
to
a
black
school
to
teach
physics
and
those
are
all
elements
that
they've
got
to
come
in
to
faculty
placement.
so
i
say
yes
to
the
judge,
we
don't
make
a
distinction
between
a
white
and
a
black
teacher
on
the
basis
of
qualification
but
what
the
teacher
is
trained
to
do.
if
it's
a
science
teacher
and
a
science
teacher
change
from
one
school
to
another
would
meet
a
quota
but
if
that
science
teacher
had
been
teaching
general
science
in
white
school,
it
wouldn't
be
fair
to
the
teacher
nor
to
the
children
to
teach
physics
into
other
school.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
not
as
much
narrow
as
it
has
been.
i
can't
say
that
all
the
best
teachers
have
gone
but
they
are
leaving
certainly,
that's
true
to
some
extent.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes
sir,
that's
true.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
it
would
be
your
honor
unrealistic
not
to
say
that
would
be
true.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
would
say
substantially
so,
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
alright
sir,
yes.
in
answer
to
mr.
justice
warren's
question,
if
those
were
the
only
two,
as
i
said,
the
only
two
teachers
that
you
can
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
alright
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
what
about
this
sir
if
the
a
teacher
at
one
school
that
it
shows
him
to
take
physics
and
not
(inaudible)
then
the
general
science
teacher
would
be
in
the
position
of
teaching
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
as
far
as
one
teacher
is
concerned,
there
wouldn't
be
but
if
we
got
a
three
to
two
ratio
overall
and
we've
got
to
make
it
in
the
high
school,
elementary
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
i'll
say
this
to
the
court
that
mathematical
ratios
are
inherently
problematic
in
public
education
and
i've
tried
to
point
out
some
of
them
and
there
are
many,
many
more
and
i
think
judge
skelly
wright
in
hobson
versus
hansen
recognized
it
when
after
discussing
dowell
and
kier
and
other
cases
cited.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
it
is
mr.
justice
marshall
in
so
far
as
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
after
discussing
dowell
and
kier,
justice
wright
said
this.
justice
wright
--
judge
wright
said
there
will
be
an
abundance
of
opportunity
later
for
advisory
argument
on
the
merits
and
demerits
of
the
ends
and
means
concerning
teacher
and
of
race.
he
said
that
in
hobson
versus
hansen
after
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
that
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
i
think
in
the
school
system
in
montgomery
county,
alabama,
we
are
striving
to
cope
with
the
problem
and
to
solve
it
and
we
state
to
the
court
that
we
will
solve
it.
we
will
solve
it
in
student
desegregation
and
we'll
solve
it
in
fact
that
desegregation
without
the
imposition
of
these
compulsory
mathematical
ratios.
the
government
in
brief
and
in
argument
have
said
that
this
is
only
--
that
the
mathematical
ratio
requirement
is
remedial
and
not
for
perpetuity.
i
suppose
that
they
are
seeking
to
make
the
distinction
between
a
de
facto
and
a
de
jure
public
school
system
but
when
it
comes
to
teachers,
i
failed
to
see
the
distinction
between
de
facto
and
de
jure
or
certainly
it
makes
no
difference
as
far
as
the
neighborhood
or
fortuitous
housing
patterns
as
to
what
teachers
are
assigned
to
what
schools
and
i
think
that
even
more
in
a
de
facto
situation,
what
we
call,
what's
been
called
de
facto
faculty
integration
is
more
important.
we
can't
see
either
teachers
there,
they
are
not,
if
they
are
not,
they
have
the
school
as
identifiable
as
patterned
for
one
particular
race
or
another,
we
think
that
the
problem
exists
whether
you
call
it
de
facto
or
whether
you
call
it
de
jure,
the
teachers
are
either
there.
it's
either
identifiable
as
white
or
identifiable
as
black.
if
they
say
it's
not
for
perpetuity
if
a
charge
of
racial
imbalance
is
made,
continued
to
be
made,
if
the
charges
of
racial
identifiability
is
made,
the
perpetuity
of
the
racial
ratio
requirement
would
exist
just
as
long
as
these
charges
are
made.
and
we
say
that
we
are
going
about
in
montgomery,
alabama
to
provide
non-racially
identified
faculties
in
each
schools
and
we
say
that
it's
unwise,
educationally
unsound
and
not
consistent
with
quality
education
to
have
a
mathematical
ratio
and
i've
tried
to
explain.
but
if
we're
doing
it
and
if
we're
getting
the
job
done
as
the
district
court
noted
in
the
opinion
that's
been
quoted
from,
judge
johnson
said
that
you
are
doing
as
much
without
the
racial
requirement
or
as
what
you
tell
us
you
do
is
the
court
requiring
you
to
do
anyway
at
record
page
562.
what's
exactly
required
in
the
court
order
is
very
little
that
it's
any
more
than
the
school
board
by
his
testimony
and
by
the
school
that
we're
going
to
do
anyway.
but
we
planned
to
assign
faculty
and
staff,
so
the
schools
are
not
identifiable
racially
and
also
to
carefully
consider
the
quality
placement.
teaching
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
is
uniformly
recognized
as
an
art
and
least
are
professional
people.
the
individuality
in
imparting
knowledge
from
one
to
another
is
an
intensely
personal
endeavor
and
it's
just
not
can't
possibly
be
in
the
best
interest
of
public
education
for
blacks
or
whites,
to
assign
these
people
according
to
color,
to
assign
professional
teachers
according
to
their
bodies
and
not
as
to
individuality.
now,
we
recognize
that
we
must
foremost
in
our
minds
keep
the
consideration
of
desegregating
the
faculties
and
we
state
to
the
court
that
we
are
but
we
ask
for
the
opportunity
to
desegregate
our
faculties
and
do
it
consistently
with
quality
education.
and
as
the
solicitor
general
commented
candidly
so
i
thought,
the
montgomery
county
board
has
made
significant
progress.
we
got
significant
progress
we
say
in
faculty
desegregation
and
in
students
and
we
state
to
the
courts
that
we're
going
to
continue
but
we
ask
for
the
opportunity
to
continue
with
our
constitutional
requirements
to
desegregate
and
at
the
same
time,
let
us
consider
this
vital,
the
critical
element
of
the
individuality
in
faculty
assignment.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
did
if
the
court
please,
before
the
court
of
appeals
but
again,
i
didn't
have
an
opportunity
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes
sir
and
i
argued
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
it
is
in
the
context
mr.
justice
of
what
we're
arguing
at
the
footnote
on
the
record
at
page
757,
the
court
of
appeals
says
this,
“although
appellants
consistently
argued
a
voluntary
assignment
of
teachers
and
staff
and
contend
that
sound
and
quality
school
administration
favored
voluntary
assignment,
the
following
statement
has
found
from
the
brief
of
appellant.”
and
we
stated
this
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
court
below.
these
appellants
fully
recognized
that
they
have
the
affirmative
duty
to
desegregate
the
faculty
throughout
the
system
to
the
end
of
the
pattern
of
teacher
assignment
to
any
particular
school
shall
not
be
identifiable
as
tailored
for
a
heavy
concentration
of
either
negro
or
white
pupils
in
the
schools.
the
appellant
further
recognized
that
they
have
a
legal
right
to
compel
faculty
assignment
if
voluntary
placement
is
not
effective
and
we
ask
therefore
an
opportunity
to
volunteer
the
placement
and
of
course
that's
if
it
can't
be
done.
if
you
can
have
a
teacher
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no
sir.
the
court
of
appeals
said
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no
sir
and
the
court
of
appeals
emphatically
said
that
we
must
assign
teachers
and
what
we
will
continue
to
do
though
we'll
continue
to
have
them
volunteer
if
we
can
do
it
inconsistently
without
mandate
of
complete
faculty
desegregation.
if
we
can't
then
we're
going
to
assign
but
we're
going
to
try
to
have
volunteers.
if
we
can't
get
the
job
done
that
way,
we'll
move
in
to
assignment.
of
course,
every
teacher
that
comes
into
the
certain
system
now
is
told
and
no
one
in
certain
terms
did
she
cannot
come
to
work
without
the
clear
understanding
that
she
can
be
assigned
to
any
school
in
the
system
whether
it
be
formally
white
or
black
school.
we
think
that
the
progress
that
we
made
in
the
area
of
segregation
in
montgomery
county
leans
credence
to
our
statements
to
the
court
of
our
good
intent.
the
district
court
on
five
occasions
has
pointed
out
in
the
court
of
appeals
order
complemented
the
montgomery
county
board
of
education
on
its
efforts
in
desegregation.
in
september
1967,
the
hearing
that
was
the
start
of
the
very
hearing
that
is
before
the
court
now.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
they
were
placed
if
the
court
please
to
the
best
of
our
ability
in
accord
with
quality
criteria.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no
sir,
i
certainly
do
not.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no
sir,
as
i
say
it
to
the
court,
--
as
i
say
it
to
court
early,
i
believe
that
if
we
are
allowed
to
make
these
assignments
based
on
individual
quality,
based
on
individual
consideration,
it
wouldn't
be
long
before
that
teacher
is
looked
upon
as
not
black
or
not
white
but
it
looked
upon
and
respected
as
a
professional
educator
and
that
might
--
so
i
might
say
that's
optimistic
but
i
think
it
already
happened
in
the
black
athlete
that's
going
to
the
university
of
alabama
in
a
grant
scholarship.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
if
the
court
please
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
would
say
that
it's
certainly
that's
part
of
it.
i
think
the
overall
--
i've
tried
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
because
the
judge
as
i
said
overall
and
i
tried
to
point
out
specifics.
in
the
area
of
faculty
placement,
if
teachers
are
assigned
according
to
quotas,
according
to
percentages,
it's
just
inevitably
is
going
to
lose
sight
of
the
critical
individuality
in
teachers
and
i
gave
the
examples
that
i've
given
a
while
ago
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
i've
tried
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i'm
not
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
mr.
justice
white's
question.
i'd
say
this.
we
want
to
be
able
to
consider
the
individual
quality.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
in
that
particular
white
school
or
black
school.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
don't
believe
that
the
racial
consideration
is
controlling.
i
think
the
ability
of
the
teacher
regardless
of
race,
the
training
of
the
teacher
regardless
of
race,
the
teaching
certificate
of
the
teacher
regardless
of
race,
what
the
teacher
had
been
teaching
for
the
last
ten
years
regardless
of
race,
those
were
the
things
we
want
to
consider
and
we
stated
in
all
sincerity,
if
we
have
a
ratio
and
they
say,
“well,
it
is
not
for
perpetuity.
it's
only
remedial
and
the
judge
didn't
mean
for
you
to
do
it
all
it
want.”
we
say
that
let
us
try
to
get
the
non-identifiability
corrected,
get
the
problem
solved
before
such
as
this.
we
say
it's
never
going
to
be
the
same
but
let
us
--
we
state
that
we're
going
to
do
it,
we're
in
the
process
of
doing
it,
the
objective
we
see,
we're
accomplishing
it.
we
say
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes.
quite
extensively
at
the
outset.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
would
think
so
particularly
in
the
summer
of
1967
and
not
as
much
in
the
summer
of
1968.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
well,
not
as
whether
we
would
like
to.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
we've
been
able
to
get
them
to
the
standpoint
that
we
will
accomplish
what
we
have
here
but
if
they
wouldn't
for
resignations,
if
there
wasn't
for
just
saying
i
won't
teach
in
your
system,
i'll
go
to
birmingham
where
there's
not
that
much,
so
i'll
go
to
mountain
brook,
alabama
where
there's
none.
or
if
it
hadn't
been
to
that,
we'd
have
a
substantial
mode,
if
it
wasn't
for
resignations
or
refusal
to
take,
we
would
have
it.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
more
resignations,
yes.
i
think
we
saw
some
after
the
district
court
order.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
think
now,
mr.
justice
warren,
the
record
shows
that
there's
probably
a
little
less
than
10%
faculty
turnover
a
year
and
that
would
be
new
ones
coming
in
and
i
think
the
surge
of
students
firing
the
old
ones
is
not
the
problem
that
it
was
some
years
ago.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
they're
teaching
the
same
thing.
yes.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
would
say
in
answer
to
that
yes.
and
one
other
objection,
i'd
like
to
say
as
far
as
we
say
that
the
mathematical
ratio
requirement
is
unwarranted
because
of
our
progress,
because
of
the
district
court's
--
the
court
of
appeals'
specific
directives
that
faculty
desegregation
must
be
accomplished
without
delay
or
we
had
affirmatively
said
he
had
to
assign
a
voluntary
assignments,
it
didn't
work.
we
say
that
in
a
remedial
read
as
being
handed
down
by
the
court
of
appeals,
we
say
it's
unconstitutional
hereto
and
we
think
it
would
be
dangerous.
no
mathematical
ratio
has
been
required
that
we
know
about
that
would
require
juries
to
mirror
the
racial
composition
of
a
community.
no
court
has
said
that
we
know
about
that
government
agencies
have
to
hire
according
to
racial
ratio
or
that
the
school
chairman
would
have
to
be
assigned
according
to
racial
ratios
and
in
fact
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
specifically
says
that
they
shouldn't
be
assigned
to
eliminate
racial
imbalance
and
in
the
area
of
hiring
on
jury
system,
we
feel
like
it
that
it
points
out
the
lack
of
wisdom
and
the
inherent
dangerousness
that
we
have
here.
just
a
touch
to
another
minute
on
our
statistics,
in
addition
to
the
212
full
time
faculty
assignments
that
we
have,
that's
in
every
school
but
one
in
our
system
has
a
desegregated
faculty.
the
only
school
that
does
not
is
a
three
room
rural
school
down
in
pine
level,
alabama.
it
only
has
three
teachers
but
they've
had
black
substitute
teachers.

of

teaching

in
seven
black

and
24

there
are

in

in
substitute

substitute
teachers
according
to
the
report
that
we
filed
on
these,
some
of
the
15
in
1968
and
according
to
a
letter
that
we
received
from
the
district
court,
though
reports

up

701

excuse
me.
two
schools
in
our
system
didn't
have
any
substitute
teachers
between
september
15
and
all
substitute
teachers
are
dated
from
september
15
to
december
15.
substitute
teachers
present
a
terrific
problem
and
that
the
teacher
will
call
7:30
or
8
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
say
i'm
sick
and
the
principal
has
to
get
on
the
phone
and
find
somebody
and
get
them
out
there.
it's
a
burden
and
we
think
the
progress
that
we
made
there
are
substantial.
(inaudible)
is
training
programs
throughout
the
system
had
been
desegregated
and
we
think
that
that's
really
an
important.
here,
our
teachers
of
both
races
who
are
experts
in
the
field
were
teachers
or
desegregated
faculty
audience
in
both
white
and
black
schools
and
we
think
that
that
certainly
lay
in
good
ground
where
toward
the
continued
progress
that
we
stated
to
the
court
that
we're
going
to
make
and
they
do
that
in
a
meeting
in
a
white
school
one
time
and
in
a
black
school
the
next.
teachers
are
assigned
to
other
schools
for
observation
of
classes,
to
see
a
more
experienced
math
teacher
to
teach
that
class
and
that's
not
completely
on
an
integrated
basis.
we
think
that
again
is
important.
administrative
councils
have
been
completely
desegregated.
faculty
meetings
have
been
completely
desegregated.
administrative
councils
went
over
the
school.
administrative
staffs
meet
one
week
in
a
black
school
and
the
next
week
in
a
white
school.
we
state
to
the
court
that
the
progress
that
we
made
and
has
been
noted
by
the
district
court
and
it
wasn't
that
an
empty
phrase
when
judge
frank
m.
johnson
told
the
school
board
in
1967
i
believe
and
1966
that
complemented
the
board
by
operating
a
school
system
as
professional
educators
and
not
as
politicians.
i
think
that's
significant.
it's
significant
like
i
started
to
say
a
moment
ago.
in
september
of
1967,
four
months
before
the
order
that
we
had
in
court
about,
judge
johnson
stated
that
it
complemented
the
board
again
as
pointed
out
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
saved
this
from
the
bench
on
september
5,
1967.
they're
dealing
here
with
the
school
system
that
you
haven't
had
to
take
the
appellate
court
a
single
time
since
you
started.
it's
the
only
system
in
the
state
that
you
haven't
had
to
do
at
all.
they
have
done
what
they
have
done
in
good
faith
and
they
have
done
ahead
than
most
of
your
other
systems
in
every
field.
we
think
that
that
again
is
evidence
of
our
progress
in
substantial
ways
what
we
say
we're
going
to
do
and
additionally
when
judge
johnson
said
and
complemented
the
board
and
said
that
he
would
recommend
other
school
systems
to
emulate
the
conduct
of
the
montgomery
county
board,
that's
not
an
empty
phrase.
we
say
to
the
court
that
we
made
progress.
the
remedial
writ
had
been
handed
down
by
the
court
of
appeals.
we
say
that
we
recognize
and
we
are
the
first
to
recognize
that
the
ultimate
objectives
have
been
reached.
we
say
we're
working
on
it.
we're
on
the
process
of
accomplishing
it.
we
say
that
we
will
reach
them
for
the
purposes
of
desegregating
our
school
system
and
compliance
with
the
green
case,
with
bradley
case,
with
rogers
versus
paul
but
also
consistently
with
quality
education
for
the
best
interest
of
white
children
and
black
children
alike.
we
think
that
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
the
particular
objection
judge
is
that
we
have
to
have
a
ratio
in
faculty
assignment
and
we
say
when
teachers
are
assigned
to
meet
a
ratio
instead
of
to
meet
quality
education
and
instead
to
remedy
identifiableness
of
the
schools
that
you
lose
quality
education
for
whites
and
blacks
alike.
we
say
that
racial
quotas
are
inherently
dangerous
in
public
education,
that
they
are
tied
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
no,
sir.
we're
moving
toward
this.
we
are
moving
toward
the
faculty
in
each
school
being
not
identifiable
as
either
white
or
colored
for
the
students
to
go
into
that
school.
when
a
child
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
we
can
do
that
judge
the
same
way
that
we've
done
in
the
last
year
by
assigning
blacks
to
white
schools
consistently
with
quality
education
and
white
students,
blacks
to
whites
and
whites
black,
not
to
meet
the
quota
but
to
remove
the
identifiableness
of
either
a
black
or
white
school
in
so
far
as
the
children
are
concerned.
and
i
tried
to
go
into
the
specific
reasons
that
we
say
specifically
that
the
invocation
of
a
compulsory
ratio
on
top
of
what
we
say
we're
going
to
do
is
unwarranted,
it's
unnecessary,
it's
unconstitutional
and
it
puts
an
unwise
detrimental
burden
on
quality
education
and
we
think
--
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
probably
the
jefferson
davis
high
school.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
it's
situated
on
carter
hill
road
in
montgomery,
alabama.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
another
school,
mr.
robinson
just
called
my
attention
to
was
the
harrison
school
on
the
southern
(inaudible)
in
montgomery.
harrison
school
--
let's
see
--
the
3
black
teachers
and
15
white.
the
jefferson
davis
school,
7
black
and
29
white.
generally,
on
the
basis,
those
are
two
examples.
and
to
some
it
may
be
more
but
generally
one
out
of
five
throughout
the
system
are
teaching
a
whole
class,
so
in
our
schools
where
--
if
it
is
a
predominantly
white
student
population,
approximately
one
out
of
five
of
the
teachers
in
that
school
are
black
teachers.
does
that
answer
the
judge's
question?
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i'm
just
an
attorney
sir.
but
i
do
state
that
we've
discussed
this
with
our
board
and
the
statements
and
assurances
that
i
make
to
this
court
are
from
the
board
of
education
of
montgomery
county,
the
same
people
that
judge
johnson
said
were
running
the
school
system
as
professional
educators
and
not
as
politicians.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
it's
been
favorable.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
yes,
i
think
they
tend
to
communicate
well
and
i
think
a
reason
justice
black
that
it
has
been
favorable
is
that
we
made
these
assignments
based
on
considerations
of
what
the
teacher
had
been
teaching
and
what
she
was
assigned
to
and
she's
qualified
for
what
she's
doing
and
those
white
children
are
going
to
look
at
that
black
teacher
not
as
a
black
or
white
but
as
a
good
teacher
and
likely
they
will
respect
her
as
a
good
teacher.
and
i
think
that's
what
we
would
like
to
accomplish.
mr.
joseph
d.
phelps
i
do
so.
i
think
we're
going
to
move
further.
