mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
somewhat
of
an
advantage
over
mr.
wallace
and
that
i
was
at
all
of
the
proceedings
including
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
might
just
say
for
openers
that
when
mr.
matlock
or
somebody
because
we
don't
know
who
yet
that
legibly
robbed
the
bank
of
wyocena,
they
did
get
all
of
their
money.
i
think
the
government
is
wrong
in
many
respects
and
i
must
start
by
saying
that
we
do
have
in
this
case
a
test
of
judge
doyle,
namely,
it's
a
two-pronged
test--a
test
of
apparent
authority
as
well
as
the
magic
words
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
and
that
judge
doyle
used,
namely
actual
authority
to
search.
now,
the
government
leaves
out
a
couple
of
very,
very
important
things.
and
the
first
question,
and
that
question
was
asked
in
the
court
of
appeals,
why
no
search
warrant?
that's
the
most
important
thing
that
i
can
think
of.
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
officers
admitted
they
were
in
no
danger.
all
of
the
testimony
from
every
officer
i
specifically
asked,
were
you
in
danger
of
your
life?
no.
where
was
the
defendant
at
this
time?
he
was
handcuffed
in
the
car,
in
front
of
the
property.
now,
the
facts
in
regard
of
that,
i
believe
are
important.
the
defendant
was
arrested
outside
of
the
house.
he
either
went
out
to
walk
the
dogs
but
anyway,
he
was
outside
when
the
columbia
county
sheriff's
department
came
upon
him.
they
put
him
in
the
car.
they
admitted
at
that
time
that
they
had
no
knowledge
that
any
fruits
of
any
alleged
crime
were
in
the
house.
they
never
asked
the
defendant
his
permission
to
search
the
house.
they
never
asked
him
if
he
was
a
tenant
in
the
house.
they
never
asked
him
whether
or
not
he
paid
rent.
all
they
did
was
put
him
in
the
car
and
knocked
on
the
door.
now,
there's
a
conflict
in
testimony
as
to
whether
or
not
they
did
in
fact
knocked
on
the
door
or
whether
or
not
they
in
affect
burst
in.
the
court,
both
the
lower
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
find
that
gayle
graff,
the
paramour,
the
mistress
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
her,
in
fact,
gave
consent
to
the
police
officers
coming
in.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
well,
it
is
hard
to
tell
what
she
knows.
she
knew
she
wasn't
the
wife.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
not
then,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
some
other
time.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
she
said,
she
was
his
common
law
wife.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
not
in
wisconsin
your
honor.
at
some
southern
jurisdictions
and
other
jurisdictions,
it
might
well
be.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
you
know
that
better
than
i
do,
your
honor.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
earlier
that
day.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
this
was
the
morning,
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
hardly
got
a
chance
to
say
anything
yesterday
except
good
afternoon.
i
would
briefly
like
to
reiterate
the
facts
as
set
forth
by
the
government
because
i
think
they're
important
in
this
case
especially
in
light
of
robinson
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
just
gave
his
opinion.
the
important
things
in
this
case
are
that
mr.
matlock
was
arrested
in
the
yard
outside
of
the
house.
he
was
placed
in
the
police
car.
the
officers
all
admitted
that
they
were
in
no
danger.
the
house
was
under
siege.
it
was
surrounded.
they
had
no
knowledge
that
any
fruits
of
any
crime
were
in
the
house.
no
questions
were
asked
as
the
defendant’s
relationship
as
an
owner,
as
a
tenant,
as
a
husband,
or
anything
else
in
relation
to
the
marshall
residence.
the
officers,
even
though
they
had
mr.
matlock
completely
under
control
in
the
car,
never
asked
his
permission
to
search
the
premises.
when
they
did
go
to
the
door,
of
course
they
did
not
have
that
very
important
thing
and
that
is
a
search
warrant.
they
never
asked
gail
graff
who
she
was.
the
officer’s
testimony
is
clear
that
when
they
came
in
the
door
she
was
standing
with
her
two-
or
three-year-old
baby.
they
never
asked
who
she
was,
whether
she
was
a
daughter,
a
wife,
or
anything
else.
they
asked
whether
or
not
they
could
search
the
house.
she
consented
to
the
search
of
the
house.
i
think
it
is
important
that
we
remember
in
this
case
that
it's
mr.
matlock’s
constitutional
rights
that
are
at
stake
here
and
not
gail
graff’s.
the
government
argues
that
there
was
a
joint
occupancy
of
that
bedroom.
now
--
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
yes,
sir?
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
pardeeville
is
about
15-20
miles
north
of
madison.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
very
small
town.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
no,
columbia
county.
madison
is
dane
county.
pardeeville
is
famous,
your
honor,
for
the
manufacture
of
athletic
score
boards.
they're
made
in
pardeeville,
wisconsin.
that's
their
claim
to
fame,
that
and
fishing,
i
think.
it's
in
columbia
county
and
this
search
was
conducted
by
the
columbia
county
sheriff’s
department
along
with,
at
the
second
and
third
search,
the
fbi.
and
even
in
the
second
and
third
searches,
which
aren't
material
to
this
case,
the
fbi
did
not
bother
to
get
a
search
warrant
either.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
one
of
the
deputies,
i
believe
his
name
was
cross,
later
testified
and
he
wasn't
there
during
the
first
search.
he
testified
that
he
knew
that
gail
graff
was
a
daughter
of
mr.
and
mrs.
marshall.
and
he
testified
that
even
though
he
didn't
know
the
relationship
of
bill
matlock
to
gail
graff,
that
at
one
time
when
he
was
visiting
the
house
he
saw
bill
matlock
come
down
from
the
upstairs.
but
that
testimony
isn't
important,
i
don't
believe,
because
he
wasn't
one
of
the
officers
who
were
involved
in
the
first
search
wherein
they
found
the
money.
now,
getting
back
to
this
joint
occupancy,
the
government
has
used
that
term
quite
often
and
i
don't
believe
it
is
in
the
record.
gail
graff
was
asked
whether
or
not
they
could
search
the
bedroom
and
she
said,
“yes,
you
may,
you
can
search
the
whole
house.”
and,
i
believe
the
testimony
is
that,
from
time
to
time,
she
slept
in
that
bedroom.
but
as
far
as
joint
occupancy
goes,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
they
jointly
occupied
the
bedroom
as
husband
and
wife
or
on
a
regular
basis.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
gail
graff
did
have
a
bedroom
of
her
own
on
the
first
floor
of
that
residence.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
no,
i
don't
because
that,
your
honor,
is
something
that
came
out
again
after
the
first
search
and
after
the
money
was
found
in
the
closet.
now
had
they
inquired
or
had
they
told,
and
that
is
an
issue
that
is
not
in
this
case
also,
had
they
told
gail
graff
“you
don't
have
to
consent.”
or
had
they
asked
her,
“are
you
the
wife?
do
you
have
joint
occupancy
of
the
bedroom?”
fine.
but
they
never
asked.
and
finally,
it
was
subsequent
to,
i
believe,
all
of
the
searches
that
she
or
--
i
guess
it
was
in
the
second
or
third
search
which
aren't
material
where
she
said,
“yes,
the
upper
two
drawers
are
mine
and
the
bottom
two
drawers
are
bill’s.”
now
in
that
regard,
your
honor,
i
think
the
inference
could
just
as
well
be
that
there
wasn't
room
in
the
house
to
store
all
clothes
and
people
were
using
everybody’s
closets.
i
think
that
the
testimony
was
very
clear
in
this
case
that
at
no
time
did
anybody
asked,
for
instance,
whose
dresses
were
hanging
up
in
the
closet.
they
could've
been
mrs.
marshall’s.
that
is
not
in
the
record
that
they
were
gail
graff’s.
the
district
court
judge
doyle
found
that
the
government
had
not
proved
by
the
greater
weight
of
the
credible
evidence
that
there
was
joint
occupancy
of
that
bedroom.
they
of
course,
also
found
that
there
was
no
evidence
except
this
“reliable
hearsay”
that
there
was
any
evidence
that
gail
graff
was
married
to
bill
matlock
or
that
she
had
authority
to
consent.
what
the
government
would
ask
this
court
to
do
at
this
time
is
to
say
that
apparent
authority
is
sufficient
and
you
don't
need
actual
authority.
now,
another
thing
that
i
believe
is
important
in
the
case
is
the
government
has
argued
before
this
court
yesterday
that
gail
graff
said
that,
“it's
my
room.”
now,
she
never
said
that
and
that
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
we
did.
we
showed
that
at
the
suppression
hearing,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
the
question
of
exclusivity
never
came
up.
i
believe,
on
my
examination
of
mr.
matlock
or
of
mrs.
marshall,
we
asked
the
questions
of,
“how
was
he
there?
what
was
he
doing?”
and
she
said
“he
is
a
paying
tenant.
he'd
paid
a
$100.00
a
month
and
he
was
current.”
and
the
judge,
judge
doyle,
made
a
finding
that
he
was
current
in
his
rent.
no
question
was
ever
asked
and
i
don't
think
it
was
inadvertent
or
on
purpose,
your
honor.
no
question
was
ever
asked
whether
or
not
gail
graff
also
was
a
paying
guest.
but
the
police
officers
never
asked
either.
it
was
myself
who
asked
on
direct
examination
of
mrs.
marshall
what
the
situation
was
as
far
as
rent
goes.
the
officers
never
inquired
at
any
time.
now
i
agree
with
the
law,
of
course
i
agree
with
it,
that
two
persons
who
have
equal
rights
may
give
legal
consent
and
that's
very
clear.
but
here,
your
honor,
and
that
was
my
next
point,
that
there
was
no
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
gail
graff
was
standing
in
the
position
of
the
defendant’s
wife,
whether
of
nor
she
also
was
paying
for
that
apart
--
for
that
bedroom,
or
whether
or
not
she
was
sleeping
any
place
else.
mr.
justice
marshall
yesterday,
raised
the
question
of
the
joint
use
of
the
diaper
bag.
and
there
again,
that's
a
question
that
was
never
raised
yesterday.
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
that
a
diaper
bag
in
this
situation,
the
very
strong
inference
is
that
it
was
used
for
diapers
for
gail
graff’s
two
or
three-year-old
son.
that
question
was
never
going
into
the
suppression
hearing.
the
main
question
in
this
case
and
the
only
real
question
is
whether
or
not
a
third
party
who
consents
is
in
fact,
or
“in
appearance,
a
joint
possessor.”
the
seventh
circuit
placed
upon
the
police
the
burden
of
determining
whether
a
person
encountered
at
the
door
has
the
authority
to
consent.
now
we
cited
numerous
cases,
and
the
government
has
also.
they
rely,
for
instance,
on
the
gorg
case.
now,
the
differentiation
in
that
case
is
that,
in
gorg,
the
police
acted
in
good
faith.
they
had
consent
and
they
had
the
request
of
the
homeowner
to
search
the
house.
the
only
question
in
that
case
was
the
right
of
the
person
who
occupied
the
room,
the
son
in
that
case.
if
you
remember,
marijuana
plants
were
found
in
the
room
after
the
son
was
arrested.
the
question
of
the
right
to
refuse
consent
was
not
present.
the
court
or
the
government
also
cites
schneckloth.
the
only
question
in
schneckloth
was
the
voluntariness
of
the
consent
to
search.
they
cite
hopper
and
in
that
case,
the
court
never
reached
the
question
of
actual
authority
because
it
ruled
that
the
consenter
did
not
even
have
apparent
authority
to
consent.
now,
yesterday,
the
question
was
asked,
mr.
wallace
of
whether
or
not
he
relied
upon
hill
and
i
would
say
today,
“yes,
he
does
rely
upon
hill”
and
he
also,
i
would
assume,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
he
now
would
rely
upon
robinson.
robinson
is
analogist
to
hill
in
one
thing
and
it's
differentiated
from
matlock
in
that,
in
hill,
the
search
was
incidental
to
an
arrest.
and
i
think
those
are
the
magic
words
that
take
matlock
out
of
the
hill
decision
and
out
of
the
robinson
decision.
this
search
was
not
in
any
manner,
shape,
or
form
incidental
to
any
arrest
of
william
matlock.
the
government
would
have
this
court
adapt
a
theory
that
ignorance
is
bliss.
we
cited
in
our
brief
at
pages
12
and
13
a
very
short
argument
in
that
regard
and
i
said,
"to
accept
the
government’s
apparent
authority
position
would
be
to
assume
that
ignorance
is
bliss.
and
when
it
comes
to
warrantless
police
searches,
the
less
the
officer
knows
and
the
less
he
takes
the
time
to
find
out
and
the
less
he
actually
finds
out,
the
better
off
his
search
becomes.
the
government
says
that
a
warrantless
search
is
reasonable
if
consented
to
by
one
who
may
appear
to
have
authority
to
consent
even
if,
in
fact,
he
does
not
have
that
authority.
now,
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
burger
came
up
with
the
thing
that
i
wish
i
had
thought
of
and
that's
mainly
the
meter
reader
being
in
the
house.
i
think
i
can
do
you
probably
one
better,
your
honor,
in
all
due
respect.
let's
take
the
weekend
guest.
let's
take
the
mother-in-law
who
comes
to
visit
and
everybody
is
out
of
the
house
except
mother-in-law,
and
up
in
the
bedroom
of
the
16-year-old
son,
he's
got
marijuana
and
heroin
and
lsd
and
all
the
other
good
things.
and
the
police
have
a
very
reliable
informant
who
says
there
are
these
things
in
the
boy’s
bedroom
and
they
walked
in
and
ring
the
door
bell
and
mother-in-law
opens
the
door
and
they
said,
“i
am
the
police.
we
want
to
search
the
house
especially
that
bedroom,”
and
she
says
“okay.”
now,
i
don't
think
that
that
situation
is
any
different
than
the
matlock
situation
here.
and
i
would
submit
that
in
that
case,
a
search
without
a
search
warrant
should
not
be
upheld
by
this
court
or
any
other
court.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
well,
your
honor,
there,
the
apparent
authority
is
there.
the
police
officer
walks
in.
he
sees
a
nice
elderly
woman
or
maybe
she
is
not
so
elderly,
maybe
she
is
in
her
50's
as
some
mother-in-laws
still
are,
and
just
assume
that
she
may
be
the
mother.
they
just
assumed
that
she
has
that
apparent
authority.
that's
what
happened
in
this
case
except,
in
matlock,
i
don't
even
think
that
the
officers
assumed
that
gail
matlock
had
apparent
authority.
that
question
never
entered
their
mind.
they
had
the
man
outside
under
arrest
and
they
were
going
to
search
that
house
and
that
was
it.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference,
your
honor.
the
apparent
authority
rule,
whether
it
be
the
meter
reader
or
the
mother-in-law
or
even
a
burglar,
let’s
take
a
sophisticated
burglar
in
the
house
who
has
come
upon
by
the
doorbell
ringing
and
he’s
dressed
well
and
he
goes
to
the
door
and
says,
“well,
i’m
going
to
fool
who’s
ever
knocking
at
the
door,”
and
he
opens
the
door
he’s
an
impostor,
completely.
and
they
say,
“may
we
search
the
house,”
and
he
says,
“okay.”
now,
that’s
the
theory.
that’s
the
law
that
the
government
wants
this
court
to
adapt.
and
i
just
don’t
think
it’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
that
he
was
an
impostor.
in
this
case,
in
the
matlock
case,
the
burden
of
course
--
i
wouldn’t
have
to,
your
honor.
let
me
disagree
with
you
a
little
bit
there.
i
wouldn’t
have
to
because
there’s
no
doubt,
and
the
government
admits,
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
government.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
okay.
so
it
would
be
the
government
and
if
they
did
not,
as
the
court
--
as
both
courts
found
in
this
case
that
the
government
did
not
meet
their
burden
by
the
greater
weight
of
the
credible
evidence,
then
they’re
out
of
court.
the
next
question
here
after
we
--
if
we
get
by
that
fact
that
this
search
was
done
without
authority,
is
whether
or
not
the
lower
courts
use
the
right
rule
as
far
as
burden
of
proof.
and
in
that
regard,
i
don’t
really
think
that
the
government
argues
with
either
court.
the
--
they
have
cited
in
their
brief
and
we
cite
in
ours,
black’s
law
dictionary
which
says,
in
effect,
that
greater
weight
of
the
credible
evidence,
preponderance
of
the
evidence
are
really
the
same
thing.
the
government
cited,
which
i
am
thankful
for,
the
wisconsin
jury
instructions
which
judge
doyle
followed.
and
in
the
legislative
comment
or
in
the
comment
attached
to
the
wisconsin
jury
instructions,
the
court
noted
or
the
drafters
of
those
instructions
noted,
“greater
weight
is
exact
synonym
for
fair
preponderance.”
so,
under
either
theory,
i
don’t
think
it
makes
any
difference,
i
think
they’re
the
same.
i
agree
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
typographical
or
an
error
when
they
said
“great
weight”
rather
than
“greater
weight.”
but
i
am
assuming,
your
honors,
and
i
think
it’s
apparent
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
what
they
really
meant
was
“greater
weight”
and
not
“great
weight.”
it
does
show
that
they
read
the
government’s
brief
very
thoroughly
because
that’s
where
the
mistake
was
first
apparent
in
their
own
brief.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
they
found
it
reasonably
appear
to
the
officers
that
they
have
apparent
authority.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
no,
i
don’t
ask
that.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
oh,
alright.
okay,
alright.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
i
would
not
argue
with
their
finding
of
apparent
authority.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
the
last
argument
that
the
government
makes
is
whether
or
not
the
“reliable
hearsay”
is
admissible
or
not
admissible.
and
in
that
regard,
my
only
argument
isn't
that
hearsay
testimony
or
what
they
call
a
reliable
hearsay
testimony
is
not
substant
in
evident
--
substantive
evidence.
they
asked
that
this
court
adapt
rule
104
(a)
of
the
proposed
new
rules
of
evidence.
and
i
submit
of
course,
that
they
should
not
be
applied.
they
are
not
the
law.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
they
are,
your
honor,
much
to
the
marshalls
and
that
they
--
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
no,
your
honor.
i
was
in
the
federal
court
in
the
northern
district
of
indiana
where
the
court
is
applying
them.
wisconsin,
to
my
knowledge
has
not
yet.
i’ve
recently
appeared
in
minnesota
and
before
judge
lord
and
i’m
not
so
sure
if
he
is
yet
or
not.
the
other
thing
i
would
like
to
say,
your
honors,
is
the
--
the
government
states
that
the
leading
scholars
in
the
law
of
evidence
say
that
this
hearsay
should
be
admissible.
and
i
would
in
all
differ
--
deference
to
mr.
wigmore
and
to
mr.
mccormick,
say
that
you
are
the
leading
scholars
in
this
area
and
i
would
bow
to
your
authority
in
this
regard.
and
i
think
the
lower
courts,
both
of
them,
both
judge
doyle
and
the
seventh
circuit
were
correct
in
holding
that
this
evidence
was
not
admissible
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
facts
therein.
that,
of
course
--
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
no,
i
don’t,
your
honor.
well,
it
did
--
it
isn’t
offered
then
as
to
--
as
for
the
truth
of
any
facts
and
it’s
offered
to
prove
that
what
--
that
some
words
were
said.
just
the
fact
of
some
statements
having
been
made
which,
apparently,
was
the
basis
for
the
apparent
authority
findings
of
the
courts
below.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
well,
your
honor,
see,
here’s
the
problem
that
we
have
and
here’s
the
problem
i
have
with
the
--
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
if
you’re
going
on
apparent
authority
except
for
the
fact
that
when
the
search
was
made
the
officers
didn’t
even
know
that.
see,
that’s
the
--
the
funny
thing
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
right.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
and
that’s,
well,
true.
and
that’s
why
the
last
question
you
asked
me
about
here
(voice
overlap).
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
i
agree,
alright.
but
now,
if
we
come
to
the
apparent
authority
question,
when
the
police
officers
made
the
search
wherein
they
found
the
money
in
the
closet
there
was
not
even
any
apparent
authority
at
that
time.
and,
there,
i
would
disagree
with
the
lower
courts.
the
apparent
authority
came
in
later,
after
the
search
was
done.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
i
agree
with
them
after
they
found
the
apparent
authority
as
an
afterthought,
after
the
fact.
but
when
the
search
was
made,
your
honor,
there
was
no
apparent
authority.
there
was
nothing.
perhaps
irrelevant,
you're
(inaudible)
against
two
courts,
right?
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
no,
we
haven’t,
your
honor.
i
think
the
main
issue
here
is
the
actual
authority.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
correct,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
actual
authority
is
necessary
as
well
as
apparent
authority.
i
think
that’s
the
main
thing.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
thank
you,
your
honor,
i
appreciate
that.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
have
somewhat
of
an
advantage
over
mr.
wallace
and
that
i
was
at
all
of
the
proceedings
including
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
might
just
say
for
openers
that
when
mr.
matlock
or
somebody
because
we
don't
know
who
yet
that
legibly
robbed
the
bank
of
wyocena,
they
did
get
all
of
their
money.
i
think
the
government
is
wrong
in
many
respects
and
i
must
start
by
saying
that
we
do
have
in
this
case
a
test
of
judge
doyle,
namely,
it's
a
two-pronged
test--a
test
of
apparent
authority
as
well
as
the
magic
words
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
and
that
judge
doyle
used,
namely
actual
authority
to
search.
now,
the
government
leaves
out
a
couple
of
very,
very
important
things.
and
the
first
question,
and
that
question
was
asked
in
the
court
of
appeals,
why
no
search
warrant?
that's
the
most
important
thing
that
i
can
think
of.
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
officers
admitted
they
were
in
no
danger.
all
of
the
testimony
from
every
officer
i
specifically
asked,
were
you
in
danger
of
your
life?
no.
where
was
the
defendant
at
this
time?
he
was
handcuffed
in
the
car,
in
front
of
the
property.
now,
the
facts
in
regard
of
that,
i
believe
are
important.
the
defendant
was
arrested
outside
of
the
house.
he
either
went
out
to
walk
the
dogs
but
anyway,
he
was
outside
when
the
columbia
county
sheriff's
department
came
upon
him.
they
put
him
in
the
car.
they
admitted
at
that
time
that
they
had
no
knowledge
that
any
fruits
of
any
alleged
crime
were
in
the
house.
they
never
asked
the
defendant
his
permission
to
search
the
house.
they
never
asked
him
if
he
was
a
tenant
in
the
house.
they
never
asked
him
whether
or
not
he
paid
rent.
all
they
did
was
put
him
in
the
car
and
knocked
on
the
door.
now,
there's
a
conflict
in
testimony
as
to
whether
or
not
they
did
in
fact
knocked
on
the
door
or
whether
or
not
they
in
affect
burst
in.
the
court,
both
the
lower
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
find
that
gayle
graff,
the
paramour,
the
mistress
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
her,
in
fact,
gave
consent
to
the
police
officers
coming
in.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
well,
it
is
hard
to
tell
what
she
knows.
she
knew
she
wasn't
the
wife.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
not
then,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
some
other
time.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
she
said,
she
was
his
common
law
wife.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
not
in
wisconsin
your
honor.
at
some
southern
jurisdictions
and
other
jurisdictions,
it
might
well
be.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
you
know
that
better
than
i
do,
your
honor.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
earlier
that
day.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
yes
sir.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
this
was
the
morning,
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
hardly
got
a
chance
to
say
anything
yesterday
except
good
afternoon.
i
would
briefly
like
to
reiterate
the
facts
as
set
forth
by
the
government
because
i
think
they're
important
in
this
case
especially
in
light
of
robinson
which
mr.
justice
rehnquist
just
gave
his
opinion.
the
important
things
in
this
case
are
that
mr.
matlock
was
arrested
in
the
yard
outside
of
the
house.
he
was
placed
in
the
police
car.
the
officers
all
admitted
that
they
were
in
no
danger.
the
house
was
under
siege.
it
was
surrounded.
they
had
no
knowledge
that
any
fruits
of
any
crime
were
in
the
house.
no
questions
were
asked
as
the
defendant’s
relationship
as
an
owner,
as
a
tenant,
as
a
husband,
or
anything
else
in
relation
to
the
marshall
residence.
the
officers,
even
though
they
had
mr.
matlock
completely
under
control
in
the
car,
never
asked
his
permission
to
search
the
premises.
when
they
did
go
to
the
door,
of
course
they
did
not
have
that
very
important
thing
and
that
is
a
search
warrant.
they
never
asked
gail
graff
who
she
was.
the
officer’s
testimony
is
clear
that
when
they
came
in
the
door
she
was
standing
with
her
two-
or
three-year-old
baby.
they
never
asked
who
she
was,
whether
she
was
a
daughter,
a
wife,
or
anything
else.
they
asked
whether
or
not
they
could
search
the
house.
she
consented
to
the
search
of
the
house.
i
think
it
is
important
that
we
remember
in
this
case
that
it's
mr.
matlock’s
constitutional
rights
that
are
at
stake
here
and
not
gail
graff’s.
the
government
argues
that
there
was
a
joint
occupancy
of
that
bedroom.
now
--
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
yes,
sir?
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
pardeeville
is
about
15-20
miles
north
of
madison.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
very
small
town.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
no,
columbia
county.
madison
is
dane
county.
pardeeville
is
famous,
your
honor,
for
the
manufacture
of
athletic
score
boards.
they're
made
in
pardeeville,
wisconsin.
that's
their
claim
to
fame,
that
and
fishing,
i
think.
it's
in
columbia
county
and
this
search
was
conducted
by
the
columbia
county
sheriff’s
department
along
with,
at
the
second
and
third
search,
the
fbi.
and
even
in
the
second
and
third
searches,
which
aren't
material
to
this
case,
the
fbi
did
not
bother
to
get
a
search
warrant
either.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
one
of
the
deputies,
i
believe
his
name
was
cross,
later
testified
and
he
wasn't
there
during
the
first
search.
he
testified
that
he
knew
that
gail
graff
was
a
daughter
of
mr.
and
mrs.
marshall.
and
he
testified
that
even
though
he
didn't
know
the
relationship
of
bill
matlock
to
gail
graff,
that
at
one
time
when
he
was
visiting
the
house
he
saw
bill
matlock
come
down
from
the
upstairs.
but
that
testimony
isn't
important,
i
don't
believe,
because
he
wasn't
one
of
the
officers
who
were
involved
in
the
first
search
wherein
they
found
the
money.
now,
getting
back
to
this
joint
occupancy,
the
government
has
used
that
term
quite
often
and
i
don't
believe
it
is
in
the
record.
gail
graff
was
asked
whether
or
not
they
could
search
the
bedroom
and
she
said,
“yes,
you
may,
you
can
search
the
whole
house.”
and,
i
believe
the
testimony
is
that,
from
time
to
time,
she
slept
in
that
bedroom.
but
as
far
as
joint
occupancy
goes,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
they
jointly
occupied
the
bedroom
as
husband
and
wife
or
on
a
regular
basis.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
gail
graff
did
have
a
bedroom
of
her
own
on
the
first
floor
of
that
residence.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
no,
i
don't
because
that,
your
honor,
is
something
that
came
out
again
after
the
first
search
and
after
the
money
was
found
in
the
closet.
now
had
they
inquired
or
had
they
told,
and
that
is
an
issue
that
is
not
in
this
case
also,
had
they
told
gail
graff
“you
don't
have
to
consent.”
or
had
they
asked
her,
“are
you
the
wife?
do
you
have
joint
occupancy
of
the
bedroom?”
fine.
but
they
never
asked.
and
finally,
it
was
subsequent
to,
i
believe,
all
of
the
searches
that
she
or
--
i
guess
it
was
in
the
second
or
third
search
which
aren't
material
where
she
said,
“yes,
the
upper
two
drawers
are
mine
and
the
bottom
two
drawers
are
bill’s.”
now
in
that
regard,
your
honor,
i
think
the
inference
could
just
as
well
be
that
there
wasn't
room
in
the
house
to
store
all
clothes
and
people
were
using
everybody’s
closets.
i
think
that
the
testimony
was
very
clear
in
this
case
that
at
no
time
did
anybody
asked,
for
instance,
whose
dresses
were
hanging
up
in
the
closet.
they
could've
been
mrs.
marshall’s.
that
is
not
in
the
record
that
they
were
gail
graff’s.
the
district
court
judge
doyle
found
that
the
government
had
not
proved
by
the
greater
weight
of
the
credible
evidence
that
there
was
joint
occupancy
of
that
bedroom.
they
of
course,
also
found
that
there
was
no
evidence
except
this
“reliable
hearsay”
that
there
was
any
evidence
that
gail
graff
was
married
to
bill
matlock
or
that
she
had
authority
to
consent.
what
the
government
would
ask
this
court
to
do
at
this
time
is
to
say
that
apparent
authority
is
sufficient
and
you
don't
need
actual
authority.
now,
another
thing
that
i
believe
is
important
in
the
case
is
the
government
has
argued
before
this
court
yesterday
that
gail
graff
said
that,
“it's
my
room.”
now,
she
never
said
that
and
that
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
we
did.
we
showed
that
at
the
suppression
hearing,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
the
question
of
exclusivity
never
came
up.
i
believe,
on
my
examination
of
mr.
matlock
or
of
mrs.
marshall,
we
asked
the
questions
of,
“how
was
he
there?
what
was
he
doing?”
and
she
said
“he
is
a
paying
tenant.
he'd
paid
a
$100.00
a
month
and
he
was
current.”
and
the
judge,
judge
doyle,
made
a
finding
that
he
was
current
in
his
rent.
no
question
was
ever
asked
and
i
don't
think
it
was
inadvertent
or
on
purpose,
your
honor.
no
question
was
ever
asked
whether
or
not
gail
graff
also
was
a
paying
guest.
but
the
police
officers
never
asked
either.
it
was
myself
who
asked
on
direct
examination
of
mrs.
marshall
what
the
situation
was
as
far
as
rent
goes.
the
officers
never
inquired
at
any
time.
now
i
agree
with
the
law,
of
course
i
agree
with
it,
that
two
persons
who
have
equal
rights
may
give
legal
consent
and
that's
very
clear.
but
here,
your
honor,
and
that
was
my
next
point,
that
there
was
no
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
gail
graff
was
standing
in
the
position
of
the
defendant’s
wife,
whether
of
nor
she
also
was
paying
for
that
apart
--
for
that
bedroom,
or
whether
or
not
she
was
sleeping
any
place
else.
mr.
justice
marshall
yesterday,
raised
the
question
of
the
joint
use
of
the
diaper
bag.
and
there
again,
that's
a
question
that
was
never
raised
yesterday.
there
is
no
doubt
about
it
that
a
diaper
bag
in
this
situation,
the
very
strong
inference
is
that
it
was
used
for
diapers
for
gail
graff’s
two
or
three-year-old
son.
that
question
was
never
going
into
the
suppression
hearing.
the
main
question
in
this
case
and
the
only
real
question
is
whether
or
not
a
third
party
who
consents
is
in
fact,
or
“in
appearance,
a
joint
possessor.”
the
seventh
circuit
placed
upon
the
police
the
burden
of
determining
whether
a
person
encountered
at
the
door
has
the
authority
to
consent.
now
we
cited
numerous
cases,
and
the
government
has
also.
they
rely,
for
instance,
on
the
gorg
case.
now,
the
differentiation
in
that
case
is
that,
in
gorg,
the
police
acted
in
good
faith.
they
had
consent
and
they
had
the
request
of
the
homeowner
to
search
the
house.
the
only
question
in
that
case
was
the
right
of
the
person
who
occupied
the
room,
the
son
in
that
case.
if
you
remember,
marijuana
plants
were
found
in
the
room
after
the
son
was
arrested.
the
question
of
the
right
to
refuse
consent
was
not
present.
the
court
or
the
government
also
cites
schneckloth.
the
only
question
in
schneckloth
was
the
voluntariness
of
the
consent
to
search.
they
cite
hopper
and
in
that
case,
the
court
never
reached
the
question
of
actual
authority
because
it
ruled
that
the
consenter
did
not
even
have
apparent
authority
to
consent.
now,
yesterday,
the
question
was
asked,
mr.
wallace
of
whether
or
not
he
relied
upon
hill
and
i
would
say
today,
“yes,
he
does
rely
upon
hill”
and
he
also,
i
would
assume,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
he
now
would
rely
upon
robinson.
robinson
is
analogist
to
hill
in
one
thing
and
it's
differentiated
from
matlock
in
that,
in
hill,
the
search
was
incidental
to
an
arrest.
and
i
think
those
are
the
magic
words
that
take
matlock
out
of
the
hill
decision
and
out
of
the
robinson
decision.
this
search
was
not
in
any
manner,
shape,
or
form
incidental
to
any
arrest
of
william
matlock.
the
government
would
have
this
court
adapt
a
theory
that
ignorance
is
bliss.
we
cited
in
our
brief
at
pages
12
and
13
a
very
short
argument
in
that
regard
and
i
said,
"to
accept
the
government’s
apparent
authority
position
would
be
to
assume
that
ignorance
is
bliss.
and
when
it
comes
to
warrantless
police
searches,
the
less
the
officer
knows
and
the
less
he
takes
the
time
to
find
out
and
the
less
he
actually
finds
out,
the
better
off
his
search
becomes.
the
government
says
that
a
warrantless
search
is
reasonable
if
consented
to
by
one
who
may
appear
to
have
authority
to
consent
even
if,
in
fact,
he
does
not
have
that
authority.
now,
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
burger
came
up
with
the
thing
that
i
wish
i
had
thought
of
and
that's
mainly
the
meter
reader
being
in
the
house.
i
think
i
can
do
you
probably
one
better,
your
honor,
in
all
due
respect.
let's
take
the
weekend
guest.
let's
take
the
mother-in-law
who
comes
to
visit
and
everybody
is
out
of
the
house
except
mother-in-law,
and
up
in
the
bedroom
of
the
16-year-old
son,
he's
got
marijuana
and
heroin
and
lsd
and
all
the
other
good
things.
and
the
police
have
a
very
reliable
informant
who
says
there
are
these
things
in
the
boy’s
bedroom
and
they
walked
in
and
ring
the
door
bell
and
mother-in-law
opens
the
door
and
they
said,
“i
am
the
police.
we
want
to
search
the
house
especially
that
bedroom,”
and
she
says
“okay.”
now,
i
don't
think
that
that
situation
is
any
different
than
the
matlock
situation
here.
and
i
would
submit
that
in
that
case,
a
search
without
a
search
warrant
should
not
be
upheld
by
this
court
or
any
other
court.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
well,
your
honor,
there,
the
apparent
authority
is
there.
the
police
officer
walks
in.
he
sees
a
nice
elderly
woman
or
maybe
she
is
not
so
elderly,
maybe
she
is
in
her
50's
as
some
mother-in-laws
still
are,
and
just
assume
that
she
may
be
the
mother.
they
just
assumed
that
she
has
that
apparent
authority.
that's
what
happened
in
this
case
except,
in
matlock,
i
don't
even
think
that
the
officers
assumed
that
gail
matlock
had
apparent
authority.
that
question
never
entered
their
mind.
they
had
the
man
outside
under
arrest
and
they
were
going
to
search
that
house
and
that
was
it.
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference,
your
honor.
the
apparent
authority
rule,
whether
it
be
the
meter
reader
or
the
mother-in-law
or
even
a
burglar,
let’s
take
a
sophisticated
burglar
in
the
house
who
has
come
upon
by
the
doorbell
ringing
and
he’s
dressed
well
and
he
goes
to
the
door
and
says,
“well,
i’m
going
to
fool
who’s
ever
knocking
at
the
door,”
and
he
opens
the
door
he’s
an
impostor,
completely.
and
they
say,
“may
we
search
the
house,”
and
he
says,
“okay.”
now,
that’s
the
theory.
that’s
the
law
that
the
government
wants
this
court
to
adapt.
and
i
just
don’t
think
it’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
that
he
was
an
impostor.
in
this
case,
in
the
matlock
case,
the
burden
of
course
--
i
wouldn’t
have
to,
your
honor.
let
me
disagree
with
you
a
little
bit
there.
i
wouldn’t
have
to
because
there’s
no
doubt,
and
the
government
admits,
that
the
burden
is
upon
the
government.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
okay.
so
it
would
be
the
government
and
if
they
did
not,
as
the
court
--
as
both
courts
found
in
this
case
that
the
government
did
not
meet
their
burden
by
the
greater
weight
of
the
credible
evidence,
then
they’re
out
of
court.
the
next
question
here
after
we
--
if
we
get
by
that
fact
that
this
search
was
done
without
authority,
is
whether
or
not
the
lower
courts
use
the
right
rule
as
far
as
burden
of
proof.
and
in
that
regard,
i
don’t
really
think
that
the
government
argues
with
either
court.
the
--
they
have
cited
in
their
brief
and
we
cite
in
ours,
black’s
law
dictionary
which
says,
in
effect,
that
greater
weight
of
the
credible
evidence,
preponderance
of
the
evidence
are
really
the
same
thing.
the
government
cited,
which
i
am
thankful
for,
the
wisconsin
jury
instructions
which
judge
doyle
followed.
and
in
the
legislative
comment
or
in
the
comment
attached
to
the
wisconsin
jury
instructions,
the
court
noted
or
the
drafters
of
those
instructions
noted,
“greater
weight
is
exact
synonym
for
fair
preponderance.”
so,
under
either
theory,
i
don’t
think
it
makes
any
difference,
i
think
they’re
the
same.
i
agree
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
typographical
or
an
error
when
they
said
“great
weight”
rather
than
“greater
weight.”
but
i
am
assuming,
your
honors,
and
i
think
it’s
apparent
from
the
record
in
this
case
that
what
they
really
meant
was
“greater
weight”
and
not
“great
weight.”
it
does
show
that
they
read
the
government’s
brief
very
thoroughly
because
that’s
where
the
mistake
was
first
apparent
in
their
own
brief.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
they
found
it
reasonably
appear
to
the
officers
that
they
have
apparent
authority.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
no,
i
don’t
ask
that.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
oh,
alright.
okay,
alright.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
i
would
not
argue
with
their
finding
of
apparent
authority.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
yes,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
the
last
argument
that
the
government
makes
is
whether
or
not
the
“reliable
hearsay”
is
admissible
or
not
admissible.
and
in
that
regard,
my
only
argument
isn't
that
hearsay
testimony
or
what
they
call
a
reliable
hearsay
testimony
is
not
substant
in
evident
--
substantive
evidence.
they
asked
that
this
court
adapt
rule
104
(a)
of
the
proposed
new
rules
of
evidence.
and
i
submit
of
course,
that
they
should
not
be
applied.
they
are
not
the
law.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
they
are,
your
honor,
much
to
the
marshalls
and
that
they
--
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
no,
your
honor.
i
was
in
the
federal
court
in
the
northern
district
of
indiana
where
the
court
is
applying
them.
wisconsin,
to
my
knowledge
has
not
yet.
i’ve
recently
appeared
in
minnesota
and
before
judge
lord
and
i’m
not
so
sure
if
he
is
yet
or
not.
the
other
thing
i
would
like
to
say,
your
honors,
is
the
--
the
government
states
that
the
leading
scholars
in
the
law
of
evidence
say
that
this
hearsay
should
be
admissible.
and
i
would
in
all
differ
--
deference
to
mr.
wigmore
and
to
mr.
mccormick,
say
that
you
are
the
leading
scholars
in
this
area
and
i
would
bow
to
your
authority
in
this
regard.
and
i
think
the
lower
courts,
both
of
them,
both
judge
doyle
and
the
seventh
circuit
were
correct
in
holding
that
this
evidence
was
not
admissible
to
prove
the
truth
of
the
facts
therein.
that,
of
course
--
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
no,
i
don’t,
your
honor.
well,
it
did
--
it
isn’t
offered
then
as
to
--
as
for
the
truth
of
any
facts
and
it’s
offered
to
prove
that
what
--
that
some
words
were
said.
just
the
fact
of
some
statements
having
been
made
which,
apparently,
was
the
basis
for
the
apparent
authority
findings
of
the
courts
below.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
well,
your
honor,
see,
here’s
the
problem
that
we
have
and
here’s
the
problem
i
have
with
the
--
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
if
you’re
going
on
apparent
authority
except
for
the
fact
that
when
the
search
was
made
the
officers
didn’t
even
know
that.
see,
that’s
the
--
the
funny
thing
in
this
case.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
right.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
and
that’s,
well,
true.
and
that’s
why
the
last
question
you
asked
me
about
here
(voice
overlap).
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
i
agree,
alright.
but
now,
if
we
come
to
the
apparent
authority
question,
when
the
police
officers
made
the
search
wherein
they
found
the
money
in
the
closet
there
was
not
even
any
apparent
authority
at
that
time.
and,
there,
i
would
disagree
with
the
lower
courts.
the
apparent
authority
came
in
later,
after
the
search
was
done.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
i
agree
with
them
after
they
found
the
apparent
authority
as
an
afterthought,
after
the
fact.
but
when
the
search
was
made,
your
honor,
there
was
no
apparent
authority.
there
was
nothing.
perhaps
irrelevant,
you're
(inaudible)
against
two
courts,
right?
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
no,
we
haven’t,
your
honor.
i
think
the
main
issue
here
is
the
actual
authority.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
correct,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
actual
authority
is
necessary
as
well
as
apparent
authority.
i
think
that’s
the
main
thing.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
s.
eisenberg
thank
you,
your
honor,
i
appreciate
that.
