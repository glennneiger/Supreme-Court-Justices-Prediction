justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
officers
at
that
time
know
that
she
was
a
marshall
daughter,
and
that
the
marshalls
owned
the
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
straighten
me
out?
did
the
two
lower
courts
here
go
on
a
basis
that
there
was
no
actual
authority
for
the
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
both
of
them
found
there
was
apparent
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let’s
assume
the
rule
was
that
it
was
a
reasonable
search
if
there
was
apparent
authority.
now,
both
--
if
that
were
the
rule,
both
courts
would’ve
sustained
the
search
below.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
so
you
asked
us
to
--
in
effect
to
disagree
with
both
courts
with
respect
to
apparent
authority
in
the
first
place.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don’t?
i
thought
you
said
that
there
was
no
apparent
authority
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
ask
us
then
to
--
do
you
say,
“alright,
there
was
apparent
authority”
or
not?
both
courts
found
that
to
be
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
was
apparent
authority
and
you
rest
your
case
then
on
that
there
must
be
actual
authority,
that
they
should
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
apparent
authority.
that’s
what
the
case
turns
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
it
was
admissible
to
prove
apparent
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn’t
that
true
so
far?
that's
a
--
if
you’re
going
on
apparent
authority,
with
respect
to
apparent
authority,
you
might
get
a
different
answer
on
admissibility
than
with
respect
to
actual
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
maybe
a
different
--
that
that's
a
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn’t
a
hearsay
objective.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
just
an
irrelevancy
that
--
but
it’s
not
a
hearsay.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
case,
the
federal
officers
seized
certain
evidence
in
the
course
of
searching
the
house.
they
had
no
warrant,
but
relied
on
consent
of
one
of
the
occupants.
the
district
court
held
that
the
consent
was
invalid
and
suppressed
the
evidence,
court
of
appeals
affirmed
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
on
file.
we
in
turn
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceeding.
