you
may

when
you're
ready.
chief

excuse
me,
mr.

it
was
at
a
later
point
in
the
day
not
at
the
time
of
the
consent
that
this
lady
said
that
she
was
the
common
law
wife
of
the
respondent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
let's
take
an
extreme
situation
mr.
wallace.
let's
assumed
that
the
meter
readers
on
the
porch
or
up
in
the
yard
and
they
asked
him
if
they
may
enter
and
the
door
is
open
and
he
said
"be
my
guest",
the
usual
vernacular
and
they
go
in,
would
you
say
that
that's
covered
by
your
rule
too?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
need
to
go
that
far
for
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
among
other
things,
is
this
might
be
relevant
then
on
the
hypothetical
case
i
gave
you.
it
might
be
relevant
to
find
out
whether
they
ask
the
man,
"do
you
live
here?"
and
if
he--they
had
asked
him
that
question
and
he
said,
"yes,
i
do",
you
might
have
one
result.
and
if
they
didn't
ask
him
that
question,
you
might
conceivably
have
another
result.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
she
is
in
the
house,
at
the
kitchen
sink
washing
the
dishes.
you
think
they
might
not
have
to
ask
her
very
much
after
the
objective
evidence
that
she
was
lawfully
there
and
perhaps
live
there.
chief
justice
warren
e.

mr.

chief
justice

e.

she
thought
she
was
the
wife
of
the
defendant,
didn't
she?
chief
justice
warren
e.

she
said
she
was.
chief
justice
warren
e.

i
am
speaking
of
--
chief
justice
warren
e.

she
did
say
that
she
was
his
wife.
chief

e.

well,
that
is
wife.
chief

chief

wasn't
there
some
testimony
that
she
had
the
top
two
drawers
in
the
dresser
and
he
had
the
bottom
two?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
not
think
that
permits
any
inference
of
joint
occupancy?
chief
justice
warren
e.

he
didn't
undertake
to
prove,
for
example,
that
he
rented
that
room
and
paid
$75.00
a
month
and
that
it
was
his
room
exclusively?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
exclusively?
it
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
on
the
suppression
hearing,
however,
the
testimony
would
be
developed,
i

reader,
not
really
an
occupant
of
that
house,
and
neither
actual
nor
apparent
authority
to
consent
to
any
entry.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
then
on
your
suppression
hearing
you
would
demonstrate
his
infirmities
of
his
situation,
wouldn’t
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.

no
question
about
that.
chief

chief
