mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
on
a
motion
to
suppress
in
connection
with
respondents
as
yet
untried
inditement
for
bank
robbery.
respondent
was
arrested
by
local
police
officers
at
about
9:30
a.m.
in
the
yard
of
a
farmhouse
rented
by
mr.
and
mrs.
walter
marshall.
immediately
after
his
arrest,
three
officers
went
to
the
door
of
the
marshall
house
and
were
admitted
by
the
marshall's
21-year-old
daughter,
mrs.
gayle
graff
who
had
her
three-year-old
son
with
her
and
apparently,
they
were
the
only
ones
in
the
house
at
that
time.
the
officers
had
no
search
warrant.
they
told
her
that
they
were
looking
for
money
and
a
gun
and
asked
if
they
could
come
in
and
make
a
search.
she
consented
and
in
response
to
their
questions,
told
the
officers
that
she
and
the
respondent
jointly
occupied
an
upstairs
bedroom
in
which
they
slept
in
the
same
bed.
she
specifically
gave
them
permission
to
search
that
room.
they
found
that
it
contained
a
double
bed
with
two
pillows
on
it
which
gave
the
appearance
of
having
been
slept
in
and
there
was
men's
and
women's
clothing
in
the
closet.
there
was
also
a
four
drawer
bureau,
two
drawers
of
which
contained
men's
clothing
and
two
drawers
of
which
contained
women's
clothing
including
underclothing.
and
mrs.
graff
told
the
officers
that
the
respondent
has
the
two
bottom
drawers
and
at
the
top
two
drawers
were
hers.
in
the
closet,
the
officers
found
a
diaper
bag
half
filled
with
a
large
amount
of
cash,
several
thousand
dollars.
the
government's
petition
in
this
court
contest
only
the
suppression
by
the
courts
below
of
this
cash
found
in
the
closet.
no
issue
is
raised
in
this
court
with
respect
to
two
later
searches
or
the
suppression
of
some
of
the
items
found
during
those
searches.
the
district
court--now
i
have
recounted
only
the
facts
known
to
the
officers
at
the
time
they
conducted
the
search.
the
district
court--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
she
did
not
make
that
remark
later
in
the
day
at
the
police
headquarters.
the
district
court
held
and
the
facts
that
i
have
recounted
that
prior
to
the
search
of
the
issue,
it
reasonably
appeared
to
the
searching
officers
that
mrs.
graff
had
the
right
to
consent
to
the
search
or
in
other
words,
it
was
reasonable
for
the
officers
to
rely
on
her
consent
in
making
the
search
but
the
court
held
that
this
satisfied
only
one
part
of
a
two-pronged
test
that
the
government
must
meet
in
this
situation.
it
held
that
the
government
must
also
prove
that
she
actually
have
the
right
to
consent
to
the
search
and
it
further
held
that
excluding
all
hearsay,
testimony
which
was
introduced
to
show
the
actual
right.
the
government
had
failed
to
meet
its
burden
on
the
second
prong
of
the
test.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
in
all
respects
although
there
was
a
difference
between
the
two
courts
in
the
formulation
of
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
government
to
which
i
shall
allude
later.
our
principal
contention
in
this
court
is
that
the
two-pronged
test
applied
by
the
courts
below
is
erroneous.
in
conducting
an
investigation,
we
contend
police
officers
must
act
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
as
they
appear
at
the
time
of
the
investigation.
what
the
fourth
amendment
requires
is
that
their
action
be
reasonable
at
the
time
it
is
undertaken.
just
as
an
entry
made
without
probable
cause
cannot
be
validated
by
what
the
search
later
turns
up,
so
the
reverse
is
also
true.
a
subsequent
discovery
that
the
police
were
misled
by
deceptive
appearances
does
not
invalidate
the
search
if
it
was
reasonable
for
them
to
rely
on
those
appearances
in
undertaking
the
search.
that
was
the
holding
of
this
court
in
hill
against
california
in
401
u.s.
797
in
which
the
police
conducted
a
search
incident
to
the
arrest
of
a
man,
they
reasonably
but
mistakenly
believed
to
be
the
defendant.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
emphasized
that
sufficient
probability,
not
certainty
is
the
touchstone
of
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
said
that
the
arrest
in
that
case
was
again
"a
reasonable
response
to
the
situation
facing
them,
the
police
officers
at
that
time".
similarly
here,
the
courts
below
correctly
found,
finding
that
it
is
not
a
challenge
in
this
court
that
the
officers
responded
reasonably
to
the
situation
they
found.
since
their
glass
was
at
total
absence
of
official
misconduct,
there
was,
we
contend
no
fourth
amendment
violation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
not
with
the
situation
we
have
here.
we
think
that
hill
against
california
says
a
great
deal
about
that
hypothetical
situation
but
i
think
that
the
answer
has
to
be
that
what
inquiries
are
reasonable
on
the
part
of
the
police
officers
depends
on
the
situation.
here,
there
was
no
reason
for
them
to
doubt
and
that
she
was
rightfully
in
the
house.
it
was
9:30
in
the
morning,
she
answered
the
door
with
her
little
child
with
her
and
she
had
previously
come
out
of
the
door
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
with
respect
to
the
arrest
of
the
respondent
whom
she
referred
to
as
bill.
there
was
every
indication
that
they
resided
in
the
house.
so,
i
don't
think
the
court
need
deal
with
the
situation
of
an
imposter
until
that
case
arises.
so,
one
might
surmise
that
an
imposter
for
example,
a
burglar
would
be
reluctant
to
consent
to
a
search
because
of
the
problem
that
he
might
then
be
arrested
if
something
were
found
by
the
officers
and
it
would
then
be
found
out
that
he
was
not
rightfully
there.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
it
had
reasonably
appeared
to
the
police
officers,
reasonably
appeared
to
them
that
he
had
the
authority
to
consent
to
the
search
that
he
was
consenting
to.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
don't
need
to
because
as
i
say,
the
facts
here
were
such
that
it
was
readily
apparent
that
she
was
residing
in
the
house.
i
think
that
the
general
principle
really
is
the
same.
i
don't
see
that
the
fourth
amendment
has
any
meaning
except
that
the
police
in
conducting
their
investigations
have
to
act
reasonably
in
the
context
of
the
situation
as
it
appears
to
them.
not
just,
as
it
appear
to
them
in
good
faith,
but
as
it
reasonably
appears
to
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
differences
in
the
circumstances
would
indicate
that
it
would
be
reasonable
for
them
to
ask
additional
questions
in
some
situations.
in
this
case,
although
they
did
not
ask
her
where
she
slept,
she
volunteered
that
information
to
them
before
they
undertook
the
search
and
there
was
no
need
for
them
to
ask.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
there
might
be
some
question
that
she
might
be
a
domestic
employee.
in
this
case,
it
was
apparent
from
her
conduct
that
she
was
not
addressing
the
respondent
as
if
she
were
a
domestic
employee.
besides
which
she
identified
the
room
where
the
two
of
them
slept
as
being
her
room
and
stated
that
her
clothing
was
there.
and
i
think
the
courts
below
correctly
held
that
it
was
reasonable
for
the
police
officers
to
act
on
that
information.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
--
the
marshalls
rented
the
house
mr.
justice.
the
record
is
not
clear
on
what
they
knew.
this
was
a
rural
area
where
a
lot
of
the
people
knew
one
another.
the
record
is
not
clear
on
that.
it
does
indicate
that
one
of
the
officers
had
observed
her
living
there
prior
to
the
day
of
the
search.
but
it
does
not
indicate
whether
he
knew
that
she
was
a
daughter
of
the
marshalls.
this
later
became
apparent.
now,
since
there
was
no
finding
of
official
misconduct
of
any
kind,
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
function
and
exclusionary
rule
would
perform
in
a
situation
on
this
sort,
which
i
think
means
primarily
that
there
is
no
reason
to
hold
that
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation
since
the
officers
conducted
a
reasonable
search.
but
we
contend
also
that
it
means
even
if
the
court
should
hold
that
there
was
something
technically
wrong
with
the
search
under
the
fourth
amendment
that
the
exclusionary
rule
should
not
be
applied
to
these
factual
circumstances
since
the
officers
acted
in
a
responsible,
reasonable
way
and
presumably
would
act
in
the
same
way
if
the
facts
were
to
arise
again.
now,
the
courts
below
seemed
to
believe
that
consent
searches
should
be
treated
differently
with
respect
to
what
this
court
has
held
that
the
conduct
of
the
officers
and
the
circumstances
as
they
find
it
should
be
the
touchstone.
they
formulated
the
situation
of
a
consent
search
as
really
involving
an
agency
question
or
a
question
of
the
authority
of
one
person
to
wave
the
constitutional
the
rights
of
someone
else.
we
don't
believe
that
this
is
the
accurate
formulation
of
what's
involved
here
and
indeed,
two
recent
opinions
of
this
court
have
indicated
that
the
question
is
not
a
question
of
waiver.
i'm
referring
to
the
opinion
shneckloth
against
bustamonte
and
also
the
opinion
in
coolidge
against
new
hampshire.
instead,
it
is
really
a
question
of
the
joint
occupant's
own
right
to
authorize
a
search
of
the
premises
where
she
lives
as
indicated
in
the
court's
holding
in
frazier
against
cupp
with
respect
to
a
jointly
used
duffel
bag
which
one
of
the
users
gave
the
police
permission
to
search.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
we
have
raised
now
issue
with
respect
to
anything
that
sound
in
the
bureau,
you
honor,
because
we
did
not--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
--
that
was
why
we
raise
no
issue
with
respect
towards
to
keep
the
case
from
having
those
additional
complications.
the
only
thing
contested
here
is
what
was
found
in
the
closet
which
they
both
used.
so,
our
principle--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
was
no
showing
about
it
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
that
difference
but
there
was
joint
use
of
the
closet
and
the
bag
was
hanging
in
the
closet.
there
was
no
indication
that
it
wasn't
used
by
either
or
both
of
them
and
the
bag
contained
nothing
but
the
cash.
it
was
half
filled
with
cash.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there's
been
no
trial
yet
about
who
stole
anything.
now,
that
is
our
principal
contention
and
if
the
court
agrees
with
that
contention,
that
is
the
only
issue
it
need
to
side.
should
the
court
disagree
with
that
contention,
we
raise
two
additional
issues
with
respect
to
the
proof
of
actual
authority
that
was
required
in
this
case.
one
issue
is
that
under
this
court's
recent
decision
in
lego
against
twomey.
it's
clear
that
if
the
government
is
held
to
have
to
prove
actual
authority,
the
standard
of
proof,
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
government
is
to
prove
that
via
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
yet,
the
court
of
appeals,
not
the
district
court
but
the
court
of
appeals
reviewed
this
case
on
the
basis
of
what
we
believe
to
be
a
substantially
heavier
burden
of
proof
namely,
whether
the
government
proved
"to
a
reasonable
certainty"
by
the
great
weight
of
the
credible
evidence
that
mrs.
graff
had
actual
authority
to
consent
to
the
search.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
district
court
used
a
standard
which
is
essentially
the
same
as
preponderance
of
the
evidence
whether
they
have
improve
to
a
reasonable
certainty
by
the
greater
weight
of
the
evidence--of
the
credible
evidence
that
she
had
actual
authority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
believe
the
effect
is,
that
we
didn't
get
the
review
we
were
entitled
to
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
reviewing
whether
we
met
our
burden
of
proof
because
they
held
us
to
a
stricter
burden
of
proof
than
what's
appropriate
against
our
contention
that
they
should
not
hold
this
at
that
burden
of
proof.
unfortunately,
the
government's
brief
said
that
that
was
the
burden
which
the
district
court
that
held
us
to.
that
was
an
error
in
the
governments
brief.
but
that
brief
did
not
leave
the
court
of
appeals
into
the
error
they
made
because,
we
said
that
that
was
the
erroneous
standard
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"no,
we
adapt
that
as
the
correct
standard."
[laughter]
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
was
unfortunate
but
we
were
not
contending
for
that
standard
and
i
don't
think
if
there's
any
basis
for
holding
the
government
to
that
standard
of
reviewing
the
court
of
appeals.
that
as
i
say,
that
issue
need
not
be
reached
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
principal
contention.
there
is
an
additional
issue
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
the
hill
case,
we
believe
is
virtually
controlling
here
and
i
mentioned
the
language
that
seems
most
closely
in
point
as
well
as
the
similarity
in
the
facts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
not
a
consent
search
but
the
court
recently
said
in
schneckloth
against
bustamonte
that
consent
searches
are
to
be
encouraged
such
as
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
in
a
number
of
recent
opinions
that
the
cooperation
of
third
parties
with
the
police
is
not
to
be
discouraged
and
miranda
against
arizona
is
one
and
a
passage
quoted
in
schneckloth's
and
coolidge
is
another
opinion
that
has
made
that
point
and
it
is
to
remembered
that
all
of
this
arises
in
context
in
which
any
mistake
that
is
made
even
on
the
part
of
the
police,
a
reasonable
good
faith
mistake
or
in
the
determinations
made
at
the
hearing
are
not
going
to
cause
a
risk
of
the
conviction
of
an
innocent
person
or
any
impediment
of
the
truth
finding
process.
at
worst,
they
will
lead
to
the
introduction
of
additional
evidence
to
be
considered
for
his
inherent
value.
the
part
for
any
errors
that
occurred
during
the
course
of
the
prior
proceedings
and
it's
likely
that
this
will
lead
to
a
more
accurate
determination
of
the
truth,
probably
than
cause
any
impediment
to
the
determination
of
the
truth
at
the
trial.
so,
for
that
reason,
as
well,
we
have
raised
an
additional
issue
in
the
case,
should
the
court
disagree
with
principal
contention,
otherwise
it
doesn't
arise.
and
that
is
that
hearsay
testimony
should
be
received
at
a
suppression
hearing.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
refused
to
consider
any
of
the
very
considerable
and
we
think
inherently
reliable
hearsay
testimony
that
was
authored
by
the
government
to
show
that
indeed
mrs.
graff
was
living
in
the
bedroom
and
did
have
the
authority
there
for
the
consent
to
a
search
of
that
room
and
of
the
closet
which
she
was
using.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
found
in
the
closet
of
the
bedroom
in
a
duffle
bag
hanging
in
the
closet.
not
on
a
duffle
bag
but
a
diaper
bag
and
the
closet
have
men's
and
women's
clothing
in
it
and
it
was
the
bedroom
that
they
jointly
occupied.
and
we've
raised
this
additional
issue
which
the
court
has
recently
addressed
in
the
proposed
federal
rules
of
evidence
in
the
provision
that
we
quote
on
page
28
of
our
brief
and
it's
a
position
that
is
widely
supported
by
the
leading
scholars
in
the
law
of
evidence
as
we
explain
in
this
portion
of
our
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
evidence
is
not
specific
about
the
diaper
bag
itself
in
this
case.
the
evidence
is
that
she
consented
to
a
search
of
the
room
including
the
closet
and
they
found
the
diaper
bag
in
the
closet
to
contain
the
money.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
about
discussion
of
the
diaper
bag
itself.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that's
our
position,
a
bag
hanging
in
the
closet
that
she
uses
within
the
clear
view
of
her
occupancy.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
now
what
you
say
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
something
else.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
then
there
would
be--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
right.
that
her
occupancy
of
the
room
and
the
closet
gave
her
the
authority
to
open
the
bag
since
it
was
right
there
hanging
in
her
closet.
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
the
closet
that
she
jointly
uses.
it
was
as
much
her
closet
as
it
was
the
duffle
bag
of
the
man
who
gave
the
consent
in
frazier
against
cupp,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
was
the
situation
there.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is
no
proof
on
that,
one
way
of
the
other
about
any
uses
of
that
that
bag
has
been
put
through
in
the
past.
so,
my
point
that
is,
that
she
was
using
it
for
her
child,
otherwise
why
do
they
have
a
diaper
bag?
well,
that
was
its
current
use
but
the
reasonable
inference
is
that
the
lady
with
the
three-year-old
boy
was
the
one
who
would
be
using
the
diaper
bag.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
oh,
the
owner
of
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
they
rented
the
house
mr.
justice,
the
owners
were
settling
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
at
all
about
her
father.
her
mother
was
at
work
and
came
and
was--came
home
later
in
the
afternoon
and
there
was
no
indication
that
anyone
else
was
in
the
house
at
that
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
i
think
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
just
want
to
reinforce
what
has
already
been
said
that
the
courts
have
found
apparent
authority
in
this
case.

the
findings
on
which
the

based
its
holding
that
there
was
apparent

includes
the
statement
right

she
told
the
officers
that
the
east
bedroom
was
occupied
by
the
defendant
and
by
her.”
she
then
consented
to
a
search
of
the
east
bedroom.
she
told
the
officers
that
she
used
the
top
two
drawers
of
the
dresser
in
the
east
bedroom
and
the
defendant
used
the
bottom
two
drawers.
this
was
upheld.
these
findings
were
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals
on

of
the
same
appendix
at
the
end
of
the
paragraph
that
ends
at
the

that
she
then
told
the
officers
that
she
and
defendant
both
occupied
the
east
bedroom
and
that
the
woman’s
clothing
therein
contained
were
hers.
and,
that
she
told
the
officers
that
she
used
the
two
upper
drawers
of
the
dresser
in
the
room
and
the
defendant
used
the
two
lower
drawers.
without
burdening
the
court
to
read,
all
the
excerpts
in
the
record
which
support
that
i
can
cite
in
the
printed
appendix
to
page
13,
page
15,
page
16,
and
page
18
which
is
testimony
by
each
of
the
three
officers
that
conducted
the
search,
all
supporting
that
she
said
that
this
was
her
bedroom,
that
she
slept
in
the
same
bed
with
the
defendant
there.
now,
there’s
just
one
other
factor
in
response
to
the
question
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
been
asking
about
whether
any
of
the
officers
who
conducted
the
search
knew
who
she
was.
the
only
indication
in
the
record
on
that
does
not
relate
to
her
specifically
but
to
mr.
matlock,
the
respondent
himself.
and,
that
appears
at
a
portion
of
the
transcript
that
was
not
reprinted
in
the
appendix.
on
page
78
of
the
transcript
in
the
course
of
the
interrogation
of
officer
cross
who
was
one
of
the
officers
who
conducted
this
search,
they
asked
him,
“did
you
know
whether
or
not
he
lived
in
that
house?”
and
he
said,
“yes,
sir.”
“how
did
you
know
that?”
“well,
i
had
seen
him
there.
my
father
knew
the
marshall
family
and
through
that,
i
knew
he
was
staying
there.”
that
is
all
that
appears
in
the
record
on
that
subject.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
that’s
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
arises
on
a
motion
to
suppress
in
connection
with
respondents
as
yet
untried
inditement
for
bank
robbery.
respondent
was
arrested
by
local
police
officers
at
about
9:30
a.m.
in
the
yard
of
a
farmhouse
rented
by
mr.
and
mrs.
walter
marshall.
immediately
after
his
arrest,
three
officers
went
to
the
door
of
the
marshall
house
and
were
admitted
by
the
marshall's
21-year-old
daughter,
mrs.
gayle
graff
who
had
her
three-year-old
son
with
her
and
apparently,
they
were
the
only
ones
in
the
house
at
that
time.
the
officers
had
no
search
warrant.
they
told
her
that
they
were
looking
for
money
and
a
gun
and
asked
if
they
could
come
in
and
make
a
search.
she
consented
and
in
response
to
their
questions,
told
the
officers
that
she
and
the
respondent
jointly
occupied
an
upstairs
bedroom
in
which
they
slept
in
the
same
bed.
she
specifically
gave
them
permission
to
search
that
room.
they
found
that
it
contained
a
double
bed
with
two
pillows
on
it
which
gave
the
appearance
of
having
been
slept
in
and
there
was
men's
and
women's
clothing
in
the
closet.
there
was
also
a
four
drawer
bureau,
two
drawers
of
which
contained
men's
clothing
and
two
drawers
of
which
contained
women's
clothing
including
underclothing.
and
mrs.
graff
told
the
officers
that
the
respondent
has
the
two
bottom
drawers
and
at
the
top
two
drawers
were
hers.
in
the
closet,
the
officers
found
a
diaper
bag
half
filled
with
a
large
amount
of
cash,
several
thousand
dollars.
the
government's
petition
in
this
court
contest
only
the
suppression
by
the
courts
below
of
this
cash
found
in
the
closet.
no
issue
is
raised
in
this
court
with
respect
to
two
later
searches
or
the
suppression
of
some
of
the
items
found
during
those
searches.
the
district
court--now
i
have
recounted
only
the
facts
known
to
the
officers
at
the
time
they
conducted
the
search.
the
district
court--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
she
did
not
make
that
remark
later
in
the
day
at
the
police
headquarters.
the
district
court
held
and
the
facts
that
i
have
recounted
that
prior
to
the
search
of
the
issue,
it
reasonably
appeared
to
the
searching
officers
that
mrs.
graff
had
the
right
to
consent
to
the
search
or
in
other
words,
it
was
reasonable
for
the
officers
to
rely
on
her
consent
in
making
the
search
but
the
court
held
that
this
satisfied
only
one
part
of
a
two-pronged
test
that
the
government
must
meet
in
this
situation.
it
held
that
the
government
must
also
prove
that
she
actually
have
the
right
to
consent
to
the
search
and
it
further
held
that
excluding
all
hearsay,
testimony
which
was
introduced
to
show
the
actual
right.
the
government
had
failed
to
meet
its
burden
on
the
second
prong
of
the
test.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
in
all
respects
although
there
was
a
difference
between
the
two
courts
in
the
formulation
of
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
government
to
which
i
shall
allude
later.
our
principal
contention
in
this
court
is
that
the
two-pronged
test
applied
by
the
courts
below
is
erroneous.
in
conducting
an
investigation,
we
contend
police
officers
must
act
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
as
they
appear
at
the
time
of
the
investigation.
what
the
fourth
amendment
requires
is
that
their
action
be
reasonable
at
the
time
it
is
undertaken.
just
as
an
entry
made
without
probable
cause
cannot
be
validated
by
what
the
search
later
turns
up,
so
the
reverse
is
also
true.
a
subsequent
discovery
that
the
police
were
misled
by
deceptive
appearances
does
not
invalidate
the
search
if
it
was
reasonable
for
them
to
rely
on
those
appearances
in
undertaking
the
search.
that
was
the
holding
of
this
court
in
hill
against
california
in
401
u.s.
797
in
which
the
police
conducted
a
search
incident
to
the
arrest
of
a
man,
they
reasonably
but
mistakenly
believed
to
be
the
defendant.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
emphasized
that
sufficient
probability,
not
certainty
is
the
touchstone
of
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
said
that
the
arrest
in
that
case
was
again
"a
reasonable
response
to
the
situation
facing
them,
the
police
officers
at
that
time".
similarly
here,
the
courts
below
correctly
found,
finding
that
it
is
not
a
challenge
in
this
court
that
the
officers
responded
reasonably
to
the
situation
they
found.
since
their
glass
was
at
total
absence
of
official
misconduct,
there
was,
we
contend
no
fourth
amendment
violation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
not
with
the
situation
we
have
here.
we
think
that
hill
against
california
says
a
great
deal
about
that
hypothetical
situation
but
i
think
that
the
answer
has
to
be
that
what
inquiries
are
reasonable
on
the
part
of
the
police
officers
depends
on
the
situation.
here,
there
was
no
reason
for
them
to
doubt
and
that
she
was
rightfully
in
the
house.
it
was
9:30
in
the
morning,
she
answered
the
door
with
her
little
child
with
her
and
she
had
previously
come
out
of
the
door
to
find
out
what
was
going
on
with
respect
to
the
arrest
of
the
respondent
whom
she
referred
to
as
bill.
there
was
every
indication
that
they
resided
in
the
house.
so,
i
don't
think
the
court
need
deal
with
the
situation
of
an
imposter
until
that
case
arises.
so,
one
might
surmise
that
an
imposter
for
example,
a
burglar
would
be
reluctant
to
consent
to
a
search
because
of
the
problem
that
he
might
then
be
arrested
if
something
were
found
by
the
officers
and
it
would
then
be
found
out
that
he
was
not
rightfully
there.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
it
had
reasonably
appeared
to
the
police
officers,
reasonably
appeared
to
them
that
he
had
the
authority
to
consent
to
the
search
that
he
was
consenting
to.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
don't
need
to
because
as
i
say,
the
facts
here
were
such
that
it
was
readily
apparent
that
she
was
residing
in
the
house.
i
think
that
the
general
principle
really
is
the
same.
i
don't
see
that
the
fourth
amendment
has
any
meaning
except
that
the
police
in
conducting
their
investigations
have
to
act
reasonably
in
the
context
of
the
situation
as
it
appears
to
them.
not
just,
as
it
appear
to
them
in
good
faith,
but
as
it
reasonably
appears
to
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
differences
in
the
circumstances
would
indicate
that
it
would
be
reasonable
for
them
to
ask
additional
questions
in
some
situations.
in
this
case,
although
they
did
not
ask
her
where
she
slept,
she
volunteered
that
information
to
them
before
they
undertook
the
search
and
there
was
no
need
for
them
to
ask.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
there
might
be
some
question
that
she
might
be
a
domestic
employee.
in
this
case,
it
was
apparent
from
her
conduct
that
she
was
not
addressing
the
respondent
as
if
she
were
a
domestic
employee.
besides
which
she
identified
the
room
where
the
two
of
them
slept
as
being
her
room
and
stated
that
her
clothing
was
there.
and
i
think
the
courts
below
correctly
held
that
it
was
reasonable
for
the
police
officers
to
act
on
that
information.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
--
the
marshalls
rented
the
house
mr.
justice.
the
record
is
not
clear
on
what
they
knew.
this
was
a
rural
area
where
a
lot
of
the
people
knew
one
another.
the
record
is
not
clear
on
that.
it
does
indicate
that
one
of
the
officers
had
observed
her
living
there
prior
to
the
day
of
the
search.
but
it
does
not
indicate
whether
he
knew
that
she
was
a
daughter
of
the
marshalls.
this
later
became
apparent.
now,
since
there
was
no
finding
of
official
misconduct
of
any
kind,
it
is
difficult
to
see
what
function
and
exclusionary
rule
would
perform
in
a
situation
on
this
sort,
which
i
think
means
primarily
that
there
is
no
reason
to
hold
that
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation
since
the
officers
conducted
a
reasonable
search.
but
we
contend
also
that
it
means
even
if
the
court
should
hold
that
there
was
something
technically
wrong
with
the
search
under
the
fourth
amendment
that
the
exclusionary
rule
should
not
be
applied
to
these
factual
circumstances
since
the
officers
acted
in
a
responsible,
reasonable
way
and
presumably
would
act
in
the
same
way
if
the
facts
were
to
arise
again.
now,
the
courts
below
seemed
to
believe
that
consent
searches
should
be
treated
differently
with
respect
to
what
this
court
has
held
that
the
conduct
of
the
officers
and
the
circumstances
as
they
find
it
should
be
the
touchstone.
they
formulated
the
situation
of
a
consent
search
as
really
involving
an
agency
question
or
a
question
of
the
authority
of
one
person
to
wave
the
constitutional
the
rights
of
someone
else.
we
don't
believe
that
this
is
the
accurate
formulation
of
what's
involved
here
and
indeed,
two
recent
opinions
of
this
court
have
indicated
that
the
question
is
not
a
question
of
waiver.
i'm
referring
to
the
opinion
shneckloth
against
bustamonte
and
also
the
opinion
in
coolidge
against
new
hampshire.
instead,
it
is
really
a
question
of
the
joint
occupant's
own
right
to
authorize
a
search
of
the
premises
where
she
lives
as
indicated
in
the
court's
holding
in
frazier
against
cupp
with
respect
to
a
jointly
used
duffel
bag
which
one
of
the
users
gave
the
police
permission
to
search.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well
we
have
raised
now
issue
with
respect
to
anything
that
sound
in
the
bureau,
you
honor,
because
we
did
not--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
--
that
was
why
we
raise
no
issue
with
respect
towards
to
keep
the
case
from
having
those
additional
complications.
the
only
thing
contested
here
is
what
was
found
in
the
closet
which
they
both
used.
so,
our
principle--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
was
no
showing
about
it
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
that
difference
but
there
was
joint
use
of
the
closet
and
the
bag
was
hanging
in
the
closet.
there
was
no
indication
that
it
wasn't
used
by
either
or
both
of
them
and
the
bag
contained
nothing
but
the
cash.
it
was
half
filled
with
cash.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there's
been
no
trial
yet
about
who
stole
anything.
now,
that
is
our
principal
contention
and
if
the
court
agrees
with
that
contention,
that
is
the
only
issue
it
need
to
side.
should
the
court
disagree
with
that
contention,
we
raise
two
additional
issues
with
respect
to
the
proof
of
actual
authority
that
was
required
in
this
case.
one
issue
is
that
under
this
court's
recent
decision
in
lego
against
twomey.
it's
clear
that
if
the
government
is
held
to
have
to
prove
actual
authority,
the
standard
of
proof,
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
government
is
to
prove
that
via
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
yet,
the
court
of
appeals,
not
the
district
court
but
the
court
of
appeals
reviewed
this
case
on
the
basis
of
what
we
believe
to
be
a
substantially
heavier
burden
of
proof
namely,
whether
the
government
proved
"to
a
reasonable
certainty"
by
the
great
weight
of
the
credible
evidence
that
mrs.
graff
had
actual
authority
to
consent
to
the
search.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
district
court
used
a
standard
which
is
essentially
the
same
as
preponderance
of
the
evidence
whether
they
have
improve
to
a
reasonable
certainty
by
the
greater
weight
of
the
evidence--of
the
credible
evidence
that
she
had
actual
authority.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
believe
the
effect
is,
that
we
didn't
get
the
review
we
were
entitled
to
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
reviewing
whether
we
met
our
burden
of
proof
because
they
held
us
to
a
stricter
burden
of
proof
than
what's
appropriate
against
our
contention
that
they
should
not
hold
this
at
that
burden
of
proof.
unfortunately,
the
government's
brief
said
that
that
was
the
burden
which
the
district
court
that
held
us
to.
that
was
an
error
in
the
governments
brief.
but
that
brief
did
not
leave
the
court
of
appeals
into
the
error
they
made
because,
we
said
that
that
was
the
erroneous
standard
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
"no,
we
adapt
that
as
the
correct
standard."
[laughter]
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
was
unfortunate
but
we
were
not
contending
for
that
standard
and
i
don't
think
if
there's
any
basis
for
holding
the
government
to
that
standard
of
reviewing
the
court
of
appeals.
that
as
i
say,
that
issue
need
not
be
reached
if
the
court
agrees
with
our
principal
contention.
there
is
an
additional
issue
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
the
hill
case,
we
believe
is
virtually
controlling
here
and
i
mentioned
the
language
that
seems
most
closely
in
point
as
well
as
the
similarity
in
the
facts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
not
a
consent
search
but
the
court
recently
said
in
schneckloth
against
bustamonte
that
consent
searches
are
to
be
encouraged
such
as
the
court
has
repeatedly
said
in
a
number
of
recent
opinions
that
the
cooperation
of
third
parties
with
the
police
is
not
to
be
discouraged
and
miranda
against
arizona
is
one
and
a
passage
quoted
in
schneckloth's
and
coolidge
is
another
opinion
that
has
made
that
point
and
it
is
to
remembered
that
all
of
this
arises
in
context
in
which
any
mistake
that
is
made
even
on
the
part
of
the
police,
a
reasonable
good
faith
mistake
or
in
the
determinations
made
at
the
hearing
are
not
going
to
cause
a
risk
of
the
conviction
of
an
innocent
person
or
any
impediment
of
the
truth
finding
process.
at
worst,
they
will
lead
to
the
introduction
of
additional
evidence
to
be
considered
for
his
inherent
value.
the
part
for
any
errors
that
occurred
during
the
course
of
the
prior
proceedings
and
it's
likely
that
this
will
lead
to
a
more
accurate
determination
of
the
truth,
probably
than
cause
any
impediment
to
the
determination
of
the
truth
at
the
trial.
so,
for
that
reason,
as
well,
we
have
raised
an
additional
issue
in
the
case,
should
the
court
disagree
with
principal
contention,
otherwise
it
doesn't
arise.
and
that
is
that
hearsay
testimony
should
be
received
at
a
suppression
hearing.
in
this
case,
the
district
court
refused
to
consider
any
of
the
very
considerable
and
we
think
inherently
reliable
hearsay
testimony
that
was
authored
by
the
government
to
show
that
indeed
mrs.
graff
was
living
in
the
bedroom
and
did
have
the
authority
there
for
the
consent
to
a
search
of
that
room
and
of
the
closet
which
she
was
using.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
was
found
in
the
closet
of
the
bedroom
in
a
duffle
bag
hanging
in
the
closet.
not
on
a
duffle
bag
but
a
diaper
bag
and
the
closet
have
men's
and
women's
clothing
in
it
and
it
was
the
bedroom
that
they
jointly
occupied.
and
we've
raised
this
additional
issue
which
the
court
has
recently
addressed
in
the
proposed
federal
rules
of
evidence
in
the
provision
that
we
quote
on
page
28
of
our
brief
and
it's
a
position
that
is
widely
supported
by
the
leading
scholars
in
the
law
of
evidence
as
we
explain
in
this
portion
of
our
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
evidence
is
not
specific
about
the
diaper
bag
itself
in
this
case.
the
evidence
is
that
she
consented
to
a
search
of
the
room
including
the
closet
and
they
found
the
diaper
bag
in
the
closet
to
contain
the
money.
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
about
discussion
of
the
diaper
bag
itself.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that's
our
position,
a
bag
hanging
in
the
closet
that
she
uses
within
the
clear
view
of
her
occupancy.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
now
what
you
say
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
something
else.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
then
there
would
be--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
right.
that
her
occupancy
of
the
room
and
the
closet
gave
her
the
authority
to
open
the
bag
since
it
was
right
there
hanging
in
her
closet.
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
the
closet
that
she
jointly
uses.
it
was
as
much
her
closet
as
it
was
the
duffle
bag
of
the
man
who
gave
the
consent
in
frazier
against
cupp,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
was
the
situation
there.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is
no
proof
on
that,
one
way
of
the
other
about
any
uses
of
that
that
bag
has
been
put
through
in
the
past.
so,
my
point
that
is,
that
she
was
using
it
for
her
child,
otherwise
why
do
they
have
a
diaper
bag?
well,
that
was
its
current
use
but
the
reasonable
inference
is
that
the
lady
with
the
three-year-old
boy
was
the
one
who
would
be
using
the
diaper
bag.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
oh,
the
owner
of
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
they
rented
the
house
mr.
justice,
the
owners
were
settling
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
at
all
about
her
father.
her
mother
was
at
work
and
came
and
was--came
home
later
in
the
afternoon
and
there
was
no
indication
that
anyone
else
was
in
the
house
at
that
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
i
think
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
just
want
to
reinforce
what
has
already
been
said
that
the
courts
have
found
apparent
authority
in
this
case.
on
page
12
(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
of
the
district
court’s
findings
on
which
this
was
based
and
those
findings
right
in
the
middle
of
the
page
include
very
specifically
that
she
told
the
officers
that
the
east
bedroom
was
occupied
by
the
defendant
and
by
her.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i’m
on
page
12
(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
your
honor,
where
we
have
the
district
court’s
opinion
reprinted.
right
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
findings
on
which
the
district
court
based
its
holding
that
there
was
apparent
authority
includes
the
statement
right
in
the
middle
of
page
12
(a).
she
told
the
officers
that
the
east
bedroom
was
occupied
by
the
defendant
and
by
her.”
she
then
consented
to
a
search
of
the
east
bedroom.
she
told
the
officers
that
she
used
the
top
two
drawers
of
the
dresser
in
the
east
bedroom
and
the
defendant
used
the
bottom
two
drawers.
this
was
upheld.
these
findings
were
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
page
3
(a)
of
the
same
appendix
at
the
end
of
the
paragraph
that
ends
at
the
top
of
the
page
3
(a),
that
she
then
told
the
officers
that
she
and
defendant
both
occupied
the
east
bedroom
and
that
the
woman’s
clothing
therein
contained
were
hers.
and,
that
she
told
the
officers
that
she
used
the
two
upper
drawers
of
the
dresser
in
the
room
and
the
defendant
used
the
two
lower
drawers.
without
burdening
the
court
to
read,
all
the
excerpts
in
the
record
which
support
that
i
can
cite
in
the
printed
appendix
to
page
13,
page
15,
page
16,
and
page
18
which
is
testimony
by
each
of
the
three
officers
that
conducted
the
search,
all
supporting
that
she
said
that
this
was
her
bedroom,
that
she
slept
in
the
same
bed
with
the
defendant
there.
now,
there’s
just
one
other
factor
in
response
to
the
question
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
been
asking
about
whether
any
of
the
officers
who
conducted
the
search
knew
who
she
was.
the
only
indication
in
the
record
on
that
does
not
relate
to
her
specifically
but
to
mr.
matlock,
the
respondent
himself.
and,
that
appears
at
a
portion
of
the
transcript
that
was
not
reprinted
in
the
appendix.
on
page
78
of
the
transcript
in
the
course
of
the
interrogation
of
officer
cross
who
was
one
of
the
officers
who
conducted
this
search,
they
asked
him,
“did
you
know
whether
or
not
he
lived
in
that
house?”
and
he
said,
“yes,
sir.”
“how
did
you
know
that?”
“well,
i
had
seen
him
there.
my
father
knew
the
marshall
family
and
through
that,
i
knew
he
was
staying
there.”
that
is
all
that
appears
in
the
record
on
that
subject.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
that’s
all.
