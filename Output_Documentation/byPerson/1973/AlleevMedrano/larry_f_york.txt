mr.
larry
f.
york
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
briefly
summarize
the
facts
of
this
case
and
describe
to
the
court
how
the
case
got
here
in
a
very
brief
fashion.
and
then
to
discuss
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
to
which
you
discussed
and
then
to
discuss
the
intervention
question
of
propriety
or
federal
intervention
--
federal
court
intervention
in
the
case.
in
about
june
of
1966,
intensive
efforts
begin
by
the
afl-cio
in
texas
to
organize
and
unionize
for
the
farmworkers
in
the
rio
grande
valley
of
southern
texas.
those
efforts
were
marked
by
picketing
in
demonstrations
which
went
on
over
a
period
about
13
months
in
june
or
so
1966
up
until
approximately
june
1967.
during
that
period,
the
texas
rangers,
five
of
whom
were
defendants
in
this
case
and
who
are
the
only
defendants
who
have
appealed,
were
called
in
first,
i
believe
the
record
will
show
in
about
november
in
1966
for
the
purpose
apparently
then
of
serving
ten
warrants
on
people
who
had
already
been
charged
with
committing
the
violation
of
having
a
secondary
strike
by
the
local
authorities.
the
ranger
came
in
to
serve
those
ten
warrants.
the
rangers
came
in
to
the
area
again
in
may
of
1967
at
the
request
of
local
officers.
and
from
that
time
until
the
picketing
ended
in
june
of
1967,
about
roughly
six
weeks,
a
two-month
period.
the
rangers
made
several
arrest
in
this
area
obstructing
which
covered
the
number
of
counties.
it
covered
up
a
large
number
of
structures
and
picketers.
the
arrest
made
by
the
defendant
rangers
during
this
approximately
six
week
or
perhaps
shorter
period
in
that,
total
amount
45
including
28
for
mass
picketing
under
texas
statute,
14
for
unlawful
assembly
and
one
for
no
driver’s
license,
one
for
threatening
the
life
of
a
ranger
and
one
for
brandishing
a
weapon
on
the
public
part.
other
arrest
were
major
--
mr.
larry
f.
york
i
believe
it’s
described
as
a
rifle
by
mr.
dimas.
he
is
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case.
a
total
of
--
if
i
read
the
record
correctly
about
70
arrests
of
the
individual
were
made
over
this
13-month
period.
by
both
the
rangers
and
the
local
law
enforcement
officials
in
this
several
county
area
in
which
the
mass
operation
of
organization
was
going
on.
mr.
larry
f.
york
about
70,
your
honor.
its
70
individuals.
mr.
larry
f.
york
i
believe
that
as
stated
in
the
appellees’
brief.
the
total
that
they
come
up
with
is
about
60
arrest
made
in
all
counties
during
this
entire
dispute.
mr.
larry
f.
york
that’s
my
understanding
your
honor
because
i
believe
that’s
what
the
record
show.
mr.
larry
f.
york
swell,
they
were
about
all
this
60
or
70
of
sure
arrest,
they
were
all
with
one
or
two
exceptions,
the
driver’s
license
and
the
brandishing
of
weapon
that
is
all
involved
the
statute
which
is
before
this
court
and
which
before
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes
sir,
that’s
correct.
mr.
larry
f.
york
oh!
i’m
sorry.
mr.
larry
f.
york
no,
we’re
not
saying
that
that’s
all
of
the
arrest
that
they
were
ever
during
that
county,
during
this
--
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
f.
york
i
believe
that
they
were
arrest
under
that
section.
mr.
larry
f.
york
your
honor,
i’m
not
sure
that
i
can
answer
that
question
without
referring
to
the
record.
mr.
larry
f.
york
alright.
mr.
larry
f.
york
i
will
hope
to
touch
that
in
rebuttal,
if
i
may,
your
honor.
the
arrest
we
talked
about
ended
in
a
period
in
about
june
of
1961.
this
period
of
13
months
or
so
was
marked
by
actual
vandalism
as
the
record
show
directed
toward
farm
owners
in
the
sense
of
finding
sugar
in
gas
tanks,
punctured
tractor
tires,
stolen
generator
and
that
kind
of
thing.
the
three-judge
court
found
that
the
law
for
including
the
ranger
defendants
had
acted
unlawful
towards
the
strikers
by
harassing
them
and
intimidating
them
for
the
purpose
of
ending
the
strike.
in
june
of
1967,
state
civil
injunctive
proceeding
was
filed
in
the
state
district
court
of
starr
county;
one
of
the
counties
involved
in
a
case
filed
la
casita
farms
versus
afl-cio
organizing
committee.
an
injunction
relating
to
la
casita
farm
was
rendered
by
the
court
in
july
of
1967,
enjoining
all
picketing
against
la
casita,
which
was
one
of
the
major
employee
in
the
area.
on
the
basis
that
the
picketing
were
shown
to
be
so
intertwine
with
violence
and
disruption
that
it
passed
any
legitimate
form
of
communications
so
that
all
picketers
was
enjoined
of
la
casita
farm.
the
union
appealed
the
injunction
to
the
court
of
civil
appeal
to
texas
and
trial
court
was
affirmed
in
that
reporting
to
439
s.
w.
2d
398.
and
that
of
course
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
that
is
another
injunction
and
that
is
what
we
say
that
the
record
shows
ended
the
strike
in
the
area.
it
was
a
fact
that
there
was
a
state
injunction
in
june
of
1967.
then
in
july
of
1967
thereby
plaintiff
filed
this
action
with
the
result
that
we
know
of
in
the
three-judge
court
were
here
today.
i’d
like
--
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
f.
york
it
was
appealed
to
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals
which
i
--
mr.
larry
f.
york
your
honor,
i
can’t
tell
you
precisely
the
injunction
was
entered
on
july
11,
1967.
this
case
was
filed,
i
don’t
have
the
precise
date
but
it
was
filed
i
believe
in
july
of
1967.
ordinarily
that
would
mean
that
the
appeal
could
not
have
been
completed
by
that
time.
mr.
larry
f.
york
it
was
in
1968
and
--
mr.
larry
f.
york
i’m
sorry
--
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes
sir,
it
became
the
court’s
opinion
with
december
31,
1968
and
there
was
--
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
f.
york
no,
sir.
the
texas
court
civil
appeals
desire
an
immediate
court.
the
record
does
not
reflect
there
was
a
reattempt
made
to
appeal
from
that
court
by
the
union
to
our
texas
supreme
court.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes,
sir.
it
may
or
may
not
be
taken
but
the
record
will
reflect
order
an
attempt
that
has
been
made.
section
5154d
of
our
statute
involving
mass
picketing.
that’s
what
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
you
this
time.
texas
is
one
of
--
in
support
our
research
has
been
able
to
develop
one
of
only
three
states
all
over
--
perhaps
all
who
have
adopted
a
specific
statute
defining
what
mass
picketing
is.
however,
the
equity
courts
of
this
land
have
recognized
for
a
long
time
that
the
concept
of
picketing
while
that
it
involves
speech,
also
involves
conduct
and
that
the
conduct
side
of
it
may
be
regulated
in
the
absence
of
statute
so
that
the
concept
of
mass
picketing,
picketing
which
transcends
the
speech
elements
of
communication
and
moves
into
the
conduct
area
may
be
by
the
courts
and
the
variety
of
cases
in
many
jurisdiction
cited
in
our
brief
in
new
york
and
new
jersey
and
ohio
with
a
number
of
pickets
has
been
specific
and
limited
by
the
equity
court
in
an
injunctive
process.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes
although
we
would
say
your
honor
that
it
would
not
be
limited
to
violence.
it
might
be
and
has
been
shown
in
it’s
situation
for
that
many
showing
of
simple
blockage
of
the
reasonable
right
to
ingress
and
egress.
or
other
forms
of
conduct,
shorter
violence
which
are
thought
to
be
violative
of
a
valid
state
part.
mr.
larry
f.
york
your
honor,
but
if
our
research
is
correct,
in
the
state
of
nebraska
had
a
statute
which
is
almost
identical
to
the
texas
statute
to
the
point
of
talking
in
terms
of
50
feet
and
it’s
almost
the
twin
of
our
texas
statute.
state
of
south
dakota
had
a
different
sort
of
statute
which
talks
in
terms
of
the
number
of
picketers
being
limited
to
5%
of
the
first
100
strikers
and
1%
thereafter.
i
believe
it’s
the
south
dakota
scheme.
the
cases
from
other
jurisdictions
are
numerous
on
the
point
of
the
injunctive
relief
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
mr.
larry
f.
york
we’re
also
aware
of
this
court’s
ruling
in
the
vogt
case
in
1957
which
establishes
the
principle
that
picketing
even
peaceful
picketing.
even
clearly
peaceful
picketing
may
be
regulated
by
the
state
recognizing
that
a
part
of
picketing
is
conduct.
i
the
picketing
as
in
the
vogt
case
has
added
primary
purpose,
the
violation
of
a
particular
state
policy
which
is
a
valid
state
policy.
so
the
background
for
regulation
of
picketing
is
found
both
in
the
common
law
notions
and
the
various
equity
court
notions
of
injunction
and
in
this
courts
ruling
in
vogt
case
and
what
texas
has
done
is
simply
to
adopt
a
statutory
scheme
to
in
fact
codify
the
doctrines
of
independent
expressed
in
the
other
courts
of
what
mass
picketing
amounts
to.
the
texas
statute
is
limited
to
the
labor
context.
we
don’t
contend
and
the
statute
can’t
be
read,
we
submit
just
to
apply
any
other
kind
of
picketing.
indeed,
the
afl-cio
in
there
amicus
brief
at
page
2
concedes
that
was
aimed
at
labor
unions.
the
preamble
to
the
statute
states
clearly
that
when
the
statute
was
passed
in
1949,
it
was
stated
by
the
legislature
that
it
was
a
matter
of
public
knowledge
that
picketing
is
exercised
by
labor
organizations.
it’s
not
used
only
as
a
means
of
expressions
of
ideas
to
the
public
generally
but
likewise
as
a
means
of
coercion
to
the
mere
present
to
the
picket
lines,
etcetera.
this
appears
in
the
preamble
of
the
statute.
statute
by
it’s
time
is
limited
to
picketing
by
organizations.
the
statute
has
never
been
applied
otherwise
in
texas
except
in
the
labor
picketing
context.
it’s
located
in
the
labor
section
of
our
statute
and
applies
to
nothing
else.
the
court
below,
the
three-judge
court
stated
that
one
need
only
look
at
the
davis
versus
francois
case
out
of
the
fifth
circuit
to
determine
that
our
statute
was
unconstitutional.
but
in
the
davis
case,
the
louisiana
ordinance
that
was
attacked
said
that
you
cannot
have
more
than
two
pickets,
period,
the
end.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes.
mr.
larry
f.
york
well
they
have
--
there
can’t
be
no
more
than
twp
pickets
within
50
feet.
mr.
larry
f.
york
there
can
be
two
pickets
if
you
can
visualize
those,
there
could
be
two
pickets
at
that
door
but
there
could
be
no
more
than
two
within
50
feet
of
the
door.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes
sir.
that’s
correct.
mr.
larry
f.
york
well
the
two
--
right.
two
pickets
may
be
(voice
overlap).
mr.
larry
f.
york
and
the
next
two
–
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes,
sir.
that’s
correct.
you
can
envision
a
city
block.
we
assume
it
to
be
300
feet
on
the
side
1200-foot
parameter.
it
depends
somewhat
on
where
the
doors
are
located
but
the
number
of
pickets
you
much
around
that
block
under
our
statute
would
be
somewhere
between
40
and
50
and
between
40
and
48.
the
object
as
we
perceive
it,
a
picketing
is
to
communicate
and
it’s
impossible
for
us
to
see
under
the
cases
and
under
our
statute
how
there
is
any
infringement
on
the
right
to
communicate
under
our
statute.
there
are
no
evidence
submitted.
it’s
not
even
suggested
in
the
brief
or
in
the
record
by
the
appellees
that
their
right
to
communicate
their
dispute
in
the
rio
grande
valley
of
texas
was
in
any
fashion
inhibited
by
the
statute.
indeed,
everybody
in
the
valley
knew
the
dispute
and
in
the
normal
labor
context,
the
simple
--
one
simple
saying
and
it’s
enough
to
advice
the
public
or
to
advice
other
unions
etcetera
that
there
is
labor
dispute,
your
honor.
after
being
further
conduct
about
harassing
type,
the
fairer
brief
which
is
one
of
the
amicus
brief
filed
indicates
that
their
particular
plant
can
have
as
many
as
a
hundred
pickets
around
it
and
follow
within
the
coverage
of
the
texas
statute
and
you
can
conceive
a
plant
that
might
have
hundred
of
pickets
around
them
and
still
be
entirely
legal
within
the
meaning
of
the
texas
statute.
mr.
larry
f.
york
i
don’t
think
your
honor
that
it
would
be
limited
to
frontage.
if
the
building
was
49
feet
around,
it
might
well
be
limited
two
pickets
for
that
building.
mr.
larry
f.
york
i
think
in
that
case
that
it
would
be
limited
to
two
pickets.
the
obstruction
portion
of
the
statute
as
the
statute
has
two
parts.
one
is
to
describe
mass
picketing
in
terms
of
the
50-feet
rule.
the
second
part
is
to
talk
in
terms
of
forming
an
obstacle
to
free
ingress
and
egress
from
any
entrance
either
by
obstructing
said
free
ingress
and
egress
about
person
or
by
placing
a
vehicle
or
other
obstruction
there.
our
texas
code
in
the
geisler
case
which
is
mentioned
both
on
the
three-judge
court
opinion
and
then
our
brief,
held
that
the
obstruction
talked
about,
meant
only
a
physical
obstruction
not
any
other
kind
of
obstruction.
it
was
suggested
in
the
geisler
case
for
instance
that
holding
of
a
particular
type
sign
or
flag
might
well
keep
people
out
and
the
court
said,
no
that
won’t
get
it,
it
has
to
be
a
physical
obstruction.
if
i
can
tell
people
to
choose
not
to
cross
a
picket
line,
it
is
just
one
of
the
accepted
parallels
of
picketing
that
we
are
not
going
to
enjoin
that.
the
cameron
versus
johnson
with
mr.
justice
brennan
lately
approved
a
mississippi
statute.
we
say
is
totally
just
positive
of
our
case.
mississippi
statute
talked
about
picketing
in
such
a
manner
as
to
obstruct
or
unreasonable
interfere
with
being
ingress
and
egress.
it
is
in
the
subjunctive
that
is
it
is
or
so
the
mississippi
statute
can
be
read
to
say
that
you
may
not
obstruct
pre
ingress
and
egress.
our
statute
says
you
may
not
obstruct
before
you
ingress
and
egress.
the
court
in
cameron
stated
that
the
time
obstruct
plainly
required
no
guessing
as
to
its
meaning
that
we
agree.
the
plaintiffs
or
the
appellees
here
when
they
submitted
there
final
proposed,
revised
judgment
to
the
court
below
in
this
case
did
not
include
the
obstruction
portion,
the
second
portion
of
54d
in
their
proposed
finding
and
relief
and
did
not
in
that
context
asked
the
court
below
to
find
the
obstruction
portion
of
54d
unconstitutional.
the
three-judge
court
in
a
latter
part
of
its
opinion
in
finding
article
784
of
our
texas
statutes
to
be
constitutional
and
that
statute
says
whoever
shall
willfully
obstruct
or
injure
our
pose
to
be
obstructed.
the
court
there
construed
the
word
obstruct
to
mean
actual
prevention
or
a
substantial
interference
who
track
them.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes
sir
that’s
correct.
and
we
say
that
when
you
read
the
cameron
statute
side
by
side
with
errors
and
read
the
meaning
of
the
word
obstruct
in
it
with
our
conclusion
then
statement
of
ours
is
all
right
under
cameron
versus
johnson.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
f.
york
your
honor,
i
don’t
believe
by
reading
it
that
it
did
not,
it
maybe
said
because
some
--
mr.
larry
f.
york
well,
we
would
not
suggest
that
to
the
federal
officials
your
honor
and
wouldn’t
suggest
that
that
be
done
under
the
time
of
this
judgment.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
don’t
believe
the
prosecutions
have
been
followed
because
of
this
case.
mr.
larry
f.
york
as
a
practical
matter,
it’s
been
so
treated.
although
i
don’t
think
you
can
read
the
precise
language
of
the
judgment
and
find
that
in
it.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes
sir,
extremely.
i’d
like
to
touch
very
briefly
on
the
question
of
equal
protection
under
our
54d
statute
which
applies
to
labor
organizations
and
does
not
by
its
term
applied
to
other
organizations.
were
where
mr.
justice
marshall’s
decision
to
moseley
as
the
courts
aware
there
were
statute
in
chicago
which
held
that
they
stated
that
had
to
be
no
demonstrations
around
a
public
school
within
a
150
feet
of
that
public
school
except
that
labor
disputes
were
not
so
enjoined
or
so
restricted.
this
court
found
that
to
be
a
violation
of
equal
protection
clause.
we
would
submit
your
honors
that
our
case
differs
from
that
and
serve
with
important
respects
for
one
the
restriction
that
is
imposed
by
our
statute
as
it
intersects
with
first
amendment
rights
is
a
valid
and
legal
restriction.
i
thank
the
court
even
though
decided
mostly
on
equal
protection
grounds,
seem
to
have
on
its
mind
some
what
the
concept
that
is
was
difficult
or
shouldn’t
briefly
allowed
to
enjoin
the
kind
of
public
issue
picketing
that
was
prohibited
by
the
statute
in
the
chicago
case,
the
moseley
case.
i
urge
as
we
stated
before
is
a
reasonable
restriction
on
the
rights.
the
other
and
perhaps
more
important
station
i
think
is
that
in
moseley
the
court
was
confronted
with
the
situation
where
of
the
entire
universe
of
picketing.
a
small
area
that
is
labor
picketing
had
been
singled
out
and
not
regulated
being
the
risk
of
the
universe
had
been
assumed
to
be
bad
and
regulated
by
the
statutes.
in
our
situation
we
have
the
flip
part
of
that,
we
have
the
entire
universe
picketing
all
unregulated
by
our
statute
except
the
narrow
portion
of
the
labor
picketing
which
is
regulated
for
the
reason
set
out
in
the
preamble
of
our
statute.
and
we
say
that
in
that
sense
we
have
made
a
reasonable
classification
and
that
the
equal
protection
statements
made
in
the
moseley
case
do
not
apply
to
this
case.
additionally,
in
that
regard
we’ve
mentioned
to
the
court
that
there
was
no
suggestion
made,
no
proof
made
of
any
arbitrariness
in
this
statute
by
the
plaintiffs
as
they
tried
the
case.
i
would
if
i
may
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes
sir.
i
like
just
few
moment.
i
would
like
to
say
that
in
answer
to
justice
rehnquist
question
earlier
and
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question
and
we
find
no
one
less
than
any
of
the
names
like
were
ever
charged
with
violation
under
418.
the
united
farm
worker
versus
la
casita
case
was
affirmed
by
the
texas
court
civil
appeals.
i
would
also
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
preamble
that
we
discussed
earlier
in
my
remarks
is
not,
i
don’t
believe
in
the
briefs
unless
it
appears
preamble
to
54d
it
does
appear
in
the
official
reported
version
of
the
texas
statutes
and
its
available
there
for
the
court
but
i’m
not
certainly
available
in
the
briefs.
we
believe
that
there
has
to
be
a
showing
of
a
general
pattern
for
each
particular
statute
before
the
kind
of
federal
court
intervention
talk
to
appear
is
proper.
we
don’t
believe
that
a
pattern
which
just
talked
generally
of
what
happened
under
a
lot
of
statutes
is
sufficient.
for
instance,
under
54d
the
54
under
obstruction
statute,
evidence
is
that
there
were
only
about
25
arrests
for
that
in
the
briefs
spoken
out
by
mr.
dixie
when
the
ranger
was
there
after
may
11.
the
first
thing
that
captain
allee
did
is
shown
in
mr.
dixie’s
brief
was
to
go
out
and
tell
the
people
to
get
50
feet
apart
which
they
did.
a
week
later,
he
came
back
and
they
were
not
50
feet
apart.
they
are
bunched
up
in
a
bunch
and
arrests
were
made
and
arrests
were
made
on
couple
of
other
occasions
under
circumstances
which
were
clearly
violative
of
the
texas
act.
there
is
no
statement
made
in
the
briefs
and
in
the
record
that
there
was
any
violence
that
i’m
aware
of
it
attached
to
those
arrests
under
54d.
we
say
that
there
can’t
be
an
injunction
whether
the
statutes
be
held
constitutional
but
the
--
under
the
theory
of
saying
perhaps
that
they
might
be
enjoined
because
it
was
a
bad
faith
prosecution
with
no
reasonable
hope
of
conviction.
that’s
clear
enough
to
case
here.
these
statutes
are
facially
valid.
picket
as
we
have
discussed
54d
and
some
detail
with
the
court,
less
the
court
to
so
find
it
and
to
so
find
it
facially
valid.
mr.
larry
f.
york
your
honor,
we
don’t
agree
with
all
of
some
what
we
might
call
editorializing
but
as
far
as
the
findings
of
fact
can
say
they
were
largely
undisputed
and
we
have
no
particularly
quarrel
with
the
facts.
we
may
disagree
with
some
of
the
conclusions
or
statements
made
by
the
court
about
what
the
fact
show
that
is
their
conclusions
for
more
or
less
undisputed
facts.
but
before
as
their
conclusion
about
what
the
facts
themselves
were,
we
have
a
not
particular
disagreement
with
that
and
have
not
urged
it
upon
this
court.
mr.
larry
f.
york
well,
that’s
the
part
of
it
that
we
did
challenge
in
the
sense
of
talking
about
the
conclusions
that
they
raise
it
from.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
f.
york
the
standard
of
review
is
far
as
--
mr.
larry
f.
york
i
think
in
that
area
that
is
not
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
in
the
sense
of
findings
of
fact
but
it’s
an
area
of
simply
discussing
the
case
isn’t
trying
to
determine
whether
under
the
case
is
lift
particular
--
mr.
larry
f.
york
i
believe
it
is.
i
like
the
bad
faith
aspect
covered
in
that
sense
is
wrong
question
your
honor.
mr.
larry
f.
york
well,
as
a
conclusion
from
these
facts,
whether
it’s
sufficient
under
the
younger
cases.
mr.
larry
f.
york
well
it’s
a
mixed
law
and
fact
question.
mr.
larry
f.
york
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
briefly
summarize
the
facts
of
this
case
and
describe
to
the
court
how
the
case
got
here
in
a
very
brief
fashion.
and
then
to
discuss
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
to
which
you
discussed
and
then
to
discuss
the
intervention
question
of
propriety
or
federal
intervention
--
federal
court
intervention
in
the
case.
in
about
june
of
1966,
intensive
efforts
begin
by
the
afl-cio
in
texas
to
organize
and
unionize
for
the
farmworkers
in
the
rio
grande
valley
of
southern
texas.
those
efforts
were
marked
by
picketing
in
demonstrations
which
went
on
over
a
period
about
13
months
in
june
or
so
1966
up
until
approximately
june
1967.
during
that
period,
the
texas
rangers,
five
of
whom
were
defendants
in
this
case
and
who
are
the
only
defendants
who
have
appealed,
were
called
in
first,
i
believe
the
record
will
show
in
about
november
in
1966
for
the
purpose
apparently
then
of
serving
ten
warrants
on
people
who
had
already
been
charged
with
committing
the
violation
of
having
a
secondary
strike
by
the
local
authorities.
the
ranger
came
in
to
serve
those
ten
warrants.
the
rangers
came
in
to
the
area
again
in
may
of
1967
at
the
request
of
local
officers.
and
from
that
time
until
the
picketing
ended
in
june
of
1967,
about
roughly
six
weeks,
a
two-month
period.
the
rangers
made
several
arrest
in
this
area
obstructing
which
covered
the
number
of
counties.
it
covered
up
a
large
number
of
structures
and
picketers.
the
arrest
made
by
the
defendant
rangers
during
this
approximately
six
week
or
perhaps
shorter
period
in
that,
total
amount
45
including
28
for
mass
picketing
under
texas
statute,
14
for
unlawful
assembly
and
one
for
no
driver’s
license,
one
for
threatening
the
life
of
a
ranger
and
one
for
brandishing
a
weapon
on
the
public
part.
other
arrest
were
major
--
mr.
larry
f.
york
i
believe
it’s
described
as
a
rifle
by
mr.
dimas.
he
is
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case.
a
total
of
--
if
i
read
the
record
correctly
about
70
arrests
of
the
individual
were
made
over
this
13-month
period.
by
both
the
rangers
and
the
local
law
enforcement
officials
in
this
several
county
area
in
which
the
mass
operation
of
organization
was
going
on.
mr.
larry
f.
york
about
70,
your
honor.
its
70
individuals.
mr.
larry
f.
york
i
believe
that
as
stated
in
the
appellees’
brief.
the
total
that
they
come
up
with
is
about
60
arrest
made
in
all
counties
during
this
entire
dispute.
mr.
larry
f.
york
that’s
my
understanding
your
honor
because
i
believe
that’s
what
the
record
show.
mr.
larry
f.
york
swell,
they
were
about
all
this
60
or
70
of
sure
arrest,
they
were
all
with
one
or
two
exceptions,
the
driver’s
license
and
the
brandishing
of
weapon
that
is
all
involved
the
statute
which
is
before
this
court
and
which
before
the
three-judge
court.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes
sir,
that’s
correct.
mr.
larry
f.
york
oh!
i’m
sorry.
mr.
larry
f.
york
no,
we’re
not
saying
that
that’s
all
of
the
arrest
that
they
were
ever
during
that
county,
during
this
--
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
f.
york
i
believe
that
they
were
arrest
under
that
section.
mr.
larry
f.
york
your
honor,
i’m
not
sure
that
i
can
answer
that
question
without
referring
to
the
record.
mr.
larry
f.
york
alright.
mr.
larry
f.
york
i
will
hope
to
touch
that
in
rebuttal,
if
i
may,
your
honor.
the
arrest
we
talked
about
ended
in
a
period
in
about
june
of
1961.
this
period
of
13
months
or
so
was
marked
by
actual
vandalism
as
the
record
show
directed
toward
farm
owners
in
the
sense
of
finding
sugar
in
gas
tanks,
punctured
tractor
tires,
stolen
generator
and
that
kind
of
thing.
the
three-judge
court
found
that
the
law
for
including
the
ranger
defendants
had
acted
unlawful
towards
the
strikers
by
harassing
them
and
intimidating
them
for
the
purpose
of
ending
the
strike.
in
june
of
1967,
state
civil
injunctive
proceeding
was
filed
in
the
state
district
court
of
starr
county;
one
of
the
counties
involved
in
a
case
filed
la
casita
farms
versus
afl-cio
organizing
committee.
an
injunction
relating
to
la
casita
farm
was
rendered
by
the
court
in
july
of
1967,
enjoining
all
picketing
against
la
casita,
which
was
one
of
the
major
employee
in
the
area.
on
the
basis
that
the
picketing
were
shown
to
be
so
intertwine
with
violence
and
disruption
that
it
passed
any
legitimate
form
of
communications
so
that
all
picketers
was
enjoined
of
la
casita
farm.
the
union
appealed
the
injunction
to
the
court
of
civil
appeal
to
texas
and
trial
court
was
affirmed
in
that
reporting
to
439
s.
w.
2d
398.
and
that
of
course
is
not
involved
in
this
case,
that
is
another
injunction
and
that
is
what
we
say
that
the
record
shows
ended
the
strike
in
the
area.
it
was
a
fact
that
there
was
a
state
injunction
in
june
of
1967.
then
in
july
of
1967
thereby
plaintiff
filed
this
action
with
the
result
that
we
know
of
in
the
three-judge
court
were
here
today.
i’d
like
--
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
f.
york
it
was
appealed
to
the
texas
court
of
civil
appeals
which
i
--
mr.
larry
f.
york
your
honor,
i
can’t
tell
you
precisely
the
injunction
was
entered
on
july
11,
1967.
this
case
was
filed,
i
don’t
have
the
precise
date
but
it
was
filed
i
believe
in
july
of
1967.
ordinarily
that
would
mean
that
the
appeal
could
not
have
been
completed
by
that
time.
mr.
larry
f.
york
it
was
in
1968
and
--
mr.
larry
f.
york
i’m
sorry
--
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes
sir,
it
became
the
court’s
opinion
with
december
31,
1968
and
there
was
--
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
f.
york
no,
sir.
the
texas
court
civil
appeals
desire
an
immediate
court.
the
record
does
not
reflect
there
was
a
reattempt
made
to
appeal
from
that
court
by
the
union
to
our
texas
supreme
court.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes,
sir.
it
may
or
may
not
be
taken
but
the
record
will
reflect
order
an
attempt
that
has
been
made.
section
5154d
of
our
statute
involving
mass
picketing.
that’s
what
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
you
this
time.
texas
is
one
of
--
in
support
our
research
has
been
able
to
develop
one
of
only
three
states
all
over
--
perhaps
all
who
have
adopted
a
specific
statute
defining
what
mass
picketing
is.
however,
the
equity
courts
of
this
land
have
recognized
for
a
long
time
that
the
concept
of
picketing
while
that
it
involves
speech,
also
involves
conduct
and
that
the
conduct
side
of
it
may
be
regulated
in
the
absence
of
statute
so
that
the
concept
of
mass
picketing,
picketing
which
transcends
the
speech
elements
of
communication
and
moves
into
the
conduct
area
may
be
by
the
courts
and
the
variety
of
cases
in
many
jurisdiction
cited
in
our
brief
in
new
york
and
new
jersey
and
ohio
with
a
number
of
pickets
has
been
specific
and
limited
by
the
equity
court
in
an
injunctive
process.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes
although
we
would
say
your
honor
that
it
would
not
be
limited
to
violence.
it
might
be
and
has
been
shown
in
it’s
situation
for
that
many
showing
of
simple
blockage
of
the
reasonable
right
to
ingress
and
egress.
or
other
forms
of
conduct,
shorter
violence
which
are
thought
to
be
violative
of
a
valid
state
part.
mr.
larry
f.
york
your
honor,
but
if
our
research
is
correct,
in
the
state
of
nebraska
had
a
statute
which
is
almost
identical
to
the
texas
statute
to
the
point
of
talking
in
terms
of
50
feet
and
it’s
almost
the
twin
of
our
texas
statute.
state
of
south
dakota
had
a
different
sort
of
statute
which
talks
in
terms
of
the
number
of
picketers
being
limited
to
5%
of
the
first
100
strikers
and
1%
thereafter.
i
believe
it’s
the
south
dakota
scheme.
the
cases
from
other
jurisdictions
are
numerous
on
the
point
of
the
injunctive
relief
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
mr.
larry
f.
york
we’re
also
aware
of
this
court’s
ruling
in
the
vogt
case
in
1957
which
establishes
the
principle
that
picketing
even
peaceful
picketing.
even
clearly
peaceful
picketing
may
be
regulated
by
the
state
recognizing
that
a
part
of
picketing
is
conduct.
i
the
picketing
as
in
the
vogt
case
has
added
primary
purpose,
the
violation
of
a
particular
state
policy
which
is
a
valid
state
policy.
so
the
background
for
regulation
of
picketing
is
found
both
in
the
common
law
notions
and
the
various
equity
court
notions
of
injunction
and
in
this
courts
ruling
in
vogt
case
and
what
texas
has
done
is
simply
to
adopt
a
statutory
scheme
to
in
fact
codify
the
doctrines
of
independent
expressed
in
the
other
courts
of
what
mass
picketing
amounts
to.
the
texas
statute
is
limited
to
the
labor
context.
we
don’t
contend
and
the
statute
can’t
be
read,
we
submit
just
to
apply
any
other
kind
of
picketing.
indeed,
the
afl-cio
in
there
amicus
brief
at
page
2
concedes
that
was
aimed
at
labor
unions.
the
preamble
to
the
statute
states
clearly
that
when
the
statute
was
passed
in
1949,
it
was
stated
by
the
legislature
that
it
was
a
matter
of
public
knowledge
that
picketing
is
exercised
by
labor
organizations.
it’s
not
used
only
as
a
means
of
expressions
of
ideas
to
the
public
generally
but
likewise
as
a
means
of
coercion
to
the
mere
present
to
the
picket
lines,
etcetera.
this
appears
in
the
preamble
of
the
statute.
statute
by
it’s
time
is
limited
to
picketing
by
organizations.
the
statute
has
never
been
applied
otherwise
in
texas
except
in
the
labor
picketing
context.
it’s
located
in
the
labor
section
of
our
statute
and
applies
to
nothing
else.
the
court
below,
the
three-judge
court
stated
that
one
need
only
look
at
the
davis
versus
francois
case
out
of
the
fifth
circuit
to
determine
that
our
statute
was
unconstitutional.
but
in
the
davis
case,
the
louisiana
ordinance
that
was
attacked
said
that
you
cannot
have
more
than
two
pickets,
period,
the
end.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes.
mr.
larry
f.
york
well
they
have
--
there
can’t
be
no
more
than
twp
pickets
within
50
feet.
mr.
larry
f.
york
there
can
be
two
pickets
if
you
can
visualize
those,
there
could
be
two
pickets
at
that
door
but
there
could
be
no
more
than
two
within
50
feet
of
the
door.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes
sir.
that’s
correct.
mr.
larry
f.
york
well
the
two
--
right.
two
pickets
may
be
(voice
overlap).
mr.
larry
f.
york
and
the
next
two
–
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes,
sir.
that’s
correct.
you
can
envision
a
city
block.
we
assume
it
to
be
300
feet
on
the
side
1200-foot
parameter.
it
depends
somewhat
on
where
the
doors
are
located
but
the
number
of
pickets
you
much
around
that
block
under
our
statute
would
be
somewhere
between
40
and
50
and
between
40
and
48.
the
object
as
we
perceive
it,
a
picketing
is
to
communicate
and
it’s
impossible
for
us
to
see
under
the
cases
and
under
our
statute
how
there
is
any
infringement
on
the
right
to
communicate
under
our
statute.
there
are
no
evidence
submitted.
it’s
not
even
suggested
in
the
brief
or
in
the
record
by
the
appellees
that
their
right
to
communicate
their
dispute
in
the
rio
grande
valley
of
texas
was
in
any
fashion
inhibited
by
the
statute.
indeed,
everybody
in
the
valley
knew
the
dispute
and
in
the
normal
labor
context,
the
simple
--
one
simple
saying
and
it’s
enough
to
advice
the
public
or
to
advice
other
unions
etcetera
that
there
is
labor
dispute,
your
honor.
after
being
further
conduct
about
harassing
type,
the
fairer
brief
which
is
one
of
the
amicus
brief
filed
indicates
that
their
particular
plant
can
have
as
many
as
a
hundred
pickets
around
it
and
follow
within
the
coverage
of
the
texas
statute
and
you
can
conceive
a
plant
that
might
have
hundred
of
pickets
around
them
and
still
be
entirely
legal
within
the
meaning
of
the
texas
statute.
mr.
larry
f.
york
i
don’t
think
your
honor
that
it
would
be
limited
to
frontage.
if
the
building
was
49
feet
around,
it
might
well
be
limited
two
pickets
for
that
building.
mr.
larry
f.
york
i
think
in
that
case
that
it
would
be
limited
to
two
pickets.
the
obstruction
portion
of
the
statute
as
the
statute
has
two
parts.
one
is
to
describe
mass
picketing
in
terms
of
the
50-feet
rule.
the
second
part
is
to
talk
in
terms
of
forming
an
obstacle
to
free
ingress
and
egress
from
any
entrance
either
by
obstructing
said
free
ingress
and
egress
about
person
or
by
placing
a
vehicle
or
other
obstruction
there.
our
texas
code
in
the
geisler
case
which
is
mentioned
both
on
the
three-judge
court
opinion
and
then
our
brief,
held
that
the
obstruction
talked
about,
meant
only
a
physical
obstruction
not
any
other
kind
of
obstruction.
it
was
suggested
in
the
geisler
case
for
instance
that
holding
of
a
particular
type
sign
or
flag
might
well
keep
people
out
and
the
court
said,
no
that
won’t
get
it,
it
has
to
be
a
physical
obstruction.
if
i
can
tell
people
to
choose
not
to
cross
a
picket
line,
it
is
just
one
of
the
accepted
parallels
of
picketing
that
we
are
not
going
to
enjoin
that.
the
cameron
versus
johnson
with
mr.
justice
brennan
lately
approved
a
mississippi
statute.
we
say
is
totally
just
positive
of
our
case.
mississippi
statute
talked
about
picketing
in
such
a
manner
as
to
obstruct
or
unreasonable
interfere
with
being
ingress
and
egress.
it
is
in
the
subjunctive
that
is
it
is
or
so
the
mississippi
statute
can
be
read
to
say
that
you
may
not
obstruct
pre
ingress
and
egress.
our
statute
says
you
may
not
obstruct
before
you
ingress
and
egress.
the
court
in
cameron
stated
that
the
time
obstruct
plainly
required
no
guessing
as
to
its
meaning
that
we
agree.
the
plaintiffs
or
the
appellees
here
when
they
submitted
there
final
proposed,
revised
judgment
to
the
court
below
in
this
case
did
not
include
the
obstruction
portion,
the
second
portion
of
54d
in
their
proposed
finding
and
relief
and
did
not
in
that
context
asked
the
court
below
to
find
the
obstruction
portion
of
54d
unconstitutional.
the
three-judge
court
in
a
latter
part
of
its
opinion
in
finding
article
784
of
our
texas
statutes
to
be
constitutional
and
that
statute
says
whoever
shall
willfully
obstruct
or
injure
our
pose
to
be
obstructed.
the
court
there
construed
the
word
obstruct
to
mean
actual
prevention
or
a
substantial
interference
who
track
them.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes
sir
that’s
correct.
and
we
say
that
when
you
read
the
cameron
statute
side
by
side
with
errors
and
read
the
meaning
of
the
word
obstruct
in
it
with
our
conclusion
then
statement
of
ours
is
all
right
under
cameron
versus
johnson.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
f.
york
your
honor,
i
don’t
believe
by
reading
it
that
it
did
not,
it
maybe
said
because
some
--
mr.
larry
f.
york
well,
we
would
not
suggest
that
to
the
federal
officials
your
honor
and
wouldn’t
suggest
that
that
be
done
under
the
time
of
this
judgment.
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
don’t
believe
the
prosecutions
have
been
followed
because
of
this
case.
mr.
larry
f.
york
as
a
practical
matter,
it’s
been
so
treated.
although
i
don’t
think
you
can
read
the
precise
language
of
the
judgment
and
find
that
in
it.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes
sir,
extremely.
i’d
like
to
touch
very
briefly
on
the
question
of
equal
protection
under
our
54d
statute
which
applies
to
labor
organizations
and
does
not
by
its
term
applied
to
other
organizations.
were
where
mr.
justice
marshall’s
decision
to
moseley
as
the
courts
aware
there
were
statute
in
chicago
which
held
that
they
stated
that
had
to
be
no
demonstrations
around
a
public
school
within
a
150
feet
of
that
public
school
except
that
labor
disputes
were
not
so
enjoined
or
so
restricted.
this
court
found
that
to
be
a
violation
of
equal
protection
clause.
we
would
submit
your
honors
that
our
case
differs
from
that
and
serve
with
important
respects
for
one
the
restriction
that
is
imposed
by
our
statute
as
it
intersects
with
first
amendment
rights
is
a
valid
and
legal
restriction.
i
thank
the
court
even
though
decided
mostly
on
equal
protection
grounds,
seem
to
have
on
its
mind
some
what
the
concept
that
is
was
difficult
or
shouldn’t
briefly
allowed
to
enjoin
the
kind
of
public
issue
picketing
that
was
prohibited
by
the
statute
in
the
chicago
case,
the
moseley
case.
i
urge
as
we
stated
before
is
a
reasonable
restriction
on
the
rights.
the
other
and
perhaps
more
important
station
i
think
is
that
in
moseley
the
court
was
confronted
with
the
situation
where
of
the
entire
universe
of
picketing.
a
small
area
that
is
labor
picketing
had
been
singled
out
and
not
regulated
being
the
risk
of
the
universe
had
been
assumed
to
be
bad
and
regulated
by
the
statutes.
in
our
situation
we
have
the
flip
part
of
that,
we
have
the
entire
universe
picketing
all
unregulated
by
our
statute
except
the
narrow
portion
of
the
labor
picketing
which
is
regulated
for
the
reason
set
out
in
the
preamble
of
our
statute.
and
we
say
that
in
that
sense
we
have
made
a
reasonable
classification
and
that
the
equal
protection
statements
made
in
the
moseley
case
do
not
apply
to
this
case.
additionally,
in
that
regard
we’ve
mentioned
to
the
court
that
there
was
no
suggestion
made,
no
proof
made
of
any
arbitrariness
in
this
statute
by
the
plaintiffs
as
they
tried
the
case.
i
would
if
i
may
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes
sir.
i
like
just
few
moment.
i
would
like
to
say
that
in
answer
to
justice
rehnquist
question
earlier
and
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question
and
we
find
no
one
less
than
any
of
the
names
like
were
ever
charged
with
violation
under
418.
the
united
farm
worker
versus
la
casita
case
was
affirmed
by
the
texas
court
civil
appeals.
i
would
also
like
to
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
preamble
that
we
discussed
earlier
in
my
remarks
is
not,
i
don’t
believe
in
the
briefs
unless
it
appears
preamble
to
54d
it
does
appear
in
the
official
reported
version
of
the
texas
statutes
and
its
available
there
for
the
court
but
i’m
not
certainly
available
in
the
briefs.
we
believe
that
there
has
to
be
a
showing
of
a
general
pattern
for
each
particular
statute
before
the
kind
of
federal
court
intervention
talk
to
appear
is
proper.
we
don’t
believe
that
a
pattern
which
just
talked
generally
of
what
happened
under
a
lot
of
statutes
is
sufficient.
for
instance,
under
54d
the
54
under
obstruction
statute,
evidence
is
that
there
were
only
about
25
arrests
for
that
in
the
briefs
spoken
out
by
mr.
dixie
when
the
ranger
was
there
after
may
11.
the
first
thing
that
captain
allee
did
is
shown
in
mr.
dixie’s
brief
was
to
go
out
and
tell
the
people
to
get
50
feet
apart
which
they
did.
a
week
later,
he
came
back
and
they
were
not
50
feet
apart.
they
are
bunched
up
in
a
bunch
and
arrests
were
made
and
arrests
were
made
on
couple
of
other
occasions
under
circumstances
which
were
clearly
violative
of
the
texas
act.
there
is
no
statement
made
in
the
briefs
and
in
the
record
that
there
was
any
violence
that
i’m
aware
of
it
attached
to
those
arrests
under
54d.
we
say
that
there
can’t
be
an
injunction
whether
the
statutes
be
held
constitutional
but
the
--
under
the
theory
of
saying
perhaps
that
they
might
be
enjoined
because
it
was
a
bad
faith
prosecution
with
no
reasonable
hope
of
conviction.
that’s
clear
enough
to
case
here.
these
statutes
are
facially
valid.
picket
as
we
have
discussed
54d
and
some
detail
with
the
court,
less
the
court
to
so
find
it
and
to
so
find
it
facially
valid.
mr.
larry
f.
york
your
honor,
we
don’t
agree
with
all
of
some
what
we
might
call
editorializing
but
as
far
as
the
findings
of
fact
can
say
they
were
largely
undisputed
and
we
have
no
particularly
quarrel
with
the
facts.
we
may
disagree
with
some
of
the
conclusions
or
statements
made
by
the
court
about
what
the
fact
show
that
is
their
conclusions
for
more
or
less
undisputed
facts.
but
before
as
their
conclusion
about
what
the
facts
themselves
were,
we
have
a
not
particular
disagreement
with
that
and
have
not
urged
it
upon
this
court.
mr.
larry
f.
york
well,
that’s
the
part
of
it
that
we
did
challenge
in
the
sense
of
talking
about
the
conclusions
that
they
raise
it
from.
mr.
larry
f.
york
yes,
sir.
mr.
larry
f.
york
the
standard
of
review
is
far
as
--
mr.
larry
f.
york
i
think
in
that
area
that
is
not
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
in
the
sense
of
findings
of
fact
but
it’s
an
area
of
simply
discussing
the
case
isn’t
trying
to
determine
whether
under
the
case
is
lift
particular
--
mr.
larry
f.
york
i
believe
it
is.
i
like
the
bad
faith
aspect
covered
in
that
sense
is
wrong
question
your
honor.
mr.
larry
f.
york
well,
as
a
conclusion
from
these
facts,
whether
it’s
sufficient
under
the
younger
cases.
mr.
larry
f.
york
well
it’s
a
mixed
law
and
fact
question.
