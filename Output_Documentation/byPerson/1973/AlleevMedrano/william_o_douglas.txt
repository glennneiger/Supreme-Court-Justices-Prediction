justice
william
o.
douglas
first
of
these
is
72-1125
from
--
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
in
texas.
the
appellees
or
the
union
and
members
of
the
union,
and
the
appellants
are
police
and
sheriff
of
a
county
in
texas,
and
the
controversy
arose
in
connection
with
the
effort
of
the
union
to
unionize
farm
workers.
the
opinion
is
long;
the
facts
are
involved;
the
decision
that
we
filed
today
for
majority
of
the
court
in
the
case
that
there
are
parts
of
the
action
of
the
district
court
that
were
within
the
permissible
limits
of
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
in
the
federal
statute
that
enjoining
some
of
the
police
actions
were
justified.
however,
in
the
broad
reach
of
the
case
there
were
five
texas
statutes
involved
which
the
district
court
declared
unconstitutional,
but
it
appears
that
three
of
those
statutes
have
been
repealed
and
replaced
by
more
narrowly
grown
provisions
since
the
time
of
this
decision
by
the
district
court.
accordingly
we
are
not
sure
what
the
opinion
status
maybe.
so
we
remand
--
we
reverse
in
part
and
--
affirmed
in
part
and
remand
in
part
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
this
is
a
decision
in
which
mr.
justice
powell
took
no
part
and
in
which
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
dissenting
in
part
and
concurring
in
part,
and
he
is
joined
in
that
opinion
by
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
