chief

we’ll
here
arguments
next
in
72-1125
allee
against
medrano.
mr.
york
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
dixie.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
dixie,
are
you
--
before
you
go
on,
you
referred
to
wholesale
arrests,
am
i
correct?
that
the
arrests
were
at
the
rate
of
about
one
a
week
here
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it’s
13
months,
should
it
be
not
much
more
than
one
a
week,
would
it?
you
say
60
and
i
think
someone
else
said
70
in
the
briefs
arrest.
are
those
figures
wrong?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
particularly
the
number
of
arrests.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
am
just
interest
now
in
the
numbers,
then
you
argue
it
later.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
they
were
concentrated
in
that
area.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
timing
in
terms
of
this
business
of
putting
sugar
in
the
gas
tanks
and
some
violence
that
was
suggested?
when
did
that
occur
in
relation
to
the
period
you’re
talking
about?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
mean
that’s
the
consequences
applied
to
this
situation
because
of
the
large
area
involved
but
that
--
would
you
say
that
would
be
true
on
a
factory
in
houston
or
dallas
located
on
one
city
park?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
two
factual
settings
are
quite
distinct
in
this
respect,
aren’t
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
thousand
acre
farm
as
against
a
city
block
factory?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what’s
the
distance
from
the
factory
or
the
plant
under
this
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
50
feet,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
a
massive
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
but
you’re
--
were
looking
aren’t
you
the
central
thrust
to
justice
brennan’s
question
that
the
holding
of
the
three-judge
court
was
the
time
to
the
statute
is
void
on
its
phase?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
we
should
say
that’s
not
so.
then
how
could
we
sort
out
which
of
this
acts,
isn’t
the
district
court
in
much
better
position
to
do
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
it’s
unconstitutional
facially
as
to
ten
people,
why
isn’t
it
unconstitutional
for
everybody
in
texas?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
you
just
stand
on
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
court
which
are
not
challenged
here,
isn’t
that
your
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
dixie.
mr.
york,
you
have
about
4
minutes
left,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
agree
that
we
take
the
facts
as
found
by
the
district
court
here
since
state
of
texas
has
have
challenged
the
fact
finding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
