unknown
speaker
did
the
record
show
what
kind
of
a
weapon?
unknown
speaker
a
total
of
how
many
arrests?
unknown
speaker
arrest
--
they
made
more
arrest
in
that
over
the
13
months
period
i’m
sure
of
various
people
but
you
mean
70
connected
with
this
labor
organizing
activity?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
of
anybody
for
anything?
unknown
speaker
so
these,
many
of
these
arrests
weren’t
at
all
connected
with
the
activity
involved
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
were
arrest
of
people,
were
they
not?
or
if
i
get
it
all
wrong
involved
in
this
union
organizing
activity?
unknown
speaker
you’re
not
talking
about
the
total
arrest
in
that
county
--
unknown
speaker
that’s
my
question.
unknown
speaker
so
all
of
this
60
to
70
arrests
were
connected
with
what’s
that
issue
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
york?
unknown
speaker
i
from
my
own
glanced
at
the
appendix
developed
the
idea
that
is
to
article
482,
the
section
on
abusive
language
that
the
district
court
invalidated,
none
of
the
individual
plaintiffs
in
this
case
have
been
prosecuted
under
that
particular
section
or
threaten
with
prosecution.
am
i
wrong?
unknown
speaker
but
where
they
of
the
individual
plaintiffs
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
don’t
bother.
unknown
speaker
i
might
say
i
share
the
same
inquiry
that
justice
rehnquist
has
expressed.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
mr.
york?
unknown
speaker
at
that
time,
do
i
gather
the
state
injunction
proceeding
was
complete
--
completed,
no
appeal
was
taken
from
the
injunction?
unknown
speaker
i’m
thinking
at
as
of
the
time
this
action
was
brought.
unknown
speaker
well
do
we
have
the
date
when
the
affirmance
of
the
appellate
court
was
presented?
unknown
speaker
well
that’s
it
then.
unknown
speaker
the
state
injunctive
proceeding
then
must
do
a
contending
when
this
action
was
filed.
unknown
speaker
and
let
me
ask
again,
it
is
still
in
effect?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
highest
court
you
could
appeal
to,
the
one
that
--
unknown
speaker
and
that’s
the
discretion
that
you
appeal,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
in
the
circumstances
of
a
particular
case?
unknown
speaker
and
then
after
a
showing
of
violence,
would
it
not
--
or
threatened
violence
growing
out
on
the
circumstance
of
the
particular
case
shown
to
a
court
of
equity?
unknown
speaker
how
many
other
states
did
you
say
have
a
statute
such
as
this
that
makes
it
applicable
to
every
kind
of
situation
involving
on
merit
controversy?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
what’s
this
mr.
york
that
had
--
how
was
section
1
apply,
two
pickets
that
is
in
relation
of
picketing
offenses?
unknown
speaker
apparently,
you
have
--
the
pickets
have
to
be
at
least
50
feet
away
from
the
office?
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
i
--
does
that
mean
and
the
pickets
have
to
be
50
feet
apart,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
nor,
may
they
be
within
50
feet
of
one
another,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
the
two
compete
within
the
two
pickets
from
each
other?
unknown
speaker
the
two
can
be
right
at
the
entrance?
two
can
be
right
at
the
entrance,
not
more
than
two?
unknown
speaker
the
next
to
have
to
be
at
least
50
feet
away?
that’s
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at.
it’s
not
then
that
there
may
be
only
two
pickets
50
feet
apart.
unknown
speaker
it’s
not
that
that.
they
may
be
walking
pairs.
but
the
pairs
have
to
be
50
feet
apart.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
before
the
(inaudible)
they
have
two
pickets?
unknown
speaker
or
is
it
valid
was
all
liability
going
down
to
street?
and
this
will
be
about
49
feet,
that’s
all
is
available.
so
can
only
have
two
pickets?
unknown
speaker
cameron
against
johnson
wasn’t
that
a
very
similar
statute.
that
was
an
obstruction
statute,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
york.
unknown
speaker
did
the
final
order
of
the
district
court
prevent
the
name
of
the
defendants,
the
appellants
here
from
going
ahead
with
then
pending
criminal
prosecutions
under
the
statutes
that
were
invalidated?
unknown
speaker
looking
at
the
jurisdictional
statement
on
page
101
paragraph
15
of
the
final
judgment
last
few
lines
over
on
page
101.
did
they
enjoined
from
arresting,
from
imprisoning,
from
filing
criminal
charges,
from
threatening
to
arrest
but
would
you
say
in
effect
that
because
it
doesn’t
use
the
word
prosecuting
the
state
officials
were
free
to
go
ahead
and
prosecute?
unknown
speaker
have
you
treated
it
as
enjoining
you
from
prosecuting
as
well
as
--
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
kind
of
a
narrow
line
to
walk
though,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
what
about
enforcing
the
injunction
under
the
1967?
unknown
speaker
are
any
of
them
or
any
of
them
defendants
in
this
suit?
unknown
speaker
well
how
about
enforcing
that
in
the
67
injunction?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
that
--
is
that
where
the
case
is
now?
unknown
speaker
it’s
never
come
forward
as
still
a
temporary
exemption
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
and
the
case
is
still
pending?
unknown
speaker
where
the
defendants
there,
some
to
plaintiffs
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dixie,
in
paragraph
15
of
the
final
decree
on
page
101
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
the
injunction
does
cover
imprisoning.
would
a
proper
construction
of
that
be
that
although
you
could
prosecute,
you
couldn’t
imprison
somebody
or
would
that
just
mean
imprisoning
with
the
prior
to
the
filing
of
charge?
unknown
speaker
yet
the
district
court
certainly
the
thrust
of
its
opinion.
isn’t
that
valid
statutes
were
being
abused
in
violation
of
your
clients
constitutional
rights
but
that
the
statute
themselves
were
invalid?
unknown
speaker
they
could
have
more
–
furthermore,
i
wouldn’t
think
that
the
fact
that
they
didn’t
enjoin
any
pending
criminal
prosecutions
would
avoid
the
thrust
of
the
younger
cases.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
do
you
got
to
say
about
that?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
the
harassment
and
bad
faith
would
have
to
exist
with
respect
to
each
of
these
statutes?
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
apparently
is
no?
unknown
speaker
so
you
could
just
find
a
general
pattern
and
then
pick
out
any
statute
you
want
and
say
there
is
bad
faith
in
its
enforcement.
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
you
did
here
apparently
because
with
respect
to
some
of
the
statutes,
there
--
concededly
there
is
no
bad
face
enforcement.
unknown
speaker
well
then
you
say
would
they
respect
to
each
work.
unknown
speaker
and
you
must
feel
that?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
with
the
record
then
to
say
if
you’ve
satisfied
that.
unknown
speaker
because
i
gather
by
looking
at
the
page
50
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
you
have
explicit
finding
by
the
three-judge
court
and
that
all
of
those
prosecutions
under
each
of
the
statute
for
instance
in
bad
faith
and
for
the
purpose
of
harassment.
unknown
speaker
you
say
that’s
what
brings
you
again
the
younger
exception?
unknown
speaker
my
brother
white
has
said,
i
supposed
that
depends
on
the
record.
we
have
to
go
in
to
this
record
to
see
whether
that
is
supported
by
what?
by
substantial
evidence
or
what?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dixie?
unknown
speaker
the
district
court
opinion
on
page
41
relating
to
article
482
the
abusive
language
statute
says
that
five
union
members
had
been
arrested
on
that
day.
it
doesn’t
indicate
that
they
were
named
plaintiffs
in
this
action.
was
one
of
the
named
plaintiffs
in
this
action
at
sometime
according
the
record
prosecuted
under
482?
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
know
about
the
name
of
the
plaintiffs.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
dixie.
am
i
right,
the
three-judge
court
did
not
hold
these
several
statutes
that
it
did
hold
unconstitutional?
unconstitutional
as
applied
but
facially
unconstitutional
of
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
defending
that
holding
aren’t
you?
unknown
speaker
so
we
--
then
we
don’t
have
in
occasion
to
look
at
the
statute
in
the
context
that
you
say
as
applied
to
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
the
issue
defending
him
or
a
judgment
both
that
facially
the
statutes
are
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
and
that
you’re
wrong
about
that
nevertheless
we
have
to
find
that
as
applied?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dixie,
i
know
your
time
is
running
but
this
is
a
massive
case?
unknown
speaker
we
talk
in
all
of
that.
if
we
were
to
disagree
with
the
three-judge
court
as
to
some
or
all
of
these
statute
as
to
their
facial
--
the
holding
of
their
facially
unconstitutional,
are
you
suggesting
that
we
ought
then
examine
this
enormous
record
and
decide
for
ourselves
whether
as
applied,
they
are
also
unconstitutional
or
should
we
remand
this
as
long
as
three-judge
court
to
do
it?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
but
we
have
other
things
to
do
too.
unknown
speaker
i’m
right
that
only
784
was
held
to
be
facially
constitutional,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
where
that
was
held
to
be
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
and
what
we
have
as
a
picketing
statute,
the
bad
words
statute
--
unknown
speaker
and
all
of
them
would
and
secondary
boycott.
unknown
speaker
so
that’s
four
that
were
held
to
be
facially
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
and
only
the
fifth
with
instructions
statute
held
to
be
facially
constitutional.
unknown
speaker
that’s
one
we
had
here
in
the
gunn
case.
unknown
speaker
that
was
474.
unknown
speaker
you
make
the
point
in
your
brief
that
the
action
of
the
court
below
does
not
prevent
any
state
authorities
other
than
the
specific
ten
peace
officers
involved
here
from
enforcing
the
statutes
against
any
other
people
instead
of
texas.
unknown
speaker
how
hard
could
that
be
so
mostly
unconstitutional
if
it’s
held
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dixie,
i
understood
the
chief
justice
ask
you
if
it’s
facially
unconstitutional.
it’s
an
--
you
can’t
apply
it
to
anyone
in
the
state
of
texas
regardless
of
the
aggravated
circumstances
that
might
attend
its
application
to
your
client.
isn’t
that
a
correct
statement?
unknown
speaker
how
can
they
construe
a
statute
after
this
court?
if
this
court
agreed
with
the
judge
courts,
then
they
are
way
across
the
books,
aren’t
they?
well
is
there
anything
left
for
the
state
courts
to
construe?
unknown
speaker
at
least
not
an
overbreadth.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
it
that
you
do
challenge?
there
is
an
explicit
finding
of
conduct
that
was
in
bad
faith
and
harassment.
unknown
speaker
so,
they
don’t
add
up
to
that?
unknown
speaker
what
should
be
standard
of
review
for
us
to
apply?
we
have
done
this
before.
unknown
speaker
the
findings
of
harassment
in
bad
faith.
say
you
don’t
challenge
the
historical
facts.
to
say
the
historical
facts
as
found
don’t
end
up
to
harassment
in
bad
faith.
now
what
standard
of
review
should
we
apply?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
suggesting
to
me
that’s
a
question
of
law?
unknown
speaker
bad
faith
is
unusually
a
wrong
question
or
harassment?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
it’s
like
negligence?
so
that
is
not
--
unknown
speaker
did
the
record
show
what
kind
of
a
weapon?
unknown
speaker
a
total
of
how
many
arrests?
unknown
speaker
arrest
--
they
made
more
arrest
in
that
over
the
13
months
period
i’m
sure
of
various
people
but
you
mean
70
connected
with
this
labor
organizing
activity?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
of
anybody
for
anything?
unknown
speaker
so
these,
many
of
these
arrests
weren’t
at
all
connected
with
the
activity
involved
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
were
arrest
of
people,
were
they
not?
or
if
i
get
it
all
wrong
involved
in
this
union
organizing
activity?
unknown
speaker
you’re
not
talking
about
the
total
arrest
in
that
county
--
unknown
speaker
that’s
my
question.
unknown
speaker
so
all
of
this
60
to
70
arrests
were
connected
with
what’s
that
issue
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
york?
unknown
speaker
i
from
my
own
glanced
at
the
appendix
developed
the
idea
that
is
to
article
482,
the
section
on
abusive

that
the

none
of
the
individual
plaintiffs
in
this
case
have
been
prosecuted
under
that
particular
section
or
threaten
with
prosecution.
am
i
wrong?
unknown
speaker
but
where
they
of
the
individual
plaintiffs
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
don’t
bother.
unknown
speaker
i
might
say
i
share
the
same
inquiry
that
justice
rehnquist
has
expressed.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
mr.
york?
unknown
speaker
at
that
time,
do
i
gather
the
state
injunction
proceeding
was
complete
--
completed,
no
appeal
was
taken
from
the
injunction?
unknown
speaker
i’m
thinking
at
as
of
the
time
this
action
was
brought.
unknown
speaker
well
do
we
have
the
date
when
the
affirmance
of
the
appellate
court
was
presented?
unknown
speaker
well
that’s
it
then.
unknown
speaker
the
state
injunctive
proceeding
then
must
do
a
contending
when
this
action
was
filed.
unknown
speaker
and
let
me
ask
again,
it
is
still
in
effect?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
highest
court
you
could
appeal
to,
the
one
that
--
unknown
speaker
and
that’s
the
discretion
that
you
appeal,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
in
the
circumstances
of
a
particular
case?
unknown
speaker
and
then
after
a
showing
of
violence,
would
it
not
--
or
threatened
violence
growing
out
on
the
circumstance
of
the
particular
case
shown
to
a

of

unknown

how
many
other
states
did
you
say
have
a
statute
such
as
this
that
makes
it
applicable
to
every
kind
of
situation
involving
on
merit
controversy?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
what’s
this
mr.
york
that
had
--
how
was
section
1
apply,
two
pickets
that
is
in
relation
of
picketing
offenses?
unknown
speaker
apparently,
you
have
--
the
pickets
have
to
be
at
least
50
feet
away
from
the
office?
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
i
--
does
that
mean
and
the
pickets
have
to
be
50
feet
apart,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
nor,
may
they
be
within
50
feet
of
one
another,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
the
two
compete
within
the
two
pickets
from
each
other?
unknown
speaker
the
two
can
be
right
at
the
entrance?
two
can
be
right
at
the
entrance,
not
more
than
two?
unknown
speaker
the
next
to
have
to
be
at
least
50
feet
away?
that’s
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at.
it’s
not
then
that
there
may
be
only
two
pickets
50
feet
apart.
unknown
speaker
it’s
not
that
that.
they
may
be
walking
pairs.
but
the
pairs
have
to
be
50
feet
apart.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
before
the
(inaudible)
they
have
two
pickets?
unknown
speaker
or
is
it
valid
was
all
liability
going
down
to
street?
and
this
will
be
about
49
feet,
that’s
all
is
available.
so
can
only
have
two
pickets?
unknown
speaker
cameron
against
johnson
wasn’t
that
a
very
similar
statute.
that
was
an
obstruction
statute,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.

did
they
enjoined

but
would
you
say
in
effect
that
because
it
doesn’t
use
the
word
prosecuting
the
state
officials
were
free
to
go
ahead
and
prosecute?
unknown
speaker
have
you
treated
it
as
enjoining
you
from
prosecuting
as
well
as
--
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
kind
of
a
narrow
line
to
walk
though,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
what
about
enforcing
the
injunction
under
the
1967?
unknown
speaker
are
any
of
them
or
any
of
them
defendants
in
this
suit?
unknown
speaker
well
how
about
enforcing
that
in
the
67
injunction?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
that
--
is
that
where
the
case
is
now?
unknown
speaker
it’s
never
come
forward
as
still
a
temporary
exemption
of
the
--
unknown
speaker
and
the
case
is
still
pending?
unknown
speaker
where
the
defendants
there,
some
to
plaintiffs
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dixie,
in
paragraph
15
of
the
final
decree
on
page
101
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
the
injunction
does
cover
imprisoning.
would
a
proper
construction
of
that
be
that
although
you
could
prosecute,
you
couldn’t
imprison
somebody
or
would
that
just
mean
imprisoning
with
the
prior
to
the
filing
of
charge?
unknown
speaker
yet
the
district
court
certainly
the
thrust
of
its
opinion.
isn’t
that
valid
statutes
were
being
abused
in
violation
of
your
clients
constitutional
rights
but
that
the
statute
themselves
were
invalid?
unknown
speaker
they
could
have
more
–
furthermore,
i
wouldn’t
think
that
the
fact
that
they
didn’t
enjoin
any
pending
criminal
prosecutions
would
avoid
the
thrust
of
the
younger
cases.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
do
you
got
to
say
about
that?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
the
harassment
and
bad
faith
would
have
to
exist
with
respect
to
each
of
these
statutes?
unknown
speaker
so
your
answer
apparently
is
no?
unknown
speaker
so
you
could
just
find
a
general
pattern
and
then
pick
out
any
statute
you
want
and
say
there
is
bad
faith
in
its
enforcement.
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
you
did
here
apparently
because
with
respect
to
some
of
the
statutes,
there
--
concededly
there
is
no
bad
face
enforcement.
unknown
speaker
well
then
you
say
would
they
respect
to
each
work.
unknown
speaker
and
you
must
feel
that?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
with
the
record
then
to
say
if
you’ve
satisfied
that.
unknown
speaker
because
i
gather
by
looking
at
the
page
50
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
you
have
explicit
finding
by
the
three-judge
court
and
that
all
of
those
prosecutions
under
each
of
the
statute
for
instance
in
bad
faith
and
for
the
purpose
of
harassment.
unknown
speaker
you
say
that’s
what
brings
you
again
the
younger
exception?
unknown
speaker
my
brother
white
has
said,
i
supposed
that
depends
on
the
record.
we
have
to
go
in
to
this
record
to
see
whether
that
is
supported
by
what?
by
substantial
evidence
or
what?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dixie?
unknown
speaker
the
district
court
opinion
on
page
41
relating
to
article
482
the
abusive
language
statute
says
that
five
union
members
had
been
arrested
on
that
day.
it
doesn’t
indicate
that
they
were
named
plaintiffs
in
this
action.
was
one
of
the
named
plaintiffs
in
this
action
at
sometime
according
the
record
prosecuted
under
482?
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
know
about
the
name
of
the
plaintiffs.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
dixie.
am
i
right,
the
three-judge
court
did
not
hold
these
several
statutes
that
it
did
hold
unconstitutional?
unconstitutional
as
applied
but
facially
unconstitutional
of
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
defending
that
holding
aren’t
you?
unknown
speaker
so
we
--
then
we
don’t
have
in
occasion
to
look
at
the
statute
in
the
context
that
you
say
as
applied
to
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
the
issue
defending
him
or
a
judgment
both
that
facially
the
statutes
are
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
and
that
you’re
wrong
about
that
nevertheless
we
have
to
find
that
as
applied?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dixie,
i
know
your
time
is
running
but
this
is
a
massive
case?
unknown
speaker
we
talk
in
all
of
that.
if
we
were
to
disagree
with
the
three-judge
court
as
to
some
or
all
of
these
statute
as
to
their
facial
--
the
holding
of
their
facially
unconstitutional,
are
you
suggesting
that
we
ought
then
examine
this
enormous
record
and
decide
for
ourselves
whether
as
applied,
they
are
also
unconstitutional
or
should
we
remand
this
as
long
as
three-judge
court
to
do
it?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
but
we
have
other
things
to
do
too.
unknown
speaker
i’m
right
that
only
784
was
held
to
be
facially
constitutional,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
where
that
was
held
to
be
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
and
what
we
have
as
a
picketing
statute,
the
bad
words
statute
--
unknown
speaker
and
all
of
them
would
and
secondary
boycott.
unknown
speaker
so
that’s
four
that
were
held
to
be
facially
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
and
only
the
fifth
with
instructions
statute
held
to
be
facially
constitutional.
unknown
speaker
that’s
one
we
had
here
in
the
gunn
case.
unknown
speaker
that
was
474.
unknown
speaker
you
make
the
point
in
your
brief
that
the
action
of
the
court
below
does
not
prevent
any
state
authorities
other
than
the
specific
ten
peace
officers
involved
here
from
enforcing
the
statutes
against
any
other
people
instead
of
texas.
unknown
speaker
how
hard
could
that
be
so
mostly
unconstitutional
if
it’s
held
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dixie,
i
understood
the
chief
justice
ask
you
if
it’s
facially
unconstitutional.
it’s
an
--
you
can’t
apply
it
to
anyone
in
the
state
of
texas
regardless
of
the
aggravated
circumstances
that
might
attend
its
application
to
your
client.
isn’t
that
a
correct
statement?
unknown
speaker
how
can
they
construe
a
statute
after
this
court?
if
this
court
agreed
with
the
judge
courts,
then
they
are
way
across
the
books,
aren’t
they?
well
is
there
anything
left
for
the
state
courts
to
construe?
unknown
speaker
at
least
not
an
overbreadth.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
it
that
you
do
challenge?
there
is
an
explicit
finding
of
conduct
that
was
in
bad
faith
and
harassment.
unknown
speaker
so,
they
don’t
add
up
to
that?
unknown
speaker
what
should
be
standard
of
review
for
us
to
apply?
we
have
done
this
before.
unknown
speaker
the
findings
of
harassment
in
bad
faith.
say
you
don’t
challenge
the
historical
facts.
to
say
the
historical
facts
as
found
don’t
end
up
to
harassment
in
bad
faith.
now
what
standard
of
review
should
we
apply?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
suggesting
to
me
that’s
a
question
of
law?
unknown
speaker
bad
faith
is
unusually
a
wrong
question
or
harassment?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
it’s
like
negligence?
so
that
is
not
--
