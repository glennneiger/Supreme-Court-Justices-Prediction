mr.
chris
dixie
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
we
made
it
clear
to
the
district
court
and
we
file
several
briefs
in
which
we
stated
that
we
do
not
intend
to
interdict
any
pending
criminal
prosecution.
one
of
our
observations
in
this
case
has
been
so
many
arrests
and
not
one
case
set
for
trial.
as
far
as
we’re
concerned
under
this
order,
these
criminal
cases
could
be
tried.
other
criminal
cases
could
be
filed
under
the
statutes,
any
state
official
other
than
the
name
defendants
and
those
acting
in
consort
with
them
and
successors
and
office
can
prosecute
under
this
statutes.
mr.
chris
dixie
that
injunction
runs
against
five
texas
rangers
and
five
peace
officers
down
there.
mr.
chris
dixie
yes,
sir.
that
suit,
there
are
defendant
there.
mr.
chris
dixie
in
the
67
injunction.
what
are
you
referring
to
a
state
court
injunction?
mr.
chris
dixie
i
have
a
little
correction
to
give
you
on
that
counsel
was
not
with
us
on
the
ground
or
in
the
trial
court.
that
state
court
injunction
was
an
application
for
temporary
injunction
which
alleged
that
the
picketing
was
illegal
for
many
reasons
and
the
trial
court
rendered
that
injunction.
the
court
of
civil
appeals
reversed
that
and
said
that
the
picketing
was
legal
in
all
respects
insofar
as
its
purposes
must
concern.
but
they
said
there
is
some
circumstantial
evidence
of
destruction
of
property,
dropping
of
nails,
putting
gasoline
in
tanks
and
so
forth
and
we
will
hold
that
that
circumstantial
evidence
was
sufficient
to
justify
a
temporary
injunction
only
and
we
express
no
opinion
as
to
what
will
be
the
situation
when
the
case
comes
forward
on
the
merits.
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right.
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right.
and
it
took
the
texas
courts.
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right
and
it
took
the
texas
courts
about
three
years
to
settle
the
question
of
a
temporary
injunction.
mr.
chris
dixie
the
union
was
a
common
--
was
a
common
party,
the
united
farmworkers
organizing
committee.
mr.
chris
dixie
your
honor,
a
proper
construction
of
that
i
believe
would
be
that
these
particular
officers
should
not
arrest
people
and
put
them
in
jail
under
these
particular
statutes.
but
it
doesn’t
say
that
the
county
attorney
or
the
district
attorney
or
the
attorney
general
can’t
file
charges
and
cause
a
law
and
to
issue
and
arrest
somebody
and
prosecute
him
all
the
way
through.
a
very
limited
injunction
because
the
essence
of
this
case
is
the
abuse
of
the
police
power
in
the
manipulation
of
this
statutes
by
this
people
who
there
findings
of
fact
establish
what
acting
and
active
consort
with
the
private
owners
to
break
and
strike
through
a
period
of
one
year.
we
were
attempting
to
get
relief
from
this
wholesale
arrests
and
mistreatments
that
we
were
subjected
to
and
then
as
far
as
litigation
is
concerned
we
were
and
are
prepared
to
defend
ourselves
anytime
that
these
things
are
set
for
trial.
mr.
chris
dixie
yes.
yes
they
held
that
they
--
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
would
have
and
at
least
declare
the
statutes
unconstitutional
when
at
least
to
expect
to
some
of
the
statute,
they
were
pending
state
criminal
prosecutions?
yes.
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
we
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
we
say
that
we
are
well
within
the
doctrine
of
the
younger
cases.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
this
fact
situation
is
not
strong
enough
to
satisfy
younger,
we
doubt
that
you’ll
ever
find
--
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
your
honor,
these
statutes
were
interwoven
in
their
use
and
they
were
used
--
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right,
that’s
right.
it’s
a
whole
course
--
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
no.
mr.
chris
dixie
oh
no!
with
respect
with
each
and
--
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right.
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right,
with
respect
to
each
one
there
was
bad
faith
–-
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right.
mr.
chris
dixie
maybe
it’s
correct.
mr.
chris
dixie
that
is
correct.
they
--
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
your
honor,
these
fact
findings
are
unchallenged.
one
of
--
you
have
extensive
district
court
fact
findings
and
you
don’t
have
one
mention
of
rule
52
or
any
statement
that
they
are
clearly
erroneous
or
anything
like
that
in
this
case.
this
--
i’ve
been
so
puzzled
why
the
attorney
general
has
presented
the
case
this
way
when
he
his
jurisdictional
statement
appear.
he
made
no
issue
of
the
findings
of
fact
and
we
call
the
court’s
attention
and
then
when
he
filed
his
brief
on
the
merits,
you
give
the
same
thing,
they
just
ignore
the
fact
findings
of
the
district
court
and
this
is
a
very
remarkable
case
in
its
fact.
almost
unduplicated
and
in
fact
it
is
unduplicated
in
any
decided
case
that
i
know
of.
i
suggest
your
honors
that
we
start
in
this
case
with
the
findings
of
fact
which
have
not
yet
been
challenged.
now
then
including
--
mr.
chris
dixie
and
that’s
not
correct
your
honor.
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
i’m
afraid
you
do
your
honor,
may
i
summarize
it
for
you
this
way.
i
believe
--
mr.
chris
dixie
i
believe
our
arrest
say
that
we
have
produced
55
cases
of
arrest
while
the
arrestees
were
engaged
in
first
amendment
protected
activities.
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right.
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
it
didn’t
work
that
way.
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
arrests
built
up
to
a
crescendo
and
that’s
probably
one
thing
i
should
explain
to
you.
on
may
11,
the
union
developed
important
support
on
the
mexican
side
and
the
situation
developed
that
the
mexican
farmworkers
were
not
coming
across
the
bridge
to
work
through
these
picket
lines.
on
that
day
at
4
o’clock
in
the
morning
captain
allee,
the
texas
ranger
got
up
out
of
bed
and
drove
1
or
200
miles
forthwith
to
the
scene.
then
there,
started
a
series
of
arrests,
interspersed
with
brutality,
beatings,
terrorism,
the
works
from
may
11
until
june
1
and
on
june
1,
the
union
threw
up
its
hands
and
no
one
could
get
adherence
under
those
conditions.
so
the
average
of
one
of
week
is
a
mechanical
average
but
its
not
--
it
doesn’t
reflect
the
crescendo
of
activities.
mr.
chris
dixie
well
of
course.
mr.
chris
dixie
well
it
was
unrelated
to
it.
i
can’t
see
it
directly
and
i’m
not
even
sure
that
that’s
in
this
record
but
the
--
i
think
that
what
they’re
complaining
about
happened
about
a
year
before
this
may
of
1967.
of
course
you’re
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
district
court
found
that
none
of
these
things
was
brought
forth
to
the
union
or
any
of
its
members
in
the
proof.
this
district
court
found
that
and
they
also
found
that
in
the
entire
year,
the
only
case,
a
physical
violence
was
when
one
of
our
people
reached
and
touched
the
arm
of
a
truck
driver
as
he
passed
by
taking
him
by
the
sleeve
and
the
sleeve
of
course
slipped
out
of
the
man’s
hand
and
the
truck
went
on
and
the
district
court
explicitly
found
that
that
was
the
only
case
of
physical
violence
on
the
part
that
any
union
adherent
during
the
year.
now
to
go
to
your
other
question
your
honor,
down
in
south
texas
you
get
about
four
crops
a
year
and
there
is
a
planting
time
and
there
is
a
harvesting
time
and
these
rise
of
arrests
took
place
at
the
times
when
the
union
would
accelerate
at
its
activities
to
reach
the
workers
during
the
planting
time,
during
the
harvesting
time.
that’s
when
the
workforce
is
large,
that’s
when
the
union
would
make
its
effort
to
organize
and
that’s
when
the
arrest
would
take
place.
so
the
arrest
well
timed
to
kill
direct
the
potential
effectiveness
of
the
strike.
now,
to
move
on,
this
case
was
found
as
a
class
action
by
the
union
and
by
several
individuals
and
the
court
found
that
it
was
a
proper
class
action
by
this
people
and
they
are
adequate
representatives
of
the
class
and
there
has
never
been
any
question
in
the
district
court
from
the
defendant
and
not
the
propriety
of
that.
the
fact
findings
recite
that
there
was
a
one
year
conspiracy
of
arrest
without
charges,
dispersals,
threats,
bonding
abuses,
inducements
by
peace
officers
to
the
strikers
to
abandon
there’s
the
union
and
go
back
to
work
and
physical
violence,
all
of
it
was
mixed
up
with
an
interspersed
with
the
institution
of
prosecutions
in
bad
faith.
mr.
chris
dixie
yes,
sir.
mr.
chris
dixie
i
would
have
to
check
the
record
to
determine
that.
i
know
union
officers
were.
mr.
chris
dixie
and
i
will
have
to
check
to
answer
that.
i’ll
have
to
check
to
see
who
was
there
that
day
and
was
arrested.
now
then,
the
judgment
as
i’ve
told
the
court
does
not
interdict
to
any
pending
prosecutions.
it’s
a
limited
injunction
and
part
of
the
injunction,
is
civil
rights
relief
under
1983
or
1985
on
the
count
of
the
conspiracy
of
this
public
officers
to
use
the
color
of
there
officers.
i’d
like
to
tell
the
court
something
about
the
legal
background
of
this
case.
texas
law
provides
in
a
statute
cited
in
our
brief
that
any
person
may
try
to
induce
any
other
person
to
quit
any
employment
enjoining
the
union
for
the
purpose
of
bettering
their
conditions.
texas
law
gives
the
right
to
bargain
collectively
or
individually.
it
provides
that
if
a
labor
contract
is
signed.
the
contract
is
lawful
and
not
--
may
not
be
a
violated,
that’s
similar
to
section
301
of
the
taft-hartley
act
so
that
everything
that
the
plaintiffs
did
in
this
case
in
terms
of
their
ultimate
objective
was
lawful
under
the
texas
statute
and
the
attorney
general
stipulated
as
much
at
the
trial
of
the
case.
so
in
all
of
the
application
of
the
statutes,
please
bear
in
mind
your
honors
that
at
no
time
we
were,
where
we
doing
anything
prohibited
by
texas
law,
now
texas
law
also
provides
that
an
employer
has
no
duty
to
recognize
a
union.
he
may
contract
with
it
or
he
may
refuse.
he
may
contract
for
all
of
them
or
some
of
them
or
one
of
them.
and
if
he
does
want
the
union,
he’s
got
a
right
to
fight.
in
this
case,
the
employers
did
elect
to
take
to
the
economic
contest
and
so
the
situation
in
this
case
is
that
the
union
was
doing
precisely
what?
the
state
law
contemplates
that
you
have
to
do
in
that
situation.
there
is
no
question
of
the
union’s
violation
of
the
ultimate
public
policy.
now,
the
economic
background
of
this
situation
is
that
starr
county
texas
according
to
the
census
figures
as
one
of
the
poorest
in
the
united
states.
the
economic
condition
of
this
county
and
this
farmworkers
is
the
lowest
in
texas
substantially
lower
than
our
black
population
which
god
knows
is
low
enough.
the
growers
operate
large
farms,
hundreds
of
acres,
vast
fields,
we
have
pictures
in
here
to
show
you
and
by
stipulation,
it
is
developed
that
they
--
that
they
whole
in
the
agricultural
workers
by
vast
loads
from
far
distances.
there
is
no
such
thing
in
this
case
as
a
congested
traffic
situation.
everything
takes
place
on
the
open
road
or
out
in
the
woods
and
it
is
in
that
context
that
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
evaluate
the
application
of
the
50-foot
law
by
the
state
of
texas.
but
we
have
brought
cases
here
where
the
texas
rangers
went
out
during
the
harvesting
season
in
may
and
they
have
three
pickets
out
in
the
woods
on
the
side
of
the
field
who
were
calling
to
the
strike
to
the
workers
to
come
out.
those
three
were
arrested
for
past
picketing
that
was
more
than
two.
then
there
were
ten
other
mexican
americans
under
the
shade
of
the
tree
under
that
hot
day
and
the
evidence
shows
that
the
ranger
captain
says
run
them
into
for
mass
picketing
statute.
mr.
chris
dixie
facially
unconstitutional
is
what
i
understand
that
they
held,
they
say
--
mr.
chris
dixie
yes,
indeed.
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
it
seems
to
me
and
i
believe
that
the
chief
justice
has
written
in
one
opinion
that
i
took
care
for
load
up
that
one
of
the
ways
you
can
come
to
the
conclusion
of
overbreadth
the
most
easily
is
if
it’s
validated
by
the
actual
application
of
the
statute
to
constitutionally
protect
--
mr.
chris
dixie
absolutely.
mr.
chris
dixie
that
is
correct.
now
then
this
50-foot
statute,
you
got
no
traffic
problems,
they
apply
it
without
reference
to
obstruction
and
they
say
that
in
every
situation
to
every
50
feet
is
enough.
now
let’s
look
at
the
position
of
the
union
and
the
members
in
this
case.
they
are
trying
to
induce
hundreds
of
farmworkers
to
join
them
and
the
state
wants
to
have
two
pathetic-looking
pickets
out
there
in
an
economic
contest
or
economic
power
is
going
to
settle
the
issue
and
the
state
says
that
that’s
constitutionally
sufficient
while
any
politician
knows
that
when
you
have
a
rally
and
you
have
a
good
attendance,
that
makes
you
look
like
a
winner
and
encourages
people
to
support
you
enjoin
with
you
and
believe
in
your
cause.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
statute,
not
the
whole
purpose
but
the
whole
effect
of
the
statute
is
to
make
the
union
look
pathetic
in
a
state
mandated
economic
contest
where
they
violate
no
public
policy
when
they’re
trying
to
get
the
others
to
join
them.
mr.
chris
dixie
the
number
of
pickets
would
depend
upon
the
situation,
that’s
what
this
court
has
said
many
times.
the
physical
surroundings
--
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right.
mr.
chris
dixie
that
is
correct
but
you
can
also
have
a
factory
with
3000
workers.
we
have
such
factories
in
texas
while
require
two
pickets.
incidentally,
this
statute
prohibits
observers,
people
who
come
there
to
see
what
will,
how
their
welfare
is
being
in
handled
and
if
they’re
across
the
street
standing
in
a
group
and
not
blocking
anybody.
they
are
guilty
of
mass
picketing
because
they
are
more
than
two
every
50
feet,
your
honor
and
because
they
are
there
to
observe.
mr.
chris
dixie
it
makes
no
difference.
mr.
chris
dixie
no,
it
makes
no
difference.
you
can
be
300
feet
away
but
if
you
are
there
to
observe
or
to
induce
people
and
you
stand
closer
together
than
two
every
50
feet
you
violate
the
statute.
that’s
an
unbelievable
statute
but
that’s
what
it
does.
it
violates
the
statute
to
be
that
far
away
and
it
has
been
so
applied.
now,
i’m
afraid
my
time
is
getting
away
from
me
here.
one
of
the
interesting
features
of
this
case
is
--
mr.
chris
dixie
well
it
would
certainly
be
a
shame
to
remand
this
case
after
all
this
many
years
of
litigation.
but
we’re
not
asking
for
anything
except
our
constitutional
rights.
mr.
chris
dixie
i
believe
the
fact
findings
are
adequate
to
take
you
your
honor
passed
the
question
of
examining
the
record.
they’re
all
in
the
fact
findings.
all
you
have
to
do
is
line
up
debates
and
see
how
--
mr.
chris
dixie
yes.
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
that’s
a
question
of
your
judgment
in
judicial
administration
and
you
might
wish
to
remand
the
case
in
that
situation.
however,
the
facial
unconstitutionality
of
these
statutes
other
than
the
50-foot
statute
seems
to
me
to
be
well
demonstrated
by
practically
white
horse
cases
from
this
court.
several
of
them
within
the
last
few
terms
and
participated
in
by
the
present
personnel
of
the
court.
i
see
no
occasion
to
read
seriously
believe
that
the
statutes
are
not
facially
unconstitutional.
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
another
obstruction
statute.
mr.
chris
dixie
then
it
was
indeed.
mr.
chris
dixie
and
unlawful
assembly
statute.
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right.
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right.
mr.
chris
dixie
that
is
correct
and
then
a
disturbing
the
peace
statute
was
held
unconstitutional
and
made
an
appeal
on
that
one.
that
was
also
held
by
another
three-judge
court
and
the
legislature
has
since
amended
that
statute.
mr.
chris
dixie
yes.
mr.
chris
dixie
yes,
of
disturbing
the
peace
statute,
right.
and
i
might
say,
i
might
--
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right.
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
we
took
the
heart
of
what
you
said
in
younger
versus
harris
one
of
the
important
considerations
is
to
exercise
as
much
committee
for
the
state
processes
as
his
consistent
with
the
protection
of
first
amendment
rights.
we
come
forward
with
something
that
our
hope
is
in
a
main
event
in
this
case.
we
leave
the
door
open
for
legitimate
prosecution
and
clarification
of
the
statutes
to
make
up
constitutional
while
at
the
same
time
obtaining
the
necessary
relief
here
to
keep
the
first
amendment
alive
in
starr
county
texas.
it’s
a
question
of
trying
to
confirm
to
younger
v.
harris
teachings.
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
that
gets
us
to
another
question
if
the
chief
justice
please.
no
one
in
texas
has
been
arrested
under
the
mass
picketing
statute
on
the
criminal
side
of
the
docket
since
that
statute
was
passed
in
1947
just
this
farmworkers.
in
fact
i
have
never
--
i
have
been
practicing
at
the
texas
by
35
years
i
have
never
known
for
this
case
one
person
arrested
for
peaceful
picketing.
they
have
injunction
cases
to
regulate
the
picketing
and
even
injunction
to
stop
all
picketing
which
might
be
illegal
but
it
was
reserved
for
this
latin
americans
to
face
jail,
six
months
in
jail
we
make
quite
a
point
of
the
tricky
ways
in
which
of
the
complaints
were
drawn
and
the
statutes
were
invoked
in
order
to
terrorize
the
people.
we
have
--
mr.
chris
dixie
if
that
--
that
is
a
correct
statement
but
it’s
still
open
to
the
state
court
to
construe
these
statutes
with
plastic
surgery
or
something
in
ways
that
would
bring
them
within
constitutional
standards
and
the
door
is
open
for
them.
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
i
never
had
understood,
i
never
have
understood.
let
us
say
that
a
declaratory
judgment
would
be
res
adjudicata
as
to
the
interpretation
that
a
state
court
is
going
to
give
to
a
state
statute.
you
can
declare
a
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
the
way
i
understand
it,
the
state
court
can
read
your
decision
and
comeback
later
with
a
decision
and
say
their
honors
in
washington
were
mistaken
about
the
interpretation
of
this
case
that
we
construe
it
vast
and
so
and
if
they
construe
it
in
the
constitutional
way.
that
is
it,
you
are
looking
--
you
are
probably
looking
at
a
judicial
declaration
bound
this
court
as
a
repeal.
it
might
be
that.
i
never
have
looked
at
it
that
way.
anyway
--
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right
and
i
see
my
light
is
on
here.
i
think
that
there
is
important
area
for
the
legislature
and
these
state
courts
to
deal
with
these
overbreadth
problems
and
even
with
these
vagueness
problems
and
this
is
one
place
where
it
seems
to
me
that
they
have
been
a
little
slow
in
catching
on
in
the
first
amendment
area.
your
honor
ruled
an
opinion
recently
in
which
you
said
that
the
facial
unconstitutionality
declaration
is
from
madison.
well,
that’s
true
but
in
another
respect,
it’s
not
strong
madison
if
the
legislature
will
just
sit
down
and
amend
the
law
as
a
non
controversial
problem
to
tie
it
up.
first
amendment
wise
so
that
it
cannot
be
misused
as
it
has
been
misused
in
this
case
and
i
was
thinking
that
perhaps
this
court
--
i
hope
it’s
not
an
improper
suggestion
ought
to
consider
saying
so
to
the
states
because
they’re
a
little
bit
slow
on
the
uptake.
this
court
should
tell
them.
they
have
a
duty
to
enforce
the
constitution
just
like
you
do.
they
should
respond
to
your
decisions.
well,
i
haven’t
been
able
within
my
time
to
cover
the
facts
and
so
i
will
respectfully
refer
you
to
the
brief.
i’ll
use
the
rest
of
my
time
to
say
this
to
you
your
honor.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
so
bad
from
the
standpoint
of
official
lowliness
that
this
case
calls
out
--
calls
for
something
to
be
said
by
this
court
to
disabuse
the
minds
of
peace
officers
that
this
kind
of
conduct
is
tolerable.
i
respectfully
say
to
you
that
your
efforts
up
on
the
bench
and
our
efforts
down
here
in
the
pit
to
encourage
respect
for
a
law
and
order
are
going
to
fail.
they’re
going
to
be
futile
if
this
kind
of
conduct
by
peace
officers
is
allowed
to
go
unremitted
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
chris
dixie
yes
and
as
i
say
is
severity
of
the
facts.
it
lasted
for
a
year
and
the
biddings
were
unspeakable
and
the
terrorism
was
unspeakable.
i
will
tell
you
frankly,
i
hated
to
go
down
there
to
try
that
case
for
my
hometown
of
houston
where
we
think
we
are
little
bit
more
civilized
but
it
was
a
duty
and
we’ve
carry
that
to
all
this
way
and
we
ask
this
court
to
do
what’s
right
to
let
this
law
officers
know
that
the
supreme
court
does
not
tolerate
this
type
of
conduct.
mr.
chris
dixie
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
the
court
please.
we
made
it
clear
to
the
district
court
and
we
file
several
briefs
in
which
we
stated
that
we
do
not
intend
to
interdict
any
pending
criminal
prosecution.
one
of
our
observations
in
this
case
has
been
so
many
arrests
and
not
one
case
set
for
trial.
as
far
as
we’re
concerned
under
this
order,
these
criminal
cases
could
be
tried.
other
criminal
cases
could
be
filed
under
the
statutes,
any
state
official
other
than
the
name
defendants
and
those
acting
in
consort
with
them
and
successors
and
office
can
prosecute
under
this
statutes.
mr.
chris
dixie
that
injunction
runs
against
five
texas
rangers
and
five
peace
officers
down
there.
mr.
chris
dixie
yes,
sir.
that
suit,
there
are
defendant
there.
mr.
chris
dixie
in
the
67
injunction.
what
are
you
referring
to
a
state
court
injunction?
mr.
chris
dixie
i
have
a
little
correction
to
give
you
on
that
counsel
was
not
with
us
on
the
ground
or
in
the
trial
court.
that
state
court
injunction
was
an
application
for
temporary
injunction
which
alleged
that
the
picketing
was
illegal
for
many
reasons
and
the
trial
court
rendered
that
injunction.
the
court
of
civil
appeals
reversed
that
and
said
that
the
picketing
was
legal
in
all
respects
insofar
as
its
purposes
must
concern.
but
they
said
there
is
some
circumstantial
evidence
of
destruction
of
property,
dropping
of
nails,
putting
gasoline
in
tanks
and
so
forth
and
we
will
hold
that
that
circumstantial
evidence
was
sufficient
to
justify
a
temporary
injunction
only
and
we
express
no
opinion
as
to
what
will
be
the
situation
when
the
case
comes
forward
on
the
merits.
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right.
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right.
and
it
took
the
texas
courts.
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right
and
it
took
the
texas
courts
about
three
years
to
settle
the
question
of
a
temporary
injunction.
mr.
chris
dixie
the
union
was
a
common
--
was
a
common
party,
the
united
farmworkers
organizing
committee.
mr.
chris
dixie
your
honor,
a
proper
construction
of
that
i
believe
would
be
that
these
particular
officers
should
not
arrest
people
and
put
them
in
jail
under
these
particular
statutes.
but
it
doesn’t
say
that
the
county
attorney
or
the
district
attorney
or
the
attorney
general
can’t
file
charges
and
cause
a
law
and
to
issue
and
arrest
somebody
and
prosecute
him
all
the
way
through.
a
very
limited
injunction
because
the
essence
of
this
case
is
the
abuse
of
the
police
power
in
the
manipulation
of
this
statutes
by
this
people
who
there
findings
of
fact
establish
what
acting
and
active
consort
with
the
private
owners
to
break
and
strike
through
a
period
of
one
year.
we
were
attempting
to
get
relief
from
this
wholesale
arrests
and
mistreatments
that
we
were
subjected
to
and
then
as
far
as
litigation
is
concerned
we
were
and
are
prepared
to
defend
ourselves
anytime
that
these
things
are
set
for
trial.
mr.
chris
dixie
yes.
yes
they
held
that
they
--
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
would
have
and
at
least
declare
the
statutes
unconstitutional
when
at
least
to
expect
to
some
of
the
statute,
they
were
pending
state
criminal
prosecutions?
yes.
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
we
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
we
say
that
we
are
well
within
the
doctrine
of
the
younger
cases.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
this
fact
situation
is
not
strong
enough
to
satisfy
younger,
we
doubt
that
you’ll
ever
find
--
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
your
honor,
these
statutes
were
interwoven
in
their
use
and
they
were
used
--
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right,
that’s
right.
it’s
a
whole
course
--
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
no.
mr.
chris
dixie
oh
no!
with
respect
with
each
and
--
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right.
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right,
with
respect
to
each
one
there
was
bad
faith
–-
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right.
mr.
chris
dixie
maybe
it’s
correct.
mr.
chris
dixie
that
is
correct.
they
--
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
your
honor,
these
fact
findings
are
unchallenged.
one
of
--
you
have
extensive
district
court
fact
findings
and
you
don’t
have
one
mention
of
rule
52
or
any
statement
that
they
are
clearly
erroneous
or
anything
like
that
in
this
case.
this
--
i’ve
been
so
puzzled
why
the
attorney
general
has
presented
the
case
this
way
when
he
his
jurisdictional
statement
appear.
he
made
no
issue
of
the
findings
of
fact
and
we
call
the
court’s
attention
and
then
when
he
filed
his
brief
on
the
merits,
you
give
the
same
thing,
they
just
ignore
the
fact
findings
of
the
district
court
and
this
is
a
very
remarkable
case
in
its
fact.
almost
unduplicated
and
in
fact
it
is
unduplicated
in
any
decided
case
that
i
know
of.
i
suggest
your
honors
that
we
start
in
this
case
with
the
findings
of
fact
which
have
not
yet
been
challenged.
now
then
including
--
mr.
chris
dixie
and
that’s
not
correct
your
honor.
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
i’m
afraid
you
do
your
honor,
may
i
summarize
it
for
you
this
way.
i
believe
--
mr.
chris
dixie
i
believe
our
arrest
say
that
we
have
produced
55
cases
of
arrest
while
the
arrestees
were
engaged
in
first
amendment
protected
activities.
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right.
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
it
didn’t
work
that
way.
as
a
matter
of
fact
these
arrests
built
up
to
a
crescendo
and
that’s
probably
one
thing
i
should
explain
to
you.
on
may
11,
the
union
developed
important
support
on
the
mexican
side
and
the
situation
developed
that
the
mexican
farmworkers
were
not
coming
across
the
bridge
to
work
through
these
picket
lines.
on
that
day
at
4
o’clock
in
the
morning
captain
allee,
the
texas
ranger
got
up
out
of
bed
and
drove
1
or
200
miles
forthwith
to
the
scene.
then
there,
started
a
series
of
arrests,
interspersed
with
brutality,
beatings,
terrorism,
the
works
from
may
11
until
june
1
and
on
june
1,
the
union
threw
up
its
hands
and
no
one
could
get
adherence
under
those
conditions.
so
the
average
of
one
of
week
is
a
mechanical
average
but
its
not
--
it
doesn’t
reflect
the
crescendo
of
activities.
mr.
chris
dixie
well
of
course.
mr.
chris
dixie
well
it
was
unrelated
to
it.
i
can’t
see
it
directly
and
i’m
not
even
sure
that
that’s
in
this
record
but
the
--
i
think
that
what
they’re
complaining
about
happened
about
a
year
before
this
may
of
1967.
of
course
you’re
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
district
court
found
that
none
of
these
things
was
brought
forth
to
the
union
or
any
of
its
members
in
the
proof.
this
district
court
found
that
and
they
also
found
that
in
the
entire
year,
the
only
case,
a
physical
violence
was
when
one
of
our
people
reached
and
touched
the
arm
of
a
truck
driver
as
he
passed
by
taking
him
by
the
sleeve
and
the
sleeve
of
course
slipped
out
of
the
man’s
hand
and
the
truck
went
on
and
the
district
court
explicitly
found
that
that
was
the
only
case
of
physical
violence
on
the
part
that
any
union
adherent
during
the
year.
now
to
go
to
your
other
question
your
honor,
down
in
south
texas
you
get
about
four
crops
a
year
and
there
is
a
planting
time
and
there
is
a
harvesting
time
and
these
rise
of
arrests
took
place
at
the
times
when
the
union
would
accelerate
at
its
activities
to
reach
the
workers
during
the
planting
time,
during
the
harvesting
time.
that’s
when
the
workforce
is
large,
that’s
when
the
union
would
make
its
effort
to
organize
and
that’s
when
the
arrest
would
take
place.
so
the
arrest
well
timed
to
kill
direct
the
potential
effectiveness
of
the
strike.
now,
to
move
on,
this
case
was
found
as
a
class
action
by
the
union
and
by
several
individuals
and
the
court
found
that
it
was
a
proper
class
action
by
this
people
and
they
are
adequate
representatives
of
the
class
and
there
has
never
been
any
question
in
the
district
court
from
the
defendant
and
not
the
propriety
of
that.
the
fact
findings
recite
that
there
was
a
one
year
conspiracy
of
arrest
without
charges,
dispersals,
threats,
bonding
abuses,
inducements
by
peace
officers
to
the
strikers
to
abandon
there’s
the
union
and
go
back
to
work
and
physical
violence,
all
of
it
was
mixed
up
with
an
interspersed
with
the
institution
of
prosecutions
in
bad
faith.
mr.
chris
dixie
yes,
sir.
mr.
chris
dixie
i
would
have
to
check
the
record
to
determine
that.
i
know
union
officers
were.
mr.
chris
dixie
and
i
will
have
to
check
to
answer
that.
i’ll
have
to
check
to
see
who
was
there
that
day
and
was
arrested.
now
then,
the
judgment
as
i’ve
told
the
court
does
not
interdict
to
any
pending
prosecutions.
it’s
a
limited
injunction
and
part
of
the
injunction,
is
civil
rights
relief
under
1983
or
1985
on
the
count
of
the
conspiracy
of
this
public
officers
to
use
the
color
of
there
officers.
i’d
like
to
tell
the
court
something
about
the
legal
background
of
this
case.
texas
law
provides
in
a
statute
cited
in
our
brief
that
any
person
may
try
to
induce
any
other
person
to
quit
any
employment
enjoining
the
union
for
the
purpose
of
bettering
their
conditions.
texas
law
gives
the
right
to
bargain
collectively
or
individually.
it
provides
that
if
a
labor
contract
is
signed.
the
contract
is
lawful
and
not
--
may
not
be
a
violated,
that’s
similar
to
section
301
of
the
taft-hartley
act
so
that
everything
that
the
plaintiffs
did
in
this
case
in
terms
of
their
ultimate
objective
was
lawful
under
the
texas
statute
and
the
attorney
general
stipulated
as
much
at
the
trial
of
the
case.
so
in
all
of
the
application
of
the
statutes,
please
bear
in
mind
your
honors
that
at
no
time
we
were,
where
we
doing
anything
prohibited
by
texas
law,
now
texas
law
also
provides
that
an
employer
has
no
duty
to
recognize
a
union.
he
may
contract
with
it
or
he
may
refuse.
he
may
contract
for
all
of
them
or
some
of
them
or
one
of
them.
and
if
he
does
want
the
union,
he’s
got
a
right
to
fight.
in
this
case,
the
employers
did
elect
to
take
to
the
economic
contest
and
so
the
situation
in
this
case
is
that
the
union
was
doing
precisely
what?
the
state
law
contemplates
that
you
have
to
do
in
that
situation.
there
is
no
question
of
the
union’s
violation
of
the
ultimate
public
policy.
now,
the
economic
background
of
this
situation
is
that
starr
county
texas
according
to
the
census
figures
as
one
of
the
poorest
in
the
united
states.
the
economic
condition
of
this
county
and
this
farmworkers
is
the
lowest
in
texas
substantially
lower
than
our
black
population
which
god
knows
is
low
enough.
the
growers
operate
large
farms,
hundreds
of
acres,
vast
fields,
we
have
pictures
in
here
to
show
you
and
by
stipulation,
it
is
developed
that
they
--
that
they
whole
in
the
agricultural
workers
by
vast
loads
from
far
distances.
there
is
no
such
thing
in
this
case
as
a
congested
traffic
situation.
everything
takes
place
on
the
open
road
or
out
in
the
woods
and
it
is
in
that
context
that
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
evaluate
the
application
of
the
50-foot
law
by
the
state
of
texas.
but
we
have
brought
cases
here
where
the
texas
rangers
went
out
during
the
harvesting
season
in
may
and
they
have
three
pickets
out
in
the
woods
on
the
side
of
the
field
who
were
calling
to
the
strike
to
the
workers
to
come
out.
those
three
were
arrested
for
past
picketing
that
was
more
than
two.
then
there
were
ten
other
mexican
americans
under
the
shade
of
the
tree
under
that
hot
day
and
the
evidence
shows
that
the
ranger
captain
says
run
them
into
for
mass
picketing
statute.
mr.
chris
dixie
facially
unconstitutional
is
what
i
understand
that
they
held,
they
say
--
mr.
chris
dixie
yes,
indeed.
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
it
seems
to
me
and
i
believe
that
the
chief
justice
has
written
in
one
opinion
that
i
took
care
for
load
up
that
one
of
the
ways
you
can
come
to
the
conclusion
of
overbreadth
the
most
easily
is
if
it’s
validated
by
the
actual
application
of
the
statute
to
constitutionally
protect
--
mr.
chris
dixie
absolutely.
mr.
chris
dixie
that
is
correct.
now
then
this
50-foot
statute,
you
got
no
traffic
problems,
they
apply
it
without
reference
to
obstruction
and
they
say
that
in
every
situation
to
every
50
feet
is
enough.
now
let’s
look
at
the
position
of
the
union
and
the
members
in
this
case.
they
are
trying
to
induce
hundreds
of
farmworkers
to
join
them
and
the
state
wants
to
have
two
pathetic-looking
pickets
out
there
in
an
economic
contest
or
economic
power
is
going
to
settle
the
issue
and
the
state
says
that
that’s
constitutionally
sufficient
while
any
politician
knows
that
when
you
have
a
rally
and
you
have
a
good
attendance,
that
makes
you
look
like
a
winner
and
encourages
people
to
support
you
enjoin
with
you
and
believe
in
your
cause.
the
whole
purpose
of
the
statute,
not
the
whole
purpose
but
the
whole
effect
of
the
statute
is
to
make
the
union
look
pathetic
in
a
state
mandated
economic
contest
where
they
violate
no
public
policy
when
they’re
trying
to
get
the
others
to
join
them.
mr.
chris
dixie
the
number
of
pickets
would
depend
upon
the
situation,
that’s
what
this
court
has
said
many
times.
the
physical
surroundings
--
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right.
mr.
chris
dixie
that
is
correct
but
you
can
also
have
a
factory
with
3000
workers.
we
have
such
factories
in
texas
while
require
two
pickets.
incidentally,
this
statute
prohibits
observers,
people
who
come
there
to
see
what
will,
how
their
welfare
is
being
in
handled
and
if
they’re
across
the
street
standing
in
a
group
and
not
blocking
anybody.
they
are
guilty
of
mass
picketing
because
they
are
more
than
two
every
50
feet,
your
honor
and
because
they
are
there
to
observe.
mr.
chris
dixie
it
makes
no
difference.
mr.
chris
dixie
no,
it
makes
no
difference.
you
can
be
300
feet
away
but
if
you
are
there
to
observe
or
to
induce
people
and
you
stand
closer
together
than
two
every
50
feet
you
violate
the
statute.
that’s
an
unbelievable
statute
but
that’s
what
it
does.
it
violates
the
statute
to
be
that
far
away
and
it
has
been
so
applied.
now,
i’m
afraid
my
time
is
getting
away
from
me
here.
one
of
the
interesting
features
of
this
case
is
--
mr.
chris
dixie
well
it
would
certainly
be
a
shame
to
remand
this
case
after
all
this
many
years
of
litigation.
but
we’re
not
asking
for
anything
except
our
constitutional
rights.
mr.
chris
dixie
i
believe
the
fact
findings
are
adequate
to
take
you
your
honor
passed
the
question
of
examining
the
record.
they’re
all
in
the
fact
findings.
all
you
have
to
do
is
line
up
debates
and
see
how
--
mr.
chris
dixie
yes.
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
that’s
a
question
of
your
judgment
in
judicial
administration
and
you
might
wish
to
remand
the
case
in
that
situation.
however,
the
facial
unconstitutionality
of
these
statutes
other
than
the
50-foot
statute
seems
to
me
to
be
well
demonstrated
by
practically
white
horse
cases
from
this
court.
several
of
them
within
the
last
few
terms
and
participated
in
by
the
present
personnel
of
the
court.
i
see
no
occasion
to
read
seriously
believe
that
the
statutes
are
not
facially
unconstitutional.
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
another
obstruction
statute.
mr.
chris
dixie
then
it
was
indeed.
mr.
chris
dixie
and
unlawful
assembly
statute.
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right.
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right.
mr.
chris
dixie
that
is
correct
and
then
a
disturbing
the
peace
statute
was
held
unconstitutional
and
made
an
appeal
on
that
one.
that
was
also
held
by
another
three-judge
court
and
the
legislature
has
since
amended
that
statute.
mr.
chris
dixie
yes.
mr.
chris
dixie
yes,
of
disturbing
the
peace
statute,
right.
and
i
might
say,
i
might
--
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right.
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
we
took
the
heart
of
what
you
said
in
younger
versus
harris
one
of
the
important
considerations
is
to
exercise
as
much
committee
for
the
state
processes
as
his
consistent
with
the
protection
of
first
amendment
rights.
we
come
forward
with
something
that
our
hope
is
in
a
main
event
in
this
case.
we
leave
the
door
open
for
legitimate
prosecution
and
clarification
of
the
statutes
to
make
up
constitutional
while
at
the
same
time
obtaining
the
necessary
relief
here
to
keep
the
first
amendment
alive
in
starr
county
texas.
it’s
a
question
of
trying
to
confirm
to
younger
v.
harris
teachings.
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
that
gets
us
to
another
question
if
the
chief
justice
please.
no
one
in
texas
has
been
arrested
under
the
mass
picketing
statute
on
the
criminal
side
of
the
docket
since
that
statute
was
passed
in
1947
just
this
farmworkers.
in
fact
i
have
never
--
i
have
been
practicing
at
the
texas
by
35
years
i
have
never
known
for
this
case
one
person
arrested
for
peaceful
picketing.
they
have
injunction
cases
to
regulate
the
picketing
and
even
injunction
to
stop
all
picketing
which
might
be
illegal
but
it
was
reserved
for
this
latin
americans
to
face
jail,
six
months
in
jail
we
make
quite
a
point
of
the
tricky
ways
in
which
of
the
complaints
were
drawn
and
the
statutes
were
invoked
in
order
to
terrorize
the
people.
we
have
--
mr.
chris
dixie
if
that
--
that
is
a
correct
statement
but
it’s
still
open
to
the
state
court
to
construe
these
statutes
with
plastic
surgery
or
something
in
ways
that
would
bring
them
within
constitutional
standards
and
the
door
is
open
for
them.
mr.
chris
dixie
well,
i
never
had
understood,
i
never
have
understood.
let
us
say
that
a
declaratory
judgment
would
be
res
adjudicata
as
to
the
interpretation
that
a
state
court
is
going
to
give
to
a
state
statute.
you
can
declare
a
statute
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
the
way
i
understand
it,
the
state
court
can
read
your
decision
and
comeback
later
with
a
decision
and
say
their
honors
in
washington
were
mistaken
about
the
interpretation
of
this
case
that
we
construe
it
vast
and
so
and
if
they
construe
it
in
the
constitutional
way.
that
is
it,
you
are
looking
--
you
are
probably
looking
at
a
judicial
declaration
bound
this
court
as
a
repeal.
it
might
be
that.
i
never
have
looked
at
it
that
way.
anyway
--
mr.
chris
dixie
that’s
right
and
i
see
my
light
is
on
here.
i
think
that
there
is
important
area
for
the
legislature
and
these
state
courts
to
deal
with
these
overbreadth
problems
and
even
with
these
vagueness
problems
and
this
is
one
place
where
it
seems
to
me
that
they
have
been
a
little
slow
in
catching
on
in
the
first
amendment
area.
your
honor
ruled
an
opinion
recently
in
which
you
said
that
the
facial
unconstitutionality
declaration
is
from
madison.
well,
that’s
true
but
in
another
respect,
it’s
not
strong
madison
if
the
legislature
will
just
sit
down
and
amend
the
law
as
a
non
controversial
problem
to
tie
it
up.
first
amendment
wise
so
that
it
cannot
be
misused
as
it
has
been
misused
in
this
case
and
i
was
thinking
that
perhaps
this
court
--
i
hope
it’s
not
an
improper
suggestion
ought
to
consider
saying
so
to
the
states
because
they’re
a
little
bit
slow
on
the
uptake.
this
court
should
tell
them.
they
have
a
duty
to
enforce
the
constitution
just
like
you
do.
they
should
respond
to
your
decisions.
well,
i
haven’t
been
able
within
my
time
to
cover
the
facts
and
so
i
will
respectfully
refer
you
to
the
brief.
i’ll
use
the
rest
of
my
time
to
say
this
to
you
your
honor.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
so
bad
from
the
standpoint
of
official
lowliness
that
this
case
calls
out
--
calls
for
something
to
be
said
by
this
court
to
disabuse
the
minds
of
peace
officers
that
this
kind
of
conduct
is
tolerable.
i
respectfully
say
to
you
that
your
efforts
up
on
the
bench
and
our
efforts
down
here
in
the
pit
to
encourage
respect
for
a
law
and
order
are
going
to
fail.
they’re
going
to
be
futile
if
this
kind
of
conduct
by
peace
officers
is
allowed
to
go
unremitted
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
chris
dixie
yes
and
as
i
say
is
severity
of
the
facts.
it
lasted
for
a
year
and
the
biddings
were
unspeakable
and
the
terrorism
was
unspeakable.
i
will
tell
you
frankly,
i
hated
to
go
down
there
to
try
that
case
for
my
hometown
of
houston
where
we
think
we
are
little
bit
more
civilized
but
it
was
a
duty
and
we’ve
carry
that
to
all
this
way
and
we
ask
this
court
to
do
what’s
right
to
let
this
law
officers
know
that
the
supreme
court
does
not
tolerate
this
type
of
conduct.
