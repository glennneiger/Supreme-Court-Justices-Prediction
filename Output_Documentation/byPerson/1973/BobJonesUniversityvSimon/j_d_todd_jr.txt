mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
of
course
on
certiorari
to
the
fourth
court
of
appeals.
we
represent
bob
jones
university
which
is
a
unique
university.
it
has
a
slogan,
“the
world’s
most
unusual
university.”
i
think
it
can
safely
be
said
that
that
is
true.
it
is
a
university
which
has
deep
religious
backgrounds,
deep
religious
roots.
its
--
every
class
is
opened
and
closed
with
prayer.
the
university
admission’s
policy
requires
an
examination
into
the
religious
beliefs
of
those
who
apply
and
who
are
admitted.
one
of
the
religious
beliefs
of
the
university
is
that
the
scriptures
prohibit
the
intermarriage
of
the
races
and
that
it
would
be
scripturally
wrong
for
members
of
different
races
to
marry.
based
upon
that
religious
belief
which
has
been
its
belief
since
the
commencement
of
the
university
in
1927,
i
believe,
it
has
refused
admissions
to
blacks.
it
has
admitted
a
few
orientals
under
a
rule
that
says
those
who
are
admitted
cannot
date
members
of
other
races
while
at
the
university.
the
university
feels
that
at
the
college
level
is
when
most
romantic
attachments
are
formed
between
parties
and
when
their
life’s
partners
are
frequently
chosen.
for
that
reason,
it
has
adhered
to
the
policy
that
no
blacks
are
admitted
to
the
university.
now,
certainly
since
1942,
the
university
has
been
an
exempt
organization
under
the
provisions
of
501
(c)
(3).
it
has
met
all
the
requirements
of
501
(c)
(3)
as
set
forth
by
congress.
those
requirements
are
briefly
that
the
organization
be
one
who’s
chief
activity
is
religious,
educational,
or
charitable
that
its
operations
in
europe
to
the
private
profit
of
no
one
and
that
it
not
engage
in
any
substantial
lobbying
activities.
there's
never
been
any
question
but
at
bob
jones
university,
it
met
all
of
those
requirements.
in
the
letter
from
the
collector
in
1943
or
42,
it
was
stated
that
it
was
entitled
to
a
tax
exempt
status
and
that
such
tax
exempt
status
would
continue
unless
there
was
some
change
in
the
operations
of
the
university.
there
has
been
no
change
in
the
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
we
are
sure
they
had
tax
exempt
status
from
the
founding
but
we
have
not
been
able
to
trace
that
out.
we
have
the
first
and
only
thing
that
we
find
in
the
record
of
the
university
is
the
1942
letter
from
the
district
collector
of
internal
revenue
at
that
time.
it
operated
in
the
same
manner
from
its
inception
until
1942.
and
1942
was
no
different
in
the
other
year.
we
just
don’t
have
any
proof
that
they
were
recognized
as
exempt
by
the
internal
revenue
service
prior
to
1942.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
they
--
the
exact
time
when
it
begun,
i
do
not
know.
they
--
of
course
501
(c)
(3)
was
--
has
a
history
of
about
60
years
or
so.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
and
--
but
when
the
advance
letters
or
assurance
of
deductibility
was
instituted,
i
cannot
say
it
has
been
a
practice
for
many,
many
years
certainly
since
1942.
and
when
an
organization
receives
such
a
letter,
it
is
entitled
to
be
listed
in
the
cumulative
index
of
such
organization.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
i
think
that’s
true
and
i
think
it
did
receive
such
treatment.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
i
think
that’s
true,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no
question
about
it.
it’s
a
great
benefit
and
it’s
a
privilege,
i
understand
that.
it’s
a
thing
that
an
organization
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
exactly
(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
very
true
and
while
the
individual
donors
don’t
perhaps
check
it
too
much,
certainly
foundations
do
because
if
they
make
one
contribution
to
an
unauthorized
or
non-exempt
organization,
there
deductibility
would
be
withdrawn
or
probably
would
be
withdrawn
so
it’s
a
vital
importance
to
the
foundations
and
such
organizations
as
that.
our
record
shows
correspondence
between
us
and
the
nationwide
foundation,
the
insurance
company
in
ohio
where
they
had
been
making
matching
grants
and
where
they
--
in
view
of
the
questionable
status
of
the
university
refused
to
make
anymore
matching
grants.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
oh,
yes.
well,
i
think
that’s
right.
i
don’t
think
you
can
get
on
the
list
without
the
letter.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it’s
of
estimable
benefit
to
an
organization
which
is
a
non-profit
organization
which
can
exist
only
through
donations
of
those
who
are
impelled
to
give
to
that
organization.
there
is,
of
course,
no
requirement
that
anyone
give
an
exempt
organization.
it’s
a
matter
of
personal
preference
and
choice
for
each
person
that
happens
to
give.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
i
think
that’s
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
correct,
sir.
that
would
be
true.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
if
there
had
been
no
letter.
if
there
had
been
no
cumulative
index
or
listing,
i
think
no,
i
think
not.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
well
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
correct.
being
on
the
list
is
a
vital
importance
because
donors
will
presumably
--
well,
actually
we
know,
they
won’t
yield
it
if
they
are
not.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
well
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
if
we
ask
for
a
mandatory
injunction,
the
defense
of
sovereign
immunity
might
apply
which
it
doesn’t
in
this
case
because
we
ask
for
no
affirmative
relief
against
any
office
of
the
united
states.
we
ask
merely
for
an
injunction.
that’s
the
only
difference
that
concurs
to
me.
that
is
a
defense
that
the
government
pleaded
in
this
case
and
advanced
in
the
district
level
but
now
concedes
as
inapplicable
to
this
particular
case
and
not
from
the
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
has
not
been
withdrawn.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
right,
sir.
the
district
court
of
course
issued
the
injunction.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
but
the
advance
assurance
of
deductibility
has
not
been
withdrawn.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no
sir.
there
was
no
stay
outstanding.
we
applied
for
a
stay
and
the
court
did
not
see
fit
to
grant
it.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
i
think
that’s
right.
it
was
revoked
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
well,
our
deductions,
our
contributions,
it
fallen
off
some,
i
would
not
say
that
they
have
dried
up
but
as
long
as
we
have
that
assurance
of
the
advance
assurance
as
they
have
not
dried
up
and
we
have
not
suffered
the
irreparable
harm
that
we
would
have
suffered
had
not
the
district
court
originally
granted
the
injunction.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
it’s
a
practice
by
the
commissioner.
there
is
no
statutory
justification
point
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
we
are
on
the
so-called
list,
yes
sir.
i
don’t
think
we
would've
been
on
the
so-called
list
had
we
not
had
the
letter
to
start
with.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
correct
sir,
it
is.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that
--
that’s
correct
and
while
as
i
say,
as
i've
said
a
few
minutes
ago,
the
individual
donors,
of
small
individual
donors,
i
don’t
think
that
would
make
a
lot
of
difference.
it
does
make
a
lot
of
difference
to
foundations.
i
think
that’s
where
the
real
damage
came
as
a
result
of
the
announcement
of
the
irs
that
it
would
be
withdrawn.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
i
think
that’s
correct,
yes
sir.
i
think
other
possible
donors
would
approach
it
with
caution
and
i
think
the
donors
that
have
given
an
interim
or
people
who
were
firmly
motivated
to
give
and
who
are
not
altogether
swayed
by
the
deductibility
of
their
contributions.
but
as
i
say,
donations
and
contributions
have
been
much
less
free
as
it
were
before.
now
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
it
would
--
we
would
come
into
to
play.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
correct
sir.
that’s
correct.
that’s
a
vital
importance
of
the
foundation
not
give
any
gift
to
anyone
whose
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
--
eligibility
on
the
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
--
501
(c)
(3)
is
in
debt.
at
any
rate,
this
announcement
from
the
irs
to
the
effect
that
the
irs
could
no
longer
grant
advance
assurance
of
deductibility
to
schools
who
practice
a
racially,
discriminatory
policy
no
matter
why
they
had
that
policy
resulted
in
this
lawsuit.
there
was
no
act
of
congress
that
aided
that
provision
to
501
(c)
(3)
as
one
of
the
conditions
for
an
exempt
organization.
congress
had
very
specifically
set
forth
what
was
necessary
to
be
an
exempt
organization
and
that
didn’t
happen
to
be
one
of
the
requirements
that
was
set
forth.
at
any
rate,
and
it’s
our
contention
and
the
lower
court
held
that
the
commissioner
exceeded
the
statutory
authority
given
him
that
he
has
authority
to
promulgate
regulations
but
not
to
change
law
and
that
that’s
a
matter
for
congress
to
decide
and
we
of
course
contend
that
that’s
absolutely
correct.
now,
it’s
our
--
we
must
concede
that
bob
jones
university
has
a
remedy
at
law.
bob
jones
university,
if
its
exempt
status
is
destroyed,
will
be
in
a
position
where
it
will
have
to
pay
not
only
unemployment
taxes
but
income
taxes
as
well.
and
we
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
on
the
income
from
operating
the
university
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
tuition
and
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
yes.
well,
i
think
it
is
one
of
the
universities
i
have
said
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
yes
sir.
but
this
university
as
i
said
as
the
world’s
most
unusual
university
and
it
has
made
a
profit
which
has
been
applied
back
into
plant
and
other
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no,
not
bothered
about
depreciation.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
they
haven’t
been
bothered
by
depreciation.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
we
have
been
exempt
so
why
bother
with
depreciation?
their
have
bookkeeping
procedures
have
not
--
the
auditors
have
not
bothered
with
depreciation
at
all
because
depreciation
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no
question
about
that
and
perhaps
they
would
not
be
as
substantial
as
we
think
but
we
would
still
have
to
pay
them
and
that
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
tuition,
room
and
board.
the
operation
of
the
student
center
and
those
things
where
they
sell
drinks
and
soft
drinks,
i
might
add
--[laughter]
--
to
the
students
and
faculty.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
not
an
inter
--
interscholastic.
they
do
have
intramural
athletics.
they
have
a
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no,
no,
no
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
well
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
correct.
they
do
have
investments
which
they
have
realize
income
from.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
at
any
rate
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
i
don’t
think
there's
any
question
about
that?
its
--
the
record
so
says
and
i
don’t
think
there's
ever
been
any
question
but
what
it
is,
an
organization
operated
not
to
anyone’s
individual
profit.
it
inures
to
the
profit
of
no
individual.
the
university
is
--
believes
it
caused
it
some
detriment.
it
could
not
contentiously
sign
the
certificate
of
compliance
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
therefore
it
voluntarily
has
foregone
all
grants
of
any
kind
or
nature.
it
received
no
grants
of
any
kind
or
nature
from
the
federal
government,
any
branch
of
the
federal
government
or
any
branch
of
the
state
government.
it
absolutely
goes
it
on
its
own
with
its
own
operation
and
its
own
donors.
it
has
no
gifts
or
grants
of
any
kind
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
the
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
3,500
and
a
faculty
of
about
650.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no
graduate,
all
undergraduate.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
we
--
that
substantially
is
what
this
case
is
your
honor
except,
we
have
the
letter
and
we
have
this
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
against
the
withdrawal
of
the
exempt
status
of
bob
jones
university.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
wouldn’t
think
so.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
because
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
it
--
as
the
district
court
said
in
this
case,
it
involved
taxes
only
very
remotely.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
under
the
literal
times
of
the
injunction
statute,
any
case
involving
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
i
agree
that
it
would
be
barred
by
the
anti-injunction
statute
with
no
court
rule
such
as
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
the
difference
in
that
and
this
is
that
the
university
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
yes.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
for
one
thing,
prospective
donors
without
the
letter,
without
the
listing
would
not
be
inclined
to
donate.
i
think
that
is
the
big
difference.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
as
to
the
anti-injunction
statute,
i
don’t
suppose
there
is
too
much
difference
in
the
two
situations
except
that
without
the
letter
and
without
the
advance
assurance
of
deductibility,
we
would've
been
paying
taxes
and
our
donors
would've
not
have
been
--
would
not
have
been
entitled
to
deductions
from
their
income.
at
any
rate,
if
we
read
the
terms
of
the
anti-injunction
statute
literally,
there
is
no
exception,
there
is
no
exception.
this
court
has
recognized
that
there
are
exceptions.
it
created
exceptions.
in
the
hill
case,
hill
against
wallace,
it
created
exceptions.
in
miller
against
standard
nut
margarine
and
it
created
an
exception
and
enochs
against
williams
packing.
now
the
government
suggested
if
the
rule
in
enochs
against
williams
packing
is
to
be
changed
that
it
should
be
by
the
legislature
rather
than
by
the
court,
i
respectfully
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
rule
of
enochs
against
williams
packing
is
not
a
legislative
rule,
it’s
a
court
originated
rule.
it’s
a
rule
that
the
legislature
had
nothing
to
do
with
but
the
court
in
(inaudible)
power
to
do
justice
between
the
government
and
the
citizens
evolve
the
rule
in
enochs
against
williams.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that
in
effect
is
correct
but
we
abide
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that
--
that’s
right.
that’s
right,
sir.
the
ruling
is
what
we
are
vitally
concerned
about
plus
the
publication
of
that
ruling.
if
the
ruling
is
made
in
a
vacuum,
if
it
is
not
publicized,
if
the
donors
don’t
know
about
the
ruling
and
we
can’t
get
it
to
him
in
any
effective
way,
then
of
course,
we
are
concerned
about
it.
we
are
concern
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
well,
well,
that’s
right.
and
the
ruling
issue
does
have
the
right
contents
and
we
are
listed
in
the
cumulative
index
of
the
--
list
of
exempt
organizations.
we
are
listed
there
and
it
is
a
benefit
to
the
university.
the
position
of
the
university
really
is
that
the
rule
in
enochs
against
williams
packing
has
no
real
application
to
exempt
organizations
as
was
pointed
out
in
one
of
the
previous
arguments.
the
--
any
injunction
statute
was
passed
in
1867
long
before
we
had
any
question
about
exempt
organizations,
charitable
deductions,
or
income
tax
for
that
matter.
and
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no.
no
question
about
that
your
honor.
it
does
apply
to
income
taxes
and
it
does
apply
to
exempt
organizations
as
the
irs
attempts
to
enforce
it
but
we
think
that
as
far
as
exempt
organizations
are
concerned
who
--
source
of
revenue
can
be
dried
up
by
a
mere
withdrawing
of
that
advance
assurance
of
deductibility
who
can
face
one
as
a
--
the
amici
brief
in
the
americans
united
case
pointed
out
and
it’s
a
matter
that
mr.
thrall
who
was
commissioner
at
the
time,
made
a
speech
in
dallas,
have
said,
“we
understand
and
realize
that
our
mere
refusal
to
rule
on
an
application
can
doom
an
organization
that
under
those
circumstances,
under
those
circumstances,
a
different
rule
than
the
one
applied
in
williams
packing
should
be
adopted.”
obviously,
williams
packing
goes
a
long
ways
to
protect
the
internal
revenue
service
and
the
receipt
of
the
government
revenues
and
obviously
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no,
that’s
right.
the
statute
went
that
far.
it
went
farther
but
i
think
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
right.
it
certainly
did.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no,
sir.
i’m
asking
the
court
to
exercise
and
hear
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
to
fall
--
fashion
a
remedy
that
would
be
fair
and
applicable
to
the
internal
revenue
service
and
to
the
charitable
or
exempt
organizations.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
correct
sir.
and
the
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that
--
that’s
correct
your
honor.
and
i
don’t
think
that
involves
a
question
of
assessment
or
collection
of
a
tax
against
bob
jones
university
as
is
apparent
from
the
record
in
this
case.
bob
jones
university
can
pay
every
tax
that
the
government
intends
to
assess
and
collect
against
it
by
purely
and
simply
abandon
its
religious
convictions
and
changing
its
admissions
policy.
the
record
is
clear
from
the
deposition
of
mr.
connick
(ph),
the
assistant
collector
of
internal
revenue
in
charge
of
exempt
organizations
to
the
effect
that,
if
bob
jones
university
changes
its
admissions
policy,
we
would
not
revoke
its
advance
assurance
of
deductibility.
so,
really
we
are
not
talking,
in
my
opinion,
we’re
not
talking
about
taxes.
we
are
talking
about
as
mr.
crampton
remarked
in
the
previous
case,
some
people
try
to
use
the
internal
revenue
service
as
a
club
against
those
that
they
don’t
like
or
with
whom
they
have
differences.
we’re
attempting
to
keep
the
internal
revenue
service
from
using
the
club
of
withdrawing
our
advance
assurance
of
deductibility
to
adopt
an
admissions
policy
which
is
not
dictated
by
any
act
of
congress
on
admission
policy
which
is
contrary
to
the
firm
and
publicly
stated
and
long-held
religious
beliefs
of
the
university.
that’s
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
well,
alright.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
i
don’t
believe
there's
any
question
but
what
the
irs
can
apply
the
laws
of
deductibility
retroactively,
they
don’t
have
to
do
it
but
i
believe
they
have
the
authority
to
do
it.
i
believe
the
court
have
so
held
in
many
cases.
and
the
irs
has
done
it
on
occasions.
this
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
--
field
that
even
if
williams
packing
is
the
law,
even
if
it
applies
to
exempt
organizations
that
we
come
within
williams
packing.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
held
that
we
had
irreparable
entry.
that
we
would
lo
--
loose
deductions
which
we
could
never
recover
and
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that
--
that’s
right.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no
--
no
question
about
that.
but
in
addition
we
feel
that
we
meet
the
other
test.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
government
can
prevail
ultimately
in
this
case.
and
our
feeling
for
that
is
because
the
action
of
the
irs
in
effect
is
an
attempt
to
place
a
tax
upon
the
exercise
of
a
religious
belief.
it’s
an
exaction
upon
religious
belief
which
we
feel
runs
absolutely
contrary
to
sherbet
against
verner,
which
runs
contrary
to
murdock
against
pennsylvania,
which
runs
con
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
well,
sir,
i
don’t
believe
we
are
an
establishment
and
i
don’t
believe
that
the
tax
exempt
status
put
a
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
well,
sir,
i
believe
it
--
this
court
said
it
was
a
action
of
benevolent
neutrality
and
the
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
to
say
that’s
it’s
not
a
substantial
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
sir?
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
yes,
sir
but
the
opinion
also
discusses
income
tax
and
says
its
in
the
same
category
and
i’ll
admit
that
the
amount
involved
will
be
considerably
different
as
well
as
income
tax
and
property
tax
is
concerned
but
its
still
a
question
of
the
benevolent
neutrality
in
wallace
case,
we
think
and
its
an
attempt
to
tax
the
exercise
of
the
religious
belief
which
we
feel
is
violate
-
is
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
and
the
government
cannot
ultimately
prevail
on
the
merits.
if
we
prevail
on
the
merits
and
our
deductibility
has
been
withdrawn
two
to
three
years,
we
have
lost
all
the
donations
that
we
would've
gotten
during
that
period
of
time.
there
are
serious
matters
as
long
we
are
concern.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
well,
the
original
bob
jones
was
the
founder
of
the
university.
he
died
at
the
age
of
some
85,
three
or
four
years
ago.
his
son,
bob
jones,
jr.
was
the
president
of
the
university
until
his
father’s
death
and
at
his
father’s
death,
his
son,
bob
jones,
iii
is
the
president
of
the
university.
that’s
it.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
named
after
the
founder.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
since
about
1927
or
(voice
overlap).
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
of
course
on
certiorari
to
the
fourth
court
of
appeals.
we
represent
bob
jones
university
which
is
a
unique
university.
it
has
a
slogan,
“the
world’s
most
unusual
university.”
i
think
it
can
safely
be
said
that
that
is
true.
it
is
a
university
which
has
deep
religious
backgrounds,
deep
religious
roots.
its
--
every
class
is
opened
and
closed
with
prayer.
the
university
admission’s
policy
requires
an
examination
into
the
religious
beliefs
of
those
who
apply
and
who
are
admitted.
one
of
the
religious
beliefs
of
the
university
is
that
the
scriptures
prohibit
the
intermarriage
of
the
races
and
that
it
would
be
scripturally
wrong
for
members
of
different
races
to
marry.
based
upon
that
religious
belief
which
has
been
its
belief
since
the
commencement
of
the
university
in
1927,
i
believe,
it
has
refused
admissions
to
blacks.
it
has
admitted
a
few
orientals
under
a
rule
that
says
those
who
are
admitted
cannot
date
members
of
other
races
while
at
the
university.
the
university
feels
that
at
the
college
level
is
when
most
romantic
attachments
are
formed
between
parties
and
when
their
life’s
partners
are
frequently
chosen.
for
that
reason,
it
has
adhered
to
the
policy
that
no
blacks
are
admitted
to
the
university.
now,
certainly
since
1942,
the
university
has
been
an
exempt
organization
under
the
provisions
of
501
(c)
(3).
it
has
met
all
the
requirements
of
501
(c)
(3)
as
set
forth
by
congress.
those
requirements
are
briefly
that
the
organization
be
one
who’s
chief
activity
is
religious,
educational,
or
charitable
that
its
operations
in
europe
to
the
private
profit
of
no
one
and
that
it
not
engage
in
any
substantial
lobbying
activities.
there's
never
been
any
question
but
at
bob
jones
university,
it
met
all
of
those
requirements.
in
the
letter
from
the
collector
in
1943
or
42,
it
was
stated
that
it
was
entitled
to
a
tax
exempt
status
and
that
such
tax
exempt
status
would
continue
unless
there
was
some
change
in
the
operations
of
the
university.
there
has
been
no
change
in
the
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
we
are
sure
they
had
tax
exempt
status
from
the
founding
but
we
have
not
been
able
to
trace
that
out.
we
have
the
first
and
only
thing
that
we
find
in
the
record
of
the
university
is
the
1942
letter
from
the
district
collector
of
internal
revenue
at
that
time.
it
operated
in
the
same
manner
from
its
inception
until
1942.
and
1942
was
no
different
in
the
other
year.
we
just
don’t
have
any
proof
that
they
were
recognized
as
exempt
by
the
internal
revenue
service
prior
to
1942.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
they
--
the
exact
time
when
it
begun,
i
do
not
know.
they
--
of
course
501
(c)
(3)
was
--
has
a
history
of
about
60
years
or
so.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
and
--
but
when
the
advance
letters
or
assurance
of
deductibility
was
instituted,
i
cannot
say
it
has
been
a
practice
for
many,
many
years
certainly
since
1942.
and
when
an
organization
receives
such
a
letter,
it
is
entitled
to
be
listed
in
the
cumulative
index
of
such
organization.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
i
think
that’s
true
and
i
think
it
did
receive
such
treatment.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
i
think
that’s
true,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no
question
about
it.
it’s
a
great
benefit
and
it’s
a
privilege,
i
understand
that.
it’s
a
thing
that
an
organization
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
exactly
(voice
overlap)
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
very
true
and
while
the
individual
donors
don’t
perhaps
check
it
too
much,
certainly
foundations
do
because
if
they
make
one
contribution
to
an
unauthorized
or
non-exempt
organization,
there
deductibility
would
be
withdrawn
or
probably
would
be
withdrawn
so
it’s
a
vital
importance
to
the
foundations
and
such
organizations
as
that.
our
record
shows
correspondence
between
us
and
the
nationwide
foundation,
the
insurance
company
in
ohio
where
they
had
been
making
matching
grants
and
where
they
--
in
view
of
the
questionable
status
of
the
university
refused
to
make
anymore
matching
grants.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
oh,
yes.
well,
i
think
that’s
right.
i
don’t
think
you
can
get
on
the
list
without
the
letter.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
yes,
sir.
it’s
of
estimable
benefit
to
an
organization
which
is
a
non-profit
organization
which
can
exist
only
through
donations
of
those
who
are
impelled
to
give
to
that
organization.
there
is,
of
course,
no
requirement
that
anyone
give
an
exempt
organization.
it’s
a
matter
of
personal
preference
and
choice
for
each
person
that
happens
to
give.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
i
think
that’s
correct,
yes
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
correct,
sir.
that
would
be
true.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
if
there
had
been
no
letter.
if
there
had
been
no
cumulative
index
or
listing,
i
think
no,
i
think
not.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
well
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
correct.
being
on
the
list
is
a
vital
importance
because
donors
will
presumably
--
well,
actually
we
know,
they
won’t
yield
it
if
they
are
not.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
well
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
if
we
ask
for
a
mandatory
injunction,
the
defense
of
sovereign
immunity
might
apply
which
it
doesn’t
in
this
case
because
we
ask
for
no
affirmative
relief
against
any
office
of
the
united
states.
we
ask
merely
for
an
injunction.
that’s
the
only
difference
that
concurs
to
me.
that
is
a
defense
that
the
government
pleaded
in
this
case
and
advanced
in
the
district
level
but
now
concedes
as
inapplicable
to
this
particular
case
and
not
from
the
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no,
sir.
it
has
not
been
withdrawn.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
right,
sir.
the
district
court
of
course
issued
the
injunction.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
but
the
advance
assurance
of
deductibility
has
not
been
withdrawn.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no
sir.
there
was
no
stay
outstanding.
we
applied
for
a
stay
and
the
court
did
not
see
fit
to
grant
it.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
i
think
that’s
right.
it
was
revoked
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
well,
our
deductions,
our
contributions,
it
fallen
off
some,
i
would
not
say
that
they
have
dried
up
but
as
long
as
we
have
that
assurance
of
the
advance
assurance
as
they
have
not
dried
up
and
we
have
not
suffered
the
irreparable
harm
that
we
would
have
suffered
had
not
the
district
court
originally
granted
the
injunction.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
it’s
a
practice
by
the
commissioner.
there
is
no
statutory
justification
point
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
we
are
on
the
so-called
list,
yes
sir.
i
don’t
think
we
would've
been
on
the
so-called
list
had
we
not
had
the
letter
to
start
with.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
correct
sir,
it
is.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that
--
that’s
correct
and
while
as
i
say,
as
i've
said
a
few
minutes
ago,
the
individual
donors,
of
small
individual
donors,
i
don’t
think
that
would
make
a
lot
of
difference.
it
does
make
a
lot
of
difference
to
foundations.
i
think
that’s
where
the
real
damage
came
as
a
result
of
the
announcement
of
the
irs
that
it
would
be
withdrawn.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
i
think
that’s
correct,
yes
sir.
i
think
other
possible
donors
would
approach
it
with
caution
and
i
think
the
donors
that
have
given
an
interim
or
people
who
were
firmly
motivated
to
give
and
who
are
not
altogether
swayed
by
the
deductibility
of
their
contributions.
but
as
i
say,
donations
and
contributions
have
been
much
less
free
as
it
were
before.
now
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
it
would
--
we
would
come
into
to
play.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
correct
sir.
that’s
correct.
that’s
a
vital
importance
of
the
foundation
not
give
any
gift
to
anyone
whose
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
--
eligibility
on
the
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
--
501
(c)
(3)
is
in
debt.
at
any
rate,
this
announcement
from
the
irs
to
the
effect
that
the
irs
could
no
longer
grant
advance
assurance
of
deductibility
to
schools
who
practice
a
racially,
discriminatory
policy
no
matter
why
they
had
that
policy
resulted
in
this
lawsuit.
there
was
no
act
of
congress
that
aided
that
provision
to
501
(c)
(3)
as
one
of
the
conditions
for
an
exempt
organization.
congress
had
very
specifically
set
forth
what
was
necessary
to
be
an
exempt
organization
and
that
didn’t
happen
to
be
one
of
the
requirements
that
was
set
forth.
at
any
rate,
and
it’s
our
contention
and
the
lower
court
held
that
the
commissioner
exceeded
the
statutory
authority
given
him
that
he
has
authority
to
promulgate
regulations
but
not
to
change
law
and
that
that’s
a
matter
for
congress
to
decide
and
we
of
course
contend
that
that’s
absolutely
correct.
now,
it’s
our
--
we
must
concede
that
bob
jones
university
has
a
remedy
at
law.
bob
jones
university,
if
its
exempt
status
is
destroyed,
will
be
in
a
position
where
it
will
have
to
pay
not
only
unemployment
taxes
but
income
taxes
as
well.
and
we
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
on
the
income
from
operating
the
university
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
tuition
and
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
yes.
well,
i
think
it
is
one
of
the
universities
i
have
said
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
yes
sir.
but
this
university
as
i
said
as
the
world’s
most
unusual
university
and
it
has
made
a
profit
which
has
been
applied
back
into
plant
and
other
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no,
not
bothered
about
depreciation.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
they
haven’t
been
bothered
by
depreciation.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
we
have
been
exempt
so
why
bother
with
depreciation?
their
have
bookkeeping
procedures
have
not
--
the
auditors
have
not
bothered
with
depreciation
at
all
because
depreciation
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no
question
about
that
and
perhaps
they
would
not
be
as
substantial
as
we
think
but
we
would
still
have
to
pay
them
and
that
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
tuition,
room
and
board.
the
operation
of
the
student
center
and
those
things
where
they
sell
drinks
and
soft
drinks,
i
might
add
--[laughter]
--
to
the
students
and
faculty.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
not
an
inter
--
interscholastic.
they
do
have
intramural
athletics.
they
have
a
(voice

--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no,
no,
no
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
well
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
correct.
they
do
have
investments
which
they
have
realize
income
from.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
at
any
rate
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
i
don’t
think
there's
any
question
about
that?
its
--
the
record
so
says
and
i
don’t
think
there's
ever
been
any
question
but
what
it
is,
an
organization
operated
not
to
anyone’s
individual
profit.
it
inures
to
the
profit
of
no
individual.
the
university
is
--
believes
it
caused
it
some
detriment.
it
could
not
contentiously
sign
the
certificate
of
compliance
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
and
therefore
it
voluntarily
has
foregone
all
grants
of
any
kind
or
nature.
it
received
no
grants
of
any
kind
or
nature
from
the
federal
government,
any
branch
of
the
federal
government
or
any
branch
of
the
state
government.
it
absolutely
goes
it
on
its
own
with
its
own
operation
and
its
own
donors.
it
has
no
gifts
or
grants
of
any
kind
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
the
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
3,500
and
a
faculty
of
about
650.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no
graduate,
all
undergraduate.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
we
--
that
substantially
is
what
this
case
is
your
honor
except,
we
have
the
letter
and
we
have
this
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
against
the
withdrawal
of
the
exempt
status
of
bob
jones
university.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
wouldn’t
think
so.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
because
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
it
--
as
the
district
court
said
in
this
case,
it
involved
taxes
only
very
remotely.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
under
the
literal
times
of
the
injunction
statute,
any
case
involving
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
i
agree
that
it
would
be
barred
by
the
anti-injunction
statute
with
no
court
rule
such
as
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
the
difference
in
that
and
this
is
that
the
university
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
yes.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
for
one
thing,
prospective
donors
without
the
letter,
without
the
listing
would
not
be
inclined
to
donate.
i
think
that
is
the
big
difference.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
as
to
the
anti-injunction
statute,
i
don’t
suppose
there
is
too
much
difference
in
the
two
situations
except
that
without
the
letter
and
without
the
advance
assurance
of
deductibility,
we
would've
been
paying
taxes
and
our
donors
would've
not
have
been
--
would
not
have
been
entitled
to
deductions
from
their
income.
at
any
rate,
if
we
read
the
terms
of
the
anti-injunction
statute
literally,
there
is
no
exception,
there
is
no
exception.
this
court
has
recognized
that
there
are
exceptions.
it
created
exceptions.
in
the
hill
case,
hill
against
wallace,
it
created
exceptions.
in
miller
against
standard
nut
margarine
and
it
created
an
exception
and
enochs
against
williams
packing.
now
the
government
suggested
if
the
rule
in
enochs
against
williams
packing
is
to
be
changed
that
it
should
be
by
the
legislature
rather
than
by
the
court,
i
respectfully
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
rule
of
enochs
against
williams
packing
is
not
a
legislative
rule,
it’s
a
court
originated
rule.
it’s
a
rule
that
the
legislature
had
nothing
to
do
with
but
the
court
in
(inaudible)
power
to
do
justice
between
the
government
and
the
citizens
evolve
the
rule
in
enochs
against
williams.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that
in
effect
is
correct
but
we
abide
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that
--
that’s
right.
that’s
right,
sir.
the
ruling
is
what
we
are
vitally
concerned
about
plus
the
publication
of
that
ruling.
if
the
ruling
is
made
in
a
vacuum,
if
it
is
not
publicized,
if
the
donors
don’t
know
about
the
ruling
and
we
can’t
get
it
to
him
in
any
effective
way,
then
of
course,
we
are
concerned
about
it.
we
are
concern
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
well,
well,
that’s
right.
and
the
ruling
issue
does
have
the
right
contents
and
we
are
listed
in
the
cumulative
index
of
the
--
list
of
exempt
organizations.
we
are
listed
there
and
it
is
a
benefit
to
the
university.
the
position
of
the
university
really
is
that
the
rule
in
enochs
against
williams
packing
has
no
real
application
to
exempt
organizations
as
was
pointed
out
in
one
of
the
previous
arguments.
the
--
any
injunction
statute
was
passed
in
1867
long
before
we
had
any
question
about
exempt
organizations,
charitable
deductions,
or
income
tax
for
that
matter.
and
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no.
no
question
about
that
your
honor.
it
does
apply
to
income
taxes
and
it
does
apply
to
exempt
organizations
as
the
irs
attempts
to
enforce
it
but
we
think
that
as
far
as
exempt
organizations
are
concerned
who
--
source
of
revenue
can
be
dried
up
by
a
mere
withdrawing
of
that
advance
assurance
of
deductibility
who
can
face
one
as
a
--
the
amici
brief
in
the
americans
united
case
pointed
out
and
it’s
a
matter
that
mr.
thrall
who
was
commissioner
at
the
time,
made
a
speech
in
dallas,
have
said,
“we
understand
and
realize
that
our
mere
refusal
to
rule
on
an
application
can
doom
an
organization
that
under
those
circumstances,
under
those
circumstances,
a
different
rule
than
the
one
applied
in
williams
packing
should
be
adopted.”
obviously,
williams
packing
goes
a
long
ways
to
protect
the
internal
revenue
service
and
the
receipt
of
the
government
revenues
and
obviously
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no,
that’s
right.
the
statute
went
that
far.
it
went
farther
but
i
think
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
right.
it
certainly
did.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no,
sir.
i’m
asking
the
court
to
exercise
and
hear
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
to
fall
--
fashion
a
remedy
that
would
be
fair
and
applicable
to
the
internal
revenue
service
and
to
the
charitable
or
exempt
organizations.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that’s
correct
sir.
and
the
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that
--
that’s
correct
your
honor.
and
i
don’t
think
that
involves
a
question
of
assessment
or
collection
of
a
tax
against
bob
jones
university
as
is
apparent
from
the
record
in
this
case.
bob
jones
university
can
pay
every
tax
that
the
government
intends
to
assess
and
collect
against
it
by
purely
and
simply
abandon
its
religious
convictions
and
changing
its
admissions
policy.
the
record
is
clear
from
the
deposition
of
mr.
connick
(ph),
the
assistant
collector
of
internal
revenue
in
charge
of
exempt
organizations
to
the
effect
that,
if
bob
jones
university
changes
its
admissions
policy,
we
would
not
revoke
its
advance
assurance
of
deductibility.
so,
really
we
are
not
talking,
in
my
opinion,
we’re
not
talking
about
taxes.
we
are
talking
about
as
mr.
crampton
remarked
in
the
previous
case,
some
people
try
to
use
the
internal
revenue
service
as
a
club
against
those
that
they
don’t
like
or
with
whom
they
have
differences.
we’re
attempting
to
keep
the
internal
revenue
service
from
using
the
club
of
withdrawing
our
advance
assurance
of
deductibility
to
adopt
an
admissions
policy
which
is
not
dictated
by
any
act
of
congress
on
admission
policy
which
is
contrary
to
the
firm
and
publicly
stated
and
long-held
religious
beliefs
of
the
university.
that’s
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
well,
alright.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
i
don’t
believe
there's
any
question
but
what
the
irs
can
apply
the
laws
of
deductibility
retroactively,
they
don’t
have
to
do
it
but
i
believe
they
have
the
authority
to
do
it.
i
believe
the
court
have
so
held
in
many
cases.
and
the
irs
has
done
it
on
occasions.
this
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
--
field
that
even
if
williams
packing
is
the
law,
even
if
it
applies
to
exempt
organizations
that
we
come
within
williams
packing.
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
held
that
we
had
irreparable
entry.
that
we
would
lo
--
loose
deductions
which
we
could
never
recover
and
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
that
--
that’s
right.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
no
--
no
question
about
that.
but
in
addition
we
feel
that
we
meet
the
other
test.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
government
can
prevail
ultimately
in
this
case.
and
our
feeling
for
that
is
because
the
action
of
the
irs
in
effect
is
an
attempt
to
place
a
tax
upon
the
exercise
of
a
religious
belief.
it’s
an
exaction
upon
religious
belief
which
we
feel
runs
absolutely
contrary
to
sherbet
against
verner,
which
runs
contrary
to
murdock
against
pennsylvania,
which
runs
con
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
well,
sir,
i
don’t
believe
we
are
an
establishment
and
i
don’t
believe
that
the
tax
exempt
status
put
a
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
well,
sir,
i
believe
it
--
this
court
said
it
was
a
action
of
benevolent
neutrality
and
the
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
to
say
that’s
it’s
not
a
substantial
--
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
sir?
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
yes,
sir
but
the
opinion
also
discusses
income
tax
and
says
its
in
the
same
category
and
i’ll
admit
that
the
amount
involved
will
be
considerably
different
as
well
as
income
tax
and
property
tax
is
concerned
but
its
still
a
question
of
the
benevolent
neutrality
in
wallace
case,
we
think
and
its
an
attempt
to
tax
the
exercise
of
the
religious
belief
which
we
feel
is
violate
-
is
in
violation
of
the
first
amendment
of
the
constitution
and
the
government
cannot
ultimately
prevail
on
the
merits.
if
we
prevail
on
the
merits
and
our
deductibility
has
been
withdrawn
two
to
three
years,
we
have
lost
all
the
donations
that
we
would've
gotten
during
that
period
of
time.
there
are
serious
matters
as
long
we
are
concern.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
well,
the
original
bob
jones
was
the
founder
of
the
university.
he
died
at
the
age
of
some
85,
three
or
four
years
ago.
his
son,
bob
jones,
jr.
was
the
president
of
the
university
until
his
father’s
death
and
at
his
father’s
death,
his
son,
bob
jones,
iii
is
the
president
of
the
university.
that’s
it.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
named
after
the
founder.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
d.
todd,
jr.
since
about
1927
or
