unknown
speaker
it’s
sort
of
like
one
litigant
having
litigated
with
the
irs
and
lost.
one
donor
has
litigated
his
tax
return
to
the
irs
as
loss.
other
litigants,
other
possible
donors
are
going
to
be
put
off
a
little.
unknown
speaker
income
taxes
on
what?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
the
tuitions,
you
mean
on
that?
unknown
speaker
they’ll
make
a
profit
--
yes.
unknown
speaker
that’s
pretty
hard
to
do,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
after
--
after
actually
after
depreciation?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
didn’t
think
they
had.
unknown
speaker
well,
haven’t
you
made
the
--
some
reference
somewhere
along
here
that
your
income
taxes
would
be
very
substantial?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
know
that
in
view
of
what
you’ve
just
said
about
not
using
depreciation
and
the
like?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
you
say
your
income
taxes
“would
be
substantial.”
unknown
speaker
if
you
had
to
go
about
filing
an
income
tax
return,
you
certainly
are
going
to
start
taking
account
of
depreciation.
unknown
speaker
of
what
does
your
income
consist
beside
tuition,
certainly
not
your
donations,
your
contributions
are
not
income?
unknown
speaker
and
athletic
program?
unknown
speaker
but
nothing
that
earns
money
in
the
stadium
or
anything?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
you
have
a
--
you'd
be
very
unusual
if
you
didn’t
have
investments
on
which
you
had
income?
unknown
speaker
any
private
institution
that
i
know
of
learning
and
i
am
familiar
with
has,
they
never
have
enough
but
they
have
--
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
size
of
the
student
party?
unknown
speaker
and
all
undergraduate?
no
graduate
school?
unknown
speaker
that’s
the
practice,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
isn’t
what
i
asked
you,
whether
it’s
legally
permissible
as
what
mr.
justice
--
do
you
think
it’s
legally
--
would
it
be
legally
permissible
for
them
to
go
back
and
attempt
to
litigate
a
deduction
for
a
prior
year
that
a
donor
had
taken?
unknown
speaker
this
was
with
respect
to
an
organization
on
the
list.
unknown
speaker
there
are
cases
that
say
it
does
not,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
and
certainly
the
service
has
been
known
to
change
its
mind?
unknown
speaker
let’s
make
it
specific
--
suppose
a
taxpayer
asserts
a
deduction
that
he
made
to
bob
jones
university
in
1973,
and
in
’73
returned
yet
to
be
filed.
this
took
place
since
the
court
of
appeals’
ruling.
i
take
it
down
the
service
fields,
it
cannot
challenge
that
deduction
because
it’s
--
the
university
is
still
on
the
list.
unknown
speaker
i’m
just
looking
at
the
injunction,
where
is
it?
unknown
speaker
you
are
hereby
enjoined
(inaudible)
from
revoking
or
threatening
to
revoke
the
tax
exempt
status
of
the
plaintiff
and
further
enjoined
(inaudible)
withdrawing
advance
assurance
deductibility
of
contributions
solely
because
the
admissions
policy
of
the
plaintiff
pending
a
final
hearing,
determination
of
this
cause
and
theirs.
and
you
have
the
feeling,
at
least
are
operating
under
the
impression
that
that
injunction
still
extend
against
the
service,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
and
why
is
that
--
it
was
reversed
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
there
isn’t
any
in
terms
of
outstanding,
is
there
really?
unknown
speaker
in
the
reversal?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
was
the
court
of
appeals’
reversal,
how
is
it
an
injunction?
unknown
speaker
and
state
reversal?
unknown
speaker
i
would
think
the
district
court’s
perhaps
read
it,
it’s
out
of
its
--
unknown
speaker
--
its
out
of
here
jurisdiction
but
that’s
within
the
jurisdiction
of
another
court
that
they
reversed
it.
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not
you
can,
you
have
it?
unknown
speaker
but
you
can’t
--
quite
apart
from
any
statute,
you
--
there
can’t
even
be
an
injunction
unless
there
is
an
irreparable
injury.
i
mean,
if
that
were
the
only
--
unknown
speaker
--
test,
well,
there
wouldn’t
be
--
need
to
be
any
statute
because
that’s
a
well-known
and
well
settled
equitable
doctrine.
unknown
speaker
or
maybe
granting
a
--
maybe
doing
this
as
an
establishment.
unknown
speaker
but
it’s
a
substantial
benefit
the
government’s
conferring
on,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
it
was
a
--
unknown
speaker
it’s
a
property
tax.
unknown
speaker
that
was
property
tax.
that’s
was
an
exemption.
unknown
speaker
who
is
the
--
and
this
is
pure
curiosity,
who
was
the
--
who
is
or
was
the
bob
jones
after
whom
this
university
was
named?
unknown
speaker
it’s
named
after
the
founder
in
other
words.
unknown
speaker
it’s
sort
of
like
one
litigant
having
litigated

unknown
speaker

taxes
on
what?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
the
tuitions,
you
mean
on
that?
unknown
speaker
they’ll
make
a
profit
--
yes.
unknown
speaker
that’s
pretty
hard
to
do,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
