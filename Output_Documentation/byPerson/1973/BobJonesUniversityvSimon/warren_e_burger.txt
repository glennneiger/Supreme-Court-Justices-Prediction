mr.
todd,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
you
would
agree
that
the
practice
of
issuing
the
letter
is
beneficial
to
the
recipients
of
these
contributions.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
it
clears
is
the
importance;
i
suppose
is
that
it
clears
the
air
and
removes
any
doubt
from
the
part
of
donors.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
hope
the
donor
will
ask
his
lawyer,
are
they
--
will
this
be
deductible
and
it’s
a
very
simple
matter
for
the
lawyer
to
find
out
now,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
is
obviously
as
an
institution,
as
a
corporate
entity
organized
not
for
profit,
isn’t
it
--
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
really
then,
it
seem
to
me
not
the
letters
or
the
list
that
you're
concerned
about
but
the
letter
and
the
list
represent,
that
is,
the
letter
and
the
list
are
merely
declarative,
one
is
a
private
communication
and
the
other
is
a
public
communication
stating
what
is
the
legal
ruling
of
irs,
is
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
it’s
the
rules,
it’s
the
rules
that
you're
--
the
ruling
that
you're
concerned
about,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
said
earlier
that
the
ruling
--
the
publication
and
the
letter
are
beneficial.
they're
beneficial
i
suppose,
you
mean
or
meant
to
say,
they're
beneficial
if
they
have
the
right
contents.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
todd,
you're

four
minutes

so
if
you
want
to
save
some
rebuttal
time

chief
justice

burger

you
need
to
do
that.
mr.
crampton.
chief
justice
warren
e.

this
is
a
--
if
nothing
else,
as
you

at

a
matter
deference
to
the
importance
of
the
problem
or
that’s
pending
in
the
courts.
chief
