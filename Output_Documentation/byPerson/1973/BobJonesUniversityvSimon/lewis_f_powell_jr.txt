the
first
of
these,
bob
jones
against
simon,
is
a
case
that
involves
the
application
of
the
anti-injunction
act
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
internal
revenue
service
has
a
ruling
letter
program,
pursuant
to
which
organizations
deemed
entitled
the
tax
exempt
status
are
identified.
if
an
organization
is
on
the
tax
exempt
list,
published
periodically
by
the
service,
contribution
for
donors
to
the
organizations
are
deductible
under
section
170
of
the
code.
petitioner,
a
private
university,
was
notified
by
the
service
that
its
tax
exempt
status
would
be
revoked
because
of
racial
discriminatory
admission
policies.
in
addition
to
affecting
donors,
revocation
would
result
in
petitioner
paying
income
and
other
taxes.
this
suit
was
brought
to
enjoin
the
service
from
revoking
a
previously
issued
favorable
ruling
letter.
the
anti-injunction
act
provides
that
no
suit
for
the
purpose
of
restraining
the
assessment
or
collection
of
any
tax
shall
be
maintained
in
any
court.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
the
act
precludes
injunctive
relief.
we
affirm
this
judgment.
in
doing
so,
we’re
not
unmindful
of
the
harshness
of
a
procedures
which
allows
withdrawal
and
the
tax
exempt
status
without
a
prior
adjudication
of
a
correctness
of
a
proposed
withdrawal.
in
this
and
similar
cases,
such
an
action
by
the
service
may
result
in
irreparable
laws
to
an
organization
largely
dependent
upon
contribution
from
donors.
but
we
are
constrained
by
the
explicit
language
of
the
act.

being
appropriate,
