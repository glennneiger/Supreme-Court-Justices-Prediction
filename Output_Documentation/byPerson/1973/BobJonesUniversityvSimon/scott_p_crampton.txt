mr.
scott
p.
crampton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
i
think
that
the
fundamental
procedure
issue
is
the
same
and
i
think
that
the
--
this
case
perhaps
even
--
more
strongly
emphasizes
the
need
for
the
application
of
the
injunction
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
(c)
(4)
is
not
in
this
case.
its
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
oh,
yes.
the
other
one
was
exempt
under
501
(c)
(4)
in
americans
united.
so
this
one
is
--
we
--
is
not
exempt
under
501
(c)
(4).
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
and
the
questions
whether
to
exempt
under
501
(c)
(3)
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
our
position,
that’s
the
position
the
commissioner
probably
would
take,
i
say
it,
there
were
certain
administrative
seps
--
steps
that
were
still
to
be
explored
but
the
injunction
stopped
all
that.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
but
a
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
right.
and
that’s
the
point
i’d
like
to
make
here.
i
was
somewhat
shocked
as
i
think
mr.
justice
white
indicated
this
tax
apparent
not
only
was
making
money.
the
accountant
who
would
handle
its
records
for
some
25
years
has
filed
here
in
an
affidavit
saying
that
this
corporation
would
owe
$750,000.00
in
tax
for
one
year
and
$500,000.00
in
tax
for
another
year
simply
income
tax.
and
the
purpose
of
this
act
is
to
stop
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
from
attempting
to
assess
that
and
i
say
this
comes
in
squarely
under
the
taxpayers
is
trying
to
stop
the
assessment
of
tax
and
the
williams
packing
case
--
the
exceptions
in
the
williams
packing
case
do
not
apply
here.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
--
there's
no
question
but
what
--
there
is
a
chance
here
of
the
commissioner
prevailing
so
that
possibility
is
a
--
would
not
exude.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
[laughter]
i’m
not
sure
either.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
(voice
overlap)
we’re
looking
at
it
on
the
--
you
first
asked
this
question,
there
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
i
didn’t
find
it
but
i
did
find
that
there
is
a
--
we
have
cited
in
the
briefs
and
a
historical
review
of
this
ruling
process,
its
in
one
of
the
new
york
university
institute,
tax
institutes
and
an
article
that
was
prepared
by
former
commissioner
of
internal
revenue,
mortimer
caplin.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
and
i
don’t
have
that
with
me,
but
i
think
that
will
answer
that.
my
recollection
is
that
it
must
go
back
into
the
20’s
anyway
but
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
thought
--
i
believe
that
was
changed
by
a
statute
awhile
back.
you
can
come
in
and
make
a
preliminary
showing
of
what
you
plan
to
do
and
then
as
i
recall,
you
commend
with
a
sort
of
a
follow-up
situation,
say,
we
did
do
it
but
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that
used
to
be
the
case.
i’m
not
sure
whether
that’s
true
anymore.
i
don’t
--
i
didn’t
think
it
had.
i
wanted
to
answer
a
question
that
was
asked
before
about
whether
or
not
this
injunction
had
been
revoked.
it
has
not.
the
district
court
entered
the
injunction
and
when
it
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
there
was
an
application
for
a
stay
after
the
court
of
appeals
handed
down
its
opinion.
that
was
denied
and
then
when
it
went
--
the
matter
got
back
to
the
district
court,
a
petition
for
certiorari
had
been
filed,
it
was
the
position
of
the
district
court
that
it
no
longer
had
jurisdiction
and
therefore
as
it
stands
now,
if
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
attempted
to
do
anything,
he
would
run
the
risk
of
being
in
contempt
of
court.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right.
yes,
it
hasn’t
been
and
so
this
folks
have
been
having
an
advantage
for
three
years
that
this
has
been
pending
of
being
able
to
remain
on
the
list
and
get
the
benefit
of
the
tax
exempt
dollars
from
their
donors.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i’m
through.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
i
mean
anything
in
the
contrary
to
the
injunction
order.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
oh,
not
for
our
previous
year
because
they’d
been
on
the
list
and
under
that
list,
any
donor
could
look
to
that
list
and
that’s
his
license
so
to
speak
to
make
a
contribution.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
i
think
the
internal
revenue
services
sort
of
held
out;
you
think
that’s
estoppel?
i
would
think
so.
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
poor
tax
administration
(voice
overlap).
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
after
they
had
in
effect
held
out
to
the
donor
that
if
he
relied
on
that
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
i
think
estoppel
would
play
there.
there’d
be
a
reliance
on
an
act
to
a
detriment
of
the
--
now,
whether
a
estoppel
goes
against
the
government,
you'd
get
into
a
difference
--
perhaps
a
little
different
set
of
rules
but
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes
there
are.
and
that’s
why
i
kind
of
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
but
i
don’t
think
you
have
found
the
service
changing
its
mind
with
respect
to
rulings
when
they
have
been
made
and
under
such
circumstances,
the
taxpayers
were
entitled
to
rely
on
them.
that
is,
the
service
has
issued
rulings,
will
say
to
taxpayer
a
and
then
when
taxpayer
b
comes
in,
they
said,
“no,
we’ve
changed
our
mind.”
but
they
still
will
not
go
back
and
assess
the
deficiency
against
taxpayer
a
who
may
have
acted
in
reliance
on
that
ruling
under,
maybe
a
corporate
reorganization
or
something
of
that
nature.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that
would
be
my
position
and
i
have
taken
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
at
page
1
--
8128.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes
and
they
came
to
this
court
for
a
stay
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
burger
denied
the
stay
and
went
back
to
the
--
mr.
chief
justice
burger,
went
down
and
say,
went
back
to
the
lower
court
and
by
that
time
it
was
in
the
supreme
court
in
a
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
district
court
said,
we
know,
i
feel
i
no
longer
have
jurisdiction
so
he
refused
to
revoke
the
order
which
he
had
entered.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
that’s
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
what?
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
this
is
the
position
the
district
court
took.
but
the
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
yes.
i
believe
it
did.
but
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
out
of
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
well,
anyway,
it’s
a
practical
matter,
we
have
--
the
commissioner
hasn’t
done
anything
and
--
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
we
have
it.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
that’s
right
and
that’s
why
we
are
here
hoping
that
this
court
will
give
us
some
guidance
that
we
can
use
and
i
say
we’ve
had
a
multitude
of
these
cases
coming
along.
we
feel
the
proper
role
of
this
injunction
procedure
is
a
very
important
one
in
the
administration
of
the
tax
laws
and
the
--
we
think
that
the
remedy
here
is
legislation
and
it
is
not
allowance
of
injunctions
because
i
think
we’re
--
as
i
have
indicated
earlier
that
will
only
lead
to
chaos.
i
think
i
have
covered
the
point.
i
hope
the
court
put
a
little
time
and
yield
it
now.
[laughter]
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
scott
p.
crampton
no,
i
