justice
potter
stewart
what
was
the
situation
between
1927,
the
date
of
its
founding
and
1942,
was
it
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
the
date
of
the
letter?
justice
potter
stewart
when
did
this
practice
of
issuing
letters
such
as
these
begin
in
the
department
that
they're
not
authorize
or
re
--
recognized
by
any
statutes
that
i
know
of?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
now
even
before
it
receives
such
a
letter,
that’s
just
as
you’ve
suggested
it.
it
probably,
you
say
it’s
been
operating
exactly
the
same
way
or
certainly
was
exact
--
operating
exactly
the
same
way
with
the
same
policies
from
1927
up
through
1942
and
beyond
so
presumably
without
a
letter
it
was
entitled
to
exactly
the
same
tax
treatment
prior
to
1942,
wasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
and
the
--
and
that
its
benefactors
also
had
their
gifts
deductible
from
their
ordinary
income
for
tax
purposes
prior
to
1942.
justice
potter
stewart
this
whole
practice
however
is
extracurricular,
extra-statutory,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
a
--
as
far
as
the
law
goes,
a
donation
is
deductible
from
a
donors
of
taxable
income
if
the
donee
meets
certain
statutory
requirements
period,
that
drives
us
of
any
letters
or
any
list.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
if
there’d
been
no
letter
in
this
case,
would
you
be
entitled
to
go
into
a
court
and
ask
for
an
injunction,
if
you
have
a
letter
issued
to
you?
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
you’d
be
on
the
same
position
you
are
now
because
you
wouldn’t
be
on
the
list.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say,
being
on
the
list
is
the
essential
qualification
for
you
to
maintain
a
viable
existence
as
bob
jones
university.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
so
its
and
i’m
assuming
you
had
no
letter
and
therefore
we’re
not
on
the
list
and
you
are
operating
just
as
you
have
operated
since
1927
and
right
up
through
1942,
would
you
be
entitled
in
your
view
to
go
into
a
federal
court
and
ask
for
injunction,
mandatory
injunction
requiring
a
commissioner
to
issue
you
a
letter,
that
you
are
tax
exempt
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
because
if
not
you'd
be
in
the
same
shape
you
are
now,
you
wouldn’t
be
on
the
list.
justice
potter
stewart
despite
the
lower
courts
order?
justice
potter
stewart
not
because
it’s
a
stay
outstanding
or
just
hasn’t?
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
service
simply
hasn’t
withdrawn
your
exemption,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you're
certainly
in
this
good
position
as
you
would
be
if
there
had
been
no
--
never
had
been
in
that
letter,
aren't
you?
the
fact
is,
you're
in
a
better
position
cause
as
of
now
you're
still
on
the
so-called
list.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
apparently
not.
but
if
you
hadn’t
had
the
letter,
you'd
be
in
the
just
as
bad
position
--
worst
position
than
you
are
now
from
the
point
of
view
of
attracting
the
beneficence
of
supporters
and
benefactors
(voice
overlap).
except
that
a
--
except
that
the
internal
revenue
service
by
revoking
your
--
purporting
to
revoke
your
clearance
has
in
advanced
announce
that
it
doesn’t
think
that
your
organization
qualifies.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
so
that
the
--
any
people
who
were
thinking
about
giving
money
to
you
know
they're
going
to
have
a
fight
on
their
hands.
justice
potter
stewart
you’ve
mentioned
the
foundations
a
couple
of
times,
do
i
understand
and
i
think
i
have
understood
that
if
a
gift
is
made
a
foundation
to
a
--
an
institution
that
is
not
--
that
does
not
qualify,
then
the
tax
status
of
the
foundation
itself
might
come
into
question
or
be
altered,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
unlike
individual
donors.
justice
potter
stewart
doesn’t
qualify
to
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
the
statute
going
up,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
and
--
but
even
went
farther,
didn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
what
--
you're
asking
us
to
repeal
the
statute,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
your
fundamental
aim
is
to
keep
your
letter
enforced
so
that
the
internal
revenue
service
according
to
its
usual
practice
would
be
forbidden
or
at
least
would
refrain
from
collecting
taxes
from
your
donors.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
the
heart
of
the
case
is
whether
the
internal
revenue
service
should
or
shouldn’t
be
permitted
to
collect
taxes
from
your
donors
based
on
their
gifts.
justice
potter
stewart
but
was
this
institution,
the
commissioner
would
probably
hold
was
itself
taxable
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
on
its
own,
that
income,
unlike
the
previous
case?
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
i
didn’t
mean
to
interrupt.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say,
as
the
commissioner
attempt
to
do
anything,
he
would
be
--
run
the
risk
of
being
in
contempt
of
court,
you
know
that’s
a
little
bit
broad.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
is
the
injunction?
or
is
it
in
the
appendix?
i
mean
in
other
words,
could
you
attempt
to
disallow
a
deduction
for
a
taxpayer
who
may
had
made
a
gift
in
some
previous
years
to
bob
jones
university
without
being
in
contempt?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
the
practice
but
its
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
what

the
