mr.
james
d.
tracy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
as
you
know
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
sixth
circuit.
that
court
affirmed
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
which
had
held
the
petitioner,
together
with
another
employer,
was
required
to
arbitrate
under
the
collective
bargaining
contract
of
the
other
employer.
actually,
there
were
two
other
employers
they
are
referred
to
in
the
brief
as
grissoms
and
because
there
were
several
names,
i
will
use
that
name
for
convenience.
the
issues
presented
are
of
whether
petitioner
is
a
successor
employer
as
that
term
is
used
as
a
term
of
art
in
labor
law,
and
whether
petitioner
is
required
to
arbitrate
grievances
presented
by
respondent
union
under
the
contract
between
respondent
union
and
the
other
employer,
the
grissoms.
the
case
arose
with
the
beginning
of
june
1972
when
petitioner,
howard
johnson
company
entered
into
an
agreement
with
his
other
employer
as
referred
to
as
grissoms,
under
which
it
was
to
buy
a
motel
and
a
restaurant
then
being
operated
by
the
grissoms
who
were
franchisees
of
the
howard
johnson
company.
that
agreement
provided
for
sale
of
certain
assets
in
the
motel
and
restaurant
and
for
leasing
of
property
on
which
they
stood.
it
did
not
provide
for
assumption
of
contracts
other
than
a
contract
with
respect
to
advertising.
on
july
9,
the
--
excuse
me
--
on
june
28,
the
howard
johnson
company
petitioner
notified
the
seller
that
it
would
not
assume
the
labor
contract
which
the
seller
had
with
respondent
union,
two
contracts
existed.
on
july
9,
the
other
employer
notified
its
employees
that
they
would
be
terminated
at
july
23.
on
july
13,
the
petitioner
notified
respondent
union
who
had
inquired
at
that
time
as
to
petitioner’s
intent
that
it
would
not
recognize
the
union
contract,
which
respondent
had
with
the
other
employer.
a
few
days
later,
the
petitioner
commenced
interviewing
prospective
employees.
it
put
advertisements
in
the
local
newspapers.
indeed,
it
put
a
sign
in
the
very
motel
and
restaurant
where
its
business
is
being
conducted,
saying
that
it
would
be
hiring
employees.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
there
was
no
stop,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
yes,
sir.
a
contract
ultimately
called
for
closing
at
12:01
am
and
the
testimony
is
--
and
this
was
put
in
on
stipulated
facts
but
the
record
is
clear
that
at
12
o’clock,
the
franchisee
discontinued
its
operations.]
mr.
james
d.
tracy
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
certainly
goes
to
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
a
successor
employer
and
i
will
certainly
discuss
that
issue
with
the
court.
the
petitioner
did
hire
employees.
it
hired
some
who
had
worked
for
this
predecessor
employer.
actually,
it
was
9
of
the
33
i
think
in
the
restaurant
and
none
of
approximately
12
in
the
motel.
it
had
a
complete
change
of
supervisory
employees;
none
of
the
supervisory
employees
of
the
predecessor
were
retained.
an
entire
new
supervisory
staff
was
brought
in.
the
employees
who
were
hired
prior
to
july
24,
the
date
on
which
the
transaction
was
closed,
were
trained
at
another
howard
johnson
facility
which
was
nearby.
and
thereafter,
on
july
24,
the
transaction
was
ready
for
closing
and
that
was
a
sunday
night
or
a
monday
morning,
but
on
the
friday
preceding
that,
respondent
union
brought
suit
in
state
court
seeking
an
injunction
against
what
it
termed
“locking
out”
of
employees
and
also
seeking
an
order
that
both
the
predecessor
employer
and
the
petitioner
should
be
required
to
submit
to
arbitration
issues,
which
the
union
desired
to
raise
as
to
the
rights
of
the
employees
to
continue
at
their
jobs
as
to
the
right
of
the
union
to
insist
the
collective
bargaining
continuing
effect.
and
at
a
subsequent
date,
that
case
was
removed
to
federal
court.
it
was
quickly
submitted
to
the
court
under
rule
65
or
the
rules
for
civil
procedure.
there
was
an
immediate
final
hearing.
the
case
was
submitted
on
stipulated
facts.
the
court
was
puzzled
frankly
as
to
appropriate
application
of
this
court’s
decision
in
national
labor
relations
board
versus
burns
and
this
court’s
decision
in
john
wiley
and
sons
versus
livingston,
and
the
court
attempted
to
accommodate
those
two
decisions.
and
we
submit
that
the
court
committed
error.
the
court
of
appeals
also
faced
the
problem
of
the
accommodation
of
wiley
and
burns.
the
district
court
said
that
it
was
holding
only
that
the
union’s
request
that
the
merit
go
to
arbitration
should
be
sustained,
and
that
that
did
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
contract
in
total
should
be
applied.
that
was
in
recognition
of
the
decision
of
this
court
that
a
contract
does
not
survive
the
transfer
of
a
business,
as
stated
in
burns.
when
that
question
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
same
problem
existed
in
the
mind
of
the
court.
this
court
having
said
that
the
contract
does
not
survive
but
nevertheless,
this
court
not
having
overruled
wiley
what
should
be
the
application
of
this
contract
to
this
petition.
i
might
point
out
unlike
wiley.
in
this
case,
there
is
still
a
predecessor
employer.
the
entities,
which
i
have
referred
to
as
grissoms,
appeared
in
the
original
proceeding,
first
in
the
state
court
and
in
the
united
states
district
court.
they
did
not
contest
the
union’s
request
for
arbitration.
they
stipulated
that
they
will
arbitrate
the
issues
which
the
union
has
sought
to
raise.
so
there
will
be
an
arbitration
proceeding
if
the
respondent
desires
to
press
that,
and
that
as
i
say
is
a
very
large
difference
from
the
wiley
situation
in
which
the
predecessor
employer
had
disappeared
by
merger.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
no,
if
i
could
just
--
no,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
did
not
mean
that
in
that
proceeding
that
could
--
mr.
james
d.
tracy
the
issue
as
to
whether
grissoms
have
breached
the
contract
they
made
with
the
respondent.
did
they,
when
they
agreed
that
that
contract
would
be
binding
on
themselves
and
successors,
commit?
that
if
they
sold
their
business,
they
would
require
the
successor
to
assume
the
contract.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
an
arbitrator
has
wide
authority
to
make
an
appropriate
award
and
in
that
case,
i
submit
he
could
award
money
damages
without
question.
i
think
that
is
his
authority.
so
in
this
case,
we
come
to
the
issue
should
this
employer,
the
bound
arbitrate,
under
that
contract
of
the
grissoms.
now,
the
starting
point
of
that
is,
is
the
employer
a
successor?
and
the
difference
between
those
case
and
in
almost
every
case
involving
the
definition
of
successor
which
has
ever
come
up
is
that
this
employer
did
not
employ
more
than
a
few
of
the
employees
of
the
predecessor,
and
the
question
becomes
is
the
employment
of
at
least
a
sufficient
number
of
employees
to
constitute
a
majority
--
mr.
james
d.
tracy
in
one
of
the
two
situations,
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
is
none.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
that
is
correct.
there
is
a
footnote
in
the
union
brief
which
i
think
it’s
page
22,
which
seems
to
indicate
that
maybe
the
petitioner
has
stated
the
court
order
in
this
case
too
broadly
and
that
maybe
all
the
district
court
ordered
was
that
there
would
be
arbitration
as
to
the
effect
on
the
employees
the
union
represents
--
that’s
what
it
says
--
of
the
action
that
took
place
here.
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
union
has
sought
broad
arbitration
and
that
indeed,
it
seeks
to
apply
the
entire
contract
although
both
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
have
said,
“the
difference
between
those
case
in
burns
is
that
unlike
the
labor
board
--.”
and
this
is
the
court
of
appeals’
language,
“the
arbitrator
could
be
selective
in
his
application
of
the
contract.
he
need
not
adopt
an
all
or
nothing
approach.”
now
we
submit
that
that
is
not
possible.
the
arbitrator
as
this
court
has
frequently
recognized
is
a
product
of
a
contract.
arbitration
is
a
voluntary
contractual
thing.
mr.
justice
powell
in
the
recent
case
of
alexander
versus
gardner-denver
noted
limitation
on
the
arbitrator.
and
in
gateway
coal,
he
noted
that
arbitration
exists
only
when
there
is
a
contract
to
arbitrate.
now,
the
contract
which
is
applicable
in
this
case
has
a
clause
in
it
that
says,
“the
arbitrator
cannot
add
to,
nor
subtract
from,
nor
modify
the
contract
and
no
issue
as
to
renewal
or
extension
of
the
contract
is
subject
to
arbitration.”
we
submit
that
the
courts
below
have
ignored
that
contract
provision
in
suggesting
that
an
arbitrator
could
somehow
not
take
an
all
or
nothing
approach
to
the
contract,
that
he
could
some
way
or
another
decide
that
some
provisions
of
the
contract
should
apply
but
not
others.
and
we
submit
also
that
such
an
approach
would
leave
an
arbitrator
completely
contrary
to
the
burns’
decision
of
this
court.
now
again,
the
arbitrator
doesn’t
have
authority
to
make
a
new
contract
for
the
parties.
his
authority
is
to
interpret
a
contract
which
the
parties
have
made,
but
he
cannot
pick
and
choose
among
the
provisions
of
the
contract
and
say
this
will
apply
to
this
new
employer,
but
this
will
not.
and
again,
mr.
justice
powell
noted
in
the
gardner-denver
case
that
the
arbitrator
cannot
go
outside
the
contract.
he
went
on
in
that
case.
the
arbitrator
really
cannot
even
go
to
application
of
the
civil
rights
laws.
he
is
limited
to
the
application
of
the
contract.
actually,
what
occurred
here
of
course
is
the
arbitrator
is
bound
to
accept
the
entire
contract
and
clearly,
he
accepts
the
seniority
provisions
in
the
contract
and
his
first
ruling
is
that
the
petitioner
should
have
taken
all
of
these
employees
of
the
predecessor
as
its
employees
because
they
had
seniority
rights
with
the
predecessor
under
this
contract.
now
if
that
is
so
of
course,
there
is
also
a
union
recognition
clause
and
a
union
bargaining
status
clause
in
the
contract
and
presumably,
the
union
has
now
become
the
sole
bargaining
representative
of
the
employees
of
petitioner.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
there
is
no
question
about
it,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
exactly.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
and
that
does
away
with
the
issue
that
--
the
second
issue
that
this
court
considered
in
burns,
the
question
whether
the
union
is
the
majority
representative
if
in
fact
we
are
bound
to
take
all
of
these
employees,
of
course
the
union
is
then
the
representative
and
we
then
do
have
the
union
with
recognitional
status.
so
the
things
that
we
decided
in
burns
just
would
not
occur
in
this
case.
now,
should
that
be
because
this
case
came
up
in
the
context
of
a
suit
by
the
union
under
section
301
whereas
burns
came
up
as
an
appeal
from
a
national
labor
relations
board
decision,
and
the
court
of
appeals
faced
that
squarely.
they
said
there
can
be
a
dichotomy
or
can
be
two
different
rules.
it
is
a
contract
in
301
but
it’s
not
a
contract
in
the
board.
we
submit
this
court
cannot
let
that
ruling
stand.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
no
question,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
have
here
many
of
the
criteria
of
successorship.
the
question
is
however,
do
we
have
the
freedom
to
select
our
own
labor
force?
if
we
do
and
if
that
is
a
crucial
factor
in
determining
whether
an
employer
is
a
successor
and
we
have
not
become
a
successor,
and
most
of
the
statements
of
the
criteria
of
successorship
include
the
composition
of
the
work
force
and
the
composition
of
the
supervisory
force.
now,
we
do
not
have
those.
i
would
like
to
conclude
this
portion
of
my
argument
and
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
but
i
submit
that
this
court
should
go
back
to
the
decision
in
lincoln
mills
as
a
starting
point
in
the
approach
to
this
case.
lincoln
mills
said
that
under
section
301,
the
federal
courts
are
to
apply
a
body
of
federal
law
developed
from
the
intent
of
the
federal
labor
laws.
the
intent
of
the
federal
labor
law
is
clear;
there
must
be
majority
status
in
order
for
the
union
to
gain
recognition.
there
cannot
be
a
contract
in
a
court
proceeding
but
no
contract
in
a
board
proceeding.
that
is
completely
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
lincoln
mills.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
yes,
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
your
honor,
we
believe
that
is
what
this
court
said
in
burns.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
no
doubt,
your
honor,
no
question
whatever.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
your
honor,
it
so
happens
that
i
was
the
attorney
for
an
employer
in
a
case
which
was
a
companion
to
the
burns
case
at
the
board,
and
my
client
desired
that
the
contract
continue
in
effect.
the
union
did
not.
the
company
had
been
bought
by
a
larger
company.
the
union
saw
an
opportunity
to
negotiate
a
better
contract.
the
board,
as
you
know
in
burns,
said
the
contract
did
continue.
the
case
in
which
i
was
involved
was
never
appealed.
i
submit
that
it
had
been
appealed
with
burns,
the
result
would’ve
been
the
same
as
burns.
the
continuation
of
the
contract
is
a
two-party
affair.
the
contract
does
not
run
with
the
business,
as
mr.
justice
marshall
says.
it
is
something
which
is
a
matter
of
consent,
and
both
the
company
and
the
union
must
consent
for
the
contract
to
continue
in
effect,
and
this
court
pointed
out
in
burns
the
policy
considerations
which
require
that.
court
pointed
out
that
there
could
be
considerations
on
both
sides
of
the
bargain.
now,
the
duty
--
the
contractual,
consensual
duty
to
be
bound
by
that
contract
and
to
arbitrate
in
accordance
with
the
contract
is
inevitably
intertwined
with
the
status
of
successor.
and
the
questions
which
the
court
has
put
to
mr.
gold
demonstrate
the
difference
this
case
and
wiley,
and
indeed
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
case
like
lion
dry
goods.
in
wiley,
the
plaintiffs
who
brought
grievances
had
attained
employment
status
with
the
employer,
and
thereafter,
had
grievances
arise,
differences
with
their
employer.
and
this
court
in
wiley
held
that
those
grievances
which
arose
after
the
employment’s
relationship
existed
rose
subject
arbitration
under
their
contract
of
the
prior
employer.
there
is
certainly
a
serious
question
whether
even
that
can
stand
today
in
view
of
the
court’s
unanimous
ruling
that
the
contract
does
not
survive.
the
question
becomes,
what
is
parameters
for
the
arbitrator?
what
is
the
basis
in
which
he
can
make
a
decision?
but,
in
any
event
the
contract
cannot
be
a
vehicle
with
which
the
persons
who
claim
grievances
under
this
contract
can
attain
employment
status
with
the
new
employer.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
your
honor,
that
is
true.
that
is
a
matter
of
statute.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
your
honor,
i
agree.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
well,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
there
certainly
is
a
statutory
requirement
that
we
honor
the
contract,
i
understand
when
you
asked
that
question
yesterday
and
you
didn’t
get
a
very
clear
answer,
but
we
know
that
successorship
is
not
a
statutory
doctrine.
it’s
a
board
and
court
doctrine.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
now,
there
are
some
contracts
which
perhaps
by
bought
sales
act
or
other
statutory
enactment,
maybe
become
an
obligation
of
a
purchaser,
but
there
are
many
others
who
do
not.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
congress
could
--
mr.
james
d.
tracy
exactly.
exactly,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
fact
that
they
enacted
that
kind
indicates
that
if
they
had
dared
to
go
further
and
cover
the
kind
of
situation
that
is
here
today,
they
could
well
have
done
so
by
legislation.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
your
honor,
that
is
section
9
(d)
of
the
act.
that’s
the
holding
of
this
court
in
h.k.
porter,
and
the
argument
that
somehow
in
other
--
it
might
be
different
that
9
(d)
which
is
a
statement
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
somehow
doesn’t
apply
in
an
enforcement
of
contract
situation
just
cannot
stand.
this
court
has
recognized
there
must
be
one
body
of
law.
i
referred
yesterday
to
the
lincoln
mills
decision.
counsel
this
morning
referred
to
the
lucas
flower
decision
of
this
court.
and
in
lucas
flower,
this
court
said
“the
possibility
that
individual
contract
terms
might
have
different
meanings
under
state
and
federal
law
would
inevitably
exert
a
disruptive
influence
upon
both
the
negotiation
and
administration
of
collective
agreements.”
if
it
can’t
have
different
meanings,
under
state
and
federal
law,
cannot
have
different
meanings
in
a
board
case
as
compared
with
a
court
case.
we
submit
that
clearly,
it
cannot,
and
returning
mr.
chief
justice
to
the
question
you
raised
yesterday
relative
to
the
short
hiatus,
is
certainly
that
is
an
aspect
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
there
is
a
continuity
of
the
business,
but
there
are
many
factors.
again,
going
to
mr.
justice
white’s
questions,
there
are
many
factors
which
determine
the
successorship
status,
and
this
court
has
carefully
considered
them.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
concerned
with
them
in
the
burns
case.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
that
is
the
real
meaning
of
the
wiley
decision,
and
that’s
the
full
meaning
of
the
wiley
decision.
you
cannot
boot
scrap
the
successorship
doctrine
without
retention
of
employees,
or
hiring
of
employees
by
the
new
employer
into
a
requirement
that
he
must
take
the
employees,
and
therefore
must
recognize
the
union,
unless
you
are
really
going
to
say
as
mr.
justice
white
said
that
you’re
going
to
take
a
very
large
bite
out
of
burns.
there
is
in
burns
a
decision
which
was
unanimous
as
to
the
effect
of
the
contract.
and
that
decision
is
not
consistent
with
the
position
of
respondent
in
this
case,
or
the
position
of
the
court
below.
it
is
consistent
with
the
petitioner’s
position.
we
request
therefore,
that
the
court
reverse
the
decision
below.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
as
you
know
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
sixth
circuit.
that
court
affirmed
a
decision
of
the
united
states
district
court
which
had
held
the
petitioner,
together
with
another
employer,
was
required
to
arbitrate
under
the
collective
bargaining
contract
of
the
other
employer.
actually,
there
were
two
other
employers
they
are
referred
to
in
the
brief
as
grissoms
and
because
there
were
several
names,
i
will
use
that
name
for
convenience.
the
issues
presented
are
of
whether
petitioner
is
a
successor
employer
as
that
term
is
used
as
a
term
of
art
in
labor
law,
and
whether
petitioner
is
required
to
arbitrate
grievances
presented
by
respondent
union
under
the
contract
between
respondent
union
and
the
other
employer,
the
grissoms.
the
case
arose
with
the
beginning
of
june
1972
when
petitioner,
howard
johnson
company
entered
into
an
agreement
with
his
other
employer
as
referred
to
as
grissoms,
under
which
it
was
to
buy
a
motel
and
a
restaurant
then
being
operated
by
the
grissoms
who
were
franchisees
of
the
howard
johnson
company.
that
agreement
provided
for
sale
of
certain
assets
in
the
motel
and
restaurant
and
for
leasing
of
property
on
which
they
stood.
it
did
not
provide
for
assumption
of
contracts
other
than
a
contract
with
respect
to
advertising.
on
july
9,
the
--
excuse
me
--
on
june
28,
the
howard
johnson
company
petitioner
notified
the
seller
that
it
would
not
assume
the
labor
contract
which
the
seller
had
with
respondent
union,
two
contracts
existed.
on
july
9,
the
other
employer
notified
its
employees
that
they
would
be
terminated
at
july
23.
on
july
13,
the
petitioner
notified
respondent
union
who
had
inquired
at
that
time
as
to
petitioner’s
intent
that
it
would
not
recognize
the
union
contract,
which
respondent
had
with
the
other
employer.
a
few
days
later,
the
petitioner
commenced
interviewing
prospective
employees.
it
put
advertisements
in
the
local
newspapers.
indeed,
it
put
a
sign
in
the
very
motel
and
restaurant
where
its
business
is
being
conducted,
saying
that
it
would
be
hiring
employees.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
there
was
no
stop,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
yes,
sir.
a
contract
ultimately
called
for
closing
at
12:01
am
and
the
testimony
is
--
and
this
was
put
in
on
stipulated
facts
but
the
record
is
clear
that
at
12
o’clock,
the
franchisee
discontinued
its
operations.]
mr.
james
d.
tracy
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
certainly
goes
to
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
a
successor
employer
and
i
will
certainly
discuss
that
issue
with
the
court.
the
petitioner
did
hire
employees.
it
hired
some
who
had
worked
for
this
predecessor
employer.
actually,
it
was
9
of
the
33
i
think
in
the
restaurant
and
none
of
approximately
12
in
the
motel.
it
had
a
complete
change
of
supervisory
employees;
none
of
the
supervisory
employees
of
the
predecessor
were
retained.
an
entire
new
supervisory
staff
was
brought
in.
the
employees
who
were
hired
prior
to
july
24,
the
date
on
which
the
transaction
was
closed,
were
trained
at
another
howard
johnson
facility
which
was
nearby.
and
thereafter,
on
july
24,
the
transaction
was
ready
for
closing
and
that
was
a
sunday
night
or
a
monday
morning,
but
on
the
friday
preceding
that,
respondent
union
brought
suit
in
state
court
seeking
an
injunction
against
what
it
termed
“locking
out”
of
employees
and
also
seeking
an
order
that
both
the
predecessor
employer
and
the
petitioner
should
be
required
to
submit
to
arbitration
issues,
which
the
union
desired
to
raise
as
to
the
rights
of
the
employees
to
continue
at
their
jobs
as
to
the
right
of
the
union
to
insist
the
collective
bargaining
continuing
effect.
and
at
a
subsequent
date,
that
case
was
removed
to
federal
court.
it
was
quickly
submitted
to
the
court
under
rule
65
or
the
rules
for
civil
procedure.
there
was
an
immediate
final
hearing.
the
case
was
submitted
on
stipulated
facts.
the
court
was
puzzled
frankly
as
to
appropriate
application
of
this
court’s
decision
in
national
labor
relations
board
versus
burns
and
this
court’s
decision
in
john
wiley
and
sons
versus
livingston,
and
the
court
attempted
to
accommodate
those
two
decisions.
and
we
submit
that
the
court
committed
error.
the
court
of
appeals
also
faced
the
problem
of
the
accommodation
of
wiley
and
burns.
the
district
court
said
that
it
was
holding
only
that
the
union’s
request
that
the
merit
go
to
arbitration
should
be
sustained,
and
that
that
did
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
contract
in
total
should
be
applied.
that
was
in
recognition
of
the
decision
of
this
court
that
a
contract
does
not
survive
the
transfer
of
a
business,
as
stated
in
burns.
when
that
question
got
to
the
court
of
appeals,
the
same
problem
existed
in
the
mind
of
the
court.
this
court
having
said
that
the
contract
does
not
survive
but
nevertheless,
this
court
not
having
overruled
wiley
what
should
be
the
application
of
this
contract
to
this
petition.
i
might
point
out
unlike
wiley.
in
this
case,
there
is
still
a
predecessor
employer.
the
entities,
which
i
have
referred
to
as
grissoms,
appeared
in
the
original
proceeding,
first
in
the
state
court
and
in
the
united
states
district
court.
they
did
not
contest
the
union’s
request
for
arbitration.
they
stipulated
that
they
will
arbitrate
the
issues
which
the
union
has
sought
to
raise.
so
there
will
be
an
arbitration
proceeding
if
the
respondent
desires
to
press
that,
and
that
as
i
say
is
a
very
large
difference
from
the
wiley
situation
in
which
the
predecessor
employer
had
disappeared
by
merger.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
no,
if
i
could
just
--
no,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
did
not
mean
that
in
that
proceeding
that
could
--
mr.
james
d.
tracy
the
issue
as
to
whether
grissoms
have
breached
the
contract
they
made
with
the
respondent.
did
they,
when
they
agreed
that
that
contract
would
be
binding
on
themselves
and
successors,
commit?
that
if
they
sold
their
business,
they
would
require
the
successor
to
assume
the
contract.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
an
arbitrator
has
wide
authority
to
make
an
appropriate
award
and
in
that
case,
i
submit
he
could
award
money
damages
without
question.
i
think
that
is
his
authority.
so
in
this
case,
we
come
to
the
issue
should
this
employer,
the
bound
arbitrate,
under
that
contract
of
the
grissoms.
now,
the
starting
point
of
that
is,
is
the
employer
a
successor?
and
the
difference
between
those
case
and
in
almost
every
case
involving
the
definition
of
successor
which
has
ever
come
up
is
that
this
employer
did
not
employ
more
than
a
few
of
the
employees
of
the
predecessor,
and
the
question
becomes
is
the
employment
of
at
least
a
sufficient
number
of
employees
to
constitute
a
majority
--
mr.
james
d.
tracy
in
one
of
the
two
situations,
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
is
none.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
that
is
correct.
there
is
a
footnote
in
the
union
brief
which
i
think
it’s
page
22,
which
seems
to
indicate
that
maybe
the
petitioner
has
stated
the
court
order
in
this
case
too
broadly
and
that
maybe
all
the
district
court
ordered
was
that
there
would
be
arbitration
as
to
the
effect
on
the
employees
the
union
represents
--
that’s
what
it
says
--
of
the
action
that
took
place
here.
we
think
it
is
clear
that
the
union
has
sought
broad
arbitration
and
that
indeed,
it
seeks
to
apply
the
entire
contract
although
both
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
have
said,
“the
difference
between
those
case
in
burns
is
that
unlike
the
labor
board
--.”
and
this
is
the
court
of
appeals’
language,
“the
arbitrator
could
be
selective
in
his
application
of
the
contract.
he
need
not
adopt
an
all
or
nothing
approach.”
now
we
submit
that
that
is
not
possible.
the
arbitrator
as
this
court
has
frequently
recognized
is
a
product
of
a
contract.
arbitration
is
a
voluntary
contractual
thing.
mr.
justice
powell
in
the
recent
case
of
alexander
versus
gardner-denver
noted
limitation
on
the
arbitrator.
and
in
gateway
coal,
he
noted
that
arbitration
exists
only
when
there
is
a
contract
to
arbitrate.
now,
the
contract
which
is
applicable
in
this
case
has
a
clause
in
it
that
says,
“the
arbitrator
cannot
add
to,
nor
subtract
from,
nor
modify
the
contract
and
no
issue
as
to
renewal
or
extension
of
the
contract
is
subject
to
arbitration.”
we
submit
that
the
courts
below
have
ignored
that
contract
provision
in
suggesting
that
an
arbitrator
could
somehow
not
take
an
all
or
nothing
approach
to
the
contract,
that
he
could
some
way
or
another
decide
that
some
provisions
of
the
contract
should
apply
but
not
others.
and
we
submit
also
that
such
an
approach
would
leave
an
arbitrator
completely
contrary
to
the
burns’
decision
of
this
court.
now
again,
the
arbitrator
doesn’t
have
authority
to
make
a
new
contract
for
the
parties.
his
authority
is
to
interpret
a
contract
which
the
parties
have
made,
but
he
cannot
pick
and
choose
among
the
provisions
of
the
contract
and
say
this
will
apply
to
this
new
employer,
but
this
will
not.
and
again,
mr.
justice
powell
noted
in
the
gardner-denver
case
that
the
arbitrator
cannot
go
outside
the
contract.
he
went
on
in
that
case.
the
arbitrator
really
cannot
even
go
to
application
of
the
civil
rights
laws.
he
is
limited
to
the
application
of
the
contract.
actually,
what
occurred
here
of
course
is
the
arbitrator
is
bound
to
accept
the
entire
contract
and
clearly,
he
accepts
the
seniority
provisions
in
the
contract
and
his
first
ruling
is
that
the
petitioner
should
have
taken
all
of
these
employees
of
the
predecessor
as
its
employees
because
they
had
seniority
rights
with
the
predecessor
under
this
contract.
now
if
that
is
so
of
course,
there
is
also
a
union
recognition
clause
and
a
union
bargaining
status
clause
in
the
contract
and
presumably,
the
union
has
now
become
the
sole
bargaining
representative
of
the
employees
of
petitioner.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
there
is
no
question
about
it,
your
honor.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
exactly.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
and
that
does
away
with
the
issue
that
--
the
second
issue
that
this
court
considered
in
burns,
the
question
whether
the
union
is
the
majority
representative
if
in
fact
we
are
bound
to
take
all
of
these
employees,
of
course
the
union
is
then
the
representative
and
we
then
do
have
the
union
with
recognitional
status.
so
the
things
that
we
decided
in
burns
just
would
not
occur
in
this
case.
now,
should
that
be
because
this
case
came
up
in
the
context
of
a
suit
by
the
union
under
section
301
whereas
burns
came
up
as
an
appeal
from
a
national
labor
relations
board
decision,
and
the
court
of
appeals
faced
that
squarely.
they
said
there
can
be
a
dichotomy
or
can
be
two
different
rules.
it
is
a
contract
in
301
but
it’s
not
a
contract
in
the
board.
we
submit
this
court
cannot
let
that
ruling
stand.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
no
question,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
we
have
here
many
of
the
criteria
of
successorship.
the
question
is
however,
do
we
have
the
freedom
to
select
our
own
labor
force?
if
we
do
and
if
that
is
a
crucial
factor
in
determining
whether
an
employer
is
a
successor
and
we
have
not
become
a
successor,
and
most
of
the
statements
of
the
criteria
of
successorship
include
the
composition
of
the
work
force
and
the
composition
of
the
supervisory
force.
now,
we
do
not
have
those.
i
would
like
to
conclude
this
portion
of
my
argument
and
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
but
i
submit
that
this
court
should
go
back
to
the
decision
in
lincoln
mills
as
a
starting
point
in
the
approach
to
this
case.
lincoln
mills
said
that
under
section
301,
the
federal
courts
are
to
apply
a
body
of
federal
law
developed
from
the
intent
of
the
federal
labor
laws.
the
intent
of
the
federal
labor
law
is
clear;
there
must
be
majority
status
in
order
for
the
union
to
gain
recognition.
there
cannot
be
a
contract
in
a
court
proceeding
but
no
contract
in
a
board
proceeding.
that
is
completely
contrary
to
the
spirit
of
lincoln
mills.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
yes,
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
your
honor,
we
believe
that
is
what
this
court
said
in
burns.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
no
doubt,
your
honor,
no
question
whatever.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
your
honor,
it
so
happens
that
i
was
the
attorney
for
an
employer
in
a
case
which
was
a
companion
to
the
burns
case
at
the
board,
and
my
client
desired
that
the
contract
continue
in
effect.
the
union
did
not.
the
company
had
been
bought
by
a
larger
company.
the
union
saw
an
opportunity
to
negotiate
a
better
contract.
the
board,
as
you
know
in
burns,
said
the
contract
did
continue.
the
case
in
which
i
was
involved
was
never
appealed.
i
submit
that
it
had
been
appealed
with
burns,
the
result
would’ve
been
the
same
as
burns.
the
continuation
of
the
contract
is
a
two-party
affair.
the
contract
does
not
run
with
the
business,
as
mr.
justice
marshall
says.
it
is
something
which
is
a
matter
of
consent,
and
both
the
company
and
the
union
must
consent
for
the
contract
to
continue
in
effect,
and
this
court
pointed
out
in
burns
the
policy
considerations
which
require
that.
court
pointed
out
that
there
could
be
considerations
on
both
sides
of
the
bargain.
now,
the
duty
--
the
contractual,
consensual
duty
to
be
bound
by
that
contract
and
to
arbitrate
in
accordance
with
the
contract
is
inevitably
intertwined
with
the
status
of
successor.
and
the
questions
which
the
court
has
put
to
mr.
gold
demonstrate
the
difference
this
case
and
wiley,
and
indeed
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
case
like
lion
dry
goods.
in
wiley,
the
plaintiffs
who
brought
grievances
had
attained
employment
status
with
the
employer,
and
thereafter,
had
grievances
arise,
differences
with
their
employer.
and
this
court
in
wiley
held
that
those
grievances
which
arose
after
the
employment’s
relationship
existed
rose
subject
arbitration
under
their
contract
of
the
prior
employer.
there
is
certainly
a
serious
question
whether
even
that
can
stand
today
in
view
of
the
court’s
unanimous
ruling
that
the
contract
does
not
survive.
the
question
becomes,
what
is
parameters
for
the
arbitrator?
what
is
the
basis
in
which
he
can
make
a
decision?
but,
in
any
event
the
contract
cannot
be
a
vehicle
with
which
the
persons
who
claim
grievances
under
this
contract
can
attain
employment
status
with
the
new
employer.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
your
honor,
that
is
true.
that
is
a
matter
of
statute.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
your
honor,
i
agree.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
well,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
there
certainly
is
a
statutory
requirement
that
we
honor
the
contract,
i
understand
when
you
asked
that
question
yesterday
and
you
didn’t
get
a
very
clear
answer,
but
we
know
that
successorship
is
not
a
statutory
doctrine.
it’s
a
board
and
court
doctrine.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
now,
there
are
some
contracts
which
perhaps
by
bought
sales
act
or
other
statutory
enactment,
maybe
become
an
obligation
of
a
purchaser,
but
there
are
many
others
who
do
not.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
congress
could
--
mr.
james
d.
tracy
exactly.
exactly,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
fact
that
they
enacted
that
kind
indicates
that
if
they
had
dared
to
go
further
and
cover
the
kind
of
situation
that
is
here
today,
they
could
well
have
done
so
by
legislation.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
your
honor,
that
is
section
9
(d)
of
the
act.
that’s
the
holding
of
this
court
in
h.k.
porter,
and
the
argument
that
somehow
in
other
--
it
might
be
different
that
9
(d)
which
is
a
statement
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
somehow
doesn’t
apply
in
an
enforcement
of
contract
situation
just
cannot
stand.
this
court
has
recognized
there
must
be
one
body
of
law.
i
referred
yesterday
to
the
lincoln
mills
decision.
counsel
this
morning
referred
to
the
lucas
flower
decision
of
this
court.
and
in
lucas
flower,
this
court
said
“the
possibility
that
individual
contract
terms
might
have
different
meanings
under
state
and
federal
law
would
inevitably
exert
a
disruptive
influence
upon
both
the
negotiation
and
administration
of
collective
agreements.”
if
it
can’t
have
different
meanings,
under
state
and
federal
law,
cannot
have
different
meanings
in
a
board
case
as
compared
with
a
court
case.
we
submit
that
clearly,
it
cannot,
and
returning
mr.
chief
justice
to
the
question
you
raised
yesterday
relative
to
the
short
hiatus,
is
certainly
that
is
an
aspect
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
there
is
a
continuity
of
the
business,
but
there
are
many
factors.
again,
going
to
mr.
justice
white’s
questions,
there
are
many
factors
which
determine
the
successorship
status,
and
this
court
has
carefully
considered
them.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
was
concerned
with
them
in
the
burns
case.
mr.
james
d.
tracy
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
that
is
the
real
meaning
of
the
wiley
decision,
and
that’s
the
full
meaning
of
the
wiley
decision.
you
cannot
boot
scrap
the
successorship
doctrine
without
retention
of
employees,
or
hiring
of
employees
by
the
new
employer
into
a
requirement
that
he
must
take
the
employees,
and
therefore
must
recognize
the
union,
unless
you
are
really
going
to
say
as
mr.
justice
white
said
that
you’re
going
to
take
a
very
large
bite
out
of
burns.
there
is
in
burns
a
decision
which
was
unanimous
as
to
the
effect
of
the
contract.
and
that
decision
is
not
consistent
with
the
position
of
respondent
in
this
case,
or
the
position
of
the
court
below.
it
is
consistent
with
the
petitioner’s
position.
we
request
therefore,
that
the
court
reverse
the
decision
below.
