there’s
a
lot
of
difference.
normally
contracts
don’t
run

my
own
problem
is
it
doesn’t
do
it
in
and
of
itself.
i
thought
you
said
the
contract
in
and
of
itself
work
with
the
business

what
the

said.
it’s
not

howard

versus

hotel
and
restaurant
employees
union.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
petitioner
howard
johnson
purchased
the
assets
of
a
restaurant
and
motor
lodge.
in
taking
over
operation
of
these
facilities,
howard
johnson
employed
only
a
small
fraction
of
the
employees
of
the
previous
operator.
this
action
was
brought
by
the
respondent
union
which
was
the
collective-bargaining
representative
of
the
predecessor's
employees.
union
brought
this
suit
under
section
301
of
the
labor
management
relations
act,
to
compel
howard
johnson
to
arbitrate
the
extent
of
his
obligations
to
the
predecessor's
employees
under
the
obligation
clause
of
the
preexisting
collective-bargaining
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
previous
operator.
the
district
court
ordered
arbitration
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
it.
for
the
reasons
set
out
more
fully
in
our
opinion,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
a
recent
decision
in
nlrb
versus
burns
international
security
services
establish
that
howard
johnson
had
the
right
not
to
hire
any
of
the
employees
of
prior
owner
and
he
commences
operation
of
the
restaurant
and
motor
lodge
with
his
own
workforce.
that
being
so,
the
union's
efforts
to
compel
arbitration
in
the
hope
that
it'd
be
arbitrated
or
ought
to
have
johnson
to
hire
all
of
the
former
employees
must
fail.
although,
we
have
held
that
in
some
circumstances,
a
successor
employer
maybe
compelled
to
arbitrate
under
the
collective-bargaining
agreement
of
the
predecessor,
burns
requires
that
no
obligation
arbitrate
can
be
imposed
on
a
successor
employer
in
the
absence
of
a
substantial
continuity

identity
in
the

the
change
