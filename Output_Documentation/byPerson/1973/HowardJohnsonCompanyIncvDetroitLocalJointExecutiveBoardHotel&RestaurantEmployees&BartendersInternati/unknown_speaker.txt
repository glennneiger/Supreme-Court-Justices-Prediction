unknown
speaker
suppose
the
arbitrator
concludes,
yes,
they
did
breach
it.
what’s
the
award?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
--
especially
this
is
in
effect
to
say,
although
burns
said
you
didn’t
have
to
hire
anybody.
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
right,
this
might
be
to
fail
to
hire
everybody?
unknown
speaker
so
that’s
really
--
unknown
speaker
--
the
door
of
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don’t
know
what
wiley
would
have
said
if
the
successor
corporation
--
if
that
had
been
a
purchase
of
assets
case
and
if
the
buyer
had
hired
none
of
the
employees
of
the
predecessor,
you
have
no
idea
what
wiley
would
have
said?
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
know
whether
it
went
aboard
to
arbitration?
unknown
speaker
yes,
well
--
but
you
don’t
know
what
it
would
have
said
in
view
of
the
--
if
there
had
not
been
any
employees
taken
over?
unknown
speaker
that
is
one
of
the
elements
in
deciding
successorship
in
the
first
place,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
or
it
used
to
be.
unknown
speaker
well
that’s
just
your
--
that’s
the
root.
that
originated
with
wiley,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
know
what
wiley
would
have
said
if
there
had
not
--
if
there
had
been
a
situation
where
there
were
not
any
former
employees
involved?
unknown
speaker
mr.
gold,
is
that
to
subsume
that
the
agreement
itself
then
survives
the
sale?
unknown
speaker
well
that
in
other
words,
the
obligations
upon
the
successor
to
the
business?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
gold,
what
about
the
steps
that
precede
arbitration
that
the
contract
probably
requires?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that
is
at
the
successor
then
has
to
negotiate,
whatever
the
grievance
may
be,
or
attempt
to
negotiate
that
settlement
with
the
union
representatives
on
exhaust
type
before
the
government?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
recognition?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
realistically
what
we’re
talking
about
here,
i
gather,
is
the
grievance
of
the
separation
of
these,
what
is
it,
41
employees.
unknown
speaker
and
that
we
say
that
the
employer
is
free
when
he
purchases
this
business,
not
to
continue
the
employment
of
anybody
in
the
unit,
he
did
in
this
instance,
employee
9,
but
the
41
say
“well
you
couldn’t
have
separated
us.”
and
that
becomes
a
grievance
and
this
all
has
to
go
through
the
grievance
procedure
before
they
get
services?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
as
a
practical
matter
mr.
gold,
your
submission
is,
but
if
there’s
an
arbitration
clause
under
301
well,
he
has
no
obligation
to
hire.
the
arbitrator
may
order
him
to
re-employ
all
41.
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
difficulties
for
me
is
that
if
it’s
true
that
to
this
extent,
the
contract
is
binding
on
the
successor.
then
i
have
a
difficulty
seeing
why
this
in
finding
out
a
successor
in
all
respects
including
recognition.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
put
all
41
back
to
work,
there
certainly
is
going
to
be
a
duty
to
bargain,
because
there’s
going
to
be
all
the
employees
in
the
unit.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
maybe
that
the
rules
continue,
but
the
basic
question
here
is
to
what
employees
do
they
apply?
unknown
speaker
and
that
maybe
--
unknown
speaker
well,
they
don’t
want
to
be
changing
the
rules,
it
just
that
even
if
you
said
that
the
same
rules
apply
to
the
successor,
you
could
still
say
that
he
may
bring
his
own
employees
along.
unknown
speaker
you
certainly
are
taking
quite
a
bite
out
of
burns,
i
suppose,
in
these
cases,
in
that
argument.
unknown
speaker
well,
here
on
your
approach,
the
successor
employer,
whether
he
thinks
it’s
bad
or
good
is
bound
by
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
in
a
contract
that
he
never
negotiated.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tracy,
listen,
why
as
he
point
out
yesterday,
the
court
did
not
go
on
and
discuss
what
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
was?
now,
i
assume
that
you
would
concede
that
some
successors
might
express
they
want
to
assume
the
contract.
as
your
client
--
as
you
know
your
client
did.
and
that
maybe,
that
nothing
was
said
in
the
purchase
of
the
sale
about
it.
and
there
maybe
an
issue
especially
if
the
successor
takes
over
a
majority
employees.
there
maybe
an
issue
as
to
whether
there
was
an
assumption
or
not,
or
whether
what
the
agreement
was,
and
that
kind
of
an
issue
submitted
to
an
arbitrator,
i
would
think
would
be
wholly
proper.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
arbitrator
concludes,
yes,
they
did
breach
it.
what’s
the
award?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
--
especially
this
is
in
effect
to
say,
although
burns
said
you
didn’t
have
to
hire
anybody.
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
right,
this
might
be
to
fail
to
hire
everybody?
unknown
speaker
so
that’s
really
--
unknown
speaker
--
the
door
of
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don’t
know
what
wiley
would
have
said
if
the
successor
corporation
--
if
that
had
been
a
purchase
of
assets
case
and
if
the
buyer
had
hired
none
of

of

you

unknown

unknown

mr.

9,
but
the
41
say
“well
you
couldn’t

us.”
and
that
becomes
a
grievance
and
this
all
has
to
go
through
the
grievance
procedure
before
they
get
services?
unknown

yes,

unknown

well,
if
they
put
all
41
back
to

there
certainly
is
going
to
be
a
duty
to
bargain,
because
there’s
going
to
be
all
the
employees
in
the
unit.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
maybe
that
the
rules
continue,
but
the
basic
question
here
is
to
what
employees
do
they
apply?
unknown

and
