mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
analytically,
there
are
two
issues
in
this
type
of
case
which
for
convenience
we
refer
through
--
refer
to
throughout
our
brief
as
a
wiley
type
case,
since
that
is
the
leading
authority
in
the
field.
the
first
is
whether
the
second
employer
is
a
successor
as
that
term
has
been
used
in
the
section
301
law
in
the
second
case.
the
second
question
--
mr.
laurence
gold
the
successorship
concept,
mr.
justice
white?
there
was
board
law
on
the
concept
of
successorship
before
this
court
decided
wiley.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
what
i
am
--
what
i
was
trying
to
do
in
answering
your
question
was
say
there
are
antecedents
in
the
board
law
of
the
successorship
concept.
but
it
is
our
view
that
the
section
301
law
of
successorship
is
not
the
same
as
the
board
law,
and
that
the
law
as
declared
in
wiley
is
not
the
same
as
of
the
law
which
had
developed
in
the
board,
either
in
terms
of
the
test
of
successorship
or
in
terms
of
the
consequence
of
a
finding
those
successorship.
mr.
laurence
gold
nothing.
there
are
no
words
in
301
to
which
we
look
for
guidance.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes
--
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
one
is
the
duty
to
bargain
and
the
--
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
and
it
is
our
view
that
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
the
board
law
preceded
in
by
stating
different
rules
at
different
times.
the
board
law
at
the
time
wiley
was
decided
was
that
a
successor
as
the
board
use
that
term
was
not
bound
by
the
agreement.
mr.
laurence
gold
they
reverse
themselves
in
burns.
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
but
this
court
held
that
in
a
301
case,
the
successor
is
bound
by
his
predecessor’s
duty
to
arbitrate.
that
was
the
holding
in
wiley.
mr.
laurence
gold
and
in
burns,
you
again
dealt
with
the
board
law,
which
was
the
duty
to
bargain
law.
now,
i
am
really
not
sure
that
i
have
been
at
all
responsive
to
the
question.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
it
did
not
map
it
out
for
him.
mr.
laurence
gold
no.
there
were
specific
arbitration
issues
which
had
been
posed
in
wiley.
mr.
laurence
gold
you
mean
in
deciding
any
of
those
specific
issues?
mr.
laurence
gold
my
understanding
of
the
direction
in
wiley
is
that
what’s
open
for
the
arbitrator
to
decide
is
whether
those
portions
of
the
agreement
continue
to
be
a
--
to
create
a
subsidy
of
rules
of
the
continuing
business
enterprise.
and
it’s
our
view,
as
stated
in
the
briefs
that
in
doing
that
job,
he
is
to
look
to
change
circumstances
in
the
equity
of
the
situation,
that
what
we
have
here
is
not
something
which
is
sui
generis
but
rather
a
type
of
arbitration
which
was
contemplated
in
the
steelworker’s
trilogy.
in
the
steelworker’s
trilogy,
the
court
emphasized
the
fact
that
the
arbitrator
is
to
take
into
account
changed
circumstances,
even
in
a
situation
in
which
there
are
not
sufficient
changed
circumstances
so
that
the
second
employer
is
not
a
successor
and
not
bound
by
the
arbitration
clause.
there
may
be
factors
which
it
has
to
meet
an
incumbent
upon
the
arbitrative
taken
to
account
in
determining
the
successor’s
obligations.
and
that’s
what
we
think
wiley
directed
the
arbitrators
to
do,
and
that
is
what
they
have
been
doing.
mr.
laurence
gold
we
know
certain
things
about
what
wiley
would
have
said.
first
of
all
--
mr.
laurence
gold
first
of
all,
we
know
that
in
the
view
of
the
wiley
court,
the
merger
situation
was
considered
a
less
likely
one
than
the
assets
acquisition
situation
for
application
of
the
successorship
doctrine,
because
that
is
what
the
court
said.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
we
do
not
know
precisely
what
they
would
have
said,
but
we
do
know
what
the
general
proposition
that
is
--
mr.
laurence
gold
we
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
laurence
gold
it
has
never
been
so
far
as
we
know
an
element
in
the
section
301
law
of
successorship.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
but
section
30
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
we
don’t
know
in
the
sense
that
in
that
case,
we
--
in
that
case,
the
employer,
although
not
originally
over
mind
to
it,
eventually
did
hire
the
employees.
but
we
do
know
that
there
are
certain
basic
principles.
first
of
all,
we
know
that
in
wiley,
the
successorship
test
was
stated
to
be
whether
there
are
any
substantial
indicia
of
continuity
and
that
it
used
the
fact
that
the
second
employer
hired
the
employees
as
saying
that
that
was
evidence
of
continuity,
not
that
it
was
a
necessary
condition.
and
we
do
know
that
the
general
rule
stated
in
wiley
is
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
our
holding
that
the
obligation
to
arbitrate
survived
the
merger,
where
we
to
hold
that
the
fact
of
the
merger
without
more
removed
claims
otherwise
plainly
arbitrable
from
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
clause?
that’s
at
page
554
376
u.s.
well,
the
issue
--
the
claims
--
mr.
laurence
gold
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
to
briefly
put
the
matter
back
in
focus,
this
is
a
section
301
suit
to
compel
arbitration.
the
problem
it
raises
is
whether
the
duty
to
arbitrate
survives
over
a
change
in
the
identity
of
owners,
where
that
change
takes
place
against
the
background
of
a
collective
agreement
enforced
and
is
brought
about
by
negotiations
between
the
first
employer
and
the
purchaser.
at
the
afternoon
recess
yesterday,
i
was
endeavoring
to
respond
to
mr.
justice
white’s
questions
concerning
the
scope
of
wiley
versus
livingston
which
was
also
a
section
301
case
presenting
the
same
issue.
naturally,
wiley
like
every
other
president
leaves
certain
leeways
in
the
law,
but
it
is
a
recent
decision
and
i
hope
we’ll
be
able
to
demonstrate
that
if
rooted
in
basic
precepts
of
the
national
labor
policy,
and
is
not
simply
a
decision
which
can
be
read
to
settle
the
particular
facts
there
before
the
court.
to
understand
its
lessons,
we
believe
it’s
necessary
to
analyze
its
basic
rationale.
firstly,
--
mr.
laurence
gold
there
are
two
aspects
to
that
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
we
look
at
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
agreement
if
one
means
what
are
the
subsequent
obligations
which
the
second
employer
is
bound
by
to
be
essentially
equivalent
to
the
process
of
arbitration
mapped
out
in
the
steelworkers’
trilogy.
namely
that
in
the
arbitration,
the
arbitrator
is
bound
by
the
agreement,
but
he
is
to
take
into
account
changed
circumstances
and
the
different
equities
of
the
parties,
and
to
fulfill
his
role
as
the
expositor
of
the
contractual
law
set
out
in
the
agreement.
naturally,
the
assumption
is
that
there
will
be
more
need
for
a
creative
and
sensitive
application
of
the
agreement
where
there
is
a
new
employer,
because
he
brings
different
insights,
different
presuppositions,
and
he
may
make
certain
changes
within
his
permitted
scope
under
the
managerial
prerogatives
clause
which
this
agreement
has,
which
may
substantially
change
this
situation.
mr.
laurence
gold
it
survives
to
the
extent
that
the
arbitrator
finds
it
to
be
--
to
comport
with
the
changed
situation.
it
is
the
framework,
the
duty
to
arbitrate
survives
and
the
arbitrator
is
to
determine
the
subsequent
obligations
that
survive.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes
sir.
mr.
laurence
gold
the
answer
that
i
was
attempting
to
give
is
that
my
understanding
is
that
he
is
bound
by
the
framework
of
the
contract.
he
cannot
toss
it
over
his
shoulder
and
act
as
a
someone
who
is
making
law,
but
he
can
take
into
account
reasoned
arguments
from
the
second
employer
that
changed
circumstances,
or
different
equities
makes
specific
provisions
inapplicable.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
is
the
role
that
wiley
envisages
and
that’s
what
in
essence
the
arbitrators
have
been
doing
in
the
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
because
if
that
were
not
true,
then
we
would
have
to
agree
with
the
company
that
the
task
would
not
be
a
principled
one,
but
we
do
think
that
the
task
is
a
principled
one,
and
we
do
think
that
the
flexibility
is
there
in
the
sense
that
the
arbitrator,
just
as
he
can
under
the
steelworkers
trilogy,
but
to
take
into
account
changed
situations
and
changed
equities.
mr.
laurence
gold
but
that
is
the
type
of
clause
depending
on
the
situation
which
may
not
survive.
obviously,
if
the
clause
is
contrary
to
law,
let’s
take
the
wiley
situation.
in
wiley,
the
unit
of
interscience
employees,
that
was
the
entity
that
was
merged
into
wiley
was
40
people,
and
if
we
take
--
those
40
people
were
transferred
into
a
unit
which
already
had
300,
then
there
would
be
no
duty
to
recognize,
and
obviously
to
the
extent
that
you
have
any
other
such
clauses
that
don’t
survive
the
change
because
of
that
type
changed
circumstances
--
mr.
laurence
gold
you
mean
grievance?
mr.
laurence
gold
filing
grievances
and
so
on?
mr.
laurence
gold
we
would
assume
that
the
process
would
continue
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
the
union
representatives
for
the
people
--
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
because
it
seems
to
us
that
the
very
point
of
your
decision
in
lion
dry
goods
was
that
there
can
be
situations
in
which
the
employer
treats
on
a
“members
only”
representative
basis,
and
in
a
situation
in
which
the
union
doesn’t
have
a
majority,
that
would
be
the
result
of
a
wiley
holding.
mr.
laurence
gold
well
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
your
honor,
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes
sir.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
your
honor.
in
golden
state
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
your
honor.
in
golden
state,
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out,
that
i’m
reading
the
reproduction
of
this
passage
from
the
golden
state
opinion
which
is
the
most
recent
successorship
case.
although,
again
one
of
arising
of
a
different
context
since
our
view
that
each
of
these
areas
are
discreet,
but
they
throw
a
cross
light
on
each
other.
this
is
on
page
28
of
our
brief,
blue
brief.
for
example,
because
the
purchaser
is
not
obligated
by
the
act
to
hire
any
of
the
predecessor’s
employees
c.
burns,
the
purchaser
if
it
does
not
hire
or
any,
or
a
majority
of
those
employees
will
not
be
bound
by
an
outstanding
audit
to
bargain
issued
by
the
board
against
the
predecessor,
nor
by
any
order
tied
to
the
continuance
of
the
bargaining
agent
in
the
unit
involved,
and
that
is
a
position
which
we
understand
and
accept.
the
act
does
not
require
an
employer
to
hire
anyone,
and
that
is
what
this
says.
an
employer,
as
long
as
he
doesn’t
act
for
any
to
union
reasons
has
the
right
to
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
your
honor,
what
i’m
trying
to
say
is
that
there
is
no
statutory
obligation
prior,
but
there
maybe
a
contractual
obligation
to
hire.
contracts
are
--
the
contractual
obligations
are
not
equal
to
statutory
obligations.
there
are
different
concepts
of
successorship
here
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
it
may
or
may
not
be.
there
are
situations
in
which
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
there’s
no
duty
to
bargain
in
the
sense
that
there
is
--
under
the
scheme,
the
duty
to
bargain
with
sense
to
negotiate
under
the
scheme,
there
is
a
negotiation
during
the
term.
there
maybe
a
duty
to
recognize
depending
on
--
the
situation
depending
on
the
composition
of
the
work
force,
but
to
say
that
because
in
this
case,
if
the
employer
has
to
hire
the
predecessor’s
employees,
there’s
a
duty
to
recognize,
there
will
always
be,
is
incorrect.
and
i
think
the
wiley
situation
indicates
it.
there
maybe
mergers
which
also
merge
a
small
unit
in
place
into
a
larger
one,
in
that
case,
there
wouldn’t
be
the
duty
to
recognize.
but
way
of
it
is
a
duty
to
hire,
then
the
duty
to
recognize
may
follow
with
it
as
being
a
part
of
the
agreement
that
still
fits.
and
--
mr.
laurence
gold
i
would
not
think
so.
the
very
theory
they
may
have,
to
the
extent
that
they
survived
the
first
arbitration
and
choose
to
be
represented
by
the
employees,
but
at
the
present
time,
howard
johnson
has
hired
them
under
the
common
law
system
under
which
he
can
discharge
him
at
will.
the
only
people
who
the
union
is
seeking
to
represent
and
those
who
have
authorized
to
represent
them,
namely
the
predecessor’s
employees
and
the
policy
of
wiley
is
to
cushion
the
shock
of
the
change
on
most
predecessor’s
employees,
and
to
carry
forward
the
contractual
obligations.
if
the
employer
discharged
them
wrongly,
then
they
deserve
to
be
protected.
mr.
laurence
gold
the
nine
or
any
others
who
chose
to
ask
the
union
to
represent
them.
mr.
laurence
gold
right,
any
new
people
would
choose
to
represent
them,
because
then
you
would
be
in
a
situation
where
you
have
members
on
the
agreement.
but
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
in
terms
of
the
statutory
obligation,
the
contractual
obligation,
i
think
is
simply
illustrated
by
the
case
where
you
have
only
one
employer,
and
an
employe
is
discharged
because
he
gets
on
the
wrong
side
of
his
foreman.
if
he
goes
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
he
doesn’t
get
any
relief
because
the
board
has
no
plenary
authority
to
readdress
unjust
discharges.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he’s
under
an
agreement
and
he
goes
to
an
arbitrator,
he
can
get
relief.
so,
the
fact
that
there
isn’t
a
statutory
obligation
on
an
employer,
which
is
what
burns
holds.
there
is
no
statutory
obligation
which
we
can
extrapolate.
from
8
(a)
5
to
recognize
an
agreement
or
to
hire
employees
doesn’t
mean
that
there
is
no
contractual
obligation.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
that’s
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
that
helps
me
get
back
to
where
i
was
starting
from,
because
i
think
that
that’s
really
the
question
of
what
wiley
says.
and
what
wiley
says
in
the
theory
of
it
is
that
he
point
of
collective
agreements,
and
here
i
quote
the
house
report,
or
paraphrase
the
house
report
on
the
wagner
act
“the
plaintiff
collected
bargaining
is
not
to
start
a
process
which
is
a
means
in
itself,
but
it’s
a
means
to
an
end.”
and
the
end
is
collective
agreements
which
stabilize
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
for
certain
period
of
time.
and
the
practice
of
collective
bargaining,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
warrior
and
gulf,
is
to
attempt
to
elect
a
system
of
self
--
industrial
self
government
which
controls
a
specific
business
enterprise.
it
sets
the
terms
on
which
the
employees
deals
with
each
other,
and
which
they
deal
with
the
employer,
and
it
binds
employees
who
come
into
the
unit
after
the
fact.
it
binds
those
who
would
not
have
supported
the
union
in
the
first
place,
and
indeed
to
push
for
stability
is
so
great,
that
if
the
employees
change
their
mind
during
the
term,
they
can’t
get
a
board
election
in
which
to
express
that,
that’s
the
contract
by
rules.
and
because
of
all
that
in
one
of
the
early
leading
cases
this
court
said,
that
the
collective
agreement
is
analogous
to
a
tariff,
or
to
a
government
utility
rates
which
bind
all
those
who
come
within
its
terms.
the
theory
upon
which
the
parties
operate
is
that
so
long
as
the
business
enterprise
continues,
these
rules
which
has
setup
will
continue,
and
what
mr.
justice
powell
said
for
the
court
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
it’s
beyond
that.
mr.
laurence
gold
it
seems
to
me
it’s
when
does
it
change
in
the
identity
of
the
employer
change
those
rules.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
no,
one
of
the
rules
is
that
the
just
cause
and
seniority
provisions
of
the
agreement
apply.
that
is
probably
the
most
important
aspect
of
the
bargain
from
the
union
and
the
employees'
standpoint.
and
if
--
mr.
laurence
gold
i
do
not
believe
so.
it’s
our
theory
that
the
cases
stand
together,
after
all
in
your
opinion,
you
distinguished
wiley.
our
view
is
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
statutory
obligations
which
can
be
drawn
from
section
8
(a)
(5)
and
the
contractual
obligations
which
can
be
implied
as
a
matter
of
law
just
as
the
basic
duty
of
arbitrators
imply,
and
just
as
a
no
strike
agreement
can
be
implied,
as
this
court
did
in
lucas
flower.
the
very
theory
of
contractual
enforcement
is
that
these
duties
can
be
implied
by
the
court.
and
what
burns
says
is
that
the
board
has
a
more
limited
authority,
but
that
doesn’t
seem
to
us
to
undercut
the
board’s
authority.
indeed,
in
the
afl-cio
brief,
the
(inaudible)
brief.
we
quoted
from
c&c
plywood
decision
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
which
he
draws
the
point
that
when
congress
made
its
decision
to
give
the
courts
the
authority
to
enforce
agreements,
it
rejected
giving
that
authority
to
the
board,
this
is
on
page
6,
because
that
would
be
government
compulsion
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
but
that
authority
given
to
the
courts
isn’t
the
same,
because
the
courts
are
not
deriving
the
obligations
they
state
from
the
statute.
they
are
deriving
them
from
the
contract.
the
contract
is
interpreted
in
the
normal
way
courts
interpret
contracts.
and
i
just
want
to
conclude
by
saying
that
there
are
three
basic
choices
open
in
wiley,
either
the
continuity
with
business
enterprise
the
test
drawn
from
the
understanding
of
collective
agreements
would
apply,
or
else
the
employer
would
be
able
to
choose
or
not
choose
whether
to
be
bound,
and
if
he
were
able
to
choose
or
not
choose
whether
to
be
bound,
that
would
create
an
extraordinary
disparity,
because
the
employees
would
be
at
the
second
employer’s
mercy.
the
value
of
their
bargain
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
he
thought
it
was
a
good
bargain.
if
he
thinks
it’s
a
good
bargain,
he
can
say
“i
accept
it.”
but
if
he
thinks
it’s
a
bad
bargain,
he
can
say
“i
reject
it.”
on
the
other
hand,
the
employees
have
to
take
whichever
way
he
jumps.
and
that
seems
to
us
to
be
completely
inconsistent
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
your
honor,
if
he
is
a
successor
--
mr.
laurence
gold
but
wiley
says
that
by
buying
the
business,
knowing
of
the
agreement
and
continuing
the
business
so
that
it
is
of
continuity,
he
steps
into
the
shoes
of
his
predecessor.
mr.
laurence
gold
that’s
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
exactly.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
some
contracts
do.
i
mean,
the
common
law
rule
is
not
the
only
rule
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
in
burns.
there
are
obligations
which
are
imposed
on
successors,
or
people
who
take
over
business
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
i
want
to
make
--
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
it’s
the
contract
right
in
terms
of
national
labor
policy
in
the
presumptions
and
its
meaning,
and
i
just
want
to
note
that
in
this
case,
there
is
a
successorship
clause.
if
the
predecessor
--
if
the
only
remedy
is
against
the
predecessor,
we
have
a
situation
which
we
think
is
--
which
is
analogous
to
that
in
boeing’s
markets.
all
you
can
get
is
damages,
but
that
isn’t
the
purpose
of
the
labor
law.
the
labor
law
is
opposed
to
the
law
of
commercial
contracts.
specific
performance
is
what
is
sought
when
you
have
an
arbitration
or
its
common
law
and
no
strike
provision,
and
the
only
way
you
can
have
that
is
the
method
employed
by
wiley,
which
is
to
say
that
this
situation
is
not
the
same
as
one
in
which
there
is
no
contract.
there
is
a
contract
and
the
successor
steps
into
it.
and
i
want
to
point
out
how
close
the
continuity
is
in
this
case.
how
johnson
had
a
voice
in
this
business
before
the
change.
there
was
its
franchisee.
before
and
after
the
change,
there
was
a
howard
johnson’s
motel
selling
basically
the
same
things
to
the
same
class
of
costumers.
before
and
after
the
change,
there
was
a
discreet
unit
of
55
people
who
were
working
for
that
employer.
there
was
a
one
minute
hiatus
as
both
mr.
justice
stewart
and
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
yesterday.
if
this
employer
is
in
the
successor,
we
don’t’
know
who
he
is.
and
if
he
is
a
successor,
then
there
was
never
a
break
in
the
contractual
obligations,
and
those
contractual
obligations
were
his
just
as
there
were
his
predecessor’s.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
that’s
right.
i
think
our
first
duty
is
to
show
that
there
is
a
continuity
of
the
business
enterprise
which
makes
it
proper
to
say
the
second
employer
is
a
successor.
where
there
isn’t
a
continuity,
then
he
is
not
a
successor
and
he
is
not
bound
by
the
arbitration
clause,
or
any
of
the
other
potential
obligations
which
are
in
the
agreement.
and
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
your
honor,
because
we
think
that
the
background
of
the
law
is
different
that
if
that
is
the
test,
then
the
very
issue
to
be
are
he
can
control
whether
or
not
there’s
to
be
an
arbitration
by
disregarding
a
potential
obligation,
and
therefore,
that
the
situation
is
different
from
the
situation
under
8
(a)
(5).
under
section
8
(a)
(5),
first
of
all,
there’s
no
obligation,
and
secondly
you
look
to
the
employee
complement
because
you’re
asking
whether
or
not
there
should
be
negotiations
for
new
agreement
whether
there’s
a
duty
to
recognize.
and
the
duty
to
recognize
stands
from
the
employee
free
choice.
employee
free
choice
is
subordinated
to
stability
during
the
term
of
the
agreement,
and
that’s
why
you
don’t
look
to
the
employer-employee
complement
in
a
contract
case,
but
rather
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out,
and
certainly
what
he
said
is
applicable
in
this
case,
you
look
to
continuity
on
the
employer
side,
continuity
in
the
business
enterprise.
and
if
that
is
there,
then
the
duty
to
arbitrate
does
follow.
that
is
the
theory
which
we
are
arguing.
we’re
saying
that
we
have
to
show
the
successorship.
we
have
to
show
a
lack
of
discontinuity.
we
think
we
have
all
sorts
of
continuity
here,
and
once
we
have
that,
then
the
duty
to
arbitration
does
flows
to
conclusion.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
laurence
gold
in
the
contractual
sense.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
don’t
think
that
that’s
a
different
case.
now,
there
have
been
developments
since
you
wrote
your
opinion
which
may
have
some
effect
on
that
case,
the
service
contract
act
amendments
which
are
quoted
in
the
afl-cio
brief.
but
as
a
matter
of
basic
first
impression
in
the
contract
law,
if
there
is
not
continuity
on
the
employer’s
side,
we
do
agree
that
there
isn’t
a
301
obligation.
mr.
laurence
gold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
analytically,
there
are
two
issues
in
this
type
of
case
which
for
convenience
we
refer
through
--
refer
to
throughout
our
brief
as
a
wiley
type
case,
since
that
is
the
leading
authority
in
the
field.
the
first
is
whether
the
second
employer
is
a
successor
as
that
term
has
been
used
in
the
section
301
law
in
the
second
case.
the
second
question
--
mr.
laurence
gold
the
successorship
concept,
mr.
justice
white?
there
was
board
law
on
the
concept
of
successorship
before
this
court
decided
wiley.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
what
i
am
--
what
i
was
trying
to
do
in
answering
your
question
was
say
there
are
antecedents
in
the
board
law
of
the
successorship
concept.
but
it
is
our
view
that
the
section
301
law
of
successorship
is
not
the
same
as
the
board
law,
and
that
the
law
as
declared
in
wiley
is
not
the
same
as
of
the
law
which
had
developed
in
the
board,
either
in
terms
of
the
test
of
successorship
or
in
terms
of
the
consequence
of
a
finding
those
successorship.
mr.
laurence
gold
nothing.
there
are
no
words
in
301
to
which
we
look
for
guidance.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes
--
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
one
is
the
duty
to
bargain
and
the
--
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
and
it
is
our
view
that
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
the
board
law
preceded
in
by
stating
different
rules
at
different
times.
the
board
law
at
the
time
wiley
was
decided
was
that
a
successor
as
the
board
use
that
term
was
not
bound
by
the
agreement.
mr.
laurence
gold
they
reverse
themselves
in
burns.
mr.
laurence
gold
right.
but
this
court
held
that
in
a
301
case,
the
successor
is
bound
by
his
predecessor’s
duty
to
arbitrate.
that
was
the
holding
in
wiley.
mr.
laurence
gold
and
in
burns,
you
again
dealt
with
the
board
law,
which
was
the
duty
to
bargain
law.
now,
i
am
really
not
sure
that
i
have
been
at
all
responsive
to
the
question.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
it
did
not
map
it
out
for
him.
mr.
laurence
gold
no.
there
were
specific
arbitration
issues
which
had
been
posed
in
wiley.
mr.
laurence
gold
you
mean
in
deciding
any
of
those
specific
issues?
mr.
laurence
gold
my
understanding
of
the
direction
in
wiley
is
that
what’s
open
for
the
arbitrator
to
decide
is
whether
those
portions
of
the
agreement
continue
to
be
a
--
to
create
a
subsidy
of
rules
of
the
continuing
business
enterprise.
and
it’s
our
view,
as
stated
in
the
briefs
that
in
doing
that
job,
he
is
to
look
to
change
circumstances
in
the
equity
of
the
situation,
that
what
we
have
here
is
not
something
which
is
sui
generis
but
rather
a
type
of
arbitration
which
was
contemplated
in
the
steelworker’s
trilogy.
in
the
steelworker’s
trilogy,
the
court
emphasized
the
fact
that
the
arbitrator
is
to
take
into
account
changed
circumstances,
even
in
a
situation
in
which
there
are
not
sufficient
changed
circumstances
so
that
the
second
employer
is
not
a
successor
and
not
bound
by
the
arbitration
clause.
there
may
be
factors
which
it
has
to
meet
an
incumbent
upon
the
arbitrative
taken
to
account
in
determining
the
successor’s
obligations.
and
that’s
what
we
think
wiley
directed
the
arbitrators
to
do,
and
that
is
what
they
have
been
doing.
mr.
laurence
gold
we
know
certain
things
about
what
wiley
would
have
said.
first
of
all
--
mr.
laurence
gold
first
of
all,
we
know
that
in
the
view
of
the
wiley
court,
the
merger
situation
was
considered
a
less
likely
one
than
the
assets
acquisition
situation
for
application
of
the
successorship
doctrine,
because
that
is
what
the
court
said.
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
we
do
not
know
precisely
what
they
would
have
said,
but
we
do
know
what
the
general
proposition
that
is
--
mr.
laurence
gold
we
do
not
believe
so.
mr.
laurence
gold
it
has
never
been
so
far
as
we
know
an
element
in
the
section
301
law
of
successorship.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes.
but
section
30
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
we
don’t
know
in
the
sense
that
in
that
case,
we
--
in
that
case,
the
employer,
although
not
originally
over
mind
to
it,
eventually
did
hire
the
employees.
but
we
do
know
that
there
are
certain
basic
principles.
first
of
all,
we
know
that
in
wiley,
the
successorship
test
was
stated
to
be
whether
there
are
any
substantial
indicia
of
continuity
and
that
it
used
the
fact
that
the
second
employer
hired
the
employees
as
saying
that
that
was
evidence
of
continuity,
not
that
it
was
a
necessary
condition.
and
we
do
know
that
the
general
rule
stated
in
wiley
is
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
our
holding
that
the
obligation
to
arbitrate
survived
the
merger,
where
we
to
hold
that
the
fact
of
the
merger
without
more
removed
claims
otherwise
plainly
arbitrable
from
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
clause?
that’s
at
page
554
376
u.s.
well,
the
issue
--
the
claims
--
mr.
laurence
gold
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
to
briefly
put
the
matter
back
in
focus,
this
is
a
section
301
suit
to
compel
arbitration.
the
problem
it
raises
is
whether
the
duty
to
arbitrate
survives
over
a
change
in
the
identity
of
owners,
where
that
change
takes
place
against
the
background
of
a
collective
agreement
enforced
and
is
brought
about
by
negotiations
between
the
first
employer
and
the
purchaser.
at
the
afternoon
recess
yesterday,
i
was
endeavoring
to
respond
to
mr.
justice
white’s
questions
concerning
the
scope
of
wiley
versus
livingston
which
was
also
a
section
301
case
presenting
the
same
issue.
naturally,
wiley
like
every
other
president
leaves
certain
leeways
in
the
law,
but
it
is
a
recent
decision
and
i
hope
we’ll
be
able
to
demonstrate
that
if
rooted
in
basic
precepts
of
the
national
labor
policy,
and
is
not
simply
a
decision
which
can
be
read
to
settle
the
particular
facts
there
before
the
court.
to
understand
its
lessons,
we
believe
it’s
necessary
to
analyze
its
basic
rationale.
firstly,
--
mr.
laurence
gold
there
are
two
aspects
to
that
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
we
look
at
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
agreement
if
one
means
what
are
the
subsequent
obligations
which
the
second
employer
is
bound
by
to
be
essentially
equivalent
to
the
process
of
arbitration
mapped
out
in
the
steelworkers’
trilogy.
namely
that
in
the
arbitration,
the
arbitrator
is
bound
by
the
agreement,
but
he
is
to
take
into
account
changed
circumstances
and
the
different
equities
of
the
parties,
and
to
fulfill
his
role
as
the
expositor
of
the
contractual
law
set
out
in
the
agreement.
naturally,
the
assumption
is
that
there
will
be
more
need
for
a
creative
and
sensitive
application
of
the
agreement
where
there
is
a
new
employer,
because
he
brings
different
insights,
different
presuppositions,
and
he
may
make
certain
changes
within
his
permitted
scope
under
the
managerial
prerogatives
clause
which
this
agreement
has,
which
may
substantially
change
this
situation.
mr.
laurence
gold
it
survives
to
the
extent
that
the
arbitrator
finds
it
to
be
--
to
comport
with
the
changed
situation.
it
is
the
framework,
the
duty
to
arbitrate
survives
and
the
arbitrator
is
to
determine
the
subsequent
obligations
that
survive.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes
sir.
mr.
laurence
gold
the
answer
that
i
was
attempting
to
give
is
that
my
understanding
is
that
he
is
bound
by
the
framework
of
the
contract.
he
cannot
toss
it
over
his
shoulder
and
act
as
a
someone
who
is
making
law,
but
he
can
take
into
account
reasoned
arguments
from
the
second
employer
that
changed
circumstances,
or
different
equities
makes
specific
provisions
inapplicable.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
is
the
role
that
wiley
envisages
and
that’s
what
in
essence
the
arbitrators
have
been
doing
in
the
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
because
if
that
were
not
true,
then
we
would
have
to
agree
with
the
company
that
the
task
would
not
be
a
principled
one,
but
we
do
think
that
the
task
is
a
principled
one,
and
we
do
think
that
the
flexibility
is
there
in
the
sense
that
the
arbitrator,
just
as
he
can
under
the
steelworkers
trilogy,
but
to
take
into
account
changed
situations
and
changed
equities.
mr.
laurence
gold
but
that
is
the
type
of
clause
depending
on
the
situation
which
may
not
survive.
obviously,
if
the
clause
is
contrary
to
law,
let’s
take
the
wiley
situation.
in
wiley,
the
unit
of
interscience
employees,
that
was
the
entity
that
was
merged
into
wiley
was
40
people,
and
if
we
take
--
those
40
people
were
transferred
into
a
unit
which
already
had
300,
then
there
would
be
no
duty
to
recognize,
and
obviously
to
the
extent
that
you
have
any
other
such
clauses
that
don’t
survive
the
change
because
of
that
type
changed
circumstances
--
mr.
laurence
gold
you
mean
grievance?
mr.
laurence
gold
filing
grievances
and
so
on?
mr.
laurence
gold
we
would
assume
that
the
process
would
continue
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
the
union
representatives
for
the
people
--
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
because
it
seems
to
us
that
the
very
point
of
your
decision
in
lion
dry
goods
was
that
there
can
be
situations
in
which
the
employer
treats
on
a
“members
only”
representative
basis,
and
in
a
situation
in
which
the
union
doesn’t
have
a
majority,
that
would
be
the
result
of
a
wiley
holding.
mr.
laurence
gold
well
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
your
honor,
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes
sir.
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
your
honor.
in
golden
state
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
your
honor.
in
golden
state,
mr.
justice
brennan
pointed
out,
that
i’m
reading
the
reproduction
of
this
passage
from
the
golden
state
opinion
which
is
the
most
recent
successorship
case.
although,
again
one
of
arising
of
a
different
context
since
our
view
that
each
of
these
areas
are
discreet,
but
they
throw
a
cross
light
on
each
other.
this
is
on
page
28
of
our
brief,
blue
brief.
for
example,
because
the
purchaser
is
not
obligated
by
the
act
to
hire
any
of
the
predecessor’s
employees
c.
burns,
the
purchaser
if
it
does
not
hire
or
any,
or
a
majority
of
those
employees
will
not
be
bound
by
an
outstanding
audit
to
bargain
issued
by
the
board
against
the
predecessor,
nor
by
any
order
tied
to
the
continuance
of
the
bargaining
agent
in
the
unit
involved,
and
that
is
a
position
which
we
understand
and
accept.
the
act
does
not
require
an
employer
to
hire
anyone,
and
that
is
what
this
says.
an
employer,
as
long
as
he
doesn’t
act
for
any
to
union
reasons
has
the
right
to
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
your
honor,
what
i’m
trying
to
say
is
that
there
is
no
statutory
obligation
prior,
but
there
maybe
a
contractual
obligation
to
hire.
contracts
are
--
the
contractual
obligations
are
not
equal
to
statutory
obligations.
there
are
different
concepts
of
successorship
here
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
it
may
or
may
not
be.
there
are
situations
in
which
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
there’s
no
duty
to
bargain
in
the
sense
that
there
is
--
under
the
scheme,
the
duty
to
bargain
with
sense
to
negotiate
under
the
scheme,
there
is
a
negotiation
during
the
term.
there
maybe
a
duty
to
recognize
depending
on
--
the
situation
depending
on
the
composition
of
the
work
force,
but
to
say
that
because
in
this
case,
if
the
employer
has
to
hire
the
predecessor’s
employees,
there’s
a
duty
to
recognize,
there
will
always
be,
is
incorrect.
and
i
think
the
wiley
situation
indicates
it.
there
maybe
mergers
which
also
merge
a
small
unit
in
place
into
a
larger
one,
in
that
case,
there
wouldn’t
be
the
duty
to
recognize.
but
way
of
it
is
a
duty
to
hire,
then
the
duty
to
recognize
may
follow
with
it
as
being
a
part
of
the
agreement
that
still
fits.
and
--
mr.
laurence
gold
i
would
not
think
so.
the
very
theory
they
may
have,
to
the
extent
that
they
survived
the
first
arbitration
and
choose
to
be
represented
by
the
employees,
but
at
the
present
time,
howard
johnson
has
hired
them
under
the
common
law
system
under
which
he
can
discharge
him
at
will.
the
only
people
who
the
union
is
seeking
to
represent
and
those
who
have
authorized
to
represent
them,
namely
the
predecessor’s
employees
and
the
policy
of
wiley
is
to
cushion
the
shock
of
the
change
on
most
predecessor’s
employees,
and
to
carry
forward
the
contractual
obligations.
if
the
employer
discharged
them
wrongly,
then
they
deserve
to
be
protected.
mr.
laurence
gold
the
nine
or
any
others
who
chose
to
ask
the
union
to
represent
them.
mr.
laurence
gold
right,
any
new
people
would
choose
to
represent
them,
because
then
you
would
be
in
a
situation
where
you
have
members
on
the
agreement.
but
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
in
terms
of
the
statutory
obligation,
the
contractual
obligation,
i
think
is
simply
illustrated
by
the
case
where
you
have
only
one
employer,
and
an
employe
is
discharged
because
he
gets
on
the
wrong
side
of
his
foreman.
if
he
goes
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
he
doesn’t
get
any
relief
because
the
board
has
no
plenary
authority
to
readdress
unjust
discharges.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he’s
under
an
agreement
and
he
goes
to
an
arbitrator,
he
can
get
relief.
so,
the
fact
that
there
isn’t
a
statutory
obligation
on
an
employer,
which
is
what
burns
holds.
there
is
no
statutory
obligation
which
we
can
extrapolate.
from
8
(a)
5
to
recognize
an
agreement
or
to
hire
employees
doesn’t
mean
that
there
is
no
contractual
obligation.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
that’s
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
that
helps
me
get
back
to
where
i
was
starting
from,
because
i
think
that
that’s
really
the
question
of
what
wiley
says.
and
what
wiley
says
in
the
theory
of
it
is
that
he
point
of
collective
agreements,
and
here
i
quote
the
house
report,
or
paraphrase
the
house
report
on
the
wagner
act
“the
plaintiff
collected
bargaining
is
not
to
start
a
process
which
is
a
means
in
itself,
but
it’s
a
means
to
an
end.”
and
the
end
is
collective
agreements
which
stabilize
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
for
certain
period
of
time.
and
the
practice
of
collective
bargaining,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
warrior
and
gulf,
is
to
attempt
to
elect
a
system
of
self
--
industrial
self
government
which
controls
a
specific
business
enterprise.
it
sets
the
terms
on
which
the
employees
deals
with
each
other,
and
which
they
deal
with
the
employer,
and
it
binds
employees
who
come
into
the
unit
after
the
fact.
it
binds
those
who
would
not
have
supported
the
union
in
the
first
place,
and
indeed
to
push
for
stability
is
so
great,
that
if
the
employees
change
their
mind
during
the
term,
they
can’t
get
a
board
election
in
which
to
express
that,
that’s
the
contract
by
rules.
and
because
of
all
that
in
one
of
the
early
leading
cases
this
court
said,
that
the
collective
agreement
is
analogous
to
a
tariff,
or
to
a
government
utility
rates
which
bind
all
those
who
come
within
its
terms.
the
theory
upon
which
the
parties
operate
is
that
so
long
as
the
business
enterprise
continues,
these
rules
which
has
setup
will
continue,
and
what
mr.
justice
powell
said
for
the
court
--
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
it’s
beyond
that.
mr.
laurence
gold
it
seems
to
me
it’s
when
does
it
change
in
the
identity
of
the
employer
change
those
rules.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
no,
one
of
the
rules
is
that
the
just
cause
and
seniority
provisions
of
the
agreement
apply.
that
is
probably
the
most
important
aspect
of
the
bargain
from
the
union
and
the
employees'
standpoint.
and
if
--
mr.
laurence
gold
i
do
not
believe
so.
it’s
our
theory
that
the
cases
stand
together,
after
all
in
your
opinion,
you
distinguished
wiley.
our
view
is
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
statutory
obligations
which
can
be
drawn
from
section
8
(a)
(5)
and
the
contractual
obligations
which
can
be
implied
as
a
matter
of
law
just
as
the
basic
duty
of
arbitrators
imply,
and
just
as
a
no
strike
agreement
can
be
implied,
as
this
court
did
in
lucas
flower.
the
very
theory
of
contractual
enforcement
is
that
these
duties
can
be
implied
by
the
court.
and
what
burns
says
is
that
the
board
has
a
more
limited
authority,
but
that
doesn’t
seem
to
us
to
undercut
the
board’s
authority.
indeed,
in
the
afl-cio
brief,
the
(inaudible)
brief.
we
quoted
from
c&c
plywood
decision
by
mr.
justice
stewart,
in
which
he
draws
the
point
that
when
congress
made
its
decision
to
give
the
courts
the
authority
to
enforce
agreements,
it
rejected
giving
that
authority
to
the
board,
this
is
on
page
6,
because
that
would
be
government
compulsion
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
but
that
authority
given
to
the
courts
isn’t
the
same,
because
the
courts
are
not
deriving
the
obligations
they
state
from
the
statute.
they
are
deriving
them
from
the
contract.
the
contract
is
interpreted
in
the
normal
way
courts
interpret
contracts.
and
i
just
want
to
conclude
by
saying
that
there
are
three
basic
choices
open
in
wiley,
either
the
continuity
with
business
enterprise
the
test
drawn
from
the
understanding
of
collective
agreements
would
apply,
or
else
the
employer
would
be
able
to
choose
or
not
choose
whether
to
be
bound,
and
if
he
were
able
to
choose
or
not
choose
whether
to
be
bound,
that
would
create
an
extraordinary
disparity,
because
the
employees
would
be
at
the
second
employer’s
mercy.
the
value
of
their
bargain
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
he
thought
it
was
a
good
bargain.
if
he
thinks
it’s
a
good
bargain,
he
can
say
“i
accept
it.”
but
if
he
thinks
it’s
a
bad
bargain,
he
can
say
“i
reject
it.”
on
the
other
hand,
the
employees
have
to
take
whichever
way
he
jumps.
and
that
seems
to
us
to
be
completely
inconsistent
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
your
honor,
if
he
is
a
successor
--
mr.
laurence
gold
but
wiley
says
that
by
buying
the
business,
knowing
of
the
agreement
and
continuing
the
business
so
that
it
is
of
continuity,
he
steps
into
the
shoes
of
his
predecessor.
mr.
laurence
gold
that’s
right.
mr.
laurence
gold
exactly.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
some
contracts
do.
i
mean,
the
common
law
rule
is
not
the
only
rule
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
in
his
opinion
in
burns.
there
are
obligations
which
are
imposed
on
successors,
or
people
who
take
over
business
as
a
matter
of
law.
and
i
want
to
make
--
mr.
laurence
gold
no,
it’s
the
contract
right
in
terms
of
national
labor
policy
in
the
presumptions
and
its
meaning,
and
i
just
want
to
note
that
in
this
case,
there
is
a
successorship
clause.
if
the
predecessor
--
if
the
only
remedy
is
against
the
predecessor,
we
have
a
situation
which
we
think
is
--
which
is
analogous
to
that
in
boeing’s
markets.
all
you
can
get
is
damages,
but
that
isn’t
the
purpose
of
the
labor
law.
the
labor
law
is
opposed
to
the
law
of
commercial
contracts.
specific
performance
is
what
is
sought
when
you
have
an
arbitration
or
its
common
law
and
no
strike
provision,
and
the
only
way
you
can
have
that
is
the
method
employed
by
wiley,
which
is
to
say
that
this
situation
is
not
the
same
as
one
in
which
there
is
no
contract.
there
is
a
contract
and
the
successor
steps
into
it.
and
i
want
to
point
out
how
close
the
continuity
is
in
this
case.
how
johnson
had
a
voice
in
this
business
before
the
change.
there
was
its
franchisee.
before
and
after
the
change,
there
was
a
howard
johnson’s
motel
selling
basically
the
same
things
to
the
same
class
of
costumers.
before
and
after
the
change,
there
was
a
discreet
unit
of
55
people
who
were
working
for
that
employer.
there
was
a
one
minute
hiatus
as
both
mr.
justice
stewart
and
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
yesterday.
if
this
employer
is
in
the
successor,
we
don’t’
know
who
he
is.
and
if
he
is
a
successor,
then
there
was
never
a
break
in
the
contractual
obligations,
and
those
contractual
obligations
were
his
just
as
there
were
his
predecessor’s.
mr.
laurence
gold
well,
that’s
right.
i
think
our
first
duty
is
to
show
that
there
is
a
continuity
of
the
business
enterprise
which
makes
it
proper
to
say
the
second
employer
is
a
successor.
where
there
isn’t
a
continuity,
then
he
is
not
a
successor
and
he
is
not
bound
by
the
arbitration
clause,
or
any
of
the
other
potential
obligations
which
are
in
the
agreement.
and
--
mr.
laurence
gold
yes,
your
honor,
because
we
think
that
the
background
of
the
law
is
different
that
if
that
is
the
test,
then
the
very
issue
to
be
are
he
can
control
whether
or
not
there’s
to
be
an
arbitration
by
disregarding
a
potential
obligation,
and
therefore,
that
the
situation
is
different
from
the
situation
under
8
(a)
(5).
under
section
8
(a)
(5),
first
of
all,
there’s
no
obligation,
and
secondly
you
look
to
the
employee
complement
because
you’re
asking
whether
or
not
there
should
be
negotiations
for
new
agreement
whether
there’s
a
duty
to
recognize.
and
the
duty
to
recognize
stands
from
the
employee
free
choice.
employee
free
choice
is
subordinated
to
stability
during
the
term
of
the
agreement,
and
that’s
why
you
don’t
look
to
the
employer-employee
complement
in
a
contract
case,
but
rather
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out,
and
certainly
what
he
said
is
applicable
in
this
case,
you
look
to
continuity
on
the
employer
side,
continuity
in
the
business
enterprise.
and
if
that
is
there,
then
the
duty
to
arbitrate
does
follow.
that
is
the
theory
which
we
are
arguing.
we’re
saying
that
we
have
to
show
the
successorship.
we
have
to
show
a
lack
of
discontinuity.
we
think
we
have
all
sorts
of
continuity
here,
and
once
we
have
that,
then
the
duty
to
arbitration
does
flows
to
conclusion.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
laurence
gold
in
the
contractual
sense.
mr.
laurence
gold
i
don’t
think
that
that’s
a
different
case.
now,
there
have
been
developments
since
you
wrote
your
opinion
which
may
have
some
effect
on
that
case,
the
service
contract
act
amendments
which
are
quoted
in
the
afl-cio
brief.
but
as
a
matter
of
basic
first
impression
in
the
contract
law,
if
there
is
not
continuity
on
the
employer’s
side,
we
do
agree
that
there
isn’t
a
301
obligation.
