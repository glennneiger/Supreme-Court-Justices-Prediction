in
here,
you
have

more

don’t
you?
justice

well,
if
the
arbitrator
isn’t
bound
by
the
contract,
what
framework
does
he
use
to
determine
what
obligations
survive?
justice
william

you
mean
wiley
then
to
say
not
only
there’s
a
duty
to
arbitrate
but
the
framework
of
the
arbitration
is
the
existing
contract?

how
about
those

by

would
they
have
any

you
say
the

is
a

therefore,
there
never

you’ve
still
got
to
make
the
case
for

successorship.
justice
william

you
would
agree
then
that
by
your
test
of

there
wasn’t
