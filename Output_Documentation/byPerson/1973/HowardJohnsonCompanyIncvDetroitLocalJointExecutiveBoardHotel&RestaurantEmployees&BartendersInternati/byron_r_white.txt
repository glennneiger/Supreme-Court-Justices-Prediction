what
is
the
common
statute?
that
is
a
board
construct
i
guess,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
understand
that,
but
i
mean
it
was
--
it’s
a
board,
it’s
an
nlrb
construction
that
came
about
in
applying
the
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there’s
nothing
--
there’s
nothing
in
the
labor
law
expressly
dealing
with
successorship,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
--
the
successorship
concept
is
used
as
a
vehicle
to
apply
a
certain
section
in
the
labor
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
such
as
the
duty
to
bargain?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
whether
you
are
bound
by
a
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
--
the
provision
that
says
you
are
not
bound
by
a
contract,
unless
you
agree
to
it,
is
subject
to
the
board
has
held
before
burns
anyway
that
it
was
subject
to
an
exception
that
the
successor
is
bound
if
he
is
a
successor,
as
defined
by
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
burns,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
nothing
in
wiley
suggested
what
does
the
arbitrator
would
have
open
for
decision
and
what
would
be
the
signpost
for
him
to
proceed
about
under.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
arbitrator
might
have
open
only,
whether
or
not
the
--
only
whether
or
not
the
buyer
or
the
surviving
corporation
promised
--
made
some
promises
along
the
way
that
might
bind
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
what
would
be
open
for
the
arbitrator
to
decide?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
this
in
part
of
your
submission
is
that
if
the
arbitrator
could
decide
to
put
all
41
back
to
work?.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
which
means
that
the
successor
does
not
have
the
right
not
to
hire
that
he
must
perhaps
take
over
the
old
employees?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that’s
because
of
successorship?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
deciding
successorship,
i
take
it
you
put
aside
the
fact
that
he
may
not
have
hired
any
of
the
old
employees.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
just
ask
mr.
tracy,
i
gather
in
your
submission,
had
howard
johnson
taken
on
all
of
predecessor’s
employees,
howard
johnson
still
would
not
be
bound
by
the
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
might
have
had
a
duty
to
argue?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
not
be
bound
at
all
by
the
agreement?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
tracy,
in
most
situations
where
someone
buys
a
company,
buys
the
assets
and
succeeds
and
continues
to
run
the
business.
surely,
that
purchaser
must
take
account
of
other
kinds
of
contracts,
other
kinds
of
obligations
that
the
buyer
has.
in
my
state,
if
you
bought
a
business,
it
didn’t
take
account
of
some
of
the
debts
that
your
seller
owed
and
if
he
didn’t
go
through
certain
procedures
and
give
them
a
chance
to
come
in
and
make
a
claim,
you’re
going
to
be
in
trouble.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
agree
with
that.
i
agree
with
that.
bought
sales
acts
and
things
like
that.
now,
i
take
it
the
union,
the
employees
are
saying
“we’re
the
only
obligees
of
the
seller
that
aren’t
going
to
be
taken
care
of”
in
some
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
your
client
bought
the
business.
he
knew
he
had
a
contract
that
says
it
bound
the
successor.
and
you
wrote
a
letter
and
said
remotely
bound,
but
i
will
buy
them
ever
the
less.
now,
the
suggestion
is,
it’s
a
national
labor
law,
says
that
you
can’t
avoid
that
successorship
clause
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
congress
would
enact
legislation
which
would
make
this
contract
binding
on
successors
such
as
your
client?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
the
approach
in
this
new
service
contract.
justice
byron

so
far
the
most
relevant
provision
is
a
provision
that
says
that
an
employer
isn’t
bound
to
agree
with
the
contract.
that
you

an

of
collective
