justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
understand
this,
mr.
jaworski.
you
don’t
suggest
that
your
right
to
this
evidence
depends
upon
the
president
having
the
name
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so,
for
the
purposes
of
our
decision,
we
could
lay
that
fact
aside,
couldn’t
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
could
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
jaworski.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
president
went
to
a
court.
he
went
to
the
district
court
with
his
motion
to
quash
and
then
he
filed
a
cross-petition
here.
he’s
not
--
he’s
asking
the
court
to
say
that
his
position
is
correct
as
a
matter
of
law.
is
he
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
correct.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he’s
asking
--
he’s
submitting
his
position
to
the
court
and
asking
us
to
agree
with
him.
he
went,
first,
to
the
district
court
and
he
petitioned
in
this
court.
he’s
not
--
he
has,
himself,
invoked
the
judicial
process
and
he
is
committed
to
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
didn’t
he
file
a
motion
to
quash
the
subpoenas
in
the
district
court
or
the
united
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
law.
he’s
making
that
argument
to
a
court.
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
he
is
correct.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
law,
if
his
position
is
correct
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
he
is
the
sole
judge.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he’s
asking
this
court
to
agree
with
that
proposition
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
this
court
will
tell
him
so.
that’s
what
this
case
is
about,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
chronology,
mr.
jaworski?
the
notice
of
appeal
from
judge
sirica’s
order
was
the
first
step
taken
to
get
to
the
court
of
appeals,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
while
that
was
pending,
then
i
gather,
the
president
petitioned
for
mandamus
was
brought.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
the
last
step
was
that
you
filed
the
petition
to
bypass
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
petition
to
bypass
filed,
i
gather,
to
whatever
case
was
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
at
that
time,
the
case
pending
was
both
the
appeal
from
judge
sirica’s
office
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
president’s
petition
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
which
you
feel
they
are
not
two
cases?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet,
you
could
bring
each
up
separately
if
you
so
chose.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
there’re
two
cases.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
you’re
right
that,
at
any
event,
judge
sirica’s
order
was
an
appealable
order.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you’re
correct
in
that
submission,
do
we
ever
have
to
reach
any
issues
raised
by
the
mandamus?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it’s
not
important.
what
does
consensus
mean,
unanimous?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it
when
you
make
reference
to
this
you
are,
in
effect,
suggesting
that
your
position
is
certainly
different
than
if
a
united
states
attorney
were
prosecuting
this
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
jaworski.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
quasi-independent
in
the
sense
of
an
agency?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
term
“executive
privilege”
an
ancient
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
the
term
“executive
privilege”
an
ancient
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
reynolds,
the
court
ended
up
treating
the
assertion
of
privilege
there
as
an
evidentiary
privilege,
but
it
did
allude
to
the
fact
that
there
was
a
constitutional
question
and
said
the
court
wasn’t
reaching
it,
as
i
recall.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
really
what
you
mean,
isn’t
it,
you
think
that
the
order
of
judge
sirica
should
be
vacated
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
set
aside.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
quite
different
from
dismissing
the
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it’s
a
political
question
here
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it’s
a
political
question
in
the
district
court.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
been
pointing
to
me
that
we’re
brought
into
it
by
deciding
this
case.
how
are
we
drawn
into
the
impeachment
proceedings
by
deciding
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
any
number
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
any
number
of
decisions
of
this
court
has
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you’ve
been
arguing
we
have
absolutely
no
authority
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
constitutionally
to
decide
this
case.
