justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no
one
yet
has
ever
suggested
that
if
you’re
in
a
criminal
trial,
conspiracy
trial,
and
some
evidence
is
authored
of
an
out-of-court
statement
of
someone
who’s
alleged
to
be
a
co-conspirator,
that
it’s
enough
for
the
prosecution
to
then
show
that
the
grand
jury
had
named
him
the
co-conspirator.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
never
gets
you
or
will
never
get
you
over
the
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
then
that
was
the
point.
that
was
the
direction
of
your
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
understand
that.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
thought
we
have
put
that
issue
aside
a
while
ago.
i
just
don’t
understand
what
relevance
it
is
to
this
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
st.
clair,
do
you
suggest
then
that
even
if
the
prosecutor
could
get
this
from
a
normal
third
party
witness,
he
can’t
get
it
from
the
president
because
of
executive
privilege,
that
there
must
be
a
further
showing
beyond
the
relevance
showing
17c?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
your
answer
is
yes,
isn’t
it,
that
there
is
a
further
showing
necessary?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
how
does
a
district
court
go
about
to
decide
a
question
like
that
in
advance
of
trial
without
it
unless
the
prosecutor
lays
out
his
entire
evidence
and
says
“it’s
my
judgment
that
this
is
evidence.
without
this
evidence,
i
might
loose
the
case.”
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
you
would
suggest
that
he
would
have
to
do
that.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
must
say
that
while
i’ve
got
you
interrupted,
i
want
to
make
something
else.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
it’s
related
to
this.
no
matter
how
absolute
the
executive
privilege
is
that
you
claim
on
behalf
of
the
president,
i
assume
you
are
talking
about
conversations
to
which
the
privilege
would
apply.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
is
it
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
wouldn’t
suggest
that
every
conversation
the
president
had
while
he
was
in
office
would
be
subject
to
executive
privilege.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
has
to
be
in
the
course
of
his
duties
as
president.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
carrying
out
his
duties
as
president
as
under
the
constitution.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
i
don’t
suppose
if
he
was
talking
with
one
of
his
aids,
mr.
haldeman
and
mr.
ehrlichman,
about
an
investment
of
his
out
in
california
or
some
other
place.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
you
wouldn’t
suggested
that
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
how
about
conversations
about
a
campaign,
about
the
nixon
campaign?
now,
that’s
hardly
quite
an
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it’s
very
close
to
the
--
yes,
this
is
very
close
to
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
very
close
to
executing
the
laws
of
the
united
sates
and
running
a
political
campaign.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
so
conversations
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
conversations
about
that
subject
matter
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
know
but
shouldn’t
you
--
shouldn’t
the
president
have
to
say
at
least
even
if
the
privilege
is
as
absolute
as
you
say
it
is,
shouldn’t
he
at
least
have
to
say
i
believe
or
assert
that
the
executive
privilege
applies
to
this
tape
because
this
conversation
is
in
the
course
of
the
performance
of
his
duties
as
president?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
haven’t
done
that
either,
have
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
automatically
say
every
conversation
about
watergate
is
in
the
course
of
the
performance
of
the
duties
of
the
president
of
the
united
states?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
is
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
how
about
--
do
you
concede
or
view
--
what
is
your
view
of
the
privilege
with
respect
to
whether
it
reaches
factual
assertions
in
a
conversation?
the
difference
that
was
made
in
the
mink
case
and
another
with
respect
to
opinions
and
judgments
as
distinguished
from
the
facts?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
statutory
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
what
is
your
view?
would
you
say
if
a
conversation
is
merely
a
recitation
of
fact,
it
is
still
covered
by
executive
privilege
or
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
hasn’t
got
much
to
do
with
the
decision
making
process,
just
pure
cold
facts.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
st.
clair,
just
to
pinpoint
another
issue,
let’s
assume
for
the
moment
that
we
didn’t
agree
with
you
on
your
test
of
privilege
and
let’s
just
assume
that
the
only
issue
that
was
left
in
the
case
was
the
17c
issue.
now
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
because?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
think
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
suppose
there
are
two
parts
to
the
question.
one,
how
much
of
a
showing
does
he
have
to
make
as
to
what’s
on
--
what
might
be
on
the
tape
and,
secondly,
if
that
matter
that
he
claimed
is
on
the
tape
is
on
the
tape,
is
that
relevant
and
admissible
under
17c?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but,
mr.
st.
clair
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
can’t
put
an
impossible
task
on
someone
who
wants
a
subpoena
against
a
third
party
witness
or
against
anybody
else.
as
to
showing
what
is
precisely
on
innocent
documents,
i
would
suppose.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
here
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he’s
never
listened
to
the
tapes.
he
doesn’t
know
precisely
what’s
on
them.
you
would
say
that
he
could
never
subpoena
a
tape
unless
he
had
already
gotten
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
that
isn’t
what
17
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
cases
you’re
talking
about
are
cases
where
a
defendant
sought
discovery
of
evidence
from
the
--
or
sought
material
in
a
prosecutor’s
files.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
once
he
gets
through
with
the
grand
jury,
he
shouldn’t
be
using
a
subpoena
to
develop
his
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
that’s
the
practice
in
the
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
lacovara,
judge
sirica
found
that
you
had
satisfied
the
requirements.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
what’s
the
scope
of
our
review?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what’s
our
standard
of
appellate
review?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
clearly
erroneous?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
about
the
standard?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
based
on
the
standard
he
followed,
what
about
the
basic
standard
of
17c?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
government
is
in
agreement
that
the
standards
of
iozia
must
be
satisfied
in
this
case
under
17c?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
that’s
what
i’m
asking
you.
what
is
your
position?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
the
parties
are
not
in
agreement
at
all?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
mean
a
necessity
standard?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
what
about
mr.
st.
clair’s
argument?
under
17c
you
can’t
possibly
satisfy
its
requirements
because
you
don’t
know
what’s
in
the
tapes.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
lacovara,
i
don’t
think
it’d
be
very
hard
to
understand
the
developments
of
a
showing
at
the
trial
for
purposes
of
evidence
that
certain
people
are
co-conspirators
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
for
purposes
of
introduction
of
evidence.
but,
that’s
a
little
different
question
than
the
relevance
of
grand
jury
having
come
to
that
conclusion.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
may
be
so
but
even
if
they
named
it
in
the
indictment,
that
isn’t
enough
on
which
to
base
the
introduction
of
out-of-court
statements
by
an
unindicted
co-conspirator.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you
say
it
was?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
isn’t
it
your
position
that
it
was
independently
of
the
naming
of
the
president
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no
