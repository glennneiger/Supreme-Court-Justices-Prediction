mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
march
1
last,
united
states
district
court
grand
jury,
set
it
here,
returned
an
indictment
against
seven
defendants
charging
various
offenses
including
among
them
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
and
also
to
obstruct
justice.
john
mitchell,
one
of
the
defendants,
was
a
former
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
and
also
chairman
of
the
committee
to
reelect
the
president.
another,
h.r.
haldeman,
was
the
president’s
chief
of
staff.
another,
john
ehrlichman,
was
assistant
to
the
president
for
economic
--
for
domestic
affairs.
the
others
were
either
on
the
president’s
staff
or
held
responsible
positions
on
the
reelection
committee.
in
the
course
of
its
deliberations,
the
grand
jury
voted
unanimously
with
19
members
concurring
that
the
course
of
events
in
the
formation
and
continuation
of
the
conspiracy
was
such
that
president
nixon,
among
a
number
of
others,
should
be
identified
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator
in
the
bill,
particular
as
to
be
filed
in
connection
with
the
pretrial
proceedings.
now,
although
this
particular
decision
and
determination
on
the
part
of
the
grand
jury
occurred
in
february,
it
was
a
well-kept
secret
for
two-and-a
half
months.
the
grand
jury,
of
course,
knew
it.
the
members
of
the
prosecution
staff
knew
it.
it
was
done
so
to
avoid
affecting
the
proceedings
in
a
house
judiciary
committee.
it
was
so
kept
during
these
two-and-a
half
months
until
it
became
necessary
to
reveal
it
as
a
result
of
the
president’s
motion
to
quash
a
subpoena,
as
i
will
indicate
subsequently
in
my
argument.
now,
to
obtain
addition
evidence
which
the
special
prosecutor
has
good
reason
to
believe
is
in
the
possession
of
and
under
the
control
of
the
president
and
which
it
is
believed
by
the
special
prosecutor
as
quite
important
to
the
development
of
the
government’s
proof
at
the
trial
in
united
states
versus
mitchell.
a
special
prosecutor,
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
moved
for
a
subpoena
duces
tecum.
and,
it
is
the
subpoena
here
in
question.
the
district
court
ordered
the
subpoena
to
issue
returnable
on
may
2
and
the
subpoena,
of
course,
called
for
the
production
of
tape
recordings
in
advance
of
september
9,
1972
which
is
a
trial
date.
and,
this
was
done
to
allow
time
for
litigation
in
the
event
litigation
was
to
ensue
over
the
production
of
the
tapes
and
also
for
transcription
and
authentication
of
any
tape
recordings
that
were
produced
in
response
to
the
subpoena.
on
april
30,
the
president
released
to
the
public
and
submitted
to
the
house
judiciary
committee
1,216
pages
of
edited
transcripts
of
43
conversations
dealing
with
watergate.
portions
of
20
of
the
subpoenaed
conversations
were
included
among
the
43.
then,
on
may
1,
the
president
advised
counsel
to
file
a
special
appearance,
a
formal
claim
of
privilege,
and
a
motion
to
quash
a
subpoena.
now
for
the
united
states
to
conduct
a
full
and
appropriate
hearing
on
a
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena,
it
became
necessary
to
reveal
the
grand
jury’s
finding
regarding
the
president.
and,
this
was
first
done
by
the
special
prosecutor
calling
on
the
chief
of
staff,
general
alexander
haig,
and
the
president’s
counsel,
mr.
st.
claire,
and
advising
them
of
what
had
occurred
two-and-a
half
months
prior.
and
then,
on
the
following
morning,
advising
judge
rico
of
what
had
occurred
in
camera
and
pointing
out
at
the
necessity
of
this
being
used
in
connection
with
the
arguments
on
a
motion
to
quash
because
of
their
relevance
and
the
necessity
of
these
matters
being
made
a
part
of
the
proceeding.
now,
the
special
prosecutor
joined
counsel
for
the
president
in
urging
that
matter
be
heard
in
camera,
which,
was
done.
three
of
the
defendants
had
joined
the
special
prosecutor
in
moving
for
the
subpoena.
all
of
the
defendants,
at
the
time
of
argument
in
camera
to
judge
sirica,
opposed
the
motion
to
quash.
mr.
leon
jaworski
the
only
relevance,
mr.
justice,
lies
in
it
being
necessary
to
show
under
rule
17c
that
there
is
some
relevance
to
the
material
that
we
were
seeking
to
subpoena,
and
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct,
sir,
but
it
was
felt
it
would
be
necessary
to
show
why.
and,
in
order
to
prove
this
conspiracy
and
in
order
to
provide
all
of
the
links
in
the
conspiracy,
it
was
deemed
necessary
to
show
that
the
president
or
his
name
was
indicted
co-conspirator
and
also
that
there’s
prudence.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
sir.
that
is
not
correct,
sir.
it
became
very
important,
mr.
justice,
for
us
to
have
that
as
a
part
of
proceedings
so
that
we
could
use
the
various
links
in
the
testimony,
so
as
to
show
that
the
conversations
were
such
as
to
make
one
admissible
as
against
a
co-conspirator.
mr.
leon
jaworski
the
grand
jury
sent
nothing
of
an
accusatory
nature
to
the
house
committee.
no,
sir,
what
the
grand
jury
sent
to
the
house
committee
was
the
evidence
that
had
been
accumulated
and
it,
very
carefully,
excised
from
it
anything
by
way
of
the
grand
jury’s
interpretation
or
anything
along
that
line,
mr.
justice.
now,
in
its
opinion
and
order
of
may
20,
the
district
court
first
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
it’s
true
that
it
admits
some
evidence
that
would
otherwise
not
be
admissible.
mr.
leon
jaworski
there’s
no
question
about
that,
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
right,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
right,
sir.
but,
in
order
to
present
the
full
picture
and
in
order
to
present,
that
also
was
a
part
of
it.
district
court
denied
the
motion
to
quash
and
the
motion
to
expunge
had
also
been
filed.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
and
we
don’t
so
contend.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
this
was
in
connection
with
the
subpoenaing
of
this
evidence,
mr.
justice.
in
other
words,
this
was
in
connection
with
showing
that
we
had
the
right
to
this
evidence.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
and
that
was
the
point.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
sir,
of
course
not.
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
do
suggest
that
it
makes
a
prima
facie
case.
and
i
think,
under
the
authorities,
it
so
does.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
what
i
was
really
doing
in
pointing
to
that
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes.
primarily
was
an
order
to
show
a
reason
for
the
grand
jury’s
action.
there
is
also
before
this
court
a
motion
to
expunge
the
act
of
the
grand
jury
in
naming
the
president
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator.
and,
i
was
trying
to
lay
before
the
court
the
entire
situation
that
warranted
that
action.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
we
certainly
point
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
we
certainly
make
that
as
one
of
the
points,
which,
i
intend
to
discuss
that
later.
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
don’t
say
that
it
foreclose
this.
what
i
think
we
suggest
is
that
it
does
present
a
situation
here.
that
should
not
make
the
application
of
executive
privilege
appropriate.
we
do
say
that.
mr.
leon
jaworski
prima
facie,
that’s
correct.
but
when
you
get
to
the
matter,
mr.
justice
powell,
of
balancing
interests
we
do
feel
that
that
particular
situation
is
a
factor
that
is
important.
and,
this
is
why
we
laid
stress
on
it.
the
court’s
order,
of
course,
was
to
deliver
to
the
court
the
originals
of
all
subpoenaed
items
as
well
as
an
index
analysis
of
those
items,
together
with
taped
copies
of
those
portions
of
the
subpoena
recordings
for
which
transcripts
had
been
released
to
the
public
by
the
president
on
april
30.
now,
this
case
presents
for
review
the
action
of
the
lower
court.
now
may
i,
before
i
get
to
the
jurisdictional
points,
briefly
state
what
we
consider
to
be
a
bird’s
eye
view
of
this
case.
now
invest
in
almost
500
pages
of
briefs,
when
boiled
down,
this
case
really
presents
one
fundamental
issue.
who
is
to
be
the
arbiter
of
what
the
constitution
says?
basically,
this
is
not
a
novel
question,
although
the
factual
situation
involved
is,
of
course,
unprecedented.
there
are
primary
questions
to
be
sure.
but
in
the
end,
after
the
rounds
have
been
made,
we
return
to
face
these
flaring
facts
that
i
want
to
briefly
review
for
the
final
answer.
in
refusing
to
produce
the
evidence
sought
by
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
in
the
criminal
trial
of
seven
defendants,
among
them,
former
chief
of
aids
and
dubieties,
the
president
invokes
the
provisions
of
the
constitution.
his
counsel’s
brief
is
replete
with
references
for
the
constitution
as
justifying
his
position.
and
in
his
public
statement,
as
we
all
know,
the
president
has
embraced
the
constitution
that’s
offering
him
support
for
his
refusal
to
supply
the
subpoenaed
tapes.
now,
the
president
may
be
right
in
how
he
reads
the
constitution.
but,
he
may
also
be
wrong.
and
if
he
is
wrong,
who
is
there
to
tell
him
so?
and
if
there’s
no
one,
then
the
president,
of
course,
is
free
to
pursue
his
course
of
erroneous
interpretations.
what
then
becomes
of
our
constitutional
form
of
government?
so
when
counsel
for
the
president,
in
his
brief,
states
that
this
case
goes
to
the
heart
of
our
basic
constitutional
system,
we
agree
because,
in
our
view,
this
nation’s
constitutional
form
of
government
is
in
serious
jeopardy.
if
the
president,
any
president,
is
to
say
that
the
constitution
means
what
he
says
it
does
and
that
there
is
no
one,
not
even
the
supreme
court,
to
tell
him
otherwise
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes?
mr.
leon
jaworski
he’s
saying
his
position
is
correct
because
he
interprets
the
constitution
that
way.
mr.
leon
jaworski
this
is
what
he
says
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
that’s
not
entirely
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leon
jaworski
while
the
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena
in
sirica
has
also
taken
the
position
that
we
have
no
standing
in
this
court
to
have
this
issue
heard.
mr.
leon
jaworski
so
that,
of
course,
this
court
could
then
not
pass
upon
the
constitutional
question
of
how
he
interprets
the
constitution
if
his
position
were
correct,
but
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
right,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
right.
mr.
leon
jaworski
but
what
i’m
saying
is,
if
he
is
the
sole
judge
and
he
is
to
be
considered
the
sole
judge
and
he
is
in
error
in
his
interpretation,
then
he
goes
on
being
in
error
in
his
interpretation.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
that’s
what
i
think
the
case
is
about.
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
i
can’t
say
that
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
well
mr.
chief
justice,
in
my
view,
frankly,
it
is
a
position
where
he
says
“a
constitution
says
this
and
nobody
is
going
to
tell
me
what
the
constitution
says”
because,
up
to
this
point,
he
says
that
he
and
he
alone
is
the
proper
one
to
interpret
the
constitution.
now,
there’s
now
way
to
escape
that
because
the
briefs
definitely
point
that
out
time
after
time.
mr.
leon
jaworski
it
may
be,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
right,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
alright,
sir.
that
is
a
very
good
beginning
point
but,
of
course,
other
things
have
needed
to
be
discussed
as
much
as
they’ve
been
raised.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that
is
correct,
sir,
and
we
do
point
to
the
authorities
to
show
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
situation
here.
i
do
think
that
it’s
proper,
as
much
as
i
regret
to
have
to
do
it,
to
point
that
the
president’s
interpretation
of
what
his
action
should
be
in
these
particular
set
of
circumstances
as
one
that
really
requires
judicial
intervention,
perhaps
more
so
than
a
normal
one
would.
i
think
that
we
realize
that
there
is
at
steak
the
matter
of
the
supplying
of
evidence
that
relates
to
the
due
form
of
close
aids
and
dubieties.
i
think
we’re
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
president
had
publicly
stated
that
he
believed
that
these
two
aids
of
his,
mr.
haldeman
and
mr.
ehrlichman
would
come
out
alright
in
the
end.
added
to
that,
the
fact
that
the
president
has
a
sensitivity
or
own
involvement
is
also
a
matter
that
calls
for
the
exercise
of
the
question
to
which
mr.
justice
douglas
alluded
as
one
that
is
somewhat
unusual.
turning
now
to
jurisdiction,
before
the
court
are
the
two
questions
of
statutory
jurisdiction.
the
court
directed
the
parties
to
brief
and
argue.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
we
do,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
we
say
it’s
here
not
only
because
of
the
appeal
itself,
but
also
because
of
the
petition
for
mandamus.
now
we
did,
mr.
justice,
discussed
that
in
one
of
the
briefs.
now,
it
may
be
that
it
wasn’t
originally
when
we
filed
the
original
brief
on
jurisdiction.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
we
did
in
the
--
it
was
in
the
footnote
on
page
2
of
the
petitioner
for
writ
of
certiorari,
mr.
justice.
well,
i
would
think
so
but
there
really
is
no
issue
between
the
parties
here
on
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
i
mean,
there’s
no
argument
as
between
the
parties
on
it.
and,
while
of
course
the
parties
can’t
agree
on
it,
i
must
say
that
on
three
different
bases
the
jurisdiction
does
exist
as
we
see
it.
now,
i
am
not
yet
getting
to
the
question
of
the
intra-executive
matter
that
has
been
raised
but
i
am
discussing
now
the
statutory
basis
of
jurisdiction,
and
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
to
answer
your
question
directly,
sir,
this
is
correct.
we
are
standing
upon
not
only
the
matter
that
this
is
an
appeal
that
properly
had
been
in
the
court
of
appeals
and,
for
that
reason,
has
been
moved
up
here
properly
under
1254-1.
we
also
say
that
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
petition
and
cross-petition
under
1254-1
because
it
present
for
review
all
questions
raised
by
the
president’s
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus.
and
then
we
also
say
that,
in
addition
to
that,
the
all
writs
act
gives
this
court
jurisdiction
to
proceed.
mr.
leon
jaworski
as
far
as
i
know,
he’s
not,
no,
sir.
in
fact,
i’m
sure
he’s
not.
mr.
leon
jaworski
but
it
was
brought
up
by
the
president
in
their
petition
for
mandamus
and
that’s
right.
that’s
the
way
it
got
into
this
court.
it
raises
the
same
questions
actually
that
were
raised
on
the
matter
that
we
brought
upon.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s,
i
believe,
right,
sir
and
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
right,
sir.
yes.
mr.
leon
jaworski
right,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
right,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
mandamus,
correct.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
sir.
they
raise
the
same
questions
but
that’s
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
could
have,
sir,
yes.
mr.
leon
jaworski
but
in
as
much
as
they
present
the
same
questions,
it
occurred
to
us
that
it
was
appropriate
to
rely
upon
the
jurisdiction
as
to
both
of
them.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
it
is
--
i
don’t
have
the
record
before
me
but,
i
must
say
and
i
will
not
make
an
outright
representation
that
judge
sirica
is,
and
that’s
why
i
hesitated
a
few
minutes
ago,
was
made
a
party
after
all
that
was
brought
up
by
the
president.
but,
i
am
advised
by
a
note
just
passed
to
me
by
mr.
lacovara
that
judge
sirica
is
a
party
to
that
proceeding.
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
don’t
know
of
anyone
representing
him
here,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leon
jaworski
so
far
as
i
know,
none.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
it
would
not.
we
were
pointing
out
that
the
jurisdiction
rests
on
a
three-prong
basis.
mr.
leon
jaworski
it’s
not,
no,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct,
sir.
we,
however,
were
pointing
out
that
the
same
issues
really
were
raised
by
it
if
the
petitioner
is
properly
before
the
court.
now,
if
there
are
no
further
questions
on
the
matter
of
statutory
jurisdiction,
i
would
like
to
pass
to
the
intra-executive
dispute.
first,
we
recognize,
of
course,
that
jurisdiction
cannot
be
waived
and
nothing
that
is
presented
here
is
with
the
idea
of
suggesting
even
remotely
that
there
is
any
waiver
with
respect
to
the
questions
of
jurisdiction.
but,
we
do
say
that
the
contention
is
that
there
is
an
intra-executive
dispute
and,
for
that
reason,
this
court
cannot
pass
up
on
these
questions
as
not
sound.
before
discussing
the
case
as,
however,
i
think
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
us
to
undertake
the
bases
in
the
right
perspective.
let
me
say,
first,
that
we
stand
upon
two
bases.
first,
that,
actually,
the
orders
that
were
entered
creating
the
office
of
the
special
prosecutor
and
delineating
his
authority,
even
the
original
order
at
the
time
that
my
predecessor
was
acting
as
special
prosecutor
had
the
force
and
effect
of
law.
we
also
point
to
the
fact
that
the
arrangement
made
itself
with
the
acting
attorney
general
that
i
made,
if
i
may
point
to
it,
and
one
reason
i
have
no
resonance
in
discussing
the
facts
is
because
the
facts
are
undisputed.
there
has
been
no
dispute
raised
as
to
just
what
actually
transpired.
the
situation
is
one
of
the
arrangements
itself
which
the
acting
attorney
general
points
to,
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
independence
having
been
discussed
by
him
with
the
president.
thus,
meaning
that
the
president,
himself,
had
approved
the
setting
up
of
this
particular
office
and
the
rights
and
the
responsibilities
that
it
has
under
the
charter.
now,
let
me
--
we
set
this
out
in
the
appendix,
of
course,
pointing
precisely
to
what
the
authority
and
responsibilities
and
obligations
of
the
special
prosecutor
are.
one
of
the
expressed
duties
that’s
delegated
to
the
special
prosecutor
is
that
he
shall
have
full
authority
for
investigating
and
prosecuting,
among
others,
allegations
involving
the
president.
and
a
delegation
of
authority
expressly
states
in
particular
the
special
prosecutor
shall
have
full
authority
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
contest
the
assertion
of
executive
privilege
or
any
other
testimonial
privilege.
now
in
the
instance
of
my
appointment,
unlike
the
appointment
that
had
been
made
prior
thereto,
there
was
an
amended
order
and
it
referred
to
assurances
given
by
the
president
to
the
attorney
general
that
the
president
will
not
exercise
his
constitutional
powers
to
affect
the
stories
of
the
special
prosecutor
or
to
limit
the
independence
that
he’s
hereby
given,
and
that
he
will
not
be
removed
from
his
duties
except
for
extraordinary
improprieties
on
his
part
and
without
the
president’s
first
consulting
the
majority
and
the
minority
leaders
and
the
chairman
in
ranking
the
minority
members
of
the
judiciary
committees
and
the
senate
and
house
representatives,
and
ascertaining
that
their
consensus
is
in
accord
with
the
proposed
action.
and
then,
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
special
prosecutor
will
not
be
limited
without
the
president’s
first
consulting
with
such
members
of
congress
and
ascertaining
that
their
consensus
is
in
accord
with
his
proposed
action.
now,
at
the
time
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
sir,
it
hadn’t
been
interpreted
by
the
acting
attorney
general
in
conversation
as
meaning
6
of
8.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct,
sir.
i
think
we
have
what
might
be
termed
a
quasi-independent
status
where
they
were
delegated
to
this
particular
office
the
performance
of
certain
functions
and
there’s
no
reason
why
the
president
couldn’t
have
delegated
those
to
us.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes?
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
sir,
for
instance,
as
a
control
of
currency.
he
has
a
state
of
somewhat
similar
to
that.
and,
we
know
that
there
are
suits
brought
between
the
department
of
justice
and
the
controller
just
the
other
day.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
i
didn’t
it.
what
i
meant
was
we
had
an
independent
status
that
was
really
different
from
the
status
of
the
united
states
attorney.
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
thought
that
was
the
way
i
answered
the
question.
now,
i
should
say
that
it’s
interesting
when
the
case
of
nixon
versus
sirica
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
professor
charles
alan
wright,
who
was
then
arguing
the
case
and
who
was
not
on
the
original
brief
but
have
serviced
on
the
reply
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
president,
at
that
time
argued
with
respect
to
the
particular
office
of
the
special
prosecutor.
now,
in
this
instance,
we
have
a
division
of
function
within
the
executive
and
that
my
friend
mr.
cox,
referring
to
mr.
archibald
cox,
has
been
given
absolute
independence.
it
is
for
him
to
decide
whom
he
will
seek
to
indict.
it
is
for
him
to
decide
to
whom
he
will
give
immunity,
a
decision
that
ordinarily
would
be
made
at
the
level
of
the
attorney
general
or,
in
an
important
enough
case,
at
the
level
or
the
president.
but
the
president’s
present
counsel
in
his
motion
to
quash,
as
he
does
here
accept
the
words
used
are
different
but
the
effect
is
the
same,
is
contending
to
the
court
that
the
president
has
the
right
to
determine
who,
when,
and
with
what
information
individuals
should
be
prosecuted.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
but
the
independent
--
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
distinction
as
to
the
substantive
right
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct,
sir,
yes.
mr.
leon
jaworski
there
is
that
difference,
yes,
but
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
don’t
think
that
the
description
to
which
i
have
pointed
as
to
the
independent
status
of
the
independent
executor
would
be
different
in
the
sirica
case
as
it
would
be
in
this
case.
and,
i
was
barely
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
sir.
i
realize
that.
now
may
i,
however,
indicate
very
briefly,
and
i
know
this
is
an
important
question
but
i
do
feel
that
the
facts
ought
to
be
before
the
court
in
detail,
indicate
just
what
did
transpire
with
respect
to
how
these
particular
regulations,
this
order,
was
interpreted
by
the
president’s
acting
attorney
general
and
also
by
the
attorney
general
designate
and
also
by
the
president,
himself,
and
by
the
president’s
chief
of
staff,
general
haig.
mr.
bork,
in
hearings
at
a
time
when
congress
was
pressing
the
bill
of
an
independent
special
prosecutor,
testified
that
“although
it
is
anticipated
that
mr.
jaworski
will
receive
cooperation
from
the
white
house
in
getting
any
evidence
he
feels,
he
needs
to
conduct
investigations
from
prosecutions.”
it
is
clear
and
understood
on
all
sides
that
he
has
he
power
to
use
judicial
processes
to
pursue
evidence
if
disagreement
should
develop.
it
was
further
pointed
out
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
acting
attorney
general
bork’s
testimony
in
the
house.
mr.
leon
jaworski
after
i
have
been
appointed
and
in
connection
with
the
hearings
on
the
bill
to
establish
an
independent
prosecutor
by
congressional
act.
mr.
leon
jaworski
then,
he
further
said,
i
understand
and
it
is
clear
to
me,
that
“mr.
jaworski
can
go
to
court
and
test
out,”
and
these
are
the
important
words,
“and
test
out
any
refusal
to
produce
documents
on
the
grounds
of
confidentiality.”
and
attorney
general
saxbe,
then
a
designate
who
was
also
present
at
the
time
that
this
matter
was
discussed
and
at
the
time
that
i
accepted
the
responsibilities,
testified
that
i
had
the
right
to
contest
an
assertion
of
executive
privilege
and
stated
that
i
can
go
to
court
at
any
time
to
determine
that.
now
the
president
himself,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
in
announcing
the
appointment
of
a
new
independent
prosecutor,
stated
to
the
nation
that
he
had
no
greater
interest
than
to
see
that
the
new
special
prosecutor
has
the
cooperation
from
the
executive
branch
and
the
independence
that
he
needs
to
bring
about
that
conclusion
of
the
watergate
investigation.
the
president’s
chief
of
staff,
at
the
time
that
this
appointment
was
accepted
and
at
the
time
that
the
new
regulations
were
then
drafted
by
the
acting
attorney
general,
had
assured
me,
and
this
is
a
part
of
the
record,
because
a
letter
was
written
at
the
request
of
senator
hugh
scott
to
the
white
house
as
a
result
of
discussions
that
he
had
with
general
haig
in
which
i
sent
a
copy
of
the
testimony
that
i
had
given
to
the
congressional
committees,
to
the
white
house
so
it
would
fully
be
aware
of
it
and
the
receipt
of
it
was
acknowledged
without
any
change
in
the
testimony.
so,
i
had
been
assured
of
the
right
to
judicial
process
and
by
him
after
he
had
reviewed
the
matter
with
the
president
and
he
came
and
told
me
that
i
would
have
the
right
to
take
the
president
to
court,
and
that
these
were
the
key
words
in
this
arrangement,
and
that
the
right
would
not
be
questioned.
of
course,
this
independence
was
given
to
the
special
prosecutor.
actually,
it
was
but
an
echo
of
public
demand.
and,
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
so,
it
was
the
only
basis
on
which,
after
what
had
occurred
and
a
predecessor
had
been
discharged,
it
was
on
a
basis
on
which
that
special
prosecutor
could
have
felt
that
he
could
come
and
serve
and
undertake
to
perform
these
functions.
it’s
important,
i
think,
to
observe
that
the
counsel
for
the
president
in
his
brief,
by
accepting
the
proposition
that
the
president
and
the
attorney
general
can
delegate
certain
executive
functions
to
subordinate
officers,
implicitly
has
conceded,
so
we
think,
the
validity
of
the
regulations
delegating
prosecutorial
powers
to
the
special
prosecutor.
the
regulations
specifically
provide,
as
you
will
notice
from
the
appendix
and
we
have
set
them
out,
that
the
attorney
general
will
not
counterman
or
interfere
with
the
special
prosecutor’s
decisions
or
actions.
this
is
also
a
part
of
the
charter.
just
to
argue
as
has
been
done
in
these
briefs,
that
the
separation
of
powers
precludes
the
courts
from
entertaining
this
action
because
it
is
the
exclusive
prerogative
of
the
executive
branch,
not
the
judiciary,
to
determine
whom
to
prosecute,
on
what
charges,
and
with
what
evidence,
we
think,
misses
the
point.
what
has
evolved
from
the
regulations,
in
our
view,
is
a
prosecutorial
force
with
certain
exclusive
responsibilities.
and
this
is
why
i
say
that
to
some
degree
it
could
be
described
as
a
quasi-independent
agency.
it’s
not
unlike
our
situation
as
the
case
we
alluded
to
a
few
minutes
ago,
decided
by
the
court
just
a
week
or
so
ago.
it’s
not
unlike
the
case
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
versus
the
united
states.
this
is
the
first
time
that
there
has
been
an
action
brought
by
one
member
of
the
executive
branch
against
another
official
in
the
executive
branch.
and,
we
refer
to
these
cases
in
our
briefs
in
detail.
now,
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
the
president,
at
no
point
of
course,
delegated
to
the
special
prosecutor
the
exclusive
right
to
pass
on
the
question
of
executive
privilege
or
any
other
privilege,
attorney-inclined
privilege,
or
any
other
testimonial
privilege.
what
we
are
merely
saying
is
that
we
have
the
clear
right
to
test
it
in
this
court,
and
this
is
on
what
we
stand.
well
because
of
the
passage
of
time,
if
i
may,
i
think
i
should
get
to
other
discussions
unless
there
are
questions
on
this
particular
point.
passing
to
the
merits,
we
would
say
that
if
there
is
any
one
principle
of
law
that
marbury
versus
madison
cites,
it
is
that
it
is
up
to
the
court
to
say
what
the
law
is
and
almost
to
the
point
of
redundancy
but
necessary
because
it
was
a
landmark
decision.
chief
justice
marshall
reasoned,
we
think,
with
clarity
and
emphasis
that
it
is
emphatically
the
province
and
the
duty
of
the
judicial
department
to
say
what
the
law
is.
and
this
court
of
course,
through
the
years,
has
reaffirmed
consistently
applied
that
rule.
it’s
done
it
in
a
number
of
cases,
in
powell
versus
mccormack,
in
the
youngstown
steel
seizure
case,
and
doe
versus
mcmillan.
and
a
footnote,
i
think
a
very
important
one,
appears
in
that
opinion
when
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
that
while
an
inquiry
such
as
involved
in
a
present
case,
because
it
involves
two
coordinate
branches
of
government,
must
necessarily
have
separation
of
power
implications.
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine
has
not
previously
prevented
this
court
from
reviewing
the
acts
of
congress
even
when,
it
is
pointed
out,
the
executive
branch
is
also
involved.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
speak
to
that.
i
think
one
of
the
cases
that
went
into
greater
detail
and
also
points
out
quite
a
distinguishing
feature
is
the
gravel
case
where
as,
in
the
gravel
case,
the
court
did
hold
that
it
was
appropriate
to
go
into
certain
matters
where
a
privilege
had
been
exercised
on
a
part
of
a
senator
on
behalf
of
his
aid.
there
are
two
things
that
i
believe
clearly
help
us
in
that
decision
and
also
other
decisions
as
far
as
the
questions
here
are
involved.
one
is
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
is
in
the
constitution,
as
is
the
journal
clause.
it’s
in
the
constitution.
it’s
written
in
there.
and,
this
is
what
was
invoked.
i
don’t
find
anything
written
in
the
constitution
and
nothing
has
been
pointed
that
is
a
writing
in
the
constitution
that
relates
to
the
right
of
the
exercise
of
executive
privilege
on
the
part
of
the
president.
another
very
important
thing
that’s
pointed
out
in
that
case
is
that
it
did
involve
an
examination
into
wrongdoing
on
that
part
of
those
who
were
seeking
to
invoke
the
privilege.
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
leon
jaworski
it
has
been
used
over
a
period
of
time.
how
ancient,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i’m
not
in
position
to
say.
but,
certainly,
it
has
been
one
that’s
been
used
over
the
years
but
it
is
not
one
that
i
find
it
a
basis
for
in
the
constitution.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
sir,
but
i
said
it
had
no
basis
for
it
in
the
constitutions
but
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
sir,
and
that
it
has
been
judicially
recognized,
and
appropriately
so,
in
a
number
of
cases.
as
we
see
it,
we
do
not
think
that
it
is
an
appropriate
one
in
this
case
but
we
certainly
do
not,
for
a
moment,
feel
that
it
has
any
constitutional
face.
mr.
leon
jaworski
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
exactly
the
point.
this
court
has
examined
a
number
of
situations
and
in
some
situations
as,
i
think,
was
pointed
out
earlier
where
military
secrets
and
such
as
that
were
involved
or
national
secrets
of
great
importance,
the
court
has
taken
a
good
close
look
and
has
upheld
privilege.
but
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
what
i
mean.
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
it
said
that
it
had
constitutional
overtones
and
i
don’t
know
it
may
have
been
used
but
it
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
but
it
certainly
has
never
placed
it
in
the
constitution,
so
far
as
i’m
aware
of,
and
president’s
counsel
who
have
carefully
examined
the
authorities.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that
the
privilege,
as
recognized
judicially,
may
have
been
tied
into
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine,
we
don’t
deny.
what
we
say
is
that
separation
of
powers
doctrine,
in
the
exercise
and
the
calling
for
executive
privilege,
has
not
been
applied.
in
a
number
of
instances
involving
both
congress
and
involving
also
the
executive,
despite
the
fact
that
even
in
congressional
situations,
speech
and
debate
clause
is
there.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine,
as
was
pointed
to
in
the
doe
versus
mcmillan
case,
has
not
been
permitted
to
stand
in
the
way
of
this
court
examining
it
in
the
standpoint
of
whether
the
executive
privilege
should
be
permitted
or
not.
this
is
what
i’m
saying.
mr.
leon
jaworski
the
issue
of
executive
privilege,
i
should
point
out
here,
is
a
very
narrow
one.
and,
i
think
it’s
important
that
we
bear
this
in
mind.
it
doesn’t
involve
a
very
large
or
broad
privilege
rights.
what
it
really
narrows
down
to
is
somewhat
simple
but
very
important
issue
in
the
administrative
of
criminal
justice
and
that
is
whether
the
president,
in
a
pending
prosecution,
can
withhold
material
evidence
from
the
court
merely
on
his
assertion
that
the
evidence
involves
confidential
communications
and
this
is
what
really
it
gets
down
to.
we
know
that
sovereign
prerogatives
to
protect
the
confidentiality
necessary
to
carryout
responsibilities
in
the
fields
of
international
relations
and
national
defense
are
not,
here,
involved.
and,
there
is
no
claim
of
any
state
secrets
or
that
disclosure
will
have
dire
effect
on
a
nation
or
its
people.
actually,
i
think
when
we
get
to
wayne
and
the
non-disclosure
as
against
disclosure
and
i
think
when
we
begin
to
lay
the
balance
of
interest,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
balance
clearly
lies
in
favor
of
a
disclosure
in
a
situation
such
as
the
circumstance
here.
of
course
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
not
present,
mr.
justice
douglas,
and
there
is
no
question
about
what
the
fifth
amendment
has
very
plainly
written
out
in
the
constitution
and
is
invoked
as
a
clear
constitutional
privilege.
i
think
it
would
be
of
help
if
i
may
point
out
to
the
court,
that
there
is
an
excellent
article
that
we
have
alluded
to
in
our
briefs
by
professor
berger
that
appears
in
a
yale
law
journal
which
discusses
the
ehrenberg
case
at
length
and
also
other
cases
that
have
been
pointed
to
since
the
time
of
that
case.
and,
if
i
may
just
say
very
briefly,
that
summarizes
the
situation
by
saying
that
the
heart
of
marshall’s
opinion
was,
therefore,
just
as
summarized
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
nixon
v.
sirica
case
and
the
tapes
case
that
we
have
talked
about.
the
court
was
to
show
respect
for
the
president’s
reason,
but
the
ultimate
decision
remained
with
the
court.
and
we
are
not
suggesting,
for
a
moment,
here
that
the
matter
of
executive
privilege
should
not
be
looked
into.
this
is
not
--
it
deserves
to
be
tested.
it
should
be
tested
and
we
urge
that
it
be
tested.
but,
the
ultimate
decision
is
not
one
of
saying
that
it
is
absolute
that
it
rests
on
the
constitution
that
it
doesn’t
entitle
anyone
and
doesn’t
authorize
anyone.
it
doesn’t
even
authorize
this
court
to
look
into
it,
because
if
the
courts
are
the
ultimate
interpreters
of
the
constitution
and
can
restrain
congress
to
operate
within
the
constitutional
balance,
they
certainly
shouldn’t
be
empowered
and
lest
to
measure
presidential
claims
of
constitutional
powers.
i
wanted
briefly
to
make
mention
of
the
questions
that
has
been
raised
by
counsel
for
the
president
that
involves
a
motion
to
expunge
the
finding
of
the
grand
jury’s
action
that
the
president
is
to
be
named
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator
along
with
a
number
of
others
when
the
pretrial
proceedings
are
going
into,
and
a
bill
of
particulars
is
being
filed.
and
i
say
that
the
grand
jury’s
finding,
painful
as
it
is
i
think,
on
the
part
of
the
court,
must
be
considered
as
being
valid
and
sufficient
to
show
a
prima
facie.
it
is
sufficient
to
show
a
prima
facie
that
the
president
was
involved
in
the
proceedings
in
the
course
and
the
continuation
of
the
particular
conspiracy
that
was
charged.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
also
another
issue.
but
i
merely
wanted
to
point
out
that
i
believe
that
this
court
would
not
go
into
the
grand
jury’s
findings,
but
it’s
a
prima
facie
matter
and
that
this
court
would
not
go
into
it
for
the
purpose
of
determining
a
matter
of
that
kind.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
i
have
to
agree
with
you,
neither
do
i
see
what
the
relevance
is
of
the
matter
of
saying
that
there’s
another
argument
advanced
here
and
that
is
that
the
president
can’t
be
indicted.
and,
i
don’t
know
what
the
relevance
of
that
is
in
this
case
either,
very
frankly,
because
it
isn’t
before
the
court.
and,
yet,
the
argument
is
made
and
many
pages
of
briefs
are
devoted
to
it.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
this
is
why
i
skipped
the
argument
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
whether
he
could
be
indicted
or
not.
but
as
much
as
the
question
had
been
raised
and
briefed
and
a
motion
exist
before
the
court,
i
have
to
agree
that
it
is
irrelevant
but
it
is
a
part
of
the
case,
and
that’s
the
only
reason
i
alluded
to
it
and
i
have
no
interesting
in
spending
much
time
on
it.
mr.
leon
jaworski
right.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
matter
that,
very
frankly,
has
any
particular
basis
to
it
because
i
don’t
see
how
this
court
could
be
asked
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
right.
mr.
leon
jaworski
not
only
that,
i
think
that
it
has,
to
pinpoint
it
in
our
view,
a
materiality
because
it
does
relate
to
the
question
of
the
proof
that
we
are
seeking
the
relevance
of
the
proof
that
we
are
seeking.
and
this
gets
into,
of
course,
a
discussion
of
matters
that
are
sealed
and
which
i
cannot
discuss
with
the
court.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s,
i
think,
correct.
now
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
that
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
that
is
very
much
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
certainly,
it’s
in
the
case
now
and,
of
course,
which
you
have
reference
too
also,
i’m
sure,
mr.
justice
douglas,
as
the
bray
and
the
jinks,
maryland
versus
bray
and
the
jinks.
and,
this
is
a
part
of
the
case.
however,
it
happens
not
to
be
a
part
of
the
appeal,
although
it
is
a
part
of
the
case.
but
as
far
as
our
position
is
concerned,
it
doesn’t
relate
to
that.
but,
certainly,
it’s
true
that
this
material,
as
we
had
pointed
out
in
our
communications
to
the
president,
may
well
involve
exculpatory
matters
and
we,
time
and
again,
pointed
out
we
wanted
them
not
simply
because
we
felt
that
there
were
matters
that
needed
to
be
developed
in
connection
with
the
prosecution,
but
that
they
could
well
contain
exculpatory
matters.
mr.
leon
jaworski
would
be
available.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
it’s
not
before
this
court.
i
believe,
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i’ll
reserve
the
rest
of
the
time
for
the
close.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
on
march
1
last,
united
states
district
court
grand
jury,
set
it
here,
returned
an
indictment
against
seven
defendants
charging
various
offenses
including
among
them
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
and
also
to
obstruct
justice.
john
mitchell,
one
of
the
defendants,
was
a
former
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
and
also
chairman
of
the
committee
to
reelect
the
president.
another,
h.r.
haldeman,
was
the
president’s
chief
of
staff.
another,
john
ehrlichman,
was
assistant
to
the
president
for
economic
--
for
domestic
affairs.
the
others
were
either
on
the
president’s
staff
or
held
responsible
positions
on
the
reelection
committee.
in
the
course
of
its
deliberations,
the
grand
jury
voted
unanimously
with
19
members
concurring
that
the
course
of
events
in
the
formation
and
continuation
of
the
conspiracy
was
such
that
president
nixon,
among
a
number
of
others,
should
be
identified
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator
in
the
bill,
particular
as
to
be
filed
in
connection
with
the
pretrial
proceedings.
now,
although
this
particular
decision
and
determination
on
the
part
of
the
grand
jury
occurred
in
february,
it
was
a
well-kept
secret
for
two-and-a
half
months.
the
grand
jury,
of
course,
knew
it.
the
members
of
the
prosecution
staff
knew
it.
it
was
done
so
to
avoid
affecting
the
proceedings
in
a
house
judiciary
committee.
it
was
so
kept
during
these
two-and-a
half
months
until
it
became
necessary
to
reveal
it
as
a
result
of
the
president’s
motion
to
quash
a
subpoena,
as
i
will
indicate
subsequently
in
my
argument.
now,
to
obtain
addition
evidence
which
the
special
prosecutor
has
good
reason
to
believe
is
in
the
possession
of
and
under
the
control
of
the
president
and
which
it
is
believed
by
the
special
prosecutor
as
quite
important
to
the
development
of
the
government’s
proof
at
the
trial
in
united
states
versus
mitchell.
a
special
prosecutor,
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
moved
for
a
subpoena
duces
tecum.
and,
it
is
the
subpoena
here
in
question.
the
district
court
ordered
the
subpoena
to
issue
returnable
on
may
2
and
the
subpoena,
of
course,
called
for
the
production
of
tape
recordings
in
advance
of
september
9,
1972
which
is
a
trial
date.
and,
this
was
done
to
allow
time
for
litigation
in
the
event
litigation
was
to
ensue
over
the
production
of
the
tapes
and
also
for
transcription
and
authentication
of
any
tape
recordings
that
were
produced
in
response
to
the
subpoena.
on
april
30,
the
president
released
to
the
public
and
submitted
to
the
house
judiciary
committee
1,216
pages
of
edited
transcripts
of
43
conversations
dealing
with
watergate.
portions
of
20
of
the
subpoenaed
conversations
were
included
among
the
43.
then,
on
may
1,
the
president
advised
counsel
to
file
a
special
appearance,
a
formal
claim
of
privilege,
and
a
motion
to
quash
a
subpoena.
now
for
the
united
states
to
conduct
a
full
and
appropriate
hearing
on
a
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena,
it
became
necessary
to
reveal
the
grand
jury’s
finding
regarding
the
president.
and,
this
was
first
done
by
the
special
prosecutor
calling
on
the
chief
of
staff,
general
alexander
haig,
and
the
president’s
counsel,
mr.
st.
claire,
and
advising
them
of
what
had
occurred
two-and-a
half
months
prior.
and
then,
on
the
following
morning,
advising
judge
rico
of
what
had
occurred
in
camera
and
pointing
out
at
the
necessity
of
this
being
used
in
connection
with
the
arguments
on
a
motion
to
quash
because
of
their
relevance
and
the
necessity
of
these
matters
being
made
a
part
of
the
proceeding.
now,
the
special
prosecutor
joined
counsel
for
the
president
in
urging
that
matter
be
heard
in
camera,
which,
was
done.
three
of
the
defendants
had
joined
the
special
prosecutor
in
moving
for
the
subpoena.
all
of
the
defendants,
at
the
time
of
argument
in
camera
to
judge
sirica,
opposed
the
motion
to
quash.
mr.
leon
jaworski
the
only
relevance,
mr.
justice,
lies
in
it
being
necessary
to
show
under
rule
17c
that
there
is
some
relevance
to
the
material
that
we
were
seeking
to
subpoena,
and
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct,
sir,
but
it
was
felt
it
would
be
necessary
to
show
why.
and,
in
order
to
prove
this
conspiracy
and
in
order
to
provide
all
of
the
links
in
the
conspiracy,
it
was
deemed
necessary
to
show
that
the
president
or
his
name
was
indicted
co-conspirator
and
also
that
there’s
prudence.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
sir.
that
is
not
correct,
sir.
it
became
very
important,
mr.
justice,
for
us
to
have
that
as
a
part
of
proceedings
so
that
we
could
use
the
various
links
in
the
testimony,
so
as
to
show
that
the
conversations
were
such
as
to
make
one
admissible
as
against
a
co-conspirator.
mr.
leon
jaworski
the
grand
jury
sent
nothing
of
an
accusatory
nature
to
the
house
committee.
no,
sir,
what
the
grand
jury
sent
to
the
house
committee
was
the
evidence
that
had
been
accumulated
and
it,
very
carefully,
excised
from
it
anything
by
way
of
the
grand
jury’s
interpretation
or
anything
along
that
line,
mr.
justice.
now,
in
its
opinion
and
order
of
may
20,
the
district
court
first
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
it’s
true
that
it
admits
some
evidence
that
would
otherwise
not
be
admissible.
mr.
leon
jaworski
there’s
no
question
about
that,
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
right,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
right,
sir.
but,
in
order
to
present
the
full
picture
and
in
order
to
present,
that
also
was
a
part
of
it.
district
court
denied
the
motion
to
quash
and
the
motion
to
expunge
had
also
been
filed.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
and
we
don’t
so
contend.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
this
was
in
connection
with
the
subpoenaing
of
this
evidence,
mr.
justice.
in
other
words,
this
was
in
connection
with
showing
that
we
had
the
right
to
this
evidence.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
and
that
was
the
point.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
sir,
of
course
not.
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
do
suggest
that
it
makes
a
prima
facie
case.
and
i
think,
under
the
authorities,
it
so
does.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
what
i
was
really
doing
in
pointing
to
that
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes.
primarily
was
an
order
to
show
a
reason
for
the
grand
jury’s
action.
there
is
also
before
this
court
a
motion
to
expunge
the
act
of
the
grand
jury
in
naming
the
president
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator.
and,
i
was
trying
to
lay
before
the
court
the
entire
situation
that
warranted
that
action.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
we
certainly
point
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
we
certainly
make
that
as
one
of
the
points,
which,
i
intend
to
discuss
that
later.
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
don’t
say
that
it
foreclose
this.
what
i
think
we
suggest
is
that
it
does
present
a
situation
here.
that
should
not
make
the
application
of
executive
privilege
appropriate.
we
do
say
that.
mr.
leon
jaworski
prima
facie,
that’s
correct.
but
when
you
get
to
the
matter,
mr.
justice
powell,
of
balancing
interests
we
do
feel
that
that
particular
situation
is
a
factor
that
is
important.
and,
this
is
why
we
laid
stress
on
it.
the
court’s
order,
of
course,
was
to
deliver
to
the
court
the
originals
of
all
subpoenaed
items
as
well
as
an
index
analysis
of
those
items,
together
with
taped
copies
of
those
portions
of
the
subpoena
recordings
for
which
transcripts
had
been
released
to
the
public
by
the
president
on
april
30.
now,
this
case
presents
for
review
the
action
of
the
lower
court.
now
may
i,
before
i
get
to
the
jurisdictional
points,
briefly
state
what
we
consider
to
be
a
bird’s
eye
view
of
this
case.
now
invest
in
almost
500
pages
of
briefs,
when
boiled
down,
this
case
really
presents
one
fundamental
issue.
who
is
to
be
the
arbiter
of
what
the
constitution
says?
basically,
this
is
not
a
novel
question,
although
the
factual
situation
involved
is,
of
course,
unprecedented.
there
are
primary
questions
to
be
sure.
but
in
the
end,
after
the
rounds
have
been
made,
we
return
to
face
these
flaring
facts
that
i
want
to
briefly
review
for
the
final
answer.
in
refusing
to
produce
the
evidence
sought
by
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
in
the
criminal
trial
of
seven
defendants,
among
them,
former
chief
of
aids
and
dubieties,
the
president
invokes
the
provisions
of
the
constitution.
his
counsel’s
brief
is
replete
with
references
for
the
constitution
as
justifying
his
position.
and
in
his
public
statement,
as
we
all
know,
the
president
has
embraced
the
constitution
that’s
offering
him
support
for
his
refusal
to
supply
the
subpoenaed
tapes.
now,
the
president
may
be
right
in
how
he
reads
the
constitution.
but,
he
may
also
be
wrong.
and
if
he
is
wrong,
who
is
there
to
tell
him
so?
and
if
there’s
no
one,
then
the
president,
of
course,
is
free
to
pursue
his
course
of
erroneous
interpretations.
what
then
becomes
of
our
constitutional
form
of
government?
so
when
counsel
for
the
president,
in
his
brief,
states
that
this
case
goes
to
the
heart
of
our
basic
constitutional
system,
we
agree
because,
in
our
view,
this
nation’s
constitutional
form
of
government
is
in
serious
jeopardy.
if
the
president,
any
president,
is
to
say
that
the
constitution
means
what
he
says
it
does
and
that
there
is
no
one,
not
even
the
supreme
court,
to
tell
him
otherwise
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes?
mr.
leon
jaworski
he’s
saying
his
position
is
correct
because
he
interprets
the
constitution
that
way.
mr.
leon
jaworski
this
is
what
he
says
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
that’s
not
entirely
correct,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leon
jaworski
while
the
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena
in
sirica
has
also
taken
the
position
that
we
have
no
standing
in
this
court
to
have
this
issue
heard.
mr.
leon
jaworski
so
that,
of
course,
this
court
could
then
not
pass
upon
the
constitutional
question
of
how
he
interprets
the
constitution
if
his
position
were
correct,
but
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
right,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
right.
mr.
leon
jaworski
but
what
i’m
saying
is,
if
he
is
the
sole
judge
and
he
is
to
be
considered
the
sole
judge
and
he
is
in
error
in
his
interpretation,
then
he
goes
on
being
in
error
in
his
interpretation.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
that’s
what
i
think
the
case
is
about.
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
i
can’t
say
that
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
well
mr.
chief
justice,
in
my
view,
frankly,
it
is
a
position
where
he
says
“a
constitution
says
this
and
nobody
is
going
to
tell
me
what
the
constitution
says”
because,
up
to
this
point,
he
says
that
he
and
he
alone
is
the
proper
one
to
interpret
the
constitution.
now,
there’s
now
way
to
escape
that
because
the
briefs
definitely
point
that
out
time
after
time.
mr.
leon
jaworski
it
may
be,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
right,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
alright,
sir.
that
is
a
very
good
beginning
point
but,
of
course,
other
things
have
needed
to
be
discussed
as
much
as
they’ve
been
raised.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that
is
correct,
sir,
and
we
do
point
to
the
authorities
to
show
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
situation
here.
i
do
think
that
it’s
proper,
as
much
as
i
regret
to
have
to
do
it,
to
point
that
the
president’s
interpretation
of
what
his
action
should
be
in
these
particular
set
of
circumstances
as
one
that
really
requires
judicial
intervention,
perhaps
more
so
than
a
normal
one
would.
i
think
that
we
realize
that
there
is
at
steak
the
matter
of
the
supplying
of
evidence
that
relates
to
the
due
form
of
close
aids
and
dubieties.
i
think
we’re
aware
of
the
fact
that
the
president
had
publicly
stated
that
he
believed
that
these
two
aids
of
his,
mr.
haldeman
and
mr.
ehrlichman
would
come
out
alright
in
the
end.
added
to
that,
the
fact
that
the
president
has
a
sensitivity
or
own
involvement
is
also
a
matter
that
calls
for
the
exercise
of
the
question
to
which
mr.
justice
douglas
alluded
as
one
that
is
somewhat
unusual.
turning
now
to
jurisdiction,
before
the
court
are
the
two
questions
of
statutory
jurisdiction.
the
court
directed
the
parties
to
brief
and
argue.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
we
do,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
we
say
it’s
here
not
only
because
of
the
appeal
itself,
but
also
because
of
the
petition
for
mandamus.
now
we
did,
mr.
justice,
discussed
that
in
one
of
the
briefs.
now,
it
may
be
that
it
wasn’t
originally
when
we
filed
the
original
brief
on
jurisdiction.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
we
did
in
the
--
it
was
in
the
footnote
on
page
2
of
the
petitioner
for
writ
of
certiorari,
mr.
justice.
well,
i
would
think
so
but
there
really
is
no
issue
between
the
parties
here
on
the
issue
of
jurisdiction.
i
mean,
there’s
no
argument
as
between
the
parties
on
it.
and,
while
of
course
the
parties
can’t
agree
on
it,
i
must
say
that
on
three
different
bases
the
jurisdiction
does
exist
as
we
see
it.
now,
i
am
not
yet
getting
to
the
question
of
the
intra-executive
matter
that
has
been
raised
but
i
am
discussing
now
the
statutory
basis
of
jurisdiction,
and
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
to
answer
your
question
directly,
sir,
this
is
correct.
we
are
standing
upon
not
only
the
matter
that
this
is
an
appeal
that
properly
had
been
in
the
court
of
appeals
and,
for
that
reason,
has
been
moved
up
here
properly
under
1254-1.
we
also
say
that
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
petition
and
cross-petition
under
1254-1
because
it
present
for
review
all
questions
raised
by
the
president’s
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus.
and
then
we
also
say
that,
in
addition
to
that,
the
all
writs
act
gives
this
court
jurisdiction
to
proceed.
mr.
leon
jaworski
as
far
as
i
know,
he’s
not,
no,
sir.
in
fact,
i’m
sure
he’s
not.
mr.
leon
jaworski
but
it
was
brought
up
by
the
president
in
their
petition
for
mandamus
and
that’s
right.
that’s
the
way
it
got
into
this
court.
it
raises
the
same
questions
actually
that
were
raised
on
the
matter
that
we
brought
upon.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s,
i
believe,
right,
sir
and
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
right,
sir.
yes.
mr.
leon
jaworski
right,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
right,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
mandamus,
correct.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
sir.
they
raise
the
same
questions
but
that’s
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
could
have,
sir,
yes.
mr.
leon
jaworski
but
in
as
much
as
they
present
the
same
questions,
it
occurred
to
us
that
it
was
appropriate
to
rely
upon
the
jurisdiction
as
to
both
of
them.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
it
is
--
i
don’t
have
the
record
before
me
but,
i
must
say
and
i
will
not
make
an
outright
representation
that
judge
sirica
is,
and
that’s
why
i
hesitated
a
few
minutes
ago,
was
made
a
party
after
all
that
was
brought
up
by
the
president.
but,
i
am
advised
by
a
note
just
passed
to
me
by
mr.
lacovara
that
judge
sirica
is
a
party
to
that
proceeding.
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
don’t
know
of
anyone
representing
him
here,
mr.
justice.
mr.
leon
jaworski
so
far
as
i
know,
none.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
it
would
not.
we
were
pointing
out
that
the
jurisdiction
rests
on
a
three-prong
basis.
mr.
leon
jaworski
it’s
not,
no,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct,
sir.
we,
however,
were
pointing
out
that
the
same
issues
really
were
raised
by
it
if
the
petitioner
is
properly
before
the
court.
now,
if
there
are
no
further
questions
on
the
matter
of
statutory
jurisdiction,
i
would
like
to
pass
to
the
intra-executive
dispute.
first,
we
recognize,
of
course,
that
jurisdiction
cannot
be
waived
and
nothing
that
is
presented
here
is
with
the
idea
of
suggesting
even
remotely
that
there
is
any
waiver
with
respect
to
the
questions
of
jurisdiction.
but,
we
do
say
that
the
contention
is
that
there
is
an
intra-executive
dispute
and,
for
that
reason,
this
court
cannot
pass
up
on
these
questions
as
not
sound.
before
discussing
the
case
as,
however,
i
think
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
us
to
undertake
the
bases
in
the
right
perspective.
let
me
say,
first,
that
we
stand
upon
two
bases.
first,
that,
actually,
the
orders
that
were
entered
creating
the
office
of
the
special
prosecutor
and
delineating
his
authority,
even
the
original
order
at
the
time
that
my
predecessor
was
acting
as
special
prosecutor
had
the
force
and
effect
of
law.
we
also
point
to
the
fact
that
the
arrangement
made
itself
with
the
acting
attorney
general
that
i
made,
if
i
may
point
to
it,
and
one
reason
i
have
no
resonance
in
discussing
the
facts
is
because
the
facts
are
undisputed.
there
has
been
no
dispute
raised
as
to
just
what
actually
transpired.
the
situation
is
one
of
the
arrangements
itself
which
the
acting
attorney
general
points
to,
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
independence
having
been
discussed
by
him
with
the
president.
thus,
meaning
that
the
president,
himself,
had
approved
the
setting
up
of
this
particular
office
and
the
rights
and
the
responsibilities
that
it
has
under
the
charter.
now,
let
me
--
we
set
this
out
in
the
appendix,
of
course,
pointing
precisely
to
what
the
authority
and
responsibilities
and
obligations
of
the
special
prosecutor
are.
one
of
the
expressed
duties
that’s
delegated
to
the
special
prosecutor
is
that
he
shall
have
full
authority
for
investigating
and
prosecuting,
among
others,
allegations
involving
the
president.
and
a
delegation
of
authority
expressly
states
in
particular
the
special
prosecutor
shall
have
full
authority
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
contest
the
assertion
of
executive
privilege
or
any
other
testimonial
privilege.
now
in
the
instance
of
my
appointment,
unlike
the
appointment
that
had
been
made
prior
thereto,
there
was
an
amended
order
and
it
referred
to
assurances
given
by
the
president
to
the
attorney
general
that
the
president
will
not
exercise
his
constitutional
powers
to
affect
the
stories
of
the
special
prosecutor
or
to
limit
the
independence
that
he’s
hereby
given,
and
that
he
will
not
be
removed
from
his
duties
except
for
extraordinary
improprieties
on
his
part
and
without
the
president’s
first
consulting
the
majority
and
the
minority
leaders
and
the
chairman
in
ranking
the
minority
members
of
the
judiciary
committees
and
the
senate
and
house
representatives,
and
ascertaining
that
their
consensus
is
in
accord
with
the
proposed
action.
and
then,
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
special
prosecutor
will
not
be
limited
without
the
president’s
first
consulting
with
such
members
of
congress
and
ascertaining
that
their
consensus
is
in
accord
with
his
proposed
action.
now,
at
the
time
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
sir,
it
hadn’t
been
interpreted
by
the
acting
attorney
general
in
conversation
as
meaning
6
of
8.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct,
sir.
i
think
we
have
what
might
be
termed
a
quasi-independent
status
where
they
were
delegated
to
this
particular
office
the
performance
of
certain
functions
and
there’s
no
reason
why
the
president
couldn’t
have
delegated
those
to
us.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes?
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
sir,
for
instance,
as
a
control
of
currency.
he
has
a
state
of
somewhat
similar
to
that.
and,
we
know
that
there
are
suits
brought
between
the
department
of
justice
and
the
controller
just
the
other
day.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
i
didn’t
it.
what
i
meant
was
we
had
an
independent
status
that
was
really
different
from
the
status
of
the
united
states
attorney.
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
thought
that
was
the
way
i
answered
the
question.
now,
i
should
say
that
it’s
interesting
when
the
case
of
nixon
versus
sirica
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
professor
charles
alan
wright,
who
was
then
arguing
the
case
and
who
was
not
on
the
original
brief
but
have
serviced
on
the
reply
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
the
president,
at
that
time
argued
with
respect
to
the
particular
office
of
the
special
prosecutor.
now,
in
this
instance,
we
have
a
division
of
function
within
the
executive
and
that
my
friend
mr.
cox,
referring
to
mr.
archibald
cox,
has
been
given
absolute
independence.
it
is
for
him
to
decide
whom
he
will
seek
to
indict.
it
is
for
him
to
decide
to
whom
he
will
give
immunity,
a
decision
that
ordinarily
would
be
made
at
the
level
of
the
attorney
general
or,
in
an
important
enough
case,
at
the
level
or
the
president.
but
the
president’s
present
counsel
in
his
motion
to
quash,
as
he
does
here
accept
the
words
used
are
different
but
the
effect
is
the
same,
is
contending
to
the
court
that
the
president
has
the
right
to
determine
who,
when,
and
with
what
information
individuals
should
be
prosecuted.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
but
the
independent
--
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
distinction
as
to
the
substantive
right
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct,
sir,
yes.
mr.
leon
jaworski
there
is
that
difference,
yes,
but
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
don’t
think
that
the
description
to
which
i
have
pointed
as
to
the
independent
status
of
the
independent
executor
would
be
different
in
the
sirica
case
as
it
would
be
in
this
case.
and,
i
was
barely
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
sir.
i
realize
that.
now
may
i,
however,
indicate
very
briefly,
and
i
know
this
is
an
important
question
but
i
do
feel
that
the
facts
ought
to
be
before
the
court
in
detail,
indicate
just
what
did
transpire
with
respect
to
how
these
particular
regulations,
this
order,
was
interpreted
by
the
president’s
acting
attorney
general
and
also
by
the
attorney
general
designate
and
also
by
the
president,
himself,
and
by
the
president’s
chief
of
staff,
general
haig.
mr.
bork,
in
hearings
at
a
time
when
congress
was
pressing
the
bill
of
an
independent
special
prosecutor,
testified
that
“although
it
is
anticipated
that
mr.
jaworski
will
receive
cooperation
from
the
white
house
in
getting
any
evidence
he
feels,
he
needs
to
conduct
investigations
from
prosecutions.”
it
is
clear
and
understood
on
all
sides
that
he
has
he
power
to
use
judicial
processes
to
pursue
evidence
if
disagreement
should
develop.
it
was
further
pointed
out
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
acting
attorney
general
bork’s
testimony
in
the
house.
mr.
leon
jaworski
after
i
have
been
appointed
and
in
connection
with
the
hearings
on
the
bill
to
establish
an
independent
prosecutor
by
congressional
act.
mr.
leon
jaworski
then,
he
further
said,
i
understand
and
it
is
clear
to
me,
that
“mr.
jaworski
can
go
to
court
and
test
out,”
and
these
are
the
important
words,
“and
test
out
any
refusal
to
produce
documents
on
the
grounds
of
confidentiality.”
and
attorney
general
saxbe,
then
a
designate
who
was
also
present
at
the
time
that
this
matter
was
discussed
and
at
the
time
that
i
accepted
the
responsibilities,
testified
that
i
had
the
right
to
contest
an
assertion
of
executive
privilege
and
stated
that
i
can
go
to
court
at
any
time
to
determine
that.
now
the
president
himself,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
in
announcing
the
appointment
of
a
new
independent
prosecutor,
stated
to
the
nation
that
he
had
no
greater
interest
than
to
see
that
the
new
special
prosecutor
has
the
cooperation
from
the
executive
branch
and
the
independence
that
he
needs
to
bring
about
that
conclusion
of
the
watergate
investigation.
the
president’s
chief
of
staff,
at
the
time
that
this
appointment
was
accepted
and
at
the
time
that
the
new
regulations
were
then
drafted
by
the
acting
attorney
general,
had
assured
me,
and
this
is
a
part
of
the
record,
because
a
letter
was
written
at
the
request
of
senator
hugh
scott
to
the
white
house
as
a
result
of
discussions
that
he
had
with
general
haig
in
which
i
sent
a
copy
of
the
testimony
that
i
had
given
to
the
congressional
committees,
to
the
white
house
so
it
would
fully
be
aware
of
it
and
the
receipt
of
it
was
acknowledged
without
any
change
in
the
testimony.
so,
i
had
been
assured
of
the
right
to
judicial
process
and
by
him
after
he
had
reviewed
the
matter
with
the
president
and
he
came
and
told
me
that
i
would
have
the
right
to
take
the
president
to
court,
and
that
these
were
the
key
words
in
this
arrangement,
and
that
the
right
would
not
be
questioned.
of
course,
this
independence
was
given
to
the
special
prosecutor.
actually,
it
was
but
an
echo
of
public
demand.
and,
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
so,
it
was
the
only
basis
on
which,
after
what
had
occurred
and
a
predecessor
had
been
discharged,
it
was
on
a
basis
on
which
that
special
prosecutor
could
have
felt
that
he
could
come
and
serve
and
undertake
to
perform
these
functions.
it’s
important,
i
think,
to
observe
that
the
counsel
for
the
president
in
his
brief,
by
accepting
the
proposition
that
the
president
and
the
attorney
general
can
delegate
certain
executive
functions
to
subordinate
officers,
implicitly
has
conceded,
so
we
think,
the
validity
of
the
regulations
delegating
prosecutorial
powers
to
the
special
prosecutor.
the
regulations
specifically
provide,
as
you
will
notice
from
the
appendix
and
we
have
set
them
out,
that
the
attorney
general
will
not
counterman
or
interfere
with
the
special
prosecutor’s
decisions
or
actions.
this
is
also
a
part
of
the
charter.
just
to
argue
as
has
been
done
in
these
briefs,
that
the
separation
of
powers
precludes
the
courts
from
entertaining
this
action
because
it
is
the
exclusive
prerogative
of
the
executive
branch,
not
the
judiciary,
to
determine
whom
to
prosecute,
on
what
charges,
and
with
what
evidence,
we
think,
misses
the
point.
what
has
evolved
from
the
regulations,
in
our
view,
is
a
prosecutorial
force
with
certain
exclusive
responsibilities.
and
this
is
why
i
say
that
to
some
degree
it
could
be
described
as
a
quasi-independent
agency.
it’s
not
unlike
our
situation
as
the
case
we
alluded
to
a
few
minutes
ago,
decided
by
the
court
just
a
week
or
so
ago.
it’s
not
unlike
the
case
of
the
secretary
of
agriculture
versus
the
united
states.
this
is
the
first
time
that
there
has
been
an
action
brought
by
one
member
of
the
executive
branch
against
another
official
in
the
executive
branch.
and,
we
refer
to
these
cases
in
our
briefs
in
detail.
now,
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
the
president,
at
no
point
of
course,
delegated
to
the
special
prosecutor
the
exclusive
right
to
pass
on
the
question
of
executive
privilege
or
any
other
privilege,
attorney-inclined
privilege,
or
any
other
testimonial
privilege.
what
we
are
merely
saying
is
that
we
have
the
clear
right
to
test
it
in
this
court,
and
this
is
on
what
we
stand.
well
because
of
the
passage
of
time,
if
i
may,
i
think
i
should
get
to
other
discussions
unless
there
are
questions
on
this
particular
point.
passing
to
the
merits,
we
would
say
that
if
there
is
any
one
principle
of
law
that
marbury
versus
madison
cites,
it
is
that
it
is
up
to
the
court
to
say
what
the
law
is
and
almost
to
the
point
of
redundancy
but
necessary
because
it
was
a
landmark
decision.
chief
justice
marshall
reasoned,
we
think,
with
clarity
and
emphasis
that
it
is
emphatically
the
province
and
the
duty
of
the
judicial
department
to
say
what
the
law
is.
and
this
court
of
course,
through
the
years,
has
reaffirmed
consistently
applied
that
rule.
it’s
done
it
in
a
number
of
cases,
in
powell
versus
mccormack,
in
the
youngstown
steel
seizure
case,
and
doe
versus
mcmillan.
and
a
footnote,
i
think
a
very
important
one,
appears
in
that
opinion
when
mr.
justice
white
pointed
out
that
while
an
inquiry
such
as
involved
in
a
present
case,
because
it
involves
two
coordinate
branches
of
government,
must
necessarily
have
separation
of
power
implications.
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine
has
not
previously
prevented
this
court
from
reviewing
the
acts
of
congress
even
when,
it
is
pointed
out,
the
executive
branch
is
also
involved.
now,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
speak
to
that.
i
think
one
of
the
cases
that
went
into
greater
detail
and
also
points
out
quite
a
distinguishing
feature
is
the
gravel
case
where
as,
in
the
gravel
case,
the
court
did
hold
that
it
was
appropriate
to
go
into
certain
matters
where
a
privilege
had
been
exercised
on
a
part
of
a
senator
on
behalf
of
his
aid.
there
are
two
things
that
i
believe
clearly
help
us
in
that
decision
and
also
other
decisions
as
far
as
the
questions
here
are
involved.
one
is
that
the
speech
or
debate
clause
is
in
the
constitution,
as
is
the
journal
clause.
it’s
in
the
constitution.
it’s
written
in
there.
and,
this
is
what
was
invoked.
i
don’t
find
anything
written
in
the
constitution
and
nothing
has
been
pointed
that
is
a
writing
in
the
constitution
that
relates
to
the
right
of
the
exercise
of
executive
privilege
on
the
part
of
the
president.
another
very
important
thing
that’s
pointed
out
in
that
case
is
that
it
did
involve
an
examination
into
wrongdoing
on
that
part
of
those
who
were
seeking
to
invoke
the
privilege.
mr.
leon
jaworski
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
leon
jaworski
it
has
been
used
over
a
period
of
time.
how
ancient,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i’m
not
in
position
to
say.
but,
certainly,
it
has
been
one
that’s
been
used
over
the
years
but
it
is
not
one
that
i
find
it
a
basis
for
in
the
constitution.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
no,
sir,
but
i
said
it
had
no
basis
for
it
in
the
constitutions
but
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
sir,
and
that
it
has
been
judicially
recognized,
and
appropriately
so,
in
a
number
of
cases.
as
we
see
it,
we
do
not
think
that
it
is
an
appropriate
one
in
this
case
but
we
certainly
do
not,
for
a
moment,
feel
that
it
has
any
constitutional
face.
mr.
leon
jaworski
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
exactly
the
point.
this
court
has
examined
a
number
of
situations
and
in
some
situations
as,
i
think,
was
pointed
out
earlier
where
military
secrets
and
such
as
that
were
involved
or
national
secrets
of
great
importance,
the
court
has
taken
a
good
close
look
and
has
upheld
privilege.
but
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
what
i
mean.
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
it
said
that
it
had
constitutional
overtones
and
i
don’t
know
it
may
have
been
used
but
it
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
but
it
certainly
has
never
placed
it
in
the
constitution,
so
far
as
i’m
aware
of,
and
president’s
counsel
who
have
carefully
examined
the
authorities.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes.
mr.
leon
jaworski
yes,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that
the
privilege,
as
recognized
judicially,
may
have
been
tied
into
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine,
we
don’t
deny.
what
we
say
is
that
separation
of
powers
doctrine,
in
the
exercise
and
the
calling
for
executive
privilege,
has
not
been
applied.
in
a
number
of
instances
involving
both
congress
and
involving
also
the
executive,
despite
the
fact
that
even
in
congressional
situations,
speech
and
debate
clause
is
there.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
separation
of
powers
doctrine,
as
was
pointed
to
in
the
doe
versus
mcmillan
case,
has
not
been
permitted
to
stand
in
the
way
of
this
court
examining
it
in
the
standpoint
of
whether
the
executive
privilege
should
be
permitted
or
not.
this
is
what
i’m
saying.
mr.
leon
jaworski
the
issue
of
executive
privilege,
i
should
point
out
here,
is
a
very
narrow
one.
and,
i
think
it’s
important
that
we
bear
this
in
mind.
it
doesn’t
involve
a
very
large
or
broad
privilege
rights.
what
it
really
narrows
down
to
is
somewhat
simple
but
very
important
issue
in
the
administrative
of
criminal
justice
and
that
is
whether
the
president,
in
a
pending
prosecution,
can
withhold
material
evidence
from
the
court
merely
on
his
assertion
that
the
evidence
involves
confidential
communications
and
this
is
what
really
it
gets
down
to.
we
know
that
sovereign
prerogatives
to
protect
the
confidentiality
necessary
to
carryout
responsibilities
in
the
fields
of
international
relations
and
national
defense
are
not,
here,
involved.
and,
there
is
no
claim
of
any
state
secrets
or
that
disclosure
will
have
dire
effect
on
a
nation
or
its
people.
actually,
i
think
when
we
get
to
wayne
and
the
non-disclosure
as
against
disclosure
and
i
think
when
we
begin
to
lay
the
balance
of
interest,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
balance
clearly
lies
in
favor
of
a
disclosure
in
a
situation
such
as
the
circumstance
here.
of
course
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
not
present,
mr.
justice
douglas,
and
there
is
no
question
about
what
the
fifth
amendment
has
very
plainly
written
out
in
the
constitution
and
is
invoked
as
a
clear
constitutional
privilege.
i
think
it
would
be
of
help
if
i
may
point
out
to
the
court,
that
there
is
an
excellent
article
that
we
have
alluded
to
in
our
briefs
by
professor
berger
that
appears
in
a
yale
law
journal
which
discusses
the
ehrenberg
case
at
length
and
also
other
cases
that
have
been
pointed
to
since
the
time
of
that
case.
and,
if
i
may
just
say
very
briefly,
that
summarizes
the
situation
by
saying
that
the
heart
of
marshall’s
opinion
was,
therefore,
just
as
summarized
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
nixon
v.
sirica
case
and
the
tapes
case
that
we
have
talked
about.
the
court
was
to
show
respect
for
the
president’s
reason,
but
the
ultimate
decision
remained
with
the
court.
and
we
are
not
suggesting,
for
a
moment,
here
that
the
matter
of
executive
privilege
should
not
be
looked
into.
this
is
not
--
it
deserves
to
be
tested.
it
should
be
tested
and
we
urge
that
it
be
tested.
but,
the
ultimate
decision
is
not
one
of
saying
that
it
is
absolute
that
it
rests
on
the
constitution
that
it
doesn’t
entitle
anyone
and
doesn’t
authorize
anyone.
it
doesn’t
even
authorize
this
court
to
look
into
it,
because
if
the
courts
are
the
ultimate
interpreters
of
the
constitution
and
can
restrain
congress
to
operate
within
the
constitutional
balance,
they
certainly
shouldn’t
be
empowered
and
lest
to
measure
presidential
claims
of
constitutional
powers.
i
wanted
briefly
to
make
mention
of
the
questions
that
has
been
raised
by
counsel
for
the
president
that
involves
a
motion
to
expunge
the
finding
of
the
grand
jury’s
action
that
the
president
is
to
be
named
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator
along
with
a
number
of
others
when
the
pretrial
proceedings
are
going
into,
and
a
bill
of
particulars
is
being
filed.
and
i
say
that
the
grand
jury’s
finding,
painful
as
it
is
i
think,
on
the
part
of
the
court,
must
be
considered
as
being
valid
and
sufficient
to
show
a
prima
facie.
it
is
sufficient
to
show
a
prima
facie
that
the
president
was
involved
in
the
proceedings
in
the
course
and
the
continuation
of
the
particular
conspiracy
that
was
charged.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
also
another
issue.
but
i
merely
wanted
to
point
out
that
i
believe
that
this
court
would
not
go
into
the
grand
jury’s
findings,
but
it’s
a
prima
facie
matter
and
that
this
court
would
not
go
into
it
for
the
purpose
of
determining
a
matter
of
that
kind.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
i
have
to
agree
with
you,
neither
do
i
see
what
the
relevance
is
of
the
matter
of
saying
that
there’s
another
argument
advanced
here
and
that
is
that
the
president
can’t
be
indicted.
and,
i
don’t
know
what
the
relevance
of
that
is
in
this
case
either,
very
frankly,
because
it
isn’t
before
the
court.
and,
yet,
the
argument
is
made
and
many
pages
of
briefs
are
devoted
to
it.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
this
is
why
i
skipped
the
argument
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
whether
he
could
be
indicted
or
not.
but
as
much
as
the
question
had
been
raised
and
briefed
and
a
motion
exist
before
the
court,
i
have
to
agree
that
it
is
irrelevant
but
it
is
a
part
of
the
case,
and
that’s
the
only
reason
i
alluded
to
it
and
i
have
no
interesting
in
spending
much
time
on
it.
mr.
leon
jaworski
right.
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
matter
that,
very
frankly,
has
any
particular
basis
to
it
because
i
don’t
see
how
this
court
could
be
asked
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
right.
mr.
leon
jaworski
not
only
that,
i
think
that
it
has,
to
pinpoint
it
in
our
view,
a
materiality
because
it
does
relate
to
the
question
of
the
proof
that
we
are
seeking
the
relevance
of
the
proof
that
we
are
seeking.
and
this
gets
into,
of
course,
a
discussion
of
matters
that
are
sealed
and
which
i
cannot
discuss
with
the
court.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s,
i
think,
correct.
now
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
that
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
that
is
very
much
--
mr.
leon
jaworski
well,
certainly,
it’s
in
the
case
now
and,
of
course,
which
you
have
reference
too
also,
i’m
sure,
mr.
justice
douglas,
as
the
bray
and
the
jinks,
maryland
versus
bray
and
the
jinks.
and,
this
is
a
part
of
the
case.
however,
it
happens
not
to
be
a
part
of
the
appeal,
although
it
is
a
part
of
the
case.
but
as
far
as
our
position
is
concerned,
it
doesn’t
relate
to
that.
but,
certainly,
it’s
true
that
this
material,
as
we
had
pointed
out
in
our
communications
to
the
president,
may
well
involve
exculpatory
matters
and
we,
time
and
again,
pointed
out
we
wanted
them
not
simply
because
we
felt
that
there
were
matters
that
needed
to
be
developed
in
connection
with
the
prosecution,
but
that
they
could
well
contain
exculpatory
matters.
mr.
leon
jaworski
would
be
available.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
that’s
correct,
sir.
mr.
leon
jaworski
it’s
not
before
this
court.
i
believe,
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i’ll
reserve
the
rest
of
the
time
for
the
close.
