mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
advert
first
to
procedural
questions
that
mr.
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
stewart
have
raised
about
whether
the
mandamus
case
is
properly
here.
mr.
justice,
we
did,
in
our
certiorari
petition,
refer
to
the
fact
that
we
were
trying
to
bring
before
the
court
for
review
before
judgment
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
order
of
the
district
court
which
we
said
the
president
had
tried
to
obtain
review
of
in
two
ways
in
two
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
gave
the
docket
numbers
of
those
two
cases.
and,
that
certiorari
petition
was
filed
on
may
24
and
judge
sirica,
who
was
the
respondent
as
justice
stewart
properly
notes
in
the
mandamus
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
was
served
with
a
copy
of
the
certiorari
petition
as
he
had
been
served
with
the
mandamus
petition
as,
indeed,
had
all
the
respondents
who
were
otherwise
before
the
court,
the
defendants
in
united
states
against
mitchell.
on
may
28
in
accordance
with
a
motion
that
was
filed
in
a
court
of
appeals,
a
copy
of
which
i
believe
is
in
the
files
of
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
transmitted
to
this
court
the
records
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
appeal
and
the
mandamus
cases.
now,
mr.
justice
stewart,
with
respect
to
judge
sirica’s
appearance
here,
he
is
a
party
before
this
court
and
i
believe
there
is
a
letter
on
file
with
the
clerk
of
this
court
from
judge
sirica
in
which
he
states
that
he
will
not
appear
separately
the
united
states
through
the
special
prosecutors
appearing
on
behalf
of
judge
sirica
as,
indeed,
we
would
have
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
uphold
his
decision
enforcing
our
subpoena.
so
the
case,
procedurally,
is
properly
before
the
court
both
with
respect
to
the
appeal
and
the
mandamus
proceedings.
i’d
like
to—
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well
i
think,
normally,
you
might
start
with
17c
end
because
that
would
provide
for
a
conceivably
for
disposition
on
non-constitutional
grounds
if
you
found
that
we
had
not
made
a
sufficient
showing
to
satisfy
the
ordinary
requirements
of
the
rule.
so,
in
accordance
with
court’s
normal
jurisprudence
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
absolutely,
he
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
have
made
the
suggestion
that
any
appellant
court
reviewing
this
kind
of
determination
applies
the
standard
of
whether
the
district
judge
was
intimately
familiar
with
this
indictment
and
with
the
49-page
appendix
showing
that
we
submitted
in
demonstrating
why
each
of
these
64
subpoenaed
conversations
was
material.
he
made
the
finding
that
we
had
clearly
demonstrated
relevance
and
an
evidentiary
nature
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
and
your
standard
review
should
be
whether
he
has
abused
his
discretion.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
clearly
erroneous
standard,
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i’m
sorry,
which
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
parties
are
in
agreement
that
bowman
dairy
and
iozia
that
district
court
decision
established
the
basic
criteria
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
we
have
suggested
that
it’s
possible
that
a
lower
standard
can
be
applied.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
my
position
would
be
that
when
you’re
talking
about
a
subpoena
to
a
third
party,
as
distinguished
from
an
intra-case
subpoena
between
government
and
defendant,
a
lower
standard
or
relevancy
or
materiality
should
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
we
have
suggested
that
even
if
the
proper
standard
is
applied,
that
we
meet
that
standard
because
of
the
showing
that
we
made
that
each
of
these
items
is
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
necessity
in
a
sense
of
being
relevant
to
the
issues
to
be
tried
and
being
of
an
evidentiary
nature.
now,
the
necessity
standard
comes
in
more
in
determining
whether
the
executive
privilege
claim
should
be
overwritten
if,
apart
from
the
waiver
fact
and
what
we
call
the
clot
point
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that,
obviously,
we
don’t
think
is
a
proper
legal
standard
and
the
courts
have
said.
in
fact,
we
go
back
to
chief
justice
marshall’s
opinion
in
the
burr
case
where
exactly
the
same
suggestion
was
made
by
the
united
states
attorney
in
opposing
the
subpoena,
that
burr
hasn’t
specified
which
portions
of
general
wilkinson’s
letter
were
really
going
to
be
material.
and
chief
justice
marshall
applied
with
his
eloquent
common
sense,
of
course
not,
because
he
hasn’t
seen
the
letter
yet
but
he’s
made
a
sufficient
averment
that
it
does
contain
something
material,
that
at
least
it
should
be
brought
into
court.
now
we
have,
as
i
say,
gone
much
further
than
colonel
burr
did.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
when
you’re
talking
about
a
subpoena
between
the
parties,
yes,
sir.
they
talked
about
other
criteria,
which
i
think
are
really
subsumed
whether
it’s
a
fishing
expedition,
whether
you’re
going
off
on
a
frolic.
but
as
the
later
cases,
as
i
believe
judge
sirica
indicates,
seem
to
have
distilled
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
it’d
be
critical?
no,
sir,
i
don’t
believe
so.
i
think
that,
as
you
were
suggesting
before
and
as
judge
sirica
held,
it’s
never
been
the
law
that
once
an
indictment
is
returned
the
prosecution
is
not
entitled
to
continue
gathering
evidence.
the
burdens
of
proof
before
a
grand
jury
and
a
trial
jury
are
clearly
different.
it’s
an
abuse
of
the
grand
jury
process
that
has
been
held
to
use
a
grand
jury
subpoena,
as
mr.
st.
clair
suggested,
to
continue
gathering
evidence
after
an
indictment
is
returned.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
i
hope
i’m
not
conceding
more
than
i
should.
but,
the
rule
does
talk
about
subpoenaing
material
from
a
person
on
a
showing
that
it
will
be
relevant.
it’s
rule
17
and
i’m
talking
a
position
which
is
narrower
than,
of
course,
you’re
suggesting,
mr.
justice,
that
i
might
take.
but,
in
all
candor,
the
rule
talks
about
subpoenaing
documents
from
a
person
not
only
from
a
party.
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
believe
you
earlier
mentioned
that
the
rule
applied
only
to
subpoenas
to
parties,
but
the
rule
specifically
provides
for
subpoenas
to
persons
who
are
not
parties
to
the
case.
but
it
says,
and
this
was
the
clause
that
we
were
relying
on
here,
the
court
may
direct
that
the
books
or
papers
be
produced
before
the
court
at
a
time
prior
to
the
trial
or
prior
to
the
time
when
they
are
to
be
offered
in
evidence.
so,
there
does
seem
to
be
some
natural
focus
about
the
evidentiary
nature
of
the
materials.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
sir.
we
insist,
as
judge
sirica
found,
that
with
citation
of
chapter
and
verse,
if
i
may,
in
our
49-page
showing
before
the
district
court
with
references
to
sworn
testimony
as
well
as
with
representations
about
what
witnesses
will
testify
trial
we
demonstrated
why
each
of
these
subpoenaed
conversations
satisfies
the
bowman
dairy
v.
iozia
rule
17c
standard.
now,
that
leads
me
into
the
related
point.
what
is
the
relevance
of
the
grand
jury’s
finding
that
the
president
was
a
co-conspirator
in
this
case?
it
has
been
alleged
that
we
did
this
in
order
to
prejudice
the
president’s
rights.
i
think
we
have
sought
to
demonstrate
in
our
reply
brief
that
that
was
in
no
sense
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
normally,
i
will
concede,
it
is
not
the
practice,
as
anyone
who’s
been
a
prosecutor
knows,
for
the
grand
jury
if
it
is
not
identifying
the
co-conspirators
in
the
body
of
its
indictment
to
place
them
on
the
record.
it
is
fairly
common
practice,
however,
for
an
indictment
to
say
in
addition
to
the
defendants
named
persons
or
unindicted
co-conspirators.
this
is
not
an
ordinary
case
and
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
that
was
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
get
to
in
discussing
what
we
call
our
clot
argument.
we
have
never
argued,
and
of
course
there
would
be
no
basis
for
arguing
that
the
mere
grand
jury
finding,
whether
on
the
face
of
the
indictment
or
in
the
grand
jury’s
minutes,
that
the
president
or
any
of
the
other
18
unindicted
co-conspirators
were
members
of
this
conspiracy
would,
itself,
be
enough
at
trial
to
want
judge’s
admission
of
extra
judicial
statements
given
by
those
co-conspirators.
we
are
not
making
that
contention
here.
the
issue
arises
because
a
motion
to
quash
a
subpoena
was
filed
prior
to
trial.
and,
the
basis
for
that
motion
was
a
claim
of
executive
privilege,
a
governmental
privilege
that
exists
fro
the
benefit
of
legitimate
governmental
processes.
we
countered
that
apart
from
nixon
versus
sirica
and
the
balancing
process,
and
apart
from
the
waiver
argument
that
we
also
develop
in
some
length,
this
president,
as
difficult
as
it
was
to
say
this
not
because
of
the
evidence
but
because
of
the
inherent
awkwardness
of
it,
this
president
is
not
in
a
position
to
claim
this
public
privilege
for
the
reason
that
a
prima
facie
showing
can
be
made
that
these
conversations
were
not
in
pursuance
of
legitimate
governmental
processes
or
the
lawful
deliberation
of
the
public’s
business.
these
conversations,
as
we
showed
in
our
49-page
appendix
and
as
the
grand
jury
alleged,
were
in
furtherance
of
the
criminal
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
and
obstruct
justice.
we
did
not
rely
even
before
judge
sirica
and
we
do
not
rely
here
merely
on
the
fact
that
the
grand
jury
made
this
determination.
we
do
submit
that,
for
purposes
of
a
pretrial
consideration
of
a
subpoena
that
is
challenged
on
grounds
of
executive
privilege,
we
are
not
confronted
with
the
need
that
we
will
be
confronted
with
a
trial
in
which
we
fully
intend
to
discharge
of
showing
by
evidence
to
the
trial
judge
that
the
president
and
the
other
co-conspirators
were
members
of
the
co-conspirators.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
sir,
and
we
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
no,
absolutely
not
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i’m
sorry.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
let
me
back
up
a
little.
i
see
the
point
that
you’re
making.
we
are
taking
the
position
that
the
grand
jury’s
determination
is
conclusive
on
the
court
on
two
issues:
(a)
that
a
conspiracy
existed,
and
(b)
that
president
nixon
was
a
member
of
the
conspiracy.
that
is
not
enough,
we
concede,
to
override
a
claim
of
executive
privilege
because,
as
mr.
st.
clair
well
says,
he
is
still
the
president
and
he
still
is
in
the
position
to
invoke
executive
privilege.
where
we
had
said
we
must
bear
an
evidentiary
burden
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
is
on
drawing
the
nexus
between
the
subpoenaed
conversations
and
the
conclusively
determined
prima
facie
showing
that
there
is
a
conspiracy
in
which
the
president
is
a
member.
we
made
that
evidentiary
showing
to
judge
sirica.
that
showing
is
before
this
court.
judge
sirica
found
that
showing
was
sufficient
and
for
that
reason,
as
i
believe
his
opinion
although
it
had
to
be
guarded
because
these
items
were
placed
under
seal,
reflects
that
he
did
make
the
showing.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
sir.
it
could
have
been
made
as
an
evidentiary
matter,
but
we
are
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
pardon
me?
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
sir.
the
evidence
that
was
placed
before
judge
sirica,
we
would
submit,
would
be
sufficient
to
make
that
showing.
now,
we
have
said
that
that
is
not
legally
necessary.
that
we
did
not
have
to
make,
didn’t
have
to
prove
a
conspiracy,
in
effect,
prove
the
whole
case
that
may
take
three
months
to
try
in
order
to
defeat
a
claim
of
executive
privilege
before
trial.
this
court
has
frequently
said
that
criminal
process
would
be
burdened
down
unduly
if
proceedings
were
preceded
by
many
proceedings.
that’s
exactly
what
we
have
here.
we
submit
the
evidence
is
sufficient.
judge
sirica,
the
evidence,
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
showing
that
we
did
submit
intrinsically,
we
submit,
tracks
the
allegations
of
the
indictment
and
provides
independent
evidentiary
support
for
those
allegations.
we
have
said,
though,
that
it
is
not
legally
necessary
in
a
proceeding
like
this
for
the
court
independently
to
decide
whether
the
grand
jury
had
enough
evidence
before
it
to
say
there
is
a
conspiracy
or
that
a
particular
individual
was
a
member
of
the
conspiracy.
we
said
all
you
need
to
find
is
that
we
have
shown
that
these
conversations
were
in
furtherance
of
that
conspiracy.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
have
not
expressed
a
position
on
that,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
we
argue
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
do,
in
fact,
make
that
argument
at
some
length.
i
guess
all
of
our
arguments
are
made
with
too
much
length,
but
we
do
argue
at
length,
sir,
seriously
that
the
question
of
presidential
indictability
which
we
offer
some
views
on
just
to
show
that
het
question
is
an
open
one
because
of
our
obligation,
we
believe
to
the
law
and
to
the
court,
is
not
really
determinative
of
the
question
that
is
really
in
this
case
to
the
extent
that
the
court
reaches
the
expungement
argument
advanced
by
counsel
or
to
the
extent
that
the
court
does
not
reach
the
so-called
clark
argument
that
executive
privilege
just
cannot
be
invoked
here.
the
issue
of
presidential
indictability
does
not
determine
the
issue
whether
an
incumbent
president
can
be
named
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator
by
a
grand
jury.
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
why
even
persons
who
do
have
some
constitutional
immunity,
and
counsel
argues
that,
implicitly
under
the
framework
of
the
constitution
the
president
should
have
an
implicit
immunity
from
prosecution
even
such
persons
can
be
and
frequently
are
named
by
grand
jury
as
unindicted
co-conspirators.
the
practical
arguments
that
may
militate
in
favor
of
a
judicial
recognition
of
some
unique
immunity
for
the
president
alone,
not
for
circuit
judges,
not
for
supreme
court
justices,
not
for
members
of
congress
but
the
president
alone,
it
may
be
held
at
some
later
date,
is
immune
from
prosecution
but,
by
no
means,
suggest
the
answer
to
the
question
here.
and,
the
grand
jury
elected
not
to
test
that
issue.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
it
is,
mr.
justice,
and
there’s
no
doubt
about
it.
we
are
conscious
of
the
delicacy
of
the
issue.
we
have
suggested,
however,
that
although
there
is
some
conceivable
opportunity
for
abuse
our
judicial
system,
our
democratic
system,
is
based
on
a
several
fundamental
propositions.
one
of
which
is
that
grand
juries
usually
are
not
malicious.
even
prosecutors
cannot
be
assumed
to
be
malicious.
we
also
assume,
as
this
court
regularly
holds
in
first
amendment
cases
dealing
with
public
officials,
that
we
have
a
resilient
society
where
people
can
be
trusted
to
sort
out
truth
from
falsity.
we
have
a
robust
debate.
i
submit
to
you,
sir,
that
just
as
in
this
case
a
grand
jury
would
not
likely
accuse
the
president
of
a
crime.
so,
to
that
fear
that
perhaps
without
basis
some
grand
jury
somewhere
might
maliciously
accuse
a
president
of
a
crime
is
not
necessarily
a
compelling
reason
for
saying
that
a
grand
jury
has
no
power
to
do
that.
i
think
the
system
may
be
vibrant
enough
to
deal
with
that
and
i
think
the
inherent
dignity
of
the
presidential
office
and
any
incumbent
providing
him
with
a
notable
check
against
being
defeated
or,
as
my
colleague
says,
impeached
by
the
action
of
a
grand
jury.
this
is
perhaps
the
most
notorious
event
and
notorious
case
in
recent
times.
when
the
grand
jury’s
action
was
disclosed,
i
venture
to
say
that
although
it
was
difficult
time
for
all
concerned,
including
prosecutors
as
well
as
other
counsel
and
the
president
and
the
country.
the
president
has
not
been
displaced
from
office.
he
still
is
president.
he
still
functions
in
accordance
with
his
constitutional
powers.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
64,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
to
foreclose
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
answer
to
my
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
yes
because
these
are
the
procedures
that
have
been
set
up
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
of
nixon
versus
sirica
which
were
found
to
be
eminently
practical
when
the
tapes
subpoenaed
by
the
grand
jury
were
submitted.
these
are
six-hour
reels
and,
under
the
so-called
index
and
analysis
which
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
required
to
be
submitted
and
which
judge
sirica
here
has
required
to
be
submitted,
counsel
for
the
president
says
this
is
a
six-hour
reel.
the
watergate-related
portions
are
minutes
312
--
no,
that’s
too
many
--
112
through
146.
prior
to
that,
there
is
a
meeting
between
the
presidnet
and
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
on
a
school
bill.
after
the
watergate-related
discussions,
there
is
a
meeting
between
the
president
and
representatives
of
the
national
association
of
manufacturers.
what
has
happened
is
that
white
house
counsel
has
come
to
the
judge’s
chambers
with
the
original
reels.
they
have
marked
the
beginning
of
the
watergate-related
portions
on
those
reels
for
the
court
to
make
his
independent
determination.
this
is
watergate-related
and,
therefore,
offset
by
whatever
overcoming
of
the
privilege
has
been
held.
and
after
that
is
done,
a
copy
of
the
watergate-related
portions
is
made.
the
judge
does
not
listen
to
the
non-watergate-related
portions
which
are
still
covered
by
a
presumptive
executive
privilege
which
we
have
freely
conceded
from
the
time
the
grand
jury
began
this
process
in
july
of
’73
to
our
briefs
in
this
court.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that’s
correct,
sir,
and
i
might
say
that
under
the
procedure
that
was
worked
out,
this
may
pre-date
mr.
st.
clair
so
you’ll
have
to
rely
solely
on
my
representation,
president
indicated
a
willingness
to
allow
the
judge
to
listen
to
a
few
moments
of
conversation
on
either
end
of
the
portion
of
the
tape
that
had
been
listed
in
this
index
and
analysis
as
being
watergate-related
just
so
he
would
have
an
assurance
that
there
was
a
transition
from
one
subject
to
another
subject.
that
was
created
by
the
president
as
being
--
if
a
minimal
intrusion
on
the
confidentiality
privilege
for
an
unrelated
subject
certainly,
by
no
means,
an
excessive
one.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
was
to
be
my
last
point,
sir,
and
i
will
make
it
right
now.
the
notion
that
because
there
is
concurrently
underway
an
impeachment
inquiry
before
the
house
of
representatives
that,
somehow,
makes
this
a
non-justiciable
political
question.
it
is,
we
think,
a
remarkable
notion
which
is
not
supported
by
sound
and
constitutional
law
or
by
any
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
and
indeed,
i
submit,
that
to
the
extent
that
the
court
has
discretion
in
the
matter
and
although
this
court
has
now
been
given
discretionary
certiorari
power,
district
courts
have
no
such
option.
it
would
not
even
be
a
wise
exercise
of
discretion
for
this
court
to
stay
its
hand.
this
case
before
the
court
is
not
a
request
for
an
opinion
between
two
congressional
committees
as
to
who
has
jurisdiction
over
a
particular
bill.
it’s
not
even
a
request
for
a
dispute
between
cabinet
officers
or
the
president
and
a
cabinet
officer
over
what
proper
executive
policy
ought
to
be.
this
is
a
criminal
proceeding
of
federal
criminal
case
against
six
defendants.
a
subpoena
had
been
issued
to
obtain
evidence
for
use
at
the
trial
which
is
scheduled
to
begin
on
september
9.
the
court
cannot
escape
the
fact
that
this
is
a
trial
of
tremendous
national
importance,
but
a
trial
that
was
brought
to
ahead
without
regard
to
the
impeachment
inquiry.
this
is
an
independent
separate
constitutional
process
that
is
underway,
and
a
traditional
prosaic
remedy.
a
subpoena
has
been
utilized
to
obtain
evidence
for
that
trial.
there’s
some
debate
about
whether
the
evidence
is
critical
to
our
prosecution.
i
know
that
in
justice
rehnquist’s
opinion
a
few
weeks
ago
in
michigan
against
tucker
that
he
echoed
or
presaged
perhaps
the
same
point
that
judge
sirica
made
that
it’s
really
the
obligation
of
the
prosecution
to
present
all
of
the
material
evidence
for
the
jury,
for
the
fact-finder
to
pass
upon.
that’s
what
this
case
involves.
now
to
say
that
there
will
be
public
consequences,
even
political
consequences,
to
the
court’s
action
does
not
mean
this
is
a
political
question
so
that
the
court
must
regard
it
as
non-justiciable.
the
same
argument
would
have
prevented
this
court
from
deciding
marbury
and
madison.
it’s
common
knowledge
that
chief
justice
marshall,
himself,
was
threatened
with
impeachment
if
he
decided
the
case
against
president
jefferson.
he
went
ahead
and
did
his
duty
on
behalf
of
this
court.
later,
in
connection
with
the
burr
trial
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
he
says
that,
expressly
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
if
you
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
case
is
normally
thought
of
as
being
solely
concerned
with
original
jurisdiction.
but
if
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
if
one
reads
the
case
again,
sir,
i
submit,
chief
justice
marshall
got
to
the
original
jurisdiction
point
only
after
he
had
been
very
decisive
in
saying
that
a
lower
court
could
issue
and
should
issue
and
would
be
obliged
to
issue
the
mandamus
to
secretary
madison
because
the
president
had
not
legal
power
to
order
secretary
of
state
madison
not
to
issue
that
commission.
he
held
that.
it
might
be
called
dictum
but
it
certainly,
at
the
time,
was
a
courageous
act.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
concede
that,
sir.
later,
however,
when
he
did
go
on
in
1807
to
issue
the
subpoena
to
president
jefferson,
that
was
an
act
of
profound
political
consequences
but
he
stated
it
again
eloquently
that
it
was
the
court’s
duty
to
obtain
evidence
if
it
were
material
to
the
trial.
the
notion
that
political
consequences
should
stay
the
hand
of
the
court
is
a
notion
that,
again
speaking
through
marshall,
the
court
rejected
in
cohens
against
virginia
and
the
cherokee
nation
case
where
it
was
common
knowledge
that
the
state
legislatures
in
virginia,
in
georgia,
would
interpose
themselves
and
defy
this
court.
and
marshall
uttered
the
words,
which
i
think
are
justly
famous,
“just
as
the
court
can’t
reach
out
for
jurisdiction
it
doesn’t
have,
it
has
an
obligation
to
exercise
the
jurisdiction
it
does
have
whatever
may
be
the
political
consequences
of
that
act.”
the
court’s
action
in
ex
parte
milligan
in
telling
president
lincoln
that
he
did
not
have
the
power
to
conduct
the
civil
war
the
way
he
wanted
to
conduct
it,
again,
profound
political
consequences.
come
to
the
war
power
cases
in
world
war
ii,
the
japanese
exclusion
cases,
this
court
did
not
say
because
of
the
consequences
for
the
president
or
because
of
the
political
reaction
to
a
decision
one
way
or
the
other
the
court
should
stay
its
hand.
in
youngstown,
our
colleague’s
brief
closes
by
quoting
justice
frankfurter’s
brilliant
concurring
opinion
saying
how
the
court
should,
as
an
institution,
be
reluctant
to
decide
great
constitutional
questions.
but,
he
went
on
to
say
we
have
an
obligation
to
look
into
an
assertion
of
presidential
power.
and
even
if
the
embarrassment
to
be
caused
to
the
president
by
our
disagreeing
with
him
would
be
profound,
it
is
still
the
duty
of
the
court
to
tell
him
when
he’s
wrong.
this
court,
in
powell
against
mccormack,
how
could
there
be
a
more
political
case
than
telling
a
house
of
congress
that
it
had
to
see
the
member
that
it
excluded.
but,
the
court
said
the
constitution
forbad
it.
it’s
up
to
the
court
to
decide
what
the
constitution
allows,
and
even
though
the
court
interprets
the
constitution
differently
from
another
branch,
that’s
the
judicial
process.
so,
separation
of
powers
here
with
the
notion
of
political
question
whether
something
is
committed
to
the
final
determination
of
another
branch
far
from
supporting
the
president’s
position
demands
that
the
court
affirm
the
action
that
judge
sirica
has
taken.
this
is
emphatically
the
providence
of
this
court
to
decide.
not
to
belabor
the
point,
but
perhaps
the
finest
chapter
in
the
court’s
recent
history
has
come
upon
these
chapters
and
had
come
in
the
fields
of
reapportionment,
civil
rights,
and
the
procedural
rights
of
the
criminally
accused
would
be
naïve
to
say
that
those
were
not
profoundly
politically
important
decisions
but
they
were
made
as
decisions
of
constitutional
law
despite
the
consequences
that
political
branches
might
face.
despite
the
public
reaction,
the
court
understood
its
duty
to
interpret
the
constitution.
that’s
all
we
ask
for
today.
that’s
all
judge
sirica
has
done.
we
believe
he
has
done
it
correctly.
we
believe
the
case
is
fully
justiciable.
we
believe
the
principles
that
have
been
briefed
by
the
parties
support
the
correctness
of
the
decision
below.
and,
we
submit
that
this
court
should
fully
explicitly
and
decisively
and
definitively
uphold
judge
sirica’s
decision.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
advert
first
to
procedural
questions
that
mr.
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
stewart
have
raised
about
whether
the
mandamus
case
is
properly
here.
mr.
justice,
we
did,
in
our
certiorari
petition,
refer
to
the
fact
that
we
were
trying
to
bring
before
the
court
for
review
before
judgment
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
order
of
the
district
court
which
we
said
the
president
had
tried
to
obtain
review
of
in
two
ways
in
two
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
gave
the
docket
numbers
of
those
two
cases.
and,
that
certiorari
petition
was
filed
on
may
24
and
judge
sirica,
who
was
the
respondent
as
justice
stewart
properly
notes
in
the
mandamus
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
was
served
with
a
copy
of
the
certiorari
petition
as
he
had
been
served
with
the
mandamus
petition
as,
indeed,
had
all
the
respondents
who
were
otherwise
before
the
court,
the
defendants
in
united
states
against
mitchell.
on
may
28
in
accordance
with
a
motion
that
was
filed
in
a
court
of
appeals,
a
copy
of
which
i
believe
is
in
the
files
of
this
court,
the
court
of
appeals
transmitted
to
this
court
the
records
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
appeal
and
the
mandamus
cases.
now,
mr.
justice
stewart,
with
respect
to
judge
sirica’s
appearance
here,
he
is
a
party
before
this
court
and
i
believe
there
is
a
letter
on
file
with
the
clerk
of
this
court
from
judge
sirica
in
which
he
states
that
he
will
not
appear
separately
the
united
states
through
the
special
prosecutors
appearing
on
behalf
of
judge
sirica
as,
indeed,
we
would
have
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
uphold
his
decision
enforcing
our
subpoena.
so
the
case,
procedurally,
is
properly
before
the
court
both
with
respect
to
the
appeal
and
the
mandamus
proceedings.
i’d
like
to—
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well
i
think,
normally,
you
might
start
with
17c
end
because
that
would
provide
for
a
conceivably
for
disposition
on
non-constitutional
grounds
if
you
found
that
we
had
not
made
a
sufficient
showing
to
satisfy
the
ordinary
requirements
of
the
rule.
so,
in
accordance
with
court’s
normal
jurisprudence
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
absolutely,
he
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
have
made
the
suggestion
that
any
appellant
court
reviewing
this
kind
of
determination
applies
the
standard
of
whether
the
district
judge
was
intimately
familiar
with
this
indictment
and
with
the
49-page
appendix
showing
that
we
submitted
in
demonstrating
why
each
of
these
64
subpoenaed
conversations
was
material.
he
made
the
finding
that
we
had
clearly
demonstrated
relevance
and
an
evidentiary
nature
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
and
your
standard
review
should
be
whether
he
has
abused
his
discretion.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
clearly
erroneous
standard,
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i’m
sorry,
which
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
parties
are
in
agreement
that
bowman
dairy
and
iozia
that
district
court
decision
established
the
basic
criteria
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
we
have
suggested
that
it’s
possible
that
a
lower
standard
can
be
applied.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
my
position
would
be
that
when
you’re
talking
about
a
subpoena
to
a
third
party,
as
distinguished
from
an
intra-case
subpoena
between
government
and
defendant,
a
lower
standard
or
relevancy
or
materiality
should
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
we
have
suggested
that
even
if
the
proper
standard
is
applied,
that
we
meet
that
standard
because
of
the
showing
that
we
made
that
each
of
these
items
is
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
necessity
in
a
sense
of
being
relevant
to
the
issues
to
be
tried
and
being
of
an
evidentiary
nature.
now,
the
necessity
standard
comes
in
more
in
determining
whether
the
executive
privilege
claim
should
be
overwritten
if,
apart
from
the
waiver
fact
and
what
we
call
the
clot
point
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that,
obviously,
we
don’t
think
is
a
proper
legal
standard
and
the
courts
have
said.
in
fact,
we
go
back
to
chief
justice
marshall’s
opinion
in
the
burr
case
where
exactly
the
same
suggestion
was
made
by
the
united
states
attorney
in
opposing
the
subpoena,
that
burr
hasn’t
specified
which
portions
of
general
wilkinson’s
letter
were
really
going
to
be
material.
and
chief
justice
marshall
applied
with
his
eloquent
common
sense,
of
course
not,
because
he
hasn’t
seen
the
letter
yet
but
he’s
made
a
sufficient
averment
that
it
does
contain
something
material,
that
at
least
it
should
be
brought
into
court.
now
we
have,
as
i
say,
gone
much
further
than
colonel
burr
did.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
when
you’re
talking
about
a
subpoena
between
the
parties,
yes,
sir.
they
talked
about
other
criteria,
which
i
think
are
really
subsumed
whether
it’s
a
fishing
expedition,
whether
you’re
going
off
on
a
frolic.
but
as
the
later
cases,
as
i
believe
judge
sirica
indicates,
seem
to
have
distilled
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
it’d
be
critical?
no,
sir,
i
don’t
believe
so.
i
think
that,
as
you
were
suggesting
before
and
as
judge
sirica
held,
it’s
never
been
the
law
that
once
an
indictment
is
returned
the
prosecution
is
not
entitled
to
continue
gathering
evidence.
the
burdens
of
proof
before
a
grand
jury
and
a
trial
jury
are
clearly
different.
it’s
an
abuse
of
the
grand
jury
process
that
has
been
held
to
use
a
grand
jury
subpoena,
as
mr.
st.
clair
suggested,
to
continue
gathering
evidence
after
an
indictment
is
returned.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
i
hope
i’m
not
conceding
more
than
i
should.
but,
the
rule
does
talk
about
subpoenaing
material
from
a
person
on
a
showing
that
it
will
be
relevant.
it’s
rule
17
and
i’m
talking
a
position
which
is
narrower
than,
of
course,
you’re
suggesting,
mr.
justice,
that
i
might
take.
but,
in
all
candor,
the
rule
talks
about
subpoenaing
documents
from
a
person
not
only
from
a
party.
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
believe
you
earlier
mentioned
that
the
rule
applied
only
to
subpoenas
to
parties,
but
the
rule
specifically
provides
for
subpoenas
to
persons
who
are
not
parties
to
the
case.
but
it
says,
and
this
was
the
clause
that
we
were
relying
on
here,
the
court
may
direct
that
the
books
or
papers
be
produced
before
the
court
at
a
time
prior
to
the
trial
or
prior
to
the
time
when
they
are
to
be
offered
in
evidence.
so,
there
does
seem
to
be
some
natural
focus
about
the
evidentiary
nature
of
the
materials.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
sir.
we
insist,
as
judge
sirica
found,
that
with
citation
of
chapter
and
verse,
if
i
may,
in
our
49-page
showing
before
the
district
court
with
references
to
sworn
testimony
as
well
as
with
representations
about
what
witnesses
will
testify
trial
we
demonstrated
why
each
of
these
subpoenaed
conversations
satisfies
the
bowman
dairy
v.
iozia
rule
17c
standard.
now,
that
leads
me
into
the
related
point.
what
is
the
relevance
of
the
grand
jury’s
finding
that
the
president
was
a
co-conspirator
in
this
case?
it
has
been
alleged
that
we
did
this
in
order
to
prejudice
the
president’s
rights.
i
think
we
have
sought
to
demonstrate
in
our
reply
brief
that
that
was
in
no
sense
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes.
normally,
i
will
concede,
it
is
not
the
practice,
as
anyone
who’s
been
a
prosecutor
knows,
for
the
grand
jury
if
it
is
not
identifying
the
co-conspirators
in
the
body
of
its
indictment
to
place
them
on
the
record.
it
is
fairly
common
practice,
however,
for
an
indictment
to
say
in
addition
to
the
defendants
named
persons
or
unindicted
co-conspirators.
this
is
not
an
ordinary
case
and
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
that
was
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
get
to
in
discussing
what
we
call
our
clot
argument.
we
have
never
argued,
and
of
course
there
would
be
no
basis
for
arguing
that
the
mere
grand
jury
finding,
whether
on
the
face
of
the
indictment
or
in
the
grand
jury’s
minutes,
that
the
president
or
any
of
the
other
18
unindicted
co-conspirators
were
members
of
this
conspiracy
would,
itself,
be
enough
at
trial
to
want
judge’s
admission
of
extra
judicial
statements
given
by
those
co-conspirators.
we
are
not
making
that
contention
here.
the
issue
arises
because
a
motion
to
quash
a
subpoena
was
filed
prior
to
trial.
and,
the
basis
for
that
motion
was
a
claim
of
executive
privilege,
a
governmental
privilege
that
exists
fro
the
benefit
of
legitimate
governmental
processes.
we
countered
that
apart
from
nixon
versus
sirica
and
the
balancing
process,
and
apart
from
the
waiver
argument
that
we
also
develop
in
some
length,
this
president,
as
difficult
as
it
was
to
say
this
not
because
of
the
evidence
but
because
of
the
inherent
awkwardness
of
it,
this
president
is
not
in
a
position
to
claim
this
public
privilege
for
the
reason
that
a
prima
facie
showing
can
be
made
that
these
conversations
were
not
in
pursuance
of
legitimate
governmental
processes
or
the
lawful
deliberation
of
the
public’s
business.
these
conversations,
as
we
showed
in
our
49-page
appendix
and
as
the
grand
jury
alleged,
were
in
furtherance
of
the
criminal
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
and
obstruct
justice.
we
did
not
rely
even
before
judge
sirica
and
we
do
not
rely
here
merely
on
the
fact
that
the
grand
jury
made
this
determination.
we
do
submit
that,
for
purposes
of
a
pretrial
consideration
of
a
subpoena
that
is
challenged
on
grounds
of
executive
privilege,
we
are
not
confronted
with
the
need
that
we
will
be
confronted
with
a
trial
in
which
we
fully
intend
to
discharge
of
showing
by
evidence
to
the
trial
judge
that
the
president
and
the
other
co-conspirators
were
members
of
the
co-conspirators.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
sir,
and
we
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
no,
absolutely
not
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i’m
sorry.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
let
me
back
up
a
little.
i
see
the
point
that
you’re
making.
we
are
taking
the
position
that
the
grand
jury’s
determination
is
conclusive
on
the
court
on
two
issues:
(a)
that
a
conspiracy
existed,
and
(b)
that
president
nixon
was
a
member
of
the
conspiracy.
that
is
not
enough,
we
concede,
to
override
a
claim
of
executive
privilege
because,
as
mr.
st.
clair
well
says,
he
is
still
the
president
and
he
still
is
in
the
position
to
invoke
executive
privilege.
where
we
had
said
we
must
bear
an
evidentiary
burden
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
is
on
drawing
the
nexus
between
the
subpoenaed
conversations
and
the
conclusively
determined
prima
facie
showing
that
there
is
a
conspiracy
in
which
the
president
is
a
member.
we
made
that
evidentiary
showing
to
judge
sirica.
that
showing
is
before
this
court.
judge
sirica
found
that
showing
was
sufficient
and
for
that
reason,
as
i
believe
his
opinion
although
it
had
to
be
guarded
because
these
items
were
placed
under
seal,
reflects
that
he
did
make
the
showing.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
sir.
it
could
have
been
made
as
an
evidentiary
matter,
but
we
are
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
pardon
me?
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
sir.
the
evidence
that
was
placed
before
judge
sirica,
we
would
submit,
would
be
sufficient
to
make
that
showing.
now,
we
have
said
that
that
is
not
legally
necessary.
that
we
did
not
have
to
make,
didn’t
have
to
prove
a
conspiracy,
in
effect,
prove
the
whole
case
that
may
take
three
months
to
try
in
order
to
defeat
a
claim
of
executive
privilege
before
trial.
this
court
has
frequently
said
that
criminal
process
would
be
burdened
down
unduly
if
proceedings
were
preceded
by
many
proceedings.
that’s
exactly
what
we
have
here.
we
submit
the
evidence
is
sufficient.
judge
sirica,
the
evidence,
this
is
a
situation
in
which
the
showing
that
we
did
submit
intrinsically,
we
submit,
tracks
the
allegations
of
the
indictment
and
provides
independent
evidentiary
support
for
those
allegations.
we
have
said,
though,
that
it
is
not
legally
necessary
in
a
proceeding
like
this
for
the
court
independently
to
decide
whether
the
grand
jury
had
enough
evidence
before
it
to
say
there
is
a
conspiracy
or
that
a
particular
individual
was
a
member
of
the
conspiracy.
we
said
all
you
need
to
find
is
that
we
have
shown
that
these
conversations
were
in
furtherance
of
that
conspiracy.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
have
not
expressed
a
position
on
that,
mr.
justice
powell.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
yes,
we
argue
that
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
we
do,
in
fact,
make
that
argument
at
some
length.
i
guess
all
of
our
arguments
are
made
with
too
much
length,
but
we
do
argue
at
length,
sir,
seriously
that
the
question
of
presidential
indictability
which
we
offer
some
views
on
just
to
show
that
het
question
is
an
open
one
because
of
our
obligation,
we
believe
to
the
law
and
to
the
court,
is
not
really
determinative
of
the
question
that
is
really
in
this
case
to
the
extent
that
the
court
reaches
the
expungement
argument
advanced
by
counsel
or
to
the
extent
that
the
court
does
not
reach
the
so-called
clark
argument
that
executive
privilege
just
cannot
be
invoked
here.
the
issue
of
presidential
indictability
does
not
determine
the
issue
whether
an
incumbent
president
can
be
named
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator
by
a
grand
jury.
we
have
shown
in
our
brief
why
even
persons
who
do
have
some
constitutional
immunity,
and
counsel
argues
that,
implicitly
under
the
framework
of
the
constitution
the
president
should
have
an
implicit
immunity
from
prosecution
even
such
persons
can
be
and
frequently
are
named
by
grand
jury
as
unindicted
co-conspirators.
the
practical
arguments
that
may
militate
in
favor
of
a
judicial
recognition
of
some
unique
immunity
for
the
president
alone,
not
for
circuit
judges,
not
for
supreme
court
justices,
not
for
members
of
congress
but
the
president
alone,
it
may
be
held
at
some
later
date,
is
immune
from
prosecution
but,
by
no
means,
suggest
the
answer
to
the
question
here.
and,
the
grand
jury
elected
not
to
test
that
issue.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
it
is,
mr.
justice,
and
there’s
no
doubt
about
it.
we
are
conscious
of
the
delicacy
of
the
issue.
we
have
suggested,
however,
that
although
there
is
some
conceivable
opportunity
for
abuse
our
judicial
system,
our
democratic
system,
is
based
on
a
several
fundamental
propositions.
one
of
which
is
that
grand
juries
usually
are
not
malicious.
even
prosecutors
cannot
be
assumed
to
be
malicious.
we
also
assume,
as
this
court
regularly
holds
in
first
amendment
cases
dealing
with
public
officials,
that
we
have
a
resilient
society
where
people
can
be
trusted
to
sort
out
truth
from
falsity.
we
have
a
robust
debate.
i
submit
to
you,
sir,
that
just
as
in
this
case
a
grand
jury
would
not
likely
accuse
the
president
of
a
crime.
so,
to
that
fear
that
perhaps
without
basis
some
grand
jury
somewhere
might
maliciously
accuse
a
president
of
a
crime
is
not
necessarily
a
compelling
reason
for
saying
that
a
grand
jury
has
no
power
to
do
that.
i
think
the
system
may
be
vibrant
enough
to
deal
with
that
and
i
think
the
inherent
dignity
of
the
presidential
office
and
any
incumbent
providing
him
with
a
notable
check
against
being
defeated
or,
as
my
colleague
says,
impeached
by
the
action
of
a
grand
jury.
this
is
perhaps
the
most
notorious
event
and
notorious
case
in
recent
times.
when
the
grand
jury’s
action
was
disclosed,
i
venture
to
say
that
although
it
was
difficult
time
for
all
concerned,
including
prosecutors
as
well
as
other
counsel
and
the
president
and
the
country.
the
president
has
not
been
displaced
from
office.
he
still
is
president.
he
still
functions
in
accordance
with
his
constitutional
powers.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
64,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
to
foreclose
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
answer
to
my
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
yes
because
these
are
the
procedures
that
have
been
set
up
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
of
nixon
versus
sirica
which
were
found
to
be
eminently
practical
when
the
tapes
subpoenaed
by
the
grand
jury
were
submitted.
these
are
six-hour
reels
and,
under
the
so-called
index
and
analysis
which
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
required
to
be
submitted
and
which
judge
sirica
here
has
required
to
be
submitted,
counsel
for
the
president
says
this
is
a
six-hour
reel.
the
watergate-related
portions
are
minutes
312
--
no,
that’s
too
many
--
112
through
146.
prior
to
that,
there
is
a
meeting
between
the
presidnet
and
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
on
a
school
bill.
after
the
watergate-related
discussions,
there
is
a
meeting
between
the
president
and
representatives
of
the
national
association
of
manufacturers.
what
has
happened
is
that
white
house
counsel
has
come
to
the
judge’s
chambers
with
the
original
reels.
they
have
marked
the
beginning
of
the
watergate-related
portions
on
those
reels
for
the
court
to
make
his
independent
determination.
this
is
watergate-related
and,
therefore,
offset
by
whatever
overcoming
of
the
privilege
has
been
held.
and
after
that
is
done,
a
copy
of
the
watergate-related
portions
is
made.
the
judge
does
not
listen
to
the
non-watergate-related
portions
which
are
still
covered
by
a
presumptive
executive
privilege
which
we
have
freely
conceded
from
the
time
the
grand
jury
began
this
process
in
july
of
’73
to
our
briefs
in
this
court.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that’s
correct,
sir,
and
i
might
say
that
under
the
procedure
that
was
worked
out,
this
may
pre-date
mr.
st.
clair
so
you’ll
have
to
rely
solely
on
my
representation,
president
indicated
a
willingness
to
allow
the
judge
to
listen
to
a
few
moments
of
conversation
on
either
end
of
the
portion
of
the
tape
that
had
been
listed
in
this
index
and
analysis
as
being
watergate-related
just
so
he
would
have
an
assurance
that
there
was
a
transition
from
one
subject
to
another
subject.
that
was
created
by
the
president
as
being
--
if
a
minimal
intrusion
on
the
confidentiality
privilege
for
an
unrelated
subject
certainly,
by
no
means,
an
excessive
one.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
that
was
to
be
my
last
point,
sir,
and
i
will
make
it
right
now.
the
notion
that
because
there
is
concurrently
underway
an
impeachment
inquiry
before
the
house
of
representatives
that,
somehow,
makes
this
a
non-justiciable
political
question.
it
is,
we
think,
a
remarkable
notion
which
is
not
supported
by
sound
and
constitutional
law
or
by
any
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
and
indeed,
i
submit,
that
to
the
extent
that
the
court
has
discretion
in
the
matter
and
although
this
court
has
now
been
given
discretionary
certiorari
power,
district
courts
have
no
such
option.
it
would
not
even
be
a
wise
exercise
of
discretion
for
this
court
to
stay
its
hand.
this
case
before
the
court
is
not
a
request
for
an
opinion
between
two
congressional
committees
as
to
who
has
jurisdiction
over
a
particular
bill.
it’s
not
even
a
request
for
a
dispute
between
cabinet
officers
or
the
president
and
a
cabinet
officer
over
what
proper
executive
policy
ought
to
be.
this
is
a
criminal
proceeding
of
federal
criminal
case
against
six
defendants.
a
subpoena
had
been
issued
to
obtain
evidence
for
use
at
the
trial
which
is
scheduled
to
begin
on
september
9.
the
court
cannot
escape
the
fact
that
this
is
a
trial
of
tremendous
national
importance,
but
a
trial
that
was
brought
to
ahead
without
regard
to
the
impeachment
inquiry.
this
is
an
independent
separate
constitutional
process
that
is
underway,
and
a
traditional
prosaic
remedy.
a
subpoena
has
been
utilized
to
obtain
evidence
for
that
trial.
there’s
some
debate
about
whether
the
evidence
is
critical
to
our
prosecution.
i
know
that
in
justice
rehnquist’s
opinion
a
few
weeks
ago
in
michigan
against
tucker
that
he
echoed
or
presaged
perhaps
the
same
point
that
judge
sirica
made
that
it’s
really
the
obligation
of
the
prosecution
to
present
all
of
the
material
evidence
for
the
jury,
for
the
fact-finder
to
pass
upon.
that’s
what
this
case
involves.
now
to
say
that
there
will
be
public
consequences,
even
political
consequences,
to
the
court’s
action
does
not
mean
this
is
a
political
question
so
that
the
court
must
regard
it
as
non-justiciable.
the
same
argument
would
have
prevented
this
court
from
deciding
marbury
and
madison.
it’s
common
knowledge
that
chief
justice
marshall,
himself,
was
threatened
with
impeachment
if
he
decided
the
case
against
president
jefferson.
he
went
ahead
and
did
his
duty
on
behalf
of
this
court.
later,
in
connection
with
the
burr
trial
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
no,
sir.
he
says
that,
expressly
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
well,
if
you
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
the
case
is
normally
thought
of
as
being
solely
concerned
with
original
jurisdiction.
but
if
--
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
if
one
reads
the
case
again,
sir,
i
submit,
chief
justice
marshall
got
to
the
original
jurisdiction
point
only
after
he
had
been
very
decisive
in
saying
that
a
lower
court
could
issue
and
should
issue
and
would
be
obliged
to
issue
the
mandamus
to
secretary
madison
because
the
president
had
not
legal
power
to
order
secretary
of
state
madison
not
to
issue
that
commission.
he
held
that.
it
might
be
called
dictum
but
it
certainly,
at
the
time,
was
a
courageous
act.
mr.
philip
a.
lacovara
i
concede
that,
sir.
later,
however,
when
he
did
go
on
in
1807
to
issue
the
subpoena
to
president
jefferson,
that
was
an
act
of
profound
political
consequences
but
he
stated
it
again
eloquently
that
it
was
the
court’s
duty
to
obtain
evidence
if
it
were
material
to
the
trial.
the
notion
that
political
consequences
should
stay
the
hand
of
the
court
is
a
notion
that,
again
speaking
through
marshall,
the
court
rejected
in
cohens
against
virginia
and
the
cherokee
nation
case
where
it
was
common
knowledge
that
the
state
legislatures
in
virginia,
in
georgia,
would
interpose
themselves
and
defy
this
court.
and
marshall
uttered
the
words,
which
i
think
are
justly
famous,
“just
as
the
court
can’t
reach
out
for
jurisdiction
it
doesn’t
have,
it
has
an
obligation
to
exercise
the
jurisdiction
it
does
have
whatever
may
be
the
political
consequences
of
that
act.”
the
court’s
action
in
ex
parte
milligan
in
telling
president
lincoln
that
he
did
not
have
the
power
to
conduct
the
civil
war
the
way
he
wanted
to
conduct
it,
again,
profound
political
consequences.
come
to
the
war
power
cases
in
world
war
ii,
the
japanese
exclusion
cases,
this
court
did
not
say
because
of
the
consequences
for
the
president
or
because
of
the
political
reaction
to
a
decision
one
way
or
the
other
the
court
should
stay
its
hand.
in
youngstown,
our
colleague’s
brief
closes
by
quoting
justice
frankfurter’s
brilliant
concurring
opinion
saying
how
the
court
should,
as
an
institution,
be
reluctant
to
decide
great
constitutional
questions.
but,
he
went
on
to
say
we
have
an
obligation
to
look
into
an
assertion
of
presidential
power.
and
even
if
the
embarrassment
to
be
caused
to
the
president
by
our
disagreeing
with
him
would
be
profound,
it
is
still
the
duty
of
the
court
to
tell
him
when
he’s
wrong.
this
court,
in
powell
against
mccormack,
how
could
there
be
a
more
political
case
than
telling
a
house
of
congress
that
it
had
to
see
the
member
that
it
excluded.
but,
the
court
said
the
constitution
forbad
it.
it’s
up
to
the
court
to
decide
what
the
constitution
allows,
and
even
though
the
court
interprets
the
constitution
differently
from
another
branch,
that’s
the
judicial
process.
so,
separation
of
powers
here
with
the
notion
of
political
question
whether
something
is
committed
to
the
final
determination
of
another
branch
far
from
supporting
the
president’s
position
demands
that
the
court
affirm
the
action
that
judge
sirica
has
taken.
this
is
emphatically
the
providence
of
this
court
to
decide.
not
to
belabor
the
point,
but
perhaps
the
finest
chapter
in
the
court’s
recent
history
has
come
upon
these
chapters
and
had
come
in
the
fields
of
reapportionment,
civil
rights,
and
the
procedural
rights
of
the
criminally
accused
would
be
naïve
to
say
that
those
were
not
profoundly
politically
important
decisions
but
they
were
made
as
decisions
of
constitutional
law
despite
the
consequences
that
political
branches
might
face.
despite
the
public
reaction,
the
court
understood
its
duty
to
interpret
the
constitution.
that’s
all
we
ask
for
today.
that’s
all
judge
sirica
has
done.
we
believe
he
has
done
it
correctly.
we
believe
the
case
is
fully
justiciable.
we
believe
the
principles
that
have
been
briefed
by
the
parties
support
the
correctness
of
the
decision
below.
and,
we
submit
that
this
court
should
fully
explicitly
and
decisively
and
definitively
uphold
judge
sirica’s
decision.
