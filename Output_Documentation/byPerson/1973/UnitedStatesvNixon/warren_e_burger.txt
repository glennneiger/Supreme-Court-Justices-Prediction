we’ll
hear
arguments
in
73-1766,
united
states
of
america
against
nixon
and
the
cross-petition,
richard
m.
nixon
against
the
united
states.
mr.
jaworski,
there
has
been
a
request
for
additional
time.
the
court
then
set
additional
time
of
one-and-a
half
hours,
i
understand.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it’ll
be
allowed
to
each
side
and
we
will
not
interrupt
the
argument
with
any
recess.
we’ll
go
right
through
until
you’re
finished.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready,
mr.
jaworski.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
do
not
suggest
that
that’s
all
you
need
to
show.
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
submitting
himself
to
the
judicial
process
in
the
same
sense
that
you
are,
is
that
not
so,
mr.
jaworski?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
take
one
position
and
he
takes
another.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
this
matter
may
be
one
of
semantics.
each
of
you
is
taking
a
different
position
on
the
basic
question
and
each
of
you
is
submitting
for
decision
to
this
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
it
would
further
narrow
the
area
if,
as
i
take
it
from
your
briefs,
you
do
emphasize
there
is
no
claim
here
of
typical
military
secrets
or
diplomatic
secrets
or
what,
in
the
burr
case,
were
referred
to
as
state
secretes.
none
of
those
things
are
in
this
case.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
he
filed
any
brief
or
made
an
appearance
at
all
in
any
sense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
sawyer
against
rose
i
thought
we
held
that
there
is
a
common
law
privilege
in
the
executives
dealing
at
the
state
level,
but
that
it
is
a
qualified
privilege,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
“has
taken
a
good
close
look,”
without
looking
at
the
evidence
sometimes
has
taken
a
good
close
look
at
the
claim
and
the
basis
of
the
claim.
is
that
what
you
mean?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
that
the
issue,
mr.
jaworski,
or
is
the
issue
whether
there
could
be
a
collateral
attack?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
brady
question
really
lurks
just
in
the
background,
does
it
not?
that
is,
if
you
get
information,
whatever
you
get
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
concede
is
available
to
any
defendant
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
can
make
the
showing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
st.
clair.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
now
talking
about
the
bypassing
of
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
we
dismiss
this
appeal
as
improvidently
granted,
it
would
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
not
sure,
perhaps
you
can
help
me.
are
you
suggesting
that
there
was
some
duty
on
the
part
of
the
special
prosecutor
to
disclose
to
the
district
judge
that
there
was
this
secret
indictment
before
the
judge
passed
on
whether
the
material
should
be
sent
to
the
house?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
does
not
the
special
prosecutor
claim
that
the
subject
matter
is
the
same?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
st.
clair,
going
back
to
this
murder
witness
situation.
if
the
president,
any
president,
witnessed
an
automobile
accident
and
was
the
sole
witness
of
murder,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested,
you’re
not
indicating
that
his
testimony,
his
evidence,
would
not
be
available
to
the
court
but
merely
that
he
can’t
be
subpoenaed
but
might
give
it
back
by
deposition
as
several
presidents
have
in
the
past.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
testimony
of
the
justices
of
this
court
has
been
given
in
past
times
by
depositions,
has
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
st.
clair,
you
left
me
in
a
little
bit
of
doubt
about
this
mechanical
problem.
i
think,
perhaps,
we
diverted
you
from
it.
are
you
suggesting
that
on
a
given
tape,
which
is
a
real
type
of
thing
having
an
hour
or
more
of
material
and
maybe
several
hours
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
two
or
three
days?
i
see.
that
the
first
three
hours
might
be
the
material
which
has
already
been
transcribed
and
released,
the
next
three
or
four
hours
might
be
a
conference
with
the
joint
chief
of
staff
or
the
chairman
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
on
the
program
to
give
under
developed
nations,
for
example
aid
for
peaceful
uses
of
atomic
energy,
matters
totally
irrelevant
but
confidential.
is
that
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
want
some
mechanism
set
u
so
that
these
things
can
be
screened
out.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
you,
at
any
time,
tendered
or
proffered
a
statement
that
a
particular
tape
from
18
minutes
after
11
until
3:00
that
afternoon,
including
the
lunch
hour,
included
a
conference
with
the
secretary
of
state,
the
secretary
of
defense,
and
someone
else
having
to
do
with
totally
unrelated
matters,
has
that
kind
of
a
tender
been
made?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
no
explanation
of
why
it’s
left
out.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
particular
reason
why
at
least
the
identity
of
the
coquetries
could
not
be
made
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
were
not
so,
you
would
not
be
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
very
fact
that
the
delegation
to
mr.
jaworski
gave
him
the
right
to
contest
the
president’s
claim
of
privilege
presupposes
that
the
president
had
a
right
to
assert
the
privilege
but
not
the
right
to
assert
it
necessarily
with
complete
finality.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
what
we’re
really
arguing
about
here
today,
isn’t?
now
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
st.
clair.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
reference
to
your
point
about
whether
there
are
three
branches
or
three-and-some
fraction,
is
not
the
controller
general
something
of
an
autonomous
fractional
more
than
a-third
branch
figure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he’s
a
creature
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
may
proceed
but
not
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
may
proceed
with
reference
to
the
executive
branch
and,
i
would
assume,
with
reference
to
expenditures
of
the
legislative
branch
and
without
consulting
either
one
of
them.
is
that
not
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
jaworski,
as
i
understand
it,
is
claiming
that
he’s
somewhat
like,
not
necessarily
precisely
like
but
somewhat
like
the
controller
general.
that,
he
may
make
decisions
and
that
congress
cannot
recall
him
short
as,
i
believe,
a
15-year
term
for
the
controller
general
and
no
president
can
fire
the
controller
general.
and,
i
suppose,
the
court
could
not
fire
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
st.
clair,
you
have
not
mentioned
in
your
argument
a
few
moments
ago
on
the
question
of
the
absence
of
any
provision
for
immunity
for
judges
or
presidents,
you
haven’t
mentioned
the
holding
of
this
court
in
pierson
against
raid
whereas,
i
recall
it,
the
court
assumed
with
the
sentence
or
two
that
there
was
absolute
privilege
for
the
judiciary
but
that
the
privileges
of
the
executive,
in
that
case
a
policeman,
was
qualified.
the
court
had
no
difficulty
in
concluding
that
it
did
not
require
an
express
constitutional
provision
to
spell
out
an
absolute
privilege
for
judges.
these
were
state
judges
in
that
case
of
course.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
st.
clair,
you’re
cutting
into
your
rebuttal
time
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lacovara.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
laco—
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lacovara,
i
wanted
to
get
to
this
mechanical
question
that
mr.
st.
clair
brought
up.
assume
for
the
moment
that
a
given
tape,
one
of
the
46
is
it
that
you’re
asking
for?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
64,
i
hadn’t
transposed.
one
of
the
64
tapes
is,
in
fact,
one-eighth
of
the
total
time,
which
might
be
several
hours
apparently
because
they’re
long
tapes
but,
one-eighth
involves
discussions
of
the
people
who
are
indictment
here.
but
the
seven-eighths
of
it
in
fact,
now
you
have
to
assume
this,
includes
conferences
with
the
secretaries
of
the
cabinet,
the
joint
chiefs
of
staffs,
the
chairman
of
the
atomic
energy
commission,
very
high-level
people
and
perhaps
some
staff
people
as
well.
including
in
those
conversations
some
highly
sensitive
material,
not
sensitive
in
the
sense
that
it’s
national
military
secrets
or
diplomatic
secrets
but
sensitive
in
the
sense
of
confidentiality.
would
you
not
think
that
some
mechanism
ought
to
be
available
that
if
the
participants
are
identified,
as
you
got
them
all
identified
by
the
voluntary
submission
of
the
president
as
to
the
64,
that
if
the
participants
are
identified
in
the
timeframe
specified
that
the
certificate
of
the
major
persons
present
that
the
subject
was
atomic
energy,
all
sorts
of
other
things,
would
be
sufficient
to
foreclose
the
court
from
examining
it
in
camera.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
asking
you,
would
you
think
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then,
as
to
these
hypothetical
seven-eighths,
there
is,
you
suggest,
no
disagreement
between
you
and
mr.
st.
clair
and
mr.
jaworski,
and
you
on
the
one
hand.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
decided
it
in
favor
of
president
jefferson,
didn’t
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
didn’t?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
surely
decided
it
that
jefferson
won
the
case
of
the
battle
but
the
lost
the
war.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
a
judicial
supremacy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
in
that
sense
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
basic
ruling
in
the
case
related
to
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
court
under
article
iii,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
lacovar.
mr.
st.
clair,
you
have
15
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
st.
clair.
thank
you,
mr.
jaworski,
mr.
lacovara.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
disposition
to
announce
for
the
court
in
number
73-1766,
united
states
against
nixon
together
with
73-1834,
nixon
against
the
united
states.
we
granted
certiorari
before
judgment
in
these
cases
to
review
certain
pre-trial
orders
of
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
mitchell
and
others.
in
that
case,
several
former
aides
of
the
president
were
indicted
by
a
federal
grand
jury
for
crimes
including
conspiracy
to
obstruct
justice.
prosecution
for
the
government
was
commenced
by
a
special
prosecutor
who
had
been
appointed
by
the
attorney
general
pursuing
to
federal
regulation.
the
special
prosecutor
had
been
given
broad
authority.
he
moved
for
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
to
secure
from
the
president
as
a
third-party
certain
6
specifically
described
material,
chiefly
records
of
various
conversations
between
the
president
and
others
including
named
defendants
in
pending
cases.
the
district
court
authorized
the
subpoena
pursuant
to
rule
17
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
counsel
for
the
president
moved
to
quash
the
subpoena
on
the
grounds
first
that
the
court
lack
jurisdiction
of
the
case
and
second
that
the
courts
did
not
have
the
power
to
review
the
claim
of
executive
privilege
as
asserted
here.
the
district
court,
after
hearing,
denied
the
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena.
the
president
appealed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
on
the
same
day
the
special
prosecutor
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
before
a
judgment
in
this
court.
the
grand
jury
which
had
issued
the
indictment
in
united
states
against
mitchell
and
others
had
also
named
the
president
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator.
shortly
after
the
special
prosecutor
had
filed
his
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court,
counsel
for
the
president
filed
a
cross-petition
for
certiorari
before
a
judgment
also
challenging
the
action
of
the
grand
jury
as
improper
and
as
being
unsupported
by
the
evidence.
we
granted
both
petitions
for
certiorari,
expedited
the
consideration,
and
heard
arguments
on
july
8.
at
the
outset
we
should
say
that
we
conclude
that
the
cross-petition
raises
an
issue
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
decide
in
order
to
resolve
the
issues
of
this
case
and
the
cross-petition
is
therefore,
dismissed
as
having
been
improvidently
granted.
the
president
is
not
a
party
to
the
proceedings
for
which
the
evidence
has
sought.
he
is
a
third-party
who
has,
in
his
possession
or
under
his
control,
material
the
special
prosecutor
claims
he
needs
to
proceed
with
the
cases
now
pending
in
the
district
court.
the
special
prosecutor
made
a
preliminary
showing
to
the
district
court
satisfying
that
court
that
the
evidence
he
wanted
was
probably
relevant
to
these
cases
and
probably
would
be
admissible.
the
special
prosecutor
was
able
to
describe
what
he
wanted
in
the
subpoena
duces
tecum,
because
the
daily
logs
and
diaries
which
are
routinely
kept
in
the
white
house
were
supplied
to
him.
the
special
prosecutor’s
petition
to
this
court,
advised
that
the
case
for
which
the
evidence
was
sought
would
be
tried
in
the
district
court
early
in
september
and
that
he
needed
time
to
analyze
the
large
amount
of
material
involved.
the
first
question
that
we
decided
is
whether
we
have
jurisdiction
to
review
the
district
court’s
order
denying
the
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena.
if
it
was
a
final
order,
it
would
be
an
appealable
order.
ordinarily,
an
order
of
this
kind
is
not
regarded
as
final
and,
therefore,
not
appealable.
and
the
party
is
not
permitted
to
challenge
it
in
an
appellate
court
until
it
has
becomes
certain
that
the
district
court
will,
in
fact,
command
compliance
on
pain
of
contempt.
there
are,
however,
some
expectations
to
this,
and
this
is
one
occasion
for
such
an
exception.
to
follow
the
ordinary
procedure
in
this
case,
would
very
likely
produce
more
delay
and
defeat
the
very
purpose
of
the
rule
that
only
final
orders
are
appealable.
for
this
and
other
reasons
we,
therefore,
conclude
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction.
the
president’s
counsel
contends
in
this
case
that
it
presents
a
dispute
between
the
special
prosecutor
and
the
president
and
that
since
both
are
part
of
the
executive
branch,
it
is
an
intra-branch,
a
jurisdictional
dispute
which
can
be
resolved
only
within
the
executive
branch
and
not
in
the
courts.
however,
the
special
prosecutor
in
this
case
is
not
an
ordinary
subordinate
officer
of
the
attorney
general,
because,
by
regulation
of
the
attorney
general,
the
special
prosecutor
was
given
unique
authority
and
tenure
concerning
specific
investigations
and
prosecutions.
his
authority
is
to
represent
the
united
states
as
a
sovereign
and
it
did
include
expressed
authority
to
contest
any
privilege
asserted
by
the
executive
branch.
it
is
now
well
established
that
when
the
government
or
its
department
promulgate
regulations,
the
government
is
bound
by
those
regulations
even
though
they
may
be
revoked
or
modified.
but
until
they
are
revoked
or
until
they
are
modified,
they
have
the
force
of
law.
we,
therefore,
have
before
the
court,
a
claim
by
the
special
prosecutor
vigorously
contested
by
the
president’s
counsel
on
constitutional
ground
and
we
hold
that
this
presents
a
controversy
of
the
kind
that,
as
we
said
in
baker
against
carr
that
provides
that
concrete
adverseness
which
sharpens
the
presentation
of
issues
upon
which
the
court
so
largely
depends
for
the
illumination
of
difficult
constitutional
issues.
ordinarily,
as
we
have
indicated,
a
dispute
between
two
officers
of
the
executive
branch
is
not
a
subject
to
be
settled
but
litigation
in
the
courts.
but
this
case
presents
one
of
the
unusual
exceptions
and
we,
therefore,
find
no
barrier
to
justiciability.
if
we
were
to
decide
that
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
was
not
properly
issued
in
the
first
place,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter
and
no
other
issues
would
call
for
resolution
by
this
court.
however,
from
our
examination
of
the
materials
submitted
by
the
special
prosecutor
and
supported
his
motion
for
the
subpoena,
we
are
satisfied
that
the
district
court
acted
within
its
powers
under
rule
17
(c)
for
the
production
of
the
evidence
before
trial.
in
the
performance
of
assigned
constitutional
duties
each
branch
of
the
government
must
initially
interpret
the
constitution,
and
the
interpretation
of
its
powers
by
any
one
branch
is
due
great
respect
from
the
others.
the
president’s
counsel
reads
the
constitution
as
providing
an
absolute
privilege
of
confidentiality
for
all
presidential
communications.
many
decisions
of
this
court,
however,
have
unequivocally
reaffirmed
the
holding
of
marbury
against
madison
in
1803
that
it
is
emphatically
the
province
and
duty
of
the
judicial
department
to
say
what
the
law
is.
our
system
of
government
requires
that
federal
courts
on
occasion
interpret
the
constitution
in
a
manner
at
variance
with
the
construction
given
to
that
document
by
another
branch.
any
other
inclusion
would
be
contrary
to
the
basic
concept
of
separation
of
powers
and
the
checks
and
balances
that
flow
from
the
scheme
of
a
tripartite
government.
we
therefore
reaffirm
what
was
said
in
marbury
against
madison
that
it
is
emphatically
the
province
and
duty
of
this
court
to
say
what
the
law
is
with
respect
to
a
claim
of
privilege,
such
as
presented
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
very
novel
about
a
claim
of
governmental
privilege
asserted
in
litigation
in
federal
courts.
for
example,
in
the
waterman
steamship
case
in
1948,
a
case
that
dealt
with
the
president’s
power
relating
to
foreign
airlines
where
a
decision
of
the
president
had
to
be
made
in
camera
on
confidential
reports
and
studies
relating
to
foreign
relations,
the
court
sustained
the
privilege
of
the
president.
in
united
states
against
reynolds
in
1952,
claims
were
made
against
the
united
states
for
the
death
of
various
persons
and
the
injury
of
others
in
the
crash
of
an
experimental
airplane,
which
was
being
tested
for
military
usage.
there,
the
government’s
claim
was
based
on
the
secrecy
of
these
very
confidential
and
secret
military
instruments.
in
each
case,
waterman
and
reynolds,
the
claim
of
privilege
was
upheld
by
the
courts.
however,
there
are
important
differences
and
only
a
few
of
them
need
to
be
mentioned
here
today.
first,
the
waterman
steamship
and
reynolds
case
were
not
criminal
cases
and
the
government
was
not
in
the
posture
of
a
third-party
in
possession
of
relevant
evidence.
moreover,
those
cases,
as
i
have
noted,
involved
confidential
military
and
diplomatic
information,
but
here
the
claim
of
privilege
rests
simply
on
the
generalized
undifferentiated
claim
of
the
need
to
keep
all
the
presidential
communications
private
and
confidential.
we
had
once
recognized
the
high
difference
that
is
due
to
protect
all
of
the
communications
of
the
president.
as
early
as
the
case
of
united
states
against
burr,
1807,
chief
justice
marshall
sitting
as
a
trial
judge
had
authorised
to
subpoena
to
president
jefferson
to
secure
certain
letters
in
the
possession
of
the
president.
and
marshall
noted,
among
many
other
important
passages
in
that
opinion
that
in
no
case
of
this
kind
would
a
court
be
required
to
proceed
against
the
president
as
against
an
ordinary
individual.
however,
the
deference,
traditionally
shown
by
the
courts
toward
a
president,
does
not
mean
that
all
material
in
the
possession
of
a
president
is
immune
in
all
circumstances
from
judicial
process.
we
recognize
the
importance
of
the
need
to
protect
the
confidentiality
of
the
communication
of
a
president
with
his
aides
and
advisors
and
we
recognize
the
risk
that
publication
of
those
communications
may
well
have
an
adverse
effect
on
the
ability
of
a
president
to
secure
candid
advice
and
the
proposing
views
on
important
questions.
however,
no
case
of
this
court
has
extended
this
high
degree
of
deference
to
a
president’s
generalized
need
of
confidentiality.
nowhere
in
the
constitution
is
there
any
explicit
reference
to
the
privilege
of
confidentiality.
yet
to
the
extent
this
interest
relates
to
the
effective
discharge
of
a
president’s
powers,
it
is
constitutionally
based.
in
this
case
we
must
weigh
the
importance
of
the
general
privilege
of
confidentiality
of
presidential
communications
in
the
performance
of
his
responsibilities
against
the
inroads
of
such
a
privilege
on
the
fair
administration
of
criminal
justice.
although
the
interest
in
preserving
confidentiality
is,
as
we
have
noted,
very
weighty
indeed
and
entitled
to
great
respect,
we
cannot
conclude
that
advisors
will
be
moved
to
temper
the
candor
of
their
remarks
by
the
infrequent
occasions
of
disclosure
that
maybe
brought
about
because
of
the
possibility
that
such
conversations
will
be
called
for
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
on
the
other
hand,
the
allowance
of
the
privilege
to
withhold
evidence
that
is
demonstrably
relevant
in
a
criminal
trial
would
cut
deeply
into
the
guarantee
of
due
process
of
law
and
gravely
impair
the
basic
function
of
the
courts
under
article
iii.
a
president’s
acknowledged
need
for
confidentiality
in
the
communications
of
his
office
is
general
in
nature,
whereas
the
constitutional
need
for
production
of
relevant
evidence
in
a
criminal
proceeding
is
specific
and
central
to
the
fair
adjudication
of
a
particular
criminal
case
in
the
administration
of
justice.
without
access
to
specific
facts
a
criminal
prosecution
may
be
totally
frustrated.
the
president’s
broad
interest
in
confidentiality
of
communications
will
not,
in
our
view,
vitiated
by
disclosure
of
a
limited
number
of
conversations
which
have
preliminarily
been
shown
to
have
some
bearing
on
a
pending
criminal
case.
we
conclude,
therefore,
that
when
the
ground
for
asserting
of
the
privilege
as
to
subpoenaed
materials,
sought
for
use
in
a
criminal
trial,
is
based
solely
on
the
generalized
interest
in
confidentiality
as
distinguished
from
the
situations
whereat
maybe
based
upon
military
secret
or
diplomatic
secrets,
it
cannot
prevail
over
the
fundamental
demands
of
due
process
of
law
in
the
fair
administration
of
criminal
justice.
the
generalized
assertion
of
privilege
must
yield
to
the
demonstrated,
specific
need
for
the
evidence
in
a
pending
criminal
trial.
accordingly
the
judgment
under
review
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
these
cases.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
in
73-1766,
united
states
of
america
against
nixon
and
the
cross-petition,
richard
m.
nixon
against
the
united
states.
mr.
jaworski,
there
has
been
a
request
for
additional
time.
the
court
then
set
additional
time
of
one-and-a
half
hours,
i
understand.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it’ll
be
allowed
to
each
side
and
we
will
not
interrupt
the
argument
with
any
recess.
we’ll
go
right
through
until
you’re
finished.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready,
mr.
jaworski.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
do
not
suggest
that
that’s
all
you
need
to
show.
is
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
submitting
himself
to
the
judicial
process
in
the
same
sense
that
you
are,
is
that
not
so,
mr.
jaworski?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
take
one
position
and
he
takes
another.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
this
matter
may
be
one
of
semantics.
each
of
you
is
taking
a
different
position
on
the
basic
question
and
each
of
you
is
submitting
for
decision
to
this
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perhaps
it
would
further
narrow
the
area
if,
as
i
take
it
from
your
briefs,
you
do
emphasize
there
is
no
claim
here
of
typical
military
secrets
or
diplomatic
secrets
or
what,
in
the
burr
case,
were
referred
to
as
state
secretes.
none
of
those
things
are
in
this
case.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
he
filed
any
brief
or
made
an
appearance
at
all
in
any
sense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
sawyer
against
rose
i
thought
we
held
that
there
is
a
common
law
privilege
in
the
executives
dealing
at
the
state
level,
but
that
it
is
a
qualified
privilege,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
“has
taken
a
good
close
look,”
without
looking
at
the
evidence
sometimes
has
taken
a
good
close
look
at
the
claim
and
the
basis
of
the
claim.
is
that
what
you
mean?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
is
that
the
issue,
mr.
jaworski,
or
is
the
issue
whether
there
could
be
a
collateral
attack?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
brady
question
really
lurks
just
in
the
background,
does
it
not?
that
is,
if
you
get
information,
whatever
you
get
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
concede
is
available
to
any
defendant
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
who
can
make
the
showing.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
st.
clair.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
now
talking
about
the
bypassing
of
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
we
dismiss
this
appeal
as
improvidently
granted,
it
would
go
back
to
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
not
sure,
perhaps
you
can
help
me.
are
you
suggesting
that
there
was
some
duty
on
the
part
of
the
special
prosecutor
to
disclose
to
the
district
judge
that
there
was
this
secret
indictment
before
the
judge
passed
on
whether
the
material
should
be
sent
to
the
house?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
does
not
the
special
prosecutor
claim
that
the
subject
matter
is
the
same?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
st.
clair,
going
back
to
this
murder
witness
situation.
if
the
president,
any
president,
witnessed
an
automobile
accident
and
was
the
sole
witness
of
murder,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggested,
you’re
not
indicating
that
his
testimony,
his
evidence,
would
not
be
available
to
the
court
but
merely
that
he
can’t
be
subpoenaed
but
might
give
it
back
by
deposition
as
several
presidents
have
in
the
past.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
testimony
of
the
justices
of
this
court
has
been
given
in
past
times
by
depositions,
has
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
st.
clair,
you
left
me
in
a
little
bit
of
doubt
about
this
mechanical
problem.
i
think,
perhaps,
we
diverted
you
from
it.
are
you
suggesting
that
on
a
given
tape,
which
is
a
real
type
of
thing
having
an
hour
or
more
of
material
and
maybe
several
hours
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
two
or
three
days?
i
see.
that
the
first
three
hours
might
be
the
material
which
has
already
been
transcribed
and
released,
the
next
three
or
four
hours
might
be
a
conference
with
the
joint
chief
of
staff
or
the
chairman
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
on
the
program
to
give
under
developed
nations,
for
example
aid
for
peaceful
uses
of
atomic
energy,
matters
totally
irrelevant
but
confidential.
is
that
your
argument?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
you
want
some
mechanism
set
u
so
that
these
things
can
be
screened
out.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
you,
at
any
time,
tendered
or
proffered
a
statement
that
a
particular
tape
from
18
minutes
after
11
until
3:00
that
afternoon,
including
the
lunch
hour,
included
a
conference
with
the
secretary
of
state,
the
secretary
of
defense,
and
someone
else
having
to
do
with
totally
unrelated
matters,
has
that
kind
of
a
tender
been
made?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
no
explanation
of
why
it’s
left
out.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
particular
reason
why
at
least
the
identity
of
the
coquetries
could
not
be
made
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
it
were
not
so,
you
would
not
be
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
very
fact
that
the
delegation
to
mr.
jaworski
gave
him
the
right
to
contest
the
president’s
claim
of
privilege
presupposes
that
the
president
had
a
right
to
assert
the
privilege
but
not
the
right
to
assert
it
necessarily
with
complete
finality.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
what
we’re
really
arguing
about
here
today,
isn’t?
now
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
st.
clair.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
reference
to
your
point
about
whether
there
are
three
branches
or
three-and-some
fraction,
is
not
the
controller
general
something
of
an
autonomous
fractional
more
than
a-third
branch
figure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he’s
a
creature
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
he
may
proceed
but
not
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
may
proceed
with
reference
to
the
executive
branch
and,
i
would
assume,
with
reference
to
expenditures
of
the
legislative
branch
and
without
consulting
either
one
of
them.
is
that
not
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
jaworski,
as
i
understand
it,
is
claiming
that
he’s
somewhat
like,
not
necessarily
precisely
like
but
somewhat
like
the
controller
general.
that,
he
may
make
decisions
and
that
congress
cannot
recall
him
short
as,
i
believe,
a
15-year
term
for
the
controller
general
and
no
president
can
fire
the
controller
general.
and,
i
suppose,
the
court
could
not
fire
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
st.
clair,
you
have
not
mentioned
in
your
argument
a
few
moments
ago
on
the
question
of
the
absence
of
any
provision
for
immunity
for
judges
or
presidents,
you
haven’t
mentioned
the
holding
of
this
court
in
pierson
against
raid
whereas,
i
recall
it,
the
court
assumed
with
the
sentence
or
two
that
there
was
absolute
privilege
for
the
judiciary
but
that
the
privileges
of
the
executive,
in
that
case
a
policeman,
was
qualified.
the
court
had
no
difficulty
in
concluding
that
it
did
not
require
an
express
constitutional
provision
to
spell
out
an
absolute
privilege
for
judges.
these
were
state
judges
in
that
case
of
course.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
st.
clair,
you’re
cutting
into
your
rebuttal
time
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lacovara.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
laco—
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
lacovara,
i
wanted
to
get
to
this
mechanical
question
that
mr.
st.
clair
brought
up.
assume
for
the
moment
that
a
given
tape,
one
of
the
46
is
it
that
you’re
asking
for?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
64,
i
hadn’t
transposed.
one
of
the
64
tapes
is,
in
fact,
one-eighth
of
the
total
time,
which
might
be
several
hours
apparently
because
they’re
long
tapes
but,
one-eighth
involves
discussions
of
the
people
who
are
indictment
here.
but
the
seven-eighths
of
it
in
fact,
now
you
have
to
assume
this,
includes
conferences
with
the
secretaries
of
the
cabinet,
the
joint
chiefs
of
staffs,
the
chairman
of
the
atomic
energy
commission,
very
high-level
people
and
perhaps
some
staff
people
as
well.
including
in
those
conversations
some

we
granted
certiorari
before
judgment
in
these
cases
to
review
certain
pre-trial
orders
of
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
mitchell
and
others.
in
that
case,
several
former
aides
of
the
president
were
indicted
by
a
federal
grand
jury
for
crimes
including
conspiracy
to
obstruct
justice.
prosecution
for
the
government
was
commenced
by
a
special
prosecutor
who
had
been
appointed
by
the
attorney
general
pursuing
to
federal
regulation.
the
special
prosecutor
had
been
given
broad
authority.
he
moved
for
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
to
secure
from
the
president
as
a
third-party
certain
6
specifically
described
material,
chiefly
records
of
various
conversations
between
the
president
and
others
including
named
defendants
in
pending
cases.
the
district
court
authorized
the
subpoena
pursuant
to
rule
17
(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
counsel
for
the
president
moved
to
quash
the
subpoena
on
the
grounds
first
that
the
court
lack
jurisdiction
of
the
case
and
second
that
the
courts
did
not
have
the
power
to
review
the
claim
of
executive
privilege
as
asserted
here.
the
district
court,
after
hearing,
denied
the
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena.
the
president
appealed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
on
the
same
day
the
special
prosecutor
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
before
a
judgment
in
this
court.
the
grand
jury
which
had
issued
the
indictment
in
united
states
against
mitchell
and
others
had
also
named
the
president
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator.
shortly
after
the
special
prosecutor
had
filed
his
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court,
counsel
for
the
president
filed
a
cross-petition
for
certiorari
before
a
judgment
also
challenging
the
action
of
the
grand
jury
as
improper
and
as
being
unsupported
by
the
evidence.
we
granted
both
petitions
for
certiorari,
expedited
the
consideration,
and
heard
arguments
on
july
8.
at
the
outset
we
should
say
that
we
conclude
that
the
cross-petition
raises
an
issue
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
decide
in
order
to
resolve
the
issues
of
this
case
and
the
cross-petition
is
therefore,
dismissed
as
having
been
improvidently
granted.
the
president
is
not
a
party
to
the
proceedings
for
which
the
evidence
has
sought.
he
is
a
third-party
who
has,
in
his
possession
or
under
his
control,
material
the
special
prosecutor
claims
he
needs
to
proceed
with
the
cases
now
pending
in
the
district
court.
the
special
prosecutor
made
a
preliminary
showing
to
the
district
court
satisfying
that
court
that
the
evidence
he
wanted
was
probably
relevant
to
these
cases
and
probably
would
be
admissible.
the
special
prosecutor
was
able
to
describe
what
he
wanted
in
the
subpoena
duces
tecum,
because
the
daily
logs
and
diaries
which
are
routinely
kept
in
the
white
house
were
supplied
to
him.
the
special
prosecutor’s
petition
to
this
court,
advised
that
the
case
for
which
the
evidence
was
sought
would
be
tried
in
the
district
court
early
in
september
and
that
he
needed
time
to
analyze
the
large
amount
of
material
involved.
the
first
question
that
we
decided
is
whether
we
have
jurisdiction
to
review
the
district
court’s
order
denying
the
motion
to
quash
the
subpoena.
if
it
was
a
final
order,
it
would
be
an
appealable
order.
ordinarily,
an
order
of
this
kind
is
not
regarded
as
final
and,
therefore,
not
appealable.
and
the
party
is
not
permitted
to
challenge
it
in
an
appellate
court
until
it
has
becomes
certain
that
the
district
court
will,
in
fact,
command
compliance
on
pain
of
contempt.
there
are,
however,
some
expectations
to
this,
and
this
is
one
occasion
for
such
an
exception.
to
follow
the
ordinary
procedure
in
this
case,
would
very
likely
produce
more
delay
and
defeat
the
very
purpose
of
the
rule
that
only
final
orders
are
appealable.
for
this
and
other
reasons
we,
therefore,
conclude
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction.
the
president’s
counsel
contends
in
this
case
that
it
presents
a
dispute
between
the
special
prosecutor
and
the
president
and
that
since
both
are
part
of
the
executive
branch,
it
is
an
intra-branch,
a
jurisdictional
dispute
which
can
be
resolved
only
within
the
executive
branch
and
not
in
the
courts.
however,
the
special
prosecutor
in
this
case
is
not
an
ordinary
subordinate
officer
of
the
attorney
general,
because,
by
regulation
of
the
attorney
general,
the
special
prosecutor
was
given
unique
authority
and
tenure
concerning
specific
investigations
and
prosecutions.
his
authority
is
to
represent
the
united
states
as
a
sovereign
and
it
did
include
expressed
authority
to
contest
any
privilege
asserted
by
the
executive
branch.
it
is
now
well
established
that
when
the
government
or
its
department
promulgate
regulations,
the
government
is
bound
by
those
regulations
even
though
they
may
be
revoked
or
modified.
but
until
they
are
revoked
or
until
they
are
modified,
they
have
the
force
of
law.
we,
therefore,
have
before
the
court,
a
claim
by
the
special
prosecutor
vigorously
contested
by
the
president’s
counsel
on
constitutional
ground
and
we
hold
that
this
presents
a
controversy
of
the
kind
that,
as
we
said
in
baker
against
carr
that
provides
that
concrete
adverseness
which
sharpens
the
presentation
of
issues
upon
which
the
court
so
largely
depends
for
the
illumination
of
difficult
constitutional
issues.
ordinarily,
as
we
have
indicated,
a
dispute
between
two
officers
of
the
executive
branch
is
not
a
subject
to
be
settled
but
litigation
in
the
courts.
but
this
case
presents
one
of
the
unusual
exceptions
and
we,
therefore,
find
no
barrier
to
justiciability.
if
we
were
to
decide
that
the
subpoena
duces
tecum
was
not
properly
issued
in
the
first
place,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter
and
no
other
issues
would
call
for
resolution
by
this
court.
however,
from
our
examination
of
the
materials
submitted
by
the
special
prosecutor
and
supported
his
motion
for
the
subpoena,
we
are
satisfied
that
the
district
court
acted
within
its
powers
under
rule
17
(c)
for
the
production
of
the
evidence
before
trial.
in
the
performance
of
assigned
constitutional
duties
each
branch
of
the
government
must
initially
interpret
the
constitution,
and
the
interpretation
of
its
powers
by
any
one
branch
is
due
great
respect
from
the
others.
the
president’s
counsel
reads
the
constitution
as
providing
an
absolute
privilege
of
confidentiality
for
all
presidential
communications.
many
decisions
of
this
court,
however,
have
unequivocally
reaffirmed
the
holding
of
marbury
against
madison
in
1803
that
it
is
emphatically
the
province
and
duty
of
the
judicial
department
to
say
what
the
law
is.
our
system
of
government
requires
that
federal
courts
on
occasion
interpret
the
constitution
in
a
manner
at
variance
with
the
construction
given
to
that
document
by
another
branch.
any
other
inclusion
would
be
contrary
to
the
basic
concept
of
separation
of
powers
and
the
checks
and
balances
that
flow
from
the
scheme
of
a
tripartite
government.
we
therefore
reaffirm
what
was
said
in
marbury
against
madison
that
it
is
emphatically
the
province
and
duty
of
this
court
to
say
what
the
law
is
with
respect
to
a
claim
of
privilege,
such
as
presented
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
very
novel
about
a
claim
of
governmental
privilege
asserted
in
litigation
in
federal
courts.
for
example,
in
the
waterman
steamship
case
in
1948,
a
case
that
dealt
with
the
president’s
power
relating
to
foreign
airlines
where
a
decision
of
the
president
had
to
be
made
in
camera
on
confidential
reports
and
studies
relating
to
foreign
relations,
the
court
sustained
the
privilege
of
the
president.
in
united
states
against
reynolds
in
1952,
claims
were
made
against
the
united
states
for
the
death
of
various
persons
and
the
injury
of
others
in
the
crash
of
an
experimental
airplane,
which
was
being
tested
for
military
usage.
there,
the
government’s
claim
was
based
on
the
secrecy
of
these
very
confidential
and
secret
military
instruments.
in
each
case,
waterman
and
reynolds,
the
claim
of
privilege
was
upheld
by
the
courts.
however,
there
are
important
differences
and
only
a
few
of
them
need
to
be
mentioned
here
today.
first,
the
waterman
steamship
and
reynolds
case
were
not
criminal
cases
and
the
government
was
not
in
the
posture
of
a
third-party
in
possession
of
relevant
evidence.
moreover,
those
cases,
as
i
have
noted,
involved
confidential
military
and
diplomatic
information,
but
here
the
claim
of
privilege
rests
simply
on
the
generalized
undifferentiated
claim
of
the
need
to
keep
all
the
presidential
communications
private
and
confidential.
we
had
once
recognized
the
high
difference
that
is
due
to
protect
all
of
the
communications
of
the
president.
as
early
as
the
case
of
united
states
against
burr,
1807,
chief
justice
marshall
sitting
as
a
trial
judge
had
authorised
to
subpoena
to
president
jefferson
to
secure
certain
letters
in
the
possession
of
the
president.
and
marshall
noted,
among
many
other
important
passages
in
that
opinion
that
in
no
case
of
this
kind
would
a
court
be
required
to
proceed
against
the
president
as
against
an
ordinary
individual.
however,
the
deference,
traditionally
shown
by
the
courts
toward
a
president,
does
not
mean
that
all
material
in
the
possession
of
a
president
is
immune
in
all
circumstances
from
judicial
process.
we
recognize
the
importance
of
the
need
to
protect
the
confidentiality
of
the
communication
of
a
president
with
his
aides
and
advisors
and
we
recognize
the
risk
that
publication
of
those
communications
may
well
have
an
adverse
effect
on
the
ability
of
a
president
to
secure
candid
advice
and
the
proposing
views
on
important
questions.
however,
no
case
of
this
court
has
extended
this
high
degree
of
deference
to
a
president’s
generalized
need
of
confidentiality.
nowhere
in
the
constitution
is
there
any
explicit
reference
to
the
privilege
of
confidentiality.
yet
to
the
extent
this
interest
relates
to
the
effective
discharge
of
a
president’s
powers,
it
is
constitutionally
based.
in
this
case
we
must
weigh
the
importance
of
the
general
privilege
of
confidentiality
of
presidential
communications
in
the
performance
of
his
responsibilities
against
the
inroads
of
such
a
privilege
on
the
fair
administration
of
criminal
justice.
although
the
interest
in
preserving
confidentiality
is,
as
we
have
noted,
very
weighty
indeed
and
entitled
to
great
respect,
we
cannot
conclude
that
advisors
will
be
moved
to
temper
the
candor
of
their
remarks
by
the
infrequent
occasions
of
disclosure
that
maybe
brought
about
because
of
the
possibility
that
such
conversations
will
be
called
for
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
prosecution.
on
the
other
hand,
the
allowance
of
the
privilege
to
withhold
evidence
that
is
demonstrably
relevant
in
a
criminal
trial
would
cut
deeply
into
the
guarantee
of
due
process
of
law
and
gravely
impair
the
basic
function
of
the
courts
under
article
iii.
a
president’s
acknowledged
need
for
confidentiality
in
the
communications
of
his
office
is
general
in
nature,
whereas
the
constitutional
need
for
production
of
relevant
evidence
in
a
criminal
proceeding
is
specific
and
central
to
the
fair
adjudication
of
a
particular
criminal
case
in
the
administration
of
justice.
without
access
to
specific
facts
a
criminal
prosecution
may
be
totally
frustrated.
the
president’s
broad
interest
in
confidentiality
of
communications
will
not,
in
our
view,
vitiated
by
disclosure
of
a
limited
number
of
conversations
which
have
preliminarily
been
shown
to
have
some
bearing
on
a
pending
criminal
case.
we
conclude,
therefore,
that
when
the
ground
for
asserting
of
the
privilege
as
to
subpoenaed
materials,
sought
for
use
in
a
criminal
trial,
is
based
solely
on
the
generalized
interest
in
confidentiality
as
distinguished
from
the
situations
whereat
maybe
based
upon
military
secret
or
diplomatic
secrets,
it
cannot
prevail
over
the
fundamental
demands
of
due
process
of
law
in
the
fair
administration
of
criminal
justice.
the
generalized
assertion
of
privilege
must
yield
to
the
demonstrated,
specific
need
for
the
evidence
in
a
pending
criminal
trial.
accordingly
the
judgment
under
review
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
these
cases.
