justice
potter
stewart
you’d
still
be
here,
mr.
jaworski,
whether
or
not
the
president
had
been
named
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator
but
that
simply
gives
you
another
string
to
your
bow.
isn’t
that
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
but
even
had
the
president
not
been
named,
you
would
still
have
subpoena
at
least
part
of
this
material.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you’d
still
be
here.
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
in
a
mandamus
action,
judge
sirica
would
be
the
party
respondent
and
he’s
not
a
party
in
this
case
and
he’s
not
represented
by
counsel
here,
is
he?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
mandamus
would
be
nixon
versus
sirica,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
except,
i
would
suggest
again
that,
with
respect
to
the
mandamus
action,
one
of
the
parties
isn’t
here
in
court
or
presented
by
counsel.
he
is
the
party
respondent.
justice
potter
stewart
who
represents
him
here?
justice
potter
stewart
nixon
versus
sirica
was
different,
in
that,
the
parties
there
where
the
grand
jury,
on
the
one
hand,
represented
to
be
sure
by
the
special
prosecutor.
but
the
grand
jury,
which
is
an
adjunct
of
the
judicial
branch
of
government
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
chief
executive
on
the
other.
and
here,
now
that
an
indictment
has
been
returned,
the
two
parties
are
both
members
of
the
executive
branch.
isn’t
that
correct
that
there
is
that
difference?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
you
are
a
member.
you’re
united
states
and
the
people
of
united
states,
whom
you
represent.
you
are
not
a
member
of
the
judicial
branch
unlike
the
grand
jury
in
nixon
against
sirica.
you’re
a
member
of
the
executive
branch
of
government,
are
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
that
difference.
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
be
a
crucial
difference,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
you’re,
if
anything,
more
independent
than
mr.
cox
was
under
the
regulation.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
doesn’t
really
go
to
the
question
that
i
raised.
justice
potter
stewart
you’re
quoting
from
whom
and
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
what
occasion?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you,
now,
arguing
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
executive
privilege.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn’t
think
so.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think,
if
anything,
it’s
a
common
law
privilege?
is
that
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
(inaudible)
chemical
corporation
who
supported
the
claims.
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
great
review.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except,
part
of
the
grounds
on
which
you
rest
in
subpoenaing
this
material
is
the
fact
that
the
president
has
himself
been
named
as
a
co-conspirator,
an
unindicted
one.
and,
that’s
true,
isn’t
it?
that’s
a
part
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
these
two
grounds
upon
which
you
rest
in
subpoenaing
this
material.
and,
the
response
to
that
is,
the
president
cannot
constitutionally
be
named
as
an
unidicted
co-conspirator.
so,
to
that
extent,
it’s
in
this
case.
the
question’s
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
something
quite
different
again,
whether
or
not
there
was
sufficient
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
to
justify
the
grand
jury
in
naming
the
president.
that’s
quite
a
different
and,
as
chief
justice
suggested,
a
collateral
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
president
can
constitutionally
be
named
by
a
grand
jury
as
a
co-conspirator,
even
though
an
unindicted
one,
it
is
at
least
tangentially
before
us
because
that’s
--
it’s
the
fact
that
he’s
part
of
the
rounds
and
part
of
the
foundation
upon
which
you
have
based
your
subpoena
duces
tecum.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
defendants,
under
the
brady
doctrine,
are
entitled
to
subpoenaing
information.
and
material
that’s
not
now
in
your
possession,
but
is
in
the
possession
of
the
president,
was
an
issue
that
was
left
undecided
by
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
are
they
in
the
record,
not
what
he’s
mentioned.
justice
potter
stewart
the
case
would
be
on
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals
if
we
dismissed
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that,
as
i
understand
it,
was
not
among
the
material
that
was
conveyed
to
the
grand
jury.
there
seems
to
be,
if
i’m
--
at
least
that’s
what
i
understood
mr.
jaworski
to
tell
us
this
morning.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
just
a
moment.
i
understood
mr.
jaworski
to
tell
us
this
morning,
very
unambiguously
and
explicitly,
that
the
fact
that
the
president
was
named
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator
was
not
conveyed
to
the
grand
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
released,
i
think,
to
the
house
of
representatives.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought—
justice
potter
stewart
exactly,
and
that’s
what
mr.
jaworski
has
represented
again
to
us
this
morning,
was
the
fact
of
the
matter.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
followed
in
what
form?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
it
wasn’t
sent
from
the
court
over
to
the
house,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
how
far
does
your
point
go?
let’s
assume
that
a
murder
took
place
on
the
streets
of
washington
of
which
the
president
happen
to
be
one
of
the
very
few
eyewitnesses,
and
somebody
was
indicted
for
that
murder
and
the
president
was
subpoenaed
as
a
witness.
would
you
say
he
cannot
be
subpoenaed
now
because
there
is
an
impeachment
inquiry
going
on
and
the
courts
absolutely
have
to
stop
dead
on
their
tracks
of
doing
their
ordinary
judicial
business?
justice
potter
stewart
setting
that
to
one
side.
justice
potter
stewart
you’re
saying
that
the
courts,
as
i
understand
it,
have
to
stop
dead
in
their
tracks
from
doing
their
ordinary
business
in
any
matter
involving
even,
tangentially,
the
president
of
the
united
states
if
or
as
of
when
the
committee
of
the
house
of
representative
is
investigating
impeachment.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
here
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
seven
people
have
been
indicted.
six
of
whom
remain
under
indictment.
justice
potter
stewart
the
trial
is
scheduled
for
next
september
9.
justice
potter
stewart
the
prosecutor
is
preparing
for
that
trial.
he
is
trying
to,
under
rule
17
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
to
adduce
matters
to
be
used
in
evidence
at
that
trial.
you
say
that
cannot
go
forward
because
of
some
tangential
effect
or,
you
say,
direct
effect
upon
some
other
matter
going
out
in
another
branch
of
the
government.
and
how
far
does
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
not
decided
by
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
you
filed
a
motion
to
quash
it,
didn’t
you?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
why
wouldn’t
this
case
be
here
if
this
were
a
united
states
attorney?
i
think
i
agree
with
you,
but
i’d
like
to
ask
you
your
answer
in
knowing
why.
justice
potter
stewart
by
whom?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
attorney
general
was
the
one
who
directed
the
united
states
attorney.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
in
the
normal
case,
the
president
doesn’t
know
anything
about
mine-run
federal
prosecutions.
that’s
fair
to
say,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
in
fact,
in
mine-run
cases
the
attorney
general
doesn’t
know
much
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
let’s
--
just
a
moment.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
right.[laughter]
so,
the
united
states
attorney
brings
to
prosecution
and
in
the
course
of
that
prosecution
he,
before
trial,
subpoenas
under
rule
17
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
the
jury
subpoenas
material
in
the
custody
of
the
president.
so,
what
happens?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it’s
the
united
states
attorney
subpoenaing
it
under
your
hypothetical
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so,
what
happens?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
united
states
attorney
says
“i’m
not
going
to
do
that
because
i’m
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
one
who
upholds
justice
and—[laughter]
well,
how
would
you
have
a
new
united
states
attorney?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i’m
being
serious
because
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it’s
set
by
statute.
it’s
vested
in
the
law
enforcement.
it’s
vested
in
the
attorney
general.
justice
potter
stewart
yes?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
i’m
afraid,
your
argument
would
be
--
isn’t
very
good
as
a
matter
of
political
science.
it
would
be
a
very
fine
one
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
and
probably
statutory
law,
except
it
hasn’t.
your
client
dealt
himself
out
of
that
argument
by
what’s
been
done
in
the
creation
of
the
special
prosecutor.
justice
potter
stewart
you’ve
just
pointed
out
the
special
prosecutor
is
quite
different
from
the
united
states
attorney.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
has
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
he
didn’t
what?
he
could
not
and
probably
could
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
know,
not
the
unfettered
right
to
get
it
but
the
right
to
go
to
court
and
ask
a
court
to
decide
whether
or
not
he’s
entitled
to
it.
justice
potter
stewart
you’re
making
those
defenses
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
we
don’t
know
that.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
--
and
if
surely
you’re
right,
as
i
say,
a
lawsuit
between
the
secretary
of
commerce,
for
example,
suing
the
president
over
a
matter
of
executive
policy,
we
both
agree,
would
be
unthinkable.
and
since
any
cabinet
officer
is
the
creature
of
the
president
who
appointed
him,
the
answer
would
be
“you’re
fired,”
if
you
want
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
goes
that
far.
justice
potter
stewart
but
aren’t
we
here
both
factually
and,
i
suggest,
legally
with
quite
a
different
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
sovereign
people
of
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
but
hasn’t
your
client
also
inhibited
himself
from
the
ultimate
sanction
that
you
suggested
he
could
impose
with
respect
to
your
hypothetical
united
states
attorney,
i.e.
the
sanction
of
dismissing
the
special
prosecutor.
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
regulations
that
have
the
force
of
law.
justice
potter
stewart
and
until
or
unless
he
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
have
a
case
of
controversy
of
a
very
real
kind.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
he
hasn’t.
justice
potter
stewart
you’re
a
living
testimony
of
the
fact
that
he
did
not
give
up
his
right
to
defend
his
position
in
court.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you’re
now
dealing,
as
i
understand
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
st.
clair
with
the
jurisdictional
question
and,
as
i
further
understand
it,
that
that
argument
of
yours,
at
least
i
got
it
from
the
brief,
involves
at
least
two
separate
concepts
and
maybe
three.
one
is
that
this
is
an
intra-branch
dispute,
and
that
argument
would
be
fully
valid
under
the
analogy
you
use
in
your
brief.
if
this
were
a
dispute
between,
let’s
say,
two
committees
in
one
of
the
houses
of
the
congress
and
one
committee
sued
the
other
for
jurisdiction
of
a
particular
matter,
you
suggest
and
probably
quite
correctly,
that
that
would
not
be
a
matter
for
the
judiciary
to
determine.
that’s
one
argument.
that
this
is
purely
an
intra-executive
branch
controversy,
as
it
would
be
between
two
congressional
committees.
this
is
intra-article
2
branch.
the
hypothetical
case
would
be
intra-article
1
branch.
and
then,
you
have
quite
a
separate
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
i.e.
that
the
president
constitutionally
is
the
chief
prosecutor
since
he
is
the
executive.
and,
it
is
not
for
the
courts
to
decide
what
a
prosecutor
shall
use
in
prosecuting
a
criminal
case.
now,
isn’t
that
--
aren’t
those
two
separate
arguments?
you
make
both
of
them
under
this
rule
brick.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
seems
to
me
they’re
quite
separate.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
second
argument
will
have
no
relevance
at
all
to
your
analogy
of
the
legislative
branch.
justice
potter
stewart
but
ultimately,
you
tell
us
that,
constitutionally,
the
president
as
chief
executive
and,
therefore,
as
constitutionally
the
chief
prosecutor
or
whatever
the
statutes
might
provide
--
justice
potter
stewart
has
unrestricted
discretion
to
determine
what
evidence
he
will
or
will
not
use
in
prosecuting
a
case.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
quite
a
different
concept
from
the
other
concept.
you
make
them
both
under
the
same
rule
brick,
as
i
say.
but
i
--
it
seems
to
me,
they’re
quite
separate
arguments.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
you
do
or
you
wouldn’t
make
them.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
st.
clair,
if
i
may
interrupt
you
again.
is
this
--
is
what
you’re
telling
us
now
directed
to
your
point
that
this
is
a
non-justiciable
political
question
or
is
it
directed
to
your
point
that
executive
privilege
is
absolute
and
that
the
determination
of
it
is
to
be
made
public?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let’s
assume
we
accept
that
proposition.
what
follows
from
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
should
think
you
could
run
the
argument
the
other
way
saying
that
since
the
president
cannot
be
indicted
then
all
that
can
happen
to
him
is
that
he
can
be
named
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator.
justice
potter
stewart
or
a
vice
president.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
pretty
far-field
from
the
basic
question
here,
which
is
the
testimonial
privilege.
justice
potter
stewart
not
prosecutorial
immunity,
but
testimonial
privileges
are
what
we’re
dealing
with
here
basically.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
your
argument.
but
this
matter
--
justice
potter
stewart
whether
or
not
they
can
--
a
judge
can
be
prosecuted
criminally
or
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
testimonial
privilege,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
since
i
have
already
interrupted
you,
may
i?
justice
potter
stewart
to
rail
upon
your
good
nature
a
little
more
mr.
st.
clair,
to
ask
you
whether
it
is
your
claim
that
any
of
these
materials
have
to
do
with
what
have
sometimes
been
called
matters
of
state,
i.e.
matters
of
international
relations
or
national
defense.
mr.
jaworski
assure
to
us
that
they
did
not
involve
matters
of
state,
but
i’m
about
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
about
that,
because
as
you
well
know
both
the
commentators
and
court
decisions
have
made
a
dichotomy
between
the
privilege
that
exist
with
respect
to
ordinary
general
confidentiality
on
one
hand
of
the
executive,
and
matters
of
state
on
the
other
to
which
a
higher
privilege
has
sometimes
been
thought
to
be
accorded.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
this
tape
--
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
correct
in
believing,
mr.
st.
clair,
in
understanding,
mr.
st.
clair,
that
in
this
case
to
date
no
representation
has
been
made
by
affidavit
or
professional
representation
or
otherwise
that
any
of
these
materials
have
to
do
with
national
defense
or
international
relations?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
would
be,
therefore,
a
matter
to
be
under
the
existing
order
now
under
review
of
judge
sirica.
that
would
be
submitted
to
him
later
in
camera,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
i
say
under
his
existing
order.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
what
you’re
telling
us
also
could
be
argued
the
other
way,
that
there
has
been
a
waiver
and
neither
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
brother
has
talked
about
waiver.
i
don’t
know
what
he
suggested.
justice
potter
stewart
the
fact
that
i’d
like
to
ask
before
you
get
too
far,
let’s
assume
you
get
by
the
jurisdictional
matters
and
also
the
standing
question,
the
intra-executive
dispute
matter,
and
we
get
to
the
executive
privilege
or
we
get
to
the
merits,
so-called.
justice
potter
stewart
which
into
this
case
would
we
normally
start
at
anyway,
the
17c
end
or
the
executive
privilege
end?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
iozia
just
means
only
evidentiary
and
relevant.
is
that
what
you
--
is
that
your
reading?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
don’t
think
iozia
and
bowman
requires
any
showing
that
this
particular
evidence
be
something
more
than
evidentiary
and
relevant?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
you
apparently
concede
that
you
can’t
use
it
just
for
discovery.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
the
evidence
you’re
seeking
by
a
subpoena,
you
must
make
some
kind
of
a
minimal
showing
of
admissibility.
you
can’t,
for
example,
seek
something
that
would
admittedly
be
an
admissible
hearsay.
justice
potter
stewart
one
of
your
grounds
for
the
non-applicability
of
the
privilege
is
that
these
conversations
were
in
the
course
of
the
conspirators.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that,
you
say,
is
satisfied
by
merely
the
grand
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
just
a
moment.
justice
potter
stewart
it
isn’t
satisfied
merely
by
the
grand
jury
finding
so
a
court
must
go
on
and
make
it
so
a
determination
if
they
were
going
to
agree
with
you
on
this
ground.
justice
potter
stewart
that
showing
or
such
a
showing
could
arguably
have
been
made
whether
or
not
the
grand
jury
had
named
the
president,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
you’d
still
be
here,
mr.
jaworski,
whether
or
not
the
president
had
been
named
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator
but
that
simply
gives
you
another
string
to
your
bow.
isn’t
that
about
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
but
even
had
the
president
not
been
named,
you
would
still
have
subpoena
at
least
part
of
this
material.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you’d
still
be
here.
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
in
a
mandamus
action,
judge
sirica
would
be
the
party
respondent
and
he’s
not
a
party
in
this
case
and
he’s
not
represented
by
counsel
here,
is
he?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
mandamus
would
be
nixon
versus
sirica,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
except,
i
would
suggest
again
that,
with
respect
to
the
mandamus
action,
one
of
the
parties
isn’t
here
in
court
or
presented
by
counsel.
he
is
the
party
respondent.
justice
potter
stewart
who
represents
him
here?
justice
potter
stewart
nixon
versus
sirica
was
different,
in
that,
the
parties
there
where
the
grand
jury,
on
the
one
hand,
represented
to
be
sure
by
the
special
prosecutor.
but
the
grand
jury,
which
is
an
adjunct
of
the
judicial
branch
of
government
on
the
one
hand,
and
the
chief
executive
on
the
other.
and
here,
now
that
an
indictment
has
been
returned,
the
two
parties
are
both
members
of
the
executive
branch.
isn’t
that
correct
that
there
is
that
difference?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
you
are
a
member.
you’re
united
states
and
the
people
of
united
states,
whom
you
represent.
you
are
not
a
member
of
the
judicial
branch
unlike
the
grand
jury
in
nixon
against
sirica.
you’re
a
member
of
the
executive
branch
of
government,
are
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
there
is
that
difference.
justice
potter
stewart
it
might
be
a
crucial
difference,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
you’re,
if
anything,
more
independent
than
mr.
cox
was
under
the
regulation.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
doesn’t
really
go
to
the
question
that
i
raised.
justice
potter
stewart
you’re
quoting
from
whom
and
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
in
what
occasion?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you,
now,
arguing
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
executive
privilege.
justice
potter
stewart
i
didn’t
think
so.
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think,
if
anything,
it’s
a
common
law
privilege?
is
that
your
point?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
(inaudible)
chemical
corporation
who
supported
the
claims.
justice
potter
stewart
in
that
great
review.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except,
part
of
the
grounds
on
which
you
rest
in
subpoenaing
this
material
is
the
fact
that
the
president
has
himself
been
named
as
a
co-conspirator,
an
unindicted
one.
and,
that’s
true,
isn’t
it?
that’s
a
part
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
these
two
grounds
upon
which
you
rest
in
subpoenaing
this
material.
and,
the
response
to
that
is,
the
president
cannot
constitutionally
be
named
as
an
unidicted
co-conspirator.
so,
to
that
extent,
it’s
in
this
case.
the
question’s
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
something
quite
different
again,
whether
or
not
there
was
sufficient
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
to
justify
the
grand
jury
in
naming
the
president.
that’s
quite
a
different
and,
as
chief
justice
suggested,
a
collateral
issue.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
president
can
constitutionally
be
named
by
a
grand
jury
as
a
co-conspirator,
even
though
an
unindicted
one,
it
is
at
least
tangentially
before
us
because
that’s
--
it’s
the
fact
that
he’s
part
of
the
rounds
and
part
of
the
foundation
upon
which
you
have
based
your
subpoena
duces
tecum.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
defendants,
under
the
brady
doctrine,
are
entitled
to
subpoenaing
information.
and
material
that’s
not
now
in
your
possession,
but
is
in
the
possession
of
the
president,
was
an
issue
that
was
left
undecided
by
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
right
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
are
they
in
the
record,
not
what
he’s
mentioned.
justice
potter
stewart
the
case
would
be
on
appeal
in
the
court
of
appeals
if
we
dismissed
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that,
as
i
understand
it,
was
not
among
the
material
that
was
conveyed
to
the
grand
jury.
there
seems
to
be,
if
i’m
--
at
least
that’s
what
i
understood
mr.
jaworski
to
tell
us
this
morning.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
just
a
moment.
i
understood
mr.
jaworski
to
tell
us
this
morning,
very
unambiguously
and
explicitly,
that
the
fact
that
the
president
was
named
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator
was
not
conveyed
to
the
grand
jury.
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
released,
i
think,
to
the
house
of
representatives.
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought—
justice
potter
stewart
exactly,
and
that’s
what
mr.
jaworski
has
represented
again
to
us
this
morning,
was
the
fact
of
the
matter.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
followed
in
what
form?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
it
wasn’t
sent
from
the
court
over
to
the
house,
was
it?
justice
potter
stewart
how
far
does
your
point
go?
let’s
assume
that
a
murder
took
place
on
the
streets
of
washington
of
which
the
president
happen
to
be
one
of
the
very
few
eyewitnesses,
and
somebody
was
indicted
for
that
murder
and
the
president
was
subpoenaed
as
a
witness.
would
you
say
he
cannot
be
subpoenaed
now
because
there
is
an
impeachment
inquiry
going
on
and
the
courts
absolutely
have
to
stop
dead
on
their
tracks
of
doing
their
ordinary
judicial
business?
justice
potter
stewart
setting
that
to
one
side.
justice
potter
stewart
you’re
saying
that
the
courts,
as
i
understand
it,
have
to
stop
dead
in
their
tracks
from
doing
their
ordinary
business
in
any
matter
involving
even,
tangentially,
the
president
of
the
united
states
if
or
as
of
when
the
committee
of
the
house
of
representative
is
investigating
impeachment.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
here
are
--
justice
potter
stewart
seven
people
have
been
indicted.
six
of
whom
remain
under
indictment.
justice
potter
stewart
the
trial
is
scheduled
for
next
september
9.
justice
potter
stewart
the
prosecutor
is
preparing
for
that
trial.
he
is
trying
to,
under
rule
17
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
to
adduce
matters
to
be
used
in
evidence
at
that
trial.
you
say
that
cannot
go
forward
because
of
some
tangential
effect
or,
you
say,
direct
effect
upon
some
other
matter
going
out
in
another
branch
of
the
government.
and
how
far
does
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
not
decided
by
the
district
court.
justice
potter
stewart
you
filed
a
motion
to
quash
it,
didn’t
you?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
why
wouldn’t
this
case
be
here
if
this
were
a
united
states
attorney?
i
think
i
agree
with
you,
but
i’d
like
to
ask
you
your
answer
in
knowing
why.
justice
potter
stewart
by
whom?
justice
potter
stewart
i
thought
the
attorney
general
was
the
one
who
directed
the
united
states
attorney.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
in
the
normal
case,
the
president
doesn’t
know
anything
about
mine-run
federal
prosecutions.
that’s
fair
to
say,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
in
fact,
in
mine-run
cases
the
attorney
general
doesn’t
know
much
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
but
let’s
--
just
a
moment.[laughter]
justice
potter
stewart
right.[laughter]
so,
the
united
states
attorney
brings
to
prosecution
and
in
the
course
of
that
prosecution
he,
before
trial,
subpoenas
under
rule
17
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
the
jury
subpoenas
material
in
the
custody
of
the
president.
so,
what
happens?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it’s
the
united
states
attorney
subpoenaing
it
under
your
hypothetical
case.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so,
what
happens?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
united
states
attorney
says
“i’m
not
going
to
do
that
because
i’m
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
one
who
upholds
justice
and—[laughter]
well,
how
would
you
have
a
new
united
states
attorney?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i’m
being
serious
because
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it’s
set
by
statute.
it’s
vested
in
the
law
enforcement.
it’s
vested
in
the
attorney
general.
justice
potter
stewart
yes?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
i’m
afraid,
your
argument
would
be
--
isn’t
very
good
as
a
matter
of
political
science.
it
would
be
a
very
fine
one
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
and
probably
statutory
law,
except
it
hasn’t.
your
client
dealt
himself
out
of
that
argument
by
what’s
been
done
in
the
creation
of
the
special
prosecutor.
justice
potter
stewart
you’ve
just
pointed
out
the
special
prosecutor
is
quite
different
from
the
united
states
attorney.
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
matter
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
has
--
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
he
didn’t
what?
he
could
not
and
probably
could
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
know,
not
the
unfettered
right
to
get
it
but
the
right
to
go
to
court
and
ask
a
court
to
decide
whether
or
not
he’s
entitled
to
it.
justice
potter
stewart
you’re
making
those
defenses
in
--
justice
potter
stewart
why
not?
justice
potter
stewart
we
don’t
know
that.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
--
and
if
surely
you’re
right,
as
i
say,
a
lawsuit
between
the
secretary
of
commerce,
for
example,
suing
the
president
over
a
matter
of
executive
policy,
we
both
agree,
would
be
unthinkable.
and
since
any
cabinet
officer
is
the
creature
of
the
president
who
appointed
him,
the
answer
would
be
“you’re
fired,”
if
you
want
to
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
goes
that
far.
justice
potter
stewart
but
aren’t
we
here
both
factually
and,
i
suggest,
legally
with
quite
a
different
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
sovereign
people
of
the
united
states.
justice
potter
stewart
but
hasn’t
your
client
also
inhibited
himself
from
the
ultimate
sanction
that
you
suggested
he
could
impose
with
respect
to
your
hypothetical
united
states
attorney,
i.e.
the
sanction
of
dismissing
the
special
prosecutor.
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
a
matter
of
law,
regulations
that
have
the
force
of
law.
justice
potter
stewart
and
until
or
unless
he
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
we
have
a
case
of
controversy
of
a
very
real
kind.
justice
potter
stewart
certainly,
he
hasn’t.
justice
potter
stewart
you’re
a
living
testimony
of
the
fact
that
he
did
not
give
up
his
right
to
defend
his
position
in
court.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you’re
now
dealing,
as
i
understand
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
st.
clair
with
the
jurisdictional
question
and,
as
i
further
understand
it,
that
that
argument
of
yours,
at
least
i
got
it
from
the
brief,
involves
at
least
two
separate
concepts
and
maybe
three.
one
is
that
this
is
an
intra-branch
dispute,
and
that
argument
would
be
fully
valid
under
the
analogy
you
use
in
your
brief.
if
this
were
a
dispute
between,
let’s
say,
two
committees
in
one
of
the
houses
of
the
congress
and
one
committee
sued
the
other
for
jurisdiction
of
a
particular
matter,
you
suggest
and
probably
quite
correctly,
that
that
would
not
be
a
matter
for
the
judiciary
to
determine.
that’s
one
argument.
that
this
is
purely
an
intra-executive
branch
controversy,
as
it
would
be
between
two
congressional
committees.
this
is
intra-article
2
branch.
the
hypothetical
case
would
be
intra-article
1
branch.
and
then,
you
have
quite
a
separate
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
i.e.
that
the
president
constitutionally
is
the
chief
prosecutor
since
he
is
the
executive.
and,
it
is
not
for
the
courts
to
decide
what
a
prosecutor
shall
use
in
prosecuting
a
criminal
case.
now,
isn’t
that
--
aren’t
those
two
separate
arguments?
you
make
both
of
them
under
this
rule
brick.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
seems
to
me
they’re
quite
separate.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
second
argument
will
have
no
relevance
at
all
to
your
analogy
of
the
legislative
branch.
justice
potter
stewart
but
ultimately,
you
tell
us
that,
constitutionally,
the
president
as
chief
executive
and,
therefore,
as
constitutionally
the
chief
prosecutor
or
whatever
the
statutes
might
provide
--
justice
potter
stewart
has
unrestricted
discretion
to
determine
what
evidence
he
will
or
will
not
use
in
prosecuting
a
case.
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
quite
a
different
concept
from
the
other
concept.
you
make
them
both
under
the
same
rule
brick,
as
i
say.
but
i
--
it
seems
to
me,
they’re
quite
separate
arguments.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
you
do
or
you
wouldn’t
make
them.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
st.
clair,
if
i
may
interrupt
you
again.
is
this
--
is
what
you’re
telling
us
now
directed
to
your
point
that
this
is
a
non-justiciable
political
question
or
is
it
directed
to
your
point
that
executive
privilege
is
absolute
and
that
the
determination
of
it
is
to
be
made
public?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let’s
assume
we
accept
that
proposition.
what
follows
from
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
should
think
you
could
run
the
argument
the
other
way
saying
that
since
the
president
cannot
be
indicted
then
all
that
can
happen
to
him
is
that
he
can
be
named
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator.
justice
potter
stewart
or
a
vice
president.

this
is
pretty
far-field
from
the
basic
question
here,
which
is
the
testimonial
privilege.
justice
potter
stewart
not
prosecutorial
immunity,
but
testimonial
privileges
are
what
we’re
dealing
with
here
basically.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
your
argument.
but
this
matter
--
justice
potter
stewart
whether
or
not
they
can
--
a
judge
can
be
prosecuted
criminally
or
is
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
testimonial
privilege,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that.
since
i
have
already
interrupted
you,
may
i?
justice
potter
stewart
to
rail
upon
your
good
nature
a
little
more
mr.
st.
clair,
to
ask
you
whether
it
is
your
claim
that
any
of
these
materials
have
to
do
with
what
have
sometimes
been
called
matters
of
state,
i.e.
matters
of
international
relations
or
national
defense.
mr.
jaworski
assure
to
us
that
they
did
not
involve
matters
of
state,
but
i’m
about
to
hear
what
you
have
to
say
about
that,
because
as
you
well
know
both
the
commentators
and
court
decisions
have
made
a
dichotomy
between
the
privilege
that
exist
with
respect
to
ordinary
general
confidentiality
on
one
hand
of
the
executive,
and
matters
of
state
on
the
other
to
which
a
higher
privilege
has
sometimes
been
thought
to
be
accorded.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
this
tape
--
justice
potter
stewart
am
i
correct
in
believing,
mr.
st.
clair,
in
understanding,
mr.
st.
clair,
that
in
this
case
to
date
no
representation
has
been
made
by
affidavit
or
professional
representation
or
otherwise
that
any
of
these
materials
have
to
do
with
national
defense
or
international
relations?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
would
be,
therefore,
a
matter
to
be
under
the
existing
order
now
under
review
of
judge
sirica.
that
would
be
submitted
to
him
later
in
camera,
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
i
say
under
his
existing
order.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
what
you’re
telling
us
also
could
be
argued
the
other
way,
that
there
has
been
a
waiver
and
neither
--
justice
potter
stewart
your
brother
has
talked
about
waiver.
i
don’t
know
what
he
suggested.
justice
potter
stewart
the
fact
that
i’d
like
to
ask
before
you
get
too
far,
let’s
assume
you
get
by
the
jurisdictional
matters
and
also
the
standing
question,
the
intra-executive
dispute
matter,
and
we
get
to
the
executive
privilege
or
we
get
to
the
merits,
so-called.
justice
potter
stewart
which
into
this
case
would
we
normally
start
at
anyway,
the
17c
end
or
the
executive
privilege
end?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
iozia
just
means
only
evidentiary
and
relevant.
is
that
what
you
--
is
that
your
reading?
justice
potter
stewart
so
you
don’t
think
iozia
and
bowman
requires
any
showing
that
this
particular
evidence
be
something
more
than
evidentiary
and
relevant?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
you
apparently
concede
that
you
can’t
use
it
just
for
discovery.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
the
evidence
you’re
seeking
by
a
subpoena,
you
must
make
some
kind
of
a
minimal
showing
of
admissibility.
you
can’t,
for
example,
seek
something
that
would
admittedly
be
an
admissible
hearsay.
justice
potter
stewart
one
of
your
grounds
for
the
non-applicability
of
the
privilege
is
that
these
conversations
were
in
the
course
of
the
conspirators.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that,
you
say,
is
satisfied
by
merely
the
grand
jury?
justice
potter
stewart
just
a
moment.
justice
potter
stewart
it
isn’t
satisfied
merely
by
the
grand
jury
finding
so
a
court
must
go
on
and
make
it
so
a
determination
if
they
were
going
to
agree
with
you
on
this
ground.
justice
potter
stewart
that
showing
or
such
a
showing
could
arguably
have
been
made
whether
or
not
the
grand
jury
had
named
the
president,
would
it
not?
