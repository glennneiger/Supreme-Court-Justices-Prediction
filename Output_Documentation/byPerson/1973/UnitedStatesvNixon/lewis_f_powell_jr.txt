as
i
understand
your
brief,
you
go
beyond
what
you
have
addressed
so
far.
i
think
you
say
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
president
was
named
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator
forecloses
his
claim
of
privilege.

it’s

page

of
your
brief.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

well,
that
reduces
him,
in
it
of
itself,
to
the
status
of
any
other
person
accused
of
crime.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
your
view
that
there
are
no
inferences
to
be
arrived
from
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
or
you’re
saying
this
is
purely
an
evidentiary
privilege?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
st.
clair,
may
i
get
back
to
what
seems
rather
fundamental
to
me?
let
us
assume
that
it
had
been
established
the
conversations
we
are
talking
about
here
today
did
involve
a
criminal
conspiracy.
would
you
still
be
asserting
an
absolute
privilege?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right,
and
as
i
understand
it,
the
public
interest
behind
that
privilege
is
the
preservation
of
candor
in
discussions
between
the
president
and
his
closes
did.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

may
i
follow
that
up?
justice
lewis
f.

what
public
interest
is
there
in
preserving
secrecy
with
respect
to
a
criminal
conspiracy?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
my
question
was
based
on
the
assumption
that
it
had
been
established
that
the
conversation
did
relate
to
a
criminal
conspiracy.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
no.
it
could
have
been
established
in
various
ways.
as
you’ve
just
said,
a
number
of
people
have
already
confessed
and
these
people
were
participants
in
some
of
these
conversations.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
of
course.
but
anyway,
your
answer
is
that
you
would
still
assert
the
action
through.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

mr.
lacovara.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
just
back
up
a
minute.
do
you
concede
that
an
incumbent
president
of
the
united
states
could
not
be
indicted
and
tried
for
crime?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
do
not.
do
you
think
he
could
be?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let’s
assume
for
the
moment
that
he
could
not
be,
would
you
still
argue
that
the
grand
jury
had
the
power
or
the
right
and,
if
so,
by
virtue
of
what?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
to
name
him
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
thing
that
i
was
wondering
about
is
that
there
is
only
one
president
and
the
executive
power
is
vested
in
him,
and
i
do
wonder
whether
or
not
the
precedents
you
said
with
respect
to
other
people
would
vest
this
to
a
grand
jury
either
on
his
own
motion
or
because
of
some
prosecutor
suggested
while
the
president
is
in
office
to
name
him
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator
with
grand
jury
sitting
all
over
the
united
states.
and,
occasionally,
you
find
a
politically
motivated
prosecutor.
that’s
a
rather
far-reaching
power,
if
it
exists.
