mr.
james
st.
clair
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
my
learning
brothers
approached
this
case
i
think
in
the
traditional
point
of
view,
namely,
this
is
an
attempt
by
a
special
prosecutor
to
obtain
what
he
thinks
is
desirable
evidence
in
a
criminal
prosecution
that
he
has
a
responsibility
for.
not
once,
however,
did
i
heard
him
mention
what
i
think
is
really
involved,
at
least
in
a
significant
part
and
that
is
the
co-pendency
of
the
impeachment
proceedings
before
the
house
of
representatives.
and,
the
realistic
fusion
that
has
taken
place
with
respect
to
these
two
proceedings
and
the
promise
of
continued
fusion,
as
i
understand
my
brother’s
position.
may
i
quote
from
page
50
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
think,
sir,
they
really
are.
first,
by
way
of
factual
background
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
st.
clair
right,
and
the
court
shall
not
be
used
to
implement
or
aid
that
process
which
what
has
happened
in
this
case.
this
case
wouldn’t
be
here
on
july
8.
mr.
james
st.
clair
alright
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
would
like
to
review
some
of
the
facts
for
you
in
this
regard.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
my
brother
has
mentioned
them
to
you.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
exactly
right,
sir.
not
only
that,
it
makes
the
case
unjusticiable
at
least.
now
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
the
case
should
be
dismissed,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
then
i
would
retract
what
i
said.
this
case
should
be
dismissed.[laughter]
mr.
james
st.
clair
alright.
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
sir.
i’m
talking
about
the
proceeding
before
the
district
court
through
the
court
of
appeals
to
this
court.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
as
i
say,
i
think
this
case
should
be
dismissed.
mr.
james
st.
clair
set
aside.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
right,
yes.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
agree.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
right.
that’s
why
i’m
trying
to
get
across
to
this
court,
perhaps
on
our
plea,
this
case
should
be
disposed
of,
be
it
by
vacating
the
order
below
or
not.
but,
in
any
event,
it
is
improper
in
our
view
that
this
case
should
be
heard
in
the
context
it
is
now
being
heard.
we
wouldn’t
be
here
on
july
8
before
a
crowded
courtroom
if
it
was
not
recognized
generally.
mr.
james
st.
clair
exactly
right.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and,
therefore,
it’s
a
non-justiciable
issue
in
this
and
in
the
district
court.
what
has
happened
in
this
case
is
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
believe
we
argued
a
non-justiciability
argument.
yes,
sir.
i
know
we
did,
but
if
you’re
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
in
this
context
at
this
time,
sir.
what
has
happened
is
this.
as
you
know,
on
february
24,
a
grand
jury
secretly
named
the
president
among
others
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator.
that
fact
was
not
made
known.
on
march
1,
an
indictment
was
returned
against
a
number
of
the
president’s
chief
aids.
coincident
with
that
in
an
open
courtroom,
the
assistant
prosecutor,
special
prosecutor,
handed
up
to
the
judge
a
bag
together
with
a
sealed
letter
requesting
that
this
material
be
sent
over
to
the
house
of
representatives.
the
president
took
no
position
regarding
that
proposal
because
he
considered
it
to
be
probably
appropriate,
under
the
belief
that
there
was
nothing
accusatory
in
that
material.
judge
sirica,
himself,
reviewed
the
material,
found
nothing
accusatory
and
said
it
would
therefore
be
quite
appropriate
to
send
this
material
to
the
house
of
representatives
not
realizing
and
not
knowing
that
the
special
prosecutor
had
previously
obtained
a
secret
chart
against
the
president
and
others
which
was
definitely
accusatory.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
material
was
turned
over.
it
was
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
james
st.
clair
a
grand
jury
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
material
was
sent
to
the
house
of
representatives
in
the
belief
that
it
was
non-accusatory
in
nature.
it
was
simply
a
recital
of
facts.
mr.
james
st.
clair
but
the
--mr.
jaworski
had
available
to
him,
unknown
to
the
judge
and
unknown
to
counsel
for
the
president,
a
secret
indictment
naming
the
president
as
a
co-conspirator.
the
accusatory
part
followed
later.
mr.
james
st.
clair
by
a
newspaper
leak.
mr.
james
st.
clair
it
didn’t
have
to
be.
all
they
had
to
do
was
read
the
newspaper.
there
can
be
no
question
about
it.
and
therefore,
i
say,
this
case
has
to
be
viewed
realistically
in
the
context
that
it
is
now
being
heard.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
think
it
would’ve
been
quite
appropriate
because
the
judge’s
decision
was
based
on
the
proposition
there
was
nothing
accusatory.
that,
under
the
circumstances,
absolute
fairness
was
appropriate
and
required
in
so
far
as
the
president
was
concerned.
no
one
could
argue
that
the
indictment
as
a
co-conspirator
or
naming
as
a
co-conspirator
does
anything
but
impair
the
president’s
position
before
the
house
of
representatives.
that
should,
in
my
judgment,
have
been
made
known
to
the
judge.
i
don’t
know
what
he
would’ve
done
under
those
circumstances.
his
decision
was
based
solidly
on
the
proposition
there
was
nothing
accusatory
in
the
material.
now,
my
brother
says
in
his
brief
that
this
material
he
now
seeks,
of
course,
would
be
available
to
the
house
committee
and
will
be
used
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
president
should
be
impeached.
so,
this
fusion
is
going
to
continue.
and
under
the
constitution,
as
we
view
it,
only
the
legislature
has
the
right
to
conduct
impeachment
proceedings.
the
courts
have
been,
from
the
history
involved
and
from
the
language
of
the
provisions,
excluded
from
that
function.
and,
yet,
the
special
prosecutor
is
drawing
this
court
in
to
those
proceedings
inevitably
and
inexorably.
no
one
could
stand
here
and
argue
with
any
candor
that
the
decision
of
this
court
would
have
no
impact
whatsoever
on
the
pending
inquiry
before
the
house
of
representatives
concerning
the
impeachment
of
the
president.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
would
not
say
that.
i
don’t
think
he
could
be
necessarily
subpoenaed.
i
don’t
think
the
president
is
subject
to
the
process
of
the
court,
unless
he
so
determines
he
would
give
evidence.
but,
the
murder
would
have
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
in
this
case
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
justice
stewart,
i’m
not.
the
subject
matter
--
these
two
matters,
is
the
same
subject
matter.
mr.
james
st.
clair
should
the
president
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
right.
mr.
james
st.
clair
right.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
say
it
should
not
go
forward
a
this
time,
at
the
very
least,
because
the
subject
matter
being
inquired
of
in
the
large
measure
before
the
house
committee
is
exactly
the
same
subject
matter
being
involved
in
this
argument.
mr.
james
st.
clair
namely,
should
the
president
produce
tapes?
should
he
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
not
stand
on
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
pardon?
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
if
your
honor
please,
the
house
of
representatives
have
subpoenaed
these
and
more
tapes.
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
i
don’t.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
i
don
know
that
there’s
a
preliminary
showing
that
they
re
conversations
between
the
president
and
his
close
aids,
and
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
regardless
of
what
it
is
and
may
involve
a
number
of
subjects.
mr.
james
st.
clair
he
claims
that,
but
he
has
no
way
of
showing
it.
in
fact,
he
says
it’s
only
probable
or
likely.
there
is
no
way
of
showing
that
they,
in
fact,
involve
the
subjects
of
watergate.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
presume
that’s
so
and
he
would
then
--
it
would
be
made
available
to
the
special
prosecutor.
the
special
prosecutor
says
that,
of
course,
this
would
then
become
part
of
the
impeachment
proceedings,
and
here
we
are.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
james
st.
clair
really,
it’s
a
matter
of
accommodation
not
as
a
matter
of
assertion
of
a
right
of
one
branch
over
another.
but
the
point
i
want
to
make,
justice
burger,
is
that
the
same
subject
matter
is
inexorably
involved
in
both
proceedings,
now
proceeding
on
at
the
same
time.
and,
the
house
of
representatives
has
not
sought
the
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
that’s
a
very
good
question
i’d
like
to
answer.
the
decisions
that
are
made
in
an
impeachment
proceeding,
justice
marshall,
are
essentially
political
decisions.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
we
will
because
they’ve
already
been
made
public.
mr.
james
st.
clair
we
are
--
as
soon
as
a
judge
approves
some
method
of
validating
the
accuracy
of
these
tapes,
they
can
have
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
they
can
have
the
tapes,
but
you
have
to
understand.
the
tape
is
a
part
of
a
reel.
a
reel
may
cover
a
dozen
conversations.
so,
there’s
a
mechanical
problem
of
trying
to
validate
or
be
sure
that
this
is
correct
but
it’s
only
a
mechanical
problem.
but
once
that’s
solved,
subject
to
the
judge
bellow’s
approval,
they
have
the
availability
of
that
but
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
we
think
so.
that’s
why
we
made
them.
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
say
this.
i
say
the
president
should
decide
as
a
political
matter
of
what
should
be
made
available
to
the
house,
that
the
court
ought
not
to
be
drawn
into
that
decision.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
house
takes
a
different
view.
the
house
has
subpoenaed
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
145
tapes,
and
that’s
a
political
decision.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
president
has
not
honored
any
of
the
subpoenas
other
than
the
first
one
issued
by
the
house,
so
that
there
is
a
dispute
in
the
house
now
between
the
president
and
the
committee
on
the
judiciary.
it’s
essentially
a
political
dispute.
it’s
a
dispute
that
this
court
ought
not
to
be
drawn
into
and
this
result
of
a
decision
in
this
case
would
inexorably
result
in
being
brought
into
it.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
impact
of
a
decision
in
this
case,
undeniably,
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
my
view
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
cannot
have
--
it
will
not
be
overlooked.
mr.
james
st.
clair
what
i
would
think
would
be
inappropriate
thing
to
do
at
this
time
because
there
is
pending
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
i
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
will
argue
that
in
a
moment,
but
i’m
arguing
now
that
you
should
not.
i’m
arguing
now,
sir,
only
that
you
should
not
because
it
would
involve
this
court
inexorably
in
a
political
process
which
has
been
determined
by
the
constitution
to
be
solely
the
function
of
the
legislative
branch.
and,
it
cannot
be
that
the
impact
of
the
court’s
decision
in
this
matter,
which
is
one
of
the
principle
matters
now
pending
before
the
house,
would
be
overlooked.
it
would
certainly,
as
a
matter
of
realistic
fact,
to
have
a
significant
impact.
mr.
james
st.
clair
mr.
justice
douglas,
we
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
it
may.
the
brady
issue,
we
don’t
believe,
is
properly
before
the
court
and
ha
not
been
briefed
by
us
nor
by
my
brother.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and
was
not
decided
by
the
district
court.
i
would
only
say
this,
that
in
the
experience
that
i’ve
had
in
connection
with
cases
tried
such
as
the
stan
mitchell
case
in
new
york,
the
chapman
case
in
washington,
the
ehrlichman
case
now
going
on.
there
has
never
been
a
claim
that
the
president
has
not
made
available
appropriate
and
adequate
brady
material.
but,
i
don’t
believe
it’s
before
this
court
at
this
time,
what
is
before
this
court
is
a
prosecutor’s
demand
for
evidence.
and
may
i
direct
my
regards
for
a
moment
to
that
problem.
he
says
that,
in
effect,
we
have
no
right
to
be
here.
we
have
delegated
the
who,
the
when,
and
with
what
issues
to
him.
we
have
delegated
the
who
and
the
when.
and,
pursuant
to
that,
he
has
indicted
a
number
of
people
and
he
has
indicted
him
as
such
time
as
he
thought
appropriate.
but,
even
he
concedes
that
we
did
not
delegate
to
him
what
presidential
conversations
would
be
used
as
evidence.
that
was
reserved,
and
he
concedes
that
that
is
the
fact
and
that’s
what
is
at
issue
here.
not
when
and
who
is
to
is
to
be
indicted,
but
what
presidential
communications
are
going
to
be
used
as
evidence?
and
that’s
what
the
issue
is
in
this
case.
mr.
james
st.
clair
two
or
three
days.
mr.
james
st.
clair
it’s
my
argument
and
the
fact.
for
example,
in
the
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
they
have
been
screened
out
in
the
transcripts.
whatever
has
been
published
to
the
public,
we
are
quite
prepared
to
verify
the
accuracy
of.
in
the
course
of
those
transcripts,
there
are
first
portions
left
out.
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
we
simply
published
the
portion
of
that
conversation
that
did
not
relate
to
that
with
a
notation
that
a
portion
has
been
left
out.
mr.
james
st.
clair
it
was
let
out
because
it
did
not
involve
presidential
action
as
it
related
to
watergate
or
something
to
that
effect.
we
did
not
disclose
the
substance
of
that
left
out
material.
mr.
james
st.
clair
there
might
well
be
such
a
reason.
my
proper
to
my
brother
has
been
that
we
will
verify
the
accuracy
of
the
printed
transcript.
so,
this
1,240
odd
pages
of
presidential
conversations
that
are
available
to
the
public
and
available
to
him
will
be
usable
in
the
trial.
now,
this
may
well
involve
a
mechanism
approved
by
the
court
involving
counsel
for
the
defendants
to
be
satisfied.
so,
they’re
satisfied
that
the
copy
is
accurate.
but,
this
all
have
to
be
expurgated
out
of
a
reel
of
tape
that
may
involve
several
days’
conversations.
mr.
james
st.
clair
but
it’s
essentially
a
mechanical
problem.
mr.
james
st.
clair
other
than
the
20
that
are
already
published,
no
effort
has
been
made
as
yet,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
because,
if
your
honor
please,
we
haven’t
felt
that
it
has
been
necessary
to
do
so
because
we
firmly
feel
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
that
the
president
has
every
right
to
refuse
to
do
so.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
we
move
to
quash
it.
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
sir,
we
didn’t.
we
moved
to
quash
it.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and
we
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
if
your
honor
please,
we
are
submitting
the
matter
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
to
this
court,
under
a
special
appearance
on
behalf
of
the
president.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
yes,
in
a
sense.
mr.
james
st.
clair
in
a
sense.
mr.
james
st.
clair
in
the
sense
that
this
court
has
an
obligation
to
determine
the
law,
alright?
the
president
also
has
an
obligation
to
carry
out
his
constitutional
functions.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
probably,
the
question
is
even
more
limited
than
that.
is
the
executive
privilege,
which
my
brother
concedes,
absolute
or
is
it
only
conditional?
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
this
is
being
submitted
to
this
court
for
its
guidance
and
judgment
with
respect
to
the
law.
the
president,
on
the
other
hand,
has
his
obligations
under
the
constitution.
mr.
james
st.
clair
as
to
what
the
law
is,
yes,
of
course.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
would
not
be
here.
now,
my
brother
says
i
have
no
right
to
even
challenge
his
right
to
be
here,
and
i’d
like
to
deal
with
that
for
a
moment.
this
is,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
essentially
an
executive
department
matter.
whatever
may
have
been
the
arrangements
between
the
branches
of
the
executive
matter
with
respect
to
evidentiary
matters,
and
in
fact
there
were
no
arrangements
regarding
evidentiary
matters,
it
is
not
the
function
of
the
court
to
direct
or
rule
what
evidence
will
be
presented
to
it
by
the
executive
and
that
executives
dully
prosecute
it.
if
this
was
a
united
states
attorney,
this
case
wouldn’t
be
here,
of
course.
it’s
here
only
because
certain
things
were
delegated
to
the
special
prosecutor.
but,
the
special
prosecutor
was
not
delegated
the
right
to
tell
the
president
one
of
his
conversations
are
going
to
be
made
available
as
evidence.
that
was
specifically
reserved
and
the
only
thing
that
my
brother
can
do
is
argue
about
it,
and
that’s
what
he’s
doing
right
here
today.
and,
therefore
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
the
united
states
attorney
would
be
directed.
mr.
james
st.
clair
by
the
president
or
the
attorney
general
at
the
direction
of
the
president.
mr.
james
st.
clair
by
the
attorney
general
at
the
direction
of
the
president.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
think
so,
but
most
cases
don’t
involve
presidential
conversations.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
think
that’s
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
with
all
due
respect.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
president
says
to
the
attorney
general
“i’m
not
going
to
produce
this
material.”
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
right.
mr.
james
st.
clair
in
my
view,
the
president
would
instruct
the
attorney
general
to
instruct
the
united
states
attorney
to
withdraw
his
motion.
mr.
james
st.
clair
then
we’d
have
a
new
united
states
attorney.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
i
made
a
little
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
think
that
united
states
attorney,
in
all
respect,
would
and
should
be
removed
from
that
case.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
executive
power
of
the
government
is
not
vested
in
the
united
states
attorney.
it’s
vested
in
one
man,
and
that
man
is
the
president
of
the
united
states.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
but
that
statute,
which
my
brother
cites
in
his
brief
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
does
not
deprive
nor
could
it
deprive
the
president
of
his
constitutional
authority
to
be
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer.
he
shall
take
care
to
se
that
the
law
is
enforced.
the
executive
power
is
vested
in
him,
in
one
man.
and,
the
attorney
general
is
nothing
but
a
surrogate
for
the
president
of
the
united
states.
mr.
james
st.
clair
perhaps
as
to
everything
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
right.
mr.
james
st.
clair
perhaps,
with
respect
to
everything
except,
the
president
did
not
delegate
to
the
special
prosecutor
the
right
to
tell
him
whether
or
not
his
confidential
communication
should
be
made
available
as
evidence.
so
that,
within
the
package
of
executive
power
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
normally
represented
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
normally
represented
by
the
executive
department
as
to
who
shall
be
prosecutor
that’s
been
delegated
to
this
gentleman.
he
has
exercised
that
power.
when:
he’s
done
that,
with
what
evidence:
he’s
done
that
as
we’ll
deal
with
in
a
few
moments.
but,
not
with
that
portion
of
the
evidence
that’s
available
that
constitutes
presidential
confidential
communication.
that’s
been
specifically
reserved.
and
the
special
prosecutor
cannot,
and
even
if
the
president
did
give
him
that
authority,
probably
could
not,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
delegate
that.
but
in
any
event,
he
did
not
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
right
to
order
the
president
to
give
up
confidential
communications.
that
was
not
delegated.
mr.
james
st.
clair
right,
and
the
president,
under
no
circumstances,
gave
up
any
of
his
defenses
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and
i’m
making
them
right
now.
and
even
if
we
did
agree
between
us
that
we
would
vest
this
court
with
jurisdiction
simply
because
of
the
politics
of
the
situation,
this
court
in
its
decisions
would
not
accept
the
vesting
of
such
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
st.
clair
because
this
court
determines
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
parties
can
agree
that
it
hasn’t
but—
mr.
james
st.
clair
if
it
goes
that
far.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
right.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
think
not
in
the
terms
of
separation
of
powers,
if
i
may.
my
brother’s
point
of
view
is,
he
views
himself
as
the
united
states
as
distinguished
from
a
member
of
the
executive
branch.
and,
in
his
brief,
he
invokes
the
united
states
is
really
a
fourth
entity.
mr.
james
st.
clair
constitutionally,
a
special
prosecutor
with
the
powers
that
my
brother
suggests
he
has
is
a
constitutional
anomaly.
we
have
only
three
branches,
not
three-and-a
third
or
three-and-a
half
or
four.
there’s
only
one
executive
branch
and
the
executive
power
is
vested
in
a
president.
now
if,
for
political
reasons,
the
president
wants
to
dole
out
some
of
those
powers,
he
may
so
do
and
has
done
in
this
case.
but,
he
cannot
vest
jurisdiction
on
a
court
that,
otherwise,
the
court
would
not
have
nor
should
the
court
accept
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that
is
correct,
and
he
has
not
been
dismissed.
mr.
james
st.
clair
nor
is
he
likely
to
be
dismissed.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
point
is,
if
i
may
make
it,
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
the
president
gave
up
his
right
to
protect
the
confidentiality
of
his
conversations.
mr.
james
st.
clair
no
claim
is
made
that
he
did.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and
my
brother
concedes.[laughter]
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
what
we
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
if
we
get
beyond
the
subject
matter
situation.
now,
if
this
were
the
nixon
against
sirica
case
where
you
didn’t
have
what
i
think
is
a
dispositive
problem
in
this
case,
namely,
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
judicial
branch
to
determine
this
intra-executive
branch
if
we
had
a
grand
jury
subpoena,
as
was
true
in
the
nixon
against
sirica
case.
then,
you
have
intra-branch
and
the
court
would
have
a
better
standing
in
its
responsibility
to
see
the
grand
juries
which
are
under
its
jurisdiction
to
have
such
evidence
as
they
thought
appropriate.
but,
we’re
well
beyond
that
stage.
17c
requires
a
great,
much
more
restricted
form
of
evidence
that’s
got
to
be
relevant
and
admissible.
it’s
nothing
like
a
grand
jury
subpoena.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
i
don’t
think
that
the
controller
general
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
represents,
if
your
honor
please,
that
basic
constitutional
structure
has
been
changed.
it
may
be
that
he
has
executive
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
and
he
may
have
legislative
functions.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
understand.
he
is
created
by
a
legislative,
very
much
like
a
semi-independent
agency.
in
one
aspect,
he’s
an
agent
of
the
legislature.
in
the
other
aspect,
he’s
an
agent
of
the
executive.
but,
we
don’t
have
any
more
than
legislative,
judicial,
and
executive
branches.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
i’m
sure
the
court
couldn’t.
i’m
not
too
clear
about
the
president
under
the
myers
case.
i
really
haven’t
thought
that
much
of
it.
it
could
be
that
he
could
be
fired,
but
i
think
that’s
really
somewhat
beside
the
point
because
this
issue
really
turns
on
an
admission
that,
as
to
the
element
of
the
executive
power
here
involved,
namely,
presidential
conversations,
they
weren’t
delegated.
so,
whatever
else
may
have
been
delegated,
those
were
not.
and,
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
resolve
a
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not
they
should
be
given
up
because
that
would
involve
this
court
in
the
prosecution
of
the
case
and
the
judicial
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
it
can,
sir,
with
respect
to
third
parties
but
it
should
not
involve
itself
with
the
executive
function
of
prosecuting
the
case.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
entirely
judicial.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and,
that,
we
move
to
quash
as
we
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
denial
of
our
motion
to
quash
is
one
of
the
issues
before
us.
that’s
right.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
guess
it’s
about
the
same
thing
as
whether
or
not
it
should
be
quashed
and
i
think
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
that
amounts
to
the
same
thing.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well
it
is
not,
in
the
context
of
the
proceedings
here
but,
in
the
context
of
whether
it’s
in
fact
involved
in
this
case,
it
is,
i
suggest,
political
in
the
sense
that
this
information
being
sought
admittedly
will
become
available
then
to
the
house.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well
the
question
is,
is
it
a
proper
issue
of
a
subpoena.
mr.
james
st.
clair
judges
make
mistakes,
as
do
lawyers,
and
maybe
even
presidents,
for
all
i
know,
but
the
point
i
want
to
make
with
you,
sir,
is
that
this
is
an
executive
function,
an
executive
decision,
one
not
delegated
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
we
submit
that
the
court
improperly
assisted
him,
that
the
court
has
no
right
to
determine
what
the
executive
will
offer
in
evidence.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and,
this
is
the
function
of
the
president.
no
one
has
contended
that
the
president
has
given
up
his
executive
responsibilities
under
the
constitution
and,
certainly,
the
prosecution
of
criminal
cases
is
an
executive
function.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
we
don’t
turn
them
loose
everyday
but
we
have
turned
a
number
loose
in
the
president’s
discretion
in
which
he
thought
was
an
appropriate
thing
to
do,
and
that’s
his
determination
that
governs,
we
suggest.
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
this
would
be
repetitious,
your
honor.
when,
already,
it
has
been
made
public.
mr.
james
st.
clair
those
20
--
those
would
be
the
tapes
of
20
conversations
already
made
public.
mr.
james
st.
clair
we’ll
provide
a
means
whereby
their
accuracy
can
be
verified.
mr.
james
st.
clair
to
release
a
whole
reel
of
tape
involving
a
number
of
conversations
poses
a
mechanical
problem.
mr.
james
st.
clair
in
so
far
as
it
relates
to
the
presidential
conversation
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
another
issue.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
correct,
sir.
i
don’t
know
how
separate
they
are
but
i’ll
certainly
make
use
of
both
of
them.
mr.
james
st.
clair
but
i’m
making
both
of
them
and
if
they’re
separate,
fine.
now,
with
respect
to
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
i
don’t
want
to
mislead
the
court
into
thinking
that
i
believe
mr.
jaworski
has
no
right
to
determine
any
evidence
that
he
communes.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and
i
think
they’re
well-founded
in
the
law.
mr.
james
st.
clair
now
i’d
like
to
move,
if
i
may,
to
briefly
--
the
suggestion
that
the
issue
here
is
non-justiciable
on
the
grounds
other
than
i’ve
already
mentioned,
namely,
the
context
in
which
this
case
unfortunately
finds
itself.
it
seems
to
us,
briefly,
that
the
case
is
non-justiciable
for
somewhat
more
technical
reasons.
first,
this
is
an
issue
where
if
someone
has
to
exercise
some
discretion,
there
are
no
real
bounds
or
standards
by
which
that
discretion
should
be
exercised.
and,
by
traditional
standards
of
this
court
where
that
exists,
then
this
court
ought
not
to
take
the
case.
secondly,
it
seems
to
me,
there
is
a
textual
constitutional
grant
if
we
assume
that
the
grant
of
executive
power
includes
the
means
by
which
that
can
be
effectively
exercised,
second
ground.
third,
of
course,
there
is
the
political
involvement
which
i
have
suggested.
therefore,
i
suggest
quite
briefly
that
even
if
there
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
the
case
is
non-justiciable
for
these
additional
reasons.
the
standards
of
baker
and
carr,
and
powell
are
not
applicable
here.
there
are
no
individual’s
rights
over
being
protected
against
the
onslaught
of
government.
the
president
is
not
here
as
an
individual.
he
is
here
as
a
constitutional
officer
and
whom
the
executive
powers
rested.
there
is
no
philosophy
that
would
support
a
finding
of
justiciability
on
the
grounds
that
were
strengthening
the
democratic
process,
as
was
true
in
powell
and
also
into
a
greater
extent
in
baker
and
carr.
if
anything,
a
decision
in
this
case
against
the
president
would
tend
to
diminish
the
democratic
process.
this
president
was
elected
on
the
theory
that
he
would
have
all
the
powers,
duties,
and
responsibilities
of
any
other
president.
and
if
it’s
determined
that
he
doesn’t,
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
diminution
of
the
political
aspect
of
the
case
in
so
far
as
the
constituents
who
voted
for
him
are
concerned.
this
president
ought
not
to
have
any
less
powers
than
any
other
president
ought
to
have.
one
of
the
necessary
results,
as
i
view
it
and
my
brother’s
argument,
is
that
because
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case
richard
nixon
is,
let’s
say,
an
85%
president
not
100%
president.
and,
that
can’t
be
constitutional.
the
framers
of
the
constitution
had
in
mind
a
strong
presidency.
as
we
know,
they
considered
a
number
of
alternatives,
maybe
a
presidency
consisting
of
three
members.
all
of
those
suggestions
were
discarded
and
a
strong
presidency
was
decided
upon,
may
i
say,
to
the
distinct
advantage
of
this
country
as
history
has
developed.
now
by
reason
of
an
action
of
a
grand
jury,
the
special
prosecutor
suggest
that
this
president
has
something
less
than
any
other
president
would
have.
i
would
only
call
your
attention
to
the
action
of
the
framers
in
constitutional
convention
when
the
issue
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
a
president
who
was
under
impeachment
should
be
suspended
during
the
pendency
of
the
impeachment
proceedings.
and,
the
decision
was
definitely
he
should
not
because
the
framers
envisioned
a
strong
active
president
even
in
the
course
of
impeachment
proceedings.
they
did
not
want
this
country
to
be
led
by
someone
who
didn’t
have
those
full
powers
even
if
he
was
then
under
impeachment.
and,
indeed,
this
president
continues
to
function
as
president
as
he
should
even
though
there
are
impeachment
inquiries
underway.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
think
it
involves
both.
it’s
non-justiciable,
if
i
may,
because
it
does
involve
the
court
in
a
political
matter.
now,
mere
fact
that
politics
is
involve,
of
course,
has
not
prevented
the
court
from
taking
action
in
appropriate
cases
where
individual
rights
were
involved
or
where
the
franchise
of
voters
could
be
strengthened
by
the
decision
of
the
court.
i’m
suggesting,
in
this
case,
the
converse
is
true.
therefore,
the
justification
between
baker
and
carr
and
in
the
powell
case
is
not
available
or
is
not
applicable
here.
furthermore,
however,
the
argument
still,
in
my
view,
has
force
with
respect
to
the
consequences
of
the
grand
jury
action
in
naming
him
as
a
co-conspirator
which
we
suggest
they
were
not
qualified
to
do.
the
president
is
not
above
the
law
by
any
means.
but
the
law,
as
to
the
president,
has
to
be
applied
in
a
constitutional
way
which
is
different
than
anyone
else.
namely,
we
suggest
that
he
can
only
be
impeached
while
in
office
and
cannot
be
indicted
until
such
time
as
he
no
longer
is
in
office.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well
then
the
naming
of
the
president
by
a
grand
jury
as
a
co-conspirator,
if
that
has
the
effect
of
diminishing
the
president’s
rights,
it’s
a
pro
tanto,
if
i
may
say
so,
impeachment.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that
could
be
said
but
by
the
naming
him
of
an
unindicted
co-conspirator,
we
suggest,
is
an
intrusion
by
the
grand
jury
on
a
function
that
is
solely
legislative
and
not
judicial.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well
in
questions
of
immunity,
i
think,
individually
he
could
be
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
correct.
i
think
the
president
could
be
sued
for
backtaxes
in
his
individual
capacity.
but
in
terms
of
his
power
to
affect
the
responsibilities
of
his
office
to
protect
the
presidency
from
unwarranted
intrusions
into
the
confidentiality
of
his
communications,
that’s
not
a
personal
matter.
mr.
james
st.
clair
as
i
had
suggested,
that
if
that
defendant
will
satisfy
a
court
that
there
is
such
a
tape
and
will
identify
or
even
come
close
to
it
and
persuade
the
court
that
that
would
exonerate
him
or
there’s
reason
to
believe
it
might,
i
don’t
believe
will
have
a
question.
but,
that’s
not
what
my
brother
here
is
asking
for.
he’s
asking
for
a
set
number
of
tapes,
not
for
brady
purposes.
although
he
throws
that
in,
but
he
really
wants
them,
he
says,
for
prosecution
and
i’d
like
to
review
with
the
court
the
question
of
the
necessity
shown
for
this
because,
even
on
his
theory
of
a
qualified
privilege,
there
has
to
be
a
showing
of
some
necessity.
now
we
should
understand,
i’m
sure
the
court
knows,
that
all
of
these
individuals
here
involved
have
testified
before
the
senate
select
committee
with
the
exception,
i
believe
of
mr.
colson
who
now
has
plead
guilty
under
a
plea
bargain
where
he’s
agreed
to
cooperate
so
the
special
prosecutor
has
the
full
benefit
of
his
testimony.
they
have
testified
on
one
or
more
occasions
before
a
grand
jury.
in
addition,
the
president
has
furnished
to
the
special
prosecutor
the
transcripts
and
tapes
of
the
critical
conversations
involved
in
this
alleged
conspiracy.
i
might
reveal
those
very
briefly
with
you.
mr.
dean
in
his
senate
committee
testimony
suggested
that
on
september
15
the
president
acknowledged
knowledge
of
a
cover
up.
he
changed
that
later
to
a
testimony
that
he
believed
that
was
so
or
it
was
inference.
but
in
any
event,
the
president
furnished
that
portion
of
that
tape
of
the
conversation
with
mr.
dean.
mr.
dean
also
testified
that
on
march
13,
1973
he
discussed
the
cover
up
with
the
president
in
efforts
to
blackmail
the
president
by
one
of
the
defendants
who
broke
into
the
democratic
national
headquarters.
later
developed
that
that
was
mistaken
and
it
was
actually
on
march
21
and
the
grand
jury
indictment
proceeds
on
the
theory
of
march
21.
the
tape
of
the
conversation
of
march
13
was
furnished.
all
of
the
conversations
between
the
principals
being
two
in
number
on
march
21
were
furnished.
the
conversation
between
the
individuals
and
the
presidents
on
the
next
day
in
the
afternoon,
march
22,
was
furnished.
and,
a
large
number
of
additional
conversations
were
furnished.
now
if
reynolds
means
anything
and
reynolds,
in
addition
to
the
kaiser
aluminum
case,
noted
a
constitutional
question,
as
i
think
one
of
the
later
justices
suggested,
one
of
the
reasons
for
not
facing
that
issue
in
that
case
was
it
was
not
necessary
because
in
the
case
it
was
a
crash
of
a
bomber
that
was
on
a
secret
mission
and
the
court
said
that
the
parties
had
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses,
the
survivors,
and
other
testimony
so
it
wasn’t
necessary
to
get
to
the
constitutional
question.
i
suggest
that
that’s
true
here.
it’s
difficult
for
me
to
conceive
a
prosecutor
who
has
more
evidence
than
this
prosecutor
has.
he
has
the
full
benefit
of
a
senate
select
committee
investigation
which
staff
had
50
odd
lawyers,
existed
for
a
year.
he
has
the
benefit
of
his
own
investigation
of
a
grand
jury
that
sat
for
19
months
with
an
investigative
staff
of
similar
proportions.
he
simply
says
“i
need
this
because
i
want
to
present
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
case.”
he
does
not
say
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
a
tape
of
a
conversation
is
very
raw
material.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
right.
does
he
really
need
this?
what
does
he
say
he
needs
it
for?
he
says
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
he
doesn’t
say
that.
he
made
a
showing
to
the
court
below.
the
showing
is
available
to
you
here.
mr.
james
st.
clair
he
has
the
burden.
he
has
the
burden
under
reynolds,
under
kaiser
aluminum,
and
so
forth.
the
show
that
he
needs
and
what
does
he
says
he
needs
it
for.
he
doesn’t
say
he
needs
it
to
obtain
conviction.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes.
mr.
james
st.
clair
we
have
to
make
such
a
showing
and
i
say
that’s
our
only
burden.
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
it
would
have
to
be
a
confidential
communication.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
but
its
president
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
or
a
tennis
game
or
whatever.
mr.
james
st.
clair
my
brother
doesn’t
suggest
that’s
what
he
wants
either.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
a
little
closer
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
president
as
a
political
office
to
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
don’t
think
it’s
very
close,
no.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
don’t
think
my
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
my
brother
isn’t
seeking
any
such
conversations.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
as
i
read
some
of
the
cases
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
we
have
not
done
that.
we
have
simply
responded
to
an
assertion
that
these
all
relate
to
watergate,
assuming
that
to
be
the
fact.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
would
think
it
would
be.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
because
he
has
the
duty;
(a)
to
enforce
the
laws,
that
is
to
prosecute
these
cases
and;
(b)
he
had
to
take
care
to
see
that
the
laws
are
enforced,
that
is
to
investigate.
and,
much
of
this
material
does
relate
to
the
investigation
as
1,200
and
some
pages
of
the
public
transcript
fully
discloses.
but
i
would
be
ready
to
concede,
and
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
difficult
problem
between
us,
that
the
president
should
show
that
the
circumstances
are
appropriate
for
the
claim
of
such
a
privilege
and
i
think
such
language
appears
in
mink
and
perhaps
in
reynolds
and
in
kaiser
aluminum.
simply,
it
has
to
be
a
confidential
communication
first
of
all.
mr.
james
st.
clair
first,
mink,
i
believe,
was
a
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
statutory
case,
but
that
was
one
of
the
exceptions.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
it
is,
if
it’s
confidential
and
it’s
between
the
president
and
some
advisor
with
respect
to
him
because,
otherwise
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
it
might
well
have
to
do
with
the
decision
making
process
if
the
facts
are
such
as
were
developed
in
the
course
of
an
investigation
with
regard
to
the
existence
of
a
obstruction
of
justice
charge,
much
of
which
the
president
was
involved
in.
but
the
fact
against
opinions
and
decisions
really
relate
to
another
situation,
as
i
suggest,
in
the
statute.
but,
the
conversation
that
the
president
has
with
his
advisers,
we
suggest,
is
absolutely
privilege.
it’s
a
discretionary
matter
that
he
has
to
exercise
in
what
he
is
going
to
release
and
not
release.
and
since
marbury
and
madison,
mississippi
and
johnson,
it’s
been
clear
that
the
court
will
not
direct
a
president
to
exercise
his
discretion
in
any
manner.
this
is
not
to
say
the
court
won’t
strike
down,
as
in
sawyer,
excessive
action
on
the
part
of
the
president
or
excessive
action
on
the
part
of
the
legislature.
that
has
happened
in
a
number
of
times.
but,
it’s
a
far
different
thing
to
suggest
that
the
court
should
undertake
to
direct
the
president
to
exercise
his
discretion
in
a
certain
manner.
it’s
not
a
ministerial
duty
by
any
means.
it’s
a
matter
of
discretion.
there
are
some
things
he
feels
he
properly
should,
under
the
circumstances,
make
available
and
others
he
shouldn’t.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i’d
like
to
discuss
very
briefly
gravel,
if
i
may,
for
example.
i
think
this
raises
a
very
important
question.
there
is,
of
course,
an
explicit
speech
and
debate
immunity
in
providing
the
constitution.
as
our
brief
indicates,
the
reason
for
this
is
quite
clear.
it’s
to
protect
the
legislature
from
unwarranted
invasion
from
the
executive
and
perhaps
the
judicial.
it
does
not
mean
that
the
executive
is
not
entitled
to
substantially
the
same
thing
by
implication.
and
at
least
in
the
civil
field,
as
we
have
pointed
out,
the
courts
have
worked
out
by
implication
as
a
necessary
ingredient
to
the
function
of
the
duties
of
the
executive
an
absolute
immunity
from
civil
liability
for
actions
taken
within
the
sphere
of
the
official.
swelling
and
violas,
i
guess,
is
the
leading
case
as
cited
and
barr
v.
mateo,
and
other
cases.
if
such
a
matter
can
be
worked
out
with
respect
to
the
executive
on
civil
matters,
we
suggest
there
is
no
reason
why
and,
in
fact,
the
court
should
spell
out
a
similar
exemption
in
criminal
matters
especially
as
they
relate
to
the
president,
himself,
because
while
i
said
the
president
is
not
above
the
law,
the
law
can
only
be
made
applicable
to
him
in
a
certain
way
while
he
is
in
office.
now
if
a
junior
congressman
can
commit
a
crime
on
the
floor
of
the
house
as
apparently
as
possible,
under
gravel
and
johnson,
is
it
to
be
said
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
less
immunity
than
a
junior
congressman?
i
think
not.
so
that,
i
suggest
to
you
that
common
sense
and
proper
construction
of
the
constitution
impinged
within
the
grant
of
executive
power
all
of
those
necessary
ingredients
to
make
it
work
to
be
effective
which
would
include
immunity
and
criminal
immunity.
the
president,
we
suggest,
cannot
be
indicted,
can’t
even
be
named
as
a
co-conspirator
because
that’s
an
assumption
of
a
legislative
function
under
the
constitution.
and,
therefore,
we
suggest
that
even
if
this
is
criminal
the
president
is
immune
from
the
ordinary
criminal
process.
he
is
not
immune
from
process,
but
that
process
that’s
available
to
the
president
is
a
process
of
impeachment
which
does
not
include
the
function
of
the
judiciary
branch.
and,
therefore,
we
say
that
if,
under
gravel,
the
congressman
is
entitled
to
immunity
even
from
criminal
conduct
where
actions
taken
within
the
legislative
sphere
of
his
conduct,
then
it
would
be
very
hard
to
support
a
proposition
that
the
president,
as
the
chief
executive
of
the
country,
is
entitled
to
less.
mr.
james
st.
clair
right,
and
the
reason
they
didn’t,
sir,
was
it
was
not
found
to
be
necessary.
they
didn’t
put
civil
immunity
in
the
constitution
either
for
the
executive
branch
and
this
court
has
found,
of
course,
that
there
is
such
an
immunity.
i’m
sorry,
sir?
mr.
james
st.
clair
it
was
a
speech
and
debate
clause
case
and
it
even
forbad
as
i
understand
the
gravel
case,
the
grand
jury
inquiry
into
motivations
and
actions
of
the
senator
and
his
aid.
mr.
james
st.
clair
right,
and
i
suggest
the
constitution,
by
clear
implication
provides
the
same
not
only
for
the
executive
but
for
the
judicial
as
well,
but
certainly
for
the
executive.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
i
would
suggest
you
should
find
it
in
the
constitution.
it
need
not
be
explicit.
it
can
well
be
implied.
mr.
james
st.
clair
if
you
cannot
find
it?
mr.
james
st.
clair
then,
if
your
honor
please,
that
portion
of
the
argument
is
lost
as
far
as
this
court’s
concerned,
i
guess.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
correct.
and,
we’re
suggesting
that
it
should
in
this
case
not
necessarily
because
a
great
deal
is
now
left
to
be
gained
by
expunging
the
grand
jury
action.
my
brother
is
right.
the
damages
has
been
done
and
we
think
quite
improperly
so.
we
think
the
tactics
involved
with
the
prosecutor
in
seeking
to
make,
enlarging
the
scope
of
admissible
testimony
is
hardly
worth
what
has
been
done
here
but
it’s
been
done.
but,
it
seems
to
me,
history
would
e
served
by
granting
of
the
relief
we
have
prayed
for
below,
namely,
to
expunge
this.
secondly,
it
seems
to
me
the
american
people
would
feel
better
about
the
fairness
of
the
issues
now
pending
before
the
house
is
this
act
which
we
say
was
improper
and
illegal
were
expunged.
but
in
so
far
as
the
mechanisms
of
this
case
are
concerned,
it
destroys
or
removes
a
basis
upon
which
they
contend
they
are
entitled
to
these
documents.
i’d
like
to
address
that
for
a
moment.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and
up
today,
you’ve
never
had
a
president
of
the
united
states
named
as
a
co-conspirator
either,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and
the
president
of
the
united
states
--[laughter]
and
i
don’t
mean
to
be
facetious
about
it
but
the
president
of
the
united
states,
we
suggest,
can
be
proceeded
against
only
by
impeachment
while
in
office
and
his
powers
are
unabated
until
such
time
as
he
leaves
that
office.
now,
with
respect
to
this
suggestion
that
a
grand
jury
finding
his
prima
facie
evidence
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
no.
this
case
is
unusual
in
many
respects.
this
suggestion
that
a
grand
jury
finding
is
prima
facie
evidence
and,
therefore,
the
president
has
lost
whatever
privilege
he
otherwise
would
have
had
it
just
isn’t
borne
out
by
either
the
facts
or
the
legal
issues
and
principals
involved.
the
grand
jury
finding
is
not
prima
facie
evidence.
even
if
it’s
mentioned
in
an
opening
argument
in
a
criminal
trial,
there’s
a
grave
risk
of
a
mistrial.
the
cases
cited
by
my
brother,
particularly
the
clark
case,
are
clearly
cases
which
require
a
showing
in
court
or,
in
clark,
a
showing
to
the
judge
that
there
was
prima
facie
evidence
of
wrong
doing.
you
may
recall
that’s
a
case
involving
investigation
into
a
juror
as
to
whether
or
not
the
juror
had
performed
properly,
and
the
juror
had
been
shown,
had
testified
falsely
in
the
qualifications
that
she
had
never
had
any
business
relations
with
one
of
the
parties
when,
in
fact,
she
had.
the
court
said
“well,
there’s
a
finding
of
wrong
doing
and,
based
on
that,
now
i
will
look
into
the
juror’s
deliberations
to
see
what
she
did.”
but,
justice
cardozo
made
it
very
clear
that
if
he
hadn’t
been
able
to
make
a
prima
facie
showing
a
wrong
doing
by
evidence
before
him
there
would
have
been
no
cause
for
“letting
in
the
light,”
as
he
put
it.
and,
the
un
case
and
other
cases
which
are
relied
on
by
my
brothers
are
all
cases
where
there
was
a
prima
facie
showing
in
a
courtroom.
a
grand
jury
charge
is
not
prima
facie.
in
the
first
place,
it’s
only
accusatory.
it’s
not
even
admissible
nor
can
it
be
referred
to
in
a
trial.
secondly,
it
can
well
involve
incompetent
evidence,
as
this
court
recently
decided,
and
it’s
totally
inappropriate
to
suggest
that
a
president
who
otherwise
would
have
a
very
valuable
privilege
and
i
think
i
should
emphasize
the
value
of
these
privileges
because
it
is
a
valuable
privilege.
all
you
have
to
do
is
read
justice
reed’s
decision
in
kaiser
aluminum
when
he
spells
it
out
quite
clearly
the
importance
and
value
of
this
privilege
to
simply
say
to
have
a
grand
jury
make
a
charge
that
destroys
that
privilege
is
an
argument
that
i
don’t
think
can
be
sustained.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
right.
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
don’t
believe
that
simply
because
the
constitution
does
not
explicitly
state
immunity,
as
it
does
in
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
should
this
court
hold
it
does
not
exist
in
criminal
matters.
i
would
like
to
make
one
point
with
the
court
however,
because
i’m
sure
the
point
will
be
raised
concerning
justice
carr
for
example.
there
is
a
distinct
difference,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief
as
we
view
it,
between
a
president
of
the
united
states,
a
single
individual
in
who
the
entire
executive
function
is
vested.
a
president
serves
7
days
a
week
24
hours
a
day,
and
only
he
or
those
under
him
performing
his
functions
can
exercise
the
executive
function
of
our
government.
now,
if
a
congressman
or
a
senator
or
even
a
judge
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
or
a
vice
president
is
removed
from
his
duties,
matters
go
on.
but
a
president
doesn’t
have
that
opportunity
to
take
a
vacation
and
it’s
vested
in
one
individual
and
deliberately
so.
mr.
james
st.
clair
we
say
it’s
a
constitutional
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
correct.
i
think
so.
i
would
want
to
the
point
with
you
that
we
think
the
privilege
we’re
arguing
for
is
both
common
law
and
constitution.
mr.
james
st.
clair
it’s
constitutional
because
it’s
inherent
in
the
executive
power.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and
it’s
common
law
because
it
has
always
existed.
mr.
james
st.
clair
it
has
to
do
with
these
questions
of
immunity.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
my
brother
seems
to
think
it
does
because
they
say,
because
of
the
implications
of
criminality
here
the
president
has
lost
something
he
otherwise
would
not
have
had.
mr.
james
st.
clair
please
do.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
i
think
if
a
higher
privilege
has
been
accorded,
it
should
not.
but
in
any
event,
the
privilege
of
confidentiality
is
not
unimportant.
however,
let
me
direct
myself
to
your
question.
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no
one
knows.
mr.
james
st.
clair
you
won’t
know
until
you
listen
to
these
tapes
as
to
what
subjects
are
discussed.
my
brother
can
only
state
that
it’s
probable
they
relate,
at
least
in
part,
to
whatever
he
says,
watergate.
or
it’s
likely
that
it
might.
and,
i
have
had
the
experience
for
exempt
where
circumstances
were
such
that
the
house
committee
felt
that
it
was
likely
that
a
conversation
took
place
between
the
attorney
general,
mr.
mitchell,
and
the
president
regarding
plans
for
surveillance
of
democratic
parties.
when
you
look
at
the
conversation,
it
wasn’t
there
at
all.
mr.
james
st.
clair
so,
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
nor
does
the
prosecutor
know
what
additional
matters
may
be
interwoven
into
these
conversations.
one
thing
is
certain.
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
and
no
representation
could
be
made
to
the
contrary
either.
mr.
james
st.
clair
if
this
court
finds
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
that’s
right.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and
the
president
presumably,
if
he
were
to
comply
with
that
order,
would
make
such
a
representation
in
an
appropriate
case.
but
the
fundamental
point
is
we
believe
the
reason
stated
that
the
president’s
right
to
confidential
advice
is
important
and
it’s
actually
fundamental
to
the
proper
function
of
his
government
and
in
many
instances,
as
i
suggested,
even
more
important
in
military
matters
or
matters
of
state,
so
to
speak,
because
no
matter
what
the
conversation
is
of
course
it’s
the
fact
that
it
might
become
public
that
involves
them
this
chilling
effect
we’ve
made
reference
to
in
our
brief
under
the
first
amendment
but
as
a
practical
matter.
and,
i
can
see
it
myself.
the
communications
are
not
free
and
open
because
who
is
to
say
that
it
won’t
be
becalmed
before
a
grand
jury?
and,
most
everyone
in
the
white
house
has
been
becalmed
before
a
grand
jury,
sometimes
several
times.
the
fbi
has
interviewed
every
secretary
that
has
any
knowledge
of
any
aspect
of
this
case.
this
prosecutor
has
a
plethora
of
information.
he
says
he
wants
to
try
this
case
with
all
the
evidence,
so
he
knows
better
than
that.
nobody
tries
any
case
with
all
the
evidence.
you’d
be
buried
in
minutia.
you
select
the
evidence
that
you
think
most
appropriate
to
your
case.
you
don’t
try
it
with
all
the
evidence.
and
this
special
prosecutor
has
mountains
of
information.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
correct,
not
the
court.
and
if
that
evidence
constitutes
presidential
confidential
communication,
and
i
suggest
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
president
determines
that.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
i
suggest
that’s
probably
the
fact
here.
so,
when
my
brother
says
“i
don’t
need
this
evidence
to
win
these
cases
in
my
opinion,
but
i
need
them
so
i
can
present
all
the
evidence,”
i’ve
been
trying
cases
long
enough
to
know
and
so
does
he
that’s
not
what
he’s
really
after.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
burden
under
17c
is
clearly
on
the
prosecution
and
the
burden
in
clearly
on
the
prosecution
on
every
other
aspect.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
i
suggest
whatever
was
considered
by
this
court
in
reynolds
to
be
enough
is
more
than
enough
in
this
case.
we
have
the
testimony
of
every
individual
involved.
a
number
of
them
have
pled
guilty.
dean
has
pled
guilty.
colson
has
pled
guilty.
comeback
has
pled
guilt,
etcetera,
etcetera.
all
under
plea
bargains
where
they
are
under
obligation
to
fully
cooperate.
this
prosecutor
is
not,
nor
does
he
say
at
any
point
that
he
needs
this
information
to
prosecute
successfully
these
cases.
mr.
james
st.
clair
then
the
president
wins,
in
my
view.
mr.
james
st.
clair
because
the
prosecutor
cannot
show
that
the
evidence
he
seeks
is
relevant
and
admissible.
mr.
james
st.
clair
because
of
the
nature
of
the
circumstance,
he
doesn’t
know
what’s
in
there.
mr.
james
st.
clair
but
you’d
have
to
know
what
the
matter
was
or
what
the
issues
in
the
case
were.
but
under
bowman
and
iozia,
it’s
not
enough
to
show
that
it
probably
is
or
it
might
be
or
is
likely
to
be.
it
must
be
shown
to
be
relevant
and
must
be
shown
to
be
admissible.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
why
it’s
not
a
third
party
scheme.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
if
you
want
to
utilize
the
17c,
then
i
suggest
that’s
what
you
have
to
do.
mr.
james
st.
clair
as
a
prosecutor,
that’s
right.
as
a
grand
jury,
that’s
another
matter.
if
he
had
brought
--
sought
this
under
a
grand
jury
subpoena,
we
would
then
be
directly
faced
with
nixon
against
sirica
which
we
happen
to
think
was
improperly
and
incorrectly
decided.
but
under
17c,
we
are
dealing
with
the
prosecutor’s
subpoena.
the
evidence
of
decided
cases
makes
it
quite
clear
there
must
be
a
specific
showing
of
relevance
and
admissibility.
now,
if
he
can’t
do
it
because
of
the
nature
of
the
matter
then
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
his
problem,
not
mine.
mr.
james
st.
clair
most
of
those
cases
are
but
there
is
at
least
one
case,
i
think
it’s
grossman,
that
says
the
rules
are
equally
applicable
to
the
prosecution.
it’s
cited
in
one
of
the
footnotes
in
our
brief.
but,
the
17c
subpoena
is
conceptually
a
subpoena
for
known
information.
conceptually,
if
the
prosecutor
is
looking
for
things,
he
should
utilize
a
grand
jury
subpoena.
in
that
case,
i
think
in
bowman,
they
wanted
the
prosecutor
to
produce
each
document
he
was
going
to
use
in
the
presentation
of
his
case.
that’s
specific.
it’s
obviously
relevant
and
admissible.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
correct,
and
certainly
not
under
these
circumstance.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
think
it
is
the
practice.
i
think
that
the
grand
jury
practice
is
far
greater
than
perhaps
the
constitution
has
envisioned.
it’s
really
used
today,
frankly,
as
an
effective
discovery
tool.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
quite
clearly,
under
the
analogy
that
was
provided,
i
may.
mr.
james
st.
clair
quite
clearly
so.
the
simple
reason,
sir
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
i’m
sorry.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
answer,
sir,
is
that
criminal
conspiracy
is
criminal
only
after
it’s
proven
to
be
criminal,
and
we’re
not
at
that
point
yet.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that
is,
the
case
has
been
tried
and
defense
found
guilty.
mr.
james
st.
clair
but
the
fact
that
one
defendant
confessed
does
not
make
the
other
defendant
guilty.
mr.
james
st.
clair
first
of
all,
the
answer
is
yes
even
if
it
is
criminal
but,
more
importantly,
it
is
yes
because
criminality
is
something
that
is
not
necessarily
determined
at
the
time
that
you
must
resolve
the
issue.
and,
that
you
should
not
destroy
he
privilege
in
the
anticipation
of
a
later
finding
of
criminality
which
may
never
come
to
pass.
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
a
number
of
these
defendants
will
be
found
innocent
and
in
fact,
in
theory,
they
are
innocent
right
now.
mr.
james
st.
clair
to
avail
the
president,
if
your
honor
please,
of
the
free
and
untrammeled
source
of
information
and
advice
without
the
thought
or
fear
that
it
may
be
reviewed
at
some
later
time
when
some
grand
jury,
in
this
case,
or
some
other
reason
suggest
there
is
criminality.
for
example,
it’s
very
important—i’m
sorry.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
in
the
president’s
discretion,
he
did
that.
and,
it’s
a
discretionary
matter.
but,
for
example,
the
simple
matter
of
appointment,
if
i
may,
an
appointment
of
a
judge.
it’s
very
important
to
the
judiciary
to
have
good
judges.
it’s
not
at
all
unheard
of
for
lawyers
to
be
asked
their
opinion
about
a
nominee.
now,
if
that
lawyer
wants
to
be
sure
that
he’s
going
to
be
protected
in
giving
candid
opinions
regarding
a
nominee
for
the
bench,
it’s
absolutely
essential
that
that
be
protected.
otherwise,
you’re
not
going
to
get
candid
advice.
now,
this
isn’t
a
state
secret.
it
isn’t
national
defense.
i
suggest
it’s
more
important
because
that
judge
may
sit
on
that
bench
for
30
years.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i’m
sorry,
sir.
i
didn’t
understand
your
question.
mr.
james
st.
clair
absolutely.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
would
think
that
that
could
not
be
released
if
it
were
a
confidential
communication.
if
the
president
did
appoint
such
an
individual,
the
remedy
is
clear.
the
remedy
is
he
should
be
impeached.
let
me
give
you
this
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
if
you
know
about
it,
then
you
can
state
the
case.
if
you
don’t
know
about
it,
you
never
had
it.
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
james
st.
clair
this
is
i
think
what
was
suggested
in
the
seaborg
case
where
the
court
said
“gee!
if
that’s
so,
then
floyd
could
be
all
covered
over
and
so
forth.”
human
experience
is
not
demonstrated
and
that’s
a
fact.
very
few
things
forever
are
hidden.
secondly,
however,
this
case
is
not
that
case.
as
i
pointed
out,
there
is
a
plethora
of
information.
this
is
not
a
case
where
there
is
no
information.
if
anything,
there
is
more
than
enough.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that
is
suggested
by
my
brothers.
mr.
james
st.
clair
my
brother
suggests
a
waiver,
but
this
privilege
is
not
like
fifth
amendment
privilege
or
attorney-client
privilege
where
if
you
let
out
one
word,
you’d
lost
the
whole
thing.
that
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
it.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
public
policy
requires
as
much
publicity
as
the
president
in
his
discretion
determines
would
be
appropriate
and
the
more
information,
the
better.
and
if
you
require
--
if
you
rule
that
one
utterance
constitutes
a
waiver,
you’re
not
going
to
get
it.
you’re
not
going
to
have
that
thing.
this
is
a
discretionary
privilege
that
the
constitution,
by
implication
of
necessity,
and
history
has
shown
is
inherent
in
the
executive
function
as,
indeed,
it
is
in
other
functions.
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief
similar
examples
of
the
legislature
insisting
upon
such
a
privilege
even
against
subpoenas
from
courts,
executives,
and
the
courts
themselves.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
know
i
am.
i
do
appreciate
being
reminded
of
that
and
i
think
i
would
preserve
of
which
i
think
is
10
more
minutes.
mr.
james
st.
clair
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
in
response
to
my
brother’s
most
recent
argument,
of
course
sawyer
was
an
important
case
with
political
implications.
of
course,
the
other
cases
were
in
it
of
themselves
important
cases
with
political
implications.
but,
this
case
is
different
in
that
the
decision
in
this
case
will
have
an
undeniable
impact
on
another
proceeding
in
another
proceeding
which
the
constitution
says
is
essentially
a
political
proceeding
from
which
the
court
is
excluded.
and
for
this
court
to
be
drawn
into
that
thicket,
if
i
may
call
it
that,
seems
to
me
highly
inappropriate
at
least
at
this
time.
as
i
indicated
at
the
outset,
the
house
committee
has
made
certain
political
decisions.
the
president
has
made
certain
political
decisions.
they
will
each
have
to
bear
the
responsibility
of
those
decisions
with
the
american
people.
this
court
should
not
impair,
interfere
with,
or
otherwise
participate
directly
or
indirectly
in
that
proceeding.
and,
it’s
inevitable
it
would
happen.
this
courtroom
wouldn’t
be
full
today
if
this
were
simply
a
suit
on
a
subpoena
brought
by
the
special
prosecutor
against
the
president
even
though
that
would
be
an
important
political
matter
because
the
president
is
involved.
but,
this
is
important
for
other
reasons
quite
apart
from
that.
other
reasons
which
i
suggest
indicate
quite
clearly
that
this
court
ought
to,
in
its
discretion
and
in
its
judgment,
stay
its
hand
at
least
until
such
time
as
those
proceedings
have
run
their
course
because
those
are
political
decisions
being
made.
they
should
not
bear
the
burden
either
way
of
a
judicial
decision.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that
would
not
be
the
first
time,
mr.
justice
douglas,
that
a
criminal
trial
was
delayed.
and
in
balancing
the
importance
to
this
nation,
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
clearly
indicated
and
i
don’t
believe
the
defendants
would
be
crying
very
bitter
tears.
but
in
any
event,
the
justiciability
of
this
case,
seems
to
be,
the
single
important
obvious
matter
that
my
brother
would
prefer
not
much
to
talk
about,
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it.
if
you
read
page
59
in
his
brief,
he
says
“he,
the
president,
is
now
the
subject
of
an
impeachment
inquiry
by
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
subpoenaed
evidence
may
have
a
material
bearing
on
whether
he
is
impeached
and,
if
impeached,
whether
he
is
convicted
and
removed
from
office.”
and,
i
suggest
the
constitution
in
all
of
the
history,
the
framers
makes
it
quite
clear
that
the
framers
conceived
impeachment
as
a
legislative
process.
the
court
was
excluded
specifically
from
that
function.
marbury
against
madison,
itself,
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice
that
it
decided
the
case
in
favor
of
the
president.
the
rule
was
discharged
and
the
commission
was
not
issued.
but
it
also
helps,
and
it’s
been
the
law
since
that
case,
that
the
courts
will
not
interfere
with
or
direct
a
discretionary
act
on
the
part
of
the
president
or
any
other
branch
of
government,
and
that’s
been
confirmed
in
mississippi
against
johnson
and
any
case
since
that
time.
and,
the
discretion
that
the
constitution
by
implication
and
by
necessity
that
has
been
vested
in
the
president
in
determining
which
of
his
confidential
communications
shall
be
made
public
or
released
is
a
discretionary
act
that
this
court
ought
not
by
its
decision
to
undertake
to
do
for
him
because
this
court
is
not
equipped
in
knowledge,
background,
or
in
any
other
way
to
exercise
that
discretion
for
the
president
of
the
united
states.
this
is
not
a
ministerial
act.
finally,
i
observe
a
slight
but
significant
shift
in
my
brother’s
position
with
respect
to
the
prima
facie
nature
of
naming
of
the
president
as
a
co-conspirator.
i
say
it
can
be
made
now
that
it
can
be
made
prima
facie,
i
take
it,
that
is
by
examining
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
evidence
in
fact
supports
that
determination.
we
have
invited
this
court
and
judge
sirica
to
do
just
that.
the
special
prosecutor
has
opposed
in
each
instance
this
or
any
other
court
looking
behind
that
to
see
whether,
in
fact,
the
evidence
can
be
made
as
he
now
states
a
position
to
support
a
charge
of
criminality.
before
the
argument,
the
argument
was
that
because
it
was
a
finding
or
a
vote,
it
was
prima
facie.
now
it
is,
i
take
it,
somewhat
different.
but
in
any
event,
an
action
by
a
grand
jury
purporting
to
assess
criminality
to
a
president
of
the
united
states
is
a
clear
intrusion
upon
the
legislative
function
and
power
with
respect
to
impeachment.
as
i
said
earlier,
the
president
is
not
above
the
law
nor
does
he
contend
that
he
is,
but
he
does
contend
that,
as
president,
the
law
can
be
applied
to
him
in
only
one
way
and
that’s
by
impeachment,
not
by
naming
as
a
co-conspirator
in
a
grand
jury
indictment,
not
by
indictment,
or
any
other
way.
therefore,
in
this
case,
i
urge
that
this
court
take
such
action
as
is
appropriate
and
overrule
judge
sirica’s
decision
and
order
that
this
case
be
dismissed.
mr.
james
st.
clair
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
my
learning
brothers
approached
this
case
i
think
in
the
traditional
point
of
view,
namely,
this
is
an
attempt
by
a
special
prosecutor
to
obtain
what
he
thinks
is
desirable
evidence
in
a
criminal
prosecution
that
he
has
a
responsibility
for.
not
once,
however,
did
i
heard
him
mention
what
i
think
is
really
involved,
at
least
in
a
significant
part
and
that
is
the
co-pendency
of
the
impeachment
proceedings
before
the
house
of
representatives.
and,
the
realistic
fusion
that
has
taken
place
with
respect
to
these
two
proceedings
and
the
promise
of
continued
fusion,
as
i
understand
my
brother’s
position.
may
i
quote
from
page
50
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
think,
sir,
they
really
are.
first,
by
way
of
factual
background
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
st.
clair
right,
and
the
court
shall
not
be
used
to
implement
or
aid
that
process
which
what
has
happened
in
this
case.
this
case
wouldn’t
be
here
on
july
8.
mr.
james
st.
clair
alright
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
would
like
to
review
some
of
the
facts
for
you
in
this
regard.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
my
brother
has
mentioned
them
to
you.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
exactly
right,
sir.
not
only
that,
it
makes
the
case
unjusticiable
at
least.
now
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
the
case
should
be
dismissed,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
then
i
would
retract
what
i
said.
this
case
should
be
dismissed.[laughter]
mr.
james
st.
clair
alright.
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
sir.
i’m
talking
about
the
proceeding
before
the
district
court
through
the
court
of
appeals
to
this
court.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
as
i
say,
i
think
this
case
should
be
dismissed.
mr.
james
st.
clair
set
aside.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
right,
yes.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
agree.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
right.
that’s
why
i’m
trying
to
get
across
to
this
court,
perhaps
on
our
plea,
this
case
should
be
disposed
of,
be
it
by
vacating
the
order
below
or
not.
but,
in
any
event,
it
is
improper
in
our
view
that
this
case
should
be
heard
in
the
context
it
is
now
being
heard.
we
wouldn’t
be
here
on
july
8
before
a
crowded
courtroom
if
it
was
not
recognized
generally.
mr.
james
st.
clair
exactly
right.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and,
therefore,
it’s
a
non-justiciable
issue
in
this
and
in
the
district
court.
what
has
happened
in
this
case
is
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
believe
we
argued
a
non-justiciability
argument.
yes,
sir.
i
know
we
did,
but
if
you’re
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
in
this
context
at
this
time,
sir.
what
has
happened
is
this.
as
you
know,
on
february
24,
a
grand
jury
secretly
named
the
president
among
others
as
an
unindicted
co-conspirator.
that
fact
was
not
made
known.
on
march
1,
an
indictment
was
returned
against
a
number
of
the
president’s
chief
aids.
coincident
with
that
in
an
open
courtroom,
the
assistant
prosecutor,
special
prosecutor,
handed
up
to
the
judge
a
bag
together
with
a
sealed
letter
requesting
that
this
material
be
sent
over
to
the
house
of
representatives.
the
president
took
no
position
regarding
that
proposal
because
he
considered
it
to
be
probably
appropriate,
under
the
belief
that
there
was
nothing
accusatory
in
that
material.
judge
sirica,
himself,
reviewed
the
material,
found
nothing
accusatory
and
said
it
would
therefore
be
quite
appropriate
to
send
this
material
to
the
house
of
representatives
not
realizing
and
not
knowing
that
the
special
prosecutor
had
previously
obtained
a
secret
chart
against
the
president
and
others
which
was
definitely
accusatory.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
material
was
turned
over.
it
was
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
james
st.
clair
a
grand
jury
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
it
was
not.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
material
was
sent
to
the
house
of
representatives
in
the
belief
that
it
was
non-accusatory
in
nature.
it
was
simply
a
recital
of
facts.
mr.
james
st.
clair
but
the
--mr.
jaworski
had
available
to
him,
unknown
to
the
judge
and
unknown
to
counsel
for
the
president,
a
secret
indictment
naming
the
president
as
a
co-conspirator.
the
accusatory
part
followed
later.
mr.
james
st.
clair
by
a
newspaper
leak.
mr.
james
st.
clair
it
didn’t
have
to
be.
all
they
had
to
do
was
read
the
newspaper.
there
can
be
no
question
about
it.
and
therefore,
i
say,
this
case
has
to
be
viewed
realistically
in
the
context
that
it
is
now
being
heard.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
think
it
would’ve
been
quite
appropriate
because
the
judge’s
decision
was
based
on
the
proposition
there
was
nothing
accusatory.
that,
under
the
circumstances,
absolute
fairness
was
appropriate
and
required
in
so
far
as
the
president
was
concerned.
no
one
could
argue
that
the
indictment
as
a
co-conspirator
or
naming
as
a
co-conspirator
does
anything
but
impair
the
president’s
position
before
the
house
of
representatives.
that
should,
in
my
judgment,
have
been
made
known
to
the
judge.
i
don’t
know
what
he
would’ve
done
under
those
circumstances.
his
decision
was
based
solidly
on
the
proposition
there
was
nothing
accusatory
in
the
material.
now,
my
brother
says
in
his
brief
that
this
material
he
now
seeks,
of
course,
would
be
available
to
the
house
committee
and
will
be
used
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
president
should
be
impeached.
so,
this
fusion
is
going
to
continue.
and
under
the
constitution,
as
we
view
it,
only
the
legislature
has
the
right
to
conduct
impeachment
proceedings.
the
courts
have
been,
from
the
history
involved
and
from
the
language
of
the
provisions,
excluded
from
that
function.
and,
yet,
the
special
prosecutor
is
drawing
this
court
in
to
those
proceedings
inevitably
and
inexorably.
no
one
could
stand
here
and
argue
with
any
candor
that
the
decision
of
this
court
would
have
no
impact
whatsoever
on
the
pending
inquiry
before
the
house
of
representatives
concerning
the
impeachment
of
the
president.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
would
not
say
that.
i
don’t
think
he
could
be
necessarily
subpoenaed.
i
don’t
think
the
president
is
subject
to
the
process
of
the
court,
unless
he
so
determines
he
would
give
evidence.
but,
the
murder
would
have
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
in
this
case
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
justice
stewart,
i’m
not.
the
subject
matter
--
these
two
matters,
is
the
same
subject
matter.
mr.
james
st.
clair
should
the
president
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
right.
mr.
james
st.
clair
right.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
say
it
should
not
go
forward
a
this
time,
at
the
very
least,
because
the
subject
matter
being
inquired
of
in
the
large
measure
before
the
house
committee
is
exactly
the
same
subject
matter
being
involved
in
this
argument.
mr.
james
st.
clair
namely,
should
the
president
produce
tapes?
should
he
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
not
stand
on
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
pardon?
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
if
your
honor
please,
the
house
of
representatives
have
subpoenaed
these
and
more
tapes.
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
i
don’t.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
i
don
know
that
there’s
a
preliminary
showing
that
they
re
conversations
between
the
president
and
his
close
aids,
and
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
regardless
of
what
it
is
and
may
involve
a
number
of
subjects.
mr.
james
st.
clair
he
claims
that,
but
he
has
no
way
of
showing
it.
in
fact,
he
says
it’s
only
probable
or
likely.
there
is
no
way
of
showing
that
they,
in
fact,
involve
the
subjects
of
watergate.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
presume
that’s
so
and
he
would
then
--
it
would
be
made
available
to
the
special
prosecutor.
the
special
prosecutor
says
that,
of
course,
this
would
then
become
part
of
the
impeachment
proceedings,
and
here
we
are.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that
is
quite
correct.
mr.
james
st.
clair
really,
it’s
a
matter
of
accommodation
not
as
a
matter
of
assertion
of
a
right
of
one
branch
over
another.
but
the
point
i
want
to
make,
justice
burger,
is
that
the
same
subject
matter
is
inexorably
involved
in
both
proceedings,
now
proceeding
on
at
the
same
time.
and,
the
house
of
representatives
has
not
sought
the
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
that’s
a
very
good
question
i’d
like
to
answer.
the
decisions
that
are
made
in
an
impeachment
proceeding,
justice
marshall,
are
essentially
political
decisions.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
we
will
because
they’ve
already
been
made
public.
mr.
james
st.
clair
we
are
--
as
soon
as
a
judge
approves
some
method
of
validating
the
accuracy
of
these
tapes,
they
can
have
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
they
can
have
the
tapes,
but
you
have
to
understand.
the
tape
is
a
part
of
a
reel.
a
reel
may
cover
a
dozen
conversations.
so,
there’s
a
mechanical
problem
of
trying
to
validate
or
be
sure
that
this
is
correct
but
it’s
only
a
mechanical
problem.
but
once
that’s
solved,
subject
to
the
judge
bellow’s
approval,
they
have
the
availability
of
that
but
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
we
think
so.
that’s
why
we
made
them.
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
say
this.
i
say
the
president
should
decide
as
a
political
matter
of
what
should
be
made
available
to
the
house,
that
the
court
ought
not
to
be
drawn
into
that
decision.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
house
takes
a
different
view.
the
house
has
subpoenaed
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
145
tapes,
and
that’s
a
political
decision.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
president
has
not
honored
any
of
the
subpoenas
other
than
the
first
one
issued
by
the
house,
so
that
there
is
a
dispute
in
the
house
now
between
the
president
and
the
committee
on
the
judiciary.
it’s
essentially
a
political
dispute.
it’s
a
dispute
that
this
court
ought
not
to
be
drawn
into
and
this
result
of
a
decision
in
this
case
would
inexorably
result
in
being
brought
into
it.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
impact
of
a
decision
in
this
case,
undeniably,
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
my
view
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
cannot
have
--
it
will
not
be
overlooked.
mr.
james
st.
clair
what
i
would
think
would
be
inappropriate
thing
to
do
at
this
time
because
there
is
pending
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
i
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
will
argue
that
in
a
moment,
but
i’m
arguing
now
that
you
should
not.
i’m
arguing
now,
sir,
only
that
you
should
not
because
it
would
involve
this
court
inexorably
in
a
political
process
which
has
been
determined
by
the
constitution
to
be
solely
the
function
of
the
legislative
branch.
and,
it
cannot
be
that
the
impact
of
the
court’s
decision
in
this
matter,
which
is
one
of
the
principle
matters
now
pending
before
the
house,
would
be
overlooked.
it
would
certainly,
as
a
matter
of
realistic
fact,
to
have
a
significant
impact.
mr.
james
st.
clair
mr.
justice
douglas,
we
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
it
may.
the
brady
issue,
we
don’t
believe,
is
properly
before
the
court
and
ha
not
been
briefed
by
us
nor
by
my
brother.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and
was
not
decided
by
the
district
court.
i
would
only
say
this,
that
in
the
experience
that
i’ve
had
in
connection
with
cases
tried
such
as
the
stan
mitchell
case
in
new
york,
the
chapman
case
in
washington,
the
ehrlichman
case
now
going
on.
there
has
never
been
a
claim
that
the
president
has
not
made
available
appropriate
and
adequate
brady
material.
but,
i
don’t
believe
it’s
before
this
court
at
this
time,
what
is
before
this
court
is
a
prosecutor’s
demand
for
evidence.
and
may
i
direct
my
regards
for
a
moment
to
that
problem.
he
says
that,
in
effect,
we
have
no
right
to
be
here.
we
have
delegated
the
who,
the
when,
and
with
what
issues
to
him.
we
have
delegated
the
who
and
the
when.
and,
pursuant
to
that,
he
has
indicted
a
number
of
people
and
he
has
indicted
him
as
such
time
as
he
thought
appropriate.
but,
even
he
concedes
that
we
did
not
delegate
to
him
what
presidential
conversations
would
be
used
as
evidence.
that
was
reserved,
and
he
concedes
that
that
is
the
fact
and
that’s
what
is
at
issue
here.
not
when
and
who
is
to
is
to
be
indicted,
but
what
presidential
communications
are
going
to
be
used
as
evidence?
and
that’s
what
the
issue
is
in
this
case.
mr.
james
st.
clair
two
or
three
days.
mr.
james
st.
clair
it’s
my
argument
and
the
fact.
for
example,
in
the
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
they
have
been
screened
out
in
the
transcripts.
whatever
has
been
published
to
the
public,
we
are
quite
prepared
to
verify
the
accuracy
of.
in
the
course
of
those
transcripts,
there
are
first
portions
left
out.
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
we
simply
published
the
portion
of
that
conversation
that
did
not
relate
to
that
with
a
notation
that
a
portion
has
been
left
out.
mr.
james
st.
clair
it
was
let
out
because
it
did
not
involve
presidential
action
as
it
related
to
watergate
or
something
to
that
effect.
we
did
not
disclose
the
substance
of
that
left
out
material.
mr.
james
st.
clair
there
might
well
be
such
a
reason.
my
proper
to
my
brother
has
been
that
we
will
verify
the
accuracy
of
the
printed
transcript.
so,
this
1,240
odd
pages
of
presidential
conversations
that
are
available
to
the
public
and
available
to
him
will
be
usable
in
the
trial.
now,
this
may
well
involve
a
mechanism
approved
by
the
court
involving
counsel
for
the
defendants
to
be
satisfied.
so,
they’re
satisfied
that
the
copy
is
accurate.
but,
this
all
have
to
be
expurgated
out
of
a
reel
of
tape
that
may
involve
several
days’
conversations.
mr.
james
st.
clair
but
it’s
essentially
a
mechanical
problem.
mr.
james
st.
clair
other
than
the
20
that
are
already
published,
no
effort
has
been
made
as
yet,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
because,
if
your
honor
please,
we
haven’t
felt
that
it
has
been
necessary
to
do
so
because
we
firmly
feel
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
that
the
president
has
every
right
to
refuse
to
do
so.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
we
move
to
quash
it.
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
sir,
we
didn’t.
we
moved
to
quash
it.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and
we
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
if
your
honor
please,
we
are
submitting
the
matter
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
to
this
court,
under
a
special
appearance
on
behalf
of
the
president.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
yes,
in
a
sense.
mr.
james
st.
clair
in
a
sense.
mr.
james
st.
clair
in
the
sense
that
this
court
has
an
obligation
to
determine
the
law,
alright?
the
president
also
has
an
obligation
to
carry
out
his
constitutional
functions.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
probably,
the
question
is
even
more
limited
than
that.
is
the
executive
privilege,
which
my
brother
concedes,
absolute
or
is
it
only
conditional?
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
this
is
being
submitted
to
this
court
for
its
guidance
and
judgment
with
respect
to
the
law.
the
president,
on
the
other
hand,
has
his
obligations
under
the
constitution.
mr.
james
st.
clair
as
to
what
the
law
is,
yes,
of
course.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
would
not
be
here.
now,
my
brother
says
i
have
no
right
to
even
challenge
his
right
to
be
here,
and
i’d
like
to
deal
with
that
for
a
moment.
this
is,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
essentially
an
executive
department
matter.
whatever
may
have
been
the
arrangements
between
the
branches
of
the
executive
matter
with
respect
to
evidentiary
matters,
and
in
fact
there
were
no
arrangements
regarding
evidentiary
matters,
it
is
not
the
function
of
the
court
to
direct
or
rule
what
evidence
will
be
presented
to
it
by
the
executive
and
that
executives
dully
prosecute
it.
if
this
was
a
united
states
attorney,
this
case
wouldn’t
be
here,
of
course.
it’s
here
only
because
certain
things
were
delegated
to
the
special
prosecutor.
but,
the
special
prosecutor
was
not
delegated
the
right
to
tell
the
president
one
of
his
conversations
are
going
to
be
made
available
as
evidence.
that
was
specifically
reserved
and
the
only
thing
that
my
brother
can
do
is
argue
about
it,
and
that’s
what
he’s
doing
right
here
today.
and,
therefore
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
the
united
states
attorney
would
be
directed.
mr.
james
st.
clair
by
the
president
or
the
attorney
general
at
the
direction
of
the
president.
mr.
james
st.
clair
by
the
attorney
general
at
the
direction
of
the
president.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
think
so,
but
most
cases
don’t
involve
presidential
conversations.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
think
that’s
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
with
all
due
respect.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
president
says
to
the
attorney
general
“i’m
not
going
to
produce
this
material.”
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
right.
mr.
james
st.
clair
in
my
view,
the
president
would
instruct
the
attorney
general
to
instruct
the
united
states
attorney
to
withdraw
his
motion.
mr.
james
st.
clair
then
we’d
have
a
new
united
states
attorney.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
i
made
a
little
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
think
that
united
states
attorney,
in
all
respect,
would
and
should
be
removed
from
that
case.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
executive
power
of
the
government
is
not
vested
in
the
united
states
attorney.
it’s
vested
in
one
man,
and
that
man
is
the
president
of
the
united
states.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
but
that
statute,
which
my
brother
cites
in
his
brief
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
does
not
deprive
nor
could
it
deprive
the
president
of
his
constitutional
authority
to
be
the
chief
law
enforcement
officer.
he
shall
take
care
to
se
that
the
law
is
enforced.
the
executive
power
is
vested
in
him,
in
one
man.
and,
the
attorney
general
is
nothing
but
a
surrogate
for
the
president
of
the
united
states.
mr.
james
st.
clair
perhaps
as
to
everything
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
right.
mr.
james
st.
clair
perhaps,
with
respect
to
everything
except,
the
president
did
not
delegate
to
the
special
prosecutor
the
right
to
tell
him
whether
or
not
his
confidential
communication
should
be
made
available
as
evidence.
so
that,
within
the
package
of
executive
power
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
normally
represented
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
normally
represented
by
the
executive
department
as
to
who
shall
be
prosecutor
that’s
been
delegated
to
this
gentleman.
he
has
exercised
that
power.
when:
he’s
done
that,
with
what
evidence:
he’s
done
that
as
we’ll
deal
with
in
a
few
moments.
but,
not
with
that
portion
of
the
evidence
that’s
available
that
constitutes
presidential
confidential
communication.
that’s
been
specifically
reserved.
and
the
special
prosecutor
cannot,
and
even
if
the
president
did
give
him
that
authority,
probably
could
not,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
delegate
that.
but
in
any
event,
he
did
not
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
right
to
order
the
president
to
give
up
confidential
communications.
that
was
not
delegated.
mr.
james
st.
clair
right,
and
the
president,
under
no
circumstances,
gave
up
any
of
his
defenses
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and
i’m
making
them
right
now.
and
even
if
we
did
agree
between
us
that
we
would
vest
this
court
with
jurisdiction
simply
because
of
the
politics
of
the
situation,
this
court
in
its
decisions
would
not
accept
the
vesting
of
such
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
st.
clair
because
this
court
determines
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
parties
can
agree
that
it
hasn’t
but—
mr.
james
st.
clair
if
it
goes
that
far.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
right.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
think
not
in
the
terms
of
separation
of
powers,
if
i
may.
my
brother’s
point
of
view
is,
he
views
himself
as
the
united
states
as
distinguished
from
a
member
of
the
executive
branch.
and,
in
his
brief,
he
invokes
the
united
states
is
really
a
fourth
entity.
mr.
james
st.
clair
constitutionally,
a
special
prosecutor
with
the
powers
that
my
brother
suggests
he
has
is
a
constitutional
anomaly.
we
have
only
three
branches,
not
three-and-a
third
or
three-and-a
half
or
four.
there’s
only
one
executive
branch
and
the
executive
power
is
vested
in
a
president.
now
if,
for
political
reasons,
the
president
wants
to
dole
out
some
of
those
powers,
he
may
so
do
and
has
done
in
this
case.
but,
he
cannot
vest
jurisdiction
on
a
court
that,
otherwise,
the
court
would
not
have
nor
should
the
court
accept
jurisdiction.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that
is
correct,
and
he
has
not
been
dismissed.
mr.
james
st.
clair
nor
is
he
likely
to
be
dismissed.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
point
is,
if
i
may
make
it,
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
the
president
gave
up
his
right
to
protect
the
confidentiality
of
his
conversations.
mr.
james
st.
clair
no
claim
is
made
that
he
did.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and
my
brother
concedes.[laughter]
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
what
we
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
if
we
get
beyond
the
subject
matter
situation.
now,
if
this
were
the
nixon
against
sirica
case
where
you
didn’t
have
what
i
think
is
a
dispositive
problem
in
this
case,
namely,
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
judicial
branch
to
determine
this
intra-executive
branch
if
we
had
a
grand
jury
subpoena,
as
was
true
in
the
nixon
against
sirica
case.
then,
you
have
intra-branch
and
the
court
would
have
a
better
standing
in
its
responsibility
to
see
the
grand
juries
which
are
under
its
jurisdiction
to
have
such
evidence
as
they
thought
appropriate.
but,
we’re
well
beyond
that
stage.
17c
requires
a
great,
much
more
restricted
form
of
evidence
that’s
got
to
be
relevant
and
admissible.
it’s
nothing
like
a
grand
jury
subpoena.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
i
don’t
think
that
the
controller
general
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
represents,
if
your
honor
please,
that
basic
constitutional
structure
has
been
changed.
it
may
be
that
he
has
executive
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
and
he
may
have
legislative
functions.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
understand.
he
is
created
by
a
legislative,
very
much
like
a
semi-independent
agency.
in
one
aspect,
he’s
an
agent
of
the
legislature.
in
the
other
aspect,
he’s
an
agent
of
the
executive.
but,
we
don’t
have
any
more
than
legislative,
judicial,
and
executive
branches.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
i’m
sure
the
court
couldn’t.
i’m
not
too
clear
about
the
president
under
the
myers
case.
i
really
haven’t
thought
that
much
of
it.
it
could
be
that
he
could
be
fired,
but
i
think
that’s
really
somewhat
beside
the
point
because
this
issue
really
turns
on
an
admission
that,
as
to
the
element
of
the
executive
power
here
involved,
namely,
presidential
conversations,
they
weren’t
delegated.
so,
whatever
else
may
have
been
delegated,
those
were
not.
and,
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
resolve
a
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not
they
should
be
given
up
because
that
would
involve
this
court
in
the
prosecution
of
the
case
and
the
judicial
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
it
can,
sir,
with
respect
to
third
parties
but
it
should
not
involve
itself
with
the
executive
function
of
prosecuting
the
case.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
entirely
judicial.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and,
that,
we
move
to
quash
as
we
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
denial
of
our
motion
to
quash
is
one
of
the
issues
before
us.
that’s
right.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
guess
it’s
about
the
same
thing
as
whether
or
not
it
should
be
quashed
and
i
think
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
that
amounts
to
the
same
thing.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well
it
is
not,
in
the
context
of
the
proceedings
here
but,
in
the
context
of
whether
it’s
in
fact
involved
in
this
case,
it
is,
i
suggest,
political
in
the
sense
that
this
information
being
sought
admittedly
will
become
available
then
to
the
house.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well
the
question
is,
is
it
a
proper
issue
of
a
subpoena.
mr.
james
st.
clair
judges
make
mistakes,
as
do
lawyers,
and
maybe
even
presidents,
for
all
i
know,
but
the
point
i
want
to
make
with
you,
sir,
is
that
this
is
an
executive
function,
an
executive
decision,
one
not
delegated
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
we
submit
that
the
court
improperly
assisted
him,
that
the
court
has
no
right
to
determine
what
the
executive
will
offer
in
evidence.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and,
this
is
the
function
of
the
president.
no
one
has
contended
that
the
president
has
given
up
his
executive
responsibilities
under
the
constitution
and,
certainly,
the
prosecution
of
criminal
cases
is
an
executive
function.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
we
don’t
turn
them
loose
everyday
but
we
have
turned
a
number
loose
in
the
president’s
discretion
in
which
he
thought
was
an
appropriate
thing
to
do,
and
that’s
his
determination
that
governs,
we
suggest.
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
this
would
be
repetitious,
your
honor.
when,
already,
it
has
been
made
public.
mr.
james
st.
clair
those
20
--
those
would
be
the
tapes
of
20
conversations
already
made
public.
mr.
james
st.
clair
we’ll
provide
a
means
whereby
their
accuracy
can
be
verified.
mr.
james
st.
clair
to
release
a
whole
reel
of
tape
involving
a
number
of
conversations
poses
a
mechanical
problem.
mr.
james
st.
clair
in
so
far
as
it
relates
to
the
presidential
conversation
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
another
issue.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
correct,
sir.
i
don’t
know
how
separate
they
are
but
i’ll
certainly
make
use
of
both
of
them.
mr.
james
st.
clair
but
i’m
making
both
of
them
and
if
they’re
separate,
fine.
now,
with
respect
to
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
i
don’t
want
to
mislead
the
court
into
thinking
that
i
believe
mr.
jaworski
has
no
right
to
determine
any
evidence
that
he
communes.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
correct.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and
i
think
they’re
well-founded
in
the
law.
mr.
james
st.
clair
now
i’d
like
to
move,
if
i
may,
to
briefly
--
the
suggestion
that
the
issue
here
is
non-justiciable
on
the
grounds
other
than
i’ve
already
mentioned,
namely,
the
context
in
which
this
case
unfortunately
finds
itself.
it
seems
to
us,
briefly,
that
the
case
is
non-justiciable
for
somewhat
more
technical
reasons.
first,
this
is
an
issue
where
if
someone
has
to
exercise
some
discretion,
there
are
no
real
bounds
or
standards
by
which
that
discretion
should
be
exercised.
and,
by
traditional
standards
of
this
court
where
that
exists,
then
this
court
ought
not
to
take
the
case.
secondly,
it
seems
to
me,
there
is
a
textual
constitutional
grant
if
we
assume
that
the
grant
of
executive
power
includes
the
means
by
which
that
can
be
effectively
exercised,
second
ground.
third,
of
course,
there
is
the
political
involvement
which
i
have
suggested.
therefore,
i
suggest
quite
briefly
that
even
if
there
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
the
case
is
non-justiciable
for
these
additional
reasons.
the
standards
of
baker
and
carr,
and
powell
are
not
applicable
here.
there
are
no
individual’s
rights
over
being
protected
against
the
onslaught
of
government.
the
president
is
not
here
as
an
individual.
he
is
here
as
a
constitutional
officer
and
whom
the
executive
powers
rested.
there
is
no
philosophy
that
would
support
a
finding
of
justiciability
on
the
grounds
that
were
strengthening
the
democratic
process,
as
was
true
in
powell
and
also
into
a
greater
extent
in
baker
and
carr.
if
anything,
a
decision
in
this
case
against
the
president
would
tend
to
diminish
the
democratic
process.
this
president
was
elected
on
the
theory
that
he
would
have
all
the
powers,
duties,
and
responsibilities
of
any
other
president.
and
if
it’s
determined
that
he
doesn’t,
there
is
a
certain
amount
of
diminution
of
the
political
aspect
of
the
case
in
so
far
as
the
constituents
who
voted
for
him
are
concerned.
this
president
ought
not
to
have
any
less
powers
than
any
other
president
ought
to
have.
one
of
the
necessary
results,
as
i
view
it
and
my
brother’s
argument,
is
that
because
of
the
circumstances
of
this
case
richard
nixon
is,
let’s
say,
an
85%
president
not
100%
president.
and,
that
can’t
be
constitutional.
the
framers
of
the
constitution
had
in
mind
a
strong
presidency.
as
we
know,
they
considered
a
number
of
alternatives,
maybe
a
presidency
consisting
of
three
members.
all
of
those
suggestions
were
discarded
and
a
strong
presidency
was
decided
upon,
may
i
say,
to
the
distinct
advantage
of
this
country
as
history
has
developed.
now
by
reason
of
an
action
of
a
grand
jury,
the
special
prosecutor
suggest
that
this
president
has
something
less
than
any
other
president
would
have.
i
would
only
call
your
attention
to
the
action
of
the
framers
in
constitutional
convention
when
the
issue
was
raised
as
to
whether
or
not
a
president
who
was
under
impeachment
should
be
suspended
during
the
pendency
of
the
impeachment
proceedings.
and,
the
decision
was
definitely
he
should
not
because
the
framers
envisioned
a
strong
active
president
even
in
the
course
of
impeachment
proceedings.
they
did
not
want
this
country
to
be
led
by
someone
who
didn’t
have
those
full
powers
even
if
he
was
then
under
impeachment.
and,
indeed,
this
president
continues
to
function
as
president
as
he
should
even
though
there
are
impeachment
inquiries
underway.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
think
it
involves
both.
it’s
non-justiciable,
if
i
may,
because
it
does
involve
the
court
in
a
political
matter.
now,
mere
fact
that
politics
is
involve,
of
course,
has
not
prevented
the
court
from
taking
action
in
appropriate
cases
where
individual
rights
were
involved
or
where
the
franchise
of
voters
could
be
strengthened
by
the
decision
of
the
court.
i’m
suggesting,
in
this
case,
the
converse
is
true.
therefore,
the
justification
between
baker
and
carr
and
in
the
powell
case
is
not
available
or
is
not
applicable
here.
furthermore,
however,
the
argument
still,
in
my
view,
has
force
with
respect
to
the
consequences
of
the
grand
jury
action
in
naming
him
as
a
co-conspirator
which
we
suggest
they
were
not
qualified
to
do.
the
president
is
not
above
the
law
by
any
means.
but
the
law,
as
to
the
president,
has
to
be
applied
in
a
constitutional
way
which
is
different
than
anyone
else.
namely,
we
suggest
that
he
can
only
be
impeached
while
in
office
and
cannot
be
indicted
until
such
time
as
he
no
longer
is
in
office.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well
then
the
naming
of
the
president
by
a
grand
jury
as
a
co-conspirator,
if
that
has
the
effect
of
diminishing
the
president’s
rights,
it’s
a
pro
tanto,
if
i
may
say
so,
impeachment.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that
could
be
said
but
by
the
naming
him
of
an
unindicted
co-conspirator,
we
suggest,
is
an
intrusion
by
the
grand
jury
on
a
function
that
is
solely
legislative
and
not
judicial.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well
in
questions
of
immunity,
i
think,
individually
he
could
be
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
correct.
i
think
the
president
could
be
sued
for
backtaxes
in
his
individual
capacity.
but
in
terms
of
his
power
to
affect
the
responsibilities
of
his
office
to
protect
the
presidency
from
unwarranted
intrusions
into
the
confidentiality
of
his
communications,
that’s
not
a
personal
matter.
mr.
james
st.
clair
as
i
had
suggested,
that
if
that
defendant
will
satisfy
a
court
that
there
is
such
a
tape
and
will
identify
or
even
come
close
to
it
and
persuade
the
court
that
that
would
exonerate
him
or
there’s
reason
to
believe
it
might,
i
don’t
believe
will
have
a
question.
but,
that’s
not
what
my
brother
here
is
asking
for.
he’s
asking
for
a
set
number
of
tapes,
not
for
brady
purposes.
although
he
throws
that
in,
but
he
really
wants
them,
he
says,
for
prosecution
and
i’d
like
to
review
with
the
court
the
question
of
the
necessity
shown
for
this
because,
even
on
his
theory
of
a
qualified
privilege,
there
has
to
be
a
showing
of
some
necessity.
now
we
should
understand,
i’m
sure
the
court
knows,
that
all
of
these
individuals
here
involved
have
testified
before
the
senate
select
committee
with
the
exception,
i
believe
of
mr.
colson
who
now
has
plead
guilty
under
a
plea
bargain
where
he’s
agreed
to
cooperate
so
the
special
prosecutor
has
the
full
benefit
of
his
testimony.
they
have
testified
on
one
or
more
occasions
before
a
grand
jury.
in
addition,
the
president
has
furnished
to
the
special
prosecutor
the
transcripts
and
tapes
of
the
critical
conversations
involved
in
this
alleged
conspiracy.
i
might
reveal
those
very
briefly
with
you.
mr.
dean
in
his
senate
committee
testimony
suggested
that
on
september
15
the
president
acknowledged
knowledge
of
a
cover
up.
he
changed
that
later
to
a
testimony
that
he
believed
that
was
so
or
it
was
inference.
but
in
any
event,
the
president
furnished
that
portion
of
that
tape
of
the
conversation
with
mr.
dean.
mr.
dean
also
testified
that
on
march
13,
1973
he
discussed
the
cover
up
with
the
president
in
efforts
to
blackmail
the
president
by
one
of
the
defendants
who
broke
into
the
democratic
national
headquarters.
later
developed
that
that
was
mistaken
and
it
was
actually
on
march
21
and
the
grand
jury
indictment
proceeds
on
the
theory
of
march
21.
the
tape
of
the
conversation
of
march
13
was
furnished.
all
of
the
conversations
between
the
principals
being
two
in
number
on
march
21
were
furnished.
the
conversation
between
the
individuals
and
the
presidents
on
the
next
day
in
the
afternoon,
march
22,
was
furnished.
and,
a
large
number
of
additional
conversations
were
furnished.
now
if
reynolds
means
anything
and
reynolds,
in
addition
to
the
kaiser
aluminum
case,
noted
a
constitutional
question,
as
i
think
one
of
the
later
justices
suggested,
one
of
the
reasons
for
not
facing
that
issue
in
that
case
was
it
was
not
necessary
because
in
the
case
it
was
a
crash
of
a
bomber
that
was
on
a
secret
mission
and
the
court
said
that
the
parties
had
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses,
the
survivors,
and
other
testimony
so
it
wasn’t
necessary
to
get
to
the
constitutional
question.
i
suggest
that
that’s
true
here.
it’s
difficult
for
me
to
conceive
a
prosecutor
who
has
more
evidence
than
this
prosecutor
has.
he
has
the
full
benefit
of
a
senate
select
committee
investigation
which
staff
had
50
odd
lawyers,
existed
for
a
year.
he
has
the
benefit
of
his
own
investigation
of
a
grand
jury
that
sat
for
19
months
with
an
investigative
staff
of
similar
proportions.
he
simply
says
“i
need
this
because
i
want
to
present
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
case.”
he
does
not
say
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
a
tape
of
a
conversation
is
very
raw
material.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
right.
does
he
really
need
this?
what
does
he
say
he
needs
it
for?
he
says
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
he
doesn’t
say
that.
he
made
a
showing
to
the
court
below.
the
showing
is
available
to
you
here.
mr.
james
st.
clair
he
has
the
burden.
he
has
the
burden
under
reynolds,
under
kaiser
aluminum,
and
so
forth.
the
show
that
he
needs
and
what
does
he
says
he
needs
it
for.
he
doesn’t
say
he
needs
it
to
obtain
conviction.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes.
mr.
james
st.
clair
we
have
to
make
such
a
showing
and
i
say
that’s
our
only
burden.
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
it
would
have
to
be
a
confidential
communication.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
but
its
president
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
or
a
tennis
game
or
whatever.
mr.
james
st.
clair
my
brother
doesn’t
suggest
that’s
what
he
wants
either.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
a
little
closer
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
president
as
a
political
office
to
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
don’t
think
it’s
very
close,
no.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
don’t
think
my
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
my
brother
isn’t
seeking
any
such
conversations.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
as
i
read
some
of
the
cases
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
we
have
not
done
that.
we
have
simply
responded
to
an
assertion
that
these
all
relate
to
watergate,
assuming
that
to
be
the
fact.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
would
think
it
would
be.
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
because
he
has
the
duty;
(a)
to
enforce
the
laws,
that
is
to
prosecute
these
cases
and;
(b)
he
had
to
take
care
to
see
that
the
laws
are
enforced,
that
is
to
investigate.
and,
much
of
this
material
does
relate
to
the
investigation
as
1,200
and
some
pages
of
the
public
transcript
fully
discloses.
but
i
would
be
ready
to
concede,
and
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
difficult
problem
between
us,
that
the
president
should
show
that
the
circumstances
are
appropriate
for
the
claim
of
such
a
privilege
and
i
think
such
language
appears
in
mink
and
perhaps
in
reynolds
and
in
kaiser
aluminum.
simply,
it
has
to
be
a
confidential
communication
first
of
all.
mr.
james
st.
clair
first,
mink,
i
believe,
was
a
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
statutory
case,
but
that
was
one
of
the
exceptions.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
it
is,
if
it’s
confidential
and
it’s
between
the
president
and
some
advisor
with
respect
to
him
because,
otherwise
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
it
might
well
have
to
do
with
the
decision
making
process
if
the
facts
are
such
as
were
developed
in
the
course
of
an
investigation
with
regard
to
the
existence
of
a
obstruction
of
justice
charge,
much
of
which
the
president
was
involved
in.
but
the
fact
against
opinions
and
decisions
really
relate
to
another
situation,
as
i
suggest,
in
the
statute.
but,
the
conversation
that
the
president
has
with
his
advisers,
we
suggest,
is
absolutely
privilege.
it’s
a
discretionary
matter
that
he
has
to
exercise
in
what
he
is
going
to
release
and
not
release.
and
since
marbury
and
madison,
mississippi
and
johnson,
it’s
been
clear
that
the
court
will
not
direct
a
president
to
exercise
his
discretion
in
any
manner.
this
is
not
to
say
the
court
won’t
strike
down,
as
in
sawyer,
excessive
action
on
the
part
of
the
president
or
excessive
action
on
the
part
of
the
legislature.
that
has
happened
in
a
number
of
times.
but,
it’s
a
far
different
thing
to
suggest
that
the
court
should
undertake
to
direct
the
president
to
exercise
his
discretion
in
a
certain
manner.
it’s
not
a
ministerial
duty
by
any
means.
it’s
a
matter
of
discretion.
there
are
some
things
he
feels
he
properly
should,
under
the
circumstances,
make
available
and
others
he
shouldn’t.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i’d
like
to
discuss
very
briefly
gravel,
if
i
may,
for
example.
i
think
this
raises
a
very
important
question.
there
is,
of
course,
an
explicit
speech
and
debate
immunity
in
providing
the
constitution.
as
our
brief
indicates,
the
reason
for
this
is
quite
clear.
it’s
to
protect
the
legislature
from
unwarranted
invasion
from
the
executive
and
perhaps
the
judicial.
it
does
not
mean
that
the
executive
is
not
entitled
to
substantially
the
same
thing
by
implication.
and
at
least
in
the
civil
field,
as
we
have
pointed
out,
the
courts
have
worked
out
by
implication
as
a
necessary
ingredient
to
the
function
of
the
duties
of
the
executive
an
absolute
immunity
from
civil
liability
for
actions
taken
within
the
sphere
of
the
official.
swelling
and
violas,
i
guess,
is
the
leading
case
as
cited
and
barr
v.
mateo,
and
other
cases.
if
such
a
matter
can
be
worked
out
with
respect
to
the
executive
on
civil
matters,
we
suggest
there
is
no
reason
why
and,
in
fact,
the
court
should
spell
out
a
similar
exemption
in
criminal
matters
especially
as
they
relate
to
the
president,
himself,
because
while
i
said
the
president
is
not
above
the
law,
the
law
can
only
be
made
applicable
to
him
in
a
certain
way
while
he
is
in
office.
now
if
a
junior
congressman
can
commit
a
crime
on
the
floor
of
the
house
as
apparently
as
possible,
under
gravel
and
johnson,
is
it
to
be
said
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
has
less
immunity
than
a
junior
congressman?
i
think
not.
so
that,
i
suggest
to
you
that
common
sense
and
proper
construction
of
the
constitution
impinged
within
the
grant
of
executive
power
all
of
those
necessary
ingredients
to
make
it
work
to
be
effective
which
would
include
immunity
and
criminal
immunity.
the
president,
we
suggest,
cannot
be
indicted,
can’t
even
be
named
as
a
co-conspirator
because
that’s
an
assumption
of
a
legislative
function
under
the
constitution.
and,
therefore,
we
suggest
that
even
if
this
is
criminal
the
president
is
immune
from
the
ordinary
criminal
process.
he
is
not
immune
from
process,
but
that
process
that’s
available
to
the
president
is
a
process
of
impeachment
which
does
not
include
the
function
of
the
judiciary
branch.
and,
therefore,
we
say
that
if,
under
gravel,
the
congressman
is
entitled
to
immunity
even
from
criminal
conduct
where
actions
taken
within
the
legislative
sphere
of
his
conduct,
then
it
would
be
very
hard
to
support
a
proposition
that
the
president,
as
the
chief
executive
of
the
country,
is
entitled
to
less.
mr.
james
st.
clair
right,
and
the
reason
they
didn’t,
sir,
was
it
was
not
found
to
be
necessary.
they
didn’t
put
civil
immunity
in
the
constitution
either
for
the
executive
branch
and
this
court
has
found,
of
course,
that
there
is
such
an
immunity.
i’m
sorry,
sir?
mr.
james
st.
clair
it
was
a
speech
and
debate
clause
case
and
it
even
forbad
as
i
understand
the
gravel
case,
the
grand
jury
inquiry
into
motivations
and
actions
of
the
senator
and
his
aid.
mr.
james
st.
clair
right,
and
i
suggest
the
constitution,
by
clear
implication
provides
the
same
not
only
for
the
executive
but
for
the
judicial
as
well,
but
certainly
for
the
executive.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
i
would
suggest
you
should
find
it
in
the
constitution.
it
need
not
be
explicit.
it
can
well
be
implied.
mr.
james
st.
clair
if
you
cannot
find
it?
mr.
james
st.
clair
then,
if
your
honor
please,
that
portion
of
the
argument
is
lost
as
far
as
this
court’s
concerned,
i
guess.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
correct.
and,
we’re
suggesting
that
it
should
in
this
case
not
necessarily
because
a
great
deal
is
now
left
to
be
gained
by
expunging
the
grand
jury
action.
my
brother
is
right.
the
damages
has
been
done
and
we
think
quite
improperly
so.
we
think
the
tactics
involved
with
the
prosecutor
in
seeking
to
make,
enlarging
the
scope
of
admissible
testimony
is
hardly
worth
what
has
been
done
here
but
it’s
been
done.
but,
it
seems
to
me,
history
would
e
served
by
granting
of
the
relief
we
have
prayed
for
below,
namely,
to
expunge
this.
secondly,
it
seems
to
me
the
american
people
would
feel
better
about
the
fairness
of
the
issues
now
pending
before
the
house
is
this
act
which
we
say
was
improper
and
illegal
were
expunged.
but
in
so
far
as
the
mechanisms
of
this
case
are
concerned,
it
destroys
or
removes
a
basis
upon
which
they
contend
they
are
entitled
to
these
documents.
i’d
like
to
address
that
for
a
moment.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and
up
today,
you’ve
never
had
a
president
of
the
united
states
named
as
a
co-conspirator
either,
sir.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and
the
president
of
the
united
states
--[laughter]
and
i
don’t
mean
to
be
facetious
about
it
but
the
president
of
the
united
states,
we
suggest,
can
be
proceeded
against
only
by
impeachment
while
in
office
and
his
powers
are
unabated
until
such
time
as
he
leaves
that
office.
now,
with
respect
to
this
suggestion
that
a
grand
jury
finding
his
prima
facie
evidence
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
no.
this
case
is
unusual
in
many
respects.
this
suggestion
that
a
grand
jury
finding
is
prima
facie
evidence
and,
therefore,
the
president
has
lost
whatever
privilege
he
otherwise
would
have
had
it
just
isn’t
borne
out
by
either
the
facts
or
the
legal
issues
and
principals
involved.
the
grand
jury
finding
is
not
prima
facie
evidence.
even
if
it’s
mentioned
in
an
opening
argument
in
a
criminal
trial,
there’s
a
grave
risk
of
a
mistrial.
the
cases
cited
by
my
brother,
particularly
the
clark
case,
are
clearly
cases
which
require
a
showing
in
court
or,
in
clark,
a
showing
to
the
judge
that
there
was
prima
facie
evidence
of
wrong
doing.
you
may
recall
that’s
a
case
involving
investigation
into
a
juror
as
to
whether
or
not
the
juror
had
performed
properly,
and
the
juror
had
been
shown,
had
testified
falsely
in
the
qualifications
that
she
had
never
had
any
business
relations
with
one
of
the
parties
when,
in
fact,
she
had.
the
court
said
“well,
there’s
a
finding
of
wrong
doing
and,
based
on
that,
now
i
will
look
into
the
juror’s
deliberations
to
see
what
she
did.”
but,
justice
cardozo
made
it
very
clear
that
if
he
hadn’t
been
able
to
make
a
prima
facie
showing
a
wrong
doing
by
evidence
before
him
there
would
have
been
no
cause
for
“letting
in
the
light,”
as
he
put
it.
and,
the
un
case
and
other
cases
which
are
relied
on
by
my
brothers
are
all
cases
where
there
was
a
prima
facie
showing
in
a
courtroom.
a
grand
jury
charge
is
not
prima
facie.
in
the
first
place,
it’s
only
accusatory.
it’s
not
even
admissible
nor
can
it
be
referred
to
in
a
trial.
secondly,
it
can
well
involve
incompetent
evidence,
as
this
court
recently
decided,
and
it’s
totally
inappropriate
to
suggest
that
a
president
who
otherwise
would
have
a
very
valuable
privilege
and
i
think
i
should
emphasize
the
value
of
these
privileges
because
it
is
a
valuable
privilege.
all
you
have
to
do
is
read
justice
reed’s
decision
in
kaiser
aluminum
when
he
spells
it
out
quite
clearly
the
importance
and
value
of
this
privilege
to
simply
say
to
have
a
grand
jury
make
a
charge
that
destroys
that
privilege
is
an
argument
that
i
don’t
think
can
be
sustained.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
right.
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
don’t
believe
that
simply
because
the
constitution
does
not
explicitly
state
immunity,
as
it
does
in
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
should
this
court
hold
it
does
not
exist
in
criminal
matters.
i
would
like
to
make
one
point
with
the
court
however,
because
i’m
sure
the
point
will
be
raised
concerning
justice
carr
for
example.
there
is
a
distinct
difference,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
reply
brief
as
we
view
it,
between
a
president
of
the
united
states,
a
single
individual
in
who
the
entire
executive
function
is
vested.
a
president
serves
7
days
a
week
24
hours
a
day,
and
only
he
or
those
under
him
performing
his
functions
can
exercise
the
executive
function
of
our
government.
now,
if
a
congressman
or
a
senator
or
even
a
judge
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
or
a
vice
president
is
removed
from
his
duties,
matters
go
on.
but
a
president
doesn’t
have
that
opportunity
to
take
a
vacation
and
it’s
vested
in
one
individual
and
deliberately
so.
mr.
james
st.
clair
we
say
it’s
a
constitutional
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
correct.
i
think
so.
i
would
want
to
the
point
with
you
that
we
think
the
privilege
we’re
arguing
for
is
both
common
law
and
constitution.
mr.
james
st.
clair
it’s
constitutional
because
it’s
inherent
in
the
executive
power.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and
it’s
common
law
because
it
has
always
existed.
mr.
james
st.
clair
it
has
to
do
with
these
questions
of
immunity.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
my
brother
seems
to
think
it
does
because
they
say,
because
of
the
implications
of
criminality
here
the
president
has
lost
something
he
otherwise
would
not
have
had.
mr.
james
st.
clair
please
do.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
i
think
if
a
higher
privilege
has
been
accorded,
it
should
not.
but
in
any
event,
the
privilege
of
confidentiality
is
not
unimportant.
however,
let
me
direct
myself
to
your
question.
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no
one
knows.
mr.
james
st.
clair
you
won’t
know
until
you
listen
to
these
tapes
as
to
what
subjects
are
discussed.
my
brother
can
only
state
that
it’s
probable
they
relate,
at
least
in
part,
to
whatever
he
says,
watergate.
or
it’s
likely
that
it
might.
and,
i
have
had
the
experience
for
exempt
where
circumstances
were
such
that
the
house
committee
felt
that
it
was
likely
that
a
conversation
took
place
between
the
attorney
general,
mr.
mitchell,
and
the
president
regarding
plans
for
surveillance
of
democratic
parties.
when
you
look
at
the
conversation,
it
wasn’t
there
at
all.
mr.
james
st.
clair
so,
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
nor
does
the
prosecutor
know
what
additional
matters
may
be
interwoven
into
these
conversations.
one
thing
is
certain.
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
and
no
representation
could
be
made
to
the
contrary
either.
mr.
james
st.
clair
if
this
court
finds
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
that’s
right.
mr.
james
st.
clair
and
the
president
presumably,
if
he
were
to
comply
with
that
order,
would
make
such
a
representation
in
an
appropriate
case.
but
the
fundamental
point
is
we
believe
the
reason
stated
that
the
president’s
right
to
confidential
advice
is
important
and
it’s
actually
fundamental
to
the
proper
function
of
his
government
and
in
many
instances,
as
i
suggested,
even
more
important
in
military
matters
or
matters
of
state,
so
to
speak,
because
no
matter
what
the
conversation
is
of
course
it’s
the
fact
that
it
might
become
public
that
involves
them
this
chilling
effect
we’ve
made
reference
to
in
our
brief
under
the
first
amendment
but
as
a
practical
matter.
and,
i
can
see
it
myself.
the
communications
are
not
free
and
open
because
who
is
to
say
that
it
won’t
be
becalmed
before
a
grand
jury?
and,
most
everyone
in
the
white
house
has
been
becalmed
before
a
grand
jury,
sometimes
several
times.
the
fbi
has
interviewed
every
secretary
that
has
any
knowledge
of
any
aspect
of
this
case.
this
prosecutor
has
a
plethora
of
information.
he
says
he
wants
to
try
this
case
with
all
the
evidence,
so
he
knows
better
than
that.
nobody
tries
any
case
with
all
the
evidence.
you’d
be
buried
in
minutia.
you
select
the
evidence
that
you
think
most
appropriate
to
your
case.
you
don’t
try
it
with
all
the
evidence.
and
this
special
prosecutor
has
mountains
of
information.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
correct,
not
the
court.
and
if
that
evidence
constitutes
presidential
confidential
communication,
and
i
suggest
if
your
honor
please
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
president
determines
that.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
i
suggest
that’s
probably
the
fact
here.
so,
when
my
brother
says
“i
don’t
need
this
evidence
to
win
these
cases
in
my
opinion,
but
i
need
them
so
i
can
present
all
the
evidence,”
i’ve
been
trying
cases
long
enough
to
know
and
so
does
he
that’s
not
what
he’s
really
after.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
burden
under
17c
is
clearly
on
the
prosecution
and
the
burden
in
clearly
on
the
prosecution
on
every
other
aspect.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
i
suggest
whatever
was
considered
by
this
court
in
reynolds
to
be
enough
is
more
than
enough
in
this
case.
we
have
the
testimony
of
every
individual
involved.
a
number
of
them
have
pled
guilty.
dean
has
pled
guilty.
colson
has
pled
guilty.
comeback
has
pled
guilt,
etcetera,
etcetera.
all
under
plea
bargains
where
they
are
under
obligation
to
fully
cooperate.
this
prosecutor
is
not,
nor
does
he
say
at
any
point
that
he
needs
this
information
to
prosecute
successfully
these
cases.
mr.
james
st.
clair
then
the
president
wins,
in
my
view.
mr.
james
st.
clair
because
the
prosecutor
cannot
show
that
the
evidence
he
seeks
is
relevant
and
admissible.
mr.
james
st.
clair
because
of
the
nature
of
the
circumstance,
he
doesn’t
know
what’s
in
there.
mr.
james
st.
clair
but
you’d
have
to
know
what
the
matter
was
or
what
the
issues
in
the
case
were.
but
under
bowman
and
iozia,
it’s
not
enough
to
show
that
it
probably
is
or
it
might
be
or
is
likely
to
be.
it
must
be
shown
to
be
relevant
and
must
be
shown
to
be
admissible.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
why
it’s
not
a
third
party
scheme.
mr.
james
st.
clair
well
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
if
you
want
to
utilize
the
17c,
then
i
suggest
that’s
what
you
have
to
do.
mr.
james
st.
clair
as
a
prosecutor,
that’s
right.
as
a
grand
jury,
that’s
another
matter.
if
he
had
brought
--
sought
this
under
a
grand
jury
subpoena,
we
would
then
be
directly
faced
with
nixon
against
sirica
which
we
happen
to
think
was
improperly
and
incorrectly
decided.
but
under
17c,
we
are
dealing
with
the
prosecutor’s
subpoena.
the
evidence
of
decided
cases
makes
it
quite
clear
there
must
be
a
specific
showing
of
relevance
and
admissibility.
now,
if
he
can’t
do
it
because
of
the
nature
of
the
matter
then
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
his
problem,
not
mine.
mr.
james
st.
clair
most
of
those
cases
are
but
there
is
at
least
one
case,
i
think
it’s
grossman,
that
says
the
rules
are
equally
applicable
to
the
prosecution.
it’s
cited
in
one
of
the
footnotes
in
our
brief.
but,
the
17c
subpoena
is
conceptually
a
subpoena
for
known
information.
conceptually,
if
the
prosecutor
is
looking
for
things,
he
should
utilize
a
grand
jury
subpoena.
in
that
case,
i
think
in
bowman,
they
wanted
the
prosecutor
to
produce
each
document
he
was
going
to
use
in
the
presentation
of
his
case.
that’s
specific.
it’s
obviously
relevant
and
admissible.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that’s
correct,
and
certainly
not
under
these
circumstance.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
think
it
is
the
practice.
i
think
that
the
grand
jury
practice
is
far
greater
than
perhaps
the
constitution
has
envisioned.
it’s
really
used
today,
frankly,
as
an
effective
discovery
tool.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
quite
clearly,
under
the
analogy
that
was
provided,
i
may.
mr.
james
st.
clair
quite
clearly
so.
the
simple
reason,
sir
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
i’m
sorry.
mr.
james
st.
clair
the
answer,
sir,
is
that
criminal
conspiracy
is
criminal
only
after
it’s
proven
to
be
criminal,
and
we’re
not
at
that
point
yet.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that
is,
the
case
has
been
tried
and
defense
found
guilty.
mr.
james
st.
clair
but
the
fact
that
one
defendant
confessed
does
not
make
the
other
defendant
guilty.
mr.
james
st.
clair
first
of
all,
the
answer
is
yes
even
if
it
is
criminal
but,
more
importantly,
it
is
yes
because
criminality
is
something
that
is
not
necessarily
determined
at
the
time
that
you
must
resolve
the
issue.
and,
that
you
should
not
destroy
he
privilege
in
the
anticipation
of
a
later
finding
of
criminality
which
may
never
come
to
pass.
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
a
number
of
these
defendants
will
be
found
innocent
and
in
fact,
in
theory,
they
are
innocent
right
now.
mr.
james
st.
clair
to
avail
the
president,
if
your
honor
please,
of
the
free
and
untrammeled
source
of
information
and
advice
without
the
thought
or
fear
that
it
may
be
reviewed
at
some
later
time
when
some
grand
jury,
in
this
case,
or
some
other
reason
suggest
there
is
criminality.
for
example,
it’s
very
important—i’m
sorry.
mr.
james
st.
clair
yes,
in
the
president’s
discretion,
he
did
that.
and,
it’s
a
discretionary
matter.
but,
for
example,
the
simple
matter
of
appointment,
if
i
may,
an
appointment
of
a
judge.
it’s
very
important
to
the
judiciary
to
have
good
judges.
it’s
not
at
all
unheard
of
for
lawyers
to
be
asked
their
opinion
about
a
nominee.
now,
if
that
lawyer
wants
to
be
sure
that
he’s
going
to
be
protected
in
giving
candid
opinions
regarding
a
nominee
for
the
bench,
it’s
absolutely
essential
that
that
be
protected.
otherwise,
you’re
not
going
to
get
candid
advice.
now,
this
isn’t
a
state
secret.
it
isn’t
national
defense.
i
suggest
it’s
more
important
because
that
judge
may
sit
on
that
bench
for
30
years.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i’m
sorry,
sir.
i
didn’t
understand
your
question.
mr.
james
st.
clair
absolutely.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
would
think
that
that
could
not
be
released
if
it
were
a
confidential
communication.
if
the
president
did
appoint
such
an
individual,
the
remedy
is
clear.
the
remedy
is
he
should
be
impeached.
let
me
give
you
this
--
mr.
james
st.
clair
well,
if
you
know
about
it,
then
you
can
state
the
case.
if
you
don’t
know
about
it,
you
never
had
it.
mr.
james
st.
clair
no,
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
james
st.
clair
this
is
i
think
what
was
suggested
in
the
seaborg
case
where
the
court
said
“gee!
if
that’s
so,
then
floyd
could
be
all
covered
over
and
so
forth.”
human
experience
is
not
demonstrated
and
that’s
a
fact.
very
few
things
forever
are
hidden.
secondly,
however,
this
case
is
not
that
case.
as
i
pointed
out,
there
is
a
plethora
of
information.
this
is
not
a
case
where
there
is
no
information.
if
anything,
there
is
more
than
enough.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that
is
suggested
by
my
brothers.
mr.
james
st.
clair
my
brother
suggests
a
waiver,
but
this
privilege
is
not
like
fifth
amendment
privilege
or
attorney-client
privilege
where
if
you
let
out
one
word,
you’d
lost
the
whole
thing.
that
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
it.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
public
policy
requires
as
much
publicity
as
the
president
in
his
discretion
determines
would
be
appropriate
and
the
more
information,
the
better.
and
if
you
require
--
if
you
rule
that
one
utterance
constitutes
a
waiver,
you’re
not
going
to
get
it.
you’re
not
going
to
have
that
thing.
this
is
a
discretionary
privilege
that
the
constitution,
by
implication
of
necessity,
and
history
has
shown
is
inherent
in
the
executive
function
as,
indeed,
it
is
in
other
functions.
we’ve
cited
in
our
brief
similar
examples
of
the
legislature
insisting
upon
such
a
privilege
even
against
subpoenas
from
courts,
executives,
and
the
courts
themselves.
mr.
james
st.
clair
i
know
i
am.
i
do
appreciate
being
reminded
of
that
and
i
think
i
would
preserve
of
which
i
think
is
10
more
minutes.
mr.
james
st.
clair
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
in
response
to
my
brother’s
most
recent
argument,
of
course
sawyer
was
an
important
case
with
political
implications.
of
course,
the
other
cases
were
in
it
of
themselves
important
cases
with
political
implications.
but,
this
case
is
different
in
that
the
decision
in
this
case
will
have
an
undeniable
impact
on
another
proceeding
in
another
proceeding
which
the
constitution
says
is
essentially
a
political
proceeding
from
which
the
court
is
excluded.
and
for
this
court
to
be
drawn
into
that
thicket,
if
i
may
call
it
that,
seems
to
me
highly
inappropriate
at
least
at
this
time.
as
i
indicated
at
the
outset,
the
house
committee
has
made
certain
political
decisions.
the
president
has
made
certain
political
decisions.
they
will
each
have
to
bear
the
responsibility
of
those
decisions
with
the
american
people.
this
court
should
not
impair,
interfere
with,
or
otherwise
participate
directly
or
indirectly
in
that
proceeding.
and,
it’s
inevitable
it
would
happen.
this
courtroom
wouldn’t
be
full
today
if
this
were
simply
a
suit
on
a
subpoena
brought
by
the
special
prosecutor
against
the
president
even
though
that
would
be
an
important
political
matter
because
the
president
is
involved.
but,
this
is
important
for
other
reasons
quite
apart
from
that.
other
reasons
which
i
suggest
indicate
quite
clearly
that
this
court
ought
to,
in
its
discretion
and
in
its
judgment,
stay
its
hand
at
least
until
such
time
as
those
proceedings
have
run
their
course
because
those
are
political
decisions
being
made.
they
should
not
bear
the
burden
either
way
of
a
judicial
decision.
mr.
james
st.
clair
that
would
not
be
the
first
time,
mr.
justice
douglas,
that
a
criminal
trial
was
delayed.
and
in
balancing
the
importance
to
this
nation,
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
clearly
indicated
and
i
don’t
believe
the
defendants
would
be
crying
very
bitter
tears.
but
in
any
event,
the
justiciability
of
this
case,
seems
to
be,
the
single
important
obvious
matter
that
my
brother
would
prefer
not
much
to
talk
about,
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
it.
if
you
read
page
59
in
his
brief,
he
says
“he,
the
president,
is
now
the
subject
of
an
impeachment
inquiry
by
the
committee
on
the
judiciary
of
the
house
of
representatives
and
the
subpoenaed
evidence
may
have
a
material
bearing
on
whether
he
is
impeached
and,
if
impeached,
whether
he
is
convicted
and
removed
from
office.”
and,
i
suggest
the
constitution
in
all
of
the
history,
the
framers
makes
it
quite
clear
that
the
framers
conceived
impeachment
as
a
legislative
process.
the
court
was
excluded
specifically
from
that
function.
marbury
against
madison,
itself,
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice
that
it
decided
the
case
in
favor
of
the
president.
the
rule
was
discharged
and
the
commission
was
not
issued.
but
it
also
helps,
and
it’s
been
the
law
since
that
case,
that
the
courts
will
not
interfere
with
or
direct
a
discretionary
act
on
the
part
of
the
president
or
any
other
branch
of
government,
and
that’s
been
confirmed
in
mississippi
against
johnson
and
any
case
since
that
time.
and,
the
discretion
that
the
constitution
by
implication
and
by
necessity
that
has
been
vested
in
the
president
in
determining
which
of
his
confidential
communications
shall
be
made
public
or
released
is
a
discretionary
act
that
this
court
ought
not
by
its
decision
to
undertake
to
do
for
him
because
this
court
is
not
equipped
in
knowledge,
background,
or
in
any
other
way
to
exercise
that
discretion
for
the
president
of
the
united
states.
this
is
not
a
ministerial
act.
finally,
i
observe
a
slight
but
significant
shift
in
my
brother’s
position
with
respect
to
the
prima
facie
nature
of
naming
of
the
president
as
a
co-conspirator.
i
say
it
can
be
made
now
that
it
can
be
made
prima
facie,
i
take
it,
that
is
by
examining
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
evidence
in
fact
supports
that
determination.
we
have
invited
this
court
and
judge
sirica
to
do
just
that.
the
special
prosecutor
has
opposed
in
each
instance
this
or
any
other
court
looking
behind
that
to
see
whether,
in
fact,
the
evidence
can
be
made
as
he
now
states
a
position
to
support
a
charge
of
criminality.
before
the
argument,
the
argument
was
that
because
it
was
a
finding
or
a
vote,
it
was
prima
facie.
now
it
is,
i
take
it,
somewhat
different.
but
in
any
event,
an
action
by
a
grand
jury
purporting
to
assess
criminality
to
a
president
of
the
united
states
is
a
clear
intrusion
upon
the
legislative
function
and
power
with
respect
to
impeachment.
as
i
said
earlier,
the
president
is
not
above
the
law
nor
does
he
contend
that
he
is,
but
he
does
contend
that,
as
president,
the
law
can
be
applied
to
him
in
only
one
way
and
that’s
by
impeachment,
not
by
naming
as
a
co-conspirator
in
a
grand
jury
indictment,
not
by
indictment,
or
any
other
way.
therefore,
in
this
case,
i
urge
that
this
court
take
such
action
as
is
appropriate
and
overrule
judge
sirica’s
decision
and
order
that
this
case
be
dismissed.
