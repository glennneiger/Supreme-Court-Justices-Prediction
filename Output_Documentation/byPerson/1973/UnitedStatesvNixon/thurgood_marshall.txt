justice
thurgood
marshall
but
only
prima
facie.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
mandamus
is
not
your
action.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you’re
not
obliging
the
defendant,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
troubled
with
your
position
being
similar
to
us
attorney
because
the
us
attorney
is
absolutely
under
the
thumb
of
the
attorney
general.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
sorry.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
hasn’t
this
court
said
that
it
did
have
constitutional
overtone?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it’s
judicially
tailored?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
whether
or
not
he
had
the
authority,
they
did,
it
is
a
fact
that
the
grand
jury
did
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
it
doesn’t
--
i
don’t
see
how
we
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
they
had
authority
or
not.
it’s
a
fact.
isn’t
that
true?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
how
is
this
done?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
is
this
case
implemented?
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
are
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
district
court’s
decision
stands.
is
that
what
you
want?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
we
dismiss
as
improvidently
granted,
i
submit
the
district
court’s
premium
would
--
the
judgment
would
stand.
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
position
is
that
the
issuance
of
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
is
not
a
justiciable
issue.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
we
know?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
in
these
tapes
involves
the
impeachment
proceedings.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what,
in
any
of
these
tapes,
is
involved
in
the
impeachment
proceedings?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don’t
know
which
of
the
tapes.
i
assume
you
do.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
know
either.
well,
how
do
you
know
that
they’re
subject
to
the
greater
privilege?
justice
thurgood
marshall
regardless
of
what
it
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don’t
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
that’s
true,
why
are
you
willing
to
give
up
20
or
so?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i’m
talking
about
this
case.
you
say
you’ll
give
up
20
of
them
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
tapes
or
the
transcription?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
tapes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
the
tapes
that
you’re
willing
to
release
be
valuable
to
the
watergate
committee
in
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
you
said
you
didn’t
want
them
to
have
anything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
this
was
merely
an
evident
way
of
getting
stuff
over
to
him,
but
you
were
getting
some.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
if
the
house
can
get
them,
the
president
can
get
them,
and
the
only
people
i
know
who
can’t
get
them
is
the
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
the
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
in
the
tapes
that
they
ask
for
in
this
subpoena
duces
tecum,
which
is
the
only
thing
for
court,
has
any
effort
been
made
to
say
what,
if
any,
part
of
that
can
be
published?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
--
well,
you
don’t
think
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
think
that
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
is
sufficient
reason
for
you
to
pry?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
just
ignored
it,
didn’t
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
difference
between
ignoring
and
filing
a
motion
to
quash
is
what?
i
want
his
answer.
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you’re
submitting
the
matter
to
this
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
still
leave
it
up
to
this
court
to
decide
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in
what
sense?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
submitting
to
this
court
for
us
to
decide
whether
or
not
executive
privilege
is
available
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said,
in
this
case.
can
you
make
it
any
narrower
than
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
agree
that
that’s
what’s
before
this
court
and
you
are
submitting
it
to
this
court
for
decision?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
submitting
it
to
this
court
for
this
court’s
decision?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
this
court
decide
what’s
necessary
for
trial
of
a
criminal
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
only
question
was
if
this
is
a
subpoena
duces
tecum
that
was
issued
by
a
judge,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
slightly
judicial.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that’s
what
before
us.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that’s
what’s
before
us.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
thing
before
us
is
whether
or
not
the
subpoena
is
at
issue.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
that’s
not
political.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
mean
political
--
well,
i
don’t
see
whether
house
has
got
anything
to
do
with
the
court
that
i’m
talking
about.
you
said
it’s
a
political
and
not
judicial.
and,
i
submit
it
could
be
judicial
because
it
involves
the
issue
of
subpoena.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
the
executive
function
is,
as
i
understated,
the
discussion
as
to
whether
he
should
voluntarily
turn
over
to
the
special
prosecutor.
we
have
passed
that
stage.
we
are
now
at
the
stage
where
the
prosecutor
has
asked
the
court
to
assist
him
and
the
court
has
assisted
him.
does
that
not
take
it
a
step
beyond
pure
political
or
executive?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
get
that.
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that’s
actually
--
now,
you’re
arguing
absolute
privilege.
justice
thurgood
marshall
absolute
executive
even
though
everyday
it’s
so
you
loose
another
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
turn
things
loose
everyday,
i
suppose.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
he
getting
ready
to
turn
20
more
case
loose.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
you
said
in
your
brief
you
would
turn
20
loose?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
released
those
tapes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
still
saying
the
absolute
privilege
to
decide
what
shall
be
released
and
what
shall
not
be
released
is
vested
in
one
person
and
nobody
can
question
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
except
they
didn’t
put
him
in
the
constitution.
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
the
constitution
said
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
we
can’t
find
it
in
the
constitution,
what
happens
to
your
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
question
is
if
we
can’t
find
it,
what
happens
to
your
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
don’t
you
--
you
haven’t
lost
your
other
point
which
says
this
court
can
set
up
the
same
kind
of
privilege
that
they’ve
set
up
in
others.
justice
thurgood
marshall
who
is
to
determine
how
much
evidence
a
prosecutor
needs?
only
the
prosecutor
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
many
cases
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
many
cases
have
been
lost
because
the
prosecutor
had
too
much
evidence.
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
i’ve
tried
a
few
too,
but
mr.
st.
clair—[laughter]
i
was
just
wondering.
where
do
you
see
the
burden
here?
is
it
on
the
prosecution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright,
and
now,
how
much
is
enough
for
our
phrase
to
be
kicking
around
prima
facie
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
public
interest
in
keeping
that
secret?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
did
release
them
for
the
grand
jury
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
don’t
you
think
it
would
be
important
if
the
judge
and
the
president
were
discussing
how
they’re
going
to
make
appointments
for
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don’t
you
think
it
would
be
important
in
a
hypothetical
case
if
an
about
to
be
appointed
judge
was
making
a
deal
with
the
president
for
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
under
yours
it
couldn’t
be.
in
public
interest,
you
couldn’t
release
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
are
you
going
to
impeach
him
if
you
don’t
know
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you’re
on
a
prong.
it’s
a
dilemma.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
know
the
president
is
doing
something
wrong,
you
can
impeach
him
but
the
only
way
you
can
find
out
is
this
way.
you
can’t
impeach
him
so
you
don’t
impeach
him.
you
loose
me
someplace
along
there.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
only
prima
facie.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
mandamus
is

justice
thurgood

and
you’re

it
on
the
prosecution?
justice
thurgood
marshall
alright,
and
now,
how
much
is
enough
for
our
phrase
to
be
kicking
around
prima
facie
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
the
public
interest
in
keeping
that
secret?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
did
release
them
for
the
grand
jury
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
don’t
you
think
it
would
be
important
if
the
judge
and
the
president
were
discussing
how
they’re
going
to
make
appointments
for
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don’t
you
think
it
would
be
important
in
a
hypothetical
case
if
an
about
to
be
appointed
judge
was
making
a
deal
with
the
president
for
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
under
yours
it
couldn’t
be.
in
public
interest,
you
couldn’t
release
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
are
you
going
to
impeach
him
if
you
don’t
know
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you’re
on
a
prong.
it’s
a
dilemma.
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
know
the
president
is
doing
something
wrong,
you
can
impeach
him
but
the
only
way
you
can
find
out
is
this
way.
you
can’t
impeach
him
so
you
don’t
impeach
him.
you
loose
me
someplace
along
there.[laughter]
