justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don’t
see
the
relevancy
of
the
fact
that
the
grand
jury
indicted
the
president
as
co-conspirator.
the
legal
issue,
as
to
the
duty
to
deliver
pursuant
to
the
subpoena
that
you
are
asking
for
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
yes,
but
17c
presupposes
a
subpoena
running
against
the
party,
and
the
president
is
no
party.
he’s
not
a
defendant
in
one
of
these
cases.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
that
was
primarily
just
for
the
collage
information
of
the
house
judiciary
committee.
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
grand
jury
sent
it
to
the
house
committee,
didn’t
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
we
start
with
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
we
start
with
a
constitution
that
does
not
contain
the
words
“executive
privilege,”
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
so,
why
don’t
we
go
on
from
there?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
certainly
would
not
be
true
in
case
the
fifth
amendment
was
involved,
but
that’s
not
present
here.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
thought
the
heart
of
this
case
were
the
rights
of
defendants
in
criminal
trial?
justice
william
o.
douglas
nevertheless
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
may
be
exculpatory
and
free
them
of
all
liabilities.
i
don’t
know
but
i
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
none
of
our
problems,
are
they?
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
sole
authority
to
impeach
this
in
the
house
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
the
sole
authority
to
try
this
in
the
senate.
justice
william
o.
douglas
how
is
that?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
we’re
just
an
adjunct
of
the
house.
this
case
should
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that’s
deciding
it
on
the
merits.
justice
william
o.
douglas
did
you
argue
that
to
the
district
judge?
justice
william
o.
douglas
this
claim
was
honored
but
this
court
--
all
would
have
to
leave
the
evidence
and
go
to
judge
sirica
who
would
take
it,
examine
it
in
cameras.
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
as
i
have
said
before,
we
have
the
beneficiaries
here
are
six
defendants
who
are
being
tried
for
criminal
charges.
and,
what
the
president
has
made
freedom
completely
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
is
that
true
theoretically?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
the
president
or
any
president
could
be
sued
for
backtaxes,
penalties,
or
what
not?
justice
william
o.
douglas
but
it
speaks
of
persons,
any
persons?
justice
william
o.
douglas
it
may
be
if
one
of
these
defendants
might
be
exonerated
from
something
in
one
of
those
cases.
justice
william
o.
douglas
with
respect
with
that
particular
incidence,
the
one
here
involves
the
relevancy
of
materials
to
a
criminal
trial
and,
that,
normally
has
been
a
part
of
the
judicial
power
under
article
iii,
not
the
executive
power.
justice
william
o.
douglas
we’ve
been
asked
many
times
to
do
that
in
other
cases
with
respect
to
the
grand
juries.
up
today,
i
don’t
think
we’ve
ever
come
near
anywhere
to
it.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that’s
very
true.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that,
of
course,
have
never
been
decided
either.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
just
want
to
get
the
government’s
position
because
it
is
a
rather
important
part
of
the
case.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
under
that
theory,
all
the
criminal
trials
that
are
going
on
should
stop
today.
