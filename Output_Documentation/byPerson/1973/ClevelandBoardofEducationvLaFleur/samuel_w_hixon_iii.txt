mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
sam
hixon
and
i
am
here
to
represent
the
chesterfield
county
school
board.
perhaps
i’m
taking
the
reverse
approach
to
this
case,
but
i
wish
to
skip
over
temporarily
the
question
of
what
type
of
test
should
be
applied
in
this
case
and
move
directly
to
the
question
of
what
is
the
basis,
the
reasonable
and
rational
basis
for
the
chesterfield
maternity
leave
provision.
the
school
board
recognizes
in
these
cases
that
there
is
an
educational
advantage
to
having
a
teacher
full
time
throughout
the
year
who
can
work
with
the
individual
student
on
an
individual
basis.
and
it’s
for
that
reason,
that
the
school
board
requires
that
each
individual
teacher
sign
a
written
contract
at
the
beginning
of
her
employment.
guarantying
that
she
will
be
employed
by
one
year
period
of
time,
this
contract
is
a
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
by
having
one
teacher
without
any
interruption
during
the
whole
course
of
one
year,
the
objective
of
continuity
in
education
is
accomplished.
with
this
in
mind
and
for
many
reasons,
the
school
board,
recognizes
that
it
is
making
the
transition
from
one
teacher
to
the
next
to
smooth
and
is
nondisruptive
as
possible
by
the
application
of
the
chesterfield
maternity
provision.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
yes
your
honor.
to
answer
that
question,
let
me
say
first
to
your
initial
question,
i
believe
that
the
school
board
could
have
a
regulation
which
prohibited
pregnant
women
from
beginning
the
contract
term
because
they
know
at
that
very
point
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
--
that
there
will
be
an
interruption
during
the
year.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
but
this
regulation
has
an
advantage
your
honor
and
that
it
requires
only
one
affirmative
act
on
the
part
of
the
teacher.
she
is
required
six
months
before
the
expected
date
of
delivery
of
her
child,
now
which
is
three
months
after
she
becomes
pregnant.
she
is
required
to
come
in
at
that
point
and
give
the
school
board
notice
and
with
that
one
affirmative
act
on
her
part,
the
school
board
automatically
at
that
point
triggers
an
administrative
procedure
for
preparing
for
her
replacement.
they
can
go
out
at
this
point,
they
can
interview,
they
can
talk
to
teachers
and
they
can
offer
them
a
position
at
a
fix
point
in
time
that
is
the
termination
of
the
first
month
of
an
employment.
and
this
is
very
important
to
the
school
board,
because
i
don’t
agree
with
what
my
colleague
has
said
that
the
only
purpose
is
to
provide
a
replacement.
the
purposes
to
provide
a
replacement
who
is
well
qualified,
who
is
well
trained
and
can
do
the
job
adequately,
and
with
this
two
months
leave
time
which
is
effectively
what
we
have,
the
school
board
can
go
out
and
hire
and
look
for
the
most
qualified
teacher
to
come
in
at
the
end
of
that
fifth
month
period
of
time.
now,
of
course
the
chesterfield
provision
is
much
more
flexible
than
others.
it
provides
that
the
school
board
can
extend,
pass
the
first
month
of
employment,
the
teacher,
if
the
teacher
so
request
and
the
teacher
has
permission
of
her
doctor
and
if
the
school
board
determines
that
it’s
in
the
best
interest
of
the
students,
because
this
is
essentially
what
we
are
dealing
with
here.
now,
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
school
board,
if
the
final
date
of
the
five
months
period
would
fall
along,
let’s
say
may
1st
and
the
end
of
the
school
year
was
may
the
15th,
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
school
board
would
continue
her
until
may
the
15th,
because
it
would
accomplish
the
objective
of
continuity
but
here
we
don’t
have
that
situation.
we
had
here
a
situation
in
which
mrs.
cohen
wish
to
teach
until
her
9th
month
of
pregnancy
which
was,
she
initially
requested
that
she
teach
up
until
april
1st.
she
later
changed
her
mind
and
decided
to
terminate
her
employment
on
january
19th.
but
here
we
have
a
question
where
the
school
board
made
a
decision
on
its
own
whether
or
not
it
would
be
better
from
the
standpoint
of
the
students
to
continue
the
employment
of
mrs.
cohen
until
the
date
that
she
so
specified
or
whether
it
would
be
better
for
the
student
body
and
for
the
students
to
terminate
her
employment
at
the
christmas
recess,
which
i
submit
seem
to
them
to
be
a
reasonable
date
for
termination
of
employment.
the
record
in
this
case
clearly
justifies
and
supports
the
rationality
of
that
argument.
upon
mrs.
cohen’s
termination,
there
was
a
replacement
that
it
was
available,
who
the
school
board
was
able
to
go
out
and
hire
to
offer
her
a
job
on
a
fix
date,
that
is,
the
day
beginning
after
the
christmas
vacation.
to
offer
her
that
position
and
have
her
come
in
and
remain
with
the
students
for
the
rest
of
the
year.
this
is
a
continuity
which
was
accomplished
by
the
administrative
procedure
which
is
set
up
her.
the
replacement
was
a
duly
qualified
teacher
with
a
master’s
degree.
now,
this
is
not
an
argument
which
i
have
contrived
for
purposes
of
arguing
into
this
court
up
to
fourth
circuit.
it’s
an
argument
that
is
clear
in
the
record
in
this
case.
dr.
kelly
who
is
a
divisional
superintendent
testified
in
the
appendix
at
page
109
and
also
at
the
page
113
why
this
regulation
existed
and
why
this
rule
existed,
and
it’s
entirely
in
line
with
the
continuity
argument
that
i
have
presented
to
this
court.
but
even
if
it
weren’t
in
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
rule
or
regulation
is
to
fall
or
stand
under
the
attacks
on
the
equal
protection
clause
doesn’t
depend
on
the
rationality
which
is
directed
towards
that
rule
or
regulation
by
a
particular
member
of
the
school
board.
it
can,
as
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions,
come
from
the
argument
which
are
made
by
a
counsel
or
can
come
from
the
court
itself.
and
this
court
and
this
court
has
said
that
if
there
is
any
reason
which
we
can
concede
to
support
this
regulation
then
it
should
be
upheld
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
yes
she
does,
she
will
be
guaranteed
reemployment
not
later
than
beginning
of
the
next
year
from
the
period
of
time
that
she
is
placed
on
maternity
leave.
now
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
not
later
than
that
date.
if
there
is
a
position
available
that
they
can
move
or
into
the
regulation
provided
that
she
can
be
offered
reemployment
at
anytime.
so,
and
--
the
regulation
also
provides
that
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
yes
sir,
not
later
than
that
date.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
it’s
the
beginning
of
the
next
school
year
your
honor.
the
teacher
does
not
lose
her
right
to
seniority
and
she
does
not
lose
her
right
to
personal
benefits.
she
does
not
lose
her
tenure.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
no
sir,
she
doesn’t,
she
would
only
accrue
seniority
for
the
period
of
time
when
she’s
actually
completed.
the
only
thing
that
the
school
teacher
loses
here
is
a
period
of
employment
where
she
loses
wages.
this
is
the
only
complaint
that
the
school
teacher
can
have
in
this
case.
now,
this
case
does
not
--
or
in
this
the
school
teacher
wishes
really
to
accomplish
the
best
of
two
worlds.
there’s
not
an
attack
here
by
the
school
teachers
on
maternity
provision
itself.
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
the
maternity
provision
was
adapted
in
part
by
school
teachers
who
participated,
women
school
teachers
who
participated
in
the
rules
adaption.
so,
we
are
not
really
here
talking
about
the
merits
or
demerits
of
maternity
leave
because
it’s
conceded
that
that
petitioner
in
this
case
wants
the
merits
of
maternity
leave.
her
only
objection
is
to,
one,
clearly
defined
the
area
and
that
is
i
wish
to
choose
the
manner
in
which
the
maternity
provision
is
implemented
as
opposed
to
having
the
school
board
make
this
choice.
and
that’s
really
the
only
issue
that’s
involved
in
this
case
and
whether
or
not
that
precise
issue
is
guaranteed
by
the
constitution.
in
addition
to
this
continuity
argument
that
i
have
presented
here,
we
don’t
wish
to
not
rely
upon
the
medical
reasons
which
justify
the
regulation.
the
record
in
this
case
and
also
the
clause
complete
in
the
fact
that
they
are
all
certain
conditions
that
occur
only
in
a
pregnant
woman
and
they
are
all
--
there
are
certain
conditions
that
are
disorders
a
pregnancy
that
can
occur
only
in
the
last
trimester
which
is
perhaps
one
reason
why
the
fifth
month
date
was
picked
out.
for
example,
toxemia,
anemia
and
hemorrhagic
conditions
related
to
the
placenta.
these
are
conditions
that
occur
only
in
a
pregnant
woman
in
these
latter
stages
of
her
pregnancy.
in
addition,
there
are
obvious
conditions
that
relate
only
to
a
pregnant
woman.
for
example,
she
has
lack
of
balance
caused
by
the
size
of
the
fetus
in
the
latter
months
of
pregnancy.
she
is
more
subject
to
falling,
her
center
of
gravity
changes
and
this
record
shows
that
there
is
the
possibility
that
a
pregnant
woman
be
subject
to
pushing
and
shelving
in
the
school
and
this
record
also
shows
that
a
pregnant
woman
will
have
to
visit
her
obstetrician
13
times
during
her
pregnancy
with
the
more
frequent
visits
being
in
the
last
several
months
of
her
pregnancy.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
yes
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
no,
the
record
does
not
show
that
your
honor.
the
record
only
touches
on
that
indirectly.
it
will
reflect
that
at
the
time
mrs.
cohen
applied
to
the
school
board
in
the
month
of
december
that
there
were
three
other
women
who
are
applying
for
an
extension
of
the
maternity
provision
in
the
same
month.
that’s
the
only
in
which
the
record
in
this
case
reflects
on
the
question
that
you’ve
asked.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
no
sir,
the
record
does
not
show.
there
was
no
statistical
data
produced
in
the
records
of
this
case
to
show
or
to
support
the
contention
that
there
were
an
increase
in
absences
of
teachers
during
the
last
trimester
of
their
pregnancy.
that
evidence
just
does
not
exist
except
for
the
fact
that
we
do
know
that
pregnancy
in
and
of
it
self
will
cause
the
teacher
to
increase
her
visits
to
her
obstetrician,
which
could
very
well
lead
to
her
absence
from
her
teaching
choice
particularly
in
the
last
trimester
that’s
involved
here.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
i
am
sorry
sir
i
didn’t
understand.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well
sir,
of
course
the
record
in
this
case
won’t
reflect
that.
look
at
allergies
as
entirely
different
situation,
because
pregnancy
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
yes
sir,
but
the
difference
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well
sir,
the
record
shows
clearly
in
this
case
that
doctor
who
testified
here
that
his
normal
hours
that
he
would
accept
patients
would
be
between
hours
of
9
and
4
o’clock
in
the
afternoon.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
i’d
have
no
idea
to
answer
to
that
your
honor.
i
do
know
that
the
doctor
who
was
deposed
in
this
case
said
he
didn’t
work
at
night
and
he
also
didn’t
work
on
the
weekends.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well
sir,
i
put
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
i
put
that
emphasis
only
because
it
points
out
clearly
that
there
is
a
likelihood
during
the
last
three
months
that
a
woman
will
be
absent
because
of
her
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well,
i’m
talking
--
it’s
in
the
last
four
months
you
are
correct,
but
i
use
generally
because
the
doctor
seems
to
break
it
up
into
trimester,
the
first,
second
and
third
and
their
testimony
relates
only
to
the
last
trimester.
but
i
think
that
there
is
nothing
magic
about
the
fifth
month,
it
could
be
the
fourth
month
or
the
fifth
month
or
the
sixth
month.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
it
could
be,
but
here
we’re
dealing
with
a
question
of
whether
or
not
one
is
grateful
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
that
could
be.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
yes
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
but
let
me
point
out
here,
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
problem
that
exist
in
the
chesterfield
county
school
board.
if
we
find
out
that
there
is
another
problem
in
terms
of
conditions
that
are
peculiar
only
to
man
or
peculiar
only
to
all
--
are
peculiar
to
all
people,
i
think
the
school
board
could
easily
regulate
that
condition.
but
here,
they
are
dealing
with
the
condition
that
know
exist
and
they
know
creates
a
problem
for
them
and
does
the
constitution
require
that
they
regulate
every
potential
condition
causing
a
disruption
in
the
school
board
or
is
the
constitution
or
does
it
only
require
that
there
would
be
a
rational
basis
or
reasonable
basis
for
the
regulation
that
we’ve
got
here.
that’s
the
issue.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
yes
sir,
and
that’s
what
i
have
tried
to
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well,
i
don’t
see
the
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
i’m
sorry
but
i
don’t
understand
the
question.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well,
i
think
the
school
board
can
very
clearly
regulate
and
direct
its
regulations
to
a
condition
of
potential
import
in
the
condition
of
potential
disruption.
the
school
board
need
not
wait
until
an
injury
occurs
to
a
pregnant
mother
in
a
school
system
during
the
last
several
months
of
pregnancy
in
order
for
them
to
justify
this
rule
as
being
rational.
they
can
regulate
as
to
potential
disruptions
that
may
occur.
i
don’t
say
that
condition
--
a
disruption
will
occur
in
every
pregnant
school
teacher.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
i
would
say
under
those
circumstances,
if
you
could
relate
the
condition
of
a
man’s
instability
with
his
ability
to
teach
which
is
a
question
in
and
of
itself,
if
you
could
relate
that
matter
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
i
believe
that
a
regulation
directed
towards
that
condition
and
to
the
facts
that
you
have
given
me
would
be
a
rational
and
reasonable
regulation.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well,
of
course
here
again
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
yes,
well
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well,
i
would
say
that
if
you
could
show
that
the
instability
that
you
are
here
--
that
you
are
talking
about
here
would
have
a
direct
effect
on
the
ability
of
teachers,
particularly
men
teachers
in
the
school
system,
you
could
have
a
regulation
directed
towards
that
but
we
don’t
have
that
here
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
we
have
got
a
condition
here
where
a
100%
of
the
people
affected
by
the
rule
are
in
fact
pregnant
and
we
do
know
one
thing,
that
they
are
going
to
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
a
100%
are
not
unable
to
teach.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
no
sir,
because
i
think
that
the
rule
here
can
be
clearly
justified
on
the
basis
that
it
accomplishes
continuity
in
the
educational
process
by
having
an
orderly
procedure
for
replacement
of
teachers
who
become
pregnant.
now,
there
is
only
one
person,
now
there
are
only
one
class
of
people
that
are
affected
by
this
rule,
and
that
is
pregnant
women
who
are
at
least
five
months
pregnant
and
who
wish
to
choose
from
the
themselves
what
date
they
will
terminate
their
employment
rather
than
having
the
school
board
terminate
their
employment,
and
that
is
the
only
class
of
person
that
is
affected
by
this
rule.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well
sir,
i
think
that
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well,
there
is
one
advantage
to
picking
five
months
and
that
the
elasticity
provision,
the
additional
four
months.
it
gives
you
some
time
to
carry
over
to
teacher.
if
you
believe
that
it’s
in
the
best
interest
of
the
school
board
that
she’d
be
allowed
to
continue
teaching
to
appear
at
the
time,
the
example
that
i
gave
may
1st,
if
you
wanted
to
continue
her
employment
for
another
month
you
could
do
so,
but
i
suppose
that
the
one
reason
that
five
months
period
of
time
was
selected
was
because
most
women
would
prefer
to
stop
teaching
after
that
fifth
month.
and
i
point
out
again
that
this
maternity
provision
provides
a
benefit
to
women
in
the
sense
that
they
can
breach
their
contract
which
i
have
entered
into
and
they
can
breach
that
contract
without
any
re-precaution.
so,
we’re
dealing
here
with
the
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
yes
sir,
that’s
correct.
but
if
it’s
going
to
be
a
balance
drawn
between
the
interest
of
the
students
and
the
interest
of
the
children
in
having
quality
education
by
preventing
disruption
and
there
is
going
to
be
a
disadvantage
mainly
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well,
that’s
exactly
what
the
school
board
is
trying
to
avoid,
a
substitute
teacher.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
they
are
trying
to
have
a
replacement
there
who
is
qualified
and
who
can
remain
with
the
school
children
for
the
rest
of
the
year,
because
having
one
teacher
throughout
the
year
is
admittedly
a
valid
educational
objective.
i
mean
the
district
judge
in
this
case
admitted,
he
said
i
will
find
or
i
will
recognize
in
this
case
that
it’s
good
for
education
to
have
one
teacher
there
throughout
the
year.
that’s
why
we
got
the
one
year
contract.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
it
doesn’t
guarantee
that,
but
it
goes
along
way
towards
making
that
transition.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well,
what
really
is
the
objective
here
is
to
prevent
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
what
is
really
the
objective
is
to
deal
away
with
the
disruption
which
is
caused
by
teacher
leaving
without
having
given
notice
and
the
disruption
caused
by
not
having
a
replacement
available
who
can
take
over
them
at
the
school,
at
the
classroom.
that’s
the
objective
of
the
regulation.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
nothing
except
the
facts
in
this
particular
case
your
honor.
in
the
appendix
again
at
page
114,
it
shows
that
dr.
kelly
testified,
if
he
was
able
with
his
lead
time
and
mind
to
go
out
and
solicit
and
to
hire
a
replacement
teacher
who
he
hoped
could
be
at
least
as
qualified
as
mrs.
cohen
and
who
could
take
in
and
--
come
in
and
replace
her.
and
other
than
that
example,
as
it’s
applied
to
mrs.
cohen,
there
are
no
statistics,
but
i
believe
that
the
facts,
say,
i
found
in
mrs.
cohen’s
particular
case
are
the
best
justification
for
this
regulation,
because
the
school
board
was
able
to
go
out
with
its
lead
time
and
with
its
planning
device
and
with
its
planning
tool
and
hire
a
qualified
replacement
who
is
available
to
come
in
right
after
the
christmas
recess.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
no
sir,
i
believe
the
penalties
for
the
breach
of
employment
contract
in
the
sense
that
she
agrees
at
the
outset
of
her
employment
that
she
is
going
to
teach
for
one
year.
and
as
i
have
said
before,
that’s
the
objective
to
have
a
teacher
there
for
the
entire
year,
and
i
would
think
that
under
those
circumstances
the
school
board
would
be
justified
in
not
offering
her
reemployment
because
she
has
breached
or
contract
voluntarily.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well,
i
see
what
you’re
driving
at
your
honor
but
i
wouldn’t
take
that
position,
because
i
believe
that
pregnancy
is
sui
generis,
it’s
a
condition
that’s
peculiar
only
to
women
and
it’s
a
condition
which
i
believe
the
school
board
is
justified
in
treating
differently
than
any
other
condition.
and
for
that
reason,
i
don’t
think
that
a
person
that
you’ve
describe
would
have
that
claim.
now,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
asserted
that
this
is
a
sex
classification
case.
and
of
course
in
our
brief,
we
have
taken
the
position
and
strongly
represent
to
this
court
that
this
is
not
in
fact
a
classification
that’s
based
on
sex,
what
perhaps
is
triggering
the
strict
scrutiny
test.
we
don’t
have
here
a
classification
which
treats
men
and
women
different
solely
because
of
their
sex
who
are
similarly
situated.
we
have
a
condition
here
that,
or
our
regulations
that
is
directed
towards
a
particular
and
easily
definable
area
that
is
pregnant
women.
it’s
not
a
classification
based
on
sex
to
treat
men
differently
and
say
their
employment
in
the
united
state
army
where
they’re
maybe
required
to
shave
off
their
beard,
this
is
not
traditionally
known
as
a
classification
that’s
based
on
sex,
but
triggering
some
suspect
area
in
which
the
court
will
look
with
strict
scrutiny
on
the
classification
that’s
involved.
we
have
here
a
peculiar
condition
that
should
be
and
we
represent
to
this
court
should
be
handled
under
to
the
traditional
rational
basis
test.
and
for
the
reasons
that
we
have
set
forth
particularly
the
continuity
and
the
medical
conditions
that
exist
and
wanting,
we
would
pray
that
the
opinion
of
the
fourth
circuit
be
sustained
and
be
upheld.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
sam
hixon
and
i
am
here
to
represent
the
chesterfield
county
school
board.
perhaps
i’m
taking
the
reverse
approach
to
this
case,
but
i
wish
to
skip
over
temporarily
the
question
of
what
type
of
test
should
be
applied
in
this
case
and
move
directly
to
the
question
of
what
is
the
basis,
the
reasonable
and
rational
basis
for
the
chesterfield
maternity
leave
provision.
the
school
board
recognizes
in
these
cases
that
there
is
an
educational
advantage
to
having
a
teacher
full
time
throughout
the
year
who
can
work
with
the
individual
student
on
an
individual
basis.
and
it’s
for
that
reason,
that
the
school
board
requires
that
each
individual
teacher
sign
a
written
contract
at
the
beginning
of
her
employment.
guarantying
that
she
will
be
employed
by
one
year
period
of
time,
this
contract
is
a
part
of
the
record
in
this
case.
by
having
one
teacher
without
any
interruption
during
the
whole
course
of
one
year,
the
objective
of
continuity
in
education
is
accomplished.
with
this
in
mind
and
for
many
reasons,
the
school
board,
recognizes
that
it
is
making
the
transition
from
one
teacher
to
the
next
to
smooth
and
is
nondisruptive
as
possible
by
the
application
of
the
chesterfield
maternity
provision.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
yes
your
honor.
to
answer
that
question,
let
me
say
first
to
your
initial
question,
i
believe
that
the
school
board
could
have
a
regulation
which
prohibited
pregnant
women
from
beginning
the
contract
term
because
they
know
at
that
very
point
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
--
that
there
will
be
an
interruption
during
the
year.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
but
this
regulation
has
an
advantage
your
honor
and
that
it
requires
only
one
affirmative
act
on
the
part
of
the
teacher.
she
is
required
six
months
before
the
expected
date
of
delivery
of
her
child,
now
which
is
three
months
after
she
becomes
pregnant.
she
is
required
to
come
in
at
that
point
and
give
the
school
board
notice
and
with
that
one
affirmative
act
on
her
part,
the
school
board
automatically
at
that
point
triggers
an
administrative
procedure
for
preparing
for
her
replacement.
they
can
go
out
at
this
point,
they
can
interview,
they
can
talk
to
teachers
and
they
can
offer
them
a
position
at
a
fix
point
in
time
that
is
the
termination
of
the
first
month
of
an
employment.
and
this
is
very
important
to
the
school
board,
because
i
don’t
agree
with
what
my
colleague
has
said
that
the
only
purpose
is
to
provide
a
replacement.
the
purposes
to
provide
a
replacement
who
is
well
qualified,
who
is
well
trained
and
can
do
the
job
adequately,
and
with
this
two
months
leave
time
which
is
effectively
what
we
have,
the
school
board
can
go
out
and
hire
and
look
for
the
most
qualified
teacher
to
come
in
at
the
end
of
that
fifth
month
period
of
time.
now,
of
course
the
chesterfield
provision
is
much
more
flexible
than
others.
it
provides
that
the
school
board
can
extend,
pass
the
first
month
of
employment,
the
teacher,
if
the
teacher
so
request
and
the
teacher
has
permission
of
her
doctor
and
if
the
school
board
determines
that
it’s
in
the
best
interest
of
the
students,
because
this
is
essentially
what
we
are
dealing
with
here.
now,
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
school
board,
if
the
final
date
of
the
five
months
period
would
fall
along,
let’s
say
may
1st
and
the
end
of
the
school
year
was
may
the
15th,
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
school
board
would
continue
her
until
may
the
15th,
because
it
would
accomplish
the
objective
of
continuity
but
here
we
don’t
have
that
situation.
we
had
here
a
situation
in
which
mrs.
cohen
wish
to
teach
until
her
9th
month
of
pregnancy
which
was,
she
initially
requested
that
she
teach
up
until
april
1st.
she
later
changed
her
mind
and
decided
to
terminate
her
employment
on
january
19th.
but
here
we
have
a
question
where
the
school
board
made
a
decision
on
its
own
whether
or
not
it
would
be
better
from
the
standpoint
of
the
students
to
continue
the
employment
of
mrs.
cohen
until
the
date
that
she
so
specified
or
whether
it
would
be
better
for
the
student
body
and
for
the
students
to
terminate
her
employment
at
the
christmas
recess,
which
i
submit
seem
to
them
to
be
a
reasonable
date
for
termination
of
employment.
the
record
in
this
case
clearly
justifies
and
supports
the
rationality
of
that
argument.
upon
mrs.
cohen’s
termination,
there
was
a
replacement
that
it
was
available,
who
the
school
board
was
able
to
go
out
and
hire
to
offer
her
a
job
on
a
fix
date,
that
is,
the
day
beginning
after
the
christmas
vacation.
to
offer
her
that
position
and
have
her
come
in
and
remain
with
the
students
for
the
rest
of
the
year.
this
is
a
continuity
which
was
accomplished
by
the
administrative
procedure
which
is
set
up
her.
the
replacement
was
a
duly
qualified
teacher
with
a
master’s
degree.
now,
this
is
not
an
argument
which
i
have
contrived
for
purposes
of
arguing
into
this
court
up
to
fourth
circuit.
it’s
an
argument
that
is
clear
in
the
record
in
this
case.
dr.
kelly
who
is
a
divisional
superintendent
testified
in
the
appendix
at
page
109
and
also
at
the
page
113
why
this
regulation
existed
and
why
this
rule
existed,
and
it’s
entirely
in
line
with
the
continuity
argument
that
i
have
presented
to
this
court.
but
even
if
it
weren’t
in
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
rule
or
regulation
is
to
fall
or
stand
under
the
attacks
on
the
equal
protection
clause
doesn’t
depend
on
the
rationality
which
is
directed
towards
that
rule
or
regulation
by
a
particular
member
of
the
school
board.
it
can,
as
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions,
come
from
the
argument
which
are
made
by
a
counsel
or
can
come
from
the
court
itself.
and
this
court
and
this
court
has
said
that
if
there
is
any
reason
which
we
can
concede
to
support
this
regulation
then
it
should
be
upheld
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
yes
she
does,
she
will
be
guaranteed
reemployment
not
later
than
beginning
of
the
next
year
from
the
period
of
time
that
she
is
placed
on
maternity
leave.
now
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
not
later
than
that
date.
if
there
is
a
position
available
that
they
can
move
or
into
the
regulation
provided
that
she
can
be
offered
reemployment
at
anytime.
so,
and
--
the
regulation
also
provides
that
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
yes
sir,
not
later
than
that
date.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
it’s
the
beginning
of
the
next
school
year
your
honor.
the
teacher
does
not
lose
her
right
to
seniority
and
she
does
not
lose
her
right
to
personal
benefits.
she
does
not
lose
her
tenure.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
no
sir,
she
doesn’t,
she
would
only
accrue
seniority
for
the
period
of
time
when
she’s
actually
completed.
the
only
thing
that
the
school
teacher
loses
here
is
a
period
of
employment
where
she
loses
wages.
this
is
the
only
complaint
that
the
school
teacher
can
have
in
this
case.
now,
this
case
does
not
--
or
in
this
the
school
teacher
wishes
really
to
accomplish
the
best
of
two
worlds.
there’s
not
an
attack
here
by
the
school
teachers
on
maternity
provision
itself.
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
the
maternity
provision
was
adapted
in
part
by
school
teachers
who
participated,
women
school
teachers
who
participated
in
the
rules
adaption.
so,
we
are
not
really
here
talking
about
the
merits
or
demerits
of
maternity
leave
because
it’s
conceded
that
that
petitioner
in
this
case
wants
the
merits
of
maternity
leave.
her
only
objection
is
to,
one,
clearly
defined
the
area
and
that
is
i
wish
to
choose
the
manner
in
which
the
maternity
provision
is
implemented
as
opposed
to
having
the
school
board
make
this
choice.
and
that’s
really
the
only
issue
that’s
involved
in
this
case
and
whether
or
not
that
precise
issue
is
guaranteed
by
the
constitution.
in
addition
to
this
continuity
argument
that
i
have
presented
here,
we
don’t
wish
to
not
rely
upon
the
medical
reasons
which
justify
the
regulation.
the
record
in
this
case
and
also
the
clause
complete
in
the
fact
that
they
are
all
certain
conditions
that
occur
only
in
a
pregnant
woman
and
they
are
all
--
there
are
certain
conditions
that
are
disorders
a
pregnancy
that
can
occur
only
in
the
last
trimester
which
is
perhaps
one
reason
why
the
fifth
month
date
was
picked
out.
for
example,
toxemia,
anemia
and
hemorrhagic
conditions
related
to
the
placenta.
these
are
conditions
that
occur
only
in
a
pregnant
woman
in
these
latter
stages
of
her
pregnancy.
in
addition,
there
are
obvious
conditions
that
relate
only
to
a
pregnant
woman.
for
example,
she
has
lack
of
balance
caused
by
the
size
of
the
fetus
in
the
latter
months
of
pregnancy.
she
is
more
subject
to
falling,
her
center
of
gravity
changes
and
this
record
shows
that
there
is
the
possibility
that
a
pregnant
woman
be
subject
to
pushing
and
shelving
in
the
school
and
this
record
also
shows
that
a
pregnant
woman
will
have
to
visit
her
obstetrician
13
times
during
her
pregnancy
with
the
more
frequent
visits
being
in
the
last
several
months
of
her
pregnancy.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
yes
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
no,
the
record
does
not
show
that
your
honor.
the
record
only
touches
on
that
indirectly.
it
will
reflect
that
at
the
time
mrs.
cohen
applied
to
the
school
board
in
the
month
of
december
that
there
were
three
other
women
who
are
applying
for
an
extension
of
the
maternity
provision
in
the
same
month.
that’s
the
only
in
which
the
record
in
this
case
reflects
on
the
question
that
you’ve
asked.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
no
sir,
the
record
does
not
show.
there
was
no
statistical
data
produced
in
the
records
of
this
case
to
show
or
to
support
the
contention
that
there
were
an
increase
in
absences
of
teachers
during
the
last
trimester
of
their
pregnancy.
that
evidence
just
does
not
exist
except
for
the
fact
that
we
do
know
that
pregnancy
in
and
of
it
self
will
cause
the
teacher
to
increase
her
visits
to
her
obstetrician,
which
could
very
well
lead
to
her
absence
from
her
teaching
choice
particularly
in
the
last
trimester
that’s
involved
here.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
i
am
sorry
sir
i
didn’t
understand.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well
sir,
of
course
the
record
in
this
case
won’t
reflect
that.
look
at
allergies
as
entirely
different
situation,
because
pregnancy
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
yes
sir,
but
the
difference
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well
sir,
the
record
shows
clearly
in
this
case
that
doctor
who
testified
here
that
his
normal
hours
that
he
would
accept
patients
would
be
between
hours
of
9
and
4
o’clock
in
the
afternoon.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
i’d
have
no
idea
to
answer
to
that
your
honor.
i
do
know
that
the
doctor
who
was
deposed
in
this
case
said
he
didn’t
work
at
night
and
he
also
didn’t
work
on
the
weekends.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well
sir,
i
put
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
i
put
that
emphasis
only
because
it
points
out
clearly
that
there
is
a
likelihood
during
the
last
three
months
that
a
woman
will
be
absent
because
of
her
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
yes
sir.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well,
i’m
talking
--
it’s
in
the
last
four
months
you
are
correct,
but
i
use
generally
because
the
doctor
seems
to
break
it
up
into
trimester,
the
first,
second
and
third
and
their
testimony
relates
only
to
the
last
trimester.
but
i
think
that
there
is
nothing
magic
about
the
fifth
month,
it
could
be
the
fourth
month
or
the
fifth
month
or
the
sixth
month.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
it
could
be,
but
here
we’re
dealing
with
a
question
of
whether
or
not
one
is
grateful
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
that
could
be.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
yes
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
but
let
me
point
out
here,
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
problem
that
exist
in
the
chesterfield
county
school
board.
if
we
find
out
that
there
is
another
problem
in
terms
of
conditions
that
are
peculiar
only
to
man
or
peculiar
only
to
all
--
are
peculiar
to
all
people,
i
think
the
school
board
could
easily
regulate
that
condition.
but
here,
they
are
dealing
with
the
condition
that
know
exist
and
they
know
creates
a
problem
for
them
and
does
the
constitution
require
that
they
regulate
every
potential
condition
causing
a
disruption
in
the
school
board
or
is
the
constitution
or
does
it
only
require
that
there
would
be
a
rational
basis
or
reasonable
basis
for
the
regulation
that
we’ve
got
here.
that’s
the
issue.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
yes
sir,
and
that’s
what
i
have
tried
to
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well,
i
don’t
see
the
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
i’m
sorry
but
i
don’t
understand
the
question.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well,
i
think
the
school
board
can
very
clearly
regulate
and
direct
its
regulations
to
a
condition
of
potential
import
in
the
condition
of
potential
disruption.
the
school
board
need
not
wait
until
an
injury
occurs
to
a
pregnant
mother
in
a
school
system
during
the
last
several
months
of
pregnancy
in
order
for
them
to
justify
this
rule
as
being
rational.
they
can
regulate
as
to
potential
disruptions
that
may
occur.
i
don’t
say
that
condition
--
a
disruption
will
occur
in
every
pregnant
school
teacher.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
i
would
say
under
those
circumstances,
if
you
could
relate
the
condition
of
a
man’s
instability
with
his
ability
to
teach
which
is
a
question
in
and
of
itself,
if
you
could
relate
that
matter
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
i
believe
that
a
regulation
directed
towards
that
condition
and
to
the
facts
that
you
have
given
me
would
be
a
rational
and
reasonable
regulation.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well,
of
course
here
again
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
yes,
well
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well,
i
would
say
that
if
you
could
show
that
the
instability
that
you
are
here
--
that
you
are
talking
about
here
would
have
a
direct
effect
on
the
ability
of
teachers,
particularly
men
teachers
in
the
school
system,
you
could
have
a
regulation
directed
towards
that
but
we
don’t
have
that
here
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
we
have
got
a
condition
here
where
a
100%
of
the
people
affected
by
the
rule
are
in
fact
pregnant
and
we
do
know
one
thing,
that
they
are
going
to
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
a
100%
are
not
unable
to
teach.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
no
sir,
because
i
think
that
the
rule
here
can
be
clearly
justified
on
the
basis
that
it
accomplishes
continuity
in
the
educational
process
by
having
an
orderly
procedure
for
replacement
of
teachers
who
become
pregnant.
now,
there
is
only
one
person,
now
there
are
only
one
class
of
people
that
are
affected
by
this
rule,
and
that
is
pregnant
women
who
are
at
least
five
months
pregnant
and
who
wish
to
choose
from
the
themselves
what
date
they
will
terminate
their
employment
rather
than
having
the
school
board
terminate
their
employment,
and
that
is
the
only
class
of
person
that
is
affected
by
this
rule.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well
sir,
i
think
that
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well,
there
is
one
advantage
to
picking
five
months
and
that
the
elasticity
provision,
the
additional
four
months.
it
gives
you
some
time
to
carry
over
to
teacher.
if
you
believe
that
it’s
in
the
best
interest
of
the
school
board
that
she’d
be
allowed
to
continue
teaching
to
appear
at
the
time,
the
example
that
i
gave
may
1st,
if
you
wanted
to
continue
her
employment
for
another
month
you
could
do
so,
but
i
suppose
that
the
one
reason
that
five
months
period
of
time
was
selected
was
because
most
women
would
prefer
to
stop
teaching
after
that
fifth
month.
and
i
point
out
again
that
this
maternity
provision
provides
a
benefit
to
women
in
the
sense
that
they
can
breach
their
contract
which
i
have
entered
into
and
they
can
breach
that
contract
without
any
re-precaution.
so,
we’re
dealing
here
with
the
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
yes
sir,
that’s
correct.
but
if
it’s
going
to
be
a
balance
drawn
between
the
interest
of
the
students
and
the
interest
of
the
children
in
having
quality
education
by
preventing
disruption
and
there
is
going
to
be
a
disadvantage
mainly
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well,
that’s
exactly
what
the
school
board
is
trying
to
avoid,
a
substitute
teacher.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
they
are
trying
to
have
a
replacement
there
who
is
qualified
and
who
can
remain
with
the
school
children
for
the
rest
of
the
year,
because
having
one
teacher
throughout
the
year
is
admittedly
a
valid
educational
objective.
i
mean
the
district
judge
in
this
case
admitted,
he
said
i
will
find
or
i
will
recognize
in
this
case
that
it’s
good
for
education
to
have
one
teacher
there
throughout
the
year.
that’s
why
we
got
the
one
year
contract.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
it
doesn’t
guarantee
that,
but
it
goes
along
way
towards
making
that
transition.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well,
what
really
is
the
objective
here
is
to
prevent
--
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
what
is
really
the
objective
is
to
deal
away
with
the
disruption
which
is
caused
by
teacher
leaving
without
having
given
notice
and
the
disruption
caused
by
not
having
a
replacement
available
who
can
take
over
them
at
the
school,
at
the
classroom.
that’s
the
objective
of
the
regulation.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
nothing
except
the
facts
in
this
particular
case
your
honor.
in
the
appendix
again
at
page
114,
it
shows
that
dr.
kelly
testified,
if
he
was
able
with
his
lead
time
and
mind
to
go
out
and
solicit
and
to
hire
a
replacement
teacher
who
he
hoped
could
be
at
least
as
qualified
as
mrs.
cohen
and
who
could
take
in
and
--
come
in
and
replace
her.
and
other
than
that
example,
as
it’s
applied
to
mrs.
cohen,
there
are
no
statistics,
but
i
believe
that
the
facts,
say,
i
found
in
mrs.
cohen’s
particular
case
are
the
best
justification
for
this
regulation,
because
the
school
board
was
able
to
go
out
with
its
lead
time
and
with
its
planning
device
and
with
its
planning
tool
and
hire
a
qualified
replacement
who
is
available
to
come
in
right
after
the
christmas
recess.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
no
sir,
i
believe
the
penalties
for
the
breach
of
employment
contract
in
the
sense
that
she
agrees
at
the
outset
of
her
employment
that
she
is
going
to
teach
for
one
year.
and
as
i
have
said
before,
that’s
the
objective
to
have
a
teacher
there
for
the
entire
year,
and
i
would
think
that
under
those
circumstances
the
school
board
would
be
justified
in
not
offering
her
reemployment
because
she
has
breached
or
contract
voluntarily.
mr.
samuel
w.
hixon,
iii
well,
i
see
what
you’re
driving
at
your
honor
but
i
wouldn’t
take
that
position,
because
i
believe
that
pregnancy
is
sui
generis,
it’s
a
condition
that’s
peculiar
only
to
women
and
it’s
a
condition
which
i
believe
the
school
board
is
justified
in
treating
differently
than
any
other
condition.
and
for
that
reason,
i
don’t
think
that
a
person
that
you’ve
describe
would
have
that
claim.
now,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
asserted
that
this
is
a
sex
classification
case.
and
of
course
in
our
brief,
we
have
taken
the
position
and
strongly
represent
to
this
court
that
this
is
not
in
fact
a
classification
that’s
based
on
sex,
what
perhaps
is
triggering
the
strict
scrutiny
test.
we
don’t
have
here
a
classification
which
treats
men
and
women
different
solely
because
of
their
sex
who
are
similarly
situated.
we
have
a
condition
here
that,
or
our
regulations
that
is
directed
towards
a
particular
and
easily
definable
area
that
is
pregnant
women.
it’s
not
a
classification
based
on
sex
to
treat
men
differently
and
say
their
employment
in
the
united
state
army
where
they’re
maybe
required
to
shave
off
their
beard,
this
is
not
traditionally
known
as
a
classification
that’s
based
on
sex,
but
triggering
some
suspect
area
in
which
the
court
will
look
with
strict
scrutiny
on
the
classification
that’s
involved.
we
have
here
a
peculiar
condition
that
should
be
and
we
represent
to
this
court
should
be
handled
under
to
the
traditional
rational
basis
test.
and
for
the
reasons
that
we
have
set
forth
particularly
the
continuity
and
the
medical
conditions
that
exist
and
wanting,
we
would
pray
that
the
opinion
of
the
fourth
circuit
be
sustained
and
be
upheld.
