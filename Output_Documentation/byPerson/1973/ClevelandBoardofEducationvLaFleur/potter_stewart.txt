it’s
very
typical
is
it
not
of
equal
protection
clause
litigation?
usually
when
you
are
dealing
with
the
state
statute,
for
example,
you
have
no
legislative
history
and
the
--
then
when
it
says
the
validity
of
the
statute
is
attacked
and
is
violating
the
equal
protection
clause,
then
the
effort
is
made
post
talk,
if
you
will,
to
for
mine
the
rational
justifications
for
the
law.
that’s
a
very
typical,
that’s
what
you
find
all
typically
and
equal
protection
clause
litigation,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
indeed
the
law
generally
is
that
if
any
rational
support
can
be
found
for
the
law,
then
it
doesn’t
violate
the
equal
protection
clause.
that’s
a
so-called
conventional
test.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
those
are
found
to
be
very
widespread,
does
that
evidence
--
they
are
arbitrary
or
capricious?
wouldn’t
that,
if
it’s
evidence
of
anything
being
be
that
there
might
be
some
rationality
behind
it?
justice
potter
stewart
if
you
found,
for
example,
one
exceptional
school
board
in
the
whole
country
that
had
this
kind
of
regulation,
you’d
have
a
pretty
good
case
going
in
i
should
suppose
that
it’s
arbitrary
and
capricious,
but
if
you
half
of
the
school
boards
in
the
country
with
these
sorts
of
regulations,
i
suppose
the
presumption
going
in
would
be
that
there
must
be
some
sort
of
rationality
behind
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
when
is
the
noticed
required
in
chesterfield?
justice
potter
stewart
yes
but
when
must
you
give
notice?
justice
potter
stewart
now
you
would
think
that
would
have
a
goody
old
ado,
that
would
have
a
goody
old
bearing
on
the
continuity
argument,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
not
just
the
day
before?
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
that
means
two
months
notice,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
two
months
notice?
justice
potter
stewart
two
months
prior
to
leaving.
justice
potter
stewart
were
there
individual
employment
contracts
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
do
the
contracts
have
anything
to
say
about
this
subject.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
might
have
stipulated
it
but
you
didn’t
and
it
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
merits
of
this
case
whether
or
not
this
teacher
agreed
in
advance
that
this
would
be
a
term
and
condition
of
her
contract,
do
you
know
or
don’t
you?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
hixon,
i
could
fully
understand
your
continuity
argument,
if
the
chesterfield
county
school
board
had
a
rule
that
no
teacher
who
anticipated
being
pregnant
during
that
school
year
would
be
hired.
or
if
you
required
immediate
notice
as
soon
as
the
teacher
knew
she
was
pregnant.
but
here,
it
doesn’t
seem
that
to
me
--
at
least
you
tell
me
why
i’m
mistaking
this
that
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference
so
far
as
your
continuity
arguments
goes
whether
the
teacher
leaves
after
four
months
pregnant
or
after
eight
months
pregnant
or
after
eight
months
and
three
weeks
pregnant
so
far
as
continuity
goes,
because
the
pregnancy
is
going
to
be
just
by
the
ordinary
pattern
of
events.
could
be
anytime
during
the
school
year
and
the
four
months
could
be
anytime
during
the
school
year
when
you
take
a
large
sample
of
pregnant
women
teachers.
justice
potter
stewart
right
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
now,
whether
or
not
it
could,
at
least
your
continuity
argument
would
have
great
force
in
support
of
that
sort
of
a
regulation
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
you
were
not
faced
with
here.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
hirschkop
is
your
--
it’s
your
primary
submission,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
compulsory
termination
after
the
fifth
month
of
pregnancy
is
what
violates
the
equal
protection
clause,
is
that
right?
it’s
not
the
notice
requirement,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
said
that
is
also,
not
just
the
compulsory
departure
date.
and
so
then,
i
guess
you
didn’t
answer
--
you
either
didn’t
hear
my
question
or
didn’t
answer
it
clearly.
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
the
notice
requirement
confined
to
pregnancy,
i
thought
you
said
you
don’t
think
it’s
unconstitutional.
justice
potter
stewart
then
you
were
--
then
i
mistakenly
understood
you
to
say
that
your
objection
is
the
compulsory
termination.
justice
potter
stewart
so
it’s
not
only
the
compulsory
separation
after
the
fifth
month
that
you
submit
violates
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
not.
justice
potter
stewart
but
there
is
nothing
inexorable
about
that
as
there
is
about
pregnancy,
they’re
quit
different,
in
fact
different.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
whole
point
is
that
when
you
--
when
a
woman
who
is
pregnant,
she
doesn’t
have
a
choice
as
to
when
that
baby
is
going
to
arrive,
does
she?

the
respondents
in
number
72-777
were
female
public
school

by
the
board

of
cleveland,

the
petitioner
in
number
72-1129
was
a
female
school
teacher
employed
by
the
school
board
of
chesterfield
county,
virginia.
during
the
1970,
1971
school
year,
each
informed
her
local
school
board,
that
she
was
pregnant.
each
was
compelled
by
a
mandatory
maternity
leave
rule
to
quit
her
job
without
pay
several
months
before
the
expected
birth
of
her
child.
each
thereafter
bought
suit
in
a
federal
district
court,
challenging
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
school
board's
mandatory
termination
rule.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
ultimately
held
unconstitutional,
the
cleveland
rule,
that
requires
every
pregnant
school
teacher
to
take
a
maternity
leave
without
pay,
beginning
five
months
before
the
expected
birth
of
her
child.
the
court

ultimately
upheld
the
constitutionality
of

rule,
that
requires
a
pregnant
teacher
to
leave
her
job
at
least
four
months
before
the

of

child.
we
granted
certiorari
in
both
cases
to

this

authority
upon

for
the
reasons
stated
in

in

opinion
filed

we
hold
that
the
mandatory
termination
provisions
of
the
cleveland
and
chesterfield
county
maternity
regulations
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
of
their
use
of
unwarranted
conclusive
presumptions
that
seriously
burden
the
exercise
of
protected
constitutional
liberty.
accordingly
the
judgment
in
number

is
