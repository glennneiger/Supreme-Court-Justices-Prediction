mr.

you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
listen
to
the
different
matter
when
you
are
dealing
with
situation
like
this
where
as
you
suggest
the
terminal
period
is
predictable
and
you
have
a
predictable
situation
all
the
way
through
in
terms
of
medical
testimony.
now,
when
you
talk
about
a
man
with
his
ankle
or
his
leg
in
a
cast,
that’s
one
isolated
situation,
but
with
a
pregnancy,
you
have
a
whole
series
of
consequences
which
are
within
the
range
of
possibilities,
do
you
not?

justice
warren
e.

we?
chief

there
a
state

the

to

whether
their
school
teachers

a
buyers
market
or
in
sellers
market?
chief

warren
e.

five
years
ago
or
more
or
less
teachers
were
almost
impossible
to
come
by,
isn’t
meant
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.

and
now
there
maybe
is
somewhat
of
a
surplus?
