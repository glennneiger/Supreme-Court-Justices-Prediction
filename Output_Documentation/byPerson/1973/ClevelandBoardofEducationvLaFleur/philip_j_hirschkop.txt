mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
clearly
presented
as
one
of
sex
discrimination,
and
the
issue
joined
between
the
two
parties
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
sex
discrimination
and
the
fourth
circuit
very
clearly
went
to
that
issue
also.
we
submit
to
the
court
especially
in
light
of
the
foregoing
argument,
one
that
just
proceeded
that
there
is
no
question
of
sex
discrimination
in
this
case,
that
the
only
basis
for
these
regulations,
in
fact
are
of
appearance.
now,
on
the
course
of
this
case,
the
cohen
case,
we
had
opportunity
to
depose
the
school
board.
now,
we
took
each
deposition
separately.
before
the
lawyers
present
in
the
case
could
sit
down
with
them
and
chat
about
legal
rationale
where
they
sort
other
opinions
and
could
then
form
opinions
as
to
the
basis
of
the
school
regulation.
three
members
of
the
board
and
the
superintendent
believed
the
rate
of
absenteeism
of
a
teacher
increases
in
the
last
four
months
of
pregnancy
and
the
references
are
on
page
4
of
our
brief
that
i
am
referring
to
here.
as
to
the
appendix
references
where
there
are
different
testimonies
is
found.
they
all
conceded
however
that
they
had
no
experience
or
statistics
whatever
with
that.
in
fact,
since
they
terminated
women
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
month,
they
had
no
idea
what
the
absentee
rate
would
be
in
the
last
three
months,
the
last
trimester
of
pregnancy.
but
in
point
of
fact,
both
doctors
were
clear
it
would
be
lower
if
anything
in
the
last
three
months.
the
difficult
three
months
of
a
pregnancy
are
the
first
three
months.
the
superintendent
and
three
members
felt
that
it
would
be
dangerous
for
a
pregnant
woman
to
walk
down
school
halls
and
climb
steps.
they
later
or
at
the
same
time,
they
discussed
the
question
fire
regulations
and
indeed
a
fire
marshall
was
put
on
the
stand
with
the
trial
this
matter
to
show
that
there
occasionally
were
some
fires
in
schools
and
were
fire
drills.
there
was
some
perhaps
rather
ludicrous
questioning
in
retrospect
about
why
--
what
do
you
do
about
fat
men.
they
said
women
who
are
pregnant
can’t
fit
through
narrow
places;
we
say
“what
do
you
do
about
the
fat
men?”
and
then
three
members
in
the
school
board
felt
that
it
was
not
good
for
students
to
see
woman
whose
pregnancy
becomes
conspicuous
to
others
and
indeed
we
quoted
ludicrous
language
of
one
of
them
about
children
seeing
this
teacher
of
11th
grade
history
and
thinking
she
may
have
a
watermelon
in
her
belly.
now,
that
comment
perhaps
shouldn’t
be
in
the
supreme
court
brief
other
than
it
was
stated
in
testimony,
but
it
points
out
what
is
really
the
basis
of
these
regulations.
when
we
say
the
continuity
of
teaching
argument
is
the
real
basis
of
these
things
as
the
appellees
would
have
you
believe
from
their
brief,
we
must
submit
to
this
court
it
is
just
not
so.
they
are
legal
arguments,
thought
up
in
retrospect.
the
convincing
aspect
to
that
is
in
page
26
of
our
brief,
it’s
page
116
of
the
appendix
where
superintendent
kelly,
in
questioning
by
the
court,
by
judge
marage
(ph),
agreed
that
he
had
thought
of
that
reason
in
retrospect
at
the
time
of
litigation,
that
buttress
litigation.
indeed
it’s
obvious
that
wouldn’t
have
been
the
reason.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
it
is
not
unusual
your
honor
where
it
differs
here.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
only
if
your
honor
--
only
if
the
court
applies
the
rational
basis
test.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
the
compelling
interest
test,
as
applied
to
this
case,
we
submit
it
would
never
succeed,
although
we’d
submit
it
won’t
succeed
on
the
rational
basis
test
your
honor.
justice
stewart,
you
have
to
look
i
think
at
this
other
matter
they
raised
and
that’s
the
appearance,
because
that’s
the
real
background
of
these
things.
there
was
a
question
raised
in
previous
case
where
at
least
discussion
of
the
widespread
nature
of
these
type
of
regulations,
and
indeed
they
are
very
widespread,
and
maybe
the
real
importance
to
this
case
outside
of
just
the
question
of
law
of
the
test
to
be
applied
under
the
equal
protection
clause
is
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
teachers
that
is
subject
to
just
this
type
of
arbitrary
regulation.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
no
sir
i
think
not.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
i
would
think
not
your
honor.
it
would
be
a
logical
inference
but
i
would
say
not
a
legal
one.
for
instance
in,
the
mixed
marriage
cases,
there
were
26
states
with
mix
marriage
laws,
in
the
segregation
cases,
there
were
many
states
for
segregation
laws,
but
that
didn’t
lend
validity
to
those
laws.
with
regard
to
these
regulations,
there
is
a
trend
away
from
it.
if
there
is
any
reference
to
be
drawn
is
the
overwhelming
weight
of
authority
against
these
laws.
just
today,
civil
service
commission’s
bureau
of
policies
and
standards
has
recommended
against
having
such
standards
at
all
in
the
hiring
laws
of
the
employees
of
the
government.
and
as
we
cite
labor
department
and
defense
department
and
other
standards
where
these
are
a
trend
away
in
virginia,
every
county
had
them
at
one
time.
the
richmond
school
board
does
not
now
have
such
a
policy,
although
in
rico
and
the
surrounding
counties
too.
i’d
submit
to
the
court
that
we
can’t,
from
the
widespread
nature
of
the
laws,
draw
any
inference
at
this
time,
the
49%
figure
i
am
sure,
but
i
should
think
will
be
higher
and
all
kinder.
it
does
apply
to
major
school
boards
and
i
have
experience
in
this
case
and
a
companion
case
now
coming
up
through
the
fourth
circuit,
a
class
action
in
virginia
indicates
that
the
fact
that
all
the
counties
in
virginia
have
such
a
regulation.
there
was
a
question
raised
as
to
the
five
months
versus
another
time
and
it’s
conceded
in
this
case
that
there
is
nothing
magical
about
five
months.
it’s
just
they
have
to
draw
a
specific
time
so
they
locked
on
five
months,
but
it
could
be
four
or
sticks
to
seven
in
a
testimony
or
so
in
our
case.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
well,
they
require
as
soon
as
you
know,
but
you
can’t
--
you
must
leave
after
the
fifth
months.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
i
don’t
have
the
precise
date,
i’ll
get
that
your
honor.
as
far
as
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
it
would
your
honor
and
we
don’t
resist
a
notice.
this
was
raised
in
the
prior
case.
we
have
no
question
that
school
board
may
ask
people
who
have
any
kind
of
disability
which
they
know
in
advance.
we
require
them
living
school
at
one
point
to
another
to
notify
the
employer
of
a
pending
–-
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
oh
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
we
have
no
problem
with
that.
that’s
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
there
is
a
separate
issue
which
again
points
out
the
arbitrariness
of
it
on
the
return.
the
regulations
in
this
jurisdiction,
in
this
school
board,
say
that
they
will
return
--
following
their
pregnancy,
they
can
return
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
year
basically.
now,
in
depositions,
it
was
pointed
out
that
they
return
to
a
position
open
at
the
point
at
the
time
they
returned,
if
there
is
a
position
open.
plus
the
regulation
clearly
shows
they
are
not
guaranteed
return
to
the
same
job,
the
same
teaching
position
for
which
they
originally
contracted
and
they
must
file
a
certificate
or
give
the
school
assurance
that
the
trial
will
be
taken
cared
off
okay
and
of
course
this
starts
smacking
the
martin
marietta
case,
because
men
don’t
have
to
give
such
assurances
as
who
is
to
care
for
an
already
born
baby,
which
again,
i
think
points
out
what
they
are
really
concerned
about
is
the
old
fashioned
look
of
women
and
child
raring
and
child
birth,
which
meant
to
the
court
that
the
record
is
abundant
here
not
just,
because
of
watermelons
and
things
like
that.
your
honor,
on
the
notice
dated
at
six
months
prior
to
the
expected
birth,
they
should
get
nervous.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir,
at
the
end
of
the
third
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir,
and
we
have
no
problem
with
when
the
notice
is,
they
may
say
notice
six
months
and
notice
eight
months,
that’s
not
the
problem
we
have
in
this
case.
the
problem
essential
is
just
no
reason
to
make
women
leave
work
when
they
are
perfectly
capable
of
working
other
than
these
old
fashion
notions
of
child
birth.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
the
contracts
have
a
clause,
i
don’t
know,
i
tried
to
find,
i
don’t
have
the
exact
contract
here,
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
but
the
contracts
have
a
clause
referring
to
the
sick
leave
policies.
now,
perhaps
to
the
case
we
would
have
stipulated
in
the
court
below
that
even
if
there
was
a
specific
section
in
the
contract
outlining
this
that
that
wouldn’t
be
bar,
there
have
been
other
teacher
cases
with
these
contract
provisions
where
they
can’t
contract
the
way
your
constitution
rights.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
no.
your
honor
there
is
a
section
on
the
contract
on
the
sick
leave
policies
and
a
section
contract
on
the
school
board
policies
that
they
will
adhere
to
the
school
board
policies.
i
don’t
believe
there
was
section
in
the
contracts
specifically
on
maternity
leave
policies.
now,
they
do
have
in
the
school
board
policies
in
the
teacher’s
handbook.
the
maternity
leave
policies
spelled
out
specifically
as
we
have
it
here
as
it
appears
at
page
i
think
20
and
21
of
our
appendix.
we
submit
to
the
court
in
this
case,
there
was
medical
testimony
that
the
woman
could
teach,
in
this
case
her
own
principal
asked
that
she’d
be
allowed
to
finish
out
the
semester.
in
this
case,
she
would
asked
to
continue
first
--
until
april
1st
which
is
shortly
before
the
expected
date
of
birth
and
later
went
before
the
school
board
and
asked
at
least
could
she
stay
until
mid
january,
january
20th
i
believe
when
the
semester
would
end
so
she
could
finish
the
semester
with
her
students.
they
forced
her
to
leave
on
december
the
18th.
now
apparently
just
before
the
christmas
vacation
although
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
indicate
they
did
it
for
that
reason
alone.
the
facts
still
remains
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
the
continuity
argument.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
but
there
still
other
arguments
advised
the
time
of
deposition.
there
is
nothing
to
show
the
absentee
argument
and
give
any
truth
or
validity
to
that.
there
is
nothing
to
show
the
injury
argument.
indeed,
if
you
start
comparing
this
to
other
matters,
for
instances
a
man
with
his
leg
in
a
cast
as
a
result
of
an
skiing
accident
or
what
have
you.
he
certainly
wouldn’t
be
any
great
benefit
in
the
middle
of
a
fire
drill
running
down
the
hall
along
crutches,
but
there
is
no
prescription
against
him.
with
regard
to
the
predictability
of
disabilities
which
was
raised
earlier.
again,
this
is
discrimination
going
after
a
select
class,
which
i
think
just
lands
to
our
position
that
it’s
appearance
they
are
really
concerned
about.
certainly
a
woman,
once
pregnant
is
able
t
predict,
through
medical
testimony
or
medical
doctors
can
predict
the
exact
date
of
birth.
if
so,
can
most
people
for
cosmetic
surgery
and
many
other
things.
now,
there
is
no
regulation
on
cosmetic
surgery.
a
man
or
a
woman
could
make
a
choice
that
we
want
certain
cosmetic
surgery.
and
then
pick
a
date
and
go
to
the
school
board,
take
their
leave
of
absence,
be
out
as
long
as
they
want
in
essence.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
medical
evidence
in
this
case
says
basically
there
is
no
disability
during
the
teaching
period.
now,
the
one
thing
that
there
is
there
is
certain
anxiety,
but
there
is
nothing
before
this
court.
and
we
submit
there
could
be
nothing,
which
shows
that
despite
the
anxiety
of
the
condition
of
pregnancy,
it
materially
interferes
with
the
teacher’s
ability
to
teach.
quite
the
contrary,
we
have
amicus
in
this
case
of
the
national
education
association,
as
an
association
of
over
a
million
members
representing
teachers
who
are
not
here
to
blindly
say
they
got
to
work,
no
matter
what
happens.
there
is
in
conscience
i
believe
said
that
education
is
not
hampered
by
teachers
being
in
school
who
are
pregnant
and
i
think
we
could
recognize
the
overwhelming
number
of
members
that
they
have
are
women
teachers.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
no
sir,
and
they
amicus
to
the
other
side,
but
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
to
i
think
in
this
case
that
the
court
has
in
this
case
decide
is
what
this
representing
to
us
that
this
is
really
a
continuity
argument
and
all
true,
does
it
hold
any
water?
we
submit
it
does
not.
even
if
you
put
aside
the
depositions
and
deal
with
it
as
it’s
before
the
court
right
now
that
--
let’s
look
at
this
point
in
the
constitutional
framework,
if
there
is
any
validity
to
that
statute.
let’s
see
if
we
can
find
a
reasonable
basis.
i
submit
you
cannot.
as
in
the
case
before
us,
our
teacher
was
terminated
when
it
disrupted
continuity.
in
fact,
while
they
have
an
element
in
this
regulation
that
a
teacher
can
be
continued
past
the
fifth
months,
if
the
superintendent
determines
it’s
for
the
good
of
the
school
system,
we
also
have
the
testimony
that
he
had
the
case
that
he
just
doesn’t
continue
anybody
pass
the
fifth
months.
and
this
case
here,
in
a
day
when
there
is
a
wide
market,
lots
of
teachers
readily
available,
where
they
terminate
a
woman
in
december
who
could
have
finished
the
term
and
go
on
right
through.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
we’d
submit
that
should
not
be
your
honor
but
their
argument
is
buttress
by
the
buyers
and
sellers
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir,
in
certain
fields
especially
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
in
fact
in
the
all
fields,
but
your
honor,
it’s
their
argument
that
i’m
trying
to
get
to
that
they
believe
you
have
to
have
the
continuity
because
you
might
not
have
a
teacher
available
later
on.
and
if
you
put
aside,
where
the
teacher
is
available
or
not,
the
whole
continuity
argument
would
fall
on
its
face
if
there
are
plenty
of
teachers
available.
either
way,
there’s
just
no
question
of
this
being
a
discriminatory
statute,
if
not
only
looked
at
as
applying
to
woman
teachers
compared
to
other
teachers,
but
is
applying
to
the
teaching
profession
as
compared
to
the
other
profession.
i
think
an
incident
that
happened
in
the
course
of
this
litigation
is
very
fruitful
here.
when
we
showed
up
to
argue
this
case
in
the
fourth
circuit,
judge
young’s
law
clerk
who
was
the
district
judge
sitting
by
designation
was
in
her
six
month
of
pregnancy
and
anticipated
working
through
eight
month
of
pregnancy.
now,
what
is
so
important
about
teachers
that’s
not
so
important
about
law
clerks
or
if
such
a
time
come
as
we
--
clearly
will
come
when
a
woman
or
more
that
one
woman
rise
to
this
bench,
will
this
court
whoever
determines
such
regulation
say
you
can’t
sit
beyond
your
fifth
month
of
pregnancy.
or
will
you
say
that
judges
on
trial
courts
or
does
anywhere
acquire
that
of
court
clerks
here,
we
believe
they
do
not,
nor
thus
the
government
require
it.
just
because
teachers
in
a
unique
situation
historically
of
the
year
to
your
contract,
there
is
no
reason,
they
should
submit,
to
that
type
of
discrimination
which
is
practiced
nowhere
else,
whether
it
be
in
the
court
system
the
civil
service
system
at
this
time,
or
it’s
just
in
an
anachronism
that
must
be
done
away
with
it.
thank
you.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir.
the
court
has
asked
several
questions
about
the
leave
policies
there
at
page
20
and
21
of
our
appendix.
i
point
out
that
reemployment
is
not
automatic
but
only
comes
after
a
declaration
of
eligibility,
which
includes
a
certificate
from
the
teacher
or
assurance
from
the
teacher
that
she
is
going
to
care
for
her
child
or
can
care
for
a
child
so
that
doesn’t
materially
impair
her
ability
to
function.
as
far
as
this
leeway
that
teachers
have,
we
submit
it’s
not
so
after
the
fifth
month.
at
page
117
of
the
appendix,
we
have
the
testimony
of
the
superintendent
that
no
teachers
on
board
after
the
fifth
month,
it’s
their
very
experience
which
gives
the
light
to
that
belief
that
the
mere
fact
that’s
there
is
that
its
use.
now,
we
disagree
basically
with
the
other
side
on
the
--
what
is
the
issue
of
the
case?
no
question
about
that.
all
of
this
teacher
wants,
all
the
women
want
who
want
this
thing
to
set
aside
is
to
be
treated
equally
with
other
people.
and
they’re
not
treated
equally,
because
they
single
out
this
one
sex
related
disability
in
terms
of
fact
that
when
a
pregnancy
actually
occurs
the
woman
has
to
be
gone.
the
rest
is
just
imagined.
for
instance
mr.
hixon’s
argument
where
she’s
going
to
go
to
the
doctor
13
times,
as
someone
recognized
here
in
the
court,
you
can
go
to
a
doctor
at
other
times,
even
though
the
doctor
testified
he
does
not
have
saturday
hours.
he
is
only
up
nothing
to
4:30,
mrs.
cohen
testified
that’s
when
she
tried
to
get
there
and
we
put
her
record
before
the
court
in
the
district
court,
she
had
missed
two
days
both
related
to
colds
that
she
had
in
the
five
months,
which
is
part
of
those
13
days
in
compass
i
believe,
not
missed
anytime.
but
even
if
she
had,
so
what?
people
miss
time
for
all
sorts
of
things.
could
they
pass
a
rule
against
a
generic
or
a
race
related
disease?
for
instance,
could
they
have
a
rule
of
people
with
sickle
cell
anemia
with
a
tendency
of
the
sickle
cell
anemia
could
no
longer
teach
in
the
school
system
when
we
know
that
that’s
basically
a
race
related
disease,
and
yet
give
people
with
cancer
or
other
diseases
preferential
treatment.
they
could
not,
i
submit
to
the
court,
and
get
away
with
it.
we
have
a
law
in
virginia
which
is
cited
at
page
--
appendix
5,
on
a
dismissal
law
which
is
statewide,
and
where
there’s
a
disability
as
shown
by
competent
medical
evidence,
a
person
can
be
dismissed.
now,
the
state
treats
all
disabilities
equally
and
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
women
should
be
treated
equally.
they
have
no
question
singled
out
one
class
of
persons,
and
i
think
to
argue
whether
it’s
sex
related
is
foolishness.
it
is
clearly
sex
related.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
oh,
no
sir,
no
sir,
for
the
--
the
court
has
raised
this
several
times,
i
think
we
should
be
very
clear,
we
do
not
object
to
the
notice
requirement
and
in
fact
do
not
object
to
a
set
date
requirement,
they
can’t
fix
it
by
law
this
way.
in
other
words,
they
can
have
a
requirement
that
if
a
person
is
going
to
suffer
some
disability,
which
will
force
them
to
leave
teaching
during
the
course
of
the
year,
that
person
must,
as
soon
as
they
know
about
it
or
within
some
specified
date
prior
to
disability
departure
time,
notify
the
employer,
the
school
board
in
this
case,
and
in
fact
even
fix
a
departure
date.
now,
that
will
take
care
of
what
they
say,
we
want
to
plan
ahead
to
replace
the
person.
the
basic
problem
--
there
is
no
problem
with
that.
what
the
problem
is
they
single
out
one
class
of
people.
they
say
“you
must
give
us
a
departure
date
and
no
one
else
must”,
and
that
is
discrimination.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
no
sir,
we
have
no
objection.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
we
think
it
is
unconstitutional,
if
they
confine
it
to
pregnancy.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
well,
that
we
object
to
that
where
it’s
confined
to
pregnancy
also.
if
they
have
it
for
all
people
with
disabilities,
as
the
state
law
has
it,
where
that
disability
is
job
related
and
would
meet
the
due
process
requirements,
and
treated
all
people
the
same,
men
and
women,
female
related
disabilities
and
male
related
disabilities,
it
would
not
file
with
equal
protection.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir,
what
we
submit
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
it
is
not
that.
what
we
submit
violates
it,
is
the
fact
they
limit
it
just
to
women.
they
brought
it
down
to
one
class,
the
compulsory
--
the
notice
requirement
and
the
compulsory
leaving
requirement.
now
taking
the
fifth
month
is
purely
arbitrary,
as
the
court
has
recognized.
they
could
take
the
eight
month
or
the
second
month.
they
just
arbitrarily
and
virtually
flipped
a
coin
to
get
to
the
fifth
month
as
the
testimony
indicates
in
this
case,
but
what
we
object
to
your
honor
is
they
have
singled
out
women
for
treatment
that
men
don’t
receive.
in
this
case
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
cosmetic
surgery
your
honor.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes,
but
it
will
necessitate
you
being
in
the
hospital
and
being
out
of
the
job
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
no
sir,
there
are
some
male
related
diseases
that
judge
winter
points
out
in
dissenting
opinion
of
fourth
circuit,
which
i
am
not
medically
familiar,
but
there
are
questionably
a
number
of
medical
conditions
where
you
have
a
choice
as
to
when
you
will
have
an
operation
and
you
can
go
to
the
school
and
say,
look
i
am
going
to
have
an
operation
either
in
six
weeks
or
two
in
months
or
three
months.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
no
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
that’s
the
argument.
we
debate
that;
we
say
it
is
not
true.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
oh
yes
sir,
i
exceed
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
i
don’t
have
one
your
honor.
my
medical
knowledge
is
that
limited.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
your
honor
i
say
it’s
not
similar,
i
say
it’s
not
true.
i
said
pregnant
woman
can
teach
as
well
as
any
other
person
in
the
school
system.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
well,
the
doctor
said
we
were
right
in
the
record.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
well,
your
honor
they
say
i
am
wrong,
neither
do
the
doctors
say,
i
am
right,
but
now
we
look
at
the
disabilities.
if
a
man
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
no
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
okay.
i
sometimes
have
difficulty
with
that
your
honor,
but
assuming
there
is
some
difficulty
in
woman
teaching
while
she
is
pregnant,
there
is
equally
difficulty
with
other
people
teaching
with
broken
legs,
even
though
they
won’t
be
gone,
now
you
are
talking
about
the
elements
of
the
teaching
itself.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes,
but
there
is
no
special
regulation
on
them.
teaching
with
bad
backs,
teaching
with
heart
impairments,
teaching
with
other
type
of
impairments.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir,
only
insofar
as
they
single
it
out
from
other
matters.
if
they
would
go
by
the
state
law,
and
say
where
a
disability
is
such
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
well,
it
doesn’t
male
related
then,
it
could
be
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
it
could
be
a
(inaudible)
your
honor.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
i
can
only
refer
you
to
judge
winter’s
dissenting
opinion
where
he
does
indicate
some
medical
disabilities
that
men
suffer.
but
again
i
point
your
honor
to
the
fact
that
we
are
making
an
assumption
that
woman
can’t
teach
during
pregnancy,
which
the
record
is
the
opposite
of.
the
record
says
they
can
teach.
doctor
don
who
was
the
head
of
the
medical
college
of
virginia
section
on
gynecology
and
obstetrician
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
insofar
it’s
unsupported
by
the
record,
yes
sir.
now,
we
say
it
is
unsupported
by
record
to
the
contrary
a
very
noted
physician
in
fact
two
of
them
in
virginia.
one
of
them
even
had,
i
think
judge
marage
pointed
out,
delivered
his
own
baby
is
called
dr.
forrest,
but
the
fact
is
the
record
says
just
the
contrary,
the
assumption
you’d
had
me
make
your
honor
that
a
woman
can’t
teach.
and
our
basic
problem
with
this
is
that
they
single
out
women
for
special
treatment
that
(inaudible).
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
they
could
draw
a
line
on
notice
your
honor.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
termination?
well,
according
to
the
medical
testimony
here,
they
couldn’t
draw
the
line.
it
would
be
up
to
the
person
as
in
any
other
situation
to
say
that
they
can
teach
until
such
time.
now,
if
they
had
--
as
they
can
no
longer
adequately
carry
out
their
duties.
if
they
had
a
regulation
that
a
person
who
apparently
couldn’t
carry
out
the
duties,
because
of
an
impending
disability,
which
pregnancy
would
be
one
of
the
obvious
impending
disabilities,
would
have
to
give
notice,
and
then
in
fact
would
have
to
present
a
medical
certificate
or
submit
to
an
examination
of
the
school
doctor,
that
would
be
reasonable
if
it
was
applied
across
the
board.
the
main
problem
her
is
they
picked
out
just
one
thing
to
harp
on
which
is
unconstitutional
your
honor.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
oh
no
sir,
they
have
a
state
law,
they
could
operate
under
that.
if
disability
is
such
that
the
person
can’t
carry
out
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
i
will
accept
that.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
in
some
people
it
is.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
it’s
not
for
me
to
accept
personally
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
they
cannot
say
that
a
person
cannot
teach,
because
pregnant,
in
any
way
they
say
a
person
can’t
teach
because
they
got
a
cold.
now,
cold
can
result
to
pneumonia.
the
statistics
in
this
case
are
lot
more
hours
lost
from
teaching
for
colds
than
during
pregnancy,
statistics
that
we
have
from
the
labor
department.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
not
a
surgical
type
leave
which
required
an
operation
but
of
course
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
well
of
course
the
statistics
that
absenteeism
itself
from
the
labor
department
had
pregnancy
is
one
of
the
lower
causes,
but
it
didn’t
include
the
actual
period
the
woman
was
going
for
the
birth
itself.
it
included
the
period
that
was
still
employed
during
which
they
would
miss
for
a
doctors
appointments
or,
get
the
questions
asked
this
side,
the
job
related,
during
job
related
times,
they
are
missing
because
of
illness
as
something
during
the
pregnancy.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
not
for
operable
disabilities
your
honor.
i
would
not
personally
have
that
knowledge.
i
am
not
that
familiar
with
the
record,
although
i
did
read
it,
but
not
for
operable
disabilities.
but
in
terms
of
overall
disabilities,
in
other
words
time
missed
on
job
itself,
there
are
far
greater
causes.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
we
have
that
statistic
in
the
record
your
honor
from
the
department
of
labor.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
clearly
presented
as
one
of
sex
discrimination,
and
the
issue
joined
between
the
two
parties
as
to
whether
or
not
it
is
sex
discrimination
and
the
fourth
circuit
very
clearly
went
to
that
issue
also.
we
submit
to
the
court
especially
in
light
of
the
foregoing
argument,
one
that
just
proceeded
that
there
is
no
question
of
sex
discrimination
in
this
case,
that
the
only
basis
for
these
regulations,
in
fact
are
of
appearance.
now,
on
the
course
of
this
case,
the
cohen
case,
we
had
opportunity
to
depose
the
school
board.
now,
we
took
each
deposition
separately.
before
the
lawyers
present
in
the
case
could
sit
down
with
them
and
chat
about
legal
rationale
where
they
sort
other
opinions
and
could
then
form
opinions
as
to
the
basis
of
the
school
regulation.
three
members
of
the
board
and
the
superintendent
believed
the
rate
of
absenteeism
of
a
teacher
increases
in
the
last
four
months
of
pregnancy
and
the
references
are
on
page
4
of
our
brief
that
i
am
referring
to
here.
as
to
the
appendix
references
where
there
are
different
testimonies
is
found.
they
all
conceded
however
that
they
had
no
experience
or
statistics
whatever
with
that.
in
fact,
since
they
terminated
women
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
month,
they
had
no
idea
what
the
absentee
rate
would
be
in
the
last
three
months,
the
last
trimester
of
pregnancy.
but
in
point
of
fact,
both
doctors
were
clear
it
would
be
lower
if
anything
in
the
last
three
months.
the
difficult
three
months
of
a
pregnancy
are
the
first
three
months.
the
superintendent
and
three
members
felt
that
it
would
be
dangerous
for
a
pregnant
woman
to
walk
down
school
halls
and
climb
steps.
they
later
or
at
the
same
time,
they
discussed
the
question
fire
regulations
and
indeed
a
fire
marshall
was
put
on
the
stand
with
the
trial
this
matter
to
show
that
there
occasionally
were
some
fires
in
schools
and
were
fire
drills.
there
was
some
perhaps
rather
ludicrous
questioning
in
retrospect
about
why
--
what
do
you
do
about
fat
men.
they
said
women
who
are
pregnant
can’t
fit
through
narrow
places;
we
say
“what
do
you
do
about
the
fat
men?”
and
then
three
members
in
the
school
board
felt
that
it
was
not
good
for
students
to
see
woman
whose
pregnancy
becomes
conspicuous
to
others
and
indeed
we
quoted
ludicrous
language
of
one
of
them
about
children
seeing
this
teacher
of
11th
grade
history
and
thinking
she
may
have
a
watermelon
in
her
belly.
now,
that
comment
perhaps
shouldn’t
be
in
the
supreme
court
brief
other
than
it
was
stated
in
testimony,
but
it
points
out
what
is
really
the
basis
of
these
regulations.
when
we
say
the
continuity
of
teaching
argument
is
the
real
basis
of
these
things
as
the
appellees
would
have
you
believe
from
their
brief,
we
must
submit
to
this
court
it
is
just
not
so.
they
are
legal
arguments,
thought
up
in
retrospect.
the
convincing
aspect
to
that
is
in
page
26
of
our
brief,
it’s
page
116
of
the
appendix
where
superintendent
kelly,
in
questioning
by
the
court,
by
judge
marage
(ph),
agreed
that
he
had
thought
of
that
reason
in
retrospect
at
the
time
of
litigation,
that
buttress
litigation.
indeed
it’s
obvious
that
wouldn’t
have
been
the
reason.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
it
is
not
unusual
your
honor
where
it
differs
here.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
only
if
your
honor
--
only
if
the
court
applies
the
rational
basis
test.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
the
compelling
interest
test,
as
applied
to
this
case,
we
submit
it
would
never
succeed,
although
we’d
submit
it
won’t
succeed
on
the
rational
basis
test
your
honor.
justice
stewart,
you
have
to
look
i
think
at
this
other
matter
they
raised
and
that’s
the
appearance,
because
that’s
the
real
background
of
these
things.
there
was
a
question
raised
in
previous
case
where
at
least
discussion
of
the
widespread
nature
of
these
type
of
regulations,
and
indeed
they
are
very
widespread,
and
maybe
the
real
importance
to
this
case
outside
of
just
the
question
of
law
of
the
test
to
be
applied
under
the
equal
protection
clause
is
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
teachers
that
is
subject
to
just
this
type
of
arbitrary
regulation.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
no
sir
i
think
not.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
i
would
think
not
your
honor.
it
would
be
a
logical
inference
but
i
would
say
not
a
legal
one.
for
instance
in,
the
mixed
marriage
cases,
there
were
26
states
with
mix
marriage
laws,
in
the
segregation
cases,
there
were
many
states
for
segregation
laws,
but
that
didn’t
lend
validity
to
those
laws.
with
regard
to
these
regulations,
there
is
a
trend
away
from
it.
if
there
is
any
reference
to
be
drawn
is
the
overwhelming
weight
of
authority
against
these
laws.
just
today,
civil
service
commission’s
bureau
of
policies
and
standards
has
recommended
against
having
such
standards
at
all
in
the
hiring
laws
of
the
employees
of
the
government.
and
as
we
cite
labor
department
and
defense
department
and
other
standards
where
these
are
a
trend
away
in
virginia,
every
county
had
them
at
one
time.
the
richmond
school
board
does
not
now
have
such
a
policy,
although
in
rico
and
the
surrounding
counties
too.
i’d
submit
to
the
court
that
we
can’t,
from
the
widespread
nature
of
the
laws,
draw
any
inference
at
this
time,
the
49%
figure
i
am
sure,
but
i
should
think
will
be
higher
and
all
kinder.
it
does
apply
to
major
school
boards
and
i
have
experience
in
this
case
and
a
companion
case
now
coming
up
through
the
fourth
circuit,
a
class
action
in
virginia
indicates
that
the
fact
that
all
the
counties
in
virginia
have
such
a
regulation.
there
was
a
question
raised
as
to
the
five
months
versus
another
time
and
it’s
conceded
in
this
case
that
there
is
nothing
magical
about
five
months.
it’s
just
they
have
to
draw
a
specific
time
so
they
locked
on
five
months,
but
it
could
be
four
or
sticks
to
seven
in
a
testimony
or
so
in
our
case.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
well,
they
require
as
soon
as
you
know,
but
you
can’t
--
you
must
leave
after
the
fifth
months.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
i
don’t
have
the
precise
date,
i’ll
get
that
your
honor.
as
far
as
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
it
would
your
honor
and
we
don’t
resist
a
notice.
this
was
raised
in
the
prior
case.
we
have
no
question
that
school
board
may
ask
people
who
have
any
kind
of
disability
which
they
know
in
advance.
we
require
them
living
school
at
one
point
to
another
to
notify
the
employer
of
a
pending
–-
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
oh
yes
sir,
yes
sir.
we
have
no
problem
with
that.
that’s
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
there
is
a
separate
issue
which
again
points
out
the
arbitrariness
of
it
on
the
return.
the
regulations
in
this
jurisdiction,
in
this
school
board,
say
that
they
will
return
--
following
their
pregnancy,
they
can
return
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
year
basically.
now,
in
depositions,
it
was
pointed
out
that
they
return
to
a
position
open
at
the
point
at
the
time
they
returned,
if
there
is
a
position
open.
plus
the
regulation
clearly
shows
they
are
not
guaranteed
return
to
the
same
job,
the
same
teaching
position
for
which
they
originally
contracted
and
they
must
file
a
certificate
or
give
the
school
assurance
that
the
trial
will
be
taken
cared
off
okay
and
of
course
this
starts
smacking
the
martin
marietta
case,
because
men
don’t
have
to
give
such
assurances
as
who
is
to
care
for
an
already
born
baby,
which
again,
i
think
points
out
what
they
are
really
concerned
about
is
the
old
fashioned
look
of
women
and
child
raring
and
child
birth,
which
meant
to
the
court
that
the
record
is
abundant
here
not
just,
because
of
watermelons
and
things
like
that.
your
honor,
on
the
notice
dated
at
six
months
prior
to
the
expected
birth,
they
should
get
nervous.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir,
at
the
end
of
the
third
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir,
and
we
have
no
problem
with
when
the
notice
is,
they
may
say
notice
six
months
and
notice
eight
months,
that’s
not
the
problem
we
have
in
this
case.
the
problem
essential
is
just
no
reason
to
make
women
leave
work
when
they
are
perfectly
capable
of
working
other
than
these
old
fashion
notions
of
child
birth.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
the
contracts
have
a
clause,
i
don’t
know,
i
tried
to
find,
i
don’t
have
the
exact
contract
here,
i
am
sorry
your
honor.
but
the
contracts
have
a
clause
referring
to
the
sick
leave
policies.
now,
perhaps
to
the
case
we
would
have
stipulated
in
the
court
below
that
even
if
there
was
a
specific
section
in
the
contract
outlining
this
that
that
wouldn’t
be
bar,
there
have
been
other
teacher
cases
with
these
contract
provisions
where
they
can’t
contract
the
way
your
constitution
rights.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
no.
your
honor
there
is
a
section
on
the
contract
on
the
sick
leave
policies
and
a
section
contract
on
the
school
board
policies
that
they
will
adhere
to
the
school
board
policies.
i
don’t
believe
there
was
section
in
the
contracts
specifically
on
maternity
leave
policies.
now,
they
do
have
in
the
school
board
policies
in
the
teacher’s
handbook.
the
maternity
leave
policies
spelled
out
specifically
as
we
have
it
here
as
it
appears
at
page
i
think
20
and
21
of
our
appendix.
we
submit
to
the
court
in
this
case,
there
was
medical
testimony
that
the
woman
could
teach,
in
this
case
her
own
principal
asked
that
she’d
be
allowed
to
finish
out
the
semester.
in
this
case,
she
would
asked
to
continue
first
--
until
april
1st
which
is
shortly
before
the
expected
date
of
birth
and
later
went
before
the
school
board
and
asked
at
least
could
she
stay
until
mid
january,
january
20th
i
believe
when
the
semester
would
end
so
she
could
finish
the
semester
with
her
students.
they
forced
her
to
leave
on
december
the
18th.
now
apparently
just
before
the
christmas
vacation
although
there’s
nothing
in
the
record
indicate
they
did
it
for
that
reason
alone.
the
facts
still
remains
that
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
the
continuity
argument.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
but
there
still
other
arguments
advised
the
time
of
deposition.
there
is
nothing
to
show
the
absentee
argument
and
give
any
truth
or
validity
to
that.
there
is
nothing
to
show
the
injury
argument.
indeed,
if
you
start
comparing
this
to
other
matters,
for
instances
a
man
with
his
leg
in
a
cast
as
a
result
of
an
skiing
accident
or
what
have
you.
he
certainly
wouldn’t
be
any
great
benefit
in
the
middle
of
a
fire
drill
running
down
the
hall
along
crutches,
but
there
is
no
prescription
against
him.
with
regard
to
the
predictability
of
disabilities
which
was
raised
earlier.
again,
this
is
discrimination
going
after
a
select
class,
which
i
think
just
lands
to
our
position
that
it’s
appearance
they
are
really
concerned
about.
certainly
a
woman,
once
pregnant
is
able
t
predict,
through
medical
testimony
or
medical
doctors
can
predict
the
exact
date
of
birth.
if
so,
can
most
people
for
cosmetic
surgery
and
many
other
things.
now,
there
is
no
regulation
on
cosmetic
surgery.
a
man
or
a
woman
could
make
a
choice
that
we
want
certain
cosmetic
surgery.
and
then
pick
a
date
and
go
to
the
school
board,
take
their
leave
of
absence,
be
out
as
long
as
they
want
in
essence.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
the
medical
evidence
in
this
case
says
basically
there
is
no
disability
during
the
teaching
period.
now,
the
one
thing
that
there
is
there
is
certain
anxiety,
but
there
is
nothing
before
this
court.
and
we
submit
there
could
be
nothing,
which
shows
that
despite
the
anxiety
of
the
condition
of
pregnancy,
it
materially
interferes
with
the
teacher’s
ability
to
teach.
quite
the
contrary,
we
have
amicus
in
this
case
of
the
national
education
association,
as
an
association
of
over
a
million
members
representing
teachers
who
are
not
here
to
blindly
say
they
got
to
work,
no
matter
what
happens.
there
is
in
conscience
i
believe
said
that
education
is
not
hampered
by
teachers
being
in
school
who
are
pregnant
and
i
think
we
could
recognize
the
overwhelming
number
of
members
that
they
have
are
women
teachers.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
no
sir,
and
they
amicus
to
the
other
side,
but
mr.
chief
justice,
we
have
to
i
think
in
this
case
that
the
court
has
in
this
case
decide
is
what
this
representing
to
us
that
this
is
really
a
continuity
argument
and
all
true,
does
it
hold
any
water?
we
submit
it
does
not.
even
if
you
put
aside
the
depositions
and
deal
with
it
as
it’s
before
the
court
right
now
that
--
let’s
look
at
this
point
in
the
constitutional
framework,
if
there
is
any
validity
to
that
statute.
let’s
see
if
we
can
find
a
reasonable
basis.
i
submit
you
cannot.
as
in
the
case
before
us,
our
teacher
was
terminated
when
it
disrupted
continuity.
in
fact,
while
they
have
an
element
in
this
regulation
that
a
teacher
can
be
continued
past
the
fifth
months,
if
the
superintendent
determines
it’s
for
the
good
of
the
school
system,
we
also
have
the
testimony
that
he
had
the
case
that
he
just
doesn’t
continue
anybody
pass
the
fifth
months.
and
this
case
here,
in
a
day
when
there
is
a
wide
market,
lots
of
teachers
readily
available,
where
they
terminate
a
woman
in
december
who
could
have
finished
the
term
and
go
on
right
through.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
we’d
submit
that
should
not
be
your
honor
but
their
argument
is
buttress
by
the
buyers
and
sellers
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir,
in
certain
fields
especially
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
in
fact
in
the
all
fields,
but
your
honor,
it’s
their
argument
that
i’m
trying
to
get
to
that
they
believe
you
have
to
have
the
continuity
because
you
might
not
have
a
teacher
available
later
on.
and
if
you
put
aside,
where
the
teacher
is
available
or
not,
the
whole
continuity
argument
would
fall
on
its
face
if
there
are
plenty
of
teachers
available.
either
way,
there’s
just
no
question
of
this
being
a
discriminatory
statute,
if
not
only
looked
at
as
applying
to
woman
teachers
compared
to
other
teachers,
but
is
applying
to
the
teaching
profession
as
compared
to
the
other
profession.
i
think
an
incident
that
happened
in
the
course
of
this
litigation
is
very
fruitful
here.
when
we
showed
up
to
argue
this
case
in
the
fourth
circuit,
judge
young’s
law
clerk
who
was
the
district
judge
sitting
by
designation
was
in
her
six
month
of
pregnancy
and
anticipated
working
through
eight
month
of
pregnancy.
now,
what
is
so
important
about
teachers
that’s
not
so
important
about
law
clerks
or
if
such
a
time
come
as
we
--
clearly
will
come
when
a
woman
or
more
that
one
woman
rise
to
this
bench,
will
this
court
whoever
determines
such
regulation
say
you
can’t
sit
beyond
your
fifth
month
of
pregnancy.
or
will
you
say
that
judges
on
trial
courts
or
does
anywhere
acquire
that
of
court
clerks
here,
we
believe
they
do
not,
nor
thus
the
government
require
it.
just
because
teachers
in
a
unique
situation
historically
of
the
year
to
your
contract,
there
is
no
reason,
they
should
submit,
to
that
type
of
discrimination
which
is
practiced
nowhere
else,
whether
it
be
in
the
court
system
the
civil
service
system
at
this
time,
or
it’s
just
in
an
anachronism
that
must
be
done
away
with
it.
thank
you.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir.
the
court
has
asked
several
questions
about
the
leave
policies
there
at
page
20
and
21
of
our
appendix.
i
point
out
that
reemployment
is
not
automatic
but
only
comes
after
a
declaration
of
eligibility,
which
includes
a
certificate
from
the
teacher
or
assurance
from
the
teacher
that
she
is
going
to
care
for
her
child
or
can
care
for
a
child
so
that
doesn’t
materially
impair
her
ability
to
function.
as
far
as
this
leeway
that
teachers
have,
we
submit
it’s
not
so
after
the
fifth
month.
at
page
117
of
the
appendix,
we
have
the
testimony
of
the
superintendent
that
no
teachers
on
board
after
the
fifth
month,
it’s
their
very
experience
which
gives
the
light
to
that
belief
that
the
mere
fact
that’s
there
is
that
its
use.
now,
we
disagree
basically
with
the
other
side
on
the
--
what
is
the
issue
of
the
case?
no
question
about
that.
all
of
this
teacher
wants,
all
the
women
want
who
want
this
thing
to
set
aside
is
to
be
treated
equally
with
other
people.
and
they’re
not
treated
equally,
because
they
single
out
this
one
sex
related
disability
in
terms
of
fact
that
when
a
pregnancy
actually
occurs
the
woman
has
to
be
gone.
the
rest
is
just
imagined.
for
instance
mr.
hixon’s
argument
where
she’s
going
to
go
to
the
doctor
13
times,
as
someone
recognized
here
in
the
court,
you
can
go
to
a
doctor
at
other
times,
even
though
the
doctor
testified
he
does
not
have
saturday
hours.
he
is
only
up
nothing
to
4:30,
mrs.
cohen
testified
that’s
when
she
tried
to
get
there
and
we
put
her
record
before
the
court
in
the
district
court,
she
had
missed
two
days
both
related
to
colds
that
she
had
in
the
five
months,
which
is
part
of
those
13
days
in
compass
i
believe,
not
missed
anytime.
but
even
if
she
had,
so
what?
people
miss
time
for
all
sorts
of
things.
could
they
pass
a
rule
against
a
generic
or
a
race
related
disease?
for
instance,
could
they
have
a
rule
of
people
with
sickle
cell
anemia
with
a
tendency
of
the
sickle
cell
anemia
could
no
longer
teach
in
the
school
system
when
we
know
that
that’s
basically
a
race
related
disease,
and
yet
give
people
with
cancer
or
other
diseases
preferential
treatment.
they
could
not,
i
submit
to
the
court,
and
get
away
with
it.
we
have
a
law
in
virginia
which
is
cited
at
page
--
appendix
5,
on
a
dismissal
law
which
is
statewide,
and
where
there’s
a
disability
as
shown
by
competent
medical
evidence,
a
person
can
be
dismissed.
now,
the
state
treats
all
disabilities
equally
and
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
women
should
be
treated
equally.
they
have
no
question
singled
out
one
class
of
persons,
and
i
think
to
argue
whether
it’s
sex
related
is
foolishness.
it
is
clearly
sex
related.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
oh,
no
sir,
no
sir,
for
the
--
the
court
has
raised
this
several
times,
i
think
we
should
be
very
clear,
we
do
not
object
to
the
notice
requirement
and
in
fact
do
not
object
to
a
set
date
requirement,
they
can’t
fix
it
by
law
this
way.
in
other
words,
they
can
have
a
requirement
that
if
a
person
is
going
to
suffer
some
disability,
which
will
force
them
to
leave
teaching
during
the
course
of
the
year,
that
person
must,
as
soon
as
they
know
about
it
or
within
some
specified
date
prior
to
disability
departure
time,
notify
the
employer,
the
school
board
in
this
case,
and
in
fact
even
fix
a
departure
date.
now,
that
will
take
care
of
what
they
say,
we
want
to
plan
ahead
to
replace
the
person.
the
basic
problem
--
there
is
no
problem
with
that.
what
the
problem
is
they
single
out
one
class
of
people.
they
say
“you
must
give
us
a
departure
date
and
no
one
else
must”,
and
that
is
discrimination.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
no
sir,
we
have
no
objection.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
we
think
it
is
unconstitutional,
if
they
confine
it
to
pregnancy.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
well,
that
we
object
to
that
where
it’s
confined
to
pregnancy
also.
if
they
have
it
for
all
people
with
disabilities,
as
the
state
law
has
it,
where
that
disability
is
job
related
and
would
meet
the
due
process
requirements,
and
treated
all
people
the
same,
men
and
women,
female
related
disabilities
and
male
related
disabilities,
it
would
not
file
with
equal
protection.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir,
what
we
submit
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
it
is
not
that.
what
we
submit
violates
it,
is
the
fact
they
limit
it
just
to
women.
they
brought
it
down
to
one
class,
the
compulsory
--
the
notice
requirement
and
the
compulsory
leaving
requirement.
now
taking
the
fifth
month
is
purely
arbitrary,
as
the
court
has
recognized.
they
could
take
the
eight
month
or
the
second
month.
they
just
arbitrarily
and
virtually
flipped
a
coin
to
get
to
the
fifth
month
as
the
testimony
indicates
in
this
case,
but
what
we
object
to
your
honor
is
they
have
singled
out
women
for
treatment
that
men
don’t
receive.
in
this
case
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
cosmetic
surgery
your
honor.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes,
but
it
will
necessitate
you
being
in
the
hospital
and
being
out
of
the
job
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
no
sir,
there
are
some
male
related
diseases
that
judge
winter
points
out
in
dissenting
opinion
of
fourth
circuit,
which
i
am
not
medically
familiar,
but
there
are
questionably
a
number
of
medical
conditions
where
you
have
a
choice
as
to
when
you
will
have
an
operation
and
you
can
go
to
the
school
and
say,
look
i
am
going
to
have
an
operation
either
in
six
weeks
or
two
in
months
or
three
months.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
no
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
that’s
the
argument.
we
debate
that;
we
say
it
is
not
true.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
oh
yes
sir,
i
exceed
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
i
don’t
have
one
your
honor.
my
medical
knowledge
is
that
limited.
on
the
other
hand
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
your
honor
i
say
it’s
not
similar,
i
say
it’s
not
true.
i
said
pregnant
woman
can
teach
as
well
as
any
other
person
in
the
school
system.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
well,
the
doctor
said
we
were
right
in
the
record.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
well,
your
honor
they
say
i
am
wrong,
neither
do
the
doctors
say,
i
am
right,
but
now
we
look
at
the
disabilities.
if
a
man
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
no
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
okay.
i
sometimes
have
difficulty
with
that
your
honor,
but
assuming
there
is
some
difficulty
in
woman
teaching
while
she
is
pregnant,
there
is
equally
difficulty
with
other
people
teaching
with
broken
legs,
even
though
they
won’t
be
gone,
now
you
are
talking
about
the
elements
of
the
teaching
itself.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes,
but
there
is
no
special
regulation
on
them.
teaching
with
bad
backs,
teaching
with
heart
impairments,
teaching
with
other
type
of
impairments.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
yes
sir,
only
insofar
as
they
single
it
out
from
other
matters.
if
they
would
go
by
the
state
law,
and
say
where
a
disability
is
such
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
well,
it
doesn’t
male
related
then,
it
could
be
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
it
could
be
a
(inaudible)
your
honor.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
i
can
only
refer
you
to
judge
winter’s
dissenting
opinion
where
he
does
indicate
some
medical
disabilities
that
men
suffer.
but
again
i
point
your
honor
to
the
fact
that
we
are
making
an
assumption
that
woman
can’t
teach
during
pregnancy,
which
the
record
is
the
opposite
of.
the
record
says
they
can
teach.
doctor
don
who
was
the
head
of
the
medical
college
of
virginia
section
on
gynecology
and
obstetrician
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
insofar
it’s
unsupported
by
the
record,
yes
sir.
now,
we
say
it
is
unsupported
by
record
to
the
contrary
a
very
noted
physician
in
fact
two
of
them
in
virginia.
one
of
them
even
had,
i
think
judge
marage
pointed
out,
delivered
his
own
baby
is
called
dr.
forrest,
but
the
fact
is
the
record
says
just
the
contrary,
the
assumption
you’d
had
me
make
your
honor
that
a
woman
can’t
teach.
and
our
basic
problem
with
this
is
that
they
single
out
women
for
special
treatment
that
(inaudible).
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
they
could
draw
a
line
on
notice
your
honor.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
termination?
well,
according
to
the
medical
testimony
here,
they
couldn’t
draw
the
line.
it
would
be
up
to
the
person
as
in
any
other
situation
to
say
that
they
can
teach
until
such
time.
now,
if
they
had
--
as
they
can
no
longer
adequately
carry
out
their
duties.
if
they
had
a
regulation
that
a
person
who
apparently
couldn’t
carry
out
the
duties,
because
of
an
impending
disability,
which
pregnancy
would
be
one
of
the
obvious
impending
disabilities,
would
have
to
give
notice,
and
then
in
fact
would
have
to
present
a
medical
certificate
or
submit
to
an
examination
of
the
school
doctor,
that
would
be
reasonable
if
it
was
applied
across
the
board.
the
main
problem
her
is
they
picked
out
just
one
thing
to
harp
on
which
is
unconstitutional
your
honor.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
oh
no
sir,
they
have
a
state
law,
they
could
operate
under
that.
if
disability
is
such
that
the
person
can’t
carry
out
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
i
will
accept
that.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
in
some
people
it
is.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
it’s
not
for
me
to
accept
personally
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
i
think
your
honor
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
they
cannot
say
that
a
person
cannot
teach,
because
pregnant,
in
any
way
they
say
a
person
can’t
teach
because
they
got
a
cold.
now,
cold
can
result
to
pneumonia.
the
statistics
in
this
case
are
lot
more
hours
lost
from
teaching
for
colds
than
during
pregnancy,
statistics
that
we
have
from
the
labor
department.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
not
a
surgical
type
leave
which
required
an
operation
but
of
course
--
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
well
of
course
the
statistics
that
absenteeism
itself
from
the
labor
department
had
pregnancy
is
one
of
the
lower
causes,
but
it
didn’t
include
the
actual
period
the
woman
was
going
for
the
birth
itself.
it
included
the
period
that
was
still
employed
during
which
they
would
miss
for
a
doctors
appointments
or,
get
the
questions
asked
this
side,
the
job
related,
during
job
related
times,
they
are
missing
because
of
illness
as
something
during
the
pregnancy.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
not
for
operable
disabilities
your
honor.
i
would
not
personally
have
that
knowledge.
i
am
not
that
familiar
with
the
record,
although
i
did
read
it,
but
not
for
operable
disabilities.
but
in
terms
of
overall
disabilities,
in
other
words
time
missed
on
job
itself,
there
are
far
greater
causes.
mr.
philip
j.
hirschkop
we
have
that
statistic
in
the
record
your
honor
from
the
department
of
labor.
thank
you
your
honor.
