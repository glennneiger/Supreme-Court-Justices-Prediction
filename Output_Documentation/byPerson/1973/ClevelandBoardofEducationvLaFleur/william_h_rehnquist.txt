justice
william

well,

mr.

isn’t
one
the
at
least
contentions
here
that
in
addition
to
being
gone
during
the
pregnancy
that
the
teacher
herself
loses
some
of
her
ability
to
teach?
now,
you
say
it’s
not
material
but
that
isn’t
exactly
similar
than
to
cosmetic
surgery
where
presumably
up
until
the
night
before
the
operation,
the
person
hasn’t
lost
any
of
their
customary
ability.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
with
a
broken
leg
you
don’t
have
the
anticipated
disability
long
in
advance.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
is
arguing
that
pregnancy
combines
possible
disability
during
the
term
plus
an
anticipated
death
and
a
disability
at
a
given
time.
and
i
think
justice
stewart
and
justice
white
have
both
asked
if
you
claim
this
as
sex
discriminatory,
give
us
an
example
of
something
else
the
state
should
have
included
in
this
that
represents
all
those
things
and
that
they
didn’t
and
i
have
yet
to
hear
your
answer
to
that.
