justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
school
board’s
rule,
after
pregnancy,
does
the
teacher
have
any
preference
for
rehiring
over
any
other
applicant
for
any
existing
vacancy?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
you
mean
when
--
at
the
beginning
of
the
next
school
year
after
she’s
declared
eligible
for
reemployment.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
she
doesn’t
but
she’s
only
guaranteed
reemployment
as
of
the
date
of
beginning
of
the
next
term?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
year,
school
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
she
doesn’t
approve
that
seniority
once
she
is
on
leave
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
why
do
you
want
to
--
why
do
you
want
to
plan
for
continuity
at
a
certain
predict
--
why
don’t
you
wait
until
two
weeks
before
pregnancy?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
you
could
point
out
--
you
could
have
continuity
whenever,
whatever
the
definite
cut
off
date
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
why
do
you
pick
five
months
or
four
months?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you’re
now
--
you’re
dealing
with
a
teacher
who
doesn’t
look
at
it
that
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
wouldn’t
be
any
disruption
if
you
planned
to
have
a
substitute
teacher
come
in
and
take
over
a
month
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
alright
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
doesn’t
guarantee
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
maybe
it
guarantees
it
for
five
month
rather
than
for
four.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
other
way
it
would
again
--
might
guarantee
it
for
eight
months.
justice
byron
r.
white
give
me
example
of
another
condition
that
would
predictably
resolve
in
leaving
the
job
then
about
which
you
could
give
some
notice.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn’t
the
condition;
that’s
just
a
choice
that
you
are
going
to
--
sometime
you
are
going
to
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
you
might
do
--
you
mean
if
you
plan
to
be
away
during
the
school
year,
you
give
notice.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
other
thing
about
it
is
that
there
is
--
i
guess
part
of
the
argument
is
when
the
woman
is
pregnant,
the
point
of
having
or
getting
out
to
leave
on
at
five
months
or
four
months,
is
it
during
the
pregnancy
she
is
more
likely
to
be
away
from
work?
that’s
the
part
of
the
argument.
now,
that
isn’t
true
of
cosmetic
surgery.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
that’s
the
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
give
me
another
--
give
me
a
male
related
condition
that’s
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
assume
you
are
wrong
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
assume
you’re
wrong,
that
state
says
you’re
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
are
wrong,
i
take
it,
do
you
think
your
case
in
trouble?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
why
don’t
you
assume
that
you
are
wrong
for
a
moment
and
then
tell
me
what
then?[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
assuming
that
--
assume
as
you,
just
like
doing
of
course,
but
assume
that
pregnancy
does
impair
teaching
ability.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
you
say
still
is
disentitled
constitutionally
to
provide
for
compulsory
leave.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
just
told
me,
you
couldn’t
find
--
you
couldn’t
think
of
any
other
male
related
disease
that
had
that
--
the
cosmetic
surgery,
that
doesn’t
involve
any
impairment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
or
yes
i
--
justice
byron
r.
white
give
me
an
example.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
want
us
to
--
if
there
were
contrary
judicial
finding
below,
you
would
like
us
to
differ
with
that
and
overrule
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you’ve
also,
it
seems
to
me,
taken
a
position
that
would
preclude
the
school
board
from
saying
that
pregnancy,
while
a
pregnancy
goes
on
up
until
the
time
of
childbirth,
is,
in
any
way,
debilitating?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
you
won’t
accept
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
won’t
accept
that,
i
mean
you
would
accept
it
if
pregnancy
as
some
women
experience
it,
that
is
really,
physically
debilitating.
but
you
say
the
woman
can
go
as
just
as
good
a
teacher
while
she
is
pregnant
as
any
other
time.
you
will
not
accept
the
fact
that
she
is
--
that
the
pregnancy
is
a
debilitating
condition.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
of
course
it
is
in
some
people,
but
you
wouldn’t
accept
a
general
regulation
describing
it
as
a
debilitating
situation.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
will
accept
that,
then
we
have
a
different
--
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly,
a
difference
where
the
state
is
considerably
narrow.
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the

the
