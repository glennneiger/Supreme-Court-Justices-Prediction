mr.
robert
f.
hanley
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--
to
what
extent
are
you
pursuing
the
suggestion
of
the
federal
district
court
in
illinois
did
not
have
jurisdiction
of
this?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
hanley?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
see
if
i
follow
you
on
this.
i
take
it
it’s
your
position
of
course
that
the
parties
should
go
to
arbitration.
do
you
concede
that
once
the
arbitral
award
has
arrived
at,
that
nevertheless
the
federal
district
court
may
then
pass
upon
the
issue
of
whether
our
public
policy
prevents
its
enforcement?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
that
convention
preserves
consistently
the
issue
of
whether
the
arbitration
award
is
against
public
policy
in
this
country
or
any
country,
does
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
i
get
back
to
my
question
do
you
--
whether,
if
you
prevail
on
the
primary
availability
of
arbitration
here
under
the
agreement,
you
still
aren’t
subject
possibly
to
an
american
court's
passing
on
the
public
policy
issue?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
may
will
be
and
--
but
certainly
the
arbitrator
is
not
the
one
to
pass
on
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
guess,
that’s
what
i
am
asking.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
aksen
let
me
be
straight.
did
you
say
public
policy
was
not
a
factor
in
the
un
convention?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
that
doesn’t
invalidate
the
validity
of
my
inquiry
to
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.

f.
