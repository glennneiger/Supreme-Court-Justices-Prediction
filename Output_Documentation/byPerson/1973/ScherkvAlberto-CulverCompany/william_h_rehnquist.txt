justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
aksen,
is
there
some
workable
line
that
could
be
drawn
assuming
that
the
court
wish
to
follow
your
suggestion
between
the
wilko
versus
swan
type
of
case
and
this
type
of
case?
it
seems
to
me
it
is
not
entirely
satisfactory
to
say
this
was
a
wealthy
man
and
he
had
three
lawyers
and
the
guy
wilko
against
swan
did
not
have
any
lawyer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
higgins?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
your
client
engages
in
considerable
negotiation
over
where
there
shall
be
arbitrator
that’s
really
a
throw
away
from
his
point
of
view.
i
suppose
since
it
can
never
be
enforced,
he
can
get
some
other
concession
for
that
and
still
renege
if
it
comes
off?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
except
wilko,
i
understand
was
a
kind
of
a
contract
of
adhesion
where
there
wasn’t
a
very
substantial
bargaining
process?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
your
view
of
the
law,
would
the
arbitration
provision
and
the
agreement
that
your
client
signed
be
applicable
to
some
disputes
that
arose
under
the
act?
