it’s
your
admission
i
guess
that
that
language
means
that
if
an

comes
to
a
court
it’s
the
federal
district
courts
that
have
exclusive

is
that
your
point?
justice

stewart
that
language
is
not
on

is
it?
justice

stewart
and
it
was

is

it

yes,
but
that
case
didn’t
involve
this
question

justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
the
only
question
here.
if
you
look
at
the
petition
for

that
it’s
considered
rightly
or
wrongly
that
at

arguendo
this
is
a
security
and
that
there
has
been
an
alleged
violation
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of

there
is
only
one
question
presented
in
petition
for
certiorari.
leasco
didn't

it
simply
involved
the
applicability
of
the

justice

stewart
the
second
opinion
and
judgment,
that
i
am
authorized
to
announce
this
morning
is
the
number
73-781,
fritz
scherk
petitioner
versus
alberto-culver
co.,
a
case
which
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
alberto-culver
co.,
the
respondent
is
an
american
company
incorporated
in
delaware
with
its
principal
office
in
illinois.
it
manufactures
and
distributes
cosmetics
in
this
country
and
abroad.
during
the
1960's
alberto-culver
decided
to
expand
its
overseas
operations,
and
as
part
of
this
program
it
approached
the
petitioner
fritz
scherk,
a
german
citizen
residing
in
switzerland.
scherk
was
the
owner
of
three
interrelated
business
entities,
organized
under
the
laws
of
germany
and
liechtenstein.
those
business
organizations
were
engaged
in
the
manufacture
of
cosmetics
and
in
the
licensing
of
trademarks
for
cosmetics.
an
initial
contact
with
scherk
was
made
by
a
representative
of
alberto-culver
in
germany
in
june
1967,
and
the
negotiations
followed
at
further
meetings
in
both
europe
and
the
united
states
during
1967
and
1968.
in
february
1969
a
contract
was
signed
in
vienna,
austria,
which
provided
for
the
transfer
of
the
ownership
of
scherk's
enterprises
to
alberto-culver,
along
with
all
rights
held
by
these
enterprises
to
trademarks
in
cosmetic
goods.
the
contract
contained
a
number
of
express
warranties
whereby
scherk
guaranteed
the
sole
and
unencumbered
ownership
of
the
trademarks.
in
addition,
the
contract
contained
an
arbitration
clause
providing
that
any
controversy
or
claim
that
shall
arise
out
of
this
agreement
or
the
breach
thereof,
would
be
referred
to
arbitration
before
the
international
chamber
of
commerce
in
paris,
france.
the
closing
of
the
transaction
took
place
in
geneva,
switzerland,
in
june
1969.
nearly
one
year
later
alberto-culver
allegedly
discovered
that
the
trademark
rights
purchased
under
the
contract
were
subject
to
substantial
encumbrances
that
threatened
to
give
others
superior
rights
to
the
trademarks
and
to
restrict
or
preclude
alberto-culver's
use
of
them.
alberto-culver
commenced
this
action
for
damages
and
other
relief
in
a
federal
district
court
in
illinois,
contending
that
scherk's
fraudulent
representations
concerning
the
status
of
the
trademark
rights
constituted
violations
of
section
10
(b)
of
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934,
and
the
rule
10
(b)
(5)
promulgated
under
that
section.
in
response,
scherk
filed
a
motion
to
stay
the
action
pending
arbitration
in
paris,
pursuant
to
the
agreement
of
the
parties.
alberto-culver
in
turn,
sought
a
preliminary
injunction
restraining
the
prosecution
of
arbitration
proceedings.
the
district
court
granted
a
preliminary
order
enjoining
scherk
from
proceeding
with
arbitration.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed
by
a
divided
court,
upon
what
it
considered
the
controlling
authority
of
this
court's
decision
in
the
case
of
wilko
versus
swan,
a
case
that's
reported
in
volume
346
of
the
united
states
reports.
because
of
the
importance
of
the
question
presented
we
granted
scherk's
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
the
congress
enacted
the
arbitration
act
of
1925,
to
allow
parties
to
avoid
the
costliness
and
delays
of
litigation
and
to
place
arbitration
agreements
upon
the
same
footing
as
other
contracts.
accordingly,
the
act
provides
that
an
arbitration
agreement
such
as
is
here
involved
shall
be
valid,
irrevocable,
and
enforceable,
save
upon
such
grounds
as
exist
at
law
or
in
equity
for
the
revocation
of
any
contract.
the
act
also
provides
for
a
stay
of
proceedings
in
a
case
where
a
court
is
satisfied
that
the
issue
before
it
is
arbitrable
under
the
agreement,
and
another
section
of
the
act
directs
a
federal
court
to
order
parties
to
proceed
to
arbitration
if
there
has
been
a
failure,
neglect
or
refusal
of
any
party
to
honor
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
the
arbitration
act
of
1925
was
amended
in
1970
so
as
to
make
even
clear
its
coverage
of
international
private
arbitration
agreements.
alberto-culver's
contract
to
purchase
the
business
entities
belonging
to
scherk
was
clearly
a
truly
international
agreement.
such
an
agreement
involves
considerations
and
policies
significantly
different
from
those
the
court
found
controlling
in
the
case
of
wilko
against
swan.
in
that
case,
there
was
no
question,
but
that
the
laws
of
the
united
states
generally
and
the
federal
securities
laws
in
particular,
would
govern
disputes
arising
out
of
the
stock-purchase
agreement,
there
involved.
the
parties,
the
negotiations,
and
the
subject
matter
of
the
contract
were
all
situated
in
this
country,
and
no
credible
claim
could
have
possibly
been
entertained
that
any
international
conflict-of-laws
problems
could
arise.
in
the
present
case,
by
contrast,
in
the
absence
of
the
arbitration
provision
considerable
uncertainty
existed
at
the
time
of
the
agreement,
and
still
exists,
concerning
the
law
applicable
to
the
resolution
of
disputes
arising
out
of
the
contract.
such
uncertainty
will
almost
inevitably
exists
with
respect
to
any
contract
touching
two
or
more
countries,
each
with
its
own
substantive
laws
and
conflict-of-law
rule.
a
contractual
provision
specifying
in
advance
the
forum
in
which
disputes
shall
be
litigated
and
the
law
to
be
applied
is,
therefore,
an
almost
indispensable
precondition
to
achievement
of
the
orderliness
and
predictability
essential
to
any
international
business
transaction
or
indeed
any
business
transaction.
a
parochial
refusal
by
the
courts
of
one
country
to
enforce
an
international
arbitration
agreement
would
not
only
frustrate
these
purposes,
but
would
invite
unseemly
and
mutually
destructive
jockeying
by
the
parties
to
secure
tactical
litigation
advantages.
in
the
present
case,
for
example,
it
is
not
inconceivable
that
if
scherk
had
anticipated
that
alberto-culver
would
be
able
in
this
country
to
enjoin,
resort
to
arbitration
he
might
have
sought
an
order
in
france
or
some
other
country
enjoining
alberto-culver
from
proceeding
with
its
litigation
in
the
united
states.
whatever
recognition
the
courts
of
this
country
might
ultimately
have
granted
to
the
order
of
the
foreign
court,
the
dicey
atmosphere
of
such
a
legal
no-man's-land
would
surely
damage
the
fabric
of
international
commerce
and
trade,
and
imperil
the
willingness
and
ability
of
businessmen
to
enter
international
commercial
agreements.
for
these
reasons
which
are
elaborated
in
the
court's
written
opinion,
we
hold
that
the
agreement
of
the
parties
in
this
case
to
arbitrate
any
dispute
arising
out
of
their
international
commercial
transaction
is
to
be
respected
and
enforced
by
the
federal
courts
in
accord
with
the
explicit
provisions
of
the
arbitration
act.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
to
that
court
with
directions
to
remand
ti
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
written
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
to
which
mr.
