mr.
robert
f.
hanley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
fritz
scherk
and
this
case
involves
the
acquisition
of
petitioner’s
three
related
european
cosmetic
businesses
by
respondent
alberto-culver,
an
american
corporation.
the
issue
that’s
presented
is
the
enforceability
of
arbitration
clauses
entered
into
as
part
of
international
agreements
in
the
face
of
charges
of
violations
of
the
securities
exchange
act
section
10
(b)
and
rule
10b-5.
the
facts
as
reflected
in
the
complaint
and
in
the
un-contradicted
portions
of
the
affidavits
which
were
filed
in
the
trial
court
and
the
district
court
are
as
follows.
alberto-culver
became
interested
in
petitioner’s
businesses
back
in
june
or
july
of
1967
and
apparently
became
interested
because
they
were
having
some
problems
getting
their
products,
their
hair
products
and
so
forth
into
the
german
market,
accepted
on
the
german
market
and
scherk
apparently
had
a
good
name,
established
name
in
that
market.
so
in
june
or
july
steps
were
taken,
contacts
were
made
in
berlin,
in
west
berlin
by
alberto-culver.
your
honors,
there’s
some
disagreement
between
the
parties
as
to
whether
a
meeting
which
was
held
in
melrose
park,
illinois
in
may
of
1968
or
meeting
in
west
berlin
in
march
of
1968
was
the
most
significant
with
respect
to
putting
this
transaction
together.
but
there
is
no
contradiction
about
the
fact
that
these
negotiations
commenced
in
europe.
they
were
then
negotiated
and
conducted
in
both
europe
and
the
united
states
for
a
period
of
two
years
and
they
--
and
finally
came
to
conclusion
at
a
closing
in
geneva,
switzerland
in
june
of
1969.
now,
a
battery
of
attorneys
took
months
to
put
together
these
acquisition
agreements
which
are
spread
over
some
100
and
125
pages.
and
they
contained
clear
clauses
by
which
the
parties
agreed
to
negotiate,
to
arbitrate
all
future
disputes
before
the
international
chamber
of
commerce
in
paris,
france.
the
parties
used
both
american
and
german
attorneys
in
investigating
and
in
negotiating
and
putting
together
this
sale
of
these
three
foreign
businesses.
they
also
used
trademark
experts,
business
consultants,
and
alberto-culver
used
its
outside
auditors
peat,
marwick,
mitchell
&
company.
part
of
the
purchase
price
for
the
companies
was
paid
in
the
form
of
promissory,
four
promissory
notes
which
were
delivered
to
the
petitioner
mr.
scherk
at
the
time
of
the
closing
in
geneva.
now,
in
1970
alberto-culver
concluded
that
petitioner
mr.
scherk
had
breached
trademark
warranties,
having
to
do
with
trademarks
that
had
been
owned
by
the
scherk
enterprises.
and
he
charged
--
they
charged
a
violation
--
they
brought
suit
notwithstanding
the
arbitration
clause,
brought
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
charging
in
june
of
1971,
charging
violations
of
section
10
(b),
rule
10b-5
charged
common
law,
deceit,
fraud,
and
charged
a
breach
of
warranty
--
breach
of
trademark
warranty.
and
mr.
scherk
had
taken
steps
to
arbitrate
the
controversy
in
paris
back
in
january
of
1971.
but
he
had
not
filed
the
necessary
papers
take
on
to
formal
steps.
those
steps
were
not
taken
until
after
the
suit
in
this
case
was
filed.
those
steps
were
taken.
arbitration
was
commenced
officially
or
formally
in
november
of
1971.
we
filed
motions
to
dismiss
the
complaint
based
upon
contentions
that
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction
over
the
person
of
the
petitioner.
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
and
on
the
basis
of
forum
non
conveniens.
in
the
alternative,
we
also
applied
for
a
stay
pending
arbitration,
stay
of
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court.
our
motions
were
all
denied
and
the
district
court
granted
an
injunction
enjoining
the
petitioner
mr.
scherk
from
proceeding
with
arbitration
in
paris.
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed,
analyzing
and
applying
the
court’s
1953
decision
in
wilko
versus
swan
as
invalidating
arbitration
clauses
and
of
course
on
the
wilko
against
swan,
the
invalidation
was
with
respect
to
charges
--
was
in
the
face
of
charges
under
the
securities
act
of
1933.
here,
we
are
talking
about
the
--
and
here
is
the
seventh
circuit
applied
wilko
v.
swan
in
the
phase
of
charges
of
violations,
the
exchange
act
in
10b-5.
our
position
--
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
federal
district
court
has
now
ruled
and
in
the
face
of
our
motion
to
dismiss
on
jurisdictional
grounds
we
believe
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
--
if
you
are
asking
me
as
far
as
the
preliminary
injunction
is
concerned,
the
court
of
appeals
has
ruled
that
it
had
jurisdiction
under
1292
(a)
(1).
we
certainly
agree
with
that
contention.
this
was
the
granting
of
an
injunction,
a
preliminary
injunction.
we
have,
as
far
as
our
motion
to
dismiss
was
not
certified
here
and
that
issue
i
believe
is
just
not
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
is
a
security
of
whether
or
not
mr.
scherk
was
properly
before
the
court,
i
don’t
think
is
any
longer
subject
to
debate
in
these
proceedings.
we
have
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
parties
--
over
the
subject
matter
and
that
this
appeal
was
properly
before
this
court
as
a
preliminary
injunction
under
1292.
our
position
here
is
that
this
court
upon
a
re-analysis
of
wilko
versus
swan
in
the
light
of
the
international
context
here
and
a
strong
federal
policy
favoring
arbitration
need
not
and
should
not
apply
wilko
versus
swan
mechanically
--
mechanistically
and
invalidate
arbitration
agreements
where
security
violations
are
alleged
in
this
international
context.
there
is
no
compelling
reason
to
extend
wilko
versus
swan.
and
some
very
great
good
reasons
we
assert
of
why
wilko
should
not
be
applied
in
these
circumstances.
circuit
judge
stevens
said
in
his
dissenting
opinion
below,
“the
enforcement
of
these
arbitration
agreements
in
this
case
would
not
frustrate
the
policies
of
the
exchange
act
whereas
refusal
to
enforce
them
would
certainly
frustrate
important
policies
which
this
court
is
articulated
as
recently
as
1972
in
the
zapata
case.”
it’s
clear,
i
believe,
it’s
absolutely
clear
that
without
wilko
versus
swan,
the
arbitration
provisions
in
these
–
in
this
acquisition
–
on
these
acquisition
agreements
would
be
enforced.
they
be
enforced
under
either
chapter
one
or
chapter
2
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
we
look
in
vain
and
have
read
the
briefs
in
vain
for
any
reason
to
support
the
mechanical
application
of
wilko
versus
swan
to
the
situation
here.
the
respondent
is
not
going
to
lose
his
right
to
be
heard
on
these
trademark
--
these
breaches
of
trademark,
the
arbitration,
the
arbitral
courts
have
and
can
arbitrate
matters
going
to
allegations
of
fraud
and
breaches
of
warranty.
the
respondent
says
in
effect,
“i
agree
to
arbitrate.
now,
i
do
not
want
to
arbitrate
anymore.
and
i
look
around
and
i
found
this
supreme
court
cases.
1953
cases
says
i
don’t
have
to
and
it
gives
me
an
excuse
so
i
am
not
going
to
live
up
to
my
bargain.”
and
the
respondent
points
to
the
language
of
section
27
of
the
exchange
act
which
says
that
district
courts
shall
have
explosive
jurisdiction
of
violations
to
the
title
or
the
rules
and
regulations
there
under
and
that
all
suits
an
equity
in
actions
in
law
to
enforce
any
liability
or
duly
created
under
the
title
and
so
forth
will
be
in
the
district
court.
now,
he
points
to
that
–
the
respondent
points
the
language
and
says
that,
“as
i
understand
his
argument
that
all
securities
disputes
must
be
resolved
in
the
united
states
district
courts.”
that
does
not
comport
with
reality.
the
securities
exchange
commission
is
resolving
securities
disputes
everyday
in
arbitration
proceedings
where
the
matters
are
involved,
existing
disputes
are
being
arbitrated
everyday.
we
are
having
resolution
of
securities
problems
and
arbitration
proceedings
between
members
of
exchanges
where
they
have
rules
requiring
arbitration.
we
are
having
arbitration
in
securities
matters
and
proceedings
between
non-members
and
members
of
exchanges.
and
we’re
having
arbitration
proceedings
where
the
broker
opposes
arbitration
and
the
customer
fixes
it,
and
it
just
doesn’t
follow.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
technically,
your
honor,
i
believe
we
would
have
to
concede
under
the
cases
that
for
the
purpose,
at
least
to
this
argument,
we
concede
that
there
are
promissory
notes
involved.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
no,
well.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
there
was
a
purchase
of
assets.
there
was
a
purchase
of
a
going
business
concern.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
there
were
some
--
your
honor
that’s
90%
accurate.
there
were
some
trademark
rights
and
some
rights
in
israel
and
in
other
parts
of
the
world
that
were
reserved
by
mr.
scherk,
but
basically
they
acquired,
the
respondent
required
his
business
enterprise.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
he
acquired
stock
in
a
company
or
business
--
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
it
was
liechtenstein
anstalt,
your
honor,
and
at
the
time
of
the
transaction,
at
the
time
of
the
re-entering
into
it,
it
was
not
a
stock
company.
it
was
specifically
not
a
stock
company.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
it
was
converted
as
part
of
the
transaction
and
stock
was
issued
and
was
delivered
and
at
the
time
of
the
closing
it
was
held
in
escrow.
i
think
the
point
on
this
is
that
if
we
permit
these
four
promissory
notes
and
this
transformed
german
--
liechtenstein
anstalt
to
establish
the
rule
for
the
court
and
automatically
--
the
court
would
automatically
apply
wilko
versus
swan
in
that
situation
with
those
connecting
factors.
it’s
our
position
that
you
are
certainly
permitting
form
to
rule
substance
and
that
there
is
no
reason
--
there
is
no
countervailing,
in
these
–
in
this
circumstance,
there
is
no
countervailing
policy
with
respect
to
the
enforcement
of
the
securities
laws
in
this
situation
that
would
justify
that.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
your
honor
i
have
read
the
cases
and
have
seen
the
extension
of
this
definition
of
securities
to
include
and
i
do
not
like
to
state
and
argue
by
myself
but
i
--
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
no,
your
honor.
not
to
my
satisfaction
but
nevertheless
i
think
that
the
--
our
point
here
is
that
if
really
is
not,
it’s
not
necessary
for
us
to
fight
any
longer
on
that
point
because
there
is
just
really
no
requirement
here
to
apply
wilko
versus
swan
if
we
--
arguendo
if
we
are
within
the
securities
exchange
ambit
in
this
case
and
we
argue
that
and
we
lost
that
in
the
district
court
and
we
have
considered
for
the
sake
of
this
argument.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
well
--
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
alright,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
that’s
right,
your
honor.
that’s
right.
we
say
--
mr.
chief
justice
we
say
that
wilko
just
doesn’t
fit
here.
it
was
a
garden
variety
domestic
case
involving
a
customer
of
a
brokerage
house
who
would
sign
the
17-page
form
agreement
provided
by
the
brokerage
house,
contained
an
arbitration
clause
along
with
other
provisions
which
waived
the
protection
of
federal
securities
law.
there
was
a
great
disparity
in
bargaining
positions,
great
disparity
in
the
relative
degrees
of
sophistication,
just
a
very
clear
disparity
in
bargaining
power.
there
was
no
compelling
reason
not
to
relieve
the
customer
of
his
agreement
to
arbitrate
under
circumstances
and
some
fairly
compelling
reasons
to
show
that
it
would
have
been
unfair
to
require
him
to
arbitrate
under
the
circumstances.
our
situation
is
entirely
different.
alberto-culver
went
to
europe.
they
purchased
these
short
businesses.
they
used
an
array
of
european-american
lawyers,
trademark
experts,
business
consultants.
the
sophisticated
businessman
here
agreed
to
arbitrate
their
disputes.
after
a
two-year,
arm’s
length
transaction,
there
was
no
over-winning
bargaining
power
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner.
it’s
clear
also
that
alberto-culver
considered
the
possibility
that
they’re
going
to
have
trademark
problems.
mr.
silver,
their
general
counsel’s
affidavit
here
shows
--
evidences
great
concern
about
trademarks
as
shown
also
by
the
fact
that
the
trademark
warranties
took
up
some
25
pages
in
the
acquisition
agreement.
they
clearly
anticipated
trademark
as
area
of
possible
future
dispute.
and
to
permit
the
respondent
to
refuse
to
honor
its
promise
to
arbitrate
in
an
agreed
forum
where
the
agreement
was
reached
in
good
faith
after
free
and
fair
bargaining
between
the
parties
with
equal
bargaining
power
just
plain
isn’t
fair.
wilko
should
be
extended
to
permit
an
american
businessman,
that
dishonored
his
agreement
with
a
foreigner
and
certainly
the
foreign
aspects
that
are
compelling
enough.
the
international
aspects
to
this
case
are
compelling
enough
not
to
extend
the
wilko
rule
in
this
case.
we
know
that
uncertainty
--
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
arbitral
court
should
resolve
all
of
the
questions,
all
of
the
factual
questions
here.
yes,
we
do.
we
don’t
think
we
are
in
a
situation
where
it’s
necessary
to
remand
the
case
here
to
make
a
determination
whether
there
are
these
policy
matters
present
in
this
case.
the
--
it’s
very
clear
--
that
it's
very
clear
here
that
there
is
no,
at
least,
it’s
clear
to
me
that
there
is
no
countervailing
policy
present.
there
is
no
shown
and
the
matter
has
been
argued,
there
is
no
showing
here
that
under
the
facts
in
this
case
with
arbitration
that
there
would
be
a
concomitant
detriment
to
security
law
enforcement.
so,
i
would
say
that
this
matter
should
be
resolved
by
the
court,
by
the
arbitral
court
in
paris
in
accordance
with
the
solemn
agreement
of
the
parties.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
your
honor,
i
can
see
areas
that
--
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
your
honor,
we
can
certainly
hypothecate
factual
situations
in
which
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
not
to
apply
wilko
versus
swan
in
this
particular
case.
assume
a
british
company
coming
over
and
making
a
tender
offer
on
a
widely
held
corporation
and
that
kind
of
a
situation.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
well,
what
we’ve
tried
to
show
your
honor
is
that
under
section
27,
the
courts
have
not
been
requiring
that
all
securities
disputes
be
resolved
in
the
district
courts.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
well,
we
hope
we’ve
shown
your
honor
that
it
would
be
--
that
because
of
the
policies
that
were
established
by
this
court
or
articulated
in
this
court
in
zapata
that
it
would
be
unfair
and
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
extend
zapata
into
this
international
situation.
i
am
sorry,
i
mean
in
wilko
versus
swan.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
and
we
believe
that
as
in
zapata,
your
honor
that
the
issues
in
this
case
are
ripe
for
determination
by
the
arbitral
court.
the
thing
we
didn’t
and
have
a
chance,
we
really
haven’t
mention
was
the
uncertainty
in
this
international
transactions
which
are
the
real
bugaboo
of
these
international
transactions
and
it’s
essential
for
the
foreign
businessmen
to
know
in
advance
where
and
how
they’re
going
to
resolve
their
conflicts.
the
parties
bring
to
the
bargaining
table
different
legal
theories
and
they
pay
for,
they
arbitrate
and
they
negotiate
and
they
pay
for
these
arbitration
clauses.
in
fact,
they
may
be
the
sine
qua
non
of
an
international
transaction.
in
the
wilko
garden
variety,
securities
matter
where
you’re
are
buying
securities
from
a
broker.
there
is
no
compelling
reason
that
the
parties
have
such
certainly,
but
they
certainly
need
that
certainty
in
international
transaction.
and
one
of
the
things
that’s
happened
of
course
since
wilko
is
that
we
have
articulated
a
strong
national
policy
in
favor
of
arbitration
of
international
transactions
both
in
chapter
2
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
also
in
the
accession
in
the
united
nations
treaty
for
the
enforcement
of
arbitral
awards
and
we
think
--
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
if
there
are
facts
i
would
certainly
agree,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
would
certainly
agree
if
there
are
facts
to
be
resolved
that
they
may
have
to
be
resolved
as
the
court
indicated
in
zapata.
i
don’t
see
them.
frankly,
i
don’t
see
any
facts
for
resolution
with
respect
to
public
policy
in
the
matter
–
in
the
case
that's
before
your
honors.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
i
would
concede
it.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
i
think
not.
it
was
a
garden
variety,
customer
of
a
brokerage
house,
hayden
stone.
hayden
stone
sends
almost
17-page
form
contract,
adhesion
contract,
signs
an
arbitration
clause,
tremendous
disparity
and
bargaining
of
power,
tremendous
disparity
and
relative
bargaining
strengths,
business
acumen,
sophistication.
it’s
just
exactly
the
antithesis
of
your
situation
with
their
battery
of
lawyers
and
experts
who
looked
at
this
as
a
sophisticated
businessmen
and
got
together
after
two
years
and
agreed
that
we
are
going
to
arbitrate
the
very
kinds
of
disputes
that
have
arisen
here
in
paris
and
what
a
shocking
surprise
that
must
be
to
wake
up
and
find
that
your
--
you
negotiate,
your
going
to
be
required
to
resolve
your
conflicts
in
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
well,
i
understood
--
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
well,
it
may
--
it
may
be
a
security
your
honor
and
in
this
particular
situation
assuming
as
a
security
we
are
saying
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
this
court
to
effectuate
the
rule,
to
apply
the
rule,
to
extend
the
rule
in
wilko
versus
swan
and
to
prevent
arbitration
here.
the
amicus
[voice
overlap]
five
minutes
in
this
--
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioner
fritz
scherk
and
this
case
involves
the
acquisition
of
petitioner’s
three
related
european
cosmetic
businesses
by
respondent
alberto-culver,
an
american
corporation.
the
issue
that’s
presented
is
the
enforceability
of
arbitration
clauses
entered
into
as
part
of
international
agreements
in
the
face
of
charges
of
violations
of
the
securities
exchange
act
section
10
(b)
and
rule
10b-5.
the
facts
as
reflected
in
the
complaint
and
in
the
un-contradicted
portions
of
the
affidavits
which
were
filed
in
the
trial
court
and
the
district
court
are
as
follows.
alberto-culver
became
interested
in
petitioner’s
businesses
back
in
june
or
july
of
1967
and
apparently
became
interested
because
they
were
having
some
problems
getting
their
products,
their
hair
products
and
so
forth
into
the
german
market,
accepted
on
the
german
market
and
scherk
apparently
had
a
good
name,
established
name
in
that
market.
so
in
june
or
july
steps
were
taken,
contacts
were
made
in
berlin,
in
west
berlin
by
alberto-culver.
your
honors,
there’s
some
disagreement
between
the
parties
as
to
whether
a
meeting
which
was
held
in
melrose
park,
illinois
in
may
of
1968
or
meeting
in
west
berlin
in
march
of
1968
was
the
most
significant
with
respect
to
putting
this
transaction
together.
but
there
is
no
contradiction
about
the
fact
that
these
negotiations
commenced
in
europe.
they
were
then
negotiated
and
conducted
in
both
europe
and
the
united
states
for
a
period
of
two
years
and
they
--
and
finally
came
to
conclusion
at
a
closing
in
geneva,
switzerland
in
june
of
1969.
now,
a
battery
of
attorneys
took
months
to
put
together
these
acquisition
agreements
which
are
spread
over
some
100
and
125
pages.
and
they
contained
clear
clauses
by
which
the
parties
agreed
to
negotiate,
to
arbitrate
all
future
disputes
before
the
international
chamber
of
commerce
in
paris,
france.
the
parties
used
both
american
and
german
attorneys
in
investigating
and
in
negotiating
and
putting
together
this
sale
of
these
three
foreign
businesses.
they
also
used
trademark
experts,
business
consultants,
and
alberto-culver
used
its
outside
auditors
peat,
marwick,
mitchell
&
company.
part
of
the
purchase
price
for
the
companies
was
paid
in
the
form
of
promissory,
four
promissory
notes
which
were
delivered
to
the
petitioner
mr.
scherk
at
the
time
of
the
closing
in
geneva.
now,
in
1970
alberto-culver
concluded
that
petitioner
mr.
scherk
had
breached
trademark
warranties,
having
to
do
with
trademarks
that
had
been
owned
by
the
scherk
enterprises.
and
he
charged
--
they
charged
a
violation
--
they
brought
suit
notwithstanding
the
arbitration
clause,
brought
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
charging
in
june
of
1971,
charging
violations
of
section
10
(b),
rule
10b-5
charged
common
law,
deceit,
fraud,
and
charged
a
breach
of
warranty
--
breach
of
trademark
warranty.
and
mr.
scherk
had
taken
steps
to
arbitrate
the
controversy
in
paris
back
in
january
of
1971.
but
he
had
not
filed
the
necessary
papers
take
on
to
formal
steps.
those
steps
were
not
taken
until
after
the
suit
in
this
case
was
filed.
those
steps
were
taken.
arbitration
was
commenced
officially
or
formally
in
november
of
1971.
we
filed
motions
to
dismiss
the
complaint
based
upon
contentions
that
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction
over
the
person
of
the
petitioner.
the
court
was
without
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter
and
on
the
basis
of
forum
non
conveniens.
in
the
alternative,
we
also
applied
for
a
stay
pending
arbitration,
stay
of
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court.
our
motions
were
all
denied
and
the
district
court
granted
an
injunction
enjoining
the
petitioner
mr.
scherk
from
proceeding
with
arbitration
in
paris.
the
seventh
circuit
affirmed,
analyzing
and
applying
the
court’s
1953
decision
in
wilko
versus
swan
as
invalidating
arbitration
clauses
and
of
course
on
the
wilko
against
swan,
the
invalidation
was
with
respect
to
charges
--
was
in
the
face
of
charges
under
the
securities
act
of
1933.
here,
we
are
talking
about
the
--
and
here
is
the
seventh
circuit
applied
wilko
v.
swan
in
the
phase
of
charges
of
violations,
the
exchange
act
in
10b-5.
our
position
--
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
federal
district
court
has
now
ruled
and
in
the
face
of
our
motion
to
dismiss
on
jurisdictional
grounds
we
believe
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
--
if
you
are
asking
me
as
far
as
the
preliminary
injunction
is
concerned,
the
court
of
appeals
has
ruled
that
it
had
jurisdiction
under
1292
(a)
(1).
we
certainly
agree
with
that
contention.
this
was
the
granting
of
an
injunction,
a
preliminary
injunction.
we
have,
as
far
as
our
motion
to
dismiss
was
not
certified
here
and
that
issue
i
believe
is
just
not
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
is
a
security
of
whether
or
not
mr.
scherk
was
properly
before
the
court,
i
don’t
think
is
any
longer
subject
to
debate
in
these
proceedings.
we
have
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
parties
--
over
the
subject
matter
and
that
this
appeal
was
properly
before
this
court
as
a
preliminary
injunction
under
1292.
our
position
here
is
that
this
court
upon
a
re-analysis
of
wilko
versus
swan
in
the
light
of
the
international
context
here
and
a
strong
federal
policy
favoring
arbitration
need
not
and
should
not
apply
wilko
versus
swan
mechanically
--
mechanistically
and
invalidate
arbitration
agreements
where
security
violations
are
alleged
in
this
international
context.
there
is
no
compelling
reason
to
extend
wilko
versus
swan.
and
some
very
great
good
reasons
we
assert
of
why
wilko
should
not
be
applied
in
these
circumstances.
circuit
judge
stevens
said
in
his
dissenting
opinion
below,
“the
enforcement
of
these
arbitration
agreements
in
this
case
would
not
frustrate
the
policies
of
the
exchange
act
whereas
refusal
to
enforce
them
would
certainly
frustrate
important
policies
which
this
court
is
articulated
as
recently
as
1972
in
the
zapata
case.”
it’s
clear,
i
believe,
it’s
absolutely
clear
that
without
wilko
versus
swan,
the
arbitration
provisions
in
these
–
in
this
acquisition
–
on
these
acquisition
agreements
would
be
enforced.
they
be
enforced
under
either
chapter
one
or
chapter
2
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
we
look
in
vain
and
have
read
the
briefs
in
vain
for
any
reason
to
support
the
mechanical
application
of
wilko
versus
swan
to
the
situation
here.
the
respondent
is
not
going
to
lose
his
right
to
be
heard
on
these
trademark
--
these
breaches
of
trademark,
the
arbitration,
the
arbitral
courts
have
and
can
arbitrate
matters
going
to
allegations
of
fraud
and
breaches
of
warranty.
the
respondent
says
in
effect,
“i
agree
to
arbitrate.
now,
i
do
not
want
to
arbitrate
anymore.
and
i
look
around
and
i
found
this
supreme
court
cases.
1953
cases
says
i
don’t
have
to
and
it
gives
me
an
excuse
so
i
am
not
going
to
live
up
to
my
bargain.”
and
the
respondent
points
to
the
language
of
section
27
of
the
exchange
act
which
says
that
district
courts
shall
have
explosive
jurisdiction
of
violations
to
the
title
or
the
rules
and
regulations
there
under
and
that
all
suits
an
equity
in
actions
in
law
to
enforce
any
liability
or
duly
created
under
the
title
and
so
forth
will
be
in
the
district
court.
now,
he
points
to
that
–
the
respondent
points
the
language
and
says
that,
“as
i
understand
his
argument
that
all
securities
disputes
must
be
resolved
in
the
united
states
district
courts.”
that
does
not
comport
with
reality.
the
securities
exchange
commission
is
resolving
securities
disputes
everyday
in
arbitration
proceedings
where
the
matters
are
involved,
existing
disputes
are
being
arbitrated
everyday.
we
are
having
resolution
of
securities
problems
and
arbitration
proceedings
between
members
of
exchanges
where
they
have
rules
requiring
arbitration.
we
are
having
arbitration
in
securities
matters
and
proceedings
between
non-members
and
members
of
exchanges.
and
we’re
having
arbitration
proceedings
where
the
broker
opposes
arbitration
and
the
customer
fixes
it,
and
it
just
doesn’t
follow.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
technically,
your
honor,
i
believe
we
would
have
to
concede
under
the
cases
that
for
the
purpose,
at
least
to
this
argument,
we
concede
that
there
are
promissory
notes
involved.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
no,
well.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
there
was
a
purchase
of
assets.
there
was
a
purchase
of
a
going
business
concern.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
there
were
some
--
your
honor
that’s
90%
accurate.
there
were
some
trademark
rights
and
some
rights
in
israel
and
in
other
parts
of
the
world
that
were
reserved
by
mr.
scherk,
but
basically
they
acquired,
the
respondent
required
his
business
enterprise.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
he
acquired
stock
in
a
company
or
business
--
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
it
was
liechtenstein
anstalt,
your
honor,
and
at
the
time
of
the
transaction,
at
the
time
of
the
re-entering
into
it,
it
was
not
a
stock
company.
it
was
specifically
not
a
stock
company.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
it
was
converted
as
part
of
the
transaction
and
stock
was
issued
and
was
delivered
and
at
the
time
of
the
closing
it
was
held
in
escrow.
i
think
the
point
on
this
is
that
if
we
permit
these
four
promissory
notes
and
this
transformed
german
--
liechtenstein
anstalt
to
establish
the
rule
for
the
court
and
automatically
--
the
court
would
automatically
apply
wilko
versus
swan
in
that
situation
with
those
connecting
factors.
it’s
our
position
that
you
are
certainly
permitting
form
to
rule
substance
and
that
there
is
no
reason
--
there
is
no
countervailing,
in
these
–
in
this
circumstance,
there
is
no
countervailing
policy
with
respect
to
the
enforcement
of
the
securities
laws
in
this
situation
that
would
justify
that.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
your
honor
i
have
read
the
cases
and
have
seen
the
extension
of
this
definition
of
securities
to
include
and
i
do
not
like
to
state
and
argue
by
myself
but
i
--
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
no,
your
honor.
not
to
my
satisfaction
but
nevertheless
i
think
that
the
--
our
point
here
is
that
if
really
is
not,
it’s
not
necessary
for
us
to
fight
any
longer
on
that
point
because
there
is
just
really
no
requirement
here
to
apply
wilko
versus
swan
if
we
--
arguendo
if
we
are
within
the
securities
exchange
ambit
in
this
case
and
we
argue
that
and
we
lost
that
in
the
district
court
and
we
have
considered
for
the
sake
of
this
argument.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
well
--
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
alright,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
that’s
right,
your
honor.
that’s
right.
we
say
--
mr.
chief
justice
we
say
that
wilko
just
doesn’t
fit
here.
it
was
a
garden
variety
domestic
case
involving
a
customer
of
a
brokerage
house
who
would
sign
the
17-page
form
agreement
provided
by
the
brokerage
house,
contained
an
arbitration
clause
along
with
other
provisions
which
waived
the
protection
of
federal
securities
law.
there
was
a
great
disparity
in
bargaining
positions,
great
disparity
in
the
relative
degrees
of
sophistication,
just
a
very
clear
disparity
in
bargaining
power.
there
was
no
compelling
reason
not
to
relieve
the
customer
of
his
agreement
to
arbitrate
under
circumstances
and
some
fairly
compelling
reasons
to
show
that
it
would
have
been
unfair
to
require
him
to
arbitrate
under
the
circumstances.
our
situation
is
entirely
different.
alberto-culver
went
to
europe.
they
purchased
these
short
businesses.
they
used
an
array
of
european-american
lawyers,
trademark
experts,
business
consultants.
the
sophisticated
businessman
here
agreed
to
arbitrate
their
disputes.
after
a
two-year,
arm’s
length
transaction,
there
was
no
over-winning
bargaining
power
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner.
it’s
clear
also
that
alberto-culver
considered
the
possibility
that
they’re
going
to
have
trademark
problems.
mr.
silver,
their
general
counsel’s
affidavit
here
shows
--
evidences
great
concern
about
trademarks
as
shown
also
by
the
fact
that
the
trademark
warranties
took
up
some
25
pages
in
the
acquisition
agreement.
they
clearly
anticipated
trademark
as
area
of
possible
future
dispute.
and
to
permit
the
respondent
to
refuse
to
honor
its
promise
to
arbitrate
in
an
agreed
forum
where
the
agreement
was
reached
in
good
faith
after
free
and
fair
bargaining
between
the
parties
with
equal
bargaining
power
just
plain
isn’t
fair.
wilko
should
be
extended
to
permit
an
american
businessman,
that
dishonored
his
agreement
with
a
foreigner
and
certainly
the
foreign
aspects
that
are
compelling
enough.
the
international
aspects
to
this
case
are
compelling
enough
not
to
extend
the
wilko
rule
in
this
case.
we
know
that
uncertainty
--
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
arbitral
court
should
resolve
all
of
the
questions,
all
of
the
factual
questions
here.
yes,
we
do.
we
don’t
think
we
are
in
a
situation
where
it’s
necessary
to
remand
the
case
here
to
make
a
determination
whether
there
are
these
policy
matters
present
in
this
case.
the
--
it’s
very
clear
--
that
it's
very
clear
here
that
there
is
no,
at
least,
it’s
clear
to
me
that
there
is
no
countervailing
policy
present.
there
is
no
shown
and
the
matter
has
been
argued,
there
is
no
showing
here
that
under
the
facts
in
this
case
with
arbitration
that
there
would
be
a
concomitant
detriment
to
security
law
enforcement.
so,
i
would
say
that
this
matter
should
be
resolved
by
the
court,
by
the
arbitral
court
in
paris
in
accordance
with
the
solemn
agreement
of
the
parties.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
your
honor,
i
can
see
areas
that
--
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
your
honor,
we
can
certainly
hypothecate
factual
situations
in
which
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
not
to
apply
wilko
versus
swan
in
this
particular
case.
assume
a
british
company
coming
over
and
making
a
tender
offer
on
a
widely
held
corporation
and
that
kind
of
a
situation.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
well,
what
we’ve
tried
to
show
your
honor
is
that
under
section
27,
the
courts
have
not
been
requiring
that
all
securities
disputes
be
resolved
in
the
district
courts.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
well,
we
hope
we’ve
shown
your
honor
that
it
would
be
--
that
because
of
the
policies
that
were
established
by
this
court
or
articulated
in
this
court
in
zapata
that
it
would
be
unfair
and
it
would
be
unnecessary
to
extend
zapata
into
this
international
situation.
i
am
sorry,
i
mean
in
wilko
versus
swan.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
and
we
believe
that
as
in
zapata,
your
honor
that
the
issues
in
this
case
are
ripe
for
determination
by
the
arbitral
court.
the
thing
we
didn’t
and
have
a
chance,
we
really
haven’t
mention
was
the
uncertainty
in
this
international
transactions
which
are
the
real
bugaboo
of
these
international
transactions
and
it’s
essential
for
the
foreign
businessmen
to
know
in
advance
where
and
how
they’re
going
to
resolve
their
conflicts.
the
parties
bring
to
the
bargaining
table
different
legal
theories
and
they
pay
for,
they
arbitrate
and
they
negotiate
and
they
pay
for
these
arbitration
clauses.
in
fact,
they
may
be
the
sine
qua
non
of
an
international
transaction.
in
the
wilko
garden
variety,
securities
matter
where
you’re
are
buying
securities
from
a
broker.
there
is
no
compelling
reason
that
the
parties
have
such
certainly,
but
they
certainly
need
that
certainty
in
international
transaction.
and
one
of
the
things
that’s
happened
of
course
since
wilko
is
that
we
have
articulated
a
strong
national
policy
in
favor
of
arbitration
of
international
transactions
both
in
chapter
2
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
also
in
the
accession
in
the
united
nations
treaty
for
the
enforcement
of
arbitral
awards
and
we
think
--
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
yes.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
if
there
are
facts
i
would
certainly
agree,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
would
certainly
agree
if
there
are
facts
to
be
resolved
that
they
may
have
to
be
resolved
as
the
court
indicated
in
zapata.
i
don’t
see
them.
frankly,
i
don’t
see
any
facts
for
resolution
with
respect
to
public
policy
in
the
matter
–
in
the
case
that's
before
your
honors.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
i
would
concede
it.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
i
think
not.
it
was
a
garden
variety,
customer
of
a
brokerage
house,
hayden
stone.
hayden
stone
sends
almost
17-page
form
contract,
adhesion
contract,
signs
an
arbitration
clause,
tremendous
disparity
and
bargaining
of
power,
tremendous
disparity
and
relative
bargaining
strengths,
business
acumen,
sophistication.
it’s
just
exactly
the
antithesis
of
your
situation
with
their
battery
of
lawyers
and
experts
who
looked
at
this
as
a
sophisticated
businessmen
and
got
together
after
two
years
and
agreed
that
we
are
going
to
arbitrate
the
very
kinds
of
disputes
that
have
arisen
here
in
paris
and
what
a
shocking
surprise
that
must
be
to
wake
up
and
find
that
your
--
you
negotiate,
your
going
to
be
required
to
resolve
your
conflicts
in
the
united
states
district
court.
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
well,
i
understood
--
mr.
robert
f.
hanley
well,
it
may
--
it
may
be
a
security
your
honor
and
in
this
particular
situation
assuming
as
a
security
we
are
saying
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
this
court
to
effectuate
the
rule,
to
apply
the
rule,
to
extend
the
rule
in
wilko
versus
swan
and
to
prevent
arbitration
here.
