but
you
see
you
have
a
federal
statue
and
it
would
be
amazing
i
think
that
anybody
who
has
worked
in
the
field
to
assume
that
if
i
bought
out
a
company,
lock,
stock
and
barrel
with
a
stock
and
the
ventures
and
everything
else
that
wasn’t
a
security?
justice
william
o.
douglas
read
the
definition
in
section
3810
of
the
exchange
act
34.
it
would
be
driving
at
a
hole
in
the
act
that
big
enough
to
send
the
caravan
through?
justice
william
o.
douglas
in
this
field
you
don’t
talk
about
equity,
you
talk
about
the
law,
whether
or
not
you
have
a
security
or
you
don’t
have
a
security?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
you
haven’t
cited
anything
in
the
brief.
it
is
contrary
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
here?
justice
william
o.
douglas
as
you
see
this
definition
of
security
doesn’t
--
in
34,
it
doesn’t
turn
upon
how
strong
one
party
is
and
how
weak
the
other
party
is.
this
is
the
generalized
wide
category?
justice
william
o.
douglas
a
very
unusual
situation
to
acquire
all
this
lock
--
company
lock,
stock,
and
barrel
securities
and
to
match
up
saying
that’s
not
a
security,
that
is
much
more
than
a
person
who
is
working
a
deal
who
can
swallow
at
least
more
quickly?
justice
william
o.
douglas
there
are
a
lot
of
financial
refugees
around
the
world
who
do
not
dare
to
return
to
their
own
country.
they
would
welcome
arbitration
queries
in
paris.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
am
talking
about
the
refugees.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
am
sure
they
would
to
avoid
the
rigors
of
their
regime
at
home.
justice
william
o.
douglas
it's
not
political
i
am
talking
about.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
thinking
in
terms
of
the
problems
of
security,
regulation
of
securities
in
switzerland,
here,
england
and
elsewhere.
