mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
i
correctly
understand
the
main
thrust
of
your
argument
is
that
given
the
long
standing
judicial
and
legislative
policy
to
encourage
arbitration,
that
that
should
be
followed
absent
compelling
reasons
of
public
policy
not
to
do
so
and
that
there
are
no
compelling
reasons
of
public
policy
presented
here
as
there
were
in
wilko?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
zapata
was
a
common
law
case,

it
not,

very
well,
mr.

mr.
aksen.

justice
warren
e.
burger
well
is
that
presented
in

chief

warren
e.
burger
the
jurisdiction
of
a
united
states
court
to
deal
with
what
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
raised
to
you,
that
is
the
award
when
as
and
if
one
was
made,
is
a
question
not
now
before
the
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
we
not
have
something
to
say
in
the
zapata
case
of
the
impact
on
international
trade
and
commerce
if
arm’s
length
transactions

not
freely
commit
themselves
to
arbitration.
wasn’t

some
discussions

e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
gerald
aksen.
mr.
higgins.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
not
just
because
he
is
a
foreigner

because
he
made
an
agreement
and
he
is
also
a
foreigner,
isn’t
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
could
understand
that.
i
could
follow
that
much
more
readily
if
you
have
a
swiss
or
german
or
french
corporation
coming
into
this
country
selling
securities
in
the
traditional

issuing
