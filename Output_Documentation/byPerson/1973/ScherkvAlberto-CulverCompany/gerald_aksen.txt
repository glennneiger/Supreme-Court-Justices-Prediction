mr.
gerald
aksen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
american
arbitration
association
as
amicus
in
this
matter
is
terribly
concerned
not
with
the
merits
of
this
particular
case,
but
the
impact
of
international
business
contract
drafting.
we
have
at
issue
here,
not
the
public
policy
attached
to
the
issuance
of
an
arbitration
award
because
that
has
not
yet
occurred.
we
have
a
standard
type
of
business
transaction
where
two
parties
from
different
countries
who
cannot
agree
to
the
choice
of
law
of
a
different
foreign
country
or
foreign
court,
who
typically
provide
for
a
dispute
settlement
mechanism,
usually
arbitration.
in
this
instance,
the
tribunal
is
a
worldwide
well-known
tribunal,
the
international
chamber
of
commerce
sitting
at
paris.
the
arbitration
clause
provides
for
a
neutral
country
between
this
american
and
this
german.
both
of
these
countries
have
ratified
a
treaty,
united
nations
convention
on
the
recognition
and
enforcement
of
foreign
awards,
but
that
convention
contains
within
it
a
specific
provision
of
the
enforcement
of
arbitration
agreements.
the
convention
also
states
the
specific
grounds
upon
which
a
court
may
refuse
to
honor
that
agreement.
i
would
call
to
your
attention
that
public
policy
is
not
one
of
those
listed
grounds.
i
think
it
is
very
important
to
know
that
four
major
developments
occurred
in
this
country
within
the
past
few
years,
dealing
with
this
convention.
the
first
is
the
fact
that
congress
amended
chapter
2
of
the
federal
arbitration
act.
this
court
was
only
ruling
upon
chapter
1
of
the
federal
arbitration
act
in
1953
in
the
wilko
case.
congress
not
only
added
a
new
chapter
to
that
act,
but
the
senate
advised
and
consented
on
this
international
treaty.
only
two
years
ago,
the
government
of
the
united
states
in
a
series
of
joint
agreements
with
the
russians,
the
polish
and
more
agreements
are
forthcoming
have
provided
for
this
mechanism,
the
use
of
voluntary
arbitration
in
a
neutral
country
to
resolve
all
commercial,
business
disputes.
finally,
only
this
year
the
american
bar
association
and
its
house
of
delegates
wrote
a
letter
to
all
of
the
other
countries
of
the
world
through
their
bar
associations,
advising
and
recommending
that
they
pass
this
convention
which
has
now
been
passed
in
42
countries
of
the
world.
there
is
no
other
practical
way
to
settle
international
business
disputes
and
though
the
arbitration
mechanism.
mr.
gerald
aksen
the
un
convention,
your
honor,
provides
in
a
section
on
enforcement
of
awards
that
the
host
country
may
of
course
refuse
to
honor
the
arbitration
award
if
it
would
offend
its
public
policy.
it
does
not
so
provide
on
the
section
dealing
with
enforcement
of
arbitration
agreements
which
is
article
ii
of
the
convention.
we
feel
that
--
mr.
gerald
aksen
well,
your
honor
it
does
not.
it
does
not
and
in
fact
amicus
does
not
argue
that
this
court
should
make
a
distinction
between
agreements
and
an
award
because
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
have
two
separate
forums
trying
the
same
thing
over
again.
mr.
gerald
aksen
amicus
has
not
so
argued
in
this
case.
i
was
just
pointing
out
the
exact
language
of
the
convention,
should
the
court
wish
to
narrow
its
issue
to
the
scope
of
the
arbitration
agreement
itself.
mr.
gerald
aksen
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
not
now
before
the
court.
mr.
gerald
aksen
the
only
workable
line
to
accommodate
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
the
old
wilko
v.
swan
argument
is
to
take
a
very
hard
look
at
recent
times.
now,
all
of
the
developments
that
we
have
listed
for
you
in
the
brief
have
occurred
since
1953.
two
administrations,
democratic
and
republican
in
this
country
have
recognized
the
need
for
this
mechanism
to
resolve
disputes.
if
you
find
that
with
the
wording
of
this
convention,
you
can
let
one
party,
an
american
party
refuse
to
honor
this
arbitration
agreement
and
in
the
words
of
mr.
justice
douglas,
you
will
drive
a
caravan
though
this
convention.
now
this
convention
was
passed
in
this
country
--
mr.
gerald
aksen
i
think
mr.
justice
douglas
that
all
of
the
businessmen
in
the
world
would
welcome
the
free
use
of
arbitration.
mr.
gerald
aksen
if
they
are
businessmen,
your
honor,
i
think
they
would
welcome
arbitration.
mr.
gerald
aksen
i
am
perhaps
missing
something,
but
i
am
not
sure
if
a
political
type
--
mr.
gerald
aksen
--
problem
with
refugees
is
relevant
to
the
definition
of
commerce
as
defined
by
the
convention.
mr.
gerald
aksen
well,
i
think
it
is
clear
if
this
court
finds
that
the
securities
matters
in
this
case
which
we
consider
peripheral,
but
if
the
court
finds
that
these
securities
matters
are
controlling,
then
it
has
a
very
difficult
time
accommodating
these
two
statutes.
but
in
this
case
we
do
have
a
statutory
problem
and
the
most
recent
statute
is
one
of
both
of
convention
and
an
enactment
or
reenactment
getting
a
full
chapter
to
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
with
language,
may
i
point
out
that
was
not
required.
the
convention
does
not
require
any
court
of
any
country
to
force
a
native
to
go
abroad
to
arbitrate.
mr.
gerald
aksen
then
there
would
be
no
doubt
in
of
my
mind
and
the
wilko
attitude
should
prevail
but
this
is
--
mr.
gerald
aksen
yes.
mr.
gerald
aksen
we
think
not.
mr.
gerald
aksen
no,
because
i
think
when
you
talk
of
public
policy,
wilko
would
have
had
to
have
said
that
you
cannot
only,
not
agree
to
arbitrate
future
disputes,
but
you
could
not
agree
to
arbitrate
an
existing
dispute.
wilko
did
not
say
that.
but
the
sense
clearly
pointed
out
that
they
were
not
deciding
whether
or
not
two
american
parties
could
agree
to
arbitrate
an
existing
securities
question.
mr.
gerald
aksen
that
is
correct,
but
i
don’t
think
that
is
sufficient
public
policy
of
the
kind
required.
mr.
gerald
aksen
it
clearly
did,
your
honor
in
a
domestic
transaction
between
two
americans
who
were
fully
aware
of
the
local
statutory
provisions.
mr.
gerald
aksen
you
certainly
did
mr.
justice
burger
and
we
hardly
endorse
the
language
from
the
zapata
public
opinion.
if
you
would
have
inserted
arbitration
rather
than
that
choice
of
forum.
we
think
that
all
you’re
doing
is
moving
very
slightly
from
the
zapata
case
to
this
one.
we’re
not
really
asking
the
court
here
for
a
very
drastic
change
in
american
law.
in
fact,
in
domestic
law
this
court
has
already
ruled,
that
if
you
have
a
problem
of
fraud
and
the
inducement
or
misrepresentation
in
prima
paint
then
that
is
a
matter
for
the
arbitrator
between
prima
paint
and
zapata
and
moving
very
slightly
to
another
rule
in
this
case
which
would
encourage
the
use
of
international
commercial
arbitration.
thank
you.
