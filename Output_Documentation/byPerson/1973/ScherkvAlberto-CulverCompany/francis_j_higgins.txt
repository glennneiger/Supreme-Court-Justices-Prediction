mr.
francis
j.
higgins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
turning
to
what
i
consider
to
be
some
inaccuracies
in
the
statement
of
facts
made
by
my
brethren.
i
would
like
to
make
this
observation
after
having
heard
the
arguments.
the
two
concessions
which
have
been
made
here
by
counsel
which
i
thought
were
impliedly
conceded
in
the
briefs
as
well,
namely
that
(1)
personal
jurisdiction
exists
and
(2)
subject
matter
jurisdiction
exists
that
is
the
coverage
of
the
act,
leaves
the
petitioner
in
logic
to
ask
this
court
to
overrule
wilko
versus
swan.
that,
i
think
is
the
necessary
impact
of
their
position.
now,
why
were
these
concessions
made?
two
reasons,
one
factual
the
other
legal.
first
of
all,
the
petitioner
has
consistently
overlooked
the
fact
that
securities
fraud
was
committed
in
this
country
within
the
territorial
boundaries
of
united
states
to
the
injury
of
an
american
citizen.
recent
decisions
including
the
leasco
case
in
the
second
circuit
and
the
travis
case
in
the
eighth
circuit
have
applied
the
act
to
this
type
of
situation,
whether
negotiated
or
not.
so,
if
the
act
applies,
section
29
(a)
must
apply
as
well.
now,
a
suggestion
has
been
made,
the
29
(a)
should
not
be
the
same
as
14.
since
the
language
of
the
two
statutes
is
the
same
we
fail
to
see
how
that
can
occur.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
of
the
34
act
is
identical
to
14
of
the
33
act.
what
is
the
ultimate
logic
of
the
petitioner’s
position
here?
it
is
that
my
client,
an
american
company
is
not
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
29
(a)
which
bars
any
stipulation
by
any
person
to
waive
compliance
with
the
act.
that
we
submit
is
a
matter
of
statutory
logic,
construction
and
policy
and
should
not
be
followed
by
this
court.
the
convention
makes
no
change
in
this
law.
in
fact
it
expressly
accommodates
wilko
and
29
(a)
in
international
transactions.
consider
the
effect,
if
the
court
will,
if
you
were
to
recognize
an
exception
to
this
act
wherever
the
defendant
is
a
foreigner,
even
though
he
has
come
into
this
country
to
fraud
an
american
citizen
he
is
concededly
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts.
he
can
escape
it
because
he
is
a
foreigner.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
he
made
an
agreement,
but
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
is
a
person.
the
agreement
is
a
stipulation
chief
justice
burger
and
section
27
of
the
act
creating
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
a
provision.
now,
if
you
can
see
as
the
petitioner
has
done
here,
that
the
act
applies,
it
must
necessarily
follow
we
submit
that
section
29
(a)
applies
and
section
27
also
applies.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
that
because
i
think
this
is
the
heart
of
chief
judge
friendly's
position
in
leasco.
there
you
had
securities
which
were
totally
foreign.
you
had
a
negotiated
transaction.
you
had
foreign
defendants.
and
nevertheless,
the
court
there
held
on
traditional
principles
of
international
law,
foreign
relations
law
of
the
united
states
that
what
was
key
was
not
whether
if
the
securities
were
those
of
a
foreign
corporation,
but
whether
or
not
that
company
through
its
representatives
in
the
concededly
negotiated
transaction
came
to
this
country
and
here
on
our
soil
defrauded
an
american
citizen.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
no.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
correct.
and
that
brings
as
i
suppose
to
an
analysis
or
proper
analysis
of
both
29
(a)
and
wilko
because
we
concededly
have
power
over
this
man,
albeit
he
is
a
foreigner.
our
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
him
just
as
they
had
jurisdiction
over
the
defendant
in
wilko.
now,
we
submit
that
the
petitioner
here
has
mis-characterized
this
court’s
holding
in
wilko
or
misunderstood
it.
it
is
true
that
that
case
involved
a
suit
by
a
customer
against
the
brokerage
house,
but
what
the
court
had
before
it
section
14
of
the
33
act
was
again
like
29
(a)
of
the
34
act,
a
statute
of
general
applicability.
it
purported
to
benefit
or
protect
any
person
signing
any
stipulation
agreement
or
a
provision
waiving
compliance
with
any
portion
of
the
act.
the
majority
opinion
stated
on
its
face,
the
opinion
of
justice
reid,
“that
we
recognize
under
the
certain
circumstances,
buyers
and
sellers
of
securities
may
bargain
at
arm’s
length,
but
we
nevertheless
hold
that
the
intention
of
congress
is
better
carried
out
by
finding
void
any
agreement
to
arbitrate
a
future
dispute.”
it
was
a
statement
of
general
applicability.
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
justice
frankfurter
recognized
this.
he
said,
“we
do
not
have
before
us
here
a
case
of
overreaching,
a
case
of
coercion”
and
he
nevertheless
concluded
in
the
last
sentence,
“i
read
the
majority’s
opinion
to
be
a
general
limitation,
a
general
limitation
on
the
federal
arbitration
act.”
now
that
was
the
law
as
it
stood
in
1970.
petitioner
would
have
the
court
believe
that
it
is
we
who
are
trying
to
expand
the
law.
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth.
the
question
is
whether
the
convention
repealed
section
29
(a)
and
section
14.
and
for
the
reasons
which
have
been
outlined
already
here
in
argument,
we
feel
that
an
argument
of
repealer
here
was
totally
without
merit.
the
state
department,
when
they
prepared
a
memorandum
for
the
president,
pointed
out
that
these
provisions
of
public
policy,
incapable
of
being
enforced
are
intended
to
take
account
of
the
laws
which
prohibit
the
submission
of
certain
questions
to
arbitration.
wilko
is
such
a
holding
section
14
is
such
a
law,
section
29
(a)
is
such
a
law.
now,
the
two
exceptions
--
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
well,
i
think
when
you
talk
about
renege,
i
don’t
think
that
parties,
when
they
are
entering
into
negotiations
of
this
type
assume
or
necessarily
foresee
that
there
is
going
to
be
securities
fraud
committed
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
it’s
the
argument
that
we
should
say
to
him,
“now
look
if
you
commit
fraud,
there
is
in
our
country
the
case
called
wilko
or
a
section
29
(a).”
that’s
unreal
bargaining
process
as
i
understand
it.
also,
the
concept
of
reneging.
if
we
call
this
reneging
as
no
more
reneging
that
when
mr.
wilko
did
or
mr.
boyd
or
mr.
argüelles
or
mr.
alexander.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
but
i
was
attempting
to
point
out
justice
rehnquist
that
that’s
not
what
the
case
involved.
as
the
case
emerged
through
the
court
system
and
as
it
got
to
the
supreme
court,
there
was
no
contention
of
any
overreaching,
coercion
and
in
fact,
justice
frankfurter
mentioned
this,
“i
do
not
see
why
we
are
deciding
this
case
this
way
because
there
is
no
disparity
of
bargaining
power
here.”
no
showing
that
this
man
had
designed
this
contract.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
i
would
assume
that
if
there
was
a
straight
non-securities
violation
of
breach
of
contract
it
would
be
applicable,
yes.
but
what
makes
this
unique
and
different
is
the
applicability
of
what
mr.
justice
douglas
accurately
referred
to
as
the
clear
provisions
of
the
exchange
act.
there
is
no
question
here
we
have
stock,
we
purchased
stock
within
the
meaning
of
3
(a)
10.
no
question
about
what
the
6
(d),
long-term
promissory
notes
which
were
issued
for
securities.
hence,
we
have
a
situation
here
which
is
similar
to
a
number
of
domestic
cases
which
are
known
to
the
parties
here
where
the
securities
acts
and
the
securities
exchange
act
have
been
applied
to
the
acquisition
of
all
the
stock
of
a
business.
they
have
been
applied
to
acquisitions
of
interest
in
closed
corporations
and
in
fact,
this
court
expressly
set
in
the
banker’s
life
case
that
the
construction
of
this
act
is
to
be
liberal
and
that
it
protects
corporations
--
protects
corporations
as
well
as
individuals.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
no.
i
do
not
believe
it
would
justice
white.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
in
fact
they
did
stipulate
on
illinois
law.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
and
this
is
another
factor
here
which
--
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
yes.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
it
hasn’t
been
so
far
but
--
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
yes,
no
question.
it
does
obtain
the
benefits
of
arbitration
outside
the
exchange
act
and
they
can
also
select
their
applicable
law.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
no,
no
if
the
stipulation
in
advance
to
waive
the
provisions
of
the
exchange
act
is
void
in
advance.
at
least
in
advance.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
correct.
as
i
read--
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
yes
and
the
defendant
is
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
we
always
have
this
limitation
that
he
must
have
done
something
to
bring
him
within
our
power
to
begin
with
and
then
when
he
is
done
to
that
something
it
ceases
us
to
be
what’s
called
in
the
petitioner’s
brief,
“a
mere
international
commercial
transactions.”
the
transaction
indeed
may
be
international,
but
that
fraud
is
domestic
and
it
is
that
fraud,
the
domestic
fraud
which
confers
both
personal
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
gives
the
plaintiff,
the
injured
plaintiff
the
right
to
access
in
the
united
states
courts.
under
the
33
act
it
would
be
either
state
or
federal
as
he
chose
and
under
the
34
act
it
would
be
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts,
but
you
asked
about
the
illinois
law
provision.
this
is
again
a
factor
which
is
probably
not
necessary
to
our
position
under
this
case,
but
certainly
it
reinforces
it.
as
the
amicus,
the
aaa
points
out
in
his
brief
when
the
party
is
selected
illinois
law,
they
ipso
facto
by
operation
of
law
selected
federal
law
to
the
extent
that
it’s
applicable.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
right,
justice
stewart
but
the
aaa
in
its
amicus
brief
pointed
out
accurately,
we
believe,
that
when
party
selects
state
law
they
also
select
federal
law
to
the
extent
that
that
is
under
the
supremacy
clause,
part
of
the
law
of
the
state,
but
this
is
simply
another
quite
aside
from
that
legal
argument.
this
is
simply
another
american
nexus
to
this
transaction.
that
here’s
a
party
scherk
who
contracted
with
specific
reference
to
the
laws
of
this
country.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
the
record
indicates
that
there
were
certain
tax
considerations
which
alberto-culver
deserved.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
well,
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
having
a
deal
made.
it
was
our
wish,
scherk
have
agreed
with
it,
and
in
order
to
effectuate
the
transaction,
he
converted
his
anstalt
into
a
stock
corporation.
we
purchased
the
stock
and
issued
the
notes.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
yes.
zapata
has
been
mentioned.
the
zapata
is
indeed
an
important
case,
but
the
chief
justice’s
opinion
in
zapata
clearly
indicates
room
and
in
fact
explicitly
makes
room
for
this
type
of
case.
the
opinion
states
that
choice
of
forum
provision
should
be
declared
void
if
it’s
contravened
statutory
or
judicially
declared
public
policy.
and
in
support
of
that
proposition,
the
chief
justice's
opinion
cited
boyd
versus
grand
trunk
western
railroad.
boyd
was
the
first
of
the
string
of
cases
which
this
court
has
decided.
there,
a
railroad
employee
restricted
his
right
of
venue
under
the
statute.
in
fact
it
was
after
the
dispute
arose
in
boyd,
nevertheless,
this
court
held
that
agreement
was
void
to
the
extent
that
it
attempted
to
deprive
this
man
of
his
right
to
sue
wherever
the
statute
provided
the
railroad
could
be
sued.
boyd
was
relied
on
in
wilko.
now
the
court
said
in
wilko,
“we
notice
in
boyd
that
we
declared
void
a
post
dispute
agreement.
we
do
not
have
to
go
that
far
today
and
we
are
not
doing
so.”
and
it
was
that
i
think
that
led
to
justice
jackson’s
concurring
opinion,
leaving
open
this
question
of
a
post
dispute
agreement.
we
do
not
have
that
situation
here.
if
it
comes
before
the
court,
an
agreement
entered
into
after
the
dispute
arises,
different
policy
considerations
are
going
to
be
applicable.
you
have
a
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
akin
or
analogous
to
a
settlement
agreement.
in
any
event
this
court
has
not
faced
or
decided
that
issue
and
it
does
not
involve
in
the
case
before
the
court
today.
an
argument
could
certainly
be
made
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
that
such
an
agreement
should
be
void
just
as
this
court
held
the
boyd
agreement
was
void.
so
summing
up,
neither
of
the
two
exceptions
which
have
been
urged
here
by
the
petitioner,
namely
the
exception
based
upon
some
concept
of
disparity
of
bargaining
power
or
sophisticated
people,
or
the
fact
that
he
is
a
foreigner
who
chose
to
come
to
this
country
and
subject
himself
to
the
act,
can
hold
substance
either
under
the
language
of
section
29
(a)
or
under
14.
a
suggestion
has
been
made
that
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
a
10b-5
case.
that
this
is
something
very
simple
to
understand,
but
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
an
arbitration
agreement
requires
a
adjudication
of
this
matter
before
a
foreign
tribunal
or
it’s
a
virtual
certainty
that
there
will
be
unfamiliarity
with
this
act,
then
as
this
court
noted
in
bernhardt,
the
remission
of
this
case,
the
change
of
this
case
from
a
court
to
arbitration
would
have
a
very
definite
potential
for
affecting
the
underlying
substantive
right
to
recovery.
arbitration
is
not
simply
in
a
formal
matter,
a
procedural
matter.
this
court
held
it
in
bernhardt
under
the
--
under
an
eerie
question
really,
that
arbitration
versus
the
court
is
a
matter
of
substance,
and
can
affect
and
perhaps
even
destroy
the
plaintiff’s
right
to
recovery.
under
circumstances
where
the
power
of
review,
the
development
of
the
record,
the
lack
of
discovery,
the
lack
of
development
of
unknown
body
of
doctrine
for
the
guidance
of
the
public
and
all
the
other
infirmities
of
arbitration
mentioned
in
wilko
are
equally
applicable
here.
so,
under
the
circumstances
we
ask
this
court
to
follow
its
holding
in
wilko
not
to
overrule
that
case
because
neither
the
statute
nor
the
convention
or
any
other
judicial
authority
requires
or
permits
it,
and
to
affirm
the
judgments
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
of
the
district
court.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
turning
to
what
i
consider
to
be
some
inaccuracies
in
the
statement
of
facts
made
by
my
brethren.
i
would
like
to
make
this
observation
after
having
heard
the
arguments.
the
two
concessions
which
have
been
made
here
by
counsel
which
i
thought
were
impliedly
conceded
in
the
briefs
as
well,
namely
that
(1)
personal
jurisdiction
exists
and
(2)
subject
matter
jurisdiction
exists
that
is
the
coverage
of
the
act,
leaves
the
petitioner
in
logic
to
ask
this
court
to
overrule
wilko
versus
swan.
that,
i
think
is
the
necessary
impact
of
their
position.
now,
why
were
these
concessions
made?
two
reasons,
one
factual
the
other
legal.
first
of
all,
the
petitioner
has
consistently
overlooked
the
fact
that
securities
fraud
was
committed
in
this
country
within
the
territorial
boundaries
of
united
states
to
the
injury
of
an
american
citizen.
recent
decisions
including
the
leasco
case
in
the
second
circuit
and
the
travis
case
in
the
eighth
circuit
have
applied
the
act
to
this
type
of
situation,
whether
negotiated
or
not.
so,
if
the
act
applies,
section
29
(a)
must
apply
as
well.
now,
a
suggestion
has
been
made,
the
29
(a)
should
not
be
the
same
as
14.
since
the
language
of
the
two
statutes
is
the
same
we
fail
to
see
how
that
can
occur.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
of
the
34
act
is
identical
to
14
of
the
33
act.
what
is
the
ultimate
logic
of
the
petitioner’s
position
here?
it
is
that
my
client,
an
american
company
is
not
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
29
(a)
which
bars
any
stipulation
by
any
person
to
waive
compliance
with
the
act.
that
we
submit
is
a
matter
of
statutory
logic,
construction
and
policy
and
should
not
be
followed
by
this
court.
the
convention
makes
no
change
in
this
law.
in
fact
it
expressly
accommodates
wilko
and
29
(a)
in
international
transactions.
consider
the
effect,
if
the
court
will,
if
you
were
to
recognize
an
exception
to
this
act
wherever
the
defendant
is
a
foreigner,
even
though
he
has
come
into
this
country
to
fraud
an
american
citizen
he
is
concededly
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts.
he
can
escape
it
because
he
is
a
foreigner.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
he
made
an
agreement,
but
the
plaintiff
in
the
case
is
a
person.
the
agreement
is
a
stipulation
chief
justice
burger
and
section
27
of
the
act
creating
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
a
provision.
now,
if
you
can
see
as
the
petitioner
has
done
here,
that
the
act
applies,
it
must
necessarily
follow
we
submit
that
section
29
(a)
applies
and
section
27
also
applies.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
that
because
i
think
this
is
the
heart
of
chief
judge
friendly's
position
in
leasco.
there
you
had
securities
which
were
totally
foreign.
you
had
a
negotiated
transaction.
you
had
foreign
defendants.
and
nevertheless,
the
court
there
held
on
traditional
principles
of
international
law,
foreign
relations
law
of
the
united
states
that
what
was
key
was
not
whether
if
the
securities
were
those
of
a
foreign
corporation,
but
whether
or
not
that
company
through
its
representatives
in
the
concededly
negotiated
transaction
came
to
this
country
and
here
on
our
soil
defrauded
an
american
citizen.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
no.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
correct.
and
that
brings
as
i
suppose
to
an
analysis
or
proper
analysis
of
both
29
(a)
and
wilko
because
we
concededly
have
power
over
this
man,
albeit
he
is
a
foreigner.
our
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
him
just
as
they
had
jurisdiction
over
the
defendant
in
wilko.
now,
we
submit
that
the
petitioner
here
has
mis-characterized
this
court’s
holding
in
wilko
or
misunderstood
it.
it
is
true
that
that
case
involved
a
suit
by
a
customer
against
the
brokerage
house,
but
what
the
court
had
before
it
section
14
of
the
33
act
was
again
like
29
(a)
of
the
34
act,
a
statute
of
general
applicability.
it
purported
to
benefit
or
protect
any
person
signing
any
stipulation
agreement
or
a
provision
waiving
compliance
with
any
portion
of
the
act.
the
majority
opinion
stated
on
its
face,
the
opinion
of
justice
reid,
“that
we
recognize
under
the
certain
circumstances,
buyers
and
sellers
of
securities
may
bargain
at
arm’s
length,
but
we
nevertheless
hold
that
the
intention
of
congress
is
better
carried
out
by
finding
void
any
agreement
to
arbitrate
a
future
dispute.”
it
was
a
statement
of
general
applicability.
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
justice
frankfurter
recognized
this.
he
said,
“we
do
not
have
before
us
here
a
case
of
overreaching,
a
case
of
coercion”
and
he
nevertheless
concluded
in
the
last
sentence,
“i
read
the
majority’s
opinion
to
be
a
general
limitation,
a
general
limitation
on
the
federal
arbitration
act.”
now
that
was
the
law
as
it
stood
in
1970.
petitioner
would
have
the
court
believe
that
it
is
we
who
are
trying
to
expand
the
law.
nothing
could
be
farther
from
the
truth.
the
question
is
whether
the
convention
repealed
section
29
(a)
and
section
14.
and
for
the
reasons
which
have
been
outlined
already
here
in
argument,
we
feel
that
an
argument
of
repealer
here
was
totally
without
merit.
the
state
department,
when
they
prepared
a
memorandum
for
the
president,
pointed
out
that
these
provisions
of
public
policy,
incapable
of
being
enforced
are
intended
to
take
account
of
the
laws
which
prohibit
the
submission
of
certain
questions
to
arbitration.
wilko
is
such
a
holding
section
14
is
such
a
law,
section
29
(a)
is
such
a
law.
now,
the
two
exceptions
--
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
yes,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
well,
i
think
when
you
talk
about
renege,
i
don’t
think
that
parties,
when
they
are
entering
into
negotiations
of
this
type
assume
or
necessarily
foresee
that
there
is
going
to
be
securities
fraud
committed
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
it’s
the
argument
that
we
should
say
to
him,
“now
look
if
you
commit
fraud,
there
is
in
our
country
the
case
called
wilko
or
a
section
29
(a).”
that’s
unreal
bargaining
process
as
i
understand
it.
also,
the
concept
of
reneging.
if
we
call
this
reneging
as
no
more
reneging
that
when
mr.
wilko
did
or
mr.
boyd
or
mr.
argüelles
or
mr.
alexander.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
but
i
was
attempting
to
point
out
justice
rehnquist
that
that’s
not
what
the
case
involved.
as
the
case
emerged
through
the
court
system
and
as
it
got
to
the
supreme
court,
there
was
no
contention
of
any
overreaching,
coercion
and
in
fact,
justice
frankfurter
mentioned
this,
“i
do
not
see
why
we
are
deciding
this
case
this
way
because
there
is
no
disparity
of
bargaining
power
here.”
no
showing
that
this
man
had
designed
this
contract.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
i
would
assume
that
if
there
was
a
straight
non-securities
violation
of
breach
of
contract
it
would
be
applicable,
yes.
but
what
makes
this
unique
and
different
is
the
applicability
of
what
mr.
justice
douglas
accurately
referred
to
as
the
clear
provisions
of
the
exchange
act.
there
is
no
question
here
we
have
stock,
we
purchased
stock
within
the
meaning
of
3
(a)
10.
no
question
about
what
the
6
(d),
long-term
promissory
notes
which
were
issued
for
securities.
hence,
we
have
a
situation
here
which
is
similar
to
a
number
of
domestic
cases
which
are
known
to
the
parties
here
where
the
securities
acts
and
the
securities
exchange
act
have
been
applied
to
the
acquisition
of
all
the
stock
of
a
business.
they
have
been
applied
to
acquisitions
of
interest
in
closed
corporations
and
in
fact,
this
court
expressly
set
in
the
banker’s
life
case
that
the
construction
of
this
act
is
to
be
liberal
and
that
it
protects
corporations
--
protects
corporations
as
well
as
individuals.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
no.
i
do
not
believe
it
would
justice
white.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
in
fact
they
did
stipulate
on
illinois
law.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
and
this
is
another
factor
here
which
--
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
yes.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
it
hasn’t
been
so
far
but
--
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
yes,
no
question.
it
does
obtain
the
benefits
of
arbitration
outside
the
exchange
act
and
they
can
also
select
their
applicable
law.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
no,
no
if
the
stipulation
in
advance
to
waive
the
provisions
of
the
exchange
act
is
void
in
advance.
at
least
in
advance.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
correct.
as
i
read--
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
yes
and
the
defendant
is
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
we
always
have
this
limitation
that
he
must
have
done
something
to
bring
him
within
our
power
to
begin
with
and
then
when
he
is
done
to
that
something
it
ceases
us
to
be
what’s
called
in
the
petitioner’s
brief,
“a
mere
international
commercial
transactions.”
the
transaction
indeed
may
be
international,
but
that
fraud
is
domestic
and
it
is
that
fraud,
the
domestic
fraud
which
confers
both
personal
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
gives
the
plaintiff,
the
injured
plaintiff
the
right
to
access
in
the
united
states
courts.
under
the
33
act
it
would
be
either
state
or
federal
as
he
chose
and
under
the
34
act
it
would
be
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts,
but
you
asked
about
the
illinois
law
provision.
this
is
again
a
factor
which
is
probably
not
necessary
to
our
position
under
this
case,
but
certainly
it
reinforces
it.
as
the
amicus,
the
aaa
points
out
in
his
brief
when
the
party
is
selected
illinois
law,
they
ipso
facto
by
operation
of
law
selected
federal
law
to
the
extent
that
it’s
applicable.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
right,
justice
stewart
but
the
aaa
in
its
amicus
brief
pointed
out
accurately,
we
believe,
that
when
party
selects
state
law
they
also
select
federal
law
to
the
extent
that
that
is
under
the
supremacy
clause,
part
of
the
law
of
the
state,
but
this
is
simply
another
quite
aside
from
that
legal
argument.
this
is
simply
another
american
nexus
to
this
transaction.
that
here’s
a
party
scherk
who
contracted
with
specific
reference
to
the
laws
of
this
country.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
the
record
indicates
that
there
were
certain
tax
considerations
which
alberto-culver
deserved.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
well,
it
was
for
the
benefit
of
having
a
deal
made.
it
was
our
wish,
scherk
have
agreed
with
it,
and
in
order
to
effectuate
the
transaction,
he
converted
his
anstalt
into
a
stock
corporation.
we
purchased
the
stock
and
issued
the
notes.
mr.
francis
j.
higgins
yes.
zapata
has
been
mentioned.
the
zapata
is
indeed
an
important
case,
but
the
chief
justice’s
opinion
in
zapata
clearly
indicates
room
and
in
fact
explicitly
makes
room
for
this
type
of
case.
the
opinion
states
that
choice
of
forum
provision
should
be
declared
void
if
it’s
contravened
statutory
or
judicially
declared
public
policy.
and
in
support
of
that
proposition,
the
chief
justice's
opinion
cited
boyd
versus
grand
trunk
western
railroad.
boyd
was
the
first
of
the
string
of
cases
which
this
court
has
decided.
there,
a
railroad
employee
restricted
his
right
of
venue
under
the
statute.
in
fact
it
was
after
the
dispute
arose
in
boyd,
nevertheless,
this
court
held
that
agreement
was
void
to
the
extent
that
it
attempted
to
deprive
this
man
of
his
right
to
sue
wherever
the
statute
provided
the
railroad
could
be
sued.
boyd
was
relied
on
in
wilko.
now
the
court
said
in
wilko,
“we
notice
in
boyd
that
we
declared
void
a
post
dispute
agreement.
we
do
not
have
to
go
that
far
today
and
we
are
not
doing
so.”
and
it
was
that
i
think
that
led
to
justice
jackson’s
concurring
opinion,
leaving
open
this
question
of
a
post
dispute
agreement.
we
do
not
have
that
situation
here.
if
it
comes
before
the
court,
an
agreement
entered
into
after
the
dispute
arises,
different
policy
considerations
are
going
to
be
applicable.
you
have
a
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
akin
or
analogous
to
a
settlement
agreement.
in
any
event
this
court
has
not
faced
or
decided
that
issue
and
it
does
not
involve
in
the
case
before
the
court
today.
an
argument
could
certainly
be
made
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
that
such
an
agreement
should
be
void
just
as
this
court
held
the
boyd
agreement
was
void.
so
summing
up,
neither
of
the
two
exceptions
which
have
been
urged
here
by
the
petitioner,
namely
the
exception
based
upon
some
concept
of
disparity
of
bargaining
power
or
sophisticated
people,
or
the
fact
that
he
is
a
foreigner
who
chose
to
come
to
this
country
and
subject
himself
to
the
act,
can
hold
substance
either
under
the
language
of
section
29
(a)
or
under
14.
a
suggestion
has
been
made
that
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
a
10b-5
case.
that
this
is
something
very
simple
to
understand,
but
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
an
arbitration
agreement
requires
a
adjudication
of
this
matter
before
a
foreign
tribunal
or
it’s
a
virtual
certainty
that
there
will
be
unfamiliarity
with
this
act,
then
as
this
court
noted
in
bernhardt,
the
remission
of
this
case,
the
change
of
this
case
from
a
court
to
arbitration
would
have
a
very
definite
potential
for
affecting
the
underlying
substantive
right
to
recovery.
arbitration
is
not
simply
in
a
formal
matter,
a
procedural
matter.
this
court
held
it
in
bernhardt
under
the
--
under
an
eerie
question
really,
that
arbitration
versus
the
court
is
a
matter
of
substance,
and
can
affect
and
perhaps
even
destroy
the
plaintiff’s
right
to
recovery.
under
circumstances
where
the
power
of
review,
the
development
of
the
record,
the
lack
of
discovery,
the
lack
of
development
of
unknown
body
of
doctrine
for
the
guidance
of
the
public
and
all
the
other
infirmities
of
arbitration
mentioned
in
wilko
are
equally
applicable
here.
so,
under
the
circumstances
we
ask
this
court
to
follow
its
holding
in
wilko
not
to
overrule
that
case
because
neither
the
statute
nor
the
convention
or
any
other
judicial
authority
requires
or
permits
it,
and
to
affirm
the
judgments
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
of
the
district
court.
