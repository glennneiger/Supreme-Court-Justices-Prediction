mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
mr
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
view
the
case,
there
are
two
questions
involved
in
this
litigation.
the
first
is
whose
lawsuit
is
this
in
the
first
place?
is
it
the
railroad's
lawsuit
or
is
it
amoskeag's
lawsuit,
the
present
controlling
stockholder.
i
think
the
record
is
clear
and
i
will
highlight
it
in
just
a
moment
that
it
is
indeed
the
railroad's
lawsuit.
the
second
question
is
assuming
that
it
is
the
railroad's
lawsuit,
if
the
railroad
makes
a
substantial
recovery
in
the
lawsuit,
will
this
inure
to
the
benefit
of
its
present
controlling
stockholder
amoskeag
in
such
a
way
that
the
windfall
“that
amoskeag
may
enjoy
outweigh
the
benefits
of
permitting
the
railroad
to
right
the
wrongs
which
have
been
done.”
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
probably
i
believe
is
the
interest
which
the
first
circuit
found
would
benefit
from
this.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yes
sir,
i
think
the
record
well
illustrates
the
fact
that
the
present
owners
of
the
railroad
amoskeag
are
engaged
in
the
process
of
developing
a
northern
new
england
rail
system.
amoskeag
presently
owns
35%
of
maine
central
railroad
stock
which
is
held
in
voting
trust.
it
owns
99%
of
the
bangor
&
aroostook
stock.
it
is
the
largest
single
holder
of
the
first
mortgage
bonds
of
the
boston
&
maine
railroad
presently
in
re-organization.
what
amoskeag
is
trying
to
do,
subject
to
the
supervision
of
the
commission,
is
to
put
together
a
northern
new
england
system
which
i
suggest
at
least
on
the
face
of
it
solves
some
of
the
problems
of
the
railroads
by
unifying
a
number
of
short
carriers
to
build
into
the
larger
system
which
maybe
in
fact
coming
out
of
conrail.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
they
don't
have
any
legal
obligation.
i
can
say
this
to
this
court,
i
know
that
they
have
a
moral
obligation
and
i
believe
that
properly
supervised
by
the
district
court
within
midge
(ph)
of
the
decree
that
those
funds
could
be
available.
indeed
as
we
suggest
in
our
brief,
amoskeag
and
the
railroad
are
both
prepared
to
enter
into
some
kind
of
meaningful
order
by
a
district
court
should
there
be
a
recovery
in
this
case.
so
that
those
funds
could
be
used,
let's
say,
for
the
system
or
if
not
for
the
system,
to
be
put
into
maintenance
of
way
and
maintenance
of
equipment
to
build
a
stronger
railroad
which
can
better
serve
the
public.
true,
as
my
brother
states,
it
doesn't
look
as
though
the
bangor
&
aroostook
is
in
problems.
that
maybe
because
good
management
took
care
of
this
after
the
railroad
was
sold
and
i
think
if
you
look
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
on
the
report
of
the
bureau
of
accounts,
you
will
see
some
indication
of
the
beneficial
management
of
this
railroad.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
they
strongly
suggested
that
it
could
be
they
didn't
because
i
think
they
were
leaving
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
to
the
district
court
if
there
should
be
a
recovery.
our
brief
itself
as
i
said,
indicates
that
the
railroad
and
amoskeag
would
be
amenable
to
such
a
decree
because
the
main
family
is
interested
in
railroads.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
as
i
understand,
it
really
very
little
--
i
think
the
main
part
of
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
separate
identifiable
interest
of
the
public
in
the
railroad
as
contrasted
with
the
interest
of
only
it's
controlling
stockholder.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
that
is
supported
by
maine
law.
there
is
also
a
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
wells
beach
casino
which
states
in
affect
that
rule
23,
the
equivalent
of
rule
23
can
be
suspended
and
it
will
be
suspended
in
maine
in
order
to
allow
suits
where
they
are
equitable
considerations
involved
such
as
here.
so
i
believe
that
maine
law
is
as
strong
if
not
stronger
than
federal
law
in
allowing
this
case
based
on
the
wells
beach
casino
case.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
i
think
that
and
i
thought
a
lot
about
this.
i
think
that
i
would
have
to
say
to
you
that
if
it
were
mom
and
pop
corporation
or
a
widget
company
such
as
you
are
suggesting
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
in
no
circumstances
i
would
have
to
say
we
are
not
--
this
case
will
not
support
that
because
of
the
strong
public
interest
that
is
involved
with
the
railroad
and
probably
not
a
strong
public
interest
involved
with
a
widget
company.
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad
is
a
public
utility
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
maine.
it's
completely
regulated
as
a
utility.
it
is
completely
regulated
by
the
inter
state
commerce
commission.
we
are
dealing
with
a
--
it
seems
to
me
we
are
dealing
with
the
easiest
case
under
these
circumstances.
this
the
so
called
private
corporation
which
it
is,
but
this
is
the
private
corporation
which
is
probably
more
regulated
than
any
other
private
corporation,
why,
because
of
the
public
interest
in
this
corporation
and
it's
that
separate
identifiable
public
interest
which
the
first
circuit
found
gave
this
case
a
different
treatment.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
as
far
as
i
know
not
except
in
the
usual
course
which
is
that
they
can
in
para
capitals.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
there
is
no
other
regulation--
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
not
that
i
know
off
sir
under
maine
law.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
maine
law
and
federal
law
both
suggest
that
the
amount
that
can
be
earned
by
a
regulated
company
such
as
this
is
limited
by
the
amount
of
rates
that
they
can
charge
and
if
there
is
an
underlying
public
policy
that
you
ought
not
to
be
able
to
take
those
regulated
earnings
and
stick
them
up
stairs
and
have
them
produce
unregulated
earnings
for
you.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yes
sir.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yes
sir
very
much
so
and
we
tried
to
point
that
out
in
our
brief.
first
of
all,
i
say
that
the
federal
counts
we
are
talking
about
under
section
10
(b)
of
the
1934
act
and
under
the
antitrust
act,
clayton
act,
section
10
are
strong
indications
of
public
policies
which
should
be
vindicated
--
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yes
sir
and
i
think
that
the
use
of
rule
23
--
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yes
sir.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yes
sir.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
no
sir
it
was
not
suggested
as
to
those.
although,
i
believe
this
first
circuit
decision
rested
mainly
on
federal
counts.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
those
are
the
basically
counts
that
are
--
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yes
sir.
now
those
were
not
passed
upon,
but
i
believe
the
wells
--
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
as
to
those
--
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
as
to
those
counts
under
maine
law
for
convergence
and
violation
of
the
statue
under
maine
law,
by
possibly
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
asked
that,
but
i
think
again
we
are
getting
away
from
the
main
aspect
of
this
case
which
is
that
this
is
the
railroad
suing
to
right
the
wrongs
that
was
done
to
it.
when
we
start
talking
as
mr.
ryan
does
about
rule
23.1
and
about
standing
to
sue
before
this
court,
we
are
really
talking
about
second
question
that
i
said
i
would
address
myself
to
and
that
is
what
are
you
supposed
to
do
if
in
fact
a
windfall
inures
to
the
benefits
of
amoskeag
in
this
case
and
i
think
there
you
have
the
question
and
the
first
circuit
dealt
with
it
by
saying
that
there
was
a
public
interest
involved.
the
question
of
do
you
punish
the
wrong
doer
for
statutory
violations
of
federal
law
and
of
state
law
or
do
you
let
the
wrong
doer
go
scat
free
as
it
were
because
of
the
fact
that
there
maybe
a
windfall
to
the
present
controlling
stockholder.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yes
sir
the
present
innocent
controlling
stockholder
justice
white.
there
is
no
question
about
that
this
present
stockholder
didn't
participate
at
all
in
what
was
done
prior
to
the
time
amoskeag
acquired
its
stock.
the
home
fire
insurance
case
which
everybody
relies
upon
and
my
brother
relies
upon
in
opposition
to
this,
show
that
a
new
controlling
stockholder
who
had
received
the
benefit
of
his
stock
by
reason
the
wrong
doing
of
the
buyer
stockholder
couldn't
being
to
suit,
but
the
corporation
could
bring
this
to
suit
when
moneys
was
taken
illegally
from
it,
$3000
by
an
officer
and
the
court,
dean
pound
in
that
case
wasn't
worried
about
the
$3000
inuring
to
the
benefit
of
the
present
controlling
stockholder.
that's
why
we
think
home
fire
insurance
supports
us.
what
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
the
directors
of
this
corporation
had
before
them
in
the
july
of
1971,
a
report
from
the
bureau
of
accounts,
interstate
commerce
commission,
which
had
been
made
public.
and
that
had
said,
“we
recommend
that
all
legal
remedies
be
explored
to
require
the
holding
company
which
sold
the
carrier
to
pay
back
to
the
carrier
for
assets
taken,
with
no
compensation,
and
charges
made
where
no
services
were
performed”
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
they
point
out
in
their
brief
simply
couldn't
do
anything
of
about
this,
they
had
no
jurisdiction
over
one
railroad
holding
companies.
they
had
no
jurisdiction
over
the
transfer
of
assets,
from
one
corporate
affiliate
to
another.
so
if
a
director
of
the
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad
at
that
time
saw
that
statement
in
the
bureau
of
accounts
report
as
they
did,
in
july
of
1971,
what
were
they
supposed
to
do
to
discharge
their
fiduciary
duty.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
the
record
points
out
a
majority
of
the
board,
of
the
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad
in
july
of
1971
were
members
of
the
prior
board,
the
board
which
had
sat,
while
these
assets
where
being
taken
away
unbeknownst
to
them,
presumably
and
a
majority
of
that
number
actually
voted
to
bring
this
lawsuit.
so
it
was
not
a
case
where
amoskeag
walked
in,
changed
the
entire
board
of
directors
and
said
now,
let
see
what
we
can
do,
to
get
back
what
was
taken
out
of
this
corporation.
it
was
the
old
board
majority
that
authorized
the
bringing
of
this
suit.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
it
would
have
inured
to
the
benefit
of
the
corporation.
the
question
is
really
i
think,
would
it
have
been
enhanced
the
value
of
the
stock.
i
think
that
in
these
situations
where
you
are
making
sales,
as
we
tried
to
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
usual
question
is,
what
are
these
properties
worth
and
what
would
be
savings
that
will
be
accomplished
if
you
are
putting
railroads
together
or
flatten
out
the
earnings
projection
so
that
you
get
not
a
one
time
profit,
but
a
realization
of
what
the
railroad
on
a
day-to-day
base
is
worth.
so
yes,
possibly
it
might
have
enhanced
the
price
of
the
stock,
but
i
don't
think
really
as
much
as
it
does
in
normal
corporate
kind
of
arrangement,
i
think
the
railroad
situation
is
something
different
along
those
lines.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yeah,
that's
what
i
am
saying,
i
really
don't
know.
i
am
not
convinced
that
they
would
have
because
it
might
have
been
a
one
time
increase
in
earnings
which
would
be
so
called
leveled
out.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
i
think
icc
accounting,
it
may
have
to
be
treated
that
way,
but
as
you
are
speaking,
so
i
think
that
it
will
enhance
perhaps
the
value
of
the
assets.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yes
sir
it
would.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
that
would
have
some
effect
upon
what
they
--
i
wish
to
emphasize
incidentally
that
although
there
is
--
amoskeag
paid
five
million
for
the
stock
and
there
is
a
recovery
you
cited,
it's
not
seven
million
dollars,
that's
when
you
add
up
all
the
various
kinds
together.
it's
more
like
two
or
three
million
dollars
so
it
is
not
an
access
really
of
the
purchase
price.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
that's
what
i
am
not
clear
about
mr.
justice
burger.
perhaps
--
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
would
be
higher,
indeed
might
be,
and
probably
would.
so
that
the
question
now
is,
are
we
going
to
let
that
be
controlling
consideration
for
this
court
or
are
we
going
to
allow
the
corporation
itself
now
to
try
and
recover
for
the
wrongs,
which
were
done
upon
it
when
it
was
controlled
by
bangor
punta.
and
again
i
would
like
to
stress,
i
think
it's
the
public
interest
aspect
of
this
the
fact
that
this
railroad
is
a
highly
regulated
company,
which
gives
special
meaning,
in
this
circumstance
to
bringing
this
lawsuit.
now,
let's
assume
for
example,
that
the
one
percent
stockholders
now
ask
the
corporation
to
bring
a
derivative
action,
we
would
be
met
by
the
same
argument,
if
we
were
before
this
court
that
where
presently
met
with.
that
is
the
real
party
in
interest,
even
though
shareholder
here
has
asked
that
a
derivative
suit
be
brought,
the
real
party
in
interest
is
amoskeag
and
therefore
there
can't
be
any
recovery
beyond
the
one
percent,
based
on
the
headley
case.
we
suggest
to
this
court
that
headley
case
really
isn't
controlling
under
such
circumstances.
that
if
a
derivative
action
were
to
commence
now,
the
better
rule
would
be
to
allow
the
corporation
to
recover
fully,
for
what
have
been
done
against
it.
the
affective
going
with
judge
gnew
who
dismissed
the
entire
action,
is
that
nobody
will
ever
be
able
to
right
the
wrongs
here.
each
time
we'll
be
faced
with
the
rule
223.1
argument,
because
the
court
will
say,
pardon
me
mr.
ryan
in
effect
will
say
sorry
this
is
a
windfall
to
amoskeag.
the
headley
case
controls.
in
fact
it
seems
to
us
that
this
being
the
kind
of
corporation
that
it
is,
a
railroad
with
the
strong
public
interest,
that
shouldn't
be
the
case.
somebody
ought
to
be
able
to
recover
for
this.
i
think
basically
those
are
the
--
that
is
the
essence
of
the
case.
first,
that
this
is
unquestionably
the
railroad
suit.
it
was
brought
by
the
railroad's
directors
in
response
to
the
bureau
of
accounts.
the
icc
could
do
nothing
about
it.
bureau
of
accounts
report
said
that
the
directors
of
the
corporation
to
do
something
and
in
discharging
their
fiduciary
duties
a
lawsuit
was
commenced.
the
real
question
then,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
who
is
bringing
the
suit,
the
real
question
then
is,
is
the
windfall
argument
going
to
out
pace
the
argument
which
says
that
this
railroad
ought
to
be
able
to
right
the
wrongs
that
it
was
done
to
it.
we
earnestly
submit
to
this
court
that
the
answer
ought
to
be
allow
this
railroad
because
it
is
a
railroad
to
bring
this
lawsuit.
things
can
be
done
if
there
is
a
recovery
to
ensure
to
a
great
degree
that
any
recovery
will
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
the
public,
by
strengthening
the
railroad,
by
allowing
it
to
give
better
service
to
those
who
it
does
serve.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
mr
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
view
the
case,
there
are
two
questions
involved
in
this
litigation.
the
first
is
whose
lawsuit
is
this
in
the
first
place?
is
it
the
railroad's
lawsuit
or
is
it
amoskeag's
lawsuit,
the
present
controlling
stockholder.
i
think
the
record
is
clear
and
i
will
highlight
it
in
just
a
moment
that
it
is
indeed
the
railroad's
lawsuit.
the
second
question
is
assuming
that
it
is
the
railroad's
lawsuit,
if
the
railroad
makes
a
substantial
recovery
in
the
lawsuit,
will
this
inure
to
the
benefit
of
its
present
controlling
stockholder
amoskeag
in
such
a
way
that
the
windfall
“that
amoskeag
may
enjoy
outweigh
the
benefits
of
permitting
the
railroad
to
right
the
wrongs
which
have
been
done.”
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
probably
i
believe
is
the
interest
which
the
first
circuit
found
would
benefit
from
this.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yes
sir,
i
think
the
record
well
illustrates
the
fact
that
the
present
owners
of
the
railroad
amoskeag
are
engaged
in
the
process
of
developing
a
northern
new
england
rail
system.
amoskeag
presently
owns
35%
of
maine
central
railroad
stock
which
is
held
in
voting
trust.
it
owns
99%
of
the
bangor
&
aroostook
stock.
it
is
the
largest
single
holder
of
the
first
mortgage
bonds
of
the
boston
&
maine
railroad
presently
in
re-organization.
what
amoskeag
is
trying
to
do,
subject
to
the
supervision
of
the
commission,
is
to
put
together
a
northern
new
england
system
which
i
suggest
at
least
on
the
face
of
it
solves
some
of
the
problems
of
the
railroads
by
unifying
a
number
of
short
carriers
to
build
into
the
larger
system
which
maybe
in
fact
coming
out
of
conrail.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
they
don't
have
any
legal
obligation.
i
can
say
this
to
this
court,
i
know
that
they
have
a
moral
obligation
and
i
believe
that
properly
supervised
by
the
district
court
within
midge
(ph)
of
the
decree
that
those
funds
could
be
available.
indeed
as
we
suggest
in
our
brief,
amoskeag
and
the
railroad
are
both
prepared
to
enter
into
some
kind
of
meaningful
order
by
a
district
court
should
there
be
a
recovery
in
this
case.
so
that
those
funds
could
be
used,
let's
say,
for
the
system
or
if
not
for
the
system,
to
be
put
into
maintenance
of
way
and
maintenance
of
equipment
to
build
a
stronger
railroad
which
can
better
serve
the
public.
true,
as
my
brother
states,
it
doesn't
look
as
though
the
bangor
&
aroostook
is
in
problems.
that
maybe
because
good
management
took
care
of
this
after
the
railroad
was
sold
and
i
think
if
you
look
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
on
the
report
of
the
bureau
of
accounts,
you
will
see
some
indication
of
the
beneficial
management
of
this
railroad.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
they
strongly
suggested
that
it
could
be
they
didn't
because
i
think
they
were
leaving
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
to
the
district
court
if
there
should
be
a
recovery.
our
brief
itself
as
i
said,
indicates
that
the
railroad
and
amoskeag
would
be
amenable
to
such
a
decree
because
the
main
family
is
interested
in
railroads.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
as
i
understand,
it
really
very
little
--
i
think
the
main
part
of
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
separate
identifiable
interest
of
the
public
in
the
railroad
as
contrasted
with
the
interest
of
only
it's
controlling
stockholder.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
that
is
supported
by
maine
law.
there
is
also
a
case
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
wells
beach
casino
which
states
in
affect
that
rule
23,
the
equivalent
of
rule
23
can
be
suspended
and
it
will
be
suspended
in
maine
in
order
to
allow
suits
where
they
are
equitable
considerations
involved
such
as
here.
so
i
believe
that
maine
law
is
as
strong
if
not
stronger
than
federal
law
in
allowing
this
case
based
on
the
wells
beach
casino
case.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
i
think
that
and
i
thought
a
lot
about
this.
i
think
that
i
would
have
to
say
to
you
that
if
it
were
mom
and
pop
corporation
or
a
widget
company
such
as
you
are
suggesting
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
in
no
circumstances
i
would
have
to
say
we
are
not
--
this
case
will
not
support
that
because
of
the
strong
public
interest
that
is
involved
with
the
railroad
and
probably
not
a
strong
public
interest
involved
with
a
widget
company.
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad
is
a
public
utility
under
the
law
of
the
state
of
maine.
it's
completely
regulated
as
a
utility.
it
is
completely
regulated
by
the
inter
state
commerce
commission.
we
are
dealing
with
a
--
it
seems
to
me
we
are
dealing
with
the
easiest
case
under
these
circumstances.
this
the
so
called
private
corporation
which
it
is,
but
this
is
the
private
corporation
which
is
probably
more
regulated
than
any
other
private
corporation,
why,
because
of
the
public
interest
in
this
corporation
and
it's
that
separate
identifiable
public
interest
which
the
first
circuit
found
gave
this
case
a
different
treatment.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
as
far
as
i
know
not
except
in
the
usual
course
which
is
that
they
can
in
para
capitals.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
there
is
no
other
regulation--
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
not
that
i
know
off
sir
under
maine
law.
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
maine
law
and
federal
law
both
suggest
that
the
amount
that
can
be
earned
by
a
regulated
company
such
as
this
is
limited
by
the
amount
of
rates
that
they
can
charge
and
if
there
is
an
underlying
public
policy
that
you
ought
not
to
be
able
to
take
those
regulated
earnings
and
stick
them
up
stairs
and
have
them
produce
unregulated
earnings
for
you.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yes
sir.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yes
sir
very
much
so
and
we
tried
to
point
that
out
in
our
brief.
first
of
all,
i
say
that
the
federal
counts
we
are
talking
about
under
section
10
(b)
of
the
1934
act
and
under
the
antitrust
act,
clayton
act,
section
10
are
strong
indications
of
public
policies
which
should
be
vindicated
--
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yes
sir
and
i
think
that
the
use
of
rule
23
--
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yes
sir.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yes
sir.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
no
sir
it
was
not
suggested
as
to
those.
although,
i
believe
this
first
circuit
decision
rested
mainly
on
federal
counts.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
those
are
the
basically
counts
that
are
--
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yes
sir.
now
those
were
not
passed
upon,
but
i
believe
the
wells
--
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
as
to
those
--
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
as
to
those
counts
under
maine
law
for
convergence
and
violation
of
the
statue
under
maine
law,
by
possibly
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
asked
that,
but
i
think
again
we
are
getting
away
from
the
main
aspect
of
this
case
which
is
that
this
is
the
railroad
suing
to
right
the
wrongs
that
was
done
to
it.
when
we
start
talking
as
mr.
ryan
does
about
rule
23.1
and
about
standing
to
sue
before
this
court,
we
are
really
talking
about
second
question
that
i
said
i
would
address
myself
to
and
that
is
what
are
you
supposed
to
do
if
in
fact
a
windfall
inures
to
the
benefits
of
amoskeag
in
this
case
and
i
think
there
you
have
the
question
and
the
first
circuit
dealt
with
it
by
saying
that
there
was
a
public
interest
involved.
the
question
of
do
you
punish
the
wrong
doer
for
statutory
violations
of
federal
law
and
of
state
law
or
do
you
let
the
wrong
doer
go
scat
free
as
it
were
because
of
the
fact
that
there
maybe
a
windfall
to
the
present
controlling
stockholder.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yes
sir
the
present
innocent
controlling
stockholder
justice
white.
there
is
no
question
about
that
this
present
stockholder
didn't
participate
at
all
in
what
was
done
prior
to
the
time
amoskeag
acquired
its
stock.
the
home
fire
insurance
case
which
everybody
relies
upon
and
my
brother
relies
upon
in
opposition
to
this,
show
that
a
new
controlling
stockholder
who
had
received
the
benefit
of
his
stock
by
reason
the
wrong
doing
of
the
buyer
stockholder
couldn't
being
to
suit,
but
the
corporation
could
bring
this
to
suit
when
moneys
was
taken
illegally
from
it,
$3000
by
an
officer
and
the
court,
dean
pound
in
that
case
wasn't
worried
about
the
$3000
inuring
to
the
benefit
of
the
present
controlling
stockholder.
that's
why
we
think
home
fire
insurance
supports
us.
what
i
would
like
to
point
out
is
the
directors
of
this
corporation
had
before
them
in
the
july
of
1971,
a
report
from
the
bureau
of
accounts,
interstate
commerce
commission,
which
had
been
made
public.
and
that
had
said,
“we
recommend
that
all
legal
remedies
be
explored
to
require
the
holding
company
which
sold
the
carrier
to
pay
back
to
the
carrier
for
assets
taken,
with
no
compensation,
and
charges
made
where
no
services
were
performed”
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission
as
they
point
out
in
their
brief
simply
couldn't
do
anything
of
about
this,
they
had
no
jurisdiction
over
one
railroad
holding
companies.
they
had
no
jurisdiction
over
the
transfer
of
assets,
from
one
corporate
affiliate
to
another.
so
if
a
director
of
the
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad
at
that
time
saw
that
statement
in
the
bureau
of
accounts
report
as
they
did,
in
july
of
1971,
what
were
they
supposed
to
do
to
discharge
their
fiduciary
duty.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
the
record
points
out
a
majority
of
the
board,
of
the
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad
in
july
of
1971
were
members
of
the
prior
board,
the
board
which
had
sat,
while
these
assets
where
being
taken
away
unbeknownst
to
them,
presumably
and
a
majority
of
that
number
actually
voted
to
bring
this
lawsuit.
so
it
was
not
a
case
where
amoskeag
walked
in,
changed
the
entire
board
of
directors
and
said
now,
let
see
what
we
can
do,
to
get
back
what
was
taken
out
of
this
corporation.
it
was
the
old
board
majority
that
authorized
the
bringing
of
this
suit.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
it
would
have
inured
to
the
benefit
of
the
corporation.
the
question
is
really
i
think,
would
it
have
been
enhanced
the
value
of
the
stock.
i
think
that
in
these
situations
where
you
are
making
sales,
as
we
tried
to
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
usual
question
is,
what
are
these
properties
worth
and
what
would
be
savings
that
will
be
accomplished
if
you
are
putting
railroads
together
or
flatten
out
the
earnings
projection
so
that
you
get
not
a
one
time
profit,
but
a
realization
of
what
the
railroad
on
a
day-to-day
base
is
worth.
so
yes,
possibly
it
might
have
enhanced
the
price
of
the
stock,
but
i
don't
think
really
as
much
as
it
does
in
normal
corporate
kind
of
arrangement,
i
think
the
railroad
situation
is
something
different
along
those
lines.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yeah,
that's
what
i
am
saying,
i
really
don't
know.
i
am
not
convinced
that
they
would
have
because
it
might
have
been
a
one
time
increase
in
earnings
which
would
be
so
called
leveled
out.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
i
think
icc
accounting,
it
may
have
to
be
treated
that
way,
but
as
you
are
speaking,
so
i
think
that
it
will
enhance
perhaps
the
value
of
the
assets.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yes
sir
it
would.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
that
would
have
some
effect
upon
what
they
--
i
wish
to
emphasize
incidentally
that
although
there
is
--
amoskeag
paid
five
million
for
the
stock
and
there
is
a
recovery
you
cited,
it's
not
seven
million
dollars,
that's
when
you
add
up
all
the
various
kinds
together.
it's
more
like
two
or
three
million
dollars
so
it
is
not
an
access
really
of
the
purchase
price.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
that's
what
i
am
not
clear
about
mr.
justice
burger.
perhaps
--
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
alan
l.
lefkowitz
would
be
higher,
indeed
might
be,
and
probably
would.
so
that
the
question
now
is,
are
we
going
to
let
that
be
controlling
consideration
for
this
court
or
are
we
going
to
allow
the
corporation
itself
now
to
try
and
recover
for
the
wrongs,
which
were
done
upon
it
when
it
was
controlled
by
bangor
punta.
and
again
i
would
like
to
stress,
i
think
it's
the
public
interest
aspect
of
this
the
fact
that
this
railroad
is
a
highly
regulated
company,
which
gives
special
meaning,
in
this
circumstance
to
bringing
this
lawsuit.
now,
let's
assume
for
example,
that
the
one
percent
stockholders
now
ask
the
corporation
to
bring
a
derivative
action,
we
would
be
met
by
the
same
argument,
if
we
were
before
this
court
that
where
presently
met
with.
that
is
the
real
party
in
interest,
even
though
shareholder
here
has
asked
that
a
derivative
suit
be
brought,
the
real
party
in
interest
is
amoskeag
and
therefore
there
can't
be
any
recovery
beyond
the
one
percent,
based
on
the
headley
case.
we
suggest
to
this
court
that
headley
case
really
isn't
controlling
under
such
circumstances.
that
if
a
derivative
action
were
to
commence
now,
the
better
rule
would
be
to
allow
the
corporation
to
recover
fully,
for
what
have
been
done
against
it.
the
affective
going
with
judge
gnew
who
dismissed
the
entire
action,
is
that
nobody
will
ever
be
able
to
right
the
wrongs
here.
each
time
we'll
be
faced
with
the
rule
223.1
argument,
because
the
court
will
say,
pardon
me
mr.
ryan
in
effect
will
say
sorry
this
is
a
windfall
to
amoskeag.
the
headley
case
controls.
in
fact
it
seems
to
us
that
this
being
the
kind
of
corporation
that
it
is,
a
railroad
with
the
strong
public
interest,
that
shouldn't
be
the
case.
somebody
ought
to
be
able
to
recover
for
this.
i
think
basically
those
are
the
--
that
is
the
essence
of
the
case.
first,
that
this
is
unquestionably
the
railroad
suit.
it
was
brought
by
the
railroad's
directors
in
response
to
the
bureau
of
accounts.
the
icc
could
do
nothing
about
it.
bureau
of
accounts
report
said
that
the
directors
of
the
corporation
to
do
something
and
in
discharging
their
fiduciary
duties
a
lawsuit
was
commenced.
the
real
question
then,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
who
is
bringing
the
suit,
the
real
question
then
is,
is
the
windfall
argument
going
to
out
pace
the
argument
which
says
that
this
railroad
ought
to
be
able
to
right
the
wrongs
that
it
was
done
to
it.
we
earnestly
submit
to
this
court
that
the
answer
ought
to
be
allow
this
railroad
because
it
is
a
railroad
to
bring
this
lawsuit.
things
can
be
done
if
there
is
a
recovery
to
ensure
to
a
great
degree
that
any
recovery
will
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
the
public,
by
strengthening
the
railroad,
by
allowing
it
to
give
better
service
to
those
who
it
does
serve.
thank
you
very
much.
