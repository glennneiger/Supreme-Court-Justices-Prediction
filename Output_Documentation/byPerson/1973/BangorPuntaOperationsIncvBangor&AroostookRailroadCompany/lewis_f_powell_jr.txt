justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
it
involves
an
action
my
maine
railroad
corporation
seeking
damages
from
its
former
owner
bangor
punta
cooperation
for
alleged
acts
of
corporate
mismanagement,
acts
which
took
place
during
the
period
in
which
bangor
punta
controlled
the
railroad.
amoskeag
co.
which
now
controls
the
railroad
purchased
98%
of
its
shares
from
bangor
punta,
long
before
the
alleged
wrongs
occurred.
amoskeag
then
caused
this
action
to
be
brought
and
as
they
are
98%
share
holder,
it
would
be
the
major
beneficiary
of
any
recovery.
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
favor
of
amoskeag,
primary
on
the
ground
that
any
recovery
by
the
railroad
would
ultimately
benefit
the
public
through
improved
services.
but
amoskeag
alleges
no
fraud
in
the
purchase
transaction
and
it
has
suffered
no
injury
or
breach
of
any
legal
duty
owed
it
yet.
we
hold
that
under
traditional
principles
of
equity,
amoskeag
is
not
entitled
to
a
windfall
recovery
under
these
circumstances.
accordingly
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
douglas,
brennan
and
white
have
joined.
