mr.
ryan,
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
someone
has
removed
assets
from
the
corporation
illegally,
and
has
assets
to
the
corporation
that
he
has
converted
to
his
own
use.
what
real
reason
is
there
to
prefer
him
do
the
corporation
and
his
new
owner
when
a
suit
is
brought
to
recover
those
illegally
converted
assets?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
as
windfall,
but
so
that
may
be,
but
if
the
assets
are
not
recovered
it's
a
windfall
to
a
wrong
doer?
justice
byron
r.
white
conceding
the
windfall,
mr.
ryan?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
could
you
do
with
all
the
assets
that
have
been
illegally
converted,
leave
them
with
them
the
wrong
doer?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
what
the
lawsuit
is
all
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
corporation
--
the
corporation
normally
represents
all
the
people
who
are
interested
as
a
corporation,
and
that
one
percent
would
certainly
benefit
if
the
corporation
recovered
these
illegally
converted
assets
if
they
have
been
illegally
converted,
but
that
is
what
the
lawsuit
is
all
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
just
arguing
again
that
it
is
a
windfall,
and
i
am
asking
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
asking
why
prefer
the
wrong
doer
to
someone
who
might
receive
windfall
--
an
innocent
party
might
receive
a
windfall?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
take
it
you
would
have
the
same
--
you
would
have
the
same
--
take
the
same
position
if
there
have
been
a
100
stockholders
of
the
old
corporation
and
then
there
had
been
mismanagement
and
alleged
conversion
of
assets
and
then
a
100
all
sold-out
to
amoskeag?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
my
question
now?
let
us
assume
a
100
stockholders
but
now
there
is
only
one,
and
he
is
suing
for
a
wrong
that
was
done
when
he
was
not
a
stockholder,
but
there
used
to
be
a
100
when
the
wrong
was
done,
now
what
about
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
critical
part
of
your
position
i
take
it
that
not
only
is
their
sole
stockholder
now,
who
did
not
own
a
stock
when
the
wrong
was
done,
but
there
was
a
sole,
in
effect
a
sole
stockholder
when
the
wrong
was
done?
