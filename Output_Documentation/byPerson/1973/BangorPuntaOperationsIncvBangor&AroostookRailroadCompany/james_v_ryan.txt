mr.
james
v.
ryan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
first
circuit.
i
represent
the
petitioner
defendants
bangor
putna
corporation
and
its
wholly
owned
subsidiary.
bangor
putna
is
a
publicly
owned,
manufacturing
concern.
the
respondent
plaintiffs
are
the
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad
and
its
wholly
on
subsidiary.
the
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad
operates
the
railroad.
it's
trackage
is
exclusively
within
the
state
of
maine.
the
issue
before
this
court
to
day
is
may
uninjured
party,
by
using
the
device
of
the
cooperate
form
while
claiming
to
vindicate
an
inchoate
public
interest
maintain
an
action
in
the
federal
court.
now
this
action
was
commence
by
the
filing
of
a
complaint
in
the
district
court
in
maine
in
december
of
1971.
although,
the
complaint
contains
13
causes
of
action,
allegedly
based
on
violations
of
the
securities
laws,
the
antitrust
laws,
maine
statutes
and
the
common
law,
essentially
its
based
upon
four
inter
company
transactions
which
occurred
between
bangor
punta
the
petitioner
here
and
the
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad,
the
nominal
plaintiff
here
while
bangor
punta
--
while
the
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad
was
a
98%
owned
subsidiary
of
bangor
punta.
although,
the
claims
as
i
say
allege
various
violation
of
federal
statutes,
as
judge
gnew
(ph)
and
the
district
court
has
stated
or
properly
characterized
them,
they
are
claims
which
are
typical
stockholders
claims,
seeking
and
accounting
for
alleged
misappropriation
and
waste
of
cooperate
assets
by
controlling
shareholders.
now
after
the
filing
of
the
complaint
and
the
filing
of
the
answer,
the
petitioner
bangor
punta
moved
for
summary
judgment,
based
upon
the
admissions
in
the
complaint.
the
district
court
on
settled
principles
of
law
granted
the
motion
and
held
that
the
nominal
plaintiff
here,
the
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad
company
and
the
real
party
in
interest
here
amoskeag
corporation
which
purchase
the
99%
owned
interest
of
bangor
punta
and
the
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad
are
barred
from
maintaining
this
action.
on
appeal
to
the
first
circuit,
this
decision
was
unanimously
reversed.
although
the
first
circuit
agreed
with
the
district
court
and
said
that
these
are
essentially
stockholders'
claims
and
in
a
normal
corporate
situation,
a
dismissal
would
have
been
proper
in
this
case
because
a
railroad
was
involved
which
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
as
being
a
public
corporation,
a
separate
inchoate
undefined
interest
of
the
public
was
involved.
this
interest
of
the
public
which
was
held
and
stated
to
be
an
interest
in
the
financial
health
of
the
bar
provided
a
legally
recognizable
and
separate
interest
which
was
served
by
this
action.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
yes
sir.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
yes
sir.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
yes
sir
and
the
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
no
not
at
holding
the
court
of
appeals
do
not
know
sir,
no
excuse
me
i
misunderstood
your
complaint,
your
question.
no
the
maine
court
said
that
this
action
could
be
maintained
even
the
state
court,
actually
a
state
court
claims
because
of
this
separable
interest
and
there
is
no
maine
law
which
supports
that
proposition.
as
judge
of
gnew
noted
his
opinion
bar
did
not
claim
in
its
complaint
that
there
was
any
public
interest
or
any
rights
of
any
creditor
is
involved
in
this
action.
nor
did
the
bar
before
the
court
of
appeals
had
indicated
that
they
were
suing
vindicate
any
specific
public
interest.
even
before
to
this
court,
they
do
not
allege
or
state
that
they
are
vindicating
any
specific
public
interest.
what
they
say
is,
is
that
a
railroad
is
a
public
asset
and
because
a
railroad
is
a
public
asset
the
normal
rules
of
law
do
not
apply
to
this
situation
in
this
case.
now
the
facts
are
simple.
in
1960
the
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad
corporation
caused
the
predecessor
and
interest
of
bangor
punta
to
be
formed
and
then
by
a
registered
exchange
offer
the
shareholders
of
the
railroad
became
the
shareholders
of
the
parent
company.
this
was
the
holding
company
trend
which
was
the
vogue
in
railroads
during
the
late
50s
and
early
60s.
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
transaction,
the
railroad
became
a
99%
subsidiary
of
the
parent
holding
company.
the
actions
on
which
the
complaint
are
based
and
which
complaint
claims
are
unlawful,
all
occurred
between
1960
and
1967
and
as
judge
of
gnew
stated
they
are
essentially
claims
of
corporate
place,
that
a
controlling
shareholder
mismanaged
the
assets
of
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary.
now
on
october
2,
1969
the
bangor
punta
sold
its
99%
interest
in
the
bar
to
amoskeag
which
is
again
a
public
corporation
with
public
stockholders
the
interest
in
the
railroad
for
five
million
dollars
in
cash
and
december
of
1971
this
law
suite
was
started.
now
as
the
district
court
pointed
out
there
are
three
flaws
really
controlling
facts
which
are
dispositive
of
this
case.
first
of
all
the
real
party
here,
the
real
party
in
interest
is
amoskeag.
amoskeag
owns
99%
of
this
railroad
and
they
are
not
claiming
to
be
suing
to
vindicate
the
seven-tenths
of
1%
of
private
shareholders,
number
one.
number
two,
amoskeag
does
not
claim
that
it
was
defrauded
or
it
was
misled
by
anything
that
bangor
punta
stated,
or
that
is
got
less
than
it
paid.
amoskeag
purchased
the
stock
from
the
wrong
doer,
alleged
wrong
doer
after
the
acts
occurred
and
does
not
state
that
it
suffered
any
specific
injury.
what
it
is
attempting
to
do
by
this
action
is
obtain
a
windfall.
it
is
up
to
--
it
is
suing
to
recover
its
purchase
price
of
five
million
dollars
plus
an
additional
two
million
dollars
windfall
and
still
keep
the
railroad
and
yet
it
doesn't
state
that
it
was
injured.
now
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
generally
that
is
so.
a
corporation
is
a
legal
person
for
purposes
of
maintaining
suits
owning
property
and
we
are
doing
various
acts,
however,
in
this
case
here
the
claims
are
essentially
stockholder
claims,
essentially
equitable
claims
and
if
you
do
not
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
well,
it's
difficult
for
me
to
understand
how
one
can
say
that
a
99%
shareholder
or
affect
you
can
violate
rules
of
law
regarding
a
subsidiary
person
strictly
injured.
in
another
words
if
they
were
a
creditor
to
here
or
if
there
was
some
other
person
who
claims
injury
then
i
would
say
that
you
can't
look
behind
the
corporate
wall,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
correct
exactly
because
so
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
the
seven-tenths
of
1%,
you
see
bangor
punta
owned
in
affect
99%.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
no
sir.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
it
could
be
the
same,
it
could
be
different
depending
upon
the
facts.
i
do
not
think
you
can
make
a
categorical
statement
that
the
result
would
be
the
same.
i
may
want
to
think
in
this
specific
case,
your
honor,
it
would
be
the
same.
it
would
be
like
matthews
versus
headley
case
which
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
where
you
can
by
--
there
is
no
question
here
that
if
there
is
a
recovery
here
of
the
seven
million
dollars
that
amoskeag
has
received
a
windfall.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
it
could,
if
they
acquired
their
stock
after
the
events,
they
would
have
the
same
disability
that
amoskeag
would
have,
but
i
assumed
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
that
is
right.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
oh!
absolutely.
certainly.
certainly
right.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
that's
correct.
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
it
could.
it
would
depend
upon
what
the
result
would
be
when
they
are
framing
the
relief.
if
the
relief
would
result
in
what
is
characterized
in
the
the
case
as
an
unjustified
windfall
well
then
a
court
of
equity
in
derivative
action
would
be
able
to
be
frame
decree
accordingly.
it
will
depend
upon
the
facts
of
this
specific
case.
i
don't
think
you
can
make
a
blanket
rule,
but
certainly
in
this
case
where
you
have
99%
there
is
no
question
that
there
is
a
windfall
here
and
there
is
a
no
question
that
a
court
a
frame
a
decree
in
this
case.
now
as
i
say
that
if
you
eliminate
the
public
interest
or
claimed
public
interest
which
i'll
deal
with
next
then
it
seems
that
the
reasoning
of
judge
gnew
which
was
really
agreed
to
by
the
first
circuit
that
in
the
ordinary
corporate
case
the
dismissal
of
judge
gnew
would
have
been
sustained.
rule
23.1
would
have
been
prevented
amoskeag
from
suing
itself
and
that
the
general
equitable
principles
prevent
amoskeag
through
the
guise
of
the
corporate
form
to
maintain
this
action
on
behalf
of
itself.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
only
if
amoskeag
sued.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
that
is
correct.
now
i
am
not
--
i
don't
have
to
address
myself
to
that
point.
i
would
have
to
say
i
do
think
it
would,
but
i
don't
--
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
point
in
this
case
because
in
this
case
you
have
amoskeag
standing
here
who
is
the
real
party
of
interest,
alleging
essentially
equitable
claims
and
just
a
court
should
not
permit
amoskeag
to
be
unjustly
enriched
by
using
the
device
of
the
corporate
form
unless
there
is
a
some
other
public
interest
involved.
now
what
is
this
public
interest
which
is
where
the
first
circuit
departed
from
judge
gnew.
the
first
circuit
says
that
there
is
not
easily
defined
a
point
applies
inchoate
interest
in
the
public,
in
the
financial
health
of
railroads
and
that
this
interest
is
the
basis
for
maintaining
this
action.
the
respondents
go
even
further
and
they
say
that
a
railroad
is
a
public
asset.
well
your
honor,
we
submit
that
a
railroad
is
a
private
business
corporation
with
certain
clearly
defined
public
duties
and
obligations.
the
interstate
commerce
--
congress
through
the
interstate
commerce
act
in
various
legislations
over
the
last
50
or
60
years
has
clearly
defined
those
areas
in
which
there
are
the
interest
of
the
public
are
covered
and
there
is
also
some
residual
minor
common
law
responsibilities
of
railroads.
there
is
no
claim
in
this
complaint
or
anywhere
they
raise
that
bangor
punta
violated
any
of
these
statuary
rules
or
regulations
regarding
railroads.
on
the
contrary,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
acknowledges
that
there
is
apparently
a
gap
in
this
regulation
and
this
gap
is
what
they
are
asking
this
court
to
really
rectify
the
cure.
now
this
gap,
what
i
this
gap?
this
gap
is
that
is
that
a
holding
company
in
the
late
50's
and
early
60's
holding
companies
were
formed
and
operated
subsidiary
railroads
as
wholly
owned
subsidiaries
and
this
of
course
everybody
is
familiar
with
penn
central
that
was
not
a
very
successful,
but
we
had
other
successful
one
union
specific,
just
as
there
are
number
of
network
out.
now
first
of
all
in
this
case
there
is
no
allegation
in
this
complaint
that
the
bangor
&
aroostook
can
barely
survive.
on
the
contrary
the
bangor
&
aroostook
is
a
viable
railroad.
it
is
earning
money,
it
is
paying
dividends,
it
is
paying
off
its
debts.
it
is
one
of
the
only
railroads
in
the
north-east
that
really,
probably
east
of
the
mississippi
other
than
the
chesapeake
(ph)
that
is
still
paying
dividends.
so
it's
hardly
a
railroad
which
has
suffered
the
deprivations
of
a
pirate
who
has
looted
it.
secondly,
over
the
last
60
years,
congress
has
repeatedly
addressed
to
itself
to
railroads'
operation,
public
interest
in
railroad.
it
has
provided
a
numerous
remedies
not
only
by
administrative
but
also
by
private
actions.
the
legislators
of
course
do
not
indemnify
somebody
who
can
he
has
been
injured
under
one
of
the
statuary
requirements
and
this
is
not
covered
as
it's
conceded
by
the
icc
and
by
the
respondents.
now
is
it
for
this
court
to
create
this
remedy?
we
say
no.
this
--
the
railroad
is
a
regulated
industry,
highly
regulated
industry
and
it
should
not
be
for
a
court
to
provide
new
remedies
beyond
what
congress
says
are
really
in
the
public
interest.
but
thirdly,
and
more
importantly
this
very
and
i
will
call
it
a
problem
of
parents,
parent
companies,
holding
companies
with
subsidiary
railroads
has
been
the
subject
of
congressional
hearings
and
there
are
presently
pending
legislation
in
congress
which
addresses
itself
to
this
problem.
now
should
this
court
step
forward
and
go
ahead
of
congress?
congress
has
this
very
problem
before
it.
now
it's
interesting
to
note
that
even
with
the
legislation
in
front
of
congress
which
has
been
there
for
four
years
and
has
not
been
enacted,
so
perhaps
this
problem
of
holding
companies
is
not
quite
as
severe
or
as
evil
as
some
people
would
like
to
pretend,
they
have
enacted.
this
specific
legislation
doesn't
even
cover
our
situation
here
because
the
legislation
provides
that
the
before
the
icc
can
intervene
the
service
to
the
public
in
maine
from
the
bar
has
to
be
tracking
and
there
is
no
allegation
here
and
there
can
be
no
allegation
here
that
anything
that
my
client
did
threatened
the
public
service.
so
that
when
you
come
all
away
back
down
to
what
really
on
the
bottom
line
is
that
there
really
isn't
an
identifiable
public
interest
which
can
be
injured,
which
can
give
rise
to
jurisdiction
or
standing
in
a
federal
court.
now,
when
you
get
past
that
point
you
come
to
the
really
--
the
really
bottom
line
is
that
amoskeag
here
has
not
been
injured.
it
has
not
suffered
any
injury.
if
this
general
public
somewhere
that
may
have
suffered
an
injury,
but
it
has
not
suffered
an
injury.
it
is
not
a
proper
party,
plaintiff.
someone
out
there
may
be
able
to
maintain
an
action,
but
it
is
not
the
amoskeag
through
the
device
of
the
corporate
form.
now
they
argue,
your
honor,
that
well
they
can
frame
a
decree
and
that
there
is
a
recovery
here
that
is
going
to
be
some
public
benefit
because
some
of
the
money
might
stick
in
the
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad.
well
of
course
that
is
really
as
court
of
appeals
recognized
is
really
can
be
done.
it's
absurd,
cash
is
fungible.
you
put
cash
into
a
corporation,
it
can
come
out
at
the
other
end
in
all
kinds
of
ways
as
long
as
it's
solvent.
if
it
is
solvent
it
can
legally
as
any
business
corporation
pay
dividends
and
until
somebody
says
a
solvent
corporation
can't
pay
dividends
then
how
are
you
going
stop
the
money
from
coming
out.
true
you
could
probably
put
a
district
judge
in
there
to
run
this
railroad
for
20
years
and
somehow
put
all
the
stops
in,
but
that's
certainly
not
something
that
a
court
should
do,
particularly
when
the
railroad
is
solvent.
for
that
reason,
your
honor,
we
feel
this
case
should
be
(inaudible).
mr.
james
v.
ryan
just
two
points;
mr.
justice
brennan
on
the
question
as
to
whether
a
certification
would
have
been
required
here.
in
point
four
of
our
reply
brief,
we
point
out
that
under
the
law
of
maine,
there
is
no
substantive
right
here.
that
it's
been
abridged,
that
under
the
law,
that
if
the
this
was
the
suit
in
maine
the
hyams
case
would
have
controlled
the
results.
so
there
is
no
need
to
have
a
certification
as
you
suggest
the
law
on
that
aspect
that
maine
state
law
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
i
address
your
attention
to
the
point
four,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
well,
i
think
you
use
any
windfall
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
well,
i
know
why
are
the
--
the
person
who
practice
the
corporation,
purchases
the
balance
sheet,
and
a
balance
sheet
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
the
party
is
an
uninjured
party
and
if
you
are
going
to
permit
uninjured
parties
to
maintain
action
to
recover
alleged
deprivations
of
assets,
well
then
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
i
don't
--
i
think
it's
you
can't
say
they
have
been
illegally
converted.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
well,
assume
that
they
are
illegally
converted
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
i
say
that,
there
maybe
people
who
could
maintain
the
action.
in
this
case
the
one
percent,
assuming
there
was
some
real
property
subject
to
one
percent
could
maintain
the
action
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
that
is
quite
true,
but
i
think
when
you
look
at
this
corporation,
you
look
at
what?
you
look
at
really
amoskeag?
that
is
what's
standing
there,
not
the
corporate
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
essentially
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
well,
the
only
way
i
guess,
i
could
answer
that
if
you
are
going
to
permit
that
type
of
a
situation,
then
you
are
going
to
have
a
lot
of
people
going
around
bringing
lawsuits,
who
haven't
been
injured,
but
are
going
to
re-rectifying
wrongs
and
you
know,
if
you
are
going
to
find
a
lot
people
who
are
going
to
be
able
--
who
are
going
to
want
to
go
around
and
sue
for
$5,000,000
and
they
haven't
been
injured.
now
they
claim,
they
buy
a
corporate
share
and
they
do
a
lot
of
things.
what
you
are
in
effect
saying
is
your
honor
is
that
we
should
permit
bounty
hunters.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
then,
you
are
changing
it.
here
you
have
bangor
punta
is
the
one
who
has
supposedly
have
stolen
all
the
assets.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
i
think
you
would
have
to
evaluate
each
transaction.
i
mean,
if
the
party
was
defrauded,
he
would
have
certain
remedies,
if
he
were
injured,
he
would
have
certain
remedies.
this
one
of
the
100
who
could
maintain
action,
actions
under
the
securities
law,
actions
under
the
common
law,
but
that
is
not
this
situation
because
the
person
who
was
injured,
mr
justice
white,
was
bangor
punta,
it
took
its
own
assets
and
if
you
left
the
assets
then,
as
mr
chief
justice
said
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
i
think
that
there
is
no
injured
party
before
the
court.
now
whether
you
have
one
or
whether
you
have
a
hundred,
i
think
the
basic
proposition
is
that
amoskeag
was
not
injured
and
if
there
was
anybody
who
was
injured
it
was
bangor
punta.
i
keep
coming
back,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
first
circuit.
i
represent
the
petitioner
defendants
bangor
putna
corporation
and
its
wholly
owned
subsidiary.
bangor
putna
is
a
publicly
owned,
manufacturing
concern.
the
respondent
plaintiffs
are
the
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad
and
its
wholly
on
subsidiary.
the
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad
operates
the
railroad.
it's
trackage
is
exclusively
within
the
state
of
maine.
the
issue
before
this
court
to
day
is
may
uninjured
party,
by
using
the
device
of
the
cooperate
form
while
claiming
to
vindicate
an
inchoate
public
interest
maintain
an
action
in
the
federal
court.
now
this
action
was
commence
by
the
filing
of
a
complaint
in
the
district
court
in
maine
in
december
of
1971.
although,
the
complaint
contains
13
causes
of
action,
allegedly
based
on
violations
of
the
securities
laws,
the
antitrust
laws,
maine
statutes
and
the
common
law,
essentially
its
based
upon
four
inter
company
transactions
which
occurred
between
bangor
punta
the
petitioner
here
and
the
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad,
the
nominal
plaintiff
here
while
bangor
punta
--
while
the
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad
was
a
98%
owned
subsidiary
of
bangor
punta.
although,
the
claims
as
i
say
allege
various
violation
of
federal
statutes,
as
judge
gnew
(ph)
and
the
district
court
has
stated
or
properly
characterized
them,
they
are
claims
which
are
typical
stockholders
claims,
seeking
and
accounting
for
alleged
misappropriation
and
waste
of
cooperate
assets
by
controlling
shareholders.
now
after
the
filing
of
the
complaint
and
the
filing
of
the
answer,
the
petitioner
bangor
punta
moved
for
summary
judgment,
based
upon
the
admissions
in
the
complaint.
the
district
court
on
settled
principles
of
law
granted
the
motion
and
held
that
the
nominal
plaintiff
here,
the
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad
company
and
the
real
party
in
interest
here
amoskeag
corporation
which
purchase
the
99%
owned
interest
of
bangor
punta
and
the
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad
are
barred
from
maintaining
this
action.
on
appeal
to
the
first
circuit,
this
decision
was
unanimously
reversed.
although
the
first
circuit
agreed
with
the
district
court
and
said
that
these
are
essentially
stockholders'
claims
and
in
a
normal
corporate
situation,
a
dismissal
would
have
been
proper
in
this
case
because
a
railroad
was
involved
which
the
court
of
appeals
characterized
as
being
a
public
corporation,
a
separate
inchoate
undefined
interest
of
the
public
was
involved.
this
interest
of
the
public
which
was
held
and
stated
to
be
an
interest
in
the
financial
health
of
the
bar
provided
a
legally
recognizable
and
separate
interest
which
was
served
by
this
action.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
yes
sir.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
yes
sir.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
yes
sir
and
the
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
no
not
at
holding
the
court
of
appeals
do
not
know
sir,
no
excuse
me
i
misunderstood
your
complaint,
your
question.
no
the
maine
court
said
that
this
action
could
be
maintained
even
the
state
court,
actually
a
state
court
claims
because
of
this
separable
interest
and
there
is
no
maine
law
which
supports
that
proposition.
as
judge
of
gnew
noted
his
opinion
bar
did
not
claim
in
its
complaint
that
there
was
any
public
interest
or
any
rights
of
any
creditor
is
involved
in
this
action.
nor
did
the
bar
before
the
court
of
appeals
had
indicated
that
they
were
suing
vindicate
any
specific
public
interest.
even
before
to
this
court,
they
do
not
allege
or
state
that
they
are
vindicating
any
specific
public
interest.
what
they
say
is,
is
that
a
railroad
is
a
public
asset
and
because
a
railroad
is
a
public
asset
the
normal
rules
of
law
do
not
apply
to
this
situation
in
this
case.
now
the
facts
are
simple.
in
1960
the
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad
corporation
caused
the
predecessor
and
interest
of
bangor
punta
to
be
formed
and
then
by
a
registered
exchange
offer
the
shareholders
of
the
railroad
became
the
shareholders
of
the
parent
company.
this
was
the
holding
company
trend
which
was
the
vogue
in
railroads
during
the
late
50s
and
early
60s.
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
transaction,
the
railroad
became
a
99%
subsidiary
of
the
parent
holding
company.
the
actions
on
which
the
complaint
are
based
and
which
complaint
claims
are
unlawful,
all
occurred
between
1960
and
1967
and
as
judge
of
gnew
stated
they
are
essentially
claims
of
corporate
place,
that
a
controlling
shareholder
mismanaged
the
assets
of
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary.
now
on
october
2,
1969
the
bangor
punta
sold
its
99%
interest
in
the
bar
to
amoskeag
which
is
again
a
public
corporation
with
public
stockholders
the
interest
in
the
railroad
for
five
million
dollars
in
cash
and
december
of
1971
this
law
suite
was
started.
now
as
the
district
court
pointed
out
there
are
three
flaws
really
controlling
facts
which
are
dispositive
of
this
case.
first
of
all
the
real
party
here,
the
real
party
in
interest
is
amoskeag.
amoskeag
owns
99%
of
this
railroad
and
they
are
not
claiming
to
be
suing
to
vindicate
the
seven-tenths
of
1%
of
private
shareholders,
number
one.
number
two,
amoskeag
does
not
claim
that
it
was
defrauded
or
it
was
misled
by
anything
that
bangor
punta
stated,
or
that
is
got
less
than
it
paid.
amoskeag
purchased
the
stock
from
the
wrong
doer,
alleged
wrong
doer
after
the
acts
occurred
and
does
not
state
that
it
suffered
any
specific
injury.
what
it
is
attempting
to
do
by
this
action
is
obtain
a
windfall.
it
is
up
to
--
it
is
suing
to
recover
its
purchase
price
of
five
million
dollars
plus
an
additional
two
million
dollars
windfall
and
still
keep
the
railroad
and
yet
it
doesn't
state
that
it
was
injured.
now
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
generally
that
is
so.
a
corporation
is
a
legal
person
for
purposes
of
maintaining
suits
owning
property
and
we
are
doing
various
acts,
however,
in
this
case
here
the
claims
are
essentially
stockholder
claims,
essentially
equitable
claims
and
if
you
do
not
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
well,
it's
difficult
for
me
to
understand
how
one
can
say
that
a
99%
shareholder
or
affect
you
can
violate
rules
of
law
regarding
a
subsidiary
person
strictly
injured.
in
another
words
if
they
were
a
creditor
to
here
or
if
there
was
some
other
person
who
claims
injury
then
i
would
say
that
you
can't
look
behind
the
corporate
wall,
but
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
correct
exactly
because
so
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
the
seven-tenths
of
1%,
you
see
bangor
punta
owned
in
affect
99%.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
no
sir.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
it
could
be
the
same,
it
could
be
different
depending
upon
the
facts.
i
do
not
think
you
can
make
a
categorical
statement
that
the
result
would
be
the
same.
i
may
want
to
think
in
this
specific
case,
your
honor,
it
would
be
the
same.
it
would
be
like
matthews
versus
headley
case
which
i
have
cited
in
my
brief
where
you
can
by
--
there
is
no
question
here
that
if
there
is
a
recovery
here
of
the
seven
million
dollars
that
amoskeag
has
received
a
windfall.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
it
could,
if
they
acquired
their
stock
after
the
events,
they
would
have
the
same
disability
that
amoskeag
would
have,
but
i
assumed
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
that
is
right.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
oh!
absolutely.
certainly.
certainly
right.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
that's
correct.
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
it
could.
it
would
depend
upon
what
the
result
would
be
when
they
are
framing
the
relief.
if
the
relief
would
result
in
what
is
characterized
in
the
the
case
as
an
unjustified
windfall
well
then
a
court
of
equity
in
derivative
action
would
be
able
to
be
frame
decree
accordingly.
it
will
depend
upon
the
facts
of
this
specific
case.
i
don't
think
you
can
make
a
blanket
rule,
but
certainly
in
this
case
where
you
have
99%
there
is
no
question
that
there
is
a
windfall
here
and
there
is
a
no
question
that
a
court
a
frame
a
decree
in
this
case.
now
as
i
say
that
if
you
eliminate
the
public
interest
or
claimed
public
interest
which
i'll
deal
with
next
then
it
seems
that
the
reasoning
of
judge
gnew
which
was
really
agreed
to
by
the
first
circuit
that
in
the
ordinary
corporate
case
the
dismissal
of
judge
gnew
would
have
been
sustained.
rule
23.1
would
have
been
prevented
amoskeag
from
suing
itself
and
that
the
general
equitable
principles
prevent
amoskeag
through
the
guise
of
the
corporate
form
to
maintain
this
action
on
behalf
of
itself.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
only
if
amoskeag
sued.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
that
is
correct.
now
i
am
not
--
i
don't
have
to
address
myself
to
that
point.
i
would
have
to
say
i
do
think
it
would,
but
i
don't
--
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
point
in
this
case
because
in
this
case
you
have
amoskeag
standing
here
who
is
the
real
party
of
interest,
alleging
essentially
equitable
claims
and
just
a
court
should
not
permit
amoskeag
to
be
unjustly
enriched
by
using
the
device
of
the
corporate
form
unless
there
is
a
some
other
public
interest
involved.
now
what
is
this
public
interest
which
is
where
the
first
circuit
departed
from
judge
gnew.
the
first
circuit
says
that
there
is
not
easily
defined
a
point
applies
inchoate
interest
in
the
public,
in
the
financial
health
of
railroads
and
that
this
interest
is
the
basis
for
maintaining
this
action.
the
respondents
go
even
further
and
they
say
that
a
railroad
is
a
public
asset.
well
your
honor,
we
submit
that
a
railroad
is
a
private
business
corporation
with
certain
clearly
defined
public
duties
and
obligations.
the
interstate
commerce
--
congress
through
the
interstate
commerce
act
in
various
legislations
over
the
last
50
or
60
years
has
clearly
defined
those
areas
in
which
there
are
the
interest
of
the
public
are
covered
and
there
is
also
some
residual
minor
common
law
responsibilities
of
railroads.
there
is
no
claim
in
this
complaint
or
anywhere
they
raise
that
bangor
punta
violated
any
of
these
statuary
rules
or
regulations
regarding
railroads.
on
the
contrary,
the
interstate
commerce
commission
acknowledges
that
there
is
apparently
a
gap
in
this
regulation
and
this
gap
is
what
they
are
asking
this
court
to
really
rectify
the
cure.
now
this
gap,
what
i
this
gap?
this
gap
is
that
is
that
a
holding
company
in
the
late
50's
and
early
60's
holding
companies
were
formed
and
operated
subsidiary
railroads
as
wholly
owned
subsidiaries
and
this
of
course
everybody
is
familiar
with
penn
central
that
was
not
a
very
successful,
but
we
had
other
successful
one
union
specific,
just
as
there
are
number
of
network
out.
now
first
of
all
in
this
case
there
is
no
allegation
in
this
complaint
that
the
bangor
&
aroostook
can
barely
survive.
on
the
contrary
the
bangor
&
aroostook
is
a
viable
railroad.
it
is
earning
money,
it
is
paying
dividends,
it
is
paying
off
its
debts.
it
is
one
of
the
only
railroads
in
the
north-east
that
really,
probably
east
of
the
mississippi
other
than
the
chesapeake
(ph)
that
is
still
paying
dividends.
so
it's
hardly
a
railroad
which
has
suffered
the
deprivations
of
a
pirate
who
has
looted
it.
secondly,
over
the
last
60
years,
congress
has
repeatedly
addressed
to
itself
to
railroads'
operation,
public
interest
in
railroad.
it
has
provided
a
numerous
remedies
not
only
by
administrative
but
also
by
private
actions.
the
legislators
of
course
do
not
indemnify
somebody
who
can
he
has
been
injured
under
one
of
the
statuary
requirements
and
this
is
not
covered
as
it's
conceded
by
the
icc
and
by
the
respondents.
now
is
it
for
this
court
to
create
this
remedy?
we
say
no.
this
--
the
railroad
is
a
regulated
industry,
highly
regulated
industry
and
it
should
not
be
for
a
court
to
provide
new
remedies
beyond
what
congress
says
are
really
in
the
public
interest.
but
thirdly,
and
more
importantly
this
very
and
i
will
call
it
a
problem
of
parents,
parent
companies,
holding
companies
with
subsidiary
railroads
has
been
the
subject
of
congressional
hearings
and
there
are
presently
pending
legislation
in
congress
which
addresses
itself
to
this
problem.
now
should
this
court
step
forward
and
go
ahead
of
congress?
congress
has
this
very
problem
before
it.
now
it's
interesting
to
note
that
even
with
the
legislation
in
front
of
congress
which
has
been
there
for
four
years
and
has
not
been
enacted,
so
perhaps
this
problem
of
holding
companies
is
not
quite
as
severe
or
as
evil
as
some
people
would
like
to
pretend,
they
have
enacted.
this
specific
legislation
doesn't
even
cover
our
situation
here
because
the
legislation
provides
that
the
before
the
icc
can
intervene
the
service
to
the
public
in
maine
from
the
bar
has
to
be
tracking
and
there
is
no
allegation
here
and
there
can
be
no
allegation
here
that
anything
that
my
client
did
threatened
the
public
service.
so
that
when
you
come
all
away
back
down
to
what
really
on
the
bottom
line
is
that
there
really
isn't
an
identifiable
public
interest
which
can
be
injured,
which
can
give
rise
to
jurisdiction
or
standing
in
a
federal
court.
now,
when
you
get
past
that
point
you
come
to
the
really
--
the
really
bottom
line
is
that
amoskeag
here
has
not
been
injured.
it
has
not
suffered
any
injury.
if
this
general
public
somewhere
that
may
have
suffered
an
injury,
but
it
has
not
suffered
an
injury.
it
is
not
a
proper
party,
plaintiff.
someone
out
there
may
be
able
to
maintain
an
action,
but
it
is
not
the
amoskeag
through
the
device
of
the
corporate
form.
now
they
argue,
your
honor,
that
well
they
can
frame
a
decree
and
that
there
is
a
recovery
here
that
is
going
to
be
some
public
benefit
because
some
of
the
money
might
stick
in
the
bangor
&
aroostook
railroad.
well
of
course
that
is
really
as
court
of
appeals
recognized
is
really
can
be
done.
it's
absurd,
cash
is
fungible.
you
put
cash
into
a
corporation,
it
can
come
out
at
the
other
end
in
all
kinds
of
ways
as
long
as
it's
solvent.
if
it
is
solvent
it
can
legally
as
any
business
corporation
pay
dividends
and
until
somebody
says
a
solvent
corporation
can't
pay
dividends
then
how
are
you
going
stop
the
money
from
coming
out.
true
you
could
probably
put
a
district
judge
in
there
to
run
this
railroad
for
20
years
and
somehow
put
all
the
stops
in,
but
that's
certainly
not
something
that
a
court
should
do,
particularly
when
the
railroad
is
solvent.
for
that
reason,
your
honor,
we
feel
this
case
should
be
(inaudible).
mr.
james
v.
ryan
just
two
points;
mr.
justice
brennan
on
the
question
as
to
whether
a
certification
would
have
been
required
here.
in
point
four
of
our
reply
brief,
we
point
out
that
under
the
law
of
maine,
there
is
no
substantive
right
here.
that
it's
been
abridged,
that
under
the
law,
that
if
the
this
was
the
suit
in
maine
the
hyams
case
would
have
controlled
the
results.
so
there
is
no
need
to
have
a
certification
as
you
suggest
the
law
on
that
aspect
that
maine
state
law
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
i
address
your
attention
to
the
point
four,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
well,
i
think
you
use
any
windfall
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
well,
i
know
why
are
the
--
the
person
who
practice
the
corporation,
purchases
the
balance
sheet,
and
a
balance
sheet
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
the
party
is
an
uninjured
party
and
if
you
are
going
to
permit
uninjured
parties
to
maintain
action
to
recover
alleged
deprivations
of
assets,
well
then
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
i
don't
--
i
think
it's
you
can't
say
they
have
been
illegally
converted.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
well,
assume
that
they
are
illegally
converted
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
i
say
that,
there
maybe
people
who
could
maintain
the
action.
in
this
case
the
one
percent,
assuming
there
was
some
real
property
subject
to
one
percent
could
maintain
the
action
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
that
is
quite
true,
but
i
think
when
you
look
at
this
corporation,
you
look
at
what?
you
look
at
really
amoskeag?
that
is
what's
standing
there,
not
the
corporate
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
essentially
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
well,
the
only
way
i
guess,
i
could
answer
that
if
you
are
going
to
permit
that
type
of
a
situation,
then
you
are
going
to
have
a
lot
of
people
going
around
bringing
lawsuits,
who
haven't
been
injured,
but
are
going
to
re-rectifying
wrongs
and
you
know,
if
you
are
going
to
find
a
lot
people
who
are
going
to
be
able
--
who
are
going
to
want
to
go
around
and
sue
for
$5,000,000
and
they
haven't
been
injured.
now
they
claim,
they
buy
a
corporate
share
and
they
do
a
lot
of
things.
what
you
are
in
effect
saying
is
your
honor
is
that
we
should
permit
bounty
hunters.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
then,
you
are
changing
it.
here
you
have
bangor
punta
is
the
one
who
has
supposedly
have
stolen
all
the
assets.
mr.
james
v.
ryan
i
think
you
would
have
to
evaluate
each
transaction.
i
mean,
if
the
party
was
defrauded,
he
would
have
certain
remedies,
if
he
were
injured,
he
would
have
certain
remedies.
this
one
of
the
100
who
could
maintain
action,
actions
under
the
securities
law,
actions
under
the
common
law,
but
that
is
not
this
situation
because
the
person
who
was
injured,
mr
justice
white,
was
bangor
punta,
it
took
its
own
assets
and
if
you
left
the
assets
then,
as
mr
chief
justice
said
--
mr.
james
v.
ryan
i
think
that
there
is
no
injured
party
before
the
court.
now
whether
you
have
one
or
whether
you
have
a
hundred,
i
think
the
basic
proposition
is
that
amoskeag
was
not
injured
and
if
there
was
anybody
who
was
injured
it
was
bangor
punta.
i
keep
coming
back,
your
honor.
