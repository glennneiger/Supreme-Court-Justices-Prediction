justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
action
is
border
in
the
name
of
the
corporation
not
in
the
name
of
amoskeag
you
say
that
amoskeag
gets
the
real
party
in
interest
but
originally
you
do
not
look
behind
a
corporate
plaintiffs
to
see
who
the
stockholders
are
in
order
to
determine
who
are
the
real
party
in
interest
is,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
say
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
what
you
really
saying
is
that
whatever
bangor
punta
did
to
the
railroad
at
the
time
they
owned
99%
of
stock
really
wasn't
actionable
on
the
part
of
railroad
even
then?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
something
would
depend
on
when
the
other
25%
had
acquired
their
stock,
wouldn't
it
in
answer
of
mr.
justice
blackmun's
question?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
a
bangor
punta
had
been
be
only
a
75%
owner
rather
than
a
99%
owner
at
the
time
this
thing
was
going
on
then
conceivably
the
other
25%
might
have
a
very
legitimate
point?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
rule
23
by
its
turn
as
no
bearing
on
this
action,
does
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
but
amoskeag
didn't
sue.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
do
you
concede
that
the
propriety
of
judge
gnew's
ruling
if
this
were
the
alpha,
delta,
widget
company
rather
than
a
railroad?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
one
percent
it
wasn't
control
by
bangor
punta
had
brought
a
minority
stockholders
action
while
bangor
punta
owned
99%
and
forced
in
effect
the
corporation
to
sue
on
the
same
count
your
suing
on
now.
suppose
there
had
been
a
recovery,
that
recovery
would
have
operated
to
enhance
the
value
of
bar
stock,
wouldn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
to
the
extent
that
it
would
have
enhanced
the
value
of
the
stock,
amoskeag
would
have
to
pay
more
for
it
than
when
it
bought
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
because
that
wouldn't
be
treated
on
the
books
as
increase
in
earnings,
where
they
would
have
been
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
certainly
increase
--
it
was
15
million
dollars
more
in
the
corporation,
it
would
be
certainly
increase
the
net
worth?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

that's
would
have
some
effect
