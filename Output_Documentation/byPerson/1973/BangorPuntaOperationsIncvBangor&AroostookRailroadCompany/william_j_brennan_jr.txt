mr.

do
you
meet
the
court
of
appeals
holding
as
applicable
to
the
state
law
accounts
as
well
as
the
federal
question?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
both.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
maine
law
that
supports
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
supports
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
lefkowitz,
how
much
of
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals,
does
it
disagree
with
judge
gnew
on
maine
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
lefkowitz
even
as
to
the
federal
counts,
the
securities
and
exchange
act
--
now
is
it
your
view
that
independently
of
maine
law
there
is
a
federal
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
is
applicable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
even
if
maine
law
would
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals,
you
still
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
right
as
to
the
counts
with
threshold
of
federal
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

one
other
thing
mr.
lefkowitz?
maine
i
see
is
one
of
the
states
that
has
adopted
a
certification
statue,
doesn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
permits
the
federal
courts
to
ask
the
maine
supreme
court
that
what
is
maine
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
--
was
it
ever
suggested
to
the
first
circuit
that
perhaps
as
to
the
maine
law
accounts
at
least
that
there
ought
to
be
that
certification
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that's
my
difficulty,
but
you
have
got
13
counts
here
which
i
think
five
at
least
are
state
law
counts,
on
the
worst
condition
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
the
maine
public
utilities
law,
you
have
two
or
three
common
law
counts
which
i
gather
must
mean
that
maine
common
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
don't
you
think
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
extended
--
turns
on
maine
law
that
we
ought
to
ask
that
court
of
appeals
might
have
asked
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
the
supreme
court
what
the
maine
law
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
each
of
you
insist
that
the
maine
law
is
federal
in
your
favor?(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
know,
but
so
you
say
and
mr.
lefkowitz
cite
to
something
else
what
he
says
is
settles
the
law
on
his
side
of
it.
i
would
suppose
that
would
be
a
good
situation,
let
the
maine
supreme
court
follow
with
the
lawyers.
