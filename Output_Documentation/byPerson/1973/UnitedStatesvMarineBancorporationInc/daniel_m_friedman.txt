mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
washington
dismissing
after
trial
a
government
civil
anti-trust
suit
challenging
a
bank
merger
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
the
acquiring
bank,
the
national
bank
of
commerce
at
seattle
is
both
the
second
largest
bank
in
the
state
of
washington
and
the
second
largest
bank
in
the
city
of
seattle.
the
acquired
bank,
the
washington
trust
bank,
is
the
third
largest
bank
in
the
city
of
spokane.
it
is
conceded
that
the
two
banks
are
not
in
competition
with
each
other
because
the
national
bank
of
commerce
does
not
operate
in
the
city
of
spokane.
that
is
in
the
metropolitan
area
of
spokane,
which
the
district
court
held
to
be
the
relevant
geographic
market
in
this
case.
the
theory
upon
which
the
government
challenged
this
merger
was
that
the
national
bank
of
commerce
was
a
significant
potential
entrant
into
the
city
of
spokane
and
that
by
going
in
for
through
a
major
firm
in
spokane,
the
effect
of
this
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition
by
eliminating
an
important
potential
competitor.
the
court
had
a
similar
question
before
it
last
term
in
the
greeley
bank
case
of
colorado
in
which
by
an
equally
divided
court,
it
affirmed
the
district
court’s
judgment
in
that
case
dismissing
the
government’s
complaint.
and
the
united
states
has
brought
this
case
here
and
brought
the
question
back
to
the
court
because
a
major
effort
of
the
department
of
justice
in
recent
years
has
been
attempting
to
stop
what
we
consider
a
very
serious
trend
in
the
banking
industry
under
which
large
banks
headquartered
in
the
major
cities
of
the
state
are
acquiring
market
leaders
in
local
and
regional
markets.
this
is
a
relatively
new
phenomenon
in
banking.
in
the
1950’s,
we
had
a
great
wave
of
bank
mergers
in
which
bank
in
the
same
city
who
are
competitors
would
combine.
that
trend
basically
stopped
after
this
court’s
decision
of
philadelphia
bank
case.
and
what
is
been
happening
in
recent
years
is
that
more
and
more
throughout
the
country,
banks,
the
major
banks
have
been
around
the
state
acquiring
a
large
number
of
significant
banks.
and
the
effect
of
this
trend
is
to
bring
more
and
more
of
a
state’s
banking
resources
under
the
control
of
a
small
number
of
banks.
in
the
state
of
washington
itself,
for
example,
75%
of
all
the
deposits
are
now
controlled
by
five
banking
organizations,
even
though
there
are
some
90
different
banking
organizations
in
the
state.
in
some
states,
it’s
even
more
concentrated,
a
smaller
number
of
banking
organizations
hold
a
larger
percentage
of
the
shares
of
the
market.
and
the
government
believes
that
if
this
trend
is
permitted
to
continue,
the
inevitable
result
will
be
a
significant
and
serious
diminution
of
competition
in
the
banking
industry.
since
1968,
the
government
has
brought
20
cases
in
which
it
has
challenged
bank
acquisitions
on
the
theory
that
it
eliminated
the
potential
competition
which
the
acquired
bank
was
likely
to
supply
in
our
view
in
the
market
where
it
made
the
acquisition.
now,
let
me
just
briefly
refer
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
acquiring
bank.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
the
acquiring
bank
is
the
substantial
competitor
and
it
eliminates
potential
competition
which
it
would
supply
in
the
market
into
which
it
goes
through
the
acquisition.
now
let
me
just
briefly
refer
to
the
facts.
the
national
bank
of
commerce
is
a
very
large
bank.
as
i
have
indicated,
it
is
the
second
largest
bank
in
both
the
state
of
washington
and
in
the
city
of
seattle.
it
has
net
assets
of
$1.8
billion
and
its
deposits
are
more
than
$1.6
billion.
it
has
approximately
22%
of
all
the
bank
deposits
in
the
state.
it
operates
a
107
branch
offices.
the
acquired
bank,
the
washington
trust
bank,
is
the
third
largest
in
the
city
of
spokane.
it
has
total
assets
of
$112
million,
deposits
of
$95
million
and
has
eight
offices
in
the
city
of
spokane.
so,
it
itself
is
a
very
substantial
bank.
it
is
a
prosperous
bank.
in
the
five-year
period
from
1966
to
1971,
its
totaled
deposits
increased
60%;
its
total
loans
increased
70%.
it’s
considerably
a
well-managed
bank.
it
pays
very
high
salaries.
the
spokane
area
in
which
the
bank
operates
is
itself
a
prosperous
and
growing
area
although
admittedly
not
growing
as
fast
other
areas
of
the
state
of
washington.
the
district
court
found
in
the
parties
who
are
in
agreement
that
commercial
banking
is
the
relevant
product
market
in
this
case.
commercial
banking
in
the
state
of
washington
is
extremely
concentrated.
as
i’d
indicated,
the
five
largest
banks
have
75%
of
all
the
deposits
and
additionally
have
60%
of
the
banking
offices.
the
two
largest
banks,
one
of
which
is
the
national
bank
of
commerce
and
the
other
is
the
seattle
first
national
bank
together,
have
approximately
half
of
all
deposits
and
more
than
one-third
of
all
the
banking
offices.
this
pattern
of
concentration
is
repeated
throughout
the
state
but
not
surprisingly
when
you
get
into
smaller
cities,
it
becomes
even
more
concentrated,
and
in
spokane,
the
three
leading
banks
have
92%
of
all
the
deposits
and
loans,
and
there’s
almost
as
higher
concentration
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
state
of
washington
which
is
geographically
separated
from
the
western
part
of
the
state
by
a
very
high
mountain
range.
now,
in
1971,
the
two
banks
submitted
to
the
comptroller
an
application
to
merge
the
washington
trust
bank,
the
bank
in
spokane,
into
national
bank
of
commerce,
the
seattle
bank
and
the
second
largest
bank
in
the
state.
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
statute,
the
view’s
resort
of
the
two
other
bank
regulatory
agencies
and
the
department
of
justice,
all
three
of
these
groups
advised
the
comptroller
that
in
their
view
the
merger
would
substantially
lessen
competition
primarily
because
of
its
tendency
to
increase
concentration
in
the
state.
the
comptroller,
however,
approved
the
merger
and
the
government
filed
this
suit,
which
had
the
effect
of
staying
the
merger.
after
a
lengthy
trial,
the
district
court
from
the
bench
gave
a
brief
opinion
in
which
he
announced
that
he
was
holding
against
the
government
on
all
of
its
claims
and
would
dismiss
the
suit.
following
this
in
accordances
with
his
request,
the
defendants
submitted
detailed
proposed
findings
which
the
district
court
adopted
without
any
change.
the
theory
of
the
government’s
case
was
that
the
national
bank
of
commerce
could
end
the
spokane
by
alternative
means,
specifically
either
by
making
a
so-called
toehold
entry
of
a
smaller
bank
or
by,
in
effect,
opening
a
branch
through
a
procedure
that
i
will
discuss
shortly
known
as
sponsoring
a
bank
and
subsequently
then
acquiring
it.
the
district
court
made
the
following
rulings
in
rejecting
our
case:
first,
the
district
court
held
that
although
there
is
a
high
level
of
concentration
in
spokane,
nevertheless
the
market
is
competitive.
this
is
on
the
basis
of
expert
testimony
that
in
fact
there’s
a
great
deal
of
competition
in
the
market
because
of
the
large
number
of
sub
sizable
banking
organizations.
then
the
district
court
held
that
there
was
no
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
national
bank
of
commerce
would
end
the
spokane
either
by
sponsoring
the
bank
or
by
making
a
toehold
acquisition
and
that
this
merger
was
the
only
way
the
bank
could
get
in.
then
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
washington
trust
bank
itself
might
expand
outside
of
the
spokane
region.
this
was
another
theory
on
which
we
urged
that
the
merger
would
substantially
lessen
competition
by
eliminating
potential
competition
or
that
the
bank
would
join
other
banks
in
forming
a
new
holding
company,
a
smaller
holding
company
that
might
compete
against
the
large
banks
in
the
state.
and
finally,
the
court
held
that
even
if
this
merger
had,
as
he
discussed,
the
court
describe
that
some
oral
of
the
anticompetitive
effects
which
the
government
alleged
nevertheless
those
effects
would
clearly
outweigh
by
the
effect
of
the
merger
in
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
spokane
community.
i
will
discuss
these
four
grounds
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
now,
last
term
in
the
falstaff
case,
this
court
left
open
the
question
as
it
phrased
it,
whether
a
merger
would
violate
section
7
on
the
ground
that
the
acquiring
company
and
i
now
quote
“could
but
did
not
entered
de
novo
or
through
toehold
acquisition
and
that
there
is
less
competition,
then
there
would
have
been
had
entry
been
in
such
a
manner.”
we
think
this
case
presents
that
question
and
we
urge
that
the
court
should
answer
it
affirmatively,
and
then,
on
the
principle,
it
should
hold
that
this
merger
does
violate
section
7.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
let
me
deal
with
that
right
now
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
true
there
is
regulation
of
banking,
but
this
court
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
has
indicated
its
view
that
it
thinks
that
the
basic
principles,
the
governing
section
7,
particularly
the
stress
on
market
structure
and
concentration,
are
equally
applicable
to
banking,
even
thought
it
is
a
regulated
industry.
the
fact
that
there
is
regulation
means
there
is
not
quite
the
same
ease
of
entry
into
the
market
as
in
an
unregulated
industry.
but
nevertheless,
we
still
think
it
is
important
to
preserve
--
to
preserve
these
alternative
sources
of
competition.
and,
we
don’t
think
that
the
fact
that
the
comptroller
has
indicated
that
he
doesn’t
think
he
would
approve
a
merger
on
the
basis
on
what
he
now
knows
without
any
application
or
in
this
case
that
he’s
assistant,
the
regional
administrator
testified
that
he
didn’t
think
there
was
any
reasonable
likelihood
that
a
new
charter
would
be
granted.
we
don’t
think
that
that
is
enough
to
overcome
the
significant
effects
upon
concentration
in
banking
that
exist,
and
that
for
which
we
think
this
kind
of
entry
poses
the
only
possibility
of
some
help.
the
same
argument,
of
course,
was
equally
applicable
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case,
in
the
phillipsburg
case
where,
again,
you
had
to
have
regulatory
approval
before
the
merger
would
take
place.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
was
a
legislative
change
mr.
justice
to
this
extent
that
after
the
philadelphia
bank
case,
congress,
in
the
1966
bank
merger
act,
added
the
convenience
and
needs
defunct.
but
at
the
same
time,
at
the
same
time,
congress
indicated
that
it
wished
bank
mergers
to
be
tested
under
the
standards
that
had
adhibit
to
been
applied
under
the
antitrust
laws
under
section
7,
and
we
think
that
what
congress
did
in
the
1966
amendments
was
to
say
that
you
continue
to
evaluate
competitive
effect
the
same
as
it’s
always
been
evaluated.
and
i
will
mention
in
a
minute,
this
court
has
always
stressed
the
structure
of
the
market
based
on
concentration
ratios.
but
then
said,
if
it
turns
out
that
a
merger
has
the
prohibited
anticompetitive
effect,
then
and
only
then,
it’s
the
court
to
consider
whether
this
otherwise
a
illegal
merger
is
saved.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
by
convenience
and
necessity,
yes.
convenience
and
needs,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we’ve
discussed
this
in
our
brief
that
we
also
claim
that
this
was
a
perceived
entry
but
the
major
thrust
of
this
case
in
the
district
court
was
on
this
theory.
we
are
not
conceding
that
if
we
lose
on
this
theory,
we
lose
the
case,
but
this
is
the
theory
which
was
the
major
focus
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
the
question
which
is
left
open
in
falstaff
was
the
former.
but
we
do
not
concede
that
if
the
court
would
reject
that
theory
that
we
lose
this
case
because
we’ve
indicated
in
our
brief.
we
do
think
there
was
evidence
showing
that
this
bank
was
to
perceive
the
entrant.
and
we
also
have
the
other
point
which
i’ll
just
mention,
i’m
alluded
to
previously
that
if
this
--
the
effect
of
this
merger
by
making
washington
trust
a
part
of
the
national
bank
of
commerce
would
be
to
eliminate
whatever
potential
washington
trust
has
as
a
large
significant
independent
bank
and
the
spokane
market
of
expanding
beyond
that
area
and
perhaps
combining.
now,
the
reason
we
think
that
the
question
left
open
in
the
falstaff
case
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
united
states
position
is
the
whole
intent
of
congress
when
it
amended
section
7
in
1950
to
strengthen,
and
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
what
it
viewed
as
the
rising
increase
in
concentration
in
the
american
economy.
congress
recognized
that
more
and
more
proportions
of
the
economy
were
being
brought
under
the
control
of
a
small
number
of
large
firms.
and
congress,
when
it
strengthened
the
statute
in
1950,
was
concern
about
the
long-range
prospects
of
the
american
economy.
it
was
not
looking
unlike
the
sherman
act
to
the
immediate
effect
whether
a
particular
transaction
restrain
commerce;
it
was
looking
to
the
long-range
effects.
it
wanted
to
basically
to
channel
business
growth
into
procompetitive
channels
to
stop
the
practices
by
which
american
business
was
gradually
taking
more,
bringing
more
and
more
of
the
economy
under
control.
as
this
court
stated
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
that
one
premise
of
section
7
was
that
corporate
growth
by
internal
expansion
is
socially
preferable
to
growth
by
acquisition.
now,
when
a
market
becomes
concentrated,
what
happens
according
to
the
economists
is
that
the
vigor
of
competition
tends
to
diminish.
you
have
a
small
number
of
firms
in
the
market;
you
have
accommodation,
parallel
practices
begin
to
develop.
and
the
only
real
hope,
frequently,
for
even
deconcentrating
the
market
or
shaking
it
up,
so
that
there
will
be
more
competition
in
the
market,
is
if
someone
new
comes
in.
and
someone
new
comes
in,
in
a
way
that
is
going
to
force
this
new
firm
to
compete
vigorously
by
what,
an
antitrust
jargon
is
called
de
novo
entry,
that
is
they
come
in
anew
either
by
themselves
starting
the
branch
of
the
business
or
alternatively
by
making
a
toehold
acquisition,
getting
a
small
segment
of
the
market
which
enables
them
to
get
into
the
market
and
from
that
base
by
vigorous
competition
growing
and
expanding.
but
it
is
essential
to
stress
that
in
that
situation,
you
have
a
new
firm,
a
new
firm,
coming
in
to
the
market.
and
when
a
firm
that
is
on
the
outside
and
is
a
likely
entrant
by
one
of
these
two
methods,
comes
in
by
applying
a
large
share
of
the
market,
22%
in
this
case
you’ve
not
only
eliminated
the
potential
for
bringing
some
competition
and
hopefully
eventual
deconcentration
into
this
market,
but
all
you
have
done
is
substitute
one
for
the
other.
so,
you’ve
not
only
lost
an
additional
competitor
in
this
process,
but
you’ve
eliminated
the
potential
for
improving
the
competitive
situation
in
the
market.
now,
as
i
have
indicated
in
my
response
to
the
chief
justice,
we
think
that
these
principles
are
equally
applicable
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
you’ve
eliminated
the
potential
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
a
new
entry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
have
a
different
competitor
in
the
market
but
you
have
no
new
competitor.
you’ve
eliminated
mr.
justice
the
potential.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
say
basically
there’s
been
no
change
in
the
obstructure
of
this
market.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it’s
the
same
as
it
was
before
with
four
or
five
or
whatever
number
it
is.
but
although
the
structure
of
the
market
hasn’t
change,
the
structure
surrounding
the
market
has
changed
because
the
one
on
the
outside
when
they
come
in
has
been
eliminated.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice,
we
think
that
congress
in
section
7
has
made
the
judgment
that
you
cannot
justify
an
acquisition
coming
into
a
market
in
the
normal
situation
on
the
claim
that
you
will
be
able
to
compete
more
effectively
against
the
large
bank.
we
think
if
it
all
the
claim
that
the
new
bank
will
be
a
more
effective
competitor
in
the
market
is
what
congress
intended
to
be
studied
under
the
convenience
and
needs
defense,
but
that
that
is,
we
think
is
a
relevant
factor
in
determining
the
initial
threshold
question
whether
there
has
been
anticompetitive
effects.
and
as
we
develop
in
our
brief
and
i
hope
to
get
to,
we
think
in
this
case
that
the
so-called
benefits,
so-called
benefits,
which
the
district
court
found
this
merger
would
bring
to
the
city
of
spokane,
those
benefits
we
do
not
think
constitute
the
kind
of
benefits
that
congress
intended
to
recognize.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
mr.
justice
because
the
stress
of
section
7
is
on
the
long-term
picture,
on
the
long-term
picture.
initially,
it
may
well
be
that
a
bank
coming
in
substituting
itself
for
a
somewhat
weaker
back,
may
produce
an
immediate
floury
of
competition,
a
little
more
competitive.
but
in
the
long
run,
in
the
long
run
we
think,
it’s
anticompetitive
because
it
stills
a
concentrated
market
and
you’ve
lost
one
of
the
significant
potentials
for
deconcentration.
i
may
add
in
this
case,
this
is
not
a
case
of
the
acquiring
bank
coming
in
because
the
acquired
bank
is
weak
or
floundering.
this
is
a
successful,
very
prosperous,
good
bank.
it’s
a
large
bank.
it’s
a
bank
that’s
roughly
$100
million
to
claim
here
is
defy
the
larger
bank
coming
in,
it
will
enable
the
new
bank
to
provide
certain
specialized
services
which,
because
of
its
smaller
size,
it’s
not
been
able
to
provide.
services,
which
i
might
add,
are
available
in
spokane
through
other
banks
already
in
the
market.
and
we
think
that
that
kind
of
benefit
is
not
enough
to
justify
this
merger.
the
whole
purpose
of
section
7
is
to
try
to
stop
the
increases
in
concentration,
to
try
stop
these
what
congress
believed
to
be
deleterious
friends
in
the
economy,
and
banking
itself
unfortunately
tends
to
be
concentrated.
banking
tends
to
be
concentrated.
most
cities
except
perhaps
with
city
like
new
york,
we
have
a
large
number
of
banks,
you
find
that
banking
is
concentrated,
and
this,
it
seems
to
us,
is
all
the
more
important
in
banking
to
preserve
the
possibility
of
deconcentration
resulting
from
the
entrant
of
a
potential
competitor,
a
strong,
significant,
powerful
firm
that
seeks
together
into
the
market.
we
think
that’s
the
whole
purpose
that
congress
had
when
it
amended
section
7
in
1950
in
order
to
strengthen
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
in
spokane
mr.
justice,
but
let
me
explain
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice
for
the
reason
that
under
state
law,
a
bank
that
has
its
headquarters
in
one
city
is
not
permitted
to
branch
outside
of
that
city
or
the
county
where
its
headquarter
is
or
into
an
incorporated
village
that
does
not
have
a
bank.
we
do
not
have
in
the
city
of
spokane
any
history
of
de
novo
branching.
we
have
one
bank
that
was
found
in
the
1955,
but
what
we
do
have
mr.
justice,
what
we
do
have
is
a
history
in
the
state
of
washington
of
a
practice
by
banks
of
sponsoring
banks,
assisting
in
their
organization,
helping
them
get
started
and
then
subsequently
acquire
them.
we
do
have
that
practice.
we
do
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there’s
a
dispute
to
that.
the
appellees
contend
that
the
practice
is
illegal.
we
think
it
is
legal.
let
me
just
briefly
--
i
will
come
to
it
later.
let
me
just
briefly
refer
to
what
the
practice
has
been
and
what
the
record
shows.
one
of
the
banks
in
washington,
the
fifth
largest
bank,
the
old
national
bank,
itself
has
assisted
in
the
organization
of
five
banks,
which
it
subsequently
acquired.
and
according
to
the
deposition
of
a
mr.
witherspoon,
who
is
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
the
old
national
bank,
they
assisted
and
sponsored
these
banks
and
i
would
quote
“with
the
hope
and
belief
that
we
would
be
able
to
acquire
them
in
the
future
and
make
branches
of
the
old
national
there.”
and
that’s
at
page
608
of
the
record.
he
also
stated
in
his
deposition
that
they
had
informed
the
comptroller
of
what
they
intended
to
do,
the
way
he
described
it
as
the
informer
comptroller
of
their
efforts
to
establish
branches
by
this
means.
that’s
at
page
610.
and
when
he
was
asked
to
the
comptroller
object
to
this,
he
said
on
the
contrary,
in
one
instance
it
was
the
comptroller,
that
is,
rather
the
assistance
comptroller
in
the
presence
of
the
comptroller
who
suggested
that
they
follow
this
practice.
and
in
subsequently
approving
merges
of
banks
in
the
state
of
washington
between
the
sponsoring
bank
and
the
sponsored
bank
the
comptroller
has
recognized
that
the
bank
did
play
this
role.
now,
the
acquiring
bank
in
this
case,
the
national
bank
of
commerce,
itself
on
one
occasion
sponsored
a
bank
in
the
so-called
columbia
shopping
center.
now,
the
claim
is
that
they
had
no
intention
of
ever
acquiring
it.
well,
this
record
shows
that
from
months
on
end,
a
number
of
important
officials
of
the
national
bank
of
commerce
were
concerned
with
all
the
details
of
this
bank.
they
aided
and
they
found
help
find
the
manager
for
the
bank.
on
one
occasion,
the
board
of
directors
of
the
national
bank
of
commerce
personally
selected
a
man
who
subsequently
declined
the
post
to
be
the
president
of
this
new
bank,
and,
as
they
say,
they
say
“well,
we
hope
to
be
able
to
acquire
the
bank”.
and
it
seems
to
us
in
the
light
of
this,
it’s
much
more
than
they
hope.
they
obviously
anticipated
that
they
would
be
able
to
do
that.
on
another
occasion,
there’s
an
internal
memorandum
in
which,
in
1971,
the
director
of
marketing
research
for
the
national
bank
of
commerce
suggested
to
an
assistant
vice
president
of
the
bank
that
perhaps
i
might
spoke
the
word
he
used
was
“sponsor”
a
bank
in
another
smaller
city
in
oregon,
pullman
and
that’s
shown
in
the
record.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
has
not
yet
come
to
past?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
no
waiting
period
with
respect
to
federally
chartered
banks
with
respect
to
state
chartered
banks,
there
is
a
requirement
that
accept
with
the
consent
of
the
state
superintendent
of
banking,
“no
bank
can
sell
any
of
its
shares
that
controlling
it
for
ten
years
from
the
time
of
acquisition”.
but
the
normal
theory
of
this
is
that
we
concede
that
you
could
not,
under
state
law,
form
and
sponsor
banks
solely
for
the
purpose
of
acquiring
it
or
with
an
expressed
intention,
expressed
understanding
or
agreement
to
do
so.
the
way
it’s
done
that
the
bank
and
sponsor
that
has
to
be
on
its
own
two
feet;
it
has
to
get
going
and
at
that
point
then
the
acquisition
takes
place.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
wouldn’t
say
conceal,
i
wouldn’t
conceal
mr.
justice.
what
i
would
suggest
is
that
this
is
a
recognized
technique
in
the
state
of
washington
by
which
banks
get
into
markets
where
they
are
not
directly
permitted.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
could
not
tell
you
--
i
couldn’t
tell
you
exactly
that.
the
record
shows
i
think
for
between
1960
and
1967,
there
were
i
believe
14
banks
acquired
in
the
state
of
washington.
i
don’t
know
that
the
record
shows
which
of
those
were
sponsored
and
subsequently
quo.
we
do
know,
we
do
know
mr.
justice
however,
that
at
least
five
banks
that
were
sponsored
by
the
old
national
bank
were
subsequently
acquired
by
that
bank
in
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
am
sorry.
your
question
is
you
mean
there’s
no
question
that
the
existing
organization
does
organize
the
bank?
oh
yes,
there’s
no
question
about
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
the
organization
of
bringing
a
new
competitor
in.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
not
question
for
that,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i’m
not
certain
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
provides
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
one
new
bank
that
i
know.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
started
from
scratch.
this
is
something
called
the
american
commercial
bank
and
this
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
1955
and
this
is
one
of
the
banks
as
i
will
come
to
--
that
we
think
was
available
as
a
toehold
entry
by
this
bank.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
this
new
banking
organization
--
in
fact,
this
banking
organization
now
has
four
branches
since
it
started
with
a
single
and
it’s
grown
and
now
it
has
four
branches
which
is
only
three
fewer
than
the
washington
trust
bank.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
if
the
newly
organized
unit
is
not
later
acquired,
you
don’t
--
and
it
maybe
more
difficult
to
say
that
the
putative
acquiring
bank
is
eliminated
as
a
substantial
competitor,
that
is
--
what
i
am
suggesting
is
if
it’s
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
the
new
back
is
--
once
the
new
bank
has
been
organized
and
once
the
new
bank
is
in
the
market,
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
a
competitor.
now,
that
fact
itself
of
course
does
not
necessarily
eliminate
the
sponsoring
bank
as
an
entrant
to
the
market
although
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
basic
problem
there,
i
suppose,
is
whether
the
market
would
stand
two
additional
banks.
in
other
words,
it
may
depending
again
on
its
relationship
--
ordinarily
the
relationship
is
one
would
expect
between
the
sponsoring
and
the
sponsored
bank
is
very
close.
they
normally
have
that
correspondent
relationships
and
stuff.
but
the
fact
is
that,
of
course,
this
does
inject
a
new
bank
into
the
market.
but
the
question
really,
it
seems
to
me,
is
whether
fairly
viewed,
if
the
acquiring
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
surely
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
surely
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
the
question
we
posed
is
on
what
basis
is
the
trial
court
to
decide
that
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right,
and
we
think
there
are
two
banks
in
the
market
that
it
could
have
acquired.
one
of
them
is
the
american
commercial
bank
which
we
has
been
discussing
that
was
organized
in
1965,
which
is
a
bank
with
15
million
in
deposits,
four
branches
in
the
city
of
spokane,
roughly
3%
of
the
market.
now,
the
reason
that
the
district
court
held
on
the
defendant’s
contend,
this
would
not
be
a
suitable
candidate
for
acquisition
is
that
under
the
ten-year
limitation
on
state
law,
and
this,
of
course,
is
the
state
organized
bank,
this
bank
would
not
be
available
for
acquisition
until
1975.
again,
my
answer
to
that
is
we
are
dealing
here
with
very
long
term
trends.
the
question
is
whether
if
the
national
bank
of
commerce
would
not
be
permitted
to
go
under
the
market
through
this
merger,
is
it
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
they
would
have
found
some
other
way
to
go
in?
now,
and
in
addition
to
this
other
bank,
there’s
another
bank
the
farmers
&
merchants
bank
which
is
a
little
smaller
that
it
has
three
offices.
these
of
course
are
offices
in
the
suburbs
and
the
interest
of
the
national
bank
of
washington
in
this
bank,
i
think
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
shortly
before
the
merger,
they
were
discussing
a
possible
acquisition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice,
no
mr.
justice.
our
position
is
that
the
--
we
do
not
oppose,
we
do
not
oppose,
the
entry
by
large
statewide
banks
into
local
and
regional
banking
markets,
but
we
say
those
--
that
entry
should
take
place
in
the
least
anticompetitive
way
and
we
think
an
entry,
if
they
had
acquired
--
attempted
to
acquire
this
bank
with
only
3%
of
the
market,
we
would
have
view
that
as
a
so-called
permissible
toehold
acquisition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
district
court
did
not
find
mr.
justice,
the
district
court
did
not
find
that
this
was
no
difference
than
a
toehold
acquisition.
the
district
court
did
not
--
and
i
think
at
some
point
the
matter
of
decree
becomes
a
matter
of
quality,
but
it’s
not
just
quantity,
because
when
they
acquire
a
bank
with
22%
of
the
market,
that
to
us
is
a
very
different
thing
from
acquiring
a
bank
with
3%
of
the
market.
they
acquire
back
with
3%
of
the
market,
they’re
not
going
to
be
satisfied,
it
seems
to
me,
a
bank
like
the
national
bank
of
commerce,
coming
into
spokane
with
3%
of
the
market
and
setting
there
with
3%
of
the
market.
they’re
going
to
compete
as
vigorously
as
possible
and
attempt
to
get
into
that
market
and
to
expend
their
share
of
the
market.
whereas
if
all
they
do
is
acquire
this
22%
share
there
in
the
typical
situation
where
you
have
a
small
number,
three
in
these
case
of
the
bank
with
92%
of
the
market.
what
you
have
is
you
have
the
same
basic
structure
inside
the
market
and
you
don’t
have
the
same
kind
of
incentive
to
compete
to
be
--
to
bring
and
inject
some
new
vigor
into
the
market
to
possibly
deconcentrate
the
market
that
you
would
have
if
they
came
in
by
acquiring
a
small
bank,
a
bank
with
a
very
small
share
which
would
be
the
basis
for
growing.
now,
let
me
turn
to
something
else
which
is
we
have
been
discussing
how
they
get
in.
i
think
it’s
important
to
find
out
is
that
the
sort
of
thing
they
would
likely
to
do,
that
they
want
to
get
in
to
spokane.
how
important
was
it
to
this
bank
to
get
into
spokane,
so
that
if
they
were
unable,
if
they
were
unable
to
get
in
by
making
this
large
acquisition,
they
do
everything
they
could
to
get
in
by
some
on
to
that.
we
think
there
is
no
question
about
that,
that
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
the
national
bank
of
commerce
has
wanted
to
do
for
a
long,
long
time.
to
begin
with,
although
the
national
bank
of
commerce
is
the
second
largest
bank
in
the
state,
it’s
the
only
one
bank
that
is
represented
in
only
one
of
the
four
largest
cities.
it
is
represented
only
in
seattle.
it
is
not
represented
in
spokane,
the
second
largest
tacoma
or
everett,
the
next
three
largest
cities
in
the
state.
the
parties
to
this
case
stipulated
that
representation
in
spokane
has
been
a
long
sort
goal
of
nbc.
that’s
at
367
of
the
record.
the
former
president
of
the
national
bank
of
commerce
who
is
now
the
president
of
marine
bancorporation,
which
is
the
bank
holding
company
that
has
all
of
the
stock
of
the
bank,
stated
that
his
bank
has
been
interested
in
getting
into
spokane
for
a
long,
long
time.
he
said
since
prior
to
1933,
roughly
more
than
40
years.
he
explained
in
the
deposition
that
it
was
important
for
the
national
bank
of
spokane
to
get
in
there
because
all
of
the
other
major
banks
are
represented
there,
and
he
said
we
feel
there’s
business
available
to
us
in
spokane
if
we
are
represented
there,
that’s
at
page
139
of
the
record.
and
similarly
in
the
--
its
1970
report
to
stockholders,
the
holding
company
in
commenting
on
this
merger
said
that
this
finally
brought
the
national
bank
of
commerce
“within
sight
of
one
of
its
long
sort
goals
representation
in
the
city
of
spokane.”
that’s
at
page
1270
of
the
record.
and
indeed
in
a
brief
filed
with
the
comptroller
in
support
of
this
merger,
a
so-called
economic
brief,
discussing
the
economics
of
the
area
and
probably
the
economics
of
the
merger
itself,
what
the
bank
said
was
and
i
quote
again
from
page
1743
that
“if
commerce
is
to
maintain
its
present
relative
position
with
its
competitors
and
maintain
the
business
of
its
major
national
customers,
commerce
must
have
representation
in
spokane.”
“must”
was
the
words
they
used,
not
that
they
like
to,
not
they
thought
it
was
so,
they
must
have
representation
in
spokane.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
and
one
example
i
suppose
mr.
justice,
one
example,
was
their
attempt
shortly
before
this
merger
took
place
to
purchase
the
stock
of
the
american
commercial.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice,
i
didn’t
make
my
self
clear.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we’re
not
suggesting
there
is
anything
wrong.
in
fact,
it’s
quite
understandable
and
quite
appropriate
for
this
bank
to
want
to
get
into
the
spokane
market.
what
we
are
arguing
is
the
fact
that
this
bank
was
so
anxious
and
felt
it’s
so
important
to
get
into
spokane
is
clear
indication
and
shows
that
it
would
have
done
everything
it
could
to
try
to
get
in
by
these
alternative
means
if
it
were
not
permitted
to
go
in
by
acquiring
this
large
bank
in
the
market
now.
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
has
been
some
reference
by
mr.
moen
to
the
testimony
of
the
president
of
the
columbia
bank,
the
bank
that
was
sponsored
in,
and
we
referred
to
the
columbia
bank
not
that
that’s
a
way
of
getting
into
spokane,
but
to
show,
to
show
that
this
is
a
method
by
which
banks
do
enter
markets
where
they
are
not
permitted
directly
to
branch.
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
two
documents
in
the
record.
the
first
is
at
page
1514
of
the
record.
it’s
a
letter
from
mr.
buck,
who
was
the
senior
vice
president
of
the
national
bank
of
commerce
to
a
mr.
looney.
mr.
looney
was
an
attorney
in
the
area
where
the
columbia
bank
was
being
formed
who
became
--
he
had
done
some
work
for
the
branch
of
the
national
bank
of
commerce
in
this
area
and
he
ultimately
became
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
the
new
bank.
so,
he
was
the
man
who
was
intimately
concerned
in
the
formation
of
the
bank
and
understanding
what
was
happening.
now,
two
paragraphs
i’d
like
to
refer
to.
the
first
is
in
the
middle
of
that
page.
at
1514
he
said
that
there’s
been
no
--mr.
bulk
said,
there
has
been
no
written
or
oral
agreement
or
understanding
with
respect
to
acquisition
of
the
proposed
bank.
on
advice
of
counsel,
we
have
been
extremely
perhaps
excessively
cautious
to
avoid
this.
it
is
true
nevertheless
that
our
bank
has
inspired
submission
of
the
application
and
is
hopeful
that
in
appropriate
future
time,
it
will
possible
to
acquire
the
bank
for
incorporation
within
its
present
system.
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
i
pointed
out
that
the
way
the
bank
was
being
arranged,
the
majority
stock
will
be
in
hands
friendly
to
the
national
bank
of
commerce.
in
order
to
insure
as
much
as
possible
its
future
as
a
branch
of
that
bank,
it
avoids
certain
legal
problems,
which
could
arise
if
we
were
to
agree
or
contract
with
respect
to
its
acquisition.
then
at
page
1573
is
a
letter
from
mr.
looney
back
to
mr.
buck
written
a
few
months
later
and
these
letters
were
all
contemporaneously
written
at
the
time
the
columbia
bank
was
being
organized.
and
what
mr.
looney
said
to
mr.
buck
at
the
bottom
of
page
1513
is
“we
need
a
clear
definition
in
understanding
of
the
management
responsibilities
as
between
the
directors
of
the
unit
bank
and
the
management
of
the
national
bank
of
commerce.”
that’s
between
the
bank
that
was
sponsoring
and
the
bank
that
was
sponsored.
for
example,
many
of
the
steps
taken
initially
will
have
a
barring
on
the
long
range
operation
of
the
bank
many
years
after
it
has
changed
from
a
unit
bank
to
a
branch
bank.
now,
this
seems
to
us
to
indicate
very
clearly
that
the
whole
purpose
of
this
arrangement
was
ultimately
to
permit
the
national
bank
of
commerce
to
acquire
it.
now
mr.
loevinger
has
suggested
that
because
the
authorization
of
the
regulatory
authorities
is
needed
before
a
bank
can
enter
the
market.
if
the
regulatory
authorities
suggest,
they
would
not
charter
a
new
bank,
that’s
kind
of
the
end
of
a
thing.
well,
to
begin
with,
i
just
point
out
that
that
argument
of
course
has
no
application
to
the
possibility
of
entry
by
making
a
foothold
acquisition.
but
more
fundamentally,
it
seems
to
us
this
is
basically
not
the
scheme
of
section
7,
this
is
not
what
congress
did
not
intend
to
give
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
the
authority
to
veto,
the
authority
to
veto
that
the
enforcement
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
when
the
comptroller
says
that
he
does
not
think
it’s
likely
that
he
would
charter
a
new
bank,
to
begin
with
of
course,
his
testimony
is
given
in
defense
of
a
merger
that
he
is
already
approved.
but
more
importantly,
of
course,
the
regional
comptroller
only
makes
a
recommendation,
but
a
regional
official
may
think
today
he
is
not
going
to
charter
tomorrow
or
next
week
changes
may
occur.
and
we
do
believe
that
in
this
situation,
the
comptroller’s
view
that
he
would
not
permit
a
new
bank
to
be
charted
cannot
be
this
positive
on
this
question.
thank
you.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
a
judgment
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
washington
dismissing
after
trial
a
government
civil
anti-trust
suit
challenging
a
bank
merger
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
the
acquiring
bank,
the
national
bank
of
commerce
at
seattle
is
both
the
second
largest
bank
in
the
state
of
washington
and
the
second
largest
bank
in
the
city
of
seattle.
the
acquired
bank,
the
washington
trust
bank,
is
the
third
largest
bank
in
the
city
of
spokane.
it
is
conceded
that
the
two
banks
are
not
in
competition
with
each
other
because
the
national
bank
of
commerce
does
not
operate
in
the
city
of
spokane.
that
is
in
the
metropolitan
area
of
spokane,
which
the
district
court
held
to
be
the
relevant
geographic
market
in
this
case.
the
theory
upon
which
the
government
challenged
this
merger
was
that
the
national
bank
of
commerce
was
a
significant
potential
entrant
into
the
city
of
spokane
and
that
by
going
in
for
through
a
major
firm
in
spokane,
the
effect
of
this
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition
by
eliminating
an
important
potential
competitor.
the
court
had
a
similar
question
before
it
last
term
in
the
greeley
bank
case
of
colorado
in
which
by
an
equally
divided
court,
it
affirmed
the
district
court’s
judgment
in
that
case
dismissing
the
government’s
complaint.
and
the
united
states
has
brought
this
case
here
and
brought
the
question
back
to
the
court
because
a
major
effort
of
the
department
of
justice
in
recent
years
has
been
attempting
to
stop
what
we
consider
a
very
serious
trend
in
the
banking
industry
under
which
large
banks
headquartered
in
the
major
cities
of
the
state
are
acquiring
market
leaders
in
local
and
regional
markets.
this
is
a
relatively
new
phenomenon
in
banking.
in
the
1950’s,
we
had
a
great
wave
of
bank
mergers
in
which
bank
in
the
same
city
who
are
competitors
would
combine.
that
trend
basically
stopped
after
this
court’s
decision
of
philadelphia
bank
case.
and
what
is
been
happening
in
recent
years
is
that
more
and
more
throughout
the
country,
banks,
the
major
banks
have
been
around
the
state
acquiring
a
large
number
of
significant
banks.
and
the
effect
of
this
trend
is
to
bring
more
and
more
of
a
state’s
banking
resources
under
the
control
of
a
small
number
of
banks.
in
the
state
of
washington
itself,
for
example,
75%
of
all
the
deposits
are
now
controlled
by
five
banking
organizations,
even
though
there
are
some
90
different
banking
organizations
in
the
state.
in
some
states,
it’s
even
more
concentrated,
a
smaller
number
of
banking
organizations
hold
a
larger
percentage
of
the
shares
of
the
market.
and
the
government
believes
that
if
this
trend
is
permitted
to
continue,
the
inevitable
result
will
be
a
significant
and
serious
diminution
of
competition
in
the
banking
industry.
since
1968,
the
government
has
brought
20
cases
in
which
it
has
challenged
bank
acquisitions
on
the
theory
that
it
eliminated
the
potential
competition
which
the
acquired
bank
was
likely
to
supply
in
our
view
in
the
market
where
it
made
the
acquisition.
now,
let
me
just
briefly
refer
to
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
the
acquiring
bank.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
the
acquiring
bank
is
the
substantial
competitor
and
it
eliminates
potential
competition
which
it
would
supply
in
the
market
into
which
it
goes
through
the
acquisition.
now
let
me
just
briefly
refer
to
the
facts.
the
national
bank
of
commerce
is
a
very
large
bank.
as
i
have
indicated,
it
is
the
second
largest
bank
in
both
the
state
of
washington
and
in
the
city
of
seattle.
it
has
net
assets
of
$1.8
billion
and
its
deposits
are
more
than
$1.6
billion.
it
has
approximately
22%
of
all
the
bank
deposits
in
the
state.
it
operates
a
107
branch
offices.
the
acquired
bank,
the
washington
trust
bank,
is
the
third
largest
in
the
city
of
spokane.
it
has
total
assets
of
$112
million,
deposits
of
$95
million
and
has
eight
offices
in
the
city
of
spokane.
so,
it
itself
is
a
very
substantial
bank.
it
is
a
prosperous
bank.
in
the
five-year
period
from
1966
to
1971,
its
totaled
deposits
increased
60%;
its
total
loans
increased
70%.
it’s
considerably
a
well-managed
bank.
it
pays
very
high
salaries.
the
spokane
area
in
which
the
bank
operates
is
itself
a
prosperous
and
growing
area
although
admittedly
not
growing
as
fast
other
areas
of
the
state
of
washington.
the
district
court
found
in
the
parties
who
are
in
agreement
that
commercial
banking
is
the
relevant
product
market
in
this
case.
commercial
banking
in
the
state
of
washington
is
extremely
concentrated.
as
i’d
indicated,
the
five
largest
banks
have
75%
of
all
the
deposits
and
additionally
have
60%
of
the
banking
offices.
the
two
largest
banks,
one
of
which
is
the
national
bank
of
commerce
and
the
other
is
the
seattle
first
national
bank
together,
have
approximately
half
of
all
deposits
and
more
than
one-third
of
all
the
banking
offices.
this
pattern
of
concentration
is
repeated
throughout
the
state
but
not
surprisingly
when
you
get
into
smaller
cities,
it
becomes
even
more
concentrated,
and
in
spokane,
the
three
leading
banks
have
92%
of
all
the
deposits
and
loans,
and
there’s
almost
as
higher
concentration
in
the
eastern
part
of
the
state
of
washington
which
is
geographically
separated
from
the
western
part
of
the
state
by
a
very
high
mountain
range.
now,
in
1971,
the
two
banks
submitted
to
the
comptroller
an
application
to
merge
the
washington
trust
bank,
the
bank
in
spokane,
into
national
bank
of
commerce,
the
seattle
bank
and
the
second
largest
bank
in
the
state.
in
accordance
with
the
requirements
of
the
statute,
the
view’s
resort
of
the
two
other
bank
regulatory
agencies
and
the
department
of
justice,
all
three
of
these
groups
advised
the
comptroller
that
in
their
view
the
merger
would
substantially
lessen
competition
primarily
because
of
its
tendency
to
increase
concentration
in
the
state.
the
comptroller,
however,
approved
the
merger
and
the
government
filed
this
suit,
which
had
the
effect
of
staying
the
merger.
after
a
lengthy
trial,
the
district
court
from
the
bench
gave
a
brief
opinion
in
which
he
announced
that
he
was
holding
against
the
government
on
all
of
its
claims
and
would
dismiss
the
suit.
following
this
in
accordances
with
his
request,
the
defendants
submitted
detailed
proposed
findings
which
the
district
court
adopted
without
any
change.
the
theory
of
the
government’s
case
was
that
the
national
bank
of
commerce
could
end
the
spokane
by
alternative
means,
specifically
either
by
making
a
so-called
toehold
entry
of
a
smaller
bank
or
by,
in
effect,
opening
a
branch
through
a
procedure
that
i
will
discuss
shortly
known
as
sponsoring
a
bank
and
subsequently
then
acquiring
it.
the
district
court
made
the
following
rulings
in
rejecting
our
case:
first,
the
district
court
held
that
although
there
is
a
high
level
of
concentration
in
spokane,
nevertheless
the
market
is
competitive.
this
is
on
the
basis
of
expert
testimony
that
in
fact
there’s
a
great
deal
of
competition
in
the
market
because
of
the
large
number
of
sub
sizable
banking
organizations.
then
the
district
court
held
that
there
was
no
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
national
bank
of
commerce
would
end
the
spokane
either
by
sponsoring
the
bank
or
by
making
a
toehold
acquisition
and
that
this
merger
was
the
only
way
the
bank
could
get
in.
then
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
washington
trust
bank
itself
might
expand
outside
of
the
spokane
region.
this
was
another
theory
on
which
we
urged
that
the
merger
would
substantially
lessen
competition
by
eliminating
potential
competition
or
that
the
bank
would
join
other
banks
in
forming
a
new
holding
company,
a
smaller
holding
company
that
might
compete
against
the
large
banks
in
the
state.
and
finally,
the
court
held
that
even
if
this
merger
had,
as
he
discussed,
the
court
describe
that
some
oral
of
the
anticompetitive
effects
which
the
government
alleged
nevertheless
those
effects
would
clearly
outweigh
by
the
effect
of
the
merger
in
meeting
the
convenience
and
needs
of
the
spokane
community.
i
will
discuss
these
four
grounds
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
now,
last
term
in
the
falstaff
case,
this
court
left
open
the
question
as
it
phrased
it,
whether
a
merger
would
violate
section
7
on
the
ground
that
the
acquiring
company
and
i
now
quote
“could
but
did
not
entered
de
novo
or
through
toehold
acquisition
and
that
there
is
less
competition,
then
there
would
have
been
had
entry
been
in
such
a
manner.”
we
think
this
case
presents
that
question
and
we
urge
that
the
court
should
answer
it
affirmatively,
and
then,
on
the
principle,
it
should
hold
that
this
merger
does
violate
section
7.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
let
me
deal
with
that
right
now
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
true
there
is
regulation
of
banking,
but
this
court
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
has
indicated
its
view
that
it
thinks
that
the
basic
principles,
the
governing
section
7,
particularly
the
stress
on
market
structure
and
concentration,
are
equally
applicable
to
banking,
even
thought
it
is
a
regulated
industry.
the
fact
that
there
is
regulation
means
there
is
not
quite
the
same
ease
of
entry
into
the
market
as
in
an
unregulated
industry.
but
nevertheless,
we
still
think
it
is
important
to
preserve
--
to
preserve
these
alternative
sources
of
competition.
and,
we
don’t
think
that
the
fact
that
the
comptroller
has
indicated
that
he
doesn’t
think
he
would
approve
a
merger
on
the
basis
on
what
he
now
knows
without
any
application
or
in
this
case
that
he’s
assistant,
the
regional
administrator
testified
that
he
didn’t
think
there
was
any
reasonable
likelihood
that
a
new
charter
would
be
granted.
we
don’t
think
that
that
is
enough
to
overcome
the
significant
effects
upon
concentration
in
banking
that
exist,
and
that
for
which
we
think
this
kind
of
entry
poses
the
only
possibility
of
some
help.
the
same
argument,
of
course,
was
equally
applicable
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case,
in
the
phillipsburg
case
where,
again,
you
had
to
have
regulatory
approval
before
the
merger
would
take
place.
now
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
was
a
legislative
change
mr.
justice
to
this
extent
that
after
the
philadelphia
bank
case,
congress,
in
the
1966
bank
merger
act,
added
the
convenience
and
needs
defunct.
but
at
the
same
time,
at
the
same
time,
congress
indicated
that
it
wished
bank
mergers
to
be
tested
under
the
standards
that
had
adhibit
to
been
applied
under
the
antitrust
laws
under
section
7,
and
we
think
that
what
congress
did
in
the
1966
amendments
was
to
say
that
you
continue
to
evaluate
competitive
effect
the
same
as
it’s
always
been
evaluated.
and
i
will
mention
in
a
minute,
this
court
has
always
stressed
the
structure
of
the
market
based
on
concentration
ratios.
but
then
said,
if
it
turns
out
that
a
merger
has
the
prohibited
anticompetitive
effect,
then
and
only
then,
it’s
the
court
to
consider
whether
this
otherwise
a
illegal
merger
is
saved.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
by
convenience
and
necessity,
yes.
convenience
and
needs,
i
am
sorry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we’ve
discussed
this
in
our
brief
that
we
also
claim
that
this
was
a
perceived
entry
but
the
major
thrust
of
this
case
in
the
district
court
was
on
this
theory.
we
are
not
conceding
that
if
we
lose
on
this
theory,
we
lose
the
case,
but
this
is
the
theory
which
was
the
major
focus
in
this
case.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
and
the
question
which
is
left
open
in
falstaff
was
the
former.
but
we
do
not
concede
that
if
the
court
would
reject
that
theory
that
we
lose
this
case
because
we’ve
indicated
in
our
brief.
we
do
think
there
was
evidence
showing
that
this
bank
was
to
perceive
the
entrant.
and
we
also
have
the
other
point
which
i’ll
just
mention,
i’m
alluded
to
previously
that
if
this
--
the
effect
of
this
merger
by
making
washington
trust
a
part
of
the
national
bank
of
commerce
would
be
to
eliminate
whatever
potential
washington
trust
has
as
a
large
significant
independent
bank
and
the
spokane
market
of
expanding
beyond
that
area
and
perhaps
combining.
now,
the
reason
we
think
that
the
question
left
open
in
the
falstaff
case
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
united
states
position
is
the
whole
intent
of
congress
when
it
amended
section
7
in
1950
to
strengthen,
and
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
what
it
viewed
as
the
rising
increase
in
concentration
in
the
american
economy.
congress
recognized
that
more
and
more
proportions
of
the
economy
were
being
brought
under
the
control
of
a
small
number
of
large
firms.
and
congress,
when
it
strengthened
the
statute
in
1950,
was
concern
about
the
long-range
prospects
of
the
american
economy.
it
was
not
looking
unlike
the
sherman
act
to
the
immediate
effect
whether
a
particular
transaction
restrain
commerce;
it
was
looking
to
the
long-range
effects.
it
wanted
to
basically
to
channel
business
growth
into
procompetitive
channels
to
stop
the
practices
by
which
american
business
was
gradually
taking
more,
bringing
more
and
more
of
the
economy
under
control.
as
this
court
stated
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
that
one
premise
of
section
7
was
that
corporate
growth
by
internal
expansion
is
socially
preferable
to
growth
by
acquisition.
now,
when
a
market
becomes
concentrated,
what
happens
according
to
the
economists
is
that
the
vigor
of
competition
tends
to
diminish.
you
have
a
small
number
of
firms
in
the
market;
you
have
accommodation,
parallel
practices
begin
to
develop.
and
the
only
real
hope,
frequently,
for
even
deconcentrating
the
market
or
shaking
it
up,
so
that
there
will
be
more
competition
in
the
market,
is
if
someone
new
comes
in.
and
someone
new
comes
in,
in
a
way
that
is
going
to
force
this
new
firm
to
compete
vigorously
by
what,
an
antitrust
jargon
is
called
de
novo
entry,
that
is
they
come
in
anew
either
by
themselves
starting
the
branch
of
the
business
or
alternatively
by
making
a
toehold
acquisition,
getting
a
small
segment
of
the
market
which
enables
them
to
get
into
the
market
and
from
that
base
by
vigorous
competition
growing
and
expanding.
but
it
is
essential
to
stress
that
in
that
situation,
you
have
a
new
firm,
a
new
firm,
coming
in
to
the
market.
and
when
a
firm
that
is
on
the
outside
and
is
a
likely
entrant
by
one
of
these
two
methods,
comes
in
by
applying
a
large
share
of
the
market,
22%
in
this
case
you’ve
not
only
eliminated
the
potential
for
bringing
some
competition
and
hopefully
eventual
deconcentration
into
this
market,
but
all
you
have
done
is
substitute
one
for
the
other.
so,
you’ve
not
only
lost
an
additional
competitor
in
this
process,
but
you’ve
eliminated
the
potential
for
improving
the
competitive
situation
in
the
market.
now,
as
i
have
indicated
in
my
response
to
the
chief
justice,
we
think
that
these
principles
are
equally
applicable
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
you’ve
eliminated
the
potential
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
a
new
entry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
you
have
a
different
competitor
in
the
market
but
you
have
no
new
competitor.
you’ve
eliminated
mr.
justice
the
potential.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
say
basically
there’s
been
no
change
in
the
obstructure
of
this
market.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it’s
the
same
as
it
was
before
with
four
or
five
or
whatever
number
it
is.
but
although
the
structure
of
the
market
hasn’t
change,
the
structure
surrounding
the
market
has
changed
because
the
one
on
the
outside
when
they
come
in
has
been
eliminated.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
mr.
justice,
we
think
that
congress
in
section
7
has
made
the
judgment
that
you
cannot
justify
an
acquisition
coming
into
a
market
in
the
normal
situation
on
the
claim
that
you
will
be
able
to
compete
more
effectively
against
the
large
bank.
we
think
if
it
all
the
claim
that
the
new
bank
will
be
a
more
effective
competitor
in
the
market
is
what
congress
intended
to
be
studied
under
the
convenience
and
needs
defense,
but
that
that
is,
we
think
is
a
relevant
factor
in
determining
the
initial
threshold
question
whether
there
has
been
anticompetitive
effects.
and
as
we
develop
in
our
brief
and
i
hope
to
get
to,
we
think
in
this
case
that
the
so-called
benefits,
so-called
benefits,
which
the
district
court
found
this
merger
would
bring
to
the
city
of
spokane,
those
benefits
we
do
not
think
constitute
the
kind
of
benefits
that
congress
intended
to
recognize.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
mr.
justice
because
the
stress
of
section
7
is
on
the
long-term
picture,
on
the
long-term
picture.
initially,
it
may
well
be
that
a
bank
coming
in
substituting
itself
for
a
somewhat
weaker
back,
may
produce
an
immediate
floury
of
competition,
a
little
more
competitive.
but
in
the
long
run,
in
the
long
run
we
think,
it’s
anticompetitive
because
it
stills
a
concentrated
market
and
you’ve
lost
one
of
the
significant
potentials
for
deconcentration.
i
may
add
in
this
case,
this
is
not
a
case
of
the
acquiring
bank
coming
in
because
the
acquired
bank
is
weak
or
floundering.
this
is
a
successful,
very
prosperous,
good
bank.
it’s
a
large
bank.
it’s
a
bank
that’s
roughly
$100
million
to
claim
here
is
defy
the
larger
bank
coming
in,
it
will
enable
the
new
bank
to
provide
certain
specialized
services
which,
because
of
its
smaller
size,
it’s
not
been
able
to
provide.
services,
which
i
might
add,
are
available
in
spokane
through
other
banks
already
in
the
market.
and
we
think
that
that
kind
of
benefit
is
not
enough
to
justify
this
merger.
the
whole
purpose
of
section
7
is
to
try
to
stop
the
increases
in
concentration,
to
try
stop
these
what
congress
believed
to
be
deleterious
friends
in
the
economy,
and
banking
itself
unfortunately
tends
to
be
concentrated.
banking
tends
to
be
concentrated.
most
cities
except
perhaps
with
city
like
new
york,
we
have
a
large
number
of
banks,
you
find
that
banking
is
concentrated,
and
this,
it
seems
to
us,
is
all
the
more
important
in
banking
to
preserve
the
possibility
of
deconcentration
resulting
from
the
entrant
of
a
potential
competitor,
a
strong,
significant,
powerful
firm
that
seeks
together
into
the
market.
we
think
that’s
the
whole
purpose
that
congress
had
when
it
amended
section
7
in
1950
in
order
to
strengthen
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not
in
spokane
mr.
justice,
but
let
me
explain
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice
for
the
reason
that
under
state
law,
a
bank
that
has
its
headquarters
in
one
city
is
not
permitted
to
branch
outside
of
that
city
or
the
county
where
its
headquarter
is
or
into
an
incorporated
village
that
does
not
have
a
bank.
we
do
not
have
in
the
city
of
spokane
any
history
of
de
novo
branching.
we
have
one
bank
that
was
found
in
the
1955,
but
what
we
do
have
mr.
justice,
what
we
do
have
is
a
history
in
the
state
of
washington
of
a
practice
by
banks
of
sponsoring
banks,
assisting
in
their
organization,
helping
them
get
started
and
then
subsequently
acquire
them.
we
do
have
that
practice.
we
do
have
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there’s
a
dispute
to
that.
the
appellees
contend
that
the
practice
is
illegal.
we
think
it
is
legal.
let
me
just
briefly
--
i
will
come
to
it
later.
let
me
just
briefly
refer
to
what
the
practice
has
been
and
what
the
record
shows.
one
of
the
banks
in
washington,
the
fifth
largest
bank,
the
old
national
bank,
itself
has
assisted
in
the
organization
of
five
banks,
which
it
subsequently
acquired.
and
according
to
the
deposition
of
a
mr.
witherspoon,
who
is
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
the
old
national
bank,
they
assisted
and
sponsored
these
banks
and
i
would
quote
“with
the
hope
and
belief
that
we
would
be
able
to
acquire
them
in
the
future
and
make
branches
of
the
old
national
there.”
and
that’s
at
page
608
of
the
record.
he
also
stated
in
his
deposition
that
they
had
informed
the
comptroller
of
what
they
intended
to
do,
the
way
he
described
it
as
the
informer
comptroller
of
their
efforts
to
establish
branches
by
this
means.
that’s
at
page
610.
and
when
he
was
asked
to
the
comptroller
object
to
this,
he
said
on
the
contrary,
in
one
instance
it
was
the
comptroller,
that
is,
rather
the
assistance
comptroller
in
the
presence
of
the
comptroller
who
suggested
that
they
follow
this
practice.
and
in
subsequently
approving
merges
of
banks
in
the
state
of
washington
between
the
sponsoring
bank
and
the
sponsored
bank
the
comptroller
has
recognized
that
the
bank
did
play
this
role.
now,
the
acquiring
bank
in
this
case,
the
national
bank
of
commerce,
itself
on
one
occasion
sponsored
a
bank
in
the
so-called
columbia
shopping
center.
now,
the
claim
is
that
they
had
no
intention
of
ever
acquiring
it.
well,
this
record
shows
that
from
months
on
end,
a
number
of
important
officials
of
the
national
bank
of
commerce
were
concerned
with
all
the
details
of
this
bank.
they
aided
and
they
found
help
find
the
manager
for
the
bank.
on
one
occasion,
the
board
of
directors
of
the
national
bank
of
commerce
personally
selected
a
man
who
subsequently
declined
the
post
to
be
the
president
of
this
new
bank,
and,
as
they
say,
they
say
“well,
we
hope
to
be
able
to
acquire
the
bank”.
and
it
seems
to
us
in
the
light
of
this,
it’s
much
more
than
they
hope.
they
obviously
anticipated
that
they
would
be
able
to
do
that.
on
another
occasion,
there’s
an
internal
memorandum
in
which,
in
1971,
the
director
of
marketing
research
for
the
national
bank
of
commerce
suggested
to
an
assistant
vice
president
of
the
bank
that
perhaps
i
might
spoke
the
word
he
used
was
“sponsor”
a
bank
in
another
smaller
city
in
oregon,
pullman
and
that’s
shown
in
the
record.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
has
not
yet
come
to
past?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
no
waiting
period
with
respect
to
federally
chartered
banks
with
respect
to
state
chartered
banks,
there
is
a
requirement
that
accept
with
the
consent
of
the
state
superintendent
of
banking,
“no
bank
can
sell
any
of
its
shares
that
controlling
it
for
ten
years
from
the
time
of
acquisition”.
but
the
normal
theory
of
this
is
that
we
concede
that
you
could
not,
under
state
law,
form
and
sponsor
banks
solely
for
the
purpose
of
acquiring
it
or
with
an
expressed
intention,
expressed
understanding
or
agreement
to
do
so.
the
way
it’s
done
that
the
bank
and
sponsor
that
has
to
be
on
its
own
two
feet;
it
has
to
get
going
and
at
that
point
then
the
acquisition
takes
place.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
wouldn’t
say
conceal,
i
wouldn’t
conceal
mr.
justice.
what
i
would
suggest
is
that
this
is
a
recognized
technique
in
the
state
of
washington
by
which
banks
get
into
markets
where
they
are
not
directly
permitted.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
could
not
tell
you
--
i
couldn’t
tell
you
exactly
that.
the
record
shows
i
think
for
between
1960
and
1967,
there
were
i
believe
14
banks
acquired
in
the
state
of
washington.
i
don’t
know
that
the
record
shows
which
of
those
were
sponsored
and
subsequently
quo.
we
do
know,
we
do
know
mr.
justice
however,
that
at
least
five
banks
that
were
sponsored
by
the
old
national
bank
were
subsequently
acquired
by
that
bank
in
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
am
sorry.
your
question
is
you
mean
there’s
no
question
that
the
existing
organization
does
organize
the
bank?
oh
yes,
there’s
no
question
about
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
the
organization
of
bringing
a
new
competitor
in.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
there
is
not
question
for
that,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i’m
not
certain
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
provides
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
one
new
bank
that
i
know.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
started
from
scratch.
this
is
something
called
the
american
commercial
bank
and
this
is
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
1955
and
this
is
one
of
the
banks
as
i
will
come
to
--
that
we
think
was
available
as
a
toehold
entry
by
this
bank.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
this
new
banking
organization
--
in
fact,
this
banking
organization
now
has
four
branches
since
it
started
with
a
single
and
it’s
grown
and
now
it
has
four
branches
which
is
only
three
fewer
than
the
washington
trust
bank.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
think
if
the
newly
organized
unit
is
not
later
acquired,
you
don’t
--
and
it
maybe
more
difficult
to
say
that
the
putative
acquiring
bank
is
eliminated
as
a
substantial
competitor,
that
is
--
what
i
am
suggesting
is
if
it’s
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
the
new
back
is
--
once
the
new
bank
has
been
organized
and
once
the
new
bank
is
in
the
market,
that
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
a
competitor.
now,
that
fact
itself
of
course
does
not
necessarily
eliminate
the
sponsoring
bank
as
an
entrant
to
the
market
although
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
basic
problem
there,
i
suppose,
is
whether
the
market
would
stand
two
additional
banks.
in
other
words,
it
may
depending
again
on
its
relationship
--
ordinarily
the
relationship
is
one
would
expect
between
the
sponsoring
and
the
sponsored
bank
is
very
close.
they
normally
have
that
correspondent
relationships
and
stuff.
but
the
fact
is
that,
of
course,
this
does
inject
a
new
bank
into
the
market.
but
the
question
really,
it
seems
to
me,
is
whether
fairly
viewed,
if
the
acquiring
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
surely
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
surely
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
the
question
we
posed
is
on
what
basis
is
the
trial
court
to
decide
that
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right,
and
we
think
there
are
two
banks
in
the
market
that
it
could
have
acquired.
one
of
them
is
the
american
commercial
bank
which
we
has
been
discussing
that
was
organized
in
1965,
which
is
a
bank
with
15
million
in
deposits,
four
branches
in
the
city
of
spokane,
roughly
3%
of
the
market.
now,
the
reason
that
the
district
court
held
on
the
defendant’s
contend,
this
would
not
be
a
suitable
candidate
for
acquisition
is
that
under
the
ten-year
limitation
on
state
law,
and
this,
of
course,
is
the
state
organized
bank,
this
bank
would
not
be
available
for
acquisition
until
1975.
again,
my
answer
to
that
is
we
are
dealing
here
with
very
long
term
trends.
the
question
is
whether
if
the
national
bank
of
commerce
would
not
be
permitted
to
go
under
the
market
through
this
merger,
is
it
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
they
would
have
found
some
other
way
to
go
in?
now,
and
in
addition
to
this
other
bank,
there’s
another
bank
the
farmers
&
merchants
bank
which
is
a
little
smaller
that
it
has
three
offices.
these
of
course
are
offices
in
the
suburbs
and
the
interest
of
the
national
bank
of
washington
in
this
bank,
i
think
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
shortly
before
the
merger,
they
were
discussing
a
possible
acquisition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no
mr.
justice,
no
mr.
justice.
our
position
is
that
the
--
we
do
not
oppose,
we
do
not
oppose,
the
entry
by
large
statewide
banks
into
local
and
regional
banking
markets,
but
we
say
those
--
that
entry
should
take
place
in
the
least
anticompetitive
way
and
we
think
an
entry,
if
they
had
acquired
--
attempted
to
acquire
this
bank
with
only
3%
of
the
market,
we
would
have
view
that
as
a
so-called
permissible
toehold
acquisition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
the
district
court
did
not
find
mr.
justice,
the
district
court
did
not
find
that
this
was
no
difference
than
a
toehold
acquisition.
the
district
court
did
not
--
and
i
think
at
some
point
the
matter
of
decree
becomes
a
matter
of
quality,
but
it’s
not
just
quantity,
because
when
they
acquire
a
bank
with
22%
of
the
market,
that
to
us
is
a
very
different
thing
from
acquiring
a
bank
with
3%
of
the
market.
they
acquire
back
with
3%
of
the
market,
they’re
not
going
to
be
satisfied,
it
seems
to
me,
a
bank
like
the
national
bank
of
commerce,
coming
into
spokane
with
3%
of
the
market
and
setting
there
with
3%
of
the
market.
they’re
going
to
compete
as
vigorously
as
possible
and
attempt
to
get
into
that
market
and
to
expend
their
share
of
the
market.
whereas
if
all
they
do
is
acquire
this
22%
share
there
in
the
typical
situation
where
you
have
a
small
number,
three
in
these
case
of
the
bank
with
92%
of
the
market.
what
you
have
is
you
have
the
same
basic
structure
inside
the
market
and
you
don’t
have
the
same
kind
of
incentive
to
compete
to
be
--
to
bring
and
inject
some
new
vigor
into
the
market
to
possibly
deconcentrate
the
market
that
you
would
have
if
they
came
in
by
acquiring
a
small
bank,
a
bank
with
a
very
small
share
which
would
be
the
basis
for
growing.
now,
let
me
turn
to
something
else
which
is
we
have
been
discussing
how
they
get
in.
i
think
it’s
important
to
find
out
is
that
the
sort
of
thing
they
would
likely
to
do,
that
they
want
to
get
in
to
spokane.
how
important
was
it
to
this
bank
to
get
into
spokane,
so
that
if
they
were
unable,
if
they
were
unable
to
get
in
by
making
this
large
acquisition,
they
do
everything
they
could
to
get
in
by
some
on
to
that.
we
think
there
is
no
question
about
that,
that
this
is
one
of
the
things
that
the
national
bank
of
commerce
has
wanted
to
do
for
a
long,
long
time.
to
begin
with,
although
the
national
bank
of
commerce
is
the
second
largest
bank
in
the
state,
it’s
the
only
one
bank
that
is
represented
in
only
one
of
the
four
largest
cities.
it
is
represented
only
in
seattle.
it
is
not
represented
in
spokane,
the
second
largest
tacoma
or
everett,
the
next
three
largest
cities
in
the
state.
the
parties
to
this
case
stipulated
that
representation
in
spokane
has
been
a
long
sort
goal
of
nbc.
that’s
at
367
of
the
record.
the
former
president
of
the
national
bank
of
commerce
who
is
now
the
president
of
marine
bancorporation,
which
is
the
bank
holding
company
that
has
all
of
the
stock
of
the
bank,
stated
that
his
bank
has
been
interested
in
getting
into
spokane
for
a
long,
long
time.
he
said
since
prior
to
1933,
roughly
more
than
40
years.
he
explained
in
the
deposition
that
it
was
important
for
the
national
bank
of
spokane
to
get
in
there
because
all
of
the
other
major
banks
are
represented
there,
and
he
said
we
feel
there’s
business
available
to
us
in
spokane
if
we
are
represented
there,
that’s
at
page
139
of
the
record.
and
similarly
in
the
--
its
1970
report
to
stockholders,
the
holding
company
in
commenting
on
this
merger
said
that
this
finally
brought
the
national
bank
of
commerce
“within
sight
of
one
of
its
long
sort
goals
representation
in
the
city
of
spokane.”
that’s
at
page
1270
of
the
record.
and
indeed
in
a
brief
filed
with
the
comptroller
in
support
of
this
merger,
a
so-called
economic
brief,
discussing
the
economics
of
the
area
and
probably
the
economics
of
the
merger
itself,
what
the
bank
said
was
and
i
quote
again
from
page
1743
that
“if
commerce
is
to
maintain
its
present
relative
position
with
its
competitors
and
maintain
the
business
of
its
major
national
customers,
commerce
must
have
representation
in
spokane.”
“must”
was
the
words
they
used,
not
that
they
like
to,
not
they
thought
it
was
so,
they
must
have
representation
in
spokane.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes,
and
one
example
i
suppose
mr.
justice,
one
example,
was
their
attempt
shortly
before
this
merger
took
place
to
purchase
the
stock
of
the
american
commercial.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice,
i
didn’t
make
my
self
clear.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we’re
not
suggesting
there
is
anything
wrong.
in
fact,
it’s
quite
understandable
and
quite
appropriate
for
this
bank
to
want
to
get
into
the
spokane
market.
what
we
are
arguing
is
the
fact
that
this
bank
was
so
anxious
and
felt
it’s
so
important
to
get
into
spokane
is
clear
indication
and
shows
that
it
would
have
done
everything
it
could
to
try
to
get
in
by
these
alternative
means
if
it
were
not
permitted
to
go
in
by
acquiring
this
large
bank
in
the
market
now.
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
has
been
some
reference
by
mr.
moen
to
the
testimony
of
the
president
of
the
columbia
bank,
the
bank
that
was
sponsored
in,
and
we
referred
to
the
columbia
bank
not
that
that’s
a
way
of
getting
into
spokane,
but
to
show,
to
show
that
this
is
a
method
by
which
banks
do
enter
markets
where
they
are
not
permitted
directly
to
branch.
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
two
documents
in
the
record.
the
first
is
at
page
1514
of
the
record.
it’s
a
letter
from
mr.
buck,
who
was
the
senior
vice
president
of
the
national
bank
of
commerce
to
a
mr.
looney.
mr.
looney
was
an
attorney
in
the
area
where
the
columbia
bank
was
being
formed
who
became
--
he
had
done
some
work
for
the
branch
of
the
national
bank
of
commerce
in
this
area
and
he
ultimately
became
the
chairman
of
the
board
of
the
new
bank.
so,
he
was
the
man
who
was
intimately
concerned
in
the
formation
of
the
bank
and
understanding
what
was
happening.
now,
two
paragraphs
i’d
like
to
refer
to.
the
first
is
in
the
middle
of
that
page.
at
1514
he
said
that
there’s
been
no
--mr.
bulk
said,
there
has
been
no
written
or
oral
agreement
or
understanding
with
respect
to
acquisition
of
the
proposed
bank.
on
advice
of
counsel,
we
have
been
extremely
perhaps
excessively
cautious
to
avoid
this.
it
is
true
nevertheless
that
our
bank
has
inspired
submission
of
the
application
and
is
hopeful
that
in
appropriate
future
time,
it
will
possible
to
acquire
the
bank
for
incorporation
within
its
present
system.
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
i
pointed
out
that
the
way
the
bank
was
being
arranged,
the
majority
stock
will
be
in
hands
friendly
to
the
national
bank
of
commerce.
in
order
to
insure
as
much
as
possible
its
future
as
a
branch
of
that
bank,
it
avoids
certain
legal
problems,
which
could
arise
if
we
were
to
agree
or
contract
with
respect
to
its
acquisition.
then
at
page
1573
is
a
letter
from
mr.
looney
back
to
mr.
buck
written
a
few
months
later
and
these
letters
were
all
contemporaneously
written
at
the
time
the
columbia
bank
was
being
organized.
and
what
mr.
looney
said
to
mr.
buck
at
the
bottom
of
page
1513
is
“we
need
a
clear
definition
in
understanding
of
the
management
responsibilities
as
between
the
directors
of
the
unit
bank
and
the
management
of
the
national
bank
of
commerce.”
that’s
between
the
bank
that
was
sponsoring
and
the
bank
that
was
sponsored.
for
example,
many
of
the
steps
taken
initially
will
have
a
barring
on
the
long
range
operation
of
the
bank
many
years
after
it
has
changed
from
a
unit
bank
to
a
branch
bank.
now,
this
seems
to
us
to
indicate
very
clearly
that
the
whole
purpose
of
this
arrangement
was
ultimately
to
permit
the
national
bank
of
commerce
to
acquire
it.
now
mr.
loevinger
has
suggested
that
because
the
authorization
of
the
regulatory
authorities
is
needed
before
a
bank
can
enter
the
market.
if
the
regulatory
authorities
suggest,
they
would
not
charter
a
new
bank,
that’s
kind
of
the
end
of
a
thing.
well,
to
begin
with,
i
just
point
out
that
that
argument
of
course
has
no
application
to
the
possibility
of
entry
by
making
a
foothold
acquisition.
but
more
fundamentally,
it
seems
to
us
this
is
basically
not
the
scheme
of
section
7,
this
is
not
what
congress
did
not
intend
to
give
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
the
authority
to
veto,
the
authority
to
veto
that
the
enforcement
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
when
the
comptroller
says
that
he
does
not
think
it’s
likely
that
he
would
charter
a
new
bank,
to
begin
with
of
course,
his
testimony
is
given
in
defense
of
a
merger
that
he
is
already
approved.
but
more
importantly,
of
course,
the
regional
comptroller
only
makes
a
recommendation,
but
a
regional
official
may
think
today
he
is
not
going
to
charter
tomorrow
or
next
week
changes
may
occur.
and
we
do
believe
that
in
this
situation,
the
comptroller’s
view
that
he
would
not
permit
a
new
bank
to
be
charted
cannot
be
this
positive
on
this
question.
thank
you.
