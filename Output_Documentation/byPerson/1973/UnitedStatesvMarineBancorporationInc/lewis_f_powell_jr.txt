this
is
a
civil
antitrust
action
under
the
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
brought
here
on
appeal
from
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
washington.
the
issue
is
the
validity
of
a
proposed
merger
between
the
second
largest
banking
organization
in
a
state
based
in
seattle
and
the
eighth
largest
bank
located
in
spokane.
as
there
is
no
significant
direct
competition,
the
government
relies
exclusively
on
the
potential-competition
doctrine.
it
argues
best
that
the
acquiring
bank
would
probably
enter
spokane
de
novo
or
by
acquisition
of
a
smaller
bank
and,
thus,
would
have
assists
in
the
deconcentration
of
the
spokane
market.
and
second
that
the
merger
would
eliminate
the
acquiring
bank
as
a
potential
entrant,
which
presently
is
alleged
to
have
a
pro-competitive
affect
on
that
market.
the
district
court
found
no
violation
of
section
7
and
we
agree.
the
potential-competition
doctrine,
though
applicable
to
banks,
must
take
into
account
the
extensive
federal
and
state
regulation,
and
particularly
the
regulatory
restraints
on
entry
into
a
new
market.
the
barriers
to
entry
in
washington
are
severe.
de
novo
branching
is
forbidden,
as
is
branching
from
a
branch

not
all
multi
bank

allowed.
the
government
nevertheless
contended
that
entry
was
feasible,
either
by
acquisition
of
a
small
state
bank
or
by
achieving
an
informal
de
novo
entry
though
establishing
a
sponsored
bank
and
later
acquiring
it.
we
have
carefully
examined
the
record
in
this
case
and
conclude
in
accordance
with
the
findings
of
the
district
court
that
the
government
has
failed
to
establish
that
either
of
these
proposed
methods
of
entry
is
feasible
or
that
either
offers
a
substantial
likelihood
of
producing
pro-competitive
effects.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
