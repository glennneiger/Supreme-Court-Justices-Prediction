mr.
lee
loevinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
for
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
and
such
i
believe
i
speak
for
the
government.
normally
of
course
the
department
of
justice
speaks
for
the
government.
the
comptroller
however
is
an
order
agency
than
the
solicitor
general
of
the
antitrust
provision
and
indeed
older
than
the
antitrust
laws
themselves.
however,
that
is
not
the
basis
on
which
i
assert
this.
the
important
point
is
that
the
department
of
justice
in
these
cases
is
interested
only
in
protecting
a
single
element,
the
competitive
element,
and
of
course
with
the
antitrust
law
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
sir?
mr.
lee
loevinger
statutory,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
don’t
have
the
statute
at
hand
mr.
justice,
but
it
is
our
statutory
authority
of
the
comptroller
to
appear
in
these
cases
and
as
such
he
represents
the
interest
of
the
government
embodied
in
both
the
banking
and
the
antitrust
laws
as
i
shall
hope
to
demonstrate
the
comptroller
is
interested
not
simply
in
banking
interest
but
also
in
competitive
interest
and
therefore
represents
the
entire
public
interest
which
i
believe
is
the
viewpoint
of
the
government
and
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
perhaps
sir.
in
any
event,
i
have
six
substantive
points
that
i
hope
to
make.
i
shall
appear
twice
and
i
hope
to
be
able
to
get
to
them.
i
will
tell
you
what
they
are
and
then
proceed
to
them.
first,
the
plaintiff’s
argument
is
basically
circular
in
question
begging,
because
it
assumes
that
section
7
requires
the
banking
agencies
to
permit
de
novo
entry.
second,
section
7
does
not
supersede
the
federal
banking
statutes
as
plaintiff
somewhat
explicitly
and
certainly
implicitly
contends.
third,
potential
competition
does
not
have
the
same
application
to
banking
as
to
one
regulated
industries.
fourth,
the
plaintiff’s
sponsorship
scheme
does
not
only
illegal
dubious
means
of
--
legally
dubious
means
of
circumventing
state
law,
but
is
actually
anticompetitive
in
its
effect,
as
i
shall
demonstrate.
five,
section
7
does
not
forbid
a
merger,
which
lessens
potential
competition,
but
it
increases
actual
competition
in
the
relevant
market,
which
is
somewhat
different
in
the
question
left
open
in
falstaff.
and
finally,
the
plaintiff
would
rewrite
section
7
so
that
potentiality
attenuates
substantiality
to
triviality.
now
first,
the
plaintiff’s
argument
is
basically
circular
in
question
begging,
because
although
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
proving
the
violation
of
section
7,
not
depends
upon
proving
that
the
merger
would
probably
lessen
competition.
plaintiff
admits
there
is
no
actual
competition.
therefore,
the
theory
of
plaintiff
entirely
is
that
absent
a
merger,
the
acquiring
bank
here
would
enter
the
market
de
novo.
this
however
requires
the
permission
of
the
banking
authorities.
there
is
objective
evidence
that
this
permission
would
not
be
given.
plaintiff
attempts
to
surmount
this
barrier
by
assuming
that
administrative
permission
is
required.
thus,
in
the
brief
in
this
case
at
page
51,
plaintiff
says,
“it
must
be
assumed
that
the
regulatory
decision
will
reflect
the
national
policy
in
favor
of
market
extensions
by
internal
expansion
rather
than
not
by
acquisition.”
there
is
a
similar
statement
in
plaintiff’s
connecticut
brief
at
page
53.
thus,
plaintiff’s
entire
argument
is
based
upon
the
assumption
that
section
7
requires
the
permission
of
the
administrative
authorities
for
de
novo
entry
and
once
you
eliminate
that
assumption,
plaintiff
does
not
have
an
argument
on
potential
competition,
but
that
assumption
is
the
very
matter
to
be
proved.
it’s
the
very
question
and
issue
before
this
court.
therefore,
it’s
an
entirely
circular
and
question
of
begging
argument.
second,
plaintiff
in
effect
asserts
that
section
7
supersede
the
federal
banking
statutes.
plaintiff
clearly
argues
that
in
a
bank
merger
case
involving
potential
competition
that
section
7
standards
must
be
applied
at
page
52
of
the
brief
in
this
case,
plaintiff
asserts.
mr.
lee
loevinger
the
plaintiff
is
the
antitrust
division
under
the
department
of
justice
represented
by
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
lee
loevinger
that
is
a
formality
your
honor
in
a
sense,
the
court
is
the
united
states
of
america.
i
believe
this
court
represents
the
united
states
as
i
do
and
as
mr.
friedman
does.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir,
and
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
is
an
agency
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
mean
the
interest
represented
by
mr.
friedman
and
the
antitrust
division
sir.
i
don’t
really
wish
to
quarrel
with
the
court
about
this.
i
don’t
regarded
that
an
important
substantive
point.
i
think
it
is
somewhat
of
formality
but
i
think
it
helps
to
keep
the
matters
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
well
sir
the
comptroller
has
been
representing
the
united
states
of
america
since
about
1863,
which
is
long
before
sherman
act
was
passed.
so,
as
i
say
i
would
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
don’t
know.
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice
i
can’t
argue
that.
i
can’t
discuss
that
question.
i
would
if
you
will
permit
me
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
may
i
proceed
with
my
argument
mr.
justice?
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
department’s
position
is
that
section
7,
in
effect,
supersedes
the
federal
banking
statutes.
does
it
--
page
52
of
the
washington
brief
says
only
if
new
entry
might
threaten
the
stability
of
the
existing
banks,
could
the
comptroller
properly
permit
--
properly
refuse
to
permit
new
competition.
now
and
again,
this
is
repeated
in
other
briefs,
and
in
the
plaintiff’s
reply
brief
and
connecticut
that
argues
that
the
appropriate
number
of
banks
is
not
to
be
determined
by
administrator
or
judicial
fiat,
but
by
the
market,
through
the
processes
of
competition.
one
wonders
if
the
same
statement
would
be
made
about
the
icc,
the
cab
and
the
fcc.
but
in
any
event
this
is
not
the
law.
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank’s
case,
this
court
speaking
of
mr.
justice
brennan
said
and
i
quote
it
“a
charter
for
a
new
bank,
state
or
national,
will
not
be
granted
unless
he
invested
capital
and
management
of
the
applicant
of
his
prospects
for
doing
sufficient
business
to
operate
at
a
reasonable
profit,
if
adequate
protection
against
undo
competition
and
possible
failure.”
now
there
is
no
such
policy
--
no
such
policy
embodied
in
the
antitrust
laws.
that
is
strictly
a
banking
standard.
this
rule
was
not
changed
by
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
and
in
the
third
national
bank
of
nashville
that
this
court
said,
the
purpose
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
66
was
to
permit
certain
bank
mergers
even
though
they
tended
to
lessen
competition.
congress
felt
that
the
role
of
banks
in
a
community’s
economic
life
was
such
that
the
public
interest
would
sometimes
to
be
reserve
by
a
bank
merger,
even
though
the
lessens
competition.
mr.
lee
loevinger
if
that
the
--
apparently
the
court
said
that
the
basic
competitive
analysis
was
to
be
made
first,
then
the
public
interest
was
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
competitive
analysis
as
balanced
against
the
other
interest.
however,
as
i
shall,
point
out
what
happens
in
a
potential
merger
cases
to
merge
that
you
don’t
have
to
clean
cut
kind
of
dichotomy
that
you
do
in
an
actual
competition
case
where
first
you
see
that
competition
is
being
extinguished.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
very
simple,
is
that
in
a
potential
competition
case
which
you
are
talking
about
is
potential
entry.
but
there
is
no
potential
entry
unless
there
is
a
community
need
and
service
to
the
community
convenience
by
that
entry.
therefore,
before
there
can
be
a
potential
entry
or
a
probable
entry,
as
this
court
has
held,
there
must
be
a
showing
of
the
convenience
and
needs
argument
consequently
in
a
potential
competition
case.
it
seems
to
me
as
a
matter
of
logic
that
the
department
has
the
burden
of
meeting
both
sides
of
the
equation.
it
may
have
to
show
both
that
there
is
a
--
well,
they
don’t
even
get
the
competition
until
they
have
dealt
with
community
needs,
because
without
community
need
and
probable
entry
there
is
no
potential
competition.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no
sir,
that
would
be
true
of
both
national
and
state
banks
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
philadelphia
case
because
the
standards
are
essentially
similar.
there
are
some
differences.
now
potential
--
and
this
is
the
reason
why
i
say
that
potential
competition
theory
does
not
have
the
same
application
to
banking
as
to
regulated
industries.
the
purpose
of
regulating
and
limiting
the
entry
into
the
banking
field
is
to
protect
the
public
interest
in
bank
functioning
and
bank
solvency,
as
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
a
bank
failure
is
a
community
disaster.
we
cited
in
our
brief
from
mr.
paul
samuels,
economist
about
bank
failures.
bank
failures
are
not
all
together
a
thing
of
the
past,
although
they
have
been
largely
minimized.
only
last
october,
one
of
the
largest
bank
failures
in
the
history
of
the
company
of
u.s.,
the
national
bank
in
san
diego
a
billion
dollar
bank
failure.
there
had
been
some
bank
closings
every
year
since
1934.
there
had
been
635
bank
closings
because
of
financial
difficulties.
the
fbic
now
has
156
banks
on
its
problems
list.
the
entry
into
banking
requires
a
showing
of
community
need,
of
prospective
profitability,
and
of
other
factors
subject
to
judgment
by
administrative
expertise.
furthermore,
even
the
perceived
entry
as
distinguished
from
the
actual
entry
which
justice
--
mr.
justice
marshall
distinguished
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
falstaff
is
different
in
banking.
because
in
an
ordinary
industry,
the
contending
and
competing
units
must
look
at
those
standing
on
the
fringes
to
see
whether
economic
factors
are
likely
to
move
them
into
the
market.
however,
in
banking
if
one
of
those
standing
on
the
fringes
wants
to
enter
the
market,
he
must
make
application
to
an
administrative
agency
without
exceptions
state
or
national
and
the
banks
in
the
market
have
an
opportunity
to
go
in
and
to
be
heard
and
to
oppose
the
entry
of
the
new
entrant.
consequently,
there
is
no
unperceived
entry;
there
is
no
unperceived
potential
entrant
in
banking
as
there
may
be
in
other
cases.
furthermore,
the
determination
of
the
propriety
of
the
organization
of
a
new
bank
and
its
entry
into
the
market,
this
court
has
said
is
specifically
a
matter
for
determination
by
the
banking
agencies.
and
therefore,
i
submit,
it
is
not
appropriate
for
determination
in
the
case
such
as
the
present
one
and
what
the
national
bank
versus
new
orleans
case
which
is
a
very
complicated
case
explained
at
page
55
of
the
marine
bank
brief.
basically
in
order
to
avoid
the
restrictions
of
state
laws
to
branching,
to
form
the
bank
holding
company
as
the
department
would
have
the
defendant
banks
do
hear
and
it
organize
a
new
bank.
there
was
a
litigation
below,
which
resulted
in
an
injunction
against
the
bank
charter
being
issued.
when
the
case
came
to
this
court,
this
court
held
that
the
lower
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
to
pass
upon
that
question
and
remanded
the
matter
to
the
federal
reserve
or
the
banking
agency
in
that
case
saying,
we
have
concluded
that
district
court
that
it
is
the
exclusive
function
of
the
federal
reserve
board
to
act
in
such
cases.
in
cases
raising
issues
of
fact
not
within
the
conventional
experience
of
judges
or
cases
requiring
the
exercise
of
administrative
discretion,
agencies
created
by
congress
for
regulating
subject
matter
should
not
be
passed
over.
therefore,
we
submit
that
this
court
should
not,
by
and
grafting
the
potential
competition
theory
of
the
section
7
and
then
applying
that
to
banking,
pass
over
the
expertise
of
the
banking
agencies
as
to
who
and
when
there
should
be
entry
into
the
banking
field,
which
is
what
potential
competition
means,
potential
entry.
now
let
me
say
a
word
about
the
sponsorship
scheme
proposed
by
the
department.
it
is
true
as
my
colleague
mr.
moen
has
said
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
ambiguity
about
the
use
of
this
term
sponsorship.
in
fact,
there
is
evidence
that
banking
executives
like
others
in
other
businesses,
sometimes
help
new
institutions
that
they
give
advice.
old
lawyers
do
this
to
young
lawyers.
this
is
not
an
unknown
procedure.
however,
sponsorship
as
used
in
this
case
by
the
department
of
justice
means
and
i
think
must
mean
if
it
is
to
have
significance
that
contribution
of
capital
and
the
holding
of
some
sort
of
a
significant
legal
entrance
in
the
bank,
but
it
doesn’t
mean
that
it
means
nothing.
anybody
can
go
and
get
fringe.
i
suppose
i
could
go
down
and
ask
my
friendly
banker
how
i
go
about
organizing
a
bank.
however,
in
the
first
place
this
method,
if
approved
by
this
court,
would
be
available
only
to
national
banks.
there
is
no
contention
that
mr.
friedman
has
conceded.
it
wouldn’t
be
available
state
banks.
this
immediately
would
destroy
the
competitive
equality
between
national
and
state
banks
which
congress
clearly
intended,
as
this
court
has
often
said
in
cases
cited
in
our
brief.
second
place,
this
would
undermine
the
dual
banking
system
and
handicap
the
state
banks
by
giving
the
federal
banks
a
technique
not
available
to
state
banks.
2/3
of
all
the
commercial
banks
in
the
country
today
are
state
banks,
only1/3
are
national.
they
happen
to
be
the
larger
banks
but
this
would
give
the
advantage
to
the
national
banks.
further,
at
best,
this
scheme
is
expensive,
difficult,
and
risky
unless
available
not
only
--
not
to
all
banks
but
only
to
the
larger
banks.
it
is
clear
from
the
records
here
that
the
cost
of
forming
a
holding
company
and
organizing
a
bank
is
upwards
of
$2
million.
the
statutory
minimum
is
a-million-and-a-half
dollars.
however,
of
all
the
commercial
banks
in
the
united
states,
25%
are
under
5
million
in
deposits;
48%
under
10
million;
and
78%
under
25
million,
both
state
and
federal.
and
i
submit
that
as
a
practical
matter,
this
is
a
method
that
would
be
available
really
only
to
the
top
5%
of
the
banks
in
the
united
states.
furthermore,
this
scheme
would
endanger
new
and
small
banks
by
offering
and
threatening
undue
competition.
this
appears
in
the
record
in
the
present
case
at
page
1034.
the
court
asked
the
department
of
justice
counsel
and
i
quote,
“your
theory
is
that
if
a
new
bank
went
in
there,
spokane,
they
would
take
some
deposits
from
the
other
banks
and
therefore
the
other
banks
wouldn’t
make
as
much
money
and
therefore
would
increase
competition,
is
that
your
theory?”
and
the
department
counsel
said
“yes
sir.”
in
other
words,
new
and
small
banks
are
likely
to
be
the
victim
of
this
procedure.
these
are
the
ones
that
are
owned
and
by
small
business
and
by
the
minority
groups
that
are
struggling
for
recognition
today.
these
are
the
ones
that
are
protected
by
the
bank
regulatory
agencies.
under
plaintiff’s
theory
there
would
be
no
protection.
consequently,
if
the
plaintiff’s
sponsorship
scheme
were
approved
by
this
court,
this
would
insure
growth
by
the
largest
banks.
it
would
insure
the
foreclosure
of
markets
to
small
and
medium
size
banks
and
it
would
probably
lead
to
the
failure
of
small
banks
and
thus
ultimately
to
the
much
greater
concentration
of
banking
business
in
the
united
states.
now
fifth,
section
7
does
not
forbid
a
merger,
which
lessens
potential
competition
but
increases
actual
competition
in
the
relevant
market.
i
trust
i
need
not
point
out
that
the
court
did
in
falstaff.
that
the
courts
opinion
said
that
the
question
left
open
was
whether
a
new
entry
that
neither
help
nor
hurt
competition
was
illegal
merely
because
the
acquiring
company
could
but
did
not
entered
de
novo.
that
question
is
not
reached
here
because
in
both
cases,
there
is
evidence
that
here
the
entry
will
make
the
market
more
competitive.
the
court
found
in
this
case,
this
merger
will
make
the
spokane
market
even
more
competitive
as
it
will
replace
a
bank
with
a
limited
competitive
ability
with
one
with
greater
capacity
to
provide
loans
and
it
will
remove
its
competitive
disadvantage.
now,
plaintiff,
in
effect,
answers
this
by
saying
that
to
the
extent
the
court
relied
on
the
theory
the
merger
would
replace
washington
trust
with
the
bank
able
to
compete
more
effectively
that
these
are
factors
to
be
considered
on
the
community
needs
and
convenience
defense
and
not
in
asserting
the
competitive
impact
of
the
merger.
if
i
may
be
disrespectful,
i
say
nonsense,
to
say
that
an
increase
in
competition
cannot
be
considered
in
appraising
the
competitive
impact
simply
doesn’t
make
sense
under
the
antitrust
laws
or
under
any
other
laws.
in
fact,
justice
marshall
in
concurring
in
falstaff
said
that
if
a
company
would
have
remained
outside
the
market
but
to
the
possibility
of
entry
by
acquisition
and
if
it
is
exerting
no
influence
as
a
perceived
potential
entrant,
then
there
will
normally
be
no
competitive
loss
when
it
enters
by
acquisition.
indeed,
there
may
even
be
a
competitive
gain
to
the
extent
that
it
strengthens
the
market
position
of
the
acquired
firm,
which
is
exactly
the
case
here.
furthermore,
in
brown
shoe,
this
court
said,
congress
recognized
the
stimulation
to
competition
that
might
flow
from
particular
mergers.
when
concerned
as
to
the
act’s
breadth
was
expressed
supporters
the
amendment
indicated,
it
would
not
impede,
for
example,
a
merger
between
two
small
companies
to
enable
the
competition
to
compete
more
effectively
with
larger
corporations
dominating
the
relevant
market.
here
admittedly,
there
is
no
change
in
market
structure
or
concentration.
there
is
only
a
strengthening
of
one
competitor,
which
has
already
stimulated
new
competition
in
spokane
as
we
point
out
at
page
53
of
our
brief.
and
this
does
not
lessen
competition
but
increases
competition
which
is
the
purpose
of
section
7.
finally,
let
me
come
to
my
last
point,
last
former
point
and
then
i
will
now
or
later
answer
some
points
of
the
department
that
the
plaintiff
would
rewrite
section
7
so
that
potentiality
really
reduces
substantiality
to
triviality.
there
has
been
some
talk
as
to
what
potentiality
means,
and
mr.
friedman
has
candidly
said,
they’re
looking
at
very
long
range
effects.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
was
confirmed
by
a
speech
by
the
acting
deputy
assistant
attorney
general
the
antitrust
division
made
the
day
after
we
filed
our
brief
and
published
an
atrr
april
16,
1974.
it
is
number
699
at
pages
(d)
1
to
5
in
which
he
said
the
departments
concern
for
preserving
competition
is
premised
upon
the
belief
that
existing
market
structures
are
not
immutable
over
time.
changes
in
law,
technology,
business
philosophy
and
imperatives
of
the
market
place
may
result
in
future
market
entry
with
attended
increased
competition
in
a
manner,
which
would
not
have
been
predicted
at
an
earlier
time.
the
department’s
efforts,
he
candidly
states,
are
aimed
that
these
market
extension
cases,
which
involves
theories
of
potential
competition.
now
i
submit
that
to
say
that
potential
competition,
which
the
department
of
justice
is
now
protecting,
is
the
possibility
of
future
market
entry
in
some
presently
unpredictable
or
unforeseeable
manner,
is
to
say
that
we
are
dealing
with
something
that
is
improbable.
the
law
simply
cannot
deal
with
the
unpredictable
or
the
unforeseeable.
the
essence
of
legal
probability
is
foreseeability.
thus,
plaintiff
is
seeking
to
have
the
standard
of
proof
in
section
7
cases,
reduced
from
probability
and
substantiality
to
possibility
and
triviality.
plaintiff
asked
the
court
to
forbid
any
merger,
which
might
foreclose
any
unforeseeable
future
possibility
of
competition.
but
this
is
impossible
to
do
because
the
unforeseeable
we
simply
cannot
deal
with.
this
is
unreasonable,
unworkable,
unprecedented,
and
i
submit
a
formula
for
stagnation
not
competition.
furthermore,
in
my
brief
i
have
submitted
to
the
court
that
i
believe
that
this
standard,
if
it
becomes
established
in
the
law,
is
a
formula
that
will
threaten
civil
liberties.
the
brief
was
filed
april
8.
i
suggested
that
the
potential
enemies
in
authoritarian
countries
are
prosecuted
as
the
department
would
go
after
potential
competitors
here.
on
april
15,
the
week
after
we
filed
our
brief,
the
washington
star
news
published
a
little
item
saying
that
aleksandr
solzhenitsyn,
the
well
known
russian
author,
had
been
exiled
because,
it
was
said
by
a
leading
russian
spokesman,
as
he
was
guilty
of
making
“potentially
dangerous
proposals”.
they
said
that
he
was
accused
of
writing
utopian
and
potentially
dangerous
ideas.
now
this
is
the
language
of
authoritarianism.
this
is
the
doctrine
which
the
department
of
justice
would
have
this
court
accept
in
which
i
submit
if
accepted
in
these
cases
cannot
be
confined
of
these
cases.
if
we
--
if
potentiality
in
the
sense
of
unforeseeability,
unpredictability
that
which
cannot
be
really
met
by
present
proof,
cannot
be
dealt
with
on
the
basis
of
the
contemporary
record,
then
there
are
simply
no
standards.
there
is
no
way
that
we
can
deal
with
the
data
presented
with
the
evidence
if
the
court
is
going
to
permit
this
kind
of
proof.
my
time
is
up.
mr.
lee
loevinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
for
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
and
such
i
believe
i
speak
for
the
government.
normally
of
course
the
department
of
justice
speaks
for
the
government.
the
comptroller
however
is
an
order
agency
than
the
solicitor
general
of
the
antitrust
provision
and
indeed
older
than
the
antitrust
laws
themselves.
however,
that
is
not
the
basis
on
which
i
assert
this.
the
important
point
is
that
the
department
of
justice
in
these
cases
is
interested
only
in
protecting
a
single
element,
the
competitive
element,
and
of
course
with
the
antitrust
law
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
sir?
mr.
lee
loevinger
statutory,
your
honor.
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
don’t
have
the
statute
at
hand
mr.
justice,
but
it
is
our
statutory
authority
of
the
comptroller
to
appear
in
these
cases
and
as
such
he
represents
the
interest
of
the
government
embodied
in
both
the
banking
and
the
antitrust
laws
as
i
shall
hope
to
demonstrate
the
comptroller
is
interested
not
simply
in
banking
interest
but
also
in
competitive
interest
and
therefore
represents
the
entire
public
interest
which
i
believe
is
the
viewpoint
of
the
government
and
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
perhaps
sir.
in
any
event,
i
have
six
substantive
points
that
i
hope
to
make.
i
shall
appear
twice
and
i
hope
to
be
able
to
get
to
them.
i
will
tell
you
what
they
are
and
then
proceed
to
them.
first,
the
plaintiff’s
argument
is
basically
circular
in
question
begging,
because
it
assumes
that
section
7
requires
the
banking
agencies
to
permit
de
novo
entry.
second,
section
7
does
not
supersede
the
federal
banking
statutes
as
plaintiff
somewhat
explicitly
and
certainly
implicitly
contends.
third,
potential
competition
does
not
have
the
same
application
to
banking
as
to
one
regulated
industries.
fourth,
the
plaintiff’s
sponsorship
scheme
does
not
only
illegal
dubious
means
of
--
legally
dubious
means
of
circumventing
state
law,
but
is
actually
anticompetitive
in
its
effect,
as
i
shall
demonstrate.
five,
section
7
does
not
forbid
a
merger,
which
lessens
potential
competition,
but
it
increases
actual
competition
in
the
relevant
market,
which
is
somewhat
different
in
the
question
left
open
in
falstaff.
and
finally,
the
plaintiff
would
rewrite
section
7
so
that
potentiality
attenuates
substantiality
to
triviality.
now
first,
the
plaintiff’s
argument
is
basically
circular
in
question
begging,
because
although
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
proving
the
violation
of
section
7,
not
depends
upon
proving
that
the
merger
would
probably
lessen
competition.
plaintiff
admits
there
is
no
actual
competition.
therefore,
the
theory
of
plaintiff
entirely
is
that
absent
a
merger,
the
acquiring
bank
here
would
enter
the
market
de
novo.
this
however
requires
the
permission
of
the
banking
authorities.
there
is
objective
evidence
that
this
permission
would
not
be
given.
plaintiff
attempts
to
surmount
this
barrier
by
assuming
that
administrative
permission
is
required.
thus,
in
the
brief
in
this
case
at
page
51,
plaintiff
says,
“it
must
be
assumed
that
the
regulatory
decision
will
reflect
the
national
policy
in
favor
of
market
extensions
by
internal
expansion
rather
than
not
by
acquisition.”
there
is
a
similar
statement
in
plaintiff’s
connecticut
brief
at
page
53.
thus,
plaintiff’s
entire
argument
is
based
upon
the
assumption
that
section
7
requires
the
permission
of
the
administrative
authorities
for
de
novo
entry
and
once
you
eliminate
that
assumption,
plaintiff
does
not
have
an
argument
on
potential
competition,
but
that
assumption
is
the
very
matter
to
be
proved.
it’s
the
very
question
and
issue
before
this
court.
therefore,
it’s
an
entirely
circular
and
question
of
begging
argument.
second,
plaintiff
in
effect
asserts
that
section
7
supersede
the
federal
banking
statutes.
plaintiff
clearly
argues
that
in
a
bank
merger
case
involving
potential
competition
that
section
7
standards
must
be
applied
at
page
52
of
the
brief
in
this
case,
plaintiff
asserts.
mr.
lee
loevinger
the
plaintiff
is
the
antitrust
division
under
the
department
of
justice
represented
by
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
lee
loevinger
that
is
a
formality
your
honor
in
a
sense,
the
court
is
the
united
states
of
america.
i
believe
this
court
represents
the
united
states
as
i
do
and
as
mr.
friedman
does.
mr.
lee
loevinger
yes
sir,
and
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
is
an
agency
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
mean
the
interest
represented
by
mr.
friedman
and
the
antitrust
division
sir.
i
don’t
really
wish
to
quarrel
with
the
court
about
this.
i
don’t
regarded
that
an
important
substantive
point.
i
think
it
is
somewhat
of
formality
but
i
think
it
helps
to
keep
the
matters
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
well
sir
the
comptroller
has
been
representing
the
united
states
of
america
since
about
1863,
which
is
long
before
sherman
act
was
passed.
so,
as
i
say
i
would
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
don’t
know.
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice
i
can’t
argue
that.
i
can’t
discuss
that
question.
i
would
if
you
will
permit
me
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
may
i
proceed
with
my
argument
mr.
justice?
mr.
lee
loevinger
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
department’s
position
is
that
section
7,
in
effect,
supersedes
the
federal
banking
statutes.
does
it
--
page
52
of
the
washington
brief
says
only
if
new
entry
might
threaten
the
stability
of
the
existing
banks,
could
the
comptroller
properly
permit
--
properly
refuse
to
permit
new
competition.
now
and
again,
this
is
repeated
in
other
briefs,
and
in
the
plaintiff’s
reply
brief
and
connecticut
that
argues
that
the
appropriate
number
of
banks
is
not
to
be
determined
by
administrator
or
judicial
fiat,
but
by
the
market,
through
the
processes
of
competition.
one
wonders
if
the
same
statement
would
be
made
about
the
icc,
the
cab
and
the
fcc.
but
in
any
event
this
is
not
the
law.
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank’s
case,
this
court
speaking
of
mr.
justice
brennan
said
and
i
quote
it
“a
charter
for
a
new
bank,
state
or
national,
will
not
be
granted
unless
he
invested
capital
and
management
of
the
applicant
of
his
prospects
for
doing
sufficient
business
to
operate
at
a
reasonable
profit,
if
adequate
protection
against
undo
competition
and
possible
failure.”
now
there
is
no
such
policy
--
no
such
policy
embodied
in
the
antitrust
laws.
that
is
strictly
a
banking
standard.
this
rule
was
not
changed
by
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
and
in
the
third
national
bank
of
nashville
that
this
court
said,
the
purpose
of
the
bank
merger
act
of
66
was
to
permit
certain
bank
mergers
even
though
they
tended
to
lessen
competition.
congress
felt
that
the
role
of
banks
in
a
community’s
economic
life
was
such
that
the
public
interest
would
sometimes
to
be
reserve
by
a
bank
merger,
even
though
the
lessens
competition.
mr.
lee
loevinger
if
that
the
--
apparently
the
court
said
that
the
basic
competitive
analysis
was
to
be
made
first,
then
the
public
interest
was
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
competitive
analysis
as
balanced
against
the
other
interest.
however,
as
i
shall,
point
out
what
happens
in
a
potential
merger
cases
to
merge
that
you
don’t
have
to
clean
cut
kind
of
dichotomy
that
you
do
in
an
actual
competition
case
where
first
you
see
that
competition
is
being
extinguished.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
very
simple,
is
that
in
a
potential
competition
case
which
you
are
talking
about
is
potential
entry.
but
there
is
no
potential
entry
unless
there
is
a
community
need
and
service
to
the
community
convenience
by
that
entry.
therefore,
before
there
can
be
a
potential
entry
or
a
probable
entry,
as
this
court
has
held,
there
must
be
a
showing
of
the
convenience
and
needs
argument
consequently
in
a
potential
competition
case.
it
seems
to
me
as
a
matter
of
logic
that
the
department
has
the
burden
of
meeting
both
sides
of
the
equation.
it
may
have
to
show
both
that
there
is
a
--
well,
they
don’t
even
get
the
competition
until
they
have
dealt
with
community
needs,
because
without
community
need
and
probable
entry
there
is
no
potential
competition.
mr.
lee
loevinger
no
sir,
that
would
be
true
of
both
national
and
state
banks
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
philadelphia
case
because
the
standards
are
essentially
similar.
there
are
some
differences.
now
potential
--
and
this
is
the
reason
why
i
say
that
potential
competition
theory
does
not
have
the
same
application
to
banking
as
to
regulated
industries.
the
purpose
of
regulating
and
limiting
the
entry
into
the
banking
field
is
to
protect
the
public
interest
in
bank
functioning
and
bank
solvency,
as
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
a
bank
failure
is
a
community
disaster.
we
cited
in
our
brief
from
mr.
paul
samuels,
economist
about
bank
failures.
bank
failures
are
not
all
together
a
thing
of
the
past,
although
they
have
been
largely
minimized.
only
last
october,
one
of
the
largest
bank
failures
in
the
history
of
the
company
of
u.s.,
the
national
bank
in
san
diego
a
billion
dollar
bank
failure.
there
had
been
some
bank
closings
every
year
since
1934.
there
had
been
635
bank
closings
because
of
financial
difficulties.
the
fbic
now
has
156
banks
on
its
problems
list.
the
entry
into
banking
requires
a
showing
of
community
need,
of
prospective
profitability,
and
of
other
factors
subject
to
judgment
by
administrative
expertise.
furthermore,
even
the
perceived
entry
as
distinguished
from
the
actual
entry
which
justice
--
mr.
justice
marshall
distinguished
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
falstaff
is
different
in
banking.
because
in
an
ordinary
industry,
the
contending
and
competing
units
must
look
at
those
standing
on
the
fringes
to
see
whether
economic
factors
are
likely
to
move
them
into
the
market.
however,
in
banking
if
one
of
those
standing
on
the
fringes
wants
to
enter
the
market,
he
must
make
application
to
an
administrative
agency
without
exceptions
state
or
national
and
the
banks
in
the
market
have
an
opportunity
to
go
in
and
to
be
heard
and
to
oppose
the
entry
of
the
new
entrant.
consequently,
there
is
no
unperceived
entry;
there
is
no
unperceived
potential
entrant
in
banking
as
there
may
be
in
other
cases.
furthermore,
the
determination
of
the
propriety
of
the
organization
of
a
new
bank
and
its
entry
into
the
market,
this
court
has
said
is
specifically
a
matter
for
determination
by
the
banking
agencies.
and
therefore,
i
submit,
it
is
not
appropriate
for
determination
in
the
case
such
as
the
present
one
and
what
the
national
bank
versus
new
orleans
case
which
is
a
very
complicated
case
explained
at
page
55
of
the
marine
bank
brief.
basically
in
order
to
avoid
the
restrictions
of
state
laws
to
branching,
to
form
the
bank
holding
company
as
the
department
would
have
the
defendant
banks
do
hear
and
it
organize
a
new
bank.
there
was
a
litigation
below,
which
resulted
in
an
injunction
against
the
bank
charter
being
issued.
when
the
case
came
to
this
court,
this
court
held
that
the
lower
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
to
pass
upon
that
question
and
remanded
the
matter
to
the
federal
reserve
or
the
banking
agency
in
that
case
saying,
we
have
concluded
that
district
court
that
it
is
the
exclusive
function
of
the
federal
reserve
board
to
act
in
such
cases.
in
cases
raising
issues
of
fact
not
within
the
conventional
experience
of
judges
or
cases
requiring
the
exercise
of
administrative
discretion,
agencies
created
by
congress
for
regulating
subject
matter
should
not
be
passed
over.
therefore,
we
submit
that
this
court
should
not,
by
and
grafting
the
potential
competition
theory
of
the
section
7
and
then
applying
that
to
banking,
pass
over
the
expertise
of
the
banking
agencies
as
to
who
and
when
there
should
be
entry
into
the
banking
field,
which
is
what
potential
competition
means,
potential
entry.
now
let
me
say
a
word
about
the
sponsorship
scheme
proposed
by
the
department.
it
is
true
as
my
colleague
mr.
moen
has
said
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
ambiguity
about
the
use
of
this
term
sponsorship.
in
fact,
there
is
evidence
that
banking
executives
like
others
in
other
businesses,
sometimes
help
new
institutions
that
they
give
advice.
old
lawyers
do
this
to
young
lawyers.
this
is
not
an
unknown
procedure.
however,
sponsorship
as
used
in
this
case
by
the
department
of
justice
means
and
i
think
must
mean
if
it
is
to
have
significance
that
contribution
of
capital
and
the
holding
of
some
sort
of
a
significant
legal
entrance
in
the
bank,
but
it
doesn’t
mean
that
it
means
nothing.
anybody
can
go
and
get
fringe.
i
suppose
i
could
go
down
and
ask
my
friendly
banker
how
i
go
about
organizing
a
bank.
however,
in
the
first
place
this
method,
if
approved
by
this
court,
would
be
available
only
to
national
banks.
there
is
no
contention
that
mr.
friedman
has
conceded.
it
wouldn’t
be
available
state
banks.
this
immediately
would
destroy
the
competitive
equality
between
national
and
state
banks
which
congress
clearly
intended,
as
this
court
has
often
said
in
cases
cited
in
our
brief.
second
place,
this
would
undermine
the
dual
banking
system
and
handicap
the
state
banks
by
giving
the
federal
banks
a
technique
not
available
to
state
banks.
2/3
of
all
the
commercial
banks
in
the
country
today
are
state
banks,
only1/3
are
national.
they
happen
to
be
the
larger
banks
but
this
would
give
the
advantage
to
the
national
banks.
further,
at
best,
this
scheme
is
expensive,
difficult,
and
risky
unless
available
not
only
--
not
to
all
banks
but
only
to
the
larger
banks.
it
is
clear
from
the
records
here
that
the
cost
of
forming
a
holding
company
and
organizing
a
bank
is
upwards
of
$2
million.
the
statutory
minimum
is
a-million-and-a-half
dollars.
however,
of
all
the
commercial
banks
in
the
united
states,
25%
are
under
5
million
in
deposits;
48%
under
10
million;
and
78%
under
25
million,
both
state
and
federal.
and
i
submit
that
as
a
practical
matter,
this
is
a
method
that
would
be
available
really
only
to
the
top
5%
of
the
banks
in
the
united
states.
furthermore,
this
scheme
would
endanger
new
and
small
banks
by
offering
and
threatening
undue
competition.
this
appears
in
the
record
in
the
present
case
at
page
1034.
the
court
asked
the
department
of
justice
counsel
and
i
quote,
“your
theory
is
that
if
a
new
bank
went
in
there,
spokane,
they
would
take
some
deposits
from
the
other
banks
and
therefore
the
other
banks
wouldn’t
make
as
much
money
and
therefore
would
increase
competition,
is
that
your
theory?”
and
the
department
counsel
said
“yes
sir.”
in
other
words,
new
and
small
banks
are
likely
to
be
the
victim
of
this
procedure.
these
are
the
ones
that
are
owned
and
by
small
business
and
by
the
minority
groups
that
are
struggling
for
recognition
today.
these
are
the
ones
that
are
protected
by
the
bank
regulatory
agencies.
under
plaintiff’s
theory
there
would
be
no
protection.
consequently,
if
the
plaintiff’s
sponsorship
scheme
were
approved
by
this
court,
this
would
insure
growth
by
the
largest
banks.
it
would
insure
the
foreclosure
of
markets
to
small
and
medium
size
banks
and
it
would
probably
lead
to
the
failure
of
small
banks
and
thus
ultimately
to
the
much
greater
concentration
of
banking
business
in
the
united
states.
now
fifth,
section
7
does
not
forbid
a
merger,
which
lessens
potential
competition
but
increases
actual
competition
in
the
relevant
market.
i
trust
i
need
not
point
out
that
the
court
did
in
falstaff.
that
the
courts
opinion
said
that
the
question
left
open
was
whether
a
new
entry
that
neither
help
nor
hurt
competition
was
illegal
merely
because
the
acquiring
company
could
but
did
not
entered
de
novo.
that
question
is
not
reached
here
because
in
both
cases,
there
is
evidence
that
here
the
entry
will
make
the
market
more
competitive.
the
court
found
in
this
case,
this
merger
will
make
the
spokane
market
even
more
competitive
as
it
will
replace
a
bank
with
a
limited
competitive
ability
with
one
with
greater
capacity
to
provide
loans
and
it
will
remove
its
competitive
disadvantage.
now,
plaintiff,
in
effect,
answers
this
by
saying
that
to
the
extent
the
court
relied
on
the
theory
the
merger
would
replace
washington
trust
with
the
bank
able
to
compete
more
effectively
that
these
are
factors
to
be
considered
on
the
community
needs
and
convenience
defense
and
not
in
asserting
the
competitive
impact
of
the
merger.
if
i
may
be
disrespectful,
i
say
nonsense,
to
say
that
an
increase
in
competition
cannot
be
considered
in
appraising
the
competitive
impact
simply
doesn’t
make
sense
under
the
antitrust
laws
or
under
any
other
laws.
in
fact,
justice
marshall
in
concurring
in
falstaff
said
that
if
a
company
would
have
remained
outside
the
market
but
to
the
possibility
of
entry
by
acquisition
and
if
it
is
exerting
no
influence
as
a
perceived
potential
entrant,
then
there
will
normally
be
no
competitive
loss
when
it
enters
by
acquisition.
indeed,
there
may
even
be
a
competitive
gain
to
the
extent
that
it
strengthens
the
market
position
of
the
acquired
firm,
which
is
exactly
the
case
here.
furthermore,
in
brown
shoe,
this
court
said,
congress
recognized
the
stimulation
to
competition
that
might
flow
from
particular
mergers.
when
concerned
as
to
the
act’s
breadth
was
expressed
supporters
the
amendment
indicated,
it
would
not
impede,
for
example,
a
merger
between
two
small
companies
to
enable
the
competition
to
compete
more
effectively
with
larger
corporations
dominating
the
relevant
market.
here
admittedly,
there
is
no
change
in
market
structure
or
concentration.
there
is
only
a
strengthening
of
one
competitor,
which
has
already
stimulated
new
competition
in
spokane
as
we
point
out
at
page
53
of
our
brief.
and
this
does
not
lessen
competition
but
increases
competition
which
is
the
purpose
of
section
7.
finally,
let
me
come
to
my
last
point,
last
former
point
and
then
i
will
now
or
later
answer
some
points
of
the
department
that
the
plaintiff
would
rewrite
section
7
so
that
potentiality
really
reduces
substantiality
to
triviality.
there
has
been
some
talk
as
to
what
potentiality
means,
and
mr.
friedman
has
candidly
said,
they’re
looking
at
very
long
range
effects.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
was
confirmed
by
a
speech
by
the
acting
deputy
assistant
attorney
general
the
antitrust
division
made
the
day
after
we
filed
our
brief
and
published
an
atrr
april
16,
1974.
it
is
number
699
at
pages
(d)
1
to
5
in
which
he
said
the
departments
concern
for
preserving
competition
is
premised
upon
the
belief
that
existing
market
structures
are
not
immutable
over
time.
changes
in
law,
technology,
business
philosophy
and
imperatives
of
the
market
place
may
result
in
future
market
entry
with
attended
increased
competition
in
a
manner,
which
would
not
have
been
predicted
at
an
earlier
time.
the
department’s
efforts,
he
candidly
states,
are
aimed
that
these
market
extension
cases,
which
involves
theories
of
potential
competition.
now
i
submit
that
to
say
that
potential
competition,
which
the
department
of
justice
is
now
protecting,
is
the
possibility
of
future
market
entry
in
some
presently
unpredictable
or
unforeseeable
manner,
is
to
say
that
we
are
dealing
with
something
that
is
improbable.
the
law
simply
cannot
deal
with
the
unpredictable
or
the
unforeseeable.
the
essence
of
legal
probability
is
foreseeability.
thus,
plaintiff
is
seeking
to
have
the
standard
of
proof
in
section
7
cases,
reduced
from
probability
and
substantiality
to
possibility
and
triviality.
plaintiff
asked
the
court
to
forbid
any
merger,
which
might
foreclose
any
unforeseeable
future
possibility
of
competition.
but
this
is
impossible
to
do
because
the
unforeseeable
we
simply
cannot
deal
with.
this
is
unreasonable,
unworkable,
unprecedented,
and
i
submit
a
formula
for
stagnation
not
competition.
furthermore,
in
my
brief
i
have
submitted
to
the
court
that
i
believe
that
this
standard,
if
it
becomes
established
in
the
law,
is
a
formula
that
will
threaten
civil
liberties.
the
brief
was
filed
april
8.
i
suggested
that
the
potential
enemies
in
authoritarian
countries
are
prosecuted
as
the
department
would
go
after
potential
competitors
here.
on
april
15,
the
week
after
we
filed
our
brief,
the
washington
star
news
published
a
little
item
saying
that
aleksandr
solzhenitsyn,
the
well
known
russian
author,
had
been
exiled
because,
it
was
said
by
a
leading
russian
spokesman,
as
he
was
guilty
of
making
“potentially
dangerous
proposals”.
they
said
that
he
was
accused
of
writing
utopian
and
potentially
dangerous
ideas.
now
this
is
the
language
of
authoritarianism.
this
is
the
doctrine
which
the
department
of
justice
would
have
this
court
accept
in
which
i
submit
if
accepted
in
these
cases
cannot
be
confined
of
these
cases.
if
we
--
if
potentiality
in
the
sense
of
unforeseeability,
unpredictability
that
which
cannot
be
really
met
by
present
proof,
cannot
be
dealt
with
on
the
basis
of
the
contemporary
record,
then
there
are
simply
no
standards.
there
is
no
way
that
we
can
deal
with
the
data
presented
with
the
evidence
if
the
court
is
going
to
permit
this
kind
of
proof.
my
time
is
up.
