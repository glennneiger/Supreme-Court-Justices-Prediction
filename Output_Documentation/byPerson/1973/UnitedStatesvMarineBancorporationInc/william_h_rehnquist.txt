rehnquist
mr.
friedman,
you
commented
earlier
about
the
government’s
view
of
the
desirability
of
de
novo
entry.
what
has
been
the
history
or
does
the
record
show
over
the
past
several
decades
of
de
novo
entry
into
the
banking
market
in
spokane?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
record
show
anything
about
the
history
of
de
novo
entry
into
the
banking
market
in
spokane?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
concededly
legal
under
the
laws
of
washington?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
friedman,
supposing
that
the
national
bank
of
washington
had
decided
to
absorb
the
65-form
bank,
the
american
commerce
bank
in
spokane,
you
say
there
is
only
three
fewer
branches
in
washington
trust.
wouldn’t
the
government
probably
have
challenged
that
merger
too
as
having
been
anti-competitor?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
it
just
becomes
a
question
of
decree,
doesn’t
it,
and
the
district
court
has
got
to
have
some
latitude
in
making
a
finding
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
the
national
bank’s
acquisition
of
farmers
&
merchants
bank,
if
it
had
come
about,
would
not
have
been
a
realization
of
there
desire
to
get
into
the
city
of
spokane?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
is
it,
down
on
the
columbia
river
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that’s
then
was
about
the
defensive
part
of
the
--
that
was
added
in
1966,
was
it
not
the
basic
competitive
analysis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
would
be
true
just
of
a
nationally
chartered
advantage?
