mr.
r.
a.
moen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
has
been
a
question
about
the
desire
of
the
national
bank
of
commerce
to
get
into
the
spokane
market,
but
if
the
question
is
whether
or
not
they
would
be
willing
to
go
into
any
manner
other
than
this
one
of
this
particular
merger,
there
are
four
principle
banking
markets
in
the
state
of
washington:
seattle,
everett,
tacoma
and
spokane.
at
the
present
time,
the
national
bank
of
commerce
has
all
of
its
officers
in
the
seattle
market.
it
does
not
have
any
representation
in
any
of
the
other
three
markets.
but
of
course
if
they,
at
some
acceptable
means
of
entry,
were
to
be
developed,
they
would
be
very
happy
to
go
into
that
market.
mr.
friedman
referred
to
the
trends
and
although
there
is
no
specific
finding
on
the
subject,
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
that
there
is
no
discernible
trend
in
the
state
of
washington
towards
concentrating
--
concentration
of
banking.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
number
of
banks
have
increased.
in
1960,
there
were
87
banks;
today,
there
are
92.
in
1960,
there
were
378
banking
offices
in
washington;
today,
there
are
681.
if
you
want
to
look
at
the
share
of
the
market
during
the
past
10
years,
the
share
of
the
market
which
commerce
has
picked
up
has
increased
from
18.9
in
1960
to
19.1
today,
so
that
the
share
of
the
market
is
practically
constant.
so
whether
you
look
at
the
number
of
banks
or
you
look
at
the
number
of
branches
or
whether
you
look
at
the
share
of
the
market,
there
is
no
discernible
trend
in
the
state
of
washington
towards
concentration.
now,
justice
is
really
asserting
three
ways
in
this
merger
in
which
it
consummated
lessen
competition
so
as
to
violate
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
first,
they
contend
that
but
for
this
merger,
these
two
banks
will
someday
be
in
direct
competition.
of
course,
this
can
happen
only
in
the
event
that
the
two
banks
get
offices
in
the
same
market.
either
commerce
will
have
to
move
into
the
spokane
market
or
spoke
or
the
washington
trust
bank
is
going
to
have
to
move
out
and
into
some
market
where
commerce
is
doing
business.
they
make
a
second
contention
as
to
the
violation
of
the
act
and
that
they
argue
that
commerce
is
now
on
the
fringe
of
the
market
and
exert
some
competitive
influence
on
the
competitors
that
are
in
the
market.
the
argument
upon
which
they
lay
the
greatest
stress
is
that
--
but
this
merger,
these
two
banks
will
become
direct
competitors.
and
if
the
merger
is
enjoined,
commerce
will
enter
spokane
by
establishing
a
branch
of
its
bank
de
novo
or
what
they
call
tantamount
to
de
novo,
that’s
the
sponsored
bank
procedure,
or
by
foothold
entry.
now,
the
court
is
asking
questions
with
respect
to
foothold
entry.
the
trial
court
made
a
finding
that
there
is
no
bank
in
spokane
today,
which
could
serve
as
a
foothold
entrant.
there
are
only
two
banks
in
the
city
of
spokane,
which
are
smaller
than
washington
trust
bank.
one
is
the
american
commercial
bank,
the
state
bank
to
which
mr.
friedman
alluded.
that
bank
was
formed
in
1965,
but
it
has,
in
its
charter,
a
prohibition
against
its
merger
or
its
sale
or
combination
of
any
other
bank
for
a
period
of
ten
years.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
that’s
required
by
statute
of
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
and
that
period
will
expire
in
1975,
but
of
course,
the
national
bank
of
commerce
or
no
one
else
has
any
knowledge
or
information
at
this
time
that
that
bank
will
be
for
sale
at
the
end
of
the
ten
year
period.
and
even
if
it
were
for
sale,
of
course,
there
is
no
assurance
that
national
bank
of
commerce
would
be
the
successful
purchaser.
these
banks,
like
any
other
product,
are
sold
to
whoever
makes
the
highest
bid,
and
if
this
bank
were
for
sale
for
which
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
would
be,
it
undoubtedly
would
go
to
the
highest
bidder,
which
might
be
the
bank
of
commerce
or
it
might
be
one
of
its
competitors.
they’ve
also
argued
--
mr.
r.
a.
moen
farmers
&
merchants
bank.
but
the
farmers
&
merchants
bank
is
not
within
the
city
of
spokane.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
the
farmers
&
merchants
bank
has
a
branch
in
the
shopping
center
about
five
or
six
miles
east
of
the
center
of
downtown,
spokane.
so,
we
contend
that
even
getting
into
--
if
we
were
to
acquire
the
farmers
&
merchants
bank,
it
would
not
be
entry
into
spokane.
all
of
the
witnesses
conceded
that
you
can’t
service
downtown
spokane
or
be
a
part
of
the
spokane
market
if
your
only
branch
is
out
in
the
suburbs.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
once
you
were
there,
you
still
can’t
get
into
the
city
of
spokane.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
it’s
in
the
same
county.
but
you
can’t
go
into
the
city.
the
only
banks
in
the
city
that
can
give
a
branch
in
the
city
are
the
banks
that
have
their
head
office
in
the
city.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
that
is
correct.
the
branches
or
the
bank
that
you
may
acquire
such
as
washington
trust
bank
can
go
out
and
establish
new
branches
in
the
city
of
spokane.
but
once
the
national
bank
of
commerce
acquires
the
washington
trust
bank,
then
it
can
no
longer
branch
in
the
city
of
spokane
or
in
the
county,
which
only
in
the
city
where
it
has
its
principal
place
of
business
and
in
the
county
where
it
has
its
principal
place
of
business.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
there
are
--
there
were
negotiations
for
the
purchase
of
the
farmers
&
merchants
bank
that
didn’t
even
get
closer
to
the
price.
i
think
the
record
here
shows
that
commerce
have
it
price
in
mind
to
somewhere
as
maybe
one-and-a-half
or
$2
million
and
the
lowest
asked
price
was
somewhere
nearly
$5
million.
the
negotiations
did
even
get
the
point
where
the
amount
of
money
which
commerce
is
willing
to
pay
was
even
transmitted
to
the
farmers
&
merchants
bank.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
i
would
say
maybe
a
year
or
two.
just
a
very
short
time,
but
i
would
like
to
press
upon
the
court
the
fact
that
acquisition
of
farmers
&
merchants
does
not
put
you
into
the
city
of
spokane.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
it
would
not
if
given
the
main
consents
of
the
city
of
spokane.
now,
our
defense
to
this
case
is
not
only
legal,
but
factual.
we
think
that
this
case
primarily
is
a
factual
case.
and
the
trial
court
rejected
all
three
of
the
arguments
of
justice
department
and
assigned
a
factual
basis
for
all
of
them.
the
trial
court
found
that
even
the
absence
of
these
statutes
the
bank,
the
national
bank
of
commerce
would
not
go
into
downtown
spokane
if
they
had
to
go
in
by
de
novo
entry
or
by
the
acquisition
of
a
small
toehold
bank.
the
court
found
that
it
wouldn’t
be
compatible
with
prudent
business
practice
in
commercial
banking
for
a
major
or
full
service
bank
such
as
commerce
to
enter
a
major
metropolitan
area
such
as
spokane
with
a
limited
service
bank
or
a
small
bank
which
would
be
compatible
with
the
amount
of
deposits
that
they
might
reasonably
expect
to
obtain.
as
we’ve
just
mentioned
if
they
did
go
in
and
they
couldn’t
branch
and
that
branching
in
washington
is
almost
essential
to
affect
the
competition
in
the
metropolitan
areas,
such
as
spokane.
there
happens
to
be
a
very
good
example
in
the
city
of
spokane
of
the
imprudence
of
attempting
to
go
in
with
a
small
branch.
the
pacific
national
bank
is
a
subsidiary
of
western
bancorporation,
the
largest
bank
holding
company
within
mississippi.
it’s
the
third
largest
bank
in
the
state
of
washington.
now,
ten
years
ago
in
1964
it
did,
in
fact,
go
into
the
city
of
spokane
by
toehold
entry,
by
acquiring
a
small
branch
or
a
small
bank
which
had
two
branches;
one
in
downtown
spokane
and
one
out
on
the
whitworth
college
campus.
since
that
time
in
ten
years,
they
have
not
been
able
to
increase
their
share
of
the
market.
but
today,
they
are
the
smallest
bank
in
spokane
measured
by
spokane
deposits
and
there
is
really
no
reason
to
believe
that
if
commerce
attempted
to
go
in
by
foothold
that
they
could
do
any
better
than
pacific
nationals
bank
has
done.
the
growth
in
spokane
during
the
last
ten
years
has
been
slow.
the
lower
court
found
that
there
has
been
some
growth
in
the
last
ten
years.
i
think
the
town
has
in
fact
lost
10,000
population
and
county
has
grown
about
3%.
now
this
compares
with
other
markets
where
commerce
isn’t
now
located
such
as
everett
which
is
increased
10,000
during
the
period
the
spokane
has
lost
10,000
and
the
county
in
which
everett
is
located
has
increased
in
population
almost
35%.
the
city
of
tacoma,
which
is
another
market
in
which
commerce
isn’t
--
doesn’t
presently
have
offices
has
actually
increased
about
15,000.
now,
the
importance
of
this
is
simply
that
if
commerce
did
decide
that
they
want
to
go
into
one
of
these
other
markets
and
wanted
to
spend
their
capital
for
that
purpose,
the
chances
are
that
they
would
go
into
everett
or
tacoma
much
sooner
than
they
would
go
into
spokane.
and
this
was
just
another
reason
if
the
court
assigned
as
to
his
finding
as
to
why
it
was
not
likely
that
commerce
would
go
into
spokane
if
they
had
to
go
in
by
de
novo
entry.
the
regional
administrator
of
national
banks
in
washington
took
the
stand
and
testified
that
in
his
opinion
it
was
not
likely
that
there
would
be
any
future
charters
for
banks
granted
in
spokane
in
the
reasonably
foreseeable
future.
he
based
this
on
the
population
growth
of
the
city
and
such
other
factors
as
the
comptroller
considers
in
passing
on
new
bank
applications.
now,
as
i
said
we
have
these
factual
findings.
what
the
court
really
found
was
that
there
just
wasn’t
sufficient
economic
incentive
to
put
commerce
into
spokane
if
they
had
to
go
in
on
a
de
novo
basis.
and
of
course
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
the
statutory
barriers
that
mr.
friedman
alluded
to.
the
statute
which
prohibits
branching
in
washington
is
found
in
remington’s
code
of
washington,
30.40.029.
it’s
reproduced
at
pages
4
and
5
of
our
brief,
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
particular
attention
to
the
last
paragraph
of
the
statute
which
appears
on
page
4.
now,
this
statute
provides,
this
is
plainly
as
it
can
provide
insofar
as
it’s
pertinent
to
this
case
that
commerce
cannot
go
into
spokane
with
a
de
novo
branch.
justice
argues
that
the
statute
maybe
evaded
or
circumvented
an
entry
tantamount,
a
de
novo
entry
maybe
achieved
by
their
so-called
sponsored
bank
procedure.
i’d
also
like
to
tell
the
court
this
that
this
word
“sponsor”
has
been
a
very
misleading
word
in
this
case,
because
practically,
all
new
banks
in
washington
are
sponsored
in
one
way
or
another
when
they
are
formed,
and
the
comptroller,
of
course,
encourages
this
because
it’s
been
official,
both
to
the
sponsoring
bank
as
well
as
to
the
sponsored
bank.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
they
have
control
over
the
bank
or
that
they
can
branch
when
they
wanted.
for
example,
commerce
which
has
107
branches,
testified
that
they
don’t
have
one
single
branch
that
was
ever
sponsored
bank,
i
mean
the
bank
that
they
sponsored.
it’s
true
that
they
assist
these
banks
in
various
ways,
but
columbia
center
was
brought
up
here.
there
is
both
the
chairman
of
columbia
center
testified
that
they’re
not
obligated
to
sell
their
bank
to
commerce
at
any
time
either
the
assets
of
the
bank
or
the
stock,
and
the
officers
of
marine
bancorporation
testified
that
they
have
no
agreement
either
oral
or
written
to
acquire
the
bank
at
any
time.
now
it’s
true
that
they
--
mr.
r.
a.
moen
the
word
“sponsor”
as
we
have
used
it
means
to
aid
or
assist.
i
think
the
word
sponsor
as
justice
has
referred
to
it
means
to
have
control
of
it.
so
that
they
can
force
the
sale
of
the
bank.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
well
the
sponsored
bank
procedure,
as
referred
to
by
the
justice
department,
means
to
have
control
of
it.
what
i’m
saying
is
that
commerce
has
never
acquired
any
bank
and
we
say
even
assisted
--
and
of
course
the
only
bank
that
i
could
say
that
they
sponsored
was
columbia
center.
i
would
concede
that
they
sponsored
that
bank,
but
even
there
they
sponsored
in
the
sense
that
they
went
out
and
they
helped
it
get
management,
they
helped
it
get
directors.
what
really
happened
here
was
that
the
--
mr.
r.
a.
moen
no,
that
did
it
to
satisfy
a
commercial
customer.
the
allied
stores
are
putting
a
shopping
center
into
central
washington,
and
of
course
they
wanted
a
banking
service
there.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
no,
it’s
just
--
we
referred
to
the
suburb
bank
of
farmers
&
merchants.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
no,
i
think
what
mr.
justice
marshall
is
referring
to
is
a
bank
in
central
washington.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
at
columbia
center,
yes.
now
it’s
true
that
in
that
bank,
in
that
particular
case,
in
order
to
bring
banking
service
into
the
community,
commerce
did,
i
would
say,
sponsor
a
bank
in
the
sense
that
they
went
out
and
help
them
get
management.
they
furnish
them
with
about
three
directors
out
of
seven,
but
the
important
thing
to
me
is
the
purpose
for
which
this
was
done.
this
is
not
a
case
for
commerce
deciding
they
wanted
to
get
into
bank
and
sent
out
people
or
stockholders
to
organize
a
bank.
what
really
happened
was
that
the
business
people
of
the
city
applied
for
a
bank
and
they
were
turned
down
by
the
regional
administrator
for
the
reason
that
they
did
not
have
anyone
in
the
organization
that
had
any
particular
knowledge
of
banking.
and
so,
they
came
to
the
national
bank
of
commerce
and
sought
that
assistance
and
they
obtained
it.
but
here
again
as
i
say
that
that
doesn’t
give
commerce
any
assurance
that
they
are
ever
going
to
acquire
that
bank,
and
the
only
thing
that’s
important
with
respect
to
this
procedure
is
whether
or
not
it
affords
to
commerce
some
method
of
getting
into
the
city.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
means
of
entry.
we
contend
we
don’t
have
any
means
of
entry
in
the
spokane
that
regard
by
our
statutes.
they
come
back
and
say
we
can
get
into
spokane
and
they
can
get
in
this
particular
manner,
which
they
call
the
sponsored
bank
method.
and
we
deny
that
and
what
i’m
saying
that
so
far
as
columbia
center
is
concerned
that
that
does
not
afford
to
us
in
means
of
entry
into
spokane.
now,
let
me
mention
these
five
branches
with
mr.
whiterspoon
contented
that
the
old
national
bank
picked
up.
they
apparently
did,
on
two
occasions,
they
actually
sent
someone
out
to
attempt
to
organize
the
bank
and
obviously,
or
mr.
whiterspoon
said,
for
the
purpose
of
actually
acquiring
the
bank.
now,
the
record
here
isn’t
entirely
clear
as
to
this
is
what
they
did,
but
what
i
contend
is
that
it
really
doesn’t
make
much
difference.
one
of
these
arrangements
was
made
in
1959,
two
of
them
were
made
in
1962,
and
two
of
them
made
in
1964.
and
since
that
time,
so
far
as
this
record
shows,
there
hasn’t
been
any
such
acquisitions
or
any
such
means
of
entry
by
any
other
bank.
well,
my
co-counsel
here
has
given
me
a
note
to
make
it
clear
that
columbia
center
is
not
in
spokane,
but
i
think
i
answered
that
question
that
it’s
down
in
central
washington.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
it’s
down
in
kennewick
or
in
the
richmond
area
which
is
near
the
columbia
river
area.
now,
as
i’ve
said
that
this
statute
which
prevents
us
form
branching
in
washington
as
one
statute,
which
we
are
concerned
with,
there
is
a
second
statute,
the
holding
company
statute,
which
prohibits
any
bank
holding
company
in
washington
from
owning
or
controlling
more
than
25%
of
the
capital
stock
of
another
bank.
now,
i
point
that
out
to
show
that
we
are
not
only
stopped
from
branching,
but
we
are
only
stopped
from
holding
company
expansion,
because
the
holding
company
can’t
possibly
own
more
than
25%
of
the
stock
of
the
back.
and
of
course,
you
cannot
control
either
the
seller
of
the
bank
or
the
purchaser
of
the
bank
if
you
only
have
a
25%
control.
in
washington,
you
have
to
have
67%
of
the
stock
of
the
bank;
you
have
to
have
a
consent
of
67%
of
the
shareholders
before
you
can
sell.
so
that
on
this
withholding
company,
this
holding
company
statute,
we
have
new
--
we
don’t
have
the
power
or
the
authority
to
expand
in
that
way.
the
penalty
provided
in
the
statute
is
forfeiture
of
the
holding
company
charter.
so,
no
prudent
person
is
going
to
attempt
to
expand
in
that
manner.
now
with
respect
to
this
so-called
wings
theory,
justice
is
also
contending
that
commerce,
by
reason
of
its
positions
of
the
wings,
exerts
a
beneficial
pro-competitive
influence
on
the
competitors
in
the
market.
justice
concedes
on
page
27
of
their
brief
that
this
was
not
the
primary
basis
upon
which
they
tried
the
case,
but
it
is
in
the
pleadings
and
always
mentioned
by
two
or
three
witnesses.
but
i
like
to
point
out
that
in
this
respect,
all
they
showed
was
the
proximity
to
the
market
and
there
is
utterly
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
they
had
any
effect
upon
the
competitors
in
the
market.
so
that
the
mere
physical
proximity,
of
course,
without
any
showing
of,
in
effect,
on
a
better
consumer
market,
doesn’t
show
or
can’t
develop
into
any
blasting
of
competition.
there
were
four
witnesses
for
the
bank,
two
bank
officers
and
two
economists
who
testified
that
commerce,
prior
to
the
announcement
of
the
merger,
exerted
no
influence
at
all
on
the
spokane
market.
with
respect
to
the
washington
state
bank
moving
out
into
other
areas,
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
justice
did
not
try
the
crew
what
banking
markets
or
what
sections
they
might
move
out
into.
they
simply
argue
that
the
bank
has
the
capability
of
expanding
and,
therefore,
its
elimination
would
be
a
lessening
the
competition
under
section
7.
now,
in
conclusion,
i
would
want
to
point
out
that
both
parties
in
the
case
are
urging
what
they
considered
to
be
pro-competitive
action.
what
the
justice
department’s
case
really
boils
down
to
simply
that
they’re
saying
that
it’s
pro-competitive
to
save
commerce
for
some
future
entrant
into
the
market.
we
contend
that
if
we
move
into
the
market
right
now,
a
bigger
bank,
a
much
stronger
bank
that
that
is
also
pro-competitive.
it’s
--
the
trial
court
found
that
the
spokane
banking
market
actually
needs
another
competitor
of
the
size
of
seattle
first.
and
what
i
think
that
the
real
issue
for
this
court
is
to
which
is
the
more
pro-competitive,
is
it
to
say
this
to
the
bank
that
they
might
enter
the
spokane
market
ten
years
from
now,
and
then
maybe
spend
another
ten
years
in
attempting
to
build
their
deposits
to
a
point
where
they
can
actually
compete
or
wouldn’t
it
be
more
pro-competitive
for
them
to
go
in
immediately.
i’d
also
like
to
say
--
mr.
r.
a.
moen
yes
i’m
afraid
i
am.
i
will
bring
my
argument
to
the
close.
thank
you.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
has
been
a
question
about
the
desire
of
the
national
bank
of
commerce
to
get
into
the
spokane
market,
but
if
the
question
is
whether
or
not
they
would
be
willing
to
go
into
any
manner
other
than
this
one
of
this
particular
merger,
there
are
four
principle
banking
markets
in
the
state
of
washington:
seattle,
everett,
tacoma
and
spokane.
at
the
present
time,
the
national
bank
of
commerce
has
all
of
its
officers
in
the
seattle
market.
it
does
not
have
any
representation
in
any
of
the
other
three
markets.
but
of
course
if
they,
at
some
acceptable
means
of
entry,
were
to
be
developed,
they
would
be
very
happy
to
go
into
that
market.
mr.
friedman
referred
to
the
trends
and
although
there
is
no
specific
finding
on
the
subject,
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
that
there
is
no
discernible
trend
in
the
state
of
washington
towards
concentrating
--
concentration
of
banking.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
number
of
banks
have
increased.
in
1960,
there
were
87
banks;
today,
there
are
92.
in
1960,
there
were
378
banking
offices
in
washington;
today,
there
are
681.
if
you
want
to
look
at
the
share
of
the
market
during
the
past
10
years,
the
share
of
the
market
which
commerce
has
picked
up
has
increased
from
18.9
in
1960
to
19.1
today,
so
that
the
share
of
the
market
is
practically
constant.
so
whether
you
look
at
the
number
of
banks
or
you
look
at
the
number
of
branches
or
whether
you
look
at
the
share
of
the
market,
there
is
no
discernible
trend
in
the
state
of
washington
towards
concentration.
now,
justice
is
really
asserting
three
ways
in
this
merger
in
which
it
consummated
lessen
competition
so
as
to
violate
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
first,
they
contend
that
but
for
this
merger,
these
two
banks
will
someday
be
in
direct
competition.
of
course,
this
can
happen
only
in
the
event
that
the
two
banks
get
offices
in
the
same
market.
either
commerce
will
have
to
move
into
the
spokane
market
or
spoke
or
the
washington
trust
bank
is
going
to
have
to
move
out
and
into
some
market
where
commerce
is
doing
business.
they
make
a
second
contention
as
to
the
violation
of
the
act
and
that
they
argue
that
commerce
is
now
on
the
fringe
of
the
market
and
exert
some
competitive
influence
on
the
competitors
that
are
in
the
market.
the
argument
upon
which
they
lay
the
greatest
stress
is
that
--
but
this
merger,
these
two
banks
will
become
direct
competitors.
and
if
the
merger
is
enjoined,
commerce
will
enter
spokane
by
establishing
a
branch
of
its
bank
de
novo
or
what
they
call
tantamount
to
de
novo,
that’s
the
sponsored
bank
procedure,
or
by
foothold
entry.
now,
the
court
is
asking
questions
with
respect
to
foothold
entry.
the
trial
court
made
a
finding
that
there
is
no
bank
in
spokane
today,
which
could
serve
as
a
foothold
entrant.
there
are
only
two
banks
in
the
city
of
spokane,
which
are
smaller
than
washington
trust
bank.
one
is
the
american
commercial
bank,
the
state
bank
to
which
mr.
friedman
alluded.
that
bank
was
formed
in
1965,
but
it
has,
in
its
charter,
a
prohibition
against
its
merger
or
its
sale
or
combination
of
any
other
bank
for
a
period
of
ten
years.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
that’s
required
by
statute
of
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
and
that
period
will
expire
in
1975,
but
of
course,
the
national
bank
of
commerce
or
no
one
else
has
any
knowledge
or
information
at
this
time
that
that
bank
will
be
for
sale
at
the
end
of
the
ten
year
period.
and
even
if
it
were
for
sale,
of
course,
there
is
no
assurance
that
national
bank
of
commerce
would
be
the
successful
purchaser.
these
banks,
like
any
other
product,
are
sold
to
whoever
makes
the
highest
bid,
and
if
this
bank
were
for
sale
for
which
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
would
be,
it
undoubtedly
would
go
to
the
highest
bidder,
which
might
be
the
bank
of
commerce
or
it
might
be
one
of
its
competitors.
they’ve
also
argued
--
mr.
r.
a.
moen
farmers
&
merchants
bank.
but
the
farmers
&
merchants
bank
is
not
within
the
city
of
spokane.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
the
farmers
&
merchants
bank
has
a
branch
in
the
shopping
center
about
five
or
six
miles
east
of
the
center
of
downtown,
spokane.
so,
we
contend
that
even
getting
into
--
if
we
were
to
acquire
the
farmers
&
merchants
bank,
it
would
not
be
entry
into
spokane.
all
of
the
witnesses
conceded
that
you
can’t
service
downtown
spokane
or
be
a
part
of
the
spokane
market
if
your
only
branch
is
out
in
the
suburbs.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
once
you
were
there,
you
still
can’t
get
into
the
city
of
spokane.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
it’s
in
the
same
county.
but
you
can’t
go
into
the
city.
the
only
banks
in
the
city
that
can
give
a
branch
in
the
city
are
the
banks
that
have
their
head
office
in
the
city.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
that
is
correct.
the
branches
or
the
bank
that
you
may
acquire
such
as
washington
trust
bank
can
go
out
and
establish
new
branches
in
the
city
of
spokane.
but
once
the
national
bank
of
commerce
acquires
the
washington
trust
bank,
then
it
can
no
longer
branch
in
the
city
of
spokane
or
in
the
county,
which
only
in
the
city
where
it
has
its
principal
place
of
business
and
in
the
county
where
it
has
its
principal
place
of
business.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
there
are
--
there
were
negotiations
for
the
purchase
of
the
farmers
&
merchants
bank
that
didn’t
even
get
closer
to
the
price.
i
think
the
record
here
shows
that
commerce
have
it
price
in
mind
to
somewhere
as
maybe
one-and-a-half
or
$2
million
and
the
lowest
asked
price
was
somewhere
nearly
$5
million.
the
negotiations
did
even
get
the
point
where
the
amount
of
money
which
commerce
is
willing
to
pay
was
even
transmitted
to
the
farmers
&
merchants
bank.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
i
would
say
maybe
a
year
or
two.
just
a
very
short
time,
but
i
would
like
to
press
upon
the
court
the
fact
that
acquisition
of
farmers
&
merchants
does
not
put
you
into
the
city
of
spokane.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
it
would
not
if
given
the
main
consents
of
the
city
of
spokane.
now,
our
defense
to
this
case
is
not
only
legal,
but
factual.
we
think
that
this
case
primarily
is
a
factual
case.
and
the
trial
court
rejected
all
three
of
the
arguments
of
justice
department
and
assigned
a
factual
basis
for
all
of
them.
the
trial
court
found
that
even
the
absence
of
these
statutes
the
bank,
the
national
bank
of
commerce
would
not
go
into
downtown
spokane
if
they
had
to
go
in
by
de
novo
entry
or
by
the
acquisition
of
a
small
toehold
bank.
the
court
found
that
it
wouldn’t
be
compatible
with
prudent
business
practice
in
commercial
banking
for
a
major
or
full
service
bank
such
as
commerce
to
enter
a
major
metropolitan
area
such
as
spokane
with
a
limited
service
bank
or
a
small
bank
which
would
be
compatible
with
the
amount
of
deposits
that
they
might
reasonably
expect
to
obtain.
as
we’ve
just
mentioned
if
they
did
go
in
and
they
couldn’t
branch
and
that
branching
in
washington
is
almost
essential
to
affect
the
competition
in
the
metropolitan
areas,
such
as
spokane.
there
happens
to
be
a
very
good
example
in
the
city
of
spokane
of
the
imprudence
of
attempting
to
go
in
with
a
small
branch.
the
pacific
national
bank
is
a
subsidiary
of
western
bancorporation,
the
largest
bank
holding
company
within
mississippi.
it’s
the
third
largest
bank
in
the
state
of
washington.
now,
ten
years
ago
in
1964
it
did,
in
fact,
go
into
the
city
of
spokane
by
toehold
entry,
by
acquiring
a
small
branch
or
a
small
bank
which
had
two
branches;
one
in
downtown
spokane
and
one
out
on
the
whitworth
college
campus.
since
that
time
in
ten
years,
they
have
not
been
able
to
increase
their
share
of
the
market.
but
today,
they
are
the
smallest
bank
in
spokane
measured
by
spokane
deposits
and
there
is
really
no
reason
to
believe
that
if
commerce
attempted
to
go
in
by
foothold
that
they
could
do
any
better
than
pacific
nationals
bank
has
done.
the
growth
in
spokane
during
the
last
ten
years
has
been
slow.
the
lower
court
found
that
there
has
been
some
growth
in
the
last
ten
years.
i
think
the
town
has
in
fact
lost
10,000
population
and
county
has
grown
about
3%.
now
this
compares
with
other
markets
where
commerce
isn’t
now
located
such
as
everett
which
is
increased
10,000
during
the
period
the
spokane
has
lost
10,000
and
the
county
in
which
everett
is
located
has
increased
in
population
almost
35%.
the
city
of
tacoma,
which
is
another
market
in
which
commerce
isn’t
--
doesn’t
presently
have
offices
has
actually
increased
about
15,000.
now,
the
importance
of
this
is
simply
that
if
commerce
did
decide
that
they
want
to
go
into
one
of
these
other
markets
and
wanted
to
spend
their
capital
for
that
purpose,
the
chances
are
that
they
would
go
into
everett
or
tacoma
much
sooner
than
they
would
go
into
spokane.
and
this
was
just
another
reason
if
the
court
assigned
as
to
his
finding
as
to
why
it
was
not
likely
that
commerce
would
go
into
spokane
if
they
had
to
go
in
by
de
novo
entry.
the
regional
administrator
of
national
banks
in
washington
took
the
stand
and
testified
that
in
his
opinion
it
was
not
likely
that
there
would
be
any
future
charters
for
banks
granted
in
spokane
in
the
reasonably
foreseeable
future.
he
based
this
on
the
population
growth
of
the
city
and
such
other
factors
as
the
comptroller
considers
in
passing
on
new
bank
applications.
now,
as
i
said
we
have
these
factual
findings.
what
the
court
really
found
was
that
there
just
wasn’t
sufficient
economic
incentive
to
put
commerce
into
spokane
if
they
had
to
go
in
on
a
de
novo
basis.
and
of
course
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
the
statutory
barriers
that
mr.
friedman
alluded
to.
the
statute
which
prohibits
branching
in
washington
is
found
in
remington’s
code
of
washington,
30.40.029.
it’s
reproduced
at
pages
4
and
5
of
our
brief,
and
i
would
like
to
call
the
court’s
particular
attention
to
the
last
paragraph
of
the
statute
which
appears
on
page
4.
now,
this
statute
provides,
this
is
plainly
as
it
can
provide
insofar
as
it’s
pertinent
to
this
case
that
commerce
cannot
go
into
spokane
with
a
de
novo
branch.
justice
argues
that
the
statute
maybe
evaded
or
circumvented
an
entry
tantamount,
a
de
novo
entry
maybe
achieved
by
their
so-called
sponsored
bank
procedure.
i’d
also
like
to
tell
the
court
this
that
this
word
“sponsor”
has
been
a
very
misleading
word
in
this
case,
because
practically,
all
new
banks
in
washington
are
sponsored
in
one
way
or
another
when
they
are
formed,
and
the
comptroller,
of
course,
encourages
this
because
it’s
been
official,
both
to
the
sponsoring
bank
as
well
as
to
the
sponsored
bank.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
they
have
control
over
the
bank
or
that
they
can
branch
when
they
wanted.
for
example,
commerce
which
has
107
branches,
testified
that
they
don’t
have
one
single
branch
that
was
ever
sponsored
bank,
i
mean
the
bank
that
they
sponsored.
it’s
true
that
they
assist
these
banks
in
various
ways,
but
columbia
center
was
brought
up
here.
there
is
both
the
chairman
of
columbia
center
testified
that
they’re
not
obligated
to
sell
their
bank
to
commerce
at
any
time
either
the
assets
of
the
bank
or
the
stock,
and
the
officers
of
marine
bancorporation
testified
that
they
have
no
agreement
either
oral
or
written
to
acquire
the
bank
at
any
time.
now
it’s
true
that
they
--
mr.
r.
a.
moen
the
word
“sponsor”
as
we
have
used
it
means
to
aid
or
assist.
i
think
the
word
sponsor
as
justice
has
referred
to
it
means
to
have
control
of
it.
so
that
they
can
force
the
sale
of
the
bank.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
well
the
sponsored
bank
procedure,
as
referred
to
by
the
justice
department,
means
to
have
control
of
it.
what
i’m
saying
is
that
commerce
has
never
acquired
any
bank
and
we
say
even
assisted
--
and
of
course
the
only
bank
that
i
could
say
that
they
sponsored
was
columbia
center.
i
would
concede
that
they
sponsored
that
bank,
but
even
there
they
sponsored
in
the
sense
that
they
went
out
and
they
helped
it
get
management,
they
helped
it
get
directors.
what
really
happened
here
was
that
the
--
mr.
r.
a.
moen
no,
that
did
it
to
satisfy
a
commercial
customer.
the
allied
stores
are
putting
a
shopping
center
into
central
washington,
and
of
course
they
wanted
a
banking
service
there.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
no,
it’s
just
--
we
referred
to
the
suburb
bank
of
farmers
&
merchants.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
no,
i
think
what
mr.
justice
marshall
is
referring
to
is
a
bank
in
central
washington.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
at
columbia
center,
yes.
now
it’s
true
that
in
that
bank,
in
that
particular
case,
in
order
to
bring
banking
service
into
the
community,
commerce
did,
i
would
say,
sponsor
a
bank
in
the
sense
that
they
went
out
and
help
them
get
management.
they
furnish
them
with
about
three
directors
out
of
seven,
but
the
important
thing
to
me
is
the
purpose
for
which
this
was
done.
this
is
not
a
case
for
commerce
deciding
they
wanted
to
get
into
bank
and
sent
out
people
or
stockholders
to
organize
a
bank.
what
really
happened
was
that
the
business
people
of
the
city
applied
for
a
bank
and
they
were
turned
down
by
the
regional
administrator
for
the
reason
that
they
did
not
have
anyone
in
the
organization
that
had
any
particular
knowledge
of
banking.
and
so,
they
came
to
the
national
bank
of
commerce
and
sought
that
assistance
and
they
obtained
it.
but
here
again
as
i
say
that
that
doesn’t
give
commerce
any
assurance
that
they
are
ever
going
to
acquire
that
bank,
and
the
only
thing
that’s
important
with
respect
to
this
procedure
is
whether
or
not
it
affords
to
commerce
some
method
of
getting
into
the
city.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
means
of
entry.
we
contend
we
don’t
have
any
means
of
entry
in
the
spokane
that
regard
by
our
statutes.
they
come
back
and
say
we
can
get
into
spokane
and
they
can
get
in
this
particular
manner,
which
they
call
the
sponsored
bank
method.
and
we
deny
that
and
what
i’m
saying
that
so
far
as
columbia
center
is
concerned
that
that
does
not
afford
to
us
in
means
of
entry
into
spokane.
now,
let
me
mention
these
five
branches
with
mr.
whiterspoon
contented
that
the
old
national
bank
picked
up.
they
apparently
did,
on
two
occasions,
they
actually
sent
someone
out
to
attempt
to
organize
the
bank
and
obviously,
or
mr.
whiterspoon
said,
for
the
purpose
of
actually
acquiring
the
bank.
now,
the
record
here
isn’t
entirely
clear
as
to
this
is
what
they
did,
but
what
i
contend
is
that
it
really
doesn’t
make
much
difference.
one
of
these
arrangements
was
made
in
1959,
two
of
them
were
made
in
1962,
and
two
of
them
made
in
1964.
and
since
that
time,
so
far
as
this
record
shows,
there
hasn’t
been
any
such
acquisitions
or
any
such
means
of
entry
by
any
other
bank.
well,
my
co-counsel
here
has
given
me
a
note
to
make
it
clear
that
columbia
center
is
not
in
spokane,
but
i
think
i
answered
that
question
that
it’s
down
in
central
washington.
mr.
r.
a.
moen
it’s
down
in
kennewick
or
in
the
richmond
area
which
is
near
the
columbia
river
area.
now,
as
i’ve
said
that
this
statute
which
prevents
us
form
branching
in
washington
as
one
statute,
which
we
are
concerned
with,
there
is
a
second
statute,
the
holding
company
statute,
which
prohibits
any
bank
holding
company
in
washington
from
owning
or
controlling
more
than
25%
of
the
capital
stock
of
another
bank.
now,
i
point
that
out
to
show
that
we
are
not
only
stopped
from
branching,
but
we
are
only
stopped
from
holding
company
expansion,
because
the
holding
company
can’t
possibly
own
more
than
25%
of
the
stock
of
the
back.
and
of
course,
you
cannot
control
either
the
seller
of
the
bank
or
the
purchaser
of
the
bank
if
you
only
have
a
25%
control.
in
washington,
you
have
to
have
67%
of
the
stock
of
the
bank;
you
have
to
have
a
consent
of
67%
of
the
shareholders
before
you
can
sell.
so
that
on
this
withholding
company,
this
holding
company
statute,
we
have
new
--
we
don’t
have
the
power
or
the
authority
to
expand
in
that
way.
the
penalty
provided
in
the
statute
is
forfeiture
of
the
holding
company
charter.
so,
no
prudent
person
is
going
to
attempt
to
expand
in
that
manner.
now
with
respect
to
this
so-called
wings
theory,
justice
is
also
contending
that
commerce,
by
reason
of
its
positions
of
the
wings,
exerts
a
beneficial
pro-competitive
influence
on
the
competitors
in
the
market.
justice
concedes
on
page
27
of
their
brief
that
this
was
not
the
primary
basis
upon
which
they
tried
the
case,
but
it
is
in
the
pleadings
and
always
mentioned
by
two
or
three
witnesses.
but
i
like
to
point
out
that
in
this
respect,
all
they
showed
was
the
proximity
to
the
market
and
there
is
utterly
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
that
they
had
any
effect
upon
the
competitors
in
the
market.
so
that
the
mere
physical
proximity,
of
course,
without
any
showing
of,
in
effect,
on
a
better
consumer
market,
doesn’t
show
or
can’t
develop
into
any
blasting
of
competition.
there
were
four
witnesses
for
the
bank,
two
bank
officers
and
two
economists
who
testified
that
commerce,
prior
to
the
announcement
of
the
merger,
exerted
no
influence
at
all
on
the
spokane
market.
with
respect
to
the
washington
state
bank
moving
out
into
other
areas,
i
just
want
to
point
out
that
justice
did
not
try
the
crew
what
banking
markets
or
what
sections
they
might
move
out
into.
they
simply
argue
that
the
bank
has
the
capability
of
expanding
and,
therefore,
its
elimination
would
be
a
lessening
the
competition
under
section
7.
now,
in
conclusion,
i
would
want
to
point
out
that
both
parties
in
the
case
are
urging
what
they
considered
to
be
pro-competitive
action.
what
the
justice
department’s
case
really
boils
down
to
simply
that
they’re
saying
that
it’s
pro-competitive
to
save
commerce
for
some
future
entrant
into
the
market.
we
contend
that
if
we
move
into
the
market
right
now,
a
bigger
bank,
a
much
stronger
bank
that
that
is
also
pro-competitive.
it’s
--
the
trial
court
found
that
the
spokane
banking
market
actually
needs
another
competitor
of
the
size
of
seattle
first.
and
what
i
think
that
the
real
issue
for
this
court
is
to
which
is
the
more
pro-competitive,
is
it
to
say
this
to
the
bank
that
they
might
enter
the
spokane
market
ten
years
from
now,
and
then
maybe
spend
another
ten
years
in
attempting
to
build
their
deposits
to
a
point
where
they
can
actually
compete
or
wouldn’t
it
be
more
pro-competitive
for
them
to
go
in
immediately.
i’d
also
like
to
say
--
mr.
r.
a.
moen
yes
i’m
afraid
i
am.
i
will
bring
my
argument
to
the
close.
thank
you.
