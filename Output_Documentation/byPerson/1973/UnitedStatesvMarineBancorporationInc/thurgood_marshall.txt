mr.
moen
i
am
having
a
little
trouble
with
you
say
you
can
help
the
bank
and
assist
the
new
bank,
but
you
don’t
sponsor
it.
what
do
you
mean
by
sponsor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
which
one
are
you
talking
about?
you
said
there’s
not
a
single
one
of
your
branch
bank
that
you
sponsored,
but
you
did
assist
it.
now,
where
is
the
line
in
your
book?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
just
the
interest
of
building
that
competition?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
loevinger,
you
keep
saying
plaintiff,
who
is
the
plaintiff?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
know
but
your
brief
says
the
united
states
of
america.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
your
brief
said,
your
brief
says
your
brief
is
to
the
comptroller
of
the
currency?
justice
thurgood
marshall
united
states
of
america
is
the
appellant.
but
you
keep
arguing
about
plaintiff,
you
don’t
mean
the
united
states
of
america?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
it’s
more
than
the
formality
because
usually
the
question
up
most
in
my
mind
is
who
represents
“the
united
states
of
america”?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
times
that
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
argued
in
this
court
in
all
of
those
hundreds
of
millions
and
years?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
know
as
of
now
what
the
position
of
the
government
is.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
of
course.
