mr.
friedman,
if
you
lose
on
the
question,
which
you
said
that
it
was
left
open
in
the
falstaff,
is
that
the
end
of
the
case,
as
far
as
you
are
concerned?
do
you
say
this
case
poses
that
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
lose
on
the
question,
should
the
judgment
be
affirmed?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
that’s
all
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
friedman,
even
if
the
acquisition
doesn’t
take
place,
the
fact
of
organization
of
the
new
bank
via
the
efforts
of
an
established
organization
is
undisputed.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
which
is
a
substantial
benefit
in
itself
in
term
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
terms
of
correspondent
advantages
and
things
like
that.
at
least
it
goes
on
all
the
time
and
the
organization
of
other
units
by
an
existing
bank,
whether
is
later
acquired
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
makes
your
point
just
as
well
doesn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it’s
a
new
bank,
it’s
gonna
be
a
new
entry?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
you
about
de
novo
entry,
which
is
much
broader
question
an
entry
by
an
existing
organization.
how
many
new
banks
have
been
organized
in
spokane
in
the
last
ten
years,
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
been
organized
as
started
from
scratch?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
at
55
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
is
no
particular
legal
barriers
to
new
entries
in
the
spokane
area
by
this
new
banking
organization?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
why
do
you
say
mr.
friedman
that
your
point
isn’t
made
as
well
whether
or
not
the
newly
organized
unit
is
later
acquired?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
eliminated,
certainly
is
eliminated
as
a
possible
source
of
the
impetus
and
energy
and
perhaps
support
to
organize
a
new
bank.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a
competitor?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
would
go
back
and
organize
another
one
to
compete
with
its
new
bank
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
doubt
if
the
bank
here
nbc
acquires
the
bank
in
spokane,
which
it
has
or
wants
to,
is
about
to
turnaround
and
organize
another
bank
--
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
it
ever
acquired
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
ask
what
is
the
authority
of
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
authority
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
to
represent
himself
in
this
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
it
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
should
ask
the
department
of
justice
what
there
authority
is,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
friedman,
if
