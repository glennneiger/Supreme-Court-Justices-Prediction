mr.

you

chief

would
you
first
tell
him
mr.

how
that

still
alive?
chief

warren
e.
burger
well,
the
clerk
is
checking
on
it
right
now.
chief

warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
mr.
korman,
your
situation
would
be
any
different
or
would
your
position
be
any
different
if
promptly
on
their
arriving
at
the
station
they
handed
them
substitute
jail
house
clothes.
took
their
regular
clothes,
put
them
in
a
sealed
bag
and
gave
them
receipt
and
then
put
it
in
a
locker
and
then
the
next
morning
went
into
the
locker
and
got
the
clothes
and
sent
them
to
the
laboratory
for
the
chemical
analysis?
chief

warren
e.

but
what
are
the
second
circuit
reasons
if
they
had
the
clothes
already
in
custody
and
they
didn’t
need
a
warrant
to
get
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
what
you’re
saying
in
effect
is
that
they
had
both
the
clothes
and
the
people
in
custody
here
and
they
can
take
the
clothes
anytime
they
wanted
to?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
the
point
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
his
right
of
association
in
prison
is
somewhat
limited
to
jailers
and
fellow
prisoners
for
one
thing
isn’t
it?
but,
i
would
like
to
get
away
from
the
first
and
fifth
amendment
here
and
get
back
to
this
case.
i
understood
your
response
in
an
earlier
point
was
resting
on
the
recent
robinson
case
that
a
custodial
arrest,
that
is
an
arrest
followed
by
custody
is
what
you
were
standing
on
to
support
the
search
and
that’s
what
we
had
just
held
a
few
weeks
ago
on
robinson.

mr.

chief

don’t
you

don’t
you
suppose
the

who
was
entitled

put
the

together
what
he
saw
with
his
eyes
and
what
he
heard
over
the

chief

warren
e.

so
then
you
say
that
that
did
not
add
up
to
probable
cause
to
stop
them
or
arrest
them?
chief

warren
e.

it’s
something
your

filed
in

apparently.
chief

e.

the

checking
it

chief

chief

e.

well,
not
important.
chief

e.

i
suppose
it’s
reasonable

to

you

that
the

chief

well,
let’s
suppose
that
it

perhaps
in

should
be
a

shaken

all
up,
brush

turned
down
his

and
scattered
this
paint

on

and
then
in
the
morning,
they
come
in
with
a
vacuum

and
took
off
all
this

and
found

that
way,
what
would

would
they

chief

let’s
change
this
hypothetical
a
little
bit
then,
instead
of
brushing
his

out,
the
officer
had
come
in,
in
the
morning
with
a
small

this

not

i
need

and
the

from

without

or
anything.
unreasonable
search?
chief

warren
e.

well,
to
pursue
mr.

blackmun’s
question,
suppose
that
making
a
search
of
his
clothes
when
he
comes
into
the
prison
to
be
sure
that
he
is
not
carrying
narcotics
or
any
other
dangerous
material.
they
must
get
a

when

chief

warren
e.

inventory?
do
you
regard
a
search
for
narcotics
as
an
inventory
search?
it’s
not
an
inventory
search
if
the
term
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
these
labels
we
give
are
sometimes
elusive
and
not
thoroughly
reliable
but
routinely
when
a
person
goes
into
a
prison
as
distinguished
from
a
jail
where
he
is
being
awaiting
trial.
he
is
convicted
and
goes
into
a
prison.
there
are
two
things
done
to
him.
there’s
an
inventory
of
everything
he
has
which
is
then
if
it
is
something
not
permitted
is
put
away,
he
is
given
a
receipt
for
it
then
there
is
the
prophylactic
search,
which
is
to
see
if
he
has
any
contraband
weapons,
narcotics,
whatever.
now,
going
back
to
this
prophylactic
search
if
you’ll
stay
with
my
term
to
distinguish
that
from
the
inventory
search,
would
you
say
they
need
a
warrant
to
make
the
prophylactic
search
before
he
goes
into
the
lorton
penitentiary
for
example?
chief
justice
warren
e.

and
if
they
find
the
narcotics,
i
suppose
he
is
in
trouble
of
some
kind
isn’t
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
don’t
have
that
case
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.

what
is
there
about
the
lapse
of
time,
mr.

that
alters
this
situation
that
is,
if
they
had
the
right
to
search
him
within
a
short
time,
reasonable
time
after
arriving
at

station
house?
what
is
it
that
enhances
his
right
of
privacy
or
whatever
other
factors
you
rely
on
to
raise
a
new
barrier
to
the
search?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
one
of
the
things
you
are
relying
on
is
that
in
that
lapse
of
time
he
has
had
an
opportunity
to
dispose
off
the
evidence
but
first
we
know
now
that
he
didn’t
dispose
off
it
and
second,
somewhat
difficult
to
dispose
off
evidence
while
you
are
confined
in
a
cell,
isn’t
it?
chief

warren
e.

then
my
hypothetical
would
bring
the
fellow
in

the
vacuum
cleaner
in
the
morning
and
that
would
somewhat
frustrate
his
effort
to
conceal
the
evidence,
wouldn’t
it?
chief

warren
e.

the
one
reason,
one
reason,
i
already
indicated

itself

that
at
11:30
