when?
how
recently?
when
did

do
you
remember

invalid.

before
you
leave
the

one
thing
that’s
not
clear
to
me

to
ask
you,
were
these
men
given
--
asked
to
discard
their
old
clothing
and
given
new
clothing
as
a
matter
of
routine
jail
procedures
or
were
they
asked
for
their
clothing
for
this
purpose
of
making
this
search?

you
do
not
and

on
this

you
cannot
seek
to
justify
this
search
as
an
inventory
search.
