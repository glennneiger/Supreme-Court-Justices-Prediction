mr.
thomas
r.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
getting
into
the
argument
itself
i
would
like
to
comment
briefly
on
the
facts
as
they
were
indicated
by
mr.
korman.
i
am
afraid
he
exaggerated
in
at
least
one
respect.
first
of
all,
there
may
have
been
the
intimation
that
the
respondent
edwards
was
one
of
the
three
individuals
who
left
the
suspicious
tan
automobile.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
which
indicates
that,
at
no
time,
by
no
person
was
he
identified,
as
one
of
the
human
beings
who
emerged
from
that
automobile.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
in
anyway
associates
him
with
the
now
deceased
respondent
livesay.
nor
is
there
anything
in
the
record
which
indicate
as
i
think
mr.
korman
did
that
when
officer
ashley
first
observed
the
respondent
edwards
and
the
man
huntley
with
whom
he
was
ultimately
arrested
that
he
was
suspicious
of
them.
he
in
fact
was
not
suspicious
of
them,
the
record
is
replete
with
testimony
that
they
acted
in
a
completely
normal
and
un-suspicious
manner.
when
he
observed
them
for
the
first
time,
they
were
already
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
post
office
and
at
the
north
edge
of
the
post
office.
from
that
point
they
walked
one
half
block
north
and
one
half
block
west
in
a
perfectly
normal
manner
until
such
time
as
he
received
the
radio
transmission
advising
him
that
the
post
office
had
been
activated
where
upon
he
apprehended
them,
put
them
in
his
automobile
and
took
them
back
to
the
post
office.
now
there
is
one
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
yes,
he
was.
he
certainly
was
and
that’s
exactly
what
he
did.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
no,
i
don’t
at
this
time
want
to
make
a
serious
argument
about
probable
cause,
that
was
made
in
the
district
court
and
it
was
made
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
made
both
places
unsuccessfully
and
i
frankly
don’t
hold
that
much
hope
of
making
that
argument
successfully
here
so
that
reason
we
did
not
talk
extensively
or
at
all
in
about
that
in
the
brief.
but
those
are
facts
that
the
court
ought
to
consider.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
yes,
we
did
respond
and
to
my
knowledge
we
did,
i
just
don’t
know
at
this
moment
whether
we
affirmatively
raised
the
probable
cause
issue
in
that
response
or
not.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
i
am
sorry.
i
don’t
understand
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
i
think
we
could,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
i
would
hope
so
your
honor
and
for
that
reason
to
the
extent
that
we
can
keep
it
open,
i
would
like
to
keep
open
the
issue
of
probable
cause.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that’s
correct.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
if
it
please
the
court,
i
don’t
know
either.
i
have
never
seen
a
copy
of
it.
i
was
advised
at
lunch.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
i
have
not,
your
honor,
i
became
aware
of
its
possible
existence
for
the
first
time
at
lunch
with
mr.
korman
this
afternoon.
i
have
not
heard
about
it
or
seen
it
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
what
i’d
like
to
really
talk
about
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
warrant
requirement
for
the
search
in
this
case.
the
existing
authority
in
this
court,
it
seems
to
me
makes
it
very
plain.
that
a
search
without
a
warrant,
whether
that
is
a
search
of
a
person
or
of
a
place
is
an
exceptional
search
and
maybe
justified
only
if
the
circumstances
of
that
search
bring
it
within
one
of
the
exceptions
to
the
warrant
required
which
have
been
previously
established
by
this
court.
the
court
said
that
in
peck,
it
said
it
in
katz,
said
it
in
terry
and
as
recently
as
may
of
1973
it
said
that
a
warrantless
search
is
an
exceptional
search
in
schneckloth
and
in
cupp
versus
murphy.
so,
i
think
that
the
court
is
historically
on
record
as
indicating
that
even
in
searches
of
persons,
a
warrantless
search
is
the
exceptional
search
unless
it
comes
within
one
of
the
existing
categories
of
exception.
now
plainly,
one
of
the
existing
categories
of
exception
is
a
search
incident
to
arrest.
this
court
has
always
been
talking
about
what
is
a
search
incident
to
arrest,
require
that
some
time,
relationship
exist
between
the
time
of
arrest
and
the
time
of
search
and
it
has
done
that
properly
because
of
the
reason
for
the
exception.
the
court
has
said
that
the
reason
you
may
search
incident
to
arrest
is
to
one,
protect
the
officer
from
weapons
and
two;
ascertain
the
existence
of
and
preserve
the
destruction
of
evidence,
which
may
be
used
in
prosecution
ultimately
arising
out
of
that
arrest.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
either
of
or
both
of
those
purposes
of
the
exception
no
longer
exists,
then
the
exception
ought
no
longer
exist.
so
that,
if
by
the
mere
passage
of
time,
we
have
defeated
the
purpose
of
the
search
incident
to
arrest
exception
then
that
exception
no
longer
has
application.
now,
the
question
of
a
search
for
weapons
was
never
involved
in
this
case.
this
was
plainly
a
search
for
evidence
and
it
is
not
a
search
to
capture
evidence.
it
is
a
search
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
the
evidence
ever
existed.
the
passage
of
time
we
submit,
the
minimum
of
nine
or
ten
hours
from
the
time
of
arrest
until
the
time
that
the
clothing
was
taken
defeats
the
purpose
of
taking
the
clothing
so
as
to
preserve
evidence.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
it
depends
what
had
happened
in
those
two
hours
if
it
please
the
court.
if
the
defendant
had
been
placed
in
a
jail
cell
by
himself,
unattended
during
which
time
he
may
have
taken
whatever
action
he
wanted
to
with
respect
to
whatever
evidence
there
may
have
been
on
this
person,
i
think
it
would
make
a
difference.
in
the
one
court
of
appeals
case
which
involved
a
delay
of
six
hours,
the
court
was
very
emphatic
in
indicating
that
during
that
entire
period
of
time.
the
defendant
was
physically
in
the
company
and
in
the
custody
of
the
arresting
officers
so
that
there
was
no
intervening
opportunity
for
him
to
dispose
off
the
evidence
that
he
wanted
to.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
i
am
sorry?
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
i
think
that
might
be
the
caruso
case.
but
at
any
rate,
it
was
very
important
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
and
it
based
its
decision
on
the
incident
to
arrest
exception.
it
did
not
say
that
there
was
not
a
blanket
dispensation
from
the
requirement
to
obtain
a
warrant.
it
said
in
this
case,
this
search
was
in
fact
a
search
incident
to
arrest
and
it
was
such
because
it
was
made
during
the
arrest
process,
the
incarceration
process,
the
booking
process
during
all
of
which
time,
the
clothing
of
the
defendant
was
under
the
constant
observation
of
the
arresting
officers
and
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
yes,
i
would
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
argues
against
the
incident
to
arrest
exception.
the
defendant
cannot
be
aware
of
the
fact
of
the
evidence
on
this
person
as
the
police
officers
could
not
have
been
because
of
its
microscopic
size
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
no,
your
honor
because
that’s
not
a
search.
the
person
is
not
a
search
for
his
clothing,
it
is
merely
vacuuming
of
the
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
your
honor,
i
think
he
has
no
privacy
in
that
sense
to
his
place
of
habitation,
we
do
submit
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
yes,
that
would
have
application
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
yes,
but
that
is
plainly
of
course
not
the
case
here.
they
took
the
clothes
from
his
body
solely
for
the
purpose
of
submitting
them
to
a
laboratory
examination.
it
was
not
a
custodial
search,
it
was
not
a
search
in
the
normal
--
it
was
not
a
custodial
taking,
it
was
not
a
taking
in
the
normal
processes
of
the
lebanon
police
department.
it
was
a
taking
under
circumstances
which
we
submit
plainly
do
not
conform
to
the
incident
to
arrest
exception.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that
makes
it
i
think
a
much
more
difficult
question.
it
indicates
what
mr.
justice
stewart
has
said
for
instance
in
chimel
that
whenever
you
draw
a
line
they’re
going
to
be
cases
on
either
side
of
that
line
which
are
really
not
substantially
different
but
it
is
nevertheless
necessary
to
draw
a
line.
i
don’t
know
what
the
answer
would
be
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
no,
i
think
that
our
position
would
be
the
same,
if
the
taking
of
the
clothing
of
an
arrested
person
is
merely
a
custodial
taking.
that
is
if
it’s
taken
only
so
that
the
inner
workings
of
the
police
system
can
be
better
expedite
that
you
would
nonetheless
require
a
warrant
in
that
case.
well
the
reason
that
in
our
view
of
it,
the
mere
fact
of
arrest
is
not
denied
to
the
person
arrested,
his
rights
of
property
or
his
rights
of
privacy
in
his
clothing
so
that
if
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
well,
that’s
a
different,
again
a
different
circumstance
because
the
fact
that
i
would
want
to
emphasize
here
is
that
this
was
not
a
routine
custodial
taking.
this
was
a
taking
for
the
specific
purpose
of
making
a
search
and
was
necessary
for
them
to
go
out
and
purchase
clothing
so
that
substitute
clothing
could
be
held.
i
might
indicate
this,
well,
it
is
not
all
absolutely
clear
from
the
record.
what
they
took
from
edwards
was
a
shirt,
a
sweater,
trousers
and
his
shoes.
what
they
replaced
them
with
was
a
t-shirt
and
a
pair
of
trousers.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
record
but
it
is
the
fact
that
he
was
in
the
jail
for
a
week
without
a
pair
of
shoes
until
his
wife
was
able
to
obtain
a
pair
and
bring
them
to
him.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
it
would
be
if
it
were
taken
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
search,
we
submit
that
a
warrant
would
be
required
although
plainly
in
those
circumstances
it
is
not
taken
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
search.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
no,
your
honor,
that
is
plainly
an
inventory
search.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
your
honor,
i
regard
what
is
a
truly
an
inventory
search
even
though
it
may
result
in
the
location
of
or
the
finding
of
narcotics
is
an
inventory
search,
to
which
historically
the
warrant
requirement
has
no
application.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that’s
right.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
it’s
a
safekeeping
kind
of
taking.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that’s
correct,
your
honor
and
it’s
for
that
reason
that
we
submit
no
warrant
is
required
for
that
kind
of
search.
there
was
however
in
this
case
a
specific
intent
to
search
for
evidence.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
no,
i
would
not
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
just
a
completely
separate
set
of
circumstances
involved
in
searching
men
who
are
in
a
penitentiary
who
have
already
been
convicted
of
a
crime,
then
there
is
in
the
removal
of
clothing
from
a
person
arrested
on
probable
cause,
very
tenuous
probable
cause
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
whether
or
not
there
is
on
his
person
evidence
which
may
involve
him
in
the
matter
of
which
he
has
been
held
and
which
he
is
being
held
on
probable
cause.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
i
am
sure
he
is.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
it
is
exactly
the
same
kind
of
trouble,
yes.
i'd
like
to
comment
briefly,
if
i
may
on
the
notion
to,
on
the
notion
that
somehow
or
other
the
mere
fact
of
an
arrest,
the
mere
fact
that
a
custodial
arrest
somehow
or
other
brings
about
a
substantial
diminution
of
the
arrested
person's
fourth
amendment
rights,
it
seems
to
me
anomalous
that
a
circumstance,
that
is
an
arrest
which
plainly
accentuates
and
puts
into
acute
focus
his
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights,
his
fifth
amendment
rights
to
the
extent
that
the
arresting
officers
must
not
only
honor
them
but
must
in
fact
inform
him
as
to
what
they
are?
that
same
circumstances
enact
to
diminish
what
would
otherwise
be
his
plainly
available
fourth
amendment
rights.
it
seems
to
me
a
little
bit
like
saying
that
if
you
for
somehow
rather
--
for
some
reason
you
have
the
right
to
beat
me
above
the
head
with
a
stick
that
you
by
that
reason
have
the
right
to
stamp
upon
my
toe
and
the
reason
that
you
have
the
right
to
stamp
upon
my
toe
is
that
doesn’t
hurt
as
much
as
beating
me
above
the
head
with
a
stick
does.
i've
never
failed
to
understand
the
thrust
of
the
lesser
intrusion
argument.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
that
kind
of
circumstance.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
but
that
was
plainly,
your
honor,
a
search
incident
to
arrest,
it
was
a
face-to-face
confrontation.
the
entire
search
in
question
at
that
time
was
conducted
immediately
at
the
scene
of
arrest.
there
was
no
time
interval.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
that
it
seems
to
me
though
is
completely
different
from
this
case.
in
my
view,
robinson
has
little
if
anything
to
do
with
this
case
because
robinson
was
plainly
a
search
incident
to
arrest.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
how
does
that
apply
here,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
well
the
notion
of
course
in
chambers
was
that
if
it’s
reasonable
to
make
a
search
at
the
place
of
arrest,
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
transport
the
automobile
to
the
jailhouse
and
there
make
the
search.
i
think
that
chambers
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
it
depends,
your
honor.
when
we
say
he
was
arrested,
if
in
fact
he
was
arrested
at
the
time
that
officer
ashley
put
him
in
his
vehicle
it
would
have
been
totally
unreasonable.
because
at
that
time
all
that
ashley
knew
was
that
he
had
seen
edward
on
the
sidewalk
and
that
the
alarm
had
gone
off
in
the
post
office.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
if
the
record
were
a
little
clearer
as
to
what
the
intent
of
the
lebanon
police
department
was
when
they
took
edwards
to
the
jail,
if
there
was
something
in
the
record
which
indicated
at
that
time.
that
they
had
the
intent
at
that
time
to
search
his
clothing,
then
i
think
that
plainly,
the
search
of
the
clothing
had
they
taken
it
immediately
upon
his
arrival
at
the
station
so
as
to
not
expose
him
to
any
public
embarrassment
would
have
been
reasonable.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that
i
think
could
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that
would
have
been
reasonable,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument,
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
for
the
reason
that
there
was
no,
well
it
would
have
been
unreasonable
to
make
this
kind
of
a
search.
it
would
have
been
unreasonable
to
take
his
clothing
from
him
at
the
scene
of
arrest
for
the
reason
there
was
no
reason
to
do
so.
there
was
problem
cause
whatever.
the
arresting
officer
knew
only
that
he
had
seen
edward
on
the
sidewalk
at
the
post
office
and
that
the
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
well
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
the
reason
that
i
say
that
they
could
not
have
made
this
kind
of
search
at
the
moment
of
edward's
arrest
was
because
that
kind
of
search,
even
using
the
purely
reasonable
application
that
the
government
would
urge
would
have
been
patently
unreasonable.
there
was
simply
no
reason,
no
factual
reason
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
to
take
his
clothing
away
from
him.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
i
think
that
they
could
have
done
that
unless
we
get
into
the
rochin
problem
of
humiliation.
but
if
they
had
taken
him
directly
to
the
station
house
under
those
circumstances,
under
those
facts
that
his
clothing
could
reasonably
have
been
taken
from
him
then.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
it’s
exactly
this.
if
the
warrantless
search
is
in
fact
an
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement,
the
exception
is
rooted
in
the
necessity
or
in
the
value
to
society
generally
of
preserving
evidence.
now
the
evidence
can
only
reasonably
be
preserved
if
the
taking
or
if
the
search
occurs
at
such
a
time
when
you
can
expect
the
evidence
to
be
reasonably
there.
so
that
if
it
is
reasonable
to
search
immediately
upon
arrival
at
the
station
house
because
the
defendant
has
had
no
opportunity
to
disperse
the
evidence
or
to
get
rid
of
it
or
to
destroy
it,
it
becomes
unreasonable
to
search
ten
hours
later
or
five
days
later
or
five
years
later
as
the
government
would
insist
because
he
has
had
during
all
of
that
time,
ample
opportunity
to
dispose
off
the
evidence
and
applying
the
old
laws
school
maxim
that
where
the
reason
for
the
rules
ceases
to
exist,
the
rule
ceases
to
exist.
to
this
situation
we
can
say
that
we
are
the
reason
for
the
exception
of
ceases
to
exist,
the
exception
ought
to
cease
to
exist.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
your
honor,
had
he
been
aware
of
the
fact
of
the
paint
chips
he
may
have
well
taken
his
clothing
and
shaken
them
and
thereby
effectively
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
it
would
totally
frustrate,
client
but
that
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
consideration.
we're
talking
about
the
physical
removal
of
a
persons
clothing
in
our
view
retains
a
privacy
and
property
right
in
that
clothing
without
a
warrant.
i
think
we
could
also,
it
plainly
does
not
do
law
enforcement
any
good.
it
does
not
help
the
practical
workings
of
the
law
enforcement
to
say
that
in
this
circumstance
you
don’t
have
to
have
a
warrant.
they
were
plainly
in
no
rush
to
gather
the
clothing.
they
waited
until
the
next
morning.
they
plainly
had
an
opportunity
to
get
a
warrant.
they
in
fact
did
get
a
warrant
on
the
next
day
for
the
search
of
the
automobile
in
which
livesay
was
arrested.
there
is
no
reason,
it
seems
to
me
why
at
the
same
time
they
got
that
warrant,
they
could
not
have
gotten
a
warrant
for
the
search
of
the
clothing.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
your
honor,
i
think
it’s
a
practical
matter
if
the
lebanon
police
department
really
wanted
that
clothing
at
the
time
of
arrest,
they
would
have
found
some
way
to
get
it
and
some
way
to
obtain
substitute
clothing.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
could
plainly
have
found,
if
nothing
else,
i
am
speculating
now
but
since
they
could
have
found
clothing
among
the
members
of
the
lebanon
police
department
which
to
replace
it.
finally,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
the
requirements
of
law
enforcement
in
this
area
are
amply
fulfilled
by
what
this
court
has
done
in
robinson
with
respect
to
the
extent
of
the
search
that
you
may
make
incident
to
arrest.
you
may
make
a
full
field
search
incident
to
arrest
and
the
legitimate
ends
of
law
enforcement
are
adequately
met
by
that.
you
may
find
whatever
evidence
is
on
the
person,
you
may
find
whatever
weapons
may
be
on
the
person.
in
chimel,
the
court
has
adequately
established
a
range
of
the
search
incident
to
arrest
that
you
may
make
beyond
the
person,
beyond
the
body
of
the
person
arrested.
we
submit
as
this
court
has
said
in
chimel
or
in
coolidge
rather,
in
talking
about
searches
of
automobiles
and
saying
that
the
word
automobile
ought
not
to
be
a
talisman
in
the
presence
of
which
the
fourth
amendment
fades
away
and
disappears,
that
the
word
arrest
likewise
ought
not
to
be
a
talisman
in
the
presence
of
which
the
fourth
amendment
fades
away
and
disappears.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
page
three
of
our
brief
there
is
a
misstatement
of
fact
of
the
second
full
paragraphs
says,
“later
that
evening,
that
is
after
the
defendants
were
transported
to
the--.”
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
it
says
“later
that
evening,
meaning
after
the
defendants
were
already
transported
to
the
jail
and
investigation
by
local
police
authorities
reveal
that
an
attempt
had
been
made
then
to
the
post
office.”
that’s
not
correct,
the
investigation
was
undertaken
immediately
upon
officer
ashley’s
arrival
back
at
the
post
office
with
the
two
gentlemen
and
before
the
defendants
were
actually
transported
to
jail
and
in
the
first
full
paragraph
where
we
say
respondent
edwards
was
arrested
with
a
companion
as
he
walked
away
from
the
post
office.
our
officer
ashley
testified
that
he
didn’t
formally
place
them
under
arrest
and
so
advised
them
until
after
he
had
determined
to
the
satisfaction
that
in
fact
the
attempt
had
actually
been
made
to
break
into
the
post
office
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
there
are
two
record
references,
the
appendix
pages
9
to
10
and
in
the
transcript
of
the
suppression
minutes
at
page
15.
and
it
would
be
our
position
that
the
actual
arrest
took
place
after
the
officer
got
satisfied
himself
that
in
fact
the
burglary
had
have
a
--
that
the
post
office
window
had
actually
been
broken
into
and
that
when
he
originally
picked
them
up,
it
was
simply
a
brief
custodial
detention.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
getting
into
the
argument
itself
i
would
like
to
comment
briefly
on
the
facts
as
they
were
indicated
by
mr.
korman.
i
am
afraid
he
exaggerated
in
at
least
one
respect.
first
of
all,
there
may
have
been
the
intimation
that
the
respondent
edwards
was
one
of
the
three
individuals
who
left
the
suspicious
tan
automobile.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
which
indicates
that,
at
no
time,
by
no
person
was
he
identified,
as
one
of
the
human
beings
who
emerged
from
that
automobile.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
in
anyway
associates
him
with
the
now
deceased
respondent
livesay.
nor
is
there
anything
in
the
record
which
indicate
as
i
think
mr.
korman
did
that
when
officer
ashley
first
observed
the
respondent
edwards
and
the
man
huntley
with
whom
he
was
ultimately
arrested
that
he
was
suspicious
of
them.
he
in
fact
was
not
suspicious
of
them,
the
record
is
replete
with
testimony
that
they
acted
in
a
completely
normal
and
un-suspicious
manner.
when
he
observed
them
for
the
first
time,
they
were
already
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
the
post
office
and
at
the
north
edge
of
the
post
office.
from
that
point
they
walked
one
half
block
north
and
one
half
block
west
in
a
perfectly
normal
manner
until
such
time
as
he
received
the
radio
transmission
advising
him
that
the
post
office
had
been
activated
where
upon
he
apprehended
them,
put
them
in
his
automobile
and
took
them
back
to
the
post
office.
now
there
is
one
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
yes,
he
was.
he
certainly
was
and
that’s
exactly
what
he
did.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
no,
i
don’t
at
this
time
want
to
make
a
serious
argument
about
probable
cause,
that
was
made
in
the
district
court
and
it
was
made
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
was
made
both
places
unsuccessfully
and
i
frankly
don’t
hold
that
much
hope
of
making
that
argument
successfully
here
so
that
reason
we
did
not
talk
extensively
or
at
all
in
about
that
in
the
brief.
but
those
are
facts
that
the
court
ought
to
consider.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
yes,
we
did
respond
and
to
my
knowledge
we
did,
i
just
don’t
know
at
this
moment
whether
we
affirmatively
raised
the
probable
cause
issue
in
that
response
or
not.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
i
am
sorry.
i
don’t
understand
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
i
think
we
could,
your
honor
and
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
i
would
hope
so
your
honor
and
for
that
reason
to
the
extent
that
we
can
keep
it
open,
i
would
like
to
keep
open
the
issue
of
probable
cause.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that’s
correct.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
if
it
please
the
court,
i
don’t
know
either.
i
have
never
seen
a
copy
of
it.
i
was
advised
at
lunch.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
i
have
not,
your
honor,
i
became
aware
of
its
possible
existence
for
the
first
time
at
lunch
with
mr.
korman
this
afternoon.
i
have
not
heard
about
it
or
seen
it
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
what
i’d
like
to
really
talk
about
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
warrant
requirement
for
the
search
in
this
case.
the
existing
authority
in
this
court,
it
seems
to
me
makes
it
very
plain.
that
a
search
without
a
warrant,
whether
that
is
a
search
of
a
person
or
of
a
place
is
an
exceptional
search
and
maybe
justified
only
if
the
circumstances
of
that
search
bring
it
within
one
of
the
exceptions
to
the
warrant
required
which
have
been
previously
established
by
this
court.
the
court
said
that
in
peck,
it
said
it
in
katz,
said
it
in
terry
and
as
recently
as
may
of
1973
it
said
that
a
warrantless
search
is
an
exceptional
search
in
schneckloth
and
in
cupp
versus
murphy.
so,
i
think
that
the
court
is
historically
on
record
as
indicating
that
even
in
searches
of
persons,
a
warrantless
search
is
the
exceptional
search
unless
it
comes
within
one
of
the
existing
categories
of
exception.
now
plainly,
one
of
the
existing
categories
of
exception
is
a
search
incident
to
arrest.
this
court
has
always
been
talking
about
what
is
a
search
incident
to
arrest,
require
that
some
time,
relationship
exist
between
the
time
of
arrest
and
the
time
of
search
and
it
has
done
that
properly
because
of
the
reason
for
the
exception.
the
court
has
said
that
the
reason
you
may
search
incident
to
arrest
is
to
one,
protect
the
officer
from
weapons
and
two;
ascertain
the
existence
of
and
preserve
the
destruction
of
evidence,
which
may
be
used
in
prosecution
ultimately
arising
out
of
that
arrest.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
either
of
or
both
of
those
purposes
of
the
exception
no
longer
exists,
then
the
exception
ought
no
longer
exist.
so
that,
if
by
the
mere
passage
of
time,
we
have
defeated
the
purpose
of
the
search
incident
to
arrest
exception
then
that
exception
no
longer
has
application.
now,
the
question
of
a
search
for
weapons
was
never
involved
in
this
case.
this
was
plainly
a
search
for
evidence
and
it
is
not
a
search
to
capture
evidence.
it
is
a
search
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
the
evidence
ever
existed.
the
passage
of
time
we
submit,
the
minimum
of
nine
or
ten
hours
from
the
time
of
arrest
until
the
time
that
the
clothing
was
taken
defeats
the
purpose
of
taking
the
clothing
so
as
to
preserve
evidence.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
it
depends
what
had
happened
in
those
two
hours
if
it
please
the
court.
if
the
defendant
had
been
placed
in
a
jail
cell
by
himself,
unattended
during
which
time
he
may
have
taken
whatever
action
he
wanted
to
with
respect
to
whatever
evidence
there
may
have
been
on
this
person,
i
think
it
would
make
a
difference.
in
the
one
court
of
appeals
case
which
involved
a
delay
of
six
hours,
the
court
was
very
emphatic
in
indicating
that
during
that
entire
period
of
time.
the
defendant
was
physically
in
the
company
and
in
the
custody
of
the
arresting
officers
so
that
there
was
no
intervening
opportunity
for
him
to
dispose
off
the
evidence
that
he
wanted
to.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
i
am
sorry?
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
i
am
not
sure.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
i
think
that
might
be
the
caruso
case.
but
at
any
rate,
it
was
very
important
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
case
and
it
based
its
decision
on
the
incident
to
arrest
exception.
it
did
not
say
that
there
was
not
a
blanket
dispensation
from
the
requirement
to
obtain
a
warrant.
it
said
in
this
case,
this
search
was
in
fact
a
search
incident
to
arrest
and
it
was
such
because
it
was
made
during
the
arrest
process,
the
incarceration
process,
the
booking
process
during
all
of
which
time,
the
clothing
of
the
defendant
was
under
the
constant
observation
of
the
arresting
officers
and
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
yes,
i
would
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
argues
against
the
incident
to
arrest
exception.
the
defendant
cannot
be
aware
of
the
fact
of
the
evidence
on
this
person
as
the
police
officers
could
not
have
been
because
of
its
microscopic
size
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
no,
your
honor
because
that’s
not
a
search.
the
person
is
not
a
search
for
his
clothing,
it
is
merely
vacuuming
of
the
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
your
honor,
i
think
he
has
no
privacy
in
that
sense
to
his
place
of
habitation,
we
do
submit
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
yes,
that
would
have
application
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
yes,
but
that
is
plainly
of
course
not
the
case
here.
they
took
the
clothes
from
his
body
solely
for
the
purpose
of
submitting
them
to
a
laboratory
examination.
it
was
not
a
custodial
search,
it
was
not
a
search
in
the
normal
--
it
was
not
a
custodial
taking,
it
was
not
a
taking
in
the
normal
processes
of
the
lebanon
police
department.
it
was
a
taking
under
circumstances
which
we
submit
plainly
do
not
conform
to
the
incident
to
arrest
exception.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that
makes
it
i
think
a
much
more
difficult
question.
it
indicates
what
mr.
justice
stewart
has
said
for
instance
in
chimel
that
whenever
you
draw
a
line
they’re
going
to
be
cases
on
either
side
of
that
line
which
are
really
not
substantially
different
but
it
is
nevertheless
necessary
to
draw
a
line.
i
don’t
know
what
the
answer
would
be
in
that
particular
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
no,
i
think
that
our
position
would
be
the
same,
if
the
taking
of
the
clothing
of
an
arrested
person
is
merely
a
custodial
taking.
that
is
if
it’s
taken
only
so
that
the
inner
workings
of
the
police
system
can
be
better
expedite
that
you
would
nonetheless
require
a
warrant
in
that
case.
well
the
reason
that
in
our
view
of
it,
the
mere
fact
of
arrest
is
not
denied
to
the
person
arrested,
his
rights
of
property
or
his
rights
of
privacy
in
his
clothing
so
that
if
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
well,
that’s
a
different,
again
a
different
circumstance
because
the
fact
that
i
would
want
to
emphasize
here
is
that
this
was
not
a
routine
custodial
taking.
this
was
a
taking
for
the
specific
purpose
of
making
a
search
and
was
necessary
for
them
to
go
out
and
purchase
clothing
so
that
substitute
clothing
could
be
held.
i
might
indicate
this,
well,
it
is
not
all
absolutely
clear
from
the
record.
what
they
took
from
edwards
was
a
shirt,
a
sweater,
trousers
and
his
shoes.
what
they
replaced
them
with
was
a
t-shirt
and
a
pair
of
trousers.
it
is
not
a
matter
of
record
but
it
is
the
fact
that
he
was
in
the
jail
for
a
week
without
a
pair
of
shoes
until
his
wife
was
able
to
obtain
a
pair
and
bring
them
to
him.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
it
would
be
if
it
were
taken
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
search,
we
submit
that
a
warrant
would
be
required
although
plainly
in
those
circumstances
it
is
not
taken
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
search.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
no,
your
honor,
that
is
plainly
an
inventory
search.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
your
honor,
i
regard
what
is
a
truly
an
inventory
search
even
though
it
may
result
in
the
location
of
or
the
finding
of
narcotics
is
an
inventory
search,
to
which
historically
the
warrant
requirement
has
no
application.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that’s
right.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
it’s
a
safekeeping
kind
of
taking.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that’s
correct,
your
honor
and
it’s
for
that
reason
that
we
submit
no
warrant
is
required
for
that
kind
of
search.
there
was
however
in
this
case
a
specific
intent
to
search
for
evidence.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
no,
i
would
not
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
just
a
completely
separate
set
of
circumstances
involved
in
searching
men
who
are
in
a
penitentiary
who
have
already
been
convicted
of
a
crime,
then
there
is
in
the
removal
of
clothing
from
a
person
arrested
on
probable
cause,
very
tenuous
probable
cause
for
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
whether
or
not
there
is
on
his
person
evidence
which
may
involve
him
in
the
matter
of
which
he
has
been
held
and
which
he
is
being
held
on
probable
cause.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
i
am
sure
he
is.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
it
is
exactly
the
same
kind
of
trouble,
yes.
i'd
like
to
comment
briefly,
if
i
may
on
the
notion
to,
on
the
notion
that
somehow
or
other
the
mere
fact
of
an
arrest,
the
mere
fact
that
a
custodial
arrest
somehow
or
other
brings
about
a
substantial
diminution
of
the
arrested
person's
fourth
amendment
rights,
it
seems
to
me
anomalous
that
a
circumstance,
that
is
an
arrest
which
plainly
accentuates
and
puts
into
acute
focus
his
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights,
his
fifth
amendment
rights
to
the
extent
that
the
arresting
officers
must
not
only
honor
them
but
must
in
fact
inform
him
as
to
what
they
are?
that
same
circumstances
enact
to
diminish
what
would
otherwise
be
his
plainly
available
fourth
amendment
rights.
it
seems
to
me
a
little
bit
like
saying
that
if
you
for
somehow
rather
--
for
some
reason
you
have
the
right
to
beat
me
above
the
head
with
a
stick
that
you
by
that
reason
have
the
right
to
stamp
upon
my
toe
and
the
reason
that
you
have
the
right
to
stamp
upon
my
toe
is
that
doesn’t
hurt
as
much
as
beating
me
above
the
head
with
a
stick
does.
i've
never
failed
to
understand
the
thrust
of
the
lesser
intrusion
argument.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
that
kind
of
circumstance.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
but
that
was
plainly,
your
honor,
a
search
incident
to
arrest,
it
was
a
face-to-face
confrontation.
the
entire
search
in
question
at
that
time
was
conducted
immediately
at
the
scene
of
arrest.
there
was
no
time
interval.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
that
it
seems
to
me
though
is
completely
different
from
this
case.
in
my
view,
robinson
has
little
if
anything
to
do
with
this
case
because
robinson
was
plainly
a
search
incident
to
arrest.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
how
does
that
apply
here,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
well
the
notion
of
course
in
chambers
was
that
if
it’s
reasonable
to
make
a
search
at
the
place
of
arrest,
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
transport
the
automobile
to
the
jailhouse
and
there
make
the
search.
i
think
that
chambers
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
it
depends,
your
honor.
when
we
say
he
was
arrested,
if
in
fact
he
was
arrested
at
the
time
that
officer
ashley
put
him
in
his
vehicle
it
would
have
been
totally
unreasonable.
because
at
that
time
all
that
ashley
knew
was
that
he
had
seen
edward
on
the
sidewalk
and
that
the
alarm
had
gone
off
in
the
post
office.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
if
the
record
were
a
little
clearer
as
to
what
the
intent
of
the
lebanon
police
department
was
when
they
took
edwards
to
the
jail,
if
there
was
something
in
the
record
which
indicated
at
that
time.
that
they
had
the
intent
at
that
time
to
search
his
clothing,
then
i
think
that
plainly,
the
search
of
the
clothing
had
they
taken
it
immediately
upon
his
arrival
at
the
station
so
as
to
not
expose
him
to
any
public
embarrassment
would
have
been
reasonable.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that
i
think
could
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
that
would
have
been
reasonable,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
for
the
purpose
of
this
argument,
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
for
the
reason
that
there
was
no,
well
it
would
have
been
unreasonable
to
make
this
kind
of
a
search.
it
would
have
been
unreasonable
to
take
his
clothing
from
him
at
the
scene
of
arrest
for
the
reason
there
was
no
reason
to
do
so.
there
was
problem
cause
whatever.
the
arresting
officer
knew
only
that
he
had
seen
edward
on
the
sidewalk
at
the
post
office
and
that
the
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
well
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
the
reason
that
i
say
that
they
could
not
have
made
this
kind
of
search
at
the
moment
of
edward's
arrest
was
because
that
kind
of
search,
even
using
the
purely
reasonable
application
that
the
government
would
urge
would
have
been
patently
unreasonable.
there
was
simply
no
reason,
no
factual
reason
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
to
take
his
clothing
away
from
him.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
i
think
that
they
could
have
done
that
unless
we
get
into
the
rochin
problem
of
humiliation.
but
if
they
had
taken
him
directly
to
the
station
house
under
those
circumstances,
under
those
facts
that
his
clothing
could
reasonably
have
been
taken
from
him
then.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
it’s
exactly
this.
if
the
warrantless
search
is
in
fact
an
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement,
the
exception
is
rooted
in
the
necessity
or
in
the
value
to
society
generally
of
preserving
evidence.
now
the
evidence
can
only
reasonably
be
preserved
if
the
taking
or
if
the
search
occurs
at
such
a
time
when
you
can
expect
the
evidence
to
be
reasonably
there.
so
that
if
it
is
reasonable
to
search
immediately
upon
arrival
at
the
station
house
because
the
defendant
has
had
no
opportunity
to
disperse
the
evidence
or
to
get
rid
of
it
or
to
destroy
it,
it
becomes
unreasonable
to
search
ten
hours
later
or
five
days
later
or
five
years
later
as
the
government
would
insist
because
he
has
had
during
all
of
that
time,
ample
opportunity
to
dispose
off
the
evidence
and
applying
the
old
laws
school
maxim
that
where
the
reason
for
the
rules
ceases
to
exist,
the
rule
ceases
to
exist.
to
this
situation
we
can
say
that
we
are
the
reason
for
the
exception
of
ceases
to
exist,
the
exception
ought
to
cease
to
exist.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
your
honor,
had
he
been
aware
of
the
fact
of
the
paint
chips
he
may
have
well
taken
his
clothing
and
shaken
them
and
thereby
effectively
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
it
would
totally
frustrate,
client
but
that
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
consideration.
we're
talking
about
the
physical
removal
of
a
persons
clothing
in
our
view
retains
a
privacy
and
property
right
in
that
clothing
without
a
warrant.
i
think
we
could
also,
it
plainly
does
not
do
law
enforcement
any
good.
it
does
not
help
the
practical
workings
of
the
law
enforcement
to
say
that
in
this
circumstance
you
don’t
have
to
have
a
warrant.
they
were
plainly
in
no
rush
to
gather
the
clothing.
they
waited
until
the
next
morning.
they
plainly
had
an
opportunity
to
get
a
warrant.
they
in
fact
did
get
a
warrant
on
the
next
day
for
the
search
of
the
automobile
in
which
livesay
was
arrested.
there
is
no
reason,
it
seems
to
me
why
at
the
same
time
they
got
that
warrant,
they
could
not
have
gotten
a
warrant
for
the
search
of
the
clothing.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
your
honor,
i
think
it’s
a
practical
matter
if
the
lebanon
police
department
really
wanted
that
clothing
at
the
time
of
arrest,
they
would
have
found
some
way
to
get
it
and
some
way
to
obtain
substitute
clothing.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
could
plainly
have
found,
if
nothing
else,
i
am
speculating
now
but
since
they
could
have
found
clothing
among
the
members
of
the
lebanon
police
department
which
to
replace
it.
finally,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
think
that
the
requirements
of
law
enforcement
in
this
area
are
amply
fulfilled
by
what
this
court
has
done
in
robinson
with
respect
to
the
extent
of
the
search
that
you
may
make
incident
to
arrest.
you
may
make
a
full
field
search
incident
to
arrest
and
the
legitimate
ends
of
law
enforcement
are
adequately
met
by
that.
you
may
find
whatever
evidence
is
on
the
person,
you
may
find
whatever
weapons
may
be
on
the
person.
in
chimel,
the
court
has
adequately
established
a
range
of
the
search
incident
to
arrest
that
you
may
make
beyond
the
person,
beyond
the
body
of
the
person
arrested.
we
submit
as
this
court
has
said
in
chimel
or
in
coolidge
rather,
in
talking
about
searches
of
automobiles
and
saying
that
the
word
automobile
ought
not
to
be
a
talisman
in
the
presence
of
which
the
fourth
amendment
fades
away
and
disappears,
that
the
word
arrest
likewise
ought
not
to
be
a
talisman
in
the
presence
of
which
the
fourth
amendment
fades
away
and
disappears.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
page
three
of
our
brief
there
is
a
misstatement
of
fact
of
the
second
full
paragraphs
says,
“later
that
evening,
that
is
after
the
defendants
were
transported
to
the--.”
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
it
says
“later
that
evening,
meaning
after
the
defendants
were
already
transported
to
the
jail
and
investigation
by
local
police
authorities
reveal
that
an
attempt
had
been
made
then
to
the
post
office.”
that’s
not
correct,
the
investigation
was
undertaken
immediately
upon
officer
ashley’s
arrival
back
at
the
post
office
with
the
two
gentlemen
and
before
the
defendants
were
actually
transported
to
jail
and
in
the
first
full
paragraph
where
we
say
respondent
edwards
was
arrested
with
a
companion
as
he
walked
away
from
the
post
office.
our
officer
ashley
testified
that
he
didn’t
formally
place
them
under
arrest
and
so
advised
them
until
after
he
had
determined
to
the
satisfaction
that
in
fact
the
attempt
had
actually
been
made
to
break
into
the
post
office
--
mr.
thomas
r.
smith
there
are
two
record
references,
the
appendix
pages
9
to
10
and
in
the
transcript
of
the
suppression
minutes
at
page
15.
and
it
would
be
our
position
that
the
actual
arrest
took
place
after
the
officer
got
satisfied
himself
that
in
fact
the
burglary
had
have
a
--
that
the
post
office
window
had
actually
been
broken
into
and
that
when
he
originally
picked
them
up,
it
was
simply
a
brief
custodial
detention.
