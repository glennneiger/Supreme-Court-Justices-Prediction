mr.
edward
r.
korman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
to
the
sixth
circuit.
that
court
refers
judgments
of
conviction
entered
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
ohio
convicting
eugene
h.
edwards
and
the
late
william
t.
livesay
who
died
subsequent
to
the
granting
of
the
writ
of
attempting
to
break
into
the
united
states
post
office
in
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
section
2115.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
certain
scientific
evidence
which
established
that
paint
chips
which
were
found
on
the
clothing
of
both
of
these
gentlemen
came
from
the
same
source
as
paint
chips
on
the
window
of
the
post
office
where
the
attempted
burglary
had
taken
place,
and
that
this
evidence
was
the
fruit
of
the
unlawful
taking
of
the
clothing
of
these
two
gentlemen
some
10
hours
after
their
arrest
on
the
morning
following
their
arrest.
although
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
arrest
of
mr.
edwards
was
lawful,
did
not
in
fact
reach
the
issue
as
to
mr.
livesay
and
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
take
the
clothing.
it
held
that
the
taking
was
fatally
defective
because
a
warrant
had
not
been
obtained
for
the
search
and
seizure
of
the
clothing.
the
issue
presented
here
as
to
whether
the
authority
to
search
an
individual
without
a
warrant
or
an
independent
showing
of
probable
cause
which
arises
by
virtue
of
his
lawful
arrest
is
somehow
dissipated,
if
it
is
not
exercised
“substantially
contemporaneously
with
the
arrest,”
but
several
hours,
in
this
case
approximately
nine,
after
the
administrative
process
and
other
mechanics
of
the
arrest
have
come
to
a
halt.
since
there
is
in
this
case
a
lingering
issue
as
to
the
validity
of
the
underlying
arrest
raised
by
implication
in
the
brief
that’s
been
filed
by
the
respondent
and
expressly
by
mr.
edwards
in
a
separate
document
which
he
has
filed
with
this
court
entitled
the
motion
for
extension
of
time
for
filing
a
writ
of
certiorari.
it
is
appropriate,
i
think
to
begin
the
discussion
of
the
facts
in
this
case
where
it
all
began
on
the
evening
of
may
31st
in
the
year
1971,
in
the
city
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well
presumably,
it
has
been
raised
as
an
alternative
grounds
for
affirmance,
although
it
was
not
raised
as
an
issue
on
our
petition
for
certiorari
that
was
raised,
as
i
understand
it
in
the
opposing
papers
on
certiorari.
but
nevertheless,
i
think
it
would
still
be
helpful
to
start
this
case
where
it
began
in
lebanon,
ohio
around
10:45
in
the
evening
on
may
31,
1970.
at
this
point,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
a
map
which
is
on
page
1
of
a
supplemental
appendix
which
we
filed
yesterday
and
which
might
be
helpful
at
the
court
had
while
i
discuss
the
facts,
in
the
event
that
it
had
not
yet
been
distributed.
i
gave
nine
copies
to
the
clerk
right
now
and
you
might
be
able
to
distribute
it.
i
said
yesterday,
we
filed
a
supplemental
appendix
which
contained
a
map
of
the
area.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes.
the
map
is
the
map
of
approximately
two
or
three
square
blocks
and
around
10:45
in
the
evening
at
10th
plymouth
pulled
up
at
south
sycamore
street
which
is
a
block
from
the
lebanon
post
office
and
parked
at
number
124
south
sycamore
street.
three
gentlemen
emerged,
took
something
out
of
the
trunk
of
the
vehicle
and
began
walking
towards
the
business
district.
this
scene
was
viewed
by
several
people
who
were
sitting
on
the
porch
or
looking
out
of
their
windows.
one
of
them
called
the
police
and
told
them
that
three
strange
persons
had
been
seen
emerging
from
this
stand,
plymouth.
this
is
generally
a
business
district
except
for
this
brief,
small
residential
area
and
a
bulletin
went
out
that
three
suspicious
persons
had
been
observed
leaving
this
town
on
an
automobile.
at
that
point
and
time,
patrolman
ashley
was
cruising
on
south
street
which
is
right
around
the
corner
towards
the
bottom
of
the
map.
he
proceeded
to
examine
the
plymouth,
saw
nothing
particularly
unusual
about
it
except
that
it
had
an
out-of-county
license
plate.
he
then
drove
around
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
out-of-county
license
plates,
apparently
in
ohio,
each
county,
--
the
residents
of
each
county
get
license
plates
with
a
particular
letter
on
the
license
number
to
indicate
the
county
in
which
the
automobile
is
registered.
seeing
nothing
particularly
unusual
other
than
this,
patrolman
ashley
drove
his
car
around
up
south
sycamore
street
north,
he
made
then
a
right
turn
onto
west
main
street,
and
then
you
see
the
alley
on
west
main
street.
he
drove
down
the
alley,
into
the
driveway
of
the
lebanon
post
office.
he
then
drove
through
the
driveway
and
now
to
south
broadway.
as
he
got
to
the
past
the
post
office
he
turned
north
and
he
saw
two
individuals
on
the
north
boundary
of
the
lebanon
post
office
near
the
museum.
it
appeared
to
him
that
they
were
walking
in
a
north,
northeasterly
direction
that
they
had
just
come
from
that
portion
of
the
post
office
and
being
perhaps
naturally
suspicious
since
this
was
10:30
at
night
in
the
business
district,
which
was
not
on
a
sunday
night,
which
was
not
to
his
knowledge
terribly
crowded
with
people.
he
decided
to
follow
them
and
so
as
they
walked,
he
drove
behind
them,
and
they
made
a
turn
on
west
main
street
to
begin
walking
towards
south
sycamore.
and
by
the
time,
agent
ashley
had
gone
to
west
main
street
over
the
radio
of
his
car
he
heard
that
the
burglar
alarm
had
been
sounded
at
the
post
office.
he
there
upon
stopped
these
two
gentlemen,
asked
them
to
get
into
his
car
which
they
did
without
drawing
the
revolver
and
then
he
drove
back
to
the
post
office,
got
out
of
the
car,
by
that
time
other
police
officers
had
arrived
on
the
scene.
he
examined
the
bank
and
the
area
right
where
he
had
seen
these
gentlemen
emerged
from
and
discovered
that
in
fact
there
had
been
an
attempted
burglary.
there
were
burglar’s
tools,
the
screen
had
apparently
been
tampered
with
and
also
he
noticed
paint
chips
near
the
area
as
well,
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
he
told
these
gentlemen
that
they
were
under
arrest
and
they
were
taken
into
custody.
now
these
two
gentlemen
were
mr.
edwards,
who
was
a
respondent
here
and
one
huntley,
who
was
not
convicted
of
this
crime
because
he
jumped
bail
and
ultimately
plead
guilty
to
bail
jumping
rather
than
the
particular
offense
here.
at
the
time
all
of
this
was
transpiring,
the
defendant
livesay
was
observed
back
on
118
sycamore
street
hopping
over
the
back
fence
and
hiding
in
the
bushes
at
118
south
sycamore
street.
he
had
been
observed
by
a
mr.
cruise
who
lived
in
the
house
and
who
had
earlier
was
one
of
the
neighbors
who
had
observed
this
three
gentlemen
emerged
from
the
plymouth.
he
then
saw
mr.
livesay
run
towards
the
plymouth
and
hide
in
the
plymouth
where
mr.
livesay
was
ultimately
discovered
by
another
patrolman
who
placed
him
under
arrest
and
brought
him
to
the
scene
of
the
crime.
after
these
gentlemen
were
placed
in
custody,
this
is
now
and
taken
into
the
station
house,
this
is
approximately
now
about
11:30
on
a
sunday
night.
they
were
placed
in
custody
and
the
following
morning,
the
police
having
noticed
the
paint
chips
near
the
window
with
police
--
went
to
a
local
department
store
called
kaufman’s
department
store
and
purchased
new
clothing
for
these
gentlemen,
went
to
the
prison
sometime
around
9:30
of
the
local
jail,
asked
the
two
men
to
change
into
the
clothing,
which
had
been
purchased.
the
clothing
that
they
were
wearing
had
been
taken
from
them
and
that
of
course
the
scientific
analysis
which
followed
clearly
established
that
the
paint
chips
that
were
found
on
their
clothing
came
from
the
same
source
as
the
paint
chips
from
the
window
of
the
post
office.
and
prior
the
trial,
a
motion
to
suppress
was
made
and
i
note
only
for
the
purposes
of
information
amounting
to
suppress
only
dealt
with
the
probable
cause
aspect
and
did
not
involve
the
issue
that
was
ultimately
raised
and
decided
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals.
at
trial
the
evidence
was
as
i
described
it,
the
observations
of
the
patrolmen,
the
neighbors
in
the
surrounding
area,
and
of
course
the
testimony
of
two
scientific
--
two
people
who
made
the
scientific
analysis.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
we
received
the
copy
of
the
document
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
petition
or
application
for
an
extension
of
time
to
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
several
weeks
ago,
i
have
my
copy
here,
it
was
handwritten.
we
received
a
copy,
i
looked
through
the
court’s
file
yesterday
in
the
docket
room
and
i
did
not
notice
it
among
the
papers
there.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
now
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
rather
exhaustive
opinion
rejected
the
argument
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
held
that
the
police
officers
acted.
it’s
a
reasonable
proof
and
then
should
have
under
the
circumstances.
however,
it
held
that
the
seizure
of
the
clothing,
some
ten
hours
after
the
arrest
was
invalid.
the
court
reasoned
that
since
the
arrest
was
not
contemporaneous
--
the
search
was
not
contemporaneous
with
the
arrest.
it
could
not
be
justified
as
a
“search
incident
to
an
arrest.”
and
struck
down
the
taking
of
the
clothing
because
there
was
no
warrant
even
though
as
i
indicated
earlier
found
probable
cause
to
justify
the
actual
taking
of
the
pants
independent
of
the
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
we
have
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
not
only
because
of
the
conflict
among
the
circuits
but
the
importance
of
the
issue
in
both
federal
and
state
prosecutions
and
indeed
we
have
been
advised
by
the
attorney
general
of
ohio
that
a
predictable
spate
of
habeas
corpus
litigation
has
already
begun
that
in
the
southern
district
of
ohio
alone,
two
habeas
corpus
petitions
have
already
been
granted
in
the
dean
versus
gray
and
carpenter
versus
gray
and
are
pending
before
the
sixth
circuit
and
there
is
yet
another
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
a
case
called
huskinson
versus
grey
raising
the
same
issue
as
involved
in
this
case
and
the
sixth
circuit.
principle
error
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
that
question
was
put
to
the
police
officer
who
was
in
charge
and
he
started
to
answer
what
they
do
generally
and
then
he
stopped
himself
and
he
said,
“do
you
mean
generally
or
what
did
we
do
in
this
case?”
whereupon
they
said
was,
“well,
what
did
you
do
in
this
case?”
and
he
said
that
they
took
it
the
morning
after
apparently
with
the
expressed
purpose
in
mind
not
of
holding
it
for
inventory
or
exchanging
it
for
a
jail
clothing.
apparently,
they
had
no
jail
clothing
since
they
had
to
go
out
and
purchase
this
clothing
and
so
that
it
was
taken
with
the
expressed
purpose
of
conducting
the
analysis
that
was
ultimately
conducted.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
think
i
believe
that
we
would
although
there
is
a
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
called
brett
versus
the
united
states
in
which
that
had
been
done
and
the
clothing
was
i
believe,
deposited
and
held
for
about
three
days
afterwards.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
you
cannot
take
the
clothing
three
days
afterward
even
though
it
had
already
been
taken
from
the
defendants
without
warrant.
it’s
our
view
as
i
shall
elaborate
that
it
is
the,
as
the
court
observed
in
the
robinson
case
it
is
the
fact
of
the
arrest
which
gives
rise
to
the
right
to
seize
and
take
clothing
and
under
those
circumstances.
it
doesn’t
matter
and
there
is
no
reasonable
basis
to
draw
a
distinction
between
takings
which
occurred
five
minutes
after
the
arrest
or
five
hours
after
the
arrest.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
and
no
attempt
was
made
to
do
that
below.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
it’s
not.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct
and
there
was
no
apparently,
the
only
evidence
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
right
and
there
was
no
other
clothing
in
the
prison,
so
apparently
they
went
out
and
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
exactly
and
part
of
it
--
and
by
the
way,
part
of
the
reason
for
the
delay
of
ten
hours
could
have
been
reduced
to
about
two
hours
was
that
they
decided
to
wait
until
morning
to
buy
them
a
new
pair
of
clothing
before
they
actually
made
them
undress
in
the
prison
and
give
up
the
clothing
that
they’re
wearing.
so
that
this
is
a
clear
case
on
which
police
officers
acted
reasonably
under
any
definition
of
the
term
and
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
acted
unreasonably
is
really
based
we
believe
on
a
mistaken
reliance
on
cases
involving
search
incident
to
an
arrest
which
involves
searches
of
homes
and
other
similar
areas
where
a
defendant
happened
to
be
arrested
in
his
house
and
under
those
circumstances
it
was
held
that
an
arrest,
which
was,
when
you
arrest
someone
in
his
house
you
can’t
go
search
the
whole
house
because
of
the
fortuitous
circumstance
that
you
happen
to
have
arrested
him
there
and
of
course
in
some
instances,
the
circumstance
was
not
just
fortuitous
but
the
police
knowing
that
they’d
be
able
to
search
a
whole
house
if
they
happened
to
find
the
defendant
there
to
arrest
him
with
the
plan
to
arrest
accordingly.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
oh,
i
think
it
would
be
different
and
should
be
different
but
i
am
not
sure
that
the
sixth
circuit
would
think
so.
they
expressly
reject
it
for
example
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
which
something
precisely
like
that
had
been
done
and
six
hours
after
the
clothing
had
actually
been
taken
from
the
defendants,
the
fbi
picked
up
the
clothing
to
conduct
scientific
samples.
and
the
second
circuit
said,
“that’s
perfectly
all
right”
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
they
appear
to
reject
even
that
reasoning
of
the
second
circuit.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
right
and
that
seem
to
make
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
that
is
normally
you
need
a
warrant
--
you
want
a
warrant
because
you
want
to
interpose
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
between
the
police
and
initial
intrusion
on
the
privacy
of
the
individual.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct,
provided
they
were
still
in
jail
and
that
the
purpose
of
the
search
was
not
to
harass
them
or
in
anyway
to
break
the
law.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct
because
as
we
believe
the
term,
the
word
“incident”
as
it’s
particularly
applied
on
the
robinson
case
means
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
arrest
that
is
if
you
have
his
body
in
custody
and
in
jail
and
he
is
lawfully
incarcerated
and
his
privacy
has
been
interfered
with
to
that
extent.
we
think
you
do
not
need
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
to
decide
whether
you
can
search
or
take
an
article
or
clothing
from
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
if
he
is
still,
i,
if
that
carrying
that
reasoning
out
that
would
be
correct.
if
he
is
still
in
jail
and
if
they
are
acting
reasonably,
i
am
not
arguing
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
incidentally
because
by
virtue
of
his
arrest
and
custody
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
believe,
your
honor,
in
the
case
called
lanza
versus
untied
states
rejected
out
of
hand
a
notion
that
someone
in
jail
at
anytime
could
complain
about
being
searched
or
being
subject
of
an
unreasonable
searches.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
true.
it’s
factually
distinguishable
but
i
was
merely
talking
about
the
board
proposition
that
your
honor
is
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
i
understand
that,
what
i
am
saying
is
the
case
involved
simply
searching
someone
who
is
lawfully
in
jail
and
your
honor
rejected
out
of
hand
the
notion
that
someone
in
jail,
over
and
above
any
claim
of
by
virtue
of
an
arrest
could
even
assert
such
a
proposition.
now,
we
are
not
arguing
and
we
are
not
going
as
far
as
that
language
would
take
us.
we
are
not
saying
that
someone
in
jail
is
totally
at
the
mercy
of
the
jailers
with
regard
to
what
they
could
do
with
him.
they
could
not
strip
search
him,
they
could
not
harass
him
and
they
could
not
undertake
any
other
kind
of
search
unless
it
was
undertaken
in
good
faith
and
reasonably
motivated.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
if
you’re
looking
for
evidence
of
a
crime
or
a
contraband.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
right.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
we
would
not
argue
that
–
that’s
correct
because
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct
because
that’s
what
gives
rise
to
your
rights
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
or
whether
he
is
bailable
risk.
it’s
not
so
much
the
difference
of
course
if
he
has
the
bail
money
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
think
there
are
certain
circumstances
under
which
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
not
because
he
had
the
money
for
bail
but
because
he
was
already
free
and
to
search
him
again
would
involve
an
intrusion
on
to
his
privacy
which
would
not
be
incidental
to
anything.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
difference
is
that
in
one
instance
he
is
free
and
to
search
him
would
involve
an
intrusion
on
his
privacy.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
in
most
instances
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
but
reasonable,
when
i
say
reasonableness
i
don’t
mean
probable
cause,
i
mean
reasonable
in
the
sense
that
they’re
not
simply
strip
searching
them
every
hour
for
the
purpose
of
harassing
them.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
but
i
think
reasonable,
the
word
“reasonable”
has
a
different
definition
when
you
are
talking
about
stopping
someone
on
the
street
for
no
reason
and
searching
him
and
when
he
is
already
in
jail
and
in
custody
and
his
privacy
has
been
interfered
with,
to
that
extent.
it
doesn’t
seem
to
me
that
you
need
now
the
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
that
you
would
need
for
example
if
you
want
to
search
his
house.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
it
would
be
in
that
sense
but
also
the
fourth
amendment’s
reasonableness
that
the
word
“reasonable”
in
the
fourth
amendment
has
not
always
been
construed
to
require
a
showing
of
probable
cause
for
an
intrusion
on
the
privacy
of
an
individual.
for
example,
in
terry
versus
ohio.
the
defendant
was
stopped
and
frisked
and
now
it
was
not
said
that
you
needed
for
that
particular
interference
with
his
liberty
that
you
needed
probable
cause
and
what
constitutes
a
reasonable
search
even
under
the
fourth
amendment.
i
agree
that
they
may
overlap
and
really
what
i
am
probably
getting
to
is
the
fourth
amendment
reasonableness.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
fourthteenth.
i
am
sorry
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
right,
but
i
think
to
a
certain
extent
that
they
might
would
overlap
and
that
harassing
and
searching
hin
every
hour
for
example
for
the
purpose
of
harassing
would
probably
be
a
violation
of
both,
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment
because
that
would
simply
unreasonable
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
jailers.
on
the
other
hand,
in
this
case
for
example,
where
we
hardly,
could
hardly
be
said
even
under
the
fourth
amendment
if
probable
cause
is
the
standard
and
the
court
of
appeals
here
found
that
there
was
probable
cause
in
their
opinion.
they
said
that
we
find
that
there
was
probable
cause
and
i
said,
“that’s
still
not
enough.”
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct
because
there
was
no
warrant.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
think
it
would
depend,
as
i
said
it
would
be
the
kind
of
test
your
honor
is
suggesting
but
also
i
think
the
protections
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifth
amendments
overlap
to
a
certain
extent
with
the
fourth
amendment.
and
that
of
course
the
kind
of
conduct
that
was
involved
in
rochin
would
clearly
come
under
the
fourth
amendment
standard
but
for
example
the
cases,
your
honor
mentioned
in
terry
where
cases
which
involve
reasonableness
in
the
sense
that
there
was
a
legitimate
law
enforcement
purpose
combined
with
an
intrusion,
which
was
something,
less
than
a
full
scale
arrest
and
seizure
of
the
individual
and
that
it
seems
to
me
is
what
we
have
here.
here
he
was
already
in
custody.
he
was
in
jail
and
this
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
we
do
and
the
court
of
appeals
so
found.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
it’s
not
essential
that
the
court
decide
that
here
but
in
making
the
argument,
i
think
i
would
want
to
concede
that
even
if
there
was
something
less
than
probable
cause
here
that
the
search
would
be
improper.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct
and
your
honor,
i
said,
need
you
decide
it,
i
actually
should
have
respond
to
that.
i
think
you
already
have
in
the
robinson
case
where
there
was
no
reason
on
the
part
of
the
officer
to
believe
that
the
defendant
was
armed
or
that
there
would
be
any
evidence
of
carrying
it
and
yet
in
saying
that
we
do
not
care
what
the
officer
thought.
the
court
said
the
right
to
search
arises
from
the
fact
of
the
arrest
and
we
are
not
going
to
look
into
whether
the
officer
really
had
any
reason
to
believe
he
is
going
to
find
a
gun
in
the
cigarette
pack.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no
because
we’re
not
simply
--
i
would
like
to
get
away
from
the
phrase
incident
to.
the
reason
that
we
say
you
don’t
need
a
warrant
if
he’s
in
jail
is
because
his
freedom
has
already
been
restrained
and
he
is
in
custody
and
to
go
and
look
in
his
pockets
or
take
his
shirt
does
not
involve
really
the
substantial
additional
intrusion.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
is
out
on
bail
and
he
is
out
free
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes
but
the
seizure
now
involves
something
more.
he
is
free
and
it
involves
picking
him
up
but
it
involves
saying,
“take
off
your
clothes.”
it
is
a
substantial
additional
intrusion
onto
his
privacy
which
is
not
so
if
he
is
already
locked
up
in
jail.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
that
is
a
catch
phrase
and
i
am
reminded
of
mr.
justice
holmes’
statement
that
it
is
one
of
the
misfortunes
of
the
law
that
ideas
become
insisted
in
phrases
and
there
after
for
a
long
time
seize
to
provoke
further
thought.
now,
the
notions
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
am
trying.
i
think
that
the
phrase
incident
to
an
arrest
embodies
certain
value
judgments.
that
is,
you
can
search
someone
after
he
is
arrested
because
you
already
have
him
in
custody
or
you
have
a
valid
basis
for
his
arrest
and
you
do
not
have
to
go
to
a
neutral
magistrate
to
go
that
one
step
further.
on
the
other
hand,
we
would
say
if
he
is
out
free
and
he
is
walking
on
the
streets
and
he
has
been
released
on
bail.
then
stopping
him
all
over
again,
taking
him
and
detaining
him
for
however
short
a
period
of
time
and
taking
his
clothing
that
does
involve
a
significant
additional
intrusion
on
his
privacy.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
even
though
he
had
been
validly
arrested
because
it
is
a
different
kind
of
intrusion
onto
his
privacy.
here
he
is
now
free,
he
is
free
to
do
what
he
chooses
as
long
as
he
reports
to
court
when
ordered
and
to
stop
and
to
place
him
under
temporary
detention
simply
involves
a
kind
of
an
additional
intrusion
which
is
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct
because
the
search
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct
and
his
freedom
has
been
interfered
within
that
way
i
think
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
hopefully
in
these
times
it
would
not
last
that
long
but
i
would
say
if
you
carried
my
argument
out
to
its
most
probably
logical
extreme,
that’s
where
it
would
lead
you,
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
i
would.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
which
fifth
amendment
rights
are
you,
which
ones?
mr.
edward
r.
korman
now
which
fifth
amendments
rights?
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
i
wouldn’t.
i
wouldn’t
say
that
only
because
it
reflects
totally
different
values
than
fourth
amendment
right
of
privacy
that
is
if
he
is
already
in
jail
--
the
purpose
of
having
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
is
to
protect,
is
to
interpose
a
magistrate
between
the
police
and
some
substantial
interference
with
the
privacy
interest
of
the
individual,
and
if
he
is
already
in
jail
and
his
privacy
interest
have
been
interfered
in
that
way,
we
would
take
the
position
that
going
and
looking
into
his
pockets
only
involved
in
a
minimal
additional
intrusion
which
should
not
involve
a
--
which
should
not
need
a
magistrate
to
authorize.
on
the
other
hand,
it
says
here
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
pardon
me?
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
the
court
is
held
for
example
that
you
can
stop
someone
briefly
on
the
street
and
search
him
without
a
warrant
in
less
than
a
probable
cause
in
terry.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
it
depends
on
what
the
frisk
reveals.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
would
--
i
would
--
i
could
not
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
not
yet,
i
could
not
answer
that
categorically.
if
he
felt
a
hard
object
for
example
he
probably
could
stick
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
[laughter
attempt]
no,
no,
i
meant
not
yet
in
the
sense
that
it
was
premature
for
the
police
to
reach
into
his
pockets
immediately.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
i'm
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
think
to
a
certain
extent
that
when
you
are
in
jail,
your
freedom
of
association
is
interfered
with
and
to
that
extent
you
don’t
have
the
same
rights
as
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
i
think
the
test
is
reasonable
must
there.
the
regulations
which
restrict
your
right
of
free
speech
in
jail
have
to
be
based
on
some
reasonable
justification
by
the
jailers.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
necessarily
so,
i
think.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
that’s
correct,
perhaps
i
went
off
in
trying
to
give
a
policy
of
justification,
for
that
holding
which
is
a
simply
statement
of
fact
and
the
policy
justification
for
i
think
was
stated
in
mr.
justice
powell’s
concurring
opinion
in
robinson
and
that’s
essentially
what
i
am
urging
here.
that
once
he
is
lawfully
in
custody,
it
doesn’t
involve
any
additional
substantial
intrusion
on
his
privacy
to
then
search
him
without
a
warrant
as
long
as
the
police
act
reasonably.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
to
the
sixth
circuit.
that
court
refers
judgments
of
conviction
entered
by
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
ohio
convicting
eugene
h.
edwards
and
the
late
william
t.
livesay
who
died
subsequent
to
the
granting
of
the
writ
of
attempting
to
break
into
the
united
states
post
office
in
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
section
2115.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
certain
scientific
evidence
which
established
that
paint
chips
which
were
found
on
the
clothing
of
both
of
these
gentlemen
came
from
the
same
source
as
paint
chips
on
the
window
of
the
post
office
where
the
attempted
burglary
had
taken
place,
and
that
this
evidence
was
the
fruit
of
the
unlawful
taking
of
the
clothing
of
these
two
gentlemen
some
10
hours
after
their
arrest
on
the
morning
following
their
arrest.
although
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
arrest
of
mr.
edwards
was
lawful,
did
not
in
fact
reach
the
issue
as
to
mr.
livesay
and
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
take
the
clothing.
it
held
that
the
taking
was
fatally
defective
because
a
warrant
had
not
been
obtained
for
the
search
and
seizure
of
the
clothing.
the
issue
presented
here
as
to
whether
the
authority
to
search
an
individual
without
a
warrant
or
an
independent
showing
of
probable
cause
which
arises
by
virtue
of
his
lawful
arrest
is
somehow
dissipated,
if
it
is
not
exercised
“substantially
contemporaneously
with
the
arrest,”
but
several
hours,
in
this
case
approximately
nine,
after
the
administrative
process
and
other
mechanics
of
the
arrest
have
come
to
a
halt.
since
there
is
in
this
case
a
lingering
issue
as
to
the
validity
of
the
underlying
arrest
raised
by
implication
in
the
brief
that’s
been
filed
by
the
respondent
and
expressly
by
mr.
edwards
in
a
separate
document
which
he
has
filed
with
this
court
entitled
the
motion
for
extension
of
time
for
filing
a
writ
of
certiorari.
it
is
appropriate,
i
think
to
begin
the
discussion
of
the
facts
in
this
case
where
it
all
began
on
the
evening
of
may
31st
in
the
year
1971,
in
the
city
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well
presumably,
it
has
been
raised
as
an
alternative
grounds
for
affirmance,
although
it
was
not
raised
as
an
issue
on
our
petition
for
certiorari
that
was
raised,
as
i
understand
it
in
the
opposing
papers
on
certiorari.
but
nevertheless,
i
think
it
would
still
be
helpful
to
start
this
case
where
it
began
in
lebanon,
ohio
around
10:45
in
the
evening
on
may
31,
1970.
at
this
point,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
a
map
which
is
on
page
1
of
a
supplemental
appendix
which
we
filed
yesterday
and
which
might
be
helpful
at
the
court
had
while
i
discuss
the
facts,
in
the
event
that
it
had
not
yet
been
distributed.
i
gave
nine
copies
to
the
clerk
right
now
and
you
might
be
able
to
distribute
it.
i
said
yesterday,
we
filed
a
supplemental
appendix
which
contained
a
map
of
the
area.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes.
the
map
is
the
map
of
approximately
two
or
three
square
blocks
and
around
10:45
in
the
evening
at
10th
plymouth
pulled
up
at
south
sycamore
street
which
is
a
block
from
the
lebanon
post
office
and
parked
at
number
124
south
sycamore
street.
three
gentlemen
emerged,
took
something
out
of
the
trunk
of
the
vehicle
and
began
walking
towards
the
business
district.
this
scene
was
viewed
by
several
people
who
were
sitting
on
the
porch
or
looking
out
of
their
windows.
one
of
them
called
the
police
and
told
them
that
three
strange
persons
had
been
seen
emerging
from
this
stand,
plymouth.
this
is
generally
a
business
district
except
for
this
brief,
small
residential
area
and
a
bulletin
went
out
that
three
suspicious
persons
had
been
observed
leaving
this
town
on
an
automobile.
at
that
point
and
time,
patrolman
ashley
was
cruising
on
south
street
which
is
right
around
the
corner
towards
the
bottom
of
the
map.
he
proceeded
to
examine
the
plymouth,
saw
nothing
particularly
unusual
about
it
except
that
it
had
an
out-of-county
license
plate.
he
then
drove
around
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
out-of-county
license
plates,
apparently
in
ohio,
each
county,
--
the
residents
of
each
county
get
license
plates
with
a
particular
letter
on
the
license
number
to
indicate
the
county
in
which
the
automobile
is
registered.
seeing
nothing
particularly
unusual
other
than
this,
patrolman
ashley
drove
his
car
around
up
south
sycamore
street
north,
he
made
then
a
right
turn
onto
west
main
street,
and
then
you
see
the
alley
on
west
main
street.
he
drove
down
the
alley,
into
the
driveway
of
the
lebanon
post
office.
he
then
drove
through
the
driveway
and
now
to
south
broadway.
as
he
got
to
the
past
the
post
office
he
turned
north
and
he
saw
two
individuals
on
the
north
boundary
of
the
lebanon
post
office
near
the
museum.
it
appeared
to
him
that
they
were
walking
in
a
north,
northeasterly
direction
that
they
had
just
come
from
that
portion
of
the
post
office
and
being
perhaps
naturally
suspicious
since
this
was
10:30
at
night
in
the
business
district,
which
was
not
on
a
sunday
night,
which
was
not
to
his
knowledge
terribly
crowded
with
people.
he
decided
to
follow
them
and
so
as
they
walked,
he
drove
behind
them,
and
they
made
a
turn
on
west
main
street
to
begin
walking
towards
south
sycamore.
and
by
the
time,
agent
ashley
had
gone
to
west
main
street
over
the
radio
of
his
car
he
heard
that
the
burglar
alarm
had
been
sounded
at
the
post
office.
he
there
upon
stopped
these
two
gentlemen,
asked
them
to
get
into
his
car
which
they
did
without
drawing
the
revolver
and
then
he
drove
back
to
the
post
office,
got
out
of
the
car,
by
that
time
other
police
officers
had
arrived
on
the
scene.
he
examined
the
bank
and
the
area
right
where
he
had
seen
these
gentlemen
emerged
from
and
discovered
that
in
fact
there
had
been
an
attempted
burglary.
there
were
burglar’s
tools,
the
screen
had
apparently
been
tampered
with
and
also
he
noticed
paint
chips
near
the
area
as
well,
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
he
told
these
gentlemen
that
they
were
under
arrest
and
they
were
taken
into
custody.
now
these
two
gentlemen
were
mr.
edwards,
who
was
a
respondent
here
and
one
huntley,
who
was
not
convicted
of
this
crime
because
he
jumped
bail
and
ultimately
plead
guilty
to
bail
jumping
rather
than
the
particular
offense
here.
at
the
time
all
of
this
was
transpiring,
the
defendant
livesay
was
observed
back
on
118
sycamore
street
hopping
over
the
back
fence
and
hiding
in
the
bushes
at
118
south
sycamore
street.
he
had
been
observed
by
a
mr.
cruise
who
lived
in
the
house
and
who
had
earlier
was
one
of
the
neighbors
who
had
observed
this
three
gentlemen
emerged
from
the
plymouth.
he
then
saw
mr.
livesay
run
towards
the
plymouth
and
hide
in
the
plymouth
where
mr.
livesay
was
ultimately
discovered
by
another
patrolman
who
placed
him
under
arrest
and
brought
him
to
the
scene
of
the
crime.
after
these
gentlemen
were
placed
in
custody,
this
is
now
and
taken
into
the
station
house,
this
is
approximately
now
about
11:30
on
a
sunday
night.
they
were
placed
in
custody
and
the
following
morning,
the
police
having
noticed
the
paint
chips
near
the
window
with
police
--
went
to
a
local
department
store
called
kaufman’s
department
store
and
purchased
new
clothing
for
these
gentlemen,
went
to
the
prison
sometime
around
9:30
of
the
local
jail,
asked
the
two
men
to
change
into
the
clothing,
which
had
been
purchased.
the
clothing
that
they
were
wearing
had
been
taken
from
them
and
that
of
course
the
scientific
analysis
which
followed
clearly
established
that
the
paint
chips
that
were
found
on
their
clothing
came
from
the
same
source
as
the
paint
chips
from
the
window
of
the
post
office.
and
prior
the
trial,
a
motion
to
suppress
was
made
and
i
note
only
for
the
purposes
of
information
amounting
to
suppress
only
dealt
with
the
probable
cause
aspect
and
did
not
involve
the
issue
that
was
ultimately
raised
and
decided
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals.
at
trial
the
evidence
was
as
i
described
it,
the
observations
of
the
patrolmen,
the
neighbors
in
the
surrounding
area,
and
of
course
the
testimony
of
two
scientific
--
two
people
who
made
the
scientific
analysis.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
we
received
the
copy
of
the
document
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
petition
or
application
for
an
extension
of
time
to
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
several
weeks
ago,
i
have
my
copy
here,
it
was
handwritten.
we
received
a
copy,
i
looked
through
the
court’s
file
yesterday
in
the
docket
room
and
i
did
not
notice
it
among
the
papers
there.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
now
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
rather
exhaustive
opinion
rejected
the
argument
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
held
that
the
police
officers
acted.
it’s
a
reasonable
proof
and
then
should
have
under
the
circumstances.
however,
it
held
that
the
seizure
of
the
clothing,
some
ten
hours
after
the
arrest
was
invalid.
the
court
reasoned
that
since
the
arrest
was
not
contemporaneous
--
the
search
was
not
contemporaneous
with
the
arrest.
it
could
not
be
justified
as
a
“search
incident
to
an
arrest.”
and
struck
down
the
taking
of
the
clothing
because
there
was
no
warrant
even
though
as
i
indicated
earlier
found
probable
cause
to
justify
the
actual
taking
of
the
pants
independent
of
the
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
we
have
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
not
only
because
of
the
conflict
among
the
circuits
but
the
importance
of
the
issue
in
both
federal
and
state
prosecutions
and
indeed
we
have
been
advised
by
the
attorney
general
of
ohio
that
a
predictable
spate
of
habeas
corpus
litigation
has
already
begun
that
in
the
southern
district
of
ohio
alone,
two
habeas
corpus
petitions
have
already
been
granted
in
the
dean
versus
gray
and
carpenter
versus
gray
and
are
pending
before
the
sixth
circuit
and
there
is
yet
another
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
a
case
called
huskinson
versus
grey
raising
the
same
issue
as
involved
in
this
case
and
the
sixth
circuit.
principle
error
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
that
question
was
put
to
the
police
officer
who
was
in
charge
and
he
started
to
answer
what
they
do
generally
and
then
he
stopped
himself
and
he
said,
“do
you
mean
generally
or
what
did
we
do
in
this
case?”
whereupon
they
said
was,
“well,
what
did
you
do
in
this
case?”
and
he
said
that
they
took
it
the
morning
after
apparently
with
the
expressed
purpose
in
mind
not
of
holding
it
for
inventory
or
exchanging
it
for
a
jail
clothing.
apparently,
they
had
no
jail
clothing
since
they
had
to
go
out
and
purchase
this
clothing
and
so
that
it
was
taken
with
the
expressed
purpose
of
conducting
the
analysis
that
was
ultimately
conducted.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
think
i
believe
that
we
would
although
there
is
a
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
called
brett
versus
the
united
states
in
which
that
had
been
done
and
the
clothing
was
i
believe,
deposited
and
held
for
about
three
days
afterwards.
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
you
cannot
take
the
clothing
three
days
afterward
even
though
it
had
already
been
taken
from
the
defendants
without
warrant.
it’s
our
view
as
i
shall
elaborate
that
it
is
the,
as
the
court
observed
in
the
robinson
case
it
is
the
fact
of
the
arrest
which
gives
rise
to
the
right
to
seize
and
take
clothing
and
under
those
circumstances.
it
doesn’t
matter
and
there
is
no
reasonable
basis
to
draw
a
distinction
between
takings
which
occurred
five
minutes
after
the
arrest
or
five
hours
after
the
arrest.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
and
no
attempt
was
made
to
do
that
below.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
it’s
not.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct
and
there
was
no
apparently,
the
only
evidence
that
can
be
drawn
from
the
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
right
and
there
was
no
other
clothing
in
the
prison,
so
apparently
they
went
out
and
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
exactly
and
part
of
it
--
and
by
the
way,
part
of
the
reason
for
the
delay
of
ten
hours
could
have
been
reduced
to
about
two
hours
was
that
they
decided
to
wait
until
morning
to
buy
them
a
new
pair
of
clothing
before
they
actually
made
them
undress
in
the
prison
and
give
up
the
clothing
that
they’re
wearing.
so
that
this
is
a
clear
case
on
which
police
officers
acted
reasonably
under
any
definition
of
the
term
and
the
conclusion
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
they
acted
unreasonably
is
really
based
we
believe
on
a
mistaken
reliance
on
cases
involving
search
incident
to
an
arrest
which
involves
searches
of
homes
and
other
similar
areas
where
a
defendant
happened
to
be
arrested
in
his
house
and
under
those
circumstances
it
was
held
that
an
arrest,
which
was,
when
you
arrest
someone
in
his
house
you
can’t
go
search
the
whole
house
because
of
the
fortuitous
circumstance
that
you
happen
to
have
arrested
him
there
and
of
course
in
some
instances,
the
circumstance
was
not
just
fortuitous
but
the
police
knowing
that
they’d
be
able
to
search
a
whole
house
if
they
happened
to
find
the
defendant
there
to
arrest
him
with
the
plan
to
arrest
accordingly.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
oh,
i
think
it
would
be
different
and
should
be
different
but
i
am
not
sure
that
the
sixth
circuit
would
think
so.
they
expressly
reject
it
for
example
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
in
which
something
precisely
like
that
had
been
done
and
six
hours
after
the
clothing
had
actually
been
taken
from
the
defendants,
the
fbi
picked
up
the
clothing
to
conduct
scientific
samples.
and
the
second
circuit
said,
“that’s
perfectly
all
right”
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
they
appear
to
reject
even
that
reasoning
of
the
second
circuit.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
right
and
that
seem
to
make
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
that
is
normally
you
need
a
warrant
--
you
want
a
warrant
because
you
want
to
interpose
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
between
the
police
and
initial
intrusion
on
the
privacy
of
the
individual.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct,
provided
they
were
still
in
jail
and
that
the
purpose
of
the
search
was
not
to
harass
them
or
in
anyway
to
break
the
law.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct
because
as
we
believe
the
term,
the
word
“incident”
as
it’s
particularly
applied
on
the
robinson
case
means
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
arrest
that
is
if
you
have
his
body
in
custody
and
in
jail
and
he
is
lawfully
incarcerated
and
his
privacy
has
been
interfered
with
to
that
extent.
we
think
you
do
not
need
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
to
decide
whether
you
can
search
or
take
an
article
or
clothing
from
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
if
he
is
still,
i,
if
that
carrying
that
reasoning
out
that
would
be
correct.
if
he
is
still
in
jail
and
if
they
are
acting
reasonably,
i
am
not
arguing
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
incidentally
because
by
virtue
of
his
arrest
and
custody
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
believe,
your
honor,
in
the
case
called
lanza
versus
untied
states
rejected
out
of
hand
a
notion
that
someone
in
jail
at
anytime
could
complain
about
being
searched
or
being
subject
of
an
unreasonable
searches.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
true.
it’s
factually
distinguishable
but
i
was
merely
talking
about
the
board
proposition
that
your
honor
is
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
i
understand
that,
what
i
am
saying
is
the
case
involved
simply
searching
someone
who
is
lawfully
in
jail
and
your
honor
rejected
out
of
hand
the
notion
that
someone
in
jail,
over
and
above
any
claim
of
by
virtue
of
an
arrest
could
even
assert
such
a
proposition.
now,
we
are
not
arguing
and
we
are
not
going
as
far
as
that
language
would
take
us.
we
are
not
saying
that
someone
in
jail
is
totally
at
the
mercy
of
the
jailers
with
regard
to
what
they
could
do
with
him.
they
could
not
strip
search
him,
they
could
not
harass
him
and
they
could
not
undertake
any
other
kind
of
search
unless
it
was
undertaken
in
good
faith
and
reasonably
motivated.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
if
you’re
looking
for
evidence
of
a
crime
or
a
contraband.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
right.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
we
would
not
argue
that
–
that’s
correct
because
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct
because
that’s
what
gives
rise
to
your
rights
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
or
whether
he
is
bailable
risk.
it’s
not
so
much
the
difference
of
course
if
he
has
the
bail
money
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
think
there
are
certain
circumstances
under
which
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
not
because
he
had
the
money
for
bail
but
because
he
was
already
free
and
to
search
him
again
would
involve
an
intrusion
on
to
his
privacy
which
would
not
be
incidental
to
anything.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
difference
is
that
in
one
instance
he
is
free
and
to
search
him
would
involve
an
intrusion
on
his
privacy.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
in
most
instances
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
but
reasonable,
when
i
say
reasonableness
i
don’t
mean
probable
cause,
i
mean
reasonable
in
the
sense
that
they’re
not
simply
strip
searching
them
every
hour
for
the
purpose
of
harassing
them.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
but
i
think
reasonable,
the
word
“reasonable”
has
a
different
definition
when
you
are
talking
about
stopping
someone
on
the
street
for
no
reason
and
searching
him
and
when
he
is
already
in
jail
and
in
custody
and
his
privacy
has
been
interfered
with,
to
that
extent.
it
doesn’t
seem
to
me
that
you
need
now
the
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
that
you
would
need
for
example
if
you
want
to
search
his
house.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
it
would
be
in
that
sense
but
also
the
fourth
amendment’s
reasonableness
that
the
word
“reasonable”
in
the
fourth
amendment
has
not
always
been
construed
to
require
a
showing
of
probable
cause
for
an
intrusion
on
the
privacy
of
an
individual.
for
example,
in
terry
versus
ohio.
the
defendant
was
stopped
and
frisked
and
now
it
was
not
said
that
you
needed
for
that
particular
interference
with
his
liberty
that
you
needed
probable
cause
and
what
constitutes
a
reasonable
search
even
under
the
fourth
amendment.
i
agree
that
they
may
overlap
and
really
what
i
am
probably
getting
to
is
the
fourth
amendment
reasonableness.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
fourthteenth.
i
am
sorry
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
right,
but
i
think
to
a
certain
extent
that
they
might
would
overlap
and
that
harassing
and
searching
hin
every
hour
for
example
for
the
purpose
of
harassing
would
probably
be
a
violation
of
both,
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendment
because
that
would
simply
unreasonable
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
jailers.
on
the
other
hand,
in
this
case
for
example,
where
we
hardly,
could
hardly
be
said
even
under
the
fourth
amendment
if
probable
cause
is
the
standard
and
the
court
of
appeals
here
found
that
there
was
probable
cause
in
their
opinion.
they
said
that
we
find
that
there
was
probable
cause
and
i
said,
“that’s
still
not
enough.”
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct
because
there
was
no
warrant.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
think
it
would
depend,
as
i
said
it
would
be
the
kind
of
test
your
honor
is
suggesting
but
also
i
think
the
protections
of
the
fourteenth
and
fifth
amendments
overlap
to
a
certain
extent
with
the
fourth
amendment.
and
that
of
course
the
kind
of
conduct
that
was
involved
in
rochin
would
clearly
come
under
the
fourth
amendment
standard
but
for
example
the
cases,
your
honor
mentioned
in
terry
where
cases
which
involve
reasonableness
in
the
sense
that
there
was
a
legitimate
law
enforcement
purpose
combined
with
an
intrusion,
which
was
something,
less
than
a
full
scale
arrest
and
seizure
of
the
individual
and
that
it
seems
to
me
is
what
we
have
here.
here
he
was
already
in
custody.
he
was
in
jail
and
this
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
we
do
and
the
court
of
appeals
so
found.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
it’s
not
essential
that
the
court
decide
that
here
but
in
making
the
argument,
i
think
i
would
want
to
concede
that
even
if
there
was
something
less
than
probable
cause
here
that
the
search
would
be
improper.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct
and
your
honor,
i
said,
need
you
decide
it,
i
actually
should
have
respond
to
that.
i
think
you
already
have
in
the
robinson
case
where
there
was
no
reason
on
the
part
of
the
officer
to
believe
that
the
defendant
was
armed
or
that
there
would
be
any
evidence
of
carrying
it
and
yet
in
saying
that
we
do
not
care
what
the
officer
thought.
the
court
said
the
right
to
search
arises
from
the
fact
of
the
arrest
and
we
are
not
going
to
look
into
whether
the
officer
really
had
any
reason
to
believe
he
is
going
to
find
a
gun
in
the
cigarette
pack.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no
because
we’re
not
simply
--
i
would
like
to
get
away
from
the
phrase
incident
to.
the
reason
that
we
say
you
don’t
need
a
warrant
if
he’s
in
jail
is
because
his
freedom
has
already
been
restrained
and
he
is
in
custody
and
to
go
and
look
in
his
pockets
or
take
his
shirt
does
not
involve
really
the
substantial
additional
intrusion.
on
the
other
hand,
if
he
is
out
on
bail
and
he
is
out
free
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes
but
the
seizure
now
involves
something
more.
he
is
free
and
it
involves
picking
him
up
but
it
involves
saying,
“take
off
your
clothes.”
it
is
a
substantial
additional
intrusion
onto
his
privacy
which
is
not
so
if
he
is
already
locked
up
in
jail.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
that
is
a
catch
phrase
and
i
am
reminded
of
mr.
justice
holmes’
statement
that
it
is
one
of
the
misfortunes
of
the
law
that
ideas
become
insisted
in
phrases
and
there
after
for
a
long
time
seize
to
provoke
further
thought.
now,
the
notions
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
am
trying.
i
think
that
the
phrase
incident
to
an
arrest
embodies
certain
value
judgments.
that
is,
you
can
search
someone
after
he
is
arrested
because
you
already
have
him
in
custody
or
you
have
a
valid
basis
for
his
arrest
and
you
do
not
have
to
go
to
a
neutral
magistrate
to
go
that
one
step
further.
on
the
other
hand,
we
would
say
if
he
is
out
free
and
he
is
walking
on
the
streets
and
he
has
been
released
on
bail.
then
stopping
him
all
over
again,
taking
him
and
detaining
him
for
however
short
a
period
of
time
and
taking
his
clothing
that
does
involve
a
significant
additional
intrusion
on
his
privacy.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
even
though
he
had
been
validly
arrested
because
it
is
a
different
kind
of
intrusion
onto
his
privacy.
here
he
is
now
free,
he
is
free
to
do
what
he
chooses
as
long
as
he
reports
to
court
when
ordered
and
to
stop
and
to
place
him
under
temporary
detention
simply
involves
a
kind
of
an
additional
intrusion
which
is
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct
because
the
search
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct
and
his
freedom
has
been
interfered
within
that
way
i
think
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
hopefully
in
these
times
it
would
not
last
that
long
but
i
would
say
if
you
carried
my
argument
out
to
its
most
probably
logical
extreme,
that’s
where
it
would
lead
you,
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
i
would.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
which
fifth
amendment
rights
are
you,
which
ones?
mr.
edward
r.
korman
now
which
fifth
amendments
rights?
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
i
wouldn’t.
i
wouldn’t
say
that
only
because
it
reflects
totally
different
values
than
fourth
amendment
right
of
privacy
that
is
if
he
is
already
in
jail
--
the
purpose
of
having
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
is
to
protect,
is
to
interpose
a
magistrate
between
the
police
and
some
substantial
interference
with
the
privacy
interest
of
the
individual,
and
if
he
is
already
in
jail
and
his
privacy
interest
have
been
interfered
in
that
way,
we
would
take
the
position
that
going
and
looking
into
his
pockets
only
involved
in
a
minimal
additional
intrusion
which
should
not
involve
a
--
which
should
not
need
a
magistrate
to
authorize.
on
the
other
hand,
it
says
here
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
pardon
me?
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
the
court
is
held
for
example
that
you
can
stop
someone
briefly
on
the
street
and
search
him
without
a
warrant
in
less
than
a
probable
cause
in
terry.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
it
depends
on
what
the
frisk
reveals.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
would
--
i
would
--
i
could
not
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
not
yet,
i
could
not
answer
that
categorically.
if
he
felt
a
hard
object
for
example
he
probably
could
stick
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
[laughter
attempt]
no,
no,
i
meant
not
yet
in
the
sense
that
it
was
premature
for
the
police
to
reach
into
his
pockets
immediately.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
i'm
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
think
to
a
certain
extent
that
when
you
are
in
jail,
your
freedom
of
association
is
interfered
with
and
to
that
extent
you
don’t
have
the
same
rights
as
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
i
think
the
test
is
reasonable
must
there.
the
regulations
which
restrict
your
right
of
free
speech
in
jail
have
to
be
based
on
some
reasonable
justification
by
the
jailers.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
necessarily
so,
i
think.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct.
that’s
correct,
perhaps
i
went
off
in
trying
to
give
a
policy
of
justification,
for
that
holding
which
is
a
simply
statement
of
fact
and
the
policy
justification
for
i
think
was
stated
in
mr.
justice
powell’s
concurring
opinion
in
robinson
and
that’s
essentially
what
i
am
urging
here.
that
once
he
is
lawfully
in
custody,
it
doesn’t
involve
any
additional
substantial
intrusion
on
his
privacy
to
then
search
him
without
a
warrant
as
long
as
the
police
act
reasonably.
