unknown
speaker
these
are
the
areas?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
you
gave
respondent
one
too?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
would
make
a
difference
mr.
korman?
would
you
have
a
different
case
if
routinely
they
made
anyone
who
was
jailed
change
into
regular
prison
garment?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
if
i
understand
your
answer
correctly,
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
if
the
clothes
have
been
taking
away
from
them
three
weeks
after
their
arrest?
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
say
that,
that
that
was
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
ground?
unknown
speaker
so
you
could
have
done
it
two
years
after
his
arrest,
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
be
still
be
incident
to
his
arrest?
unknown
speaker
no,
no
that
was
so
much
chronic
over
hearing
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
and
there
was
no
--
that
case
did
not
involve
the
claim
at
all
of
a
search
incident
to
arrest.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
say
that
you
wouldn’t
so
far
seek
search
them
in
terms
of
probable
cause
to
search?
let’s
say
arrest
for
continued
custody
or
against
to
have
a
right
to
search
whether
you
have
probable
cause
to
search
the
proving
or
not.
unknown
speaker
but
the
man
was
out
on
bail?
if
you’re
looking
for
evidence
of
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don’t
have
to
that
probable
--
unknown
speaker
assume
as
you
had
probable
cause
to
believe
and
then
committed
the
crime
to
arrest.
unknown
speaker
mr.
korman,
would
you
say
that
the
search
conducted
in
the
jail
of
these
people’s
clothes
has
to
have
a
separate
justification
by
way
of
reasonableness
even
though
it’s
not
subject
to
the
warrant
requirement?
unknown
speaker
well,
reasonable
under
the
sense
of
the
fourth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
i
understood
your
answer.
it’s
not
reasonable
in
the,
i
mean
your
use
of
the
word
“reasonable”
is
not
in
the
fourth
amendment
sense
but
it
is
in
the
fourteenth,
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
sense
like
rochin
against
california.
unknown
speaker
well,
fourteenth
--
unknown
speaker
because
you
were
talking
about
harassment?
and
that’s
--
unknown
speaker
but
no
warrant.
unknown
speaker
it
is
probable
cause
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
so
it
seems
to
be
(inaudible)
the
case
that
where
there
is
not
any
probable
cause
but
you
can
nevertheless
searched
in
jail?
unknown
speaker
when
he
searched
him,
you
had
probable
cause
and
i
take
it
for
the
arrest.
unknown
speaker
and
mainly
that
you
have
been
–
that
he
had
committed
this
crime.
unknown
speaker
and
at
the
time
you
searched
him,
you
knew
that
he
had
been
crawled
through
a
window.
unknown
speaker
but
nevertheless,
this
would
be
a
fortiori
case
with
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
the
whole
thrust
of
your
argument
in
your
brief
at
least
and
i
think
now
is
that
this
search
was
valid
because
it
was
a
search
incident
to
a
valid
arrest.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that’s
correct,
i
don’t
quite
understand
your
answer
to
my
brother
marshall’s
question
a
while
ago
that
why
wouldn’t
search
be
equally
valid
if
may
have
this
man
after
he’d
been
released
on
bail.
he
still
had
been
arrested,
wouldn’t
it
equally
be
a
search
incident
to
a
valid
arrest?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
had
been
arrested.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
then
maybe
i
don’t
understand
your
argument.
i
thought
that
as
i
said,
your
argument
was
this
was
incident
to
a
valid
arrest,
isn’t
it
that’s
why
you
try
--
you
justify
its
validity?
unknown
speaker
we
can
now
be
prisoners
of
words
but
i
just
want
to
get
your
thoughts
and
what
you
are
implicating.
unknown
speaker
even
though
he
had
been
validly
arrested?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
then
your
argument
is
rather
and
you
tell
me
if
i
am
wrong,
i
am
trying
to
understand
it,
is
that
he
is
validly
in
prison,
in
custody
and
for
that
reason
he
can
be
searched,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
not
that
he
was
not
--
but
it’s
not
incidental
arrest,
it’s
because
he
is
validly
locked
up.
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
the
arrest
is
good,
so
long
as
he
is
validly
locked
up,
the
search
is
valid
in
your
submission
even
if
it’s
five
years
after
his
initial
locking
up.
right?
unknown
speaker
i
should
relate
--
unknown
speaker
excuse
me
mr.
chief
justice.
i
was
inquiring
whether
you
are
addressing
in
this
case
what
in
effect
is
the
first
search.
it
seems
to
me
there
may
be
a
difference
between
what
sometimes
is
called
an
inventory
search.
the
person
is
lawfully
arrested,
imprisoned
and
usually
as
i
understand
it
he
is
then
searched
usually
forthwith
here
for
reasons
that
have
been
indicated,
he
was
not
searched
until
the
next
morning
and
substitute
clothes
could
be
made
available.
once
an
inventory
search
had
been
completed
and
prison
clothes
had
been
provided,
there
would
be
no
further
occasion
for
that
type
of
search
as
i
understand
it
unless
there
was
some
reason
to
believe
he
had
been
a
recipient
of
a
weapon
secreted
into
the
jail
or
drugs
or
the
like.
unknown
speaker
do
you
draw
that
distinction?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you’d
say
a
man
who
is
in
jail
loses
his
fifth
amendment
rights
also?
unknown
speaker
a
man
in
jail.
unknown
speaker
self-incrimination.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
true
on
the
street
then
too.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
true
on
the
street
then
because
it’s
only
minimal.
unknown
speaker
empty
his
pockets?
unknown
speaker
i
say
empty
his
pockets?
unknown
speaker
not
yet.
unknown
speaker
you
said
not
yet
rather
hopefully.
unknown
speaker
and
looking
thoroughly
what
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
are
that
involve
his
rights
to
privacy?
unknown
speaker
same
as
others?
unknown
speaker
well,
all
these
rights
become
modified
once
a
person
becomes
--
unknown
speaker
it’s
stated
in
the
petition
for
a
certiorari
that
the
question
presented
is
whether
what
happened
here
was
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
when
there
was
--
it
states
that
there
was
a
lawful
arrest
after
he
has
been
unlawfully
arrested.
i
don’t
have
before
me
here
your
response
to
that
petition
and
maybe
you
did
not
make
one.
but
that
is
the
question,
i
wonder
if
it
is
open
to
you
to
make
the
argument
that
the
arrest
was
unlawful.
unknown
speaker
or
whether
you
accepted
the
question
as
framed
by
the
government.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don’t
probably
argue
it.
unknown
speaker
what’s
this
other
paper
that
mr.
smith
that
you
describe
in
the
courts
that
--
i
don't
know
understand.
unknown
speaker
you
haven’t
seen
it
either?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
this
is
on
file
list.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
the
likely
able
search
where
he
abandoned
--go
arrest
and
search
in
his
own
room,
in
the
hotel
and
he
had
thrown
stuff
in
the
waste
paper
basket,
the
court
held
that
that
was
abandoned?
so
he
no
longer
could
complain
of
its
seizure
and
its
use.
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
a
sort
of
situation
that
chief
justice
suggests?
unknown
speaker
in
this
connection
let
me
ask
the
question
with
you
which
i
asked
mr.
korman.
suppose
routinely,
that
this
jail,
they
issued
prison
guard,
would
you
have
a
different
case?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
were,
instead
of
being
in
a
jail,
just
after
arrest,
if
he
were
a
convict
in
the
state
penitentiary,
would
a
search
warrant
be
necessary
for
the
compulsory
exchange
of
clothing
and
the
examination
of
his
pockets
there?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it.
the
point
of
distinction
you
are
drawing
if
i
understood
you
correctly
was
this
was
taken
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
search.
unknown
speaker
and
if
that
is
so
then
why
isn’t
the
answer
to
my
penitentiary
inmates
situation
exactly
the
same?
unknown
speaker
because
they
take
the
objects
in
the
clothes
and
i
suppose
package
them
and
suppose
entirely
returned.
unknown
speaker
it’s
the
idea
of
an
inventory
search.
unknown
speaker
the
trouble
with
your
posture
here,
suppose
the
warden
of
the
state
penitentiary
is
aware
that
there
are
narcotics
in
the
prison
and
so
he
asks
every
inmate
to
change
clothing.
as
i
understand
your
position,
you
would
require
a
search
warrant.
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if
they
find
the
narcotics
and
that
using
the
term
inventory
search,
it
would
still
be
proper.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
what
we
just
held
in
robinsons?
unknown
speaker
but
the
reason
that
it
could
be
conducted,
because
they
had
the
right
to
take
the
man
under
custody
and
therefore
they
had
a
right
to
make
this
search.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
agree
with
you
that
the
facts
are
quite
distinguishable
but
what
i
was
questioning
was
your
suggestion
that
there
is
some
non
sequitur
about
saying
that
when
a
man
is
arrested
his
fourth
amendment
rights
are
diminished
because
certainly
they
are
not
diminished
for
purpose
of
--
they
are
diminished
for
a
purposes
of
search
incident
to
that
arrest.
unknown
speaker
what
about
i
guess
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean.
where
was
the
car
search
there?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
it
have
been
reasonable
if
they
had
searched
his
clothing
for
these
paint
scrapings
right
at
the
moment
of
his
arrest?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
point
in
this
process
was
it
–
would
it
have
been
reasonable
to
search
his
clothing
with
his
paint
scrapings
without
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
for
example
--
unknown
speaker
had
they
noticed
the
scrapings
on
the
sill
before
they
took
him
to
the
station
house?
unknown
speaker
and
at
the
station
house,
proceeded
immediately
on
booking
him
as
per
this,
take
his
clothes
off
so
that
they
could
examine
it
to
see
if
they
can
find
the
scrapings.
would
that
might
be
all
right?
unknown
speaker
but
he
thinks
up
pretty
far
--
unknown
speaker
you’re
assuming
the
validity
of
the
arrest?
unknown
speaker
for
the
purpose
of
answering
this
question.
unknown
speaker
there's
nothing
in
the
robinson
case
that
says
that
robinson’s
clothes
could
have
been
taken
off
at
the
time
he
was
arrested.
no,
but
there
is
a
lot
that
says
that
they
could
be
searched.
if
you
forgive
the
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
suppose,
putting
to
you
again
the,
before
they
put
him
in
the
car,
they
had
detected
the
paint
scrapings
on
the
sill
of
the
post
office
and
at
that
time
said,
“take
your
clothes
off.
we
want
to
examine
and
see
if
there
are
any
paint
scrapings
on
your
clothing.”
unknown
speaker
these
are
the
areas?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
you
gave
respondent
one
too?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
would
make
a
difference
mr.
korman?
would
you
have
a
different
case
if
routinely
they
made
anyone
who
was
jailed
change
into
regular
prison
garment?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
if
i
understand
your
answer
correctly,
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
if
the
clothes
have
been
taking
away
from
them
three
weeks
after
their
arrest?
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
say
that,
that
that
was
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
ground?
unknown
speaker
so
you
could
have
done
it
two
years
after
his
arrest,
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
be
still
be
incident
to
his
arrest?
unknown
speaker
no,
no
that
was
so
much
chronic
over
hearing
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
and
there
was
no
--
that
case
did
not
involve
the
claim
at
all
of
a
search
incident
to
arrest.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
say
that
you
wouldn’t
so
far
seek
search
them
in
terms
of
probable
cause
to
search?
let’s
say
arrest
for
continued
custody
or
against
to
have
a
right
to
search
whether
you
have
probable
cause
to
search
the
proving
or
not.
unknown
speaker
but
the
man
was
out
on
bail?
if
you’re
looking
for
evidence
of
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don’t
have
to
that
probable
--
unknown
speaker
assume
as
you
had
probable
cause
to
believe
and
then
committed
the
crime
to
arrest.
unknown
speaker
mr.
korman,
would
you
say
that
the
search
conducted
in
the
jail
of
these
people’s
clothes
has
to
have
a
separate
justification
by
way
of

even
though
it’s
not
subject

requirement?
unknown
speaker
well,
reasonable
under
the
sense
of
the
fourth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
i
understood
your
answer.
it’s
not
reasonable
in
the,
i
mean
your
use
of
the
word
“reasonable”
is
not
in
the
fourth
amendment
sense
but
it
is
in
the
fourteenth,
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
sense
like
rochin
against
california.
unknown
speaker
well,
fourteenth
--
unknown
speaker
because
you
were
talking
about
harassment?
and
that’s
--
unknown
speaker
but
no
warrant.
unknown
speaker
it
is
probable
cause
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
so
it
seems
to
be
(inaudible)
the
case
that
where
there
is
not
any
probable
cause
but
you
can
nevertheless
searched
in
jail?
unknown
speaker
when
he
searched
him,
you
had
probable
cause
and
i
take
it
for
the
arrest.
unknown
speaker
and
mainly
that
you
have
been
–
that
he

committed
this

unknown

and
at

you

wouldn’t

unknown
speaker
well,
he
had
been

unknown

well
then,
then
maybe
i
don’t
understand
your
argument.
i
thought
that

not
that

but
it’s
not

it’s

unknown

and
therefore
the

so

the

is
valid
in
your

even

right?
unknown

i

for
that
type
of
search
as
i
understand
it
unless
there
was
some
reason
to
believe
he
had
been
a
recipient
of
a
weapon
secreted
into
the
jail
or
drugs
or
the
like.
unknown
speaker
do
you
draw
that
distinction?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you’d
say
a
man
who
is
in
jail
loses
his
fifth
amendment
rights
also?
unknown
speaker
a
man
in
jail.
unknown
speaker
self-incrimination.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
true
on
the
street
then
too.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
true
on
the
street
then
because
it’s
only
minimal.
unknown
speaker
empty
his
pockets?
unknown
speaker
i
say
empty
his
pockets?
unknown
speaker
not
yet.
unknown
speaker
you
said
not
yet
rather
hopefully.
unknown
speaker
and
looking
thoroughly
what
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
are
that
involve
his
rights
to
privacy?
unknown
speaker
same
as
others?
unknown
speaker
well,
all
these
rights
become
modified
once
a
person
becomes
--
unknown
speaker
it’s
stated
in
the
petition
for
a
certiorari
that
the
question
presented
is
whether
what
happened
here
was
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
when
there
was
--
it
states
that
there
was
a
lawful
arrest
after
he
has
been
unlawfully
arrested.
i
don’t
have
before
me
here
your
response
to
that
petition
and
maybe
you
did
not
make
one.
but
that
is
the
question,
i
wonder
if
it
is
open
to
you
to
make
the
argument
that
the
arrest
was
unlawful.
unknown
speaker
or
whether
you
accepted
the
question
as
framed
by
the
government.
unknown
speaker
but
you
don’t
probably
argue
it.
unknown
speaker
what’s
this
other
paper
that
mr.
smith
that
you
describe
in
the
courts
that
--
i
don't
know
understand.
unknown
speaker
you
haven’t
seen
it
either?
unknown
speaker
i
gather
this
is
on
file
list.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
the
likely
able
search
where
he
abandoned
--go
arrest
and
search
in
his
own
room,
in
the
hotel
and
he
had
thrown
stuff
in
the
waste
paper
basket,
the
court
held
that
that
was
abandoned?
so
he
no
longer
could
complain
of
its
seizure
and
its
use.
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
a
sort
of
situation
that
chief
justice
suggests?
unknown
speaker
in
this
connection
let
me
ask
the
question
with
you
which
i
asked
mr.
korman.
suppose
routinely,
that
this
jail,
they
issued
prison
guard,
would
you
have
a
different
case?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
were,
instead
of
being
in
a
jail,
just
after
arrest,
if
he
were
a
convict
in
the
state
penitentiary,
would
a
search
warrant
be
necessary
for
the
compulsory
exchange
of
clothing
and
the
examination
of
his
pockets
there?
unknown
speaker
i
take
it.
the
point
of
distinction
you
are
drawing
if
i
understood
you
correctly
was
this
was
taken
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
search.
unknown
speaker
and
if
that
is
so
then
why
isn’t
the
answer
to
my
penitentiary
inmates
situation
exactly
the
same?
unknown
speaker
because
they
take
the
objects
in
the
clothes
and
i
suppose
package
them
and
suppose
entirely
returned.
unknown
speaker
it’s
the
idea
of
an
inventory
search.
unknown
speaker
the
trouble
with
your
posture
here,
suppose
the
warden
of
the
state
penitentiary
is
aware
that
there
are
narcotics
in
the
prison
and
so
he
asks
every
inmate
to
change
clothing.
as
i
understand
your
position,
you
would
require
a
search
warrant.
unknown
speaker
well,
even
if
they
find
the
narcotics
and
that
using
the
term
inventory
search,
it
would
still
be
proper.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
what
we
just
held
in
robinsons?
unknown
speaker
but
the
reason
that
it
could
be
conducted,
because
they
had
the
right
to
take
the
man
under
custody
and
therefore
they
had
a
right
to
make
this
search.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
agree
with
you
that
the
facts
are
quite
distinguishable
but
what
i
was
questioning
was
your
suggestion
that
there
is
some
non
sequitur
about
saying
that
when
a
man
is
arrested
his
fourth
amendment
rights
are
diminished
because
certainly
they
are
not
diminished
for
purpose
of
--
they
are
diminished
for
a
purposes
of
search
incident
to
that
arrest.
unknown
speaker
what
about
i
guess
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean.
where
was
the
car
search
there?
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
it
have
been
reasonable
if
they
had
searched
his
clothing
for
these
paint
scrapings
right
at
the
moment
of
his
arrest?
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
point
in
this
process
was
it
–
would
it
have
been
reasonable
to
search
his
clothing
with
his
paint
scrapings
without
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
for
example
--
unknown
speaker
had
they
noticed
the
scrapings
on
the
sill
before
they
took
him
to
the
station
house?
unknown
speaker
and
at
the
station
house,
proceeded
immediately
on
booking
him
as
per
this,
take
his
clothes
off
so
that
they
could
examine
it
to
see
if
they
can
find
the
scrapings.
would
that
might
be
all
right?
unknown
speaker
but
he
thinks
up
pretty
far
--
unknown
speaker
you’re
assuming
the
validity
of
the
arrest?
unknown
speaker
for
the
purpose
of
answering
this
question.
unknown
speaker
there's
nothing
in
the
robinson
case
that
says
that
robinson’s
clothes
could
have
been
taken
off
at
the
time
he
was
arrested.
no,
but
there
is
a
lot
that
says
that
they
could
be
searched.
if
you
forgive
the
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
suppose,
putting
to
you
again
the,
before
they
put
him
in
the
car,
they
had
detected
the
paint
scrapings
on
the
sill
of
the
post
office
and
at
that
time
said,
“take
your
clothes
off.
we
want
to
examine
and
see
if
there
are
any
paint
scrapings
on
your
clothing.”
