mr.

the
puerto
rican
statutes
which
the
district
court
declared
unconstitutional
facially
allow
the
taking
of
an
innocent
man’s
property
thereby
imposing
a
penalty
upon
one
not
significantly
involved
in
a
criminal
enterprise.
the

do
not
afford
opportunity
to
contest
the
seizure
and
forfeiture
before
it
actually
takes
place.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
yes.
appellants
have
suggested
that
there
is
a
difference
in
the
statutes
between
the
actual
taking
and
the
moment
of
forfeiture.
the
statutes
do
not
make
such
a
distinction.
they
merely
provide
for
the
forfeiture,
although
property
which
may
be
used
or
is
used
or
has
been
used
in
connection
with
a
criminal
enterprise.
from
the
moment
that
the,
in
this
case,
the
superintendent,
makes
the
determination
that
the
property
is
forfeitable,
the
only
thing
that
can
happen
is
for
a
filing
of
a
challenge
to
that
forfeiture
after
it
has
been
seized
and
that
challenge
would
not
be
of
help
unless
the
challenger
happens
to
fall
within
one
of
the
--
two
of
the
exceptions
which
have
been
judicially
permitted
to
that
forfeiture.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
i
don’t
even
think
that
such
a
showing
would
exempt
--
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
that’s
precisely
it.
i
don’t
see
the
point.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
it
does
exempt
to
--
it
gives
an
opportunity,
in
the
case
of
a
common
carrier,
to
come
into
court
and
show
--
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
yes.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
there
has
been
no
case
regarding
whether
that
showing
could
be
made.
the
fact
is
that
once
the
determination
has
been
taken
by
the
superintendent
of
police
or
even
by
a
mere
policeman,
as
it
appears
from
the
statute,
that
this
vessel
may
be
used
to
transport
or
to
facilitate
the
transportation,
concealment
or
possession
of
marijuana,
then
it
is
subject
to
forfeiture
as
well.
there
is
no
limitation,
as
i
see
it
from
the
statute,
which
would
limit
the
forfeiture
to
the
case
where
marijuana
is
actually
found
on
board.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
i
don’t
think
it
would
defeat
the
forfeiture
under
these
particular
statutes.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
oh!
they
could
be
raised,
but
whether
that
would
defeat
forfeiture
is
--
has
not
yet
been
decided.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
that
is
one
of
the
defects
of
the
statute,
i
think,
which
--
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
no,
it
hasn’t
been
admitted.
the
only
admission
or
the
only
violation
which
appears
on
the
record
is
possession
of
marijuana
on
board
the
vessel.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
well,
possession
under
--
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
it
is
illegal,
yes.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
yes.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
yes,
that
is
what
it
appears
to
have
happened.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
exactly.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
the
lessee
is
guilty.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
well,
the
decision
relied
on
fuentes
and
in
coin
and
currency.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
appellant’s
argument
based
upon
the
lease
contract
between
the
parties
of
possible
compensation
from
collateral
sources
and
upon
the
alleged
failure
to
exhaust
contractual
remedies
are
irrelevant,
in
my
opinion,
since
they
were
neither
raised
nor
argued
in
the
court
below
and
have
no
basis
on
the
record
before
this
court.
thus,
the
issue
squarely
posed
is,
what
is
the
constitutional
norm
required
for
forfeiture
under
statute
such
as
these
in
question.
in
the
court
below,
appellants
relied
on
the
facial
validity
of
the
statutes
and
that
being
the
sole
issue
before
the
court
that
was
the
only
question
resolved.
appellant’s
contention
that
the
norm
applicable
would
be
that
of
the
probable
cause,
as
required
of
the
fourth
amendment,
would
not
save
these
statutes
as
the
statutes
do
not
impose
that
even
that
minimal
requirement
be
observed.
for
example,
at
the
moment
of
seizure
which
took
place
more
than
two
months
after
the
arrest
of
the
lessee,
no
probable
cause
existed
then
for
forfeiture.
none
has
been
shown
to
have
existed
on
the
record
of
this
case.
but,
even
if
probable
cause
were
accepted
as
the
applicable
standard,
the
fourth
require
--
the
fourth
amendment
requires
that
a
warrant
be
issued.
this
record
does
not
show
--
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
the
seizure,
for
the
seizure.
now,
the
record
here
fails
to
show
--
the
only
exception
to
the
issuance
of
a
warrant
has
been
staged
in
many
times
by
this
court
and
that’s
where
exigent
circumstances
exist
which
would
justify
any
officer
to
proceed
to
arrest,
to
seize,
and
to
search.
the
record
here
fails
to
show
any
such
circumstances.
the
issuance
of
a
warrant
requires
a
prior
determination
by
a
judicial
officer,
not
by
the
officer
of
the
executive
branch
even
though
he
may
be
a
high
officer,
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
appellants.
the
statutes
here
in
question,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
facially
appear
to
permit
that
such
a
determination
can
even
be
made
by
a
mere
policeman.
now,
the
danger
from
such
--
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
the
record
doesn’t
show
and
i
don’t
know
whether
that
--
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
well,
your
honor,
the
thing
is
that
the
statute
here
--
the
seizure
in
this
case
was
for
forfeiture.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
yes,
that’s
what
appears
from
the
record.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
that
would
depend
upon
what
the
circumstances
were
at
the
time
of
arrest.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
if
the
policeman
walks
upon
the
boat
and
finds
the
person
in
possession
using
marijuana
at
that
time,
he
is
entitled
to
make
an
arrest.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
no,
i
don’t
even
know
how
the
arrest
came
about
or
how
it
was
affected.
now,
appellee
respectfully
submits
that
the
appropriate
norm
is
a
hybrid
consisting
of
a
prior
hearing
as
required
by
the
fifth
amendment
with
notice
except
in
those
situations
where
exigent
circumstances
are
present.
and
even
with
such
a
prior
hearing,
the
statutes
here
in
question
are
still
facially
invalid
as
they
have
been
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico,
since
innocence
is
not
a
defense
to
the
taking
and
deprivation
of
one’s
property
as
long
as
that
property
was
lawfully
in
possession
of
the
violator.
appellants
have
emphasized
the
need
of
forfeiture
as
an
element
of
law
enforcement.
but,
i
ask
how
can
the
imposition
of
a
post-factum
penalty
deter
violations
unless
there
has
been
a
priori
intent
by
the
person
that
is
being
penalized?
certainly,
by
penalizing
the
innocent,
the
criminal
is
not
going
to
be
deterred.
it
can
only
force
that
innocent
out
of
business.
now,
where
seizure
is
contemporaneous
with
an
otherwise
lawful
arrest,
the
objectives
of
deterrence
are
obtained
and
it
is
constitutionally
defensible
so
long
as
the
defense
of
innocence
is
allowed.
these
statutes
do
not.
on
the
other
hand,
where
seizure
and
forfeiture
is
remote
in
time
from
the
arrest,
no
objective
other
than
the
imposition
of
a
penalty
upon
an
innocent
person
is
attained.
if
an
appellant
argues
the
purpose
was
to
prevent
reuse
of
the
vessel
in
unlawful
activities,
the
delay
of
two
months,
in
seizing
the
vessel,
is
inexplicable.
it
merely
highlights
the
true
objectives
of
the
statutes,
which
is
the
imposition
of
a
penalty
regardless
of
whether
it
falls
upon
the
guilty
or
upon
the
innocent.
the
norm
proposed
is
not
impossible
of
legislative
formulation,
nor
difficult
in
practical
application,
except
where
exigent
circumstances
are
present.
a
hearing
and
when
those
circumstances
are
present,
then
the
needs
of
law
enforcement
would
be
fulfilled
by
the
immediate
seizure.
but
in
other
circumstances,
prior
notice
and
hearing
should
be
constitutionally
required
and
innocence
should
be
a
defense.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
no,
but
the
seizure
of
contraband,
your
honor,
is
precisely
one
of
the
things
that
may
be
summarily
seized
because
they
are
illegal
per
se.
now,
there’s
nothing
illegal
about
a
vessel
or
an
automobile.
and
certainly,
if
the
seizure
has
to
be
made,
the
seizure
of
the
vessel
has
to
be
made
in
order
to
prevent
the
escape
of
the
arrestee
or
to
prevent
some
other
illegal
purpose
or
the
destruction
of
the
evidence,
then
that
would
be
one
of
the
exigent
circumstances
which
would
warrant
the
actual
seizure.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
well,
your
honor,
if
the
contraband
is
there
and
has
not
yet
been
seized,
that
may
very
well
be
the
case.
but,
when
the
contraband
has
already
been
seized
and
the
lessee
has
been
arrested,
where
is
the
exigent
circumstances
in
requiring
the
seizure
of
the
vessel
when
it
takes
place
two
months
after
the
original
arrest
and
seizure
of
the
evidence.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
well
the
boat,
in
the
first
place,
your
honor,
does
not
belong
to
the
lessee.
he
--
i
don’t
think
he
would
have
an
interest
in
taking
it
away
since
it
belongs
to
someone
else.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
from
the
record
of
this
case,
it
does
not
appear.
now,
i’d
be
--
i
have
suggested
in
my
brief
that
that
precisely
is
one
of
the
issues
which
should
have
been
raised
in
the
court
below
and
adjudicated
down
below
so
that
this
court
could
then
have
had
a
proper
record.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
here
to
show
that
that
there
was
--
that
that
insurance
actually
could
exist.
the
fact
or
that
the
insurance
itself
provided
for
the
payment
in
cases
of
forfeiture.
now
--
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
it
does
not
appear
so
from
the
record,
but
that
was
in
fact
done.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
yes.
it
also
has
the
right
to
seek
repossession.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
of
the
moment
of
the
violation
the
contract
was
breached
and
the
lessor
became
entitled
to
acquire
possession
of
the
vessel.
now,
the
extremely,
i
think,
brought
sweep
of
these
particular
statutes
cannot
be
more
emphatically
exemplified
than
by
considering
the
fact
that
the
possible
acquittal
of
the
alleged
violator
will
not
result
in
the
return
of
the
property
nor
in
the
payment
of
compensation.
this
circumstance,
i
believe,
is
--
not
only
this
circumstance,
but
this
set
of
statutes,
i
believe,
is
way
beyond
what
is
constitutionally
permissible
and
the
only
words
to
describe
the
statutes
which
i
could
find
were
those
of
mr.
justice
white
in
his
dissent
in
fuentes
versus
shevin,
that,
to
me,
seem
like
a
barbaric
handover
from
bygone
days.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions
--
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi

chief
justice
burger

may
it
please

the
lease
contract
between
the
parties
of
possible
compensation
from
collateral
sources
and
upon
the
alleged
failure
to
exhaust
contractual
remedies
are
irrelevant,
in
my
opinion,
since
they
were
neither
raised
nor
argued
in
the
court
below
and
have
no
basis
on
the
record
before
this
court.
thus,
the
issue
squarely
posed
is,
what
is
the
constitutional
norm
required
for
forfeiture
under
statute
such
as
these
in
question.
in
the
court
below,
appellants
relied
on
the
facial
validity
of
the
statutes
and
that
being
the
sole
issue
before
the
court
that
was
the
only
question
resolved.
appellant’s
contention
that
the
norm
applicable
would
be
that
of
the
probable
cause,
as
required
of
the
fourth
amendment,
would
not
save
these
statutes
as
the
statutes
do
not
impose
that
even
that
minimal
requirement
be
observed.
for
example,
at
the
moment
of
seizure
which
took
place
more
than
two
months
after
the
arrest
of
the
lessee,
no
probable
cause
existed
then
for
forfeiture.
none
has
been
shown
to
have
existed
on
the
record
of
this
case.
but,
even
if
probable
cause
were
accepted
as
the
applicable
standard,
the
fourth
require
--
the
fourth
amendment
requires
that
a
warrant
be
issued.
this
record
does
not
show
--
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
the
seizure,
for
the
seizure.
now,
the
record
here
fails
to
show
--
the
only
exception
to
the
issuance
of
a
warrant
has
been
staged
in
many
times
by
this
court
and
that’s
where
exigent
circumstances
exist
which
would
justify
any
officer
to
proceed
to
arrest,
to
seize,
and
to
search.
the
record
here
fails
to
show
any
such
circumstances.
the
issuance
of
a
warrant
requires
a
prior
determination
by
a
judicial
officer,
not
by
the
officer
of
the
executive
branch
even
though
he
may
be
a
high
officer,
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
appellants.
the
statutes
here
in
question,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
facially
appear
to
permit
that
such
a
determination
can
even
be
made
by
a
mere
policeman.
now,
the
danger
from
such
--
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
the
record
doesn’t
show
and
i
don’t
know
whether
that
--
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
well,
your
honor,
the
thing
is
that
the
statute
here
--
the
seizure
in
this
case
was
for
forfeiture.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
yes,
that’s
what
appears
from
the
record.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
that
would
depend
upon
what
the
circumstances
were
at
the
time
of
arrest.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
if
the
policeman
walks
upon
the
boat
and
finds
the
person
in
possession
using
marijuana
at
that
time,
he
is
entitled
to
make
an
arrest.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
no,
i
don’t
even
know
how
the
arrest
came
about
or
how
it
was
affected.
now,
appellee
respectfully
submits
that
the
appropriate
norm
is
a
hybrid
consisting
of
a
prior
hearing
as
required
by
the
fifth
amendment
with
notice
except
in
those
situations
where
exigent
circumstances
are
present.
and
even
with
such
a
prior
hearing,
the
statutes
here
in
question
are
still
facially
invalid
as
they
have
been
construed
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico,
since
innocence
is
not
a
defense
to
the
taking
and
deprivation
of
one’s
property
as
long
as
that
property
was
lawfully
in
possession
of
the
violator.
appellants
have
emphasized
the
need
of
forfeiture
as
an
element
of
law
enforcement.
but,
i
ask
how
can
the
imposition
of
a
post-factum
penalty
deter
violations
unless
there
has
been
a
priori
intent
by
the
person
that
is
being
penalized?
certainly,
by
penalizing
the
innocent,
the
criminal
is
not
going
to
be
deterred.
it
can
only
force
that
innocent
out
of
business.
now,
where
seizure
is
contemporaneous
with
an
otherwise
lawful
arrest,
the
objectives
of
deterrence
are
obtained
and
it
is
constitutionally
defensible
so
long
as
the
defense
of
innocence
is
allowed.
these
statutes
do
not.
on
the
other
hand,
where
seizure
and
forfeiture
is
remote
in
time
from
the
arrest,
no
objective
other
than
the
imposition
of
a
penalty
upon
an
innocent
person
is
attained.
if
an
appellant
argues
the
purpose
was
to
prevent
reuse
of
the
vessel
in
unlawful
activities,
the
delay
of
two
months,
in
seizing
the
vessel,
is
inexplicable.
it
merely
highlights
the
true
objectives
of
the
statutes,
which
is
the
imposition
of
a
penalty
regardless
of
whether
it
falls
upon
the
guilty
or
upon
the
innocent.
the
norm
proposed
is
not
impossible
of
legislative
formulation,
nor
difficult
in
practical
application,
except
where
exigent
circumstances
are
present.
a
hearing
and
when
those
circumstances
are
present,
then
the
needs
of
law
enforcement
would
be
fulfilled
by
the
immediate
seizure.
but
in
other
circumstances,
prior
notice
and
hearing
should
be
constitutionally
required
and
innocence
should
be
a
defense.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
no,
but
the
seizure
of
contraband,
your
honor,
is
precisely
one
of
the
things
that
may
be
summarily
seized
because
they
are
illegal
per
se.
now,
there’s
nothing
illegal
about
a
vessel
or
an
automobile.
and
certainly,
if
the
seizure
has
to
be
made,
the
seizure
of
the
vessel
has
to
be
made
in
order
to
prevent
the
escape
of
the
arrestee
or
to
prevent
some
other
illegal
purpose
or
the
destruction
of
the
evidence,
then
that
would
be
one
of
the
exigent
circumstances
which
would
warrant
the
actual
seizure.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
well,
your
honor,
if
the
contraband
is
there
and
has
not
yet
been
seized,
that
may
very
well
be
the
case.
but,
when
the
contraband
has
already
been
seized
and
the
lessee
has
been
arrested,
where
is
the
exigent
circumstances
in
requiring
the
seizure
of
the
vessel
when
it
takes
place
two
months
after
the
original
arrest
and
seizure
of
the
evidence.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
well
the
boat,
in
the
first
place,
your
honor,
does
not
belong
to
the
lessee.
he
--
i
don’t
think
he
would
have
an
interest
in
taking
it
away
since
it
belongs
to
someone
else.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
from
the
record
of
this
case,
it
does
not
appear.
now,
i’d
be
--
i
have
suggested
in
my
brief
that
that
precisely
is
one
of
the
issues
which
should
have
been
raised
in
the
court
below
and
adjudicated
down
below
so
that
this
court
could
then
have
had
a
proper
record.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
here
to
show
that
that
there
was
--
that
that
insurance
actually
could
exist.
the
fact
or
that
the
insurance
itself
provided
for
the
payment
in
cases
of
forfeiture.
now
--
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
it
does
not
appear
so
from
the
record,
but
that
was
in
fact
done.
mr.
gustavo
a.
gelpi
yes.
it
also
has
the
right
to
seek
repossession.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
of
the
moment
of
the
violation
the
contract
was
breached
and
the
lessor
became
entitled
to
acquire
possession
of
the
vessel.
now,
the
extremely,
i
think,
brought
sweep
of
these
particular
statutes
cannot
be
more
emphatically
exemplified
than
by
considering
the
fact
that
the
possible
acquittal
of
the
alleged
violator
will
not
result
in
the
return
of
the
property
nor
in
the
payment
of
compensation.
this
circumstance,
i
believe,
is
--
not
only
this
circumstance,
but
this
set
of
statutes,
i
believe,
is
way
beyond
what
is
constitutionally
permissible
and
the
only
words
to
describe
the
statutes
which
i
could
find
were
those
of
mr.
justice
white
in
his
dissent
in
fuentes
versus
shevin,
that,
to
me,
seem
like
a
barbaric
handover
from
bygone
days.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions
--
