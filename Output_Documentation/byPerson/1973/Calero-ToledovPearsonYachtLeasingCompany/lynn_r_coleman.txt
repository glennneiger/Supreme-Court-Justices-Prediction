mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
lynn
coleman.
i
appear
as
special
counsel
for
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico,
both
of
the
appellants
in
this
case
being
officials
of
the
commonwealth.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
by
the
district
court
of
puerto
rico
sitting
as
a
three-judge
court
which
declared
unconstitutional
a
portion
of
the
controlled
substances
act
of
the
commonwealth
as
well
as
the
uniform
seizure
and
forfeiture
statute
of
the
commonwealth.
the
ground
for
this
decision
was
that
these
provisions
were
unconstitutional
on
their
face
in
that
they
fail
to
provide
for
notice
and
an
opportunity
for
hearing
prior
to
a
seizure
in
connection
with
a
forfeiture
proceeding
and
that,
from
a
substantive
standpoint,
they
provided
for
the
taking
of
the
property
of
a
person
who
was
innocent
of
the
crime
for
which
the
property
was
seized
and
the
court
in
so
holding
rely
them
to
fairly
recent
decisions
of
this
case
of
this
case
--
this
court,
fuentes
versus
shevin,
and
coin
and
currency.
the
particular
brief
statement
of
the
facts
involved
would
be
that
pearson
yacht
leasing
company
leased
a
yacht
to
a
man
named
olson
which,
in
our
brief,
we
referred
to
as
the
lessee.
the
lease
is,
in
many
respects,
familiar
to
--
similar
to
a
conditional
sale
in
that
the
lessee
would
enjoy
full
possession
of
the
vessel.
the
lease
was
for
a
five-year
term.
the
lessee
had
the
obligation
to
pay
rent,
that
obligation
would
not
cease
in
the
event
anything
happened
to
the
boat
specifically
indicating
that
forfeiture
would
be
one
of
the
events
which
would
not
interrupt
the
lessee’s
obligation
to
pay
rent.
the
lessee
had
to
insure
the
interest
of
the
lessor
against
all
eventualities.
the
lessee
was
obliged
to
use
the
boat
only
for
lawful
purposes
and
alike.
it
contained
provisions
which
you
would
expect
to
find
in
a
conditional
sale
contract
or
in
a
conventional
mortgage
if
the
seller
of
products
had
elected
to
allow
his
vendee
to
take
title
and,
instead,
reserve
a
purely
security
interest.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
don’t
know
that
it
would
have
in
this
case,
your
honor.
the
court
below
treated
the
lessor
as
if
he
were
the
owner
of
the
vessel
and
really
did
not
examine
the
kind
of
a
case
which
you
would
have
where
you
have
parties,
both
of
them
have
some
interest
in
the
vessel.
i
think
that
the
effect
of
the
puerto
rican
statute
and
many
other
statutes,
both
of
the
united
states
and
other
states,
could
be
to
--
in
a
forfeiture
proceeding,
to
forfeit
effectively
the
interest
of
the
mortgagor.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
yes,
$1
after
the
end
of
5
years.
that’s
true.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
think
that’s
true.
in
any
event,
the
lessee
was
found
in
possession
of
marijuana.
presumably,
he
was
arrested
in
criminal
proceedings
instituted
against
him.
some
time
after
that
discovery
of
marijuana
on
the
vessel,
it
was
seized
pursuant
to
the
statute.
the
statute
operates
in
this
way.
there
must
be
a
determination
by
a
high
governmental
official,
either
the
superintendent
of
police
for
the
entire
island,
the
attorney
general
of
the
department
or
the
secretary
of
treasury
in
puerto
rico
that
there
has
been
an
offense
for
which
the
property
becomes
forfeitable.
the
offense
is
described
in
the
controlled
substances
act.
process
is
issued
by
such
officer
and
pursuant
to
that,
the
vessel
is
seized
without
notice.
within
15
days
--
i
mean,
immediately
notice
is
to
be
given,
within
--
and
the
--
it’s
to
be
given
to
all
owners,
all
persons
who
are
known
to
have
an
interest,
within
15
days,
they
can
challenge
the
seizure
and
forfeiture
by
instituting
proceedings
in
the
commonwealth
courts.
the
lessee
was
notified.
he
was
on
record
with
the
puerto
rican
authorities
as
the
owner
of
the
boat.
the
puerto
rican
authorities
presumably
had
no
knowledge
of
the
lessor’s
interest.
the
lessor
consequently
was
not
notified.
he
did
not
discover
the
seizure
and
forfeiture
of
the
vessel
until
some
months
later
when
it
elected
to
sue
in
federal
court
rather
than
in
the
commonwealth
courts
pursuant
to
the
statute.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
believe
so.
i
think
the
--
that
registration
statute,
the
form
which
there
is
registration,
provides
for
other
owners.
the
record
is
really
silent
on
that
though,
your
honor.
before
proceeding
to
the
burden
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
mention
one
thing.
the
solicitor
general
filed
a
brief
in
this
case,
which
i
think
is
very
excellent
help
for
brief
this
past
friday.
it
particularly
places
in
perspective
the
impact
of
an
affirmance
of
this
decision
on
a
number
of
federal
laws.
there
is
one
thing
that
we
--
i
would
call
attention
to.
on
page
5
of
the
solicitor’s
brief
in
a
footnote,
it
is
stated
that
the
statutes
involved
were
challenged
as
violating
both
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
below,
in
its
holding,
made
no
distinction
whatsoever.
they
based
it
on
due
process
of
law
and
a
concept
of
taking
without
just
compensation
without
specifying
either
the
fifth
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
solicitor
then
says
it
has
been
held
that,
to
the
extent
the
constitution
applies
directly
to
the
laws
of
puerto
rico,
they
are
subject
to
the
fifth
amendment.
a
1947
decision
of
the
first
circuit
is
cited.
that
case
does
hold
then
that
that,
of
course,
was
before
the
commonwealth
was
created
in
1952.
we
suggest
that
that
makes
a
substantial
difference.
since
the
creation
of
the
commonwealth,
the
first
circuit
has
consistently
declined
to
decide
that
question
as
to
whether
the
fifth
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
applicable.
so
has
this
court
in
the
only
other
case
to
come
directly
from
the
commonwealth
to
this
court,
that
being
the
fornaris
case
which
was
decided
about
three
years
ago.
the
commonwealth
did
not
brief
this
question.
we
do
not
regard
as
essential
to
a
determination
in
this
case
whether
the
fifth
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
is
applicable
to
the
commonwealth.
it
has
been
true
and
accepted
for
many
years
that
due
process
fully
applies
in
the
commonwealth.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i’m
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
well,
there
could
--
there
can
be,
i
think,
a
respectable
analysis
made
that
it
is
before
the
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
yes.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
yes.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
well,
i
would
not
attempt
to
argue
it
now,
your
honor.
if
this
subject
were
to
be
gone
into,
we
would
ask
leave
to
file
a
supplemental
brief.
i
think
it’s
very
complicated.
there
are
also
problems
with
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
your
honor
has
put
his
finger
on
the
point.
the
question
is,
is
it
a
territory?
the
--
when
the
commonwealth
was
created,
it
is
the
view
generally,
i
think,
of
the
commonwealth
that
it
is
not
longer
a
territory.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
well,
i
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
don’t
think
that
that
would
be
can
absolutely
agreed
to,
your
honor.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
what
i’m
suggesting
merely
is
that
a
proper
determination
of
that
issue
would
involve
a
very
detailed
analysis
of
the
creation
of
the
commonwealth.
it
would
have
implications
far
beyond
this
case
where
those
implications
are
not
now
before
the
court.
it
does
not
appear
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
well,
it
is
certainly
not
a
state
of
the
union
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
but
as
to
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
well,
i
would
not
attempt
to
go
into
that
this
time.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
would
assume
that
it
would,
your
honor.
but,
i
don’t
know
that
it’s
necessary
to
decide
which.
it’s
been
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
don’t
believe
you
do.[laughter]
i
just
wanted
to
clarify
that
since
the
solicitor
had
made
the
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
exactly
right.
i’ve
hardly
clarified
it
here.
we
submit
that
the
court
below’s
holding
that
notice
and
hearing
prior
to
seizure
are
constitutionally
necessary
by
way
of
this
court’s
decision
in
fuentes
v.
shevin
was
wrong.
we
think
that
that
is
an
unauthorized
extension
and
undue
extension
of
a
holding.
first
of
all,
there’s
a
serious
question
whether
pearson
could
have
standing
to
complain
of
seizure
to
assert
that
they
were
constitutionally
entitled
to
notice
and
hearing,
assuming
such
a
requirement
were
to
exist
because
pearson
had
no
possessory
interest
in
this
yacht.
the
yacht
was
in
the
possession
of
the
lessee
pursuant
to
the
lease.
under
puerto
rican
law,
there
is
no
change
of
title
in
a
forfeiture
proceeding
until
a
forfeiture
occurs
through
the
yacht’s
temporarily
in
possession
of
the
commonwealth.
we
do
not
see
that
that
seizure
itself
affected
the
rights
of
the
lessor.
and
so,
i
would
think
there’s
a
serious
question
of
standing
initially
on
the
merits.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
nor
did
forfeiture,
your
honor.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
true.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
right.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
true.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
of
course,
there’s
a
question.
it
stipulated
that
he
was
never
note
that
--
the
lessor
was
never
notified
pursuant
to
the
statute.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
he
obtained
actual
notice.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
no,
no.
but,
the
puerto
rican
courts
have
said
the
15
days
doesn’t
run
until
the
person
involved
was
actually
notified.
so
now,
if
notice
pursuant
to
the
statute
is
required,
then
he
haven’t
been
notified
yet.
if
actual
notice
would’ve
sufficed,
15
--
after
he
found
out
about
it,
more
than
15
days
elapsed
before
he
decided
to
go
to
federal
court.
we
argue
in
our
brief
that
he
really
is
not
entitled
to
complain
of
forfeiture
either
for
that
reason,
that
he
forwent
the
rights
that
the
puerto
rican
statute
confers
upon
him.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
until
there’s
notice.
whether
actual
notice
will
suffice,
i’m
not
sure,
but
it
may
be
that
only
notice
by
the
--
formal
notice
by
the
commonwealth
pursuant
to
the
statute
will
suffice.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
exactly
right.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
yes.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
they
would
be
restricted
to
arguing
that
either
the
crime
was
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
there
wasn’t
any
marijuana
or
something
of
that
nature,
that’s
true.
we,
at
another
point
of
our
brief,
make
the
point
that,
in
our
view,
the
puerto
rican
supreme
court
would’ve
been
quite
free
to
reconsider
a
1967
holding
that
the
statute
would
allow
the
forfeiture
of
the
property
of
an
innocent
person.
and,
that
in
light
of
the
very
strong
tradition
in
this
court
of
giving
deference
to
state
court
determinations,
and
there’s
a
particular
line
of
cases
with
respect
to
the
commonwealth
where
it
appears
that
an
extra
major
deference
might
be
justified.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
they
have
the
option
of
selling
them
or
retaining
them.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
think,
normally,
they
sell
them.
i’m
not
advised
of
it.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
actually,
the
retained
it
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
in
other
words
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
no.
it’s
been
retained,
your
honor,
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
for
official
use.
it’s
a
sailboat.
it
wouldn’t
be
very
usable
by
an
official.
they
have
not
elected
yet
to
sell
it.
there’s
no
time
limit
in
the
statue
on
when
they
have
to
make
the
election.
to
go
to
fuentes
versus
shevin,
in
that
case
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
exactly
right.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
why
the
case
is
very
important
to
the
commonwealth.
the
uniform
seizure
and
forfeiture
statute
brought
together
all
of
the
seizure
and
forfeiture
provisions
in
disparate
parts
of
puerto
rican
code.
and
declaring
this
statute,
on
its
face,
unconstitutional
just
puts
an
end
to
seizure
and
forfeiture
proceedings,
i
think,
is
a
practical
matter
in
puerto
rico.
if
you
have
to
have
notice
before
you
can
seize
property,
in
connection
with
a
criminal
matter
in
leading
to
a
forfeiture
proceeding,
the
seizure
statutes,
i
believe,
are
going
to
be
--
have
their
practicality
seriously
impaired.
but,
in
fuentes
versus
shevin,
this
court
struck
down
the
pennsylvania
in
florida
prejudgment
replevin
statutes,
a
ground
that
they
authorized
the
taking
of
property,
even
though
for
a
short
period
of
time,
without
opportunity
for
notice
and
hearing.
there,
the
creditor
could
invoke
process
of
the
state
to
retrieve
property
in
the
possession
of
another
private
person
solely
on
the
basis
of
his
own
affidavit,
solely
on
the
basis
of
an
ex
parte
proceeding
before
the
clerk
of
the
court.
the
court
carefully
distinguished
other
situations
where
seizure
without
a
prior
hearing
was
justifiable.
it
also
carefully
distinguished
seizure
pursuant
to
a
warrant.
in
our
view,
seizure
under
this
statute
where
there
must
be
a
determination
by
a
responsible
official,
where
there
must
be
processed
issue
is
very
similar
to
seizure
under
a
warrant,
though
not
the
same
thing.
and,
in
fuentes,
the
court
identified
three
criteria
which
have
generally
been
used
to
describe
those
areas
where
there
could
be
seizure
in
advance
of
a
hearing
and
that
is,
is
there
an
important
governmental
interest
served,
was
the
first
criteria
and
i
think
that,
clearly
is
satisfied
by
seizure
statute
looking
to
a
forfeiture.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
the
record
does
not
disclose
that,
your
honor.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
no.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
believe
so.
it’s
stipulated
by
both
parties
that
the
officials
acted
in
punctilious
compliance
with
the
statute.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
yes.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
not
on
this
record.
the
second
criteria
identified
in
fuentes
versus
shevin,
as
justifying
seizure
without
a
hearing,
was
the
need
for
promptness,
i
think
that
obviously
applies
to
a
seizure
proceeding.
the
third
was
that
there’d
be
no
abdication
of
state
power.
in
fuentes,
state
power
could
be
invoked
solely
by
private
persons
for
private
gain
without
any
determination
whatsoever
of
a
--
is
probably
correct.
here,
however,
there
is
a
determination
by
a
high
government
official
that
an
offense
has
been
committed.
the
property
has
been
used
in
connection
with
a
crime
and
the
process
must
be
issued.
we
think
that
this
case
is
clearly
within
the
guidelines
expressed
by
fuentes
which
would
justify
a
seizure
without
prior
hearing.
we
think
this
case
--
this
court’s
decision
in
1971
in
u.s.
versus
thirty-seven
photographs
would
also
clearly
justify
a
seizure
prior
to
hearing
in
connection
with
a
forfeiture
proceeding.
so,
our
conclusion
is
that
that
part
of
the
court’s
decision
was
clearly
an
error.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
no,
no,
no.
i
think
a
hearing
--
i
mean,
a
hearing
is
provided
by
statute
and
a
hearing
is
provided
before
forfeiture.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
and
i
think
there’s
provision
that
the
hearing
be
very
prompt
following
up
on
the
seizure.
i
think
that
satisfies
the
constitutional
requirements.
with
respect
to
the
court’s
holding
that
this
court’s
decision
in
coin
and
currency
is
to
the
effect
that
the
forfeiture
provisions
of
the
puerto
rican
law
must,
in
necessity,
be
unconstitutional
because
they
authorize
the
taking
of
a
person’s
property
if
he
was
innocent
of
the
crime
for
which
the
property
was
--
or
at
least
we
think
that
is
clearly
an
error
as
well.
first,
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
there
is
again
a
standing
question
because
pearson
elected
not
to
avail
himself
of
the
opportunity
presented
by
the
puerto
rican
law
to
within
15
days
of
notice,
be
that
pursuant
to
the
statute
or
after
actual
notice,
to
go
to
court
and
assert
his
rights.
we
also
believe
that
if
they
think
that
it
was
crucial
to
their
rights
that
they’d
be
able
to
show
that
they
were
innocent
of
the
crime
and
that
that
defeat
the
forfeiture,
that
that
would
be
a
question
which
certainly
could
be
litigated
in
the
puerto
rican
courts.
the
statute
does
not
say
you
can
take
the
property
of
one
innocent
of
the
crime,
the
statute
is
silent
on
that.
it
is
presumed
that
that
is
permitted
under
the
statute.
however,
there
had
been
two
other
exceptions
recognized
to
the
statute
for
which
there
is
no
authority
in
the
statute
itself.
those
are,
if
the
property
were
a
common
carrier
or
if
the
property
were
stolen
from
the
lawful
owner.
those
are
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
the
puerto
rican
supreme
court
enact
in
1967
and
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
in
this
court,
the
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i’m
sorry.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
right
and
on
the
strength
of
that
decision,
your
honor,
this
court
said
that
there
was
no
other
way
to
construe
the
statute.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
no,
but
my
primary
argument
of
course,
your
honor,
it
would
be
a
wrong
construction
should
the
court
view
the
constitutional
requirements
as
being
such,
that
this
defense
must
be
permitted.
i
think
that
there
is
that,
under
the
principles
of
construing
a
statute
to
preserve
its
constitutionality
they
would’ve
been
required
to
take
a
look
at
the
statue
and
they
wouldn’t
of
necessity
have
to
abide
by
that
construction.
there
was
an
argument
earlier
in
this
case
that
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
to
allow
the
court,
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico,
to
past
first
of
the
question.
the
commonwealth
withdrew
its
objection
to
the
calling
of
the
three-judge
court.
we
are
not
here
arguing
that
abstention
was
required,
but
i
think
that
there
was
a
duty
on
the
court
to
attempt
to
save
constitutionality
of
the
statute
if
it
thought
it
necessary.
but,
on
the
merits
of
the
coin
and
currency
question,
we
do
not
think
that
coin
and
currency
reached
this
question
at
all.
justice
harlan
there
did
say
that
there
could
be
a
question
under
fifth
amendment
whether
a
statute
authorizing
the
taking
of
one
innocent
of
the
crime
could
be
squared
constitutionally.
he
said
it
is
not
necessary
to
decide
that
question.
there
was
specifically
no
overruling
of
the
many
decisions
of
this
court
which
in
the
past
have
upheld
that
kind
of
a
result.
certainly,
it’s
true
that,
early
on,
a
forfeiture
of
one
who
had
entrusted
his
property
to
one
who
then
committed
a
crime
was
justified
on
the
ground,
in
which
this
court
has
regarded
as
fictional,
that
the
property
was
the
offender.
now,
i
think
though
that
there’s
some
significant
justification
in
terms
of
current
realities
that
are
very
closely
related
to
that
fiction,
that
is,
if
that
the
state
needs
to
be
able
to
attack
in
effect
the
capital
goods
of
crime.
in
a
smuggling
operation,
for
example,
the
airplane,
the
vessel,
or
the
truck
or
whatever
may
it
be
far
more
important
and
the
individual
driving
it.
and,
if
--
and
it’s
an
effective
tool
to
be
able
to
reach
that
vehicle.
now,
there’s
hardly
any
vehicle
in
the
united
states
that
is
not
subject
to
some
outstanding
security
interest.
if
the
state
--
if
forfeiture
of
this
vessel
can
be
defeated
by
undisclosed
outstanding
security
interest,
then
i
think
that
the
forfeiture
statute’s
effectiveness
would
be
seriously
impaired.
the
people
in
the
position
of
pearson
have
ample
opportunity
to
protect
themselves.
they
anticipated
the
risk
of
forfeiture.
they
provided
for
insurance.
they
provided
for
continuance
of
the
lease
payment
and
it
is
not
unfair
nor,
in
my
opinion,
does
it
violate
the
constitutional
requirements
that
their
property
be
taken.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
the
statue
does
provide
for
bond.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
yes,
they
could.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
true.
well,
that’s
on
page
19
of
the
appendix
accompanying
--
that’s
right.
it
is
on
that
particular
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
true.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
right.
i
don’t
have
an
explanation.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
one
or
two
things,
your
honor.
the
perspective
or
one
of
the
last
things
that
counsel
for
appellees
just
stated
that
acquittal
of
one
charged
with
a
crime
would
have
not
all
the
effect
on
this
forfeiture.
i
don’t
think
that’s
reflected
in
this
record
at
all
and
i’m
not
sure
that’s
a
correct
statement
of
the
law.
i
just
don’t
think
that
that’s
a
--
that
issue
is
presented
with
this
case
at
all.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’d
be
my
view
of
the
law,
your
honor.
and,
i
think
that
the
courts
here
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
well,
it
is
predicated
on
their
being
a
controlled
substance,
in
effect,
used
in
violation
of
the
law
on
a
particular
vessel.
now
it
seems
to
me,
if
there’s
a
determination
that
the
one
that
controls
the
substance
or
the
one
who
owned
this
vessel
or
any
of
the
things
which
would
then
themselves
vitiate
a
conviction,
now
that
would
of
necessity
defeat
the
forfeiture.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
no,
it
certainly
doesn’t--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
the
statute
reads
that
way,
your
honor.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
think
that
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
think
that
could
be
certainly
the
case,
your
honor.
now,
i
would
only
make
one
other
point.
appellees
have
suggested
that
what
we
are
contending
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
probable
cause
requirement
applies
to
seizure
and
then
they
go
from
that
to
say
that
“well,
you
should
have
a
warrant.”
your
honor,
that
is
a
misstatement
of
our
contention.
we
say
that
the
statute
here,
the
way
it
operates,
has
built
into
it
protections
which
are
very
similar
to
a
determination
of
probable
cause.
if
probable
cause
is
required,
we
think
that
the
statute
and
the
way
it
was
complied
with
satisfies
it,
but
we
do
not
think
that
there’s
any
question
of
a
warrant
being
acquired,
something
over
and
above
what
the
statute
requires.
and
this
court’s
decision
in
cooper
versus
california
which
was
cited
with
approval
in
this
past
term’s
decision
in
cady
versus
dombrowski,
i
think,
makes
that
crystal
clear.
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
why
can
making
the
property
of
one
who’s
innocent
of
a
crime
be
helpful
in
law
enforcement,
i
think
that
it’s
self-evident.
this
court
in
the
goldsmith
case
which
has
not
been
overruled
said
that
the
theory
of
the
law
is
you
interpose
the
care
of
the
person
who
entrusts
his
property
in
aid
and
law
of
law
enforcement,
particularly
when
you’re
talking
about
people
who
are
selling
property
or
lending
money.
they
have
the
ability
to
protect
themselves
against
that
risk
and
then
if
that
risk
is
there,
they
also
have
the
motive
to
try
to
see
that
their
property
is
not
used
in
violation
of
the
law.
that
is
a
justification
for
this.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
think
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
think
so,
your
honor.
but,
that
is
not
the
only
justification
for
the
statutes
and
the
only
justification
for
forfeiture,
i
think
that
forfeiture
would
be
amply
justified
in
the
case
of
that
kind
because
it’s
evident
that
someone
had
seriously
violated
the
law
and
that
that
vessel
had
been
used
in
that
violation.
it
wouldn’t
offend
due
process
to
take
the
vessel.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
think
that
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
yes,
i
think
it’s
an
instance
where
fiction
may
bear
a
close
resemblance
to
reality,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
lynn
coleman.
i
appear
as
special
counsel
for
the
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico,
both
of
the
appellants
in
this
case
being
officials
of
the
commonwealth.
this
is
an
appeal
from
a
decision
by
the
district
court
of
puerto
rico
sitting
as
a
three-judge
court
which
declared
unconstitutional
a
portion
of
the
controlled
substances
act
of
the
commonwealth
as
well
as
the
uniform
seizure
and
forfeiture
statute
of
the
commonwealth.
the
ground
for
this
decision
was
that
these
provisions
were
unconstitutional
on
their
face
in
that
they
fail
to
provide
for
notice
and
an
opportunity
for
hearing
prior
to
a
seizure
in
connection
with
a
forfeiture
proceeding
and
that,
from
a
substantive
standpoint,
they
provided
for
the
taking
of
the
property
of
a
person
who
was
innocent
of
the
crime
for
which
the
property
was
seized
and
the
court
in
so
holding
rely
them
to
fairly
recent
decisions
of
this
case
of
this
case
--
this
court,
fuentes
versus
shevin,
and
coin
and
currency.
the
particular
brief
statement
of
the
facts
involved
would
be
that
pearson
yacht
leasing
company
leased
a
yacht
to
a
man
named
olson
which,
in
our
brief,
we
referred
to
as
the
lessee.
the
lease
is,
in
many
respects,
familiar
to
--
similar
to
a
conditional
sale
in
that
the
lessee
would
enjoy
full
possession
of
the
vessel.
the
lease
was
for
a
five-year
term.
the
lessee
had
the
obligation
to
pay
rent,
that
obligation
would
not
cease
in
the
event
anything
happened
to
the
boat
specifically
indicating
that
forfeiture
would
be
one
of
the
events
which
would
not
interrupt
the
lessee’s
obligation
to
pay
rent.
the
lessee
had
to
insure
the
interest
of
the
lessor
against
all
eventualities.
the
lessee
was
obliged
to
use
the
boat
only
for
lawful
purposes
and
alike.
it
contained
provisions
which
you
would
expect
to
find
in
a
conditional
sale
contract
or
in
a
conventional
mortgage
if
the
seller
of
products
had
elected
to
allow
his
vendee
to
take
title
and,
instead,
reserve
a
purely
security
interest.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
don’t
know
that
it
would
have
in
this
case,
your
honor.
the
court
below
treated
the
lessor
as
if
he
were
the
owner
of
the
vessel
and
really
did
not
examine
the
kind
of
a
case
which
you
would
have
where
you
have
parties,
both
of
them
have
some
interest
in
the
vessel.
i
think
that
the
effect
of
the
puerto
rican
statute
and
many
other
statutes,
both
of
the
united
states
and
other
states,
could
be
to
--
in
a
forfeiture
proceeding,
to
forfeit
effectively
the
interest
of
the
mortgagor.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
yes,
$1
after
the
end
of
5
years.
that’s
true.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
think
that’s
true.
in
any
event,
the
lessee
was
found
in
possession
of
marijuana.
presumably,
he
was
arrested
in
criminal
proceedings
instituted
against
him.
some
time
after
that
discovery
of
marijuana
on
the
vessel,
it
was
seized
pursuant
to
the
statute.
the
statute
operates
in
this
way.
there
must
be
a
determination
by
a
high
governmental
official,
either
the
superintendent
of
police
for
the
entire
island,
the
attorney
general
of
the
department
or
the
secretary
of
treasury
in
puerto
rico
that
there
has
been
an
offense
for
which
the
property
becomes
forfeitable.
the
offense
is
described
in
the
controlled
substances
act.
process
is
issued
by
such
officer
and
pursuant
to
that,
the
vessel
is
seized
without
notice.
within
15
days
--
i
mean,
immediately
notice
is
to
be
given,
within
--
and
the
--
it’s
to
be
given
to
all
owners,
all
persons
who
are
known
to
have
an
interest,
within
15
days,
they
can
challenge
the
seizure
and
forfeiture
by
instituting
proceedings
in
the
commonwealth
courts.
the
lessee
was
notified.
he
was
on
record
with
the
puerto
rican
authorities
as
the
owner
of
the
boat.
the
puerto
rican
authorities
presumably
had
no
knowledge
of
the
lessor’s
interest.
the
lessor
consequently
was
not
notified.
he
did
not
discover
the
seizure
and
forfeiture
of
the
vessel
until
some
months
later
when
it
elected
to
sue
in
federal
court
rather
than
in
the
commonwealth
courts
pursuant
to
the
statute.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
believe
so.
i
think
the
--
that
registration
statute,
the
form
which
there
is
registration,
provides
for
other
owners.
the
record
is
really
silent
on
that
though,
your
honor.
before
proceeding
to
the
burden
of
my
argument,
i
would
like
to
mention
one
thing.
the
solicitor
general
filed
a
brief
in
this
case,
which
i
think
is
very
excellent
help
for
brief
this
past
friday.
it
particularly
places
in
perspective
the
impact
of
an
affirmance
of
this
decision
on
a
number
of
federal
laws.
there
is
one
thing
that
we
--
i
would
call
attention
to.
on
page
5
of
the
solicitor’s
brief
in
a
footnote,
it
is
stated
that
the
statutes
involved
were
challenged
as
violating
both
the
fifth
and
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
below,
in
its
holding,
made
no
distinction
whatsoever.
they
based
it
on
due
process
of
law
and
a
concept
of
taking
without
just
compensation
without
specifying
either
the
fifth
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
solicitor
then
says
it
has
been
held
that,
to
the
extent
the
constitution
applies
directly
to
the
laws
of
puerto
rico,
they
are
subject
to
the
fifth
amendment.
a
1947
decision
of
the
first
circuit
is
cited.
that
case
does
hold
then
that
that,
of
course,
was
before
the
commonwealth
was
created
in
1952.
we
suggest
that
that
makes
a
substantial
difference.
since
the
creation
of
the
commonwealth,
the
first
circuit
has
consistently
declined
to
decide
that
question
as
to
whether
the
fifth
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
applicable.
so
has
this
court
in
the
only
other
case
to
come
directly
from
the
commonwealth
to
this
court,
that
being
the
fornaris
case
which
was
decided
about
three
years
ago.
the
commonwealth
did
not
brief
this
question.
we
do
not
regard
as
essential
to
a
determination
in
this
case
whether
the
fifth
or
the
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
is
applicable
to
the
commonwealth.
it
has
been
true
and
accepted
for
many
years
that
due
process
fully
applies
in
the
commonwealth.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i’m
not
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
well,
there
could
--
there
can
be,
i
think,
a
respectable
analysis
made
that
it
is
before
the
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
yes.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
yes.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
well,
i
would
not
attempt
to
argue
it
now,
your
honor.
if
this
subject
were
to
be
gone
into,
we
would
ask
leave
to
file
a
supplemental
brief.
i
think
it’s
very
complicated.
there
are
also
problems
with
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
your
honor
has
put
his
finger
on
the
point.
the
question
is,
is
it
a
territory?
the
--
when
the
commonwealth
was
created,
it
is
the
view
generally,
i
think,
of
the
commonwealth
that
it
is
not
longer
a
territory.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
well,
i
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
don’t
think
that
that
would
be
can
absolutely
agreed
to,
your
honor.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
what
i’m
suggesting
merely
is
that
a
proper
determination
of
that
issue
would
involve
a
very
detailed
analysis
of
the
creation
of
the
commonwealth.
it
would
have
implications
far
beyond
this
case
where
those
implications
are
not
now
before
the
court.
it
does
not
appear
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
well,
it
is
certainly
not
a
state
of
the
union
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
but
as
to
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
well,
i
would
not
attempt
to
go
into
that
this
time.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
would
assume
that
it
would,
your
honor.
but,
i
don’t
know
that
it’s
necessary
to
decide
which.
it’s
been
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
don’t
believe
you
do.[laughter]
i
just
wanted
to
clarify
that
since
the
solicitor
had
made
the
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
exactly
right.
i’ve
hardly
clarified
it
here.
we
submit
that
the
court
below’s
holding
that
notice
and
hearing
prior
to
seizure
are
constitutionally
necessary
by
way
of
this
court’s
decision
in
fuentes
v.
shevin
was
wrong.
we
think
that
that
is
an
unauthorized
extension
and
undue
extension
of
a
holding.
first
of
all,
there’s
a
serious
question
whether
pearson
could
have
standing
to
complain
of
seizure
to
assert
that
they
were
constitutionally
entitled
to
notice
and
hearing,
assuming
such
a
requirement
were
to
exist
because
pearson
had
no
possessory
interest
in
this
yacht.
the
yacht
was
in
the
possession
of
the
lessee
pursuant
to
the
lease.
under
puerto
rican
law,
there
is
no
change
of
title
in
a
forfeiture
proceeding
until
a
forfeiture
occurs
through
the
yacht’s
temporarily
in
possession
of
the
commonwealth.
we
do
not
see
that
that
seizure
itself
affected
the
rights
of
the
lessor.
and
so,
i
would
think
there’s
a
serious
question
of
standing
initially
on
the
merits.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
nor
did
forfeiture,
your
honor.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
true.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
right.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
true.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
of
course,
there’s
a
question.
it
stipulated
that
he
was
never
note
that
--
the
lessor
was
never
notified
pursuant
to
the
statute.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
he
obtained
actual
notice.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
no,
no.
but,
the
puerto
rican
courts
have
said
the
15
days
doesn’t
run
until
the
person
involved
was
actually
notified.
so
now,
if
notice
pursuant
to
the
statute
is
required,
then
he
haven’t
been
notified
yet.
if
actual
notice
would’ve
sufficed,
15
--
after
he
found
out
about
it,
more
than
15
days
elapsed
before
he
decided
to
go
to
federal
court.
we
argue
in
our
brief
that
he
really
is
not
entitled
to
complain
of
forfeiture
either
for
that
reason,
that
he
forwent
the
rights
that
the
puerto
rican
statute
confers
upon
him.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
until
there’s
notice.
whether
actual
notice
will
suffice,
i’m
not
sure,
but
it
may
be
that
only
notice
by
the
--
formal
notice
by
the
commonwealth
pursuant
to
the
statute
will
suffice.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
exactly
right.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
yes.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
they
would
be
restricted
to
arguing
that
either
the
crime
was
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
there
wasn’t
any
marijuana
or
something
of
that
nature,
that’s
true.
we,
at
another
point
of
our
brief,
make
the
point
that,
in
our
view,
the
puerto
rican
supreme
court
would’ve
been
quite
free
to
reconsider
a
1967
holding
that
the
statute
would
allow
the
forfeiture
of
the
property
of
an
innocent
person.
and,
that
in
light
of
the
very
strong
tradition
in
this
court
of
giving
deference
to
state
court
determinations,
and
there’s
a
particular
line
of
cases
with
respect
to
the
commonwealth
where
it
appears
that
an
extra
major
deference
might
be
justified.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
they
have
the
option
of
selling
them
or
retaining
them.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
think,
normally,
they
sell
them.
i’m
not
advised
of
it.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
actually,
the
retained
it
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
in
other
words
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
no.
it’s
been
retained,
your
honor,
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
for
official
use.
it’s
a
sailboat.
it
wouldn’t
be
very
usable
by
an
official.
they
have
not
elected
yet
to
sell
it.
there’s
no
time
limit
in
the
statue
on
when
they
have
to
make
the
election.
to
go
to
fuentes
versus
shevin,
in
that
case
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
exactly
right.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
why
the
case
is
very
important
to
the
commonwealth.
the
uniform
seizure
and
forfeiture
statute
brought
together
all
of
the
seizure
and
forfeiture
provisions
in
disparate
parts
of
puerto
rican
code.
and
declaring
this
statute,
on
its
face,
unconstitutional
just
puts
an
end
to
seizure
and
forfeiture
proceedings,
i
think,
is
a
practical
matter
in
puerto
rico.
if
you
have
to
have
notice
before
you
can
seize
property,
in
connection
with
a
criminal
matter
in
leading
to
a
forfeiture
proceeding,
the
seizure
statutes,
i
believe,
are
going
to
be
--
have
their
practicality
seriously
impaired.
but,
in
fuentes
versus
shevin,
this
court
struck
down
the
pennsylvania
in
florida
prejudgment
replevin
statutes,
a
ground
that
they
authorized
the
taking
of
property,
even
though
for
a
short
period
of
time,
without
opportunity
for
notice
and
hearing.
there,
the
creditor
could
invoke
process
of
the
state
to
retrieve
property
in
the
possession
of
another
private
person
solely
on
the
basis
of
his
own
affidavit,
solely
on
the
basis
of
an
ex
parte
proceeding
before
the
clerk
of
the
court.
the
court
carefully
distinguished
other
situations
where
seizure
without
a
prior
hearing
was
justifiable.
it
also
carefully
distinguished
seizure
pursuant
to
a
warrant.
in
our
view,
seizure
under
this
statute
where
there
must
be
a
determination
by
a
responsible
official,
where
there
must
be
processed
issue
is
very
similar
to
seizure
under
a
warrant,
though
not
the
same
thing.
and,
in
fuentes,
the
court
identified
three
criteria
which
have
generally
been
used
to
describe
those
areas
where
there
could
be
seizure
in
advance
of
a
hearing
and
that
is,
is
there
an
important
governmental
interest
served,
was
the
first
criteria
and
i
think
that,
clearly
is
satisfied
by
seizure
statute
looking
to
a
forfeiture.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
the
record
does
not
disclose
that,
your
honor.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
don’t
think
so.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
no.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
believe
so.
it’s
stipulated
by
both
parties
that
the
officials
acted
in
punctilious
compliance
with
the
statute.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
yes.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
not
on
this
record.
the
second
criteria
identified
in
fuentes
versus
shevin,
as
justifying
seizure
without
a
hearing,
was
the
need
for
promptness,
i
think
that
obviously
applies
to
a
seizure
proceeding.
the
third
was
that
there’d
be
no
abdication
of
state
power.
in
fuentes,
state
power
could
be
invoked
solely
by
private
persons
for
private
gain
without
any
determination
whatsoever
of
a
--
is
probably
correct.
here,
however,
there
is
a
determination
by
a
high
government
official
that
an
offense
has
been
committed.
the
property
has
been
used
in
connection
with
a
crime
and
the
process
must
be
issued.
we
think
that
this
case
is
clearly
within
the
guidelines
expressed
by
fuentes
which
would
justify
a
seizure
without
prior
hearing.
we
think
this
case
--
this
court’s
decision
in
1971
in
u.s.
versus
thirty-seven
photographs
would
also
clearly
justify
a
seizure
prior
to
hearing
in
connection
with
a
forfeiture
proceeding.
so,
our
conclusion
is
that
that
part
of
the
court’s
decision
was
clearly
an
error.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
no,
no,
no.
i
think
a
hearing
--
i
mean,
a
hearing
is
provided
by
statute
and
a
hearing
is
provided
before
forfeiture.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
and
i
think
there’s
provision
that
the
hearing
be
very
prompt
following
up
on
the
seizure.
i
think
that
satisfies
the
constitutional
requirements.
with
respect
to
the
court’s
holding
that
this
court’s
decision
in
coin
and
currency
is
to
the
effect
that
the
forfeiture
provisions
of
the
puerto
rican
law
must,
in
necessity,
be
unconstitutional
because
they
authorize
the
taking
of
a
person’s
property
if
he
was
innocent
of
the
crime
for
which
the
property
was
--
or
at
least
we
think
that
is
clearly
an
error
as
well.
first,
as
i
mentioned
a
moment
ago,
there
is
again
a
standing
question
because
pearson
elected
not
to
avail
himself
of
the
opportunity
presented
by
the
puerto
rican
law
to
within
15
days
of
notice,
be
that
pursuant
to
the
statute
or
after
actual
notice,
to
go
to
court
and
assert
his
rights.
we
also
believe
that
if
they
think
that
it
was
crucial
to
their
rights
that
they’d
be
able
to
show
that
they
were
innocent
of
the
crime
and
that
that
defeat
the
forfeiture,
that
that
would
be
a
question
which
certainly
could
be
litigated
in
the
puerto
rican
courts.
the
statute
does
not
say
you
can
take
the
property
of
one
innocent
of
the
crime,
the
statute
is
silent
on
that.
it
is
presumed
that
that
is
permitted
under
the
statute.
however,
there
had
been
two
other
exceptions
recognized
to
the
statute
for
which
there
is
no
authority
in
the
statute
itself.
those
are,
if
the
property
were
a
common
carrier
or
if
the
property
were
stolen
from
the
lawful
owner.
those
are
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
the
puerto
rican
supreme
court
enact
in
1967
and
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
in
this
court,
the
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i’m
sorry.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
right
and
on
the
strength
of
that
decision,
your
honor,
this
court
said
that
there
was
no
other
way
to
construe
the
statute.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
no,
but
my
primary
argument
of
course,
your
honor,
it
would
be
a
wrong
construction
should
the
court
view
the
constitutional
requirements
as
being
such,
that
this
defense
must
be
permitted.
i
think
that
there
is
that,
under
the
principles
of
construing
a
statute
to
preserve
its
constitutionality
they
would’ve
been
required
to
take
a
look
at
the
statue
and
they
wouldn’t
of
necessity
have
to
abide
by
that
construction.
there
was
an
argument
earlier
in
this
case
that
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
to
allow
the
court,
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico,
to
past
first
of
the
question.
the
commonwealth
withdrew
its
objection
to
the
calling
of
the
three-judge
court.
we
are
not
here
arguing
that
abstention
was
required,
but
i
think
that
there
was
a
duty
on
the
court
to
attempt
to
save
constitutionality
of
the
statute
if
it
thought
it
necessary.
but,
on
the
merits
of
the
coin
and
currency
question,
we
do
not
think
that
coin
and
currency
reached
this
question
at
all.
justice
harlan
there
did
say
that
there
could
be
a
question
under
fifth
amendment
whether
a
statute
authorizing
the
taking
of
one
innocent
of
the
crime
could
be
squared
constitutionally.
he
said
it
is
not
necessary
to
decide
that
question.
there
was
specifically
no
overruling
of
the
many
decisions
of
this
court
which
in
the
past
have
upheld
that
kind
of
a
result.
certainly,
it’s
true
that,
early
on,
a
forfeiture
of
one
who
had
entrusted
his
property
to
one
who
then
committed
a
crime
was
justified
on
the
ground,
in
which
this
court
has
regarded
as
fictional,
that
the
property
was
the
offender.
now,
i
think
though
that
there’s
some
significant
justification
in
terms
of
current
realities
that
are
very
closely
related
to
that
fiction,
that
is,
if
that
the
state
needs
to
be
able
to
attack
in
effect
the
capital
goods
of
crime.
in
a
smuggling
operation,
for
example,
the
airplane,
the
vessel,
or
the
truck
or
whatever
may
it
be
far
more
important
and
the
individual
driving
it.
and,
if
--
and
it’s
an
effective
tool
to
be
able
to
reach
that
vehicle.
now,
there’s
hardly
any
vehicle
in
the
united
states
that
is
not
subject
to
some
outstanding
security
interest.
if
the
state
--
if
forfeiture
of
this
vessel
can
be
defeated
by
undisclosed
outstanding
security
interest,
then
i
think
that
the
forfeiture
statute’s
effectiveness
would
be
seriously
impaired.
the
people
in
the
position
of
pearson
have
ample
opportunity
to
protect
themselves.
they
anticipated
the
risk
of
forfeiture.
they
provided
for
insurance.
they
provided
for
continuance
of
the
lease
payment
and
it
is
not
unfair
nor,
in
my
opinion,
does
it
violate
the
constitutional
requirements
that
their
property
be
taken.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
the
statue
does
provide
for
bond.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
yes,
they
could.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
true.
well,
that’s
on
page
19
of
the
appendix
accompanying
--
that’s
right.
it
is
on
that
particular
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
true.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’s
right.
i
don’t
have
an
explanation.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
one
or
two
things,
your
honor.
the
perspective
or
one
of
the
last
things
that
counsel
for
appellees
just
stated
that
acquittal
of
one
charged
with
a
crime
would
have
not
all
the
effect
on
this
forfeiture.
i
don’t
think
that’s
reflected
in
this
record
at
all
and
i’m
not
sure
that’s
a
correct
statement
of
the
law.
i
just
don’t
think
that
that’s
a
--
that
issue
is
presented
with
this
case
at
all.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
that’d
be
my
view
of
the
law,
your
honor.
and,
i
think
that
the
courts
here
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
well,
it
is
predicated
on
their
being
a
controlled
substance,
in
effect,
used
in
violation
of
the
law
on
a
particular
vessel.
now
it
seems
to
me,
if
there’s
a
determination
that
the
one
that
controls
the
substance
or
the
one
who
owned
this
vessel
or
any
of
the
things
which
would
then
themselves
vitiate
a
conviction,
now
that
would
of
necessity
defeat
the
forfeiture.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
no,
it
certainly
doesn’t--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
the
statute
reads
that
way,
your
honor.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
think
that
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
think
that
could
be
certainly
the
case,
your
honor.
now,
i
would
only
make
one
other
point.
appellees
have
suggested
that
what
we
are
contending
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
probable
cause
requirement
applies
to
seizure
and
then
they
go
from
that
to
say
that
“well,
you
should
have
a
warrant.”
your
honor,
that
is
a
misstatement
of
our
contention.
we
say
that
the
statute
here,
the
way
it
operates,
has
built
into
it
protections
which
are
very
similar
to
a
determination
of
probable
cause.
if
probable
cause
is
required,
we
think
that
the
statute
and
the
way
it
was
complied
with
satisfies
it,
but
we
do
not
think
that
there’s
any
question
of
a
warrant
being
acquired,
something
over
and
above
what
the
statute
requires.
and
this
court’s
decision
in
cooper
versus
california
which
was
cited
with
approval
in
this
past
term’s
decision
in
cady
versus
dombrowski,
i
think,
makes
that
crystal
clear.
with
respect
to
the
argument
that
why
can
making
the
property
of
one
who’s
innocent
of
a
crime
be
helpful
in
law
enforcement,
i
think
that
it’s
self-evident.
this
court
in
the
goldsmith
case
which
has
not
been
overruled
said
that
the
theory
of
the
law
is
you
interpose
the
care
of
the
person
who
entrusts
his
property
in
aid
and
law
of
law
enforcement,
particularly
when
you’re
talking
about
people
who
are
selling
property
or
lending
money.
they
have
the
ability
to
protect
themselves
against
that
risk
and
then
if
that
risk
is
there,
they
also
have
the
motive
to
try
to
see
that
their
property
is
not
used
in
violation
of
the
law.
that
is
a
justification
for
this.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
think
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
think
so,
your
honor.
but,
that
is
not
the
only
justification
for
the
statutes
and
the
only
justification
for
forfeiture,
i
think
that
forfeiture
would
be
amply
justified
in
the
case
of
that
kind
because
it’s
evident
that
someone
had
seriously
violated
the
law
and
that
that
vessel
had
been
used
in
that
violation.
it
wouldn’t
offend
due
process
to
take
the
vessel.
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
i
think
that
--
mr.
lynn
r.
coleman
yes,
i
think
it’s
an
instance
where
fiction
may
bear
a
close
resemblance
to
reality,
your
honor.
thank
you.
