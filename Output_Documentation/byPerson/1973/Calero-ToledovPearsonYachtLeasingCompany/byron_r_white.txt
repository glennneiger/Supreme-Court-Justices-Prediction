justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
it
have
to
be
one
of
the
other
in
order
to
sustain
jurisdiction
of
this
court
to
review
judgments
of
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
so
we
don’t
really
care
which
it
is
right
now,
do
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
haven’t.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
had
a
hearing
for
forfeiture
or
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
for
forfeiture?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
wasn’t
any
marijuana?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
the
puerto
rican
government
do
to
forfeited
vessels?
do
they
sell
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
they
normally
just
sell
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
this
vessel
just
stopped
and
boarded?
is
that
the
way
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
any
intention
made
that
the
officials
had
no
right
to
go
on
the
vessel
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
is
it
challenged
that
there
was
marijuana
found
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
are
we
to
assume
that
the
vessel
was
properly
boarded
and
marijuana
was
found
in
judging
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
parties
were
arrested?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
challenge
to
their
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
--
you
don’t
suggest
a
hearing
--
that
no
hearing
at
all
was
required?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
lower
court
construed
it
as
authorizing
the
taking
of
an
innocent
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then,
in
this
case--
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
we
about
to
disagree
with
him?
are
you
suggesting
we
disagree
with
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there
was
an
illegal
arrest
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
would
have
to
claim
that
was
illegal
to
make
your
present
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand,
but
it
was
after,
as
i
understand
it,
marijuana
was
found
on
the
vessel
in
possession
of
those
in
charge
of
the
vessel.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
was
--
in
those
circumstances,
do
you
think
there
would
have
to
be
a
prior
determination
by
a
magistrate
before
an
arrest
could
be
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
we’ve
just
given
you
the
circumstances?
justice
byron

white
yes.
