could
it?

william
j.
brennan,

what
is
it?
is
puerto
rico
a
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
it
treats
--
we
treat
it
like
a
state
court
on
other
purposes?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
treat
judgments
of
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico,
i’m
sure
that’s
what
we
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
treat
judgments
of
the
states,
but
can
anyone
really
argue
that
puerto
rico
is
a
state?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
you
have
to
if
the
fifth
applies?
it’s
a
territory,
for
the
purpose
of
the
constitution,
and
not
a
state.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
it’s
purely
a
congressional
commonwealth,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
just
the
way
that
that
was
given.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
that.
i’ve
been
in
puerto
rico.
i
know
some
controversy
about
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
still,
for
the
life
of
me,
can’t
see
how
it
could
ever
be
a
fake
one
when
it’s
not
been
admitted
to
the
union.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
certainly
isn’t.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don’t
see
how
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
applies
only
the
states
of
the
union
apply
to
commonwealth
of
puerto
rico?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
obtain
this
one
for
personal
use
of
officials
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
didn’t
i
read
somewhere
that
officials
are
making
use
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
didn’t
get
to
that.

justice
william

and
what’s
the
word?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see
that.
right,
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
must
require
a
conviction?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
all
it
requires
is
proof
that
the
substance
were
there
whether
or
not
there
is
any
prosecution,
isn’t
that
it,
under
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

one
way
up,
i
mean,
that’s
where
you
would’ve
taken
it.

in
the
second
case,
calero-toledo,
a
three-judge
federal
district
court
held
unconstitutional
puerto
rican
forfeiture
statutes,
as
applied
in
this
case.
a
yacht,
owned
by
the
appellee,
was
seized
and
fortified
by
puerto
rican
authorities
when
drugs
were
discovered
aboard
the
yacht
when
located
in
puerto
rican
waters.
the
authorities
gave
no
prior
notice
of
their
intent
to
seize
the
yacht
and
appellee,
the
lessor,
was
innocent
of
any
knowledge
of
the
lessee’s
wrongful
use
of
it.
the
three-judge
court
held
that
the
statute’s
failure
to
provide
for
pre-seizure
notice
rendered
them
unconstitutional
for
lack
of
procedural
due
process
and
further
held
that
it
is
applied
in
forfeit
the
interest
of
the
lessor,
innocent
of
knowledge
of
wrongful
use,
the
statute
is
unconstitutionally
deprived
an
innocent
party
of
property
without
just
compensation.
we
disagree,
and
for
reasons
expressed
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
reverse.

for

the

of
