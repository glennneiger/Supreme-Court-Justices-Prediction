e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
73-157,
calero-toledo
against
pearson
yacht
leasing
company.
mr.
coleman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting,
mr.
coleman,
that
if
there
were
a
mortgage
--
if
there’d
been
a
full
transfer
and
a
mortgage
back,
that
is
the
title
had
passed
and
the
mortgage
back,
that
this
forfeiture
would
then
wipe
out
the
underlying
security?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
want
to
clarify
the
existence
of
the
problem
rather
than
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
this
case
in
its
present
posture
would
be
the
same
if
they
--
whether
they
found
marijuana,
heroin,
or
machine
guns
that
were
being
run
to
or
from
cuba
or
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
whatever?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
suppose
they
could’ve
required
a
bond
of
some
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
addition
to
what
they
have
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gelpi.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
which
document?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
a
forfeiture
takes
place?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
to
be
more
specific,
suppose
at
the
forfeiture
hearing,
the
person
came
in
and
showed
by
the
testimony
of
expert
chemists
that
the
substance
found
was
ground
soybeans
and
not
marijuana.
do
you
--
are
you
suggesting
that
that
would
not
be
--
defeat
the
forfeiture?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
the
arrest
or
the
seizure,
the
original
seizure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you’re
not
challenging
the
arrest,
that’s
clear?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
as
another
alternative,
that
the
boat
won’t
be
there
when
they
come?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
i
think
not.
thank
you,
mr.
gelpi.
mr.
coleman,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
since
the
forfeiture
is
predicated
on
the
illegal
acts,
it
should
reasonably
follow
that
if
no
illegal
act
is
found
and
determined,
there
couldn’t
be
any
foundation
for
the
forfeiture.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose,
mr.
coleman,
that
it
has
happened
that
a
vessel
on
--
with
no
one
on
board
at
all
may
have
been
found
with
machine
guns,
heroin,
or
other
contraband
seized
and
forfeited
and
there
would
be
no
verdict
of
guilt
of
any
person
unless
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
unless
they
could
show
that
the
owner
in
some
way
was
involved
in
the
conspiracy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
the
vessel
was
the
instrument
of
the
crime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
was
no
proof
of
who
navigated
the
vessel?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
