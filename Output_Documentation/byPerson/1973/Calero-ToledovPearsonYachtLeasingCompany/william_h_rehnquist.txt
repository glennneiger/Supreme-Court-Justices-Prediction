justice
william

isn’t
it
right,
mr.
coleman,
in
this
case,
the
lessee
could
buy
the
thing
for
a
dollar
at
the
end
of
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it’s
virtually
indistinguishable
from
a
conditional
sale?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
the
puerto
rican
statute,
could
someone
having
a
property
interest
in
the
vessel
who
was
not
in
possession
of
it
have
registered
under
this
puerto
rican
statute
and
then
been
notified
at
the
time
of
the
forfeiture?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
referring
to
the
lease,
you
say
that
the
seizure
as
opposed
to
the
forfeiture
didn’t
impair
the
lessee’s
obligation
to
pay
rent
to
the
lessor,
so
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
one
takes
the
strictest
possible
view
of
the
puerto
rican
forfeiture
statute,
that
is,
that
it
forfeits
the
interest
of
a
totally
innocent
owner
upon
compliance
with
a
statutory.
what
substantive
arguments
could
a
person
in
pearson’s
position
make
at
this
hearing?
justice
william

rehnquist
mr.
gelpi,
at
page
34
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
of
your
opponent,
section
1722
of
the
lpra
is
set
out
under
section
a
there.
it
talks
about
how
the
hearing
shall
be
conducted
and
says
towards
the
end
of
section
a,
all
questions
that
may
be
arise,
and
i
understand
to
be
to
be
talking
about
this
challenge,
shall
be
decided
and
all
other
proceedings
shall
be
conducted
as
in
an
ordinary
civil
action.
and
then,
it
talks
about
appeal
to
the
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
puerto
rico
on
questions
of
law.
that
sounds
to
me
as
if
it
is
contemplated
that
factual
questions
can
be
raised
in
this
proceeding.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what’s
the
point
of
providing
for
a
hearing
and
adjudication
of
facts
if
the
adjudication
doesn’t
have
some
effect
on
the
proceeding?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
is
desired
to
seize
contraband,
wouldn’t
there
almost
always
be
exigent
circumstances
as
to
the
seizure
as
opposed
to
the
forfeiture?
i
mean,
you’re
not
going
to
get
any
contraband
if
you
notify
the
people
that
in
two
days
you’re
coming
aboard
to
seize
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
in
the
fifth,
it’s
permissible
to
have
a
statute
that
says
a
boat
on
which
contraband
is
found
shall
itself
be
forfeited.
then,
presumably
one
of
the
elements
that
the
government
has
got
to
show
is
that
the
contraband
was
found
on
the
boat.
now,
if
they
notify
the
lessee
that,
in
48
hours,
they’re
coming
aboard
to
see
if
there’s
any
contraband
on
his
boat,
the
result
of
that
48-hour
search
is
pretty
well
foreordained,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
might
you
not
find
a
situation
where
there
was
controlled
substance
of
a
vessel,
but
no
sufficient
evidence
to
say
that
any
one
given
individual
was
in
possession
of
the
controlled
substance?

h.
rehnquist
