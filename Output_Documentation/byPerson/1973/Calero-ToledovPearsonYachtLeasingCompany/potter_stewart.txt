justice

stewart
you
say
that
during
the
term
of
the
lease
the
lessor
wasn’t
entitled
to
possession
anyway
so
that
the
change
of
possession
didn’t

him
at

justice

stewart
well,
as
i
understand
it,
he
had
an
opportunity
if
he’d
been
given
notice
in
15
days,
there
was
a
15-day
limitation.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice

stewart
within

justice
potter
stewart
do
you
say
that
it
has
been
judicially
determined
that
that
15
day-period
doesn’t
begin
to
run
until
there’s
actual
notice?
justice

now
if
that’s
true,
the

hasn’t

wouldn’t
it,
if
the
challenger
could
show
that
marijuana
was
not

discovered
on

justice
potter
stewart
well,
what’s
the
point
of
the
statute
providing
for
any
challenge
then?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
must
be
some
point
well
i
would
suppose
here
wasn’t?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
by
judicial
decision
that
a
common
carrier
or
somebody
whose
property
was
stolen
and
used
for
an
illegal
--
to
transport
contraband,
is
not
covered
by
the
statute.
that’s
by
judicial
decision,
we’ve
been
told
of
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
the
courts
of
puerto
rico,
but
the
statute
doesn’t
mention
anything
like
that.
the
statute
does,
however,
provide
for
a
challenge
to
the
confiscation
and
i
suppose
that
that
was
to
allow
the
challenger
to
show
that
marijuana,
in
fact,
had
not
been
discovered
aboard
the
vessel
or
some
such
other
ground
for
opposing
the
seizure
and
forfeiture.
now,
you’re
saying
that
there’s
not
even
--
that’s
not
even
permissible
under
puerto
rican
law?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
not

on
criminal
