now,
may
i
call
your
attention
to
paragraph
4
(a)
of
the
lease
on
page
43
of
the
jurisdictional
statement?
that
is
the
paragraph
that
provides
for
insurance
by
the
lessee
to
protect
the
lessor
against
damage,
loss,
or
destruction
of
the
equipment
for
any
cause.
was
there
insurance
which,
in
fact,
protected
the
lessor
for
this
loss?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
why
should
that
be
a
matter
of
concern
since
the
lessor
had
the
right
under
the
lease
to
demand
the
insurance?
if
he
failed
to
do
so,
would
that
not
have
been
his
responsibility?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
the
lessor
in
this
case
declare
the
lease
terminated
and
all
of
the
rent
due
and
payable,
as
is
provided
by
the
lease?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
under
the
terms
of
the
lease
the
lessor
now
has
the
legal
right
to
make
a
full
recovery
from
the
lessee,
there’s
no
doubt
about
that?
