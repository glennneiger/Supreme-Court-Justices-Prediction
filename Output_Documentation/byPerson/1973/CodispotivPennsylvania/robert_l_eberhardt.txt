mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
thank
the
court
for
the
opportunity
to
argue
this
cause
before
the
court.
i
specially,
i
too
would
like
to
first
go
into
some
of
the
factual
background
if
i
may.
the
original
contempts
in
this
case
occurred
in
1966
during
a
six
--
five
or
six
week-trial
on
prison
breach
charges
in
which
the
three
defendants
mayberry,
codispoti
and
langnes
committed,
mr.
mayberry
committed
11
contemptuous
acts
by
citation
of
the
trial
judge,
mr.
codispoti
by
citation
five
or
six
contempts
and
mr.
langnes
a
total
seven
contempts.
as
counsel
for
the
petitioner
has
stated
this
was
in
1966.
there
was
an
appeal
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
and
affirmance.
mr.
mayberry
chose
a
petition
to
this
court
and
the
final
decision
by
this
court
in
january
of
1971.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
briefs
the
relevant,
we
think
language
from
that
decision
as
directions
to
the
lower
court
and
that
language
if
i
may
quote,
the
court
states
that,
“our
conclusion
is
that
the
defendant
to
paraphrase
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
on
my
brief
it’s
on
page
4
and
5
of
the
commonwealth’s
brief.
the
court
through
mr.
justice
douglas
states,
“our
conclusion
is
that
by
reason
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding
must
be
given
a
public
trial
before
a
judge
other
than
the
one
involved
by
the
contempt
nor
citing
in
re
oliver.
in
the
present
case,
that
requirement
can
be
satisfied
only
if
the
judgment
of
contempt
is
vacated
so
that
on
remand
another
judge
not
bearing
the
sting
of
at
least
slanderous
remarks
and
having
the
impersonal
authority
of
the
law
sits
in
judgment
on
the
conduct
of
petitioner
as
shown
by
the
record.”
i
quote
that
because
it’s
very
important
to
the
actions
that
the
judge
--
the
second
judge
took
when
this
case
was
remanded
to
the
court
of
common
police
of
allegan
county.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
right
and
i
would
indicate
to
the
court
that
the
reason
i
bring
this
out
also
is
the
fact
that
this
case
arose
prior
to
many
of
decisions
that
are
argued
in
our
briefs
and
those
decisions
being
the
baldwin
decision
and
the
seale
decision
and
other
decisions
that
have
come
up
regarding
contempts.
the
trial
judge
at
the
trial
for
the
prison
breach
charges
was
acting
only
on
--
the
only
decision
that
has
come
down
from
this
court
to
have
been
the
chef
decision
and
the
trial
judge
felt
that
he
was
acting
fully
within
his
powers
in
sentencing
them
on
one
to
two
years.
now,
that
sentence
was
reversed
by
this
court,
was
vacated
and
the
used
sentence
was
imposed
by
another
judge.
now,
the
judge
vandervort
who
imposed
the
six
months
sentences
that
no
sentence
ultimately
was
longer
than
six
months
against
either
of
these
two
petitioners
relied
upon
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
i
might
add
the
seale
decision
had
not
been
decided
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing
of
these
six-month
sentences.
now,
on
remand
these
sentences
were
imposed
and
as
the
court
has
observed,
the
petitioners
again
engaged
in
the
conduct
which
i
would
personally
categorize
as
contemptuous
and
in
the
record
on
page
76
probably
the
most
violent
act
was
recorded
when
petitioner
langnes
after
being
told
by
the
trial
judge
that
he
was
holding
in
contempt
of
court
for
his
language
directed
at
the
court,
threw
a
microphone
at
the
court,
fortunately
it
did
not
hit
the
trial
judge,
but
that
indicates
somewhat
i
think
the
type
of
defendant
that
is
involved
in
this
case,
but
that
is
not
relevant.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
i
don’t
know
the
rational
of
the
trial
judge
in
this
case.
he
did
not
at
that
moment
sentence
him
for
that
act
of
throwing
a
microphone.
he
was
sentencing
him
for
a
contempt
for
his
language
directed
at
the
court.
continuing
with
the
history
of
case,
the
case
then
went
up
for
an
appeal
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
and
finally
to
this
court.
several
reasons
were
alleged
in
the
petition
for
cert,
but
this
court
limited
its
grant
of
--
to
the
petition
to
two
questions.
the
first
being
whether
or
not
these
sentences
that
were
given
to
these
petitioners
should
be
aggregated
in
order
to
determine
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
the
basis
for
this
is
that
all
of
these
offenses
are
somewhat
linked
as
single
offense.
the
commonwealth
would
point
out
some
of
the
factual
things
in
this
record
to
show
that
there
were
several
offenses
involved
here.
the
trial
as
i
indicated
did
occur
over
period
of
five
to
six
weeks,
the
contempts
occurred
on
various
times
during
that
six-week
period
and
were
not
continuous,
but
they
were
occasional
throughout
this
period.
co-defendant
mayberry
of
course
committed
the
11
acts,
but
the
petitioners
here
one
committed
six
acts,
the
other
committed
seven
acts.
they
occurred
over
a
period
of
six
weeks.
it's
the
commonwealth’s
position
in
this
matter
that
they
are
identifiable
as
separate
offenses
and
are
not
part
of
one
continuous
act
and
we
have
indicated
in
our
briefs
that
we
do
not
look
upon
the
acts
of
these
petitioners
as
judge
cummings
did
in
the
seale
case
where
the
defendant
in
that
case
based
most
of
his
contemptuous
conduct
on
the
fact
that
he
was
deprived
of
his
right
to
counsel
during
the
trial,
the
particular
counsel
that
he
wanted
and
that
all
of
the
actions
of
the
defendant
in
the
seale
case
were
premised
upon
that
fact.
here,
the
petitioners
engaged
in
several
different
acts
of
contempt
directed
toward
the
court
and
based
on
various
things
that
they
found
to
be
objectionable
during
the
trial.
i
would
point
also
to
this
court’s
prior
opinion
in
the
mayberry
case
for
a
solution
to
the
question
of
impartiality.
the
trial
judge
in
the
original
prison
breach
trial
against
whom
the
contempts
were
directed
was
found
by
this
court
to
be
not
capable
of
being
impartial
because
of
the
acts
of
the
defendant
committed
and
aimed
at
the
trial
judge.
we
have
a
proceeding
on
remand
before
another
trial
judge.
that
trial
judge
cannot
be
said
to
have
been
affected
by
the
decision,
by
the
acts
of
the
petitioners
and
although
the
transcript
of
the
mayberry
proceedings
are
not
before
this
court.
in
the
hearing
on
the
mayberry
contempts,
mr.
mayberry
being
very
knowledgeable
of
the
opinion
written
by
this
court
in
his
case
informed
the
court
after
he
had
committed
another
contemptuous
act
before
judge
vandervort
that
he
motioned
the
judge,
judge
vandervort
to
now
disqualify
himself
from
sitting
in
judgment
of
mr.
mayberry
because
he
was
now
been
the
object
of
the
scorn
of
mr.
mayberry
and
therefore
must
now
disqualify
himself
from
hearing
it.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
we
could
have
a
continuous
operation
with
knowledgeable
defendants
knowing
that
by
their
own
acts
direct
at
the
court
they
could
prejudice
the
court
in
the
eyes
of
an
appellate
court
and
require
another
hearing
and
perhaps
hearings
continuing
and
continuing
on
forever
i
would
submit.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
your
mean
factually?
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
no,
i
only
can
point
to
the
record
to
show
you
that
the
citations
presented
by
the
trial
judge
indicate
the
different
days
and
times
throughout
the
trial
that
these
occurred.
i
attempted
to
completely
read
the
original
prison
breach
transcript
but
it
--
that
goes
over
a
period
of
3000
some
pages
and
my
belief
is
that
this
a
series,
not
a
series
of
offenses
but
a
group
of
individual
offenses
that's
based
upon
the
length
of
trial,
the
periods
during
which
the
trial
continued
on
without
interruption
then
all
of
a
sudden
there
would
be
an
action
by
one
of
the
defendants.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
seale
decision
for
a
minute.
the
petitioners
base
their
argument
on
the
first
issue
presented
to
this
court
on
the
rationale
of
the
court
in
the
seale.
i
would
like
to
point
out
several
basic
fallacies
with
that
rationale.
first,
being
that
the
court
in
seale
seems
to
assume
that
the
trial
judge
is
going
to
abuse
the
contempt
power.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
opinion
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
has
given
the
power
to
summarily
sentence
a
defendant
for
a
contemptuous
acts,
direct
criminal
contemptuous
acts
that
that
trial
judge
will
abuse
that
discretion.
i
take
exception
with
that
and
would
argue
that
the
traditional
appellate
review
of
abusive
discretion
is
available
to
a
defendant
and
that
the
courts
can
find
those
abuses
and
correct
them.
i
think
it
is
very
bad
basis
for
the
decision
in
seale
that
the
trial
judge
is
assumed
to
be
subject
to
abusing
his
discretion.
as
far
as
the
second
issue
is
concerned
the
commonwealth,
first
of
all
would
take
some
exception
to
the
phrasing
of
the
issue.
the
issue
was
phrased
in
terms
of
a
substantial
term
of
imprisonment.
the
pennsylvania
contempt
statues
do
not
provide
for
a
maximum
sentence.
theoretically,
i
suppose
that
it
could
be
argued
that
the
defendant
could
subject
himself
by
contempt,
direct
criminal
contemptuous
act
to
and
unknown
sentence,
the
maximum
for
which
is
not
provided
by
statute.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
well,
the
first
trial
occurred
before
this
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
we
have
submitted
for
the
court’s
consideration
an
argument
in
our
brief
based
upon
the
rationale
in
the
case
of
jenkins
v.
delaware.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
the
rationale
there
was
that
the
miranda
decision
should
not
be
applied
to
retrials.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
that
is
true,
that
is
true
and
of
course
the
constitutional
question
of
the
right
to
jury
trial
is
an
important
question.
however,
we
would
submit
that
the
commonwealth
in
this
case
proceeded
under
the
case
law
then
existing
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
in
1966
and
that
the
trial
judge
in
sentencing
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
i
don’t
know
what
went
through
its
mind
at
that
time.
he
could’ve
sentenced,
he
could’ve
find
--
cited
him
for
contempt
during
the
trial
and
apparently
under
the
seale
decision
that
would
have
been
alright
to
sentence
him
the
six
months
and
another
contempt
another
six
months,
another
contempt
other
six
months
and
be
consecutive
and
that
would
be
fine.
but
by
waiting
to
the
end
of
the
trial,
seale
decision
and
the
argument
of
the
petitioners,
they
would
seem
to
indicate
that
that
would
have
to
accumulate.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
the
opinion
of
this
court
and
the
order
of
this
court
was
vacated
and
remanded.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
it
went
to
another
judge,
the
trial
judge.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
i
say
that
the
sentence
was
vacated
because
this
court
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
the
judgment
of
sentence
--in
pennsylvania,
i
suppose
and
most
other
jurisdictions
they
appeal
on
criminal
cases
from
the
judgment
of
the
sentence.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
right.
the
sentence
that
was
imposed
is
the
appealable.
once
the
sentence
is
imposed
the
appeal
time
starts
to
run.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
right
and
he
did
so,
on
the
basis
of
the
record.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
well,
he
didn’t
make
a
new
finding
of
appeal
of
contempt.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
at
that
point
bloom
have
been
decided.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
that
is
our
basic
[voice
overlaps).
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
we
did
argue
that
among
other
things.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
right.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
i
wish
i
had
an
opinion
to
present
to
the
court.
it
would
help
me
considerably
and
help
the
court.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
yes,
we
did
and
i
have
a
copy
of
the
brief
that
we
submitted
before
the
pennsylvania
court.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
yes,
we
do
and
i
would
submit
that
the
pennsylvania
statute
although
it
is
open-ended,
i
believe
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
look
to
the
actual
sentence
imposed
and
i
think
that
the
court
should
continue
to
do
so
and
i
would
finally
suggest
to
the
court
that
when
the
trial
judge
does
decide
to
proceed
non-jury
without
a
jury
on
a
contempt
or
several
contempts
where
he
awaits
to
end
of
trial,
i
believe
that
he
is
indicating
to
the
defendant
and
to
his
counsel
constructively
that
he
is
not
going
to
consider
these
from
reading
of
the
citations.
he
is
not
going
to
consider
these
contempts
as
serious
but
as
petty
and
under
six
months
sentence
or
six
months
sentence
or
less
is
all
that
he
will
consider
to
be
imposed
and
that
the
second
issue
that
is
presented
by
the
petitioners,
there
is
a
strong
possibility
or
substantial
possibility
of
long-term
of
an
imprisonment.
i
don’t
believe
it
is
so
except
that
the
fact
that
a
defendant
by
himself
creates
a
number
of
contemptuous
acts,
separate
contemptuous
acts
and
the
mere
fact
that
they
are
tried
together
by
the
court
may
subject
him
to
a
substantial
term
of
imprisonment
that
would
being
over
six
months,
but
the
fact
that
they
are
tried
together,
i
don’t
believe
has
any
bearing
upon
the
fact
that
they
are
individual
offenses
and
not
one
continuous
act.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
no,
i
don’t
mayberry
itself
speaks
to
the
impartiality
of
the
judge
and
the
decision
to
mayberry
i
think
assists
the
trial
courts
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
who
is
--
to
whom
being
contemptuous
acts
are
directed
and
personally
directed
must
disqualify.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
well,
under
mayberry
i
believe
that
that
is
direct
decision
and
mayberry
was
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
it
might
be
but
i
think
it
talks
more
in
terms
of
waiting
to
the
end
of
trial
that
is
another
point
that
we
dispute
to
seale
rational
making
a
difference
between
the
end
of
the
trial
and
during
trial.
the
petitioner
makes
an
argument
regarding
the
abuse
that
can
occur
at
the
end
of
the
trial
stronger
than
the
abuse
that
can
occur
by
citing
the
sentencing
during
trial.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
well,
in
the
case
of
an
attorney,
it’s
very
important
not
to
prejudice
the
defendant
in
the
eyes
of
a
jury
by
citing
an
attorney
representing
a
defendant
for
contemptuous
acts
during
that
trial.
in
this
case,
the
defendants
were
acting
as
their
own
counsel
and
the
trial
judge
may
have
felt
that
he
would
be
prejudicing
the
defendants
in
the
minds
of
a
jurors
by
citing
the
sentencing
them
during
the
trial
and
that
he
deferred
that
until
the
end
of
trial
so
there
as
not
to
prejudice
their
defense
or
to
enhance
the
commonwealth's
case
before
the
jury.
i
think
the
distinction
between
during
trial
and
end
of
trial
citing
the
sentencing,
there
reasons
for
doing
it
during
the
trial
and
the
reasons
for
doing
it
at
the
end
of
the
trial
and
i
think
each
individual
case
demands
review
and
i
think
appellate
review
is
available
and
pieces
of
discretion
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
during
the
prison
breach
trial
in
which
he
committed
to
contempts,
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
i
believe
that
is
a
--
the
trial
judge
of
course
for
this
time
was
acting
without
the
benefit
of
this
court’s
opinion
in
allen.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
true,
true.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
this
is
true,
but
i
think
that
the
appellate
courts
have
to
look
at
the
record
and
determine
the
court
--
the
same
court
that
decided
seale
case
decided
in
re
chase
and
indicated
that
opinion
that
even
when
a
trial
judge
cites
and
sentences
during
trial,
the
appellate
court
may
have
to
look
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
has
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
if
he
commits
individual
acts
of
contempt
that
are
not
series
of
events
of
one
type
but
are
so
continuous
and
contiguous
in
time
and
place
and
things
like
that
that
they
can
be
identified
as
one
continuing
act.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
i
think
the
defendant
himself
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
well,
i
think
the
court’s
interposition
of
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
is
very
important
to
defendants
where
they
draw
the
line
i
am
not
sure,
but
i
think
in
making
a
jury
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
if
i
was
a
defendant
i
might
want
to
draw
a
little
less
than
that.
i
think
--[laughter]
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
somewhat
but
i
would
indicate
that
making
a
very
strong
per
se
rule
for
the
trial
judge
to
handle
contemptuous
acts
would
be
very
detrimental.
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
has
to
have
some
discretion
that
should
impart
to
a
judge
of
use
of
discretion.
the
chase
opinion
that
i
referred
to
from
the
circuit
court
indicated
that
the
appellate
courts
must
and
can
look
to
the
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
has
by
his
own
actions
developed
a
series
of
what
he
had
identifies
as
a
contemptuous
acts.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
it's
judge
sentencing
and
i
may
indicate
to
the
court
just
for
the
information
of
the
court.
the
pennsylvania
does
have
an
indirect
criminal
contempt
statute
which
provides
for
a
jury
trial
and
it
does
have
a
maximum
sentence
of
15
days
and
a
hundred
and/or
$100
dollar
fine.
in
the
indirect
situation
of
course
you
have
a
act
to
being
committed
outside
the
presence
of
the
court
and
the
determination
by
the
legislature
of
pennsylvania
apparently
and
that
is
a
very
old
statute
was
that
a
jury
would
be
best
determined
whether
or
not
the
court’s
order
have
been
violated.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
i
think
the
allen
case
probably
is
best
solution
for
contempt
acts.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
and
the
trial
judge
did
on
remand
to
this
case
one
of
them
when
codispoti
indicated
that
he
was
no
longer
going
to
abide
by
the
decorum
of
the
court,
he
was
taken
into
an
ante
chamber
of
the
courtroom
and
the
microphone
and
loudspeaker
provided
for
him.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
primary
and
secondary
responsibility
is
prevent
further
acts
of
contempt.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
without
a
jury
trial?
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
six
months
i
believe
in
pennsylvania.[voice
overlap]
i
don’t
believe
it.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
no,
it
wouldn’t
no,
not
one
bit.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
five-and-a-half
to
six
weeks.
i
believe
that
the
commonwealth
will
argue
against
any
adoption
of
a
so
called
a
single
transaction
test
in
the
contempt
area
and
i
would
further
point
out
one
additional
case
that
the
commonwealth
has
found
in
its
research,
two
additional
cases
that
are
not
cited
in
its
brief.
one
being
aaron
v.
state
284
so.
2d
673
in
which
the
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
673.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
this
is
florida
and
the
florida
court
looked
to
its
procedural
rules
on
criminal
contempt
and
ruled
against
accumulation
of
fines
$500
fines
to
determine
the
right
to
jury
trial.
]and
another
case
that
the
commonwealth
point
out
is
in
re
puerto
rico
newspaper
guild,
local
225
which
is
found
at
476
f
2d
856.
it’s
a
first
circuit
case
that
case
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
no,
it’s
a
labor
dispute
and
the
violation
of
a
court
order.
it’s
an
indirect
contempt
case
but
it
does
indicate
non-accumulation.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
i
would
like
to
thank
the
court
for
the
opportunity
to
argue
this
cause
before
the
court.
i
specially,
i
too
would
like
to
first
go
into
some
of
the
factual
background
if
i
may.
the
original
contempts
in
this
case
occurred
in
1966
during
a
six
--
five
or
six
week-trial
on
prison
breach
charges
in
which
the
three
defendants
mayberry,
codispoti
and
langnes
committed,
mr.
mayberry
committed
11
contemptuous
acts
by
citation
of
the
trial
judge,
mr.
codispoti
by
citation
five
or
six
contempts
and
mr.
langnes
a
total
seven
contempts.
as
counsel
for
the
petitioner
has
stated
this
was
in
1966.
there
was
an
appeal
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
and
affirmance.
mr.
mayberry
chose
a
petition
to
this
court
and
the
final
decision
by
this
court
in
january
of
1971.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
briefs
the
relevant,
we
think
language
from
that
decision
as
directions
to
the
lower
court
and
that
language
if
i
may
quote,
the
court
states
that,
“our
conclusion
is
that
the
defendant
to
paraphrase
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
on
my
brief
it’s
on
page
4
and
5
of
the
commonwealth’s
brief.
the
court
through
mr.
justice
douglas
states,
“our
conclusion
is
that
by
reason
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
contempt
proceeding
must
be
given
a
public
trial
before
a
judge
other
than
the
one
involved
by
the
contempt
nor
citing
in
re
oliver.
in
the
present
case,
that
requirement
can
be
satisfied
only
if
the
judgment
of
contempt
is
vacated
so
that
on
remand
another
judge
not
bearing
the
sting
of
at
least
slanderous
remarks
and
having
the
impersonal
authority
of
the
law
sits
in
judgment
on
the
conduct
of
petitioner
as
shown
by
the
record.”
i
quote
that
because
it’s
very
important
to
the
actions
that
the
judge
--
the
second
judge
took
when
this
case
was
remanded
to
the
court
of
common
police
of
allegan
county.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
right
and
i
would
indicate
to
the
court
that
the
reason
i
bring
this
out
also
is
the
fact
that
this
case
arose
prior
to
many
of
decisions
that
are
argued
in
our
briefs
and
those
decisions
being
the
baldwin
decision
and
the
seale
decision
and
other
decisions
that
have
come
up
regarding
contempts.
the
trial
judge
at
the
trial
for
the
prison
breach
charges
was
acting
only
on
--
the
only
decision
that
has
come
down
from
this
court
to
have
been
the
chef
decision
and
the
trial
judge
felt
that
he
was
acting
fully
within
his
powers
in
sentencing
them
on
one
to
two
years.
now,
that
sentence
was
reversed
by
this
court,
was
vacated
and
the
used
sentence
was
imposed
by
another
judge.
now,
the
judge
vandervort
who
imposed
the
six
months
sentences
that
no
sentence
ultimately
was
longer
than
six
months
against
either
of
these
two
petitioners
relied
upon
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
i
might
add
the
seale
decision
had
not
been
decided
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing
of
these
six-month
sentences.
now,
on
remand
these
sentences
were
imposed
and
as
the
court
has
observed,
the
petitioners
again
engaged
in
the
conduct
which
i
would
personally
categorize
as
contemptuous
and
in
the
record
on
page
76
probably
the
most
violent
act
was
recorded
when
petitioner
langnes
after
being
told
by
the
trial
judge
that
he
was
holding
in
contempt
of
court
for
his
language
directed
at
the
court,
threw
a
microphone
at
the
court,
fortunately
it
did
not
hit
the
trial
judge,
but
that
indicates
somewhat
i
think
the
type
of
defendant
that
is
involved
in
this
case,
but
that
is
not
relevant.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
i
don’t
know
the
rational
of
the
trial
judge
in
this
case.
he
did
not
at
that
moment
sentence
him
for
that
act
of
throwing
a
microphone.
he
was
sentencing
him
for
a
contempt
for
his
language
directed
at
the
court.
continuing
with
the
history
of
case,
the
case
then
went
up
for
an
appeal
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
and
finally
to
this
court.
several
reasons
were
alleged
in
the
petition
for
cert,
but
this
court
limited
its
grant
of
--
to
the
petition
to
two
questions.
the
first
being
whether
or
not
these
sentences
that
were
given
to
these
petitioners
should
be
aggregated
in
order
to
determine
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
the
basis
for
this
is
that
all
of
these
offenses
are
somewhat
linked
as
single
offense.
the
commonwealth
would
point
out
some
of
the
factual
things
in
this
record
to
show
that
there
were
several
offenses
involved
here.
the
trial
as
i
indicated
did
occur
over
period
of
five
to
six
weeks,
the
contempts
occurred
on
various
times
during
that
six-week
period
and
were
not
continuous,
but
they
were
occasional
throughout
this
period.
co-defendant
mayberry
of
course
committed
the
11
acts,
but
the
petitioners
here
one
committed
six
acts,
the
other
committed
seven
acts.
they
occurred
over
a
period
of
six
weeks.
it's
the
commonwealth’s
position
in
this
matter
that
they
are
identifiable
as
separate
offenses
and
are
not
part
of
one
continuous
act
and
we
have
indicated
in
our
briefs
that
we
do
not
look
upon
the
acts
of
these
petitioners
as
judge
cummings
did
in
the
seale
case
where
the
defendant
in
that
case
based
most
of
his
contemptuous
conduct
on
the
fact
that
he
was
deprived
of
his
right
to
counsel
during
the
trial,
the
particular
counsel
that
he
wanted
and
that
all
of
the
actions
of
the
defendant
in
the
seale
case
were
premised
upon
that
fact.
here,
the
petitioners
engaged
in
several
different
acts
of
contempt
directed
toward
the
court
and
based
on
various
things
that
they
found
to
be
objectionable
during
the
trial.
i
would
point
also
to
this
court’s
prior
opinion
in
the
mayberry
case
for
a
solution
to
the
question
of
impartiality.
the
trial
judge
in
the
original
prison
breach
trial
against
whom
the
contempts
were
directed
was
found
by
this
court
to
be
not
capable
of
being
impartial
because
of
the
acts
of
the
defendant
committed
and
aimed
at
the
trial
judge.
we
have
a
proceeding
on
remand
before
another
trial
judge.
that
trial
judge
cannot
be
said
to
have
been
affected
by
the
decision,
by
the
acts
of
the
petitioners
and
although
the
transcript
of
the
mayberry
proceedings
are
not
before
this
court.
in
the
hearing
on
the
mayberry
contempts,
mr.
mayberry
being
very
knowledgeable
of
the
opinion
written
by
this
court
in
his
case
informed
the
court
after
he
had
committed
another
contemptuous
act
before
judge
vandervort
that
he
motioned
the
judge,
judge
vandervort
to
now
disqualify
himself
from
sitting
in
judgment
of
mr.
mayberry
because
he
was
now
been
the
object
of
the
scorn
of
mr.
mayberry
and
therefore
must
now
disqualify
himself
from
hearing
it.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
we
could
have
a
continuous
operation
with
knowledgeable
defendants
knowing
that
by
their
own
acts
direct
at
the
court
they
could
prejudice
the
court
in
the
eyes
of
an
appellate
court
and
require
another
hearing
and
perhaps
hearings
continuing
and
continuing
on
forever
i
would
submit.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
your
mean
factually?
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
no,
i
only
can
point
to
the
record
to
show
you
that
the
citations
presented
by
the
trial
judge
indicate
the
different
days
and
times
throughout
the
trial
that
these
occurred.
i
attempted
to
completely
read
the
original
prison
breach
transcript
but
it
--
that
goes
over
a
period
of
3000
some
pages
and
my
belief
is
that
this
a
series,
not
a
series
of
offenses
but
a
group
of
individual
offenses
that's
based
upon
the
length
of
trial,
the
periods
during
which
the
trial
continued
on
without
interruption
then
all
of
a
sudden
there
would
be
an
action
by
one
of
the
defendants.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
the
seale
decision
for
a
minute.
the
petitioners
base
their
argument
on
the
first
issue
presented
to
this
court
on
the
rationale
of
the
court
in
the
seale.
i
would
like
to
point
out
several
basic
fallacies
with
that
rationale.
first,
being
that
the
court
in
seale
seems
to
assume
that
the
trial
judge
is
going
to
abuse
the
contempt
power.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
opinion
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
has
given
the
power
to
summarily
sentence
a
defendant
for
a
contemptuous
acts,
direct
criminal
contemptuous
acts
that
that
trial
judge
will
abuse
that
discretion.
i
take
exception
with
that
and
would
argue
that
the
traditional
appellate
review
of
abusive
discretion
is
available
to
a
defendant
and
that
the
courts
can
find
those
abuses
and
correct
them.
i
think
it
is
very
bad
basis
for
the
decision
in
seale
that
the
trial
judge
is
assumed
to
be
subject
to
abusing
his
discretion.
as
far
as
the
second
issue
is
concerned
the
commonwealth,
first
of
all
would
take
some
exception
to
the
phrasing
of
the
issue.
the
issue
was
phrased
in
terms
of
a
substantial
term
of
imprisonment.
the
pennsylvania
contempt
statues
do
not
provide
for
a
maximum
sentence.
theoretically,
i
suppose
that
it
could
be
argued
that
the
defendant
could
subject
himself
by
contempt,
direct
criminal
contemptuous
act
to
and
unknown
sentence,
the
maximum
for
which
is
not
provided
by
statute.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
well,
the
first
trial
occurred
before
this
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
we
have
submitted
for
the
court’s
consideration
an
argument
in
our
brief
based
upon
the
rationale
in
the
case
of
jenkins
v.
delaware.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
the
rationale
there
was
that
the
miranda
decision
should
not
be
applied
to
retrials.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
that
is
true,
that
is
true
and
of
course
the
constitutional
question
of
the
right
to
jury
trial
is
an
important
question.
however,
we
would
submit
that
the
commonwealth
in
this
case
proceeded
under
the
case
law
then
existing
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
in
1966
and
that
the
trial
judge
in
sentencing
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
i
don’t
know
what
went
through
its
mind
at
that
time.
he
could’ve
sentenced,
he
could’ve
find
--
cited
him
for
contempt
during
the
trial
and
apparently
under
the
seale
decision
that
would
have
been
alright
to
sentence
him
the
six
months
and
another
contempt
another
six
months,
another
contempt
other
six
months
and
be
consecutive
and
that
would
be
fine.
but
by
waiting
to
the
end
of
the
trial,
seale
decision
and
the
argument
of
the
petitioners,
they
would
seem
to
indicate
that
that
would
have
to
accumulate.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
the
opinion
of
this
court
and
the
order
of
this
court
was
vacated
and
remanded.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
it
went
to
another
judge,
the
trial
judge.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
i
say
that
the
sentence
was
vacated
because
this
court
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
the
judgment
of
sentence
--in
pennsylvania,
i
suppose
and
most
other
jurisdictions
they
appeal
on
criminal
cases
from
the
judgment
of
the
sentence.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
right.
the
sentence
that
was
imposed
is
the
appealable.
once
the
sentence
is
imposed
the
appeal
time
starts
to
run.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
right
and
he
did
so,
on
the
basis
of
the
record.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
well,
he
didn’t
make
a
new
finding
of
appeal
of
contempt.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
at
that
point
bloom
have
been
decided.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
correct.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
that
is
our
basic
[voice
overlaps).
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
we
did
argue
that
among
other
things.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
right.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
i
wish
i
had
an
opinion
to
present
to
the
court.
it
would
help
me
considerably
and
help
the
court.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
yes,
we
did
and
i
have
a
copy
of
the
brief
that
we
submitted
before
the
pennsylvania
court.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
yes,
we
do
and
i
would
submit
that
the
pennsylvania
statute
although
it
is
open-ended,
i
believe
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
look
to
the
actual
sentence
imposed
and
i
think
that
the
court
should
continue
to
do
so
and
i
would
finally
suggest
to
the
court
that
when
the
trial
judge
does
decide
to
proceed
non-jury
without
a
jury
on
a
contempt
or
several
contempts
where
he
awaits
to
end
of
trial,
i
believe
that
he
is
indicating
to
the
defendant
and
to
his
counsel
constructively
that
he
is
not
going
to
consider
these
from
reading
of
the
citations.
he
is
not
going
to
consider
these
contempts
as
serious
but
as
petty
and
under
six
months
sentence
or
six
months
sentence
or
less
is
all
that
he
will
consider
to
be
imposed
and
that
the
second
issue
that
is
presented
by
the
petitioners,
there
is
a
strong
possibility
or
substantial
possibility
of
long-term
of
an
imprisonment.
i
don’t
believe
it
is
so
except
that
the
fact
that
a
defendant
by
himself
creates
a
number
of
contemptuous
acts,
separate
contemptuous
acts
and
the
mere
fact
that
they
are
tried
together
by
the
court
may
subject
him
to
a
substantial
term
of
imprisonment
that
would
being
over
six
months,
but
the
fact
that
they
are
tried
together,
i
don’t
believe
has
any
bearing
upon
the
fact
that
they
are
individual
offenses
and
not
one
continuous
act.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
no,
i
don’t
mayberry
itself
speaks
to
the
impartiality
of
the
judge
and
the
decision
to
mayberry
i
think
assists
the
trial
courts
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
who
is
--
to
whom
being
contemptuous
acts
are
directed
and
personally
directed
must
disqualify.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
well,
under
mayberry
i
believe
that
that
is
direct
decision
and
mayberry
was
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
it
might
be
but
i
think
it
talks
more
in
terms
of
waiting
to
the
end
of
trial
that
is
another
point
that
we
dispute
to
seale
rational
making
a
difference
between
the
end
of
the
trial
and
during
trial.
the
petitioner
makes
an
argument
regarding
the
abuse
that
can
occur
at
the
end
of
the
trial
stronger
than
the
abuse
that
can
occur
by
citing
the
sentencing
during
trial.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
well,
in
the
case
of
an
attorney,
it’s
very
important
not
to
prejudice
the
defendant
in
the
eyes
of
a
jury
by
citing
an
attorney
representing
a
defendant
for
contemptuous
acts
during
that
trial.
in
this
case,
the
defendants
were
acting
as
their
own
counsel
and
the
trial
judge
may
have
felt
that
he
would
be
prejudicing
the
defendants
in
the
minds
of
a
jurors
by
citing
the
sentencing
them
during
the
trial
and
that
he
deferred
that
until
the
end
of
trial
so
there
as
not
to
prejudice
their
defense
or
to
enhance
the
commonwealth's
case
before
the
jury.
i
think
the
distinction
between
during
trial
and
end
of
trial
citing
the
sentencing,
there
reasons
for
doing
it
during
the
trial
and
the
reasons
for
doing
it
at
the
end
of
the
trial
and
i
think
each
individual
case
demands
review
and
i
think
appellate
review
is
available
and
pieces
of
discretion
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
during
the
prison
breach
trial
in
which
he
committed
to
contempts,
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
i
believe
that
is
a
--
the
trial
judge
of
course
for
this
time
was
acting
without
the
benefit
of
this
court’s
opinion
in
allen.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
true,
true.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
this
is
true,
but
i
think
that
the
appellate
courts
have
to
look
at
the
record
and
determine
the
court
--
the
same
court
that
decided
seale
case
decided
in
re
chase
and
indicated
that
opinion
that
even
when
a
trial
judge
cites
and
sentences
during
trial,
the
appellate
court
may
have
to
look
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
has
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
if
he
commits
individual
acts
of
contempt
that
are
not
series
of
events
of
one
type
but
are
so
continuous
and
contiguous
in
time
and
place
and
things
like
that
that
they
can
be
identified
as
one
continuing
act.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
i
think
the
defendant
himself
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
well,
i
think
the
court’s
interposition
of
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
is
very
important
to
defendants
where
they
draw
the
line
i
am
not
sure,
but
i
think
in
making
a
jury
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
if
i
was
a
defendant
i
might
want
to
draw
a
little
less
than
that.
i
think
--[laughter]
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
somewhat
but
i
would
indicate
that
making
a
very
strong
per
se
rule
for
the
trial
judge
to
handle
contemptuous
acts
would
be
very
detrimental.
i
think
that
the
trial
judge
has
to
have
some
discretion
that
should
impart
to
a
judge
of
use
of
discretion.
the
chase
opinion
that
i
referred
to
from
the
circuit
court
indicated
that
the
appellate
courts
must
and
can
look
to
the
whether
or
not
the
trial
judge
has
by
his
own
actions
developed
a
series
of
what
he
had
identifies
as
a
contemptuous
acts.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
it's
judge
sentencing
and
i
may
indicate
to
the
court
just
for
the
information
of
the
court.
the
pennsylvania
does
have
an
indirect
criminal
contempt
statute
which
provides
for
a
jury
trial
and
it
does
have
a
maximum
sentence
of
15
days
and
a
hundred
and/or
$100
dollar
fine.
in
the
indirect
situation
of
course
you
have
a
act
to
being
committed
outside
the
presence
of
the
court
and
the
determination
by
the
legislature
of
pennsylvania
apparently
and
that
is
a
very
old
statute
was
that
a
jury
would
be
best
determined
whether
or
not
the
court’s
order
have
been
violated.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
i
think
the
allen
case
probably
is
best
solution
for
contempt
acts.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
and
the
trial
judge
did
on
remand
to
this
case
one
of
them
when
codispoti
indicated
that
he
was
no
longer
going
to
abide
by
the
decorum
of
the
court,
he
was
taken
into
an
ante
chamber
of
the
courtroom
and
the
microphone
and
loudspeaker
provided
for
him.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
primary
and
secondary
responsibility
is
prevent
further
acts
of
contempt.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
without
a
jury
trial?
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
six
months
i
believe
in
pennsylvania.[voice

i
don’t
believe
it.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
no,
it
wouldn’t
no,
not
one
bit.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
five-and-a-half
to
six
weeks.
i
believe
that
the
commonwealth
will
argue
against
any
adoption
of
a
so
called
a
single
transaction
test
in
the
contempt
area
and
i
would
further
point
out
one
additional
case
that
the
commonwealth
has
found
in
its
research,
two
additional
cases
that
are
not
cited
in
its
brief.

being

the
--
mr.
robert

eberhardt
673.
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
this
is
florida
and
the
florida
court
looked
to
its
procedural
rules
on
criminal
contempt
and
ruled
against
accumulation
of
fines
$500
fines
to
determine
the
right
to
jury
trial.
]and
another
case
that
the
commonwealth
point
out
is
in
re
puerto
rico
newspaper
guild,
local
225
which
is
found
at
476
f
2d
856.
it’s
a
first
circuit
case
that
case
--
mr.
robert
l.
eberhardt
no,
it’s
a
labor
dispute
and
the
violation
of
a
court
order.
it’s
an
indirect
contempt
case
but
it
does
indicate
non-accumulation.
thank
you.
