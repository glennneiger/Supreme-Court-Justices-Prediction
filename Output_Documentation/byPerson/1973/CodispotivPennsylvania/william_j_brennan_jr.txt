not
the
contempt
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
he
part
of
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
was
to
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
what
about
this
contempt
proceeding,
was
he
involved
in
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
mayberry
was
again
convicted,
wasn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
a
sentence
comparable
of
the
one
than
the
first?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
had
--
didn’t
seek
review
of
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mayberry
will
serve
his
four
years
and
two
months
whatever
it
is?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
any
event,
he
didn’t
seek
review
of
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
he
is
not
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
take
it.
your
view
were
to
prevail,
the
other
judge
would
be
in
a
position
if
they
had
multiple
counts
in
the
citation.
almost
inevitably
and
having
to
have
a
jury
trial
because
his
only
alternative
would
be
then
than
there
to
decide
that
however
many
of
the
counts
was
other
than
guilty
convictions,
no
sentence
would
be
more
than
six
months
and
all
sentences
would
be
concurrent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather
your
--
basically
you
say
because
by
imposing
consecutive
sentences
on
a
number
of
counts,
you
get
in
excess
of
six
months
without
a
jury
trial
and
constitutionally
that
can’t
be
done,
is
that
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
i’m
suggesting
is
when
the
other
judge
gets
as
he
did
here
a
citation
with
multiple
accounts,
but
were
11
here
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
the
number
was,
isn’t
his
choice
whether
to
have
a
jury
trial
going
to
require
him
then
and
there
to
decide
that
no
i
won’t
give
a
jury
trial
because
what
i’ll
do
if
i
find
guilty
on
any
count
is
to
impose
not
more
than
six
months
sentence
on
any
count
and
make
all
sentences
concurrent.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
do
you
suggest
he
could
not
do
that
and
deny
a
jury
trial
if
he
decided
that’s
what
he
was
[voice
overlap]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
i
am
suggesting
mr.
dean,
is
i
would
think
sitting
as
a
trial
judge
but
i
have
to
say
to
myself
when
i
get
10
to
11
counts
in
the
citation,
i
better
have
a
jury
trial
since
obviously
if
he
is
guilty
on
any
substantial
number
of
them,
six
months
may
not
be
enough
or
say
to
myself
well
i
would
have
a
jury
trial
because
i
will
decide
now
that
however
many
counts
i
find
them
guilty,
i’ll
impose
concurrent
sentences
none
in
excess
of
six
months.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
also
mr.
eberhardt,
your
supreme
court
on
the
first
appeal
in
the
mayberry
case
before
the
case
came
here
relying
on
our
--
the
stefano
that
bloom
was
perspective
only
sustained
the
consecutive
sentences
initially
imposed
on
mayberry.
now,
when
after
the
second
trial,
it
went
back
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
i
notice
that
there
is
a
one
sentence
per
curiam,
the
judgments
of
contempt
are
affirmed.
did
you
argue
before
the
state
supreme
court
that
the
same
rationale
that
bloom
was
not
but
retroactive
required
affirmance
of
those
convictions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
we
have
no
way
of
knowing.
i
see
that
judge
mandarino
was
the
only
the
dissenter.
whereas
in
the
first
trial
mr.
justice
roberts
and
i
think
mr.
justice
o’brien
took
the
view
that
they
concurred
only
because
bloom
was
not
retroactive.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
how
are
we
to
read
this
judgment
of
contempt
that
are
affirmed
on
the
second
go
around?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
did
in
any
event
argue
that
for
the
same
reason
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
and
you
repeat
that
argument
here
as
i
read
page
15
of
your
brief,
don’t
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
puerto
rico,
what’s
that?
puerto
rican
crime?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
dean,
what
do
you
think
of
this
one
line
affirmance
of
the
supreme
court
after
as
i
understand
your
colleague
haven't
urged
that
the
non-retroactivity
of
bloom
required
or
permitted
in
any
event
affirmance
of
the
consecutive
sentences.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
that
were
the
basis
of
the
affirmance,
have
you
any
comment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
the
stefano
held
it
was
not
retroactive.
