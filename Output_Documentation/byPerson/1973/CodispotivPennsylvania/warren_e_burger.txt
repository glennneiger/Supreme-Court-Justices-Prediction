chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-5615,
codispoti
and
others
against
pennsylvania.
mr.
dean,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
the
courts
under
illinois
against
allen
could
have
bound
and
gag
these
defendants
as
we
said
they
could
in
illinois
against
allen,
and
then
appoint
counsel
for
them
without
regard
to
what
they
felt
about
counsel
or
appointing
alternatively
counsel
as
friends
of
the
court
to
act
for
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
say
it
took
six
weeks
to
try
this?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
does
he
make
the
request
politely,
on
what
page?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
any
request
that
he
made
politely
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
43
where
you’ve
said
his
conduct
was
polite,
do
you
regard
it
as
polite
conduct
when
he
suggests
to
the
court
that
the
judge
and
the
prison
authorities
are
engaged
in
a
conspiracy
to
railroad
him,
at
the
bottom
of
43?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
we
have
observed
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
suggesting
we
should
--
that
they
should
not
have
been
brought
into
a
courtroom?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
was
what
i
had
in
mind
when
i
was
reading
pages
46,
47
and
48
in
that
area
when
i
asked
you
whether
the
judge,
if
he
cared
to
say
would’ve
been
justified
in
binding
and
gagging
them
and
then
having
a
lawyer
go
ahead
and
conduct
the
proceedings
on
the
basis
of
the
prior
record.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
did
the
judge
have
any
other
choice
under
illinois
against
allen?
did
the
court
rely
on
illinois
against
allen
by
the
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
want
another
judge
and
the
jury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
then
i
think
we
--
the
subject
came
up
in
the
mayberry
case
that
i
have
forgotten
the
answer,
does
pennsylvania
have
a
statute
on
obstruction
of
justice
by
way
of
conduct
to
this
kind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
dean.
mr.
eberhardt.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
mayberry
opinion
undertake
to
carve
out
any
time
zones
on
the
contempt
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
is
anything
in
mayberry
or
the
cases
prior
to
mayberry
that
are
discussed
here
that
prevents
a
citation
for
each
individual
episode
of
contempt
to
be
tried
separately
whether
it
was
embraced
within
the
day
or
one
episode
and
then
in
the
case
of
11
contempts
on
11
separate
days
to
try
him
seriatim
one
after
or
another
for
each
contempt
without
a
jury
on
a
summary
proceeding
give
him
six
months
on
each
one
and
if
the
judge
is
--
the
new
judge
wanted
to
make
them
consecutive
to
go
ahead
and
do
so?
you
seem
to
be
the
mayberry
that
would
preclude
that
or
in
other
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
you
have
to
get
new
judge
then
for
each
case
under
mayberry?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
least
it
implies
that
that
might
be
necessary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
there
an
important
reason
why
the
contempt
proceeding
is
deferred
until
the
end
of
the
trial
whether
it’s
directed
against
the
defendant
or
against
his
lawyer?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
longest
sentence
that
can
be
imposed
for
a
misdemeanor
assault
type
of
case
in
pennsylvania
without
a
jury
trial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
up
to
six
months?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
the
same
gentleman
being
put
out
with
the
whole
system
of
justice
should
meet
the
judge
on
10
successive
days
and
hit
him
over
the
head
with
a
baseball
bat,
on
each
of
those
10
successive
days,
would
it
defend
your
sense
of
justice
if
you
were
charged
with
10
separate
assaults?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
these
verbal
assaults
to
the
dignity
of
the
court
extended
over
a
period
of
six
weeks
or
six-and-a-half
weeks
did
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you.
mr.
dean,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief

warren
e.

we’ll
hear

next
in

on

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
any
request
that
he
made
politely
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
43
where
you’ve
said
his
conduct
was
polite,
do
you
regard
it
as
polite
conduct
when
he
suggests
to
the
court
that
the
judge
and
the
prison
authorities
are
engaged
in
a

chief

are
you
suggesting
we
should
--
that
they
should
not

a
courtroom?
