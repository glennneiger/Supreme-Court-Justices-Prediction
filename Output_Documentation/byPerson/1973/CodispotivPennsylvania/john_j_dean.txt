mr.
john
j.
dean
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
once
again
there
is
before
this
court
the
relatively
troublesome
problem
of
the
right
of
a
defendant
charged
with
direct
criminal
contempt
to
the
court
to
have
a
jury
of
his
peers
decide
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence.
procedurally,
this
is
case
is
relatively
confused,
however
the
issues
are
easily
framed
and
quite
clear.
dominick
codispoti
together
with
herbert
langnes
and
richard
oj
mayberry
came
on
for
trial
in
pittsburgh,
pennsylvania
back
in
november
of
1966
on
charges
of
prison
breach
and
holding
a
hostage
in
a
penal
institution.
the
trial
lasted
approximately
six
weeks
and
was
marked
by
repeated
altercations
between
the
trial
judge
and
between
the
defendants.
the
defendants
were
found
guilty.
they
were
given
a
15
to
30
year
sentence
on
one
charge,
a
consecutive
five
to
10
sentence
on
other
charge,
and
immediately
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
the
trial
judge
summoned
them
up
some
--
sentenced
them
anywhere
from
11
to
22
years
for
the
contempt
of
court
for
the
various
statements
that
had
been
made
in
the
presence
of
the
court.
they
then
appealed
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
and
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
affirmed
their
conviction
with
several
justices
dissenting
upon
with
theory
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
and
since
this
case
had
antedated
the
baldwin
decision
perhaps
on
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
john
j.
dean
your
honor,
count
advisers
as
our
court
called
them
in
1966
were
appointed
to
help
these
people
who
were
representing
themselves
as
their
own
counsel.
whether
or
not
factually
their
disturbances
were
so
tumultuous
that
would
require
an
allen
type
of
gagging,
i
am
not
really
prepared
to
say
because
i
wasn’t
there,
i
have
the
record
there.
the
record
is
in
somewhat
of
a
contention
as
to
exactly
what
was
the
genesis
of
this
confrontation
between
the
defendants
and
the
justice.
mr.
john
j.
dean
i
think
it’s
about
six
and
a
half
weeks
sir,
yes.
the
trial
started
in
november
of
1966
and
concluded
i
think
on
about
december
the
12th
of
1966
and
i
think
there
few
days
that
the
court
took
of
for
procedural
matters
and
other
issues
but
essentially
it
was
a
six-week
trial.
mr.
john
j.
dean
not
the
contempt
trial.
this
was
--
as
i
said
the
case
was
procedurally
confused.
they
were
originally
before
the
court
on
a
prison
breach
and
holding
hostage
in
a
penal
institution.
during
that
trial
in
1966
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
contempts,
these
are
the
contempts
that
are
currently
before
this
court.
mr.
john
j.
dean
that’s
right,
only
with
the
contempt
trial.
what
then
happened
was
that
they
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
which
affirmed
the
conviction.
they
petitioned
this
court
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
which
was
granted.
this
court
heard
the
case
and
in
january
of
1971,
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
douglas
remanded
the
case
back
to
pennsylvania
for
a
public
trial
for
the
words
that
were
used.
the
case
lay
dormant
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
mayberry
was
the
only
petitioner
really
before
the
court
directly,
although
he
under
the
order
seem
to
drag
in
codispoti
and
langnes
with
him.
what
makes
this
case
confusing
now
is
mayberry
is
no
longer
here,
it’s
just
langnes
and
codispoti.
mr.
john
j.
dean
mr.
mayberry
chose
not
to
go
to
this
court.
i
can’t
really
offer
you
a
rationale
explanation
of
that
action,
but
we
now
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
no,
he’s
not
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
dean
yes,
your
honor,
in
the
first
case
that
we
had
he
was
a
sole
party.
mr.
john
j.
dean
yes,
your
honor.
what
then
happened
was
when
the
case
was
remanded
back
in
january
of
1971,
judge
fiok
who
was
the
trial
judge
in
1966
against
whom
the
original
contempts
were
leveled,
on
december
7
of
1971,
almost
a
year
later
issued
a
citation
which
was
to
be
served
by
registered
mail
upon
the
three
defendants
scheduling
a
hearing,
separate
hearings
for
each
of
the
defendants
on
anywhere
from
december
12
to
december
17.
mr.
mayberry
went
the
trial
first
in
front
of
judge
vandervort,
then
mr.
codispoti
went
to
trial
then
mr.
langnes
went
to
trial.
they
had
separate
individual
trials
or
hearings
depending
on
how
you’re
going
to
characterize
it.
mr.
john
j.
dean
mayberry
was
again
adjudicated
in
contempt
of
court
and
sentenced.
mr.
john
j.
dean
no,
your
honor.
what
occurred
in
that
case
was
that
by
the
expedient
of
giving
a
six-month
sentence
and
by
making
them
consecutive,
mayberry
was
again
convicted
on
all
of
the
charges
that
he
was
originally
cited
for
by
judge
fiok
and
given
11
to
22
years
sentence
but
mr.
mayberry
came
up
with
something
like
a
--
i
think
a
four-year
two-month
sentence
was
his
sentence.
mr.
john
j.
dean
he
again
appealed
that
sentences
to
the
other
ones
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
which
this
time
affirmed
pre
curiam
with
judgment
of
contempt.
however,
they
--
one
justice
did
dissent
based
upon
the
united
states
versus
seale
rationale.
at
that
point,
codispoti
and
langnes
petitioned
this
court
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
which
was
granted,
which
is
why
we
are
now
up
here
in
front
of
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
evidently,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
dean
i
was
court-appointed
counsel.
mr.
mayberry
has
refused
to
talk
to
me
during
some
of
these
proceedings
so
i
am
somewhat
hard
pressed
to
give
you
[attempt
to
laughter]
a
viable
rationale
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
he
is
not
in
front
of
the
court.
at
this
time
all
we
have
are
codispoti
and
langnes.
it
is
important
perhaps
to
get
into
some
of
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
because
of
the
arguments
advanced,
all
of
the
trials
of
mayberry,
codispoti,
and
langnes
were
exactly
similar.
in
other
words,
i
don’t
think
there
was
a
substantial
difference
between
one
or
the
other.
mr.
langnes
had
or
mr.
codispoti,
excuse
me,
had
come
in
and
requested
that
counsel
of
his
own
choice
be
there
to
represent
him.
the
court
said
but
where
is
your
counsel
and
the
counsel
was
in
philadelphia
and
the
judge
vandervort
said,
“well,
he’s
not
in
the
courtroom
now,
you
have
a
public
defender,
go
proceed
with
him.”
mr.
codispoti
had
said
that
he
didn’t
have
any
notice
of
this
hearing
really
until
he
was
brought
in
to
pittsburgh,
pennsylvania
the
morning
of
the
trial
that
he
had
written
the
trial
judge,
judge
fiok
twice
after
the
remand
saying,
what
are
you
going
to
do
or
words
to
that
effect
and
had
received
no
reply.
mr.
codispoti
then
requested
a
jury
trial
and
in
exactly
similar
language
that
the
court
had
used
for
langnes
and
mayberry
said,
the
court;
i
regard
this
issue
mr.
codispoti
as
an
issue
between
the
court,
not
any
particular
judge
but
between
the
court
and
you
and
i
think
the
record
should
speak
for
the
court
and
you
can
speak
for
yourself
and
i
am
going
to
refuse
your
motion
for
jury
trial.
evidently,
these
people
had
some
idea
because
they
had
known
what
had
gone
on
before.
mr.
codispoti
then
said,
“well,
i
would
like
some
defense
witnesses
who
were
present
during
the
original
arbitration
between
judge
fiok
and
myself,
present
to
testify
in
my
behalf.”
at
the
second
hearing
he
was
denied
under
these
words
the
court;
i
am
going
to
refuse
your
motion
to
subpoena
witnesses
for
the
reasons
that
i
told
you.
i
think
that
this
is
an
issue
between
the
court
and
you
and
the
record
will
speak
for
the
court
and
you
and
your
counsel
can
speak
for
yourself.
and
this
is
what
happened
in
every
single
trial
that
came
along.
so
with
those
words,
they
were
denied
the
right
to
a
jury
trial,
they
were
denied
the
right
to
present
defense
witnesses,
and
they
were
entitled
to
speak
for
themselves,
the
record
will
speak
for
the
court.
they
weren’t
even
permitted
to
call
the
trial
judge
who
simply
resided
maybe
50
or
65
feet
in
a
courtroom
immediately
adjacent
to
the
courtroom
where
the
trial
was
being
held.
that
brings
us
to
the
issue
here.
they
were
found
and
adjudicated
guilty
on
all
of
these
contempts
of
court.
on
one
of
them,
they
received
two
months
and
on
one
of
the
contempts
charges,
they
had
received
a
sentence
of
six
months.
mr.
codispoti,
for
some
reason
that’s
not
quite
apparent
to
me
was
sentenced
to
a
year
for
one
contempt
and
the
court
has
set
out
in
the
appendix
had
simply
said
we
sentence
to
a
year
for
citation
number
5
or
whatever
it
was.
approximately,
a
month
later
the
court
revised
this
“rough
draft
sentencing”
to
make
it
down
into
six
months.
all
of
the
sentences
ran
consecutively
and
therefore
they
were
imprisoned
approximately
from
three
to
--
two
to
three
years,
give
or
take
a
few
months
one
way
or
the
other.
and
that
brings
us
somewhat
so
through
this
route
in
order
to
a
appreciate
the
issues
here,
the
question
of
when
there
are
--
when
there
is
a
single
trial
for
a
multiple
contempts
that
have
occurred
during
a
particular
trial,
does
the
person’s
right
to
a
jury
trial
depend
upon
the
aggregate
sentence
received,
in
this
case
several
years,
or
does
it
depend
upon
the
individual
sentences
received
namely
a
six-month
sentence
which
is
aggregated
into
a
three-year
sentence.
we
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
when
there
is
one
single
trial
that
the
appropriate
remedy
is
to
look
at
the
penalty
imposed
in
the
total
because
it
makes
little
difference
to
the
man
who
is
sitting
in
jail
to
say,
“oh,
you’re
only
in
jail
for
six
months
but
you’re
in
jail
six
months
10
times,
than
to
say
that
you’re
in
jail
for
five
years.”
it
makes
absolutely
no
difference
to
him
in
regards
to
the
length
of
his
incarceration.
mr.
john
j.
dean
we’re
talking
about
11
to
22
years
sir.
he
was
given
a
one
to
two-year
sentence
on
each
contempt.
mr.
john
j.
dean
no,
your
honor,
not
directly.
the
concluding
words
of
mr.
justice
douglas
were
that
it
was
to
be
remanded
back
for
a
public
trial.
there
was
some
discussion
in
the
lower
court
whether
the
words
public
trial
were
to
be
interpreted
as
to
mean
jury
trial.
the
trial
judge,
judge
vandervort
decided
that
it
did
not
mean
a
jury
trial.
mr.
john
j.
dean
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
presumptuous
of
me
to
try
to
impute
the
reasons
for
this
court
as
to
why
they
did
a
particular
action
in
a
particular
case.
i
don’t
think
it
does,
to
answer
your
question
however.
i
don’t
think
it
has
any
direct
significance
because
i
don’t
think
the
problem
was
essentially
before
this
court.
i
would
like
to
think
that
the
words
public
trial
meant
a
trial
by
jury
and
that
the
court
did
not
believe
that
all
of
a
sudden
these
people
were
not
to
have
a
jury
trial
on
these
contempt
charges.
mr.
john
j.
dean
there
was
one
your
honor.
they
were
somewhat
obstreperous
and
one
of
the
defendants
was
given
a
chance
to
recant
and
he
had
cast
impolite
language
upon
the
competency
of
judge
fiok
and
the
judge
asked
him
if
you
wanted
to
--
judge
vandervort
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
recant
as
to
the
mental
ability
of
judge
fiok.
he
did
that
by
saying
that
he
found
somebody
or
perhaps
lesser
mental
ability
than
judge
fiok
which
was
the
present
trial
judge.
[laughter
attempt]
i
don’t
think
that
was
really
the
recantation
that
they
expected
and
he
received
another
six
months
sentence
for
that
slight
outburst.
mr.
john
j.
dean
yes
your
honor,
he
was
sentenced
to
six,
i
believe
it
was
codispoti
was
sentenced
six
months
or
langnes.
i
am
ruling
out
certain
roots
because
the
trials
were
so
similar
adverse
occurred.
to
my
knowledge
and
i
was
present
at
those
trials
or
most
of
those
trials,
only
one
of
them
was
given
an
additional
sentence.
you
see
your
honor,
in
some
sense
as
mr.
codispoti
said
he
had
been
up
there,
he’d
requested
very
politely
this
and
then
it’s
in
page
5
of
our
brief
have
been
denied
his
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
you
mean
within
here
sir?
are
the
request
politely?
mr.
john
j.
dean
or
you
mean
for
jury
trial
and
so
forth?
mr.
john
j.
dean
alright,
on
page
four
of
the
brief,
your
honor
are
the
--
i
am
sorry
appendix
43,
excuse
me
as
where
in
the
appendix
it
would
be
for
mr.
codispoti,
he
starts
up
here.
i
would
say
it
would
be
reasonably
polite
as
a
trial
lawyer
he
had
requested
to
the
jury
trial,
but
the
court
said,
“no,
you
can’t
have
it.”
he
had
then
on
around
pages
45
approximately
at
the
middle
of
the
case
said
that
according
to
baldwin
versus
new
york
and
bloom
versus
illinois
and
duncan
that
he
would
like
a
jury
trial
and
that
he’d
be
given
14
years
and
he
thinks
that
it
was
relatively
serious
crime
at
that
particular
point.
the
court
said
that
it
is
just
between
you
and
the
court.
he
then
asked
for
witnesses
and
i
assumed
that
that
was
a
relatively
polite
request,
appeared
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
for
me,
at
least
nothing
that
would
certainly
shock
the
contents
of
the
court
to
disrupt
these
procedures.
what
then
did
occur
is
we
have
an
evaluation
of
the
trial
judge
at
least
if
he
had
been
polite
because
on
page
47
mr.
codispoti
states
to
the
court
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
well,
your
honor,
perhaps
that
--
alright
i
will
not
say
that’s
the
most
polite
way.
polite
i
meant
in
response
to
your
question
of
failure
to
use
obscene
language.[attempt
to
laughter]
the
language
got
to
be
a
little
bit
probably
make
a
stevedore
blush
after
a
while.
mr.
john
j.
dean
but
it
any
event,
he
does
say
here
on
page
47,
there
is
one
thing
and
this
is
mr.
codispoti
saying,
there
is
one
and
this
is
after
he
has
been
denied
this,
“there’s
one
thing
i
want
to
make
clear.
i
came
in
this
courtroom
trying
to
be
respectful
right”
and
the
trial
judge
answers,
“you
have
been”
which
until
that
point
mr.
codispoti’s
behavior
will
perhaps
not
within
the
standards
of
conduct
one
would
expect
from
an
attorney
had
not
been
the
obstreperous
that
had
attended
these
other
litigations
in
court.
and
he
says,
“now
you
that
know
i
have
90
years
and
really
another
10
to
20
years
on
top
of
a
90
years
sentence,
the
words
are
to
the
effect
is
not
going
to
certainly
sway
him
one
way
or
the
other.
i
think
it’s
important
to
understand
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
yes,
sir.
that’s
what
i
meant
by
saying
that
he
was
relatively
polite
in
the
beginning.
unfortunately,
that
language
did
attend
most
of
these
proceedings.
this
gentleman,
i
think
has
spent
i
would
say
consecutive
25
years
in
prison.
perhaps,
in
the
some
instances
it
is
strange.
this
entire
group
has
started
out
rebelling
against
prison
authority.
mayberry
was
incarcerated
at
age
12
for
being
a
dependent
neglected
child
and
he
has
never
escaped
from
the
penal
authority
sentence
since
he
has
been
engaged
in
one
continuing
arbitration
after
another.
in
some
sense
in
trying
these
people
for
contempt
of
court
case
would
almost
be
like
beating
a
masochist
with
whips
for
punishment.
i
mean,
you
bring
these
people
into
a
courtroom
and
unfortunately
you’re
giving
them
an
opportunity
to
go
on
and
do
things
which
they
don’t
really
have.
mr.
john
j.
dean
your
honor,
if
it
were
my
personal
opinion,
i
feel
they
are
very
sick
individuals.
i
don’t
think
that
their
conduct
is
in
anyway
justifiable.
i
don’t
think
it’s
really
the
conduct
that
one
will
expect
of
a
rational
human
being.
i
think
these
people
have
an
extreme
problem.
i
don’t
think
the
legal
system
is
really
within
the
system
of
punishment
and
imprisonment
the
way
to
effectively
handle
these
individuals
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
in
the
judge
vandervort
proceedings
what
you’re
talking
about,
i
thought
the
original
you’re
talking
about
the
judge
fiok
proceedings.
mr.
john
j.
dean
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
eventually,
the
defendants
were
excluded
from
the
courtroom
in
the
course
of
these
trials.
mr.
john
j.
dean
not
to
my
direct
knowledge
your
honor,
no.
i
am
somewhat
hazy
on
the
rational
that
judge
vandervort
did
use
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
could
exclude
the
defendants
but
effectively
he
did
exclude
them.
he
had
them
placed
in
an
ante
room
with
a
loudspeaker
so
they
could
hear
what
was
going
on
for
the
entire
proceedings.
but
if
i
may,
the
situation
that
we
would
like
to
say,
is
that
under
situations
such
as
this
particular
case
that
where
people
do
receive
a
cumulative
sentence
that
there
are
several
strong
policy
reasons
why
this
court
should
demand
a
jury
trial
in
an
aggregated
sentence.
generally,
the
reasons
for
petty
cases
not
being
required
to
have
a
jury
trial
is
maybe
that
they’re
too
small
to
really
worry
about
that
a
couple
of
days,
we
can’t
worry
about
judicial
economy.
we
have
to
make
sure
the
court
schedule
flows
well.
but
as
i
suggested
to
the
court
earlier
that
has
a
relatively
hollow
ring
to
man
incarcerated
for
three
years.
there
was
also
the
problem
that
generally
the
power
of
the
court
to
punish
direct
criminal
contempts
that
occurred
incur
in
front
of
it
can
be
grounded
in
a
prophylactic
rule
that
at
least
it
will
begin
to
restore
order
to
the
courtroom
in
an
abstractor
situation
because
of
the
immediacy
of
punishment
it’s
the
act
that
is
deterrent
to
future
conduct.
but
in
this
particular
case
or
in
any
case
where
the
individual
contempt
problems
are
accumulated
and
then
tried
subsequent
or
termination
of
the
main
judicial
proceeding,
that
prophylactic
rational
has
no
longer
any
viability.
finally,
the
real
problem
in
this
is
the
problem
of
judicial
abuse.
i
was
sitting
down
talking
with
some
lawyers
and
they
said
it
to
me
that
ours
is
probably
the
only
profession
in
the
world
where
a
trial
lawyer
can
be
put
in
jail
for
being
late
for
work
because
if
you
come
late
in
front
of
the
court,
its
well
within
the
competency
of
the
judge
to
put
you
in
jail
and
there’s
probably
no
other
single
profession
where
that
penalty
is
imposed
for
being
late.
mr.
john
j.
dean
[laughter
attempt]
perhaps
in
the
military
but
often
times
do
not
in
the
military
voluntarily,
but
at
least
you
haven’t
been
in
the
past
that
was
not
a
matter
of
choice
being
in
there.
mr.
john
j.
dean
that’s
probably
true
at
this
point
at
least
most
of
them
are.
however,
would
surrender
that
necessarily
get
out
their
discretion.
but
the
problem
was
that
these
people
viewed
codispoti,
mayberry
and
langnes
have
viewed
the
prison
authorities
as
you
stated,
mr.
chief
justice,
are
working
together,
being
in
a
league
against
that
what
they
want
is
some
appearance
of
impartiality
and
as
the
court
can
tell
from
the
way
that
these
proceedings
went
codispoti’s
frustration
was
obviously
eminent
in
the
language
that
we
wrote
from
the
appendix
47,
that
his
problem
was
that
he
wanted
a
fair
trial
and
exactly
the
same
thing
happened
in
everybody’s
trial.
they
asked
for
the
jury,
it's
denied.
they
asked
for
witnesses,
it's
denied.
they
asked
for
counsel,
it’s
denied.
they
are
told
to
go
to
trial
with
appointed-counsel
right
now
and
at
least
i
am
not
saying
that
a
jury
may
have
arrived
at
different
determination
than
the
trial
judge
did.
i
don’t
think
that’s
really
a
central
issue
here.
it’s
not
a
question
legitimately
before
this
court,
but
what
the
problem
is
that
at
least
if
there
was
a
jury
interposed
between
the
judiciary
who
happens
to
be
not
only
the
prosecutor,
not
only
the
person
who
presented
the
charges,
not
only
the
trier
of
fact
but
also
the
imposer
of
sentence,
to
at
least
get
a
third
party
in
there
in
the
fact-finding
position
has
a
lot
to
recommend
it.
and
also,
it’s
very
difficult
to
insulate
one
judge
who
was
worked
with
another
judge
say
for
20
years
and
say
that
he
is
going
to
be
the
completely
impartial
arbiter
of
dispenser
of
justice
that
our
american
legal
system
tends
to
look
upon
the
judiciary.
mr.
john
j.
dean
yes,
your
honor,
i
did
not
argue
mayberry
originally
before
this
court,
but
it
is
my
understanding
that
was
argued
and
that’s
what
was
done.
it
was
sent
back
for
a
trial
in
front
of
another
judge
which
was
done
in
this
particular
case.
what
i’m
suggesting
however,
is
that
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
another
judge
and
the
jury
is
what
we
would
like
in
this
particular
instance.
there
is
another
question
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
no.
which
mayberry
opinion
you’re
referring
to?
mr.
john
j.
dean
say
anything
about
this
particular
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
dean
a
jury
trial?
mr.
john
j.
dean
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
dean
no,
not
to
my
knowledge,
they
did
not
say
that
there
was
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
--
it
was
not
to
be
a
jury
trial
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
john
j.
dean
i
am
sorry
--
i
understand
exact
the
exact
thrust
of
your
question.
mr.
john
j.
dean
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
dean
yes
well
that
it
varied
among
the
individual
[voice
overlap].
mr.
john
j.
dean
your
honor
he
can
do
that.
i
don’t
think
that’s
a
rational
that
you’re
going
to
encourage.
mr.
john
j.
dean
obviously,
he
could
do
that,
your
honor.
i
mean
there’s
no
two
ways.
the
problem
with
the
six
months
aggregation
rule
is
that
you
have
one
may
be
very
serious
contempt
charge
weighed
with
several
minor
charges
and
the
court
instead
of
affording
a
jury
trial
in
the
series
contempt
charge
can
allocate
the
total
sentence
into
six
months
pieces
apart
and
thereby
effectively
deprive
a
person
to
jury
trial.
i
do
not
think
the
judiciary
should
be
encouraged,
the
lower
court
judiciary
to
be
encourage
to
deprive
people
from
jury
trials
so
that
lift
the
views
of
consecutive
[voice
overlap].
mr.
john
j.
dean
i
will
just
--
i
would
think
that
would
be
not
acceptable
approach
to
the
problem.
your
honor,
if
i
can
i
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
john
j.
dean
not
of
that
particular
time,
no
your
honor.
there
is
no
applicable
statute
governing
back
an
obstruction
of
justice.
mr.
john
j.
dean
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
what
this
shows
is
that
somewhat
high
miracle
characterization
they
can
attend
our
contempt
analysis
here
because
one
thing
that
--
i
think
has
emerged
in
regards
both
of
the
presentations
here
today
is
that
when
this
case
originally
came
up
to
the
court,
the
chief
justice
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
had
termed
his
conduct
outrageous.
mr.
justice
douglas
of
this
court
termed
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
a
shock
to
those
raised
in
the
western
tradition
of
justice.
he
had
received
11
to
22
years
sentence
and
all
of
a
sudden
when
he
comes
back
for
a
trial
what
has
become
at
least
according
to
the
characterizations
of
the
our
new
original
trial
judge
the
justice
of
the
or
the
chief
justice
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
and
the
justice
of
this
court
as
outrageous
has
been
transformed
into
a
petty
contempt.
and
i
feel
that
that
type
of
labeling
putting
on
these
are
crime
is
what
brings
to
fore
the
problem
of
looking
solely
to
the
actual
sentence
received
on
each
crime
rather
than
the
aggregate
sentence
because
by
looking
at
the
aggregate
sentence,
the
effectiveness,
the
total
problem
that
gets
up
here
is
well
before
the
court.
mr.
john
j.
dean
i
argued
the
case
your
honor
in
front
of
the
court.
that
issue
was
raised.
i
had
cited
the
court’s
previous
opinions
of
two
of
the
justices
who
were
currently
on
the
court
in
both
instances
and
i
can
give
you
no
possible
explanation.
mr.
john
j.
dean
that
bloom
was
not
retroactive?
mr.
john
j.
dean
i
just
don’t
think
that’s
a
correct
legal
reasoning.
mr.
john
j.
dean
i
think
it
has
to
be
retroactive
because
it
was
such
a
fundamental
right
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
well,
let
me
say
this,
i
used
the
wrong
the
choice
of
words
there.
i
don’t
think
retroactivity
is
a
real
problem
first
of
all
because
the
trial
was
occurring
subsequent
to
that.
i
don’t
think
retroactivity
really
gets
in
to
this
issue
but
even
assuming
that
retroactivity
did
get
into
the
issue,
the
test
of
this
court
has
used
to
see
whether
a
constitutional
right
shall
be
applied
retroactively
are
usually
would
it
result
in
changes
in
the
police
procedures,
would
it
result
in
considerable
disruption,
would
it
result
in
releasing
other
criminals
or
things
like
this.
and
i
don’t
think
any
of
the
tests
under
the
linkletter
approach
have
any
negative
value
to
stop
this
from
being
applied
if
you
want
to
use
that
characterization
retroactively.
i
think
it
could
easily
be
applied
retroactively.
it
is
my
understanding
of
pennsylvania
law
that
we
were
require
jury
trial
for
all
crimes.
we
just
have
a
new
felony
code.
before
we
had
felonies
and
misdemeanors,
we
now
have
them
graded
felonies
and
graded
misdemeanors.
any
misdemeanor
requires
a
jury
trial
in
our
court.
mr.
john
j.
dean
there’s
absolutely
no
maximum
sentence
on
contempt
of
court.
mr.
john
j.
dean
yes,
the
judge
is
the
one
who
has
absolute
discretion
over
the
sentencing
and
absent
a
very
clear
abuse
of
discretion
our
appellate
courts
will
not
review
a
sentencing
judge's
determination.
mr.
john
j.
dean
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
once
again
there
is
before
this
court
the
relatively
troublesome
problem
of
the
right
of
a
defendant
charged
with
direct
criminal
contempt
to
the
court
to
have
a
jury
of
his
peers
decide
the
issue
of
guilt
or
innocence.
procedurally,
this
is
case
is
relatively
confused,
however
the
issues
are
easily
framed
and
quite
clear.
dominick
codispoti
together
with
herbert
langnes
and
richard
oj
mayberry
came
on
for
trial
in
pittsburgh,
pennsylvania
back
in
november
of
1966
on
charges
of
prison
breach
and
holding
a
hostage
in
a
penal
institution.
the
trial
lasted
approximately
six
weeks
and
was
marked
by
repeated
altercations
between
the
trial
judge
and
between
the
defendants.
the
defendants
were
found
guilty.
they
were
given
a
15
to
30
year
sentence
on
one
charge,
a
consecutive
five
to
10
sentence
on
other
charge,
and
immediately
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
the
trial
judge
summoned
them
up
some
--
sentenced
them
anywhere
from
11
to
22
years
for
the
contempt
of
court
for
the
various
statements
that
had
been
made
in
the
presence
of
the
court.
they
then
appealed
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
and
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
affirmed
their
conviction
with
several
justices
dissenting
upon
with
theory
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
and
since
this
case
had
antedated
the
baldwin
decision
perhaps
on
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
john
j.
dean
your
honor,
count
advisers
as
our
court
called
them
in
1966
were
appointed
to
help
these
people
who
were
representing
themselves
as
their
own
counsel.
whether
or
not
factually
their
disturbances
were
so
tumultuous
that
would
require
an
allen
type
of
gagging,
i
am
not
really
prepared
to
say
because
i
wasn’t
there,
i
have
the
record
there.
the
record
is
in
somewhat
of
a
contention
as
to
exactly
what
was
the
genesis
of
this
confrontation
between
the
defendants
and
the
justice.
mr.
john
j.
dean
i
think
it’s
about
six
and
a
half
weeks
sir,
yes.
the
trial
started
in
november
of
1966
and
concluded
i
think
on
about
december
the
12th
of
1966
and
i
think
there
few
days
that
the
court
took
of
for
procedural
matters
and
other
issues
but
essentially
it
was
a
six-week
trial.
mr.
john
j.
dean
not
the
contempt
trial.
this
was
--
as
i
said
the
case
was
procedurally
confused.
they
were
originally
before
the
court
on
a
prison
breach
and
holding
hostage
in
a
penal
institution.
during
that
trial
in
1966
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
contempts,
these
are
the
contempts
that
are
currently
before
this
court.
mr.
john
j.
dean
that’s
right,
only
with
the
contempt
trial.
what
then
happened
was
that
they
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
which
affirmed
the
conviction.
they
petitioned
this
court
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
which
was
granted.
this
court
heard
the
case
and
in
january
of
1971,
in
an
opinion
by
mr.
justice
douglas
remanded
the
case
back
to
pennsylvania
for
a
public
trial
for
the
words
that
were
used.
the
case
lay
dormant
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
mayberry
was
the
only
petitioner
really
before
the
court
directly,
although
he
under
the
order
seem
to
drag
in
codispoti
and
langnes
with
him.
what
makes
this
case
confusing
now
is
mayberry
is
no
longer
here,
it’s
just
langnes
and
codispoti.
mr.
john
j.
dean
mr.
mayberry
chose
not
to
go
to
this
court.
i
can’t
really
offer
you
a
rationale
explanation
of
that
action,
but
we
now
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
no,
he’s
not
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
dean
yes,
your
honor,
in
the
first
case
that
we
had
he
was
a
sole
party.
mr.
john
j.
dean
yes,
your
honor.
what
then
happened
was
when
the
case
was
remanded
back
in
january
of
1971,
judge
fiok
who
was
the
trial
judge
in
1966
against
whom
the
original
contempts
were
leveled,
on
december
7
of
1971,
almost
a
year
later
issued
a
citation
which
was
to
be
served
by
registered
mail
upon
the
three
defendants
scheduling
a
hearing,
separate
hearings
for
each
of
the
defendants
on
anywhere
from
december
12
to
december
17.
mr.
mayberry
went
the
trial
first
in
front
of
judge
vandervort,
then
mr.
codispoti
went
to
trial
then
mr.
langnes
went
to
trial.
they
had
separate
individual
trials
or
hearings
depending
on
how
you’re
going
to
characterize
it.
mr.
john
j.
dean
mayberry
was
again
adjudicated
in
contempt
of
court
and
sentenced.
mr.
john
j.
dean
no,
your
honor.
what
occurred
in
that
case
was
that
by
the
expedient
of
giving
a
six-month
sentence
and
by
making
them
consecutive,
mayberry
was
again
convicted
on
all
of
the
charges
that
he
was
originally
cited
for
by
judge
fiok
and
given
11
to
22
years
sentence
but
mr.
mayberry
came
up
with
something
like
a
--
i
think
a
four-year
two-month
sentence
was
his
sentence.
mr.
john
j.
dean
he
again
appealed
that
sentences
to
the
other
ones
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
which
this
time
affirmed
pre
curiam
with
judgment
of
contempt.
however,
they
--
one
justice
did
dissent
based
upon
the
united
states
versus
seale
rationale.
at
that
point,
codispoti
and
langnes
petitioned
this
court
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
which
was
granted,
which
is
why
we
are
now
up
here
in
front
of
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
evidently,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
dean
i
was
court-appointed
counsel.
mr.
mayberry
has
refused
to
talk
to
me
during
some
of
these
proceedings
so
i
am
somewhat
hard
pressed
to
give
you
[attempt
to
laughter]
a
viable
rationale
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
he
is
not
in
front
of
the
court.
at
this
time
all
we
have
are
codispoti
and
langnes.
it
is
important
perhaps
to
get
into
some
of
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
because
of
the
arguments
advanced,
all
of
the
trials
of
mayberry,
codispoti,
and
langnes
were
exactly
similar.
in
other
words,
i
don’t
think
there
was
a
substantial
difference
between
one
or
the
other.
mr.
langnes
had
or
mr.
codispoti,
excuse
me,
had
come
in
and
requested
that
counsel
of
his
own
choice
be
there
to
represent
him.
the
court
said
but
where
is
your
counsel
and
the
counsel
was
in
philadelphia
and
the
judge
vandervort
said,
“well,
he’s
not
in
the
courtroom
now,
you
have
a
public
defender,
go
proceed
with
him.”
mr.
codispoti
had
said
that
he
didn’t
have
any
notice
of
this
hearing
really
until
he
was
brought
in
to
pittsburgh,
pennsylvania
the
morning
of
the
trial
that
he
had
written
the
trial
judge,
judge
fiok
twice
after
the
remand
saying,
what
are
you
going
to
do
or
words
to
that
effect
and
had
received
no
reply.
mr.
codispoti
then
requested
a
jury
trial
and
in
exactly
similar
language
that
the
court
had
used
for
langnes
and
mayberry
said,
the
court;
i
regard
this
issue
mr.
codispoti
as
an
issue
between
the
court,
not
any
particular
judge
but
between
the
court
and
you
and
i
think
the
record
should
speak
for
the
court
and
you
can
speak
for
yourself
and
i
am
going
to
refuse
your
motion
for
jury
trial.
evidently,
these
people
had
some
idea
because
they
had
known
what
had
gone
on
before.
mr.
codispoti
then
said,
“well,
i
would
like
some
defense
witnesses
who
were
present
during
the
original
arbitration
between
judge
fiok
and
myself,
present
to
testify
in
my
behalf.”
at
the
second
hearing
he
was
denied
under
these
words
the
court;
i
am
going
to
refuse
your
motion
to
subpoena
witnesses
for
the
reasons
that
i
told
you.
i
think
that
this
is
an
issue
between
the
court
and
you
and
the
record
will
speak
for
the
court
and
you
and
your
counsel
can
speak
for
yourself.
and
this
is
what
happened
in
every
single
trial
that
came
along.
so
with
those
words,
they
were
denied
the
right
to
a
jury
trial,
they
were
denied
the
right
to
present
defense
witnesses,
and
they
were
entitled
to
speak
for
themselves,
the
record
will
speak
for
the
court.
they
weren’t
even
permitted
to
call
the
trial
judge
who
simply
resided
maybe
50
or
65
feet
in
a
courtroom
immediately
adjacent
to
the
courtroom
where
the
trial
was
being
held.
that
brings
us
to
the
issue
here.
they
were
found
and
adjudicated
guilty
on
all
of
these
contempts
of
court.
on
one
of
them,
they
received
two
months
and
on
one
of
the
contempts
charges,
they
had
received
a
sentence
of
six
months.
mr.
codispoti,
for
some
reason
that’s
not
quite
apparent
to
me
was
sentenced
to
a
year
for
one
contempt
and
the
court
has
set
out
in
the
appendix
had
simply
said
we
sentence
to
a
year
for
citation
number
5
or
whatever
it
was.
approximately,
a
month
later
the
court
revised
this
“rough
draft
sentencing”
to
make
it
down
into
six
months.
all
of
the
sentences
ran
consecutively
and
therefore
they
were
imprisoned
approximately
from
three
to
--
two
to
three
years,
give
or
take
a
few
months
one
way
or
the
other.
and
that
brings
us
somewhat
so
through
this
route
in
order
to
a
appreciate
the
issues
here,
the
question
of
when
there
are
--
when
there
is
a
single
trial
for
a
multiple
contempts
that
have
occurred
during
a
particular
trial,
does
the
person’s
right
to
a
jury
trial
depend
upon
the
aggregate
sentence
received,
in
this
case
several
years,
or
does
it
depend
upon
the
individual
sentences
received
namely
a
six-month
sentence
which
is
aggregated
into
a
three-year
sentence.
we
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
when
there
is
one
single
trial
that
the
appropriate
remedy
is
to
look
at
the
penalty
imposed
in
the
total
because
it
makes
little
difference
to
the
man
who
is
sitting
in
jail
to
say,
“oh,
you’re
only
in
jail
for
six
months
but
you’re
in
jail
six
months
10
times,
than
to
say
that
you’re
in
jail
for
five
years.”
it
makes
absolutely
no
difference
to
him
in
regards
to
the
length
of
his
incarceration.
mr.
john
j.
dean
we’re
talking
about
11
to
22
years
sir.
he
was
given
a
one
to
two-year
sentence
on
each
contempt.
mr.
john
j.
dean
no,
your
honor,
not
directly.
the
concluding
words
of
mr.
justice
douglas
were
that
it
was
to
be
remanded
back
for
a
public
trial.
there
was
some
discussion
in
the
lower
court
whether
the
words
public
trial
were
to
be
interpreted
as
to
mean
jury
trial.
the
trial
judge,
judge
vandervort
decided
that
it
did
not
mean
a
jury
trial.
mr.
john
j.
dean
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
be
presumptuous
of
me
to
try
to
impute
the
reasons
for
this
court
as
to
why
they
did
a
particular
action
in
a
particular
case.
i
don’t
think
it
does,
to
answer
your
question
however.
i
don’t
think
it
has
any
direct
significance
because
i
don’t
think
the
problem
was
essentially
before
this
court.
i
would
like
to
think
that
the
words
public
trial
meant
a
trial
by
jury
and
that
the
court
did
not
believe
that
all
of
a
sudden
these
people
were
not
to
have
a
jury
trial
on
these
contempt
charges.
mr.
john
j.
dean
there
was
one
your
honor.
they
were
somewhat
obstreperous
and
one
of
the
defendants
was
given
a
chance
to
recant
and
he
had
cast
impolite
language
upon
the
competency
of
judge
fiok
and
the
judge
asked
him
if
you
wanted
to
--
judge
vandervort
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
recant
as
to
the
mental
ability
of
judge
fiok.
he
did
that
by
saying
that
he
found
somebody
or
perhaps
lesser
mental
ability
than
judge
fiok
which
was
the
present
trial
judge.
[laughter
attempt]
i
don’t
think
that
was
really
the
recantation
that
they
expected
and
he
received
another
six
months
sentence
for
that
slight
outburst.
mr.
john
j.
dean
yes
your
honor,
he
was
sentenced
to
six,
i
believe
it
was
codispoti
was
sentenced
six
months
or
langnes.
i
am
ruling
out
certain
roots
because
the
trials
were
so
similar
adverse
occurred.
to
my
knowledge
and
i
was
present
at
those
trials
or
most
of
those
trials,
only
one
of
them
was
given
an
additional
sentence.
you
see
your
honor,
in
some
sense
as
mr.
codispoti
said
he
had
been
up
there,
he’d
requested
very
politely
this
and
then
it’s
in
page
5
of
our
brief
have
been
denied
his
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
you
mean
within
here
sir?
are
the
request
politely?
mr.
john
j.
dean
or
you
mean
for
jury
trial
and
so
forth?
mr.
john
j.
dean
alright,
on
page
four
of
the
brief,
your
honor
are
the
--
i
am
sorry
appendix
43,
excuse
me
as
where
in
the
appendix
it
would
be
for
mr.
codispoti,
he
starts
up
here.
i
would
say
it
would
be
reasonably
polite
as
a
trial
lawyer
he
had
requested
to
the
jury
trial,
but
the
court
said,
“no,
you
can’t
have
it.”
he
had
then
on
around
pages
45
approximately
at
the
middle
of
the
case
said
that
according
to
baldwin
versus
new
york
and
bloom
versus
illinois
and
duncan
that
he
would
like
a
jury
trial
and
that
he’d
be
given
14
years
and
he
thinks
that
it
was
relatively
serious
crime
at
that
particular
point.
the
court
said
that
it
is
just
between
you
and
the
court.
he
then
asked
for
witnesses
and
i
assumed
that
that
was
a
relatively
polite
request,
appeared
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
for
me,
at
least
nothing
that
would
certainly
shock
the
contents
of
the
court
to
disrupt
these
procedures.
what
then
did
occur
is
we
have
an
evaluation
of
the
trial
judge
at
least
if
he
had
been
polite
because
on
page
47
mr.
codispoti
states
to
the
court
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
well,
your
honor,
perhaps
that
--
alright
i
will
not
say
that’s
the
most
polite
way.
polite
i
meant
in
response
to
your
question
of
failure
to
use
obscene
language.[attempt
to
laughter]
the
language
got
to
be
a
little
bit
probably
make
a
stevedore
blush
after
a
while.
mr.
john
j.
dean
but
it
any
event,
he
does
say
here
on
page
47,
there
is
one
thing
and
this
is
mr.
codispoti
saying,
there
is
one
and
this
is
after
he
has
been
denied
this,
“there’s
one
thing
i
want
to
make
clear.
i
came
in
this
courtroom
trying
to
be
respectful
right”
and
the
trial
judge
answers,
“you
have
been”
which
until
that
point
mr.
codispoti’s
behavior
will
perhaps
not
within
the
standards
of
conduct
one
would
expect
from
an
attorney
had
not
been
the
obstreperous
that
had
attended
these
other
litigations
in
court.
and
he
says,
“now
you
that
know
i
have
90
years
and
really
another
10
to
20
years
on
top
of
a
90
years
sentence,
the
words
are
to
the
effect
is
not
going
to
certainly
sway
him
one
way
or
the
other.
i
think
it’s
important
to
understand
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
yes,
sir.
that’s
what
i
meant
by
saying
that
he
was
relatively
polite
in
the
beginning.
unfortunately,
that
language
did
attend
most
of
these
proceedings.
this
gentleman,
i
think
has
spent
i
would
say
consecutive
25
years
in
prison.
perhaps,
in
the
some
instances
it
is
strange.
this
entire
group
has
started
out
rebelling
against
prison
authority.
mayberry
was
incarcerated
at
age
12
for
being
a
dependent
neglected
child
and
he
has
never
escaped
from
the
penal
authority
sentence
since
he
has
been
engaged
in
one
continuing
arbitration
after
another.
in
some
sense
in
trying
these
people
for
contempt
of
court
case
would
almost
be
like
beating
a
masochist
with
whips
for
punishment.
i
mean,
you
bring
these
people
into
a
courtroom
and
unfortunately
you’re
giving
them
an
opportunity
to
go
on
and
do
things
which
they
don’t
really
have.
mr.
john
j.
dean
your
honor,
if
it
were
my
personal
opinion,
i
feel
they
are
very
sick
individuals.
i
don’t
think
that
their
conduct
is
in
anyway
justifiable.
i
don’t
think
it’s
really
the
conduct
that
one
will
expect
of
a
rational
human
being.
i
think
these
people
have
an
extreme
problem.
i
don’t
think
the
legal
system
is
really
within
the
system
of
punishment
and
imprisonment
the
way
to
effectively
handle
these
individuals
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
in
the
judge
vandervort
proceedings
what
you’re
talking
about,
i
thought
the
original
you’re
talking
about
the
judge
fiok
proceedings.
mr.
john
j.
dean
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
eventually,
the
defendants
were
excluded
from
the
courtroom
in
the
course
of
these
trials.
mr.
john
j.
dean
not
to
my
direct
knowledge
your
honor,
no.
i
am
somewhat
hazy
on
the
rational
that
judge
vandervort
did
use
to
determine
whether
or
not
he
could
exclude
the
defendants
but
effectively
he
did
exclude
them.
he
had
them
placed
in
an
ante
room
with
a
loudspeaker
so
they
could
hear
what
was
going
on
for
the
entire
proceedings.
but
if
i
may,
the
situation
that
we
would
like
to
say,
is
that
under
situations
such
as
this
particular
case
that
where
people
do
receive
a
cumulative
sentence
that
there
are
several
strong
policy
reasons
why
this
court
should
demand
a
jury
trial
in
an
aggregated
sentence.
generally,
the
reasons
for
petty
cases
not
being
required
to
have
a
jury
trial
is
maybe
that
they’re
too
small
to
really
worry
about
that
a
couple
of
days,
we
can’t
worry
about
judicial
economy.
we
have
to
make
sure
the
court
schedule
flows
well.
but
as
i
suggested
to
the
court
earlier
that
has
a
relatively
hollow
ring
to
man
incarcerated
for
three
years.
there
was
also
the
problem
that
generally
the
power
of
the
court
to
punish
direct
criminal
contempts
that
occurred
incur
in
front
of
it
can
be
grounded
in
a
prophylactic
rule
that
at
least
it
will
begin
to
restore
order
to
the
courtroom
in
an
abstractor
situation
because
of
the
immediacy
of
punishment
it’s
the
act
that
is
deterrent
to
future
conduct.
but
in
this
particular
case
or
in
any
case
where
the
individual
contempt
problems
are
accumulated
and
then
tried
subsequent
or
termination
of
the
main
judicial
proceeding,
that
prophylactic
rational
has
no
longer
any
viability.
finally,
the
real
problem
in
this
is
the
problem
of
judicial
abuse.
i
was
sitting
down
talking
with
some
lawyers
and
they
said
it
to
me
that
ours
is
probably
the
only
profession
in
the
world
where
a
trial
lawyer
can
be
put
in
jail
for
being
late
for
work
because
if
you
come
late
in
front
of
the
court,
its
well
within
the
competency
of
the
judge
to
put
you
in
jail
and
there’s
probably
no
other
single
profession
where
that
penalty
is
imposed
for
being
late.
mr.
john
j.
dean
[laughter
attempt]
perhaps
in
the
military
but
often
times
do
not
in
the
military
voluntarily,
but
at
least
you
haven’t
been
in
the
past
that
was
not
a
matter
of
choice
being
in
there.
mr.
john
j.
dean
that’s
probably
true
at
this
point
at
least
most
of
them
are.
however,
would
surrender
that
necessarily
get
out
their
discretion.
but
the
problem
was
that
these
people
viewed
codispoti,
mayberry
and
langnes
have
viewed
the
prison
authorities
as
you
stated,
mr.
chief
justice,
are
working
together,
being
in
a
league
against
that
what
they
want
is
some
appearance
of
impartiality
and
as
the
court
can
tell
from
the
way
that
these
proceedings
went
codispoti’s
frustration
was
obviously
eminent
in
the
language
that
we
wrote
from
the
appendix
47,
that
his
problem
was
that
he
wanted
a
fair
trial
and
exactly
the
same
thing
happened
in
everybody’s
trial.
they
asked
for
the
jury,
it's
denied.
they
asked
for
witnesses,
it's
denied.
they
asked
for
counsel,
it’s
denied.
they
are
told
to
go
to
trial
with
appointed-counsel
right
now
and
at
least
i
am
not
saying
that
a
jury
may
have
arrived
at
different
determination
than
the
trial
judge
did.
i
don’t
think
that’s
really
a
central
issue
here.
it’s
not
a
question
legitimately
before
this
court,
but
what
the
problem
is
that
at
least
if
there
was
a
jury
interposed
between
the
judiciary
who
happens
to
be
not
only
the
prosecutor,
not
only
the
person
who
presented
the
charges,
not
only
the
trier
of
fact
but
also
the
imposer
of
sentence,
to
at
least
get
a
third
party
in
there
in
the
fact-finding
position
has
a
lot
to
recommend
it.
and
also,
it’s
very
difficult
to
insulate
one
judge
who
was
worked
with
another
judge
say
for
20
years
and
say
that
he
is
going
to
be
the
completely
impartial
arbiter
of
dispenser
of
justice
that
our
american
legal
system
tends
to
look
upon
the
judiciary.
mr.
john
j.
dean
yes,
your
honor,
i
did
not
argue
mayberry
originally
before
this
court,
but
it
is
my
understanding
that
was
argued
and
that’s
what
was
done.
it
was
sent
back
for
a
trial
in
front
of
another
judge
which
was
done
in
this
particular
case.
what
i’m
suggesting
however,
is
that
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
another
judge
and
the
jury
is
what
we
would
like
in
this
particular
instance.
there
is
another
question
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
no.
which
mayberry
opinion
you’re
referring
to?
mr.
john
j.
dean
say
anything
about
this
particular
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
dean
a
jury
trial?
mr.
john
j.
dean
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
dean
no,
not
to
my
knowledge,
they
did
not
say
that
there
was
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
--
it
was
not
to
be
a
jury
trial
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
john
j.
dean
i
am
sorry
--
i
understand
exact
the
exact
thrust
of
your
question.
mr.
john
j.
dean
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
dean
yes
well
that
it
varied
among
the
individual
[voice
overlap].
mr.
john
j.
dean
your
honor
he
can
do
that.
i
don’t
think
that’s
a
rational
that
you’re
going
to
encourage.
mr.
john
j.
dean
obviously,
he
could
do
that,
your
honor.
i
mean
there’s
no
two
ways.
the
problem
with
the
six
months
aggregation
rule
is
that
you
have
one
may
be
very
serious
contempt
charge
weighed
with
several
minor
charges
and
the
court
instead
of
affording
a
jury
trial
in
the
series
contempt
charge
can
allocate
the
total
sentence
into
six
months
pieces
apart
and
thereby
effectively
deprive
a
person
to
jury
trial.
i
do
not
think
the
judiciary
should
be
encouraged,
the
lower
court
judiciary
to
be
encourage
to
deprive
people
from
jury
trials
so
that
lift
the
views
of
consecutive
[voice
overlap].
mr.
john
j.
dean
i
will
just
--
i
would
think
that
would
be
not
acceptable
approach
to
the
problem.
your
honor,
if
i
can
i
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
john
j.
dean
not
of
that
particular
time,
no
your
honor.
there
is
no
applicable
statute
governing
back
an
obstruction
of
justice.
mr.
john
j.
dean
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
what
this
shows
is
that
somewhat
high
miracle
characterization
they
can
attend
our
contempt
analysis
here
because
one
thing
that
--
i
think
has
emerged
in
regards
both
of
the
presentations
here
today
is
that
when
this
case
originally
came
up
to
the
court,
the
chief
justice
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
had
termed
his
conduct
outrageous.
mr.
justice
douglas
of
this
court
termed
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
a
shock
to
those
raised
in
the
western
tradition
of
justice.
he
had
received
11
to
22
years
sentence
and
all
of
a
sudden
when
he
comes
back
for
a
trial
what
has
become
at
least
according
to
the
characterizations
of
the
our
new
original
trial
judge
the
justice
of
the
or
the
chief
justice
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
and
the
justice
of
this
court
as
outrageous
has
been
transformed
into
a
petty
contempt.
and
i
feel
that
that
type
of
labeling
putting
on
these
are
crime
is
what
brings
to
fore
the
problem
of
looking
solely
to
the
actual
sentence
received
on
each
crime
rather
than
the
aggregate
sentence
because
by
looking
at
the
aggregate
sentence,
the
effectiveness,
the
total
problem
that
gets
up
here
is
well
before
the
court.
mr.
john
j.
dean
i
argued
the
case
your
honor
in
front
of
the
court.
that
issue
was
raised.
i
had
cited
the
court’s
previous
opinions
of
two
of
the
justices
who
were
currently
on
the
court
in
both
instances
and
i
can
give
you
no
possible
explanation.
mr.
john
j.
dean
that
bloom
was
not
retroactive?
mr.
john
j.
dean
i
just
don’t
think
that’s
a
correct
legal
reasoning.
mr.
john
j.
dean
i
think
it
has
to
be
retroactive
because
it
was
such
a
fundamental
right
--
mr.
john
j.
dean
well,
let
me
say
this,
i
used
the
wrong
the
choice
of
words
there.
i
don’t
think
retroactivity
is
a
real
problem
first
of
all
because
the
trial
was
occurring
subsequent
to
that.
i
don’t
think
retroactivity
really
gets
in
to
this
issue
but
even
assuming
that
retroactivity
did
get
into
the
issue,
the
test
of
this
court
has
used
to
see
whether
a
constitutional
right
shall
be
applied
retroactively
are
usually
would
it
result
in
changes
in
the
police
procedures,
would
it
result
in
considerable
disruption,
would
it
result
in
releasing
other
criminals
or
things
like
this.
and
i
don’t
think
any
of
the
tests
under
the
linkletter
approach
have
any
negative
value
to
stop
this
from
being
applied
if
you
want
to
use
that
characterization
retroactively.
i
think
it
could
easily
be
applied
retroactively.
it
is
my
understanding
of
pennsylvania
law
that
we
were
require
jury
trial
for
all
crimes.
we
just
have
a
new
felony
code.
before
we
had
felonies
and
misdemeanors,
we
now
have
them
graded
felonies
and
graded
misdemeanors.
any
misdemeanor
requires
a
jury
trial
in
our
court.
mr.
john
j.
dean
there’s
absolutely
no
maximum
sentence
on
contempt
of
court.
mr.
john
j.
dean
yes,
the
judge
is
the
one
who
has
absolute
discretion
over
the
sentencing
and
absent
a
very
clear
abuse
of
discretion
our
appellate
courts
will
not
review
a
sentencing
judge's
determination.
