perhaps
in

justice
byron
r.
white
i
have
most
of
mine
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
--
there’s
no
issue
here
--
let’s
assume
that
there
had
been
one
sentence
for
a
contempt,
only
one
count
of
contempt
and
the
sentence
of
a
two
years
for
it
,
would
he
had
been
entitled
to
a
jury
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
because
the
second
the
trial
to
place
after
bloom?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
in
1966
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
a
different
--
but
jury
trial
is
a
question
about
the
procedures
at
trial
not
about
the
procedure
before
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
1966?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
were
these
defendants
tried
twice
for
contempt?
is
that
was
first
sentence
set
aside,
was
the
first
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
went
back
to
the
trial
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
that
was
a
new
proceeding
to
the
judgment
that
have
been
vacated?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judgment
was
vacated.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
suppose
that
the
judgment
was
vacated,
the
judgment
is
conviction
would
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
the
new
judge
had
to
find
whether
again
he
had
to
make
determination
again
whether
he
had
been
held
and
whether
he
had
committed
contempt.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
was
a
new
trial
court
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
at
that
point
the
bloom
i
guess
they
only
have
been
decided
prior
to
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
question
was
then
in
for
carrying
out
this
proceeding
must
i
proceed
consistently
with
bloom?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
contention
is
that
you
need
not
have
a
jury
trial
because
no
particular
contempt
do
more
than
a
six
months
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
still
have
an
open-ended
--
is
it
still
open-ended
on
contempt?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
codispoti
against
pennsylvania,
we
are
also
dealing
with
a
judgment
for
criminal
contempt.
the
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
here
the
contemnors
were
two
defendants
at
the
criminal
trial
who
were
acting
as
their
own
attorney
and
who
were
found
guilty
of
criminal
contempt
after
trial
for
several
acts
that
occurred
during
the
trial.
we
hold
that
in
the
case
of
post-verdict
adjudications
of
various
acts
of
contempt,
committed
during
trial,
the
sixth
amendment
requires
a
jury
trial,
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
require
a
jury
trial,
if
the
sentences
imposed
aggregate
more
than
six
months,
even
though
no
sentence
for
more
than
six
months
is
imposed
for
any
one
act
of
contempt.
we
accordingly
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
which
had
held
that
the
jury
trial
was
not
required.
i
have
