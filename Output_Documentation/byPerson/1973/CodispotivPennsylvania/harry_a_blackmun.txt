aren’t

justice
harry
a.

and
did
the

on
this

justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
that
there
is
any
significance
in
our
failure

discuss
it
at
all?
justice
harry

incidentally,
were
there
any
further
contempts

during
the

well,
i
was
looking
at
the

mr.
eberhardt,
the
defendant
part
on
the
facts
do
you
think
--
suppose
this
trial
went
a
long
for
two
days
and
then
for
good
reasons
it
was
recessed
for
three
and
the
contemptuous
cussing
of
the
court
if
you
will
took
place
at
the
first
segment
and
then
again
at
the
second,
does
it
disturb
your
sense
of
justice
that
that
might
be
two
separate
contempts?
