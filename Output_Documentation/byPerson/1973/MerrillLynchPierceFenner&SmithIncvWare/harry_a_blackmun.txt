justice
harry

this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
california
of
the
first
appellate
district.
it
is
here
because
of
tension
between
certain
rules
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
on
the
one
hand,
and
some
california
statues
on
the
other.
merrill
lynch
is
a
securities
broker
and
the
member
corporation
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
mr.
ware
in
1958
entered
merrill
lynch's
employee
as
an
account
executive
in
merrill
lynch's
san
francisco
office.
he
had
worked
there
for
almost
11
years
when
in
1969
he
terminated
that
employment
voluntarily
and
went
to
work
in
a
similar
capacity
with
a
san
francisco
competitor.
since,
well
before
mr.
ware
began
his
employment
with
merrill
lynch,
merrill
lynch
had
in
fact
a
noncontributory
profit-sharing
plan
for
its
employees
in
the
united
states.
under
that
plan
an
employee
obtains
both
vested
and
unvested
units.
the
plan,
however,
provides
that
a
participant
who
voluntarily
terminates
his
employment
and
engages
in
a
competitive
occupation
shall
forfeit
all
rights
to
the
benefits
due
him
under
the
plan.
when
mr.
ware
quit,
the
governing
committee
determined
that
he
had
entered
competitive
employment
and
his
interest
in
the
plan
was
forfeited
accordingly.
mr.
ware,
thereupon
this
suit
in
the
california
state
court
against
merrill
lynch.
he
sought
a
declaration
that
the
forfeiture
provision
of
the
plan
was
illegal
under
california
law
when
the
merrill
lynch
was
obligated
to
pay
him
all
vested
that's
credit
to
his
account.
california
has
a
statue
providing
that
every
contract
by
which
anyone
is
restrained
from
engaging
in
the
lawful
business
is
void.
it
has
still
another
statue
providing
that
an
action
to
collect
unpaid
wages
maybe
maintain
in
that
state
without
regard
to
the
existence
of
any
private
agreement
to
arbitrate.
in
its
answer
to
mr.
ware's
complaint,
merrill
lynch
alleged
that
the
forfeiture
provision
of
the
plan
was
valid
under
new
york
law,
that
the
plan
itself
provided
that
is
should
be
construed
according
to
new
york
law,
that
ware
agreed
to
this
when
he
went
to
work
for
merrill
lynch,
that
he
signed
an
employment
form
prepared
by
and
approved
by
the
new
york
stock
exchange
by
which
he
has
specifically
agreed
that
any
controversy
with
a
member
firm
would
be
settled
by
arbitration
and
that
ware
sole
remedy
would
therefore
was
by
arbitration
in
new
york
and
not
by
a
law
suit
in
california.
merrill
lynch
therefore
petitioned
the
california
court
for
an
order
compelling
arbitration.
this
was
denied.
on
appeal
that
judgment
was
affirmed,
the
court
holding
that
the
forfeiture
clause
and
the
pension
plan
was
invalid
under
california
law
when
applied
to
california
residents
and
further
holding
that
ware
had
the
right
to
assert
his
claim
in
court
despite
the
existence
of
the
agreement
arbitrate.
the
issue
presented
to
us
thus
has
to
do
with
the
extent
to
which
authority
delegated
under
a
federal
regulatory
statue
preempts
the
state
law
to
the
contrary.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
have
reviewed
the
silver
case,
decided
here
in
1963
and
which
we
feel
bears
upon
the
present
case
to
review
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934
has
amended
regulating
the
business
of
securities
and
brokers
and
dealers,
and
have
reviewed
the
history
and
specific
provisions
of
the
california
statues
urged
upon
us
here.
from
all
this
we
conclude
that
the
pertinent
rule
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
does
not
preempt
contrary
state
law,
that
it
cannot
be
categorized
as
part
of
a
need
for
uniform
national
regulation,
but
there
is
applicable
here
the
usual
principle
that
federal
regulation
of
the
field
of
commerce
shall
not
be
deemed
preempt
to
the
state
regulatory
power
in
the
absence
of
persuasive
reasons,
that
the
application
of
the
california
statues
here
would
not
unduly
burden
the
interstate
commerce.
from
this
it
follows
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeal
is
to
be
affirmed
and
it
is
affirmed.
i
am
authorized
to
state
that
mr.
justice
stewart
took
no
part
in
the
decision
of
this
case.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun

me
mr.
orrick.
justice
harry

the

justice
harry

and
i

from

is
that
right?
justice
harry
a.

that
is

appellate
district.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
at
least
one
judge
was
common
to

panels.

harry

and
we
decided
it
months
apart.
justice
harry

ware
or
frame?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
california
of
the
first
appellate
district.
it
is
here
because
of
tension
between
certain
rules
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
on
the
one
hand,
and
some
california
statues
on
the
other.
merrill
lynch
is
a
securities
broker
and
the
member
corporation
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
mr.
ware
in
1958
entered
merrill
lynch's
employee
as
an
account
executive
in
merrill
lynch's
san
francisco
office.
he
had
worked
there
for
almost
11
years
when
in
1969
he
terminated
that
employment
voluntarily
and
went
to
work
in
a
similar
capacity
with
a
san
francisco
competitor.
since,
well
before
mr.
ware
began
his
employment
with
merrill
lynch,
merrill
lynch
had
in
fact
a
noncontributory
profit-sharing
plan
for
its
employees
in
the
united
states.
under
that
plan
an
employee
obtains
both
vested
and
unvested
units.
the
plan,
however,
provides
that
a
participant
who
voluntarily
terminates
his
employment
and
engages
in
a
competitive
occupation
shall
forfeit
all
rights
to
the
benefits
due
him
under
the
plan.
when
mr.
ware
quit,
the
governing
committee
determined
that
he
had
entered
competitive
employment
and
his
interest
in
the
plan
was
forfeited
accordingly.
mr.
ware,
thereupon
this
suit
in
the
california
state
court
against
merrill
lynch.
he
sought
a
declaration
that
the
forfeiture
provision
of
the
plan
was
illegal
under
california
law
when
the
merrill
lynch
was
obligated
to
pay
him
all
vested
that's
credit
to
his
account.
california
has
a
statue
providing
that
every
contract
by
which
anyone
is
restrained
from
engaging
in
the
lawful
business
is
void.
it
has
still
another
statue
providing
that
an
action
to
collect
unpaid
wages
maybe
maintain
in
that
state
without
regard
to
the
existence
of
any
private
agreement
to
arbitrate.
in
its
answer
to
mr.
ware's
complaint,
merrill
lynch
alleged
that
the
forfeiture
provision
of
the
plan
was
valid
under
new
york
law,
that
the
plan
itself
provided
that
is
should
be
construed
according
to
new
york
law,
that
ware
agreed
to
this
when
he
went
to
work
for
merrill
lynch,
that
he
signed
an
employment
form
prepared
by
and
approved
by
the
new
york
stock
exchange
by
which
he
has
specifically
agreed
that
any
controversy
with
a
member
firm
would
be
settled
by
arbitration
and
that
ware
sole
remedy
would
therefore
was
by
arbitration
in
new
york
and
not
by
a
law
suit
in
california.
merrill
lynch
therefore
petitioned
the
california
court
for
an
order
compelling
arbitration.
this
was
denied.
on
appeal
that
judgment
was
affirmed,
the
court
holding
that
the
forfeiture
clause
and
the
pension
plan
was
invalid
under
california
law
when
applied

and
further
holding
that
ware
had
the
right
to
assert
his
claim
in
court
despite
the
existence
of
the
agreement
arbitrate.
the
issue
presented
to
us
thus
has
to
do
with
the
extent
to
which
authority
delegated
under
a
federal
regulatory
statue
preempts
the
state

to
the

and

the

of

from
all

we
conclude
that

does
not
preempt

state

that
it
cannot
be

i
