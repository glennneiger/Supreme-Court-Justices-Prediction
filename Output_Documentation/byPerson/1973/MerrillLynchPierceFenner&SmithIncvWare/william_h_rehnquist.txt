justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
orrick,
why
is
it
important
in
your
argument
that
the
contract
provider
should
be
interpreted
according
to
the
laws
of
new
york?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
see
what
are
the
arguments
you
make
here
about
in
effect
federal
preemption,
if
they
didn't
prevail
as
you
make
them,
why
it
would
make
it
improper
for
california
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
to
reject
new
york
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
not
enforceable
under
the
state
arbitration
act.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
it's
not
enforceable
under
the
state
arbitration
act.
does
it?
because
the
california
court
of
appeal
ruled
against
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
actually
a
question
whether
it
can
be
enforced
against
the
will
of
the
forum
state.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
suggesting
then
that
if
pacific
coast
exchange
had
a
rule
like
the
new
york
stock
exchange
does,
it
could
not
enforce
it
under
merrill
lynch's
theory
because
it
is
physically
located
in
california?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr
barton,
is
this
motion
to
arbitrate
that
the
petitioner
filed
in
response
to
your
complaint
in
the
superior
court,
is
that
an
independent
proceeding
under
california
law
or
is
it
just
a
part
of
the
defense
raised
to
your
claim
for
wages?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
wasn't
what
happened.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
actually
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeal
isn't
a
final
disposition
of
this
case,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
the
california
court
of
appeal
disposition
were
followed
here,
the
case
would
go
back
to
the
superior
court
for
trial
to
the
court
on
your
client's
compliant.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
that
important
federal
policy?
is
it
uniformity
or
is
it
preference
for
arbitration?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah
if
new
york
were
to
change
its
law
tomorrow,
so
that
its
law
were
the
same
is
california's.
under
your
theory,
that
arbitration
rule
couldn't
be
enforced
anywhere?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
so,
so
new
york
can
set
it
not
as
important
federal
preference
for
arbitration
under
your
own
theory.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
was
something
you
raised
as
a
defense
when
you
were
brought
into
court
by
mr.
barton'
client,
isn't
it?
it
wasn't
a
separate
action
that
you
brought
to
compel
arbitration.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
orrick,
why
is
