mr.
joseph
c.
barton
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it's
important
for
this
case,
perspective
so
that
the
court
can
consider
that
the
narrow
issues
that
are
presented
here.
this
case
is
really
about
100
or
more
former
employees
of
merrill
lynch
who
resided
in
california.
and
who
worked
for
their
employer
with
integrity
and
with
competency.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
in
california,
right.
and
by
reason
of
their
employment
and
by
reason
of
contributing
to
the
success
of
merill
lynch
are
entitled
to
be
paid
to
earn
wages.
now
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
the
profit-sharing
that
we
are
talking
about
is
wages.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
i
believe
petitioner
stipulated
to
the
definition
of
wages
as
authoritatively
construed
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
wise
v.
southern
pacific.
so
they
are
asking
that
they
be
paid
their
lawfully
approved
wages.
now
this
case
is
not
about
any
individuals
who
have
violated
any
rules
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange,
any
regulations
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
the
determination
of
the
class,
your
honor
was
limited
to
those
individuals
who
by
reason
of
one
fact,
they
went
to
work
with
a
competitor
where
they
opened
a
competing
business
were
denied
their
profit-sharing
rights.
there
is
nothing
in
the
case.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
interpretation
of
business
and
professions
code
section
16,600
forecloses
that
consideration
because
it
states
on
its
very
face
that
any
restraint,
and
there
is
a
different
set
of
laws
your
honor
in
california
that
applied
to
customer
lists
and
confidential
information.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well
your
honor.
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
no,
i
don't
think
that's
the
question
your
honor.
arbitration
is
not
mandated
by
any
rule
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
as
amicus
has
pointed
out
in
this
brief
nor
is
it
required
by
any--
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
filed
amicus
brief
in
the
case
and
it's
their
position
that
the
rule
is
not
required
by
any
regulation,
any
legislations
enacted
by
congress
in
the
securities
and
exchange
act
particularly
and
it's
not
required
by
any
rule
or
regulations
promulgated
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well
your
honor,
you
are
asking
about
a
question
about
new
york
law.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well
and
according
to
the
case
that
i
have
cited
to
my
brief.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
it
would
not
have
been
enforced
your
honor,
because
it
concerns
a
matter
of
illegality
which
is
unenforceable
in
the
new
york
courts
pursuant
to
the
decision
of
the
highest
court,
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
why
is
it
new
york
law
because
the
number
one,
your
honor,
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
california
courts
based
on
california
law
by
the
petitioner
and
the
petitioner
asked
for
interpretation
of
the
re
1
form
and
rule
347b.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
(inaudible)
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well,
the
nexus
of
the
compliant
your
honor,
was
about
the
forfeiture
provision
in
a
profit-sharing
plan
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
securities.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
yes,
it
did
your
honor,
as
to
one
little
area.
we
have
got
an
exception.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well
that's
the
specific
question
but
the
general
question.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
yes
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
as
to
wage
dispute.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
that's
correct
your
honor.
as
to
wage
disputes.
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
was
valid
in
new
york.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
excuse
me,
your
honor.
there
has
been
no
definition
yet
in
legislative
history
of
the
act
of
what
located
means.
now
i
submit
your
honor,
that
new
york
stock
exchange
is
physically
located
in
new
york.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
alright.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
as
the
matter
would
be
decided
under
new
york
state
law,
new
york
state
law
would
determine
where
the
arbitration
would---
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
i
don't
believe
that
new
york
state
law
is
contrary
in
outcome,
i
believe
it
would
be
the
same
result.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
at
the
conclusion
of
yesterday's
session,
the
court
had
addressed
itself
to
the
6
(c)
argument
concerning
the
application
of
state
law.
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
in
their
amicus
brief
files
in
the
osmosis
of
the
solicitor
general
considered
that
very
argument
made
by
the
petitioner,
and
stated
on
page
9
of
its
brief
that
there
is
no
basis
for
suggesting
that
rule
347
(b)
was
required
to
implement
the
literal
language
of
the
act
or
any
commission
rule.
it
further
concluded
that
the
application
of
california
law
was
proper
in
this
case
and
urged
affirmance
of
the
california
court
decision.
i
would
like
to
point
out
regarding
section
6
(c)
that
it
specifically
provides
that
any
rule
enacted
by
any
exchange
must
conform
to
the
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
securities
exchange
act
as
well
as
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
that
this
court
has
held
in
silver
v.
new
york
stock
exchange
that
the
rule
of
an
exchange
may
be
judicially
invalidated
as
being
beyond
the
great
purposes
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
i
submit
that
rule,
that
28
(c)
and
rule
347
(b)
as
adopted
by
the
new
york
stock
exchange
is
a
stipulation,
that's
in
the
meaning
of
section
78
cca
of
the
act
and
is
void
by
reason
there
of.
moreover,
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
grant
of
judicial
authority
that
congress
gave
the
courts
in
section
27
of
the
act
which
would
be
15
u.s.c.
78aa
and
that
provides
that
the
district
courts
of
the
united
states
shall
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
violations
of
this
chapter
with
the
rules
and
regulations
they
are
under.
in
addition,
rule
347
(b)
is
inconsistent
with
the
provisions
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
since
admittedly,
it
is
an
agreement
which
concerns
interstate
commerce
and
which
is
a
part
of
the
employment
contract.
as
this
court
noted
in
the
prima
paint
decision,
the
federal
arbitration
act
was
not
meant
to
apply
to
contracts
of
employment
between
parties
of
an
equal
bargaining
strength.
justice
black
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case
spelled
out
the
legislative
intent
behind
the
federal
arbitration
act,
and
that
was
that
it
was
not
meant
to
apply
to
contracts
of
employment.
now
both
this
court
and
silver
and
the
senate
subcommittee,
the
securities
--
the
subcommittee
on
securities
in
its
extensive
analysis
of
the
functioning
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
concluded
that
judicial
review
was
necessary
regarding
the
self
regulatory
powers
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
i
would
like
to
observe
at
this
point
that
it
is
not
the
new
york
stock
exchange
which
is
a
party
to
this
lawsuit
but
rather
a
private
corporation
that
came
into
existence
by
virtue
of
state
law
and
that
merrill
lynch,
like
being
a
member
of
the0
new
york
stock
exchange
is
also
a
member
of
the
pacific
coast
stock
exchange
which
is
physically
located
in
california.
now
if
congress
meant
physical
location
in
section
6
c,
it
would
lead
to
disunity
in
decision
because
there
are
many
stock
exchanges
located
throughout
the
country
which
are
not
in
new
york
and
that
would
give
a
stock
exchange
moreover,
the
opportunity
to
physically
locate
itself
in
a
state
whose
laws
are
favorable
to
its
policies
and
thereby
effectively
emasculate
the
laws
of
49
other
states.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
yes,
i
submit
that
would
be
correct
under
one
rationale.
i
believe
that
congress
intended,
by
location
to
mean
the
application
of
those
laws
of
a
state
which
have
significant
interest
in
the
case,
such
as
california
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
your
honor,
the
pacific
coast
stock
exchange
does
have
rules
concerning
arbitration
which
are
very
similar
to
article
8,
section
1
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
constitution
which
provides
in
essence
that
a
member,
merrill
lynch
in
this
case
cannot
compel
beyond
member
to
arbitrate.
that
choice
is
given
to
the
non-member,
if
he
willingly
wishes
to
invoke
arbitration
and
the
rationale
behind
that
distinction
is
that
obviously
merrill
lynch
has
voice
in
the
exchange
rules
which
an
employee
does
not
have,
so
they
do
not
have
equal
bargaining
strength.
so
they
give
the
non-number
the
option
to
request
arbitration.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
if
the
employee
demands
it?
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
yes,
i
think
that
if
the
employee
demands
it
that
would
be
an
exception.
the
application
would
be--
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
section
229
of
the
california
labor
code.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
is
your
honor
referring
to
the
arbitration
process?
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well,
your
honor,
it
is
not
my
opinion
that
the
arbitration
clause
of
the
rule
was
made
for
the
benefit
the
employee
but
rather
to
benefit
the
members
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
because
the
employee
would
be
compelled
to
arbitrate
before
what
i
consider
a
less
than
impartial
panel.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
yes,
well,
your
honor.
when
there
is
a
--
i
was
to
say,
a
body
of
decision
that
indicates
that
an
individual
may
not
waive
a
law
inactive
for
his
benefit,
that
represents
public
policy.
i
would
say
that
the
california
courts
would
have
to
consider
in
a
factual
context
whether
or
not
--.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well,
the
employee
could
waive
it,
your
honor,
but
whether
the
california
courts
would
recognize
that
waiver
is
a
different
question.
and
i
should
also
point
out
that
rule
347
(b)
does
conflict.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
in
that
context,
your
honor,
they
would
not,
unless
the
employer
moves
the
court
to
compel
that
the
matter
not
be
arbitrated
but
go
to
court.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
that
is
not
permitted
under
california
law,
your
honor.
it
is
the
--.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
correct
your
honor.
if
the
employees
submitted
to
arbitration,
and
the
employer
rejected
that
request,
the
employer
would
then
be
in
the
position
of
going
to
court
to
avoid
arbitration,
the
issue
that
would
arise
in
that
context,
and
i
guess
it
could
also
rise
in
the
context
where
both
parties
have
submitted
the
arbitration
and
then
after
the
arbitration,
a
word
was
made
the
employee
being
dissatisfied
with
it,
would
petition
the
courts.
but
under
that
circumstance,
your
honor,
the
californian
courts
would
not
consider
that
objection
as
i
understand
existing
california
law.
i
should
also
--.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
that's
correct,
your
honor.
he
is
bound,
by
since
229,
as
the
states
on
this
space
is
not
compulsory.
it
does
not
say
must.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
your
honor,
under
california
law
it
could
be
either
an
independent
action
or
it
could
be
part
of
a
lawsuit.
there
are
situations
arising
under
california
law
where
you
may
go
in
the
court
on
just
a
petition
to
arbitrate.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
that
is
not
what
happened.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well,
your
honor
under
california
law
it
isn't.
it
established
the
law
of
the
cases
for
the
legality
of
the
forfeiture
provision.
that
is
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
there
are
other
issues
that
remain
to
be
decided
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
that's
correct,
your
honor.
however,
in
all
fairness,
i
should
note
that
if
the
court
consider
arbitration
to
be
an
outcome
determinative,
as
was
indicated
in
the
bernhard
decision,
then
that
part
of
the
california
decision
would
be
final.
i
should
also
like
to
know
your
honor
that
if
i
understood
counsel's
opening
argument,
he
indicated
that
the
profit-sharing
plan
by
virtue
of
article
18.1,
which
is
noted
at
page
41
appendix,
specifically
stated
the
profit-sharing
plan
was
not
to
be
construed
as
part
of
the
employment
contract,
and
i
submit
under
that
theory
then
rule
347(b)
would
have
no
application
in
this
case,
because
it
specifically
relates
to
employment
disputes.
and
by
the
functioning
of
article
18.1,
it
would
be
excluded
from
the
application
of
rule
347(b).
now
concerning
counsel's
statement
that
respondents
--
some
have
been
guilty
of
forum
shopping,
i
submit
that
is
not
accurate.
now
each
and
every
respondent
is
a
citizen
or
resident
of
the
state
of
california.
all
they
have
done
is
petitioned
their
own
state
courts
or
decision
regarding
this
dispute.
they
have
not
sought
to
go
outside
their
home
state,
for
example
nevada
or
wyoming
to
forum
shop.
this
is
not
a
case
of
forum
shopping.
now
the
policy
of
california
is
spelled
out
in
several
cases.
california
courts
deemed
in
a
matter
of
important
strong
public
policy
considering
the
right
of
the
wager
into
to
all
lawfully
approved
wages.
in
this
context,
i
would
like
to
note
that
although
technically
merrill
lynch
made
all
contributions
to
the
profit-sharing
plans,
those
contributions
evolved
because
of
the
work
and
labor
of
the
employees,
who
contributed
to
the
profit
of
merrill
lynch,
and
it
is
no
different
than
merrill
lynch
writing
out
a
check
to
mr,
ware
or
any
other
respondent
for
their
weekly
wages
because
profit-sharing
even
as
interpreted
by
federal
court,
results
because
of
a
man's
labor
and
is
not
construed
as
a
gift.
now,
the
concern
of
the
courts
to
avoid
forfeitures
has
manifested
i
think
most
recently
by
the
action
of
the
senate
in
adopting
and
passing
hr4200,
which
is
the
private
pension
plan
will,
and
that
states
no
unequivocal
terms
that
to
qualify
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
a
pension
may
not
contain
a
forfeiture
provision.
it
also
provides
that
an
individual
works
and
is
given
retirement
benefits
can
carry
those
benefits
from
employer
to
employee,
excuse
me
to
employer.
now
this
is
more
or
less
a
parallel
to
profit-sharing,
it
shows
the
great
concern
not
only
in
the
state
courts
but
in
congress
that
may
not
be
deprived
of
his
lawfully
approved
benefits
and
that
he
be
paid
them.
now
i
submit
--
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well,
your
honor
that's
really
kind
of
theoretical
question,
because
if
david
ware
and
the
rest
of
the
respondents
didn't
work
and
contribute
to
merrill
lynch's
profit
they
wouldn't
get
paid
anything.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
that's
correct,
i
would
agree
to
that
your
honor.
i
don't
make
that
distinction
though
between
--
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
that's
correct.
petitioner
concedes
that.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
there
isn't.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
your
honor,
i
believe
that
merrill
lynch
will
make
such
a
claim.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
yes,
if
there
is
a
breach
of
a
fiduciary
duty.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
that's
correct,
as
against
each
individual
employee
or
former
employee.
that
would
be
one
of
the
issues
that
i
believe
the
court
of
appeals
in
california
left
open.
so
obviously
merrill
lynch's
rights
are
not
prejudiced
by
having
trial.
one
trial
i
should
note
your
honor
that
would
include
everyone
in
the
class
and
to
decide
at
one
time
and
for
all
time,
what
the
respective
rights
of
the
parties
are.
now
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
coin,
we
have
merrill
lynch
suggesting
that
it
would
be
more
efficient
and
effective
to
have
90,
100
or
more
separate
arbitration
hearings
to
decide
each
case
individually,
and
as
the
court
knows
there
is
no
principle
such
as
stare
decisis
that
binds
arbitrators;
a
group
of
arbitrators
could
decide
one
case
one
way,
could
decide
the
next
case
the
other
way.
it
is
not
a
necessary
calvary
of
arbitration
under
the
new
york
stock
exchange
plan
that
one
panel
of
arbitrators
would
hear
each
and
every
one
of
those
cases.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
and
the
case
was
presented
frame
versus
merrill
lynch,
the
labor
code,
section
229
argument
was
not
made,
neither
it
was
there
an
explication
of
the
effectiveness
of
rule
347(b)
in
relationship,
for
example,
to
the
new
york
stock
exchange
constitutional,
waived.
in
the
exhibits
for
this
court,
after
oral
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals;
the
issue
of
frame
v.
merrill
lynch
came
up.
thereafter,
the
court
send
a
letter
to
respective
counsel
which
is
exhibit
d
requesting
--
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
no
it's
not
the
appendix
your
honor,
it's
only
exhibits.
it's
exhibit
d
requesting
further
written
argument
regarding
five
separate
points.
one
of
those
points
was
related
to
labor
code
section
229.
the
court
specifically
held
in
ware
versus
merrill
lynch,
that
the
court
didn't
consider
the
application
of
frame
versus
merrill
lynch
of
labor
code
section
229
and
i
think
the
court
should
be
commended
for
having
a
judicial
courage
to
reverse
what
i
considered
an
incorrect
decision
at
the
outset
and
i
should
also
know
that
under
the
class
aspects
of
this
case
that
mr.
frame,
i
believe
would
be
covered.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well
he
didn't
lose
against
merits,
your
honor.
all
it
said
was
that,
there
should
be
arbitration
and
i
believe
--
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
right.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well
i
should
note
that
that
is
the
issue
of
arbitration.
i
should
note
that
there
was
an
extensive
discussion
between
myself
and
mr.
frame's
counsel
regarding
his
position
before
the
argument
on
appeal
and
there
was
an
invitation
at
that
time
extended
to
him
to
join
in
the
class
and
of
course
we
considered
in
great
detail,
what
decision
he
was
going
to
take
in
his
briefs
which
was
different
from
the
position
that
i
took
on
behalf
the
quest
in
my
brief.
i
believe,
your
honor
in
conclusion
that
i
would
like
to
know
that
--
i
just
feel
of
it
inconceivable
what
congress
could
have
meant
that
new
york
law
which
has
no
significant
context
with
california
residents
in
this
case
should
apply
to
the
exclusion
of
law
--
49
other
states
many
of
which
would
have
significant
context
as
far
as
their
own
residents
are
concerned
at
least.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
that's
correct.
pursuant
to
it's
rule
making
authority
granted
under
6(c).
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
thank
the
court
this
time.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it's
important
for
this
case,
perspective
so
that
the
court
can
consider
that
the
narrow
issues
that
are
presented
here.
this
case
is
really
about
100
or
more
former
employees
of
merrill
lynch
who
resided
in
california.
and
who
worked
for
their
employer
with
integrity
and
with
competency.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
in
california,
right.
and
by
reason
of
their
employment
and
by
reason
of
contributing
to
the
success
of
merill
lynch
are
entitled
to
be
paid
to
earn
wages.
now
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
the
profit-sharing
that
we
are
talking
about
is
wages.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
i
believe
petitioner
stipulated
to
the
definition
of
wages
as
authoritatively
construed
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
case
of
wise
v.
southern
pacific.
so
they
are
asking
that
they
be
paid
their
lawfully
approved
wages.
now
this
case
is
not
about
any
individuals
who
have
violated
any
rules
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange,
any
regulations
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
the
determination
of
the
class,
your
honor
was
limited
to
those
individuals
who
by
reason
of
one
fact,
they
went
to
work
with
a
competitor
where
they
opened
a
competing
business
were
denied
their
profit-sharing
rights.
there
is
nothing
in
the
case.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
interpretation
of
business
and
professions
code
section
16,600
forecloses
that
consideration
because
it
states
on
its
very
face
that
any
restraint,
and
there
is
a
different
set
of
laws
your
honor
in
california
that
applied
to
customer
lists
and
confidential
information.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well
your
honor.
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
no,
i
don't
think
that's
the
question
your
honor.
arbitration
is
not
mandated
by
any
rule
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
as
amicus
has
pointed
out
in
this
brief
nor
is
it
required
by
any--
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
securities
and
exchange
commission
has
filed
amicus
brief
in
the
case
and
it's
their
position
that
the
rule
is
not
required
by
any
regulation,
any
legislations
enacted
by
congress
in
the
securities
and
exchange
act
particularly
and
it's
not
required
by
any
rule
or
regulations
promulgated
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well
your
honor,
you
are
asking
about
a
question
about
new
york
law.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well
and
according
to
the
case
that
i
have
cited
to
my
brief.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
it
would
not
have
been
enforced
your
honor,
because
it
concerns
a
matter
of
illegality
which
is
unenforceable
in
the
new
york
courts
pursuant
to
the
decision
of
the
highest
court,
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
why
is
it
new
york
law
because
the
number
one,
your
honor,
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
california
courts
based
on
california
law
by
the
petitioner
and
the
petitioner
asked
for
interpretation
of
the
re
1
form
and
rule
347b.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
(inaudible)
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well,
the
nexus
of
the
compliant
your
honor,
was
about
the
forfeiture
provision
in
a
profit-sharing
plan
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
securities.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
yes,
it
did
your
honor,
as
to
one
little
area.
we
have
got
an
exception.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well
that's
the
specific
question
but
the
general
question.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
yes
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
as
to
wage
dispute.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
that's
correct
your
honor.
as
to
wage
disputes.
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
was
valid
in
new
york.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
that's
correct
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
excuse
me,
your
honor.
there
has
been
no
definition
yet
in
legislative
history
of
the
act
of
what
located
means.
now
i
submit
your
honor,
that
new
york
stock
exchange
is
physically
located
in
new
york.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
alright.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
as
the
matter
would
be
decided
under
new
york
state
law,
new
york
state
law
would
determine
where
the
arbitration
would---
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
i
don't
believe
that
new
york
state
law
is
contrary
in
outcome,
i
believe
it
would
be
the
same
result.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
at
the
conclusion
of
yesterday's
session,
the
court
had
addressed
itself
to
the
6
(c)
argument
concerning
the
application
of
state
law.
in
that
connection,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
in
their
amicus
brief
files
in
the
osmosis
of
the
solicitor
general
considered
that
very
argument
made
by
the
petitioner,
and
stated
on
page
9
of
its
brief
that
there
is
no
basis
for
suggesting
that
rule
347
(b)
was
required
to
implement
the
literal
language
of
the
act
or
any
commission
rule.
it
further
concluded
that
the
application
of
california
law
was
proper
in
this
case
and
urged
affirmance
of
the
california
court
decision.
i
would
like
to
point
out
regarding
section
6
(c)
that
it
specifically
provides
that
any
rule
enacted
by
any
exchange
must
conform
to
the
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
securities
exchange
act
as
well
as
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
and
that
this
court
has
held
in
silver
v.
new
york
stock
exchange
that
the
rule
of
an
exchange
may
be
judicially
invalidated
as
being
beyond
the
great
purposes
of
the
securities
exchange
act.
i
submit
that
rule,
that
28
(c)
and
rule
347
(b)
as
adopted
by
the
new
york
stock
exchange
is
a
stipulation,
that's
in
the
meaning
of
section
78
cca
of
the
act
and
is
void
by
reason
there
of.
moreover,
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
grant
of
judicial
authority
that
congress
gave
the
courts
in
section
27
of
the
act
which
would
be
15
u.s.c.
78aa
and
that
provides
that
the
district
courts
of
the
united
states
shall
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
violations
of
this
chapter
with
the
rules
and
regulations
they
are
under.
in
addition,
rule
347
(b)
is
inconsistent
with
the
provisions
of
the
federal
arbitration
act,
since
admittedly,
it
is
an
agreement
which
concerns
interstate
commerce
and
which
is
a
part
of
the
employment
contract.
as
this
court
noted
in
the
prima
paint
decision,
the
federal
arbitration
act
was
not
meant
to
apply
to
contracts
of
employment
between
parties
of
an
equal
bargaining
strength.
justice
black
in
his
dissenting
opinion
in
that
case
spelled
out
the
legislative
intent
behind
the
federal
arbitration
act,
and
that
was
that
it
was
not
meant
to
apply
to
contracts
of
employment.
now
both
this
court
and
silver
and
the
senate
subcommittee,
the
securities
--
the
subcommittee
on
securities
in
its
extensive
analysis
of
the
functioning
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
concluded
that
judicial
review
was
necessary
regarding
the
self
regulatory
powers
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
i
would
like
to
observe
at
this
point
that
it
is
not
the
new
york
stock
exchange
which
is
a
party
to
this
lawsuit
but
rather
a
private
corporation
that
came
into
existence
by
virtue
of
state
law
and
that
merrill
lynch,
like
being
a
member
of
the0
new
york
stock
exchange
is
also
a
member
of
the
pacific
coast
stock
exchange
which
is
physically
located
in
california.
now
if
congress
meant
physical
location
in
section
6
c,
it
would
lead
to
disunity
in
decision
because
there
are
many
stock
exchanges
located
throughout
the
country
which
are
not
in
new
york
and
that
would
give
a
stock
exchange
moreover,
the
opportunity
to
physically
locate
itself
in
a
state
whose
laws
are
favorable
to
its
policies
and
thereby
effectively
emasculate
the
laws
of
49
other
states.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
yes,
i
submit
that
would
be
correct
under
one
rationale.
i
believe
that
congress
intended,
by
location
to
mean
the
application
of
those
laws
of
a
state
which
have
significant
interest
in
the
case,
such
as
california
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
your
honor,
the
pacific
coast
stock
exchange
does
have
rules
concerning
arbitration
which
are
very
similar
to
article
8,
section
1
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
constitution
which
provides
in
essence
that
a
member,
merrill
lynch
in
this
case
cannot
compel
beyond
member
to
arbitrate.
that
choice
is
given
to
the
non-member,
if
he
willingly
wishes
to
invoke
arbitration
and
the
rationale
behind
that
distinction
is
that
obviously
merrill
lynch
has
voice
in
the
exchange
rules
which
an
employee
does
not
have,
so
they
do
not
have
equal
bargaining
strength.
so
they
give
the
non-number
the
option
to
request
arbitration.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
if
the
employee
demands
it?
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
yes,
i
think
that
if
the
employee
demands
it
that
would
be
an
exception.
the
application
would
be--
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
section
229
of
the
california
labor
code.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
is
your
honor
referring
to
the
arbitration
process?
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well,
your
honor,
it
is
not
my
opinion
that
the
arbitration
clause
of
the
rule
was
made
for
the
benefit
the
employee
but
rather
to
benefit
the
members
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
because
the
employee
would
be
compelled
to
arbitrate
before
what
i
consider
a
less
than
impartial
panel.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
yes,
well,
your
honor.
when
there
is
a
--
i
was
to
say,
a
body
of
decision
that
indicates
that
an
individual
may
not
waive
a
law
inactive
for
his
benefit,
that
represents
public
policy.
i
would
say
that
the
california
courts
would
have
to
consider
in
a
factual
context
whether
or
not
--.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well,
the
employee
could
waive
it,
your
honor,
but
whether
the
california
courts
would
recognize
that
waiver
is
a
different
question.
and
i
should
also
point
out
that
rule
347
(b)
does
conflict.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
in
that
context,
your
honor,
they
would
not,
unless
the
employer
moves
the
court
to
compel
that
the
matter
not
be
arbitrated
but
go
to
court.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
that
is
not
permitted
under
california
law,
your
honor.
it
is
the
--.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
correct
your
honor.
if
the
employees
submitted
to
arbitration,
and
the
employer
rejected
that
request,
the
employer
would
then
be
in
the
position
of
going
to
court
to
avoid
arbitration,
the
issue
that
would
arise
in
that
context,
and
i
guess
it
could
also
rise
in
the
context
where
both
parties
have
submitted
the
arbitration
and
then
after
the
arbitration,
a
word
was
made
the
employee
being
dissatisfied
with
it,
would
petition
the
courts.
but
under
that
circumstance,
your
honor,
the
californian
courts
would
not
consider
that
objection
as
i
understand
existing
california
law.
i
should
also
--.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
that's
correct,
your
honor.
he
is
bound,
by
since
229,
as
the
states
on
this
space
is
not
compulsory.
it
does
not
say
must.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
your
honor,
under
california
law
it
could
be
either
an
independent
action
or
it
could
be
part
of
a
lawsuit.
there
are
situations
arising
under
california
law
where
you
may
go
in
the
court
on
just
a
petition
to
arbitrate.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
that
is
not
what
happened.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well,
your
honor
under
california
law
it
isn't.
it
established
the
law
of
the
cases
for
the
legality
of
the
forfeiture
provision.
that
is
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
there
are
other
issues
that
remain
to
be
decided
by
the
trial
court.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
that's
correct,
your
honor.
however,
in
all
fairness,
i
should
note
that
if
the
court
consider
arbitration
to
be
an
outcome
determinative,
as
was
indicated
in
the
bernhard
decision,
then
that
part
of
the
california
decision
would
be
final.
i
should
also
like
to
know
your
honor
that
if
i
understood
counsel's
opening
argument,
he
indicated
that
the
profit-sharing
plan
by
virtue
of
article
18.1,
which
is
noted
at
page
41
appendix,
specifically
stated
the
profit-sharing
plan
was
not
to
be
construed
as
part
of
the
employment
contract,
and
i
submit
under
that
theory
then
rule
347(b)
would
have
no
application
in
this
case,
because
it
specifically
relates
to
employment
disputes.
and
by
the
functioning
of
article
18.1,
it
would
be
excluded
from
the
application
of
rule
347(b).
now
concerning
counsel's
statement
that
respondents
--
some
have
been
guilty
of
forum
shopping,
i
submit
that
is
not
accurate.
now
each
and
every
respondent
is
a
citizen
or
resident
of
the
state
of
california.
all
they
have
done
is
petitioned
their
own
state
courts
or
decision
regarding
this
dispute.
they
have
not
sought
to
go
outside
their
home
state,
for
example
nevada
or
wyoming
to
forum
shop.
this
is
not
a
case
of
forum
shopping.
now
the
policy
of
california
is
spelled
out
in
several
cases.
california
courts
deemed
in
a
matter
of
important
strong
public
policy
considering
the
right
of
the
wager
into
to
all
lawfully
approved
wages.
in
this
context,
i
would
like
to
note
that
although
technically
merrill
lynch
made
all
contributions
to
the
profit-sharing
plans,
those
contributions
evolved
because
of
the
work
and
labor
of
the
employees,
who
contributed
to
the
profit
of
merrill
lynch,
and
it
is
no
different
than
merrill
lynch
writing
out
a
check
to
mr,
ware
or
any
other
respondent
for
their
weekly
wages
because
profit-sharing
even
as
interpreted
by
federal
court,
results
because
of
a
man's
labor
and
is
not
construed
as
a
gift.
now,
the
concern
of
the
courts
to
avoid
forfeitures
has
manifested
i
think
most
recently
by
the
action
of
the
senate
in
adopting
and
passing
hr4200,
which
is
the
private
pension
plan
will,
and
that
states
no
unequivocal
terms
that
to
qualify
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
a
pension
may
not
contain
a
forfeiture
provision.
it
also
provides
that
an
individual
works
and
is
given
retirement
benefits
can
carry
those
benefits
from
employer
to
employee,
excuse
me
to
employer.
now
this
is
more
or
less
a
parallel
to
profit-sharing,
it
shows
the
great
concern
not
only
in
the
state
courts
but
in
congress
that
may
not
be
deprived
of
his
lawfully
approved
benefits
and
that
he
be
paid
them.
now
i
submit
--
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well,
your
honor
that's
really
kind
of
theoretical
question,
because
if
david
ware
and
the
rest
of
the
respondents
didn't
work
and
contribute
to
merrill
lynch's
profit
they
wouldn't
get
paid
anything.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
that's
correct,
i
would
agree
to
that
your
honor.
i
don't
make
that
distinction
though
between
--
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
that's
correct.
petitioner
concedes
that.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
there
isn't.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
your
honor,
i
believe
that
merrill
lynch
will
make
such
a
claim.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
yes,
if
there
is
a
breach
of
a
fiduciary
duty.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
that's
correct,
as
against
each
individual
employee
or
former
employee.
that
would
be
one
of
the
issues
that
i
believe
the
court
of
appeals
in
california
left
open.
so
obviously
merrill
lynch's
rights
are
not
prejudiced
by
having
trial.
one
trial
i
should
note
your
honor
that
would
include
everyone
in
the
class
and
to
decide
at
one
time
and
for
all
time,
what
the
respective
rights
of
the
parties
are.
now
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
coin,
we
have
merrill
lynch
suggesting
that
it
would
be
more
efficient
and
effective
to
have
90,
100
or
more
separate
arbitration
hearings
to
decide
each
case
individually,
and
as
the
court
knows
there
is
no
principle
such
as
stare
decisis
that
binds
arbitrators;
a
group
of
arbitrators
could
decide
one
case
one
way,
could
decide
the
next
case
the
other
way.
it
is
not
a
necessary
calvary
of
arbitration
under
the
new
york
stock
exchange
plan
that
one
panel
of
arbitrators
would
hear
each
and
every
one
of
those
cases.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
and
the
case
was
presented
frame
versus
merrill
lynch,
the
labor
code,
section
229
argument
was
not
made,
neither
it
was
there
an
explication
of
the
effectiveness
of
rule
347(b)
in
relationship,
for
example,
to
the
new
york
stock
exchange
constitutional,
waived.
in
the
exhibits
for
this
court,
after
oral
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals;
the
issue
of
frame
v.
merrill
lynch
came
up.
thereafter,
the
court
send
a
letter
to
respective
counsel
which
is
exhibit
d
requesting
--
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
no
it's
not
the
appendix
your
honor,
it's
only
exhibits.
it's
exhibit
d
requesting
further
written
argument
regarding
five
separate
points.
one
of
those
points
was
related
to
labor
code
section
229.
the
court
specifically
held
in
ware
versus
merrill
lynch,
that
the
court
didn't
consider
the
application
of
frame
versus
merrill
lynch
of
labor
code
section
229
and
i
think
the
court
should
be
commended
for
having
a
judicial
courage
to
reverse
what
i
considered
an
incorrect
decision
at
the
outset
and
i
should
also
know
that
under
the
class
aspects
of
this
case
that
mr.
frame,
i
believe
would
be
covered.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well
he
didn't
lose
against
merits,
your
honor.
all
it
said
was
that,
there
should
be
arbitration
and
i
believe
--
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
right.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
well
i
should
note
that
that
is
the
issue
of
arbitration.
i
should
note
that
there
was
an
extensive
discussion
between
myself
and
mr.
frame's
counsel
regarding
his
position
before
the
argument
on
appeal
and
there
was
an
invitation
at
that
time
extended
to
him
to
join
in
the
class
and
of
course
we
considered
in
great
detail,
what
decision
he
was
going
to
take
in
his
briefs
which
was
different
from
the
position
that
i
took
on
behalf
the
quest
in
my
brief.
i
believe,
your
honor
in
conclusion
that
i
would
like
to
know
that
--
i
just
feel
of
it
inconceivable
what
congress
could
have
meant
that
new
york
law
which
has
no
significant
context
with
california
residents
in
this
case
should
apply
to
the
exclusion
of
law
--
49
other
states
many
of
which
would
have
significant
context
as
far
as
their
own
residents
are
concerned
at
least.
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
that's
correct.
pursuant
to
it's
rule
making
authority
granted
under
6(c).
mr.
joseph
c.
barton
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
thank
the
court
this
time.
