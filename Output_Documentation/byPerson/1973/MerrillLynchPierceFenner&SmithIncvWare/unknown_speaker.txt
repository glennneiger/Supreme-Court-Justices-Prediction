unknown
speaker
what
if
this
provision
of
the
exchange
rule
was
contrary
to
laws
of
new
york?
let's
assume
that
new
york
had
a
provision
like
california
does
or
about
this
arbitration
and
this
restrictive
agreement.
unknown
speaker
well
then
are
you
saying
that
it's
just
the
agreement
in
the
contract
that
invalidates
the
california
provision,
or
are
you
saying
that
there
is
provision
in
the
federal
law,
which
says
that
the
validity
of
the
exchange
rules
is
to
be
governed
by
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
it
is
located?
if
some
other
state
that
attempts
to
invalidate
what
is
consistent
with
new
york
law,
the
federal
law
prevents.
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
are
arguing
that
if
california,
nevertheless
attempts
to
invalidate
a
stock
exchange
rule
which
is
consistent
with
the
law
of
new
york,
it's
the
federal
law
that
prevents
california
from
doing
so.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
preemption
that
you
called
it,
but
it's
a
conflict
in
preemption?
unknown
speaker
putting
in
an
argument
that
is
the
conflict.
unknown
speaker
putting
it
in
another
way,
mr.
orrick.
if
i
understand
it
correctly.
what
you
are
really
arguing
is
that
by
reason
of
the
federal
statute
section
c,
that
statute
makes
california
law
inapplicable
to
the
determination
of
this
issue.
only
new
york
law
maybe
tested
to
see,
whether
new
york
law,
or
whether
these
regulations
went
consistent
with
new
york
law.
unknown
speaker
well
if
you
are
right
about
that,
what's
left
to
the
case?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
but
then
you
won
your
case
on
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
that's
the
only
issue,
thing
that's
here.
the
only
issue
that's
here
is
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
well
actually
i
suppose,
the
issue
is
whether
this
california
statute
was
properly
applied
to
deny
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
whatever
they
may
be
if
you
are
right
and
your
interpretation
of
section
c
of
the
federal
statute
and
of
the
supremacy
of
the
federal
statute,
as
applied
here,
we
don't
have
to
get
into
any
california
statute.
unknown
speaker
stock
exchange
commission.
unknown
speaker
this
argument
arose
in
new
york,
i
suppose
the
other
things
with
the
clause
would
have
been
enforced
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
am.
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
will
ask
it
in
another
way
then.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
will
ask
you
in
another
way.
your
position
in
the
case
is
that
california
law
governs
this
case
as
to
the
enforceability
of
the
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
new
york
law
applicable?
unknown
speaker
who
brought
the
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
and
you
based
it
on
new
york,
on
california
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
case
was
decided
by
the
court
on
the
basis
of
california
law.
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
below
applied
california
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
area
is
whether
or
not
the
arbitration
clauses
to
be
enforced
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
just.
i
don't
want
to
go
any
farther
than
that.
unknown
speaker
i
am
talking
about
the
arbitration
provision.
unknown
speaker
the
california
law
governed
this,
it
was
helping
to
govern
this
case.
unknown
speaker
now
let's
assume
that
the
arbitration
clause
was
quite
valid
in
new
york.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
that
it
was.
now
6c
says
that
the
stock
exchange
rule,
stock
exchange
may
make
rule,
consistent
with
the
law
of
state
which
they
are
incorporated
in.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
that
we
decided
here
or
some
court
decided
that
located
means
for
the
new
york
stock
exchange,
it
means
new
york.
let's
assume
that.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
it
for
purposes
of
section
6c,
the
stock
exchange
is
located
in
new
york
then
what?
unknown
speaker
contrary
to
what
was
the
law
that
was
applied
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
the
pacific
stock
exchange
had
any
rules
touching
this
area
of
relationship
between
a
termination
of
employment
of
a
registered
customers
plan
or
employer?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
federal
court
should
order
arbitration
in
a
case
like
is
now
before
us
if
the
employee
demands
it?
unknown
speaker
under
california
law?
unknown
speaker
under
california
law?
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
a
waiver,
i
suppose,
of
the
california
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
follow
that.
if
i
understand,
if
i
read
section
29
correctly,
what
it
says
is
that
the
individual
may
maintain
an
action
without
regard
to
the
existence
of
any
file
being
arbitrated.
however,
the
employee
didn't
bother
bringing
an
action,
but
rather
submitted
the
arbitration
with
probably
the
california
courts
have
ever
get
to?
unknown
speaker
once,
once
he
voluntarily
goes
to
arbitrations,
he
can't
take
advantage
of
229
rather?
unknown
speaker
it
may
be
maintained.
unknown
speaker
without
regard
to
current
requirement.
unknown
speaker
you
still
would
have
a
stronger
case,
if
it
were
a
contributory
plan,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
merrill
lynch
probably
views,
this
is
a
gratuity
on
their
part,
it's
something
that
deals
with
loyalty
or
two
sides
to
the
issues.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
any
event,
that
really
goes
to
the
merits
of
what
would
be
tried
in
a
court.
if
you
are
correct
or
tried
by
an
arbitrator,
if
your
brother
on
the
other
side
is
correct.
there
is
no
question,
but
isn't
it
conceded
that
these
are
wages
and
that's
what
the
statute
says
--
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
there
was
any
question.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
indication
of
why
your
state
court
of
appeals
finished
its
course
by
183
--
unknown
speaker
is
it
the
appendix?
unknown
speaker
even
though
he
lost?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
on
the
merits
of
the
issue,
it's
not
before
us.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
issue
as.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
not
correct.
it
is
merely
the
issue,
is
it.
it
isn't
the
real
issue
whether
this
rule
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
declined
which
incorporates
or
refers
to
new
york
law,
but
it's
a
rule
of
the
new
york
stock--
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
orrick,
at
some
point
would
you
mind
dealing
with
the
government's
argument
in
6
©
--
the
language
of
6
(c)
is
very
broad,
any
rule
it
says,
any
rule
but
i
read
the
brief
amicus
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
is
saying
no,
any
rule
should
be
limited
to
rules
related
to
investor
protection,
fair
dealing
or
fair
exchange
administration.
i
gather
based
on,
what
they
give
us
in
the
way
of
legislative
history
of
6
(c)
and
of
the
general
purposes
of
the
act
and
as
i
read
their
conclusion,
it
is
that
any
rule
does
not
embrace
347
(b).
unknown
speaker
but
am
i
right
mr.
orrick
that
your
whole
case
depends
on
6
(c),
the
language
of
6
©,
rules
and
regulation
including
347
(b),
doesn't
it.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
not
a
federal
question,
that's
not
our
problem.
so
far
as
your
case
in
this
court
turns
on
your
persuading
us,
does
it
not
that
6
(c)
covers
347
(b)?
unknown
speaker
a
rule
and
regulation
within
6
©.
unknown
speaker
where
is
that,
what's
article
6,
section
3?
where
is
that?
unknown
speaker
listening
to
part
of
your
argument,
it
is
certainly
related
to
6
(c)
argument,
the
california
rule
sets
it
not
an
important
objective
of
the
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
and
wholly
aside
from
6
(c)
you
would
argue
that?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
need
to
argue
that
expect
in
connection
with
6,
if
you
have
read
about
it,
6
(c)
automatically
picks
it--
unknown
speaker
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
the
securities
industry
has
a
federally
mandated,
self-regulation
in
order
to
accomplish
this
self-regulation
as
judge
medina
has
indicated
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
necessary
element
of
it
is
to
be
able
to
enforce
arbitration
and
if
you
are
unable
to
enforce
the
arbitration,
which
is
guarded
with
respect
to
a
rule
governing
the
conduct
of
employees
in
one
state
or
you
can
do
it
in
another
state,
i
think
that
defies
the
very
purpose
of
this
federally
mandated
self-regulation.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
mr.
orrick,
if
new
york
had
a
229
then
section
--
section
c
would
rule
out
the
arbitration
provision
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
because
the
only
rules
that
the
exchange
may
adopt
are
rules
and
regulations
not
inconsistent
with
the
applicable
laws
of
the
state
which
is
located.
so,
if
new
york
had
a
229
that
would
nullify,
would
it
not,
the
arbitration
provisions
of
347
(b)?
unknown
speaker
unless,
the
commission
is
self
required
by
regulation?
unknown
speaker
what
if
this
provision
of
the
exchange
rule
was
contrary
to
laws
of
new
york?
let's
assume
that
new
york
had
a
provision
like
california
does
or
about
this
arbitration
and
this
restrictive
agreement.
unknown
speaker
well
then
are
you
saying
that
it's
just
the
agreement
in
the
contract
that
invalidates
the
california
provision,
or
are
you
saying
that
there
is
provision
in
the
federal
law,
which
says
that
the
validity
of
the
exchange
rules
is
to
be
governed
by
the
law
of
the
state
in
which
it
is
located?
if
some
other
state
that
attempts
to
invalidate
what
is
consistent
with
new
york
law,
the
federal
law
prevents.
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
are
arguing
that
if
california,
nevertheless
attempts
to
invalidate
a
stock
exchange
rule
which
is
consistent
with
the
law
of
new
york,
it's
the
federal
law
that
prevents
california
from
doing
so.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
preemption
that
you
called
it,
but
it's
a
conflict
in
preemption?
unknown
speaker
putting
in
an
argument
that
is
the
conflict.
unknown
speaker
putting
it
in
another
way,
mr.
orrick.
if
i
understand
it
correctly.
what
you
are
really
arguing
is
that
by
reason
of
the
federal
statute
section
c,
that
statute
makes
california
law
inapplicable
to
the
determination
of
this

only

law
maybe
tested
to

whether
new

or
whether
these

went
consistent

unknown
speaker
well
if
you
are
right
about
that,
what's
left
to
the
case?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
but
then
you
won
your
case
on
arbitration.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
that's
the
only
issue,
thing
that's
here.
the

this

arose

i
will

well,
the

was
decided
by
the

on
the
basis
of
california
law.
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
below
applied
california
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
area
is
whether
or
not
the
arbitration
clauses
to
be
enforced
in
this
case?
unknown

no,
i
just.
i
don't
want
to
go
any
farther
than
that.
unknown

i
am
talking
about
the
arbitration

the

let's

was

let's

that
it
was.
now
6c
says
that
the

may
make
rule,
consistent
with
the
law
of
state
which
they
are
incorporated
in.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
that
we
decided
here
or
some
court
decided
that
located
means
for
the
new

stock
exchange,
it
means
new
york.
let's
assume
that.
unknown

let's
assume
it
for

the

is

in

then
what?

doesn't
it.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
not
a
federal
question,
that's
not
our
problem.
so
far
as
your
case
in
this
court
turns
on
your
persuading
us,
does
it
not
that
6
(c)
covers
347
(b)?
unknown
speaker
a
rule
and
regulation
within
6
©.
unknown
speaker
where
is
that,
what's
article
6,
section
3?
where
is
that?
unknown
speaker
listening
to
part
of
your
argument,
it
is
certainly
related
to
6
(c)
argument,
the
california
rule
sets
it
not
an
important
objective
of
the
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
and
wholly
aside
from
6
(c)
you
would
argue
that?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
need
to
argue
that
expect
in
connection
with
6,
if
you
have
read
about
it,
6
(c)
automatically
picks
it--
unknown
speaker
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
the
securities
industry
has
a
federally
mandated,
self-regulation
in
order
to
accomplish
this
self-regulation
as
judge
medina
has
indicated
in
the
(inaudible)
case.
necessary
element
of
it
is
to
be
able
to
enforce
arbitration
and
if
you
are
unable
to
enforce
the
arbitration,
which
is
guarded
with
respect
to
a
rule
governing
the
conduct
of
employees
in
one
state
or
you
can
do
it
in
another
state,
i
think
that
defies
the
very
purpose
of
this
federally
mandated
self-regulation.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
mr.
orrick,
if
new
york
had
a
229
then
section
--
section
c
would
rule
out
the
arbitration
provision
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
because
the
only
rules
that
the
exchange
may
adopt
are
rules
and
regulations
not
inconsistent
with
the
applicable
laws
of
the
state
which
is
located.
so,
if
new
york
had
a
229
that
would
nullify,
would
it
not,
the
arbitration
provisions
of
347
(b)?
unknown
speaker
unless,
the
commission
is
self
required
by
regulation?
