mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
save
my
last
10
minutes
for
rebuttal.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
first
appellate
district
of
the
court
of
appeal
of
california
which
is
our
intermediate
appellate
court.
it
is
an
action
for
declaratory
relief
and
damages
which
was
brought
in
the
california
superior
court
by
mr.
ware
on
behalf
of
himself
and
others
alleging
that
a
forfeiture
provision
in
a
profit
sharing
plan
violated
by
california
law
and
is
unenforcible.
merrill
lynch
answered
and
petitioned
for
arbitration
and
it
did
so
because
it
had
agreed
with
merrill
lynch,
with
ware,
that
any
and
all
disputes
arising
out
of
his
employment
would
be
arbitrated
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
new
york
stock
exchange.
the
judge
in
the
superior
court
denied
the
petition
without
findings
and
he
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeal.
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
four
months
prior,
the
very
same
court
had
held
under
identical
facts
that
merrill
lynch
had
the
right
to
arbitrate.
now
that
case
is
the
ware
case
which
we
have
included
in
our
appendix
and
to
which
i
shall
make
further
reference.
merrill
lynch
then
petitioned
the
supreme
court
of
california
to
review
these
two
conflicting
decisions.
the
supreme
court
denied
it
and
we
came
here
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
there
isn't
a
federal
interest
in
maintaining
the
uniform
application
of
these
new
york
stock
exchange
rules.
now
the
pertinent
facts
are
few
and
they
can
be
stated
simply.
ware
was
employed
as
an
account
executive
at
merrill
lynch
in
july
1958.
merrill
lynch
is
a
member
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
as
such
it
is
required
to
abide
by
its
rules
which
include
the
fact
that
all
account
executives
must
be
registered
representatives
of
the
stock
exchange.
now,
to
become
a
registered
representative
of
the
stock
exchange,
it
is
necessary
for
the
applicant
to
undergo
a
rigorous
26
week
training
course
to
pass
an
examination
with
respect
to
both
his
competence
and
his
integrity
and
then
he
must
agree
to
abide
by
the
rules
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
the
rules
requiring
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
rule
345
and
the
rules
governing
arbitration,
rule
347
is
on
page
9
of
the
appendix.
mr.
ware
did
exactly
this.
he
took
the
course,
he
passed
and
he
signed
an
agreement
to
abide
by
the
rules
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes
sir?
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
frame
excuse
me
yes.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
no
sir.
they
were
both
the
same
division.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
the
first
appellate
district.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that's
correct.
judge
(inaudible),
yes
sir;
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
four
months
apart.
yes
sir.
the
frame
then
went
to
work
as
a
registered
representative
in
san
fransisco
office
of
merrill
lynch.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
i
spoke
myself.
thank
you
mr.
justice.
this
is
ware
case.
he
then
went
to
work
for
merrill
lynch
and
he
became
eligible
in
january,
to
become
a
participant
in
the
merrill
lynch
profit-sharing
plan.
now
the
merrill
lynch
profit-sharing
plan
is
a
plan
which
merrill
lynch
is
a
sole
contributor.
and
the
purpose
of
the
plan
is
to
provide
an
incentive
for
the
employee
to
stay
with
merrill
lynch
and
to
provide
him
a
future
and
additional
source
of
income.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
plan
specifically
provides
an
article
18,
that
it
is
not
be
considered
part
of
the
contract.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
the
arbitration
clause
is.
the
plan
has
several
other
very
important
provisions.
in
section
22.1,
it
provides
that
it
shall
be
interpreted
under
the
laws
of
new
york
and
in
article
11.1
which
brings
about
the
instant
lawsuit.
it
provides
that
an
employee
voluntarily
terminates
his
employment
with
merrill
lynch
and
goes
to
work
for
a
competitor
that
his
rights
and
benefits
under
the
plan,
maybe
declared
forfeit.
now
to
join
the
plan
mr.
ware
had
to
agree
that
the
conditions
of
the
plan
and
this
he
did,
his
second
agreement.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
because
what
appeared
to
be
the
gravamen
of
mr.
ware's
action,
namely,
that
the
business
and
professions
code
section
16,600,
made
this
forfeiture
clause
invalid,
and
therefore
the
choice
of
law
--
therefore
that
created
a
strong
public
policy
in
california
which
would
outlaw
the
choice
of
law
provision,
i
don't
know
if
i
make
myself.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
well,
i
haven't
said
that,
your
honor,
except
that
i
want
to
make
this
point,
the
california
statute
which
is
business
and
professions
code
16,600,
provides
every
contract
by
which
anyone
is
restrained
from
engaging
in
a
lawful
profession
trade
or
business
of
any
kind,
is
to
that
extent
void.
that's
what
the
statute
says.
now
the
supreme
court
in
this
muggill
v.
reuben
h.
donnelley,
held
that
the
application
of
that
statute
to
a
provision
in
a
plan
that
was
similar
to
this,
would
render
this
forfeiture
clause,
unenforceable
in
california.
however,
that
statute
doesn't
mean
what
it
says,
because
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
another
case,
gordan
against
wandell
has
said
that
statute
will
not
apply
in
a
situation
where
there
are
trade
secrets
or
customers
lists
or
things
of
that
nature
involve.
that
is,
what
we
can
fairly
--
we
think
show
here,
if
we
get
to
arbitration,
what
we
are
asking
here
is
our
right
to
arbitrate.
we
have
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
with
mr.
ware
which
is
under
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
under
the
state
arbitrate
act,
a
valid,
irrevocable
and
enforceable.
in
addition
to
that
we
have
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
sir.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yeah,
that's
why
we
are
here.
we
think
it's
clearly
enforceable
under
the
state
arbitration
act
as
it
is
under
the
federal
act.
and
we
think
that
otherwise,
it
would
be
a
forum
shopping
as
the
chief
judge
foll
dealt
with
the
(inaudible)
deberry
case.
but
we
are
entitled
to
it
under
that,
in
addition
mr.
justice
we
are
entitled
to
it
under
the
new
york
stock
exchange
rules
particularly
347b.
now
these
rules
were
promulgated
pursuant
to
section
6c
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934
and
they
are
in
this
industry,
the
only
industry
of
its
kind
where
this
court
has
referred
to
it
as
federally
mandated
self-regulation.
arbitration
is
a
very
important
part
of
that
self-regulation
and
we
have
here
a
situation
involving
inter-state
commerce
and
we
have
here
a
situation
involving
the
question
whether
these
rules,
the
new
york
stock
exchange
will
be
uniformly
applied,
if
we
are
in
new
york,
for
example,
there's
perfectly
clear
that
there
would
be
arbitration
under
the
rules.
so
we
think
that
we
are
entitled
to
arbitrate
and
entitled
both
under
the
federal
statute
and
under
the
rules
of
the
stock
exchange.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
well
the
plan
is
to
be
interpreted
under
the
laws
of
new
york.
now,
if
new
york
had
ruled
it
invalid,
clearly
the
provision
couldn't
be
interpreted
in
favor
of
merrill
lynch.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
well,
the
federal
law
says
in
section
6c
that
the
stock.exchange
shall
adopt
rules
consistent
with
the
rules
of
the
state
in
which
it
is
located
and
the
new
york
stock
exchange
is
located
in
new
york
and
those
rules
are
consonant
with
the
laws
of
new
york.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that
why
i
think
think
the
doctrine
of
preemption,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that's
quite
exactly
so,
now
i
have
an
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes
let
me.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
correct
mr.
justice
and
that
now
brings
me
to
a
discussion
of
the
california
statute,
labor
code
section
224.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yeah
arbitration.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yeah.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that's
right.
and
then
we
go
back
to
arbitrate.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that's
correct
and
there
are
mr.
justice,
there
are
in
effect
two
california
statute
here
in
question.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that's
correct.
may
i
reserved
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes
sir
and
with
that
i
take
exception,
the
legislative
history
or
the
act
is
replete
with
discussions
of
the
deficiencies
in
employees
of
the
securities
industry
both
as
to
their
competence
and
to
their
integrity.
so
even
the
1964
special
study
mandated
by
congress,
i
had
similar
references
to
these
deficiencies
and
indeed
if
the
court
would
look
at
the
agreements
made
by
mr.
ware
and
his
colleagues
and
i
call
attention
to
them,
one
at
question
here
which
is
on
page
8
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
it's
the
sub-section
j,
rule
345
and
it
reads
english
is
as
plain
as
it
can
be
written,
i
agree
that
any
controversy
between
me
and
any
member
or
member
organization
or
affiliate
or
subsidy
there,
arising
out
of
my
employment
or
the
termination
of
my
employment
shall
be
settled
by
arbitration
at
the
instance
of
any
such
party
in
accordance
with
the
arbitration
procedure
prescribed
in
the
constitution
and
rule
then
obtained
at
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
then
if
you
read
mr.
ware's
affidavit
which
appears
in
volume
1
of
the
record
at
page
171
and
he
says,
as
far
as
i
knew,
this
was
nothing
more
than
an
application
for
registration
at
no
time
with
provisions
contained
in
that
form
discussed
with
me
or
explained
to
me,
nor
was
i
ever
provided
with
any
sort
of
study
guide,
referencing
the
provisions
before
i
signed
it.
i
didn't
understand
it
to
be
a
contract
or
agreement
of
any
type.
i
suggest
that
this
record
itself
is
reason
enough
for
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
employees.
here
are
these
employees
who
are
dealing
with
--
giving
financial
advice
to
widows
and
orphans
who
will
say
under
oath
if
they
don't
understand
what
they
read
and
back
out
on
their
agreements.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
i
don't
recall
if
there
is
anything
in
record
on
that.
now,
the
position
of
merill
lynch
is
first,
we
have
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
under
a
rule
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
which
is
valid
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
under
6
(c)
that
rule
should
be
adhered
to,
whatever
veneer,
the
sec
can
put
on
the
rule
by
saying
that
this
is
within
our
oversight,
the
purview
of
our
oversight
simply
enforces
the
status
of
this
rule
which
we
claim
here
has
the--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
now
the
whole
case
is
–
yesterday,
i
said
first,
we
have
a
right
to
arbitration
under
the
california
arbitration
act
which
is
the
same
as
the
federal
arbitration
act.
we
have
a
right
to
arbitration
under
these--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
well
the
347
(b)
was
enacted
pursuant
to--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
well
i
think
it's
also
a
rule
and
regulation
enacted
pursuant
to
article
3,
section
6
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
it
is
an
equally
valid
binding
agreement.
what
we
have
here
is
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
article
3,
section
6,
i
don't
believe
that
we
have
it
printed.
it's
in
the
constitution
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
which
authorizes
the
directors
to
make
such
rules
and
regulations
as
are
necessary.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
exactly
sir.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that's
right.
an
important
federal
policy.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that's
what
i
am
trying
to
say,
the
rules
such
as--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
i
think
to
be
fair
with
the
board
i
think
if
new
york
had
a
rule
229,
we
would
have
a
different
case.
that
is
not
our
case
here,
however.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
i
would
think
that
is
so,
yes.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
one
other
point
i
want
to
make
justice
rehnquist,
ask
mr.
barton
as
to
whether
or
not
that
california
court
order
is
final,
it
is
indeed
final
as
to
merrill
lynch
where
the
petition
to
arbitrate
is
denied.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
we
filed
in
effect
that
what
we
did,
we
filed
an
answer
and
we
filed
a
petition
to
arbitrate
and
the
court
denied
the
petition
to
arbitrate
and
that's
what
was
on
appeal.
with
respect
to
the
question
that
justice
stewart
asked,
mr.
barton
asked
whether
or
not
section
229
was
part
of
the
frame
case,
he
asked
if
there
is
any
explanation
for
these
two
diametrically
opposite
opinions.
mr.
barton
correctly
said
that
it
wasn't
discussed
in
the
frame
case
but
it
was
briefed
in
the
frame
case.
it
didn't
take
part
in
the
opinion.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
with
the
permission
of
the
court,
i
would
like
to
save
my
last
10
minutes
for
rebuttal.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
first
appellate
district
of
the
court
of
appeal
of
california
which
is
our
intermediate
appellate
court.
it
is
an
action
for
declaratory
relief
and
damages
which
was
brought
in
the
california
superior
court
by
mr.
ware
on
behalf
of
himself
and
others
alleging
that
a
forfeiture
provision
in
a
profit
sharing
plan
violated
by
california
law
and
is
unenforcible.
merrill
lynch
answered
and
petitioned
for
arbitration
and
it
did
so
because
it
had
agreed
with
merrill
lynch,
with
ware,
that
any
and
all
disputes
arising
out
of
his
employment
would
be
arbitrated
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
new
york
stock
exchange.
the
judge
in
the
superior
court
denied
the
petition
without
findings
and
he
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeal.
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
four
months
prior,
the
very
same
court
had
held
under
identical
facts
that
merrill
lynch
had
the
right
to
arbitrate.
now
that
case
is
the
ware
case
which
we
have
included
in
our
appendix
and
to
which
i
shall
make
further
reference.
merrill
lynch
then
petitioned
the
supreme
court
of
california
to
review
these
two
conflicting
decisions.
the
supreme
court
denied
it
and
we
came
here
to
ascertain
whether
or
not
there
isn't
a
federal
interest
in
maintaining
the
uniform
application
of
these
new
york
stock
exchange
rules.
now
the
pertinent
facts
are
few
and
they
can
be
stated
simply.
ware
was
employed
as
an
account
executive
at
merrill
lynch
in
july
1958.
merrill
lynch
is
a
member
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
as
such
it
is
required
to
abide
by
its
rules
which
include
the
fact
that
all
account
executives
must
be
registered
representatives
of
the
stock
exchange.
now,
to
become
a
registered
representative
of
the
stock
exchange,
it
is
necessary
for
the
applicant
to
undergo
a
rigorous
26
week
training
course
to
pass
an
examination
with
respect
to
both
his
competence
and
his
integrity
and
then
he
must
agree
to
abide
by
the
rules
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
the
rules
requiring
are
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
rule
345
and
the
rules
governing
arbitration,
rule
347
is
on
page
9
of
the
appendix.
mr.
ware
did
exactly
this.
he
took
the
course,
he
passed
and
he
signed
an
agreement
to
abide
by
the
rules
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes
sir?
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
frame
excuse
me
yes.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
no
sir.
they
were
both
the
same
division.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
the
first
appellate
district.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that's
correct.
judge
(inaudible),
yes
sir;
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
four
months
apart.
yes
sir.
the
frame
then
went
to
work
as
a
registered
representative
in
san
fransisco
office
of
merrill
lynch.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
i
spoke
myself.
thank
you
mr.
justice.
this
is
ware
case.
he
then
went
to
work
for
merrill
lynch
and
he
became
eligible
in
january,
to
become
a
participant
in
the
merrill
lynch
profit-sharing
plan.
now
the
merrill
lynch
profit-sharing
plan
is
a
plan
which
merrill
lynch
is
a
sole
contributor.
and
the
purpose
of
the
plan
is
to
provide
an
incentive
for
the
employee
to
stay
with
merrill
lynch
and
to
provide
him
a
future
and
additional
source
of
income.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
plan
specifically
provides
an
article
18,
that
it
is
not
be
considered
part
of
the
contract.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
the
arbitration
clause
is.
the
plan
has
several
other
very
important
provisions.
in
section
22.1,
it
provides
that
it
shall
be
interpreted
under
the
laws
of
new
york
and
in
article
11.1
which
brings
about
the
instant
lawsuit.
it
provides
that
an
employee
voluntarily
terminates
his
employment
with
merrill
lynch
and
goes
to
work
for
a
competitor
that
his
rights
and
benefits
under
the
plan,
maybe
declared
forfeit.
now
to
join
the
plan
mr.
ware
had
to
agree
that
the
conditions
of
the
plan
and
this
he
did,
his
second
agreement.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
because
what
appeared
to
be
the
gravamen
of
mr.
ware's
action,
namely,
that
the
business
and
professions
code
section
16,600,
made
this
forfeiture
clause
invalid,
and
therefore
the
choice
of
law
--
therefore
that
created
a
strong
public
policy
in
california
which
would
outlaw
the
choice
of
law
provision,
i
don't
know
if
i
make
myself.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
well,
i
haven't
said
that,
your
honor,
except
that
i
want
to
make
this
point,
the
california
statute
which
is
business
and
professions
code
16,600,
provides
every
contract
by
which
anyone
is
restrained
from
engaging
in
a
lawful
profession
trade
or
business
of
any
kind,
is
to
that
extent
void.
that's
what
the
statute
says.
now
the
supreme
court
in
this
muggill
v.
reuben
h.
donnelley,
held
that
the
application
of
that
statute
to
a
provision
in
a
plan
that
was
similar
to
this,
would
render
this
forfeiture
clause,
unenforceable
in
california.
however,
that
statute
doesn't
mean
what
it
says,
because
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
another
case,
gordan
against
wandell
has
said
that
statute
will
not
apply
in
a
situation
where
there
are
trade
secrets
or
customers
lists
or
things
of
that
nature
involve.
that
is,
what
we
can
fairly
--
we
think
show
here,
if
we
get
to
arbitration,
what
we
are
asking
here
is
our
right
to
arbitrate.
we
have
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
with
mr.
ware
which
is
under
the
federal
arbitration
act
and
under
the
state
arbitrate
act,
a
valid,
irrevocable
and
enforceable.
in
addition
to
that
we
have
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
sir.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yeah,
that's
why
we
are
here.
we
think
it's
clearly
enforceable
under
the
state
arbitration
act
as
it
is
under
the
federal
act.
and
we
think
that
otherwise,
it
would
be
a
forum
shopping
as
the
chief
judge
foll
dealt
with
the
(inaudible)
deberry
case.
but
we
are
entitled
to
it
under
that,
in
addition
mr.
justice
we
are
entitled
to
it
under
the
new
york
stock
exchange
rules
particularly
347b.
now
these
rules
were
promulgated
pursuant
to
section
6c
of
the
securities
and
exchange
act
of
1934
and
they
are
in
this
industry,
the
only
industry
of
its
kind
where
this
court
has
referred
to
it
as
federally
mandated
self-regulation.
arbitration
is
a
very
important
part
of
that
self-regulation
and
we
have
here
a
situation
involving
inter-state
commerce
and
we
have
here
a
situation
involving
the
question
whether
these
rules,
the
new
york
stock
exchange
will
be
uniformly
applied,
if
we
are
in
new
york,
for
example,
there's
perfectly
clear
that
there
would
be
arbitration
under
the
rules.
so
we
think
that
we
are
entitled
to
arbitrate
and
entitled
both
under
the
federal
statute
and
under
the
rules
of
the
stock
exchange.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
well
the
plan
is
to
be
interpreted
under
the
laws
of
new
york.
now,
if
new
york
had
ruled
it
invalid,
clearly
the
provision
couldn't
be
interpreted
in
favor
of
merrill
lynch.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
well,
the
federal
law
says
in
section
6c
that
the
stock.exchange
shall
adopt
rules
consistent
with
the
rules
of
the
state
in
which
it
is
located
and
the
new
york
stock
exchange
is
located
in
new
york
and
those
rules
are
consonant
with
the
laws
of
new
york.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that
why
i
think
think
the
doctrine
of
preemption,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that's
quite
exactly
so,
now
i
have
an
--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes
let
me.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
correct
mr.
justice
and
that
now
brings
me
to
a
discussion
of
the
california
statute,
labor
code
section
224.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yeah
arbitration.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yeah.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that's
right.
and
then
we
go
back
to
arbitrate.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that's
correct
and
there
are
mr.
justice,
there
are
in
effect
two
california
statute
here
in
question.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that's
correct.
may
i
reserved
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
yes
sir
and
with
that
i
take
exception,
the
legislative
history
or
the
act
is
replete
with
discussions
of
the
deficiencies
in
employees
of
the
securities
industry
both
as
to
their
competence
and
to
their
integrity.
so
even
the
1964
special
study
mandated
by
congress,
i
had
similar
references
to
these
deficiencies
and
indeed
if
the
court
would
look
at
the
agreements
made
by
mr.
ware
and
his
colleagues
and
i
call
attention
to
them,
one
at
question
here
which
is
on
page
8
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
it's
the
sub-section
j,
rule
345
and
it
reads
english
is
as
plain
as
it
can
be
written,
i
agree
that
any
controversy
between
me
and
any
member
or
member
organization
or
affiliate
or
subsidy
there,
arising
out
of
my
employment
or
the
termination
of
my
employment
shall
be
settled
by
arbitration
at
the
instance
of
any
such
party
in
accordance
with
the
arbitration
procedure
prescribed
in
the
constitution
and
rule
then
obtained
at
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
then
if
you
read
mr.
ware's
affidavit
which
appears
in
volume
1
of
the
record
at
page
171
and
he
says,
as
far
as
i
knew,
this
was
nothing
more
than
an
application
for
registration
at
no
time
with
provisions
contained
in
that
form
discussed
with
me
or
explained
to
me,
nor
was
i
ever
provided
with
any
sort
of
study
guide,
referencing
the
provisions
before
i
signed
it.
i
didn't
understand
it
to
be
a
contract
or
agreement
of
any
type.
i
suggest
that
this
record
itself
is
reason
enough
for
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
employees.
here
are
these
employees
who
are
dealing
with
--
giving
financial
advice
to
widows
and
orphans
who
will
say
under
oath
if
they
don't
understand
what
they
read
and
back
out
on
their
agreements.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
i
don't
recall
if
there
is
anything
in
record
on
that.
now,
the
position
of
merill
lynch
is
first,
we
have
an
agreement
to
arbitrate
under
a
rule
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
which
is
valid
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
under
6
(c)
that
rule
should
be
adhered
to,
whatever
veneer,
the
sec
can
put
on
the
rule
by
saying
that
this
is
within
our
oversight,
the
purview
of
our
oversight
simply
enforces
the
status
of
this
rule
which
we
claim
here
has
the--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
now
the
whole
case
is
–
yesterday,
i
said
first,
we
have
a
right
to
arbitration
under
the
california
arbitration
act
which
is
the
same
as
the
federal
arbitration
act.
we
have
a
right
to
arbitration
under
these--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
well
the
347
(b)
was
enacted
pursuant
to--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
well
i
think
it's
also
a
rule
and
regulation
enacted
pursuant
to
article
3,
section
6
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
it
is
an
equally
valid
binding
agreement.
what
we
have
here
is
an
agreement
to
arbitrate.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
article
3,
section
6,
i
don't
believe
that
we
have
it
printed.
it's
in
the
constitution
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
which
authorizes
the
directors
to
make
such
rules
and
regulations
as
are
necessary.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
exactly
sir.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that's
right.
an
important
federal
policy.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that's
what
i
am
trying
to
say,
the
rules
such
as--
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
i
think
to
be
fair
with
the
board
i
think
if
new
york
had
a
rule
229,
we
would
have
a
different
case.
that
is
not
our
case
here,
however.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
i
would
think
that
is
so,
yes.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
one
other
point
i
want
to
make
justice
rehnquist,
ask
mr.
barton
as
to
whether
or
not
that
california
court
order
is
final,
it
is
indeed
final
as
to
merrill
lynch
where
the
petition
to
arbitrate
is
denied.
mr.
william
h.
orrick,
jr.
we
filed
in
effect
that
what
we
did,
we
filed
an
answer
and
we
filed
a
petition
to
arbitrate
and
the
court
denied
the
petition
to
arbitrate
and
that's
what
was
on
appeal.
with
respect
to
the
question
that
justice
stewart
asked,
mr.
barton
asked
whether
or
not
section
229
was
part
of
the
frame
case,
he
asked
if
there
is
any
explanation
for
these
two
diametrically
opposite
opinions.
mr.
barton
correctly
said
that
it
wasn't
discussed
in
the
frame
case
but
it
was
briefed
in
the
frame
case.
it
didn't
take
part
in
the
opinion.
