justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
wasn’t
that
affirmed
by
the
virginia
supreme
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
what
conceivably
are
your
grounds
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
here
from
that
affirmance?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
to
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
point
in
turn?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
levy,
i
think
there’s
a
suggestion
somewhere
in
the
briefs
perhaps
that
if
you
prevail
here,
employers
might
be
less
willing
to
commence
payments
and
to
reach
settlements
at
the
end
of
the
disability
period.
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
are
we
talking
about
as
a
practical
matter?
how
much
delay
is
there
between
the
date
of
suspension
and
in
the
virginia
system,
the
actual
post
termination
hearing?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
do
i
gather
from
the
last
remark
that
if
this
case
is
reversed,
that
virginia
will
have
to
revise
its
systems
substantially?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
just
wondered
if
you’re
going
to
have
entirely
a
new
world
in
which
to
live?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
do
you
have
a
virginia
decided
case
that
says
that?
