and
that
meanwhile
payments
continue?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

until?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
if
adverse
to
the

at

stage?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
any
more
usual
or
common
ground
of
discontinuance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now
on
cases
like
that,
what
kind
of
hearing
would
you
think
is
required?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
who
do
you
think
should
be
the
decider?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
there
is
no
problem
in
that
respect?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
commission
i
gather
the
post
termination
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
you
agree
provides
due
process?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
was
before
the
virginia
supreme
court
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
appeal
from
its
determination
adverse
to
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
burney.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
will
you
say
again
why
it
is
that
these
cases
disappear
in
the
course
of
litigation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
post
termination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
time
limits
within
which
that
must
be
held
is
so
short
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
that
inevitably
it
will
have
been
concluded
before
the
case
can
get
to
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know
you
are
right,
but
the
guideline
as
proceeded
by
a
sentence
the
commission
uses
the
following
guidelines
and
you
just
suggest
that’s
not
the
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
not
the
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
dunn,
anything
in
the
record
which
indicates
whether
there
is
a
post
termination
hearing
or
how
soon
the
ultimate
determination,
whether
it
is
made
or
made
at
the
hearing
or
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
would
they
set
up
the
time
before
the
final
decision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
those
decisions,
are
they
written
in
form?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
is
this
procedure
that
you
say
operate
that
the
employer
never
gets
to
post
termination
hearing
until
he
has
paid
up
to
the
date
of
that
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
date
of
the
application?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
us
why
you
are
here
mr.
levy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
tell
us
why
you’re
here
if
that’s
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose
by
the
time
you
got
your
suit
filed,
the
time
for
the
post
termination
hearing
would
have
arrived
and
have
been
concluded
with
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
what
happens
to
the
law
suit
in
the
circuit
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
the
way
they
do
things
in
virginia?
[laughter]

and
that

continue?
