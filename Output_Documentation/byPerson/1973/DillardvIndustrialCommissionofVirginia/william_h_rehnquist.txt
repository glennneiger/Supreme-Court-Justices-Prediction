justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
difference
in
the
position
of
williams
and
dillard
with
respect
to
the
continuing
dispute
in
this
case?
is
there
any?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
appealed
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
he
raise
before
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
his
due
process
contentions
that
he
made
before
the
three-judge
district
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
didn’t
enjoin
travelers
so
you
really
couldn’t
enjoin
and
ask
for
any
money,
could
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
here
if
you
enjoin
travelers
and
preserve
the
claim
for
money
judgment,
it
wouldn’t
have
mooted
out?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
too
in
burns
versus
indiana
employment
security
commission
too,
wasn't
it,
that
was
decided
last
year?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
burney.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
you
enjoin
his
employer?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
can
opt
out
of
this
thing,
can’t
they
by
an
affirmative
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it’s
mandatory
on
both?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
the
interests
of
the
insurer
and
the
employer
always
identical
in
this
situation?
does
the
employer’s
premium
depend
on
his
experience?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
that
i
should
think
of
that
situation,
particularly
a
small
employer
might
not
have
an
identical
interest
with
the
insurer.
he
might
have
an
interest
in
obtaining
compensation
for
an
employee
perhaps
even
when
the
literal
provisions
of
the
law
weren't
complied
with
if
it
is
not
going
to
affect
his
premium.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dunn.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
some
states,
i
believe
the
commission
does
not
only
administers
the
system
but
also
has
its
own
insurance
program
so
that
in
effect
the
commissioners
can
work
two-halves
when
they
are
making
a
decision
to
compensation.
now,
does
virginia
have
a
state
insurance
fund
which
covers
some
employers
or
is
it
all
privately
insured?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
all
of
the
commission
does
basically
is
find
the
facts.
they
don’t
act
as
actuarial
managers
of
an
insurance
fund?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
as
i
read
appellants’
brief
they
agree
that
virginia
could
change
the
law
if
this
thing
were
reversed
and
permit
recoup?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
the
commission
as
of
may
15
finds
their
probable
--
finds
there
is
probable
cause
to
terminate
and
then
the
employee
goes
into
the
circuit
court
and
seeks
to
recover
payments
due
under
the
award
from
may
15th
to
june
1st.
now,
can
the
circuit
court
make
any
independent
review
of
whether
there
was
cause
to
terminate
in
that
sort
of
an
action
as
was
found
by
the
commission’s
determination
of
probable
cause?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
mean
the
employee
could
recover
the
payment
on
a
circuit
court
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what’s
the
purpose
of
notifying
the
employee
if
he
does
not
have
an
opportunity
to
participate
in
the
probable
cause
determination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
my
years
of
practice,
a
judgment
against
travelers
or
against
the
aetna
always
thought
to
be
a
pretty
valuable
thing?
[laughter]
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
you
have
a
judgment
of
the
circuit
court,
don’t
you,
after
you
go
to
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
really,
then
it
is
your
submission
that
there
is
an
undecided
question
of
virginia
law
in
the
case
as
to
what
the
effect
of
a
suit
in
the
circuit
court
during
this
period
of
time
would
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
