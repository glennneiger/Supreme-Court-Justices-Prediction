against
the
industrial
commission
of
virginia
is
an
appeal
from
a
three-judge
court
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia.
the
appellants
there
have
been
receiving
workmen's
compensation
benefits
as
approved
by
the
industrial
commission
of
virginia.
their
benefits
were
suspended
pursuant
to
a
rule
of
the
commission
upon
a
showing
of
probable
cause
that
the
disability
had
terminated.
although,
the
suspension
order
was
ex-parte
and
without
notice,
the
rules
of
the
commission
assured
a
full
administrative
hearing
on
the
merits
prior
to
any
final
termination
of
benefits.
appellants
claim
a
denial
of
procedural
due
process
with
respect
to
the
interim
suspension.
in
our
consideration
of
this
case,
it
appeared
to
the
court
that
persons
aggrieved
by
such
a
suspension,
need
not
await
the
full
administrative
hearing,
but
may
obtain
prompt
enforcement
of
the
original
award
by
going
directly
to
the
appropriate
court.
if
this
reading
of
the
virginia
law
is
correct,
it's
unnecessary
to
address
the
federal
constitutional
question
presented
to
us.
accordingly,
the
judgment
is
vacated
and
the
case
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
reconsideration.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
