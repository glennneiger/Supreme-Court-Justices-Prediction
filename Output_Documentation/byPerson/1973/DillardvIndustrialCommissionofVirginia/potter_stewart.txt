justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words
the
doctor’s
report
has
to
say
that
he
is
able
to
go
back
to
work
now?
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
bram,
as
i
understand
it,
it’s
in
90%
or
so
of
the
cases
compensation
is
agreed
upon
between
the
employer
and
the
employee
and
they
never
go
to
the
state
agency,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
termination
in
the
90%
or
so
the
cases
are
also
by
voluntary
agreement,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
on
those
cases,
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
you
say
they
are
in
which
termination
of
compensation
is
by
voluntary
agreement.
must
that
agreement
then
go
to
the
industrial
commission
to
be
approved
often?
justice
potter
stewart
but
at
anytime
until
after
the
so-called
due
process
hearing
and
the
final
official
termination
by
the
industrial
commission,
the
employee
can
go
into
court
and
collect
under
the
award?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
employer
has
no
defense?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no
date
of
the
application.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
if
the
court
orders
him
to
do
so.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
excuse
me,
excuse
me.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
you
told
us
i
think
of
a
case
where
the
court
awarded
compensation
for
a
period
of
a
year-and-half
after
have
been
back
at
work
simply
because
there
have
been
no
official
termination.
was
this
understood?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
decided
apparently
that
until
there
is
an
official
termination
by
order
of
the
industrial
commission,
the
award
is
in
effect
as
the
manchester
case
holds,
doesn’t
it?
justice

stewart
giving

man
compensation

has
not
been
officially
terminated.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
doesn’t
seem
to
be
common
sense,
but
let’s
close
all
the
interrogation
from
the
bench.
