mr.
john
m.
levy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
appellants.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
procedures
in
virginia
for
the
suspending
of
workmen’s
compensation
benefits
meet
the
requirements
of
procedural
due
process.
the
procedures
which
are
in
effect
now
in
virginia
under
rule
13
of
the
rules
in
industrial
commission
require
that
an
employer
or
a
workmen’s
compensation
carrier
submit
to
the
commission
a
verified
application
for
a
hearing
and
whatever
evidence
it
has
as
to
the
workers’
disability
or
lack
of
disability.
the
commission
will
then
make
an
ex
parte
determination
that
probable
cause
exists
to
believe
that
the
worker
is
no
longer
eligible.
the
lower
three-judge
federal
court
with
one
judge
dissenting
held
that
since
there
was
a
post
suspension
hearing
which
all
parties
agreed
does
provide
due
process,
is
a
judicial-type
hearing,
that
since
there
was
this
hearing
after
the
suspension
that
was
all
the
due
process
required.
appellants’
position
is
that
opportunity
--
notice
which
is
adequate
and
timely
must
be
given
to
the
worker
and
that
he
has
an
opportunity
to
present
his
side
of
the
dispute.
mr.
john
m.
levy
and
meanwhile
payments
continue,
yes.
mr.
john
m.
levy
until
a
determination
is
made
after
a
due
process
hearing.
mr.
john
m.
levy
at
that
stage
they
may
be
terminated.
mr.
john
m.
levy
in
some
instances
we
would
think
that
written
submission
of
documentary
evidence
would
certainly
suffice.
mr.
john
m.
levy
no,
i
think
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
no.
no,
i
do
not
think.
no,
that
is
not
our
position.
an
example
would
be
where
the
insurance
carrier
says
that
he
can
no
longer
be
located.
obviously,
all
that
would
be
required
would
be
a
submission
in
writing,
what
have
you,
that
in
fact
he
can
be
located.
there
are
a
myriad
of
different
factual
situations
in
which
it
arises
and
our
position
is
only
that
adequate
and
timely
notice
must
be
given
and
an
opportunity
to
present
his
side
of
the
dispute.
the
main
plaintiffs
in
this
suit
were
both
injured
on
their
job,
received
workmen’s
compensation
and
award
of
workmen’s
compensation
approved
by
the
commission.
both
had
their
compensation
discontinued.
one
for
a
116
days,
one
for
100
days
and
then
had
it
restored
retroactively
after
the
post
due
process
hearing
was
had.
mr.
john
m.
levy
i
would
think
in
the
amicus
brief
it
says
that
medical
evidence
that
the
doctor
who
treated
the
workers
says,
he
is
able
to
go
back.
this
is
the
most
usual
i
think
statistically
evidence.
mr.
john
m.
levy
i
think
in
most
instances,
what
would
be
required
would
be
the
ability
of
the
worker
to
submit
time
to
get
his
own
medical
evidence
and
submit
it
possibly
a
doctor’s
report,
an
evidentiary
documentary
report.
possibly
there
would
be
instances
where
he
would
need
oral
argument.
there
are
doctors,
the
most,
the
example
that
comes
to
mind
would
be
psychiatric
report
where
oral
argument,
i
think
by
his
counsel
or
even
his
presence
before
the
decider
of
fact
would
be
essential.
mr.
john
m.
levy
well,
the
decider
is
under
virginia
law,
the
industrial
commission
or
an
employee
of
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
no
problem
in
that.
mr.
john
m.
levy
mr.
dillard
settled
his
individual
claim
with
aetna,
his
employer’s
comp
carrier.
mr.
williams
has
taken
his
case
all
the
way
through.
he
has
been
denied
at
the
subsequent
due
process
hearing.
he
has
appealed
that
is
in
it's
adversary
situation
as
opposed
to
his
compensation
carrier.
mr.
john
m.
levy
right,
which
was
denied,
he
has
noted
or
has
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court.
mr.
john
m.
levy
no,
that
was
not
before
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
since
all
he
was
appealing
was
a
finding
by
the
commission
that
he
was
no
longer
disabled.
it
was
not
raised
below.
the
industrial
commission
of
virginia
has
considered
itself
that
issue
and
on
the
strength
of
the
lower
court
opinion
here
found
it.
mr.
john
m.
levy
at
a
post
termination.
mr.
john
m.
levy
most
definitely.
the
post
termination
hearing
provides
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
no.
mr.
john
m.
levy
correct.
a
factual
question
whether
mr.
williams
is
disabled
or
not.
mr.
john
m.
levy
yes
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
levy
that
there
was
no
evidence
before
the
court
--
before
the
commission
to
hold
that
his
evidence
--
that
his
disability
had
ended
and
therefore
denied
him
due
process.
mr.
john
m.
levy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
levy
i
believe
that
this
case
is
not
moot.
there’s
declaratory
relief
asked
for
one
thing.
second
of
all,
this
was
brought
as
a
class
action,
was
determined
as
such
on
remand
from
this
court.
mr.
john
m.
levy
yes,
your
honor.
my
mootness
or
my
response
to
moot
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
that
was
not
asked
for
in
our
complaint.
we
did
not
ask
for
damages.
mr.
john
m.
levy
right.
mr.
john
m.
levy
your
honor,
we
feel
that
this
case
fits
precisely
within
what
mr.
justice
blackmun
spoke
of
in
roe
v.
wade.
it
is
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review.
the
case
would
always
moot
out
as
the
facts
show
within
one
month
or
to
a
year
or
maybe
eight
months.
a
hearing
will
be
held,
a
due
process
hearing
will
be
held.
mr.
john
m.
levy
that
would
have
been
a
possibility.
our
question
is
whether
any
injured
worker
cannot
be
mooted
out
by
having
his
insurance
company
resist
and
withdraw,
pay
him
off,
moot
him
out.
and
this
is
specifically
the
type
of
case
which
will
evade
review
forever.
if
when
a
valid
class
representative
goes
his
--
has
his
procedure
done,
has
his
welfare
benefits,
or
her
pregnancy
terminated,
there
can
be
no
life
in
the
sense
that
i
think
this
court
was
talking
about
in
the
case
before
us,
a
life
plaintiff.
mr.
john
m.
levy
burney.
mr.
john
m.
levy
the
distinguishing
factor
in
burney
and
i
do
not
know
whether
this
is
what
the
court
meant
in
burney
was
here
there
was
an
intervention
of
a
new
member
of
the
class,
mr.
williams.
after
this
court
remanded
back
to
the
lower
court,
to
the
three-judge
court
they
made
a
finding
there’s
a
proper
class,
allowed
intervention.
now,
i
think
arguably
the
intervener
is
in
the
same
position
as
the
original
named
appellant
was.
but
if
this
court
holds
that
this
case
is
moot
on
those
facts,
i
think
it
will
be
flying
in
the
face
of
an
opinion
which
is
just
rendered
i
think
in
january,
american
pipe
and
construction
company
dealing
with
class
actions
and
the
statute
of
limitations.
where
the
court
said
that
a
federal
class
action
is
truly
a
representative
suit
designed
to
protect
against
unnecessary
motions
for
intervention
and
joiner.
what
any
counsel
bringing
a
class
action,
a
civil
right,
a
b2,
rule
23
(b)
(2)
class
action
would
have
to
do
if
this
case
is
moot
would
be
to
file
endless
motions
to
intervene
other
members
of
the
class
and
hope
that
by
the
time
the
case
reach
the
highest,
appellate
level
it
would,
there
would
still
be
someone
who
has
“alive”.
mr.
john
m.
levy
because
a
hearing
is
held.
mr.
john
m.
levy
post
termination
hearing.
mr.
john
m.
levy
is
so
short.
mr.
john
m.
levy
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
levy
correct.
mr.
john
m.
levy
i
would
have
to
agree
that
that
would
be
one
solution
to
this
problem.
mr.
john
m.
levy
correct.
they
could
preserve
the
claim
by
asking
for
monetary
damages.
mr.
john
m.
levy
correct.
the
issue
of
due
process
would
have
been
--
would
be
moot.
mr.
john
m.
levy
correct.
appellant’s
position
is
that
--
i
think
it
is
beyond
argument
that
workmen’s
compensation
benefits
or
property
under
a
long
line
of
cases
that
this
court
has
cited,
i
think
board
of
regents
v.
roth
gives
the
best
definition
and
that
once
this
has
found
that
it
is
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
whatever
process
is
due
has
to
precede
the
deprivation.
the
fatal
defects
in
virginia
system
is
that
there
is
absolutely
no
notice
required
to
be
given
to
the
injured
worker.
the
first
notice
that
he
will
probably
get
is
going
to
his
mailbox
expecting
his
weekly
workmen’s
compensation
check
and
find
that
it
is
not
there
or
he
will
get
a
copy
of
a
letter
to
the
commission
saying
that
it
wants
a
hearing.
mr.
john
m.
levy
under
the
statute
in
virginia,
every
contract
of
employment,
the
whole
workmen’s
compensation
system
is
read
into
every
contract
of
employment.
there
is
no
--
well,
i
do
not
think
employers
require
a
employee
to
sign
their
master
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
for
employment,
correct.
mr.
john
m.
levy
yes
sir.
mr.
john
m.
levy
the
statutes
of
virginia
provide
for
two
ways
to
fulfill
the
duty.
the
duty
is
primarily
on
the
employer.
mr.
john
m.
levy
except
possibly
third
party
beneficiary.
mr.
john
m.
levy
but
each
contract
of
employment
in
virginia
by
statute
has
read
into
it.
mr.
john
m.
levy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
levy
no,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
john
m.
levy
no,
the
statute
of
virginia,
as
the
brief
of
the
amici
for
the
insurance
industry
pointed
that
as
of
january
1,
1974
neither
the
employer
nor
the
employee
can
opt
that.
mr.
john
m.
levy
it’s
mandatory
on
both
sides.
it
used
to
be
that
the
employee
could
opt
out.
the
second
defect
we
find
is
that
without
notice,
there
is
no
opportunity
for
the
employee
for
the
injured
worker
to
present
his
side
of
the
case.
as
was
brought
out
earlier,
the
questions
in
workmen’s
compensation
cases
can
be
very
complex.
for
example,
whether
an
employer,
an
employee
has
unjustifiably
refused
medical
treatment.
what
the
decider
of
fact
that
workmen’s
compens
--
the
industrial
commission
of
virginia
has
before
it
in
this
probable
cause
procedure
is
merely
one
side's,
the
employer
or
carrier
side
of
the
evidence.
there
is
nothing
before
it
under
this
procedure
as
to
the
workers'
justification
for
refusing
a
further
medical
treatment.
i
think
what
this
court
said
in
bell
v.
burson
is
opposite
in
this
sense.
it
is
a
preposition
which
hardly
seems
to
need
explication
that
a
hearing
which
excludes
consideration
of
an
element
essential
to
a
decision
does
not
give
due
process.
in
bell
v.
burson
it
was
fault
in
taking
away
the
driver’s
license.
here,
virginia’s
procedure
excludes
in
this
instance
whether
the
worker
is
justified
or
unjustified.
an
example
cited
at
page
8
of
appellants
apply
to
the
amici
for
the
industry,
the
case
of
thompson
v.
united
piece
&
dye
works,
the
carrier
had
said
the
injured
worker
was
unjustifiably
refusing
a
back
operation.
when
it
got
to
the
commission
and
the
worker
was
able
to
submit
his
side,
it
was
shown
that
this
worker
had
undergone
three
prior
back
operations
with
no
improvement
and
the
commission
i
think
obviously
found,
of
course,
he
was
justified
in
refusing
to
go
through
another
one.
also,
there
are
questions
which
are
able
to
be
determined
very
summarily
such
as
the
example
i
gave
of
whether
the
worker
is
no
longer
can
be
found.
what
we
are
asking
this
court
to
do
as
it
is
done
in
most
of
the
procedural
due
process
cases,
is
to
set
the
broad
perimeters
of
what
due
process
requires
notice
and
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
a
meaningful
manner.
as
i
think
the
court
said
in
fuentes,
it
is
peculiarly
the
state's
function
to
set
the
procedures
exactly,
balance
the
interest
as
to
how
much
--
how
close
to
a
judicial
type
proceeding
it
should
be.
and
this
court
though
i
feel
should
give
the
broad
outlines,
the
basic
fundamental
and
basic
fairness
as
the
court
reasonably
said
in
groppi
which
procedural
due
process
has
always
required.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
john
m.
levy
i
would
not
agree
with
it.
i
am
no
expert
on
the
insurance
industry
side.
i
would
not
think
that
the
lack
of
good
--
i
would
not
pose
it
a
lack
of
good
faith
on
the
insurance
industry.
i
think
the
amicus
brief
shows
that
there
is
95%
of
workmen’s
compensation
benefits
at
all
ends
of
its
inception
and
termination
are
voluntarily
settled,
and
i
do
not
see
any
reason
to
believe
that
any
or
much
greater
percentage
would
--
this
percentage
would
change
with
the
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
john
m.
levy
there
is
some
ambiguity
in
the
record.
what
the
lower
court
found
was
an
average
of
one
month
delay.
the
answers
to
interrogatory
is
i
think
would
--
in
the
appendix
would
bear
a
reading
that
there
is
probably
more
delay,
probably
closer
to
three
or
four
months.
the
interrogatories
were
framed
in
a
variety
of
fact
situations,
but
the
lower
court
found
one
month
delay.
thank
you.
mr.
john
m.
levy
i
might
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
pardon
me?
mr.
john
m.
levy
first
of
all
there
has
absolutely
no
litigation
under
section
100
under
a
rule
13
procedure.
if
the
employer
and
the
employee
went
to
court
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
pending
a
hearing,
once
the
benefits
are
suspended,
there
has
been
no
determination
as
to
what
the
court
would
do.
after
the
due
process
hearing,
the
court
might
look
at
it
this
way.
after
the
due
process
hearing
the
commission
terminates
the
award
retroactively,
therefore,
there
would
be
nothing.
it
would
be
like
going
into
enforce
something
which
there
is
a
preliminary
injunction
on.
mr.
john
m.
levy
the
court
under
that
statute
--
the
language
of
that
statute
would
have
to
enter
a
judgment.
the
employee
would
then
have
to
try
to
collect
under
that
judgment
and
i
would
assume
that
there
would
be
no
law
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
well
you
have
--
before
you
a
judgment
of
the
commission
to
pay
until
disability
is
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
but
still
you
have
a
judgment
and
i
would
assume
that
court
would
say
if
there
is
a
hearing
--
when
this
hearing
comes
effect,
we
are
not
going
to
force
travelers
to
pay
since
the
very
basis
for
that
decision
will
be
terminated
retroactively.
mr.
john
m.
levy
well,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
whole
intent
of
that
statute
could
be
interpreted
in
no
other
way.
mr.
john
m.
levy
that
is
another
aspect.
mr.
john
m.
levy
that
is
an
undecided
question
of
state
law,
certainly.
mr.
john
m.
levy
this
is
prior
to
rule
13.
mr.
john
m.
levy
but
there
has
been
no
litigation
first
under
the
old
rule
13
and
certainly
under
the
new
rule
13
and
it
would
defy
common
sense
for
the
virginia
courts
to
hold
that
you
will
give
a
judgment
and
let
it
be
collected
when
that
judgment
is
going
to
be
or
possibly
will
be
retroactively
terminated.
mr.
john
m.
levy
correct.
mr.
john
m.
levy
it
is
not
meaningless
to
the
injured
worker.
this
order
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
it
affects
legally
before
a
court,
a
circuit
court
in
virginia
that
is
a
question
of
what
the
effect
that
is,
but
in
actuality
he
suspect
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
one
other
response
that
i
would
like
to
make
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
levy
we
are
asking
that
this
court
say
that
rule
13
does
not
provide
due
process
by
in
reality
terminates
suspending
benefits.
mr.
john
m.
levy
we
will
get
another
judgment
which
is
a
ministerial
act
of
the
court
which
any
insurance
company
will
treat
the
same
way
as
the
judgment
of
the
commission.
and
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
yes,
there
are
the
traditional
common
law
remedies
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
yes
attachment.
mr.
john
m.
levy
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
levy
no,
your
honor.
what
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
we
want
a
notice.
first
of
all
the
fact
that
there
is
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
no.
[laughter]
mr.
john
m.
levy
no.
what
we
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
certainly,
but
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
i
think
that
is
not
clear
in
virginia
law.
second
of
all,
that
does
not
solve
the
problem
of
notice.
mr.
john
m.
levy
yes,
but
you
have
to
have,
you
have
to
go
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
no,
but
the
filing
of
the
court
--
the
papers
in
the
court
does
not
give
you
the
money.
that
is
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
the
procedure
is
--
yes,
you
are
right.
[laughter]
no,
i
am
sorry
no
that
is,
of
course,
not
our
position.
the
procedures
which
in
reality
are,
in
effect,
in
virginia
show
that
benefits
are
paid,
this
goes
to
the
voluntariness
of
the
system.
if
this
is
the
position
that
is
being
required
or
would
be
required
in
the
court
then
you
would
have
a
procedure
which
would
draw
the
workmen’s
compensation
system
all
out
of
quilters
as
the
national
commission
on
workmen’s
compensation
said.
the
industrial
commission
of
virginia
does
not
have
“enforcement
power”
meaning
that
the
state
of
virginia
setup
their
system
so
that
the
commission
would
not
go
out
and
attach
insurance
company’s
property.
they
gave
that
that
power
or
they
left
that
power
alone
in
the
court
and
that
is
the
only
thing
that
section
100
of
the
code
gives.
it’s
just
the
very
rare
instance
and
the
only
litigation
that
could
be
found
under
that
is
30
years
old.
this
is
just
leaving
with
the
traditional
common
law
of
court,
the
power
to
garnishee,
to
attach
property
and
all
of
that.
this
system
works
under
a
voluntary
system
with
penalties
which
are
assessed
against
insurance
companies
for
not
paying
when
due
with
the
ability
of
the
state
corporation
commission
to
pull
an
insurance
company's
license
if
they
are
not
meeting
their
obligation
under
this
procedure.
mr.
john
m.
levy
no,
by
the
very
fact
that
it
is
complicated
and
takes
too
long,
the
plaintiffs
in
goldberg
had
a
procedure.
they
could
have
gone
in
to
federal
court
and
enforced
their
welfare.
mr.
john
m.
levy
no.
mr.
john
m.
levy
it
was
not
a
contractual
case.
the
plaintiffs
in
point
at
the
time
is
what
we
are
talking
about
and
that
is
what
procedural
due
process
within
a
prior
hearing
is
what
we
are
talking
about
and
we
do
not
have
that
in
virginia.
mr.
john
m.
levy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
appellants.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
procedures
in
virginia
for
the
suspending
of
workmen’s
compensation
benefits
meet
the
requirements
of
procedural
due
process.
the
procedures
which
are
in
effect
now
in
virginia
under
rule
13
of
the
rules
in
industrial
commission
require
that
an
employer
or
a
workmen’s
compensation
carrier
submit
to
the
commission
a
verified
application
for
a
hearing
and
whatever
evidence
it
has
as
to
the
workers’
disability
or
lack
of
disability.
the
commission
will
then
make
an
ex
parte
determination
that
probable
cause
exists
to
believe
that
the
worker
is
no
longer
eligible.
the
lower
three-judge
federal
court
with
one
judge
dissenting
held
that
since
there
was
a
post
suspension
hearing
which
all
parties
agreed
does
provide
due
process,
is
a
judicial-type
hearing,
that
since
there
was
this
hearing
after
the
suspension
that
was
all
the
due
process
required.
appellants’
position
is
that
opportunity
--
notice
which
is
adequate
and
timely
must
be
given
to
the
worker
and
that
he
has
an
opportunity
to
present
his
side
of
the
dispute.
mr.
john
m.
levy
and
meanwhile
payments
continue,
yes.
mr.
john
m.
levy
until
a
determination
is
made
after
a
due
process
hearing.
mr.
john
m.
levy
at
that
stage
they
may
be
terminated.
mr.
john
m.
levy
in
some
instances
we
would
think
that
written
submission
of
documentary
evidence
would
certainly
suffice.
mr.
john
m.
levy
no,
i
think
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
no.
no,
i
do
not
think.
no,
that
is
not
our
position.
an
example
would
be
where
the
insurance
carrier
says
that
he
can
no
longer
be
located.
obviously,
all
that
would
be
required
would
be
a
submission
in
writing,
what
have
you,
that
in
fact
he
can
be
located.
there
are
a
myriad
of
different
factual
situations
in
which
it
arises
and
our
position
is
only
that
adequate
and
timely
notice
must
be
given
and
an
opportunity
to
present
his
side
of
the
dispute.
the
main
plaintiffs
in
this
suit
were
both
injured
on
their
job,
received
workmen’s
compensation
and
award
of
workmen’s
compensation
approved
by
the
commission.
both
had
their
compensation
discontinued.
one
for
a
116
days,
one
for
100
days
and
then
had
it
restored
retroactively
after
the
post
due
process
hearing
was
had.
mr.
john
m.
levy
i
would
think
in
the
amicus
brief
it
says
that
medical
evidence
that
the
doctor
who
treated
the
workers
says,
he
is
able
to
go
back.
this
is
the
most
usual
i
think
statistically
evidence.
mr.
john
m.
levy
i
think
in
most
instances,
what
would
be
required
would
be
the
ability
of
the
worker
to
submit
time
to
get
his
own
medical
evidence
and
submit
it
possibly
a
doctor’s
report,
an
evidentiary
documentary
report.
possibly
there
would
be
instances
where
he
would
need
oral
argument.
there
are
doctors,
the
most,
the
example
that
comes
to
mind
would
be
psychiatric
report
where
oral
argument,
i
think
by
his
counsel
or
even
his
presence
before
the
decider
of
fact
would
be
essential.
mr.
john
m.
levy
well,
the
decider
is
under
virginia
law,
the
industrial
commission
or
an
employee
of
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
no
problem
in
that.
mr.
john
m.
levy
mr.
dillard
settled
his
individual
claim
with
aetna,
his
employer’s
comp
carrier.
mr.
williams
has
taken
his
case
all
the
way
through.
he
has
been
denied
at
the
subsequent
due
process
hearing.
he
has
appealed
that
is
in
it's
adversary
situation
as
opposed
to
his
compensation
carrier.
mr.
john
m.
levy
right,
which
was
denied,
he
has
noted
or
has
filed
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
court.
mr.
john
m.
levy
no,
that
was
not
before
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
since
all
he
was
appealing
was
a
finding
by
the
commission
that
he
was
no
longer
disabled.
it
was
not
raised
below.
the
industrial
commission
of
virginia
has
considered
itself
that
issue
and
on
the
strength
of
the
lower
court
opinion
here
found
it.
mr.
john
m.
levy
at
a
post
termination.
mr.
john
m.
levy
most
definitely.
the
post
termination
hearing
provides
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
no.
mr.
john
m.
levy
correct.
a
factual
question
whether
mr.
williams
is
disabled
or
not.
mr.
john
m.
levy
yes
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
levy
that
there
was
no
evidence
before
the
court
--
before
the
commission
to
hold
that
his
evidence
--
that
his
disability
had
ended
and
therefore
denied
him
due
process.
mr.
john
m.
levy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
levy
i
believe
that
this
case
is
not
moot.
there’s
declaratory
relief
asked
for
one
thing.
second
of
all,
this
was
brought
as
a
class
action,
was
determined
as
such
on
remand
from
this
court.
mr.
john
m.
levy
yes,
your
honor.
my
mootness
or
my
response
to
moot
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
that
was
not
asked
for
in
our
complaint.
we
did
not
ask
for
damages.
mr.
john
m.
levy
right.
mr.
john
m.
levy
your
honor,
we
feel
that
this
case
fits
precisely
within
what
mr.
justice
blackmun
spoke
of
in
roe
v.
wade.
it
is
capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review.
the
case
would
always
moot
out
as
the
facts
show
within
one
month
or
to
a
year
or
maybe
eight
months.
a
hearing
will
be
held,
a
due
process
hearing
will
be
held.
mr.
john
m.
levy
that
would
have
been
a
possibility.
our
question
is
whether
any
injured
worker
cannot
be
mooted
out
by
having
his
insurance
company
resist
and
withdraw,
pay
him
off,
moot
him
out.
and
this
is
specifically
the
type
of
case
which
will
evade
review
forever.
if
when
a
valid
class
representative
goes
his
--
has
his
procedure
done,
has
his
welfare
benefits,
or
her
pregnancy
terminated,
there
can
be
no
life
in
the
sense
that
i
think
this
court
was
talking
about
in
the
case
before
us,
a
life
plaintiff.
mr.
john
m.
levy
burney.
mr.
john
m.
levy
the
distinguishing
factor
in
burney
and
i
do
not
know
whether
this
is
what
the
court
meant
in
burney
was
here
there
was
an
intervention
of
a
new
member
of
the
class,
mr.
williams.
after
this
court
remanded
back
to
the
lower
court,
to
the
three-judge
court
they
made
a
finding
there’s
a
proper
class,
allowed
intervention.
now,
i
think
arguably
the
intervener
is
in
the
same
position
as
the
original
named
appellant
was.
but
if
this
court
holds
that
this
case
is
moot
on
those
facts,
i
think
it
will
be
flying
in
the
face
of
an
opinion
which
is
just
rendered
i
think
in
january,
american
pipe
and
construction
company
dealing
with
class
actions
and
the
statute
of
limitations.
where
the
court
said
that
a
federal
class
action
is
truly
a
representative
suit
designed
to
protect
against
unnecessary
motions
for
intervention
and
joiner.
what
any
counsel
bringing
a
class
action,
a
civil
right,
a
b2,
rule
23
(b)
(2)
class
action
would
have
to
do
if
this
case
is
moot
would
be
to
file
endless
motions
to
intervene
other
members
of
the
class
and
hope
that
by
the
time
the
case
reach
the
highest,
appellate
level
it
would,
there
would
still
be
someone
who
has
“alive”.
mr.
john
m.
levy
because
a
hearing
is
held.
mr.
john
m.
levy
post
termination
hearing.
mr.
john
m.
levy
is
so
short.
mr.
john
m.
levy
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
levy
correct.
mr.
john
m.
levy
i
would
have
to
agree
that
that
would
be
one
solution
to
this
problem.
mr.
john
m.
levy
correct.
they
could
preserve
the
claim
by
asking
for
monetary
damages.
mr.
john
m.
levy
correct.
the
issue
of
due
process
would
have
been
--
would
be
moot.
mr.
john
m.
levy
correct.
appellant’s
position
is
that
--
i
think
it
is
beyond
argument
that
workmen’s
compensation
benefits
or
property
under
a
long
line
of
cases
that
this
court
has
cited,
i
think
board
of
regents
v.
roth
gives
the
best
definition
and
that
once
this
has
found
that
it
is
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
whatever
process
is
due
has
to
precede
the
deprivation.
the
fatal
defects
in
virginia
system
is
that
there
is
absolutely
no
notice
required
to
be
given
to
the
injured
worker.
the
first
notice
that
he
will
probably
get
is
going
to
his
mailbox
expecting
his
weekly
workmen’s
compensation
check
and
find
that
it
is
not
there
or
he
will
get
a
copy
of
a
letter
to
the
commission
saying
that
it
wants
a
hearing.
mr.
john
m.
levy
under
the
statute
in
virginia,
every
contract
of
employment,
the
whole
workmen’s
compensation
system
is
read
into
every
contract
of
employment.
there
is
no
--
well,
i
do
not
think
employers
require
a
employee
to
sign
their
master
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
for
employment,
correct.
mr.
john
m.
levy
yes
sir.
mr.
john
m.
levy
the
statutes
of
virginia
provide
for
two
ways
to
fulfill
the
duty.
the
duty
is
primarily
on
the
employer.
mr.
john
m.
levy
except
possibly
third
party
beneficiary.
mr.
john
m.
levy
but
each
contract
of
employment
in
virginia
by
statute
has
read
into
it.
mr.
john
m.
levy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
levy
no,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
john
m.
levy
no,
the
statute
of
virginia,
as
the
brief
of
the
amici
for
the
insurance
industry
pointed
that
as
of
january
1,
1974
neither
the
employer
nor
the
employee
can
opt
that.
mr.
john
m.
levy
it’s
mandatory
on
both
sides.
it
used
to
be
that
the
employee
could
opt
out.
the
second
defect
we
find
is
that
without
notice,
there
is
no
opportunity
for
the
employee
for
the
injured
worker
to
present
his
side
of
the
case.
as
was
brought
out
earlier,
the
questions
in
workmen’s
compensation
cases
can
be
very
complex.
for
example,
whether
an
employer,
an
employee
has
unjustifiably
refused
medical
treatment.
what
the
decider
of
fact
that
workmen’s
compens
--
the
industrial
commission
of
virginia
has
before
it
in
this
probable
cause
procedure
is
merely
one
side's,
the
employer
or
carrier
side
of
the
evidence.
there
is
nothing
before
it
under
this
procedure
as
to
the
workers'
justification
for
refusing
a
further
medical
treatment.
i
think
what
this
court
said
in
bell
v.
burson
is
opposite
in
this
sense.
it
is
a
preposition
which
hardly
seems
to
need
explication
that
a
hearing
which
excludes
consideration
of
an
element
essential
to
a
decision
does
not
give
due
process.
in
bell
v.
burson
it
was
fault
in
taking
away
the
driver’s
license.
here,
virginia’s
procedure
excludes
in
this
instance
whether
the
worker
is
justified
or
unjustified.
an
example
cited
at
page
8
of
appellants
apply
to
the
amici
for
the
industry,
the
case
of
thompson
v.
united
piece
&
dye
works,
the
carrier
had
said
the
injured
worker
was
unjustifiably
refusing
a
back
operation.
when
it
got
to
the
commission
and
the
worker
was
able
to
submit
his
side,
it
was
shown
that
this
worker
had
undergone
three
prior
back
operations
with
no
improvement
and
the
commission
i
think
obviously
found,
of
course,
he
was
justified
in
refusing
to
go
through
another
one.
also,
there
are
questions
which
are
able
to
be
determined
very
summarily
such
as
the
example
i
gave
of
whether
the
worker
is
no
longer
can
be
found.
what
we
are
asking
this
court
to
do
as
it
is
done
in
most
of
the
procedural
due
process
cases,
is
to
set
the
broad
perimeters
of
what
due
process
requires
notice
and
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
in
a
meaningful
manner.
as
i
think
the
court
said
in
fuentes,
it
is
peculiarly
the
state's
function
to
set
the
procedures
exactly,
balance
the
interest
as
to
how
much
--
how
close
to
a
judicial
type
proceeding
it
should
be.
and
this
court
though
i
feel
should
give
the
broad
outlines,
the
basic
fundamental
and
basic
fairness
as
the
court
reasonably
said
in
groppi
which
procedural
due
process
has
always
required.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
john
m.
levy
i
would
not
agree
with
it.
i
am
no
expert
on
the
insurance
industry
side.
i
would
not
think
that
the
lack
of
good
--
i
would
not
pose
it
a
lack
of
good
faith
on
the
insurance
industry.
i
think
the
amicus
brief
shows
that
there
is
95%
of
workmen’s
compensation
benefits
at
all
ends
of
its
inception
and
termination
are
voluntarily
settled,
and
i
do
not
see
any
reason
to
believe
that
any
or
much
greater
percentage
would
--
this
percentage
would
change
with
the
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
john
m.
levy
there
is
some
ambiguity
in
the
record.
what
the
lower
court
found
was
an
average
of
one
month
delay.
the
answers
to
interrogatory
is
i
think
would
--
in
the
appendix
would
bear
a
reading
that
there
is
probably
more
delay,
probably
closer
to
three
or
four
months.
the
interrogatories
were
framed
in
a
variety
of
fact
situations,
but
the
lower
court
found
one
month
delay.
thank
you.
mr.
john
m.
levy
i
might
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
pardon
me?
mr.
john
m.
levy
first
of
all
there
has
absolutely
no
litigation
under
section
100
under
a
rule
13
procedure.
if
the
employer
and
the
employee
went
to
court
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
pending
a
hearing,
once
the
benefits
are
suspended,
there
has
been
no
determination
as
to
what
the
court
would
do.
after
the
due
process
hearing,
the
court
might
look
at
it
this
way.
after
the
due
process
hearing
the
commission
terminates
the
award
retroactively,
therefore,
there
would
be
nothing.
it
would
be
like
going
into
enforce
something
which
there
is
a
preliminary
injunction
on.
mr.
john
m.
levy
the
court
under
that
statute
--
the
language
of
that
statute
would
have
to
enter
a
judgment.
the
employee
would
then
have
to
try
to
collect
under
that
judgment
and
i
would
assume
that
there
would
be
no
law
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
well
you
have
--
before
you
a
judgment
of
the
commission
to
pay
until
disability
is
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
but
still
you
have
a
judgment
and
i
would
assume
that
court
would
say
if
there
is
a
hearing
--
when
this
hearing
comes
effect,
we
are
not
going
to
force
travelers
to
pay
since
the
very
basis
for
that
decision
will
be
terminated
retroactively.
mr.
john
m.
levy
well,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
whole
intent
of
that
statute
could
be
interpreted
in
no
other
way.
mr.
john
m.
levy
that
is
another
aspect.
mr.
john
m.
levy
that
is
an
undecided
question
of
state
law,
certainly.
mr.
john
m.
levy
this
is
prior
to
rule
13.
mr.
john
m.
levy
but
there
has
been
no
litigation
first
under
the
old
rule
13
and
certainly
under
the
new
rule
13
and
it
would
defy
common
sense
for
the
virginia
courts
to
hold
that
you
will
give
a
judgment
and
let
it
be
collected
when
that
judgment
is
going
to
be
or
possibly
will
be
retroactively
terminated.
mr.
john
m.
levy
correct.
mr.
john
m.
levy
it
is
not
meaningless
to
the
injured
worker.
this
order
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
it
affects
legally
before
a
court,
a
circuit
court
in
virginia
that
is
a
question
of
what
the
effect
that
is,
but
in
actuality
he
suspect
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
one
other
response
that
i
would
like
to
make
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
levy
we
are
asking
that
this
court
say
that
rule
13
does
not
provide
due
process
by
in
reality
terminates
suspending
benefits.
mr.
john
m.
levy
we
will
get
another
judgment
which
is
a
ministerial
act
of
the
court
which
any
insurance
company
will
treat
the
same
way
as
the
judgment
of
the
commission.
and
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
yes,
there
are
the
traditional
common
law
remedies
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
yes
attachment.
mr.
john
m.
levy
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
levy
no,
your
honor.
what
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
we
want
a
notice.
first
of
all
the
fact
that
there
is
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
no.
[laughter]
mr.
john
m.
levy
no.
what
we
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
certainly,
but
i
don’t
think
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
i
think
that
is
not
clear
in
virginia
law.
second
of
all,
that
does
not
solve
the
problem
of
notice.
mr.
john
m.
levy
yes,
but
you
have
to
have,
you
have
to
go
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
no,
but
the
filing
of
the
court
--
the
papers
in
the
court
does
not
give
you
the
money.
that
is
--
mr.
john
m.
levy
the
procedure
is
--
yes,
you
are
right.
[laughter]
no,
i
am
sorry
no
that
is,
of
course,
not
our
position.
the
procedures
which
in
reality
are,
in
effect,
in
virginia
show
that
benefits
are
paid,
this
goes
to
the
voluntariness
of
the
system.
if
this
is
the
position
that
is
being
required
or
would
be
required
in
the
court
then
you
would
have
a
procedure
which
would
draw
the
workmen’s
compensation
system
all
out
of
quilters
as
the
national
commission
on
workmen’s
compensation
said.
the
industrial
commission
of
virginia
does
not
have
“enforcement
power”
meaning
that
the
state
of
virginia
setup
their
system
so
that
the
commission
would
not
go
out
and
attach
insurance
company’s
property.
they
gave
that
that
power
or
they
left
that
power
alone
in
the
court
and
that
is
the
only
thing
that
section
100
of
the
code
gives.
it’s
just
the
very
rare
instance
and
the
only
litigation
that
could
be
found
under
that
is
30
years
old.
this
is
just
leaving
with
the
traditional
common
law
of
court,
the
power
to
garnishee,
to
attach
property
and
all
of
that.
this
system
works
under
a
voluntary
system
with
penalties
which
are
assessed
against
insurance
companies
for
not
paying
when
due
with
the
ability
of
the
state
corporation
commission
to
pull
an
insurance
company's
license
if
they
are
not
meeting
their
obligation
under
this
procedure.
mr.
john
m.
levy
no,
by
the
very
fact
that
it
is
complicated
and
takes
too
long,
the
plaintiffs
in
goldberg
had
a
procedure.
they
could
have
gone
in
to
federal
court
and
enforced
their
welfare.
mr.
john
m.
levy
no.
mr.
john
m.
levy
it
was
not
a
contractual
case.
the
plaintiffs
in
point
at
the
time
is
what
we
are
talking
about
and
that
is
what
procedural
due
process
within
a
prior
hearing
is
what
we
are
talking
about
and
we
do
not
have
that
in
virginia.
