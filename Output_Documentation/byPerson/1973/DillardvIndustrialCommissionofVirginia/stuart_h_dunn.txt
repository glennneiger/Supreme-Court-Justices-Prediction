mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
address
myself
to
the
question
basically
of
the
due
process
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
brame,
representing
aetna
with
the
permission
of
the
court
will
address
himself
to
the
jurisdictional
points
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
property
right
here
and
whether
or
not
it
has
been
taken.
at
the
outset,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
yellow
brief
of
the
amici
of
american
insurance
association
and
the
american
mutual
insurance
alliance,
page
15
where
there
is
factual
error.
this
is
in
the
guidelines
where
they
set
out
five
guidelines,
and
the
statement
is
found
on
line
four.
“the
doctor’s
medical
report
must
indicate
that
the
employee
can
return
to
work
within
seven
days.
speculation
as
to
the
employee’s
condition
further
in
the
future
will
not
support
a
probable
cause
finding.”
apparently,
there
is
simply
a
lack
of
communication
between
the
amici
in
this
case
and
the
industrial
commission.
the
industrial
commission
takes
the
position
that
this
is
in
fact
not
true.
there
is
no
ability
for
prospective
determination.
no
doctor
can
say,
i
believe
that
this
employee
will
be
able
to
go
back
to
work
in
three
or
four
days
or
seven
or
fifteen
days
and
obtain
a
probable
cause
finding
on
that.
there
is
absolutely
no
prospective
result.
there
are
other
less
substantial
errors,
but
i
think
this
only
one
that
bears
a
comment.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
yes,
sir.
perhaps
the
seven
days
is
a
confusion
between
this
process
and
the
process
whereby
an
employee
must
be
off
work
more
than
seven
days
before
he
ever
gets
into
being
eligible
for
workmen’s
compensation
benefits.
that’s
just
speculation
of
my
part.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
your
honor
that’s
--
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
that
is
not
the
case
your
honor
with
respect
to
this
comment
with
the
--
and
also
with
respect
to
several
others
that
are
not
as
substantial,
but
this
was
apparently
based
on
communications
between
the
amici
and
the
commission
which
we
were
not
a
party
to.
i
believe
the
important
note
--
what
we
think
is
important
about
this
case
in
that
is
fairly
unique
and
it's
unique
for
this
reason.
first
of
all,
there
is
the
probable
cause
determination
under
rule
13.
the
second
thing
is
with
respect
to
the
what
amounts
to
a
tripartite
rights
and
property.
we
have
the
interest
of
course
of
the
employee,
the
interest
of
the
employer
and
we
have
the
interest
of
the
government.
i
think
to
understand
the
way
that
this
system
actually
works,
one
needs
to
look
at
what
exactly
workmen’s
compensation
is
and
if
i
may
spend
just
a
few
moments
outlining
the
way
the
system
works
in
virginia.
of
course
workmen’s
compensation
is
basically
a
substitute
for
common
law
tort
and
under
this
procedure,
the
basic
changes
regarding
the
fact
the
employee
no
longer
has
a
certain
tort
and
therefore
would
not
get
as
much
money
perhaps
in
particular
cases
on
the
workmen’s
compensation
he
would
get
under
common
law.
on
the
other
hand,
the
employer
gives
up
certain
defenses
such
as
the
doctrine
of
fellow
servant,
of
contributory
negligence,
and
so
forth
and
therefore
there
is
at
least
compensation
on
every
case
in
industrial
accident.
the
system
provides
basically
for
two
types
of
payment:
one
a
medical;
the
second
is
temporary
compensation.
now,
they
may
in
fact
be
permanent
incapacity.
the
provision
on
the
law,
there
will
be
a
rating
of
a
percentage
of
capacity
and
there
will
be
payments
on
the
basis
of
that,
but
up
until
a
doctor
is
able
to
rate
an
employee,
there
will
be
temporary
compensation.
the
statute
provides
for
payment
during
incapacity.
the
award
in
the
case
of
mr.
williams
and
mr.
dillard
provides
for
payment
during
incapacity.
so
then
as
to
be
anticipated
that
this
payment
will
not
go
on
forever
and
that
in
fact
there
are
generally
three
ways
in
which
it
will
end,
one
is
of
course
that
the
employee
recovers
and
is
able
to
go
back
to
work.
secondly,
it
is
clear
that
he
has
progressed
to
whatever
point
he
is
going
to
with
respect
to
his
incapacity
and
is
rated.
or
third,
he
may
have
been
partially
incapacitated
for
the
entire
statutory
period
of
500
weeks
and
essentially
his
famous
will
run
out
under
that
system.
now,
with
respect
to
a
question
that
justice
blackmun
raised,
this
gets
me
really
to
my
next
point.
this
is
what
we
think
is
the
touchstone
of
the
system
of
virginia
and
what
makes
it
work
as
well
as
it
does
and
that
is
voluntariness.
as
counsel
for
the
appellants
have
already
suggested
roughly
95%
of
the
cases
are
decided
without
any
opinion
or
handled
by
the
employer,
the
employee
and
the
insurance
companies
act
in
good
faith.
now,
mr.
levy
has
suggested
in
his
reply
brief
and
also
he
suggested
in
response
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question
that
he
would
not
impute
any
bad
faith.
we
submit
that’s
not
the
problem.
the
problem
is
that
at
the
present
time
it
is
in
the
insurance
company’s
self-interest
and
in
the
employers’
self-interest
to
very
properly
undertake
payment
to
an
employee
and
in
workmen’s
comp
situation.
this
is
done
because
it
is
a
moral
factor
for
the
employee.
the
employer
likes
to
get
the
employee
getting
favor
soon
and
in
fact
the
commission
knows
that
often
payment
is
made
to
the
employee
prior
to
there
even
being
an
award.
now,
this
is
also
based
on
the
fact
that
if
the
employer
finds
out
that
there’s
been
some
sort
of
mistake,
the
representation
of
the
employer
turns
out
to
be
something
different
from
what
has
been
represented,
it
is
readily
easy
to
terminate
this.
of
course
under
the
present
system
where
there
has
been
change
of
condition,
he
can
terminate
it
and
set
it
for
hearing.
we
submit
that
the
problem
will
be
not
simply
as
you
have
in
goldberg,
you
will
have
a
hearing
every
time
somebody
wants
one,
that’s
not
all
you’ll
have.
you'll
have
all
of
the
extra
hearings
from
the
people
who
want
them
and
then
on
top
of
that
you
will
have
all
the
hearings
with
a
cause
on
the
front
end,
not
because
of
any
bad
faith,
but
simply
because
it
has
become
in
the
insurance
companies
and
employers'
economic
self
interest
to
look
much
harder
at
the
claim
before
they
ever
take
it
to
be
sure
that
this
is
a
compensable
claim.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
the
system
in
virginia
is
that
it's
value
rated
by
industry.
for
example,
all
employers
of
bricklayers
would
pay
a
sum
of
a
premium
as
all
other
employers
of
bricklayers,
but
they
might
not
pay
the
same
premium
as
metalworkers.
so
that
an
individual
company's
experience
will
not
affect
its
insurance
premium,
but
the
industry
experience
will.
now,
to
that
extent,
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you
raise
a
good
point
to
separate
the
insurance
company
from
the
self-employer
or
self-insured
employer.
the
self
insured
employer
of
course
across
the
street
from
each
to
competitors,
one
having
a
claim
and
they
although
not
may
be
in
a
competitive
situation
such
that
he
can’t
absorb.
it
maybe
a
small
business,
just
simply
cannot
absorb
it.
this,
of
course,
wouldn’t
happen
were
they
were
insurance
companies
because
the
competitive
angle
is
then
gone.
that
is
every
other
bricklayer
has
got
to
pay
the
same
premium
if
they
are
inflated
as
this
bricklayer
does.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
he
would
not,
but
his
carrier
of
course
would
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
it
and
the
employer
has
the
interest
to
the
extent
that
he
would
not
want
his
premium
to
go
up
which
it
necessarily
would
as
a
result
of
this
system.
it
would
be
quite
easy
for
any
employee
of
simply
to
say
no
when
asked
of
his
change
of
condition
had
occurred
and
ask
for
the
hearing.
i
might
further
respond
as
far
as
the
time
limit
is
concerned,
i
don’t
think
in
fact
that
the
interrogatories
reflect
with
the
time
limit
is.
i
think
it
is
interrogatory
number
14
is
the
answer
to
the
question
about
what
is
the
time
limit
for
change
of
condition
hearings
and
that
is
what
is
the
delay
between
their
request
for
the
hearing
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
and
the
answer
of
this
is
to
refer
it
back
to
answer
six
and
answer
six
refers
the
interrogatory
to
the
fact
that
these
records
are
simply
not
available
in
that
form
and
they
could
come
to
the
office.
so
what
we
end
up
with
is
simply
no
statistics
in
the
record
to
show
what
the
delay
is.
the
commission
was
unable
to
obtain
them
without
going
through
all
of
its
files.
there
are
some
other
statistics
with
respect
to
the
one
month
and
the
one
to
three
months
and
i
might
say
based
on
my
own
knowledge
having
been
advised
by
my
client
that
these
are
probably
in
the
ballpark
for
these
types
of
hearings
as
well,
but
they
are
not,
there
has
been
no
statistics
in
the
record
as
such.
the
important
thing,
we
think
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
voluntariness
with
respect
to
the
increased
litigation
which
the
commission
expects
to
occur
is
the
fact
that
this
is
not
in
the
employee’s
best
interest.
the
commission
in
a
sense
is
biased
towards
the
employee,
that
is
really
has
raised
on
deterrence.
that’s
what
is
there
for
the
rules
and
the
statute
make
it
very
clear
it’s
very
liberal
for
the
employee,
heresy
evidence
can
be
presented
by
the
employee,
all
sorts
of
loosening
of
normal
judicial
constraints
of
their
--
and
the
commission
believes
it
will
not
be
in
employee’s
best
interest
in
the
sense
that
the
employee
for
example
often
will
have
returned
to
work
by
the
time
he
will
have
ever
got
his
hearing
if
the
insurance
company
denies
that
they
have
a
claim.
often,
these
actions
don’t
incapacitate
the
employee
for
more
than
several
weeks
or
several
months
and
he
is
likely
to
be
back
at
work.
if
he
of
course
has
been
living
on
his
income
and
he
has
no
savings
he
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
to
that.
the
very
argument
which
the
appellants
made
for
having
the
benefits
continue
comes
back
on
the
front
end
to
show
that
it’s
a
very
good
reason
for
not
having
it
work
that
way.
now,
as
far
as
the
--
again,
the
employer
or
insurance
company’s
ability
to
abuse
this
process,
one
can’t
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
probable
cause
to
termination
by
a
disinterested,
perhaps
even
biased
towards
the
employee
party.
and
another
important
thing
to
note
is
with
respect
to
this
case
is
that
all
of
the
actions
which
took
place
with
respect
to
these
two
appellants
took
place
prior
to
amended
rule
13.
that
is
under
old
rule
13,
there
was
no
probable
cause
in
finding.
the
commission
simply
in
a
ministerial
fashion
received
applications
for
hearings
and
set
them
without
making
any
finding
with
respect
to
the
probable
cause
of
the
determination.
for
example
in
the
case
of
mr.
dillard,
the
letter
fairly
read
from
the
doctor
sibling
indicates
that
mr.
dillard
was
predicted
to
be
able
to
go
back
to
work
in
a
couple
of
weeks
under
present
procedures
there
would
have
been
no
probable
cause
finding
in
this
respect.
and
mr.
levy
for
the
appellant
suggests
in
his
brief
that
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
the
employee
will
not
go
back
to
work
when
he
is
able
because
it’s
not
in
his
economic
self-interest
to
do
so.
i
think
the
statistics
show
that
this
is
apparently
probably
not
a
reasonable
conclusion.
first
of
all,
his
has
66
and
two-thirds
percent
is
very
close
to
--
being
tax-free
is
very
close
to
situation
for
a
person
who
is
not
earning
more
than
the
maximum
anyway
of
wage
taken
home.
further,
the
statistics
would
show
that
indeed
a
great
number
of
these
employees
do
ask
for
hearings
and
our
footnote
8
in
our
brief,
we
setup
for
the
court
of
what
was
a
representative
sample
of
a
six-month
period.
not
all
of
the
hearings
in
the
six-month
period,
but
a
representative
sample
in
which
over
91%
of
the
claims
in
which
probable
cause
had
been
found
were
affirmed
by
the
court,
excuse
me,
by
the
commission.
now,
this
would
suggest
that
there
are
great
number
of
employees
who
although
able
to
return
to
work
at
least
as
found
by
the
commission
are
willing
to
ask
for
these
hearings.
i
would
like
to
very
briefly
highlight
a
couple
of
very
important
protections
for
the
employer
under
this
case.
first
of
all
is
the
problem
of
cause
determination
as
i
have
already
mentioned.
secondly,
as
we’ve
said
in
our
brief
there
is
a
fact
that
the
employee
himself
is
able
to
choose
the
doctor
from
a
panel
pre
selected
by
the
employer
and
in
fact
the
commission
is
very
liberal
in
permitting
the
employee
to
have
another
doctor,
if
he
wishes
one
as
was
done
both
in
the
case
of
mr.
dillard
and
mr.
williams.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
it’s
all
privately
insured.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
no,
they
do
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
this
was
one
of
the
points
i
was
going
to
get
to.
they
cannot
even
enforce
their
own
decree.
section
65.1-100,
the
virginia
code
provides
enforcement
of
these
decrees
in
the
court
of
record
so
that
the
commission
cannot
require
an
employer
to
pay.
the
only
ability
it
has
in
this
respect
is
that
under
rule
13,
it
could
refuse
to
grant
a
hearing
to
an
employer
who
had
not
complied
with
the
constraint
of
that
rule,
that
is
they
had
not
paid
up
to
the
time
this
probable
cause
of
determination
is
made.
but
it
does
not
control
the
fund,
it
cannot
order
that
employer
to
pay.
it
can
only
--
if
he
refuses
to
pay
an
initial
award
for
example
they
could
assess
attorney’s
fees
when
it
got
to
hearing,
but
it
cannot
essentially
make
the
judgment
good
for
the
employee.
it
has
no
ability
to
do
this
and
this
is
the
important
factor
that
these
funds
or
private
funds,
they
are
controlled
by
the
commission
and
every
dollar
was
taken
from
the
employer
or
its
insurance
company,
and
given
to
the
employee
is
a
dollar
that
he
doesn’t
have
anymore
for
the
private
purposes.
i
would
like
to
mention
one
more
point
with
respect
to
the
protection
for
employee
and
that’s
this
question
of
notice.
i
would
note
to
the
court
that
both
parties
receive
notice.
mr.
levy
has
suggested
that
often
the
employee
only
finds
out
that
his
payment
has
been
cut
when
he
goes
to
the
mailbox
and
it
is
not
there.
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
suggest
that
anybody
finds
it
in
that
way.
all
the
evidence
that
we
have
is
that
both
of
these
employees
did
receive
notice.
one
got
the
letter
specifically
that
is
mr.
williams.
mr.
dillard,
it
is
noted
at
the
bottom
of
his
form
which
is
in
the
record
received
the
copy.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
typically
--
well,
i
should
withdraw
that
word.
based
on
my
own
reading,
it
appeared
that
there
are
substantial
number
of
cases
in
which
it
is
not.
i
don’t
know
that
what
they
said
--
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
yes,
just
as
at
court
does.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
obviously,
it
depends
to
an
extent
on
the
complexity
of
the
matter
before
the
commission.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
they
are.
for
example,
the
opinions
with
respect
to
mr.
dillard
are
in
the
record.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
appellants
on
the
basis
of
a
number
of
rather
speculative
assumptions
about
what
the
commission
is
doing
now
on
the
rule
13,
recognizing
that
we
have
no
evidence
on
the
operation
of
amended
rule
13
because
the
case
was
actually
decided
only
a
couple
months
after
it
came
into
effect.
that
on
the
basis
of
these
speculative
assumptions
for
which
there
is
no
evidence,
asking
the
court
to
conclude
that
these
laws
are
ineffective
in
virginia
and
by
presenting
their
argument
for
hearing
in
a
vacuum
they
ignore
the
substantial
effect
which
this
is
going
to
have
on
the
entire
system.
we
submit
that
the
appellants
are
asking
this
court
to
dismantle
a
carefully
structured
system,
by
balancing
--
which
balances
very
many
interests
and
very
many
factors
and
we
respectfully
request
that
this
court
decline
to
do
so.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
the
gravamen
of
my
remark
was
toward
the
effect
which
it
would
have
upon
the
operation
of
the
system.
if
your
honor
is
asking
a
question,
would
there
have
to
be
a
change
in
state
law
and
procedure,
is
that
your
question?
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
well,
i
think
it’s
difficult
to
determine
because
under
the
brief,
the
argument
seem
to
be
by
the
appellants
that
they
were
entitled
to
a
goldberg
hearing.
now,
here
today
before
this
court
they
suggest
that
they
are
all
a
myriad
of
types
of
due
process
that
might
be
available
in
any
particular
case.
we
thought
we
were
arguing
about
a
goldberg
type
hearing
and
that
is
the
way
we’ve
argued
this
case
all
along.
now,
under
that
assumption
we
think
it
would
be
a
serious
disruption
of
the
entire
system
for
the
reasons
that
we
stated
with
regard
to
increased
litigations
and
so
forth.
i
don’t
mean
to
suggest
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
wholesale
change
of
legislation
necessarily
which
would
require
this,
simply
that
the
system
will
not
function
as
it
has
and
we
think
is
a
detriment
to
court.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
depending
on
the
state
--
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
i
was
addressing
myself
to
the
procedure,
that
is
cross-examination,
presentation
of
evidence
etcetera.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
thank
you.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
will
address
myself
to
the
question
basically
of
the
due
process
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
brame,
representing
aetna
with
the
permission
of
the
court
will
address
himself
to
the
jurisdictional
points
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
property
right
here
and
whether
or
not
it
has
been
taken.
at
the
outset,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
yellow
brief
of
the
amici
of
american
insurance
association
and
the
american
mutual
insurance
alliance,
page
15
where
there
is
factual
error.
this
is
in
the
guidelines
where
they
set
out
five
guidelines,
and
the
statement
is
found
on
line
four.
“the
doctor’s
medical
report
must
indicate
that
the
employee
can
return
to
work
within
seven
days.
speculation
as
to
the
employee’s
condition
further
in
the
future
will
not
support
a
probable
cause
finding.”
apparently,
there
is
simply
a
lack
of
communication
between
the
amici
in
this
case
and
the
industrial
commission.
the
industrial
commission
takes
the
position
that
this
is
in
fact
not
true.
there
is
no
ability
for
prospective
determination.
no
doctor
can
say,
i
believe
that
this
employee
will
be
able
to
go
back
to
work
in
three
or
four
days
or
seven
or
fifteen
days
and
obtain
a
probable
cause
finding
on
that.
there
is
absolutely
no
prospective
result.
there
are
other
less
substantial
errors,
but
i
think
this
only
one
that
bears
a
comment.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
yes,
sir.
perhaps
the
seven
days
is
a
confusion
between
this
process
and
the
process
whereby
an
employee
must
be
off
work
more
than
seven
days
before
he
ever
gets
into
being
eligible
for
workmen’s
compensation
benefits.
that’s
just
speculation
of
my
part.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
your
honor
that’s
--
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
that
is
not
the
case
your
honor
with
respect
to
this
comment
with
the
--
and
also
with
respect
to
several
others
that
are
not
as
substantial,
but
this
was
apparently
based
on
communications
between
the
amici
and
the
commission
which
we
were
not
a
party
to.
i
believe
the
important
note
--
what
we
think
is
important
about
this
case
in
that
is
fairly
unique
and
it's
unique
for
this
reason.
first
of
all,
there
is
the
probable
cause
determination
under
rule
13.
the
second
thing
is
with
respect
to
the
what
amounts
to
a
tripartite
rights
and
property.
we
have
the
interest
of
course
of
the
employee,
the
interest
of
the
employer
and
we
have
the
interest
of
the
government.
i
think
to
understand
the
way
that
this
system
actually
works,
one
needs
to
look
at
what
exactly
workmen’s
compensation
is
and
if
i
may
spend
just
a
few
moments
outlining
the
way
the
system
works
in
virginia.
of
course
workmen’s
compensation
is
basically
a
substitute
for
common
law
tort
and
under
this
procedure,
the
basic
changes
regarding
the
fact
the
employee
no
longer
has
a
certain
tort
and
therefore
would
not
get
as
much
money
perhaps
in
particular
cases
on
the
workmen’s
compensation
he
would
get
under
common
law.
on
the
other
hand,
the
employer
gives
up
certain
defenses
such
as
the
doctrine
of
fellow
servant,
of
contributory
negligence,
and
so
forth
and
therefore
there
is
at
least
compensation
on
every
case
in
industrial
accident.
the
system
provides
basically
for
two
types
of
payment:
one
a
medical;
the
second
is
temporary
compensation.
now,
they
may
in
fact
be
permanent
incapacity.
the
provision
on
the
law,
there
will
be
a
rating
of
a
percentage
of
capacity
and
there
will
be
payments
on
the
basis
of
that,
but
up
until
a
doctor
is
able
to
rate
an
employee,
there
will
be
temporary
compensation.
the
statute
provides
for
payment
during
incapacity.
the
award
in
the
case
of
mr.
williams
and
mr.
dillard
provides
for
payment
during
incapacity.
so
then
as
to
be
anticipated
that
this
payment
will
not
go
on
forever
and
that
in
fact
there
are
generally
three
ways
in
which
it
will
end,
one
is
of
course
that
the
employee
recovers
and
is
able
to
go
back
to
work.
secondly,
it
is
clear
that
he
has
progressed
to
whatever
point
he
is
going
to
with
respect
to
his
incapacity
and
is
rated.
or
third,
he
may
have
been
partially
incapacitated
for
the
entire
statutory
period
of
500
weeks
and
essentially
his
famous
will
run
out
under
that
system.
now,
with
respect
to
a
question
that
justice
blackmun
raised,
this
gets
me
really
to
my
next
point.
this
is
what
we
think
is
the
touchstone
of
the
system
of
virginia
and
what
makes
it
work
as
well
as
it
does
and
that
is
voluntariness.
as
counsel
for
the
appellants
have
already
suggested
roughly
95%
of
the
cases
are
decided
without
any
opinion
or
handled
by
the
employer,
the
employee
and
the
insurance
companies
act
in
good
faith.
now,
mr.
levy
has
suggested
in
his
reply
brief
and
also
he
suggested
in
response
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question
that
he
would
not
impute
any
bad
faith.
we
submit
that’s
not
the
problem.
the
problem
is
that
at
the
present
time
it
is
in
the
insurance
company’s
self-interest
and
in
the
employers’
self-interest
to
very
properly
undertake
payment
to
an
employee
and
in
workmen’s
comp
situation.
this
is
done
because
it
is
a
moral
factor
for
the
employee.
the
employer
likes
to
get
the
employee
getting
favor
soon
and
in
fact
the
commission
knows
that
often
payment
is
made
to
the
employee
prior
to
there
even
being
an
award.
now,
this
is
also
based
on
the
fact
that
if
the
employer
finds
out
that
there’s
been
some
sort
of
mistake,
the
representation
of
the
employer
turns
out
to
be
something
different
from
what
has
been
represented,
it
is
readily
easy
to
terminate
this.
of
course
under
the
present
system
where
there
has
been
change
of
condition,
he
can
terminate
it
and
set
it
for
hearing.
we
submit
that
the
problem
will
be
not
simply
as
you
have
in
goldberg,
you
will
have
a
hearing
every
time
somebody
wants
one,
that’s
not
all
you’ll
have.
you'll
have
all
of
the
extra
hearings
from
the
people
who
want
them
and
then
on
top
of
that
you
will
have
all
the
hearings
with
a
cause
on
the
front
end,
not
because
of
any
bad
faith,
but
simply
because
it
has
become
in
the
insurance
companies
and
employers'
economic
self
interest
to
look
much
harder
at
the
claim
before
they
ever
take
it
to
be
sure
that
this
is
a
compensable
claim.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
the
system
in
virginia
is
that
it's
value
rated
by
industry.
for
example,
all
employers
of
bricklayers
would
pay
a
sum
of
a
premium
as
all
other
employers
of
bricklayers,
but
they
might
not
pay
the
same
premium
as
metalworkers.
so
that
an
individual
company's
experience
will
not
affect
its
insurance
premium,
but
the
industry
experience
will.
now,
to
that
extent,
i
think
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
you
raise
a
good
point
to
separate
the
insurance
company
from
the
self-employer
or
self-insured
employer.
the
self
insured
employer
of
course
across
the
street
from
each
to
competitors,
one
having
a
claim
and
they
although
not
may
be
in
a
competitive
situation
such
that
he
can’t
absorb.
it
maybe
a
small
business,
just
simply
cannot
absorb
it.
this,
of
course,
wouldn’t
happen
were
they
were
insurance
companies
because
the
competitive
angle
is
then
gone.
that
is
every
other
bricklayer
has
got
to
pay
the
same
premium
if
they
are
inflated
as
this
bricklayer
does.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
he
would
not,
but
his
carrier
of
course
would
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
it
and
the
employer
has
the
interest
to
the
extent
that
he
would
not
want
his
premium
to
go
up
which
it
necessarily
would
as
a
result
of
this
system.
it
would
be
quite
easy
for
any
employee
of
simply
to
say
no
when
asked
of
his
change
of
condition
had
occurred
and
ask
for
the
hearing.
i
might
further
respond
as
far
as
the
time
limit
is
concerned,
i
don’t
think
in
fact
that
the
interrogatories
reflect
with
the
time
limit
is.
i
think
it
is
interrogatory
number
14
is
the
answer
to
the
question
about
what
is
the
time
limit
for
change
of
condition
hearings
and
that
is
what
is
the
delay
between
their
request
for
the
hearing
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
and
the
answer
of
this
is
to
refer
it
back
to
answer
six
and
answer
six
refers
the
interrogatory
to
the
fact
that
these
records
are
simply
not
available
in
that
form
and
they
could
come
to
the
office.
so
what
we
end
up
with
is
simply
no
statistics
in
the
record
to
show
what
the
delay
is.
the
commission
was
unable
to
obtain
them
without
going
through
all
of
its
files.
there
are
some
other
statistics
with
respect
to
the
one
month
and
the
one
to
three
months
and
i
might
say
based
on
my
own
knowledge
having
been
advised
by
my
client
that
these
are
probably
in
the
ballpark
for
these
types
of
hearings
as
well,
but
they
are
not,
there
has
been
no
statistics
in
the
record
as
such.
the
important
thing,
we
think
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
voluntariness
with
respect
to
the
increased
litigation
which
the
commission
expects
to
occur
is
the
fact
that
this
is
not
in
the
employee’s
best
interest.
the
commission
in
a
sense
is
biased
towards
the
employee,
that
is
really
has
raised
on
deterrence.
that’s
what
is
there
for
the
rules
and
the
statute
make
it
very
clear
it’s
very
liberal
for
the
employee,
heresy
evidence
can
be
presented
by
the
employee,
all
sorts
of
loosening
of
normal
judicial
constraints
of
their
--
and
the
commission
believes
it
will
not
be
in
employee’s
best
interest
in
the
sense
that
the
employee
for
example
often
will
have
returned
to
work
by
the
time
he
will
have
ever
got
his
hearing
if
the
insurance
company
denies
that
they
have
a
claim.
often,
these
actions
don’t
incapacitate
the
employee
for
more
than
several
weeks
or
several
months
and
he
is
likely
to
be
back
at
work.
if
he
of
course
has
been
living
on
his
income
and
he
has
no
savings
he
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
to
that.
the
very
argument
which
the
appellants
made
for
having
the
benefits
continue
comes
back
on
the
front
end
to
show
that
it’s
a
very
good
reason
for
not
having
it
work
that
way.
now,
as
far
as
the
--
again,
the
employer
or
insurance
company’s
ability
to
abuse
this
process,
one
can’t
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
probable
cause
to
termination
by
a
disinterested,
perhaps
even
biased
towards
the
employee
party.
and
another
important
thing
to
note
is
with
respect
to
this
case
is
that
all
of
the
actions
which
took
place
with
respect
to
these
two
appellants
took
place
prior
to
amended
rule
13.
that
is
under
old
rule
13,
there
was
no
probable
cause
in
finding.
the
commission
simply
in
a
ministerial
fashion
received
applications
for
hearings
and
set
them
without
making
any
finding
with
respect
to
the
probable
cause
of
the
determination.
for
example
in
the
case
of
mr.
dillard,
the
letter
fairly
read
from
the
doctor
sibling
indicates
that
mr.
dillard
was
predicted
to
be
able
to
go
back
to
work
in
a
couple
of
weeks
under
present
procedures
there
would
have
been
no
probable
cause
finding
in
this
respect.
and
mr.
levy
for
the
appellant
suggests
in
his
brief
that
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
the
employee
will
not
go
back
to
work
when
he
is
able
because
it’s
not
in
his
economic
self-interest
to
do
so.
i
think
the
statistics
show
that
this
is
apparently
probably
not
a
reasonable
conclusion.
first
of
all,
his
has
66
and
two-thirds
percent
is
very
close
to
--
being
tax-free
is
very
close
to
situation
for
a
person
who
is
not
earning
more
than
the
maximum
anyway
of
wage
taken
home.
further,
the
statistics
would
show
that
indeed
a
great
number
of
these
employees
do
ask
for
hearings
and
our
footnote
8
in
our
brief,
we
setup
for
the
court
of
what
was
a
representative
sample
of
a
six-month
period.
not
all
of
the
hearings
in
the
six-month
period,
but
a
representative
sample
in
which
over
91%
of
the
claims
in
which
probable
cause
had
been
found
were
affirmed
by
the
court,
excuse
me,
by
the
commission.
now,
this
would
suggest
that
there
are
great
number
of
employees
who
although
able
to
return
to
work
at
least
as
found
by
the
commission
are
willing
to
ask
for
these
hearings.
i
would
like
to
very
briefly
highlight
a
couple
of
very
important
protections
for
the
employer
under
this
case.
first
of
all
is
the
problem
of
cause
determination
as
i
have
already
mentioned.
secondly,
as
we’ve
said
in
our
brief
there
is
a
fact
that
the
employee
himself
is
able
to
choose
the
doctor
from
a
panel
pre
selected
by
the
employer
and
in
fact
the
commission
is
very
liberal
in
permitting
the
employee
to
have
another
doctor,
if
he
wishes
one
as
was
done
both
in
the
case
of
mr.
dillard
and
mr.
williams.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
it’s
all
privately
insured.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
no,
they
do
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
this
was
one
of
the
points
i
was
going
to
get
to.
they
cannot
even
enforce
their
own
decree.
section
65.1-100,
the
virginia
code
provides
enforcement
of
these
decrees
in
the
court
of
record
so
that
the
commission
cannot
require
an
employer
to
pay.
the
only
ability
it
has
in
this
respect
is
that
under
rule
13,
it
could
refuse
to
grant
a
hearing
to
an
employer
who
had
not
complied
with
the
constraint
of
that
rule,
that
is
they
had
not
paid
up
to
the
time
this
probable
cause
of
determination
is
made.
but
it
does
not
control
the
fund,
it
cannot
order
that
employer
to
pay.
it
can
only
--
if
he
refuses
to
pay
an
initial
award
for
example
they
could
assess
attorney’s
fees
when
it
got
to
hearing,
but
it
cannot
essentially
make
the
judgment
good
for
the
employee.
it
has
no
ability
to
do
this
and
this
is
the
important
factor
that
these
funds
or
private
funds,
they
are
controlled
by
the
commission
and
every
dollar
was
taken
from
the
employer
or
its
insurance
company,
and
given
to
the
employee
is
a
dollar
that
he
doesn’t
have
anymore
for
the
private
purposes.
i
would
like
to
mention
one
more
point
with
respect
to
the
protection
for
employee
and
that’s
this
question
of
notice.
i
would
note
to
the
court
that
both
parties
receive
notice.
mr.
levy
has
suggested
that
often
the
employee
only
finds
out
that
his
payment
has
been
cut
when
he
goes
to
the
mailbox
and
it
is
not
there.
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
suggest
that
anybody
finds
it
in
that
way.
all
the
evidence
that
we
have
is
that
both
of
these
employees
did
receive
notice.
one
got
the
letter
specifically
that
is
mr.
williams.
mr.
dillard,
it
is
noted
at
the
bottom
of
his
form
which
is
in
the
record
received
the
copy.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
typically
--
well,
i
should
withdraw
that
word.
based
on
my
own
reading,
it
appeared
that
there
are
substantial
number
of
cases
in
which
it
is
not.
i
don’t
know
that
what
they
said
--
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
yes,
just
as
at
court
does.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
obviously,
it
depends
to
an
extent
on
the
complexity
of
the
matter
before
the
commission.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
they
are.
for
example,
the
opinions
with
respect
to
mr.
dillard
are
in
the
record.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
the
appellants
on
the
basis
of
a
number
of
rather
speculative
assumptions
about
what
the
commission
is
doing
now
on
the
rule
13,
recognizing
that
we
have
no
evidence
on
the
operation
of
amended
rule
13
because
the
case
was
actually
decided
only
a
couple
months
after
it
came
into
effect.
that
on
the
basis
of
these
speculative
assumptions
for
which
there
is
no
evidence,
asking
the
court
to
conclude
that
these
laws
are
ineffective
in
virginia
and
by
presenting
their
argument
for
hearing
in
a
vacuum
they
ignore
the
substantial
effect
which
this
is
going
to
have
on
the
entire
system.
we
submit
that
the
appellants
are
asking
this
court
to
dismantle
a
carefully
structured
system,
by
balancing
--
which
balances
very
many
interests
and
very
many
factors
and
we
respectfully
request
that
this
court
decline
to
do
so.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
the
gravamen
of
my
remark
was
toward
the
effect
which
it
would
have
upon
the
operation
of
the
system.
if
your
honor
is
asking
a
question,
would
there
have
to
be
a
change
in
state
law
and
procedure,
is
that
your
question?
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
well,
i
think
it’s
difficult
to
determine
because
under
the
brief,
the
argument
seem
to
be
by
the
appellants
that
they
were
entitled
to
a
goldberg
hearing.
now,
here
today
before
this
court
they
suggest
that
they
are
all
a
myriad
of
types
of
due
process
that
might
be
available
in
any
particular
case.
we
thought
we
were
arguing
about
a
goldberg
type
hearing
and
that
is
the
way
we’ve
argued
this
case
all
along.
now,
under
that
assumption
we
think
it
would
be
a
serious
disruption
of
the
entire
system
for
the
reasons
that
we
stated
with
regard
to
increased
litigations
and
so
forth.
i
don’t
mean
to
suggest
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
wholesale
change
of
legislation
necessarily
which
would
require
this,
simply
that
the
system
will
not
function
as
it
has
and
we
think
is
a
detriment
to
court.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
depending
on
the
state
--
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
i
was
addressing
myself
to
the
procedure,
that
is
cross-examination,
presentation
of
evidence
etcetera.
mr.
stuart
h.
dunn
thank
you.
