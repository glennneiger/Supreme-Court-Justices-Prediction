justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
written
participation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
only
if
he
didn’t
ask
for
more?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
he
have
the
right
--
would
he
have
the
right
always
to
evidentiary
hearing
to
cross-exam
previous
witnesses?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
even
if
you
lose
there,
there’s
still
a
live
of
controversy
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
arguing
that
even
if
that
were
later
determined
that
he
was
validly
terminated,
aren’t
you
claiming
that
this
initial
termination
wasn’t
proper
because
of
inadequate
procedures
that
you
are
entitled
to
payment
until
proper
procedures
were
provided?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you’re
right
on
that
this
isn’t
moot,
then
he
have
some
back
--
he
had
some
so-called
back
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
really
is
a
question
about
mootness,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
burney.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
am
not
sure
about
that.
at
the
hearing
your
claim
would
be
sustained
or
not.
if
it’s
sustained
he’s
going
to
get
retroactive
benefits.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
entire
period.
if
it’s
terminated,
if
his
claim
is
rejected
then
it
isn’t
going
to
disappear
if
somebody
has
preserved
the
claim
against
the
insurance
company
that
meanwhile,
that
meanwhile
pending
a
due
process
hearing
he
is
entitled
to
payments
because
they
weren’t
terminated
with
due
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
the
issue
doesn't
just
washout.
anybody
in
some
subsequent
case
who
claims
against
the
insurance
company
for
interim
benefits,
where
they
have
been
terminated
without
due
process
as
you
claim
could
preserve
his
claim.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no.
it
wouldn’t
be
moot
because
he
wouldn’t
--
if
he,
if
this
present
procedure
complied
to
due
process,
he
could
not
get
his
interim
payments.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
each
employee
in
virginia
enter
into
some
kind
of
agreement
when
he
goes
to
work
covering
his
workmen’s
compensation?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
the
worker’s
contract
is
with
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
is
the
one
who
has
the
obligations
imposed
by
the
workmen’s
compensation
system?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it’s
really
the
employers
that
owes
--
it’s
the
employer
who
really
owes
the
payments?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
even
if
the
employer
gets
an
insurance
carrier
to
carry
his
loan
form,
it
is
the
--
the
worker
who
hasn't
any
relationship
with
the
insurance
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
his
contract
is
with
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
my
real
question
is
whether
this
employee
if
he
was
denied
procedural
due
process
in
connection
with
termination
of
his
benefits
has
a
claim
against
the
employer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
didn’t
need
to
enjoin
travelers
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say,
he
is
entitled
for
court
pending
the
appeal
under
the
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
to
prevail
he
would
have
to
show
there
was
a
probable
cause
to
termination?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
show
the
award
if
they
pay
me?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
hasn’t
it
been
modified
by
termination
based
of
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
after
the
due
process
hearing,
after
the
court
hearing
and
the
award
is
terminated,
i
would
suppose
the
employee
if
he
hasn’t
been
paid
meanwhile
could
still
go
back
and
sue
for
the
interim
period?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
wasn’t
terminated
during
that
period?
justice
byron
r.
white
one
of
the
facts
is
you
never
been
--
the
employer
has
never
been
paying,
the
employer
doesn’t
pay
anymore,
that’s
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
doesn’t
pay
at
all
although
he
is
legally
obligated
to,
you’re
telling
me.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
commission
hasn’t
told
them
not
to
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
said
there’s
probable
cause
to
terminate.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
is
terminated.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
is
put
to
act
and
nevertheless
he
is
legally
obligated
to
be
paid.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
awarding
what
the
court
would
say
is
the
award
have
never
got
effected.
justice
byron
r.
white
mainly,
that
you
got
ordered
before
let
say
if
you
put
up
the
warrant.
now,
why
we
have
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
before
you
go
to
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
pending
the
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
wins
in
the
court.
the
court
says,
“pay
according
to
the
award
it’s
never
been
terminated.”
justice
byron
r.
white
i
assume
there
was
a
legal
obligation
to
pay
whether
the
court
sets
the
order
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
while
the
employer
is
just
ignoring
his
legal
duties,
what
do
you
suggest?
justice
byron
r.
white
pending
a
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
have
to
get
into
court
before
the
hearing
and
if
the
court
wasn't
very
busy
and
heard
your
case
right
away.
do
you
agree
that
the
employer
would
be
ordered
to
pay
pending
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
actually
have
this
--
there
would
be
an
order
to
pay
or
the
employer
would
just
say
“i
am
awfully
sorry,
i
know
you’ve
got
a
judgment,
but
i
won’t
pay
you?”
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
we
--
the
commission
have
probable
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
that's
meaningless.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but
if
the
employer
relies
on
(inaudible)
but
apparently
it
doesn’t
affect
the
guy
were
involved.
justice
byron

now
you
brought
it
up.
