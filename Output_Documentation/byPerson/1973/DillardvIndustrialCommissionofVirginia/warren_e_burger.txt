mr.

you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
dunn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
you
speak
of
a
goldberg
type
of
hearing,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
hearing
officer
who
could
consider
the
matter
in
the
goldberg
case
would
be
more
objective,
more
neutral
than
the
commission
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
do
you
--
were
you
addressing
yourself
to
the
content
of
the
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see.
very
well
mr.
dunn.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
brame.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
has
there
ever
been
any
attack
on
that
virginia
statute
on
the
grounds
that
it’s
a
denial
of
due
process,
the
irrebuttable
presumption
in
effect
about
the
recoupment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
doesn't
meet
the
time
problem
that
was
involved
for
example
in
goldberg,
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
simply
pick
another
one.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
letter
that
you
have
referred
to
at
page
75
calls
for
the
employee
if
he
agrees
to
indicate
agreement
and
i
suppose
in
a
great
many
of
the
cases,
if
not
on
majority
the
employee
does
agree
and
he
indicates
that
in
response
to
this
notice,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
in
any
event
if
after
receiving
this
notice
and
he
has
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
it
if
he
wishes
to,
but
if
he
goes
back
to
work
on
the
following
monday
then
there’s
no
problem
i
take
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
the
letter
states
that
it
does
not
terminate
the
award,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
it
does?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
precise
the
probable
cause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
levy,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
before
you
go
to
the
response,
aren’t
you
really
asking
some
kind
of
a
judicial
command
from
someone,
some
court
somewhere
to
keep
up
the
payments
until
there
has
been
a
full
adversary
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
other
words
sort
of
a
specific
performance,
equity
relief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
what
you
are
doing
is
conceding
that
you
have
an
adequate
remedy
at
law,
but
it
is
too
complicated
and
takes
to
long.
therefore,
you
want
something,
you
want
a
shortcut?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
was
not
a
contractual
case,
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
welfare.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.

you
gentlemen.
the

is
submitted.
