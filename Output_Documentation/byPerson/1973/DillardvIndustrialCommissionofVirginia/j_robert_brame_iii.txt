mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
argument
before
this
court
already
indicates
the
reason
that
we
ask
the
court
to
grant
us
the
right
to
argue
to
split
the
appellee’s
argument.
you
heard
about
the
interest
of
the
employee
and
you’ve
heard
about
the
interest
to
the
state,
but
our
position
here
is
the
interest
that
has
been
forgotten
is
the
interest
of
the
employer.
this
court
has
long
held
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
a
shield
which
protects
the
liberties
and
properties
of
our
citizens.
what
the
appellant’s
today
ask
is
that
the
shield
be
converted
into
a
sword
and
this
sword,
they
use
to
deprive
the
employers
of
their
property
without
due
process
of
law.
appellants
ask
this
court
to
weigh
the
private
competing
interest
of
the
employer
on
one
hand
and
the
employee
on
the
other
and
upon
finding
that
the
employees
need
is
greater
to
order
that
the
employer
yield
up
his
funds
to
an
employee
for
whom
you
had
an
independent
finding
or
probable
cause
that
the
employee
is
not
entitled
to
these
funds.
and
after
the
employer
has
established
his
defense
the
--
plus
the
fact
that
under
virginia
law
all
the
funds
that
are
paid
to
an
employee,
whether
under
mistake
or
whatever
by
an
employer
under
the
workmen’s
compensation
system
can
never
be
recouped.
there
is
no
right
of
employer
to
recoup
any
funds,
but
yet
if
the
employee’s
suspension
is
later
found
to
be
erroneous
then
the
employee
is
immediately
paid
up
to
date.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
they
could
permit
recoup,
but
i
think
probably
the
answer
and
this
gets
again
to
the
state's
arguments
that
delicate
balance
here
that
state
has
struck.
and
they
have
weighed
it
against
the
employers
because
i
think
they
have
found
it
was
not
--
the
state
found
it
was
not
in
the
state’s
interest
to
have
the
employer
pursuing
persons
who
just
come
off
of
workmen’s
compensation.
this
is
i
think
an
indication
of
the
state's
concern
for
the
well-being
of
the
employees.
it’s
something
we
employers
have
to
live
with,
but
today
it
hasn’t
become
access,
if
it
does
we
may
be
in
this
court
on
the
other
side
of
the
case.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
not
--
no,
your
honor.
not
that
the
annotation
show.
it's
not
a
presumption,
it
just
says
well
and
it
may
be
helpful
to
explain
this
because
i
don’t
think
that
the
court
--
it
hadn’t
been
explained
the
court
exactly
how
this
system
operates.
in
virginia,
if
there’s
an
accident,
it
appears
to
be
a
compensable
accident
and
the
disability
has
to
run
more
than
seven
days
or
there
has
to
be
medical
expenditures,
the
employer
and
employee
in
95%
of
the
cases
enter
into
a
stipulation
and
it
is
entered
--
then
entered
by
the
commission
as
an
order.
the
order
speaks
that
the
employer
shall
pay
specified
benefits
during
incapacity.
by
statue,
this
order
continues
until
it
is
amended
or
altered
by
the
commission
after
a
full
due
process
hearing.
any
amounts
paid
there
under
are
not
recouped
by
the
employer.
what
the
rule
13
that
that
you’ve
heard
about
is
a
procedural
addition
or
enhancement
of
employee’s
rights.
as
it
was
stated
earlier,
these
commission
awards
are
not
enforceable
by
the
commission
and
must
be
enforced
in
the
court
of
record.
so,
if
the
employer
or
the
insurance
carrier
didn’t
pay
it
have
to
go
in
the
court
and
sue.
the
industrial
commission,
in
the
30’s
created
rule
13
which
says
in
effect
the
only
way
that
employer
can
check
and
alter
this
award
is
to
come
to
us
for
a
hearing.
but
we’re
not
going
to
receive
an
application
for
a
hearing
until
you
pay
that
employee
up
until
the
date
of
the
application.
and
the
subsequent
amendments
have
said
we
are
not
going
to
give
you
a
hearing
until
you
have
given
us
evidence
which
shows
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there’s
been
a
change
in
condition.
what
they
have
done
--
what
the
commission
has
done
is
to
limit
the
employer’s
right
to
this
due
process
hearing.
and
a
by-product
of
this
has
been
to
give
the
employee
some
additional
claims
to
funds
without
having
to
go
to
a
court.
and
what
they
are
claiming
is
their
property
right
is
this
future
extension
which
they
have
never
had.
and
the
roth
case,
i
think
recognizes
that
it’s
a
sort
of
a
unilateral
wish,
but
it’s
nothing
that’s
found
in
the
state
statute
that
you
can
really
complain
as
property
rights.
a
couple
of
corrections
on
the
error
on
the
record.
coverage
does
not
extend
to
all
employers
and
all
employees
in
state.
that
statute
applied
is
mandatory
for
employers
of
three
or
more
employees.
employers
of
smaller
in
numbers
can
come
under
the
act
but
they
do
so
voluntarily.
coverage,
thus,
is
not
mandatory
and
further
more,
the
contract
does
issue
to
the
employee.
it
doesn’t
get
a
written
copy,
but
the
virginia
code
section
65.1-111
says
in
effect
that
the
employee
shall
be
allowed
to
bring
an
action
his
own
name
against
the
insurance
company
on
the
contract.
the
real
question
here
i
think
is
the
property
that
the
employer
is
going
to
lose.
you’ve
got
a
system
where
the
employer,
his
natural
interest
is
to
suspend
payment.
now,
the
fact
that
he
suspends
payment
after
this
initial
hearing
doesn’t
mean
that
the
employee
cannot
go
into
the
court
and
enforce
it
because
he
can.
he
can
always
go
into
court
and
enforce
it
even
after
commission
has
found
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
is
a
changing
condition.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
well,
your
honor
if
you
read
goldberg
together
with
roth,
i
think
it
does.
the
right
that
they
have
got
--
the
enforceable
right
is
in
this
award
and
this
award
must
be
enforced
in
the
court
of
record.
and
even
after
the
employer
has
gotten
a
hearing
until
that
order
issues
out
of
the
commission
at
some
later
date,
that
award
continues
to
be
enforced.
and
he
gets
--
it
can
be
sued
on
and
get
judgment,
almost
a
confession
of
judgment
even
up
until
the
day
the
commission
rescinds
that
order
or
amends
that
order.
so,
he
still
has
the
enforceable
right
in
court.
what
he
is
asking
for
is
some
sort
of
decision
by
the
commission
to
call
up
the
employer
and
say,
“well,
we
got
a
favorable
decision
for
this
man
is
not
entitled
the
money
but
we
are
not
going
to
release
this
decision
until
you
pay
him
up
to
date.”
and
that's
the
time
situation
--
you
get
to
the
problem.
there
are
two
competing
claims
of
the
contract
in
nature
between
the
employer
and
the
employee.
every
dollar
the
employer
pays
comes
out
of
his
pocket
or
his
insurance
company’s
pocket
and
they’ll
get
it
back
from
it,
but
what
--
the
money
he
pays
that’s
unjustified
he
can
never
recover
from
the
claimant.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
well,
that
would
be
a
problem
of
disability,
your
honor
and
there
is
no
probation
for
any
payment
for
cessation
of
payment.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
oh!
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
right.
it's
the
same
type
of
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
in
case,
well,
he
is
notified
but
even
assuming
that’s
true
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
it
depends
on
the
circumstances,
your
honor.
but
i
am
assuming
that
he
is
not.
i
mean,
i
am
willing
to
assume
for
the
purposes
of
my
argument
that
he
is
not,
that
the
employer
doesn't
tell
the
employee,
but
our
argument
is
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
under
1983
because
our
suspension
is
pursuant
to
the
right
of
a
person
in
free
society
to
do
that
which
is
not
by
law
prohibited.
the
law
does
not
prohibit
us
from
suspending
under
certain
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
right.
the
case
is
here
to
determine
whether
or
not
state
in
action
is
--
state
action
under
1983
and
as
we
read
1983,
it
requires
either
a
positive
state
law
requiring
someone
to
terminate
or
such
a
degree
of
intertwining
between
the
employers
in
the
state
so
that
the
employers
actions
are
the
state's
actions.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
it
will
--
the
commission’s
determination
of
probable
cause
is
completely
irrelevant.
it
has
no
relationship
to
the
award.
the
award
is
still
outstanding.
the
award
has
not
been
modified.
hence,
it
is
enforceable
of
right
under
section
100
or
101.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
yes.
and
the
employer
as
far
as
we
can
feel,
has
no
real
defense.
it’s
a
system
that
has
not
been
abused
and
so
it
hasn't
been
protectively
attacked
but
that’s
our
point.
that
he
always
has
that
right
even
after
the
determination
of
probable
cause
to
go
into
court
and
to
enforce
a
judgment
on
the
award
itself.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
well,
they
go
to
the
state
agency,
your
honor,
the
95%
figure
i
believe
is
a
question
of
initial
entitlement.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
any
agreement
between
the
employer
and
the
employee
respecting
compensation
payments
after
an
injury
must
be
approved
by
the
industrial
commission.
the
employer
and
employee
if
they
agree
to
entitlement,
it’s
really
just
a
question
was
there
compensable
acts
beyond
seven
days,
sign
a
form
which
i
believe
is
in
the
record
entitled
a
memorandum
of
agreement.
that
memorandum
of
agreement
is
submitted
to
the
industrial
commission
which
if
they
review
it
and
find
it
to
be
in
satisfactory
order
and
properly
protecting
the
interest
of
the
employees
will
enforce
it.
then
it
will
issue
as
an
order
of
the
commission
requiring
compensation
payments
to
be
made
during
incapacity.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
i
am
not
sure
if
the
figure
is
that
high.
it’s
very
high.
it’s
very,
very
much
an
informal
system
in
the
sense
that
you
don’t
have
a
lot
of
play
by
counsel.
it
works
pretty
much
with
voluntary
system
overseen
by
the
industrial
commission
which
significantly
favors
the
employee.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
yes.
if
it’s
not.
there
had
been
some
cases
where
the
agreement
was
not
approved
by
the
commission.
the
commission,
unless
they
approve
it
and
enter
an
order
affecting
the
initial
award,
the
initial
award
remains
outstanding.
as
in
the
manchester
case
which
i
think
everybody
has
cited
to
the
court
the
award
remained
outstanding
for
perhaps
a
year-and-a-half
after
the
employee
went
back
to
work.
the
question
was
is
an
enforcement
of
these
circumstances
because
of
harsh
results
to
the
employer
and
the
court
held
that
you
can
only
get
to
the
commission
through
rule
99.
the
employer
had
not
done
it
to
specify
date
in
that
year-and-half's
award.
although
perhaps
he
wasn’t
entitled
it,
it
was
enforceable
in
the
court
of
record.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
right
your
honor.
and
that
order
is
effected
only
by
a
hearing
which
i
believe
everybody
admits
is
a
due
process
hearing.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
notice
was
given
to
mr.
dillard,
your
honor.
one
of
the
papers
filed
in
the
record
shows
a
carbon
copy
to
mr.
dillard,
that
was
not
under
rule
13.
the
rule
13
as
it
now
stands
has
been
changed.
that
was
sort
of
old
rule
13
thing.
he
did
get
notice
on
it
nevertheless
and
then
mr.
williams,
the
exhibit
mr.
williams’
case
which
is
exhibit
“a”
on
page
75
of
the
record
also
shows
that
he
gets
a
notice.
it’s
not
in
the
record
but
the
industrial
commission
has
a
practice
that
if
they
receive
an
application
for
a
hearing
on
change
of
condition
and
there
is
no
indication
that
the
employee
has
been
notified,
they
have
a
form
on
which
they
immediately
notify
the
employee.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
i
am
not
sure
that
--
how
--
if
i
can
answer
that
completely.
if
the
employee
calls
up
and
submits
a
medical
report
i
think
they
would
consider
it.
they
want
him
to
know
as
soon
as
possible
and
i
think
probably
as
a
practical
matter
if
it
turns
out
to
be
a
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
employers
what
i
understand
in
the
industrial
commission’s
working,
that
application
is
going
to
be
withdrawn
right
quickly
and
things
will
be
restored
in
status
quo.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
your
honor,
there
is
a
fair
degree
of
response.
i
can’t
characterize
it
as
a
high
degree
or
low
degree.
i
think
the
answer
is
that
only,
maybe
10%
of
these
go
to
a
hearing
and
eventually
go
to
a
hearing
where
both
parties
appear.
hearing
is
automatically
scheduled.
the
employer
has
the
obligation
in
scheduling
the
hearing
as
this
shows
the
obligation
of
coming
forward.
the
number
of
these
that
go
to
hearing
are
not
substantial,
so
one
way
or
another
there
is
an
agreement
reached.
sometimes
it’s
difficult
for
practical
matter
to
get
people
in
that
wage
bracket
to
sign
an
agreement
to
anything.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
there
--
well,
there
is
no
problem
under
the
situation
as
it
now
exists
although
that
award
continues
and
he
can
go
into
court
presumably
and
enforce
it
even
then
up
until
the
hearing.
now,
after
the
hearing
and
the
order
issues
confirming
that
he
is
back
at
work
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
right.
i
am
not
sure
the
letter
does.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
it
does.
well,
the
court
is
ready
to
look
close
and
i
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
no.
as
to
what
your
honor?
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
as
to
what?
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
right.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
no.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
yes.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
yes.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
no,
it
has
no
relationship
your
honor.
the
probable
cause
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
it’s
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
which
is
a
green
brief
that’s
virginia
code
section
65.1-100
and
all
he
has
to
do
is
show
the
court
that
he’s
got
an
award
by
the
commission
that’s
outstanding
and
it
has
not
been
modified
and
the
amounts
that
have
been
paid
and
he
gets
an
order
immediately.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
the
termination
based
on
probable
cause
does
not
--
has
no
relationship
to
the
award.
if
the
award
continues
until
the
due
process
hearing,
what
the
commission
says
in
that
rule,
we
will
not
let
the
employer
even
file
an
application
for
a
hearing.
we
won’t
give
the
employer
a
standing
to
even
argue
a
change
in
condition
until
he
has
paid
the
employee
up
to
date
and
shown
probable
cause.
it's
a
device
of
controlling
as
much
as
anything
controlling
the
number
of
cases
which
they
receive.
it
is
like
the
old
common
law
of
court
requiring
it
to
be
on
oath.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
yes.
i
can
construe
this
section
no
other
way.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
right.
that’s
the
holding
in
the
manchester.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
no,
the

mr.

robert
brame,
iii
it
wasn’t
terminated
during
that
period
but
the
commission’s
order
in
most
cases
dates
back
to
the
date
the
application
was
received.
now,
if
it’s
been
enforced
meantime
then
the
employers
--
[laughter
attempt]
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
not
to
the
date
of
hearing,
to
the
date
of
the
application.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
right.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
in
answer
to
the
question
on
the
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
your
honor
we
ask
the
same
question.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
right.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
the
way
we
read
this
section.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
no,
that’s
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
right.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
right.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
right.
as
this
section
the
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
at
what
point
in
time
now?
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
right.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
right.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
right.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
well,
in
the
sense
there
is
--
in
the
sense
there’s
a
contractual.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
i
almost
have
just
after
--
well,
it’s
a
contractual
duty
now
whether
the
moral
onus
is
something
else,
but
they
do
have
a
continuing
award
requiring
them
to
pay
and
they
don’t
pay.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
the
one,
the
decision
on
this
--
the
best
i
can
find
from
quickly
looking
at
the
annotations,
one
called
parrigen
v.
long,
134
southeast
562
which
says
that
under
section
100
which
is
the
enforcement
section
that
the
court’s
duty
is
strictly
ministerial.
it
can
inquire
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
it
can
inquire
into
the
whether
or
not
the
employee
was
actually
entitled.
it
goes
back
to
what
we
said
before.
we
have
got
a
system
that
has
worked
on
a
voluntary
basis.
the
employees,
the
hearing
is
on
a
fairly
short
basis
and
there
have
not
been
a
large
number
of
suits
of
this
type.
but
i
think
the
answer
is
most
the
determination
particular
under
the
new
rule
13
are
justified.
employees
are
back
at
work.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that
was
the
manchester
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief;
it
was
cited
in
everybody’s
brief.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
manchester
board
and
paper
company.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
argument
before
this
court
already
indicates
the
reason
that
we
ask
the
court
to
grant
us
the
right
to
argue
to
split
the
appellee’s
argument.
you
heard
about
the
interest
of
the
employee
and
you’ve
heard
about
the
interest
to
the
state,
but
our
position
here
is
the
interest
that
has
been
forgotten
is
the
interest
of
the
employer.
this
court
has
long
held
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
as
a
shield
which
protects
the
liberties
and
properties
of
our
citizens.
what
the
appellant’s
today
ask
is
that
the
shield
be
converted
into
a
sword
and
this
sword,
they
use
to
deprive
the
employers
of
their
property
without
due
process
of
law.
appellants
ask
this
court
to
weigh
the
private
competing
interest
of
the
employer
on
one
hand
and
the
employee
on
the
other
and
upon
finding
that
the
employees
need
is
greater
to
order
that
the
employer
yield
up
his
funds
to
an
employee
for
whom
you
had
an
independent
finding
or
probable
cause
that
the
employee
is
not
entitled
to
these
funds.
and
after
the
employer
has
established
his
defense
the
--
plus
the
fact
that
under
virginia
law
all
the
funds
that
are
paid
to
an
employee,
whether
under
mistake
or
whatever
by
an
employer
under
the
workmen’s
compensation
system
can
never
be
recouped.
there
is
no
right
of
employer
to
recoup
any
funds,
but
yet
if
the
employee’s
suspension
is
later
found
to
be
erroneous
then
the
employee
is
immediately
paid
up
to
date.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
they
could
permit
recoup,
but
i
think
probably
the
answer
and
this
gets
again
to
the
state's
arguments
that
delicate
balance
here
that
state
has
struck.
and
they
have
weighed
it
against
the
employers
because
i
think
they
have
found
it
was
not
--
the
state
found
it
was
not
in
the
state’s
interest
to
have
the
employer
pursuing
persons
who
just
come
off
of
workmen’s
compensation.
this
is
i
think
an
indication
of
the
state's
concern
for
the
well-being
of
the
employees.
it’s
something
we
employers
have
to
live
with,
but
today
it
hasn’t
become
access,
if
it
does
we
may
be
in
this
court
on
the
other
side
of
the
case.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
not
--
no,
your
honor.
not
that
the
annotation
show.
it's
not
a
presumption,
it
just
says
well
and
it
may
be
helpful
to
explain
this
because
i
don’t
think
that
the
court
--
it
hadn’t
been
explained
the
court
exactly
how
this
system
operates.
in
virginia,
if
there’s
an
accident,
it
appears
to
be
a
compensable
accident
and
the
disability
has
to
run
more
than
seven
days
or
there
has
to
be
medical
expenditures,
the
employer
and
employee
in
95%
of
the
cases
enter
into
a
stipulation
and
it
is
entered
--
then
entered
by
the
commission
as
an
order.
the
order
speaks
that
the
employer
shall
pay
specified
benefits
during
incapacity.
by
statue,
this
order
continues
until
it
is
amended
or
altered
by
the
commission
after
a
full
due
process
hearing.
any
amounts
paid
there
under
are
not
recouped
by
the
employer.
what
the
rule
13
that
that
you’ve
heard
about
is
a
procedural
addition
or
enhancement
of
employee’s
rights.
as
it
was
stated
earlier,
these
commission
awards
are
not
enforceable
by
the
commission
and
must
be
enforced
in
the
court
of
record.
so,
if
the
employer
or
the
insurance
carrier
didn’t
pay
it
have
to
go
in
the
court
and
sue.
the
industrial
commission,
in
the
30’s
created
rule
13
which
says
in
effect
the
only
way
that
employer
can
check
and
alter
this
award
is
to
come
to
us
for
a
hearing.
but
we’re
not
going
to
receive
an
application
for
a
hearing
until
you
pay
that
employee
up
until
the
date
of
the
application.
and
the
subsequent
amendments
have
said
we
are
not
going
to
give
you
a
hearing
until
you
have
given
us
evidence
which
shows
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there’s
been
a
change
in
condition.
what
they
have
done
--
what
the
commission
has
done
is
to
limit
the
employer’s
right
to
this
due
process
hearing.
and
a
by-product
of
this
has
been
to
give
the
employee
some
additional
claims
to
funds
without
having
to
go
to
a
court.
and
what
they
are
claiming
is
their
property
right
is
this
future
extension
which
they
have
never
had.
and
the
roth
case,
i
think
recognizes
that
it’s
a
sort
of
a
unilateral
wish,
but
it’s
nothing
that’s
found
in
the
state
statute
that
you
can
really
complain
as
property
rights.
a
couple
of
corrections
on
the
error
on
the
record.
coverage
does
not
extend
to
all
employers
and
all
employees
in
state.
that
statute
applied
is
mandatory
for
employers
of
three
or
more
employees.
employers
of
smaller
in
numbers
can
come
under
the
act
but
they
do
so
voluntarily.
coverage,
thus,
is
not
mandatory
and
further
more,
the
contract
does
issue
to
the
employee.
it
doesn’t
get
a
written
copy,
but
the
virginia
code
section
65.1-111
says
in
effect
that
the
employee
shall
be
allowed
to
bring
an
action
his
own
name
against
the
insurance
company
on
the
contract.
the
real
question
here
i
think
is
the
property
that
the
employer
is
going
to
lose.
you’ve
got
a
system
where
the
employer,
his
natural
interest
is
to
suspend
payment.
now,
the
fact
that
he
suspends
payment
after
this
initial
hearing
doesn’t
mean
that
the
employee
cannot
go
into
the
court
and
enforce
it
because
he
can.
he
can
always
go
into
court
and
enforce
it
even
after
commission
has
found
probable
cause
to
believe
that
there
is
a
changing
condition.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
well,
your
honor
if
you
read
goldberg
together
with
roth,
i
think
it
does.
the
right
that
they
have
got
--
the
enforceable
right
is
in
this
award
and
this
award
must
be
enforced
in
the
court
of
record.
and
even
after
the
employer
has
gotten
a
hearing
until
that
order
issues
out
of
the
commission
at
some
later
date,
that
award
continues
to
be
enforced.
and
he
gets
--
it
can
be
sued
on
and
get
judgment,
almost
a
confession
of
judgment
even
up
until
the
day
the
commission
rescinds
that
order
or
amends
that
order.
so,
he
still
has
the
enforceable
right
in
court.
what
he
is
asking
for
is
some
sort
of
decision
by
the
commission
to
call
up
the
employer
and
say,
“well,
we
got
a
favorable
decision
for
this
man
is
not
entitled
the
money
but
we
are
not
going
to
release
this
decision
until
you
pay
him
up
to
date.”
and
that's
the
time
situation
--
you
get
to
the
problem.
there
are
two
competing
claims
of
the
contract
in
nature
between
the
employer
and
the
employee.
every
dollar
the
employer
pays
comes
out
of
his
pocket
or
his
insurance
company’s
pocket
and
they’ll
get
it
back
from
it,
but
what
--
the
money
he
pays
that’s
unjustified
he
can
never
recover
from
the
claimant.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
well,
that
would
be
a
problem
of
disability,
your
honor
and
there
is
no
probation
for
any
payment
for
cessation
of
payment.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
oh!
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
right.
it's
the
same
type
of
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
in
case,
well,
he
is
notified
but
even
assuming
that’s
true
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
it
depends
on
the
circumstances,
your
honor.
but
i
am
assuming
that
he
is
not.
i
mean,
i
am
willing
to
assume
for
the
purposes
of
my
argument
that
he
is
not,
that
the
employer
doesn't
tell
the
employee,
but
our
argument
is
that
there
is
no
jurisdiction
under
1983
because
our
suspension
is
pursuant
to
the
right
of
a
person
in
free
society
to
do
that
which
is
not
by
law
prohibited.
the
law
does
not
prohibit
us
from
suspending
under
certain
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
right.
the
case
is
here
to
determine
whether
or
not
state
in
action
is
--
state
action
under
1983
and
as
we
read
1983,
it
requires
either
a
positive
state
law
requiring
someone
to
terminate
or
such
a
degree
of
intertwining
between
the
employers
in
the
state
so
that
the
employers
actions
are
the
state's
actions.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
it
will
--
the
commission’s
determination
of
probable
cause
is
completely
irrelevant.
it
has
no
relationship
to
the
award.
the
award
is
still
outstanding.
the
award
has
not
been
modified.
hence,
it
is
enforceable
of
right
under
section
100
or
101.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
yes.
and
the
employer
as
far
as
we
can
feel,
has
no
real
defense.
it’s
a
system
that
has
not
been
abused
and
so
it
hasn't
been
protectively
attacked
but
that’s
our
point.
that
he
always
has
that
right
even
after
the
determination
of
probable
cause
to
go
into
court
and
to
enforce
a
judgment
on
the
award
itself.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
well,
they
go
to
the
state
agency,
your
honor,
the
95%
figure
i
believe
is
a
question
of
initial
entitlement.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
any
agreement
between
the
employer
and
the
employee
respecting
compensation
payments
after
an
injury
must
be
approved
by
the
industrial
commission.
the
employer
and
employee
if
they
agree
to
entitlement,
it’s
really
just
a
question
was
there
compensable
acts
beyond
seven
days,
sign
a
form
which
i
believe
is
in
the
record
entitled
a
memorandum
of
agreement.
that
memorandum
of
agreement
is
submitted
to
the
industrial
commission
which
if
they
review
it
and
find
it
to
be
in
satisfactory
order
and
properly
protecting
the
interest
of
the
employees
will
enforce
it.
then
it
will
issue
as
an
order
of
the
commission
requiring
compensation
payments
to
be
made
during
incapacity.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
i
am
not
sure
if
the
figure
is
that
high.
it’s
very
high.
it’s
very,
very
much
an
informal
system
in
the
sense
that
you
don’t
have
a
lot
of
play
by
counsel.
it
works
pretty
much
with
voluntary
system
overseen
by
the
industrial
commission
which
significantly
favors
the
employee.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
yes.
if
it’s
not.
there
had
been
some
cases
where
the
agreement
was
not
approved
by
the
commission.
the
commission,
unless
they
approve
it
and
enter
an
order
affecting
the
initial
award,
the
initial
award
remains
outstanding.
as
in
the
manchester
case
which
i
think
everybody
has
cited
to
the
court
the
award
remained
outstanding
for
perhaps
a
year-and-a-half
after
the
employee
went
back
to
work.
the
question
was
is
an
enforcement
of
these
circumstances
because
of
harsh
results
to
the
employer
and
the
court
held
that
you
can
only
get
to
the
commission
through
rule
99.
the
employer
had
not
done
it
to
specify
date
in
that
year-and-half's
award.
although
perhaps
he
wasn’t
entitled
it,
it
was
enforceable
in
the
court
of
record.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
right
your
honor.
and
that
order
is
effected
only
by
a
hearing
which
i
believe
everybody
admits
is
a
due
process
hearing.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
notice
was
given
to
mr.
dillard,
your
honor.
one
of
the
papers
filed
in
the
record
shows
a
carbon
copy
to
mr.
dillard,
that
was
not
under
rule
13.
the
rule
13
as
it
now
stands
has
been
changed.
that
was
sort
of
old
rule
13
thing.
he
did
get
notice
on
it
nevertheless
and
then
mr.
williams,
the
exhibit
mr.
williams’
case
which
is
exhibit
“a”
on
page
75
of
the
record
also
shows
that
he
gets
a
notice.
it’s
not
in
the
record
but
the
industrial
commission
has
a
practice
that
if
they
receive
an
application
for
a
hearing
on
change
of
condition
and
there
is
no
indication
that
the
employee
has
been
notified,
they
have
a
form
on
which
they
immediately
notify
the
employee.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
i
am
not
sure
that
--
how
--
if
i
can
answer
that
completely.
if
the
employee
calls
up
and
submits
a
medical
report
i
think
they
would
consider
it.
they
want
him
to
know
as
soon
as
possible
and
i
think
probably
as
a
practical
matter
if
it
turns
out
to
be
a
mistake
on
the
part
of
the
employers
what
i
understand
in
the
industrial
commission’s
working,
that
application
is
going
to
be
withdrawn
right
quickly
and
things
will
be
restored
in
status
quo.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
your
honor,
there
is
a
fair
degree
of
response.
i
can’t
characterize
it
as
a
high
degree
or
low
degree.
i
think
the
answer
is
that
only,
maybe
10%
of
these
go
to
a
hearing
and
eventually
go
to
a
hearing
where
both
parties
appear.
hearing
is
automatically
scheduled.
the
employer
has
the
obligation
in
scheduling
the
hearing
as
this
shows
the
obligation
of
coming
forward.
the
number
of
these
that
go
to
hearing
are
not
substantial,
so
one
way
or
another
there
is
an
agreement
reached.
sometimes
it’s
difficult
for
practical
matter
to
get
people
in
that
wage
bracket
to
sign
an
agreement
to
anything.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
there
--
well,
there
is
no
problem
under
the
situation
as
it
now
exists
although
that
award
continues
and
he
can
go
into
court
presumably
and
enforce
it
even
then
up
until
the
hearing.
now,
after
the
hearing
and
the
order
issues
confirming
that
he
is
back
at
work
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
right.
i
am
not
sure
the
letter
does.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
it
does.
well,
the
court
is
ready
to
look
close
and
i
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
no.
as
to
what
your
honor?
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
as
to
what?
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
right.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
no.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
yes.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
yes.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
no,
it
has
no
relationship
your
honor.
the
probable
cause
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
it’s
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
which
is
a
green
brief
that’s
virginia
code
section
65.1-100
and
all
he
has
to
do
is
show
the
court
that
he’s
got
an
award
by
the
commission
that’s
outstanding
and
it
has
not
been
modified
and
the
amounts
that
have
been
paid
and
he
gets
an
order
immediately.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
the
termination
based
on
probable
cause
does
not
--
has
no
relationship
to
the
award.
if
the
award
continues
until
the
due
process
hearing,
what
the
commission
says
in
that
rule,
we
will
not
let
the
employer
even
file
an
application
for
a
hearing.
we
won’t
give
the
employer
a
standing
to
even
argue
a
change
in
condition
until
he
has
paid
the
employee
up
to
date
and
shown
probable
cause.
it's
a
device
of
controlling
as
much
as
anything
controlling
the
number
of
cases
which
they
receive.
it
is
like
the
old
common
law
of
court
requiring
it
to
be
on
oath.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
yes.
i
can
construe
this
section
no
other
way.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
right.
that’s
the
holding
in
the
manchester.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
no,
the
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
it
wasn’t
terminated
during
that
period
but
the
commission’s
order
in
most
cases
dates
back
to
the
date
the
application
was
received.
now,
if
it’s
been
enforced
meantime
then
the
employers
--
[laughter
attempt]
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
not
to
the
date
of
hearing,
to
the
date
of
the
application.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
right.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
in
answer
to
the
question
on
the
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
your
honor
we
ask
the
same
question.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
right.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
the
way
we
read
this
section.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
no,
that’s
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
right.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
right.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
right.
as
this
section
the
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
at
what
point
in
time
now?
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
right.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
right.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that’s
right.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
well,
in
the
sense
there
is
--
in
the
sense
there’s
a
contractual.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
i
almost
have
just
after
--
well,
it’s
a
contractual
duty
now
whether
the
moral
onus
is
something
else,
but
they
do
have
a
continuing
award
requiring
them
to
pay
and
they
don’t
pay.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
the
one,
the
decision
on
this
--
the
best
i
can
find
from
quickly
looking
at
the
annotations,
one
called
parrigen
v.
long,
134
southeast
562
which
says
that
under
section
100
which
is
the
enforcement
section
that
the
court’s
duty
is
strictly
ministerial.
it
can
inquire
--
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
it
can
inquire
into
the
whether
or
not
the
employee
was
actually
entitled.
it
goes
back
to
what
we
said
before.
we
have
got
a
system
that
has
worked
on
a
voluntary
basis.
the
employees,
the
hearing
is
on
a
fairly
short
basis
and
there
have
not
been
a
large
number
of
suits
of
this
type.
but
i
think
the
answer
is
most
the
determination
particular
under
the
new
rule
13
are
justified.
employees
are
back
at
work.
mr.
j.
robert
brame,
iii
that
was
the
manchester
case
which
is
cited
in
our
brief;
it
was
cited
in
everybody’s
brief.
