warren
e.
burger
--
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
impression
that
somewhere
in
the
record,
the
united
states
attorney
had
referred
to
the
youth
--
the
act
was
at
the
arraignment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you’ve
already
said
or
at
least
i
thought
i
heard
you
say
that
if
you’ve
been
sentence
the
youth
corrections
act,
he
might
have
got
as
much
as
six
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
judge
phillips
testify
to
and
several
other
federal
judges
including
the
chairman
of
the
committee
of
the
judicial
conference?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
(inaudible)
by
congress.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
congress?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
the
requirements?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
directing
it
to
something
else,
i
am
directing
it
at
your
statement
that
they
have
conceded
that
they
would
not
object
to
such
a
requirement.
could
you
to
construe
to
mean
they
wouldn’t
object
if
congress
wrote
a
statute
that
way
or
a
court
construed
it
that
way
or
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
but
we
don’t
establish
policies,
we
construe
statutes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
i
understand
you
to
say
before
that
if
this
case
went
back,
if
you
prevail
and
the
case
went
back
that
he
could
not
now
be
sentenced
under
the
youth
corrections
act
to
any
greater
or
different
sentence
from
the
one
that
was
impose,
that’s
90
days
plus
probation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
the
youth
corrections
act
would
be
frustrated,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh,
could
you
give
him
the
six
years?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
norton?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
i
understand
you
are
trying
to
say
that
the
sentencing
hearing
and
the
preliminary
hearing
were
at
the
same
time,
that
this
was
a
telescope
preceding?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
rule
10
hearing
is
when
he
was
actually
attempted
to
sentence
him.
that
did
not
go
from
preliminary
hearing
to
arraignment
and
then
to
sentencing
hearing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that’s
where
the
discussion
of
the
youth
correction
act
occurred
by
the
united
states
attorney?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
there
is
no
question
that
the
subject
matter
of
the
youth
corrections
act
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
judge
at
that
time?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
one
case
in
the
district
of
columbia

where
on
a
guilty
plea,

time,

in
anyway
from

to
place
the
defendant,
a
convicted
person
on

or
not
