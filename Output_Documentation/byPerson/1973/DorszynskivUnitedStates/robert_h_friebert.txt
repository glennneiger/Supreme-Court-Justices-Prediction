mr.
robert
h.
friebert
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
please
the
court.
my
name
robert
friebert
and
i
represent
the
petitioner
douglas
raymond
dorszynski.
the
respondent
is
united
states
of
america.
this
case
involves
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
and
this
case
originally
arose
out
of
an
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin,
the
honorable
myron
l.
gordon
presiding.
the
issue
involves
an
interpretation
of
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
and
in
particular,
the
issue
involves
the
procedural
requirements
which
must
be
met
before
a
youth
offender
can
be
sentenced
as
an
adult.
the
act
and
the
particular
point
in
question
states
as
follows
and
this
is
title
18
5010
(d).
“if
the
court
shall
find
that
the
youth
offender
will
not
derive
benefit
from
treatment
under
the
“act”
then
the
court
may
sentence
the
youth
offender
under
any
other
applicable
penalty
provision.”
synthesized
further
then,
the
issue
before
the
court
here
is
whether
a
sentencing
court,
sentencing
a
youth
offender
who
is
a
defendant
under
the
age
of
22
must
articulate
its
findings
of
no
benefit
on
the
record
and
further
whether
the
sentencing
court
must
support
that
finding
with
reasons.
the
facts
are
as
follows.
petitioner
douglas
dorszynski
was
convicted
of
possession
of
lsd
in
violation
of
21
u.s.(c).
844
(a)
at
a
time
when
he
was
19
years
old.
he
was
no
longer
juvenile,
but
he
was
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
federal
youth
corrections
act.
the
particular
charge
involved
was
a
misdemeanor,
subjecting
him
to
a
maximum
penalty
were
he
simply
an
adult
to
one
year
in
jail
or
a
prison.
the
petitioner
pled
guilty.
the
trial
court
sentenced
the
petitioner
to
a
split
sentence
of
90
days
in
jail
to
be
followed
by
a
probationary
period
outside
of
jail
for
two
years.
at
the
time
of
his
arraignment
and
his
plea
of
guilty,
he
was
not
told
that
he
could
be
sentenced
under
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
for
period
of
control
or
in
essence
of
about
six
years
with
four
years
in
prison.
at
the
sentencing
proceeding,
the
trial
court
never
mentioned
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
when
it
imposed
its
sentence
as
an
adult.
post
trial
motions
were
filed
which
challenged
the
adult’s
sentence
and
challenged
it
in
particular
on
the
grounds
that
the
trial
court
had
made
no
findings
on
his
reasons
why
he
rejected
a
sentence
under
the
federal
youth
corrections
act.
at
the
time
of
the
post
trial
motions,
the
sentencing
court
stated
that
the
act
was
not
applicable
and
he
further
stated
that
he,
when
he
sentenced
the
youth
offender
as
an
adult
that
there
was
implied
finding
on
his
behalf
and
he
said
no
more.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
trial
judge
did
not
have
to
explain
his
reasons
in
any
way
as
to
why
he
did
not
sentence
under
the
federal
youth
corrections
act,
or
why
he
made
a
finding
of
no
benefit
under
the
act
and
affirmed
this
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
the
act
was
referred
to
twice
at
the
arraignment.
it
was
under
the
provisions
of
the
code.
the
defendant
stated
that
he
was
going
to
plead
guilty
and
the
pre-sentence
investigation
was
done
before
he
came
into
courts
so
the
proceedings
at
the
arraignment
was
also
a
sentencing
proceeding
with
benefit
of
a
pre-sentence
report.
the
united
states
attorney
in
court
stated
that
the
defendant
was
a
youth
offender
and
subject
to
the
youth
offender’s
act,
but
he
did
not
state
that
the
youth
offender’s
act
subjected
the
petitioner
to
potential
four
years
incarceration.
this
was
followed
by
the
same
assistant
united
states
attorney
stating
that
the
penalty
maximum
was
one
year
which
was
an
incorrect
statement
of
the
law
under
the
circumstances
because
the
maximum
penalty
was
six
years
in
actuality.
then
the
judge
made
that
statement
and
further
emphasized
the
one
year
maximum
to
the
petitioner.
after
the
plea
of
guilty
was
entered,
the
court
recessed
to
consider
the
pre-sentence
investigation
report
which
had
been
previously
prepared.
upon
reconvening,
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
was
mentioned
the
second
time,
and
that
was
by
the
petitioner’s
counsel
at
that
time
who
asked
that
probation
be
given
to
the
petitioner
and
that
this
probation
be
under
the
federal
youth
corrections
act.
the
trial
court
then
imposed
the
split
sentence
of
90
days
in
custody
to
be
followed
by
two
years
probation
without
in
any
way
commenting
upon
the
federal
youth
corrections
act.
the
only
time
the
trial
court
commented
on
the
act
was
in
the
post
conviction
hearings
when
he
said
that
a
finding
that
the
act
was
inapplicable
could
be
implied
from
the
record
in
the
case
and
he
stated
no
reasons
in
the
post
trial,
post
conviction
hearing’s
either.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct.
that’s
correct,
which
leads
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
mr.
justice
powell,
i
would
still
be
here
saying
that
that
was
an
insufficient
record
that
you
would
have
to
support
his
findings
with
appropriate
reasons.
the
record
in
this
case
demonstrates
perhaps
what
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
he
has
to
gain
the
potential
created
by
congress
in
5021
of
title
18
and
upon
an
early
discharge
from
probation
that
his
conviction
will
be
wiped
from
his
record
and
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
on
this
record,
i
don’t
think
in
the
light
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce,
and
everything
else
that
he’d
be
able
to
do
anything,
but
probation,
unless
he
could
support
that
with
intervening
circumstances.
so,
probation
would
be
the
only
thing
in
the
picture
under
the
particular
facts
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no
--
yes,
i
say
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
--
that
the
word
inapplicable
is
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
he
could
impose
probation
under
the
act.
he
could
commit
him
as
a
youth
offender
under
the
act
and
it's
that
commitment
potential
which
puts
him
in
the
position
(voice
overlap)
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
that’s
correct,
but
probation
is
available
under
the
federal
youth
corrections
act.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct,
that’s
what
counsel
argued
probation
under
the
act.
the
confusion
i
think
in
this
record
demonstrates
a
serious
question
whether
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
was
really
considered
by
the
trial
judge.
that
the
petitioner
is
not
properly
advised
as
to
the
potential
penalties
which
he
faced,
which
leads
to
a
postulation
at
least
that
there
might
have
been
confusion
among
the
defense
attorney
and
everybody.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
think
that
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
creates
a
policy
by
congress
that
when
a
youth
offender
is
convicted,
that
the
options
available
to
a
sentencing
judge
are
circumscribed
by
the
act.
he
must
start
out
by
favoring
a
sentence
under
the
act.
and
because
that
is
a
favored
position
that
the
youth
offender
is
in
by
reason
of
his
very
age.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
would
change
the
language
slightly.
if
he
makes
no
finding
or
if
he
has
doubts,
or
if
he
does
not
even
consider
it,
the
sentence
must
be
under
the
act
that
the
only
time
an
adult
sentence
can
be
given
is
if
makes
a
specific
finding
of
no
benefit.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
with
reasons,
that’s
correct.
so,
i
would
--
he
does
not
in
my
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
don’t
believe
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
that
this
issue
was
considered
at
all.
what
the
legislative
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
those
judges
and
those
gentlemen
at
the
time
mr.
chief
justice
indicated
that
this
would
not
--
that
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
would
not
have
any
change
in
the
traditional
sentencing
patterns
given
to
a
sentencing
judge.
i
don’t
believe
that
those
statements
demonstrate
any
consideration
of
the
issue
involved
in
this
case.
that’s
the
principal
position
of
the
government
that
somehow
a
statement
of
--
that
this
doesn’t
change
traditional
sentencing
alternatives
of
a
sentencing
judge,
magically
changes
its
form
into
a
statement
that
a
trial
judge
is
not
required
under
this
act
to
state
reasons.
in
fact,
the
traditional
sentencing
prerogatives
of
a
court
at
no
time
gave
a
trial
judge
unfettered
discretion
without
any
review
of
his
discretion.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
the
actual
language
of
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
in
the
word
of
art
shall
find.
i
think
the
phrase
in
the
word
find
is
a
legal
word
of
art,
which
is
not
in
any
way
confusing
to
anyone.
it
means
findings
and
supported
by
reasons
because
that’s
the
way
i
believe
that
lawyers
communicate
which
other.
if
the
court
shall
find
that
the
youth
offender
will
not
derive
benefit
means
just
that,
he
shall
make
a
finding
and
support
it
with
the
reasons.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
think
it’s
implicit
in
the
record
that
might
be
before
the
court
as
to
whether
his
findings
conform
with
the
evidence
which
was
before
him.
and
if
you
have
a
sentencing
proceeding,
you
have
nothing
but
a
most
barren
record.
all
you
have
is
a
charge,
a
pre-sentence
report,
and
a
judge
not
saying
anything.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes
your
honor,
mr.
justice
white,
but
it
doesn’t
even
indicate
that
the
trial
judge
relied
upon
the
pre-sentence
report.
he
said
nothing.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
believe
then
it’s
our
position
that
one
statement
that
court
shall
find
with
a
barren
record
as
we
have
here
that
it
must
support
its
findings
and
that
position
--
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct,
that’s
my
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
that’s
correct.
i
might
state
that
the
government
does
not
seem
to
fervently
argue
that
this
should
not
be
a
record.
in
fact,
they
state
that
--
at
pages
48
and
49
of
their
brief
that
they
would
not
oppose
a
requirement
for
an
express
finding
that
the
youth
offender
would
not
benefit
under
the
act.
and
this
court
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
am
sorry.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
that
the
finding?
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
the
requirement
of
a
finding?
i
first
start
with
the
proposition
that
the
word
find
is
a
legal
word
of
art
and
that’s
a
statement
of
congress.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
think
in
the
context
of
their
position
is
at
if
this
court
were
to
establish
such
a
policy,
they
would
not
oppose
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
and
this
court
also
establishes
policies
in
the
light
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce
to
effectuate
an
increased
penalty.
there
must
be
a
record
with
findings
to
support
an
increased
penalty
after
a
defendant
has
been
re-convicted
after
reversal
of
his
original
conviction.
that
enforces
a
policy,
a
constitutional
policy.
spectre
versus
morsee
which
is
another
sentencing
proceeding
in
which
a
colorado
sex
crimes
act
was
imposed
as
a
sentence
after
a
conviction.
this
court
said
that
that
type
of
commitment
namely
as
a
sex
offender
required
an
additional
finding
and
that
therefore,
the
sentencing
judge
cannot
just
commit
as
a
sex
offender.
even
though
he
had
been
convicted
of
a
crime
but
he
must
make
the
move
finding,
he
must
support
the
new
finding
after
notice
and
a
hearing
and
he
must
state
his
reasons
on
the
record
as
to
why
he
made
that
finding
so
that
it
would
be
subjected
properly
to
appellant
review.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes
i
think
of
then
the
trial
judge
runs
across
north
carolina
versus
pearce,
it’s
an
increase
penalty.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
i
don’t
think
the
youth
corrections
act
would
be
frustrating.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
the
man
has
served
in
fact
his
90
days.
after
--
he
is
now
presently
on
probation.
we’ve
not
sought
any
stay
pending
a
review
by
this
court.
the
judge
what
we
would
ask
him
to
do
is
to
sentence
him
under
5010
(a)
to
probation
under
the
federal
youth
corrections
act.
and
that
would
be
the
sentence
which
we
would
be
seeking
which
would
not
in
any
way
frustrate
any
of
the
policies
enunciated
previously
and
is
probably
the
most
appropriate
sentence
under
this
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
he
would
be
able
to
have
his
conviction
right
from
the
record
where
the
discharge
from
probation
prior
to
his
completion
of
his
probation
period
is
substantial
benefit.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
am
sorry
and
excuse
me.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
it
would
be
automatic
if
he
were
released
from
probation
prior
to
the
completion
of
his
probation
period.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
he
would
be
in
the
hands
of
the
probation
department,
the
same
probation
department
that
would
take
him
whether
he
is
on
probation
under
the
act
or
not.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
believed
so.
i
don’t
know
of
any
standards
that
differ.
it
would
be
with
the
probation
department
of
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin.
so
that's
the
substantial
--
the
substantial
benefit
in
this
case
is
the
ability
to
obtain
the
ending
of
the
encumbrance
of
his
previous
conviction
and
that’s
the
substantial
benefit
which
the
act
provides.
one
of
the
substantial
benefits
that
happens
to
be
in
this
particular
case,
the
substantial
benefit
which
brings
us
to
this
court
and
that
being
a
substantial
benefit,
being
a
substantial
congressionally
mandated
benefit
is
in
fact
a
right
that
he
has
unless
the
court
makes
a
finding
of
no
benefit.
and
there
was
no
such
finding
and
since
the
finding
of
no
benefit
is
the
equivalent
of
taking
away
a
substantial
congressionally
created
right,
then
it
is
our
position
that
both
the
statute
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
then
we
would
be
able
to
have
a
determination
as
to
whether
those
were
appropriate
reasons
under
the
act.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
perhaps.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
the
hearing,
i
don’t
mean
to
overstate
that
prospect,
the
hearing
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
perhaps
present
evidence,
i
am
not
so
sure
about
cross
examining
witnesses.
in
fact,
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
don’t
think
there
is
--
as
a
practical
matter
this
pre-sentence
report
is
not
a
part
of
this
record.
there
is
nothing
that
would
affect
that
in
this
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
if
the
trial
judge
is
going
to
rely
upon
a
statement
in
the
pre-sentence
report
with
--
of
involving
a
witness
or
another
person
with
which
we
disagree
with,
i
think,
we
would
have
the
right
and
the
prerogative
to
challenge
that.
and
i
don’t
think
that
williams
versus
new
york
touches
on
that
issue
whatsoever.
williams
is
the
case
apparently,
principally
relied
upon
by
the
government.
in
williams,
the
only
challenge
was
that
a
sentencing
judge
who
would
impose
the
death
sentence
instead
of
life
imprisonment
after
a
jury
came
in
with
a
recommendation
of
life
imprisonment,
whether
the
defense
had
a
right
to
totally
cross
examine
and
be
confronted
by
the
witnesses
on
evidence
or
statements
which
appeared
in
the
pre-sentence
report.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
think
the
court
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
well
it's
going

mr.
robert

well,
perhaps
as
furman

is,
the
statement
is
that
not
being
a

mr.
robert

and
the

it
is
not
true.
he
has
been
in
prison

a

of
30

he
is
entitled
i
would
think
to
a
hearing.
mr.
robert

to
determine
whether
that’s
true
or
not.
mr.
robert

the

might
be

there
was

there
has

mr.

attack
the

the
factual
basis
of
the
finding.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
of
29
and
half
years?
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
he
attacks
that
finding
by
the
probation
department
is
not
being
true
or
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
perhaps.
i
don’t
know
whose
burden
it
would
be.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
well,
i
think
i

excuse
me.
mr.
robert

no,
i
think
the
way
i
read
the
entire
file
--
(voice

mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct,
without
any
statement.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct.
but
it
is
the
triggering
device
for
bringing
a
youth
offender
into
a
sentence
as
an
adult.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes
that
would
--
that
raises
an
issue
which
i
raised
in
seventh
circuit
and
which
has
been
uniformly
rejected
by
every
circuit
court
that’s
seen
it
to
date
as
far
as
i
know
and
that’s
that
there
is
only
one
kind
of
probation
under
the
act,
and
namely
that
the
youth
offender
is
placed
on
probation
he
is
automatically
under
the
act.
i
point
that
out
at
page
21
of
my
brief
and
the
footnote
that
that
issue
has
been
rejected.
if
that’s
a
correct
interpretation,
then
he
is
on
probation
and
under
the
act
now
in
which
case
the
issue
which
i
bring
to
you
is
not
here.
but
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
but
the
general
least
consensus
is
of
which
i
disagree
is
that
you
can
make
a
finding
of
no
benefit
and
go
to
an
adult
sentencing
proceeding
and
put
the
defendant
on
probation.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct,
and
that
sentencing
under
the
act
is
either
an
(a),
(b),
or
(c)
sentence;
either
probation,
commitment,
or
which
is
(c)
which
is
not
applicable
which
would
extended
commitment
and
without
the
finding
under
(d),
that’s
his
option
and
nothing
more.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
it
is
a
youth
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
it
is
probation
law
that
is
tailored
with
an
end
result.(voice

mr.
robert
h.
friebert
well,
i
believe
probation
is
treatment.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
it
is,
since
it
is
not
a
serious
offense,
the
sentencing
judge
who
believes
the
youth
offender
should
be
given
probation
would
seem
to
me
should
be
by
congressional
mandate
entitled
to
have
his
conviction
light.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
that’s
correct.
my
time
is
up.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
please
the
court.
my
name
robert
friebert
and
i
represent
the
petitioner
douglas
raymond
dorszynski.
the
respondent
is
united
states
of
america.
this
case
involves
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
and
this
case
originally
arose
out
of
an
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin,
the
honorable
myron
l.
gordon
presiding.
the
issue
involves
an
interpretation
of
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
and
in
particular,
the
issue
involves
the
procedural
requirements
which
must
be
met
before
a
youth
offender
can
be
sentenced
as
an
adult.
the
act
and
the
particular
point
in
question
states
as
follows
and
this
is
title
18
5010
(d).
“if
the
court
shall
find
that
the
youth
offender
will
not
derive
benefit
from
treatment
under
the
“act”
then
the
court
may
sentence
the
youth
offender
under
any
other
applicable
penalty
provision.”
synthesized
further
then,
the
issue
before
the
court
here
is
whether
a
sentencing
court,
sentencing
a
youth
offender
who
is
a
defendant
under
the
age
of
22
must
articulate
its
findings
of
no
benefit
on
the
record
and
further
whether
the
sentencing
court
must
support
that
finding
with
reasons.
the
facts
are
as
follows.
petitioner
douglas
dorszynski
was
convicted
of
possession
of
lsd
in
violation
of
21
u.s.(c).
844
(a)
at
a
time
when
he
was
19
years
old.
he
was
no
longer
juvenile,
but
he
was
subject
to
the
provisions
of
the
federal
youth
corrections
act.
the
particular
charge
involved
was
a
misdemeanor,
subjecting
him
to
a
maximum
penalty
were
he
simply
an
adult
to
one
year
in
jail
or
a
prison.
the
petitioner
pled
guilty.
the
trial
court
sentenced
the
petitioner
to
a
split
sentence
of
90
days
in
jail
to
be
followed
by
a
probationary
period
outside
of
jail
for
two
years.
at
the
time
of
his
arraignment
and
his
plea
of
guilty,
he
was
not
told
that
he
could
be
sentenced
under
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
for
period
of
control
or
in
essence
of
about
six
years
with
four
years
in
prison.
at
the
sentencing
proceeding,
the
trial
court
never
mentioned
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
when
it
imposed
its
sentence
as
an
adult.
post
trial
motions
were
filed
which
challenged
the
adult’s
sentence
and
challenged
it
in
particular
on
the
grounds
that
the
trial
court
had
made
no
findings
on
his
reasons
why
he
rejected
a
sentence
under
the
federal
youth
corrections
act.
at
the
time
of
the
post
trial
motions,
the
sentencing
court
stated
that
the
act
was
not
applicable
and
he
further
stated
that
he,
when
he
sentenced
the
youth
offender
as
an
adult
that
there
was
implied
finding
on
his
behalf
and
he
said
no
more.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
that
the
trial
judge
did
not
have
to
explain
his
reasons
in
any
way
as
to
why
he
did
not
sentence
under
the
federal
youth
corrections
act,
or
why
he
made
a
finding
of
no
benefit
under
the
act
and
affirmed
this
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
the
act
was
referred
to
twice
at
the
arraignment.
it
was
under
the
provisions
of
the
code.
the
defendant
stated
that
he
was
going
to
plead
guilty
and
the
pre-sentence
investigation
was
done
before
he
came
into
courts
so
the
proceedings
at
the
arraignment
was
also
a
sentencing
proceeding
with
benefit
of
a
pre-sentence
report.
the
united
states
attorney
in
court
stated
that
the
defendant
was
a
youth
offender
and
subject
to
the
youth
offender’s
act,
but
he
did
not
state
that
the
youth
offender’s
act
subjected
the
petitioner
to
potential
four
years
incarceration.
this
was
followed
by
the
same
assistant
united
states
attorney
stating
that
the
penalty
maximum
was
one
year
which
was
an
incorrect
statement
of
the
law
under
the
circumstances
because
the
maximum
penalty
was
six
years
in
actuality.
then
the
judge
made
that
statement
and
further
emphasized
the
one
year
maximum
to
the
petitioner.
after
the
plea
of
guilty
was
entered,
the
court
recessed
to
consider
the
pre-sentence
investigation
report
which
had
been
previously
prepared.
upon
reconvening,
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
was
mentioned
the
second
time,
and
that
was
by
the
petitioner’s
counsel
at
that
time
who
asked
that
probation
be
given
to
the
petitioner
and
that
this
probation
be
under
the
federal
youth
corrections
act.
the
trial
court
then
imposed
the
split
sentence
of
90
days
in
custody
to
be
followed
by
two
years
probation
without
in
any
way
commenting
upon
the
federal
youth
corrections
act.
the
only
time
the
trial
court
commented
on
the
act
was
in
the
post
conviction
hearings
when
he
said
that
a
finding
that
the
act
was
inapplicable
could
be
implied
from
the
record
in
the
case
and
he
stated
no
reasons
in
the
post
trial,
post
conviction
hearing’s
either.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct.
that’s
correct,
which
leads
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
mr.
justice
powell,
i
would
still
be
here
saying
that
that
was
an
insufficient
record
that
you
would
have
to
support
his
findings
with
appropriate
reasons.
the
record
in
this
case
demonstrates
perhaps
what
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
he
has
to
gain
the
potential
created
by
congress
in
5021
of
title
18
and
upon
an
early
discharge
from
probation
that
his
conviction
will
be
wiped
from
his
record
and
that
(voice

mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
on
this
record,
i
don’t
think
in
the
light
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce,
and
everything
else
that
he’d
be
able
to
do
anything,
but
probation,
unless
he
could
support
that
with
intervening
circumstances.
so,
probation
would
be
the
only
thing
in
the
picture
under
the
particular
facts
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no
--
yes,
i
say
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
--
that
the
word
inapplicable
is
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
he
could
impose
probation
under
the
act.
he
could
commit
him
as
a
youth
offender
under
the
act
and
it's
that
commitment
potential
which
puts
him
in
the
position
(voice
overlap)
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
that’s
correct,
but
probation
is
available
under
the
federal
youth
corrections
act.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct,
that’s
what
counsel
argued
probation
under
the
act.
the
confusion
i
think
in
this
record
demonstrates
a
serious
question
whether
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
was
really
considered
by
the
trial
judge.
that
the
petitioner
is
not
properly
advised
as
to
the
potential
penalties
which
he
faced,
which
leads
to
a
postulation
at
least
that
there
might
have
been
confusion
among
the
defense
attorney
and
everybody.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
think
that
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
creates
a
policy
by
congress
that
when
a
youth
offender
is
convicted,
that
the
options
available
to
a
sentencing
judge
are
circumscribed
by
the
act.
he
must
start
out
by
favoring
a
sentence
under
the
act.
and
because
that
is
a
favored
position
that
the
youth
offender
is
in
by
reason
of
his
very
age.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
would
change
the
language
slightly.
if
he
makes
no
finding
or
if
he
has
doubts,
or
if
he
does
not
even
consider
it,
the
sentence
must
be
under
the
act
that
the
only
time
an
adult
sentence
can
be
given
is
if
makes
a
specific
finding
of
no
benefit.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
with
reasons,
that’s
correct.
so,
i
would
--
he
does
not
in
my
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
don’t
believe
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
that
this
issue
was
considered
at
all.
what
the
legislative
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
those
judges
and
those
gentlemen
at
the
time
mr.
chief
justice
indicated
that
this
would
not
--
that
the
federal
youth
corrections
act
would
not
have
any
change
in
the
traditional
sentencing
patterns
given
to
a
sentencing
judge.
i
don’t
believe
that
those
statements
demonstrate
any
consideration
of
the
issue
involved
in
this
case.
that’s
the
principal
position
of
the
government
that
somehow
a
statement
of
--
that
this
doesn’t
change
traditional
sentencing
alternatives
of
a
sentencing
judge,
magically
changes
its
form
into
a
statement
that
a
trial
judge
is
not
required
under
this
act
to
state
reasons.
in
fact,
the
traditional
sentencing
prerogatives
of
a
court
at
no
time
gave
a
trial
judge
unfettered
discretion
without
any
review
of
his
discretion.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
the
actual
language
of
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
in
the
word
of
art
shall
find.
i
think
the
phrase
in
the
word
find
is
a
legal
word
of
art,
which
is
not
in
any
way
confusing
to
anyone.
it
means
findings
and
supported
by
reasons
because
that’s
the
way
i
believe
that
lawyers
communicate
which
other.
if
the
court
shall
find
that
the
youth
offender
will
not
derive
benefit
means
just
that,
he
shall
make
a
finding
and
support
it
with
the
reasons.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
think
it’s
implicit
in
the
record
that
might
be
before
the
court
as
to
whether
his
findings
conform
with
the
evidence
which
was
before
him.
and
if
you
have
a
sentencing
proceeding,
you
have
nothing
but
a
most
barren
record.
all
you
have
is
a
charge,
a
pre-sentence
report,
and
a
judge
not
saying
anything.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes
your
honor,
mr.
justice
white,
but
it
doesn’t
even
indicate
that
the
trial
judge
relied
upon
the
pre-sentence
report.
he
said
nothing.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
believe
then
it’s
our
position
that
one
statement
that
court
shall
find
with
a
barren
record
as
we
have
here
that
it
must
support
its
findings
and
that
position
--
(voice

mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct,
that’s
my
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
that’s
correct.
i
might
state
that
the
government
does
not
seem
to
fervently
argue
that
this
should
not
be
a
record.
in
fact,
they
state
that
--
at
pages
48
and
49
of
their
brief
that
they
would
not
oppose
a
requirement
for
an
express
finding
that
the
youth
offender
would
not
benefit
under
the
act.
and
this
court
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
am
sorry.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
that
the
finding?
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
the
requirement
of
a
finding?
i
first
start
with
the
proposition
that
the
word
find
is
a
legal
word
of
art
and
that’s
a
statement
of
congress.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
think
in
the
context
of
their
position
is
at
if
this
court
were
to
establish
such
a
policy,
they
would
not
oppose
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
and
this
court
also
establishes
policies
in
the
light
of
north
carolina
versus
pearce
to
effectuate
an
increased
penalty.
there
must
be
a
record
with
findings
to
support
an
increased
penalty
after
a
defendant
has
been
re-convicted
after
reversal
of
his
original
conviction.
that
enforces
a
policy,
a
constitutional
policy.
spectre
versus
morsee
which
is
another
sentencing
proceeding
in
which
a
colorado
sex
crimes
act
was
imposed
as
a
sentence
after
a
conviction.
this
court
said
that
that
type
of
commitment
namely
as
a
sex
offender
required
an
additional
finding
and
that
therefore,
the
sentencing
judge
cannot
just
commit
as
a
sex
offender.
even
though
he
had
been
convicted
of
a
crime
but
he
must
make
the
move
finding,
he
must
support
the
new
finding
after
notice
and
a
hearing
and
he
must
state
his
reasons
on
the
record
as
to
why
he
made
that
finding
so
that
it
would
be
subjected
properly
to
appellant
review.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes
i
think
of
then
the
trial
judge
runs
across
north
carolina
versus
pearce,
it’s
an
increase
penalty.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
i
don’t
think
the
youth
corrections
act
would
be
frustrating.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
the
man
has
served
in
fact
his
90
days.
after
--
he
is
now
presently
on
probation.
we’ve
not
sought
any
stay
pending
a
review
by
this
court.
the
judge
what
we
would
ask
him
to
do
is
to
sentence
him
under
5010
(a)
to
probation
under
the
federal
youth
corrections
act.
and
that
would
be
the
sentence
which
we
would
be
seeking
which
would
not
in
any
way
frustrate
any
of
the
policies
enunciated
previously
and
is
probably
the
most
appropriate
sentence
under
this
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
he
would
be
able
to
have
his
conviction
right
from
the
record
where
the
discharge
from
probation
prior
to
his
completion
of
his
probation
period
is
substantial
benefit.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
am
sorry
and
excuse
me.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
it
would
be
automatic
if
he
were
released
from
probation
prior
to
the
completion
of
his
probation
period.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
he
would
be
in
the
hands
of
the
probation
department,
the
same
probation
department
that
would
take
him
whether
he
is
on
probation
under
the
act
or
not.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
believed
so.
i
don’t
know
of
any
standards
that
differ.
it
would
be
with
the
probation
department
of
the
eastern
district
of
wisconsin.
so
that's
the
substantial
--
the
substantial
benefit
in
this
case
is
the
ability
to
obtain
the
ending
of
the
encumbrance
of
his
previous
conviction
and
that’s
the
substantial
benefit
which
the
act
provides.
one
of
the
substantial
benefits
that
happens
to
be
in
this
particular
case,
the
substantial
benefit
which
brings
us
to
this
court
and
that
being
a
substantial
benefit,
being
a
substantial
congressionally
mandated
benefit
is
in
fact
a
right
that
he
has
unless
the
court
makes
a
finding
of
no
benefit.
and
there
was
no
such
finding
and
since
the
finding
of
no
benefit
is
the
equivalent
of
taking
away
a
substantial
congressionally
created
right,
then
it
is
our
position
that
both
the
statute
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
then
we
would
be
able
to
have
a
determination
as
to
whether
those
were
appropriate
reasons
under
the
act.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
perhaps.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
the
hearing,
i
don’t
mean
to
overstate
that
prospect,
the
hearing
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
perhaps
present
evidence,
i
am
not
so
sure
about
cross
examining
witnesses.
in
fact,
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
don’t
think
there
is
--
as
a
practical
matter
this
pre-sentence
report
is
not
a
part
of
this
record.
there
is
nothing
that
would
affect
that
in
this
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
if
the
trial
judge
is
going
to
rely
upon
a
statement
in
the
pre-sentence
report
with
--
of
involving
a
witness
or
another
person
with
which
we
disagree
with,
i
think,
we
would
have
the
right
and
the
prerogative
to
challenge
that.
and
i
don’t
think
that
williams
versus
new
york
touches
on
that
issue
whatsoever.
williams
is
the
case
apparently,
principally
relied
upon
by
the
government.
in
williams,
the
only
challenge
was
that
a
sentencing
judge
who
would
impose
the
death
sentence
instead
of
life
imprisonment
after
a
jury
came
in
with
a
recommendation
of
life
imprisonment,
whether
the
defense
had
a
right
to
totally
cross
examine
and
be
confronted
by
the
witnesses
on
evidence
or
statements
which
appeared
in
the
pre-sentence
report.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
i
think
the
court
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
well
it's
going
to
have
be
i
would
believe
mr.
justice
marshall
some
kind
of
record.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
perhaps,
it
depends.
the
first,
it
would
have
between
two
years.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
there
might
be,
there
might
be
some
basis
for
challenging
the
validity
of
the
statement
and
in
the
pre-sentence
report
that
--
and
a
challenge
of
the
act
would
see
of
it.
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
that‘s
correct.
i
would
challenge
that
in
several
reasons,
why?
perhaps,
the
def
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
well,
perhaps
as
furman
challenge
is,
the
statement
is
that
not
being
a
fact.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
and
the
defendant
it
is
not
true.
he
has
been
in
prison
29
and
a
half
out
of
30
years.
he
is
entitled
i
would
think
to
a
hearing.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
to
determine
whether
that’s
true
or
not.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
the
hearing
might
be
to
if
there
was
been
a
mistake
in
the
report
or
there
has
been
the
male
identification
problem,
the
fingerprints
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
attack
the
fact,
the
factual
basis
of
the
finding.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
of
29
and
half
years?
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes,
he
attacks
that
finding
by
the
probation
department
is
not
being
true
or
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
perhaps.
i
don’t
know
whose
burden
it
would
be.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
well,
i
think
i
--
excuse
me.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
no,
i
think
the
way
i
read
the
entire
file
--
(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct,
without
any
statement.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct.
but
it
is
the
triggering
device
for
bringing
a
youth
offender
into
a
sentence
as
an
adult.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes
that
would
--
that
raises
an
issue
which
i
raised
in
seventh
circuit
and
which
has
been
uniformly
rejected
by
every
circuit
court
that’s
seen
it
to
date
as
far
as
i
know
and
that’s
that
there
is
only
one
kind
of
probation
under
the
act,
and
namely
that
the
youth
offender
is
placed
on
probation
he
is
automatically
under
the
act.
i
point
that
out
at
page
21
of
my
brief
and
the
footnote
that
that
issue
has
been
rejected.
if
that’s
a
correct
interpretation,
then
he
is
on
probation
and
under
the
act
now
in
which
case
the
issue
which
i
bring
to
you
is
not
here.
but
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
but
the
general
least
consensus
is
of
which
i
disagree
is
that
you
can
make
a
finding
of
no
benefit
and
go
to
an
adult
sentencing
proceeding
and
put
the
defendant
on
probation.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct,
and
that
sentencing
under
the
act
is
either
an
(a),
(b),
or
(c)
sentence;
either
probation,
commitment,
or
which
is
(c)
which
is
not
applicable
which
would
extended
commitment
and
without
the
finding
under
(d),
that’s
his
option
and
nothing
more.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
it
is
a
youth
--
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
it
is
probation
law
that
is
tailored
with
an
end
result.(voice
overlap)
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
well,
i
believe
probation
is
treatment.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
it
is,
since
it
is
not
a
serious
offense,
the
sentencing
judge
who
believes
the
youth
offender
should
be
given
probation
would
seem
to
me
should
be
by
congressional
mandate
entitled
to
have
his
conviction
light.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
that’s
correct.
my
time
is
up.
mr.
robert
h.
friebert
thank
you.
