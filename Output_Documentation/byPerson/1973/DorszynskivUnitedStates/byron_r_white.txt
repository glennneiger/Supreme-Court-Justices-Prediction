there
are
a
lot
of
pre-sentence
reports
that
are
not
so
barren?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
says
that
strictly
a
finding
of
fact
in
an
ordinary
trial
doesn’t
necessarily
have
to
refer
to
any
evidence
or
even
just
as
has
no
reasons?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
will
be
5021
i
believe
(b).
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
would
be
in
different
hands
during
probation?
justice
byron
r.
white
same
act
and
same
people?
justice
byron
r.
white
same
standards?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
also
insist
on
a
hearing
in
connection
with
the
determination?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
there
is
something
involve
here
other
than
an
ordinary
sentencing
procedure?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you
should
be
there
and
have
a
chance
to
cross
examining,
might
as
well
represent
some
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
--
you
would
think
he
would
not
be
permitted
to
rely
on
an
un-cross
examined
pre-sentence
report?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

but
if
there
were,
i
can
imagine
what's
your
--
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
interrupt
for
a
moment.
just
on
its
face,
subsection
(d)
seems
to
be
triggered
namely
the
necessity
for
a
finding.
it
seems
to
be
triggered
only
if
the
court
proceeds
under
(b)
or
(c)?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
this
defendant
was
put
on
probation?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
know
but
what’s
the
reference
to
(b)
and
(c)?
there
is
an
(a)
here
that
speaks
about
probation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
(b)
or
(c)
--
doesn't
seem
to
--
(d)
speaks
only
on
(b)
or
(c)?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
requires
some
other
lawsuit
but
not
this
one?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh
yes,
but
the
thing
the
(d)
speaks
about
is
treatment?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
treatments
under
(b)
or
(c)
and
you
don’t
ordinarily
think
of
this
probationary
period
under
the
same
probation
officers
as
an
adult
would
be
as
a
youth
offender
treatment.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
why
(d),
it
seems
to
me
speaks
of
treatment
and
speaks
of
(b)
or
(c).
this
probation
is
under
the
same
probation
officers
as
an
adult
would
be
under?
justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
same
conditions,
and
so
and
it
is
not
a
probation
that’s
tailored
to
anything
special
about
the
youth
offender
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
is
a
treatment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
it
is
not
use
offender
treatment.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
it
seems
to
me
that
early
terminates
like
it
--
i
just
don’t
understand
why
that
--
you
call
that
treatment?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
about
requiring
a
finding?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

haven’t
they
said
they
will
require
finding?
justice
byron

he
never
was
committed
to
the
attorney
general
for
that
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
was
just
put
in
the
jail?
justice
byron

white
is
this
what
the
pre-sentence
report
recommended
or
do
you
know?
justice
