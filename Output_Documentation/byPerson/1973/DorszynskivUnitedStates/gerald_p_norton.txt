mr.
gerald
p.
norton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
at
the
outset,
it
would
be
useful
to
focus
on
what
the
issues
before
the
court
are
today.
there
has
been
a
lot
of
discussion
about
the
nature
of
the
hearing
that
must
be
held
if
this
matter
goes
back
for
re-sentencing
whether
the
judge
would
reach
the
same
result
after
making
the
finding
and
statement
of
reasons
whether
that
would
be
subject
to
appellant
review.
the
original
issue
raised
by
the
petitioner
in
the
district
court
is
whether
he
could
have
been
sentenced
under
provisions
other
than
the
youth
corrections
act
where
the
trial
judge
had
not
made
an
explicit
finding
to
the
effect
that
he
would
not
derive
benefit
from
treatment
under
section
5010
(b)
or
(c)
of
the
youth
corrections
act.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
the
sequence
was
this.
the
us
attorney
mentioned
at
the
commencement
of
the
arraignment
that
the
case
was
one
to
which
the
act
might
be
applicable.
petitioner’s
original
attorney
requested
that
he
would
be
sentence
under
the
act
and
asked
for
probation
under
the
act.
the
judge,
when
he
impose
the
split
sentence
involving
probation
under
section
3651
of
title
18
did
not
make
any
reference
at
that
time
to
the
act.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
at
later
point,
when
the
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
correct.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
and
then
at
the
later
point
when
the
sentence
was
challenge,
he
ruled
that
he
disagreed
with
the
district
of
columbia
cases
that
said
that
there
had
to
be
an
explicit
finding
and
his
determination
that
petitioner
should
not
be
sentence
under
the
act
was
essentially
implicit
in
his
sentencing
him
as
an
adult
under
probation.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
right.
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
not
necessary
under
the
act
for
an
explicit
finding
in
the
words
of
5010
(d)
that
he
will
not
derive
benefit
from
treatment
to
be
made.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
yes
sir,
as
the
recess,
but
i
think
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
no,
no.
this
was
case
in
which
the
information
was
presented
at
the
time
of
arraignment
and
it
was
previously
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
correct.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
and
also
by
the
petitioner’s
own
attorney.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
correct,
no
dispute.
alright,
the
petitioner
has
referred
to
the
fact
that
he
was
not
advised
by
the
judge
at
the
time
of
sentencing
about
the
possibility
that
if
he
had
been
sentenced
to
treatment
under
5010
(b),
he
might
be
subject
to
commitment
for
up
to
four
to
six
years.
now,
if
he
had
in
fact
received
such
treatment,
he
might
have
an
issue,
but
he
did
not
and
that
is
not
an
issue
that
he
is
protruded
in
this
case.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
yes,
in
the
carter
case--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i’m
aware
of
that
and
the
question
there
was
really
twofold.
one
question
was
whether
the
defendant
had
been
informed
about
possibility
and
the
court
found
that
the
record
was
not
clear
and
they
sent
it
back
for
further
determination.
the
other
issue
was
it
is
rather
a
typical
case
in
that
art
of
a
litigation
under
the
youth
act
until
very
recently
presented
a
defendant
who
was
sentenced
under
the
youth
act
complaining
about
it,
saying
that
“i
should
have
been
sentence
under
the
adult
provisions
because
it
might
have
been
a
misdemeanor
as
in
this
case
subject
to
six
months
or
three
months
or
one
year
maximum
and
then,
they
were
subjected
to
a
longer
period.”
on
the
question
of
whether
an
explicit
finding
must
be
made,
let
me
correct
the
statement
of
what
the
government's
position
is.
we
do
not
in
our
brief
concede
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
impose
an
explicit
--
a
requirement
of
an
explicit
finding
as
petitioner
seeks
that
the
defendant
will
not
derive
benefit
under
the
full
treatment
under
the
act.
what
we
have
said
is
that,
if
the
court
were
to
require
that
there'd
be
some
indication
in
the
record
that
the
act
has
been
considered
as
there
is
in
this
case,
then
that
is
sufficient
and
we
would
not
oppose
that,
but
we
do
not
agree
that
there
should
necessarily
be
any
requirement
of
a
formal
finding
in
the
words
of
the
statute
or
in
any
other
particular
manner.
it
maybe
sufficient
if
the
pre-sentence
report
indicates
that
possibility
or
if
it
is
referred
to
by
counsel
or
the
judge
made
some
reference
to
it.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
yes.
it
was
--
the
preceding
occurred
and
that
was
taken
on
the
same
day,
the
arraignment
and
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
am
not
sure.
there
was
a
recess
while
he
studied
the
pre-sentence
report
and
i
am
just
not
sure
how.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
we
say
that
there
are
reasons
that
such
a
requirement
might
be
desirable
but
on
the
other
hand,
some
courts
have
noted
that
there
are
reasons
why
it
maybe
undesirable
for
the
court
to
state
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
just
as
show
in
many
other
instances
that
a
finding
has
been
made
where
is
a
precondition
to
further
action
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
it
is
implicit
in
the
alternative
action
taken
by
the
court.
judges
no
less
than
governmental
agencies
are
entitled
to
a
presumption
of
regularity
and
if
the
statute
would
have
be
construed
as
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
our
position
is
not
one
of
objection
to
such
a
requirement
necessarily.
the
position
that
we
have
asserted
here
is
that
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
the
statute
provides
that
the
judge
has
four
options
under
the
act,
and
it
is
our
position
that
congress
intended
and
this
is
amply
demonstrated
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
judges
who
proposed
the
act
that
the
judge
would
have
complete
discretion
in
determining
how
to
sentence
a
youth
offender,
and
that
the
use
of
the
word
find,
it
is
not
finding
incidentally,
it
is
find.
if
the
court
shall
find
that
the
defendant
will
not
derive
benefit
from
treatment
under
the
act
was
not
meant
to
circumscribe
in
any
rigid
fashion
the
discretion
of
the
sentencing
judge
that
he
had
the
same
discretion
that
he
has
or
had
prior
to
the
act
to
sentence
the
defendant.
the
legislative
history,
we
think
makes
that
abundantly
clear
and
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
some
length,
the
various
comments
of
the
sponsors.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
right,
but
i
was
speaking
only
to
the
statement
that
we
had
made
a
concession.
our
position
is
that
the
act
does
not
require
any
explicit
finding
on
the
record,
but
we
would
not
strongly
oppose
some
procedural
requirement
to
indicate
for
sure
just
as
a
prophylactic
measure
that
the
act
has
been
considered,
but
that
isn’t
the
heart
of
this
case.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
we
are
saying
that
in
some
cases,
it
might
be
necessary
to
spell
it
out
and
another
there
maybe
other
indications
in
the
record
that
would
make
an
explicit
finding
unnecessary.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
the
prosecutor
had
definitely
--
i
am
not
sure
whether
defense
counsel’s
reference
to
a
came
before
or
after
the
recess.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
correct.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
correct
and
that
was
after
the
recess,
the
recess
is
indicated
on
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
six
and
the
recess
is
indicated
at
page
11
and
then
the
sentencing
followed
immediately
thereafter.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
the
statement
was
that
the
petitioner
was
asked
if
he
was
aware
of
the
maximum
penalty
for
the
offense
and
he
stated
yes,
it
was
one
year
and
that
is
true.
the
maximum
penalty
provided
under
section
844
for
this
offense
is
one
year.
he
contended
at
a
later
point
that
his
guilty
plea
should
be
set
aside
because
he
was
not
then
informed
that
under
the
youth
corrections
act
had
he
been
sentenced
under
it
and
moved
imprisonment
for
one
year
under
that
penalty
provision,
he
might
have
been
subject
to
treatment
for
up
to
anywhere
from
four
to
six
years
where
--
maybe
a
short
of
period
of
time
but
that
is
the
outer
limits.
that
attack
on
his
plea
is
since
been
abandoned.
now,
i
like
to
turn
to
the
threshold
question
which
is
“does
the
youth
corrections
act
limit
or
restrict
the
discretion
of
sentencing
judges?”
as
i
indicated
earlier,
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
which
was
drafted
by
judges
and
supported
in
congress
by
judges
make
perfectly
clear
that
no
intention
to
restrict
the
ordinary
sentencing
the
discretion
of
judges
was
intended.
judge
laws
had
stated
for
example
that
it
would
be
purely
optional,
not
an
absolute
mandate,
the
judges
do
not
have
to
use
it
if
they
do
not
want
to.
judge
phillips
likewise
that
it
was
purely
optional
and
the
judge
would
have
absolute
discretion
in
sentencing.
similar
comments
abound
and
we
have
set
them
forth
in
our
brief
at
pages
16
to
24.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
correct
and
that
is
what
subjection
(d)
does,
it
provides
(voice
overlap)
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
true;
we
do
not
think
that
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
we
do
not
see
that
you
have
to
get
into
any
of
these
questions
at
all.
the
way
that
the
procedure
of
issues
raised
in
this
case
have
come
up
is
because
some
courts,
notably
the
district
of
columbia’s
circuit
have
read
the
act
differently
than
we
read
it.
they
say
that
as
petitioner
claims
here
that
it
constitutes
a
binding
mandate
to
the
district
judges
in
sentencing
youth
offenders.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that
is
our
position
basically
that
the
case
is
--
the
question
presented
is
one
of
whether
such
explicit
findings
are
required
and
whether
it
must
be
a
company
by
statement
of
reasons.
the
legislative
history
again
and
indeed
the
statute
itself
provides
absolutely
no
support
for
the
argument
that
this
statute
when
enacted
by
congress
in
1950
was
intended
to
impose
on
sentencing
judges
any
kind
of
procedural
requirements
at
all.
the
use
of
the
word
find
in
subsections
(b),
(c),
and
(d)
is
not
equivalent
to
the
use
of
the
word
findings
in
statute
pretending
to
administrative
agency
or
even
in
the
provisions
of
the
rules
of
procedure
that
say
a
judge
must
make
findings
of
fact.
it
is
essentially
the
same
as
saying
“if
the
judge
concludes
that
he
is
of
the
opinion
or
believes
that
such
and
such
is
the
case
then
it
may
do
this.”
and
again
the
use
of
the
word
“may”
is
crucial
here.
all
of
the
options
outlined
in
section
5010
have
the
word
“may”
in
them.
the
judge
may
do
this,
he
may
do
that,
he
may
do
a
third
thing.
it
is
not
like
some
sentencing
statutes
which
have
a
clearly
mandatory
requirement.
for
example
in
the
narcotics
addicts
rehabilitation
statute
which
this
court
considered
in
the
marshall
case;
there
if
the
judge
first
takes
the
discretionary
step
of
having
a
defendant
who
believes
maybe
an
addict
committed
for
treatment
and
gets
a
report
on
whether
he
might
be
subject
to
rehabilitation
then
if
the
court
determines
that
he
is
an
addict
and
he
might
benefit
from
treatment
for
rehabilitation,
then
he
shall
sentence
him
for
treatment.
he
has
no
discretion.
it
is
sharp
contrast
to
this
statute
which
leaves
all
of
these
options
open
to
the
judges’
discretion.
as
i
say
the
dc
circuit
has
gone
off
on
a
different
premise
and
from
that
premise
has
said
that
all
of
these
procedural
requirements
of
explicit
findings,
statement
of
reasons,
and
appellate
review
are
essentially
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
no
the
dc.
circuit
cases
have
all
--
the
recent
ones
have
all
involved
adult
sentences.
most
of
them
have
been
robbery
or
murder
cases.
the
defendant
was
sentenced
as
an
adult
and
appealed
either
maybe
on
a
guilty
plea
so
the
sentence
may
have
been
only
issue
before
the
court
and
the
court
in
the
series
of
decisions
has
elaborated
a
series
of
rules
which
now
require
that
before
a
youth
offender,
that's
anyone
under
22
maybe
sentenced
as
an
adult
or
under
any
other
applicable
penalty
provisions,
the
district
judge
has
to
make
an
explicit
finding
that
the
will
not
derive
benefit
from
treatment
under
the
act.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
right.
they
have
read
the
statue
as
a
mandating
preferential
sentencing
under
the
youth
offender
statute.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
the
basic
conflict
between
the
court
below
and
the
dc
circuit.
they
do
not
--
the
dc
circuit
which
is
recently
joined
by
on
a
perspective
basis
only
be
the
second
circuit,
they
do
not
suggest
that
the
procedural
requirements
are
called
for
by
the
statute
itself.
there
is
simply
no
language
that
they
could
base
any
argument
like
that
on.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
do
not
know
their
current
status.
it
probably
would
not
have
been
decided
by
now
since
in
january
only.
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
has
said
is
that
you
cannot
sentence
someone
other
than
under
the
act
unless
you
find
that
he
is
so
incorrigible
that
he
will
not
derive
benefit
and
then,
in
order
to
implement
that
mandate,
they
say
that
these
other
procedures
follow.
now,
the
drafters
of
the
statute
in
1950,
i
am
sure
nothing
could
have
been
further
from
their
mind
than
that
in
enacting
the
youth
corrections
act,
they
were
imposing
on
sentencing
judges
an
elaborate
structure
of
required
findings
and
statements
of
reasons
and
now
appellate
review
which
in
the
district
of
columbia
has
become
very
substantial.
it
is
very
difficult
for
an
adult
conviction
to
withstand
the
kind
of
analysis
that
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
now,
this
is
in
the
us
court
of
appeals.
recently,
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
decided
that
in
the
reed
case
in
december,
chief
judge
green
said
that
they
would
no
longer
adhere
of
the
dc
circuits
rule
as
to
appellate
review.
so,
that
is
only
in
the
us
court
of
appeals,
but
the
second
circuit
has
joined
the
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well
in
that
same
case
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
in
the
same
case,
the
reed
case
that
judge
riley’s
opinion
said
that
in
some
cases,
it
may
not
be
necessary
for
the
judge
to
make
an
explicit
finding.
if
for
example,
he
is
called
for
a
discretionary
report
concerning
how
to
treat
the
defendant
or
how
to
dispose
off
the
case
and
if
that
report
under
5010
(e)
recommends
an
adult
sentence
because
the
defendant
would
not
benefit,
then
in
the
case
like
that,
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
judge
to
reiterate
that
and
he
express
some
reasons
why
it
might
be
detrimental
if
that
were
required.
he
pointed
out
that
by
not
sentencing
under
the
youth
act,
the
judge
does
not
turn
his
back
on
rehabilitation.
that
is
a
goal
of
all
correctional
institutions.
it
is
a
particular
emphasis
in
the
youth
corrections
system
but
it
is
also
a
goal
in
other
institution,
so
that
you
would
deserve
the
potential
for
rehabilitation
if
you
were
to
at
the
time
of
sentencing
in
effect
hit
the
defendant
over
the
head
with
the
judicial
pronouncement
that
you
will
not
derive
any
benefit
from
rehabilitative
treatment.
so
that
they
have
to
a
limited
extent
departed
in
that
respect
from
the
dc
circuit
rule.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
essentially
no
and
that
this
is
a
fundamental
distinction
between
this
case
and
say
the
spectre
case.
in
any
sentencing
situation,
the
judge
has
to
consider
the
potential
for
rehabilitation
of
the
defendant
because
probation
unless
it
is
a
case
where
there
are
limitations,
but
in
the
main
probation
is
one
possibility,
early
release,
early
parole.
the
elements
that
the
judge
takes
into
account
are
very
similar
so
that
you
are
not
in
this
statutory
scheme
calling
upon
the
judge
to
consider
factors
that
he
would
not
ordinarily
consider
in
sentencing
an
adult.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
certainly
true.
let
me
point
out
something
else
that
stems
from
the
dc
circuit
reading
of
the
statute
which
petitioner
supports.
if
the
statute
were
to
be
construed
as
giving
the
judge
discretion
to
choose
between
the
youth
act
and
other
applicable
provisions,
only
in
the
case
where
he
finds
the
defendant
is
incorrigible
and
will
not
derive
benefit
then
on
one
hand
you
have
an
absurd
result
because
only
if
you
have
someone
who
is
incorrigible,
there
is
a
judge
have
to
choice
to
as
between
youth
act
treatment
and
the
other
possibilities.
but
in
addition,
you
unduly
limit
the
judges'
flexibility
because
there
maybe
other
provisions
which
would
be
even
more
beneficial
to
the
defendant
than
youth
act
treatment
and
this
may
well
be
such
a
case.
this
may
be
precisely
what
the
judge
had
in
mind.
youth
act
treatment
involves
a
possibility
of
commitment
and
restriction
on
liberty
for
up
to
six
years.
this
defendant
the
petitioner
received
a
90-day
commitment
to
a
jail
type
institution.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
for
that
purpose,
no
and
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
right.
the
sentence
was
explicit.
this
is
under
3651
title
18
followed
by
probation
which
had
in
received
the
youth
act
sentence,
he
would
not
have
had
the
same
assurance
and
the
judge
would
not
have
had
the
same
assurance
that
after
a
dose
of
custody,
he
would
be
free.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
do
not
know.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
am
not
able
to
answer.
i
have
not
seen
it.
and
let
me
mention
one
other
alternative
that
is
particular
application
in
this
case.
under
844
title
21,
the
statute
under
which
the
petitioner
was
convicted,
the
judge
has
the
discretion.
this
is
a
case
of
a
simple
possession,
a
first
time
offender
for
controlled
substance.
the
judge
has
the
discretion
to
sentence
the
defendant
to
probation
for
up
to
one
year
and
if
the
defendant
satisfactorily
completes
that
probation,
then
he
is
automatically
entitled
to
have
the
proceeding
set
aside
and
completely
expunged
for
all
purposes,
a
far
and
more
comprehensive
relief
then
is
available
under
the
youth
corrections
act
and
it
is
mandatory.
in
the
present
case,
let
us
take
petitioner’s
scenario.
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
and
send
it
back
for
re-sentencing,
if
he
was
sentenced
under
the
youth
corrections
act,
and
if
he
received
probation
and
we
do
not
necessarily
agree
that
that
is
the
only
alternative
on
remand,
but
if
he
did
receive
such
probation,
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
have
his
conviction
set
aside
upon
the
completion
of
that
probation.
the
only
time
he
can
have
it
set
aside
is
if
the
judge
in
the
court
and
its
discretion
decides
to
discharge
him
from
probation
prior
to
the
term
set.
it
is
only
for
premature
or
early
release
that
this
remedy
is
available.
so,
it
is
not
mandatory
as
it
would
have
been
under
844.
yet
under
the
petitioner's
own
argument,
the
district
court
would
have
been
disabled
from
sentencing
him
under
844
unless
he
first
concluded
that
he
was
incorrigible
or
will
not
derive
benefit
from
treatment
under
(b)
or
(c).
now,
he
might
well
have
thought
that
maybe
he
will
derive
some
benefit
but
it
is
not
worth
subjecting
him
to
the
added
risks
of
extended
incarceration
that
would
be
involved.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
am
not
sure
about
the
prior
(voice
overlap)
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
would
be
my
reading
of
the
situation.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
right
and
two
more
years
of
probation,
he
would
--
after
two
years
of
probation,
he
would
be
out
college
and
so.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
it
is
--
first
of
all,
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
expungement
as
such
under
the
provisions
of
the
youth
act
unless
he
were
discharged
from
probation
or
released
from
commitment
prior
to
the
term
that's
set.
so,
it
really
matter
of
speculation
whether
that
situation
would
over
arise
were
he
sentenced
under
the
act.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
i
think
--
that
is
a
question
to
which
i
am
not
prepared
to
answer.
the
words
of
section
5021
which
provide
for
expungement
are
simply
refer
to
youth
offender
who
has
been
on
probation.
and
the
structure
of
the
act,
it
appears
to
refer
to
probation
under
5010
(a).
explicitly,
it
is
not
limited
to
that
and
whether
it
would
refer
to
probation
under
3651
which
the
petitioner
received
is
an
open
question
which
are
not
this
court
certainly
has
not
resolved.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
but
i
am
not
sure
that
there
is
any
case
that
what
has
been
sought
and
denied.
i
think
some
cases
have
assumed
that
5010
--
that
adult
probation
in
not
subject
to
the
expungement
provision,
but
i
am
not
sure
that
there
is
any
clear
ruling
on
that
one.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
at
the
outset,
it
would
be
useful
to
focus
on
what
the
issues
before
the
court
are
today.
there
has
been
a
lot
of
discussion
about
the
nature
of
the
hearing
that
must
be
held
if
this
matter
goes
back
for
re-sentencing
whether
the
judge
would
reach
the
same
result
after
making
the
finding
and
statement
of
reasons
whether
that
would
be
subject
to
appellant
review.
the
original
issue
raised
by
the
petitioner
in
the
district
court
is
whether
he
could
have
been
sentenced
under
provisions
other
than
the
youth
corrections
act
where
the
trial
judge
had
not
made
an
explicit
finding
to
the
effect
that
he
would
not
derive
benefit
from
treatment
under
section
5010
(b)
or
(c)
of
the
youth
corrections
act.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
the
sequence
was
this.
the
us
attorney
mentioned
at
the
commencement
of
the
arraignment
that
the
case
was
one
to
which
the
act
might
be
applicable.
petitioner’s
original
attorney
requested
that
he
would
be
sentence
under
the
act
and
asked
for
probation
under
the
act.
the
judge,
when
he
impose
the
split
sentence
involving
probation
under
section
3651
of
title
18
did
not
make
any
reference
at
that
time
to
the
act.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
at
later
point,
when
the
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
correct.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
and
then
at
the
later
point
when
the
sentence
was
challenge,
he
ruled
that
he
disagreed
with
the
district
of
columbia
cases
that
said
that
there
had
to
be
an
explicit
finding
and
his
determination
that
petitioner
should
not
be
sentence
under
the
act
was
essentially
implicit
in
his
sentencing
him
as
an
adult
under
probation.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
right.
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
not
necessary
under
the
act
for
an
explicit
finding
in
the
words
of
5010
(d)
that
he
will
not
derive
benefit
from
treatment
to
be
made.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
yes
sir,
as
the
recess,
but
i
think
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
no,
no.
this
was
case
in
which
the
information
was
presented
at
the
time
of
arraignment
and
it
was
previously
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
correct.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
and
also
by
the
petitioner’s
own
attorney.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
correct,
no
dispute.
alright,
the
petitioner
has
referred
to
the
fact
that
he
was
not
advised
by
the
judge
at
the
time
of
sentencing
about
the
possibility
that
if
he
had
been
sentenced
to
treatment
under
5010
(b),
he
might
be
subject
to
commitment
for
up
to
four
to
six
years.
now,
if
he
had
in
fact
received
such
treatment,
he
might
have
an
issue,
but
he
did
not
and
that
is
not
an
issue
that
he
is
protruded
in
this
case.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
yes,
in
the
carter
case--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i’m
aware
of
that
and
the
question
there
was
really
twofold.
one
question
was
whether
the
defendant
had
been
informed
about
possibility
and
the
court
found
that
the
record
was
not
clear
and
they
sent
it
back
for
further
determination.
the
other
issue
was
it
is
rather
a
typical
case
in
that
art
of
a
litigation
under
the
youth
act
until
very
recently
presented
a
defendant
who
was
sentenced
under
the
youth
act
complaining
about
it,
saying
that
“i
should
have
been
sentence
under
the
adult
provisions
because
it
might
have
been
a
misdemeanor
as
in
this
case
subject
to
six
months
or
three
months
or
one
year
maximum
and
then,
they
were
subjected
to
a
longer
period.”
on
the
question
of
whether
an
explicit
finding
must
be
made,
let
me
correct
the
statement
of
what
the
government's
position
is.
we
do
not
in
our
brief
concede
that
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
impose
an
explicit
--
a
requirement
of
an
explicit
finding
as
petitioner
seeks
that
the
defendant
will
not
derive
benefit
under
the
full
treatment
under
the
act.
what
we
have
said
is
that,
if
the
court
were
to
require
that
there'd
be
some
indication
in
the
record
that
the
act
has
been
considered
as
there
is
in
this
case,
then
that
is
sufficient
and
we
would
not
oppose
that,
but
we
do
not
agree
that
there
should
necessarily
be
any
requirement
of
a
formal
finding
in
the
words
of
the
statute
or
in
any
other
particular
manner.
it
maybe
sufficient
if
the
pre-sentence
report
indicates
that
possibility
or
if
it
is
referred
to
by
counsel
or
the
judge
made
some
reference
to
it.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
yes.
it
was
--
the
preceding
occurred
and
that
was
taken
on
the
same
day,
the
arraignment
and
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
am
not
sure.
there
was
a
recess
while
he
studied
the
pre-sentence
report
and
i
am
just
not
sure
how.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
we
say
that
there
are
reasons
that
such
a
requirement
might
be
desirable
but
on
the
other
hand,
some
courts
have
noted
that
there
are
reasons
why
it
maybe
undesirable
for
the
court
to
state
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
just
as
show
in
many
other
instances
that
a
finding
has
been
made
where
is
a
precondition
to
further
action
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
it
is
implicit
in
the
alternative
action
taken
by
the
court.
judges
no
less
than
governmental
agencies
are
entitled
to
a
presumption
of
regularity
and
if
the
statute
would
have
be
construed
as
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
our
position
is
not
one
of
objection
to
such
a
requirement
necessarily.
the
position
that
we
have
asserted
here
is
that
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
the
statute
provides
that
the
judge
has
four
options
under
the
act,
and
it
is
our
position
that
congress
intended
and
this
is
amply
demonstrated
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
judges
who
proposed
the
act
that
the
judge
would
have
complete
discretion
in
determining
how
to
sentence
a
youth
offender,
and
that
the
use
of
the
word
find,
it
is
not
finding
incidentally,
it
is
find.
if
the
court
shall
find
that
the
defendant
will
not
derive
benefit
from
treatment
under
the
act
was
not
meant
to
circumscribe
in
any
rigid
fashion
the
discretion
of
the
sentencing
judge
that
he
had
the
same
discretion
that
he
has
or
had
prior
to
the
act
to
sentence
the
defendant.
the
legislative
history,
we
think
makes
that
abundantly
clear
and
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
some
length,
the
various
comments
of
the
sponsors.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
right,
but
i
was
speaking
only
to
the
statement
that
we
had
made
a
concession.
our
position
is
that
the
act
does
not
require
any
explicit
finding
on
the
record,
but
we
would
not
strongly
oppose
some
procedural
requirement
to
indicate
for
sure
just
as
a
prophylactic
measure
that
the
act
has
been
considered,
but
that
isn’t
the
heart
of
this
case.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
we
are
saying
that
in
some
cases,
it
might
be
necessary
to
spell
it
out
and
another
there
maybe
other
indications
in
the
record
that
would
make
an
explicit
finding
unnecessary.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
the
prosecutor
had
definitely
--
i
am
not
sure
whether
defense
counsel’s
reference
to
a
came
before
or
after
the
recess.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that’s
correct.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
correct
and
that
was
after
the
recess,
the
recess
is
indicated
on
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
six
and
the
recess
is
indicated
at
page
11
and
then
the
sentencing
followed
immediately
thereafter.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
the
statement
was
that
the
petitioner
was
asked
if
he
was
aware
of
the
maximum
penalty
for
the
offense
and
he
stated
yes,
it
was
one
year
and
that
is
true.
the
maximum
penalty
provided
under
section
844
for
this
offense
is
one
year.
he
contended
at
a
later
point
that
his
guilty
plea
should
be
set
aside
because
he
was
not
then
informed
that
under
the
youth
corrections
act
had
he
been
sentenced
under
it
and
moved
imprisonment
for
one
year
under
that
penalty
provision,
he
might
have
been
subject
to
treatment
for
up
to
anywhere
from
four
to
six
years
where
--
maybe
a
short
of
period
of
time
but
that
is
the
outer
limits.
that
attack
on
his
plea
is
since
been
abandoned.
now,
i
like
to
turn
to
the
threshold
question
which
is
“does
the
youth
corrections
act
limit
or
restrict
the
discretion
of
sentencing
judges?”
as
i
indicated
earlier,
the
legislative
history
of
this
act
which
was
drafted
by
judges
and
supported
in
congress
by
judges
make
perfectly
clear
that
no
intention
to
restrict
the
ordinary
sentencing
the
discretion
of
judges
was
intended.
judge
laws
had
stated
for
example
that
it
would
be
purely
optional,
not
an
absolute
mandate,
the
judges
do
not
have
to
use
it
if
they
do
not
want
to.
judge
phillips
likewise
that
it
was
purely
optional
and
the
judge
would
have
absolute
discretion
in
sentencing.
similar
comments
abound
and
we
have
set
them
forth
in
our
brief
at
pages
16
to
24.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
correct
and
that
is
what
subjection
(d)
does,
it
provides
(voice
overlap)
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
true;
we
do
not
think
that
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
we
do
not
see
that
you
have
to
get
into
any
of
these
questions
at
all.
the
way
that
the
procedure
of
issues
raised
in
this
case
have
come
up
is
because
some
courts,
notably
the
district
of
columbia’s
circuit
have
read
the
act
differently
than
we
read
it.
they
say
that
as
petitioner
claims
here
that
it
constitutes
a
binding
mandate
to
the
district
judges
in
sentencing
youth
offenders.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
that
is
our
position
basically
that
the
case
is
--
the
question
presented
is
one
of
whether
such
explicit
findings
are
required
and
whether
it
must
be
a
company
by
statement
of
reasons.
the
legislative
history
again
and
indeed
the
statute
itself
provides
absolutely
no
support
for
the
argument
that
this
statute
when
enacted
by
congress
in
1950
was
intended
to
impose
on
sentencing
judges
any
kind
of
procedural
requirements
at
all.
the
use
of
the
word
find
in
subsections
(b),
(c),
and
(d)
is
not
equivalent
to
the
use
of
the
word
findings
in
statute
pretending
to
administrative
agency
or
even
in
the
provisions
of
the
rules
of
procedure
that
say
a
judge
must
make
findings
of
fact.
it
is
essentially
the
same
as
saying
“if
the
judge
concludes
that
he
is
of
the
opinion
or
believes
that
such
and
such
is
the
case
then
it
may
do
this.”
and
again
the
use
of
the
word
“may”
is
crucial
here.
all
of
the
options
outlined
in
section
5010
have
the
word
“may”
in
them.
the
judge
may
do
this,
he
may
do
that,
he
may
do
a
third
thing.
it
is
not
like
some
sentencing
statutes
which
have
a
clearly
mandatory
requirement.
for
example
in
the
narcotics
addicts
rehabilitation
statute
which
this
court
considered
in
the
marshall
case;
there
if
the
judge
first
takes
the
discretionary
step
of
having
a
defendant
who
believes
maybe
an
addict
committed
for
treatment
and
gets
a
report
on
whether
he
might
be
subject
to
rehabilitation
then
if
the
court
determines
that
he
is
an
addict
and
he
might
benefit
from
treatment
for
rehabilitation,
then
he
shall
sentence
him
for
treatment.
he
has
no
discretion.
it
is
sharp
contrast
to
this
statute
which
leaves
all
of
these
options
open
to
the
judges’
discretion.
as
i
say
the
dc
circuit
has
gone
off
on
a
different
premise
and
from
that
premise
has
said
that
all
of
these
procedural
requirements
of
explicit
findings,
statement
of
reasons,
and
appellate
review
are
essentially
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
no
the
dc.
circuit
cases
have
all
--
the
recent
ones
have
all
involved
adult
sentences.
most
of
them
have
been
robbery
or
murder
cases.
the
defendant
was
sentenced
as
an
adult
and
appealed
either
maybe
on
a
guilty
plea
so
the
sentence
may
have
been
only
issue
before
the
court
and
the
court
in
the
series
of
decisions
has
elaborated
a
series
of
rules
which
now
require
that
before
a
youth
offender,
that's
anyone
under
22
maybe
sentenced
as
an
adult
or
under
any
other
applicable
penalty
provisions,
the
district
judge
has
to
make
an
explicit
finding
that
the
will
not
derive
benefit
from
treatment
under
the
act.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
right.
they
have
read
the
statue
as
a
mandating
preferential
sentencing
under
the
youth
offender
statute.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
the
basic
conflict
between
the
court
below
and
the
dc
circuit.
they
do
not
--
the
dc
circuit
which
is
recently
joined
by
on
a
perspective
basis
only
be
the
second
circuit,
they
do
not
suggest
that
the
procedural
requirements
are
called
for
by
the
statute
itself.
there
is
simply
no
language
that
they
could
base
any
argument
like
that
on.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
do
not
know
their
current
status.
it
probably
would
not
have
been
decided
by
now
since
in
january
only.
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
has
said
is
that
you
cannot
sentence
someone
other
than
under
the
act
unless
you
find
that
he
is
so
incorrigible
that
he
will
not
derive
benefit
and
then,
in
order
to
implement
that
mandate,
they
say
that
these
other
procedures
follow.
now,
the
drafters
of
the
statute
in
1950,
i
am
sure
nothing
could
have
been
further
from
their
mind
than
that
in
enacting
the
youth
corrections
act,
they
were
imposing
on
sentencing
judges
an
elaborate
structure
of
required
findings
and
statements
of
reasons
and
now
appellate
review
which
in
the
district
of
columbia
has
become
very
substantial.
it
is
very
difficult
for
an
adult
conviction
to
withstand
the
kind
of
analysis
that
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
now,
this
is
in
the
us
court
of
appeals.
recently,
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
decided
that
in
the
reed
case
in
december,
chief
judge
green
said
that
they
would
no
longer
adhere
of
the
dc
circuits
rule
as
to
appellate
review.
so,
that
is
only
in
the
us
court
of
appeals,
but
the
second
circuit
has
joined
the
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well
in
that
same
case
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
in
the
same
case,
the
reed
case
that
judge
riley’s
opinion
said
that
in
some
cases,
it
may
not
be
necessary
for
the
judge
to
make
an
explicit
finding.
if
for
example,
he
is
called
for
a
discretionary
report
concerning
how
to
treat
the
defendant
or
how
to
dispose
off
the
case
and
if
that
report
under
5010
(e)
recommends
an
adult
sentence
because
the
defendant
would
not
benefit,
then
in
the
case
like
that,
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
judge
to
reiterate
that
and
he
express
some
reasons
why
it
might
be
detrimental
if
that
were
required.
he
pointed
out
that
by
not
sentencing
under
the
youth
act,
the
judge
does
not
turn
his
back
on
rehabilitation.
that
is
a
goal
of
all
correctional
institutions.
it
is
a
particular
emphasis
in
the
youth
corrections
system
but
it
is
also
a
goal
in
other
institution,
so
that
you
would
deserve
the
potential
for
rehabilitation
if
you
were
to
at
the
time
of
sentencing
in
effect
hit
the
defendant
over
the
head
with
the
judicial
pronouncement
that
you
will
not
derive
any
benefit
from
rehabilitative
treatment.
so
that
they
have
to
a
limited
extent
departed
in
that
respect
from
the
dc
circuit
rule.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
essentially
no
and
that
this
is
a
fundamental
distinction
between
this
case
and
say
the
spectre
case.
in
any
sentencing
situation,
the
judge
has
to
consider
the
potential
for
rehabilitation
of
the
defendant
because
probation
unless
it
is
a
case
where
there
are
limitations,
but
in
the
main
probation
is
one
possibility,
early
release,
early
parole.
the
elements
that
the
judge
takes
into
account
are
very
similar
so
that
you
are
not
in
this
statutory
scheme
calling
upon
the
judge
to
consider
factors
that
he
would
not
ordinarily
consider
in
sentencing
an
adult.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
certainly
true.
let
me
point
out
something
else
that
stems
from
the
dc
circuit
reading
of
the
statute
which
petitioner
supports.
if
the
statute
were
to
be
construed
as
giving
the
judge
discretion
to
choose
between
the
youth
act
and
other
applicable
provisions,
only
in
the
case
where
he
finds
the
defendant
is
incorrigible
and
will
not
derive
benefit
then
on
one
hand
you
have
an
absurd
result
because
only
if
you
have
someone
who
is
incorrigible,
there
is
a
judge
have
to
choice
to
as
between
youth
act
treatment
and
the
other
possibilities.
but
in
addition,
you
unduly
limit
the
judges'
flexibility
because
there
maybe
other
provisions
which
would
be
even
more
beneficial
to
the
defendant
than
youth
act
treatment
and
this
may
well
be
such
a
case.
this
may
be
precisely
what
the
judge
had
in
mind.
youth
act
treatment
involves
a
possibility
of
commitment
and
restriction
on
liberty
for
up
to
six
years.
this
defendant
the
petitioner
received
a
90-day
commitment
to
a
jail
type
institution.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
for
that
purpose,
no
and
--
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
right.
the
sentence
was
explicit.
this
is
under
3651
title
18
followed
by
probation
which
had
in
received
the
youth
act
sentence,
he
would
not
have
had
the
same
assurance
and
the
judge
would
not
have
had
the
same
assurance
that
after
a
dose
of
custody,
he
would
be
free.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
do
not
know.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
am
not
able
to
answer.
i
have
not
seen
it.
and
let
me
mention
one
other
alternative
that
is
particular
application
in
this
case.
under
844
title
21,
the
statute
under
which
the
petitioner
was
convicted,
the
judge
has
the
discretion.
this
is
a
case
of
a
simple
possession,
a
first
time
offender
for
controlled
substance.
the
judge
has
the
discretion
to
sentence
the
defendant
to
probation
for
up
to
one
year
and
if
the
defendant
satisfactorily
completes
that
probation,
then
he
is
automatically
entitled
to
have
the
proceeding
set
aside
and
completely
expunged
for
all
purposes,
a
far
and
more
comprehensive
relief
then
is
available
under
the
youth
corrections
act
and
it
is
mandatory.
in
the
present
case,
let
us
take
petitioner’s
scenario.
if
this
court
were
to
reverse
and
send
it
back
for
re-sentencing,
if
he
was
sentenced
under
the
youth
corrections
act,
and
if
he
received
probation
and
we
do
not
necessarily
agree
that
that
is
the
only
alternative
on
remand,
but
if
he
did
receive
such
probation,
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
have
his
conviction
set
aside
upon
the
completion
of
that
probation.
the
only
time
he
can
have
it
set
aside
is
if
the
judge
in
the
court
and
its
discretion
decides
to
discharge
him
from
probation
prior
to
the
term
set.
it
is
only
for
premature
or
early
release
that
this
remedy
is
available.
so,
it
is
not
mandatory
as
it
would
have
been
under
844.
yet
under
the
petitioner's
own
argument,
the
district
court
would
have
been
disabled
from
sentencing
him
under
844
unless
he
first
concluded
that
he
was
incorrigible
or
will
not
derive
benefit
from
treatment
under
(b)
or
(c).
now,
he
might
well
have
thought
that
maybe
he
will
derive
some
benefit
but
it
is
not
worth
subjecting
him
to
the
added
risks
of
extended
incarceration
that
would
be
involved.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
i
am
not
sure
about
the
prior
(voice
overlap)
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
would
be
my
reading
of
the
situation.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
that
is
right
and
two
more
years
of
probation,
he
would
--
after
two
years
of
probation,
he
would
be
out
college
and
so.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
it
is
--
first
of
all,
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
expungement
as
such
under
the
provisions
of
the
youth
act
unless
he
were
discharged
from
probation
or
released
from
commitment
prior
to
the
term
that's
set.
so,
it
really
matter
of
speculation
whether
that
situation
would
over
arise
were
he
sentenced
under
the
act.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
well,
i
think
--
that
is
a
question
to
which
i
am
not
prepared
to
answer.
the
words
of
section
5021
which
provide
for
expungement
are
simply
refer
to
youth
offender
who
has
been
on
probation.
and
the
structure
of
the
act,
it
appears
to
refer
to
probation
under
5010
(a).
explicitly,
it
is
not
limited
to
that
and
whether
it
would
refer
to
probation
under
3651
which
the
petitioner
received
is
an
open
question
which
are
not
this
court
certainly
has
not
resolved.
mr.
gerald
p.
norton
but
i
am
not
sure
that
there
is
any
case
that
what
has
been
sought
and
denied.
i
think
some
cases
have
assumed
that
5010
--
that
adult
probation
in
not
subject
to
the
expungement
provision,
but
i
am
not
sure
that
there
is
any
clear
ruling
on
that
one.
