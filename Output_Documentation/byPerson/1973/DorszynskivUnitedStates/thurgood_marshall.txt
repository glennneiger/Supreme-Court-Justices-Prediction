be
automatic?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
wouldn’t
be
automatic.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
have
another
problem.
what
--
you
are
going
to
use
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
what’s
you
going
to
use
as
your
standard?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
personally
don’t
see
why
findings
means
hearing.
i
think
you
make
findings
without
a
hearing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
i
would
say
a
pre-sentence
report
which
shows
that
in
the
30
years
of
this
man
adult
life
he
had
been
jailed
29
years
and
a
half.
i
don’t
think
i
would
have
to
need
a
hearing
to
make
findings,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
have
any
--
i
am
saying
that
this
is
a
pre-sentence
report
and
it
says
what
i
said,
29
and
a
half
of
his
30
years,
he
has
been
in
jail.
and
you
say
that
is
not
enough
by
itself
standing
as
it
is
alone
for
the
judge
to
make
a
finding
that
this
man
is
unfit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
perhaps
with
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
there
was
nothing
else
there
but
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
would
the
hearing
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
would
the
hearing
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
all
you
can
do
would
be
to
attack
the
finding?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
finding
is
a
fact?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
burden
in
that,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
give
up,
you
will
agree
on
something
one
of
these
days
without
perhaps
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
showing
in
the
record
that
on
the
day
of
sentence,
the
judge
did
or
did
not
consider
this
on
that
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
time
spent
was
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
still
have
great
problem
as
to
whether
he
--
i
mean,
apart
the
one
we
assume
he
did,
but
wouldn’t
it
be
better
if
the
record
showed
that
i
have
considered
this
in
and
are
find
that
this
man
does
not
qualified
for
it
and
therefore,
i
am
not
going
to
give
it
to
him.
just
one
little
sentence.
you
don’t
want
to
agree
to
that
much?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
do
you
show
that
he
made
this
finding?
how
do
you
show
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
like
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
we
overdo
that
presumption
of
the
regularity
in
criminal
cases
brought
up
in
fifth
amendment.
we
look
at
it
everyday
and
examine
it
as
to
whether
what
it's
right
or
wrong.
why
do
you
object
to
the
requirement
of
judges
to
say,
i
find
that
this
man
is
not
entitled
to
it.
why
do
you
object
to
that
requirement?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
object
to
it
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
what
is
the
government
position
as
to
whether
or
not
the
judge
should
make
a
“finding?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
your
answer
is
not
required
to
make
a
finding?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
chances
do
i
get?
you
said
that
you
did
not
think
he
had
to
make
a
finding
and
now
you
say
he
should?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
do
about
the
expunging
his
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
have
no
of
any
case
where
it
was
done,
i
am
sure?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
are
whole
lot
of
cases
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice

be
automatic?
justice
thurgood

that
wouldn’t
be

justice
thurgood
