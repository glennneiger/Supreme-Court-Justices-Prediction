justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
it
goes
back
for
re-sentencing
under
the
youth
corrections
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
kind
of
sentence
may
the
judge
impose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
he
had
--
i
gather,
your
position
isn’t
merely
because
of
his
age
that
he
district
judge
had
first
to
determine
that
the
youth
corrections
act
was
inapplicable,
you
don’t
say
that,
do
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
you
say
then
is
that
on
the
plea
being
entered,
the
judge
had
initially
to
determine
whether
he
should
apply
the
youth
corrections
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that’s
the
six
years
you
are
talking
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
then
i
gather
the
argument
of
counsel
would
have
been,
had
the
judge
considered
and
decided
to
sentence
under
the
youth
corrections
act?
counsel
would
what,
have
argued
at
nothing
but
probation
for
this
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it’s
up
to
the
district
judge
to
decide
whether
he
should
sentence
under
the
youth
corrections
act
after
making
a
determination
of
benefit
and
so
forth
if
he
does
and
i
gather
that
the
defendant
having
pleaded
guilty,
he
cannot
control
what
the
judge
does
in
that
respect,
can
he?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
that
if
he
decides
that
it
would
be
benefit
of
the
defendant
by
sentencing
under
the
act,
then
he
must
sentence
under
the
act,
he
has
no
option
then
to
sentence
as
an
adult?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
with
reasons?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
indicate
that’s
what
the
congress
intended?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
gather
though
mr.
friebert,
this
is
because
and
i
now
understand
you,
you
derive
this
out
of
a
paragraph
(d).
your
position
is
that
there
must
be
a
sentence
under
the
youth
corrections
act
unless
a
finding
that
the
offender
will
not
derive
benefit
under
(d)
is
made,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
so
your
basic
proposition
is
that
there
must
be
a
sentence
under
youth
correction,
unless
this
finding
is
made
and
there
must
be
a
record
in
a
form
of
a
finding
supported
by
reasons?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
order
that
on
judicial
review,
if
the
sentence
is
under
some
other
penalty
provision,
it
can
be
said
whether
the
sentencing
judge
erred
on
that,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
what
different
position
would
he
be
and
then
he
is
now
that’s
what
all
we
have.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
he
had
been
if
depends?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
prevail
and
this
case
goes
back,
what's
to
stop
the
district
judge
then
from
considering
whether
he
derived
benefit
and
arriving
at
conclusions
with
reasons
or
that
he
wouldn't
and
then
things
stay
just
as
they
are,
don’t
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
then
have
another
review?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
unless
it
is
only
earlier
as
you
now
see
it,
(d),
initially
the
trial
judge
has
to
sentence
under
the
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unless
he
makes
the
finding
called
for
by
(d)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
we
know
mr.
norton
under
what
--
the
trial
judge
at
anytime
say
i
am
not
going
to
sentence
under
the
youth
corrections
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
we
--
and
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
at
the
time
of
sentence
in
any
event,
he
did
not
say
i
am
sentencing
under
the
act
or
i
am
not
sentencing
him?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
he
referred
to
what
he
did
at
the
time
of
sentence
as
an
interpretation
--
as
a
sentence
outside
of
the
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
mr.
norton
or
is
this
the
government’s
position
that
you
never
get
to
any
of
these
issues
under
(d)
or
anything
else
under
the
youth
offenders
statute
until
the
judge
decides
that
he
is
going
to
sentence
him
under
that
statute.
in
other
words,
what
you
have
been
saying
to
us
is
that
the
proponents
of
this
legislation
had
no
intention
of
stripping
the
judges
of
authority
to
sentence
under
some
other
penalty
provisions
that
they
did
not
care
to
use
this
act.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
really,
it
seems
to
me
when
you
parse
the
statute
down,
(a)
which
permits
probation,
the
judge
decides
“well,
i
am
going
to
sentence
under
this
act.”
well,
i
do
not
want
to
sentence
under
(a),
i
don't
want
to
give
him
probation.
i
think
he
ought
to
be
incarcerated
for
treatment.
and
so
i
will
sentence
him
under
either
(b)
or
(c).
and
then
(d)
comes
into
effect,
when
he
decides
that
maybe
he
would
not
derive
on
the
benefit
from
treatment
under
(b)
and
(c)
and
therefore,
i
can
sentence
under
any
other
applicable
penalty
provision
which
would
be
under
some
other
statute
or
i
might
go
back
to
(a)
for
the
probation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
that’s
so
mr.
norton
[attempt
to
laughter],
it
just
strikes
me
that
if
the
judge
has
the
option
to
use
the
statute
or
not,
you
do
not
get
any
of
these
questions
until
he
decides
he
is
going
to
use
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right
now,
and
if
we
do
not
agree
with
that
position
and
agree
with
yours
that
the
judge
was
free
to
use
this
or
not
and
that
on
this
record,
he
decided
that
he
would
not
use
the
statute,
why
is
it
not
the
end
of
the
case
without
ever
giving
of
the
question
whether
there
have
to
be
findings
under
(d)
or
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
case
where
on
the
record
that
appeared,
i
haven’t
read
that
decision
that
it
appeared
then
in
fact
the
sentencing
was
under
the
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
is
that
been
under
an
interpretation
of
this
statute
as
the
statute
which
must
if
applicable
be
used
in
the
sentencing
a
youth
offender?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(inaudible)
now
on
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
rather
than
the
united
states
of
columbia?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
case
to
mr.
norton,
this
was
a
young
college
student,
wasn’t
he,
second
year
in
college?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
time
he
have
ever
had
any
difficulty
in
his
life,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
i
would
suppose
the
judge
would
decide
i
will
give
him
--
i
have
to
give
him
something
but
i
will
be
as
lenient
as
i
can
be
and
so
he
gave
him
90
days
plus
probation.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
this
was
not
the
kind
of
offender
who
ought
to
be
or
who
needed
to
be
sent
to
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
for
treatment
for
four
to
six
years?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
it
goes
back
for
re-sentencing
under
the
youth
corrections
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
kind
of
sentence
may
the
judge
impose?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
suppose
he
had
--
i

your

well,
then
i
gather
the
argument
of

whether

under

and
so

then
he

with

does

i
am
