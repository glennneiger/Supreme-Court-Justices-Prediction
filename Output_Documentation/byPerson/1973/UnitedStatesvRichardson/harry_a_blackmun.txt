justice
harry
a.
blackmun
general
bork,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
has
nothing
to
do
really
i
suppose
on
the
merits.
this
case
was
heard
en
banc
for
the
third
circuit.
i
notice
that
district
judge
kraft
sat
on
the
en
banc
panel,
do
you
know
on
what
authority
he
participated?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
is
what
i
question
because
section
46
(c)
makes
no
reference
whatsoever
to
a
district
judge
who
sat
on
the
panel.
it
makes
reference
only
to
a
circuit
judge
of
the
circuit
who
has
retired
sitting
on
the
panel.
and
my
point
i
guess
is
that
with
an
eight-judge
court
would
judge
rosen
desist
judge
kraft’s
status
in
my
view
somewhat
questionable
and
chief
judge
sykes
not
participating
with
majority.
i
wonder
where
the
five
to
three-vote
really
comes
out
today.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
are
making
no
point
of
it,
but
i
am
