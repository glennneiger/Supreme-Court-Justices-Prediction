justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
do
not
address
yourself
in
the
brief
or
to
the
--
or
in
your
oral
argument
to
the
question
of
justifiability
it’s
--
the
district
court
said
--
how
do
you
view
the
district
court’s
decision
to
dismiss?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
what
ground
did
he
dismiss?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don’t
--
your
suggestion
is
that
if
we
disagreed
with
you
on
standing
i
take
it
you
anticipate
we
would
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
political
question
or
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
do
not
address
yourself
to
that
issue
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
that
it
did
not
reach
here
the
political
question
--
it
must
have
reversed
to
district
court
on
that
too,
it
must
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
dismissal
on
that
ground
was
reversed
also
by
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
do
you
agree
with
that,
i
take
it
that
you
agree
with
that.
that
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
standing
we
--
the
government
agrees
then
that
the
case
should
go
back
to
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
about
the
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action?(voice
overlap)
that
would
still
have
to
be
reached?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
it
wouldn’t
be
that
–
it
would
be
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
to
whether
we're
satisfied
perhaps
by
the
congressional
--
by
the
statutes
on
the
books?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
a
good
part
of
your
argument
here
has
been
that
this
really
--
the
prosecution
really
assigns
the
enforcement
or
the
reaction
to
this
provision,
to
the
account’s
provision
to
the
congress
and
that’
part
of
your
standing
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet
you
don’t
say
that
--
you
don’t
make
any
separate
point
of
--
out
of
it
as
a
political
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
really
saying
that
if
we
reject
standard,
we
reject
your
standing
argument
we
are
also
necessarily
rejecting
the
political
question
side
of
your
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
win
on
your
standing
argument
and
still
lose
on
that
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
merits,
on
the
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
--
that
the
law
wasn't
violated?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
fraenkel,
i
do
not
still
understand
that
why
you
say
we
don’t
--
we
aren’t
--
we
would
not
be
compelled
to
reach
the
political
question
issue
if
we
agreed
with
you
on
standing?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the
court
of
appeals
did
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
at
least
dealt
with
standing
--
dealt
with
political
question
to
the
extent
that
by
--
upholding
that
it
was
right,
that
it
was
intertwined
with
the
merit.
now
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
affirm
the
judge
--
if
we
have
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
we're
also
affirming
their
judgment
that
political
question
doctrine
did
not
justify
the
dismissal
by
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
we
--
we
do
then
even
if
we
don’t
say
anything
about
it
if
we
affirm
saying
nothing
we
would
at
least
be
affirming
their
dealing
with
the
political
question
to
that
extent?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
do
you
think
we
at
least
need
to
say
something
if
we
agreed
with
your
understanding,
mustn’t
we
at
least
then
say
at
least
something
about
political
question
say
we
also
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals,
political
questions
often
is
intertwined
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
suggesting
that
we
really
should
decide
something
about
saying
so?(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
not
necessary
in
your
view?
justice
byron
