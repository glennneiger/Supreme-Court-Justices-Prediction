mr.
solicitor

if
it's
just
for
the
benefit
of
congress,
i
would
think
congress
could
have
provided
for
that
by
law
for
finding
it
the
constitution?
doesn’t
that
suggest
that
it
is
does
designed
the
benefit
somebody
in
addition
to
congress?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
his
claim
would
be
under
the
bill
of
rights
and
not
under
the
republican
form
of
government
law,
was
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
couldn’t
it
just
as
well
had
been
argued
in
levitt
that
the
senate
had
no
power
to
confirm
justice
black
because
he
had
voted
to
increase
the
emolument
of
the
office
which
was
sum
of
the
constitution
then
prohibited
him
from
taking?
justice

rehnquist
mr.
fraenkel,
do
you
think
there
is
a
fairly
sharp
line
between
the
concept
of
standing
and
concept
of
political
question?
