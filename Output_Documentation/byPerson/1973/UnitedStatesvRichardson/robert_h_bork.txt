mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
at
this
stage
is
only
an
issue
of
federal
taxpayer
standing
and
the
question
is
whether
the
exception
made
in
the
rule
of
frothingham
against
mellon
by
the
later
decision
of
flast
against
cohen
should
be
widened
to
grandstanding
in
cases
not
involving
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
of
clauses
of
the
first
amendment.
the
government
will
attempt
to
demonstrate
that
an
affirmative
answer,
the
answer
the
respondent
here
seeks
would
effectively
overrule
all
of
frothingham
which
flast
did
not
purport
to
do,
and
would
probably
destroy
the
concept
of
standing
altogether.
that
result
we
think
is
precluded
by
considerations
rooted
in
article
iii
of
the
constitution,
and
by
considerations
relating
to
the
role
of
this
court
and
other
federal
courts
in
exercising
the
power
of
judicial
review.
respondent
brought
this
suit
in
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania
to
enjoin
the
publication
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
of
the
combined
statements
of
receipts,
expenditures
and
balances
of
united
states
government
on
the
ground
that,
that
document
does
not
identify
appropriations
for
and
expenditures
by
the
central
intelligence
agency.
now,
this
confidentiality
of
cia
funding,
its
spending
is
expressly
provided
by
statute
as
an
exception
to
the
general
statute
which
requires
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
annually
lay
before
congress
the
combined
statement.
the
cia
budget
of
course
is
reflected
in
the
total
figures
in
the
combined
statement,
but
it
is
not
identified
as
such.
respondent’s
theory
is
that
this
congressionally
provided
confidentiality
violates
the
statements
and
accounts
clause
of
article
i,
section
9,
clause
7
which
reads,
“no
money
shall
be
drawn
from
the
treasury,
but
in
consequence
of
appropriations
made
by
law
and
a
regular
statement
and
account
of
the
receipts
and
expenditures
of
all
public
money
shall
be
published
from
time
to
time.
the
district
court
dismissed
respondent’s
complaint
on
the
ground
that
he
lacks
standing
as
a
taxpayer,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
sitting
en
banc
reversed
with
three
judges
dissenting.
i
would
like
to
approach
this
case
initially
through
an
examination
of
flast
against
cohen
in
an
attempt
to
show
that,
that
case
denies
respondents
standing
here.
and
then
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
issue
of
constitutional
policy
and
argue
that
the
standing
concept
in
cases
like
this
is
in
article
iii
concept
as
flast
against
cohen
recognizes
and
it’s
important
to
preserve
that
concept.
i
think
the
majority
opinion
in
flast
plainly
denies
standing
in
this
case.
only
if
the
limits
set
by
that
case
to
taxpayer's
standing
are
abandoned
can
respondent
here
be
accorded
standing
and
of
course
flast
must
be
seen
against
the
background
of
frothingham
against
mellon.
in
that
case,
in
frothingham,
the
taxpayer
attacked
the
constitutionality
of
the
maternity
act
of
1921
which
setup
a
federal
program
to
grant
--
make
grants
to
states
who
would
undertake
programs
to
reduce
maternal
and
infant
mortality.
and
the
taxpayer
sued
and
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
maternity
act
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
exceeded
the
powers
delegated
to
congress
under
article
i,
that
it
violated
the
powers
reserved
to
the
states
by
the
tenth
amendment
and
that
deprived
her
through
the
taxing
process
of
her
property
without
due
process
of
law
under
the
fifth
amendment.
those
are
constitutional
claims
that
at
that
time
were
certainly
regarded
as
quite
as
important
as
any
constitutional
claim
to
respondents
who
seeks
to
litigate
here.
but
this
court
nevertheless
denied
standing
and
that
rule
against
taxpayers
standing
stood
in
violate
until
flast.
the
flast
majority
was
very
careful
to
the
state
that
it
was
reading
the
frothingham
rule
intact
except
for
the
defined
category
of
cases
and
the
exception
it
made
in
the
frothingham
rule
was
for
cases
in
which
the
taxpayer
could
show
a
logical
annexes
between
the
taxpayers’
status
and
the
claim
he
sought
to
adjudicate
and
that
logical
nexus
test
breaks
down
into
two
further
tests
in
flast.
first,
there
must
be
a
logical
link
between
the
taxpayers’
status
and
the
type
of
legislative
enactment
sought
to
be
attacked.
and
second,
there
must
be
similar
nexus
between
the
test
status
of
taxpayer
and
the
precise
nature
of
the
constitutional
infringement
alleged.
i
don’t
think,
pardon
me,
the
respondent
in
this
case
can
satisfy
either
of
those
tests.
the
flast
opinion
set
up
this
first
nexus,
the
one
between
the
status
of
taxpayer
and
the
enactment
to
this
challenge.
i
quote
a
taxpayer
would
be
a
proper
party
to
allege
the
unconstitutionality,
only
of
exercises
of
congressional
power
under
the
taxing
and
spending
clause
of
article
i,
section
8.
the
respondent
here
of
course
is
not
attacking
any
exercise
of
the
taxing
and
spending
power
under
article
--
under
section
8.
he
is
attacking
a
reporting
provision
under
section
9.
the
court
in
flast
continued,
“it
will
not
be
sufficient
for
a
taxpayer
to
allege
an
incidental
expenditure
of
tax
funds
in
the
administration
of
an
essentially
regulatory
statute.”
now
i
would
like
to
make
two
observations
about
that
first
test
in
connection
with
this
case.
the
first
is
that
here
the
respondent
makes
no
complaint
of
any
injury
to
his
pocket
book.
he
is
not
saying
that
any
tax
money
is
being
taken
from
him
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
so
that
there
is
no
link
between
the
status
he
asserts,
that
of
a
taxpayer
and
the
statute
permitting
cia
funding
to
be
placed
in
the
budgets
of
other
agencies
or
departments.
it’s
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
matter
that
what
he
has
is
the
interest
common
to
all
citizens,
that
is
as
this
court
has
put
it,
merely
a
general
interest
common
to
all
members
of
the
public
and
that
he
seeks
to
air
his
generalized
grievances
about
the
conduct
of
government
and
those
are
precisely
the
phrases
of
this
court
has
used
to
describe
a
litigant
who
has
no
standing.
the
second
observation
i
would
like
to
make
about
this
first
test
in
flast
is
that
the
theory
of
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
i
believe
the
theory
of
the
respondent
here
is
that
the
first
flast
test
is
satisfied
because
the
respondent
is
injured
by
lack
of
knowledge
about
the
cia
budget.
as
the
respondent’s
brief
puts
it,
it
is
the
intimacy
of
the
constitutional
provision
to
the
spending
process
that
is
relevant.
if
that
were
the
test,
then
flast
actually
left
no
vestiture
to
frothingham
despite
its
protestations
to
the
contrary.
taxpayers
would
have
i
think,
under
that
test,
standing
to
litigate
any
grievance
that
is
colorably
related
to
the
appropriation
process.
and
that
in
turn
would
inject
the
courts
into
every
imaginable
question
bearing
on
the
constitutionality
of
actions
by
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
at
the
request
of
every
disgruntled
taxpayer,
who
wanted
to
oppose
some
governmental
program
or
procedure.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
am
--
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
am
unable
for
the
moment
to
imagine
how
this
particular
provision
could
be
attacked,
but
of
course
that
is
not
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes
the
court,
the
court
yes,
but
that
of
course
is
not
a
unusual
situation
with
constitutional
provisions.
for
a
variety
of
reasons
just
as
you
can
be
among
them,
a
variety
of
constitutional
provisions
may
not
be
enforced
by
a
court.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
undoubtedly,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
congress
could
require
them
to
specify
the
number
and
salary
level
of
every
secret
agents
throughout
the
rest
of
the
world.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
the
--
a
question
we
must
get
into
it
to
some
degree
at
least
mr.
chief
justice
that
it
also
impinges
upon
the
ultimate
question
if
the
respondent
were
found
to
have
standing,
but
i
think
the
second
flast
test
which
talks
about
what
is
the
purpose
of
a
constitutional
provision
necessarily
requires
to
be
talked
about
that
as
well.
i
think
the
history
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no
i
was
about
mr.
chief
justice
to
discuss
that
very
point.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
second
flast
test
is
of
course
the
question
of
whether
the
taxpayer
has
stated
a
relationship
and
nexus
between
themselves
and
the
constitutional
provision.
and
as
our
position
is
you
just
suggested,
it
might
be
mr.
chief
justice,
that
in
fact
this
provision
is
designed
toward
the
protection
of
congress.
it's
designed
to
give
congress
control
over
executive
spending
to
find
out
what
the
executive
is
spending
and
what
the
executive
is
receiving.
i
think
that’s
apparent
both
from
the
history
of
the
statute
although
the
history
is
not
free
from
ambiguity
in
all
candor,
but
i
think
is
even
more
apparent
from
the
necessary
construction
of
this
clause
in
connection
with
other
clauses.
in
the
history,
the
history
is
set
forth
in
our
brief,
the
opposition
of
george
mason
and
patrick
henry
to
this
clause
of
the
constitution
was
apparently
founded
upon
the
fact
that
it
might
allow
secrecy
and
expend
some
accounts.
in
addition
to
that
in
a
phrase
which
is
perhaps
not
entirely
free
from
bad
ambiguity,
but
i
think
it
supports
the
government’s
position
here.
in
the
debate
in
the
constitutional
convention
on
this
clause
in
september
14
which
is
reported
in
2
farrand's
records
at
page
619.
james
wilson
of
pennsylvania
supported
the
motion
to
change
the
provision
before
them
from
an
accounting
year-by-year
in
annual
accounting
to
an
accounting
from
time-to-time
which
is
the
present
language
in
the
clause,
by
saying
that
many
operations
of
finance
cannot
be
properly
published
at
certain
times.
but
i
think
we
rely
unless
upon
that
history
which
i
think
is
incomplete
than
we
do
upon
two
other
factors.
one
is,
but
after
that
history
it
became
regular
practice
for
the
congress
to
keep
some
appropriations
secret
when
the
occasion
of
the
national
interest
seem
to
demand
it.
our
brief
at
page
26
points
to
the
fact
that
there
was
secret
appropriation
in
1811
to
$100,000.00
i
believe
for
the
occupation
of
spanish
florida
an
act
by
the
congress
which
obviously
had
a
great
deal
of
sensitivity
in
foreign
affairs.
that
appropriation
was
kept
secret
for
seven
years
until
1818
when
it
was
published
and
of
course
the
most
famous
example
of
this
kind
of
procedure
was
the
$2
billion
secretly
spent
to
develop
the
atom
bomb
in
the
manhattan
project
during
world
war
ii.
so
i
think
there
is
a
course
to
the
historic
practice
which
supports
the
idea
that
this
is
--
the
reporting
is
in
the
control
of
congress
and
its
intended
to
give
congress
control
over
what
the
executive
is
doing
with
funds.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
wouldn’t
think
so.
there
are
a
number
of
things
in
the
constitution,
i
think
which
give
powers
exclusively
to
congress
and
are
for
the
benefit
of
congress
and
not
for
the
benefit
of
others.
the
power
to
expel
members,
the
power
to
pass
on
for
the
qualifications
and
a
variety
of
others.
i
don’t
think
every
constitutional
provision
is
because
it
is
a
constitutional
provision
necessarily
designed
to
be
enforced
by
the
citizens.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
entirely
true
mr.
justice
stewart
by
hypothesis.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
entirely
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
entirely
true.
the
question
always
is,
is
it
enforceable
by
every
member
of
the
public
and
our
position
here
is
that
this
is
a
provision
enforceable
by
congress
and
waivable
by
congress
and
not
enforceable
by
every
citizen
who
may
object
to
the
way
congress
enforces
it.
if
he
does
object
to
the
way
congress
enforces,
i
think
his
clear
remedy
is
to
deal
with
congress
and
try
--
if
he
wants
the
cia
budget
published,
the
simple
matter
is
to
go
to
a
congressman
and
go
to
his
congress
and
get
other
like-minded
citizens
to
get
congress
to
require
that
the
cia
be
--
budget
be
published.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
but
i
think
from
other
aspect
of
this
derived
from
the
consideration
of
the
structure
which
the
constitution
puts
together
in
the
case
that,
that
is
the
correct
reading
of
this
clause.
it'd
be
exceedingly
strange
just
in
passing
if
the
framers
had
believed
they
would
never
be
matters
relating
to
foreign
affairs
and
never
be
matters
relating
to
military
affairs
and
military
intelligence
that
must
not
be
disclosed
to
the
world
in
full.
that’s
--
that
would
be
attributing
to
the
framers
a
lack
of
practicality
which
i
don’t
think
we
may
attribute
to
them.
now,
the
respondent’s
brief
attempts
to
find
the
negative
pregnant
in
the
fact
that
the
constitution
explicitly
authorizes
in
article
i,
section
5,
clause
3,
each
house
to
keep
secret
its
debates
and
decisions
on
matters
that
it
believes
require
secrecy
and
respondent
argues
that
see
they
knew
how
to
provide
for
secrecy
when
it
was
called
for
and
the
fact
that
they
did
not
provide
for
it
in
the
statement
and
accounts
clause,
explicitly
means
that
it
doesn’t
exist,
power
of
confidentiality
does
not
exist.
i
think
the
necessary
inference
runs
quite
the
other
way.
it
would
be
extraordinary
if
the
framers
had
intended
the
house
in
the
senate
to
be
able
to
keep
secret
matters
which
they
regarded
as
sensitive,
but
at
the
same
time
required
the
executive
to
publish
those
same
matters
to
the
world.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
mr.
chief
justice
i
hope
it’s
not
because
i
cannot
answer
the
question.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
have
not
--
i
have
heard
those
complaints,
i
have
not
inquired
into
the
details
here.
perhaps,
i
should
say
something
that
question
brings
to
mind
and
that
is
that
these
matters,
the
cia
funding
is
not
kept
secret
entirely
from
congress.
obviously,
the
matter
is
sensitive.
the
appropriation’s
committees
of
both
the
house
and
the
senate
have
sub-committees
to
which
the
cia
budget
and
expenditures
are
reported
and
from
time-to-time
in
the
senate
there
is
joint
membership
between
the
armed
services
committee
and
the
budget
committee.
so
there
is
a
congressional
check
on
this
process.
it
is
just
that
it
is
deemed
wise
i
suppose
that
matters
of
this
sensitivity
not
be
given
to
bodies
of
the
size
of
the
full
house
and
the
full
senate.
i
think
then
it
is
fairly
plain
i
think
that
the
respondents
claim
the
standing
as
a
taxpayer
doesn’t
meet
either
first
or
the
second
flast
test
requiring
a
logical
nexus
between
his
status
and
enactment
and
his
status
in
the
constitution.
when
you
think
about
--
when
i
think
about
his
claim
to
standing
here,
it
seems
to
me
that
he'd
be
indistinguishable
from
the
claim
to
standing
made
in
ex
parte
levitt
where
a
citizen
and
a
member
the
bar
of
this
court
filed
a
motion
requiring,
asking
that
mr.
justice
black
be
required
to
show
cause
why
he
should
not
be
disqualified
to
be
a
member
of
this
court
because
of
article
i,
section
6,
clause
2.
and
the
court
thought
so
little
of
that
claim
that
they
dismissed
with
per
curiam
opinion
saying
that
they
did
not
sit
to
discuss
generalized
grievances
about
the
way
the
government
is
operating.
i
think
this
case
is
also
indistinguishable
from
laird
against
tatum.
that
was
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
citizen
interest
in
the
possible
chilling
effect
in
army
intelligence
system
though
there
was
no
direct
impact
upon
the
plaintiffs.
and
they
were
denied
standing,
the
case
is
already
standing
case
that
cites
ex
parte
levitt
for
its
main
holding.
i
would
think
that
citizens
in
general
would
have
as
much
interest
in
the
possible
and
alleged
chilling
effect
from
an
army
surveillance
system
upon
first
amendment
values
as
citizen
if
in
general
would
have
here
upon
the
reporting
of
the
cia
budget.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
ex
parte
levitt,
mr.
justice
stewart
is
found
at
302
u.s.
633.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
so
i
think
the
laird
v.
tatum
is
also
a
direct
holding
and
a
more
recent
one,
laird
than
ex
parte
levitt,
that
there
is
no
standing
in
this
case,
i
think
i
should
say
why
i
think
it’s
important,
why
i
think
standing
is
much
more
than
a
rule
of
judicial
self-restraint
or
discretionary
rule
as
the
respondent’s
brief
puts
it
and
as
some
of
the
cases
put
it,
i
think
it
is.
we
can
see
what
the
standing
here
is
in
article
iii
doctrine.
it's
a
doctrine
relates
fundamentally
to
the
way
that
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts
(inaudible)
in
judicial
review.
it
is
usually
said
that
standing
isn’t
an
issue
of
whether
the
party
is
a
proper
one.
whereas
justiciability
is
an
issue,
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
issue
was
one
that’s
suitable
for
a
court
to
handle.
i
think
that
it
is
not
put
it
quite
accurately.
i
think
standing
is
a
branch
of
justiciability
because
it
goes
--
it
examines
the
party
only
to
discover
whether
he
is
a
party
who
will
put
the
issue
in
the
forum,
in
a
forum
which
is
suitable
for
judicial
resolution.
and
that
makes
it
i
think
an
aspect
or
a
subdivision
of
justiciability
and
i
think
the
flast
opinion
agrees
that
indeed
it
is
an
aspect
of
justiciability,
it
is
an
article
iii
doctrine.
it
has
also
said
that
the
doctrine
one
having
to
do
with
whether
the
issue
will
be
presented
by
sufficient
adverseness.
i
suppose
extending
standing
to
all
citizens
might
require
--
might
result
in
the
decline
in
the
vigor
of
adversary
presentation
in
some
cases,
it
is
also
necessary
to
admit
that
it
will
not
in
many
because
citizen
standing
will
be
used
often
by
persons
with
ideological
interests
or
groups
with
ideological
interests
who
will
press
the
case
with
great
vigor.
so,
i
am
not
so
sure
that
the
decline
in
vigor
presentation
is
a
general
problem,
although
it
maybe
in
some
cases.
what
standing
and
the
requirement
of
an
injury
in
fact
actually
does
is
delay
the
presentation
of
the
issue
to
the
court
until
the
law
challenged
has
some
actual
impact
upon
members
of
the
society
and
i
think
that’s
important
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
one
is
that
we
ought
to
examine
cases,
the
courts
ought
to
examine
cases
in
concrete
factual
settings
because
our
constitutional
law
too
is
law
that
has
a
common
law
tradition.
a
common
law
of
jurisprudence
and
we
like
to
concrete
factual
settings
because
they
qualify
the
rules
announced
in
the
cases.
they
explained
the
meanings
of
the
rule
to
people
who
must
read
the
cases
and
they
help
the
court
in
imagining
the
difficulties
they
can
get
into
with
a
particular
rule
because
it
is
presented
with
factual
situations
that
indicate
the
complexities
that
are
involved.
so
the
standing
issue
aside
from
being
--
it
is
also
has
an
aspect
of
fairness
to
parties
who
maybe
interested.
that
is
a
party
may
have
a
specific
injury
done
to
him
and
a
rule
of
citizen
or
taxpayer
standing
might
result
in
somebody
who
does
not
have
such
interests
or
a
factual
setting
getting
to
the
courts
first
with
this
case
and
perhaps
resulting
in
a
rule
that
would
not
have
been
arrived
or
not
arrived
at
in
precisely
that
form,
had
a
person
with
a
real
person's
stake
had
been
in
the
case.
but
primary,
i
think
the
concept
is
important
as
a
rule
of
fairness
to
the
court.
i
think
not
just
fairness
to
the
court,
but
the
ability
of
the
court
to
perform
the
awesome
function
of
judicial
review
with
maximum
effectiveness
sanction.
where
there
is
citizen
standing
and
taxpayer
standing,
generally,
is
quite
plain
i
think
that
we
would
have
an
increased
number
of
groups
and
persons
who
would
attack
the
statutes
the
moment
they
were
enacted.
who
would
attack
executive
programs
the
moment
they
were
announced
and
having
standing,
they
would
find
themselves
in
court
debating
abstract
theorems
instantly.
there
are
two
things
wrong
with
that.
i
have
already
discussed
i
think
what’s
wrong
with
that
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
the
issues
are
not
quite
well
without
a
concrete
factual
setting.
but
there’s
also
something
wrong
with
ideological
litigation
in
that
lawyers
in
such
litigation
often
do
not
explore
the
issues
fully.
they
are
looking
for
a
sweeping
constitutional
result
and
are
likely
not
to
explore
narrow
or
statutory
or
factual
problems
that
maybe
quite
important
to
the
court.
whereas
a
person
with
a
personal
stake
wants
to
win
the
case
and
will
explore
every
ground
upon
which
he
might
win
that
case.
this
kind
of
standing
which
would
come
immediately
after
a
law
has
passed
or
statute
or
executive
action
announced
means
that
the
court
at
the
behest
of
such
a
litigant
and
ideological
litigant
does
not
want
to
explore
all
the
concrete
settings,
in
fact
there
is
no
concrete
setting,
would
in
effect
repeat
the
legislative
or
executive
decision
making
process
that
had
just
concluded
and
would
probably
repeat
it
with
fewer
materials
than
were
available
to
the
legislature
and
to
the
executive
in
arriving
at
the
decision,
i
don’t
think
that,
that
is
the
court’s
test
in
the
system
of
judicial
review.
it
makes
the
court
into
something
like
the
counsel
of
revision,
the
framers
rejected.
it
puts
the
court
in
something
of
the
position
of
giving
advisory
opinions
and
i
think
that
would
be
most
unfortunate
for
the
function
of
this
court.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
don’t
know
the
authority.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
our
brief
or
in
our
petition
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
am
having
difficulty
at
moment
locating
the
footnote.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
we
did
say
that
there
was
only
some
doubt,
probably
it
was
incorrect,
but
in
this
case
we
do
not
make
a
big
point.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
page
6.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
i
think
it
was
entirely
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
district
court
dismissed
on
both
grounds
of
standing
and
political
question.
the
court
of
appeals
sitting
en
banc
addressed
only
the
standing
issue
because
it
thought
it
that
the
political
question
issue
was
so
entwined,
intertwined
with
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
or
to
the
district
court
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
think
that
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
that
the
political
question
issue
could
be
resolved
much
more
effectively
if
we
were
into
the
full
merits
of
the
case
than
we
can
at
this
stage.
i
think
standing
is
all
that
really
can
be
effectively
discussed
in
the
posture
of
the
case
is
in
now.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
in
the
sense
that
if
--
i
suppose
it
did
in
the
sense
that
it
said
political
question
was
not
properly
considered
until
we
got
to
the
merits.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes
it
was
mr.
justice
white,
but
not
on
the
ground
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
about
political
question
but
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
would
be
the
merits,
we
have
to
reached
the
question
of
whether
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
the
meaning
of
article
i,
clause
--
section
7
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it’s
little
hard
to
tell
mr.
chief
justice
exactly
what
the
district
court’s
reasoning
process
was
because
the
order
and
memorandum
did
not
it
spell
it
out
very
well.
perhaps,
he
thought
that
when
he
said
it
was
a
political
question.
no,
i
do
not
think
that
when
he
said
that
he
thought
he
was
construing
article
i.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true
and
i
am
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
on
the
separate
point
at
this
stage,
i
am
--
the
flast
tests
drive
one
into
a
consideration
of
what
that
--
i
suppose
i
am
saying
the
same
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that
there
maybe
more
to
the
political
question
doctrine
than
that
and
i
would
certainly
like
a
chance
to
explore
it
below
if
we
--
while
the
standing
here
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
since
the
third
circuit
is
already
ruled
mr.
justice
brennan
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
they
have
said
that
the
–
that
it’s
not
appropriate
in
this
forum
to
discuss
political
question
because
you
have
to
go
fully
into
the
meaning
of
the
clause
in
question
into
the
merits
in
order
to
get
the
political
question.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
not
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
at
this
stage
is
only
an
issue
of
federal
taxpayer
standing
and
the
question
is
whether
the
exception
made
in
the
rule
of
frothingham
against
mellon
by
the
later
decision
of
flast
against
cohen
should
be
widened
to
grandstanding
in
cases
not
involving
the
establishment
clause
and
the
free
exercise
of
clauses
of
the
first
amendment.
the
government
will
attempt
to
demonstrate
that
an
affirmative
answer,
the
answer
the
respondent
here
seeks
would
effectively
overrule
all
of
frothingham
which
flast
did
not
purport
to
do,
and
would
probably
destroy
the
concept
of
standing
altogether.
that
result
we
think
is
precluded
by
considerations
rooted
in
article
iii
of
the
constitution,
and
by
considerations
relating
to
the
role
of
this
court
and
other
federal
courts
in
exercising
the
power
of
judicial
review.
respondent
brought
this
suit
in
the
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania
to
enjoin
the
publication
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
of
the
combined
statements
of
receipts,
expenditures
and
balances
of
united
states
government
on
the
ground
that,
that
document
does
not
identify
appropriations
for
and
expenditures
by
the
central
intelligence
agency.
now,
this
confidentiality
of
cia
funding,
its
spending
is
expressly
provided
by
statute
as
an
exception
to
the
general
statute
which
requires
that
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
annually
lay
before
congress
the
combined
statement.
the
cia
budget
of
course
is
reflected
in
the
total
figures
in
the
combined
statement,
but
it
is
not
identified
as
such.
respondent’s
theory
is
that
this
congressionally
provided
confidentiality
violates
the
statements
and
accounts
clause
of
article
i,
section
9,
clause
7
which
reads,
“no
money
shall
be
drawn
from
the
treasury,
but
in
consequence
of
appropriations
made
by
law
and
a
regular
statement
and
account
of
the
receipts
and
expenditures
of
all
public
money
shall
be
published
from
time
to
time.
the
district
court
dismissed
respondent’s
complaint
on
the
ground
that
he
lacks
standing
as
a
taxpayer,
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
sitting
en
banc
reversed
with
three
judges
dissenting.
i
would
like
to
approach
this
case
initially
through
an
examination
of
flast
against
cohen
in
an
attempt
to
show
that,
that
case
denies
respondents
standing
here.
and
then
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
issue
of
constitutional
policy
and
argue
that
the
standing
concept
in
cases
like
this
is
in
article
iii
concept
as
flast
against
cohen
recognizes
and
it’s
important
to
preserve
that
concept.
i
think
the
majority
opinion
in
flast
plainly
denies
standing
in
this
case.
only
if
the
limits
set
by
that
case
to
taxpayer's
standing
are
abandoned
can
respondent
here
be
accorded
standing
and
of
course
flast
must
be
seen
against
the
background
of
frothingham
against
mellon.
in
that
case,
in
frothingham,
the
taxpayer
attacked
the
constitutionality
of
the
maternity
act
of
1921
which
setup
a
federal
program
to
grant
--
make
grants
to
states
who
would
undertake
programs
to
reduce
maternal
and
infant
mortality.
and
the
taxpayer
sued
and
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
maternity
act
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
exceeded
the
powers
delegated
to
congress
under
article
i,
that
it
violated
the
powers
reserved
to
the
states
by
the
tenth
amendment
and
that
deprived
her
through
the
taxing
process
of
her
property
without
due
process
of
law
under
the
fifth
amendment.
those
are
constitutional
claims
that
at
that
time
were
certainly
regarded
as
quite
as
important
as
any
constitutional
claim
to
respondents
who
seeks
to
litigate
here.
but
this
court
nevertheless
denied
standing
and
that
rule
against
taxpayers
standing
stood
in
violate
until
flast.
the
flast
majority
was
very
careful
to
the
state
that
it
was
reading
the
frothingham
rule
intact
except
for
the
defined
category
of
cases
and
the
exception
it
made
in
the
frothingham
rule
was
for
cases
in
which
the
taxpayer
could
show
a
logical
annexes
between
the
taxpayers’
status
and
the
claim
he
sought
to
adjudicate
and
that
logical
nexus
test
breaks
down
into
two
further
tests
in
flast.
first,
there
must
be
a
logical
link
between
the
taxpayers’
status
and
the
type
of
legislative
enactment
sought
to
be
attacked.
and
second,
there
must
be
similar
nexus
between
the
test
status
of
taxpayer
and
the
precise
nature
of
the
constitutional
infringement
alleged.
i
don’t
think,
pardon
me,
the
respondent
in
this
case
can
satisfy
either
of
those
tests.
the
flast
opinion
set
up
this
first
nexus,
the
one
between
the
status
of
taxpayer
and
the
enactment
to
this
challenge.
i
quote
a
taxpayer
would
be
a
proper
party
to
allege
the
unconstitutionality,
only
of
exercises
of
congressional
power
under
the
taxing
and
spending
clause
of
article
i,
section
8.
the
respondent
here
of
course
is
not
attacking
any
exercise
of
the
taxing
and
spending
power
under
article
--
under
section
8.
he
is
attacking
a
reporting
provision
under
section
9.
the
court
in
flast
continued,
“it
will
not
be
sufficient
for
a
taxpayer
to
allege
an
incidental
expenditure
of
tax
funds
in
the
administration
of
an
essentially
regulatory
statute.”
now
i
would
like
to
make
two
observations
about
that
first
test
in
connection
with
this
case.
the
first
is
that
here
the
respondent
makes
no
complaint
of
any
injury
to
his
pocket
book.
he
is
not
saying
that
any
tax
money
is
being
taken
from
him
in
violation
of
the
constitution.
so
that
there
is
no
link
between
the
status
he
asserts,
that
of
a
taxpayer
and
the
statute
permitting
cia
funding
to
be
placed
in
the
budgets
of
other
agencies
or
departments.
it’s
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
matter
that
what
he
has
is
the
interest
common
to
all
citizens,
that
is
as
this
court
has
put
it,
merely
a
general
interest
common
to
all
members
of
the
public
and
that
he
seeks
to
air
his
generalized
grievances
about
the
conduct
of
government
and
those
are
precisely
the
phrases
of
this
court
has
used
to
describe
a
litigant
who
has
no
standing.
the
second
observation
i
would
like
to
make
about
this
first
test
in
flast
is
that
the
theory
of
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
and
i
believe
the
theory
of
the
respondent
here
is
that
the
first
flast
test
is
satisfied
because
the
respondent
is
injured
by
lack
of
knowledge
about
the
cia
budget.
as
the
respondent’s
brief
puts
it,
it
is
the
intimacy
of
the
constitutional
provision
to
the
spending
process
that
is
relevant.
if
that
were
the
test,
then
flast
actually
left
no
vestiture
to
frothingham
despite
its
protestations
to
the
contrary.
taxpayers
would
have
i
think,
under
that
test,
standing
to
litigate
any
grievance
that
is
colorably
related
to
the
appropriation
process.
and
that
in
turn
would
inject
the
courts
into
every
imaginable
question
bearing
on
the
constitutionality
of
actions
by
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
at
the
request
of
every
disgruntled
taxpayer,
who
wanted
to
oppose
some
governmental
program
or
procedure.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
am
--
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
am
unable
for
the
moment
to
imagine
how
this
particular
provision
could
be
attacked,
but
of
course
that
is
not
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes
the
court,
the
court
yes,
but
that
of
course
is
not
a
unusual
situation
with
constitutional
provisions.
for
a
variety
of
reasons
just
as
you
can
be
among
them,
a
variety
of
constitutional
provisions
may
not
be
enforced
by
a
court.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
undoubtedly,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
congress
could
require
them
to
specify
the
number
and
salary
level
of
every
secret
agents
throughout
the
rest
of
the
world.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
the
--
a
question
we
must
get
into
it
to
some
degree
at
least
mr.
chief
justice
that
it
also
impinges
upon
the
ultimate
question
if
the
respondent
were
found
to
have
standing,
but
i
think
the
second
flast
test
which
talks
about
what
is
the
purpose
of
a
constitutional
provision
necessarily
requires
to
be
talked
about
that
as
well.
i
think
the
history
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no
i
was
about
mr.
chief
justice
to
discuss
that
very
point.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
second
flast
test
is
of
course
the
question
of
whether
the
taxpayer
has
stated
a
relationship
and
nexus
between
themselves
and
the
constitutional
provision.
and
as
our
position
is
you
just
suggested,
it
might
be
mr.
chief
justice,
that
in
fact
this
provision
is
designed
toward
the
protection
of
congress.
it's
designed
to
give
congress
control
over
executive
spending
to
find
out
what
the
executive
is
spending
and
what
the
executive
is
receiving.
i
think
that’s
apparent
both
from
the
history
of
the
statute
although
the
history
is
not
free
from
ambiguity
in
all
candor,
but
i
think
is
even
more
apparent
from
the
necessary
construction
of
this
clause
in
connection
with
other
clauses.
in
the
history,
the
history
is
set
forth
in
our
brief,
the
opposition
of
george
mason
and
patrick
henry
to
this
clause
of
the
constitution
was
apparently
founded
upon
the
fact
that
it
might
allow
secrecy
and
expend
some
accounts.
in
addition
to
that
in
a
phrase
which
is
perhaps
not
entirely
free
from
bad
ambiguity,
but
i
think
it
supports
the
government’s
position
here.
in
the
debate
in
the
constitutional
convention
on
this
clause
in
september
14
which
is
reported
in
2
farrand's
records
at
page
619.
james
wilson
of
pennsylvania
supported
the
motion
to
change
the
provision
before
them
from
an
accounting
year-by-year
in
annual
accounting
to
an
accounting
from
time-to-time
which
is
the
present
language
in
the
clause,
by
saying
that
many
operations
of
finance
cannot
be
properly
published
at
certain
times.
but
i
think
we
rely
unless
upon
that
history
which
i
think
is
incomplete
than
we
do
upon
two
other
factors.
one
is,
but
after
that
history
it
became
regular
practice
for
the
congress
to
keep
some
appropriations
secret
when
the
occasion
of
the
national
interest
seem
to
demand
it.
our
brief
at
page
26
points
to
the
fact
that
there
was
secret
appropriation
in
1811
to
$100,000.00
i
believe
for
the
occupation
of
spanish
florida
an
act
by
the
congress
which
obviously
had
a
great
deal
of
sensitivity
in
foreign
affairs.
that
appropriation
was
kept
secret
for
seven
years
until
1818
when
it
was
published
and
of
course
the
most
famous
example
of
this
kind
of
procedure
was
the
$2
billion
secretly
spent
to
develop
the
atom
bomb
in
the
manhattan
project
during
world
war
ii.
so
i
think
there
is
a
course
to
the
historic
practice
which
supports
the
idea
that
this
is
--
the
reporting
is
in
the
control
of
congress
and
its
intended
to
give
congress
control
over
what
the
executive
is
doing
with
funds.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
wouldn’t
think
so.
there
are
a
number
of
things
in
the
constitution,
i
think
which
give
powers
exclusively
to
congress
and
are
for
the
benefit
of
congress
and
not
for
the
benefit
of
others.
the
power
to
expel
members,
the
power
to
pass
on
for
the
qualifications
and
a
variety
of
others.
i
don’t
think
every
constitutional
provision
is
because
it
is
a
constitutional
provision
necessarily
designed
to
be
enforced
by
the
citizens.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
entirely
true
mr.
justice
stewart
by
hypothesis.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
entirely
true.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that’s
entirely
true.
the
question
always
is,
is
it
enforceable
by
every
member
of
the
public
and
our
position
here
is
that
this
is
a
provision
enforceable
by
congress
and
waivable
by
congress
and
not
enforceable
by
every
citizen
who
may
object
to
the
way
congress
enforces
it.
if
he
does
object
to
the
way
congress
enforces,
i
think
his
clear
remedy
is
to
deal
with
congress
and
try
--
if
he
wants
the
cia
budget
published,
the
simple
matter
is
to
go
to
a
congressman
and
go
to
his
congress
and
get
other
like-minded
citizens
to
get
congress
to
require
that
the
cia
be
--
budget
be
published.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
but
i
think
from
other
aspect
of
this
derived
from
the
consideration
of
the
structure
which
the
constitution
puts
together
in
the
case
that,
that
is
the
correct
reading
of
this
clause.
it'd
be
exceedingly
strange
just
in
passing
if
the
framers
had
believed
they
would
never
be
matters
relating
to
foreign
affairs
and
never
be
matters
relating
to
military
affairs
and
military
intelligence
that
must
not
be
disclosed
to
the
world
in
full.
that’s
--
that
would
be
attributing
to
the
framers
a
lack
of
practicality
which
i
don’t
think
we
may
attribute
to
them.
now,
the
respondent’s
brief
attempts
to
find
the
negative
pregnant
in
the
fact
that
the
constitution
explicitly
authorizes
in
article
i,
section
5,
clause
3,
each
house
to
keep
secret
its
debates
and
decisions
on
matters
that
it
believes
require
secrecy
and
respondent
argues
that
see
they
knew
how
to
provide
for
secrecy
when
it
was
called
for
and
the
fact
that
they
did
not
provide
for
it
in
the
statement
and
accounts
clause,
explicitly
means
that
it
doesn’t
exist,
power
of
confidentiality
does
not
exist.
i
think
the
necessary
inference
runs
quite
the
other
way.
it
would
be
extraordinary
if
the
framers
had
intended
the
house
in
the
senate
to
be
able
to
keep
secret
matters
which
they
regarded
as
sensitive,
but
at
the
same
time
required
the
executive
to
publish
those
same
matters
to
the
world.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
mr.
chief
justice
i
hope
it’s
not
because
i
cannot
answer
the
question.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
have
not
--
i
have
heard
those
complaints,
i
have
not
inquired
into
the
details
here.
perhaps,
i
should
say
something
that
question
brings
to
mind
and
that
is
that
these
matters,
the
cia
funding
is
not
kept
secret
entirely
from
congress.
obviously,
the
matter
is
sensitive.
the
appropriation’s
committees
of
both
the
house
and
the
senate
have
sub-committees
to
which
the
cia
budget
and
expenditures
are
reported
and
from
time-to-time
in
the
senate
there
is
joint
membership
between
the
armed
services
committee
and
the
budget
committee.
so
there
is
a
congressional
check
on
this
process.
it
is
just
that
it
is
deemed
wise
i
suppose
that
matters
of
this
sensitivity
not
be
given
to
bodies
of
the
size
of
the
full
house
and
the
full
senate.
i
think
then
it
is
fairly
plain
i
think
that
the
respondents
claim
the
standing
as
a
taxpayer
doesn’t
meet
either
first
or
the
second
flast
test
requiring
a
logical
nexus
between
his
status
and
enactment
and
his
status
in
the
constitution.
when
you
think
about
--
when
i
think
about
his
claim
to
standing
here,
it
seems
to
me
that
he'd
be
indistinguishable
from
the
claim
to
standing
made
in
ex
parte
levitt
where
a
citizen
and
a
member
the
bar
of
this
court
filed
a
motion
requiring,
asking
that
mr.
justice
black
be
required
to
show
cause
why
he
should
not
be
disqualified
to
be
a
member
of
this
court
because
of
article
i,
section
6,
clause
2.
and
the
court
thought
so
little
of
that
claim
that
they
dismissed
with
per
curiam
opinion
saying
that
they
did
not
sit
to
discuss
generalized
grievances
about
the
way
the
government
is
operating.
i
think
this
case
is
also
indistinguishable
from
laird
against
tatum.
that
was
a
case
in
which
there
was
a
citizen
interest
in
the
possible
chilling
effect
in
army
intelligence
system
though
there
was
no
direct
impact
upon
the
plaintiffs.
and
they
were
denied
standing,
the
case
is
already
standing
case
that
cites
ex
parte
levitt
for
its
main
holding.
i
would
think
that
citizens
in
general
would
have
as
much
interest
in
the
possible
and
alleged
chilling
effect
from
an
army
surveillance
system
upon
first
amendment
values
as
citizen
if
in
general
would
have
here
upon
the
reporting
of
the
cia
budget.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
ex
parte
levitt,
mr.
justice
stewart
is
found
at
302
u.s.
633.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
so
i
think
the
laird
v.
tatum
is
also
a
direct
holding
and
a
more
recent
one,
laird
than
ex
parte
levitt,
that
there
is
no
standing
in
this
case,
i
think
i
should
say
why
i
think
it’s
important,
why
i
think
standing
is
much
more
than
a
rule
of
judicial
self-restraint
or
discretionary
rule
as
the
respondent’s
brief
puts
it
and
as
some
of
the
cases
put
it,
i
think
it
is.
we
can
see
what
the
standing
here
is
in
article
iii
doctrine.
it's
a
doctrine
relates
fundamentally
to
the
way
that
this
court
and
the
lower
federal
courts
(inaudible)
in
judicial
review.
it
is
usually
said
that
standing
isn’t
an
issue
of
whether
the
party
is
a
proper
one.
whereas
justiciability
is
an
issue,
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
issue
was
one
that’s
suitable
for
a
court
to
handle.
i
think
that
it
is
not
put
it
quite
accurately.
i
think
standing
is
a
branch
of
justiciability
because
it
goes
--
it
examines
the
party
only
to
discover
whether
he
is
a
party
who
will
put
the
issue
in
the
forum,
in
a
forum
which
is
suitable
for
judicial
resolution.
and
that
makes
it
i
think
an
aspect
or
a
subdivision
of
justiciability
and
i
think
the
flast
opinion
agrees
that
indeed
it
is
an
aspect
of
justiciability,
it
is
an
article
iii
doctrine.
it
has
also
said
that
the
doctrine
one
having
to
do
with
whether
the
issue
will
be
presented
by
sufficient
adverseness.
i
suppose
extending
standing
to
all
citizens
might
require
--
might
result
in
the
decline
in
the
vigor
of
adversary
presentation
in
some
cases,
it
is
also
necessary
to
admit
that
it
will
not
in
many
because
citizen
standing
will
be
used
often
by
persons
with
ideological
interests
or
groups
with
ideological
interests
who
will
press
the
case
with
great
vigor.
so,
i
am
not
so
sure
that
the
decline
in
vigor
presentation
is
a
general
problem,
although
it
maybe
in
some
cases.
what
standing
and
the
requirement
of
an
injury
in
fact
actually
does
is
delay
the
presentation
of
the
issue
to
the
court
until
the
law
challenged
has
some
actual
impact
upon
members
of
the
society
and
i
think
that’s
important
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
one
is
that
we
ought
to
examine
cases,
the
courts
ought
to
examine
cases
in
concrete
factual
settings
because
our
constitutional
law
too
is
law
that
has
a
common
law
tradition.
a
common
law
of
jurisprudence
and
we
like
to
concrete
factual
settings
because
they
qualify
the
rules
announced
in
the
cases.
they
explained
the
meanings
of
the
rule
to
people
who
must
read
the
cases
and
they
help
the
court
in
imagining
the
difficulties
they
can
get
into
with
a
particular
rule
because
it
is
presented
with
factual
situations
that
indicate
the
complexities
that
are
involved.
so
the
standing
issue
aside
from
being
--
it
is
also
has
an
aspect
of
fairness
to
parties
who
maybe
interested.
that
is
a
party
may
have
a
specific
injury
done
to
him
and
a
rule
of
citizen
or
taxpayer
standing
might
result
in
somebody
who
does
not
have
such
interests
or
a
factual
setting
getting
to
the
courts
first
with
this
case
and
perhaps
resulting
in
a
rule
that
would
not
have
been
arrived
or
not
arrived
at
in
precisely
that
form,
had
a
person
with
a
real
person's
stake
had
been
in
the
case.
but
primary,
i
think
the
concept
is
important
as
a
rule
of
fairness
to
the
court.
i
think
not
just
fairness
to
the
court,
but
the
ability
of
the
court
to
perform
the
awesome
function
of
judicial
review
with
maximum
effectiveness
sanction.
where
there
is
citizen
standing
and
taxpayer
standing,
generally,
is
quite
plain
i
think
that
we
would
have
an
increased
number
of
groups
and
persons
who
would
attack
the
statutes
the
moment
they
were
enacted.
who
would
attack
executive
programs
the
moment
they
were
announced
and
having
standing,
they
would
find
themselves
in
court
debating
abstract
theorems
instantly.
there
are
two
things
wrong
with
that.
i
have
already
discussed
i
think
what’s
wrong
with
that
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
the
issues
are
not
quite
well
without
a
concrete
factual
setting.
but
there’s
also
something
wrong
with
ideological
litigation
in
that
lawyers
in
such
litigation
often
do
not
explore
the
issues
fully.
they
are
looking
for
a
sweeping
constitutional
result
and
are
likely
not
to
explore
narrow
or
statutory
or
factual
problems
that
maybe
quite
important
to
the
court.
whereas
a
person
with
a
personal
stake
wants
to
win
the
case
and
will
explore
every
ground
upon
which
he
might
win
that
case.
this
kind
of
standing
which
would
come
immediately
after
a
law
has
passed
or
statute
or
executive
action
announced
means
that
the
court
at
the
behest
of
such
a
litigant
and
ideological
litigant
does
not
want
to
explore
all
the
concrete
settings,
in
fact
there
is
no
concrete
setting,
would
in
effect
repeat
the
legislative
or
executive
decision
making
process
that
had
just
concluded
and
would
probably
repeat
it
with
fewer
materials
than
were
available
to
the
legislature
and
to
the
executive
in
arriving
at
the
decision,
i
don’t
think
that,
that
is
the
court’s
test
in
the
system
of
judicial
review.
it
makes
the
court
into
something
like
the
counsel
of
revision,
the
framers
rejected.
it
puts
the
court
in
something
of
the
position
of
giving
advisory
opinions
and
i
think
that
would
be
most
unfortunate
for
the
function
of
this
court.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
don’t
know
the
authority.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
our
brief
or
in
our
petition
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
i
am
having
difficulty
at
moment
locating
the
footnote.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
we
did
say
that
there
was
only
some
doubt,
probably
it
was
incorrect,
but
in
this
case
we
do
not
make
a
big
point.

robert
h.

mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh!
i
think
it
was
entirely
correct
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
district
court
dismissed
on
both
grounds
of
standing
and
political
question.
the
court
of
appeals
sitting
en
banc
addressed
only
the
standing
issue
because
it
thought
it
that
the
political
question
issue
was
so
entwined,
intertwined
with
the
merits
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
or
to
the
district
court
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
think
that
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
that
the
political
question
issue
could
be
resolved
much
more
effectively
if
we
were
into
the
full
merits
of
the
case
than
we
can
at
this
stage.
i
think
standing
is
all
that
really
can
be
effectively
discussed
in
the
posture
of
the
case
is
in
now.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
in
the
sense
that
if
--
i
suppose
it
did
in
the
sense
that
it
said
political
question
was
not
properly
considered
until
we
got
to
the
merits.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes
it
was
mr.
justice
white,
but
not
on
the
ground
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
about
political
question
but
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
would
be
the
merits,
we
have
to
reached
the
question
of
whether
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
the
meaning
of
article
i,
clause
--
section
7
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it’s
little
hard
to
tell
mr.
chief
justice
exactly
what
the
district
court’s
reasoning
process
was
because
the
order
and
memorandum
did
not
it
spell
it
out
very
well.
perhaps,
he
thought
that
when
he
said
it
was
a
political
question.
no,
i
do
not
think
that
when
he
said
that
he
thought
he
was
construing
article
i.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
true
and
i
am
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
on
the
separate
point
at
this
stage,
i
am
--
the
flast
tests
drive
one
into
a
consideration
of
what
that
--
i
suppose
i
am
saying
the
same
(voice
overlap).
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that
there
maybe
more
to
the
political
question
doctrine
than
that
and
i
would
certainly
like
a
chance
to
explore
it
below
if
we
--
while
the
standing
here
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
since
the
third
circuit
is
already
ruled
mr.
justice
brennan
that
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
they
have
said
that
the
–
that
it’s
not
appropriate
in
this
forum
to
discuss
political
question
because
you
have
to
go
fully
into
the
meaning
of
the
clause
in
question
into
the
merits
in
order
to
get
the
political
question.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
not
mr.
chief
justice.
