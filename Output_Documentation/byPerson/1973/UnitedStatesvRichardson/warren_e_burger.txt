chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
72-885,
william
v.
richardson.
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
congress
could
require
them
to
render
an
account
down
to
the
last
postage
stamp
if
they
wanted,
could
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
isn’t
the
issue
in
this
case,
who
is
to
define
what
is
a
regular
statement
and
account
under
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
whether
it’s
congress
or
whether
it’s
the
court
or
someone
else?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
we
need
to
get
to
that
at
all
that’s
the
point,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
we
reach
that,
are
you
suggesting
that
it’s
not
necessary
to
reach
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
you're
own
schedule
mr.
solicitor
general.[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
practice
now?
i
am
not
very
clear
on
it
with
reference
to
publishing
details
of
the
expenses
of
the
operation
of
the
congress
itself
and
perhaps
it’s
not
relevant?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
impression
that
there
are
complaints
from
time-to-time
and
others
by
various
people
that
congress
does
not
ever
publish
any
account
on
the
detailed
expenditures?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
you
have
pointed
out
that
it
made
no
difference
in
the
end
result.
but
there
was
some
doubt
perhaps
about
a
district
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
the
motion
to
dismiss
properly
raise
the
issue
of
justiciability?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
resolution
of
that
be
resolution
on
the
merits
even
if
he
didn’t
go
to
the
--
on
the
justiciability
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
fraenkel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
mr.
fraenkel
that
there
would
be
the
same
standing
and
the
same
justiciability
in
a
claim
brought
to
--
by
a
taxpayer,
your
client
for
a
full
statement
of
account
receipts
and
disbursements
on
the
building
of
the
rayburn
building
for
example?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
am
puzzled
then,
why
you
should
have
any
difficulty
with
the
costs
of
the
rayburn
building
mr.
fraenkel?
there
is
no
basis
for
confidentiality
or
any
public
policy
to
be
served
by
that,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
shouldn’t
you
be
able
to
get
it?
why
should
your
client
be
able
to
get
that
if
he
wanted
it?
perhaps
you
could
(voice
overlap)
and
i
am
not
sure
how
relevant
it
is,
but
i
was
just
wondering
why
the
clause
does
not
reach
the
congress
and
the
courts
as
well
as
the
executive
branch?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
clause.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
we
will
resume
there
after
lunch.[luncheon
recess]
mr.
fraenkel,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
come
back
if
i
may
for
a
moment
to
the
levitt
case.
it
would
certainly
be
considerably
more
than
academic
interest
to
the
bar
and
to
the
public
if
one
member
of
the
court
was
not
a
lawful
member
of
the
court
when
it
came
either
to
the
problem
of
grants
of
writs
in
the
presente
or
in
five
to
four
decisions,
would
that
give
a
degree
of
the
concreteness?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
similarly
the
--
at
least
the
claim
of
the
government
who
would
be
undoubtedly
be
if
it
isn't
already
that
the
constitutional
clause
and
question
here
has
been
implemented
by
congress
by
a
statute
tender
a
general
rather
than
a
detailed
annual
account
or
periodic
account?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
fraenkel
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
know?
i
do
not
know,
or
perhaps
you
do
whether
at
present
there
is
a
detailed
account
filed
by
the
atomic
energy
commission
on
all
its
expenditures
and
what
it’s
--
how
much
it’s
spending?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
is
a
special
oversight
committee
of
the
congress,
is
there
not,
which
does
have
access
to
all
the
details.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
after
he
has,
but
suppose
mr.
fraenkel
he
got
everything
that
you
think
he
ought
to
have
and
you
were
satisfied
with
it,
then
what?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
does
he
do
with
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
such
as
what?
(voice

kind
of
action.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
fraenkel.
mr.
bork,
you
have
a
few
minutes
left
if
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
thank
you
mr.
fraenkel,
mr.
solicitor
general.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
disposition
to
announce
in
72-885,
united
states
against
richardson,
the
case
involving
the
question
on
the
standing
to
bring
a
suit
to
the
federal
courts.
for
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
filed
today,
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
under
review
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
together
with
dissent
in
a
related
case
to
be
announced.
mr.

stewart,
with
whom
mr.

also
filed
a
