mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
solicitor
general
has
towards
the
end
of
his
argument
raised
a
man
of
straw.
we
are
not
claiming
here
that
standing
should
be
abolished
and
we
agree
with
that
portion
of
the
solicitor
general’s
argument
that
it
is
composed
of
two
elements.
one,
a
constitutional
element
resting
on
this
case
and
controversy
clause
and
the
other
on
what
this
court
has
itself
described
as
a
discretionary
element
in
order
perhaps
to
limit
the
kind
of
cases
that
come
to
the
court.
in
passing,
i
perhaps
should
object
to
the
reflection
placed
upon
what
my
delightful
friend
called
ideological
lawyers
as
confusing
issues,
i
don’t
think
that
is
a
fair
description
of
their
function.
i
think
ideological
lawyers
have
done
a
great
deal
in
the
past
to
help
this
court
reach
understanding
of
the
problems
raised
by
the
bill
of
rights
particularly,
but
that’s
not
this
case.
we
submit
that
in
this
case
both
tests
are
met.
what
plaintiff
sought
here
was
a
compliance
with
the
constitution
by
the
inclusion
in
the
published
reports
of
some
reference
at
least
to
the
finances
of
the
cia.
that’s
what
he
asks
for
and
that
was
what
was
refused
of
him
and
we
submit
the
fact
is
a
case
on
controversy.
he
was
seeking
information
from
the
government.
now,
clearly
if
that
information
had
been
denied
him
we'll
say
because
he
was
a
member
of
some
minority
group
or
was
politically
just
faithful
to
the
administration,
information
otherwise
available,
clearly
the
courts
would
have
the
right
to
pass
on
that.
and
if
congress
had
passed
the
law
denying
information
on
that
score,
clearly
this
court
could
pass
on
that
law.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no.
no,
i
will
agree
that
there
must
be
some
discretion
vested
somewhere
as
to
the
nature
of
the
details,
but
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
information
may
be
categorized,
it’s
another
thing
to
say
that
congress
can
by
law
take
out
of
what
the
constitution
says
the
public
is
entitled
to
have.
and
the
question
of
this
court
will
have
to
consider
therefore
when
we
come
back
from
lunch
is
to
what
extent
the
constitutional
provision
does
require
some
accounting
by
every
branch
of
government,
bearing
in
mind
as
the
history
shows
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
both
in
the
convention
and
in
the
state
conventions
which
considered
it
later,
recognized
that
there
might
be
delay
in
publication
of
certain
sensitive
matters
as
of
course
was
the
case
with
the
two
instances
mentioned
by
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
but
i
don’t
say
that
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
oh,
i
think
that
congress
reaches
all
agencies
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
because
it
reaches
all
agencies
of
the
government.
but
the
question
which
mr.
chief
justice
you
have
just
raised
as
to
what
extent
the
particular
details
as
for
instance
whether
it
would
be
necessary
to
publish
every
appropriation
made
for
every
employee
in
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
to
come
back
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice,
i
suppose
if
we
come
to
the
merits
of
this
case
as
i
think
if
i
am
correct
on
my
issue
of
standing
the
district
court
will
come
to
as
to
justice
rehnquist's
question
earlier,
i
think
that
will
go
back
to
the
district
court.
then
the
question
will
arise
what
constitutionally
can
congress
do
in
fulfilling
the
mandate
of
the
constitution?
and
i
would
suppose
there
would
be
some
room
for
discretion
as
to
details,
but
not
as
to
categories.
in
other
words,
if
the
public
is
as
we
believe
entitled
under
the
constitution
to
public
information
about
what
the
government
does,
that
at
least
has
to
be
outlined
in
broad
terms
and
no
department
of
government
can
in
our
view
be
constitutionally
excluded
from
the
detailed
account.
now,
how
detailed
that
would
be,
i
don’t
think
it
becomes
the
constitutional
question.
the
solicitor
general
has
relied
on
basically
three
cases.
first,
he
says
we
are
doing
by
flast.
well,
we
don’t
read
flast
that
way.
now
it
is
true
of
course
that
there
is
language
in
flast
written
with
an
eye
to
the
particular
problem
that
was
presented
by
flast.
and
that
language
has
to
be
construed
in
relation
to
that
problem
which
did
arise
under
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
and
when
the
court
talked
about
that
as
being
the
consideration,
of
course
it
was
the
consideration.
well,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
court
intended
to
say
that
that’s
the
only
thing
which
a
taxpayer
could
ever
challenge.
certainly
the
levitt
case
has
no
bearing
on
this,
whatever,
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
levitt
case
to
indicate
any
connection
between
the
individual
who
brought
the
proceeding
and
the
appointment
of
mr.
justice
black.
whereas
here,
there
is
a
direct
connection
between
the
individual
who
brought
the
suit
and
the
refusal
to
give
him
the
information
which
he
claimed
he
was
entitled
to
under
the
constitution.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes!
and
there
are
many
other
questions
which
as
has
been
pointed
it
out
for
instance
the
guarantee
of
the
republican
form
of
government
which
every
individual
citizen
is
interested
in,
that
which
can
probably
become
a
subject
of
litigation.
only
when
because
of
the
denial
of
that
form
of
government
by
some
state,
the
individual
is
subjected
to
impediments
which
the
bill
of
rights
protects
him
against
and
he
would
then
have
a
rest.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that’s
true
and
that
of
course
brings
us
to
the
question
which
i
do
not
think
can
be
decided
or
should
be
decided
here.
whether
this
provision
of
the
constitution
is
purely
political
which
was
one
of
the
grounds
of
the
district
court’s
dismissal.
i
don’t
think
we
need
reach
that
point
or
should
reach
that
point
because
it
is
unnecessary
for
a
resolution
of
the
standing
question
if
my
view
as
correct,
that
a
request
for
information
which
is
supposedly
granted
by
the
constitution
dies
create
a
judicial
basis
and
that
is
all
the
standing
really
amounts
to.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
would
say
that
i
suppose
it’s
a
matter
general
interest
to
the
public
of
this
country
whether
one
of
our
present
executives
could
be
subject
to
impeachment
perhaps,
but
i
don’t
think
anyone
could
contend
that
the
individual
could
bring
a
proceeding
towards
that
end.
because
the
constitution
provides
that
congress
shall
determine
that
and
the
constitution
provides
that
a
justice
of
this
this
court
shall
be
approved
by
the
senate
and
having
been
appointed
by
the
president
and
approved
by
the
senate,
the
constitutional
provisions
have
been
complied
with,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
a
particular
statute
which
we
say
congress
had
no
power
to
enact
because
excluded,
it
didn’t
merely
describe
categories,
but
it
is
excluded
an
important
organ
of
government
from
any
disclosure.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
i
would
say
that
if
the
constitution
--
provision
of
the
constitution
that
we
are
now
considering
said
that
the
accounts
of
agencies
of
the
government
shall
be
published
to
the
extent
that
congress
may
provide.
then
of
course
congress’
decision
could
not
be
subjected
in
the
way
that
we
are
attacking
here.
but
it
didn’t
and
therefore
it
begs
the
question
to
say
that
congress
had
the
power
to
exclude
an
agency
of
government
that’s
what
this
court
has
decided,
that’s
the
issue,
and
it
wasn’t
in
my
opinion
anything
like
such
an
issue
in
levitt.
and
then
laird
against
tatum
was
cited,
but
of
course
in
laird
against
tatum,
this
court
was
very
careful
to
point
out
that
the
particular
plaintiffs
did
not
show
any
injury
to
themselves
as
in
the
sierra
case
for
instance,
leaving
open
clearly
the
possibility
that
other
persons
who
might
be
affected
either
by
this
surveillance
of
the
army
or
by
environmental
disturbances
would
have
standing.
now
that
is
not
the
situation
here.
no
one
would
have
any
special
standing
here
than
this
plaintiff
and
this
court
has
on
a
number
of
occasions
stated
that
standing
can
arise
because
of
the
circumstance
that
no
one
else
could
raise
the
issue.
for
instance,
in
the
rhode
island
so
called
censorship
case,
this
court
expressly
said
that
the
booksellers
there
who
were
not
directly
affected
had
standing
because
otherwise
the
basic
issues
of
freedom
of
speech
involved
might
never
be
presented
to
the
court
and
of
course
the
same
was
true
in
naacp
against
alabama
and
in
barrows
where
the
question
arose
as
to
the
impact
of
a
restricted
covenant
whether
a
white
person
could
raise
the
issue
that
such
a
covenant
discriminated
against
negroes.
this
court
ruled,
he
could
because
otherwise
that
issue
could
not
be
raise
at
all.
so
we
come
back
then
to
the
basic
issue
here
is
right
to
know
important,
not
only
to
a
taxpayer
but
to
a
citizen.
and
i
think
that
recent
events
in
this
country
have
clearly
demonstrated
how
important
it
is
for
the
people
of
this
country
to
know
what
their
government
is
doing.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
think
that
in
time
of
war
many
considerations
exist
which
do
not
otherwise.
certainly
troop
movements
can
be
kept
secret
from
the
press,
various
things
of
that
kinds
are
tolerated
in
time
of
war
which
would
not
be
tolerated
in
time
of
peace.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
of
course
it’s
important
to
say
have
information.
the
question
of
course
is
how
much
of
that
information
can
legitimately
be
kept
secret
from
the
people.
and
then
maybe
a
period
of
time
during
which
it
can
properly
be
kept
secret
as
i
think
was
recognized
by
some
of
the
discussions
in
the
conventions
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
but
we’re
dealing
here
with
an
agency
which
had
been
in
existence
now
for
some
25
years.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
of
course
there
are
also
specific
appropriations
enacted
by
the
congress
for
particular
agencies
of
government
which
are
public
acts
and
therefore
available
to
the
public.
as
far
as
the
cia
is
concerned
there
is
no
such
general
appropriations
act
to
see
appropriations
come
from
other
agencies
of
government
and
are
hint
and
that
is
the
thing
that
we
say
congress
should
--
had
no
right
to
do.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
we
could
lose
in
the
court
below
said
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
we
can
lose
on
the
merits
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
we
could
lose
on
the
merits
certainly.
i
might
point
out
that
the
plaintiff
here
asks
this
court
to
review
while
this
case
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
bring
up
the
merits
right
away
and
this
court
refused.
of
course
we
could
loose
on
the
merits.
we
have
not
argued
the
merits
fully.
we
just
touched
on
it
because
the
other
side
discussed
it
at
some
length
but
that
is
true
of
almost
any
standing
case.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
if
you
being
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
of
course
this
court
has
the
--
i
am
at
loss
to
find
the
right
word
to
say
the
privilege
may
i
say,
of
deciding
anything
that
this
court
thinks
should
be
decided,
that’s
happened
before.
i
just
don’t
think
it
need
be
decided.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
you
are
affirming
that
judgment,
the
two
questions
are
closely
intertwined
and
should
be
reconsidered
by
the
district
court
in
that
light.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes,
i
would
say
so.
of
course
if
this
court
thinks
that
the
case
is
so
clear
that
there
can
be
no
possible
recovery
on
the
merits
because
this
is
obviously
a
political
question.
i
assume
this
court
will
in
this
best
judgment
say
so.
i
don’t
think
it
should,
i
don’t
think
it
need
to
and
it
seems
this
court
on
the
whole
tries
to
avoid
things
it
doesn’t
need
to
do.
i
suggest
we
stick
to
the
question
of
standing.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
you
can
say
it.
you
don’t
need
to
say
it
affirming
the
judgment
would
accomplish
the
same
result
while
saying
it
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
every
time
a
judgment
is
affirmed
you
decide
that
lower
was
correct.
sometimes
you
do
without
saying
anything.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
it’s
not
necessary,
i
think
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that’s
right.
well,
the
judgment
is
affirmed
of
course
the
judgment
is
one
remanding
the
matter
to
the
district
court
for
further
consideration
of
the
whole
issue.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
i
assume
that
if
the
question
is
purely
political
then
the
court
will
say,
no
one
has
standing
to
raise
it.
that
was
of
course
the
situation
for
a
long
time
with
the
question
of
challenges
to
reapportionments.
this
court
said
for
a
long
time
that
that
was
a
political
question
that
was
the
end
of
it.
then
came
baker
against
carr
and
its
progeny
and
there
this
--
for
the
first
really
modern
decision
this
court
pointed
out
what
standing
meant.
and
it
said
that
standing
involved
two
things,
the
constitutional
question
of
case
of
controversy
and
whether
or
not
the
individual
really
was
sufficiently
involved
and
of
course
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes,
but
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
no,
no.
i
said
it
was
the
first.
the
first,
well
it
was
a
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
that
was
the
impression
i
think
that
the
bar
had
it
at
that
time,
but
in
any
case
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
in
any
case
--
there
are
certain
issues
which
i
assume
are
so
attenuous
that
can
be
formulated
with
such
difficulty
in
legal
litigating
terms
as
for
instance
the
question
of
the
guarantee
of
the
republican
form
of
government.
that
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
yes
i
know.
after
all
there
--
there
was
a
denial
of
due
process
very
simply.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
but
it
was
taking
--
it
was
taking
property
without
due
process
of
law
in
effect.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
that
every
violation
of
the
bill
of
rights
could
be
argued
to
be
denial
of
the
republican
form
of
government,
but
in
any
event
to
come
back
to
what
we
considered
to
be
the
elements
here.
a
demand
for
information,
a
refusal
of
that
information,
the
refusal
justified
by
an
act
of
congress
which
on
its
face
at
least
--
there
is
to
apply
in
the
face
of
a
direct
command
of
the
constitution.
it’s
hard
to
say
how
that
can
be
any
clearer
case
of
a
person
having
an
interest
in
obtaining
important
information.
now,
it
is
said
by
my
opponents
that
he
doesn’t
claim
that
his
tax
moneys
are
directly
involved
as
with
taxpayer
in
flast.
he
claimed
that
is
money
is
being
improperly
expended.
but
of
course,
any
taxpayer
is
interested
vitality
and
knowing
how
his
tax
moneys
are
being
spent
and
in
perhaps
he
knew
the
facts
which
enabled
him
to
make
a
constitutional
challenge.
we
don’t
know
here
whether
the
facts
might
not
disclose
a
basis
for
some
constitutional
challenge
with
respect
to
the
expenditure
of
the
moneys.
but
certainly
a
taxpayer
is
as
much
interest
in
knowing
in
order
to
properly
perform
his
function
as
a
citizen
which
is
involved
as
to
well
being
a
taxpayer.
what
has
happened
in
the
past
in
order
to
determine
how
he
should
act
in
the
future?
the
suggestion
by
the
solicitor
general
that
this
would
open
the
plug
gates
to
all
kinds
of
litigation,
i
submit
is
without
any
justification.
here
is
no
sudden
rushing
into
court
to
get
some
basic
principle
established
the
minute
the
executive
presents
something
or
a
law
has
been
passed.
as
i
said
this
agency
had
been
in
existence
for
25
years.
this
is
a
--
here
is
no
ideological
expedition
into
philosophic
notions.
a
very
practical
matter
of
the
taxpayer
who
wants
to
know
what
has
been
done
with
his
money
claiming
that
under
the
constitution
he
has
a
right
to
know,
claiming
that
congress
has
arbitrarily
interfered
with
that
right
by
an
exclusionary
statute.
whether
the
congress
had
the
right
to
passed
that
exclusionary
statute
is
something
which
the
court
would
will
have
to
determine
on
remand
as
i
think
this
court
will
certainly
hope
it
will
affirm
the
decisions
below.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
maybe
nothing.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
maybe
nothing
and
if
he
satisfied
then
he
need
take
no
further
actions.
it
maybe
that
--
what
he
finds
out
will
disclose
something
which
does
justify
further
action.
that
is
something
which
no
one
seem
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
it
might
turn
out
if
the
cia
had
acted
unconstitutionally
in
some
respects
and
might
result
in
litigation
for
a
declaratory
judgment
to
that
effect.
that
was
as
your
honors
well
know,
a
good
deal
of
discussion
involves
the
possibility
of
the
cia
having
been
involved
in
domestic
surveillance
which
is
beyond
its
supposed
function.
we
don’t
know.
we
might
learn
that’s
why
i
am
hoping
this
court
will
let
us
do.
thank
you.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
solicitor
general
has
towards
the
end
of
his
argument
raised
a
man
of
straw.
we
are
not
claiming
here
that
standing
should
be
abolished
and
we
agree
with
that
portion
of
the
solicitor
general’s
argument
that
it
is
composed
of
two
elements.
one,
a
constitutional
element
resting
on
this
case
and
controversy
clause
and
the
other
on
what
this
court
has
itself
described
as
a
discretionary
element
in
order
perhaps
to
limit
the
kind
of
cases
that
come
to
the
court.
in
passing,
i
perhaps
should
object
to
the
reflection
placed
upon
what
my
delightful
friend
called
ideological
lawyers
as
confusing
issues,
i
don’t
think
that
is
a
fair
description
of
their
function.
i
think
ideological
lawyers
have
done
a
great
deal
in
the
past
to
help
this
court
reach
understanding
of
the
problems
raised
by
the
bill
of
rights
particularly,
but
that’s
not
this
case.
we
submit
that
in
this
case
both
tests
are
met.
what
plaintiff
sought
here
was
a
compliance
with
the
constitution
by
the
inclusion
in
the
published
reports
of
some
reference
at
least
to
the
finances
of
the
cia.
that’s
what
he
asks
for
and
that
was
what
was
refused
of
him
and
we
submit
the
fact
is
a
case
on
controversy.
he
was
seeking
information
from
the
government.
now,
clearly
if
that
information
had
been
denied
him
we'll
say
because
he
was
a
member
of
some
minority
group
or
was
politically
just
faithful
to
the
administration,
information
otherwise
available,
clearly
the
courts
would
have
the
right
to
pass
on
that.
and
if
congress
had
passed
the
law
denying
information
on
that
score,
clearly
this
court
could
pass
on
that
law.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no.
no,
i
will
agree
that
there
must
be
some
discretion
vested
somewhere
as
to
the
nature
of
the
details,
but
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
information
may
be
categorized,
it’s
another
thing
to
say
that
congress
can
by
law
take
out
of
what
the
constitution
says
the
public
is
entitled
to
have.
and
the
question
of
this
court
will
have
to
consider
therefore
when
we
come
back
from
lunch
is
to
what
extent
the
constitutional
provision
does
require
some
accounting
by
every
branch
of
government,
bearing
in
mind
as
the
history
shows
that
the
framers
of
the
constitution
both
in
the
convention
and
in
the
state
conventions
which
considered
it
later,
recognized
that
there
might
be
delay
in
publication
of
certain
sensitive
matters
as
of
course
was
the
case
with
the
two
instances
mentioned
by
the
solicitor
general.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
but
i
don’t
say
that
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
oh,
i
think
that
congress
reaches
all
agencies
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
because
it
reaches
all
agencies
of
the
government.
but
the
question
which
mr.
chief
justice
you
have
just
raised
as
to
what
extent
the
particular
details
as
for
instance
whether
it
would
be
necessary
to
publish
every
appropriation
made
for
every
employee
in
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
to
come
back
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice,
i
suppose
if
we
come
to
the
merits
of
this
case
as
i
think
if
i
am
correct
on
my
issue
of
standing
the
district
court
will
come
to
as
to
justice
rehnquist's
question
earlier,
i
think
that
will
go
back
to
the
district
court.
then
the
question
will
arise
what
constitutionally
can
congress
do
in
fulfilling
the
mandate
of
the
constitution?
and
i
would
suppose
there
would
be
some
room
for
discretion
as
to
details,
but
not
as
to
categories.
in
other
words,
if
the
public
is
as
we
believe
entitled
under
the
constitution
to
public
information
about
what
the
government
does,
that
at
least
has
to
be
outlined
in
broad
terms
and
no
department
of
government
can
in
our
view
be
constitutionally
excluded
from
the
detailed
account.
now,
how
detailed
that
would
be,
i
don’t
think
it
becomes
the
constitutional
question.
the
solicitor
general
has
relied
on
basically
three
cases.
first,
he
says
we
are
doing
by
flast.
well,
we
don’t
read
flast
that
way.
now
it
is
true
of
course
that
there
is
language
in
flast
written
with
an
eye
to
the
particular
problem
that
was
presented
by
flast.
and
that
language
has
to
be
construed
in
relation
to
that
problem
which
did
arise
under
the
establishment
clause
of
the
first
amendment.
and
when
the
court
talked
about
that
as
being
the
consideration,
of
course
it
was
the
consideration.
well,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
court
intended
to
say
that
that’s
the
only
thing
which
a
taxpayer
could
ever
challenge.
certainly
the
levitt
case
has
no
bearing
on
this,
whatever,
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
levitt
case
to
indicate
any
connection
between
the
individual
who
brought
the
proceeding
and
the
appointment
of
mr.
justice
black.
whereas
here,
there
is
a
direct
connection
between
the
individual
who
brought
the
suit
and
the
refusal
to
give
him
the
information
which
he
claimed
he
was
entitled
to
under
the
constitution.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes!
and
there
are
many
other
questions
which
as
has
been
pointed
it
out
for
instance
the
guarantee
of
the
republican
form
of
government
which
every
individual
citizen
is
interested
in,
that
which
can
probably
become
a
subject
of
litigation.
only
when
because
of
the
denial
of
that
form
of
government
by
some
state,
the
individual
is
subjected
to
impediments
which
the
bill
of
rights
protects
him
against
and
he
would
then
have
a
rest.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that’s
true
and
that
of
course
brings
us
to
the
question
which
i
do
not
think
can
be
decided
or
should
be
decided
here.
whether
this
provision
of
the
constitution
is
purely
political
which
was
one
of
the
grounds
of
the
district
court’s
dismissal.
i
don’t
think
we
need
reach
that
point
or
should
reach
that
point
because
it
is
unnecessary
for
a
resolution
of
the
standing
question
if
my
view
as
correct,
that
a
request
for
information
which
is
supposedly
granted
by
the
constitution
dies
create
a
judicial
basis
and
that
is
all
the
standing
really
amounts
to.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
would
say
that
i
suppose
it’s
a
matter
general
interest
to
the
public
of
this
country
whether
one
of
our
present
executives
could
be
subject
to
impeachment
perhaps,
but
i
don’t
think
anyone
could
contend
that
the
individual
could
bring
a
proceeding
towards
that
end.
because
the
constitution
provides
that
congress
shall
determine
that
and
the
constitution
provides
that
a
justice
of
this
this
court
shall
be
approved
by
the
senate
and
having
been
appointed
by
the
president
and
approved
by
the
senate,
the
constitutional
provisions
have
been
complied
with,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
a
particular
statute
which
we
say
congress
had
no
power
to
enact
because
excluded,
it
didn’t
merely
describe
categories,
but
it
is
excluded
an
important
organ
of
government
from
any
disclosure.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
i
would
say
that
if
the
constitution
--
provision
of
the
constitution
that
we
are
now
considering
said
that
the
accounts
of
agencies
of
the
government
shall
be
published
to
the
extent
that
congress
may
provide.
then
of
course
congress’
decision
could
not
be
subjected
in
the
way
that
we
are
attacking
here.
but
it
didn’t
and
therefore
it
begs
the
question
to
say
that
congress
had
the
power
to
exclude
an
agency
of
government
that’s
what
this
court
has
decided,
that’s
the
issue,
and
it
wasn’t
in
my
opinion
anything
like
such
an
issue
in
levitt.
and
then
laird
against
tatum
was
cited,
but
of
course
in
laird
against
tatum,
this
court
was
very
careful
to
point
out
that
the
particular
plaintiffs
did
not
show
any
injury
to
themselves
as
in
the
sierra
case
for
instance,
leaving
open
clearly
the
possibility
that
other
persons
who
might
be
affected
either
by
this
surveillance
of
the
army
or
by
environmental
disturbances
would
have
standing.
now
that
is
not
the
situation
here.
no
one
would
have
any
special
standing
here
than
this
plaintiff
and
this
court
has
on
a
number
of
occasions
stated
that
standing
can
arise
because
of
the
circumstance
that
no
one
else
could
raise
the
issue.
for
instance,
in
the
rhode
island
so
called
censorship
case,
this
court
expressly
said
that
the
booksellers
there
who
were
not
directly
affected
had
standing
because
otherwise
the
basic
issues
of
freedom
of
speech
involved
might
never
be
presented
to
the
court
and
of
course
the
same
was
true
in
naacp
against
alabama
and
in
barrows
where
the
question
arose
as
to
the
impact
of
a
restricted
covenant
whether
a
white
person
could
raise
the
issue
that
such
a
covenant
discriminated
against
negroes.
this
court
ruled,
he
could
because
otherwise
that
issue
could
not
be
raise
at
all.
so
we
come
back
then
to
the
basic
issue
here
is
right
to
know
important,
not
only
to
a
taxpayer
but
to
a
citizen.
and
i
think
that
recent
events
in
this
country
have
clearly
demonstrated
how
important
it
is
for
the
people
of
this
country
to
know
what
their
government
is
doing.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
think
that
in
time
of
war
many
considerations
exist
which
do
not
otherwise.
certainly
troop
movements
can
be
kept
secret
from
the
press,
various
things
of
that
kinds
are
tolerated
in
time
of
war
which
would
not
be
tolerated
in
time
of
peace.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
of
course
it’s
important
to
say
have
information.
the
question
of
course
is
how
much
of
that
information
can
legitimately
be
kept
secret
from
the
people.
and
then
maybe
a
period
of
time
during
which
it
can
properly
be
kept
secret
as
i
think
was
recognized
by
some
of
the
discussions
in
the
conventions
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
the
constitution.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
but
we’re
dealing
here
with
an
agency
which
had
been
in
existence
now
for
some
25
years.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
of
course
there
are
also
specific
appropriations
enacted
by
the
congress
for
particular
agencies
of
government
which
are
public
acts
and
therefore
available
to
the
public.
as
far
as
the
cia
is
concerned
there
is
no
such
general
appropriations
act
to
see
appropriations
come
from
other
agencies
of
government
and
are
hint
and
that
is
the
thing
that
we
say
congress
should
--
had
no
right
to
do.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
we
could
lose
in
the
court
below
said
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
we
can
lose
on
the
merits
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
we
could
lose
on
the
merits
certainly.
i
might
point
out
that
the
plaintiff
here
asks
this
court
to
review
while
this
case
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
bring
up
the
merits
right
away
and
this
court
refused.
of
course
we
could
loose
on
the
merits.
we
have
not
argued
the
merits
fully.
we
just
touched
on
it
because
the
other
side
discussed
it
at
some
length
but
that
is
true
of
almost
any
standing
case.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
if
you
being
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
of
course
this
court
has
the
--
i
am
at
loss
to
find
the
right
word
to
say
the
privilege
may
i
say,
of
deciding
anything
that
this
court
thinks
should
be
decided,
that’s
happened
before.
i
just
don’t
think
it
need
be
decided.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
you
are
affirming
that
judgment,
the
two
questions
are
closely
intertwined
and
should
be
reconsidered
by
the
district
court
in
that
light.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes,
i
would
say
so.
of
course
if
this
court
thinks
that
the
case
is
so
clear
that
there
can
be
no
possible
recovery
on
the
merits
because
this
is
obviously
a
political
question.
i
assume
this
court
will
in
this
best
judgment
say
so.
i
don’t
think
it
should,
i
don’t
think
it
need
to
and
it
seems
this
court
on
the
whole
tries
to
avoid
things
it
doesn’t
need
to
do.
i
suggest
we
stick
to
the
question
of
standing.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
you
can
say
it.
you
don’t
need
to
say
it
affirming
the
judgment
would
accomplish
the
same
result
while
saying
it
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
every
time
a
judgment
is
affirmed
you
decide
that
lower
was
correct.
sometimes
you
do
without
saying
anything.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
it’s
not
necessary,
i
think
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
that’s
right.
well,
the
judgment
is
affirmed
of
course
the
judgment
is
one
remanding
the
matter
to
the
district
court
for
further
consideration
of
the
whole
issue.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
i
assume
that
if
the
question
is
purely
political
then
the
court
will
say,
no
one
has
standing
to
raise
it.
that
was
of
course
the
situation
for
a
long
time
with
the
question
of
challenges
to
reapportionments.
this
court
said
for
a
long
time
that
that
was
a
political
question
that
was
the
end
of
it.
then
came
baker
against
carr
and
its
progeny
and
there
this
--
for
the
first
really
modern
decision
this
court
pointed
out
what
standing
meant.
and
it
said
that
standing
involved
two
things,
the
constitutional
question
of
case
of
controversy
and
whether
or
not
the
individual
really
was
sufficiently
involved
and
of
course
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
yes,
but
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
no,
no,
no.
i
said
it
was
the
first.
the
first,
well
it
was
a
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well
that
was
the
impression
i
think
that
the
bar
had
it
at
that
time,
but
in
any
case
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
in
any
case
--
there
are
certain
issues
which
i
assume
are
so
attenuous
that
can
be
formulated
with
such
difficulty
in
legal
litigating
terms
as
for
instance
the
question
of
the
guarantee
of
the
republican
form
of
government.
that
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
yes
i
know.
after
all
there
--
there
was
a
denial
of
due
process
very
simply.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
but
it
was
taking
--
it
was
taking
property
without
due
process
of
law
in
effect.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
that
every
violation
of
the
bill
of
rights
could
be
argued
to
be
denial
of
the
republican
form
of
government,
but
in
any
event
to
come
back
to
what
we
considered
to
be
the
elements
here.
a
demand
for
information,
a
refusal
of
that
information,
the
refusal
justified
by
an
act
of
congress
which
on
its
face
at
least
--
there
is
to
apply
in
the
face
of
a
direct
command
of
the
constitution.
it’s
hard
to
say
how
that
can
be
any
clearer
case
of
a
person
having
an
interest
in
obtaining
important
information.
now,
it
is
said
by
my
opponents
that
he
doesn’t
claim
that
his
tax
moneys
are
directly
involved
as
with
taxpayer
in
flast.
he
claimed
that
is
money
is
being
improperly
expended.
but
of
course,
any
taxpayer
is
interested
vitality
and
knowing
how
his
tax
moneys
are
being
spent
and
in
perhaps
he
knew
the
facts
which
enabled
him
to
make
a
constitutional
challenge.
we
don’t
know
here
whether
the
facts
might
not
disclose
a
basis
for
some
constitutional
challenge
with
respect
to
the
expenditure
of
the
moneys.
but
certainly
a
taxpayer
is
as
much
interest
in
knowing
in
order
to
properly
perform
his
function
as
a
citizen
which
is
involved
as
to
well
being
a
taxpayer.
what
has
happened
in
the
past
in
order
to
determine
how
he
should
act
in
the
future?
the
suggestion
by
the
solicitor
general
that
this
would
open
the
plug
gates
to
all
kinds
of
litigation,
i
submit
is
without
any
justification.
here
is
no
sudden
rushing
into
court
to
get
some
basic
principle
established
the
minute
the
executive
presents
something
or
a
law
has
been
passed.
as
i
said
this
agency
had
been
in
existence
for
25
years.
this
is
a
--
here
is
no
ideological
expedition
into
philosophic
notions.
a
very
practical
matter
of
the
taxpayer
who
wants
to
know
what
has
been
done
with
his
money
claiming
that
under
the
constitution
he
has
a
right
to
know,
claiming
that
congress
has
arbitrarily
interfered
with
that
right
by
an
exclusionary
statute.
whether
the
congress
had
the
right
to
passed
that
exclusionary
statute
is
something
which
the
court
would
will
have
to
determine
on
remand
as
i
think
this
court
will
certainly
hope
it
will
affirm
the
decisions
below.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
maybe
nothing.
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
maybe
nothing
and
if
he
satisfied
then
he
need
take
no
further
actions.
it
maybe
that
--
what
he
finds
out
will
disclose
something
which
does
justify
further
action.
that
is
something
which
no
one
seem
--
mr.
osmond
k.
fraenkel
well,
it
might
turn
out
if
the
cia
had
acted
unconstitutionally
in
some
respects
and
might
result
in
litigation
for
a
declaratory
judgment
to
that
effect.
that
was
as
your
honors
well
know,
a
good
deal
of
discussion
involves
the
possibility
of
the
cia
having
been
involved
in
domestic
surveillance
which
is
beyond
its
supposed
function.
we
don’t
know.
we
might
learn
that’s
why
i
am
hoping
this
court
will
let
us
do.
thank
you.
