unknown
speaker
mr.
tucker,
was
there
any
fence
around
the
parking
lot?
unknown
speaker
were
there
any
signs
of
“no
trespassing”
or
signs
indicating
that
the
members
of
public
were
not
allowed
to
come
on?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tucker,
was
there
any
evidence
when
it
was
that
western
alfalfa
first
learned
of
the
readings
being
taken
on
june
4th?
unknown
speaker
that
was
issued
without
any
hearing?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
so
called
ambient
air
quality
standard?
unknown
speaker
but
at
a
sized
area?
unknown
speaker
that
a
reading
taken
anywhere
in
the
state
would
be
of
evidentiary
value?
unknown
speaker
and
the
fact
that
he
was
nearby,
it
becomes
irrelevant?
unknown
speaker
except
as
it
might
vary
from
the
accuracy
of
the
reading?
unknown
speaker
who
would
determine
that
standard?
unknown
speaker
were
any
tests
taken,
anywhere
in
the
ambient
area?
unknown
speaker
for
this
violation?
unknown
speaker
that
is
true
with
much
electronic
surveillance.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
a
trespasser,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
no
consent
to
the
entry.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
maintain?
unknown
speaker
if
there
was
an
open
invitation
to
come
on
the
property?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
a
little
different
argument
in
saying
that
this
isn't--
fourth
amendment
doesn't
reach
it,
isn’t
it?
are
you
relying
on
the
consent
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
the
expectation.
if
there
is
no
expectation
of
privacy,
then
fourth
amendment
doesn’t
even
apply.
you
don’t
even
need
to
worry
about
consent.
now,
which
one
you
are
pushing,
both
of
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
no
expectation
privacy,
you
mean
on
that
parking
lot?
for
example
with
this,
will
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
they
have
gone
in
to
one
of
the
buildings
and
made
those
--
unknown
speaker
well
then
you
must
--
then
this
argue
was
based
on
the
fact
that
all
he
did
was
go
to
the
parking
lot.
well
now
whether
is
it
implied
consent
to
go
on
the
parking
lot
and
take
these
tests?
unknown
speaker
where's
that
derived
from?
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
derive
from?
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
inspectors
do
during
those
two
years?
unknown
speaker
and
in
those
two
years
were
all
the
test
--
whatever
the
tests
were
taken
only
on
the
parking
lot?
unknown
speaker
did
you
make
this
argument
to
the
colorado
courts?
unknown
speaker
did
you
argue
within
this
implied
consent
matter?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
your
petition
to
your
supreme
court
didn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
raising
this
fourth
amendment
question?
unknown
speaker
and
argument
--
they
turned
it
down.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
didn’t
argue,
but
you
put
it
in
you
petition
for
review
or
whatever
you
call
this.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
consent?
did
you
argue
that?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tucker
suppose
the
ringelmann
test
tomorrow
were
revised
and
improved
so
that
it
could
be
effected
from
across
the
highway
and
one
didn't
have
to
go
into
the
parking
lot,
would
you
have
a
different
case
at
all?
unknown
speaker
who
was
required
to
take
the
readings?
unknown
speaker
how
long
ordinarily
does
that
training
take?
unknown
speaker
does
this
mean
that
it
is
purely
visual?
unknown
speaker
purely
visual,
no
device
at
all?
unknown
speaker
so,
he
could
have
stood
–
if
he
were
trained
well
enough,
could
have
stood
half
a
mile
away
and
then
able
to
take
the
reading.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
decision
that
the
colorado
court
was
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
violated
or
that
there
was
an
unfair
trial
and
that
there
was
unrebuttable
evidence
presented.
let
us
assume
that
the
inspectors
had
come
on
the
premises,
called
them
up
and
said,
we
are
going
to
come
on
to
inspect
and
they
said
‘stay
off’
and
they
said,
no
we
are
coming
on,
we
just
want
to
let
you
have
notice,
you
can
be
there
with
your
own
machine
if
you
want.
they
went
and
took
the
same
reading
except
that
the
company
was
there
with
its
own
machine.
then
they
have
the
very
same
proceeding
and
the
company
contended
that
they
had
violated
the
fourth
amendment
by
coming
on
the
premises
and
obtaining
this
evidence.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
of
appeals
might
have
come
out
differently.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
read
it?
that
the
lack
of
notice
was
the
fundamental
error
or
what?
unknown
speaker
well
has
the
agency
changed
this
procedure
since
the
decision
of
court
of
appeal?
unknown
speaker
they
are
still
doing
it
the
same
way.
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
then,
you
must
give
a
notice
then
that
you
are
coming.
unknown
speaker
at
least
don't
you
give
a
notice
now
that
inspector
is
coming
to
the
plant?
unknown
speaker
well
then
how?
if
there
is
an
objection,
how
is
it
registered?
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
have
to
stop
and
get
a
warrant
and
do
it
all
over
again,
if
he
objects
that.
unknown
speaker
but
you
get
a
warrant
ex
parte?
unknown
speaker
the
colorado
is
the
only
party.
unknown
speaker
but
the
only
thing
that
is
at
issue
here,
remaining
at
issue
is
this
particular
cease
and
desist
order.
the
validity
of
the
prior
statute
is
not
here
because
as
the
prior
stature
is
gone.
unknown
speaker
but
nevertheless,
the
only
thing
that
is
at
issue
is
that
this
particular
cease
and
desist
order
--
unknown
speaker
and
that
hinges
in
turn
on
the
prior
statute.
unknown
speaker
he
looks
in
direction
of
the
sun,
does
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
how
does
he
know
about
the
light
coming
through
the
smoke,
i
would
think
it
would
be
--
unknown
speaker
source
of
the
light
is
the
sun.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
and
the
observations
were
made
on
the
property.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
it
is
essential
to
go
on
the
property
to
get
and
make
a
proper
observation
--
unknown
speaker
i
understood
there
were
some
pictures
in
the
original
record.
unknown
speaker
the
issue
you
want
to
cite
it,
you
would
like
to
have
one
in
the
property--
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
it
account
any
fourth
amendment
claim?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
the
question
i
asked
–
if
there
had
been
notice
here,
do
you
think
that
would
have
satisfied
any
objections
to
the
court
of
appeal
in
light
of
that?
unknown
speaker
and
that
the
evidence
was
just
excluded.
unknown
speaker
and
your
whole
point
is
that
the
record
simply
does
not
support
an
entry
at
a
place
where
consent
would
be
required.
unknown
speaker
no,
maybe
i
misunderstand
you
mr.
kitch,
you
say
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
except
the
testimony
of
some
witness
or
perhaps
of
the
inspector,
that
he
was
on
the
premises.
unknown
speaker
ultimately,
looking
at
the
pictures
where
the
pictures
were
taken
from
--
unknown
speaker
well
what's
the
concern
of
the
united
states
that
this
is
affirmed?
unknown
speaker
it
was
also
a
due
process
problem
here
which
is
just
kind
of
combined
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
with
the
fourth
amendment
problem.
unknown
speaker
this
observation
was
made
in
a
period,
--
it
was
june
4th
1969
if
that's
the
date
and
under
your
statute
an
emission
of
more
than
the
designated
opacity
for
as
long
as
three
minutes
in
any
hour
is
a
violation.
then
this
whole
charge
was
based
upon
that
particular
day
and
people
in
the
western
alfalfa
corporation
had
no
idea
that
any
--
unknown
speaker
tests
then
being
made
and
then
no
opportunity
to
have
their
own
people
that
--
unknown
speaker
but
the
generally
--
unknown
speaker
generally
these
are
ordinary
--
this
is
the
matter
of
expert
testimony
is
it
not?
this
is
not
an
eye
witness
who
said,
“i
saw
that
man
hit
the
other
man
over
the
head”
or
police
gone
or
whatever.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
where
is
the
radar
here,
it's
just
a
man
and
his
naked
eye.
unknown
speaker
what
has
been
required
i
missed
it?
unknown
speaker
two
kind
of
standards
are
opacity
and
density
or
what's
the
other
one
called?
unknown
speaker
you
see
black
smoke
and
you
say
(inaudible)
smokes
black
--
unknown
speaker
over
a
quite
a
long
period
--
unknown
speaker
that's
called
what
not
density?
unknown
speaker
particulates.
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
opinions
indicates
that
the
western
has
its
own
ringelmann
testimony.
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
says,
western
counted
this
evidence
with
the
ringelmann
readings
taken
by
a
consulting
engineers
hired
by
western
which
showed
no
violation
and
they
also
offered
result
for
the
sophisticated
test
conducted
at
their
plant
by
an
independent
engineering
firm,
some
months
after
they
were
issued
the
cease
and
desist
order.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
first
doesn't
seem
to
be
an
offer,
it
seems
to
be
the
introduction
of
evidence.
unknown
speaker
of
course
they
couldn’t
meet
the
charge,
vis-a-vis,
june
6th
because
they
had
no
idea,
any
test
was
being
made
on
that
day
and
that's
what
the
court
of
appeal
says,
as
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
the
same
objections
though,
would
you,
if
freed
from
fourth
amendment
overtone
--
some
court
would
decide
there
was
a
denial
of
due
process.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
the
federal
statue
seems
to
require
a
presentations
of
credentials.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
same
kind
of
argument
that
is
made
in
every
constitutional
case.
the
argument
of
necessity,
practicality.
and
that
you
can’t
catch
wrong
doors
without
busting
into
their
houses
in
the
middle
of
the
night
without
warrants
and
so
on.
unknown
speaker
the
proceedings
before
the
court,
some
of
the
statements
that
you
made
that
this
has
been
an
ongoing
controversy
between
the
state
authority
and
the
respondent.
unknown
speaker
your
comment
at
the
hearing
that
apparently
respondent
did
not
satisfy
the
ringelmann
requirements,
as
result
of
test
--
i
am
referring
to
page
73?
unknown
speaker
there
are
written
violations
and
visual
violations.
unknown
speaker
and
western
alfalfa
let
that
at
extent
–
from
these
particular
test
and
judging
from
the
testimony
i
heard,
at
the
first
hearing
unless
there
is
some
change
in
the
operation,
i
will
expect
it
to
come
out
and
say
we
are
--
i
mean
this
is
not
surprise.
unknown
speaker
of
all
the
bootleg
establishment,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
do
you
offer
at
any
time
any
evidence
that
the
company
was
complying
with
these
tests
–
do
they
their
own
tests.
unknown
speaker
back
again
to
that
colloquy
on
page
77
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
you
say
that
you
could
not
possibly
–
would
you
say
defense
--
at
that
what
you
had
offered,
whether
it
was
august
or
whatever
date
it
was
that
was
taken,
that
there
was
testimony,
the
conditions
on
the
august
day
were
same
as
june
4
and
therefore
you
had
done
the
best
you
could
with
your
particular
evidence,
it
was
established
that
since
as
of
august,
you
were
in
compliance
and
the
conditions
were
the
same
as
on
june
4.
therefore
the
board
should
take
as
your
defense
left
on
june
4th
you
were
in
compliance,
wasn't
that
it?
unknown
speaker
instantly
getting
back,
another
page
73,
your
discussion
was
a
sort
of
burden
of
proof
thing.
i
am
looking
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
where
you
say
that
you
would
expect
the
staff
to
come
out
and
say
well,
the
ringelmann
violations
and
the
only
the
way
you
will
be
able
effectively
to
defense
against
that
by
making
expensive
particular
tests
--
unknown
speaker
and
make
it
when
as
of
the
same
day
that
the
visual
readings
were
taken.
unknown
speaker
unless
you
knew
about
it.
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
colorado
law,
what's
the
aftermath,
denial
of
the
variance
board,
the
board
denied
the
variance.
unknown
speaker
are
you
denying
this,
you
must
know
your
plans
certainly
or
that
the
plumes
were
visible?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
an
order
issued
denying
a
variance.
unknown
speaker
ignoring
this
premise
point,
the
district
court
in
colorado
overturned
the
administrative
decision,
said
it
wasn’t
even
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
unknown
speaker
the
court
decided
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cawelti,
if
you
feel
so
strongly
that
it
was
a
search,
why
wasn't
this
raised
in
the
colorado
court?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
are
you
familiar
with
the
case
of
united
states
against
lee
decided
about
the
same
advantage
as
hester
a
little
later
probation
era,
where
the
coast
guard
cutter
shined
its
light
on
the
rum
runner?
i
think
that
was
not
a
violation
of
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
the
search
light
on
the
coast
guard
cutter,
they
grain
alcohol
aboard
the
rum
runner.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cowelti,
may
i
ask
with
this
hypothetical
question
to
you?
suppose
that
the
government
had
reason,
let's
say
the
federal
government
had
reason
to
believe
that
some
criminal
activity
was
going
on
in
your
plant’s
building
in
addition
to
its
legitimate
operation.
we
have
talking
about
stales,
let's
assume
they
had
some
reason
to
believe
a
stale
was
being
operated
there.
counterfeit
operation
and
that
an
fbi
agent
had
come
on
to
premises
to
same
extent
as
the
colorado
inspector
did
here
and
taking
photographs
would
your
position
be
the
same?
unknown
speaker
no,
all
that
was
done
was
the
government
wanted
photographs
of
the
building.
instead
of
taking
them
with
a
long
lens
camera
say
from
the
highway
government
officer
stepped
on
the
parking
lot
and
took
pictures
of
the
building
that
was
a
suspect
for
the
possible
--
criminal
operation,
would
the
government
have
committed
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
it
would
have
engaged
in
the
trespass
but
would
the
fourth
amendment
have
been
violated?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
about
the
colonnade
and
biswell?
unknown
speaker
would
that
have
happened
if
the
door
hadn't
been
locked?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
next
case?
unknown
speaker
as
your
petition
for
certiorari
was
granted.
unknown
speaker
alright,
you
are
quite
right.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
mr.
tucker,
was
there
any
fence
around
the
parking
lot?
unknown
speaker
were
there
any
signs
of
“no
trespassing”
or
signs
indicating
that
the
members
of
public
were
not
allowed
to
come
on?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tucker,
was
there
any
evidence
when
it
was
that
western
alfalfa
first
learned
of
the
readings
being
taken
on
june
4th?
unknown
speaker
that
was
issued
without
any
hearing?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
so
called
ambient
air
quality
standard?
unknown
speaker
but
at
a
sized
area?
unknown
speaker
that
a
reading
taken
anywhere
in
the
state
would
be
of
evidentiary
value?
unknown
speaker
and
the
fact
that
he
was
nearby,
it
becomes
irrelevant?
unknown
speaker
except
as
it
might
vary
from
the
accuracy
of
the
reading?
unknown
speaker
who
would
determine
that
standard?
unknown
speaker
were
any
tests
taken,
anywhere
in
the
ambient
area?
unknown
speaker
for
this
violation?
unknown
speaker
that
is
true
with
much
electronic
surveillance.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
a
trespasser,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
no
consent
to
the
entry.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
maintain?
unknown
speaker
if
there
was
an
open
invitation
to
come
on
the
property?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
a
little
different
argument
in
saying
that
this
isn't--
fourth
amendment
doesn't
reach
it,
isn’t
it?
are
you
relying
on
the
consent
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
the
expectation.
if
there
is
no
expectation
of
privacy,
then
fourth
amendment
doesn’t
even
apply.
you
don’t
even
need
to
worry
about
consent.
now,
which
one
you
are
pushing,
both
of
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
no
expectation
privacy,
you
mean
on
that
parking
lot?
for
example
with
this,
will
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
they
have
gone
in
to
one
of
the
buildings
and
made
those
--
unknown
speaker
well
then
you
must
--
then
this
argue
was
based
on
the
fact
that
all
he
did
was
go
to
the
parking
lot.
well
now
whether
is
it
implied
consent
to
go
on
the
parking
lot
and
take
these
tests?
unknown
speaker
where's
that
derived
from?
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
derive
from?
unknown
speaker
what
did
the
inspectors
do
during
those
two
years?
unknown
speaker
and
in
those
two
years
were
all
the
test
--
whatever
the
tests
were
taken
only
on
the
parking
lot?
unknown
speaker
did
you
make
this
argument
to
the
colorado
courts?
unknown
speaker
did
you
argue
within
this
implied
consent
matter?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
your
petition
to
your
supreme
court
didn’t
you?
unknown
speaker
raising
this
fourth
amendment
question?
unknown
speaker
and
argument
--
they
turned
it
down.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
didn’t
argue,
but
you
put
it
in
you
petition
for
review
or
whatever
you
call
this.
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
consent?
did
you
argue
that?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tucker
suppose
the
ringelmann
test
tomorrow
were
revised
and
improved
so
that
it
could
be
effected
from
across
the
highway
and
one
didn't
have
to
go
into
the
parking
lot,
would
you
have
a
different
case
at
all?
unknown
speaker
who
was
required
to
take
the
readings?
unknown
speaker
how
long
ordinarily
does
that
training
take?
unknown
speaker
does
this
mean
that
it
is
purely
visual?
unknown
speaker
purely
visual,
no
device
at
all?
unknown
speaker
so,
he
could
have
stood
–
if
he
were
trained
well
enough,
could
have
stood
half
a
mile
away
and
then
able
to
take
the
reading.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
decision
that
the
colorado
court
was
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
violated
or
that
there
was
an
unfair
trial
and
that
there
was
unrebuttable
evidence
presented.
let
us
assume
that
the
inspectors
had
come
on
the
premises,
called
them
up
and
said,
we
are
going
to
come
on
to
inspect
and
they
said
‘stay
off’
and
they
said,
no
we
are
coming
on,
we
just
want
to
let
you
have
notice,
you
can
be
there
with
your
own
machine
if
you
want.
they
went
and
took
the
same
reading
except
that
the
company
was
there
with
its
own
machine.
then
they
have
the
very
same
proceeding
and
the
company
contended
that
they
had
violated
the
fourth
amendment
by
coming
on
the
premises
and
obtaining
this
evidence.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
of
appeals
might
have
come
out
differently.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
read
it?
that
the
lack
of
notice
was
the
fundamental
error
or
what?
unknown
speaker
well
has
the
agency
changed
this
procedure
since
the
decision
of
court
of
appeal?
unknown
speaker
they
are
still
doing
it
the
same
way.
unknown
speaker
well,
at
least
then,
you
must
give
a
notice
then
that
you
are
coming.
unknown
speaker
at
least
don't
you
give
a
notice
now
that
inspector
is
coming
to
the
plant?
unknown
speaker
well
then
how?
if
there
is
an
objection,
how
is
it
registered?
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
have
to
stop
and
get
a
warrant
and
do
it
all
over
again,
if
he
objects
that.
unknown
speaker
but
you
get
a
warrant
ex
parte?
unknown
speaker
the
colorado
is
the
only
party.
unknown
speaker
but
the
only
thing
that
is
at
issue
here,
remaining
at
issue
is
this
particular
cease
and
desist
order.
the
validity
of
the
prior
statute
is
not
here
because
as
the
prior
stature
is
gone.
unknown
speaker
but
nevertheless,
the
only
thing
that
is
at
issue
is
that
this
particular
cease
and
desist
order
--
unknown
speaker
and
that
hinges
in
turn
on
the
prior
statute.
unknown
speaker
he
looks
in
direction
of
the
sun,
does
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
how
does
he
know
about
the
light
coming
through
the
smoke,
i
would
think
it
would
be
--
unknown
speaker
source
of
the
light
is
the
sun.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
and
the
observations
were
made
on
the
property.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
it
is
essential
to
go
on
the
property
to
get
and
make
a
proper
observation
--
unknown
speaker
i
understood
there
were
some
pictures
in
the
original
record.
unknown
speaker
the
issue
you
want
to
cite
it,
you
would
like
to
have
one
in
the
property--
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
it
account
any
fourth
amendment
claim?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
the
question
i
asked
–
if
there
had
been
notice
here,
do
you
think
that
would
have
satisfied
any
objections
to
the
court
of
appeal
in
light
of
that?
unknown
speaker
and
that
the
evidence
was
just
excluded.
unknown
speaker
and
your
whole
point
is
that
the
record
simply
does
not
support
an
entry
at
a
place
where
consent
would
be
required.
unknown
speaker
no,
maybe
i
misunderstand
you
mr.
kitch,
you
say
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
except
the
testimony
of
some
witness
or
perhaps
of
the
inspector,
that
he
was
on
the
premises.
unknown
speaker
ultimately,
looking
at
the
pictures
where
the
pictures
were
taken
from
--
unknown
speaker
well
what's
the
concern
of
the
united
states
that
this
is
affirmed?
unknown
speaker
it
was
also
a
due
process
problem
here
which
is
just
kind
of
combined
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
with
the
fourth
amendment
problem.
unknown
speaker
this
observation
was
made
in
a
period,
--
it
was
june
4th
1969
if
that's
the
date
and
under
your
statute
an
emission
of
more
than
the
designated
opacity
for
as
long
as
three
minutes
in
any
hour
is
a
violation.
then
this
whole
charge
was
based
upon
that
particular
day
and
people
in
the
western
alfalfa
corporation
had
no
idea
that
any
--
unknown
speaker
tests
then
being
made
and
then
no
opportunity
to
have
their
own
people
that
--
unknown
speaker
but
the
generally
--
unknown
speaker
generally
these
are
ordinary
--
this
is
the
matter
of
expert
testimony
is
it
not?
this
is
not
an
eye
witness
who
said,
“i
saw
that
man
hit
the
other
man
over
the
head”
or
police
gone
or
whatever.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
where
is
the
radar
here,
it's
just
a
man
and
his
naked
eye.
unknown
speaker
what
has
been
required
i
missed
it?
unknown
speaker
two
kind
of
standards
are
opacity
and
density
or
what's
the
other
one
called?
unknown
speaker
you
see
black
smoke
and
you
say
(inaudible)
smokes
black
--
unknown
speaker
over
a
quite
a
long
period
--
unknown
speaker
that's
called
what
not
density?
unknown
speaker
particulates.
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
opinions
indicates
that
the
western
has
its
own
ringelmann
testimony.
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
says,
western
counted
this
evidence
with
the
ringelmann
readings
taken
by
a
consulting
engineers
hired
by
western
which
showed
no
violation
and
they
also
offered
result
for
the
sophisticated
test
conducted
at
their
plant
by
an
independent
engineering
firm,
some
months
after
they
were
issued
the
cease
and
desist
order.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
first
doesn't
seem
to
be
an
offer,
it
seems
to
be
the
introduction
of
evidence.
unknown
speaker
of
course
they
couldn’t
meet
the
charge,
vis-a-vis,
june
6th
because
they
had
no
idea,
any
test
was
being
made
on
that
day
and
that's
what
the
court
of
appeal
says,
as
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
the
same
objections
though,
would
you,
if
freed
from
fourth
amendment
overtone
--
some
court
would
decide
there
was
a
denial
of
due
process.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
the
federal
statue
seems
to
require
a
presentations
of
credentials.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
same
kind
of
argument
that
is
made
in
every
constitutional
case.
the
argument
of
necessity,
practicality.
and
that
you
can’t
catch
wrong
doors
without
busting
into
their
houses
in
the
middle
of
the
night
without
warrants
and
so
on.
unknown
speaker
the
proceedings
before
the
court,
some
of
the
statements
that
you
made
that
this
has
been
an
ongoing
controversy
between
the
state
authority
and
the
respondent.
unknown
speaker
your
comment
at
the
hearing
that
apparently
respondent
did
not
satisfy
the
ringelmann
requirements,
as
result
of
test
--
i
am
referring
to
page
73?
unknown
speaker
there
are
written
violations
and
visual
violations.
unknown
speaker
and
western
alfalfa
let
that
at
extent
–
from
these
particular
test
and
judging
from
the
testimony
i
heard,
at
the
first
hearing
unless
there
is
some
change
in
the
operation,
i
will
expect
it
to
come
out
and
say
we
are
--
i
mean
this
is
not
surprise.
unknown
speaker
of
all
the
bootleg
establishment,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
do
you
offer
at
any
time
any
evidence
that
the
company
was
complying
with
these
tests
–
do
they
their
own
tests.
unknown
speaker
back
again
to
that
colloquy
on
page
77
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
you
say
that
you
could
not
possibly
–
would
you
say
defense
--
at
that
what
you
had
offered,
whether
it
was
august
or
whatever
date
it
was
that
was
taken,
that
there
was
testimony,
the
conditions
on
the
august
day
were
same
as
june
4
and
therefore
you
had
done
the
best
you
could
with
your
particular
evidence,
it
was
established
that
since
as
of
august,
you
were
in
compliance
and
the
conditions
were
the
same
as
on
june
4.
therefore
the
board
should
take
as
your
defense
left
on
june
4th
you
were
in
compliance,
wasn't
that
it?
unknown
speaker
instantly
getting
back,
another
page
73,
your
discussion
was
a
sort
of
burden
of
proof
thing.
i
am
looking
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
where
you
say
that
you
would
expect
the
staff
to
come
out
and
say
well,
the
ringelmann
violations
and
the
only
the
way
you
will
be
able
effectively
to
defense
against
that
by
making
expensive
particular
tests
--
unknown
speaker
and
make
it
when
as
of
the
same
day
that
the
visual
readings
were
taken.
unknown
speaker
unless
you
knew
about
it.
unknown
speaker
as
a
matter
of
colorado
law,
what's
the
aftermath,
denial
of
the
variance
board,
the
board
denied
the
variance.
unknown
speaker
are
you
denying
this,
you
must
know
your
plans
certainly
or
that
the
plumes
were
visible?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
an
order
issued
denying
a
variance.
unknown
speaker
ignoring
this
premise
point,
the
district
court
in
colorado
overturned
the
administrative
decision,
said
it
wasn’t
even
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
unknown
speaker
the
court
decided
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cawelti,
if
you
feel
so
strongly
that
it
was
a
search,
why
wasn't
this
raised
in
the
colorado
court?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
are
you
familiar
with
the
case
of
united
states
against
lee
decided
about
the
same
advantage
as
hester
a
little
later
probation
era,
where
the
coast
guard
cutter
shined
its
light
on
the
rum
runner?
i
think
that
was
not
a
violation
of
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
i
mean
the
search
light
on
the
coast
guard
cutter,
they
grain
alcohol
aboard
the
rum
runner.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cowelti,
may
i
ask
with
this
hypothetical
question
to
you?
suppose
that
the
government
had
reason,
let's
say
the
federal
government
had
reason
to
believe
that
some
criminal
activity
was
going
on
in
your
plant’s
building
in
addition
to
its
legitimate
operation.
we
have
talking
about
stales,
let's
assume
they
had
some
reason
to
believe
a
stale
was
being
operated
there.
counterfeit
operation
and
that
an
fbi
agent
had
come
on
to
premises
to
same
extent
as
the
colorado
inspector
did
here
and
taking
photographs
would
your
position
be
the
same?
unknown
speaker
no,
all
that
was
done
was
the
government
wanted
photographs
of
the
building.
instead
of
taking
them
with
a
long
lens
camera
say
from
the
highway
government
officer
stepped
on
the
parking
lot
and
took
pictures
of
the
building
that
was
a
suspect
for
the
possible
--
criminal
operation,
would
the
government
have
committed
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
it
would
have
engaged
in
the
trespass
but
would
the
fourth
amendment
have
been
violated?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do
about
the
colonnade
and
biswell?
unknown
speaker
would
that
have
happened
if
the
door
hadn't
been
locked?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
next
case?
unknown
speaker
as
your
petition
for
certiorari
was
granted.
unknown
speaker
alright,
you
are
quite
right.
unknown
speaker
