no,
i
know

but
did
he
approach
the

from

justice
william

how
far
was
the

--
how
far
was
the
point
at
which
he
took
the
opacity
readings
from
the

itself,
from
the
building,
from
the

on

to

court

held
the
--
an
inspection
by
a
state
health
inspector
to
be
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
because
the
inspection
was
made
without

the

inspector
entered
the
outdoor
premises
of
respondent
in
daylight
without
his
knowledge
or
consent
to
make
an
opacity
test
of
smoke,
the
ringelmann
test
commonly
used
to
measure
the
density
of
the
smoke
that
was
being
emitted
from
the
respondent's
chimneys,
a
sight
that
could
be
observed
from
many
different
points
on
the
premises
and
off
the
premises.
we
hold
that
the
--
no
warrant
under
the
fourth
amendment
was
needed
under
those
circumstances.
thus
as
court
has
held
previously
in
the
cases
cited
that
the
search
does
not
require
a
warrant,
but
extends
only
to
sights
that
are
seen
in
the
open
fields
and
this
was
comparable
to
that
situation.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
of
colorado
on
that
point
and
remand
to
it
for
consideration
of
such
other
questions
as
maybe
left
open.
