not
the

mr.
cawelti,
your
reference
to
your
colloquy
of
mr
heaton
at
page
77,
i
take
it
the
board
is
probably
a
lay
board
that
does
not
consist
entirely
of
attorneys,
and
in
my
own
expense
with
those
kind
of
boards
is
frequently
a
member
of
the
board
may
not
properly
conceive
exactly
what
the
legal
issue
is
but
generally
before
they
make
their
decision
they
are
advised
by
their
counsel.
i
wonder
if
it's
entirely
fair
to
a
tribute
to
mr.
heaton,
what
is
the
ultimate
position
of
the
board
as
to
the
issue
of
when
the
violation
was
occurred?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
appendix
for
what
might
be
the
judgment
or
order
of
the
board?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cawelti,
in
the
findings
of
fact
of
variance
board
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
appendix
e2,
one
of
the
findings
of
fact
is
at
page
number
6
that
petitioner
performed
a
test
pursuant
to
section
such
and
such
of
the
colorado
statute.
but
the
board
finds
that
petitioner
did
not
comply
with
the
statute
in
performing
set
tests,
etcetera,
etcetera.
i
don't
get
any
implication
from
that
finding
or
any
of
the
others
that
the
fact,
the
test
may
have
related
to
a
different
date
would
have
meant
that
the
board
would
have
excluded
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
not
bound
by
what
justice
white
tells
you
is
your
strongest
point.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
a
question
about
those
cases
if
i
may
mr.
cowelti.
in
the
california
banker's
case,
this
court
held
that
that
at
the
beginning
of
the
month,
we
referred
to
the
united
states
versus
morton
salt,
which
was
decided
in
the
late
forties
to
the
effect
that
corporations
don't
have
as
extensive
fourth
amendment
rights
as
individuals.
now
as
i
recall
camara
and
see
were
both
cases
of
individual
householders,
weren't
they
at
least
non-corporate
businesses?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
right
of
privacy
depends
at
all
on
who
else
besides
government
inspectors
you
make
welcome,
i
mean
if
you
make
buyers
and
sellers
and
visitors
welcome
to
the
premises,
do
you
think
you
still
have
a
right
of
privacy
as
against
government
inspectors?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
it
is
generally
very
soon
after

it
is
not
ten

two
weeks
later.
