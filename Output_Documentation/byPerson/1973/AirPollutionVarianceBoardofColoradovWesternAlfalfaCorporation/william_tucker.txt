mr.
william
tucker
yes,
mr.
justice
douglas,
and
may
it
please
it
the
court.
i
am
william
tucker,
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
colorado
representing
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
this
case
arises
out
of
a
situation
involving
a
violation
of
the
air
pollution
control
law
in
the
state
of
colorado.
the
western
alfalfa
plant
had
been
under
investigation
and
surveillance
by
the
state
authorities
for
approximately
two
years
prior
to
june
4,
1969,
at
which
time
an
investigator
for
the
state
made
a
trip
into
the
area
where
the
plants
are
located
and
they
made
emissions
and
opacity
readings.
the
opacity
readings
exceeded
the
limits
which
were
allowed
by
the
state
at
that
time,
which
were
40
%
opacity
or
a
number
2
ringelmann,
by
approximate
40
and
45
%
of
the
ringlemann,
and
opacity
readings
which
were
taken
by
the
inspector
were
double
in
some
instances
what
were
allowed
by
the
state.
the
inspector
made
these
opacity
readings
by
driving
up
to
the
plant
from
a
county
or
public
road,
driving
on
to
the
parking
lot
of
a
particular
plant,
taking
the
opacity
readings,
recording
them,
and
taking
photographs,
and
got
into
his
car,
and
returned
or
went
on
his
route
of
investigation.
mr.
william
tucker
he
was
in
the
parking
lot
of
the
western
alfalfa
plant.
mr.
william
tucker
yes,
he
was.
mr.
william
tucker
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
tucker
he
did
not
enter
the
plant
itself.
mr.
william
tucker
no
he
simply
drove
up
to
the
plant
on
the
county
road
and
the
parking
lot
abuts
to
the
county
road,
drove
off
on
to
the
parking
lot,
got
out
of
the
car,
took
the
opacity
readings,
recorded
them
in
writing,
and
made
his
report
at
the
time,
got
back
back
in
the
car,
drove
on
the
county
road,
and
went
to
the
other
plant.
mr.
william
tucker
approximately
400
to
500
feet
as
i
recall,
from
the
nearest
building
in
the
plant
itself.
mr.
william
tucker
no,
there
was
not.
mr.
william
tucker
no,
there
were
not.
as
the
photographs
which
are
a
part
of
the
record
on
par
with
the
court
but
are
not
a
part
of
the
appendix,
indicate
and
show
there
are
no
signs,
there
are
no
fences
around
the
plant
itself
and
there
are
no
signs
that
are
saying
“no
trespassing”.
in
fact
western
alfalfa
sells
its
product
which
is
a
cattle
feed
product
from
the
plants.
the
inspector
then
filled
his
report
with
the
health
department,
and
on
june
16,
1969,
a
cease
and
desist
order
was
issued
to
western
alfalfa.
the
cease
and
desist
order
was
then
appealed,
so
to
speak
to
the
air
pollution
variance
board,
and
western
sought
a
hearing
before
the
air
pollution
variance
board
for
determination
of
whether
it
was
or
was
not
in
violation
of
the
law.
mr.
william
tucker
june
4,
1969
date.
mr.
william
tucker
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
tucker
certainly,
the
hearing
before
the
variance
board
was
held
in
october
and
november
of
1969
and
the
board
reached
the
decision
that
the
western's
operations
were
in
fact
in
violation
of
the
law.
mr.
william
tucker
yes,
when
it
received
the
cease
and
desist
order
dated
june
16,
1969.
mr.
william
tucker
that
is
correct.
the
law
provides
that
a
bond
they
receive
of
a
cease
and
desist
order,
the
party
may
request
a
hearing
before
the
variance
board
for
determination
of
whether
its
operations
are
in
violation
of
the
law
and
whether
it
desires
a
variance
from
the
law.
mr.
william
tucker
no,
mr.
justice
brennan,
when
the
cease
and
desist
order
is
issued,
the
party
has
10
days
within
which
to
request
a
hearing
on
it
and
that
order
is
stayed
or
suspended
until
the
variance
board
has
reached
the
decision.
the
decision
of
the
variance
board
was
appealed
to
the
district
court
in
weld
county,
after
a
hearing
before
the
district
court
and
a
limited
amount
of
testimony,
the
district
court
affirmed
or
reversed
the
decisions
of
the
variance
board
and
held
in
effect
that
the
western
alfalfa
corporation
was
denied
due
process
of
law
because
the
observations
and
questions
were
made
in
secret,
and
without
its
knowledge,
and
the
district
court's
decision
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
colorado,
and
the
colorado
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
reversed
the
decision
of
the
variance
board
and
held
that
western
was
denied
due
process
of
law
because
the
readings
and
question
--
the
opacity
readings
were
taken
without
its
knowledge
and
that
it
had
no
notice
of
the
readings
and
in
addition,
that
western's
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
were
violated
because
they
did
not
consent
to
the
inspector
being
on
the
premises
or
there
was
no
want
for
his
presence
there,
and
the
opacity
readings
which
he
subsequently
took.
we
would.
mr.
william
tucker
the
ambient
air
quality
standards
are
what
the
health
department
determines,
is
the
levels
of
pollution
which
human
beings
and
plant
and
animal
life
can
stand
without
any
bad
effects
to
them.
mr.
william
tucker
it
includes
the
entire
state.
mr.
william
tucker
yes,
if
the
emission
standards
which
were
40
percent
opacity,
are
exceeded
anywhere
in
the
state,
it
is
a
violation
of
the
law.
mr.
william
tucker
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
tucker
well,
he
was
at
the
required
distance
from
the
emissions
that
is
accepted
as
the
standard
distance
to
be
from
the
emission
to
take
an
accurate
reading.
mr.
william
tucker
it
is
set
out
in
the
textbooks
on
taking
ringelmann
readings,
the
distance
and
where
the
sun
should
and
the
wind,
and
etcetera,
to
obtain
an
accurate
opacity
of
ringelmann
reading,
and
here
is
--.
mr.
william
tucker
well,
the.
mr.
william
tucker
the
ambient
air
itself
had
been
tested
and
is
continually
monitored
by
the
state
in
various
locations
around
the
state
and
the
emission
standards
are
the
standards
that
the
state
says,
you
cannot
violate
or
you
will
cause
the
ambient
air
or
(inaudible)
to
be
degraded
to
the
extent
that
will
not
be
helpful
for
the
citizens
and
animal
life
in
the
state
and
the
plant
life.
mr.
william
tucker
yes
it
is
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
william
tucker
in
the
state
statue,
that
is
correct.
the
attorney
general’s
office
then
petitioned
the
colorado
supreme
court
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
which
was
denied
by
that
court.
we
then
petitioned
at
the
us
supreme
court
and
this
court
granted
the
certiorari
on
january
the
21st.
it
is
our
position
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
involved
in
this
case
at
all.
the
observations
which
were
made
were
not
unreasonable.
there
was
no
invasion
of
privacy
of
the
western
alfalfa
plant.
its
personnel
were
not
disturbed,
its
operations
were
not
curtailed,
no
offices
were
searched
and
there
was
no
disruption
of
these
activities.
mr.
william
tucker
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
powell,
they
did
not
even
know
that
the
inspector
was
on
the
premises
and
the
fourth
amendment
only.
mr.
william
tucker
yes
that
is
correct
and
in
the
electronic
surveillance
case,
where
the
agents
put
their
recording
devices
in
telephone
booth,
this
court
held
that
that
was
–
fell
within
the
purview
of
the
fourth
amendment,
but
i
think
the
difference
there
is
that
in
the
telephone
booth
case,
this
court
said,
that
when
the
individual
close
the
door,
he
expected
his
conversation
to
be
private.
western
could
have
no
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy
to
emissions
which
it
was
putting
into
the
atmosphere
for
anyone
who
desired
to
see,
to
simply
look
and
see.
it
was
a
different
situation
from
the
telephone
case,
because
there
the
party
did
expect
his
conversation
to
be
private
and
here
western
could
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
william
tucker
he
was
on
the
western's
property
without
their
consent
or
knowledge.
mr.
william
tucker
that
is
what
they
are
maintaining,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
tucker
well
we
maintain
--
mr.
william
tucker
well
our
inspectors
had
been
going
on
a
premise
--
on
the
property
for
a
period
of
approximate
two
years,
and
in
an
effort
to
voluntarily
bring
western
alfalfa’s
operations
into
compliance
and
during
these
two
year,
approximate
two
year
period
of
time
--
mr.
william
tucker
on
implied
consent,
yes
we
are.
mr.
william
tucker
well
i
think
that
the
number
one,
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
because
there
can
be
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
if,
it
should
apply
then
we
are
arguing
that
there
was
no
implied
consent.
mr.
william
tucker
no
there
would
be
i
think
a
different
situation,
if
they
had
actually
entered
the
building.
mr.
william
tucker
well
i
think
that?
mr.
william
tucker
pardon.
mr.
william
tucker
it
derives
from
a
period
of
approximate
two
years
activity,
wherein
western
had
an
opportunity
during
that
period
of
time
at
anytime
to
object
to
the
presence
of
the
inspectors
from
the
state
and
which
it
did
not.
mr.
william
tucker
they
made
periodic
visits
to
all
of
other
plants
owned
by
western
alfalfa
and
made
opacity
and
ringelmann
readings
and
would
go
into
the
plant
actually
and
confer
with
the
officials
in
regard
to
what
equipment
had
been
installed,
what
effect
that
it
was
having
and
they
were
making
some
progress
toward
bringing
operation
under
compliance.
mr.
william
tucker
oh
no,
they
were
--
well
now
the
readings
have
to
be
taken
outside
of
the
plant
premises
because
the
emissions
are
going
up
into
the
atmosphere
from
the
plant,
from
the
outside
of
plant
and
so
you
could
not
take
opacity
readings
while
you
are
inside
the
plant
and
the
opacity
--
the
emissions
are
what
violates
the
law
and
so
those
readings
have
to
be
taken
outside
of
the
physical
plant
premises.
mr.
william
tucker
we
argued.
well,
actually
before
the
colorado
court
of
appeals,
the
fourth
amendment
was
not
argued
by
--
mr.
william
tucker
no
because
the
fourth
amendment
was
actually
not
a
question
in
the
case
at
that
time.
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
had
--
of
course
court
of
appeals
decision
hadn’t
come
down,
but
they
did
not
have
the
fourth
amendment
question
in
it.
the
fourth
amendment
question
just
came
out
of
blue
from
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
william
tucker
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
tucker
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
tucker
well,
we
didn’t
argue.
mr.
william
tucker
yes
we
did.
mr.
william
tucker
the
implied
consent?
mr.
william
tucker
no
we
did
not.
mr.
william
tucker
well,
i
think
that
is
absurdity
of
the
respondent’s
position
because
the
ringelmann
readings
could
have
been
taken
from
the
county
road.
he
merely
pulled
onto
the
parking
lot
to
get
his
car
off
the
road,
not
in
the
parking
lot
and
the
opacity
readings
can
be
taken
from
off
the
property
owned
by
the
party
at
question.
mr.
william
tucker
yes,
it
is
a
kansas
corporation.
next,
i
would
like
to
get
into
the
due
process
question
and
western
objects
here
because
it
asserts
that
because
it
did
not
receive
notice
that
the
readings
were
being
taken
that
it
could
not
effectively
rebut
the
state's
case.
and
this
reasoning
is
not
logical
on
two
basic
premises.
number
one;
western
had
an
opportunity
at
the
hearing
before
the
board
to
put
on
whatever
evidence
it
desired.
what
it
did
put
before
the
board
was
a
testimony
from
a
vice
president
that
he
had
hired
mr.
richard
roning
(ph)
some
months
before
this
june
4,
1969
incident
to
take
readings
and
that
it
was
his
opinion
that
their
emissions
did
not
exceed
the
40
%
opacity
limited
by
the
state.
there
was
no
evidence
that
mr.
roning(ph)
was
qualified
to
take
opacity
readings.
they
also
hired
a
local
engineering
firm
to
do
a
study
of
their
emissions,
after
the
cease
and
desist
order
was
issued,
but
they
did
not
comply
with
the
other
statue.
the
statue
provides
that
if
you
are
going
to
have
an
emission
particulate
study
that
you
must
notify
the
division
and
the
division
must
be
present
during
the
time
that
the
study
is
made
so
that
it
can
determine
that
the
methods
used
have
some
correlation
to
the
ringelmann
and
opacity
readings.
so
western
put
evidence
before
the
board
which
was
not
competent
evidence.
it
could
have
had
a
qualified
opacity
or
ringelmann
reader
on
its
premises
taking
readings
everyday.
it
is
required
to
have
its
operation
in
compliance
everyday.
in
fact,
the
law
provides
that
if
the
emissions
exceed
the
40
%
opacity
for
three
minutes
during
any
one
hour,
then
it
is
in
violation
of
the
law.
mr.
william
tucker
the
state
conducts
a
school
and
it
is
very
inexpensive
thing.
they
have,
what
they
call
a
smoke
generating
machine
which
has
an
electronic
eye
in
it
and
it
simply
shoots
up
plumes
of
smoke
which
are
measured
by
the
electronic
eye
guy
and
the
reader
watches
the
smoke
until
he
becomes
trained
to
read
the
smoke
within
5
%
error
and
he
must
take
fifty
readings
that
do
not
exceed
5
%
on
either
side
and
if
he
has
any
one
reading
out
of
fifty
that
exceeds
20
%,
he
must
receive
more
training
until
he
attains
that
--
mr.
william
tucker
it
takes
about
a
week.
mr.
william
tucker
yes.
mr.
william
tucker
no.
mr.
william
tucker
well
they
do
have
a
recommended
distance
from
the
opacity
or
from
the
emissions
within
which
an
inspector
should
be
to
obtain
the
best
accuracy.
now,
i
would
point
out
that
in
this
case
of
course,
these
emissions
as
picture
show
which
are
on
file
with
the
court,
could
be
observed
from
some
distance
and
in
fact
some
of
the
pictures
were
taken
some
distance
from
the
plant.
so,
the
inspector
observed
violation
before
he
ever
entered
on
to
the
plant
premises,
and
after
he
had
observed
violations
that
he
drove
up
to
the
plant,
he
pulled
off
on
the
parking
lot
and
took
the
readings
which
were
receptive.
mr.
william
tucker
well,
of
course,
it's
a
speculation
and
it
could
have.
mr.
william
tucker
well,
the
court
of
appeals,
mr.
justice
white
seemed
to
be
disturbed
by
the
lack
of
notice
and
the
fact
that
the
readings
were
taken
without
their
consent
or
without
a
warrant.
all
three
seems
to
disturb
the
court
of
appeals
and
so
i
can’t
pick
one
of
them
out
and
say
if
we
removed
that,
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
probably
affirmed
air
pollution
variance
board.
mr.
william
tucker
no,
the
agency
has
not.
mr.
william
tucker
there's
no
change
in
the
law.
that
is
correct
but
as
a
matter
of
course,
people
don't
object
and
i
don't
know
of
any
instance
where
they
have
obtained
a
warrant.
they
simply
follow
the
same
procedure.
mr.
william
tucker
yes,
the
air
pollution
law
does.
mr.
william
tucker
pardon.
mr.
william
tucker
no,
they
do
not.
mr.
william
tucker
well
it
would
be
registered
at
the
time
of
the
hearing.
mr.
william
tucker
that
is
correct.
i
would
like
to
reserve
--
mr.
william
tucker
yes.
mr.
william
tucker
i
think
the
relevancy
is
to
the
water
pollution
and
the
other
laws
and
of
course,
as
you
know,
there
are
34
states,
and
the
federal
government
in
this
case
is
amicus.
many
of
them
have
laws
that
are
similar
to
colorado’s
law
as
it
existed
at
time
of
this
particular
incident.
mr.
william
tucker
but
if
this
court
should
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals,
it
would
have
a
drastic
effect
upon
the
water
pollution
enforcement
and
other
health
laws
in
state
which
many
of
them
do
not
require
a
warrant
or
consent,
but
they
simply
provide
as
the
air
pollution
law
did
for
entry
and
inspection.
mr.
william
tucker
well,
i
think
that
the
validity
of
the
reading
taken
on
june
4
of
1969
was
taken
under
that
particular
statute
and
the
question
is
whether
that
reading
violated
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
the
western
alfaalfa
--
mr.
william
tucker
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
tucker
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
tucker
yes,
mr.
justice
douglas,
and
may
it
please
it
the
court.
i
am
william
tucker,
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
colorado
representing
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
this
case
arises
out
of
a
situation
involving
a
violation
of
the
air
pollution
control
law
in
the
state
of
colorado.
the
western
alfalfa
plant
had
been
under
investigation
and
surveillance
by
the
state
authorities
for
approximately
two
years
prior
to
june
4,
1969,
at
which
time
an
investigator
for
the
state
made
a
trip
into
the
area
where
the
plants
are
located
and
they
made
emissions
and
opacity
readings.
the
opacity
readings
exceeded
the
limits
which
were
allowed
by
the
state
at
that
time,
which
were
40
%
opacity
or
a
number
2
ringelmann,
by
approximate
40
and
45
%
of
the
ringlemann,
and
opacity
readings
which
were
taken
by
the
inspector
were
double
in
some
instances
what
were
allowed
by
the
state.
the
inspector
made
these
opacity
readings
by
driving
up
to
the
plant
from
a
county
or
public
road,
driving
on
to
the
parking
lot
of
a
particular
plant,
taking
the
opacity
readings,
recording
them,
and
taking
photographs,
and
got
into
his
car,
and
returned
or
went
on
his
route
of
investigation.
mr.
william
tucker
he
was
in
the
parking
lot
of
the
western
alfalfa
plant.
mr.
william
tucker
yes,
he
was.
mr.
william
tucker
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
tucker
he
did
not
enter
the
plant
itself.
mr.
william
tucker
no
he
simply
drove
up
to
the
plant
on
the
county
road
and
the
parking
lot
abuts
to
the
county
road,
drove
off
on
to
the
parking
lot,
got
out
of
the
car,
took
the
opacity
readings,
recorded
them
in
writing,
and
made
his
report
at
the
time,
got
back
back
in
the
car,
drove
on
the
county
road,
and
went
to
the
other
plant.
mr.
william
tucker
approximately
400
to
500
feet
as
i
recall,
from
the
nearest
building
in
the
plant
itself.
mr.
william
tucker
no,
there
was
not.
mr.
william
tucker
no,
there
were
not.
as
the
photographs
which
are
a
part
of
the
record
on
par
with
the
court
but
are
not
a
part
of
the
appendix,
indicate
and
show
there
are
no
signs,
there
are
no
fences
around
the
plant
itself
and
there
are
no
signs
that
are
saying
“no
trespassing”.
in
fact
western
alfalfa
sells
its
product
which
is
a
cattle
feed
product
from
the
plants.
the
inspector
then
filled
his
report
with
the
health
department,
and
on
june
16,
1969,
a
cease
and
desist
order
was
issued
to
western
alfalfa.
the
cease
and
desist
order
was
then
appealed,
so
to
speak
to
the
air
pollution
variance
board,
and
western
sought
a
hearing
before
the
air
pollution
variance
board
for
determination
of
whether
it
was
or
was
not
in
violation
of
the
law.
mr.
william
tucker
june
4,
1969
date.
mr.
william
tucker
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
tucker
certainly,
the
hearing
before
the
variance
board
was
held
in
october
and
november
of
1969
and
the
board
reached
the
decision
that
the
western's
operations
were
in
fact
in
violation
of
the
law.
mr.
william
tucker
yes,
when
it
received
the
cease
and
desist
order
dated
june
16,
1969.
mr.
william
tucker
that
is
correct.
the
law
provides
that
a
bond
they
receive
of
a
cease
and
desist
order,
the
party
may
request
a
hearing
before
the
variance
board
for
determination
of
whether
its
operations
are
in
violation
of
the
law
and
whether
it
desires
a
variance
from
the
law.
mr.
william
tucker
no,
mr.
justice
brennan,
when
the
cease
and
desist
order
is
issued,
the
party
has
10
days
within
which
to
request
a
hearing
on
it
and
that
order
is
stayed
or
suspended
until
the
variance
board
has
reached
the
decision.
the
decision
of
the
variance
board
was
appealed
to
the
district
court
in
weld
county,
after
a
hearing
before
the
district
court
and
a
limited
amount
of
testimony,
the
district
court
affirmed
or
reversed
the
decisions
of
the
variance
board
and
held
in
effect
that
the
western
alfalfa
corporation
was
denied
due
process
of
law
because
the
observations
and
questions
were
made
in
secret,
and
without
its
knowledge,
and
the
district
court's
decision
was
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
colorado,
and
the
colorado
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
decision
of
the
district
court
and
reversed
the
decision
of
the
variance
board
and
held
that
western
was
denied
due
process
of
law
because
the
readings
and
question
--
the
opacity
readings
were
taken
without
its
knowledge
and
that
it
had
no
notice
of
the
readings
and
in
addition,
that
western's
rights
under
the
fourth
amendment
were
violated
because
they
did
not
consent
to
the
inspector
being
on
the
premises
or
there
was
no
want
for
his
presence
there,
and
the
opacity
readings
which
he
subsequently
took.
we
would.
mr.
william
tucker
the
ambient
air
quality
standards
are
what
the
health
department
determines,
is
the
levels
of
pollution
which
human
beings
and
plant
and
animal
life
can
stand
without
any
bad
effects
to
them.
mr.
william
tucker
it
includes
the
entire
state.
mr.
william
tucker
yes,
if
the
emission
standards
which
were
40
percent
opacity,
are
exceeded
anywhere
in
the
state,
it
is
a
violation
of
the
law.
mr.
william
tucker
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
tucker
well,
he
was
at
the
required
distance
from
the
emissions
that
is
accepted
as
the
standard
distance
to
be
from
the
emission
to
take
an
accurate
reading.
mr.
william
tucker
it
is
set
out
in
the
textbooks
on
taking
ringelmann
readings,
the
distance
and
where
the
sun
should
and
the
wind,
and
etcetera,
to
obtain
an
accurate
opacity
of
ringelmann
reading,
and
here
is
--.
mr.
william
tucker
well,
the.
mr.
william
tucker
the
ambient
air
itself
had
been
tested
and
is
continually
monitored
by
the
state
in
various
locations
around
the
state
and
the
emission
standards
are
the
standards
that
the
state
says,
you
cannot
violate
or
you
will
cause
the
ambient
air
or
(inaudible)
to
be
degraded
to
the
extent
that
will
not
be
helpful
for
the
citizens
and
animal
life
in
the
state
and
the
plant
life.
mr.
william
tucker
yes
it
is
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
william
tucker
in
the
state
statue,
that
is
correct.
the
attorney
general’s
office
then
petitioned
the
colorado
supreme
court
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
which
was
denied
by
that
court.
we
then
petitioned
at
the
us
supreme
court
and
this
court
granted
the
certiorari
on
january
the
21st.
it
is
our
position
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
involved
in
this
case
at
all.
the
observations
which
were
made
were
not
unreasonable.
there
was
no
invasion
of
privacy
of
the
western
alfalfa
plant.
its
personnel
were
not
disturbed,
its
operations
were
not
curtailed,
no
offices
were
searched
and
there
was
no
disruption
of
these
activities.
mr.
william
tucker
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
powell,
they
did
not
even
know
that
the
inspector
was
on
the
premises
and
the
fourth
amendment
only.
mr.
william
tucker
yes
that
is
correct
and
in
the
electronic
surveillance
case,
where
the
agents
put
their
recording
devices
in
telephone
booth,
this
court
held
that
that
was
–
fell
within
the
purview
of
the
fourth
amendment,
but
i
think
the
difference
there
is
that
in
the
telephone
booth
case,
this
court
said,
that
when
the
individual
close
the
door,
he
expected
his
conversation
to
be
private.
western
could
have
no
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy
to
emissions
which
it
was
putting
into
the
atmosphere
for
anyone
who
desired
to
see,
to
simply
look
and
see.
it
was
a
different
situation
from
the
telephone
case,
because
there
the
party
did
expect
his
conversation
to
be
private
and
here
western
could
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
william
tucker
he
was
on
the
western's
property
without
their
consent
or
knowledge.
mr.
william
tucker
that
is
what
they
are
maintaining,
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
tucker
well
we
maintain
--
mr.
william
tucker
well
our
inspectors
had
been
going
on
a
premise
--
on
the
property
for
a
period
of
approximate
two
years,
and
in
an
effort
to
voluntarily
bring
western
alfalfa’s
operations
into
compliance
and
during
these
two
year,
approximate
two
year
period
of
time
--
mr.
william
tucker
on
implied
consent,
yes
we
are.
mr.
william
tucker
well
i
think
that
the
number
one,
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
because
there
can
be
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy.
if,
it
should
apply
then
we
are
arguing
that
there
was
no
implied
consent.
mr.
william
tucker
no
there
would
be
i
think
a
different
situation,
if
they
had
actually
entered
the
building.
mr.
william
tucker
well
i
think
that?
mr.
william
tucker
pardon.
mr.
william
tucker
it
derives
from
a
period
of
approximate
two
years
activity,
wherein
western
had
an
opportunity
during
that
period
of
time
at
anytime
to
object
to
the
presence
of
the
inspectors
from
the
state
and
which
it
did
not.
mr.
william
tucker
they
made
periodic
visits
to
all
of
other
plants
owned
by
western
alfalfa
and
made
opacity
and
ringelmann
readings
and
would
go
into
the
plant
actually
and
confer
with
the
officials
in
regard
to
what
equipment
had
been
installed,
what
effect
that
it
was
having
and
they
were
making
some
progress
toward
bringing
operation
under
compliance.
mr.
william
tucker
oh
no,
they
were
--
well
now
the
readings
have
to
be
taken
outside
of
the
plant
premises
because
the
emissions
are
going
up
into
the
atmosphere
from
the
plant,
from
the
outside
of
plant
and
so
you
could
not
take
opacity
readings
while
you
are
inside
the
plant
and
the
opacity
--
the
emissions
are
what
violates
the
law
and
so
those
readings
have
to
be
taken
outside
of
the
physical
plant
premises.
mr.
william
tucker
we
argued.
well,
actually
before
the
colorado
court
of
appeals,
the
fourth
amendment
was
not
argued
by
--
mr.
william
tucker
no
because
the
fourth
amendment
was
actually
not
a
question
in
the
case
at
that
time.
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
had
--
of
course
court
of
appeals
decision
hadn’t
come
down,
but
they
did
not
have
the
fourth
amendment
question
in
it.
the
fourth
amendment
question
just
came
out
of
blue
from
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
william
tucker
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
tucker
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
tucker
well,
we
didn’t
argue.
mr.
william
tucker
yes
we
did.
mr.
william
tucker
the
implied
consent?
mr.
william
tucker
no
we
did
not.
mr.
william
tucker
well,
i
think
that
is
absurdity
of
the
respondent’s
position
because
the
ringelmann
readings
could
have
been
taken
from
the
county
road.
he
merely
pulled
onto
the
parking
lot
to
get
his
car
off
the
road,
not
in
the
parking
lot
and
the
opacity
readings
can
be
taken
from
off
the
property
owned
by
the
party
at
question.
mr.
william
tucker
yes,
it
is
a
kansas
corporation.
next,
i
would
like
to
get
into
the
due
process
question
and
western
objects
here
because
it
asserts
that
because
it
did
not
receive
notice
that
the
readings
were
being
taken
that
it
could
not
effectively
rebut
the
state's
case.
and
this
reasoning
is
not
logical
on
two
basic
premises.
number
one;
western
had
an
opportunity
at
the
hearing
before
the
board
to
put
on
whatever
evidence
it
desired.
what
it
did
put
before
the
board
was
a
testimony
from
a
vice
president
that
he
had
hired
mr.
richard
roning
(ph)
some
months
before
this
june
4,
1969
incident
to
take
readings
and
that
it
was
his
opinion
that
their
emissions
did
not
exceed
the
40
%
opacity
limited
by
the
state.
there
was
no
evidence
that
mr.
roning(ph)
was
qualified
to
take
opacity
readings.
they
also
hired
a
local
engineering
firm
to
do
a
study
of
their
emissions,
after
the
cease
and
desist
order
was
issued,
but
they
did
not
comply
with
the
other
statue.
the
statue
provides
that
if
you
are
going
to
have
an
emission
particulate
study
that
you
must
notify
the
division
and
the
division
must
be
present
during
the
time
that
the
study
is
made
so
that
it
can
determine
that
the
methods
used
have
some
correlation
to
the
ringelmann
and
opacity
readings.
so
western
put
evidence
before
the
board
which
was
not
competent
evidence.
it
could
have
had
a
qualified
opacity
or
ringelmann
reader
on
its
premises
taking
readings
everyday.
it
is
required
to
have
its
operation
in
compliance
everyday.
in
fact,
the
law
provides
that
if
the
emissions
exceed
the
40
%
opacity
for
three
minutes
during
any
one
hour,
then
it
is
in
violation
of
the
law.
mr.
william
tucker
the
state
conducts
a
school
and
it
is
very
inexpensive
thing.
they
have,
what
they
call
a
smoke
generating
machine
which
has
an
electronic
eye
in
it
and
it
simply
shoots
up
plumes
of
smoke
which
are
measured
by
the
electronic
eye
guy
and
the
reader
watches
the
smoke
until
he
becomes
trained
to
read
the
smoke
within
5
%
error
and
he
must
take
fifty
readings
that
do
not
exceed
5
%
on
either
side
and
if
he
has
any
one
reading
out
of
fifty
that
exceeds
20
%,
he
must
receive
more
training
until
he
attains
that
--
mr.
william
tucker
it
takes
about
a
week.
mr.
william
tucker
yes.
mr.
william
tucker
no.
mr.
william
tucker
well
they
do
have
a
recommended
distance
from
the
opacity
or
from
the
emissions
within
which
an
inspector
should
be
to
obtain
the
best
accuracy.
now,
i
would
point
out
that
in
this
case
of
course,
these
emissions
as
picture
show
which
are
on
file
with
the
court,
could
be
observed
from
some
distance
and
in
fact
some
of
the
pictures
were
taken
some
distance
from
the
plant.
so,
the
inspector
observed
violation
before
he
ever
entered
on
to
the
plant
premises,
and
after
he
had
observed
violations
that
he
drove
up
to
the
plant,
he
pulled
off
on
the
parking
lot
and
took
the
readings
which
were
receptive.
mr.
william
tucker
well,
of
course,
it's
a
speculation
and
it
could
have.
mr.
william
tucker
well,
the
court
of
appeals,
mr.
justice
white
seemed
to
be
disturbed
by
the
lack
of
notice
and
the
fact
that
the
readings
were
taken
without
their
consent
or
without
a
warrant.
all
three
seems
to
disturb
the
court
of
appeals
and
so
i
can’t
pick
one
of
them
out
and
say
if
we
removed
that,
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
probably
affirmed
air
pollution
variance
board.
mr.
william
tucker
no,
the
agency
has
not.
mr.
william
tucker
there's
no
change
in
the
law.
that
is
correct
but
as
a
matter
of
course,
people
don't
object
and
i
don't
know
of
any
instance
where
they
have
obtained
a
warrant.
they
simply
follow
the
same
procedure.
mr.
william
tucker
yes,
the
air
pollution
law
does.
mr.
william
tucker
pardon.
mr.
william
tucker
no,
they
do
not.
mr.
william
tucker
well
it
would
be
registered
at
the
time
of
the
hearing.
mr.
william
tucker
that
is
correct.
i
would
like
to
reserve
--
mr.
william
tucker
yes.
mr.
william
tucker
i
think
the
relevancy
is
to
the
water
pollution
and
the
other
laws
and
of
course,
as
you
know,
there
are
34
states,
and
the
federal
government
in
this
case
is
amicus.
many
of
them
have
laws
that
are
similar
to
colorado’s
law
as
it
existed
at
time
of
this
particular
incident.
mr.
william
tucker
but
if
this
court
should
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals,
it
would
have
a
drastic
effect
upon
the
water
pollution
enforcement
and
other
health
laws
in
state
which
many
of
them
do
not
require
a
warrant
or
consent,
but
they
simply
provide
as
the
air
pollution
law
did
for
entry
and
inspection.
mr.
william
tucker
well,
i
think
that
the
validity
of
the
reading
taken
on
june
4
of
1969
was
taken
under
that
particular
statute
and
the
question
is
whether
that
reading
violated
the
fourth
amendment
rights
of
the
western
alfaalfa
--
mr.
william
tucker
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
tucker
that
is
correct.
