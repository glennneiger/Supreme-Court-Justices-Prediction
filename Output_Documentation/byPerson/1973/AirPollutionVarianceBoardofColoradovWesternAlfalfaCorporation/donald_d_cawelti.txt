mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
donald
d.
cawelti.
i
am
the
attorney
for
the
respondent
and
have
been
through
these
longs
proceedings.
i
have
some
remarks
that
i
would
like
to
proceed
with
in
some
order,
but
i
think
particularly
in
view
of
the
questions
that
have
been
addressed
to
the
court;
i
would
like
very
much
to
point
out
what
this
record
shows
and
what
it
does
not
show.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
no,
it
is
been
ongoing,
i
would
not
characterize
it
as
a
controversy.
justice
white,
this
was
mr.
tucker
that
this
has
been
going
on
for
some
two
years
previous
in
this
implied
consent
discussions
we
had.
certainly
these
personnel
from
the
enforcement
department
of
division
of
health
had
been
on
western's
premises
during,
i
believe
two
seasons
previous
to
this
hearing.
this
was
during
that
period
of
time
which
is
referred
to
in
the
statue
as
the
conference
conciliation
and
persuasion
phase
of
enforcement.
they
were
on
there,
announced
their
presence,
discussed
what
was
going
on,
suggested
improvements,
this
is
all
shown
in
the
record
and
indeed
as
the
inspector
admitted,
substantial
improvements
have
been
made.
they
were
looking
much
better.
in
fact
i
think
they
had
in
view
of
the
remarks
they
have
made
tended
to
western
into
a
sense,
particularly
with
mr.
roning's
report
of
their
own
examiners,
that
they
were
in
compliance
or
very
close
to
compliance.
so
this
had
been
going
on
in
a
very
cooperative
way,
i
think
the
records
shows
for
these
previous
two
years.
these
two
years
before
they
were
on
that,
they
were
not
there
to
gather
evidence
when
they
came
on
the
premises.
they
were
there
in
conference
and
conciliation.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
i
don’t
recall
that
remark
in
the
context,
it
was
made
in
mr.
justice
douglas.
we
did
deny
in
a
number
of
places
throughout
the
record
that
--
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
well,
it
was
clear
that
staff
of
the
enforcement
people
did
feel
that.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
well
the
staff
was
insisting
right
at
this
not
--
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
no,
the
staff
was
saying
right
at
this
hearing,
where
i
made
this
remark
that
there
were
violations
and
i
expect
my
remark
was
made
in
that
context,
i
expect
the
staff
to
continue
with
that
expression.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
here
is
what
we
offered
which
is
pretty
always
–
we
thought
we
could
--
that
they
had
been
out
there
the
year
before
in
1967
and
observed
very
marginal
violations
40%
to
50%
at
these
plants.
the
violation
being
40
%
we
offer
an
evidence,
they
had
written
the
following
summer
of
1968,
that
they
had
noted
marked
improvement
in
the
operation
of
the
plants.
we
offered
the
evidence
of
mr.
roning's
examination
that
following
fall
in
1968,
finding
them
in
compliance
with
visual
standards.
this
was
all
before
the
critical
june
4th
date.
we
offered
the
results
of
particular
examination
made,
august
following
the
june
when
the
state
was
out
there
showing
that
from
a
particular
point
of
view,
they
were
in
compliance
and
i
do
disagree
with
mr.
tucker's
remark
that
this
state
would
entertain
evidence
as
to
what
occurred
after
june
4th.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
page
77
of
the
record
or
i
had
myself
in
exchange
with
mr.
heaton,
one
of
the
board
members
he
stated,
let
me
talk
about
the
moot
law
on
june
4th,
the
specific
law
on
june
4th.
as
the
law
reads
on
that
date
or
on
the
june
16th
could
you
have
been
in
violation,
i
replied,
yes,
our
own
view
is
we
were
not,
in
our
own
testimony,
as
we
were
not.
mr.
heaton
stated
to
me,
no
your
testimony
was
in
fact
that
you
were
in
violation
in
august.
i
do
not
have
a
date
of
that
report,
let
me
just
correct,
it
was
august.
and
so
far
your
testimony
is
that
you
did
not
think
you
are
in
violation
of
the
law
on
that
date.
and
there
is
another
reference
in
there
but
i
could
not
find
it
during
--
since
this
came
up
there
is
in
one
of
the
records
somewhere
that
june
4th
was
their
date.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
when
this
went
to
the
district
court,
about
the
only
thing
that
we
did
have
a
evidentiary
hearing,
the
only
that
hearing
was
concerned
with
was
the
adequacy
and
constitutional
validity
of
the
ringelmann
test.
we
did
not
try
to
rehash
or
i
think
we
were
permitted
to
introduce
further
evidence
that
the
variance
board
did
not
consider.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
not
very
much.
the
only
thing
that
was
in
the
record,
the
department
of
attorney
was
correct.
we
do
not
have
any
–
there
is
no
reference
to
the
parking
lot
in
the
record,
nowhere.
that
expression
isn't
in
the
record.
where
this
comes
from
in
the
briefs
and
arguments,
i
have
no
idea.
the
record
all
it
says
is
the
observation
were
made
by
an
entry
to
the
premises
of
the
western.
there's
nothing
further
than
that.
unfortunately
perhaps,
but
that
is
all
it
says.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
no
it's
not
fair
tribute
to
mr
heaton
where
other
board
members
may
have
felt
but
not
said.
he
happened
to
be
a
more
outspoken
member
of
the
board
as
the
record
shows.
the
decision
of
the
board
itself
on
the
violation
on
the
dating
question,
i
think
that
will
be
shown
in
the
appendix.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
yes,
i
think
that
was
attached
to
the
original
petition
for
cert.
it
is
not
in
the
appendix
but
attached
to
the
original
petition
and
that
refers
to
the
date
--
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
that
is
what
we
tried,
board
apparently
did
not
accept
it.
it
took
the
visual
observations
made
on
june
4th
in
preference
to
the
--
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
yes,
there
was
a
confused
period
of
time
here
involved
that
i
think
is
difficult
to
understand.
on
june
4th
when
the
violation
was
charged,
the
only
standard
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation
was
this
visual
opacity
reading,
at
the
end
of
june,
1st
of
july,
a
law
became
effective
which
permitted
a
person
accused
for
violation
at
his
own
expense
make
a
particular
test
which
is
more
expensive
and
more
difficult.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
well,
you
could
not
obviously
do
it
--
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
no,
not
unless
you
knew
about
it,
and
have
the
equipment
in
place
to
do
it.
the
problem
here
of
course,
we
felt
so,
we
were
taken
advantage
of
that
we
did
not
know
until
two
weeks
afterwards,
there
may
be
analogy
there
and
elsewhere.
it's
like
receiving
a
citation
in
the
mail
that
two
weeks
ago
you
observed
speeding
on
a
highway,
it
is
pretty
hard
to
remember
just
what
you
were
doing
two
weeks
ago
although
you
get
a
ticket
right
now,
you
probably
know
right
now
whether
you
were
violating
or
weren't
violating.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
no,
i
do
not
find
it
there,
i
agree.
they
excluded
it
because
the
staff
of
the
department
had
not
approved
of
the
method
of
taking
nor
the
correlation
that
existed
between
particular
and
visual.
that
has
to
kind
of
remain
unanswered,
what
the
effect
the
would
have
been
of
a
later
test.
we
had
the
impression
with
discussion
that
you
could
see
that
we
were
not
getting
very
far
in
talking
about
later
tests.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
well,
then
you
are
expected
if
you
were
denied
of
variance
and
you
of
course
operate
in
violation,
you
would
be
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order
and
if
you
violated
that
you
would
be
subject
to
criminal
penalties.
now
we
had
a
little
confusion
in
this
case.
the
board
denied
western,
a
variance
when
it
hadn't
actually
asked
for
one.
i
think
they
admitted
their
error
in
that,
when
western
was
charged
with
this
violation
it
came
in
and
said
we
are
not
guilty.
and
the
hearing
was
held
on
that
basis.
well
the
board
said
you
are
guilty
and
you
can't
have
a
variance,
well
there
had
not
been
any
variance
hearing
and
this
was
i
think
more
of
procedural
mix-up
than
anything
else
and
nothing
further
came
up.
one
other
fractional
matter,
i
would
like
to
--
i
do
have
something
organized
here,
i
will
get
to
in
a
minute,
but
one
other
fractional
matter,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
is
mr.
tucker's
statement
that
this
could
have
been
seen
from
the
highway
or
the
charge
could
have
been
made
from
the
highway
or
put
from
a
nearby
open
field.
we
don't
know
that.
we
know
that
he
entered
the
premises.
we
know
that
he
felt
he
must
enter
the
premises
or
else
he
presumably
could
have
taken
the
judgment,
the
readings
from
a
highway
or
a
nearby
open
field.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
they
are
highly
visible.
as
the
record
indicates
here
at
times.
it's
the
drying
operation
that
a
22000
gallons
of
water
dried
in
hour
through
this
gas
fired
drier
and
they
put
up
huge
belows
of
steam
frequently,
particularly
in
the
early
morning
hours.
but
there
is
a
lot
of
water
evaporated
and
you
can
sometimes
as
one
of
these
pictures
show
even
from
a
good
distance
away.
the
inspector
in
one
place
or
another
in
the
record
here
talks
about
what
he
judges
it
because
of
the
blue
haze
trailing
off
after
the
steam
has
evaporated.
well,
that
can't
be
done
from
a
long
ways
away,
i
submit.
and
apparently,
the
inspector
didn't
feel
it
to
be
done
from
a
long
ways
away.
the
state
must
feel
it
is
important
to
be
on
the
premises
or
we
even
wouldn't
be
right
here
now.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
pardon.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
so
far
as
the
record
shows.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
that's
right.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
i
am
saying
that
we
--
the
point
seem
to
be
being
made
that
he
could
have
seen
this
violation
without
having
been
on
the
premises
and
therefore,
because
he
came
on
the
premises,
there
can't
be
any
fourth
amendment
violation
or
need
to
give
notice
or
anything
like
that.
i
think
my
point
is,
if
in
fact
these
observations
had
been
made
off
of
the
premises,
we
wouldn't
have
anything
really
here
to
talk
about.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
i
am
concerned
and
i
suppose,
in
my
way
could
be
put
that
way,
justice
marshall,
i
think
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
--.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
i
don't
care,
the
law
has
been
changed
in
colorado.
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
this
case
is
moot.
the
law
now
requires
that
there
a
consent
or
warrant
could
be
obtained.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
but
i
don't
know
how
in
the
world
denying
a
variance,
finding
a
violation
i
think
is,--
no
we
didn't
even
ask
for
a
variance.
well,
it
didn't
--.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
yeah.
i
would
like
to
come
to
that
in
just
a
minute
here
if
i
can.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
no,
i
really
wasn't
going
to
address
that
the
substantial
evidence
thing
right
away.
i
think
my
strongest
point
is
two
cases
decided
by
justice
white
in
1967,
camara
v.
municipal
court
and
i
don't
know
why
we
haven't
talked
more
about
them
by
this
time.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
this
is
written
by,
i
am
sorry,
authored
by
–
decided
by
the
court.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
they
were
not
corporations.
one
was
the
business
and
one
was
an
individual.
the
significance
of
the
see
case
was
that
a
businessman
with
respect
to
his
private
property
as
just
fundamental
right
as
a
individual
with
respect
to
his
house.
but
there
is
no
distinction
between
a
business
interest
owned
by
an
individual,
true
and
his
own
residence,
neither
involved
a
corporation.
these
two
cases
did
hold
though
that
administrative
search
of
private
property
whether
it,
residence
or
business,
without
proper
consent
is
per
se
unreasonable,
and
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
if
no
search
warrant
has
been
obtained
except
in
certain
special
circumstances
which
the
court
discussed
in
these
two
cases.
we
impliedly
all
the
way
through
here,
the
state
seems
to
be
arguing
these
two
cases
don't
apply
or
shouldn't
apply.
they
offered
a
number
of
grounds
in
that
respect.
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
on
just
what
the
search
inspection
was
here.
we
do
know,
as
justice
marshall
points
out
that
the
inspector
did
go
on
the
premises.
he
didn't
want
for
affiliation,
he
didn't
go
on
for
cup
of
coffee,
he
went
on
there
to
get
evidence
this
time.
he
was
there
at
least
ten
minutes,
may
have
been
more.
the
epa
indicates,
he
should
be
there
30
minutes
to
make
the
proper
ringelmann
examination.
he
did
take
pictures.
the
state
for
reasons
known
to
it
decided
not
to
introduce
those
pictures
in
support
of
the
state's
case.
the
inspector
said
i
believe
that
they
really
don't
show
anything.
i
don't
think
they
do.
i
have
put
them
in
because
i
think
to
demonstrate
the
steam
and
so
forth.
this
did
constitute
a
search,
i
believe
as
record
said
in
cax
(ph)
case
involving
the
telephone
booth,
that
the
fourth
amendment
not
only
stands
through
the
seizure
of
tangible
things
but
also
extends
to
intangibles
such
as,
in
that
case,
a
recording
of
a
conversation.
i
am
sure
a
photograph
would
be
searched.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
well,
it
had
to
somewhere.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
what
was
being
emitted
from
this
equipment
and
plant
of
a
--
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
no.
it
certainly
didn't.
he
was
responsible
for
it,
i
agree
but
it
didn't
belong
to
the
plant.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
no.
the
inspector
took
a
metal
image
of
it,
took
a
picture
of
it.
i
don't
think
a
search
is
any
lesser
search
because
of
a
--
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
well,
it
was
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
not
raised
and
no
proper
record
was
made
before
the
variance
board.
i
would
like
to
be
quite
candid
that
i
found
an
awful
lot
about
search
and
seizure
and
the
whole
course
of
this
argument
than
i
ever
knew
before
i
started
in
this
case
and
there
are
--
it's
unfortunate
that
record
is
not
more
complete
than
it
could
have
been.
the
evidence
itself,
that
we
are
talking
about
--
here
is
the
degree
of
opacity
of
this
particular
emission.
it
would
be
ideal,
a
fact
could
be
preserved
and
brought
into
court,
of
course
it
can't
be.
pictures,
what
i
suppose
could
be,
if
i
show
something
it
happened,
the
pictures
here
didn't
show
anything.
second
best
evidence
is
what
we
had
here,
the
visual
description
of
what
the
inspector
saw.
i
think,
the
government
conceded
in
this
brief,
that
if
particular
measuring
equipment
had
been
installed
the
results
of
that
would
have
been
searched,
it
could
have
been
brought
into
court.
i
don't
think
it's
any
less
of
the
search
because
the
method
of
observation
of
reporting
the
evidence
in
a
sense
approved.
the
inspector
apparently
felt
it
necessary
to
go
on
the
premises
and
i
have
said
that
the
state
now
feels
that's
why
i
defend
his
going
on
the
premises.
at
one
point
in
this
case,
the
argument
was
made
that
the
open
fields
doctrine
prevents
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
here.
well,
perhaps
it
would,
if
we
had
a
factual
background
to
apply
to.
these
observations
were
not
made
from
an
open
filed,
we
do
know
that.
they
were
made
from
the
premises,
we
don't
know
much
about
the
nature
of
the
premises
whether
they
are
open
to
the
public
or
not,
there
is
no
indication.
the
federal
justice
department
refers
to
the
fact
that
there
was
no
fence
around.
questions
asked
was
there
any
sign
of
it.
well
i
submit
that,
to
ensure
your
privacy
it
is
not
necessary
to
put
up
a
fence,
to
ensure
that
you
won’t
be
intruded
upon
with
unnecessary
investigations,
it
should
not
be
necessary
to
put
up
signs
or
hire
dogs
to
keep
people
off.
we
don’t
know,
there
does
not
appear
to
be
a
fence
involved,
we
don’t
know
where
he
was
on
the
premises.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
this
comes
in
to
the
plain
view
doctrine,
i
mean
you
cannot
ignore
what
is
in
plain
view.
i
think
that
is
where
we
have
to
seek
the
answer
to
this.
certainly,
anybody
whether
a
police
officer
or
not,
you
got
a
right
to
walk
up
and
on
out
of
the
grocery
store
and
see
what
is
showing
there.
the
extent
to
which
you
expect
a
person
to
be
there
and
see
what
they
are
seeing,
i
think
is
important.
the
court
addressed
itself
most
recently
to
i
think
what
this
problem
was
in
the
coolidge
case
versus
new
hampshire.
it
was
in
that
case
that
in
discussing
what
may
be
in
plain
view
that
a
couple
of
limitations
were
discussed
by
the
court.
first
of
all,
they
indicated
that
the
officer
involved
should
have
a
prior
justification
for
being
whether
it
was
a
legitimate
reason
to
be
there
unconnected
with
the
search
that
is
being
made.
it
reiterated
again
the
case
did
that
plain
view
doctrine
did
not
--
it
was
still
true
that
no
intrusion
is
justified
without
a
careful
determination
of
necessity
and
that
the
discovery
of
the
evidence
involved
must
be
an
inadvertency
that
where
you
go
on
to
a
person’s
property
looking
for
something
as
the
inspector
did
here
knowing
that
he
was
going
to
make
a
search,
it
can
be
hardly
said
that
what
he
found
was
--
he
justified
because
it
was
in
plain
view.
i
think
in
this
case
or
one
another
one
similar
to
it
the
court
indicated
that
if
you
poke
around
long
enough
you
can
always
find
something
in
plain
view.
that
is
about
as
closest
i
can
get
to
what
that
problem
is
and
the
answers
i
found
by
this
court.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
yes,
some
time
ago
and
still
standing
as
good
law
in
this
court
as
far
as
i
can
determine
but
we
don’t
seem
to
be
having
an
open
field
here
from
what
the
observation
were
made,
the
case
would
be
very
simple
if
we
did.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
yeah.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
yeah
there
were
lot
of
stales
discovered
in
those
days.
it
may
or
may
not
have
been
in
plain
view
and
i
think
a
lot
of
law
was
made
on
that
account.
i
don’t
think
the
present
status
for
our
law
would
allow
revenue
agent
to
go
pocking
around
in
my
backyard
or
somebody
else’s
field
to
see
if
he
can
find
it
still
tucked
away
behind
the
lilac
bush.
i
do
not
believe
our
law
presently
permits
that
in
recent
decisions
of
this
court.
perhaps
it
may
have
been
different
in
the
twenties.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
where
there
is
smoke
there
is
stale.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
i
understand
that
the
inspector
came
on
lawfully
with
the
warrant
or
otherwise
looking
for
something
else
and
found
a
stale.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
i
think
in
a
technical
sense,
these
things
can
always
be
pushed
to
a
line
where
they
seem
ridiculous.
i
think
these
cases
have
said
that
any
invasion
of
property,
any
intrusion
without
judiciary
view
in
advance
accept
in
certain
circumstances
which
we
can
get
to
is
prohibited
by
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
camara
and
see
have
said
that,
most
of
the
time
has
been
spent
in
what
these
exceptions
are.
the
case
of
cax
(ph)
approached
this
problem
that
we
both
have
been
discussing
now.
a
minimal
invasion
and
in
that
case
the
court
allowed
that
here
they
were
over
hanging
a
conversion
in
the
phone
booth,
but
this
was
about
as
minimal
invasion
of
privacy
as
you
can
have,
but
still
this
was
forbidden
under
restriction
of
the
fourth
amendment
because
there
had
not
been
a
prior
judiciary
view
of
the
invasion
of
privacy
which
occurred
in
making
that
search.
now
these
fine
lines
are
always
difficult
but
i
would
have
to
say
that
perhaps
approaches
what
we
are
talking
about.
we
were
on
the
coolidge
case
and
the
plain
view
doctrine
and
a
number
of
other
statements
made
by
the
court
in
that
case
in
connection
with
the
right
of
privacy
and
so
forth.
i
would
like
to
return
a
minute
to
the
camara
and
see
cases
what
were
important
in
the
particular
context
of
saying
that
these
restrictions
imposed
by
the
fourth
amendment
to
secure
privacy
and
guard
against
intrusions
apply
with
equal
force
to
administrative
inspectors
as
they
do
to
police
officers,
that
and
pointing
out
in
that
case
that
the
additional
body
of
law
that
has
developed
out
side
of
earlier
traditions
which
is
involved
with
these
administrative
type
of
compliance
inspections
and
so
forth.
certainly
in
this
day
and
age
that
we
are
in
now
we
are
coming
into
more
and
more
environmental
matters
particularly.
and
i
think
the
court
was
concerned
in
these
cases
in
1967
that
the
people
enforcing
these
laws
were
not
going
to
be
as
concerned
with
or
they
weren't
aware
that
they
should
be
as
concerned
with
rights
of
privacy
and
security
as
in
the
conventional
law
enforcement
lay.
that
is
import
of
these
cases
is
same
to
fire
inspector,
building
inspectors
and
so
forth.
you
have
to
just
as
concerned
about
rights
of
individuals
as
people
involved
in
more
direct
criminal
activities.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
alright.
i
would
like
to
do
something
about
this.
colonnade
is
a
little
like
the
situation
we
have
here
where
the
inspectors
were
denied
access
to
a
liquor
stock,
i
believe
it
was
and
forced
their
way
in
and
ceased
the
liquor
stock
which
indeed
was
improperly
labeled
bottles.
justice
douglas
offered
the
opinion
in
that
case
suppressed
that
evidence.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
i
don’t
know
i
think
the
court
--
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
biswell.
involved
as
court
is
aware,
a
situation
of
a
business
man
who
desired
to
go
in
to
a
business
involving
sale
and
distribution
of
guns
requiring
him
to
obtain
a
license
knowing
that
it
was
a
pervasively
regulated
business.
i
think
was
the
language
of
the
court
and
that
he
would
indeed
be
subject
to
investigations
and
investigations
made
without
a
warrant.
now,
i
think
biswell
is
a
quick
a
bit
different
situation
than
we
have
here.
i
am
surprised
that
it
hasn't
come
up
earlier
in
our
discussion,
but,
of
course
there
is
no
federal
license
involved.
there
is
no
license
at
all
involved
in
operating
in
alfalfa
dehydrating
plant.
anybody
can
start
and
it's
a
necessary
adjunct
to
the
agricultural
economy
of
the
area.
instead
of
baling
it
and
selling
it
they
dry
it,
palletize
it
and
sack
it
and
sell
it.
no
license
is
necessary,
there
are
no
regulations
applicable
to
the
business
other
than
regulations
that
all
of
us
are
subject
to
in
terms
of
fire
code,
building
code,
zoning
and
so
forth.
air
pollution
which
we
are
all
subject
to.
there
are
no
regulations
unique
to
the
business
as
in
the
gun
control
act
and
in
biswell
case.
i
don’t
think
there
is
anything
can
be
drawn
from
that
saying
that
the
exception
made
from
camara
and
see
by
biswell
should
be
extended
to
this
situation.
i
see
no
rationale
for
it.
colonnade,
to
return
to
that
for
just
for
a
minute.
there
the
evidence
was
gathered,
was
suppressed
because
there
was
no
statutory
scheme
set
forth
for
warrant
less
inspections.
i
think
as
i
look
at
the
statute
involved
in
that
case,
i
find
it
identical
to
statute
to
colorado
in
this
case,
entry
is
authorized
but
no
scheme
involved,
no
requirement
for
identification,
no
limitation
on
time,
no
limitation
on
scope.
the
court
in
that
situation
said
there
may
be
a
statuary
scheme
authorizing
entry
without
warrant
but
as
long
as
no
particulars
are
spelled
out,
no
limitations
are
spelled
out
the
requirements
of
fourth
amendment
still
apply.
well
the
same
could
be
said
in
this
situation.
now,
throughout
the
course
of
briefing
and
argument
in
this
case
there
have
been
a
number
of
remarks
about
the
burden
of
obtaining
a
search
warrant.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
we
should
realize
that
the
warrant
is
going
to
be
an
isolated
situation,
i
think
mr.
tucker
indicated
most
people.
no
percentage
was
given
but
most
people
in
the
situation
or
person
identified
themselves
is
according
to
the
law
of
the
inspection.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
you
are
going
to
walk
in
where
you
want
on
this
person’s
premises
as
this
inspector
did.
he
had
to
go
from
one
location
to
another
to
get
the
sun
and
the
wind
and
so
forth
in
the
right
place.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
i
believe
it
was
justice
marshall.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
as
to
the
nature
of
the
premises
that
is
all
it
was,
whether
it
was
a
parking
lot
or
whether
it
was
open
to
the
public
or
otherwise
that
is
all
it
said,
the
record
did
say
that
he
moved
from
one
location
to
another
on
the
premises.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
what
was
going
into
them?
yes,
i
was
talking
about
search
warrant,
would
this
have
hindered,
would
this
requirement
hinder
making
these
type
of
inspections,
most
of
the
time
now
people
will
--
if
the
consent
is
withheld
you
go
on
–
the
inspector
goes
on
and
identifies
himself,
consent
is
withheld,
then
the
inspector
has
got
to
decide.
well
can
i
do
it
from
the
open
field?
go
over
and
stand
over
there
and
get
my
job
done
or
is
it
necessary,
i
be
here
on
the
premises
and
i
think
camara
and
see
require
that
if
he
must
be
on
the
premises,
if
he
is
going
to
intrude
for
the
purpose
of
gathering
the
evidence,
go
get
a
warrant.
there
has
been
some
talk
that
the
timeliness
is
needed
and
so
forth.
in
colorado
rule
41,
a
warrant
--
there
is
no
limitation
on
how
good
long,
you
can
get
a
warrant
for.
for
a
reasonable
time,
because
we
can
one
–
lasts
for
two
weeks.
anytime
you
go
by,
you
are
ready
to
go
there
with
a
warrant
and
if
you
have
any
reason
to
be
--
if
you
think
you
are
going
to
refused
get
your
warrant
before
you
go.
there
is
indication
for
example,
on
this
case,
inspector
setting
on
this
june
4th
morning,
june
6th
to
visit
these
three
plants
and
issue
citations;
he
could
have
taken
a
warrant
along
with
him,
the
result
of
the
case
would
have
been
exactly
the
same.
the
evidence
would
have
been
the
same.
i
don’t
think
that
he
said
that
the
lack
of
his
having
to
get
a
warrant
would
have
impeded
his
activity.
we
have
talked
about
system
indeed
all
the
way
through
this
that
the
accused
should
have
notice
of
the
inspector
being
there.
now,
aside
from
this
affording
the
right
to
object
to
an
inspection
being
made,
evidence
being
gathered,
i
think
it
should
be
noticed
that
this
is
not
an
uncommon
statutory
scheme
as
referred
to
in
the
government's
brief,
generously
provided
with
more
example
than
i
could
have
thought
of,
where
the
credentials
must
be
shown
before
you
can
go
on.
indeed,
the
federal
clean
air
act
for
just
these
types
of
inspections;
federal
water
pollution
act
and
mine
safety
act;
all
require
that
before
you
make
an
inspection,
you
show
your
credentials.
this
is
not
uncommon.
the
colorado
law
as
it
now
reads,
you
must
get
consent
or
a
warrant.
well,
obviously
you
can
get
consent
even
you
don’t
even
ask.
the
person
doesn’t
know
you
are
there.
so,
in
effect
it
requires
you
to
come
up
and
give
notice
that
you
are
there.
a
curious
example,
speaking
of
the
colorado
law
is
that
if
you
are
going
to
take
a
tangible
sample
of
whatever
you
have
looked
at
in
air
pollution,
you
are
required
to
give
it
to
the
person
you
took
it
from.
this
is
strange
that
the
colorado
law
says
that
if
you
are
going
to
take
a
visual
impression
of
whatever
you
are
charging
the
evidence
of,
there
is
no
requirement
that
person
from
whom
or
on
whose
property
you
take
this
visual
impression,
hasn’t
got
a
right
to
be
there
simultaneously
and
look
at
the
same
thing.
look,
this
is
what
i
want
to
charge
you
with.
that's
all
we
have
asked
in
this
case.
so,
you
would
have
a
chance
to
look
yourself
and
see
what
is
there,
have
some
way
of
answering.
we
did
complain
somewhat
bitterly
and
maybe
at
too
much
length
and
our
people
going
to
the
smoke
school
run
by
the
state
of
colorado;
we
are
not
certified
that
they
were
competent,
that
they
have
taken
the
smoke
schools
so
that
they
could
testify
with
the
same
degree
of
credibility,
the
state
inspectors
did,
but
perhaps
the
point
is
we
had
no
opportunity
to
look
at
that
dissipating,
evanescent,
here
and
now
and
gone
for
ever
evidence
that
violation
is
based
on.
we
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
in
our
brief
talking
about
the
constitutional
adequacy
of
the
ringelmann
test;
i
don’t
propose
to
go
into
that
in
greater
detail.
then
the
court
by
its
questions
as
indicated
is
concerned
with
sufficiency
of
that
as
a
test.
we
did
direct
the
court's
attentions
and
perhaps
we
have
already
--
the
situation
in
the
pennsylvania
power
case,
i
only
have
the
report
in
the
environmental
law
reporter
and
state
implementation
plan
was
turned
down
by
the
federal
court
appeals.
because
the
instrument
of
enforcement
was
the
ringelmann
test.
and
i
am
sure
that
case
was
going
to
end
up
here
before
it
is
finished
because
as
justice
department
of
attorney
indicated
this
is
a
very
common
provision
in
these
implementations
plans.
there
is
a
crude
test
granted
as
quick,
speedy,
hit
it
and
go
sort
of
thing,
but
it
is
not
a
very
good
indication
of
how
much
actual
emissions,
pollutants
if
you
please
are
involved.
i
can’t
help
but
think
is
important
that
the
colorado
law
has
changed
since
this
all
came
up
and
as
mr.
tucker
has
indicated
they
can’t
do
what
they
are
trying
to
justify
and
urge
this
court,
they
should
be
able
to
do
even
now
under
colorado
law.
it
makes
this
me
wonder
why
we
are
here.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
state
petition
for
certiorari,
i
am
here
because
i
was
called
here.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
i
think
the
effect
of
a
reversal
by
this
court
of
what
the
colorado
court
has
done
would
be
a
very
open
invitation
to
all
people
engaged
in
this
area
of
law
enforcement
that
you
can
go
on
when
you
want
to
without
telling
anybody
and
make
your
investigations
in
secret
and
advise
them
later.
how
much
later
is
up
to
you,
of
what
you
have
found
and
leave
them
to
their
own
devices
as
to
how
to
defend.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
i
think
justivce
white
the
appeals
court
grounded
its
decision
on
two
things,
on
due
process,
fundamental
requirements
of
procedural
due
process;
that
would
be
a
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
it
did,
it
grounded
almost
the
same
language
as
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
did
was.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
those
fundamental
elements
of
due
process,
i
think
that's
bogged
the
way
i
referred
to
it.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
yes,
i
think
it
is
and
this
indeed
we
do
and
of
course,
court
of
appeals
carried
it
one
step
forward.
i
think
as
i
found
in
going
into
this
case
further
and
further,
this
notice
argument
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
does
tend
to
lead
you
right
into
the
search
problem
under
the
fourth
amendment,
identifying
yourself,
letting
it
be
known
what
is
going
on,
giving
a
chance
to
either
object
or
nothing
else
to
be
able
to
defend.
my
time
is
well
up.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
thank
you
justice
douglas.
i
think
to
answer
your
question
that
you
asked
earlier
mr.
justice
white,
the
fact
that
there
was
a
trespass,
doesn't
make
any
difference,
says
this
court
articulate
in
the
katz
case
and
the
court
said,
assuming
that
the
officers
were
both
trespassers
and
lacking
in
probable
cause,
fourth
amendments
protections
do
not
extend
to
the
open
field
area
surrounding
a
dwelling
and
the
immediate
adjacent
curtilage
and
therefore
information
gained
as
a
result
of
a
civil
trespass
on
open
field
is
not
constitutionally
obtained.
the
pictures
and
the
testimony
of
inspector
tailor
show
that
he
observed
this
plume
of
smoke
before
he
was
actually
on
the
premises
of
western
alfalfa.
he
had
justifiable
cause
to
enter
on
to
the
premises
and
obtain
the
evidence
which
he
did
and
that
was
an
opacity
reading
of
the
smoke
plume
or
the
plume
which
they
were
putting
in
to
the
atmosphere.
counsel
has
stated
in
his
argument
that
the
evidence
would
be
the
same
if
a
warrant
had
been
obtained
and
that
is
exactly
correct
and
therefore
a
warrant
would
serve
no
useful
purpose.
if
the
state
had
had
a
warrant
or
had
obtained
consent,
the
evidence
would
be
exactly
the
same
because
western
alfalfa
or
none
of
these
operations
have
a
trained
smoke
carrier
on
the
premises.
they
would
not
have
been
able
to
take
opacity
readings
of
their
own
on
that
particular
day
and
in
fact
after
they
received
the
cease-and-desist
order,
some
twelve
days
later,
they
still
didn’t
take
any
opacity
readings.
so
consent
or
a
warrant
would
not
change
the
fact
situation
at
all
and
would
not
change
the
evidence.
so,
it
is
a
useless
gesture
to
require
the
state
to
go
through
the
process
of
obtaining
a
warrant.
the
inspector
here
was
merely
observing
what
was
being
put
into
atmosphere
for
anyone
who
desired
to
look,
to
see.
the
due
process
question
is
no
different
than
an
individual
who
is
speedy.
now
counsel
has
used
this
as
an
example,
you
are
not
warned
by
an
officer
prior
to
your
speeding
that
he
is
going
to
observe
you
and
if
you
speed,
you
are
going
to
get
a
ticket.
he
stops
you
after
the
fact.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
that
is
correct,
but
what
western
is
complaining
about
here
is
they
are
saying,
we
did
not
have
notice
at
the
time
so
that
we
could
have
an
independent
observer
present.
you
are
not
or
you
do
not
have
any
right
to
have
an
independent
observer
present
on
the
highway
so
that
you
have
an
independent
third
party
to
testify
against
the
officer
saying,
you
were
not
speeding.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
no,
but
that's
not
the
fault
of
the
public.
both
of
the
laws
are
to
protect
the
public
interest
of
welfare
and
safety.
that
is
you
must
operate
your
car
on
the
highways
in
a
manner
that
you
do
not
endanger
the
safety
of
the
other
people
using
the
highway.
western
alfalfa
cannot
use
the
atmosphere
in
a
manner
that
it
endangers
the
health
and
safety
of
the
rest
of
the
public.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
they
require
a
plant
to
submit
a
plan
for
whereby
they
are
going
to
bring
their
operation
under
compliance
and
they
have
a
choice
of
numerous
equipment
that
can
be
installed
on
the
plant
to
either
catch
the
particulate
matter
before
it
escapes
into
the
atmosphere
or
some
manner
to
prevent
it
from
going
in
to
that.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
that's
correct
well,
sulphur
of
course
would
be
a
more
toxic
material
and
they
would
not
be
allowed
to
allow
that
to
escape
into
the
atmosphere.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
donald
d.
cawelti.
i
am
the
attorney
for
the
respondent
and
have
been
through
these
longs
proceedings.
i
have
some
remarks
that
i
would
like
to
proceed
with
in
some
order,
but
i
think
particularly
in
view
of
the
questions
that
have
been
addressed
to
the
court;
i
would
like
very
much
to
point
out
what
this
record
shows
and
what
it
does
not
show.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
no,
it
is
been
ongoing,
i
would
not
characterize
it
as
a
controversy.
justice
white,
this
was
mr.
tucker
that
this
has
been
going
on
for
some
two
years
previous
in
this
implied
consent
discussions
we
had.
certainly
these
personnel
from
the
enforcement
department
of
division
of
health
had
been
on
western's
premises
during,
i
believe
two
seasons
previous
to
this
hearing.
this
was
during
that
period
of
time
which
is
referred
to
in
the
statue
as
the
conference
conciliation
and
persuasion
phase
of
enforcement.
they
were
on
there,
announced
their
presence,
discussed
what
was
going
on,
suggested
improvements,
this
is
all
shown
in
the
record
and
indeed
as
the
inspector
admitted,
substantial
improvements
have
been
made.
they
were
looking
much
better.
in
fact
i
think
they
had
in
view
of
the
remarks
they
have
made
tended
to
western
into
a
sense,
particularly
with
mr.
roning's
report
of
their
own
examiners,
that
they
were
in
compliance
or
very
close
to
compliance.
so
this
had
been
going
on
in
a
very
cooperative
way,
i
think
the
records
shows
for
these
previous
two
years.
these
two
years
before
they
were
on
that,
they
were
not
there
to
gather
evidence
when
they
came
on
the
premises.
they
were
there
in
conference
and
conciliation.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
i
don’t
recall
that
remark
in
the
context,
it
was
made
in
mr.
justice
douglas.
we
did
deny
in
a
number
of
places
throughout
the
record
that
--
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
well,
it
was
clear
that
staff
of
the
enforcement
people
did
feel
that.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
well
the
staff
was
insisting
right
at
this
not
--
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
no,
the
staff
was
saying
right
at
this
hearing,
where
i
made
this
remark
that
there
were
violations
and
i
expect
my
remark
was
made
in
that
context,
i
expect
the
staff
to
continue
with
that
expression.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
here
is
what
we
offered
which
is
pretty
always
–
we
thought
we
could
--
that
they
had
been
out
there
the
year
before
in
1967
and
observed
very
marginal
violations
40%
to
50%
at
these
plants.
the
violation
being
40
%
we
offer
an
evidence,
they
had
written
the
following
summer
of
1968,
that
they
had
noted
marked
improvement
in
the
operation
of
the
plants.
we
offered
the
evidence
of
mr.
roning's
examination
that
following
fall
in
1968,
finding
them
in
compliance
with
visual
standards.
this
was
all
before
the
critical
june
4th
date.
we
offered
the
results
of
particular
examination
made,
august
following
the
june
when
the
state
was
out
there
showing
that
from
a
particular
point
of
view,
they
were
in
compliance
and
i
do
disagree
with
mr.
tucker's
remark
that
this
state
would
entertain
evidence
as
to
what
occurred
after
june
4th.
i
would
like
to
refer
to
page
77
of
the
record
or
i
had
myself
in
exchange
with
mr.
heaton,
one
of
the
board
members
he
stated,
let
me
talk
about
the
moot
law
on
june
4th,
the
specific
law
on
june
4th.
as
the
law
reads
on
that
date
or
on
the
june
16th
could
you
have
been
in
violation,
i
replied,
yes,
our
own
view
is
we
were
not,
in
our
own
testimony,
as
we
were
not.
mr.
heaton
stated
to
me,
no
your
testimony
was
in
fact
that
you
were
in
violation
in
august.
i
do
not
have
a
date
of
that
report,
let
me
just
correct,
it
was
august.
and
so
far
your
testimony
is
that
you
did
not
think
you
are
in
violation
of
the
law
on
that
date.
and
there
is
another
reference
in
there
but
i
could
not
find
it
during
--
since
this
came
up
there
is
in
one
of
the
records
somewhere
that
june
4th
was
their
date.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
when
this
went
to
the
district
court,
about
the
only
thing
that
we
did
have
a
evidentiary
hearing,
the
only
that
hearing
was
concerned
with
was
the
adequacy
and
constitutional
validity
of
the
ringelmann
test.
we
did
not
try
to
rehash
or
i
think
we
were
permitted
to
introduce
further
evidence
that
the
variance
board
did
not
consider.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
not
very
much.
the
only
thing
that
was
in
the
record,
the
department
of
attorney
was
correct.
we
do
not
have
any
–
there
is
no
reference
to
the
parking
lot
in
the
record,
nowhere.
that
expression
isn't
in
the
record.
where
this
comes
from
in
the
briefs
and
arguments,
i
have
no
idea.
the
record
all
it
says
is
the
observation
were
made
by
an
entry
to
the
premises
of
the
western.
there's
nothing
further
than
that.
unfortunately
perhaps,
but
that
is
all
it
says.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
no
it's
not
fair
tribute
to
mr
heaton
where
other
board
members
may
have
felt
but
not
said.
he
happened
to
be
a
more
outspoken
member
of
the
board
as
the
record
shows.
the
decision
of
the
board
itself
on
the
violation
on
the
dating
question,
i
think
that
will
be
shown
in
the
appendix.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
yes,
i
think
that
was
attached
to
the
original
petition
for
cert.
it
is
not
in
the
appendix
but
attached
to
the
original
petition
and
that
refers
to
the
date
--
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
that
is
what
we
tried,
board
apparently
did
not
accept
it.
it
took
the
visual
observations
made
on
june
4th
in
preference
to
the
--
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
yes,
there
was
a
confused
period
of
time
here
involved
that
i
think
is
difficult
to
understand.
on
june
4th
when
the
violation
was
charged,
the
only
standard
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
a
violation
was
this
visual
opacity
reading,
at
the
end
of
june,
1st
of
july,
a
law
became
effective
which
permitted
a
person
accused
for
violation
at
his
own
expense
make
a
particular
test
which
is
more
expensive
and
more
difficult.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
well,
you
could
not
obviously
do
it
--
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
no,
not
unless
you
knew
about
it,
and
have
the
equipment
in
place
to
do
it.
the
problem
here
of
course,
we
felt
so,
we
were
taken
advantage
of
that
we
did
not
know
until
two
weeks
afterwards,
there
may
be
analogy
there
and
elsewhere.
it's
like
receiving
a
citation
in
the
mail
that
two
weeks
ago
you
observed
speeding
on
a
highway,
it
is
pretty
hard
to
remember
just
what
you
were
doing
two
weeks
ago
although
you
get
a
ticket
right
now,
you
probably
know
right
now
whether
you
were
violating
or
weren't
violating.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
no,
i
do
not
find
it
there,
i
agree.
they
excluded
it
because
the
staff
of
the
department
had
not
approved
of
the
method
of
taking
nor
the
correlation
that
existed
between
particular
and
visual.
that
has
to
kind
of
remain
unanswered,
what
the
effect
the
would
have
been
of
a
later
test.
we
had
the
impression
with
discussion
that
you
could
see
that
we
were
not
getting
very
far
in
talking
about
later
tests.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
well,
then
you
are
expected
if
you
were
denied
of
variance
and
you
of
course
operate
in
violation,
you
would
be
issue
a
cease
and
desist
order
and
if
you
violated
that
you
would
be
subject
to
criminal
penalties.
now
we
had
a
little
confusion
in
this
case.
the
board
denied
western,
a
variance
when
it
hadn't
actually
asked
for
one.
i
think
they
admitted
their
error
in
that,
when
western
was
charged
with
this
violation
it
came
in
and
said
we
are
not
guilty.
and
the
hearing
was
held
on
that
basis.
well
the
board
said
you
are
guilty
and
you
can't
have
a
variance,
well
there
had
not
been
any
variance
hearing
and
this
was
i
think
more
of
procedural
mix-up
than
anything
else
and
nothing
further
came
up.
one
other
fractional
matter,
i
would
like
to
--
i
do
have
something
organized
here,
i
will
get
to
in
a
minute,
but
one
other
fractional
matter,
i
would
like
to
address
myself
to
is
mr.
tucker's
statement
that
this
could
have
been
seen
from
the
highway
or
the
charge
could
have
been
made
from
the
highway
or
put
from
a
nearby
open
field.
we
don't
know
that.
we
know
that
he
entered
the
premises.
we
know
that
he
felt
he
must
enter
the
premises
or
else
he
presumably
could
have
taken
the
judgment,
the
readings
from
a
highway
or
a
nearby
open
field.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
they
are
highly
visible.
as
the
record
indicates
here
at
times.
it's
the
drying
operation
that
a
22000
gallons
of
water
dried
in
hour
through
this
gas
fired
drier
and
they
put
up
huge
belows
of
steam
frequently,
particularly
in
the
early
morning
hours.
but
there
is
a
lot
of
water
evaporated
and
you
can
sometimes
as
one
of
these
pictures
show
even
from
a
good
distance
away.
the
inspector
in
one
place
or
another
in
the
record
here
talks
about
what
he
judges
it
because
of
the
blue
haze
trailing
off
after
the
steam
has
evaporated.
well,
that
can't
be
done
from
a
long
ways
away,
i
submit.
and
apparently,
the
inspector
didn't
feel
it
to
be
done
from
a
long
ways
away.
the
state
must
feel
it
is
important
to
be
on
the
premises
or
we
even
wouldn't
be
right
here
now.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
pardon.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
so
far
as
the
record
shows.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
that's
right.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
i
am
saying
that
we
--
the
point
seem
to
be
being
made
that
he
could
have
seen
this
violation
without
having
been
on
the
premises
and
therefore,
because
he
came
on
the
premises,
there
can't
be
any
fourth
amendment
violation
or
need
to
give
notice
or
anything
like
that.
i
think
my
point
is,
if
in
fact
these
observations
had
been
made
off
of
the
premises,
we
wouldn't
have
anything
really
here
to
talk
about.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
i
am
concerned
and
i
suppose,
in
my
way
could
be
put
that
way,
justice
marshall,
i
think
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
--.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
i
don't
care,
the
law
has
been
changed
in
colorado.
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
this
case
is
moot.
the
law
now
requires
that
there
a
consent
or
warrant
could
be
obtained.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
but
i
don't
know
how
in
the
world
denying
a
variance,
finding
a
violation
i
think
is,--
no
we
didn't
even
ask
for
a
variance.
well,
it
didn't
--.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
yeah.
i
would
like
to
come
to
that
in
just
a
minute
here
if
i
can.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
no,
i
really
wasn't
going
to
address
that
the
substantial
evidence
thing
right
away.
i
think
my
strongest
point
is
two
cases
decided
by
justice
white
in
1967,
camara
v.
municipal
court
and
i
don't
know
why
we
haven't
talked
more
about
them
by
this
time.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
this
is
written
by,
i
am
sorry,
authored
by
–
decided
by
the
court.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
they
were
not
corporations.
one
was
the
business
and
one
was
an
individual.
the
significance
of
the
see
case
was
that
a
businessman
with
respect
to
his
private
property
as
just
fundamental
right
as
a
individual
with
respect
to
his
house.
but
there
is
no
distinction
between
a
business
interest
owned
by
an
individual,
true
and
his
own
residence,
neither
involved
a
corporation.
these
two
cases
did
hold
though
that
administrative
search
of
private
property
whether
it,
residence
or
business,
without
proper
consent
is
per
se
unreasonable,
and
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
if
no
search
warrant
has
been
obtained
except
in
certain
special
circumstances
which
the
court
discussed
in
these
two
cases.
we
impliedly
all
the
way
through
here,
the
state
seems
to
be
arguing
these
two
cases
don't
apply
or
shouldn't
apply.
they
offered
a
number
of
grounds
in
that
respect.
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
on
just
what
the
search
inspection
was
here.
we
do
know,
as
justice
marshall
points
out
that
the
inspector
did
go
on
the
premises.
he
didn't
want
for
affiliation,
he
didn't
go
on
for
cup
of
coffee,
he
went
on
there
to
get
evidence
this
time.
he
was
there
at
least
ten
minutes,
may
have
been
more.
the
epa
indicates,
he
should
be
there
30
minutes
to
make
the
proper
ringelmann
examination.
he
did
take
pictures.
the
state
for
reasons
known
to
it
decided
not
to
introduce
those
pictures
in
support
of
the
state's
case.
the
inspector
said
i
believe
that
they
really
don't
show
anything.
i
don't
think
they
do.
i
have
put
them
in
because
i
think
to
demonstrate
the
steam
and
so
forth.
this
did
constitute
a
search,
i
believe
as
record
said
in
cax
(ph)
case
involving
the
telephone
booth,
that
the
fourth
amendment
not
only
stands
through
the
seizure
of
tangible
things
but
also
extends
to
intangibles
such
as,
in
that
case,
a
recording
of
a
conversation.
i
am
sure
a
photograph
would
be
searched.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
well,
it
had
to
somewhere.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
what
was
being
emitted
from
this
equipment
and
plant
of
a
--
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
no.
it
certainly
didn't.
he
was
responsible
for
it,
i
agree
but
it
didn't
belong
to
the
plant.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
no.
the
inspector
took
a
metal
image
of
it,
took
a
picture
of
it.
i
don't
think
a
search
is
any
lesser
search
because
of
a
--
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
well,
it
was
in
the
court
of
appeals,
it
was
not
raised
and
no
proper
record
was
made
before
the
variance
board.
i
would
like
to
be
quite
candid
that
i
found
an
awful
lot
about
search
and
seizure
and
the
whole
course
of
this
argument
than
i
ever
knew
before
i
started
in
this
case
and
there
are
--
it's
unfortunate
that
record
is
not
more
complete
than
it
could
have
been.
the
evidence
itself,
that
we
are
talking
about
--
here
is
the
degree
of
opacity
of
this
particular
emission.
it
would
be
ideal,
a
fact
could
be
preserved
and
brought
into
court,
of
course
it
can't
be.
pictures,
what
i
suppose
could
be,
if
i
show
something
it
happened,
the
pictures
here
didn't
show
anything.
second
best
evidence
is
what
we
had
here,
the
visual
description
of
what
the
inspector
saw.
i
think,
the
government
conceded
in
this
brief,
that
if
particular
measuring
equipment
had
been
installed
the
results
of
that
would
have
been
searched,
it
could
have
been
brought
into
court.
i
don't
think
it's
any
less
of
the
search
because
the
method
of
observation
of
reporting
the
evidence
in
a
sense
approved.
the
inspector
apparently
felt
it
necessary
to
go
on
the
premises
and
i
have
said
that
the
state
now
feels
that's
why
i
defend
his
going
on
the
premises.
at
one
point
in
this
case,
the
argument
was
made
that
the
open
fields
doctrine
prevents
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
here.
well,
perhaps
it
would,
if
we
had
a
factual
background
to
apply
to.
these
observations
were
not
made
from
an
open
filed,
we
do
know
that.
they
were
made
from
the
premises,
we
don't
know
much
about
the
nature
of
the
premises
whether
they
are
open
to
the
public
or
not,
there
is
no
indication.
the
federal
justice
department
refers
to
the
fact
that
there
was
no
fence
around.
questions
asked
was
there
any
sign
of
it.
well
i
submit
that,
to
ensure
your
privacy
it
is
not
necessary
to
put
up
a
fence,
to
ensure
that
you
won’t
be
intruded
upon
with
unnecessary
investigations,
it
should
not
be
necessary
to
put
up
signs
or
hire
dogs
to
keep
people
off.
we
don’t
know,
there
does
not
appear
to
be
a
fence
involved,
we
don’t
know
where
he
was
on
the
premises.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
this
comes
in
to
the
plain
view
doctrine,
i
mean
you
cannot
ignore
what
is
in
plain
view.
i
think
that
is
where
we
have
to
seek
the
answer
to
this.
certainly,
anybody
whether
a
police
officer
or
not,
you
got
a
right
to
walk
up
and
on
out
of
the
grocery
store
and
see
what
is
showing
there.
the
extent
to
which
you
expect
a
person
to
be
there
and
see
what
they
are
seeing,
i
think
is
important.
the
court
addressed
itself
most
recently
to
i
think
what
this
problem
was
in
the
coolidge
case
versus
new
hampshire.
it
was
in
that
case
that
in
discussing
what
may
be
in
plain
view
that
a
couple
of
limitations
were
discussed
by
the
court.
first
of
all,
they
indicated
that
the
officer
involved
should
have
a
prior
justification
for
being
whether
it
was
a
legitimate
reason
to
be
there
unconnected
with
the
search
that
is
being
made.
it
reiterated
again
the
case
did
that
plain
view
doctrine
did
not
--
it
was
still
true
that
no
intrusion
is
justified
without
a
careful
determination
of
necessity
and
that
the
discovery
of
the
evidence
involved
must
be
an
inadvertency
that
where
you
go
on
to
a
person’s
property
looking
for
something
as
the
inspector
did
here
knowing
that
he
was
going
to
make
a
search,
it
can
be
hardly
said
that
what
he
found
was
--
he
justified
because
it
was
in
plain
view.
i
think
in
this
case
or
one
another
one
similar
to
it
the
court
indicated
that
if
you
poke
around
long
enough
you
can
always
find
something
in
plain
view.
that
is
about
as
closest
i
can
get
to
what
that
problem
is
and
the
answers
i
found
by
this
court.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
yes,
some
time
ago
and
still
standing
as
good
law
in
this
court
as
far
as
i
can
determine
but
we
don’t
seem
to
be
having
an
open
field
here
from
what
the
observation
were
made,
the
case
would
be
very
simple
if
we
did.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
yeah.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
yeah
there
were
lot
of
stales
discovered
in
those
days.
it
may
or
may
not
have
been
in
plain
view
and
i
think
a
lot
of
law
was
made
on
that
account.
i
don’t
think
the
present
status
for
our
law
would
allow
revenue
agent
to
go
pocking
around
in
my
backyard
or
somebody
else’s
field
to
see
if
he
can
find
it
still
tucked
away
behind
the
lilac
bush.
i
do
not
believe
our
law
presently
permits
that
in
recent
decisions
of
this
court.
perhaps
it
may
have
been
different
in
the
twenties.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
where
there
is
smoke
there
is
stale.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
i
understand
that
the
inspector
came
on
lawfully
with
the
warrant
or
otherwise
looking
for
something
else
and
found
a
stale.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
i
think
in
a
technical
sense,
these
things
can
always
be
pushed
to
a
line
where
they
seem
ridiculous.
i
think
these
cases
have
said
that
any
invasion
of
property,
any
intrusion
without
judiciary
view
in
advance
accept
in
certain
circumstances
which
we
can
get
to
is
prohibited
by
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
camara
and
see
have
said
that,
most
of
the
time
has
been
spent
in
what
these
exceptions
are.
the
case
of
cax
(ph)
approached
this
problem
that
we
both
have
been
discussing
now.
a
minimal
invasion
and
in
that
case
the
court
allowed
that
here
they
were
over
hanging
a
conversion
in
the
phone
booth,
but
this
was
about
as
minimal
invasion
of
privacy
as
you
can
have,
but
still
this
was
forbidden
under
restriction
of
the
fourth
amendment
because
there
had
not
been
a
prior
judiciary
view
of
the
invasion
of
privacy
which
occurred
in
making
that
search.
now
these
fine
lines
are
always
difficult
but
i
would
have
to
say
that
perhaps
approaches
what
we
are
talking
about.
we
were
on
the
coolidge
case
and
the
plain
view
doctrine
and
a
number
of
other
statements
made
by
the
court
in
that
case
in
connection
with
the
right
of
privacy
and
so
forth.
i
would
like
to
return
a
minute
to
the
camara
and
see
cases
what
were
important
in
the
particular
context
of
saying
that
these
restrictions
imposed
by
the
fourth
amendment
to
secure
privacy
and
guard
against
intrusions
apply
with
equal
force
to
administrative
inspectors
as
they
do
to
police
officers,
that
and
pointing
out
in
that
case
that
the
additional
body
of
law
that
has
developed
out
side
of
earlier
traditions
which
is
involved
with
these
administrative
type
of
compliance
inspections
and
so
forth.
certainly
in
this
day
and
age
that
we
are
in
now
we
are
coming
into
more
and
more
environmental
matters
particularly.
and
i
think
the
court
was
concerned
in
these
cases
in
1967
that
the
people
enforcing
these
laws
were
not
going
to
be
as
concerned
with
or
they
weren't
aware
that
they
should
be
as
concerned
with
rights
of
privacy
and
security
as
in
the
conventional
law
enforcement
lay.
that
is
import
of
these
cases
is
same
to
fire
inspector,
building
inspectors
and
so
forth.
you
have
to
just
as
concerned
about
rights
of
individuals
as
people
involved
in
more
direct
criminal
activities.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
alright.
i
would
like
to
do
something
about
this.
colonnade
is
a
little
like
the
situation
we
have
here
where
the
inspectors
were
denied
access
to
a
liquor
stock,
i
believe
it
was
and
forced
their
way
in
and
ceased
the
liquor
stock
which
indeed
was
improperly
labeled
bottles.
justice
douglas
offered
the
opinion
in
that
case
suppressed
that
evidence.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
i
don’t
know
i
think
the
court
--
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
biswell.
involved
as
court
is
aware,
a
situation
of
a
business
man
who
desired
to
go
in
to
a
business
involving
sale
and
distribution
of
guns
requiring
him
to
obtain
a
license
knowing
that
it
was
a
pervasively
regulated
business.
i
think
was
the
language
of
the
court
and
that
he
would
indeed
be
subject
to
investigations
and
investigations
made
without
a
warrant.
now,
i
think
biswell
is
a
quick
a
bit
different
situation
than
we
have
here.
i
am
surprised
that
it
hasn't
come
up
earlier
in
our
discussion,
but,
of
course
there
is
no
federal
license
involved.
there
is
no
license
at
all
involved
in
operating
in
alfalfa
dehydrating
plant.
anybody
can
start
and
it's
a
necessary
adjunct
to
the
agricultural
economy
of
the
area.
instead
of
baling
it
and
selling
it
they
dry
it,
palletize
it
and
sack
it
and
sell
it.
no
license
is
necessary,
there
are
no
regulations
applicable
to
the
business
other
than
regulations
that
all
of
us
are
subject
to
in
terms
of
fire
code,
building
code,
zoning
and
so
forth.
air
pollution
which
we
are
all
subject
to.
there
are
no
regulations
unique
to
the
business
as
in
the
gun
control
act
and
in
biswell
case.
i
don’t
think
there
is
anything
can
be
drawn
from
that
saying
that
the
exception
made
from
camara
and
see
by
biswell
should
be
extended
to
this
situation.
i
see
no
rationale
for
it.
colonnade,
to
return
to
that
for
just
for
a
minute.
there
the
evidence
was
gathered,
was
suppressed
because
there
was
no
statutory
scheme
set
forth
for
warrant
less
inspections.
i
think
as
i
look
at
the
statute
involved
in
that
case,
i
find
it
identical
to
statute
to
colorado
in
this
case,
entry
is
authorized
but
no
scheme
involved,
no
requirement
for
identification,
no
limitation
on
time,
no
limitation
on
scope.
the
court
in
that
situation
said
there
may
be
a
statuary
scheme
authorizing
entry
without
warrant
but
as
long
as
no
particulars
are
spelled
out,
no
limitations
are
spelled
out
the
requirements
of
fourth
amendment
still
apply.
well
the
same
could
be
said
in
this
situation.
now,
throughout
the
course
of
briefing
and
argument
in
this
case
there
have
been
a
number
of
remarks
about
the
burden
of
obtaining
a
search
warrant.
in
the
first
place,
i
think
we
should
realize
that
the
warrant
is
going
to
be
an
isolated
situation,
i
think
mr.
tucker
indicated
most
people.
no
percentage
was
given
but
most
people
in
the
situation
or
person
identified
themselves
is
according
to
the
law
of
the
inspection.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
you
are
going
to
walk
in
where
you
want
on
this
person’s
premises
as
this
inspector
did.
he
had
to
go
from
one
location
to
another
to
get
the
sun
and
the
wind
and
so
forth
in
the
right
place.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
i
believe
it
was
justice
marshall.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
as
to
the
nature
of
the
premises
that
is
all
it
was,
whether
it
was
a
parking
lot
or
whether
it
was
open
to
the
public
or
otherwise
that
is
all
it
said,
the
record
did
say
that
he
moved
from
one
location
to
another
on
the
premises.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
what
was
going
into
them?
yes,
i
was
talking
about
search
warrant,
would
this
have
hindered,
would
this
requirement
hinder
making
these
type
of
inspections,
most
of
the
time
now
people
will
--
if
the
consent
is
withheld
you
go
on
–
the
inspector
goes
on
and
identifies
himself,
consent
is
withheld,
then
the
inspector
has
got
to
decide.
well
can
i
do
it
from
the
open
field?
go
over
and
stand
over
there
and
get
my
job
done
or
is
it
necessary,
i
be
here
on
the
premises
and
i
think
camara
and
see
require
that
if
he
must
be
on
the
premises,
if
he
is
going
to
intrude
for
the
purpose
of
gathering
the
evidence,
go
get
a
warrant.
there
has
been
some
talk
that
the
timeliness
is
needed
and
so
forth.
in
colorado
rule
41,
a
warrant
--
there
is
no
limitation
on
how
good
long,
you
can
get
a
warrant
for.
for
a
reasonable
time,
because
we
can
one
–
lasts
for
two
weeks.
anytime
you
go
by,
you
are
ready
to
go
there
with
a
warrant
and
if
you
have
any
reason
to
be
--
if
you
think
you
are
going
to
refused
get
your
warrant
before
you
go.
there
is
indication
for
example,
on
this
case,
inspector
setting
on
this
june
4th
morning,
june
6th
to
visit
these
three
plants
and
issue
citations;
he
could
have
taken
a
warrant
along
with
him,
the
result
of
the
case
would
have
been
exactly
the
same.
the
evidence
would
have
been
the
same.
i
don’t
think
that
he
said
that
the
lack
of
his
having
to
get
a
warrant
would
have
impeded
his
activity.
we
have
talked
about
system
indeed
all
the
way
through
this
that
the
accused
should
have
notice
of
the
inspector
being
there.
now,
aside
from
this
affording
the
right
to
object
to
an
inspection
being
made,
evidence
being
gathered,
i
think
it
should
be
noticed
that
this
is
not
an
uncommon
statutory
scheme
as
referred
to
in
the
government's
brief,
generously
provided
with
more
example
than
i
could
have
thought
of,
where
the
credentials
must
be
shown
before
you
can
go
on.
indeed,
the
federal
clean
air
act
for
just
these
types
of
inspections;
federal
water
pollution
act
and
mine
safety
act;
all
require
that
before
you
make
an
inspection,
you
show
your
credentials.
this
is
not
uncommon.
the
colorado
law
as
it
now
reads,
you
must
get
consent
or
a
warrant.
well,
obviously
you
can
get
consent
even
you
don’t
even
ask.
the
person
doesn’t
know
you
are
there.
so,
in
effect
it
requires
you
to
come
up
and
give
notice
that
you
are
there.
a
curious
example,
speaking
of
the
colorado
law
is
that
if
you
are
going
to
take
a
tangible
sample
of
whatever
you
have
looked
at
in
air
pollution,
you
are
required
to
give
it
to
the
person
you
took
it
from.
this
is
strange
that
the
colorado
law
says
that
if
you
are
going
to
take
a
visual
impression
of
whatever
you
are
charging
the
evidence
of,
there
is
no
requirement
that
person
from
whom
or
on
whose
property
you
take
this
visual
impression,
hasn’t
got
a
right
to
be
there
simultaneously
and
look
at
the
same
thing.
look,
this
is
what
i
want
to
charge
you
with.
that's
all
we
have
asked
in
this
case.
so,
you
would
have
a
chance
to
look
yourself
and
see
what
is
there,
have
some
way
of
answering.
we
did
complain
somewhat
bitterly
and
maybe
at
too
much
length
and
our
people
going
to
the
smoke
school
run
by
the
state
of
colorado;
we
are
not
certified
that
they
were
competent,
that
they
have
taken
the
smoke
schools
so
that
they
could
testify
with
the
same
degree
of
credibility,
the
state
inspectors
did,
but
perhaps
the
point
is
we
had
no
opportunity
to
look
at
that
dissipating,
evanescent,
here
and
now
and
gone
for
ever
evidence
that
violation
is
based
on.
we
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
in
our
brief
talking
about
the
constitutional
adequacy
of
the
ringelmann
test;
i
don’t
propose
to
go
into
that
in
greater
detail.
then
the
court
by
its
questions
as
indicated
is
concerned
with
sufficiency
of
that
as
a
test.
we
did
direct
the
court's
attentions
and
perhaps
we
have
already
--
the
situation
in
the
pennsylvania
power
case,
i
only
have
the
report
in
the
environmental
law
reporter
and
state
implementation
plan
was
turned
down
by
the
federal
court
appeals.
because
the
instrument
of
enforcement
was
the
ringelmann
test.
and
i
am
sure
that
case
was
going
to
end
up
here
before
it
is
finished
because
as
justice
department
of
attorney
indicated
this
is
a
very
common
provision
in
these
implementations
plans.
there
is
a
crude
test
granted
as
quick,
speedy,
hit
it
and
go
sort
of
thing,
but
it
is
not
a
very
good
indication
of
how
much
actual
emissions,
pollutants
if
you
please
are
involved.
i
can’t
help
but
think
is
important
that
the
colorado
law
has
changed
since
this
all
came
up
and
as
mr.
tucker
has
indicated
they
can’t
do
what
they
are
trying
to
justify
and
urge
this
court,
they
should
be
able
to
do
even
now
under
colorado
law.
it
makes
this
me
wonder
why
we
are
here.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
state
petition
for
certiorari,
i
am
here
because
i
was
called
here.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
i
think
the
effect
of
a
reversal
by
this
court
of
what
the
colorado
court
has
done
would
be
a
very
open
invitation
to
all
people
engaged
in
this
area
of
law
enforcement
that
you
can
go
on
when
you
want
to
without
telling
anybody
and
make
your
investigations
in
secret
and
advise
them
later.
how
much
later
is
up
to
you,
of
what
you
have
found
and
leave
them
to
their
own
devices
as
to
how
to
defend.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
i
think
justivce
white
the
appeals
court
grounded
its
decision
on
two
things,
on
due
process,
fundamental
requirements
of
procedural
due
process;
that
would
be
a
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
it
did,
it
grounded
almost
the
same
language
as
the
court
of
appeals.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
did
was.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
those
fundamental
elements
of
due
process,
i
think
that's
bogged
the
way
i
referred
to
it.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
yes,
i
think
it
is
and
this
indeed
we
do
and
of
course,
court
of
appeals
carried
it
one
step
forward.
i
think
as
i
found
in
going
into
this
case
further
and
further,
this
notice
argument
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
does
tend
to
lead
you
right
into
the
search
problem
under
the
fourth
amendment,
identifying
yourself,
letting
it
be
known
what
is
going
on,
giving
a
chance
to
either
object
or
nothing
else
to
be
able
to
defend.
my
time
is
well
up.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
thank
you
justice
douglas.
i
think
to
answer
your
question
that
you
asked
earlier
mr.
justice
white,
the
fact
that
there
was
a
trespass,
doesn't
make
any
difference,
says
this
court
articulate
in
the
katz
case
and
the
court
said,
assuming
that
the
officers
were
both
trespassers
and
lacking
in
probable
cause,
fourth
amendments
protections
do
not
extend
to
the
open
field
area
surrounding
a
dwelling
and
the
immediate
adjacent
curtilage
and
therefore
information
gained
as
a
result
of
a
civil
trespass
on
open
field
is
not
constitutionally
obtained.
the
pictures
and
the
testimony
of
inspector
tailor
show
that
he
observed
this
plume
of
smoke
before
he
was
actually
on
the
premises
of
western
alfalfa.
he
had
justifiable
cause
to
enter
on
to
the
premises
and
obtain
the
evidence
which
he
did
and
that
was
an
opacity
reading
of
the
smoke
plume
or
the
plume
which
they
were
putting
in
to
the
atmosphere.
counsel
has
stated
in
his
argument
that
the
evidence
would
be
the
same
if
a
warrant
had
been
obtained
and
that
is
exactly
correct
and
therefore
a
warrant
would
serve
no
useful
purpose.
if
the
state
had
had
a
warrant
or
had
obtained
consent,
the
evidence
would
be
exactly
the
same
because
western
alfalfa
or
none
of
these
operations
have
a
trained
smoke
carrier
on
the
premises.
they
would
not
have
been
able
to
take
opacity
readings
of
their
own
on
that
particular
day
and
in
fact
after
they
received
the
cease-and-desist
order,
some
twelve
days
later,
they
still
didn’t
take
any
opacity
readings.
so
consent
or
a
warrant
would
not
change
the
fact
situation
at
all
and
would
not
change
the
evidence.
so,
it
is
a
useless
gesture
to
require
the
state
to
go
through
the
process
of
obtaining
a
warrant.
the
inspector
here
was
merely
observing
what
was
being
put
into
atmosphere
for
anyone
who
desired
to
look,
to
see.
the
due
process
question
is
no
different
than
an
individual
who
is
speedy.
now
counsel
has
used
this
as
an
example,
you
are
not
warned
by
an
officer
prior
to
your
speeding
that
he
is
going
to
observe
you
and
if
you
speed,
you
are
going
to
get
a
ticket.
he
stops
you
after
the
fact.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
that
is
correct,
but
what
western
is
complaining
about
here
is
they
are
saying,
we
did
not
have
notice
at
the
time
so
that
we
could
have
an
independent
observer
present.
you
are
not
or
you
do
not
have
any
right
to
have
an
independent
observer
present
on
the
highway
so
that
you
have
an
independent
third
party
to
testify
against
the
officer
saying,
you
were
not
speeding.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
no,
but
that's
not
the
fault
of
the
public.
both
of
the
laws
are
to
protect
the
public
interest
of
welfare
and
safety.
that
is
you
must
operate
your
car
on
the
highways
in
a
manner
that
you
do
not
endanger
the
safety
of
the
other
people
using
the
highway.
western
alfalfa
cannot
use
the
atmosphere
in
a
manner
that
it
endangers
the
health
and
safety
of
the
rest
of
the
public.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
they
require
a
plant
to
submit
a
plan
for
whereby
they
are
going
to
bring
their
operation
under
compliance
and
they
have
a
choice
of
numerous
equipment
that
can
be
installed
on
the
plant
to
either
catch
the
particulate
matter
before
it
escapes
into
the
atmosphere
or
some
manner
to
prevent
it
from
going
in
to
that.
mr.
donald
d.
cawelti
that's
correct
well,
sulphur
of
course
would
be
a
more
toxic
material
and
they
would
not
be
allowed
to
allow
that
to
escape
into
the
atmosphere.
thank
you.
