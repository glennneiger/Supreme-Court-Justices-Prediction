mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
colorado
court
of
appeals,
division
two.
that
court
held
that
the
cease
and
desist
order
entered
by
the
air
pollution
variance
board
in
the
state
of
colorado
against
western
alfaalfa
was
unconstitutional
because
based
on
observations
of
three
plants
of
western
alfaalfa,
made
an
violation
of
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
court
held
that
these
observations
have
been
made
in
an
unconstitutional
manner
because
first,
the
inspector
making
the
observations
had
entered
on
to
the
premises
of
the
respondent
without
obtaining
consent
or
a
warrant,
and
second;
because
the
observations
were
made
without
prior
notifications
to
western
alfaalfa.
the
observations
made
by
the
inspector
on
june
4th
1969
show
that
the
opacity
of
the
dry
emissions
from
two
of
the
plants
was
90%
and
one
of
the
plants
was
85%.
these
emissions
were
very
substantially
in
excess
with
a
40%
opacity
permitted
by
the
colorado
statutes
then
in
effect.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
i
think,
first
of
all
the
inspectors
who
have
been
trained
have
not
used
the
chart.
they
simply
observed
the
smoke.
second,
the
ringelmann
standard
itself
was
developed
for
use
of
carbon
smoke
and
it
is
a
black
white
standard.
the
standard
here
which
was
also
incorporated
in
the
statutes,
the
opacity
standard
rated
on
percentage
of
opacity
essentially
the
percentage
of
light
which
is
transmitted
through
the
emission
plume.
it
is
not
correctly
a
ringelmann
test
here
and
the
inspector
simply
tried
to
observe
the
plume
and
determine
the
extent
to
which
light
is
able
to
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
is
right,
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
mr.
justice
marshall
you
are
turning
to
the
search
and
seizure
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
since
it
is
a
judgmental
process,
in
order
to
make
a
accurate
and
reliable
observations,
there
are
certain
standard
procedures
which
were
followed.
first
of
all
it
is
important
for
the
observer
to
be
in
certain
position
in
relation
for
the
plume
and
second
it
is
considered
appropriate
for
him
to
make
a
number
of
observations
over
a
period
of
time
in
order
to
increase
the
reliability
of
this
observation.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
no
the
sun
is
to
be
behind
him.
i
do
not
know
what
the
colorado
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
apparently
the
literature
shows
that
you
are
able
to
judge
this
quality
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
the
reflected
light
coming
back,
i
am
not
fully
able
to
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
alright
i
have
seen
nothing
in
the
material
in
this
case
to
indicate
that
brilliance
is
the
problem,
background
is
the
problem.
if
you
have
a
background
of
the
same
colors
as
the
emission
you
have,
you
have
a
difficulty
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
well
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
as
your
questions
and
those
of
your
brother
to
the
state
of
colorado
indicate
the
nature
of
the
place
from
which
these
observations
were
made
is
rather
critical
to
any
development
of
fourth
amendment
issue
here.
fourth
amendment
issue
in
this
case
was
developed
in
the
most
awkward
procedural
posture.
it
was
not
raised
and
argued
before
the
board.
it
was
not
argued
before
the
district
court.
it
was
not
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals.
as
we
learned
this
morning,
the
court
of
appeals
simply,
suddenly
decided
that
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
problem.
the
only
thing
in
the
record
that
provides
any
answer
to
where
the
inspector
went,
is
his
answer
on
direct
examination
in
the
record,
page
25
that
he
went,
“on
the
premises”.
the
more
detailed
answers
which
have
been
provided
to
you
here
in
oral
argument
today
reflect
the
information
not
to
be
found
in
the
record.
now,
it's
our
position
in
this
case.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
there
are
pictures
in
the
record
but
there
is
no
testimony
tying
those
pictures
to
the
–
where
he
made
the
observation.
the
fact
that
the
pictures
don't
show
and
no
trespassing
sign
doesn't
tell
you
whether
there
is
no
trace
passing
sign
somewhere
else
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
sir,
we
do
not
want
any
issue
decided.
it's
our
view
that
the
burden
in
this
case
of
asserting
fourth
amendment
claim
and
developing
a
record,
lay
on
western
alfalfa
which
claims
now
to
have
been
the
object
of
any
legal
fourth
amendment
search.
all
they
have
developed
was
--
in
fact,
the
state
developed
for
them
was
that
the
inspector
was
on
the
premises.
that's
fully
consistent
with
the
view
that
the
inspector
was
on
an
area
of
the
premises
fully
accessible
to
the
public
and
absent
of
better
developed
record,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
factual
case
.
(voice
overlap)
the
colorado
court
of
appeals,
it
seems
to
me,
it's
not
discussed
the
question
of
whether
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
i
don't.
it
is
possible
to
take
a
view
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
any
time
you
cross
the
property
line
and
you
are
a
state
official,
you
have
entered
private
property
and
so
it's
fourth
amendment
problem
and
i
think
that
view
which
is
an
erroneous
view
was
the
view
of
the
colorado
court
of
appeals.
now
at
quite
elementary
ground,
we
urge
that
the
decision
be
reversed.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
no
their
reliance
upon
camera,
it
seems
to
me
indicates
they
thought
there
was
a
separate
fourth
amendment
problem
here.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that's
right.
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
they
kind
of
felt
they
were
bound
by
the
precedents
of
this
court.
i
think
that
the
fact
that
they
decided
the
case,
on
this
issue
without
argument
on
the
point,
that
they
went
straight.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that's
right,
as
far
as
the
record
shows
the
entry
was
on
to
area
open
to
the
public
and
our
contention
is
that
inspectors
for
the
state
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes,
there
is
that
testimony
in
there
the
pictures,
which
i
have
not
seen
and
which
are
not
connected
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
i
assume
so
but
you
cannot
relate
the
place
where
the
pictures
were
to
taken
to
where
the
observations
were
made.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
apparently,
there
are
sequences
here,
at
some
distances
from
the
plant,
he
stops
and
took
a
shot,
as
he
got
closer,
he
took
another
shot
and
then
he
took
another
shot.
then
he
took
his
observations
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
he
then
went
down
and
chatted
with
the
plant
management
at
least
two
of
the
locations
about
what
they
were
doing
to
come
into
compliance
with
statute
and
went
home.
there
are
issues,
potential
constitutional
issues
about
the
power
of
inspectors
of
this
type
to
enter
various
parts
and
aspects
of
industrial
premises
to
cross
fences
to
disregard
no
trespassing
signs,
and
there
maybe
issues
this
court
will
have
to
face
someday.
they
are
simply
not
presented
by
this
case
and
it
was
purely
interesting
hypothetical
questions
on
this
record.
since
the
right
being
asserted
is
western
alfalfa
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
well
if
it's
affirmed
then
the
only
possible
construction
is
that
whenever
an
inspector
enters
private
property
to
know
there
is
general
holding
out
to
the
public
to
enter,
that
we
have
fourth
amendment
problems
and
fourth
amendment
procedures
must
be
adhered
to
and
it
will
just
complicate
the
process
of
making
these
kinds
of
observations
and
other
observations
related
to
the
enforcement
of
regulatory
statutes.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes,
if
there
is
fourth
amendment
rights
and
that
has
to
be
noticed
to
either
get
consent
or
serve
the
warrant
and
they
are
just
closely
related.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
but
we
just
find
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
we
find
this
due
process
contention
quite
extraordinary.
law
enforcement
officials
daily
observe
without
notice
to
legal
acts
which
were
pleading
and
unreproducible
and
their
observations
are
nevertheless
considered
to
be
admissible
evidence.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
i
think
of
many
common
examples
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
this
is
matter
--
this
require
testimony
by
trained
observer.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
well,
as
an
example
it
occurs
to
me
as
to
his
speeding
where
observations
are
made
of
a
speeding
car
whether
they
would
be
based
on
time
or
they
used
a
radar,
require
a
certain
training
and
competence.
the
police
come
out
and
flag
the
car
down,
that
stops
the
movement,
where
is
the
driver
left?
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
well,
that
goes
to
the
question
as
to
whether
this
is
a
reliable
kind
of
observation
and
which
is
prohibitive
enough
to
be
admissible
in
to
evidence.
that's
a
separate
point.
it's
a
due
process
attack
upon
the
use
of
the
test.
on
that,
as
far
as
united
states
is
concerned,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
inclusion
of
these
types
of
emission
standards
and
state
implementation
plans
under
the
federal
air
pollution
control
act
has
been
required
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
because
they
in
the
judgment
of
that
agency
offer
the
only
feasible
type
of
standard
and
means
of
testing
which
can
be
feasibly
enforced
against
broad
range
of
emission
sources
on
continuing
basis
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
the
use
–
the
states
must
submit
the
implementation
plan
which
meets
the
federal
standards
which
are
set
about
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
under
the
federal
act.
one
of
the
things
that
state
implementation
plan
must
have
is
visible
emission
standards
and
that
means
opacity
and
ringelmann
type
standards.
it's
the
only
type
known
in
the
field,
the
reference
code
of
federal
regulations
sections
51.19
sub
c.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
no
there
are
visible
emission
standards
which
are
essentially
you
see
what
it
looks
like
and
there
are
certain
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that's
one
type
of
standards
and
other
type
of
standards
are
those
which
relate
to
the
actual
quantity
of
various
kinds
of
material
in
the
emission
which
require
a
very
expensive
and
complex
testing
of
the
emission
flow
during
the
actual
operation.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
no
it
can
be
--
once
you
set
up
operating
it
doesn't
take
a
long
period.
you
have
to
set
up
the
equipment
and
all
--
often
testing
equipment
is
brought
in
for
this
purposes
and
removed
because
of
its
expanse,
it's
delicate
nature
and
so
on.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
is
actual
testing
of
what
is
there.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
particulates,
that
is
correct.
now,
that
type
of
testing
cannot
be
simply
done
without
the
cooperation
and
advance
notice.
the
plant
is
expensive
and
it
is
the
judgment
of
federal
agency
that
if
they
have
to
rely
on
that
contesting
alone,
there
can
no
feasible
air
pollution
control
program
which
is
applicable
to
all
emission
of
all
types.
it
has
been
shown
the
case
--
let
me
say
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
district
of
columbia,
partland,
which
has
been
remanded
and
which
the
agency
is
working
on,
involves
an
opacity
standard
of
10%
which
is
very
close
to
clear.
and
the
question
that
the
court
raised
is
with
that
lower
standard,
you
could
make
reliable
observation
such
as
to
make
it
a
workable,
a
feasible
standard.
standard
here
40%
which
was
kind
of
half
dark
smoke.
the
observations
here
were
90%
which
means
that
they
were
practically,
completely
obscured
the
view.
the
factual
question
at
10%
is
quite
different
from
the
factual
question
presented
on
this
record.
my
time
is
running.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
well
the
general
problem
of
passage
of
time
as
it
affects
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
defend
himself
is
one
that
has
come
before
this
court
in
a
number
of
different
contexts.
the
general
approach
has
been
there
must
be
some
showing
of
prejudice.
now,
if
for
instance,
they
didn’t
get
notice
for
six
months
and
there
is
no
showing
of
any
reason
why
they
shouldn’t
have
noticed
it
more
promptly
and
they
show
that
in
that
period
they
had
quite
innocently
made
significant
changes
in
the
plant.
so,
that
they
weren’t
in
the
position
to
make
any
effort
to
reproduce
its
operation
and
demonstrate
that
it
in
fact
operated
within
the
standard.
that
for
instance
seems
to
be
prejudice
or
if
they
got
noticed
in
six
months
and
they
had
to
have
the
hearing
in
thirty
days
thereafter
and
they
said,
well
the
crop
season
is
over
we
would
like
to
run
the
plant
and
we
will
get
experts
out
and
we
will
show
that
it
is
running
like
it
runs,
it
is
clean.
the
state
said,
well,
you
have
to
have
the
hearing
now,
we
are
sorry
it
is
winter;
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
prejudice.
but,
what
is
notably
absent
from
this
record
is
any
effort
by
the
company
to
conduct,
by
its
own
experts
a
ringelmann
opacity
observation
and
introduced
it
in
to
evidence.
indeed
on
page
73
of
the
record,
you
find
that
counsel
for
the
western
alfalfa
states.
he
says,
judging
from
the
testimony
i
hear
at
the
first
hearing,
unless
there
is
some
change
in
the
method
of
operation
of
these
dehydration
plants,
i
will
expect
the
staff
to
come
out
and
we
are
finding
ringelmann
violations.
his
view
seemed
to
be
that
--
if
we
go
through
this
again
--
the
staff
will
come
out
and
they
will
look
at
the
plants
and
they
say
that
this
is
more
than
40
%
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
they
offered
the
observation,
a
written
letter
to
them
from
their
hired
consultant,
one
mr.
roning,
who
was
not
qualified.
the
letter
didn’t
–
it
was
not
called
to
testify,
not
subject
to
cross
examination.
he
did
not
--
his
letter
didn’t
indicate
the
conditions
under
which
the
plants
were
operating.
it
was
just
totally
deficient
as
an
evidentiary
offer
and
was
made
--
in
fact
the
observations
were
taking
some
period
of
time
--.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
well,
both
offers
are
defective
for
reasons
shown
in
the
record.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
it
was
simply
they
submitted
the
letter.
there
were
no
applicable
rules
of
evidence.
they
want
to
put
something
in,
they
put
it
in.
but
you
look
at
the
letter
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
i
think
they
could
have
made
it
by
showing
that
by
evidence
that
under
those
operating
conditions
have
been
in
effect
on
june
6th,
these
plants
don’t
emit
emission
--
this
level
of
opacity.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
oh,
we
certainly
would.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
well,
we
have
reports,
environmental
protection
agency,
from
inspectors
that
when
they
do
come
on
some
plants,
when
they
give
notice,
it
certainly
turns
out,
the
plant
finishes
its
run
and
seems
they
are
going
home
for
the
day
and
the
inspector
can
wait,
may
be
he
can
sit
around
and
well,
the
next
day
or
he
has
many
other
inspections
to
make
and
he
leaves
and
when
he
leaves
we
get
words,
the
plant
is
running
again.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
is
correct
and
we
do
present
credentials,
but
we
would
like
to
leave
the
option
for
statutory
flexibility.
if
the
experience
on
these
acts
shows
if
there
are
problems
of
particular
types.
also
i
think
there
is
an
open
question
on
the
federal
statue
as
to
whether
these
kinds
of
opacity
--
presumably
on
the
federal
statues,
these
kinds
of
opacity
observations
can
be
made
under
the
fourth
amendment
from
property
open
to
the
public
and
which
no
special
governmental
right
of
entry
has
to
be
ascertained
and
the
due
process
theory
would
require
the
opacity
observation
made
from
the
public
highway
not
be
made,
unless
notice
is
given
in
advance.
in
some
of
these
plants,
they
can
turn
on
the
scrubbers,
turn
off
the
scrubbers,
the
precipitators
and
so
on
and
it
saves
the
money
not
to
have
them
on.
and
hired
inspectors
can’t
be
everywhere
all
the
time.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes,
so
it
is
always
a
question
of
degree,
we
are
not
doing
it.
that
is
right.
thank
you.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
colorado
court
of
appeals,
division
two.
that
court
held
that
the
cease
and
desist
order
entered
by
the
air
pollution
variance
board
in
the
state
of
colorado
against
western
alfaalfa
was
unconstitutional
because
based
on
observations
of
three
plants
of
western
alfaalfa,
made
an
violation
of
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
court
held
that
these
observations
have
been
made
in
an
unconstitutional
manner
because
first,
the
inspector
making
the
observations
had
entered
on
to
the
premises
of
the
respondent
without
obtaining
consent
or
a
warrant,
and
second;
because
the
observations
were
made
without
prior
notifications
to
western
alfaalfa.
the
observations
made
by
the
inspector
on
june
4th
1969
show
that
the
opacity
of
the
dry
emissions
from
two
of
the
plants
was
90%
and
one
of
the
plants
was
85%.
these
emissions
were
very
substantially
in
excess
with
a
40%
opacity
permitted
by
the
colorado
statutes
then
in
effect.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
i
think,
first
of
all
the
inspectors
who
have
been
trained
have
not
used
the
chart.
they
simply
observed
the
smoke.
second,
the
ringelmann
standard
itself
was
developed
for
use
of
carbon
smoke
and
it
is
a
black
white
standard.
the
standard
here
which
was
also
incorporated
in
the
statutes,
the
opacity
standard
rated
on
percentage
of
opacity
essentially
the
percentage
of
light
which
is
transmitted
through
the
emission
plume.
it
is
not
correctly
a
ringelmann
test
here
and
the
inspector
simply
tried
to
observe
the
plume
and
determine
the
extent
to
which
light
is
able
to
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
is
right,
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
mr.
justice
marshall
you
are
turning
to
the
search
and
seizure
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
since
it
is
a
judgmental
process,
in
order
to
make
a
accurate
and
reliable
observations,
there
are
certain
standard
procedures
which
were
followed.
first
of
all
it
is
important
for
the
observer
to
be
in
certain
position
in
relation
for
the
plume
and
second
it
is
considered
appropriate
for
him
to
make
a
number
of
observations
over
a
period
of
time
in
order
to
increase
the
reliability
of
this
observation.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
no
the
sun
is
to
be
behind
him.
i
do
not
know
what
the
colorado
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
apparently
the
literature
shows
that
you
are
able
to
judge
this
quality
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
the
reflected
light
coming
back,
i
am
not
fully
able
to
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
alright
i
have
seen
nothing
in
the
material
in
this
case
to
indicate
that
brilliance
is
the
problem,
background
is
the
problem.
if
you
have
a
background
of
the
same
colors
as
the
emission
you
have,
you
have
a
difficulty
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
well
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
as
your
questions
and
those
of
your
brother
to
the
state
of
colorado
indicate
the
nature
of
the
place
from
which
these
observations
were
made
is
rather
critical
to
any
development
of
fourth
amendment
issue
here.
fourth
amendment
issue
in
this
case
was
developed
in
the
most
awkward
procedural
posture.
it
was
not
raised
and
argued
before
the
board.
it
was
not
argued
before
the
district
court.
it
was
not
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals.
as
we
learned
this
morning,
the
court
of
appeals
simply,
suddenly
decided
that
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
problem.
the
only
thing
in
the
record
that
provides
any
answer
to
where
the
inspector
went,
is
his
answer
on
direct
examination
in
the
record,
page
25
that
he
went,
“on
the
premises”.
the
more
detailed
answers
which
have
been
provided
to
you
here
in
oral
argument
today
reflect
the
information
not
to
be
found
in
the
record.
now,
it's
our
position
in
this
case.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
there
are
pictures
in
the
record
but
there
is
no
testimony
tying
those
pictures
to
the
–
where
he
made
the
observation.
the
fact
that
the
pictures
don't
show
and
no
trespassing
sign
doesn't
tell
you
whether
there
is
no
trace
passing
sign
somewhere
else
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
sir,
we
do
not
want
any
issue
decided.
it's
our
view
that
the
burden
in
this
case
of
asserting
fourth
amendment
claim
and
developing
a
record,
lay
on
western
alfalfa
which
claims
now
to
have
been
the
object
of
any
legal
fourth
amendment
search.
all
they
have
developed
was
--
in
fact,
the
state
developed
for
them
was
that
the
inspector
was
on
the
premises.
that's
fully
consistent
with
the
view
that
the
inspector
was
on
an
area
of
the
premises
fully
accessible
to
the
public
and
absent
of
better
developed
record,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
the
factual
case
.
(voice
overlap)
the
colorado
court
of
appeals,
it
seems
to
me,
it's
not
discussed
the
question
of
whether
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
i
don't.
it
is
possible
to
take
a
view
of
the
fourth
amendment
that
any
time
you
cross
the
property
line
and
you
are
a
state
official,
you
have
entered
private
property
and
so
it's
fourth
amendment
problem
and
i
think
that
view
which
is
an
erroneous
view
was
the
view
of
the
colorado
court
of
appeals.
now
at
quite
elementary
ground,
we
urge
that
the
decision
be
reversed.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
no
their
reliance
upon
camera,
it
seems
to
me
indicates
they
thought
there
was
a
separate
fourth
amendment
problem
here.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that's
right.
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
they
kind
of
felt
they
were
bound
by
the
precedents
of
this
court.
i
think
that
the
fact
that
they
decided
the
case,
on
this
issue
without
argument
on
the
point,
that
they
went
straight.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that's
right,
as
far
as
the
record
shows
the
entry
was
on
to
area
open
to
the
public
and
our
contention
is
that
inspectors
for
the
state
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes,
there
is
that
testimony
in
there
the
pictures,
which
i
have
not
seen
and
which
are
not
connected
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
i
assume
so
but
you
cannot
relate
the
place
where
the
pictures
were
to
taken
to
where
the
observations
were
made.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
apparently,
there
are
sequences
here,
at
some
distances
from
the
plant,
he
stops
and
took
a
shot,
as
he
got
closer,
he
took
another
shot
and
then
he
took
another
shot.
then
he
took
his
observations
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
he
then
went
down
and
chatted
with
the
plant
management
at
least
two
of
the
locations
about
what
they
were
doing
to
come
into
compliance
with
statute
and
went
home.
there
are
issues,
potential
constitutional
issues
about
the
power
of
inspectors
of
this
type
to
enter
various
parts
and
aspects
of
industrial
premises
to
cross
fences
to
disregard
no
trespassing
signs,
and
there
maybe
issues
this
court
will
have
to
face
someday.
they
are
simply
not
presented
by
this
case
and
it
was
purely
interesting
hypothetical
questions
on
this
record.
since
the
right
being
asserted
is
western
alfalfa
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
well
if
it's
affirmed
then
the
only
possible
construction
is
that
whenever
an
inspector
enters
private
property
to
know
there
is
general
holding
out
to
the
public
to
enter,
that
we
have
fourth
amendment
problems
and
fourth
amendment
procedures
must
be
adhered
to
and
it
will
just
complicate
the
process
of
making
these
kinds
of
observations
and
other
observations
related
to
the
enforcement
of
regulatory
statutes.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes,
if
there
is
fourth
amendment
rights
and
that
has
to
be
noticed
to
either
get
consent
or
serve
the
warrant
and
they
are
just
closely
related.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
but
we
just
find
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
we
find
this
due
process
contention
quite
extraordinary.
law
enforcement
officials
daily
observe
without
notice
to
legal
acts
which
were
pleading
and
unreproducible
and
their
observations
are
nevertheless
considered
to
be
admissible
evidence.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
i
think
of
many
common
examples
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
this
is
matter
--
this
require
testimony
by
trained
observer.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
well,
as
an
example
it
occurs
to
me
as
to
his
speeding
where
observations
are
made
of
a
speeding
car
whether
they
would
be
based
on
time
or
they
used
a
radar,
require
a
certain
training
and
competence.
the
police
come
out
and
flag
the
car
down,
that
stops
the
movement,
where
is
the
driver
left?
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
well,
that
goes
to
the
question
as
to
whether
this
is
a
reliable
kind
of
observation
and
which
is
prohibitive
enough
to
be
admissible
in
to
evidence.
that's
a
separate
point.
it's
a
due
process
attack
upon
the
use
of
the
test.
on
that,
as
far
as
united
states
is
concerned,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
inclusion
of
these
types
of
emission
standards
and
state
implementation
plans
under
the
federal
air
pollution
control
act
has
been
required
by
the
environmental
protection
agency
because
they
in
the
judgment
of
that
agency
offer
the
only
feasible
type
of
standard
and
means
of
testing
which
can
be
feasibly
enforced
against
broad
range
of
emission
sources
on
continuing
basis
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
the
use
–
the
states
must
submit
the
implementation
plan
which
meets
the
federal
standards
which
are
set
about
administrator
of
the
environmental
protection
agency
under
the
federal
act.
one
of
the
things
that
state
implementation
plan
must
have
is
visible
emission
standards
and
that
means
opacity
and
ringelmann
type
standards.
it's
the
only
type
known
in
the
field,
the
reference
code
of
federal
regulations
sections
51.19
sub
c.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
no
there
are
visible
emission
standards
which
are
essentially
you
see
what
it
looks
like
and
there
are
certain
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that's
one
type
of
standards
and
other
type
of
standards
are
those
which
relate
to
the
actual
quantity
of
various
kinds
of
material
in
the
emission
which
require
a
very
expensive
and
complex
testing
of
the
emission
flow
during
the
actual
operation.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
no
it
can
be
--
once
you
set
up
operating
it
doesn't
take
a
long
period.
you
have
to
set
up
the
equipment
and
all
--
often
testing
equipment
is
brought
in
for
this
purposes
and
removed
because
of
its
expanse,
it's
delicate
nature
and
so
on.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
is
actual
testing
of
what
is
there.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
particulates,
that
is
correct.
now,
that
type
of
testing
cannot
be
simply
done
without
the
cooperation
and
advance
notice.
the
plant
is
expensive
and
it
is
the
judgment
of
federal
agency
that
if
they
have
to
rely
on
that
contesting
alone,
there
can
no
feasible
air
pollution
control
program
which
is
applicable
to
all
emission
of
all
types.
it
has
been
shown
the
case
--
let
me
say
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
district
of
columbia,
partland,
which
has
been
remanded
and
which
the
agency
is
working
on,
involves
an
opacity
standard
of
10%
which
is
very
close
to
clear.
and
the
question
that
the
court
raised
is
with
that
lower
standard,
you
could
make
reliable
observation
such
as
to
make
it
a
workable,
a
feasible
standard.
standard
here
40%
which
was
kind
of
half
dark
smoke.
the
observations
here
were
90%
which
means
that
they
were
practically,
completely
obscured
the
view.
the
factual
question
at
10%
is
quite
different
from
the
factual
question
presented
on
this
record.
my
time
is
running.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
well
the
general
problem
of
passage
of
time
as
it
affects
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
defend
himself
is
one
that
has
come
before
this
court
in
a
number
of
different
contexts.
the
general
approach
has
been
there
must
be
some
showing
of
prejudice.
now,
if
for
instance,
they
didn’t
get
notice
for
six
months
and
there
is
no
showing
of
any
reason
why
they
shouldn’t
have
noticed
it
more
promptly
and
they
show
that
in
that
period
they
had
quite
innocently
made
significant
changes
in
the
plant.
so,
that
they
weren’t
in
the
position
to
make
any
effort
to
reproduce
its
operation
and
demonstrate
that
it
in
fact
operated
within
the
standard.
that
for
instance
seems
to
be
prejudice
or
if
they
got
noticed
in
six
months
and
they
had
to
have
the
hearing
in
thirty
days
thereafter
and
they
said,
well
the
crop
season
is
over
we
would
like
to
run
the
plant
and
we
will
get
experts
out
and
we
will
show
that
it
is
running
like
it
runs,
it
is
clean.
the
state
said,
well,
you
have
to
have
the
hearing
now,
we
are
sorry
it
is
winter;
it
seems
to
me
that
would
be
prejudice.
but,
what
is
notably
absent
from
this
record
is
any
effort
by
the
company
to
conduct,
by
its
own
experts
a
ringelmann
opacity
observation
and
introduced
it
in
to
evidence.
indeed
on
page
73
of
the
record,
you
find
that
counsel
for
the
western
alfalfa
states.
he
says,
judging
from
the
testimony
i
hear
at
the
first
hearing,
unless
there
is
some
change
in
the
method
of
operation
of
these
dehydration
plants,
i
will
expect
the
staff
to
come
out
and
we
are
finding
ringelmann
violations.
his
view
seemed
to
be
that
--
if
we
go
through
this
again
--
the
staff
will
come
out
and
they
will
look
at
the
plants
and
they
say
that
this
is
more
than
40
%
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
they
offered
the
observation,
a
written
letter
to
them
from
their
hired
consultant,
one
mr.
roning,
who
was
not
qualified.
the
letter
didn’t
–
it
was
not
called
to
testify,
not
subject
to
cross
examination.
he
did
not
--
his
letter
didn’t
indicate
the
conditions
under
which
the
plants
were
operating.
it
was
just
totally
deficient
as
an
evidentiary
offer
and
was
made
--
in
fact
the
observations
were
taking
some
period
of
time
--.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
well,
both
offers
are
defective
for
reasons
shown
in
the
record.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
it
was
simply
they
submitted
the
letter.
there
were
no
applicable
rules
of
evidence.
they
want
to
put
something
in,
they
put
it
in.
but
you
look
at
the
letter
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
i
think
they
could
have
made
it
by
showing
that
by
evidence
that
under
those
operating
conditions
have
been
in
effect
on
june
6th,
these
plants
don’t
emit
emission
--
this
level
of
opacity.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
oh,
we
certainly
would.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
well,
we
have
reports,
environmental
protection
agency,
from
inspectors
that
when
they
do
come
on
some
plants,
when
they
give
notice,
it
certainly
turns
out,
the
plant
finishes
its
run
and
seems
they
are
going
home
for
the
day
and
the
inspector
can
wait,
may
be
he
can
sit
around
and
well,
the
next
day
or
he
has
many
other
inspections
to
make
and
he
leaves
and
when
he
leaves
we
get
words,
the
plant
is
running
again.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
is
correct
and
we
do
present
credentials,
but
we
would
like
to
leave
the
option
for
statutory
flexibility.
if
the
experience
on
these
acts
shows
if
there
are
problems
of
particular
types.
also
i
think
there
is
an
open
question
on
the
federal
statue
as
to
whether
these
kinds
of
opacity
--
presumably
on
the
federal
statues,
these
kinds
of
opacity
observations
can
be
made
under
the
fourth
amendment
from
property
open
to
the
public
and
which
no
special
governmental
right
of
entry
has
to
be
ascertained
and
the
due
process
theory
would
require
the
opacity
observation
made
from
the
public
highway
not
be
made,
unless
notice
is
given
in
advance.
in
some
of
these
plants,
they
can
turn
on
the
scrubbers,
turn
off
the
scrubbers,
the
precipitators
and
so
on
and
it
saves
the
money
not
to
have
them
on.
and
hired
inspectors
can’t
be
everywhere
all
the
time.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes,
so
it
is
always
a
question
of
degree,
we
are
not
doing
it.
that
is
right.
thank
you.
