right,
but
i
will
ask
you
one
question.
this
company
had
notice
in
effect
in
12
days
as
i
recall,
after
these
tests
were
made.
i
gave
it
some
opportunity
to
go
ahead
and
have
test
of
its
own
made
--
would
you
be
troubled
if
the
first
time
the
company
heard
of
this
was
say
six
months
later,
the
quality
of
air
is
ephemeral
favorable
condition
and
wouldn't
have
done
the
company
much
good
so
far
preparing
to
defend
itself,
if
six
months
later
you
have
been
told
that
on
a
