mr.
mellon,
before
you
proceed,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
the
state's
attorney
would
require
us
one
evidence
before
he
issued
an
information
or
would
he
rely,
say,
on
an
affidavit
from
the
policeman?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
from
the
officer
--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
before
a
court
reporter?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
the
state
attorney
adhere
to,
say,
the
same
standards
of
requiring
probable
cause
that
a
magistrate
would
before
issuing
a
search
warrant
or
arrest
warrant?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understood
from
prior
argument
that
there
were
two
types
of
arrests
that
were
involved
primarily,
arrest
made
in
the
field
by
an
officer
to
bear
witness
to
crime
or
there
were
accident
circumstances
justifying
arrest.
in
those
circumstances,
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
arrest.
now,
i
understand
you
to
say
that
where
the
states
attorney
issues
a
warrant
for
arrest
on
the
basis
of
testimony
of
a
police
officer,
sworn
testimony,
that
probable
cause
is
created
by
that
act,
that
is,
the
issuance
of
the
warrant
by
the
states
attorney.
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
the
next
question
i
was
going
to
ask
you
is
that
you
accept
or
you
agree
that
there
is
probable
cause
there
even
though
the
state's
attorney
is
not
an
impartial
officer.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
about
the
florida
practice
where
there
is
an
indictment
pursuant
to
a
grand
jury.
what
is
your
position
as
to
an
adversary
hearing
to
determine
whether
there
was
probable
cause
for
the
issuance
of
the
indictment?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
involves
a
florida
procedure
where
an
arrest
is
made
without
a
warrant.
the
suspect
may
then
be
charged
upon
information
about
a
prosecuting
attorney
and
held
in
jail
pending
the
other
steps
in
a
criminal
process.
these
steps
usually
include
a
bail
hearing,
the
arraignment
and
the
trial
itself.
we
hold
today
that
the
information
filed
by
the
prosecutor
standing
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
justify
detention
pending
trial.
rather,
the
fourth
amendment
requires
a
fair
and
reliable
determination
of
probable
cause
as
a
condition
to
any
significant
pretrial
restraint
on
liberty.
moreover,
this
determination
must
be
made
by
a
judicial
officer
promptly
following
arrest.
but
we
do
not
however
accept
respondent's
argument
that
a
full
adversary
hearing
with
counsel,
confrontation
and
cross-examination
of
witnesses
is
required
by
the
constitution
at
this
stage.
the
determination
of
probable
cause
for
detention
is
merely
the
first
step
in
the
elaborate
criminal
justice
system
designed
to
safeguard
the
rights
of
those
accused
of
criminal
conduct.
at
this
initial
stage
we
think
a
mini-trial
is
not
required
by
the
constitution
and
indeed
is
not
necessarily
in
the
interest
of
either
the
suspect
or
society.
accordingly
and
for
the
reasons
more
fully
set
forth
in
our
opinion
filed
today
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part
the
decision
in
this
case
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
parts
1
and
2
of
the
court's
opinion
and
concurring
in
other
respects
as
to
parts
3
and
