justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
not
stated
expressly
in
the
new
rules,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you
this?
i
take
it
the
claim
is
not
that
the
convictions
that
occur
without
the
preliminary
hearing
should
be
automatically
reversed?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
issue
here
is
pretrial
custody.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
is
a
1983
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
brought
in
the
district
court,
was
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
1983
action,
as
a
federal
--
asserting
that
that
was
a
denial
of
the
constitutional
rights
by
pretrial
detention
without
a
preliminary
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
it
is
a
1983
action
in
a
sense
that
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
rested
on
1983,
but
it
has
only
to
do
with
custody,
does
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
think
that
florida
--
does
florida
have
something
akin
to
habeas
corpus
that
permits
a
person
to
challenge
a
pretrial
custody?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
of
course
--
as
far
as
custody
is
concerned,
if
a
person
is
on
bail,
he
is
considered
in
custody,
i
suppose.
to
some
extent,
he
is
under
restraint.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
do
you
think
rather
than
bringing
this
1983
action,
the
petitioners
here
could
have
filed
for
habeas
corpus
in
florida
challenging
their
pretrial
detention?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
--
well,
which
would
have
encompassed
the
preliminary
hearing
issue,
i
suppose.
how
about
federal
habeas?
justice
byron
r.
white
surely
the
preliminary
hearing,
as
mr.
justice
stewart
suggests,
would
also
result
in
his
release
if
it
was
held
that
there
was
not
probable
cause.
now,
forget
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
discovery
for
a
moment
and
why
don’t
you
address
yourself
to
whether
or
not
it’s
constitutional
to
continue
to
hold
a
man
after
the
information
is
filed
even
in
the
absence
of
a
judicial
determination.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
the
point
--
justice
byron
r.
white
those
are
the
ones
you
are
talking
about
in
this
case.
that’s
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
at
the
outset,
was
preiser
against
rodgriguez
cited
at
all
or
considered
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
custody
was
the
only
thing
that
was
at
issue
in
the
sense
that
if
there
had
been
no
pretrial
incarceration
and
just
a
summons
to
come
to
court
at
a
certain
time,
this
case
wouldn’t
have
arisen,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
it
wasn’t?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
release.
justice
byron
r.
white
your
object
was
never
to
be
released.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
but—
justice
byron
r.
white
the
question
i
asked
is
if
preiser
had
been
considered
it
all
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
you
say
it
was
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the
question
is
the
form
of
your
action
in
the
federal
court,
whether
it
should
be
federal
habeas
corpus
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
we
would
have
--
then
you
would
certainly
focus
on
and
have
the
district
court’s
judgment
as
to
whether
there
was
a
local
remedy.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
we
do
not
have
now.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
district
court
say
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
they
say
so?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
federal
--
state
habeas?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
disagree
with
your
opponent
here?
he
suggests
that
state
habeas
might
be
available.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wonder
about
that.
i
understand
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
address
themselves
to
the
younger
problem
and
said
it
was
not
applicable
or
at
least
didn’t
control
here
for
at
least
one
of
the
reasons
you
give.
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
something
which
i’m
not
sure
would
be
an
answer
to
the
exhaustion
requirement
of
the
federal
habeas
corpus
case
which
is
considerably
different.
the
court
of
appeals
said
“while
the
plaintiffs
might
have
filed
suit
in
state
court
for
declaratory
judgment
and
other
equitable
relief,”
based
upon
the
same
grounds
as
in
this
suit,
it
may
be
true
there
wouldn’t
be
a
remedy
in
the
criminal
case.
that
doesn’t
mean
that
in
an
independent
action
there
would
not
be
relief
available
in
the
state
courts.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be,
but
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
whom
are
we
supposed
to
believe?
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
there
they
could
have
sought
the
same
grounds,
that
this
remedy
was
open
to
them.
now,
it
may
be
that
the
answer
on
the
merits
has
been
foreclosed
in
the
state
courts,
maybe
that’s
true
because
that’s
what
you’re
talking
about,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn’t
that
the
remedy
--
that
there
isn’t
a
procedural
remedy
available.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
that’s
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
go
ahead
then.
justice
