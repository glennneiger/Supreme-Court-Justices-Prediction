justice
potter
stewart
mr.
mellon,
i
wonder
if
i
can
interrupt
you
to
ask
you
if
you
can
help
me
get
cleared
the
chronology
of
how
this
happens.
is
there,
first,
an
arrest
by
a
policeman
presumably,
at
least
as
far
as
this
case
goes,
a
valid
arrest
because
no
arrest
is
being
attacked
in
this
case
and
then,
the
policeman
comes
to
the
prosecutor,
the
county,
and
gives
him
the
case
that
he
thinks
he
has
against
the
man.
then,
the
prosecutor
files
the
information.
or,
does
the
information
come
first
and
then
is
followed
by
an
arrest?
justice
potter
stewart
after
the
arrestee
is
in
custody?
justice
potter
stewart
so,
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
the
arrest
follows
the
issuance
of
the
information
and
it’s
by
virtue
of
a
habeas
issued
by
the
prosecuting
official.
justice
potter
stewart
by
the
same
man
who
files
the
information
presumably.
justice
potter
stewart
acting
in
the
prosecutor’s
behest,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
issued
by
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
now
that
i
have
interrupted
you
can
you
tell
me
what
determines,
in
florida
procedure,
whether
a
prosecution
is
to
be
initiated
by
information
or
whether
it
is
to
be
instituted
by
a
grand
jury
indictment.
justice
potter
stewart
and
are
they,
in
fact,
prosecuted
by
information
or
are
they
sometimes
prosecuted
by
grand
jury
indictment,
other
crimes?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
determines
that?
who
is
it
who
decides
it
and
on
what
criteria?
justice
potter
stewart
and
as
i
understand
it,
most
mind-run
criminal
offenses
are
preceded
against
by
information.
capital
cases
have
to
go
by
way
of
indictment
and
some
cases
involving
official
corruption
and
so
on
go
by
way
of
indictment,
but
most
mind-run
criminal
offenses
are
initiated,
the
prosecution
is
initiated
by
information.
is
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
do
i
understand
that
correctly?
justice
potter
stewart
now
is
this
case
confined
in
dade
county,
florida
or
is
this
a
statewide
problem
or
question?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
say
there
is
any
--
some
state
remedy
available
whether
or
not
an
information
has
been
filed?
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
this
first
appearance?
that
is
not
clear
to
me.
i
am
looking
at
the
rule
as
effective
on
march
1,
1974,
that
is
this
month,
the
first
of
this
month,
which
the
general
rule
seems
to
be,
in
all
cases
where
the
defendant
is
in
custody,
except
capital
offenses,
the
preliminary
hearing
shall
be
held
within
96
hours
from
the
time
of
the
defendant’s
first
appearance.
now,
when
is
the
first
appearance?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
is
the
function
of
that
first
appearance?
justice
potter
stewart
he
is
advised
of
his
rights,
but
is
any
determination
at
all
made
by
that
magistrate
as
to
the
reason
why
he
is
being
confined?
justice
potter
stewart
not
at
the
first
appearance.
justice
potter
stewart
and
so
the
--
and
that
has
to
occur
within
24
hours
of
his
apprehension.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
go
ahead.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
every
county
there
is
a
first
appearance
within
24
hours
after
apprehension,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
rule
provides
that
the
preliminary
hearing
shall
be
held
within
96
hours,
that’s
four
days,
from
the
time
of
his
first
appearance
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
as
i
understand
it,
that
is
unless
an
information
has
in
the
mean
time
been
filed.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
the
system.
justice
potter
stewart
well
not
involved
here,
as
i
understand
it,
but
the
people
who
are
in
custody
as
a
result
of
grand
jury
indictments
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
this
is
done
before
a
magistrate.
that’s
just
in
dade
county,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
statewide?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
the
claim
and
that’s
the
issue
in
this
case
is
that
if
he
is
in
there
within
96
hours
with
his
information
then
the
man
stays
in
custody,
if
he
cannot
make
bail,
indefinitely
without
any
hearing
as
to
probable
cause
--
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
the
issue
is
in
this
case,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
that’s
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
he’s
not
talking
about
any
opportunity
not
to
the
lack
of
opportunity
to
prepare
himself
for
trial.
he
is
talking
about
being
locked
up
on
the
basis
of
an
information
with
no
preliminary
hearing
as
to
any
probable
cause
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
locked
up
only
on
the
say-so
of
a
prosecutor.
that
is
what
the
issue
is
here,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he’s
talking
about
being
locked
up
for
60
days
or
90
days
on
a
say-so
of
a
prosecutor.
now,
that’s
the
only
issue
before
us,
as
i
understand
it
and
maybe
i
wholly
misapprehend
his
case
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
there’s
a
case
called
bernie
against
indiana,
i
think,
that
probably
cuts
the
other
way
from
what
you
just
told
us.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
by
definition,
hasn’t
there
in
this
case
been
an
arrest
on
probable
cause?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
don’t
get
a
motion
to
suppress
--
i
mean,
these
procedures
in
the
states
vary
but
sometimes
that
doesn’t
happen
until
the
actual
trial
that
you
are
allowed
the
motion
to
suppress.
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
here
there
has
been,
as
i
understood
you
to
agree,
a
taking
into
custody
on
probable
cause.
justice
potter
stewart
for
arrest
of
the
person.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
the
basic
element
test
comes
in
the
trial
of
the
criminal
offense,
doesn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
ultimate
test.
justice
potter
stewart
isn’t
this
procedure
very
similar
to
the
procedure
under
rule
5
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
when
is
a
defendant
in
a
federal
trial
first
told
of
his
right
to
be
indicted
by
grand
jury
before
he’d
be
tried?
because,
the
fact
is,
many
felonies
in
the
federal
system
are
commenced
by
the
filing
of
informations
and
a
waiver.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
when
in
the
federal
system
is
the
defendant
first
given
his
opportunity
to
waive?
justice
potter
stewart
there’s
no
requirement
under
rule
5
that
he’d
be
told
that.
justice
potter
stewart
you
often
wouldn’t
have
counsel.
it’s
at
that
first
appearance
that
he’s
advised
of
his
right
to
counsel,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
have
any
reason
to
suppose
that
basic
practice
is
very
much
different
in
the
federal
system
with
respect
to
informations?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
in
the
federal
system
if
there
has
been
an
arrest
with
a
warrant
and
the
person
is
brought
before
a
magistrate
whose
only
function,
if
the
arrest
has
been
with
a
warrant,
is
to
advise
him
of
his
rights
which
is
like
the
first
hearing
in
florida.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
is
then
in
custody
and
there
has
to
be
a
preliminary
hearing
within
10
days
except
that
the
preliminary
examination
shall
not
be
held
if
the
defendant
is
indicted
or
if
an
information
against
the
defendant
is
filed
before
the
date
set
for
the
preliminary
examination.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
if
an
information
is
filed,
then
he
comes
up
before
the
district
court
and
not
until
then
does
he
have
an
opportunity
to
be
told
of
his
right
to
be
indicted
rather
than
be
informed
against.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i’m
talking
about
a
felony
now.
i
am
talking
about
a
felony
in
which
there
is
a
constitutional
right
not
to
be
proceeded
against
except
by
indictment.
but,
he’s
not
told
about
that
until
he
appears
in
open
court
in
the
district
court
under
rule
7.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i’m
just
suggesting
that
that
federal
system
is
basically
the
same
as
the
florida
system
and
it
doesn’t
mean
that
it’s
valid
but
it
does
mean
that
these
rules
annunciated
by
this
court
are
unconstitutional
if
you’re
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
federal
system,
if
the
arrest
has
been
without
a
warrant,
then
the
magistrate
has
the
duty
of
finding
probable
cause.
and
to
that
extent,
the
federal
system
is
unlike
the
state
system
of
florida.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
when
he
comes
before
the
magistrate,
if
the
arrest
has
been
without
a
warrant,
it’s
the
magistrate’s
duty
to
find
probable
cause
and
if
he
doesn’t
find
it,
the
man
is
released,
as
i
read
rule
5
of
the
federal
system.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
that
makes
it
different.
now,
were
these
arrests
with
or
without
warrants?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
differentiate
the
two
systems.
justice
potter
stewart
while
they’re
in
custody
as
a
result
of
valid
arrests.
justice
potter
stewart
they’re
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
perhaps
i’m
being
repetitious
and
perhaps
i
don’t
understand
your
point
but
thousands
of
times
everyday
in
this
country
people’s
liberty
is
taken
away
when
they’re
arrested
by
law
enforcement
officers
on
probable
cause.
justice
potter
stewart
they’re
taken
down
to
jail
and
locked
up.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
is
your
--
are
you
attacking
that,
that
there
cannot
be
an
arrest
and
a
custodial
arrest
on
probable
cause?
justice
potter
stewart
when?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
say
in
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
if
it’s
constitutionally
valid
for
24
hours,
why
isn’t
it
valid
for
36
hours
or
48
hours?
justice
potter
stewart
you
can
see
that
it’s
valid
for
a
period
of
time
after
a
lawful
arrest,
can’t
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
isn’t
possibly.
by
definition,
they’re
being
arrested
on
probable
cause.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
point
of
an
arrest
warrant
is
to
test
the
probable
cause,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
before
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
justice
potter
stewart
a
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
you’re
not
really
saying
that,
are
you?
because
you’ve
already
conceded,
in
answer
to
my
question,
that
thousands
of
people
are
deprived
of
their
liberty
everyday
in
the
various
jurisdictions
of
this
country
upon
an
ex
parte
hearing
and/or
upon
no
hearing
at
all
on
arrest
upon
probable
cause.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you’re
not
saying
that
nobody
can
constitutionally
be
deprived
of
his
liberty
without
an
adversary
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
know
that.
but
then
you
say,
on
the
other
hand,
what
your
argument
really
is,
you’re
telling
us,
is
that
nobody
can
be
deprived
of
his
liberty
except
by
an
adversary
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i’m
suggesting
you’re
not
really
saying
that
either.
justice
potter
stewart
because,
as
i’ve
--
as
you
conceded,
people
are
deprived
of
their
liberties
by
the
thousands
everyday
without
prior
adversary
hearings.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
isn’t
to
me.
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
were
clear,
i
wouldn’t
be
asking
you
these.
if
it
were
clear
to
me,
i
wouldn’t
be
asking
these
questions.
justice
potter
stewart
in
florida
system
it’s
10
days?
justice
potter
stewart
unless
an
information
has
been
filed.
justice
potter
stewart
then
there’s
none.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
mellon,
i
wonder
if
i
can

to

right,

and

that

you
can
you
tell

what
determines,
in

justice

what

who

is
that

justice

do

justice

now
is
this

justice

stewart
not
at

justice
potter
stewart
and
so
the
--
and
that
has
to
occur
within
24
hours
of
his
apprehension.
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
go
ahead.
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
every
county
there
is
a
first
appearance
within
24
hours
after
apprehension,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
the
rule
provides
that
the
preliminary
hearing
shall
be
held
within
96
hours,
that’s
four
days,
from
the
time
of
his
first
appearance
and
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
then,
as
i
understand
it,
that
is
unless
an

has
in
the

been

is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
the
system.
justice
potter
stewart
well
not
involved
here,
as
i
understand
it,
but
the
people
who
are
in
custody
as
a
result
of
grand
jury
indictments
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
say
this
is
done
before
a
magistrate.
that’s
just
in
dade
county,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
statewide?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
the
claim
and
that’s
the

in
this
case
is
that
if
he
is
in
there
within
96
hours
with
his
information
then
the
man
stays
in
custody,
if
he
cannot
make
bail,
indefinitely
without
any
hearing
as
to
probable
cause
--
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
the
issue
is
in
this
case,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
that’s
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
he’s
not
talking
about
any
opportunity
not
to
the
lack
of
opportunity
to
prepare
himself
for
trial.
he
is
talking
about
being
locked
up
on
the
basis
of
an
information
with
no
preliminary
hearing
as
to
any
probable
cause
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
locked
up
only
on
the
say-so
of
a
prosecutor.
that
is
what
the
issue
is
here,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he’s
talking
about
being
locked
up
for
60
days
or
90
days
on
a
say-so
of
a
prosecutor.
now,
that’s
the
only
issue
before
us,
as
i
understand
it
and
maybe
i
wholly
misapprehend
his
case
but
--
justice
potter
stewart
there’s
a
case
called
bernie
against
indiana,
i
think,
that
probably
cuts
the
other
way
from
what
you
just
told
us.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
by
definition,
hasn’t
there
in
this
case
been
an
arrest
on
probable
cause?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
you
don’t
get
a
motion
to
suppress
--
i
mean,
these
procedures
in
the
states
vary
but
sometimes
that
doesn’t
happen
until
the
actual
trial
that
you
are
allowed
the
motion
to
suppress.
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
here
there
has
been,
as
i
understood
you
to
agree,
a
taking
into
custody
on
probable
cause.
justice
potter
stewart
for
arrest
of
the
person.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
the
basic
element
test
comes
in
the
trial
of
the
criminal
offense,
doesn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
ultimate
test.
justice
potter
stewart
isn’t
this
procedure
very
similar
to
the
procedure
under
rule
5
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
when
is
a
defendant
in
a
federal
trial
first
told
of
his
right
to
be
indicted
by
grand
jury
before
he’d
be
tried?
because,
the
fact
is,
many
felonies
in
the
federal
system
are
commenced
by
the
filing
of
informations
and
a
waiver.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
when
in
the
federal
system
is
the
defendant
first
given
his
opportunity
to
waive?
justice
potter
stewart
there’s
no
requirement
under
rule
5
that
he’d
be
told
that.
justice
potter
stewart
you
often
wouldn’t
have
counsel.
it’s
at
that
first
appearance
that
he’s
advised
of
his
right
to
counsel,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
would
you
have
any
reason
to
suppose
that
basic
practice
is
very
much
different
in
the
federal
system
with
respect
to
informations?
justice
potter
stewart
alright,
in
the
federal
system
if
there
has
been
an
arrest
with
a
warrant
and
the
person
is
brought
before
a
magistrate
whose
only
function,
if
the
arrest
has
been
with
a
warrant,
is
to
advise
him
of
his
rights
which
is
like
the
first
hearing
in
florida.
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
is
then
in
custody
and
there
has
to
be
a
preliminary
hearing
within
10
days
except
that
the
preliminary
examination
shall
not
be
held
if
the
defendant
is
indicted
or
if
an
information
against
the
defendant
is
filed
before
the
date
set
for
the
preliminary
examination.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
if
an
information
is
filed,
then
he
comes
up
before
the
district
court
and
not
until
then
does
he
have
an
opportunity
to
be
told
of
his
right
to
be
indicted
rather
than
be
informed
against.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i’m
talking
about
a
felony
now.
i
am
talking
about
a
felony
in
which
there
is
a
constitutional
right
not
to
be
proceeded
against
except
by
indictment.
but,
he’s
not
told
about
that
until
he
appears
in
open
court
in
the
district
court
under
rule
7.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i’m
just
suggesting
that
that
federal
system
is
basically
the
same
as
the
florida
system
and
it
doesn’t
mean
that
it’s
valid
but
it
does
mean
that
these
rules
annunciated
by
this
court
are
unconstitutional
if
you’re
correct.
justice
potter
stewart
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
federal
system,
if
the
arrest
has
been
without
a
warrant,
then
the
magistrate
has
the
duty
of
finding
probable
cause.
and
to
that
extent,
the
federal
system
is
unlike
the
state
system
of
florida.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
when
he
comes
before
the
magistrate,
if
the
arrest
has
been
without
a
warrant,
it’s
the
magistrate’s
duty
to
find
probable
cause
and
if
he
doesn’t
find
it,
the
man
is
released,
as
i
read
rule
5
of
the
federal
system.
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
and
that
makes
it
different.
now,
were
these
arrests
with
or
without
warrants?
justice
potter
stewart
that
would
differentiate
the
two
systems.
justice
potter
stewart
while
they’re
in
custody
as
a
result
of
valid
arrests.
justice
potter
stewart
they’re
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
perhaps
i’m
being
repetitious
and
perhaps
i
don’t
understand
your
point
but
thousands
of
times
everyday
in
this
country
people’s
liberty
is
taken
away
when
they’re
arrested
by
law
enforcement
officers
on
probable
cause.
justice
potter
stewart
they’re
taken
down
to
jail
and
locked
up.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what
is
your
--
are
you
attacking
that,
that
there
cannot
be
an
arrest
and
a
custodial
arrest
on
probable
cause?
justice
potter
stewart
when?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
say
in
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
if
it’s
constitutionally
valid
for
24
hours,
why
isn’t
it
valid
for
36
hours
or
48
hours?
justice
potter
stewart
you
can
see
that
it’s
valid
for
a
period
of
time
after
a
lawful
arrest,
can’t
you?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
isn’t
possibly.
by
definition,
they’re
being
arrested
on
probable
cause.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
point
of
an
arrest
warrant
is
to
test
the
probable
cause,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
before
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
justice
potter
stewart
a
warrant.
justice
potter
stewart
you’re
not
really
saying
that,
are
you?
because
you’ve
already
conceded,
in
answer
to
my
question,
that
thousands
of
people
are
deprived
of
their
liberty
everyday
in
the
various
jurisdictions
of
this
country
upon
an
ex
parte
hearing
and/or
upon
no
hearing
at
all
on
arrest
upon
probable
cause.
justice
potter
stewart
so
you’re
not
saying
that
nobody
can
constitutionally
be
deprived
of
his
liberty
without
an
adversary
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
are
you?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
know
that.
but
then
you
say,
on
the
other
hand,
what
your
argument
really
is,
you’re
telling
us,
is
that
nobody
can
be
deprived
of
his
liberty
except
by
an
adversary
hearing.
justice
potter
stewart
and
i’m
suggesting
you’re
not
really
saying
that
either.
justice
potter
stewart
because,
as
i’ve
--
as
you
conceded,
people
are
deprived
of
their
liberties
by
the
thousands
everyday
without
prior
adversary
hearings.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
isn’t
to
me.
justice
potter
stewart
if
it
were
clear,
i
wouldn’t
be
asking
you
these.
if
it
were
clear
to
me,
i
wouldn’t
be
asking
these
questions.
justice
potter
stewart
in
florida
system
it’s
10
days?
justice
potter
stewart
unless
an
information
has
been
filed.
justice
potter
stewart
then
there’s
none.
