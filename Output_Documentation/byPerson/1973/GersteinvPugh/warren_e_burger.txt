chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
73-477,
gerstein
against
pugh.
mr.
mellon,
before
you
proceed,
i
observed
we
have
allowed
an
hour-and-a
half
here.
having
allowed
it,
we
will
honor
that.
but,
it
appears
to
us
that
this
may
not
warrant
it
and
if
you,
gentlemen,
can
shorten
your
submission,
it
will
help.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
a
time
limit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
which
he
must
act.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
of
the
circuits
in
the
federal
system
have
held
that
there
need
be
no
preliminary
hearing
once
an
indictment
is
returned.
what
is
the
--
do
you
know
the
fifth
circuit
situation
on
that
score?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
marky.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
one
way
of
summary
judgment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
makes
quite
a
difference,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
there’s
a
difference
to
morrissey
because
the
man
that
you
are
talking
about
here
is
going
to
be
the
man
who
prosecutes
and
presents
the
evidence
against
him.
he’s
had
to
make
the
preliminary
determination
that
it
was
a
prosecutable
offense
and,
in
that
sense,
coolidge
has
something
to
do
with
it
because
it
might
be
thought
difficult
for
him
to
dissociate
his
decision
on
the
first
stage
from
his
responsibilities
on
the
second.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
there
you’ve
had
a
dozen
or
more
people
making
the
decision
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
distinguished
from
one,
and
a
dozen
or
more
do
not
have
any
further
obligation
with
respect
to
the
prosecution.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
court,
at
that
stage,
wasn’t
addressing
itself
to
the
narrow
problem
that’s
before
us
here
today
though.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
functionally,
it’s
one
thing
to
say
that
functionally
the
information
charged
by
the
prosecutor
is
the
same
as
the
action
of
the
grand
jury
but
that
doesn’t
mean
it’s
the
same
for
all
purposes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
resume
at
this
point
after
lunch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
rogow,
you
may
proceed
when
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there’s
a
footnote,
i
think,
in
your
brief
or
one
of
the
briefs
about
what
has
happened
to
the
respondent
in
this
case.
what’s
his
posture
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
talking
about
the
class
action
aspect.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you
are
not,
then,
seeking
any
relief
with
respect
to
the
respondent
but
only
to
those
who
are
similarly
situated.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
morrissey
against
brewer,
do
you
really
think
we
went
that
far
to
say
he
must
be
neutral
and
detached
or
did
we
way
that
it
must
be
a
probation
officer
other
than
the
one
who
has
been
supervising
his
release?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
doesn’t
necessarily
make
him
neutral
and
detached
anymore
than
in
goldberg
and
kelley
you
had
neutral
and
detached.
it
just
meant
a
person
who
had
not
had
a
prior
connection
with
the
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
might
not
be
the
same
prosecutor
anymore
than
it
would
be
the
same
probation
officer
or
the
same
agent
in
the
welfare
office.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
benjamin
rodriguez,
is
that
true
for
him?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
saying
that
every
time
a
person
is
arrested
there
must
be
a
prompt,
without
defining
that
now,
a
prompt
determination
of
probable
cause
by
a
neutral
agency.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whether
it’s
in
laying
aside
what
the
crime
is,
whether
warranted
or
unwarranted
arrest.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
didn’t
state
say
something
this
morning
about
the
right
to
move
forthwith
to
dismiss
which
would
afford
a
test
of
the
probable
cause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
or
would
your
problems
be
satisfied
if
florida
procedure
provided
that,
upon
request,
a
preliminary
probable
cause
hearing
would
be
held
forthwith?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
in
every
cell
there
was
a
sign
in
large
letters,
“upon
request
of
preliminary
hearing
to
inquire
into
the
probable
cause
for
your
arrest
and
detention
will
be
granted
to
you
within
24
hours.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
a
great
many
people
who
are
arrested
have
no
interest
whatever
in
a
preliminary
hearing
on
probable
cause?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don’t
think
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
every
one
of
them?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
wouldn’t
--
on
the
contrary,
isn’t
it
ordinary
human
experience
that
most
of
them
would
recognize
that
they
have
committed
some
crime
and
that
they’re
not
interested
in
a
preliminary
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
we
come
back
to
where
i
was.
then
your
answer
to
my
question
is
that,
if
they
are
offered
a
prompt
hearing
that
would
satisfy
the
due
process
complaint
that
you
are
urging
on
the
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
say
it
must
be
done
within
a
reasonable
time,
that
is,
24,
48,
96,
some
--
chief
justice

relatively
short
time
much
like

of
the
federal,
“without
unnecessary
delay”
is
the
language
of
the
federal
rule.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
the
fifth
circuit
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
said
4-7
days,
didn’t
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
too
long
for
your
standard,
isn’t
it?
chief

e.

you,
