mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
florida,
the
state
attorney
absolutely
controls
the
question
of
probable
cause.
if
he
files
an
information,
there
is
no
right
to
be
heard
on
the
question
of
probable
cause.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
was
not,
your
honor,
but
it
has
no
application
in
this
case.
it
has
no
application,
one,
because
we
have
never
sought
release
from
custody
in
the
district
court.
all
we
sought
was
a
pretrial
procedural
right.
but,
even
if
the
court
felt
that
preiser
did
have
an
application
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
may
still
have
arisen
your
honor,
because
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
custody
might
still
be
a
valid
question.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
is
true
that
this
was
a
pure
custody
case,
but
my
point
is
that
all
we’re
asking
is
the
district
court
to
compel
there
to
be
a
preliminary
hearing
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
sir,
never.
never
ask
for
release.
the
decision
on
release
would
have
to
be
that
made
by
the
magistrate.
if
he
determined
there
was
no
probable
cause,
then
he
would
release
the
person.
the
state
magistrate
would.
nevertheless
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
only
if
there
is
no
probable
cause,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
in
offering
the
alternative
to
the
state
and
saying
“this
is
the
sanction,”
whereas,
a
statement
saying
“release
him.”
but
that
would
assume,
of
course,
that
the
state
would
fail
to
abide
by
the
constitutional
decision.
i
don’t
think
we
can
make
that
assumption,
but
if
i
may
divest
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
was
not
and
let
me
add
one
other
thing
regarding
preiser,
it’s
that
even
if
preiser
has
application
in
this
case,
state
remedies
were
futile
and
preiser
makes
it
quite
clear
that
there’s
no
need
to
attempt
habeas
corpus
in
state
court
if
it
were
to
be
futile
and
it
is
in
florida.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and
if
it
should
be
habeas
corpus.
if
the
court
felt
that
this
was
properly
a
habeas
corpus
matter,
we
think
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir,
but
it’s
quite
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
you
do,
your
honor.
i
think
the
record
is
absolutely
clear
that
there
is
no
local
remedy
throughout
this
litigation.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir,
and
the
fifth
circuit
said
so.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
said
that,
in
florida,
once
an
information
is
filed,
it
is
quite
clear
there
is
no
way
to
test
the
termination
of
probable
cause.
and
the
fifth
circuit,
in
a
footnote,
i
think,
in
their
decision
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
futile,
absolutely
futile,
because
once
the
information
is
filed
under
florida
law
you
cannot
go
behind
it
to
determine
probable
cause.
state
ex
rel.
hardy
versus
blount
makes
it
quite
clear
and
the
florida
decisions,
for
a
long
period
of
time,
make
it
quite
clear
that
a
state
habeas
corpus
charge
will
not
inquire
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
he
suggested
it,
but
he
did
not
address
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
would
be
futile.
he
said
you
could
file
a
habeas
corpus
petition,
but
we
are
telling
the
court
that
if
you
did
file
one,
it
would
be
a
futile
act,
an
empty
act
and
the
record
is
quite
clear
on
that
point.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
he
has
been
convicted,
your
honor,
and
he
is
in
jail
in
belle
glade,
florida.
but,
we
do
not
see
any
mootness
problem
here,
if
that
is
what
the
court
is
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
is
a
class
action,
but
it
is
also
a
problem
of
the
low
visibility
of
the
criminal
process,
one
which
is
“capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review.”
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir,
exactly.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
at
the
time
this
suit
was
filed,
all
the
named
parties
suffered
this
exact
deprivation.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
because
at
the
time
the
class
action
was
maintained
originally
in
the
district
court,
he
was
a
member
of
the
class
and
so
he
had
standing
at
that
point
and
the
class
action
survives
him.
but,
i
hasten
to
add
that
this
is
“capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review.”
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
am
sorry.
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
bernie
case,
but
i
am
familiar
with
the
cases
that
talk
about
“capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review.”
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
point
is
that
this
issue
would
never
be
litigated
in
the
30
or
60
or
90
days
in
which
that
custody
is
deprived.
there
would
be
no
way
ever
to
successfully
litigate
the
issue
and
the
court,
if
it
felt,
that
this
was
not
a
“capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review”
case,
would
relegate
people
to
having
no
opportunity
to
raise
the
issue
at
all
because
the
florida
law
is
clear
and
the
only
way
to
maintain
such
an
action
would
be
as
a
class
action
and
pointing
out
the
“capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review”
exception
to
mootness.
within
recent
--
i
should
back
up
and
point
out
that
even
if
a
preliminary
hearing
is
held
in
florida,
because
a
state
attorney
does
not
file
an
information,
the
state
attorney
can
overrule
the
discharge
at
that
preliminary
hearing.
if
the
magistrate
finds
out
probable
cause
and
the
state
attorney
is
unhappy
with
that
determination,
the
state
attorney
can
file
an
information
and
the
person
is
back
in
jail
again.
so,
i
hearken
back
to
my
original
statement
that
the
state
attorney
absolutely
controls
the
question
of
probable
cause.
within
recent
years,
this
court
has
held
that
before
a
person’s
welfare
check
may
be
taken,
before
their
wage
is
garnished,
before
their
driver’s
license
is
suspended,
there
must
be
a
prior
hearing.
this
case
presents
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
after
a
person’s
liberty
is
taken
there
is
a
right
to
a
subsequent
hearing.
and,
recently,
in
morrissey
versus
brewer
and
gagnon
versus
scarpelli
the
court
held
that
persons
whose
liberty
is
conditional,
people
on
parole,
on
probation
were
entitled
to
prompt
subsequent
preliminary
hearing.
once
it
was
determined
that
that
conditional
liberty
should
be
revoked.
we
are
talking
here
in
terms
of
absolute
liberty.
these
people
are
presumed
innocent
and
it
is
their
absolute
liberty
which
is
being
deprived.
the
right
to
which
we
seek
the
court
to
accord,
we
ask
the
court
to
accord
is
not
a
new
or
novel
right.
preliminary
hearings
are
ancient
institutions.
they
were
known
in
the
12th
century,
codified
in
the
16th
century,
used
in
the
colonies
before
and
after
the
revolution.
they
have
evolved
into
impartial
determinations
of
probable
cause
over
the
years
historically.
the
forerunner
of
the
preliminary
hearing,
which
we
asked
the
court
to
grant
today,
was
granted
in
the
case
of
aaron
burr
where
chief
justice
john
marshall
held
a
preliminary
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause
to
hold
aaron
burr
on
a
charge
of
treason.
and,
the
extent
of
that
inquiry
was
whether
or
not
an
offense
had
been
committed
and
whether
or
not
burr
had
committed
it.
and
that
is
the
kind
of
preliminary
hearing
which
we
are
talking
about,
and
it
has
been
known
long
ago
in
england
and
here,
and
the
marshall
hearing
was
held
in
1807.
our
position
is
that
the
information
process
cannot
determine
probable
cause
for
two
reasons,
one,
because
it
provides
none
of
the
elements
of
a
due
process
hearing.
there
is
no
right
for
the
defendant
to
be
heard.
there
is
no
right
to
confront
and
cross-examine
witnesses.
there
is
not
right
to
present
evidence.
so,
it
is
solely
an
ex
parte
non-adversarial
hearing
and
that
is
not
consistent
with
due
process.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir,
on
fourth
amendment
probable
cause.
what
we
are
seeking
is
the
test
of
that
fourth
amendment
determination.
it’s
interesting,
i
think,
to
note
that
if
evidence
is
seized
upon
a
warrant
stating
probable
cause,
you
contest
that
determination
by
a
motion
to
suppress.
but
here
in
florida,
you
cannot
test
the
taking
of
liberty.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i’m
not
sure
about
most
states.
in
florida,
you
can
move
to
suppress
certainly
before
trial
if
the
evidence
has
been
illegally
seized.
it
seems
that
if
the
evidence
has
been
illegally
seized
or
if
the
taking
of
the
body
is
improper,
to
have
to
wait
for
trial
and
remain
in
jail
during
all
that
time
only
to
find
out
six
months
later
that
there
really
is
no
case
at
all,
so
there
is
no
useful
purpose
for
a
defendant
or
for
the
state.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
fourth
amendment
probable
cause.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
for
arrest,
yes,
sir.
and
we
are
seeking
to
test
that
probable
cause
in
a
due
process
hearing
subsequent
to
the
taking.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well,
the
basic
element
of
the
test
at
that
point,
of
course,
if
a
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it’s
the
ultimate
test,
but
it
is
of
no
benefit
to
a
person
who’s
been
incarcerated
for
60
days
and
shouldn’t
be
there
in
the
first
place.
and,
that’s
what
the
preliminary
hearing
is
all
about
and
that’s
what
the
preliminary
hearing
in
morrissey
versus
brewer
was
all
about.
certainly,
ultimately,
the
taker
might
decide
that
there
is
reason
to
revoke
parole
or
probation.
there
should
be
a
preliminary
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
parole
or
probation
is
revoked.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
it
is
not.
rule
5
uses
informations
only
in
misdemeanor
cases.
they
can
only
be
used
in
felony
cases
if
a
defendant
waives
his
right
to
indictment.
so,
rule
5
involves
only
misdemeanors.
to
that
extent,
it
is
similar
because
this
case
also
presents
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
misdemeanors
are
entitled
to
preliminary
hearings
if
they,
too,
are
in
custody.
but,
it
is
a
limited
comparison.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and
a
waiver?
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
think,
probably
at
the
commissioner
hearing,
the
first
appearance
hearing,
he
might
be
told
that.
i
am
not
quite
sure.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
sir.
there
is
no
requirement
that
he’d
be
told
that,
but
he
would
obviously
have
counsel
at
the
first
appearance
hearing
before
the
commissioner.
and,
seemingly,
his
counsel
would
inform
him
that
if
he
makes
a
decision
that
he
wants
to
waive
indictment
that
he
could
be
preceded
against
by
information.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and
in
felony
cases,
it
seems
since
they’re
going
to
be
determining
bail
and
other
issues,
at
least
the
practice
in
florida
and
the
southern
district
of
florida
to
appoint
counsel
at
that
time.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
that
is
a
fourth
amendment
ex
parte
determination
of
probable
cause.
there
are
deficiencies
in
it
because
of
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
what
we
have
there
is
a
very
practical
kind
of
consideration.
i
cannot
concede
that
there
is
absolutely
pure
fourth
amendment
probable
cause
there
because
neither
the
state
attorney
nor
the
arresting
officer
is
a
neutral
and
detached
person.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
there
is
--
we
are
willing
to
have
the
state
attorney
or
a
police
officer
decide
that
there’s
probable
cause
and
make
an
arrest.
otherwise,
what
we’d
be
asking
for
would
be
a
prior
to
arrest
determination
of
probable
cause
and
we
don’t
ask
that
because
that
would
be
a
ridiculous
request
to
invite
possible
defendants
in
to
see
if
they’re
going
to
be
arrested
sometime
in
the
future.
it
would
work.
so
obviously,
when
the
balancing
process
takes
place,
you
have
to
allow
the
arresting
officer
to
make
that
quasi
determination
of
probable
cause
or
the
state
attorney
perhaps,
making
a
similar
quasi
determination
of
probable
cause,
neither
are
neutral
and
detached.
what
we’re
seeking
is
to
test
that
determination.
and
so,
it
is
a
flexible
kind
of
think
we’re
asking
after
the
taking
of
liberty,
an
opportunity
to
test
that
determination
that
was
made.
and
that
is
a
fourteenth
amendment
request
that
we’re
making
and
i
think
it’s
interesting
to
note
that
the
state
attorney
is
not
neutral
and
detached
not
only
under
the
fourth
amendment
but
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
morrissey
versus
brewer,
the
court
talked
about
one
of
the
essential
elements
of
a
due
process
hearing
is
to
have
that
hearing
conducted
by
a
neutral
and
detached
person.
and,
we
submit
that
the
state
attorney,
the
chief
prosecuting
officer,
certainly
in
not
neutral
and
detached
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
of
course,
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire
and
chadwick
versus
city
of
tampa,
he’s
certainly
not
neutral
and
detached
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
those
were
the
words
in
morrissey
versus
brewer
and
we
respect
those
words.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
or
will
not
have
a
future
connection
with
the
case.
in
other
words,
at
the
time
he
makes
a
decision,
he
is
not
involved
in
the
case
before
or
after.
the
prosecuting
attorney
is
the
chief
prosecutor.
he
is
involved
in
the
case
afterwards.
there
is
no
way
that
he
can
be
said
to
be
neutral
and
detached.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
but
we
are
talking
about
the
head
of
the
office,
the
state
attorney,
and
everyone
working
under
him
are
assistant
states
attorneys
so
he’s
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
he
is
the
one
to
whom
responsibility
finally
resides
and
he
is
the
one
who
signs
the
information.
he
is
the
one
who
charges
probable
cause.
it’s
true,
an
assistant
may
have
made
the
initial
determination
which,
i
think,
perhaps
in
some
way
underscores
the
kind
of
procedure
that
we
have
here.
and
this
record,
at
page
49
of
the
appendix,
reflects
that
a
police
officer
comes
in,
talks
to
an
assistant
state
attorney
perhaps
a
year
or
two
out
of
law
school,
and
tells
him
what
he
thinks
is
the
problem
or
what
the
gravamen
of
the
charge
is.
and
then,
the
assistant
prepares
the
information.
he
passes
it
on
to
another
deputy
state
attorney
who
looks
it
over.
and,
finally,
the
chief
state
attorney
signs
it.
so,
you’ve
got
three
people
in
this
process,
all
whom
are
rubberstamping
with
the
original
decision
made
by
an
assistant
who’s
working
under
the
direction
of
the
state
attorney.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
sir.
i
do
not
think
it’s
much
different
and,
to
be
quite
frank
to
the
court
--
if
we
were
correct,
if
a
person
in
custody
upon
an
information
is
entitled
to
a
preliminary
hearing
then,
under
rule
5c,
a
person
who’s
in
custody
prior
to
trial
in
the
federal
system
would
also
be
entitled
to
that
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well,
he
would
have
no
right
to
be
indicted
because
it
would
have
to
be
a
misdemeanor,
and
he
could
be
informed
against
it.
those
information
would
be
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and
the
question
is,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
that
person
would
have
a
right
to
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
that
would
be
true
if
we
are
correct.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
believe
that
the
assistant
us
attorney
could
file
an
information
after
the
arrest
in
a
misdemeanor
case
and
then
there
would
be
no
preliminary
hearing
conducted
by
the
magistrate.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
under
the
federal
rule.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
without
warrants,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
there
would
be
a
distinction
to
that
extent
between
the
two
systems,
but
i
think
there’s
another
distinction
that
has
to
be
raised
and,
that
is,
that
we’re
talking
about
people
who
were
in
custody
prior
to
trial.
and
in
the
federal
system
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir,
but
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
there
needs
to
be
an
opportunity
to
test
whether
or
not
that
is
a
valid
arrest
and
not
keep
a
man,
unless
he’s
been
indicted,
awaiting
trial
for
60
or
90
days
only
to
find
out
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
hold
him
during
all
that
time.
that’s
what
we’re
getting
at
in
this
case
and
that’s
what
the
issue
that’s
presented
in
this
case
is.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
if
he
is
in
custody,
yes,
sir,
except
for
indictments.
this
case
does
not
involve
indictments
at
all.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
it
does
involve
arrests
on
a
warrant.
even
if
that
warrant
is
issued,
i
may
add,
by
a
judge.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and
of
course,
the
question
that
was
raised
regarding
misdemeanors
takes
us
to
our
misdemeanor
argument
which
is
that
in
florida
they
have
a
classification
which
totally
excludes
misdemeanors
from
the
possibility
of
ever
getting
a
preliminary
hearing,
even
if
the
state
attorney
was
willing
to
tolerate
one.
the
classification
imposed
by
the
rule
is
that
there
is
no
right
to
preliminary
hearing
unless
you
charge
with
a
felony
and,
of
course,
unless
the
state
attorney
does
not
file
an
information.
that
classification
affects
a
fundamental
right,
the
right
not
to
have
your
liberty
taken
without
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
and,
our
position
is
that
there
is
no
compelling
reason
advanced
by
the
state
for
that
classification.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed.
the
district
court
agreed.
in
fact,
the
state
has
really
not
advanced
a
compelling
reason
nor
even
a
rational
reason
for
that
distinction
between
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
we’re
saying
there
can
be
a
custodial
arrest
on
probable
cause
but
there
must
be
a
subsequent
review.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
court
of
appeals
said,
adapted
to
the
florida
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
four
to
seven
days.
frankly,
i
say
within
24
hours
if
the
sides
are
prepared.
a
man’s
liberty
should
not
be
taken
away
for
more
than
24
hours
without
opportunity
to
test
it.
and,
we
look
to
argersinger
for
support
because
in
argersinger
the
court
said
you
cannot
take
away
a
man’s
liberty
for
24
hours
without
counsel
and,
now,
we
are
talking
about
taking
away
his
liberty
for
24
hours
or
more
without
even
a
hearing.
so
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
line
has
to
be
drawn
somewhere.
the
court
of
appeals
said
4-7
days.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
can
see
that
because
as
a
practical
matter,
it
has
to
be
because
there
is
no
other
way
in
which
the
state
can
carry
out
its
obligation
to
arrest
people
who
possibly
have
committed
crimes.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir,
untested
probable
cause
but
probable
cause,
which,
we
concede
is
sufficient
for
the
arrest.
the
question,
i
believe,
that
your
honor
asked
me
was
how
long
afterwards
must
that
probable
cause
be
tested.
and,
my
response
was
with
argersinger
24
hours,
but
the
fifth
circuit
said
4-7
days.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
not
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
but
there’s
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
but
there’s
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
that’s
a
fourth
amendment
probable
cause
determination,
ex
parte,
non-adversarial.
we
are
talking
about
a
due
process
opportunity
to
contest
or
test
that
fourth
amendment,
non-adversarial
determination
of
probable
cause
that’s
made.
and,
we
look
to
the
property
cases
which
say
that
before
your
property
is
taken
you
have
a
right
to
contest
that
taking.
and
all
we’re
saying
is
after
your
liberty
is
taken,
there
ought
to
be
a
right
to
contest
that
taking.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir,
if
the
state
court
had
permitted
us
to
test
probable
cause
through
habeas
corpus
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
sir,
we
would
not.
it
would
strictly
be
a
statement.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
florida
law
absolutely
forbids
an
inquiry
into
probable
cause
when
an
information
is
filed.
yes,
sir,
that
is
our
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
by
any
means,
because
information
stands
for
probable
cause.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that’s
right.
if
we
could
raise
it
successfully
in
florida
or
be
heard
on
it
in
florida,
we
wouldn’t
be
here.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well,
i
say
successfully
only
because
the
habeas
corpus
will
be
dismissed
in
florida
right
away
because
the
issue
that
would
be
raised
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
absolutely.
yes,
sir,
we
agree.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
when
you
say
do
you
need
it
automatic,
the
only
difficult
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
see.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
see
the
point
your
honor
makes.
i
may
back
off
a
little
bit
from
my
point
because
in
asserting
your
habeas
corpus
right,
it’s
incumbent
upon
you
to
test
probable
cause.
that
may
not
be
due
process.
i
really
--
this
case,
of
course,
was
raised
in
the
framework
of
the
existing
florida
law.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
not
a
hearing
on
everything,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
but
a
hearing,
certainly,
if
your
liberty
is
taken.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
motion
to
dismiss
which
the
state
spoke
about
can
be
traversed
merely
by
filing
a
traverse
by
the
state
attorney.
and
so,
the
state
attorney
can
dispute
whatever
statements
are
made
and
then
the
trial
judge
cannot
dismiss
the
case.
so,
again,
it’s
certainly
within
the
power
of
the
state
attorney
to
make
all
these
determinations
for
probable
cause.
that
motion
to
dismiss,
in
a
way,
i
suppose
is
really
illusory
because
all
the
state
need
do
is
not
acquiescent
it
and
it’s
an
unsuccessful
and
futile
remedy.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
think
that,
theoretically,
it
ought
to
be
the
state’s
obligation
to
provide
that
proceeding
in
which
a
person
can
test
whether
or
not
probable
cause
does
exist.
if
florida
had
a
different
procedure,
if
it
could
have
been
tested,
i
don’t
know
that
this
case
would
have
been
brought.
frankly,
we
just
had
not
fought
this
case
through
in
light
of
a
non-existent
situation.
the
situation
existed
and
that
was
what
we
were
addressing
ourselves
to.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
we
take
no
position
on
that
question.
we
do
not
say
that
after
an
indictment
there
must
be
an
adversarial
hearing.
in
order
to
say
that,
one
would
have
to
assume
that
the
historical
protections
which
this
court
has
found
in
the
indictment
procedures
no
longer
exist.
it
reminds
me
of
the
fact
that
john
peter
zenger,
when
he
was
sought
to
be
prosecuted
by
the
crown
twice,
they
sought
indictments
and
twice
they
failed.
and,
finally,
they
resorted
to
an
information
to
prosecute
him.
now,
if
the
protection
which
zenger
had
no
longer
exists,
then
perhaps
our
case
might
spawn
future
litigation.
but,
we
take
no
position
on
that
and
this
record
does
not
accord
the
court
an
opportunity
to
get
to
that
question
because
there
is
no
showing
that
indictments
do
not
really
protect
the
individual.
the
cases
cited
by
the
state,
hertado,
lem
woon,
ocampo,
beck
have
no
application
in
this
case.
those
cases
--
hertado,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
was
an
information
filed
after
a
preliminary
hearing.
so,
hertado
certainly
has
no
real
effect
on
this
case.
the
other
cases
talk
about
the
fact
that
there
is
no
need
for
a
preliminary
hearing
prior
to
the
issuance
of
an
information,
and
we
agree
with
that
position.
fine,
let
the
information
issue
but
after
the
information
issue
there
must
be
a
subsequent
determination
of
probable
cause.
there’s
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
might.
i
just
--
as
a
pure
due
process
matter,
we
think
it’s
incumbent
upon
the
state.
if
you
can
make
the
request
and
it
be
granted,
notwithstanding
the
filing
of
the
information,
that
would
certainly
lessen
our
argument
somewhat.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
approaches
the
question
really
of
waiver.
if
one
fails
to
assert
that
right
he
would,
in
effect,
have
been
waiving
his
right
and
i
think
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
certainly
don’t
think
that.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
think
the
people
would
want
an
inquiry
on
probable
cause.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
i
would
not
say
every
one
of
them.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and,
of
course,
they
could
waive
their
right.
if
the
state
said
here
is
your
preliminary
hearing,
a
defendant
or
his
lawyer
could
say
“yes,
i
waive
my
right.”
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
if
they
were
offered.
the
only
difficulty
i
find
with
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
it
would
require
them
to
initiate
that
request
by
seeking
out
the
probable
cause
hearing.
i
think
if
there
is
an
offer
and
they
say
“i
waive
it,”
fine.
it
can
be
waived.
there
is
another
distinguishing
characteristic
between
lem
woon,
ocampo,
and
beck
and
this
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
cases
which
have
been
cited
by
the
state.
all
of
those
cases
sought
to
overturn
otherwise
valid
convictions.
we
do
not
seek
to
overturn
an
otherwise
valid
conviction.
we
do
not
say
that
a
man
cannot
have
a
fair
trial
without
a
preliminary
hearing.
what
we
say
is
that
he
cannot
be
fairly
deprived
of
his
liberty
without
a
preliminary
hearing.
and
that
distinction
runs
through
all
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
state
and
the
state
attorney
and
this
case.
there
is
no
bar.
the
state
has
raised
younger
versus
harris.
they
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
but
we’re
not
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
but
what
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
what
we’re
saying
is
that
if
a
person
is
convicted
and
never
has
a
preliminary
hearing
that
does
not
vitiate
the
conviction.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and
i
think
then
i
probably
ought
to
restate
my
position
and
say
a
person
cannot
be
deprived
of
his
liberty
for
any
length
of
time
beyond
whatever
that
the
court
deems
(inaudible)
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
we
can
see
the
person
can
be
deprived
of
his
liberty
at
that
initial
arrest,
yes.
but,
afterwards,
there
must
be
a
way
to
test
it.
so,
we’re
saying
that
the
taking
of
his
liberty
without
a
way
to
test
it
is
unfair.
the
question
is
how
long
may
that
liberty
be
taken.
i
think
that’s
really
what
your
honor
is
getting
to.
we
agree
that
the
liberty
can
be
taken.
we
don’t
seek
prior
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
certainly.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
but
in
florida,
already
we
have
a
period
from
5-8
days,
i
believe,
under
the
rules
and
we
think
that
even
is
too
long.
but
we
think
it
ought
to
be
framed
out
in
a
time
period.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
fifth
circuit
said
it
would
not
reach
the
question
and
so
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir,
4-7
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
for
us,
it
is,
your
honor.
i
should
point
out
that
the
florida
rule
has
now
changed
to
make
it
5-8
days.
it
was
4-7
when
the
fifth
circuit
decided
it.
the
amendment
to
the
rule
has
now
increased
the
time
that
the
state
attorney
has
in
which
to
file
an
information
and
obviate
the
preliminary
hearing.
so,
they
have
permitted
even
greater
tolerance
for
a
state
attorney
to
obviate
that
determination
of
probable
cause.
we
think
that
a
preliminary
hearing
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
we
think
that
the
question
of
time
is
a
valid
question
when
one
addresses
a
due
process
issue.
when
must
the
hearing
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
certainly,
i
would.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
sir.
and,
in
fact,
we
would
be
happy
with
an
affirmance,
yes.
we
think
that
the
preliminary
hearing
would
promote
the
efficient
administration
of
criminal
justice
because
what
it
does
is
offer
an
opportunity
for
both
sides
to
get
together
at
an
early
point
perhaps
to
enter
a
plea,
perhaps
to
have
a
release
on
bail
decision
made
once
the
facts
are
in.
and,
the
record
in
this
case
reflects
that
there
has
been
a
reduction
in
the
felony
court
case
load
in
florida
in
dade
county
of
20-25%,
once
preliminary
hearings
were
initiated
when
the
state
attorney
didn’t
file
information
as
a
direct
result
of
the
litigation
below
and
of
the
order
of
the
district
court
below
which
then
prompted
the
local
judges
to
setup
magistrate
hearings
unless
there
was
an
information
filed.
and
i
should
also
point
out,
i
think,
that
at
that
time,
the
attorney
general
of
florida
sought
to
be
a
plaintiff
in
the
case
and
sought
to
join
with
us
and
affect
preliminary
hearings
because
his
clients
and
judges
requested
that.
today,
he
argues
that
there
is
no
right
to
such
a
hearing.
the
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
ten
days
under
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
then
there
is
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
open-ended,
yes,
sir.
the
state
has
also
raised
the
question
of
younger
versus
harris
which,
in
some
ways,
runs
along
with
the
preiser
versus
rodriguez
issue.
and,
i
think
i
should
address
that
very
briefly.
both
the
district
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
agreed
that
younger
versus
harris
was
not
applicable
because
what
we
were
seeking
here
was
a
pretrial
procedural
right
and
no
interference
with
the
state
court
proceedings
at
all.
any
decision
which
would
be
made
will
be
made
by
state
judges.
there
was
great
respect
for
comity.
but
even
if
younger
versus
harris
had
some
application
in
this
case,
we
have
an
exception
to
it
because
there
is
a
reparable
injury,
the
taking
of
liberty
without
a
hearing,
and
there
is
absolutely
no
way
to
test
that
taking
of
liberty
in
the
florida
courts.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
believe
it
does,
because
the
state
law
is
clear.
the
case
would
be
dismissed.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
understand
that.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
is
true,
but
i
think
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
certainly,
there
is
a
procedural
remedy
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
which
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it’s
wholly
futile.
justice
frankfurter
wrote
that
due
process
is
compounded
of
history
in
fairness
and
reason,
and
our
position
is
that
history
in
fairness
and
reason
all
compel
to
conclusion
that
preliminary
hearings
for
a
person
incarcerated
in
custody,
deprived
of
his
liberty,
must
be
given
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
florida,
the
state
attorney
absolutely
controls
the
question
of
probable
cause.
if
he
files
an
information,
there
is
no
right
to
be
heard
on
the
question
of
probable
cause.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
was
not,
your
honor,
but
it
has
no
application
in
this
case.
it
has
no
application,
one,
because
we
have
never
sought
release
from
custody
in
the
district
court.
all
we
sought
was
a
pretrial
procedural
right.
but,
even
if
the
court
felt
that
preiser
did
have
an
application
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
may
still
have
arisen
your
honor,
because
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
custody
might
still
be
a
valid
question.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
is
true
that
this
was
a
pure
custody
case,
but
my
point
is
that
all
we’re
asking
is
the
district
court
to
compel
there
to
be
a
preliminary
hearing
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
sir,
never.
never
ask
for
release.
the
decision
on
release
would
have
to
be
that
made
by
the
magistrate.
if
he
determined
there
was
no
probable
cause,
then
he
would
release
the
person.
the
state
magistrate
would.
nevertheless
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
only
if
there
is
no
probable
cause,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
in
offering
the
alternative
to
the
state
and
saying
“this
is
the
sanction,”
whereas,
a
statement
saying
“release
him.”
but
that
would
assume,
of
course,
that
the
state
would
fail
to
abide
by
the
constitutional
decision.
i
don’t
think
we
can
make
that
assumption,
but
if
i
may
divest
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
was
not
and
let
me
add
one
other
thing
regarding
preiser,
it’s
that
even
if
preiser
has
application
in
this
case,
state
remedies
were
futile
and
preiser
makes
it
quite
clear
that
there’s
no
need
to
attempt
habeas
corpus
in
state
court
if
it
were
to
be
futile
and
it
is
in
florida.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and
if
it
should
be
habeas
corpus.
if
the
court
felt
that
this
was
properly
a
habeas
corpus
matter,
we
think
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir,
but
it’s
quite
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
you
do,
your
honor.
i
think
the
record
is
absolutely
clear
that
there
is
no
local
remedy
throughout
this
litigation.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir,
and
the
fifth
circuit
said
so.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
said
that,
in
florida,
once
an
information
is
filed,
it
is
quite
clear
there
is
no
way
to
test
the
termination
of
probable
cause.
and
the
fifth
circuit,
in
a
footnote,
i
think,
in
their
decision
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
futile,
absolutely
futile,
because
once
the
information
is
filed
under
florida
law
you
cannot
go
behind
it
to
determine
probable
cause.
state
ex
rel.
hardy
versus
blount
makes
it
quite
clear
and
the
florida
decisions,
for
a
long
period
of
time,
make
it
quite
clear
that
a
state
habeas
corpus
charge
will
not
inquire
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
he
suggested
it,
but
he
did
not
address
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
would
be
futile.
he
said
you
could
file
a
habeas
corpus
petition,
but
we
are
telling
the
court
that
if
you
did
file
one,
it
would
be
a
futile
act,
an
empty
act
and
the
record
is
quite
clear
on
that
point.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
he
has
been
convicted,
your
honor,
and
he
is
in
jail
in
belle
glade,
florida.
but,
we
do
not
see
any
mootness
problem
here,
if
that
is
what
the
court
is
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
is
a
class
action,
but
it
is
also
a
problem
of
the
low
visibility
of
the
criminal
process,
one
which
is
“capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review.”
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir,
exactly.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
at
the
time
this
suit
was
filed,
all
the
named
parties
suffered
this
exact
deprivation.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
because
at
the
time
the
class
action
was
maintained
originally
in
the
district
court,
he
was
a
member
of
the
class
and
so
he
had
standing
at
that
point
and
the
class
action
survives
him.
but,
i
hasten
to
add
that
this
is
“capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review.”
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
am
sorry.
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
bernie
case,
but
i
am
familiar
with
the
cases
that
talk
about
“capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review.”
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
point
is
that
this
issue
would
never
be
litigated
in
the
30
or
60
or
90
days
in
which
that
custody
is
deprived.
there
would
be
no
way
ever
to
successfully
litigate
the
issue
and
the
court,
if
it
felt,
that
this
was
not
a
“capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review”
case,
would
relegate
people
to
having
no
opportunity
to
raise
the
issue
at
all
because
the
florida
law
is
clear
and
the
only
way
to
maintain
such
an
action
would
be
as
a
class
action
and
pointing
out
the
“capable
of
repetition
yet
evading
review”
exception
to
mootness.
within
recent
--
i
should
back
up
and
point
out
that
even
if
a
preliminary
hearing
is
held
in
florida,
because
a
state
attorney
does
not
file
an
information,
the
state
attorney
can
overrule
the
discharge
at
that
preliminary
hearing.
if
the
magistrate
finds
out
probable
cause
and
the
state
attorney
is
unhappy
with
that
determination,
the
state
attorney
can
file
an
information
and
the
person
is
back
in
jail
again.
so,
i
hearken
back
to
my
original
statement
that
the
state
attorney
absolutely
controls
the
question
of
probable
cause.
within
recent
years,
this
court
has
held
that
before
a
person’s
welfare
check
may
be
taken,
before
their
wage
is
garnished,
before
their
driver’s
license
is
suspended,
there
must
be
a
prior
hearing.
this
case
presents
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
after
a
person’s
liberty
is
taken
there
is
a
right
to
a
subsequent
hearing.
and,
recently,
in
morrissey
versus
brewer
and
gagnon
versus
scarpelli
the
court
held
that
persons
whose
liberty
is
conditional,
people
on
parole,
on
probation
were
entitled
to
prompt
subsequent
preliminary
hearing.
once
it
was
determined
that
that
conditional
liberty
should
be
revoked.
we
are
talking
here
in
terms
of
absolute
liberty.
these
people
are
presumed
innocent
and
it
is
their
absolute
liberty
which
is
being
deprived.
the
right
to
which
we
seek
the
court
to
accord,
we
ask
the
court
to
accord
is
not
a
new
or
novel
right.
preliminary
hearings
are
ancient
institutions.
they
were
known
in
the
12th
century,
codified
in
the
16th
century,
used
in
the
colonies
before
and
after
the
revolution.
they
have
evolved
into
impartial
determinations
of
probable
cause
over
the
years
historically.
the
forerunner
of
the
preliminary
hearing,
which
we
asked
the
court
to
grant
today,
was
granted
in
the
case
of
aaron
burr
where
chief
justice
john
marshall
held
a
preliminary
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
probable
cause
to
hold
aaron
burr
on
a
charge
of
treason.
and,
the
extent
of
that
inquiry
was
whether
or
not
an
offense
had
been
committed
and
whether
or
not
burr
had
committed
it.
and
that
is
the
kind
of
preliminary
hearing
which
we
are
talking
about,
and
it
has
been
known
long
ago
in
england
and
here,
and
the
marshall
hearing
was
held
in
1807.
our
position
is
that
the
information
process
cannot
determine
probable
cause
for
two
reasons,
one,
because
it
provides
none
of
the
elements
of
a
due
process
hearing.
there
is
no
right
for
the
defendant
to
be
heard.
there
is
no
right
to
confront
and
cross-examine
witnesses.
there
is
not
right
to
present
evidence.
so,
it
is
solely
an
ex
parte
non-adversarial
hearing
and
that
is
not
consistent
with
due
process.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir,
on
fourth
amendment
probable
cause.
what
we
are
seeking
is
the
test
of
that
fourth
amendment
determination.
it’s
interesting,
i
think,
to
note
that
if
evidence
is
seized
upon
a
warrant
stating
probable
cause,
you
contest
that
determination
by
a
motion
to
suppress.
but
here
in
florida,
you
cannot
test
the
taking
of
liberty.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i’m
not
sure
about
most
states.
in
florida,
you
can
move
to
suppress
certainly
before
trial
if
the
evidence
has
been
illegally
seized.
it
seems
that
if
the
evidence
has
been
illegally
seized
or
if
the
taking
of
the
body
is
improper,
to
have
to
wait
for
trial
and
remain
in
jail
during
all
that
time
only
to
find
out
six
months
later
that
there
really
is
no
case
at
all,
so
there
is
no
useful
purpose
for
a
defendant
or
for
the
state.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
fourth
amendment
probable
cause.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
for
arrest,
yes,
sir.
and
we
are
seeking
to
test
that
probable
cause
in
a
due
process
hearing
subsequent
to
the
taking.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well,
the
basic
element
of
the
test
at
that
point,
of
course,
if
a
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it’s
the
ultimate
test,
but
it
is
of
no
benefit
to
a
person
who’s
been
incarcerated
for
60
days
and
shouldn’t
be
there
in
the
first
place.
and,
that’s
what
the
preliminary
hearing
is
all
about
and
that’s
what
the
preliminary
hearing
in
morrissey
versus
brewer
was
all
about.
certainly,
ultimately,
the
taker
might
decide
that
there
is
reason
to
revoke
parole
or
probation.
there
should
be
a
preliminary
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
parole
or
probation
is
revoked.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
it
is
not.
rule
5
uses
informations
only
in
misdemeanor
cases.
they
can
only
be
used
in
felony
cases
if
a
defendant
waives
his
right
to
indictment.
so,
rule
5
involves
only
misdemeanors.
to
that
extent,
it
is
similar
because
this
case
also
presents
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
misdemeanors
are
entitled
to
preliminary
hearings
if
they,
too,
are
in
custody.
but,
it
is
a
limited
comparison.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and
a
waiver?
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
think,
probably
at
the
commissioner
hearing,
the
first
appearance
hearing,
he
might
be
told
that.
i
am
not
quite
sure.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
sir.
there
is
no
requirement
that
he’d
be
told
that,
but
he
would
obviously
have
counsel
at
the
first
appearance
hearing
before
the
commissioner.
and,
seemingly,
his
counsel
would
inform
him
that
if
he
makes
a
decision
that
he
wants
to
waive
indictment
that
he
could
be
preceded
against
by
information.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and
in
felony
cases,
it
seems
since
they’re
going
to
be
determining
bail
and
other
issues,
at
least
the
practice
in
florida
and
the
southern
district
of
florida
to
appoint
counsel
at
that
time.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
that
is
a
fourth
amendment
ex
parte
determination
of
probable
cause.
there
are
deficiencies
in
it
because
of
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
what
we
have
there
is
a
very
practical
kind
of
consideration.
i
cannot
concede
that
there
is
absolutely
pure
fourth
amendment
probable
cause
there
because
neither
the
state
attorney
nor
the
arresting
officer
is
a
neutral
and
detached
person.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
there
is
--
we
are
willing
to
have
the
state
attorney
or
a
police
officer
decide
that
there’s
probable
cause
and
make
an
arrest.
otherwise,
what
we’d
be
asking
for
would
be
a
prior
to
arrest
determination
of
probable
cause
and
we
don’t
ask
that
because
that
would
be
a
ridiculous
request
to
invite
possible
defendants
in
to
see
if
they’re
going
to
be
arrested
sometime
in
the
future.
it
would
work.
so
obviously,
when
the
balancing
process
takes
place,
you
have
to
allow
the
arresting
officer
to
make
that
quasi
determination
of
probable
cause
or
the
state
attorney
perhaps,
making
a
similar
quasi
determination
of
probable
cause,
neither
are
neutral
and
detached.
what
we’re
seeking
is
to
test
that
determination.
and
so,
it
is
a
flexible
kind
of
think
we’re
asking
after
the
taking
of
liberty,
an
opportunity
to
test
that
determination
that
was
made.
and
that
is
a
fourteenth
amendment
request
that
we’re
making
and
i
think
it’s
interesting
to
note
that
the
state
attorney
is
not
neutral
and
detached
not
only
under
the
fourth
amendment
but
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
morrissey
versus
brewer,
the
court
talked
about
one
of
the
essential
elements
of
a
due
process
hearing
is
to
have
that
hearing
conducted
by
a
neutral
and
detached
person.
and,
we
submit
that
the
state
attorney,
the
chief
prosecuting
officer,
certainly
in
not
neutral
and
detached
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
of
course,
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire
and
chadwick
versus
city
of
tampa,
he’s
certainly
not
neutral
and
detached
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
those
were
the
words
in
morrissey
versus
brewer
and
we
respect
those
words.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
or
will
not
have
a
future
connection
with
the
case.
in
other
words,
at
the
time
he
makes
a
decision,
he
is
not
involved
in
the
case
before
or
after.
the
prosecuting
attorney
is
the
chief
prosecutor.
he
is
involved
in
the
case
afterwards.
there
is
no
way
that
he
can
be
said
to
be
neutral
and
detached.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
but
we
are
talking
about
the
head
of
the
office,
the
state
attorney,
and
everyone
working
under
him
are
assistant
states
attorneys
so
he’s
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
he
is
the
one
to
whom
responsibility
finally
resides
and
he
is
the
one
who
signs
the
information.
he
is
the
one
who
charges
probable
cause.
it’s
true,
an
assistant
may
have
made
the
initial
determination
which,
i
think,
perhaps
in
some
way
underscores
the
kind
of
procedure
that
we
have
here.
and
this
record,
at
page
49
of
the
appendix,
reflects
that
a
police
officer
comes
in,
talks
to
an
assistant
state
attorney
perhaps
a
year
or
two
out
of
law
school,
and
tells
him
what
he
thinks
is
the
problem
or
what
the
gravamen
of
the
charge
is.
and
then,
the
assistant
prepares
the
information.
he
passes
it
on
to
another
deputy
state
attorney
who
looks
it
over.
and,
finally,
the
chief
state
attorney
signs
it.
so,
you’ve
got
three
people
in
this
process,
all
whom
are
rubberstamping
with
the
original
decision
made
by
an
assistant
who’s
working
under
the
direction
of
the
state
attorney.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
sir.
i
do
not
think
it’s
much
different
and,
to
be
quite
frank
to
the
court
--
if
we
were
correct,
if
a
person
in
custody
upon
an
information
is
entitled
to
a
preliminary
hearing
then,
under
rule
5c,
a
person
who’s
in
custody
prior
to
trial
in
the
federal
system
would
also
be
entitled
to
that
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well,
he
would
have
no
right
to
be
indicted
because
it
would
have
to
be
a
misdemeanor,
and
he
could
be
informed
against
it.
those
information
would
be
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and
the
question
is,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
that
person
would
have
a
right
to
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
that
would
be
true
if
we
are
correct.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
believe
that
the
assistant
us
attorney
could
file
an
information
after
the
arrest
in
a
misdemeanor
case
and
then
there
would
be
no
preliminary
hearing
conducted
by
the
magistrate.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
under
the
federal
rule.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
without
warrants,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
there
would
be
a
distinction
to
that
extent
between
the
two
systems,
but
i
think
there’s
another
distinction
that
has
to
be
raised
and,
that
is,
that
we’re
talking
about
people
who
were
in
custody
prior
to
trial.
and
in
the
federal
system
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir,
but
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
there
needs
to
be
an
opportunity
to
test
whether
or
not
that
is
a
valid
arrest
and
not
keep
a
man,
unless
he’s
been
indicted,
awaiting
trial
for
60
or
90
days
only
to
find
out
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
hold
him
during
all
that
time.
that’s
what
we’re
getting
at
in
this
case
and
that’s
what
the
issue
that’s
presented
in
this
case
is.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
if
he
is
in
custody,
yes,
sir,
except
for
indictments.
this
case
does
not
involve
indictments
at
all.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
it
does
involve
arrests
on
a
warrant.
even
if
that
warrant
is
issued,
i
may
add,
by
a
judge.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and
of
course,
the
question
that
was
raised
regarding
misdemeanors
takes
us
to
our
misdemeanor
argument
which
is
that
in
florida
they
have
a
classification
which
totally
excludes
misdemeanors
from
the
possibility
of
ever
getting
a
preliminary
hearing,
even
if
the
state
attorney
was
willing
to
tolerate
one.
the
classification
imposed
by
the
rule
is
that
there
is
no
right
to
preliminary
hearing
unless
you
charge
with
a
felony
and,
of
course,
unless
the
state
attorney
does
not
file
an
information.
that
classification
affects
a
fundamental
right,
the
right
not
to
have
your
liberty
taken
without
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
and,
our
position
is
that
there
is
no
compelling
reason
advanced
by
the
state
for
that
classification.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed.
the
district
court
agreed.
in
fact,
the
state
has
really
not
advanced
a
compelling
reason
nor
even
a
rational
reason
for
that
distinction
between
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
we’re
saying
there
can
be
a
custodial
arrest
on
probable
cause
but
there
must
be
a
subsequent
review.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
court
of
appeals
said,
adapted
to
the
florida
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
four
to
seven
days.
frankly,
i
say
within
24
hours
if
the
sides
are
prepared.
a
man’s
liberty
should
not
be
taken
away
for
more
than
24
hours
without
opportunity
to
test
it.
and,
we
look
to
argersinger
for
support
because
in
argersinger
the
court
said
you
cannot
take
away
a
man’s
liberty
for
24
hours
without
counsel
and,
now,
we
are
talking
about
taking
away
his
liberty
for
24
hours
or
more
without
even
a
hearing.
so
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
line
has
to
be
drawn
somewhere.
the
court
of
appeals
said
4-7
days.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
can
see
that
because
as
a
practical
matter,
it
has
to
be
because
there
is
no
other
way
in
which
the
state
can
carry
out
its
obligation
to
arrest
people
who
possibly
have
committed
crimes.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir,
untested
probable
cause
but
probable
cause,
which,
we
concede
is
sufficient
for
the
arrest.
the
question,
i
believe,
that
your
honor
asked
me
was
how
long
afterwards
must
that
probable
cause
be
tested.
and,
my
response
was
with
argersinger
24
hours,
but
the
fifth
circuit
said
4-7
days.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
not
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
but
there’s
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
but
there’s
an
opportunity
to
be
heard.
that’s
a
fourth
amendment
probable
cause
determination,
ex
parte,
non-adversarial.
we
are
talking
about
a
due
process
opportunity
to
contest
or
test
that
fourth
amendment,
non-adversarial
determination
of
probable
cause
that’s
made.
and,
we
look
to
the
property
cases
which
say
that
before
your
property
is
taken
you
have
a
right
to
contest
that
taking.
and
all
we’re
saying
is
after
your
liberty
is
taken,
there
ought
to
be
a
right
to
contest
that
taking.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir,
if
the
state
court
had
permitted
us
to
test
probable
cause
through
habeas
corpus
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
sir,
we
would
not.
it
would
strictly
be
a
statement.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
florida
law
absolutely
forbids
an
inquiry
into
probable
cause
when
an
information
is
filed.
yes,
sir,
that
is
our
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
by
any
means,
because
information
stands
for
probable
cause.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that’s
right.
if
we
could
raise
it
successfully
in
florida
or
be
heard
on
it
in
florida,
we
wouldn’t
be
here.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well,
i
say
successfully
only
because
the
habeas
corpus
will
be
dismissed
in
florida
right
away
because
the
issue
that
would
be
raised
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
absolutely.
yes,
sir,
we
agree.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
when
you
say
do
you
need
it
automatic,
the
only
difficult
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
see.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
see
the
point
your
honor
makes.
i
may
back
off
a
little
bit
from
my
point
because
in
asserting
your
habeas
corpus
right,
it’s
incumbent
upon
you
to
test
probable
cause.
that
may
not
be
due
process.
i
really
--
this
case,
of
course,
was
raised
in
the
framework
of
the
existing
florida
law.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
not
a
hearing
on
everything,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
but
a
hearing,
certainly,
if
your
liberty
is
taken.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
motion
to
dismiss
which
the
state
spoke
about
can
be
traversed
merely
by
filing
a
traverse
by
the
state
attorney.
and
so,
the
state
attorney
can
dispute
whatever
statements
are
made
and
then
the
trial
judge
cannot
dismiss
the
case.
so,
again,
it’s
certainly
within
the
power
of
the
state
attorney
to
make
all
these
determinations
for
probable
cause.
that
motion
to
dismiss,
in
a
way,
i
suppose
is
really
illusory
because
all
the
state
need
do
is
not
acquiescent
it
and
it’s
an
unsuccessful
and
futile
remedy.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
think
that,
theoretically,
it
ought
to
be
the
state’s
obligation
to
provide
that
proceeding
in
which
a
person
can
test
whether
or
not
probable
cause
does
exist.
if
florida
had
a
different
procedure,
if
it
could
have
been
tested,
i
don’t
know
that
this
case
would
have
been
brought.
frankly,
we
just
had
not
fought
this
case
through
in
light
of
a
non-existent
situation.
the
situation
existed
and
that
was
what
we
were
addressing
ourselves
to.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
we
take
no
position
on
that
question.
we
do
not
say
that
after
an
indictment
there
must
be
an
adversarial
hearing.
in
order
to
say
that,
one
would
have
to
assume
that
the
historical
protections
which
this
court
has
found
in
the
indictment
procedures
no
longer
exist.
it
reminds
me
of
the
fact
that
john
peter
zenger,
when
he
was
sought
to
be
prosecuted
by
the
crown
twice,
they
sought
indictments
and
twice
they
failed.
and,
finally,
they
resorted
to
an
information
to
prosecute
him.
now,
if
the
protection
which
zenger
had
no
longer
exists,
then
perhaps
our
case
might
spawn
future
litigation.
but,
we
take
no
position
on
that
and
this
record
does
not
accord
the
court
an
opportunity
to
get
to
that
question
because
there
is
no
showing
that
indictments
do
not
really
protect
the
individual.
the
cases
cited
by
the
state,
hertado,
lem
woon,
ocampo,
beck
have
no
application
in
this
case.
those
cases
--
hertado,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
was
an
information
filed
after
a
preliminary
hearing.
so,
hertado
certainly
has
no
real
effect
on
this
case.
the
other
cases
talk
about
the
fact
that
there
is
no
need
for
a
preliminary
hearing
prior
to
the
issuance
of
an
information,
and
we
agree
with
that
position.
fine,
let
the
information
issue
but
after
the
information
issue
there
must
be
a
subsequent
determination
of
probable
cause.
there’s
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
might.
i
just
--
as
a
pure
due
process
matter,
we
think
it’s
incumbent
upon
the
state.
if
you
can
make
the
request
and
it
be
granted,
notwithstanding
the
filing
of
the
information,
that
would
certainly
lessen
our
argument
somewhat.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
approaches
the
question
really
of
waiver.
if
one
fails
to
assert
that
right
he
would,
in
effect,
have
been
waiving
his
right
and
i
think
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
certainly
don’t
think
that.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
think
the
people
would
want
an
inquiry
on
probable
cause.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
i
would
not
say
every
one
of
them.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and,
of
course,
they
could
waive
their
right.
if
the
state
said
here
is
your
preliminary
hearing,
a
defendant
or
his
lawyer
could
say
“yes,
i
waive
my
right.”
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
if
they
were
offered.
the
only
difficulty
i
find
with
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
it
would
require
them
to
initiate
that
request
by
seeking
out
the
probable
cause
hearing.
i
think
if
there
is
an
offer
and
they
say
“i
waive
it,”
fine.
it
can
be
waived.
there
is
another
distinguishing
characteristic
between
lem
woon,
ocampo,
and
beck
and
this
case
and
the
court
of
appeals
cases
which
have
been
cited
by
the
state.
all
of
those
cases
sought
to
overturn
otherwise
valid
convictions.
we
do
not
seek
to
overturn
an
otherwise
valid
conviction.
we
do
not
say
that
a
man
cannot
have
a
fair
trial
without
a
preliminary
hearing.
what
we
say
is
that
he
cannot
be
fairly
deprived
of
his
liberty
without
a
preliminary
hearing.
and
that
distinction
runs
through
all
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
state
and
the
state
attorney
and
this
case.
there
is
no
bar.
the
state
has
raised
younger
versus
harris.
they
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
but
we’re
not
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
but
what
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
what
we’re
saying
is
that
if
a
person
is
convicted
and
never
has
a
preliminary
hearing
that
does
not
vitiate
the
conviction.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and
i
think
then
i
probably
ought
to
restate
my
position
and
say
a
person
cannot
be
deprived
of
his
liberty
for
any
length
of
time
beyond
whatever
that
the
court
deems
(inaudible)
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
we
can
see
the
person
can
be
deprived
of
his
liberty
at
that
initial
arrest,
yes.
but,
afterwards,
there
must
be
a
way
to
test
it.
so,
we’re
saying
that
the
taking
of
his
liberty
without
a
way
to
test
it
is
unfair.
the
question
is
how
long
may
that
liberty
be
taken.
i
think
that’s
really
what
your
honor
is
getting
to.
we
agree
that
the
liberty
can
be
taken.
we
don’t
seek
prior
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
certainly.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
but
in
florida,
already
we
have
a
period
from
5-8
days,
i
believe,
under
the
rules
and
we
think
that
even
is
too
long.
but
we
think
it
ought
to
be
framed
out
in
a
time
period.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
fifth
circuit
said
it
would
not
reach
the
question
and
so
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir,
4-7
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
for
us,
it
is,
your
honor.
i
should
point
out
that
the
florida
rule
has
now
changed
to
make
it
5-8
days.
it
was
4-7
when
the
fifth
circuit
decided
it.
the
amendment
to
the
rule
has
now
increased
the
time
that
the
state
attorney
has
in
which
to
file
an
information
and
obviate
the
preliminary
hearing.
so,
they
have
permitted
even
greater
tolerance
for
a
state
attorney
to
obviate
that
determination
of
probable
cause.
we
think
that
a
preliminary
hearing
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
we
think
that
the
question
of
time
is
a
valid
question
when
one
addresses
a
due
process
issue.
when
must
the
hearing
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
certainly,
i
would.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
sir.
and,
in
fact,
we
would
be
happy
with
an
affirmance,
yes.
we
think
that
the
preliminary
hearing
would
promote
the
efficient
administration
of
criminal
justice
because
what
it
does
is
offer
an
opportunity
for
both
sides
to
get
together
at
an
early
point
perhaps
to
enter
a
plea,
perhaps
to
have
a
release
on
bail
decision
made
once
the
facts
are
in.
and,
the
record
in
this
case
reflects
that
there
has
been
a
reduction
in
the
felony
court
case
load
in
florida
in
dade
county
of
20-25%,
once
preliminary
hearings
were
initiated
when
the
state
attorney
didn’t
file
information
as
a
direct
result
of
the
litigation
below
and
of
the
order
of
the
district
court
below
which
then
prompted
the
local
judges
to
setup
magistrate
hearings
unless
there
was
an
information
filed.
and
i
should
also
point
out,
i
think,
that
at
that
time,
the
attorney
general
of
florida
sought
to
be
a
plaintiff
in
the
case
and
sought
to
join
with
us
and
affect
preliminary
hearings
because
his
clients
and
judges
requested
that.
today,
he
argues
that
there
is
no
right
to
such
a
hearing.
the
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
ten
days
under
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
then
there
is
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
open-ended,
yes,
sir.
the
state
has
also
raised
the
question
of
younger
versus
harris
which,
in
some
ways,
runs
along
with
the
preiser
versus
rodriguez
issue.
and,
i
think
i
should
address
that
very
briefly.
both
the
district
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
agreed
that
younger
versus
harris
was
not
applicable
because
what
we
were
seeking
here
was
a
pretrial
procedural
right
and
no
interference
with
the
state
court
proceedings
at
all.
any
decision
which
would
be
made
will
be
made
by
state
judges.
there
was
great
respect
for
comity.
but
even
if
younger
versus
harris
had
some
application
in
this
case,
we
have
an
exception
to
it
because
there
is
a
reparable
injury,
the
taking
of
liberty
without
a
hearing,
and
there
is
absolutely
no
way
to
test
that
taking
of
liberty
in
the
florida
courts.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
believe
it
does,
because
the
state
law
is
clear.
the
case
would
be
dismissed.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
understand
that.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
is
true,
but
i
think
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
certainly,
there
is
a
procedural
remedy
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
which
--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it’s
wholly
futile.
justice
frankfurter
wrote
that
due
process
is
compounded
of
history
in
fairness
and
reason,
and
our
position
is
that
history
