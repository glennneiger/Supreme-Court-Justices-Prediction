mr.
leonard
mellon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
the
assistant
state
attorney
in
florida
and
i
represent
the
petitioner
here,
richard
e.
gerstein
the
state
attorney
in
the
judicial
circuit
of
florida
for
dade
county.
petitioner
was
the
appellant
below
and
one
of
the
defendants
at
trial
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
florida.
we
are
here
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
august
15th,
1973
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
in
which,
that
court
held
in
affirming
the
united
states
district
court
from
the
southern
district
of
florida
that
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
mandated
that
preliminary
hearings
be
given
for
all
persons
being
held
in
custody
even
in
instances
where
they
are
charged
by
an
information
filed
by
a
state
attorney
in
which
he
has
certified
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
hold
those
persons
in
custody
pending
trial.
the
respondents,
at
the
time
of
the
initiation
of
this
litigation
where
defendants,
then
in
custody
in
the
dade
county
jail,
charged
with
various
crimes:
felonies
and
misdemeanors,
charged
by
information
or
information
which
had
there
before
had
been
filed
by
the
dade
county
state
attorney,
the
petitioner
here.
in
the
class
actions,
they
asked
that
the
district
court
declare
and
mandatorily
compel
the
dade
county
circuit
court
to
grant
them
a
preliminary
hearing
on
the
charges
then
pending
against
them.
the
united
states
district
court,
in
its
ruling,
held
among
other
things
that
these
defendants
were
entitled
under
the
constitution,
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment,
to
a
preliminary
hearing
even
though
they
had
been
charged
in
an
information
in
which
the
state
attorney
had
certified
the
issue
of
probable
cause.
we
are
here
confronted
with
that
question.
do
persons
in
state
custody,
charged
under
information
in
which
there
has
been
a
certification
as
to
probable
cause
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
that
is
the
state
attorney,
do
they
have
a
right
to
a
preliminary
hearing
before
a
magistrate
on
that
question
of
probable
cause.
throughout
this
litigation,
the
petitioner
has
relied
on
a
line
of
cases
by
this
court
beginning
with
ker
versus
california
in
which
this
court
held
that
a
man
need
not
be
charged
by
a
grand
jury
indictment
but
can,
in
fact,
be
charged
by
information.
lem
woon
versus
oregon
has
been
argued
throughout
this
litigation.
this
court
has
held
that
no
prior
probable
cause
hearing
is
necessary
prior
to
the
making
of
an
arrest.
we
relied
especially
on
this
court’s
language
in
ocampo
versus
united
states
in
234
united
states.
there,
it
was
held
that
the
function
of
determining
probable
cause
is
only
quasi-judicial
and,
therefore,
that
function
need
not
be
confided
to
a
strictly
judicial
officer
or
tribunal.
this
court,
in
recent
years,
in
its
decision
in
shadwick
versus
tampa,
for
example,
held
that
a
magistrate
must
meet
two
tests.
first,
that
he’d
be
neutral
and
detached
and
the
second
that
he’d
be
capable
of
determining
probable
cause.
when
this
court
held
in
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire
that
the
very
attorney
general
who
would
act
as
a
magistrate
in
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant,
that
attorney
general
who
had
been
the
chief
investigator
in
the
case
leading
up
to
the
application
for
a
search
warrant
and
who
would
be
the
chief
prosecutor
did
not
have
the
degree
of
neutrality
and
detachment
necessary
in
that
instance.
we
submit
that
we
are
not
here
confronted
with
a
similar
situation
to
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire.
a
state
attorney
in
florida
and
the
state
attorney
in
this
instance,
the
petitioner,
in
his
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
there
are
sufficient
facts
to
file
an
information
has
a
degree
of
neutrality
and
certainly
has
a
degree
of
detachment
for
he
does
not
make
the
case.
the
case
is
brought
to
him
by
a
law
enforcement
agency.
he
sits,
in
effect,
at
the
juncture
in
the
proceeding
in
a
quasi-judicial
capacity.
he
meets
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
it
occurs
both
ways,
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
the
majority
of
cases
in
our
jurisdiction
in
florida,
in
dade
county,
are
warrantless
arrests
where
the
officer
comes
upon
the
scene
and
makes
an
arrest
on
probable
cause.
in
that
case,
the
information
is
filed
subsequent
to
the
arrest.
mr.
leonard
mellon
is
in
custody
that
is
right.
in
the
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes,
your
honor.
under
the
present
rules
of
criminal
procedure
in
florida,
which
were
amended
effective
march
1
of
this
year,
he
must
file
an
information
within
96
hours
after
the
initial
appearance.
and,
the
initial
appearance
is
held
that
conforms
to
your
rule,
rule
5,
must
be
held
within
24
hours
after
the
arrest.
but,
the
majority
of
cases
are
of
a
warrantless
variety.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
instances
where
a
police
officer
comes
to
the
state
attorney’s
office,
testifies
to
the
state
attorney
or
his
assistant
as
to
the
nature
of
his
case
and,
thereafter,
a
warrant,
a
habeas
or
warrant
is
issued
when
an
information
is
filed.
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes,
the
habeas
issues
in
florida,
under
the
florida
rules,
unless
the
man
is
already
in
custody
or
unless
he
is
out
on
bond.
in
those
two
instances,
the
habeas
will
not
issue.
however,
if
he
is
at
large
and
has
not
been
arrested
at
a
prior
time,
a
habeas
will
issue.
mr.
leonard
mellon
no,
your
honor,
the
habeas
is
issued
by
the
clerk
acting
at
the
court’s
behest.
mr.
leonard
mellon
the
prosecutor
indicates
that
if
the
rule
provides
that
the
habeas
shall
issue
at
the
time
the
information
was
filed
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
unless
the
prosecutor
request
that
it
be
issued
at
some
subsequent
time.
mr.
leonard
mellon
the
only
mandatory
requirement
in
florida
is
in
the
area
of
capital
offenses
that
a
grand
jury
indictment
must
hand
it
up.
otherwise,
all
crimes
are
prosecutable
by
information.
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes,
other
crimes.
very
many
crimes
are
prosecuted
by
indictment.
mr.
leonard
mellon
the
grand
jury,
generally,
makes
that
determination.
and
the
state
attorney,
quite
often,
will
bring
matters
before
the
grand
jury,
matters
dealing
with
public
corruption
for
example,
matters
which,
historically,
have
been
brought
before
a
grand
jury.
florida
has
a
unique
law,
sunshine
law,
which
requires
all
executive
agencies
to
conduct
their
business
in
the
sunshine
effect
and
that
there
not
be
executive
sessions.
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes,
sir.
indeed
they
can.
mr.
leonard
mellon
simply
by
directing
the
prosecutor
to
bring
that
matter
before
them.
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes,
your
honor.
the
prosecutor
must
certify,
in
his
information,
that
he
has
had
sworn
testimony
taken
and
they
are,
in
fact,
sworn.
mr.
leonard
mellon
where
is
that
in
the
statute?
mr.
leonard
mellon
your
honor,
counsel
for
amicus
will—it’s
set
out
in
the
four
rules
of
criminal
procedure
that
the
matter
must
be
based
on
the
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
at
that
juncture,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
mellon
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
mellon
that
is
correct.
mr.
leonard
mellon
it’s
a
statewide
question,
your
honor,
since
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
problem
about
--
dade
county
has
a
unique
magistrate
system
which
arose
during
the
time
this
case
was
pending
on
appeal.
florida
provides,
on
a
statewide
basis,
under
its
rules
for
preliminary
hearings
now
but
its
ramifications
are
clearly
statewide.
mr.
leonard
mellon
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
mellon
both
with
felonies
and
with
misdemeanors.
mr.
leonard
mellon
in
dade
county,
in
instances
where
information
are
filed
after
an
officer
has
com
to
the
state
attorney’s
office
and
has
exposed
the
case
to
the
state
attorney.
in
those
instances,
a
sworn
testimony
is
taken
in
each
instance.
mr.
leonard
mellon
from
the
officer
and
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
not
always
with
a
court
reporter
but
he’d
sworn
when
an
officer
comes
into
the
office.
there
are
certain
policies
set
out
in
the
office
that
determine
as
to
when
court
reporters
will
be
advised.
but,
the
officer
and/or
any
other
witnesses
who
were
there
are
sworn
in
those
instances.
mr.
leonard
mellon
your
honor,
under
the
revised
rule
which
was
effective
on
march
1st
of
this
month,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
imposed
on
state
attorneys
in
florida
an
even
higher
burden
in
the
per
curiam
opinion
which
accompanied
the
revised
rule.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
that
prosecutors
now
have
96
hours
after
the
first
appearance
hearing
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
an
information
shall
be
filed
against
that
person
in
custody.
now,
in
making
that
determination,
they
must
not
only
look
to
see
if
there’d
be
probable
cause.
they
must
go
beyond
it
and
establish
if
there
is
proof
beyond
to
the
exclusion
of
reasonable
doubt.
and
if
there’d
not
be
proof
beyond
to
the
exclusion
of
reasonable
doubt,
then
the
defendant
should
be
discharged.
that
is
the
implication
in
the
per
curiam
opinion
which
accompanied
the
release
of
the
new
rule
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
leonard
mellon
your
honor,
in
the
appendix
to
the
respondent’s
brief,
the
amended
rule
appears
with
its
accompanying
opinion.
it’s
the
last
exhibit
in
the
respondent’s
appendix.
it
was
not,
heretofore,
brought
to
this
court’s
attention
and
the
petitioner
since
the
amended
rule
in
the
opinion
in
which
it
was
released
occurred
in
early
february.
mr.
leonard
mellon
that
is
not
at
issue
here.
mr.
leonard
mellon
pretrial
detention
of
a
man
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
no,
your
honor.
we’re
up
here
on
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
mellon
no,
your
honor,
it
was
brought
as
a
class
action
in
seeking
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes.
mr.
leonard
mellon
that
is
right,
your
honor.
that
is
the
salient
question
here.
mr.
leonard
mellon
heretofore,
at
the
time
the
suit
was
instituted,
there
was
--
habeas
corpus
was
a
possible
remedy.
at
any
time
after
custody
the
question,
a
lack
of
evidence
at
all
to
hold
a
person.
florida,
by
statute,
had
a
30-day
period
which
allowed
a
state
attorney
at
that
time
in
which
to
file
an
information.
mr.
leonard
mellon
we
do
not
reach
that
question
here,
your
honor,
not
in
the
question
in
which
it
came
up
from
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
leonard
mellon
that
was
argued
below,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
a
possibility
that
they
could
have
filed
for
habeas
corpus.
questioning
the
--
however,
the
30-day
statute
that
had
existed
which
has
now
been
repealed
in
florida
had
provided
he
must
wait
that
period
of
time
before
he
could
question
it,
before
the
judge
who
was
to
try
him.
however,
it’s
always
been
felt
in
this
case,
certainly
by
the
petitioner,
that
the
other
type
of
habeas
corpus
which
would
lie
where
there
is
the
absence
of
any
evidence
to
hold
that
man
could
have
been
petitioned
for.
mr.
leonard
mellon
i
think
that
federal
habeas
corpus
was
available
in
this
suit.
mr.
leonard
mellon
under
the
old
procedure
in
florida,
yes.
mr.
leonard
mellon
habeas
corpus
is
still
available
in
florida.
however,
the
supreme
court
decided
that
the
speediest
way,
i
think,
was
by
this
amended
rule
which
became
effective
on
march
1.
if
after
the
elapse,
in
effect,
it
is
96
days
plus
another
24
hours
for
there’s
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
excuse
me,
your
honor,
96
hours
plus
the
additional
24
hours
in
which
the
man
must
be
brought
in
for
a
first
appearance
hearing.
if
after
the
elapse
of
that
time,
an
information
has
not
been
filed,
the
supreme
court
has
directed
in
its
rule
that
the
man
be
released
in
his
own
recognizance.
mr.
leonard
mellon
his
remedy
there
is
to
move
by
a
motion
to
dismiss,
your
honor.
at
the
time
of
arraignment,
the
information
is
read
to
him
unless
he
waives
the
reading.
he
can,
at
that
time,
attack
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
hold
him.
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
mellon
the
defendant
must
be
brought
before
a
magistrate
within
24
hours
after
his
arrest.
mr.
leonard
mellon
if
he
is
advised
of
his
constitutional
rights
at
that
time,
his
right
to
bail.
questions
of
sanity
are
quite
often
raised
at
that
first
appearance
hearing.
he
is,
thereafter
--
he
is
advised
generally
of
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
leonard
mellon
not
at
that
first
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
it’s
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
that
is
correct,
and
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
mellon
dade
county
has
a
unique,
i
looked
earlier,
has
a
system
of
committing
magistrates
which
sit
regularly
and
which
afford
preliminary
hearings
in
an
almost
overwhelming
majority
of
cases.
the
courts
were
created,
as
i
say,
at
the
time
this
case
was
making
its
way
up
through
the
appellate
structure.
however,
in
fact,
in
dade
county
at
the
first
appearance
hearing,
the
man
is
advised
of
his
constitutional
rights
and,
thereafter,
told
the
aid
of
his
preliminary
hearing
which
is
a
matter
of
course
thing.
however,
candor
compels
me
to
indicate
to
this
court
that
the
system
of
magistrates
courts
in
dade
county
are
unique
and,
though
other
circuits
in
florida
offer
preliminary
hearings
on
a
regular
basis,
dade
county
is
the
unique
one
that
does
it
as
a
matter
of
course.
mr.
leonard
mellon
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
mellon
unless
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes,
and
that
rule
was
modeled
after
your
rule
5.
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes,
that
is
it,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
mellon
right
mr.
leonard
mellon
that
is
as
succinctly
as
it
could
be
put,
your
honor.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
leonard
mellon
i
am
not
clear,
your
honor.
i
am
sure
that
counsel
for
the
respondent
could
supply
the
court
with
that
information.
we’ve
always
submitted
in
florida.
we
also
argued
beck
versus
washington
in
which
this
court
also
alluded
to
the
fact
that
in
the
state
of
washington,
for
almost
50
years,
beck
was
decided
in
1962,
that
in
washington
for
almost
50
years
prosecutions
were
had
not
by
grand
jury
indictment
but
by
information
without
determinations
as
to
probable
cause.
now,
clearly,
the
language
of
this
court
seemed
to
lieu
to
prior
determinations.
however,
we’ve
argued
and
we
argue
here
that
the
state
of
washington
law
at
that
time
and
at
the
present
time
is
such
that
there
are
no
probable
cause
hearings
given
neither
prior
to
the
time
of
an
arrest
or
after
an
arrest
in
the
state
of
washington.a
nd,
that
the
prosecutor
in
washington
proceeds
as
he
does
in
florida
and
as
he
does
in
several
other
states
which
we
allude
to
in
our
brief,
wyoming,
montana,
iowa,
arkansas,
connecticut
and
that
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut,
in
discussing
this
matter,
in
an
early
case
has
said
the
state
attorney
when
proceeding
by
information
is
vested
with
the
common
law
power
of
attorney
general.
and
that
they
cited
hertado
in
that
case
and
ocampo,
and
held
that
the
state
attorney
really,
in
effect,
acts
as
a
one-man
grand
jury
and
that’s
what
we
submit
to
this
court.
the
state
attorney
in
florida
is
capable
of
acting
in
a
detached
neutral
manner
so
that
his
finding,
his
certification
for
probable
cause
should
be
entitled
to
as
much
weight
certainly
as
a
finding
of
probable
cause
by
a
grand
jury.
we
submit
to
this
court,
respectfully,
that
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
should
thereupon
be
reversed.
mr.
leonard
mellon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
the
assistant
state
attorney
in
florida
and
i
represent
the
petitioner
here,
richard
e.
gerstein
the
state
attorney
in
the
judicial
circuit
of
florida
for
dade
county.
petitioner
was
the
appellant
below
and
one
of
the
defendants
at
trial
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
florida.
we
are
here
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
august
15th,
1973
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
in
which,
that
court
held
in
affirming
the
united
states
district
court
from
the
southern
district
of
florida
that
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
mandated
that
preliminary
hearings
be
given
for
all
persons
being
held
in
custody
even
in
instances
where
they
are
charged
by
an
information
filed
by
a
state
attorney
in
which
he
has
certified
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
hold
those
persons
in
custody
pending
trial.
the
respondents,
at
the
time
of
the
initiation
of
this
litigation
where
defendants,
then
in
custody
in
the
dade
county
jail,
charged
with
various
crimes:
felonies
and
misdemeanors,
charged
by
information
or
information
which
had
there
before
had
been
filed
by
the
dade
county
state
attorney,
the
petitioner
here.
in
the
class
actions,
they
asked
that
the
district
court
declare
and
mandatorily
compel
the
dade
county
circuit
court
to
grant
them
a
preliminary
hearing
on
the
charges
then
pending
against
them.
the
united
states
district
court,
in
its
ruling,
held
among
other
things
that
these
defendants
were
entitled
under
the
constitution,
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
fourteenth
amendment,
to
a
preliminary
hearing
even
though
they
had
been
charged
in
an
information
in
which
the
state
attorney
had
certified
the
issue
of
probable
cause.
we
are
here
confronted
with
that
question.
do
persons
in
state
custody,
charged
under
information
in
which
there
has
been
a
certification
as
to
probable
cause
by
the
prosecuting
attorney
that
is
the
state
attorney,
do
they
have
a
right
to
a
preliminary
hearing
before
a
magistrate
on
that
question
of
probable
cause.
throughout
this
litigation,
the
petitioner
has
relied
on
a
line
of
cases
by
this
court
beginning
with
ker
versus
california
in
which
this
court
held
that
a
man
need
not
be
charged
by
a
grand
jury
indictment
but
can,
in
fact,
be
charged
by
information.
lem
woon
versus
oregon
has
been
argued
throughout
this
litigation.
this
court
has
held
that
no
prior
probable
cause
hearing
is
necessary
prior
to
the
making
of
an
arrest.
we
relied
especially
on
this
court’s
language
in
ocampo
versus
united
states
in
234
united
states.
there,
it
was
held
that
the
function
of
determining
probable
cause
is
only
quasi-judicial
and,
therefore,
that
function
need
not
be
confided
to
a
strictly
judicial
officer
or
tribunal.
this
court,
in
recent
years,
in
its
decision
in
shadwick
versus
tampa,
for
example,
held
that
a
magistrate
must
meet
two
tests.
first,
that
he’d
be
neutral
and
detached
and
the
second
that
he’d
be
capable
of
determining
probable
cause.
when
this
court
held
in
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire
that
the
very
attorney
general
who
would
act
as
a
magistrate
in
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant,
that
attorney
general
who
had
been
the
chief
investigator
in
the
case
leading
up
to
the
application
for
a
search
warrant
and
who
would
be
the
chief
prosecutor
did
not
have
the
degree
of
neutrality
and
detachment
necessary
in
that
instance.
we
submit
that
we
are
not
here
confronted
with
a
similar
situation
to
coolidge
versus
new
hampshire.
a
state
attorney
in
florida
and
the
state
attorney
in
this
instance,
the
petitioner,
in
his
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
there
are
sufficient
facts
to
file
an
information
has
a
degree
of
neutrality
and
certainly
has
a
degree
of
detachment
for
he
does
not
make
the
case.
the
case
is
brought
to
him
by
a
law
enforcement
agency.
he
sits,
in
effect,
at
the
juncture
in
the
proceeding
in
a
quasi-judicial
capacity.
he
meets
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
it
occurs
both
ways,
mr.
justice
stewart.
in
the
majority
of
cases
in
our
jurisdiction
in
florida,
in
dade
county,
are
warrantless
arrests
where
the
officer
comes
upon
the
scene
and
makes
an
arrest
on
probable
cause.
in
that
case,
the
information
is
filed
subsequent
to
the
arrest.
mr.
leonard
mellon
is
in
custody
that
is
right.
in
the
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes,
your
honor.
under
the
present
rules
of
criminal
procedure
in
florida,
which
were
amended
effective
march
1
of
this
year,
he
must
file
an
information
within
96
hours
after
the
initial
appearance.
and,
the
initial
appearance
is
held
that
conforms
to
your
rule,
rule
5,
must
be
held
within
24
hours
after
the
arrest.
but,
the
majority
of
cases
are
of
a
warrantless
variety.
on
the
other
hand,
there
are
instances
where
a
police
officer
comes
to
the
state
attorney’s
office,
testifies
to
the
state
attorney
or
his
assistant
as
to
the
nature
of
his
case
and,
thereafter,
a
warrant,
a
habeas
or
warrant
is
issued
when
an
information
is
filed.
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes,
the
habeas
issues
in
florida,
under
the
florida
rules,
unless
the
man
is
already
in
custody
or
unless
he
is
out
on
bond.
in
those
two
instances,
the
habeas
will
not
issue.
however,
if
he
is
at
large
and
has
not
been
arrested
at
a
prior
time,
a
habeas
will
issue.
mr.
leonard
mellon
no,
your
honor,
the
habeas
is
issued
by
the
clerk
acting
at
the
court’s
behest.
mr.
leonard
mellon
the
prosecutor
indicates
that
if
the
rule
provides
that
the
habeas
shall
issue
at
the
time
the
information
was
filed
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
unless
the
prosecutor
request
that
it
be
issued
at
some
subsequent
time.
mr.
leonard
mellon
the
only
mandatory
requirement
in
florida
is
in
the
area
of
capital
offenses
that
a
grand
jury
indictment
must
hand
it
up.
otherwise,
all
crimes
are
prosecutable
by
information.
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes,
other
crimes.
very
many
crimes
are
prosecuted
by
indictment.
mr.
leonard
mellon
the
grand
jury,
generally,
makes
that
determination.
and
the
state
attorney,
quite
often,
will
bring
matters
before
the
grand
jury,
matters
dealing
with
public
corruption
for
example,
matters
which,
historically,
have
been
brought
before
a
grand
jury.
florida
has
a
unique
law,
sunshine
law,
which
requires
all
executive
agencies
to
conduct
their
business
in
the
sunshine
effect
and
that
there
not
be
executive
sessions.
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes,
sir.
indeed
they
can.
mr.
leonard
mellon
simply
by
directing
the
prosecutor
to
bring
that
matter
before
them.
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes,
your
honor.
the
prosecutor
must
certify,
in
his
information,
that
he
has
had
sworn
testimony
taken
and
they
are,
in
fact,
sworn.
mr.
leonard
mellon
where
is
that
in
the
statute?
mr.
leonard
mellon
your
honor,
counsel
for
amicus
will—it’s
set
out
in
the
four
rules
of
criminal
procedure
that
the
matter
must
be
based
on
the
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
at
that
juncture,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
mellon
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
mellon
that
is
correct.
mr.
leonard
mellon
it’s
a
statewide
question,
your
honor,
since
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
problem
about
--
dade
county
has
a
unique
magistrate
system
which
arose
during
the
time
this
case
was
pending
on
appeal.
florida
provides,
on
a
statewide
basis,
under
its
rules
for
preliminary
hearings
now
but
its
ramifications
are
clearly
statewide.
mr.
leonard
mellon
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
mellon
both
with
felonies
and
with
misdemeanors.
mr.
leonard
mellon
in
dade
county,
in
instances
where
information
are
filed
after
an
officer
has
com
to
the
state
attorney’s
office
and
has
exposed
the
case
to
the
state
attorney.
in
those
instances,
a
sworn
testimony
is
taken
in
each
instance.
mr.
leonard
mellon
from
the
officer
and
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
not
always
with
a
court
reporter
but
he’d
sworn
when
an
officer
comes
into
the
office.
there
are
certain
policies
set
out
in
the
office
that
determine
as
to
when
court
reporters
will
be
advised.
but,
the
officer
and/or
any
other
witnesses
who
were
there
are
sworn
in
those
instances.
mr.
leonard
mellon
your
honor,
under
the
revised
rule
which
was
effective
on
march
1st
of
this
month,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
imposed
on
state
attorneys
in
florida
an
even
higher
burden
in
the
per
curiam
opinion
which
accompanied
the
revised
rule.
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
that
prosecutors
now
have
96
hours
after
the
first
appearance
hearing
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
an
information
shall
be
filed
against
that
person
in
custody.
now,
in
making
that
determination,
they
must
not
only
look
to
see
if
there’d
be
probable
cause.
they
must
go
beyond
it
and
establish
if
there
is
proof
beyond
to
the
exclusion
of
reasonable
doubt.
and
if
there’d
not
be
proof
beyond
to
the
exclusion
of
reasonable
doubt,
then
the
defendant
should
be
discharged.
that
is
the
implication
in
the
per
curiam
opinion
which
accompanied
the
release
of
the
new
rule
of
criminal
procedure.
mr.
leonard
mellon
your
honor,
in
the
appendix
to
the
respondent’s
brief,
the
amended
rule
appears
with
its
accompanying
opinion.
it’s
the
last
exhibit
in
the
respondent’s
appendix.
it
was
not,
heretofore,
brought
to
this
court’s
attention
and
the
petitioner
since
the
amended
rule
in
the
opinion
in
which
it
was
released
occurred
in
early
february.
mr.
leonard
mellon
that
is
not
at
issue
here.
mr.
leonard
mellon
pretrial
detention
of
a
man
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
no,
your
honor.
we’re
up
here
on
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
mellon
no,
your
honor,
it
was
brought
as
a
class
action
in
seeking
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes.
mr.
leonard
mellon
that
is
right,
your
honor.
that
is
the
salient
question
here.
mr.
leonard
mellon
heretofore,
at
the
time
the
suit
was
instituted,
there
was
--
habeas
corpus
was
a
possible
remedy.
at
any
time
after
custody
the
question,
a
lack
of
evidence
at
all
to
hold
a
person.
florida,
by
statute,
had
a
30-day
period
which
allowed
a
state
attorney
at
that
time
in
which
to
file
an
information.
mr.
leonard
mellon
we
do
not
reach
that
question
here,
your
honor,
not
in
the
question
in
which
it
came
up
from
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
leonard
mellon
that
was
argued
below,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
a
possibility
that
they
could
have
filed
for
habeas
corpus.
questioning
the
--
however,
the
30-day
statute
that
had
existed
which
has
now
been
repealed
in
florida
had
provided
he
must
wait
that
period
of
time
before
he
could
question
it,
before
the
judge
who
was
to
try
him.
however,
it’s
always
been
felt
in
this
case,
certainly
by
the
petitioner,
that
the
other
type
of
habeas
corpus
which
would
lie
where
there
is
the
absence
of
any
evidence
to
hold
that
man
could
have
been
petitioned
for.
mr.
leonard
mellon
i
think
that
federal
habeas
corpus
was
available
in
this
suit.
mr.
leonard
mellon
under
the
old
procedure
in
florida,
yes.
mr.
leonard
mellon
habeas
corpus
is
still
available
in
florida.
however,
the
supreme
court
decided
that
the
speediest
way,
i
think,
was
by
this
amended
rule
which
became
effective
on
march
1.
if
after
the
elapse,
in
effect,
it
is
96
days
plus
another
24
hours
for
there’s
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
excuse
me,
your
honor,
96
hours
plus
the
additional
24
hours
in
which
the
man
must
be
brought
in
for
a
first
appearance
hearing.
if
after
the
elapse
of
that
time,
an
information
has
not
been
filed,
the
supreme
court
has
directed
in
its
rule
that
the
man
be
released
in
his
own
recognizance.
mr.
leonard
mellon
his
remedy
there
is
to
move
by
a
motion
to
dismiss,
your
honor.
at
the
time
of
arraignment,
the
information
is
read
to
him
unless
he
waives
the
reading.
he
can,
at
that
time,
attack
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
to
hold
him.
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
mellon
the
defendant
must
be
brought
before
a
magistrate
within
24
hours
after
his
arrest.
mr.
leonard
mellon
if
he
is
advised
of
his
constitutional
rights
at
that
time,
his
right
to
bail.
questions
of
sanity
are
quite
often
raised
at
that
first
appearance
hearing.
he
is,
thereafter
--
he
is
advised
generally
of
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
leonard
mellon
not
at
that
first
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
it’s
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
that
is
correct,
and
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
mellon
dade
county
has
a
unique,
i
looked
earlier,
has
a
system
of
committing
magistrates
which
sit
regularly
and
which
afford
preliminary
hearings
in
an
almost
overwhelming
majority
of
cases.
the
courts
were
created,
as
i
say,
at
the
time
this
case
was
making
its
way
up
through
the
appellate
structure.
however,
in
fact,
in
dade
county
at
the
first
appearance
hearing,
the
man
is
advised
of
his
constitutional
rights
and,
thereafter,
told
the
aid
of
his
preliminary
hearing
which
is
a
matter
of
course
thing.
however,
candor
compels
me
to
indicate
to
this
court
that
the
system
of
magistrates
courts
in
dade
county
are
unique
and,
though
other
circuits
in
florida
offer
preliminary
hearings
on
a
regular
basis,
dade
county
is
the
unique
one
that
does
it
as
a
matter
of
course.
mr.
leonard
mellon
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
mellon
unless
--
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes,
and
that
rule
was
modeled
after
your
rule
5.
mr.
leonard
mellon
yes,
that
is
it,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
mellon
right
mr.
leonard
mellon
that
is
as
succinctly
as
it
could
be
put,
your
honor.
yes,
it
is.
mr.
leonard
mellon
i
am
not
clear,
your
honor.
i
am
sure
that
counsel
for
the
respondent
could
supply
the
court
with
that
information.
we’ve
always
submitted
in
florida.
we
also
argued
beck
versus
washington
in
which
this
court
also
alluded
to
the
fact
that
in
the
state
of
washington,
for
almost
50
years,
beck
was
decided
in
1962,
that
in
washington
for
almost
50
years
prosecutions
were
had
not
by
grand
jury
indictment
but
by
information
without
determinations
as
to
probable
cause.
now,
clearly,
the
language
of
this
court
seemed
to
lieu
to
prior
determinations.
however,
we’ve
argued
and
we
argue
here
that
the
state
of
washington
law
at
that
time
and
at
the
present
time
is
such
that
there
are
no
probable
cause
hearings
given
neither
prior
to
the
time
of
an
arrest
or
after
an
arrest
in
the
state
of
washington.a
nd,
that
the
prosecutor
in
washington
proceeds
as
he
does
in
florida
and
as
he
does
in
several
other
states
which
we
allude
to
in
our
brief,
wyoming,
montana,
iowa,
arkansas,
connecticut
and
that
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut,
in
discussing
this
matter,
in
an
early
case
has
said
the
state
attorney
when
proceeding
by
information
is
vested
with
the
common
law
power
of
attorney
general.
and
that
they
cited
hertado
in
that
case
and
ocampo,
and
held
that
the
state
attorney
really,
in
effect,
acts
as
a
one-man
grand
jury
and
that’s
what
we
submit
to
this
court.
the
state
attorney
in
florida
is
capable
of
acting
in
a
detached
neutral
manner
so
that
his
finding,
his
certification
for
probable
cause
should
be
entitled
to
as
much
weight
certainly
as
a
finding
of
probable
cause
by
a
grand
jury.
we
submit
to
this
court,
respectfully,
that
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
should
thereupon
be
reversed.
