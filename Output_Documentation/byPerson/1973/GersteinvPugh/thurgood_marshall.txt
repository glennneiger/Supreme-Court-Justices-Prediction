justice
thurgood
marshall
can
the
grand
jury
take
up
a
case
that
the
prosecutor
doesn’t
want
them
to
take
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
you
have
this
here
before
the
prosecutor,
are
the
witnesses
sworn?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
where
is
that
in
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn’t
see
that
in
the
statute.
can
you
tell
me
where
it
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
say
that
this
is
a
detached
person,
the
prosecutor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
does
the
states
attorney
in
florida
run
for
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
is
he
any
different
from
the
other
states
attorneys
that
brag
about
how
many
convictions
he’s
got?[laughter]
are
they
different
from
others?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that’s
what
makes
him
unbiased?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
what
makes
him
neutral?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
makes
him
neutral
too,
doesn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
he
neutral
to
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
we
have
no
named
parties
available
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
now
with
--.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
could
he
maintain
a
class
action
without
a
named
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
you
should
hasten
because
i
don’t
agree
with
you
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
but
for
the
florida
cases
to
the
contrary,
wouldn’t
this
all
be
handled
by
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
state
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
wouldn’t
be
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
your
real
complaint,
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
by
habeas
corpus?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
could
raise
it
on
habeas
corpus,
you
wouldn’t
be
here.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
not
talking
about
successfully.
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point
was,
if
it
could
be
raised
and
could
be
cited
and
the
judge
sitting
on
habeas
corpus
could
inquire
into
it,
you
would
have
no
complaint.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
not
automatic.
we
don’t
need
it
automatic,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think,
according
to
your
rule,
every
man
that’s
now
in
jail
has
to
go
before
somebody
within
24
hours
or
turn
him
lose.
my
suggestion
is
you
don’t
get
that
release
unless
you,
yourself,
go
for
habeas
corpus.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
which
do
you
agree
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can
go
for
it
or
not,
you
get
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
everybody
is
automatically
in
a
hearing
on
everything.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
really
don’t
need
that.
