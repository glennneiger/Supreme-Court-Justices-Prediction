mr.
raymond
l.
marky
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
three
rulings
that
were
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
disturbs
florida
in
particular.
number
one
is
that
they
held
a
rule
which
exempted
misdemeanors
from
preliminary
hearings.
it
was
a
deprivation
of
equal
protection
of
the
law.
second,
they
said
the
delay
in
holding
a
preliminary
hearing
in
a
capital
case
or
in
what
florida
calls
a
life
felony
case,
on
the
one
hand,
with
general
felonies
on
the
other.
now,
let
me
back
up
so
the
court
understands.
if
it’s
a
capital
or
a
life
felony,
we
have
seven
days
within
which
to
inform
or
indict.
if
it
is
a
normal
felony,
we
have
four
days.
the
court
of
appeals
held
there
was
no
rational
basis
to
classify
these
different
crimes
and
have
these
different
periods,
and
that
it
constituted
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
the
third,
of
course,
was
that
we
had
to
mandatorily
have
preliminary
hearings
notwithstanding
the
filing
of
the
information.
now,
all
of
this
of
course
is
of
interest
to
the
state
of
florida
because
these
are
rules
of
statewide
applications.
insofar
as
the
misdemeanant
are
concerned,
the
misdemeanant
petitioner
in
this
case
is
charged
with,
first,
possession
of
marijuana,
case
bail
of
60
days,
$500
fine.
rule
5
of
this
court
exempts
from
preliminary
hearings
heavy
offenders,
6
months,
$500
fine.
so,
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
either
wrong
or
this
court’s
rule
is
unconstitutional
because
you
are,
in
fact,
discriminating
between
a
petty
offender
and
a
felon.
that’s
quite
clear.
i
think
it
is
vivid
and
i
think
the
opinion
must
follow
this
court’s
rule
in
this
fault.
the
second
one,
the
delayed
hearing,
i
think
really
misses
the
mark.
there
is
a
rational
basis
to
classify
these
two
crimes.
under
our
rule,
it’s
rule
3.130,
first
appearance,
we
got
to
show,
in
a
capital
case
or
a
life
felony,
presumption
great,
proof
evident
or
he
has
a
right
to
bail.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
a
magistrate,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
we’re
having
a
bail
hearing
in
24
hours
and
if
we
can’t
show
a
proof
evident,
presumption
great
in
a
capital
or
life
felony,
this
man
is
entitled
to
bail.
so,
he
is
getting
a
hearing.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
in
that
instance,
your
honor,
we
still
have
a
rational
classification.
i’ll
tell
you
what
it
is.
in
a
capital
offense,
under
florida
constitution,
there
must
be
an
indictment.
so
the
state
attorney,
in
addition
to
filtering
this
evidence
before
himself
sworn
he
must,
in
necessity,
take
in
additional
step
not
requiring
the
other
felony.
by
then,
taking
this
to
a
grand
jury
and
presenting
it
to
them,
a
duplicitous
step
which
is
additional
to
the
normal
felony.
and
it
is
that
ministerial
administrative
function
that,
we
submit
to
you,
justifies
the
additional
three
days
on
this
more
serious
crime.
so
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
discrimination,
your
honor,
of
equal
protection
between
the
seven
days
and
the
three
days.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
that
statute
was,
or
that
rule
was
unconstitutional
because
of
equal
protection.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no,
that’s
statewide,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
which
brings
me
to
the
third
element
of
the
court’s
ruling,
your
honor,
under
the
old
system,
it
was
no
good
and
i’ll
stand
here
and
tell
you
that.
the
state
attorney
was
not
required
to
file
an
information
in
any
particular
time.
if
the
man
was
in
custody,
he
had
to
stay
there
for
a
period
of
30
days
before
he
could
do
anything,
whether
an
information
was
brought
down
or
not.
consequently,
we
had
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
in
the
district
court
and,
that
is,
that
a
man
languishes
in
jail
for
two
weeks,
three
weeks,
months
before
information
is
even
filed.
now,
that’s
in
to
the
old
system
but
the
court
transposed
that
historical
problem
in
to
the
present
rules
which
it
doesn't
fit
because
the
state
attorney
better
be
in
there
with
an
information
in
96
hours
or
he’s
going
to
a
hearing.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
that’s
not
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
yes,
but
i
am
going
to
the
problem,
your
honor,
of
this
long
detention
before
anything
occurs.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
but
after
the
information
is
filed,
a
whole
host
of
things
happen
including
florida’s
criminal
rules.
it
provides,
as
3.190v,
provides
for
in
a
nature
of
a
summary
judgment
they
can
come
anytime
in
a
form
of
a
motion
to
dismiss.
now,
as
the
come
and
stated
it,
we
admit
that
these
are
the
facts
and
this
is
the
facts
of
this
man’s
entitled
to
release.
it’s
unique
to
florida.
it’s
the
only
rule
i’ve
ever
heard
of
a
criminal
summary
judgment,
but
florida
law
authorizes
it
which
gets
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
yes.[laughter]
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
it
--
your
honor,
which
brings
me
to
the
point.
you
can’t
take
the
episode
here
in
ignorance
of
all
of
the
other
florida
rules.
florida
has
the
most
comprehensive
rules
of
discovery.
now,
under
coleman
versus
alabama
which
tells
us
why
preliminary
hearing
is
important
to
having
the
man
discharged,
early
pretrial
release,
the
discovering
of
the
state’s
case,
in
certain
insanity
presentations.
florida
provides
for
your
pretrial
at
your
own
recognizance,
24
hours
hearing
on
bail.
secondly,
we
have
these
rules
of
discovery
which
are
broader
than
any
in
the
united
states.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
i
think
what
it
has
to
do
with
it,
your
honor,
is
that
what
a
man
gets
under
our
comprehensive
overall
scheme
is
much
deeper
in
terms
of
preparing
himself
than
anything
he
would
get
out
of
his
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
well
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
but
the
point
that
i’m
getting
at
is
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
at
the
district
court
and
at
the
court
of
appeals
level
was
this
two
months
protraction.
and
florida
has,
as
i’m
trying
to
illustrate,
it
is
a
companion
package
of
rules
designed
to
stop
this
long
delay
and
that’s
what
the
first
appearance
and
the
immediate
information
is
all
about.
then
your
mandatory
speedy
trial
in
60
days
on
misdemeanors
and
90
days
on
felonies,
which,
i
think
cannot
be
ignored
in
the
totality
of
his
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
apparently,
you
and
i
are
not
communicating,
your
honor,
because
the
very
purpose
expressed
in
coleman
by
mr.
justice
white
was
that
he
was
concerned
that
we
would
result
in
a
dispensing
with
preliminary
hearings
if
we
required
counsel
at
them.
and
this
court
cataloged
all
of
the
important
features
that
a
preliminary
hearing
serves
and
i
am
merely
trying
to
convince
the
court
that
it’s
there.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
alright.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
of
course,
i
understand
the
point
and
you
are
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
taking
the
assumption
that
the
bail
has
been
denied
and
all
these.
in
that
context
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
in
that
context
then,
your
honor,
we
quite
agree
with
the
petitioner
in
the
case
that
beck
versus
washington
very
definitely
qualifies
a
state
attorney
as
a
one-man
grand
jury
and
that
this
is
really
akin
to
morrissey
which
was
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals.
you
didn’t
require
a
magistrate
there.
it
was
just
someone
who
was
not
directly
involved
in
what
it
was
that
brought
about
the
man’s
incarceration.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
i
understand
the
distinction,
but
then
we
are
presented
with
this
court’s
rule
5
where
a
man
happens
to
be
indicted.
he
gets
no
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
that’s
right.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
i
understand
the
dichotomy
of
the
lay
person’s
12
out
of
18
in
florida
must
return
the
indictment,
but
i
would
submit
to
your
honor
that
if
the
indictment
is
that
different,
then
why
did
this
court
say
that
the
states
may
choose
to
bring
to
trial
pursuant
to
an
information
as
opposed
to
an
indictment
that
the
federal
government
has.
if
it
was
that
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
but
i
think
it
nevertheless
follows,
your
honor
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
i
understand
what
the
court
is
saying,
but
the
treating
of
these
two
types
of
bringing
to
trial
as
sufficiently
alike
to
not
require
indictments
by
the
states
linked
up
with
beck
versus
washington,
as
counsel
has
pointed
out
and
as
quoted
in
the
brief,
makes
it
clear
that
i
think
the
state
attorney
is
sufficiently
removed
to
where
he
is
not
directly
involved
to
bring
in
this
charge.
he’s
certainly
confident
to
decide
the
question.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
by
the
electorate,
yes.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
your
honor,
i’m
not
prepared
to
answer
that
question.
i’m
not
familiar
with
the
state
attorneys
or
their
political
campaigns
that
closely
to
even
answer
the
question.
i
think
a
state
attorney
in
the
statistics
in
this
record
bear
it
out.
he’s
not
likely
to
file
an
information
in
a
case
where
he
can’t
even
get
by
a
directed
verdict.
i
mean,
i
think
the
man
would
have
to
be
somewhat
foolish
to
set
about
a
course
of
filing
information
knowing
he
doesn’t
have
the
evidence.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
i
think
it
makes
him
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
it
certainly
makes
him
reflective,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
that,
i
guess
the
court
will
have
to
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
i’d
have
to
dispose
of
that.
the
state’s
position
is
that
florida
has
tried
to
emulate
this
court’s
rule
5,
the
spirit
of
that
rule
5,
notwithstanding
the
differences
between
indictments
and
information.
and
that
it
has
substantially
changed
the
time
within
which
a
man
must
be
picked
up,
brought
to
a
judge.
an
amicus
and
in
a
course
of
appeal,
they
constantly
refer
to
mcnabb,
and
they
keep
saying
“well,
what
we
need
is
mcnabb.”
and,
i
think
that
this
is
somewhat
amusing
for
our
rule
and
the
first
appearance
is
mcnabb.
as
i
understand
mcnabb
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
three
rulings
that
were
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
disturbs
florida
in
particular.
number
one
is
that
they
held
a
rule
which
exempted
misdemeanors
from
preliminary
hearings.
it
was
a
deprivation
of
equal
protection
of
the
law.
second,
they
said
the
delay
in
holding
a
preliminary
hearing
in
a
capital
case
or
in
what
florida
calls
a
life
felony
case,
on
the
one
hand,
with
general
felonies
on
the
other.
now,
let
me
back
up
so
the
court
understands.
if
it’s
a
capital
or
a
life
felony,
we
have
seven
days
within
which
to
inform
or
indict.
if
it
is
a
normal
felony,
we
have
four
days.
the
court
of
appeals
held
there
was
no
rational
basis
to
classify
these
different
crimes
and
have
these
different
periods,
and
that
it
constituted
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
the
third,
of
course,
was
that
we
had
to
mandatorily
have
preliminary
hearings
notwithstanding
the
filing
of
the

now,
all
of
this
of
course
is
of

to
the
state
of
florida
because
these
are
rules
of
statewide
applications.
insofar
as
the
misdemeanant
are
concerned,
the
misdemeanant
petitioner
in
this
case
is
charged
with,
first,
possession
of
marijuana,
case
bail
of
60
days,
$500
fine.
rule
5
of
this
court
exempts
from
preliminary
hearings
heavy
offenders,
6
months,
$500
fine.
so,
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
either
wrong
or
this
court’s
rule
is
unconstitutional
because
you
are,
in
fact,
discriminating
between
a
petty
offender
and
a
felon.
that’s
quite
clear.
i
think
it
is
vivid
and
i
think
the
opinion
must
follow
this
court’s
rule
in
this
fault.
the
second
one,
the
delayed
hearing,
i
think
really
misses
the
mark.
there
is
a
rational
basis
to
classify
these
two
crimes.
under
our
rule,
it’s
rule
3.130,
first
appearance,
we
got
to
show,
in
a
capital
case
or
a
life
felony,
presumption
great,
proof
evident
or
he
has
a
right
to
bail.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
a
magistrate,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
we’re
having
a
bail
hearing
in
24
hours
and
if
we
can’t
show
a
proof
evident,
presumption
great
in
a
capital
or
life
felony,
this
man
is
entitled
to
bail.
so,
he
is
getting
a
hearing.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
in
that
instance,
your
honor,
we
still
have
a
rational
classification.
i’ll
tell
you
what
it
is.
in
a
capital
offense,
under
florida
constitution,
there
must
be
an
indictment.
so
the
state
attorney,
in
addition
to
filtering
this
evidence
before
himself
sworn
he
must,
in
necessity,
take
in
additional
step
not
requiring
the
other

by
then,
taking
this
to
a
grand

and
presenting
it
to

a
duplicitous
step
which
is
additional
to
the
normal

and
it
is
that
ministerial
administrative
function
that,
we
submit
to
you,
justifies
the
additional
three
days
on
this
more
serious
crime.
so
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no,
i
am
talking
about
the
discrimination,
your
honor,
of
equal
protection
between
the
seven
days
and
the
three
days.
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
that
statute
was,
or
that
rule
was
unconstitutional
because
of
equal
protection.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
no,
that’s
statewide,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
which
brings
me
to
the
third
element
of
the
court’s
ruling,
your
honor,
under
the
old
system,
it
was
no
good
and
i’ll
stand
here
and
tell
you
that.
the
state
attorney
was
not
required
to
file
an
information
in
any
particular
time.
if
the
man
was
in
custody,
he
had
to
stay
there
for
a
period
of
30

before
he
could

whether

consequently,
we

in

and,
that
is,
that

two

three

months
before

now,
that’s
in
to
the

system
but
the
court
transposed
that
historical

in
to
the
present
rules
which
it
doesn't

because
the
state
attorney
better
be

with

in
96

or
he’s
going
to
a
hearing.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
that’s
not
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
yes,
but
i
am
going
to
the
problem,
your
honor,
of
this
long
detention
before
anything
occurs.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
but
after
the
information
is
filed,
a
whole
host
of
things
happen
including
florida’s
criminal

it

the
facts
and
this
is
the
facts
of
this
man’s
entitled
to
release.
it’s
unique
to
florida.
it’s
the
only
rule
i’ve
ever
heard
of
a
criminal
summary
judgment,
but
florida
law
authorizes
it
which
gets
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
yes.[laughter]
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
it
--
your
honor,
which
brings
me
to
the
point.
you
can’t
take
the
episode
here
in
ignorance
of
all
of
the
other
florida
rules.
florida
has
the
most
comprehensive
rules
of
discovery.
now,
under
coleman
versus
alabama
which
tells
us
why
preliminary
hearing
is
important
to
having
the
man
discharged,
early
pretrial
release,
the
discovering
of
the
state’s
case,
in
certain
insanity
presentations.
florida
provides
for
your
pretrial
at
your
own
recognizance,
24
hours
hearing
on
bail.
secondly,
we
have
these
rules
of
discovery
which
are
broader
than
any
in
the
united
states.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
i
think
what
it
has
to
do
with
it,
your
honor,
is
that
what
a
man
gets
under
our
comprehensive
overall
scheme
is
much
deeper
in
terms
of
preparing
himself
than
anything
he
would
get
out
of
his
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
well
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
but
the
point
that
i’m
getting
at
is
the
gravamen
of
the
complaint
at
the
district
court
and
at
the
court
of
appeals
level
was
this
two
months
protraction.
and
florida
has,
as
i’m
trying
to
illustrate,
it
is
a
companion
package
of
rules
designed
to
stop
this
long
delay
and
that’s
what
the
first
appearance
and
the
immediate
information
is
all
about.
then
your
mandatory
speedy
trial
in
60
days
on
misdemeanors
and
90
days
on
felonies,
which,
i
think
cannot
be
ignored
in
the
totality
of
his
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
apparently,
you
and
i
are
not
communicating,
your
honor,
because
the
very
purpose
expressed
in
coleman
by
mr.
justice
white
was
that
he
was
concerned
that
we
would
result
in
a
dispensing
with
preliminary
hearings
if
we
required
counsel
at
them.
and
this
court
cataloged
all
of
the
important
features
that
a
preliminary
hearing
serves
and
i
am
merely
trying
to
convince
the
court
that
it’s
there.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
alright.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
of
course,
i
understand
the
point
and
you
are
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
taking
the
assumption
that
the
bail
has
been
denied
and
all
these.
in
that
context
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
in
that
context
then,
your
honor,
we
quite
agree
with
the
petitioner
in
the
case
that
beck
versus
washington
very
definitely
qualifies
a
state
attorney
as
a
one-man
grand
jury
and
that
this
is
really
akin
to
morrissey
which
was
cited
by
the
court
of
appeals.
you
didn’t
require
a
magistrate
there.
it
was
just
someone
who
was
not
directly
involved
in
what
it
was
that
brought
about
the
man’s
incarceration.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
i
understand
the
distinction,
but
then
we
are
presented
with
this
court’s
rule
5
where
a
man
happens
to
be
indicted.
he
gets
no
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
that’s
right.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
i
understand
the
dichotomy
of
the
lay
person’s
12
out
of
18
in
florida
must
return
the
indictment,
but
i
would
submit
to
your
honor
that
if
the
indictment
is
that
different,
then
why
did
this
court
say
that
the
states
may
choose
to
bring
to
trial
pursuant
to
an
information
as
opposed
to
an
indictment
that
the
federal
government
has.
if
it
was
that
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
but
i
think
it
nevertheless
follows,
your
honor
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
i
understand
what
the
court
is
saying,
but
the
treating
of
these
two
types
of
bringing
to
trial
as
sufficiently
alike
to
not
require
indictments
by
the
states
linked
up
with
beck
versus
washington,
as
counsel
has
pointed
out
and
as
quoted
in
the
brief,
makes
it
clear
that
i
think
the
state
attorney
is
sufficiently
removed
to
where
he
is
not
directly
involved
to
bring
in
this
charge.
he’s
certainly
confident
to
decide
the
question.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
by
the
electorate,
yes.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
your
honor,
i’m
not
prepared
to
answer
that
question.
i’m
not
familiar
with
the
state
attorneys
or
their
political
campaigns
that
closely
to
even
answer
the
question.
i
think
a
state
attorney
in
the
statistics
in
this
record
bear
it
out.
he’s
not
likely
to
file
an
information
in
a
case
where
he
can’t
even
get
by
a
directed
verdict.
i
mean,
i
think
the
man
would
have
to
be
somewhat
foolish
to
set
about
a
course
of
filing
information
knowing
he
doesn’t
have
the
evidence.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
i
think
it
makes
him
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
it
certainly
makes
him
reflective,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
that,
i
guess
the
court
will
have
to
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
i’d
have
to
dispose
of
that.
the
state’s
position
is
that
florida
has
tried
to
emulate
this
court’s
rule
5,
the
spirit
of
that
rule
5,
notwithstanding
the
differences
between
indictments
and
information.
and
that
it
has
substantially
changed
the
time
within
which
a
man
must
be
picked
up,
brought
to
a
judge.
an
amicus
and
in
a
course
of
appeal,
they
constantly
refer
to
mcnabb,
and
they
keep
saying
“well,
what
we
need
is
mcnabb.”
and,
i
think
that
this
is
somewhat
amusing
for
our
rule
and
the
first
appearance
is
mcnabb.
as
i
understand
mcnabb
--
mr.
raymond
l.
marky
thank
you,
your
honor.
