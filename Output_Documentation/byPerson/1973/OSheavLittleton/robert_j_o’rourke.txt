mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
thank
you
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
civil
rights
suit
brought
by
plaintiff’s
on
behalf
of
an
undefined
class
which
they
were
not
members
charging
that
the
defendants
michael
o’shea
that
the
magistrate
of
the
circuit
court
of
alexander
county,
illinois
and
dorothy
spomer
as
an
associate
judge
for
alexander
county,
illinois,
systematically
discriminated
against
members
of
there
class
on
the
basis
of
race.
this
action
was
brought
under
the
civil
rights
act
title
42,
sections
1981,
1982,
1983,
and
1985
and
alleged
interference
with
the
plaintiffs’
first,
sixth,
eighth,
thirteenth,
and
fourteenth
amendments
rights.
the
plaintiffs
sought
mandatory
injunctive
relief
against
o’shea
and
spomer
in
their
official
capacity
as
members
of
the
illinois
judiciary.
the
amended
complaint
in
the
first,
second,
third
and
fourth
claims
for
relief
set
out
11
specific
acts
of
alleged
discriminatory
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
defendants’
state’s
attorney
berbling
and
investigator
shepherd.
the
one
claim
for
relief
which
is
the
sixth
claim
which
pertains
to
the
judges
comprises
generally
and
conclusory
allegations
of
patterns
and
practices
of
discriminatory
conduct
on
the
part
of
these
defendant
judges.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no,
sir
he
was
not.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
that’s
correct
your
honor.
spomer
is
--
state’s
attorney
spomer
and
is
not
to
be
confused
with
the
judge
whose
also
by
the
name
of
spomer,
was
just
elected
the
state’s
attorney
of
alexander
county
and
that's
substituted
in
this
clause.
because
of
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
i
believe
that
they
are
husband
and
wife,
your
honor.
the
alleged
conduct
against
the
judges
includes
the
following
of
averments.
a
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
certainly.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no,
sir.
there
are
--
it’s
the
contention
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
that’s
correct
and
the
contention
is
that
the
office
will
in
the
future
in
somewhat
discriminate.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
they
do.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
well,
that’s
a
contention
that
we
don’t
agree
with,
your
honor.
that
is
our
contention,
however,
we
do
not
agree
with
that.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
that’s
correct,
justice.
the
alleged
conduct
against
the
judges
includes
the
following
allegations:
(a)
the
judges
involved
set
bond
in
criminal
cases
by
following
an
unofficial
bond
schedule
without
regard
to
the
facts
of
the
case
or
the
circumstances
of
the
individual
defendant;
(b)
that
they
sentence
black
persons
to
longer
criminal
terms
and
imposed
harsher
conditions
than
they
do
with
respect
to
white
persons
who
are
charged
with
the
same
or
equivalent
criminal
conduct;
and
(c)
that
they
require
plaintiffs
and
members
of
the
class
to
play
for
a
trial
by
jury
when
charged
with
violations
of
city
ordinances
which
carry
fines
and
possible
jail
penalties
if
the
fine
cannot
be
paid.
though
the
amended
complaint
alleges
in
paragraph
36
(b)
that
o’shea
and
spomer
sentenced
black
persons
to
longer
terms
and
imposed
harsher
conditions
than
for
white
persons
similarly
charged,
the
complaint
does
not
mention
a
single
instance
of
such
conduct
in
the
past
nor
does
it
charge
that
any
sentence
were
not
within
the
judge’s
lawful
discretion.
indeed,
no
plaintiff
has
alleged
to
have
been
among
those
charged,
bailed
or
sentenced.
furthermore,
no
plaintiff
has
alleged
to
be
threatened
with
the
possibility
of
requiring
bail
or
being
sentenced.
the
plaintiffs
do
not
set
forth
any
fact
or
allege
a
single
instance
of
improper
bail
procedure
or
excessive
sentence
in
the
amended
complaint.
moreover,
no
other
allegation
of
plaintiffs’
complaint
evidences
or
supports
the
conclusory
allegations
in
the
sixth
claim
for
relief
against
the
defendant
judges.
the
plaintiffs
additionally,
do
not
indicate
any
request
for
relief,
either
by
habeas
corpus
or
by
appellate
review
which
has
been
made
by
any
member
of
there
class
or
by
anyone
else
for
past
judicial
discrimination
by
either
of
the
defendant
judges.
the
allegations
regarding
the
setting
of
bonds
and
the
payment
for
jury
trails,
do
not
state
the
respondents
are
treated
differently
than
any
other
persons.
it
is
merely
averred
in
general
terms
that
the
petitioners
follow
an
unofficial
bond
schedule
in
criminal
cases.
no
charge
is
made
as
has
been
done
with
respect
to
sentencing
practices
that
there
exists
discrimination
in
treatment
of
white
and
black
persons.
the
sole
issue
was
drawn
by
the
pleadings
relates
only
to
the
allegation
of
the
judges’
discretionary
role
in
imposing
sentence
on
a
lawfully
convicted
defendant.
the
complaint
is
completely
barren
of
any
factual
averment
involving
the
defendant
judges
and
contains
only
one
allegation
of
discrimination
by
the
judges
and
that
is
relative
to
the
sentencing
practice
and
this
allegation
is
alleged
only
on
information
and
belief.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaints
on
grounds:
one,
that
it
lack
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
clause
seeking
to
have
a
federal
court
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
judgment
of
the
state
judiciary;
and
two,
that
no
regular
performance
of
judicial
officers’
duties,
judicial
immunity,
barred
relief
in
an
action
under
the
civil
rights
act.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
a
two-to-one
decision
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
ruled
that
a
federal
court
may
entertain
actions
requiring
federal
supervision
and
regulation
by
mandatory
injunction
over
the
discretion
which
state
court
judges
may
lawfully
exercise
within
the
limits
of
authority
granted
to
them
by
law.
the
court
of
appeals
held,
one,
that
the
complaint
stated
a
clause
of
action
against
these
practitioners
under
the
civil
rights
act
sections
1891,
1981,
excuse
me,
1983
and
perhaps
under
1982;
and
two,
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
did
not
extend
to
the
defendant
judges
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
and
the
ku
klux
klan
act
of
1871
where
injunctive
relief
is
sought.
the
seventh
circuit
recognizing
that
this
holding
created
a
case
of
first
impression
volunteered
guidelines
which
the
federal
district
court
might
follow
in
imposing
upon
the
state
judges
a
system
of
reporting
their
conduct
and
the
disposition
of
their
cases
in
the
district
court.
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
would
permit
the
intimidation
of
state
court
judges
and
would
deprive
the
state
of
an
independent
and
intellectually
free
judicial
system.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
common
law
doctrine
of
providing
civil
judicial
meaning
for
judicial
acts
was
not
abolished
by
the
congressional
civil
rights
amendments,
regardless
of
whether
the
damages
are
mandatory
or
mandatory
damages
are
sought.
this
court
established
before
in
the
classic
case
of
bradley
versus
fisher
which
we
cite
very
extensively
in
our
brief,
that
the
purpose
of
judicial
immunity
is
to
assure
the
independents
of
the
judicial
judgment
by
precluding
personal
jeopardy
of
the
judges
who
might
err.
we
submit
that
the
sanctions
of
the
contempt
are
as
dangerous
to
judicial
independents
as
a
risk
of
a
suit
for
money
damages.
one
cannot
visualize
a
more
dramatic
example
of
judicial
subordination
on
the
spectacle
of
having
a
state
judge
brought
before
a
federal
district
court
on
the
claim
of
injunction
and
put
to
the
ignominity
of
having
to
sit
on
the
witness
stand,
defend
the
integrity
of
his
character
and
his
actions
and
be
subjected
on
cross-examination
to
the
verbal
onslaught
of
a
class
of
people
as
in
this
particular
instance
who
had
never
been
before
that
particular
judge
at
any
time.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no,
i
don’t
say
that
if
the
court
please,
i
don’t
mean
to
lead
that
impression.
judge
dillon
did
review
the
cases
where
injunctions
have
been
granted
and
pointed
out
that
injunctions
had
been
granted
for
the
--
or
prohibitory
type
of
injunction
rather
than
a
mandatory
injunction
which
prohibits
a
court
from
and
in
these
particular
instances
that
they
cite
which
were
ministerial
acts
rather
than
judicial
acts
requiring
judicial
discretion.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no,
sir
we
would
not.
it
would
be
a
prohibitive
act
and
not
the
constant
supervision
where
the
judge
could
be
called
in
to
be
subjected
to
cross-examination.
while
on
that
federal
standards
state
judge
could
compelled
to
recall
his
past
decisions
and
the
reasoning
behind
those
decisions.
for
the
instance
like
the
present
case,
the
judge
may
not
only
be
on
trial
with
respect
to
an
individual
case,
but
for
patterns
and
practices
which
comprised
within
their
purview
many
decisions
extending
through
a
number
of
years.
the
effect
of
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
will
be
to
chill
judicial
discretion
in
disposition
of
the
justice
in
the
state
of
illinois.
in
effect
then,
a
state
judge
will
have
to
look
over
his
shoulder
each
time
he
exercises
his
judicial
discretion
for
fear
that
by
some
nebulous
standard
of
statistical
analysis,
he
has
not
meted
out
justice
in
accordance
with
the
federal
district
judge's
personal
formula.
in
addition,
a
state
judge
would
be
more
likely
to
quantify
or
balance
sentences
or
amounts
of
bail
not
in
accordance
with
what
the
circumstances
are
before
him
or
what
the
circumstances
would
have
warranted,
but
out
of
the
nagging
fear
that
leniency
or
strictness
irrespective
of
whether
deserved
over
a
period
of
time
would
be
interpreted
as
deliberate
discriminatory
conduct.
subjecting
a
state
judge
to
federal
review
each
time
a
dissatisfied,
but
lawfully
committed
defendant
alleges
class
discrimination
which
would
require
federal
judges
to
conduct
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
determine
whether
a
pattern
of
discrimination
existed.
a
judge
operating
under
an
order
not
to
discriminate
in
fixing
bonds
and
sentences
would
find
himself
confronted
with
the
possibility
of
a
federal
contempt
citation
and
the
necessity
to
defend
his
motivation
in
each
case.
the
admonishment
of
this
court
in
the
city
of
greenwood
versus
peacock
would
apply
to
this
case
equally
as
well.
but
the
burden
of
the
federal
system
would
be
in
the
least
cumbersome
and
severe.
the
effect
on
the
state
system
would
be
to
create
in
the
press
of
atmosphere
of
federal
supervision
and
perhaps
render
it
impotent.
the
action
countenance
by
the
court
below
would
result
in
the
federal
court
sitting
not
only
in
review
of
state
discretionary
decisions,
but
also
as
the
appellate
tribunal
passing
ultimate
judgment
on
state
criminal
proceedings.
we
hold
this
--
the
action
sanction
here
is
civil
that
requires
the
review
of
past
criminal
decisions.
in
addition,
the
likelihood
of
a
great
similar
class
actions
would
be
taken
to
the
district
courts
from
state
criminal
actions
on
the
ground
that
the
judge
will
or
has
a
propensity
to
discriminate
against
a
particular
group.
the
result
would
be
to
exchange
state
remedies
in
favor
of
district
court
review.
extending
the
possibility
of
sanction
by
this
court
below
to
its
most
absurd
result,
a
state
court
judge
could
literally
spend
so
much
time
defending
his
actions
in
frivolous
suits
in
the
federal
bar,
that
he
could
not
perform
his
state
judicial
duties.
again,
an
admonishment
from
the
city
of
peacock
--
or
city
of
greenwood
versus
peacock
case.
it
must
be
noted
that
the
decision
of
the
courts
of
appeal
for
the
seventh
circuit
does
not
limit
its
holding
to
lower
state
court
judges.
indeed,
the
application
of
the
seventh
circuit
court’s
decision
renders
all
state
judges
subject
to
injunctive
relief
should
some
class
allege
that
they
have
engaged
in
patterns
and
practices
which
they
feel
violate
their
civil
rights.
therefore,
this
decision
if
it
allowed
to
remain
in
effect
could
easily
propel
a
rash
of
federal
injunctive
proceedings
against
state
appellate
court
based
upon
the
naked
allegation
that
the
appellate
justices
or
any
combination
of
them
engaged
in
patterns
and
practices
of
conduct
inimical
to
the
civil
rights
of
the
complaining
class.
the
unfitting
bowl
given
to
judicial
immunity
doctrine
by
the
seventh
circuit
court
irrevocably
alters
the
historic
relationship
that
has
existed
between
the
courts
of
equity
and
the
lower
courts,
between
the
federal
state
--
federal
courts
and
the
state
courts,
and
between
the
judge
and
those
persons
appearing
before
him.
the
effect
of
permitting
actions
against
the
state
judiciary
going
out
of
the
exercise
of
lawful
discretion
would
be
too
irreparably
harm
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
at
the
state
level.
we
submit
that
no
intellectually
independent
state
judiciary
could
survive
in
an
atmosphere
of
hostile
litigants
and
the
constant
federal
supervision.
we
believe
that
the
question
of
judicial
immunity
had
been
of
question
of
whether
judicial
immunity
had
been
abolished
by
the
civil
rights
act
was
answered
by
this
court
in
pierson
versus
ray
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
that
this
court
held
that
the
common
law
immunity
of
judges
from
civil
action
for
acts
committed
within
their
judicial
discretion
was
so
subtle
a
principle
as
to
be
accepted
from
the
provisions
of
section
1983.
furthermore,
this
court
in
pierson
considered
the
same
legislative
history
which
the
court
below
held
to
be
so
incisive
and
found
that
history
a
warning.
so
much
so,
that
the
case
states
that
gives
no
clear
indication
that
congress
meant
to
abolish
wholesale,
all
common
law
immunities.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
expressed
the
feelings
of
eight
members
of
that
court
when
he
wrote.
“we
presume
that
congress
would
have
specifically
so
provide
had
it
wished
to
abolish
this
doctrine.”
nothing
in
the
explicit
language
of
pierson
affords
a
basis
to
limit
that
holding
to
money
damages
especially
in
the
light
of
the
chief
justice
compelling
language
which
draws
no
distinction
between
monetary
and
equable
relief.
he
said
it
at
page
554,
“it
is
a
judges’
duty
to
decide
all
cases
within
his
jurisdiction
which
are
brought
before
him,
including
controversial
cases
which
arouse
the
most
intense
feelings
in
litigants.
his
errors
maybe
corrected
on
appeal,
but
he
should
not
have
to
feel
that
unsatisfied
litigants
may
hound
him
with
litigation
charging
him
with
malice
or
corruption.
imposing
such
a
burden
on
judges
would
contribute
not
too
principle
and
fearless
decision
making
but
to
intimidation.”
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
court
draws
the
narrow
distinction
that
while
judges
are
immune
from
damage
suits,
they
maybe
subjected
to
a
mandatory
injunction
if
ever
anyone
should
charge
them
in
the
federal
courts
with
class
discrimination.
the
defendant
judges
submit
that
no
distinction
can
logically
be
made
as
to
judicial
immunity
between
damages
and
an
injunctive
order
for
a
judge’s
lawful
exercise
of
his
discretion.
the
decision
of
the
two-man
majority
in
the
court
below
is
well-written.
but
we
submit
at
a
careful
reading
of
the
decisions
cited
by
the
seventh
circuit
wherein
injunctive
relief
has
been
granted,
would
reveal
that
these
cases
either
deal
with
ministerial
duties
exercised
by
a
judicial
office
or
the
cases
do
not
discuss
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
or
ex
parte
proceedings
in
which
the
accused
judge
didn’t
participate
are
based
upon
the
misapprehension
of
other
decisions
utilized
as
precedents.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
there
is
a
difference
if
the
court
please.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
well,
there,
there
is
the
prohibitory
injunction
again
and
here
the
injunction
has
come
down
from
the
seventh
circuit
as
a
mandatory
type
of
thing.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no,
sir.
not
in
pierson.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
it
has
been
distinguished
in
the
various
courts
but
we
indicate
that
the
essence
of
the
rule
of
judicial
immunity
is
the
freedom
of
judge
from
the
threat
of
individual
punishment
in
the
event
that
a
different
court
should
decide
that
its
judgment
wasn’t
correct
in
the
first
place.
and
we
maintain
it’s
unrelated
to
the
nature
of
the
suit
whether
it’s
a
civil
right
action
or
whether
it’s
a
individual
action
or
it’s
an
action
brought
by
an
individual
or
by
a
class.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
well,
we
maintained
there
is
a
scope
of
limited
argument
here
too.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
both
of
them,
if
the
court
please.
we
are
arguing
judicial
immunity,
we
are
also
argued
in
scope
of
the
remedy.
we
also
make
the
additional
argument
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
a
prohibitory
injunction?
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
which
prohibits
him
from
a
doing
a
certain
acts,
yes
certainly.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
i
would
concede
that,
yes
sir.
to
not
to
handle
certain
case
or
not
performing
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
not
the
former
ministerial
duty.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
that
in
the
scope
of
the
order
of
the
seventh
circuit
which
requires
a
constant
supervision
of
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
not
as
far
as
the
defendant
judges
are
concerned.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
even
if
all
the
facts
were
true,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
the
remedy
is
here
if
the
court
please,
there
is
no
specific
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
there
is
no
specific
allegation
against
either
one
of
these
judges
as
to
a
discriminatory
act
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
it’s
merely
conclusionary
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no,
there
are
number
of
remedy
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
there
is
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes
sir
because
they
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes
sir,
there
would
be
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
it’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
it
would
be,
except
that
we
wanted
to
get
into
the
question
of
judicial
immunity
because
we
feel
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
sir.
if
i
can
just
get
back
to
justice
marshall’s
question.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
i
say
there's
not,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
right.
there
is
also
the
--
to
get
back
to
justice
marshall’s
question
there’s
ample
provision
for
a
review
in
our
appellate
courts.
if
the
judge
where
to
be
as
discriminatory
as
you
point
out
there
is
also
the
question
of
the
illinois
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no,
sir
i
don’t
have
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
i
don’t
have
one.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
also
to
get
to
the
question
of
the
--
constitution
of
the
united
states
provides
an
article
4,
section
4
that
the
united
states
shall
guarantee
to
every
state,
a
republican
form
of
government,
essential
to
the
concept
of
republican
form
of
government
is
the
state
judiciary
remain
free
to
pass
upon
its
own
laws
without
fear
of
district
court’s
surveillance.
where
a
pattern
emerges
or
is
allowed
to
emerge
that
the
state
judicial
officers
can
be
summoned
before
a
federal
district
court
on
the
mere
allegation
that
they
engaged
in
the
patterns
and
practices
of
conduct
somehow
inimical
to
the
class
then
the
obvious
result
would
be
the
destruction
of
the
state
judiciary
and
thereby
the
republican
form
of
government.
if
the
court
please,
i’d
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
thank
you,
your
honor.
if
the
court
please
again,
we
would
like
bring
out
that
nowhere
in
the
complaint
as
the
court
has
indicated
in
asking
the
questions,
do
we
find
that
any
plaintiff
that
has
been
named
has
been
brought
before
this
court,
has
been
charged,
bailed,
or
sentenced.
furthermore,
there
is
not
one
single
instance
pleaded
within
the
complaint
of
discriminatory
practice.
counsel
has
indicated
that
there
has
been
a
pattern
and
practice
over
the
years
of
discriminatory
conduct,
it
could
be
very
easily
shown
that
if
there
is
such
a
pattern
or
practice
that
are
individual
instances,
that
there
are
differences
between
the
pattern
sentencing
between
white
and
blacks,
we
submit
that
we
read
the
complaint
as
far
as
the
sentencing
charge
not
that
there
is
a
discrimination
between
white
and
black
persons
as
far
as
bail
is
concerned,
but
that
only
that
they
use
unofficial
bond
schedule
in
criminal
cases
and
that
solely
it.
we
also
submit
that
the
allegations
as
have
been
charged
here
in
a
civil
rights
case
that
the
holdings
of
the
courts
have
been
that
in
civil
rights
action
the
pleadings
must
be
specific
in
the
case
people
ex
rel
holf
versus
ballinger
(ph)
is
such
a
case
that
hold
that
these
pleadings
be
specific.
we
maintain
that
nowhere
in
any
of
the
pleadings
and
nowhere
in
the
argument
has
there
been
any
allegation
made
that
these
particular
judges,
o’shea
and
spomer
have
been
guilty
of
a
discriminatory
act
relative
to
white
and
black
persons.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
they
have
already
amended
once
if
the
court
please
and
we
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
well,
that
might
be
possible.
i
don’t
know.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
we
think
that
if
they
got
specific
as
far
as
the
state’s
attorney
berbling
is
concerned
and
point
out
specific
acts
of
discrimination.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
i
would
say
that
in
those
specific
instances
if
there
where
such
specific
instance
that
the
remedies
we
have
within
our
state
court
system
would
be
able
to
take
care
of
that.
we
also
point
out
that
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
that’s
possible.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
this
goes
with
the
argument
i
started
to
make
if
the
court
please
that
if
they
got
specific
in
11
specific
instances
as
far
as
the
state’s
attorney
is
concerned
that
they
could
very
easily
have
gotten
specific
as
far
as
the
judges’
concerned.
as
the
matter
of
fact
those
11
specific
instances,
there's
not
once
instance
there
where
any
of
the
key
parties
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
well,
that’s
one
of
the
issues
that
if
the
court
please,
the
underlying
--
the
most
important
issue
we
can
contend
is
the
underlying
issue
of
the
state
supervision
by
the
federal
district
court
on
a
continuing
basis.
if
there
are
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
sir.
that’s
correct.
both
for
money
damages
and
from
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
--
the
relief
as
far
as
a
mandatory
type
of
action
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
i
would
say
so.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
and
if
there
are
no
further
question,
we
would
ask
that
based
upon
these
reasons
that
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
be
reversed
as
to
these
defendant
judges
and
that
this
honorable
court
hold
that
the
doctrine
of
the
judicial
immunity
would
apply
in
the
mandatory
injunction
cases.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
thank
you
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
civil
rights
suit
brought
by
plaintiff’s
on
behalf
of
an
undefined
class
which
they
were
not
members
charging
that
the
defendants
michael
o’shea
that
the
magistrate
of
the
circuit
court
of
alexander
county,
illinois
and
dorothy
spomer
as
an
associate
judge
for
alexander
county,
illinois,
systematically
discriminated
against
members
of
there
class
on
the
basis
of
race.
this
action
was
brought
under
the
civil
rights
act
title
42,
sections
1981,
1982,
1983,
and
1985
and
alleged
interference
with
the
plaintiffs’
first,
sixth,
eighth,
thirteenth,
and
fourteenth
amendments
rights.
the
plaintiffs
sought
mandatory
injunctive
relief
against
o’shea
and
spomer
in
their
official
capacity
as
members
of
the
illinois
judiciary.
the
amended
complaint
in
the
first,
second,
third
and
fourth
claims
for
relief
set
out
11
specific
acts
of
alleged
discriminatory
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
defendants’
state’s
attorney
berbling
and
investigator
shepherd.
the
one
claim
for
relief
which
is
the
sixth
claim
which
pertains
to
the
judges
comprises
generally
and
conclusory
allegations
of
patterns
and
practices
of
discriminatory
conduct
on
the
part
of
these
defendant
judges.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no,
sir
he
was
not.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
that’s
correct
your
honor.
spomer
is
--
state’s
attorney
spomer
and
is
not
to
be
confused
with
the
judge
whose
also
by
the
name
of
spomer,
was
just
elected
the
state’s
attorney
of
alexander
county
and
that's
substituted
in
this
clause.
because
of
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
i
believe
that
they
are
husband
and
wife,
your
honor.
the
alleged
conduct
against
the
judges
includes
the
following
of
averments.
a
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
certainly.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no,
sir.
there
are
--
it’s
the
contention
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
that’s
correct
and
the
contention
is
that
the
office
will
in
the
future
in
somewhat
discriminate.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
they
do.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
well,
that’s
a
contention
that
we
don’t
agree
with,
your
honor.
that
is
our
contention,
however,
we
do
not
agree
with
that.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
that’s
correct,
justice.
the
alleged
conduct
against
the
judges
includes
the
following
allegations:
(a)
the
judges
involved
set
bond
in
criminal
cases
by
following
an
unofficial
bond
schedule
without
regard
to
the
facts
of
the
case
or
the
circumstances
of
the
individual
defendant;
(b)
that
they
sentence
black
persons
to
longer
criminal
terms
and
imposed
harsher
conditions
than
they
do
with
respect
to
white
persons
who
are
charged
with
the
same
or
equivalent
criminal
conduct;
and
(c)
that
they
require
plaintiffs
and
members
of
the
class
to
play
for
a
trial
by
jury
when
charged
with
violations
of
city
ordinances
which
carry
fines
and
possible
jail
penalties
if
the
fine
cannot
be
paid.
though
the
amended
complaint
alleges
in
paragraph
36
(b)
that
o’shea
and
spomer
sentenced
black
persons
to
longer
terms
and
imposed
harsher
conditions
than
for
white
persons
similarly
charged,
the
complaint
does
not
mention
a
single
instance
of
such
conduct
in
the
past
nor
does
it
charge
that
any
sentence
were
not
within
the
judge’s
lawful
discretion.
indeed,
no
plaintiff
has
alleged
to
have
been
among
those
charged,
bailed
or
sentenced.
furthermore,
no
plaintiff
has
alleged
to
be
threatened
with
the
possibility
of
requiring
bail
or
being
sentenced.
the
plaintiffs
do
not
set
forth
any
fact
or
allege
a
single
instance
of
improper
bail
procedure
or
excessive
sentence
in
the
amended
complaint.
moreover,
no
other
allegation
of
plaintiffs’
complaint
evidences
or
supports
the
conclusory
allegations
in
the
sixth
claim
for
relief
against
the
defendant
judges.
the
plaintiffs
additionally,
do
not
indicate
any
request
for
relief,
either
by
habeas
corpus
or
by
appellate
review
which
has
been
made
by
any
member
of
there
class
or
by
anyone
else
for
past
judicial
discrimination
by
either
of
the
defendant
judges.
the
allegations
regarding
the
setting
of
bonds
and
the
payment
for
jury
trails,
do
not
state
the
respondents
are
treated
differently
than
any
other
persons.
it
is
merely
averred
in
general
terms
that
the
petitioners
follow
an
unofficial
bond
schedule
in
criminal
cases.
no
charge
is
made
as
has
been
done
with
respect
to
sentencing
practices
that
there
exists
discrimination
in
treatment
of
white
and
black
persons.
the
sole
issue
was
drawn
by
the
pleadings
relates
only
to
the
allegation
of
the
judges’
discretionary
role
in
imposing
sentence
on
a
lawfully
convicted
defendant.
the
complaint
is
completely
barren
of
any
factual
averment
involving
the
defendant
judges
and
contains
only
one
allegation
of
discrimination
by
the
judges
and
that
is
relative
to
the
sentencing
practice
and
this
allegation
is
alleged
only
on
information
and
belief.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaints
on
grounds:
one,
that
it
lack
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
clause
seeking
to
have
a
federal
court
substitute
its
judgment
for
the
judgment
of
the
state
judiciary;
and
two,
that
no
regular
performance
of
judicial
officers’
duties,
judicial
immunity,
barred
relief
in
an
action
under
the
civil
rights
act.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
a
two-to-one
decision
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
and
ruled
that
a
federal
court
may
entertain
actions
requiring
federal
supervision
and
regulation
by
mandatory
injunction
over
the
discretion
which
state
court
judges
may
lawfully
exercise
within
the
limits
of
authority
granted
to
them
by
law.
the
court
of
appeals
held,
one,
that
the
complaint
stated
a
clause
of
action
against
these
practitioners
under
the
civil
rights
act
sections
1891,
1981,
excuse
me,
1983
and
perhaps
under
1982;
and
two,
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
did
not
extend
to
the
defendant
judges
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
and
the
ku
klux
klan
act
of
1871
where
injunctive
relief
is
sought.
the
seventh
circuit
recognizing
that
this
holding
created
a
case
of
first
impression
volunteered
guidelines
which
the
federal
district
court
might
follow
in
imposing
upon
the
state
judges
a
system
of
reporting
their
conduct
and
the
disposition
of
their
cases
in
the
district
court.
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
would
permit
the
intimidation
of
state
court
judges
and
would
deprive
the
state
of
an
independent
and
intellectually
free
judicial
system.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
common
law
doctrine
of
providing
civil
judicial
meaning
for
judicial
acts
was
not
abolished
by
the
congressional
civil
rights
amendments,
regardless
of
whether
the
damages
are
mandatory
or
mandatory
damages
are
sought.
this
court
established
before
in
the
classic
case
of
bradley
versus
fisher
which
we
cite
very
extensively
in
our
brief,
that
the
purpose
of
judicial
immunity
is
to
assure
the
independents
of
the
judicial
judgment
by
precluding
personal
jeopardy
of
the
judges
who
might
err.
we
submit
that
the
sanctions
of
the
contempt
are
as
dangerous
to
judicial
independents
as
a
risk
of
a
suit
for
money
damages.
one
cannot
visualize
a
more
dramatic
example
of
judicial
subordination
on
the
spectacle
of
having
a
state
judge
brought
before
a
federal
district
court
on
the
claim
of
injunction
and
put
to
the
ignominity
of
having
to
sit
on
the
witness
stand,
defend
the
integrity
of
his
character
and
his
actions
and
be
subjected
on
cross-examination
to
the
verbal
onslaught
of
a
class
of
people
as
in
this
particular
instance
who
had
never
been
before
that
particular
judge
at
any
time.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no,
i
don’t
say
that
if
the
court
please,
i
don’t
mean
to
lead
that
impression.
judge
dillon
did
review
the
cases
where
injunctions
have
been
granted
and
pointed
out
that
injunctions
had
been
granted
for
the
--
or
prohibitory
type
of
injunction
rather
than
a
mandatory
injunction
which
prohibits
a
court
from
and
in
these
particular
instances
that
they
cite
which
were
ministerial
acts
rather
than
judicial
acts
requiring
judicial
discretion.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no,
sir
we
would
not.
it
would
be
a
prohibitive
act
and
not
the
constant
supervision
where
the
judge
could
be
called
in
to
be
subjected
to
cross-examination.
while
on
that
federal
standards
state
judge
could
compelled
to
recall
his
past
decisions
and
the
reasoning
behind
those
decisions.
for
the
instance
like
the
present
case,
the
judge
may
not
only
be
on
trial
with
respect
to
an
individual
case,
but
for
patterns
and
practices
which
comprised
within
their
purview
many
decisions
extending
through
a
number
of
years.
the
effect
of
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
will
be
to
chill
judicial
discretion
in
disposition
of
the
justice
in
the
state
of
illinois.
in
effect
then,
a
state
judge
will
have
to
look
over
his
shoulder
each
time
he
exercises
his
judicial
discretion
for
fear
that
by
some
nebulous
standard
of
statistical
analysis,
he
has
not
meted
out
justice
in
accordance
with
the
federal
district
judge's
personal
formula.
in
addition,
a
state
judge
would
be
more
likely
to
quantify
or
balance
sentences
or
amounts
of
bail
not
in
accordance
with
what
the
circumstances
are
before
him
or
what
the
circumstances
would
have
warranted,
but
out
of
the
nagging
fear
that
leniency
or
strictness
irrespective
of
whether
deserved
over
a
period
of
time
would
be
interpreted
as
deliberate
discriminatory
conduct.
subjecting
a
state
judge
to
federal
review
each
time
a
dissatisfied,
but
lawfully
committed
defendant
alleges
class
discrimination
which
would
require
federal
judges
to
conduct
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
determine
whether
a
pattern
of
discrimination
existed.
a
judge
operating
under
an
order
not
to
discriminate
in
fixing
bonds
and
sentences
would
find
himself
confronted
with
the
possibility
of
a
federal
contempt
citation
and
the
necessity
to
defend
his
motivation
in
each
case.
the
admonishment
of
this
court
in
the
city
of
greenwood
versus
peacock
would
apply
to
this
case
equally
as
well.
but
the
burden
of
the
federal
system
would
be
in
the
least
cumbersome
and
severe.
the
effect
on
the
state
system
would
be
to
create
in
the
press
of
atmosphere
of
federal
supervision
and
perhaps
render
it
impotent.
the
action
countenance
by
the
court
below
would
result
in
the
federal
court
sitting
not
only
in
review
of
state
discretionary
decisions,
but
also
as
the
appellate
tribunal
passing
ultimate
judgment
on
state
criminal
proceedings.
we
hold
this
--
the
action
sanction
here
is
civil
that
requires
the
review
of
past
criminal
decisions.
in
addition,
the
likelihood
of
a
great
similar
class
actions
would
be
taken
to
the
district
courts
from
state
criminal
actions
on
the
ground
that
the
judge
will
or
has
a
propensity
to
discriminate
against
a
particular
group.
the
result
would
be
to
exchange
state
remedies
in
favor
of
district
court
review.
extending
the
possibility
of
sanction
by
this
court
below
to
its
most
absurd
result,
a
state
court
judge
could
literally
spend
so
much
time
defending
his
actions
in
frivolous
suits
in
the
federal
bar,
that
he
could
not
perform
his
state
judicial
duties.
again,
an
admonishment
from
the
city
of
peacock
--
or
city
of
greenwood
versus
peacock
case.
it
must
be
noted
that
the
decision
of
the
courts
of
appeal
for
the
seventh
circuit
does
not
limit
its
holding
to
lower
state
court
judges.
indeed,
the
application
of
the
seventh
circuit
court’s
decision
renders
all
state
judges
subject
to
injunctive
relief
should
some
class
allege
that
they
have
engaged
in
patterns
and
practices
which
they
feel
violate
their
civil
rights.
therefore,
this
decision
if
it
allowed
to
remain
in
effect
could
easily
propel
a
rash
of
federal
injunctive
proceedings
against
state
appellate
court
based
upon
the
naked
allegation
that
the
appellate
justices
or
any
combination
of
them
engaged
in
patterns
and
practices
of
conduct
inimical
to
the
civil
rights
of
the
complaining
class.
the
unfitting
bowl
given
to
judicial
immunity
doctrine
by
the
seventh
circuit
court
irrevocably
alters
the
historic
relationship
that
has
existed
between
the
courts
of
equity
and
the
lower
courts,
between
the
federal
state
--
federal
courts
and
the
state
courts,
and
between
the
judge
and
those
persons
appearing
before
him.
the
effect
of
permitting
actions
against
the
state
judiciary
going
out
of
the
exercise
of
lawful
discretion
would
be
too
irreparably
harm
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
at
the
state
level.
we
submit
that
no
intellectually
independent
state
judiciary
could
survive
in
an
atmosphere
of
hostile
litigants
and
the
constant
federal
supervision.
we
believe
that
the
question
of
judicial
immunity
had
been
of
question
of
whether
judicial
immunity
had
been
abolished
by
the
civil
rights
act
was
answered
by
this
court
in
pierson
versus
ray
which
we
cite
in
our
brief
that
this
court
held
that
the
common
law
immunity
of
judges
from
civil
action
for
acts
committed
within
their
judicial
discretion
was
so
subtle
a
principle
as
to
be
accepted
from
the
provisions
of
section
1983.
furthermore,
this
court
in
pierson
considered
the
same
legislative
history
which
the
court
below
held
to
be
so
incisive
and
found
that
history
a
warning.
so
much
so,
that
the
case
states
that
gives
no
clear
indication
that
congress
meant
to
abolish
wholesale,
all
common
law
immunities.
mr.
chief
justice
warren
expressed
the
feelings
of
eight
members
of
that
court
when
he
wrote.
“we
presume
that
congress
would
have
specifically
so
provide
had
it
wished
to
abolish
this
doctrine.”
nothing
in
the
explicit
language
of
pierson
affords
a
basis
to
limit
that
holding
to
money
damages
especially
in
the
light
of
the
chief
justice
compelling
language
which
draws
no
distinction
between
monetary
and
equable
relief.
he
said
it
at
page
554,
“it
is
a
judges’
duty
to
decide
all
cases
within
his
jurisdiction
which
are
brought
before
him,
including
controversial
cases
which
arouse
the
most
intense
feelings
in
litigants.
his
errors
maybe
corrected
on
appeal,
but
he
should
not
have
to
feel
that
unsatisfied
litigants
may
hound
him
with
litigation
charging
him
with
malice
or
corruption.
imposing
such
a
burden
on
judges
would
contribute
not
too
principle
and
fearless
decision
making
but
to
intimidation.”
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
court
draws
the
narrow
distinction
that
while
judges
are
immune
from
damage
suits,
they
maybe
subjected
to
a
mandatory
injunction
if
ever
anyone
should
charge
them
in
the
federal
courts
with
class
discrimination.
the
defendant
judges
submit
that
no
distinction
can
logically
be
made
as
to
judicial
immunity
between
damages
and
an
injunctive
order
for
a
judge’s
lawful
exercise
of
his
discretion.
the
decision
of
the
two-man
majority
in
the
court
below
is
well-written.
but
we
submit
at
a
careful
reading
of
the
decisions
cited
by
the
seventh
circuit
wherein
injunctive
relief
has
been
granted,
would
reveal
that
these
cases
either
deal
with
ministerial
duties
exercised
by
a
judicial
office
or
the
cases
do
not
discuss
the
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity
or
ex
parte
proceedings
in
which
the
accused
judge
didn’t
participate
are
based
upon
the
misapprehension
of
other
decisions
utilized
as
precedents.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
there
is
a
difference
if
the
court
please.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
well,
there,
there
is
the
prohibitory
injunction
again
and
here
the
injunction
has
come
down
from
the
seventh
circuit
as
a
mandatory
type
of
thing.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no,
sir.
not
in
pierson.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
it
has
been
distinguished
in
the
various
courts
but
we
indicate
that
the
essence
of
the
rule
of
judicial
immunity
is
the
freedom
of
judge
from
the
threat
of
individual
punishment
in
the
event
that
a
different
court
should
decide
that
its
judgment
wasn’t
correct
in
the
first
place.
and
we
maintain
it’s
unrelated
to
the
nature
of
the
suit
whether
it’s
a
civil
right
action
or
whether
it’s
a
individual
action
or
it’s
an
action
brought
by
an
individual
or
by
a
class.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
well,
we
maintained
there
is
a
scope
of
limited
argument
here
too.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
both
of
them,
if
the
court
please.
we
are
arguing
judicial
immunity,
we
are
also
argued
in
scope
of
the
remedy.
we
also
make
the
additional
argument
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
a
prohibitory
injunction?
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
which
prohibits
him
from
a
doing
a
certain
acts,
yes
certainly.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
i
would
concede
that,
yes
sir.
to
not
to
handle
certain
case
or
not
performing
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
not
the
former
ministerial
duty.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
sir.
i
would
say
that
in
the
scope
of
the
order
of
the
seventh
circuit
which
requires
a
constant
supervision
of
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
not
as
far
as
the
defendant
judges
are
concerned.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
even
if
all
the
facts
were
true,
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
the
remedy
is
here
if
the
court
please,
there
is
no
specific
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
there
is
no
specific
allegation
against
either
one
of
these
judges
as
to
a
discriminatory
act
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
it’s
merely
conclusionary
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no,
there
are
number
of
remedy
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
there
is
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes
sir
because
they
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes
sir,
there
would
be
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
it’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
it
would
be,
except
that
we
wanted
to
get
into
the
question
of
judicial
immunity
because
we
feel
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
sir.
if
i
can
just
get
back
to
justice
marshall’s
question.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
i
say
there's
not,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
right.
there
is
also
the
--
to
get
back
to
justice
marshall’s
question
there’s
ample
provision
for
a
review
in
our
appellate
courts.
if
the
judge
where
to
be
as
discriminatory
as
you
point
out
there
is
also
the
question
of
the
illinois
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
no,
sir
i
don’t
have
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
i
don’t
have
one.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
also
to
get
to
the
question
of
the
--
constitution
of
the
united
states
provides
an
article
4,
section
4
that
the
united
states
shall
guarantee
to
every
state,
a
republican
form
of
government,
essential
to
the
concept
of
republican
form
of
government
is
the
state
judiciary
remain
free
to
pass
upon
its
own
laws
without
fear
of
district
court’s
surveillance.
where
a
pattern
emerges
or
is
allowed
to
emerge
that
the
state
judicial
officers
can
be
summoned
before
a
federal
district
court
on
the
mere
allegation
that
they
engaged
in
the
patterns
and
practices
of
conduct
somehow
inimical
to
the
class
then
the
obvious
result
would
be
the
destruction
of
the
state
judiciary
and
thereby
the
republican
form
of
government.
if
the
court
please,
i’d
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
thank
you,
your
honor.
if
the
court
please
again,
we
would
like
bring
out
that
nowhere
in
the
complaint
as
the
court
has
indicated
in
asking
the
questions,
do
we
find
that
any
plaintiff
that
has
been
named
has
been
brought
before
this
court,
has
been
charged,
bailed,
or
sentenced.
furthermore,
there
is
not
one
single
instance
pleaded
within
the
complaint
of
discriminatory
practice.
counsel
has
indicated
that
there
has
been
a
pattern
and
practice
over
the
years
of
discriminatory
conduct,
it
could
be
very
easily
shown
that
if
there
is
such
a
pattern
or
practice
that
are
individual
instances,
that
there
are
differences
between
the
pattern
sentencing
between
white
and
blacks,
we
submit
that
we
read
the
complaint
as
far
as
the
sentencing
charge
not
that
there
is
a
discrimination
between
white
and
black
persons
as
far
as
bail
is
concerned,
but
that
only
that
they
use
unofficial
bond
schedule
in
criminal
cases
and
that
solely
it.
we
also
submit
that
the
allegations
as
have
been
charged
here
in
a
civil
rights
case
that
the
holdings
of
the
courts
have
been
that
in
civil
rights
action
the
pleadings
must
be
specific
in
the
case
people
ex
rel
holf
versus
ballinger
(ph)
is
such
a
case
that
hold
that
these
pleadings
be
specific.
we
maintain
that
nowhere
in
any
of
the
pleadings
and
nowhere
in
the
argument
has
there
been
any
allegation
made
that
these
particular
judges,
o’shea
and
spomer
have
been
guilty
of
a
discriminatory
act
relative
to
white
and
black
persons.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
they
have
already
amended
once
if
the
court
please
and
we
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
well,
that
might
be
possible.
i
don’t
know.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
we
think
that
if
they
got
specific
as
far
as
the
state’s
attorney
berbling
is
concerned
and
point
out
specific
acts
of
discrimination.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
i
would
say
that
in
those
specific
instances
if
there
where
such
specific
instance
that
the
remedies
we
have
within
our
state
court
system
would
be
able
to
take
care
of
that.
we
also
point
out
that
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
that’s
possible.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes
sir.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
this
goes
with
the
argument
i
started
to
make
if
the
court
please
that
if
they
got
specific
in
11
specific
instances
as
far
as
the
state’s
attorney
is
concerned
that
they
could
very
easily
have
gotten
specific
as
far
as
the
judges’
concerned.
as
the
matter
of
fact
those
11
specific
instances,
there's
not
once
instance
there
where
any
of
the
key
parties
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
well,
that’s
one
of
the
issues
that
if
the
court
please,
the
underlying
--
the
most
important
issue
we
can
contend
is
the
underlying
issue
of
the
state
supervision
by
the
federal
district
court
on
a
continuing
basis.
if
there
are
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
yes,
sir.
that’s
correct.
both
for
money
damages
and
from
the
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
--
the
relief
as
far
as
a
mandatory
type
of
action
--
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
i
would
say
so.
mr.
robert
j.
o’rourke
and
if
there
are
no
further
question,
we
would
ask
that
based
upon
these
reasons
that
the
judgment
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
be
reversed
as
to
these
defendant
judges
and
that
this
honorable
court
hold
that
the
doctrine
of
the
judicial
immunity
would
apply
in
the
mandatory
injunction
cases.
thank
you,
your
honor.
