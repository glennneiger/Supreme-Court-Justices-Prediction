justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
at
this
point,
who
would
be
entitled
under
your
definition
of
the
class
or
classes
here
to
come
in
and
request
a
contempt
citation
for
the
judge?
your
class
has
defined
that
all
financially
poor
persons
and
as
all
--
oh,
let's
see.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
all
black
citizens.
but
a
rather
extensive
and
amorphous
class
is,
and
i'm
sure
you
would
agree,
that
mean
any
black
citizen
in
cairo
or
anybody
who
could
prove
he
was
relatively
poor,
could
request
us
a
contempt
citation
mr.
wiseman?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
but
who
would
enforce
that?
who
would
act
to
request
a
contempt
citation
for
a
judge?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what's
the
population
of
cairo?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
percentage
roughly
would
you
estimate
would
be
categorized
as
financially
poor?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
obviously
you
have
a
serious
problem
there.
certainly,
no
one
would
minimize
that,
but
the
legal
problem
is
who
would
enforce
such
a
decree,
would
it
be
2,000
or
3,000
people
or
--?
