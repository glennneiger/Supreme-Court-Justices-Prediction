you
may

chief

mr.
o’rourke,
just
to
help
me
at
least
to
keep
this
cast
of
characters
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
which
is
rather
extensive
here,
clearly
in
mind.
the
present
prosecutor
against
whom
a
part
of
this
injunctive
relief
is
directed
was
not
in
office
at
the
time
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
the
case
began
and
berbling,
the
man
who
allegedly
committed
all
these
acts
is
out
of
office,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
may
i
interrupt
you
once
more?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
clear
from
your
point
of
view
at
least
that
none
of
the
allegations
against
spomer,
the
present
district
attorney,
that
are
no
allegations
of
misconduct
against
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
that
predecessor
and
no
one
else?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
this
is
injunctive
relief
running
against
an
office
rather
than
a
person
is?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
how
could
--
chief

very

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
counsel,
you
don’t
want
us
to
decide
a
case
on
the
basis
of
the
judicial
notice
that
judges
in
chicago
take
up
some
things
that
are
going
on
in
illinois,
do
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
given
the
--
what
you
just
suggested
about
the
flexibility
and
liberality
of
pleading
under
the
federal
rules,
i'm
surprised
you
don’t
argue
that
what
your
complaint
says
when
you
refer
to
plaintiffs
that
it
should
be
read
as
meaning
the
plaintiffs
and
each
of
the
plaintiffs
or
that
there
is
an
implied
adjective
each
plaintiff
and
then
at
least
we
get
on
to
the
heart
of
some
of
the
other
problems
in
the
case.
i'm
not
sure
that
solves
your
problem,
but
we’ve
got
a
lot
of
important
points
here
beside
the
one
the
importance
on
what
we've
been
discussing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
that
be
less
so
you
get
to
trial
on
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
haven’t
suggested
us
yet,
at
least,
i
don’t
think
i
heard
you
say
that
just
as
yet,
why
the
appellate
courts
of
the
state
of
illinois
can’t
deal
with
this
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
have
supervisory
power
under
the
illinois’
constitution
and
practice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
haven’t
they
exercised
supervisory
power
in
such
cases?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don’t
you
characterize
this
as
misbehavior
of
the
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
don’t
you
think
that
there
are
some,
under
federal
concepts
of
federalism,
there
some
obligation
to
find
that
out
first?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
wiseman.
mr.
o’rourke
you
have
5
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
this
--
what
do
you
want
to
say
about
the
suggestion
i
made
to
counsel
after
the
reading
and
the
pleadings
the
way
we
tend
to
read
them
in
the
federal
--
under
the
federal
rules
that
plaintiffs
means
each
plaintiff?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
of
course
that’s
all
speculation
about
whether
they
can,
but
if
we
were
to
read
this
complaint
as
meaning
each
plaintiff,
do
you
regard
this
is
the
large
issue
in
this
case,
the
pleading
issue
or
is
the
underlying
issue
more
important?
