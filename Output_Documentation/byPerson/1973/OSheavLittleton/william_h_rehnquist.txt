mr.

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
i
understand
the
argument,
you’re
making
out
--
you
go
beyond
really
a
position
that
judge
dillon
took
in
dissent.
as
i
understood
his
dissent,
he
would
not
say
categorically
that
you
could
never
have
an
injunction
under
1983
against
a
judicial
officer,
but
that
in
this
particular
type
of
situation
you
couldn’t
have
it,
but
you
say,
you
can
never
have
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
there
you
wouldn’t
have
the
overhanging
threat
of
a
contempt
citation
in
your
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
if
a
state
court
judge
is
enjoined
along
the
line
of
justice
white’s
question
from
carrying
out
of
certain
prosecution
even
though,
he
may
be
enjoin
by
name
there's
no
doubt
as
to
what
is
duty
as
under
the
terms
of
that
injunction.
he
must
simply
desist
unless
it’s
reversed
by
the
higher
court.
whereas
what
you
are
complaining
about
here,
i
take
it,
is
the
constant
oversight
of
the
discretion
and
in
cases
unnamed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
two
appendix.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that’s
in
the
berbling
complaint?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
can
see
though
our
problem
can’t
you
mr.
wiseman,
here
the
seventh
circuit
has
decided
some
very
complex
legal
questions
and
your
complaint
is
at
best
it
seems
to
me
ambiguous
as
to
whether
any
of
your
particular
plaintiffs
in
the
judges’
case
has
actually
suffered
these
deprivations
themselves?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wiseman,
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
you
don’t
within
the
limits
of
your
complaint
allege
any
efforts
to
pursue
state
court
remedies
such
as
appeal?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don’t
you
think
that
at
least
there
is
a
possibility
that
if
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
repeatedly
reversed
these
judges
and
that
they
were
saying
that
they
were
in
fact
guilty
of
what
you
charge
them
with
that
they
would
stop
doing
that?m
