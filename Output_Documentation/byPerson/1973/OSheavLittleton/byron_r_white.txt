justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
federal
court
adjoining
a
state
criminal
proceeding
in
a
1983
action
--
1983
action
in
federal
court
alleging
that
the
state
criminal
proceeding
deprives
the
defendant
of
some
constitutional
right,
alleging
harassment
or
a
false
charge
or
something
like
that,
dombrowski
type
of
situation,
and
the
federal
court
holding
within
the
wholly
consistently
with
the
younger,
enjoins
the
state
criminal
prosecution.
now,
you
say
that
the
prosecution
can
be
enjoined,
but
not
the
judge?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
can
just
work
on
the
parties?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
something
in
--
nothing
in
pierson
that
says
that
prohibitory
injunction
can
be
entered
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
distinguish
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
doesn’t
sound
much
like
an
immunity
argument.
it
sounds
like
a
scope
of
the
remedy
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
you
are
now
making
it
sounds
to
me
like.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
do
you
concede
that
the
judge
is
not
a
immune
from
a
--
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
to
identify
but
you
concede
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
do
concede
there’s
a
case
of
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
see
there
is
a
case
--
constitutional
case
of
controversy
alleged
in
these
actions?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
about
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case?
did
they
allege
a
some
concrete
case
of
controversy
that
federal
court
should
have
entertained?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
it
is
–
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about,
but
you
would
at
least
insist
that
one
of
the
negroes
who
was
--
who
suffered
from
a
discriminatory
sentence
be
a
plaintiff?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
wouldn't
any
member
of
the
public
bringing
the
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that’s
--
and
then
here
it’s
just
any
members
of
public,
isn’t
it?
in
the
sense
that
none
of
these
particular
plaintiffs
as
ever
suffered
any
kind
of
sentence
are
wrong
from
these
judges?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
isn’t
that
you
special
argument
in
these
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
wanted
it,
but
we
have
a
jurisdictional
problem
at
the
outset?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don’t
want
to
get
back
to
that
yet.
i
just
wonder,
do
you
concede
there's
a
case
of
controversy
or
not
or
do
you
say
there
is
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
we
disagree
with
you
then
you
make
your
argument
about
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
--
of
the
main
plaintiffs
which
one
suffered
from
this
alleged
practices?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
the
main
plaintiff
not
the
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
intentionally
and
willingly?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
--
would
the
act
she
want
him
to
--
the
judge
to
be
enjoined
from
performing
via
crime
under
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
case
of
the
use
of
race
to
impose
a
higher
penalty
is
a
crime,
isn’t
it?
and
then,
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
him
under
threat
of
a
contempt
if
they
do
to
try
out
on
a
contempt
action
whenever
you
might
want
to
claim
that
he
has
used
race
in
imposition
of
a
sentence.
justice
byron
r.
white
intentionally
and
knowingly?
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume
now
that
a
state
criminal
prosecution
is
pending
against
one
or
more
the
named
plaintiffs
at
the
time
you
filed
this
action
and
you
could
have
raised
these
claims
in
that
state
prosecution?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
that
you’ve
say
that
all
these
plaintiffs
except
i
don’t
know
that
you
claim
this
about
the
white
plaintiffs,
but
let’s
assume
that
all
these
plaintiffs
you
allege
were
involved
in
a
criminal
prosecution
insofar
as
the
allegations
against
the
judge
is
concerned
they
must
have
been
and
they
must
have
been,
you
claim
that
they
were
discriminated
against
in
there
criminal
prosecutions?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
could’ve
raised
these
very
claims
in
those
state
criminal
prosecutions?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
a
class
action
like
this
where
you
look
into
the
future
is
another
exception
to
the
younger
against
harris.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
in
a
pattern?
justice
byron
r.
white
these
cases
were
begun
in
the
district
court
under
a
single
complaint
claiming
jurisdiction
under
title
42,
section
1983.
in
number
72-953,
the
o’shea
case,
relief
was
sought
against
the
alleged
racially
discriminatory
practices
of
two
local
state
judges
in
the
course
of
exercising
the
criminal
jurisdiction
in
first
event.
in
72-955,
with
spomer
case,
relief
was
sought
against
the
alleged
racially
discriminatory
practices
of
the
local
county
prosecutor.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
from
one
of
jurisdiction
to
grant
the
injunctive
relief
sought.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
reversed,
holding
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction,
that
the
defendants
were
not
immune
from
suit,
and
that
injunctive
relief,
properly
conceived,
was
an
available
remedy
if
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
were
proved.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
o’shea
case.
the
complaint
did
not
adequately
allege
a
case
of
controversy
within
the
jurisdictions
of
the
district
court,
nor
did
it
allege
the
rudiments
of
the
case
for
injunctive
relief.
in
the
spomer
case,
it
appears
that
after
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
filed,
the
prosecuting
attorney
named
in
the
complaint
was
succeeded
by
another
as
a
result
of
the
1972
elections.
we
accordingly
vacate
the
judgment
and
remand
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
determine
in
the
light
of
this
fact
whether
there’s
still
a
live
controversy
in
this
case.
in
the
o’shea
case,
mr.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
and
in
part
one
of
the
court’s
opinion.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
brennan
and
marshall
have
joined.
