she
--
the
allegations

did

not?
justice

brennan,

and
also
as
to
magistrate
o’shea?
justice
william

so
in

case
at

the
injunction
runs
against
people
based

their
alleged
misconduct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
19
named
plaintiffs.
are
you
suggesting
at
that
is
an
allegation
of
each
of
the
19
was
involved
either
in
bonding
business
or
sentencing
or
something?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
the
main
plaintiffs
are
19
in
number.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
each
of
the
19
was
affected
by
the
conduct
of
one
or
the
other?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
involved
in
some
criminal
charge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
each
of
the
19?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
this
pleading
is
not
specific
enough,
what
about
its
amendment?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
about
amending
the
second
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
that’s
against
the
judges
as
i
understand
mr.
wiseman’s
argument
and
they
have
the
information
which
would
identify
which
named
plaintiffs
were
affected
by
which
of
the
defendant
judges,
so
he
told
us?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that’s
another
argument,
but
as
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
as
for
the
sufficiency
of
the
pleadings
what
he
in
effect
told
us
i
gather
is
it
he
could
amend
this
to
specify
everything?
justice

so
he
said,
yes.
