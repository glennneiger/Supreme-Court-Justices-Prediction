mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
do
not
bring
this
lawsuit
frivolously.
we
have
made
serious
and
grave
charges
here.
we
are
making
those
charges
consistent
with
our
responsibility
under
rule
11
of
the
federal
rules
for
civil
procedure.
that
rule
requires
that
before
an
attorney
sign
a
pleading,
he
have
--
he
must
have
good
grounds
for
it.
we
have
such
grounds
here.
there
has
been
a
fundamental
breakdown
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
cairo,
illinois.
what
we
are
charging
here
is
that
these
defendants
engaged
in
a
pattern
and
practice
of
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
against
these
plaintiffs
and
blacks
similarly
situated
in
cairo,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
lawsuit
where
the
black
citizens
of
cairo.
we
seek
equitable
relief
only
against
these
judges.
we
do
not
seek
damages.
we
seek
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
several
of
them
have,
your
honor.
we
did
not
specifically
alleged
which
one,
instead
what
we
alleged
was
that
we
are
seeking
to
enjoin
the
depravation
of
plaintiffs
of
their
class
rights,
that
was
in
paragraph
one
in
a
number
of
the
paragraphs
in
our
complaint.
we
have
indicated
that
the
plaintiffs
and
others
have
been
deprived
of
their
rights.
we
do
not
specifically
list
out
the
individuals
but
if
we
have
to
we
could.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
they
were
deprived
in
the
one,
an
unofficial
bond
schedule
is
used
when
the
defendant
is
obliged.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
your
honor
but
we
have
not
specifically
named
them
in
the
complaint.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
because
we
have
named
in
general
in
the
allegation
that
the
plaintiffs
have
individually
been
deprived
of
the
rights
that
we
further
alleged.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
it
includes,
the
named
plaintiffs
in
the
class
are
the
black
persons
in
cairo
who
have
been
--
who
were
similarly
situated
in
a
--
who
have
been
similarly
deprived
of
the
kinds
of
rights
that
we
are
alleging
here.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
it
would
be
a
class
--
it
would
be
basically
the
black
persons
of
cairo.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes.
all
they
actually
--
well,
the
class
is
specified
in
our
complaint
as
those
who
are
similarly
situated.
only
those
who
are
similarly
been
deprived
of
rights
as
the
named
plaintiffs.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
in
paragraphs
1,
we
state
that
this
is
a
civil
action
insofar
as
the
judges
are
concerned
for
equitable
relief.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
page

your
honor.
to
enjoin
the
deprivation
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
paragraph
1
of
the
appendix.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
well,
your
honor
in
the
paragraph
1
of
the
complaint
which
is
on
page
15,
we
indicate,
we
allege
that
the
plaintiffs
and
members
of
their
class
have
been
deprived
of
certain
rights.
in
paragraph
3,
we
state
under
paragraph
3
(a),
the
plaintiffs
are
black
citizens
of
the
city
of
cairo
with
two
exceptions
and
we
name
the
two
exceptions.
in
paragraph
(b)
we
say,
they
bring
this
option
as
a
class
in
action
individually
and
on
behalf
of
other
similar
situated.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
your
honor,
the
lawsuit
was
originally
filed
against
six
defendants.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
i
understand.
i
am
getting
to
that
point
in
that
when
we
filed
against
six
defendants
and
we
named
the
number
of
plaintiffs
that
we
named
the
number
of
plaintiffs
that
we
have,
some
of
the
charges
go
to
the
state’s
attorney
so
that
some
of
the
plaintiffs
named
were
only
affected
by
the
state’s
attorney’s
conduct.
other
of
the
plaintiffs
were
only
affected
by
the
conduct
of
the
judges.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
either
a
criminal
charge
or
in
the
case
of
the
states
attorney
that
he
sought
to
have
relief
in
the
criminal
courts
which
been
denied.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
your
honor
and
the
i
would
submit
that
we
are
intending
by
our
allegation
on
page
15
of
paragraph
and
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
we
--
in
paragraph
3
(c),
which
would
encompass
in
the
language
of
that
paragraph
the
named
plaintiffs
as
well.
we
are
saying
who
have
on
account
of
their
race
and
because
of
there
exercise
of
first
amendment
right,
having
the
past
and
continued
to
be
subjected
to
the
unconstitutional
and
selectively
discriminatory
enforcement
in
administration
of
criminal
justice.
later
on
in
our
complaint,
we
specify
the
kind
of
conduct
we
are
referring
to
that
the
judges
engage
in
that
they
on
account
of
race
deprived
the
plaintiffs
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
paragraph
35
your
honor
of
the
complaint
at
page
29
i
believe
of
the
appendix
we
state,
with
respect
to
the
judges
that
they
have
deprived
and
continue
to
deprive
plaintiffs
and
members
of
their
class
of
the
rights
to
due
process
and
then
process
and
then
in
fourteenth
amendment
and
then
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
but
we
are
talking
about
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
in
paragraph
36,
we
are
not
referring
to
denied
bail,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
what
i
meant
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
no,
they
are
discriminated
in
the
setting
of
bail
and
that
these
judges
were
all
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
paragraph
36
your
honor
“a”
we
say,
in
a
preface
to
a
that
the
judges
have
denied
and
continued
to
denied
to
plaintiffs
and
members
of
their
class,
the
constitutional
rights
in
the
following
ways
and
then
“a”
is
our
bail
situation,
where
they
--
the
judges
are
following
a
non-official
bond
schedule
that
has
been
established
to
apply
the
blacks.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
under
“b”
your
honor
refers
to
the
sentences.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
the
problem
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
the
problem
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
no,
your
honor.
the
reason
we
alleged
the
way
we
did
is
that
the
plaintiffs
and
members
of
their
class
have
been
sentenced
in
--
they
believe
and
we
believe
to
a
longer
term
than
whites.
to
prove
that
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
your
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
if
your
--
your
honor,
i
submit
that
we
have
in
general
covered
that
by
stating
the
plaintiffs.
when
we
are
filing
a
lawsuit
against
six
defendants,
we
did
not
break
it
down
as
to
which
plaintiffs
where
affected
by
the
conduct
of
which
defendant
except
with
respect
to
the
state’s
attorney
and
mr.
shepherd.
i
would
submit
that
if
in
the
liberal
ruling
--
reading
of
the
rules
for
pleading
that
we
have
covered
it,
but
if
not,
then
we
should
have
a
right
to
amend
our
complaint
because
we
can
specify
the
individuals
who
have
been
directly
affected
by
name
if
we
have
to.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
they
are.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes.
manker
harris
for
example
is
a
named
plaintiff,
every
single
one
of
them
is
a
named
plaintiff.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
james
martin
is
a
plaintiff,
james
wilson
is
a
plaintiff.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes
but,
your
honor,
we
have
filed
simply
one
complaint
which
covered
all
of
the
defendants.
i
submit
your
honor
that
a
--
we
have
pleaded
the
essential
allegations
for
an
action
under
these
statutes.
we
have
stated
that
these
plaintiffs
have
been
discriminated
against.
we’ve
stated
that
the
defendants
have
acted
under
color
of
state
law,
customer
usage.
we
stated
that
the
plaintiffs
have
been
deprived
of
certain
enumerated
rights
and
as
stated
specifically
the
kinds
of
rights
we’re
talking
about
with
respect
to
the
judges.
the
setting
of
bond
in
which
they
use
unofficial
bond
schedule;
the
setting
of
sentences
in
which
they
sentenced
blacks
the
longer
terms
than
whites;
and
the
imposition
of
a
jury
fee
in
certain
kinds
of
cases
which
are
not
imposed
upon
against
whites.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
i
think
your
honor,
one
way
the
seventh
circuit
handled
that
with
respect
to
some
of
our
allegations
going
to
mr.
berbling,
whose
petition
is
pending
before
this
court
is
that
that
we
could
have
the
right
to
amend
our
complaint
if
necessary,
if
the
district
court
found
that
it
was
necessary
in
that
context.
i
think
it
is
important
that
the
seventh
circuit
is
extremely
cognizant
of
what’s
going
on
in
cairo.
cairo
is
located
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
i
don’t
think
it
is
necessary
your
honor
because
i
think
in
our
complaint
we
have
alleged
in
part
what
is
happening
in
cairo
that
there
is
a
considerable
amount
of
tension
between
whites
and
blacks.
it
is
located
--
because
of
its
location
it
has
had
a
history
of
civil
strife
that
since
the
1960s,
these
plaintiffs
have
been
striving
to
obtain
equal
opportunity
and
employment,
in
housing
and
in
participation
in
governmental
affairs.
this
is
created
strife
in
the
community
and
to
the
local
officials
who
--
if
they
applied
the
law
even
handedly
could
help
the
problem
instead
of
exacerbated
it
and
they
engage
in
this
pattern
and
practice
of
discrimination.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
your
honor
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
right.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
i
believe
i
would
adopt
the
language
that
you
are
suggesting,
your
honor.
we
--
i
believe
we've
stated
a
claim
under
the
statutes
in
that
section
1981
provides
that
all
persons
shall
be
subject
to
light
punishments,
penalties,
and
exceptions
as
white
persons.
that
congress
at
the
time
they
pass
the
statute
must
have
been
considering
judges
who
would
be
ones
who
would
be
subjecting
persons
to
punishments,
penalties,
and
exceptions.
i
don’t
believe
that
the
judicial
immunity
applies
to
judges
when
we
are
talking
about
suits
and
equity.
the
case
of
bradley
versus
fisher
that
is
so
heavily
relied
upon
by
the
petitioners
is
not
applicable
to
this
case.
first,
it
was
not
decided
under
the
civil
rights
statutes.
second,
it
was
an
action
in
damages.
third,
it
was
isolated
case
involving
a
judge
--
a
lawyer
who
had
been
taking
off
the
roles
of
attorneys
and
indeed,
the
court
in
giving
the
broad
language
that
it
did
as
to
the
independence
of
the
judiciary
in
that
decision
could
not
augment
that
it
applied
to
judges
when
we
are
talking
about
suits
in
equity
because
at
the
same
time
that
it
decided
that
case,
it
decided
a
case
of
ex
parte
bradley
which
is
at
7
wallace
364
and
in
that
case
the
united
states
supreme
court
issued
a
writ
of
mandamus
to
the
then
supreme
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
compelling
that
court
to
restore
mr.
bradley
to
the
roles
of
attorneys.
this
court’s
decision
was
recently
last
term
in
mitchum
versus
foster
decided
the
question
as
to
whether
a
federal
court
could
issue
an
injunction
against
a
judge.
one
of
the
defendants
in
that
case
was
a
judge.
the
court
granted
in
remanding
that
case
to
the
lower
court
suggested
that
it
should
consider
the
question
of
comity
in
our
federalism
and
equity,
but
in
terms
of
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity,
it
is
clear
that
an
injunction
can
extend
to
a
judge.
we
are
not
asking
a
court
to
infringe
upon
the
lawful
discretionary
action
of
a
judge.
what
we
are
asking
this
--
a
court
to
do
is
prohibit
a
judge
from
doing
that
which
she
has
no
right
to
do.
we've
simple
asked
that
a
judge
--
that
these
judges
be
enjoined
from
using
race
as
criterion
in
the
exercise
of
their
office.
we've
not
asked
the
court
to
tell
the
judge
what
sentence
he
must
impose.
we've
not
asked
the
court
to
tell
the
judge
which
bond
he
must
impose.
we
have
simply
said
that
he
cannot
use
race
as
a
factor
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
and
willfully
and
in
a
pattern
and
practice
case.
we
--
some
of
the
charges
that
we
have
do
not
involve
the
exercise
of
discretion
at
all.
with
respect
to
the
use
of
a
non-official
bond
schedule,
there's
no
discretion
involved.
what
we
are
talking
here
is
it,
when
a
black
appears
before
the
judge,
he
says,
oh,
if
the
defendants
are
black,
the
bond
for
him
will
be
this
because
he
has
a
set
bond
schedule
for
blacks.
we
are
not
talking
about
the
judge
using
weighing
the
various
factors
to
determine
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
i
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
i
believe
it
would
be
under
the
prin
--
but
i'm
not
sure
of
that
your
honor.
i
had
not
considered
that
through
in
this
case.
we
do
not
have
alternative
remedies
against
the
judge
because
one,
there's
no
right
of
damages
against
the
judge;
two,
there's
a
no
way
of
solving
the
problem
in
the
appellate
courts
of
illinois.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
pattern
and
practice.
we
are
not
seeking
to
enjoin
a
pending
state
proceeding.
we
are
seeking
to
terminate
this
pattern
and
practice
of
these
judges.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
it
would
not
be
reflected
in
the
record.
i
think
the
problem
though
i
forward
on
a
case-by-case
basis
are
several.
one,
that
in
order
to
prove
the
charge
of
sentencing
on
a
pattern
and
practice
based
considerable
discovery
is
necessary.
it
involves
a
considerable
amount
of
resources
to
inspect
court
documents
and
police
documents
and
then
computerize
them
to
come
out
with
your
prima
facie
case.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
it
will
not
be
less
so
on
this
case,
but
if
we
prevail
on
this
case
and
prove
our
facts
that
should
end
the
problem.
if
you
had
it
on
the
case-by-case
basis,
then
the
next
defendant
would
have
to
do
the
same
thing
and
you
would
continue
on
infinitum.
moreover,
it
would
not
prevent
the
on
going
discrimination
that
is
occurring.
part
of
the
discrimination
that
we
allege
is
--
we
allege
has
an
effect
on
the
participation
of
these
plaintiffs
in
peaceful
parades
against
the
racially
discriminatory
practices
of
merchants
in
public
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
no,
your
honor.
we
are
not
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
no.
what
we
are
seeking
is
very
simple
that
the
judge
not
be
permitted
to
use
race
as
a
criterion
in
administering
the
law
with
respect
to
bail,
and
sentencing
and
the
imposition
of
jury
fees.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
your
honor,
that’s
right
but
in
--
we
are
charging
that
this
judges
have
violated
that
oath.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
i
would
suggest,
one,
that
if
a
judge
does
violate
the
federal
court
order
of
that
nature
intentionally
and
willfully
and
not
inadvertently,
then
he
should
be
subjected
to
the
contempt
powers
of
the
court.
second,
i
would
suggest,
we
could
not
go
into
the
federal
court
on
a
show
cause
order
simply
on
isolated
instance.
since
we
are
pleading
a
pattern
and
practice
case
in
order
for
us
to
show
a
violation
of
the
court’s
order,
we
would
again
have
to
show
a
pattern
and
practice
case.
so,
we
are
not
talking
about
five
instances
where
a
black
may
have
gotten
a
different
sentence
than
a
white.
we
are
going
to
have
show
more
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
federal
court
after
hearing
the
parties,
after
weighing
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
and
evaluating
the
evidence,
would
then
be
able
to
be
in
a
better
position
to
fashion
appropriate
relief
and
he
could
put
certain
limitations
on
our
coming
in
to
find
a
judge
in
contempt.
obviously,
that’s
a
serious
thing,
but
we
are
making
serious
charges
here
and
if
--
the
judge
certainly
would
have
the
power
to
require
us
to
come
in,
to
show
again
a
pattern
and
practice.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
blacks.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
no,
your
honor.
we
would,
one
there
has
been
no
finding
as
to
what
the
class
consist
of
by
the
district
court.
that
finding
would
have
to
be
made
first.
then
presumably,
we
would
have
to
show
here,
assuming
the
district
court
fashion
release
the
strict
limitations,
we’d
have
to
show
a
series
of
persons
who
come
within
the
class
who
have
violate
--
who
have
been
deprived
of
those
rights.
it
would
not
be
an
individual
person
who
could
do
it.
the
individual
--
in
the
individual
case
that
could
be
handled
in
other
means,
but
what
we
are
trying
to
do
is
to
prevent
the
pattern
and
practice
situation
and
the
injunctive
relief
is
--
we
believe
the
most
appropriate
remedy.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
the
named
plaintiffs
and
members
of
the
classes
ultimately
determined
by
the
district
court
could
come
in
again
and
request
that
the
court
issue
a
show
cause
order.
it
would
be
necessary
i
believe
in
the
allegations
for
a
filing
of
contempt
that
he
alleged
that
a
series
of
people
have
been
deprived
again
in
violation
of
the
court’s
order.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
it
is
a
population
of
6,000
people
approximately,
35%
to
40%
of
them
are
black.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
that
i'm
not
certain
your
honor.
i
would
say
the
black
unemployment
is
19%
in
cairo,
whereas
the
white
unemployment
is
6%.
there
are
poor
whites
in
cairo,
but
not
to
the
same
extent
as
blacks.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
i
believe
your
honor,
that
would
be
something
that
should
be
best
reserved
for
the
district
court
after
letting
us
have
our
day
in
court
which
we
have
not
yet
had
and
then
the
district
court
would
be
in
a
position
to
fashion
the
relief
which
would
determine
who
could
bring
an
action
for
a
show
cause
order.
i
don’t
think
that
we
can
determine
that
here
in
the
abstract.
i
would
suggest
that
the
relief
your
honors
that
we
were
seeking
is
of
a
prohibitory
nature.
we
are
seeking
to
terminate
this
pattern
and
practice
of
racial
discrimination.
the
discriminatory
practices
are
deeply
ingrained
in
cairo
and
what
the
seventh
circuit
suggested
and
it
was
only
by
way
of
suggestion,
was
that
a
reporting
system
be
devised
whereby
the
district
--
whereby
the
state
courts
would
report
the
disposition
of
cases
before
them.
that
would
provide
the
information
to
the
district
court
that
would
be
necessary
to
assure
that
the
order
is
being
enforced.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
there
are
several
problems,
your
honor.
one,
the
appellate
process
on
a
case-by-case
basis
would
not
eliminate
the
on
going
discrimination,
that
on
going
discrimination
goes
in
two
ways.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
it’s
not
clear
your
honor
whether
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
could
mandamus
these
judges
in
the
span
of
time.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
your
honor,
but
it
has
involved
the
different
kind
of
issue.
it’s
generally
involved
the
personal
misbehavior
of
a
judge
in
cases
such
as
bribery
or
criminal
conduct
of
that
kind.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
i
do
your
honor,
but
i
don’t
believe
that
it’s
clear
under
illinois
law
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
could
intervene.
moreover,
your
honor
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
your
honor,
if
i
--
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
go
outside
the
record
to
explain
the
efforts
that
have
been
made
in
the
state
system.
the
federal
remedy
is
a
supplementary
remedy.
it
is
a
remedy
that
is
specifically
provided
by
statute
of
a
congress.
to
read
that
statute
plainly,
it
gives
us
a
cause
of
action
in
federal
court
to
intervene.
granted
the
concept
of
comity
should
tamper
the
exercise
of
federal
injunctive
powers,
but
in
this
kind
of
case
where
you
have
a
pattern
and
practice
where
the
state
has
engaged
in
something
that
has
no
right
to
do,
where
it's
engaged
in
a
conduct
that
is
not
insulated
from
judicial
review,
the
state
court
--
the
federal
courts
have
an
obligation
to
intervene.
the
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
your
honor,
our
damage
claim
was
against
the
state’s
attorney
mr.
berbling.
that
was
--
he
filed
the
petition
72-1107
which
is
pending
before
the
court.
also,
our
claim
against
mr.
spomer
which
is
the
case
that
we
would
be
arguing
next,
in
that
case,
mr.
spomer
substituted
himself
when
he
became
state's
attorney
on
december
4,
1972,
which
was
after
the
seventh
circuit
decision.
in
summary,
your
honors,
judges
do
not
have
the
right
to
engage
in
racial
discrimination.
if
they
did,
they
would
then
have
the
power
to
annul
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
there
is
no
state
relief
here,
we
contend
that
is
adequate
to
solve
a
pattern
and
practice
situation.
the
federal
courts
have
always
borne
the
basic
responsibility
of
guaranteeing
federal
rights
to
its
citizens
when
the
states
have
deprived
them
of
them.
all
we
are
asking
here
is
that
we
have
our
day
in
court
to
prove
our
charges.
this
case
was
dismissed
on
motion
by
the
defendants.
thank
you.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
that
is
correct
your
honor.
we
did
not
feel
that
was
necessary
because
of
the
court’s
decisions
such
as
in
mcneese
versus
board
of
education
where
the
court
has
indicated
that
the
remedy
in
the
--
under
the
civil
rights
statute
is
a
supplementary
remedy
to
that
there
may
or
may
not
exist
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
i
would
--
first
your
honor,
we
did
not
do
that,
but
if
we
had,
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
have
been
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
but
we
would
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
the
problem
with
that
your
honor
is
twofold.
one,
in
order
to
prove
the
charge
and
sentencing,
a
considerable
amount
of
discovery
is
needed
and
the
discovery
--
a
state
judge
whom
we
are
challenging
for
racial
bias
in
his
decision
is
unlikely
as
a
practical
matter
to
grant
us
the
discovery
needed
to
prove
that
he
did
in
fact
engage
in
racial
bias.
second
of
all,
that
individual
case
would
not
have
solved
the
on-going
problem.
that
would
have
solved
simply
that
single
case,
but
what
we
are
talking
about
is
that
there
are
--
there
is
a
continuous
pattern
and
practice
by
this
judges
over
the
years
to
have
engaged
in
this
kind
of
conduct
and
what
we
are
seeking
is
a
prohibitory
injunction
to
prevent
them
from
doing
that
which
they
have
no
right
to
do.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
in
a
pattern
and
practice
case.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
considering
the
history
of
cairo
that
is
not
reasonable
to
expect
that
they
would
do
that.
i
think
moreover
that
the
handling
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis
wouldn’t
solve
the
overall
problem.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
do
not
bring
this
lawsuit
frivolously.
we
have
made
serious
and
grave
charges
here.
we
are
making
those
charges
consistent
with
our
responsibility
under
rule
11
of
the
federal
rules
for
civil
procedure.
that
rule
requires
that
before
an
attorney
sign
a
pleading,
he
have
--
he
must
have
good
grounds
for
it.
we
have
such
grounds
here.
there
has
been
a
fundamental
breakdown
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
cairo,
illinois.
what
we
are
charging
here
is
that
these
defendants
engaged
in
a
pattern
and
practice
of
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
against
these
plaintiffs
and
blacks
similarly
situated
in
cairo,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
lawsuit
where
the
black
citizens
of
cairo.
we
seek
equitable
relief
only
against
these
judges.
we
do
not
seek
damages.
we
seek
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
several
of
them
have,
your
honor.
we
did
not
specifically
alleged
which
one,
instead
what
we
alleged
was
that
we
are
seeking
to
enjoin
the
depravation
of
plaintiffs
of
their
class
rights,
that
was
in
paragraph
one
in
a
number
of
the
paragraphs
in
our
complaint.
we
have
indicated
that
the
plaintiffs
and
others
have
been
deprived
of
their
rights.
we
do
not
specifically
list
out
the
individuals
but
if
we
have
to
we
could.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
they
were
deprived
in
the
one,
an
unofficial
bond
schedule
is
used
when
the
defendant
is
obliged.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
your
honor
but
we
have
not
specifically
named
them
in
the
complaint.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
because
we
have
named
in
general
in
the
allegation
that
the
plaintiffs
have
individually
been
deprived
of
the
rights
that
we
further
alleged.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
it
includes,
the
named
plaintiffs
in
the
class
are
the
black
persons
in
cairo
who
have
been
--
who
were
similarly
situated
in
a
--
who
have
been
similarly
deprived
of
the
kinds
of
rights
that
we
are
alleging
here.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
it
would
be
a
class
--
it
would
be
basically
the
black
persons
of
cairo.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes.
all
they
actually
--
well,
the
class
is
specified
in
our
complaint
as
those
who
are
similarly
situated.
only
those
who
are
similarly
been
deprived
of
rights
as
the
named
plaintiffs.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
in
paragraphs
1,
we
state
that
this
is
a
civil
action
insofar
as
the
judges
are
concerned
for
equitable
relief.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
page
15
your
honor.
to
enjoin
the
deprivation
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
paragraph
1
of
the
appendix.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
well,
your
honor
in
the
paragraph
1
of
the
complaint
which
is
on
page
15,
we
indicate,
we
allege
that
the
plaintiffs
and
members
of
their
class
have
been
deprived
of
certain
rights.
in
paragraph
3,
we
state
under
paragraph
3
(a),
the
plaintiffs
are
black
citizens
of
the
city
of
cairo
with
two
exceptions
and
we
name
the
two
exceptions.
in
paragraph
(b)
we
say,
they
bring
this
option
as
a
class
in
action
individually
and
on
behalf
of
other
similar
situated.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
your
honor,
the
lawsuit
was
originally
filed
against
six
defendants.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
i
understand.
i
am
getting
to
that
point
in
that
when
we
filed
against
six
defendants
and
we
named
the
number
of
plaintiffs
that
we
named
the
number
of
plaintiffs
that
we
have,
some
of
the
charges
go
to
the
state’s
attorney
so
that
some
of
the
plaintiffs
named
were
only
affected
by
the
state’s
attorney’s
conduct.
other
of
the
plaintiffs
were
only
affected
by
the
conduct
of
the
judges.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
either
a
criminal
charge
or
in
the
case
of
the
states
attorney
that
he
sought
to
have
relief
in
the
criminal
courts
which
been
denied.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
your
honor
and
the
i
would
submit
that
we
are
intending
by
our
allegation
on
page
15
of
paragraph
and
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
we
--
in
paragraph
3
(c),
which
would
encompass
in
the
language
of
that
paragraph
the
named
plaintiffs
as
well.
we
are
saying
who
have
on
account
of
their
race
and
because
of
there
exercise
of
first
amendment
right,
having
the
past
and
continued
to
be
subjected
to
the
unconstitutional
and
selectively
discriminatory
enforcement
in
administration
of
criminal
justice.
later
on
in
our
complaint,
we
specify
the
kind
of
conduct
we
are
referring
to
that
the
judges
engage
in
that
they
on
account
of
race
deprived
the
plaintiffs
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
paragraph
35
your
honor
of
the
complaint
at
page
29
i
believe
of
the
appendix
we
state,
with
respect
to
the
judges
that
they
have
deprived
and
continue
to
deprive
plaintiffs
and
members
of
their
class
of
the
rights
to
due
process
and
then
process
and
then
in
fourteenth
amendment
and
then
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
but
we
are
talking
about
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
in
paragraph
36,
we
are
not
referring
to
denied
bail,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
what
i
meant
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
no,
they
are
discriminated
in
the
setting
of
bail
and
that
these
judges
were
all
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
paragraph
36
your
honor
“a”
we
say,
in
a
preface
to
a
that
the
judges
have
denied
and
continued
to
denied
to
plaintiffs
and
members
of
their
class,
the
constitutional
rights
in
the
following
ways
and
then
“a”
is
our
bail
situation,
where
they
--
the
judges
are
following
a
non-official
bond
schedule
that
has
been
established
to
apply
the
blacks.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
under
“b”
your
honor
refers
to
the
sentences.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
the
problem
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
the
problem
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
no,
your
honor.
the
reason
we
alleged
the
way
we
did
is
that
the
plaintiffs
and
members
of
their
class
have
been
sentenced
in
--
they
believe
and
we
believe
to
a
longer
term
than
whites.
to
prove
that
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
your
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
if
your
--
your
honor,
i
submit
that
we
have
in
general
covered
that
by
stating
the
plaintiffs.
when
we
are
filing
a
lawsuit
against
six
defendants,
we
did
not
break
it
down
as
to
which
plaintiffs
where
affected
by
the
conduct
of
which
defendant
except
with
respect
to
the
state’s
attorney
and
mr.
shepherd.
i
would
submit
that
if
in
the
liberal
ruling
--
reading
of
the
rules
for
pleading
that
we
have
covered
it,
but
if
not,
then
we
should
have
a
right
to
amend
our
complaint
because
we
can
specify
the
individuals
who
have
been
directly
affected
by
name
if
we
have
to.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
they
are.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes.
manker
harris
for
example
is
a
named
plaintiff,
every
single
one
of
them
is
a
named
plaintiff.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
james
martin
is
a
plaintiff,
james
wilson
is
a
plaintiff.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes
but,
your
honor,
we
have
filed
simply
one
complaint
which
covered
all
of
the
defendants.
i
submit
your
honor
that
a
--
we
have
pleaded
the
essential
allegations
for
an
action
under
these
statutes.
we
have
stated
that
these
plaintiffs
have
been
discriminated
against.
we’ve
stated
that
the
defendants
have
acted
under
color
of
state
law,
customer
usage.
we
stated
that
the
plaintiffs
have
been
deprived
of
certain
enumerated
rights
and
as
stated
specifically
the
kinds
of
rights
we’re
talking
about
with
respect
to
the
judges.
the
setting
of
bond
in
which
they
use
unofficial
bond
schedule;
the
setting
of
sentences
in
which
they
sentenced
blacks
the
longer
terms
than
whites;
and
the
imposition
of
a
jury
fee
in
certain
kinds
of
cases
which
are
not
imposed
upon
against
whites.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
i
think
your
honor,
one
way
the
seventh
circuit
handled
that
with
respect
to
some
of
our
allegations
going
to
mr.
berbling,
whose
petition
is
pending
before
this
court
is
that
that
we
could
have
the
right
to
amend
our
complaint
if
necessary,
if
the
district
court
found
that
it
was
necessary
in
that
context.
i
think
it
is
important
that
the
seventh
circuit
is
extremely
cognizant
of
what’s
going
on
in
cairo.
cairo
is
located
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
i
don’t
think
it
is
necessary
your
honor
because
i
think
in
our
complaint
we
have
alleged
in
part
what
is
happening
in
cairo
that
there
is
a
considerable
amount
of
tension
between
whites
and
blacks.
it
is
located
--
because
of
its
location
it
has
had
a
history
of
civil
strife
that
since
the
1960s,
these
plaintiffs
have
been
striving
to
obtain
equal
opportunity
and
employment,
in
housing
and
in
participation
in
governmental
affairs.
this
is
created
strife
in
the
community
and
to
the
local
officials
who
--
if
they
applied
the
law
even
handedly
could
help
the
problem
instead
of
exacerbated
it
and
they
engage
in
this
pattern
and
practice
of
discrimination.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
your
honor
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
right.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
i
believe
i
would
adopt
the
language
that
you
are
suggesting,
your
honor.
we
--
i
believe
we've
stated
a
claim
under
the
statutes
in
that
section
1981
provides
that
all
persons
shall
be
subject
to
light
punishments,
penalties,
and
exceptions
as
white
persons.
that
congress
at
the
time
they
pass
the
statute
must
have
been
considering
judges
who
would
be
ones
who
would
be
subjecting
persons
to
punishments,
penalties,
and
exceptions.
i
don’t
believe
that
the
judicial
immunity
applies
to
judges
when
we
are
talking
about
suits
and
equity.
the
case
of
bradley
versus
fisher
that
is
so
heavily
relied
upon
by
the
petitioners
is
not
applicable
to
this
case.
first,
it
was
not
decided
under
the
civil
rights
statutes.
second,
it
was
an
action
in
damages.
third,
it
was
isolated
case
involving
a
judge
--
a
lawyer
who
had
been
taking
off
the
roles
of
attorneys
and
indeed,
the
court
in
giving
the
broad
language
that
it
did
as
to
the
independence
of
the
judiciary
in
that
decision
could
not
augment
that
it
applied
to
judges
when
we
are
talking
about
suits
in
equity
because
at
the
same
time
that
it
decided
that
case,
it
decided
a
case
of
ex
parte
bradley
which
is
at
7
wallace
364
and
in
that
case
the
united
states
supreme
court
issued
a
writ
of
mandamus
to
the
then
supreme
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
compelling
that
court
to
restore
mr.
bradley
to
the
roles
of
attorneys.
this
court’s
decision
was
recently
last
term
in
mitchum
versus
foster
decided
the
question
as
to
whether
a
federal
court
could
issue
an
injunction
against
a
judge.
one
of
the
defendants
in
that
case
was
a
judge.
the
court
granted
in
remanding
that
case
to
the
lower
court
suggested
that
it
should
consider
the
question
of
comity
in
our
federalism
and
equity,
but
in
terms
of
doctrine
of
judicial
immunity,
it
is
clear
that
an
injunction
can
extend
to
a
judge.
we
are
not
asking
a
court
to
infringe
upon
the
lawful
discretionary
action
of
a
judge.
what
we
are
asking
this
--
a
court
to
do
is
prohibit
a
judge
from
doing
that
which
she
has
no
right
to
do.
we've
simple
asked
that
a
judge
--
that
these
judges
be
enjoined
from
using
race
as
criterion
in
the
exercise
of
their
office.
we've
not
asked
the
court
to
tell
the
judge
what
sentence
he
must
impose.
we've
not
asked
the
court
to
tell
the
judge
which
bond
he
must
impose.
we
have
simply
said
that
he
cannot
use
race
as
a
factor
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
and
willfully
and
in
a
pattern
and
practice
case.
we
--
some
of
the
charges
that
we
have
do
not
involve
the
exercise
of
discretion
at
all.
with
respect
to
the
use
of
a
non-official
bond
schedule,
there's
no
discretion
involved.
what
we
are
talking
here
is
it,
when
a
black
appears
before
the
judge,
he
says,
oh,
if
the
defendants
are
black,
the
bond
for
him
will
be
this
because
he
has
a
set
bond
schedule
for
blacks.
we
are
not
talking
about
the
judge
using
weighing
the
various
factors
to
determine
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
i
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
i
believe
it
would
be
under
the
prin
--
but
i'm
not
sure
of
that
your
honor.
i
had
not
considered
that
through
in
this
case.
we
do
not
have
alternative
remedies
against
the
judge
because
one,
there's
no
right
of
damages
against
the
judge;
two,
there's
a
no
way
of
solving
the
problem
in
the
appellate
courts
of
illinois.
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
the
pattern
and
practice.
we
are
not
seeking
to
enjoin
a
pending
state
proceeding.
we
are
seeking
to
terminate
this
pattern
and
practice
of
these
judges.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
it
would
not
be
reflected
in
the
record.
i
think
the
problem
though
i
forward
on
a
case-by-case
basis
are
several.
one,
that
in
order
to
prove
the
charge
of
sentencing
on
a
pattern
and
practice
based
considerable
discovery
is
necessary.
it
involves
a
considerable
amount
of
resources
to
inspect
court
documents
and
police
documents
and
then
computerize
them
to
come
out
with
your
prima
facie
case.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
it
will
not
be
less
so
on
this
case,
but
if
we
prevail
on
this
case
and
prove
our
facts
that
should
end
the
problem.
if
you
had
it
on
the
case-by-case
basis,
then
the
next
defendant
would
have
to
do
the
same
thing
and
you
would
continue
on
infinitum.
moreover,
it
would
not
prevent
the
on
going
discrimination
that
is
occurring.
part
of
the
discrimination
that
we
allege
is
--
we
allege
has
an
effect
on
the
participation
of
these
plaintiffs
in
peaceful
parades
against
the
racially
discriminatory
practices
of
merchants
in
public
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
no,
your
honor.
we
are
not
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
no.
what
we
are
seeking
is
very
simple
that
the
judge
not
be
permitted
to
use
race
as
a
criterion
in
administering
the
law
with
respect
to
bail,
and
sentencing
and
the
imposition
of
jury
fees.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
your
honor,
that’s
right
but
in
--
we
are
charging
that
this
judges
have
violated
that
oath.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
your
honor,
i
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
i
would
suggest,
one,
that
if
a
judge
does
violate
the
federal
court
order
of
that
nature
intentionally
and
willfully
and
not
inadvertently,
then
he
should
be
subjected
to
the
contempt
powers
of
the
court.
second,
i
would
suggest,
we
could
not
go
into
the
federal
court
on
a
show
cause
order
simply
on
isolated
instance.
since
we
are
pleading
a
pattern
and
practice
case
in
order
for
us
to
show
a
violation
of
the
court’s
order,
we
would
again
have
to
show
a
pattern
and
practice
case.
so,
we
are
not
talking
about
five
instances
where
a
black
may
have
gotten
a
different
sentence
than
a
white.
we
are
going
to
have
show
more
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
federal
court
after
hearing
the
parties,
after
weighing
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
and
evaluating
the
evidence,
would
then
be
able
to
be
in
a
better
position
to
fashion
appropriate
relief
and
he
could
put
certain
limitations
on
our
coming
in
to
find
a
judge
in
contempt.
obviously,
that’s
a
serious
thing,
but
we
are
making
serious
charges
here
and
if
--
the
judge
certainly
would
have
the
power
to
require
us
to
come
in,
to
show
again
a
pattern
and
practice.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
blacks.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
no,
your
honor.
we
would,
one
there
has
been
no
finding
as
to
what
the
class
consist
of
by
the
district
court.
that
finding
would
have
to
be
made
first.
then
presumably,
we
would
have
to
show
here,
assuming
the
district
court
fashion
release
the
strict
limitations,
we’d
have
to
show
a
series
of
persons
who
come
within
the
class
who
have
violate
--
who
have
been
deprived
of
those
rights.
it
would
not
be
an
individual
person
who
could
do
it.
the
individual
--
in
the
individual
case
that
could
be
handled
in
other
means,
but
what
we
are
trying
to
do
is
to
prevent
the
pattern
and
practice
situation
and
the
injunctive
relief
is
--
we
believe
the
most
appropriate
remedy.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
the
named
plaintiffs
and
members
of
the
classes
ultimately
determined
by
the
district
court
could
come
in
again
and
request
that
the
court
issue
a
show
cause
order.
it
would
be
necessary
i
believe
in
the
allegations
for
a
filing
of
contempt
that
he
alleged
that
a
series
of
people
have
been
deprived
again
in
violation
of
the
court’s
order.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
it
is
a
population
of
6,000
people
approximately,
35%
to
40%
of
them
are
black.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
that
i'm
not
certain
your
honor.
i
would
say
the
black
unemployment
is
19%
in
cairo,
whereas
the
white
unemployment
is
6%.
there
are
poor
whites
in
cairo,
but
not
to
the
same
extent
as
blacks.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
i
believe
your
honor,
that
would
be
something
that
should
be
best
reserved
for
the
district
court
after
letting
us
have
our
day
in
court
which
we
have
not
yet
had
and
then
the
district
court
would
be
in
a
position
to
fashion
the
relief
which
would
determine
who
could
bring
an
action
for
a
show
cause
order.
i
don’t
think
that
we
can
determine
that
here
in
the
abstract.
i
would
suggest
that
the
relief
your
honors
that
we
were
seeking
is
of
a
prohibitory
nature.
we
are
seeking
to
terminate
this
pattern
and
practice
of
racial
discrimination.
the
discriminatory
practices
are
deeply
ingrained
in
cairo
and
what
the
seventh
circuit
suggested
and
it
was
only
by
way
of
suggestion,
was
that
a
reporting
system
be
devised
whereby
the
district
--
whereby
the
state
courts
would
report
the
disposition
of
cases
before
them.
that
would
provide
the
information
to
the
district
court
that
would
be
necessary
to
assure
that
the
order
is
being
enforced.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
there
are
several
problems,
your
honor.
one,
the
appellate
process
on
a
case-by-case
basis
would
not
eliminate
the
on
going
discrimination,
that
on
going
discrimination
goes
in
two
ways.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
it’s
not
clear
your
honor
whether
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
could
mandamus
these
judges
in
the
span
of
time.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
your
honor,
but
it
has
involved
the
different
kind
of
issue.
it’s
generally
involved
the
personal
misbehavior
of
a
judge
in
cases
such
as
bribery
or
criminal
conduct
of
that
kind.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
i
do
your
honor,
but
i
don’t
believe
that
it’s
clear
under
illinois
law
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
could
intervene.
moreover,
your
honor
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
your
honor,
if
i
--
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
go
outside
the
record
to
explain
the
efforts
that
have
been
made
in
the
state
system.
the
federal
remedy
is
a
supplementary
remedy.
it
is
a
remedy
that
is
specifically
provided
by
statute
of
a
congress.
to
read
that
statute
plainly,
it
gives
us
a
cause
of
action
in
federal
court
to
intervene.
granted
the
concept
of
comity
should
tamper
the
exercise
of
federal
injunctive
powers,
but
in
this
kind
of
case
where
you
have
a
pattern
and
practice
where
the
state
has
engaged
in
something
that
has
no
right
to
do,
where
it's
engaged
in
a
conduct
that
is
not
insulated
from
judicial
review,
the
state
court
--
the
federal
courts
have
an
obligation
to
intervene.
the
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
your
honor,
our
damage
claim
was
against
the
state’s
attorney
mr.
berbling.
that
was
--
he
filed
the
petition
72-1107
which
is
pending
before
the
court.
also,
our
claim
against
mr.
spomer
which
is
the
case
that
we
would
be
arguing
next,
in
that
case,
mr.
spomer
substituted
himself
when
he
became
state's
attorney
on
december
4,
1972,
which
was
after
the
seventh
circuit
decision.
in
summary,
your
honors,
judges
do
not
have
the
right
to
engage
in
racial
discrimination.
if
they
did,
they
would
then
have
the
power
to
annul
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
there
is
no
state
relief
here,
we
contend
that
is
adequate
to
solve
a
pattern
and
practice
situation.
the
federal
courts
have
always
borne
the
basic
responsibility
of
guaranteeing
federal
rights
to
its
citizens
when
the
states
have
deprived
them
of
them.
all
we
are
asking
here
is
that
we
have
our
day
in
court
to
prove
our
charges.
this
case
was
dismissed
on
motion
by
the
defendants.
thank
you.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
that
is
correct
your
honor.
we
did
not
feel
that
was
necessary
because
of
the
court’s
decisions
such
as
in
mcneese
versus
board
of
education
where
the
court
has
indicated
that
the
remedy
in
the
--
under
the
civil
rights
statute
is
a
supplementary
remedy
to
that
there
may
or
may
not
exist
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
i
would
--
first
your
honor,
we
did
not
do
that,
but
if
we
had,
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
have
been
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
but
we
would
--
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
the
problem
with
that
your
honor
is
twofold.
one,
in
order
to
prove
the
charge
and
sentencing,
a
considerable
amount
of
discovery
is
needed
and
the
discovery
--
a
state
judge
whom
we
are
challenging
for
racial
bias
in
his
decision
is
unlikely
as
a
practical
matter
to
grant
us
the
discovery
needed
to
prove
that
he
did
in
fact
engage
in
racial
bias.
second
of
all,
that
individual
case
would
not
have
solved
the
on-going
problem.
that
would
have
solved
simply
that
single
case,
but
what
we
are
talking
about
is
that
there
are
--
there
is
a
continuous
pattern
and
practice
by
this
judges
over
the
years
to
have
engaged
in
this
kind
of
conduct
and
what
we
are
seeking
is
a
prohibitory
injunction
to
prevent
them
from
doing
that
which
they
have
no
right
to
do.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
yes,
in
a
pattern
and
practice
case.
mr.
alan
m.
wiseman
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
considering
the
history
of
cairo
that
is
not
reasonable
to
expect
that
they
would
do
that.
i
think
moreover
that
the
handling
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis
wouldn’t
solve
the
overall
problem.
