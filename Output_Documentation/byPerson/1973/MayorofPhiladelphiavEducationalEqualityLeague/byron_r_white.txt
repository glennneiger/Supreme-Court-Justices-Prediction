justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
explain
the
mayor
could
announce
openly
that
he
is
not
considering
for
the
nominating
panel
any
negroes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn’t
what
i
asked
you,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
that?
how
about
under
the
fourteenth
amendment?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
the
mayor
be
subject
to
any
kind
of
legal
redress?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
your
case
depend
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
your
case
depend
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
let
us
assume--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let’s
assume--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
take
the
same
position
if
the
mayor
was
appointing
the
school
board
members
directly
and
he
announced
that
he
was
not
considering
negroes
for
the
school
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
judges
and
anybody
that
he
had
a
party
of--
in
appointing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
rather
emphasized
the
fact
that
the
deputy
mayor
remains
the
same
person?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
suggest
in
any
event
we
read
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
as
though
it
did
not
direct
the
district
court
to
issue
an
injunction,
but
gives
the
mayor?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
if
the
mayor
did
absolutely
nothing
after--
on
remand,
an
injunction
should
not
issue
until
the
other
side
noticed
some
further
proceedings.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
mayor--
but
with
respect
to
whether
an
injunction
should
issue
against
him
or
not,
the
burden
is
not
on
the
mayor
to
go
in
and
have
some
injunction
vacated?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you--
i
taken
then,
you
really--
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
you
would
really
be
satisfied
if
whatever
part
of
this
judgment
was
declaratory
is
affirmed?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
respect
to
the
mayor.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
there’s
still
the
case
of
controversy
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
between
mayor
rizzo
and
the
plaintiffs?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
if
this
suit
were
brought
--
had
been
brought
for
the
first
time
now,
after
a
new
mayor
had
been
elected,
and
all
you
attack
was
the
activities
of
mayor
tate
and
introduce
no
more
evidence
and
purport
introduced
no
more
evidence
than
you
introduced
in
this
case,
you
might
have
some
trouble
about
having
a
case
of
controversy?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn’t
what
you--
you
aren’t
suggesting
that
the
school
board
members
be
removed,
are
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
is
this
different--
would
it
be
different
if
the
mayor
of
philadelphia
announced
that
he
just
wasn’t
considering
any
members
of
a
particular
political
party
for
a
position
on
the
school
board?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
talks
about
equal
protection,
but
you
should
--
you
may
discriminate
against
somebody,
the
mayor
may
discriminate
against
somebody
on
the
grounds
of
his
political
beliefs?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
you
explain
the
mayor
could
announce
openly
that
he
is
not
considering
for
the
nominating
panel
any
negroes.
justice
byron
r.

that
