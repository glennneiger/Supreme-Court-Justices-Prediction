justice

mr.
wolf,
supposing
that
after
the
1976
presidential
election,
whoever
is
then
president
elect
is
asked
whether
he
plans
to
appoint
a
catholic
to
the
cabinet
and
his
response
is
“no,
i
don’t.
i
didn’t’
get
any
support
from
catholics
in
this
election
and
i
really
have
no
intention
of
considering
them
for
a
cabinet
post.”
would
you
think
then
that
a
representative
group
of
catholics
could
go
into
some
federal
court
and
under
the
due--
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
get
some
sort
of
an
injunction
at
least
requiring
him
to
consider
catholics?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
give
you--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
hypothesis,
i
give
you
the
fact
that
the
president
elect
himself
states
that
they
are
excluded
a
priori.
