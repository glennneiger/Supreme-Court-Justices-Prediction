justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
number
72-1264,
mayor
of
philadelphia
against
education
equality
league,
we
have
a
case
that
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
in
philadelphia
under
a
complicated
provision
of
the
city
charter,
the
mayor
appoints
a
school
board.
the
charter
provides,
however,
for
a
nominating
panel
which
is
required
to
submit
to
the
mayor,
three
nominees
for
every
they
can
see
on
the
school
board.
the
mayor
must
make
appointment
to
the
board
from
among
those
nominees.
the
nominating
panel
consists
of
13
members,
all
appointed
by
the
mayor.
four
may
be
appointed
from
the
citizen
they
oblige;
each
of
the
remaining
members
must
be
the
highest
ranking
officer
of
designated
categories
of
citywide
organizations.
the
respondents
have
said
the
mayor
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment
by
discriminating
against
negros
in
his
appointment
to
the
1971
nominating
panel.
in
that
year,
the
panel
was
composed
of
11
whites
and
2
negros.
the
school
board
itself,
as
to
which
no
discrimination
is
alleged,
was
then
composed
of
seven
whites
and
two
negros.
and
when
this
case
was
argued
there
were
six
whites
and
three
negros
on
the
school
board.
some
34%
of
the
population
of
philadelphia
and
60%
of
the
students
in
the
public
schools
were
negros.
following
a
hearing,
the
district
court
found
no
discrimination
and
dismissed
the
suit.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
reversed.
we
hold,
based
upon
an
examination
of
the
record,
that
the
findings
and
conclusions
of
the
district
court
were
correct.
we
conclude
that
the
factors,
relied
upon
by
the
court
of
appeals,
were
insufficient
to
support
a
conclusion
of
discrimination,
especially
with
respect
to
the
discretionary
appointment
by
an
elected
official
of
a
small
body,
such
as
a
school
board
or
a
nominating
panel.
the
evidence
in
this
case
is
too
fragmentary
and
speculative
to
support
such
a
serious
triage.
accordingly,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
brennan
and
marshall
fully
concurred
and
in
part
of
which
mr.
justice
douglas
concurred.
