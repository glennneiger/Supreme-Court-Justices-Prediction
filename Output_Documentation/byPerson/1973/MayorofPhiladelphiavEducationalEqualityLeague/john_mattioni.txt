mr.
john
mattioni
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
arises
out
of
an
action
commenced
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania,
wherein
the
respondents
sue
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
philadelphia,
then
james
h.
j.
tate,
and
the
members
of
the
educational
nominating
panel.
the
allegations
made
contended
that
the
appointment
to
that
panel
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
race
and,
therefore,
it
was
requested
that
the
appointments
made
by
the
mayor
be
strict
in
as
invalidly
made
under
the
constitution.
in
order
to
fully
understand
what
the
case
is
all
about,
it
is
necessary
to
understand
something
about
the
educational
home
rule
charter
provisions
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
and
the
method
of
selecting
and
appointing
members
of
the
school
board.
in
1965,
the
electors
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
adopted
a
new
home
rule
charter
establishing
a
home
rule
school
district.
this
was
a
result
of
a
commission
appointed
by
mayor
tate
which
studied
the
problem
and
nature
of
the
school
district
some-years
before
the
city
of
philadelphia
having
obtained
an
almost
complete
home
rule
in
all
other
aspects.
the
legislature
of
the
common
law
of
pennsylvania
had
authorized,
now
something
new,
a
home
rule
for
the
school
district
of
philadelphia
as
well.
a
commission
was
appointed
and,
because
of
various
problems,
came
up
with
what
essentially
was
experimental
in
nature,
and
also
represented
something
of
compromise.
the
method
of
selecting
members
of
the
school
board,
which
is
not
an
issue
in
this
matter
before
the
court,
was
determined
essentially
as
follows.
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
would
appoint
13
members
of
the
educational
nominating
panel.
those
13
members
would
in
turn,
for
each
vacancy
on
the
board,
recommend
initially
three,
and
if
the
mayor
requested,
an
additional
three
persons
from
which
the
mayor
could
make
the
appointments
to
the
board
of
education.
the
13
of
the
39
were
required
to
be
appointed
from
certain
classes
of
organizations
within
the
city
of
philadelphia.
there
were
supposed
to
be
citywide
in
scope
and
representative
of
such
groups
as
the
labor,
commercial
interest
intergroup
relations,
parent-teacher
associations,
public
education
representatives,
general
community
organizations
of
citizens,
organizations
for
the
purpose
of
improvement
of
local
government,
higher
education
in
the
form
of
someone
who
is
head
of
a
higher
education
institution
in
the
city
of
philadelphia,
and
a
group
concerned
with
the
physical
resources
of
the
city.
mr.
john
mattioni
by
category,
your
honor.
they
were
not
--
the
charter
did
not
specifically
say
group
x
must
be
the
one
from
which
appointments
are
made
but,
rather,
said
for
example,
with
respect
to
labor
organizations,
a
council
for
other
organization
of
labor
unions
in
the
city,
and
it
did
not
say
that
it
had
to
be
a
particular
one.
the
framers
of
the
charter,
being
aware
and
being
concerned
with
the
fact
that
if
you
specified
a
particular
organization
now,
that
might
go
out
of
existence
in
the
future
or
it
might
become
invalid
in
the
sense
that
it
although
is
still
in
existence
it
might
shrink
in
size
and
not
be
citywide.
mr.
john
mattioni
that’s
correct,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
attack
here
is
solely
on
the
appointments
made
to
the
educational
nominating
panel,
not
to
any
appointments
made
to
the
school
board
of
the
school
district
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
and,
furthermore,
there’s
no
attack
made
on
the
charter
scheme
for
appointments
to
the
board
of
education
nor
any
attack
made
on
the
validity
of
the
nine
categories
and
then,
after
those
nine,
there
is
four
that
are
appointments
in
essence
at
large
by
the
mayor
where
he
has
total
discretion
in
terms
of
those
four.
now,
they
say,
i
believe
that
this
is
essentially
an
experimental
type
concept
and
at
least
until
this
attack
seemed
to
work
reasonably
well.
the
harder
guts
of
the
whole
procedure
was
that
you
wanted
to
have
on
this
panel
persons
who
represented,
in
essence,
all
of
the
various
kinds
of
problems
that
a
school
board
and
a
school
district
would
have
to
deal
with
during
the
course
of
its
existence.
as,
for
example,
we
all
know
in
a--
in
large
urban
school
districts
now
and
indeed
in
many
of
the
smaller
ones,
there
are
truculently
substantial
labor
management
relations
problems
and,
of
course,
in
philadelphia
where
we
do
not
escape
this,
in
the
last
couple
of
years,
we’ve
been
subject
to
rather
extended
and
protracted
labor
disputes
with
school
teachers
and
labor
disputes
with
other
support
personnel
in
the
school
district.
the
school
board
has
to
contend
with
economic
problems
of
a
rather
major
proportion
and,
again,
the
purpose
of
the
charter
was
to
make
sure
that
we
had
represented
on
the
nominating
panel
people
who
could
screen
applicants
and
not
possible
nominees
for
the
school
board
to
insure
that
they
met
at
least
minimally
all
of
the
necessary
requirements,
and
the
concept
was
to
have
people
on
the
nominating
panel
who
had
expertise
in
their
particular
areas.
as,
for
example,
an
organization
dealing
with
intergroup
relations,
because
it’s
quite
clear
that
urban
school
districts
have
substantial
race
relations
problems
and
other
problems
of
a
similar
nature
and
i
think
this
is
borne
out
by
the
fact
that
the
head
of
the
charter
commission
wrote
and
as
quoted
in
respondents’
brief,
“the
panel’s
composition
should
be
so-arranged
in
the
charter
that
it
can
always
constitute
a
balanced
representation
or
a
cross-section
of
the
entire
community,
all
of
the
community’s
ethnic,
racial,
economic,
geographic
elements
and
segments”
and
the
point
here
and
the
reason
why
i’m
dwelling
on
this
is
it’s
important
to
understand
that
this
charter,
at
this
charter
scheme
was
intended
to
be
representative
in
a
very
much
broader
sense
than
simply
on
the
basis
of
black
and
white.respondents
would
have
that
the
only
consideration
is
representation
on
the
basis
of
black
and
white.
i
believe
this
is
further
borne
out
by
the
fact
that
we’re
here
dealing
with
the
fourth
largest
city
in
the
united
states,
a
city
with
a
population
of
approximately
2
million
people,
a
city
which
has
in
its
populous
persons
from
all
kinds
and
all
manner
of
racial
and
ethnic
backgrounds.
for
example,
there
are
large
concentrations
of
italian-americans,
russian-americans,
german-americans.
there
are
large
concentrations
of
blacks
and
of
course
blacks,
like
all
other
people,
can’t
be
put
into
a
bowl
and
mixed
up.
these
are
diverse
people.
they
are,
if
nothing
else,
they
can
be
divided
into
two
broad
general
categories:
blacks
who
were
in
philadelphia
for
hundreds
of
years,
who
predated
even
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
and
those
who
are
of
very
recent
migration
from
areas
in
the
south.
but
in
addition
to
that,
in
addition
to
the
variations
in
population,
philadelphia
is
a
large
industrial
city.
it
has
heavy
industry,
oil
refineries,
smelting
industries.
it’s
a
large
commercial
center.
it
has
banks
and
brokerage
houses
and
stock
exchanges.
it
has
large
commercial
areas
and
retail
sales
and
the
like.
it’s
a
major
port
facility
in
the
united
states.
it’s
probably
the
third
or
fourth
largest
port
in
the
united
states
in
terms
of
tonnage
and
philadelphia,
perhaps
more
important
than
all
of
these
things,
is
known
as
a
residential
city
and,
of
course,
it’s
a
city
with
problems,
very
substantial
problems,
but
those
problems
are
being
dealt
with
here
notwithstanding
all
of
that.
the
respondents
came
into
court
alleging
that
mayor
tate
was
guilty
of
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
making
his
appointments
to
this
educational
nominating
panel.
this
was
proven
by
the
plain
--
by
the
respondents
almost
entirely
on
a
strictly
statistical
basis
but,
at
no
time
in
the
court
below
did
the
respondents
ever
proved
and
that
the
statistics
upon
which
they
relied
had
any
statistical
significance.
not
only
did
they
not
prove
statistical
significance,
but
they
never
proved
the
practical
and
actual
significance
in
an
ordinary
everyday
sense.
what
they
did
prove
was
that
in
1971
mayor
tate
appointed
two
blacks
out
of
13
members
to
the
nominating
panel.
that
from
1965,
through
the
appointments
made
by
the--
in
1971,
blacks
were
appointed
to
the
nominating
panel
on
the
basis
of
an
average
of
two
out
of
thirteen
or,
in
percentages,
approximately
15.4%.
they
also
attempted
to
prove
discrimination
in
appointments
to
the
nominating
panel
on
the
basis
of
alleged
discrimination
by
mayor
tate
in
his
appointments
to
city
government,
and
that
was
purported
to
be
done
by
establishing
from
the
records
produced
by
the
city
of
philadelphia
that
of
all
of
the
persons
appointed,
not
necessarily
by
the
mayor
but
employed
by
the
city
of
philadelphia
earning
$20,000
or
more,
that
only
approximately
9
or
12%,
and
i’m
not
--
the
particular
percentage
--
at
the
moment,
were
black
as
opposed
to
a
population
of
33%
black.
and
that
in
the
boards
and
commissions
the
mayor
appointed
12%
blacks
as
opposed
to
the
same
population
of
33%.
the
respondents
went
further
than
that
and
said
that,
because
the
population
of
the
school
district
in
terms
of
its
pupils
was
approximately
65%
black,
that
this
necessitated
some
additional
consideration
of
race,
i
believe
in
this
instance
a
new
category
never
before
sanctioned
by
any
court,
reference
to
the
school
population
as
opposed
to
the
city
population
of
persons
who
should
be
considered
as
eligible
for
nomination
or
appointment
to
the
nominating
panel.
countering
this,
the
petitioners
submitted
evidence,
first
of
all,
took
the
position
that
there
was
no
statistical
significance
proved
and,
second
of
all,
submitted
evidence
that
the
mayor’s
appointments
to
various
positions
in
city
government,
insofar
as
the
relationship
between
black
and
white
was
concerned,
was
substantially
better
than
private
industry
in
the
same
city,
substantially
better
than
national
averages
in
the
united
states,
substantially
better
than
other
governmental
agencies.
more
importantly,
petitioners
put
in
evidence,
which
was
not
contradicted
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form,
that
the
city
of
philadelphia’s
workforce
is
41%
black
as
opposed
to
33%
in
the
population,
that
24%
of
the
middle
management
was
black,
that
somewhere
between
9
and
12%
of
upper
management
was
black.
now
from
this,
of
course,
the
respondents
would
derive
some
kind
of
discriminatory
pattern.
however,
it
was
further
established
that
under
then
mayor
tate’s
regime,
as
chief
executive
officer
of
the
city
of
philadelphia,
the
pattern
of
employment
of
blacks
in
all
levels,
in
the
lowest
levels,
in
middle
management,
in
upper
management
had
increased
substantially
over
the
8
or
9
or
10
years
that
he
had
been
in
office.
that
he
had
continually
taken
pains
to
ensure
that
qualified
blacks
were
continuously
appointed
and
promoted
and
reappointed
and
re-promoted
as
fast
as
could
be
done
under
the
circumstances,
and
without
infringing
upon
the
rights
of
any
other
person
or
persons
in
the
community.
the
only
complaint
in
essence
that
respondents
have
is
that,
in
their
view,
it
wasn’t
done
fast
enough
and,
because
there
was
some
alleged
statistical
underrepresentation
of
blacks,
that
all
of
a
sudden
this
had
to
prove
racial
discrimination
on
the
part
of
mayor
tate
but,
quite
the
contrary
is
true
when
considered
in
complete
context.
respondents
went
one
step
further.
they
said
that
they
proved
actual
discrimination
on
the
part
of
mayor
tate
in
his
appointment,
and
this
goes
back
then
to
question
of
what
that
evidence
was,
and
bearing
in
mind
that
the
district
court
judge
who
heard
the
evidence
refused
to
find
actual
discrimination.
the
court
of
appeals,
on
the
other
hand,
found
that
there
was
evidence
of
actual
discrimination
which
was
not
rebutted
on
the
record.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
violated
rule
52
(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
because
the
finding
or
the
refusal
to
find
discrimination
by
the
district
court
judge
was
not
clearly
erroneous
and
was,
in
fact,
supported
by
substantial
evidence
in
the
record.
the
only
evidence
of
alleged
actual
discrimination
was
a
testimony
of
w.
wilson
good
who
said
that
in
1696,
two
years
before
the
actions
of
which
complaints
now
made,
mayor
tate
had
publicly
said
at
the
time
the
mayor
made
a
public
statement
that
he
was
not
going
to
appoint
anymore
negroes
to
the
board
because,
in
his
feeling,
they
had
adequate
representation
and
that
he
was
going
to
appoint
someone
from
the
nominees
to
the
board
of
education.
well,
i
submit
that
that’s
a
rather
thin
ice
upon
which
the
bottom,
a
finding
of
actual
discriminatory
intent
on
the
part
of
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
city
of
philadelphia.
not
only
is
that
rather
thin
evidence,
but
it
was
clearly
refuted
in
evidence
by
the
person
who
had
been
instrumental
in
making
the
appointments
acting
as
an
aid
to
mayor
tate.
he
specifically
said
that
mayor
tate
was
an
old
warhorse
politician,
and
that
he
took
into
account
all
of
the
necessary
things
and
his
--
one
of
his
primary
criterion
in
making
appointments
was
to
be
sure
that
everybody
had
adequate
representation
on
these
kinds
of
boards
or
commissions,
including
the
nominating
panel.
and,
of
course,
in
the
final
analysis,
the
question
really
comes
down
to,
looking
at
the
educational
nominating
panel
itself,
considering
what
it's
purpose
was,
considering
what
it
was
intended
to
do,
intended
to
achieve
and
how
it
was
intended
to
achieve
it,
a
finding
of
discrimination
whether
inferentially
based
on
statistics
of
which
the
significance
was
never
proved
or
based
upon
the
meager
testimony
of
w.
wilson
good,
which
was
contradicted
and
which
was
not
accepted
by
the
trial
judge
who
heard
the
testimony,
is
grossly
unfair
to
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
philadelphia.
indeed,
it
does
more
harm
to
the
city
of
philadelphia
than
good
in
every
way,
shape,
and
form
that
could
be
imagined
or
considered.
the
respondents
placed
particular
emphasis
on
several
decisions
of
this
court
i
believe
that
they
rely
most
strenuously
upon
calvin
turner
versus
fouche,
a
decision
by
this
honorable
court
in
january
of
1970.
the
difficulty,
i
believe,
with
that--
placing
reliance
upon
that
case
which
must,
of
course,
be
read
in
tandem
with
carter
versus
jury
commissioner
of
greene
county,
is
that,
there,
the
issue
involved:
appointments
to
a
jury
panel
--
grand
jury
panel
which
in
turn
then
appointed
a
school
board,
and
the
evidence
showed
rather
clearly
and
dramatically
that
discrimination
was
involved
in
the
selection
of
grand
jurors
by
the
jury
commission.
now,
the
jury
commissioners
in
that
case
stand
essentially
on
a
footing,
on
the
same
footing
with
the
educational
nominating
panel
in
this
case
and,
interestingly
enough,
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
wanted
to
set
aside
the
appointment
of
the
jury
commissioner,
and
this
court
refused
to
set
aside
that
appointment
notwithstanding
that
all
of
the
jury
commissioners
were
white
and
notwithstanding
it
was
proved
that
they
were
guilty
of
discrimination.
in
the
matter
before
the
court
now,
there
is
not
one
iota
of
evidence
to
establish
that
the
educational
nominating
panel,
the
very
panel
which
is
being
attacked
by
the
respondents,
acted
in
any
way
in
a
discriminatory
manner
in
making
its
recommendations
for
appointment
to
the
mayor.
there
isn’t
even
a
contention
made
here
that
the
mayor
discriminated
in
making
his
appointments
to
the
school
board.
that
is
the
board
which
was
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
running
the
school
system,
not
the
educational
nominating
panel.
it
was
simply
an
instrument
to
(a)
the
mayor
in
making
nominations
to
the
school
board.
of
course,
the
reason
why
no
contention
was
made
to
that
effect
is
rather
clear.
at
the
present
time,
33%
of
the
school
board
is
black
and,
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
in
suit,
24%
was
black,
and
the
school
board
has
never
been
without
black
representation
nor
has
the
educational
nominating
panel
been
without
black
representation.
indeed,
if
the
criteria
sought
to
be
established
by
respondents
were
accepted
by
this
court,
we
would
have
an
almost
insurmountable
problem
because
every
recognizable
ethnic
minority,
every
recognizable
minority
of
any
kind
be
it
asiatic,
be
it
italian-american,
be
it
russian-american,
black-american
would
have
the
same
right
to
proportional
representation
on
this
panel,
but
this
is
a
panel
of
13
members
and
that’s
an
impossibility.
respondents’
witnesses
testified,
for
example,
that
the
puerto
rican-americans
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
were
absolutely
entitled
to
representation
on
this
panel.
but,
the
problem
with
that
is
that
on
a
proportional
basis,
they
couldn’t
be
entitled
to
representation
because
they
represent
less
than
3%
of
the
population
of
the
city
of
philadelphia,
and
one
person
on
the
educational
nominating
panel
represents
8%.
so
that,
they
don’t
even
have
enough
to
say
that
we’re
entitled
to
half
of
one
person
on
the
panel.
and,
if
we
were
to
accept
that
proposition,
then
no
person
who
was
puerto
rican
could
ever
appointed
to
the
panel
because
he’s
not
entitled
to
his
proportion
on
that
panel.
no
person
of
chinese-american
extraction
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
could
ever
be
entitled
to
such
representation
because
although
we
have
a
strong
and
viable
chinese-american
community
in
philadelphia,
it’s
small
and
it’s
too
small
to
be
entitled
to
a
proportion
that
share
on
this
panel.
and
so
under
those
circumstances,
it
would
represent
a
gross
inequity
to
all
other
minorities
and,
indeed,
to
those
who
might
be
considered
as
a
majority,
if
there
is
one,
in
any
urban
center
in
the
united
states
today.
mr.
john
mattioni
i
believe
there
is
not,
your
honor.
i
believe,
however,
that
respondents
could
point
to
one
other
piece
of
evidence
and
that
is
the
fact
that
the
school
board
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
is
under
an
order
to
desegregate
the
school
system
of
the
city
of
philadelphia.
however,
that
doesn’t
really
bear
on
the
nominating
panel
because
the
nominating
panel
has
absolutely
no
responsibility
with
respect
to
running
the
school
board.
mr.
john
mattioni
i
believe
there
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
mattioni
well,
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
an
injunction
should
be
entered
against
the
present
mayor
because
anthony
zecca,
the
deputy
mayor
to
change
tate,
is
still
on
the
staff
of
mayor
rizzo,
of
course
his
position
on
that
staff
is
substantially
different.
that’s
the
only
nexus
or
connection.
other
than
that,
there
is
none.
mr.
john
mattioni
absolutely
none,
your
honor.
of
course,
one
thing
i
have
not
touched
upon
which
also
should
be
kept
in
mind
by
this
court
is
the
fact
that
we
are
here
dealing
with
the
appointments
by
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
city
of
philadelphia.
now,
of
course
in
first
blush,
one
might
say
“well,
what’s
that
got
to
do
with
all
of
this?”
i
mean,
after
all,
he’s
not
the
president
of
the
united
states,
but
it
has
this
much
at
least
to
do
with
it.
he
is
a
chief
executive
officer.
he
is
clearly
the
representative
of
the
executive
branch
of
government,
and
he
--
we
are
here
dealing
within
the
context
of
the
appointments
to
be
made,
a
clear
question
of
executive
discretion
in
the
appointment
power
of
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
philadelphia.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
position
that
petitioners
had
argued
that
we
could
only
refrain
from
interference
with
appointments
of
the
mayor
or
chief
executive
in
terms
of
appointments
that
are
close
and
personal.
in
other
words,
i
think
they
were
suggesting
that
only
those
personal
staff
members
of
the
chief
executive
officer
were
considered
for
entitled
to
any
kind
of
protection.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
that
is
not
an
appropriate
method
of
approaching
the
problem
at
all.
in
a
long
line
of
cases
in
this
court,
appointments
of
executive
officers,
the
president
of
the
united
states
had
been
protected
again
and
again
and
again
and
again.
this
court
has
determined
quite
clearly
that
where
the
president
of
the
united
states
exercises
discretionary
power
committed
to
him,
that
courts
either
should
not
interfere
or
certainly
should
be
loathed
to
interfere,
except
on
the
weightiest
of
evidence.
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
is
not
the
president
of
the
united
states,
but
he
is
an
executive
officer
and,
of
course,
we
do
have
other
problems
here.
we
have
problems
of
the
federal
state
relationship
which
we
have
not
briefed
because
i
don’t
think
those
are
really
terribly
important
here,
but
they
have
to
be
kept
in
focus
as
well.
and,
we’re
now
talking
about
a
man
who
was
charged
by
the
people
who
elected
him
with
exercising
his
discretion
in
making
the
very
appointments
that
are
here
under
attack,
and
we
submit,
very
respectfully,
that
it
would
be
totally
inappropriate.
it
was
totally
inappropriate
for
the
district
court
to
even
consider
the
matter.
it
was
inappropriate
for
the
court
of
appeals
not
only
to
consider
the
matter--
mr.
john
mattioni
i
have
not
forgotten
them,
mr.
justice
marshall,
indeed
--
mr.
john
mattioni
yes.
i
submit,
mr.
justice,
that
that’s--
mr.
john
mattioni
well,
except
for
one
thing,
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
cases
you’re
talking
about
did
not
really
and
truly
involved
discretion
at
all.
when
you
are
hiring
a
--
supposedly
on
an
objective
basis,
on
a
basis
where
people
come
in,
they
take
a
test,
and
either
they
pass
or
fail
it.
they
take
a
physical
exam,
and
pass
it
or
fail
it.
mr.
john
mattioni
there’s
no
discretion.
mr.
john
mattioni
well
of
course,
factually,
they
could
not
appear
here.
mr.
john
mattioni
i’m
sorry,
mr.
justice,
but--
mr.
john
mattioni
i
believe
that,
nevertheless,
it’s
necessary--
mr.
john
mattioni
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
even
if
i
meant--
mr.
john
mattioni
i
believe
that,
in
the
case
of
this
type,
you
should
not
be.
in--
mr.
john
mattioni
if
he
did,
he
would
hardly
be
reelected
in
philadelphia,
sir.
mr.
john
mattioni
i
know,
and
i
submit--
mr.
john
mattioni
well,
i
submit--
mr.
john
mattioni
i
submit
that
he
would
not,
mr.
justice,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
this.
mr.
john
mattioni
sir?
mr.
john
mattioni
no,
it
does
not
because
i
don’t
believe
that
anything
like
that
has
been
proved.
on
the
other
hand,
i
believe
that--
mr.
john
mattioni
if
nothing
else,
sir,
what
must
be
kept
in
mind
here
is
this.
that
this
is
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
city
of
philadelphia,
and
i
certainly--
mr.
john
mattioni
some
consideration
of
that
fact
is
necessary
which
requires
a
court
to
at
least
step
back
and
say
“well,
before
i’m
going
to
get
involved
in
this
case,
there’s
got
to
be
some
weighty
evidence
establishing
allegations
of
actual
discrimination.”
mr.
john
mattioni
i
believe,
i
would,
mr.
justice,
for
this
reason.
mr.
john
mattioni
yes,
mr.
justice,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
simple.
this
is
still
a
tri-partite
form
of
government
and
if
we
are
to
have
faith
in
the
electors
of
our
country
and
in
our
cities
and
the
whole
works,
if
we’re
going
to
have
any
faith
in
that
system
at
all,
we’ve
got
to
trust
to
the
good
judgment
of
the
electors
that
if
we
have
somebody
who
acts
in
that
gross
of
fashion,
that
he
will
be
turned
out
of
office.
it’s
all
it
takes.
mr.
john
mattioni
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
mattioni
in
different
context,
the
mayor
is
fully
subject
to
every
order
of
this
court
and
this
court
has
full
authority,
but
i’m
saying,
in
this
kind
of
context,
this
court
should
not.
mr.
john
mattioni
in
this
context
where
we
are
dealing
with
a
question
of
executive
discretion
as
opposed
to
other
types.
if
the
mayor,
for
example,
got
up
and
said
“i’m
not
going
to
obey
the
court
--
mr.
john
mattioni
it
depends
on
the
circumstances,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
mattioni
but
again,
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
depends
on
the
particular
facts
in
a
given
case.
mr.
john
mattioni
no,
not
that,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
mattioni
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
matter
arises
out
of
an
action
commenced
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
eastern
district
of
pennsylvania,
wherein
the
respondents
sue
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
philadelphia,
then
james
h.
j.
tate,
and
the
members
of
the
educational
nominating
panel.
the
allegations
made
contended
that
the
appointment
to
that
panel
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
race
and,
therefore,
it
was
requested
that
the
appointments
made
by
the
mayor
be
strict
in
as
invalidly
made
under
the
constitution.
in
order
to
fully
understand
what
the
case
is
all
about,
it
is
necessary
to
understand
something
about
the
educational
home
rule
charter
provisions
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
and
the
method
of
selecting
and
appointing
members
of
the
school
board.
in
1965,
the
electors
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
adopted
a
new
home
rule
charter
establishing
a
home
rule
school
district.
this
was
a
result
of
a
commission
appointed
by
mayor
tate
which
studied
the
problem
and
nature
of
the
school
district
some-years
before
the
city
of
philadelphia
having
obtained
an
almost
complete
home
rule
in
all
other
aspects.
the
legislature
of
the
common
law
of
pennsylvania
had
authorized,
now
something
new,
a
home
rule
for
the
school
district
of
philadelphia
as
well.
a
commission
was
appointed
and,
because
of
various
problems,
came
up
with
what
essentially
was
experimental
in
nature,
and
also
represented
something
of
compromise.
the
method
of
selecting
members
of
the
school
board,
which
is
not
an
issue
in
this
matter
before
the
court,
was
determined
essentially
as
follows.
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
would
appoint
13
members
of
the
educational
nominating
panel.
those
13
members
would
in
turn,
for
each
vacancy
on
the
board,
recommend
initially
three,
and
if
the
mayor
requested,
an
additional
three
persons
from
which
the
mayor
could
make
the
appointments
to
the
board
of
education.
the
13
of
the
39
were
required
to
be
appointed
from
certain
classes
of
organizations
within
the
city
of
philadelphia.
there
were
supposed
to
be
citywide
in
scope
and
representative
of
such
groups
as
the
labor,
commercial
interest
intergroup
relations,
parent-teacher
associations,
public
education
representatives,
general
community
organizations
of
citizens,
organizations
for
the
purpose
of
improvement
of
local
government,
higher
education
in
the
form
of
someone
who
is
head
of
a
higher
education
institution
in
the
city
of
philadelphia,
and
a
group
concerned
with
the
physical
resources
of
the
city.
mr.
john
mattioni
by
category,
your
honor.
they
were
not
--
the
charter
did
not
specifically
say
group
x
must
be
the
one
from
which
appointments
are
made
but,
rather,
said
for
example,
with
respect
to
labor
organizations,
a
council
for
other
organization
of
labor
unions
in
the
city,
and
it
did
not
say
that
it
had
to
be
a
particular
one.
the
framers
of
the
charter,
being
aware
and
being
concerned
with
the
fact
that
if
you
specified
a
particular
organization
now,
that
might
go
out
of
existence
in
the
future
or
it
might
become
invalid
in
the
sense
that
it
although
is
still
in
existence
it
might
shrink
in
size
and
not
be
citywide.
mr.
john
mattioni
that’s
correct,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
the
attack
here
is
solely
on
the
appointments
made
to
the
educational
nominating
panel,
not
to
any
appointments
made
to
the
school
board
of
the
school
district
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
and,
furthermore,
there’s
no
attack
made
on
the
charter
scheme
for
appointments
to
the
board
of
education
nor
any
attack
made
on
the
validity
of
the
nine
categories
and
then,
after
those
nine,
there
is
four
that
are
appointments
in
essence
at
large
by
the
mayor
where
he
has
total
discretion
in
terms
of
those
four.
now,
they
say,
i
believe
that
this
is
essentially
an
experimental
type
concept
and
at
least
until
this
attack
seemed
to
work
reasonably
well.
the
harder
guts
of
the
whole
procedure
was
that
you
wanted
to
have
on
this
panel
persons
who
represented,
in
essence,
all
of
the
various
kinds
of
problems
that
a
school
board
and
a
school
district
would
have
to
deal
with
during
the
course
of
its
existence.
as,
for
example,
we
all
know
in
a--
in
large
urban
school
districts
now
and
indeed
in
many
of
the
smaller
ones,
there
are
truculently
substantial
labor
management
relations
problems
and,
of
course,
in
philadelphia
where
we
do
not
escape
this,
in
the
last
couple
of
years,
we’ve
been
subject
to
rather
extended
and
protracted
labor
disputes
with
school
teachers
and
labor
disputes
with
other
support
personnel
in
the
school
district.
the
school
board
has
to
contend
with
economic
problems
of
a
rather
major
proportion
and,
again,
the
purpose
of
the
charter
was
to
make
sure
that
we
had
represented
on
the
nominating
panel
people
who
could
screen
applicants
and
not
possible
nominees
for
the
school
board
to
insure
that
they
met
at
least
minimally
all
of
the
necessary
requirements,
and
the
concept
was
to
have
people
on
the
nominating
panel
who
had
expertise
in
their
particular
areas.
as,
for
example,
an
organization
dealing
with
intergroup
relations,
because
it’s
quite
clear
that
urban
school
districts
have
substantial
race
relations
problems
and
other
problems
of
a
similar
nature
and
i
think
this
is
borne
out
by
the
fact
that
the
head
of
the
charter
commission
wrote
and
as
quoted
in
respondents’
brief,
“the
panel’s
composition
should
be
so-arranged
in
the
charter
that
it
can
always
constitute
a
balanced
representation
or
a
cross-section
of
the
entire
community,
all
of
the
community’s
ethnic,
racial,
economic,
geographic
elements
and
segments”
and
the
point
here
and
the
reason
why
i’m
dwelling
on
this
is
it’s
important
to
understand
that
this
charter,
at
this
charter
scheme
was
intended
to
be
representative
in
a
very
much
broader
sense
than
simply
on
the
basis
of
black
and
white.respondents
would
have
that
the
only
consideration
is
representation
on
the
basis
of
black
and
white.
i
believe
this
is
further
borne
out
by
the
fact
that
we’re
here
dealing
with
the
fourth
largest
city
in
the
united
states,
a
city
with
a
population
of
approximately
2
million
people,
a
city
which
has
in
its
populous
persons
from
all
kinds
and
all
manner
of
racial
and
ethnic
backgrounds.
for
example,
there
are
large
concentrations
of
italian-americans,
russian-americans,
german-americans.
there
are
large
concentrations
of
blacks
and
of
course
blacks,
like
all
other
people,
can’t
be
put
into
a
bowl
and
mixed
up.
these
are
diverse
people.
they
are,
if
nothing
else,
they
can
be
divided
into
two
broad
general
categories:
blacks
who
were
in
philadelphia
for
hundreds
of
years,
who
predated
even
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
and
those
who
are
of
very
recent
migration
from
areas
in
the
south.
but
in
addition
to
that,
in
addition
to
the
variations
in
population,
philadelphia
is
a
large
industrial
city.
it
has
heavy
industry,
oil
refineries,
smelting
industries.
it’s
a
large
commercial
center.
it
has
banks
and
brokerage
houses
and
stock
exchanges.
it
has
large
commercial
areas
and
retail
sales
and
the
like.
it’s
a
major
port
facility
in
the
united
states.
it’s
probably
the
third
or
fourth
largest
port
in
the
united
states
in
terms
of
tonnage
and
philadelphia,
perhaps
more
important
than
all
of
these
things,
is
known
as
a
residential
city
and,
of
course,
it’s
a
city
with
problems,
very
substantial
problems,
but
those
problems
are
being
dealt
with
here
notwithstanding
all
of
that.
the
respondents
came
into
court
alleging
that
mayor
tate
was
guilty
of
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
making
his
appointments
to
this
educational
nominating
panel.
this
was
proven
by
the
plain
--
by
the
respondents
almost
entirely
on
a
strictly
statistical
basis
but,
at
no
time
in
the
court
below
did
the
respondents
ever
proved
and
that
the
statistics
upon
which
they
relied
had
any
statistical
significance.
not
only
did
they
not
prove
statistical
significance,
but
they
never
proved
the
practical
and
actual
significance
in
an
ordinary
everyday
sense.
what
they
did
prove
was
that
in
1971
mayor
tate
appointed
two
blacks
out
of
13
members
to
the
nominating
panel.
that
from
1965,
through
the
appointments
made
by
the--
in
1971,
blacks
were
appointed
to
the
nominating
panel
on
the
basis
of
an
average
of
two
out
of
thirteen
or,
in
percentages,
approximately
15.4%.
they
also
attempted
to
prove
discrimination
in
appointments
to
the
nominating
panel
on
the
basis
of
alleged
discrimination
by
mayor
tate
in
his
appointments
to
city
government,
and
that
was
purported
to
be
done
by
establishing
from
the
records
produced
by
the
city
of
philadelphia
that
of
all
of
the
persons
appointed,
not
necessarily
by
the
mayor
but
employed
by
the
city
of
philadelphia
earning
$20,000
or
more,
that
only
approximately
9
or
12%,
and
i’m
not
--
the
particular
percentage
--
at
the
moment,
were
black
as
opposed
to
a
population
of
33%
black.
and
that
in
the
boards
and
commissions
the
mayor
appointed
12%
blacks
as
opposed
to
the
same
population
of
33%.
the
respondents
went
further
than
that
and
said
that,
because
the
population
of
the
school
district
in
terms
of
its
pupils
was
approximately
65%
black,
that
this
necessitated
some
additional
consideration
of
race,
i
believe
in
this
instance
a
new
category
never
before
sanctioned
by
any
court,
reference
to
the
school
population
as
opposed
to
the
city
population
of
persons
who
should
be
considered
as
eligible
for
nomination
or
appointment
to
the
nominating
panel.
countering
this,
the
petitioners
submitted
evidence,
first
of
all,
took
the
position
that
there
was
no
statistical
significance
proved
and,
second
of
all,
submitted
evidence
that
the
mayor’s
appointments
to
various
positions
in
city
government,
insofar
as
the
relationship
between
black
and
white
was
concerned,
was
substantially
better
than
private
industry
in
the
same
city,
substantially
better
than
national
averages
in
the
united
states,
substantially
better
than
other
governmental
agencies.
more
importantly,
petitioners
put
in
evidence,
which
was
not
contradicted
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form,
that
the
city
of
philadelphia’s
workforce
is
41%
black
as
opposed
to
33%
in
the
population,
that
24%
of
the
middle
management
was
black,
that
somewhere
between
9
and
12%
of
upper
management
was
black.
now
from
this,
of
course,
the
respondents
would
derive
some
kind
of
discriminatory
pattern.
however,
it
was
further
established
that
under
then
mayor
tate’s
regime,
as
chief
executive
officer
of
the
city
of
philadelphia,
the
pattern
of
employment
of
blacks
in
all
levels,
in
the
lowest
levels,
in
middle
management,
in
upper
management
had
increased
substantially
over
the
8
or
9
or
10
years
that
he
had
been
in
office.
that
he
had
continually
taken
pains
to
ensure
that
qualified
blacks
were
continuously
appointed
and
promoted
and
reappointed
and
re-promoted
as
fast
as
could
be
done
under
the
circumstances,
and
without
infringing
upon
the
rights
of
any
other
person
or
persons
in
the
community.
the
only
complaint
in
essence
that
respondents
have
is
that,
in
their
view,
it
wasn’t
done
fast
enough
and,
because
there
was
some
alleged
statistical
underrepresentation
of
blacks,
that
all
of
a
sudden
this
had
to
prove
racial
discrimination
on
the
part
of
mayor
tate
but,
quite
the
contrary
is
true
when
considered
in
complete
context.
respondents
went
one
step
further.
they
said
that
they
proved
actual
discrimination
on
the
part
of
mayor
tate
in
his
appointment,
and
this
goes
back
then
to
question
of
what
that
evidence
was,
and
bearing
in
mind
that
the
district
court
judge
who
heard
the
evidence
refused
to
find
actual
discrimination.
the
court
of
appeals,
on
the
other
hand,
found
that
there
was
evidence
of
actual
discrimination
which
was
not
rebutted
on
the
record.
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
violated
rule
52
(a)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
because
the
finding
or
the
refusal
to
find
discrimination
by
the
district
court
judge
was
not
clearly
erroneous
and
was,
in
fact,
supported
by
substantial
evidence
in
the
record.
the
only
evidence
of
alleged
actual
discrimination
was
a
testimony
of
w.
wilson
good
who
said
that
in
1696,
two
years
before
the
actions
of
which
complaints
now
made,
mayor
tate
had
publicly
said
at
the
time
the
mayor
made
a
public
statement
that
he
was
not
going
to
appoint
anymore
negroes
to
the
board
because,
in
his
feeling,
they
had
adequate
representation
and
that
he
was
going
to
appoint
someone
from
the
nominees
to
the
board
of
education.
well,
i
submit
that
that’s
a
rather
thin
ice
upon
which
the
bottom,
a
finding
of
actual
discriminatory
intent
on
the
part
of
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
city
of
philadelphia.
not
only
is
that
rather
thin
evidence,
but
it
was
clearly
refuted
in
evidence
by
the
person
who
had
been
instrumental
in
making
the
appointments
acting
as
an
aid
to
mayor
tate.
he
specifically
said
that
mayor
tate
was
an
old
warhorse
politician,
and
that
he
took
into
account
all
of
the
necessary
things
and
his
--
one
of
his
primary
criterion
in
making
appointments
was
to
be
sure
that
everybody
had
adequate
representation
on
these
kinds
of
boards
or
commissions,
including
the
nominating
panel.
and,
of
course,
in
the
final
analysis,
the
question
really
comes
down
to,
looking
at
the
educational
nominating
panel
itself,
considering
what
it's
purpose
was,
considering
what
it
was
intended
to
do,
intended
to
achieve
and
how
it
was
intended
to
achieve
it,
a
finding
of
discrimination
whether
inferentially
based
on
statistics
of
which
the
significance
was
never
proved
or
based
upon
the
meager
testimony
of
w.
wilson
good,
which
was
contradicted
and
which
was
not
accepted
by
the
trial
judge
who
heard
the
testimony,
is
grossly
unfair
to
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
philadelphia.
indeed,
it
does
more
harm
to
the
city
of
philadelphia
than
good
in
every
way,
shape,
and
form
that
could
be
imagined
or
considered.
the
respondents
placed
particular
emphasis
on
several
decisions
of
this
court
i
believe
that
they
rely
most
strenuously
upon
calvin
turner
versus
fouche,
a
decision
by
this
honorable
court
in
january
of
1970.
the
difficulty,
i
believe,
with
that--
placing
reliance
upon
that
case
which
must,
of
course,
be
read
in
tandem
with
carter
versus
jury
commissioner
of
greene
county,
is
that,
there,
the
issue
involved:
appointments
to
a
jury
panel
--
grand
jury
panel
which
in
turn
then
appointed
a
school
board,
and
the
evidence
showed
rather
clearly
and
dramatically
that
discrimination
was
involved
in
the
selection
of
grand
jurors
by
the
jury
commission.
now,
the
jury
commissioners
in
that
case
stand
essentially
on
a
footing,
on
the
same
footing
with
the
educational
nominating
panel
in
this
case
and,
interestingly
enough,
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
wanted
to
set
aside
the
appointment
of
the
jury
commissioner,
and
this
court
refused
to
set
aside
that
appointment
notwithstanding
that
all
of
the
jury
commissioners
were
white
and
notwithstanding
it
was
proved
that
they
were
guilty
of
discrimination.
in
the
matter
before
the
court
now,
there
is
not
one
iota
of
evidence
to
establish
that
the
educational
nominating
panel,
the
very
panel
which
is
being
attacked
by
the
respondents,
acted
in
any
way
in
a
discriminatory
manner
in
making
its
recommendations
for
appointment
to
the
mayor.
there
isn’t
even
a
contention
made
here
that
the
mayor
discriminated
in
making
his
appointments
to
the
school
board.
that
is
the
board
which
was
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
running
the
school
system,
not
the
educational
nominating
panel.
it
was
simply
an
instrument
to
(a)
the
mayor
in
making
nominations
to
the
school
board.
of
course,
the
reason
why
no
contention
was
made
to
that
effect
is
rather
clear.
at
the
present
time,
33%
of
the
school
board
is
black
and,
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
in
suit,
24%
was
black,
and
the
school
board
has
never
been
without
black
representation
nor
has
the
educational
nominating
panel
been
without
black
representation.
indeed,
if
the
criteria
sought
to
be
established
by
respondents
were
accepted
by
this
court,
we
would
have
an
almost
insurmountable
problem
because
every
recognizable
ethnic
minority,
every
recognizable
minority
of
any
kind
be
it
asiatic,
be
it
italian-american,
be
it
russian-american,
black-american
would
have
the
same
right
to
proportional
representation
on
this
panel,
but
this
is
a
panel
of
13
members
and
that’s
an
impossibility.
respondents’
witnesses
testified,
for
example,
that
the
puerto
rican-americans
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
were
absolutely
entitled
to
representation
on
this
panel.
but,
the
problem
with
that
is
that
on
a
proportional
basis,
they
couldn’t
be
entitled
to
representation
because
they
represent
less
than
3%
of
the
population
of
the
city
of
philadelphia,
and
one
person
on
the
educational
nominating
panel
represents
8%.
so
that,
they
don’t
even
have
enough
to
say
that
we’re
entitled
to
half
of
one
person
on
the
panel.
and,
if
we
were
to
accept
that
proposition,
then
no
person
who
was
puerto
rican
could
ever
appointed
to
the
panel
because
he’s
not
entitled
to
his
proportion
on
that
panel.
no
person
of
chinese-american
extraction
in
the
city
of
philadelphia
could
ever
be
entitled
to
such
representation
because
although
we
have
a
strong
and
viable
chinese-american
community
in
philadelphia,
it’s
small
and
it’s
too
small
to
be
entitled
to
a
proportion
that
share
on
this
panel.
and
so
under
those
circumstances,
it
would
represent
a
gross
inequity
to
all
other
minorities
and,
indeed,
to
those
who
might
be
considered
as
a
majority,
if
there
is
one,
in
any
urban
center
in
the
united
states
today.
mr.
john
mattioni
i
believe
there
is
not,
your
honor.
i
believe,
however,
that
respondents
could
point
to
one
other
piece
of
evidence
and
that
is
the
fact
that
the
school
board
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
is
under
an
order
to
desegregate
the
school
system
of
the
city
of
philadelphia.
however,
that
doesn’t
really
bear
on
the
nominating
panel
because
the
nominating
panel
has
absolutely
no
responsibility
with
respect
to
running
the
school
board.
mr.
john
mattioni
i
believe
there
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
mattioni
well,
the
court
of
appeals
indicated
that
an
injunction
should
be
entered
against
the
present
mayor
because
anthony
zecca,
the
deputy
mayor
to
change
tate,
is
still
on
the
staff
of
mayor
rizzo,
of
course
his
position
on
that
staff
is
substantially
different.
that’s
the
only
nexus
or
connection.
other
than
that,
there
is
none.
mr.
john
mattioni
absolutely
none,
your
honor.
of
course,
one
thing
i
have
not
touched
upon
which
also
should
be
kept
in
mind
by
this
court
is
the
fact
that
we
are
here
dealing
with
the
appointments
by
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
city
of
philadelphia.
now,
of
course
in
first
blush,
one
might
say
“well,
what’s
that
got
to
do
with
all
of
this?”
i
mean,
after
all,
he’s
not
the
president
of
the
united
states,
but
it
has
this
much
at
least
to
do
with
it.
he
is
a
chief
executive
officer.
he
is
clearly
the
representative
of
the
executive
branch
of
government,
and
he
--
we
are
here
dealing
within
the
context
of
the
appointments
to
be
made,
a
clear
question
of
executive
discretion
in
the
appointment
power
of
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
philadelphia.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
took
the
position
that
petitioners
had
argued
that
we
could
only
refrain
from
interference
with
appointments
of
the
mayor
or
chief
executive
in
terms
of
appointments
that
are
close
and
personal.
in
other
words,
i
think
they
were
suggesting
that
only
those
personal
staff
members
of
the
chief
executive
officer
were
considered
for
entitled
to
any
kind
of
protection.
we
submit
to
this
court
that
that
is
not
an
appropriate
method
of
approaching
the
problem
at
all.
in
a
long
line
of
cases
in
this
court,
appointments
of
executive
officers,
the
president
of
the
united
states
had
been
protected
again
and
again
and
again
and
again.
this
court
has
determined
quite
clearly
that
where
the
president
of
the
united
states
exercises
discretionary
power
committed
to
him,
that
courts
either
should
not
interfere
or
certainly
should
be
loathed
to
interfere,
except
on
the
weightiest
of
evidence.
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
is
not
the
president
of
the
united
states,
but
he
is
an
executive
officer
and,
of
course,
we
do
have
other
problems
here.
we
have
problems
of
the
federal
state
relationship
which
we
have
not
briefed
because
i
don’t
think
those
are
really
terribly
important
here,
but
they
have
to
be
kept
in
focus
as
well.
and,
we’re
now
talking
about
a
man
who
was
charged
by
the
people
who
elected
him
with
exercising
his
discretion
in
making
the
very
appointments
that
are
here
under
attack,
and
we
submit,
very
respectfully,
that
it
would
be
totally
inappropriate.
it
was
totally
inappropriate
for
the
district
court
to
even
consider
the
matter.
it
was
inappropriate
for
the
court
of
appeals
not
only
to
consider
the
matter--
mr.
john
mattioni
i
have
not
forgotten
them,
mr.
justice
marshall,
indeed
--
mr.
john
mattioni
yes.
i
submit,
mr.
justice,
that
that’s--
mr.
john
mattioni
well,
except
for
one
thing,
mr.
justice
marshall.
the
cases
you’re
talking
about
did
not
really
and
truly
involved
discretion
at
all.
when
you
are
hiring
a
--
supposedly
on
an
objective
basis,
on
a
basis
where
people
come
in,
they
take
a
test,
and
either
they
pass
or
fail
it.
they
take
a
physical
exam,
and
pass
it
or
fail
it.
mr.
john
mattioni
there’s
no
discretion.
mr.
john
mattioni
well
of
course,
factually,
they
could
not
appear
here.
mr.
john
mattioni
i’m
sorry,
mr.
justice,
but--
mr.
john
mattioni
i
believe
that,
nevertheless,
it’s
necessary--
mr.
john
mattioni
i
think,
mr.
justice,
that
even
if
i
meant--
mr.
john
mattioni
i
believe
that,
in
the
case
of
this
type,
you
should
not
be.
in--
mr.
john
mattioni
if
he
did,
he
would
hardly
be
reelected
in
philadelphia,
sir.
mr.
john
mattioni
i
know,
and
i
submit--
mr.
john
mattioni
well,
i
submit--
mr.
john
mattioni
i
submit
that
he
would
not,
mr.
justice,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
this.
mr.
john
mattioni
sir?
mr.
john
mattioni
no,
it
does
not
because
i
don’t
believe
that
anything
like
that
has
been
proved.
on
the
other
hand,
i
believe
that--
mr.
john
mattioni
if
nothing
else,
sir,
what
must
be
kept
in
mind
here
is
this.
that
this
is
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
city
of
philadelphia,
and
i
certainly--
mr.
john
mattioni
some
consideration
of
that
fact
is
necessary
which
requires
a
court
to
at
least
step
back
and
say
“well,
before
i’m
going
to
get
involved
in
this
case,
there’s
got
to
be
some
weighty
evidence
establishing
allegations
of
actual
discrimination.”
mr.
john
mattioni
i
believe,
i
would,
mr.
justice,
for
this
reason.
mr.
john
mattioni
yes,
mr.
justice,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
simple.
this
is
still
a
tri-partite
form
of
government
and
if
we
are
to
have
faith
in
the
electors
of
our
country
and
in
our
cities
and
the
whole
works,
if
we’re
going
to
have
any
faith
in
that
system
at
all,
we’ve
got
to
trust
to
the
good
judgment
of
the
electors
that
if
we
have
somebody
who
acts
in
that
gross
of
fashion,
that
he
will
be
turned
out
of
office.
it’s
all
it
takes.
mr.
john
mattioni
yes,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
john
mattioni
in
different
context,
the
mayor
is
fully
subject
to
every
order
of
this
court
and
this
court
has
full
authority,
but
i’m
saying,
in
this
kind
of
context,
this
court
should
not.
mr.
john
mattioni
in
this
context
where
we
are
dealing
with
a
question
of
executive
discretion
as
opposed
to
other
types.
if
the
mayor,
for
example,
got
up
and
said
“i’m
not
going
to
obey
the
court
--
mr.
john
mattioni
it
depends
on
the
circumstances,
mr.
justice.
mr.
john
mattioni
but
again,
mr.
justice,
i
think
it
depends
on
the
particular
facts
in
a
given
case.
mr.
john
mattioni
no,
not
that,
mr.
justice.
