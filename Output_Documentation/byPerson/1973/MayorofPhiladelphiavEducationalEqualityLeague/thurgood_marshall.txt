justice
thurgood
marshall
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
the
cases
where
the
federal
courts
have
ordered
cities
to
employ
a
certain
number
of
policemen
of
a
certain
race?
you’ve
forgotten
those--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
there
was
a
long
line
of
cases
on
one
side.
there’s
a
long
line
on
the
other
side,
too,
isn’t
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
do
admit
that
the
matter
is
calmed
by
the
constitution
so
why
try
to
get
too
much
out
of
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
that
the
city--
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
that
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
is
saying
i’m
not
going
to
hire
a
negro
under
circumstances
and
nothing
can
be
done
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean--
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
try
to
go
too
far?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
don’t
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
you
say
it
wasn’t
proved
in
this
case
without
saying
that
he’s
exempt
from
being
looked
into?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
say
that
the
mayor
cannot
be
questioned
by
a
federal
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
aware
the
fact
that
this
court
has
ruled
against
governors
of
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
say
the
mayor
has
got
more
than
the
governor
has?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
mean
this
type?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
consider
calling
out
the
national
guard
in
the
same
category?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it
showed
in
constantin
this
court
didn’t’
have
any
trouble
questioning
the
government
about
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
this
--
your
difference
is
this
is
filled
up.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
wolf,
what
worries
me
is,
up
until
just
a
few
minutes
ago,
i
understood
you
were
not
after
the
school
board
members
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
now,
you
are.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
when
you
went
back
to
the
lower
court.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn’t
that
matter
before
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
want
us
to
move
blindly
on
this?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
just
to
ignore
what
you
said?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
you
can
attack
the
school
board
members.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
that,
but
i
understood
you
to
say
that
when
you
went
back,
you
more
than
likely
would
ask
that
those
people
that
were
put
on
in
1971
be
removed.
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
i
have
to
ignore
what
you
said
that
they
aren’t
involved,
they
are?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
do
you
want
them
taken
off?
justice
thurgood

even
if
there
were
negroes,
they
have
to
go?
