we
will
hear
arguments
first
in
72-1264,
mayor
of
philadelphia
against
educational
equality
league.
mr.
mattioni.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
were
these
groups
indicated
by
name
or
by
category?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wolf.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
the
selection
of
the
panel
or
the
function
of
the
panel
after
it
was
selected?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
there’s
quite
a
difference
in
the
two?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
many
catholics,
for
example,
on
this
nominating
panel
at
the
time
of
this
litigation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
don’t
you
think
that’s
of
any
importance?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
know
what
proportion
of
catholics
live
in
the
city
of
philadelphia?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
they
have
only
two
members
of
the
panel,
did
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
that,
in
turn,
make
a
difference
in
your
mind?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don’t
know
whether
there
was
any
such
exclusionary
attitude
with
respect
to
other
minorities.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
help
me
a
little?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
does
this
have
to
do--
would
you
relate
that
to
the
panel
problem
that
we’re
dealing
with?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
this
shows
an
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
mayor?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
someone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
this
is
the
correct
standard
of
review
for
a
court
of
appeals
reviewing
findings
of
the
district
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
may
the
court
of
appeals
reverse
if
they
find
that
a
contrary
conclusion
to
that
of
the
district
court
is
a
permissible
conclusion?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
isn’t
the
court
of
appeals’
position,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
to
pursue
that
line
for
a
moment
even
though
it
may
take
us
quite
far,
suppose
the
mayor
having--
a
mayor,
having
been
elected,
has
an
analysis
made
of
the
precincts
and
wards
from
which
his
support
came
and
he
announced
that
since
he
only
had
10%
support
in
the
negro-voting
districts
of
the
city
he
was
going
to
appoint
only
10%
negros,
not
exceeding
10%
of
the
panel,
the
nominating
panel.
now,
that’s
a
political
decision,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
distinguish
it--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
you
distinguish
it
from
the
response
you
gave
to
mr.
justice
stewart?
it’s
a
decision
based
on
political
support.
says
he,
“i
am
going
to
have
people
appointed
to--
within
my
appointing
power,
who
have
supported
me.”
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
does
it
not
suggest
something
about
the
difficulty
of
having
judges
make
these
philosophical
analysis?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wolf,
let
me
ask
you
one
final
question
that
you
may
or
may
not
be
in
position
to
respond
to.
i
noticed
in
footnote
21
that
you
referred
to
on
page
49,
the
court
of
appeals
has
this
statement
about
the
senator.
this
court
finds
that
plaintiffs
are
shown
on
this
record
and
so
forth.
i
notice
in
several
other
places
in
its
opinion
it
uses
the
term
“finds”
or
“found.”
now,
judges
when
they
use
that
term,
ordinarily
mean
they’re
finding
a
fact
which
--
do
you
consider
that
an
appropriate
function
for
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
they
were
just
using
this
term
inadvertently
and
artfully?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
when
judges
use
those
terms,
i
think
they
use
them
more
carefully
normally.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
wolf.
