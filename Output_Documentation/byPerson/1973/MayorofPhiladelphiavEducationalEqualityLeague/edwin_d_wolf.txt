mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it’s
great
honor
for
any
lawyer
to
appear
here.
i’m
pleased
that
i’m
here
younger
than
my
grandfather,
didn’t
appear
here
until
he
was
80
and
my
father
hasn’t
appeared
here
at
all.
i
represent
the
respondents
in
this
case.
in
a
way,
you
see
in
me
a
stand
in
for
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
for
it
is
their
decision
and
their
opinion
that
i
am
here
defending.
my
clients,
therefore,
come
before
this
court
not
as
plaintiffs,
which
they
were
below,
but
as
parties
who
have
--
who
were
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
proved
their
complaint
of
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
make
this
point
at
the
outset
because
our
argument
today
is
that
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
there
is
anything
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
warrants
this
court’s
attention.
the
essence
of
our
argument
is
that
there
is
nothing.
that
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
thoroughly
and
carefully
with
a
unique
fact
situation,
applied
its
earlier
decisions
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
an
unexceptional
manner,
and
neither
developed
nor
applied
a
legal
principle
that
warrants
the
attention
of
this
court.
the
underlying
facts
of
the
case
have
been
stated
by
the
petitioner.
i
would
like
to
add
just
a
couple
of
points.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
purpose
of
the
panel,
the
defendants
below
introduced
a
substantial
amount
of
material
which
purported
to
represent
the
legislative
history
of
the
composition
and
the
establishment
of
the
educational
home
rule
charter.
one
element
that
they
did
not
mention
that
emerges
from
these
documents
is
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
below
before
the
enactment
of
the
charter
about
the
question
of
whether
the
school
board
should
be
elected
or
whether
it
should
be
appointed.
there
was
substantial
support
for
the
election
proposition.
the
compromise
that
resulted
was
this
nominating
panel
and,
particularly,
in
exhibit
d7x
is
a
statement
by
the
chairman
of
the
panel,
a
leading
industrialist
in
the
city,
that
the
panel
was
supposed
to
be
a
counterpart
of
popular
election.
i
think
that
notion
is
important
in
considering
exactly
what
the
concept
of
representation
means.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
the
function
of
the
panel
after
it
was
selected.
the
panel
was
supposed
to
play
the
role
of
an
election
in
a
democratic
system.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
oh,
yes,
because,
as
was
pointed
out
in
response
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question,
we
are
not
attacking
the
action
of
the
panel.
i
mean
only
the
appointment
of--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
i
don’t
know
exactly.
i
think
there
were
probably
two
or
three,
as
best
i
can
tell.
we
didn’t
inquire
as
to
religious
affiliation
at
the
trial,
so
it’s
hard
for
me
to
tell.
i
know
that--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
i
think
that
in
this
case
we
were
trying
to
establish
only
that
there
was
exclusion
from
consideration
of
qualified
blacks
to
the
panel,
and
i
think
that
that’s
an
important
notion
about
our
case.
we
have
never
maintained
that
blacks
are
entitled
to
any
particular
proportion
on
the
panel.
we
are
not
--
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
hold
that.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
order
proportional
representation
as
a
remedy.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
yes,
i
know
that
there
are
more
catholics
than
there
are
blacks.
i
think
it’s
about
40%.
however,
there
are
not
--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
there
are
not
very
many
black
catholics
who
are
in
the
public
schools
because
there’s
a
substantial
archdiocese
in
school
district
in
philadelphia.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
no,
because,
again,
we’re
not
talking
about
whether
everybody
is
represented.
we’re
talking
about
whether
there
was
an
a
priori
exclusion
of
blacks
from
legitimate
consideration
as
members
of
the
panel.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
no,
we
did
not
inquire
into
that,
and
our
clients
would
not
have
had
standing
to
raise
that
as
a
matter--
of
course,
maybe
they
would’ve.
i
don’t
know
whether
they’re
catholic.
i
didn’t
inquire
into
that
because
the
issue
that
we’re
concerned
with
is
the
exclusion
of
blacks
from
consideration.
the
first
element
of
proof
that
we
developed
was
the
composition
of
the
nominating
panels.
in
1965,
there
were
10
whites
and
3
blacks.
in
1967,
there
were
11
whites
and
2
blacks.
in
1969,
there
were
12
whites
and
1
black,
and
in
1971,
initially,
there
were
12
whites
and
1
black
and,
subsequently,
one
of
the
whites
indicated
to
the
mayor
that
he
was
no
longer
the
chief
executive
of
an
organization.
he
was
replaced
by
a
black.
this
three-two-one-two
pattern,
i
would
suggest
and
was
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
not
to
be
conclusive
proof
of
racial
discrimination,
but
was
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
evidence
that
was
consistent
with
an
inference
of
racial
discrimination.
the
second
thing
that
we
proved
that
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
and
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
as
a
fact
was
that
there
were
black
organizations
that
met
these
standards
set
forth
in
the
nine
--
in
eight
of
the
nine
categories
in
the
charter
document.
we
also
proved
and
the
district
court
found
this
a
fact
and
the
circuit
court
accepted
as
a
fact
that
the
person
who
in
fact
put
together
the
list
of
names,
the
deputy
mayor,
mr.
zecca,
did
not
know
of
many
of
these
black
organizations.
these
are
findings
of
fact
16
and
17
in
the
district
court’s
opinion.
we
subsequently
proved
a
pattern
of
underrepresentation
of
blacks
in
other
appointments
by
the
mayor.
we
did
not
prove
discrimination.
we
did
not
go
into
that
issue.
what
we
did
prove,
however,
was
numerical
underrepresentation
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
appendix
from
page
5
to
23
and
you
can
see
in
a
very
graphic
way
the
--
what
i
would
regard
as
a
litany
of
exclusion.
you
have
lists
--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
pages
5
to
23
in
the
appendix,
mr.
justice
stewart.
particularly
with
regard
to
the
boards,
commissions,
and
authorities
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
beginning
on
page
17.
if
you
look
at
the
third
column
and
you
see
the
number
of
black
persons,
on
most
of
these
there
is
either
zero
or
one.
that’s
a
litany
of
tokenism,
i
think,
and
although
we
did
not
set
out
to
prove--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
i’m
sorry.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
i
think
that
the
principal
issue
in
this
case
is
how
do
you
prove
a
case
of
racial
discrimination?
last
term,
in
mcdonnell
douglas
versus
green,
mr.
justice
powell
set
out
at
some
detail
the
order
of
proof
and
the
method
of
proof
in
a
case
of
racial
discrimination,
and
one
of
the
things
that
he
said
was
that
when
you
have
a
respondent
or
a
defendant
or
an
employer
coming
forward
to
say
that
he
had
valid
reasons
not
to
hire
or
to
have
taken
the
personnel
action
into
question.
that
you
could
look
at
other
employment
patterns
by
the
same
person
to
determine
whether
his
defense
was
pre-textual
is
the
word
that
mr.
justice
powell
used
and,
of
course,
this
is
what
the
lower
federal
courts
have
been
dong
ever
since
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
was
enacted.
the
question
of
the
general
employment
pattern,
although
not
determinative,
is
relevant
as
a
matter
of
a
prima
facie
case
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
we
introduced
that
evidence
and,
in
the
district
court’s
opinion,
some
of
that
was
the
subject
of
a
finding
of
fact
in
17
to
19.
there
was
a
reference
to
some
of
this
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
refer
to
it.
although,
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
that
it
was
considering
the
record
as
a
whole.
the
final
evidence
that
we
introduced
was
testimony
by
one
of
the
plaintiffs,
wilson
good,
and
i
think
that
testimony
is
important
not
only
for
the
purpose
that
it
was
cited
by
court
of
appeals,
but
also
to
give
this
court
an
idea
of
what
was
going
on,
what
the
black
community
was
feeling
about
this
educational
nominating
panel
and
what
their
response
was
to
this
particular
pattern
of
appointment.
and,
in
that
context,
what
happened
in
1969
does
become
important
and
does
reflect
on
1971,
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
said,
it
is
consistent
with
an
inference
of
discrimination.
again,
it
does
not
prove
that
in
1971
the
mayor
discriminated
but
this
evidence--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
yes,
because
the--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
in
this
context,
they
can
because
the
issue
is
not
a
factual
inference
to
be
drawn
but
a
legal
inference
to
be
drawn,
and
the
legal
inference
is,
was
there
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case?
if
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case,
then
the
burden
shifts.
this
also
was
made
clear
in
mcdonnell
douglas
versus
green
last
term,
and
that
is
why
the
question
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
the
right
question
and
i
think
that
they
were
correct
in
concluding
that
a
prima
facie
case
of
racial
discrimination
was
made
out
because
a
prima
facie
case
is
not
conclusive
proof.
when
i
was
an
assistant
district
attorney
in
philadelphia
and
trying
criminal
cases,
a
prima
facie
case
was
merely
the
establishment
on
the
one
side
of
the
elements
necessary
to
make
out
an
offense.
it
was
not
the
determination
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
or
beyond
any
kind
of
doubt.
it
was
simply
the
establishment
on
the
record
of
elements
which,
if
unrebutted,
would
be
sufficient
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case.
that
is
a
question
of
law
and
that
is
the
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
addressed,
and
it
is
the
question
on
which
it
reversed
the
district
court.
mr.
good’s
testimony
discussed
the
efforts
of
the
black
community
to
convince
the
mayor
to
appoint
additional
blacks
to
the
nominating
panel
and
to
the
school
board.
he
recounted
that
in
1969
the
efforts
of
the
black
community
had
had
an
effect
on
the
then
existing
nominating
panel,
and
that
the
nominating
panel
had
submitted
two
out
of
three
in
submitting
three
names
for
a
vacancy
that
came
up,
submitted
two
black
names
and
he
also
testified
that
the
mayor
became
angry
at
this
and
made
a
public
statement
that
he
was
not
going
to
appoint
any
additional
blacks
to
the
panel,
to
the
school
board,
and
i
think
it’s
important
that
this
testimony
is
not,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
based
only
on
a
newspaper
article.
the
newspaper
article
was
shown
to
mr.
zecca
in
his
cross-examination
to
see
what
his
response
was,
but
mr.
good
did
not
testify
from
the
newspaper
article.
in
fact,
the
newspaper
article
itself
stated
that
it
was
based
on
statements
that
the
mayor
made
on
television
and,
although
mr.
good
did
not
testify
to
this
and
perhaps
this
was
no
mission
of
mine,
he
did
see
it
on
television.
he
was
not
cross-examined
by
the
city
solicitor
to
determine
whether
his
information
was
hearsay,
and
the
record
only
shows
that
he
testified
that
he
knew
that
the
mayor
knew
made
the
statement.
the
questioning
of
mr.
zecca
in
this
regard
brought
forth
only
that
mr.
zecca
did
not
recall
the
incident.
that
was
on
page
66
and
again
on
page
93
of
the
appendix.
mr.
zecca
was
asked
“do
you
recall?”
and
he
said
“no,
i
don’t
recall.”
well
those,
i
think,
are
the
principal
facts
with
respect
to
the
facts
in
defense
that
the
city
developed.
i
think
it’s
important
to
note
that
mr.
farmer
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
philadelphia
commission
on
human
relations
did
testify
that
there
were
41%
blacks
in
this
philadelphia
city
government.
i
had
always
assumed
at
trial,
beginning
at
trial
and
until
i
received
a
reply
brief
of
the
city
that
the
mayor
did
have
something
to
do
with
the
personnel
practices
of
the
city
but,
according
to
the
reply
brief,
apparently
the
personnel
director
is
independent
of
the
mayor
and,
in
looking
at
the
charter,
i
found
that
that’s
true.
so,
i’m
not
sure
that
the
41%
city
employment
does
prove
anything
about
the
mayor.
on
the
other
hand,
the
testimony
of
mr.
farmer
showed
that
neither
he
nor
anyone
on
his
staff
knew
that
there
was
a
drastic
reduction
in
black
employment
in
the
philadelphia
police
department
which
was
shown
in
another
action
in
federal
district
court
brought
by
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
alleging
employment
discrimination
in
the
police
department.
that’s
on
page
110
of
the
appendix,
and
mr.
farmer,
in
his
capacity
as
the
chief
city
officer
responsible
for
discrimination
and
employment
in
the
city,
simply
didn’t
know
that
this
had
occurred
in
the
philadelphia
police
department.
well,
to
go
back
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
the
court
of
appeals
reviewed
these
facts
and
stated
with
regard
to
them
that
they
were
consistent
with
a
finding
of
racial
discrimination
and
then
apply
the
standard
developed
in
the
jury
cases
of
how
do
you
prove
racial
discrimination,
and
they
said
the
way
you
prove
racial
discrimination
is,
first
of
all,
you
have
to
find
an
underrepresentation
of
blacks.
second
of
all,
you
find
an
opportunity
for
discrimination,
and
then
that
is
enough
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
and,
if
there
is
n
rebuttal
or
at
least
no
rebuttal
of
any
legal
weight,
then
you
conclude
that
the
case
has
been
made
out.
now,
again,
i
think
that
what
we’re
always
concerned
with
is
what
is
the
record
in
the
case?
what
is
the
evidence
that
was
before
the
court?
now,
it
may
be
that
if
mayor
tate
had
testified,
he
could’ve
satisfied
everybody.
he
could’ve
satisfied
everybody.
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
this
court.
he
might
have
even
been
able
to
satisfy
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case
that
he
did
not
discriminate,
but
he
didn’t
testify
and
the
court
of
appeals
made
this
point
in
its
opinion.
it
said
the
mayor
didn’t
testify
and
so
we
don’t
really
know,
but
what
we
do
know
is
--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
what
the
evidence
says
on
the
record.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
absolutely,
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
also
made
that
clear.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
began
its
discussion
of
remedy
by
saying
it
is
for
the
district
court
to
determine
the
precise
nature
of
the
relief.
it
did,
however,
suggest
that
prospective
relief
is
appropriate.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
yes,
that
would
be
my
position
but,
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
as--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
the
courts
of
appeals,
i
think,
was
speaking
to
the
proposition
stated
by
mr.
justice
white,
in
most
recently
in
alexander
versus
louisiana,
quoting
louisiana
versus
united
states
with
regard
to
the
obligation
of
a
federal
court
not
only
to
declare
racial
discrimination
when
it
sees
it
but
also
to
grant
effective
relief
to
see
that
its
effects
are
eliminated
and
that
it
does
not
recur
in
the
future.
that
is
the
question
that
will
be
before
the
district
court
and
i
cannot
tell
you
right
now
whether
i
think
an
injunction
should
issue
against
mayor
rizzo
or
if
it
should--
what
it
term
should
be.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
footnote
21
in
page
49
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
which
is
the
point
that
i
was
just
making,
nevertheless,
on
this
record
mr.
zecca
continues
as
a
deputy
mayor
and,
since
this
court
finds
that
plaintiffs
have
shown
on
this
record
discrimination
in
regard
to
the
present
panel,
the
federal
courts
must
assure
that
the
appointment
of
a
1973
panel
is
free
from
taint
and
i
think
that
in
this
whole
discussion
of
remedy,
which
appears
really
on
one
paragraph
on
pages
48
and
49
of
the
petition,
that
there
is
an
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
they’re
dealing
with
a
record.
for
example,
the
last
sentence
in
footnote
21
says
also
“we
repeat
that
the
defendant
mayor
testified
and
the
court
passes
no
personal
judgment
on
him.”
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
i
think
that’s
true.
i
would,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
would
take
that
position
on
remand.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
i’m
not
sure
that
i--
the
mayor
has
already
appointed
the
1973
panel.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
no,
and
that’s
one
of
the
problems
with
this
case.
there
is
no
order
of
the
district
court
to
review.
there
is
a
suggestion
of
some
of
the
considerations
that
the
district
court
should
keep
in
mind
when
it
comes
to
entering
an
order.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
i
think
that
i
would
not
read
the
--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
i
think
that
the
appropriate
disposition
of
this
case,
as
far
as
i’m
concerned,
is
to
remand
it
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
to
determine
the
precise
nature
of
the
relief
to
which
plaintiffs
are
entitled.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
oh,
yes.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
oh,
yes,
there
is
definitely
a
case
in
controversy.
of
course,
the--
as
cases
go
up
on
appeal,
the
underlying
facts
change
and
the
city
government
went
on.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
we
initially
sought
to
enjoin
any
action
by
the
panel,
but
we
were
denied
that
relief
and
the
panel
did
act.
it
did
submit
names
to
the
mayor.
the
mayor
did
appoint
members
to
the
school
board
for
a
six-year
term
and
they
are
presently
sitting.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
no,
because
there
are
people
sitting
on
the
school
board
as
a
result
of
the
activities
of
a
1971
panel
and,
like
in
turner
versus
fouche
on
remand,
the
remedy
is
to
remove
them.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
that
is
a
possible
remedy
on
remand,
and
the
court
of
appeals,
again,
said
in
its
amendment
to
the
opinion
which
was
filed
in
february
at
our
request
on
remand,
the
district
court--
this
is
on
page
53
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
district
court
should
consider
the
continuing
effectiveness
of
appointments
to
the
board
made
after
august
1971
on
the
basis
of
all
the
facts
which
may
be
developed
at
the
hearing
on
such
remand.
now,
it’s
entirely
possible
that
the
district
court,
in
its
exercise
of
equitable
discretion,
could
conclude
that
it
will
not
remove
these
members
of
the
school
board
for
one
reason
or
another.
on
the
other
hand,
it
clearly
is
open
to
it
to
do
so,
and
by
analogy
to
turner
versus
fouche
where
the
order
entered
by
the
district
court
on
remand
was
in
fact
to
remove
the
school
board
members
who
had
been
appointed
as
a
result
of
the
unconstitutional
process,
that
would
be
a
possible
remedy
here
and
i
think
that,
as
far
as
my
clients
are
concerned,
if
we
are
successful
here
and
if
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
the
entry
of
an
order,
we
will
conduct
some
discovery
and
we
will
take
testimony,
and
then
we
will
have
to
decide,
as
a
matter
of
the
public
interest,
what
remedy
we
desire
to
seek.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
i
think
that
you’re
asking
two
questions
there.
one
is,
whether
they
would
have
a
right
to
attempt
to
prove
that
catholics
were
excluded
at
priori
from
consideration
and,
second--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
--
whether
they
would
succeed.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
i
suspect
that
with
regard
to
a
presidential
appointment
to
the
cabinet
that
the
president
would
introduce
or
at
least
there
would
be
argument
regarding
the
confidential
personal
nature
of
the
relationship
between
the
president
and
a
cabinet
member
regarding
the
political
nature
of
the
appointment,
that
is,
that
the
appointee
is
to
carryout
the
president’s
policy,
and
that
becomes
relevant
as
a
matter
of
rebutting
the
prima
facie
case.
if
you’re
asking
me
whether
a
president
or
any
other
appointing
authority,
having
made
that
statement,
offers
no
defense
or
no
explanation,
whether
that
would
constitute
a
violation
of
either
the
fifth
or
fourteenth
amendment’s
equal
protection
clause,
i
would
say,
yes
and
i
would
say
that
relief
could
be
granted.
but
i
think,
as
i
said,
that
the
issue
in
this
case
and
in
that
case
would
be
not
the
right
and
not
the
power
of
the
federal
court,
but
whether
the
plaintiffs
made
out
their
case
and
that
goes
to
the
simple
legal
question
of
what
constitutes
a
prima
facie
case
of
racial
discrimination
and
what
constitutes
an
adequate
rebuttal
to
a
prima
facie
case
of
racial
discrimination.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
no,
i
don’t
think
that
the
equal
protection
clause
protects
members
of
a
political
party
as
opposed
to
another.
after
all,
the
fourteenth
amendment
says--
talks
about
race.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
i
think
that’s
right,
but
i
don’t
really
think
that
that
was
what
was
intended
to
be
covered
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
that’s
right.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well
i
think
that,
first
of
all,
it’s
really
not
involved
in
this
case.
it’s
a
very
extreme--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
i
think
that
the
equal
protection
clause
would
apply
and
i
think,
again,
in
that
situation
what
you
have
is
an
overwhelming
defense,
overwhelming
explanation.
that
is,
we’re
in
a
political
situation.
we’re
making
political
appointments
and
this
person
is
not
of
the
same
political
party
as
i
am
and,
therefore,
that’s
all
the
reason
in
the
world
not
to
appoint
him.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
i
think
that
you
begin
to
get
into
mr.
justice
powell’s
word
of
pre-textual.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
no,
what
i
mean
is
that
you--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
what
i
mean
is
that
you
begin
to
get
to
the
question
of
whether
saying
that
he
is
not
going
to
appoint
any
members
of
that
political
party
is
a
pre-text
for
not
appointing
any
blacks
and
if
you
find
that
it’s
a
pre-text,
then
i
think
that
it
is
subject
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
that’s
right.
i
think
that
that
would
not
be
valid.
i
think
it
would
not
be
valid
because
it
is
an
a
priori
limitation,
that
is
exclusion--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
from
consideration
of
members
of
a
particular
race.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
i
think
that’s
a
tough
case.
i
think
it’s
a
lot
tougher
than
the
one
we
have
here,
and
i
think
that
i
--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
oh,
it
is
no
question
that
the--
that
determining
whether
a
case
has
been
made
out
is
always
a
difficult
one
and
the
thing
that
you
have
to
look
at
is--
under
the
law,
is
first
of
all,
whether
the
plaintiffs
have
presented
evidence
which,
if
unrebutted,
would
establish
a
case
of
discrimination
and,
second,
whether
the
defendant
has
brought
forth
evidence
in
mitigation.
the
real
problem
with
this
case,
frankly,
i
think
is
that
the
district
court
said
on
a
couple
of
occasions,
“remember,
if
the
plaintiffs
bring
forth
a
prima
facie
case,
you’ve
got
to
rebut
it”
and
it
was
only
after
the
conclusion
of
plaintiffs’
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
following
day,
that
defendants
indicated
that
they
did
want
to
put
on
some
testimony,
and
we
did
it
about
a
week
later.
but,
i
think
that,
here,
there
really
wasn’t
the
kind
of
political
evidence
that
the
two
hypothetical
situations
you’ve
given
me
would
suggest.
i
think
the
mayor
could
have
come
in
and
said
“well,
i’m
only
going
to
put
on
this
panel
people
who
supported
me
in
elections,”
but
he
didn’t
say
that
and
i
think
that
if
he
had,
we
might
have
had
a
more
difficult
case.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
that’s
right.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
no,
i’m
only
after
the
panel
members.
i’m
only
saying
that
the
--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
oh,
that’s
as
a
matter
of
relief,
mr.
justice
marshall,
only
a
question
of
what
relief
--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
i
don’t
think
so
because
the
question
of
relief
is
always
a
matter--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
excuse
me?
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
no,
i
think
the
case
should
be
sent
back
because--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
no,
because
there’s
no
relief
that’s
been
entered
here.
there’s
no
relief.
the
district
court
has
not
exercised
its
discretion.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
that’s
right
and
the
reason
is
because
the
process
by
which
they
were
appointed
violated
the
constitution
and
if
the
process
violates
the
constitution,
then
under
louisiana
versus--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
there--
when
i
said
they
were
not
involved,
what
i
said
was
there
is
no
attack
on
the
racial
composition
of
the
school
board.
there’s
no
attack
on
the
school--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
because
the
procedure,
the
process,
whereby
they
were
appointed
was
constitutionally
invalid.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
even
if
there
were
negroes
because
the
process
was
unconstitutional.
that’s
why
we
have
constantly
tried
to
make
clear
that
we
are
not
in
any
way
attacking
the
actions
of
the
panel.
we
are
only
attacking
the
process
whereby
the
panel
was
appointed,
and
we
maintain
that
that
was
done
in
a
racially
discriminatory
manner.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
i
don’t
think
they
were
finding
a
fact.
i
think
that
they
were
relying
on
the
findings
of
fact
in
the
court
below
with
the
one
exception
of
mr.
good’s
testimony.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
yes,
because
you
also
find
conclusions
of
law,
i
think,
or
make--
i
guess
you
make
conclusions
upon
as
opposed
to
findings
of
fact.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
i
think
though
that
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
set
of
evidence
makes
out
a
case
of
racial
discrimination
is
a
conclusion
of
law,
and
that
kind
of
conclusion
of
law
is
appropriate
for
a
court
of
appeals
to
draw.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it’s
great
honor
for
any
lawyer
to
appear
here.
i’m
pleased
that
i’m
here
younger
than
my
grandfather,
didn’t
appear
here
until
he
was
80
and
my
father
hasn’t
appeared
here
at
all.
i
represent
the
respondents
in
this
case.
in
a
way,
you
see
in
me
a
stand
in
for
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
for
it
is
their
decision
and
their
opinion
that
i
am
here
defending.
my
clients,
therefore,
come
before
this
court
not
as
plaintiffs,
which
they
were
below,
but
as
parties
who
have
--
who
were
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
proved
their
complaint
of
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
make
this
point
at
the
outset
because
our
argument
today
is
that
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
there
is
anything
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
warrants
this
court’s
attention.
the
essence
of
our
argument
is
that
there
is
nothing.
that
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
thoroughly
and
carefully
with
a
unique
fact
situation,
applied
its
earlier
decisions
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
an
unexceptional
manner,
and
neither
developed
nor
applied
a
legal
principle
that
warrants
the
attention
of
this
court.
the
underlying
facts
of
the
case
have
been
stated
by
the
petitioner.
i
would
like
to
add
just
a
couple
of
points.
first
of
all,
with
regard
to
the
purpose
of
the
panel,
the
defendants
below
introduced
a
substantial
amount
of
material
which
purported
to
represent
the
legislative
history
of
the
composition
and
the
establishment
of
the
educational
home
rule
charter.
one
element
that
they
did
not
mention
that
emerges
from
these
documents
is
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
discussion
below
before
the
enactment
of
the
charter
about
the
question
of
whether
the
school
board
should
be
elected
or
whether
it
should
be
appointed.
there
was
substantial
support
for
the
election
proposition.
the
compromise
that
resulted
was
this
nominating
panel
and,
particularly,
in
exhibit
d7x
is
a
statement
by
the
chairman
of
the
panel,
a
leading
industrialist
in
the
city,
that
the
panel
was
supposed
to
be
a
counterpart
of
popular
election.
i
think
that
notion
is
important
in
considering
exactly
what
the
concept
of
representation
means.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
the
function
of
the
panel
after
it
was
selected.
the
panel
was
supposed
to
play
the
role
of
an
election
in
a
democratic
system.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
oh,
yes,
because,
as
was
pointed
out
in
response
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question,
we
are
not
attacking
the
action
of
the
panel.
i
mean
only
the
appointment
of--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
i
don’t
know
exactly.
i
think
there
were
probably
two
or
three,
as
best
i
can
tell.
we
didn’t
inquire
as
to
religious
affiliation
at
the
trial,
so
it’s
hard
for
me
to
tell.
i
know
that--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
i
think
that
in
this
case
we
were
trying
to
establish
only
that
there
was
exclusion
from
consideration
of
qualified
blacks
to
the
panel,
and
i
think
that
that’s
an
important
notion
about
our
case.
we
have
never
maintained
that
blacks
are
entitled
to
any
particular
proportion
on
the
panel.
we
are
not
--
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
hold
that.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
order
proportional
representation
as
a
remedy.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
yes,
i
know
that
there
are
more
catholics
than
there
are
blacks.
i
think
it’s
about
40%.
however,
there
are
not
--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
there
are
not
very
many
black
catholics
who
are
in
the
public
schools
because
there’s
a
substantial
archdiocese
in
school
district
in
philadelphia.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
no,
because,
again,
we’re
not
talking
about
whether
everybody
is
represented.
we’re
talking
about
whether
there
was
an
a
priori
exclusion
of
blacks
from
legitimate
consideration
as
members
of
the
panel.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
no,
we
did
not
inquire
into
that,
and
our
clients
would
not
have
had
standing
to
raise
that
as
a
matter--
of
course,
maybe
they
would’ve.
i
don’t
know
whether
they’re
catholic.
i
didn’t
inquire
into
that
because
the
issue
that
we’re
concerned
with
is
the
exclusion
of
blacks
from
consideration.
the
first
element
of
proof
that
we
developed
was
the
composition
of
the
nominating
panels.
in
1965,
there
were
10
whites
and
3
blacks.
in
1967,
there
were
11
whites
and
2
blacks.
in
1969,
there
were
12
whites
and
1
black,
and
in
1971,
initially,
there
were
12
whites
and
1
black
and,
subsequently,
one
of
the
whites
indicated
to
the
mayor
that
he
was
no
longer
the
chief
executive
of
an
organization.
he
was
replaced
by
a
black.
this
three-two-one-two
pattern,
i
would
suggest
and
was
found
by
the
court
of
appeals
not
to
be
conclusive
proof
of
racial
discrimination,
but
was
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
evidence
that
was
consistent
with
an
inference
of
racial
discrimination.
the
second
thing
that
we
proved
that
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
and
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
as
a
fact
was
that
there
were
black
organizations
that
met
these
standards
set
forth
in
the
nine
--
in
eight
of
the
nine
categories
in
the
charter
document.
we
also
proved
and
the
district
court
found
this
a
fact
and
the
circuit
court
accepted
as
a
fact
that
the
person
who
in
fact
put
together
the
list
of
names,
the
deputy
mayor,
mr.
zecca,
did
not
know
of
many
of
these
black
organizations.
these
are
findings
of
fact
16
and
17
in
the
district
court’s
opinion.
we
subsequently
proved
a
pattern
of
underrepresentation
of
blacks
in
other
appointments
by
the
mayor.
we
did
not
prove
discrimination.
we
did
not
go
into
that
issue.
what
we
did
prove,
however,
was
numerical
underrepresentation
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
appendix
from
page
5
to
23
and
you
can
see
in
a
very
graphic
way
the
--
what
i
would
regard
as
a
litany
of
exclusion.
you
have
lists
--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
pages
5
to
23
in
the
appendix,
mr.
justice
stewart.
particularly
with
regard
to
the
boards,
commissions,
and
authorities
of
the
city
of
philadelphia
beginning
on
page
17.
if
you
look
at
the
third
column
and
you
see
the
number
of
black
persons,
on
most
of
these
there
is
either
zero
or
one.
that’s
a
litany
of
tokenism,
i
think,
and
although
we
did
not
set
out
to
prove--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
i’m
sorry.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
yes,
sir.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
i
think
that
the
principal
issue
in
this
case
is
how
do
you
prove
a
case
of
racial
discrimination?
last
term,
in
mcdonnell
douglas
versus
green,
mr.
justice
powell
set
out
at
some
detail
the
order
of
proof
and
the
method
of
proof
in
a
case
of
racial
discrimination,
and
one
of
the
things
that
he
said
was
that
when
you
have
a
respondent
or
a
defendant
or
an
employer
coming
forward
to
say
that
he
had
valid
reasons
not
to
hire
or
to
have
taken
the
personnel
action
into
question.
that
you
could
look
at
other
employment
patterns
by
the
same
person
to
determine
whether
his
defense
was
pre-textual
is
the
word
that
mr.
justice
powell
used
and,
of
course,
this
is
what
the
lower
federal
courts
have
been
dong
ever
since
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
was
enacted.
the
question
of
the
general
employment
pattern,
although
not
determinative,
is
relevant
as
a
matter
of
a
prima
facie
case
and
it
was
for
that
reason
that
we
introduced
that
evidence
and,
in
the
district
court’s
opinion,
some
of
that
was
the
subject
of
a
finding
of
fact
in
17
to
19.
there
was
a
reference
to
some
of
this
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
refer
to
it.
although,
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
of
appeals
did
say
that
it
was
considering
the
record
as
a
whole.
the
final
evidence
that
we
introduced
was
testimony
by
one
of
the
plaintiffs,
wilson
good,
and
i
think
that
testimony
is
important
not
only
for
the
purpose
that
it
was
cited
by
court
of
appeals,
but
also
to
give
this
court
an
idea
of
what
was
going
on,
what
the
black
community
was
feeling
about
this
educational
nominating
panel
and
what
their
response
was
to
this
particular
pattern
of
appointment.
and,
in
that
context,
what
happened
in
1969
does
become
important
and
does
reflect
on
1971,
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
said,
it
is
consistent
with
an
inference
of
discrimination.
again,
it
does
not
prove
that
in
1971
the
mayor
discriminated
but
this
evidence--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
yes,
because
the--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
in
this
context,
they
can
because
the
issue
is
not
a
factual
inference
to
be
drawn
but
a
legal
inference
to
be
drawn,
and
the
legal
inference
is,
was
there
sufficient
evidence
in
the
record
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case?
if
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case,
then
the
burden
shifts.
this
also
was
made
clear
in
mcdonnell
douglas
versus
green
last
term,
and
that
is
why
the
question
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
the
right
question
and
i
think
that
they
were
correct
in
concluding
that
a
prima
facie
case
of
racial
discrimination
was
made
out
because
a
prima
facie
case
is
not
conclusive
proof.
when
i
was
an
assistant
district
attorney
in
philadelphia
and
trying
criminal
cases,
a
prima
facie
case
was
merely
the
establishment
on
the
one
side
of
the
elements
necessary
to
make
out
an
offense.
it
was
not
the
determination
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
or
beyond
any
kind
of
doubt.
it
was
simply
the
establishment
on
the
record
of
elements
which,
if
unrebutted,
would
be
sufficient
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case.
that
is
a
question
of
law
and
that
is
the
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
addressed,
and
it
is
the
question
on
which
it
reversed
the
district
court.
mr.
good’s
testimony
discussed
the
efforts
of
the
black
community
to
convince
the
mayor
to
appoint
additional
blacks
to
the
nominating
panel
and
to
the
school
board.
he
recounted
that
in
1969
the
efforts
of
the
black
community
had
had
an
effect
on
the
then
existing
nominating
panel,
and
that
the
nominating
panel
had
submitted
two
out
of
three
in
submitting
three
names
for
a
vacancy
that
came
up,
submitted
two
black
names
and
he
also
testified
that
the
mayor
became
angry
at
this
and
made
a
public
statement
that
he
was
not
going
to
appoint
any
additional
blacks
to
the
panel,
to
the
school
board,
and
i
think
it’s
important
that
this
testimony
is
not,
mr.
justice
blackmun,
based
only
on
a
newspaper
article.
the
newspaper
article
was
shown
to
mr.
zecca
in
his
cross-examination
to
see
what
his
response
was,
but
mr.
good
did
not
testify
from
the
newspaper
article.
in
fact,
the
newspaper
article
itself
stated
that
it
was
based
on
statements
that
the
mayor
made
on
television
and,
although
mr.
good
did
not
testify
to
this
and
perhaps
this
was
no
mission
of
mine,
he
did
see
it
on
television.
he
was
not
cross-examined
by
the
city
solicitor
to
determine
whether
his
information
was
hearsay,
and
the
record
only
shows
that
he
testified
that
he
knew
that
the
mayor
knew
made
the
statement.
the
questioning
of
mr.
zecca
in
this
regard
brought
forth
only
that
mr.
zecca
did
not
recall
the
incident.
that
was
on
page
66
and
again
on
page
93
of
the
appendix.
mr.
zecca
was
asked
“do
you
recall?”
and
he
said
“no,
i
don’t
recall.”
well
those,
i
think,
are
the
principal
facts
with
respect
to
the
facts
in
defense
that
the
city
developed.
i
think
it’s
important
to
note
that
mr.
farmer
who
was
the
chairman
of
the
philadelphia
commission
on
human
relations
did
testify
that
there
were
41%
blacks
in
this
philadelphia
city
government.
i
had
always
assumed
at
trial,
beginning
at
trial
and
until
i
received
a
reply
brief
of
the
city
that
the
mayor
did
have
something
to
do
with
the
personnel
practices
of
the
city
but,
according
to
the
reply
brief,
apparently
the
personnel
director
is
independent
of
the
mayor
and,
in
looking
at
the
charter,
i
found
that
that’s
true.
so,
i’m
not
sure
that
the
41%
city
employment
does
prove
anything
about
the
mayor.
on
the
other
hand,
the
testimony
of
mr.
farmer
showed
that
neither
he
nor
anyone
on
his
staff
knew
that
there
was
a
drastic
reduction
in
black
employment
in
the
philadelphia
police
department
which
was
shown
in
another
action
in
federal
district
court
brought
by
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
alleging
employment
discrimination
in
the
police
department.
that’s
on
page
110
of
the
appendix,
and
mr.
farmer,
in
his
capacity
as
the
chief
city
officer
responsible
for
discrimination
and
employment
in
the
city,
simply
didn’t
know
that
this
had
occurred
in
the
philadelphia
police
department.
well,
to
go
back
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
did,
the
court
of
appeals
reviewed
these
facts
and
stated
with
regard
to
them
that
they
were
consistent
with
a
finding
of
racial
discrimination
and
then
apply
the
standard
developed
in
the
jury
cases
of
how
do
you
prove
racial
discrimination,
and
they
said
the
way
you
prove
racial
discrimination
is,
first
of
all,
you
have
to
find
an
underrepresentation
of
blacks.
second
of
all,
you
find
an
opportunity
for
discrimination,
and
then
that
is
enough
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
and,
if
there
is
n
rebuttal
or
at
least
no
rebuttal
of
any
legal
weight,
then
you
conclude
that
the
case
has
been
made
out.
now,
again,
i
think
that
what
we’re
always
concerned
with
is
what
is
the
record
in
the
case?
what
is
the
evidence
that
was
before
the
court?
now,
it
may
be
that
if
mayor
tate
had
testified,
he
could’ve
satisfied
everybody.
he
could’ve
satisfied
everybody.
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
this
court.
he
might
have
even
been
able
to
satisfy
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case
that
he
did
not
discriminate,
but
he
didn’t
testify
and
the
court
of
appeals
made
this
point
in
its
opinion.
it
said
the
mayor
didn’t
testify
and
so
we
don’t
really
know,
but
what
we
do
know
is
--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
what
the
evidence
says
on
the
record.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
absolutely,
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
also
made
that
clear.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
began
its
discussion
of
remedy
by
saying
it
is
for
the
district
court
to
determine
the
precise
nature
of
the
relief.
it
did,
however,
suggest
that
prospective
relief
is
appropriate.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
yes,
that
would
be
my
position
but,
on
the
other
hand,
i
think
as--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
the
courts
of
appeals,
i
think,
was
speaking
to
the
proposition
stated
by
mr.
justice
white,
in
most
recently
in
alexander
versus
louisiana,
quoting
louisiana
versus
united
states
with
regard
to
the
obligation
of
a
federal
court
not
only
to
declare
racial
discrimination
when
it
sees
it
but
also
to
grant
effective
relief
to
see
that
its
effects
are
eliminated
and
that
it
does
not
recur
in
the
future.
that
is
the
question
that
will
be
before
the
district
court
and
i
cannot
tell
you
right
now
whether
i
think
an
injunction
should
issue
against
mayor
rizzo
or
if
it
should--
what
it
term
should
be.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
footnote
21
in
page
49
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
which
is
the
point
that
i
was
just
making,
nevertheless,
on
this
record
mr.
zecca
continues
as
a
deputy
mayor
and,
since
this
court
finds
that
plaintiffs
have
shown
on
this
record
discrimination
in
regard
to
the
present
panel,
the
federal
courts
must
assure
that
the
appointment
of
a
1973
panel
is
free
from
taint
and
i
think
that
in
this
whole
discussion
of
remedy,
which
appears
really
on
one
paragraph
on
pages
48
and
49
of
the
petition,
that
there
is
an
emphasis
on
the
fact
that
they’re
dealing
with
a
record.
for
example,
the
last
sentence
in
footnote
21
says
also
“we
repeat
that
the
defendant
mayor
testified
and
the
court
passes
no
personal
judgment
on
him.”
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
i
think
that’s
true.
i
would,
as
a
practical
matter,
i
would
take
that
position
on
remand.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
i’m
not
sure
that
i--
the
mayor
has
already
appointed
the
1973
panel.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
no,
and
that’s
one
of
the
problems
with
this
case.
there
is
no
order
of
the
district
court
to
review.
there
is
a
suggestion
of
some
of
the
considerations
that
the
district
court
should
keep
in
mind
when
it
comes
to
entering
an
order.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
i
think
that
i
would
not
read
the
--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
i
think
that
the
appropriate
disposition
of
this
case,
as
far
as
i’m
concerned,
is
to
remand
it
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings
to
determine
the
precise
nature
of
the
relief
to
which
plaintiffs
are
entitled.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
oh,
yes.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
oh,
yes,
there
is
definitely
a
case
in
controversy.
of
course,
the--
as
cases
go
up
on
appeal,
the
underlying
facts
change
and
the
city
government
went
on.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
we
initially
sought
to
enjoin
any
action
by
the
panel,
but
we
were
denied
that
relief
and
the
panel
did
act.
it
did
submit
names
to
the
mayor.
the
mayor
did
appoint
members
to
the
school
board
for
a
six-year
term
and
they
are
presently
sitting.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
no,
because
there
are
people
sitting
on
the
school
board
as
a
result
of
the
activities
of
a
1971
panel
and,
like
in
turner
versus
fouche
on
remand,
the
remedy
is
to
remove
them.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
that
is
a
possible
remedy
on
remand,
and
the
court
of
appeals,
again,
said
in
its
amendment
to
the
opinion
which
was
filed
in
february
at
our
request
on
remand,
the
district
court--
this
is
on
page
53
of
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
district
court
should
consider
the
continuing
effectiveness
of
appointments
to
the
board
made
after
august
1971
on
the
basis
of
all
the
facts
which
may
be
developed
at
the
hearing
on
such
remand.
now,
it’s
entirely
possible
that
the
district
court,
in
its
exercise
of
equitable
discretion,
could
conclude
that
it
will
not
remove
these
members
of
the
school
board
for
one
reason
or
another.
on
the
other
hand,
it
clearly
is
open
to
it
to
do
so,
and
by
analogy
to
turner
versus
fouche
where
the
order
entered
by
the
district
court
on
remand
was
in
fact
to
remove
the
school
board
members
who
had
been
appointed
as
a
result
of
the
unconstitutional
process,
that
would
be
a
possible
remedy
here
and
i
think
that,
as
far
as
my
clients
are
concerned,
if
we
are
successful
here
and
if
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
the
entry
of
an
order,
we
will
conduct
some
discovery
and
we
will
take
testimony,
and
then
we
will
have
to
decide,
as
a
matter
of
the
public
interest,
what
remedy
we
desire
to
seek.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
i
think
that
you’re
asking
two
questions
there.
one
is,
whether
they
would
have
a
right
to
attempt
to
prove
that
catholics
were
excluded
at
priori
from
consideration
and,
second--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
--
whether
they
would
succeed.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
i
suspect
that
with
regard
to
a
presidential
appointment
to
the
cabinet
that
the
president
would
introduce
or
at
least
there
would
be
argument
regarding
the
confidential
personal
nature
of
the
relationship
between
the
president
and
a
cabinet
member
regarding
the
political
nature
of
the
appointment,
that
is,
that
the
appointee
is
to
carryout
the
president’s
policy,
and
that
becomes
relevant
as
a
matter
of
rebutting
the
prima
facie
case.
if
you’re
asking
me
whether
a
president
or
any
other
appointing
authority,
having
made
that
statement,
offers
no
defense
or
no
explanation,
whether
that
would
constitute
a
violation
of
either
the
fifth
or
fourteenth
amendment’s
equal
protection
clause,
i
would
say,
yes
and
i
would
say
that
relief
could
be
granted.
but
i
think,
as
i
said,
that
the
issue
in
this
case
and
in
that
case
would
be
not
the
right
and
not
the
power
of
the
federal
court,
but
whether
the
plaintiffs
made
out
their
case
and
that
goes
to
the
simple
legal
question
of
what
constitutes
a
prima
facie
case
of
racial
discrimination
and
what
constitutes
an
adequate
rebuttal
to
a
prima
facie
case
of
racial
discrimination.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
no,
i
don’t
think
that
the
equal
protection
clause
protects
members
of
a
political
party
as
opposed
to
another.
after
all,
the
fourteenth
amendment
says--
talks
about
race.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
i
think
that’s
right,
but
i
don’t
really
think
that
that
was
what
was
intended
to
be
covered
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
that’s
right.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well
i
think
that,
first
of
all,
it’s
really
not
involved
in
this
case.
it’s
a
very
extreme--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
i
think
that
the
equal
protection
clause
would
apply
and
i
think,
again,
in
that
situation
what
you
have
is
an
overwhelming
defense,
overwhelming
explanation.
that
is,
we’re
in
a
political
situation.
we’re
making
political
appointments
and
this
person
is
not
of
the
same
political
party
as
i
am
and,
therefore,
that’s
all
the
reason
in
the
world
not
to
appoint
him.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
i
think
that
you
begin
to
get
into
mr.
justice
powell’s
word
of
pre-textual.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
no,
what
i
mean
is
that
you--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
what
i
mean
is
that
you
begin
to
get
to
the
question
of
whether
saying
that
he
is
not
going
to
appoint
any
members
of
that
political
party
is
a
pre-text
for
not
appointing
any
blacks
and
if
you
find
that
it’s
a
pre-text,
then
i
think
that
it
is
subject
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
that’s
right.
i
think
that
that
would
not
be
valid.
i
think
it
would
not
be
valid
because
it
is
an
a
priori
limitation,
that
is
exclusion--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
from
consideration
of
members
of
a
particular
race.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
i
think
that’s
a
tough
case.
i
think
it’s
a
lot
tougher
than
the
one
we
have
here,
and
i
think
that
i
--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
oh,
it
is
no
question
that
the--
that
determining
whether
a
case
has
been
made
out
is
always
a
difficult
one
and
the
thing
that
you
have
to
look
at
is--
under
the
law,
is
first
of
all,
whether
the
plaintiffs
have
presented
evidence
which,
if
unrebutted,
would
establish
a
case
of
discrimination
and,
second,
whether
the
defendant
has
brought
forth
evidence
in
mitigation.
the
real
problem
with
this
case,
frankly,
i
think
is
that
the
district
court
said
on
a
couple
of
occasions,
“remember,
if
the
plaintiffs
bring
forth
a
prima
facie
case,
you’ve
got
to
rebut
it”
and
it
was
only
after
the
conclusion
of
plaintiffs’
case,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
following
day,
that
defendants
indicated
that
they
did
want
to
put
on
some
testimony,
and
we
did
it
about
a
week
later.
but,
i
think
that,
here,
there
really
wasn’t
the
kind
of
political
evidence
that
the
two
hypothetical
situations
you’ve
given
me
would
suggest.
i
think
the
mayor
could
have
come
in
and
said
“well,
i’m
only
going
to
put
on
this
panel
people
who
supported
me
in
elections,”
but
he
didn’t
say
that
and
i
think
that
if
he
had,
we
might
have
had
a
more
difficult
case.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
that’s
right.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
no,
i’m
only
after
the
panel
members.
i’m
only
saying
that
the
--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
oh,
that’s
as
a
matter
of
relief,
mr.
justice
marshall,
only
a
question
of
what
relief
--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
i
don’t
think
so
because
the
question
of
relief
is
always
a
matter--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
excuse
me?
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
no,
i
think
the
case
should
be
sent
back
because--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
no,
because
there’s
no
relief
that’s
been
entered
here.
there’s
no
relief.
the
district
court
has
not
exercised
its
discretion.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
that’s
right
and
the
reason
is
because
the
process
by
which
they
were
appointed
violated
the
constitution
and
if
the
process
violates
the
constitution,
then
under
louisiana
versus--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
there--
when
i
said
they
were
not
involved,
what
i
said
was
there
is
no
attack
on
the
racial
composition
of
the
school
board.
there’s
no
attack
on
the
school--
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
because
the
procedure,
the
process,
whereby
they
were
appointed
was
constitutionally
invalid.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
even
if
there
were
negroes
because
the
process
was
unconstitutional.
that’s
why
we
have
constantly
tried
to
make
clear
that
we
are
not
in
any
way
attacking
the
actions
of
the
panel.
we
are
only
attacking
the
process
whereby
the
panel
was
appointed,
and
we
maintain
that
that
was
done
in
a
racially
discriminatory
manner.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
i
don’t
think
they
were
finding
a
fact.
i
think
that
they
were
relying
on
the
findings
of
fact
in
the
court
below
with
the
one
exception
of
mr.
good’s
testimony.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
yes,
because
you
also
find
conclusions
of
law,
i
think,
or
make--
i
guess
you
make
conclusions
upon
as
opposed
to
findings
of
fact.
mr.
edwin
d.
wolf
well,
i
think
though
that
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
set
of
evidence
makes
out
a
case
of
racial
discrimination
is
a
conclusion
of
law,
and
that
kind
of
conclusion
of
law
is
appropriate
for
a
court
of
appeals
to
draw.
thank
you
very
much.
