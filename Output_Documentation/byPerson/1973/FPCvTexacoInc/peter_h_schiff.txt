mr.
peter
h.
schiff
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
new
york’s
basic
concern
in
this
case
is
that
the
commission’s
action
which
we
believe
amounts
to
deregulation
of
small
producer
rates
will
result
in
passing
on
excessive
cost
to
consumers
and
inevitably
so
under
just
about
any
construction
of
the
commission’s
order.
but
i
think
it’s
quite
clear
that
even
if
one
accepts
the
possibility
of
indirect
regulation
through
the
use
of
the
pipeline
proceeding,
that
the
commission’s
order
don’t
provide
for
a
determination
of
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
and
notwithstanding
your
question
mr.
justice
white
as
to
looking
at
the
order
the
way
they’re
now
interpreting
it,
i
would
at
least
for
the
time
being,
in
my
limited
time
try
to
say
what
the
commission’s
orders
in
fact
said
and
the
court
of
appeals
construed
it
quite
correctly,
i
don’t
think
any
amount
of
rewriting
can
really
change
it.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
can’t
answer
that.
i
don’t
know
that
--
no
way
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
there's
no
way
of
telling.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
we
can’t
tell
exactly
what
is
being
passed
on
because
these
rates
are
not
being
regulated.
we
can’t
tell
how
much
is
above
the
contract
prices.
the
scheme
that
the
commission
--
the
scheme
of
the
commission
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
we’re
paying
the
pipeline
rates.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
let
me
answer
those
in
terms
because
if
you
would
turn
to
page
142
of
the
joint
appendix
which
is
the
commission’s
order
428
which
is
under
review,
the
commission
set
a
standard.
the
commission
determined
that
in
order
to
encourage
the
small
producers
to
receive
more
money
and
that
the
pipelines
would
contract
the
above
what
had
been
fixed
to
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
the
large
producers
that
it
was
necessary
to
provide
the
pipelines
with
some
assurance
of
certainty.
they
established
the
standard
which
mr.
evans
has
read
to
you
saying
that
the
pipelines
will
be
subject
to
refund,
a
reduction
and
refund
with
respect
to
new
small
producer
sales,
but
only
as
to
that
part
of
the
rate
which
is
unreasonably
high
considering
appropriate
comparisons
with
the
highest
contract
prices
for
sales
by
large
producers
or
the
prevailing
market
price
for
intrastate
sales.
now
the
next
sentence
is
what
i
want
to
concentrate
on
says,
“tracking
increases
to
the
extent
they
reflect
small
producer
prices
for
new
sales
above
the
standards
set
forth
above
may
be
suspended
and
if
so
will
be
collected
subject
to
refund.”
now,
two
sentences
later,
the
commission
says,
“where
there
has
been
a
suspension,”
now,
remember
this
is
only
where
it
is
above
the
standard,
then
the
commission
shall
consider
all
relevant
factors
and
we
don’t
deny
that
the
commission
may
consider
the
relevant
factors
mentioned
in
the
footnote
3
of
the
government’s
reply
brief,
but
that
only
comes
into
play
as
the
court
below,
i
think
recognized,
is
when
the
rates
are
--
that
have
been
paid
or
above
the
standard
fixed.
now
the
standard
fixed
is
an
in
--
is
the
highest
prices
paid
by
--
to
a
large
producer,
contract
price,
i
misspoke
because
it’s
very
important.
traditionally
the
way
the
contracting
has
been
done
under
the
natural
gas
act
at
least
since
phillips
in
1954,
pipelines,
pay
or
contract
at
higher
prices
than
the
commission
actually
allows,
certainly
that’s
been
true
since
there
had
been
real
regulation
by
the
federal
power
commission
and
what
is
dishonorable
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
from
the
files
of
the
federal
power
commission
is
that
there
are
--
the
contract
price
maybe
20,
30,
or
even
40
cents
above
the
rate
that
has
been
determined
just
and
reasonable.
now,
it
is
this
high
price
which
i
suppose
can
be
a
market
standard,
but
it’s
an
artificial
market
standard
at
that
which
the
commission
says,
“anything
up
to
that,
we
will
allow
without
tracking,
without
going
through
it
all.”
and
that
is
what
the
commission’s
order
does
in
this
thing
and
i
don’t
see
how
the
government
can
say
that
they
have
now
rewritten
it.
they
just
don’t
understand
their
own
order
or
at
least
they
don’t
accept
the
impact
of
that.
now
the
court
--
the
courts
have
traditionally
said
that
the
reason
for
regulation
of
sales
by
producers
whether
they
--
it
is
direct
or
indirect
is
because
the
market
is
not
an
adequate
basis
for
determining
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
at
least
where
gas
is
in
short
supply
and
it’s
a
sellers’
market
and
we
most
assuredly
have
the
biggest
sellers’
market
that
there
has
been
since
the
phillips
case.
and
permian
is
--
which
the
government
promised
and
sought
a
conflict
with
--
in
their
petition,
is
not
inconsistent
with
that.
it’s
conceivable
that
there
are
times
when
the
market
may
be
such
that
there
is
buyers’
market
that
competition
will
in
fact
produce
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
or
indeed
as
in
permian,
the
commission
did
look
to
market
prices
to
look
at
how
to
balance
rates
between
different
types
of
sales.
but
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
unregulated
market
price
could
be
a
just
and
reasonable
standard.
now,
there's
another
problem
with
this
order.
the
commission
in
dealing
with
the
pipelines
or
in
both
428
and
428
(b),
the
commission
said,
“we
have
always
been
able
to
examine
the
cost
of
purchase
--
gas
in
a
pipeline
proceeding
and
the
cost
of
other
expenses”
and
the
commission’s
order
expressly,
if
i
may
for
a
second,
at
page
139
said,
“the
commission
has
ample
authority
to
inquire
in
these
cases,
into
the
reasonableness
of
all
operating
expenses
and
to
disallow
items
of
costs
which
are
imprudent.”
now,
this
is
very
important.
of
course
it’s
true.
imprudent
expenses
can
be
disallowed
and
they
sometimes
are
termed
as
excessive
or
not
reasonable
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
purchaser,
but
that
is
not
the
same
as
looking
at
it
from
the
point
view
of
the
seller
as
to
whether
a
seller’s
rate
is
just
and
reasonable
which
is
essentially
related
to
costs,
at
least
it’s
a
surrogate
for
cost
whether
it
has
to
be
based
expressly
on
cost
or
not.
on
the
other
hand,
the
prudency
reasonable
test
is
a
market
test,
the
very
test
which
is
not
permissible
as
a
basis
for
regulation
under
the
natural
gas
act.
now,
this
is
no
different
than
when
a
pipeline
purchases
steel
pipe.
the
pipeline
can’t
determine
what
the
costs
are
of
u.s.
steel.
the
question
of
whether
its
prudent
or
not
is
the
matter
of
whether
the
pipeline
has
exercised
reasonable
contracting
practices
and
has
paid
--
hasn’t
just
gone
out
to
the
layman,
paid
much
more
than
it
had
to
under
market
conditions.
now,
i
know
of
no
authority
and
this
is
where
i
want
to
get
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question,
mr.
boland,
i
know
of
no
authority
under
which
the
fpc
could
disallow
the
cost
based
on
a
--
anything
other
purchased
gas
expenses
in
a
pipeline
proceeding
on
other
--
anything
other
than
the
prudency
test
or
reasonableness
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
buyer
test.
the
only
exception
that
i
know
of
in
regulatory
annals
is
where
there
is
an
affiliation
question
where
the
seller
buys
from
its
affiliate,
then
you
can
get
the
cost
but
otherwise
it’s
a
market
test.
and
so
that
the
commission
has
to
rewrite
its
order
not
only
in
the
first
where
that
we
discussed,
but
also
has
to
rewrite
the
order
on
what
prudency
means
and
it
has
no
legal
authority
to
do
that
and
this
is
where
the
consumer
will
bear
the
brunt
because
the
test
isn’t
the
same
test.
now,
finally
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
the
regulation
that
they
are
promising
is
a
regulation
of
the
purchases
and
the
standard
that
they
are
setting
is
a
market
standard
which
is
not
the
proper
standard
for
what
is
a
just
and
reasonable
price.
and
the
prudency
test
is
not
a
proper
test
and
it’s
the
only
legal
test
for
determining
what
is
a
just
and
reasonable
price.
so,
they
are
saying
they’re
regulating,
but
the
practical
effect
is
that
the
nature
of
the
regulation
is
precisely
the
kind
of
regulation
that
did
exist
before
this
court’s
decision
in
phillips
in
1954.
it
doesn’t
change
one
iota,
notwithstanding
my
friends’
comments
in
their
reply
brief.
that
--
that
was
not
considered
regulation
under
the
natural
gas
act
so
that
--
i
think
that’s
my
answer
to
you
and
that
very
basic
to
it
though
is
that
there
just
is
no
authority,
whether
it
is
--
when
our
commission,
the
new
york
commission
regulates
a
distribution
company
or
the
federal
power
commission
relate
--
regulates
a
pipeline
company,
there's
no
basis
on
which
we
can
disallow
costs
simply
because
they
exceed
what
the
just
and
reasonable
level
would
have
been
for
the
seller.
it’s
a
prudency
test
and
that’s
all
the
authority
that
a
regulatory
commission
has
and
the
fpc
can
change
it
by
saying
it
has
some
other
authority
and
it’s
free.
the
commission’s
order
is
much
more
careful
as
to
its
authority
in
this
respect
i
would
say
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
think
yes,
inevitably
so.
an
issue
which
is
not
really
here,
but
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
certainly
do
not
suggest
you
go
the
whole
way.
i
suggest
that
if
you
did
that
here,
you
do
it
with
respect
to
all
of
producer
regulation
and
i
suggest
that
--
after
18,
19
years
that
this
is
a
decision
to
be
made
in
congress.
there
has
been
various
bills
proposed
in
congress
for
deregulation.
that,
your
honors,
is
a
proper
forum
for
the
attempt
to
deregulate.
now,
i
think
this
is
what
the
commission
is
doing,
but
this
isn’t
the
right
forum.
i
want
to
say
with
respect
to
existing
contracts
that
the
commission
did
not
even
make
a
pretense
at
indirect
regulation,
under
existing
contracts
which
my
have
been
below
the
contract
price,
the
just
and
reasonable
price.
they
let
them
go
off,
let
them
be
passed
through,
no
indirect
regulation.
i
suggest
that
contrary
to
what
it
said
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
government
that
we
properly
raise
that.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
new
york’s
basic
concern
in
this
case
is
that
the
commission’s
action
which
we
believe
amounts
to
deregulation
of
small
producer
rates
will
result
in
passing
on
excessive

to

and
inevitably
so
under
just

any

of
the

but
i
think
it’s
quite

that
even
if

i
don’t

mr.

i

i
don’t

mr.

what

on
because

we

the

that
the
commission
--
the
scheme
of
the
commission
--
mr.

we’re
paying
the

mr.
peter
h.
schiff

answer
those
in

now,

now,

will
in
fact
produce
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
or
indeed
as
in
permian,
the
commission
did
look
to
market
prices
to
look
at
how
to
balance
rates
between
different
types
of
sales.
but
there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
unregulated
market
price
could
be
a
just
and
reasonable
standard.
now,
there's
another
problem
with
this
order.
the
commission
in
dealing
with
the
pipelines
or
in
both
428
and
428
(b),
the
commission
said,
“we
have
always
been
able
to
examine
the
cost
of
purchase
--
gas
in
a
pipeline
proceeding
and
the
cost
of
other
expenses”
and
the
commission’s
order
expressly,
if
i
may
for
a
second,
at
page
139
said,
“the
commission
has
ample
authority
to
inquire
in
these
cases,
into
the
reasonableness
of
all
operating
expenses
and
to
disallow
items
of
costs
which
are
imprudent.”
now,
this
is
very
important.
of
course
it’s
true.
imprudent
expenses
can
be
disallowed
and
they
sometimes
are
termed
as
excessive
or
not
reasonable
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
purchaser,
but
that
is
not
the
same
as
looking
at
it
from
the
point
view
of
the
seller
as
to
whether
a
seller’s
rate
is
just
and
reasonable
which
is
essentially
related
to
costs,
at
least
it’s
a
surrogate
for
cost
whether
it
has
to
be
based
expressly
on
cost
or
not.
on
the
other
hand,
the
prudency
reasonable
test
is
a
market
test,
the
very
test
which
is
not
permissible
as
a
basis
for
regulation
under
the
natural
gas
act.
now,
this
is
no
different
than
when
a
pipeline
purchases
steel
pipe.
the
pipeline
can’t
determine
what
the
costs
are
of
u.s.
steel.
the
question
of
whether
its
prudent
or
not
is
the
matter
of
whether
the
pipeline
has
exercised
reasonable
contracting
practices
and
has
paid
--
hasn’t
just
gone
out
to
the
layman,
paid
much
more
than
it
had
to
under
market
conditions.
now,
i
know
of
no
authority
and
this
is
where
i
want
to
get
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question,
mr.
boland,
i
know
of
no
authority
under
which
the
fpc
could
disallow
the
cost
based
on
a
--
anything
other
purchased
gas
expenses
in
a
pipeline
proceeding
on
other
--
anything
other
than
the
prudency
test
or
reasonableness
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
buyer
test.
the
only
exception
that
i
know
of
in
regulatory
annals
is
where
there
is
an
affiliation
question
where
the
seller
buys
from
its
affiliate,
then
you
can
get
the
cost
but
otherwise
it’s
a
market
test.
and
so
that
the
commission
has
to
rewrite
its
order
not
only
in
the
first
where
that
we
discussed,
but
also
has
to
rewrite
the
order
on
what
prudency
means
and
it
has
no
legal
authority
to
do
that
and
this
is
where
the
consumer
will
bear
the
brunt
because
the
test
isn’t
the
same
test.
now,
finally
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
the
regulation
that
they
are
promising
is
a
regulation
of
the
purchases
and
the
standard
that
they
are
setting
is
a
market
standard
which
is
not
the
proper
standard
for
what
is
a
just
and
reasonable
price.
and
the
prudency
test
is
not
a
proper
test
and
it’s
the
only
legal
test
for
determining
what
is
a
just
and
reasonable
price.
so,
they
are
saying
they’re
regulating,
but
the
practical
effect
is
that
the
nature
of
the
regulation
is
precisely
the
kind
of
regulation
that
did
exist
before
this
court’s
decision
in
phillips
in
1954.
it
doesn’t
change
one
iota,
notwithstanding
my
friends’
comments
in
their
reply
brief.
that
--
that
was
not
considered
regulation
under
the
natural
gas
act
so
that
--
i
think
that’s
my
answer
to
you
and
that
very
basic
to
it
though
is
that
there
just
is
no
authority,
whether
it
is
--
when
our
commission,
the
new
york
commission
regulates
a
distribution
company
or
the
federal
power
commission
relate
--
regulates
a
pipeline
company,
there's
no
basis
on
which
we
can
disallow
costs
simply
because
they
exceed
what
the
just
and
reasonable
level
would
have
been
for
the
seller.
it’s
a
prudency
test
and
that’s
all
the
authority
that
a
regulatory
commission
has
and
the
fpc
can
change
it
by
saying
it
has
some
other
authority
and
it’s
free.
the
commission’s
order
is
much
more
careful
as
to
its
authority
in
this
respect
i
would
say
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
i
think
yes,
inevitably
so.
an
issue
which
is
not
really
here,
but
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
--
mr.
peter
h.
schiff
well,
i
certainly
do
not
suggest
you
go
the
whole
way.
i
suggest
that
if
you
did
that
here,
you
do
it
with
respect
to
all
of
producer
regulation
and
i
suggest
that
--
after
18,
19
years
that
this
is
a
decision
to
be
made
in
congress.
there
has
been
various
bills
proposed
in
congress
for
deregulation.
that,
your
honors,
is
a
proper
forum
for
the
attempt
to
deregulate.
now,
i
think
this
is
what
the
commission
is
doing,
but
this
isn’t
the
right
forum.
i
want
to
say
with
respect
to
existing
contracts
that
the
commission
did
not
even
make
a
pretense
at
indirect
regulation,
under
existing
contracts
which
my
have
been
below
the
contract
price,
the
just
and
reasonable
price.
they
let
them
go
off,
let
them
be
passed
through,
no
indirect
regulation.
i
suggest
that
contrary
to
what
it
said
in
the
reply
brief
of
the
government
that
we
properly
raise
that.
thank
you
very
much.
