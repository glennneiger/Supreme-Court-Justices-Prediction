mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
they
concern
the
validity
of
certain
orders
of
the
federal
power
commission,
adopting
a
new
method
of
regulating
the
sales
of
natural
gas
producers
--
sales
by
natural
--
a
class
of
natural
--
small
natural
gas
producers
in
interstate
commerce.
following
my
argument
on
behalf
of
the
commission,
mr.
vaughan
will
argue
on
behalf
of
the
other
petitioners
for
approximately
five
minutes.
they
are
among
the
class
of
small
producers
that
are
affected
by
the
commission’s
orders
in
this
case.
it
is
now
almost
universally
recognized
that
we
are
experiencing
an
increasingly
critical
shortage
of
natural
gas.
the
orders
at
issue
in
this
case
are
part
of
the
federal
power
commission’s
vigorous
program
for
combating
that
shortage
by
encouraging
new
exploration
and
development
of
the
natural
gas
reserves
in
this
country.
the
orders
rest
on
the
commission’s
authority
under
section
16
of
the
natural
gas
act
which
gives
it
the
authority
to
classify
persons
within
its
jurisdiction
and
to
prescribe
different
requirements
for
different
classes.
the
class
involved
here
is
not
a
new
one.
the
commission
has
previously
given
specialized
rate
treatment
to
this
group
of
small
producers
and
this
court
held
in
the
permian
basin
case
that
“the
problems
in
public
functions
of
small
producers
differ
sufficiently
to
permit
their
separate
classification.”
those
problems
in
public
functions
were
described
in
some
detail
in
the
permian
opinion
and
the
facts
are
the
same
today.
small
producers
account
for
only
about
10%
to
15%
of
the
gas
that’s
transported
in
interstate
pipelines
and
their
prices
generally
follow
the
prices
that
large
producers
are
able
to
get
for
their
gas.
but
while
they
contribute
only
a
small
portion
of
the
interstate
gas,
they
have
traditionally
been
responsible
for
about
80%
of
the
exploratory
drilling,
much
of
it
in
the
areas
that
have
not
previously
been
explored
which
makes
it
a
highly
risky
operation.
the
result
is
as
this
court
stated
in
permian
and
i
quote
again,
“their
contribution
to
the
search
for
new
gas
reserves
is
significant,
but
it
is
made
at
correspondingly
greater
financial
risks
and
at
higher
unit
costs.
the
principle
impediment
to
the
small
producers’
exploratory
efforts
has
been
a
lack
of
adequate
financing.”
the
comments
submitted
to
the
commission
in
this
proceeding
for
example
at
page
84
of
the
appendix
suggest
that
small
producers
must
rely
principally
on
revenues
from
current
sales
in
order
to
finance
their
exploratory
activities.
that
is
so
because
the
hazards
of
their
exploration
are
such
that
it
makes
it
difficult
to
depend
upon
debt
financing
and
because
the
small
producers
unlike
the
large
producers
seldom
have
other
operations
to
generate
funds
that
they
can
use
for
exploration.
given
this
situation,
the
commission
devised
in
this
rulemaking
proceeding,
a
new
regulatory
program
designed
to
take
advantage
of
the
small
producers’
unique
situation.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
that
this
court
has
before
it
only
the
orders
that
would
setup
a
program.
it
is
not
reviewing
any
order
applying
this
program
to
the
facts
of
any
particular
case.
the
court’s
review
consequently
is
a
limited
one.
the
only
question
is
whether
the
act
prohibits
the
commission
from
experimenting
along
the
lines
that
it
has
chosen
to
follow.
and
this
court
has
stated
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
one
which
challenges
the
validity
of
orders
of
the
federal
power
commission
bears
a
heavy
burden
of
showing
that
it
will
lead
unjust
and
unreasonable
results.
the
power
commission’s
plan
has
these
features.
first,
instead
of
following
the
ordinary
procedure
of
having
each
new
sale
of
natural
gas
certificated
in
the
public
conven
--
as
in
the
public
convenience
and
necessity,
small
producers
are
granted
a
blanket
certificate
which
covers
all
sales
up
to
a
stated
maximum
annual
volume.
this
particular
feature
is
not
a
new
one
either.
a
similar
blanket
certificate
procedure
was
established
as
part
of
the
permian
proceeding
and
was
approved
by
the
court
in
principal
in
that
case.
second,
the
small
producer
acting
under
this
blanket
certificate
may
sell
gas
at
whatever
contract
price
he
is
able
to
negotiate
even
if
it
is
higher
than
the
area
wide
maximum
rates
that
have
been
established
by
the
commission
as
just
and
reasonable
for
other
purposes.
now
this
aspect
of
the
order
is
new.
the
prior
blanket
certificate
procedure
--
permitted
sales
at
rates
up
to
area
maximum,
but
not
higher.
the
purpose
in
this
order
was
to
give
some
play
to
market
forces
to
see
whether
prices
would
in
fact
exceed
the
area
maximums
and
if
so
whether
they
would
make
it
more
attractive
and
more
feasible
for
the
small
producers
to
engage
in
the
kind
of
exploratory
drilling
that
been
its
history.
a
third
feature
of
the
order
is
that
in
order
to
permit
the
small
producer
to
rely
on
his
current
revenues
and
planning
his
exploratory
program,
the
rates
that
are
collected
under
the
contracts
are
not
subject
to
refund,
even
if
the
commission
later
determines
that
the
rates
were
un
--
were
higher
than
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
now
this
is
in
effect
is
an
advanced
determination
by
the
commission
that
it
will
serve
the
public
interest
to
announce
that
it
will
not
suspend
and
make
subject
to
refund
the
new
rates
filed
by
--
new
rates
in
the
new
small
producer
contracts,
but
rather
will
limit
itself
to
acting
prospectively
under
section
5
of
the
natural
gas
act
to
reduce
any
rate
that
it
concludes
is
unreasonably
high.
under
the
commission’s
plan,
its
review
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
small
producers'
rates
will
take
place
not
in
a
producer
proceeding,
but
rather
subsequently
in
a
pipeline
proceeding.
under
the
plan,
the
pipelines
are
authorized
to
track
the
increased
rates
resulting
from
the
new
small
producer
contracts.
the
tracking
proceeding
in
which
the
pipelines
seeks
to
pass
on
the
increased
rates
to
its
customers
is
the
one
in
which
the
commission
will
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
underlying
small
producer
rates.
the
pipeline
is
required
under
the
orders
to
show
that
its
operating
expenses,
all
of
its
operating
expenses,
in
this
case
particularly
its,
purchased
gas
costs
are
not
unreasonably
high.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
there's
no
--
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
small
producer
refund
to
the
pipeline.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
determination
is
made
that
the
rates
are
unreasonably
high,
the
pipeline
is
not
permitted
to
pass
on
those
increased
rates
to
its
customers.
this
serves
as
a
bond
or
protection
for
the
ultimate
consumer
who
thereby
avoids
having
to
bear
the
brunt
of
any
unreasonably
high
rates.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
judge
fay,
he
concluded
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
strike
the
no
refund
aspects
of
the
--
of
this
order.
but
really,
that
would
destroy
the
heart
of
the
program
because,
the
ref
--
the
no
refund
assurance
to
the
small
producer
is
what
the
commission
is
hoping
will
give
him
a
sense
of
security
in
his
current
revenues
that
will
permit
him
to
make
the
planning
that’s
necessary.
at
the
same
time
it
has
the
very
important
function
of
giving
an
incentive
to
the
pipeline
to
bargain
the
prices
down.
what
the
commission
has
done
is
--
has
freed
the
small
producers
and
the
pipelines
to
negotiate
rates
higher
than
the
area
maximum,
but
they
wanted
to
leave
some
bite
to
the
market
forces
that
would
otherwise
be
--
would
be
applied.
and
if
the
pipeline
is
sure
that
it
could
it
always
either
pass
on
its
rates
that
are
increased
or
get
refunds
if
they’re
ultimately
determined
to
be
unreasonably
high,
it
has
a
free
passage
and
it
needn’t
be
terribly
concerned
about
the
rates
barring,
you
know,
the
ultimate
consumer,
if
it’s
running
into
problems
with
other
forms
of
energy.
of
course
there
are
of
different
problems
if
they're
on
the
line,
but
ordinarily
he’s
not
going
to
be
in
that
situation.
so,
the
no
refund
assurance
is
really
at
the
very
heart
of
this
program
and
without
it
i
don’t
think
the
program
has
it
all
the
--
the
meat
that
the
commission
it
intended
to
have.
well,
the
result
of
the
features
as
i’ve
described
them
is
that
the
small
producer
is
assured
that
his
current
revenues
are
not
subject
to
refunds
so
that
he
can
rely
on
them
in
making
his
plans
for
exploration.
the
pipeline
which
faces
this
risk
of
absorbing
the
losses
if
it
enters
into
contracts,
they’re
unreasonably
high,
has
an
incentive
to
bargain
the
prices
down.
and
finally,
the
consumer
whose
protection,
the
act
is
principally
designed,
to
assure
is
fully
protected
because
there
is
no
--
because
no
unreasonably
high
small
producer
rates
will
be
permitted
to
be
passed
on
by
the
pipeline.
now,
the
plan
is
without
doubt
an
experimental
one
and
the
commission
intends
to
monitor
closely
the
results
under
the
plan.
in
particular,
it
stated
at
page
145
of
the
appendix
that
if
it
finds
the
program
as
adverse,
the
--
affecting
the
interest
of
consumers,
it
will
take
appropriate
corrective
action.
the
commission’s
plan
is
attacked
in
a
variety
of
grounds,
but
they
can
properly
redo
--
be
reduced
i
think
to
three.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
small
producers,
mr.
justice
are
defined,
i’m
not
sure
where
in
the
order,
but
they’re
defined
similar
--
similarly
to
the
way
they
were
defined
in
the
permian
case
to
include
all
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
oh!
they’re
defined
to
include
producers
whose
annual
sales
in
interstate
commerce
are
below
the
level
of
10,000,000
mcf,
that
is
thousand
cubic
feet
of
natural
gas.
the
first
argument
that’s
made
against
the
validity
of
the
commission’s
order
is
that
it
abandons
the
statutory
standard
of
just
and
reasonable
rates
and
this
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
relied
in
setting
aside
the
order.
the
second
argument
is
that
the
act
does
not
permit
rate
review
in
this
indirect
manner
that
is
postponing
the
review
until
the
pipeline
proceeding;
and
finally,
its
claim
that
the
plan
is
unfair
to
the
large
producers
and
pipelines
who
purchase
gas
from
small
producers.
the
commission’s
order
specified
that
its
review
of
the
small
producer,
the
reasonableness
of
small
producer’s
rates
in
the
pipeline
proceedings
would
be
in
accordance
with
this
--
with
a
standard
that
i
think
it
might
be
worth
looking
at
closely,
it
appears
at
page
142
of
the
appendix.
it
stated
there
slightly
below
the
middle
of
the
page
that
the
standard
will
be
whether
or
not
the
small
producers’
rate,
that
is
the
increase
that
the
pipeline
seeks
to
pass
on,
is
unreasonably
high
considering
appropriate
comparisons
with
highest
contract
prices
for
sales
by
large
producers
or
the
prevailing
market
price
for
intrastate
sales
in
the
same
producing
area.
the
court
of
appeals
thought
this
was
a
departure
from
the
statutory
just
and
reasonable
standard
because
it
erroneously
assumed
that
the
commission
was
tying
its
reasonableness
determination
exclusively
to
the
two
market
factors
that
the
order
mentioned,
namely,
the
highest
contract
prices
and
the
prevailing
intrastate
rates,
neither
of
which
of
course
the
commission
regulates.
this
reliance
upon
this
reading
of
the
order
is
made
clear
by
the
court
of
appeals
at
page
12
(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
we
don’t
take
the
position
here
that
an
order
tying
reasonableness
to
those
factors
would
never
be
appropriate.
in
fact
this
court
in
permian
suggested
that
in
proper
circumstances,
it
might
be
appropriate,
but
we
do
say
this
is
not
what
the
commission
did
in
this
case.
the
order
does
not
suggest
that
the
two
factors
that
the
commission
identified
would
be
the
only
ones
that
will
be
taken
into
consideration.
the
standard
is
one
of
unreason
--
whether
the
rate
is
unreasonably
high
and
the
commission
emphasized
that
it
would
consider
all
relevant
factors.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
that’s
right.
it’s
not
the
model
of
clarity,
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
it’s
in
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
they
didn’t
read
it
that
way,
but
i
think
it
was
an
incorrect
reading.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
commission
believes
that
the
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
commission
certainly
had
that
option
at
one
point,
it
doesn’t
have
it
at
this
point.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
but
there
is
a
substantial
problem
of
delay
here.
the
commission
believed
that
if
the
order
was
clear
enough
and
that
there
was
no
need
to
remedy
any
ambiguities
with
this
--
after
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
and
the
--
to
take
it
back
and
start
all
over
would
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
one
way.
this
court
in
the
sense
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
in
the
sense
there
is
no,
you
know,
if
the
court
construes
it
the
way
we
suggest
it
should
be
construed,
that’s
what
the
order
means.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
well,
while
there
is
some
ambiguity
that
i
have
to
concede.
it
seems
to
reasonably
clear
that
while
prevailing
market
prices
are
unquestionably
among
the
factors
that
it
be
--
are
to
be
taken
into
account,
the
commission
has
not
indicated
that
it
is
the
only
considerations
that
would
be
taken
into
account
and
for
that
reason
it's
not
--
the
standard
is
not
an
abandonment
of
the
statutory
just
and
reasonable
standard.
the
second
issue
is
whether
there
is
anything
in
the
act
to
prohibit
the
kind
of
indirect
regulatory
scheme
that
the
commission
adopted
in
this
case.
the
respondents
argue
that
the
act
requires
direct
review
in
a
pipeline
proceeding,
but
they
have
pointed
to
nothing
in
the
act
that
so
specifies
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
in
power
commission
cases
that
under
the
just
and
reasonable
standard,
it
is
the
result
that
matters
and
not
the
regulatory
method
that’s
used.
since
this
scheme
in
our
view
is
reasonably
designed
to
result
in
just
and
reasonable
rates,
it
does
not
matter
that
the
indirect
method
is
the
one
that
is
used
and
it
does
not
matter
that
the
commission
has
departed
from
its
prior
practice
of
viewing
these
matters
in
direct
proceedings
in
producer
proceedings.
in
fact
this
court
in
the
sunray
dx
case
391
u.s.
upheld
a
similar
indirect
regulatory
scheme.
the
issue
there
was
whether
the
commission
was
required
under
the
act
to
consider
in
a
producer
certificate
proceeding
whether
there
was
a
public
need
for
the
gas
contracted
for.
the
court
upheld
the
commission’s
determination
that
the
question
could
more
appropriately
be
considered
in
the
pipeline
proceeding
and
the
court
held
that
the
act
requires
no
more
than
that
there’d
be
an
adequate
forum
in
which
the
issue
is
to
be
ventilated
and
that
the
pipeline
proceeding
was
an
adequate
form
in
which
to
ventilate
it.
finally
the
pipelines
argue
that
the
commission’s
plan
will
be
unfair
to
them
because
it
will
impose
upon
them
what
they
refer
to
as
no
burdens
and
due
risks
and
because
the
reasonableness
standard
articulated
in
the
order
in
their
view
is
to
vague.
the
fact
is,
however,
that
the
pipelines
have
always
borne
the
risk
that
an
operating
expanse
will
be
deemed
by
the
commission
to
be
unreasonably
high.
in
the
past,
the
commission
has
not
required
special
justification
of
purchased
gas
costs
because
it
was
clear
at
that
point
that
the
cost
were
reasonable,
the
commission
having
already
made
that
determination.
but
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
the
pipeline
has
by
virtue
of
this
practice
and
tradition
become
insulated
to
closer
scrutiny
of
those
purchased
gas
costs
where
their
reasonableness
has
not
been
determined
in
advance.
the
commission
here
has
not
invented
a
new
burden
or
risk.
it
has
simply
highlighted
an
existing
one.
there's
no
question
that
the
pipelines
would
be
happier
were
they
guaranteed
the
right
to
pass
on
any
rates
that
they
were
able
to
negotiate
with
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
with
respect
to
the
producer
rates,
it
does
permit
refunds
if
the
pipelines
file
for
an
increase
to
pass
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
correct.
now
that
does
not
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
right
and,
you
know,
the
act
does
not
require
the
commission
to
order
refunds
in
any
case.
it’s
wholly
within
the
commission’s
discretion.
i
don’t
even
believe
that
it’s
a
matter
that
can
be
reviewed
by
the
courts
whether
in
a
particular
case
a
raise
should
be
suspended
and
made
subject
to
refund.
and
what
the
commission
has
done
here
is
made
that
determination,
exercised
its
discretion
with
respect
to
a
class
of
the
sales.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
under
the
natural
gas
act?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
don’t
believe
there
is.
i
frankly
confess
ignorance.
i've
never
seen
one
so
i
assume
there's
not.
i
believe
it
--
that
the
commission
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
guess
right,
except
i
suppose
the
commission
could,
by
rule
make
--
oh!
for
their
independent,
no,
i
agree
but
i
don’t
believe
that
there
is
such
a
private
cause
of
action.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
right.
i
believe
the
only
way
that
a
refund
is
going
to
be
ordered
under
the
natural
gas
act
is
by
the
commission
in
a
proceeding
under
section
4
(e)
of
the
act.
i
know
of
no
other
basis
for
refunds.
finally,
the
pipelines
claim
that
the
standard
is
too
vague
for
them
to
apply,
but
that
claim
really
is
in
the
present
posture
one
that
could
be
made
with
respect
to
any
standard
that
has
not
yet
been
applied.
in
fact
the
statutory
just
and
reasonable
standard
could
be
certainly
attacked
on
the
same
ground
as
being
too
vague.
the
problem
is,
we’re
dealing
with
the
standard
in
the
abstract
and
the
commission
has
indicated
two
of
the
factors
that
it
will
take
special
account
of
in
making
its
reasonableness
determination.
the
only
way
to
find
out
whether
the
standard
is
really
clear
enough
to
be
workable
is
to
let
it
be
put
into
practice
and
to
see
what
happens.
the
commission
of
course
must
be
judged
in
the
end
by
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
the
results
that
ensue
under
the
act.
but
it's
not
at
this
point,
there
is
no
reason
to
anticipate
that
the
standard
here
will
be
so
unworkable
that
the
commission
should
not
be
permitted
to
put
it
into
effect
on
an
experimental
basis.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
let
me
respond
first
to
the
question
that
--
what
the
commission
has
been
doing
in
the
interim
since
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case.
prior
to
the
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
commission
had
been
issuing
certificates
under
the
order.
when
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
order,
the
commission
ceased
issuing
permanent
certificates
under
the
order
and
begun
issuing
what
they
called
temporary
certificates
which
in
effect
leave
the
matter
entirely
open,
pending
ultimate
disposition.
the
--
they
are
--
the
certificates
that
have
been
issued
since
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
have
a
condition
--
had
a
condition
that
the
producer
will
be
subject
to
refund
if
the
court,
if
this
court
ultimately
determines
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct.
along
the
same
lines,
it’s
very
difficult
to
--
for
me
understand
the
argument
that
we
have
had
three
years
to
experiment.
these
three
years
have
been
years
of
obvious
uncertainty
which
is
exactly
what
the
order
is
designed
to
eliminate
until
judicial
review
is
at
the
end
there
is
no
fair
basis
for
judging
whether
the
order
will
have
the
intended
effects.
mr.
schiff
has
emphasized
to
some
degree
that
the
market
is
--
the
market
prices
are
not
the
proper
test
for
just
and
reasonable
rates.
we
don’t
say
that
that’s
the
case.
we
don’t
argue
that
the
commission
has
used
it,
but
i
might
point
out
that
this
court
in
the
sunray
dx
case
said
that
the
true
market
price
is
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
the
problem
with
the
natural
gas
industry
is
that
pipelines
have
traditionally
been
permitted
to
pass
on
their
purchased
gas
costs
in
the
form
of
increased
rates
and
as
a
consequence
there
has
been
no
incentive
for
the
pipeline
to
bargain
the
prices
down.
well,
the
purpose
of
the
commission’s
order
among
other
things
is
to
give
some
sense
of
reality
to
the
market
here
and
make
it
more
of
a
genuine
market.
so
to
that
extent
we
have
--
we
contemplate
--
the
commission
contemplates
something
approaching,
a
true
market
price
which
would
be
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
and
i
might
add
also
that
this
court
in
permian
made
it
quite
plain
that
it
was
permissible
for
the
commission
to
take
into
account
market
factors
in
determining
the
just
and
reasonable
rates.
finally,
there
seems
to
be
a
suggestion
to
mr.
schiff’s
argument
that
the
standard
of
prudence
is
something
that
inheres
in
the
constitution.
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
that
the
commission
apply
a
prudent
standard.
the
constitutional
limit
is
one
of
confiscation,
that’s
all.
the
statutory
standard
is
what
matters
here
and
that
standard
is
just
and
reasonable
and
that
is
the
standard
that
the
commission
intends
to
apply
when
it
reviews
the
small
producers’
rates
at
the
pipeline
level.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
cases
are
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
they
concern
the
validity
of
certain
orders
of
the
federal
power
commission,
adopting
a
new
method
of
regulating
the
sales
of
natural
gas
producers
--
sales
by
natural
--
a
class
of
natural
--
small
natural
gas
producers
in
interstate
commerce.
following
my
argument
on
behalf
of
the
commission,
mr.
vaughan
will
argue
on
behalf
of
the
other
petitioners
for
approximately
five
minutes.
they
are
among
the
class
of
small
producers
that
are
affected
by
the
commission’s
orders
in
this
case.
it
is
now
almost
universally
recognized
that
we
are
experiencing
an
increasingly
critical
shortage
of
natural
gas.
the
orders
at
issue
in
this
case
are
part
of
the
federal
power
commission’s
vigorous
program
for
combating
that
shortage
by
encouraging
new
exploration
and
development
of
the
natural
gas
reserves
in
this
country.
the
orders
rest
on
the
commission’s
authority
under
section
16
of
the
natural
gas
act
which
gives
it
the
authority
to
classify
persons
within
its
jurisdiction
and
to
prescribe
different
requirements
for
different
classes.
the
class
involved
here
is
not
a
new
one.
the
commission
has
previously
given
specialized
rate
treatment
to
this
group
of
small
producers
and
this
court
held
in
the
permian
basin
case
that
“the
problems
in
public
functions
of
small
producers
differ
sufficiently
to
permit
their
separate
classification.”
those
problems
in
public
functions
were
described
in
some
detail
in
the
permian
opinion
and
the
facts
are
the
same
today.
small
producers
account
for
only
about
10%
to
15%
of
the
gas
that’s
transported
in
interstate
pipelines
and
their
prices
generally
follow
the
prices
that
large
producers
are
able
to
get
for
their
gas.
but
while
they
contribute
only
a
small
portion
of
the
interstate
gas,
they
have
traditionally
been
responsible
for
about
80%
of
the
exploratory
drilling,
much
of
it
in
the
areas
that
have
not
previously
been
explored
which
makes
it
a
highly
risky
operation.
the
result
is
as
this
court
stated
in
permian
and
i
quote
again,
“their
contribution
to
the
search
for
new
gas
reserves
is
significant,
but
it
is
made
at
correspondingly
greater
financial
risks
and
at
higher
unit
costs.
the
principle
impediment
to
the
small
producers’
exploratory
efforts
has
been
a
lack
of
adequate
financing.”
the
comments
submitted
to
the
commission
in
this
proceeding
for
example
at
page
84
of
the
appendix
suggest
that
small
producers
must
rely
principally
on
revenues
from
current
sales
in
order
to
finance
their
exploratory
activities.
that
is
so
because
the
hazards
of
their
exploration
are
such
that
it
makes
it
difficult
to
depend
upon
debt
financing
and
because
the
small
producers
unlike
the
large
producers
seldom
have
other
operations
to
generate
funds
that
they
can
use
for
exploration.
given
this
situation,
the
commission
devised
in
this
rulemaking
proceeding,
a
new
regulatory
program
designed
to
take
advantage
of
the
small
producers’
unique
situation.
i
want
to
emphasize
that
that
this
court
has
before
it
only
the
orders
that
would
setup
a
program.
it
is
not
reviewing
any
order
applying
this
program
to
the
facts
of
any
particular
case.
the
court’s
review
consequently
is
a
limited
one.
the
only
question
is
whether
the
act
prohibits
the
commission
from
experimenting
along
the
lines
that
it
has
chosen
to
follow.
and
this
court
has
stated
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
one
which
challenges
the
validity
of
orders
of
the
federal
power
commission
bears
a
heavy
burden
of
showing
that
it
will
lead
unjust
and
unreasonable
results.
the
power
commission’s
plan
has
these
features.
first,
instead
of
following
the
ordinary
procedure
of
having
each
new
sale
of
natural
gas
certificated
in
the
public
conven
--
as
in
the
public
convenience
and
necessity,
small
producers
are
granted
a
blanket
certificate
which
covers
all
sales
up
to
a
stated
maximum
annual
volume.
this
particular
feature
is
not
a
new
one
either.
a
similar
blanket
certificate
procedure
was
established
as
part
of
the
permian
proceeding
and
was
approved
by
the
court
in
principal
in
that
case.
second,
the
small
producer
acting
under
this
blanket
certificate
may
sell
gas
at
whatever
contract
price
he
is
able
to
negotiate
even
if
it
is
higher
than
the
area
wide
maximum
rates
that
have
been
established
by
the
commission
as
just
and
reasonable
for
other
purposes.
now
this
aspect
of
the
order
is
new.
the
prior
blanket
certificate
procedure
--
permitted
sales
at
rates
up
to
area
maximum,
but
not
higher.
the
purpose
in
this
order
was
to
give
some
play
to
market
forces
to
see
whether
prices
would
in
fact
exceed
the
area
maximums
and
if
so
whether
they
would
make
it
more
attractive
and
more
feasible
for
the
small
producers
to
engage
in
the
kind
of
exploratory
drilling
that
been
its
history.
a
third
feature
of
the
order
is
that
in
order
to
permit
the
small
producer
to
rely
on
his
current
revenues
and
planning
his
exploratory
program,
the
rates
that
are
collected
under
the
contracts
are
not
subject
to
refund,
even
if
the
commission
later
determines
that
the
rates
were
un
--
were
higher
than
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
now
this
is
in
effect
is
an
advanced
determination
by
the
commission
that
it
will
serve
the
public
interest
to
announce
that
it
will
not
suspend
and
make
subject
to
refund
the
new
rates
filed
by
--
new
rates
in
the
new
small
producer
contracts,
but
rather
will
limit
itself
to
acting
prospectively
under
section
5
of
the
natural
gas
act
to
reduce
any
rate
that
it
concludes
is
unreasonably
high.
under
the
commission’s
plan,
its
review
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
small
producers'
rates
will
take
place
not
in
a
producer
proceeding,
but
rather
subsequently
in
a
pipeline
proceeding.
under
the
plan,
the
pipelines
are
authorized
to
track
the
increased
rates
resulting
from
the
new
small
producer
contracts.
the
tracking
proceeding
in
which
the
pipelines
seeks
to
pass
on
the
increased
rates
to
its
customers
is
the
one
in
which
the
commission
will
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
underlying
small
producer
rates.
the
pipeline
is
required
under
the
orders
to
show
that
its
operating
expenses,
all
of
its
operating
expenses,
in
this
case
particularly
its,
purchased
gas
costs
are
not
unreasonably
high.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
there's
no
--
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
small
producer
refund
to
the
pipeline.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
determination
is
made
that
the
rates
are
unreasonably
high,
the
pipeline
is
not
permitted
to
pass
on
those
increased
rates
to
its
customers.
this
serves
as
a
bond
or
protection
for
the
ultimate
consumer
who
thereby
avoids
having
to
bear
the
brunt
of
any
unreasonably
high
rates.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well
judge
fay,
he
concluded
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
strike
the
no
refund
aspects
of
the
--
of
this
order.
but
really,
that
would
destroy
the
heart
of
the
program
because,
the
ref
--
the
no
refund
assurance
to
the
small
producer
is
what
the
commission
is
hoping
will
give
him
a
sense
of
security
in
his
current
revenues
that
will
permit
him
to
make
the
planning
that’s
necessary.
at
the
same
time
it
has
the
very
important
function
of
giving
an
incentive
to
the
pipeline
to
bargain
the
prices
down.
what
the
commission
has
done
is
--
has
freed
the
small
producers
and
the
pipelines
to
negotiate
rates
higher
than
the
area
maximum,
but
they
wanted
to
leave
some
bite
to
the
market
forces
that
would
otherwise
be
--
would
be
applied.
and
if
the
pipeline
is
sure
that
it
could
it
always
either
pass
on
its
rates
that
are
increased
or
get
refunds
if
they’re
ultimately
determined
to
be
unreasonably
high,
it
has
a
free
passage
and
it
needn’t
be
terribly
concerned
about
the
rates
barring,
you
know,
the
ultimate
consumer,
if
it’s
running
into
problems
with
other
forms
of
energy.
of
course
there
are
of
different
problems
if
they're
on
the
line,
but
ordinarily
he’s
not
going
to
be
in
that
situation.
so,
the
no
refund
assurance
is
really
at
the
very
heart
of
this
program
and
without
it
i
don’t
think
the
program
has
it
all
the
--
the
meat
that
the
commission
it
intended
to
have.
well,
the
result
of
the
features
as
i’ve
described
them
is
that
the
small
producer
is
assured
that
his
current
revenues
are
not
subject
to
refunds
so
that
he
can
rely
on
them
in
making
his
plans
for
exploration.
the
pipeline
which
faces
this
risk
of
absorbing
the
losses
if
it
enters
into
contracts,
they’re
unreasonably
high,
has
an
incentive
to
bargain
the
prices
down.
and
finally,
the
consumer
whose
protection,
the
act
is
principally
designed,
to
assure
is
fully
protected
because
there
is
no
--
because
no
unreasonably
high
small
producer
rates
will
be
permitted
to
be
passed
on
by
the
pipeline.
now,
the
plan
is
without
doubt
an
experimental
one
and
the
commission
intends
to
monitor
closely
the
results
under
the
plan.
in
particular,
it
stated
at
page
145
of
the
appendix
that
if
it
finds
the
program
as
adverse,
the
--
affecting
the
interest
of
consumers,
it
will
take
appropriate
corrective
action.
the
commission’s
plan
is
attacked
in
a
variety
of
grounds,
but
they
can
properly
redo
--
be
reduced
i
think
to
three.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
small
producers,
mr.
justice
are
defined,
i’m
not
sure
where
in
the
order,
but
they’re
defined
similar
--
similarly
to
the
way
they
were
defined
in
the
permian
case
to
include
all
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
oh!
they’re
defined
to
include
producers
whose
annual
sales
in
interstate
commerce
are
below
the
level
of
10,000,000
mcf,
that
is
thousand
cubic
feet
of
natural
gas.
the
first
argument
that’s
made
against
the
validity
of
the
commission’s
order
is
that
it
abandons
the
statutory
standard
of
just
and
reasonable
rates
and
this
is
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
of
appeals
relied
in
setting
aside
the
order.
the
second
argument
is
that
the
act
does
not
permit
rate
review
in
this
indirect
manner
that
is
postponing
the
review
until
the
pipeline
proceeding;
and
finally,
its
claim
that
the
plan
is
unfair
to
the
large
producers
and
pipelines
who
purchase
gas
from
small
producers.
the
commission’s
order
specified
that
its
review
of
the
small
producer,
the
reasonableness
of
small
producer’s
rates
in
the
pipeline
proceedings
would
be
in
accordance
with
this
--
with
a
standard
that
i
think
it
might
be
worth
looking
at
closely,
it
appears
at
page
142
of
the
appendix.
it
stated
there
slightly
below
the
middle
of
the
page
that
the
standard
will
be
whether
or
not
the
small
producers’
rate,
that
is
the
increase
that
the
pipeline
seeks
to
pass
on,
is
unreasonably
high
considering
appropriate
comparisons
with
highest
contract
prices
for
sales
by
large
producers
or
the
prevailing
market
price
for
intrastate
sales
in
the
same
producing
area.
the
court
of
appeals
thought
this
was
a
departure
from
the
statutory
just
and
reasonable
standard
because
it
erroneously
assumed
that
the
commission
was
tying
its
reasonableness
determination
exclusively
to
the
two
market
factors
that
the
order
mentioned,
namely,
the
highest
contract
prices
and
the
prevailing
intrastate
rates,
neither
of
which
of
course
the
commission
regulates.
this
reliance
upon
this
reading
of
the
order
is
made
clear
by
the
court
of
appeals
at
page
12
(a)
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
we
don’t
take
the
position
here
that
an
order
tying
reasonableness
to
those
factors
would
never
be
appropriate.
in
fact
this
court
in
permian
suggested
that
in
proper
circumstances,
it
might
be
appropriate,
but
we
do
say
this
is
not
what
the
commission
did
in
this
case.
the
order
does
not
suggest
that
the
two
factors
that
the
commission
identified
would
be
the
only
ones
that
will
be
taken
into
consideration.
the
standard
is
one
of
unreason
--
whether
the
rate
is
unreasonably
high
and
the
commission
emphasized
that
it
would
consider
all
relevant
factors.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
that’s
right.
it’s
not
the
model
of
clarity,
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
it’s
in
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
they
didn’t
read
it
that
way,
but
i
think
it
was
an
incorrect
reading.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
commission
believes
that
the
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
commission
certainly
had
that
option
at
one
point,
it
doesn’t
have
it
at
this
point.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
but
there
is
a
substantial
problem
of
delay
here.
the
commission
believed
that
if
the
order
was
clear
enough
and
that
there
was
no
need
to
remedy
any
ambiguities
with
this
--
after
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
and
the
--
to
take
it
back
and
start
all
over
would
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
one
way.
this
court
in
the
sense
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
in
the
sense
there
is
no,
you
know,
if
the
court
construes
it
the
way
we
suggest
it
should
be
construed,
that’s
what
the
order
means.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
well,
while
there
is
some
ambiguity
that
i
have
to
concede.
it
seems
to
reasonably
clear
that
while
prevailing
market
prices
are
unquestionably
among
the
factors
that
it
be
--
are
to
be
taken
into
account,
the
commission
has
not
indicated
that
it
is
the
only
considerations
that
would
be
taken
into
account
and
for
that
reason
it's
not
--
the
standard
is
not
an
abandonment
of
the
statutory
just
and
reasonable
standard.
the
second
issue
is
whether
there
is
anything
in
the
act
to
prohibit
the
kind
of
indirect
regulatory
scheme
that
the
commission
adopted
in
this
case.
the
respondents
argue
that
the
act
requires
direct
review
in
a
pipeline
proceeding,
but
they
have
pointed
to
nothing
in
the
act
that
so
specifies
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
in
power
commission
cases
that
under
the
just
and
reasonable
standard,
it
is
the
result
that
matters
and
not
the
regulatory
method
that’s
used.
since
this
scheme
in
our
view
is
reasonably
designed
to
result
in
just
and
reasonable
rates,
it
does
not
matter
that
the
indirect
method
is
the
one
that
is
used
and
it
does
not
matter
that
the
commission
has
departed
from
its
prior
practice
of
viewing
these
matters
in
direct
proceedings
in
producer
proceedings.
in
fact
this
court
in
the
sunray
dx
case
391
u.s.
upheld
a
similar
indirect
regulatory
scheme.
the
issue
there
was
whether
the
commission
was
required
under
the
act
to
consider
in
a
producer
certificate
proceeding
whether
there
was
a
public
need
for
the
gas
contracted
for.
the
court
upheld
the
commission’s
determination
that
the
question
could
more
appropriately
be
considered
in
the
pipeline
proceeding
and
the
court
held
that
the
act
requires
no
more
than
that
there’d
be
an
adequate
forum
in
which
the
issue
is
to
be
ventilated
and
that
the
pipeline
proceeding
was
an
adequate
form
in
which
to
ventilate
it.
finally
the
pipelines
argue
that
the
commission’s
plan
will
be
unfair
to
them
because
it
will
impose
upon
them
what
they
refer
to
as
no
burdens
and
due
risks
and
because
the
reasonableness
standard
articulated
in
the
order
in
their
view
is
to
vague.
the
fact
is,
however,
that
the
pipelines
have
always
borne
the
risk
that
an
operating
expanse
will
be
deemed
by
the
commission
to
be
unreasonably
high.
in
the
past,
the
commission
has
not
required
special
justification
of
purchased
gas
costs
because
it
was
clear
at
that
point
that
the
cost
were
reasonable,
the
commission
having
already
made
that
determination.
but
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
the
pipeline
has
by
virtue
of
this
practice
and
tradition
become
insulated
to
closer
scrutiny
of
those
purchased
gas
costs
where
their
reasonableness
has
not
been
determined
in
advance.
the
commission
here
has
not
invented
a
new
burden
or
risk.
it
has
simply
highlighted
an
existing
one.
there's
no
question
that
the
pipelines
would
be
happier
were
they
guaranteed
the
right
to
pass
on
any
rates
that
they
were
able
to
negotiate
with
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
with
respect
to
the
producer
rates,
it
does
permit
refunds
if
the
pipelines
file
for
an
increase
to
pass
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes
sir.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
correct.
now
that
does
not
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
right
and,
you
know,
the
act
does
not
require
the
commission
to
order
refunds
in
any
case.
it’s
wholly
within
the
commission’s
discretion.
i
don’t
even
believe
that
it’s
a
matter
that
can
be
reviewed
by
the
courts
whether
in
a
particular
case
a
raise
should
be
suspended
and
made
subject
to
refund.
and
what
the
commission
has
done
here
is
made
that
determination,
exercised
its
discretion
with
respect
to
a
class
of
the
sales.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
under
the
natural
gas
act?
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
don’t
believe
there
is.
i
frankly
confess
ignorance.
i've
never
seen
one
so
i
assume
there's
not.
i
believe
it
--
that
the
commission
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
guess
right,
except
i
suppose
the
commission
could,
by
rule
make
--
oh!
for
their
independent,
no,
i
agree
but
i
don’t
believe
that
there
is
such
a
private
cause
of
action.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
right.
i
believe
the
only
way
that
a
refund
is
going
to
be
ordered
under
the
natural
gas
act
is
by
the
commission
in
a
proceeding
under
section
4
(e)
of
the
act.
i
know
of
no
other
basis
for
refunds.
finally,
the
pipelines
claim
that
the
standard
is
too
vague
for
them
to
apply,
but
that
claim
really
is
in
the
present
posture
one
that
could
be
made
with
respect
to
any
standard
that
has
not
yet
been
applied.
in
fact
the
statutory
just
and
reasonable
standard
could
be
certainly
attacked
on
the
same
ground
as
being
too
vague.
the
problem
is,
we’re
dealing
with
the
standard
in
the
abstract
and
the
commission
has
indicated
two
of
the
factors
that
it
will
take
special
account
of
in
making
its
reasonableness
determination.
the
only
way
to
find
out
whether
the
standard
is
really
clear
enough
to
be
workable
is
to
let
it
be
put
into
practice
and
to
see
what
happens.
the
commission
of
course
must
be
judged
in
the
end
by
the
justness
and
reasonableness
of
the
results
that
ensue
under
the
act.
but
it's
not
at
this
point,
there
is
no
reason
to
anticipate
that
the
standard
here
will
be
so
unworkable
that
the
commission
should
not
be
permitted
to
put
it
into
effect
on
an
experimental
basis.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
let
me
respond
first
to
the
question
that
--
what
the
commission
has
been
doing
in
the
interim
since
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case.
prior
to
the
decision
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
commission
had
been
issuing
certificates
under
the
order.
when
the
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
order,
the
commission
ceased
issuing
permanent
certificates
under
the
order
and
begun
issuing
what
they
called
temporary
certificates
which
in
effect
leave
the
matter
entirely
open,
pending
ultimate
disposition.
the
--
they
are
--
the
certificates
that
have
been
issued
since
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
have
a
condition
--
had
a
condition
that
the
producer
will
be
subject
to
refund
if
the
court,
if
this
court
ultimately
determines
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct.
along
the
same
lines,
it’s
very
difficult
to
--
for
me
understand
the
argument
that
we
have
had
three
years
to
experiment.
these
three
years
have
been
years
of
obvious
uncertainty
which
is
exactly
what
the
order
is
designed
to
eliminate
until
judicial
review
is
at
the
end
there
is
no
fair
basis
for
judging
whether
the
order
will
have
the
intended
effects.
mr.
schiff
has
emphasized
to
some
degree
that
the
market
is
--
the
market
prices
are
not
the
proper
test
for
just
and
reasonable
rates.
we
don’t
say
that
that’s
the
case.
we
don’t
argue
that
the
commission
has
used
it,
but
i
might
point
out
that
this
court
in
the
sunray
dx
case
said
that
the
true
market
price
is
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
the
problem
with
the
natural
gas
industry
is
that
pipelines
have
traditionally
been
permitted
to
pass
on
their
purchased
gas
costs
in
the
form
of
increased
rates
and
as
a
consequence
there
has
been
no
incentive
for
the
pipeline
to
bargain
the
prices
down.
well,
the
purpose
of
the
commission’s
order
among
other
things
is
to
give
some
sense
of
reality
to
the
market
here
and
make
it
more
of
a
genuine
market.
so
to
that
extent
we
have
--
we
contemplate
--
the
commission
contemplates
something
approaching,
a
true
market
price
which
would
be
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
and
i
might
add
also
that
this
court
in
permian
made
it
quite
plain
that
it
was
permissible
for
the
commission
to
take
into
account
market
factors
in
determining
the
just
and
reasonable
rates.
finally,
there
seems
to
be
a
suggestion
to
mr.
schiff’s
argument
that
the
standard
of
prudence
is
something
that
inheres
in
the
constitution.
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
that
the
commission
apply
a
prudent
standard.
the
constitutional
limit
is
one
of
confiscation,
that’s
all.
the
statutory
standard
is
what
matters
here
and
that
standard
is
just
and
reasonable
and
that
is
the
standard
that
the
commission
intends
to
apply
when
it
reviews
the
small
producers’
rates
at
the
pipeline
level.
