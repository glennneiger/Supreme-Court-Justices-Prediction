mr.
ben
f.
vaughan
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
eight
individuals,
small
producers,
none
of
whom
sell
more
than
2,000,000
mcf
of
gas
a
year
at
prices
ranging
from
14
to
24
cents.
the
point
which
is
central
to
this
case
and
apparently
concerns
this
court
the
most
is
the
risk
of
a
refund
obligation
existing
and
yet
not
being
paid
by
the
party
who
received
the
money.
that
certainly
is
the
crux
to
the
case.
what
then
is
the
risk
that
there
will
be
a
charge
by
a
small
producer
that
is
too
high
and
then
we
must
look
to
the
position
of
the
small
producer
--
mr.
ben
f.
vaughan
iii
it
--
your
honor,
it
maybe
brought
in
action
by
a
public
service
commission,
but
it
must
be
brought
in
the
forum
of
the
commission
and
must
be
brought
by
the
commission.
mr.
ben
f.
vaughan
iii
only
if
the
commission
determines
that
it
--
that
the
rate
that
was
charged
was
unjust
and
unreasonable,
your
honor.
mr.
ben
f.
vaughan
iii
not
at
all,
your
honor.
it's
within
the
commission’s
discretion
and
indeed
the
court,
this
court
denied
certiorari
in
the
case
called
prado
oil
company
in
which
the
commission
had
taken
equitable
factors
into
consideration
and
had
not
ordered
the
--
mr.
ben
f.
vaughan
iii
no,
your
honor
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
--
mr.
ben
f.
vaughan
iii
i
--
beg
your
pardon
your
honor,
please
finish
your
question,
i
--
mr.
ben
f.
vaughan
iii
yes.
it
did
--
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
court
was
worried
that
there
should
have
been
a
refund
obligation
and
it's
my
suggest
that
the
market
position
which
is
occupied
by
the
small
producers
will
produce
a
rate
which
the
commission
could
reasonably
conclude
would
be
a
refund
for,
that
the
market
price
should
be
the
refund
for,
where
it
is
reviewed
continuously
by
the
commission
albeit
perspectively.
that
the
incentive
granting
by
permitting
the
small
producer
to
receive
his
market
price
will
enhance
exploratory
effort
of
the
explore
--
of
the
small
producer
and
at
least
it
should
--
could
show
--
so
be
determined
by
the
commission
that
this
enhancement
would
transpire.
the
small
producer
does
not
have
either
historically
or
under
the
terms
of
order
428,
the
power
to
charge
whatever
price
he
likes.
historically,
the
small
producer
leases
land
or
sub-leases
land,
it's
called
farming
out
from
the
large
producer.
he
is
all
set
by
the
large
producer.
he
takes
the
land
and
does
the
drilling
and
earns
a
small
portion
of
the
acreage
that
the
large
producer
has.
if
he’s
successful
in
his
exploratory
wells,
the
large
producer
then
drills
developmental
wells
offsetting
him.
a
pipeline
comes
to
the
large
producer
who
is
directly
regulated
and
says,
“will
you
sell
me
your
gas?”
the
large
producer
said,
“yes,”
he
comes
to
the
small
producer
with
the
same
rate.
he
says,
“will
you
sell
me
your
gas?”
small
producer
says,
“no.”
pipeline
says,
“fine,
will
just
drain
you
by
buying
it
from
the
large
producer.”
he
has
no
market
if
he
doesn’t
agree.
secondly,
--
mr.
ben
f.
vaughan
iii
why
does
all
this
transpire?
well,
your
honor
it
--
for
one,
i
think
two
basic
reasons.
one
is
that
the
large
producers
tend
to
hunt
for
big
game
and
another
phenomenon,
that
transpires
in
the
industry
is
that
the
geophysical
techniques,
the
science
of
oil
exploration
does
not
yield
and
has
not
yielded
an
increased
success
ratio
in
the
--
over
the
years.
they’re
finding
the
same
number
of
wells
per
--
same
number
of
productive
wells
per
wells
drill
now
that
they
were
in
the
20’s
and
the
large
producer
says,
“small
producer,
you
go
out
and
drill.
we’ll
invest
our
capital
in
large
leased
box,
so
that
if
you
do
find
something
then
we
can
spend
all
our
money
in
development.”
the
second
class
of
gas
of
course
is
your
flowing
gas
and
they
--
the
contract
prices
now
prevail
for
flowing
gas
for
small
producers,
but
if
we
look
at
how
much
of
the
contract
prices
will
exceed,
the
directly
regulated
just
in
area
rates,
we
will
see
that
there
is
only
about
25%
of
the
contract
provisions
which
permit
the
gas,
the
small
producers,
indeed
the
gas
of
all
producers,
according
to
the
study,
gas
of
all
producers
to
exceed
the
just
and
reasonable
area
rate
and
it
is
this
increment,
this
25%
increment
of
the
small
producer
--
production
or
approximately
3%
of
the
total
gas
upon
which
the
small
producer
must
rely
to
finance
his
exploratory
efforts.
i
thank
the
court.
