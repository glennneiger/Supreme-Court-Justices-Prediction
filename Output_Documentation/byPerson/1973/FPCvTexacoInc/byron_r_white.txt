justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
order
isn’t
all
that
fair,
is
it?
it
takes
a
little
bit
of
argument
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
as
the
court
of

couldn’t
read
it
like
as
you
suggested,
mr.

justice
byron
r.
white
the
court

didn’t
read
it
like
--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
does
that
the
commission
objects
to
putting
it
in
another
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
it’s
a
--
i
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
might
come
up
with
different
result
if
you
said
in
the
--
plainly
in
your
order,
what
you
claim
the
order
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
certainly
doesn’t
though
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
i
--
this
is
one
way
of
saying
what
it
means,
that
you’re
now
saying
this
is
precisely
what
it
means
and
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so
now
you’re
sending
it
back,
now
that
you’ve
said
what
it
means.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
--
the
commission
doesn’t
contend
that
the
order
would
permit
refunds,
you
--
your
regulation
is
going
to
be
wholly
prospective,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
maybe
the
pipelines
are
on
the
hook,
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
producer,
if
you
determine
that
producers
have
been
charging
unreasonable
rates
to
the
pipeline
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
you’ve
committed
yourself
apparently
not
to
order
any
refund?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
rate
is
determined
to
be
unreasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
--
what
about
under
the
federal
power
act,
is
there
any
independent
cause
of
action
for
a
refund
by
a
consumer
or
a
pipeline?
justice
byron
r.
white
natural
gas
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
was,
it
wouldn’t
do
you
much
good
to
say
that
we’re
not
going
to
order
any
refunds?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

for
managed

there’s
an
independent
you
can
sue
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
the
refund
obligation
never
comes
from
the
part
imposed
by
the

justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
--
what's
the
source
of
the
obligation
to
refund,
only
if
commission
determines
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
that

does
it
automatically
follow
that
there
is
a

that
there's
a
refund
obligation
if
the
rate
is
determined
to
be
unjust
and
unreasonable?
justice
byron

white
but
there's
never
going
to
be
any
--
under
this
order
there's
never
going
to
be
any
refund
obligation
then?
justice
byron

white
i
mean
there’s
nothing
of
--
justice
byron

white
i
would
suppose
you
could
restate
that
the
worry
is
being
that
maybe
there
ought

obligation,
is
that
what
you’re
suggesting?
justice

white
oh!
justice
byron

white
what
would
you
--
what
argument
would
you
make
if
the

actually
said
what
the

says
it
said?
let’s
assume
the
order

in

precisely
what
the

claims
it
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron

but
they
say,
they

they
say
they
are
regulating

white
--
in
this

and
that
when

when

if
they
find
a

charging
unreasonable

they
will
correct
it.
justice
byron

white
well,
that’s
what
they

they
say
that
--
justice

yes.
they
say
that.
justice
byron

let’s
say
that
they

it
does
have
two
other
the
factors
they
take
it
in

that’s
all
they
say.
justice
byron

white
well,
i
want
to

i
want
to
just
to
accept
the

their

as
they

now
as

except
the
fact
that
the

means
what
they

it
means
now.
justice

they
say
that,
they
say
that

that
they
do
take
into

--
they
--
that
they
plan
to
take
into

a
lot
more
than
just
those
two
factors,
that’s
what
they
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i’ll
accept
that
for
the

justice

now,
what's
illegal
about
their
proceeding
along
this

justice

it
may
be
impossible,
but
is
it
illegal
under

justice

white
why
is
it?
justice
byron

white
what
would
they
be
doing
now?
justice
byron

white
and
there
might
be
some
problems
with
the

getting
together,
it
might
be?
justice
byron

white
well,
why
--
justice
byron

was
the
court

stayed?
justice
byron

but
so
the

how
can
they
be

let's

if
their

no,

the

justice

now,
is

are
you

72-1490
and
72-1491
are
here
from
the
court
of

for

set
aside
an
order
of

and
who
are
the
customers
of
the

the

thought
that

had
abandoned
the
statutory
standard
for
the
review
of

namely
the
just-and-reasonable
standard
prescribed
by

therefore,
it

this

whatsoever
to

standard
for
judging
of
the
acceptability
of
gas
rates.
we
have
looked
at
that
order
with
some
care,
however,
and
it
is
ambiguous
to
say
the
least,
and
does
not
measure
up
to
what
is
normally
required
for
an
acceptable
order
of
the
regulatory
commission.
we
think
the
commission
should
reconsider
that
order
and
accordingly,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of

and
direct
that
the

be
remanded

further

before

standard
for
judging
of
the
acceptability
of
gas
rates.
we
have
looked
at
that
order
with
some
care,
however,
and
it
is
ambiguous
to
say
the
least,
and
does
not
measure
up
to
what
is
normally
required
for
an
acceptable
order
of
the
regulatory
commission.
we
think
the
commission
should
reconsider
that
order
and
accordingly,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
direct
that
the
case
be
remanded
for
further
proceedings
before
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
justice
stewart
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
