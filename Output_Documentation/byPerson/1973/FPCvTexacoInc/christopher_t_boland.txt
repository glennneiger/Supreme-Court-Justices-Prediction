mr.
christopher
t.
boland
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
--
i’m
representing
the
interstate
natural
gas
pipeline
association
of
america
which
includes
in
its
membership
virtually
all
the
major
pipelines
in
the
united
states.
i’m
also
arguing
for
the
major
producers
in
this
case.
mr.
schiff
who
is
the
general
counsel
in
new
york
public
service
commission
will
follow
me.
we
have
a
rather
unusual
situation
here
and
this
maybe
a
first,
a
first
time
in
my
memory
that
the
three
segments
of
the
industry
are
unified.
we
find
the
pipelines,
we
find
the
major
producers,
we
find
the
consumers
represented
by
mr.
schiff,
all
unified
in
their
attack
against
order
428
issued
by
the
commission.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
one
point
very
clear
in
the
--
at
the
outset.
no
one
of
us
is
opposed
to
giving
the
small
producer
a
higher
rate.
we
think
that
based
upon
a
proper
record
that
the
federal
power
commission
may
well
justify
a
higher
rate
which
is
just
unreasonable
for
the
small
producer
under
the
circumstances,
but
such
is
not
the
case
here.
there
is
no
record
in
this
case.
there
are
few
comments
in
the
transcript
of
an
informal
conference
and
that’s
all
we
have.
now,
our
friends
here
in
the
government
have
told
us
in
their
reply
brief
that
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
fpc
can
exempt
the
small
producer
from
the
natural
gas
act
and
they
say
that
the
commission
hasn’t
claimed
this
authority
and
they
say
they
don’t
argue
that
the
statute
permits
it
and
they
say
that
the
contention
of
the
act
requires
all
producer
rates
to
be
just
and
reasonable
is
beside
the
point.
now,
the
real
issue
as
we
see
it
is
the
exemption
of
the
small
producer
and
the
how
--
no
matter
how
you
twist
or
turn
it,
that
is
exactly
what
the
commission
did
in
order
428
and
in
its
notice,
the
original
notice
issued
in
the
rulemaking
proceeding,
it
was
frankly
captioned,
“exemption
of
small
producers
in
regulation”
at
joint
appendix
1.
the
notice
also
stated
that
the
small
producers
would
be
exempt
from
all
the
provisions
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
regulations
other
than
an
annual
report
on
volumes
and
sale
and
this
in
the
notice.
so
let's
go
with
the
order
and
in
the
order,
the
commission
told
the
small
producers,
“we
seek
to
assure
the
small
producers
that
when
he
enters
into
a
new
contract
for
the
interstate
sale
of
gas,
the
provisions
of
his
contract
will
not,
will
not
be
subject
to
change”
joint
appendix
137.
now
we
think
that
these,
taken
together,
clearly
indicate
that
the
commission
contemplated
an
exemption
and
indeed
the
court
of
appeals
wasn’t
mislead
on
this
point.
but
in
the
exemption,
the
counterpart
of
the
exemption
in
order
to
give
some
camouflage
to
some
sort
of
regulation,
what
they
did
was
to
shift
the
regulatory
responsibility
from
the
federal
power
commission
to
the
pipelines
and
large
producers.
and
this
at
a
time
when
the
pressures
are
on
us
as
purchasers
to
pay
the
market
price,
they
are
asking
us
to
substitute
our
regulation
for
theirs
under
the
natural
gas
act.
as
mentioned
the
two
standards
in
428
were
given
as
the
highest
contract
price
by
large
producers
or
the
prevailing
market
price.
now,
we
had
some
problems
in
the
vagueness
of
these
two
terms,
but
much
less
than
we
have
as
a
result
of
the
reply
brief
filed
by
our
friends
here
and
i’ll
get
to
that
a
little
later.
now,
as
to
the
large
producers,
they
had
a
third
standard
and
they
had
have
a
market
differential
that
was
prevailing
in
the
area,
but
the
purpose
of
order
428
was
absolutely
obvious.
it
was
to
give
the
small
producers
a
price
in
excess
of
the
just
and
reasonable
price.
otherwise
there
was
absolutely
no
purpose
in
the
commission
issuing
order
428.
it’s
clear
that
this
is
what
they
had
in
mind.
and
in
so
doing,
and
giving
these
standards,
they
gave
the
pipelines
what
we
thought
was
somewhat
of
an
assurance.
they
said,
“the
standards,
these
two
standards,
the
standards
also
provide
pipelines
with
a
more
concrete
guide
for
their
future
actions
than
what
exists
in
the
absence
thereof.”
simply
put
the
commission
wanted
the
pipelines
to
know
in
advance
the
boundaries
within
which
they
could
freely
contract
the
small
producers.
as
i’ve
indicated,
we
think
that
that
is
--
the
order
428
adds
up
to
complete
exemption
for
the
small
producers.
we
think
that
it’s
in
absolute
contravention
of
the
clear
and
unequivocal
terms
in
the
natural
gas
act
and
the
natural
gas
act
says,
section
4
says,
“all
rates
shall
be
just
and
reasonable
and
any
rate
that
is
not
just
and
reasonable
is
hereby
declared
to
be
unlawful.”
section
4
(d)
says,
“no
natural
gas
company,
and
there
is
no
argument
that
a
sale
by
a
small
producer
here
involved
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale
is
a
natural
gas
company
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.”
section
4
(b)
says,
“no
natural
gas
company
shall
make
any
claim,
undue
preference
or
maintain
any
unreasonable
difference
in
rates.”
section
4(c)
says,
“every
natural
gas
company
shall
file
with
the
commission,
schedule
showing
all
rates
for
any
transportation
and
sale.
section
5
is
likewise
clear.
it
says,
“whenever
the
commission
shall
find
any
rate
charged
by
any
natural
gas
company
is
unjust,
the
commission
shall
fix
the
rate
as
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.”
now,
the
commission
in
order
428,
and
that’s
what
we’re
dealing
with
here
relied
for
its
exemption,
relied
on
the
fact
that
sections
4,
5,
and
7
which
is
a
certificate
provision,
are
not
mandatory,
but
discretionary.
this
is
what
they
said
in
the
order.
they’re
not
arguing
that
now
before
this
court,
but
this
is
what
they
said
in
the
order,
that
it’s
not
mandatory
and
they’ve
cited
mr.
justice
clark’s
comments
in
fpc
v.
hunt
and
also
the
permian
case.
now,
mr.
justice
clark’s
statement
was
pure
dictum.
he
was
talking
about
nlrb
act
which
allowed
the
natural
labor
relations
board
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
would
exempt
certain
types
of
activities.
there’s
no
such
similar
provisions
than
the
natural
gas
act
and
in
the
permian
case,
the
permian
case
has
no
precedent
for
what
the
commission
purported
to
do
in
428.
in
the
permian
case,
the
commission
had
taken
small
producers,
classified
them
separately,
issued
a
blanket
certificate
and
said,
“as
long
as
you
do
not
exceed
the
10
billion
cubic
feet
a
year,
you
don’t
need
any
further
certificate
authorization
for
your
sales
in
interstate
commerce
as
long
as
and
only
under
the
condition
that
your
rate
to
the
pipeline
purchaser
does
not
exceed
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
and
that’s
precisely
what
the
permian
case
says
were
and
has
no
basis
at
all
for
the
commission’s
exemption.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
yes.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
are
you
saying
what
they
claim
here?
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
before
the
court?
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
i
would
say
that
the
act
precludes
it,
absolutely
precludes
it.
there
is
no
way
--
what
they
initially
relied
on
were
these
two
citations
to
the
section
16.
and
section
16,
is
merely
a
catchall
provision
on
many
statutes
but
gives
the
power
to
issue
regulations
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
to
classify
certain
acts
to
carry
out
the
purpose
of
the
act.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
they
say
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
they
say
they’re
regulating
indirectly
through
the
pipeline.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
through
the
pipeline
rates?
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
well,
they
say
that.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
and
they
say
that
the
standards
now,
that
the
market
standards
are
the
just
and
reasonable
standards.
they’re
not
claiming
that
they’re
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
well,
the
--
yes.
but
going
back
to
and
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
i
--
you
mean
that
the
all
other
relevant
factors
really
gave
them
the
power
to
take
into
consider
all
--
raising
all
the
things
they’re
now
talking
about.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
yes,
they
do.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
alright.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
i
think
the
standard
is
an
impossible
one
to
--
for
the
pipelines
to
live
by.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
yes.
i
think
that’s
illegal.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
i
think
in
all
the
decisions,
just
and
reasonable
rate
does
not
mean
the
market
price.
now,
that
maybe
reasonable
or
prudence,
in
our
opinion,
there's
this
vast
difference
in
regulatory
statutes
and
also
the
decisions
of
all
the
courts
between
a
prudent
act
of
a
pipeline,
let's
say
in
going
out
and
buying
that
any
--
at
a
price
not
in
excess
to
the
market,
but
that
may
not
be
the
just
and
reasonable
price
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
well,
they
did,
mr.
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
they
don’t
know,
that’s
right.
but
what
they
do
substituted
for
it
is,
they
say
that
the
sophisticated
pipeline
purchaser
can
at
the
time
he’s
negotiating
a
contract
that
he
can
ask
the
producer
for
his
costs.
now
the
federal
power
commission
has
been
after
producer
cost
for
20
years
and
hasn’t
been
successful
yet.
but
notwithstanding
this,
they
have
suggested
that
one
of
the
things
that
we
do
is
ask
the
producer
for
his
cost.
now,
that’s
going
to
be
one
of
the
guides
that
they
would
take
into
consideration.
at
the
time
they
determined
whether
we
have
to
refund
or
whether
we
don’t.
they’ve
also
said,
“okay,
the
pipelines
need
for
the
gas,”
the
availability
of
other
gas
supplies,
the
amount
of
gas
dedicated
under
contracts,
the
rates
of
other
small
producers
and
recent
sales
and
what?
and
any
other
consideration
that
may
suggest
the
reasonableness
of
the
rate.
what
kind
of
a
standard
is
that?
what
kind
of
a
guideline
is
that?
and
what
the
commission
has
done
here,
here
we
are
in
a
sellers’
market,
there
is
no
question
that
it’s
a
sellers’
market.
there
is
a
terrific
demand
for
gas,
unmet
and
the
commission
is
shifting
the
rate
responsibility,
the
regulatory
responsibility
to
the
pipeline
purchaser
in
a
sellers’
market
and
expects
us
to
regulate
the
rates
so
that
it
will
come
up
with
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
now,
we
say
that
that’s
impossible
task
and
one
that’s
absolutely
contrary
to
clear
language
of
the
natural
gas
act.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
[laughter]
yes,
i
think
there
could
be
problems
in
pipelines
getting
together
and
then
the
producers
are
well
aware
of
that.
but
in
any
event,
i’ve
covered
the
permian,
what
--
what's
happened
here
is,
we’ve
seen
a
patchwork
post
hoc
by
the
federal
power
commission
all
the
way
through
this.
the
first
thing
that
happened
was
the
notice.
on
the
notice
there
was
clear
language
that
the
pipelines
would
be
able
to
pickup
any
increase
or
any
price
paid.
i
use
the
word
tracking,
that’s
what
tracking
means
in
our
order
before
the
commission.
in
the
--
in
the
order
that
came
out,
they
said,
“no,
we’re
going
to
put
indirect
regulation.
we’re
going
to
hold
you
responsible.”
and
at
this
point
there
was
no
change
in
the
producer
price
at
all,
prospective
or
otherwise,
nothing.
the
first
time
we
came
across
a
reduction
in
producer
price
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
briefs
filed
by
the
government,
in
their
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
at
that
time
they
were
still
adhering
to
the
fact
that
the
provisions
of
the
natural
gas
act
were
discretionary
and
that
they
were
recognizing
in
fact
that
they
were
exempting
the
small
producer,
but
within
the
purview
of
their
powers
under
section
16
of
the
natural
gas
act.
but
now,
before
you,
they’ve
abandoned
all
that
and
they
now
say,
“that’s
all
beside
the
point,
that’s
all
beside
the
point.”
when
we’ve
got
a
new
ball
game
here
and
what
we’re
saying
to
this
court
is
that
the
rate
--
ultimately
will
be
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
were
abandoning
the
standards
at
all.
and
the
indirect
regulation
is
nothing
more
than
sunray
dx.
sunray
dx
had
to
do
with
the
need
for
gas,
not
rates,
which
is
the
heart
of
the
act
as
found
by
this
court
in
the
famous
hope
case.
the
heart
of
the
regulatory
scheme
is
the
rate
section.
but
what
they’re
talking
about
is
the
certificate
case,
where
the
need
for
the
gas,
do
you
determine
that
in
the
pipeline
case
or
do
you
determine
it
in
the
producer
case.
i
think
that’s
a
totally
different
case
than
the
one
we
have
here
as
to
the
direct
rate
responsibility
being
shifted
to
the
pipelines
when
the
clear
responsibility
is
vested
in
the
federal
power
commission.
we
think
all
of
this
is
contrary
to
the
rule
of
the
chenery
case.
we
don’t
think
that
they
come
and
patch
their
order
up.
we
think
that
this
court
will
decide
this
on
the
basis
of
428.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
i’m
glad
you
mentioned
that
mr.
chief
justice
because
this
is
not
an
experiment
and
they
keep
talking
about
this
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
raised
the
question
well
wasn’t
this
started
in
1970,
it
was.
the
notice
issued
was
in
--
issued
on
july
23rd,
1970
and
the
order
428
was
issued
on
march
18th,
1971.
that’s
all
--
that’s
one
month’s
short
of
three
years.
there
wasn’t
anything
experimental
in
the
act,
i
mean
in
the
order.
the
commission
didn’t
purport
as
my
recollection
to
do
it
on
an
experimental
basis,
but
even
if
they
had,
they’ve
had
three
years.
three
years
to
develop
a
record
a
--
there
is
no
record
in
this
case,
to
support
what
they’ve
done.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
no.
this
has
been
in
effect.
now,
it
could
be
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
issued
its
decision
that
might
have
had
a
modifying
effect
on
action,
but
notwithstanding
that
has
never
been
stayed.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
the
order
is
in
effect.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
no.
and
your
honor
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
oh!
yes.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
right.
and
it’s
interesting
to
note.
it’s
interesting
to
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
the
court
of
appeals
set
to
decide,
that’s
right.
but
the
commission
is
still
operating
under
this
and
just
last
month,
all
that
was
in
anticipation
of
this
argument
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
well,
the
pipelines
are
still
entering
into
contracts
and
we
have
one
just
in
january,
trunkline,
pipeline
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
no.
no
your
honor.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
well,
as
far
as
i
know,
they
haven’t
done
anything
one
way
--
well,
they
haven’t
done
anything
to
indicate
that
they're
not
operating
under
this
thing
and
as
i
mentioned
on
july
31st
of
--
i
mean
january
31st,
almost
in
anticipation
of
this
oral
argument,
the
commission
for
the
first
time
issued
an
order
against
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
no.
no
sir.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
no,
your
honor.
but
on
january
31st,
just
last
month,
for
the
first
time,
they
issued
an
order
against
trunkline
--
pipeline
company
where
they
filed
a
tracking
increase
and
they
suspended
it
because
the
price
being
paid
to
a
small
producer
maybe
unreasonably
excessive.
as
the
first
monitoring
that
we’ve
seen
in
three
years
of
this
great
monitoring,
my
friend,
mr.
evans
has
indicated,
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
--
i’m
representing
the
interstate
natural
gas
pipeline
association
of
america
which
includes
in
its
membership
virtually
all
the
major
pipelines
in
the
united
states.
i’m
also
arguing
for
the
major
producers
in
this
case.
mr.
schiff
who
is
the
general
counsel
in
new
york
public
service
commission
will
follow
me.
we
have
a
rather
unusual
situation
here
and
this
maybe
a
first,
a
first
time
in
my
memory
that
the
three
segments
of
the
industry
are
unified.
we
find
the
pipelines,
we
find
the
major
producers,
we
find
the
consumers
represented
by
mr.
schiff,
all
unified
in
their
attack
against
order
428
issued
by
the
commission.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
one
point
very
clear
in
the
--
at
the
outset.
no
one
of
us
is
opposed
to
giving
the
small
producer
a
higher
rate.
we
think
that
based
upon
a
proper
record
that
the
federal
power
commission
may
well
justify
a
higher
rate
which
is
just
unreasonable
for
the
small
producer
under
the
circumstances,
but
such
is
not
the
case
here.
there
is
no
record
in
this
case.
there
are
few
comments
in
the
transcript
of
an
informal
conference
and
that’s
all
we
have.
now,
our
friends
here
in
the
government
have
told
us
in
their
reply
brief
that
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
fpc
can
exempt
the
small
producer
from
the
natural
gas
act
and
they
say
that
the
commission
hasn’t
claimed
this
authority
and
they
say
they
don’t
argue
that
the
statute
permits
it
and
they
say
that
the
contention
of
the
act
requires
all
producer
rates
to
be
just
and
reasonable
is
beside
the
point.
now,
the
real
issue
as
we
see
it
is
the
exemption
of
the
small
producer
and
the
how
--
no
matter
how
you
twist
or
turn
it,
that
is
exactly
what
the
commission
did
in
order
428
and
in
its
notice,
the
original
notice
issued
in
the
rulemaking
proceeding,
it
was
frankly
captioned,
“exemption
of
small
producers
in
regulation”
at
joint
appendix
1.
the
notice
also
stated
that
the
small
producers
would
be
exempt
from
all
the
provisions
of
the
natural
gas
act
and
regulations
other
than
an
annual
report
on
volumes
and
sale
and
this
in
the
notice.
so
let's
go
with
the
order
and
in
the
order,
the
commission
told
the
small
producers,
“we
seek
to
assure
the
small
producers
that
when
he
enters
into
a
new
contract
for
the
interstate
sale
of
gas,
the
provisions
of
his
contract
will
not,
will
not
be
subject
to
change”
joint
appendix
137.
now
we
think
that
these,
taken
together,
clearly
indicate
that
the
commission
contemplated
an
exemption
and
indeed
the
court
of
appeals
wasn’t
mislead
on
this
point.
but
in
the
exemption,
the
counterpart
of
the
exemption
in
order
to
give
some
camouflage
to
some
sort
of
regulation,
what
they
did
was
to
shift
the
regulatory
responsibility
from
the
federal
power
commission
to
the
pipelines
and
large
producers.
and
this
at
a
time
when
the
pressures
are
on
us
as
purchasers
to
pay
the
market
price,
they
are
asking
us
to
substitute
our
regulation
for
theirs
under
the
natural
gas
act.
as
mentioned
the
two
standards
in
428
were
given
as
the
highest
contract
price
by
large
producers
or
the
prevailing
market
price.
now,
we
had
some
problems
in
the
vagueness
of
these
two
terms,
but
much
less
than
we
have
as
a
result
of
the
reply
brief
filed
by
our
friends
here
and
i’ll
get
to
that
a
little
later.
now,
as
to
the
large
producers,
they
had
a
third
standard
and
they
had
have
a
market
differential
that
was
prevailing
in
the
area,
but
the
purpose
of
order
428
was
absolutely
obvious.
it
was
to
give
the
small
producers
a
price
in
excess
of
the
just
and
reasonable
price.
otherwise
there
was
absolutely
no
purpose
in
the
commission
issuing
order
428.
it’s
clear
that
this
is
what
they
had
in
mind.
and
in
so
doing,
and
giving
these
standards,
they
gave
the
pipelines
what
we
thought
was
somewhat
of
an
assurance.
they
said,
“the
standards,
these
two
standards,
the
standards
also
provide
pipelines
with
a
more
concrete
guide
for
their
future
actions
than
what
exists
in
the
absence
thereof.”
simply
put
the
commission
wanted
the
pipelines
to
know
in
advance
the
boundaries
within
which
they
could
freely
contract
the
small
producers.
as
i’ve
indicated,
we
think
that
that
is
--
the
order
428
adds
up
to
complete
exemption
for
the
small
producers.
we
think
that
it’s
in
absolute
contravention
of
the
clear
and
unequivocal
terms
in
the
natural
gas
act
and
the
natural
gas
act
says,
section
4
says,
“all
rates
shall
be
just
and
reasonable
and
any
rate
that
is
not
just
and
reasonable
is
hereby
declared
to
be
unlawful.”
section
4
(d)
says,
“no
natural
gas
company,
and
there
is
no
argument
that
a
sale
by
a
small
producer
here
involved
in
interstate
commerce
for
resale
is
a
natural
gas
company
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.”
section
4
(b)
says,
“no
natural
gas
company
shall
make
any
claim,
undue
preference
or
maintain
any
unreasonable
difference
in
rates.”
section
4(c)
says,
“every
natural
gas
company
shall
file
with
the
commission,
schedule
showing
all
rates
for
any
transportation
and
sale.
section
5
is
likewise
clear.
it
says,
“whenever
the
commission
shall
find
any
rate
charged
by
any
natural
gas
company
is
unjust,
the
commission
shall
fix
the
rate
as
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.”
now,
the
commission
in
order
428,
and
that’s
what
we’re
dealing
with
here
relied
for
its
exemption,
relied
on
the
fact
that
sections
4,
5,
and
7
which
is
a
certificate
provision,
are
not
mandatory,
but
discretionary.
this
is
what
they
said
in
the
order.
they’re
not
arguing
that
now
before
this
court,
but
this
is
what
they
said
in
the
order,
that
it’s
not
mandatory
and
they’ve
cited
mr.
justice
clark’s
comments
in
fpc
v.
hunt
and
also
the
permian
case.
now,
mr.
justice
clark’s
statement
was
pure
dictum.
he
was
talking
about
nlrb
act
which
allowed
the
natural
labor
relations
board
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
would
exempt
certain
types
of
activities.
there’s
no
such
similar
provisions
than
the
natural
gas
act
and
in
the
permian
case,
the
permian
case
has
no
precedent
for
what
the
commission
purported
to
do
in
428.
in
the
permian
case,
the
commission
had
taken
small
producers,
classified
them
separately,
issued
a
blanket
certificate
and
said,
“as
long
as
you
do
not
exceed
the
10
billion
cubic
feet
a
year,
you
don’t
need
any
further
certificate
authorization
for
your
sales
in
interstate
commerce
as
long
as
and
only
under
the
condition
that
your
rate
to
the
pipeline
purchaser
does
not
exceed
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
and
that’s
precisely
what
the
permian
case
says
were
and
has
no
basis
at
all
for
the
commission’s
exemption.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
yes.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
are
you
saying
what
they
claim
here?
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
before
the
court?
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
i
would
say
that
the
act
precludes
it,
absolutely
precludes
it.
there
is
no
way
--
what
they
initially
relied
on
were
these
two
citations
to
the
section
16.
and
section
16,
is
merely
a
catchall
provision
on
many
statutes
but
gives
the
power
to
issue
regulations
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
to
classify
certain
acts
to
carry
out
the
purpose
of
the
act.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
they
say
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
they
say
they’re
regulating
indirectly
through
the
pipeline.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
through
the
pipeline
rates?
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
well,
they
say
that.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
and
they
say
that
the
standards
now,
that
the
market
standards
are
the
just
and
reasonable
standards.
they’re
not
claiming
that
they’re
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
well,
the
--
yes.
but
going
back
to
and
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
i
--
you
mean
that
the
all
other
relevant
factors
really
gave
them
the
power
to
take
into
consider
all
--
raising
all
the
things
they’re
now
talking
about.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
yes,
they
do.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
alright.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
i
think
the
standard
is
an
impossible
one
to
--
for
the
pipelines
to
live
by.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
yes.
i
think
that’s
illegal.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
i
think
in
all
the
decisions,
just
and
reasonable
rate
does
not
mean
the
market
price.
now,
that
maybe
reasonable
or
prudence,
in
our
opinion,
there's
this
vast
difference
in
regulatory
statutes
and
also
the
decisions
of
all
the
courts
between
a
prudent
act
of
a
pipeline,
let's
say
in
going
out
and
buying
that
any
--
at
a
price
not
in
excess
to
the
market,
but
that
may
not
be
the
just
and
reasonable
price
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
well,
they
did,
mr.
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
they
don’t
know,
that’s
right.
but
what
they
do
substituted
for
it
is,
they
say
that
the
sophisticated
pipeline
purchaser
can
at
the
time
he’s
negotiating
a
contract
that
he
can
ask
the
producer
for
his
costs.
now
the
federal
power
commission
has
been
after
producer
cost
for
20
years
and
hasn’t
been
successful
yet.
but
notwithstanding
this,
they
have
suggested
that
one
of
the
things
that
we
do
is
ask
the
producer
for
his
cost.
now,
that’s
going
to
be
one
of
the
guides
that
they
would
take
into
consideration.
at
the
time
they
determined
whether
we
have
to
refund
or
whether
we
don’t.
they’ve
also
said,
“okay,
the
pipelines
need
for
the
gas,”
the
availability
of
other
gas
supplies,
the
amount
of
gas
dedicated
under
contracts,
the
rates
of
other
small
producers
and
recent
sales
and
what?
and
any
other
consideration
that
may
suggest
the
reasonableness
of
the
rate.
what
kind
of
a
standard
is
that?
what
kind
of
a
guideline
is
that?
and
what
the
commission
has
done
here,
here
we
are
in
a
sellers’
market,
there
is
no
question
that
it’s
a
sellers’
market.
there
is
a
terrific
demand
for
gas,
unmet
and
the
commission
is
shifting
the
rate
responsibility,
the
regulatory
responsibility
to
the
pipeline
purchaser
in
a
sellers’
market
and
expects
us
to
regulate
the
rates
so
that
it
will
come
up
with
the
just
and
reasonable
rate.
now,
we
say
that
that’s
impossible
task
and
one
that’s
absolutely
contrary
to
clear
language
of
the
natural
gas
act.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
[laughter]
yes,
i
think
there
could
be
problems
in
pipelines
getting
together
and
then
the
producers
are
well
aware
of
that.
but
in
any
event,
i’ve
covered
the
permian,
what
--
what's
happened
here
is,
we’ve
seen
a
patchwork
post
hoc
by
the
federal
power
commission
all
the
way
through
this.
the
first
thing
that
happened
was
the
notice.
on
the
notice
there
was
clear
language
that
the
pipelines
would
be
able
to
pickup
any
increase
or
any
price
paid.
i
use
the
word
tracking,
that’s
what
tracking
means
in
our
order
before
the
commission.
in
the
--
in
the
order
that
came
out,
they
said,
“no,
we’re
going
to
put
indirect
regulation.
we’re
going
to
hold
you
responsible.”
and
at
this
point
there
was
no
change
in
the
producer
price
at
all,
prospective
or
otherwise,
nothing.
the
first
time
we
came
across
a
reduction
in
producer
price
was
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
briefs
filed
by
the
government,
in
their
briefs
in
the
court
of
appeals.
but
at
that
time
they
were
still
adhering
to
the
fact
that
the
provisions
of
the
natural
gas
act
were
discretionary
and
that
they
were
recognizing
in
fact
that
they
were
exempting
the
small
producer,
but
within
the
purview
of
their
powers
under
section
16
of
the
natural
gas
act.
but
now,
before
you,
they’ve
abandoned
all
that
and
they
now
say,
“that’s
all
beside
the
point,
that’s
all
beside
the
point.”
when
we’ve
got
a
new
ball
game
here
and
what
we’re
saying
to
this
court
is
that
the
rate
--
ultimately
will
be
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
were
abandoning
the
standards
at
all.
and
the
indirect
regulation
is
nothing
more
than
sunray
dx.
sunray
dx
had
to
do
with
the
need
for
gas,
not
rates,
which
is
the
heart
of
the
act
as
found
by
this
court
in
the
famous
hope
case.
the
heart
of
the
regulatory
scheme
is
the
rate
section.
but
what
they’re
talking
about
is
the
certificate
case,
where
the
need
for
the
gas,
do
you
determine
that
in
the
pipeline
case
or
do
you
determine
it
in
the
producer
case.
i
think
that’s
a
totally
different
case
than
the
one
we
have
here
as
to
the
direct
rate
responsibility
being
shifted
to
the
pipelines
when
the
clear
responsibility
is
vested
in
the
federal
power
commission.
we
think
all
of
this
is
contrary
to
the
rule
of
the
chenery
case.
we
don’t
think
that
they
come
and
patch
their
order
up.
we
think
that
this
court
will
decide
this
on
the
basis
of
428.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
i’m
glad
you
mentioned
that
mr.
chief
justice
because
this
is
not
an
experiment
and
they
keep
talking
about
this
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
raised
the
question
well
wasn’t
this
started
in
1970,
it
was.
the
notice
issued
was
in
--
issued
on
july
23rd,
1970
and
the
order
428
was
issued
on
march
18th,
1971.
that’s
all
--
that’s
one
month’s
short
of
three
years.
there
wasn’t
anything
experimental
in
the
act,
i
mean
in
the
order.
the
commission
didn’t
purport
as
my
recollection
to
do
it
on
an
experimental
basis,
but
even
if
they
had,
they’ve
had
three
years.
three
years
to
develop
a
record
a
--
there
is
no
record
in
this
case,
to
support
what
they’ve
done.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
no.
this
has
been
in
effect.
now,
it
could
be
that
when
the
court
of
appeals
issued
its
decision
that
might
have
had
a
modifying
effect
on
action,
but
notwithstanding
that
has
never
been
stayed.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
the
order
is
in
effect.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
no.
and
your
honor
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
oh!
yes.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
right.
and
it’s
interesting
to
note.
it’s
interesting
to
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
the
court
of
appeals
set
to
decide,
that’s
right.
but
the
commission
is
still
operating
under
this
and
just
last
month,
all
that
was
in
anticipation
of
this
argument
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
well,
the
pipelines
are
still
entering
into
contracts
and
we
have
one
just
in
january,

mr.

t.
boland
well,
as
far
as
i
know,
they
haven’t
done
anything
one
way
--
well,
they
haven’t
done
anything
to
indicate
that
they're
not
operating
under
this
thing
and
as
i
mentioned
on
july
31st
of
--
i
mean
january
31st,
almost
in
anticipation
of
this
oral
argument,
the
commission
for
the
first
time
issued
an
order
against
--
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
no.
no
sir.
mr.
christopher
t.
boland
no,
your
honor.
but
on
january
31st,
just
last
month,
for
the
first
time,
they
issued
an
order
against
trunkline
--
pipeline
company
where
they
filed
a
tracking
increase
and
they
suspended
it
because
the
price
being
paid
to
a
small
producer
maybe
unreasonably
excessive.
as
the
first
monitoring
that
we’ve
seen
in
three
years
of
this
great
monitoring,
my
friend,
mr.
evans
has
indicated,
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
