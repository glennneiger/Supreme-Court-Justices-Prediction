justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
absence
of
mr.
justice
douglas,
i
announce
on
his
behalf
a
dissenting
opinion
that
he
has
filed.
in
pertinent
part,
the
dissent
reads
as
follows.
the
court
today
denies
the
district
court
authority
to
fashion
a
metropolitan
remedy.
yet
metropolitan
treatment
of
metropolitan
problems
is
commonplace.
if
this
were
a
sewage
problem
or
a
water
problem,
or
an
energy
problem,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
michigan
would
stay
well
within
federal
constitutional
method
--
bounds
if
she
sought
a
metropolitan
remedy.
in
the
richmond
school
case
affirmed
last
year
by
an
equally
divided
court.
we
had
a
case
involving
the
virginia
school
system
where
local
school
boards
had
"exclusive
jurisdiction"
of
the
problem,
not
"the
state
board
of
education."
michigan
is
very
different.
here
the
michigan
educational
system
is
unitary,
heading
up
in
the
legislature
under
which
is
the
state
board
of
education.
the
state
controls
the
boundaries
of
school
districts.
the
state
supervised
school
site
selection.
the
construction
was
done
through
municipal
bonds
approved
by
several
state
agencies.
education
in
michigan
is
a
state
project,
with
very
little
completely
local
control,
except
that
the
schools
are
financed
locally,
not
on
a
statewide
basis.
when
we
rule
against
the
metropolitan
area
remedy
we
take
a
step
backward
that
will
likely
put
the
problems
of
the
blacks
and
our
society
back
to
the
period
that
antedated
the
"separate
but
equal"
regime
of
plessy
and
ferguson.
the
reason
is
simple.
the
inner
core
of
detroit
is
now
rather
solidly
black
and
the
blacks
we
know,
in
many
instances
are
likely
to
be
poorer,
just
as
were
the
chicanos
in
san
antonio
v.
rodriguez,
decided
last
year.
under
the
rodriguez
decision,
the
poorer
school
districts
must
pay
their
own
way.
it
is
therefore
a
foregone
conclusion
that
we
have
now
given
the
states
a
formula
whereby
the
poor
must
pay
their
own
way.
today's
decision,
given
rodriguez,
means
that
there
is
no
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
though
the
schools
are
segregated
by
race
and
though
the
black
schools
are
not
only
"separate"
but
"inferior."
so
far
as
equal
protection
is
concerned,
we
are
now
in
a
dramatic
retreat
from
the
8-to-1
decision
in
1896
in
plessy
and
ferguson,
that
blacks
could
be
segregated
in
public
facilities,
provided
they
received
equal
treatment.
there
is
so
far
as
the
school
cases
go,
no
constitutional
difference
between
de
facto
and
de
jure
segregation.
each
school
board
performs
state
action
for
fourteenth
amendment
purposes
when
it
draws
the
lines
that
confine
it
to
a
given
area,
when
it
builds
schools
at
particular
sites,
or
when
it
allocates
students.
the
creation
of
the
school
districts
in
metropolitan
detroit
either
maintained
existing
segregation
or
caused
additional
segregation.
restrictive
covenants
maintained
by
state
action
or
inaction
build
black
ghettos.
it
is
state
action
when
public
funds
are
dispensed
by
housing
agencies
to
build
racial
ghettos.
where
a
community
is
racially
mixed
and
school
authorities
segregate
schools,
or
assign
black
teachers
to
black
schools
or
close
schools
in
fringe
areas
and
build
new
schools
in
black
areas
and
in
more
distant
white
areas,
the
state
creates
and
nurtures
a
segregated
school
system,
just
as
surely
as
did
those
states
involved
in
brown
v.
board
of
education,
when
they
maintained
dual
school
systems.
all
these
conditions
and
more
were
found
by
the
district
court
to
exist.
the
issue
is
not
whether
there
should
be
racial
balance,
but
whether
the
state's
use
of
various
devices
that
end
up
with
black
schools
and
white
schools
brought
the
equal
protection
clause
into
effect.
given
the
state's
control
over
the
educational
system
in
michigan,
the
fact
that
the
black
schools
are
in
one
district
and
the
white
schools
are
in
another
is
not
controlling,
either
constitutionally
or
equitably.
no
specific
plan
has
yet
been
adopted.
we
are
still
at
an
interlocutory
stage
of
a
long
drawn-out
judicial
effort
at
school
desegregation.
it
is
conceivable
that
ghettos
develop
on
their
own
without
any
hint
of
state
action,
but
since
michigan
by
one
device
or
another
has
over
the
years
created
black
school
districts
and
white
school
districts,
the
task
of
equity
is
to
provide
a
unitary
system
for
the
affected
area
whereas
here,
the
state
washes
its
hands
of
its
own
creations.
in
my
view,
concludes
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
court
of
appeals

has
responsibly
in
these
cases
and
we
should
affirm
