i
have
the
disposition
to
announce
for
the
court
in
number
73-434,
milliken
against
bradley,
along
with
73-435
and
436,
allen
park
public
schools
against
bradley
and
grosse
pointe
public
school
system
against
bradley.
the
respondents
in
these
cases
brought
this
class
action
alleging
that
the
detroit
public
school
system
was
racially
segregated
as
a
result
of
the
official
policies
and
the
actions
of
petitioner
state
and
city
officials.
they
sought
implementation
of
a
plan
to
eliminate
the
segregation
in
detroit
and
establish
a
unitary
nonracial
school
system
in
that
city.
the
district
court
concluded,
that
various
acts
by
the
petitioner,
the
detroit
school
board
of
education
had
created
and
perpetuated
school
segregation
in
detroit.
when
the
district
court
turns
the
question
of
an
appropriate
remedy
for
detroit
segregation
that
it
had
found,
it
proceeded
to
order
the
detroit
board
of
education
to
submit
plans
dealing
with
the
segregation
problems
found
to
exist
in
that
city
which
of
course
was
what
the
lawsuit
was
all
about.
at
the
same
time,
however,
the
state
defendants
were
directed
by
the
district
court
to
submit
desegregation
plans
that
would
include
the
three-county
metropolitan
area,
covering
a
total
of
1952
square
miles.
despite
the
fact
that
the
school
districts
of
these
three
counties
were
not
parties
to
the
action
and
despite
that
there
had
been
no
claim
up
to
that
time
made
by
anyone
that
these
outlying
counties
that
included
85
separate
school
districts
had
committed
have
committed
any
constitutional
violations
of
any
kind.
the
outlying
school
districts
through
them
allowed
to
intervene,
by
the
express
terms
of
the
order
of
the
district
court,
they
were
not
permitted
to
assert
any
claim
or
defense
on
issues
previously
decided
or
to
reopen
any
issue
previously
decided.
they
were
allowed
simply
to
advise
the
court
as
to
the
propriety
of
a
metropolitan
plan
and
to
submit
any
modifications
or
alternatives
to
such
plan.
without
taking
any
evidence
on
the
subject,
the
district
court
then
ruled
that
it
was
proper
to
consider
metropolitan
plans,
including
53
of
the
80
odd
outlying
school
districts.
and
within
a
few
days
after
that
the
judge
filed
his
decision,
holding
that
it
was
proper
for
the
court
to
consider
consider
metropolitan
plans
directed
towards
desegregation
of
the
detroit
public
schools
as
an
alternative
to
the
detroit
only
plans,
which
were
then
before
the
court.
the
district
court
then
issued
its
findings
and
conclusions
on
the
three
alternative
detroit-only
plans
submitted
by
the
city
school
boards
and
some
by
the
respondents
and
found
that
the
best
of
these
three,
as
the
court
viewed
one
to
be
the
best,
would
make
the
detroit
system
identifiably
negro,
thereby
and
i
used
the
terms
of
the
district
judge
now,
thereby
increasing
the
flight
of
whites
from
the
city
and
from
the
system.
from
this,
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
detroit
only
plan
would
not
accomplish
desegregation
within
the
corporate,
geographical
limits
of
the
city
of
detroit.
accordingly,
the
district
court
held
that
it
was
required
to
look
beyond
the
limits
of
the
detroit
school
district
for
solution
to
the
problem
as
it
saw
the
problem
and
here
i
use
his
words
again,
because
school
district
lines
are
simply
matters
of
political
convenience
and
may
not
be
used
to
deny
constitutional
rights.
the
district
court
then
issued
its
ruling
on
the
desegregation
area
and
the
related
findings
and
conclusions.
the
district
judge
acknowledged
at
the
outset
that
he
had
taken
no
evidence
with
respect
to
the
establishment
of
the
boundaries
of
the
85
school
districts
surrounding
or
at
least
near
detroit
itself.
nor
had
he
taken
any
evidence
on
the
issue
of
whether
these
outlying
school
districts
had
committed
any
acts
of
de
jure
segregation.
nevertheless,
the
district
court
then
carved
out
53
of
the
85
suburban
school
districts
plus
detroit
and
held
that
this
was
to
become
the
metropolitan
desegregation
area.
the
district
court
then
appointed
a
panel
to
prepare
and
submit
what
he
described
as
an
effective
desegregation
plan,
for
the
detroit
schools
that
would
include
the
entire
desegregation
area
with
the
total
of
53
school
districts.
the
court
ordered
the
detroit
board
of
education
to
purchase
or
otherwise
acquire
at
least
295
school
buses
for
the
purpose
of
providing
the
necessary
transportation
under
an
interim
plan
that
was
to
be
developed
immediately
or
partly
at
least
for
the
1972-1973
school
year.
the
costs
of
this
acquisition
of
these
295
or
more
buses
was
to
be
borne
by
the
state.
when
the
case
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
court
affirmed
in
part
and
held
that
the
that
the
record
supported
the
district
court's
findings
as
to
the
constitutional
violations
committed
by
the
detroit
board
and
the
state
officials.
that
therefore
the
district
court
was
authorized
and
permitted
to
take
the
effective
measures
to
desegregate
the
detroit
school
system
and
that
a
metropolitan
area's
plan
embracing
the
53
outlying
school
districts
was
the
only
feasible
solution
and
was
within
the
district
court's
equity
powers.
with
the
court
having
thus
decided
the
case
or
at
least
these
issues,
remanded
to
the
district
court
so
that
all
suburban
school
districts
that
might
be
affected
by
a
metropolitan
remedy
could
be
made
parties
to
the
lawsuit
and
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
as
to
the
scope
and
implementation
of
the
remedy.
it
vacated
the
order
as
to
the
acquisitions
of
additional
buses,
subject
to
this
being
reimposed
at
an
appropriate
later
time,
when
and
if
that
become
necessary.
however,
it
is
clear
that
the
case
was
decided
before
these
53
districts
were
given
any
chance
to
show,
that
they
had
committed
no
violation
of
anyone's
constitutional
rights.
we
granted
certiorari
to
determine
whether
a
federal
court
may
impose
a
multidistrict,
or
interdistrict
areawide
remedy
to
cure
the
segregation
of
one
district
and
to
do
so,
without
any
finding
that
the
other
included
school
districts
failed
to
operate
a
totally
unitary
system
within
their
districts,
without
any
claim
or
finding
that
the
boundary
lines
of
any
affected
school
districts
were
established
with
the
purpose
of
fostering
racial
segregation
in
the
public
schools,
without
any
finding
that
the
included
districts
had
committed
acts
which
effected
segregation
within
the
other
districts,
and
without
any
meaningful
opportunity
for
the
included
neighboring
outlying
school
districts
to
present
evidence
or
be
heard
on
the
propriety
of
a
multidistrict
remedy
or
on
the
question
of
constitutional
violations
by
those
neighboring
districts
affecting
the
primary
district.
ever
since
brown
against
the
board
of
education,
20
years
ago,
judicial
consideration
of
school
desegregation
cases
has
begin
with
the
standard
stated
in
that
case,
but
in
the
field
of
public
education
the
doctrine
of
separate
but
equal'
has
no
place.
separate
educational
facilities
are
inherently
unequal
and
this
has
been
reaffirmed
in
this
court
time
and
again
as
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
and
the
controlling
rule
of
law.
the
target
of
the
brown
holding
was
clear
and
forthright.
the
elimination
of
state-mandated
or
deliberately
maintained
dual
school
systems
with
certain
schools
for
negro
pupils
and
others
for
white
pupils.
in
further
refining
the
remedial
process,
a
unanimous
court
held
in
swann
against
charlotte-mecklenburg
board
of
education
in
1971
that
the
task
is
to
correct
the
condition
that
offends
the
constitution.
a
federal
remedial
power
may
be
exercised,
we
said
in
that
case,
only
on
the
basis
of
a
constitutional
violation
and
as
with
any
equity
case
and
these
are
the
words
of
that
holding,
the
nature
of
the
violation
determines
the
scope
of
the
remedy.
proceeding
from
these
basic
principles,
we
note
first
that
in
the
district
court
the
complainants
sought
a
remedy
aimed
at
the
condition
alleged
to
offend
the
constitution
and
that
condition
was
just
one
thing,
the
segregation
within
the
detroit
city
schools
and
the
court
found
that
it
did
exist
and
that
finding
is
not
challenged
here.
thereafter,
however,
the
district
court
abruptly
rejected
the
proposed
detroit-only
plans
on
the
ground
that
while
it
would
provide
a
racial
mix
more
in
keeping
with
the
negro-white
proportion
of
the
student
population,
it
would
accentuate
the
racial
identifiability
of
the
detroit
district
as
a
negro
school
system,
and
it
would
not
accomplish
desegregation.
viewing
the
record
as
a
whole
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
shifted
the
primary
focus
from
a
detroit
remedy
to
the
metropolitan
area
remedy
only
because
of
their
conclusion
that
total
desegregation
of
the
detroit
school
system
would
not
produce
the
kind
of
racial
balance
which
they
considered
desirable.
both
courts
proceeded
on
an
assumption
that
the
detroit
schools
could
not
be
desegregated,
in
their
view
of
what
constituted
desegregation,
unless
the
racial
composition
of
the
student
body
of
each
school
substantially
reflected
the
racial
composition
of
the
population
of
the
metropolitan
area
as
a
whole.
that
this
was
in
fact
and
realistically
the
approach
of
the
district
court
is
shown
by
the
order
which
expressed
the
court's
view
of
the
constitutional
standard
that
should
be
followed.
here
is
what
the
district
judge
said
in
pertinent
part
in
his
decision.
“pupil
reassignments
shall
be
effected
within
the
clusters
described
in
exhibit
pm12
so
as
to
achieve
the
greatest
degree
of
actual
desegregation
to
the
end
that
upon
implementation,
no
school,
grade
or
classroom
will
be
substantially
disproportionate
to
the
overall
pupil
racial
composition.”
in
doing
this
the
district
court
was
using
a
racial
head
account
not
simply
as
starting
point
as
was
suggested
in
the
swann
case,
but
that
is
the
objective
of
consolidating
the
53
outlying
districts
with
the
detroit
school
district.
in
the
swann
case
in
1971
which
arose
in
the
context
of
a
single
independent
school
district,
we
held
in
language
that
seems
to
be
quite
clear
and
i
use
the
court's
language
in
that
case,
if
we
were
to
read
the
holding
of
the
district
court
to
require,
as
a
matter
of
substantive
constitutional
right,
any
particular
degree
of
racial
balance
or
mixing,
that
approach
would
be
disapproved
and
we
would
be
obliged
to
reverse.
the
clear
import
of
that
language
from
swann
is
that
desegregation,
in
the
sense
of
dismantling
a
dual
school
system,
does
not
require
any
particular
racial
balance
in
each
school,
or
class
or
grade.
here,
moreover,
the
district
court's
approach
to
what
constituted
"actual
desegregation"
raises
the
fundamental
question,
not
presented
in
the
swann
case,
as
to
the
circumstances
in
which
a
federal
court
may
order
desegregation
relief
that
embraces
more
than
a
single
school
district.
the
controlling
principle
consistently
expounded
in
the
holdings
of
this
court
is
that
the
scope
of
the
remedy
is
determined
by
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
constitutional
violation.
substantial
local
control
of
public
education
in
this
country
is
a
deeply
rooted
tradition.
before
the
boundaries
of
separate
and
autonomous
school
districts
may
be
set
aside
and
they
maybe
in
some
circumstances
by
consolidated
--
consolidating
of
the
separate
school
units
for
remedial
purposes
or
by
imposing
a
cross
or
interdistrict
remedy,
there
must
first
be
evidence
that
there
has
been
a
constitutional
violation
within
one
district
that
produces
significant
segregative
effect
in
another
district.
specifically,
it
must
be
shown
that
racially
discriminatory
acts
of
the
state
or
local
school
districts,
or
of
a
single
school
district
caused
racial
segregation
in
an
adjacent
district
or
where
district
lines
have
been
deliberately
drawn
on
the
basis
of
race.
in
those
circumstances
an
interdistrict
remedy
would
be
an
appropriate
remedy
for
the
court
to
consider
to
eliminate
the
interdistrict
segregation
directly
caused
by
the
constitutional
violation.
on
the
other
hand
without
an
interdistrict
violation
and
some
interdistrict
effect,
there
is
no
constitutional
wrong
and
there
is
no
constitutional
basis
for
an
interdistrict
remedy.
the
record
before
us
in
this
case
is
very
voluminous,
but
it
contains
no
evidence
of
de
jure
segregated
conditions
except
in
the
detroit
schools.
that
of
course
was
the
theory
on
which
lawsuit
was
initially
brought
and
the
only
subject
on
which
the
district
court
took
any
evidence.
with
no
showing
of
significant
violation
by
the
53
outlying
school
districts
and
no
evidence
of
any
interdistrict
violation
or
effect,
the
court
as
i
have
already
suggested,
went
beyond
the
original
theory
of
the
case
as
framed
by
the
pleadings
and
ordered
a
54-district
metropolitan
area
remedy,
the
54
district
including
detroit
and
the
53
outlying
districts.
to
approve
the
remedy
ordered
by
the
court
in
these
circumstances
would
impose
on
the
53
outlying
districts,
not
shown
to
have
committed
any
constitutional
violation,
a
wholly
impermissible
remedy
and
one
based
on
a
standard
and
not
even
hinted
at
in
brown
i
and
brown
ii
or
any
holding
of
this
court
since
those
cases.
indeed
it
was
based
on
a
standard
which
specially
said
was
improper
in
the
swann
case
only
three
years
ago.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
so
that
the
segregation
already
found
by
the
district
court
to
exist
in
detroit
can
be
promptly
corrected.

the
respondents
in
these
cases
brought
this
class
action
alleging
that
the
detroit
public
school
system
was
racially
segregated
as
a
result
of
the
official
policies
and
the
actions
of
petitioner
state
and
city
officials.
they
sought
implementation
of
a
plan
to
eliminate
the
segregation
in
detroit
and
establish
a
unitary
nonracial
school
system
in
that
city.
the
district
court
concluded,
that
various
acts
by
the
petitioner,
the
detroit
school
board
of
education
had
created
and
perpetuated
school
segregation
in
detroit.
when
the
district
court
turns
the
question
of
an
appropriate
remedy
for
detroit
segregation
that
it
had
found,
it
proceeded
to
order
the
detroit
board
of
education
to
submit
plans
dealing
with
the
segregation
problems
found
to
exist
in
that
city
which
of
course
was
what
the
lawsuit
was
all
about.
at
the
same
time,
however,
the
state
defendants
were
directed
by
the
district
court
to
submit
desegregation
plans
that
would
include
the
three-county
metropolitan
area,
covering
a
total
of
1952
square
miles.
despite
the
fact
that
the
school
districts
of
these
three
counties
were
not
parties
to
the
action
and
despite
that
there
had
been
no
claim
up
to
that
time
made
by
anyone
that
these
outlying
counties
that
included
85
separate
school
districts
had
committed
have
committed
any
constitutional
violations
of
any
kind.
the
outlying
school
districts
through
them
allowed
to
intervene,
by
the
express
terms
of
the
order
of
the
district
court,
they
were
not
permitted
to
assert
any
claim
or
defense
on
issues
previously
decided
or
to
reopen
any
issue
previously
decided.
they
were
allowed
simply
to
advise
the
court
as
to
the
propriety
of
a
metropolitan
plan
and
to
submit
any
modifications
or
alternatives
to
such
plan.
without
taking
any
evidence
on
the
subject,
the
district
court
then
ruled
that
it
was
proper
to
consider
metropolitan
plans,
including
53
of
the
80
odd
outlying
school
districts.
and
within
a
few
days
after
that
the
judge
filed
his
decision,
holding
that
it
was
proper
for
the
court
to
consider
consider
metropolitan
plans
directed
towards
desegregation
of
the
detroit
public
schools
as
an
alternative
to
the
detroit
only
plans,
which
were
then
before
the
court.
the
district
court
then
issued
its
findings
and
conclusions
on
the
three
alternative
detroit-only
plans
submitted
by
the
city
school
boards
and
some
by
the
respondents
and
found
that
the
best
of
these
three,
as
the
court
viewed
one
to
be
the
best,
would
make
the
detroit
system
identifiably
negro,
thereby
and
i
used
the
terms
of
the
district
judge
now,
thereby
increasing
the
flight
of
whites
from
the
city
and
from
the
system.
from
this,
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
detroit
only
plan
would
not
accomplish
desegregation
within
the
corporate,
geographical
limits
of
the
city
of
detroit.
accordingly,
the
district
court
held
that
it
was
required
to
look
beyond
the
limits
of
the
detroit
school
district
for
solution
to
the
problem
as
it
saw
the
problem
and
here
i
use
his
words
again,
because
school
district
lines
are
simply
matters
of
political
convenience
and
may
not
be
used
to
deny
constitutional
rights.
the
district
court
then
issued
its
ruling
on
the
desegregation
area
and
the
related
findings
and
conclusions.
the
district
judge
acknowledged
at
the
outset
that
he
had
taken
no
evidence
with
respect
to
the
establishment
of
the
boundaries
of
the
85
school
districts
surrounding
or
at
least
near
detroit
itself.
nor
had
he
taken
any
evidence
on
the
issue
of
whether
these
outlying
school
districts
had
committed
any
acts
of
de
jure
segregation.
nevertheless,
the
district
court
then
carved
out
53
of
the
85
suburban
school
districts
plus
detroit
and
held
that
this
was
to
become
the
metropolitan
desegregation
area.
the
district
court
then
appointed
a
panel
to
prepare
and
submit
what
he
described
as
an
effective
desegregation
plan,
for
the
detroit
schools
that
would
include
the
entire
desegregation
area
with
the
total
of
53
school
districts.
the
court
ordered
the
detroit
board
of
education
to
purchase
or
otherwise
acquire
at
least
295
school
buses
for
the
purpose
of
providing
the
necessary
transportation
under
an
interim
plan
that
was
to
be
developed
immediately
or
partly
at
least
for
the
1972-1973
school
year.
the
costs
of
this
acquisition
of
these
295
or
more
buses
was
to
be
borne
by
the
state.
when
the
case
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
that
court
affirmed
in
part
and
held
that
the
that
the
record
supported
the
district
court's
findings
as
to
the
constitutional
violations
committed
by
the
detroit
board
and
the
state
officials.
that
therefore
the
district
court
was
authorized
and
permitted
to
take
the
effective
measures
to
desegregate
the
detroit
school
system
and
that
a
metropolitan
area's
plan
embracing
the
53
outlying
school
districts
was
the
only
feasible
solution
and
was
within
the
district
court's
equity
powers.
with
the
court
having
thus
decided
the
case
or
at
least
these
issues,
remanded
to
the
district
court
so
that
all
suburban
school
districts
that
might
be
affected
by
a
metropolitan
remedy
could
be
made
parties
to
the
lawsuit
and
have
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
as
to
the
scope
and
implementation
of
the
remedy.
it
vacated
the
order
as
to
the
acquisitions
of
additional
buses,
subject
to
this
being
reimposed
at
an
appropriate
later
time,
when
and
if
that
become
necessary.
however,
it
is
clear
that
the
case
was
decided
before
these
53
districts
were
given
any
chance
to
show,
that
they
had
committed
no
violation
of
anyone's
constitutional
rights.
we
granted
certiorari
to
determine
whether
a
federal
court
may
impose
a
multidistrict,
or
interdistrict
areawide
remedy
to
cure
the
segregation
of
one
district
and
to
do
so,
without
any
finding
that
the
other
included
school
districts
failed
to
operate
a
totally
unitary
system
within
their
districts,
without
any
claim
or
finding
that
the
boundary
lines
of
any
affected
school
districts
were
established
with
the
purpose
of
fostering
racial
segregation
in
the
public
schools,
without
any
finding
that
the
included
districts
had
committed
acts
which
effected
segregation
within
the
other
districts,
and
without
any
meaningful
opportunity
for
the
included
neighboring
outlying
school
districts
to
present
evidence
or
be
heard
on
the
propriety
of
a
multidistrict
remedy
or
on
the
question
of
constitutional
violations
by
those
neighboring
districts
affecting
the
primary
district.
ever
since
brown
against
the
board
of
education,
20
years
ago,
judicial
consideration
of
school
desegregation
cases
has
begin
with
the
standard
stated
in
that
case,
but
in
the
field
of
public
education
the
doctrine
of
separate
but
equal'
has
no
place.
separate
educational
facilities
are
inherently
unequal
and
this
has
been
reaffirmed
in
this
court
time
and
again
as
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
and
the
controlling
rule
of
law.
the
target
of
the
brown
holding
was
clear
and
forthright.
the
elimination
of
state-mandated
or
deliberately
maintained
dual
school
systems
with
certain
schools
for
negro
pupils
and
others
for
white
pupils.
in
further
refining
the
remedial
process,
a
unanimous
court
held
in
swann
against
charlotte-mecklenburg
board
of
education
in
1971
that
the
task
is
to
correct
the
condition
that
offends
the
constitution.
a
federal
remedial
power
may
be
exercised,
we
said
in
that
case,
only
on
the
basis
of
a
constitutional
violation
and
as
with
any
equity
case
and
these
are
the
words
of
that
holding,
the
nature
of
the
violation
determines
the
scope
of
the
remedy.
proceeding
from
these
basic
principles,
we
note
first
that
in
the
district
court
the
complainants
sought
a
remedy
aimed
at
the
condition
alleged
to
offend
the
constitution
and
that
condition
was
just
one
thing,
the
segregation
within
the
detroit
city
schools
and
the
court
found
that
it
did
exist
and
that
finding
is
not
challenged
here.
thereafter,
however,
the
district
court
abruptly
rejected
the
proposed
detroit-only
plans
on
the
ground
that
while
it
would
provide
a
racial
mix
more
in
keeping
with
the
negro-white
proportion
of
the
student
population,
it
would
accentuate
the
racial
identifiability
of
the
detroit
district
as
a
negro
school
system,
and
it
would
not
accomplish
desegregation.
viewing
the
record
as
a
whole
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
shifted
the
primary
focus
from
a
detroit
remedy
to
the
metropolitan
area
remedy
only
because
of
their
conclusion
that
total
desegregation
of
the
detroit
school
system
would
not
produce
the
kind
of
racial
balance
which
they
considered
desirable.
both
courts
proceeded
on
an
assumption
that
the
detroit
schools
could
not
be
desegregated,
in
their
view
of
what
constituted
desegregation,
unless
the
racial
composition
of
the
student
body
of
each
school
substantially
reflected
the
racial
composition
of
the
population
of
the
metropolitan
area
as
a
whole.
that
this
was
in
fact
and
realistically
the
approach
of
the
district
court
is
shown
by
the
order
which
expressed
the
court's
view
of
the
constitutional
standard
that
should
be
followed.
here
is
what
the
district
judge
said
in
pertinent
part
in
his
decision.
“pupil
reassignments
shall
be
effected
within
the
clusters
described
in
exhibit
pm12
so
as
to
achieve
the
greatest
degree
of
actual
desegregation
to
the
end
that
upon
implementation,
no
school,
grade
or
classroom
will
be
substantially
disproportionate
to
the
overall
pupil
racial
composition.”
in
doing
this
the
district
court
was
using
a
racial
head
account
not
simply
as
starting
point
as
was
suggested
in
the
swann
case,
but
that
is
the
objective
of
consolidating
the
53
outlying
districts
with
the
detroit
school
district.
in
the
swann
case
in
1971
which
arose
in
the
context
of
a
single
independent
school
district,
we
held
in
language
that
seems
to
be
quite
clear
and
i
use
the
court's
language
in
that
case,
if
we
were
to
read
the
holding
of
the
district
court
to
require,
as
a
matter
of
substantive
constitutional
right,
any
particular
degree
of
racial
balance
or
mixing,
that
approach
would
be
disapproved
and
we
would
be
obliged
to
reverse.
the
clear
import
of
that
language
from
swann
is
that
desegregation,
in
the
sense
of
dismantling
a
dual
school
system,
does
not
require
any
particular
racial
balance
in
each
school,
or
class
or
grade.
here,
moreover,
the
district
court's
approach
to
what
constituted
"actual
desegregation"
raises
the
fundamental
question,
not
presented
in
the
swann
case,
as
to
the
circumstances
in
which
a
federal
court
may
order
desegregation
relief
that
embraces
more
than
a
single
school
district.
the
controlling
principle
consistently
expounded
in
the
holdings
of
this
court
is
that
the
scope
of
the
remedy
is
determined
by
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
constitutional
violation.
substantial
local
control
of
public
education
in
this
country
is
a
deeply
rooted
tradition.
before
the
boundaries
of
separate
and
autonomous
school
districts
may
be
set
aside
and
they
maybe
in
some
circumstances
by
consolidated
--
consolidating
of
the
separate
school
units
for
remedial
purposes
or
by
imposing
a
cross
or
interdistrict
remedy,
there
must
first
be
evidence
that
there
has
been
a
constitutional
violation
within
one
district
that
produces
significant
segregative
effect
in
another
district.
specifically,
it
must
be
shown
that
racially
discriminatory
acts
of
the
state
or
local
school
districts,
or
of
a
single
school
district
caused
racial
segregation
in
an
adjacent
district
or
where
district
lines
have
been
deliberately
drawn
on
the
basis
of
race.
in
those
circumstances
an
interdistrict
remedy
would
be
an
appropriate
remedy
for
the
court
to
consider
to
eliminate
the
interdistrict
segregation
directly
caused
by
the
constitutional
violation.
on
the
other
hand
without
an
interdistrict
violation
and
some
interdistrict
effect,
there
is
no
constitutional
wrong
and
there
is
no
constitutional
basis
for
an
interdistrict
remedy.
the
record
before
us
in
this
case
is
very
voluminous,
but
it
contains
no
evidence
of
de
jure
segregated
conditions
except
in
the
detroit
schools.
that
of
course
was
the
theory
on
which
lawsuit
was
initially
brought
and
the
only
subject
on
which
the
district
court
took
any
evidence.
with
no
showing
of
significant
violation
by
the
53
outlying
school
districts
and
no
evidence
of
any
interdistrict
violation
or
effect,
the
court
as
i
have
already
suggested,
went
beyond
the
original
theory
of
the
case
as
framed
by
the
pleadings
and
ordered
a
54-district
metropolitan
area
remedy,
the
54
district
including
detroit
and
the
53
outlying
districts.
to
approve
the
remedy
ordered
by
the
court
in
these
circumstances
would
impose
on
the
53
outlying
districts,
not
shown
to
have
committed
any
constitutional
violation,
a
wholly
impermissible
remedy
and
one
based
on
a
standard
and
not
even
hinted
at
in
brown
i
and
brown
ii
or
any
holding
of
this
court
since
those
cases.
indeed
it
was
based
on
a
standard
which
specially
said
was
improper
in
the
swann
case
only
three
years
ago.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
so
that
the
segregation
already
found
by
the
district
court
to
exist
in
detroit
can
be
promptly
corrected.
