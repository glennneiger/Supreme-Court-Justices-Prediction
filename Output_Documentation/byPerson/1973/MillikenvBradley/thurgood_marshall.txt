justice
thurgood
marshall
in
brown
versus
board
of
education,
this
court
held
that
segregation
of
children
in
public
schools
on
the
basis
of
race
deprives
negro
children
equal
education
opportunities
and
therefore
denies
them
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
court
recognized
then
that
remedying
decades
of
segregation
would
not
be
an
easy
task.
subsequent
events,
unfortunately,
have
seen
that
prediction
bear
bitter
fruit.
but
however,
embedded
old
ways,
however
ingrained
old
prejudices,
this
court
has
not
been
diverted
from
its
appointed
task
of
making
"a
living
truth"
of
our
constitutional
ideal
of
equal
justice
under
law.
after
20
years
of
small,
often
difficult
steps
toward
that
great
end,
the
court
today
takes
a
giant
step
backwards.
therefore
i
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
justices
douglas,
brennan
and
white.
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
there
has
been
widespread
and
pervasive
racial
segregation
in
the
school
system
provided
by
the
state
of
michigan
for
children
living
in
detroit.
the
detroit
school
board
consciously,
drew
attendance
zones
along
lines
which
maximize
the
segregation
of
races
and
their
schools.
it
deliberately
created
optional
attendance
zone
for
neighborhoods
undergoing
racial
transition
so
as
to
allow
whites
in
those
areas
to
escape
integration.
negro
students
in
areas
with
overcrowded
schools
were
transported
past,
closer
white
schools
with
available
space
to
more
distant
negro
schools.
these
and
other
techniques
used
in
detroit
were
typical
of
methods
employed
to
segregate
students
by
race
in
areas
where
no
statutory
dual
system
of
education
ever
existed.
while
it
is
true
that
most
of
the
acts
of
segregation
in
this
case,
though
by
no
means
all,
were
committed
by
the
detroit
board
of
education,
it
is
clear
that
the
obligation
to
remedy
these
constitutional
violations
rests
ultimately
with
the
state.
the
command
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
that
no
state
shall
deny
to
any
person
within
its
jurisdiction
the
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
the
actions
of
state
agencies
like
school
boards
are
in
law
the
acts
of
the
state.
it
is
thus
the
state
which
bears
the
responsibility
under
brown
for
fording
a
non-discriminatory
system
of
education.
the
state
is
ordinarily
free
to
choose
any
decentralized
framework
for
education
it
wishes,
but
it
should
not
be
allowed
to
hide
behind
it's
delegation
and
compartmentalization
of
of
school
districts
to
avoid
its
constitutional
obligations
to
its
citizens.
vesting
responsibility
with
the
state
of
michigan
for
detroit's
segregated
schools
is
particularly
appropriate
here.
for
as
in
michigan,
unlike
some
other
states,
michigan
operates
a
single
statewide
system
of
education
rather
than
several
separate
and
independent
school
systems.
the
majority's
emphasis
on
local
governmental
control
and
local
autonomy
of
school
districts
in
michigan
will
come
as
a
surprise
to
those
with
any
familiarity
at
all
with
that
state
system
of
education.
school
districts
are
not
separate
and
distinct
sovereign
entities
under
michigan
law,
but
are
rather
by
the
decision
of
its
highest
court,
"auxiliaries
of
the
state'"
and
subject
to
its
"absolute
power."
the
courts
of
the
state
have
repeatedly
emphasized
that
education
in
michigan
is
not
a
local
governmental
concern,
but
a
truly
state
function.
yet
the
court
today
holds
that
the
that
the
district
court
was
powerless
to
require
the
state
to
remedy
its
constitutional
violations
in
any
meaningful
fashion.
our
prior
cases
have
not
minced
words
as
to
what
steps
the
responsible
officials
and
agencies
must
take
in
order
to
remedy
segregation
in
public
schools.
whereas
here,
state-imposed
segregation
has
been
demonstrated,
it
becomes
the
duty
of
the
state
to
eliminate
root
and
branch
all
vestiges
of
racial
discrimination.
as
was
said
in
swann
against
swann
against
charlotte-mecklenburg
where
de
jure
segregation
is
shown,
authorities
must
make
"every
effort
to
achieve
the
greatest
possible
degree
of
actual
desegregation."
if
these
words
have
any
meaning
at
all
surely
it
is
that
state
school
authorities
must
take
all
practical
steps
to
ensure
that
negro
and
white
children
in
fact
do
go
to
school
together.
in
the
final
analysis
this
is
what
a
segregation
of
the
public
schools
is
all
about.
but
a
detroit
only
decree,
the
only
remedy
permitted
under
the
today's
decision
cannot
effectively
desegregate
the
city
schools
in
detroit.
the
detroit
school
system
as
in
recent
years
increasingly
become
to
an
all
negro
school
system
with
the
greatest
increase
in
the
proportion
of
many
negro
students
of
many
major
northern
cities.
moreover
the
result
of
detroit
only
decrease
to
this
court
would
be
to
increase
the
flight
of
whites
from
the
city
to
the
outlying
suburbans,
compounding
the
effects
of
the
present
rate
of
increase
and
the
proportion
negro
students
in
the
detroit
system.
thus
even
if
a
plan
were
adopted
which
at
it's
outset
provided
in
every
school
a
65
negro,
35
white
racial
balance
mix
in
keeping
with
the
negro-white
population
of
the
total
school
population,
such
a
system
would
in
short
order
evolve
into
an
all
negro
system.
for
these
reasons,
the
detroit
only
plan
simply
has
no
hope
of
achieving
actual
desegregation.
under
such
a
plan
white
and
negro
students
will
not
go
to
school
together,
instead,
negro
children
will
continue
to
attend
all-negro
schools.
the
very
evil
that
brown
was
aimed
at
will
not
be
cured,
but
will
be
perpetuated.
the
rights
at
issue
in
this
case
are
too
fundamental
to
be
abridged
on
grounds
as
superficial
as
those
relied
on
by
the
majority
opinion
today.
we
deal
here
with
the
rights
of
all
of
our
children,
whatever
their
race,
they
have
a
right
to
an
equal
start
in
life,
to
an
equal
opportunity
to
reach
their
full
potential
as
citizens.
the
children
who
have
been
denied
that
right
in
the
past
deserve
better
than
to
see
fences
thrown
up
to
deny
them
that
right
in
the
future.
our
nation,
i
fear,
will
be
ill
served
by
the
court's
refusal
to
remedy
separate
and
unequal
education,
for
unless
our
children
begin
to
learn
together,
there
is
little
hope
that
our
people
will
ever
learn
to
live
together
and
understand
each
other.
desegregation
is
not
and
was
never
expected
to
be
an
easy
task.
racial
attitudes
ingrained
in
our
nation's
childhood
and
adolescence
are
not
quickly
thrown
aside
in
its
middle
years.
but
just
as
the
inconvenience
of
some
cannot
be
allowed
to
stand
in
the
way
of
the
right
of
others,
so
public
opposition,
no
matter
how
strident,
cannot
be
permitted
to
divert
this
court
from
the
enforcement
of
the
constitutional
principles
at
issue
in
this
case.
today's
holding,
in
my
view
is
more
a
reflection
of
a
perceived
public
mood
that
we
have
gone
far
enough
enforcing
the
constitution's
guarantee
of
equal
justice
than
it
is
the
product
of
neutral
principles
of
law.
in
the
short
run,
it
may
seem
to
be
the
easier
course
to
allow
our
metropolitan
areas
to
be
divided
up
each
into
two
cities,
one
white,
the
other
black,
but
it
is
a
course,
i
predict,
our
people
will
ultimately
regret
and
for
these
reasons
i
respectfully
dissent.
i
also
wish
to
announce
that
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
