justice
potter
stewart
mr.
jones,
before
you
do,
and
i’m
asking
this
primarily
simply
out
of
curiosity.
we
heard
in
the
last
case
about
the
fees
charged
by
the
communications
commission,
and
this
went
about
the
fees
charged
by
the
power
commission.
are
these
exceptional
or
is
it
the
rule
rather
than
the
exception?
in
other
words,
does
the
securities
and
exchange
commission,
does
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
does
the
various
other
agencies,
independent
agencies
and
commission
these
days
under
title
v
charge
the
industry
generally?
quite
apart
from
the
questions
of
filing
fees
or
not,
do
you
know?
justice
potter
stewart
your
impression
is--
justice
potter
stewart
that
these
are
perhaps
the
only
two
agencies
that
do
it
in
this
way,
apart
from
filing
fees.
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
where
is
the
statute?
have
you
got
it
in
your
--
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
i
rather
thought
that
the
groups
was
included
in
the
definition
of
“person.”
let
me
see
here.
justice
potter
stewart
to
or
for
any
person,
and
the
parenthetical
material
simply
makes
clear
that
the
definition
of
a
person
is
a
broad
definition.
isn't
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
that
your
argument
ultimately
has
to
be
then
that
a
whole
industry
can
be
a
person.
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
because
it’s
to
or
for
any
person.
and
you
would
agree
that
the
parenthetical
material
following
that
is
directed
to
the
definition
of
“person”
for
the
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
“person”
in
this
statute,
would
you
not?
justice
potter
stewart
in
other
words,
“person.”
and
there,
you
say
that
within
that
parenthetical
materials,
there
were
groups
which
you
say
can
mean,
therefore,
a
whole
industry
but
it
comes
back
to
whether
or
not
the
word
“person”
can
mean
a
whole
industry.
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
each
constituent.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
this
thing
of
value
performed,
furnished,
provided,
granted,
prepared,
or
issued--
justice
potter
stewart
to
or
for
any
person.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
whether
or
not
the
thing
of
value
to
or
for
any
person
can
be
read
because
of
this
parenthetical
phrase
to
mean
“to
or
for
an
industry,”
isn’t
it,
or
“all
the
persons
in
the
industry”
be
generally.
justice
potter
stewart
the
question
is
not
--
but
i
wondered
if
that
isn’t
the
question
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction?
justice
potter
stewart
so
long
as
i’ve
already
interrupted
you,
mr.
jones,
could
--
how
much
of
a
problem
would
it
be
for
you
to
supply
us,
after
sometime,
within
a
reasonable
time
of
the
practices
of
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
the
other
major
agencies
like
the
cab
and
the
sec
and
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
[voice
overlap]
about
whether
or
not
they
charge
their
--
the
industries.
the
industry
they
regulate
a
fee,
are
they
component
parts
of
the
industry
as
an
annual
fee?
justice
potter
stewart
title
v
does
this
for
many
years,
so
there
has
been
no
department
of
experiments
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
a
20-year
period.
justice
potter
stewart
of
course,
the
post
office
has
been
doing
this,
i
guess,
since
the
first
year
violation,
isn’t
it,
or
something
similar
to
that?
justice
potter
stewart
the
analogy
that
congressman
yates
saw
perhaps
was
what
follows
in
the
very
next
succeeding
paragraph.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
is
required
to
inspect
locomotives
of
railroad,
safety
appliances,
signaling
systems,
various
facilities
of
that
type.
in
addition
to
that,
much
to
the
work
of
the
commission
is
involved
with
hearings
and
so
forth.
they
say
the
government
pays
every
cent
for
this
operation,
i.e.
the
inspections,
the
safety
inspections
under
the
safety
appliance
act,
i
suppose.
that
perhaps,
was
the
analogy
that
congressman
yates
saw
the
inspection
of
elevators
in
his
hometown
of
chicago
and
that,
you
submit,
is
quite
different
from
rate
regulation.
justice
