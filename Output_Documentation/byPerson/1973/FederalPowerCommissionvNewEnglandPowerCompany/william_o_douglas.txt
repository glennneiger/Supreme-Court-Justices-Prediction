it’s
not

it

the

doesn’t
it?

in
these
two
cases,
mr.
justice
blackmun
and
mr.
justice
powell
take
no
part.
in
number
948,
first
one,
involving
the
catv,
a
trade
association,
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
mr.
justice
brennan
joins.
in
the
second
case,
federal
power
commission
versus
new
england
power,
mr.
justice
marshall
has
filed
has
concurred
in
the
result
in
a
separate
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
joins.
these
two
cases
involve
an
act
passed
by
congress
in
1952
called
the
independent
offices
appropriation
act,
which
authorized
each
federal
agency
to
prescribe
by
regulation,
such
fee
for
the
agencies
services
as
determined
to
be
fair
and
equitable
taking
into
consideration
the
direct
and
indirect
cost
to
the
government
for
the
value
to
the
recipient,
public
policy
of
interest
served
in
other
pertinent
facts.
in
the
first
case,
national
cable
television
association
case,
the
federal
communications
commission
established
a
fee
which
was
challenged
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
fifth
circuit,
and
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
sustained
the
commission’s
action.
in
the
second
case,
the
federal
power
commission
established
a
so-called
fee,
services
rendered
to
new
england
power
company
and
on
review
that
was
set
aside
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
we
conclude,
for
reasons
stated
in
two
opinions
filed
with
clerk
that
these
fees,
set
by
these
two
commissions,
did
not
comport
with
the
law
or
out
of
line
with
the
requirements
of
the
law.
and
that
both
agency
actions
must
be
disapproved,
which
results
in
reversing
in
the
national
cable
television
association
case
and
affirming
in
the
new

power
company
case.
