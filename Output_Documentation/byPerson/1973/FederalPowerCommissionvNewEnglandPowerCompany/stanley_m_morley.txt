mr.
stanley
m.
morley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
confining
my
argument
to
the
portions
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
relate
to
the
natural
gas
industry.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
at
the
outset
and
i
think
it’s
important
that
we
keep
in
mind
that,
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
as
to
the
natural
gas
industry,
it
involves
simply
natural
gas
rate
making
cost
on
behalf
--
incurred
by
the
federal
power
commission
in
the
regulation
of
the
pipeline
industry,
on
the
one
hand,
for
its
own
cost
incurred
with
respect
to
--
the
power
commission’s
own
cost
incurred
in
regulating
pipeline
rates,
but
it
is
also
imposing
upon
the
pipelines
the
cost
incurred
by
the
federal
power
commission
for
the
regulation
of
the
producers
incurred
in
connection
with
their
certification
procedures,
which
are
essentially
rate
making
procedures.
and
as
much
as
the
only
real
problem
that
ever
arises
with
respect
to
producers
certificates,
it
involves
the
price
which
they
are
to
receive
for
their
commodity.
now,
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
they
didn’t
--
the
court
below
did
not
reverse
the
federal
power
commission
on
the
basis
that
it
was
rendering
benefits
not
to
special
beneficiaries,
but
to
the
gas
industry
as
a
whole.
as
is
shown
in
the
opinion,
and
i’m
referring
to
pages
9a
and
b
of
the
government’s
petition
for
cert,
it
is
made
abundantly
clear
that
the
court
there
was
confining
itself
to
this
court’s
interpretation
in
the
hope
case
and
in
the
so-called
catco
case
or
atlantic
refining
co.
versus
public
service
of
new
york.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
this
is
in,
your
honor,
in
the
government’s
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
appendix
a.
what
i’m
looking
at,
your
honor,
is
at
the
bottom
of
pages
9a
and
the
top
of
9b.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
and
you
will
notice
there
in
the
footnote
that
the
court
did
determine
the
hope
and
catco
cases
to
be
controlling
in
as
much
as
it
is
concluded
that
the
only
benefits
derived
from
the
federal
power
commission’s
rate
making
actions
is
for
the
public
benefit,
namely,
the
ultimate
consumers
of
the
natural
gas
for
whom
the
gas
act
was
enacted.
now,
when
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case,
it
went
through
the
legislative
history
and
made
specific
reference
to
the
federal
power
commission’s
earlier
determination
in
order
no.
317,
which
was
a
rule
making
order,
which
proposed
for
the
first
time
the
assessment
of
fees
under
the
natural
gas
act
pursuant
to
the
requirements
of
title
v
of
the
independent
appropriations
act
of
1952
and
the
budget
bureau
circular
no.
a-25.
he,
there,
stated
that
he
wholeheartedly
concurred
with
the
commission’s
interpretation
of
title
v
and
order
a-25
in
its
earlier
rate
making
--
it's
earlier
notice
of
fee
schedules.
now
in
that
notice,
it’s
clear
and
we’ve
set
it
forth
--
it's
set
forth
in
the
commission
--
the
court’s
opinion
in
page
10a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
they
there,
point
out
that
they
have
reviewed
their
functions
under
the
natural
gas
act,
and
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
assessment
of
user
charges
or
fees
with
respect
to
the
exercise
of
regulatory
activities
under
the
act
and
accounting
provisions
would
not
be
appropriate
since
these
activities
are
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
the
general
public
rather
than
the
regulated
companies.
and
they
also
make
clear
that
they
didn’t
think
it
was
appropriate
to
charge
the
producers
the
cost
of
the
commission
in
administering
the
producer
programs.
they
first
pointed
out
that
it
was
difficult
for
administrative
convenience
and
that
it
was
--
and,
overall,
they
felt
that
it
did
not
come
within
their
entitlements
under
title
v.
now
this
--
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
well,
no
doubt
about
it,
your
honor.
however,
the
commission
passes
this
off
in
their
order
9
rehearing
as
mere
dicta
of
the
commission
as
though
they
had
not
given
serious
consideration
to
these
interpretations
of
title
v.
but
i
submit
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
title
v
does
show
that
not
only
the
commission
but
the
congress
has
given
most
serious
consideration
to
the
very
application
of
title
v
which
we’re
concerned
here
with
today.
now,
the
legislative
history
is
rather
sparse
and
i
assume
that
the
main
reason
for
that
is
that
it
was
attest
as
a
writer
to
an
appropriation
act
and
it
wasn’t
considered
a
serious
matter
as
conferring
legislative
authority
on
the
government
--
federal
agencies.
but
in
any
event,
it’s
abundantly
clear
and
it’s
made,
if
any
doubt
exists,
by
the
statement
of
senator
--
representative
yates
on
the
floor
of
the
house
when
he
was
discussing
title
v
of
the
independent
offices
appropriation
and
he
there
makes
specific
reference
to
two
agencies,
namely
the
federal
communications
commission
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
i
am
on
our
brief,
the
green
one,
and
that
is
appendix
b
pages
3a
through
5a.
you’ll
notice
on
page
3a,
your
honor,
he
refers
to
the
type
of
services
for
which
they
intended
to
recoup
the
costs
of
the
government
and
with
regard
to
the
federal
communications
commission,
he
refers
to
franchises,
licenses,
certificates
which
obviously
are
grants
to
identifiable
recipients
as
is
contemplated
by
title
v
and
budget
circular
a-25.
the
same
is
true
with
respect
to
his
reference
on
page
4a
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
which
makes
inspections
for
locomotives
of
railroad,
safety
appliance,
signaling
systems
and
also
for
the
issuance
of
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
for
bus
lines
and
other
common
carriers,
clearly,
identifiable
recipients
of
special
services
rendered
on
their
behalf.
now
after
the
enactment
of
title
v,
the
budget
bureau
on
november
5,
1953
issued
its
first
circular
which
was
also
designated
a-25.
but
that
circular
was
superseded
by
the
one
which
we’re
here
concerned
with
which
was
adopted
on
september
23,
1959.
shortly
after
that
promulgation
of
the
budget
circular,
the
federal
power
commission
got
out
its
first
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
for
the
assessment
of
fees,
that
was
issued
on
february
3,
1954.
and
they
therein
proposed
a
rulemaking
to
prescribe
fees
for
the
filing
and
processing
of
export-import
authorizations
under
the
natural
gas
act
and
also
for
the
charging
of
fees
for
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
under
section
7.
now,
there’s
a
great
deal
of
consideration
given
on
discussions
in
the
commission
--
in
the
senate
report
no.
14
and
67
which
we
have
referred
to
in
our
brief
at
page
22,
this
report
was
adopted
february
1,
1956
--
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
--
was
adopted
on
february
1,
1956
pursuant
to
senate
resolution
no.
140.
and
in
those
hearings,
the
senate
committee
on
--
was
considering
the
very
question
of
these
fees
and
whether
or
not
they
should
be
done
in
a
manner
prescribed
by
title
v
or
whether
or
not
they
should
be
individual
legislation
enacted
which
will
be
directed
to
each
of
the
individual
agencies.
and
in
the
course
of
this
--
the
hearings
that
were
held,
the
senate
committee
on
interstate
foreign
commerce
adopted
a
resolution
stating
in
which
the
sense
of
the
committee
that
the
agencies
under
its
jurisdiction,
which
obviously
included
the
federal
power
commission,
should
suspend
until
july
1,
1955
any
pending
or
proposed
proceeding
involving
the
imposition
of
fees
and
charges
pursuant
to
title
v.
then,
senator
bricker
also
stated
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
about
the
same
time
that
the
committee
on
interstate
foreign
commerce
is
of
the
unanimous
opinion
that
such
a
proposal
for
assessing
fees
raises
basic
questions
with
regard
to
the
fundamental
philosophy
of
regulation.
the
committee
feels
that
congress
should
set
up
the
basic
standards
for
each
agency
to
follow
in
imposing
charges
for
licenses.
so,
in
the
course
of
the
hearings,
the
then
chairman
of
the
federal
power
commission,
mr.
kuykendall,
was
--
wrote
a
letter
to
senator
mcclellan,
then
chairman
of
the
committee
on
government
operations,
in
which
he
responded
to
a
request
from
the
federal
power
commission
respecting
the
status
of
fees
charged
as
a
result
of
the
enactment
of
title
v.
mr.
kuykendall
referred
the
chairman
mcclellan
to
the
fact
that
they
had
issued
the
earlier
rulemaking
notice,
which
i’ve
referred
to,
and
then
stated
that
the,
“that
proceeding,
the
initial
rulemaking
proceeding,
is
still
pending
but
lies
dormant
in
view
of
the
resolution
of
the
senate
committee
on
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
that
such
proceeding
should
be
suspended
until
july
1,
1955
and
the
introduction
of
the
brick
bill
as
2203
in
the
83rd
congress
prohibiting
other
than
nominal
fees.”
then,
chairman
kuykendall
concluded
that
title
v
does
not
provide
a
sufficiently
explicit
expression
from
congress
with
respect
in
method
of
attaining
the
goal
of
self-sustaining
what
seems
lacking,
he
stated,
is
the
necessary
particularity
as
to
the
distinction
between
“services”
to
particular
groups
and
service
to
the
public
interest.
thereafter
--
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
there’s
no
question
about
it,
your
honor.
and
in
that
regard
though,
but
what
we’re
concerned
here,
with
so
far
as
the
natural
gas
pipeline
industry
is
concerned,
are
rate
matters.
the
annual
fee
assessment
for
their
pipeline
programs
which
they
say
is
the
cost
for
administering
their
rate
making
factor
--
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
not
in
my
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
no,
it
doesn’t.
they
--
the
federal
power
commission
says
that
what
they
do,
they
can’t
guarantee
you
a
profit.
they
will
give
you
the
opportunity
to
make
the
profit,
but
that
doesn’t
mean
that
you’re
necessarily
going
to
do
it.
now,
it’s
true
enough,
they
fix
--
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
well,
i
think
the
situation
is
more
or
less,
like
mr.
justice
brennan
put
it
earlier,
that
this
isn’t
sort
of
a
blue
cross
plan.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
--
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
excuse
me.
that
we’re
here
faced
with
an
industry
which
many
pipeline
companies
don’t
have
a
rate
case
for
years.
another
pipeline
company
will
have
several
in
one
year
and
now,
the
whole
--
the
industry
is
not
going
to
benefit
because
one
company
is
having
difficulty
raising
its
revenues
and
maintaining
an
adequate
stability
to
its
economic
environment.
i
don’t
think
that
it
necessarily
follows
that
the
whole
industry.
i
think
that
it
doesn’t
follow
that
the
whole
industry
benefits
from
any
of
the
rate
making
activities
of
the
federal
power
commission.
i’m
not
--
it’s
not
my
position
as
stated
by
counsel
for
the
government
that
unger
(ph)
is
saying
that
there
should
not
be
any
rate
regulation,
we
don’t
say
that.
we
say
that
the
cost
of
it
is
incurred
for
the
benefit
of
all
of
the
consumers
for
whom
this
court
has
said
the
natural
gas
act
was
enacted.
so
--
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
don’t
consider
this
apropos
of
the
problem
of
a
natural
gas
industry
being
regulated
in
its
rates.
it’s
--
obviously,
elevator
inspections
are
for
the
benefit
of
the
public.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
well,
he
has
more
--
this
is
sort
of
on
a
side.
as
i
read
the
thing,
he
is
more
concerned
with
the
federal
communications
commission
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
now,
there’s
no
question
that
this
man,
when
he
pays
his
fee
to
have
his
elevator
inspected,
his
got
to
have
as
a
prerequisite
to
getting
into
--
to
putting
the
thing
into
operation,
just
like
a
pipeline
has
to
get
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
operate
in
interstate
commerce.
we’re
not
challenging
those
fees.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
well,
there’s
a
benefit
to
the
extent
that
he’s
permitted
to
operate
his
elevator.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
well,
it’s
our
view
that
the
ultimate
consumers
who
are
the
beneficiaries
of
rate
regulation
under
the
federal
power
--
under
the
natural
gas
act,
the
activity
has
been
undertaken
for
them,
the
benefit
goes
to
them
and,
they’re
the
ones
that
should
pay
for
it.
the
natural
gas
pipeline
company,
what
benefit
does
he
receive
from
rate
reduction
or
a
rate
increase
of
less
than
what
he
thought
was
appropriate?
he
is
not
benefiting
by
that.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
i
don’t
think
so
because,
in
my
view
and
with
all
due
deference
to
your
own
view,
i
think
this
is
more
analogous
to
a
certificate
applicant
before
the
federal
power
commission.
the
elevator
owner
is
more
comparable
to
a
pipeline
seeking
a
certificate
than
is
the
elevator
operator
with
his
tenants
of
the
building.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
i
just
want
to
say
one
thing
that
in
connection
with
the
request
of
both
your
honor
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
the
icc
does
assess
fees
for
activity
such
as
are
mentioned
here
in
center
are
that
congressman
yates’
statement.
but
they
do
not
assess
fees
for
the
cause
of
their
rate
making
activities,
and
the
same
is
true
with
respect
to
the
federal
communications
commission
that
it
does
not
have
any
fee
assessments
for
its
common
carrier
rate
activities.
and
with
respect
to
your
honor’s
question
about
the
act
--
the
situation
with
respect
to
budget
circular
a-25,
you
will
find
in
the
senate
report
to
which
i
made
frequent
reference,
no.
1467
of
the
84th
congress,
that
that
budget
bureau
circular
was
circulated
to
all
of
the
federal
agencies,
including
the
federal
power
commission
and
notice
is
taken
of
it
by
the
congressional
committee
in
this
report.
so,
i
think
that
that
does
indicate
some
congressional
sanction
of
the
application
of
it
to
federal
power
activities.
thank
you.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
confining
my
argument
to
the
portions
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
relate
to
the
natural
gas
industry.
and
i
would
like
to
point
out
at
the
outset
and
i
think
it’s
important
that
we
keep
in
mind
that,
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned
as
to
the
natural
gas
industry,
it
involves
simply
natural
gas
rate
making
cost
on
behalf
--
incurred
by
the
federal
power
commission
in
the
regulation
of
the
pipeline
industry,
on
the
one
hand,
for
its
own
cost
incurred
with
respect
to
--
the
power
commission’s
own
cost
incurred
in
regulating
pipeline
rates,
but
it
is
also
imposing
upon
the
pipelines
the
cost
incurred
by
the
federal
power
commission
for
the
regulation
of
the
producers
incurred
in
connection
with
their
certification
procedures,
which
are
essentially
rate
making
procedures.
and
as
much
as
the
only
real
problem
that
ever
arises
with
respect
to
producers
certificates,
it
involves
the
price
which
they
are
to
receive
for
their
commodity.
now,
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision,
they
didn’t
--
the
court
below
did
not
reverse
the
federal
power
commission
on
the
basis
that
it
was
rendering
benefits
not
to
special
beneficiaries,
but
to
the
gas
industry
as
a
whole.
as
is
shown
in
the
opinion,
and
i’m
referring
to
pages
9a
and
b
of
the
government’s
petition
for
cert,
it
is
made
abundantly
clear
that
the
court
there
was
confining
itself
to
this
court’s
interpretation
in
the
hope
case
and
in
the
so-called
catco
case
or
atlantic
refining
co.
versus
public
service
of
new
york.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
this
is
in,
your
honor,
in
the
government’s
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
appendix
a.
what
i’m
looking
at,
your
honor,
is
at
the
bottom
of
pages
9a
and
the
top
of
9b.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
and
you
will
notice
there
in
the
footnote
that
the
court
did
determine
the
hope
and
catco
cases
to
be
controlling
in
as
much
as
it
is
concluded
that
the
only
benefits
derived
from
the
federal
power
commission’s
rate
making
actions
is
for
the
public
benefit,
namely,
the
ultimate
consumers
of
the
natural
gas
for
whom
the
gas
act
was
enacted.
now,
when
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case,
it
went
through
the
legislative
history
and
made
specific
reference
to
the
federal
power
commission’s
earlier
determination
in
order
no.
317,
which
was
a
rule
making
order,
which
proposed
for
the
first
time
the
assessment
of
fees
under
the
natural
gas
act
pursuant
to
the
requirements
of
title
v
of
the
independent
appropriations
act
of
1952
and
the
budget
bureau
circular
no.
a-25.
he,
there,
stated
that
he
wholeheartedly
concurred
with
the
commission’s
interpretation
of
title
v
and
order
a-25
in
its
earlier
rate
making
--
it's
earlier
notice
of
fee
schedules.
now
in
that
notice,
it’s
clear
and
we’ve
set
it
forth
--
it's
set
forth
in
the
commission
--
the
court’s
opinion
in
page
10a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
they
there,
point
out
that
they
have
reviewed
their
functions
under
the
natural
gas
act,
and
are
of
the
opinion
that
the
assessment
of
user
charges
or
fees
with
respect
to
the
exercise
of
regulatory
activities
under
the
act
and
accounting
provisions
would
not
be
appropriate
since
these
activities
are
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
the
general
public
rather
than
the
regulated
companies.
and
they
also
make
clear
that
they
didn’t
think
it
was
appropriate
to
charge
the
producers
the
cost
of
the
commission
in
administering
the
producer
programs.
they
first
pointed
out
that
it
was
difficult
for
administrative
convenience
and
that
it
was
--
and,
overall,
they
felt
that
it
did
not
come
within
their
entitlements
under
title
v.
now
this
--
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
well,
no
doubt
about
it,
your
honor.
however,
the
commission
passes
this
off
in
their
order
9
rehearing
as
mere
dicta
of
the
commission
as
though
they
had
not
given
serious
consideration
to
these
interpretations
of
title
v.
but
i
submit
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
title
v
does
show
that
not
only
the
commission
but
the
congress
has
given
most
serious
consideration
to
the
very
application
of
title
v
which
we’re
concerned
here
with
today.
now,
the
legislative
history
is
rather
sparse
and
i
assume
that
the
main
reason
for
that
is
that
it
was
attest
as
a
writer
to
an
appropriation
act
and
it
wasn’t
considered
a
serious
matter
as
conferring
legislative
authority
on
the
government
--
federal
agencies.
but
in
any
event,
it’s
abundantly
clear
and
it’s
made,
if
any
doubt
exists,
by
the
statement
of
senator
--
representative
yates
on
the
floor
of
the
house
when
he
was
discussing
title
v
of
the
independent
offices
appropriation
and
he
there
makes
specific
reference
to
two
agencies,
namely
the
federal
communications
commission
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
i
am
on
our
brief,
the
green
one,
and
that
is
appendix
b
pages
3a
through
5a.
you’ll
notice
on
page
3a,
your
honor,
he
refers
to
the
type
of
services
for
which
they
intended
to
recoup
the
costs
of
the
government
and
with
regard
to
the
federal
communications
commission,
he
refers
to
franchises,
licenses,
certificates
which
obviously
are
grants
to
identifiable
recipients
as
is
contemplated
by
title
v
and
budget
circular
a-25.
the
same
is
true
with
respect
to
his
reference
on
page
4a
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
which
makes
inspections
for
locomotives
of
railroad,
safety
appliance,
signaling
systems
and
also
for
the
issuance
of
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
for
bus
lines
and
other
common
carriers,
clearly,
identifiable
recipients
of
special
services
rendered
on
their
behalf.
now
after
the
enactment
of
title
v,
the
budget
bureau
on
november
5,
1953
issued
its
first
circular
which
was
also
designated
a-25.
but
that
circular
was
superseded
by
the
one
which
we’re
here
concerned
with
which
was
adopted
on
september
23,
1959.
shortly
after
that
promulgation
of
the
budget
circular,
the
federal
power
commission
got
out
its
first
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
for
the
assessment
of
fees,
that
was
issued
on
february
3,
1954.
and
they
therein
proposed
a
rulemaking
to
prescribe
fees
for
the
filing
and
processing
of
export-import
authorizations
under
the
natural
gas
act
and
also
for
the
charging
of
fees
for
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
under
section
7.
now,
there’s
a
great
deal
of
consideration
given
on
discussions
in
the
commission
--
in
the
senate
report
no.
14
and
67
which
we
have
referred
to
in
our
brief
at
page
22,
this
report
was
adopted
february
1,
1956
--
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
--
was
adopted
on
february
1,
1956
pursuant
to
senate
resolution
no.
140.
and
in
those
hearings,
the
senate
committee
on
--
was
considering
the
very
question
of
these
fees
and
whether
or
not
they
should
be
done
in
a
manner
prescribed
by
title
v
or
whether
or
not
they
should
be
individual
legislation
enacted
which
will
be
directed
to
each
of
the
individual
agencies.
and
in
the
course
of
this
--
the
hearings
that
were
held,
the
senate
committee
on
interstate
foreign
commerce
adopted
a
resolution
stating
in
which
the
sense
of
the
committee
that
the
agencies
under
its
jurisdiction,
which
obviously
included
the
federal
power
commission,
should
suspend
until
july
1,
1955
any
pending
or
proposed
proceeding
involving
the
imposition
of
fees
and
charges
pursuant
to
title
v.
then,
senator
bricker
also
stated
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
about
the
same
time
that
the
committee
on
interstate
foreign
commerce
is
of
the
unanimous
opinion
that
such
a
proposal
for
assessing
fees
raises
basic
questions
with
regard
to
the
fundamental
philosophy
of
regulation.
the
committee
feels
that
congress
should
set
up
the
basic
standards
for
each
agency
to
follow
in
imposing
charges
for
licenses.
so,
in
the
course
of
the
hearings,
the
then
chairman
of
the
federal
power
commission,
mr.
kuykendall,
was
--
wrote
a
letter
to
senator
mcclellan,
then
chairman
of
the
committee
on
government
operations,
in
which
he
responded
to
a
request
from
the
federal
power
commission
respecting
the
status
of
fees
charged
as
a
result
of
the
enactment
of
title
v.
mr.
kuykendall
referred
the
chairman
mcclellan
to
the
fact
that
they
had
issued
the
earlier
rulemaking
notice,
which
i’ve
referred
to,
and
then
stated
that
the,
“that
proceeding,
the
initial
rulemaking
proceeding,
is
still
pending
but
lies
dormant
in
view
of
the
resolution
of
the
senate
committee
on
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
that
such
proceeding
should
be
suspended
until
july
1,
1955
and
the
introduction
of
the
brick
bill
as
2203
in
the
83rd
congress
prohibiting
other
than
nominal
fees.”
then,
chairman
kuykendall
concluded
that
title
v
does
not
provide
a
sufficiently
explicit
expression
from
congress
with
respect
in
method
of
attaining
the
goal
of
self-sustaining
what
seems
lacking,
he
stated,
is
the
necessary
particularity
as
to
the
distinction
between
“services”
to
particular
groups
and
service
to
the
public
interest.
thereafter
--
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
there’s
no
question
about
it,
your
honor.
and
in
that
regard
though,
but
what
we’re
concerned
here,
with
so
far
as
the
natural
gas
pipeline
industry
is
concerned,
are
rate
matters.
the
annual
fee
assessment
for
their
pipeline
programs
which
they
say
is
the
cost
for
administering
their
rate
making
factor
--
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
not
in
my
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
no,
it
doesn’t.
they
--
the
federal
power
commission
says
that
what
they
do,
they
can’t
guarantee
you
a
profit.
they
will
give
you
the
opportunity
to
make
the
profit,
but
that
doesn’t
mean
that
you’re
necessarily
going
to
do
it.
now,
it’s
true
enough,
they
fix
--
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
well,
i
think
the
situation
is
more
or
less,
like
mr.
justice
brennan
put
it
earlier,
that
this
isn’t
sort
of
a
blue
cross
plan.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
--
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
excuse
me.
that
we’re
here
faced
with
an
industry
which
many
pipeline
companies
don’t
have
a
rate
case
for
years.
another
pipeline
company
will
have
several
in
one
year
and
now,
the
whole
--
the
industry
is
not
going
to
benefit
because
one
company
is
having
difficulty
raising
its
revenues
and
maintaining
an
adequate
stability
to
its
economic
environment.
i
don’t
think
that
it
necessarily
follows
that
the
whole
industry.
i
think
that
it
doesn’t
follow
that
the
whole
industry
benefits
from
any
of
the
rate
making
activities
of
the
federal
power
commission.
i’m
not
--
it’s
not
my
position
as
stated
by
counsel
for
the
government
that
unger
(ph)
is
saying
that
there
should
not
be
any
rate
regulation,
we
don’t
say
that.
we
say
that
the
cost
of
it
is
incurred
for
the
benefit
of
all
of
the
consumers
for
whom
this
court
has
said
the
natural
gas
act
was
enacted.
so
--
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
don’t
consider
this
apropos
of
the
problem
of
a
natural
gas
industry
being
regulated
in
its
rates.
it’s
--
obviously,
elevator
inspections
are
for
the
benefit
of
the
public.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
well,
he
has
more
--
this
is
sort
of
on
a
side.
as
i
read
the
thing,
he
is
more
concerned
with
the
federal
communications
commission
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
now,
there’s
no
question
that
this
man,
when
he
pays
his
fee
to
have
his
elevator
inspected,
his
got
to
have
as
a
prerequisite
to
getting
into
--
to
putting
the
thing
into
operation,
just
like
a
pipeline
has
to
get
a
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
to
operate
in
interstate
commerce.
we’re
not
challenging
those
fees.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
well,
there’s
a
benefit
to
the
extent
that
he’s
permitted
to
operate
his
elevator.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
well,
it’s
our
view
that
the
ultimate
consumers
who
are
the
beneficiaries
of
rate
regulation
under
the
federal
power
--
under
the
natural
gas
act,
the
activity
has
been
undertaken
for
them,
the
benefit
goes
to
them
and,
they’re
the
ones
that
should
pay
for
it.
the
natural
gas
pipeline
company,
what
benefit
does
he
receive
from
rate
reduction
or
a
rate
increase
of
less
than
what
he
thought
was
appropriate?
he
is
not
benefiting
by
that.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
i
don’t
think
so
because,
in
my
view
and
with
all
due
deference
to
your
own
view,
i
think
this
is
more
analogous
to
a
certificate
applicant
before
the
federal
power
commission.
the
elevator
owner
is
more
comparable
to
a
pipeline
seeking
a
certificate
than
is
the
elevator
operator
with
his
tenants
of
the
building.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
stanley
m.
morley
i
just
want
to
say
one
thing
that
in
connection
with
the
request
of
both
your
honor
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
that
the
icc
does
assess
fees
for
activity
such
as
are
mentioned
here
in
center
are
that
congressman
yates’
statement.
but
they
do
not
assess
fees
for
the
cause
of
their
rate
making
activities,
and
the
same
is
true
with
respect
to
the
federal
communications
commission
that
it
does
not
have
any
fee
assessments
for
its
common
carrier
rate
activities.
and
with
respect
to
your
honor’s
question
about
the
act
--
the
situation
with
respect
to
budget
circular
a-25,
you
will
find
in
the
senate
report
to
which
i
made
frequent
reference,
no.
1467
of
the
84th
congress,
that
that
budget
bureau
circular
was
circulated
to
all
of
the
federal
agencies,
including
the
federal
power
commission
and
notice
is
taken
of
it
by
the
congressional
committee
in
this
report.
so,
i
think
that
that
does
indicate
some
congressional
sanction
of
the
application
of
it
to
federal
power
activities.
thank
you.
