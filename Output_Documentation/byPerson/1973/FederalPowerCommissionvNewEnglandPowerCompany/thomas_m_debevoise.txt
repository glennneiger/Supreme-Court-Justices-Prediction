mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
time
before
lunch,
i
will
try
to
get
through
the
thinking
completely
different
concepts
under
an
act
which
has
no
similarity
basically
to
the
ones
you’ve
heard
so
far
this
morning
and
an
industry
that
is
not
regulated
at
the
federal
level
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
like
the
ones
you
have
just
been
hearing
about.
the
federal
power
act
gives
the
commission
no
licensing
authority
over
any
facility.
contrary
to
what
government
counsel
stated
this
morning,
the
federal
power
act
does
not
let
the
commission
insulate
the
electric
utility
from
destructive
competition.
in
the
period
since
it
was
passed,
the
companies
regulated
--
the
part
regulated
by
the
commission
has
had
its
share
of
the
market
decrease
by
over
20%.
it
does
not
have
comprehensive
rate
jurisdiction
over
the
industry.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
it’s
from
the
other
parts
of
the
industry,
your
honor.
in
the
case
of
your
natural
gas
pipelines,
the
commission
regulates
the
whole
industry,
but
is
not
true
of
the
electric
utility
industry.
there
were,
when
the
act
was
passed,
already
in
existence
public
--
local
public
agencies.
today,
their
number
is
over
2,000.
there
were,
just
starting
in
1935
rea
cooperatives.
today,
their
number
is
960.
the
federal
government
dam
building
program
was
just
starting.
tva
had
not
yet
expanded
to
take
over
the
northern
part
of
alabama
and
the
parts
of
kentucky
and
other
places
that
it
has
today.
now,
as
far
as
rate
jurisdiction
is
concerned
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
well,
your
honor,
i’m
speaking
of
it
in
fpc
terms.
their
only
jurisdiction
is
over
sales
from
one
utility
system
to
another.
now,
they
will
not
protect
a
company
such
as
otter
tail
power
company,
which
you
had
before
you,
from
having
the
other
systems
which
it
serves
taken
away
from
them.
there’s
no
way
they
can.
as
the
federal
dams
have
been
built
with
low
cost
federal
power,
more
and
more
of
the
smaller
systems
have
naturally
desired
and
been
able
to
switch
to
taking
the
federal
power
to
which
they
give
preference.
and
this
is
what
i
mean,
there’d
been
new
local
public
agencies
established
just
as
there
have
cooperatives.
a
retail
service
area,
in
most
areas
that
i
know
of,
is
free
to
elect
to
oust
the
electric
utility
that
is
serving
them
and
if
it’s
an
investor
owned
company
at
the
end
of
its
franchise
or
otherwise,
and
to
set
up
a
system.
there
is
no
market
protection
for
the
electric
utility
industry
under
the
federal
power.
now,
this
is
true
because
of
the
history
of
the
development
of
the
industry.
by
1935,
when
the
federal
power
act
was
passed,
the
industry
was
already
in
existence.
it
already
was
regulated
extensively
at
the
state
level.
federal
regulation
came
about
for
two
reasons
in
the
public
utility
act
of
1935.
one
was
to
give
some
regulation
for
the
benefit
of
investors
over
the
mushrooming,
holding
company
systems
which
were
competing
with
one
another
for
retail
properties
across
the
country
and,
in
some
instances,
were
abusing
financial
accounting
and
other
records
for
the
detriment
investors.
that
was
part
one,
the
public
utility
holding
company
act.
part
two
of
the
public
utility
act
was
the
federal
power
act
and,
here,
the
effort
was
just
to
regulate
at
the
federal
level
those
parts
of
the
electric
utility
business
which
it
was
felt
the
states
could
not
regulate.
and
it
spelled
out
right
in
section
201
that
the
regulation
is
limited
to
the
interstate
transmission
and
sale
in
interstate
commerce
of
electric
energy.
the
federal
power
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
under
parts
two
and
three
over
any
generating
station.
it
has
no
certification
authority
over
any
transmission
line.
it
does
not
regulate
any
rates
except
the
interstate
rates
of
the
local
power
companies.
now,
until
1965
and
your
decision
in
southern
california
edison
case,
the
percentage
of
revenues
over
which
the
fpc
even
claim
jurisdiction
was
down
around
2%
or
3%.
today,
they
claim
jurisdiction
over
7%
of
the
revenues
of
the
electric
utility
industry.
under
--
they
have
jurisdiction
over
none
of
the
revenues
of
some
of
the
companies
that
they
regulate
because,
again
contrary
to
what
the
government
said
this
morning,
every
public
utilities
subject
to
fpc
jurisdiction
does
not
have
rate
schedules
on
files
with
the
fpc
because
they
do
not
sell,
in
some
cases,
to
other
public
utilities.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
mr.
chief
justice,
to
turn
directly
to
your
question,
it
is
our
position
that
if
the
certificate
of
compliance,
as
discussed
this
morning,
is
a
license
or
a
certificate,
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
two
circuits.
now
turning
to
the
other
agency
practices
which
justice
stewart
mentioned
this
morning,
on
page
47
of
our
brief
there
is
a
listing
of
them.
the
only
one
that
i’m
aware
of
that
has
taken
full
advantage
of
title
v
for
annual
licenses
is
the
atomic
energy
commission.
there,
they
do
charge
annual
--
make
annual
charges
that
cover
two
license
fees
that
cover
the
regulatory
cost
associated
with
the
processing
of
licenses,
and
health
and
safety
compliance
and
inspection
activities.
they
do
not
attempt
to
charge
back
in
those
annual
fees
the
cost
related
to
rulemaking,
development
of
standards,
codes
and
criteria,
safeguard
activities,
and
the
administration
of
state
relation
programs.
but
the
cost
directly
associated
with
their
licensing
program,
they
do
charge
back
under
title
v.
and
there
is
an
error
in
our
brief
on
page
47
in
the
second
paragraph
where
we
refer
to
such
charges
as
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
page
47
in
the
first
full
paragraph,
line
7.
the
word
“nominal”
should
be
stricken.
there
is
nothing
nominal
about
the
aec
annual
fees
to
licensees.
now,
nepco
has
one
peculiarity
from
the
rest
of
the
companies
regulated
by
the
commission.
i’ve
told
you
that
the
industry
as
a
whole,
only
7%
of
their
revenues
are
regulated
by
the
federal
power
commission.
in
nepco’s
case,
as
a
member
of
a
holding
company
where
it
supplies
the
distribution
affiliates,
the
fpc
regulates
almost
100%
of
their
rates
and
this
becomes
important
a
little
further,
but
let
us
turn
now
to
just
what
the
fpc
does
regulate.
first,
they
have
the
authority
to
regulate
exports
of
electric
energy
from
the
country.
there
are
very
few
of
the
industry,
which
are
in
a
position
or
location
to
export.
second,
they
have
the
authority
to
approve
mergers
of
facilities
or
the
accepting
of
securities
of
another
system.
but
that
is
only
where
there
are
jurisdictional
facilities
involved
that
excludes
generation,
excludes
distribution,
and
it
is
only
where
the
sec
doesn’t
have
jurisdiction
under
the
public
utility
holding
company
act.
again,
it
is
not
a
section
that
has
many
applications
during
the
year.
next,
they
have
jurisdiction
over
security
issuances
by
public
utilities,
but
only
over
those
public
utilities
which
are
not
organized
and
operating
in
a
state
which
regulates
their
security
issuances.
there
are
very
few
of
such
companies.
next,
they
have
rate
jurisdiction,
again,
only
over
interstate
energy
transactions
which,
i
have
mentioned,
amounts
to
7%
of
the
industry’s
revenues
on
a
combined
basis.
now,
when
i
say
industry
revenues
there,
i’m
including
revenues
from
investor-owned
utilities
that
are
large
and
are
not
subject
to
the
fpc
jurisdiction
at
all.
the
utilities
in
texas,
for
instance,
which
are
not
interconnected
across
the
state
line,
they
are
not
subject
to
fpc
jurisdiction
and
their
rates
to
other
utilities
are
not
regulated
by
the
fpc.
now,
these
are
the
regulatory
activities
of
the
federal
power
commission
over
the
electric
utility
industry,
and
it
is
the
cost
of
these
activities
which
are
not
covered
by
the
filing
fees
they
have
established.
substantial
filing
fees,
in
the
case
of
rate
cases,
that
they
wish
to
recover
back
from
the
industry
as
a
whole,
those
that
are
subject
to
their
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
of
the
kilowatt-hours
of
jurisdictional
energy
transmitted
or
sold
by
those
utilities.
i
submit
that
for
most
of
those
sections
there
is
no
application
to
most
of
the
utilities
subject
to
the
fpc
jurisdiction.
in
connection
with
the
rate
regulation,
it
is
the
buying
systems,
the
several
thousand
systems
which
are
not
subject
to
fpc
jurisdiction,
which
are
the
beneficiaries.
it
is
they
who
go
before
the
appropriations
committees
and
urge
more
funds
for
the
fpc
for
rate
regulation.
now
the
fpc,
in
talking
about
the
benefits
which
the
industry
receives
from
its
rate
regulation,
said
that
it
is
redounded
to
the
benefit
of
the
electrics
by
creating
the
economical
climate
for
greater
usage
which,
in
turn,
strengthens
their
financial
stability
and
their
ability
to
sell
debt
and
equity
securities.
it’s
this
economic
climate
which
the
court
below
very
nicely,
without
going
into
it,
said
was
not
sufficiently
defined
to
be
a
special
benefit
to
the
electrics
and
just
what
does
the
fpc
mean?
as
i
told
you
before,
until
1965
in
the
southern
california
edison
case,
you
were
talking
about
a
couple
of
percent
of
the
revenues
of
the
electric
utility
industry.
actually,
when
chairman
swidler
came
on
board
in
1961,
there
was
one
man
at
the
fpc
looking
at
rates
of
electric
utilities.
we’re
talking
about
a
small
percentage
of
their
revenues.
the
sales
go,
of
the
major
categories,
48%
to
industrial
customers,
22%
to
commercial.
does
the
fpc
claim
that
they
have
created
the
economic
climate
by
their
rate
regulation
of
the
electric
utility
industry
that
has
caused
the
industrial
expansion
of
the
last
20
years?
that
appears
to
be
what
their
doing,
but
they
go
further
and
they
say
that
it
has
strengthened
their
financial
stability
and
their
ability
to
sell
debt
and
equity
securities.
well
nepco,
as
i
told
you,
is
100%
rate
regulated
by
the
fpc.
there’s
an
fpc
order
of
march
7,1972
at
47
fpc
732
where
the
fpc
had
to
admit
that
because
they
listened
to
nepco’s
customers
in
1971,
that
nepco
had
been
unable
to
sell
any
debt
securities
or
preferred
stock
for
a
period
of
eight
months
and
they
had
the
grant
from
emergency
relief.
most
investor
on
utilities
are
not
subject
to
this
kind
of
rate
regulation
jurisdiction
by
the
fpc,
but
certainly,
the
rate
regulation
jurisdiction
has
not
created
an
economic
benefit
to
the
companies
which
are
subjected.
now,
the
government
misstated
our
position
when
he
said
that
because
part
two
does
not
specifically
authorize
a
fee,
we
say
title
v
cannot
be
applied,
that
is
not
what
we
say.
we
said
that
the
subject
was
before
congress
in
1935
of
charging
fees
under
part
two
and
three,
that
they
specifically
amended
section
10
(e)
of
part
one
under
which
the
fpc
does
charge
all
of
its
cost
of
administration
of
part
one
against
licensees.
they
specifically
amended
it
and,
in
doing
so,
specifically
stated
that
they
were
limiting
the
cost
of
administration
to
be
recovered
through
fees
to
part
one.
that
was
enacted
and
that’s
legislative
history
at
page
11
of
our
brief
in
1935.
so,
we
have
the
case
of
congress
specifically
having
under
consideration
and
then
specifically
saying
just
what
the
fpc
could
charge
fees
for
under
parts
two
and
three
which
they
then
spelled
out
in
section
312
of
the
act.
and
under
section
312,
the
fpc
was
limited
by
congress
to
charges
for
special
statistical
services
and
other
special
or
periodic
services.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
yes.
now
in
addition
to
these
regulatory
features,
the
fpc
increasingly
in
recent
years
has
been
getting
into
the
matter
of
coordination
and
reliability.
they
do
so
under
the
authority
of
section
202
(a)
and
their
specific
authority
in
section
311
where
they
are
required
to
compile
all
sorts
of
facts
and
information
on
the
industry
to
have
it
available
for
congress.
now,
we’ve
heard
this
morning
that
their
activities
under
this
part
have
saved
us
money,
have
meant
we
do
not
have
to
invest
as
much,
have
meant
that
we’ve
become
more
reliable
and
enhance
our
competitiveness.
i
would
say
that
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
anything
of
that
kind.
in
a
minute,
i
will
read
to
you
from
their
publications
as
to
what
their
program
is
all
about.
the
one
thing
that
was
said
that
was
entirely
accurate
is
that
their
program
consists
of
monitoring
the
industry.
they
attend
our
regional
reliability
councils.
they
don’t
get
involved
with
the
engineering
in
depth.
they
ask
the
industry
to
set
up
tasks
forces
to
provide
them
with
the
information.
they
coordinate
it
and
correlate
it,
and
report
it
to
the
congress
and
to
the
american
public.
now,
i’m
not
saying
there’s
no
benefit
when
you
are
regulated
to
have
this
exchange,
but
i
am
saying
that
their
program
is
not
designed
and
does
not
directly
benefit
the
industry.
in
connection
with
that,
if
i
could
read
to
you
just
two
excerpts
from
the
national
power
surveys;
“the
national
power
survey
is
a
major
undertaking
by
the
federal
power
commission
in
cooperation
with
advisory
committees
drawn
from
all
segments
of
the
electric
power
industry
to
give
greater
impetus
to
the
trend
towards
integration
of
the
nation’s
power
systems.
in
our
opinion,
the
technology
of
large
scale
generating
stations
and
extra
high
voltage
transmission
interconnections
has
now
reached
the
stage
where
a
closer
coordination
of
the
construction
plans
and
operations
of
individual
systems
in
the
industry
is
highly
feasible
and
necessary,
if
the
consuming
public
is
to
receive
the
benefits
of
lower
cost
electricity
which
our
technology
now
makes
possible.”
now,
this
is
the
thrust
and
purpose
of
the
federal
power
act
and
everything
they
have
done,
lower
cost
electricity.
they
go
on,
“at
stake,
by
1980,
are
possible
savings
that
was
much
as
$11
billion
a
year
to
the
american
consumer,
not
to
industry.”
it
is
not
their
thought
that
by
taking
advantage
of
technology,
stockholders
could
line
their
pockets
if
stockholders
are
equated
with
the
industry.
it
is
savings
to
the
consumers.
the
uniform
system
of
accounts,
the
accounting
regulations
which
throw
cost
to
the
future
and
flow
through
benefits
today
are
all
designed
to
benefit
the
consumer.
as
far
as
the
stockholders
are
concerned,
in
nepco’s
case,
you
could
sell
your
stock
now
for
6%
less
than
you
could
10
years
ago
on
equivalent
basis
under
regulation
by
the
federal
power
commission.
it
is
not
the
industry
which
is
benefited
by
these
things.
now
going
further,
where
fpc
regulation
is
supposed
to
make
the
public
feel
secure
in
the
reliability
of
our
systems,
you
go
to
the
1970
survey
where
they
say,
“in
a
very
real
sense,
electric
power
is
the
lifeblood
of
a
modern
nation.
axiomatic,
to
this
point,
is
another,
namely,
that
it
is
one
thing
to
take
electricity
for
granted
as
all
of
us
have
come
to
do
in
our
daily
lives,
but
quite
a
different
thing
to
take
for
granted
that
it
will
always
continue
to
be
available.”
and
the
fpc
has
no
control
over
whether
or
not
it
does
continue
to
be
available
even
in
the
segment
of
the
industry
that
they
regulate.
they
cannot
order
a
generating
station
to
be
built.
they
cannot
order
a
transmission
line
to
be
built.
so,
i
think
it’s
appropriate
to
refer
to
the
legislative
history
that’s
set
forth
in
tennessee
pipeline’s
brief
--
tennessee
gas
pipeline
at
length
from
the
senate
report.
it’s
at
page
28
of
their
brief,
“where
there
is
joint
benefit
to
a
particular
beneficiary
and
to
all
of
the
people,
the
cost
should
equally
be
divided
and
where
there
is
doubt
as
to
the
degree
of
preponderance
of
benefit,
there
should
be
no
fee.”
here,
i
would
say,
on
this
record,
there
is
considerable
doubt
and
i
would
like
to,
in
closing,
quote
the
next
sentence
from
the
one
cited
by
the
government
in
connection
with
their
authority
to
change
their
mind.
the
next
sentence
in
the
city
of
chicago
case,
from
the
one
the
government
cited
is,
“what
is
required
by
the
rule
of
law
is
that
agency
policies
and
standards,
whether
or
not
modification
of
previous
policies,
be
reasonable
and
non-discriminatory
and
flow
rationally
from
findings
that
are
reasonable
inferences
from
substantial
evidence.”
now,
this
economic
climate
benefit
is
without
any
substantial
evidence
whatsoever
and
does
not
constitute
a
reasonable
inference
once
you’ve
determined
that
their
role
in
regulating
the
industry
is
so
small.
in
this
case,
we
have
not
objected
to
the
fees
for
applications
in
those
limited
areas
where
they
have
authority.
we
do
object
to
paying
and
having
our
customers
pay
the
cost
of
their
whole
program.
to
the
extent
there
is
any
meaning
to
it
being
a
benefit
to
the
industry,
it
is
the
customers
of
all
of
the
electric
utilities
in
the
country
which
should
pay.
at
the
moment,
they
do
pay
based
on
ability
to
pay
through
our
taxing
statutes.
to
now
say
that
the
customers
of
investor-owned
utilities
should
pay
all
of
these
costs
because
of
some
benefit
to
them
makes
no
sense
whatsoever.
tva,
the
cooperatives,
the
municipal
generating
systems,
they
all
participate
in
the
national
power
surveys,
in
the
reliability
councils,
were
all
interconnected.
customers
of
the
small
municipals
that
we
serve,
they
benefit
just
as
much
from
reliability
to
the
degree
that
the
fpc
promotes
it.
there
is
no
reason
whatsoever
and
title
v
does
not
authorize
the
switching
of
these
costs
to
just
the
customers
of
the
invest-your-own
systems.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
i
think
there’s
a
large
distinction
which
maybe
i
was
too
concise
on.
to
the
extent
that
we’re
talking
about
license
fees
where
the
government
gives
you
authority.
it
seems
to
me,
title
v
clearly
applies.
now,
as
i
understand
the
catv,
there
is
no
rate
regulation
there.
i
think
there
is
a
big
difference.
i
think
you
have
a
rate
regulation
and
the
implementation
of
government
policy
through
the
fpc
to
keep
electric
rates
as
low
as
possible,
those
they
have
jurisdiction
over,
is
something
that
can
hardly
be
said
to
be
a
special
benefit
to
regulator
and
it’s
certainly
more
a
matter
of
government
policy
and
a
benefit
to
the
purchasers
of
power.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
time
before
lunch,
i
will
try
to
get
through
the
thinking
completely
different
concepts
under
an
act
which
has
no
similarity
basically
to
the
ones
you’ve
heard
so
far
this
morning
and
an
industry
that
is
not
regulated
at
the
federal
level
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
like
the
ones
you
have
just
been
hearing
about.
the
federal
power
act
gives
the
commission
no
licensing
authority
over
any
facility.
contrary
to
what
government
counsel
stated
this
morning,
the
federal
power
act
does
not
let
the
commission
insulate
the
electric
utility
from
destructive
competition.
in
the
period
since
it
was
passed,
the
companies
regulated
--
the
part
regulated
by
the
commission
has
had
its
share
of
the
market
decrease
by
over
20%.
it
does
not
have
comprehensive
rate
jurisdiction
over
the
industry.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
it’s
from
the
other
parts
of
the
industry,
your
honor.
in
the
case
of
your
natural
gas
pipelines,
the
commission
regulates
the
whole
industry,
but
is
not
true
of
the
electric
utility
industry.
there
were,
when
the
act
was
passed,
already
in
existence
public
--
local
public
agencies.
today,
their
number
is
over
2,000.
there
were,
just
starting
in
1935
rea
cooperatives.
today,
their
number
is
960.
the
federal
government
dam
building
program
was
just
starting.
tva
had
not
yet
expanded
to
take
over
the
northern
part
of
alabama
and
the
parts
of
kentucky
and
other
places
that
it
has
today.
now,
as
far
as
rate
jurisdiction
is
concerned
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
well,
your
honor,
i’m
speaking
of
it
in
fpc
terms.
their
only
jurisdiction
is
over
sales
from
one
utility
system
to
another.
now,
they
will
not
protect
a
company
such
as
otter
tail
power
company,
which
you
had
before
you,
from
having
the
other
systems
which
it
serves
taken
away
from
them.
there’s
no
way
they
can.
as
the
federal
dams
have
been
built
with
low
cost
federal
power,
more
and
more
of
the
smaller
systems
have
naturally
desired
and
been
able
to
switch
to
taking
the
federal
power
to
which
they
give
preference.
and
this
is
what
i
mean,
there’d
been
new
local
public
agencies
established
just
as
there
have
cooperatives.
a
retail
service
area,
in
most
areas
that
i
know
of,
is
free
to
elect
to
oust
the
electric
utility
that
is
serving
them
and
if
it’s
an
investor
owned
company
at
the
end
of
its
franchise
or
otherwise,
and
to
set
up
a
system.
there
is
no
market
protection
for
the
electric
utility
industry
under
the
federal
power.
now,
this
is
true
because
of
the
history
of
the
development
of
the
industry.
by
1935,
when
the
federal
power
act
was
passed,
the
industry
was
already
in
existence.
it
already
was
regulated
extensively
at
the
state
level.
federal
regulation
came
about
for
two
reasons
in
the
public
utility
act
of
1935.
one
was
to
give
some
regulation
for
the
benefit
of
investors
over
the
mushrooming,
holding
company
systems
which
were
competing
with
one
another
for
retail
properties
across
the
country
and,
in
some
instances,
were
abusing
financial
accounting
and
other
records
for
the
detriment
investors.
that
was
part
one,
the
public
utility
holding
company
act.
part
two
of
the
public
utility
act
was
the
federal
power
act
and,
here,
the
effort
was
just
to
regulate
at
the
federal
level
those
parts
of
the
electric
utility
business
which
it
was
felt
the
states
could
not
regulate.
and
it
spelled
out
right
in
section
201
that
the
regulation
is
limited
to
the
interstate
transmission
and
sale
in
interstate
commerce
of
electric
energy.
the
federal
power
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
under
parts
two
and
three
over
any
generating
station.
it
has
no
certification
authority
over
any
transmission
line.
it
does
not
regulate
any
rates
except
the
interstate
rates
of
the
local
power
companies.
now,
until
1965
and
your
decision
in
southern
california
edison
case,
the
percentage
of
revenues
over
which
the
fpc
even
claim
jurisdiction
was
down
around
2%
or
3%.
today,
they
claim
jurisdiction
over
7%
of
the
revenues
of
the
electric
utility
industry.
under
--
they
have
jurisdiction
over
none
of
the
revenues
of
some
of
the
companies
that
they
regulate
because,
again
contrary
to
what
the
government
said
this
morning,
every
public
utilities
subject
to
fpc
jurisdiction
does
not
have
rate
schedules
on
files
with
the
fpc
because
they
do
not
sell,
in
some
cases,
to
other
public
utilities.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
mr.
chief
justice,
to
turn
directly
to
your
question,
it
is
our
position
that
if
the
certificate
of
compliance,
as
discussed
this
morning,
is
a
license
or
a
certificate,
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
two
circuits.
now
turning
to
the
other
agency
practices
which
justice
stewart
mentioned
this
morning,
on
page
47
of
our
brief
there
is
a
listing
of
them.
the
only
one
that
i’m
aware
of
that
has
taken
full
advantage
of
title
v
for
annual
licenses
is
the
atomic
energy
commission.
there,
they
do
charge
annual
--
make
annual
charges
that
cover
two
license
fees
that
cover
the
regulatory
cost
associated
with
the
processing
of
licenses,
and
health
and
safety
compliance
and
inspection
activities.
they
do
not
attempt
to
charge
back
in
those
annual
fees
the
cost
related
to
rulemaking,
development
of
standards,
codes
and
criteria,
safeguard
activities,
and
the
administration
of
state
relation
programs.
but
the
cost
directly
associated
with
their
licensing
program,
they
do
charge
back
under
title
v.
and
there
is
an
error
in
our
brief
on
page
47
in
the
second
paragraph
where
we
refer
to
such
charges
as
--
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
page
47
in
the
first
full
paragraph,
line
7.
the
word
“nominal”
should
be
stricken.
there
is
nothing
nominal
about
the
aec
annual
fees
to
licensees.
now,
nepco
has
one
peculiarity
from
the
rest
of
the
companies
regulated
by
the
commission.
i’ve
told
you
that
the
industry
as
a
whole,
only
7%
of
their
revenues
are
regulated
by
the
federal
power
commission.
in
nepco’s
case,
as
a
member
of
a
holding
company
where
it
supplies
the
distribution
affiliates,
the
fpc
regulates
almost
100%
of
their
rates
and
this
becomes
important
a
little
further,
but
let
us
turn
now
to
just
what
the
fpc
does
regulate.
first,
they
have
the
authority
to
regulate
exports
of
electric
energy
from
the
country.
there
are
very
few
of
the
industry,
which
are
in
a
position
or
location
to
export.
second,
they
have
the
authority
to
approve
mergers
of
facilities
or
the
accepting
of
securities
of
another
system.
but
that
is
only
where
there
are
jurisdictional
facilities
involved
that
excludes
generation,
excludes
distribution,
and
it
is
only
where
the
sec
doesn’t
have
jurisdiction
under
the
public
utility
holding
company
act.
again,
it
is
not
a
section
that
has
many
applications
during
the
year.
next,
they
have
jurisdiction
over
security
issuances
by
public
utilities,
but
only
over
those
public
utilities
which
are
not
organized
and
operating
in
a
state
which
regulates
their
security
issuances.
there
are
very
few
of
such
companies.
next,
they
have
rate
jurisdiction,
again,
only
over
interstate
energy
transactions
which,
i
have
mentioned,
amounts
to
7%
of
the
industry’s
revenues
on
a
combined
basis.
now,
when
i
say
industry
revenues
there,
i’m
including
revenues
from
investor-owned
utilities
that
are
large
and
are
not
subject
to
the
fpc
jurisdiction
at
all.
the
utilities
in
texas,
for
instance,
which
are
not
interconnected
across
the
state
line,
they
are
not
subject
to
fpc
jurisdiction
and
their
rates
to
other
utilities
are
not
regulated
by
the
fpc.
now,
these
are
the
regulatory
activities
of
the
federal
power
commission
over
the
electric
utility
industry,
and
it
is
the
cost
of
these
activities
which
are
not
covered
by
the
filing
fees
they
have
established.
substantial
filing
fees,
in
the
case
of
rate
cases,
that
they
wish
to
recover
back
from
the
industry
as
a
whole,
those
that
are
subject
to
their
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
of
the
kilowatt-hours
of
jurisdictional
energy
transmitted
or
sold
by
those
utilities.
i
submit
that
for
most
of
those
sections
there
is
no
application
to
most
of
the
utilities
subject
to
the
fpc
jurisdiction.
in
connection
with
the
rate
regulation,
it
is
the
buying
systems,
the
several
thousand
systems
which
are
not
subject
to
fpc
jurisdiction,
which
are
the
beneficiaries.
it
is
they
who
go
before
the
appropriations
committees
and
urge
more
funds
for
the
fpc
for
rate
regulation.
now
the
fpc,
in
talking
about
the
benefits
which
the
industry
receives
from
its
rate
regulation,
said
that
it
is
redounded
to
the
benefit
of
the
electrics
by
creating
the
economical
climate
for
greater
usage
which,
in
turn,
strengthens
their
financial
stability
and
their
ability
to
sell
debt
and
equity
securities.
it’s
this
economic
climate
which
the
court
below
very
nicely,
without
going
into
it,
said
was
not
sufficiently
defined
to
be
a
special
benefit
to
the
electrics
and
just
what
does
the
fpc
mean?
as
i
told
you
before,
until
1965
in
the
southern
california
edison
case,
you
were
talking
about
a
couple
of
percent
of
the
revenues
of
the
electric
utility
industry.
actually,
when
chairman
swidler
came
on
board
in
1961,
there
was
one
man
at
the
fpc
looking
at
rates
of
electric
utilities.
we’re
talking
about
a
small
percentage
of
their
revenues.
the
sales
go,
of
the
major
categories,
48%
to
industrial
customers,
22%
to
commercial.
does
the
fpc
claim
that
they
have
created
the
economic
climate
by
their
rate
regulation
of
the
electric
utility
industry
that
has
caused
the
industrial
expansion
of
the
last
20
years?
that
appears
to
be
what
their
doing,
but
they
go
further
and
they
say
that
it
has
strengthened
their
financial
stability
and
their
ability
to
sell
debt
and
equity
securities.
well
nepco,
as
i
told
you,
is
100%
rate
regulated
by
the
fpc.
there’s
an
fpc
order
of
march
7,1972
at
47
fpc
732
where
the
fpc
had
to
admit
that
because
they
listened
to
nepco’s
customers
in
1971,
that
nepco
had
been
unable
to
sell
any
debt
securities
or
preferred
stock
for
a
period
of
eight
months
and
they
had
the
grant
from
emergency
relief.
most
investor
on
utilities
are
not
subject
to
this
kind
of
rate
regulation
jurisdiction
by
the
fpc,
but
certainly,
the
rate
regulation
jurisdiction
has
not
created
an
economic
benefit
to
the
companies
which
are
subjected.
now,
the
government
misstated
our
position
when
he
said
that
because
part
two
does
not
specifically
authorize
a
fee,
we
say
title
v
cannot
be
applied,
that
is
not
what
we
say.
we
said
that
the
subject
was
before
congress
in
1935
of
charging
fees
under
part
two
and
three,
that
they
specifically
amended
section
10
(e)
of
part
one
under
which
the
fpc
does
charge
all
of
its
cost
of
administration
of
part
one
against
licensees.
they
specifically
amended
it
and,
in
doing
so,
specifically
stated
that
they
were
limiting
the
cost
of
administration
to
be
recovered
through
fees
to
part
one.
that
was
enacted
and
that’s
legislative
history
at
page
11
of
our
brief
in
1935.
so,
we
have
the
case
of
congress
specifically
having
under
consideration
and
then
specifically
saying
just
what
the
fpc
could
charge
fees
for
under
parts
two
and
three
which
they
then
spelled
out
in
section
312
of
the
act.
and
under
section
312,
the
fpc
was
limited
by
congress
to
charges
for
special
statistical
services
and
other
special
or
periodic
services.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
yes.
now
in
addition
to
these
regulatory
features,
the
fpc
increasingly
in
recent
years
has
been
getting
into
the
matter
of
coordination
and
reliability.
they
do
so
under
the
authority
of
section
202
(a)
and
their
specific
authority
in
section
311
where
they
are
required
to
compile
all
sorts
of
facts
and
information
on
the
industry
to
have
it
available
for
congress.
now,
we’ve
heard
this
morning
that
their
activities
under
this
part
have
saved
us
money,
have
meant
we
do
not
have
to
invest
as
much,
have
meant
that
we’ve
become
more
reliable
and
enhance
our
competitiveness.
i
would
say
that
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
anything
of
that
kind.
in
a
minute,
i
will
read
to
you
from
their
publications
as
to
what
their
program
is
all
about.
the
one
thing
that
was
said
that
was
entirely
accurate
is
that
their
program
consists
of
monitoring
the
industry.
they
attend
our
regional
reliability
councils.
they
don’t
get
involved
with
the
engineering
in
depth.
they
ask
the
industry
to
set
up
tasks
forces
to
provide
them
with
the
information.
they
coordinate
it
and
correlate
it,
and
report
it
to
the
congress
and
to
the
american
public.
now,
i’m
not
saying
there’s
no
benefit
when
you
are
regulated
to
have
this
exchange,
but
i
am
saying
that
their
program
is
not
designed
and
does
not
directly
benefit
the
industry.
in
connection
with
that,
if
i
could
read
to
you
just
two
excerpts
from
the
national
power
surveys;
“the
national
power
survey
is
a
major
undertaking
by
the
federal
power
commission
in
cooperation
with
advisory
committees
drawn
from
all
segments
of
the
electric
power
industry
to
give
greater
impetus
to
the
trend
towards
integration
of
the
nation’s
power
systems.
in
our
opinion,
the
technology
of
large
scale
generating
stations
and
extra
high
voltage
transmission
interconnections
has
now
reached
the
stage
where
a
closer
coordination
of
the
construction
plans
and
operations
of
individual
systems
in
the
industry
is
highly
feasible
and
necessary,
if
the
consuming
public
is
to
receive
the
benefits
of
lower
cost
electricity
which
our
technology
now
makes
possible.”
now,
this
is
the
thrust
and
purpose
of
the
federal
power
act
and
everything
they
have
done,
lower
cost
electricity.
they
go
on,
“at
stake,
by
1980,
are
possible
savings
that
was
much
as
$11
billion
a
year
to
the
american
consumer,
not
to
industry.”
it
is
not
their
thought
that
by
taking
advantage
of
technology,
stockholders
could
line
their
pockets
if
stockholders
are
equated
with
the
industry.
it
is
savings
to
the
consumers.
the
uniform
system
of
accounts,
the
accounting
regulations
which
throw
cost
to
the
future
and
flow
through
benefits
today
are
all
designed
to
benefit
the
consumer.
as
far
as
the
stockholders
are
concerned,
in
nepco’s
case,
you
could
sell
your
stock
now
for
6%
less
than
you
could
10
years
ago
on
equivalent
basis
under
regulation
by
the
federal
power
commission.
it
is
not
the
industry
which
is
benefited
by
these
things.
now
going
further,
where
fpc
regulation
is
supposed
to
make
the
public
feel
secure
in
the
reliability
of
our
systems,
you
go
to
the
1970
survey
where
they
say,
“in
a
very
real
sense,
electric
power
is
the
lifeblood
of
a
modern
nation.
axiomatic,
to
this
point,
is
another,
namely,
that
it
is
one
thing
to
take
electricity
for
granted
as
all
of
us
have
come
to
do
in
our
daily
lives,
but
quite
a
different
thing
to
take
for
granted
that
it
will
always
continue
to
be
available.”
and
the
fpc
has
no
control
over
whether
or
not
it
does
continue
to
be
available
even
in
the
segment
of
the
industry
that
they
regulate.
they
cannot
order
a
generating
station
to
be
built.
they
cannot
order
a
transmission
line
to
be
built.
so,
i
think
it’s
appropriate
to
refer
to
the
legislative
history
that’s
set
forth
in
tennessee
pipeline’s
brief
--
tennessee
gas
pipeline
at
length
from
the
senate
report.
it’s
at
page
28
of
their
brief,
“where
there
is
joint
benefit
to
a
particular
beneficiary
and
to
all
of
the
people,
the
cost
should
equally
be
divided
and
where
there
is
doubt
as
to
the
degree
of
preponderance
of
benefit,
there
should
be
no
fee.”
here,
i
would
say,
on
this
record,
there
is
considerable
doubt
and
i
would
like
to,
in
closing,
quote
the
next
sentence
from
the
one
cited
by
the
government
in
connection
with
their
authority
to
change
their
mind.
the
next
sentence
in
the
city
of
chicago
case,
from
the
one
the
government
cited
is,
“what
is
required
by
the
rule
of
law
is
that
agency
policies
and
standards,
whether
or
not
modification
of
previous
policies,
be
reasonable
and
non-discriminatory
and
flow
rationally
from
findings
that
are
reasonable
inferences
from
substantial
evidence.”
now,
this
economic
climate
benefit
is
without
any
substantial
evidence
whatsoever
and
does
not
constitute
a
reasonable
inference
once
you’ve
determined
that
their
role
in
regulating
the
industry
is
so
small.
in
this
case,
we
have
not
objected
to
the
fees
for
applications
in
those
limited
areas
where
they
have
authority.
we
do
object
to
paying
and
having
our
customers
pay
the
cost
of
their
whole
program.
to
the
extent
there
is
any
meaning
to
it
being
a
benefit
to
the
industry,
it
is
the
customers
of
all
of
the
electric
utilities
in
the
country
which
should
pay.
at
the
moment,
they
do
pay
based
on
ability
to
pay
through
our
taxing
statutes.
to
now
say
that
the
customers
of
investor-owned
utilities
should
pay
all
of
these
costs
because
of
some
benefit
to
them
makes
no
sense
whatsoever.
tva,
the
cooperatives,
the
municipal
generating
systems,
they
all
participate
in
the
national
power
surveys,
in
the
reliability
councils,
were
all
interconnected.
customers
of
the
small
municipals
that
we
serve,
they
benefit
just
as
much
from
reliability
to
the
degree
that
the
fpc
promotes
it.
there
is
no
reason
whatsoever
and
title
v
does
not
authorize
the
switching
of
these
costs
to
just
the
customers
of
the
invest-your-own
systems.
mr.
thomas
m.
debevoise
i
think
there’s
a
large
distinction
which
maybe
i
was
too
concise
on.
to
the
extent
that
we’re
talking
about
license
fees
where
the
government
gives
you
authority.
it
seems
to
me,
title
v
clearly
applies.
now,
as
i
understand
the
catv,
there
is
no
rate
regulation
there.
i
think
there
is
a
big
difference.
i
think
you
have
a
rate
regulation
and
the
implementation
of
government
policy
through
the
fpc
to
keep
electric
rates
as
low
as
possible,
those
they
have
jurisdiction
over,
is
something
that
can
hardly
be
said
to
be
a
special
benefit
to
regulator
and
it’s
certainly
more
a
matter
of
government
policy
and
a
benefit
to
the
purchasers
of
power.
