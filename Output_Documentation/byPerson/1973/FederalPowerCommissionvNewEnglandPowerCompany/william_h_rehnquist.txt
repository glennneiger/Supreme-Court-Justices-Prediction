justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
morley,
in
your
brief
that
the
statement
of
congressman
yates
that
you
are
reading
from
earlier
in
appendix
b
at
page
4a,
the
first
kind
of
home
spun
example
he
gives
of
the
type
of
thing
he
is
talking
about
there
at
the
end
of
the
first
paragraph
on
4a
is
the
chicago
elevator
inspection
program
in
his
hometown.
and
he
says
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
city
of
chicago
required
a
license
from
each
elevator
owner
from
in
order
to
underwrite
the
cost
of
this
inspection.
well,
certainly,
that
inspection
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
public,
isn’t
it,
and
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
individual
elevator
owner?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet,
that’s
the
example
he
thought
as
being
referred
to
(inaudible)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
on
the
point
of
benefit,
there
simply
isn’t
real
benefit
to
the
elevator
owner.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
can
say
that
about
any
type
of
thing
i
suppose,
but
so
far
as
conferring
some
sort
of
an
affirmative
benefit,
this
would
strike
me
at
any
way
as
being
something
that’s
completely
for
the
public
and,
yet,
congressman
yates
thought
it
was
clearly
the
kind
of
thing
that
would
be
included
under
title
v?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
elevator
owner
can
make
exactly
the
same
point
though,
can’t
he
and
yet,
apparently
that
wouldn’t
have
been
good
enough
for
congressman
yates?
