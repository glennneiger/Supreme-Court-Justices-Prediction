chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
72-1162,
federal
power
commission
against
new
england
power
co.
mr.
jones,
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
doing
that,
mr.
jones,
let
me
just
enlarge
on
it
a
little
bit,
if
i
may.
i
notice
that
the
language
of
the
title
v
is
that,
at
the
top
of
page
3,
the
head
of
each
federal
agency
is
authorized
by
regulation
to
workout
some
kind
of
fee
schedule.
i
have
wondered
whether,
when
you
responded
previously
to
mr.
justice
stewart
that,
as
far
as
you
knew,
only
the
fcc
and
the
federal
power
commission
had
moved
whether
this
was
a
first
step
in
an
experimental
exercise
of
the
authority,
these
were
two
first
steps,
or
whether
the
others
just
hadn’t
got
around
to
it
or
what
the
situation
is.
i
think
if
there
is
any
governmental
policy
that
is
relevant
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
i
think
that
that
should
be
included
with
your
information
about
what
agencies
have
proceeded
to
exercise
this
authority?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
hasn’t
been
exercised
until
now,
is
that
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
morley.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
i
suppose
a
regulatory
agency
can,
and
they
sometimes
do
change
their
minds
about
these
things,
don’t
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
page
are
you
on
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
to
watch
that
microphone,
mr.
morley.
it
gives
you
a
little
trouble.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
could
you
really
separate
those
things
into
tight
little
compartments
in
a
regulatory
agency,
mr.
morley?
some
things
benefit
both
the
public
and
the
regulated
industry.
some
are
more
particularly
for
the
public.
some
are
more
particularly
for
the
benefit
of
the
industry.
is
that
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
doesn’t
that
benefit
both
the
public
and
the
utility?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
doesn’t?
doesn’t
it
fix
an
assured
return
on
a
particular
formula?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
some
of
it
depends
on
management
then.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
of
it
depends
on
management,
but
within
the
framework,
it’s
--
there
is
a
formula
that
is
designed
to
give
a
profit,
is
there
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
stewart’s
conception
of
blue
cross
blue
shield
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
morley,
i
think,
you’ve
a
minute,
if
my
calculations
are
that
you’re
impinging
on
mr.
debevoise’s
time
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
debevoise.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
from
what
source
is
that
competition
that
you’re
suggesting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
say
they’re
not
protected
from
competition,
do
you
mean
within
their
own
area
or
they’re
not
protected
from
competition
in
the
sense
that
they
can’t
expand
into
areas
where,
for
example,
rea
or
tva
is
operating
on
municipal
ownership?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
debevoise,
neither
--
no
counsel
up
to
now
has
intimated
that
the
fifth
circuit
might
have
been
correct
and
that
the
dc
circuit
might
have
been
correct.
and,
i
wonder
if
after
lunch,
if
you
have
any
views
on
that
that
you’d
care
to
suggest
that
you
would
address
yourself
to
them.
we
will
resume
there
after
lunch.
[luncheon
recess]
mr.
debevoise,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
still
the
1935
expression,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
debevoise,
do
you
--
would
you
think
there
is
any
difference
in
approach
to
the
application
of
title
v
to
utilities
whose
rates
are
regulated
and
to
broadcasters
whose
rates
are
not
regulated?
is
there
any
basis
for
distinction
on
that
score?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
debevoise.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
jones?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
thank
you
