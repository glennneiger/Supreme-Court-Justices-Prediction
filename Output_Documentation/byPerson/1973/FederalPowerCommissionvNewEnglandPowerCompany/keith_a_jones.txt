mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government’s
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
issue
is
whether
the
federal
power
commission
under
title
v
of
the
independent
officers
appropriations
act
of
1952
which
we
have
been
discussing,
whether
the
federal
power
commission
is
authorized
under
that
act
to
impose
annual
fees
upon
the
electric
energy
and
natural
gas
companies
for
the
purpose
of
partially
deferring
the
cost
of
regulating
those
industries.
this
issue
is,
of
course,
closely
similar
to
the
one
discussed
in
the
preceding
case.
but
the
application
of
title
v
in
any
given
case
depends
on
a
large
part
upon
the
nature
of
the
government
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
one
of
the
issues
is
identical,
mr.
justice
douglas.
that’s
correct.
but
as
i
was
saying,
the
application
of
title
v
in
any
given
case
also
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
governmental
activities
in
question.
for
that
reason,
i
will
discuss
at
the
outset
how
the
particular
activities
of
the
federal
power
commission
for
which
the
fees
here
have
been
assessed.
the
power
commission
has
authority
to
regulate
two
industries,
electric
energy
and
natural
gas
industries.
in
connection
with
its
regulation
of
the
natural
gas
industry,
at
issue
here
are
certain
annual
fees
which
the
commission
has
imposed
in
connection
with
its
regulation
of
the
sale
of
natural
gas.
there
are
two
types
of
sales
in
question.
one,
from
producers
to
pipeline
companies,
and
the
second
is
resale
by
pipeline
companies
in
interstate
commerce.
in
regulating
producer
sales,
the
commission
reviews
the
contracts
between
the
producer
and
the
pipeline
company
for
delivery
of
natural
gas
at
the
wellhead.
the
delivery
of
natural
gas
at
the
wellhead
cannot
commence
until
the
commission
approves
the
contract
as
to
amount,
price,
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
sale.
the
approval
of
the
contract
takes
the
form
of
what
is
called
the
issuance
of
a
producer
certificate.
this
certificate
permits
the
pipeline
company
to
take
delivery
of
the
natural
gas
at
the
wellhead
and
to
begin
transporting
it
in
interstate
commerce.
instead
of
imposing
a
fee
for
the
issuance
of
each
particular
certificate,
the
commission
has
determined
to
impose
an
annual
fee
on
each
pipeline
company
based
upon
the
amounts
of
natural
gas
reserves
certified
for
delivery
to
that
company
in
connection
with
the
producer
certificate
program
during
the
year.
and
this
so-called
added
reserve
fee
is
the
first
of
the
fees
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
commission
is
also
responsible
for
regulating
the
sales
of
the
pipeline
companies,
as
i
have
indicated.
the
review
of
the
sales
by
the
pipeline
companies
takes
the
form
of
review
and
approval
of
pipeline
rate
schedules.
and
this
review
procedure
is
invoked
normally
by
the
filing
by
a
pipeline
company
of
a
new
rate
schedule.
ordinarily
or
at
least
frequently,
the
commission
permits
a
new
rate
schedule
to
go
into
effect
without
holding
rate
setting
hearings.
but
when
hearings
are
held,
as
is
frequently
the
case,
they
can
be
time
consuming,
expensive,
and
quite
complicated.
as
a
consequence,
the
rate
setting
proceeding,
pertaining
to
any
particular
filing
of
a
new
rate
schedule,
may
bear
a
little
direct
relationship
to
the
dollar
amount
of
the
rate
increase
which
is
being
sought.
for
that
reason,
the
commission
has
determined
that
it’s
more
equitable
to
impose
a
fee
not
on
the
basis
of
each
particular
rate
increase
filing,
but
rather
in
the
form
of
an
annual
fee
imposed
upon
all
pipeline
companies
on
the
basis
of
annual
sales.
that
is
the
second
fee
at
issue
in
this
case.
and
those
are
the
two
pipeline
company
fees
in
question
here.
the
commission
also
regulates
the
electric
energy
companies.
and
its
regulation
of
those
companies
is
similar
in
basic
outline
to
the
regulation
of
the
natural
gas
industry.
the
commission
has
responsibility
for
regulating
the
transmission
of
electric
energy
in
interstate
commerce,
and
the
sale
of
that
energy
for
resale.
in
carrying
out
this
responsibility,
it
conducts
what
is
called
a
coordination
and
reliability
program.
this
program
consists
of
a
region-by-region
monitoring
of
the
adequacy
of
electric
transmission
and
generating
facilities
in
connect
--
in
relation
to
the
growing
demand
for
electric
energy
and
the
shifting
pattern
of
its
use
from
season
to
season
and
from
day
time
and
night
time.
in
connection
with
this
program,
the
commission
is
authorized
to
direct
electric
utility
companies
to
interconnect
their
transmission
facilities,
one
with
the
other.
these
interconnections
minimize
the
likelihood
of
blackouts
and
brownouts
and
permit
the
electric
utility
companies
to
share
their
generating
facilities
in
effect,
rather
than
relying
entirely
upon
their
own
generating
facilities.
since
this
coordination
and
reliability
program
is
conducted
on
an
industry-wide
basis
and
not
at
the
instance
of
any
particular
company,
the
commission
is
determined
that
the
only
fair
and
practical
means
of
allocating
the
cost
of
the
program
is
through
an
industry-wide
assessment.
and
that
assessment
is
the
third
of
the
fees
at
issue
here.
the
commission
also
regulates
the
rates
charged
by
electric
utility
companies
in
their
sale
of
electric
energy
for
resale.
the
electric
utility
companies
file
new
rate
schedules
and
the
commission
has
imposed
a
sliding
scale
fee
for
the
filing
of
a
right
schedule,
and
it’s
anticipated
that
the
sliding
scale
fee
will
cover
the
major
portion
of
the
cost
of
the
commission’s
electric
utility
rate
setting
activities.
but
since
those
activities
or
the
cost
of
those
activities
cannot
be
known
until
the
end
of
the
year
for
any
given
year
and
also
because
the
commission
undertakes
certain
incidental
regulatory
activities
for
which
there’s
no
set
fee,
it
is
anticipated
that
the
sliding
scale
fees
will
not
cover
the
full
pertinent
regulatory
cost
here.
for
that
reason,
the
commission
has
also
imposed
an
annual
fee
on
the
electric
utility
companies
to
cover
the
residual
cost
of
rate
setting
and
other
incidental
costs.
to
recapitulate,
there
are
four
fees
here
at
issue.
the
added
reserve
fee
on
the
pipeline
companies
in
connection
with
the
producer
certificate
program,
the
fee
on
the
pipeline
companies
to
cover
the
cost
of
rate
setting
activities,
the
fee
on
the
electric
utility
companies
to
cover
the
cost
of
the
coordination
and
reliability
program,
and
finally
the
fee
on
the
electric
utility
companies
to
cover
certain
residual
and
incidental
costs.
the
court
of
appeals
held
all
four
fees
to
be
invalid.
the
court
determined
that
a
fee
is
justified
under
title
v
only
if
it
is
in
return
for
the
conferral
of
a
special
benefit.
and
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
not
special
benefit
conferred
on
the
two
industries
here
in
question.
the
court
went
on
to
add
that,
in
its
view,
the
imposition
of
fees
of
this
kind
was
somehow
inconsistent
with
the
commission’s
responsibility
for
regulating
in
a
public
interest.
i
will
now
turn
to
the
legal
issues
which
are
raised
by
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
frankly,
i
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
have
assumed
that
such
industry-wide
fees
of
this
kind
have
not
been
imposed
by
the
other
regulatory
commissions
as
of
yet.
but
i
can’t
say
that
with
any
certainty.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
my
impression.
that’s
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it
may
be
that
other
agencies
have
recently
imposed
such
fees
or
are
giving
serious
consideration
to
doing
so.
but,
so
far
as
i
know,
there
are
no
other
annual
fees
of
this
kind.
but,
again,
i
say
that
i’m
not
positive.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
before
turning
to
a
discussion
of
the
kinds
of
issues
that
were
discussed
under
title
v
in
the
previous
case.
it’s
necessary,
i
think,
to
deal
with
what
properly
considered
is
probably
peripheral
issue
here.
but
title
v,
when
it
authorized
the
imposition
of
certain
fees,
included
a
proviso
which
stated
that
no
statute
prohibiting
the
collection
or
imposition
of
any
fee
was
thereby
repealed.
the
new
england
power
co.
here
has
seized
upon
that
proviso
and
contended
that
the
federal
power
commission
drives
no
authority
at
all
under
title
v.
i
think
it’s
necessary
to
turn
our
attention
to
that
only
briefly.
the
company’s
argument
is
that
since
the
federal
power
act
itself
did
not
authorize
the
imposition
of
fees
of
this
kind.
therefore,
that
must
be
taken
to
be
an
implicit
prohibition
on
the
imposition
of
fees
and,
therefore,
that
the
proviso
prohibits
the
federal
power
commission
from
imposing
any
fees.
but
the
title
v
proviso,
by
its
very
terms,
was
intended
only
to
ensure
that
the
statute
would
not
be
construed
as
repealing
any
expressed
prohibition
that
was
already
on
the
books.
the
house
report
accompanying
title
v
described
it
“as
providing
authority
for
government
agencies
to
make
charges
for
services
and
cases
where
no
charge
is
made
at
present.”
the
basic
purpose
of
title
v
was
to
confer
authority
where
none
previously
existed.
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
clear
beyond
any
serious
question,
that
the
commission
does
have
authority
under
title
v
to
impose
fees.
an
issue
posed
by
this
case
is
whether
that
authority
extends
to
the
particular
fees
in
question.
title
v
speaks
in
terms
of
work
performed,
services
or
benefits
provided,
or
privileges
granted
to
or
for
any
person,
including
groups.
now
one
of
the
major
points
of
contention
in
these
cases
is
whether
the
statutory
phrase
“any
person,
including
groups”
can
in
an
appropriate
case
be
applied
to
an
industry
as
an
entity.
it
seems
obvious
to
us
that
that
statutory
phrase
does
embrace
the
companies
that
comprise
a
single
industry.
an
industry
consists
of
a
group
of
companies
and
groups
are
covered
by
the
explicit
language
of
the
statute.
moreover
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
in
our
brief,
it’s
on
pages
2
and
3.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
right.
it
says
to
or
for
any
person
(including
groups,
associations,
organization,
etcetera),
reading
on
the
bottom
page
of
page
2.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well
there,
i
suppose,
would
be
two
parallel
arguments.
one
is
that
coal
industry
can
be
a
person.
secondly,
that
when
each
member
of
an
industry
has
work
performed
on
its
behalf,
then
a
fee
as
to
each
member
is
appropriate
and,
therefore,
a
fee
as
to
all
members
is
appropriate.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
definition
or
an
elaboration
of
the
meaning.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
as
i
say,
the
fee
of
course
is
not
imposed
on
the
industry
qua-industry.
it’s
imposed
on
each
of
the
separate
members
of
the
industry.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
clearly,
each
company
is
a
person,
so
that
in
that
sense,
a
fee
as
to
each
member
of
the
industry
would
clearly
seems
to
be
authorized
under
title
v.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
question
would
be,
i
suppose,
whether
the
word
“performed--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
--
for
the
industry”
is
for
each
member
of
the
industry.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
think
i
understand
you
and
i
think
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
but,
i’m
not
fully
sure.[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
think
the
question
is
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
as
it
arises
in
this
case,
is
whether
an
industry-wide
benefit,
that
is
a
benefit
or
work
performed
for
the
whole
industry
indivisibly,
nevertheless
is
a
benefit
to
or
for
the
constituent
members
of
that
industry
for
purposes
of
title
v.
and
our
position
is
that
the
bare
language
of
the
statute
certainly
permits
that
construction
and,
furthermore,
that
there
is
certainly
no
policy
reason
why
an
agency
which
confers
a
benefit
on
an
industry
as
a
group
should
not
be
able
to
assess
a
properly
allocated
fee
as
to
each
member
of
that
industry.
that,
at
any
rate,
is
our
contention
with
respect
to
this
aspect
of
title
v.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
we
could
make
a
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
we
could
make
a
survey
of
that
kind
and
let
you
know.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
we
will
be
happy
to
do
that
and
supply
the
court
with
an
admission.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
the
answer
to
that
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
the
origin
of
the
fees
in
these
two
cases
is
fairly
clear
from
the
statement
of
the
facts
in
the
respective
briefs.
the
relevant
appropriations
committees
of
the
congress
have
been
urging
that
these
two
commissions
certainly,
for
some
time
in
the
past,
to
impose
fees
of
this
kind.
and
it’s
in
response
to
the
congress’
suggestion
that
these
fees
have
been
imposed.
for
that
reason,
i
doubt
that
there’s
been
a
coordination
of
policy
by
all
the
independent
agencies.
i
think
that
these
two
agencies
are
moving
in
response
to
perceived
congressional
demands.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
right.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
right.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it’s
been
a
discretionary
authority
which,
at
least
by
these
two
agencies,
has
not
been
exercised
in
this
manner
in
the
past.
the
federal
power
commission
did
impose
fees
upon
the
certification
of
--
excuse
me,
on
the
issue
in
certificates
in
public
convenience
and
necessity
several
years
ago
and
that
was
the
exercise
of
authority
under
title
v.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it
certainly
imposes
a
user
fee,
that’s
correct.
the
respondents’
contention
about
the
fee
not
being
applicable
to
industries
on
account
of
industry-wide
benefits
is
based
upon
a
budget
circular
a-25
which
was
discussed
in
the
preceding
case.
we
would
simply
point
out
here
that
that
budget
circular
does
not
require
the
kind
of
restrictive
reading
which
the
power
company
and
the
natural
gas
companies
would
give
it.
that
does
speak
in
terms
of
measurable
unit
of
service
to
identifiable
recipients.
but
again,
if
an
industry
as
such
would
identify
a
recipient
of
a
benefit,
then
nothing
in
the
budge
circular
by
its
terms
would
prohibit
the
assessment
of
an
industry-wide
fee.
furthermore,
as
my
colleague
mr.
korman
pointed
out
in
the
preceding
case,
that
budget
circular
does
not
apply
to
independent
agencies.
it
merely
sets
forth
a
general
fee
setting
policy
for
the
executive
branch
agencies.
turning
now
to
the
question
of
whether
the
commission,
in
performing
the
regulatory
activities
here
in
question,
performs
work,
provides
a
service
or
a
benefit,
or
grants
a
privilege
to
or
for
the
companies
in
these
industries;
this
is
a
question
which
must
be
considered,
i
think,
on
a
fee-by-fee
basis.
i
turn,
first,
therefore
to
the
added
reserve
fee
which
the
commission
has
imposed
upon
the
pipeline
companies
in
connection
with
the
producer
certificate
program.
that
fee,
it
should
be
pointed
out
at
the
outset,
is
not
an
industry-wide
fee.
that
is,
it’s
not
a
fee
which
is
assessed
in
amount
and
then
arbitrarily
allocated
among
the
constituent
members
of
the
industry.
it’s
a
fee
which
is
imposed
only
on
those
pipeline
companies
for
which
new
reserves
have
been
certified
for
delivery
under
the
producer
certificate
program
during
that
year.
the
certification
of
the
contract
for
the
delivery
of
reserves
at
that
kind
is
analogous
in
purpose
and
effect
to
a
license
for
the
conduct
of
additional
business.
and
it’s
clearly
of
benefit
to
the
company
because
it
thereby
secures
additional
supplies
which
would
not
otherwise
be
available
to
it.
and,
this
added
reserve
fee,
which
is
imposed,
is
imposed
in
a
manner
directly
proportional
to
the
amount
of
reserves
which
have
been
certified
to
that
company
for
the
year.
therefore,
it’s
proportional
to
the
benefit
actually
received
by
the
company
in
connection
with
the
producer
certificate
program.
because
of
this,
we
believe
that
no
matter
how
this
court
decides
the
other
issues
in
the
case,
the
added
reserve
fees
is
clearly
valid
under
title
v.
now,
the
other
fees
at
issue
here
are
imposed
on
an
industry-wide
basis.
that
is,
the
full
amount
of
the
fee
is
first
determined
and
then
it’s
allocated
among
the
various
members
of
the
industry.
the
fee
imposed
upon
the
electric
utility
companies
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
the
coordination
and
reliability
program
relates
to
beneficial
service
which
is
provided
to
the
entire
industry
as
a
whole.
in
conducting
the
coordination
and
reliability
program,
the
commission
comprehensively
studies
the
growing
market
for
electric
energy
and
it
also
studies
the
ability
of
the
existing
generating
and
transmission
facilities
to
meet
the
needs
of
that
market.
this
study
assists
the
companies
in
planning
their
capital
budgeting
and
it
facilitates
their
interconnection
and
cooperation
with
other
electric
energy
companies.
as
a
consequence,
they
save
money.
they
don’t
have
to
invest
in
generating
facilities
to
the
extent
that
they
otherwise
would
and
moreover,
the
delivery
of
electric
energy
becomes
more
reliable,
the
incidence
of
blackouts
and
brownouts
is
reduced.
and
this
increased
reliability
of
the
electric
energy
transmitted
by
the
companies
enhances
the
competitiveness
of
the
companies
vis-à-vis
other
fuel
suppliers.
because
of
this,
it
seems
fairly
clear
that
this
program
is
beneficial
to
the
industry.
indeed,
it
seems
likely
that
if
the
commission
did
not
conduct
a
program
of
this
kind,
the
industry
as
a
whole
or
the
various
members
of
the
industry
would
have
to
conduct
similar
programs
themselves.
and
as
i
read
their
brief,
the
new
england
power
co.
in
this
case
does
not
even
contend
that
this
program
is
not
beneficial.
their
contention
instead
is
that
the
fee
is
invalid
because
the
program
is
conducted
primarily
in
the
public
interest,
for
the
public
benefit.
but
as
mr.
korman
indicated
in
the
preceding
case,
the
implication
of
this
argument
is
simply
to
read
title
v
out
of
the
united
states
code.
every
regulatory
program
is
supposed
to
be
conducted
primarily
for
the
public
benefit.
in
enacting
title
v,
congress
understood
that
it
was
conferring
authority
to
impose
fees
for
a
wide
range
of
regulatory
services
and
activities
required
by
law
to
be
conducted
primarily
in
the
public
benefit.
we
see
no
incompatibility
between
the
commission’s
authority
to
impose
fees
and
its
responsibility
for
regulating
it
in
the
public
interest.
and
this
leaves
for
discussion
the
two
industry-wide
fees
imposed
to
cover
the
cost
of
rate
setting
activities
or
the
residual
cost
of
such
activities.
we
feel
that,
as
to
each
individual
company
whose
rates
are
reviewed
and
approved
by
the
commission,
there
is
a
direct
benefit
conferred.
the
approval
of
a
new
rate
schedule
is
analogous
to
the
issuance
of
a
license
for
the
conduct
of
business.
that
is,
the
company
could
not
continue
its
business
at
the
higher
rate
schedule
unless
it
receives
the
approval
of
the
commission.
the
respondents,
however,
seem
to
make
the
general
argument
that
this
kind
of
benefit
is
really
no
benefit
at
all.
they
say
that
they’d
be
better
off
with
no
rate
regulation.
we
feel
that
that’s
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
in
the
first
place,
the
merits
of
that
argument
are
far
from
clear.
these
companies
are
insulated
from
destructive
competition
by
the
regulation
of
the
commission.
the
numbers
of
pipeline
companies
and
electric
utilities
are
regulated
by
the
commission,
and
the
kind
of
competition
that
might
otherwise
exist
has
been
weeded
out.
but
whether
or
not
regulation,
as
such,
benefits
the
industries
and
economists
might
well
differ
at
that
point,
we
feel
that,
that
as
such
is
not
the
issue
here.
title
v,
when
it
speaks
in
terms
of
a
benefit,
speaks
in
terms
of
a
benefit
conferred
within
the
context
of
a
preexisting
regulatory
scheme.
even
the
budget
circular
which
talks
in
terms
of
a
special
benefit
recognizes
this
because
it
gives
us
examples
of
regulatory
activities:
the
issuance
of
licenses,
of
certificates
of
convenience
and
necessity,
inspections,
all
of
which
would
be
unnecessary
without
regulation.
these
are
all
benefits
which
are
conferred
only
within
the
context
of
a
preexisting
regulatory
scheme.
unlike
the
issuance
of
a
license,
the
approval
of
a
rate
schedule
does
confer
a
benefit
within
this
context.
indeed,
even
the
electric
utility
companies
have
recognized
this
because
they
raise
no
objection
to
the
sliding
scale
fee
which
is
substantial
that
the
commission
now
imposes
on
the
filing
of
new
rate
schedules.
this
leaves
only
the
contention
of
the
respondents
that
it’s
unfair
to
impose
a
fee
for
rate
setting
activities
on
a
company
who
doesn’t
file
a
new
rate
schedule
during
the
year.
i
would
first
point
out
about
this
contention
that
it
does
not
go
to
the
commission’s
authority
to
impose
a
fee
to
recapture
the
entire
amount
of
rate
setting
activities.
that
contention
only
goes
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
method
that
the
commission
has
employed
for
allocating
this
fee.
and
as
we
understand
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
did
not
purport
to
reach
questions
of
reasonableness,
that
issue
is
not
one
which
is
before
the
court
in
this
case.
but
we,
nevertheless,
feel
that
the
allocation
chosen
by
the
commission
is
reasonable.
the
--
each
particular
company,
whether
or
not
files
a
rate
schedule
during
a
given
year,
is
going
to
file
a
rate
schedules
from
time
to
time
in
the
long
run.
and
therefore,
it
benefits
from
having
the
commission
services
available
and
also
especially
benefits
whenever
its
rate
schedule
is
considered
and
approved.
and
it
seems
to
us,
not
unreasonable
to
allocate
this
fee
on
an
annual
basis
over
time
rather
than
on
a
filing
basis.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
just
like
to
clarify
a
few
matters
of
fact.
the
natural
gas
companies
here
contended
that
the
regulation
of
producer
sales
is
of
benefit
to
producers
and
not
to
the
pipeline
companies.
and
we
would
point
out
that
the
producers
are
entitled
to
sell
in
intrastate
commerce
without
any
permission
in
the
commission
whatsoever.
they
do
not
need
a
producer
certificate
to
sell.
the
pipeline
companies,
however,
do
need
the
issuance
of
such
a
certificate
before
they
can
acquire
any
supplies
of
domestic
natural
gas
for
the
introduction
of
that
gas
in
their
business
of
transporting
in
interstate
commerce.
secondly,
the
electric
utility
company
here
contends
that
there
are
some
electric
utility
companies
subject
to
the
regulation
of
the
commission
which
do
not
file
rate
schedules.
we
are
not
aware
of
any
such
companies.
it’s
our
understanding
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
which
runs
to
the
sales
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce
would
require
the
filing
of
rate
schedules
with
respect
to
such
sales.
however,
even
assuming
that
there
might
be
from
time
to
time
a
company
for
some
reason
which
did
not
file
a
rate
schedule,
nevertheless
the
validity
of
this
fee
would
be
a
matter
of
--
or
the
application
of
this
fee
to
that
company
would
be
a
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
allocation
of
the
fee.
that
does
not
go
to
the
commission’s
authority
under
title
v
to
impose
a
fee
covering
the
cost
of
rate
setting
activities.
third,
the
electric
utility
company
also
suggests
that,
contrary
to
my
statement
in
earlier
argument,
the
commission
does
not
insulate
them
from
competition
in
any
way.
but
to
the
contrary,
this
court
held
last
term
in
the
gold
states
case
that
the
commission
must
consider
the
competitive
consequences
of
any
activity
subject
to
its
regulation
and
it
must
act
in
accordance
with
what
is
necessary
from
a
competitive
point
of
view,
and
in
imposing
anti-competitive
activity
by
certain
of
the
utilities.
and
fourth,
once
again,
the
electric
utility
company
challenges
the
commission’s
assertion
that
the
coordination
and
reliability
program
is
of
benefit
to
the
utilities.
and
i
would
simply
point
out
in
this
connection
that
this
court
in
the
gainesville
utilities
case
acknowledged
that
the
interconnection
which
is
ordered
by
the
commission
in
connection
with
this
program
was
of
signal
benefit
to
the
electric
utility
companies
because
it
permitted
them
to
draw
upon
the
power
sources
of
other
companies
in
times
of
need
and
save
them
from
the
major
expense
of
constructing
adequate
generating
facilities
to
cover
all
of
their
hypothetical
needs.
and
last,
once
again
the
contention
is
made
that
title
v
itself
extends
no
authority
whatsoever
to
the
federal
power
commission.
but
the
new
england
power
company,
in
making
this
assertion,
is
in
fact
being
inconsistent
because
they
themselves
acknowledge
that
the
federal
power
commission
does
have
authority
under
title
v
to
assess
fees
for
the
filing
of
new
rate
schedules.
title
v
is
the
only
origin
of
that
authority
exercised
by
the
commission.
we
feel
that
the
question
here
is
not
whether
the
commission
has
authority
or
whether
that
authority
extends
to
the
fees
here
and
we
believe
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
stated
that
it
does.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i’m
finished.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
the
government’s
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
issue
is
whether
the
federal
power
commission
under
title
v
of
the
independent
officers
appropriations
act
of
1952
which
we
have
been
discussing,
whether
the
federal
power
commission
is
authorized
under
that
act
to
impose
annual
fees
upon
the
electric
energy
and
natural
gas
companies
for
the
purpose
of
partially
deferring
the
cost
of
regulating
those
industries.
this
issue
is,
of
course,
closely
similar
to
the
one
discussed
in
the
preceding
case.
but
the
application
of
title
v
in
any
given
case
depends
on
a
large
part
upon
the
nature
of
the
government
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
one
of
the
issues
is
identical,
mr.
justice
douglas.
that’s
correct.
but
as
i
was
saying,
the
application
of
title
v
in
any
given
case
also
depends
upon
the
nature
of
the
governmental
activities
in
question.
for
that
reason,
i
will
discuss
at
the
outset
how
the
particular
activities
of
the
federal
power
commission
for
which
the
fees
here
have
been
assessed.
the
power
commission
has
authority
to
regulate
two
industries,
electric
energy
and
natural
gas
industries.
in
connection
with
its
regulation
of
the
natural
gas
industry,
at
issue
here
are
certain
annual
fees
which
the
commission
has
imposed
in
connection
with
its
regulation
of
the
sale
of
natural
gas.
there
are
two
types
of
sales
in
question.
one,
from
producers
to
pipeline
companies,
and
the
second
is
resale
by
pipeline
companies
in
interstate
commerce.
in
regulating
producer
sales,
the
commission
reviews
the
contracts
between
the
producer
and
the
pipeline
company
for
delivery
of
natural
gas
at
the
wellhead.
the
delivery
of
natural
gas
at
the
wellhead
cannot
commence
until
the
commission
approves
the
contract
as
to
amount,
price,
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
sale.
the
approval
of
the
contract
takes
the
form
of
what
is
called
the
issuance
of
a
producer
certificate.
this
certificate
permits
the
pipeline
company
to
take
delivery
of
the
natural
gas
at
the
wellhead
and
to
begin
transporting
it
in
interstate
commerce.
instead
of
imposing
a
fee
for
the
issuance
of
each
particular
certificate,
the
commission
has
determined
to
impose
an
annual
fee
on
each
pipeline
company
based
upon
the
amounts
of
natural
gas
reserves
certified
for
delivery
to
that
company
in
connection
with
the
producer
certificate
program
during
the
year.
and
this
so-called
added
reserve
fee
is
the
first
of
the
fees
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
commission
is
also
responsible
for
regulating
the
sales
of
the
pipeline
companies,
as
i
have
indicated.
the
review
of
the
sales
by
the
pipeline
companies
takes
the
form
of
review
and
approval
of
pipeline
rate
schedules.
and
this
review
procedure
is
invoked
normally
by
the
filing
by
a
pipeline
company
of
a
new
rate
schedule.
ordinarily
or
at
least
frequently,
the
commission
permits
a
new
rate
schedule
to
go
into
effect
without
holding
rate
setting
hearings.
but
when
hearings
are
held,
as
is
frequently
the
case,
they
can
be
time
consuming,
expensive,
and
quite
complicated.
as
a
consequence,
the
rate
setting
proceeding,
pertaining
to
any
particular
filing
of
a
new
rate
schedule,
may
bear
a
little
direct
relationship
to
the
dollar
amount
of
the
rate
increase
which
is
being
sought.
for
that
reason,
the
commission
has
determined
that
it’s
more
equitable
to
impose
a
fee
not
on
the
basis
of
each
particular
rate
increase
filing,
but
rather
in
the
form
of
an
annual
fee
imposed
upon
all
pipeline
companies
on
the
basis
of
annual
sales.
that
is
the
second
fee
at
issue
in
this
case.
and
those
are
the
two
pipeline
company
fees
in
question
here.
the
commission
also
regulates
the
electric
energy
companies.
and
its
regulation
of
those
companies
is
similar
in
basic
outline
to
the
regulation
of
the
natural
gas
industry.
the
commission
has
responsibility
for
regulating
the
transmission
of
electric
energy
in
interstate
commerce,
and
the
sale
of
that
energy
for
resale.
in
carrying
out
this
responsibility,
it
conducts
what
is
called
a
coordination
and
reliability
program.
this
program
consists
of
a
region-by-region
monitoring
of
the
adequacy
of
electric
transmission
and
generating
facilities
in
connect
--
in
relation
to
the
growing
demand
for
electric
energy
and
the
shifting
pattern
of
its
use
from
season
to
season
and
from
day
time
and
night
time.
in
connection
with
this
program,
the
commission
is
authorized
to
direct
electric
utility
companies
to
interconnect
their
transmission
facilities,
one
with
the
other.
these
interconnections
minimize
the
likelihood
of
blackouts
and
brownouts
and
permit
the
electric
utility
companies
to
share
their
generating
facilities
in
effect,
rather
than
relying
entirely
upon
their
own
generating
facilities.
since
this
coordination
and
reliability
program
is
conducted
on
an
industry-wide
basis
and
not
at
the
instance
of
any
particular
company,
the
commission
is
determined
that
the
only
fair
and
practical
means
of
allocating
the
cost
of
the
program
is
through
an
industry-wide
assessment.
and
that
assessment
is
the
third
of
the
fees
at
issue
here.
the
commission
also
regulates
the
rates
charged
by
electric
utility
companies
in
their
sale
of
electric
energy
for
resale.
the
electric
utility
companies
file
new
rate
schedules
and
the
commission
has
imposed
a
sliding
scale
fee
for
the
filing
of
a
right
schedule,
and
it’s
anticipated
that
the
sliding
scale
fee
will
cover
the
major
portion
of
the
cost
of
the
commission’s
electric
utility
rate
setting
activities.
but
since
those
activities
or
the
cost
of
those
activities
cannot
be
known
until
the
end
of
the
year
for
any
given
year
and
also
because
the
commission
undertakes
certain
incidental
regulatory
activities
for
which
there’s
no
set
fee,
it
is
anticipated
that
the
sliding
scale
fees
will
not
cover
the
full
pertinent
regulatory
cost
here.
for
that
reason,
the
commission
has
also
imposed
an
annual
fee
on
the
electric
utility
companies
to
cover
the
residual
cost
of
rate
setting
and
other
incidental
costs.
to
recapitulate,
there
are
four
fees
here
at
issue.
the
added
reserve
fee
on
the
pipeline
companies
in
connection
with
the
producer
certificate
program,
the
fee
on
the
pipeline
companies
to
cover
the
cost
of
rate
setting
activities,
the
fee
on
the
electric
utility
companies
to
cover
the
cost
of
the
coordination
and
reliability
program,
and
finally
the
fee
on
the
electric
utility
companies
to
cover
certain
residual
and
incidental
costs.
the
court
of
appeals
held
all
four
fees
to
be
invalid.
the
court
determined
that
a
fee
is
justified
under
title
v
only
if
it
is
in
return
for
the
conferral
of
a
special
benefit.
and
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
not
special
benefit
conferred
on
the
two
industries
here
in
question.
the
court
went
on
to
add
that,
in
its
view,
the
imposition
of
fees
of
this
kind
was
somehow
inconsistent
with
the
commission’s
responsibility
for
regulating
in
a
public
interest.
i
will
now
turn
to
the
legal
issues
which
are
raised
by
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
frankly,
i
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
have
assumed
that
such
industry-wide
fees
of
this
kind
have
not
been
imposed
by
the
other
regulatory
commissions
as
of
yet.
but
i
can’t
say
that
with
any
certainty.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
my
impression.
that’s
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it
may
be
that
other
agencies
have
recently
imposed
such
fees
or
are
giving
serious
consideration
to
doing
so.
but,
so
far
as
i
know,
there
are
no
other
annual
fees
of
this
kind.
but,
again,
i
say
that
i’m
not
positive.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
before
turning
to
a
discussion
of
the
kinds
of
issues
that
were
discussed
under
title
v
in
the
previous
case.
it’s
necessary,
i
think,
to
deal
with
what
properly
considered
is
probably
peripheral
issue
here.
but
title
v,
when
it
authorized
the
imposition
of
certain
fees,
included
a
proviso
which
stated
that
no
statute
prohibiting
the
collection
or
imposition
of
any
fee
was
thereby
repealed.
the
new
england
power
co.
here
has
seized
upon
that
proviso
and
contended
that
the
federal
power
commission
drives
no
authority
at
all
under
title
v.
i
think
it’s
necessary
to
turn
our
attention
to
that
only
briefly.
the
company’s
argument
is
that
since
the
federal
power
act
itself
did
not
authorize
the
imposition
of
fees
of
this
kind.
therefore,
that
must
be
taken
to
be
an
implicit
prohibition
on
the
imposition
of
fees
and,
therefore,
that
the
proviso
prohibits
the
federal
power
commission
from
imposing
any
fees.
but
the
title
v
proviso,
by
its
very
terms,
was
intended
only
to
ensure
that
the
statute
would
not
be
construed
as
repealing
any
expressed
prohibition
that
was
already
on
the
books.
the
house
report
accompanying
title
v
described
it
“as
providing
authority
for
government
agencies
to
make
charges
for
services
and
cases
where
no
charge
is
made
at
present.”
the
basic
purpose
of
title
v
was
to
confer
authority
where
none
previously
existed.
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
clear
beyond
any
serious
question,
that
the
commission
does
have
authority
under
title
v
to
impose
fees.
an
issue
posed
by
this
case
is
whether
that
authority
extends
to
the
particular
fees
in
question.
title
v
speaks
in
terms
of
work
performed,
services
or
benefits
provided,
or
privileges
granted
to
or
for
any
person,
including
groups.
now
one
of
the
major
points
of
contention
in
these
cases
is
whether
the
statutory
phrase
“any
person,
including
groups”
can
in
an
appropriate
case
be
applied
to
an
industry
as
an
entity.
it
seems
obvious
to
us
that
that
statutory
phrase
does
embrace
the
companies
that
comprise
a
single
industry.
an
industry
consists
of
a
group
of
companies
and
groups
are
covered
by
the
explicit
language
of
the
statute.
moreover
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
in
our
brief,
it’s
on
pages
2
and
3.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
right.
it
says
to
or
for
any
person
(including
groups,
associations,
organization,
etcetera),
reading
on
the
bottom
page
of
page
2.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well
there,
i
suppose,
would
be
two
parallel
arguments.
one
is
that
coal
industry
can
be
a
person.
secondly,
that
when
each
member
of
an
industry
has
work
performed
on
its
behalf,
then
a
fee
as
to
each
member
is
appropriate
and,
therefore,
a
fee
as
to
all
members
is
appropriate.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
definition
or
an
elaboration
of
the
meaning.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
as
i
say,
the
fee
of
course
is
not
imposed
on
the
industry
qua-industry.
it’s
imposed
on
each
of
the
separate
members
of
the
industry.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
clearly,
each
company
is
a
person,
so
that
in
that
sense,
a
fee
as
to
each
member
of
the
industry
would
clearly
seems
to
be
authorized
under
title
v.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
question
would
be,
i
suppose,
whether
the
word
“performed--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
--
for
the
industry”
is
for
each
member
of
the
industry.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
think
i
understand
you
and
i
think
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
but,
i’m
not
fully
sure.[attempt
to
laughter]
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
i
think
the
question
is
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
as
it
arises
in
this
case,
is
whether
an
industry-wide
benefit,
that
is
a
benefit
or
work
performed
for
the
whole
industry
indivisibly,
nevertheless
is
a
benefit
to
or
for
the
constituent
members
of
that
industry
for
purposes
of
title
v.
and
our
position
is
that
the
bare
language
of
the
statute
certainly
permits
that
construction
and,
furthermore,
that
there
is
certainly
no
policy
reason
why
an
agency
which
confers
a
benefit
on
an
industry
as
a
group
should
not
be
able
to
assess
a
properly
allocated
fee
as
to
each
member
of
that
industry.
that,
at
any
rate,
is
our
contention
with
respect
to
this
aspect
of
title
v.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
we
could
make
a
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
we
could
make
a
survey
of
that
kind
and
let
you
know.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
we
will
be
happy
to
do
that
and
supply
the
court
with
an
admission.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
think
the
answer
to
that
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
the
origin
of
the
fees
in
these
two
cases
is
fairly
clear
from
the
statement
of
the
facts
in
the
respective
briefs.
the
relevant
appropriations
committees
of
the
congress
have
been
urging
that
these
two
commissions
certainly,
for
some
time
in
the
past,
to
impose
fees
of
this
kind.
and
it’s
in
response
to
the
congress’
suggestion
that
these
fees
have
been
imposed.
for
that
reason,
i
doubt
that
there’s
been
a
coordination
of
policy
by
all
the
independent
agencies.
i
think
that
these
two
agencies
are
moving
in
response
to
perceived
congressional
demands.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
right.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
right.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it’s
been
a
discretionary
authority
which,
at
least
by
these
two
agencies,
has
not
been
exercised
in
this
manner
in
the
past.
the
federal
power
commission
did
impose
fees
upon
the
certification
of
--
excuse
me,
on
the
issue
in
certificates
in
public
convenience
and
necessity
several
years
ago
and
that
was
the
exercise
of
authority
under
title
v.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it
certainly
imposes
a
user
fee,
that’s
correct.
the
respondents’
contention
about
the
fee
not
being
applicable
to
industries
on
account
of
industry-wide
benefits
is
based
upon
a
budget
circular
a-25
which
was
discussed
in
the
preceding
case.
we
would
simply
point
out
here
that
that
budget
circular
does
not
require
the
kind
of
restrictive
reading
which
the
power
company
and
the
natural
gas
companies
would
give
it.
that
does
speak
in
terms
of
measurable
unit
of
service
to
identifiable
recipients.
but
again,
if
an
industry
as
such
would
identify
a
recipient
of
a
benefit,
then
nothing
in
the
budge
circular
by
its
terms
would
prohibit
the
assessment
of
an
industry-wide
fee.
furthermore,
as
my
colleague
mr.
korman
pointed
out
in
the
preceding
case,
that
budget
circular
does
not
apply
to
independent
agencies.
it
merely
sets
forth
a
general
fee
setting
policy
for
the
executive
branch
agencies.
turning
now
to
the
question
of
whether
the
commission,
in
performing
the
regulatory
activities
here
in
question,
performs
work,
provides
a
service
or
a
benefit,
or
grants
a
privilege
to
or
for
the
companies
in
these
industries;
this
is
a
question
which
must
be
considered,
i
think,
on
a
fee-by-fee
basis.
i
turn,
first,
therefore
to
the
added
reserve
fee
which
the
commission
has
imposed
upon
the
pipeline
companies
in
connection
with
the
producer
certificate
program.
that
fee,
it
should
be
pointed
out
at
the
outset,
is
not
an
industry-wide
fee.
that
is,
it’s
not
a
fee
which
is
assessed
in
amount
and
then
arbitrarily
allocated
among
the
constituent
members
of
the
industry.
it’s
a
fee
which
is
imposed
only
on
those
pipeline
companies
for
which
new
reserves
have
been
certified
for
delivery
under
the
producer
certificate
program
during
that
year.
the
certification
of
the
contract
for
the
delivery
of
reserves
at
that
kind
is
analogous
in
purpose
and
effect
to
a
license
for
the
conduct
of
additional
business.
and
it’s
clearly
of
benefit
to
the
company
because
it
thereby
secures
additional
supplies
which
would
not
otherwise
be
available
to
it.
and,
this
added
reserve
fee,
which
is
imposed,
is
imposed
in
a
manner
directly
proportional
to
the
amount
of
reserves
which
have
been
certified
to
that
company
for
the
year.
therefore,
it’s
proportional
to
the
benefit
actually
received
by
the
company
in
connection
with
the
producer
certificate
program.
because
of
this,
we
believe
that
no
matter
how
this
court
decides
the
other
issues
in
the
case,
the
added
reserve
fees
is
clearly
valid
under
title
v.
now,
the
other
fees
at
issue
here
are
imposed
on
an
industry-wide
basis.
that
is,
the
full
amount
of
the
fee
is
first
determined
and
then
it’s
allocated
among
the
various
members
of
the
industry.
the
fee
imposed
upon
the
electric
utility
companies
to
pay
for
the
cost
of
the
coordination
and
reliability
program
relates
to
beneficial
service
which
is
provided
to
the
entire
industry
as
a
whole.
in
conducting
the
coordination
and
reliability
program,
the
commission
comprehensively
studies
the
growing
market
for
electric
energy
and
it
also
studies
the
ability
of
the
existing
generating
and
transmission
facilities
to
meet
the
needs
of
that
market.
this
study
assists
the
companies
in
planning
their
capital
budgeting
and
it
facilitates
their
interconnection
and
cooperation
with
other
electric
energy
companies.
as
a
consequence,
they
save
money.
they
don’t
have
to
invest
in
generating
facilities
to
the
extent
that
they
otherwise
would
and
moreover,
the
delivery
of
electric
energy
becomes
more
reliable,
the
incidence
of
blackouts
and
brownouts
is
reduced.
and
this
increased
reliability
of
the
electric
energy
transmitted
by
the
companies
enhances
the
competitiveness
of
the
companies
vis-à-vis
other
fuel
suppliers.
because
of
this,
it
seems
fairly
clear
that
this
program
is
beneficial
to
the
industry.
indeed,
it
seems
likely
that
if
the
commission
did
not
conduct
a
program
of
this
kind,
the
industry
as
a
whole
or
the
various
members
of
the
industry
would
have
to
conduct
similar
programs
themselves.
and
as
i
read
their
brief,
the
new
england
power
co.
in
this
case
does
not
even
contend
that
this
program
is
not
beneficial.
their
contention
instead
is
that
the
fee
is
invalid
because
the
program
is
conducted
primarily
in
the
public
interest,
for
the
public
benefit.
but
as
mr.
korman
indicated
in
the
preceding
case,
the
implication
of
this
argument
is
simply
to
read
title
v
out
of
the
united
states
code.
every
regulatory
program
is
supposed
to
be
conducted
primarily
for
the
public
benefit.
in
enacting
title
v,
congress
understood
that
it
was
conferring
authority
to
impose
fees
for
a
wide
range
of
regulatory
services
and
activities
required
by
law
to
be
conducted
primarily
in
the
public
benefit.
we
see
no
incompatibility
between
the
commission’s
authority
to
impose
fees
and
its
responsibility
for
regulating
it
in
the
public
interest.
and
this
leaves
for
discussion
the
two
industry-wide
fees
imposed
to
cover
the
cost
of
rate
setting
activities
or
the
residual
cost
of
such
activities.
we
feel
that,
as
to
each
individual
company
whose
rates
are
reviewed
and
approved
by
the
commission,
there
is
a
direct
benefit
conferred.
the
approval
of
a
new
rate
schedule
is
analogous
to
the
issuance
of
a
license
for
the
conduct
of
business.
that
is,
the
company
could
not
continue
its
business
at
the
higher
rate
schedule
unless
it
receives
the
approval
of
the
commission.
the
respondents,
however,
seem
to
make
the
general
argument
that
this
kind
of
benefit
is
really
no
benefit
at
all.
they
say
that
they’d
be
better
off
with
no
rate
regulation.
we
feel
that
that’s
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
in
the
first
place,
the
merits
of
that
argument
are
far
from
clear.
these
companies
are
insulated
from
destructive
competition
by
the
regulation
of
the
commission.
the
numbers
of
pipeline
companies
and
electric
utilities
are
regulated
by
the
commission,
and
the
kind
of
competition
that
might
otherwise
exist
has
been
weeded
out.
but
whether
or
not
regulation,
as
such,
benefits
the
industries
and
economists
might
well
differ
at
that
point,
we
feel
that,
that
as
such
is
not
the
issue
here.
title
v,
when
it
speaks
in
terms
of
a
benefit,
speaks
in
terms
of
a
benefit
conferred
within
the
context
of
a
preexisting
regulatory
scheme.
even
the
budget
circular
which
talks
in
terms
of
a
special
benefit
recognizes
this
because
it
gives
us
examples
of
regulatory
activities:
the
issuance
of
licenses,
of
certificates
of
convenience
and
necessity,
inspections,
all
of
which
would
be
unnecessary
without
regulation.
these
are
all
benefits
which
are
conferred
only
within
the
context
of
a
preexisting
regulatory
scheme.
unlike
the
issuance
of
a
license,
the
approval
of
a
rate
schedule
does
confer
a
benefit
within
this
context.
indeed,
even
the
electric
utility
companies
have
recognized
this
because
they
raise
no
objection
to
the
sliding
scale
fee
which
is
substantial
that
the
commission
now
imposes
on
the
filing
of
new
rate
schedules.
this
leaves
only
the
contention
of
the
respondents
that
it’s
unfair
to
impose
a
fee
for
rate
setting
activities
on
a
company
who
doesn’t
file
a
new
rate
schedule
during
the
year.
i
would
first
point
out
about
this
contention
that
it
does
not
go
to
the
commission’s
authority
to
impose
a
fee
to
recapture
the
entire
amount
of
rate
setting
activities.
that
contention
only
goes
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
method
that
the
commission
has
employed
for
allocating
this
fee.
and
as
we
understand
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals,
which
did
not
purport
to
reach
questions
of
reasonableness,
that
issue
is
not
one
which
is
before
the
court
in
this
case.
but
we,
nevertheless,
feel
that
the
allocation
chosen
by
the
commission
is
reasonable.
the
--
each
particular
company,
whether
or
not
files
a
rate
schedule
during
a
given
year,
is
going
to
file
a
rate
schedules
from
time
to
time
in
the
long
run.
and
therefore,
it
benefits
from
having
the
commission
services
available
and
also
especially
benefits
whenever
its
rate
schedule
is
considered
and
approved.
and
it
seems
to
us,
not
unreasonable
to
allocate
this
fee
on
an
annual
basis
over
time
rather
than
on
a
filing
basis.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
just
like
to
clarify
a
few
matters
of
fact.
the
natural
gas
companies
here
contended
that
the
regulation
of
producer
sales
is
of
benefit
to
producers
and
not
to
the
pipeline
companies.
and
we
would
point
out
that
the
producers
are
entitled
to
sell
in
intrastate
commerce
without
any
permission
in
the
commission
whatsoever.
they
do
not
need
a
producer
certificate
to
sell.
the
pipeline
companies,
however,
do
need
the
issuance
of
such
a
certificate
before
they
can
acquire
any
supplies
of
domestic
natural
gas
for
the
introduction
of
that
gas
in
their
business
of
transporting
in
interstate
commerce.
secondly,
the
electric
utility
company
here
contends
that
there
are
some
electric
utility
companies
subject
to
the
regulation
of
the
commission
which
do
not
file
rate
schedules.
we
are
not
aware
of
any
such
companies.
it’s
our
understanding
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
commission
which
runs
to
the
sales
for
resale
in
interstate
commerce
would
require
the
filing
of
rate
schedules
with
respect
to
such
sales.
however,
even
assuming
that
there
might
be
from
time
to
time
a
company
for
some
reason
which
did
not
file
a
rate
schedule,
nevertheless
the
validity
of
this
fee
would
be
a
matter
of
--
or
the
application
of
this
fee
to
that
company
would
be
a
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
allocation
of
the
fee.
that
does
not
go
to
the
commission’s
authority
under
title
v
to
impose
a
fee
covering
the
cost
of
rate
setting
activities.
third,
the
electric
utility
company
also
suggests
that,
contrary
to
my
statement
in
earlier
argument,
the
commission
does
not
insulate
them
from
competition
in
any
way.
but
to
the
contrary,
this
court
held
last
term
in
the
gold
states
case
that
the
commission
must
consider
the
competitive
consequences
of
any
activity
subject
to
its
regulation
and
it
must
act
in
accordance
with
what
is
necessary
from
a
competitive
point
of
view,
and
in
imposing
anti-competitive
activity
by
certain
of
the
utilities.
and
fourth,
once
again,
the
electric
utility
company
challenges
the
commission’s
assertion
that
the
coordination
and
reliability
program
is
of
benefit
to
the
utilities.
and
i
would
simply
point
out
in
this
connection
that
this
court
in
the
gainesville
utilities
case
acknowledged
that
the
interconnection
which
is
ordered
by
the
commission
in
connection
with
this
program
was
of
signal
benefit
to
the
electric
utility
companies
because
it
permitted
them
to
draw
upon
the
power
sources
of
other
companies
in
times
of
need
and
save
them
from
the
major
expense
of
constructing
adequate
generating
facilities
to
cover
all
of
their
hypothetical
needs.
and
last,
once
again
the
contention
is
made
that
title
v
itself
extends
no
authority
whatsoever
to
the
federal
power
commission.
but
the
new
england
power
company,
in
making
this
assertion,
is
in
fact
being
inconsistent
because
they
themselves
acknowledge
that
the
federal
power
commission
does
have
authority
under
title
v
to
assess
fees
for
the
filing
of
new
rate
schedules.
title
v
is
the
only
origin
of
that
authority
exercised
by
the
commission.
we
feel
that
the
question
here
is
not
whether
the
commission
has
authority
or
whether
that
authority
extends
to
the
fees
here
and
we
believe
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
stated
that
it
does.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i’m
finished.
