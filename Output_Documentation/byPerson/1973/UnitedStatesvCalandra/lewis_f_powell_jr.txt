justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
respondent
in
number
72-734
was
called
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury
investigating
the
loansharking
activities.
his
place
of
business
had
previously
been
searched
under
a
warrant,
directed
solely
to
an
evidence
in
bookmaking
activities.
in
that
search,
evidence
as
to
loansharking
was
seized.
the
warrant
was
not
broad
enough
to
encompass
such
evidence
and
accordingly
its
seizure
was
unlawful.
on
respondent's
motion
the
district
court
ordered
suppression
of
this
evidence.
it
further
held
that
respondent
need
not
answer
any
of
the
grand
jury's
questions
based
on
the
suppressed
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed.
the
case
is
here
on
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari.
the
exclusionary
rule,
a
judicially
created
remedy
designed
to
safeguard
fourth
amendment
rights
is
applicable
in
criminal
trials
to
suppress
illegally
seized
evidence
and
the
fruits
thereof.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
applies
also
to
a
grand
jury
investigation.
we
hold
that
it
does
not.
the
rule
does
not
proscribe
the
use
of
illegally
seized
evidence,
in
all
proceedings
or
against
persons.
its
application
has
been
restricted
to
those
areas
where
its
remedial
objectives
are
thought
most
efficaciously
served.
extending
the
rule
to
grand
jury
investigations
would
at
most
achieve
only
a
speculative
advance
in
the
deterrence
of
police
misconduct.
more
importantly
such
an
extension
would
unduly
interfere
with
the
effective
and
expeditious
discharge
of
the
grand
jury's
duties.
the
public
has
a
substantial
interest
in
preserving
the
historic
role
and
functions
of
the
grand
jury,
without
burdening
it
with
what
this
court
has
described
in
a
recent
case
as
mini
trials.
it
is
to
be
remembered
of
course
that
a
witness
called
by
the
grand
jury
may
protect
his
own
position
by
invoking
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self
incrimination.
indeed
in
this
case,
respondent
had
been
offered
transactional
immunity.
mr,
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
douglas
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
joined.
