mr.
roger
f.
day
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
we
agree
that
there
was
a
point
in
time
where
the
immunity
provided
by
the
constitution
will
preclude
a
state
or
locality
from
the
levying
of
tax
upon
it.
the
question
is
simply
when
that
that
time
and
if
that
time
has
arrived
in
this
case.
i
will
not
dwell
on
the
facts
of
this
case
because
they're
entirely
not
disputed.
there
is
no
controversy
or
whatever
i
think
between
the
state
and
the
company
over
the
facts.
but
i
would
like
to
spend
a
few
moments
in
addressing
myself
to
the
question,
why
should
physical
motion
be
required
to
be
shown
before
the
immunity
provided
by
the
export
clause
attaches?
it’s
our
position
that
in
this
case,
there
is
no
need
whatsoever
for
showing
physical
motion
before
immunity
does
attach.
why
not?
simply
because
the
physical
character
of
the
goods
in
question
demonstrates
conclusively
that
the
goods
can’t
go
any
place
else
but
overseas.
these
machines
are
unique,
they
were
built
pursuant
to
foreign
orders,
they
were
constructed
to
serve
foreign
customers,
they
can’t
be
used
in
the
united
states,
so
when
these
machines
have
moved
to
the
ncr
warehouse,
have
been
packaged
and
crated
and
are
stamped
of
their
exportation
destination
placed
upon
them,
they
are
at
that
moment
exports
in
every
real
sense
just
as
much
as
the
next
day
when
they
are
loaded
aboard
the
carrier.
now
the
state
--
mr.
roger
f.
day
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
true.
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
there
are
some
instances
where
this
has
occurred.
those
instances
are
not
the
everyday
occurrence.
i
want
to
make
that
clear.
there
is
certainly
no
incentive
for
national
cash
register
to
keep
its
goods
stored
in
the
warehouse.
the
sooner
they
can
move
them
out,
the
sooner
they
can
get
paid.
these
instances
that
have
occurred
like
that
have
occurred
not
because
of
ncr’s
desire
but
solely
because
of
problems
with
the
foreign
license
problem,
the
foreign
exchange
problem
that
prevents
them
from
sending
them.
mr.
roger
f.
day
these
goods
that
are
in
question
are
not
in
movement
as
of
tax
day.
they
are
in
the
warehouse
of
ncr.
mr.
roger
f.
day
they
are
there
for
about
three
reasons,
your
honor.
the
shipments
that
are
made
are
made
of
an
order.
and
this
order
maybe
composed
--
mr.
roger
f.
day
well,
that
maybe
one
reason
your
honor,
yes.
another
reason
is
we
have
--
mr.
roger
f.
day
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
the
other
reasons
are
these.
the
goods
are
not
--
these
machines
are
not
all
produced
at
one
time.
they
are
produced
day
by
day
so
they
have
to
be
collected
until
the
entire
order
is
ready
for
shipment.
that’s
another
reason.
another
reason
is
--
mr.
roger
f.
day
i’m
sorry?
i
didn’t
understand
your
question.
mr.
roger
f.
day
on
some
occasions,
yes.
they
will
be
sent
on
open
account
on
some
instances.
on
some
instances,
they
will
be
sent
on
letters
of
credit
--
mr.
roger
f.
day
i
think
that’s
probably
true
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
roger
f.
day
that
is
absolutely
correct.
we
do
not
contest
that
one
bit.
mr.
roger
f.
day
the
question
to
which
i
want
to
address
myself
is
why
should
motion
be
required?
now
the
state
i’m
sure
would
concede
--
mr.
roger
f.
day
it
differs
in
this
respect,
your
honor.
they
were
dealing
there
with
logs.
logs
is
a
commodity
that
has
a
domestic
use
equal
to
a
foreign
use.
in
short,
logs
can
be
used
anywhere
to
make
lumber.
and
now
in
that
instance
like
joy
oil
which
involved
gasoline,
and
like
the
other
cases
which
involves
goods
of
that
type,
there
is
no
way
on
tax
listing
date
that
you
can
say
for
sure
that
those
products
or
those
goods
are
going
to
go
abroad
unless
they
have
been
evidenced
to
be
in
motion.
mr.
roger
f.
day
fungibility
is
one
word
that
can
be
used,
yes.
i
think
more
accurately,
whether
or
not
the
goods
have
a
domestic
use.
whether
they
are
fungible
or
not
is
a
crucial
inquire.
mr.
roger
f.
day
it
was
not
fungible,
your
honor
and
that’s
why
i
alluded
to
the
domestic
use.
the
empresa
case
dealt
with
what
was
termed
as
cement
plant.
that
was
only
a
convenient
term
of
reference.
as
a
cement
plant,
it
involved
a
whole
host
of
things,
machinery
and
equipments,
supplies,
parts
and
a
cement
plant
which
was
in
process
of
being
dismantled.
as
of
tax
listing
day,
i
think
the
record
in
that
case
revealed
that
about
10%
of
it
had
been
shipped.
i
don’t
know
what
that
10%
was
whether
that
was
10%
in
weight
or
value
but
10%
had
gone
.the
remaining
90%
rested
where
it
had
always
been
and
it
had
been
used
there
domestically
year
after
year.
now
my
point
is
this,
that
plant
had
been
used
in
the
united
states,
it
could
be
used
again.
mr.
roger
f.
day
yes,
i
think
it
could.
10%
could’ve
been
replaced.
the
record
did
not
show
it
could
not
be.
i
wonder
if
the
decision
might
not
have
been
different
in
that
case
if
90%
had
gone
and
10%
remained.
mr.
roger
f.
day
there
was
78%
and
again,
i
don’t
know
of
what
in
the
empresa
case
that
remained
either
uncrated
or
unassembled.
there
was
a
small
part
that
was
crated
and
then
there
was
10%
that
had
been
shipped.
mr.
roger
f.
day
that
is
the
point
i
think,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
f.
day
i
don’t
believe
that
the
old
cases
really
set
up
a
double
test,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
cases
that
have
been
cited
and
argued
to
this
court
show
this
that
movement
--
physical
movement
is
one
of
the
indicia
of
certainty
of
exportation.
how
can
anyone
say
with
things
like
gasoline
and
oil
or
cement
plant
for
that
matter
that
on
tax
listing
day,
they're
bound
to
go
abroad?
they
might
just
as
well
find
a
domestic
home.
you
can
use
gasoline,
oil,
cement
plant,
baseball
bats
just
as
well
in
iowa
as
you
can
in
france
or
germany.
that’s
not
true
of
all
of
these
machines
here.
mr.
roger
f.
day
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
that’s
exactly
what
we’re
saying.
mr.
roger
f.
day
they
were
committed
irrevocably
and
irreversibly
to
the
export
process.
and
they
were
just
as
firmly
and
irrevocably
committed
the
day
before
they
were
shipped
as
five
minutes
after
they
might
have
been
put
on
board
carrier.
mr.
roger
f.
day
no,
your
honor,
we’ve
made
no
claim
for
any
goods
during
the
course
of
manufacture.
now,
we
have
not
made
that
claim
for
two
reasons.
before
the
goods
are
entirely
assembled,
they
are
just
a
collection
of
parts.
and
during
the
course
of
manufacture,
one
part
is
added
to
another
and
the
assemblies
are
put
together.
so
until
they
are
completely
made,
they're
not
so
distinguishable
from
any
other
machines.
that
is
why
our
claim
goes
only
to
those
machines
which
have
been
fully
manufactured,
have
been
moved
to
the
warehouse
and
crated
and
stored
there
awaiting
the
carriers’
arrival.
mr.
roger
f.
day
with
the
label
on
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
roger
f.
day
mr.
justice,
the
record
is
very
clear
on
this
point.
the
machines
in
question
are
manufactured
solely
pursuant
to
foreign
order.
not
one
of
these
machines
is
built
prior
to
that
time.
none
of
the
machines
would
have
existed
or
have
not
or
advanced
prior
order.
mr.
roger
f.
day
that
is
correct
your
honor
or
more
accurately
a
collection
of
machines
--
mr.
roger
f.
day
arising
from
specific
orders.
mr.
roger
f.
day
that’s
correct
your
honor,
they're
in
the
warehouse,
stamped
and
packaged.
mr.
roger
f.
day
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
f.
day
the
record
shows
that
every
machine
that
has
gone
into
the
international
division
has
without
the
exception
found
to
foreign
destination,
without
exception,
i
say.
there
is
one
--
there
was
an
instance
or
two
where
unfortunately,
the
original
order
aborted
because
of
one
reason
or
another.
but
the
company
was
able
to
find
a
home
for
those
goods
in
another
country
that
could
accommodate
them
or
the
language
was
the
same.
but
even
that
is
a
rarity.
i
think
that
your
question
raises
an
important
point
in
this
case.
all
the
prior
cases
have
been
singular
incidence
that
is
one
order
for
a
million
gallons
of
gasoline,
one
order
for
a
cement
plant,
one
order
for
a
thousand
gallons
of
oil.
here,
we
don’t
have
one
order.
we
have
here
a
continuing
business
proposition
of
shipment
after
shipment
after
shipment,
day
after
day,
month
after
month.
and
i
think
that
this
must
affect
the
illegal
conclusion.
most
certainly,
if
the
evidence
showed
that
only
50%
of
these
machines
actually
found
a
foreign
destination,
i
don’t
believe
it
would
be
here
today
because
if
they
all
did
not
go,
it
would
certainly
raise
a
substantial
question
as
to
the
remaining
machines
back
in
the
warehouse.
we
can’t
overlook
that
point.
i
think
it’s
an
element
of
proof
that’s
almost
conclusive.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
further
this
concept
of
motion.
the
state
argues
and
i
expect
would
concede
that
if
these
goods
were
just
simply
loaded
on
a
carrier,
on
tax
listing
day,
just
bringing
them
out
there
and
putting
them
on
a
railroad
car,
a
truck,
maybe
an
airplane.
and
then
at
that
magical
moment,
this
veil
of
immunity
would
settle
over
them.
i
think
that
is
a
too
superficial
view
of
what
immunity
means
here.
most
certainly,
these
goods
are
as
much
an
export
two
seconds
before
they
get
on
that
carrier
as
they
are
two
seconds
afterwards.
and
if
they
are
to
be
diverted,
i
suppose
ncr
could
order
them
taken
off
but
that
does
not
occur.
why
doesn’t
it
occur?
because
there's
no
place
else
for
these
goods
to
go
but
to
the
foreign
destinations
to
serve
those
prior
orders.
mr.
roger
f.
day
i’m
sorry
sir,
i
didn’t
understand.
mr.
roger
f.
day
i
expect
the
state
would
concede,
i
would
know
about
that
without
asking
them.
the
state
argues
one
further
question
--
one
further
point
that
it
alludes
generally
to
what
i
call
a
quid
pro
quo
argument.
the
state
says,
“we’ve
done
something
for
you.
we
should
receive
something
in
return.
mr.
roger
f.
day
the
record
has
not
revealed
that,
your
honor
and
i
am
unable
to
answer
that.
mr.
roger
f.
day
that’s
one
of
the
reasons,
yes.
mr.
roger
f.
day
import,
yes,
in
order
for
the
goods
to
be
exported
abroad,
there
must
be
an
import
license
granted
by
many
countries.
mr.
roger
f.
day
they
simply
will
not
let
goods
come
in
willy-nilly
unless
they
approve
it.
mr.
roger
f.
day
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
f.
day
that’s
correct,
it
does
at
times.
mr.
roger
f.
day
i
cannot
answer
that.
that
the
record
does
not
state
it
and
i
do
not
know
as
a
matter
of
fact.
all
i
know
is
that
they
try
to
speed
up
the
process
as
much
as
they
can.
mr.
roger
f.
day
yes,
they
have
problems
in
shipping
at
times.
mr.
roger
f.
day
yes,
that
is
a
big
problem.
you
cannot
--
many
countries
in
the
world
will
not
permit
goods
to
be
brought
into
that
country
unless
they're
sold
on
certain
financial
terms.
this
is
a
balance
of
trade.
mr.
roger
f.
day
balance
of
payments
problem,
that’s
encountered
often.
i
was
going
to
allude
briefly
to
the
state’s
argument
on
quid
pro
quo,
which
is
simply;
they
ought
to
be
paid
something
for
having
done
something
for
ncr.
now,
i
don’t
know
for
sure
what
that
something
is.
it
is
an
argument
of
general
governmental
services
by
and
large
but
we
point
out
on
our
brief
that
the
national
cash
register
company
has
already
paid
its
way
here.
the
parts,
the
assemblies
of
these
machines
have
been
subjected
to
ohio
personal
property
tax
and
we
have
paid
on
those.
and
we
can
scarcely
see
why
the
general
argument
that
the
state
ought
to
receive
money
should
in
any
way
dilute
the
immunity
granted
by
the
constitution.
i
suppose
that
the
state
of
ohio
was
saying
that
this
court
should
in
some
way
weigh
the
export
immunity
as
it
has
in
the
commerce
clause
area.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
commerce
clause
can
be
equated
with
the
export
immunity
clause
simply
because
the
import-export
immunity
granted
is
a
very
clear
prohibition.
there
is
not
a
room
for
interpretation
as
there
is
in
the
commerce
clause
area.
i
believe
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
put
their
finger
on
this
case
right
on
the
crux
of
it
when
they
said
that
in
this
case,
the
certainty
of
exportation
has
been
fully
proved.
and
it’s
fully
equivalent
to
any
other
test
this
court
has
used
in
the
past
whether
it
be
delivery
to
a
common
carrier,
delivered
to
a
private
carrier,
or
physical
movement.
in
short,
on
tax
listing
day,
these
goods
were
as
much
export
as
they
would
be
at
any
other
time.
that
i
think
is
the
only
question
involved
here.
i
will
not
do
more
than
allude
to
the
national
interest
in
exportation
at
this
time.
i
think
it’s
a
self-evident
proposition.
i
do
not
know
how
much
weight
that
should
be
given
but
if
the
state
argues
that
the
state’s
interest
in
taxation
is
a
great
one,
then
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
the
national
interest
in
fostering
exportation
at
this
time
is
greater
than
it
ever
has
been
in
our
history.
this
has
been
evidenced
by
congressional
actions,
executive
actions,
etcetera,
etcetera.
mr.
roger
f.
day
i
think
it
might
but
it’s
very
difficult
for
us
to
prove
that.
i
believe
that
maybe
this
is
an
instance
where
the
state
should
have
approved
this.
who
can
say
when
a
tax
will
become
such
a
burden
that
it
becomes
difficult
or
insurmountable
burden?
any
tax
is
an
item
of
cost
and
in
order
to
compete
abroad,
all
of
these
items
of
cost
build
up
to
the
point
where
ultimately,
you
can’t
compete.
i
don’t
know
where
the
point
is
but
there
will
be
a
time
when
there's
an
additional
straw
will
break
the
camel’s
back.
i
don’t
know
where
it
is,
though.
mr.
roger
f.
day
it
might
indeed.
mr.
roger
f.
day
no,
your
honor,
i’m
not
suggesting
in
this
case
that
the
law
should
change.
in
fact,
our
whole
argument
is
that
this
case
in
no
way
cuts
across
any
prior
decisions.
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
have
been
fashioned
for
specific
factual
circumstances
with
the
ball
bats,
with
the
oil,
with
the
gasoline,
those
were
all
commodities
that
could
be
used
here
in
the
united
states.
so
in
determining
when
the
certainty
of
exportation
of
those
goods
was
to
be
fixed,
it
was
a
very
reasonable
conclusion
to
say
only
upon
delivery
to
a
carrier.
not
so
here,
the
time
for
fixing
the
immunity
here
is
in
the
warehouse.
that
is
when
they
have
become
fixed
irrevocably
committed.
mr.
roger
f.
day
i
think
your
recollection
is
essentially
correct
on
that,
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
that
concludes
our
argument.
mr.
roger
f.
day
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
we
agree
that
there
was
a
point
in
time
where
the
immunity
provided
by
the
constitution
will
preclude
a
state
or
locality
from
the
levying
of
tax
upon
it.
the
question
is
simply
when
that
that
time
and
if
that
time
has
arrived
in
this
case.
i
will
not
dwell
on
the
facts
of
this
case
because
they're
entirely
not
disputed.
there
is
no
controversy
or
whatever
i
think
between
the
state
and
the
company
over
the
facts.
but
i
would
like
to
spend
a
few
moments
in
addressing
myself
to
the
question,
why
should
physical
motion
be
required
to
be
shown
before
the
immunity
provided
by
the
export
clause
attaches?
it’s
our
position
that
in
this
case,
there
is
no
need
whatsoever
for
showing
physical
motion
before
immunity
does
attach.
why
not?
simply
because
the
physical
character
of
the
goods
in
question
demonstrates
conclusively
that
the
goods
can’t
go
any
place
else
but
overseas.
these
machines
are
unique,
they
were
built
pursuant
to
foreign
orders,
they
were
constructed
to
serve
foreign
customers,
they
can’t
be
used
in
the
united
states,
so
when
these
machines
have
moved
to
the
ncr
warehouse,
have
been
packaged
and
crated
and
are
stamped
of
their
exportation
destination
placed
upon
them,
they
are
at
that
moment
exports
in
every
real
sense
just
as
much
as
the
next
day
when
they
are
loaded
aboard
the
carrier.
now
the
state
--
mr.
roger
f.
day
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
true.
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
there
are
some
instances
where
this
has
occurred.
those
instances
are
not
the
everyday
occurrence.
i
want
to
make
that
clear.
there
is
certainly
no
incentive
for
national
cash
register
to
keep
its
goods
stored
in
the
warehouse.
the
sooner
they
can
move
them
out,
the
sooner
they
can
get
paid.
these
instances
that
have
occurred
like
that
have
occurred
not
because
of
ncr’s
desire
but
solely
because
of
problems
with
the
foreign
license
problem,
the
foreign
exchange
problem
that
prevents
them
from
sending
them.
mr.
roger
f.
day
these
goods
that
are
in
question
are
not
in
movement
as
of
tax
day.
they
are
in
the
warehouse
of
ncr.
mr.
roger
f.
day
they
are
there
for
about
three
reasons,
your
honor.
the
shipments
that
are
made
are
made
of
an
order.
and
this
order
maybe
composed
--
mr.
roger
f.
day
well,
that
maybe
one
reason
your
honor,
yes.
another
reason
is
we
have
--
mr.
roger
f.
day
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
the
other
reasons
are
these.
the
goods
are
not
--
these
machines
are
not
all
produced
at
one
time.
they
are
produced
day
by
day
so
they
have
to
be
collected
until
the
entire
order
is
ready
for
shipment.
that’s
another
reason.
another
reason
is
--
mr.
roger
f.
day
i’m
sorry?
i
didn’t
understand
your
question.
mr.
roger
f.
day
on
some
occasions,
yes.
they
will
be
sent
on
open
account
on
some
instances.
on
some
instances,
they
will
be
sent
on
letters
of
credit
--
mr.
roger
f.
day
i
think
that’s
probably
true
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
roger
f.
day
that
is
absolutely
correct.
we
do
not
contest
that
one
bit.
mr.
roger
f.
day
the
question
to
which
i
want
to
address
myself
is
why
should
motion
be
required?
now
the
state
i’m
sure
would
concede
--
mr.
roger
f.
day
it
differs
in
this
respect,
your
honor.
they
were
dealing
there
with
logs.
logs
is
a
commodity
that
has
a
domestic
use
equal
to
a
foreign
use.
in
short,
logs
can
be
used
anywhere
to
make
lumber.
and
now
in
that
instance
like
joy
oil
which
involved
gasoline,
and
like
the
other
cases
which
involves
goods
of
that
type,
there
is
no
way
on
tax
listing
date
that
you
can
say
for
sure
that
those
products
or
those
goods
are
going
to
go
abroad
unless
they
have
been
evidenced
to
be
in
motion.
mr.
roger
f.
day
fungibility
is
one
word
that
can
be
used,
yes.
i
think
more
accurately,
whether
or
not
the
goods
have
a
domestic
use.
whether
they
are
fungible
or
not
is
a
crucial
inquire.
mr.
roger
f.
day
it
was
not
fungible,
your
honor
and
that’s
why
i
alluded
to
the
domestic
use.
the
empresa
case
dealt
with
what
was
termed
as
cement
plant.
that
was
only
a
convenient
term
of
reference.
as
a
cement
plant,
it
involved
a
whole
host
of
things,
machinery
and
equipments,
supplies,
parts
and
a
cement
plant
which
was
in
process
of
being
dismantled.
as
of
tax
listing
day,
i
think
the
record
in
that
case
revealed
that
about
10%
of
it
had
been
shipped.
i
don’t
know
what
that
10%
was
whether
that
was
10%
in
weight
or
value
but
10%
had
gone
.the
remaining
90%
rested
where
it
had
always
been
and
it
had
been
used
there
domestically
year
after
year.
now
my
point
is
this,
that
plant
had
been
used
in
the
united
states,
it
could
be
used
again.
mr.
roger
f.
day
yes,
i
think
it
could.
10%
could’ve
been
replaced.
the
record
did
not
show
it
could
not
be.
i
wonder
if
the
decision
might
not
have
been
different
in
that
case
if
90%
had
gone
and
10%
remained.
mr.
roger
f.
day
there
was
78%
and
again,
i
don’t
know
of
what
in
the
empresa
case
that
remained
either
uncrated
or
unassembled.
there
was
a
small
part
that
was
crated
and
then
there
was
10%
that
had
been
shipped.
mr.
roger
f.
day
that
is
the
point
i
think,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
f.
day
i
don’t
believe
that
the
old
cases
really
set
up
a
double
test,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
cases
that
have
been
cited
and
argued
to
this
court
show
this
that
movement
--
physical
movement
is
one
of
the
indicia
of
certainty
of
exportation.
how
can
anyone
say
with
things
like
gasoline
and
oil
or
cement
plant
for
that
matter
that
on
tax
listing
day,
they're
bound
to
go
abroad?
they
might
just
as
well
find
a
domestic
home.
you
can
use
gasoline,
oil,
cement
plant,
baseball
bats
just
as
well
in
iowa
as
you
can
in
france
or
germany.
that’s
not
true
of
all
of
these
machines
here.
mr.
roger
f.
day
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice
that’s
exactly
what
we’re
saying.
mr.
roger
f.
day
they
were
committed
irrevocably
and
irreversibly
to
the
export
process.
and
they
were
just
as
firmly
and
irrevocably
committed
the
day
before
they
were
shipped
as
five
minutes
after
they
might
have
been
put
on
board
carrier.
mr.
roger
f.
day
no,
your
honor,
we’ve
made
no
claim
for
any
goods
during
the
course
of
manufacture.
now,
we
have
not
made
that
claim
for
two
reasons.
before
the
goods
are
entirely
assembled,
they
are
just
a
collection
of
parts.
and
during
the
course
of
manufacture,
one
part
is
added
to
another
and
the
assemblies
are
put
together.
so
until
they
are
completely
made,
they're
not
so
distinguishable
from
any
other
machines.
that
is
why
our
claim
goes
only
to
those
machines
which
have
been
fully
manufactured,
have
been
moved
to
the
warehouse
and
crated
and
stored
there
awaiting
the
carriers’
arrival.
mr.
roger
f.
day
with
the
label
on
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
roger
f.
day
mr.
justice,
the
record
is
very
clear
on
this
point.
the
machines
in
question
are
manufactured
solely
pursuant
to
foreign
order.
not
one
of
these
machines
is
built
prior
to
that
time.
none
of
the
machines
would
have
existed
or
have
not
or
advanced
prior
order.
mr.
roger
f.
day
that
is
correct
your
honor
or
more
accurately
a
collection
of
machines
--
mr.
roger
f.
day
arising
from
specific
orders.
mr.
roger
f.
day
that’s
correct
your
honor,
they're
in
the
warehouse,
stamped
and
packaged.
mr.
roger
f.
day
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
f.
day
the
record
shows
that
every
machine
that
has
gone
into
the
international
division
has
without
the
exception
found
to
foreign
destination,
without
exception,
i
say.
there
is
one
--
there
was
an
instance
or
two
where
unfortunately,
the
original
order
aborted
because
of
one
reason
or
another.
but
the
company
was
able
to
find
a
home
for
those
goods
in
another
country
that
could
accommodate
them
or
the
language
was
the
same.
but
even
that
is
a
rarity.
i
think
that
your
question
raises
an
important
point
in
this
case.
all
the
prior
cases
have
been
singular
incidence
that
is
one
order
for
a
million
gallons
of
gasoline,
one
order
for
a
cement
plant,
one
order
for
a
thousand
gallons
of
oil.
here,
we
don’t
have
one
order.
we
have
here
a
continuing
business
proposition
of
shipment
after
shipment
after
shipment,
day
after
day,
month
after
month.
and
i
think
that
this
must
affect
the
illegal
conclusion.
most
certainly,
if
the
evidence
showed
that
only
50%
of
these
machines
actually
found
a
foreign
destination,
i
don’t
believe
it
would
be
here
today
because
if
they
all
did
not
go,
it
would
certainly
raise
a
substantial
question
as
to
the
remaining
machines
back
in
the
warehouse.
we
can’t
overlook
that
point.
i
think
it’s
an
element
of
proof
that’s
almost
conclusive.
i
would
like
to
address
myself
further
this
concept
of
motion.
the
state
argues
and
i
expect
would
concede
that
if
these
goods
were
just
simply
loaded
on
a
carrier,
on
tax
listing
day,
just
bringing
them
out
there
and
putting
them
on
a
railroad
car,
a
truck,
maybe
an
airplane.
and
then
at
that
magical
moment,
this
veil
of
immunity
would
settle
over
them.
i
think
that
is
a
too
superficial
view
of
what
immunity
means
here.
most
certainly,
these
goods
are
as
much
an
export
two
seconds
before
they
get
on
that
carrier
as
they
are
two
seconds
afterwards.
and
if
they
are
to
be
diverted,
i
suppose
ncr
could
order
them
taken
off
but
that
does
not
occur.
why
doesn’t
it
occur?
because
there's
no
place
else
for
these
goods
to
go
but
to
the
foreign
destinations
to
serve
those
prior
orders.
mr.
roger
f.
day
i’m
sorry
sir,
i
didn’t
understand.
mr.
roger
f.
day
i
expect
the
state
would
concede,
i
would
know
about
that
without
asking
them.
the
state
argues
one
further
question
--
one
further
point
that
it
alludes
generally
to
what
i
call
a
quid
pro
quo
argument.
the
state
says,
“we’ve
done
something
for
you.
we
should
receive
something
in
return.
mr.
roger
f.
day
the
record
has
not
revealed
that,
your
honor
and
i
am
unable
to
answer
that.
mr.
roger
f.
day
that’s
one
of
the
reasons,
yes.
mr.
roger
f.
day
import,
yes,
in
order
for
the
goods
to
be
exported
abroad,
there
must
be
an
import
license
granted
by
many
countries.
mr.
roger
f.
day
they
simply
will
not
let
goods
come
in
willy-nilly
unless
they
approve
it.
mr.
roger
f.
day
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
f.
day
that’s
correct,
it
does
at
times.
mr.
roger
f.
day
i
cannot
answer
that.
that
the
record
does
not
state
it
and
i
do
not
know
as
a
matter
of
fact.
all
i
know
is
that
they
try
to
speed
up
the
process
as
much
as
they
can.
mr.
roger
f.
day
yes,
they
have
problems
in
shipping
at
times.
mr.
roger
f.
day
yes,
that
is
a
big
problem.
you
cannot
--
many
countries
in
the
world
will
not
permit
goods
to
be
brought
into
that
country
unless
they're
sold
on
certain
financial
terms.
this
is
a
balance
of
trade.
mr.
roger
f.
day
balance
of
payments
problem,
that’s
encountered
often.
i
was
going
to
allude
briefly
to
the
state’s
argument
on
quid
pro
quo,
which
is
simply;
they
ought
to
be
paid
something
for
having
done
something
for
ncr.
now,
i
don’t
know
for
sure
what
that
something
is.
it
is
an
argument
of
general
governmental
services
by
and
large
but
we
point
out
on
our
brief
that
the
national
cash
register
company
has
already
paid
its
way
here.
the
parts,
the
assemblies
of
these
machines
have
been
subjected
to
ohio
personal
property
tax
and
we
have
paid
on
those.
and
we
can
scarcely
see
why
the
general
argument
that
the
state
ought
to
receive
money
should
in
any
way
dilute
the
immunity
granted
by
the
constitution.
i
suppose
that
the
state
of
ohio
was
saying
that
this
court
should
in
some
way
weigh
the
export
immunity
as
it
has
in
the
commerce
clause
area.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
commerce
clause
can
be
equated
with
the
export
immunity
clause
simply
because
the
import-export
immunity
granted
is
a
very
clear
prohibition.
there
is
not
a
room
for
interpretation
as
there
is
in
the
commerce
clause
area.
i
believe
that
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
put
their
finger
on
this
case
right
on
the
crux
of
it
when
they
said
that
in
this
case,
the
certainty
of
exportation
has
been
fully
proved.
and
it’s
fully
equivalent
to
any
other
test
this
court
has
used
in
the
past
whether
it
be
delivery
to
a
common
carrier,
delivered
to
a
private
carrier,
or
physical
movement.
in
short,
on
tax
listing
day,
these
goods
were
as
much
export
as
they
would
be
at
any
other
time.
that
i
think
is
the
only
question
involved
here.
i
will
not
do
more
than
allude
to
the
national
interest
in
exportation
at
this
time.
i
think
it’s
a
self-evident
proposition.
i
do
not
know
how
much
weight
that
should
be
given
but
if
the
state
argues
that
the
state’s
interest
in
taxation
is
a
great
one,
then
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
the
national
interest
in
fostering
exportation
at
this
time
is
greater
than
it
ever
has
been
in
our
history.
this
has
been
evidenced
by
congressional
actions,
executive
actions,
etcetera,
etcetera.
mr.
roger
f.
day
i
think
it
might
but
it’s
very
difficult
for
us
to
prove
that.
i
believe
that
maybe
this
is
an
instance
where
the
state
should
have
approved
this.
who
can
say
when
a
tax
will
become
such
a
burden
that
it
becomes
difficult
or
insurmountable
burden?
any
tax
is
an
item
of
cost
and
in
order
to
compete
abroad,
all
of
these
items
of
cost
build
up
to
the
point
where
ultimately,
you
can’t
compete.
i
don’t
know
where
the
point
is
but
there
will
be
a
time
when
there's
an
additional
straw
will
break
the
camel’s
back.
i
don’t
know
where
it
is,
though.
mr.
roger
f.
day
it
might
indeed.
mr.
roger
f.
day
no,
your
honor,
i’m
not
suggesting
in
this
case
that
the
law
should
change.
in
fact,
our
whole
argument
is
that
this
case
in
no
way
cuts
across
any
prior
decisions.
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
have
been
fashioned
for
specific
factual
circumstances
with
the
ball
bats,
with
the
oil,
with
the
gasoline,
those
were
all
commodities
that
could
be
used
here
in
the
united
states.
so
in
determining
when
the
certainty
of
exportation
of
those
goods
was
to
be
fixed,
it
was
a
very
reasonable
conclusion
to
say
only
upon
delivery
to
a
carrier.
not
so
here,
the
time
for
fixing
the
immunity
here
is
in
the
warehouse.
that
is
when
they
have
become
fixed
irrevocably
committed.
mr.
roger
f.
day
i
think
your
recollection
is
essentially
correct
on
that,
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
that
concludes
our
argument.
