justice

and
finally
the
last
opinion
and
judgment
that
i
am
authorized
to
announce
this
morning
is
in
the
case
of
robert
j.
kosydar
who
is
the
tax
commissioner
of
ohio,
petitioner
in
this
case,
against
the
national
cash
register
company,
respondent
number
73-629,
a
case
which
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
in
this
case,
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
held
by
a
divided
vote
that
the
import-export
clause
of
the
constitution
that
is
article
1,
section
10,
clause
2,
prevented
the
state
from
assessing
an
ad
valorem
property
tax
upon
goods
specially
manufactured
by
the
respondent
company
for
shipment
to
customers
overseas,
but
temporarily
resting
in
the
respondent’s
warehouse
in
dayton,
ohio.
since
the
goods
have
not
yet
actually
entered
into
the
stream
of
international
commerce,
we
hold,
upon
the
reasoning
and
the
authority
of
our
prior
decisions,
that
ohio
was
constitutionally
free
to
impose
a
tax
upon
the
goods
in
question.
accordingly
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ohio
supreme
court.
