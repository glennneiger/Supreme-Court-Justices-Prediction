unknown
speaker
would
those
machines
have
any
scarp
value
at
all?
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
cement
plant,
wasn’t
the
tax
imposed
only
on
those
parts
thereof
up
not
already
in
the
stream
of
commerce?
unknown
speaker
those
are
only
part
of
the
cement
plant
that’s
taxed?
unknown
speaker
are
you
not
relying
on
the
joy
oil
case
when
you
say
[voice
overlap].
unknown
speaker
the
part
of
the
cement
plant
that
wasn’t
taxed
in
siderurgica
had
actually
left
the
country,
hasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
historical
justification
for
the
view
that
the
original
meaning
of
this
clause
was
to
prevent
a
second
state,
was
only
to
prevent
a
second
state
from
imposing
tax
on
imports,
i.e.
take
this
case
of
ohio
and
contiguous
to
ohio
and
pennsylvania.
ohio
has
no
access
to
the
ocean
and
the
seas
or
the
international
trade,
pennsylvania
does.
and
that
the
purpose
was
to
prevent
pennsylvania
for
laying
a
tax
on
exports
from
ohio
to
the
ports
say
of
philadelphia
to
go
overseas.
unknown
speaker
that
the
seacoast
states
couldn’t
discriminate
against
the
interior
states
and
thereby
get
a
competitive
advantage
in
international
trade.
wasn’t
that
the
historical
background
of
this?
unknown
speaker
well
aren’t
those
services
covered
by
the
tax
on
the
warehouse
unknown
speaker
maybe?
well
i
assume
that
any
warehouse
in
ohio
is
paying
property
taxes.
unknown
speaker
you
emphasized
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
true
mr.
day
even
if
they
were
kept
in
the
warehouse
for
three
years
in
that
condition?
unknown
speaker
well
you
don’t
say
they're
not
in
movement.
unknown
speaker
but
why
are
they
not
being
moved?
unknown
speaker
the
reason
is
because
you
haven’t
got
the
money.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
have
got
the
money,
is
there
any
other
reason?
unknown
speaker
well,
away
from
these,
i
assume
the
whole
order
groups
are
still
sitting
there?
unknown
speaker
well
you
don’t
send
them
until
you
get
the
money
do
you?
unknown
speaker
there
are
some
countries
you
won’t
send
them
to
until
you
get
the
bank
--
get
the
money
and
put
the
money
in
bank
and
make
sure
it
stays
there,
isn’t
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
your
whole
point
is
that
they
are
not
in
transit
by
any
stretch
of
imagination.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
day,
in
that
connection,
how
does
your
case
differ
from
the
old
case
involving
the
logs
that
were
detained
up
in
new
hampshire
on
the
way
to
maine?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
you're
placing
everything
on
fungibility,
aren’t
you?
unknown
speaker
was
the
cement
plant
part
fungible?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
the
90%
of
it
could
be?
unknown
speaker
but
40%
was
crated,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
what
your
argument
comes
down
to
and
maybe
its
perfectly
sound
is
really
certainty
of
destination.
unknown
speaker
and
this
sounds
to
me
like
it’s
a
single
test
rather
than
a
double
on
that
the
old
cases
seem
to
propose.
unknown
speaker
how
about
during
the
period
while
they
were
being
manufactured,
would
you
say
that
this
test
would
say
they
were
exempt
then?
unknown
speaker
with
the
label
on?
unknown
speaker
mr.
day,
before
you
go
on,
does
respondent
manufacture
these
machines
only
where
they
have
specific
orders
for
them
or
does
it
manufacture
generally
for
inventory
--
the
finished
goods
inventory?
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
specific
order
for
so
many
machines
of
such
and
such
of
type.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
and
you
said
i
think
that
they
were
crated
and
the
destination
of
each
crate
is
on
the
crate?
unknown
speaker
so
you
know
whether
it’s
going
to
venezuela
or
to
britain?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
that
i
would
agree
too
if
you
put
them
on
the
railroad
warehouse,
wouldn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
i
assume
both
sides
would
agree
if
you
put
the
cash
register
in
the
warehouse
of
the
railroad.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
mr.
day
in
that
respect,
is
there
any
average
time
that
a
given
machine
sits
there
in
the
warehouse,
does
it
--
is
there
something
like
an
average
of
two
months,
three
months,
two
years
or
something?
unknown
speaker
but
do
i
understand
that
an
order
maybe
for
a
number
of
different
machines?
and
the
order
all
has
to
be
shipped
at
once
and
some
things
are
manufactured
and
stored
but
not
shipped
because
you
have
to
wait
until
the
rest
of
the
orders
were
manufactured,
is
that
so?
unknown
speaker
and
now,
and
then
what’s
this
about
foreign
countries
sometimes
then
take
import
permits
or
something?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
even
though
some
parts
there
--
maybe
anxious
to
get
what
they
ordered
from
you.
they
can’t
until
they
gets
the
permit
to
bring
it
in,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
and
sometimes,
that
takes
a
long
time,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
and
it’s
on
the
average
or
about
that
or
--?
unknown
speaker
and
is
there
any
problem
with
shipping
which
causes
delay
or
something?
unknown
speaker
and
then
i
gather
there
is
also
that
mr.
justice
marshall
asked
earlier
sometimes
problems
of
financing?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
a
decision
against
your
client
in
this
case
prevent
or
impede
or
impair
exportations?
unknown
speaker
thus,
mr.
day,
this
factor
ten
years
hence,
might
cut
the
other
way?
unknown
speaker
and
you’re
not
suggesting
that
the
law
should
changed
because
the
factors
changes?
unknown
speaker
mr.
day,
this
is
really
not
very
relevant
to
this
case.
but
i
have
had
some
time
to
time
discussions
with
some
of
my
brothers
about
the
syllabus
rule
in
ohio
and
my
recollection
is
that
by
way
--
by
reason
of
statute
in
ohio,
the
syllabus
is
the
law
and
the
only
the
syllabus
is
the
law
in
a
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
except
when
it’s
a
per
curiam
opinion
in
which
cases,
the
whole
per
curiam
is
the
law
and
there
is
no
syllabus,
do
i
--
is
that
is
my
recollection
correct?
and
if
so
is
--
unknown
speaker
annually?
unknown
speaker
well,
$50,000.00
what?
unknown
speaker
how
does
this
case
arise
now?
hasn’t
this
been
going
on
for
sometime
that
the
tax
division
just
catch-up
to
it
or
what?
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
that
ncr
has
been
doing
this
for
years.
i
just
wondered
what
made
it
important
as
of
1967
or
whenever
it
was?
unknown
speaker
does
that
imply
it
was
taxed
before?
unknown
speaker
the
case
in
many
respects
says
a
1930
character
to
it.
it’s
the
kind
of

that
