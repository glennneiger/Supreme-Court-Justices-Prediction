mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
continuing
conflict
between
the
state’s
power
to
tax
and
the
prohibition
from
taxing
exports
contained
in
the
import-export
clause,
which
is
article
i,
section
10,
clause
2.
this
case
originated
by
the
tax
commissioner
of
ohio
issuing
a
tangible
personal
property
tax
assessment
against
national
cash
register
(ncr)
and
issuing
it
against
their
international
inventories
which
were
located
and
resting
in
dayton,
ohio
on
a
tax
listing
date
which
was
december
31,
1967.
the
national
cash
register
appealed
this
assessment
to
the
ohio
board
of
tax
appeals,
which
is
an
administrative
body
and
it
did
affirm
the
tax
commissioner.
upon
appeal
to
the
ohio
supreme
court
by
the
ncr,
the
court
in
which
we
considered
an
unprecedented
decision
of
5:2
overturn
100
years,
this
court
has
carefully
developed
the
definition
of
export
and
held
that
the
property
in
question
was
in
fact
an
export.
it
is
our
contention
that
tangible
personal
property
located
in
a
state
on
tax
listing
date
is
subject
to
the
state’s
right
to
tax.
and
that’s
especially
clear
where
in
a
situation
like
this
the
property
has
received
something
from
the
state
for
which
the
state
can
ask
something
in
return
and
where
no
movement
of
any
sort
has
occurred
toward
a
stream
of
exportation.
the
facts
in
this
case
basically
are
not
in
dispute.
the
national
cash
register
company
has
its
world
headquarters,
main
production
facilities
and
warehouse
in
dayton,
ohio.
it
primarily
manufactures
cash
registers,
accounting
machines
and
data
processing
machines.
it
markets
these
throughout
the
united
states
and
in
124
foreign
countries.
when
a
foreign
order
is
placed
with
ncr,
it
is
sent
to
the
factory
in
dayton
where
the
product
is
manufactured.
ncr
maintains
no
inventory
of
machines,
capable
of
meeting
incoming
orders
from
foreign
customers.
this
is
because
many
countries
will
not
allow
a
partial
shipment
and
because
in
some
cases,
the
import
licenses
cannot
be
gotten.
after
the
machine
is
produced
and
inspected,
it
is
packaged
for
export
shipment.
the
property
involved
in
this
case
was
specifically
constructed
for
foreign
customers,
finished,
crated
and
in
storage
and
inventory
in
ncr’s
warehouse
awaiting
foreign
shipment
on
december
31,
1967
when
ohio
personal
property
taxation
was
assessed.
so
on
tax
listing
date,
which
was
december
31st,
1967,
payment
had
not
been
made
to
ncr
by
the
perspective
purchasers,
no
export
license
had
been
issued,
no
letter
of
credit
authorized,
the
machines
were
in
complete
control
of
ncr,
and
of
most
importance,
no
movement
toward
the
foreign
destination
had
occurred.
and
according
to
ncr’s
on
witness,
this
means
the
items
were
in
inventory
and
that
is
prior
to
when
the
items
had
been
put
on
board,
the
commercial
carrier
had
actually
left
the
shipping
dock.
some
machines
have
remained
in
storage
in
the
warehouse
awaiting
shipment
for
up
to
three
years.
the
record
does
show
that
no
machines
manufactured
by
ncr
were
ever
diverted
or
are
capable
of
being
diverted
to
the
domestic
market.
due
to
special
construction,
the
machines
could
not
economically
be
converted
from
domestic
use
and
sale.
the
record
shows
that
against
ncr’s
profit
margin
of
about
5%,
the
conversion
cost
would
be
approximately
16%
of
the
cost
of
the
machine.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
i
would
imagine
they
would
show
the
--
the
record
does
not
show
that
but
i’m
sure
they
would.
it
is
our
position
that
in
interpreting
the
import-export
clause
of
the
u.s.
constitution,
this
court
has
had
at
least
seven
occasions
in
which
to
consider
the
question
and
this
started
in
1886
and
the
last
one
was
in
1949.
and
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
court
has
taken
a
consistent
position
and
that
being
is
that
there
is
not
export
until
movement
--
final
movement
does
occur.
i
would
like
very
briefly
to
discuss
three
of
these
cases
if
i
may,
which
we
think
represents
this
court’s
opinion.
the
first
case
of
importance
is
coe
versus
errol
and
this
was
an
1886
case.
in
that
case,
this
court
dealt
with
a
factual
situation
of
spruce
logs,
which
were
cut
in
new
hampshire
and
placed
in
a
stream
to
be
floated
down
the
river
to
maine.
they
were
detained
in
errol,
new
hampshire
by
little
water
and
they
were
taxed
there.
this
court
struggled
with
the
issue
of
whether
the
products
of
the
state
are
liable
to
be
taxed
like
other
property
in
the
state
though
intended
for
exportation.
and
the
answer
was
yes.
this
court
held
that
until
there
is
actual
or
final
movement
that
the
goods
apart
from
the
general
mass
and
property
of
the
state
and
are
subject
to
taxation.
the
court
also
stated
that
the
owner’s
state
of
mind,
in
other
words,
his
intent
did
not
cause
the
exemption
from
taxation
to
occur.
the
next
important
case
we
believe
is
a.
g.
spalding,
which
this
court
considered
in
1923
and
the
reason
that
case
was
important
was
because
mr.
justice
holmes
noted
that
a
point
must
be
fixed
at
which
the
export
must
be
said
to
begin.
he
said,
“it
was
important
to
note
that
because
in
some
cases,
there
is
a
point
very
near
on
one
side
or
the
other
and
unless
the
point
is
fixed,
any
determination
may
seem
arbitrary.”
the
most
recent
decision
of
this
court
and
one
in
which
the
facts
are
most
similar
to
this
case
is
the
empresa
case
in
1949.
in
that
case,
a
cement
plant
in
california
was
sold
to
a
south
american
corporation
for
export.
an
export
license
was
issued,
title
passed,
and
a
common
carrier
was
hired
to
dismantle
and
package
the
plant
for
shipment.
the
county
levied
a
personal
property
tax
on
the
parts
of
the
plant,
and
it
had
not
been
shipped
out
of
the
country.
mr.
justice
douglas
held
that
it
was
taxable
stating
that
it
is
not
enough
--
intent
to
export
is
not
enough.
it
is
in
fact
the
entrance
of
the
articles
into
the
export’s
steam
that
marks
the
start
of
the
process
of
exportation
and
he
stated
that
nothing
less
would
suffice.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
yes,
it
basically
could
your
honor
but
--
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
whether
there
is
scrap
value
or
not.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
they
are
not
--
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
it
may
have
been.
i
do
not
know
from
--
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
that
is
correct.
those
that
had
been
shipped
there
was
no
tax
assessed
--
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
yes,
we
did
discuss
it
in
the
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
that
is
correct.
there
was
actual
movement.
it
had
left
the
country.
in
this
case,
there
has
been
no
actual
movement
at
all
other
than
from
the
actual
manufacturing
facility
to
the
storage
facility,
which
is
in
the
same
town,
dayton,
ohio.
we
contend
that
these
cases,
which
represent
almost
100
years
of
supreme
court
precedence,
say
that
a
state
can
tax
tangible
personal
property
which
is
located
in
that
state
and
the
export
exemption
only
attaches
when
the
property
is
exported.
and
that
means
when
it
has
actually
began
its
final
movement
in
the
export
stream.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
we
believe
that
to
be
true
and
madison’s
debate,
which
we
mentioned
in
our
brief
state
that
we
believe
or
that
the
intent
was
to
ensure
the
free
flow
of
goods
among
the
states
and
not
--
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
it
to
be.
we
believe
that
the
test
is
not
whether
there
is
certainty
of
export
as
the
respondent
states
here.
certainly
at
some
time
in
the
future
is
not
enough.
in
the
case
at
bar
on
tax
listing
date,
the
property
was
resting
in
ohio.
it
was
also
a
part
of
the
general
mass
of
property
in
ohio
and
it
was
receiving
something
from
ohio
in
which
ohio
--
for
which
ohio
had
a
right
to
ask
something
in
return.
for
example,
take
the
property
that
was
in
ohio
for
three
years,
if
respondent’s
position
is
correct,
then
during
each
one
of
those
three
years,
the
property
was
receiving
services
from
the
state
of
ohio
yet
since
there
was
certainty
of
export
that
ohio
could
not
levy
a
tax
on
these
goods
and
we
do
not
believe
--
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
yes
--
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
some
protection
but
from
what
were
saying
is
they
get
a
lot
more
by
staying
in
the
warehouse
for
three
years.
and
during
that
three-year
period,
the
services
provided
by
the
state
of
ohio
make
it
more
certain
that
these
goods
will
in
fact
be
in
saleable
condition
when
their
export
journey
actually
does
commence.
so
there
is
an
additional
service.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
maybe
again
in
part,
your
honor.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
this
is
also
a
tangible
personal
property
tax
assessment.
the
question
is
not
whether
ncr
has
paid
a
great
deal
of
taxes
--
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
certainly
not,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
policy
also
dictates
that
the
ohio
supreme
court’s
decision
be
reversed.
the
effect
of
recognizing
an
earlier
point
would
curtail
a
power
of
the
state
to
tax
and
we
believe
that
would
be
in
conflict
with
the
trend
of
recognizing
the
importance
of
meeting
state
revenue
needs.
there
is
a
tremendous
growing
need
for
state
services
and
we
feel
that
when
property
is
in
a
state
and
located
there
and
is
part
of
the
general
mass
on
tax
listing
date
that
the
right
should
be
granted
to
the
state
to
tax
that
property.
i
believe
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
necessary.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
we
believe
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
state’s
right
to
tax
tangible
personal
property
located
within
that
state
and
if
that’s
the
primary
issue,
not
whether
there
is
--
whether
the
test
is
not
certainty
of
export.
it’s
the
state’s
right
to
tax.
in
that
sense,
i
would
like
to
quote
from
joy
oil
where
this
court
said
that,
“the
export-import
clause
was
meant
to
confer
immunity
from
local
taxation
upon
property
being
exported,
not
to
relieve
property
eventually
to
be
exported
from
its
share
of
the
cost
of
local
services."
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
these
specific
machines
have
been
taxed.
they
have
not
so
that
although
national
cash
register
is
paying
real
property
taxes
and
maybe
paying
other
types
of
tangible
personal
property
taxes
on
other
things,
it
has
not
paid
any
taxes
on
the
specific
machines
and
issue
here
today.
although
some
of
them
conceivably
could’ve
been
in
ohio
for
several
or
at
least
for
a
period
of
time
and
derived
services
during
that
period
of
time.
secondly,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
what
effect
if
any
ohio
tangible
personal
property
taxation
had
upon
these
goods
in
question,
whether
they
had
any
effect
or
whatsoever
on
their
salability
or
ncr’s
ability
to
compete
in
the
foreign
market.
the
amount
of
tax
here
in
question
today
is
slightly
less
than
$50,000.00
although
the
actual
assessment
was
$1
million
when
you
reduce
that
by
the
applicable
percentage,
we
are
only
talking
about
$50,000.00.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
it
varies
from
year
to
year.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
it
would
be
for
this
one
year,
1968
additional
assessment.
there
was
another
assessment.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
no,
an
assessment
was
made
and
there
generally
is
a
several
year
lag
between
when
property
is
returned
and
when
an
audit
is
made
by
the
tax
commissioner
staff
and
the
various
levels
of
litigation
involved.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
i
believe
in
this
specific
year,
national
cash
register
filed
what
they
call
a
902
claim
in
which
they
asked
that
the
international
inventory
be
released
from
tangible
personal
property
taxation
based
upon
this
issue
at
the
tax
commissioner’s
level
and
the
tax
commissioner
refused.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
it
was
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
that
effect.
also
--
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
very
well
be.
finally,
i
think
it’s
important
to
note
that
the
present
test
that
this
court
has
provided
for
us
is
objective,
whereas
the
test
of
certainty
of
export
is
very
subjective.
we
believe
that
contrary
to
respondent’s
position
that
the
--
one
of
the
primary
reasons
there
has
been
little
litigation
on
this
subject
is
because
the
test
as
it
currently
exists
is
objective
rather
than
subjective.
and
we
believe
that
the
test
if
adopted
by
this
court
as
proposed
by
the
respondent
would
become
a
subjective
test
and
would
be
much
more
difficult
for
tax
personnel
to
administer,
and
also,
a
much
more
difficult
for
taxpayers
to
perceive
and
follow
adequately.
thank
you.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
concerns
the
continuing
conflict
between
the
state’s
power
to
tax
and
the
prohibition
from
taxing
exports
contained
in
the
import-export
clause,
which
is
article
i,
section
10,
clause
2.
this
case
originated
by
the
tax
commissioner
of
ohio
issuing
a
tangible
personal
property
tax
assessment
against
national
cash
register
(ncr)
and
issuing
it
against
their
international
inventories
which
were
located
and
resting
in
dayton,
ohio
on
a
tax
listing
date
which
was
december
31,
1967.
the
national
cash
register
appealed
this
assessment
to
the
ohio
board
of
tax
appeals,
which
is
an
administrative
body
and
it
did
affirm
the
tax
commissioner.
upon
appeal
to
the
ohio
supreme
court
by
the
ncr,
the
court
in
which
we
considered
an
unprecedented
decision
of
5:2
overturn
100
years,
this
court
has
carefully
developed
the
definition
of
export
and
held
that
the
property
in
question
was
in
fact
an
export.
it
is
our
contention
that
tangible
personal
property
located
in
a
state
on
tax
listing
date
is
subject
to
the
state’s
right
to
tax.
and
that’s
especially
clear
where
in
a
situation
like
this
the
property
has
received
something
from
the
state
for
which
the
state
can
ask
something
in
return
and
where
no
movement
of
any
sort
has
occurred
toward
a
stream
of
exportation.
the
facts
in
this
case
basically
are
not
in
dispute.
the
national
cash
register
company
has
its
world
headquarters,
main
production
facilities
and
warehouse
in
dayton,
ohio.
it
primarily
manufactures
cash
registers,
accounting
machines
and
data
processing
machines.
it
markets
these
throughout
the
united
states
and
in
124
foreign
countries.
when
a
foreign
order
is
placed
with
ncr,
it
is
sent
to
the
factory
in
dayton
where
the
product
is
manufactured.
ncr
maintains
no
inventory
of
machines,
capable
of
meeting
incoming
orders
from
foreign
customers.
this
is
because
many
countries
will
not
allow
a
partial
shipment
and
because
in
some
cases,
the
import
licenses
cannot
be
gotten.
after
the
machine
is
produced
and
inspected,
it
is
packaged
for
export
shipment.
the
property
involved
in
this
case
was
specifically
constructed
for
foreign
customers,
finished,
crated
and
in
storage
and
inventory
in
ncr’s
warehouse
awaiting
foreign
shipment
on
december
31,
1967
when
ohio
personal
property
taxation
was
assessed.
so
on
tax
listing
date,
which
was
december
31st,
1967,
payment
had
not
been
made
to
ncr
by
the
perspective
purchasers,
no
export
license
had
been
issued,
no
letter
of
credit
authorized,
the
machines
were
in
complete
control
of
ncr,
and
of
most
importance,
no
movement
toward
the
foreign
destination
had
occurred.
and
according
to
ncr’s
on
witness,
this
means
the
items
were
in
inventory
and
that
is
prior
to
when
the
items
had
been
put
on
board,
the
commercial
carrier
had
actually
left
the
shipping
dock.
some
machines
have
remained
in
storage
in
the
warehouse
awaiting
shipment
for
up
to
three
years.
the
record
does
show
that
no
machines
manufactured
by
ncr
were
ever
diverted
or
are
capable
of
being
diverted
to
the
domestic
market.
due
to
special
construction,
the
machines
could
not
economically
be
converted
from
domestic
use
and
sale.
the
record
shows
that
against
ncr’s
profit
margin
of
about
5%,
the
conversion
cost
would
be
approximately
16%
of
the
cost
of
the
machine.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
i
would
imagine
they
would
show
the
--
the
record
does
not
show
that
but
i’m
sure
they
would.
it
is
our
position
that
in
interpreting
the
import-export
clause
of
the
u.s.
constitution,
this
court
has
had
at
least
seven
occasions
in
which
to
consider
the
question
and
this
started
in
1886
and
the
last
one
was
in
1949.
and
in
each
of
these
cases,
the
court
has
taken
a
consistent
position
and
that
being
is
that
there
is
not
export
until
movement
--
final
movement
does
occur.
i
would
like
very
briefly
to
discuss
three
of
these
cases
if
i
may,
which
we
think
represents
this
court’s
opinion.
the
first
case
of
importance
is
coe
versus
errol
and
this
was
an
1886
case.
in
that
case,
this
court
dealt
with
a
factual
situation
of
spruce
logs,
which
were
cut
in
new
hampshire
and
placed
in
a
stream
to
be
floated
down
the
river
to
maine.
they
were
detained
in
errol,
new
hampshire
by
little
water
and
they
were
taxed
there.
this
court
struggled
with
the
issue
of
whether
the
products
of
the
state
are
liable
to
be
taxed
like
other
property
in
the
state
though
intended
for
exportation.
and
the
answer
was
yes.
this
court
held
that
until
there
is
actual
or
final
movement
that
the
goods
apart
from
the
general
mass
and
property
of
the
state
and
are
subject
to
taxation.
the
court
also
stated
that
the
owner’s
state
of
mind,
in
other
words,
his
intent
did
not
cause
the
exemption
from
taxation
to
occur.
the
next
important
case
we
believe
is
a.
g.
spalding,
which
this
court
considered
in
1923
and
the
reason
that
case
was
important
was
because
mr.
justice
holmes
noted
that
a
point
must
be
fixed
at
which
the
export
must
be
said
to
begin.
he
said,
“it
was
important
to
note
that
because
in
some
cases,
there
is
a
point
very
near
on
one
side
or
the
other
and
unless
the
point
is
fixed,
any
determination
may
seem
arbitrary.”
the
most
recent
decision
of
this
court
and
one
in
which
the
facts
are
most
similar
to
this
case
is
the
empresa
case
in
1949.
in
that
case,
a
cement
plant
in
california
was
sold
to
a
south
american
corporation
for
export.
an
export
license
was
issued,
title
passed,
and
a
common
carrier
was
hired
to
dismantle
and
package
the
plant
for
shipment.
the
county
levied
a
personal
property
tax
on
the
parts
of
the
plant,
and
it
had
not
been
shipped
out
of
the
country.
mr.
justice
douglas
held
that
it
was
taxable
stating
that
it
is
not
enough
--
intent
to
export
is
not
enough.
it
is
in
fact
the
entrance
of
the
articles
into
the
export’s
steam
that
marks
the
start
of
the
process
of
exportation
and
he
stated
that
nothing
less
would
suffice.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
yes,
it
basically
could
your
honor
but
--
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
whether
there
is
scrap
value
or
not.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
they
are
not
--
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
it
may
have
been.
i
do
not
know
from
--
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
that
is
correct.
those
that
had
been
shipped
there
was
no
tax
assessed
--
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
yes,
we
did
discuss
it
in
the
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
that
is
correct.
there
was
actual
movement.
it
had
left
the
country.
in
this
case,
there
has
been
no
actual
movement
at
all
other
than
from
the
actual
manufacturing
facility
to
the
storage
facility,
which
is
in
the
same
town,
dayton,
ohio.
we
contend
that
these
cases,
which
represent
almost
100
years
of
supreme
court
precedence,
say
that
a
state
can
tax
tangible
personal
property
which
is
located
in
that
state
and
the
export
exemption
only
attaches
when
the
property
is
exported.
and
that
means
when
it
has
actually
began
its
final
movement
in
the
export
stream.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
yes
your
honor,
we
believe
that
to
be
true
and
madison’s
debate,
which
we
mentioned
in
our
brief
state
that
we
believe
or
that
the
intent
was
to
ensure
the
free
flow
of
goods
among
the
states
and
not
--
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
yes,
i
believe
it
to
be.
we
believe
that
the
test
is
not
whether
there
is
certainty
of
export
as
the
respondent
states
here.
certainly
at
some
time
in
the
future
is
not
enough.
in
the
case
at
bar
on
tax
listing
date,
the
property
was
resting
in
ohio.
it
was
also
a
part
of
the
general
mass
of
property
in
ohio
and
it
was
receiving
something
from
ohio
in
which
ohio
--
for
which
ohio
had
a
right
to
ask
something
in
return.
for
example,
take
the
property
that
was
in
ohio
for
three
years,
if
respondent’s
position
is
correct,
then
during
each
one
of
those
three
years,
the
property
was
receiving
services
from
the
state
of
ohio
yet
since
there
was
certainty
of
export
that
ohio
could
not
levy
a
tax
on
these
goods
and
we
do
not
believe
--
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
yes
--
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
some
protection
but
from
what
were
saying
is
they
get
a
lot
more
by
staying
in
the
warehouse
for
three
years.
and
during
that
three-year
period,
the
services
provided
by
the
state
of
ohio
make
it
more
certain
that
these
goods
will
in
fact
be
in
saleable
condition
when
their
export
journey
actually
does
commence.
so
there
is
an
additional
service.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
maybe
again
in
part,
your
honor.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
this
is
also
a
tangible
personal
property
tax
assessment.
the
question
is
not
whether
ncr
has
paid
a
great
deal
of
taxes
--
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
certainly
not,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
policy
also
dictates
that
the
ohio
supreme
court’s
decision
be
reversed.
the
effect
of
recognizing
an
earlier
point
would
curtail
a
power
of
the
state
to
tax
and
we
believe
that
would
be
in
conflict
with
the
trend
of
recognizing
the
importance
of
meeting
state
revenue
needs.
there
is
a
tremendous
growing
need
for
state
services
and
we
feel
that
when
property
is
in
a
state
and
located
there
and
is
part
of
the
general
mass
on
tax
listing
date
that
the
right
should
be
granted
to
the
state
to
tax
that
property.
i
believe
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
necessary.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
we
believe
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
state’s
right
to
tax
tangible
personal
property
located
within
that
state
and
if
that’s
the
primary
issue,
not
whether
there
is
--
whether
the
test
is
not
certainty
of
export.
it’s
the
state’s
right
to
tax.
in
that
sense,
i
would
like
to
quote
from
joy
oil
where
this
court
said
that,
“the
export-import
clause
was
meant
to
confer
immunity
from
local
taxation
upon
property
being
exported,
not
to
relieve
property
eventually
to
be
exported
from
its
share
of
the
cost
of
local
services."
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
these
specific
machines
have
been
taxed.
they
have
not
so
that
although
national
cash
register
is
paying
real
property
taxes
and
maybe
paying
other
types
of
tangible
personal
property
taxes
on
other
things,
it
has
not
paid
any
taxes
on
the
specific
machines
and
issue
here
today.
although
some
of
them
conceivably
could’ve
been
in
ohio
for
several
or
at
least
for
a
period
of
time
and
derived
services
during
that
period
of
time.
secondly,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
what
effect
if
any
ohio
tangible
personal
property
taxation
had
upon
these
goods
in
question,
whether
they
had
any
effect
or
whatsoever
on
their
salability
or
ncr’s
ability
to
compete
in
the
foreign
market.
the
amount
of
tax
here
in
question
today
is
slightly
less
than
$50,000.00
although
the
actual
assessment
was
$1
million
when
you
reduce
that
by
the
applicable
percentage,
we
are
only
talking
about
$50,000.00.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
it
varies
from
year
to
year.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
it
would
be
for
this
one
year,
1968
additional
assessment.
there
was
another
assessment.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
no,
an
assessment
was
made
and
there
generally
is
a
several
year
lag
between
when
property
is
returned
and
when
an
audit
is
made
by
the
tax
commissioner
staff
and
the
various
levels
of
litigation
involved.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
i
believe
in
this
specific
year,
national
cash
register
filed
what
they
call
a
902
claim
in
which
they
asked
that
the
international
inventory
be
released
from
tangible
personal
property
taxation
based
upon
this
issue
at
the
tax
commissioner’s
level
and
the
tax
commissioner
refused.
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
it
was
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
that
effect.
also
--
mr.
dwight
c.
pettay,
jr.
very
well
be.
finally,
i
think
it’s
important
to
note
that
the
present
test
that
this
court
has
provided
for
us
is
objective,
whereas
the
test
of
certainty
of
export
is
very
subjective.
we
believe
that
contrary
to
respondent’s
position
that
the
--
one
of
the
primary
reasons
there
has
been
little
litigation
on
this
subject
is
because
the
test
as
it
currently
exists
is
objective
rather
than
subjective.
and
we
believe
that
the
test
if
adopted
by
this
court
as
proposed
by
the
respondent
would
become
a
subjective
test
and
would
be
much
more
difficult
for
tax
personnel
to
administer,
and
also,
a
much
more
difficult
for
taxpayers
to
perceive
and
follow
adequately.
thank
you.
