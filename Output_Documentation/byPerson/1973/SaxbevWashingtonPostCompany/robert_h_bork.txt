mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
respondents,
the
washington
post
company
and
a
reporter
ben
bagdikian,
brought
this
action
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
challenging
as
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
policy
prohibiting
members
of
the
press
from
obtaining
personal
interviews
with
pre-selected
inmates.
petitioners
here,
the
attorney
general,
and
mr.
carlson,
the
director
of
the
united
states
bureau
of
prisons
were
defendants
below.
in
the
courts
below,
the
plaintiffs-respondents
complaint
sought
by
way
of
declaratory
judgment
an
injunctive
relief
to
gain
access
to
any
and
all
inmates
in
the
federal
prison
system.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
however
gave
more
limited
relief
in
which
the
presumption
appears
to
be
according
to
the
relief
granted
that
press
interviews
will
be
allowed
unless
there
are
serious
administrative
or
disciplinary
problems
likely
to
be
solved.
in
other
word,
the
district
court
was
--
they
say
affirmed
with
slight
modification
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
position
to
the
parties
i
think
have
shifted
slightly
in
this
court.
respondents
now
adopt
and
defend
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
have
informed
this
court
and
we’ll
mention
again
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
will
soon
promulgate
a
new
policy,
which
prohibits
interviews,
pre-selected
inmates,
only
in
those
institutions
where
the
bureau
deems
it
essential
that
is
maximum
and
medium
security
institutions.
all
other
institutions,
prison
farms,
halfway
houses,
youth
and
juvenile
institutions
for
example
will
permit
press
interviews
under
reasonable
regulations
as
to
time
and
place.
this
policy
now
correlates
the
rule
about
interviews
with
the
director’s
judgment
about
which
institutions
are
at
tension-filled
and
which
institutions
that
policy
is
necessary.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
this
case
comes
down
now
therefore
i
think
simply
to
the
question
of
the
bureau’s
power
to
maintain
a
no
interview
rule
in
maximum
security
and
medium
security
facilities.
those
are
facilities
with
strong
perimeter
guards,
walls,
double
fences,
and
so
forth.
i
think
it’s
important
to
be
quite
clear
about
what
this
case
involves
and
what
this
case
does
not
involve.
and
i
think
i
have
to
say
that
i
believe
that
the
first
amendment
claim
here
is
not
at
the
core
of
first
amendment
because
i
think
they
are
relatively
attenuated
first
amendment
claim,
and
i
say
that
for
two
reasons.
one,
it
does
not
involve
any
inhibition
on
the
right
to
publish.
this
is
a
claim
of
a
right
of
access
to
news-worthy
information
which
i
think
is
not
at
the
core
of
the
first
amendment.
and
secondly,
we
have
the
claim
made
in
a
prison
context
which
is
a
regulated
context,
in
which
many
constitutional
rights
vary
because
of
the
nature
of
the
context,
and
in
which
primary
discretion
is
entrusted
to
the
director
of
bureau
of
prisons.
what
this
case
does
involve
is
a
restriction
on
one
of
many
modes
of
access
to
news.
it
is
not
enough
to
argue
i
think
as
respondents
do,
that
they
could
do
a
more
effective
job
of
reporting
if
this
mode
of
access
were
also
available
to
them.
as
i
have
said
the
core
of
first
amendment’s
guarantee
is
the
freedom
to
publish.
the
amendment’s
application
to
rights
of
access
is
ancillary
to
the
freedom
to
publish.
and
as
the
branzburg
opinion
reminds
us,
rights
of
access
may
be
limited
by
government
for
reasons
which
would
not
give
government
the
power
or
the
right
to
limit
publication.
the
branzburg
opinion
gives
examples
of
that,
i
think
zemel
against
rusk,
kleindienst
against
mandel
are
other
instances
where
access
may
be
denied
lawfully
although
publication
could
not
lawfully
be
prevented.
that’s
frequent
in
governmental
life
i
think
it’s
properly
so
surely
a
judge
could
tell
his
law
clerks.
but
they
may
not
give
interviews
to
the
press
about
pending
cases.
and
i
assume
they
could
discharge
a
clerk
who
did
even
though
he
might
not
be
able
to
enjoin
the
publication
if
the
information
was
given.
now
in
this
case,
the
press
has
so
many
sources
of
information
and
the
minor
restrictions
placed
on
this
one
journalistic
technique
is
so
vital
of
prison
administration
that
i
find
it
difficult
to
think
there
is
a
valid
first
amendment
claim.
i
would
think,
i
would
urge
that
the
proper
method
of
review
is
to
ask
whether
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
adopted
a
regulation
which
lies
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness
which
accommodates
the
competing
policies
in
a
manner
that
can
be
said
to
be
rational
and
to
be
reasonable.
because
any
other
mode
of
review
will
involve
courts
in
effect
in
second
guessing
the
administrative
decisions
of
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
in
detail
in
the
guides
of
constitutional
adjudication.
it
will
also
prevent
the
evolution
of
prison
policy
and
for
policy
in
these
matters
or
the
matter
does
evolve
in
the
federal
bureau
of
prison
system.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
about
the
communications
with
the
press,
mr.
justice
douglas?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
congress
has
legislated
as
to
certain
matters
dealing
with
the
prison
but
much
of
the
control
is
delegated
to
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
--
mr.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
we
are
in
the
field
of
federal
regulation
that
mr.
justice
douglas
and
i
think,
congress
would
not
need
to
legislate
under
the
first
amendment.
it
could
just
regulate
the
prisons
as
it
see
is
fit,
and
if
it
wishes
to
do
so
of
course
may
implement
first
amendment
values
although
it
need
not
use
the
first
amendment
as
a
source
of
legislative
power.
these
are
the
federal
institutions.
but
recalling
that
this
is
a
regulated
context
where
regulation
of
constitutional
rights
is
permissible,
and
i
think
that
the
zone
of
reasonableness
is
the
proper
standard
to
judge
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
standards,
i
think
we
might
examine
the
actual
claim
in
this
case.
respondents
and
varies
amici
pitch
this
case
on
the
press’
need
to
learn
about
prison
conditions,
and
the
allegation
is
prison
conditions
require
reform
and
if
the
press
can’t
tell
us
about
them
we
won’t
know
about
them
and
won’t
reform
them.
i
would
suggest
that
there’s
almost
nothing
about
prison
conditions
certainly
nothing
about
general
conditions,
but
the
press
cannot
now
learn
with
this.
i
would
like
just
to
run
through
the
sources
of
information
available
to
the
press
now
about
prison
conditions.
even
for
example
in
a
maximum
security
prison
like
leavenworth.
it’s
been
pointed
out
that
the
press
are
completely
free
to
correspond
at
any
link
as
many
times
as
decided
with
any
or
all
inmates,
and
to
do
so
confidentially.
and
that
is
the
new
policy
that
was
the
policy
adopted
by
the
director
recently.
it
was
not
in
existence
before.
this
his
attempt
to
experiment
to
find
out
means
of
getting
information
out
without
causing
serious
problems
to
disciplinary
rehabilitation.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no.
i
don’t
believe
so
mr.
justice
blackmun,
if
i
am
wrong,
i
will
correct
myself
later.
i
believe
that
policy
was
promulgated
as
a
part
of
a
general
view
of
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
entirely
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
has
been,
and
these
policies
are
under
constant
review
and
discussion
with
the
wardens
and
with
other
persons
within
the
central
office
who
have
specialized
knowledge,
sociologist,
psychologist,
and
so
forth.
and
experience
causes
modification
in
these
policies,
and
the
tendency
now
is
towards
more
openness
insofar
as
that
can
be
done.
that’s
a
process
that’s
going
forward
i
would
hate
to
see
it
set
in
contrary
all
of
the
sudden
by
constitutional
rulings.
a
concept
of
a
zone
of
reasonableness
gives
the
system
a
little
elbow
room,
a
little
play
in
the
joints.
there
is
the
correspondence.
secondly,
the
press
is
given
interviews
freely
by
the
wardens
and
the
other
personnel
of
the
bureau
of
prisons.
third,
the
press
is
free.
it
is
encouraged
to
tour
the
prisons
and
inspect
any
office,
any
and
all
facilities
and
equipment,
and
programs;
and
on
such
a
tour
there
is
no
part
of
a
prison
that
is
close
to
the
press.
they
may
go
into
the
segregated
facilities
and
they
may
converse
with
prisoners
in
segregation,
as
well
as,
with
any
other
inmates
they
dropped
into.
in
fact,
mr.
bagdikian
was
offered
an
opportunity
to
do
precisely
that.
the
inmates
at
a
prison
who
had
led
us
right
we’re
in
segregation.
he
was
offered
the
chance
to
tour
the
segregated
facilities,
and
converse
with
them
not
at
length
in-depth
interviews
but
to
converse
with
them.
he
chose
not
to.
fourth,
members
of
the
press
may
obtain
interviews
with
groups
of
prisoners
who
are
randomly
selected.
mr.
bagdikian
was
given
such
an
interview
with
no
prison
officials
present.
now,
members
of
the
press
of
course
may
also
interview
any
visitors
who
have
been
to
see
an
inmate.
his
lawyer,
his
family,
his
attorney,
all
of
these
persons
may
talk
to
the
inmate
in
complete
confidence
and
may
then
talk
to
the
reporter.
and
sixth,
i
think
if
we’re
talking
about
general
prison
condition,
it
ought
to
be
noted
that
members
of
the
press
may
of
course
freely
interview
all
of
the
inmates
who
are
being
released
from
prison,
and
that’s
a
constant
flow
of
men
at
any
one
time,
i
think
its
approximately
half
of
the
entire
federal
prison
population
will
be
out
within
one
year.
at
leavenworth
for
example,
during
fiscal
1973,
415
men
were
released
which
is
an
average
of
34-35
men
a
month.
now,
most
of
those
men
are
processed
out
from
prison
farms
or
halfway
houses,
but
they
under
this
new
policy
can
be
reached
as
soon
as
they
leave
leavenworth
and
get
into
the
halfway
house
or
the
prison
farm.
so,
we
have
a
constant
flow
of
inmates
who
can
tell
you
immediately
about
the
conditions
they
just
left
behind
aside
from
the
correspondence,
the
tours,
and
everything
else
was
provided.
although
there
are
six
channels
of
information
that
give
the
press,
i
think
complete
ability
to
learn
what
they
want
to
know
about
prison
conditions
accurately
and
promptly.
respondents’
brief
refers
to
these
rules
as
a
dam
against
information.
i
think
this
general
rules,
views
and
context,
act
more
like
a
sieve.
information
comes
out
freely
and
easily
and
the
only
kind
of
journalistic
technique,
which
is
forbidden,
is
the
one
that
raises
severe
problems
for
discipline
and
for
rehabilitation.
well,
what’s
left?
respondents
concede
they
may
be
properly
denied
interviews
during
times
of
riot
or
heighten
tension
in
the
prison.
so,
what
is
really
left
in
the
first
amendment
claim
is
the
right
to
pre-select
an
inmate
for
a
confidential
interview
when
there
isn’t
riot
or
tension
in
the
prison.
and
in
fact,
does
that
usually
mean
the
right
to
interview
a
celebrity.
interview
a
jimmy
hoffa,
phillip
berrigan,
or
to
interview
a
disruptive
inmate
who
has
just
made
the
news
because
he’s
lead
a
work
stoppage
or
a
riot.
and
it
is
the
latter
of
course
is
particularly
troublesome
because
that
man
becomes
a
leader
by
leading
a
trouble
and
then
by
broadcasting
his
inflammatory
charges
direct
to
the
press.
and
hardly
enough,
the
very
rule
of
respondents
are
arguing
for
would
cut-off
access
to
that
man
as
soon
he
did
it,
because
he
would
become
the
disruptive
figure.
so,
i
think
the
rule
you
are
asking
for
is
really
not
a
rule
that
makes
a
great
deal
of
sense
from
anybody’s
worth.
it
ought
to
be
said
that
it
is
very
odd
to
claim
this
kind
of
right
of
access
in
the
prison
context.
the
maximum
and
medium
security
prisons
constitute
the
most
tensed,
volatile,
violence-prone
society
i
suppose
on
the
face
of
the
earth.
the
bureau
of
prison
simply
cannot
maintain
discipline
and
effect
rehabilitation,
which
they
have
done
with
increasing
effect
of
us.
if
press
interviews
are
permitted
to
create
or
maintain
disruptive
inmate
leaders,
that
much
is
conceded
by
the
courts
are
blown
and
apparently
by
the
respondents.
but
they
think
a
case-by-case
approach
will
cure
it,
i
don’t
think
so
i
think
it
would
damage
rehabilitation
or
harm
discipline.
in
the
first
place,
there
is
inherent
discrimination
between
inmates.
the
man
who
is
disruptive
who
they
alienated
who
is
hostile
will
not
be
allowed
to
have
interviews,
while
man
who
says
more
pleasant
things
will
be
not
because
the
warden
is
trying
to
control
contents
but
you
do
get
a
control
of
content
when
you
say
the
disruptive
hostile
alienated
man
cannot
speak
to
everyone.
and
you
also
get
tension
and
unhappiness
as
between
prisoners.
furthermore,
wardens
are
going
to
be
required
to
guess
under
this
new
policy
about
who
is
likely
to
be
dangerous.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
at
the
court
of
appeals
policy,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
suggests
they
have
to
have
some
past
experience
with
this
man
to
believe
that
he
is
disruptive.
well,
they
may
have
a
subjective
feeling
that
he
is
disruptive
and
he
may
be
quite
right.
but
they
are
going
to
be
required
to
guess,
sometimes
they
are
going
to
guess
wrong,
and
you
may
have
seriously
harmful
even
tragic
results.
and
i
would
add
this,
even
if
a
notorious
inmate
proves
not
disruptive
within
the
prison.
it
seems
to
me
that
constant
press
attention
which
could
not
be
denied
then
if
he
was
not
disruptive
is
totally
inconsistent
with
the
idea
of
an
opportunity
for
penitence
and
for
rehabilitation.
a
man
who
is
--
becomes
the
object
of
the
press
and
his
opinions
are
cited
everywhere
is
not
likely
to
repent.
he
will
maintain
his
status
and
come
out
of
the
prison.
i
was
thinking
once
the
same
condition
at
least
that’s
what
director
of
prisons
thinks.
finally,
i
will
suggest
that
there’ll
be
increase
litigation.
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
suggest
we
have
to
have
certain
kinds
of
experience,
it
didn’t
order
to
deny
an
interview,
i
think
we’re
going
to
have
let
the
case
made
or
record
made
and
we
are
going
to
be
at
the
courts
all
the
time,
and
that’s
a
heavy
administrative
burden.
i
will
say
one
last
word.
i
think
the
first
amendment
itself
cuts
against
this
case-by-case
policy.
if
the
press
has
full
access
to
the
prisons,
we
are
going
to
have
to
decide,
who
is
the
press?
now,
respondent
say,
you’ve
already
done
that,
you
have
a
definition
of
the
press.
that
was
a
definition
adopted
as
a
matter
of
administrative
discretion
about
constitutional
pressure.
once
it
is
stated
that
the
definition
is
controlled
by
the
constitution
then
we
have
a
government
official.
in
the
first
instance
a
warden
of
a
penitentiary
deciding
who
qualifies
as
the
press
and
who
does
not.
that
becomes
something
like
an
official
licensing
policy
if
made
under
the
first
amendment,
and
i
think
that’s
a
concept,
its
an
(inaudible)
to
the
first
amendment.
we
submit
in
short
that
the
considerations
of
the
first
amendment,
consideration
to
the
prison
context,
considerations
of
the
deference
due
to
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
suggest
that
the
case
be
reversed,
and
that
the
director
be
allowed
to
go
forward
under
the
policy
statement
is
promulgated.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
just
rise
to
note
that
the
federal
--
we
here
about
the
white-collar
prisoners.
the
federal
prisons
in
fact
are
not
staff
entirely
by
white-collar
criminal
who
just
violated
the
antitrust
laws
systemwide.
50%
of
the
prisoners
are
convicted
of
crimes
of
serious
violence
against
the
person
on
major
narcotics
traffickers
who
are
also
regardless
of
violence
threat
in
the
prison.
those
numbers
are
much
higher
in
the
maximum
and
medium
security
prisoners.
we
are
dealing
with
a
dangerous
and
notable
population.
the
testimony
of
the
wardens
below
--
the
federal
wardens
said
that
they
perceived
on
the
experience
of
the
states.
we
have
the
experience
of
california
which
states
it
proceeded.
they
perceived
that
this
kind
of
interview
was
quite
troublesome
so
that
of
course
they
have
to
rehabilitate
and
to
maintain
order.
it
is
always
difficult
to
link
one
event
with
the
result
in
human
activity.
there
best
judgment
is
that
there
is
such
a
link,
california’s
best
judgment
isn’t
the
reason
to
make.
i
think
that’s
a
judgment
they
are
entitled
to
make.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
respondents,
the
washington
post
company
and
a
reporter
ben
bagdikian,
brought
this
action
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
challenging
as
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment,
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
policy
prohibiting
members
of
the
press
from
obtaining
personal
interviews
with
pre-selected
inmates.
petitioners
here,
the
attorney
general,
and
mr.
carlson,
the
director
of
the
united
states
bureau
of
prisons
were
defendants
below.
in
the
courts
below,
the
plaintiffs-respondents
complaint
sought
by
way
of
declaratory
judgment
an
injunctive
relief
to
gain
access
to
any
and
all
inmates
in
the
federal
prison
system.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
however
gave
more
limited
relief
in
which
the
presumption
appears
to
be
according
to
the
relief
granted
that
press
interviews
will
be
allowed
unless
there
are
serious
administrative
or
disciplinary
problems
likely
to
be
solved.
in
other
word,
the
district
court
was
--
they
say
affirmed
with
slight
modification
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
position
to
the
parties
i
think
have
shifted
slightly
in
this
court.
respondents
now
adopt
and
defend
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
i
have
informed
this
court
and
we’ll
mention
again
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
will
soon
promulgate
a
new
policy,
which
prohibits
interviews,
pre-selected
inmates,
only
in
those
institutions
where
the
bureau
deems
it
essential
that
is
maximum
and
medium
security
institutions.
all
other
institutions,
prison
farms,
halfway
houses,
youth
and
juvenile
institutions
for
example
will
permit
press
interviews
under
reasonable
regulations
as
to
time
and
place.
this
policy
now
correlates
the
rule
about
interviews
with
the
director’s
judgment
about
which
institutions
are
at
tension-filled
and
which
institutions
that
policy
is
necessary.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
this
case
comes
down
now
therefore
i
think
simply
to
the
question
of
the
bureau’s
power
to
maintain
a
no
interview
rule
in
maximum
security
and
medium
security
facilities.
those
are
facilities
with
strong
perimeter
guards,
walls,
double
fences,
and
so
forth.
i
think
it’s
important
to
be
quite
clear
about
what
this
case
involves
and
what
this
case
does
not
involve.
and
i
think
i
have
to
say
that
i
believe
that
the
first
amendment
claim
here
is
not
at
the
core
of
first
amendment
because
i
think
they
are
relatively
attenuated
first
amendment
claim,
and
i
say
that
for
two
reasons.
one,
it
does
not
involve
any
inhibition
on
the
right
to
publish.
this
is
a
claim
of
a
right
of
access
to
news-worthy
information
which
i
think
is
not
at
the
core
of
the
first
amendment.
and
secondly,
we
have
the
claim
made
in
a
prison
context
which
is
a
regulated
context,
in
which
many
constitutional
rights
vary
because
of
the
nature
of
the
context,
and
in
which
primary
discretion
is
entrusted
to
the
director
of
bureau
of
prisons.
what
this
case
does
involve
is
a
restriction
on
one
of
many
modes
of
access
to
news.
it
is
not
enough
to
argue
i
think
as
respondents
do,
that
they
could
do
a
more
effective
job
of
reporting
if
this
mode
of
access
were
also
available
to
them.
as
i
have
said
the
core
of
first
amendment’s
guarantee
is
the
freedom
to
publish.
the
amendment’s
application
to
rights
of
access
is
ancillary
to
the
freedom
to
publish.
and
as
the
branzburg
opinion
reminds
us,
rights
of
access
may
be
limited
by
government
for
reasons
which
would
not
give
government
the
power
or
the
right
to
limit
publication.
the
branzburg
opinion
gives
examples
of
that,
i
think
zemel
against
rusk,
kleindienst
against
mandel
are
other
instances
where
access
may
be
denied
lawfully
although
publication
could
not
lawfully
be
prevented.
that’s
frequent
in
governmental
life
i
think
it’s
properly
so
surely
a
judge
could
tell
his
law
clerks.
but
they
may
not
give
interviews
to
the
press
about
pending
cases.
and
i
assume
they
could
discharge
a
clerk
who
did
even
though
he
might
not
be
able
to
enjoin
the
publication
if
the
information
was
given.
now
in
this
case,
the
press
has
so
many
sources
of
information
and
the
minor
restrictions
placed
on
this
one
journalistic
technique
is
so
vital
of
prison
administration
that
i
find
it
difficult
to
think
there
is
a
valid
first
amendment
claim.
i
would
think,
i
would
urge
that
the
proper
method
of
review
is
to
ask
whether
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
adopted
a
regulation
which
lies
within
the
zone
of
reasonableness
which
accommodates
the
competing
policies
in
a
manner
that
can
be
said
to
be
rational
and
to
be
reasonable.
because
any
other
mode
of
review
will
involve
courts
in
effect
in
second
guessing
the
administrative
decisions
of
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
in
detail
in
the
guides
of
constitutional
adjudication.
it
will
also
prevent
the
evolution
of
prison
policy
and
for
policy
in
these
matters
or
the
matter
does
evolve
in
the
federal
bureau
of
prison
system.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
about
the
communications
with
the
press,
mr.
justice
douglas?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
congress
has
legislated
as
to
certain
matters
dealing
with
the
prison
but
much
of
the
control
is
delegated
to
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well
--
mr.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
i
think
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
we
are
in
the
field
of
federal
regulation
that
mr.
justice
douglas
and
i
think,
congress
would
not
need
to
legislate
under
the
first
amendment.
it
could
just
regulate
the
prisons
as
it
see
is
fit,
and
if
it
wishes
to
do
so
of
course
may
implement
first
amendment
values
although
it
need
not
use
the
first
amendment
as
a
source
of
legislative
power.
these
are
the
federal
institutions.
but
recalling
that
this
is
a
regulated
context
where
regulation
of
constitutional
rights
is
permissible,
and
i
think
that
the
zone
of
reasonableness
is
the
proper
standard
to
judge
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
standards,
i
think
we
might
examine
the
actual
claim
in
this
case.
respondents
and
varies
amici
pitch
this
case
on
the
press’
need
to
learn
about
prison
conditions,
and
the
allegation
is
prison
conditions
require
reform
and
if
the
press
can’t
tell
us
about
them
we
won’t
know
about
them
and
won’t
reform
them.
i
would
suggest
that
there’s
almost
nothing
about
prison
conditions
certainly
nothing
about
general
conditions,
but
the
press
cannot
now
learn
with
this.
i
would
like
just
to
run
through
the
sources
of
information
available
to
the
press
now
about
prison
conditions.
even
for
example
in
a
maximum
security
prison
like
leavenworth.
it’s
been
pointed
out
that
the
press
are
completely
free
to
correspond
at
any
link
as
many
times
as
decided
with
any
or
all
inmates,
and
to
do
so
confidentially.
and
that
is
the
new
policy
that
was
the
policy
adopted
by
the
director
recently.
it
was
not
in
existence
before.
this
his
attempt
to
experiment
to
find
out
means
of
getting
information
out
without
causing
serious
problems
to
disciplinary
rehabilitation.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no.
i
don’t
believe
so
mr.
justice
blackmun,
if
i
am
wrong,
i
will
correct
myself
later.
i
believe
that
policy
was
promulgated
as
a
part
of
a
general
view
of
the
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
entirely
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
has
been,
and
these
policies
are
under
constant
review
and
discussion
with
the
wardens
and
with
other
persons
within
the
central
office
who
have
specialized
knowledge,
sociologist,
psychologist,
and
so
forth.
and
experience
causes
modification
in
these
policies,
and
the
tendency
now
is
towards
more
openness
insofar
as
that
can
be
done.
that’s
a
process
that’s
going
forward
i
would
hate
to
see
it
set
in
contrary
all
of
the
sudden
by
constitutional
rulings.
a
concept
of
a
zone
of
reasonableness
gives
the
system
a
little
elbow
room,
a
little
play
in
the
joints.
there
is
the
correspondence.
secondly,
the
press
is
given
interviews
freely
by
the
wardens
and
the
other
personnel
of
the
bureau
of
prisons.
third,
the
press
is
free.
it
is
encouraged
to
tour
the
prisons
and
inspect
any
office,
any
and
all
facilities
and
equipment,
and
programs;
and
on
such
a
tour
there
is
no
part
of
a
prison
that
is
close
to
the
press.
they
may
go
into
the
segregated
facilities
and
they
may
converse
with
prisoners
in
segregation,
as
well
as,
with
any
other
inmates
they
dropped
into.
in
fact,
mr.
bagdikian
was
offered
an
opportunity
to
do
precisely
that.
the
inmates
at
a
prison
who
had
led
us
right
we’re
in
segregation.
he
was
offered
the
chance
to
tour
the
segregated
facilities,
and
converse
with
them
not
at
length
in-depth
interviews
but
to
converse
with
them.
he
chose
not
to.
fourth,
members
of
the
press
may
obtain
interviews
with
groups
of
prisoners
who
are
randomly
selected.
mr.
bagdikian
was
given
such
an
interview
with
no
prison
officials
present.
now,
members
of
the
press
of
course
may
also
interview
any
visitors
who
have
been
to
see
an
inmate.
his
lawyer,
his
family,
his
attorney,
all
of
these
persons
may
talk
to
the
inmate
in
complete
confidence
and
may
then
talk
to
the
reporter.
and
sixth,
i
think
if
we’re
talking
about
general
prison
condition,
it
ought
to
be
noted
that
members
of
the
press
may
of
course
freely
interview
all
of
the
inmates
who
are
being
released
from
prison,
and
that’s
a
constant
flow
of
men
at
any
one
time,
i
think
its
approximately
half
of
the
entire
federal
prison
population
will
be
out
within
one
year.
at
leavenworth
for
example,
during
fiscal
1973,
415
men
were
released
which
is
an
average
of
34-35
men
a
month.
now,
most
of
those
men
are
processed
out
from
prison
farms
or
halfway
houses,
but
they
under
this
new
policy
can
be
reached
as
soon
as
they
leave
leavenworth
and
get
into
the
halfway
house
or
the
prison
farm.
so,
we
have
a
constant
flow
of
inmates
who
can
tell
you
immediately
about
the
conditions
they
just
left
behind
aside
from
the
correspondence,
the
tours,
and
everything
else
was
provided.
although
there
are
six
channels
of
information
that
give
the
press,
i
think
complete
ability
to
learn
what
they
want
to
know
about
prison
conditions
accurately
and
promptly.
respondents’
brief
refers
to
these
rules
as
a
dam
against
information.
i
think
this
general
rules,
views
and
context,
act
more
like
a
sieve.
information
comes
out
freely
and
easily
and
the
only
kind
of
journalistic
technique,
which
is
forbidden,
is
the
one
that
raises
severe
problems
for
discipline
and
for
rehabilitation.
well,
what’s
left?
respondents
concede
they
may
be
properly
denied
interviews
during
times
of
riot
or
heighten
tension
in
the
prison.
so,
what
is
really
left
in
the
first
amendment
claim
is
the
right
to
pre-select
an
inmate
for
a
confidential
interview
when
there
isn’t
riot
or
tension
in
the
prison.
and
in
fact,
does
that
usually
mean
the
right
to
interview
a
celebrity.
interview
a
jimmy
hoffa,
phillip
berrigan,
or
to
interview
a
disruptive
inmate
who
has
just
made
the
news
because
he’s
lead
a
work
stoppage
or
a
riot.
and
it
is
the
latter
of
course
is
particularly
troublesome
because
that
man
becomes
a
leader
by
leading
a
trouble
and
then
by
broadcasting
his
inflammatory
charges
direct
to
the
press.
and
hardly
enough,
the
very
rule
of
respondents
are
arguing
for
would
cut-off
access
to
that
man
as
soon
he
did
it,
because
he
would
become
the
disruptive
figure.
so,
i
think
the
rule
you
are
asking
for
is
really
not
a
rule
that
makes
a
great
deal
of
sense
from
anybody’s
worth.
it
ought
to
be
said
that
it
is
very
odd
to
claim
this
kind
of
right
of
access
in
the
prison
context.
the
maximum
and
medium
security
prisons
constitute
the
most
tensed,
volatile,
violence-prone
society
i
suppose
on
the
face
of
the
earth.
the
bureau
of
prison
simply
cannot
maintain
discipline
and
effect
rehabilitation,
which
they
have
done
with
increasing
effect
of
us.
if
press
interviews
are
permitted
to
create
or
maintain
disruptive
inmate
leaders,
that
much
is
conceded
by
the
courts
are
blown
and
apparently
by
the
respondents.
but
they
think
a
case-by-case
approach
will
cure
it,
i
don’t
think
so
i
think
it
would
damage
rehabilitation
or
harm
discipline.
in
the
first
place,
there
is
inherent
discrimination
between
inmates.
the
man
who
is
disruptive
who
they
alienated
who
is
hostile
will
not
be
allowed
to
have
interviews,
while
man
who
says
more
pleasant
things
will
be
not
because
the
warden
is
trying
to
control
contents
but
you
do
get
a
control
of
content
when
you
say
the
disruptive
hostile
alienated
man
cannot
speak
to
everyone.
and
you
also
get
tension
and
unhappiness
as
between
prisoners.
furthermore,
wardens
are
going
to
be
required
to
guess
under
this
new
policy
about
who
is
likely
to
be
dangerous.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
at
the
court
of
appeals
policy,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
suggests
they
have
to
have
some
past
experience
with
this
man
to
believe
that
he
is
disruptive.
well,
they
may
have
a
subjective
feeling
that
he
is
disruptive
and
he
may
be
quite
right.
but
they
are
going
to
be
required
to
guess,
sometimes
they
are
going
to
guess
wrong,
and
you
may
have
seriously
harmful
even
tragic
results.
and
i
would
add
this,
even
if
a
notorious
inmate
proves
not
disruptive
within
the
prison.
it
seems
to
me
that
constant
press
attention
which
could
not
be
denied
then
if
he
was
not
disruptive
is
totally
inconsistent
with
the
idea
of
an
opportunity
for
penitence
and
for
rehabilitation.
a
man
who
is
--
becomes
the
object
of
the
press
and
his
opinions
are
cited
everywhere
is
not
likely
to
repent.
he
will
maintain
his
status
and
come
out
of
the
prison.
i
was
thinking
once
the
same
condition
at
least
that’s
what
director
of
prisons
thinks.
finally,
i
will
suggest
that
there’ll
be
increase
litigation.
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
suggest
we
have
to
have
certain
kinds
of
experience,
it
didn’t
order
to
deny
an
interview,
i
think
we’re
going
to
have
let
the
case
made
or
record
made
and
we
are
going
to
be
at
the
courts
all
the
time,
and
that’s
a
heavy
administrative
burden.
i
will
say
one
last
word.
i
think
the
first
amendment
itself
cuts
against
this
case-by-case
policy.
if
the
press
has
full
access
to
the
prisons,
we
are
going
to
have
to
decide,
who
is
the
press?
now,
respondent
say,
you’ve
already
done
that,
you
have
a
definition
of
the
press.
that
was
a
definition
adopted
as
a
matter
of
administrative
discretion
about
constitutional
pressure.
once
it
is
stated
that
the
definition
is
controlled
by
the
constitution
then
we
have
a
government
official.
in
the
first
instance
a
warden
of
a
penitentiary
deciding
who
qualifies
as
the
press
and
who
does
not.
that
becomes
something
like
an
official
licensing
policy
if
made
under
the
first
amendment,
and
i
think
that’s
a
concept,
its
an
(inaudible)
to
the
first
amendment.
we
submit
in
short
that
the
considerations
of
the
first
amendment,
consideration
to
the
prison
context,
considerations
of
the
deference
due
to
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
suggest
that
the
case
be
reversed,
and
that
the
director
be
allowed
to
go
forward
under
the
policy
statement
is
promulgated.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
just
rise
to
note
that
the
federal
--
we
here
about
the
white-collar
prisoners.
the
federal
prisons
in
fact
are
not
staff
entirely
by
white-collar
criminal
who
just
violated
the
antitrust
laws
systemwide.
50%
of
the
prisoners
are
convicted
of
crimes
of
serious
violence
against
the
person
on
major
narcotics
traffickers
who
are
also
regardless
of
violence
threat
in
the
prison.
those
numbers
are
much
higher
in
the
maximum
and
medium
security
prisoners.
we
are
dealing
with
a
dangerous
and
notable
population.
the
testimony
of
the
wardens
below
--
the
federal
wardens
said
that
they
perceived
on
the
experience
of
the
states.
we
have
the
experience
of
california
which
states
it
proceeded.
they
perceived
that
this
kind
of
interview
was
quite
troublesome
so
that
of
course
they
have
to
rehabilitate
and
to
maintain
order.
it
is
always
difficult
to
link
one
event
with
the
result
in
human
activity.
there
best
judgment
is
that
there
is
such
a
link,
california’s
best
judgment
isn’t
the
reason
to
make.
i
think
that’s
a
judgment
they
are
entitled
to
make.
