mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
clear.
it
is
--
the
question
is
does
a
reporter
for
a
newspaper,
washington
post
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
interview
a
prison
inmate
when
that
inmate
is
willing
to
be
interviewed
and
the
interview
presents
no
serious
risk
of
administrative
or
disciplinary
problems
to
the
prison?
and
secondly,
there
is
no
need
to
speculate
as
i
believe
the
solicitor
general
has
done
in
many
of
his
remarks
this
morning
as
to
correctional
problems
as
to
the
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
that
the
particular
interview
presents
no
serious
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
mr.
justice,
we
have
in
the
record
the
testimony
from
several
wardens
including
the
federal
prison
wardens,
including
state
prison
wardens,
19
states
whose
prison
populations
as
the
record
indicates
in
this
case
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
there
is
a
problem.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
there
is
a
problem.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
with
respect
to
that
problem
why
we’re
on
it,
i
would
note
that
we
do
have
in
this
record
testimony
from
those
wardens.
we
do
have
in
this
record,
the
fact
that
19
of
the
24
american
jurisdictions
whose
regulations
--
who
have
regulations
that
are
introduced
in
the
record,
or
may
be
the
press
interviews
on
a
virtually
without
exception,
or
on
a
discretionary
basis.
and
we
now
have
a
situation
in
which
the
warden,
at
least
that
the
lesser
secure
prisons
of
the
federal
government
will
have
to
make
discretionary
judgments
because
presumably
in
times
of
emergency,
or
in
times
of
particular
individual
disciplinary
problems
they
will
not
permit
a
particular
interview.
that
change
in
policy,
i
believes
--
believe
makes
relevant
to
the
bureau
of
prison’s
policy
with
respect
to
the
way
man
are
assigned
to
the
various
prisons
of
the
bureau
of
prisons,
and
that
is
their
policy
statement
7300.13
(c).
i
would
simply
note
for
this
court
that
of
the
many,
many
reasons
listed
as
to
why
individuals
are
assigned
only
one
or
two
of
them
deal
with
security
problems.
they
deal
with
hospital
care,
the
availability
of
training
programs
whether
prisons
are
overcrowded,
whether
they
are
close
to
the
home
of
the
particular
inmate
involved.
so
i
would
hardly
consider
the
rational
distinction
in
the
context
of
a
first
amendment
right.
and
lastly,
i
would
note
that
the
record
contains
the
fact
that
the
federal
prison
population
is
not
a
highly
valuable-tensed
prison
population
as
the
solicitor
general
speculated,
but
that
the
bulk
of
the
individuals
in
federal
prisons
are
there
for
white
collar
crimes.
that’s
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
i
think
that
some
of
them
are.
we
were
just
informed
of
this
policy
on
friday
when
we’re
informed
they
would
cover
13
institutions,
and
then
we
were
given
a
list
of
this
institution
to
suggest
that
they
went,
the
list
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
--
was
increased
to
that
20.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
there
is
testimony
in
our
record
as
to
how
individuals
are
assigned
surely
the
more
dangerous
people
are
assigned
to
the
maximum
security.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
but
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
that’s
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
i
say
there
are
no
problems
when
we
are
talking
about
75%
of
the
federal
prison
population,
which
will
still
be
subject
to
this
total
ban.
i
say
that
there
are
no
problems,
serious
enough
to
justify
a
total
ban.
if
there
are
problems
at
a
particular
institution
at
a
particular
time
because
it
is
on
a
high
state
of
tension,
or
because
there
is
disruption
there,
we
recognize
that
the
first
amendment
values
have
to
be
weighed
at
those
times
and
that
the
warden
can
make
a
judgment
as
the
court,
both
courts
below
did
that
there
would
not
be
appropriate
for
an
interview.
if
there
is
a
problem
with
a
particular
inmate,
we
recognize
that
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
have
an
interview
under
circumstances
in
which
he
is
a
disciplinary
problem.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
but
we
have
testimony
in
the
record.
i
would
note
that
terra
haute,
which
is
a
maximum
security
prison.
warden
aldrich
testified
that
only
at
the
top
10%
of
the
prisoners
of
terra
haute,
the
maximum
security
prison
could
be
regarded
as
troublemakers,
and
of
that,
and
then
at
most
5%
would
be
entitled
to
this
sort
of
nebulous
majority
of
the
“big
wheel”,
so
that
80%
of
those
prisoners
that
are
not
a
problem.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
the
district
court
would
then
decide,
i
would
simply
note
that
in
all
the
cases
cited
by
the
solicitor
general
by
us,
in
our
case,
and
the
other
case
that
this
court
heard
prior
to
ours,
that
all
the
litigation
deals
with
the
total
ban.
that
with
one
exception,
there
is
not
a
single
case
that
i
am
aware
of
that
deals
with
any
of
the
19
jurisdictions
that
were
introduced
in
the
record
of
the
29
jurisdictions
in
fact
that
have
discretionary
policies,
or
generally
admit
the
permit
interviews.
so,
what
i
think
that
the
litigation
point
is
not
a
point
of
serious
concern.
i
would
note
that
in
the
context
of
our
record
and
the
evidence
it
was
submitted
on
the
findings
of
the
court
below,
all
virtually,
all
of
the
evidence
deals
with
maximum
and
minimum
security
prisons.
those
are
the
wardens
who
testified,
those
are
the
wardens
who
testified
on
our
behalf.
we
submit
that
it
is
our
point
that
under
branzburg
and
hayes,
the
news
gathering
was
firmly
hitched
to
the
first
amendment
by
all
nine
justices
and
by
all
opinions
in
that
case.
and
that
in
that
case,
the
court
applied
to
news
gathering,
the
same
kinds
of
tests
that
is
was
applied
to
the
right
to
publish
and
other
protections
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment.
namely
that
the
infringement
of
the
protective
first
amendment
rights
must
be
no
broader
than
necessary
to
perceive,
to
achieve
a
permissible
governmental
purpose,
and
secondly,
that
a
state’s
interest
must
be
compelling
or
paramount
to
justify
even
an
indirect
burden
on
first
amendment
rights.
and
we
think
that
the
--
in
this
case,
in
which
the
government
had
two
hearings,
two
opportunities
to
present
evidence
that
they
clearly
did
not
establish
that
kind
of
a
governmental
interest.
we
also
believe
as
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
found
that
the
record
provides
substantial
evidence,
and
uncontroverted
testimony
that
face-to-face
personal
interviews
are
not
simply
another
technique,
but
that
they
are
essential
to
effective
news
gathering
in
the
situation.
the
bureau
of
prisons’
method
of
permitting
an
exchange
of
letters
with
the
prisoner’s
letters
to
the
reporter
not
examined.
but
to
reporters’
letter
to
the
prisoner
examined
for
contraband
and
for
content,
which
would
incite
a
legal
conduct
is
patently
inadequate
as
far
as
the
press
is
concerned,
and
if
we
think
as
far
as
first
amendment
values
are
concerned.
the
reporter
has
no
opportunity
to
test
the
credibility
of
the
prisoner
or
to
follow
up
in
his
questioning.
indeed,
he
does
not
have
the
assurance
that
the
prisoner
who
is
signing
the
signature
block
at
that
letter
is
the
prisoner
who
is
answering
the
questions
he
is
writing
to
him
about.
we
all
know
that
in
prison
life,
one
prisoner
writes
for
another,
one
prisoner
answers
and
helps
other
prisoners
answer
questions.
and
i
would
note
that
such
a
policy
makes
an
assumption
that
prisoners
and
inmates
can
read
and
write
clearly.
and
as
the
chief
justice
has
noted
the
percentage
of
inmates
in
all
institutions
who
cannot
read
or
write
is
staggering.
we
think
the
public
interest
in
learning
about
prisons
weighs
heavily
on
the
first
amendment
scales,
and
they
are
with
simply
note
that
with
there
are
more
than
1.5
million
americans
in
prison
in
this
nation
on
any
given
day.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
in
incarceration.
in
incarceration
or
jails
on
any
given
day,
that
the
annual
bill
for
american
taxpayers
of
the
federal
state
in
local
level
now
exceeds
$1
billion
dollars
for
prisons.
and
that
the
projective
fiscal
1975
budget
for
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
alone
is
more
than
one
quarter
of
a
billion
dollars.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
we
think
your
honor
that
the
public,
the
fact
that
this
are
public
institutions
that
the
taxpayers
of
this
country
are
paying
for
them
that
they
are
a
significant
part
of
our
government
is
a
weight
in
the
scale
of
the
right
of
the
public
to
know
about
what’s
going
on
in
our
prisons.
we
think
that
the
right
of
the
press
here
is
essentially
their
right,
as
surrogates
of
the
public
to
inform
the
public,
and
that
that
should
weigh
in
the
scales.
we
believe
that
the
record
in
this
case,
which
i
said,
puts
as
in
the
position
of
not
having
to
speculate
does
not
justify
a
government
sweeping
ban
of
the
kind
that
here
exist.
i
mentioned
the
warden
aldrich’s
comments
about
terra
haute.
i
would
mentioned
that
all
warden
directors
who
testified
on
the
issue
of
“big
wheels”,
wardens
aldrich
and
directors
wainwright
and
bensinger,
in
the
court
below
all
testified
that
“big
wheels”
come
in
to
prison
“big
wheels”
or
become
“big
wheels”
in
prison
whether
or
not
they
are
interviewed
that
what
is
involved
here
is
a
kind
of
negative
leadership
function.
they
also
noted
that
the
prison
officials
are
easily
able
to
identify
the
disruptive
prisoner.
particularly
in
the
federal
prison
system
for
the
reasons
that
are
mentioned
by
the
chief
justice
in
the
context
of
the
testing
that
now
is
on
the
more
sophisticated
psychological
and
aptitude
testing,
that
now
goes
on
in
prisoners.
we
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
significant
evidence
in
this
record
which
indicates
that
press
interviews
creates
disturbances
at
prisons.
there
were
three
items
of
testimony
in
this
area,
in
this
case
and
one
related
to
the
warden
or
the
head
of
the
state
correctional
system.
in
iowa,
mr.
brewer,
he
testified
that
during
a
period
of
tension,
he
was
overruled
by
the
governor
who
ordered
him
to
permit
press
interviews
and
that
these
increase
the
tension
in
this
institution.
there
were
still
no
violence
at
that
institution,
i
might
note,
and
moreover,
iowa
still
has
a
discretionary
interview
policy.
in
the
other
--
the
other
instance
mentioned
was
in
the
state
of
florida
in
which
a
warden
from
the
state
of
florida
said
that
some
articles
that
were
written
created
tension
in
florida
four
months
later
where
there
was
violence.
i
think
the
causation
when
this
court
looks
at
the
record,
the
causation
is
highly
tenuous,
and
the
warden
admitted
that
there
were
severe
racial
tension
problems
in
his
prison
before
any
press
interviews
or
articles
actually
were
written.
in
the
context
of
the
questions
that
have
been
raised
by
this
court,
i
think
in
the
context
and
attempt
to
define
the
press,
i
do
not
consider
that
a
difficult
problem.
the
press
is
defined
in
many,
many
ways
and
if
the
solicitor
general
is
concerned
about
how
the
press
is
defined,
he
should
be
concerned
about
the
fact
that
it’s
defined
by
every
department
of
this
government.
everyday,
the
justice
department
has
regulations
defining
what
the
press
is,
who
is
entitled
to
use
their
press
facilities,
who
is
entitled
to
go
in
there.
there
are
press
definitions
here
and
this
is
not
proposed
in
the
bureau
of
prisons,
which
are
in
existence
in
the
bureau
of
prisons
policy.
this
is
not
a
situation
like
branzburg
where
we
have
an
inherently
unlimited
number
of
people
that
might
claim
to
be
reporters.
in
the
branzburg
case,
any
individual
at
any
given
point
of
time
might
claim
to
be
a
reporter,
claim
to
be
entitled
of
the
first
amendment
rights,
and
therefore
create
a
problem
in
terms
of
investigation
by
the
grand
jury
where
it
witness
a
crime.
we
don’t
have
that
situation
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
there
is
a
recognition
by
the
press
that
there
has
to
be
some
--
it
has
to
be
reasonable
judgments
made
as
they
are
made
everyday
by
this
court,
and
who
sits
in
its
own
press
box.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
i
think
in
the
--
those
judgments
would
have
to
be
made
by
the
warden
in
the
institution.
that’s
what
we
would
suggest
to
other
chief
in
the
bureau
of
prisons.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
i
think
in
cases
of
severe
abuse,
they
would
be
but
i
think
that
--
i
mean
the
right
--
the
first
amendment
right
is
a
personal
right,
but
it
is
not
an
absolute
right.
it
is
subject
to
reasonable
regulation.
that’s
recognized
in
case
after
case
by
this
court,
and
one
of
the
implications
of
as
this
for
example,
is
that
there
will
be
a
limited
number
of
reporters
in
the
courtroom
during
a
trial.
and
i
do
not
think
that
that
means
that
all
reporters
should
at
everyone
who
ever
claims
to
be
a
reporter
or
every
reporter
for
every
established
newspaper,
or
everyone
should
be
banned
from
having
interview,
personal
interviews
with
pre-identified
inmates.
i
would
note
that
it
is
not
simply
a
situation
where
the
--
where
we
can
speculate
that
the
press
will
always
want
to
interview
the
man
creating
the
disturbance
or
always
want
to
interview
jimmy
hopper.
surely,
they
want
to
interview
poeple
that
are
celebrities,
for
example
on
television
saturday
night
in
cbs
had
an
interview
with
budd
crowe,
who
is
out
in
allan
wood
at
a
time
when
the
policy
prohibited
personal
interviews
and
there
he
was
photographed
for
10
minutes.
but
mr.
bagdikian
in
the
record
of
this
case
was
not
after
people
who
had
created
a
disturbance.
he
was
not
after
celebrities.
he
was
after
group
of
people
who
have
been
selected
to
sit
on
a
negotiating
committee
with
the
prison
officials
after
a
non-violent
demonstration
at
lewisburg
and
at
danbury.
and
he
wanted
to
find
out
as
the
record
shows,
why
the
problems
were
resolved
in
those
prisons
non-violently?
how
that
came
about?
he
was
not
after
the
“big
wheel”
if
you
will
or
the
major
celebrity.
my
own
closing
with
respect
to
this
is
that
the
--
as
far
as
the
washington
post
and
mr.
bagdikian
is
concerned
and
as
our
brief
reflects.
it
is
our
firm
conviction
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
prisons
are
in
the
condition
that
they
are
in
today,
the
condition
that’s
been
described
by
the
chief
justice
many,
many
times
is,
because
the
first
amendment
has
not
been
permitted
to
operate.
the
way
it
operates
on
government,
the
way
it
operates
in
schools,
the
way
it
operates
in
virtually
every
other
facet
of
our
society.
the
first
amendment
has
not
been
permitted
to
let
a
little
sunshine
in
to
those
prisons,
and
let
the
reporters
whose
right
becomes
even
more
critical
when
the
average
american,
when
the
citizen
cannot
walk
through
every
prison
in
interview,
every
prisoner
he
desires,
and
let
them
go
in
to
the
prisons
and
get
the
story
of
the
prisons
out.
the
first
amendment
is
part
of
that
process.
i
can
understand
as
any
one
can
that
this
policy
is
very
convenient
and
very
helpful
for
the
warden,
administrators,
wardens
and
administrators
in
the
bureau
of
prison
system.
there
isn’t
a
single
member
running
in
united
states
government
department
or
bureau,
or
court,
or
university,
or
anything
in
this
country,
or
military
base
that
would
not
be
delighted
to
have
a
regulation
that
prohibited
interviews
in
this
context.
but
that’s
not
what
are
system
is
all
about,
and
that’s
not
what
the
first
amendment
is
all
about.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
clear.
it
is
--
the
question
is
does
a
reporter
for
a
newspaper,
washington
post
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
interview
a
prison
inmate
when
that
inmate
is
willing
to
be
interviewed
and
the
interview
presents
no
serious
risk
of
administrative
or
disciplinary
problems
to
the
prison?
and
secondly,
there
is
no
need
to
speculate
as
i
believe
the
solicitor
general
has
done
in
many
of
his
remarks
this
morning
as
to
correctional
problems
as
to
the
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
that
the
particular
interview
presents
no
serious
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
mr.
justice,
we
have
in
the
record
the
testimony
from
several
wardens
including
the
federal
prison
wardens,
including
state
prison
wardens,
19
states
whose
prison
populations
as
the
record
indicates
in
this
case
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
there
is
a
problem.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
there
is
a
problem.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
with
respect
to
that
problem
why
we’re
on
it,
i
would
note
that
we
do
have
in
this
record
testimony
from
those
wardens.
we
do
have
in
this
record,
the
fact
that
19
of
the
24
american
jurisdictions
whose
regulations
--
who
have
regulations
that
are
introduced
in
the
record,
or
may
be
the
press
interviews
on
a
virtually
without
exception,
or
on
a
discretionary
basis.
and
we
now
have
a
situation
in
which
the
warden,
at
least
that
the
lesser
secure
prisons
of
the
federal
government
will
have
to
make
discretionary
judgments
because
presumably
in
times
of
emergency,
or
in
times
of
particular
individual
disciplinary
problems
they
will
not
permit
a
particular
interview.
that
change
in
policy,
i
believes
--
believe
makes
relevant
to
the
bureau
of
prison’s
policy
with
respect
to
the
way
man
are
assigned
to
the
various
prisons
of
the
bureau
of
prisons,
and
that
is
their
policy
statement
7300.13
(c).
i
would
simply
note
for
this
court
that
of
the
many,
many
reasons
listed
as
to
why
individuals
are
assigned
only
one
or
two
of
them
deal
with
security
problems.
they
deal
with
hospital
care,
the
availability
of
training
programs
whether
prisons
are
overcrowded,
whether
they
are
close
to
the
home
of
the
particular
inmate
involved.
so
i
would
hardly
consider
the
rational
distinction
in
the
context
of
a
first
amendment
right.
and
lastly,
i
would
note
that
the
record
contains
the
fact
that
the
federal
prison
population
is
not
a
highly
valuable-tensed
prison
population
as
the
solicitor
general
speculated,
but
that
the
bulk
of
the
individuals
in
federal
prisons
are
there
for
white
collar
crimes.
that’s
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
i
think
that
some
of
them
are.
we
were
just
informed
of
this
policy
on
friday
when
we’re
informed
they
would
cover
13
institutions,
and
then
we
were
given
a
list
of
this
institution
to
suggest
that
they
went,
the
list
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
--
was
increased
to
that
20.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
there
is
testimony
in
our
record
as
to
how
individuals
are
assigned
surely
the
more
dangerous
people
are
assigned
to
the
maximum
security.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
but
--
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
that’s
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
i
say
there
are
no
problems
when
we
are
talking
about
75%
of
the
federal
prison
population,
which
will
still
be
subject
to
this
total
ban.
i
say
that
there
are
no
problems,
serious
enough
to
justify
a
total
ban.
if
there
are
problems
at
a
particular
institution
at
a
particular
time
because
it
is
on
a
high
state
of
tension,
or
because
there
is
disruption
there,
we
recognize
that
the
first
amendment
values
have
to
be
weighed
at
those
times
and
that
the
warden
can
make
a
judgment
as
the
court,
both
courts
below
did
that
there
would
not
be
appropriate
for
an
interview.
if
there
is
a
problem
with
a
particular
inmate,
we
recognize
that
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
have
an
interview
under
circumstances
in
which
he
is
a
disciplinary
problem.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
but
we
have
testimony
in
the
record.
i
would
note
that
terra
haute,
which
is
a
maximum
security
prison.
warden
aldrich
testified
that
only
at
the
top
10%
of
the
prisoners
of
terra
haute,
the
maximum
security
prison
could
be
regarded
as
troublemakers,
and
of
that,
and
then
at
most
5%
would
be
entitled
to
this
sort
of
nebulous
majority
of
the
“big
wheel”,
so
that
80%
of
those
prisoners
that
are
not
a
problem.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
the
district
court
would
then
decide,
i
would
simply
note
that
in
all
the
cases
cited
by
the
solicitor
general
by
us,
in
our
case,
and
the
other
case
that
this
court
heard
prior
to
ours,
that
all
the
litigation
deals
with
the
total
ban.
that
with
one
exception,
there
is
not
a
single
case
that
i
am
aware
of
that
deals
with
any
of
the
19
jurisdictions
that
were
introduced
in
the
record
of
the
29
jurisdictions
in
fact
that
have
discretionary
policies,
or
generally
admit
the
permit
interviews.
so,
what
i
think
that
the
litigation
point
is
not
a
point
of
serious
concern.
i
would
note
that
in
the
context
of
our
record
and
the
evidence
it
was
submitted
on
the
findings
of
the
court
below,
all
virtually,
all
of
the
evidence
deals
with
maximum
and
minimum
security
prisons.
those
are
the
wardens
who
testified,
those
are
the
wardens
who
testified
on
our
behalf.
we
submit
that
it
is
our
point
that
under
branzburg
and
hayes,
the
news
gathering
was
firmly
hitched
to
the
first
amendment
by
all
nine
justices
and
by
all
opinions
in
that
case.
and
that
in
that
case,
the
court
applied
to
news
gathering,
the
same
kinds
of
tests
that
is
was
applied
to
the
right
to
publish
and
other
protections
guaranteed
by
the
first
amendment.
namely
that
the
infringement
of
the
protective
first
amendment
rights
must
be
no
broader
than
necessary
to
perceive,
to
achieve
a
permissible
governmental
purpose,
and
secondly,
that
a
state’s
interest
must
be
compelling
or
paramount
to
justify
even
an
indirect
burden
on
first
amendment
rights.
and
we
think
that
the
--
in
this
case,
in
which
the
government
had
two
hearings,
two
opportunities
to
present
evidence
that
they
clearly
did
not
establish
that
kind
of
a
governmental
interest.
we
also
believe
as
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
district
court
found
that
the
record
provides
substantial
evidence,
and
uncontroverted
testimony
that
face-to-face
personal
interviews
are
not
simply
another
technique,
but
that
they
are
essential
to
effective
news
gathering
in
the
situation.
the
bureau
of
prisons’
method
of
permitting
an
exchange
of
letters
with
the
prisoner’s
letters
to
the
reporter
not
examined.
but
to
reporters’
letter
to
the
prisoner
examined
for
contraband
and
for
content,
which
would
incite
a
legal
conduct
is
patently
inadequate
as
far
as
the
press
is
concerned,
and
if
we
think
as
far
as
first
amendment
values
are
concerned.
the
reporter
has
no
opportunity
to
test
the
credibility
of
the
prisoner
or
to
follow
up
in
his
questioning.
indeed,
he
does
not
have
the
assurance
that
the
prisoner
who
is
signing
the
signature
block
at
that
letter
is
the
prisoner
who
is
answering
the
questions
he
is
writing
to
him
about.
we
all
know
that
in
prison
life,
one
prisoner
writes
for
another,
one
prisoner
answers
and
helps
other
prisoners
answer
questions.
and
i
would
note
that
such
a
policy
makes
an
assumption
that
prisoners
and
inmates
can
read
and
write
clearly.
and
as
the
chief
justice
has
noted
the
percentage
of
inmates
in
all
institutions
who
cannot
read
or
write
is
staggering.
we
think
the
public
interest
in
learning
about
prisons
weighs
heavily
on
the
first
amendment
scales,
and
they
are
with
simply
note
that
with
there
are
more
than
1.5
million
americans
in
prison
in
this
nation
on
any
given
day.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
in
incarceration.
in
incarceration
or
jails
on
any
given
day,
that
the
annual
bill
for
american
taxpayers
of
the
federal
state
in
local
level
now
exceeds
$1
billion
dollars
for
prisons.
and
that
the
projective
fiscal
1975
budget
for
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
alone
is
more
than
one
quarter
of
a
billion
dollars.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
we
think
your
honor
that
the
public,
the
fact
that
this
are
public
institutions
that
the
taxpayers
of
this
country
are
paying
for
them
that
they
are
a
significant
part
of
our
government
is
a
weight
in
the
scale
of
the
right
of
the
public
to
know
about
what’s
going
on
in
our
prisons.
we
think
that
the
right
of
the
press
here
is
essentially
their
right,
as
surrogates
of
the
public
to
inform
the
public,
and
that
that
should
weigh
in
the
scales.
we
believe
that
the
record
in
this
case,
which
i
said,
puts
as
in
the
position
of
not
having
to
speculate
does
not
justify
a
government
sweeping
ban
of
the
kind
that
here
exist.
i
mentioned
the
warden
aldrich’s
comments
about
terra
haute.
i
would
mentioned
that
all
warden
directors
who
testified
on
the
issue
of
“big
wheels”,
wardens
aldrich
and
directors
wainwright
and
bensinger,
in
the
court
below
all
testified
that
“big
wheels”
come
in
to
prison
“big
wheels”
or
become
“big
wheels”
in
prison
whether
or
not
they
are
interviewed
that
what
is
involved
here
is
a
kind
of
negative
leadership
function.
they
also
noted
that
the
prison
officials
are
easily
able
to
identify
the
disruptive
prisoner.
particularly
in
the
federal
prison
system
for
the
reasons
that
are
mentioned
by
the
chief
justice
in
the
context
of
the
testing
that
now
is
on
the
more
sophisticated
psychological
and
aptitude
testing,
that
now
goes
on
in
prisoners.
we
do
not
think
that
there
is
any
significant
evidence
in
this
record
which
indicates
that
press
interviews
creates
disturbances
at
prisons.
there
were
three
items
of
testimony
in
this
area,
in
this
case
and
one
related
to
the
warden
or
the
head
of
the
state
correctional
system.
in
iowa,
mr.
brewer,
he
testified
that
during
a
period
of
tension,
he
was
overruled
by
the
governor
who
ordered
him
to
permit
press
interviews
and
that
these
increase
the
tension
in
this
institution.
there
were
still
no
violence
at
that
institution,
i
might
note,
and
moreover,
iowa
still
has
a
discretionary
interview
policy.
in
the
other
--
the
other
instance
mentioned
was
in
the
state
of
florida
in
which
a
warden
from
the
state
of
florida
said
that
some
articles
that
were
written
created
tension
in
florida
four
months
later
where
there
was
violence.
i
think
the
causation
when
this
court
looks
at
the
record,
the
causation
is
highly
tenuous,
and
the
warden
admitted
that
there
were
severe
racial
tension
problems
in
his
prison
before
any
press
interviews
or
articles
actually
were
written.
in
the
context
of
the
questions
that
have
been
raised
by
this
court,
i
think
in
the
context
and
attempt
to
define
the
press,
i
do
not
consider
that
a
difficult
problem.
the
press
is
defined
in
many,
many
ways
and
if
the
solicitor
general
is
concerned
about
how
the
press
is
defined,
he
should
be
concerned
about
the
fact
that
it’s
defined
by
every
department
of
this
government.
everyday,
the
justice
department
has
regulations
defining
what
the
press
is,
who
is
entitled
to
use
their
press
facilities,
who
is
entitled
to
go
in
there.
there
are
press
definitions
here
and
this
is
not
proposed
in
the
bureau
of
prisons,
which
are
in
existence
in
the
bureau
of
prisons
policy.
this
is
not
a
situation
like
branzburg
where
we
have
an
inherently
unlimited
number
of
people
that
might
claim
to
be
reporters.
in
the
branzburg
case,
any
individual
at
any
given
point
of
time
might
claim
to
be
a
reporter,
claim
to
be
entitled
of
the
first
amendment
rights,
and
therefore
create
a
problem
in
terms
of
investigation
by
the
grand
jury
where
it
witness
a
crime.
we
don’t
have
that
situation
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
there
is
a
recognition
by
the
press
that
there
has
to
be
some
--
it
has
to
be
reasonable
judgments
made
as
they
are
made
everyday
by
this
court,
and
who
sits
in
its
own
press
box.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
i
think
in
the
--
those
judgments
would
have
to
be
made
by
the
warden
in
the
institution.
that’s
what
we
would
suggest
to
other
chief
in
the
bureau
of
prisons.
mr.
joseph
a.
califano,
jr.
i
think
in
cases
of
severe
abuse,
they
would
be
but
i
think
that
--
i
mean
the
right
--
the
first
amendment
right
is
a
personal
right,
but
it
is
not
an
absolute
right.
it
is
subject
to
reasonable
regulation.
that’s
recognized
in
case
after
case
by
this
court,
and
one
of
the
implications
of
as
this
for
example,
is
that
there
will
be
a
limited
number
of
reporters
in
the
courtroom
during
a
trial.
and
i
do
not
think
that
that
means
that
all
reporters
should
at
everyone
who
ever
claims
to
be
a
reporter
or
every
reporter
for
every
established
newspaper,
or
everyone
should
be
banned
from
having
interview,
personal
interviews
with
pre-identified
inmates.
i
would
note
that
it
is
not
simply
a
situation
where
the
--
where
we
can
speculate
that
the
press
will
always
want
to
interview
the
man
creating
the
disturbance
or
always
want
to
interview
jimmy
hopper.
surely,
they
want
to
interview
poeple
that
are
celebrities,
for
example
on
television
saturday
night
in
cbs
had
an
interview
with
budd
crowe,
who
is
out
in
allan
wood
at
a
time
when
the
policy
prohibited
personal
interviews
and
there
he
was
photographed
for
10
minutes.
but
mr.
bagdikian
in
the
record
of
this
case
was
not
after
people
who
had
created
a
disturbance.
he
was
not
after
celebrities.
he
was
after
group
of
people
who
have
been
selected
to
sit
on
a
negotiating
committee
with
the
prison
officials
after
a
non-violent
demonstration
at
lewisburg
and
at
danbury.
and
he
wanted
to
find
out
as
the
record
shows,
why
the
problems
were
resolved
in
those
prisons
non-violently?
how
that
came
about?
he
was
not
after
the
“big
wheel”
if
you
will
or
the
major
celebrity.
my
own
closing
with
respect
to
this
is
that
the
--
as
far
as
the
washington
post
and
mr.
bagdikian
is
concerned
and
as
our
brief
reflects.
it
is
our
firm
conviction
that
one
of
the
reasons
why
prisons
are
in
the
condition
that
they
are
in
today,
the
condition
that’s
been
described
by
the
chief
justice
many,
many
times
is,
because
the
first
amendment
has
not
been
permitted
to
operate.
the
way
it
operates
on
government,
the
way
it
operates
in
schools,
the
way
it
operates
in
virtually
every
other
facet
of
our
society.
the
first
amendment
has
not
been
permitted
to
let
a
little
sunshine
in
to
those
prisons,
and
let
the
reporters
whose
right
becomes
even
more
critical
when
the
average
american,
when
the
citizen
cannot
walk
through
every
prison
in
interview,
every
prisoner
he
desires,
and
let
them
go
in
to
the
prisons
and
get
the
story
of
the
prisons
out.
the
first
amendment
is
part
of
that
process.
i
can
understand
as
any
one
can
that
this
policy
is
very
convenient
and
very
helpful
for
the
warden,
administrators,
wardens
and
administrators
in
the
bureau
of
prison
system.
there
isn’t
a
single
member
running
in
united
states
government
department
or
bureau,
or
court,
or
university,
or
anything
in
this
country,
or
military
base
that
would
not
be
delighted
to
have
a
regulation
that
prohibited
interviews
in
this
context.
but
that’s
not
what
are
system
is
all
about,
and
that’s
not
what
the
first
amendment
is
all
about.
thank
you.
