well,
what
if
the
respondent
had
sold
the
bonds
to
third
parties,
gotten
cash
from
them,
and
used
the
cash
to
redeem
the
preferred
stock?
justice

rehnquist
mr.
hess,
in
the
real
world
of
finance,
are
there
many
debentures
with
the
face
value
of
$50
that
you
would
market
for
$25?
i
mean,
is
this
something
that
happens
with
any
frequency?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
a
$5
discount,
say
$50
or
$45
or
$30,
has
just
really
a
very
insignificant
effect
on
the
stated
interest
rate
if
$17
would
have
that
small?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
government
put
in
any
evidence
contradicting
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn’t
make
any
difference?
