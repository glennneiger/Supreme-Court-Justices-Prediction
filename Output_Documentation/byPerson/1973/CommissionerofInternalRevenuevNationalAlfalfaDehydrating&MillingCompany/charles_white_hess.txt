mr.
charles
white
hess
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
charles
hess.
i’m
an
attorney
from
kansas
city,
missouri
and
with
the
firm
of
lindy,
thompson,
van
dike,
fairchild,
and
langworthy.
we
have
represented
the
respondent
national
alfalfa
dehydrating
and
milling
co.
for
many
years
and
have
represented
them
throughout
this
litigation.
mr.
smith’s
presentation
of
the
facts
has
been
relatively
accurate.
however,
we
cannot
agree
with
the
facts
which
he
emphasizes
nor
with
his
characterization
of
the
redemption
or
exchange
transaction
which
occurred
in
this
case
as
a
substitution
of
securities.
in
its
simplest
form,
national
alfalfa
issued
a
$50
face
amount
5%
debt
obligation,
repayable
in
18
years
to
its
preferred
shared
holders
in
exchange
for
or
redemption
of
each
share
of
their
preferred
stock
which
had
a
fair
market
value
of
$33
at
the
date
of
the
exchange.
the
preferred
share
holders
retained
no
further
equity
interest
in
the
corporation.
the
economic
reality
surrounding
the
exchange,
which
are
substantiated
in
the
record,
dictated
that
the
issue
price
of
each
debenture
was
$33
or
the
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred
stock.
and,
that
the
difference
of
$17
between
the
face
amount
of
the
debenture
and
its
issue
price
of
$33
represent
a
discount.
the
economic
facts
surrounding
the
transaction
which
dictated
that
$33
was
the
true
and
meaningful
value
to
be
attributed
to
the
issue
price
of
the
debentures
are
numerous.
the
preferred
stock
for
which
each
debenture
was
issued
had
a
fair
market
value
in
the
over-the-counter
market
of
$33
per
share.
seventeen
--
mr.
charles
white
hess
yes,
it
was
a
stipulated
fact
in
the
tax
court.
mr.
charles
white
hess
there
are
two
or
three
exhibits.
the
stipulation
refers
to
the
exhibits.
one
is
the
national
stock
summary
which
summarizes
the
activity
in
over-the-counter
stocks
and
it’s
used
by
the
internal
revenue
service
for

evaluation,
that
type
of
thing.
and,
we
have
all
of
the
bid
and
ask
--
and
exchanges
is
made
during
two
or
three
months
around
july
of
1957.
the
other
exhibit
is
a
letter
from
francis
i.
dupont
which
was
the
chief
market
maker
in
the
stock
at
that
time
quoting
the
bid
and
ask
prices
on
10
days
either
side
of
the
date
of
the
exchange.
and
the
stipulation
refers
to
this
and
states
that
the
value
was
$33.
in
addition
to
the
preferred
being
worth
$33
in
the
market,
there
were
four
years
of
dividend
arrearages
on
the
preferred.
national’s
credit
rating
was
so
poor
at
that
time
that
it
could
not
borrow
sufficient
funds
from
banks
to
finance
inventory
requirements
for
its
operations.
national’s
balance
sheet
and
operating
statement,
which
are
reflected
in
the
tax
returns
which
are
exhibits
in
our
record,
reflected
that
its
prefer
--
reflected
that
its
overall
financial
picture
was
very
poor.
it
did
not
have
sufficient
cash
or
liquid
assets
to
redeem
the
preferred
for
$33
in
cash.
the
fact
that
the
preferred
shareholders
were
to
be
removed
by
this
redemption
as
equity
owners
in
national
through
the
redemption
meant
that
the
negotiations
preceding
the
exchange
and
the
exchange
itself
were
arm’s
length
dealings,
taking
into
account
the
relative
positions
of
each
of
the
preferred
shareholders
at
the
time
of
the
exchange.
the
ruling
letter
issued
by
the
treasury
prior
to
the
exchange
properly
describing
the
exchange
as
a
redemption
and
requiring
the
recognition
by
the
preferred
shareholders
of
gain
or
loss
on
the
exchange
clearly
acknowledged
the
arm’s
length
dealing
inherent
in
such
an
exchange
which
took
into
account
the
economic
status
of
the
parties
at
that
time.
judge
phillips
for
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
the
economic
realities
existing
in
the
transaction
which
lead
him
to
the
proper
conclusion
that
the
debentures
were
issued
for
$33
and
that
the
$17
difference
was
interest
in
the
form
of
discount.
he
recognized
that
the
financial
status
and
negotiating
position
of
the
parties
in
1957
and
the
then
current
value
of
the
preferred
stock
determined
the
face
amount,
the
stated
interest
rate,
and
the
discount
on
the
debentures.
all
of
which
are
variable
factors
depending
upon
the
circumstances
of
any
given
exchange.
mr.
charles
white
hess
that
is
true.
mr.
charles
white
hess
very
much
so.
i
think
his
analogy,
although
it
sets
up
slightly
different
facts,
really
explains
the
economic
realities
of
what
happened.
if
national
had
done
that,
i’m
not
sure
exactly
what
would’ve
happened.
they
may
not
have
been
able
to
sell
their
debentures
for
$33
cash.
the
discount
may
have
been
greater.
there’s
no
guarantee
that,
in
the
marketplace,
that
they
could’ve
gotten
$33.
they
might
have
gotten
$25
and
we’d
have
been
asking
for
deductions
for
$25
instead
of
$17.
mr.
charles
white
hess
yes.
mr.
charles
white
hess
the
--
in
all
of
the
cases
that
had
been
cited
on
the
variant
issues
here,
the
court
of
claims
and
the
tax
court
are
the
only
ones
that
had
gone
this
direction.
the
courts
of
appeals
have
gone
the
other
way,
the
various
circuit
courts
of
appeal.
and,
i
think
that
they’ve
just
gotten
--
they
got
off
on
wrong
intention
and
i
can’t
explain
that,
their
decision,
i
think
it’s
wrong.
they
purposely
refused
to
follow
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
(inaudible)
and
santa
fe
case
which
was
a
decision
that
was
made
in
1970
which
allowed
bond
discount
in
a
railroad
reorganization
situation.
mr.
charles
white
hess
right,
i
sure
do.
mr.
charles
white
hess
i’m
not
sure
that
i
have
the
background
to
tell
you
that.
i
do
know
that
from
the
calculations
that
judge
phillips
made,
the
actual
dollar
effect
of
this
was
that
an
additional
1.9%
interest
would
be
added
to
the
stated
interest
rate
of
5%.
so
although
the
discount
in
terms
of
$17
on
$50
sounds
high,
if
you
recognize
it
in
the
form
of
6.9%
total
interest,
that’s
not
all
that
high.
mr.
charles
white
hess
yes,
i
can’t
calculate
quite
that
fast,
but
i
assume
it
would
be
much
smaller
than
1.9%.
it
might
be
0.5,
it
might
bring
it
up
to
5.5.
mr.
charles
white
hess
the
discount
will
vary
directly
with
the
stated
interest
rate,
it’s
one
factor
and
--
mr.
charles
white
hess
condition,
right.
mr.
charles
white
hess
and
national,
at
this
time,
was
not
strong.
judge
phillips
noted
that
the
preferred
shareholders
were
acting
as
a
financing
medium
to
the
extent
of
the
$33
of
actual
value
of
the
debentures
received
by
them,
an
amount
which
national
did
not
have
in
cash
to
pay
them.
now
underlying
these
economic
facts,
the
court
of
appeals
understood
that
the
preferred
shareholders
upon
receiving
the
debentures
became
creditors
and
that
national’s
relationship
to
them
after
the
exchange
was
entirely
different
than
before.
first
of
all,
there
was
the
requirement
for
repayment
of
$50
at
the
maturity
in
18
years.
secondly,
there
was
a
fixed
interest
payments
that
had
to
be
made.
the
default
provisions
of
the
indenture
exposed
national’s
assets
in
the
event
that
the
interest
or
principal
were
not
paid.
restrictions
in
the
indenture
prohibited
numerous
financing
in
operational
activities
of
national,
and
the
establishment
of
and
payments
to
a
sinking
fund
further
protected
the
debenture
holders.
in
fact,
the
sinking
fund
was
used
entirely
properly.
it
was
funded
at
every
point
that
it
was
supposed
to
be
funded
and
the
debentures
have
been
retired
in
proper
order.
now,
in
contrast
to
the
economic
analysis
approach
in
our
case
which
the
court
of
appeals
took,
the
erie
lackawanna
case
which
is
a
court
of
claims
case
takes
an
historical
approach
and
it
was
mentioned
by
mr.
smith.
now,
erie
lackawanna,
being
a
court
of
claims
decision,
is
the
corner
stone
of
all
of
the
cases
supporting
the
commissioner’s
position,
in
this
case
and
from
which
he
has
attempted
to
develop
some
theory
which
would
prevent
the
use
of
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred
as
the
issue
price
of
the
debentures.
the
dissent
in
our
case
relied
on
the
rationale
of
the
erie
case.
but
the
approach
used
in
erie
has
been
termed
the
arithmetical
equivalence
theory
or
the
numerical
equivalence
theory
which
mr.
smith
used
today.
basically,
it
is
--
that
approach
is
that
since
$50
was
originally
received
upon
issuance
of
the
preferred
by
national
and,
ultimately,
many
years
later,
national
will
pay
$50
to
a
debenture
holder,
then
the
corporation
has
not
been
hurt.
the
total
inadequacy
of
this
arithmetical
equivalence
approach
is
three-fold.
first,
it
ignores
the
basic
qualitative
differences
between
debt
and
equity
instruments.
namely,
the
$50
face
amount
on
the
debentures
must
be
paid
back.
the
$50
par
on
the
preferred
is
never
required
to
be
paid
back.
the
debentures
appear
as
a
long-term
liability
on
the
balance
sheet.
the
preferred
--
the
interest
of
the
preferred
holders
appears
in
a
stockholder’s
equity
account
and
these
entries
reflect
the
basic
transformation
that
occurs
in
an
exchange.
the
debenture
holder
is
a
creditor
and
not
an
owner.
he
has
no
residual
interest
in
the
corporation
or
its
profitability.
he
has
no
voice
in
corporate
policy
and,
he
takes
no
risk.
none
of
these
are
true
with
the
preferred.
the
arithmetical
equivalence
theory
also
ignores
the
economic
reality
surrounding
exchange.
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
economic
facts
at
the
date
of
the
exchange
determine
the
elements
of
consideration
given
by
each
of
the
parties
to
the
exchange,
the
amicus
norton
simon
set
forth
a
hypothetical
which
i
think
is
very
appropriate
in
showing
the
impropriety
of
this
arithmetical
equivalence
theory.
if
national’s
preferred
had
been
$10
par,
but
the
fair
market
value
at
the
date
of
the
exchange
was
$50
and
national
went
ahead
and
issued
a
$50
face
amount
debenture
for
the
preferred,
under
the
erie
lackawanna
case
and
the
arithmetical
equivalence
theory,
we
would
be
entitled
to
a
deduction
or
discount
of
$40,
the
difference
between
the
$50
face
amount
of
the
bond
and
the
$10
par
value
of
the
preferred.
obviously,
this
is
not
right.
we
would
be
giving
up
a
face
amount
debenture
worth
$50
and
receiving
something
of
--
with
a
fair
market
value
of
50,
and
i
think
these
points
out
the
weakness
of
that
arithmetical
equivalence
theory.
now,
the
arithmetical
equivalence
theory
finds
no
support
in
the
internal
revenue
code
sections
dealing
with
bond
discounts.
in
analyzing
the
appropriateness
of
national’s
deduction
for
interest
in
the
form
of
discount,
you
must
realize
that
the
internal
revenue
code
contains
counterparts
of
the
interest
deduction
for
amortized
bond
discount.
these
provisions
provide
the
symmetry
to
the
text
elements
of
a
transaction
normally
found
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
debenture
holder
reports
the
interest
which
is
in
the
form
of
discounts
as
ordinary
incomes.
if
a
corporation
repurchases
its
debentures
in
the
market
at
less
than
face
value,
which
national
did
in
this
case,
the
difference
between
the
face
value
and
the
lesser
price
paid
in
the
market
is
reported
as
ordinary
income
by
the
corporation
on
its
tax
returns.
if,
for
policy
reasons,
the
commissioner
or
others
such
as
the
court
in
erie
feel
that
a
corporation
should
not
obtain
a
deduction
for
discount
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
it
is
clearly
authorized
by
the
codes
and
sections
dealing
with
interest
deductions
and
where
it
is
clearly
supported
by
the
economic
facts
in
the
situation,
then
we
believe
that
the
place
for
them
to
look
is
to
congress.
however,
it
may
be
too
late
at
this
point
because
congress
in
the
1969
tax
reform
act
resolved
this
problem
for
the
future
and,
we
believe,
did
so
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
this
case
was
appropriate.

letter
issued
by
the
treasury
prior
to
the
exchange
properly
describing
the
exchange
as
a
redemption
and
requiring
the
recognition
by
the
preferred
shareholders
of
gain
or
loss
on
the
exchange
clearly
acknowledged
the
arm’s
length
dealing
inherent
in
such
an
exchange
which
took
into
account
the
economic
status
of
the
parties
at
that
time.
judge
phillips
for
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
the
economic
realities
existing
in
the
transaction
which
lead
him
to
the
proper
conclusion
that
the
debentures
were
issued
for
$33
and
that
the
$17
difference
was
interest
in
the
form
of
discount.
he
recognized
that
the
financial
status
and
negotiating
position
of
the
parties
in
1957
and
the
then
current
value
of
the
preferred
stock
determined
the
face
amount,
the
stated
interest
rate,
and
the
discount
on
the
debentures.
all
of
which
are
variable
factors
depending
upon
the
circumstances
of
any
given
exchange.
mr.
charles
white
hess
that
is
true.
mr.
charles
white
hess
very
much
so.
i
think
his
analogy,
although
it
sets
up
slightly
different
facts,
really
explains
the
economic
realities
of
what
happened.
if
national
had
done
that,
i’m
not
sure
exactly
what
would’ve
happened.
they
may
not
have
been
able
to
sell
their
debentures
for
$33
cash.
the
discount
may
have
been
greater.
there’s
no
guarantee
that,
in
the
marketplace,
that
they
could’ve
gotten
$33.
they
might
have
gotten
$25
and
we’d
have
been
asking
for
deductions
for
$25
instead
of
$17.
mr.
charles
white
hess
yes.
mr.
charles
white
hess
the
--
in
all
of
the
cases
that
had
been
cited
on
the
variant
issues
here,
the
court
of
claims
and
the
tax
court
are
the
only
ones
that
had
gone
this
direction.
the
courts
of
appeals
have
gone
the
other
way,
the
various
circuit
courts
of
appeal.
and,
i
think
that
they’ve
just
gotten
--
they
got
off
on
wrong
intention
and
i
can’t
explain
that,
their
decision,
i
think
it’s
wrong.
they
purposely
refused
to
follow
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
tenth
circuit
in
(inaudible)
and
santa
fe
case
which
was
a
decision
that
was
made
in
1970
which
allowed
bond
discount
in
a
railroad
reorganization
situation.
mr.
charles
white
hess
right,
i
sure
do.
mr.
charles
white
hess
i’m
not
sure
that
i
have
the
background
to
tell
you
that.
i
do
know
that
from
the
calculations
that
judge
phillips
made,
the
actual
dollar
effect
of
this
was
that
an
additional
1.9%
interest
would
be
added
to
the
stated
interest
rate
of
5%.
so
although
the
discount
in
terms
of
$17
on
$50
sounds
high,
if
you
recognize
it
in
the
form
of
6.9%
total
interest,
that’s
not
all
that
high.
mr.
charles
white
hess
yes,
i
can’t
calculate
quite
that
fast,
but
i
assume
it
would
be
much
smaller
than
1.9%.
it
might
be
0.5,
it
might
bring
it
up
to
5.5.
mr.
charles
white
hess
the
discount
will
vary
directly
with
the
stated
interest
rate,
it’s
one
factor
and
--
mr.
charles
white
hess
condition,
right.
mr.
charles
white
hess
and
national,
at
this
time,
was
not
strong.
judge
phillips
noted
that
the
preferred
shareholders
were
acting
as
a
financing
medium
to
the
extent
of
the
$33
of
actual
value
of
the
debentures
received
by
them,
an
amount
which
national
did
not
have
in
cash
to
pay
them.
now
underlying
these
economic
facts,
the
court
of
appeals
understood
that
the
preferred
shareholders
upon
receiving
the
debentures
became
creditors
and
that
national’s
relationship
to
them
after
the
exchange
was
entirely
different
than
before.
first
of
all,
there
was
the
requirement
for
repayment
of
$50
at
the
maturity
in
18
years.
secondly,
there
was
a
fixed
interest
payments
that
had
to
be
made.
the
default
provisions
of
the
indenture
exposed
national’s
assets
in
the
event
that
the
interest
or
principal
were
not
paid.
restrictions
in
the
indenture
prohibited
numerous
financing
in
operational
activities
of
national,
and
the
establishment
of
and
payments
to
a
sinking
fund
further
protected
the
debenture
holders.
in
fact,
the
sinking
fund
was
used
entirely
properly.
it
was
funded
at
every
point
that
it
was
supposed
to
be
funded
and
the
debentures
have
been
retired
in
proper
order.
now,
in
contrast
to
the
economic
analysis
approach
in
our
case
which
the
court
of
appeals
took,
the
erie
lackawanna
case
which
is
a
court
of
claims
case
takes
an
historical
approach
and
it
was
mentioned
by
mr.
smith.
now,
erie
lackawanna,
being
a
court
of
claims
decision,
is
the
corner
stone
of
all
of
the
cases
supporting
the
commissioner’s
position,
in
this
case
and
from
which
he
has
attempted
to
develop
some
theory
which
would
prevent
the
use
of
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred
as
the
issue
price
of
the
debentures.
the
dissent
in
our
case
relied
on
the
rationale
of
the
erie
case.
but
the
approach
used
in
erie
has
been
termed
the
arithmetical
equivalence
theory
or
the
numerical
equivalence
theory
which
mr.
smith
used
today.
basically,
it
is
--
that
approach
is
that
since
$50
was
originally
received
upon
issuance
of
the
preferred
by
national
and,
ultimately,
many
years
later,
national
will
pay
$50
to
a
debenture
holder,
then
the
corporation
has
not
been
hurt.
the
total
inadequacy
of
this
arithmetical
equivalence
approach
is
three-fold.
first,
it
ignores
the
basic
qualitative
differences
between
debt
and
equity
instruments.
namely,
the
$50
face
amount
on
the
debentures
must
be
paid
back.
the
$50
par
on
the
preferred
is
never
required
to
be
paid
back.
the
debentures
appear
as
a
long-term
liability
on
the
balance
sheet.
the
preferred
--
the
interest
of
the
preferred
holders
appears
in
a
stockholder’s
equity
account
and
these
entries
reflect
the
basic
transformation
that
occurs
in
an
exchange.
the
debenture
holder
is
a
creditor
and
not
an
owner.
he
has
no
residual
interest
in
the
corporation
or
its
profitability.
he
has
no
voice
in
corporate
policy
and,
he
takes
no
risk.
none
of
these
are
true
with
the
preferred.
the
arithmetical
equivalence
theory
also
ignores
the
economic
reality
surrounding
exchange.
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
economic
facts
at
the
date
of
the
exchange
determine
the
elements
of
consideration
given
by
each
of
the
parties
to
the
exchange,
the
amicus
norton
simon
set
forth
a
hypothetical
which
i
think
is
very
appropriate
in
showing
the
impropriety
of
this
arithmetical
equivalence
theory.
if
national’s
preferred
had
been
$10
par,
but
the
fair
market
value
at
the
date
of
the
exchange
was
$50
and
national
went
ahead
and
issued
a
$50
face
amount
debenture
for
the
preferred,
under
the
erie
lackawanna
case
and
the
arithmetical
equivalence
theory,
we
would
be
entitled
to
a
deduction
or
discount
of
$40,
the
difference
between
the
$50
face
amount
of
the
bond
and
the
$10
par
value
of
the
preferred.
obviously,
this
is
not
right.
we
would
be
giving
up
a
face
amount
debenture
worth
$50
and
receiving
something
of
--
with
a
fair
market
value
of
50,
and
i
think
these
points
out
the
weakness
of
that
arithmetical
equivalence
theory.
now,
the
arithmetical
equivalence
theory
finds
no
support
in
the
internal
revenue
code
sections
dealing
with
bond
discounts.
in
analyzing
the
appropriateness
of
national’s
deduction
for
interest
in
the
form
of
discount,
you
must
realize
that
the
internal
revenue
code
contains
counterparts
of
the
interest
deduction
for
amortized
bond
discount.
these
provisions
provide
the
symmetry
to
the
text
elements
of
a
transaction
normally
found
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
debenture
holder
reports
the
interest
which
is
in
the
form
of
discounts
as
ordinary
incomes.
if
a
corporation
repurchases
its
debentures
in
the
market
at
less
than
face
value,
which
national
did
in
this
case,
the
difference
between
the
face
value
and
the
lesser
price
paid
in
the
market
is
reported
as
ordinary
income
by
the
corporation
on
its
tax
returns.
if,
for
policy
reasons,
the
commissioner
or
others
such
as
the
court
in
erie
feel
that
a
corporation
should
not
obtain
a
deduction
for
discount
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
it
is
clearly
authorized
by
the
codes
and
sections
dealing
with
interest
deductions
and
where
it
is
clearly
supported
by
the
economic
facts
in
the
situation,
then
we
believe
that
the
place
for
them
to
look
is
to
congress.
however,
it
may
be
too
late
at
this
point
because
congress
in
the
1969
tax
reform
act
resolved
this
problem
for
the
future
and,
we
believe,
did
so
in
a
manner
consistent
with
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
this
case
was
appropriate.
respondent
respectfully
requests
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
be
affirmed.
thank
you
very
much.
