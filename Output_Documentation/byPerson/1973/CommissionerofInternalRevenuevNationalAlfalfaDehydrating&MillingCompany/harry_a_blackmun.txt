did
they
stipulate
to
the

that
it
would’ve
been

purchase

on

mr.
hess,
i
suppose
if
national
alfalfa
had
actually
done
that,
gone
out
into
the
market
and
done
what
was
supposed,
you
wouldn’t
be
here,
there’d
be
no
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course
in
tax
law
we
have
a
lot
of
distinctions
and
cases
depending
on
what
actually
was
done,
not
on
what
might
have
been
done,
but
you
feel
that
what
might
have
been
done
equates
with
what
was
done?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
your
tax
court
decision
was
reviewed
by
the
full
court,
wasn’t
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it’s
a
little
surprising
you
didn’t
pick
up
somebody
in
your
favor
among
that
array
of
tax
judges.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course
the
tax
court’s
been
wrong
before.
you
hope
they’re
wrong
again.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
is
a
tax
case
coming
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
we
granted
certiorari
on
the
petition
of
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
because
of
an
indicated
conflict
with
decisions
of
the
court
of
claims.
the
corporate
taxpayer
in
1957
issued
sinking
fund
debentures
in
exchange
for
its
then
outstanding
cumulative
preferred
shares.
the
issue
is
whether
the
taxpayer
is
entitled
to
claim
an
interest
paid
deduction
from
gross
income
on
account
of
amortizable
debt
discount.
the
taxpayer
would
measure
that
discount
by
the
difference
between
the
face
amount
of
the
debentures
and
its
claimed
value
of
the
preferred
shares
at
the
time
of
the
exchange.
the
commissioner
disallowed
the
deduction
and
was
upheld
in
this
decision
by
the
tax
court.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
by
divided
vote
reversed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
the
taxpayer
did
not
incur
amortizable
debt
discount
upon
the
exchange
of
its
debentures
for
its
outstanding
preferred.
the
reasons
are
set
forth
in
the
opinion
at
some
length
and
accordingly
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
stewart
concurs
in
the
judgment
in
parts
one,
two
and
three
of
the
opinion
that
has
been
filed.
