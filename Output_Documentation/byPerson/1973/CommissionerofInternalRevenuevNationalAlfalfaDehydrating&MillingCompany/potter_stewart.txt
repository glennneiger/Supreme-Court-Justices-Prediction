what

but
there
was

on

there?

they

at

there’s
no

there’s

what
happened
here
was
that
each
shareholder
turned
in
a
piece
of
property
worth
$33
in
return
for
a
$50
bond.
is
that
right?
justice

in

justice

in

justice

it
was
worth
$61
because

had
no

to
compel

justice

if
had
there
been
redemption?
justice

but
there
wasn’t,
there
was
an
exchange
--
justice

--
of
a
piece
of
property
worth
$33,
i.e.
the
preferred
stock
of
the
company,
in
return
for
a

bond
bearing
a
5%
rate
of

in
18-year
bond,
is
that
it?
justice

you
don’t
need
to
cut
this
thing
and
dichotomize
it?
justice
potter
stewart
you
think
it
is
error.
justice
potter
stewart
let’s
assume
it
was
error.
just
look
at
it
as
a
unitary
transaction
in
exchange
of
property
worth
$33
for
a
bond
with
a
$50
face
value
and
a
5%
interest
rate
with
an
18-year
maturity.
justice

how
would
the
value
to
the
corporation
be
measured?
would
it
be
the
$61
figure?
justice
potter
stewart
if
they
would’ve
cost
the
corporation
$61
in
cash
to
redeem
any
one
of
these
preferred
shares
as
of
the
time
of
the
conversion,
would
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
so
i
would
suppose
that
would
be
the
“value”
to
the
corporation,
that’s
what
it
would’ve
cost
the
corporation
to
get
it.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
although
the
corporation
could
go
out
in
the
open
market
and
buy
it
for
$33.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
justice

stewart
but
you
don’t
understand,
in
other
words,
what
the
court
meant
by
the
alternative.
justice
potter
stewart
either
the
--
it’s
either
the
par
value,
assuming
that
par
value
had
been
the
true
amount
paid
in
capital,
or
you
say
alternatively
the
value
to
the
corporation
and
your
representation
is
you
don’t
understand
what
that
means
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
voting
rights,
if
any,
did
the
holders
of
the
preferred
shares
have?
justice
potter
stewart
share-for-share
with
the
common
shareholders?
justice

stewart
many
if
you’re
par
view
of
shares.
justice
potter
stewart
and
no
increase
in
voting
power
when
there
were
arrearages?
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
get
a
very
substantial
discount
sometimes
depending
upon
the
stated
interest
rate
in
the
debenture.
i
mean,
if
it
were
2%,
say
the
debenture
compared
to
today’s
interest
rates,
there
would
be
a
tremendous
discount
and,
plus
the
condition
of
the
issuer.
i
mean,
a
debenture,
by
definition,
is
an
unsecured

basically,
unsecured
debt
obligation
as
contrasted
to
a

and,
that
could
