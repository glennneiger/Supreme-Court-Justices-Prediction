mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
income
tax
case
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
it
involves
the
questions
whether
amortizable
bond
discount,
which
is
deductible
as
interest
under
section
163
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
arose
out
of
a
transaction
accomplished
by
the
respondent
corporation
in
1957.
specifically,
the
transaction
involved
was
an
elimination
of
respondent’s
outstanding
$50,
par
5%
cumulative
preferred
stock,
and
a
substitution
for
this
eliminated
preferred
stock
of
an
issue
of
$50
face
amount,
5%
bonds
to
be
issued
to
the
holders
of
the
eliminated
preferred
on
a
dollar-for-dollar
basis.
the
detailed
facts
underlying
this
transaction
are
briefly
as
follows.
in
1957,
respondent
had
two
stock
issues
outstanding.
first,
an
issue
of
$1
par
common
stock;
secondly,
an
issue
of
47,059
shares
of
$50
par
5%
cumulative
preferred
on
which
there
were,
in
1957,
dividend
arrearages
amounting
to
$10
per
share.
according
to
the
certificate
of
incorporation,
the
preferred
stock
was
redeemable
according
to
a
fixed
downward
sliding
scale.
so
that,
in
1957,
the
redemption
price
was
$51
per
share
plus
the
$10
dividend
arrearages.
the
preferred
shares
redeemed
could
not
be
reissued,
but
pursuant
to
provisions
of
the
articles
of
incorporation,
had
to
be
canceled
upon
receipt
or
ultimately
returned
to
the
redeeming
shareholders.
on
april
8,
1957,
respondent’s
directors
proposed
a
three-part
plan
which
they
characterized
as
a
reorganization
of
the
company
by
way
of
a
recapitalization.
the
three
steps
to
the
plan
were
as
follows.
first,
the
directors
proposed
a
series
of
three
amendments
to
the
certificate
of
incorporation.
under
the
first
amendment,
the
preferred
issue
would
be
eliminated.
secondly,
the
par
value
of
the
common
would
be
increased
from
$1
to
$3,
and
an
authorization
of
the
number
of
common
shares
would
be
increased
from
some
763,000
to
1
million
shares.
finally,
the
corporation
was
to
be
authorized
to
issue
warrants
for
the
purchase
of
common
stock.
the
second
part
of
the
plan
involve
the
issuance
of
18-year
bonds
bearing
a
stated
interest
rate
at
5%
and
a
$50
face
amount
to
the
holders
of
the
eliminated
preferred.
these
bonds
were
to
be
subordinate
to
bank
loans
for
inventory
and
to
supply
our
obligations.
the
bonds
were
to
be
redeemable
at
par
plus
accrued
interest
and,
like
the
preferred
stock
for
which
they
were
to
serve
a
substitute,
they
were
subject
to
a
sinking
fund
redemption
provision.
finally,
the
third
step
of
the
plan
was
to
issue
to
the
preferred
shareholders
a
warrant
enabling
them
to
purchase
common
stock.
the
terms
of
the
warrant
were
enable
the
prefer--
the
holders
of
the
eliminated
preferred
to
purchase
one-half
of
a
share
of
common
stock
at
$10
a
share.
this
warrant
was
to
be
in
lieu
of
the
dividend
the
arrearages
of
$10
which
existed
in
1957.
the
shareholders
approved
the
plan
and
the
focus
of
this
case
is
on
the
second
step
of
the
plan.
that
is,
the
issuance
of
bonds
in
substitution
for
the
eliminated
preferred
stock.
a
total
of
some
$2
million
of
face
amount
bonds
were
issued
which
was
exactly
equal
to
the
par
amount
of
the
eliminated
preferred.
thus,
the
capital
of
the
corporation
was
reduced
by
some
$2
million
in
the
preferred
stock
account,
and
the
bonds
payable
account
was
correspondingly
increased
by
the
same
amount.
at
the
time
of
this
transaction
in
1957,
there
had
been
sporadic
transactions
involving,
but
a
few
hundred
shares
on
an
over-the-counter
market
of
respondent’s
preferred
stock.
the
price
range
of
these
transactions
were
bid
ranging
from
$29
to
$33
a
share
and
an
offering
price
of
$32
to
$35
a
share.
respondent
claimed
discount
deductions
for
the
$17
difference
between
the
face
amount
of
each
bond
issued,
that
is,
$50
and
the
asserted
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred
stock
which
was
eliminated,
that
is,
$33.
this
case
involves
the
propriety
of
that
deduction.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
there’s
no
argument
that--
well--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
accuracy
of
that
figure
is
only
questionable
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
sporadic
nature
of
the
transactions
and
since
it
only
involved
but
a
few
hundred
shares
of
the
47,000
shares
outstanding,
but
for
purposes
of
this
case,
there’s
no
argument
that
the
fair
market
value
could
have
been
$33.
the
tax
court
upheld
the
commissioner’s
disallowance
of
the
deduction
in
a
unanimously
reviewed
decision,
but
the
tenth
circuit
reversed
with
one
judge
dissenting.
in
a
series
of
decisions
of
this
court,
this
amortizable
bond
discount
has
been
correctly
recognized
as
essentially
in
the
nature
of
interest.
and,
this
court
has
also
defined
in
numerous
decisions
“interest”
as
the
compensation
for
the
use
of
forbearance
of
money
which
has
long
been
deductible
under
the
income
tax
acts
and
which
is
currently
deductible
under
section
163
of
the
code.
the
best
way
to
understand
how
bond
discount
works,
we
believe,
is
by
reference
to
the
prototype
transaction
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
10.
in
this
prototype
transaction,
a
corporation
issues
a
bond
with
a
face
amount
of
$1,000
bearing
stated
interest
at
a
rate
of
5%
over
a
10-year
term.
the
bond
is
issued
for
$950.
the
stated
interest
of
5%
produces
an
interest
obligation
of
5%
of
$1,000
or
$50
a
year.
but
because
the
issuer
of
the
bond
must
pay
back
to
the
holder
an
additional
$50
after
the
bond
is
retired,
that
additional
$50
is
also
a
cost
of
borrowing
money
and,
as
such,
is
deductible
as
interest.
because
it
is
payable
over
the
term
of
the
bond,
this
court
and
appropriate
treasury
regulations
have
permitted
a
ratable
deduction
over
the
term
of
the
bond
or
amortization,
if
you
will.
thus,
the
allowable
deduction
to
the
issuer
on
the
prototype
bond
would
be
$55
a
year
and
not
$50
a
year.
the
critical
question
in
this
case
is
whether
this
transaction
is
analogous
to
the
prototype
transaction.
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
corporation
issued
a
$50
debenture
in
substitution
for
a
share
of
eliminated
$50
par
preferred
stock.
there’s
no
question
that
respondent,
upon
the
original
issuance
of
the
preferred
stock,
received
$50
in
the
corporate
teal,
so
to
speak.
it
has
now
transformed
that
preferred
stock
investment
into
a
liability
which
will
be
payable
over
an
18--
at
the
end
of
18
years.
it
originally
received
this
$50
and
it
now
promises
to
pay
$50
out
over
the
end
of
the
term.
this
equivalence
has
been
reflected
in
the
journal
entries
of
respondent
which
--
for
they
have
reduced
their
capital
account
by
the
$50
par
amount
for
each
bond
--
for
each
preferred
stock
share
which
has
been
eliminated
and
have
increased
their
bonds
payable
account
by
a
like
amount.
this
simple
substitution
of
one
security
for
another
does
not
involve
an
obligation
to
pay
in
the
future
any
more
than
the
$50
originally
received
for
the
preferred
stock.
and,
we
believe
that
as
a
matter
of
numerical
equivalence
there
can
be
no
discount
in
such
a
transaction.
now,
respondent
and
the
tenth
circuit
have
focused
on
these
sporadic
sales
of
the
preferred
shares
at
$33
a
share.
it
held
that
there
was
$17
of
discount
on
the
issuance
of
each
debenture.
but,
recalling
that
discount
simply
involves
an
obligation
to
pay
in
excess
of
an
amount
borrowed
just
as
the
corporation
in
the
prototype
transaction
has
promised
to
pay
$1,000
although
it
has
only
borrowed
$950,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
such
excess
in
this
case.
for
discount
to
exist
in
this
case,
the
amount
borrowed
must
be
somehow
analogous
to
the
$33
in
the
same
way
that
the
$950
in
cash
is
analogous
to
the
amount
borrowed
in
the
prototype
transaction.
but
unlike
the
prototype
transaction
where
the
corporation
has
fully
available
$950
of
cash
for
its
use
in
the
business,
here,
all
respondent
has
is
a
certificate
of
its
preferred
stock
which
is
immediately
canceled
by
the
terms
of
the
articles
of
incorporation.
thus,
the
so-called
$33
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred
stock
is
meaningless
to
the
respondent
and
in
no
sense,
can
it
be
said
to
have
received
$33
in
a
borrowing
transaction.
now,
respondent
disputes
this
analysis.
it
argues
that
it
only
entered
into
this
transaction
because
it
did
not
have
$33
in
cash
to
redeem
its
preferred
shares.
as
a
result,
it
had
to
issue
bonds
in
the
face
amount
of
$50
and
the
argument
goes
that
the
$17
of
excess
is
interest
or
deductible
discount.
it
analogizes
its
preferred
shareholders
through
a
so
called
financing
medium,
as
it
uses
the
term
in
its
brief.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
life
of
the
bond
here
was
18
years.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but
respondent’s
argument
assumes
that
it
could
have
redeemed
$33
for
cash,
but
recalling
that
the
preferred
shareholders
were
entitled
to
a
redemption
price
of
$51
a
share
in
1957
plus
the
$10
of
dividend
arrearages,
this
is
a
$61
obligation
per
share
to
each
preferred
shareholder
and
not
a
$33
obligation.
there
is
no
basis
for
inferring
that
the
excess
over
the
asserted
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred
stock
is
a
cost
for
the
use
of
borrowing
money.
indeed,
the
inference
that
discount
exists
in
this
case
becomes
even
weaker
when
we
recall
that
the
bonds
themselves
bore
a
stated
interest
rate
of
5%.
indeed,
if
respondent
had
redeemed
the
shares
for
cash
at
any
price,
the
cases
are
clear
that
it
would
be
entitled
to
no
income
tax
deduction
at
all.
it
therefore
becomes
apparent
that
it
is
simply
absurd
to
infer
a
$17
deduction
for
deductible
interest
when
the
redemption
price
was
possibly
as
much
as
$61.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
kind
of
analogy
was
one
of
the
basis
of
the
reasoning
of
the
court
below
and,
we
feel
that
it
is
simply
a
variation,
as
i
will
point
out,
of
respondent’s
financing
medium
argument.
the
tenth
--
what
the
tenth
circuit
did
was
to
analogize
the
transaction
and
to
break
it
down
into
two
elements:
one,
the
issuance
of
a
bond
--
$50
face
amount
bond
for
$33
in
cash
and
then
the
use
of
the
$33
in
cash
to
redeem
the
preferred
shares.
the
court
claimed
that,
looking
at
the
transaction
that
way,
that
there
would’ve
been
discount
as
a
result
of
the
first
aspect
of
the
transaction,
but
this
analogy,
we
feel,
is
erroneous
from
several
different
perspectives.
first
of
all,
it
is
the
transaction
at
issue
here,
the
unified
transaction
which
must
be
scrutinized
and
not
a
break
down
into
what
we
regard
as
hypothetical
nonexistent
components,
but
there
are
also
two
factual
misapprehensions
about
the
analogy.
to
begin
with,
it
is
entirely
unsupported
in
the
record
to
make
an
assumption
that
respondent
could
have
reissued
a
$50
--
if
it
had
issued
a
$50
bond
in
1957,
it
would
have
only
received
$33
in
cash,
especially
unsupported
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
bond
itself
carried
a
stated
interest
rate.
but,
as
i’ve
also
pointed
out,
there
is
no
basis
for
assuming
that
respondent
could
have
redeemed
its
preferred
shares
for
$33
in
cash
because
the
redemption
price
in
1957
was
$61.
and
if
this
$61
obligation
was
settled
for
$50
which
got
put
on
the
face
amount
of
the
bond,
there
is
no
reason
to
infer
that
any
part
of
that
$50
is
the
cost
of
borrowing.
now,
even
if
respondent
had
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
there’s
no
obligation
--
there
was
no
obligation.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
could
have.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
worth
$33,
but
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
in
the
market.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right,
but
not
worth
$33
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
he
had
no
right
to
compel
redemption,
but
if
redemption
were
to
be
affected
as
it
was
in
this
case,
it
had
to
be
--
it
could
have
--
the
shareholders
could
have
insisted
on
$61
per
share.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
had
there
been
redemption.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
in
exchange
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that’s
correct,
but
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
exactly
and
we
feel
that
the
tenth
circuit,
having
done
so,
that
it
was
error
to
have
done
that.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
because
this
was
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
okay.
well,
if
we
look
at
it
that
way,
the
--
first
of
all,
there
was
--
the
corporation
did
not
receive
property
worth
to
it
$33
in
the
same
way
that
the
corporation,
the
prototype
transaction,
received
an
amount
less
than
an
amount
which
it
obligated
itself
to
pay
in
the
future.
there
was
no
excess
--
obligation
to
pay
an
excess
over
an
amount
borrowed.
here,
the
numerical
equivalence
is
such
that
the
corporation
originally
took
in
$50
for
its
preferred
shares.
it
has
transformed
that
into
a
$50
liability
and
we
believe
that
the
$33
to
have
--
that
the
reference
to
the
$33
asserted
fair
market
value
of
preferred
shares
becomes
irrelevant
because
this
is
simply
a
substitution
of
one
security
for
another.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
a
bookkeeping
transaction
in
the
sense
that
it
is
a
reshuffling
of
one
security
for
another,
technically
called
a
recapitalization.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
are
different.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
are
different
kinds
of
securities,
but
we
don’t
think
that
makes
any
difference
in
this
case.
in
fact,
the
similarities,
mr.
chief
justice,
far
outweigh
the
differences
because
just
as
the
bonds
was
subordinate
to
supply
our
obligations
in
bank
loans,
the
preferred
shareholders
were
also
subordinate
--
could
only
get
their
$50
upon
a
voluntary
liquidation
of
the
corporation,
so
to
speak.
so
that,
both
really
stood
in
somewhat
the
same
position.
we
think
that
the
similarities
far
outweigh
the
differences.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
from
a
corporate
point
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
from
a
technical
corporate
point
of
view,
that’s
correct.
but,
we
don’t
think
that
should
make
any
difference
in
this
case
where
we
have
simply
$50
going
into
the
corporation
through
the
par
value
of
preferred
stock.
there’s
no
dispute
that
the
corporation
received
$50
and
then
it
simply
promises
to
pay
$50
in
the
future.
discount
involves
the
existence
of
an
obligation
to
pay
something
in
excess
of
an
amount
borrowed
and
there
was
no
obligation
here
to
pay
anything
in
excess
of
the
$50
the
corporation
originally
received
on
the
issuance
of
its
preferred
stock.
finally,
the
tenth
circuit’s
analogy
becomes
--
flies
squarely
in
the
face,
we
believe,
of
this
court’s
decision
in
great
western
power
company
versus
commissioner,
specifically
held
that
such
a
substitution
of
one
security
for
another
is
a
unified
transaction
and
not
a
transaction
involving
a
breakdown
of
the
issuance
of
the
second
one
for
the
cash
and
the
elimination
--
and
then
the
use
of
that
cash
to
eliminate
the
first
security.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
tenth
circuit
misconceived
the
basic
essentials
of
these
transactions.
so,
what
we
have
here
is
simply
the
substitution
of
one
security
for
another
and
we
submit
that
a
corporation’s
issuance
of
debentures
for
stock
is
simply
a
capital
readjustment
that
does
not
give
rise,
with
those
facts
alone,
to
an
inference
of
the
existence
--
for
the
existence
of
discount.
this
--
thus,
the
$33
asserted
market
value
of
preferred
shares
becomes
completely
irrelevant.
and
the
correctness
of
this
proposition,
we
believe,
is
amply
demonstrated
by
two
things
in
this
case
where
you
have
a
dollar-for-dollar
exchange
and
where,
as
a
matter
of
corporate
mechanics,
the
corporation
received
nothing
upon
the
exchange
because
the
stock
was
immediately
canceled.
now,
the
tax
court
decided
this
case
on
the
basis
of
a
dollar-for-dollar
exchange
and
in
so
holding,
it
followed
the
reasoning
of
a
series
of
recent
court
of
claims
decisions
which
had
also
premised
the
nonexistence
of
discount
in
transactions
like
these
on
a
dollar-for-dollar
equivalence
between
the
par
value
of
the
eliminated
preferred
stock
and
the
face
amount
of
the
bond.
now,
we
think
while
this
rationale
is
certainly
sufficient
to
reverse
the
judgment
below,
there
are
other
ramifications
of
this
problem
which
we
believe
this
court
should
consider
in
formulating
a
basis
for
its
decision.
as
i’ve
said,
as
a
general
proposition,
we
do
not
believe
that
a
capital
readjustment
of
this
type
gives
rise
to
amortizable
bond
discount.
consider
the
situation
of
the
corporation
having
issued
a
$55
face
amount
bond
for
the
$50
preferred
stock.
in
such
a
situation,
we
still
think
that
there
is
no
basis
for
inferring
bond
discount.
now,
the
court
of
claims
has
suggested
and
two
district
courts
have
more
explicitly
held
that
discount
might
arise
in
such
a
transaction.
a
district
court
decision
has
proposed
a
formula
for
the
measurement
of
discount
in
the
following
transaction
which
would
be
as
follows.
it
would
measure
the
difference
between
the
face
amount
of
the
bond
in
the
example
of
$55
and
the
greater
of
the
following
two
quantities.
first,
the
par
value
of
the
stock,
here
$50
or
the
value
of
the
preferred
stock
to
the
corporation
at
the
time
of
the
exchange.
now,
under
the
district
court’s
formula,
the
value
to
the
corporation
of
the
preferred
stock
may
be
greater
than
the
par
value
of
the
preferred
stock,
but
could
in
no
instance
be
less
than
the
par
value.
thus,
for
purposes
of
the
example,
under
the
district
court’s
approach
there
could
be
as
much
as
$5
of
discount
in
this
transaction
in
the
$55
--
50
transaction,
but
might
be
less.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it’s
not
entirely
clear,
mr.
justice
stewart,
exactly
what
the
district
court
had
in
mind
and
that
is
one
of
our
complaints
about
this
test.
we
think
that
the
concept
of
value
to
the
corporation
introduces
as
vague
and
meaningless
term.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
on
a
redemption.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
problem
with
that
kind
of
analysis
is
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
but
as
--
simply,
as
a
matter
of
realistic
market
mechanics,
i
would
assume
that
if
the
corporation
here
attempted
to
buy
up
as
many
shares
as
it
could
on
the
open
market
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
it’s
intention
to
retire
the
whole
issue
would’ve
become
apparent
and
the
market
price
would’ve
been
pushed
up
toward
the
redemption
price.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
it’s
not
entirely
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
don’t
think
the
courts
quite
understand
what
the
value
to
the
corporation
means
because
the
court
of
claims
has
suggested
that
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred
stock
is
a
relevant
consideration
for
determining
the
value
to
the
corporation,
but
it
is
not
a
determinant
consideration.
thus,
it
seems
that
the
courts
know
that
they
want
to
get
away
from
this
approach
once
they
get
away
from
fair
market
value
which,
of
course,
we
also
contend
is
erroneous,
but
it’s
not
clear
to
the
courts
exactly
what
this
term
“value
to
the
corporation”
is.
now,
whatever
it
is,
we
submit
that
there
still
is
no
basis
for
an
inference
that
discount
arises
in
such
a
transaction.
to
begin
with,
if
the
term
“value
to
the
corporation”
means
what
the
corporation
would
be
willing
to
pay
for
the
preferred
stock,
then
even
under
the
district
court’s
formula
there
would
be
no
discount
because
there
would
be
a
face
amount
of
$55
for
the
bond
and
the
corporation
would
be
willing
to
pay
$55
for
the
stock.
thus,
there
would
be
no
element
of
that
$50
--
$55
figure
would
constitute
a
cost
of
borrowing.
indeed,
there
are
many
instances
which
we
might
call
to
mind
to
suggest
why
a
corporation
would
be
willing
to
purchase
its
preferred
stock
for
more
than
its
par
value.
there
could
be
a
call
premium,
or
whatever,
which
might
force
the
corporation
to
be
required
to
pay
from
its
shareholder
more
than
the
par
value
of
the
stock.
so,
if
that
value
to
the
corporation
means
the
price
at
which
the
corporation
pays
for
the
stock,
there
would
be
no
discount.
but,
even
conversely,
if
the
face
amount
of
the
bond
represents
somewhat
more
than
the
corporation
would
be
willing
to
pay
for
the
stock,
there
is
still
no
reason
to
infer
the
existence
of
discount.
there
are
varieties
of
other
corporate
reasons
completely
unrelated
to
the
cost
of
borrowing
money
which
could
form
a
basis
for
understanding
why
a
corporation
would
enter
into
a
transaction
like
this.
for
example,
in
this
very
case,
respondent
could
have
--
respondent
wanted
to
eliminate
the
dividend
arrearages.
it
could’ve
decided
that
it
wanted
to
transform
nondeductible
dividends
on
preferred
stock
into
deductible
interests.
it
could’ve
decided
it
wanted
to
eliminate
the
preferred
shares
which
were
held
by
a
dissident
group.
in
any
event,
we
submit
that
there
are
varieties
of
other
independent
reasons
which
would
form
the
basis
of
a
decision
why
a
corporation
would
be
willing
to
pay
more
for
its
preferred
stock
than
the
so-called
market
value
or
its
value
to
the
corporation
which
are
totally
unrelated
to
the
cost
of
borrowing
money.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
did
vote
as
a
class
and,
in
fact,
voted
on
this
very
plan.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
as
--
i
think,
simply,
it
was
a
much
smaller
class.
i
think
it
was
share-for-share.
i’m
not
exactly
sure.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
par
view
of
shares.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
not
that
i’m
aware
of.
i
see
that
i
have
little
time
left.
i
would
like
to
save
it
for
rebuttal
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
just
a
few
points.
mr.
justice
blackmun
asked
about
the
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred
stock.
the
reference
in
this
stipulation
in
the
tax
court
is
at
page
27
of
the
record,
paragraph
13.
there
was
no
stipulation
between
the
parties
with
respect
to
fair
market
value.
all
the
stipulation
says,
is
attached
hereto
and
marked
as
exhibit
17,
is
a
letter
from
francis
i.
dupont
and
company
in
which
the
bid
and
ask
range
prices
are
quoted.
that’s
the
only
thing
in
the
record
with
respect
to
the
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred
stock.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
because
from
our
point
of
view
the
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred,
whatever
the
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred
stock,
doesn’t
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
doesn’t
make
any
difference.
since
discount
involves
an
obligation
to
pay
an
amount
in
excess
of
an
amount
borrowed,
we
don’t
think
that
there
was
anything
in
excess
of
$50.
with
respect
to
the
similarities
and
difference
--
alleged
differences,
between
the
preferred
stock
and
the
debentures,
let
me
just
refer
the
court
to
the
discussion
on
pages
14
and
15
of
our
brief
in
which
it
is
pointed
out
that
both
the
preferred
stock
and
the
debentures
were
both
subject
to
comparable
sinking
fund
provisions
which
would
retire
both
of
them.
i
think
that
simply,
as
a
matter
of
realism,
both
the
preferred
shareholders
here
and
the
debenture
holders
were
both
subject
to
the
risk
of
the
business.
if
the
business
didn’t
make
any
money,
then
the
debenture
holders
wouldn’t
get
paid
nor
would
the
preferred
shareholder’s
investment
really
be
worth
anything.
i
think
in
closing,
what
i
simply
want
to
emphasize
is
what
the
taxpayer
is
arguing
for
here
is
an
automatic
rule
which
would
insist
upon
the
existence
of
discount
between
the
face
amount
of
the
debenture
and
the
asserted
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred
stock.
we
say,
on
those
facts
alone,
there
is
no
basis
for
inferring
discount
and
that
the
basis
of
the
lack
of
discount
is
graphically
illustrated
in
this
case
by
the
equivalence
between
the
par
value
of
the
preferred
stock
and
the
base
amount
of
the
debenture.
the
corporation
took
in
$50
and
promised
to
pay
out
no
more
than
$50
over
the
end
of
the
term.
but
simply,
if
the
corporation
had
increased
the
face
amounts
of
the
debenture,
we
do
not
think
--
it’s
$55,
we
don’t
think
that
there
is
a
basis
for
inferring
the
existence
of
discount.
we
think
that
the
taxpayer
should
be
put
to
the
burden
of
demonstrating
that
that
excess
really
represents
the
cost
of
borrowing
and
that
since
that
there
are
a
variety
of
reasons
why
a
corporation
would
want
to
enter
into
a
transaction
like
this
--
i
see
my
time
is
up,
i’ll
just
finish
my
sentence,
we
think
that
those
reasons
should
control
unless
there
is
strong
evidence
inferring
an
additional
cost
of
bond.
thank
you.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
do
not
think
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
have
filed
the
reply
brief,
mr.
justice
powell,
which
discusses
this
point.
briefly,
we
do
not
attach
any
significant
--
any
really
significance
to
the
1969
amendment.
but,
we
do
note
that
the
approach
of
congress
in
1969
is
parallel
to
the
approach
we
would
take
in
this
case.
that,
as
a
general
rule,
when
a
corporation
issues
bonds
for
property,
congress
has
declared
in
1969
that
the
issue
price
is
equal
to
the
face
amount
of
the
bond
with
only
two
exceptions,
that
either
the
bonds
be
traded
on
a
public
exchange,
or
that
the
stock
be
traded
on
a
public
exchange.
neither
of
those
facts
exists
in
this
case,
and
we
think
that
the
general
rule
without
the
exceptions
lend
support
and
is
parallel
to
the
approach
we
take
here.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
income
tax
case
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
it
involves
the
questions
whether
amortizable
bond
discount,
which
is
deductible
as
interest
under
section
163
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
arose
out
of
a
transaction
accomplished
by
the
respondent
corporation
in
1957.
specifically,
the
transaction
involved
was
an
elimination
of
respondent’s
outstanding
$50,
par
5%
cumulative
preferred
stock,
and
a
substitution
for
this
eliminated
preferred
stock
of
an
issue
of
$50
face
amount,
5%
bonds
to
be
issued
to
the
holders
of
the
eliminated
preferred
on
a
dollar-for-dollar
basis.
the
detailed
facts
underlying
this
transaction
are
briefly
as
follows.
in
1957,
respondent
had
two
stock
issues
outstanding.
first,
an
issue
of
$1
par
common
stock;
secondly,
an
issue
of
47,059
shares
of
$50
par
5%
cumulative
preferred
on
which
there
were,
in
1957,
dividend
arrearages
amounting
to
$10
per
share.
according
to
the
certificate
of
incorporation,
the
preferred
stock
was
redeemable
according
to
a
fixed
downward
sliding
scale.
so
that,
in
1957,
the
redemption
price
was
$51
per
share
plus
the
$10
dividend
arrearages.
the
preferred
shares
redeemed
could
not
be
reissued,
but
pursuant
to
provisions
of
the
articles
of
incorporation,
had
to
be
canceled
upon
receipt
or
ultimately
returned
to
the
redeeming
shareholders.
on
april
8,
1957,
respondent’s
directors
proposed
a
three-part
plan
which
they
characterized
as
a
reorganization
of
the
company
by
way
of
a
recapitalization.
the
three
steps
to
the
plan
were
as
follows.
first,
the
directors
proposed
a
series
of
three
amendments
to
the
certificate
of
incorporation.
under
the
first
amendment,
the
preferred
issue
would
be
eliminated.
secondly,
the
par
value
of
the
common
would
be
increased
from
$1
to
$3,
and
an
authorization
of
the
number
of
common
shares
would
be
increased
from
some
763,000
to
1
million
shares.
finally,
the
corporation
was
to
be
authorized
to
issue
warrants
for
the
purchase
of
common
stock.
the
second
part
of
the
plan
involve
the
issuance
of
18-year
bonds
bearing
a
stated
interest
rate
at
5%
and
a
$50
face
amount
to
the
holders
of
the
eliminated
preferred.
these
bonds
were
to
be
subordinate
to
bank
loans
for
inventory
and
to
supply
our
obligations.
the
bonds
were
to
be
redeemable
at
par
plus
accrued
interest
and,
like
the
preferred
stock
for
which
they
were
to
serve
a
substitute,
they
were
subject
to
a
sinking
fund
redemption
provision.
finally,
the
third
step
of
the
plan
was
to
issue
to
the
preferred
shareholders
a
warrant
enabling
them
to
purchase
common
stock.
the
terms
of
the
warrant
were
enable
the
prefer--
the
holders
of
the
eliminated
preferred
to
purchase
one-half
of
a
share
of
common
stock
at
$10
a
share.
this
warrant
was
to
be
in
lieu
of
the
dividend
the
arrearages
of
$10
which
existed
in
1957.
the
shareholders
approved
the
plan
and
the
focus
of
this
case
is
on
the
second
step
of
the
plan.
that
is,
the
issuance
of
bonds
in
substitution
for
the
eliminated
preferred
stock.
a
total
of
some
$2
million
of
face
amount
bonds
were
issued
which
was
exactly
equal
to
the
par
amount
of
the
eliminated
preferred.
thus,
the
capital
of
the
corporation
was
reduced
by
some
$2
million
in
the
preferred
stock
account,
and
the
bonds
payable
account
was
correspondingly
increased
by
the
same
amount.
at
the
time
of
this
transaction
in
1957,
there
had
been
sporadic
transactions
involving,
but
a
few
hundred
shares
on
an
over-the-counter
market
of
respondent’s
preferred
stock.
the
price
range
of
these
transactions
were
bid
ranging
from
$29
to
$33
a
share
and
an
offering
price
of
$32
to
$35
a
share.
respondent
claimed
discount
deductions
for
the
$17
difference
between
the
face
amount
of
each
bond
issued,
that
is,
$50
and
the
asserted
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred
stock
which
was
eliminated,
that
is,
$33.
this
case
involves
the
propriety
of
that
deduction.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
there’s
no
argument
that--
well--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
accuracy
of
that
figure
is
only
questionable
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
sporadic
nature
of
the
transactions
and
since
it
only
involved
but
a
few
hundred
shares
of
the
47,000
shares
outstanding,
but
for
purposes
of
this
case,
there’s
no
argument
that
the
fair
market
value
could
have
been
$33.
the
tax
court
upheld
the
commissioner’s
disallowance
of
the
deduction
in
a
unanimously
reviewed
decision,
but
the
tenth
circuit
reversed
with
one
judge
dissenting.
in
a
series
of
decisions
of
this
court,
this
amortizable
bond
discount
has
been
correctly
recognized
as
essentially
in
the
nature
of
interest.
and,
this
court
has
also
defined
in
numerous
decisions
“interest”
as
the
compensation
for
the
use
of
forbearance
of
money
which
has
long
been
deductible
under
the
income
tax
acts
and
which
is
currently
deductible
under
section
163
of
the
code.
the
best
way
to
understand
how
bond
discount
works,
we
believe,
is
by
reference
to
the
prototype
transaction
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
10.
in
this
prototype
transaction,
a
corporation
issues
a
bond
with
a
face
amount
of
$1,000
bearing
stated
interest
at
a
rate
of
5%
over
a
10-year
term.
the
bond
is
issued
for
$950.
the
stated
interest
of
5%
produces
an
interest
obligation
of
5%
of
$1,000
or
$50
a
year.
but
because
the
issuer
of
the
bond
must
pay
back
to
the
holder
an
additional
$50
after
the
bond
is
retired,
that
additional
$50
is
also
a
cost
of
borrowing
money
and,
as
such,
is
deductible
as
interest.
because
it
is
payable
over
the
term
of
the
bond,
this
court
and
appropriate
treasury
regulations
have
permitted
a
ratable
deduction
over
the
term
of
the
bond
or
amortization,
if
you
will.
thus,
the
allowable
deduction
to
the
issuer
on
the
prototype
bond
would
be
$55
a
year
and
not
$50
a
year.
the
critical
question
in
this
case
is
whether
this
transaction
is
analogous
to
the
prototype
transaction.
here,
we
have
a
situation
where
the
corporation
issued
a
$50
debenture
in
substitution
for
a
share
of
eliminated
$50
par
preferred
stock.
there’s
no
question
that
respondent,
upon
the
original
issuance
of
the
preferred
stock,
received
$50
in
the
corporate
teal,
so
to
speak.
it
has
now
transformed
that
preferred
stock
investment
into
a
liability
which
will
be
payable
over
an
18--
at
the
end
of
18
years.
it
originally
received
this
$50
and
it
now
promises
to
pay
$50
out
over
the
end
of
the
term.
this
equivalence
has
been
reflected
in
the
journal
entries
of
respondent
which
--
for
they
have
reduced
their
capital
account
by
the
$50
par
amount
for
each
bond
--
for
each
preferred
stock
share
which
has
been
eliminated
and
have
increased
their
bonds
payable
account
by
a
like
amount.
this
simple
substitution
of
one
security
for
another
does
not
involve
an
obligation
to
pay
in
the
future
any
more
than
the
$50
originally
received
for
the
preferred
stock.
and,
we
believe
that
as
a
matter
of
numerical
equivalence
there
can
be
no
discount
in
such
a
transaction.
now,
respondent
and
the
tenth
circuit
have
focused
on
these
sporadic
sales
of
the
preferred
shares
at
$33
a
share.
it
held
that
there
was
$17
of
discount
on
the
issuance
of
each
debenture.
but,
recalling
that
discount
simply
involves
an
obligation
to
pay
in
excess
of
an
amount
borrowed
just
as
the
corporation
in
the
prototype
transaction
has
promised
to
pay
$1,000
although
it
has
only
borrowed
$950,
we
submit
that
there
is
no
such
excess
in
this
case.
for
discount
to
exist
in
this
case,
the
amount
borrowed
must
be
somehow
analogous
to
the
$33
in
the
same
way
that
the
$950
in
cash
is
analogous
to
the
amount
borrowed
in
the
prototype
transaction.
but
unlike
the
prototype
transaction
where
the
corporation
has
fully
available
$950
of
cash
for
its
use
in
the
business,
here,
all
respondent
has
is
a
certificate
of
its
preferred
stock
which
is
immediately
canceled
by
the
terms
of
the
articles
of
incorporation.
thus,
the
so-called
$33
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred
stock
is
meaningless
to
the
respondent
and
in
no
sense,
can
it
be
said
to
have
received
$33
in
a
borrowing
transaction.
now,
respondent
disputes
this
analysis.
it
argues
that
it
only
entered
into
this
transaction
because
it
did
not
have
$33
in
cash
to
redeem
its
preferred
shares.
as
a
result,
it
had
to
issue
bonds
in
the
face
amount
of
$50
and
the
argument
goes
that
the
$17
of
excess
is
interest
or
deductible
discount.
it
analogizes
its
preferred
shareholders
through
a
so
called
financing
medium,
as
it
uses
the
term
in
its
brief.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
life
of
the
bond
here
was
18
years.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
but
respondent’s
argument
assumes
that
it
could
have
redeemed
$33
for
cash,
but
recalling
that
the
preferred
shareholders
were
entitled
to
a
redemption
price
of
$51
a
share
in
1957
plus
the
$10
of
dividend
arrearages,
this
is
a
$61
obligation
per
share
to
each
preferred
shareholder
and
not
a
$33
obligation.
there
is
no
basis
for
inferring
that
the
excess
over
the
asserted
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred
stock
is
a
cost
for
the
use
of
borrowing
money.
indeed,
the
inference
that
discount
exists
in
this
case
becomes
even
weaker
when
we
recall
that
the
bonds
themselves
bore
a
stated
interest
rate
of
5%.
indeed,
if
respondent
had
redeemed
the
shares
for
cash
at
any
price,
the
cases
are
clear
that
it
would
be
entitled
to
no
income
tax
deduction
at
all.
it
therefore
becomes
apparent
that
it
is
simply
absurd
to
infer
a
$17
deduction
for
deductible
interest
when
the
redemption
price
was
possibly
as
much
as
$61.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
kind
of
analogy
was
one
of
the
basis
of
the
reasoning
of
the
court
below
and,
we
feel
that
it
is
simply
a
variation,
as
i
will
point
out,
of
respondent’s
financing
medium
argument.
the
tenth
--
what
the
tenth
circuit
did
was
to
analogize
the
transaction
and
to
break
it
down
into
two
elements:
one,
the
issuance
of
a
bond
--
$50
face
amount
bond
for
$33
in
cash
and
then
the
use
of
the
$33
in
cash
to
redeem
the
preferred
shares.
the
court
claimed
that,
looking
at
the
transaction
that
way,
that
there
would’ve
been
discount
as
a
result
of
the
first
aspect
of
the
transaction,
but
this
analogy,
we
feel,
is
erroneous
from
several
different
perspectives.
first
of
all,
it
is
the
transaction
at
issue
here,
the
unified
transaction
which
must
be
scrutinized
and
not
a
break
down
into
what
we
regard
as
hypothetical
nonexistent
components,
but
there
are
also
two
factual
misapprehensions
about
the
analogy.
to
begin
with,
it
is
entirely
unsupported
in
the
record
to
make
an
assumption
that
respondent
could
have
reissued
a
$50
--
if
it
had
issued
a
$50
bond
in
1957,
it
would
have
only
received
$33
in
cash,
especially
unsupported
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
bond
itself
carried
a
stated
interest
rate.
but,
as
i’ve
also
pointed
out,
there
is
no
basis
for
assuming
that
respondent
could
have
redeemed
its
preferred
shares
for
$33
in
cash
because
the
redemption
price
in
1957
was
$61.
and
if
this
$61
obligation
was
settled
for
$50
which
got
put
on
the
face
amount
of
the
bond,
there
is
no
reason
to
infer
that
any
part
of
that
$50
is
the
cost
of
borrowing.
now,
even
if
respondent
had
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
there’s
no
obligation
--
there
was
no
obligation.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
could
have.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
worth
$33,
but
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
in
the
market.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right,
but
not
worth
$33
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
he
had
no
right
to
compel
redemption,
but
if
redemption
were
to
be
affected
as
it
was
in
this
case,
it
had
to
be
--
it
could
have
--
the
shareholders
could
have
insisted
on
$61
per
share.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
had
there
been
redemption.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
in
exchange
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that’s
correct,
but
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
exactly
and
we
feel
that
the
tenth
circuit,
having
done
so,
that
it
was
error
to
have
done
that.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
because
this
was
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
okay.
well,
if
we
look
at
it
that
way,
the
--
first
of
all,
there
was
--
the
corporation
did
not
receive
property
worth
to
it
$33
in
the
same
way
that
the
corporation,
the
prototype
transaction,
received
an
amount
less
than
an
amount
which
it
obligated
itself
to
pay
in
the
future.
there
was
no
excess
--
obligation
to
pay
an
excess
over
an
amount
borrowed.
here,
the
numerical
equivalence
is
such
that
the
corporation
originally
took
in
$50
for
its
preferred
shares.
it
has
transformed
that
into
a
$50
liability
and
we
believe
that
the
$33
to
have
--
that
the
reference
to
the
$33
asserted
fair
market
value
of
preferred
shares
becomes
irrelevant
because
this
is
simply
a
substitution
of
one
security
for
another.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
a
bookkeeping
transaction
in
the
sense
that
it
is
a
reshuffling
of
one
security
for
another,
technically
called
a
recapitalization.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
are
different.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
are
different
kinds
of
securities,
but
we
don’t
think
that
makes
any
difference
in
this
case.
in
fact,
the
similarities,
mr.
chief
justice,
far
outweigh
the
differences
because
just
as
the
bonds
was
subordinate
to
supply
our
obligations
in
bank
loans,
the
preferred
shareholders
were
also
subordinate
--
could
only
get
their
$50
upon
a
voluntary
liquidation
of
the
corporation,
so
to
speak.
so
that,
both
really
stood
in
somewhat
the
same
position.
we
think
that
the
similarities
far
outweigh
the
differences.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
from
a
corporate
point
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that
is
from
a
technical
corporate
point
of
view,
that’s
correct.
but,
we
don’t
think
that
should
make
any
difference
in
this
case
where
we
have
simply
$50
going
into
the
corporation
through
the
par
value
of
preferred
stock.
there’s
no
dispute
that
the
corporation
received
$50
and
then
it
simply
promises
to
pay
$50
in
the
future.
discount
involves
the
existence
of
an
obligation
to
pay
something
in
excess
of
an
amount
borrowed
and
there
was
no
obligation
here
to
pay
anything
in
excess
of
the
$50
the
corporation
originally
received
on
the
issuance
of
its
preferred
stock.
finally,
the
tenth
circuit’s
analogy
becomes
--
flies
squarely
in
the
face,
we
believe,
of
this
court’s
decision
in
great
western
power
company
versus
commissioner,
specifically
held
that
such
a
substitution
of
one
security
for
another
is
a
unified
transaction
and
not
a
transaction
involving
a
breakdown
of
the
issuance
of
the
second
one
for
the
cash
and
the
elimination
--
and
then
the
use
of
that
cash
to
eliminate
the
first
security.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
tenth
circuit
misconceived
the
basic
essentials
of
these
transactions.
so,
what
we
have
here
is
simply
the
substitution
of
one
security
for
another
and
we
submit
that
a
corporation’s
issuance
of
debentures
for
stock
is
simply
a
capital
readjustment
that
does
not
give
rise,
with
those
facts
alone,
to
an
inference
of
the
existence
--
for
the
existence
of
discount.
this
--
thus,
the
$33
asserted
market
value
of
preferred
shares
becomes
completely
irrelevant.
and
the
correctness
of
this
proposition,
we
believe,
is
amply
demonstrated
by
two
things
in
this
case
where
you
have
a
dollar-for-dollar
exchange
and
where,
as
a
matter
of
corporate
mechanics,
the
corporation
received
nothing
upon
the
exchange
because
the
stock
was
immediately
canceled.
now,
the
tax
court
decided
this
case
on
the
basis
of
a
dollar-for-dollar
exchange
and
in
so
holding,
it
followed
the
reasoning
of
a
series
of
recent
court
of
claims
decisions
which
had
also
premised
the
nonexistence
of
discount
in
transactions
like
these
on
a
dollar-for-dollar
equivalence
between
the
par
value
of
the
eliminated
preferred
stock
and
the
face
amount
of
the
bond.
now,
we
think
while
this
rationale
is
certainly
sufficient
to
reverse
the
judgment
below,
there
are
other
ramifications
of
this
problem
which
we
believe
this
court
should
consider
in
formulating
a
basis
for
its
decision.
as
i’ve
said,
as
a
general
proposition,
we
do
not
believe
that
a
capital
readjustment
of
this
type
gives
rise
to
amortizable
bond
discount.
consider
the
situation
of
the
corporation
having
issued
a
$55
face
amount
bond
for
the
$50
preferred
stock.
in
such
a
situation,
we
still
think
that
there
is
no
basis
for
inferring
bond
discount.
now,
the
court
of
claims
has
suggested
and
two
district
courts
have
more
explicitly
held
that
discount
might
arise
in
such
a
transaction.
a
district
court
decision
has
proposed
a
formula
for
the
measurement
of
discount
in
the
following
transaction
which
would
be
as
follows.
it
would
measure
the
difference
between
the
face
amount
of
the
bond
in
the
example
of
$55
and
the
greater
of
the
following
two
quantities.
first,
the
par
value
of
the
stock,
here
$50
or
the
value
of
the
preferred
stock
to
the
corporation
at
the
time
of
the
exchange.
now,
under
the
district
court’s
formula,
the
value
to
the
corporation
of
the
preferred
stock
may
be
greater
than
the
par
value
of
the
preferred
stock,
but
could
in
no
instance
be
less
than
the
par
value.
thus,
for
purposes
of
the
example,
under
the
district
court’s
approach
there
could
be
as
much
as
$5
of
discount
in
this
transaction
in
the
$55
--
50
transaction,
but
might
be
less.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it’s
not
entirely
clear,
mr.
justice
stewart,
exactly
what
the
district
court
had
in
mind
and
that
is
one
of
our
complaints
about
this
test.
we
think
that
the
concept
of
value
to
the
corporation
introduces
as
vague
and
meaningless
term.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
on
a
redemption.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
problem
with
that
kind
of
analysis
is
that
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
but
as
--
simply,
as
a
matter
of
realistic
market
mechanics,
i
would
assume
that
if
the
corporation
here
attempted
to
buy
up
as
many
shares
as
it
could
on
the
open
market
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
it’s
intention
to
retire
the
whole
issue
would’ve
become
apparent
and
the
market
price
would’ve
been
pushed
up
toward
the
redemption
price.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
it’s
not
entirely
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
don’t
think
the
courts
quite
understand
what
the
value
to
the
corporation
means
because
the
court
of
claims
has
suggested
that
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred
stock
is
a
relevant
consideration
for
determining
the
value
to
the
corporation,
but
it
is
not
a
determinant
consideration.
thus,
it
seems
that
the
courts
know
that
they
want
to
get
away
from
this
approach
once
they
get
away
from
fair
market
value
which,
of
course,
we
also
contend
is
erroneous,
but
it’s
not
clear
to
the
courts
exactly
what
this
term
“value
to
the
corporation”
is.
now,
whatever
it
is,
we
submit
that
there
still
is
no
basis
for
an
inference
that
discount
arises
in
such
a
transaction.
to
begin
with,
if
the
term
“value
to
the
corporation”
means
what
the
corporation
would
be
willing
to
pay
for
the
preferred
stock,
then
even
under
the
district
court’s
formula
there
would
be
no
discount
because
there
would
be
a
face
amount
of
$55
for
the
bond
and
the
corporation
would
be
willing
to
pay
$55
for
the
stock.
thus,
there
would
be
no
element
of
that
$50
--
$55
figure
would
constitute
a
cost
of
borrowing.
indeed,
there
are
many
instances
which
we
might
call
to
mind
to
suggest
why
a
corporation
would
be
willing
to
purchase
its
preferred
stock
for
more
than
its
par
value.
there
could
be
a
call
premium,
or
whatever,
which
might
force
the
corporation
to
be
required
to
pay
from
its
shareholder
more
than
the
par
value
of
the
stock.
so,
if
that
value
to
the
corporation
means
the
price
at
which
the
corporation
pays
for
the
stock,
there
would
be
no
discount.
but,
even
conversely,
if
the
face
amount
of
the
bond
represents
somewhat
more
than
the
corporation
would
be
willing
to
pay
for
the
stock,
there
is
still
no
reason
to
infer
the
existence
of
discount.
there
are
varieties
of
other
corporate
reasons
completely
unrelated
to
the
cost
of
borrowing
money
which
could
form
a
basis
for
understanding
why
a
corporation
would
enter
into
a
transaction
like
this.
for
example,
in
this
very
case,
respondent
could
have
--
respondent
wanted
to
eliminate
the
dividend
arrearages.
it
could’ve
decided
that
it
wanted
to
transform
nondeductible
dividends
on
preferred
stock
into
deductible
interests.
it
could’ve
decided
it
wanted
to
eliminate
the
preferred
shares
which
were
held
by
a
dissident
group.
in
any
event,
we
submit
that
there
are
varieties
of
other
independent
reasons
which
would
form
the
basis
of
a
decision
why
a
corporation
would
be
willing
to
pay
more
for
its
preferred
stock
than
the
so-called
market
value
or
its
value
to
the
corporation
which
are
totally
unrelated
to
the
cost
of
borrowing
money.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
did
vote
as
a
class
and,
in
fact,
voted
on
this
very
plan.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
as
--
i
think,
simply,
it
was
a
much
smaller
class.
i
think
it
was
share-for-share.
i’m
not
exactly
sure.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
par
view
of
shares.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
not
that
i’m
aware
of.
i
see
that
i
have
little
time
left.
i
would
like
to
save
it
for
rebuttal
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
just
a
few
points.
mr.
justice
blackmun
asked
about
the
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred
stock.
the
reference
in
this
stipulation
in
the
tax
court
is
at
page
27
of
the
record,
paragraph
13.
there
was
no
stipulation
between
the
parties
with
respect
to
fair
market
value.
all
the
stipulation
says,
is
attached
hereto
and
marked
as
exhibit
17,
is
a
letter
from
francis
i.
dupont
and
company
in
which
the
bid
and
ask
range
prices
are
quoted.
that’s
the
only
thing
in
the
record
with
respect
to
the
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred
stock.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
no,
because
from
our
point
of
view
the
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred,
whatever
the
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred
stock,
doesn’t
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
--
doesn’t
make
any
difference.
since
discount
involves
an
obligation
to
pay
an
amount
in
excess
of
an
amount
borrowed,
we
don’t
think
that
there
was
anything
in
excess
of
$50.
with
respect
to
the
similarities
and
difference
--
alleged
differences,
between
the
preferred
stock
and
the
debentures,
let
me
just
refer
the
court
to
the
discussion
on
pages
14
and
15
of
our
brief
in
which
it
is
pointed
out
that
both
the
preferred
stock
and
the
debentures
were
both
subject
to
comparable
sinking
fund
provisions
which
would
retire
both
of
them.
i
think
that
simply,
as
a
matter
of
realism,
both
the
preferred
shareholders
here
and
the
debenture
holders
were
both
subject
to
the
risk
of
the
business.
if
the
business
didn’t
make
any
money,
then
the
debenture
holders
wouldn’t
get
paid
nor
would
the
preferred
shareholder’s
investment
really
be
worth
anything.
i
think
in
closing,
what
i
simply
want
to
emphasize
is
what
the
taxpayer
is
arguing
for
here
is
an
automatic
rule
which
would
insist
upon
the
existence
of
discount
between
the
face
amount
of
the
debenture
and
the
asserted
fair
market
value
of
the
preferred
stock.
we
say,
on
those
facts
alone,
there
is
no
basis
for
inferring
discount
and
that
the
basis
of
the
lack
of
discount
is
graphically
illustrated
in
this
case
by
the
equivalence
between
the
par
value
of
the
preferred
stock
and
the
base
amount
of
the
debenture.
the
corporation
took
in
$50
and
promised
to
pay
out
no
more
than
$50
over
the
end
of
the
term.
but
simply,
if
the
corporation
had
increased
the
face
amounts
of
the
debenture,
we
do
not
think
--
it’s
$55,
we
don’t
think
that
there
is
a
basis
for
inferring
the
existence
of
discount.
we
think
that
the
taxpayer
should
be
put
to
the
burden
of
demonstrating
that
that
excess
really
represents
the
cost
of
borrowing
and
that
since
that
there
are
a
variety
of
reasons
why
a
corporation
would
want
to
enter
into
a
transaction
like
this
--
i
see
my
time
is
up,
i’ll
just
finish
my
sentence,
we
think
that
those
reasons
should
control
unless
there
is
strong
evidence
inferring
an
additional
cost
of
bond.
thank
you.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
do
not
think
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
we
have
filed
the
reply
brief,
mr.
justice
powell,
which
discusses
this
point.
briefly,
we
do
not
attach
any
significant
--
any
really
significance
to
the
1969
amendment.
but,
we
do
note
that
the
approach
of
congress
in
1969
is
parallel
to
the
approach
we
would
take
in
this
case.
that,
as
a
general
rule,
when
a
corporation
issues
bonds
for
property,
congress
has
declared
in
1969
that
the
issue
price
is
equal
to
the
face
amount
of
the
bond
with
only
two
exceptions,
that
either
the
bonds
be
traded
on
a
public
exchange,
or
that
the
stock
be
traded
on
a
public
exchange.
neither
of
those
facts
exists
in
this
case,
and
we
think
that
the
general
rule
without
the
exceptions
lend
support
and
is
parallel
to
the
approach
we
take
here.
