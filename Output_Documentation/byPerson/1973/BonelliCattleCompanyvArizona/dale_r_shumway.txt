mr.
dale
r.
shumway
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
perhaps
outline
a
little
different
view
of
some
of
these
facts
because
i
believe
the
facts
are
material
to
what
we
are
talking
about.
for
the
sake
of
clarity
in
the
brief
of
respondents
beginning
at
page
five,
we
have
inserted
copies
of
the
pertinent
exhibits
which
we
feel
will
give
the
court
an
understanding
of
where
this
river
was
or
it
is
today.
at
page
five
is
a
copy
of
exhibit
k
which
was
submitted
to
the
court
at
the
trial
level.
it’s
the
1902
topographic
map
which
has
been
prepared
by
the
geological
survey.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
page
five
of
the
respondent’s
brief.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
this
is
the
same
map
which
was
shown
a
moment
ago
by
mr.
coker.
it
shows
the
subject
land
being
in
section
three
which
is
over
a
mile
distance
from
the
colorado
river
as
it
was
surveyed
under
this
topographic
map.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
in
your
looking
at
this,
that
the
colorado
river
in
the
stage
that
it
was
at
the
time
of
that
survey
was
a
low
stage.
it
wasn’t
the
river
as
it
existed
in
an
annual
high
flow
stage.
for
perhaps
familiar
already,
the
colorado
river
is
a
river
that
traditionally
before
the
days
of
boulder
dam
drained
the
water
shed
of
the
colorado
and
when
it
did,
it
ran
in
the
late
spring
and
the
early
summer
months.
so
the
only
period
of
time
that
that
river
really
had
a
high
flow
stage
was
during
that
particular
part
of
the
year.
any
other
time
it
was
rather
a
docile
river
and
sometimes
had
very
low
water
in
it
and
all
of
the
surveys
that
i
know
anything
about
were
done
at
the
time
the
river
was
low.
and
so
you
see
on
exhibit
k
that’s
on
page
five
of
respondent’s
brief,
an
approximate
location
of
that
low
flow
but
you
see
also
to
the
right
of
the
subject
land
a
500-foot
to
550-foot
contour.
and
for
showing
it
on
this
big
map,
the
550-foot
contour
is
clear
off
in
this
area.
the
subject
land
is
the
red
and
it
is
way
over
here.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that’s
the
dotted
line.
the
next
exhibit
that
i
inserted
in
the
respondent’s
brief
is
at
page
six.
this
is
a
copy
of
the
general
land
survey
of
1906
which
for
all
intensive
purposes
was
the
statehood
survey
for
arizona
and
at
that
time,
the
colorado
river
had
moved
to
a
point
where
it
had
nearly
gone
into
the
southwest
corner
of
the
subject
land.
now,
this
was
1906
and
in
relation
to
mr.
justice
white’s
argument
about
whether
it
was
riparian
or
not,
i
would
just
say
that
this
is
the
closest
date
we
have
to
determine
whether
it
was
a
riparian
land.
now
the
strict
doctrine
of
riparianship
says
that
land
must
be
bordering
a
navigable
stream.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
and
this
is
not
at
the
closest
survey
we
had.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
it’s
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
i
would
have
to
say
i
do
not
know
and
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
in
complete
candid,
i
have
to
say
we
did
everything
possible
to
determine
where
this
river
was
at
a
particular
time.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
1912.
now
there
are
two
questions
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
perhaps
this
is
a
good
time
to
make
a
statement
of
this
particular
problem.
i
represented
the
state
of
arizona
in
a
case
called
claridge
versus
the
united
states.
the
supreme
court
denied
certainly
that
a
few
years
ago.
that
case
arose
in
the
early
blithe,
california
and
if
you’re
familiar
with
blithe,
the
river
in
that
area
is
--
the
river
valley
is
approximately
15
to
20
miles
wide.
there
is
no
doubt
that
that
river
has
run
over
all
of
that
area
at
some
time.
some
time
prehistoric,
the
river
was
completely
across
that
valley
just
as
it
was
across
this
complete
area
here.
in
the
claridge
decision,
the
state
of
arizona
took
the
position
that
the
river
bed
that
the
state
of
arizona
took
title
to
at
statehood
was
that
total
area
wherever
the
river
completely
took
the
land
during
that
high
flow
stage.
now
the
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
yes,
at
any
time
in
history
and
particular
at
anytime
subsequent
to
the
united
states
being
there.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
it’s
a
big
irrigation
ditch
and
so
our
position
was
this
in
claridge
that
we
own
a
much
larger
area
and
that
then
begs
the
question
of
whether
the
united
states
could
convey
away
pieces
of
land
like
this
and
thousands
of
other
partials
up
and
down
the
river.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
before
statehood.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
well
they
could
not
because
under
the
pollard
decision
they
would
have
reserved
that
land
for
the
states
to
be
created.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
the
claridge
card
held
that
no
--
the
river
was
not
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
yes,
they
said
that
no,
you
do
not
go
out
that
far
to
this
if
you
place
550-foot
contour
on
exhibit
k.
you
go
where
the
river
is
today,
that
is
basically
what
claridge
held.
you
go
where
it
is
today
which
will
then
reduce
us
to
a
narrow
configuration
and
so
even
if
we’re
reduced
to
that
configuration
i
think
we
question
whether
bonelli
was
riparian.
there
is
no
proof
that
he
was.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
no.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
and
i’ll
tell
you
right
now
why.
i
don’t
think
he’s
right
even
then
because
the
state
of
arizona
owns
the
bed
of
a
navigable
stream
wherever
it
is.
and
what
we
have
in
this
case,
is
the
river
moving
from
its
position
in
1903
until
1906
when
it
was
still
apparently
not
on
the
land.
then
we
have
the
next
location
and
i
put
that
at
page
nine
on
my
brief,
which
is
the
1960
revision
of
a
topographic
map
filed
by
the
officer
of
river
control
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
and
at
that
time,
as
you
can
see
from
that
exhibit,
the
river
had
inundated
almost
the
entire
track
of
land
and
that
is
the
last
natural,
if
we
disregard
boulder
dam
in
its
effect,
this
is
the
last
natural
as
natural
as
that
can
be.
now,
i
think
we
have
to
start
from
that
particular
point.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
it’s
actually
a
1950
seven-and-a-half
minute
quadrangle
sheet
published
by
the
geologic
survey.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
was
this
particular
map
that
is
exhibit
e1
and
the
letter
that
is
attached
to
it
in
the
agreed
statement
of
facts
says
that
it
obtained
in
1952.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
‘52
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
and
was
updated
for
the
sake
of
re-channelization
to
1960.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
and
so
immediately
before
the
united
states
went
in
to
re-channelize
that,
this
is
the
configuration
of
the
“natural
river”.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that
is
substantially
correct.
i
would
call
you
attention
to
page
12
of
the
respondent’s
brief
which
is
actually
a
resurvey
of
the
same
thing.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that’s
correct,
when
the
river
have
been
over
to
the
west,
we
have
lost
that,
we
have
transferred
ownership
of
the
riverbed
to
the
now
existing
stream
and
while
i
called
your
attention
to
page
12,
that’s
dependent
resurvey
by
the
bureau
of
land
management
that
is
actually
the
survey
agency
and
they
locate
the
old
left
bank
of
the
colorado
river
before
re-channelization.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
yes,
yes
a
dependent
resurvey
and
they
have
located
a
little
bit
further
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
i
do
not
believe
it’s
dependent.
i
think
it’s
a
resurvey.
if
i
am
correct,
i’ll
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
it’s
a
resurvey.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
it’s
a
resurvey.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
what
it
does
is
it
reduces
the
amount
of
land
that’s
left
outside
the
river
slightly
and
so
it’s
our
positions
from
those
three
or
those
particular
exhibits
that
we’ve
got
nothing
more
than
an
accretive
movement
of
the
river
and
you
secure
that
agreement
from
counsel
for
the
petitioner
that
he
agrees
that
there
has
been
an
accretion.
that
accretion
moved
the
bed
of
the
river
over
until
it
completely,
except
for
the
60
acres
in
the
southwest
or
the
southeast
corner,
inundated
the
subject
land
and
at
that
particular
moment,
the
state
of
arizona
and
nevada
owned
the
bed
of
the
colorado
river
even
though
it
was
on
his
land
and
there
had
been
no
taking
by
anyone
except
the
actions
of
the
river.
the
land
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
river.
sometimes
i
don’t
think
the
doctrine
of
accretion
is
as
sound
as
it
ought
to
be
but
it
is
the
doctrine
that
is
pretty
well
substantiated
by
all
law
in
this
country.
and
that
doctrine
of
accretion
includes
not
only
the
affect
upon
private
lands
as
one
of
the
justices
asked
but
it
also
carries
with
it
the
ownership
of
the
bed
of
the
stream.
its
effect
is
upon
the
riparian
land,
its
effect
is
likewise
upon
the
bed
of
the
stream
which
is
owned
by
the
states.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
reliction,
of
course
reliction
is
the
withdrawal
of
water
and
i
would
have
to
say
reliction
is
a
doctrine
which
is
similar
to
accretion
and
the
law
is
the
same
in
that
sort
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
well,
definitely
mr.
justice,
i
would
agree
so.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
very
correct.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
well
not
so,
i
do
not
believe
well
and
then
we
get
into
the
question
of
the
man-made
effect.
there’s
a
bunch
of
cases
in
the
body
of
law
which
says
if
accretion
or
reliction
was
caused
by
some
upstream
effect
and
it
was
not
designed
for
this
particular
purpose
then
it
is
not
the
same
or
it
is
the
same,
excuse
me.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
in
this
particular
case
we’re
not
talking
about
that,
we’re
talking
about
a
specific
act
which
came
in
to
reduce
the
flow,
to
constrict
the
river.
that
was
the
purpose
of
re-channelization.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that
is
for
all
the
law
that
i
can
find
on
it
that
it
tantamount
to
an
evulsion.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
yes
sir.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
this
is
substantially
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
and
the
only
thing
that
i
think
remains
that
i
want
to
emphasize
is
this,
i
think
there
are
two
real
questions
in
this.
and
the
first
one
involves
the
location
of
the
ordinary
high
water
mark
with
reference
to
boulder
dam
and
its
effect.
i’m
deeply
convinced
that
boulder
dam
took
a
great
body
of
land
out
of
the
state’s
ownership
by
reducing
the
stream
bed.
and
i
urge
that
in
the
other
court
and
they
did
never
get
the
chance
to
get
to
this
court
whether
i
think
it’s
a
matter
that
ought
to
be
considered.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
the
reliction,
an
ordinary
reliction,
mr.
justice
white.
it
would’ve
been
a
reliction
because
they
reduced
the
water
and
the
only
problem
with
that
decision
is
that
it
would
be
very
effective
adversely
economically
on
a
tremendous
quantity
of
land.
it
would
be
a
very
harsh
thing
and
i
think
the
law
supports
it
but
i
have
a
hard
time
following
it
all
the
way
in
today’s
modern
times
in
40
years
since
boulder
dam.
the
other
thing
that
i
think
this
decision
needs
is
a
real
determination
as
to
the
effect
of
that
question
is.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that
question
--
yes
it
is,
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
came
into
the
case
through
justice
struckmeyer
there
on
the
supreme
court.
we
didn’t
assert
it
because
we
felt
claridge
had
pretty
well
decided
the
issue
and
when
this
court
denied
we
did
not
assert
that.
but
mr.
justice
struckmeyer
brought
it
back
in,
said
that
is
the
law
and
the
boundary
up
to
be
somewhere
out
here.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
well
in
that
event
the
state
of
arizona
and
the
states
of
california
respectively
nevada
could
own
an
awful
lot
more
of
land
that’s
along
the
boarder
of
this
stream.
now
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that’s
very
much
correct.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
it’s
a
boundary
now,
mr.
justice
white
that
has
been
established
in
the
center
of
the
re-channelization.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
yes,
by
compact
between
the
states
that
has
been
approved
by
congress.
that’s
shown
clearly
at
page
12.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
and
that
is
the
boundary
now
between
the
states.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
very
definitely
and
i
do
not
dispute
that.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
well,
it
is
in
the
fact
that
there
are
large
bodies
of
land
that
are
still
litigated
between
the
united
states.
that
is
what
claridge
was
and
there’s
substantially
other
records
like
it.
there’s
also
an
important
point
before
my
time
runs
out,
i
ought
to
mention
this.
in
the
re-channelization
process
of
the
colorado
river
in
many
places,
the
river
has
been
moved
subsequent
to
the
determination
of
statehood
boundary
and
for
example
i
might
say
that
we’ve
taken
this
river
and
physically
moved
it
over
here
and
re-channelized
it
and
there
remains
a
bed
that
was
abandoned.
and
i
think
there
are
13
such
instances
from
this
point
down
to
yuma.
arizona
and
california
have
wondered
for
a
long
time
what
to
do
about
this.
in
other
words
there
is
land
in
arizona
that
belongs
to
california
and
land
in
california
that
belongs
to
arizona
which
is
prior
beds
of
the
river
and
we
are
there
now
in
the
process
of
trying
to
get
together
and
perhaps
workout
some
trades
which
are
specifically
allowed
under
the
boundary
compact.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that
does
not
affect
the
boundaries.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
no.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that
is
correct
and
the
boundary
compacts
specifically
says
it
does
not
affect
title
to
land.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
the
boundary
would
have
continued
to
change,
that
was
the
real
problem.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that’s
probably
correct.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
mr.
coker
referred
to
one
case
which
the
earliest
case
in
arizona
that
dealt
with
the
accretion
doctrine
was
the
jacobs
case
which
is
cited
in
all
our
briefs
and
it
happened
to
be
a
rape
case
and
the
involvement
where
the
accretion
and
evulsion
doctrine
had
to
do
with
boundary.
and
that
was
the
first
time
my
court
ever
spoke
upon
the
doctrine
of
accretion
evulsion.
very
strange
form
to
get
to
that
subject.
but
since
then
they
have
had
two
or
three
other
cases
which
have
adopted
the
doctrine.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
there
are
no
cases
mr.
justice
white
i
know
of.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
i
don’t
believe
there
are
any
cases
which
say
accretion
and
evulsion
apply
only
to
private
people.
it
applies
to
all
those
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
yes,
it
applies
in
all
essence
of
before
you
are
dealing
with
a
navigable
stream.
but
there’s
no
distinguishing.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
yes,
i
think
the
oklahoma
versus
texas
case
and
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
in
which
private
parties?
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
well,
i’m
just
saying
that
there
are
other
lands
up
and
down
that
river,
i
don’t
say
that
there
are
parties
to
it.
those
are
not
here.
they’re
not
here,
the
only
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
bonelli
cattleand
this
is
what
the
case
is
about.
the
only
effect
i
see
on
it
is
that
there
are
numerous
other
similar
acres
of
land
that
are
situated
in
the
identical
situation
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
well,
i
would
hope
so.
we
spent
about
15
years
in
arizona
trying
to
make
some
law
which
would
guide
us
in
these
areas
and
that’s
why
we
are
here.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that
is
correct.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that
is
correct.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
they
uncovered
the
state
of
arizona’s
land,
bonelli
had
resisted.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
the
facts
are
that
it
had
--
the
river
had
acquired
the
land
and
that
became
the
bed
of
the
stream
the
state
owned
and
at
that
moment
bonelli
did
not
own
it.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
he
didn’t
own
anything
and
he
did
not
get
it
back
by
the
action
of
the
united
states,
that
is
not
submergence
and
reappearances
has
been
suggested.
it’s
not
reliction;
it’s
merely
an
evulsion
that
speeded
up
the
process
of
changing
the
channel
of
a
river.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that
is.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
no,
because
all
the
parties
have
agreed
that
it
is
an
evulsion.
in
fact,
the
brief
of
the
petitioner
specifically
agrees
to
that.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
i
would
agree
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
all
of
the
--
the
only
two
i
can
think
of
is
one
that
is
called
california
case
and
it
is
cited
in
the
brief,
and
i
have
to
dig
it
out
and
a
marine
railway
case
which
his
the
patomic
river
case
and
it’s
also
cited
both
the
united
states
in
our
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
well,
this
one
is
the
patomic
and
it
was
in
the
area
of
building
out
from
the
boundary
of
maryland
and
it’s
not
specifically
on
bed
stream.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
the
reason
we
didn’t
and
you
notice
we
joined
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
reason
we
joined
in
it
and
brought
it
up
here
to
try
to
see
if
we
can
secure
a
stamp
on
this
ordinary
high
water
mark
law
is
because
we
are
concerned
with
where
is
it.
what
are
we
to
do
in
arizona
with
relation
to
other
lands,
which
maybe
federal
is
claridge
binding
on
us.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
if
it
was
not
riparian,
mr.
justice
white,
you’re
probably
correct
and
we
shouldn’t
even
be
here
but
we
feel
that
there
is
enough
doubt
that
it
is
and
i
would
admit
for
the
sake
of
getting
the
decision
that
it
maybe
is,
was
riparian
in
that
particular
time
and
it
still
does
not
make
any
difference
because
of
the
doctrine
of
riverbed
ownership.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
exactly,
very
much.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
completely.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that’s
correct.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
and
basically
i
think
hughes
announced
as
a
federal
law
which
is
probably
the
same
as
the
common
law
of
arizona
and
the
case
law
under
two
or
three
decisions
which
have
remotely
considered
the
question.
although
there
are
some
other
questions
that
have
been
discussed
basically
the
one
on
estoppel.
i
feel
i
should
just
mention
it
that
i
do
not
believe
there’s
much
there
that
indicate
that
the
state
of
arizona
has
done
anything
which
brings
it
within
the
requirement
of
an
estoppel
position.
i
don’t
believe
we
have
any
problems
there
and
i’ve
suggested
so
in
the
brief.
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
arizona
supreme
court,
if
we
are
considering
the
land
was
riparian
and
bringing
the
federal
question
into
bare
should
be
affirmed
and
that
the
land
should
belong
to
the
state
of
arizona.
thank
you.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
perhaps
outline
a
little
different
view
of
some
of
these
facts
because
i
believe
the
facts
are
material
to
what
we
are
talking
about.
for
the
sake
of
clarity
in
the
brief
of
respondents
beginning
at
page
five,
we
have
inserted
copies
of
the
pertinent
exhibits
which
we
feel
will
give
the
court
an
understanding
of
where
this
river
was
or
it
is
today.
at
page
five
is
a
copy
of
exhibit
k
which
was
submitted
to
the
court
at
the
trial
level.
it’s
the
1902
topographic
map
which
has
been
prepared
by
the
geological
survey.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
page
five
of
the
respondent’s
brief.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
this
is
the
same
map
which
was
shown
a
moment
ago
by
mr.
coker.
it
shows
the
subject
land
being
in
section
three
which
is
over
a
mile
distance
from
the
colorado
river
as
it
was
surveyed
under
this
topographic
map.
i
would
like
to
point
out,
in
your
looking
at
this,
that
the
colorado
river
in
the
stage
that
it
was
at
the
time
of
that
survey
was
a
low
stage.
it
wasn’t
the
river
as
it
existed
in
an
annual
high
flow
stage.
for
perhaps
familiar
already,
the
colorado
river
is
a
river
that
traditionally
before
the
days
of
boulder
dam
drained
the
water
shed
of
the
colorado
and
when
it
did,
it
ran
in
the
late
spring
and
the
early
summer
months.
so
the
only
period
of
time
that
that
river
really
had
a
high
flow
stage
was
during
that
particular
part
of
the
year.
any
other
time
it
was
rather
a
docile
river
and
sometimes
had
very
low
water
in
it
and
all
of
the
surveys
that
i
know
anything
about
were
done
at
the
time
the
river
was
low.
and
so
you
see
on
exhibit
k
that’s
on
page
five
of
respondent’s
brief,
an
approximate
location
of
that
low
flow
but
you
see
also
to
the
right
of
the
subject
land
a
500-foot
to
550-foot
contour.
and
for
showing
it
on
this
big
map,
the
550-foot
contour
is
clear
off
in
this
area.
the
subject
land
is
the
red
and
it
is
way
over
here.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that’s
the
dotted
line.
the
next
exhibit
that
i
inserted
in
the
respondent’s
brief
is
at
page
six.
this
is
a
copy
of
the
general
land
survey
of
1906
which
for
all
intensive
purposes
was
the
statehood
survey
for
arizona
and
at
that
time,
the
colorado
river
had
moved
to
a
point
where
it
had
nearly
gone
into
the
southwest
corner
of
the
subject
land.
now,
this
was
1906
and
in
relation
to
mr.
justice
white’s
argument
about
whether
it
was
riparian
or
not,
i
would
just
say
that
this
is
the
closest
date
we
have
to
determine
whether
it
was
a
riparian
land.
now
the
strict
doctrine
of
riparianship
says
that
land
must
be
bordering
a
navigable
stream.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
and
this
is
not
at
the
closest
survey
we
had.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
it’s
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
i
would
have
to
say
i
do
not
know
and
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
in
complete
candid,
i
have
to
say
we
did
everything
possible
to
determine
where
this
river
was
at
a
particular
time.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
1912.
now
there
are
two
questions
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
perhaps
this
is
a
good
time
to
make
a
statement
of
this
particular
problem.
i
represented
the
state
of
arizona
in
a
case
called
claridge
versus
the
united
states.
the
supreme
court
denied
certainly
that
a
few
years
ago.
that
case
arose
in
the
early
blithe,
california
and
if
you’re
familiar
with
blithe,
the
river
in
that
area
is
--
the
river
valley
is
approximately
15
to
20
miles
wide.
there
is
no
doubt
that
that
river
has
run
over
all
of
that
area
at
some
time.
some
time
prehistoric,
the
river
was
completely
across
that
valley
just
as
it
was
across
this
complete
area
here.
in
the
claridge
decision,
the
state
of
arizona
took
the
position
that
the
river
bed
that
the
state
of
arizona
took
title
to
at
statehood
was
that
total
area
wherever
the
river
completely
took
the
land
during
that
high
flow
stage.
now
the
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
yes,
at
any
time
in
history
and
particular
at
anytime
subsequent
to
the
united
states
being
there.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
it’s
a
big
irrigation
ditch
and
so
our
position
was
this
in
claridge
that
we
own
a
much
larger
area
and
that
then
begs
the
question
of
whether
the
united
states
could
convey
away
pieces
of
land
like
this
and
thousands
of
other
partials
up
and
down
the
river.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
before
statehood.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
well
they
could
not
because
under
the
pollard
decision
they
would
have
reserved
that
land
for
the
states
to
be
created.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
the
claridge
card
held
that
no
--
the
river
was
not
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
yes,
they
said
that
no,
you
do
not
go
out
that
far
to
this
if
you
place
550-foot
contour
on
exhibit
k.
you
go
where
the
river
is
today,
that
is
basically
what
claridge
held.
you
go
where
it
is
today
which
will
then
reduce
us
to
a
narrow
configuration
and
so
even
if
we’re
reduced
to
that
configuration
i
think
we
question
whether
bonelli
was
riparian.
there
is
no
proof
that
he
was.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
no.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
and
i’ll
tell
you
right
now
why.
i
don’t
think
he’s
right
even
then
because
the
state
of
arizona
owns
the
bed
of
a
navigable
stream
wherever
it
is.
and
what
we
have
in
this
case,
is
the
river
moving
from
its
position
in
1903
until
1906
when
it
was
still
apparently
not
on
the
land.
then
we
have
the
next
location
and
i
put
that
at
page
nine
on
my
brief,
which
is
the
1960
revision
of
a
topographic
map
filed
by
the
officer
of
river
control
of
the
bureau
of
reclamation.
and
at
that
time,
as
you
can
see
from
that
exhibit,
the
river
had
inundated
almost
the
entire
track
of
land
and
that
is
the
last
natural,
if
we
disregard
boulder
dam
in
its
effect,
this
is
the
last
natural
as
natural
as
that
can
be.
now,
i
think
we
have
to
start
from
that
particular
point.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
it’s
actually
a
1950
seven-and-a-half
minute
quadrangle
sheet
published
by
the
geologic
survey.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
was
this
particular
map
that
is
exhibit
e1
and
the
letter
that
is
attached
to
it
in
the
agreed
statement
of
facts
says
that
it
obtained
in
1952.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
‘52
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
and
was
updated
for
the
sake
of
re-channelization
to
1960.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
and
so
immediately
before
the
united
states
went
in
to
re-channelize
that,
this
is
the
configuration
of
the
“natural
river”.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that
is
substantially
correct.
i
would
call
you
attention
to
page
12
of
the
respondent’s
brief
which
is
actually
a
resurvey
of
the
same
thing.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that’s
correct,
when
the
river
have
been
over
to
the
west,
we
have
lost
that,
we
have
transferred
ownership
of
the
riverbed
to
the
now
existing
stream
and
while
i
called
your
attention
to
page
12,
that’s
dependent
resurvey
by
the
bureau
of
land
management
that
is
actually
the
survey
agency
and
they
locate
the
old
left
bank
of
the
colorado
river
before
re-channelization.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
yes,
yes
a
dependent
resurvey
and
they
have
located
a
little
bit
further
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
i
do
not
believe
it’s
dependent.
i
think
it’s
a
resurvey.
if
i
am
correct,
i’ll
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
it’s
a
resurvey.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
it’s
a
resurvey.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
what
it
does
is
it
reduces
the
amount
of
land
that’s
left
outside
the
river
slightly
and
so
it’s
our
positions
from
those
three
or
those
particular
exhibits
that
we’ve
got
nothing
more
than
an
accretive
movement
of
the
river
and
you
secure
that
agreement
from
counsel
for
the
petitioner
that
he
agrees
that
there
has
been
an
accretion.
that
accretion
moved
the
bed
of
the
river
over
until
it
completely,
except
for
the
60
acres
in
the
southwest
or
the
southeast
corner,
inundated
the
subject
land
and
at
that
particular
moment,
the
state
of
arizona
and
nevada
owned
the
bed
of
the
colorado
river
even
though
it
was
on
his
land
and
there
had
been
no
taking
by
anyone
except
the
actions
of
the
river.
the
land
was
at
the
mercy
of
the
river.
sometimes
i
don’t
think
the
doctrine
of
accretion
is
as
sound
as
it
ought
to
be
but
it
is
the
doctrine
that
is
pretty
well
substantiated
by
all
law
in
this
country.
and
that
doctrine
of
accretion
includes
not
only
the
affect
upon
private
lands
as
one
of
the
justices
asked
but
it
also
carries
with
it
the
ownership
of
the
bed
of
the
stream.
its
effect
is
upon
the
riparian
land,
its
effect
is
likewise
upon
the
bed
of
the
stream
which
is
owned
by
the
states.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
reliction,
of
course
reliction
is
the
withdrawal
of
water
and
i
would
have
to
say
reliction
is
a
doctrine
which
is
similar
to
accretion
and
the
law
is
the
same
in
that
sort
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
well,
definitely
mr.
justice,
i
would
agree
so.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
very
correct.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
well
not
so,
i
do
not
believe
well
and
then
we
get
into
the
question
of
the
man-made
effect.
there’s
a
bunch
of
cases
in
the
body
of
law
which
says
if
accretion
or
reliction
was
caused
by
some
upstream
effect
and
it
was
not
designed
for
this
particular
purpose
then
it
is
not
the
same
or
it
is
the
same,
excuse
me.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
in
this
particular
case
we’re
not
talking
about
that,
we’re
talking
about
a
specific
act
which
came
in
to
reduce
the
flow,
to
constrict
the
river.
that
was
the
purpose
of
re-channelization.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that
is
for
all
the
law
that
i
can
find
on
it
that
it
tantamount
to
an
evulsion.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
yes
sir.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
this
is
substantially
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
and
the
only
thing
that
i
think
remains
that
i
want
to
emphasize
is
this,
i
think
there
are
two
real
questions
in
this.
and
the
first
one
involves
the
location
of
the
ordinary
high
water
mark
with
reference
to
boulder
dam
and
its
effect.
i’m
deeply
convinced
that
boulder
dam
took
a
great
body
of
land
out
of
the
state’s
ownership
by
reducing
the
stream
bed.
and
i
urge
that
in
the
other
court
and
they
did
never
get
the
chance
to
get
to
this
court
whether
i
think
it’s
a
matter
that
ought
to
be
considered.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
the
reliction,
an
ordinary
reliction,
mr.
justice
white.
it
would’ve
been
a
reliction
because
they
reduced
the
water
and
the
only
problem
with
that
decision
is
that
it
would
be
very
effective
adversely
economically
on
a
tremendous
quantity
of
land.
it
would
be
a
very
harsh
thing
and
i
think
the
law
supports
it
but
i
have
a
hard
time
following
it
all
the
way
in
today’s
modern
times
in
40
years
since
boulder
dam.
the
other
thing
that
i
think
this
decision
needs
is
a
real
determination
as
to
the
effect
of
that
question
is.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that
question
--
yes
it
is,
mr.
justice
brennan.
it
came
into
the
case
through
justice
struckmeyer
there
on
the
supreme
court.
we
didn’t
assert
it
because
we
felt
claridge
had
pretty
well
decided
the
issue
and
when
this
court
denied
we
did
not
assert
that.
but
mr.
justice
struckmeyer
brought
it
back
in,
said
that
is
the
law
and
the
boundary
up
to
be
somewhere
out
here.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
well
in
that
event
the
state
of
arizona
and
the
states
of
california
respectively
nevada
could
own
an
awful
lot
more
of
land
that’s
along
the
boarder
of
this
stream.
now
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that’s
very
much
correct.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
it’s
a
boundary
now,
mr.
justice
white
that
has
been
established
in
the
center
of
the
re-channelization.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
yes,
by
compact
between
the
states
that
has
been
approved
by
congress.
that’s
shown
clearly
at
page
12.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
and
that
is
the
boundary
now
between
the
states.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
very
definitely
and
i
do
not
dispute
that.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
well,
it
is
in
the
fact
that
there
are
large
bodies
of
land
that
are
still
litigated
between
the
united
states.
that
is
what
claridge
was
and
there’s
substantially
other
records
like
it.
there’s
also
an
important
point
before
my
time
runs
out,
i
ought
to
mention
this.
in
the
re-channelization
process
of
the
colorado
river
in
many
places,
the
river
has
been
moved
subsequent
to
the
determination
of
statehood
boundary
and
for
example
i
might
say
that
we’ve
taken
this
river
and
physically
moved
it
over
here
and
re-channelized
it
and
there
remains
a
bed
that
was
abandoned.
and
i
think
there
are
13
such
instances
from
this
point
down
to
yuma.
arizona
and
california
have
wondered
for
a
long
time
what
to
do
about
this.
in
other
words
there
is
land
in
arizona
that
belongs
to
california
and
land
in
california
that
belongs
to
arizona
which
is
prior
beds
of
the
river
and
we
are
there
now
in
the
process
of
trying
to
get
together
and
perhaps
workout
some
trades
which
are
specifically
allowed
under
the
boundary
compact.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that
does
not
affect
the
boundaries.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
no.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that
is
correct
and
the
boundary
compacts
specifically
says
it
does
not
affect
title
to
land.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
the
boundary
would
have
continued
to
change,
that
was
the
real
problem.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that’s
probably
correct.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
mr.
coker
referred
to
one
case
which
the
earliest
case
in
arizona
that
dealt
with
the
accretion
doctrine
was
the
jacobs
case
which
is
cited
in
all
our
briefs
and
it
happened
to
be
a
rape
case
and
the
involvement
where
the
accretion
and
evulsion
doctrine
had
to
do
with
boundary.
and
that
was
the
first
time
my
court
ever
spoke
upon
the
doctrine
of
accretion
evulsion.
very
strange
form
to
get
to
that
subject.
but
since
then
they
have
had
two
or
three
other
cases
which
have
adopted
the
doctrine.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
there
are
no
cases
mr.
justice
white
i
know
of.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
i
don’t
believe
there
are
any
cases
which
say
accretion
and
evulsion
apply
only
to
private
people.
it
applies
to
all
those
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
yes,
it
applies
in
all
essence
of
before
you
are
dealing
with
a
navigable
stream.
but
there’s
no
distinguishing.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
yes,
i
think
the
oklahoma
versus
texas
case
and
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
in
which
private
parties?
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
well,
i’m
just
saying
that
there
are
other
lands
up
and
down
that
river,
i
don’t
say
that
there
are
parties
to
it.
those
are
not
here.
they’re
not
here,
the
only
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
bonelli
cattleand
this
is
what
the
case
is
about.
the
only
effect
i
see
on
it
is
that
there
are
numerous
other
similar
acres
of
land
that
are
situated
in
the
identical
situation
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
well,
i
would
hope
so.
we
spent
about
15
years
in
arizona
trying
to
make
some
law
which
would
guide
us
in
these
areas
and
that’s
why
we
are
here.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that
is
correct.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that
is
correct.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
they
uncovered
the
state
of
arizona’s
land,
bonelli
had
resisted.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
the
facts
are
that
it
had
--
the
river
had
acquired
the
land
and
that
became
the
bed
of
the
stream
the
state
owned
and
at
that
moment
bonelli
did
not
own
it.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
he
didn’t
own
anything
and
he
did
not
get
it
back
by
the
action
of
the
united
states,
that
is
not
submergence
and
reappearances
has
been
suggested.
it’s
not
reliction;
it’s
merely
an
evulsion
that
speeded
up
the
process
of
changing
the
channel
of
a
river.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that
is.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
no,
because
all
the
parties
have
agreed
that
it
is
an
evulsion.
in
fact,
the
brief
of
the
petitioner
specifically
agrees
to
that.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
i
would
agree
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
all
of
the
--
the
only
two
i
can
think
of
is
one
that
is
called
california
case
and
it
is
cited
in
the
brief,
and
i
have
to
dig
it
out
and
a
marine
railway
case
which
his
the
patomic
river
case
and
it’s
also
cited
both
the
united
states
in
our
--
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
well,
this
one
is
the
patomic
and
it
was
in
the
area
of
building
out
from
the
boundary
of
maryland
and
it’s
not
specifically
on
bed
stream.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
the
reason
we
didn’t
and
you
notice
we
joined
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
and
the
reason
we
joined
in
it
and
brought
it
up
here
to
try
to
see
if
we
can
secure
a
stamp
on
this
ordinary
high
water
mark
law
is
because
we
are
concerned
with
where
is
it.
what
are
we
to
do
in
arizona
with
relation
to
other
lands,
which
maybe
federal
is
claridge
binding
on
us.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
if
it
was
not
riparian,
mr.
justice
white,
you’re
probably
correct
and
we
shouldn’t
even
be
here
but
we
feel
that
there
is
enough
doubt
that
it
is
and
i
would
admit
for
the
sake
of
getting
the
decision
that
it
maybe
is,
was
riparian
in
that
particular
time
and
it
still
does
not
make
any
difference
because
of
the
doctrine
of
riverbed
ownership.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
exactly,
very
much.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
completely.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
that’s
correct.
mr.
dale
r.
shumway
and
basically
i
think
hughes
announced
as
a
federal
law
which
is
probably
the
same
as
the
common
law
of
arizona
and
the
case
law
under
two
or
three
decisions
which
have
remotely
considered
the
question.
although
there
are
some
other
questions
that
have
been
discussed
basically
the
one
on
estoppel.
i
feel
i
should
just
mention
it
that
i
do
not
believe
there’s
much
there
that
indicate
that
the
state
of
arizona
has
done
anything
which
brings
it
within
the
requirement
of
an
estoppel
position.
i
don’t
believe
we
have
any
problems
there
and
i’ve
suggested
so
in
the
brief.
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
arizona
supreme
court,
if
we
are
considering
the
land
was
riparian
and
bringing
the
federal
question
into
bare
should
be
affirmed
and
that
the
land
should
belong
to
the
state
of
arizona.
thank
you.
