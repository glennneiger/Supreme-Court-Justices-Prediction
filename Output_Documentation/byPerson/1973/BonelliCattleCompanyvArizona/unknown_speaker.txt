unknown
speaker
do
you
have
a
copy
of
that?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
mean
did
you
have
that
with
submitted
papers
and
the
facts
have
reached
us
this
morning?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
what
comes
to
print
out
on
exhibit
k.
unknown
speaker
that’s
right
over
here.
was
it
1902?
unknown
speaker
and
where
is
the
river?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
think
it’s
perfectly
clear
and
accepted
in
this
case
that
the
land
in
dispute
was
not
riparian
land
in
1902?
unknown
speaker
and
when
was
the
patent
done?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
where
the
land
was
in
1910?
unknown
speaker
not
as
of
1910.
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
the
river?
unknown
speaker
in
when?3.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
think
when
the
patent
was
issued
the
land
was
riparian
land?
unknown
speaker
would
you
think
it
is
a
vital
question?
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
finding
on
it
below?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
take
in
position?
unknown
speaker
so
you
--
but
there
was
no
finding
on
it?
unknown
speaker
does
your
opponent
below
ask
that?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
that?
unknown
speaker
is
that
exhibit
b?
unknown
speaker
c?
unknown
speaker
d?
unknown
speaker
do
you
adhere
that
the
united
states
engineers
make
the
most
recent
improvement
that
channelize
--
unknown
speaker
and
there
has
been
no
flooding
since
then?
unknown
speaker
i
assume
you’re
going
to
tell
us
what
the
issue
is
in
this
case
and
what
it
is
about.
unknown
speaker
for
that
preliminary
information.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
dispute
between
you
and
your
friends
on
the
other
side
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
an
evulsive
change,
whether
or
not
a
man
made
sudden
change
as
evulsive?
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
i
understood
from
reading
the
briefs.
unknown
speaker
mr.
coker.
unknown
speaker
in
that
connection,
do
you
consider
that
the
changes
with
respect
to
this
property
between
1906,
1938
and
1959
were
accretive
or
evulsive?
this
was
after
the
hoover
dam
but
before
the
dredging
out
of
the
channel.
unknown
speaker
which
is
your
position
for
that
year
or
term
period
from
the
date
of
the
hoover
dam
until
the
dredging
of
the
new
channel?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
accretive
i
think,
you
think
that
--
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
coker,
do
you
have
any
thoughts
as
to
why
the
1953
act,
the
submerged
lands
act
was
necessary?
unknown
speaker
yes.
so
far
as
your
claims
are
concerned.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
practical
result
of
the
arizona
decision
on
bonelli’s
title?
did
it
completely
destroy
it?
unknown
speaker
as
i
read
the
solicitor
general’s
brief,
he
makes
a
plot
statement
that
changes
caused
by
channelization
are
evulsive
in
nature.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
authority
for
that
statement?
unknown
speaker
and
your
way
out
of
that
is
what
--
i
mean,
if
it
were
an
evulsive
and
title
did
not
change
you
would
think
the
state
still
own
the
bed
of
the
river.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
what
the
court
held?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
an
evulsive
change
without
a
changed
title?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
would
say,
you’d
come
into
the
same
--
you
would
make
the
same
argument
if
man
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
change
of
this
river?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
would
really
overrule
some
of
the
substantial
body
of
law,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
grant
at
the
final
statement?
unknown
speaker
your
basic
claim
against
is,
is
or
tell
if
i
am
wrong
is
that,
what
the
state
owns
is
the
bed
of
the
streams
under
the
high
water
mark
whereas
the
stream
might
be
at
any
given
time.
unknown
speaker
period?
unknown
speaker
and
that
by
virtue
is
the
grant?
unknown
speaker
there’s
no
question
that
the
state
would
own
the
land
under
the
river
wherever
it
is.
unknown
speaker
and
the
question
is
whether
they’re
doing
something
else.
unknown
speaker
actually
in
that
period.
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
say
that
the
case
is
about
evulsions
are
really
are
only
applicable
between
private
parties
rather
than
--
unknown
speaker
rather
than
dealing.
unknown
speaker
or
applicable
in
determining
the
boundary
between
two
states.
unknown
speaker
but
not
between
the
state
and
a
private
party
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
what
relevance
if
any,
do
you
think
the
case
of
hughes
against
washington
has?
unknown
speaker
and
you
agree
that
it
does.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there’s
any
ground
after
the
hughes
case
to
say
that
the
state
law
governs?
unknown
speaker
you
may
remember
i
had
a
different
view
point
in
that
case
in
concurring.
unknown
speaker
well
that
was--
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
view
of
the
concurring
opinion
on
the
hughes
case.
unknown
speaker
the
relevance
of
the
hughes
case
depends
on
whether
it
was
riparian
at
the
time
of
the
patent
and
you
say
it
was
--
unknown
speaker
can
you
just
tell
me
on
that
map
there
--
describe
or
just
outline
the
--
what
was
the
limits
of
the
bonelli
grant
in
terms
of
the
sections
and
quarter
sections.
where
did
that
lie
on
that
map?
unknown
speaker
well
this
--
no,
never
mind
then.
unknown
speaker
if
you
just
took
the
descriptions
on
the
sections
and
the
quarter
sections
just
the
way
that
patent
was
described
and
located
it
on
the
ground,
would
it
cover
all
of
the
land
that’s
now
in
dispute
or
do
you
have
--
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
but
would
it
cover
all
the
land
that
is
now
in
dispute?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
that
is
page
five
of
--
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
that’s
the
dotted
line?
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
not
on
the
--
unknown
speaker
but
the
closest
point,
how
distant
is
it?
unknown
speaker
a
quarter
of
a
mile.
unknown
speaker
the
other
hand
at
the
rate
which
--
at
the
rate
that
at
which
it
was
moving
between
1902
and
1906,
it
would
have
been
made
the
land
riparian
by
1910,
wouldn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
if
one
assumes
that
steady
rate
of
movement
to
the
east.
unknown
speaker
and
what’s
the
year
of
statehood?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
claim
that
the
river
bottom
--
that
the
river
covered
this
land
completely
or
that
this
land
should
be
considered
as
part
of
the
river
bed
in
1906
or
1910?
unknown
speaker
at
any
time
in
history.
was
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
was
your
position?
was
that
in
history
or
pre
history?
our
position
in
that
case,
we
said
this,
it’s
most
difficult
for
us
to
go
bluff
to
bluff
because
that
encompasses
thousands
of
acres
of
land
which
is
already
utilized
by
private
owners.
but
we
said
this
is
the
section
area
of
land
that
we
ought
to
cover.
we
ought
to
cover
the
area
where
the
river
had
run
in
times
that
we
could
remember.
in
particular
of
that
case,
in
blithe
area,
the
claridge
decision,
it
was
very
clear
and
we
proved
it
by
witnesses
that
the
river
have
been
about
two-and-a-half
miles
wide
as
late
as
1913-14,
even
up
in
1920.
now
after
boulder
dam
you
see,
this
river
has
never
been
a
natural
river
anymore.
it’s
merely
a
conduit
that
conveys
water
from
boulder
dam
down
to
the
irrigation
projects
and
to
the
los
angeles
area
etcetera.
and
so
the
river
today
is
not
a
natural
river
and
it
hasn’t
been
for
a
long,
long
time.
unknown
speaker
it’s
just
a
big
irrigation
ditch.
unknown
speaker
before
statehood.
unknown
speaker
if
you
were
right,
they
could
not.
unknown
speaker
and
then
what
did
the
claridge
card
hold?
unknown
speaker
that’s
court
of
appeals
on
the
ninth
circuit,
right?
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
was
--
if
he
was
then
he’s
right
then
this
case
under
claridge,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
no.
why
not?
unknown
speaker
your
position
is
that
since
1906
or
whenever
that
last
map
was,
that
the
river
moved
enough
that
the
state
of
arizona
had
picked
up
everything
within
this
near
underlines,
these
high
water
mark
lines
on
exhibit
e1.
unknown
speaker
but
then
by
the
same
token,
arizona
had
lost
title
to
all
of
the
other
land
that
the
river
used
to
cover.
unknown
speaker
you
said
a
dependent
resurvey?
unknown
speaker
they
prefer
to
pick
up
the
old
markers.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
its
then
you
have
a
real
problem
knowing
where
the
land
is
on
the
ground
anyway.
unknown
speaker
when
land
is
concerned.
unknown
speaker
in
1962.
unknown
speaker
but
then
you
--
that
includes
reliction,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
after
exhibit
e1
was
prepared,
deliver
itself
that
propel
that
channel.
if
nature
did
that,
you
would
agree
that
bonelli
be
covered
title
to
this
land?
unknown
speaker
if
that
has
been
a
natural
relictive
movement.
unknown
speaker
or
a
man-made
relictive
movement?
unknown
speaker
it
is
the
same.
unknown
speaker
right
and
it
is
agreed
that
while
man-made
was
evulsion,
correct?
unknown
speaker
i
think
your
brother
conceded
that.
unknown
speaker
and
your
claim
therefore
basically
is
that
the
accretive
movement
to
the
east
and
southeast
under
accepted
principles
of
law
in
this
area
gave
title
to
the
state
to
that
part
of
that
land
that
was
under
the
high
water
mark
of
the
river
when
it
was
over
there
in
the
southeast
and
that
title
remained
in
the
state
after
the
evulsive
movement
to
the
west
and
northwest
created
by
the
channelization
of
the
river.
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
argument,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
what
question
here?
unknown
speaker
but
in
which
event
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
does
not
affect
the
boundaries.
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
the
ownership
of
land.
unknown
speaker
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
if
there
had
not
been
a
compact,
the
boundary
would
not
have
changed
though.
unknown
speaker
yes
but
not
if
you
deliberately
re-channelize
the
river
somewhere.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
certainly,
it
applies
between
states
and
--
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
the
bed
of
the
stream
and
that’s
its
context.
unknown
speaker
but
why
is
it
do
you
think
we
have
to
reach
that
question
in
this
case,
i
gather
this
private
land
owners
would
not
be
affected
by
it
and
you
suggest
adversely
very
seriously.
there
have
not
been
parties
to
any
proceedings
that
involve
this
plain
state,
are
they
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
not
know,
you
said
there
was,
earlier
--
unknown
speaker
the
bonelli
cattle
company
is
here
and
that’s
a
private
land
owner.
unknown
speaker
if
the
state
prevails
here,
that
necessarily
is
going
to
have
a
bearing
on
these
other
lands.
unknown
speaker
for
years
arizona
has
acquired
title
to
the
riverbed
by
an
accretive
change
in
the
location
of
the
river
and
you
acquired
title
to
the
major
share
of
bonelli’s
land.
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
river
had
kept
moving,
in
the
same
way
then
the
bonelli
land
relicted
that
would’ve
acquired
title
to
it,
wouldn’t
they?
unknown
speaker
and
here
you
say
because
the
united
states
came
in
and
uncovered
bonelli’s
land
by
a
channelization,
the
state
nevertheless
retains
title.
unknown
speaker
which
it
had
acquired?
which
it
had
acquired
from
bonelli.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
the
real
issue
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
whether
there
is
or
not
an
evulsion.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
then
the
usual
results
follow
from
an
evulsive
change,
your
opponent
is
giving
away
this
case
by
making
that
agreement.
unknown
speaker
well,
except
you
agreed
that
there
are
no
cases
applying
the
evulsion
doctrine
between
the
state
and
an
individual
in
these
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
does
both
of
the
cases
involve
the
bed
of
the
stream?
unknown
speaker
not
the
doctrine,
not
the
bed
of
the
stream
doctrine.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
one
more
question,
why
isn’t
the
--
i’m
sure
you
would
say
it
is
but
why
isn’t
the
--
what’s
the
argument
that
the
arizona
supreme
court’s
decision
is
not
binding
on
us?
because
this
is
a
wholly
a
matter
of
state
law,
what’s
the
argument
that
federal
law
has
anything
to
do
with
this?
well
i
am
not
so
sure
it
does,
the
only
question
that
the
--
the
only
reason
that
we
joined
is
--
i
don’t
think
you
would
argue
that
at
the
first,
as
a
sectional
question.
unknown
speaker
federal
law
would
be
applicable
only
by
reason
of
the
hughes
decision
holding
that
the
by
reason
of
a
federal
patent,
federal
law
applied
to
riparian
land
but
only
to
riparian
land.
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
was
not
even
unanimous
about
that.
unknown
speaker
patent
--
unknown
speaker
from
the
united
states
to
santa
fe?
unknown
speaker
when
was
the
township
plot?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
know
that
is
it
but
bonelli
section
three
--
unknown
speaker
a
part
of
section
three
was
that
bonelli
did
not
take
all
the
section
three.
unknown
speaker
and
so
that
the
bonelli
land
in
1906
by
any
map
was
not
on
the
river?
unknown
speaker
do
you
understand
your
arizona
supreme
court
who
have
been
applying
state
law
to
the
exclusion
of
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
--
what
is
this
grant?
you
see
about
the
question
about
evulsion
and
accretion.
what
is
the
grant?
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
grant?
when
that
purpose
no
longer
remains,
does
the
grant
remain?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
a
copy
of
that?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
mean
did
you
have
that
with
submitted
papers
and
the
facts
have
reached
us
this
morning?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
what
comes
to
print
out
on
exhibit
k.
unknown
speaker
that’s
right
over
here.
was
it
1902?
unknown
speaker
and
where
is
the
river?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
think
it’s
perfectly
clear
and
accepted
in
this
case
that
the
land
in
dispute
was
not
riparian
land
in
1902?
unknown
speaker
and
when
was
the
patent
done?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
where
the
land
was
in
1910?
unknown
speaker
not
as
of
1910.
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
the
river?
unknown
speaker
in
when?3.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
think
when
the
patent
was
issued
the
land
was
riparian
land?
unknown
speaker
would
you
think
it
is
a
vital
question?
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
finding
on
it
below?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
take
in
position?
unknown
speaker
so
you
--
but
there
was
no
finding
on
it?
unknown
speaker
does
your
opponent
below
ask
that?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
that?
unknown
speaker
is
that
exhibit
b?
unknown
speaker
c?
unknown
speaker
d?
unknown
speaker
do
you
adhere
that
the
united
states
engineers
make
the
most
recent
improvement
that
channelize
--
unknown
speaker
and
there
has
been
no
flooding
since
then?
unknown
speaker
i
assume
you’re
going
to
tell
us
what
the
issue
is
in
this
case
and
what
it
is
about.
unknown
speaker
for
that
preliminary
information.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
dispute
between
you
and
your
friends
on
the
other
side
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
an
evulsive
change,
whether
or
not
a
man
made
sudden
change
as
evulsive?
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
i
understood
from
reading
the
briefs.
unknown
speaker
mr.
coker.
unknown
speaker
in
that
connection,
do
you
consider
that
the
changes
with
respect
to
this
property
between
1906,
1938
and
1959
were
accretive
or
evulsive?
this
was
after
the
hoover
dam
but
before
the
dredging
out
of
the
channel.
unknown
speaker
which
is
your
position
for
that
year
or
term
period
from
the
date
of
the
hoover
dam
until
the
dredging
of
the
new
channel?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
accretive
i
think,
you
think
that
--
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
coker,
do
you
have
any
thoughts
as
to
why
the
1953
act,
the
submerged
lands
act
was
necessary?
unknown
speaker
yes.
so
far
as
your
claims
are
concerned.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
practical
result
of
the
arizona
decision
on
bonelli’s
title?
did
it
completely
destroy
it?
unknown
speaker
as
i
read
the
solicitor
general’s
brief,
he
makes
a
plot
statement
that
changes
caused
by
channelization
are
evulsive
in
nature.
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
authority
for
that
statement?
unknown
speaker
and
your
way
out
of
that
is
what
--
i
mean,
if
it
were
an
evulsive
and
title
did
not
change
you
would
think
the
state
still
own
the
bed
of
the
river.
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
what
the
court
held?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
an
evulsive
change
without
a
changed
title?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
would
say,
you’d
come
into
the
same
--
you
would
make
the
same
argument
if
man
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
change
of
this
river?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
would
really
overrule
some
of
the
substantial
body
of
law,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
grant
at
the
final
statement?
unknown
speaker
your
basic
claim
against
is,
is
or
tell
if
i
am
wrong
is
that,
what
the
state
owns
is
the
bed
of
the
streams
under
the
high
water
mark
whereas
the
stream
might
be
at
any
given
time.
unknown
speaker
period?
unknown
speaker
and
that
by
virtue
is
the
grant?
unknown
speaker
there’s
no
question
that
the
state
would
own
the
land
under
the
river
wherever
it
is.
unknown
speaker
and
the
question
is
whether
they’re
doing
something
else.
unknown
speaker
actually
in
that
period.
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
say
that
the
case
is
about
evulsions
are
really
are
only
applicable
between
private
parties
rather
than
--
unknown
speaker
rather
than
dealing.
unknown
speaker
or
applicable
in
determining
the
boundary
between
two
states.
unknown
speaker
but
not
between
the
state
and
a
private
party
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
what
relevance
if
any,
do
you
think
the
case
of
hughes
against
washington
has?
unknown
speaker
and
you
agree
that
it
does.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there’s
any
ground
after
the
hughes
case
to
say
that
the
state
law
governs?
unknown
speaker
you
may
remember
i
had
a
different
view
point
in
that
case
in
concurring.
unknown
speaker
well
that
was--
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
view
of
the
concurring
opinion
on
the
hughes
case.
unknown
speaker
the
relevance
of
the
hughes
case
depends
on
whether
it
was
riparian
at
the
time
of
the
patent
and
you
say
it
was
--
unknown
speaker
can
you
just
tell
me
on
that
map
there
--
describe
or
just
outline
the
--
what
was
the
limits
of
the
bonelli
grant
in
terms
of
the
sections
and
quarter
sections.
where
did
that
lie
on
that
map?
unknown
speaker
well
this
--
no,
never
mind
then.
unknown
speaker
if
you
just
took
the
descriptions
on
the
sections
and
the
quarter
sections
just
the
way
that
patent
was
described
and
located
it
on
the
ground,
would
it
cover
all
of
the
land
that’s
now
in
dispute
or
do
you
have
--
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
but
would
it
cover
all
the
land
that
is
now
in
dispute?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
that
is
page
five
of
--
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
that’s
the
dotted
line?
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
not
on
the
--
unknown
speaker
but
the
closest
point,
how
distant
is
it?
unknown
speaker
a
quarter
of
a
mile.
unknown
speaker
the
other
hand
at
the
rate
which
--
at
the
rate
that
at
which
it
was
moving
between
1902
and
1906,
it
would
have
been
made
the
land
riparian
by
1910,
wouldn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
if
one
assumes
that
steady
rate
of
movement
to
the
east.
unknown
speaker
and
what’s
the
year
of
statehood?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
claim
that
the
river
bottom
--
that
the
river
covered
this
land
completely
or
that
this
land
should
be
considered
as
part
of
the
river
bed
in
1906
or
1910?
unknown
speaker
at
any
time
in
history.
was
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
was
your
position?
was
that
in
history
or
pre
history?
our
position
in
that
case,
we
said
this,
it’s
most
difficult
for
us
to
go
bluff
to
bluff
because
that
encompasses
thousands
of
acres
of
land
which
is
already
utilized
by
private
owners.
but
we
said
this
is
the
section
area
of
land
that
we
ought
to
cover.
we
ought
to
cover
the
area
where
the
river
had
run
in
times
that
we
could
remember.
in
particular
of
that
case,
in
blithe
area,
the
claridge
decision,
it
was
very
clear
and
we
proved
it
by
witnesses
that
the
river
have
been
about
two-and-a-half
miles
wide
as
late
as
1913-14,
even
up
in
1920.
now
after
boulder
dam
you
see,
this
river
has
never
been
a
natural
river
anymore.
it’s
merely
a
conduit
that
conveys
water
from
boulder
dam
down
to
the
irrigation
projects
and
to
the
los
angeles
area
etcetera.
and
so
the
river
today
is
not
a
natural
river
and
it
hasn’t
been
for
a
long,
long
time.
unknown
speaker
it’s
just
a
big
irrigation
ditch.
unknown
speaker
before
statehood.
unknown
speaker
if
you
were
right,
they
could
not.
unknown
speaker
and
then
what
did
the
claridge
card
hold?
unknown
speaker
that’s
court
of
appeals
on
the
ninth
circuit,
right?
unknown
speaker
but
if
he
was
--
if
he
was
then
he’s
right
then
this
case
under
claridge,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
no.
why
not?
unknown
speaker
your
position
is
that
since
1906
or
whenever
that
last
map
was,
that
the
river
moved
enough
that
the
state
of
arizona
had
picked
up
everything
within
this
near
underlines,
these
high
water
mark
lines
on
exhibit
e1.
unknown
speaker
but
then
by
the
same
token,
arizona
had
lost
title
to
all
of
the
other
land
that
the
river
used
to
cover.
unknown
speaker
you
said
a
dependent
resurvey?
unknown
speaker
they
prefer
to
pick
up
the
old
markers.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
its
then
you
have
a
real
problem
knowing
where
the
land
is
on
the
ground
anyway.
unknown
speaker
when
land
is
concerned.
unknown
speaker
in
1962.
unknown
speaker
but
then
you
--
that
includes
reliction,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
so
that
if
after
exhibit
e1
was
prepared,
deliver
itself
that
propel
that
channel.
if
nature
did
that,
you
would
agree
that
bonelli
be
covered
title
to
this
land?
unknown
speaker
if
that
has
been
a
natural
relictive
movement.
unknown
speaker
or
a
man-made
relictive
movement?
unknown
speaker
it
is
the
same.
unknown
speaker
right
and
it
is
agreed
that
while
man-made
was
evulsion,
correct?
unknown
speaker
i
think
your
brother
conceded
that.
unknown
speaker
and
your
claim
therefore
basically
is
that
the
accretive
movement
to
the
east
and
southeast
under
accepted
principles
of
law
in
this
area
gave
title
to
the
state
to
that
part
of
that
land
that
was
under
the
high
water
mark
of
the
river
when
it
was
over
there
in
the
southeast
and
that
title
remained
in
the
state
after
the
evulsive
movement
to
the
west
and
northwest
created
by
the
channelization
of
the
river.
unknown
speaker
that
is
your
argument,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
what
question
here?
unknown
speaker
but
in
which
event
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
does
not
affect
the
boundaries.
unknown
speaker
it
is
just
the
ownership
of
land.
unknown
speaker
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
if
there
had
not
been
a
compact,
the
boundary
would
not
have
changed
though.
unknown
speaker
yes
but
not
if
you
deliberately
re-channelize
the
river
somewhere.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
certainly,
it
applies
between
states
and
--
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
the
bed
of
the
stream
and
that’s
its
context.
unknown
speaker
but
why
is
it
do
you
think
we
have
to
reach
that
question
in
this
case,
i
gather
this
private
land
owners
would
not
be
affected
by
it
and
you
suggest
adversely
very
seriously.
there
have
not
been
parties
to
any
proceedings
that
involve
this
plain
state,
are
they
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
not
know,
you
said
there
was,
earlier
--
unknown
speaker
the
bonelli
cattle
company
is
here
and
that’s
a
private
land
owner.
unknown
speaker
if
the
state
prevails
here,
that
necessarily
is
going
to
have
a
bearing
on
these
other
lands.
unknown
speaker
for
years
arizona
has
acquired
title
to
the
riverbed
by
an
accretive
change
in
the
location
of
the
river
and
you
acquired
title
to
the
major
share
of
bonelli’s
land.
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
river
had
kept
moving,
in
the
same
way
then
the
bonelli
land
relicted
that
would’ve
acquired
title
to
it,
wouldn’t
they?
unknown
speaker
and
here
you
say
because
the
united
states
came
in
and
uncovered
bonelli’s
land
by
a
channelization,
the
state
nevertheless
retains
title.
unknown
speaker
which
it
had
acquired?
which
it
had
acquired
from
bonelli.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
the
real
issue
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
whether
there
is
or
not
an
evulsion.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
then
the
usual
results
follow
from
an
evulsive
change,
your
opponent
is
giving
away
this
case
by
making
that
agreement.
unknown
speaker
well,
except
you
agreed
that
there
are
no
cases
applying
the
evulsion
doctrine
between
the
state
and
an
individual
in
these
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
does
both
of
the
cases
involve
the
bed
of
the
stream?
unknown
speaker
not
the
doctrine,
not
the
bed
of
the
stream
doctrine.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
one
more
question,
why
isn’t
the
--
i’m
sure
you
would
say
it
is
but
why
isn’t
the
--
what’s
the
argument
that
the
arizona
supreme
court’s
decision
is
not
binding
on
us?
because
this
is
a
wholly
a
matter
of
state
law,
what’s
the
argument
that
federal
law
has
anything
to
do
with
this?
well
i
am
not
so
sure
it
does,
the
only
question
that
the
--
the
only
reason
that
we
joined
is
--
i
don’t
think
you
would
argue
that
at
the
first,
as
a
sectional
question.
unknown
speaker
federal
law
would
be
applicable
only
by
reason
of
the
hughes
decision
holding
that
the
by
reason
of
a
federal
patent,
federal
law
applied
to
riparian
land
but
only
to
riparian
land.
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
was
not
even
unanimous
about
that.
unknown
speaker
patent
--
unknown
speaker
from
the
united
states
to
santa
fe?
unknown
speaker
when
was
the
township
plot?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
know
that
is
it
but
bonelli
section
three
--
unknown
speaker
a
part
of
section
three
was
that
bonelli
did
not
take
all
the
section
three.
unknown
speaker
and
so
that
the
bonelli
land
in
1906
by
any
map
was
not
on
the
river?
unknown
speaker
do
you
understand
your
arizona
supreme
court
who
have
been
applying
state
law
to
the
exclusion
of
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
--
what
is
this
grant?
you
see
about
the
question
about
evulsion
and
accretion.
what
is
the
grant?
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
grant?
when
that
purpose
no
longer
remains,
does
the
grant
remain?
