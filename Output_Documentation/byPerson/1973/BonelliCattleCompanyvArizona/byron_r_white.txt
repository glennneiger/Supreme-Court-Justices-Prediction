you
would’ve
treated
that
as
not
of
an
ordinary
accretive
withdrawal.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the,
is
the
river
here
on
exhibit
e1
at
that
point,
is
it
a
boundary
line
between
two
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
agreement
between
the
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
where
that
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
states
have
--
the
states
by
compact
have
treated
the
hoover
dam,
the
result
of
the
hoover
dam
as
moving
the
boundaries
of
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
so,
the
real
issue
that
is
it
of
still
significance?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
specific
case
showing
that
the
usual
consequences
of
evulsion
operate
in
favor
in
the
state
and
against
the
private
citizen
in
circumstances
like
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
be
here
if
there
was
really
a
clearer
case
also.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
it
seems
to
me,
where
does
the
federal
law
get
a
hold
on
this
sort
of
a
situation.
arguably
if
the
land
was
riparian
at
the
time
of
the
patent,
maybe
the
hughes
case
because
it
gives
it
some
extra
--
it
gives
the
ownership
of
that
land
some
benefits
of
whatever
the
federal
law
is
about
accretion
and
reliction
but
if
it
wasn’t
riparian.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
there
would
be
a
lot
of
other
land
then
that
was
covered
that
this
problem
will
arise,
it
would
not
have
any
connection
with
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
--
if
both
sides
agreed
that
this
land
was
not
riparian
at
the
time
of
the
patent,
wouldn’t
the
arizona
supreme
court
decision
as
to
what
state
law
was
be
determinative?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
that?
because
the
patent
says
so?
justice
byron

you
would’ve
