mr.
elmer
c.
coker
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
shumway
and
i
are
both
deeply
grateful
to
this
court
for
providing
us
the
opportunity
of
arguing
this
matter,
which
is
of
most
importance
not
only
to
the
state
of
arizona
but
its
citizens.
i
would
like
to
briefly
point
out
on
the
map,
which
is
the
most
recent
official
map
published
by
the
bureau
of
land
management.
the
area
along
colorado
river,
the
area
we
are
talking
about
if
i
may,
is
in
here.
now,
the
other
day
i
received--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
almost
identical
but
on
a
smaller
scale,
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
i
would
like
to
leave
this
in,
if
it
is
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
for
our
practical
purposes,
yes
sir.
from
the
arizona
planning
--
planning
commission
map
is
to
take
off
from
this
as
well
as
maybe
the
as
on
highway
department
map.
now
on
thursday,
i
received
on
the
mail
an
amicus
brief
by
the
cocopah
indians.
unfortunately,
i
could
not
spot
that
until
i,
through
the
good
eyes
of
the
united
states
attorney,
i
obtained
some
solicited
opinion
as
the
location
of
that
cocopah
reservation
in
this
area
here.
now,
exhibit
k,
to
go
get
started
with
the
facts
is
a
topographical
map
made
in
1902
and
1903.
it
shows
the
bonelli
land
in
red
and
the
river,
colorado
river
at
that
time.
i
know
it’s
hard
to
see
from
there
but--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir,
this
are
all
in
our
brief,
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir,
i
have
sent
exhibit
k.
exhibit
k.
there
are
only
--
the
only
two
exhibits
here
that
the
court
did
not
have
and
that’s
the
big
map
and
put
it
on
in
aerial
photo.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
the
bonelli
land
which
we
are
concerned
with
here.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
1902,
1903
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
the
river
is
zoned
about
a
mile
to
the
west.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
1903.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
1910
sir.
as
a
result
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
the
land
was
in
the
same
place.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
we
know
as
of
1906
on
the
plot
of
survey
was
filed
which
is
an
evidence,
that
the
river
was
along
in
here.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
1906.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
we
have
no
way
of
knowing,
your
honor.
we’re
trying
to
find
out
that
is
the
reason
we
had
to
submit
this
all
on
documentary
evidence
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
i
do
think
so.
i
think
at
the
time
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
no
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
i
take
the
position
that
--
we
have
to
take
the
position
that
the
title
passed
by
virtue
of
the
patent
in
1910,
based
upon
the
1906
official
plot
of
survey,
which
shows
that
this
was
riparian
to
the
river.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
no
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
we
do
not
know
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
now
mr.
shumway,
at
the
time
we
--
at
the
time
we
prepared
these
exhibits,
we
are
trying
to
get
everything
we
could
possibly
find
in
the
way
of
maps
or
documentary
evidence
that
would
show
the
location
of
the
river.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
now,
this
map
here
is
exhibit
e1
and
two.
e2
is
a
letter
from
the
regional
director
of
the
bill
of
reclamation;
what’s
in
this
map
an
outlining
of
colorado
river
in
the
area
that
we
are
talking
about,
the
bonelli
land.
after
channelization
and
showing
where
the
mark,
the
high
water
mark
was,
immediate
prior
to
channelization.
it
says
that
your
convenience
leads
the
bank
of
the
arctic
channel,
part
of
the
channelization
has
been
indicated
by
a
red
pencil.
now
this
is
exhibit
d
which
is
a
1960
mosaic,
from
vegas
dam
to
an
area
of
the
south
of
the
bonelli
land
in
which
flows
into
the
fort
mohave
indian
reservation.
now,
bullhead
city
at
that
time
is
shown
here.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
d
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
d,
d.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
and
that
is
in
the
agreed
statement
of
facts,
i
do
not
think,
your
honor
that
we
have
extra
copies
but
i
am
going
to
leave
this
with
the
court.
this
shows
the
bonelli
land
and
it
also
shows
very
clearly
on
this
area
where
the
colorado
river
at
one
time
flowed.
back
into
here,
some
three
miles
east
of
the
present
channel,
down
in
here,
back
over
in
here.
over
into
section
two
and
ten
and
any
of
the
indian
reservation
as
i
have
mentioned
in
the
brief,
very
clearly
shows
that
i
see
as
the
high
water
mark
as
defined
by
our
supreme
court
in
the
bonelli
decision.
this
is
an
aerial
photograph
taken
in
january
of
1972
by
nasa
at
an
altitude
of
65,000
feet.
these
photographs
were
prepared
and
furnished
by
the
arizona
highway
department
from
the
film
that
they
have
of
record.
now,
i
might
state
that
nasa
did
make
flights
of
the
complete
course
of
the
river.
now,
today
we
have
the
outline
of
the
same,
with
high
water
mark
or
at
one
time
we
believe
the
colorado
river
flowed
under
the
arizona
decision
but
between
1960
and
1972,
this
area
has
been
highly
developed
by
subdivisions
and
it’s
very
plainly
shown
here
also
the
increase
in
size
of
bullhead
city.
and
it
is
my
position
and
my
interpretation,
i
believe
mr.
shumway
substantially
believes
that
under
the
arizona
decisions,
this
whole
area
now
belongs
to
the
state
of
arizona
whereas
under
the
claridge
decision
it
will
be
a
small
area
and
here
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
1959
sir,
1960,
that’s
when
they
channel
this
area
in
here.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
no
sir
and
that
linked
up
to
the
point
that
i
want
to
make.
this
channel
--
pardon.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
i
have
only
put
this
out
tonight
for
the
purpose
of
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
preliminary.
the
sole
issue
--
really
the
only
issue
that
we
are
involved
here
is
what
is
the
line
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
on
a
navigable
stream
and
when
the
federal
government
comes
in
through
either
its
core
of
engineers
or
bureau
of
reclamation.
bureau
of
reclamation
in
this
part
and
channelize
the
river
under
the
theory
of
navigation
and
also
primarily
in
this
case,
to
conserve
water
for
irrigation
below.
this
channelization
has
just
commenced
and
it
is
going
to
proceed
in
different
areas.
my
main
concern
is
and
i
think
it
will
affect
all
of
us,
is
what
is
the
extent
--
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
grant
given
to
the
states
by
appellant
later
on
confirmed
as
a
swamp
bed.
does
it
extend
from
this
present
channel,
and
say
clear
over
here
some
three
miles
distance
where
the
river
once
flowed.
this
river,
i’ll
point
it
out
is
a
very
--
was
prior
to
the
hoover
dam,
a
very
violent
river.
sometimes
it
will
flow
over
here
and
sometimes
it
will
flow
over
here
according
to
the
amount
of
sediments
carried
down
and
automatically
would
make
one
channel
and
move.
in
this
particular
area,
the
movement
has
been
steady
from
west
to
east.
one
time
maybe
it
did
go
back
to
the
west.
i
can't
teach
you
that
it
was
ever
the
intent
to
grant
to
the
states
under
the
part
of
decision
in
the
swamp
bed.
the
means
by
which
to
acquire
large
areas
of
land,
the
only
purpose
be
into
that
grant
was
to
protect
the
public
in
access
to
the
navigable
stream
and
not
to
provide
large
areas
such
as
this
where
the
river
once
flowed
and
then
become
exposed.
we
ask
on
the
court
holds
that
the
channelization
actually
caused
an
evulsive
change
and
changed
the
--
and
did
not
change
the
ownership
of
this
land
which
was
exposed
by
the
channelization
in
the
state.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
i
think
we
have
to
agree
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
and
that
is
what
happened
here,
up
in
these
areas
--
some
of
these
areas
in
here,
there
was
no
channelization
because
it
was
already
chanellized.
although
at
one
time,
evidence
on
the
ground
indicates
the
river
was
some
distance
to
the
east
but
filled
up.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
well
of
course
under
the
beaver
case
and
under
the
claridge
case
perhaps
it
could
be
considered
as
the
construction
of
the
boulder
dam
and
the
closing
of
the
gates
could
be
considered
in
some
areas
as
an
evulsive
movement.
i
don’t
think
we
so
treat
it
here.
we
concede
between
the
time
the
gates
were
closed
in
1935
and
the
channelization
left
there
were
figures
in
this
river
still
east
of
the
bonelli
land.
we
have
some
aerials
in
the
file
and
we
should
have
bought
some
of
the
reproduced
but
they
are
with
agreed
to
statement
of
facts.
showing
the
flow
of
the
river
of
that
particular
time,
which
are
more
recent.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
as
to
whether
there
is
accretion
or
--
i'm
afraid
i’d
have
to
say
accretion
because
it
is
slow
and
the
reason
it
was
slow
is
because
there
is
so
much
silt
deposit
between
the
dam
and
these
areas
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
but
the
river
would
move,
and
would
have
--
there’s
quite
a
few
canyons
up
and
above
the
dam
and
there
is
a
large
portion
here
for
instance
that
in
flood
times
it
comes
down
and
carries
large
amounts
of
silt.
it
might
push
the
river
flow
at
the
west
side,
but
generally
speaking
the
river
move
eastward
because
of
your
bluster
in
here.
and
as
it
pile
the
silt
up
it
would
form
a
new
channel
or
a
series
channels
and
so
i
would
have
to
say
that
in
my
opinion
it
was
not
an
evulsive
movement
and
it
wasn’t
something
that
happened
overnight.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
accretive,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
some
places
down
in
the
yuma
area
where
the
large
floods
have
come,
it
was
considered
evulsive.
you
would
see
the
river
at
one
point,
one
day
in
a
pretty
good
size,
the
flood
had
come
down
and
it
had
moved
almost
overnight.
i
think
we
had
a
criminal
case
it
involved
that
move
in
the
arizona
supreme
court.
the
other
point
that
i
feel
is
of
most
important
and
i
raised
that
in
my
reply
brief,
i
raise
it
in
the
opening
brief
and
the
reply
brief
and
that
is
under
our
peculiar
circumstances
an
admission
to
the
union.
we
did
not
come
in
on
an
absolute
equal
footing
as
the
rest
of
the
states.
we
have
a
very
restrictive
claim
on
that.
and
as
our
--
trying
to
outline
brief
in
my
reply
brief,
we
had
awful,
tough
time
to
come
into
state,
congress
wanted
us
to
become
--
join
up
with
the
new
mexico
economic
joint
statehood.
so,
the
result
of
our
people
voting
that
down,
that
they
did
impose
upon
us,
very
tough
restrictions.
it
was
due
to
the
fact
in
reading
the
history
behind
it,
some
flood
did
occur
in
new
mexico
during
territorial
days
on
grant
lands.
my
position
is
we
don't
have
the
benefit
of
the
swamp
bed.
specifically,
we
were
given
grant
and
lose
area
there
but
we
--
anything
in
the
nature
of
public
lands
or
grant
lands,
we
hold
in
trust
under
very
restrictive
covenance.
we
disclaim
in
our
constitution
all
claim
entitled
to
public
lands
and
union
lands.
now
the
effect
of
this
decision,
i
earnestly
submit
does
affect
indian
lands
and
particularly
the
fort
mohave.
i
mentioned
in
my
opening
brief
that
we
could
not
find
the
particular
withdrawals
of
the
fort
mohave.
it
is
only
last
week
that
i
was
able
to
get
to
the
library
of
congress
a
copy
of
the
two
arizona
with
all
others
in
march
18,
1972
which
created
camp
mohave
and
the
other
forts
there.
later
in
1910
1911,
president
taft
added
on
after
the
forts
have
been
conveyed
to
the
union,
added
on
that
no
where
in
the
arizona
withdrawn
waters
for
military
purposes
or
the
indian
withdrawn
waters
if
there
any
reservation
made
of
the
colorado
river.
and
based
upon
arizona
supreme
court
decision
in
morton
which
i
have
cited,
without
that
limitation
and
without
reserving
the
intent
to
reserve
that
river
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians,
then
under
our
arizona
supreme
court
decisions,
part
of
the
indian
reservation
has
been
taken
by
as
a
result
of
this
decision.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
was
it
necessary,
sir?
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
not
as
far
as
our
claims
are
concerned.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
completely
destroyed,
this
first
decision
said,
well
they
have
a
small
acreage
in
here,
in
the
southeast
corner
but
the
second
decision
goes
further
and
said
part
to
the
closing
of
the
gates
at
coolidge
--
at
hoover
dam
and
this
was
aligned
at
that
point.
for
example,
down
here
we
can
see
how
far
it
had
extended
there.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir
i
have
to.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
there
is
some
authority
your
honor.
i'm
sure
the
beaver
case,
i
believe
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
claridge
i’m
sure
mentioned
that
and
the
first
time
supreme
court
said
it
was
an
evulsive
change
and
therefore
the
title
--
the
title
did
not
change.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
that
is
what
they
claim,
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
that
was
what
they
said.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
no,
sir.
i
say
that
the
purpose,
your
honor,
of
the
grant
to
the
states
was
to
control
an
addable
thread
of
that
stream.
and
as
the
stream
was
changed,
as
the
stream
moved,
whether
evulsive
or
by
accretion
or
man-made
that
the
title
to
that
man-made
channel
for
the
purpose
of
which
is
of
servitude,
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
public’s
right
to
access
that
navigable
stream
is
what
the
intent
was
and
not
a
means
of
acquiring
the
exposed
land
after
the
channel
has
been
restored.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
i
would,
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
i
don’t
think
so.
i
do
not
think
the
court
has
ever
clearly
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
--
pointed
out
what
the
extent
of
this
grant
is,
that’s
my
point,
your
honor.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
under
the
pollard
case,
under
the
pollard
decision
where
to
put
them
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
remainder
of
the
states.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
period.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
by
the
power
of
the
grant,
yes
sir.
later
confirmed
by
the
swamp
--
that
swamp
act
didn’t
give
the
same
new
rights.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
that’s
right
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
that’s
exactly
it
and
do
they
retain
ownership
when
it
is
not
necessary
to
exercise
the
power
or
the
control
of
navigable
streams
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
so
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
i
think
so.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir,
evulsion
or
accretion.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir
as
recorded
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
the
case
were
again
in
view
of
peculiar
nature
and
restrictive
providence
in
our
constitution,
we
have
two
different
place
in
our
constitution
where
if
this
land
was
state
land.
the
only
manner
in
which
they
can
lease
it
or
sell
it
is
in
accordance
with
the
land
grants,
so
that
is
the
reason
i
have
said
time
and
time
again
and
mr.
samuel
did
agree,
our
legislature
feels
that
the
part
is
to
act
here,
in
time
to
protect
this
people.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
i
think
it
has
a
lot
of
relevance.
number
one
is
definitely
we
have
established
the
fact
that
federal
law
governs
here.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
no
sir.
mr.
shumway
may
have
a
different
view
point
but
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir
and
also
just
compensation,
you’re
taking
this
land
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
--without
paying
for
it.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir,
the
apparent,
no
the
hughes
case
is
identical
here
because
all
of
this
land
came
from
the
federal
government.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
presumably
it
was
your
honor,
and
because
we
could
not,
we
tried
to
find
some
intervening
evidence
between
the
1906
plan
upon
which
the
bonelli
land
was
transferred
conveyed
by
the
government
of
santa
fe
and
the
actual
date
of
the
patent.
of
course
the
law
it
is
and
i
do
not
have
it
cited
but
this
was
under
the
railroad
grant
act
of
i
believe
of
1865
and
this
court
has
held
that
the
grant
relates
back
to
that
time
that
provided
railroad
complied
with
the
law
which
they
did.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
can
i
have
this
several
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
the
bonelli
land
at
the
time
as
i
recall
was
almost
a
complete
section.
the
only
reason
it
was
not
a
full
section
was
because
there
was
a
portion
of
it
bounded
by
the
river
on
the
west
at
the
time.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
there’s
probably
more
land
on
the
other
side
now.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
it
would
cover
the
land
in
the
south
of
nevada.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
the
patent
and
part
of
it
is
in
nevada
and
there
is
an
action
pending
up
there
by
the
nevada
people.
another
question
which
i
think
is
quite
serious
and
i
believe
it’s
time
to
adopt
in
a
particular
case
like
this.
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
estoppel,
as
i
have
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
our
state
had
sat
back
over
six
years
in
statehood
and
some
40
years
since
the
colorado
river,
when
the
colorado
river
is
declared
navigable
over
the
objections
of
arizona.
and
then
nothing,
they
have
collected
taxes.
they
have
as
a
matter
of
law
they
some
will
agree
and
approve
subdivisions.
several
times
in
management
before
the
legislature,
they
have
not
legislated.
i
think
my
time
is
up.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
thank
you
sir.
i
just
want
to
point
out
one
thing
and
after
the
question
of
justice
white
upon
the
all
of
the
section
three
sir
at
the
time
of
patent
was
riparian.
if
we
look
at
the
township
plan
which
is
an
evidence
and
later
on
after
santa
fe
conveyed
out
to
different
parties.
but
the
section
three
there
was
conveyed
a
patent
to
santa
fe
by
the
united
states
was
riparian
to
the
river
at
that
channel.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir
on
this
township
plot,
mr.
justice
white,
i
just
outlined
the
bonelli
land
but
the
whole
section
as
described
by
lots
was
riparian,
i
mean
was
conveyed.
the
whole
section
east
to
the
colorado
river
and
boarding
the
colorado
river
was
conveyed.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
the
township
plot
was
surveyed
in
1906.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
all
i
do
is
describe
the
bonelli
land
but
my
point
was
if
this
section
three
was
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
that
what
i
see.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
no
sir.
that’s
correct,
i
was
thinking
about
the
parcel
of
section
three
at
that
point.
the
rest
of
the
patent
survey
in
the
record,
i
believe
there
are
extra
copies
here,
does
show
the
old
bank
of
the
colorado
river
in
the
left
bank
as
it
appeared
to
be
at
the
time
of
the
channelization.
that
in
affect,
i
believe
mr.
shumway
and
i
agree,
would
show
the
extent
of
the
claridge
decision
and
that
is
where
we
get
in
to
where
we
think
federal
law
should
apply
rather
than
supreme
--
arizona
supreme
court
decision
which
according
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
would
go
into
section
two
which
is
public
land
over
a
mile
to
the
west,
east.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
they
disregarded
the
claridge
case
entirely
because
they
said
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
arizona’s
action
as
against
to
individuals
and
ignored
it
--
specifically
ignored
the
clearage
decision.
although
mr.
shumway
here
who
participated
in
the
claridge
decision
prior
to
urge
on
the
court
that
perhaps
that’s
the
doctrine
we
should
adopt.
they
refused
to
adopt
it.
and
that
is
what,
that
is
the
reason
i
see
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
i
think
that’s
one
of
the
most
important
parts
here,
in
other
words
it’s
not
a
land
grabbing
or
either
a
land
grant
or
a
land
acquisition
--
specific
purpose
to
control
access
for
the
public
to
the
bed
of
that
river,
streambed.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
shumway
and
i
are
both
deeply
grateful
to
this
court
for
providing
us
the
opportunity
of
arguing
this
matter,
which
is
of
most
importance
not
only
to
the
state
of
arizona
but
its
citizens.
i
would
like
to
briefly
point
out
on
the
map,
which
is
the
most
recent
official
map
published
by
the
bureau
of
land
management.
the
area
along
colorado
river,
the
area
we
are
talking
about
if
i
may,
is
in
here.
now,
the
other
day
i
received--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
almost
identical
but
on
a
smaller
scale,
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
i
would
like
to
leave
this
in,
if
it
is
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
for
our
practical
purposes,
yes
sir.
from
the
arizona
planning
--
planning
commission
map
is
to
take
off
from
this
as
well
as
maybe
the
as
on
highway
department
map.
now
on
thursday,
i
received
on
the
mail
an
amicus
brief
by
the
cocopah
indians.
unfortunately,
i
could
not
spot
that
until
i,
through
the
good
eyes
of
the
united
states
attorney,
i
obtained
some
solicited
opinion
as
the
location
of
that
cocopah
reservation
in
this
area
here.
now,
exhibit
k,
to
go
get
started
with
the
facts
is
a
topographical
map
made
in
1902
and
1903.
it
shows
the
bonelli
land
in
red
and
the
river,
colorado
river
at
that
time.
i
know
it’s
hard
to
see
from
there
but--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir,
this
are
all
in
our
brief,
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir,
i
have
sent
exhibit
k.
exhibit
k.
there
are
only
--
the
only
two
exhibits
here
that
the
court
did
not
have
and
that’s
the
big
map
and
put
it
on
in
aerial
photo.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
the
bonelli
land
which
we
are
concerned
with
here.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
1902,
1903
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
the
river
is
zoned
about
a
mile
to
the
west.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
1903.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
1910
sir.
as
a
result
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
the
land
was
in
the
same
place.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
we
know
as
of
1906
on
the
plot
of
survey
was
filed
which
is
an
evidence,
that
the
river
was
along
in
here.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
1906.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
we
have
no
way
of
knowing,
your
honor.
we’re
trying
to
find
out
that
is
the
reason
we
had
to
submit
this
all
on
documentary
evidence
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
i
do
think
so.
i
think
at
the
time
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
no
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
i
take
the
position
that
--
we
have
to
take
the
position
that
the
title
passed
by
virtue
of
the
patent
in
1910,
based
upon
the
1906
official
plot
of
survey,
which
shows
that
this
was
riparian
to
the
river.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
no
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
we
do
not
know
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
now
mr.
shumway,
at
the
time
we
--
at
the
time
we
prepared
these
exhibits,
we
are
trying
to
get
everything
we
could
possibly
find
in
the
way
of
maps
or
documentary
evidence
that
would
show
the
location
of
the
river.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
now,
this
map
here
is
exhibit
e1
and
two.
e2
is
a
letter
from
the
regional
director
of
the
bill
of
reclamation;
what’s
in
this
map
an
outlining
of
colorado
river
in
the
area
that
we
are
talking
about,
the
bonelli
land.
after
channelization
and
showing
where
the
mark,
the
high
water
mark
was,
immediate
prior
to
channelization.
it
says
that
your
convenience
leads
the
bank
of
the
arctic
channel,
part
of
the
channelization
has
been
indicated
by
a
red
pencil.
now
this
is
exhibit
d
which
is
a
1960
mosaic,
from
vegas
dam
to
an
area
of
the
south
of
the
bonelli
land
in
which
flows
into
the
fort
mohave
indian
reservation.
now,
bullhead
city
at
that
time
is
shown
here.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
d
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
d,
d.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
and
that
is
in
the
agreed
statement
of
facts,
i
do
not
think,
your
honor
that
we
have
extra
copies
but
i
am
going
to
leave
this
with
the
court.
this
shows
the
bonelli
land
and
it
also
shows
very
clearly
on
this
area
where
the
colorado
river
at
one
time
flowed.
back
into
here,
some
three
miles
east
of
the
present
channel,
down
in
here,
back
over
in
here.
over
into
section
two
and
ten
and
any
of
the
indian
reservation
as
i
have
mentioned
in
the
brief,
very
clearly
shows
that
i
see
as
the
high
water
mark
as
defined
by
our
supreme
court
in
the
bonelli
decision.
this
is
an
aerial
photograph
taken
in
january
of
1972
by
nasa
at
an
altitude
of
65,000
feet.
these
photographs
were
prepared
and
furnished
by
the
arizona
highway
department
from
the
film
that
they
have
of
record.
now,
i
might
state
that
nasa
did
make
flights
of
the
complete
course
of
the
river.
now,
today
we
have
the
outline
of
the
same,
with
high
water
mark
or
at
one
time
we
believe
the
colorado
river
flowed
under
the
arizona
decision
but
between
1960
and
1972,
this
area
has
been
highly
developed
by
subdivisions
and
it’s
very
plainly
shown
here
also
the
increase
in
size
of
bullhead
city.
and
it
is
my
position
and
my
interpretation,
i
believe
mr.
shumway
substantially
believes
that
under
the
arizona
decisions,
this
whole
area
now
belongs
to
the
state
of
arizona
whereas
under
the
claridge
decision
it
will
be
a
small
area
and
here
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
1959
sir,
1960,
that’s
when
they
channel
this
area
in
here.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
no
sir
and
that
linked
up
to
the
point
that
i
want
to
make.
this
channel
--
pardon.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
i
have
only
put
this
out
tonight
for
the
purpose
of
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
preliminary.
the
sole
issue
--
really
the
only
issue
that
we
are
involved
here
is
what
is
the
line
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
on
a
navigable
stream
and
when
the
federal
government
comes
in
through
either
its
core
of
engineers
or
bureau
of
reclamation.
bureau
of
reclamation
in
this
part
and
channelize
the
river
under
the
theory
of
navigation
and
also
primarily
in
this
case,
to
conserve
water
for
irrigation
below.
this
channelization
has
just
commenced
and
it
is
going
to
proceed
in
different
areas.
my
main
concern
is
and
i
think
it
will
affect
all
of
us,
is
what
is
the
extent
--
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
grant
given
to
the
states
by
appellant
later
on
confirmed
as
a
swamp
bed.
does
it
extend
from
this
present
channel,
and
say
clear
over
here
some
three
miles
distance
where
the
river
once
flowed.
this
river,
i’ll
point
it
out
is
a
very
--
was
prior
to
the
hoover
dam,
a
very
violent
river.
sometimes
it
will
flow
over
here
and
sometimes
it
will
flow
over
here
according
to
the
amount
of
sediments
carried
down
and
automatically
would
make
one
channel
and
move.
in
this
particular
area,
the
movement
has
been
steady
from
west
to
east.
one
time
maybe
it
did
go
back
to
the
west.
i
can't
teach
you
that
it
was
ever
the
intent
to
grant
to
the
states
under
the
part
of
decision
in
the
swamp
bed.
the
means
by
which
to
acquire
large
areas
of
land,
the
only
purpose
be
into
that
grant
was
to
protect
the
public
in
access
to
the
navigable
stream
and
not
to
provide
large
areas
such
as
this
where
the
river
once
flowed
and
then
become
exposed.
we
ask
on
the
court
holds
that
the
channelization
actually
caused
an
evulsive
change
and
changed
the
--
and
did
not
change
the
ownership
of
this
land
which
was
exposed
by
the
channelization
in
the
state.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
i
think
we
have
to
agree
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
and
that
is
what
happened
here,
up
in
these
areas
--
some
of
these
areas
in
here,
there
was
no
channelization
because
it
was
already
chanellized.
although
at
one
time,
evidence
on
the
ground
indicates
the
river
was
some
distance
to
the
east
but
filled
up.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
well
of
course
under
the
beaver
case
and
under
the
claridge
case
perhaps
it
could
be
considered
as
the
construction
of
the
boulder
dam
and
the
closing
of
the
gates
could
be
considered
in
some
areas
as
an
evulsive
movement.
i
don’t
think
we
so
treat
it
here.
we
concede
between
the
time
the
gates
were
closed
in
1935
and
the
channelization
left
there
were
figures
in
this
river
still
east
of
the
bonelli
land.
we
have
some
aerials
in
the
file
and
we
should
have
bought
some
of
the
reproduced
but
they
are
with
agreed
to
statement
of
facts.
showing
the
flow
of
the
river
of
that
particular
time,
which
are
more
recent.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
as
to
whether
there
is
accretion
or
--
i'm
afraid
i’d
have
to
say
accretion
because
it
is
slow
and
the
reason
it
was
slow
is
because
there
is
so
much
silt
deposit
between
the
dam
and
these
areas
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
but
the
river
would
move,
and
would
have
--
there’s
quite
a
few
canyons
up
and
above
the
dam
and
there
is
a
large
portion
here
for
instance
that
in
flood
times
it
comes
down
and
carries
large
amounts
of
silt.
it
might
push
the
river
flow
at
the
west
side,
but
generally
speaking
the
river
move
eastward
because
of
your
bluster
in
here.
and
as
it
pile
the
silt
up
it
would
form
a
new
channel
or
a
series
channels
and
so
i
would
have
to
say
that
in
my
opinion
it
was
not
an
evulsive
movement
and
it
wasn’t
something
that
happened
overnight.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
accretive,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
some
places
down
in
the
yuma
area
where
the
large
floods
have
come,
it
was
considered
evulsive.
you
would
see
the
river
at
one
point,
one
day
in
a
pretty
good
size,
the
flood
had
come
down
and
it
had
moved
almost
overnight.
i
think
we
had
a
criminal
case
it
involved
that
move
in
the
arizona
supreme
court.
the
other
point
that
i
feel
is
of
most
important
and
i
raised
that
in
my
reply
brief,
i
raise
it
in
the
opening
brief
and
the
reply
brief
and
that
is
under
our
peculiar
circumstances
an
admission
to
the
union.
we
did
not
come
in
on
an
absolute
equal
footing
as
the
rest
of
the
states.
we
have
a
very
restrictive
claim
on
that.
and
as
our
--
trying
to
outline
brief
in
my
reply
brief,
we
had
awful,
tough
time
to
come
into
state,
congress
wanted
us
to
become
--
join
up
with
the
new
mexico
economic
joint
statehood.
so,
the
result
of
our
people
voting
that
down,
that
they
did
impose
upon
us,
very
tough
restrictions.
it
was
due
to
the
fact
in
reading
the
history
behind
it,
some
flood
did
occur
in
new
mexico
during
territorial
days
on
grant
lands.
my
position
is
we
don't
have
the
benefit
of
the
swamp
bed.
specifically,
we
were
given
grant
and
lose
area
there
but
we
--
anything
in
the
nature
of
public
lands
or
grant
lands,
we
hold
in
trust
under
very
restrictive
covenance.
we
disclaim
in
our
constitution
all
claim
entitled
to
public
lands
and
union
lands.
now
the
effect
of
this
decision,
i
earnestly
submit
does
affect
indian
lands
and
particularly
the
fort
mohave.
i
mentioned
in
my
opening
brief
that
we
could
not
find
the
particular
withdrawals
of
the
fort
mohave.
it
is
only
last
week
that
i
was
able
to
get
to
the
library
of
congress
a
copy
of
the
two
arizona
with
all
others
in
march
18,
1972
which
created
camp
mohave
and
the
other
forts
there.
later
in
1910
1911,
president
taft
added
on
after
the
forts
have
been
conveyed
to
the
union,
added
on
that
no
where
in
the
arizona
withdrawn
waters
for
military
purposes
or
the
indian
withdrawn
waters
if
there
any
reservation
made
of
the
colorado
river.
and
based
upon
arizona
supreme
court
decision
in
morton
which
i
have
cited,
without
that
limitation
and
without
reserving
the
intent
to
reserve
that
river
for
the
benefit
of
the
indians,
then
under
our
arizona
supreme
court
decisions,
part
of
the
indian
reservation
has
been
taken
by
as
a
result
of
this
decision.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
was
it
necessary,
sir?
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
not
as
far
as
our
claims
are
concerned.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
completely
destroyed,
this
first
decision
said,
well
they
have
a
small
acreage
in
here,
in
the
southeast
corner
but
the
second
decision
goes
further
and
said
part
to
the
closing
of
the
gates
at
coolidge
--
at
hoover
dam
and
this
was
aligned
at
that
point.
for
example,
down
here
we
can
see
how
far
it
had
extended
there.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir
i
have
to.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
there
is
some
authority
your
honor.
i'm
sure
the
beaver
case,
i
believe
by
the
ninth
circuit
and
claridge
i’m
sure
mentioned
that
and
the
first
time
supreme
court
said
it
was
an
evulsive
change
and
therefore
the
title
--
the
title
did
not
change.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
that
is
what
they
claim,
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
that
was
what
they
said.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
no,
sir.
i
say
that
the
purpose,
your
honor,
of
the
grant
to
the
states
was
to
control
an
addable
thread
of
that
stream.
and
as
the
stream
was
changed,
as
the
stream
moved,
whether
evulsive
or
by
accretion
or
man-made
that
the
title
to
that
man-made
channel
for
the
purpose
of
which
is
of
servitude,
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
public’s
right
to
access
that
navigable
stream
is
what
the
intent
was
and
not
a
means
of
acquiring
the
exposed
land
after
the
channel
has
been
restored.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
i
would,
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
i
don’t
think
so.
i
do
not
think
the
court
has
ever
clearly
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
--
pointed
out
what
the
extent
of
this
grant
is,
that’s
my
point,
your
honor.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
under
the
pollard
case,
under
the
pollard
decision
where
to
put
them
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
remainder
of
the
states.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
period.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
by
the
power
of
the
grant,
yes
sir.
later
confirmed
by
the
swamp
--
that
swamp
act
didn’t
give
the
same
new
rights.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
that’s
right
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
that’s
exactly
it
and
do
they
retain
ownership
when
it
is
not
necessary
to
exercise
the
power
or
the
control
of
navigable
streams
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
so
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
i
think
so.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir,
evulsion
or
accretion.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir
as
recorded
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
the
case
were
again
in
view
of
peculiar
nature
and
restrictive
providence
in
our
constitution,
we
have
two
different
place
in
our
constitution
where
if
this
land
was
state
land.
the
only
manner
in
which
they
can
lease
it
or
sell
it
is
in
accordance
with
the
land
grants,
so
that
is
the
reason
i
have
said
time
and
time
again
and
mr.
samuel
did
agree,
our
legislature
feels
that
the
part
is
to
act
here,
in
time
to
protect
this
people.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
i
think
it
has
a
lot
of
relevance.
number
one
is
definitely
we
have
established
the
fact
that
federal
law
governs
here.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
no
sir.
mr.
shumway
may
have
a
different
view
point
but
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir
and
also
just
compensation,
you’re
taking
this
land
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
--without
paying
for
it.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir,
the
apparent,
no
the
hughes
case
is
identical
here
because
all
of
this
land
came
from
the
federal
government.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
presumably
it
was
your
honor,
and
because
we
could
not,
we
tried
to
find
some
intervening
evidence
between
the
1906
plan
upon
which
the
bonelli
land
was
transferred
conveyed
by
the
government
of
santa
fe
and
the
actual
date
of
the
patent.
of
course
the
law
it
is
and
i
do
not
have
it
cited
but
this
was
under
the
railroad
grant
act
of
i
believe
of
1865
and
this
court
has
held
that
the
grant
relates
back
to
that
time
that
provided
railroad
complied
with
the
law
which
they
did.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
can
i
have
this
several
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
the
bonelli
land
at
the
time
as
i
recall
was
almost
a
complete
section.
the
only
reason
it
was
not
a
full
section
was
because
there
was
a
portion
of
it
bounded
by
the
river
on
the
west
at
the
time.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
there’s
probably
more
land
on
the
other
side
now.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
it
would
cover
the
land
in
the
south
of
nevada.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
the
patent
and
part
of
it
is
in
nevada
and
there
is
an
action
pending
up
there
by
the
nevada
people.
another
question
which
i
think
is
quite
serious
and
i
believe
it’s
time
to
adopt
in
a
particular
case
like
this.
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
estoppel,
as
i
have
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
our
state
had
sat
back
over
six
years
in
statehood
and
some
40
years
since
the
colorado
river,
when
the
colorado
river
is
declared
navigable
over
the
objections
of
arizona.
and
then
nothing,
they
have
collected
taxes.
they
have
as
a
matter
of
law
they
some
will
agree
and
approve
subdivisions.
several
times
in
management
before
the
legislature,
they
have
not
legislated.
i
think
my
time
is
up.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
thank
you
sir.
i
just
want
to
point
out
one
thing
and
after
the
question
of
justice
white
upon
the
all
of
the
section
three
sir
at
the
time
of
patent
was
riparian.
if
we
look
at
the
township
plan
which
is
an
evidence
and
later
on
after
santa
fe
conveyed
out
to
different
parties.
but
the
section
three
there
was
conveyed
a
patent
to
santa
fe
by
the
united
states
was
riparian
to
the
river
at
that
channel.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir
on
this
township
plot,
mr.
justice
white,
i
just
outlined
the
bonelli
land
but
the
whole
section
as
described
by
lots
was
riparian,
i
mean
was
conveyed.
the
whole
section
east
to
the
colorado
river
and
boarding
the
colorado
river
was
conveyed.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
the
township
plot
was
surveyed
in
1906.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
all
i
do
is
describe
the
bonelli
land
but
my
point
was
if
this
section
three
was
--
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
that
what
i
see.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
no
sir.
that’s
correct,
i
was
thinking
about
the
parcel
of
section
three
at
that
point.
the
rest
of
the
patent
survey
in
the
record,
i
believe
there
are
extra
copies
here,
does
show
the
old
bank
of
the
colorado
river
in
the
left
bank
as
it
appeared
to
be
at
the
time
of
the
channelization.
that
in
affect,
i
believe
mr.
shumway
and
i
agree,
would
show
the
extent
of
the
claridge
decision
and
that
is
where
we
get
in
to
where
we
think
federal
law
should
apply
rather
than
supreme
--
arizona
supreme
court
decision
which
according
to
the
arizona
supreme
court
would
go
into
section
two
which
is
public
land
over
a
mile
to
the
west,
east.
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
yes
sir.
they
disregarded
the
claridge
case
entirely
because
they
said
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
arizona’s
action
as
against
to
individuals
and
ignored
it
--
specifically
ignored
the
clearage
decision.
although
mr.
shumway
here
who
participated
in
the
claridge
decision
prior
to
urge
on
the
court
that
perhaps
that’s
the
doctrine
we
should
adopt.
they
refused
to
adopt
it.
and
that
is
what,
that
is
the
reason
i
see
mr.
elmer
c.
coker
i
think
that’s
one
of
the
most
important
parts
here,
in
other
words
it’s
not
a
land
grabbing
or
either
a
land
grant
or
a
land
acquisition
--
specific
purpose
to
control
access
for
the
public
to
the
bed
of
that
river,
streambed.
