connecticut,
connecticut,
as
i
understand
it
doesn’t
have
any
exemptions
relevant
to
this
case,
is
that
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
let’s
assume
the
federal
--
let’s
assume
that
the
court
decides
against
you,
on
both
on
your
points
i.e.
that
(a)
the
plaintiff
have
just
completed
arguing
that
the
whole
businesses
is
exempted
or
(b)
that
75%
is
exempt
under
the
federal
statute.
would
there
be
a
connecticut
statute
exempting
any
of
these?
justice
potter
stewart
so
probably
not.
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
of
course
it
would
be
subject
to
construction
as
to
whether
or
not
a
tax
refund
is
the
equivalent
of
wages
too?
justice
potter
stewart
but
in
any
event,
unlike
many
states,
there
isn’t
as
you
submitted
a
state
exemption
statute
that
cuts
much
significance
here
at
all,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
we
dealt
with
that
in
lines,
you
mentioned
it.
justice
potter
stewart
this
varies
from
district
to
district,
as
a
matter
of
sensibly
of
practice
or
policy?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
law
purport
to
give
the
trustee
that
kind
of
discretion?
justice
potter
stewart
the
statute
does
give
the
trustee
what,
the
discretion
to
abandon?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
and
this,
according
to
the
materials
in
the
brief
is
done
right
quite
routinely
in
california
apparently?
justice
potter
stewart
but,
then
--
justice
potter
stewart
but,
then
in
california,
when
--
how’s
the
abandonment
is
utilized
apparently
on
tax
refund
claims
below
a
certain
dollar
figure?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
so
it
isn’t
apparently
wholly
unworkable
or
impractical?
