justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
in
good
many
no
assets
cases
no
trustees
were
appointed
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
the
referee
himself
determines
the
no
asset
case
and
trustees
were
not
applied.
once
trustees
were
appointed,
you
do
have
a
problem
there
in
marshaling
assets,
then
there
must
be
a
decision
of
that
event.
i’m
not
sure
--
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
suggest
to
the
district
courts
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
how
about
for
situations,
where
administrative
expenses
would
eat
up
any
asset,
including
a
tax
refund?
wouldn’t
the
court
address
itself
to
those
situations?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
in
the
second
circuit,
i
take
it
this
question
about
tax
refund
will
never
arise
unless
there’s
a
possibility
of
a
distribution
of
creditors
after
administrative
expenses
would
be
paid?
justice
byron
r.
white
anytime
predicted
administrative
expenses
would
eat
up
for
the
assets,
including
the
tax
refund,
there
won’t
be
any
trustee
appointed
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
what
if
the
bankrupt
has
owning
to
him
six
months
of
unpaid
wages,
say
his
employer
is
in
financial
trouble
and
he
just
hasn’t
pay
them.
and
then,
the
employee
goes
in
the
bankruptcy,
because
he
can't
pay
his
bills
either.
now,
the
wages
owing
him
are
property
that
past
the
trustee,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
the
federal
law
doesn’t
particularly
make
that
an
exempt,
that
the
wages
are
an
the
exempt
item?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
not
excluded
for
not
--
but,
because
they
are
not
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
are
deemed
to
be
property,
they
wouldn’t
be
exempt,
wouldn’t
have
to
exempt
them,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you’re
proposition
is
and
my
example
i
gave
you
that
if
a
bankrupt
has
six
months
of
back
wages
due
him
from
his
employer,
he
may
collect
them
from
his
employer
and
not
turn
them
over
to
the
trustee?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
really
your
proposition?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
really
can't
cite
anything
under
the
bankruptcy
act
that
would
let
him
keep
six
months
worth
of
back
wages?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don’t
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn’t
that
be
so
uncommon?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
my
example
is
not
the
situation
of
lines,
at
least
in
lines
the
amount
that
was
involved
there,
on
its
face
was
to
sustain
a
person
for
a
future
period.
justice
byron
r.
white
not
so
in
my
example,
when
the
wages
were
payable
at
the
time
and
not
so
apparently
in
the
case
we
have
before
it
because
the
withheld
wages
weren’t
to
sustain
him
at
all
if
they
were
to
be
taken
away
from
him
and
pay
to
the
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
the
state
law
might
exempt
wages
up
to
that
certain
amount
and
so
the
exemption
section
might
think
that,
it
might
think
some
of
those
wages
(inaudible).
justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
what
distributing
in
the
bankruptcy
(inaudible)
wages?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
drove
him
in
the
bankruptcy?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
in
no
asset
cases
just
a
matter
of
pointing
trustees?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
appointment
--
in
every
case,
trustees
are
appointed?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
referees
don’t
know
whether
to
believe
it,
so
they
appointed
trustees?
