of
course,
if
one
were
to
follow
that
argument,
i
suppose
you
might
just
as
well
give
up
the
idea
of
having
any
kind
of
a
bankrupt
turnover
any
property?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william

rehnquist
and
there’s
very
seldom
anything
left
for
distribution
to
creditors
in
a
large
majority
in
those
cases?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
the
trustee
didn’t
abandon
the
$660.00
in
cedor
case,
did
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
petitioner’s
argument
is
that
most
of
the
things
you
mentioned
are
voluntarily
undertaken
by
the
wage
earner
was
the
income
tax
withholding
is
not
voluntary?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
surely
the
administration
of
a
nationwide
bankruptcy
act
can't
depend
on
whether
or
not
a
particular
asset
that’s
claimed
to
be
property,
is
or
is
not
“substantial?”
then
we
just
have
an
endless
line
of
cases
through
the
federal
courts,
saying
a
$150.00
wasn’t
substantial,
but
$600.00
was.

in
the
district

arizona,
where
you
have
all
sorts
of
no
asset,
wage
earner
cases,
where
there
really
wasn’t
any
doubt
about
the
fact
that
there
were
no
assets,
the
same
was
true
in
colorado?
