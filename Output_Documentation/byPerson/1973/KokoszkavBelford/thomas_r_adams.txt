mr.
thomas
r.
adams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
question
of
interpretation
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
question
is
whether
a
wage
earner’s
postbankruptcy
receipt
of
his
tax
refund
check
is
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
bankrupt
contends
that
the
disposition
of
this
case
should
be
controlled
by
this
court’s
decision
four
years
ago
in
lines
versus
frederick.
in
lines,
the
court
analyzed
the
meaning
of
the
word
“property”
and
rejected
a
mechanistic
accounting-type
approach
to
defining
property.
for
example,
lines
involved
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
bankrupt’s
vacation
pay
was
property.
it
was
clear
in
lines
that
the
vacation
pay
was
entirely
earned
and
accrued
at
the
time
of
the
bankruptcy
and
it
was
also
clear
that
the
vacation
pay
was
the
result
of
labor
that
had
been
preformed
in
a
prebankruptcy
past.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
similar.
mr.
kokoszka,
the
bankrupt
was
employed
for
three-and-a-half
months
in
the
year
1971.
he
claimed
the
correct
number
of
exemptions
with
his
employer
for
withholding
purposes
and
he
became
entitled
to
a
tax
refund
check
of
$251.00
because
the
withholding
was
based
on
the
premise
that
he
would
be
employed
for
the
entire
year.
thus,
when
mr.
kokoszka
filed
his
bankruptcy
in
1972,
his
tax
refund
check,
like
the
vacation
pay
in
lines
was
entirely
accrued
and
earned
at
the
time
of
bankruptcy
and
it
was
the
result
of
prebankruptcy
labor.
in
lines,
this
court
specifically
stated
that
the
definition
of
property
cannot
be
resolved
by
reference
to
such
questions
as
the
time
of
vesting.
instead,
the
court
emphasized
that
more
traditional
test,
as
in
segal
versus
rochelle
that
property
should
be
defined
by
reference
to
the
purpose
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
in
this
regard,
the
court
must
analyze
the
relationship
of
the
asset
in
question
to
the
debtor’s
fresh
start
and
a
possible
entanglement
of
the
asset
in
a
debtor’s
prebankruptcy
past.
utilizing
this
analysis
in
the
lines
case,
certain
important
factors
were
present,
which
resulted
in
that
decision
and
those
same
factors
are
present
in
this
case.
for
example,
the
tax
refund
check
does
not
represent
an
investment
or
savings
account,
or
some
other
voluntary
form
of
property.
it
is
entirely
the
result
of
involuntary
actions
as
the
result
of
the
withholding
laws
of
the
united
states,
as
vacation
pay
--
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
yes,
the
designation
of
it,
but
he
claimed
the
proper
number
of
exemptions
as
he
should
do
under
the
law,
in
order
to
approximately
end
up
with
either
no
tax
refund
check
or
no
tax
is
due
at
the
end
of
the
year.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
yes,
i
do
think
the
case
would
be
different,
because
in
that
case,
for
example,
if
he
had
not
claimed
as
many
exemptions
as
we
he
was
entitled
to,
the
funding
question
would
be
similar
to
a
savings
account,
he
would
have
created
a
greater
tax
refund
check.
now,
in
the
--
one
of
the
cases
that’s
discussed
this
issue,
the
cedor
case,
the
opinion
of
the
judge
in
the
northern
district
of
california,
specifically
held
that
because
that
part
of
the
tax
refund
check
was
a
result
of
voluntary
activity,
that
it
should
be
regarded
as
property
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
in
this
case,
we’re
dealing
with
the
tax
refund
check
that
was
result
of
no
particular
voluntary
action
by
the
bankrupt,
except
that
he
was
just
complying
with
the
tax
laws.
another
important
aspect
of
this
asset,
an
important
aspect
that
was
also
present
in
lines
is
that
the
tax
refund
check
is
not
received
until
after
the
bankruptcy.
it
is
a
postbankruptcy
event,
part
of
the
debtor’s
future.
like
vacation
pay,
it
is
not
particularly
reachable
or
payable
to
the
bankrupt,
until
the
time
that
it
is
actually
received.
in
mr.
kokoszka’s
case,
he
filed
his
bankruptcy
on
january
5,
1972.
he
filed
his
income
tax
return
in
february
and
he
received
his
tax
refund
check
about
two
months
later.
thus,
vacation
pay,
like
the
tax
refund
check
importantly
is
a
postbankruptcy
event,
and
part
of
the
debtor’s
future,
but
perhaps
the
most
important
aspect
of
the
lines
case
is
that
vacation
pay
was
entirely
wages.
in
this
case,
similarly
the
tax
refund
check
here
is
derived
entirely
from
wages.
it
consists
entirely
of
wages.
the
bankrupt
has
been
compelled
to
accept
the
delayed
receipt
of
wages,
which
he
otherwise
would
have
received,
as
a
result
of
the
withholding
laws
of
the
united
states.
but,
for
the
withholding
laws,
this
money
would
have
been
available
for
his
use
and
he
would
have
used
it
for
his
support
at
the
time
of
his
regular
pay
check.
the
ninth
circuit’s
decision,
the
cedor
case
and
the
eighth
circuit
decision,
the
gehrig
case
focused
on
the
practical
realities
of
the
importance
of
wages
to
a
bankrupt.
a
bankruptcy,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
and
as
those
courts
referred
to
is
frequently
a
last
resort
for
a
debtor.
he
has
used
up
all
his
assets
by
the
time
he’s
forced
to
go
into
bankruptcy.
he
depends
entirely
on
his
receipt
of
future
wages,
in
order
to
make
his
fresh
start.
in
mr.
kokoszka’s
case,
he
earned
only
$2,400.00
in
1971.
at
that
level
of
earning,
all
of
the
person’s
wages
are
necessary
for
items
of
immediate
support
and
consumption,
as
this
court
noted
in
the
case
of
james
versus
strange.
additionally,
lines
was
a
confluence
of
streams
of
decisional
law,
both
in
the
bankruptcy
act
and
outside
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
in
lines,
the
court
quoted
and
emphasized
its
holding
in
sniadach
that
wages
were
specialized
kind
of
property
in
our
system.
both
the
cedor
court
and
the
gehrig
court
felt
that
given
the
specialized
nature
of
wages
and
a
condition
of
the
bankrupt
that
to
deprive
the
bankrupt
of
his
tax
refund
check
would
work
in
equivalent
hardship
as
to
deprive
him
of
his
vacation
pay.
perhaps
the
more
so,
because
the
debtor
has
already
been
forced
to
accept
the
delayed
payment
of
these
wages,
which
he
needed.
in
any
event,
the
contention
of
the
bankrupt
in
this
case
is
that
the
tax
refund
check
is
as
important
a
part
of
the
family
budget,
as
vacation
pay.
now,
the
court
below,
the
second
circuit
did
not
apply
this
same
analysis
and
attempted
to
distinguish
lines
versus
frederick
in
this
regard,
by
claiming
that
vacation
pay
was
a
periodic
wage
payment,
like
a
person’s
regular
pay
check,
whereas
this
is
not.
that
court’s
distinction,
we
submit,
is
both
unrealistic
and
not
in
keeping
with
this
court’s
decision
in
the
lines
case.
it
is
unrealistic
because
a
debtor
needs
his
wages
for
support,
whether
they
are
paid
to
him
on
a
regular
basis
or
not,
they
are
just
as
important
for
his
fresh
start.
the
second
circuit’s
distinction
is
not
consistent
with
lines
versus
frederick,
because
in
lines
this
court
rejected
focusing
on
technical
distinctions,
such
as
whether
or
not
the
property
was
paid
in
a
periodic
way
or
not
and
focused
instead
on
a
broader
examination
and
the
practical
realities
to
the
bankrupt
and
the
relationship
of
the
asset
to
the
debtor’s
fresh
start.
another
important
case,
cited
by
the
court
below
was
segal
versus
rochelle.
that
brings
us
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
asset
is
in
some
way
entangled
in
the
debtor’s
prebankruptcy
past.
the
second
test,
which
this
court
has
emphasized,
a
bankrupt’s
position
in
this
case
is
that
segal
versus
rochelle
does
not
require
result
contrary
to
what
the
bankrupt
is
urging.
in
that
case,
we
dealt
with
the
business
bankrupt,
who
is
entitled
to
receive
a
loss
carry
back
refund.
as
this
court
noted
in
lines,
segal
really
wasn’t
a
fresh
start
case.
in
segal,
a
business
has
ceased
to
operate,
and
the
job
of
the
trustee
was
simply
to
marshal
the
assets
for
the
benefit
of
the
creditors.
also,
there
is
not
causal
link
to
the
prebankruptcy
past
in
this
case,
as
the
court
found
important
in
the
case
of
segal
versus
rochelle.
there,
the
court
noted
the
peculiar
nature
of
a
loss
carry
back
refund
check
and
found
that
it
was
the
result
of
those
very
losses,
which
had
precipitated
the
bankruptcy.
there
is
no
such
problem
here.
thus,
to
summarize
this
part
of
the
bankrupt’s
position,
we
contend
that
lines
requires
the
court
in
examining
the
definition
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
“property”
focus
on
practical
realities
and
to
analyze
the
relationship
of
the
asset
to
the
debtor’s
fresh
start.
lines
marked
the
rejection
of
more
mechanical
approach
to
defining
property,
by
focusing
on
whether
or
not
when
it
was
earned,
when
it
was
accrued,
whether
it
was
a
result
of
prebankruptcy
labor.
instead,
lines
focused
on
the
relationship
of
the
asset
to
the
debtor’s
fresh
start.
the
fact
that
it
was
not
an
investment
or
other
kind
of
voluntary
creation
that
it
was
a
postbankruptcy
event
and
that
it
was
inconsistent
entirely
of
wages,
which
traditionally
are
the
only
means
for
bankrupt
to
achieve
his
fresh
start.
thus
in
lines,
this
court
held
that
the
wages
represented
by
vacation
pay
were
essential
to
a
debtor’s
fresh
start.
seven
months
later,
in
perez
versus
campbell,
the
court
also
held
that
a
debtor
shouldn’t
be
deprived
of
his
driver’s
license
because
of
the
burden
that
that
would
place
on
his
earnings.
the
position
of
the
bankrupt
in
this
case
is
that
the
tax
refund
check,
being
wages,
the
loss
of
a
tax
refund
check
would
be
as
serious
of
a
burden
on
a
debtor’s
fresh
start,
as
the
loss
of
vacation
pay,
or
the
loss
of
a
driver’s
license.
the
second
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
federal
wage
exemption
statute,
the
consumer
credit
protection
act
exempts
75%
of
the
tax
refund
check.
the
court
need
not
reach
this
issue
if
it
rules
in
the
bankrupt’s
favor
on
the
first
question.
however,
we
contend
that
the
ccpa
should
apply
by
the
terms
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
by
terms
of
the
ccpa
for
an
independent
policy
reason
and
that
--
by
reference
to
administrative
materials.
first
the
bankruptcy
act,
many
exemption
statutes,
state
exemption
statutes
do
not
ever
refer
to
bankruptcy.
they
are
not
written
particularly
with
bankruptcy
in
mind,
but
they
apply
to
a
person
who
goes
bankrupt
because
the
bankruptcy
act
requires
that
they
apply.
it
specifically
stated
in
section
6
that
the
bankrupt
be
allowed
all
states
and
federal
exemptions.
the
ccpa,
being
a
partial,
federal
wage
exemption
statute
should
apply
to
bankruptcy
by
the
requirements
of
the
bankruptcy
act
in
section
6.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
essentially,
that’s
right
mr.
justice.
there
is
a
wage
exemption
statute
which
being
smaller
than
the
federal
statute
in
this
case
was
not
applied.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
to
be
honest,
i
am
not
sure.
there
is
a
federal
wage
exemption
--
or
i
mean
excuse
connecticut
wage
exemption
statute.
it
only
applies
to
consumer
credit,
garnishments
for
consumer
credits
so
i
--
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
i
don’t
think
it
would
apply,
but
that
would
be
a
question
interpretation
of
connecticut
law,
which
doesn’t
presently
exist.
in
any
event,
it
probably
only
protect
about
$65.00,
if
it
did
apply.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
there
would
a
number
of
problems
interpreting
the
connecticut
statute
to
get
it
to
apply.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
that’s
correct
your
honor,
that’s
correct.
for
example,
in
california,
which
is
known
for
having
liberal
exemption
statutes,
only
50%
of
the
earnings
attributable
to
the
last
30
days
would
be
exempt,
so
a
cash
refund
check
would
come
to
a
very
small
percentage.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
yes,
you
referred
to
it
specifically.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
was
it
two
to
one?
yes,
it
was
two
to
one,
that’s
right,
excuse
me
mr.
justice.
let
me
just
--
although
the
lines
issue
is
often
thought
to
be
the
main
issue
in
this
case
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
just
referred
to
it,
the
value
to
the
bankrupt
of
the
application
of
the
75%
federal
exemption
statute
is
an
important
right,
which
we
are
seriously
urging
before
this
court.
well,
i
was
saying
a
number
of
state
exemptions
statutes
apply
not
because
in
their
own
terms
they
refer
it
all
to
application
in
bankruptcy
or
because
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
in
the
ccpa,
we
have
a
slightly
different
statute.
it
should
apply
in
a
bankruptcy
context
not
only
on
account
of
bankruptcy
act,
but
on
account
of
its
own
terms.
congress
specifically
stated
that
the
ccpa
was
passed
in
order
to
achieve
the
uniform
application
of
the
bankruptcy
loss.
in
this
case,
a
uniform
wage
exemption
statute
rather
than
the
widely
varying
wage
exemption
statutes
which
apply
in
the
states.
most
of
the
criticism
in
the
ccpa,
both
by
the
court
below,
by
the
gehrig
court
and
by
opposing
counsel
has
been
an
attempt
to
narrow
the
meaning
and
the
terms
of
the
ccpa.
the
examination
of
that
statute
however
shows
that
it
is
a
broad
statute,
very
broadly
drafted
by
congress,
and
additionally
being
a
remedial
statute,
it
is
entitled
to
be
liberally
construed
in
favor
of
achieving
its
purposes.
thirdly,
there
is
a
policy
ground
for
the
application
of
the
ccpa.
this
was
noted
by
the
district
court
in
the
cedor
case,
involving
a
question
of
fairness
that
creditors,
the
exemption
should
not
be
defeated
and
creditors
should
not
be
allowed
to
get
the
entire
tax
refund
check
merely
because
the
debtor
has
been
forced
to
accept
the
delayed
receipt
of
that
money
due
to
the
operation
of
the
withholding
laws.
finally
in
this
regard,
there
are
number
of
administrative
materials,
which
are
cited
in
our
brief,
which
support
our
position,
our
interpretation
of
this
act
and
its
application
of
this
situation
and
those
administrative
materials
are
entitled
a
great
weight.
in
conclusion,
an
examination
of
the
relationship
of
this
asset
to
the
debtor’s
fresh
start
in
the
same
practical
way
this
court
made
that
analysis
in
lines
should
yield
a
result
that
a
wage
earner’s
postbankruptcy
receipt
of
his
tax
refund
check
is
not
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
as
far
as
the
federal
wage
exemption
statute
is
concerned,
it
should
apply
here
by
the
terms
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
it
should
apply
by
the
terms
of
the
ccpa
or
an
independent
policy
reason,
and
by
reference
to
supporting
administrative
materials.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
take
a
few
moments
to
discuss
some
brief
items
in
rebuttal.
first,
i
want
to
object
to
characterization
of
the
bankrupt’s
position
in
this
case
that
we’re
arguing
at
any
time
of
the
bankrupt
has
some
sort
of
needs
that
the
bankruptcy
act
letting
to
keep
some
property
or
that
we’re
arguing
that
all
property
derived
from
wages
is
somehow
not
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
now,
it’s
true
that
there
is
a
material
in
our
brief
on
the
needs
to
the
bankrupt
here,
but
that
material
is
there
to
emphasize
an
important
point.
and
as
this
court
found
in
lines
versus
frederick,
wages
are
special
kind
of
asset
in
our
system.
the
material
on
mr.
kokoszka’s
situation
and
material
on
his
needs
are
there
to
show
the
importance
of
wages.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
well,
that’s
a
similar
example
as
was
dealt
with
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
vinnie
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
i
think
the
federal
law,
as
far
as
the
exemption
statute
is
concerned,
the
federal
law
protects
wages
whether
they’re
paid
or
yet
payable.
so,
if
the
wages
held
by
the
employer
are
already
been
paid,
they
would
be
exempt
if
the
employer
was
holding
in
account
of
wages
due,
so
that
wages
were
payable
(voice

mr.
thomas
r.
adams
well,
i
was
--
excuse
me
i
was
getting
to
that
point,
i
thought
you’d
move
on
to
the
exemption
statute
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
well,
conceptually
that’s
true.
i
think
the
problem
--
i
would
argue
mr.
justice
white,
that
they
would
not
be
property
under
the
bankruptcy.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
and,
i
think
that
the
same
reasons
would
apply.
it
was
involuntarily
created
asset,
it’s
derived
entirely
from
wages
and
it’s
received
entirely
as
a
postbankruptcy
event.
in
many
ways
--
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
i
would
like
to
point,
you
mean
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
i’d
like
to
say
it
wasn’t
my
proposition,
[laughter
attempt]
because
it’s
a
very
hard
example,
but
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
what
i
would
say
to
that
point
is
that
the
bankrupt
in
that
situation,
i
mean,
i
wouldn’t
be
interested
in
the
examination
of
additional
facts.
i
think
you
can
see
that,
that
is
in
a
very
exceptional
circumstance,
but
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
under
the
straight
analysis
--
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
i
think
in
my
experience,
as
a
bankruptcy
attorney,
i’ve
never
seen
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
that’s
correct.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
i
think
the
only
real
difference
your
case,
mr.
justice
white,
and
the
case
of
bar
is
that
you’ve
just
given
me
an
example,
where
there’s
potentially
a
very
large
amount
of
money
involved,
whereas
typically
we
have
a
very
small
amount
of
money
involved
in
a
tax
refund
case.
now,
i
don’t
think
that’s
a
distinction.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
well,
let
me
get
to
my
point,
mr.
justice
white
and
that
is
i
think
that
the
situation
in
the
example
that
you
have
given
is
one
where
we
have
--
you’re
talking
about
a
fund
of
wages,
which
would
have
never
been
available
in
a
practical
sense
for
the
creditors
if
they
didn’t
paid
out
--
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
well
--
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
the
wages,
i
want
to
speak
in
terms
of
a
practical
matter
here,
wages
are
75%
exempt
at
least,
according
to
the
federal
stature,
in
order
for
the
creditors
to
obtain
those
wages,
there
are
number
of
state
law,
procedural
safeguards,
as
well
as
federal
constitutional
safeguards.
now,
this
fund
has
been
created,
which
has
only
increased
the
incredible
hardships
on
the
bankrupt.
now,
i
think
that
although
what
we’re
talking
about
in
your
case
is
a
substantial
fund
of
money
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
bankrupt,
it
was
also
a
substantial
loss,
a
deprivation
of
wages,
which
he
needed
for
his
support
in
the
past.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
threw
him
in
a
bankruptcy.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
no,
i
--
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
agree
entirely
on
that
point.
i
was
stating
that
although
i
felt
the
only
distinction
between
our
case
and
mr.
justice
white’s
example
was
the
size.
i
don’t
think
that
is
a
valid
way
to
distinguish
the
assets
within
the
meaning
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
although
i
would
note
that
if
the
court
is
concerned
about
the
line
drawing
problem
in
this
case,
which
is
really
only
presented
in
my
view
by
exceptional
circumstances,
another
alternative
is
to
apply
the
federal
wage
exemption
statute
to
the
tax
refund
check,
which
clearly
does
draw
lines
such
established
by
congress.
i
would
like
to
go
on
and
discuss
the
problem
of
abandonment.
the
second
circuit
suggested
that
abandonment
was
an
alternative.
i
don’t
think
in
the
first
place
it's
a
practical
alternative.
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
schedules,
the
referee
is
not
going
to
know,
especially
if
a
tax
refund
check
hasn’t
been
received
yet
or
returned,
hasn’t
even
been
filed,
whether
or
not
they
are
going
to
be
any
assets
in
the
estate.
once
he
appoints
a
trustee,
he
is
going
to
feel
that
he’s
going
to
have
to
pay
that
trustee,
whether
or
not
any
of
the
assets
are
going
to
passed
on
to
the
creditors.
secondly,
it's
gong
to
resolve
to
non-uniform
application
of
the
bankruptcy
laws,
the
material
in
our
brief,
the
stanley
and
girth
material
supports
that.
thirdly,just
as
a
practical
matter
abandonment
is
never
used
or
used
very
rarely
in
the
administration
of
the
bankruptcy
courts.
since,
that
is
supported
also
by
the
stanley
and
girth
survey,
since
the
kokoszka
opinion,
we
have
done
a
survey
of
our
own,
which
i
can
submit
to
the
court
with
its
permission
in
a
form
of
an
affidavit
from
one
of
the
attorneys
in
this
case,
demonstrating
that
in
the
second
circuit
since
the
kokoszka’s
opinion,
there
haven’t
been
any
abandonments
pursuant
to
that
opinion.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
well,
although
that’s
an
alternative
that
is
recognized
by
the
--
it’s
never
done,
it’s
never
done.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
in
very
rare
cases.
the
reason
being
that
the
referees
don’t
know
whether
or
not
to
believe
in
the
material,
on
the
schedules
or
not
and
they
want
to
point
someone
to
look
into
it
(voice
overlapping)
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
right,
to
look
into
this
situation
and
once
they
do,
then
you’re
caught
up
in
a
circle
again.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
[laughter]
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
no,
it’s
a
trustee
is
appointed
in
california
in
virtually
every
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
similarly,
in
connecticut,
where
mr.
kokoszka
come
--
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
there
are
court
rules,
as
to
a
$115.00
tax
refund
check
was
established
in
some
districts
in
southern
california.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
well,
i
don’t
know
mr.
justice
stewart
as
to
whether
or
not
fees
and
so
on
had
to
come
from
some
other
area
in
the
application
of
that
rule,
but
i
know
that
as
a
practical
matter,
that
referees
feel
that
they
don’t
--
they
can't
believe
the
bankrupt
necessarily
may
want
to
appoint
a
trustee
to
see
if
there
were
other
assets,
savings
account,
that
sort
of
thing.
finally,
i
just
like
to
say
that
as
to
the
gehrig
court’s
analysis
of
the
ccpa
issue,
they
were
dealing
only
with
an
analysis
of
the
voluntary
aspects
of
the
tax
refund
check
that
had
been
created
due
to
over
withholding.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
i
welcome
the
privilege.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
question
of
interpretation
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
question
is
whether
a
wage
earner’s
postbankruptcy
receipt
of
his
tax
refund
check
is
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
bankrupt
contends
that
the
disposition
of
this
case
should
be
controlled
by
this
court’s
decision
four
years
ago
in
lines
versus
frederick.
in
lines,
the
court
analyzed
the
meaning
of
the
word
“property”
and
rejected
a
mechanistic
accounting-type
approach
to
defining
property.
for
example,
lines
involved
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
bankrupt’s
vacation
pay
was
property.
it
was
clear
in
lines
that
the
vacation
pay
was
entirely
earned
and
accrued
at
the
time
of
the
bankruptcy
and
it
was
also
clear
that
the
vacation
pay
was
the
result
of
labor
that
had
been
preformed
in
a
prebankruptcy
past.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
similar.
mr.
kokoszka,
the
bankrupt
was
employed
for
three-and-a-half
months
in
the
year
1971.
he
claimed
the
correct
number
of
exemptions
with
his
employer
for
withholding
purposes
and
he
became
entitled
to
a
tax
refund
check
of
$251.00
because
the
withholding
was
based
on
the
premise
that
he
would
be
employed
for
the
entire
year.
thus,
when
mr.
kokoszka
filed
his
bankruptcy
in
1972,
his
tax
refund
check,
like
the
vacation
pay
in
lines
was
entirely
accrued
and
earned
at
the
time
of
bankruptcy
and
it
was
the
result
of
prebankruptcy
labor.
in
lines,
this
court
specifically
stated
that
the
definition
of
property
cannot
be
resolved
by
reference
to
such
questions
as
the
time
of
vesting.
instead,
the
court
emphasized
that
more
traditional
test,
as
in
segal
versus
rochelle
that
property
should
be
defined
by
reference
to
the
purpose
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
in
this
regard,
the
court
must
analyze
the
relationship
of
the
asset
in
question
to
the
debtor’s
fresh
start
and
a
possible
entanglement
of
the
asset
in
a
debtor’s
prebankruptcy
past.
utilizing
this
analysis
in
the
lines
case,
certain
important
factors
were
present,
which
resulted
in
that
decision
and
those
same
factors
are
present
in
this
case.
for
example,
the
tax
refund
check
does
not
represent
an
investment
or
savings
account,
or
some
other
voluntary
form
of
property.
it
is
entirely
the
result
of
involuntary
actions
as
the
result
of
the
withholding
laws
of
the
united
states,
as
vacation
pay
--
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
yes,
the
designation
of
it,
but
he
claimed
the
proper
number
of
exemptions
as
he
should
do
under
the
law,
in
order
to
approximately
end
up
with
either
no
tax
refund
check
or
no
tax
is
due
at
the
end
of
the
year.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
yes,
i
do
think
the
case
would
be
different,
because
in
that
case,
for
example,
if
he
had
not
claimed
as
many
exemptions
as
we
he
was
entitled
to,
the
funding
question
would
be
similar
to
a
savings
account,
he
would
have
created
a
greater
tax
refund
check.
now,
in
the
--
one
of
the
cases
that’s
discussed
this
issue,
the
cedor
case,
the
opinion
of
the
judge
in
the
northern
district
of
california,
specifically
held
that
because
that
part
of
the
tax
refund
check
was
a
result
of
voluntary
activity,
that
it
should
be
regarded
as
property
under
the
bankruptcy
act.
in
this
case,
we’re
dealing
with
the
tax
refund
check
that
was
result
of
no
particular
voluntary
action
by
the
bankrupt,
except
that
he
was
just
complying
with
the
tax
laws.
another
important
aspect
of
this
asset,
an
important
aspect
that
was
also
present
in
lines
is
that
the
tax
refund
check
is
not
received
until
after
the
bankruptcy.
it
is
a
postbankruptcy
event,
part
of
the
debtor’s
future.
like
vacation
pay,
it
is
not
particularly
reachable
or
payable
to
the
bankrupt,
until
the
time
that
it
is
actually
received.
in
mr.
kokoszka’s
case,
he
filed
his
bankruptcy
on
january
5,
1972.
he
filed
his
income
tax
return
in
february
and
he
received
his
tax
refund
check
about
two
months
later.
thus,
vacation
pay,
like
the
tax
refund
check
importantly
is
a
postbankruptcy
event,
and
part
of
the
debtor’s
future,
but
perhaps
the
most
important
aspect
of
the
lines
case
is
that
vacation
pay
was
entirely
wages.
in
this
case,
similarly
the
tax
refund
check
here
is
derived
entirely
from
wages.
it
consists
entirely
of
wages.
the
bankrupt
has
been
compelled
to
accept
the
delayed
receipt
of
wages,
which
he
otherwise
would
have
received,
as
a
result
of
the
withholding
laws
of
the
united
states.
but,
for
the
withholding
laws,
this
money
would
have
been
available
for
his
use
and
he
would
have
used
it
for
his
support
at
the
time
of
his
regular
pay
check.
the
ninth
circuit’s
decision,
the
cedor
case
and
the
eighth
circuit
decision,
the
gehrig
case
focused
on
the
practical
realities
of
the
importance
of
wages
to
a
bankrupt.
a
bankruptcy,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
and
as
those
courts
referred
to
is
frequently
a
last
resort
for
a
debtor.
he
has
used
up
all
his
assets
by
the
time
he’s
forced
to
go
into
bankruptcy.
he
depends
entirely
on
his
receipt
of
future
wages,
in
order
to
make
his
fresh
start.
in
mr.
kokoszka’s
case,
he
earned
only
$2,400.00
in
1971.
at
that
level
of
earning,
all
of
the
person’s
wages
are
necessary
for
items
of
immediate
support
and
consumption,
as
this
court
noted
in
the
case
of
james
versus
strange.
additionally,
lines
was
a
confluence
of
streams
of
decisional
law,
both
in
the
bankruptcy
act
and
outside
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
in
lines,
the
court
quoted
and
emphasized
its
holding
in
sniadach
that
wages
were
specialized
kind
of
property
in
our
system.
both
the
cedor
court
and
the
gehrig
court
felt
that
given
the
specialized
nature
of
wages
and
a
condition
of
the
bankrupt
that
to
deprive
the
bankrupt
of
his
tax
refund
check
would
work
in
equivalent
hardship
as
to
deprive
him
of
his
vacation
pay.
perhaps
the
more
so,
because
the
debtor
has
already
been
forced
to
accept
the
delayed
payment
of
these
wages,
which
he
needed.
in
any
event,
the
contention
of
the
bankrupt
in
this
case
is
that
the
tax
refund
check
is
as
important
a
part
of
the
family
budget,
as
vacation
pay.
now,
the
court
below,
the
second
circuit
did
not
apply
this
same
analysis
and
attempted
to
distinguish
lines
versus
frederick
in
this
regard,
by
claiming
that
vacation
pay
was
a
periodic
wage
payment,
like
a
person’s
regular
pay
check,
whereas
this
is
not.
that
court’s
distinction,
we
submit,
is
both
unrealistic
and
not
in
keeping
with
this
court’s
decision
in
the
lines
case.
it
is
unrealistic
because
a
debtor
needs
his
wages
for
support,
whether
they
are
paid
to
him
on
a
regular
basis
or
not,
they
are
just
as
important
for
his
fresh
start.
the
second
circuit’s
distinction
is
not
consistent
with
lines
versus
frederick,
because
in
lines
this
court
rejected
focusing
on
technical
distinctions,
such
as
whether
or
not
the
property
was
paid
in
a
periodic
way
or
not
and
focused
instead
on
a
broader
examination
and
the
practical
realities
to
the
bankrupt
and
the
relationship
of
the
asset
to
the
debtor’s
fresh
start.
another
important
case,
cited
by
the
court
below
was
segal
versus
rochelle.
that
brings
us
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
asset
is
in
some
way
entangled
in
the
debtor’s
prebankruptcy
past.
the
second
test,
which
this
court
has
emphasized,
a
bankrupt’s
position
in
this
case
is
that
segal
versus
rochelle
does
not
require
result
contrary
to
what
the
bankrupt
is
urging.
in
that
case,
we
dealt
with
the
business
bankrupt,
who
is
entitled
to
receive
a
loss
carry
back
refund.
as
this
court
noted
in
lines,
segal
really
wasn’t
a
fresh
start
case.
in
segal,
a
business
has
ceased
to
operate,
and
the
job
of
the
trustee
was
simply
to
marshal
the
assets
for
the
benefit
of
the
creditors.
also,
there
is
not
causal
link
to
the
prebankruptcy
past
in
this
case,
as
the
court
found
important
in
the
case
of
segal
versus
rochelle.
there,
the
court
noted
the
peculiar
nature
of
a
loss
carry
back
refund
check
and
found
that
it
was
the
result
of
those
very
losses,
which
had
precipitated
the
bankruptcy.
there
is
no
such
problem
here.
thus,
to
summarize
this
part
of
the
bankrupt’s
position,
we
contend
that
lines
requires
the
court
in
examining
the
definition
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
“property”
focus
on
practical
realities
and
to
analyze
the
relationship
of
the
asset
to
the
debtor’s
fresh
start.
lines
marked
the
rejection
of
more
mechanical
approach
to
defining
property,
by
focusing
on
whether
or
not
when
it
was
earned,
when
it
was
accrued,
whether
it
was
a
result
of
prebankruptcy
labor.
instead,
lines
focused
on
the
relationship
of
the
asset
to
the
debtor’s
fresh
start.
the
fact
that
it
was
not
an
investment
or
other
kind
of
voluntary
creation
that
it
was
a
postbankruptcy
event
and
that
it
was
inconsistent
entirely
of
wages,
which
traditionally
are
the
only
means
for
bankrupt
to
achieve
his
fresh
start.
thus
in
lines,
this
court
held
that
the
wages
represented
by
vacation
pay
were
essential
to
a
debtor’s
fresh
start.
seven
months
later,
in
perez
versus
campbell,
the
court
also
held
that
a
debtor
shouldn’t
be
deprived
of
his
driver’s
license
because
of
the
burden
that
that
would
place
on
his
earnings.
the
position
of
the
bankrupt
in
this
case
is
that
the
tax
refund
check,
being
wages,
the
loss
of
a
tax
refund
check
would
be
as
serious
of
a
burden
on
a
debtor’s
fresh
start,
as
the
loss
of
vacation
pay,
or
the
loss
of
a
driver’s
license.
the
second
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
federal
wage
exemption
statute,
the
consumer
credit
protection
act
exempts
75%
of
the
tax
refund
check.
the
court
need
not
reach
this
issue
if
it
rules
in
the
bankrupt’s
favor
on
the
first
question.
however,
we
contend
that
the
ccpa
should
apply
by
the
terms
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
by
terms
of
the
ccpa
for
an
independent
policy
reason
and
that
--
by
reference
to
administrative
materials.
first
the
bankruptcy
act,
many
exemption
statutes,
state
exemption
statutes
do
not
ever
refer
to
bankruptcy.
they
are
not
written
particularly
with
bankruptcy
in
mind,
but
they
apply
to
a
person
who
goes
bankrupt
because
the
bankruptcy
act
requires
that
they
apply.
it
specifically
stated
in
section
6
that
the
bankrupt
be
allowed
all
states
and
federal
exemptions.
the
ccpa,
being
a
partial,
federal
wage
exemption
statute
should
apply
to
bankruptcy
by
the
requirements
of
the
bankruptcy
act
in
section
6.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
essentially,
that’s
right
mr.
justice.
there
is
a
wage
exemption
statute
which
being
smaller
than
the
federal
statute
in
this
case
was
not
applied.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
to
be
honest,
i
am
not
sure.
there
is
a
federal
wage
exemption
--
or
i
mean
excuse
connecticut
wage
exemption
statute.
it
only
applies
to
consumer
credit,
garnishments
for
consumer
credits
so
i
--
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
i
don’t
think
it
would
apply,
but
that
would
be
a
question
interpretation
of
connecticut
law,
which
doesn’t
presently
exist.
in
any
event,
it
probably
only
protect
about
$65.00,
if
it
did
apply.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
there
would
a
number
of
problems
interpreting
the
connecticut
statute
to
get
it
to
apply.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
that’s
correct
your
honor,
that’s
correct.
for
example,
in
california,
which
is
known
for
having
liberal
exemption
statutes,
only
50%
of
the
earnings
attributable
to
the
last
30
days
would
be
exempt,
so
a
cash
refund
check
would
come
to
a
very
small
percentage.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
yes,
you
referred
to
it
specifically.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
was
it
two
to
one?
yes,
it
was
two
to
one,
that’s
right,
excuse
me
mr.
justice.
let
me
just
--
although
the
lines
issue
is
often
thought
to
be
the
main
issue
in
this
case
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
just
referred
to
it,
the
value
to
the
bankrupt
of
the
application
of
the
75%
federal
exemption
statute
is
an
important
right,
which
we
are
seriously
urging
before
this
court.
well,
i
was
saying
a
number
of
state
exemptions
statutes
apply
not
because
in
their
own
terms
they
refer
it
all
to
application
in
bankruptcy
or
because
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
in
the
ccpa,
we
have
a
slightly
different
statute.
it
should
apply
in
a
bankruptcy
context
not
only
on
account
of
bankruptcy
act,
but
on
account
of
its
own
terms.
congress
specifically
stated
that
the
ccpa
was
passed
in
order
to
achieve
the
uniform
application
of
the
bankruptcy
loss.
in
this
case,
a
uniform
wage
exemption
statute
rather
than
the
widely
varying
wage
exemption
statutes
which
apply
in
the
states.
most
of
the
criticism
in
the
ccpa,
both
by
the
court
below,
by
the
gehrig
court
and
by
opposing
counsel
has
been
an
attempt
to
narrow
the
meaning
and
the
terms
of
the
ccpa.
the
examination
of
that
statute
however
shows
that
it
is
a
broad
statute,
very
broadly
drafted
by
congress,
and
additionally
being
a
remedial
statute,
it
is
entitled
to
be
liberally
construed
in
favor
of
achieving
its
purposes.
thirdly,
there
is
a
policy
ground
for
the
application
of
the
ccpa.
this
was
noted
by
the
district
court
in
the
cedor
case,
involving
a
question
of
fairness
that
creditors,
the
exemption
should
not
be
defeated
and
creditors
should
not
be
allowed
to
get
the
entire
tax
refund
check
merely
because
the
debtor
has
been
forced
to
accept
the
delayed
receipt
of
that
money
due
to
the
operation
of
the
withholding
laws.
finally
in
this
regard,
there
are
number
of
administrative
materials,
which
are
cited
in
our
brief,
which
support
our
position,
our
interpretation
of
this
act
and
its
application
of
this
situation
and
those
administrative
materials
are
entitled
a
great
weight.
in
conclusion,
an
examination
of
the
relationship
of
this
asset
to
the
debtor’s
fresh
start
in
the
same
practical
way
this
court
made
that
analysis
in
lines
should
yield
a
result
that
a
wage
earner’s
postbankruptcy
receipt
of
his
tax
refund
check
is
not
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
as
far
as
the
federal
wage
exemption
statute
is
concerned,
it
should
apply
here
by
the
terms
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
it
should
apply
by
the
terms
of
the
ccpa
or
an
independent
policy
reason,
and
by
reference
to
supporting
administrative
materials.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
take
a
few
moments
to
discuss
some
brief
items
in
rebuttal.
first,
i
want
to
object
to
characterization
of
the
bankrupt’s
position
in
this
case
that
we’re
arguing
at
any
time
of
the
bankrupt
has
some
sort
of
needs
that
the
bankruptcy
act
letting
to
keep
some
property
or
that
we’re
arguing
that
all
property
derived
from
wages
is
somehow
not
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
now,
it’s
true
that
there
is
a
material
in
our
brief
on
the
needs
to
the
bankrupt
here,
but
that
material
is
there
to
emphasize
an
important
point.
and
as
this
court
found
in
lines
versus
frederick,
wages
are
special
kind
of
asset
in
our
system.
the
material
on
mr.
kokoszka’s
situation
and
material
on
his
needs
are
there
to
show
the
importance
of
wages.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
well,
that’s
a
similar
example
as
was
dealt
with
by
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
vinnie
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
i
think
the
federal
law,
as
far
as
the
exemption
statute
is
concerned,
the
federal
law
protects
wages
whether
they’re
paid
or
yet
payable.
so,
if
the
wages
held
by
the
employer
are
already
been
paid,
they
would
be
exempt
if
the
employer
was
holding
in
account
of
wages
due,
so
that
wages
were
payable
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
well,
i
was
--
excuse
me
i
was
getting
to
that
point,
i
thought
you’d
move
on
to
the
exemption
statute
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
well,
conceptually
that’s
true.
i
think
the
problem
--
i
would
argue
mr.
justice
white,
that
they
would
not
be
property
under
the
bankruptcy.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
and,
i
think
that
the
same
reasons
would
apply.
it
was
involuntarily
created
asset,
it’s
derived
entirely
from
wages
and
it’s
received
entirely
as
a
postbankruptcy
event.
in
many
ways
--
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
i
would
like
to
point,
you
mean
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
i’d
like
to
say
it
wasn’t
my
proposition,
[laughter
attempt]
because
it’s
a
very
hard
example,
but
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
what
i
would
say
to
that
point
is
that
the
bankrupt
in
that
situation,
i
mean,
i
wouldn’t
be
interested
in
the
examination
of
additional
facts.
i
think
you
can
see
that,
that
is
in
a
very
exceptional
circumstance,
but
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
under
the
straight
analysis
--
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
i
think
in
my
experience,
as
a
bankruptcy
attorney,
i’ve
never
seen
that
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
that’s
correct.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
i
think
the
only
real
difference
your
case,
mr.
justice
white,
and
the
case
of
bar
is
that
you’ve
just
given
me
an
example,
where
there’s
potentially
a
very
large
amount
of
money
involved,
whereas
typically
we
have
a
very
small
amount
of
money
involved
in
a
tax
refund
case.
now,
i
don’t
think
that’s
a
distinction.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
well,
let
me
get
to
my
point,
mr.
justice
white
and
that
is
i
think
that
the
situation
in
the
example
that
you
have
given
is
one
where
we
have
--
you’re
talking
about
a
fund
of
wages,
which
would
have
never
been
available
in
a
practical
sense
for
the
creditors
if
they
didn’t
paid
out
--
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
well
--
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
the
wages,
i
want
to
speak
in
terms
of
a
practical
matter
here,
wages
are
75%
exempt
at
least,
according
to
the
federal
stature,
in
order
for
the
creditors
to
obtain
those
wages,
there
are
number
of
state
law,
procedural
safeguards,
as
well
as
federal
constitutional
safeguards.
now,
this
fund
has
been
created,
which
has
only
increased
the
incredible
hardships
on
the
bankrupt.
now,
i
think
that
although
what
we’re
talking
about
in
your
case
is
a
substantial
fund
of
money
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
bankrupt,
it
was
also
a
substantial
loss,
a
deprivation
of
wages,
which
he
needed
for
his
support
in
the
past.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
threw
him
in
a
bankruptcy.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
no,
i
--
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
agree
entirely
on
that
point.
i
was
stating
that
although
i
felt
the
only
distinction
between
our
case
and
mr.
justice
white’s
example
was
the
size.
i
don’t
think
that
is
a
valid
way
to
distinguish
the
assets
within
the
meaning
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
although
i
would
note
that
if
the
court
is
concerned
about
the
line
drawing
problem
in
this
case,
which
is
really
only
presented
in
my
view
by
exceptional
circumstances,
another
alternative
is
to
apply
the
federal
wage
exemption
statute
to
the
tax
refund
check,
which
clearly
does
draw
lines
such
established
by
congress.
i
would
like
to
go
on
and
discuss
the
problem
of
abandonment.
the
second
circuit
suggested
that
abandonment
was
an
alternative.
i
don’t
think
in
the
first
place
it's
a
practical
alternative.
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
schedules,
the
referee
is
not
going
to
know,
especially
if
a
tax
refund
check
hasn’t
been
received
yet
or
returned,
hasn’t
even
been
filed,
whether
or
not
they
are
going
to
be
any
assets
in
the
estate.
once
he
appoints
a
trustee,
he
is
going
to
feel
that
he’s
going
to
have
to
pay
that
trustee,
whether
or
not
any
of
the
assets
are
going
to
passed
on
to
the
creditors.
secondly,
it's
gong
to
resolve
to
non-uniform
application
of
the
bankruptcy
laws,
the
material
in
our
brief,
the
stanley
and
girth
material
supports
that.
thirdly,just
as
a
practical
matter
abandonment
is
never
used
or
used
very
rarely
in
the
administration
of
the
bankruptcy
courts.
since,
that
is
supported
also
by
the
stanley
and
girth
survey,
since
the
kokoszka
opinion,
we
have
done
a
survey
of
our
own,
which
i
can
submit
to
the
court
with
its
permission
in
a
form
of
an
affidavit
from
one
of
the
attorneys
in
this
case,
demonstrating
that
in
the
second
circuit
since
the
kokoszka’s
opinion,
there
haven’t
been
any
abandonments
pursuant
to
that
opinion.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
well,
although
that’s
an
alternative
that
is
recognized
by
the
--
it’s
never
done,
it’s
never
done.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
in
very
rare
cases.
the
reason
being
that
the
referees
don’t
know
whether
or
not
to
believe
in
the
material,
on
the
schedules
or
not
and
they
want
to
point
someone
to
look
into
it
(voice
overlapping)
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
right,
to
look
into
this
situation
and
once
they
do,
then
you’re
caught
up
in
a
circle
again.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
[laughter]
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
no,
it’s
a
trustee
is
appointed
in
california
in
virtually
every
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
similarly,
in
connecticut,
where
mr.
kokoszka
come
--
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
there
are
court
rules,
as
to
a
$115.00
tax
refund
check
was
established
in
some
districts
in
southern
california.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
well,
i
don’t
know
mr.
justice
stewart
as
to
whether
or
not
fees
and
so
on
had
to
come
from
some
other
area
in
the
application
of
that
rule,
but
i
know
that
as
a
practical
matter,
that
referees
feel
that
they
don’t
--
they
can't
believe
the
bankrupt
necessarily
may
want
to
appoint
a
trustee
to
see
if
there
were
other
assets,
savings
account,
that
sort
of
thing.
finally,
i
just
like
to
say
that
as
to
the
gehrig
court’s
analysis
of
the
ccpa
issue,
they
were
dealing
only
with
an
analysis
of
the
voluntary
aspects
of
the
tax
refund
check
that
had
been
created
due
to
over
withholding.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
r.
adams
i
welcome
the
privilege.
