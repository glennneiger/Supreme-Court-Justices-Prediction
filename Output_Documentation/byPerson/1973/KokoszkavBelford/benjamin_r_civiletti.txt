mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
tax
refund
claim,
which
at
the
time
of
the
petition
in
bankruptcy
was
fixed
and
certain
as
to
amount
and
demandable
and
collectible.
the
argument
made
by
the
petitioner
is
that
a
wage
earner’s
bankrupt’s
tax
refund
claim
is
not
property
because
it
is
necessary
to
his
fresh
start,
i
think
runs
counter
to
the
meaning
and
the
purpose
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
its
historical
development
and
interpretation,
and
specifically
conflicts
with
the
pertinent
parts
of
the
definitional
sections
of
the
act,
under
section
70a
(5)
and
under
section
6
of
exemptions.
furthermore,
the
petitioner’s
argument
misinterprets,
i
believe,
the
concept
of
a
fresh
start
and
the
rationale
of
the
petitioner’s
position
would
impose
substantial
confusion
and
uncertainty
in
the
bankruptcy
law.
first,
the
scheme
of
the
bankruptcy
law
generally
is
in
two
parts.
first,
marshaling
the
assets
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
petition,
all
the
property
of
the
bankrupt
vest
by
operable
with
certain
exceptions,
which
is
not
nonexempt,
vest
by
operation
of
law
in
the
trustee.
the
second
part
of
that
scheme
is
section
6,
the
exemption
part,
which
provides
specifically
that
local
conditions
shall
govern
local
statutes,
which
assets
maybe
maintained
by
the
particular
bankrupt
in
order
to
assure
that
he
can
survive
and
so
that
he
can
have
at
least
those
basic
essential
requirements
in
which
he
can
then
cause
to
begin
his
new
life.
the
concept
of
a
fresh
start
incorporates
both
those
ideas
of
assets
to
the
trustee
and
exemptions
to
the
bankrupt
and
also,
and
most
importantly
the
idea
provided
by
section
17
of
a
discharge,
an
effective
valuable
discharge
to
the
bankrupt,
so
that
he
can
begin
his
new
economic
life,
free
of
the
burden
of
these
preexisting
debts.
so
that
the
three
elements,
i
suggest
for
a
fresh
start,
are:
(1)
the
proper
discharge;
(2)
specified
assets
or
items
of
value,
which
provide
a
base
and
an
opportunity
to
start
anew,
provided
by
exemptions;
and
(3)
the
opportunity
and
the
safeguard
that
future
earnings
and
after
acquired
property
can
be
used,
retained,
and
accumulated
by
the
bankrupt
in
his
new
economic
effort.
the
petitioner
twists
and
distorts
the
traditional
concept
of
fresh
start
into
the
overriding
proposition
that
the
bankruptcy
law
must
provide,
it
seems
to
me,
a
protected
fund
sufficient
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
bankrupt.
the
primary
support
suggested
by
the
petitioner
in
his
argument
and
his
brief,
is
the
case
of
lines
v.
frederick
decided
in
1970.
there
in
essence,
the
question
was
presented
whether
the
credits
are
accrued
or
pay
accrued
during
prebankruptcy
work
for
vacation
and
layoff
time
periods
to
come
about
in
the
future,
after
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
petition
in
bankruptcy,
were
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
this
court
determined
that
whatever
characteristics
of
property
for
other
purposes
that
those
credits
are
accrued
pay
might
have
or
possessed,
they
were
overshadowed
in
comparison
to
their
similarity,
the
future
earnings
and
the
purposes
of
the
act,
as
embodied
in
the
term
“fresh
start.”
the
similarities
of
the
accruals
to
future
wages
were
one
the
fact
that
the
accrued
credits
or
pay
were
not
payable
and
collectible
on
demand
by
the
petitioner
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
his
petition
at
all,
but
would
ordinarily
be
payable
at
the
future
event,
vacation
or
layoff.
in
fact,
the
accrued
pay
or
credits
were
designed
and
specifically
tied
to
one
of
the
other
of
those
two
events
as
a
substitute
payment
for
future
period
of
time,
which
but
for
vacation
or
layoff
would
be
working
time
and
which
the
bankrupt
would
receive
the
very
weekly
earnings,
which
would
be
cause
to
sustain
him.
the
only
relation
back
at
all
of
the
accrued
credits
or
the
pay,
the
vacation
pay
to
the
prebankruptcy
past
was
at
the
prior
regular
working
period
was
the
basis
for
accumulating
the
accrual
on
a
percentage
formula,
as
to
hours
or
days
and
it’s
equivalent
in
money.
i
believe
it
was
one
hour
per
month
or
one
hour
per
week.
it
is
readily
apparent
that
here,
if
the
facts
are
entirely
different
from
those
crucial
determinations
there
which
made
accrued
vacation
pay
look
like
and
be
treated
the
same
as
future
wages,
which
indeed
are
protected
and
should
be
protected
both
by
the
discharge
and
by
the
concept
of
fresh
start.
one,
the
tax
refund
claim
here
is
fixed
and
certain
as
to
amount,
demandable
and
collectible.
two,
there
is
no
design,
no
specification
or
intent
to
relate
or
identify
the
accumulation
of
periodic
payments,
required
as
withholding
for
expected
tax
liability
and
which
constitutes
a
reason
for
the
refund
claim
to
any
period
of
future
working
time
or
as
a
substitute
for
regular
earnings
as
sustenance
to
the
wage
earner
in
the
event
of
future
loss
time
for
layoff,
vacation
leaves,
sick
leave,
or
any
other
reason.
the
tax
refund
claim
is
simply
not
the
equivalent
to
future
wages
or
a
substitute
for
future
wages
during
the
suspended
working
period
in
the
future.
lastly,
it
seems
to
me
that
all
the
characteristics
of
the
tax
refund
claim
relate
back
to
the
prebankruptcy
past,
during
the
very
accumulation
of
debt,
which
resulted
in
the
filing
of
the
petition
of
bankruptcy.
in
this
regard,
i
think
it
is
speculation
to
suggest,
as
perhaps
the
eighth
and
ninth
circuits
have
suggested,
in
the
case
of
in
re
gehrig
and
in
re
cedor
that
the
wage
earner
would
not
have
used
the
amounts
periodically
withheld
for
the
payments
of
debts.
certainly,
they
are
small
amounts
and
they
would
not
have
made
a
tremendous
impact
on
the
debts
at
the
time
of
proceeding,
but
it
is
certain
and
probable
that
they
would
have
been
spent
and
they
would
have
been
spent
either
to
reduce
in
part
the
debts
or
prevent
the
further
accumulation
of
debt
for
expenses
incurred
at
the
time.
and
thus,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
relate
to
the
very
part
of
the
period,
which
created
the
debt
and
necessitated
bankruptcy.
the
further
argument
is
made
by
the
ninth
circuit’s
adoption
of
this
recorded
opinion,
in
an
effort
to
bring
the
tax
refund
closer
within
the
lines
the
frederick
case
that
the
amount
of
a
tax
refund
may
be
generally
be
said
to
be
an
amount
that
by
reason
of
past
experience
is
anticipated
by
the
wage
earner
as
an
annual
event,
i.e.
the
vacation
pay
and
the
potential
layoff,
and
that
to
deprive
the
wage
earner
of
that
planned
on
annual
recurring
payment
cannot
be
said
to
be
less
severe
than
the
deprivation
of
two
weeks
paid
vacation.
it
seems
to
me
that
statement,
that
type
of
analogy,
not
only
being
somewhat
illogical
is
a
further
distinction
between
the
tax
refund
claim
and
accrued
vacation
pay
or
credit
because
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
and
if
the
taxpayer
follows
the
withholding
guidelines
properly,
although
vacation
pay
is
indeed
paid
and
received
in
the
future
by
a
wage
earner
as
an
annual
event,
the
minimum
payment
of
income
on
taxes
withheld
periodically
during
the
year
and
accumulated
over
the
course
of
the
year
is
not
calculated,
nor
anticipated
to
be
repaid
as
an
annual
event
to
the
taxpayer,
rather
its
intended,
designed,
and
anticipated
to
be
paid
and
retained
by
the
government,
as
the
wage
earner’s
income
tax
on
those
earnings.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
fact
to
its
essence,
the
petitioner’s
argument
is
that
because
the
tax
refund
claim
had
has
its
origins
in
withheld
payments
from
wages,
the
refund
is
wages
and
because
the
debtor
has
not
collected
the
refund
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
petition,
although
he
had
right
to
do
so,
it
is
somehow
future
wages.
the
petitioner’s
argument
amounts
to
ignoring
the
definition
of
property
in
section
70a
(5),
ignoring
the
definition
and
design
of
exemptions,
i
think
ignoring
the
traditional
concept
of
“fresh
start”
and
the
entire
fabric
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
in
adopting
a
new
and
controlling
rationale
for
inclusion
or
exclusion
of
items
of
value
in
the
debtor’s
estate.
and
to
base
that
decision
entirely
in
a
wage
earner’s
case
on
a
determination
of
the
amount
of
a
fund,
free
of
creditors
and
necessary
are
sufficient
to
meet
the
bankrupt’s
needs.
i
don’t
think
that
this
rationale
has
any
place
in
this
court’s
decision
on
the
existing
and
statutory
case
law.
if
there
is
to
be
such
a
change
and
such
a
drastic
one,
then
certainly
the
legislature
and
the
congress
should
mandate
it.
and,
in
fact
the
commission
on
the
bankruptcy
laws
of
the
united
states
has
reported
to
the
congress,
as
of
july
30,
1973
proposing
substantial
revisions
in
the
bankruptcy
law
and
proposing
that
as
to
this
particular
issue,
under
a
provision
with
regard
to
exemptions
that
income
tax
refunds,
accrued
vacation
pay,
receivables,
cash
and
securities
be
considered
to
be
exempt
in
the
aggregate
of
not
more
than
$500.00.
but
the
standard
proposed
by
the
petitioner
is
unsound
and
its
application
would
result,
it
seems
to
me,
in
severe
discrimination
between
bankrupts.
one
bankrupt
may
indeed
need
$75.00
for
medical
treatment.
the
second
$500.00
for
his
wife’s
operation,
and
the
third
$2,000.00
for
the
tuition
for
his
children’s
education,
all
certainly
are
legitimate
and
valid
needs.
but
in
no
sense
can
it
be
said
that
such
a
standard
would
achieve
the
purposes
of
the
act
nor
that
the
tax
refund
claim
in
varying
amounts,
which
in
some
instances
may
amount
to
in
excess
of
a
$1,000.00
would
serve
these
varying
purposes
or
needs.
there
is
a
suggestion
in
the
brief
that
because
the
amount
of
a
tax
refund
in
this
case
is
small,
and
because
administration
costs
and
expenses
are
significant
in
some
instances
that
very
little
of
this
amount
of
money
will
trickle
down
to
the
creditors
and
therefore,
wouldn’t
it
be
better
to
give
it
to
the
needy
bankrupt.
the
answer
to
that,
i
think
comes
in
different
ways.
one,
administration
costs
and
expenses
are
not
necessarily
evil.
they
are
in
the
act
and
they
are
in
fact,
under
section
64,
given
first
priority
with
regard
to
payments
from
the
assets
accumulated.
secondly,
there
is
no
support
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
the
$250.90
would
be
exhausted
by
administrative
costs
and
expenses.
and
in
other
cases
where
the
refund
may
be
substantially
greater,
there
is
no
suggestion
that
such
administrative
costs
and
expenses
will
even
substantially
beat
it
into
the
assets.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
if
you
would
follow
the
argument
of
the
petition
--
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
i
think
that
is
correct,
especially
in
a
wage
earner’s
case,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
in
one
route
or
another,
one
either
direct
or
indirect
all
of
the
property
or
all
assets
are
derived
from
his
only
source,
which
is
wages.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
that’s
true.
i
think
the
brookings
study
showed
that
in
70%
of
the
cases,
there
were
no
asset
cases
at
all.
third,
if
as
the
petitioner
points
out
on
page
16
of
his
brief,
a
survey
indicates
that
the
average
dividend
to
unsecured
creditors
is
only
7%,
then
that
alone
does
not
seem
to
me
a
justification
to
further
reduce
the
percentage
on
one
of
the
basic
designs
of
the
act
to
return
money
to
the
creditors,
from
7%
closer
to
zero.
fourthly,
and
perhaps
most
importantly
and
i
think
it
occurs
in
varying
degrees,
in
varying
in
districts
and
jurisdictions,
abandonment
is
available,
where
appropriate
in
such
small
asset
cases.
i
think
the
california
cases
suggest
that
some
of
the
referees
there
and
the
district
courts
there
have
adopted
the
policy
of
--
if
the
refund
claim
is
the
only
asset
and
it’s
less
than
$150.00,
that
they
would
treat
it
as
abandonment,
as
a
no
asset
case
and
no
trustee
would
be
appointed
and
the
$10.00
will
be
even
saved
in
the
cost
of
the
bankrupt.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
yes,
indeed
it
does,
at
least
that
is
my
understanding
from
review
of
the
cases
and
the
record.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
it
purports
to,
yes.
(voice
overlap)
whether
or
not
it’s
a
proper
exercise
of
the
discretion
or
as
views
in
those
instances,
where
for
instance
the
amount
of
the
tax
refund
claim
might
be
several
$700.00
or
$800.00,
or
$1,500.00,
i
believe
in
the
cedor
case,
the
amount
was
about
$660.00.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
the
trustee
has
the
discretion
to
abandon
if
authorized
by
the
referee.
the
referee
would
have
to
authorize
the
abandonment,
and
then
the
trustee,
i
believe,
would
do
so
without
that
authorization.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
no.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
the
abandonment
provision?
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
that’s
true.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
well,
there
is
a
decision.
there
are
two
decisions
mr.
justice
white.
one
is
if
the
referee
finds
that
there
is
only
for
instance
a
tax
refund
which
looks
to
be
$150.00,
he
can
at
that
point
determine
that,
that
asset
should
abandon
the
referee
and
not
appoint
a
trustee
and
treat
it
as
a
non-asset
case.
the
second
situation
is
where
the
same
--
let
us
take
the
same
a
$150.00
tax
refund
claim
and
perhaps
some
uncertainty
as
to
other
assets
and
then
a
trustee
is
appointed.
then,
a
second
decision
would
seem
to
me
to
have
to
be
made
by
the
trustee
initially,
as
to
whether
to
pursue
the
tax
refund
claim
if
he
determined
there
were
no
other
further
assets,
and
then
have
the
authorization
receive
for
such
abandonment
by
or
from
the
referee.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
in
the
second
circuit
case
in
our
case,
suggested
that
if
the
needs
of
the
bankrupt
were
great
enough
that
a
deprivation
of
the
amount
of
the
tax
refund
claim,
$150.00,
$200.00,
$300.00
would
amount
to
a
substantial
inequity,
a
severe
hardship
or
harshness,
then
it
could
reasonably
conclude
that
abandonment
was
proper.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
yes,
that
was
another
reason,
i
believe,
stated
or
expressed
in
a
few
sentences
why
the
court
suggested
that
either
the
appointment
of
a
trustee
was
unnecessary
or
if
one
had
been
appointed
then,
a
very
quick
determination
that
then
it
was
proper.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
i
am
not
certain
of
that,
of
agreement
with
that
statement.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
white,
i
misspoke
myself
in
answer
to
a
question
that
you
addressed
to
me
prior
to
the
noon
recess
with
regard
to
abandonment
in
the
second
circuit’s
opinion
and
direction
to
the
lower
courts
in
kokoszka.
there,
they
restricted
the
application
of
abandonment
to
the
situation
wherein
the
assets
available
to
the
trustee
would
be
entirely
consumed
by
the
trustee’s
fee
and
other
administrative
expenses.
and,
there
was
no
creditor
who
showed
other
available
assets,
which
could
be
reached
and
judge
webster
in
the
dissent
in
gehrig
took
the
same
position,
so
that
my
--
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
i
would
think
that
is
a
fair
conclusion.
my
argument
has
proceeded
along
the
lines
that
there
is
no
legitimate
distinction
between
the
principles
applicable
to
this
case
and
those
past
cases
concerning
properties,
segal
v.
rochelle
and
the
antecedent
cases,
legg
v.
st.
john
and
in
mind,
the
concept
of
“fresh
start”
local
loan
v.
hunt.
the
segal
case,
i
suggest
was
a
more
difficult
case
than
the
one
presented
here
because
the
petitioners
had
filed
for
bankruptcy
before
the
end
of
the
tax
year,
and
thus
any
refund
was
demandable
nor
collectible
immediately
nor
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
petition
in
bankruptcy,
nor
was
the
amount
there
of
fixed,
nor
truly
determinable
with
the
exact
certainty.
furthermore,
the
carry
back
tax
loss
resulted
in
a
tax
refund,
which
the
trustee
was
found
entitled
to
receive.
even
though
the
tax
was
paid,
it
had
been
paid
from
the
individual
earnings
of
the
bankrupt
taxpayers.
there
was
no
suggestion
in
that
case,
in
the
opinion
in
that
case
by
this
court
that
the
amounts
in
segal
respectively
of
$283.00
and
$1,600.00
for
gerald
segal
in
the
carry
back
years
of
1960
and
1959
and
like
amounts
for
sam
segal
could
not
have
been
well
used
by
them
in
obtaining
the
necessary
fresh
start
in
their
new
economic
life.
the
court
took,
i
suggest,
pains
to
emphasize
the
lost
carry
back
claim
there
was
sufficiently
rooted
in
the
prebankruptcy
past
and
so
little
entangle
with
the
bankruptcy
to
make
unencumbered
fresh
start
that
it
should
be
regarded
as
the
property
under
section
70
(a)
(5),
despite
the
substantial
differences,
which
i
suggest
make
this
case
considerably
easier
in
determination
of
the
question
of
property.
the
tax
refund
claim
is
fixed
and
certain
as
to
amount
demandable
and
collectible
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
petition
and
i
suggest
has
no
relationship
to
future
wages
nor
after
acquired
property,
both
of
which
elements
were
certainly
controlling
in
the
lines
case
and
had
some
effect
in
the
segal
case.
a
decision
upholding
the
second
circuit
and
the
trustee
would
not
only
be
consistent
with
lines
v.
frederick,
but
would
further
serve
to
confirm
the
plain
meaning
and
intent
of
the
principles
recognized
so
clearly
in
the
case,
future
wages
and
after
acquired
property
are
necessary,
essential
elements
of
the
concept
of
a
fresh
start.
there
is
no
legitimate
distinction,
i
suggest
between
a
tax
refund
claim
and
any
other
moneys
or
funds
obtained
by
payroll
withholding
from
past
wages
pursuant
to
a
savings
plan,
a
christmas
club,
a
bond
the
month
plan,
a
retail
lay
away
plan,
an
educational
loan
repayment
plan,
or
agreement,
union
dues,
auto
insurance,
real
estate
tax
or
any
other
established
payroll
deduction,
which
could
result
in
a
refund
or
repayment
from
a
second
or
third
source.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
well,
the
term
voluntary,
i
think
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
that
they
would
argue
that
that
is
a
distinction.
i
suggest
that
number
one,
the
meaning
of
voluntary
varies,
depending
on
its
application
and
that
pursuant
to
a
loan
agreement
for
instance,
once
the
decision
is
made,
then
that
payment
or
deduction
from
payroll
might
well
no
longer
be
considered
to
be
voluntary.
similarly
here,
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
pointed
out,
the
voluntariness
to
some
extent
is
available
to
the
taxpayer
in
the
manner
in
which
he
proscribes
his
withholding
and
it
is
adjustable
during
the
course
of
the
year,
depending
on
changes
and
circumstances
by
him.
turning
to
the
consumer
credit
protection
act,
my
argument
there
is
a
very
short
and
brief
one.
it
is
not
applicable,
because
the
tax
refund
claim
here
does
not
come
within
the
definitional
term
of
earnings
in
that
act.
it
is
not
compensation
paid
or
payable
for
past
services.
it
does
not
come
within
the
definition
of
the
term
disposable
earnings,
because
it
is
not
that
part
of
earnings
remaining
after
deductions
allowed
by
law.
and
lastly,
it
is
not
within
the
term
the
definition
of
garnishment,
which
in
the
language
of
the
statute
means
any
legal
or
equitable
procedure
through
which
the
earnings
of
any
individual
are
required
to
be
withheld
for
the
payment
of
any
debt.
here,
if
this
is
property
then
it
vests
in
the
trustee
by
operation
of
law
and
it
is
not
required
to
be
withheld
for
the
payment
of
any
debt
pursuant
for
instance,
to
provisions
of
seizure
or
collection
under
section
70
(c)
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
reference
in
the
consumer
credit
protection
act,
specific
reference
in
that
act,
chapter
13
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
saying
that
the
provisions
of
the
consumer
credit
protection
act
do
not
apply
to
chapter
13
arrangements
was
made
because
chapter
13
arrangements
do
apply
to
future
wages,
do
specifically
provide
for
the
deduction
for
the
payment
to
creditors
for
past
debts,
pursuant
to
the
plan
approved
by
the
referee,
and
therefore,
was
necessary
in
order
to
make
clear
that
the
25%
limitation
would
not
apply
to
such
arrangements
that
chapter
13
should
be
specifically
referred
in
the
consumer
credit
protection
act.
thank
you.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
tax
refund
claim,
which
at
the
time
of
the
petition
in
bankruptcy
was
fixed
and
certain
as
to
amount
and
demandable
and
collectible.
the
argument
made
by
the
petitioner
is
that
a
wage
earner’s
bankrupt’s
tax
refund
claim
is
not
property
because
it
is
necessary
to
his
fresh
start,
i
think
runs
counter
to
the
meaning
and
the
purpose
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
its
historical
development
and
interpretation,
and
specifically
conflicts
with
the
pertinent
parts
of
the
definitional
sections
of
the
act,
under
section
70a
(5)
and
under
section
6
of
exemptions.
furthermore,
the
petitioner’s
argument
misinterprets,
i
believe,
the
concept
of
a
fresh
start
and
the
rationale
of
the
petitioner’s
position
would
impose
substantial
confusion
and
uncertainty
in
the
bankruptcy
law.
first,
the
scheme
of
the
bankruptcy
law
generally
is
in
two
parts.
first,
marshaling
the
assets
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
petition,
all
the
property
of
the
bankrupt
vest
by
operable
with
certain
exceptions,
which
is
not
nonexempt,
vest
by
operation
of
law
in
the
trustee.
the
second
part
of
that
scheme
is
section
6,
the
exemption
part,
which
provides
specifically
that
local
conditions
shall
govern
local
statutes,
which
assets
maybe
maintained
by
the
particular
bankrupt
in
order
to
assure
that
he
can
survive
and
so
that
he
can
have
at
least
those
basic
essential
requirements
in
which
he
can
then
cause
to
begin
his
new
life.
the
concept
of
a
fresh
start
incorporates
both
those
ideas
of
assets
to
the
trustee
and
exemptions
to
the
bankrupt
and
also,
and
most
importantly
the
idea
provided
by
section
17
of
a
discharge,
an
effective
valuable
discharge
to
the
bankrupt,
so
that
he
can
begin
his
new
economic
life,
free
of
the
burden
of
these
preexisting
debts.
so
that
the
three
elements,
i
suggest
for
a
fresh
start,
are:
(1)
the
proper
discharge;
(2)
specified
assets
or
items
of
value,
which
provide
a
base
and
an
opportunity
to
start
anew,
provided
by
exemptions;
and
(3)
the
opportunity
and
the
safeguard
that
future
earnings
and
after
acquired
property
can
be
used,
retained,
and
accumulated
by
the
bankrupt
in
his
new
economic
effort.
the
petitioner
twists
and
distorts
the
traditional
concept
of
fresh
start
into
the
overriding
proposition
that
the
bankruptcy
law
must
provide,
it
seems
to
me,
a
protected
fund
sufficient
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
bankrupt.
the
primary
support
suggested
by
the
petitioner
in
his
argument
and
his
brief,
is
the
case
of
lines
v.
frederick
decided
in
1970.
there
in
essence,
the
question
was
presented
whether
the
credits
are
accrued
or
pay
accrued
during
prebankruptcy
work
for
vacation
and
layoff
time
periods
to
come
about
in
the
future,
after
the
date
of
the
filing
of
the
petition
in
bankruptcy,
were
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
this
court
determined
that
whatever
characteristics
of
property
for
other
purposes
that
those
credits
are
accrued
pay
might
have
or
possessed,
they
were
overshadowed
in
comparison
to
their
similarity,
the
future
earnings
and
the
purposes
of
the
act,
as
embodied
in
the
term
“fresh
start.”
the
similarities
of
the
accruals
to
future
wages
were
one
the
fact
that
the
accrued
credits
or
pay
were
not
payable
and
collectible
on
demand
by
the
petitioner
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
his
petition
at
all,
but
would
ordinarily
be
payable
at
the
future
event,
vacation
or
layoff.
in
fact,
the
accrued
pay
or
credits
were
designed
and
specifically
tied
to
one
of
the
other
of
those
two
events
as
a
substitute
payment
for
future
period
of
time,
which
but
for
vacation
or
layoff
would
be
working
time
and
which
the
bankrupt
would
receive
the
very
weekly
earnings,
which
would
be
cause
to
sustain
him.
the
only
relation
back
at
all
of
the
accrued
credits
or
the
pay,
the
vacation
pay
to
the
prebankruptcy
past
was
at
the
prior
regular
working
period
was
the
basis
for
accumulating
the
accrual
on
a
percentage
formula,
as
to
hours
or
days
and
it’s
equivalent
in
money.
i
believe
it
was
one
hour
per
month
or
one
hour
per
week.
it
is
readily
apparent
that
here,
if
the
facts
are
entirely
different
from
those
crucial
determinations
there
which
made
accrued
vacation
pay
look
like
and
be
treated
the
same
as
future
wages,
which
indeed
are
protected
and
should
be
protected
both
by
the
discharge
and
by
the
concept
of
fresh
start.
one,
the
tax
refund
claim
here
is
fixed
and
certain
as
to
amount,
demandable
and
collectible.
two,
there
is
no
design,
no
specification
or
intent
to
relate
or
identify
the
accumulation
of
periodic
payments,
required
as
withholding
for
expected
tax
liability
and
which
constitutes
a
reason
for
the
refund
claim
to
any
period
of
future
working
time
or
as
a
substitute
for
regular
earnings
as
sustenance
to
the
wage
earner
in
the
event
of
future
loss
time
for
layoff,
vacation
leaves,
sick
leave,
or
any
other
reason.
the
tax
refund
claim
is
simply
not
the
equivalent
to
future
wages
or
a
substitute
for
future
wages
during
the
suspended
working
period
in
the
future.
lastly,
it
seems
to
me
that
all
the
characteristics
of
the
tax
refund
claim
relate
back
to
the
prebankruptcy
past,
during
the
very
accumulation
of
debt,
which
resulted
in
the
filing
of
the
petition
of
bankruptcy.
in
this
regard,
i
think
it
is
speculation
to
suggest,
as
perhaps
the
eighth
and
ninth
circuits
have
suggested,
in
the
case
of
in
re
gehrig
and
in
re
cedor
that
the
wage
earner
would
not
have
used
the
amounts
periodically
withheld
for
the
payments
of
debts.
certainly,
they
are
small
amounts
and
they
would
not
have
made
a
tremendous
impact
on
the
debts
at
the
time
of
proceeding,
but
it
is
certain
and
probable
that
they
would
have
been
spent
and
they
would
have
been
spent
either
to
reduce
in
part
the
debts
or
prevent
the
further
accumulation
of
debt
for
expenses
incurred
at
the
time.
and
thus,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
relate
to
the
very
part
of
the
period,
which
created
the
debt
and
necessitated
bankruptcy.
the
further
argument
is
made
by
the
ninth
circuit’s
adoption
of
this
recorded
opinion,
in
an
effort
to
bring
the
tax
refund
closer
within
the
lines
the
frederick
case
that
the
amount
of
a
tax
refund
may
be
generally
be
said
to
be
an
amount
that
by
reason
of
past
experience
is
anticipated
by
the
wage
earner
as
an
annual
event,
i.e.
the
vacation
pay
and
the
potential
layoff,
and
that
to
deprive
the
wage
earner
of
that
planned
on
annual
recurring
payment
cannot
be
said
to
be
less
severe
than
the
deprivation
of
two
weeks
paid
vacation.
it
seems
to
me
that
statement,
that
type
of
analogy,
not
only
being
somewhat
illogical
is
a
further
distinction
between
the
tax
refund
claim
and
accrued
vacation
pay
or
credit
because
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events
and
if
the
taxpayer
follows
the
withholding
guidelines
properly,
although
vacation
pay
is
indeed
paid
and
received
in
the
future
by
a
wage
earner
as
an
annual
event,
the
minimum
payment
of
income
on
taxes
withheld
periodically
during
the
year
and
accumulated
over
the
course
of
the
year
is
not
calculated,
nor
anticipated
to
be
repaid
as
an
annual
event
to
the
taxpayer,
rather
its
intended,
designed,
and
anticipated
to
be
paid
and
retained
by
the
government,
as
the
wage
earner’s
income
tax
on
those
earnings.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
fact
to
its
essence,
the
petitioner’s
argument
is
that
because
the
tax
refund
claim
had
has
its
origins
in
withheld
payments
from
wages,
the
refund
is
wages
and
because
the
debtor
has
not
collected
the
refund
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
petition,
although
he
had
right
to
do
so,
it
is
somehow
future
wages.
the
petitioner’s
argument
amounts
to
ignoring
the
definition
of
property
in
section
70a
(5),
ignoring
the
definition
and
design
of
exemptions,
i
think
ignoring
the
traditional
concept
of
“fresh
start”
and
the
entire
fabric
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
in
adopting
a
new
and
controlling
rationale
for
inclusion
or
exclusion
of
items
of
value
in
the
debtor’s
estate.
and
to
base
that
decision
entirely
in
a
wage
earner’s
case
on
a
determination
of
the
amount
of
a
fund,
free
of
creditors
and
necessary
are
sufficient
to
meet
the
bankrupt’s
needs.
i
don’t
think
that
this
rationale
has
any
place
in
this
court’s
decision
on
the
existing
and
statutory
case
law.
if
there
is
to
be
such
a
change
and
such
a
drastic
one,
then
certainly
the
legislature
and
the
congress
should
mandate
it.
and,
in
fact
the
commission
on
the
bankruptcy
laws
of
the
united
states
has
reported
to
the
congress,
as
of
july
30,
1973
proposing
substantial
revisions
in
the
bankruptcy
law
and
proposing
that
as
to
this
particular
issue,
under
a
provision
with
regard
to
exemptions
that
income
tax
refunds,
accrued
vacation
pay,
receivables,
cash
and
securities
be
considered
to
be
exempt
in
the
aggregate
of
not
more
than
$500.00.
but
the
standard
proposed
by
the
petitioner
is
unsound
and
its
application
would
result,
it
seems
to
me,
in
severe
discrimination
between
bankrupts.
one
bankrupt
may
indeed
need
$75.00
for
medical
treatment.
the
second
$500.00
for
his
wife’s
operation,
and
the
third
$2,000.00
for
the
tuition
for
his
children’s
education,
all
certainly
are
legitimate
and
valid
needs.
but
in
no
sense
can
it
be
said
that
such
a
standard
would
achieve
the
purposes
of
the
act
nor
that
the
tax
refund
claim
in
varying
amounts,
which
in
some
instances
may
amount
to
in
excess
of
a
$1,000.00
would
serve
these
varying
purposes
or
needs.
there
is
a
suggestion
in
the
brief
that
because
the
amount
of
a
tax
refund
in
this
case
is
small,
and
because
administration
costs
and
expenses
are
significant
in
some
instances
that
very
little
of
this
amount
of
money
will
trickle
down
to
the
creditors
and
therefore,
wouldn’t
it
be
better
to
give
it
to
the
needy
bankrupt.
the
answer
to
that,
i
think
comes
in
different
ways.
one,
administration
costs
and
expenses
are
not
necessarily
evil.
they
are
in
the
act
and
they
are
in
fact,
under
section
64,
given
first
priority
with
regard
to
payments
from
the
assets
accumulated.
secondly,
there
is
no
support
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
the
$250.90
would
be
exhausted
by
administrative
costs
and
expenses.
and
in
other
cases
where
the
refund
may
be
substantially
greater,
there
is
no
suggestion
that
such
administrative
costs
and
expenses
will
even
substantially
beat
it
into
the
assets.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
if
you
would
follow
the
argument
of
the
petition
--
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
i
think
that
is
correct,
especially
in
a
wage
earner’s
case,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
in
one
route
or
another,
one
either
direct
or
indirect
all
of
the
property
or
all
assets
are
derived
from
his
only
source,
which
is
wages.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
that’s
true.
i
think
the
brookings
study
showed
that
in
70%
of
the
cases,
there
were
no
asset
cases
at
all.
third,
if
as
the
petitioner
points
out
on
page
16
of
his
brief,
a
survey
indicates
that
the
average
dividend
to
unsecured
creditors
is
only
7%,
then
that
alone
does
not
seem
to
me
a
justification
to
further
reduce
the
percentage
on
one
of
the
basic
designs
of
the
act
to
return
money
to
the
creditors,
from
7%
closer
to
zero.
fourthly,
and
perhaps
most
importantly
and
i
think
it
occurs
in
varying
degrees,
in
varying
in
districts
and
jurisdictions,
abandonment
is
available,
where
appropriate
in
such
small
asset
cases.
i
think
the
california
cases
suggest
that
some
of
the
referees
there
and
the
district
courts
there
have
adopted
the
policy
of
--
if
the
refund
claim
is
the
only
asset
and
it’s
less
than
$150.00,
that
they
would
treat
it
as
abandonment,
as
a
no
asset
case
and
no
trustee
would
be
appointed
and
the
$10.00
will
be
even
saved
in
the
cost
of
the
bankrupt.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
yes,
indeed
it
does,
at
least
that
is
my
understanding
from
review
of
the
cases
and
the
record.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
it
purports
to,
yes.
(voice
overlap)
whether
or
not
it’s
a
proper
exercise
of
the
discretion
or
as
views
in
those
instances,
where
for
instance
the
amount
of
the
tax
refund
claim
might
be
several
$700.00
or
$800.00,
or
$1,500.00,
i
believe
in
the
cedor
case,
the
amount
was
about
$660.00.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
the
trustee
has
the
discretion
to
abandon
if
authorized
by
the
referee.
the
referee
would
have
to
authorize
the
abandonment,
and
then
the
trustee,
i
believe,
would
do
so
without
that
authorization.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
no.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
the
abandonment
provision?
i
do
not
know
your
honor.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
that’s
true.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
well,
there
is
a
decision.
there
are
two
decisions
mr.
justice
white.
one
is
if
the
referee
finds
that
there
is
only
for
instance
a
tax
refund
which
looks
to
be
$150.00,
he
can
at
that
point
determine
that,
that
asset
should
abandon
the
referee
and
not
appoint
a
trustee
and
treat
it
as
a
non-asset
case.
the
second
situation
is
where
the
same
--
let
us
take
the
same
a
$150.00
tax
refund
claim
and
perhaps
some
uncertainty
as
to
other
assets
and
then
a
trustee
is
appointed.
then,
a
second
decision
would
seem
to
me
to
have
to
be
made
by
the
trustee
initially,
as
to
whether
to
pursue
the
tax
refund
claim
if
he
determined
there
were
no
other
further
assets,
and
then
have
the
authorization
receive
for
such
abandonment
by
or
from
the
referee.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
in
the
second
circuit
case
in
our
case,
suggested
that
if
the
needs
of
the
bankrupt
were
great
enough
that
a
deprivation
of
the
amount
of
the
tax
refund
claim,
$150.00,
$200.00,
$300.00
would
amount
to
a
substantial
inequity,
a
severe
hardship
or
harshness,
then
it
could
reasonably
conclude
that
abandonment
was
proper.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
yes,
that
was
another
reason,
i
believe,
stated
or
expressed
in
a
few
sentences
why
the
court
suggested
that
either
the
appointment
of
a
trustee
was
unnecessary
or
if
one
had
been
appointed
then,
a
very
quick
determination
that
then
it
was
proper.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
i
am
not
certain
of
that,
of
agreement
with
that
statement.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
mr.
justice
white,
i
misspoke
myself
in
answer
to
a
question
that
you
addressed
to
me
prior
to
the
noon
recess
with
regard
to
abandonment
in
the
second
circuit’s
opinion
and
direction
to
the
lower
courts
in
kokoszka.
there,
they
restricted
the
application
of
abandonment
to
the
situation
wherein
the
assets
available
to
the
trustee
would
be
entirely
consumed
by
the
trustee’s
fee
and
other
administrative
expenses.
and,
there
was
no
creditor
who
showed
other
available
assets,
which
could
be
reached
and
judge
webster
in
the
dissent
in
gehrig
took
the
same
position,
so
that
my
--
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
i
would
think
that
is
a
fair
conclusion.
my
argument
has
proceeded
along
the
lines
that
there
is
no
legitimate
distinction
between
the
principles
applicable
to
this
case
and
those
past
cases
concerning
properties,
segal
v.
rochelle
and
the
antecedent
cases,
legg
v.
st.
john
and
in
mind,
the
concept
of
“fresh
start”
local
loan
v.
hunt.
the
segal
case,
i
suggest
was
a
more
difficult
case
than
the
one
presented
here
because
the
petitioners
had
filed
for
bankruptcy
before
the
end
of
the
tax
year,
and
thus
any
refund
was
demandable
nor
collectible
immediately
nor
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
petition
in
bankruptcy,
nor
was
the
amount
there
of
fixed,
nor
truly
determinable
with
the
exact
certainty.
furthermore,
the
carry
back
tax
loss
resulted
in
a
tax
refund,
which
the
trustee
was
found
entitled
to
receive.
even
though
the
tax
was
paid,
it
had
been
paid
from
the
individual
earnings
of
the
bankrupt
taxpayers.
there
was
no
suggestion
in
that
case,
in
the
opinion
in
that
case
by
this
court
that
the
amounts
in
segal
respectively
of
$283.00
and
$1,600.00
for
gerald
segal
in
the
carry
back
years
of
1960
and
1959
and
like
amounts
for
sam
segal
could
not
have
been
well
used
by
them
in
obtaining
the
necessary
fresh
start
in
their
new
economic
life.
the
court
took,
i
suggest,
pains
to
emphasize
the
lost
carry
back
claim
there
was
sufficiently
rooted
in
the
prebankruptcy
past
and
so
little
entangle
with
the
bankruptcy
to
make
unencumbered
fresh
start
that
it
should
be
regarded
as
the
property
under
section
70
(a)
(5),
despite
the
substantial
differences,
which
i
suggest
make
this
case
considerably
easier
in
determination
of
the
question
of
property.
the
tax
refund
claim
is
fixed
and
certain
as
to
amount
demandable
and
collectible
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
petition
and
i
suggest
has
no
relationship
to
future
wages
nor
after
acquired
property,
both
of
which
elements
were
certainly
controlling
in
the
lines
case
and
had
some
effect
in
the
segal
case.
a
decision
upholding
the
second
circuit
and
the
trustee
would
not
only
be
consistent
with
lines
v.
frederick,
but
would
further
serve
to
confirm
the
plain
meaning
and
intent
of
the
principles
recognized
so
clearly
in
the
case,
future
wages
and
after
acquired
property
are
necessary,
essential
elements
of
the
concept
of
a
fresh
start.
there
is
no
legitimate
distinction,
i
suggest
between
a
tax
refund
claim
and
any
other
moneys
or
funds
obtained
by
payroll
withholding
from
past
wages
pursuant
to
a
savings
plan,
a
christmas
club,
a
bond
the
month
plan,
a
retail
lay
away
plan,
an
educational
loan
repayment
plan,
or
agreement,
union
dues,
auto
insurance,
real
estate
tax
or
any
other
established
payroll
deduction,
which
could
result
in
a
refund
or
repayment
from
a
second
or
third
source.
mr.
benjamin
r.
civiletti
well,
the
term
voluntary,
i
think
that
is
true,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
that
they
would
argue
that
that
is
a
distinction.
i
suggest
that
number
one,
the
meaning
of
voluntary
varies,
depending
on
its
application
and
that
pursuant
to
a
loan
agreement
for
instance,
once
the
decision
is
made,
then
that
payment
or
deduction
from
payroll
might
well
no
longer
be
considered
to
be
voluntary.
similarly
here,
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
pointed
out,
the
voluntariness
to
some
extent
is
available
to
the
taxpayer
in
the
manner
in
which
he
proscribes
his
withholding
and
it
is
adjustable
during
the
course
of
the
year,
depending
on
changes
and
circumstances
by
him.
turning
to
the
consumer
credit
protection
act,
my
argument
there
is
a
very
short
and
brief
one.
it
is
not
applicable,
because
the
tax
refund
claim
here
does
not
come
within
the
definitional
term
of
earnings
in
that
act.
it
is
not
compensation
paid
or
payable
for
past
services.
it
does
not
come
within
the
definition
of
the
term
disposable
earnings,
because
it
is
not
that
part
of
earnings
remaining
after
deductions
allowed
by
law.
and
lastly,
it
is
not
within
the
term
the
definition
of
garnishment,
which
in
the
language
of
the
statute
means
any
legal
or
equitable
procedure
through
which
the
earnings
of
any
individual
are
required
to
be
withheld
for
the
payment
of
any
debt.
here,
if
this
is
property
then
it
vests
in
the
trustee
by
operation
of
law
and
it
is
not
required
to
be
withheld
for
the
payment
of
any
debt
pursuant
for
instance,
to
provisions
of
seizure
or
collection
under
section
70
(c)
of
the
bankruptcy
act.
the
reference
in
the
consumer
credit
protection
act,
specific
reference
in
that
act,
chapter
13
of
the
bankruptcy
act
and
saying
that
the
provisions
of
the
consumer
credit
protection
act
do
not
apply
to
chapter
13
arrangements
was
made
because
chapter
13
arrangements
do
apply
to
future
wages,
do
specifically
provide
for
the
deduction
for
the
payment
to
creditors
for
past
debts,
pursuant
to
the
plan
approved
by
the
referee,
and
therefore,
was
necessary
in
order
to
make
clear
that
the
25%
limitation
would
not
apply
to
such
arrangements
that
chapter
13
should
be
specifically
referred
in
the
consumer
credit
protection
act.
thank
you.
