mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
would
be
useful
for
the
court
to
focus
on
the
text
of
this
statute,
which
is
set
fort
on
page
two
of
petitioner’s
brief.
the
statute
provides
that
one,
if
a
corporation
adopts
the
plan
of
complete
liquidation
and
then
two,
with
in
a
12-month
period
beginning
on
the
date
of
the
adoption
of
the
plan,
all
of
its
assets
are
distributed
in
complete
liquidation
to
it
shareholders.
then
and
only
then
shall
no
a
gain
or
loss
be
recognized
to
the
corporation
from
the
sale
or
exchange
by
it
of
property
within
the
12-month
period.
statute
mandates
a
particular
time
sequence
of
events.
first,
a
plan
must
be
adopted
thereby
identifying
the
corporation
as
one
which
is
commencing
a
liquidation
process.
secondly,
once
the
plan
is
adopted,
then
a
12-month
period
begins
to
commence
running
forward
in
time.
the
statute
is
a
strict
statute,
it’s
so
far
as
sales
or
exchanges
occurring
before
the
adoption
of
the
plan
or
sales
or
exchanges
occurring
after
the
12-month
period
has
run
cannot
be
protected
by
the
non
recognition
provisions
of
the
statute.
now,
here,
the
sequence
of
events
which
have
occurred
in
this
transaction
demonstrate
that
it
is
exactly
the
reverse
of
the
situation
that
congress
intended
to
benefit
by
the
statute.
because
first,
we
have
here
the
file
on
september
10,
1965,
at
that
point
in
time,
the
taxpayer
did
not
evidence
any
intension
to
liquidate,
indeed
it
has
been
discussed
the
file
itself
prompted
the
decision
to
liquidate
in
part
because
a
major
asset
of
a
corporation
was
destroyed.
then
some
more
than
eight
months
later
on
may
14th
1966,
petitioner
adopted
a
plan
of
complete
liquidation
by
action
of
its
board
of
directors
and
presumably
by
ratification
of
its
shareholders.
now,
in
order
to
place
the
gain
accruing
from
the
insurance
proceeds,
the
petitioner
must
somehow
place
that
gain
after
the
adoption
of
the
plan
that
is
after
may
14th
1966.
for
it
arises
before,
the
statute
cannot
apply.
now,
it
does
this
by
arguing
that
what
has
occurred
here
after
the
plan
was
somewhat
like
in
negotiation
of
sale,
it
dickered
with
the
insurance
company
over
the
amount
of
the
award,
and
ultimately,
that
was
concluded
sometime
in
august,
after
the
adoption
of
the
plan.
but,
it
is
plain
what
occurred
here
was
not
a
sales
negotiation
in
any
sense
that
term
represents.
it
was
simply
a
compensation
for
loss
which
the
insurance
company
pays
pursuant
to
the
contract
of
buyer
insurance.
this
post-buyer
discussions
which
the
petitioner
had
with
its
insurance
company
is
simply
directed
to
the
amount
of
the
compensation,
and
the
fact
that
this
transaction
is
not
a
sale,
it’s
well
settled
by
this
court’s
decision
in
flack
flaccus
leather
company.
now,
the
fact
that
this
is
not
a
sale
might
be
deemed
to
the
end
of
the
matter
for
we
have
a
statute
here
that
talks
about
a
sale.
but,
it
is
not
the
end
of
the
matter
because
two
court
decisions,
the
court
of
claims,
and
that
towanda
textiles
case,
and
the
kent
manufacturing
decisions
of
the
fourth
circuit
have
included
within
the
context
of
section
337,
gains
from
involuntary
conversions
such
as
this,
that
is
gains
from
the
destruction
of
property.
but,
the
situation
of
those
cases
is
entirely
different
insofar
as
those
--
the
facts
that
those
cases
can
be
fit
within
the
time
sequence
mandated
by
congress
in
the
statute.
that
is
that
the
plan
occurs
first
and
then
the
gain
arise
afterwards.
now,
in
the
case
involved
in
towanda
textiles
case,
we
had
a
situation
where
the
corporation
first
adopted
the
plan
of
complete
liquidation
and
then
subsequent
to
that
time,
the
fire
occurred.
in
that
sense,
one
could
say,
as
the
court
of
claims
did,
that
the
fire
interrupted
the
liquidation
process,
which
had
already
been
commenced
by
the
operation
of
the
plan
pursuant
to
the
statute.
and,
it
is
the
court
of
claims’
reason
if
the
destruction
had
not
occurred
towanda
textiles,
the
property
would
have
been
sold
in
the
normal
course
of
liquidation
pursuant
to
the
section
337
plan
within
the
12-month
period.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
government
opposed
that
result
in
the
court
of
claims
on
the
ground
that
no
sale
or
exchange
occurred.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
government’s
position
surely
is
that
if
all
the
assets
of
the
corporation
and
not
distributed
within
the
12-month
period
then
the
statute
doesn’t
apply,
but
that’s
the
kind
of
situation,
mr.
justice
blackmun
which
is
easily
remedied
by
a
corporation
in
that
posture
simply
by
distributing
the
claim
to
its
shareholders
pro-rata.
so,
there
would
be
no
problem
with
that
arranging
for
compliance
with
the
statute.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
commissioner
acquiesces
to
the
proposition
of
those
cases,
that
a
sale
or
exchange
that
gains
--
that
section
337
gains
includes
gains
from
involuntary
conversion.
but
the
point
of
those
cases,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
the
statutory
time
sequence
was
observed
in
those
cases
insofar
as
what
the
statute
was
meant
to
cover
was
a
corporation
identifying
itself
as
a
corporation
in
liquidation,
and
that
without
the
adoption
of
the
plan,
such
a
corporation
has
not
commenced
a
liquidation
process.
and
i
think
that
those
cases
can
best
be
explained
in
terms
of
the
reason
that
prompt
to
their
result
by
the
fact
that
had
the
fire
not
occurred
in
those
cases,
the
corporation
surely
would
have
sold
the
property
pursuant
to
the
normal
kind
of
section
337
plan
that
tax
practitioners
are
well
familiar
with.
what
we
have
here,
at
the
time
of
the
fire,
the
petitioner
was
not
planning
to
sell
its
building
pursuant
to
a
plan
of
liquidation.
its
intension
to
liquidate
was
formed
after
the
fire,
and
to
that
extent,
we
feel
that
the
plan
here
should
not
relate
back
to
the
fire
anymore
than
a
subsequently
within
a
plan
should
relate
back
to
a
prior
sale.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
taxes
at
issue
here
presumably
of
the
year
of
the
payment.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
if
you
are
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer
and
all
the
events
have
been
fixed,
the
gain
would
reportable
in
‘65.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
they’re
‘66
taxes
but
the
point
of
that,
mr.
justice
white
that
simply
goes
to
when
the
tax
is
--
when
that
gain
is
realized
for
the
purposes
of
reporting
[voice
overlap].
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
loss
would
be
approval
presumably
at
a
time
when
it
became
clear
that
the
loss
--
that
there
would
be
a
loss.
but
following
that
point
to
its
conclusion,
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
net
effect
to
the
taxpayer’s
position,
in
this
case
would
be
to
foreclose
its
recognition
of
a
loss
under
such
circumstances.
because
if
the
loss
arose
as
of
the
time
that
the
insurance
company
finally
decided
not
to
pay
off
or
to
pay
off
not
an
excessive
basis.
then,
petitioner’s
position
here
that
that
loss
should
be
recognized
that
time
would
result
in
the
loss
arising
after
the
adoption
of
a
plan.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
certainly
for
cash
basis
taxpayer.
for
the
accrual
base
taxpayer,
i
would
suggest
that
if
it
at
the
end
of
the
year,
let’s
say
on
december
20,
it
became
clear
what
the
amount
of
the
loss
was
but
the
check
were
not
paid
until
in
the
next
year.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
apparently
not
so
here.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
now,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
--
since
the
statute
clearly
would
not
apply
to
a
situation
where
a
sale
took
place
and
then
the
plan
were
adopted.
i
think
that
the
implication
of
the
petitioner’s
position
here
would
be
--
would
be
to
give
a
preference
to
those
taxpayers
suffering
a
destruction
of
property
that
is
not
available
to
taxpayers
simply
selling
corporate
assets
in
the
normal
course
of
a
liquidation.
now,
we
think
that
the
condemnation
cases,
the
lines
of
positions
involving
condemnation
offer
a
useful
analogy
at
our
on
instructive
as
it
correct
results
was
to
release
--
which
should
be
reached
here.
what
we
have
in
this
mind
of
decisions
is
a
uniform
holdings
of
all
the
courts
of
appeals
to
the
effect
that
in
s
condemnation
situation
where
the
taking
of
the
property
takes
place
prior
to
the
adoption
of
a
plan
of
liquidation.
then,
the
gain
from
that
condemnation
cannot
be
covered
by
section
337
because
the
plan
arose
afterwards.
now,
this
is
the
holdings
of
these
cases
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
a
condemnation
proceeding
may
be
litigated
for
several
years,
and
the
exact
amount
of
the
award
may
not
be
fixed
for
several
years.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
situations
are
varied
under
both
federal
and
state
condemnation
proceedings.
we
saw
the
case
called
dwight
versus
united
states,
a
second
circuit
case
which
involved
a
state
condemnation.
in
that
situation
is
very
much
like
a
sudden
event
of
fire.
the
board
of
estimate
of
new
york
city
simply
filed
a
damage
map
in
the
court,
and
that
resulted
in
the
taking
of
property.
to
let
the
condemnation
proceeding
to
fix
the
amount
of
the
just
compensation
stretched
over
many
years
without
any
payment.
and
second
circuit
held
in
that
case
that
notwithstanding,
the
fact
that
the
condemnation
was
sudden
and
that
the
petitioner
there
could
not
--
the
taxpayer
there
could
not
even
finely
adopt
the
plan
even
it
had
known
of
the
--
because
it
did
not
know
the
event
still,
section
337
did
not
apply
to
insulate
these
gains
from
corporate
taxation.
and,
there
are
other
federal
condemnation
situations
notably
in
the
likins-foster
honolulu
case
which
we
cite,
where
there
are
deposits
that
paid
in
before
then
the
condemnee
can
draw
down
on
it.
but,
i
think
that
the
situation
--
the
situation
sufficiently
vary
that
you
can’t
really
make
a
general
rule
about
the
practice
on
the
condemnation
proceedings.
when
the
second
circuit
considered
the
dwight
case,
it
was
based
with
the
situation
far
more,
shall
we
say
“harsh”
than
this
case,
because
the
board
of
estimate
simply
filed
this
damage
map,
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter.
the
taxpayer
simply
did
not
have
time
to
adopt
the
plan
of
complete
liquidation.
the
second
circuit
simply
said
the
statute
has
strict
requirements
and
if
it
is
to
be
modified
to
cover
all
gains
from
involuntary
conversions
then
congress
has
to
modify
the
statute.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
an
advisory
commission
in
1959,
so
urge
congress
to
modify
the
statute
to
cover
all
gains
from
involuntary
conversions
whether
they
arise
before
--
whether
the
event
arises
before
or
after
the
adoption
of
the
plan
and
congress
did
not
act
on
this
proposal.
so,
what
you
have
here
is
a
situation
where
taxpayers
subjected
to
sudden
events
such
as
condemnation,
clearly
cannot
have
the
benefit
of
this
statute
if
they
do
not
abide
by
the
statutory
time
sequence
of
first
adopting
the
plan
and
then
within
the
12-months
experiencing
this
event.
what
the
taxpayer’s
position
here
would
lead
to,
we
submit,
would
be
a
situation
where
taxpayers
suffering
destruction
of
insured
property
would
be
accorded
to
preference
of
a
taxpayer’s
suffering
a
sudden
condemnation
very
similar
to
what
happened
in
the
dwight
case.
now,
what
petitioner
attempts
to
distinguished
these
condemnation
cases,
it
says,
condemnation
creates
an
enforceable
obligation
to
pay
a
certain
amount
of
just
compensation
by
the
condemning
authority.
but,
the
destruction
of
its
insured
property
here
gave
rise,
so
it
says,
to
simply
a
conditional
or
contingent
claim.
but
what
are
these
contingencies
that
the
taxpayer
is
relying
upon
to
base
its
arguments
to
push
forward
to
this
positive
event
after
the
adoption
of
a
plan
in
there.
it
talks
about
the
filing
of
a
notice
of
loss,
it
talks
about
the
filing
of
a
proof
of
loss,
and
it
talks
about
other
proof
complying
with
other
procedural
requirements
under
the
contract
of
insurance.
but
the
record
here
indicates
that
these
procedural
requirements
had
already
been
met
by
petitioner
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
plan.
for
example,
a
record
indicates
here
that
negotiation
where
the
fire
started,
fire
was
on
september
10th,1965,
the
negotiations
that
the
petitioner
commenced
with
insurance
property
began
as
early
as
october
8,
1965.
in
fact,
petitioner’s
own
counsel
in
the
district
court,
testify
that
the
proof
of
loss
in
this
case
was
filed
prior
to
december
1965,
again
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
plan.
petitioner
does
not
meet
its
own
proposed
test,
and
that
is
the
test
proposed
by
the
district
court
in
kinney
case
on
which
it
relied.
but
in
any
event,
we
don’t
think
that
these
procedural
requirements
under
the
insurance
contract
create
the
claim
against
the
insurance
company
because
just
as
a
condemnation
taking
creates
the
claim
under
--
against
the
condemning
authority.
so
thus,
the
destructive
event
of
the
fire,
we
submit,
creates
the
claim
against
the
insurance
company.
but
as
this
irrevocable
event
of
either
taking
by
condemnation
or
by
fire,
which
converts
the
property
into
the
obligation
running
against
the
insurance
company
go
with
the
authority.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
don’t
think
it
should
make
any
difference,
mr.
justice
powell.
i
think
what
you
have
here
is
a
--
in
effect
an
irrevocable
transformation
of
property
from
a
property
which
exists
to
a
property
which
has
been
destroyed,
and
that
creates
in
the
case
--
of
your
case
of
negligence,
the
case
creates
an
obligation
on
the
on
the
common
law,
i
suppose
for
recompense,
which
will
not
elevate
it
to
a
contractual
claim
would
nevertheless
still
represent
the
claim
against
the
negligent
party.
i
don’t
think
that
should
make
a
difference.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
would
be
a
casualty
loss
to
the
corporation.
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
can
say
that
is
--
well,
it
would
be
a
casualty
and
loss
unless
it
was
covered
under
another
provision
section
1231
of
the
code,
which
provides
for
netting
of
losses
on
involuntary
conversions
against
gains
which
from
the
sale
of
capital
assets.
so,
i
don’t
think
i
could
answer
completely
that
that
would
be,
you
know,
an
ordinary
loss,
but
if
there
were
no
other
gains
presumably
it
would
be
an
ordinary
one.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absent
such
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right.
having
such
details
and
is
depreciation
of
the
kind.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
have
to
take
that
into
income.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that’s
the
principle
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
if
we
are
on
a
12-month
plan
of
liquidation
at
the
time
of
the
recovery,
i
think
that
this
question
as
to
when
you
take
something
in
to
income
are
wholly
a
part
from
the
question
as
to
whether
the
plan
applies.
i
mean,
if
the
casualty
occurred
prior
to
the
law,
let’s
say
in
the
middle
of
the
plan
of
complete
liquidation
then
presumably,
if
that
were
a
loss,
that
would
be
an
uninsured
loss,
so
to
speak,
then
you
would
have
a
loss
that
wouldn’t
be
recognized.
isn’t
that
right?
because
it
would
carry
after
the
plan.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
so
then,
in
the
subsequent
year
when
you
get
money
into
income
since
you
have
not
deducted
that
loss,
presumably,
i
would
imagine
that
that
should
have
to
be
taken
into
income
since
i
can’t
think
of
any
reason
why
it
shouldn’t.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
well,
this
raises
a
question
as
to
whether
you
are
--
i
suppose
under
the
tax
benefit
rule,
if
you
had
not
got
any
tax
benefit
from
the
loss,
you
don’t
have
to
take
that
it
into
income.
i
was
imagining
it
would
be
only
the
net
of
the
loss,
i
think
that’s
right.
now,
we
think
that
this
subsequent
events
upon
which
petitioner
relies,
that
is
its
negotiations
with
the
insurance
company,
its
compliance
with
the
procedural
requirements
of
the
policy
simply
go
if
an
aid
of
the
collection
of
the
claim.
they
do
not
create
the
claim
against
the
insurance
company.
now,
while
the
taxpayer
recognizes
that
this
transaction
is
not
a
sale
here,
it
argues
that
into
its
reply
brief,
it
has
many
of
the
characteristics
of
a
sale.
what
it
says
in
effect
is
the
insurance
award
is
analogous
to
a
sales
price,
and
it
assumes
that
you
cannot
have
a
sale
without
a
determinable
sales
price.
well,
this
assumption
which
was
made
by
the
morton
opinion
as
well,
we
think
is
erroneous.
there
are
many
instances
where
you
can
have
a
sale
not
only
for
tax
purposes
but
for
any
purpose
without
the
existence
of
the
determinable
sales
prices.
for
example,
a
business
can
be
sold
for
a
percentage
of
future
profits
over
a
stated
period
of
time,
and
the
sales
price
in
that
situation
is
not
determinable
until
the
end
of
the
period.
but
no
one
would
doubt
it,
there
were
a
transfer
of
the
benefits
and
burdens
of
ownership
to
that
business,
that
there
was
a
sale,
clearly
a
sale
occurs
in
that
case.
and
to
that
extent,
we
think
that
the
petitioner’s
analogy
is
false.
alternatively,
the
taxpayer
argues
here
that
the
payment
by
the
insurance
company
could
be
a
sale.
it
talks
about
a
situation
where
the
insurance
company
will
pay
an
adjustment
for
salvage,
and
presumably
take
over
the
ownership
of
the
property.
now,
first
of
all,
there’s
no
showing
that
it
has
occurred
here,
it
didn’t
occur
here.
well,
this
payment
was
simply
compensation
for
a
loss,
but
even
if
there
was
--
even
in
such
a
situation,
we
think
that
the
compensation
for
the
loss
element
of
the
payment
would
not
be
analogous
to
a
sales
price,
so
to
speak,
because
that
simply
is
a
payment
for
a
decrease
in
value
of
the
damaged
property,
value
which
has
disappeared.
that
is
--
can
in
no
way,
be
analogize
to
an
element
of
the
payment
which
would
be
in
the
sales
price.
and
finally,
as
we
point
out
in
greater
detail
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
the
net
effect
of
the
petitioner’s
position
here
is
contrary
to
settled
rules
governing
the
holding
period
of
property.
almost
40
years
ago,
this
court
held
in
the
mcphee
case,
that
holding
period
--
the
concept
of
holding
period
is
coterminous
with
the
concept
of
ownership.
and,
as
corollary
to
those
cases,
there
are
other
cases
which
hold,
that
when
property
is
destroyed,
its
holding
period
ends.
now,
those
holdings
were
rendered
in
a
situations
involving
sunken
ships,
but
the
lesson
is
equally
instructive
here.
in
those
cases,
a
taxpayer
board
a
ship
on
january
1st
and
then
it
sunk
on
march
1st,
to
use
the
example.
the
insurance
proceeds
however
were
not
paid
until
july
15,
and
what
the
taxpayers
in
those
cases
argued
was
that
the
holding
period
--
their
holding
period
should
be
stretched
forward
beyond
six
months
to
the
point
where
the
insurance
proceeds
were
paid
and
in
that
way,
to
try
to
get
long
term
capital
gain.
now,
the
court
rejected
that
notion.
the
holding
period
ended
when
the
ship
sunk,
when
the
destructive
event
occur.
so,
we
think
that
the
--
we
think
that
those
holdings
are
instructive
as
to
the
error
that
petitioners
making
in
this
argument.
because
if
petitioner’s
argument
is
right
that
its
so
called
“sale”
under
the
statute
did
not
occur
until
the
insurance
proceeds
were
paid,
the
implication
of
its
argument
is
that
a
sale
occurred
long
before
after
its
coterminous
holding
period,
an
ownership
have
ended.
we
think
that’s
wrong
and
we
think
that
that’s
simply
another
demonstration
of
the
error
of
petitioner’s
position
and
the
reason
why
the
court’s
judgment
at
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
section
1033
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
then
the
property
was
sold?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
presumably,
i
don’t
think
there
would
be
a
problem
because
what
you
got
there
is
simply
the
property
sold
after
the
adoption
of
the
plan.
the
fact
that
it
took
advantage
of
another
provision
of
the
internal
revenue
code
to
reconstruct
the
property,
and
get
a
carry
of
the
basis,
i
don’t
think
it
would
present
any
problem.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
substantially
the
same
result,
yes.
but
in
the
situation
you
posited,
i
think,
mr.
justice
powell,
that
the
statutory
time
sequence
in
section
337
is
observed
and
so
far
as
the
property
is
restore,
then
the
plan
is
adopted
and
then
the
property
is
sold.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
in
many
ways,
a
federal
tax
factor,
that
didn’t
occur
here.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
mean,
we
view
the
statutory
requirements
as
precise.
it
is
a
cliché
but
nevertheless,
a
somewhat
with
a
ring
of
truth
to
it
that
you
can’t
be
judged
for
federal
tax
purposes
on
the
basis
of
what
you
didn’t
or
what
they
didn’t
do
that
here.
i
have
nothing
further
to
say.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
would
be
useful
for
the
court
to
focus
on
the
text
of
this
statute,
which
is
set
fort
on
page
two
of
petitioner’s
brief.
the
statute
provides
that
one,
if
a
corporation
adopts
the
plan
of
complete
liquidation
and
then
two,
with
in
a
12-month
period
beginning
on
the
date
of
the
adoption
of
the
plan,
all
of
its
assets
are
distributed
in
complete
liquidation
to
it
shareholders.
then
and
only
then
shall
no
a
gain
or
loss
be
recognized
to
the
corporation
from
the
sale
or
exchange
by
it
of
property
within
the
12-month
period.
statute
mandates
a
particular
time
sequence
of
events.
first,
a
plan
must
be
adopted
thereby
identifying
the
corporation
as
one
which
is
commencing
a
liquidation
process.
secondly,
once
the
plan
is
adopted,
then
a
12-month
period
begins
to
commence
running
forward
in
time.
the
statute
is
a
strict
statute,
it’s
so
far
as
sales
or
exchanges
occurring
before
the
adoption
of
the
plan
or
sales
or
exchanges
occurring
after
the
12-month
period
has
run
cannot
be
protected
by
the
non
recognition
provisions
of
the
statute.
now,
here,
the
sequence
of
events
which
have
occurred
in
this
transaction
demonstrate
that
it
is
exactly
the
reverse
of
the
situation
that
congress
intended
to
benefit
by
the
statute.
because
first,
we
have
here
the
file
on
september
10,
1965,
at
that
point
in
time,
the
taxpayer
did
not
evidence
any
intension
to
liquidate,
indeed
it
has
been
discussed
the
file
itself
prompted
the
decision
to
liquidate
in
part
because
a
major
asset
of
a
corporation
was
destroyed.
then
some
more
than
eight
months
later
on
may
14th
1966,
petitioner
adopted
a
plan
of
complete
liquidation
by
action
of
its
board
of
directors
and
presumably
by
ratification
of
its
shareholders.
now,
in
order
to
place
the
gain
accruing
from
the
insurance
proceeds,
the
petitioner
must
somehow
place
that
gain
after
the
adoption
of
the
plan
that
is
after
may
14th
1966.
for
it
arises
before,
the
statute
cannot
apply.
now,
it
does
this
by
arguing
that
what
has
occurred
here
after
the
plan
was
somewhat
like
in
negotiation
of
sale,
it
dickered
with
the
insurance
company
over
the
amount
of
the
award,
and
ultimately,
that
was
concluded
sometime
in
august,
after
the
adoption
of
the
plan.
but,
it
is
plain
what
occurred
here
was
not
a
sales
negotiation
in
any
sense
that
term
represents.
it
was
simply
a
compensation
for
loss
which
the
insurance
company
pays
pursuant
to
the
contract
of
buyer
insurance.
this
post-buyer
discussions
which
the
petitioner
had
with
its
insurance
company
is
simply
directed
to
the
amount
of
the
compensation,
and
the
fact
that
this
transaction
is
not
a
sale,
it’s
well
settled
by
this
court’s
decision
in
flack
flaccus
leather
company.
now,
the
fact
that
this
is
not
a
sale
might
be
deemed
to
the
end
of
the
matter
for
we
have
a
statute
here
that
talks
about
a
sale.
but,
it
is
not
the
end
of
the
matter
because
two
court
decisions,
the
court
of
claims,
and
that
towanda
textiles
case,
and
the
kent
manufacturing
decisions
of
the
fourth
circuit
have
included
within
the
context
of
section
337,
gains
from
involuntary
conversions
such
as
this,
that
is
gains
from
the
destruction
of
property.
but,
the
situation
of
those
cases
is
entirely
different
insofar
as
those
--
the
facts
that
those
cases
can
be
fit
within
the
time
sequence
mandated
by
congress
in
the
statute.
that
is
that
the
plan
occurs
first
and
then
the
gain
arise
afterwards.
now,
in
the
case
involved
in
towanda
textiles
case,
we
had
a
situation
where
the
corporation
first
adopted
the
plan
of
complete
liquidation
and
then
subsequent
to
that
time,
the
fire
occurred.
in
that
sense,
one
could
say,
as
the
court
of
claims
did,
that
the
fire
interrupted
the
liquidation
process,
which
had
already
been
commenced
by
the
operation
of
the
plan
pursuant
to
the
statute.
and,
it
is
the
court
of
claims’
reason
if
the
destruction
had
not
occurred
towanda
textiles,
the
property
would
have
been
sold
in
the
normal
course
of
liquidation
pursuant
to
the
section
337
plan
within
the
12-month
period.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
government
opposed
that
result
in
the
court
of
claims
on
the
ground
that
no
sale
or
exchange
occurred.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
the
government’s
position
surely
is
that
if
all
the
assets
of
the
corporation
and
not
distributed
within
the
12-month
period
then
the
statute
doesn’t
apply,
but
that’s
the
kind
of
situation,
mr.
justice
blackmun
which
is
easily
remedied
by
a
corporation
in
that
posture
simply
by
distributing
the
claim
to
its
shareholders
pro-rata.
so,
there
would
be
no
problem
with
that
arranging
for
compliance
with
the
statute.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
commissioner
acquiesces
to
the
proposition
of
those
cases,
that
a
sale
or
exchange
that
gains
--
that
section
337
gains
includes
gains
from
involuntary
conversion.
but
the
point
of
those
cases,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
the
statutory
time
sequence
was
observed
in
those
cases
insofar
as
what
the
statute
was
meant
to
cover
was
a
corporation
identifying
itself
as
a
corporation
in
liquidation,
and
that
without
the
adoption
of
the
plan,
such
a
corporation
has
not
commenced
a
liquidation
process.
and
i
think
that
those
cases
can
best
be
explained
in
terms
of
the
reason
that
prompt
to
their
result
by
the
fact
that
had
the
fire
not
occurred
in
those
cases,
the
corporation
surely
would
have
sold
the
property
pursuant
to
the
normal
kind
of
section
337
plan
that
tax
practitioners
are
well
familiar
with.
what
we
have
here,
at
the
time
of
the
fire,
the
petitioner
was
not
planning
to
sell
its
building
pursuant
to
a
plan
of
liquidation.
its
intension
to
liquidate
was
formed
after
the
fire,
and
to
that
extent,
we
feel
that
the
plan
here
should
not
relate
back
to
the
fire
anymore
than
a
subsequently
within
a
plan
should
relate
back
to
a
prior
sale.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
taxes
at
issue
here
presumably
of
the
year
of
the
payment.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
if
you
are
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer
and
all
the
events
have
been
fixed,
the
gain
would
reportable
in
‘65.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
think
they’re
‘66
taxes
but
the
point
of
that,
mr.
justice
white
that
simply
goes
to
when
the
tax
is
--
when
that
gain
is
realized
for
the
purposes
of
reporting
[voice
overlap].
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
the
loss
would
be
approval
presumably
at
a
time
when
it
became
clear
that
the
loss
--
that
there
would
be
a
loss.
but
following
that
point
to
its
conclusion,
i
think
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
the
net
effect
to
the
taxpayer’s
position,
in
this
case
would
be
to
foreclose
its
recognition
of
a
loss
under
such
circumstances.
because
if
the
loss
arose
as
of
the
time
that
the
insurance
company
finally
decided
not
to
pay
off
or
to
pay
off
not
an
excessive
basis.
then,
petitioner’s
position
here
that
that
loss
should
be
recognized
that
time
would
result
in
the
loss
arising
after
the
adoption
of
a
plan.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
certainly
for
cash
basis
taxpayer.
for
the
accrual
base
taxpayer,
i
would
suggest
that
if
it
at
the
end
of
the
year,
let’s
say
on
december
20,
it
became
clear
what
the
amount
of
the
loss
was
but
the
check
were
not
paid
until
in
the
next
year.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
apparently
not
so
here.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
now,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
--
since
the
statute
clearly
would
not
apply
to
a
situation
where
a
sale
took
place
and
then
the
plan
were
adopted.
i
think
that
the
implication
of
the
petitioner’s
position
here
would
be
--
would
be
to
give
a
preference
to
those
taxpayers
suffering
a
destruction
of
property
that
is
not
available
to
taxpayers
simply
selling
corporate
assets
in
the
normal
course
of
a
liquidation.
now,
we
think
that
the
condemnation
cases,
the
lines
of
positions
involving
condemnation
offer
a
useful
analogy
at
our
on
instructive
as
it
correct
results
was
to
release
--
which
should
be
reached
here.
what
we
have
in
this
mind
of
decisions
is
a
uniform
holdings
of
all
the
courts
of
appeals
to
the
effect
that
in
s
condemnation
situation
where
the
taking
of
the
property
takes
place
prior
to
the
adoption
of
a
plan
of
liquidation.
then,
the
gain
from
that
condemnation
cannot
be
covered
by
section
337
because
the
plan
arose
afterwards.
now,
this
is
the
holdings
of
these
cases
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
a
condemnation
proceeding
may
be
litigated
for
several
years,
and
the
exact
amount
of
the
award
may
not
be
fixed
for
several
years.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
the
situations
are
varied
under
both
federal
and
state
condemnation
proceedings.
we
saw
the
case
called
dwight
versus
united
states,
a
second
circuit
case
which
involved
a
state
condemnation.
in
that
situation
is
very
much
like
a
sudden
event
of
fire.
the
board
of
estimate
of
new
york
city
simply
filed
a
damage
map
in
the
court,
and
that
resulted
in
the
taking
of
property.
to
let
the
condemnation
proceeding
to
fix
the
amount
of
the
just
compensation
stretched
over
many
years
without
any
payment.
and
second
circuit
held
in
that
case
that
notwithstanding,
the
fact
that
the
condemnation
was
sudden
and
that
the
petitioner
there
could
not
--
the
taxpayer
there
could
not
even
finely
adopt
the
plan
even
it
had
known
of
the
--
because
it
did
not
know
the
event
still,
section
337
did
not
apply
to
insulate
these
gains
from
corporate
taxation.
and,
there
are
other
federal
condemnation
situations
notably
in
the
likins-foster
honolulu
case
which
we
cite,
where
there
are
deposits
that
paid
in
before
then
the
condemnee
can
draw
down
on
it.
but,
i
think
that
the
situation
--
the
situation
sufficiently
vary
that
you
can’t
really
make
a
general
rule
about
the
practice
on
the
condemnation
proceedings.
when
the
second
circuit
considered
the
dwight
case,
it
was
based
with
the
situation
far
more,
shall
we
say
“harsh”
than
this
case,
because
the
board
of
estimate
simply
filed
this
damage
map,
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter.
the
taxpayer
simply
did
not
have
time
to
adopt
the
plan
of
complete
liquidation.
the
second
circuit
simply
said
the
statute
has
strict
requirements
and
if
it
is
to
be
modified
to
cover
all
gains
from
involuntary
conversions
then
congress
has
to
modify
the
statute.
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
an
advisory
commission
in
1959,
so
urge
congress
to
modify
the
statute
to
cover
all
gains
from
involuntary
conversions
whether
they
arise
before
--
whether
the
event
arises
before
or
after
the
adoption
of
the
plan
and
congress
did
not
act
on
this
proposal.
so,
what
you
have
here
is
a
situation
where
taxpayers
subjected
to
sudden
events
such
as
condemnation,
clearly
cannot
have
the
benefit
of
this
statute
if
they
do
not
abide
by
the
statutory
time
sequence
of
first
adopting
the
plan
and
then
within
the
12-months
experiencing
this
event.
what
the
taxpayer’s
position
here
would
lead
to,
we
submit,
would
be
a
situation
where
taxpayers
suffering
destruction
of
insured
property
would
be
accorded
to
preference
of
a
taxpayer’s
suffering
a
sudden
condemnation
very
similar
to
what
happened
in
the
dwight
case.
now,
what
petitioner
attempts
to
distinguished
these
condemnation
cases,
it
says,
condemnation
creates
an
enforceable
obligation
to
pay
a
certain
amount
of
just
compensation
by
the
condemning
authority.
but,
the
destruction
of
its
insured
property
here
gave
rise,
so
it
says,
to
simply
a
conditional
or
contingent
claim.
but
what
are
these
contingencies
that
the
taxpayer
is
relying
upon
to
base
its
arguments
to
push
forward
to
this
positive
event
after
the
adoption
of
a
plan
in
there.
it
talks
about
the
filing
of
a
notice
of
loss,
it
talks
about
the
filing
of
a
proof
of
loss,
and
it
talks
about
other
proof
complying
with
other
procedural
requirements
under
the
contract
of
insurance.
but
the
record
here
indicates
that
these
procedural
requirements
had
already
been
met
by
petitioner
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
plan.
for
example,
a
record
indicates
here
that
negotiation
where
the
fire
started,
fire
was
on
september
10th,1965,
the
negotiations
that
the
petitioner
commenced
with
insurance
property
began
as
early
as
october
8,
1965.
in
fact,
petitioner’s
own
counsel
in
the
district
court,
testify
that
the
proof
of
loss
in
this
case
was
filed
prior
to
december
1965,
again
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
plan.
petitioner
does
not
meet
its
own
proposed
test,
and
that
is
the
test
proposed
by
the
district
court
in
kinney
case
on
which
it
relied.
but
in
any
event,
we
don’t
think
that
these
procedural
requirements
under
the
insurance
contract
create
the
claim
against
the
insurance
company
because
just
as
a
condemnation
taking
creates
the
claim
under
--
against
the
condemning
authority.
so
thus,
the
destructive
event
of
the
fire,
we
submit,
creates
the
claim
against
the
insurance
company.
but
as
this
irrevocable
event
of
either
taking
by
condemnation
or
by
fire,
which
converts
the
property
into
the
obligation
running
against
the
insurance
company
go
with
the
authority.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
don’t
think
it
should
make
any
difference,
mr.
justice
powell.
i
think
what
you
have
here
is
a
--
in
effect
an
irrevocable
transformation
of
property
from
a
property
which
exists
to
a
property
which
has
been
destroyed,
and
that
creates
in
the
case
--
of
your
case
of
negligence,
the
case
creates
an
obligation
on
the
on
the
common
law,
i
suppose
for
recompense,
which
will
not
elevate
it
to
a
contractual
claim
would
nevertheless
still
represent
the
claim
against
the
negligent
party.
i
don’t
think
that
should
make
a
difference.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
it
would
be
a
casualty
loss
to
the
corporation.
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
can
say
that
is
--
well,
it
would
be
a
casualty
and
loss
unless
it
was
covered
under
another
provision
section
1231
of
the
code,
which
provides
for
netting
of
losses
on
involuntary
conversions
against
gains
which
from
the
sale
of
capital
assets.
so,
i
don’t
think
i
could
answer
completely
that
that
would
be,
you
know,
an
ordinary
loss,
but
if
there
were
no
other
gains
presumably
it
would
be
an
ordinary
one.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
absent
such
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
right.
having
such
details
and
is
depreciation
of
the
kind.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
they
have
to
take
that
into
income.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
that’s
the
principle
--
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
if
we
are
on
a
12-month
plan
of
liquidation
at
the
time
of
the
recovery,
i
think
that
this
question
as
to
when
you
take
something
in
to
income
are
wholly
a
part
from
the
question
as
to
whether
the
plan
applies.
i
mean,
if
the
casualty
occurred
prior
to
the
law,
let’s
say
in
the
middle
of
the
plan
of
complete
liquidation
then
presumably,
if
that
were
a
loss,
that
would
be
an
uninsured
loss,
so
to
speak,
then
you
would
have
a
loss
that
wouldn’t
be
recognized.
isn’t
that
right?
because
it
would
carry
after
the
plan.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
so
then,
in
the
subsequent
year
when
you
get
money
into
income
since
you
have
not
deducted
that
loss,
presumably,
i
would
imagine
that
that
should
have
to
be
taken
into
income
since
i
can’t
think
of
any
reason
why
it
shouldn’t.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
yes,
well,
this
raises
a
question
as
to
whether
you
are
--
i
suppose
under
the
tax
benefit
rule,
if
you
had
not
got
any
tax
benefit
from
the
loss,
you
don’t
have
to
take
that
it
into
income.
i
was
imagining
it
would
be
only
the
net
of
the
loss,
i
think
that’s
right.
now,
we
think
that
this
subsequent
events
upon
which
petitioner
relies,
that
is
its
negotiations
with
the
insurance
company,
its
compliance
with
the
procedural
requirements
of
the
policy
simply
go
if
an
aid
of
the
collection
of
the
claim.
they
do
not
create
the
claim
against
the
insurance
company.
now,
while
the
taxpayer
recognizes
that
this
transaction
is
not
a
sale
here,
it
argues
that
into
its
reply
brief,
it
has
many
of
the
characteristics
of
a
sale.
what
it
says
in
effect
is
the
insurance
award
is
analogous
to
a
sales
price,
and
it
assumes
that
you
cannot
have
a
sale
without
a
determinable
sales
price.
well,
this
assumption
which
was
made
by
the
morton
opinion
as
well,
we
think
is
erroneous.
there
are
many
instances
where
you
can
have
a
sale
not
only
for
tax
purposes
but
for
any
purpose
without
the
existence
of
the
determinable
sales
prices.
for
example,
a
business
can
be
sold
for
a
percentage
of
future
profits
over
a
stated
period
of
time,
and
the
sales
price
in
that
situation
is
not
determinable
until
the
end
of
the
period.
but
no
one
would
doubt
it,
there
were
a
transfer
of
the
benefits
and
burdens
of
ownership
to
that
business,
that
there
was
a
sale,
clearly
a
sale
occurs
in
that
case.
and
to
that
extent,
we
think
that
the
petitioner’s
analogy
is
false.
alternatively,
the
taxpayer
argues
here
that
the
payment
by
the
insurance
company
could
be
a
sale.
it
talks
about
a
situation
where
the
insurance
company
will
pay
an
adjustment
for
salvage,
and
presumably
take
over
the
ownership
of
the
property.
now,
first
of
all,
there’s
no
showing
that
it
has
occurred
here,
it
didn’t
occur
here.
well,
this
payment
was
simply
compensation
for
a
loss,
but
even
if
there
was
--
even
in
such
a
situation,
we
think
that
the
compensation
for
the
loss
element
of
the
payment
would
not
be
analogous
to
a
sales
price,
so
to
speak,
because
that
simply
is
a
payment
for
a
decrease
in
value
of
the
damaged
property,
value
which
has
disappeared.
that
is
--
can
in
no
way,
be
analogize
to
an
element
of
the
payment
which
would
be
in
the
sales
price.
and
finally,
as
we
point
out
in
greater
detail
in
our
brief,
we
think
that
the
net
effect
of
the
petitioner’s
position
here
is
contrary
to
settled
rules
governing
the
holding
period
of
property.
almost
40
years
ago,
this
court
held
in
the
mcphee
case,
that
holding
period
--
the
concept
of
holding
period
is
coterminous
with
the
concept
of
ownership.
and,
as
corollary
to
those
cases,
there
are
other
cases
which
hold,
that
when
property
is
destroyed,
its
holding
period
ends.
now,
those
holdings
were
rendered
in
a
situations
involving
sunken
ships,
but
the
lesson
is
equally
instructive
here.
in
those
cases,
a
taxpayer
board
a
ship
on
january
1st
and
then
it
sunk
on
march
1st,
to
use
the
example.
the
insurance
proceeds
however
were
not
paid
until
july
15,
and
what
the
taxpayers
in
those
cases
argued
was
that
the
holding
period
--
their
holding
period
should
be
stretched
forward
beyond
six
months
to
the
point
where
the
insurance
proceeds
were
paid
and
in
that
way,
to
try
to
get
long
term
capital
gain.
now,
the
court
rejected
that
notion.
the
holding
period
ended
when
the
ship
sunk,
when
the
destructive
event
occur.
so,
we
think
that
the
--
we
think
that
those
holdings
are
instructive
as
to
the
error
that
petitioners
making
in
this
argument.
because
if
petitioner’s
argument
is
right
that
its
so
called
“sale”
under
the
statute
did
not
occur
until
the
insurance
proceeds
were
paid,
the
implication
of
its
argument
is
that
a
sale
occurred
long
before
after
its
coterminous
holding
period,
an
ownership
have
ended.
we
think
that’s
wrong
and
we
think
that
that’s
simply
another
demonstration
of
the
error
of
petitioner’s
position
and
the
reason
why
the
court’s
judgment
at
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
section
1033
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
and
then
the
property
was
sold?
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
i
presumably,
i
don’t
think
there
would
be
a
problem
because
what
you
got
there
is
simply
the
property
sold
after
the
adoption
of
the
plan.
the
fact
that
it
took
advantage
of
another
provision
of
the
internal
revenue
code
to
reconstruct
the
property,
and
get
a
carry
of
the
basis,
i
don’t
think
it
would
present
any
problem.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
substantially
the
same
result,
yes.
but
in
the
situation
you
posited,
i
think,
mr.
justice
powell,
that
the
statutory
time
sequence
in
section
337
is
observed
and
so
far
as
the
property
is
restore,
then
the
plan
is
adopted
and
then
the
property
is
sold.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
in
many
ways,
a
federal
tax
factor,
that
didn’t
occur
here.
mr.
stuart
a.
smith
well,
i
mean,
we
view
the
statutory
requirements
as
precise.
it
is
a
cliché
but
nevertheless,
a
somewhat
with
a
ring
of
truth
to
it
that
you
can’t
be
judged
for
federal
tax
purposes
on
the
basis
of
what
you
didn’t
or
what
they
didn’t
do
that
here.
i
have
nothing
further
to
say.
