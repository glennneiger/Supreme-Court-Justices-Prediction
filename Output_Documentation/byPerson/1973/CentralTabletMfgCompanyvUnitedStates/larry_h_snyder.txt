mr.
larry
h.
snyder
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
central
tablet
manufacturing
company
versus
the
united
states
is
an
income
tax
case
arising
under
section
337
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
section
337
provides
in
substance
that
sales
or
exchanges
by
a
corporation
within
a
12-month
period
following
adoption
of
a
plan
of
liquidation
shall
be
free
from
tax
to
the
corporation
provided
that
during
the
same
12-month
period,
all
of
the
assets
of
the
corporation
are
conveyed
or
transferred
to
stockholders
in
liquidation
of
the
corporation.
section
337
is
a
remedial
statute
enacted
in
1954
to
eliminate
the
need
for
determining
in
the
course
of
a
corporate
liquidation
whether
assets
are
sold
by
the
corporation
or
whether
instead,
they
are
sold
to
stockholders
following
distribution
of
the
assets
to
the
shareholders.
by
eliminating
this
determination,
the
statue
eliminates
the
tax
on
both
the
corporation
and
the
stockholders
with
the
same
sale
or
exchange
transaction.
in
the
series
of
lower
court
decision’s
following
the
enactment
of
337,
it
was
held
that
involuntary
conversions
by
a
casualty
ought
to
be
included
within
the
term
sales
or
exchanges
as
used
in
section
337.
these
decisions
were
subsequently
acquiesced
in
by
the
internal
revenue
service.
the
new
question
presented
here
by
central
tablet
is
whether
in
the
application
of
section
337
to
involuntary
conversions
by
a
casualty,
the
involuntary
conversion
occurs
at
the
time
of
the
casualty,
which
in
this
case
central
tablet
preceded
adoption
of
a
plan
of
liquidation
or
whether
it
occurs
on
the
right
to
insurance
proceeds
arises
which
under
the
facts
of
central
tablet
occurred
after
adoption
of
the
plan
of
liquidation.
briefly
stated
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
liability
was
neither
accepted
nor
rejected,
your
honor.
i
think
in
response
to
your
question
in
trying
to
state
it
fairly,
i
think
the
very
fact
that
we
negotiate
these
insurance
claims
was
a
recognition
tacitly
on
the
part
of
the
insurance
carriers
that
there
was
some
liability,
but
they
neither
admitted
nor
disallowed
liability.
they
did
however
reject
our
proofs
of
loss
in
the
case.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
i
don’t
know.
the
fire
had
occurred,
of
course.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
proofs
of
loss?
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
the
policy
had
been
issued,
the
proof
of
losses
have
been
rejected.
now
certainly,
this
is
a
condition
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
to
recovery
under
the
policy.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
i
think
that’s
correct.
there's
also
a
challenge
to
the
validity
of
the
policies
but
we
briefly
state
all
of
the
facts
that
i
think
are
necessary
for
the
court
to
understand,
the
factual
background
of
central
tablet.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
it
was
an
old
company,
the
building
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
no,
it’s
not
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
don’t
believe
so,
no.
i
don’t
know.
frankly,
i
don’t
recall
the
figures.
the
biggest
dispute
with
regard
to
the
building
policy
was
whether
or
not
a
coinsurance
clause
applied.
the
insurers
took
the
position
that
it,
did
had
it
applied
or
if
it
did
apply,
it
reduced
the
limit
of
coverage
approximately
40%.
now
this,
like
every
other
factual
issue
that
we
got
into
and
of
course
the
negotiations
was
never
determined.
what
finally
happened
is
we
started
to
talk
in
terms
of
numbers
and
agreed
on
a
dollar
amount.
but
in
addition
to
this,
of
course
there
was
the
usual
question
of
the
value
of
the
building
at
the
time
of
the
loss,
with
regard
to
the
personal
property
that
was
a
question
of
a
value
of
the
property.
of
course,
at
the
time
of
the
loss,
there
was
a
question
of
whether
some
of
the
personal
property
was
repairable.
there
was
even
a
question
with
regard
with
part
of
the
machinery
and
equipment,
whether
the
damage
to
it
had
been
caused
by
the
fire
and
the
water
that
had
been
used
to
put
out
the
fire,
or
whether
instead
it
had
been
caused
by
the
elements
and
the
failure
of
the
insurer
to
properly
take
care
of
that
equipment
after
the
fire.
this
was
not
a
great
bone
of
contention.
and
i
don’t
--
i
can’t
tell
you
how
many
percentage-wise
the
number
of
machines
it
involved,
but
it
was
a
question.
here
again,
it
was
never
sudden.
it
was
never
decided
that
the
insurer
was
or
was
not
at
fault.
we
finally
agreed
on
numbers
and
on
dollars.
the
negotiations
of
these
claims
took
some
two
years.
the
building
claim
took
approximately
nine
months
to
reach
a
settlement.
settlement
was
after
adoption
of
the
plan
of
liquidation.
the
personal
property
tax
claims
were
settled
approximately
a
year
after
the
fire.
the
business
interruption
loss
claim,
which
is
not
here
in
contention,
was
two
years
after
the
fire
before
it
was
--
before
it
was
settled.
but
the
length
of
the
negotiations
were
lengthy
as
indicated
by
that
time
span
and
they
were
quite
intense,
and
there
were
a
number
of
questions
that
arose.
and
to
repeat
my
statement
on
answering
your
question
before,
there
was
never
any
admission
of
liability
on
the
part
of
the
insurers.
neither
did
they
specifically
deny
it
except
that
they
did
reject
our
proofs
of
loss.
the
question
that’s
raised
by
central
tablet
was
of
course
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
case
of
united
states
v.
morton,
an
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals’
decision
decided
in
1968
in
which
morton
which
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
eight
circuit
held
that
insurance
proceeds
received
after
adoption
of
the
plan
of
liquidation
as
a
result
of
a
fire
occurring
before
that
plan
of
liquidation
were
entitled
of
a
non-recognition
provisions
of
section
337.
the
circuit
of
appeals
judgment
in
this
case
in
central
tablet
is
of
course
directly
in
conflict
with
morton.
it
also
conflicts
with
kinney
v.
the
united
states,
which
is
a
district
court
case
in
california
which
held
that
in
that
case,
the
acceptance
by
the
insurance
carriers
on
the
insured’s
proof
of
loss
was
the
time
for
the
completion
of
the
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty
and
the
court
further
held
that
section
337
applied
to
that
case,
and
that
the
taxpayer
was
there
too
entitled
to
the
remedial
provisions
of
section
337.
despite
morton
and
kinney,
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
as
held
that
for
the
purposes
of
the
application
of
section
337
an
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty
occurs
in
every
case
at
the
time
of
the
casualty
because
this
is
the
position
of
the
government
here.
it’s
the
position
of
the
government
that
an
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty
is
a
single
destructive
act.
it’s
the
contrary
position
of
central
tablet
that
and
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty
is
not
a
single
destructive
act
but
is
instead
a
transaction
which
is
complete
for
the
purpose
of
the
application
for
337
when
an
unenforceable
right
to
insurance
proceeds
arises,
that’s
our
further
position
that
under
the
facts
of
central
tablet,
that
occurred
when
the
insurance
carriers
accepted
our
proofs
of
loss.
this
of
course
is
exertedly
occurred
following
adoption
of
the
plan
of
liquidation
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
it
was.
the
record
does
not
show
that
but
it
was
--
i
don’t
believe
it
was
--
but
it
was
in
fact
an
important
determination
of
the
liquidation.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
do
not
think
i
can
go
that
far
because
at
the
time
of
the
fire
and
at
the
time
all
these
happened,
central
tablet
was
in
the
throes
of
a
strike
and
this
may
have
incidentally,
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
extended
the
problem
with
the
business
interruption
loss,
because
we
had
to
then
determine
when
the
strike
might
have
ended
had
there
not
been
a
fire
in
order
to
term
--
to
determine
the
period
of
business
interruption.
so
that
entered
into
the
picture,
but
no,
i
can’t
see
that.
i
think
there’s
no
question
but
that.
the
fact
of
the
fire
was
an
important
element
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
corporation
was
eventually
--
it
was
to
go
on
a
business,
but
it
was
not
the
only
fact.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
i
think
that
the
government’s
position
is
factual
as
i
understand
it.
but
the
time
of
an
involuntary
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
its
always
at
the
time
of
the
casualty.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
where
the
government
comes
out,
yes.
but
i
suppose
that
they
better
speak
to
that.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
it
is
not
indistinguishable
factually
in
that
in
morton,
the
taxpayer
was
at
cash,
and
the
cash
basis
in
the
central
tablet,
we
are
on
accrual
basis.
but
i
think
that
the
reasoning
of
morton
applies
here
that
i
think
that
morton
was
correctly
decided
on
the
basis
of
a
cash
basis
taxpayer.
i
think
that
morton
might
have,
having
the
case
of
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer
as
central
tablet
might
conclude
that
central
tablet
would
have
to
report.
of
course
now,
we’re
talking
about
337
and
were
--
but
for
the
purposes
of
accounting
that
the
accrual
was
at
the
time
that
the
proofs
of
loss
of
central
tablet
were
accepted
by
the
insurers
rather
than
as
withheld,
in
that
case,
that
it
wasn’t
until
receipt
of
the
proceeds
of
insurance
that
it
was
even
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
i
suppose.
in
fairness,
it
is
except
that
i
think
under
the
facts
of
central
tablet
is
distinguished
of
the
--
distinguished
from
the
facts
of
morton
and
the
facts
of
kinney,
i
think
we
have
the
easier
case.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
i
think
you
could
--
i
think
you
could
come
to
that
conclusion,
yes,
because
i
think
with
that
time,
and
enforceable
right
to
insurance
proceeds
occurs
and
i
think
probably
at
that
time,
you
could
also
determine
that
the
amount
is
reasonably
determined.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
i
don’t
think
so.
no,
that’s
not
my
understanding
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
think
it
is,
yes.
i
think
it
is.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
the
condemnation
cases
of
course
are
the
cases
that
the
government
relies
heavily
on.
frankly,
i
think
they
misplaced
reliance
on
the
condemnation
cases.
all
of
the
cases
they
cite
and
all
of
the
cases
that
are
litigated
of
course,
are
those
cases
which
occur
under
the
quick
take
statutes
or
in
jurisdictions
in
which
it
is
held
that
the
takes
occurs
at
the
preliminary
filing
of
the
declaration
of
condemnation
or
whatever
it
might
be.
i
think
if
you
examine
the
majority
of
statutes
or
the
majority
of
jurisdictions,
you’ll
see
that
the
take
doesn’t
occur
normally
until
there’s
a
deposit
made
in
court
or
until
it
sometimes,
there’s
an
actual
--
a
decree
or
a
verdict.
and
i
think
when
you
analyze
those
condemnation
cases
against
this
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty,
you
will
see
that
the
take
is
the
significant
part
in
the
condemnation
case
because
it
is
at
that
time
that
the
right
to
compensation
arises,
and
that’s
the
basis
of
holding
that
it’s
the
time
of
taking
that
a
condemnation
occurs.
if
you
look
at
the
similar
event,
an
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty,
i
believe
you
have
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
that’s
going
to
be
comparatively
when
the
right
to
insurance
proceeds
arises.
and
we
submit
of
course
and
it’s
the
basis
of
our
case
that
that
does
not
occur
until
at
least
the
proofs
of
loss
are
accepted
by
the
insurer.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
what
most
jurisdictions,
your
honor.
there
are
a
number
of
statutes,
some
of
which
the
filing
of
the
complaint
or
the
petition
will
--
is
held
to
be
the
time
of
the
taking
for
the
purposes
of
entry
in
the
right
of
the
government
to
take
possession.
there
are
other
statutes
however
--
there
are
other
statutes
in
which
the
time
of
the
take
is
not
in
term
of
deposit.
a
deposit
is
placed
in
court
by
the
condemnor.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
no,
he
receives
notice
but
there
is
no
hearing
on
the
--
there’s
no
preliminary
hearing.
there
is
a
statutory
procedure
whereby
you
can
challenge
the
power
of
the
authority
or
the
authority
of
the
condemnor
to
institute
this
proceeding,
but
that’s
after
the
take.
i
suppose
it
would
be
likened
if
that
procedure
were
utilized,
it
would
be
likened
to
have
sort
of
a
condition
subsequent
to
the
take.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
the
estate’s
estimate
of
the
value
is
always
deposited,
yes.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
but
very
rarely
of
course,
do
they,
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
substance
in
effect.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
assume
so.
yes,
pretty
i’m
not
sure.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
don’t
believe
so.
no,
i
think
if
you
take
it
down,
that
ends
the
question
of
the
reasonable
value
of
the
property
which
has
been
taken
by
the
condemning
authority.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
no,
because
i
think
that
like
the
state,
to
my
knowledge
is
that
they’re
under
federal
law,
there
are
a
number
of
statutory
procedures,
one
or
two
of
which
are
quick
take
in
which
at
the
time
of
--
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don’t
even
think
you
have
to
file
a
court
proceeding.
what
i
think
at
the
time
of
the
take,
which
is
at
the
--
almost
the
earliest
point
of
the
condemnation,
the
right
to
compensation
arises.
but
you
could
say
that
basis
that
you
can
justify
these
quick
take
statutes
as
i
read
the
decisions
of
this
court
with
some
basic
concept
of
constitutional
law,
i
think
the
right
has
to
arise
then
where
the
statute
is
not
invalidly
applied.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
to
summarize
central
tablet
versus
the
united
states.
the
question
is
whether
an
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty
for
the
purposes
of
the
application
of
section
337
occurs
at
the
point
of
the
casualty
which
in
this
case
preceded
the
doctrine
of
the
plan
liquidation,
or
whether
instead
it
occurs
at
the
point
that
a
non-conditional
obligation
to
pay
insurance
proceeds
on
the
part
of
the
insurance
carriers
arises,
which
in
this
case
post-dated
adoption
of
the
plan
of
liquidation.
i
stated
yesterday,
it’s
the
position
of
the
government
that
an
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty
for
the
purposes
of
the
application
on
section
337
occurs
in
every
case
at
the
point
of
the
casualty,
and
that
an
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty
is
a
single
destructive
event.
it’s
our
contrary
position
that
an
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty
is
a
gain
or
loss
producing
transaction.
and
that
the
purposes
of
section
337,
that
transaction
is
complete
on
an
enforceable
right
to
ensure
its
proceeds
arises.
we
submit
that
the
casualty
is
much
like
an
executory
contract
of
sale.
in
an
executory
contract
of
sale
by
treasury
regulation,
it
is
distinguished
from
a
contract
of
sale.
a
contract
of
sale
in
turn
is
defined
as
a
contract
in
which
there
is
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
buyer
to
buy,
and
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
seller
to
sell.
and,
if
it
is
not
until
there
those
obligations
with
the
sale
under
treasury
regulation
is
complete
for
the
purposes
of
the
application
of
section
337.
and,
we
submit
that
the
comparable
event,
the
taxable
event
to
that
sale
is
an
involuntary
conversion
when
enforceable
right
to
proceeds
arises.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
what
difference
this
makes
in
this
case,
are
you
talking
about
dollar
difference?
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
it
makes
approximately
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
two
taxes.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
there
would
be
two
taxes,
one
on
the
corporation
and
one
on
the
stockholders.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
don’t
know
of
here.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
oh!
yes,
it
would
be
at
the
regular
corporate
rate.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
would
be
vary
depending
on
their
shares,
but
yes,
that’s
the
difference.
i
thought
you
were
asking
about
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
in
other
words,
there
will
be
two
taxes,
one
on
the
corporation
and
factor
has
been
on
tax
of
the
corporation,
this
is
a
refund.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
that
was
$80,000.00,
now
some
part
of
that
was
a
business
interruption
in
charge
with
the
question
which
it
is
not
before
this
court,
it
was
not
taken
on
appeal,
but
i
would
say
approximately
$70,000.00
is
in
issue
here,
and
that’s
the
tax
to
the
corporation
which
was
paid
under
protest.
and
of
course
there
is
a
tax
due
that
the
time
of
a
liquidation
of
the
assets
in
the
distribution
of
those
assets
to
the
stockholders.
this
is
of
course
a
point
that
has
already
been
complete.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
it’s
a
remedial
provision.
i
think
the
purpose
is
to
eliminate
this
kind
of
double
tax
in
the
situation
in
which
there’s
a
single
really
gain
or
loss
producing
transaction.
we’re
talking
about
the
gains.
you
have
the
same
gain
producing
track
transaction.
i
think
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
eliminate
a
tax
from
that
single
transaction
on
both
the
corporation
and
the
stockholders
when
distribution
is
made
in
liquidation
within
the
period
of
12
months.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
how
does
it
give
weight
or
force
to
that
purpose?
well,
because
under
the
facts
of
this
case
it
would
clearly
fall
within
that.
there
would
be
a
tax
on
the
corporation
and
a
tax
on
the
stockholder.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
the
casualty
happened,
yes.
but
i
distinguish
between
the
casualty
and
an
involuntary
conversion.
well,
i
think,
the
statutes
in
treasury
regulations
distinguish
between
a
casualty
loss
and
an
involuntary
conversion.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
because
i
can
do
no
more
than
repeat
my
attempt
to
an
answer
before
which
is
that
this
is
the
same
kind
of
transaction.
the
337
was
obviously
on
the
surface
designed
to
meet
what
is
the
difference
between
a
casualty
and
on
executory
contract
of
sale.
the
only
difference
is
its
thrust
upon
this
taxpayer,
he
has
no
choice
or
it
has
no
choice.
in
an
ordinary
sale
or
an
exchange,
the
taxpayer
can
take
his
own
time
in
maneuvering
negotiate,
and
then
still
has
the
remedial
of
fact
of
section
377,
that
on
an
equity
basis,
i
think
it’s
more
equitable
to
include
an
involuntary
conversion
by
casualties
or
this
ordinary
sale.
mr.
chief
justice
i
would
like
to
resume
on
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
briefly
--
counsel
professed
his
argument
with
a
reference
to
the
strict
time
sequence
required
by
the
statute,
and
he
also
this
argument
largely
in
the
same
vein.
and
with
that
in
mind,
i
would
like
to
read
treasury
of
regulation
14437-2a
which
says,
“in
ascertaining
whether
a
sale
or
exchange
occurs
on
or
after
the
date
in
which
the
plan
of
complete
liquidation
has
adopted
the
fact
that
negotiations
were
sale
may
have
been
commenced
either
by
the
corporation
or
insurer.”
all
of
those
are
both
shall
be
disregarded.
moreover,
in
executory
contract
to
sell
is
to
be
distinguished
from
the
contract
of
sale.
ordinarily,
a
sale
has
not
occurred
when
a
contract
to
sell
has
been
entered
into
but
title
and
possession
of
the
property
have
not
been
transferred.
and
this
is
the
strict
time
sequence
that
counsel
refers
to.
the
government
is
committed
to
the
proposition
because
it
acquiesce
by
revenue
ruling
in
it
that
an
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty
is
of
sale
or
exchange,
so
it
has
to
be
treated
that
way,
but
they
want
to
treat
it
differently.
they
want
to
treat
it
differently
from
a
sale.
they
want
to
treat
it
as
a
single
destructive
event
which
it
is
not.
the
whole
thrust,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
income
taxes
is
directed
to
the
realization
of
gain
or
loss.
in
a
transaction
which
produces
gain
is
not
complete
until
this
is
some
enforceable
right
to
gain,
and
that
doesn’t
occur
here.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
we
still
have
that
in
the
event
that
this
decision
is
affirmed,
it
will
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
goes
through
that.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
i
know
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
right.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
it
is
saying
that
the
gain
was
realized
in
65
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
that’s
right.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
that
is
in
the
year
of
the
fire,
and
we
have
that
--
we
have
that
question
as
to
business
interruption
insurance.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
it
is
a
question
of
the
time
of
the
accrual,
is
it
not?
and
we
litigated
that
question
on
the
government
draft
that
i
think
in
all
fairness,
it
drafted
because
it
did
not
want
to
cloud
this
rather
narrow
issue,
but
there
has
been
a
tax
court
case
since
which
is
held
the
business
interruption
insurance
to
the
time
of
the
recovery
of
the
insurance
is
the
time
that
it
is
reported
that
i
doesn’t
relate
back.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
whereas
the
other
cases
that
indicated
what
year
that
a
gain
that
there
should
be
realized,
let
us
forget
the
liquidation.
well,
let
us
take
lucas
versus
north
texas
lumber
company.
you
know
that,
that
was
an
action
of
purchased
timberland
and
it
was
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
you
know
fire
case
and
casualty
loss.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
the
nearest
thing
that
i
have
but
i
cannot
say
it
to
you
or
i
think
it
is
the
nearest
thing,
justice
white
is
helvering
versus
hamel
which
is
cited
somewhere
either
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
our
brief,
and
that
was
a
foreclosure
sale.
and
they
said,
this
court
said
that
the
sale
was
not
reportable
at
the
time
of
decree
for
foreclosure.
but,
in
the
following
year
when
the
sale
actually
took
place,
that
was
the
decision
of
this
court
as
to
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer,
and
i
think
that
situation
is
similarly
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
no
question
about
that
in
my
mind
and
i
think
this
case
that
i
have
cited,
i
cannot
cite
you
a
higher
case
or
casualty
at
hand.
but
i
think
this
line
of
cases
lucas
versus
north
texas
lumber
company
which
is
also
cited
somewhere
in
the
briefs,
helvering
versus
hamel,
they
all
hold
to
this
effect.
that
is
at
the
time
that
an
obligation
arises
even
if
it
as
to
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer
that
the
gain
is
reported
and
not
at
the
time
of
the
incident
whether
it
be
a
casualty
or
the
exercise
of
an
option,
or
a
foreclosure
sale
on
the
petitioner’s
file.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
the
condemnation
occurs
of
course
at
the
time
of
the
taking,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
the
only
difference
is
on
the
cases
that
the
government
cites
are
under
we
talked
about
and
discussed
yesterday
are
in
those
statute.
those
peculiar
in
the
minority,
i
mean,
fewer
statutes,
i’m
sure.
let’s
say,
under
particular
statutes
that
at
the
time
the
declaration
is
filed,
the
government
has
the
right
to
possession
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
that
is
the
taking.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
but
under
a
majority
of
statutes,
that
does
not
happen
until
the
deposit
is
put
up
or
until
the
decree
is
put
up,
and
then
that
taking
occurs.
but
when
you
compare
an
involuntary
conversion
in
those
cases,
you
see,
it
is
not
the
casualty
itself;
it’s
the
creation
of
the
right
to
the
obligation
that
compares
to
the
taking
and
this
occurred
in
this
case
after
the
adoption
of
the
plan
of
liquidation.
thank
you.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i’m
sure
there
is
but
i
cannot
cite
you
by
name
and
report
number
of
the
case.
we
did
--
this
was
involved
in
the
district
court
and
we
prevailed
there,
and
it
was
not
taken
to
the
court
of
bills
by
the
government.
i
think
in
all
fairness
for
the
reason
that
i
just
said
to
you,
i
don’t
think
they
want
to
cloud
up
this
issue.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
decision
was
handed
down
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
and
before
we
could
file
our
petition,
the
government
filed
a
motion
in
the
district
court
to
consider
this
very
question.
so,
i
say
that
if
we
lose
here,
we’re
going
back
to
the
district
court
to
argue
that
question,
i
have
no
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
the
question
of
when
this
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
in
which
year,
and
i
don’t
have
any
doubts
as
to
how
it
is
going
to
come
out,
i
think
we’re
going
to
prevail,
but
nevertheless,
they
haven’t
given
up
on
this
question.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
it’s
relevant
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
time
of
accrual,
the
time
of
accrual,
yes,
i
think
it
is
but
i
think
that
the
true
concur
in
this
case.
i
think
that
the
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty
concurs
with
the
accrual
of
the
right
to
receive
insurance
proceeds.
so,
it’s
important
to
that
extent,
yes.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
think
that
the
court’s
body
had
but
there
is
--
if
i
say
again
or
repeat,
if
we
lose
here
then
we
do
have
--
the
government
has
not
abandoned
that
point.
and
of
course,
holding
that
these
proceeds
or
entitle
a
man
recognition,
the
court
--
the
district
court
was
not
presented
then
with
the
question
of
when
are
these
proceeds
report.
so,
it’s
a
--
as
i
say
it
hinges
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
as
to
whether
that’s
litigated.
thank
you.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
central
tablet
manufacturing
company
versus
the
united
states
is
an
income
tax
case
arising
under
section
337
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
section
337
provides
in
substance
that
sales
or
exchanges
by
a
corporation
within
a
12-month
period
following
adoption
of
a
plan
of
liquidation
shall
be
free
from
tax
to
the
corporation
provided
that
during
the
same
12-month
period,
all
of
the
assets
of
the
corporation
are
conveyed
or
transferred
to
stockholders
in
liquidation
of
the
corporation.
section
337
is
a
remedial
statute
enacted
in
1954
to
eliminate
the
need
for
determining
in
the
course
of
a
corporate
liquidation
whether
assets
are
sold
by
the
corporation
or
whether
instead,
they
are
sold
to
stockholders
following
distribution
of
the
assets
to
the
shareholders.
by
eliminating
this
determination,
the
statue
eliminates
the
tax
on
both
the
corporation
and
the
stockholders
with
the
same
sale
or
exchange
transaction.
in
the
series
of
lower
court
decision’s
following
the
enactment
of
337,
it
was
held
that
involuntary
conversions
by
a
casualty
ought
to
be
included
within
the
term
sales
or
exchanges
as
used
in
section
337.
these
decisions
were
subsequently
acquiesced
in
by
the
internal
revenue
service.
the
new
question
presented
here
by
central
tablet
is
whether
in
the
application
of
section
337
to
involuntary
conversions
by
a
casualty,
the
involuntary
conversion
occurs
at
the
time
of
the
casualty,
which
in
this
case
central
tablet
preceded
adoption
of
a
plan
of
liquidation
or
whether
it
occurs
on
the
right
to
insurance
proceeds
arises
which
under
the
facts
of
central
tablet
occurred
after
adoption
of
the
plan
of
liquidation.
briefly
stated
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
liability
was
neither
accepted
nor
rejected,
your
honor.
i
think
in
response
to
your
question
in
trying
to
state
it
fairly,
i
think
the
very
fact
that
we
negotiate
these
insurance
claims
was
a
recognition
tacitly
on
the
part
of
the
insurance
carriers
that
there
was
some
liability,
but
they
neither
admitted
nor
disallowed
liability.
they
did
however
reject
our
proofs
of
loss
in
the
case.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
i
don’t
know.
the
fire
had
occurred,
of
course.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
proofs
of
loss?
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
the
policy
had
been
issued,
the
proof
of
losses
have
been
rejected.
now
certainly,
this
is
a
condition
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
to
recovery
under
the
policy.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
i
think
that’s
correct.
there's
also
a
challenge
to
the
validity
of
the
policies
but
we
briefly
state
all
of
the
facts
that
i
think
are
necessary
for
the
court
to
understand,
the
factual
background
of
central
tablet.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
it
was
an
old
company,
the
building
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
no,
it’s
not
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
don’t
believe
so,
no.
i
don’t
know.
frankly,
i
don’t
recall
the
figures.
the
biggest
dispute
with
regard
to
the
building
policy
was
whether
or
not
a
coinsurance
clause
applied.
the
insurers
took
the
position
that
it,
did
had
it
applied
or
if
it
did
apply,
it
reduced
the
limit
of
coverage
approximately
40%.
now
this,
like
every
other
factual
issue
that
we
got
into
and
of
course
the
negotiations
was
never
determined.
what
finally
happened
is
we
started
to
talk
in
terms
of
numbers
and
agreed
on
a
dollar
amount.
but
in
addition
to
this,
of
course
there
was
the
usual
question
of
the
value
of
the
building
at
the
time
of
the
loss,
with
regard
to
the
personal
property
that
was
a
question
of
a
value
of
the
property.
of
course,
at
the
time
of
the
loss,
there
was
a
question
of
whether
some
of
the
personal
property
was
repairable.
there
was
even
a
question
with
regard
with
part
of
the
machinery
and
equipment,
whether
the
damage
to
it
had
been
caused
by
the
fire
and
the
water
that
had
been
used
to
put
out
the
fire,
or
whether
instead
it
had
been
caused
by
the
elements
and
the
failure
of
the
insurer
to
properly
take
care
of
that
equipment
after
the
fire.
this
was
not
a
great
bone
of
contention.
and
i
don’t
--
i
can’t
tell
you
how
many
percentage-wise
the
number
of
machines
it
involved,
but
it
was
a
question.
here
again,
it
was
never
sudden.
it
was
never
decided
that
the
insurer
was
or
was
not
at
fault.
we
finally
agreed
on
numbers
and
on
dollars.
the
negotiations
of
these
claims
took
some
two
years.
the
building
claim
took
approximately
nine
months
to
reach
a
settlement.
settlement
was
after
adoption
of
the
plan
of
liquidation.
the
personal
property
tax
claims
were
settled
approximately
a
year
after
the
fire.
the
business
interruption
loss
claim,
which
is
not
here
in
contention,
was
two
years
after
the
fire
before
it
was
--
before
it
was
settled.
but
the
length
of
the
negotiations
were
lengthy
as
indicated
by
that
time
span
and
they
were
quite
intense,
and
there
were
a
number
of
questions
that
arose.
and
to
repeat
my
statement
on
answering
your
question
before,
there
was
never
any
admission
of
liability
on
the
part
of
the
insurers.
neither
did
they
specifically
deny
it
except
that
they
did
reject
our
proofs
of
loss.
the
question
that’s
raised
by
central
tablet
was
of
course
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
case
of
united
states
v.
morton,
an
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals’
decision
decided
in
1968
in
which
morton
which
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
eight
circuit
held
that
insurance
proceeds
received
after
adoption
of
the
plan
of
liquidation
as
a
result
of
a
fire
occurring
before
that
plan
of
liquidation
were
entitled
of
a
non-recognition
provisions
of
section
337.
the
circuit
of
appeals
judgment
in
this
case
in
central
tablet
is
of
course
directly
in
conflict
with
morton.
it
also
conflicts
with
kinney
v.
the
united
states,
which
is
a
district
court
case
in
california
which
held
that
in
that
case,
the
acceptance
by
the
insurance
carriers
on
the
insured’s
proof
of
loss
was
the
time
for
the
completion
of
the
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty
and
the
court
further
held
that
section
337
applied
to
that
case,
and
that
the
taxpayer
was
there
too
entitled
to
the
remedial
provisions
of
section
337.
despite
morton
and
kinney,
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
as
held
that
for
the
purposes
of
the
application
of
section
337
an
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty
occurs
in
every
case
at
the
time
of
the
casualty
because
this
is
the
position
of
the
government
here.
it’s
the
position
of
the
government
that
an
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty
is
a
single
destructive
act.
it’s
the
contrary
position
of
central
tablet
that
and
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty
is
not
a
single
destructive
act
but
is
instead
a
transaction
which
is
complete
for
the
purpose
of
the
application
for
337
when
an
unenforceable
right
to
insurance
proceeds
arises,
that’s
our
further
position
that
under
the
facts
of
central
tablet,
that
occurred
when
the
insurance
carriers
accepted
our
proofs
of
loss.
this
of
course
is
exertedly
occurred
following
adoption
of
the
plan
of
liquidation
in
this
case.
we
submit
that
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
it
was.
the
record
does
not
show
that
but
it
was
--
i
don’t
believe
it
was
--
but
it
was
in
fact
an
important
determination
of
the
liquidation.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
do
not
think
i
can
go
that
far
because
at
the
time
of
the
fire
and
at
the
time
all
these
happened,
central
tablet
was
in
the
throes
of
a
strike
and
this
may
have
incidentally,
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
that
extended
the
problem
with
the
business
interruption
loss,
because
we
had
to
then
determine
when
the
strike
might
have
ended
had
there
not
been
a
fire
in
order
to
term
--
to
determine
the
period
of
business
interruption.
so
that
entered
into
the
picture,
but
no,
i
can’t
see
that.
i
think
there’s
no
question
but
that.
the
fact
of
the
fire
was
an
important
element
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
corporation
was
eventually
--
it
was
to
go
on
a
business,
but
it
was
not
the
only
fact.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
i
think
that
the
government’s
position
is
factual
as
i
understand
it.
but
the
time
of
an
involuntary
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
its
always
at
the
time
of
the
casualty.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
it
seems
to
me
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
where
the
government
comes
out,
yes.
but
i
suppose
that
they
better
speak
to
that.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
it
is
not
indistinguishable
factually
in
that
in
morton,
the
taxpayer
was
at
cash,
and
the
cash
basis
in
the
central
tablet,
we
are
on
accrual
basis.
but
i
think
that
the
reasoning
of
morton
applies
here
that
i
think
that
morton
was
correctly
decided
on
the
basis
of
a
cash
basis
taxpayer.
i
think
that
morton
might
have,
having
the
case
of
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer
as
central
tablet
might
conclude
that
central
tablet
would
have
to
report.
of
course
now,
we’re
talking
about
337
and
were
--
but
for
the
purposes
of
accounting
that
the
accrual
was
at
the
time
that
the
proofs
of
loss
of
central
tablet
were
accepted
by
the
insurers
rather
than
as
withheld,
in
that
case,
that
it
wasn’t
until
receipt
of
the
proceeds
of
insurance
that
it
was
even
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
i
suppose.
in
fairness,
it
is
except
that
i
think
under
the
facts
of
central
tablet
is
distinguished
of
the
--
distinguished
from
the
facts
of
morton
and
the
facts
of
kinney,
i
think
we
have
the
easier
case.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
i
think
you
could
--
i
think
you
could
come
to
that
conclusion,
yes,
because
i
think
with
that
time,
and
enforceable
right
to
insurance
proceeds
occurs
and
i
think
probably
at
that
time,
you
could
also
determine
that
the
amount
is
reasonably
determined.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
i
don’t
think
so.
no,
that’s
not
my
understanding
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
think
it
is,
yes.
i
think
it
is.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
the
condemnation
cases
of
course
are
the
cases
that
the
government
relies
heavily
on.
frankly,
i
think
they
misplaced
reliance
on
the
condemnation
cases.
all
of
the
cases
they
cite
and
all
of
the
cases
that
are
litigated
of
course,
are
those
cases
which
occur
under
the
quick
take
statutes
or
in
jurisdictions
in
which
it
is
held
that
the
takes
occurs
at
the
preliminary
filing
of
the
declaration
of
condemnation
or
whatever
it
might
be.
i
think
if
you
examine
the
majority
of
statutes
or
the
majority
of
jurisdictions,
you’ll
see
that
the
take
doesn’t
occur
normally
until
there’s
a
deposit
made
in
court
or
until
it
sometimes,
there’s
an
actual
--
a
decree
or
a
verdict.
and
i
think
when
you
analyze
those
condemnation
cases
against
this
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty,
you
will
see
that
the
take
is
the
significant
part
in
the
condemnation
case
because
it
is
at
that
time
that
the
right
to
compensation
arises,
and
that’s
the
basis
of
holding
that
it’s
the
time
of
taking
that
a
condemnation
occurs.
if
you
look
at
the
similar
event,
an
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty,
i
believe
you
have
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
that’s
going
to
be
comparatively
when
the
right
to
insurance
proceeds
arises.
and
we
submit
of
course
and
it’s
the
basis
of
our
case
that
that
does
not
occur
until
at
least
the
proofs
of
loss
are
accepted
by
the
insurer.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
what
most
jurisdictions,
your
honor.
there
are
a
number
of
statutes,
some
of
which
the
filing
of
the
complaint
or
the
petition
will
--
is
held
to
be
the
time
of
the
taking
for
the
purposes
of
entry
in
the
right
of
the
government
to
take
possession.
there
are
other
statutes
however
--
there
are
other
statutes
in
which
the
time
of
the
take
is
not
in
term
of
deposit.
a
deposit
is
placed
in
court
by
the
condemnor.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
no,
he
receives
notice
but
there
is
no
hearing
on
the
--
there’s
no
preliminary
hearing.
there
is
a
statutory
procedure
whereby
you
can
challenge
the
power
of
the
authority
or
the
authority
of
the
condemnor
to
institute
this
proceeding,
but
that’s
after
the
take.
i
suppose
it
would
be
likened
if
that
procedure
were
utilized,
it
would
be
likened
to
have
sort
of
a
condition
subsequent
to
the
take.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
the
estate’s
estimate
of
the
value
is
always
deposited,
yes.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
but
very
rarely
of
course,
do
they,
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
substance
in
effect.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
assume
so.
yes,
pretty
i’m
not
sure.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
don’t
believe
so.
no,
i
think
if
you
take
it
down,
that
ends
the
question
of
the
reasonable
value
of
the
property
which
has
been
taken
by
the
condemning
authority.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
no,
because
i
think
that
like
the
state,
to
my
knowledge
is
that
they’re
under
federal
law,
there
are
a
number
of
statutory
procedures,
one
or
two
of
which
are
quick
take
in
which
at
the
time
of
--
a
matter
of
fact,
i
don’t
even
think
you
have
to
file
a
court
proceeding.
what
i
think
at
the
time
of
the
take,
which
is
at
the
--
almost
the
earliest
point
of
the
condemnation,
the
right
to
compensation
arises.
but
you
could
say
that
basis
that
you
can
justify
these
quick
take
statutes
as
i
read
the
decisions
of
this
court
with
some
basic
concept
of
constitutional
law,
i
think
the
right
has
to
arise
then
where
the
statute
is
not
invalidly
applied.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
thank
you,
sir.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
to
summarize
central
tablet
versus
the
united
states.
the
question
is
whether
an
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty
for
the
purposes
of
the
application
of
section
337
occurs
at
the
point
of
the
casualty
which
in
this
case
preceded
the
doctrine
of
the
plan
liquidation,
or
whether
instead
it
occurs
at
the
point
that
a
non-conditional
obligation
to
pay
insurance
proceeds
on
the
part
of
the
insurance
carriers
arises,
which
in
this
case
post-dated
adoption
of
the
plan
of
liquidation.
i
stated
yesterday,
it’s
the
position
of
the
government
that
an
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty
for
the
purposes
of
the
application
on
section
337
occurs
in
every
case
at
the
point
of
the
casualty,
and
that
an
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty
is
a
single
destructive
event.
it’s
our
contrary
position
that
an
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty
is
a
gain
or
loss
producing
transaction.
and
that
the
purposes
of
section
337,
that
transaction
is
complete
on
an
enforceable
right
to
ensure
its
proceeds
arises.
we
submit
that
the
casualty
is
much
like
an
executory
contract
of
sale.
in
an
executory
contract
of
sale
by
treasury
regulation,
it
is
distinguished
from
a
contract
of
sale.
a
contract
of
sale
in
turn
is
defined
as
a
contract
in
which
there
is
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
buyer
to
buy,
and
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
seller
to
sell.
and,
if
it
is
not
until
there
those
obligations
with
the
sale
under
treasury
regulation
is
complete
for
the
purposes
of
the
application
of
section
337.
and,
we
submit
that
the
comparable
event,
the
taxable
event
to
that
sale
is
an
involuntary
conversion
when
enforceable
right
to
proceeds
arises.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
what
difference
this
makes
in
this
case,
are
you
talking
about
dollar
difference?
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
it
makes
approximately
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
two
taxes.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
there
would
be
two
taxes,
one
on
the
corporation
and
one
on
the
stockholders.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
don’t
know
of
here.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
oh!
yes,
it
would
be
at
the
regular
corporate
rate.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
would
be
vary
depending
on
their
shares,
but
yes,
that’s
the
difference.
i
thought
you
were
asking
about
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
in
other
words,
there
will
be
two
taxes,
one
on
the
corporation
and
factor
has
been
on
tax
of
the
corporation,
this
is
a
refund.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
that
was
$80,000.00,
now
some
part
of
that
was
a
business
interruption
in
charge
with
the
question
which
it
is
not
before
this
court,
it
was
not
taken
on
appeal,
but
i
would
say
approximately
$70,000.00
is
in
issue
here,
and
that’s
the
tax
to
the
corporation
which
was
paid
under
protest.
and
of
course
there
is
a
tax
due
that
the
time
of
a
liquidation
of
the
assets
in
the
distribution
of
those
assets
to
the
stockholders.
this
is
of
course
a
point
that
has
already
been
complete.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
it’s
a
remedial
provision.
i
think
the
purpose
is
to
eliminate
this
kind
of
double
tax
in
the
situation
in
which
there’s
a
single
really
gain
or
loss
producing
transaction.
we’re
talking
about
the
gains.
you
have
the
same
gain
producing
track
transaction.
i
think
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
eliminate
a
tax
from
that
single
transaction
on
both
the
corporation
and
the
stockholders
when
distribution
is
made
in
liquidation
within
the
period
of
12
months.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
how
does
it
give
weight
or
force
to
that
purpose?
well,
because
under
the
facts
of
this
case
it
would
clearly
fall
within
that.
there
would
be
a
tax
on
the
corporation
and
a
tax
on
the
stockholder.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
the
casualty
happened,
yes.
but
i
distinguish
between
the
casualty
and
an
involuntary
conversion.
well,
i
think,
the
statutes
in
treasury
regulations
distinguish
between
a
casualty
loss
and
an
involuntary
conversion.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
because
i
can
do
no
more
than
repeat
my
attempt
to
an
answer
before
which
is
that
this
is
the
same
kind
of
transaction.
the
337
was
obviously
on
the
surface
designed
to
meet
what
is
the
difference
between
a
casualty
and
on
executory
contract
of
sale.
the
only
difference
is
its
thrust
upon
this
taxpayer,
he
has
no
choice
or
it
has
no
choice.
in
an
ordinary
sale
or
an
exchange,
the
taxpayer
can
take
his
own
time
in
maneuvering
negotiate,
and
then
still
has
the
remedial
of
fact
of
section
377,
that
on
an
equity
basis,
i
think
it’s
more
equitable
to
include
an
involuntary
conversion
by
casualties
or
this
ordinary
sale.
mr.
chief
justice
i
would
like
to
resume
on
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
briefly
--
counsel
professed
his
argument
with
a
reference
to
the
strict
time
sequence
required
by
the
statute,
and
he
also
this
argument
largely
in
the
same
vein.
and
with
that
in
mind,
i
would
like
to
read
treasury
of
regulation
14437-2a
which
says,
“in
ascertaining
whether
a
sale
or
exchange
occurs
on
or
after
the
date
in
which
the
plan
of
complete
liquidation
has
adopted
the
fact
that
negotiations
were
sale
may
have
been
commenced
either
by
the
corporation
or
insurer.”
all
of
those
are
both
shall
be
disregarded.
moreover,
in
executory
contract
to
sell
is
to
be
distinguished
from
the
contract
of
sale.
ordinarily,
a
sale
has
not
occurred
when
a
contract
to
sell
has
been
entered
into
but
title
and
possession
of
the
property
have
not
been
transferred.
and
this
is
the
strict
time
sequence
that
counsel
refers
to.
the
government
is
committed
to
the
proposition
because
it
acquiesce
by
revenue
ruling
in
it
that
an
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty
is
of
sale
or
exchange,
so
it
has
to
be
treated
that
way,
but
they
want
to
treat
it
differently.
they
want
to
treat
it
differently
from
a
sale.
they
want
to
treat
it
as
a
single
destructive
event
which
it
is
not.
the
whole
thrust,
the
whole
purpose
of
the
internal
revenue
code
of
income
taxes
is
directed
to
the
realization
of
gain
or
loss.
in
a
transaction
which
produces
gain
is
not
complete
until
this
is
some
enforceable
right
to
gain,
and
that
doesn’t
occur
here.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
we
still
have
that
in
the
event
that
this
decision
is
affirmed,
it
will
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
goes
through
that.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
i
know
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
right.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
it
is
saying
that
the
gain
was
realized
in
65
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
that’s
right.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
that
is
in
the
year
of
the
fire,
and
we
have
that
--
we
have
that
question
as
to
business
interruption
insurance.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
it
is
a
question
of
the
time
of
the
accrual,
is
it
not?
and
we
litigated
that
question
on
the
government
draft
that
i
think
in
all
fairness,
it
drafted
because
it
did
not
want
to
cloud
this
rather
narrow
issue,
but
there
has
been
a
tax
court
case
since
which
is
held
the
business
interruption
insurance
to
the
time
of
the
recovery
of
the
insurance
is
the
time
that
it
is
reported
that
i
doesn’t
relate
back.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
whereas
the
other
cases
that
indicated
what
year
that
a
gain
that
there
should
be
realized,
let
us
forget
the
liquidation.
well,
let
us
take
lucas
versus
north
texas
lumber
company.
you
know
that,
that
was
an
action
of
purchased
timberland
and
it
was
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
you
know
fire
case
and
casualty
loss.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
the
nearest
thing
that
i
have
but
i
cannot
say
it
to
you
or
i
think
it
is
the
nearest
thing,
justice
white
is
helvering
versus
hamel
which
is
cited
somewhere
either
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
our
brief,
and
that
was
a
foreclosure
sale.
and
they
said,
this
court
said
that
the
sale
was
not
reportable
at
the
time
of
decree
for
foreclosure.
but,
in
the
following
year
when
the
sale
actually
took
place,
that
was
the
decision
of
this
court
as
to
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer,
and
i
think
that
situation
is
similarly
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
no
question
about
that
in
my
mind
and
i
think
this
case
that
i
have
cited,
i
cannot
cite
you
a
higher
case
or
casualty
at
hand.
but
i
think
this
line
of
cases
lucas
versus
north
texas
lumber
company
which
is
also
cited
somewhere
in
the
briefs,
helvering
versus
hamel,
they
all
hold
to
this
effect.
that
is
at
the
time
that
an
obligation
arises
even
if
it
as
to
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer
that
the
gain
is
reported
and
not
at
the
time
of
the
incident
whether
it
be
a
casualty
or
the
exercise
of
an
option,
or
a
foreclosure
sale
on
the
petitioner’s
file.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
the
condemnation
occurs
of
course
at
the
time
of
the
taking,
there
is
no
question
about
that.
the
only
difference
is
on
the
cases
that
the
government
cites
are
under
we
talked
about
and
discussed
yesterday
are
in
those
statute.
those
peculiar
in
the
minority,
i
mean,
fewer
statutes,
i’m
sure.
let’s
say,
under
particular
statutes
that
at
the
time
the
declaration
is
filed,
the
government
has
the
right
to
possession
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
that
is
the
taking.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
but
under
a
majority
of
statutes,
that
does
not
happen
until
the
deposit
is
put
up
or
until
the
decree
is
put
up,
and
then
that
taking
occurs.
but
when
you
compare
an
involuntary
conversion
in
those
cases,
you
see,
it
is
not
the
casualty
itself;
it’s
the
creation
of
the
right
to
the
obligation
that
compares
to
the
taking
and
this
occurred
in
this
case
after
the
adoption
of
the
plan
of
liquidation.
thank
you.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i’m
sure
there
is
but
i
cannot
cite
you
by
name
and
report
number
of
the
case.
we
did
--
this
was
involved
in
the
district
court
and
we
prevailed
there,
and
it
was
not
taken
to
the
court
of
bills
by
the
government.
i
think
in
all
fairness
for
the
reason
that
i
just
said
to
you,
i
don’t
think
they
want
to
cloud
up
this
issue.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
decision
was
handed
down
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
and
before
we
could
file
our
petition,
the
government
filed
a
motion
in
the
district
court
to
consider
this
very
question.
so,
i
say
that
if
we
lose
here,
we’re
going
back
to
the
district
court
to
argue
that
question,
i
have
no
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
the
question
of
when
this
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
yes,
in
which
year,
and
i
don’t
have
any
doubts
as
to
how
it
is
going
to
come
out,
i
think
we’re
going
to
prevail,
but
nevertheless,
they
haven’t
given
up
on
this
question.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
well,
it’s
relevant
--
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
time
of
accrual,
the
time
of
accrual,
yes,
i
think
it
is
but
i
think
that
the
true
concur
in
this
case.
i
think
that
the
involuntary
conversion
by
casualty
concurs
with
the
accrual
of
the
right
to
receive
insurance
proceeds.
so,
it’s
important
to
that
extent,
yes.
mr.
larry
h.
snyder
i
think
that
the
court’s
body
had
but
there
is
--
if
i
say
again
or
repeat,
if
we
lose
here
then
we
do
have
--
the
government
has
not
abandoned
that
point.
and
of
course,
holding
that
these
proceeds
or
entitle
a
man
recognition,
the
court
--
the
district
court
was
not
presented
then
with
the
question
of
when
are
these
proceeds
report.
so,
it’s
a
--
as
i
say
it
hinges
upon
the
decision
of
this
court
as
to
whether
that’s
litigated.
thank
you.
