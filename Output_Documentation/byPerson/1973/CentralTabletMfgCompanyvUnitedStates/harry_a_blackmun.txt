justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
see
if
i
understand
that.
i
thought
that
liability
was
accepted
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
everything
about
on
which
their
liability
depended,
it
already
occurred?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
and
then
the
--
then
the
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
policy
--
the
policy
had
been
issued
and--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
understand.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
from
then
on,
it
was
--
if
there
were
arguments
that
was
arguments
over
the
facts
that
had
already
occurred,
or
the
meaning
of
instruments
already
issued?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
drawing
any
distinction
from
the
state
condemnation
on
a
federal
one?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
smith,
did
the
government
oppose
that
result
in
the
court
of
claims?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
we
have
the
adoption
of
the
plan
and
then
fire
within
the
12-month
period,
but
the
final
insurance
settlement
15-months
after
the
adoption
of
the
plan.
what
is
the
government’s
position
as
to
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
this
is
an
income
tax
case
coming
to
us
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
section
337
of
the
federal
internal
revenue
code,
provides
that
gain
or
loss
to
a
corporation
from
a
sale
or
exchange
of
property
taking
place
during
a
twelve
months
period,
following
the
corporation’s
adoption
of
a
plan
of
complete
liquidation,
is
not
to
be
recognized
or
in
other
words,
is
tax
free
to
the
corporation.
what
happened
here
is
that
a
fire
largely
destroyed
the
tax
payer
corporation’s
plant
in
ohio.
after
the
fire
the
corporation
adopted
a
plan
of
liquidation.
there
were
extensive
negotiations
with
the
insurance
companies
that
had
provided
the
fire
and
business
interruption
insurance
protection.
these
loss
claims
were
settled
after
the
adoption
of
the
plan
of
liquidation.
thus
chronologically
we
have
the
fire
and
then
the
adoption
of
the
plan
and
during
the
ensuing
year
payment
of
the
insurance
proceeds.
the
proceeds
exceeded
the
corporation’s
adjusted
income
tax
basis
and
the
destroyed
property.
as
a
consequence
there
was
gain,
and
the
issue
is
whether
that
gain
is
to
be
allocated
to
a
happening
of
a
fire
or
to
the
settlement
of
the
insurance
claims
during
the
year
of
following
the
adoption
of
the
plan.
if
the
former,
the
gain
is
taxable
to
corporation,
if
the
latter
the
gain
under
the
statute
is
not
recognized
or
taxed
to
the
corporation.
the
district
court
followed
a
decision
of
a
few
years
ago
by
the
eighth
circuit
and
entered
judgment
for
the
tax
payer.
the
court
of
appeals
refused
to
follow
the
eighth
circuit
opinion
and
reversed.
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
have
endeavored
to
trace
the
history
and
purpose
of
the
statute.
we
have
set
forth
our
reasons
for
reaching
our
conclusion.
i
am
authorized
to
state
that
mr.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
mr.
justice
douglas,
mr.
justice
brennan
and
mr.
justice
powell.
justice

well,
and
then
the

the

--
the
policy
had
been
issued
and--
justice
harry
a.

i
understand.

from
then
on,
it
was
