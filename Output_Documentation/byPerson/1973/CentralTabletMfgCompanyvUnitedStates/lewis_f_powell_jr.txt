does
the
owner
of
the
property
receive
notice
and
have
an
opportunity
to
be
ahead
before
his
property
is
taken?
justice
lewis
f.

i
think
we
do
better
than
that
in
virginia.
but
there
is
a
deposit,
isn’t
there?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
they
have
the
state’s
estimate
of
the
value?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

but
she
can
do
it
now?
justice

would
it
make
any
difference
to
your
submission
if
the
casualty
occurred
in
the
absence
of
insurance
and
yet
the
owner
of
the
building,
for
example
which
burned,
so
it
had
been
caused
by
the
negligence
of
someone
whom
he
intended
to
sue,
so
that
there
was
no
contractual
right
arguably
of
any
right
to
recover?
in
other
words,
suppose
the
only
claim
was
the
contingent
negligence
suit,
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
another
question,
let
us
assume
that
the
proceeds
to
this
prior
had
been
received
by
the
party
whose
property
was
burned
and
he
had
plan
to,
and
did
carry
on
the
plan
of
reconstructing
the
destroyed
building.
let’s
assume
the
proceeds
received
within
the
statutory
period
that
permits
them
to
be
received
for
reconstruction
purposes
were
their
recognition
of
gain.
justice
lewis
f.

1033,
right,
then
let’s
assume
that
the
day
after
the
building
that
reconstructed,
a
plan
of
liquidation
was
adopted,
would
there
be
any
problem
with
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
end
up
with
what
might
be
regarded
as
substantially
the
same
result,
don’t
you?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
that.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
the
government
just
really
wants
to
put
the
taxpayer
all
in
that
trouble,
does
it?
