unknown
speaker
mr.
snyder,
does
the
record
show
whether
the
fire
was
a
--
an
important
fact
in
the
decision
to
liquidate?
unknown
speaker
so
that
presumably,
if
the
fire
not
occurred,
central
tablet
would
still
be
functioning?
unknown
speaker
but
i
guess
the
government’s
position
is
even
if
the
liquidation
was
forced
by
the
fire,
that
the
event
was
still
before
the
plan
was
adopted.
unknown
speaker
and
that
the
--
unknown
speaker
that
the
tax
would
--
the
gain
would
not
be
recognized
if
there
was
a
voluntary
liquidation
but
it
would
be
recognized
if
there
was
a
compelled
one.
unknown
speaker
that
seems
to
be
their
position.
unknown
speaker
could
you
take
it
down
and
still
litigate
for
more?
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
what
difference
this
makes
this
case,
which
it
is
held
to
be.
unknown
speaker
that
and
what
--
the
--
unknown
speaker
well,
there
would
be
two
taxes.
unknown
speaker
one
on
the
corporation
and
one
on
the
--
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
rate
on
the
corporation?
unknown
speaker
it
would
not
be
--
would
not
be
the
regular
corporate
rate?
unknown
speaker
and,
the
rate
of
the
shareholders
would
vary.
unknown
speaker
well
--
unknown
speaker
what
was
--
what
was
the
refund
thing?
unknown
speaker
mr.
snyder,
what
do
you
regard
as
the
purpose
of
section
337?
unknown
speaker
how
does
your
position
here
give
weight
or
force
to
that
purpose?
unknown
speaker
well,
two
or
not
but
of
course
your
casualty,
it
happened
before
the
decision
to
liquidate
have
taken
place.
unknown
speaker
well,
wasn’t
it
the
purpose
of
the
statute
as
you
say
to
enable
corporations
in
this
kind
of
a
tax
situation,
as
your
corporation
was
with
a
low
base
to
liquidate
but
of
the
hazards
implied
by
the
court
case,
under
the
one
that
came
down
later
depending
on
a
slight
difference
in
factual
setup.
i
was
wondering,
when
this
casualty
is
thrown
upon
you,
and
as
you
indicated
yesterday
was
a
vital
factor
in
the
decisions
of
liquidate
rather
than
to
carry
on
whether
your
posture
here
for
on
accrual
basis
taxpayer
sponsoring
that
statutory
purpose
in
anyway.
unknown
speaker
what
taxes
are
at
issue
here?
for
what
year,
the
year
of
the
casualty
or
the
year
of
payment?
unknown
speaker
oh!
you
mean
the
government
--
do
you
think
when
a
casual
--
when
a
fire
takes
place
in
december
‘65,
and
the
proceeds
and
finally
paid
in
‘66,
and
there’s
a
gain,
the
gain
is
accruable
in
‘66.
unknown
speaker
but,
in
this
ordinary
case
where
there’s
no
liquidation
involved
and
there
is
a
loss
that
the
insurance
doesn’t
cover.
i
think
if
you
suggest
the
loss
of
the
approval
in
the
year
of
the
proceeds
would
be.
unknown
speaker
not
so
here.
unknown
speaker
that’s
all
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose,
in
my
brother
powell’s
hypothetical
case,
in
the
year
of
the
fire,
that
would
be
a
casualty
loss
to
the
corporation,
wouldn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
and
then
a
the
year
of
the
--
any
subsequent
year
of
recovery,
it
would
be
ordinary
--
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
--
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
a
casualty
loss
that’s
an
ordinary
loss.
it’s
not
going
to
be
under
a
capital
loss
--
unknown
speaker
right,
and
then
in
my
brother
powell’s
case
in
a
subsequent
year,
the
corporation
should
get
a
judgment
against
the
negligent
person
who
caused
the
fire,
but
will
the
tax
apply
beyond
that?
unknown
speaker
ordinary
income.
unknown
speaker
well,
his
question
was
what
if
the
corporation
was
under
a
12-month
plan
of
liquidation
at
the
time
of
the
recovery?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
so.
unknown
speaker
but
maybe
only
the
net
over
the
loss.
unknown
speaker
well
you
say,
i
take
it
--
you
say
i
take
it
that
if
there
have
never
been
a
liquidation
here,
then
the
proceeds
have
been
paid
exactly
as
they
were
paid
here,
that
the
company
by
good
accounting
practice
and
good
tax
accounting
practice
would
have
returned
the
gain
in
fiscal
66.
unknown
speaker
on
the
condemnation?
unknown
speaker
and,
that
is
the
taking
unknown
speaker
under
those
statutes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
snyder
but
there
must
be
some
law
in
this
fire
business,
the
casualty
business
of
the
loss
in
one
taxable
year
and
payment
the
next.
unknown
speaker
but
certainly,
i
take
it
as
of
here
are
now,
you
and
the
government
were
at
loggerheads
on
that
issue.
unknown
speaker
what
question?
unknown
speaker
whether
the
corporation
must
pay
to
50
to
65,
or
66.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
irrelevant
to
this
case,
is
it?
to
the
--
unknown
speaker
you
don’t
think
it’s
an
important
point
or
not
with
respect
to
the
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
snyder,
does
the
record
show
whether
the
fire
was
a

an

that
seems
to

their
position.
unknown

unknown

can
i
ask
you
what

this
makes
this
case,
which
it
is
held
to
be.
unknown
speaker
that
and
what
--
the
--
unknown
speaker
well,
there
would
be
two
taxes.
unknown
speaker
one
on
the
corporation
and
one
on
the
--
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
rate
on
the
corporation?
unknown

it
would
not

--
would
not
be
the

corporate
rate?
unknown
speaker
and,
the
rate
of
the

would

what

unknown

mr.

what
