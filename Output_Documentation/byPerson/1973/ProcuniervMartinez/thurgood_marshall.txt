justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
was
brought
under
a
federal
statute,
was
it
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
any
of
the
cases
you
cited
brought
under
that
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
don’t
want
keep
these
new
regulations
in
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
do
you
--
what’s
the
difference
between
the
two?
you
said,
you
understand
since
the
supreme
court
could
not
(inaudible)?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that
it
was
a
just
mistake
with
me
by
going
to
federal
court,
you
shouldn’t
be
going
to
state
court
but
california
agreed
they
were
wrong.
i
misunderstood
you,
i
guess.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
case
was
not
under
a
specific
statute
which
gave
a
federal
cause
of
action
which
this
permits.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
assume
you
will
oppose
the
supreme
court
of
california?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
as
vigorously
as
you
opposed
with
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
mr.
collins
your
answer
to
mr.
justice
douglas’
start
--
question
is
“yes?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
they
did
do
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
they
commit
the
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
he
could
still
write
letters?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn’t
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
couldn’t
stop
him,
could
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
could?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
a
man
is
arrested
and
you
can
stop
him
from
writing
letters?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
when
did
the
state
first
get
to
write
to
stop
him
from
writing
a
letter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
only
because
you
have
to.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
the
answer
is
yes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
to
the
next
question
is
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
because
he
gave
it
up
when
he
committed
the
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
gave
up
his
first
amendment
rights
when
he
committed
a
crime?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
also
gave
up
his
right
to
a
trial?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
why
do
you
pick
out
just
one
right
he
loses?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
give
up
his
right
to
vote?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
only
gave
up
his
right
to
write
a
letter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
when
a
man
talks
to
his
lawyer,
it’s
monitored?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
everything
else
is
monitored?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don’t
you
say
it
was
monitored.
now,
you
said
occasionally?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
does
the
person
know
when
he
is
being
monitored?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
was
brought
under
a

statute,

it
