chief

e.

you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what’s
the
subject
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
suppose
he
gave
up
his
right
to
first
amendment
right
to
free
assembly
at
the
time
of
his
conviction
not
at
the
very
time
he
committed
the
crime?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
the
time
of
his
conviction,
he
could
no
longer
freely
attend
any
meetings
he
wanted
to.
i
suspect
there
wouldn’t
be
any
question
about
that
because
he
is
put
in
a
cell
every
night.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
addressing
yourself
to
the
fact
that
it
isn’t
an
identifiable
or
otherwise
regulated
group?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
turner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
backup
a
little
on
the
abstention
issue
if
i
may
with
you.
are
you
saying
that
to
the
absent
to
any
california
statute
defining
the
authority
of
the
prison
director
or
guidelines
that
state
court
could
be
presented
with
this
question
would
have
to
do
exactly
what
a
federal
court
does?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
the
federal
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or,
what
about
the
california
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
you're
not
making
any
claim
that
prisoners
have
full
first
amendment
rights?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
don’t
have
the
right
of
assembly
in
the
sense
that
a
person
--
a
free
person
has,
do
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
can’t
call
a
meeting
and
make
the
director
open
up
all
the
cells
and
gather
out
in
the
yard
for
a
meeting.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
are
you
just
picking
out
as
one
very
important
right
of
--
first
amendment
right
which
the
people
on
the
outside
have
and
you
concede
when
they
go
in,
they
don’t
have
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
the
question
of
what
other
first
amendment
rights
they’ve
lost
is
what’s
at
issue
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
do
deal
them
if
the
right
of
association
with
family
and
friends?
do
you
flush
that
up
a
little?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
i
know
but
how
far
do
you
claim
they
are
entitled
to
that
right
of
association?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
prisoners
have
visitors
at
the
prison?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
--
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean
now
when
you
are
saying
of
the
right
of
free
association
to
what
extent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
wouldn’t
have
thought
of
that
as
association
when
you're
also
talking
about
free
expression
by
letters?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
are
we
at
now?
what
page
of
the
supplement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
with
the
one
i
have
--
that’s
the
beginning
of
c,
1201.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
it
could
only
be
the
last
sentence
of
trouble
when
the
prison
involved
there,
is
that
not
so?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
the
part
that’s
now
superseded?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
let
us
find
each
one
as
you
are
going
along.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
got
the
roman
page
vi
at
the
end
of
the
appellant’s

chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
where
do
we
find
the
new
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
b?
is
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
district
court’s
further
was
reference
to
these
paraprofessionals
is
not
self-executing,
is
it?
you
indicated
that
its
paraprofessional
other
than
the
law
students
certified
paraprofessionals
certified
by
the
state
bar
and
you
say
they
haven’t
certified
any
yet?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
if
they
don’t
certify
any
of
them
that
remain
some
rhetoric?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unless
they
mandamus
the
state
bar?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
must
be
more
than
just
getting
the
paper
signed
because
that
could
be
done
by
the
mail,
couldn’t
it?
the
way
private
finds.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
must
be
some
interview
process
involved
in
which
the
paraprofessional
that
you're
talking
about
is
going
to
engaged
in
some
substantive
discussion
with
the
prisoners,
isn’t
that
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.

the

chief

very
well.
