justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
from
the
northern
district
of
california.
the
appellees,
california
prison
inmates,
brought
a
class
action
suit
challenging
regulations
with
respect
to
the
censorship
of
inmate
correspondence.
the
regulation
prohibited
correspondence
that
magnified
grievances,
unduly
complained
or
that
expressed
inflammatory
views,
or
that
otherwise
contained
inappropriate
information.
the
censorship
of
personal
correspondence
involves
incidental
restrictions
on
the
right
to
free
speech
of
prison
inmates
and
also
of
those
who
correspond
with
them.
censorship
is
justified
only
if
the
following
criteria
are
met.
it
must
first
further
one
or
more
of
the
substantial
governmental
interests,
implicated
in
prison
administration.
these
are
maintenance
of
security
and
order
and
the
rehabilitation
of
inmates.
also,
the
restrictions
on
correspondence
must
be
no
greater
than
is
necessary
to
further
the
legitimate
governmental
interest
involved.
we
hold
that
the
california
regulations
in
question
do
not
need
that
foregoing
criteria
and
therefore,
they
unduly
burden
the
right
of
free
speech.
the
case
presented
several
other
questions
with
respect
to
prison
regulations
which
we
have
addressed
in
our
opinion
filed
today
with
a
click.
we
think
that
the
district
court’s
disposition
of
all
issues
was
correct
and
accordingly
its
judgment
is
affirmed.

justice
