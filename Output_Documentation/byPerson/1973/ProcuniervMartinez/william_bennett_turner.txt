mr.
william
bennett
turner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
has
argued
that
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
in
this
case
on
one
issue
only
that
of
mail
censorship
rules
but
there
is
no
basis
on
which
that
issue
could
be
decided
on
state
law
grounds.
there
is
no
uncertainty
whatever
about
the
whether
these
rules
apply
to
prisoners
in
california,
they
do.
there
is
no
uncertainty
about
whether
they
apply
to
all
letters
from
prisoners
to
their
family
or
friends,
they
do.
and
there
is
no
uncertainty
that
these
rules
are
designed
to
give
the
censoring
guards
absolute
open-ended
unchecked
censorship
power
as
to
their
contents.
these
rules
were
authoritatively
construed
by
director
procunier
in
his
testimony
and
deposition
in
this
case
to
permit
the
censoring
guard
to
fill
in
the
blank
to
find
a
reason
that
he
would
think
would
be
appropriate
for
rejecting
any
particular
letter.
director
procunier
testified
that
that
was
permissible
under
the
rules
involved
in
this
case.
now
under
california
law,
under
section
5058
of
the
california
penal
code,
the
director
has
complete
unreviewable
authority
to
make
and
change
rules
and
regulations
for
the
administration
of
the
prison.
there
is
no
restriction
on
that,
no
state
statute
limits
his
discretion
in
any
way.
therefore,
there
is
no
state
law
basis
for
deciding
the
issue
of
mail
censorship.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
there
is
no
contention
in
this
case
your
honor
that
the
prison
officials
may
not
read
every
piece
of
mail
going
in
and
out
of
the
prison
involving
family
and
friends
of
prisoners.
even
though,
that
practice
has
been
abandoned
by
a
large
number
of
prison
systems
around
the
country
and
recommended
by
the
national
advisory
commission
on
criminal
justice
standards
and
goals.
there’s
no
contention
here
that
they
might
not
read
the
mail.
the
contention
here
is
limited
to
censoring
the
contents
of
the
mail,
rejecting
letters,
and
punishing
prisoners
for
what
they
say
in
their
letters.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
you,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
we
are
supporting
the
order
of
the
district
court
which
permits
the
reading
of
all
social
mail
and
rules
that
were
approved
finally
by
the
district
court
on
august
the
1st
of
this
year
permit
the
censoring
of
specific
contents
that
are
deemed
to
present
some
danger
to
prison
security
or
some
other
penal
interest.
and
we
are
here
to
support
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
for
purpose
of
this
case,
yes
your
honor.
the
appellants
have
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
an
issue
regarding
section
2600
subsection
4
of
the
penal
code
and
they
suggest
that
that
statute
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
resolution
of
this
case.
but
the
statute
cannot
be
fairly
interpreted
to
govern
the
issues
presented
here.
nobody
has
ever
before
suggested
that
it
had
anything
to
do
with
mail
censorship.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
right.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
right.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
it
could
apply
the
california
constitution
but
the
california
court
say
that
under
the
california
equivalent
of
the
first
amendment,
the
federal
are
precedence
on
constitutionality
would
govern.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no,
there's
no
contention
of
that
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
certainly
not.
there's
no
right
of
assembly
involved
in
this
case
at
all.
it’s
only
the
right
of
expression.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
there
are
really
three
kinds
of
first
amendment
rights
involved
here.
one
is
the
right
of
free
expression;
another
is
the
right
of
association
with
family
and
friends
on
the
outside;
and
finally,
there's
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
this
is
the
only
link
the
many
prisoners
have
to
the
outside
world
at
all.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
only
to
the
extent
that
they
are
allowed
to
maintain
communicating
links
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
that’s
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
only
to
the
extent
of
correspondents
with
the
family
and
friends
in
the
community.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
i
think
expression
is
the
basic
part
of
the
first
amendment.
but
there
is
also
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances.
i
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
the
letters
that
were
rejected
by
the
prison
administrator
for
some
prisoners
there.
they
are
exhibits
to
the
deposition
of
few
amorphous
and
in
those
letters,
the
prisoners
were
saying
to
their
father
or
mother,
“please
get
me
a
lawyer
to
deal
with
this
problem
that
i
have.”
and
that’s
the
only
way
that
they
can
get
to
a
lawyer
is
to
write
to
their
family
to
go
out
and
hire
them
a
lawyer.
so,
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances
is
also
involved
even
in
the
social
mail
context.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
it’s
not
involved
at
all
in
this
case.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
oh,
that’s
a
separate
issue.
that
would
be
solely
for
the
purpose
of
serving
as
an
investigator
for
the
lawyer.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes,
indeed.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no
doubt
about
it.
the
--
getting
back
to
section
2600
subsection
4,
in
order
to
have
anything
to
do
with
mail
censorship,
this
statute
would
have
to
be
turned
on
to
its
head.
i
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
the
statute
which
is
reproduced
as
exhibit
b
to
the
brief
for
appellants.
the
structure
of
the
statute
is
as
follows.
if
a
person
is
sentence
to
imprisonment
in
california,
all
of
his
civil
rights
are
thereby
suspended
and
he
has
none.
that’s
what
the
statute
provides.
and
then
in
the
third
paragraph
the
statute
states
that
this
section
shall
not
be
construed
so
as
to
deprive
such
person
of
the
following
civil
rights
and
then
four
specific
civil
rights
are
listed.
and
the
fourth
one,
is
the
right
to
purchase,
receive,
and
read
any
and
in
all
newspapers,
periodicals,
and
books
accepted
by
the
post
office.
then,
there's
a
qualification
on
that
right
giving
prison
authorities
the
power
to
exclude
obscene
publications
or
writings
and
this
is
the
first
mention
of
mail.
and
mail
containing
information
concerning
where,
how,
or
from
whom
such
matter
referring
to
obscene
publications
and
writings
may
be
obtained.
now,
the
statute,
thus,
takes
away
all
civil
rights
except
for
specific
ones
and
this
mention
of
mail
is
only
a
qualification
an
exception
to
an
exception
if
you
will.
and
it
just
doesn’t
confer
a
general
right
in
the
prisoner
not
to
have
his
mail
censored.
even
if
the
statute
were
applicable,
even
if
the
structure
of
the
statute
were
not
as
it
is,
the
statute
deals
only
with
incoming
matter
and
not
at
all
with
outgoing
matter.
it
gives
the
prison
officials
the
right
to
exclude
certain
things
from
the
prison.
but
it
doesn’t
deal
with
things
that
are
going
out
and
the
issues
in
this
case
involve
what
the
prisoners
are
writing
outside
of
the
prison.
basically,
it
is
the
unduly
complaining,
the
magnifying
grievances
kind
of
things.
those
applied
to
the
prisoners,
letters
going
out
and
not
going
in.
therefore,
even
if
the
statute
could
be
interpreted
the
way
the
deputy
attorney
general
would
have
it
read,
it
could
only
apply
to
a
very
small
part
of
this
case
and
would
not
significantly
alter
the
constitutional
issue.
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
the
harold
decision
mention
by
counsel
for
appellant,
did
interpret
this
subsection
of
the
statute,
that
court
reads
the
statute
the
same
way
we
do.
in
short,
the
issue
of
mail
censorship
could
only
be
decided
on
federal
constitutional
grounds
and
there’s
no
basis
for
sending
the
prisoners
into
the
state
court
system.
turning
to
the
substantive
issue
on
mail
censorship,
it’s
essential
to
focus
on
exactly
what
the
district
court
did
and
what
it
didn’t
do.
the
regulations
that
the
court
invalidated
have
to
be
compared
with
the
regulations
that
they
finally
approve
on
august
the
1st
of
this
year
under
which
the
state
has
been
operating
for
several
months.
the
new
rules
which
were
approved
by
the
district
court
are
printed
in
the
supplement
to
the
appendix
at
pages
195
and
196.
and
these
rules
give
the
prison
officials
very,
very
broad
authority
to
censor
mail
incoming
and
outgoing
for
a
whole
variety
of
reasons.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
the
supplement
to
the
appendix
pages
195
and
196,
your
honor.
if
there
is
something
that
the
state
need
in
administering
prisoners
and
prisoner
mail
that
isn’t
in
these
rules,
the
state
hasn’t
said
what
it
is.
it
didn’t
tell
the
district
court
what
it
is.
it
hasn’t
told
this
court
what
it
is.
the
--
when
you
compare
the
rules
given
final
approval
by
the
district
court
with
the
ones
that
they
invalidated.
they
find
it
did
not
affect
of
what
the
court
below
did
was
to
invalidate
the
following.
prohibiting
prisoners
from
writing
letters
in
which
they
“unduly
complain”
in
which
they
magnify
grievances,
and
which
they
express
inflammatory,
political,
or
other
views
or
beliefs
which
are
defamatory
but
that
does
not
mean
libelous
according
to
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
mailroom
officers
that
man
--
that
prisoner
belittling
the
staff
or
criticizing
policy.
and
finally,
they
catch
all
letters
that
are
“otherwise
inappropriate.”
this
is
the
one
that
gives
then
censoring
guards
the
right
to
fill
in
the
blank
on
the
checklist
with
whatever
reason
he
deems
appropriate.
and
of
course,
the
entire
letter
is
rejected
if
any
part
is
objectionable.
the
rest
of
the
rules
that
were
involved
beginning
of
this
case
survived
intact
in
substance,
and
the
rules
approved
finally
by
the
district
court
and
the
state
has
not
complained
that
any
of
this
new
rules
lead
any
of
their
interest
unprotected.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
parts
of
that
did.
the
obscenity
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no,
they
would
have
to
be
compared
and
it’s
not
word
for
word.
it
is
in
substance
all
of
for
example
obscenity
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
what
went
out
were
the
provisions
referring
to
exhibit
c
to
the
brief
of
appellants
in
rule
1201,
the
unduly
complaining
and
magnifying
grievances
provisions
came
out.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
and
then
in
1205
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
or
behave
anywhere
which
might
lead
to
violence.
that
--
the
rules
were
enjoined
of
course
only
insofar
as
they
applied
to
mail.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
if
you
look
at
the
rule
finally
approved
it
would
ban
letters
containing
plans
for
activities
in
violation
of
institutional
rules
and
it’s
in
violation
of
institution
rules
to
agitate.
so,
i
think
that
would
still
survive.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
1205
under
the
contraband
rule
insofar
as
it
applies
to
mail
at
all.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
writings,
expressing
inflammatory,
political,
racial,
religious
other
views
or
beliefs
when
not
in
the
immediate
possession
of
the
originator.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
that
went
out
insofar
as
it
applies
to
mail.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
then,
in
2402
(8),
on
the
next
page.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i
think
the
substance
of
(f)
has
survived.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
and
the
first
paragraph
on
the
next
page.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
but
in
2402
(8)
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
defamatory
went
out
as
well
as
or
are
otherwise
inappropriate.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
it.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i
don’t
think
that’s
meant
to
be
words
your
honor.
i
think
that
substances
maybe
--
they
maybe
getting
it
drugs
or
something
of
that
matter.
these
rules
unduly
complaining
and
magnifying
grievances
and
so
on
are
relics
of
the
non-distinguished
past
in
prison
administration
and
they
are
not
needed
to
run
any
prison.
as
the
states
that
have
done
a
way
with
reading
mail
all
together
shall
and
as
the
new
report
of
the
national
advisory
commission
on
criminal
justice
standards
and
goals
shows,
indeed
the
state
has
never
said
in
this
case
that
it
has
any
interest
at
all
in
enforcing
these
particular
rules.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
correct
your
honor.
but
it
does
apply
to
letters.
we
specifically
asked
in
a
request
for
admissions,
does
this
apply
to
letters
and
the
answer
was
yes.
that’s
in
the
record.
and
certainly
the
testimony
of
the
censoring
guard
was
that
they
frequently
used
the
unduly
complaining
and
magnifying
grievances
provisions
to
censor
criticism
of
them
or
their
policies.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
correct.
that
would
be
only
the
sentence
that
the
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
correct.
what
we’re
dealing
here
--
dealing
with
here
is
just
expression,
it
is
not
obscenity,
not
libel,
not
fighting
words,
we’re
not
talking
about
conduct.
we’re
not
talking
demonstrations
or
circulating
anything
within
the
prison.
moreover,
this
is
expression
contained
in
letters
that
are
address
to
correspondents’
people
who
are
approved
by
the
department
of
corrections.
we
believe
that
the
district
court’s
conclusion
on
the
mail
censorship
rules
was
clearly
correct
and
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
not
in
this
case.
turning
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
copying
of
mail?
yes,
we
did.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no,
i'm
afraid
it
wasn’t
referring
to
page
198
of
the
supplement
to
the
appendix
under
the
rules
finally
approved
by
the
district
court.
the
officials
still
have
the
right
to
place
in
a
prisoner’s
file.
not
only
matters
that
are
in
violation
of
the
rules
but
also
anything
they
think
is
“relevant
to
assessment
of
the
inmate’s
rehabilitation”
or
just
essentially
could
mean
anything.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
we
vigorously
argued
in
the
district
court
that
they
didn’t
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes,
they
may.
turning
to
the
problem
of
investigators
working
for
lawyers,
once
again
it
is
essential
to
focus
on
exactly
what
the
district
court
did
and
what
it
didn’t
do.
compare
the
former
rule
that
was
invalidated
with
the
rules
that
were
finally
approved.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
alright.
the
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
the
old
rule.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
the
new
rule
is
at
page
--
it
begins
on
198
of
the
supplement
to
the
appendix.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes,
b,
investigators.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
now,
the
former
rule
was
an
absolute
prohibition
against
attorneys
using
either
law
students
or
paraprofessionals
for
the
purpose
of
interviewing
prisoners
whom
they
were
representing
or
considering
whether
to
represent.
this
was
to
true
regardless
of
who
the
prisoner
was,
regardless
of
who
the
lawyer
was,
regardless
of
who
the
investigator
was,
regardless
of
the
kind
of
case,
or
the
need
to
use
an
investigator
regardless
of
any
other
possibly
relevant
factor.
now,
after
the
initial
decision
of
the
district
court,
the
department
of
corrections
voluntarily
opened
the
class
of
investigators
to
permit
law
students
who’ve
been
certified
by
the
state
bar
of
california
to
serve
as
investigators.
the
only
addition
to
that
made
by
the
district
court
in
its
final
order
is
to
authorize
the
use
of
paraprofessional
persons,
who
have
been
certified
as
well
by
the
state
bar
of
california.
as
of
this
time,
there
is
no
procedure
and
no
certification
by
the
state
bar
for
paraprofessionals.
so,
the
district
court
has
not
ordered
the
department
to
do
anything
that
isn’t
doing
voluntarily
already.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
right.
they
were
ordered
to
submit
regulations
that
would
permit
the
use
of
paraprofessionals
but
they
began
voluntarily
allowing
law
students
in
before
they
were
ever
ordered
to
do
so,
months
before
they
were
ever
ordered
to
do
so.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
after
the
opinion
and
while
new
regulations
were
being
worked
out.
the
former
rule
that
barred
all
use
of
paraprofessional
assistance
to
lawyers
was
in
fact
a
serious
obstacle
to
obtaining
representation
for
indigent
prisoners.
these
prisoners
can’t
afford
either
a
lawyer
or
the
services
of
the
state
license
private
detective.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
right.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
right,
an
empty
promise.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
the
state
bar
of
california
has
recommended
legislation
just
last
summer
because
they
think
it’s
important
to
start
paraprofessional
use
in
all
aspects
in
the
practice
of
law
to
enhance
the
quality
of
legal
services
and
expand
the
number
of
people
that
services
can
be
rendered
to.
they
want
to
do
that
through
paraprofessional.
so,
i
think
they
will
get
to
it.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes.
i'm
not
sure
what
is
meant
by
that.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
local
bar
associations.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
the
right
of
access
to
the
courts
--
effective
access
to
the
courts.
it’s
the
same
right
that
was
involved
in
johnson.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
the
state
does
have
an
interest
but
that
interest
is
certainly
adequately
protected
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
as
in
johnson
against
avery
was
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
what
it
did
was
exclude
a
lot
of
people
who
could
be
very,
very
helpful.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
and
provided
they
--
they
certainly
do.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
i
wouldn’t
put
it
that
way.
it
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
certainly
not.
but
we
are
not
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
we
are
talking
about
two
different
things
right
here.
but
the
prisoners
have
a
right
of
access
to
the
courts
through
whatever
means
don’t
involved
any
problems
of
prison
security.
the
state
bar
of
california
can
certainly
promulgate
the
standards
for
professional
conduct
and
the
state
bar
has
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
the
question
is
what
are
satisfactory
qualifications
and
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
in
this
case,
the
court
below
held
that
the
state
didn’t
have
any
interest
really
in
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
that’s
because
the
prison
authorities
didn’t
attempt
to
justify
the
exclusion
of
the
people
that
the
district
court
ordered
should
be
let
in.
and
the
reason
for
the
district
court’s
order
is
because
this
rule
made
the
difference
in
very
many
cases
whether
a
lawyer
--
whether
a
prisoner
would
have
legal
representation
or
not.
in
this
very
case,
my
co-counsel
was
requested
by
federal
district
judge
to
look
into
this
case
which
had
been
filed
pro
se
by
the
prisoner
investigated
and
considered
taking
on
uncompensated
appointment.
when
she
tried
to
send
a
third
year
law
student
working
closely
under
a
supervision
to
see
the
prisoner
and
get
the
facts,
he
was
barred
by
this
very
rule
and
he
was
transferred
and
it
didn’t
happen
again.
that’s
how
this
issue
got
in
this
case
and
took
a
good
while
to
get
this
case
prepared
because
of
that
rule.
but
as
the
record
show
is
in
many
other
cases,
the
lawyers
had
been
discouraged
from
getting
involved
at
all
with
the
representation
of
prisoners
because
of
the
remoteness
of
prisons.
they
have
to
take
days
off
from
your
office
just
to
go
get
paper
signed.
they
can’t
even
send
a
messenger
to
get
paper
signed
under
this
rule.
they
have
to
go
in
person.
and
that
was
a
handicap
in
representing
california
prisoners.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
it
could
be
done
by
mail
if
the
documents
did
not
have
to
be
explained
or
show
the
prisoner
what's
in
and
so
on.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes.
it
is
the
personal
interview
thing
that
is
the
most
important
but
to
show
how
far
the
rule
goes
it
bars
even
going
out
to
the
prison
there
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
under
the
old
rule.
we
submit
that
this
aspect
of
the
case
is
controlled
by
the
court’s
decision
in
johnson
v.
avery
where
the
court
struck
down
the
jailhouse
lawyer
rule
that
prohibited
prisoners
from
helping
each
other
on
legal
work.
certainly,
if
the
state’s
interest
there,
if
there’s
a
burden
on
the
state
to
justify
banning
jailhouse
lawyers
which
was
not
met
in
johnson
versus
avery,
it
ought
to
be
heavier
burden
of
justification
or
you’re
talking
about
people
who
are
closely
supervised
and
certified
by
attorneys.
there's
no
contention
--
then
no
contention
in
this
case
that
any
harm
would
ever,
would
flow
from
the
use
state
bar
certified
law
students
and
paraprofessionals
and
for
all
these
reasons
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i
know
what
you're
referring
to.
i
suppose
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
any
of
those
events.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
i
think
it
is
a
real
problem
but
the
attorney
general
has
made
a
lot
of
the
fact
that
these
interviews
will
be
confidential.
that’s
a
red
herring
because
all
interviews,
all
visits,
social,
and
other
in
california
are
confidential
but
not
monitored
at
all
--
they’re
visually
monitored.
a
guard
looks
at
you
while
you
talk
to
the
prisoner
but
nobody
is
listening.
that’s
even
true
with
social
visits.
and
it
would
be
true
with
the
paraprofessionals
as
well.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
has
argued
that
the
district
court
should
have
abstained
in
this
case
on
one
issue
only
that
of
mail
censorship
rules
but
there
is
no
basis
on
which
that
issue
could
be
decided
on
state
law
grounds.
there
is
no
uncertainty
whatever
about
the
whether
these
rules
apply
to
prisoners
in
california,
they
do.
there
is
no
uncertainty
about
whether
they
apply
to
all
letters
from
prisoners
to
their
family
or
friends,
they
do.
and
there
is
no
uncertainty
that
these
rules
are
designed
to
give
the
censoring
guards
absolute
open-ended
unchecked
censorship
power
as
to
their
contents.
these
rules
were
authoritatively
construed
by
director
procunier
in
his
testimony
and
deposition
in
this
case
to
permit
the
censoring
guard
to
fill
in
the
blank
to
find
a
reason
that
he
would
think
would
be
appropriate
for
rejecting
any
particular
letter.
director
procunier
testified
that
that
was
permissible
under
the
rules
involved
in
this
case.
now
under
california
law,
under
section
5058
of
the
california
penal
code,
the
director
has
complete
unreviewable
authority
to
make
and
change
rules
and
regulations
for
the
administration
of
the
prison.
there
is
no
restriction
on
that,
no
state
statute
limits
his
discretion
in
any
way.
therefore,
there
is
no
state
law
basis
for
deciding
the
issue
of
mail
censorship.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
there
is
no
contention
in
this
case
your
honor
that
the
prison
officials
may
not
read
every
piece
of
mail
going
in
and
out
of
the
prison
involving
family
and
friends
of
prisoners.
even
though,
that
practice
has
been
abandoned
by
a
large
number
of
prison
systems
around
the
country
and
recommended
by
the
national
advisory
commission
on
criminal
justice
standards
and
goals.
there’s
no
contention
here
that
they
might
not
read
the
mail.
the
contention
here
is
limited
to
censoring
the
contents
of
the
mail,
rejecting
letters,
and
punishing
prisoners
for
what
they
say
in
their
letters.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
you,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
we
are
supporting
the
order
of
the
district
court
which
permits
the
reading
of
all
social
mail
and
rules
that
were
approved
finally
by
the
district
court
on
august
the
1st
of
this
year
permit
the
censoring
of
specific
contents
that
are
deemed
to
present
some
danger
to
prison
security
or
some
other
penal
interest.
and
we
are
here
to
support
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
for
purpose
of
this
case,
yes
your
honor.
the
appellants
have
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
court
an
issue
regarding
section
2600
subsection
4
of
the
penal
code
and
they
suggest
that
that
statute
might
have
something
to
do
with
the
resolution
of
this
case.
but
the
statute
cannot
be
fairly
interpreted
to
govern
the
issues
presented
here.
nobody
has
ever
before
suggested
that
it
had
anything
to
do
with
mail
censorship.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
right.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
right.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
it
could
apply
the
california
constitution
but
the
california
court
say
that
under
the
california
equivalent
of
the
first
amendment,
the
federal
are
precedence
on
constitutionality
would
govern.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no,
there's
no
contention
of
that
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
certainly
not.
there's
no
right
of
assembly
involved
in
this
case
at
all.
it’s
only
the
right
of
expression.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
there
are
really
three
kinds
of
first
amendment
rights
involved
here.
one
is
the
right
of
free
expression;
another
is
the
right
of
association
with
family
and
friends
on
the
outside;
and
finally,
there's
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
this
is
the
only
link
the
many
prisoners
have
to
the
outside
world
at
all.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
only
to
the
extent
that
they
are
allowed
to
maintain
communicating
links
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
that’s
not
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
only
to
the
extent
of
correspondents
with
the
family
and
friends
in
the
community.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
i
think
expression
is
the
basic
part
of
the
first
amendment.
but
there
is
also
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances.
i
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
the
letters
that
were
rejected
by
the
prison
administrator
for
some
prisoners
there.
they
are
exhibits
to
the
deposition
of
few
amorphous
and
in
those
letters,
the
prisoners
were
saying
to
their
father
or
mother,
“please
get
me
a
lawyer
to
deal
with
this
problem
that
i
have.”
and
that’s
the
only
way
that
they
can
get
to
a
lawyer
is
to
write
to
their
family
to
go
out
and
hire
them
a
lawyer.
so,
the
right
to
petition
for
redress
of
grievances
is
also
involved
even
in
the
social
mail
context.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
it’s
not
involved
at
all
in
this
case.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
oh,
that’s
a
separate
issue.
that
would
be
solely
for
the
purpose
of
serving
as
an
investigator
for
the
lawyer.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes,
indeed.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no
doubt
about
it.
the
--
getting
back
to
section
2600
subsection
4,
in
order
to
have
anything
to
do
with
mail
censorship,
this
statute
would
have
to
be
turned
on
to
its
head.
i
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
the
statute
which
is
reproduced
as
exhibit
b
to
the
brief
for
appellants.
the
structure
of
the
statute
is
as
follows.
if
a
person
is
sentence
to
imprisonment
in
california,
all
of
his
civil
rights
are
thereby
suspended
and
he
has
none.
that’s
what
the
statute
provides.
and
then
in
the
third
paragraph
the
statute
states
that
this
section
shall
not
be
construed
so
as
to
deprive
such
person
of
the
following
civil
rights
and
then
four
specific
civil
rights
are
listed.
and
the
fourth
one,
is
the
right
to
purchase,
receive,
and
read
any
and
in
all
newspapers,
periodicals,
and
books
accepted
by
the
post
office.
then,
there's
a
qualification
on
that
right
giving
prison
authorities
the
power
to
exclude
obscene
publications
or
writings
and
this
is
the
first
mention
of
mail.
and
mail
containing
information
concerning
where,
how,
or
from
whom
such
matter
referring
to
obscene
publications
and
writings
may
be
obtained.
now,
the
statute,
thus,
takes
away
all
civil
rights
except
for
specific
ones
and
this
mention
of
mail
is
only
a
qualification
an
exception
to
an
exception
if
you
will.
and
it
just
doesn’t
confer
a
general
right
in
the
prisoner
not
to
have
his
mail
censored.
even
if
the
statute
were
applicable,
even
if
the
structure
of
the
statute
were
not
as
it
is,
the
statute
deals
only
with
incoming
matter
and
not
at
all
with
outgoing
matter.
it
gives
the
prison
officials
the
right
to
exclude
certain
things
from
the
prison.
but
it
doesn’t
deal
with
things
that
are
going
out
and
the
issues
in
this
case
involve
what
the
prisoners
are
writing
outside
of
the
prison.
basically,
it
is
the
unduly
complaining,
the
magnifying
grievances
kind
of
things.
those
applied
to
the
prisoners,
letters
going
out
and
not
going
in.
therefore,
even
if
the
statute
could
be
interpreted
the
way
the
deputy
attorney
general
would
have
it
read,
it
could
only
apply
to
a
very
small
part
of
this
case
and
would
not
significantly
alter
the
constitutional
issue.
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
the
harold
decision
mention
by
counsel
for
appellant,
did
interpret
this
subsection
of
the
statute,
that
court
reads
the
statute
the
same
way
we
do.
in
short,
the
issue
of
mail
censorship
could
only
be
decided
on
federal
constitutional
grounds
and
there’s
no
basis
for
sending
the
prisoners
into
the
state
court
system.
turning
to
the
substantive
issue
on
mail
censorship,
it’s
essential
to
focus
on
exactly
what
the
district
court
did
and
what
it
didn’t
do.
the
regulations
that
the
court
invalidated
have
to
be
compared
with
the
regulations
that
they
finally
approve
on
august
the
1st
of
this
year
under
which
the
state
has
been
operating
for
several
months.
the
new
rules
which
were
approved
by
the
district
court
are
printed
in
the
supplement
to
the
appendix
at
pages
195
and
196.
and
these
rules
give
the
prison
officials
very,
very
broad
authority
to
censor
mail
incoming
and
outgoing
for
a
whole
variety
of
reasons.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
the
supplement
to
the
appendix
pages
195
and
196,
your
honor.
if
there
is
something
that
the
state
need
in
administering
prisoners
and
prisoner
mail
that
isn’t
in
these
rules,
the
state
hasn’t
said
what
it
is.
it
didn’t
tell
the
district
court
what
it
is.
it
hasn’t
told
this
court
what
it
is.
the
--
when
you
compare
the
rules
given
final
approval
by
the
district
court
with
the
ones
that
they
invalidated.
they
find
it
did
not
affect
of
what
the
court
below
did
was
to
invalidate
the
following.
prohibiting
prisoners
from
writing
letters
in
which
they
“unduly
complain”
in
which
they
magnify
grievances,
and
which
they
express
inflammatory,
political,
or
other
views
or
beliefs
which
are
defamatory
but
that
does
not
mean
libelous
according
to
the
testimony
of
one
of
the
mailroom
officers
that
man
--
that
prisoner
belittling
the
staff
or
criticizing
policy.
and
finally,
they
catch
all
letters
that
are
“otherwise
inappropriate.”
this
is
the
one
that
gives
then
censoring
guards
the
right
to
fill
in
the
blank
on
the
checklist
with
whatever
reason
he
deems
appropriate.
and
of
course,
the
entire
letter
is
rejected
if
any
part
is
objectionable.
the
rest
of
the
rules
that
were
involved
beginning
of
this
case
survived
intact
in
substance,
and
the
rules
approved
finally
by
the
district
court
and
the
state
has
not
complained
that
any
of
this
new
rules
lead
any
of
their
interest
unprotected.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
parts
of
that
did.
the
obscenity
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no,
they
would
have
to
be
compared
and
it’s
not
word
for
word.
it
is
in
substance
all
of
for
example
obscenity
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
what
went
out
were
the
provisions
referring
to
exhibit
c
to
the
brief
of
appellants
in
rule
1201,
the
unduly
complaining
and
magnifying
grievances
provisions
came
out.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
and
then
in
1205
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
or
behave
anywhere
which
might
lead
to
violence.
that
--
the
rules
were
enjoined
of
course
only
insofar
as
they
applied
to
mail.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
if
you
look
at
the
rule
finally
approved
it
would
ban
letters
containing
plans
for
activities
in
violation
of
institutional
rules
and
it’s
in
violation
of
institution
rules
to
agitate.
so,
i
think
that
would
still
survive.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
1205
under
the
contraband
rule
insofar
as
it
applies
to
mail
at
all.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
writings,
expressing
inflammatory,
political,
racial,
religious
other
views
or
beliefs
when
not
in
the
immediate
possession
of
the
originator.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
that
went
out
insofar
as
it
applies
to
mail.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
then,
in
2402
(8),
on
the
next
page.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i
think
the
substance
of
(f)
has
survived.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
and
the
first
paragraph
on
the
next
page.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
but
in
2402
(8)
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
defamatory
went
out
as
well
as
or
are
otherwise
inappropriate.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
it.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i
don’t
think
that’s
meant
to
be
words
your
honor.
i
think
that
substances
maybe
--
they
maybe
getting
it
drugs
or
something
of
that
matter.
these
rules
unduly
complaining
and
magnifying
grievances
and
so
on
are
relics
of
the
non-distinguished
past
in
prison
administration
and
they
are
not
needed
to
run
any
prison.
as
the
states
that
have
done
a
way
with
reading
mail
all
together
shall
and
as
the
new
report
of
the
national
advisory
commission
on
criminal
justice
standards
and
goals
shows,
indeed
the
state
has
never
said
in
this
case
that
it
has
any
interest
at
all
in
enforcing
these
particular
rules.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
correct
your
honor.
but
it
does
apply
to
letters.
we
specifically
asked
in
a
request
for
admissions,
does
this
apply
to
letters
and
the
answer
was
yes.
that’s
in
the
record.
and
certainly
the
testimony
of
the
censoring
guard
was
that
they
frequently
used
the
unduly
complaining
and
magnifying
grievances
provisions
to
censor
criticism
of
them
or
their
policies.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
correct.
that
would
be
only
the
sentence
that
the
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
correct.
what
we’re
dealing
here
--
dealing
with
here
is
just
expression,
it
is
not
obscenity,
not
libel,
not
fighting
words,
we’re
not
talking
about
conduct.
we’re
not
talking
demonstrations
or
circulating
anything
within
the
prison.
moreover,
this
is
expression
contained
in
letters
that
are
address
to
correspondents’
people
who
are
approved
by
the
department
of
corrections.
we
believe
that
the
district
court’s
conclusion
on
the
mail
censorship
rules
was
clearly
correct
and
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
not
in
this
case.
turning
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
copying
of
mail?
yes,
we
did.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no,
i'm
afraid
it
wasn’t
referring
to
page
198
of
the
supplement
to
the
appendix
under
the
rules
finally
approved
by
the
district
court.
the
officials
still
have
the
right
to
place
in
a
prisoner’s
file.
not
only
matters
that
are
in
violation
of
the
rules
but
also
anything
they
think
is
“relevant
to
assessment
of
the
inmate’s
rehabilitation”
or
just
essentially
could
mean
anything.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
we
vigorously
argued
in
the
district
court
that
they
didn’t
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes,
they
may.
turning
to
the
problem
of
investigators
working
for
lawyers,
once
again
it
is
essential
to
focus
on
exactly
what
the
district
court
did
and
what
it
didn’t
do.
compare
the
former
rule
that
was
invalidated
with
the
rules
that
were
finally
approved.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
alright.
the
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
the
old
rule.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
the
new
rule
is
at
page
--
it
begins
on
198
of
the
supplement
to
the
appendix.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes,
b,
investigators.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
now,
the
former
rule
was
an
absolute
prohibition
against
attorneys
using
either
law
students
or
paraprofessionals
for
the
purpose
of
interviewing
prisoners
whom
they
were
representing
or
considering
whether
to
represent.
this
was
to
true
regardless
of
who
the
prisoner
was,
regardless
of
who
the
lawyer
was,
regardless
of
who
the
investigator
was,
regardless
of
the
kind
of
case,
or
the
need
to
use
an
investigator
regardless
of
any
other
possibly
relevant
factor.
now,
after
the
initial
decision
of
the
district
court,
the
department
of
corrections
voluntarily
opened
the
class
of
investigators
to
permit
law
students
who’ve
been
certified
by
the
state
bar
of
california
to
serve
as
investigators.
the
only
addition
to
that
made
by
the
district
court
in
its
final
order
is
to
authorize
the
use
of
paraprofessional
persons,
who
have
been
certified
as
well
by
the
state
bar
of
california.
as
of
this
time,
there
is
no
procedure
and
no
certification
by
the
state
bar
for
paraprofessionals.
so,
the
district
court
has
not
ordered
the
department
to
do
anything
that
isn’t
doing
voluntarily
already.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
right.
they
were
ordered
to
submit
regulations
that
would
permit
the
use
of
paraprofessionals
but
they
began
voluntarily
allowing
law
students
in
before
they
were
ever
ordered
to
do
so,
months
before
they
were
ever
ordered
to
do
so.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
after
the
opinion
and
while
new
regulations
were
being
worked
out.
the
former
rule
that
barred
all
use
of
paraprofessional
assistance
to
lawyers
was
in
fact
a
serious
obstacle
to
obtaining
representation
for
indigent
prisoners.
these
prisoners
can’t
afford
either
a
lawyer
or
the
services
of
the
state
license
private
detective.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
right.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
right,
an
empty
promise.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
the
state
bar
of
california
has
recommended
legislation
just
last
summer
because
they
think
it’s
important
to
start
paraprofessional
use
in
all
aspects
in
the
practice
of
law
to
enhance
the
quality
of
legal
services
and
expand
the
number
of
people
that
services
can
be
rendered
to.
they
want
to
do
that
through
paraprofessional.
so,
i
think
they
will
get
to
it.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes.
i'm
not
sure
what
is
meant
by
that.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
local
bar
associations.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
the
right
of
access
to
the
courts
--
effective
access
to
the
courts.
it’s
the
same
right
that
was
involved
in
johnson.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
the
state
does
have
an
interest
but
that
interest
is
certainly
adequately
protected
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
as
in
johnson
against
avery
was
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
what
it
did
was
exclude
a
lot
of
people
who
could
be
very,
very
helpful.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
and
provided
they
--
they
certainly
do.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
no.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
i
wouldn’t
put
it
that
way.
it
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
certainly
not.
but
we
are
not
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
we
are
talking
about
two
different
things
right
here.
but
the
prisoners
have
a
right
of
access
to
the
courts
through
whatever
means
don’t
involved
any
problems
of
prison
security.
the
state
bar
of
california
can
certainly
promulgate
the
standards
for
professional
conduct
and
the
state
bar
has
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
the
question
is
what
are
satisfactory
qualifications
and
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
in
this
case,
the
court
below
held
that
the
state
didn’t
have
any
interest
really
in
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
that’s
because
the
prison
authorities
didn’t
attempt
to
justify
the
exclusion
of
the
people
that
the
district
court
ordered
should
be
let
in.
and
the
reason
for
the
district
court’s
order
is
because
this
rule
made
the
difference
in
very
many
cases
whether
a
lawyer
--
whether
a
prisoner
would
have
legal
representation
or
not.
in
this
very
case,
my
co-counsel
was
requested
by
federal
district
judge
to
look
into
this
case
which
had
been
filed
pro
se
by
the
prisoner
investigated
and
considered
taking
on
uncompensated
appointment.
when
she
tried
to
send
a
third
year
law
student
working
closely
under
a
supervision
to
see
the
prisoner
and
get
the
facts,
he
was
barred
by
this
very
rule
and
he
was
transferred
and
it
didn’t
happen
again.
that’s
how
this
issue
got
in
this
case
and
took
a
good
while
to
get
this
case
prepared
because
of
that
rule.
but
as
the
record
show
is
in
many
other
cases,
the
lawyers
had
been
discouraged
from
getting
involved
at
all
with
the
representation
of
prisoners
because
of
the
remoteness
of
prisons.
they
have
to
take
days
off
from
your
office
just
to
go
get
paper
signed.
they
can’t
even
send
a
messenger
to
get
paper
signed
under
this
rule.
they
have
to
go
in
person.
and
that
was
a
handicap
in
representing
california
prisoners.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
it
could
be
done
by
mail
if
the
documents
did
not
have
to
be
explained
or
show
the
prisoner
what's
in
and
so
on.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
yes.
it
is
the
personal
interview
thing
that
is
the
most
important
but
to
show
how
far
the
rule
goes
it
bars
even
going
out
to
the
prison
there
--
mr.
william
bennett
turner
under
the
old
rule.
we
submit
that
this
aspect
of
the
case
is
controlled
by
the
court’s
decision
in
johnson
v.
avery
where
the
court
struck
down
the
jailhouse
lawyer
rule
that
prohibited
prisoners
from
helping
each
other
on
legal
work.
certainly,
if
the
state’s
interest
there,
if
there’s
a
burden
on
the
state
to
justify
banning
jailhouse
lawyers
which
was
not
met
in
johnson
versus
avery,
it
ought
to
be
heavier
burden
of
justification
or
you’re
talking
about
people
who
are
closely
supervised
and
certified
by
attorneys.
there's
no
contention
--
then
no
contention
in
this
case
that
any
harm
would
ever,
would
flow
from
the
use
state
bar
certified
law
students
and
paraprofessionals
and
for
all
these
reasons
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
i
know
what
you're
referring
to.
i
suppose
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
any
of
those
events.
mr.
william
bennett
turner
well,
i
think
it
is
a
real
problem
but
the
attorney
general
has
made
a
lot
of
the
fact
that
these
interviews
will
be
confidential.
that’s
a
red
herring
because
all
interviews,
all
visits,
social,
and
other
in
california
are
confidential
but
not
monitored
at
all
--
they’re
visually
monitored.
a
guard
looks
at
you
while
you
talk
to
the
prisoner
but
nobody
is
listening.
that’s
even
true
with
social
visits.
and
it
would
be
true
with
the
paraprofessionals
as
well.
