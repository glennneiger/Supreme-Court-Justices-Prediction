unknown
speaker
and
that’s
august
8?
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
your
reply
brief?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me
mr.
--
is
there
any
question
raise
in
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
lee?
unknown
speaker
but
on
the
abstention?
do
you
have
an
abstention
case
involving
the
civil
rights
act?
unknown
speaker
since
you
wrote
your
brief,
this
rather,
luminous,
credible
reports,
using
the
reports
come
down
leading
with
this
copy;
i
wonder
if
we
can’t
look
at
it?
unknown
speaker
because
it
seems
to
be
larger
more
than
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
it
deals
only
with
recommendations.
unknown
speaker
the
appellee
is
talking
about
constitutional
rights?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
it.
this
case
involves
one
bold
fact,
i
assume,
that
is
that
the
prison
authorities
here
sends
their
letters,
outgoing
letters?
unknown
speaker
under
what
theory?
unknown
speaker
but
some
of
the
censorship
apparently
relates
to
criticism
with
the
prison
authorities?
unknown
speaker
they
didn’t
have
a
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
turner
do
you
feel
there
is
some
right
of
censorship
on
the
part
of
the
prison
authorities?
unknown
speaker
now,
let’s
see
if
i
have
you
done
correctly
understood.
i
take
it
you
are
conceding
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
case.
they
have
the
right
to
read.
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
they
have
the
right
not
to
censor
in
any
respect?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
asking
you,
is
this
that
your
position
that
they
may
read
but
may
not
censor?
unknown
speaker
and
might
you
concede
this
is
proper
then
for
purposes
of
this
case?
unknown
speaker
what
you
really
are
speaking
to
some
extent
of
the
rights
of
visitation,
are
you
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
aren’t
you
talking
about
paralegal
visitations?
unknown
speaker
you
concede
that
they
--
that
a
prison
might
have
reasonable
regulations
as
to
hours
of
visitation?
unknown
speaker
numbers
of
visitors?
unknown
speaker
now,
let
me
see
if
i
understand
that.
looking
at
the
old
rules,
these
are
the
ones
at
exhibit
c,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
to
the
appellants’
brief.
unknown
speaker
i
gather
that
the
one
on
page
roman
numeral
vi,
right
the
rule
2402
(8)
that
is
one
that
did
not
survive,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
have
you
tried
to
correlate
anywhere
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
repeat
it
again
what
you
say
survived
and
what
went
out?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
duly
complain,
magnify
grievances.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
well
that
means
that
somewhere
we
have
something
about
do
not
agitate
--
unknown
speaker
yes,
that's
wrong
to
get
but
do
not
agitate
when
they
agitate
with
mail.
but
that
still
survive,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
now,
what's
the
next?
what
about
1205?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
they
went
out?
that
went
out?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
ask
then
what
about
(f)?
1205
(f)?
unknown
speaker
has
survived.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
what
does
foreign
matter
mean
in
2402?
if
someone
writes
in
spanish,
is
that
the
one?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
unduly
complaining
of
magnified
grievances
of
that
last
sentence?
unknown
speaker
if
i
understand
that
statements
you
just
made.
the
part
when
you
say,
people
who
are
through.
does
that
mean
the
prisoner
must
provide
a
list
of
people
to
whom
he’d
like
to
write
a
letter
or
letters
and
that
list
must
be
approved
before
he
may
write
to
any
of
those
people?
unknown
speaker
you
make
no
objections
of
this?
unknown
speaker
did
you
object
to
copying?
unknown
speaker
and
was
that
not
the
--
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
they
have
a
right
to
put
into
a
--
to
copy
and
keep
every
letters
written?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
think
happen
with
under
the
rules
as
approved,
may
the
prison
be
that
enough?
unknown
speaker
your
state
bar
that
has
reference
to
the
integrated
bar,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
and
another
it
says
there
are
other
equivalent
legal
professional
body,
would
that
be
some
voluntary
bar
association?
unknown
speaker
you
do
have
in
california
some
voluntary
bar
association?
unknown
speaker
now,
what’s
the
constitutional
right
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
the
state
has
no
business
saying
they
wanted
to
guarantee
that
access
to
people
to
have
a
certain
agreed
qualification?
unknown
speaker
do
you
disagree
with
where
they
(inaudible)?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
right?
do
you
think
that
the
state
require
too
much
qualifications
for
the
people?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
still
exclude
a
lot
of
people?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
mr.
turner
you're
not
here
cross-appealing
or
anything?
unknown
speaker
you're
just
defending
this
order
with
its
deficiencies
whatever
they
may
be
at?
unknown
speaker
oh,
yes,
but
if
you
were
the
plaintiffs?
unknown
speaker
and
you
attack
this
rule
on
the
ground
that
this
--
upon
the
grounds
of
the
rules
unconstitutional
because
it
restricted
access
to
the
board,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
and
you
agree
access
to
the
courts
can
be
restricted
to
people
of
satisfactory
qualification?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you
say
that
the
state
must
have
allow
access
through
people
with
no
qualifications?
unknown
speaker
but
then
--
well,
then
you
say
with
sufficient
qualifications?
unknown
speaker
i’m
talking
about
the
prisoners.
may
the
prisoners
say,
we
will
certainly
prevent
the
access
and
to
the
boards
for
prisoners
they
agreed
they
have
a
right
but
we
insisted
they
be
through
people
of
satisfactory
qualifications?
unknown
speaker
that’s
right.
unknown
speaker
it
was
a
constitutional
matter.
i
think
that
district
court
was
perfectly
competent
to
disagree
within
it?
this
is
with
the
prison
authority
as
to
what
satisfactory
qualifications
were?
unknown
speaker
and
that’s
august
8?
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
your
reply
brief?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me
mr.
--
is
there
any
question
raise
in
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
lee?
unknown
speaker

on
the
abstention?
do
you
have
an
abstention
case
involving
the
