mr.
chief

may
it

first,
i
should

to
apologize
to

to

to
a

is

case,
august

1973
and

and
i
believe
in
that
brief.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
s-a-v-a-g-e.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
august
8,
1973.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
your
honor,
on
this
action
under
42
u.s.c
1983,
the
federal
civil
rights
act
was
brought
as
a
class
action
by
two
california
prison
inmates,
a
mr.
martinez,
who
has
since
escaped
and
is
still
at
large,
and
to
mr.
earle
(ph)
who
is
the
representative
of
the
class
of
all
california
inmates.
it’s
originally
alleged
four
class
or
general
actions
and
one
claimed
for
individual
relief.
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
2281,
three-judge
federal
panel,
considered
the
general
causes.
one
of
these
causes
involved
registered
mail
and
by
a
voluntary
action
on
the
part
of
the
director
of
the
correctional
system,
who
was
then
and
still
is
in
the
process
of
revising
these
various
regulations.
this
aspect
of
the
postal
system
was
made
available
to
inmates
and
that
mooted
the
question.
there
was
a
second
cause
that
involved
confidential
mail
from
inmates
to
attorneys.
this
too,
was
mooted
by
the
action
of
the
california
supreme
court
which
in,
in
re
7,
i
beg
your
pardon,
in,
in
re
jordan
which
is
cited
in
the
brief
interpreted
california
penal
code
section
2600
to
find
such
a
california
statutory
right
in
the
inmates
that
supported
federal
question.
the
third
individual
claim
was
brought
by
mr.
martinez
and
this
ultimately
was
mooted
out.
so,
we
are
then
left
with
two
general
causes.
the
first
was
an
attacked
on
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
on
four
california
correctional
regulations
having
to
do
directly
or
indirectly
with
the
inmates’
mail,
inmates
personal
or
inmates’
social
mail.
and
the
second
cause
was
an
attack
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment
on
access
to
the
courts,
insofar
as
california
controlled
confidential
interviews
between
inmates
and
their
attorneys
and
assistance
too.
all
these
regulations
by
the
decisions
of
the
three-judge
federal
court
where
found
to
be
undeclared,
unconstitutional
insofar
as
they
applied
to
mail
or
restricted
access
to
the
courts.
their
enforcement
was
enjoined
and
we
appealed.
in
addition,
the
director
was
ordered
to
submit
new
regulations
in
accordance
with
the
finding
of
facts
and
the
conclusions
of
law
of
the
district
court,
thus
substantive.
and
the
new
regulations
were
ultimately
approved
on
august
1,
1973,
and
they
are
now
in
effect
in
california.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
your
honor.
we
did.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
we
were
unsuccessful
in
that
endeavor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
no,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
your
honor.
we
wish
it
right
to
follow
what
we
conceive
to
be
correct
in
the
logical
concepts.
perhaps
our
first
point
is
that
the
appeal
is
properly
before
this
court.
we
rely
upon
the
statute
28
u.s.c.
1253.
this
was
in
the
words
of
the
statute
an
interlocutory
or
final
injunction
of
a
three-judge
federal
panel.
now,
in
the
brown
shoe
case,
that’s
brown
shoe
v.
united
states,
there,
a
merger
between
two
corporations
was
held
to
be
in
violation
of
the
clayton
antitrust
act
as
a
lessening
of
competition.
on
appeal,
it
was
urged
but
the
judgment
was
not
final
because
the
district
court
retained
jurisdiction
in
order
to
approve
the
plan
of
separation
of
these
corporations.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
your
honor.
the
appellants,
i
beg
your
pardon,
appellees
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
--
appears
to
raise
these
questions,
as
to
the
pre-maturity.
however,
i
will
move
quickly
on
and
state
this.
we
believe,
we
have
finding
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law,
a
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
and
injunction.
we
think,
we
can
probably
appeal.
however,
we
submit
to
you
that
the
three-judge
federal
court
should
have
abstained.
abstention
we
submit
is
appropriate
and
peculiarly
appropriate
was
not
only
are
the
regulations
challenged
and
undertook
have
not
been
interpreted
by
the
state’s
highest
court
in
our
case
of
california
supreme
court.
it
is
particularly
appropriate
where
there
is
another
and
separate
state
statute
which
if
fully
interpreted
would
provide
us
separate
and
distinct
state
ground
which
would
moot
the
federal
question.
we
assert
and
we
submit
to
you
that
that
is
our
situation.
we
do
have
a
statute
that
is
california
penal
code
section
2600.
now
in
the
railroad
commission
case,
that’s
railroad
commission
v.
pullman
and
in
the
reetz
v.
bozanich
case.
that
is
the
alaskan
constitutional
case.
in
those,
it
was
the
interpretation
of
a
either
a
state
statute
or
a
state
constitution
and
not
the
regulation
under
attack
which
fully
interpreted
would
have
mooted
federal
question
and
this
court
ordered
abstention.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
this
case
was
indeed,
your
honor,
brought
under
the
federal
civil
rights.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
not
under
the
federal
civil
rights
act,
your
honor,
no.
however,
if
any,
if
under
the
federal
constitutional
right,
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
federal
civil
rights
act,
a
constitutional
right
is
asserted
as
it
must
be
pursuant
to
cooper
v.
pate.
then
if
there
is
a
state
statute
which
will
grant
that
right
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
offhand,
no,
your
honor,
i
have
nothing
a
specific
united
states
supreme
court
which
case
to
which
i
can
refer.
but
i
do
suggest
to
you
that
no
matter
what
act
is
being
enforced.
if
it
is
a
reasonable
for
this
court
to
find
a
state
statute
which
would
avoid
the
federal
question
then
it
should
order
its
law
of
federal
courts
to
extend.
now,
in
the
cases
i’ve
seen
we
do
have
a
statute.
it’s
california
penal
code
2600
and
it
is
cited
in
our
brief
of
course.
but
i’d
like
to
read
this
one
little
section
which
is
follows,
“pursuant
to
the
provision
of
this
section,
prison
authorities
shall
have
the
authority
to
exclude
obscene
publications
or
writings,
and
mail
containing
information
where,
how,
and
from
which
such
matter
may
be
obtained,
and
any
matter
of
a
character
tending
to
incite
murder,
arson,
riot,
violent
racism,
or
any
other
form
of
violence,
and
any
matter
concerning
gambling
or
a
lottery.”
now,
this
we
say
is
the
limit
of
the
california
authority
to
exclude.
in,
in
re
harrell
at
2
cal.
3d
675,
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
this
statute,
the
one
i
just
cited
was
in
fact
the
california
inmates
bill
of
rights
and
that
the
concept
to
civil
death
had
been
abandoned
in
the
state
of
california.
we
submit,
it
could
be
fairly
argued
and
fairly
interpreted,
although,
i’d
be
frank
with
you,
it
will
be
my
duty
as
representing
the
director
to
argue
to
the
contrary
in
the
appropriate
state
court.
but
nevertheless,
it
would
be
fair
to
argue
that
the
only
exclusion
authority
of
the
california
director
is
contained
in
the
statute.
now,
as
opposed
to
this
in
their
brief,
appellee’s
argue
that
because
a
--
california
set
those
section
1419
specifically
and
for
the
first
time
put
end
to
section
2600,
the
right
of
inmates
to
send
social
mail.
that
therefore,
there
is
no
right
statutorily
in
those
inmates
to
send
social
mail.
this
may
well
be
but
we
point
out
that
in
that
same
bill
which
incidentally,
never
became
law,
but
in
that
same
bill
there
was
an
amendment
which
provided
that
the
california
authority,
the
california
correctional
authority
showed
for
the
first
time
have
specific
authority
to
excluded
writings
on
the
grounds
they
would
tend
to
incite
and
i
quote,
“disobedience
of
prison
rules.”
therefore,
we
can
argue
on
parity
with
the
appellees
that
absence
such
specific
authority
there
is
no
authority.
in
short,
we
feel
that
the
california
supreme
court
could
fairly
and
easily
and
contrary
to
the
position
that
we
would
take
in
that
court,
hold
there
was
indeed
a
california
statutory
right
in
inmates,
and
that
like
the
director
only
had
the
power
to
exclude
those
matters
specifically
referred
to
in
california
penal
code
2600.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
no,
your
honor.
we
do
not
want
the
new
regulations.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
they
might.
we
would
argue
seriously
they
should
not
but
they
might.
we
have
argued
unsuccessfully;
believe
me,
in
our
california
supreme
court
before
on
prison
regulations.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
i
see,
your
honor.
may
i
then
restate?
my
argument
is
this,
a
reasonable
and
valid
argument
could
be
made
to
the
california
supreme
court,
that
all
these
regulations,
this
act
what
might
be
called
exclusory
regulations
presently
under
attacked
are
without
authority
and
therefore,
exactly
like
in
the
railroad
commission
v.
pullman
case
where
there
are
ultra
various
acts.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
i
would.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
just
as
vigorously,
your
honor
as
here
i
am
saying
it
is
a
reasonable
argument.
your
honor,
i’d
like
to
address
myself
to
this
substantive
questions
and
that
involves
the
actual
regulations.
now,
the
forums
involved
the
mail
and
they
are
very
brief
as
follows.
rule
1205
are
all
in
the
briefs
that
are
before
you
and
this
had
to
do,
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor
--
with
1205
which
had
to
do
with
contraband
and
that
is
the
any
writings
and
i’ll
admit
some
things
which
are
inflammatory
expressing
inflammatory
political,
racial,
religious
or
other
beliefs.
and
also
is
subsection
(f)
of
that
same
rule
which
includes
writings
which
in
the
judgment
of
the
warden
or
superintendent
might
tend
to
subvert
prison
order
and
discipline.
in
addition,
there
is
an
actual
mail
regulation
which
is
--
was
also
attack
which
said
that
the
inmate
might
not
send
or
receive
letters
that
pertain
to
criminal
activities.
this
too,
also
contained
this
phrase
“that
are
lewd,
obscene,
or
defamatory
and
contain
prison
gossip
or
discussion
of
other
inmates”
and
this
aspect
too
is
attacked.
and
finally,
inmate
behavior,
which
prohibited
or
attempted
to
deter
those
who
agitate,
unduly
complain,
magnify
grievances,
or
behave
in
any
way
which
might
lead
to
violence.
it
is
about
these
regulations
that
we
are
talking
today.
now,
we
do
concede
and
agree
that
certain
specific
federal
constitutional
rights
do
indeed
follow
an
inmate
inside
the
prison
involved.
these
include
for
example,
the
right
of
access
to
the
courts,
the
right
now
to
suffer
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
and
indeed
perhaps
the
right
to
exercise
religion.
but
we
ask
this
question
and
that
is,
“do
the
first
amendment
rights,
as
we
popularly
understand
them,
that
is
the
right
communicate
and
receive
ideas
and
to
assemble
for
the
purposes
of
doing
so,
does
these
rights
follow
the
inmate
within
the
prison
environment?
our
first
position
is
that
these
do
not
and
we
say
was
the
fifth
circuit
rule
in
the
frye
v.
henderson,
again
it’s
cited
in
our
brief.
that
social
mail
is
not
a
federal
constitutional
right
but
is
a
matter
of
prison
administration.
now,
we
say
this
realizing
that
in
that
event
there
can
be
no
federal
burden
upon
us
to
justify
the
regulations
if
there
is
no
underlying
federal
right.
and
we
say
because,
we
believe
that
the
underpinning
of
those
first
amendment
rights
does
not
exist.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
no,
your
honor.
not
because
they
are
in
prison,
although,
that
is
the
resultant
situation
but
for
this
reason.
as
we
understand
it,
the
basic
underpinning
of
these
rights
on
which
i
think
it’s
judge
learned
hand
said,
“if
we
stake
our
all
in
the
proposition
that
in
the
free
society,
it
is
best
to
expose
people
to
a
free
market
place
of
ideas
and
our
fundamental
belief
is
that
from
this
clash
of
beliefs
good,
bad,
and
indifferent
from
this
exposure,
that
ultimately
long
term
such
a
free
society
will
only
choose,
or
will
choose
ultimately
beliefs
which
will
improve
in
our
wellness,
increase
or
enlightenment
and
protect
the
very
freedoms
that
permit
them
to
choose.”
put
another
way,
perhaps
we
might
say
that
the
highest
aspect
of
social
wisdom
is
the
long-term
collective
judgment
to
free
people.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
your
honor,
the
people,
the
persons
who
are
--
had
been
convicted
and
imprisoned
have
selected
themselves
out
of
such
a
free
society.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
by
the
acts.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
indeed
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
of
course,
he
may
write
letters.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
it
would
depend
on
the
kind
of
mail.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
oh,
no,
your
honor.
no.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
when
it
did
first
get
the
right?
your
honor,
i
would
submit
--
may
i
approach
that
backwards
and
say,
it
certainly
true
that
it
has
a
right
to
stop
the
writing
of
letters.
and
of
course,
i'm
excluding
such
letters
as
access
to
the
courts
and
the
like.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
and
letters
shall
we
say,
to
the
california
legislators.
again,
that’s
a
california
statutory
right
and
other
similar
rights.
but
when
that
person
is
finally
imprisoned
within
this
controlled
environment,
it
is
precisely
that.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes.
the
answer
is
yes.
the
answer
is
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
because
your
honor,
and
this
is
why
i
digress,
perhaps.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
no.
not
--
yes,
yes
that’s
true.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
he
gave
up
this
particular
first
amendment
rights
when
he
committed
a
crime
because
the
underpinning
disappeared.
you
see,
i'm
suggesting
this.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
no,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
because
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
no,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
is
this,
the
basic
underpinning
for
the
right
is,
i
believe
as
i
have
stated
but
ultimately
in
a
free
society
this
collective
judgment
will
be
made
correctly.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
that
is
true
your
honor.
it
is
merely
a
concomitant,
the
same
thing.
and
we
believe
that
these
people
when
they
have
got
into
that
situation
will
not
ultimately
choose
correctly
as
we
do
for
a
free
society.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
no,
i
regret
not
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
my
point
is
this
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
precisely,
your
honor
and
this
is
why
i
say
that
we
are
not
talking
about
constitutional
right.
it
may
well
be
a
mis
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
your
honor.
the
constitutional
right
is
when
this
court
delineates
it.
we
may
well
and
i
notice
my
white
light
on
and
i’m
anxious
to
get
to
one
of
the
point,
your
honor.
we
may
well
have
different
penological
concepts
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
appellee
is
right.
but
such
is
not
the
question
before
this
court.
the
question
is
“are
we
federally
compelled
to
follow
a
particular
recommendation?”
mr.
w.
eric
collins
they
do
indeed.
they
do
and
they
should.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
under
the
theory
that
they
are
controlling
and
guiding
the
environment
of
the
person
committed
to
their
care.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
very
well,
your
honor.
the
argument
is
made
that
this
is
a
stifling
of
criticism.
we
say
that’s
not
true.
first,
there
is
ample
way
in
which
criticisms
can
be
made
in
a
totally
confidential
and
protected
manner.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
a
california
statutory
right
to
do
so
under
section
2600.
we
merely
say
this,
that
when
it
comes
to
social
mails
as
opposed
to
this
confidential
mail,
no,
there
is
not
such
your
honor.
not
a
federal
constitutional
right.
your
honor,
i
have
not
reach
the
last
point,
i
like
to
touch
very
quickly
on
this.
we
have
no
objection
to
such
to
paraprofessionals
to
the
contrary.
but
we
ask,
it
is
federal
right
or
just
under
federal
compulsion
that
california
must
admit
paraprofessionals
with
the
privileges
of
attorneys
to
california
prisons
especially,
when
that
class
has
not
yet
been
delineated.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
as
yet,
not.
our
basic
concept
is
this,
the
person
who
wishes
to
take
part
in
this
relaxation
of
security
and
the
burden
that
places
on
to
make
this,
must
have
something
more
to
lose
than
simply
the
sanctions
of
criminal
law.
we
want
them
to
be
subject
to
professional
discipline
whether
standards
of
conduct
are
higher
or
the
standard
to
proof
is
lower
and
were
impartial
and
this
person
appears
will
judge
of
their
conduct.
your
honor,
i
believe
i’ve
only
two
minutes
at
most
left.
i
like
to
reserve
that
two
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
your
honor.
first,
may
i
say,
that
counsel
is
under
certain
misapprehensions.
to
answer
justice
rehnquist,
it
is
true
we
did
submit
new
regulation
regarding
law
students
but
that
was
not
done
voluntarily.
it
was
done
on
the
compulsion
of
the
finding
of
fact
in
conclusions
of
law
of
the
court.
second,
it
is
--
he
is
mistaken
when
he
says
that
we
do
not
monitor
any
nonconfidential
interviews.
that
is
not
true.
we
do
and
we
reserve
the
right
to
do
so
in
all
nonconfidential
interviews.
i
agree
counsel
may
be
speaking
from
his
personal
experience
but
that
we
submit
is
not
contrary.
your
honor,
we
think
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
no.
not
in
any
sense,
your
honor.
that
is
the
point.
it
is
completely
confidential.
that
is
confidential.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
anything
else
may
be.
we
do
not
normally
and
that
counsel
is
correct.
in
that
statement
we
do
not
normally,
but
we
do
occasionally
and
we
reserve
the
right
to
say
to
you.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
your
honor,
let
me
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
no.
unless
it’s
a
confidential
interview
and
then
he
knows
he
is
not
being
monitored.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
all.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
correct
your
honor.
precisely.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
this
court.
first,
i
should
like
to
apologize
to
the
court
and
to
draw
attention
to
a
mistaken
reply
brief.
an
omission

it
is
a

case,
august

1973
and
has
been

by
counsel
for
appellees
and
i
believe
in
that
brief.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
sir.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
s-a-v-a-g-e.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
august
8,
1973.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
your
honor,
on
this
action
under
42
u.s.c
1983,
the
federal
civil
rights
act
was
brought
as
a
class
action
by
two
california
prison
inmates,
a
mr.
martinez,
who
has
since
escaped
and
is
still
at
large,
and
to
mr.
earle
(ph)
who
is
the
representative
of
the
class
of
all
california
inmates.
it’s
originally
alleged
four
class
or
general
actions
and
one
claimed
for
individual
relief.
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
2281,
three-judge
federal
panel,
considered
the
general
causes.
one
of
these
causes
involved
registered
mail
and
by
a
voluntary
action
on
the
part
of
the
director
of
the
correctional
system,
who
was
then
and
still
is
in
the
process
of
revising
these
various
regulations.
this
aspect
of
the
postal
system
was
made
available
to
inmates
and
that
mooted
the
question.
there
was
a
second
cause
that
involved
confidential
mail
from
inmates
to
attorneys.
this
too,
was
mooted
by
the
action
of
the
california
supreme
court
which
in,
in
re
7,
i
beg
your
pardon,
in,
in
re
jordan
which
is
cited
in
the
brief
interpreted
california
penal
code
section
2600
to
find
such
a
california
statutory
right
in
the
inmates
that
supported
federal
question.
the
third
individual
claim
was
brought
by
mr.
martinez
and
this
ultimately
was
mooted
out.
so,
we
are
then
left
with
two
general
causes.
the
first
was
an
attacked
on
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
on
four
california
correctional
regulations
having
to
do
directly
or
indirectly
with
the
inmates’
mail,
inmates
personal
or
inmates’
social
mail.
and
the
second
cause
was
an
attack
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendment
on
access
to
the
courts,
insofar
as
california
controlled
confidential
interviews
between
inmates
and
their
attorneys
and
assistance
too.
all
these
regulations
by
the
decisions
of
the
three-judge
federal
court
where
found
to
be
undeclared,
unconstitutional
insofar
as
they
applied
to
mail
or
restricted
access
to
the
courts.
their
enforcement
was
enjoined
and
we
appealed.
in
addition,
the
director
was
ordered
to
submit
new
regulations
in
accordance
with
the
finding
of
facts
and
the
conclusions
of
law
of
the
district
court,
thus
substantive.
and
the
new
regulations
were
ultimately
approved
on
august
1,
1973,
and
they
are
now
in
effect
in
california.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
your
honor.
we
did.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
we
were
unsuccessful
in
that
endeavor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
no,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
your
honor.
we
wish
it
right
to
follow
what
we
conceive
to
be
correct
in
the
logical
concepts.
perhaps
our
first
point
is
that
the
appeal
is
properly
before
this
court.
we
rely
upon
the
statute
28
u.s.c.
1253.
this
was
in
the
words
of
the
statute
an
interlocutory
or
final
injunction
of
a
three-judge
federal
panel.
now,
in
the
brown
shoe
case,
that’s
brown
shoe
v.
united
states,
there,
a
merger
between
two
corporations
was
held
to
be
in
violation
of
the
clayton
antitrust
act
as
a
lessening
of
competition.
on
appeal,
it
was
urged
but
the
judgment
was
not
final
because
the
district
court
retained
jurisdiction
in
order
to
approve
the
plan
of
separation
of
these
corporations.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
your
honor.
the
appellants,
i
beg
your
pardon,
appellees
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
--
appears
to
raise
these
questions,
as
to
the
pre-maturity.
however,
i
will
move
quickly
on
and
state
this.
we
believe,
we
have
finding
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law,
a
declaration
of
unconstitutionality
and
injunction.
we
think,
we
can
probably
appeal.
however,
we
submit
to
you
that
the
three-judge
federal
court
should
have
abstained.
abstention
we
submit
is
appropriate
and
peculiarly
appropriate
was
not
only
are
the
regulations
challenged
and
undertook
have
not
been
interpreted
by
the
state’s
highest
court
in
our
case
of
california
supreme
court.
it
is
particularly
appropriate
where
there
is
another
and
separate
state
statute
which
if
fully
interpreted
would
provide
us
separate
and
distinct
state
ground
which
would
moot
the
federal
question.
we
assert
and
we
submit
to
you
that
that
is
our
situation.
we
do
have
a
statute
that
is
california
penal
code
section
2600.
now
in
the
railroad
commission
case,
that’s
railroad
commission
v.
pullman
and
in
the
reetz
v.
bozanich
case.
that
is
the
alaskan
constitutional
case.
in
those,
it
was
the
interpretation
of
a
either
a
state
statute
or
a
state
constitution
and
not
the
regulation
under
attack
which
fully
interpreted
would
have
mooted
federal
question
and
this
court
ordered
abstention.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
this
case
was
indeed,
your
honor,
brought
under
the
federal
civil
rights.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
not
under
the
federal
civil
rights
act,
your
honor,
no.
however,
if
any,
if
under
the
federal
constitutional
right,
i
beg
your
pardon,
the
federal
civil
rights
act,
a
constitutional
right
is
asserted
as
it
must
be
pursuant
to
cooper
v.
pate.
then
if
there
is
a
state
statute
which
will
grant
that
right
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
offhand,
no,
your
honor,
i
have
nothing
a
specific
united
states
supreme
court
which
case
to
which
i
can
refer.
but
i
do
suggest
to
you
that
no
matter
what
act
is
being
enforced.
if
it
is
a
reasonable
for
this
court
to
find
a
state
statute
which
would
avoid
the
federal
question
then
it
should
order
its
law
of
federal
courts
to
extend.
now,
in
the
cases
i’ve
seen
we
do
have
a
statute.
it’s
california
penal
code
2600
and
it
is
cited
in
our
brief
of
course.
but
i’d
like
to
read
this
one
little
section
which
is
follows,
“pursuant
to
the
provision
of
this
section,
prison
authorities
shall
have
the
authority
to
exclude
obscene
publications
or
writings,
and
mail
containing
information
where,
how,
and
from
which
such
matter
may
be
obtained,
and
any
matter
of
a
character
tending
to
incite
murder,
arson,
riot,
violent
racism,
or
any
other
form
of
violence,
and
any
matter
concerning
gambling
or
a
lottery.”
now,
this
we
say
is
the
limit
of
the
california
authority
to
exclude.
in,
in
re
harrell
at
2
cal.
3d
675,
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
this
statute,
the
one
i
just
cited
was
in
fact
the
california
inmates
bill
of
rights
and
that
the
concept
to
civil
death
had
been
abandoned
in
the
state
of
california.
we
submit,
it
could
be
fairly
argued
and
fairly
interpreted,
although,
i’d
be
frank
with
you,
it
will
be
my
duty
as
representing
the
director
to
argue
to
the
contrary
in
the
appropriate
state
court.
but
nevertheless,
it
would
be
fair
to
argue
that
the
only
exclusion
authority
of
the
california
director
is
contained
in
the
statute.
now,
as
opposed
to
this
in
their
brief,
appellee’s
argue
that
because
a
--
california
set
those
section
1419
specifically
and
for
the
first
time
put
end
to
section
2600,
the
right
of
inmates
to
send
social
mail.
that
therefore,
there
is
no
right
statutorily
in
those
inmates
to
send
social
mail.
this
may
well
be
but
we
point
out
that
in
that
same
bill
which
incidentally,
never
became
law,
but
in
that
same
bill
there
was
an
amendment
which
provided
that
the
california
authority,
the
california
correctional
authority
showed
for
the
first
time
have
specific
authority
to
excluded
writings
on
the
grounds
they
would
tend
to
incite
and
i
quote,
“disobedience
of
prison
rules.”
therefore,
we
can
argue
on
parity
with
the
appellees
that
absence
such
specific
authority
there
is
no
authority.
in
short,
we
feel
that
the
california
supreme
court
could
fairly
and
easily
and
contrary
to
the
position
that
we
would
take
in
that
court,
hold
there
was
indeed
a
california
statutory
right
in
inmates,
and
that
like
the
director
only
had
the
power
to
exclude
those
matters
specifically
referred
to
in
california
penal
code
2600.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
no,
your
honor.
we
do
not
want
the
new
regulations.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
they
might.
we
would
argue
seriously
they
should
not
but
they
might.
we
have
argued
unsuccessfully;
believe
me,
in
our
california
supreme
court
before
on
prison
regulations.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
i
see,
your
honor.
may
i
then
restate?
my
argument
is
this,
a
reasonable
and
valid
argument
could
be
made
to
the
california
supreme
court,
that
all
these
regulations,
this
act
what
might
be
called
exclusory
regulations
presently
under
attacked
are
without
authority
and
therefore,
exactly
like
in
the
railroad
commission
v.
pullman
case
where
there
are
ultra
various
acts.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
that
is
correct
your
honor.
and
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
i
would.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
just
as
vigorously,
your
honor
as
here
i
am
saying
it
is
a
reasonable
argument.
your
honor,
i’d
like
to
address
myself
to
this
substantive
questions
and
that
involves
the
actual
regulations.
now,
the
forums
involved
the
mail
and
they
are
very
brief
as
follows.
rule
1205
are
all
in
the
briefs
that
are
before
you
and
this
had
to
do,
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor
--
with
1205
which
had
to
do
with
contraband
and
that
is
the
any
writings
and
i’ll
admit
some
things
which
are
inflammatory
expressing
inflammatory
political,
racial,
religious
or
other
beliefs.
and
also
is
subsection
(f)
of
that
same
rule
which
includes
writings
which
in
the
judgment
of
the
warden
or
superintendent
might
tend
to
subvert
prison
order
and
discipline.
in
addition,
there
is
an
actual
mail
regulation
which
is
--
was
also
attack
which
said
that
the
inmate
might
not
send
or
receive
letters
that
pertain
to
criminal
activities.
this
too,
also
contained
this
phrase
“that
are
lewd,
obscene,
or
defamatory
and
contain
prison
gossip
or
discussion
of
other
inmates”
and
this
aspect
too
is
attacked.
and
finally,
inmate
behavior,
which
prohibited
or
attempted
to
deter
those
who
agitate,
unduly
complain,
magnify
grievances,
or
behave
in
any
way
which
might
lead
to
violence.
it
is
about
these
regulations
that
we
are
talking
today.
now,
we
do
concede
and
agree
that
certain
specific
federal
constitutional
rights
do
indeed
follow
an
inmate
inside
the
prison
involved.
these
include
for
example,
the
right
of
access
to
the
courts,
the
right
now
to
suffer
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
and
indeed
perhaps
the
right
to
exercise
religion.
but
we
ask
this
question
and
that
is,
“do
the
first
amendment
rights,
as
we
popularly
understand
them,
that
is
the
right
communicate
and
receive
ideas
and
to
assemble
for
the
purposes
of
doing
so,
does
these
rights
follow
the
inmate
within
the
prison
environment?
our
first
position
is
that
these
do
not
and
we
say
was
the
fifth
circuit
rule
in
the
frye
v.
henderson,
again
it’s
cited
in
our
brief.
that
social
mail
is
not
a
federal
constitutional
right
but
is
a
matter
of
prison
administration.
now,
we
say
this
realizing
that
in
that
event
there
can
be
no
federal
burden
upon
us
to
justify
the
regulations
if
there
is
no
underlying
federal
right.
and
we
say
because,
we
believe
that
the
underpinning
of
those
first
amendment
rights
does
not
exist.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
no,
your
honor.
not
because
they
are
in
prison,
although,
that
is
the
resultant
situation
but
for
this
reason.
as
we
understand
it,
the
basic
underpinning
of
these
rights
on
which
i
think
it’s
judge
learned
hand
said,
“if
we
stake
our
all
in
the
proposition
that
in
the
free
society,
it
is
best
to
expose
people
to
a
free
market
place
of
ideas
and
our
fundamental
belief
is
that
from
this
clash
of
beliefs
good,
bad,
and
indifferent
from
this
exposure,
that
ultimately
long
term
such
a
free
society
will
only
choose,
or
will
choose
ultimately
beliefs
which
will
improve
in
our
wellness,
increase
or
enlightenment
and
protect
the
very
freedoms
that
permit
them
to
choose.”
put
another
way,
perhaps
we
might
say
that
the
highest
aspect
of
social
wisdom
is
the
long-term
collective
judgment
to
free
people.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
your
honor,
the
people,
the
persons
who
are
--
had
been
convicted
and
imprisoned
have
selected
themselves
out
of
such
a
free
society.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
by
the
acts.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
indeed
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
of
course,
he
may
write
letters.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
it
would
depend
on
the
kind
of
mail.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
oh,
no,
your
honor.
no.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
when
it
did
first
get
the
right?
your
honor,
i
would
submit
--
may
i
approach
that
backwards
and
say,
it
certainly
true
that
it
has
a
right
to
stop
the
writing
of
letters.
and
of
course,
i'm
excluding
such
letters
as
access
to
the
courts
and
the
like.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
and
letters
shall
we
say,
to
the
california
legislators.
again,
that’s
a
california
statutory
right
and
other
similar
rights.
but
when
that
person
is
finally
imprisoned
within
this
controlled
environment,
it
is
precisely
that.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes.
the
answer
is
yes.
the
answer
is
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
because
your
honor,
and
this
is
why
i
digress,
perhaps.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
no.
not
--
yes,
yes
that’s
true.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
he
gave
up
this
particular
first
amendment
rights
when
he
committed
a
crime
because
the
underpinning
disappeared.
you
see,
i'm
suggesting
this.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
no,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
because
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
no,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
is
this,
the
basic
underpinning
for
the
right
is,
i
believe
as
i
have
stated
but
ultimately
in
a
free
society
this
collective
judgment
will
be
made
correctly.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
that
is
true
your
honor.
it
is
merely
a
concomitant,
the
same
thing.
and
we
believe
that
these
people
when
they
have
got
into
that
situation
will
not
ultimately
choose
correctly
as
we
do
for
a
free
society.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
no,
i
regret
not
your
honor.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
my
point
is
this
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
precisely,
your
honor
and
this
is
why
i
say
that
we
are
not
talking
about
constitutional
right.
it
may
well
be
a
mis
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
your
honor.
the
constitutional
right
is
when
this
court
delineates
it.
we
may
well
and
i
notice
my
white
light
on
and
i’m
anxious
to
get
to
one
of
the
point,
your
honor.
we
may
well
have
different
penological
concepts
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
appellee
is
right.
but
such
is
not
the
question
before
this
court.
the
question
is
“are
we
federally
compelled
to
follow
a
particular
recommendation?”
mr.
w.
eric
collins
they
do
indeed.
they
do
and
they
should.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
under
the
theory
that
they
are
controlling
and
guiding
the
environment
of
the
person
committed
to
their
care.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
very
well,
your
honor.
the
argument
is
made
that
this
is
a
stifling
of
criticism.
we
say
that’s
not
true.
first,
there
is
ample
way
in
which
criticisms
can
be
made
in
a
totally
confidential
and
protected
manner.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
a
california
statutory
right
to
do
so
under
section
2600.
we
merely
say
this,
that
when
it
comes
to
social
mails
as
opposed
to
this
confidential
mail,
no,
there
is
not
such
your
honor.
not
a
federal
constitutional
right.
your
honor,
i
have
not
reach
the
last
point,
i
like
to
touch
very
quickly
on
this.
we
have
no
objection
to
such
to
paraprofessionals
to
the
contrary.
but
we
ask,
it
is
federal
right
or
just
under
federal
compulsion
that
california
must
admit
paraprofessionals
with
the
privileges
of
attorneys
to
california
prisons
especially,
when
that
class
has
not
yet
been
delineated.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
as
yet,
not.
our
basic
concept
is
this,
the
person
who
wishes
to
take
part
in
this
relaxation
of
security
and
the
burden
that
places
on
to
make
this,
must
have
something
more
to
lose
than
simply
the
sanctions
of
criminal
law.
we
want
them
to
be
subject
to
professional
discipline
whether
standards
of
conduct
are
higher
or
the
standard
to
proof
is
lower
and
were
impartial
and
this
person
appears
will
judge
of
their
conduct.
your
honor,
i
believe
i’ve
only
two
minutes
at
most
left.
i
like
to
reserve
that
two
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
yes,
your
honor.
first,
may
i
say,
that
counsel
is
under
certain
misapprehensions.
to
answer
justice
rehnquist,
it
is
true
we
did
submit
new
regulation
regarding
law
students
but
that
was
not
done
voluntarily.
it
was
done
on
the
compulsion
of
the
finding
of
fact
in
conclusions
of
law
of
the
court.
second,
it
is
--
he
is
mistaken
when
he
says
that
we
do
not
monitor
any
nonconfidential
interviews.
that
is
not
true.
we
do
and
we
reserve
the
right
to
do
so
in
all
nonconfidential
interviews.
i
agree
counsel
may
be
speaking
from
his
personal
experience
but
that
we
submit
is
not
contrary.
your
honor,
we
think
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
no.
not
in
any
sense,
your
honor.
that
is
the
point.
it
is
completely
confidential.
that
is
confidential.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
anything
else
may
be.
we
do
not
normally
and
that
counsel
is
correct.
in
that
statement
we
do
not
normally,
but
we
do
occasionally
and
we
reserve
the
right
to
say
to
you.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
your
honor,
let
me
--
mr.
w.
eric
collins
no.
unless
it’s
a
confidential
interview
and
then
he
knows
he
is
not
being
monitored.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
all.
mr.
w.
eric
collins
correct
your
honor.
precisely.
