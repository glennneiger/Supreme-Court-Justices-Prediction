justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
let’s
see,
the
exceptions.
what
do
you
mean
the
exceptions?
you
mean
only
the
exception
for
fighting
words?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
for
fighting
words
that
is
tend
to
incite
to
an
immediate
breach
of
peace.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
lewd
and
obscene,
the
profane,
the
libelous?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
say
that’s
what
chaplinsky
stands
for?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
gooding
did
not
give
that
interpretation
to
it,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
it
did,
did
it?
i
thought
gooding
interpreted
that
chaplinsky
as
limiting
in
this
context
a
state
power
to
make
criminal
of
the
use
of
utterance
which
tends
to
incite
to
an
immediate
breach
of
the
peace,
didn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
and
is
that
what
this
case
is
all
about
then?
don’t
you
stand
therefore
on
whether
or
not
your
court
has
narrowed
the
statute
to
such
words?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
case
we
reverse
appellant's
convictions
under
new
orleans
ordinance
for
addressing
vulgar
spoken
words
to
a
new
orleans
police
officer.
we
hold
that
the
new
orleans
ordinance
is
facially
unconstitutional
because
as
construed
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
it's
over
broad
and
it's
not
limited
to
punishing
fighting
words
as
defined
in
our
decisions
in
chaplinsky
and
gooding.
mr.
justice
powell
concurs
in
the
result,
he
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.

justice
