unknown

mr.
reed.
unknown
speaker
the
chaplinsky
definition
of
fighting
words
and
the
one
i
reaffirmed
in
gooding
was
words
which
by
there
very
utterance
tend
to
emphasize
an
immediate
breach
of
peace.
now,
i
follow
your
argument
that
these
words
could
not
incite
a
police
officer
to
immediate
breach
of
peace.
but
apart
from
the
police
officer,
what’s
the
meaning
of
what
louisiana
supreme
court
said
in
this
sentence?
we
find
--
i
am
reading
from
page
56
of
your
appendix,
we
find
that
section
49-7
is
not
offensive
to
protective
speech.
it
is
narrowed
to
fighting
words
uttered
to
specific
persons
at
a
specific
time.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
not
withstanding
the
quote
from
chaplinsky
actually,
the
ordinance
is
read
to
embrace
more
than
just
words
that
would
provoke
or
incite
to
an
immediate
breach
of
peace.
unknown
speaker
now,
where
is
that
in
the
opinion?
unknown
speaker
this
is
right
following
that
sentence
--
unknown
speaker
--
of
56.
unknown
speaker
well
tell
me
this,
if
in
fact
this
ordinance
were
limited
to
words
tending
to
incite
an
immediate
breach
of
the
peace.
and
not
a
police
officer
but
some
private
citizen
was
the
one
to
whom
the
words
were
addressed,
would
the
words
used
here
--
unknown
speaker
--
been
fighting
words?
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
addressed
to
language
used
to
the
police.
unknown
speaker
and
at
the
very
least,
the
state
court
has
decided
that
the
police
aren’t
any
less
insensitive
than
anybody
else.
they
are
not
less
sensitive
or
any
more
insensitive.
unknown
speaker
but
let’s
assume
that
the
--
let’s
assume
their
very
opinion
was
construable
in
limiting
the
statute
to
those
words
at
a
normal
circumstances
would
incite
–would
tend
to
incite
to
immediate
violence.
do
you
think
these
words
addressed
to
an
ordinary
citizen
would
--
might
very
well
be
fighting
words?
now
if
the
state
court
--
your
argument
is
that
the
first
amendment
would
forbid
a
state
legislature
or
a
state
court
from
saying
that
these
words
addressed
to
a
policeman
are
fighting?
unknown
speaker
my
question
was
whether
you
are
arguing
at
the
first
amendment
would
prevent
a
legislature
from
saying,
we
do
not
see
any
difference
between
the
policemen
and
the
ordinary
citizen.
it
will
take
him
all
the
circumstances
but
policemen
are
like
citizens.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
police
court
judge
or
police
court
jury
harbour
the
issue
of
fact
was
tried
in
the
court
of
initial
jurisdiction
had
made
a
finding
that
he
found
in
fact
these
were
fighting
words
as
defined
in
chaplinsky
again
gooding?
would
that
at
least
remove
one
prong
of
your
argument
here?
unknown
speaker
why
didn’t
they
have
a
record
before
them?
we
have
it
here.
unknown
speaker
the
first
time
around
here,
they
said
writ
refused,
the
judgment
is
correct
or
something
like
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
didn’t
ask
that
the
record
be
brought
up
to
them.
but
then
when
the
first
case
first
came
to
us,
we
have
the
record.
unknown
speaker
but
on
our
remand,
the
record
went
back
to
the
police
court,
municipal
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
reed,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
you.
i
have
the
appendix
here.
the
evidence
is
reproduced
in
the
appendix.
so
you
are
saying
this
was
not
before
the
court
on
this
remand?
unknown
speaker
i
saw
that
but
does
that
mean
that
even
this
portion
of
the
record
was
not
before
the
court
--
this
portion
being
what
you
have
in
the
appendix,
which
has
some
of
the
testimony
of
witnesses?
unknown
speaker
that
was
not.
the
only
thing
they
have
is
what
we
sent
out.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that’s
true,
why
did
it
limit
it
to
police
officer?
unknown
speaker
please
the
mayor
of
new
orleans,
without
being
funny?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
ordinance
that
protects
it
from
being
incurred?
unknown
speaker
it
applied
to
everybody?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
other
group
that
the
police
single
out
for
this
special
treatment
in
new
orleans?
unknown
speaker
as
to
the
overbreadth
does
it
applies
to
detectives?
unknown
speaker
i
say
on
the
question
of
overbreadth,
do
this
ordinance
apply
to
detectives,
member
of
the
city
police?
unknown
speaker
so
if
a
detective
walks
down
a
street
and
somebody
calls
him
m.f.,
that’s
it?
unknown
speaker
and
if
he
and
the
mayor
walking
side
by
side,
he
could
be
--
he’s
been
hurt
but
the
mayor
hasn’t?
unknown
speaker
yes
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
why
it
is
special
for
the
police?
unknown
speaker
how
many
of
these
--
while
you
were
prosecuting
--
how
many
of
these
cases
do
you
have
a
week?
unknown
speaker
50%.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
the
statute
has
been
on
vote
for
70
years.
unknown
speaker
so
what
about
all
of
this
new
business
you
are
talking
about,
it
needed
its
way
seven
years
ago.
unknown
speaker
well
it
could
be
that
the
police
can
arrest
them
for
anything
else
so
they
arrest
them
for
this?
unknown
speaker
so
rather
to
do
that,
they
get
them
on
this
one?
unknown
speaker
well
if
they
got
50%
of
them
that’s
a
pretty
good
percentage.
unknown
speaker
mr.
garcia,
i
didn’t
understand
you
to
say
that
50%
of
all
the
cases
in
the
police
court
in
new
orleans,
louisiana
are
brought
under
this
ordinance.
i
don't
understood
you
to
say
rather
that
in
your
observation
just
estimating
that
in
about
half
of
cases
in
that
court
involves
circumstances
in
which
there
was
some
reviling
of
the
police?
unknown
speaker
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
how
many
prosecutions
under
this
ordinance
would
you
guess
again?
unknown
speaker
it
does.
unknown
speaker
it
does.
unknown
speaker
so,
the
answer
is
still
the
same?
unknown
speaker
yes,
well,
i
misunderstood
you.
my
brother
marshall
understood
you
exactly
correctly?
unknown
speaker
what’s
the
volume?
unknown
speaker
15
to
20
of
them
are
prosecutions
out
of
this
ordinance?
unknown
speaker
relationship
that’s
strained
between
the
police
and
the
--
unknown
speaker
the
dissenting
opinion
said
and
pointed
out
in
this
case
that
under
the
terms
of
the
ordinance,
this
mother,
mrs.
lewis
could
have
been
prosecuted.
the
mother
is
punishable
under
the
ordinance
and
i’m
reading
for
using
the
disrespectful
language
in
their
own
living
room
as
well
as
in
the
street
and
not
in
the
presence
even
of
a
police.
and
that
in
reading
the
court
opinion,
i
can’t
find
any
disagreement
with
that
construction
of
the
ordinance,
would
that
be
--
unknown
speaker
or
is
there
--
have
i
missed
something
first
of
all
in
the
court
opinion?
unknown
speaker
where
are
these
overbreadth
guidelines?
is
this
something
from
the
new
orleans
police
department
or
guidelines?
unknown
speaker
[laughter]
they
read
that
in
new
orleans?
unknown
speaker
what
page
is
that?
unknown
speaker
you
are
referring
this
to
the
argument
that
you
have
read
yourself?
unknown
speaker
oh!
you
read
it.
unknown
speaker
and
why
doesn’t
it
--
do
you
have
anything
in
the
yale
law
review
why
you
have
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
point
is
that
this
case
was
here
once
before.
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
remanded
to
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
to
reconsider
in
the
light
of
gooding
and
with
an
invitation
to
narrow
it,
the
statute,
to
construe
it
in
a
narrow
way.
and
as
i
read
the
court’s
opinion,
it
not
only
declined
that
invitation
but
left
it
just
as
open
as
the
dissenting
opinion
said
it
is.
and
he
uses
another
example
of
the
fellow
on
the
balcony
looking
down
at
the
traffic
policeman
trying
to
regulate
the
traffic
in
the
french
quarter
and
says,
“look
at
that
stupid
cop
down
there,
making
an
ass
out
of
himself”
or
whatever
it
is
and
then
he
is
guilty
of
--
he
is
clearly
violating
this
ordinance.
and
there’s
--
particularly
with
the
invitation
before
the
highest
court
of
your
state
to
narrow
this
ordinance
i
would
have
thought
they
might
have
take
an
issue
with
the
dissenter’s
characterization
of
the
ordinance
as
they
had
not
agreed
with
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.

unknown

the

it
in
a
narrow
way.
and
as
i
read
the
court’s
opinion,
it
not
only
declined
that
invitation
but
left
it
just
as
open
as
the
dissenting
opinion
said
it
is.
and
he
uses
another
example
of
the
fellow
on
the
balcony
looking
down
at
the
traffic
policeman
trying
to
regulate
the
traffic
in
the
french
quarter
and
says,
“look
at
that
stupid
cop
down
there,
making
an
ass
out
of
himself”
or
whatever
it
is
and
then
he
is
guilty
of
--
he
is
clearly
violating
this
ordinance.
and
there’s
--
particularly
with
the
invitation
before
the
highest
court
of
your
state
to
narrow
this
ordinance
i
would
have
thought
they
might
have
take
an
issue
with
the
dissenter’s
characterization
of
the
ordinance
as
they
had
not
agreed
with
it.
