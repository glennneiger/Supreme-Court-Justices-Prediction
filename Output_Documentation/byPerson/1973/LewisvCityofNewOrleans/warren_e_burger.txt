we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
72-6156,
lewis
against
new
orleans.
mr.
reed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
can
assume
that
we
know
the
facts
of
your
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
stride
into
it,
if
you
will.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
in
a
heated
exchange
of
that
kind,
people
undertake
to
dissect
in
parts
and
analyze
these
things
as
we
are
doing
up
here
now
properly
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
makes
it
tolerable
and
acceptable
then?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
chaplinsky
situation
fraught
to
its
attention,
wasn’t
that
an
expression
in
anger?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
that
an
excuse
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wasn’t
that
tied
to
a
construction
given,
i
think
by
the
georgia
court
at
an
earlier
date?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
word
racketeer
is
redundant
in
the
city
in
the
metropolitan
area?
[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
is
a
factor
to
be
considered
when
in
balancing
this
idea
that
a
policeman
should
be
prepared
to
take
more
than
an
ordinary
citizen?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
the
question
is
who
--
as
i
understand
fighting
words,
it’s
the
person
to
whom
the
words
are
addressed
is
going
to
be
the
first
to
act.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
i
am
talking
about
is
the
usual
routine
that
i
thought
was
implicit.
the
police
officer
arrests
and
then
this
escalates
into
a
physical
resistance
of
arrest,
a
struggle
perhaps
a
possibility
of
this
arrestee
seizing
the
pistol
or
trying
to
seize
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
they
didn’t
think
the
distinction
was
worth
treating.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
made
by
justice
white.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
not
implicit
in
the
totality
of
this
record
that
that’s
the
determination
of
the
highest
court
of
louisiana
has
made?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
reed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
garcia.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
possible
that
one
reason
why
the
city
council
enacted
a
special
ordinance
for
a
policeman
and
none
for
the
mayor
is
that
the
police
were
out
on
the
street
exposed
to
this
and
the
mayor
is
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
same
reason,
they
let
the
police
carry
guns
but
the
mayor
probably
does
not.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
language
that
justice
stewart
has
drawn
into
your
attention
and
i
took
it
as
the
hyperbole
of
that
the
extravagant
statement
that
sometimes
comes
in
dissenting
opinions,
which
the
majority
doesn’t
take
the
trouble
to
notice.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
if
you
have
anything
further,
you
have
one
minute
left
mr.
reed.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
very
much
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
justice
brennan
will
announce
the
disposition
of
72-6156,
lewis

new
