mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
today,
i
represent
the
city
of
new
orleans
and
the
matter
present
before
this
honorable
court.
i
believe
that
the
main
question
before
this
court
today
simply
stated
is
whether
or
not
section
49-7
of
the
new
orleans
code
is
unconstitutionally
vague
and
overbroad
in
violation
to
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
it
is
a
contention
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
that
the
ordinance
is
written
clearly
delineates
the
contours
of
its
proscription
and
obviously
does
not
apply
to
speech
that
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment
but
rather
applies
only
to
that
speech
which
find
to
self
within
the
exceptions
to
the
first
amendment.
as
early
as
in
1940
in
the
case
of
--
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
the
exception
for
fighting
words
and
the
exception
for
words
that’s
put
forth
in
chaplinsky.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
chaplinsky,
it
states
the
way
i
read
it
–
i
am
trying
to
get
an
exact
cite
on
it.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
that’s
correct,
the
lewd,
included
in
this
category
of
the
lewd
and
obscene,
the
profane,
the
libelous
and
the
insulting
or
fighting
words.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
that’s
the
interpretation
that
was
given
to
--
that
i
give
to
chaplinsky.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
in
the
gooding
case,
i
think—
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
that
is
a
correct
wording,
your
honor.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
that’s
not
the
contention
of
the
city
of
new
orleans.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
as
i
stated
in
the
case
of
cantwell
and
chaplinsky,
the
words
that
were
uttered
by
the
majority
opinion
of
this
court.
in
that
case,
chaplinsky,
the
court
concerned
itself
with
appellations
directed
to
a
police
officer
as
such
as
the
case
before
this
court
today.
in
chaplinsky,
the
defendant
told
a
marshal,
“you
are
a
damn
racketeer
and
a
damn
fascist.”
in
the
case
at
board,
the
words
used
by
mrs.
lewis,
i
think
the
court
will
agree
of
a
much
harsher
tone
in
input.
the
likelihood
of
the
utterance
failing
to
incite
the
average
person
to
a
breach
of
the
peace
is
highly
improbable
in
the
mallie
lewis
case.
they
are
going
to
your
interpretation
for
us
requiring
a
disturbance
or
inciting
of
the
peace.
we
feel
that
in
the
mallie
lewis
case,
the
use
of
the
words
g.d.m.f.
police
certainly
are
adequate
to
incite
a
member
of
the
new
orleans
police
department
or
to
incite
him
to
a
disturbance
of
the
peace.
although,
we
feel
that
the
appellant’s
contention
is
correct
that
he
should
not
permit
himself
to
--
he
should
exercise
as
much
restrain
upon
his
emotions
so
that
he
does
not
commit
himself
to
go
to
this
extent
to
incite
a
breach
of
the
peace.
we
don’t
feel
that
a
police
officer
should
be
penalized
simply
because
of
his
position
as
a
police
officer.
we
feel
that
he
should
be
judged
as
an
average
man
--
as
an
average
reasonable
man
just
as
anyone
who
is
a
layman
and
not
a
police
officer
should
be
judged.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
i
think
there
was
a
specific
purpose
in
the
minds
of
the
city
council
when
they
--
i
can’t
tell
you
exactly
what
it
is
but
it’s
my
interpretation
that
this
particular
ordinance
applies
to
situations
where
police
officers
are
cursed
with
profanities
by
members
of
the
populations.
it
is
a
specific
narrow
instance
of
when
the
revolving
statute
applies
to
police
officers.
please
the
mayor?
i
am
sorry?
can
you
do
what?
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
well,
that
depends
on
the--
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
the
use
of
obscene
words,
the
prohibition
against
the
use
of
obscene
words.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
not
that
i
know,
no
sir.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
does
overbreadth
apply
to
detectives?
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
that’s
correct,
as
long
as
he
is
a
member
of
the
new
orleans
police
department.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
if
they
would
direct
the
language
to
both
individuals?
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
if
they
were
to
direct
the
language
to
both
individuals.
the
language
directed
to
the
mayor
could
be
prosecuted
under
separate
ordinance,
not
the
reviling
ordinance
as
brought
forth
before
this
court
here.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
i
think
there’s
a
need
for
it.
it
is
a
contention
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
that
and
it
has
been
my
experience
as
an
assistant
city
attorney
that
this
goes
on
quite
often
that
citizens
apparently
for
what
reason,
i
don’t
know.
i
feel
that
it
is
permissible
or
they
can
get
away
with
reviling
in
new
orleans
police
officers
and
i
am
sure
officers
of
many
other
cities
around
the
united
states.
i
think
this
presents
distinct
problems
--
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
approximately
50%
of
our
case
is
in
a
municipal
court
concern
himself
with
reviling
a
police
where
a
police
officer
confronts
--
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
i
am
approximating
and
i
don’t
stand
on
the
accuracy
of
that
figure
but
this
is
--
i
think
it
would
be
close.
this
is
in
the
average
confrontation
where
a
police
officer
stops
not
--
maybe
not
an
upright
citizen
but
an
individual
who
is
suspected
of
committing
a
crime
on
the
streets
of
new
orleans.
the
attitude
of
the
citizenry
of
new
orleans
has
changed
to
the
effect
that
they
apparently
have
been
responding
with
these
type
of
abusive
words
to
the
new
orleans
policemen.
it’s
been
brought
forth
by
many
members
in
new
orleans
police
department
where
i
know
--
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
what?
i
am
misunderstanding
your
question.
what
new
business,
this
apparently
--
this
ordinance
is
initially
was
written
apparently
for
that
very
purpose.
but
my
comment
is
that
it
has
become
an
exaggerated.
the
instances
have
exaggerated.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
i
think
if
that
argument
were
true
that
the
police
could
find
more
serious
violations
with
which
to
arrest
someone
if
they
really
wanted
to
inconvenience
them
or
rather
to
penalize
them
for
no
reason
whatsoever.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
well
i’m
saying,
if
that
were
their
purpose,
i
don’t
believe
that
that
is
their
purpose.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
i
--
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
in
a
lot
of
instances,
not
solely
reviling
the
police
violations
that
i’m
talking
about.
a
lot
of
instances
they
are
charged
with
multiple
violations
--
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
no,
i
wouldn’t
say.
well,
a
lot
of
times,
this
particular
ordinance
is
now
process
due
to
the
prosecution
of
a
more
serious
one.
for
instance,
if
an
arrest
is
effective
for
two
or
three
violations
and
one
of
them
we
feel
we
have
a
better
case
i
will
now
process
this
one.
i
am
guessing
with
the
majority
of
cases.
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
overriding
percentage
of
cases
that
come
before
the
city
court
in
new
orleans
given
each
ordinance
a
percentage
of
the
reviling
of
the
police
ordinance
has
a
much
greater
percentage
than
that
of
any
other
ordinance.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
it
does,
yes
sir.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
the
volume
of
cases
per
day?
i
would
have
to
say
anywhere
from
30
to
35
per
day
for
section
(b).
we
have
four
sections.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
of
course,
i
am
not
--
i
would
have
to
say
that
approximately
15%
to
20%
of
them
at
least
and
up
to
50%
on
some
days.
i
am
approximating
on
the
figures
but
the
majority
of
them
as
opposed
to
other
classifications
of
crimes
or
for
reviling
the
police.
and
i
don’t
know
whether
this
court
is
having
difficulty
determining
what
the
reason
is
for
this.
but
it’s
been
my
experience
that
in
an
average
confrontation
between
citizens
of
new
orleans
and
the
new
orleans
police
department,
being
a
prosecutor
for
four
years
has
almost
always
resulted
in
the
use
of
obscene
language
by
its
citizens
to
the
members
of
the
--
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
it’s
that
hectic
between
the
new
orleans
police
and
the
citizens
on
the
streets,
yes
sir.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
absolutely.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
absolutely,
the
police
officers
of
course
are
on
the
street
daily
and
are
subjected
to
these
abuses
daily
as
i
stated.
the
mayor
of
course,
probably
rarely
if
ever
comes
into
contact
with
this
type
of
abuse.
and
if
so,
there
is
an
ordinance
that
would
protect
the
mayor
but
i
think
that
that’s
a
reason
for
this
specific
ordinance
relative
to
the
new
orleans
police
officers.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
well,
although
there
may
be
no
disagreement
with
that
construction
--
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
no,
i
don’t
believe
you
have.
but
what
i’m
saying
is
that
that
may
very
well
be
true
that
this
type
of
imaginative
situation
could
occur.
but
under
the
overbreadth
doctrine
which
was
quoted
in
the
index,
they
have
certain
guidelines
which
are
to
be
used
and
scrutinized
in
the
overbreadth
of
--
the
overbreadth
of
certain
ordinances.
and
the
first
one
of
this
is
the
degree
of
overbreadth
and
it
states
in
the
law
review
articles
specifically
a
law
on
not
to
be
struck
down
for
overbreadth
unless
it
lands
itself
to
a
substantial
number
of
impermissible
applications.
in
this
instance,
i
certainly
don’t
think
that
this
would
happen
at
all.
and
if
so,
it
certainly
wouldn’t
happen
in
a
substantial
number
of
instances.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
no
sir,
it’s
the
harvard
law
review.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
very
seldom.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
it’s
cited
in
the
doctrine
itself,
we
don’t
have
a
copy
of
but
it’s
cited
in
the
appendix.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
yes
sir,
i
have
read
it.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
i
have
a
copy
of
it.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
also
in
a
recent
case
which
was
decided
by
this
court
and
mr.
justice
marshall
stated
in
the
majority
opinion
that
condemned
to
the
use
of
words
it
can
never
expect
--
we
can
never
expect
mathematical
certainty
from
our
language
and
i
think
this
is
--
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
well
i
would
certainly
--
the
only
thing
i
can
say
about
the
louisiana
supreme
court’s
decision
is
what
i’ve
read
myself
is
substantially
the
same
thing
as
you
so
i
can’t
add
to
their
reasoning
in
that
decision.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
mr.
chief

and
may
it

iii
if
they
would
direct
the
language
to
both
individuals?
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
if
they
were
to
direct
the
language
to
both
individuals.
the
language
directed
to
the
mayor
could
be
prosecuted
under
separate
ordinance,
not
the
reviling
ordinance
as
brought
forth
before
this
court
here.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
i
think
there’s
a
need
for
it.
it
is
a
contention
of
the
city
of
new
orleans
that
and
it
has
been
my
experience
as
an
assistant
city
attorney
that
this
goes
on
quite
often
that
citizens
apparently
for
what
reason,
i
don’t
know.
i
feel
that
it
is
permissible
or
they
can
get
away
with
reviling
in
new
orleans
police
officers
and
i
am
sure
officers
of
many
other
cities
around
the
united
states.
i
think
this
presents
distinct
problems
--
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
approximately
50%
of
our
case
is
in
a
municipal
court
concern
himself
with
reviling
a
police
where
a
police
officer
confronts
--
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
i
am
approximating
and
i
don’t
stand
on
the
accuracy
of
that
figure
but
this
is
--
i
think
it
would
be
close.
this
is
in
the
average
confrontation
where
a
police
officer
stops
not
--
maybe
not
an
upright
citizen
but
an
individual
who
is
suspected
of
committing
a
crime
on
the
streets
of
new
orleans.
the
attitude
of
the
citizenry
of
new
orleans
has
changed
to
the
effect
that
they
apparently
have
been
responding
with
these
type
of
abusive
words
to
the
new
orleans
policemen.
it’s
been
brought
forth
by
many
members
in
new
orleans
police
department
where
i
know
--
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
what?
i
am
misunderstanding
your
question.
what
new
business,
this
apparently
--
this
ordinance
is
initially
was
written
apparently
for
that
very
purpose.
but
my
comment
is
that
it
has
become
an
exaggerated.
the
instances
have
exaggerated.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
i
think
if
that
argument
were
true
that
the
police
could
find
more
serious
violations
with
which
to
arrest
someone
if
they
really
wanted
to
inconvenience
them
or
rather
to
penalize
them
for
no
reason
whatsoever.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
well
i’m
saying,
if
that
were
their
purpose,
i
don’t
believe
that
that
is
their
purpose.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
i
--
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
in
a
lot
of
instances,
not
solely
reviling
the
police
violations
that
i’m
talking
about.
a
lot
of
instances
they
are
charged
with
multiple
violations
--
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
no,
i
wouldn’t
say.
well,
a
lot
of
times,
this
particular
ordinance
is
now
process
due
to
the
prosecution
of
a
more
serious
one.
for
instance,
if
an
arrest
is
effective
for
two
or
three
violations
and
one
of
them
we
feel
we
have
a
better
case
i
will
now
process
this
one.
i
am
guessing
with
the
majority
of
cases.
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
overriding
percentage
of
cases
that
come
before
the
city
court
in
new
orleans
given
each
ordinance
a
percentage
of
the
reviling
of
the
police
ordinance
has
a
much
greater
percentage
than
that
of
any
other
ordinance.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
it
does,
yes
sir.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
the
volume
of
cases
per
day?
i
would
have
to
say
anywhere
from
30
to
35
per
day
for
section
(b).
we
have
four
sections.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
of
course,
i
am
not
--
i
would
have
to
say
that
approximately
15%
to
20%
of
them
at
least
and
up
to
50%
on
some
days.
i
am
approximating
on
the
figures
but
the
majority
of
them
as
opposed
to
other
classifications
of
crimes
or
for
reviling
the
police.
and
i
don’t
know
whether
this
court
is
having
difficulty
determining
what
the
reason
is
for
this.
but
it’s
been
my
experience
that
in
an
average
confrontation
between
citizens
of
new
orleans
and
the
new
orleans
police
department,
being
a
prosecutor
for
four
years
has
almost
always
resulted
in
the
use
of
obscene
language
by
its
citizens
to
the
members
of
the
--
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
it’s
that
hectic
between
the
new
orleans
police
and
the
citizens
on
the
streets,
yes
sir.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
absolutely.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
absolutely,
the
police
officers
of
course
are
on
the
street
daily
and
are
subjected
to
these
abuses
daily
as
i
stated.
the
mayor
of
course,
probably
rarely
if
ever
comes
into
contact
with
this
type
of
abuse.
and
if
so,
there
is
an
ordinance
that
would
protect
the
mayor
but
i
think
that
that’s
a
reason
for
this
specific
ordinance
relative
to
the
new
orleans
police
officers.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
well,
although
there
may
be
no
disagreement
with
that
construction
--
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
no,
i
don’t
believe
you
have.
but
what
i’m
saying
is
that
that
may
very
well
be
true
that
this
type
of
imaginative
situation
could
occur.
but
under
the
overbreadth
doctrine
which
was
quoted
in
the
index,
they
have
certain
guidelines
which
are
to
be
used
and
scrutinized
in
the
overbreadth
of
--
the
overbreadth
of
certain
ordinances.
and
the
first
one
of
this
is
the
degree
of
overbreadth
and
it
states
in
the
law
review
articles
specifically
a
law
on
not
to
be
struck
down
for
overbreadth
unless
it
lands
itself
to
a
substantial
number
of
impermissible
applications.
in
this
instance,
i
certainly
don’t
think
that
this
would
happen
at
all.
and
if
so,
it
certainly
wouldn’t
happen
in
a
substantial
number
of
instances.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
no
sir,
it’s
the
harvard
law
review.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
very
seldom.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
it’s
cited
in
the
doctrine
itself,
we
don’t
have
a
copy
of
but
it’s
cited
in
the
appendix.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
yes
sir,
i
have
read
it.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
i
have
a
copy
of
it.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
also
in
a
recent
case
which
was
decided
by
this
court
and
mr.
justice
marshall
stated
in
the
majority
opinion
that
condemned
to
the
use
of
words
it
can
never
expect
--
we
can
never
expect
mathematical
certainty
from
our
language
and
i
think
this
is
--
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
servando
c.
garcia,
iii
well
i
would
certainly
--
the
only
thing
i
can
say
about
the
louisiana
supreme
court’s
decision
is
what
i’ve
read
myself
is
substantially
the
same
thing
as
you
so
i
can’t
add
to
their
reasoning
in
that
decision.
