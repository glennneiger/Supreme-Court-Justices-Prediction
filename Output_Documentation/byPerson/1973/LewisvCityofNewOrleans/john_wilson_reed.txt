mr.
john
wilson
reed
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
this
court
is
familiar
with
this
case
as
the
second
time
here.
we’d
like
to
emphasize
very
briefly
a
few
of
the
facts
though.
the
situation
is
--
typifies
a
sort
of
situation
that
probably
repeats
itself
everyday
in
the
urbanized
parts
of
our
society.
the
defendant,
mallie
lewis
was
upset
about
some
particular
police
conduct
directed
towards
her
son,
joseph.
she
failed
to
get
satisfactory
answers
from
the
police.
upon
the
advice
of
the
police,
she
followed
the
police
patrol
car
carrying
her
son
in
the
central
lockup
in
new
orleans.
now,
the
police
patrol
car
seeing
that
it
was
being
--
that
he
was
being
followed
eventually
pulled
over
the
appellant
apparently
to
find
out
why
she
was
following
him.
the
appellant
got
out
of
the
car,
protested
again
her
treatment
by
the
police
and
the
failure
to
explain
to
her
what
was
being
done
with
her
son.
and
at
that
point,
according
to
the
police
testimony
said,
“you
god
damn
m.
f.
police,
i
am
going
to
giarrusso
about
this.”
i
think
the
part,
“i
am
going
to
giarrusso
about
this,”
should
not
be
ignored.
giarrusso
is
the
superintendent
of
police
in
new
orleans,
a
high
public
official
and
a
comment
by
mallie
lewis
reflects
an
intention
to
complain
as
an
expression
of
some
first
amendment
interest.
the
ultimate
issue
in
the
case
is
one
of
the
limits
of
protest
and
expression
of
anger
by
a
citizen
who
feels
aggrieved
by
police
conduct.
statute
under
which
mallie
lewis
was
convicted
provides
that,
it
shall
be
unlawful
and
a
breach
of
the
peace
for
any
person
wantonly
to
curse
or
revile
or
to
use
obscene
or
opprobrious
language
toward
all
with
reference
to
any
member
of
the
city
police
while
in
the
actual
performance
of
his
duty.
when
this
case
was
last
before
the
court,
that
ordinance
had
never
been
the
subject
of
any
sort
of
construction
and
had
been
upheld
all
the
way
along
the
line
on
its
face.
it
had
never
in
fact
received
any
recent
consideration.
in
light
of
this
court’s
vacating
the
original
judgment
and
the
remand
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
has
once
again
affirmed
the
appellant’s
conviction
this
time
with
an
opinion.
the
position
of
the
appellant
that
the
opinion
below
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
is
not
a
narrowing
construction
of
the
ordinance,
that
it
does
not
resolve
the
constitutional
problems
and
that
it
leaves
punishable
language,
which
is
merely
opprobrious,
language
that
this
court
held
in
gooding
versus
wilson
cannot
be
punished.
i
think
the
point
that
most
clearly
emphasizes
this
is
the
provision
in
the
statute
that
the
language
need
not
only
be
spoken
towards
the
police
but
maybe
spoken
merely
with
reference
to
the
police.
this
issue
was
raised
right
from
the
very
beginning.
the
problem
with
in
reference
to
the
police,
the
problem
of
statements
made
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
particular
police
officer
spoken
about.
it’s
an
obvious
--
an
apparently
obvious
defect
in
an
ordinance
that
might
otherwise
be
made
applicable
to
fighting
words.
but
nowhere
does
the
opinion
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
below
address
that
issue
and
yet
it
was
very
clearly
before
the
court
the
dissent,
picked
it
up
at
great
length
below
but
the
majority
ignored
it.
and
i
submit
that
what
the
majority
did
below
was
justified
that
ordinance
on
its
face
which
cannot
be
done
under
this
court’s
holding
in
gooding.
now
admittedly,
the
court
below
does
refer
to
fighting
words
on
a
couple
of
occasions
in
its
opinions
but
it
never
articulates
what
the
fighting
words
standard
means.
whether
it
is
the
dictum
of
chaplinsky
that
fighting
words
of
those
which
are
likely
to
provoke
violence
or
the
mere
utterance
of
which
inflicts
injury
or
the
holding
of
chaplinsky
and
the
holding
of
gooding
that
the
only
language
punishable
is
that
which
is
likely
to
provoke
a
violent
response.
i
think
what
the
louisiana
supreme
court
did
below
is
similar
to
what
the
california
courts
had
done
with
the
ordinance
involved
in
cohen
versus
california.
and
in
that
case,
the
late
mr.
justice
harlan
noted
in
the
footnote
that
although
the
supreme
court
of
california
had
limited
the
scope
of
the
ordinance
to
utterances
likely
to
result
in
violence.
it
had
more
or
less
made
a
per
se
holding
that
all
obscene
language
or
epithets
of
the
type
uttered
by
cohen
were
in
all
cases
likely
to
provoke
violence.
and
that’s
basically
the
way
the
louisiana
supreme
court
below
has
afforded
this
court’s
holding
in
gooding
by
simply
deciding,
okay,
all
opprobrious
and
obscene
language
is
fighting
words
and
that
is
the
end
of
it.
but
i
think
that
circumvents
this
court’s
holding
completely.
i
think
an
ordinance
like
this
because
of
the
manner
in
which
it
is
enforced
and
the
courts
in
which
it
is
enforced
presents
a
good
case
for
the
application
of
the
“overbreadth”
doctrine.
the
ordinance
has
been
on
the
books
in
louisiana
and
enforced
in
new
orleans
for
77
years
but
until
this
past
couple
of
years
has
not
been
the
subject
of
any
appellate
decisions
whatsoever.
it
is
not
the
sort
of
ordinance
that
is
going
to
effectively
narrowed
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
the
whole
ordinance
is
overbroad,
it
must
be
thrown
out
and
standard
set
for
how
to
write
a
good
ordinance,
how
the
legislative
authorities
in
new
orleans
can
address
themselves
to
the
problems.
there
is
implicit
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
below
that
an
ordinance
such
as
this
can
be
justified
as
opposed
to
the
ordinance
involved
in
gooding
because
of
the
limitation
of
the
ordinance
to
language
spoken
of
the
police.
i
think
the
interest
involved
tend
to
cut
the
other
way
and
of
anything
the
fact
that
this
ordinance
is
limited
to
language
spoken
of
the
police
suggests
that
the
standard
should
be
even
tighter
and
more
rigorous
and
that
this
court
should
assure
that
the
fighting
word
standard
is
not
abused
in
this
context.
i
think
it
is
necessary
to
go
back
to
the
facts
again
because
i
don’t
think
it
is
clear
at
all
that
what
mallie
lewis
uttered
were
in
fact
fighting
words.
it
was
an
expression
of
anger.
someone
might
pound
their
fist
in
anger
or
pull
a
hair
in
anger
or
simply
if
they
were
a
person
of
great
self-control
say,
“i
am
angry.”
the
comment
was
directed
at
all
police
generally,
not
just
the
police
officer
there.
tied
in
with
it
was
a
statement
that
i
am
aggrieved,
i
am
going
to
complain.
i
do
not
think
police
officer
berner
could
legitimately
feel
that
the
language
addressed
to
him
by
mallie
lewis
was
intended
to
provoke
him.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
officer
berner
was
provoked.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
it’s
not
completely
clear
to
me
that
it
was
a
heated
exchange
and
secondly,
i
was
saying
the
context
of
a
citizen
to
a
police
officer,
i
do
expect
that
sort
of
consideration.
a
police
officer
is
--
the
court
i
know
is
familiar
with
it,
the
comments
on
the
model
penal
code
is
accustomed
to
language
of
this
sort.
the
citizen
is
not
and
the
police
officer
deals
day
to
day
with
situations
in
which
people
feel
hostile
towards
it.
both
the
innocent
and
the
guilty
being
arrested
or
being
accosted
or
investigated
by
the
police
are
going
to
feel
aggrieved.
the
innocent
wants
to
know
why
it
is
happening
to
them
and
the
guilty
realizes
that
the
game
is
up
and
the
people
who
the
police
are
dealing
with,
in
most
circumstances
feels
some
anger
towards
the
police.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
i
think
if
it’s
an
impulsive
expression
of
anger,
yes.
i
think
if
it’s
fair
for
the
police
officer
not
to
consider
it
as
a
provocation,
i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
i’d
like
distinguish
certain
kinds
of
words.
let’s
say
a
defendant
or
a
citizen
says,
“you
god
damn
m.
f.
police,
take
off
your
gun
and
i’ll
show
you,
who’s
the
boss.”
well,
that’s
a
challenge
to
the
police
officer
right
there.
it’s
a
challenge
to
his
authority.
it’s
a
dare
“i
dare
you
to
do
something.”
the
words
uttered
by
mallie
lewis
here
aren’t
that
kind
of
language.
i
mean,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
cohen,
you
know
that
the
words
uttered
by
the
defendant
there
were
somewhat
childish.
they
were.
they
were
premeditated
that
that
was
the
way
he
wanted
to
express
himself.
he
had
time
to
think
it
out
in
advance.
mallie
lewis
was
acting
in
a
stressful
situation.
she
was
expressing
anger
and
the
only
way
it
appeared
to
her
to
express
anger,
not
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
yes,
and
i’ll
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
well,
i’d
like
to
consider
chaplinsky
that’s
right
along
that
line.
we
do
not
dispute
the
law
--
the
legal
rule
that
was
announced
in
chaplinsky
that
fighting
words
are
not
protected
speech.
the
question
is
what
are
the
fighting
words?
i
think
the
application
of
that
standard
to
the
utterances
expressed
in
chaplinsky
is
no
longer
free
from
doubt.
this
court
said
there
that
argument
is
unnecessary
that
god
damned
fascist
and
racketeer,
are
fighting
words.
i
think
the
argument
today
might
very
well
be
necessary
on
that
point.
in
gooding,
this
court
said,
“god
damn
you,
get
out
of
the
road,”
while
clearly
expressing
disgrace
were
not
fighting
words.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
right,
but
as
i
understand
the
court’s
opinion,
it
was
used
as
an
example
of
the
fact
that
the
georgia
courts
had
been
applying
the
ordinance
there
to
situations
that
did
not
involve
fighting
words
and
at
that
case
was
cited
as
an
example
in
which
a
jury
issue
was
raised
by
that
utterance.
and
this
court
was
of
the
opinion
that
no
jury
issue
was
raised
because
those
were
--
while
words
were
opprobrium
were
not
clearly
fighting
words.
and,
you
know,
i
would
think
the
average
person
today
might
feel
that
he
was
less
likely
to
provoke
a
violent
response
if
he
said
to
a
trained
police
officer
in
a
metropolitan
environment,
“you
are
a
god
damn
racketeer.”
and
if
he
said
to
a
stranger
down
a
country
road,
“god
damn
you,
get
out
of
the
road.”
i
am
personally
would
think
i
would
be
more
likely
to
be
--
get
a
violent
response
from
the
stranger
on
the
country
road.
so
i
think
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
i
didn’t
fully
understand
that.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
everybody
else
do.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
all
i
can
say
about
that
sentence
your
honor
is
that
it
is
contradicted
by
other
parts
of
the
opinion.
it’s
contradicted
by
saying
wantonly
cursing
or
reviling
or
using
obscene
or
opprobrious
words
are
not
a
protected
means
of
communication,
the
appendix
of
56.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
i
think
it
is
very
clear
that
the
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
the
prohibitions
of
section
49-7
are
self-explanatory.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
right.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
56
to
57,
the
proscriptions
are
narrow
and
specific,
wantonly
cursing
reviling
or
using
obscene
or
opprobrious
language
but
this
court
has
held
the
mere
use
of
an
obscenity
is
not
fighting
words.
the
mere
use
of
an
opprobrious
language
is
not
fighting
words.
now,
the
court
below
does
look
at
chaplinsky
but
what’s
significant
in
the
court’s
reading
of
chaplinsky
is
nowhere
does
the
louisiana
supreme
court
recognized
that
chaplinsky’s
conviction
was
upheld
because
new
hampshire
had
narrowed
the
ordinance.
louisiana
supreme
court
below
refers
to
chaplinsky’s
conviction,
refers
to
the
ordinance
and
then
says
chaplinsky’s
conviction
was
okay
and
it
is
okay
here.
never
does
the
louisiana
supreme
court
start
to
think
about
the
construction
issue.
and
i
think
the
opinions,
the
justification
of
the
ordinance
on
its
face.
now,
i
suppose
it
would
be
possible
to
lift
out
of
there
a
section
of
the
opinion
and
say,
this
is
what
the
supreme
court
meant
and
perhaps
tell
them
what
they
meant.
but
i
don’t
think
it’is
clear
just
reading
the
opinion
as
it
stands
now
that
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
the
words
used
here
to
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--
on
a
citizen
to
citizen
encounter
under
properly
narrowed
ordinance
might
very
well
be
considered
fighting
words.
not
necessarily
but
they
might
be.
i
think
it
would
be
jury
issue
or
a
judge
issue
in
the
case
as
this
case
in
louisiana
but
i
think
it
would
raise
a
question.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
that’s
the
concept
expressed
basically
in
your
case
isn’t
it?yes.
but
in
that
process,
do
you
think
you
have
to
take
into
account
that
the
policeman
is
a
man
who,
certainly
in
new
orleans.
just
bring
a
pistol
right
on
his
belt
with
probably
no
jacket
over,
a
good
deal
at
the
time
of
the
year
and
if
they
do
get
into
a
fight
of
it.
if
not
withstanding
our
parsing
of
how
innocent
these
words
are,
they
do
in
fact
get
into
a
fight,
which
allow
them
to
have
a
rather
serious
if
not
a
fatal
fight
because
of
the
presence
of
firearms?
mr.
john
wilson
reed
now,
if
after
these
words
are
uttered,
the
police
officer
says
something
and
the
situation
escalates
the
sooner
or
later
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
well
that
possibility
exists
whenever
any
arrest
is
made
that
the
person
will
protest
in
fact
of
anything
it
suggest
why
language
like
this
if
the
court
agrees
that
it
is
inherently
harmless,
it
is
all
the
more
reason
why
somebody
should
not
be
arrested.
and
your
honor’s
comment
that
you
know
what
usually
happens
would
be
that
the
person
would
be
arrested
upon
uttering
something
like
that.
i
do
not
think
that
is
entirely
clear.
i
think
there
is
inherent
in
an
ordinance
such
as
this.
a
possibility
for
abuse
by
the
police
in
its
enforcement
similar
to
the
sort
of
abuse
that
was
possible
under
the
vagrancy
ordinance
is
criticized
in
papachristou.
if
the
police
are
called
to
a
citizen
to
citizen
encounter
or
that
the
language
used
is
reported
to
them,
they
will
make
some
judgment
whether
they
think
this
has
escalated
to
the
point
where
criminal
sanctions
are
required.
or
they
may
simply
accommodate
the
interest
by
saying,
“well,
he
did
go
a
little
loud
but
just
stay
away
from
him.”
in
the
police–citizen
encounter,
this
gives
the
police
officer
tremendous
amount
of
discretion
to
make
arrest
where
no
other
ground
for
arrest
exists.
this
goes
--
this
argument
goes
somewhat
beyond
the
record
but
you
don’t
find
armed
robbers,
murderers,
burglars
being
charged
with
those
serious
felonies
and
reviling
a
police.
you
find
it
in
the
situation
of
someone
like
mallie
lewis
who
did
nothing
else
wrong.
the
situation
of
yvonne
martin
and
that
record
was
before
the
court
too
in
a
related
case.
no
other
crimes
charged.
for
example,
let
us
take
a
situation
where
the
police
deal
repeatedly
once
a
month
with
a
known
criminal
on
the
street.
one
day,
they
come
down
and
they
say,
“okay,
up
against
the
wall.”
and
he
is
going
to
stock
you
and
frisk
you
and
the
guy
says,
“you
m.
s.,
why
are
you
always
bothering
me?
man,
why
don’t
you
go
by
to
somebody
else?
i
haven’t
done
anything
wrong.”
the
police
frisk
him,
they
find
nothing,
right
then,
they
have
there
in
a
position
where
they
can
put
this
guy
away.
they
can
bother
him,
send
him
through
the
trouble
of
making
bond
when
they
are
really
not
offended
by
that
language,
expect
that
language
in
that
type
of
situation
and
may
very
well
be
using
this
language
themselves
on
occasion?
a
lawyer
might
use
it
to
his
partner
quietly
in
a
courtroom
when
taken
by
surprise
by
a
witness
he’s
called.
i
don’t
think
the
police
in
that
context
would
be
offended
by
that
language
but
the
existence
of
a
statute
like
this
gives
the
possibility
for
the
abuse
of
that
statute
by
the
police.
i
think
there
is
a
more
significant
first
amendment
interest
in
allowing
citizens
to
criticize
the
police
and
there
is
no
law
allowing
citizens
to
criticize
citizens.
in
the
libel
decisions
of
this
court
reflect
that
in
time
versus
pate,
st.
amant
versus
thompson,
this
court
has
held
the
police
to
be
public
officials
unless
entitled
to
somewhat
less
protection
than
a
purely
private
citizen
from
possibly
libelous
statements
by
the
press,
by
people
running
for
political
office.
and
i
think
that
all
of
the
decisions
in
the
past
show
that
public
officials
can
be
criticized
more
harshly
and
that
there
is
an
interest
in
permitting
that
sort
of
criticism.
to
the
extent
that
there
might
be
a
rational
for
allowing
a
broader
proscription
of
speech
when
that
speech
is
addressed
to
the
police
that
rational
is
not
addressed
by
the
ordinance
here.
the
question
of
interference
is
a
very
good
--
would
make
a
very
good
rationale
but
interference
is
not
the
object
of
the
statute.
and
colten
v.
kentucky
involved
an
interference
the
statute
was
addressed
to
that
sort
of
convict.
it
did
not
even
involve
any
obscene
or
opprobrious
language.
this
ordinance
--
an
ordinance
of
this
type
might
be
upheld
if
it
were
addressed
to
interferences
but
it
is
not.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
yes,
but
the
limitation
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
i
don’t
think
they
have
decided
that.
i
don’t
think
they
really
attack
the
question.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
that’s
possible.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
but
if
they
are
certainly
not
entitled
to
more
protection
unless
it
is
an
interference
type
rational.
but
the
statute
--
there’s
no
construction
of
the
statute
and
the
statute
or
its
face
is
not
directed
to
the
question
of
interference.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
i
think
the
constitution
requires
that
the
state
court
or
the
legislature
enacting
a
law
like
this
require
a
focus
on
all
the
attendant
circumstances
surrounding
the
utterance
and
that
they
cannot
adopt
a
per
se
rule
that
the
utterance
here
is
in
all
circumstances
fighting
words.
it
should
be
noted
that
the
court
below
did
not
have
the
record
before
it.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
yes,
i
think
the
first
amendment
would
prevent
that
because
the
first
amendment
prevents
the
proscription
of
free
speech
unless
you
can
point
to
an
identifiable
danger
from
that
speech.
and
the
legislature
simply
can’t
make
up
identifiable
dangers
that
do
not
exist.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
if
he
decided
that
they
were
likely
to
provoke
under
the
circumstances
uttered
they
were
likely
to
provoke
the
average
police
officer
to
violence,
yes.
if
that
were
the
findings,
i
think
that
is
what
the
finding
has
to
be,
not
the
average
citizen
but
the
average
police
officer.
the
ordinance
limits
itself
to
the
police.
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
the
standards
should
be
those
of
the
police.
because
i
don’t
think
--
i
think
that’s
required
because
the
police
are
not
as
sensitive
to
language
such
as
this
as
of
a
60-year-old
woman
would
be
or
even
the
average
citizen
might
be.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
no,
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor.
the
court
below
did
not
have
a
record
before
it.
and
therefore,
i
don’t
think
if
they
made
a
narrowing
construction,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
have
to
look
at
the
record
to
see
whether
the
appellant’s
speech
fit
it
in
into
that
narrowing
construction.
and
it
is
quite
clear
that
at
the
time
this
case
was
originally
remanded
from
this
court,
there
was
an
absolute
necessity
to
construe
that
statute,
to
limit
that
statute
at
some
way.
on
its
face,
it’s
remarkably
similar
not
nearly
as
good
even
as
the
statute
involved
in
gooding
versus
wilson.
so,
since
they
did
not
have
the
record
before
them,
i
don’t
see
how
they
can
possibly
have
made
any
finding
along
that
line.
all
they
had
before
them
was
mr.
justice
powell’s
comment
in
the
concurrence
of
the
remand
order
of
june
1972.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
the
answer
to
that
is
i
--
is
that
the
application
for
writs
was
made
to
louisiana
supreme
court.
it
does
not
require
that
the
record
be
sent
up.
if
the
application
for
writs
is
granted,
the
record
is
sent
up.
when
the
case
came
back
down
on
remand,
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
did
not
read
this
is
as
forcing
them
to
grant
writs
on
the
case
order
up
the
record
from
the
criminal
district
court
and
consider
the
whole
thing.
that
is
the
only
possible
explanation.
the
yvonne
martin
case
that
was
also
remanded
was
argued
twice
in
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
the
first
time
without
the
record
and
then
they
did
subsequently
order
up
the
record
in
that
case.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
that’s
right
and
the
judgment
is
correct
was
of
that
of
the
criminal
district
court
of
appeals
which
upheld
the
ordinance
very
clearly
on
its
face.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
because
i
complied
with
the
rule
of
this
court
at
that
time
which
was
either
had
just
been
changed
or
was
being
changed
that
required
that
the
record
be
sent
up.
and
that’s
simply
the
reason
why
it
was
here
and
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
no,
it
did
not
go
back
to
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
it
maybe
still
here,
i
don’t
know.
it
was
my
own
copy,
the
copy
that
i
have
prepared
that
i
think
that
i
sent
up.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
the
trial
transcript
was
not
before
the
court.
footnote
one
to
the
majority’s
opinions
says,
“while
we
do
not
have
the
record
here
before
us,
we
note
from
mr.
justice
powell’s
concurrence
that
here,
the
appellant
uttered
the
words,
“god
damn
m.
f.
police.”
mr.
john
wilson
reed
that
was
not
before
the
court.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
the
only
they
have
was
my
original
application
for
writs
back
in
1970
or
1971
which
i
discussed
the
case,
the
legal
issues
but
was
no
transfer
of
that
application
for
writs.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
am
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
thank
you.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
unless
the
court
has
any
questions
your
honor,
i
have
nothing
further
to
say.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
this
court
is
familiar
with
this
case
as
the
second
time
here.
we’d
like
to
emphasize
very
briefly
a
few
of
the
facts
though.
the
situation
is
--
typifies
a
sort
of
situation
that
probably
repeats
itself
everyday
in
the
urbanized
parts
of
our
society.
the
defendant,
mallie
lewis
was
upset
about
some
particular
police
conduct
directed
towards
her
son,
joseph.
she
failed
to
get
satisfactory
answers
from
the
police.
upon
the
advice
of
the
police,
she
followed
the
police
patrol
car
carrying
her
son
in
the
central
lockup
in
new
orleans.
now,
the
police
patrol
car
seeing
that
it
was
being
--
that
he
was
being
followed
eventually
pulled
over
the
appellant
apparently
to
find
out
why
she
was
following
him.
the
appellant
got
out
of
the
car,
protested
again
her
treatment
by
the
police
and
the
failure
to
explain
to
her
what
was
being
done
with
her
son.
and
at
that
point,
according
to
the
police
testimony
said,
“you
god
damn
m.
f.
police,
i
am
going
to
giarrusso
about
this.”
i
think
the
part,
“i
am
going
to
giarrusso
about
this,”
should
not
be
ignored.
giarrusso
is
the
superintendent
of
police
in
new
orleans,
a
high
public
official
and
a
comment
by
mallie
lewis
reflects
an
intention
to
complain
as
an
expression
of
some
first
amendment
interest.
the
ultimate
issue
in
the
case
is
one
of
the
limits
of
protest
and
expression
of
anger
by
a
citizen
who
feels
aggrieved
by
police
conduct.
statute
under
which
mallie
lewis
was
convicted
provides
that,
it
shall
be
unlawful
and
a
breach
of
the
peace
for
any
person
wantonly
to
curse
or
revile
or
to
use
obscene
or
opprobrious
language
toward
all
with
reference
to
any
member
of
the
city
police
while
in
the
actual
performance
of
his
duty.
when
this
case
was
last
before
the
court,
that
ordinance
had
never
been
the
subject
of
any
sort
of
construction
and
had
been
upheld
all
the
way
along
the
line
on
its
face.
it
had
never
in
fact
received
any
recent
consideration.
in
light
of
this
court’s
vacating
the
original
judgment
and
the
remand
of
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
has
once
again
affirmed
the
appellant’s
conviction
this
time
with
an
opinion.
the
position
of
the
appellant
that
the
opinion
below
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
is
not
a
narrowing
construction
of
the
ordinance,
that
it
does
not
resolve
the
constitutional
problems
and
that
it
leaves
punishable
language,
which
is
merely
opprobrious,
language
that
this
court
held
in
gooding
versus
wilson
cannot
be
punished.
i
think
the
point
that
most
clearly
emphasizes
this
is
the
provision
in
the
statute
that
the
language
need
not
only
be
spoken
towards
the
police
but
maybe
spoken
merely
with
reference
to
the
police.
this
issue
was
raised
right
from
the
very
beginning.
the
problem
with
in
reference
to
the
police,
the
problem
of
statements
made
out
of
the
hearing
of
the
particular
police
officer
spoken
about.
it’s
an
obvious
--
an
apparently
obvious
defect
in
an
ordinance
that
might
otherwise
be
made
applicable
to
fighting
words.
but
nowhere
does
the
opinion
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court
below
address
that
issue
and
yet
it
was
very
clearly
before
the
court
the
dissent,
picked
it
up
at
great
length
below
but
the
majority
ignored
it.
and
i
submit
that
what
the
majority
did
below
was
justified
that
ordinance
on
its
face
which
cannot
be
done
under
this
court’s
holding
in
gooding.
now
admittedly,
the
court
below
does
refer
to
fighting
words
on
a
couple
of
occasions
in
its
opinions
but
it
never
articulates
what
the
fighting
words
standard
means.
whether
it
is
the
dictum
of
chaplinsky
that
fighting
words
of
those
which
are
likely
to
provoke
violence
or
the
mere
utterance
of
which
inflicts
injury
or
the
holding
of
chaplinsky
and
the
holding
of
gooding
that
the
only
language
punishable
is
that
which
is
likely
to
provoke
a
violent
response.
i
think
what
the
louisiana
supreme
court
did
below
is
similar
to
what
the
california
courts
had
done
with
the
ordinance
involved
in
cohen
versus
california.
and
in
that
case,
the
late
mr.
justice
harlan
noted
in
the
footnote
that
although
the
supreme
court
of
california
had
limited
the
scope
of
the
ordinance
to
utterances
likely
to
result
in
violence.
it
had
more
or
less
made
a
per
se
holding
that
all
obscene
language
or
epithets
of
the
type
uttered
by
cohen
were
in
all
cases
likely
to
provoke
violence.
and
that’s
basically
the
way
the
louisiana
supreme
court
below
has
afforded
this
court’s
holding
in
gooding
by
simply
deciding,
okay,
all
opprobrious
and
obscene
language
is
fighting
words
and
that
is
the
end
of
it.
but
i
think
that
circumvents
this
court’s
holding
completely.
i
think
an
ordinance
like
this
because
of
the
manner
in
which
it
is
enforced
and
the
courts
in
which
it
is
enforced
presents
a
good
case
for
the
application
of
the
“overbreadth”
doctrine.
the
ordinance
has
been
on
the
books
in
louisiana
and
enforced
in
new
orleans
for
77
years
but
until
this
past
couple
of
years
has
not
been
the
subject
of
any
appellate
decisions
whatsoever.
it
is
not
the
sort
of
ordinance
that
is
going
to
effectively
narrowed
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
the
whole
ordinance
is
overbroad,
it
must
be
thrown
out
and
standard
set
for
how
to
write
a
good
ordinance,
how
the
legislative
authorities
in
new
orleans
can
address
themselves
to
the
problems.
there
is
implicit
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
below
that
an
ordinance
such
as
this
can
be
justified
as
opposed
to
the
ordinance
involved
in
gooding
because
of
the
limitation
of
the
ordinance
to
language
spoken
of
the
police.
i
think
the
interest
involved
tend
to
cut
the
other
way
and
of
anything
the
fact
that
this
ordinance
is
limited
to
language
spoken
of
the
police
suggests
that
the
standard
should
be
even
tighter
and
more
rigorous
and
that
this
court
should
assure
that
the
fighting
word
standard
is
not
abused
in
this
context.
i
think
it
is
necessary
to
go
back
to
the
facts
again
because
i
don’t
think
it
is
clear
at
all
that
what
mallie
lewis
uttered
were
in
fact
fighting
words.
it
was
an
expression
of
anger.
someone
might
pound
their
fist
in
anger
or
pull
a
hair
in
anger
or
simply
if
they
were
a
person
of
great
self-control
say,
“i
am
angry.”
the
comment
was
directed
at
all
police
generally,
not
just
the
police
officer
there.
tied
in
with
it
was
a
statement
that
i
am
aggrieved,
i
am
going
to
complain.
i
do
not
think
police
officer
berner
could
legitimately
feel
that
the
language
addressed
to
him
by
mallie
lewis
was
intended
to
provoke
him.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
officer
berner
was
provoked.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
it’s
not
completely
clear
to
me
that
it
was
a
heated
exchange
and
secondly,
i
was
saying
the
context
of
a
citizen
to
a
police
officer,
i
do
expect
that
sort
of
consideration.
a
police
officer
is
--
the
court
i
know
is
familiar
with
it,
the
comments
on
the
model
penal
code
is
accustomed
to
language
of
this
sort.
the
citizen
is
not
and
the
police
officer
deals
day
to
day
with
situations
in
which
people
feel
hostile
towards
it.
both
the
innocent
and
the
guilty
being
arrested
or
being
accosted
or
investigated
by
the
police
are
going
to
feel
aggrieved.
the
innocent
wants
to
know
why
it
is
happening
to
them
and
the
guilty
realizes
that
the
game
is
up
and
the
people
who
the
police
are
dealing
with,
in
most
circumstances
feels
some
anger
towards
the
police.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
i
think
if
it’s
an
impulsive
expression
of
anger,
yes.
i
think
if
it’s
fair
for
the
police
officer
not
to
consider
it
as
a
provocation,
i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
i’d
like
distinguish
certain
kinds
of
words.
let’s
say
a
defendant
or
a
citizen
says,
“you
god
damn
m.
f.
police,
take
off
your
gun
and
i’ll
show
you,
who’s
the
boss.”
well,
that’s
a
challenge
to
the
police
officer
right
there.
it’s
a
challenge
to
his
authority.
it’s
a
dare
“i
dare
you
to
do
something.”
the
words
uttered
by
mallie
lewis
here
aren’t
that
kind
of
language.
i
mean,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
cohen,
you
know
that
the
words
uttered
by
the
defendant
there
were
somewhat
childish.
they
were.
they
were
premeditated
that
that
was
the
way
he
wanted
to
express
himself.
he
had
time
to
think
it
out
in
advance.
mallie
lewis
was
acting
in
a
stressful
situation.
she
was
expressing
anger
and
the
only
way
it
appeared
to
her
to
express
anger,
not
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
yes,
and
i’ll
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
well,
i’d
like
to
consider
chaplinsky
that’s
right
along
that
line.
we
do
not
dispute
the
law
--
the
legal
rule
that
was
announced
in
chaplinsky
that
fighting
words
are
not
protected
speech.
the
question
is
what
are
the
fighting
words?
i
think
the
application
of
that
standard
to
the
utterances
expressed
in
chaplinsky
is
no
longer
free
from
doubt.
this
court
said
there
that
argument
is
unnecessary
that
god
damned
fascist
and
racketeer,
are
fighting
words.
i
think
the
argument
today
might
very
well
be
necessary
on
that
point.
in
gooding,
this
court
said,
“god
damn
you,
get
out
of
the
road,”
while
clearly
expressing
disgrace
were
not
fighting
words.
well,
i
think
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
right,
but
as
i
understand
the
court’s
opinion,
it
was
used
as
an
example
of
the
fact
that
the
georgia
courts
had
been
applying
the
ordinance
there
to
situations
that
did
not
involve
fighting
words
and
at
that
case
was
cited
as
an
example
in
which
a
jury
issue
was
raised
by
that
utterance.
and
this
court
was
of
the
opinion
that
no
jury
issue
was
raised
because
those
were
--
while
words
were
opprobrium
were
not
clearly
fighting
words.
and,
you
know,
i
would
think
the
average
person
today
might
feel
that
he
was
less
likely
to
provoke
a
violent
response
if
he
said
to
a
trained
police
officer
in
a
metropolitan
environment,
“you
are
a
god
damn
racketeer.”
and
if
he
said
to
a
stranger
down
a
country
road,
“god
damn
you,
get
out
of
the
road.”
i
am
personally
would
think
i
would
be
more
likely
to
be
--
get
a
violent
response
from
the
stranger
on
the
country
road.
so
i
think
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
i
didn’t
fully
understand
that.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
everybody
else
do.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
all
i
can
say
about
that
sentence
your
honor
is
that
it
is
contradicted
by
other
parts
of
the
opinion.
it’s
contradicted
by
saying
wantonly
cursing
or
reviling
or
using
obscene
or
opprobrious
words
are
not
a
protected
means
of
communication,
the
appendix
of
56.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
i
think
it
is
very
clear
that
the
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
the
prohibitions
of
section
49-7
are
self-explanatory.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
right.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
56
to
57,
the
proscriptions
are
narrow
and
specific,
wantonly
cursing
reviling
or
using
obscene
or
opprobrious
language
but
this
court
has
held
the
mere
use
of
an
obscenity
is
not
fighting
words.
the
mere
use
of
an
opprobrious
language
is
not
fighting
words.
now,
the
court
below
does
look
at
chaplinsky
but
what’s
significant
in
the
court’s
reading
of
chaplinsky
is
nowhere
does
the
louisiana
supreme
court
recognized
that
chaplinsky’s
conviction
was
upheld
because
new
hampshire
had
narrowed
the
ordinance.
louisiana
supreme
court
below
refers
to
chaplinsky’s
conviction,
refers
to
the
ordinance
and
then
says
chaplinsky’s
conviction
was
okay
and
it
is
okay
here.
never
does
the
louisiana
supreme
court
start
to
think
about
the
construction
issue.
and
i
think
the
opinions,
the
justification
of
the
ordinance
on
its
face.
now,
i
suppose
it
would
be
possible
to
lift
out
of
there
a
section
of
the
opinion
and
say,
this
is
what
the
supreme
court
meant
and
perhaps
tell
them
what
they
meant.
but
i
don’t
think
it’is
clear
just
reading
the
opinion
as
it
stands
now
that
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
the
words
used
here
to
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--
on
a
citizen
to
citizen
encounter
under
properly
narrowed
ordinance
might
very
well
be
considered
fighting
words.
not
necessarily
but
they
might
be.
i
think
it
would
be
jury
issue
or
a
judge
issue
in
the
case
as
this
case
in
louisiana
but
i
think
it
would
raise
a
question.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
that’s
the
concept
expressed
basically
in
your
case
isn’t
it?yes.
but
in
that
process,
do
you
think
you
have
to
take
into
account
that
the
policeman
is
a
man
who,
certainly
in
new
orleans.
just
bring
a
pistol
right
on
his
belt
with
probably
no
jacket
over,
a
good
deal
at
the
time
of
the
year
and
if
they
do
get
into
a
fight
of
it.
if
not
withstanding
our
parsing
of
how
innocent
these
words
are,
they
do
in
fact
get
into
a
fight,
which
allow
them
to
have
a
rather
serious
if
not
a
fatal
fight
because
of
the
presence
of
firearms?
mr.
john
wilson
reed
now,
if
after
these
words
are
uttered,
the
police
officer
says
something
and
the
situation
escalates
the
sooner
or
later
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
well
that
possibility
exists
whenever
any
arrest
is
made
that
the
person
will
protest
in
fact
of
anything
it
suggest
why
language
like
this
if
the
court
agrees
that
it
is
inherently
harmless,
it
is
all
the
more
reason
why
somebody
should
not
be
arrested.
and
your
honor’s
comment
that
you
know
what
usually
happens
would
be
that
the
person
would
be
arrested
upon
uttering
something
like
that.
i
do
not
think
that
is
entirely
clear.
i
think
there
is
inherent
in
an
ordinance
such
as
this.
a
possibility
for
abuse
by
the
police
in
its
enforcement
similar
to
the
sort
of
abuse
that
was
possible
under
the
vagrancy
ordinance
is
criticized
in
papachristou.
if
the
police
are
called
to
a
citizen
to
citizen
encounter
or
that
the
language
used
is
reported
to
them,
they
will
make
some
judgment
whether
they
think
this
has
escalated
to
the
point
where
criminal
sanctions
are
required.
or
they
may
simply
accommodate
the
interest
by
saying,
“well,
he
did
go
a
little
loud
but
just
stay
away
from
him.”
in
the
police–citizen
encounter,
this
gives
the
police
officer
tremendous
amount
of
discretion
to
make
arrest
where
no
other
ground
for
arrest
exists.
this
goes
--
this
argument
goes
somewhat
beyond
the
record
but
you
don’t
find
armed
robbers,
murderers,
burglars
being
charged
with
those
serious
felonies
and
reviling
a
police.
you
find
it
in
the
situation
of
someone
like
mallie
lewis
who
did
nothing
else
wrong.
the
situation
of
yvonne
martin
and
that
record
was
before
the
court
too
in
a
related
case.
no
other
crimes
charged.
for
example,
let
us
take
a
situation
where
the
police
deal
repeatedly
once
a
month
with
a
known
criminal
on
the
street.
one
day,
they
come
down
and
they
say,
“okay,
up
against
the
wall.”
and
he
is
going
to
stock
you
and
frisk
you
and
the
guy
says,
“you
m.
s.,
why
are
you
always
bothering
me?
man,
why
don’t
you
go
by
to
somebody
else?
i
haven’t
done
anything
wrong.”
the
police
frisk
him,
they
find
nothing,
right
then,
they
have
there
in
a
position
where
they
can
put
this
guy
away.
they
can
bother
him,
send
him
through
the
trouble
of
making
bond
when
they
are
really
not
offended
by
that
language,
expect
that
language
in
that
type
of
situation
and
may
very
well
be
using
this
language
themselves
on
occasion?
a
lawyer
might
use
it
to
his
partner
quietly
in
a
courtroom
when
taken
by
surprise
by
a
witness
he’s
called.
i
don’t
think
the
police
in
that
context
would
be
offended
by
that
language
but
the
existence
of
a
statute
like
this
gives
the
possibility
for
the
abuse
of
that
statute
by
the
police.
i
think
there
is
a
more
significant
first
amendment
interest
in
allowing
citizens
to
criticize
the
police
and
there
is
no
law
allowing
citizens
to
criticize
citizens.
in
the
libel
decisions
of
this
court
reflect
that
in
time
versus
pate,
st.
amant
versus
thompson,
this
court
has
held
the
police
to
be
public
officials
unless
entitled
to
somewhat
less
protection
than
a
purely
private
citizen
from
possibly
libelous
statements
by
the
press,
by
people
running
for
political
office.
and
i
think
that
all
of
the
decisions
in
the
past
show
that
public
officials
can
be
criticized
more
harshly
and
that
there
is
an
interest
in
permitting
that
sort
of
criticism.
to
the
extent
that
there
might
be
a
rational
for
allowing
a
broader
proscription
of
speech
when
that
speech
is
addressed
to
the
police
that
rational
is
not
addressed
by
the
ordinance
here.
the
question
of
interference
is
a
very
good
--
would
make
a
very
good
rationale
but
interference
is
not
the
object
of
the
statute.
and
colten
v.
kentucky
involved
an
interference
the
statute
was
addressed
to
that
sort
of
convict.
it
did
not
even
involve
any
obscene
or
opprobrious
language.
this
ordinance
--
an
ordinance
of
this
type
might
be
upheld
if
it
were
addressed
to
interferences
but
it
is
not.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
yes,
but
the
limitation
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
i
don’t
think
they
have
decided
that.
i
don’t
think
they
really
attack
the
question.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
that’s
possible.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
but
if
they
are
certainly
not
entitled
to
more
protection
unless
it
is
an
interference
type
rational.
but
the
statute
--
there’s
no
construction
of
the
statute
and
the
statute
or
its
face
is
not
directed
to
the
question
of
interference.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
i
think
the
constitution
requires
that
the
state
court
or
the
legislature
enacting
a
law
like
this
require
a
focus
on
all
the
attendant
circumstances
surrounding
the
utterance
and
that
they
cannot
adopt
a
per
se
rule
that
the
utterance
here
is
in
all
circumstances
fighting
words.
it
should
be
noted
that
the
court
below
did
not
have
the
record
before
it.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
yes,
i
think
the
first
amendment
would
prevent
that
because
the
first
amendment
prevents
the
proscription
of
free
speech
unless
you
can
point
to
an
identifiable
danger
from
that
speech.
and
the
legislature
simply
can’t
make
up
identifiable
dangers
that
do
not
exist.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
if
he
decided
that
they
were
likely
to
provoke
under
the
circumstances
uttered
they
were
likely
to
provoke
the
average
police
officer
to
violence,
yes.
if
that
were
the
findings,
i
think
that
is
what
the
finding
has
to
be,
not
the
average
citizen
but
the
average
police
officer.
the
ordinance
limits
itself
to
the
police.
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
the
standards
should
be
those
of
the
police.
because
i
don’t
think
--
i
think
that’s
required
because
the
police
are
not
as
sensitive
to
language
such
as
this
as
of
a
60-year-old
woman
would
be
or
even
the
average
citizen
might
be.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
no,
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor.
the
court
below
did
not
have
a
record
before
it.
and
therefore,
i
don’t
think
if
they
made
a
narrowing
construction,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
have
to
look
at
the
record
to
see
whether
the
appellant’s
speech
fit
it
in
into
that
narrowing
construction.
and
it
is
quite
clear
that
at
the
time
this
case
was
originally
remanded
from
this
court,
there
was
an
absolute
necessity
to
construe
that
statute,
to
limit
that
statute
at
some
way.
on
its
face,
it’s
remarkably
similar
not
nearly
as
good
even
as
the
statute
involved
in
gooding
versus
wilson.
so,
since
they
did
not
have
the
record
before
them,
i
don’t
see
how
they
can
possibly
have
made
any
finding
along
that
line.
all
they
had
before
them
was
mr.
justice
powell’s
comment
in
the
concurrence
of
the
remand
order
of
june
1972.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
the
answer
to
that
is
i
--
is
that
the
application
for
writs
was
made
to
louisiana
supreme
court.
it
does
not
require
that
the
record
be
sent
up.
if
the
application
for
writs
is
granted,
the
record
is
sent
up.
when
the
case
came
back
down
on
remand,
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
did
not
read
this
is
as
forcing
them
to
grant
writs
on
the
case
order
up
the
record
from
the
criminal
district
court
and
consider
the
whole
thing.
that
is
the
only
possible
explanation.
the
yvonne
martin
case
that
was
also
remanded
was
argued
twice
in
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
the
first
time
without
the
record
and
then
they
did
subsequently
order
up
the
record
in
that
case.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
that’s
right
and
the
judgment
is
correct
was
of
that
of
the
criminal
district
court
of
appeals
which
upheld
the
ordinance
very
clearly
on
its
face.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
because
i
complied
with
the
rule
of
this
court
at
that
time
which
was
either
had
just
been
changed
or
was
being
changed
that
required
that
the
record
be
sent
up.
and
that’s
simply
the
reason
why
it
was
here
and
--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
no,
it
did
not
go
back
to
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
it
maybe
still
here,
i
don’t
know.
it
was
my
own
copy,
the
copy
that
i
have
prepared
that
i
think
that
i
sent
up.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
the
trial
transcript
was
not
before
the
court.
footnote
one
to
the
majority’s
opinions
says,
“while
we
do
not
have
the
record
here
before
us,
we
note
from
mr.
justice
powell’s
concurrence
that
here,
the
appellant
uttered
the
words,
“god
damn
m.
f.
police.”
mr.
john
wilson
reed
that
was
not
before
the
court.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
the
only
they
have
was
my
original
application
for
writs
back
in
1970
or
1971
which
i
discussed
the
case,
the
legal
issues
but
was
no
transfer
of
that
application
for
writs.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
am
--
mr.
john
wilson

thank
you.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
unless
the
court
has
any
questions
your
honor,
i
have
nothing
further
to
say.
