you
mean
an

you
said
an
appeals
was
filed
a
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
moffitt’s
case
one
which
could
have
been
appealed
as
of
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
north
carolina
did
criminal
defendant
get
his
right
to
petition
for
certiorari
this
court
from
north
carolina
statute
or
from
act
of
congress.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
though
it’s
no
right
the
state
confers
them?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
the
denial
certiorari
maybe
of
no
precedental
significance
in
this
court
but
certainly
it
is
of
significance
to
the
litigant
that
petition
and
in
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you’re
addressing
yourself
now
just
to
the
writ
in
this
court
i
take
it,
it
is
not
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
by
the
adversary
process
mr.
anderson?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
for
instance
federal
habeas
is
not
part
of
the
adversary
process?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
the
extent
that
douglas
is
based
on
the
equal
protection
clause
the
idea
that
if
the
state
grants
the
right
of
appeal,
it
has
to
make
it
equally
available
to
everybody
regardless
of
money.
i
take,
would
you
agree
that
your
claim
for
appointment
of
counsel
and
this
court
is
a
weaker
one
and
your
claim
for
appointment
of
counsel
in
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina?
the
thought
being
the
north
carolina
doesn’t
confer
any
right
on
the
criminal
defendant
to
come
to
this
court
as
an
act
of
congress.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
douglas
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
state
didn’t
have
to
give
any
right
of
appeal
at
all?
now,
i
would
think
that
if
your
reasoning
is
right
that
part
of
douglas
is
wrong.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
if
it
is
established
by
the
state
i
certainly
see
that
that
you
can
make
a
point
on
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
but
do
you
think
the
equal
protection
argument
really
has
any
weight
at
all
in
the
discretionary
review
here?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
north
carolina
doesn’t
give
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the
test
is
conviction
that
you
are
attacking
a
conviction,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument
is
equally
applicable
the
habeas
where
you
are
certainly
attacking
a
state
conviction.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit,
which
held
that
the
state
of
north
carolina
must
furnish
a
convicted
defendant
counsel
to
seek
discretionary
review
of
his
conviction
in
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
and
to
seek
certiorari
here.
we
had
earlier
held
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
require
that
the
state
furnish
counsel
to
a
convicted
defendant
for
his
appeal
as
of
right
within
the
state
system,
but
we
conclude
here
that
neither
due
process
nor
equal
protection
require
that
respondent
receive
court-appointed
counsel
for
these
discretionary
appeals.
this
court
has
held
that
the
due
process
clause
does
not
require
states
to
provide
any
appeal
at
all
and
a
state
therefore
acts
unfairly,
only
if
it
denies
indigents
meaningful
access
to
any
appellate
system
that
is
set
up
because
of
their
poverty.
that
principle
which
overlaps
with
equal
protection
notions
has
not
been
violated
by
the
north
carolina
system
challenged
here.
at
the
time
a
defendant
in
respondent's
position
seeks
discretionary
appeal
in
the
north
carolina
supreme
court,he
will
have
a
transcript
of
the
trial
proceedings,
a
brief
prepared
by
a
counsel
for
his
appeal
as
of
right
to
the
north
carolina
intermediate
court
of
appeals
and
perhaps,
an
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
disposing
of
his
claim.
these
materials,
supplemented
by
whatever
submission
a
defendant
may
himself
make
should
be
sufficient
to
allow
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
to
decide
whether
the
case
has
a
significant
public
interest,
involves
legal
principles
of
major
significance
to
the
state
or
is
likely
to
be
in
conflict
with
the
prior
decisions
of
the
state
supreme
court,
the
standards
which
guide
that
court’s
decision
that
grant
or
deny
review.
likewise
we
do
not
believe
that
the
state
is
required
to
appoint
counsel
to
represent
a
criminal
defendant
on
his
petition
for
review
in
this
court.
our
review,
like
the
review
of
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
depends
on
discretionary
factors
other
than
the
perceived
correctness
of
the
decision
below
and
at
the
time
of
his
petition,
a
defendant
in
respondent's
circumstances
will
have
a
transcript
of
brief
and
one
or
even
two
opinions
of
lower
courts
with
which
to
present
his
petition
to
this
court.
in
addition,
we
know
that
the
right
to
seek
review
in
this
court
is
granted
not
by
any
state,
but
by
the
federal
statute
and
exists
regardless
of
the
willingness
of
a
state
to
have
the
decisions
of
its
highest
court
reviewed
here.
thus,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
constitution
requires
the
state
to
appoint
counsel
for
petitions
for
review
in
this
court.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit
is
reversed.
