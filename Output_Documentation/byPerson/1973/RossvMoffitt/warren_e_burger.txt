chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
number
73-786,
ross
against
moffitt.
mr.
safron
you
may
precede
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
the
state
courts
mainly
united
states,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
that
you
are
arguing
that
instead
of
4000
more
or
less
we
might
have
a
great
many
more.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
the
real
purpose
not
substantially
the
same
as
the
passage
of
the
so
called
certiorari
bill
in
1925
or
for
this
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
safron,
what’s
the
posture
that
mandate,
did
we
stay
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
see,
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
anderson?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
may
i
ask
you
--
see
this
will
--
clarified
for
me.
first
you
answer
all
the
tiers
that
are
provided
by
your
state
at
the
trial
court,
the
court
of
appeals,
the
supreme
court
and
then
you
go
in
to
the
federal
district
court
on
habeas
corpus
and
you
are
still
losing
and
so
you
are
taking
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
then,
at
that
stage
the
man
runs
out
of
money
and
no
longer
can
finance
an
appeal
or
a
petition
for
cert.
then,
under
the
fourth
circuit
holding
is
it
--
who
is
required
if
anyone
to
provide
the
counsel
to
prepare
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
coming
up
through
the
court
of
appeals,
federal
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
on
my
hypothetical
illustration,
the
man
has
had
the
five
tiers
into
judicial
process
state
and
federal
and
the
position
is
that
he
must
be
provided
with
three
counsel
to
prepare
a
petition
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
it
is
understood.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
carving
out
these
last
two
stages
because
it’s
not
direct
review
and
it’s
hardly
i
gather
because
you
view
it
as
a
civil?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
familiar
with
the
figures
in
the
federal
courts
on
the
increase
in
appeals
and
criminal
cases
from
district
court
judgments
to
the
court
of
appeal
after
it
became
free
under
the
criminal
justice
act
accompanied
by
the
bill
reforming?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
the
trend
was?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you’re
more
persuasive
than
some
counsel
because
the
pattern
in
many
districts
has
been
that
when
one
counsel
refused
to
take
an
appeal,
there
is
a
demand
for
another
counsel
and
that
continued
until
they
got
someone
who
would
take
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
state
has
done
this
as
a
matter
of
policy
up
to
this
point
have
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
sounds
like
a
pretty
good
policy
the
way
you
describe
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
decision
about
the
state
of
north
carolina
to
provide
this
assistance
has
been
one
of
decision
of
public
policy
by
the
legislature
perhaps
influenced
by
the
views
of
judges
or
perhaps
not
but
the
question
for
us
now
is
not
a
policy
question
but
whether
the
constitution
requires
it,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
ask
you
a
hypothetical
question
and
it
may
seem
extreme
but
i
want
to
test
it.
suppose
the
fourth
circuit
position
became
the
law
and
they’ve
gone
all
the
way
through
and
filed
a
petition
for
a
writ
here.
the
writ
is
denied,
is
there
a
constitutional
requirement
to
prepare
petition
for
rehearing
on
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
since
that's
open
to
every
litigant
as
a
discretionary
matter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
going
to
turn
this
last
decision
over
to
the
counsel
and
take
it
away
from
the
client?
well,
as
the
lawyer
advises
the
client
knows
there
is
no
point
in
filing
a
petition
for
rehearing
that
the
court
almost
never
grants
and
the
client
now
responds
i
want
a
petition
for
rehearing
trial.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
public
expense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
really
fair
on
the
constitutional
question
for
us
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
anderson.
you
have
about
three
minutes
left
mr.
safron,
if
you
need
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
safron.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
anderson
you
appeared
in
this
case
by
our
appointment
and
at
our
request
and
on
behalf
of
the
court
i
want
to
thank
you
for
you
assistance
to
the
court
and
to
your
client
of
course.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
disposition
of
number
73-786,
ross
against
moffitt
will
be
announced
by
mr.
