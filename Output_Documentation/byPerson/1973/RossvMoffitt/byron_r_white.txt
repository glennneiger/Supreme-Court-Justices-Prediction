white
is
that
a
full
court
reconsideration
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
wonder
this
is
like
a
majority
vote
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
in
north
carolina?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
will
he
would
be
taking
some
risk
if
he
didn't,
wouldn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
he
did
not
of
an
attack
later
and
post
conviction
is
something
of
an
effect
of
the
system
to
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
think
of
financial
burden
on
the
state
compensate
challenges
of
fourth
circuits?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
does
that
include
petitioning
in
your
supreme
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
your
north
carolina
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
satisfy
here
that
if
under
the
north
carolina
rules
a
copy
of
the
brief
in
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
and
a
copy
of
the
opinion
of
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
would
be
if
filed
in
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
would
be
an
adequate
filling,
would
be
considered
a
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
maybe
but
they
could
apply
that
whatever
criteria
they
are
going
to
apply
to
whatever
is
revealed
by
the
papers
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
maybe
that’s
the
burden
on
the
court
that
doesn’t
create
a
constitutional
right
in
view.
