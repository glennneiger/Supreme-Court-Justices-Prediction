douglas
mr.
safron
before
you
go
on
who
makes
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
substantial
question
of
federal
or
state
constitutional
law?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i'm
thinking
about
certiorari.
justice
william
o.
douglas
well,
somebody
must
make
that
decision
does
an
immediate
appellate
court
make
it
or
does
a
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
make
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
do
you
think
there
is
no
certification
by
the
intermediate
appellate
court?
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
safron
in
these
cases,
where
there
is
a
assertion
of
a
substantial
constitution
question
on
appeal
from
the
word,
whatever
it
is
from
the
court
of
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
in
a
criminal
case.
where
the
assertion
is
made
in
a
substantial
federal
question,
if
true
that
would
be
an
appeal
of
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
does
the
counsel
provide
it?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
how
about
preparation,
preparation
of
the
whether
we
have
appeal?
justice
william
o.
douglas
and
this
would
be
even
in
cases
where
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
refused
certiorari?
justice
william
o.
douglas
you
said
there
was
an
act
of
congress?
justice
william
o.
douglas
oh,
i’m
sorry
i
thought
my
brother
rehnquist
was
asking
about
appointment
of
counsel.
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
safron
i’m
just
puzzled,
i
don’t
understand
that
assuming
the
fourth
circuit
will
affirm?
why
does
this
mean
that
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
has
to
subside
more
of
these
criminal
cases
on
the
merits,
which
i
gather
they
don’t
when
they
refuse
certiorari.
now,
why
does
the
appointment
of
a
counsel
to
prepare
a
petition
for
certiorari
mean
that
it’s
going
to
be
that
much
more
for
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
to
decide?
justice
william
o.
douglas
well
then
you
must,
i
gather
what
you
must
be
arguing
that
is
that
if
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
a
counsel
that
counsel
must
prepare
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
william
o.
douglas
mr.
safron
may
i
--
while
i
have
you
interrupted.
did
the
fourth
circuit
say
that
counsel
provided
in
the
matter
of
counsel
--
the
court
said
constitutionally
had
--we
have
to
be
provided.
also
say
that
the
state
had
to
pay
him
for
the
services?
justice
william
o.
douglas
said
in
so
many
words.
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
don’t
know
if
find
that
i
think,
does
it
not?
ordinarily
compensate
attorneys
not
alone
at
trial
and
direct
review
but
also
on
the
state
post
conviction.
