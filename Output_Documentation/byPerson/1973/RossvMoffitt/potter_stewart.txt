justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
intermediate
appellate
court
in
virginia?
justice
potter
stewart
we
are
talking
about
the
criminal
cases
only
here?
justice
potter
stewart
only?
justice
potter
stewart
directly?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
ask,
to
go
from
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
supreme
court
on
an
application
what
do
you
call
this?
justice
potter
stewart
petition
for
writ
certiorari?
is
there
any
situations
on
appeal
of
right
on
a
division
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
of
right?
justice
potter
stewart
how
many
votes
does
it
take
to
grant
in
the
court
of
appeals?
i
mean
in
the
supreme
court?
justice
potter
stewart
the
courts
describing
is
a
situation
other
--
what
we
are
talking
about
is
exactly
the
appellate
system
except
that,
it
takes
three
votes
over
the
seven
of
the
justices
in
the
supreme
court
to
grant
a
view
of
what
we
call
a
petition
for
certification
rather
than
the
writ
of
certiorari.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
a
person
could
appeal
asserting
that
a
important
or
substantial
or
whatever
your
words
are,
question
of
federal
or
state
constitutional
law
were
involved
and
then
it
might
be
up
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
works.
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
where
the
decision
is
made
as
i
suppose,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
the
assertion
is
made
by
the
appellant
and
the
decision
is
made
by
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
supreme
court.
no,
your
mistaken.
there
is
not
of
substantial
constitutional
question
but
possibly
they
might
go
on
to
say.
however,
we’ll
consider
this
as
a
what
you
call
motion
to
certify?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
was
granted
because
there
is
an
evidentiary
question
involved
here
or
something
like
that.
justice
potter
stewart
that
happened?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
i
suppose
if
there
is
a
lawyer
he
will
nominate
his
papers
both
in
appeal
and
alternatively
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari?
justice
potter
stewart
and
separately.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
no,
the
certiorari
jurisdiction.
justice
potter
stewart
and
now
that
you’re
interrupted,
may
i
ask
other
question
about
north
carolina
practice,
is
there
an
argument
ever
on
the
papers
on
the
appeal
or
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina?
justice
potter
stewart
only
if
there
is
a
grant?
justice
potter
stewart
similar
to
this
court.
justice
potter
stewart
the
system
you
described
is
almost
identical
with
that
it
might
state
of
ohio
except
in
ohio
there
is
a
15
minute
argument
on
the
most
--
what
we
call
a
motion
to
certify.
you
don’t
have
that?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
a
equivalent
in
affirmance,
in
other
words.
justice
potter
stewart
why
should
the
state
have
to
commence
an
appeal
here?
justice
potter
stewart
oh,
i
know
but
exactly
about
the
constitution.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that’s
what
the
fourth
circuit
decision?
justice
potter
stewart
if
there
is
a
substantial
constitutional
claim
as
a
constitutional
right
that
counsel
is
preparing
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari?
justice
potter
stewart
which
the
state
is
going
to
pay
for
under
the
fourth
circuit.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
but
it
is
nevertheless
the
federal
constitution
in
the
federal
court
system
that
is
involved.
justice
potter
stewart
what
is
the
percentage
of
criminal
cases
or
something
they
reviewed
here
from
affirmances
by
the
north
carolina
supreme
court?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
do
you
know
how
many
petition,
what
percentage
of
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals,
criminal
cases
in
court
of
appeals
are
sought
to
be
reviewed
here?
justice
potter
stewart
all
right,
three
or
four
counties
experimentally
have
provided
counsel
haven’t
they?
justice
potter
stewart
so
that
at
least
for
these
three
counties
the
--
and
at
least
to
the
state
supreme
court
apart
from
--
justice
potter
stewart
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court.
the
state
is
now
providing
what
did
court
of
appeals
of
fourth
circuits
must
provide
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
no
intermediate
appellate
court
in
virginia?
justice
potter
stewart
we
are
talking
about
the
