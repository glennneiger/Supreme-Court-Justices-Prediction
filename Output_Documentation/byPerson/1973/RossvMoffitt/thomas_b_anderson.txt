mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
gillian
and
douglas
are
now
all
over
ten
years
old
since
their
decision,
the
principle
that
fundamental
in
due
process
and
equal
protection
is
that
in
trial
in
all
appeal,
an
indigent
defendant
must
have
counsel
appointment
for
him
if
he
cannot
afford
it.
and
that
principle
has
been
expanded
or
further
delineated
to
hold
that
the
right
is
not
diluted
by
the
nature
of
the
offense
so
long
as
imprisonment
is
threatened
or
by
the
age
of
the
defendant
versus
in
juvenile
cases.
mr.
safron
pointed
out
the
right
attaches
at
the
beginning
or
at
the
issuance
of
formal
adversary
proceedings
usually
by
indictment.
now,
the
question
in
which
we
have
before
us
today
is
whether
or
not
after
the
right
accrues
and
further
along
in
the
adversary
process
whether
or
not
the
right
the
measure
diminishes
or
disappears
or
we
put
another
way
whether
or
not
the
right
attaches
according
to
the
nature
of
the
court
or
how
far
long
the
adversary
process
the
court
might
happened
to
be.
in
1969,
the
tenth
and
the
seventh
circuit
decide
that
indeed
the
right
to
counsel
stopped
after
the
first
appeal.
the
courts
there
limiting
their
decision
to
the
facts
in
douglas.
more
recently
however
the
fourth
circuit
and
now
the
sixth
circuit
find
that
the
right
does
continue
on
throughout
the
adversary
proceedings.
this
court
is
already
familiar
with
the
background
of
the
case
(inaudible)
in
this
particular
court
and
the
mecklenburg
case,
the
defendant
received
a
letter
from
his
attorney
stating
that
after
his
first
appeal
that
he
had
approached
the
superior
court,
the
court
in
our
state,
and
have
been
informed
that
he
no
longer
could
represent
him
because
there
was
no
longer
the
right
to
counsel.
thereupon
the
right
to
counsel
in
that
particular
case
seized
and
the
guilford
county
case,
the
public
defender
in
that
county
representing
the
defendant
and
carried
it
through
the
discretionary
review
in
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
but
did
not
carry
it
to
this
court.
what
we
have
before
us
today
perhaps
is
very
defined
and
what
we
do
not
have
before
us.
we
are
not
deciding
or
this
court
does
not
want
to
decide
or
have
to
decide
whether
right
to
counsel
exists
before
or
after
the
adversary
process
begins
or
ends.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
the
kirby
decision
mr.
justice
rehnquist
delineates
that
the
right
to
counsel
accrues
when
the
adversary
--
formal
adversary
proceedings
are
instituted
or
indictment
warrant.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
whether
its
adversary
nature
it’s
not
--
it
doesn’t
emanate
from
the
actual
accusation
of
the
trial.
it's
an
attack,
in
fact
civil
in
nature
as
viewed
by
the
courts
and
the
defendant's
attack
upon
his
conviction
rather
than
the
other
way
around.
he
is
defending
and
when
i
term
the
adversary
procedures
on
direct
review
but
federal
habeas
corpus
i
think
is
a
little
bit
different.
nature
even
though
it
does
involve
the
adversary
process
is
not
the
criminal
process
because
the
defendant
is
already
convicted,
his
judgment
is
final.
and
it’s
that
particular
judgment,
he
is
in
fact
seeking
no
parole.
so,
we
are
not
asking
for
counsel
on
post
conviction
or
federal
habeas
corpus,
although
on
many
occasions
they
are
appointed.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
on
habeas
corpus?
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
know
of
no
provision
other
than
the
criminal
justice
act
and
that
act
provides
that
once
counsel
is
appointed
by
the
fourth
circuit
for
argument
in
the
fourth
circuit,
that
the
attorney
shall
not
abandon
his
client
that
if
he
wins
that
he
shall
and
petition
for
certiorari
is
made
by
the
opposite
side,
and
he
shall
answer
the
petition
and
shall
continue
in
the
case
until
this
court
either
release
him
or
further
appoints
him.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
no,
that
is
what
i
would
term
a
collateral
proceeding
as
opposed
to
direct
review
where
the
defendant
had
his
conviction
affirmed
by
appellate
court
and
seeks
discretionary
review
by
the
highest
state
court
or
discretionary
review
by
this
court
after
failing
to
gain
either
review
or
reversal
in
the
highest
state
court.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
well,
traditionally
i
haven’t
viewed
civil
in
nature
and
they
are
not
direct
review
although
the
court’s
have
used
the
discretion
to
appoint
counsel
in
particular
cases
where
they’re
needed.
indeed
that’s
not
what
i
am
arguing
here
the
judgment
isn’t
final
so
to
speak
until
the
final
appellate
court
has
made
their
decision
either
to
review
it
or
to
affirm
or
to
reverse.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
that’s
true
your
honor
but
the
state
does
convict
the
defendant
and
it's
that
state
trial
that's
being
reviewed
and
for
the
defendant
of
means
who
can't
afford
to
take
review
whether
by
act
of
congress
or
by
act
of
the
north
carolina
legislature.
the
particular
criminal
proceeding
being
reviewed
is
a
state
prosecution.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
for
the
state
as
i
read
the
statute
your
honor,
statute
requires
the
state
to
do
so,
i
have
set
that
statute
on
page
three
of
my
brief
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
the
constitution,
i
see
no
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
well,
the
fourth
circuit’s
decision
remanded
it
for
a
determination
and
whether
or
not
there
was
a
substantial
constitutional
claim
and
if
there
was
then
the
state
had
to
afford
counsel
to
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
that’s
correct
your
honor.
they
will
pay
for
it
but
still
it’s
their
conviction
and
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
the
state
of
north
carolina
of
course,
would
be
the
court
will
be
the
executive
agency
which
will
imprison
the
defendant
and
it
is
the
state
which
initially
sought
the
conviction
and
congress
of
course
puts
a
remedy
by
way
of
certiorari
on
this
court.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
do
not,
i
have
no
statistics
as
to
how
many
are
or
whether
or
not
they
are
represented
by
counsel
or
not.
i
might
say
this
that
if
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that
one.
i
do
know
that
a
very
small
majority,
a
very
small
number
of
cases
are
even
appealed
from
the
trial
court
level.
most
cases
are
supposed
of
by
guilty
plea.
so
very
few
cases
even
reach
the
first
appellate
level.
i
think
the
argument
that
affirming
the
fourth
circuit
would
create
flood
or
a
litigation
in
this
court
not
here
forseen
might
be
stretching
our
imagination
and
also
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
you
are
asking
me
mr.
chief
justice
am
i
familiar
with
the
figures?
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
think
the
trend
and
i
am
only
reaching
back
and
my
memory
was
that
there
was
no
substantial
change.
i
think
the
trend
was
first
encountered
in
--
when
this
court
was
concerned
about
right
to
counsel
for
probation
and
before
marcy
and
scapelli.
at
that
point
i
do
not
know
and
i
cannot
say
whether
or
not
that
is
increased
or
decreased.
however,
i
would
submit
that
the
denial
with
equal
protection
still
remains
the
same
if
the
state
were
to
establish
a
five
or
ten
tier
system
and
i
don’t
mean
to
be
precocious
that
the
indigents
will
have
just
as
much
right
to
have
counsel
before
the
third,
fourth
or
fifth
tier
as
his
more
wealthy
companion.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
would
your
honor
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
remedy
exists
to
review
a
state
court
conviction.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
it
doesn’t
give
the
remedy
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
it’s
a
process
that
you’re
attacking
the
conviction
that
i
would
assume
--
i
would
say
would
be
the
difference.
in
one
the
defendant
or
the
former
defendant
is
in
adversary
seeking
the
attorney
final
judgment
whereas
in
one
the
final
judgment
is
still
theoretically
reached
open
until
he
has
let
the
time
run
and
that
would
be
my
position
in
answer
to
your
question.
the
federal
practice
of
course
does
provide
right
to
counsel
in
all
stages
and
i
think
that
this
is
of
course
done
by
statute
and
not
by
decision
of
this
court
except
of
course
by
interpretation.
the
argument
that
there
would
be
created
flood
type
presents
another
problem
and
that
it
would
be
admitting
that
there
are
defendants
who
are
deterred
from
seeking
a
high
review
because
they
can’t
afford
a
counsel.
and
i
would
say
that
this
deprivation
itself
is
on
its
face
now
with
equal
protection.
if
counsel
is
appointed
on
the
other
hand,
i
don’t
think
that
counsel
either
being
a
member
of
this
court
or
member
of
the
supreme
court
bar
of
our
state
would
be
so
presumptuous
as
to
insist
that
he
take
every
appeal
or
petition
for
direct
review
that
every
client
asks
him
to
take.
if
the
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
if
he
did
not
or
he
did?
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
well,
that
would
presuming
that
the
defendant
and
the
counsel
had
a
dialog
which
in
most
cases
they
do.
and
it
was
my
personal
experience
most
--
in
fact
every
defendant
i
have
ever
represented
has
taken
my
advice
not
to
proceed
further
than
the
highest
state
court
because
there
is
no
substantial
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
would
say
that
would
be
the
exception
rather
than
rules
mr.
chief
justice
that
most
cases
you
would
find
that
the
defendant
would
see
that
his
counsel
is
not
as
adversary
but
is
representative
and
therefore
seeking
that
the
root
or
the
remedy
that
is
best
for
him.
in
those
cases
where
the
man
insists
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court
or
to
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
he
would
take
it
whether
or
not
he
has
counsel
if
he
is
going
to
be
so
insistent.
he
will
take
it
anyway
which
puts
this
court
and
our
supreme
court
with
the
problem
of
trying
to
decide
from
his
and
letter
of
petition
in
many
cases,
whether
or
not
this
case
does
have
merit.
the
burden
is
very
small
i
would
think,
in
fact
i
would
submit
that
it’s
a
grievous
waste.
you
already
have
counsel
through
one
appeal.
he’s
familiar
with
the
issues,
he
is
more
than
likely,
he
has
tried
the
case,
he
is
going
through
the
record
and
has
appealed
and
now
all
that’s
left
is
to
fashion
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
a
high
state
court
or
to
this
court.
other
than
any
other
method
would
require
someone
new
taking
over
the
case
perhaps
the
law
clerk
and/or
even
perhaps
the
writ
writer
in
one
of
the
state's
prisons.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
think
the
financial
burden
would
be
very
small.
it’s
my
experience
that
state
superior
court
judges
who
award
the
counsel
fees
after
the
process
is
through.
the
counsel
submits
a
time
list
to
the
superior
court
judge
who
then
determines
the
nature
of
the
case
and
how
much
time
is
involved,
what
the
award
is
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
would
put
it
this
way
the
--
i
read
the
statute,
the
enabling
statute
to
say
that
we
are
required
to
do
so.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
do
your
honor
and
in
the
appendix
to
the
fourth
circuit
brief,
there
is
a
letter
from
the
administrative
office
of
the
courts
which
states
that
the
administrative
office
pays
for
at
least
in
those
cases
where
the
petitioner
or
the
defendant
went
to
the
higher
state
court.
and
the
statute
itself
reads
direct
review
even
in
the
supreme
court
of
united
states.
so,
the
legislatures
are
provided
of
financial
remedy
for
a
situations.
now,
all
we
have
got
to
do
is
to
get
the
courts
to
uphold
the
--
what
i
would
say
would
be
intent
of
the
legislature
however,
the
attorney
general’s
office
and
the
courts
have
interpreted
the
statute
very
narrowly.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
think
there
has
been
no
policy
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
maybe
i
miss-interpreted
your
question.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
chief
justice
it
is
and
the
policy
of
the
legislature
however
it
didn’t
intend
that
it
might
be
is
of
no
importance
when
the
courts
don’t
interpret
the
policy
the
same
way
which
is
what
i
would
submit
we
have
here.
that
the
policy
of
legislature
was
to
get
a
full
right
to
counsel
on
any
direct
review
which
would
include
the
full
tier
from
the
superior
court
level
all
the
way
up
to
this
court.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
would
say
that
the
only
constitutional
mandate
that
would
be
there
would
be
whether
or
not
the
traditional
notions
of
when
this
court
does
rehear
a
case
are
met.
the
same
value
judgment
which
is
made
by
counsel
after
the
first
appeal
stage
whether
or
not
there
is
a
substantial
constitutional
question,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
substantial
question
of
public
importance
or
interest
to
the
judicial
bar
of
the
state.
all
these
very
judges
are
made
along
the
way
and
i
would
say
in
answer
to
your
question
that
it
would
be
required
if
counsel
thought
it
would
be
and
if
in
this
particular
instance
the
demand
by
the
defendant
that
he
be
afforded
or
review
where
the
review
is
already
taking
place
in
the
same
court
never
be
to
carry
it
here.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
in
that
particular
case,
i
think
he
is
required
to
do
so.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
at
public
expense.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
that
in
most
instances
that
the
average
defendant
even
after
being
advised
that
you
can't
have
rehearing
would
not
take
advantage
of
that
and
would
call
as
counsel’s
advice.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
it
does,
if
you
are
worried
about
the
balancing
of
the
burden
is
in
the
implementing
decision
as
opposed
to
the
mandate
or
the
strength
of
the
mandate,
the
constitution
requires.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
say
that
our
notions
of
basic
fairness
and
justice
would
mandate
that
the
defendant
not
be
settled
on
his
own
that
he
be
given
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
so
to
speak.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
white
it
wouldn’t
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all
if
it
was
considered
adequate
and
i
think
it
would
have
been
done
before.
secondly,
the
criteria
which
the
supreme
court
uses
on
discretionary
review
is
quite
different
than
those
in
appellate
court.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
which
would
require
the
court
to
take
the
task
of
reasons
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
well,
it
does
in
the
sense
that
the
indigent
defendant
therefore
puts
the
court
to
a
burden
which
is
more
wealthy
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
the
only
objection
is
that
the
defendant
of
means
has
counsel
who
can
layout
the
contentions
which
he
feels
will
catch
the
court’s
eye
which
will
when
the
petition
comes
across
their
desk
for
review
will
be
--
was
so
to
speak
jump
out
at
the
justice
as
opposed
to
here
is
another
brief.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
well,
i
would
feel
and
we
think
that
with
this
court’s
burden
that
the
counsel
would
aid
the

gillian
and
douglas
are
now
all
over
ten
years
old
since
their
decision,
the
principle
that
fundamental
in
due
process
and
equal
protection
is
that
in
trial
in
all
appeal,
an
indigent
defendant
must
have
counsel
appointment
for
him
if
he
cannot
afford
it.
and
that
principle
has
been
expanded
or
further
delineated
to
hold
that
the
right
is
not
diluted
by
the
nature
of
the
offense
so
long
as
imprisonment
is
threatened
or
by
the
age
of
the
defendant
versus
in
juvenile
cases.
mr.
safron
pointed
out
the
right
attaches
at
the
beginning
or
at
the
issuance
of
formal
adversary
proceedings
usually
by
indictment.
now,
the
question
in
which
we
have
before
us
today
is
whether
or
not
after
the
right
accrues
and
further
along
in
the
adversary
process
whether
or
not
the
right
the
measure
diminishes
or
disappears
or
we
put
another
way
whether
or
not
the
right
attaches
according
to
the
nature
of
the
court
or
how
far
long
the
adversary
process
the
court
might
happened
to
be.
in
1969,
the
tenth
and
the
seventh
circuit
decide
that
indeed
the
right
to
counsel
stopped
after
the
first
appeal.
the
courts
there
limiting
their
decision
to
the
facts
in
douglas.
more
recently
however
the
fourth
circuit
and
now
the
sixth
circuit
find
that
the
right
does
continue
on
throughout
the
adversary
proceedings.
this
court
is
already
familiar
with
the
background
of
the
case
(inaudible)
in
this
particular
court
and
the
mecklenburg
case,
the
defendant
received
a
letter
from
his
attorney
stating
that
after
his
first
appeal
that
he
had
approached
the
superior
court,
the
court
in
our
state,
and
have
been
informed
that
he
no
longer
could
represent
him
because
there
was
no
longer
the
right
to
counsel.
thereupon
the
right
to
counsel
in
that
particular
case
seized
and
the
guilford
county
case,
the
public
defender
in
that
county
representing
the
defendant
and
carried
it
through
the
discretionary
review
in
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
but
did
not
carry
it
to
this
court.
what
we
have
before
us
today
perhaps
is
very
defined
and
what
we
do
not
have
before
us.
we
are
not
deciding
or
this
court
does
not
want
to
decide
or
have
to
decide
whether
right
to
counsel
exists
before
or
after
the
adversary
process
begins
or
ends.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
the
kirby
decision
mr.
justice
rehnquist
delineates
that
the
right
to
counsel
accrues
when
the
adversary
--
formal
adversary
proceedings
are
instituted
or
indictment
warrant.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
whether
its
adversary
nature
it’s
not
--
it
doesn’t
emanate
from
the
actual
accusation
of
the
trial.
it's
an
attack,
in
fact
civil
in
nature
as
viewed
by
the
courts
and
the
defendant's
attack
upon
his
conviction
rather
than
the
other
way
around.
he
is
defending
and
when
i
term
the
adversary
procedures
on
direct
review
but
federal
habeas
corpus
i
think
is
a
little
bit
different.
nature
even
though
it
does
involve
the
adversary
process
is
not
the
criminal
process
because
the
defendant
is
already
convicted,
his
judgment
is
final.
and
it’s
that
particular
judgment,
he
is
in
fact
seeking
no
parole.
so,
we
are
not
asking
for
counsel
on
post
conviction
or
federal
habeas
corpus,
although
on
many
occasions
they
are
appointed.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
on
habeas
corpus?
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
know
of
no
provision
other
than
the
criminal
justice
act
and
that
act
provides
that
once
counsel
is
appointed
by
the
fourth
circuit
for
argument
in
the
fourth
circuit,
that
the
attorney
shall
not
abandon
his
client
that
if
he
wins
that
he
shall
and
petition
for
certiorari
is
made
by
the
opposite
side,
and
he
shall
answer
the
petition
and
shall
continue
in
the
case
until
this
court
either
release
him
or
further
appoints
him.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
no,
that
is
what
i
would
term
a
collateral
proceeding
as
opposed
to
direct
review
where
the
defendant
had
his
conviction
affirmed
by
appellate
court
and
seeks
discretionary
review
by
the
highest
state
court
or
discretionary
review
by
this
court
after
failing
to
gain
either
review
or
reversal
in
the
highest
state
court.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
well,
traditionally
i
haven’t
viewed
civil
in
nature
and
they
are
not
direct
review
although
the
court’s
have
used
the
discretion
to
appoint
counsel
in
particular
cases
where
they’re
needed.
indeed
that’s
not
what
i
am
arguing
here
the
judgment
isn’t
final
so
to
speak
until
the
final
appellate
court
has
made
their
decision
either
to
review
it
or
to
affirm
or
to
reverse.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
that’s
true
your
honor
but
the
state
does
convict
the
defendant
and
it's
that
state
trial
that's
being
reviewed
and
for
the
defendant
of
means
who
can't
afford
to
take
review
whether
by
act
of
congress
or
by
act
of
the
north
carolina
legislature.
the
particular
criminal
proceeding
being
reviewed
is
a
state
prosecution.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
for
the
state
as
i
read
the
statute
your
honor,
statute
requires
the
state
to
do
so,
i
have
set
that
statute
on
page
three
of
my
brief
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
the
constitution,
i
see
no
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
well,
the
fourth
circuit’s
decision
remanded
it
for
a
determination
and
whether
or
not
there
was
a
substantial
constitutional
claim
and
if
there
was
then
the
state
had
to
afford
counsel
to
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
yes.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
that’s
correct
your
honor.
they
will
pay
for
it
but
still
it’s
their
conviction
and
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
the
state
of
north
carolina
of
course,
would
be
the
court
will
be
the
executive
agency
which
will
imprison
the
defendant
and
it
is
the
state
which
initially
sought
the
conviction
and
congress
of
course
puts
a
remedy
by
way
of
certiorari
on
this
court.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
do
not,
i
have
no
statistics
as
to
how
many
are
or
whether
or
not
they
are
represented
by
counsel
or
not.
i
might
say
this
that
if
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
don’t
know
the
answer
to
that
one.
i
do
know
that
a
very
small
majority,
a
very
small
number
of
cases
are
even
appealed
from
the
trial
court
level.
most
cases
are
supposed
of
by
guilty
plea.
so
very
few
cases
even
reach
the
first
appellate
level.
i
think
the
argument
that
affirming
the
fourth
circuit
would
create
flood
or
a
litigation
in
this
court
not
here
forseen
might
be
stretching
our
imagination
and
also
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
you
are
asking
me
mr.
chief
justice
am
i
familiar
with
the
figures?
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
think
the
trend
and
i
am
only
reaching
back
and
my
memory
was
that
there
was
no
substantial
change.
i
think
the
trend
was
first
encountered
in
--
when
this
court
was
concerned
about
right
to
counsel
for
probation
and
before
marcy
and
scapelli.
at
that
point
i
do
not
know
and
i
cannot
say
whether
or
not
that
is
increased
or
decreased.
however,
i
would
submit
that
the
denial
with
equal
protection
still
remains
the
same
if
the
state
were
to
establish
a
five
or
ten
tier
system
and
i
don’t
mean
to
be
precocious
that
the
indigents
will
have
just
as
much
right
to
have
counsel
before
the
third,
fourth
or
fifth
tier
as
his
more
wealthy
companion.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
would
your
honor
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
remedy
exists
to
review
a
state
court
conviction.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
it
doesn’t
give
the
remedy
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
it’s
a
process
that
you’re
attacking
the
conviction
that
i
would
assume
--
i
would
say
would
be
the
difference.
in
one
the
defendant
or
the
former
defendant
is
in
adversary
seeking
the
attorney
final
judgment
whereas
in
one
the
final
judgment
is
still
theoretically
reached
open
until
he
has
let
the
time
run
and
that
would
be
my
position
in
answer
to
your
question.
the
federal
practice
of
course
does
provide
right
to
counsel
in
all
stages
and
i
think
that
this
is
of
course
done
by
statute
and
not
by
decision
of
this
court
except
of
course
by
interpretation.
the
argument
that
there
would
be
created
flood
type
presents
another
problem
and
that
it
would
be
admitting
that
there
are
defendants
who
are
deterred
from
seeking
a
high
review
because
they
can’t
afford
a
counsel.
and
i
would
say
that
this
deprivation
itself
is
on
its
face
now
with
equal
protection.
if
counsel
is
appointed
on
the
other
hand,
i
don’t
think
that
counsel
either
being
a
member
of
this
court
or
member
of
the
supreme
court
bar
of
our
state
would
be
so
presumptuous
as
to
insist
that
he
take
every
appeal
or
petition
for
direct
review
that
every
client
asks
him
to
take.
if
the
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
if
he
did
not
or
he
did?
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
well,
that
would
presuming
that
the
defendant
and
the
counsel
had
a
dialog
which
in
most
cases
they
do.
and
it
was
my
personal
experience
most
--
in
fact
every
defendant
i
have
ever
represented
has
taken
my
advice
not
to
proceed
further
than
the
highest
state
court
because
there
is
no
substantial
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
would
say
that
would
be
the
exception
rather
than
rules
mr.
chief
justice
that
most
cases
you
would
find
that
the
defendant
would
see
that
his
counsel
is
not
as
adversary
but
is
representative
and
therefore
seeking
that
the
root
or
the
remedy
that
is
best
for
him.
in
those
cases
where
the
man
insists
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court
or
to
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
he
would
take
it
whether
or
not
he
has
counsel
if
he
is
going
to
be
so
insistent.
he
will
take
it
anyway
which
puts
this
court
and
our
supreme
court
with
the
problem
of
trying
to
decide
from
his
and
letter
of
petition
in
many
cases,
whether
or
not
this
case
does
have
merit.
the
burden
is
very
small
i
would
think,
in
fact
i
would
submit
that
it’s
a
grievous
waste.
you
already
have
counsel
through
one
appeal.
he’s
familiar
with
the
issues,
he
is
more
than
likely,
he
has
tried
the
case,
he
is
going
through
the
record
and
has
appealed
and
now
all
that’s
left
is
to
fashion
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
a
high
state
court
or
to
this
court.
other
than
any
other
method
would
require
someone
new
taking
over
the
case
perhaps
the
law
clerk
and/or
even
perhaps
the
writ
writer
in
one
of
the
state's
prisons.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
think
the
financial
burden
would
be
very
small.
it’s
my
experience
that
state
superior
court
judges
who
award
the
counsel
fees
after
the
process
is
through.
the
counsel
submits
a
time
list
to
the
superior
court
judge
who
then
determines
the
nature
of
the
case
and
how
much
time
is
involved,
what
the
award
is
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
would
put
it
this
way
the
--
i
read
the
statute,
the
enabling
statute
to
say
that
we
are
required
to
do
so.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
do
your
honor
and
in
the
appendix
to
the
fourth
circuit
brief,
there
is
a
letter
from
the
administrative
office
of
the
courts
which
states
that
the
administrative
office
pays
for
at
least
in
those
cases
where
the
petitioner
or
the
defendant
went
to
the
higher
state
court.
and
the
statute
itself
reads
direct
review
even
in
the
supreme
court
of
united
states.
so,
the
legislatures
are
provided
of
financial
remedy
for
a
situations.
now,
all
we
have
got
to
do
is
to
get
the
courts
to
uphold
the
--
what
i
would
say
would
be
intent
of
the
legislature
however,
the
attorney
general’s
office
and
the
courts
have
interpreted
the
statute
very
narrowly.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
think
there
has
been
no
policy
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
maybe
i
miss-interpreted
your
question.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
chief
justice
it
is
and
the
policy
of
the
legislature
however
it
didn’t
intend
that
it
might
be
is
of
no
importance
when
the
courts
don’t
interpret
the
policy
the
same
way
which
is
what
i
would
submit
we
have
here.
that
the
policy
of
legislature
was
to
get
a
full
right
to
counsel
on
any
direct
review
which
would
include
the
full
tier
from
the
superior
court
level
all
the
way
up
to
this
court.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
i
would
say
that
the
only
constitutional
mandate
that
would
be
there
would
be
whether
or
not
the
traditional
notions
of
when
this
court
does
rehear
a
case
are
met.
the
same
value
judgment
which
is
made
by
counsel
after
the
first
appeal
stage
whether
or
not
there
is
a
substantial
constitutional
question,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
substantial
question
of
public
importance
or
interest
to
the
judicial
bar
of
the
state.
all
these
very
judges
are
made
along
the
way
and
i
would
say
in
answer
to
your
question
that
it
would
be
required
if
counsel
thought
it
would
be
and
if
in
this
particular
instance
the
demand
by
the
defendant
that
he
be
afforded
or
review
where
the
review
is
already
taking
place
in
the
same
court
never
be
to
carry
it
here.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
in
that
particular
case,
i
think
he
is
required
to
do
so.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
at
public
expense.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
that
in
most
instances
that
the
average
defendant
even
after
being
advised
that
you
can't
have
rehearing
would
not
take
advantage
of
that
and
would
call
as
counsel’s
advice.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
it
does,
if
you
are
worried
about
the
balancing
of
the
burden
is
in
the
implementing
decision
as
opposed
to
the
mandate
or
the
strength
of
the
mandate,
the
constitution
requires.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
say
that
our
notions
of
basic
fairness
and
justice
would
mandate
that
the
defendant
not
be
settled
on
his
own
that
he
be
given
the
guiding
hand
of
counsel
so
to
speak.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
no,
mr.
justice
white
it
wouldn’t
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all
if
it
was
considered
adequate
and
i
think
it
would
have
been
done
before.
secondly,
the
criteria
which
the
supreme
court
uses
on
discretionary
review
is
quite
different
than
those
in
appellate
court.
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
which
would
require
the
court
to
take
the
task
of
reasons
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
well,
it
does
in
the
sense
that
the
indigent
defendant
therefore
puts
the
court
to
a
burden
which
is
more
wealthy
--
mr.
thomas
b.
anderson,
jr.
the
only
objection
is
that
the
defendant
of
means
has
counsel
who
can
layout
the
contentions
which
he

mr.

well,
i
would
feel
and
we
think
that
with
this
court’s
burden
that
the
counsel
would
aid
the
court
and
by
aiding
the
court
it
will
aid
the
defendant
because
he
would
have
the
assurance
that
his
cause
has
been
past
upon
by
having
his
cause
stated
clearly
or
rather
than
having
it
stated
in
terms
–
aimed
to
either
different
court
of

his
own
words.
thank
you.
