mr.
jacob
l.
safron
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
upon
a
petition
for
the
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
to
review
that
question
reserved
by
this
court
in
its
opinion
in
douglas
versus
california.
that
is
whether
or
not
the
constitution
mandates
the
requirement
of
counsel
to
be
appointed
for
indigent
defendants
to
seek
discretionary
review.
that
is
discretionary
review
from
the
highest
court
of
a
state
to
this
court
and
to
the
highest
court
of
a
state
in
those
states
which
have
multi-tiered
appellate
systems.
in
the
consolidated
moffitt
cases
the
fourth
circuit
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
issue
reserved
in
douglas
should
be
answered
in
the
affirmative.
although
all
courts
which
had
reviewed
the
question
prior
to
moffitt
had
answered
this
question
in
the
negative.
the
fourth
circuit
drew
an
analogy
between
the
north
carolina
appellate
system
and
the
virginia
appellate
system
and
by
joining
this
analogy
found
the
north
carolina
system
to
be
inadequate.
we
argue
that
this
analogy
is
itself
faulty.
in
the
state
of
virginia
there
is
no
appeal
as
of
right.
all
review
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
is
by
writ
of
error
to
this
supreme
court
of
virginia
and
counsel
is
appointed
until
by
the
fourth
circuit
and
to
represent
all
petitioners
seeking
a
writ
of
error
to
this
supreme
court
of
virginia.
and
that
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
accepts
enough
cases
to
keep
the
law
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
current.
in
north
carolina
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
not
at
all
your
honor
and
nor
is
there
are
any
appeals
as
a
right
in
virginia.
now,
that
is
the
virginia
system.
counsel
is
appointed
to
seek
the
writ
of
error
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh,
yes
your
honor.
we
are
talking
about
criminal
matters
here.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
and
i
am
advised
that
in
the
state
of
virginia
the
writ
of
error
if
it’s
denied
is
summarily
denied.
there
is
no
briefing,
there
is
no
opinion.
now,
in
this
state
of
north
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
really
can’t
speak
for
state
of
virginia
your
honor,
i’m
told
that
it
is
possible
and
this
is
going
to
the
fourth
circuit
that
oral
argument
can
be
had
by
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner
in
support
of
his
petition
but
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
have
to
plead
on
that
fact
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
okay,
in
north
carolina
we
have
a
multi-tiered
system.
we
have
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
and
we
have
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
appeal
is
as
a
right
from
the
trial
courts
to
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
except
in
a
case
in
which
a
sentence
is
death
or
life
imprisonment
and
in
that
case
the
appeal
is
a
right
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
direct
appeal
as
a
right
if
the
sentence
is
death
or
life
imprisonment
due
bypass
the
court
of
appeals
and
go
to
the
supreme
court.
all
other
cases
appeal
is
as
of
right
to
our
court
of
appeals.
and
each
one
of
these
cases
counsel
is
appointed
and
each
one
of
these
a
full
record
is
prepared
and
each
one
of
these
cases
a
full
brief
is
prepared,
oral
arguments
are
had
and
an
appeal
is
filed
by
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
supreme
court
as
the
case
maybe.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
what
i
meant
your
honor.
we
have
a
full
appellate
system
and
there
is
full
record
file,
briefing
oral
argument
and
at
the
conclusion
the
applicable
court
as
the
court
of
appeals
or
supreme
court
files
its
written
opinion.
so
the
first
question
we
are
confronted
with
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor
that
is
one
of
the
two
instances.
one,
a
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals
permits
an
automatic
appeal.
two
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
of
right,
and
two
if
there
is
a
substantial
question
presented
under
either
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
or
at
least
state
of
north
carolina.
these
are
the
two
instances
in
which
there
is
an
appeal
as
right
of
and
all
other
instances,
the
appeal
is
purely
discretionary
by
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
must
admit
your
honor,
i
never
even
thought
about
that
question,
the
north
carolina
because,
we
once
heard
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
must
admit
that
--
we
never
--
i
never
thought
about
that
in
north
carolina,
all
my
discussions
with
the
members
of
the
courts
never
really
raised
that
question.
now
of
course,
the
moffitt
case
goes
beyond
that
so
moffitt
says
that
the
issue
reserved
in
douglas
requires
as
a
matter
of
right
that
counsel
be
appointed
in
all
cases
from
the
court
of
appeals
to
seek
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
in
north
carolina.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no
your
honor,
i
don’t
believe
so
at
all.
i
have
that
discussed
in
our
brief
and
i
believe
it
is
conceded
by
the
court
of
appeals
--
by
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
there
are
no
questions.
there
was
no
dissent
and
no
substantial
constitutional
question
involved.
now
the
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that
of
course
your
honor
makes
the
distinction
whether
or
not
it
is
on
appeal
as
of
right
which
would
require
a
full
briefing
or
a
certiorari
which
can
be
summarily
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
we
have
no
guidelines
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
if
the
court
upon
the
review
of
petition
determines
that
it
is
a
matter
of
right,
then
of
course
counsel
is
appointed
for
full
briefing
and
oral
argument.
i
have
to
admit
i
don’t
believe
we
have
any
firm
guidelines.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
there
is
none
your
honor.
the
only
certification
that
truly
exist
is
the
certification
based
upon
a
dissent
which
triggers
the
appeal
as
of
right.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor
this
is
the
typical
catechism
of
these
cases.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
in
fact
in
the
case
from
guilford
county
in
which
was
mr.
moffitt
was
represented
by
the
public
defender
at
trial
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court,
you
will
find
that
that
is
the
note
appended
to
the
supreme
court's
denial
of
cert
that
there
is
no
substantial
constitutional
question
involved
in
petition
and
the
purported
appeal
is
denied.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
by
the
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
criteria
for
certiorari
is
also
scheduled
in
our
brief
and
the
situation
there
is
whether
or
not
it
appears
to
be
in
conflict
with
an
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
or
whether
or
not
it’s
an
issue
of
statewide
importance.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
big
same
criteria
which
this
court
uses
in
making
its
determinations
of
whether
or
not
to
grant
certiorari.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
or
he
will
file
both
and
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
quite
often
we
--
the
attorney
will
file
both
the
petition
claiming
--
seeking
discretionary
review
and
appeal
claiming
it
as
of
right
and
we
have
to
respond
to
both.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
whether
or
not
to
grant
certiorari
is
determining
conference
and
the
number
of
justices
of
the
seven
who
would
have
to
vote
on
it
is
a
number
unaware
and
i
don’t
believe
it’s
ever
been
released
outside
of
the
doors
of
the
conference
room.
perhaps
if
we
inquire
we
might
be
told
that
it
is
not
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
at
all.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
that
is
determined
by
the
court
in
conference
your
honor
but
i
just
cannot
respond
to
the
number
of
the
seven
justices
who
are
required
to
vote
to
bring
up
certiorari.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
if
the
court
determines
that
it
is
a
substantial
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
up
till
now
there
has
been
confusion
in
the
matter
your
honor.
the
trial
judges
have
been
unable
to
really
determine
what
our
statute
meant
and
the
administrative
office
of
the
courts
had
not
provided
them
with
guidelines.
so,
determination
were
made
on
an
adhoc
basis
to
find
a
schedule
of
all
the
petitions,
they
are
listed
in
the
front
of
each
volume
of
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
and
supreme
court.
all
the
petitions
are
scheduled
and
it’s
a
good
number
of
petitions
which
are
scheduled
there.
now,
we
go
beyond
the
state
question
because
the
fourth
circuit
then
held
that
there
is
also
a
constitutional
right
to
the
appointment
of
counsel
to
come
from
the
highest
state
court
in
which
review
maybe
had
to
this
honorable
court
and
that
this
too
is
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact
that
is
the
very
case,
the
moffitt
case
from
guilford
county
he
was
represented
by
counsel
to
the
supreme
court
by
public
defender
and
counsel
was
not
then
provided.
oh,
excuse
me,
and
in
that
case
the
supreme
court
entered
an
order
that
there
was
no
substantial
constitutional
question.
and
in
that
case
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
he
was
denied
his
right
to
counsel
to
seek
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
from
that
to
congress
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh,
none
at
all
but
the
fourth
circuit
found
that
this
is
a
constitutional
right
and
i
think
taking
a
simplistic
approach
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
the
jurisdictional
statutes
your
honor
which
established
reviewed
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
i
believe
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
certiorari
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
your
honor.
and
so,
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor.
there
is
no
oral
argument.
the
oral
argument
is
had
once
certiorari
is
granted.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
exactly
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
we
have
no
oral
argument
in
the
supreme
court
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
the
only
precedent
your
honor
would
be
an
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
so
it
is
going
to
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
have
never
heard
that
your
honor.
i
have
never
heard
that
argued
in
that
regard.
now,
we
go
of
course,
on
this
question
to
this
court
and
i
would
submit
that
the
analogy
--
the
easy
analogy
drawn
between
virginia
practice
and
north
carolina
practice
fails
upon
an
analysis.
i
would
further
argue
this
that
all
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
up
till
now
have
not
automatically
and
directly
gone
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
in
kirby
case,
this
court
held
that
the
right
to
counsel
at
a
free
indictment
lineup
wasn’t
constitutionally
required
because
a
free
indictment
lineup
was
not
a
critical
stage
to
the
proceeding.
similarly
in
the
simons
case,
this
court
held
that
counsel
was
not
required
of
photographic
lineup
because
a
photographic
lineup
was
not
a
critical
stage
in
the
proceeding.
what
we
have
here
the
fourth
circuit
has
now
characterized
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
as
a
critical
state
because
i
would
argue
that
the
predicate
upon
which
the
right
to
counsel
is
based
is
a
previous
determination
that
this
is
a
critical
stage
proceeding.
and
i
believe
that
is
not
possible
to
characterize
a
discretionary
review
by
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
as
a
critical
stage
that
discretionary
review
and
critical
stage
are
words
which
are
not
compatible.
to
further
characterize
why
it
is
not
a
critical
stage,
the
denial
of
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
by
this
court
has
always
been
stated
not
to
be
of
any
significance
by
this
court.
furthermore
the
seeking
of
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
is
not
a
necessary
prerequisite
to
the
exhaustion
of
available
state
remedies
as
a
prerequisite
to
going
to
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
to
the
litigant
yes
your
honor
but
to
the
criminal
defendant
i
don’t
believe
it’s
of
any
significance
because
the
denial
of
cert
is
of
no
significance.
failing
to
seek
certiorari
is
of
no
significance
because
the
criminal
defendant
can
immediately
go
into
federal
habeas
corpus
or
into
state
post
conviction.
we
have
a
very
complete
state
post
conviction
remedy
in
north
carolina
with
the
appointment
of
counsel,
with
the
appointment
of
counsel
to
seek
certiorari
from
our
court
of
appeal
which
reviews
post
conviction
matters.
and
though
review
can
also
be
had
of
constitutional
questions
by
one,
state
post
conviction
matters
where
there
is
counsel
as
of
right.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
we
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
we
have
a
case
state
versus
white
which
says
we
do
not
but
as
a
practical
matter
most
superior
court
judges
will
review
the
questions.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes
your
honor,
but
then
again
we
have
the
complete
federal
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
there
would
be
no
--
the
federal
court
judges
would
not
require
that
for
exhaustion,
if
the
issue
has
been
raised
and
decided.
but,
there
is
a
complete
federal
remedy
by
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
there
is
not
preclusion
from
seeking
this
remedy
by
the
failure
to
seek
certiorari.
and
i
would
argue
this
that
more
complete
review
can
be
had
at
the
record
in
the
case
in
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
court
in
which
the
judge
reads
that
entire
record
and
which
in
opinion
is
written
in
each
and
every
case
then
can
be
had
by
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court.
i
don’t
mean
to
say
anything
which
might
sound
slanderous
but
the
orders
of
the
district
court
which
review
the
contentions
in
detail
are
more
meaningful
than
the
denial
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
by
this
court
as
this
court
is
aware.
the
last
figures
i
saw
was
3.3%
of
all
petitions
for
writ
of
certiorari,
filed
a
form
of
apropos
granted.
statements
of
this
court
have
said
that
96%
of
such
petitions
are
frivolous.
now,
if
we
are
going
to
say
the
counsel
is
required
what
we
are
doing
first
of
all
is
turning
the
pyramid
which
has
been
accepted
in
the
past
cases
funneling
up,
filtering
up
to
this
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
up
until
now
historically
we
have
considered
the
appellate
system,
a
filtering
system
and
the
figures,
i
have
seen
approximately
70
cases
per
week
are
filed
here
about
4500
a
year.
and
the
case
is
filtered
up.
now,
if
we
were
to
follow
the
fourth
circuit
reasoning
that
the
appointment
of
counsel
is
constitutionally
required
in
each
and
every
case
to
seek
certiorari
from
this
court,
we
take
that
judicial
pyramid,
we
open
it
wide
and
we
turn
it
more
into
a
flood
pipe
where
this
court
will
then
become
the
ultimate
reviewer
of
each
and
every
conviction
affirmed
in
the
appellate
courts
of
united
states.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
but
the
fourth
circuit
has
said
your
honor
that
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
the
appointment
of
counsel
to
seek
certiorari
from
this
court
and
so
if
you
have
a
constitutional
right
just
like
the
other
constitutional
rights
where
you
have
a
right
to
counsel.
you
have
that
right
unless
you
freely
understandably,
and
voluntarily
waive
it.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
part
of
it
but
i
have
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i’m
arguing
your
honor
that
the
factor
by
which
cases
--
filings
are
multiplying
this
court
would
probably
be
in
the
nature
of
three
to
four
within
the
next
two
terms.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
of
course
your
honor,
this
case
had
never
come
true
that
procedure.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
of
course
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
fourth
circuit
has
disregarded
questions
of
state
law.
we
don’t
have
state
law
of
questions
here.
the
fourth
circuit
disregarded
that
and
went
direct
to
the
federal
constitutional
issue
and
determine
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right,
the
appointment
of
counsel
is
mandated.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor
please,
we
have
a
multi-tiered
system.
now,
the
very
idea
of
establishing
our
court
of
appeals
in
1968
was
to
take
the
work
load
off
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
to
permit
it
to
have
discretionary
review
and
not
be
bogged
down
to
review
each
and
every
conviction.
now,
to
follow
through
with
your
honor’s
suggestion
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
is
back
where
it
was.
it
now
is
burdened
to
review
each
and
every
conviction.
we
might
as
well
do
away
with
our
court
of
appeal
because
they
won’t
really
serve
a
function
and
that
was
the
idea
when
we
established
the
court
of
appeals,
appeal
of
right
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
in
the
first
instance
prior
to
the
change,
our
supreme
court
did
have
as
a
matter
of
right
--
were
all
appeals
were
as
a
matter
of
right
to
our
supreme
court
and
they
were
totally
overworked.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
exactly
your
honor.
the
idea
was
to
give
the
court
discretionary
review
and
remove
the
requirement
that
the
justices
of
the
supreme
court
who
are
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor
when
i
was
answering
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
i
don’t
think
i
was
answering
that
question.
of
course
anytime
that
there
is
an
additional
work
load,
it
diminishes
the
time
available
by
an
appellate
court
to
do
other
matters
were
this
court
to
hold
here
that
counsel
has
constitutionally
required
from
the
highest
state
appellate
courts
to
this
court
and
of
the
filings
increased,
what
would
probably
be
a
geometric
rate.
i
would
submit
that
the
justices
of
this
court
would
have
less
time
to
consider
the
matters
which
they
believe
to
be
of
real
merit
and
would
probably
so
super
saturate
the
functioning
of
this
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
that’s
what
fourth
circuit
says.
that’s
what
the
fourth
circuit
said.
now,
there
is
another
point
i
would
like
to
make.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
let
us
say
this.
they
did
not
say
in
so
many
words
but
they
said
the
state
has
to
appoint
and
if
the
state
must
appoint.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact
this
year,
our
general
assembly
led
--
has
appropriated
$3,230,000.00
the
appointment
of
counsel
for
indigent
defendants
and
i
would
submit
that
a
figure
in
excess
of
three
and
one
quarter
million
dollars
for
one
year
certainly
illustrates
our
good
faith.
in
closing
because
i
see
my
time
is
short.
i
would
like
to
say
this,
that
the
fourth
circuit
has
directed
the
issuance
of
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
this
case
to
secure
moffitt’s
release
from
custody
because
the
fourth
circuit
found
that
his
constitutional
right
to
the
appointment
of
counsel
has
in
fact
been
violated.
now,
if
this
were
to
retroactively
applied
and
counsel
have
been
pointed
and
so
real
cases,
we
would
be
opening
wide
the
doors
of
most
penitentiaries
because
the
states
have
not
appointed
counsel
to
seek
review
on
this
court.
additionally,
i
would
point
out
this
that
there
would
be
a
flood
type
of
post
conviction
hearings
and
a
flood
type
of
federal
habeas
corpus
hearings
to
determine
whether
or
not
any
question
which
might
have
been
reviewed
in
this
court
was
presented.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
it
was
stayed
by
the
fourth
circuit
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
and
so
your
honor,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
fourth
circuit’s
determination
in
this
case
is
not
founded
in
law
nor
required
by
the
constitution.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
if
your
honor
please.
in
my
representation,
i
did
not
reach
the
question
of
our
state
statute
which
i
did
say
was
in
the
state
of
confusion.
our
general
assembly
just
adjourned
last
week
and
in
the
dying
hours
of
the
1974
general
assembly
they
pass
a
bill
amending
the
provision
which
mr.
anderson
spoke
to.
that
particular
provision
now
reads
review
of
any
judgment
or
decree
pursuant
to
gs78-27
that
is
direct
review
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
direct
review
to
supreme
court
in
applicable
case.
gs78-30-1
that
is
the
substantial
constitutional
questions
from
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
supreme
court,
gs78-30(2)
that
is
the
dissent
case
and
gs15-222
that
is
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
post
conviction.
so,
the
language
which
was
causing
the
trouble
and
which
the
justices
or
the
judges
or
superior
court
had
difficulty
in
applying
has
been
rewritten
and
our
statute
now
reads
that
the
right
to
counsel
in
these
instances
is
counsel
to
the
supreme
court
or
court
of
appeals
when
it
is
as
of
right
and
in
post
conviction
matters.
so
it’s
a
clear
cut
constitutional
question
without
any
state
statute
being
involved.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
under
the
criminal
justice
act.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
my
experience
your
honor
in
several
hundred
cases
in
the
fourth
circuit
has
been
--
that
counsel
is
only
appointed
upon
the
issuance
of
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
by
the
circuit
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
counsel
is
not
appointed
to
seek
the
appeal
to
the
circuit
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
rarely,
it’s
been
my
experience
that
most
certificates
of
probable
cause
are
granted
proceeds.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor
the
criminal
justice
act
is
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
i
don’t
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
don’t
believe
it
reaches
this
and
i
like
to
point
this
one
like
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
moffitt
case
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
rule
announced
in
moffitt
has
no
application
to
collateral
attack.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
in
north
carolina
your
honor?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
one
court
with
three
panels.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
the
general
assembly
has
established
a
public
defender
system
experimentally
in
three
counties
at
the
present
time.
each
time
the
general
assembly
meets
they
keep
adding
a
county
and
no
doubt
within
several
years,
the
entire
state
except
for
some
purely
rural
areas
which
could
not
really
support
it
will
probably
have
public
defender
system.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
let
me
just
say
this,
i
received
a
phone
call
from
one
of
our
public
defenders
about
two
weeks.
an
order
had
been
entered
requiring
him
to
petition
this
court
and
he
said,
“what
am
i
suppose
to
do?”
there
are
no
constitutional
issues
involved
but
an
order
has
been
entered
by
state
a
state
superior
court
judge
from
a
reading
of
the
oral
statute
and
i
said
read
anders
versus
california
but
it’s
very
difficult.
if
it’s
a
constitutional
right
then
counsel
cannot
disregard
the
right
and
if
he
makes
his
determination,
he
is
in
post
conviction
as
the
defendant
in
the
next
case.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
thank
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
the
court
upon
a
petition
for
the
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
to
review
that
question
reserved
by
this
court
in
its
opinion
in
douglas
versus
california.
that
is
whether
or
not
the
constitution
mandates
the
requirement
of
counsel
to
be
appointed
for
indigent
defendants
to
seek
discretionary
review.
that
is
discretionary
review
from
the
highest
court
of
a
state
to
this
court
and
to
the
highest
court
of
a
state
in
those
states
which
have
multi-tiered
appellate
systems.
in
the
consolidated
moffitt
cases
the
fourth
circuit
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
issue
reserved
in
douglas
should
be
answered
in
the
affirmative.
although
all
courts
which
had
reviewed
the
question
prior
to
moffitt
had
answered
this
question
in
the
negative.
the
fourth
circuit
drew
an
analogy
between
the
north
carolina
appellate
system
and
the
virginia
appellate
system
and
by
joining
this
analogy
found
the
north
carolina
system
to
be
inadequate.
we
argue
that
this
analogy
is
itself
faulty.
in
the
state
of
virginia
there
is
no
appeal
as
of
right.
all
review
in
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
is
by
writ
of
error
to
this
supreme
court
of
virginia
and
counsel
is
appointed
until
by
the
fourth
circuit
and
to
represent
all
petitioners
seeking
a
writ
of
error
to
this
supreme
court
of
virginia.
and
that
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
accepts
enough
cases
to
keep
the
law
of
the
commonwealth
of
virginia
current.
in
north
carolina
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
not
at
all
your
honor
and
nor
is
there
are
any
appeals
as
a
right
in
virginia.
now,
that
is
the
virginia
system.
counsel
is
appointed
to
seek
the
writ
of
error
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh,
yes
your
honor.
we
are
talking
about
criminal
matters
here.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
and
i
am
advised
that
in
the
state
of
virginia
the
writ
of
error
if
it’s
denied
is
summarily
denied.
there
is
no
briefing,
there
is
no
opinion.
now,
in
this
state
of
north
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
really
can’t
speak
for
state
of
virginia
your
honor,
i’m
told
that
it
is
possible
and
this
is
going
to
the
fourth
circuit
that
oral
argument
can
be
had
by
the
attorney
for
the
petitioner
in
support
of
his
petition
but
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
have
to
plead
on
that
fact
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
okay,
in
north
carolina
we
have
a
multi-tiered
system.
we
have
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
and
we
have
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
appeal
is
as
a
right
from
the
trial
courts
to
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
except
in
a
case
in
which
a
sentence
is
death
or
life
imprisonment
and
in
that
case
the
appeal
is
a
right
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
direct
appeal
as
a
right
if
the
sentence
is
death
or
life
imprisonment
due
bypass
the
court
of
appeals
and
go
to
the
supreme
court.
all
other
cases
appeal
is
as
of
right
to
our
court
of
appeals.
and
each
one
of
these
cases
counsel
is
appointed
and
each
one
of
these
a
full
record
is
prepared
and
each
one
of
these
cases
a
full
brief
is
prepared,
oral
arguments
are
had
and
an
appeal
is
filed
by
the
court
of
appeals
or
the
supreme
court
as
the
case
maybe.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
what
i
meant
your
honor.
we
have
a
full
appellate
system
and
there
is
full
record
file,
briefing
oral
argument
and
at
the
conclusion
the
applicable
court
as
the
court
of
appeals
or
supreme
court
files
its
written
opinion.
so
the
first
question
we
are
confronted
with
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor
that
is
one
of
the
two
instances.
one,
a
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals
permits
an
automatic
appeal.
two
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
of
right,
and
two
if
there
is
a
substantial
question
presented
under
either
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
or
at
least
state
of
north
carolina.
these
are
the
two
instances
in
which
there
is
an
appeal
as
right
of
and
all
other
instances,
the
appeal
is
purely
discretionary
by
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
must
admit
your
honor,
i
never
even
thought
about
that
question,
the
north
carolina
because,
we
once
heard
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
must
admit
that
--
we
never
--
i
never
thought
about
that
in
north
carolina,
all
my
discussions
with
the
members
of
the
courts
never
really
raised
that
question.
now
of
course,
the
moffitt
case
goes
beyond
that
so
moffitt
says
that
the
issue
reserved
in
douglas
requires
as
a
matter
of
right
that
counsel
be
appointed
in
all
cases
from
the
court
of
appeals
to
seek
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
in
north
carolina.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no
your
honor,
i
don’t
believe
so
at
all.
i
have
that
discussed
in
our
brief
and
i
believe
it
is
conceded
by
the
court
of
appeals
--
by
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
that
there
are
no
questions.
there
was
no
dissent
and
no
substantial
constitutional
question
involved.
now
the
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
that
of
course
your
honor
makes
the
distinction
whether
or
not
it
is
on
appeal
as
of
right
which
would
require
a
full
briefing
or
a
certiorari
which
can
be
summarily
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
we
have
no
guidelines
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
if
the
court
upon
the
review
of
petition
determines
that
it
is
a
matter
of
right,
then
of
course
counsel
is
appointed
for
full
briefing
and
oral
argument.
i
have
to
admit
i
don’t
believe
we
have
any
firm
guidelines.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
there
is
none
your
honor.
the
only
certification
that
truly
exist
is
the
certification
based
upon
a
dissent
which
triggers
the
appeal
as
of
right.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor
this
is
the
typical
catechism
of
these
cases.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
in
fact
in
the
case
from
guilford
county
in
which
was
mr.
moffitt
was
represented
by
the
public
defender
at
trial
on
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court,
you
will
find
that
that
is
the
note
appended
to
the
supreme
court's
denial
of
cert
that
there
is
no
substantial
constitutional
question
involved
in
petition
and
the
purported
appeal
is
denied.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
by
the
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
criteria
for
certiorari
is
also
scheduled
in
our
brief
and
the
situation
there
is
whether
or
not
it
appears
to
be
in
conflict
with
an
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
or
whether
or
not
it’s
an
issue
of
statewide
importance.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
big
same
criteria
which
this
court
uses
in
making
its
determinations
of
whether
or
not
to
grant
certiorari.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
or
he
will
file
both
and
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
quite
often
we
--
the
attorney
will
file
both
the
petition
claiming
--
seeking
discretionary
review
and
appeal
claiming
it
as
of
right
and
we
have
to
respond
to
both.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
whether
or
not
to
grant
certiorari
is
determining
conference
and
the
number
of
justices
of
the
seven
who
would
have
to
vote
on
it
is
a
number
unaware
and
i
don’t
believe
it’s
ever
been
released
outside
of
the
doors
of
the
conference
room.
perhaps
if
we
inquire
we
might
be
told
that
it
is
not
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
at
all.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
that
is
determined
by
the
court
in
conference
your
honor
but
i
just
cannot
respond
to
the
number
of
the
seven
justices
who
are
required
to
vote
to
bring
up
certiorari.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
if
the
court
determines
that
it
is
a
substantial
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
up
till
now
there
has
been
confusion
in
the
matter
your
honor.
the
trial
judges
have
been
unable
to
really
determine
what
our
statute
meant
and
the
administrative
office
of
the
courts
had
not
provided
them
with
guidelines.
so,
determination
were
made
on
an
adhoc
basis
to
find
a
schedule
of
all
the
petitions,
they
are
listed
in
the
front
of
each
volume
of
the
north
carolina
court
of
appeals
and
supreme
court.
all
the
petitions
are
scheduled
and
it’s
a
good
number
of
petitions
which
are
scheduled
there.
now,
we
go
beyond
the
state
question
because
the
fourth
circuit
then
held
that
there
is
also
a
constitutional
right
to
the
appointment
of
counsel
to
come
from
the
highest
state
court
in
which
review
maybe
had
to
this
honorable
court
and
that
this
too
is
a
constitutional
right.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact
that
is
the
very
case,
the
moffitt
case
from
guilford
county
he
was
represented
by
counsel
to
the
supreme
court
by
public
defender
and
counsel
was
not
then
provided.
oh,
excuse
me,
and
in
that
case
the
supreme
court
entered
an
order
that
there
was
no
substantial
constitutional
question.
and
in
that
case
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
he
was
denied
his
right
to
counsel
to
seek
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
from
that
to
congress
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
oh,
none
at
all
but
the
fourth
circuit
found
that
this
is
a
constitutional
right
and
i
think
taking
a
simplistic
approach
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
the
jurisdictional
statutes
your
honor
which
established
reviewed
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
i
believe
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
certiorari
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
your
honor.
and
so,
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
your
honor.
there
is
no
oral
argument.
the
oral
argument
is
had
once
certiorari
is
granted.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
exactly
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
we
have
no
oral
argument
in
the
supreme
court
on
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
the
only
precedent
your
honor
would
be
an
exhaustion
of
state
remedies
so
it
is
going
to
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
have
never
heard
that
your
honor.
i
have
never
heard
that
argued
in
that
regard.
now,
we
go
of
course,
on
this
question
to
this
court
and
i
would
submit
that
the
analogy
--
the
easy
analogy
drawn
between
virginia
practice
and
north
carolina
practice
fails
upon
an
analysis.
i
would
further
argue
this
that
all
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
up
till
now
have
not
automatically
and
directly
gone
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
in
kirby
case,
this
court
held
that
the
right
to
counsel
at
a
free
indictment
lineup
wasn’t
constitutionally
required
because
a
free
indictment
lineup
was
not
a
critical
stage
to
the
proceeding.
similarly
in
the
simons
case,
this
court
held
that
counsel
was
not
required
of
photographic
lineup
because
a
photographic
lineup
was
not
a
critical
stage
in
the
proceeding.
what
we
have
here
the
fourth
circuit
has
now
characterized
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
as
a
critical
state
because
i
would
argue
that
the
predicate
upon
which
the
right
to
counsel
is
based
is
a
previous
determination
that
this
is
a
critical
stage
proceeding.
and
i
believe
that
is
not
possible
to
characterize
a
discretionary
review
by
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
as
a
critical
stage
that
discretionary
review
and
critical
stage
are
words
which
are
not
compatible.
to
further
characterize
why
it
is
not
a
critical
stage,
the
denial
of
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
by
this
court
has
always
been
stated
not
to
be
of
any
significance
by
this
court.
furthermore
the
seeking
of
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
is
not
a
necessary
prerequisite
to
the
exhaustion
of
available
state
remedies
as
a
prerequisite
to
going
to
federal
habeas
corpus.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
to
the
litigant
yes
your
honor
but
to
the
criminal
defendant
i
don’t
believe
it’s
of
any
significance
because
the
denial
of
cert
is
of
no
significance.
failing
to
seek
certiorari
is
of
no
significance
because
the
criminal
defendant
can
immediately
go
into
federal
habeas
corpus
or
into
state
post
conviction.
we
have
a
very
complete
state
post
conviction
remedy
in
north
carolina
with
the
appointment
of
counsel,
with
the
appointment
of
counsel
to
seek
certiorari
from
our
court
of
appeal
which
reviews
post
conviction
matters.
and
though
review
can
also
be
had
of
constitutional
questions
by
one,
state
post
conviction
matters
where
there
is
counsel
as
of
right.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor,
we
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
we
have
a
case
state
versus
white
which
says
we
do
not
but
as
a
practical
matter
most
superior
court
judges
will
review
the
questions.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes
your
honor,
but
then
again
we
have
the
complete
federal
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
there
would
be
no
--
the
federal
court
judges
would
not
require
that
for
exhaustion,
if
the
issue
has
been
raised
and
decided.
but,
there
is
a
complete
federal
remedy
by
writ
of
habeas
corpus
and
there
is
not
preclusion
from
seeking
this
remedy
by
the
failure
to
seek
certiorari.
and
i
would
argue
this
that
more
complete
review
can
be
had
at
the
record
in
the
case
in
a
petition
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
court
in
which
the
judge
reads
that
entire
record
and
which
in
opinion
is
written
in
each
and
every
case
then
can
be
had
by
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court.
i
don’t
mean
to
say
anything
which
might
sound
slanderous
but
the
orders
of
the
district
court
which
review
the
contentions
in
detail
are
more
meaningful
than
the
denial
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
by
this
court
as
this
court
is
aware.
the
last
figures
i
saw
was
3.3%
of
all
petitions
for
writ
of
certiorari,
filed
a
form
of
apropos
granted.
statements
of
this
court
have
said
that
96%
of
such
petitions
are
frivolous.
now,
if
we
are
going
to
say
the
counsel
is
required
what
we
are
doing
first
of
all
is
turning
the
pyramid
which
has
been
accepted
in
the
past
cases
funneling
up,
filtering
up
to
this
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
up
until
now
historically
we
have
considered
the
appellate
system,
a
filtering
system
and
the
figures,
i
have
seen
approximately
70
cases
per
week
are
filed
here
about
4500
a
year.
and
the
case
is
filtered
up.
now,
if
we
were
to
follow
the
fourth
circuit
reasoning
that
the
appointment
of
counsel
is
constitutionally
required
in
each
and
every
case
to
seek
certiorari
from
this
court,
we
take
that
judicial
pyramid,
we
open
it
wide
and
we
turn
it
more
into
a
flood
pipe
where
this
court
will
then
become
the
ultimate
reviewer
of
each
and
every
conviction
affirmed
in
the
appellate
courts
of
united
states.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
but
the
fourth
circuit
has
said
your
honor
that
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
the
appointment
of
counsel
to
seek
certiorari
from
this
court
and
so
if
you
have
a
constitutional
right
just
like
the
other
constitutional
rights
where
you
have
a
right
to
counsel.
you
have
that
right
unless
you
freely
understandably,
and
voluntarily
waive
it.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
no,
part
of
it
but
i
have
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i’m
arguing
your
honor
that
the
factor
by
which
cases
--
filings
are
multiplying
this
court
would
probably
be
in
the
nature
of
three
to
four
within
the
next
two
terms.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
of
course
your
honor,
this
case
had
never
come
true
that
procedure.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
of
course
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
fourth
circuit
has
disregarded
questions
of
state
law.
we
don’t
have
state
law
of
questions
here.
the
fourth
circuit
disregarded
that
and
went
direct
to
the
federal
constitutional
issue
and
determine
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right,
the
appointment
of
counsel
is
mandated.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor
please,
we
have
a
multi-tiered
system.
now,
the
very
idea
of
establishing
our
court
of
appeals
in
1968
was
to
take
the
work
load
off
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
to
permit
it
to
have
discretionary
review
and
not
be
bogged
down
to
review
each
and
every
conviction.
now,
to
follow
through
with
your
honor’s
suggestion
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
is
back
where
it
was.
it
now
is
burdened
to
review
each
and
every
conviction.
we
might
as
well
do
away
with
our
court
of
appeal
because
they
won’t
really
serve
a
function
and
that
was
the
idea
when
we
established
the
court
of
appeals,
appeal
of
right
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
in
the
first
instance
prior
to
the
change,
our
supreme
court
did
have
as
a
matter
of
right
--
were
all
appeals
were
as
a
matter
of
right
to
our
supreme
court
and
they
were
totally
overworked.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
exactly
your
honor.
the
idea
was
to
give
the
court
discretionary
review
and
remove
the
requirement
that
the
justices
of
the
supreme
court
who
are
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor
when
i
was
answering
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
i
don’t
think
i
was
answering
that
question.
of
course
anytime
that
there
is
an
additional
work
load,
it
diminishes
the
time
available
by
an
appellate
court
to
do
other
matters
were
this
court
to
hold
here
that
counsel
has
constitutionally
required
from
the
highest
state
appellate
courts
to
this
court
and
of
the
filings
increased,
what
would
probably
be
a
geometric
rate.
i
would
submit
that
the
justices
of
this
court
would
have
less
time
to
consider
the
matters
which
they
believe
to
be
of
real
merit
and
would
probably
so
super
saturate
the
functioning
of
this
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
that’s
what
fourth
circuit
says.
that’s
what
the
fourth
circuit
said.
now,
there
is
another
point
i
would
like
to
make.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
let
us
say
this.
they
did
not
say
in
so
many
words
but
they
said
the
state
has
to
appoint
and
if
the
state
must
appoint.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact
this
year,
our
general
assembly
led
--
has
appropriated
$3,230,000.00
the
appointment
of
counsel
for
indigent
defendants
and
i
would
submit
that
a
figure
in
excess
of
three
and
one
quarter
million
dollars
for
one
year
certainly
illustrates
our
good
faith.
in
closing
because
i
see
my
time
is
short.
i
would
like
to
say
this,
that
the
fourth
circuit
has
directed
the
issuance
of
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
this
case
to
secure
moffitt’s
release
from
custody
because
the
fourth
circuit
found
that
his
constitutional
right
to
the
appointment
of
counsel
has
in
fact
been
violated.
now,
if
this
were
to
retroactively
applied
and
counsel
have
been
pointed
and
so
real
cases,
we
would
be
opening
wide
the
doors
of
most
penitentiaries
because
the
states
have
not
appointed
counsel
to
seek
review
on
this
court.
additionally,
i
would
point
out
this
that
there
would
be
a
flood
type
of
post
conviction
hearings
and
a
flood
type
of
federal
habeas
corpus
hearings
to
determine
whether
or
not
any
question
which
might
have
been
reviewed
in
this
court
was
presented.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
it
was
stayed
by
the
fourth
circuit
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
and
so
your
honor,
it
is
our
contention
that
the
fourth
circuit’s
determination
in
this
case
is
not
founded
in
law
nor
required
by
the
constitution.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
if
your
honor
please.
in
my
representation,
i
did
not
reach
the
question
of
our
state
statute
which
i
did
say
was
in
the
state
of
confusion.
our
general
assembly
just
adjourned
last
week
and
in
the
dying
hours
of
the
1974
general
assembly
they
pass
a
bill
amending
the
provision
which
mr.
anderson
spoke
to.
that
particular
provision
now
reads
review
of
any
judgment
or
decree
pursuant
to
gs78-27
that
is
direct
review
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
direct
review
to
supreme
court
in
applicable
case.
gs78-30-1
that
is
the
substantial
constitutional
questions
from
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
supreme
court,
gs78-30(2)
that
is
the
dissent
case
and
gs15-222
that
is
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
post
conviction.
so,
the
language
which
was
causing
the
trouble
and
which
the
justices
or
the
judges
or
superior
court
had
difficulty
in
applying
has
been
rewritten
and
our
statute
now
reads
that
the
right
to
counsel
in
these
instances
is
counsel
to
the
supreme
court
or
court
of
appeals
when
it
is
as
of
right
and
in
post
conviction
matters.
so
it’s
a
clear
cut
constitutional
question
without
any
state
statute
being
involved.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
under
the
criminal
justice
act.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
my
experience
your
honor
in
several
hundred
cases
in
the
fourth
circuit
has
been
--
that
counsel
is
only
appointed
upon
the
issuance
of
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
by
the
circuit
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
counsel
is
not
appointed
to
seek
the
appeal
to
the
circuit
court.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
rarely,
it’s
been
my
experience
that
most
certificates
of
probable
cause
are
granted
proceeds.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
your
honor
the
criminal
justice
act
is
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes,
i
don’t
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
i
don’t
believe
it
reaches
this
and
i
like
to
point
this
one
like
--
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
the
fourth
circuit
in
the
moffitt
case
made
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
rule
announced
in
moffitt
has
no
application
to
collateral
attack.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
in
north
carolina
your
honor?
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
one
court
with
three
panels.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
well,
the
general
assembly
has
established
a
public
defender
system
experimentally
in
three
counties
at
the
present
time.
each
time
the
general
assembly
meets
they
keep
adding
a
county
and
no
doubt
within
several
years,
the
entire
state
except
for
some
purely
rural
areas
which
could
not
really
support
it
will
probably
have
public
defender
system.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
yes
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
let
me
just
say
this,
i
received
a
phone
call
from
one
of
our
public
defenders
about
two
weeks.
an
order
had
been
entered
requiring
him
to
petition
this
court
and
he
said,
“what
am
i
suppose
to
do?”
there
are
no
constitutional
issues
involved
but
an
order
has
been
entered
by
state
a
state
superior
court
judge
from
a
reading
of
the
oral
statute
and
i
said
read
anders
versus
california
but
it’s
very
difficult.
if
it’s
a
constitutional
right
then
counsel
cannot
disregard
the
right
and
if
he
makes
his
determination,
he
is
in
post
conviction
as
the
defendant
in
the
next
case.
mr.
jacob
l.
safron
thank
your
honor.
