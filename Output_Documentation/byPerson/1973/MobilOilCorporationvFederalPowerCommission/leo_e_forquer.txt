mr.
leo
e.
forquer
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
first
of
all
to
take
a
little
time
to
give
a
chronological
resume
of
what
happened
in
these
cases.
it
may
duplicate
certain
things
that
have
been
said
before,
but
i
think
it
gives
a
better
perspective
on
it.
the
first
southern
louisiana
case
was
initiated
in
1961
and
was
decided
in
1968,
shortly
after
this
court’s
affirmance
of
the
commission
in
the
permian
case.
the
rates
established
in
that
proceeding
were
based
on
1960
costs
and
were
lower
than
the
guideline
and
inline
rates
which
the
commission
had
previously
established
for
southern
louisiana.
the
commission
devoted
very
little
discussion
to
the
gas
supply
situation,
but
concluded
that
its
rates
would
induce
adequate
supplies.
it
said
that
findings
to
production
and
reserves
to
production
ratios
were
not
significant
in
helping
to
determine
reasonable
rates.
among
the
many
applications
for
rehearing
presented
to
the
commission
was
one
by
the
pipeline
purchasers
group
that
indicated
they
were
having
difficulty
purchasing
sufficient
supplies
of
gas
to
meet
their
customer’s
demands
and
that
the
rates
were
inadequate
to
increase
that
supply.
while
the
commission
denied
rehearing,
it
recognized
the
inadequacy
of
the
cost
and
reserve
data,
particularly
that
with
respect
to
the
offshore
federal
domain
area
of
southern
louisiana.
accordingly,
it
lifted
the
indefinite
moratorium
that
it
had
imposed
on
price
increases
in
that
area
to
the
extent
necessary
to
permit
certain
limited
increased
rate
filings,
for
gas
sold
under
contracts
dated
after
october
1,
1968
and
it
limited
the
moratorium
on
similar
onshore
sales
to
five
years.
at
the
same
time,
it
instituted
a
new
proceeding
which
was
to
reexamine
the
rate
for
offshore
southern
louisiana,
establish
a
new
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
that
area.
this
was
the
beginning
of
south
louisiana
2,
the
case
which
is
now
before
this
court.
later
that
same
year
they
expanded
the
proceeding
so
that
it
encompassed
the
entire
area
involved
in
the
first
southern
louisiana
case.
in
september
of
1969,
before
this
case,
the
first
southern
louisiana
1
was
submitted
to
the
court
for
review.
the
staff
of
the
federal
power
commission
issued
a
report,
indicating
the
national
gas
supply
situation
had
deteriorated,
the
reserves
to
production
ratio
and
the
findings
to
production
ratios
had
declined
sharply.
they
concluded
that
unless
aggressive
action
was
taken
to
increase
the
finding
of
gas,
supplies
would
soon
not
be
adequate
to
meet
demands.
they
pointed
out
that
the
findings
in
1968
were
less
than
production
and
that
there
would
probably
be
regional
supply
deficiencies
as
early
as
1973.
they
were
much
too
optimistic
because
early
as
late
fall
of
1970,
one
or
more
pipelines
were
curtailing
supplies
of
gas
to
firm
customers.
in
its
review
of
south
louisiana
1,
the
court
below
indicated
its
misgivings
with
respect
to
the
commission’s
consideration
of
the
supply
situation
and
their
lack
of
any
attention
to
the
reserves
to
production
or
findings
to
production
ratios.
however,
they
felt
that
with
the
presently
pending
south
louisiana
proceeding,
now
before
the
commission
that
it
would
serve
little
purpose
to
remand
or
to
reverse
or
to
set
aside
the
order
which
was
before
them
since
the
same
thing
was
being
investigated.
they
said,
however
that
it’s
possible
that
the
commission
may
find
it
advisable
to
immediately
modify
its
order
or
it
might
set
aside
the
order
affirmed
here.
they
said
the
commission
has
the
power
to
take
these
actions
if
it
finds
them
appropriate.
petitions
for
rehearing
were
filed
with
the
court
and
it
was
argued
that
the
commission
had
no
authority
to
set
aside
orders
which
they
had
finally
issued.
and
the
commission
itself,
in
response
to
request
from
the
court
said
we
have
no
authority
to
make
retrospective
changes
in
rates
which
we
have
established
and
which
are
finally
affirmed
unless
this
court
tells
us
that
we
can
do
so.
and
in
its
order
on
rehearing,
the
court
made
this
and
i
wish
to
quote
this
statement,
“we
wish
to
make
crystal
clear
the
authority
of
–-
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
sir,
this
is
the
order
on
rehearing
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
page
5
of
the
brief.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
it’s
in
the
brief
that
--
page
20,
the
bottom
of
page
20
of
the
government
brief.
“we
wish
to
make
crystal
clear
the
authority
of
the
commission
in
this
case
to
reopen
any
part
of
its
order
that
circumstances
require
be
reopened.”
under
section
19
(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act,
this
court
has
broad
remedial
powers
that
in
here
in
the
court
of
equity
and
pursuant
to
our
equitable
powers,
we
make
it
part
of
the
remedy
in
this
case
with
the
authority
of
the
commission
to
reopen
any
part
of
its
orders,
including
those
affecting
revenues
from
gas
already
delivered
is
left
intact.
the
commission
can
make
retrospective
as
well
as
prospective
adjustments
in
this
if
it
finds
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
do
so.
i
might
say
that
the
rates
which
were
established
by
the
commission
in
southern
louisiana
1,
either
through
court
or
commission
stays
were
never
made
effective.
now
petitions
for
certiorari
were
filed
with
this
court
and
were
denied
in
december
of
1970
and
in
the
same
month,
the
commission
reopened
south
louisiana
1
and
consolidated
it
with
south
louisiana
2.
in
the
meantime,
pursuant
to
an
order
of
the
presiding
examiner
and
also
consistent
with
the
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
the
commission
rules,
settlement
negotiations
were
being
conducted
by
the
parties
to
this
proceeding.
i
might
point
out
that
the
commission
staff
participated
in
all
of
these
conferences,
a
member
of
the
staff
presided
at
the
conferences
and
the
staff
supported
the
settlement
which
came
before
the
commission
in
this
case.
the
commission
issued
its
opinion
and
order
in
july
of
1971
and
its
order
was
affirmed
by
the
court
below
[inaudible]
legal
issues
that
are
presented
to
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
how’s
that
your
honor?
i
am
sorry.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
the
issue
as
to
sola.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
no,
i
don’t
think
so
your
honor.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
it
is
new
york
and
mdg.
they
support
sola
i
and
say
that
the
court
had
no
authority
to
give
us
the
commission
authority
to
do
anything
about
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
against
sola
i
are
the,
all
the
people
who
joined
in
the
settlement
proposal
in
sola
ii.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
mobil,
that’
right.
well,
they
didn’t
join
it,
they
opposed
consistently
your
honor.
the
first
issue
that
--
legal
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
the
commission
did
have
authority
or
rather
whether
the
court
below
had
the
authority
to
authorize
the
commission
to
take
another
look
at
its
decision
in
the
first
southern
louisiana
case
and
make
retrospective
as
well
as
perspective
adjustments.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
indeed
it
was,
your
honor,
it
was
the
primary
issue
that
was
raised
before
the
court
at
that
time
under
the
petitions.
under
section
19
(b)
of
the
natural
gas
act,
the
court
of
appeals
of
course
has
authority
to
set
aside
an
order
in
the
whole
or
in
part
or
it
could
order
additional
evidence
to
be
heard
by
the
commission
upon
such
terms
and
conditions
as
it
deems
proper.
now
the
court
below
was
greatly
troubled
by
the
commission’s
failure
to
discuss
supply
and
demand
and
its
lack
of
concern
with
the
reserve
and
the
finding
ratios.
they
felt
that
the
decisions
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
southern
louisiana
1
should
be
made
by
the
commission
who
made
the
original
decision
because
they
have
the
data
which
indicated
what
the
supply
situation
was
and
only
they
had
the
expertise
to
evaluate
that
data
and
to
evaluate
the
impact
of
the
southern
louisiana
1
rates
on
supply.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
entirely
consistent
that
this
court’s
opinion
in
the
ford
motor
company
case,
that
courts
of
appeals
in
these
instances
are
vested
with
equity
powers
and
that,
as
the
court
said
in
that
case,
while
the
court
must
act
within
the
bounds
of
the
statute
and
without
intruding
upon
the
administrative
province,
it
may
adjust
its
relief’s
to
the
exigencies
of
the
case
in
accordance
with
equitable
principles
governing
judicial
actions.
we
think
that
is
what
the
court
below
did
in
this
case
and
gave
the
commission
the
authority
to
reopen
its
previous
order.
if
that
is
true,
the
argument
made
by
certain
of
the
petitioners,
that
the
commission
was
granting
reparations
by
its
order
in
this
case
obviously
is
not
correct.
now
the
second
legal
issue
concerns
compliance
by
the
commission
with
the
three
criteria
established
by
this
court
for
review
in
the
permian
case.
one,
did
the
commission’s
order
abuse
or
exceed
its
authority?
two,
were
each
of
the
order’s
essential
elements
supported
by
substantial
evidence?
and
three,
can
the
order
be
expected
to
maintain
financial
integrity,
attract
necessary
capital
and
fairly
compensate
investors
for
the
risks
they
have
assumed
and
yet
provide
appropriate
protection
to
the
relevant
public
interest.
now
as
had
been
the
court’s
concern
in
southern
louisiana
1,
commission’s
concern
in
southern
louisiana
2
was
directed
to
the
supply
situation
of
gas
and
the
demand
for
it.
the
commission
pointed
out
the
steady
decline
in
both
the
reserves
to
production
and
the
findings
production
ratios
and
stated
that
their
minimum
objective
in
the
case
was
to
halt
the
downward
trend
of
the
reserved
production
ratio.
they
pointed
out
that
the
estimated
demand
in
south
louisiana
would
increase
from
an
annual
figure
of
six
trillion
cubic
feet
per
year
to
nine-and-a-half
trillion
cubic
feet
in
1975.
and
in
this
connection,
this
court
said
in
permian,
we
do
not
suggest
nor
did
the
commission
that
the
commission
should
not
continuously
assess
the
level
and
success
of
exploration
or
that
the
relationship
between
the
reserves
and
production
is
not
a
useful
benchmark
of
the
industry’s
future.
now
the
commission
indicated
that
it
was
unable
to
quantify
the
volumes
of
gas
which
would
be
elicited
by
a
particular
rate.
but
they
did
find
that
there
was
a
strong
positive
relationship
between
price
and
supply
or
exploratory
effort.
they
also
pointed
out
that
capital
formation
for
gas
exploration
and
development
had
been
declining
since
1957
and
that
the
industry’s
capital
requirements
had
increased
and
that
the
cost
of
producing
gas
have
continued
to
climb.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
they
had
met
those
tests.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
that’s
right.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
well,
if
you
followed
it.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
not
in
our
view,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
i
think
that
you
should
look
at
the
general
result
of
the
commission’s
rate
order
to
find
out
that
if
the
ultimate
conclusions
the
commission
arrived
at
were
appropriate
and
reasonable,
but
not
to
weigh
the
evidence
as
the
court
of
appeals
was
required
to
do.
now
in
an
attempt
to
meet
the
problems
of
declining
supply
and
inadequate
capital
formation,
the
commission
approved
a
rate
design-formula
which
encompassed
several
facets,
all
of
which
were
directed
to
in
an
attempt
to
increase
the
supply
of
gas
available
to
the
consumers
in
this
country.
this
formula
included
base
area
rates.
it
included
fixed
and
contingent
escalations.
it
included
refund
write
off
provisions
and
each
part
of
the
rate
design
was
directed
to
the
problems
facing
the
commission.
the
rate
design
had
to
function
for
the
entire
area
and
apply
to
many
producers
in
differing
circumstances
and
the
record
show
that
the
industry
had
placed
great
reliance
and
had
expanded
internally
generated
funds
to
finance
its
exploratory
efforts.
the
basic
finding
that
the
commission
made
was
that
a
portion
of
the
funds
required
for
further
exploration
and
development
in
south
louisiana
will
be
generated
by
the
increased
cash
flow
from
the
higher
rates
for
flowing
gas
and
to
further
the
operation
of
the
contingent
escalation
provisions.
flowing
gas
resources
represent
an
important
source
of
capital
to
the
industry.
the
additional
resources
from
a
higher
new
gas
rates
and
the
escalations
allowed
will
also
contribute
to
the
total
of
needed
capital.
now
in
their
approach
to
designing
these,
the
commission
felt
that
they
could
not
and
should
not
be
restricted
to
encouraging
increased
supply
solely
by
one
method
and
that
was
by
the
area
rates
which
they
established,
particularly,
the
rates
for
new
gas.
however,
they
discussed,
as
they
had,
as
had
been
done
in
permian
the
cost
--
current
cost
data
which
was
before
the
commission
in
the
determination
of
the
new
gas
rates.
they
indicated
that
the
lack
of
precision
in
these
costs
and
the
difficulties
involved
in
making
allocation
procedures
made
it
desirable
that
they
indicate
a
range
of
costs
based
on
reliable
and
credible
data.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court,
in
a
footnote
in
the
permian
case
said
that
by
one
estimate,
the
costs
of
non-associated
gas
are
45%
separate,
31%
joint
and
24%
common.
so
they
are
great
areas
for
differences
and
judgment
with
respect
to
those.
accordingly,
they
examined
the
cost
data
and
established
what
they
considered
a
range
of
reasonable
costs
and
utilize
as
step
witness
presentation
with
that
in
that
respect
who
had
recommended
a
rate
of
25
cents
per
mcf.
in
order
to
be
assured
that
there
would
be
enough
in
this
to
encourage
additional
supplies,
the
commission
indicated
that
the
rates
for
--
the
cost
for
least
acquisition
and
for
drilling
were
all
going
up
and
they
should
be
increased
slightly.
they
approved
a
rate
as
found
just
and
reasonable
for
26
cents
and
said
it
should
operate
to
elicit
additional
supplies
of
gas.
it
used
a
similar
method
for
flowing
gas
to
that
which
was
approved
by
this
court
in
the
permian
case.
the
only
difference
was
that
they
had
a
direct
assignment
of
exploration
development
cost
because
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
which
justified
that
use
and
it
approved
to
settlement
rate
of
22
and
38
cents.
the
commission
however,
at
the
same
time
pointed
out
that
under
this
traditional
old
gas
costing
method
that
the
exploration
and
development
allowance
too
often
indicates
the
cost
of
exploration
under
past
periods
rather
than
the
current
increased
cost
and
it
added
a
non-cost
component
to
the
old
gas
rate
to
increase
the
cash
flow
to
producers
for
an
increased
exploration
development
effort.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
it
was
a
--
the
figures,
if
i
recall
correctly
mr.
justice
brennan,
were
from
approximately
like
20
cents
to
25
cents,
24
cents
i
think
it
was.
the
rate
which
the
staff
had
developed
was
21.18
cents
and
they
increased
it
to
22.375.
now,
probably
one
of
the
things
that
has
been
most
vigorously
attacked
here
by
the
petitioners
are
the
provisions
for
refund
right
offs.
this
was
the
really
the
second
leg
of
the
commission’s
attempt
to
encourage
additional
supplies
to
south
louisiana.
the
commission
first
of
all
went
back
and
looked
at
the
rates
which
had
been
established
for
past
periods
and
established
new
rates
for
gas
delivered
under
contracts
dated
prior
to
1961
and
from
to
1965
and
from
1965
to
the
date
of
their
order,
and
established
rates
which
were
consistent
first
with
what
the
commission
had
used
in
certificating
sales
of
gas
prior
to
that
time
in
southern
louisiana
and
secondly,
their
guideline
policy

prices.
but
it
also
reflected
back
from
the
26
cents
for
a
new
gas,
a
reduction
which
was
consistent
with
the
increase
cost
of
gas
which
the
record
in
this
case
reflected.
the
determination
of
a
total
of
$150
million
of
refunds
was
obviously
in
a
sense
a
compromise
with
by
the
parties
who
had
participated
in
the
settlement
conference,
but
they
resulted
from
these
rates
which
the
commission
established.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
for
refund
purposes
your
honor
they
were
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
yes,
well
they
determine
what
the
amount
refunds
would
be.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
that’s
right,
your
honor.
now,
rather
than
have
the
cash
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
well,
what
happened
was
that
the
20.625
rate
for
the
first
period
would
generate
so
much
and
the
21
a
quarter,
the
next
period
with
so
much
and
then
the
final
period
up
to
january
1,
1971
was
placed
in
a
percentage
of
the
difference
between
the
sola
i
rates
and
sola
ii
two
rates
to
equate
to
a
$150
million.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
that’s
correct.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
well
that’s
–
that’s
the
point.
the
work
off
of
the
refunds
was
related
directly
to
the
finding
of
new
gas
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
that
is
correct.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
there’s
no
change
in
the
rate,
but
they
[voice

the
effect
i
guess
is
that
they
get
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
that’s
right.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
lower
than
they
were
or
a
higher
than
they
were?
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
that’s
right.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
i
think
that
they
do
have
authority
given
a
proper
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
well,
first
of
all
the
natural
gas
act
itself
says
that
they
may
order
refunds.
it
does
not
say
that
they
must.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
to
establish
the
refund
levels,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
well
but
they
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
staff
witness
in
the
case
suggested
that
no
refund
should
be
ordered
that
the
--
those
who
had
charged
excessive
rates
would
be
better
of
if
they
retained
these
amounts
and
therefore
had
additional

mr.
leo
e.
forquer
in
the
hugoton-anadarko
case,
your
honor,
one
of
the
commissions
area
rate
proceedings,
the
ninth
circuit
so
held.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
well,
they
did
not
require
certain
portions
of
them
to
be
paid
back.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
commission
has
a
discretion
to
do
what
is
in
the
public
interest
with
respect
to
these
refunds.
if
in
an
appropriate
case
they
would
find
that
for
instance
the
ordering
of
refunds
would
cost
such
great
damage
to
the
industry
that
the
ultimate
consumer
really
would
suffer,
i
think
that
they
have
the
authority
to
so
excuse.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
well
they
--
one
of
the
--
if
you
don’t
do
that
perhaps,
your
honor,
they
won’t
have
any
gas.
this
was
again
an
attempt
to
get
a
greater
supply
of
gas
and
under
the
refund
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
that’s
right
they
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
they
did
include
an
element
in
flowing
gas
to
encourage
additional
exploration
and
development,
but
they
did
not
want
to
rest
on
simply
the
new
gas
rate
as
the
sole
incentive
to
bringing
forth
new
supplies
of
gas.
now
in
these
$150
million
of
refunds
if
in
fact
those
owing
those
amounts
do
not
find
and
dedicate
new
supplies
of
gas,
they
must
pay
these
refunds
in
cash.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
not
the
old
amount.
indeed,
because
the
commission
said
that
the
546
opinion
of
southern
louisiana
1
had
not
given
them
a
proper
rate
of
return
or
properly
reflected
exploration
development
expenses.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
well
he
--
the
only
why
he
is
not
getting
any
additional
revenue
by
this
he
is
not
having
to
pay
out
something
that
he
might
otherwise,
but
he
has
a
very
heavy
responsibility
if
he
has
large
refunds
to
find
very
large
quantities
of
gas
and
dedicate
it
to
the
interstate
marketer,
he
who
will
have
to
pay
this.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
it
has
been
increased
to
22
and
three
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
there
is
a
small
component
in
there
for
that,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
it’s
going
to
be
escalated
once
because
of
the
increase
in
cost
that
the
commission
found
were
involved
and
then
there
are
the
contingent
escalations
to
flowing
gas
rate
in
the
event
that
additional
dedications
are
made
and
these
dedications
do
not
count
until
the
refund
requirements
are
paid
off
for
those
producers
who
were
involved
in
refunds.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
we
think
it
they
could
say
i
think
quite
properly.
we
think
it
as
much
more
in
the
public
interest
that
additional
supplies
of
gas
be
furnished
so
that
you
will
continue
to
have
gas
than
it
is
that
you
get
these
amounts
of
dollars
in
refunds
and
if
we
do
not
get
the
gas
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
but
your
honor
there
was
no
other
source
to
get
these
additional
supplies
of
gas
unless
you
are
going
to
rely
solely
on
the
rate
for
new
gas.
new
gas
wasn’t
in
existence.
you
had
to
go
back
to
be
tied
with
those
who
were
presently
in
the
business
who
presently
had
reserves,
who
presently
were
delivering
gas
to
encourage
them
to
go
forward
and
find
additional
supplies.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
well,
i
think
that
this
court
certainly
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
this
court
indicated
in
permian
that
was
entirely
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
traditional
not
in
the
utility
stands.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
not
in
the
public
utility
sense
it
certainly
was
--
is
not
traditionally
true.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
but
this
is
a
situation
wholly
different
again
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
permian
where
the
gas
producing
industry
is
entirely
different
situation
than
the
ordinary
public
utility.
one
other
item
and
the
third
leg
of
the
commission’s
attempt
to
increase
gas
supply
were
the
contingent
escalation
provisions
which
were
definitely
key
to
new
dedications
of
gas
in
southern
louisiana.
by
that
provision
if
after
refunds
have
been
paid
off
producers
dedicated
up
to
15
trillion
cubic
feet
of
gas,
there
could
be
increased
rates
as
higher
as
the
cent
and
a
half.
now,
the
refund
write-off
provisions
were
completely
taken
care
of,
the
contingent
escalations
were
completely
taken
care
of,
there
would
be
30
trillion
cubic
feet
of
gas
supplied
for
the
interstate
market.
i
would
like
to
comment
about
one
other
thing
and
that
is
the
argument
that
there
was
discrimination
as
between
producers
because
some
of
them
had
earlier
settled
their
obligations
and
would
have
much
lesser
refunds.
in
connection
for
instance
with
petitioner
mobile
oil
company,
they
made
a
settlement
in
1964
in
which
they
were
excused
from
refunds
of
approximately
$14
million
and
subsequently
when
a
moratorium
which
they
proposed
in
their
settlement
had
expired
they
chose
to
continue
with
those
rates
and
not
make
any
additional
filings.
now
these
were
management
determinations.
these
were
things
that
if
they
wanted
to
make
a
settlement
in
1964
and
get
their
$14
million
then,
if
they
chose
not
to
make
increased
rate
filings
in
which
they
were
no
moratoria,
that
was
entirely
up
to
them
and
did
not
require
this
commission
to
take
all
of
those
aspects
in
the
consideration.
but
what
they
tried
to
do
was
to
make
broad
general
rules
covering
all
of
producers
in
this
wide
area,
but
primarily
in
an
attempt
to
bring
forth
additional
supplies
of
gas.

mr.

mr.
chief

and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
first
of
all
to
take
a
little
time
to
give
a
chronological
resume
of
what
happened
in
these
cases.
it
may
duplicate
certain
things
that
have
been
said
before,
but
i
think
it
gives
a
better
perspective
on
it.
the
first
southern
louisiana
case
was
initiated
in
1961
and
was
decided
in
1968,
shortly
after
this
court’s
affirmance
of
the
commission
in
the
permian
case.
the
rates
established
in
that
proceeding
were
based
on
1960
costs
and
were
lower
than
the
guideline
and
inline
rates
which
the
commission
had
previously
established
for
southern
louisiana.
the
commission
devoted
very
little
discussion
to
the
gas
supply
situation,
but
concluded
that
its
rates
would
induce
adequate
supplies.
it
said
that
findings
to
production
and
reserves
to
production
ratios
were
not
significant
in
helping
to
determine
reasonable
rates.
among
the
many
applications
for
rehearing
presented
to
the
commission
was
one
by
the
pipeline
purchasers
group
that
indicated
they
were
having
difficulty
purchasing
sufficient
supplies
of
gas
to
meet
their
customer’s
demands
and
that
the
rates
were
inadequate
to
increase
that
supply.
while
the
commission
denied
rehearing,
it
recognized
the
inadequacy
of
the
cost
and
reserve
data,
particularly
that
with
respect
to
the
offshore
federal
domain
area
of
southern
louisiana.
accordingly,
it
lifted
the
indefinite
moratorium
that
it
had
imposed
on
price
increases
in
that
area
to
the
extent
necessary
to
permit
certain
limited
increased
rate
filings,
for
gas
sold
under
contracts
dated
after
october
1,
1968
and
it
limited
the
moratorium
on
similar
onshore
sales
to
five
years.
at
the
same
time,
it
instituted
a
new
proceeding
which
was
to
reexamine
the
rate
for
offshore
southern
louisiana,
establish
a
new
just
and
reasonable
rate
for
that
area.
this
was
the
beginning
of
south
louisiana
2,
the
case
which
is
now
before
this
court.
later
that
same
year
they
expanded
the
proceeding
so
that
it
encompassed
the
entire
area
involved
in
the
first
southern
louisiana
case.
in
september
of
1969,
before
this
case,
the
first
southern
louisiana
1
was
submitted
to
the
court
for
review.
the
staff
of
the
federal
power
commission
issued
a
report,
indicating
the
national
gas
supply
situation
had
deteriorated,
the
reserves
to
production
ratio
and
the
findings
to
production
ratios
had
declined
sharply.
they
concluded
that
unless
aggressive
action
was
taken
to
increase
the
finding
of
gas,
supplies
would
soon
not
be
adequate
to
meet
demands.
they
pointed
out
that
the
findings
in
1968
were
less
than
production
and
that
there
would
probably
be
regional
supply
deficiencies
as
early
as
1973.
they
were
much
too
optimistic
because
early
as
late
fall
of
1970,
one
or
more
pipelines
were
curtailing
supplies
of
gas
to
firm
customers.
in
its
review
of
south
louisiana
1,
the
court
below
indicated
its
misgivings
with
respect
to
the
commission’s
consideration
of
the
supply
situation
and
their
lack
of
any
attention
to
the
reserves
to
production
or
findings
to
production
ratios.
however,
they
felt
that
with
the
presently
pending
south
louisiana
proceeding,
now
before
the
commission
that
it
would
serve
little
purpose
to
remand
or
to
reverse
or
to
set
aside
the
order
which
was
before
them
since
the
same
thing
was
being
investigated.
they
said,
however
that
it’s
possible
that
the
commission
may
find
it
advisable
to
immediately
modify
its
order
or
it
might
set
aside
the
order
affirmed
here.
they
said
the
commission
has
the
power
to
take
these
actions
if
it
finds
them
appropriate.
petitions
for
rehearing
were
filed
with
the
court
and
it
was
argued
that
the
commission
had
no
authority
to
set
aside
orders
which
they
had
finally
issued.
and
the
commission
itself,
in
response
to
request
from
the
court
said
we
have
no
authority
to
make
retrospective
changes
in
rates
which
we
have
established
and
which
are
finally
affirmed
unless
this
court
tells
us
that
we
can
do
so.
and
in
its
order
on
rehearing,
the
court
made
this
and
i
wish
to
quote
this
statement,
“we
wish
to
make
crystal
clear
the
authority
of
–-
mr.
leo

“we
wish

of

under
section
19
(b)
of
the

act,
this
court
has
broad
remedial
powers
that
in
here
in
the
court
of
equity
and
pursuant
to
our
equitable
powers,
we
make
it

of
the

in
this

of
the
commission
to
reopen
any
part
of
its
orders,
including
those
affecting
revenues
from
gas
already
delivered
is
left
intact.
the
commission
can
make
retrospective
as
well
as
prospective
adjustments
in
this
if
it
finds
that
it
is
in
the
public
interest
to
do
so.
i
might
say
that
the
rates
which
were
established
by
the
commission
in
southern
louisiana
1,
either
through
court
or
commission
stays
were
never
made
effective.
now
petitions
for
certiorari
were
filed
with
this
court
and
were
denied
in
december
of
1970
and
in
the
same
month,
the
commission
reopened
south
louisiana
1
and
consolidated
it
with
south
louisiana
2.
in
the
meantime,
pursuant
to
an
order
of
the
presiding
examiner
and
also
consistent
with
the
provisions
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
and
the
commission
rules,
settlement
negotiations
were
being
conducted
by
the
parties
to
this
proceeding.
i
might
point
out
that
the
commission
staff
participated
in
all
of
these
conferences,
a
member
of
the
staff
presided
at
the
conferences
and
the
staff
supported
the
settlement
which
came
before
the
commission
in
this
case.
the
commission
issued
its
opinion
and
order
in
july
of
1971
and
its
order
was
affirmed
by
the
court

the
first
issue
that

legal
issue
before

is
whether

rather
whether

authorize
the

to
take

indeed
it
was,
your

it
was
the
primary
issue
that
was

to
set
aside
an
order
in
the
whole
or
in
part
or
it
could
order
additional
evidence
to
be
heard
by
the
commission
upon
such
terms
and
conditions
as
it
deems
proper.
now
the
court
below
was
greatly
troubled
by
the
commission’s
failure
to
discuss
supply
and
demand
and
its
lack
of
concern
with
the
reserve
and
the
finding
ratios.
they
felt
that
the
decisions
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
southern
louisiana
1
should
be
made
by
the
commission
who
made
the
original
decision
because
they
have
the
data
which
indicated
what
the
supply
situation
was
and
only
they
had
the
expertise
to
evaluate
that
data
and
to
evaluate
the
impact
of
the
southern
louisiana
1
rates
on
supply.
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
entirely
consistent
that
this
court’s
opinion
in
the
ford
motor
company
case,
that
courts
of
appeals
in
these
instances
are
vested
with
equity
powers
and
that,
as
the
court
said
in
that
case,
while
the
court
must
act
within
the
bounds
of
the
statute
and
without
intruding
upon
the
administrative
province,
it
may
adjust
its
relief’s
to
the
exigencies
of
the
case
in
accordance
with
equitable
principles
governing
judicial
actions.
we
think
that
is
what
the
court
below
did
in
this
case
and
gave
the
commission
the
authority
to
reopen
its
previous
order.
if
that
is
true,
the
argument
made
by
certain
of
the
petitioners,
that
the
commission
was
granting
reparations
by
its
order
in
this
case
obviously
is
not
correct.
now
the
second
legal
issue
concerns
compliance
by
the
commission
with
the
three
criteria
established
by
this
court
for
review
in
the
permian
case.
one,
did
the
commission’s
order
abuse
or
exceed
its
authority?
two,
were
each
of
the
order’s
essential
elements
supported
by
substantial
evidence?
and
three,
can
the
order
be
expected
to
maintain
financial
integrity,
attract
necessary
capital
and
fairly
compensate
investors
for
the
risks
they
have
assumed
and
yet
provide
appropriate
protection
to
the
relevant
public
interest.
now
as
had
been
the
court’s
concern
in
southern
louisiana
1,
commission’s
concern
in
southern
louisiana
2
was
directed
to
the
supply
situation
of
gas
and
the
demand
for
it.
the
commission
pointed
out
the
steady
decline
in
both
the
reserves
to
production
and
the
findings
production
ratios
and
stated
that
their
minimum
objective
in
the
case
was
to
halt
the
downward
trend
of
the
reserved
production
ratio.
they
pointed
out
that
the
estimated
demand
in
south
louisiana
would
increase
from
an
annual
figure
of
six
trillion
cubic
feet
per
year
to
nine-and-a-half
trillion
cubic
feet
in
1975.
and
in
this
connection,
this
court
said
in
permian,
we
do
not
suggest
nor
did
the
commission
that
the
commission
should
not
continuously
assess
the
level
and
success
of
exploration
or
that
the
relationship
between
the
reserves
and
production
is
not
a
useful
benchmark
of
the
industry’s
future.
now
the
commission
indicated
that
it
was
unable
to
quantify
the
volumes
of
gas
which
would
be
elicited
by
a
particular
rate.
but
they
did
find
that
there
was
a
strong
positive
relationship
between
price
and
supply
or
exploratory
effort.
they
also
pointed
out
that
capital
formation
for
gas
exploration
and
development
had
been
declining
since
1957
and
that
the
industry’s
capital
requirements
had
increased
and
that
the
cost
of
producing
gas
have
continued
to
climb.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
they
had
met
those
tests.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
that’s
right.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
well,
if
you
followed
it.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
not
in
our
view,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
i
think
that
you
should
look
at
the
general
result
of
the
commission’s
rate
order
to
find
out
that
if
the
ultimate
conclusions
the
commission
arrived
at
were
appropriate
and
reasonable,
but
not
to
weigh
the
evidence
as
the
court
of
appeals
was
required
to
do.
now
in
an
attempt
to
meet
the
problems
of
declining
supply
and
inadequate
capital
formation,
the
commission
approved
a
rate
design-formula
which
encompassed
several
facets,
all
of
which
were
directed
to
in
an
attempt
to
increase
the
supply
of
gas
available
to
the
consumers
in
this
country.
this
formula
included
base
area
rates.
it
included
fixed
and
contingent
escalations.
it
included
refund
write
off
provisions
and
each
part
of
the
rate
design
was
directed
to
the
problems
facing
the
commission.
the
rate
design
had
to
function
for
the
entire
area
and
apply
to
many
producers
in
differing
circumstances
and
the
record
show
that
the
industry
had
placed
great
reliance
and
had
expanded
internally
generated
funds
to
finance
its
exploratory
efforts.
the
basic
finding
that
the
commission
made
was
that
a
portion
of
the
funds
required
for
further
exploration
and
development
in
south
louisiana
will
be
generated
by
the
increased
cash
flow
from
the
higher
rates
for
flowing
gas
and
to
further
the
operation
of
the
contingent
escalation
provisions.
flowing
gas
resources
represent
an
important
source
of
capital
to
the
industry.
the
additional
resources
from
a
higher
new
gas
rates
and
the
escalations
allowed
will
also
contribute
to
the
total
of
needed
capital.
now
in
their
approach
to
designing
these,
the
commission
felt
that
they
could
not
and
should
not
be
restricted
to
encouraging
increased
supply
solely
by
one
method
and
that
was
by
the
area
rates
which
they
established,
particularly,
the
rates
for
new
gas.
however,
they
discussed,
as
they
had,
as
had
been
done
in
permian
the
cost
--
current
cost
data
which
was
before
the
commission
in
the
determination
of
the
new
gas
rates.
they
indicated
that
the
lack
of
precision
in
these
costs
and
the
difficulties
involved
in
making
allocation
procedures
made
it
desirable
that
they
indicate
a
range
of
costs
based
on
reliable
and
credible
data.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
this
court,
in
a
footnote
in
the
permian
case
said
that
by
one
estimate,
the
costs
of
non-associated
gas
are
45%
separate,
31%
joint
and
24%
common.
so
they
are
great
areas
for
differences
and
judgment
with
respect
to
those.
accordingly,
they
examined
the
cost
data
and
established
what
they
considered
a
range
of
reasonable
costs
and
utilize
as
step
witness
presentation
with
that
in
that
respect
who
had
recommended
a
rate
of
25
cents
per
mcf.
in
order
to
be
assured
that
there
would
be
enough
in
this
to
encourage
additional
supplies,
the
commission
indicated
that
the
rates
for
--
the
cost
for
least
acquisition
and
for
drilling
were
all
going
up
and
they
should
be
increased
slightly.
they
approved
a
rate
as
found
just
and
reasonable
for
26
cents
and
said
it
should
operate
to
elicit
additional
supplies
of
gas.
it
used
a
similar
method
for
flowing
gas
to
that
which
was
approved
by
this
court
in
the
permian
case.
the
only
difference
was
that
they
had
a
direct
assignment
of
exploration
development
cost
because
there
was
evidence
in
the
record
which
justified
that
use
and
it
approved
to
settlement
rate
of
22
and
38
cents.
the
commission
however,
at
the
same
time
pointed
out
that
under
this
traditional
old
gas
costing
method
that
the
exploration
and
development
allowance
too
often
indicates
the
cost
of
exploration
under
past
periods
rather
than
the
current
increased
cost
and
it
added
a
non-cost
component
to
the
old
gas
rate
to
increase
the
cash
flow
to
producers
for
an
increased
exploration
development
effort.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
it
was
a
--
the
figures,
if
i
recall
correctly
mr.
justice
brennan,
were
from
approximately
like
20
cents
to
25
cents,
24
cents
i
think
it
was.
the
rate
which
the
staff
had
developed
was
21.18
cents
and
they
increased
it
to
22.375.
now,
probably
one
of
the
things
that
has
been
most
vigorously
attacked
here
by
the
petitioners
are
the
provisions
for
refund
right
offs.
this
was
the
really
the
second
leg
of
the
commission’s
attempt
to
encourage
additional
supplies
to
south
louisiana.
the
commission
first
of
all
went
back
and
looked
at
the
rates
which
had
been
established
for
past
periods
and
established
new
rates
for
gas
delivered
under
contracts
dated
prior
to
1961
and
from
to
1965
and
from
1965
to
the
date
of
their
order,
and
established
rates
which
were
consistent
first
with
what
the
commission
had
used
in
certificating
sales
of
gas
prior
to
that
time
in
southern
louisiana
and
secondly,
their
guideline
policy
statement
prices.
but
it
also
reflected
back
from
the
26
cents
for
a
new
gas,
a
reduction
which
was
consistent
with
the
increase
cost
of
gas
which
the
record
in
this
case
reflected.
the
determination
of
a
total
of
$150
million
of
refunds
was
obviously
in
a
sense
a
compromise
with
by
the
parties
who
had
participated
in
the
settlement
conference,
but
they
resulted
from
these
rates
which
the
commission
established.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
for
refund
purposes
your
honor
they
were
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
yes,
well
they
determine
what
the
amount
refunds
would
be.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
that’s
right,
your
honor.
now,
rather
than
have
the
cash
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
well,
what
happened
was
that
the
20.625
rate
for
the
first
period
would
generate
so
much
and
the
21
a
quarter,
the
next
period
with
so
much
and
then
the
final
period
up
to
january
1,
1971
was
placed
in
a
percentage
of
the
difference
between
the
sola
i
rates
and
sola
ii
two
rates
to
equate
to
a
$150
million.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
that’s
correct.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
well
that’s
–
that’s
the
point.
the
work
off
of
the
refunds
was
related
directly
to
the
finding
of
new
gas
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
that
is
correct.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
there’s
no
change
in
the
rate,
but
they
[voice
overlap]
the
effect
i
guess
is
that
they
get
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
that’s
right.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
lower
than
they
were
or
a
higher
than
they
were?
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
that’s
right.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
i
think
that
they
do
have
authority
given
a
proper
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
well,
first
of
all
the
natural
gas
act
itself
says
that
they
may
order
refunds.
it
does
not
say
that
they
must.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
to
establish
the
refund
levels,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
well
but
they
--
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
staff
witness
in
the
case
suggested
that
no
refund
should
be
ordered
that
the
--
those
who
had
charged
excessive
rates
would
be
better
of
if
they
retained
these
amounts
and
therefore
had
additional
[voice
overlap]
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
in
the
hugoton-anadarko
case,
your
honor,
one
of
the
commissions
area
rate
proceedings,
the
ninth
circuit
so
held.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
well,
they
did
not
require
certain
portions
of
them
to
be
paid
back.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
commission
has
a
discretion
to
do
what
is
in
the
public
interest
with
respect
to
these
refunds.
if
in
an
appropriate
case
they
would
find
that
for
instance
the
ordering
of
refunds
would
cost
such
great
damage
to
the
industry
that
the
ultimate
consumer
really
would
suffer,
i
think
that
they
have
the
authority
to
so
excuse.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
well
they
--
one
of
the
--
if
you
don’t
do
that
perhaps,
your
honor,
they
won’t
have
any
gas.
this
was
again
an
attempt
to
get
a
greater
supply
of
gas
and
under
the
refund
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
that’s
right
they
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
they
did
include
an
element
in
flowing
gas
to
encourage
additional
exploration
and
development,
but
they
did
not
want
to
rest
on
simply
the
new
gas
rate
as
the
sole
incentive
to
bringing
forth
new
supplies
of
gas.
now
in
these
$150
million
of
refunds
if
in
fact
those
owing
those
amounts
do
not
find
and
dedicate
new
supplies
of
gas,
they
must
pay
these
refunds
in
cash.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
not
the
old
amount.
indeed,
because
the
commission
said
that
the
546
opinion
of
southern
louisiana
1
had
not
given
them
a
proper
rate
of
return
or
properly
reflected
exploration
development
expenses.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
well
he
--
the
only
why
he
is
not
getting
any
additional
revenue
by
this
he
is
not
having
to
pay
out
something
that
he
might
otherwise,
but
he
has
a
very
heavy
responsibility
if
he
has
large
refunds
to
find
very
large
quantities
of
gas
and
dedicate
it
to
the
interstate
marketer,
he
who
will
have
to
pay
this.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
it
has
been
increased
to
22
and
three
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
there
is
a
small
component
in
there
for
that,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
it’s
going
to
be
escalated
once
because
of
the
increase
in
cost
that
the
commission
found
were
involved
and
then
there
are
the
contingent
escalations
to
flowing
gas
rate
in
the
event
that
additional
dedications
are
made
and
these
dedications
do
not
count
until
the
refund
requirements
are
paid
off
for
those
producers
who
were
involved
in
refunds.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
we
think
it
they
could
say
i
think
quite
properly.
we
think
it
as
much
more
in
the
public
interest
that
additional
supplies
of
gas
be
furnished
so
that
you
will
continue
to
have
gas
than
it
is
that
you
get
these
amounts
of
dollars
in
refunds
and
if
we
do
not
get
the
gas
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
but
your
honor
there
was
no
other
source
to
get
these
additional
supplies
of
gas
unless
you
are
going
to
rely
solely
on
the
rate
for
new
gas.
new
gas
wasn’t
in
existence.
you
had
to
go
back
to
be
tied
with
those
who
were
presently
in
the
business
who
presently
had
reserves,
who
presently
were
delivering
gas
to
encourage
them
to
go
forward
and
find
additional
supplies.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
well,
i
think
that
this
court
certainly
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
this
court
indicated
in
permian
that
was
entirely
--
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
traditional
not
in
the
utility
stands.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
not
in
the
public
utility
sense
it
certainly
was
--
is
not
traditionally
true.
mr.
leo
e.
forquer
but
this
is
a
situation
wholly
different
again
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
permian
where
the
gas
producing
industry
is
entirely
different
situation
than
the
ordinary
public
utility.
one
other
item
and
the
third
leg
of
the
commission’s
attempt
to
increase
gas
supply
were
the
contingent
escalation
provisions
which
were
definitely
key
to
new
dedications
of
gas
in
southern
louisiana.
by
that
provision
if
after
refunds
have
been
paid
off
producers
dedicated
up
to
15
trillion
cubic
feet
of
gas,
there
could
be
increased
rates
as
higher
as
the
cent
and
a
half.
now,
the
refund
write-off
provisions
were
completely
taken
care
of,
the
contingent
escalations
were
completely
taken
care
of,
there
would
be
30
trillion
cubic
feet
of
gas
supplied
for
the
interstate
market.
i
would
like
to
comment
about
one
other
thing
and
that
is
the
argument
that
there
was
discrimination
as
between
producers
because
some
of
them
had
earlier
settled
their
obligations
and
would
have
much
lesser
refunds.
in
connection
for
instance
with
petitioner
mobile
oil
company,
they
made
a
settlement
in
1964
in
which
they
were
excused
from
refunds
of
approximately
$14
million
and
subsequently
when
a
moratorium
which
they
proposed
in
their
