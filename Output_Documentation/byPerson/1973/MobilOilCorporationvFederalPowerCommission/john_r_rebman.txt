mr.
john
r.
rebman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
address
my
first
and
earlier
remarks
very
briefly
to
the
argument
with
respect
to
the
question
of
the
powers
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
provide
the
commission
in
turn
with
the
power
to
set
aside
and
reconsider
the
first
southern
louisiana
decision.
and
i
want
to
call
attention
to
--
mr.
john
r.
rebman
yes,
indeed
your
honor,
that’s
quite
true.
and
your
question
ties
to
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
and
call
the
court’s
attention.
to
that
portion
of
the
fifth
circuit’s
opinion
on
appeal
on
rehearing
where
the
court
indicated
and
this
is
after
the
428
f.
2d
445,
that
their
disposition
of
the
case
was
influenced
by
the
existence
of
a
new
proceeding
which
the
commission
itself
had
already
committed
and
their
specific
statement
was
that,
in
fact
the
existence
of
the
new
proceedings
which
as
we
understand
then
will
take
into
account.
many
of
the
issues
whose
absence
has
concerned
us
here
has
been
one
of
the
factors
we
have
considered
in
deciding
to
affirm
the
commission’s
decision.
now
and
that’s
into
the
court
and
i
think
that
the
important
thing
about
this
is
to
tie
into
this
court’s
opinion
in
the
ford
motor
company
case
where
the
court
regarded
as
a
contention
without
substance
whether
the
court
below,
court
of
appeals
set
aside
the
opinion
or
whether
it
allowed
the
agency
there,
the
nlrb
to
set
aside
the
opinion.
and
the
court
characterized
the
contention
on
that
ground
as
one
without
substance.
and
this
is
a
situation
i
think
where
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
federal
power
commission
in
an
error
of
transition
because
to
read
the
two
opinions
of
the
court
--
the
commission
side
by
side
reflects
an
enormously
different
outlook
about
the
gas
supply
situation
in
this
nation.
in
the
first
opinion,
there
was
little
or
no
concern
by
commission.
in
the
second
opinion
three
years
later,
it
had
become
virtually
an
overriding
consideration.
turning
if
i
might
next
to
the
questions
with
respect
to
the
refund
discharge
and
the
questions
raised
by
you
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
it’s
very
necessary
in
looking
both
of
the
refund
discharge
and
contingent
escalation
question
to
start
at
the
beginning
of
the
book
and
not
in
the
middle
of
the
book
as
petitioners
have
done
here.
the
beginning
of
the
book
is
this
court’s
analysis
in
memphis
and
mobile
in
the
early
1960
of
the
function
of
sections
4
and
5
and
there
the
court
pointed
out
that
this
is
a
punitive
sort
of
regulation
in
this
respect.
the
buyers
and
sellers,
the
parties
who
have
regulated
start
out
in
the
first
instance
with
individual
contracts
which
they
make
according
to
their
own
evaluations
of
the
bargain.
then
superimposed
on
top
of
that
becomes
the
regulatory
powers
of
the
commission.
now,
this
i
think
is
the
source
of
a
good
deal
of
the
argument
and
confusion
with
respect
to
the
refund
write-offs.
what
this
commission
was
working
on
in
the
southern
louisiana
case
was
a
multitude
of
contracts
by
multitude
of
parties
that
had
been
negotiated
and
entered
into
at
variety
of
different
levels.
some
of
these
were
affected
by
refund
orders,
some
were
not.
the
important
--
sir?
mr.
john
r.
rebman
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
douglas
they
are
in
fact
the
commission
--
mr.
john
r.
rebman
that’s
right.
in
fact,
the
commission
excluded
from
evidence
some
occurrence
of
individual
company
proved
by
some
companies.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
that’s
absolutely
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
area
lines
and
also
the
utilization
of
composite
costs
and
this
was
thought
by
the
court
there
to
be
and
simply
an
unavoidable
aspect
of
group
regulation
that
the
agency
itself
was
not
required
to
look
at
the
individual
financial
impacts
on
each
entity
being
regulated.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
according
to
some
parties.[laughter
attempt]
here,
i
think
carrying
forward
the
concept
of
the
impacts
on
these
individual
companies
i
think
the
court
should
be
very
interested
in
looking
at
some
of
the
materials
in
the
volume
5
of
the
appendix
because
there,
one
can
evaluate
how
revenue
reductions,
resulting
revenues,
and
refunds
impacted
on
individual
companies
because
you
find
a
very
peculiar
thing.
we
hear
the
greatest
complaint
with
respect
to
the
refund
write-off
from
mobil
and
its
very
interesting
to
look
at
the
revenue
of
the
impact
of
the
commission's
decision
which
gives
mobil
the
highest
resulting
average
revenue,
third
highest
in
the
23
largest
producers
listed
and
in
fact
the
highest
in
the
10
largest,
although
their
refunds
are
relatively
modest.
now,
i
don’t
know
why
and
i
don’t
think
it’s
important
why.
what’s
important
is
that
different
parts
the
order
impact
different
producers
differently.
now
--
mr.
john
r.
rebman
no,
sir.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
the
revenue
under
the
order
prospectively
and
i
am
speaking
of
prospective
revenues
only
is
higher.
the
prospective
revenues
are
not
affected
by
the
refund
that’s
a
locked-in
period
for
the
past
only.
and
i
wish
i
could
get
to
some
of
the
questions
that
were
bothering
you
mr.
justice
white
[laughter
attempt]
and
i
think
perhaps
there’s
one
or
two
key
elements
here
and
that
is
that
the
commission
while
it
did
indicate
its
view
that
the
refund
floors
which
it
had
established
for
a
past
period
were
just
and
reasonable.
it
went
further.
it
expressed
the
opinion
that
the
formula
--
the
formula
i
am
reading
from
page
5
--
654
of
volume
2
of
the
appendix,
that
the
formula
for
determining
the
refund
obligations
during
this
period
is
found
to
be
just
and
reasonable.
so
i
think
you
have
to
accept
the
commission’s
view
that
it
was
dealing
with
a
range
of
costs,
old
and
new
and
that
there
is
a
zone
of
reasonableness
for
just
and
reasonable
rates
not
a
single
.2
decimal
place
estimate.
now,
carrying
the
fixed
amount
of
refund
obligations
forward
as
to
its
impact
on
the
individual
producers,
i
would
come
in
to
your
reading
very
strongly
the
brief
filed
by
intervenor
associated
gas
distributors.
there
is
a
large
group
of
distribution
companies
who
took
very
active
part
in
this
case
and
they
expressed
the
whole
problem
very,
very
well
i
think.
throughout
producer
regulation
from
the
very
first
the
commission
has
been
confronted
with
this
confounding
problem
of
trying
to
link
together
a
certain
price
in
a
certain
volume
of
gas.
it
has
been
unable
to
do
it,
it
cannot
do
it.
it
is
inherent
in
the
nature
of
an
industry
that
extends
the
bulk
of
its
exploratory
moneys
for
unsuccessful
project.
the
producers
in
general
every
year
expend
in
the
neighborhood
of
$1
billion
on
what
are
unsuccessful
projects,
mostly
dry
holes.
there’s
just
no
way
that
you
can
link
a
specific
price
to
two
decimals
to
a
specific
volume
of
gas.
the
commission
has
recognized
this
and
so
did
the
fifth
circuit.
so
what
this
refund
does
this
is
what
agd
points
out.
this
is
one
of
the
first
times
that
the
commission
has
been
able
to
provide
this
linkage
between
its
price
and
supply.
this
is
a
situation
where
the
consumer
either
gets
the
money
as
a
refund
or
he
gets
the
new
gas
commitment.
and
the
same
thing
applies
with
respect
to
the
contingent
escalation.
the
consumer
does
not
pay
that
unless
the
industry
provides
the
total
interstate
dedications
that
are
specified
in
the
opinion.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
in
general,
if
commission
provides
for
a
passed
through
from
the
pipe
lines
to
their
distribution
customers
and
then
it
is
turned
over
to
the
local
state
agencies.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
that’s
correct.
there’s
no
question
as
to
pipelines
in
general
are
under
orders
to
flow
through.
now,
the
commission
itself
made
a
judgment
from
the
same
page
i
cited
earlier
a
finding.
we
find
that
such
an
incentive
being
the
refund
discharge
will
be
a
net
benefit
to
the
consumer
by
obtaining
additional
gas
supply.
the
reason
it
is
such
a
benefit
is
because
of
this
direct
linkage
of
the
agd
describes
between
price
and
supply
and
we
think
this
is
one
of
the
crucial
parts
of
the
case.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
yes,
sir
i
do.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
in
fact
one
can
go
even
further
mr.
justice
white
the
--
mr.
john
r.
rebman
and
unless
they
--
unless,
you
see
here
is
the
thing.
those
refund
amounts
can
be
expended
to
exploration
and
the
unsuccessful
and
the
companies
still
be
left
to
raising
the
refund
obligation.
so
i
think
it’s
a
sort
of
--
mr.
john
r.
rebman
no
sir,
that’s
not
correct
they
have
to
and
each
individual
company
has
to
make
a
commitment.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
i
am
sorry
sir
you
were
speaking
in
reference
of
the
first
southern
louisiana
case
and
i
was
speaking
of
the
increment.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
yes,
sir.
i
think
that,
that
should
be
kept
in
the
context,
however
the
fact
that
while
a
commission
opinion
issued
with
respect
to
that
as
mr.
forquer
pointed
out
that
opinion
never
became
final
and
in
its
second
decision
the
commission
itself
recognized
that
its
error
in
that
regard.
and
here
is
an
interesting
point
about
that
the
--
if
you
look
at
page
277,
i
believe
it
is
at
volume
5.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
no
as
mr.
forquer
was
pointed
out
--
mr.
john
r.
rebman
they
use
the
word
affirmance
but
they
use
many
other
words
mr.
justice
white
including
its
remedy.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
i
don’t
think
i
said
that.
if
i
did,
i
misspoke
myself.
but
i
wanted
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
most
of
the
refunds
and
this
shows
on
page
277,
volume
5
that
are
required
by
the
present
opinion
all
in
the
late
years
the
late
60s
and
early
70s
and
this
is
why
it
was
most
appropriate
for
the
commission
to
focus
on
its
cost
computation
made
as
of
the
test
year
1969
not
to
test
year
1960
which
it
had
earlier
used
and
if
you
recall
mobil
described,
mobil’s
counsel
described
before
you
the
process
of
individual
companies
settlements
through
the
mid
60s.
and
these
settlements
themselves
had
eliminated
most
of
the
refund
obligations
by
making
refunds
through
the
early
late
50s
and
early
60s.
so
we
would
like
to
most
appropriate
that
the
commission
now
looks
at
the
1969
test
year
for
the
derivation
of
its
present
refund
obligation.
one
additional
point
i
think
should
be
made
in
this
respect
and
it
ties
back
to
the
court’s
decision
in
the
second
phillips.
you
recall
that
mr.
forquer
pointed
out
that
a
staff
witness
in
the
second
part
of
the
case
made
the
finding
and
a
recommendation
that
no
refunds
at
all
should
be
required
because
the
revenues
received
during
that
period
were
less
than
his
cost
estimates
on
an
aggregate
basis.
and
this
is
precisely
the
reason
that
in
phillips
too
this
court
affirmed
the
commission
for
not
requiring
refunds
of
that
company
in
a
similar
revenue
cost
position,
and
in
our
view
this
finding
gave
the
commission
the
power
to
utilize
this
refund
obligation
as
a
supply
eliciting
factor
in
its
overall
rate
design.
thank
you.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
address
my
first

the
materials
in
the
volume
5
of
the
appendix
because
there,
one
can
evaluate
how
revenue
reductions,
resulting
revenues,
and
refunds
impacted
on
individual
companies
because
you
find
a
very
peculiar
thing.
we
hear
the
greatest
complaint
with
respect
to
the
refund
write-off
from
mobil
and
its
very
interesting
to
look
at
the
revenue
of
the
impact
of
the
commission's
decision
which
gives
mobil
the
highest
resulting
average
revenue,
third
highest
in
the
23
largest
producers
listed
and
in
fact
the
highest
in
the
10
largest,
although
their
refunds
are
relatively
modest.
now,
i
don’t
know
why
and
i
don’t
think
it’s
important
why.
what’s
important
is
that
different
parts
the
order
impact
different
producers
differently.
now
--
mr.
john
r.
rebman
no,
sir.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
the
revenue
under
the
order
prospectively
and
i
am
speaking
of
prospective
revenues
only
is
higher.
the
prospective
revenues
are
not
affected
by
the
refund
that’s
a
locked-in
period
for
the
past
only.
and
i
wish
i
could
get
to
some
of
the
questions
that
were
bothering
you
mr.
justice
white
[laughter
attempt]
and
i
think
perhaps
there’s
one
or
two
key
elements
here
and
that
is
that
the
commission
while
it
did
indicate
its
view
that
the
refund
floors
which
it
had
established
for
a
past
period
were
just
and
reasonable.
it
went
further.
it
expressed
the
opinion
that
the
formula
--
the
formula
i
am
reading
from
page
5
--
654
of
volume
2
of
the
appendix,
that
the
formula
for
determining
the
refund
obligations
during
this
period
is
found
to
be
just
and
reasonable.
so
i
think
you
have
to
accept
the
commission’s
view
that
it
was
dealing
with
a
range
of
costs,
old
and
new
and
that
there
is
a
zone
of
reasonableness
for
just
and
reasonable
rates
not
a
single
.2
decimal
place
estimate.
now,
carrying
the
fixed
amount
of
refund
obligations
forward
as
to
its
impact
on
the
individual
producers,
i
would
come
in
to
your
reading
very
strongly
the
brief
filed
by
intervenor
associated
gas
distributors.
there
is
a
large
group
of
distribution
companies
who
took
very
active
part
in
this
case
and
they
expressed
the
whole
problem
very,
very
well
i
think.
throughout
producer
regulation
from
the
very
first
the
commission
has
been
confronted
with
this
confounding
problem
of
trying
to
link
together
a
certain
price
in
a
certain
volume
of
gas.
it
has
been
unable
to
do
it,
it
cannot
do
it.
it
is
inherent
in
the
nature
of
an
industry
that
extends
the
bulk
of
its
exploratory
moneys
for
unsuccessful
project.
the
producers
in
general
every
year
expend
in
the
neighborhood
of
$1
billion
on
what
are
unsuccessful
projects,
mostly
dry
holes.
there’s
just
no
way
that
you
can
link
a
specific
price
to
two
decimals
to
a
specific
volume
of
gas.
the
commission
has
recognized
this
and
so
did
the
fifth
circuit.
so
what
this
refund
does
this
is
what
agd
points
out.
this
is
one
of
the
first
times
that
the
commission
has
been
able
to
provide
this
linkage
between
its
price
and
supply.
this
is
a
situation
where
the
consumer
either
gets
the
money
as
a
refund
or
he
gets
the
new
gas
commitment.
and
the
same
thing
applies
with
respect
to
the
contingent
escalation.
the
consumer
does
not
pay
that
unless
the
industry
provides
the
total
interstate
dedications
that
are
specified
in
the
opinion.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
in
general,
if
commission
provides
for
a
passed
through
from
the
pipe
lines
to
their
distribution
customers
and
then
it
is
turned
over
to
the
local
state
agencies.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
that’s
correct.
there’s
no
question
as
to
pipelines
in
general
are
under
orders
to
flow
through.
now,
the
commission
itself
made
a
judgment
from
the
same
page
i
cited
earlier
a
finding.
we
find
that
such
an
incentive
being
the
refund
discharge
will
be
a
net
benefit
to
the
consumer
by
obtaining
additional
gas
supply.
the
reason
it
is
such
a
benefit
is
because
of
this
direct
linkage
of
the
agd
describes
between
price
and
supply
and
we
think
this
is
one
of
the
crucial
parts
of
the
case.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
yes,
sir
i
do.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
in
fact
one
can
go
even
further
mr.
justice
white
the
--
mr.
john
r.
rebman
and
unless
they
--
unless,
you
see
here
is
the
thing.
those
refund
amounts
can
be
expended
to
exploration
and
the
unsuccessful
and
the
companies
still
be
left
to
raising
the
refund
obligation.
so
i
think
it’s
a
sort
of
--
mr.
john
r.
rebman
no
sir,
that’s
not
correct
they
have
to
and
each
individual
company
has
to
make
a
commitment.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
i
am
sorry
sir
you
were
speaking
in
reference
of
the
first
southern
louisiana
case
and
i
was
speaking
of
the
increment.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
yes,
sir.
i
think
that,
that
should
be
kept
in
the
context,
however
the
fact
that
while
a
commission
opinion
issued
with
respect
to
that
as
mr.
forquer
pointed
out
that
opinion
never
became
final
and
in
its
second
decision
the
commission
itself
recognized
that
its
error
in
that
regard.
and
here
is
an
interesting
point
about
that
the
--
if
you
look
at
page
277,
i
believe
it
is
at
volume
5.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
no
as
mr.
forquer
was
pointed
out
--
mr.
john
r.
rebman
they
use
the
word
affirmance
but
they
use
many
other
words
mr.
justice
white
including
its
remedy.
mr.
john
r.
rebman
i
don’t
think
i
said
that.
if
i
did,
i
misspoke
myself.
but
i
wanted
to
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
most
of
the
refunds
and
this
shows
on
page
277,
volume
5
that
are
required
by
the
present
opinion
all
in
the
late
years
the
late
60s
and
early
70s
and
this
is
why
it
was
most
appropriate
for
the
commission
to
focus
on
its
cost
computation
made
as
of
the
test
year
1969
not
to
test
year
1960
which
it
had
earlier
used
and
if
you
recall
mobil
described,
mobil’s
counsel
described
before
you
the
process
of
individual
companies
settlements
through
the
mid
60s.
and
these
settlements
themselves
had
eliminated
most
of
the
refund
obligations
by
making
refunds
through
the
early
late
50s
and
early
60s.
so
we
would
like
to
most
appropriate
that
the
commission
now
looks
at
the
1969
test
year
for
the
derivation
of
its
present
refund
obligation.
one
additional
point
i
think
should
be
made
in
this
respect
and
it
ties
back
to
the
court’s
decision
in
the
second
phillips.
you
recall
that
mr.
forquer
pointed
out
that
a
staff
witness
in
the
second
part
of
the
case
made
the
finding
and
a
recommendation
that
no
refunds
at
all
should
be
required
because
the
revenues
received
during
that
period
were
less
than
his
cost
estimates
on
an
aggregate
basis.
and
this
is
precisely
the
reason
that
in
phillips
too
this
court
affirmed
the
commission
for
not
requiring
refunds
of
that
company
in
a
similar
revenue
cost
position,
and
in
our
view
this
finding
gave
the
commission
the
power
to
utilize
this
refund
obligation
as
a
supply
eliciting
factor
in
its
overall
rate
design.
thank
you.
