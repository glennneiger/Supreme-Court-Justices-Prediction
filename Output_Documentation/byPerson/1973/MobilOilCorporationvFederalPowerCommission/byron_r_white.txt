justice
byron
r.
white
well,
this
was
a
reestablishment
of
just
and
reasonable
rates
that
have
been
established
in
sola
i?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
just
for
refund
purposes?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
would
be
any
anything
that
collected
over
that
they
had
refund
and
that
happen
--
it
ended
up
being
a
$150
million?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
nevertheless,
i
suppose
to
have
the
authority
to
reduce
the
refund
you
had
to
raise
--
the
commission
had
to
raise
the
just
and
reasonable
rate?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
the
work
off?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
does
the
right
--
but
you’re
going
to
work
off
--
they
can
work
off
the
remainder
of
the
refund?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
every
time
they
work
off
for
a
little
bit
of
it,
i
bet
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
goes
up?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
didn’t
realize
--
are
you
asserting
that
commission
may
find,
may
suspend
rates
or
let
rates
go
into
effect
subject
to
refund
which
they
did
in
sola
i,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
establish
just
and
reasonable
rates
lower
than
what
the
rates
were
and
yet
forgive
a
refund?
justice
byron
r.
white
lower
than
have
been
charged.
let’s
assume
that
they
filed
rates
and
the
commission
let’s
them
go
into
effect,
subject
to
refund?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
they
have
a
proceeding
and
they
establish
what
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
is
and
it
is
lower
than
what
has
been
charged?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
do
you
say
they
have
it
--
they
have
discretion
if
they
find
that
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
is
lower
than
what
has
been
charged
to
forgive
a
refund?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
is
the
authority
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
why
did
they
even
go
to
the
trouble
of
resetting
just
and
reasonable
rate?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
didn’t
have
to,
they
could
just
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
have
some
judicial
authority
for
the
fact
that
they
--
that
the
commission
may
forgive
refunds
even
though
it
finds
that
the
rate
has
been
charged
--
that
has
been
permitted
to
go
into
effect
subject
to
refund
is
higher
than
what
the
just
and
reasonable
rate
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
they
could
just
need
an
order
of
a
refund
even
though
they
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well
you
certainly
are
--
you
certainly
are
putting
the
–
certainly,
you
are
charging
all
consumers
on
all
the
money
for
a
future
exploration?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
commission
might
have
even
set
a
higher
price
for
new
gas?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
for
flowing
gas?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
$150
million?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
the
old
amount?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
anybody
with
flowing
gas
i
suppose
and
with
a
refund
obligation,
the
larger
the
better
now,
i
guess
has
got
to
--
had
quite
an
incentive,
or
quite
an
advantage
in
exploring
for
--
in
bidding
for
a
new
gas
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
but
with
--
forget
the
refund
for
the
moment.
a
person
with
first
with
flowing
gas,
the
price
is
for
that
flowing
gas
has
been
increased?
justice
byron
r.
white
for
not
discovering
non-cost
item
--
exploration
item?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
going
to
be
escalated
for
that
purpose
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
suggestion
is
that
we
--
that
is
perfectly
alright
for
the
commission
to
tell
all
consumers,
“well,
you’ve
been
paying
unjust
and
unreasonable
rates,
but
nevertheless
we
are
not
going
to
order
a
refund
because
we
think
we
should
stimulate
further
explorations?”
justice
byron
r.
white
why
put
it
on
just
to
people
who
have
been
buying
old
gas?
i
mean
they’ve
been
paying
unjust
and
unreasonable
rates
and
the
larger
and
more
unjust,
the
more
unreasonable
they
are,
the
more
they
are
going
to
be
charge
for
a
future
price?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
has
it
been
a
traditional
function
of
rate
making
to
finance
expansion?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
to
build
up
internal
sources
of
capital?
justice
byron
r.
white
[voice
overlap]
i
said
traditional.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
agree
with
you,
i
know
what
the
permian
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
true.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
revenue
would
be
somewhat
higher
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
who
will
get
the
refunds
that
are
probably
made
in
pipelines
although
they
would
be
passed
through?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think,
we
really
are
talking
about
the
consumers
not
just
the
pipelines
in
general?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
commission
must
presume
and
i
suppose
the
court
assumes
if
you
read
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
refunds
are
given
in
order
to
stimulate
exploration.
now,
the
use
of
the
refunds,
are
these
[inaudible]?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that’s
my
entire
point?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
can
also
not
expend
it
for
exploration
at
all
and
still
not
have
the
refund?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
already
have
their
refund
obligation
because
of
that
situation
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
are
given
the
refund
obligation
if
that
is
so
what
it
wants.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
the
commission
has
conceded
that
there
is
error
[inaudible]
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happens
if
they
were
quite
right?
before
we
know,
this
time,
they
were
quite
right.
and
even
use
the
word
affirmance.
justice
byron
r.
white
[inaudible]
that
it

justice

what

justice

white
well,
i

but
does
the
right

but
you’re
going

they
can
work

the
