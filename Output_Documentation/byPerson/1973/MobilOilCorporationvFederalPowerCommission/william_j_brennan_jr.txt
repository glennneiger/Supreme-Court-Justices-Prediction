justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
morrow,
may
i
ask?
do
i
correctly
read
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
as
suggesting
that
the
only
issue
of
judicial
review
as
they
saw
the
case,
those
universal
camera
problem
whether
or
not
the
order
of
the
commission
was
supported
by
substantial
evidence?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
your
argument
goes
beyond
that,
doesn't
it?
it
challenges
the
provisions
of
the
order
not
as
unsupported
by
substantial
evidence
for
further
rehearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
do
you
read
the
fifth
circuit
as
expressly
addressing
that
question
or
as
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
they
were
right,
if
they
were
right
in
thinking
as
the
only
question
of
judicial
review
as
the
shorthand
universal
camera
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
that
--
if
they
were
right
about
that,
then
our
review
is
even
more
limited,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
think
those
are
open,
assuming
again
we
were
to
agree
with
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
approach,
do
you
still
think
those
would
be
open?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
morrow,
in
that
connection,
didn’t
the
fifth
circuit
say
that,
in
its
opinion
on
rehearing
on
the
first
order,
it
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
it
was
not
affirming,
it
was
reading
the
commission,
all
the
authority
in
the
world
reopen
everything
if
it
wanted
to,
didn’t
it
say
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
did
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
have,
again,
i
am
looking
for
it,
i
cannot
find
it.
in
the
opinion
before
us
now,
on
the
order
on
the
judgment
under
review,
were
they
addressed
whether
or
not
they
left
these
things
open
in
a
petition
for
rehearing
on
the
first
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
can’t
seem
to
find
that.
i
thought
i
was
[voice
overlap]
something
in
it
which
is
contrary
to
the
implications
to
which
you
read
us
from
the
first
opinion?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
don’t
let
me
waste
your
time
mr.
morrow,
i
will
find
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
morrow,
i
found
finally
what
i
had
in
mind.

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
petition,
dealing
with
flowing
gas,
at
the
bottom
of
page
30,
where
judge
brown
says,
after
referring
to
the
first
order,
the
eighteen-and-a-half
and
then
the
nineteen-and-a-half
cent
rates.
although
he
pointed
out
that
our
mandate
was
an
affirmance
of
these
rates,
he
pointed
and
he
emphasized
that
our
opinion
did
not
foreclose
the
possibility
of
change.
on
rehearing,
we
reiterated,
we
wish
to
make
crystal
clear
the
authority
of
the
commission
in
this
case
to
reopen
any
part
of
its
order
if
circumstances
require,
then
reopen.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
know
mr.
forquer
whether
that
question
was
raised
on
the
petition
for
cert
here
from
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
forquer?
i
gather
that
the
fifth
circuit
did
apply
the
three
criterion
of
judicial
review
under
permian?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
concluded
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
were
all
satisfied.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
what’s
the
scope
of
our
review,
of
that
determination
of
the
fifth
circuit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
we
to
do
the
job
of
the
fifth
circuit
did?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
think
we
should
do?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
how
was
that
computed?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
they
just
didn't
pick
the
150
million
out
of
the
air,
and
say
that
was
a
fair
figure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what’s
[inaudible]
to
ask
mr.
morrow.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
both
these
two
decisions
can
stand
together?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whatever
we
do
in
this
case
will
govern
just
to
happen
on
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
these
cases
we
review
the
affirmance
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
fifth
circuit,
the
1971
order
of
the
federal
power
commission
that
established
an
area
rate
structure
for
interstate
sales
of
natural
gas
produced
in
the
southern
louisiana
area.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.

stewart
and
mr.

took
