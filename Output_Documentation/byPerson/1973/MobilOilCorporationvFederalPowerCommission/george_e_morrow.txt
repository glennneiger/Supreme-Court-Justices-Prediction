with
the

we

one
some

it
ought
to
come

mr.

we
appreciate
that
your
honor.[luncheon

mr.
george
e.
morrow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
george
morrow
and
i
represent
the
municipal
distributors
group
in
this
case
which
is
a
group
of
approximately
200
municipal
distribution
systems
throughout
the
country
and
i
also
have
the
honor
to
speak
for
the
new
york
public
service
commission
in
this
argument.
the
municipal
distributors
and
new
york
are
here
objecting
to
two
elements
of
the
commission’s
order
in
this
case
which
relay
either
to
gas
already
sold
and
delivered
or
else
the
gas
already
committed
to
long
term
contracts.
these
two
elements
are;
first,
that
drastic
modification
of
refunds
ordered
by
the
court
in
this
case
which
changed
the
refunds
which
had
been
ordered
in
an
earlier
case
in
1968.
secondly,
a
provision
for
four
and
one-half
cent
future
escalations
in
the
rates
for
flowing
gas
from
this
area,
the
first
of
which
alone,
when
applied
to
the
80
trillion
cubic
feet
of
known
proven
reserves
of
flowing
gas
would
at
one
stroke,
increase
their
value
by
about
$400
million.
first,
as
to
the
refund
issue
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
and
they
kept
talking,
yes,
your
honor
and
they
kept
talking
about
substantial
evidence
on
the
record
as
a
whole
without
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
it
challenges
them
as
unsupported,
but
before
we
get
to
that,
we
challenge
the
right
of
the
commission
to
reopen
its
1968
order.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
i
did
not
find
anything
in
that
question
in
the
fifth
circuit’s
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
if
there
were
no
serious
questions
concerning
the
record
in
this
case,
concerning
the
substantive
evidence
on
which
the
record
is
based,
then
obviously
if
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
fifth
circuit,
i
mean,
of
the
fifth
circuit,
decides
that
on
a
factual
basis,
this
court
would
not
review.
but
we
feel
that
there
are
serious
legal
issues
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
i
think
those
would
be
open,
yes
sir.
let
me
explain
the
first
one,
on
the
refund
issue.
the
commission
in
opinion
546
which
is
southern
louisiana
1,
in
1968
made
findings
as
to
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
gas
in
the
southern
louisiana
area
and
these
findings
related
to
gas
from
1954,
the
inception
of
producer
regulation
up
through
1968,
the
date
of
the
order.
finding
that
the
producers
had
charged
excessive
rates,
this
commission
ordered
refunds,
the
amount
of
which
approximated
$376
million.
three
years
later,
in
opinion
number
598
which
is
now
under
review
and
which
i
refer
to
as
southern
louisiana
2,
the
commission
reopened
its
final
order
in
the
1968
docket,
which
had
been
affirmed
on
appeal
and
modified
two
elements
of
the
costs
found
in
that
document,
modified
them
retroactively
and
since
it
modified
those
cost
items
retroactively
and
increased
them,
that
of
course
had
an
effect
upon
the
refunds
which
it
had
ordered
in
the
other
case
and
so
it
drastically
modified
its
1968
refund
order,
reducing
it
at
one
fell
of
swoop
by
$226
million
and
then
providing
for
the
work
off
of
the
remaining
$150
million
by
dedications
of
gas
by
the
producers
to
interstate
commerce
in
the
future.
now,
our
proposition
in
this
case,
the
basic
legal
proposition
is
very
simple.
the
commission
had
no
power
by
its
1971
order
to
reopen
a
final
judicially
affirmed
1968
order
and
modify
the
fact
findings
in
that
final
1968
order
and
change
the
refunds
relating
to
the
1954
to
1968
[voice
overlap].
mr.
george
e.
morrow
no
sir,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
did
not.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
and
that’s
where
we
come
to
nub
of
the
case.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
your
honor,
that
was
discussed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
southern
louisiana
1.
it
was
one
of
the
main
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
southern
louisiana
2
and
of
course
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
case,
the
court
of
appeals
at
d.c.
disagreed
and
said
we
are
past
the
experimental
stage
now
and
you
cannot
get
by
with
that
sort
of
thing
by
calling
it
experimental.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
they
were
dealing
with
an
almost
identical
record,
your
honor,
the
same
issues.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
not
the
same
numbers,
but
certainly
the
same
issues,
the
same
type
of
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
the
same
settlement.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
the
68
record?
mr.
george
e.
morrow
your
honor,
it
was
using
that
for
the
purpose
of
excusing
some
very
loose
findings
on
the
part
of
the
federal
power
commission.
in
the
first
southern
louisiana
case,
the
court
said
“we
are
not
going
to
let
the
federal
power
commission
get
by
with
basing
its
conclusions
on
such
loose
findings
and
basing
findings
on
such
big
and
general
factual
allegations
in
the
future,
particularly
non-cost
findings.”
in
the
future,
if
the
commission
wants
to
put
non-cost
additives
onto
a
rate
of
return,
onto
a
rate,
it’s
got
to
show
what
those
additives,
how
much
they
are
needed,
and
what
they
will
accomplish.
and
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
case
reversed
the
commission
for
because
it
had
not
shown
just
exactly
that,
that
the
non
cost
additives
were
worth
what
they
cost
in
effect.
but
your
honor,
you
asked
what
--
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
case
have
decided
and
let
me
read
it
to
you.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
your
honor,
this
is
in
the
first
case
and
it’s
not
in
the
record
here,
i
happen
to
have
a
record
of
the
first
case
and
--
sir?
mr.
george
e.
morrow
the
court
said,
since
we
have
concluded
that
the
commission
is
on
the
right
course
now,
our
best
course
is
to
keep
within
the
proper
sphere
of
a
reviewing
court.
the
point
is
that
the
probability
of
shortage
based
on
new
evidence
is
not
before
us
for
review.
all
that
is
before
us
is
the
legal
adequacy
and
not
the
wisdom
of
the
commission’s
orders.
finally
and
most
importantly
in
the
light
of
permian,
we
think
we
are
required
to
hold
that
the
commission’s
orders
in
this
case
are
procedurally
and
substantively
adequate
under
the
law.
whether
they
are
ultimately
wise
is
a
question
to
be
presented
not
to
the
court,
but
to
the
commission
and
again
in
the
later
page
which
i
don’t
see
right
now,
it
says
we
hold
that
permian
requires
affirmance
and
then
on
its
opinion
on
rehearing,
it
reiterated
this
is
an
affirmance
and
not
a
remand.
so
what
happened
was,
and
incidentally
this
is
the
sole
basis
on
which
the
commission
now
rests
its
case.
if
this
order
in
southern
louisiana
1,
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
valid,
then
the
whole
defense
of
the
commission
of
its
refund
orders
must
collapse.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
i
am
looking
in
the
appendices
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
alright,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
sir?
mr.
george
e.
morrow
if
it
had
not
been
a
final
order
then
i
presume
it
would
not
have
been
a
final
order
your
honor
that’s
correct.
but
this
was
a
final
order
and
the
commission
defended
it
before
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
final
order
and
successfully
defended
every
single
finding
in
that
case.
now
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
first
to
affirm,
because
it
says
we
have
to
affirm.
the
commission’s
opinion
is
based
solidly
on
evidence
in
the
record
and
we
have
no
choice,
but
to
affirm.
it
then
went
on
to
say
that
with
respect
to
this
lawful
order,
we
make,
it
says
we
rely
upon
the
broad
remedial
powers
that
in
here
in
the
court
of
equity
and
for
acting
pursuant
to
its
equitable
powers
stated,
we
make
it
part
of
the
remedy
in
this
case
that
the
authority
of
the
commission
to
reopen
any
part
of
its
orders
is
left
intact.
now
our
position
is
very
simply,
that
if
the
commission
order
was
lawful
in
all
respects,
there
was
no
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
provide
a
remedy,
a
judicial
equitable
remedy
for
a
perfectly
lawful
order.
once
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
commission
order
was
substantially
supported
by
facts
and
findings
in
the
record,
its
jurisdiction
was
at
an
end
with
respect
to
that
order
and
this
court
said
so
in
natural
gas
pipeline
versus
f.p.c.
which
is
cited
in
our
reply
brief.
the
court
said
this,
referring
to
the
court’s
review
of
the
commission
order,
“once
a
fair
hearing
has
been
given,
proper
findings
made
and
other
statutory
requirements
satisfied
the
courts
can
not
intervene,
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
showing
that
the
limits
of
due
process
have
been
overstepped.”
and
again
this
court,
in
sec
versus
chenery
corporation
said
that
it’s
the
duty
of
a
reviewing
court,
that
the
duty
of
a
reviewing
court
“is
that
an
end
when
it
becomes
evident
that
the
commission’s
action
is
based
upon
substantial
evidence
and
is
consistent
with
the
authority
granted
by
congress.”
this
is
the
crucial
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
ford
motor
case
and
all
the
other
cases
that
are
cited
along
that
line
by
the
commission
and
the
intervenors
in
this
case.
in
the
ford
motor
case,
the
agency
had
committed
legal
error.
someone’s
rights
had
been
violated.
a
wrong,
a
legal
wrong
had
been
perpetrated
and
this
called
upon
the
equity
powers
of
the
court,
the
remedial
powers
of
the
court
to
provide
a
remedy
for
the
wrong,
to
provide
relief
for
someone
who
had
received
legal
injury.
in
the
present
case
or
rather
in
southern
louisiana
1,
there
was
no
legal
wrong.
the
commission’s
opinion
was
affirmed
in
all
respects
upon
the
special
request
of
the
commission,
and
therefore,
the
court
had
no
power
under
the
natural
gas
act,
as
part
of
its
reviewing
power
under
the
natural
gas
act,
it
had
no
power
to
go
ahead
and
provide
a
legal
equitable
remedy,
judicial
equitable
remedy
for
a
perfectly
lawful
order.
but
if
the
commission
had
no
power
to
change
that
order
which
was
perfectly
lawful,
then
it
certainly
had
no
power
to
use
its
equitable
remedial
rights
to
invest
such
an
unprecedented
power
in
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
that’s
correct.
that’s
what
the
court
purported
to
do
and
it’s
our
position
that
the
court
simply
could
not
do
both.
it
cannot
affirm
and
at
the
same
time
provide
a
judicial
equitable
remedy
for
perfectly
valid
order
and
that
is
what
it
purported
to
do
in
this
case.
now
there
is
--
the
new
york
commission
emphasizes
this
point
that
in
that
southern
louisiana
1,
the
court
had
carefully
and
exhaustively
reviewed
every
single
fact
finding
of
the
commission
and
it
had
affirmed
every
fact
finding
of
the
commission.
and
regardless
of
how
you
construe
the
commission’s
final
order
in
the
case,
it
is
not
reasonable
to
construe
it
as
having
the
court
say
we
just
reviewed
all
of
these
facts
and
costs,
we
affirm
them
all,
now
federal
commission
go
and
change
them.
in
other
words,
if
the
court
was
leaving
anything
open
validly
in
the
southern
louisiana
1
case,
it
was
leaving
open
matters
with
respect
to
non-cost
additives.
but
that
brings
us
to
the
second
leg
of
our
case,
of
our
position
here,
and
that
is
that
even
if
the
commission’s
reopening
of
its
1968
opinion
were
lawful,
the
manner
in
which
it
did
so
is
totally,
totally
unsupported
on
the
record.
this
is
not
just
a
matter
of
conflicting
findings.
this
is
a
matter
of
a
mis-analysis
of
the
facts.
the
sole
basis
upon
which
the
commission
made
its
change
in
the
1968
refund
order
was
on
its
finding
in
the
1971
case
that
it
had
committed
error,
factual
error
in
the
previous
case.
the
commission
said,
opinion
546
did
not
afford
an
adequate
return
and
it
understated
the
requirements
for
exploration
and
development.
in
the
light
of
these
inadequacies,
the
commission
said,
we
find
that
the
rights
of
20.625
cents
and
21
and
a
quarter
cents
as
a
based
for
refunds
are
reasonable
and
in
the
public
interest.
so
the
only
basis
for
the
finding
as
to
the
refunds
was
that
the
1968
order
was
in
error
with
respect
to
rate
of
return
and
allocation
of
exploration
and
development
costs.
the
rate
of
--
but
the
court
--
the
fallacy
here
is
that
the
commission
never
reviewed
its
1968
record.
it
never
went
back
to
determine
whether
the
fact
findings
in
that
record
were
wrong.
what
it
did
was
to
use
its
findings
in
the
new
case,
its
rate
of
return
based
on
the
1971
decision
and
using
the
economic
conditions
and
the
capital
conditions
of
the
1971
decision,
defined
the
of
rate
of
return
there
and
it
took
that
rate
of
return
and
said
because
this
is
higher,
this
is
13
to
16%,
therefore,
we
find
that
the
12%
rate
of
return
that
we
ordered
in
the
1968
opinion
is
inadequate.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
the
rate
of
return
in
the
second
case
is
no
evidence
as
to
the
inadequacy
of
the
rate
of
return
in
the
first
case.
the
same
thing
is
true
with
the
other
cost
element
which
is
a
major
cost
element.
the
allocation
of
costs
is
between
a
dry
hole
cost
or
exploration
and
development
costs
between
oil
and
gas.
it
used
a
new
method
in
southern
louisiana
2,
but
it
never
applied
that
method
to
the
costs
in
southern
louisiana
1.
so
regardless
of
the
result
that
it
reached
in
southern
louisiana
2,
it
could
not
use
that
result
as
evidence
that
it
had
been
wrong,
erroneous
or
inadequate
in
southern
louisiana
1.
so
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
the
court,
the
commission’s
changing
of
its
rates
in
the
earlier
opinion,
and
therefore,
no
evidence
to
support
the
change
of
its
refunds
in
that
period.
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
get
into
the
escalation
provisions
which,
as
i
say
the
first
one-half
cent
escalation
provision
amounts
to
$400
million.
there
are
three
additional
escalation
measures.
now,
mobil
in
its
brief
has
discussed
in
great
detail
the
discriminatory
aspects
of
these.
i
only
want
to
say
this
about
them.
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
the
commission’s
opinion
to
support
them.
there
is
no
evidence
or
that
there
is
going
to
be
anything
like
that
kind
of
fact,
of
cost
increase
in
the
future.
this
gas
is
the
gas
that
has
already
been
found.
this
gas,
they
have
already
had
the
lease
costs,
the
dry
hole
cost,
the
drilling
cost,
all
of
the
costs
have
been
expended
in
the
past
except
the
cost
of
sitting
there
and
letting
the
gas
flow
from
the
well
bore
into
the
pipeline.
and
as
new
york
points
out
in
its
brief
those
cash
cost
actually
decreased
between
1968
and
1971
and
there
is
no
finding
in
the
future
that
those
costs
are
going
to
increase
in
any
perceptible
degree
and
no
conceivable
possibility
that
those
costs
will
increase
in
the
realm
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars,
as
is
involved
in
these
half-cent
increases.
the
commission
never
made
any
findings
as
to
how
much
good
these
half-cent
increases
were
going
to
do.
whether
they
were
needed,
in
the
first
place
and
if
they
were
needed,
there
was
no
balancing
of
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
costs
versus
the
probable
new
reserves
that
will
be
gotten
as
a
result
of
them.
so
this
is
what
disturbed
judge
leventhal
too.
judge
leventhal,
addressing
this
precise
issue
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
case
concluded
that
since
the
rates
for
new
gas
had
been
expressly
found
by
the
commission
to
be
adequate,
alone,
the
rates
for
new
gas
alone
and
to
induce
capital
investment
in
the
area,
there
was
no
basis
for
an
extra
allowance
to
rates
for
old
gas
to
accomplish
all
over
again
identically
the
same
thing.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
your
honor
if
i
may.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
thank
you
sir.
first,
with
respect
to
justice
brennan’s
question
about
the
standard
used
by
ca
five
in
reviewing
the
rate.
we
contend
that
they
used
the
wrong
standard
and
that
this
court
will
look
at
the
texas
gulf
coast
trade,
you’ll
find
the
exactly
the
right
standard
that
should
be
used.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
sir?
mr.
george
e.
morrow
no
sir,
one
of
them
is
wrong.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
that
case
used
of
virtually
identically
the
same
or
settlement
provision
that
this
case
has
used,
yes,
your
honor.
so
it
was
modeled
directly
after
this
case.
they
both
got
to
stand
afoul
it
seems
to
me
and
we
suggest
that
the
general
result
that
mr.
forquer
was
said
that
the
court
used
there,
what’s
the
general
overall
result,
that’s
not
the
proper
standard.
this
court
has
said
that
each
essential
element
of
the
cost
of
service
must
be
supported
by
evidence.
and
we
contend
that
it’s
not
in
this
case.
now,
as
to
the
matter
that
your
honor
raised
justice
white,
as
to
the
discretion
of
the
commission
to
order
refunds,
we
treated
that
right
strongly
in
our
reply
brief
and
would
commend
that
to
your
attention
because
we
take
the
position
that
the
commission
has
no
discretion
to
allow
a
company
to
remain
unjustly
enriched
by
unlawful
exactions
from
its
customers,
particularly
under
an
act
that’s
supposed
to
give
complete
permanent
and
effective
bond
of
protection
to
the
consumers.
as
to
the
compromise
--
as
to
the
$150
million
of
refunds,
i
must
take
issue
with
mr.
forquer
as
to
how
that
was
arrived
at.
it
was
pulled
right
square
out
of
the
air.
it
was
a
result
of
settlement
negotiations
and
after
that
$150
million
figure
had
been
reached,
then
the
commission
started
building
a
floor
of
cost
under
it
to
support
it.
and
it
couldn’t
find
the
cost
in
its
cost
of
service
to
support
that
reduction
to
a
$150
million
and
that’s
why
the
commission
went
back
to
1968
and
remodeled
its
1968
opinion
and
all
--
and
it
did
so
by
using
a
different
kind
of
cost
allocation
method
in
this
case.
the
cost
allegation
method
which
the
commission
used
in
this
case
was
one
it
had
rejected
in
every
other
case
it’s
ever
had
of
producers.
the
only
reason
that
this
cost
allocation
method
was
used
in
this
case
was
to
jack
up
retroactively
the
cost
in
southern
louisiana
1,
so
that
they
would
meet
this
package
deal
that
had
been
presented
to
the
commission.
if
it
please
the
court,
the
thing
that's
basically
wrong
with
this
case
is
that
we
have
a
serious
question
here,
a
serious
problem
and
the
commission
and
it
demands
a
rational
well
thought
out
result.
and
what
the
commission
has
done
has
abdicated
its
responsibility
to
a
kind
of
regulation
by
negotiation
by
the
industry
itself.
and
with
respect
to
the
refund
--
with
respect
to
the
whole
thing,
you
got
a
negotiation
between
selling
parties
who
are
the
producers
controlling
virtually
the
entire
supply
of
gas
in
southern
louisiana.
and
buying
parties,
the
pipelines
and
the
distributors
who
had
desperate
for
gas
must
to
get
it
from
these
producers
and
can
resell
it
at
any
rate
that
the
producers
proposed
to
sell
it
to
them
for
and
who
have
no
interest
in
the
refunds
whatsoever
because
as
mr.
rebman
pointed
out
the
pipelines
don’t
keep
them,
they
pass
them
along
to
the
distributors
and
the
distributors
do
not
keep
them
there,
the
state
regulatory
agencies
make
them
passed
along.
so
the
negotiations
that
resulted
in
this
$150
million
worth
of
refunds
were
by
people
who
were
negotiating
with
other
people’s
money.
and
that
is
how
they
got
down
to
the
$150
million.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
i
have
one
matter
before
my
argument,
if
i
might
take
it
up
with
the
court.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
we
have
not
yet
filed
a
reply
brief
to
the
brief
of
the
government
and
the
other
parties
because
the
government’s
brief
was
late.[voice
overlap]
with
the
court’s
permission,
we
will
file
one
some
time
today.
it
ought
to
come
from
the
plaintiff.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
we
appreciate
that
your
honor.[luncheon
recess]
mr.
george
e.
morrow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
george
morrow
and
i
represent
the
municipal
distributors
group
in
this
case
which
is
a
group
of
approximately
200
municipal
distribution
systems
throughout
the
country
and
i
also
have
the
honor
to
speak
for
the
new
york
public
service
commission
in
this
argument.
the
municipal
distributors
and
new
york
are
here
objecting
to
two
elements
of
the
commission’s
order
in
this
case
which
relay
either
to
gas
already
sold
and
delivered
or
else
the
gas
already
committed
to
long
term
contracts.
these
two
elements
are;
first,
that
drastic
modification
of
refunds
ordered
by
the
court
in
this
case
which
changed
the
refunds
which
had
been
ordered
in
an
earlier
case
in
1968.
secondly,
a
provision
for
four
and
one-half
cent
future
escalations
in
the
rates
for
flowing
gas
from
this
area,
the
first
of
which
alone,
when
applied
to
the
80
trillion
cubic
feet
of
known
proven
reserves
of
flowing
gas
would
at
one
stroke,
increase
their
value
by
about
$400
million.
first,
as
to
the
refund
issue
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
and
they
kept
talking,
yes,
your
honor
and
they
kept
talking
about
substantial
evidence
on
the
record
as
a
whole
without
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
it
challenges
them
as
unsupported,
but
before
we
get
to
that,
we
challenge
the
right
of
the
commission
to
reopen
its
1968
order.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
i
did
not
find
anything
in
that
question
in
the
fifth
circuit’s
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
if
there
were
no
serious
questions
concerning
the
record
in
this
case,
concerning
the
substantive
evidence
on
which
the
record
is
based,
then
obviously
if
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
fifth
circuit,
i
mean,
of
the
fifth
circuit,
decides
that
on
a
factual
basis,
this
court
would
not
review.
but
we
feel
that
there
are
serious
legal
issues
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
i
think
those
would
be
open,
yes
sir.
let
me
explain
the
first
one,
on
the
refund
issue.
the
commission
in
opinion
546
which
is
southern
louisiana
1,
in
1968
made
findings
as
to
the
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
gas
in
the
southern
louisiana
area
and
these
findings
related
to
gas
from
1954,
the
inception
of
producer
regulation
up
through
1968,
the
date
of
the
order.
finding
that
the
producers
had
charged
excessive
rates,
this
commission
ordered
refunds,
the
amount
of
which
approximated
$376
million.
three
years
later,
in
opinion
number
598
which
is
now
under
review
and
which
i
refer
to
as
southern
louisiana
2,
the
commission
reopened
its
final
order
in
the
1968
docket,
which
had
been
affirmed
on
appeal
and
modified
two
elements
of
the
costs
found
in
that
document,
modified
them
retroactively
and
since
it
modified
those
cost
items
retroactively
and
increased
them,
that
of
course
had
an
effect
upon
the
refunds
which
it
had
ordered
in
the
other
case
and
so
it
drastically
modified
its
1968
refund
order,
reducing
it
at
one
fell
of
swoop
by
$226
million
and
then
providing
for
the
work
off
of
the
remaining
$150
million
by
dedications
of
gas
by
the
producers
to
interstate
commerce
in
the
future.
now,
our
proposition
in
this
case,
the
basic
legal
proposition
is
very
simple.
the
commission
had
no
power
by
its
1971
order
to
reopen
a
final
judicially
affirmed
1968
order
and
modify
the
fact
findings
in
that
final
1968
order
and
change
the
refunds
relating
to
the
1954
to
1968
[voice
overlap].
mr.
george
e.
morrow
no
sir,
mr.
justice
brennan,
it
did
not.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
and
that’s
where
we
come
to
nub
of
the
case.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
your
honor,
that
was
discussed
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
southern
louisiana
1.
it
was
one
of
the
main
basis
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
southern
louisiana
2
and
of
course
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
case,
the
court
of
appeals
at
d.c.
disagreed
and
said
we
are
past
the
experimental
stage
now
and
you
cannot
get
by
with
that
sort
of
thing
by
calling
it
experimental.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
they
were
dealing
with
an
almost
identical
record,
your
honor,
the
same
issues.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
not
the
same
numbers,
but
certainly
the
same
issues,
the
same
type
of
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
the
same
settlement.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
the
68
record?
mr.
george
e.
morrow
your
honor,
it
was
using
that
for
the
purpose
of
excusing
some
very
loose
findings
on
the
part
of
the
federal
power
commission.
in
the
first
southern
louisiana
case,
the
court
said
“we
are
not
going
to
let
the
federal
power
commission
get
by
with
basing
its
conclusions
on
such
loose
findings
and
basing
findings
on
such
big
and
general
factual
allegations
in
the
future,
particularly
non-cost
findings.”
in
the
future,
if
the
commission
wants
to
put
non-cost
additives
onto
a
rate
of
return,
onto
a
rate,
it’s
got
to
show
what
those
additives,
how
much
they
are
needed,
and
what
they
will
accomplish.
and
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
case
reversed
the
commission
for
because
it
had
not
shown
just
exactly
that,
that
the
non
cost
additives
were
worth
what
they
cost
in
effect.
but
your
honor,
you
asked
what
--
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
first
case
have
decided
and
let
me
read
it
to
you.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
your
honor,
this
is
in
the
first
case
and
it’s
not
in
the
record
here,
i
happen
to
have
a
record
of
the
first
case
and
--
sir?
mr.
george
e.
morrow
the
court
said,
since
we
have
concluded
that
the
commission
is
on
the
right
course
now,
our
best
course
is
to
keep
within
the
proper
sphere
of
a
reviewing
court.
the
point
is
that
the
probability
of
shortage
based
on
new
evidence
is
not
before
us
for
review.
all
that
is
before
us
is
the
legal
adequacy
and
not
the
wisdom
of
the
commission’s
orders.
finally
and
most
importantly
in
the
light
of
permian,
we
think
we
are
required
to
hold
that
the
commission’s
orders
in
this
case
are
procedurally
and
substantively
adequate
under
the
law.
whether
they
are
ultimately
wise
is
a
question
to
be
presented
not
to
the
court,
but
to
the
commission
and
again
in
the
later
page
which
i
don’t
see
right
now,
it
says
we
hold
that
permian
requires
affirmance
and
then
on
its
opinion
on
rehearing,
it
reiterated
this
is
an
affirmance
and
not
a
remand.
so
what
happened
was,
and
incidentally
this
is
the
sole
basis
on
which
the
commission
now
rests
its
case.
if
this
order
in
southern
louisiana
1,
the
court
of
appeals
is
not
valid,
then
the
whole
defense
of
the
commission
of
its
refund
orders
must
collapse.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
i
am
looking
in
the
appendices
--
mr.
george
e.
morrow
alright,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
sir?
mr.
george
e.
morrow
if
it
had
not
been
a
final
order
then
i
presume
it
would
not
have
been
a
final
order
your
honor
that’s
correct.
but
this
was
a
final
order
and
the
commission
defended
it
before
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
final
order
and
successfully
defended
every
single
finding
in
that
case.
now
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
first
to
affirm,
because
it
says
we
have
to
affirm.
the
commission’s
opinion
is
based
solidly
on
evidence
in
the
record
and
we
have
no
choice,
but
to
affirm.
it
then
went
on
to
say
that
with
respect
to
this
lawful
order,
we
make,
it
says
we
rely
upon
the
broad
remedial
powers
that
in
here
in
the
court
of
equity
and
for
acting
pursuant
to
its
equitable
powers
stated,
we
make
it
part
of
the
remedy
in
this
case
that
the
authority
of
the
commission
to
reopen
any
part
of
its
orders
is
left
intact.
now
our
position
is
very
simply,
that
if
the
commission
order
was
lawful
in
all
respects,
there
was
no
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
provide
a
remedy,
a
judicial
equitable
remedy
for
a
perfectly
lawful
order.
once
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
commission
order
was
substantially
supported
by
facts
and
findings
in
the
record,
its
jurisdiction
was
at
an
end
with
respect
to
that
order
and
this
court
said
so
in
natural
gas
pipeline
versus
f.p.c.
which
is
cited
in
our
reply
brief.
the
court
said
this,
referring
to
the
court’s
review
of
the
commission
order,
“once
a
fair
hearing
has
been
given,
proper
findings
made
and
other
statutory
requirements
satisfied
the
courts
can
not
intervene,
in
the
absence
of
a
clear
showing
that
the
limits
of
due
process
have
been
overstepped.”
and
again
this
court,
in
sec
versus
chenery
corporation
said
that
it’s
the
duty
of
a
reviewing
court,
that
the
duty
of
a
reviewing
court
“is
that
an
end
when
it
becomes
evident
that
the
commission’s
action
is
based
upon
substantial
evidence
and
is
consistent
with
the
authority
granted
by
congress.”
this
is
the
crucial
distinction
between
this
case
and
the
ford
motor
case
and
all
the
other
cases
that
are
cited
along
that
line
by
the
commission
and
the
intervenors
in
this
case.
in
the
ford
motor
case,
the
agency
had
committed
legal
error.
someone’s
rights
had
been
violated.
a
wrong,
a
legal
wrong
had
been
perpetrated
and
this
called
upon
the
equity
powers
of
the
court,
the
remedial
powers
of
the
court
to
provide
a
remedy
for
the
wrong,
to
provide
relief
for
someone
who
had
received
legal
injury.
in
the
present
case
or
rather
in
southern
louisiana
1,
there
was
no
legal
wrong.
the
commission’s
opinion
was
affirmed
in
all
respects
upon
the
special
request
of
the
commission,
and
therefore,
the
court
had
no
power
under
the
natural
gas
act,
as
part
of
its
reviewing
power
under
the
natural
gas
act,
it
had
no
power
to
go
ahead
and
provide
a
legal
equitable
remedy,
judicial
equitable
remedy
for
a
perfectly
lawful
order.
but
if
the
commission
had
no
power
to
change
that
order
which
was
perfectly
lawful,
then
it
certainly
had
no
power
to
use
its
equitable
remedial
rights
to
invest
such
an
unprecedented
power
in
the
federal
power
commission.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
sir.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
that’s
correct.
that’s
what
the
court
purported
to
do
and
it’s
our
position
that
the
court
simply
could
not
do
both.
it
cannot
affirm
and
at
the
same
time
provide
a
judicial
equitable
remedy
for
perfectly
valid
order
and
that
is
what
it
purported
to
do
in
this
case.
now
there
is
--
the
new
york
commission
emphasizes
this
point
that
in
that
southern
louisiana
1,
the
court
had
carefully
and
exhaustively
reviewed
every
single
fact
finding
of
the
commission
and
it
had
affirmed
every
fact
finding
of
the
commission.
and
regardless
of
how
you
construe
the
commission’s
final
order
in
the
case,
it
is
not
reasonable
to
construe
it
as
having
the
court
say
we
just
reviewed
all
of
these
facts
and
costs,
we
affirm
them
all,
now
federal
commission
go
and
change
them.
in
other
words,
if
the
court
was
leaving
anything
open
validly
in
the
southern
louisiana
1
case,
it
was
leaving
open
matters
with
respect
to
non-cost
additives.
but
that
brings
us
to
the
second
leg
of
our
case,
of
our
position
here,
and
that
is
that
even
if
the
commission’s
reopening
of
its
1968
opinion
were
lawful,
the
manner
in
which
it
did
so
is
totally,
totally
unsupported
on
the
record.
this
is
not
just
a
matter
of
conflicting
findings.
this
is
a
matter
of
a
mis-analysis
of
the
facts.
the
sole
basis
upon
which
the
commission
made
its
change
in
the
1968
refund
order
was
on
its
finding
in
the
1971
case
that
it
had
committed
error,
factual
error
in
the
previous
case.
the
commission
said,
opinion
546
did
not
afford
an
adequate
return
and
it
understated
the
requirements
for
exploration
and
development.
in
the
light
of
these
inadequacies,
the
commission
said,
we
find
that
the
rights
of
20.625
cents
and
21
and
a
quarter
cents
as
a
based
for
refunds
are
reasonable
and
in
the
public
interest.
so
the
only
basis
for
the
finding
as
to
the
refunds
was
that
the
1968
order
was
in
error
with
respect
to
rate
of
return
and
allocation
of
exploration
and
development
costs.
the
rate
of
--
but
the
court
--
the
fallacy
here
is
that
the
commission
never
reviewed
its
1968
record.
it
never
went
back
to
determine
whether
the
fact
findings
in
that
record
were
wrong.
what
it
did
was
to
use
its
findings
in
the
new
case,
its
rate
of
return
based
on
the
1971
decision
and
using
the
economic
conditions
and
the
capital
conditions
of
the
1971
decision,
defined
the
of
rate
of
return
there
and
it
took
that
rate
of
return
and
said
because
this
is
higher,
this
is
13
to
16%,
therefore,
we
find
that
the
12%
rate
of
return
that
we
ordered
in
the
1968
opinion
is
inadequate.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
the
rate
of
return
in
the
second
case
is
no
evidence
as
to
the
inadequacy
of
the
rate
of
return
in
the
first
case.
the
same
thing
is
true
with
the
other
cost
element
which
is
a
major
cost
element.
the
allocation
of
costs
is
between
a
dry
hole
cost
or
exploration
and
development
costs
between
oil
and
gas.
it
used
a
new
method
in
southern
louisiana
2,
but
it
never
applied
that
method
to
the
costs
in
southern
louisiana
1.
so
regardless
of
the
result
that
it
reached
in
southern
louisiana
2,
it
could
not
use
that
result
as
evidence
that
it
had
been
wrong,
erroneous
or
inadequate
in
southern
louisiana
1.
so
there
was
no
evidence
to
support
the
court,
the
commission’s
changing
of
its
rates
in
the
earlier
opinion,
and
therefore,
no
evidence
to
support
the
change
of
its
refunds
in
that
period.
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
get
into
the
escalation
provisions
which,
as
i
say
the
first
one-half
cent
escalation
provision
amounts
to
$400
million.
there
are
three
additional
escalation
measures.
now,
mobil
in
its
brief
has
discussed
in
great
detail
the
discriminatory
aspects
of
these.
i
only
want
to
say
this
about
them.
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
the
commission’s
opinion
to
support
them.
there
is
no
evidence
or
that
there
is
going
to
be
anything
like
that
kind
of
fact,
of
cost
increase
in
the
future.
this
gas
is
the
gas
that
has
already
been
found.
this
gas,
they
have
already
had
the
lease
costs,
the
dry
hole
cost,
the
drilling
cost,
all
of
the
costs
have
been
expended
in
the
past
except
the
cost
of
sitting
there
and
letting
the
gas
flow
from
the
well
bore
into
the
pipeline.
and
as
new
york
points
out
in
its
brief
those
cash
cost
actually
decreased
between
1968
and
1971
and
there
is
no
finding
in
the
future
that
those
costs
are
going
to
increase
in
any
perceptible
degree
and
no
conceivable
possibility
that
those
costs
will
increase
in
the
realm
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars,
as
is
involved
in
these
half-cent
increases.
the
commission
never
made
any
findings
as
to
how
much
good
these
half-cent
increases
were
going
to
do.
whether
they
were
needed,
in
the
first
place
and
if
they
were
needed,
there
was
no
balancing
of
the
hundreds
of
millions
of
costs
versus
the
probable
new
reserves
that
will
be
gotten
as
a
result
of
them.
so
this
is
what
disturbed
judge
leventhal
too.
judge
leventhal,
addressing
this
precise
issue
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
case
concluded
that
since
the
rates
for
new
gas
had
been
expressly
found
by
the
commission
to
be
adequate,
alone,
the
rates
for
new
gas
alone
and
to
induce
capital
investment
in
the
area,
there
was
no
basis
for
an
extra
allowance
to
rates
for
old
gas
to
accomplish
all
over
again
identically
the
same
thing.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
yes,
your
honor
if
i
may.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
thank
you
sir.
first,
with
respect
to
justice
brennan’s
question
about
the
standard
used
by
ca
five
in
reviewing
the
rate.
we
contend
that
they
used
the
wrong
standard
and
that
this
court
will
look
at
the
texas
gulf
coast
trade,
you’ll
find
the
exactly
the
right
standard
that
should
be
used.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
sir?
mr.
george
e.
morrow
no
sir,
one
of
them
is
wrong.
mr.
george
e.
morrow
that
case
used
of
virtually
identically
the
same
or
settlement
provision
that
this
case
has
used,
yes,
your
honor.
so
it
was
modeled
directly
after
this
case.
they
both
got
to
stand
afoul
it
seems
to
me
and
we
suggest
that
the
general
result
that
mr.
forquer
was
said
that
the
court
used
there,
what’s
the
general
overall
result,
that’s
not
the
proper
standard.
this
court
has
said
that
each
essential
element
of
the
cost
of
service
must
be
supported
by
evidence.
and
we
contend
that
it’s
not
in
this
case.
now,
as
to
the
matter
that
your
honor
raised
justice
white,
as
to
the
discretion
of
the
commission
to
order
refunds,
we
treated
that
right
strongly
in
our
reply
brief
and
would
commend
that
to
your
attention
because
we
take
the
position
that
the
commission
has
no
discretion
to
allow
a
company
to
remain
unjustly
enriched
by
unlawful
exactions
from
its
customers,
particularly
under
an
act
that’s
supposed
to
give
complete
permanent
and
effective
bond
of
protection
to
the
consumers.
as
to
the
compromise
--
as
to
the
$150
million
of
refunds,
i
must
take
issue
with
mr.
forquer
as
to
how
that
was
arrived
at.
it
was
pulled
right
square
out
of
the
air.
it
was
a
result
of
settlement
negotiations
and
after
that
$150
million
figure
had
been
reached,
then
the
commission
started
building
a
floor
of
cost
under
it
to
support
it.
and
it
couldn’t
find
the
cost
in
its
cost
of
service
to
support
that
reduction
to
a
$150
million
and
that’s
why
the
commission
went
back
to
1968
and
remodeled
its
1968
opinion
and
all
--
and
it
did
so
by
using
a
different
kind
of
cost
allocation
method
in
this
case.
the
cost
allegation
method
which
the
commission
used
in
this
case
was
one
it
had
rejected
in
every
other
case
it’s
ever
had
of
producers.
the
only
reason
that
this
cost
allocation
method
was
used
in
this
case
was
to
jack
up
retroactively
the
cost
in
southern
louisiana
1,
so
that
they
would
meet
this
package
deal
that
had
been
presented
to
the
commission.
if
it
please
the
court,
the
thing
that's
basically
wrong
with
this
case
is
that
we
have
a
serious
question
here,
a
serious
problem
and
the
commission
and
it
demands
a
rational
well
thought
out
result.
and
what
the
commission
has
done
has
abdicated
its
responsibility
to
a
kind
of
regulation
by
negotiation
by
the
industry
itself.
and
with
respect
to
the
refund
--
with
respect
to
the
whole
thing,
you
got
a
negotiation
between
selling
parties
who
are
the
producers
controlling
virtually
the
entire
supply
of
gas
in
southern
louisiana.
and
buying
parties,
the
pipelines
and
the
distributors
who
had
desperate
for
gas
must
to
get
it
from
these
producers
and
can
resell
it
at
any
rate
that
the
producers
proposed
to
sell
it
to
them
for
and
who
have
no
interest
in
the
refunds
whatsoever
because
as
mr.
rebman
pointed
out
the
pipelines
don’t
keep
them,
they
pass
them
along
to
the
distributors
and
the
distributors
do
not
keep
them
there,
the
state
regulatory
agencies
make
them
passed
along.
so
the
negotiations
that
resulted
in
this
$150
million
worth
of
refunds
were
by
people
who
were
negotiating
with
other
people’s
money.
and
that
is
how
they
got
down
to
the
$150
million.
thank
you,
your
honor.
