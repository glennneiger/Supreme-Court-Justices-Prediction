mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
argue
for
petitioner
mobil
oil
corporation
only.
there
are
differences
as
to
provision
and
result
sought
by
petitioners.
these
cases
come
from
the
fifth
circuit
and
arise
under
sections
4
and
5
of
the
national
gas
act
and
involve
rates
for
natural
gas
producers.
the
proceedings
before
the
commission
were
to
fix
such
rates
for
the
southern
louisiana
area,
both
on
shore
and
offshore,
an
area
that
now
supplies
approximately
one-third
of
the
nation’s
interstate
supply
of
natural
gas.
as
the
issues
reach
this
court,
the
subject
matter
involves
first,
a
fund
of
approximately
$375
million
which
were
amounts
collected
by
producers
in
the
area
prior
to
august
1,
1971.
the
case
also
involves
a
rate
structure
that
fixes
charges
to
be
made
by
producers
to
pipeline
purchases
of
something
in
excess
of
$1
billion
annually
for
each
of
the
years
after
august
1,
1971
and
under
a
rate
structure
that
extends
by
terms
to
1976
and
1977.
these
two
branches
of
the
case
became
intertwined
before
the
commission
and
the
background
lies
in
two
separate
area
rate
cases,
two
commission
opinions
and
now
two
opinions
by
the
fifth
circuit.
the
first
area
rate
case
for
southern
louisiana
was
initiated
in
1961.
this
led
to
what
is
denoted
commission
opinion
number
546
issued
in
1968
that
was
followed
by
review
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
opinions
that
are
referred
to
in
the
briefs
as
the
austral
case
or
southern
louisiana
1.
that
opinion
was
an
affirmance
of
opinion
number
546,
but
included
language
in
the
initial
opinion
and
in
a
later
opinion
by
the
fifth
circuit
denying
petitions
for
rehearing
that
give
rise
to
the
issues
that
are
raised
by
the
other
petitioners,
the
municipal
distributor
group
and
new
york
as
to
the
commission’s
power
thereafter
to
reopen
the
rates
fixed
by
that
opinion
and
to
revise
them.
those
questions
will
be
covered
by
mr.
morrow.
the
second
southern
louisiana
area
rate
case
produced
the
opinion
which
is
now
here,
denoted
commission
opinion
number
598.
this
proceeding
was
initiated
in
1969
before
review
of
the
first
opinion
had
been
completed.
at
first,
it
was
restricted
to
rates
for
new
contracts
for
new
sales
from
the
federal
offshore
domain
only.
later,
commission
orders
expanded
the
scope
of
the
proceeding
to
include
all
producer
sales
in
southern
louisiana
and
after
the
austral
decision
by
the
fifth
circuit,
the
commission
also
enlarged
the
docket
to
include
the
issues
of
revision
of
the
rates
that
had
been
fixed
by
the
first
opinion
and
to
include
the
issues
of
disposition
of
refund
liabilities
that
would
have
been
fixed
by
the
rates
in
the
commission’s
first
opinion.
the
proceeding
before
the
commission
was
before
a
hearing
examiner.
it
was
an
adjudicatory
type
hearing.
the
cost
data
in
the
records
are
essentially
the
1969
test
year.
there
are
two
major
types.
one
is
what
is
called
historical
cost
of
flowing
gas.
this
ultimately
became
the
cost
used
to
fixed
rates
for
contracts
dated
prior
to
october
1,
1968.
the
second
major
type
of
cost
is
the
so
called
current
cost.
this
ultimately
was
used
with
reference
to
rates
for
what
is
called
new
gas
and
in
this
case,
that
classification
is
gas
sold
on
the
contracts
dated
after
october
1,
1968.
there
was
other
extensive
evidence
of
economic,
financial,
supply
demand,
nature
of
the
type
that
this
court
reviewed
in
the
permian
case.
there
were
conferences
and
then
hearings
before
the
examiner,
beginning
in
1969
and
continuing
to
march
1971.
while
the
hearing
was
in
progress,
a
settlement
conference
was
initiated
under
the
commission’s
rules.
this
conference
is
held
off
the
record
and
all
parties
to
a
given
proceeding
are
invited
to
participate.
those
conferences
resulted
in
the
filing
of
a
motion
with
the
commission
by
a
group
of
distribution
companies
referred
to
in
the
briefs
here
as
united
distribution
companies
or
udc.
the
motion
was
submitted
november
1970,
asking
the
commission
to
approve
a
proposed
settlement
which
was
appended
to
the
motion.
the
commission
then
issued
notice
of
that
and
provided
for
the
filing
of
comments.
the
comments
indicated
very
wide
support
for
the
settlement
from
major
producers
in
the
area,
pipeline
purchasers,
distribution
companies
in
two
groups
and
some
state
commissions.
however,
the
settlement
was
opposed
by
mobil
by
another
major
producer
in
the
area,
in
some
small
details
by
other
producers.
it
was
also
opposed
by
the
public
service
commission
for
the
state
of
new
york,
the
municipal
distributors,
the
american
public
gas
association,
the
american
public
power
association
and
the
consumer
federation
of
america.
on
december
24,
1970,
the
commission
issued
an
order
that
made
the
settlement
proposal
a
part
of
the
record
and
provided
that
opponents
could
present
in
the
hearings
that
were
still
going
on
before
the
hearing
examiner,
the
reasons
are
basis
for
their
objections.
this
hearing
continued
the
conclusion.
in
march
1971,
the
examiner’s
decision
was
omitted,
briefs
were
filed
directly
to
the
commission.
there
was
no
oral
argument
and
the
commission
issued
its
opinion
number
598,
the
opinion
now
here
on
july
16,
1971.
this
adopted
the
settlement
proposal
in
its
entirety.
it
has
specific
features
that
give
rise
to
the
issues
now
raised
here
by
mobil.
as
to
the
past,
that
is
this
fund
of
collections
prior
to
august
1,
1971,
the
commission
adopted
a
formula
set
out
on
the
settlement
proposal
to
dispose
refund
liabilities.
specific
rates
were
fixed
for
the
past
period.
amounts
collected
by
individual
producers
in
excess
of
those
rates
were
not
to
be
refunded,
but
were
to
be
retained
as
working
capital
and
subject
to
future
discharge
by
dedication
of
new
reserves
in
the
area.
as
to
the
future,
that
is
the
period
after
august
1,
1971,
the
commission
adopted
precisely
a
two-part
rate
structure
that
was
set
out
in
the
settlement.
rates
were
prescribed
for
flowing
gas
that
is
rates
for
--
sales
under
contracts
dated
prior
to
october
1,
1968,
a
fixed
escalation
in
october,
1973
was
provided
and
a
system
was
included
for
contingent
escalations
up
to
a
total
of
1.5
cents,
up
to
1977,
if
by
that
time
the
industry
as
a
whole
dedicates
certain
specified
quantities
of
new
gas
in
the
area.
but
on
one
of
the
points
we
raise
here,
that
contingent
escalation
formula
excludes
from
the
reserves
that
will
be
counted.
the
reserves
that
are
used
by
individual
companies
to
discharge
their
own
refund
liabilities
and
it
requires
those
of
us
such
as
mobil,
which
have
small
refund
liabilities
to
in
effect
earn
these
escalations
which
are
then
allowed
for
all
others.
the
rate
structure
also
includes
a
separate
rate
for
new
gas,
that
is
sales
on
the
contract
dated
after
october
1,
1968
and
a
moratorium
on
increases
in
rates
under
section
4
of
the
act,
extending
to
october
1,
1976
for
flowing
gas
and
october
1,
1977
for
the
new
gas.
other
provisions
that
we
have
raised
and
discussed
in
our
briefs
were
included,
precisely
as
set
out
in
the
settlement.
the
opponents
of
the
settlement
sought
rehearing
as
required
by
section
19
(a)
of
the
natural
gas
act.
this
was
denied
by
commission
opinion
598-a
in
which
the
commission
reiterated
that
it
adopted
this
settlement
proposal
in
its
entirety.
review
in
the
fifth
circuit
followed.
the
commission’s
opinion
was
affirmed.
in
august
1973,
however,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
reversed
the
commission
as
to
an
identical
rate
structure
which
the
commission
had
imposed
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
area,
finding
essential
elements
of
this
rate
structure
in
conflict
with
the
standards
of
sections
4
and
5
of
the
natural
gas
act.
the
proceedings
in
this
court
then
followed.
now
the
issue
is
raised
by
mobil
go
both
to
what
we
term
the
invalid
end
result,
impact
and
consequences,
in
this
case
under
the
standards
that
this
court
set
out
in
the
hope
test
in
1944
and
in
its
review
of
the
first
area
rate
case,
the
permian
basin
decision
in
1968.
the
issues
we
raise
also
go
to
the
invalidity
of
essential
elements
of
this
rate
structure.
in
our
view,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
opinion
which
is
before
this
court
is
correct.
this
structure
violates
express
standards
of
sections
4
and
5
of
the
natural
gas
act
which
prohibit
unjust
and
unreasonable
rates
and
also
prohibit
unduly
discriminatory
and
unduly
preferential
rate
structures.
in
addition,
as
our
briefs
indicate,
there
are
substantial
parts
of
the
commission’s
opinion
in
this
case
which
do
not
include
any
of
the
findings
that
this
court
indicated
in
both
hope
and
in
permian
are
required
for
valid
rates
under
the
natural
gas
act.
now
in
particulars
as
to
our
view
on
the
discriminatory
and
preferential
nature
of
this
rate
structure,
it
begins
with
this
treatment
of
refunds
for
the
past
period
and
it
carries
on
from
that
over
into
the
rates
prescribed
for
present
and
future.
by
the
treatment
of
refunds,
the
commission
has
in
effect
in
this
case,
adopted
a
rate
structure
which
prefers
the
producers
who
in
the
past
collected
the
highest
rates,
who
did
not
follow
commission
guidelines
and
policies
between
1960
and
1968,
it
provides
those
producers
additional
and
special
working
capital
available
in
the
present
and
in
the
future
for
use
in
competitive
bidding
and
other
operations
and
this
same
formula
is
tied
to
the
flowing
gas
rates
that
were
fixed
here
for
the
present
and
the
future.
we
cite
in
our
briefs
specific
parts
of
the
commission’s
opinion
which
reflect
that
the
commission
treated
its
present
and
future
allowance
for
exploration
and
development
capital
and
the
other
capital
allowances
in
the
flowing
gas
rates
as
in
part
satisfied
by
this
special
allowance
of
working
capital
to
the
few
producers
who
owed
the
large
refunds.
as
we
cited
in
our
brief,
they
are
quite
disproportionate.
they
do
not
or
not
proportional
among
producers
in
the
area
and
only
a
handful
of
the
producers
owe
the
bulk
of
the
refunds,
but
under
this
rate
structure,
both
as
to
past,
present
and
future,
the
incentives
and
the
benefits
the
commission
has
allowed
or
channeled
straight
to
those
three
producers
and
they
are
not
allowed
to
the
remaining
producers
in
the
area.
now
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
your
honor,
of
course
mr.
morrow
will
address
this
question
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
consumers,
but
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
opinion,
the
opinion
notes
that
this
is
adverse
both
to
the
interests
of
producers
in
the
area
who
are
old
producers
such
as
mobil
and
adverse
to
new
entrants
and
adverse
to
the
competitive
structure
in
the
area,
and
therefore,
would
be
adverse
to
the
ultimate
benefits
that
consumers
should
expect
in
the
sense
of
the
two
objectives
of
the
statute
which
are
reasonable
rates
and
an
adequate
supply.
now
the
analysis
of
that
in
the
texas
gulf
opinion,
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
quite
detailed.
we
rely
on
that
quite
heavily
and
i
think
it
does
cover
this
problem
which
we
raise
of
undue
discrimination
and
preference
both
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
affected
producer
and
from
the
view
point
of
the
ultimate
consumer
and
in
that
opinion,
the
basis
for
the
opinion
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
rested
of
course
on
the
statutory
standard,
but
on
the
adverse
impact
on
both
of
the
most
affected
interests.
now
in
the
analysis
of
this
rate
structure,
everything
for
present
and
future
that
we
attack
is
being
too
low
or
not
a
high
enough
reasonable
rate,
not
high
enough
current
allowance
at
1969
and
1971
cost.
everything
was
justified
all
along
the
way
by
ah
yes,
but
we
made
those
allowances
in
the
treatment
of
refunds.
but
then
when
you
look
at
that,
those
allowances
go
in
only
a
few
directions.
those
who
follow
the
past
policy
are
somewhat
left
out
in
the
cold
so
to
speak.
it
even
comes
in
the
opinion
before
the
fifth
circuit
on
the
moratorium.
in
the
permian
case,
this
court
spelled
out
certain
things
the
commission
should
find
when
it
imposes
a
moratorium
on
rate
increases
such
as
projected
stability
of
cost,
trends
as
to
rising
cost,
on
this
instance,
it
would
have
been
looking
towards
the
70s.
here
we
have
only
five
lines
in
the
commission
opinion
which
establish
a
moratorium
from
august
1971
to
1976
and
1977
in
one
of
the
nation’s
most
critical
areas.
there
is
not
one
word
in
those
five
lines
about
whether
cost
could
be
expected
to
rise,
whether
capital
requirements
would
be
greater
or
so
on
and
yet
the
fifth
circuit
opinion,
in
looking
at
our
objection
to
that
and
comparing
it
with
what
this
court
said
in
permian,
the
fifth
circuit
says
ah
yes
but
somehow
that
is
compensated
for
by
the
refund
allowances
that
were
permitted
under
this
rate
structure.
but
i
would
suggest
that
is
no
compensation
to
those
producers
who
did
not
collect
those
rates
in
the
past
and
it's
an
intermixture,
an
intertwined
effort
to
tie
together
a
rate
structure
to
protect
refund
liabilities
for
a
handful
of
companies,
but
in
so
doing,
the
commission
has
mixed
it
up
with
what
should
be
current
and
future
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
the
entire
area
industry.
it
has
used
that
also
to
lay
down
a
moratorium
on
the
whole
area
and
has
done
it
in
a
period
when
even
this
record
which
cut
off
in
1971
indicated
that
we
already
were
in
a
natural
gas
shortage.
it
indicated
that
the
heaviest
demands
for
capital
on
this
industry
that
have
ever
existed
would
arise
in
the
1970s
and
when
the
drilling
effort,
increasingly,
must
be
directed
toward
greater
offshore
distances,
deeper
drilling
and
so
on.
now
with
that,
we
have
the
commission
simply
adopting
a
rate
structure
that
in
our
view
was
tailor-made
to
benefit
only
a
handful
of
people
who
had
collected
as
we
say
the
highest
rates
from
1960
to
1968.
there
are
other
issues
that
we
have
raised
that
deal
with
particular
parts
of
the
settlement
agreement,
one
of
them
i
have
mentioned,
the
moratorium.
we
also
have
brought
the
question
of
the
commission’s
refusal
to
make
an
adequate
allowance
for
our
royalty
payments.
in
southern
louisiana,
the
producer’s
payments
of
royalty
to
others,
including
governmental
institutions
are
some
16%
of
total
revenues
and
the
commission
has
put
together
a
rate
structure
here
that
(a)
it
was
based
on
an
assumption
years
ago
that
its
own
rate
jurisdiction
extended
to
control
of
the
level
of
royalty
payment.
that
assumption
by
the
commission
some
years
ago
was
held
to
be
invalid
and
yet
the
commission
still
is
prescribing
rates
on
the
assumption
that
the
royalty
payment
is
controlled
or
a
function
of
the
rate
fixed
by
the
commission.
we
have
submitted
that
the
commission
erred
in
not
allowing
an
adjustment
pause
in
the
rates
where
if
the
producer
is
required
to
pay
government
or
someone
on
market
value
that
that
escalation
be
permitted.
thank
you.
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
argue
for
petitioner
mobil
oil
corporation
only.
there
are
differences
as
to
provision
and
result
sought
by
petitioners.
these
cases
come
from
the
fifth
circuit
and
arise
under
sections
4
and
5
of
the
national
gas
act
and
involve
rates
for
natural
gas
producers.
the
proceedings
before
the
commission
were
to
fix
such
rates
for
the
southern
louisiana
area,
both
on
shore
and
offshore,
an
area
that
now
supplies
approximately
one-third
of
the
nation’s
interstate
supply
of
natural
gas.
as
the
issues
reach
this
court,
the
subject
matter
involves
first,
a
fund
of
approximately
$375
million
which
were
amounts
collected
by
producers
in
the
area
prior
to
august
1,
1971.
the
case
also
involves
a
rate
structure
that
fixes
charges
to
be
made
by
producers
to
pipeline
purchases
of
something
in
excess
of
$1
billion
annually
for
each
of
the
years
after
august
1,
1971
and
under
a
rate
structure
that
extends
by
terms
to
1976
and
1977.
these
two
branches
of
the
case
became
intertwined
before
the
commission
and
the
background
lies
in
two
separate
area
rate
cases,
two
commission
opinions
and
now
two
opinions
by
the
fifth
circuit.
the
first
area
rate
case
for
southern
louisiana
was
initiated
in
1961.
this
led
to
what
is
denoted
commission
opinion
number
546
issued
in
1968
that
was
followed
by
review
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
opinions
that
are
referred
to
in
the
briefs
as
the
austral
case
or
southern
louisiana
1.
that
opinion
was
an
affirmance
of
opinion
number
546,
but
included
language
in
the
initial
opinion
and
in
a
later
opinion
by
the
fifth
circuit
denying
petitions
for
rehearing
that
give
rise
to
the
issues
that
are
raised
by
the
other
petitioners,
the
municipal
distributor
group
and
new
york
as
to
the
commission’s
power
thereafter
to
reopen
the
rates
fixed
by
that
opinion
and
to
revise
them.
those
questions
will
be
covered
by
mr.
morrow.
the
second
southern
louisiana
area
rate
case
produced
the
opinion
which
is
now
here,
denoted
commission
opinion
number
598.
this
proceeding
was
initiated
in
1969
before
review
of
the
first
opinion
had
been
completed.
at
first,
it
was
restricted
to
rates
for
new
contracts
for
new
sales
from
the
federal
offshore
domain
only.
later,
commission
orders
expanded
the
scope
of
the
proceeding
to
include
all
producer
sales
in
southern
louisiana
and
after
the
austral
decision
by
the
fifth
circuit,
the
commission
also
enlarged
the
docket
to
include
the
issues
of
revision
of
the
rates
that
had
been
fixed
by
the
first
opinion
and
to
include
the
issues
of
disposition
of
refund
liabilities
that
would
have
been
fixed
by
the
rates
in
the
commission’s
first
opinion.
the
proceeding
before
the
commission
was
before
a
hearing
examiner.
it
was
an
adjudicatory
type
hearing.
the
cost
data
in
the
records
are
essentially
the
1969
test
year.
there
are
two
major
types.
one
is
what
is
called
historical
cost
of
flowing
gas.
this
ultimately
became
the
cost
used
to
fixed
rates
for
contracts
dated
prior
to
october
1,
1968.
the
second
major
type
of
cost
is
the
so
called
current
cost.
this
ultimately
was
used
with
reference
to
rates
for
what
is
called
new
gas
and
in
this
case,
that
classification
is
gas
sold
on
the
contracts
dated
after
october
1,
1968.
there
was
other
extensive
evidence
of
economic,
financial,
supply
demand,
nature
of
the
type
that
this
court
reviewed
in
the
permian
case.
there
were
conferences
and
then
hearings
before
the
examiner,
beginning
in
1969
and
continuing
to
march
1971.
while
the
hearing
was
in
progress,
a
settlement
conference
was
initiated
under
the
commission’s
rules.
this
conference
is
held
off
the
record
and
all
parties
to
a
given
proceeding
are
invited
to
participate.
those
conferences
resulted
in
the
filing
of
a
motion
with
the
commission
by
a
group
of
distribution
companies
referred
to
in
the
briefs
here
as
united
distribution
companies
or
udc.
the
motion
was
submitted
november
1970,
asking
the
commission
to
approve
a
proposed
settlement
which
was
appended
to
the
motion.
the
commission
then
issued
notice
of
that
and
provided
for
the
filing
of
comments.
the
comments
indicated
very
wide
support
for
the
settlement
from
major
producers
in
the
area,
pipeline
purchasers,
distribution
companies
in
two
groups
and
some
state
commissions.
however,
the
settlement
was
opposed
by
mobil
by
another
major
producer
in
the
area,
in
some
small
details
by
other
producers.
it
was
also
opposed
by
the
public
service
commission
for
the
state
of
new
york,
the
municipal
distributors,
the
american
public
gas
association,
the
american
public
power
association
and
the
consumer
federation
of
america.
on
december
24,
1970,
the
commission
issued
an
order
that
made
the
settlement
proposal
a
part
of
the
record
and
provided
that
opponents
could
present
in
the
hearings
that
were
still
going
on
before
the
hearing
examiner,
the
reasons
are
basis
for
their
objections.
this
hearing
continued
the
conclusion.
in
march
1971,
the
examiner’s
decision
was
omitted,
briefs
were
filed
directly
to
the
commission.
there
was
no
oral
argument
and
the
commission
issued
its
opinion
number
598,
the
opinion
now
here
on
july
16,
1971.
this
adopted
the
settlement
proposal
in
its
entirety.
it
has
specific
features
that
give
rise
to
the
issues
now
raised
here
by
mobil.
as
to
the
past,
that
is
this
fund
of
collections
prior
to
august
1,
1971,
the
commission
adopted
a
formula
set
out
on
the
settlement
proposal
to
dispose
refund
liabilities.
specific
rates
were
fixed
for
the
past
period.
amounts
collected
by
individual
producers
in
excess
of
those
rates
were
not
to
be
refunded,
but
were
to
be
retained
as
working
capital
and
subject
to
future
discharge
by
dedication
of
new
reserves
in
the
area.
as
to
the
future,
that
is
the
period
after
august
1,
1971,
the
commission
adopted
precisely
a
two-part
rate
structure
that
was
set
out
in
the
settlement.
rates
were
prescribed
for
flowing
gas
that
is
rates
for
--
sales
under
contracts
dated
prior
to
october
1,
1968,
a
fixed
escalation
in
october,
1973
was
provided
and
a
system
was
included
for
contingent
escalations
up
to
a
total
of
1.5
cents,
up
to
1977,
if
by
that
time
the
industry
as
a
whole
dedicates
certain
specified
quantities
of
new
gas
in
the
area.
but
on
one
of
the
points
we
raise
here,
that
contingent
escalation
formula
excludes
from
the
reserves
that
will
be
counted.
the
reserves
that
are
used
by
individual
companies
to
discharge
their
own
refund
liabilities
and
it
requires
those
of
us
such
as
mobil,
which
have
small
refund
liabilities
to
in
effect
earn
these
escalations
which
are
then
allowed
for
all
others.
the
rate
structure
also
includes
a
separate
rate
for
new
gas,
that
is
sales
on
the
contract
dated
after
october
1,
1968
and
a
moratorium
on
increases
in
rates
under
section
4
of
the
act,
extending
to
october
1,
1976
for
flowing
gas
and
october
1,
1977
for
the
new
gas.
other
provisions
that
we
have
raised
and
discussed
in
our
briefs
were
included,
precisely
as
set
out
in
the
settlement.
the
opponents
of
the
settlement
sought
rehearing
as
required
by
section
19
(a)
of
the
natural
gas
act.
this
was
denied
by
commission
opinion
598-a
in
which
the
commission
reiterated
that
it
adopted
this
settlement
proposal
in
its
entirety.
review
in
the
fifth
circuit
followed.
the
commission’s
opinion
was
affirmed.
in
august
1973,
however,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
reversed
the
commission
as
to
an
identical
rate
structure
which
the
commission
had
imposed
in
the
texas
gulf
coast
area,
finding
essential
elements
of
this
rate
structure
in
conflict
with
the
standards
of
sections
4
and
5
of
the
natural
gas
act.
the
proceedings
in
this
court
then
followed.
now
the
issue
is
raised
by
mobil
go
both
to
what
we
term
the
invalid
end
result,
impact
and
consequences,
in
this
case
under
the
standards
that
this
court
set
out
in
the
hope
test
in
1944
and
in
its
review
of
the
first
area
rate
case,
the
permian
basin
decision
in
1968.
the
issues
we
raise
also
go
to
the
invalidity
of
essential
elements
of
this
rate
structure.
in
our
view,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
opinion
which
is
before
this
court
is
correct.
this
structure
violates
express
standards
of
sections
4
and
5
of
the
natural
gas
act
which
prohibit
unjust
and
unreasonable
rates
and
also
prohibit
unduly
discriminatory
and
unduly
preferential
rate
structures.
in
addition,
as
our
briefs
indicate,
there
are
substantial
parts
of
the
commission’s
opinion
in
this
case
which
do
not
include
any
of
the
findings
that
this
court
indicated
in
both
hope
and
in
permian
are
required
for
valid
rates
under
the
natural
gas
act.
now
in
particulars
as
to
our
view
on
the
discriminatory
and
preferential
nature
of
this
rate
structure,
it
begins
with
this
treatment
of
refunds
for
the
past
period
and
it
carries
on
from
that
over
into
the
rates
prescribed
for
present
and
future.
by
the
treatment
of
refunds,
the
commission
has
in
effect
in
this
case,
adopted
a
rate
structure
which
prefers
the
producers
who
in
the
past
collected
the
highest
rates,
who
did
not
follow
commission
guidelines
and
policies
between
1960
and
1968,
it
provides
those
producers
additional
and
special
working
capital
available
in
the
present
and
in
the
future
for
use
in
competitive
bidding
and
other
operations
and
this
same
formula
is
tied
to
the
flowing
gas
rates
that
were
fixed
here
for
the
present
and
the
future.
we
cite
in
our
briefs
specific
parts
of
the
commission’s
opinion
which
reflect
that
the
commission
treated
its
present
and
future
allowance
for
exploration
and
development
capital
and
the
other
capital
allowances
in
the
flowing
gas
rates
as
in
part
satisfied
by
this
special
allowance
of
working
capital
to
the
few
producers
who
owed
the
large
refunds.
as
we
cited
in
our
brief,
they
are
quite
disproportionate.
they
do
not
or
not
proportional
among
producers
in
the
area
and
only
a
handful
of
the
producers
owe
the
bulk
of
the
refunds,
but
under
this
rate
structure,
both
as
to
past,
present
and
future,
the
incentives
and
the
benefits
the
commission
has
allowed
or
channeled
straight
to
those
three
producers
and
they
are
not
allowed
to
the
remaining
producers
in
the
area.
now
--
mr.
carroll
l.
gilliam
your
honor,
of
course
mr.
morrow
will
address
this
question
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
consumers,
but
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
opinion,
the
opinion
notes
that
this
is
adverse
both
to
the
interests
of
producers
in
the
area
who
are
old
producers
such
as
mobil
and
adverse
to
new
entrants
and
adverse
to
the
competitive
structure
in
the
area,
and
therefore,
would
be
adverse
to
the
ultimate
benefits
that
consumers
should
expect
in
the
sense
of
the
two
objectives
of
the
statute
which
are
reasonable
rates
and
an
adequate
supply.
now
the
analysis
of
that
in
the
texas
gulf
opinion,
from
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
is
quite
detailed.
we
rely
on
that
quite
heavily
and
i
think
it
does
cover
this
problem
which
we
raise
of
undue
discrimination
and
preference
both
from
the
viewpoint
of
the
affected
producer
and
from
the
view
point
of
the
ultimate
consumer
and
in
that
opinion,
the
basis
for
the
opinion
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
rested
of
course
on
the
statutory
standard,
but
on
the
adverse
impact
on
both
of
the
most
affected
interests.
now
in
the
analysis
of
this
rate
structure,
everything
for
present
and
future
that
we
attack
is
being
too
low
or
not
a
high
enough
reasonable
rate,
not
high
enough
current
allowance
at
1969
and
1971
cost.
everything
was
justified
all
along
the
way
by
ah
yes,
but
we
made
those
allowances
in
the
treatment
of
refunds.
but
then
when
you
look
at
that,
those
allowances
go
in
only
a
few
directions.
those
who
follow
the
past
policy
are
somewhat
left
out
in
the
cold
so
to
speak.
it
even
comes
in
the
opinion
before
the
fifth
circuit
on
the
moratorium.
in
the
permian
case,
this
court
spelled
out
certain
things
the
commission
should
find
when
it
imposes
a
moratorium
on
rate
increases
such
as
projected
stability
of
cost,
trends
as
to
rising
cost,
on
this
instance,
it
would
have
been
looking
towards
the
70s.
here
we
have
only
five
lines
in
the
commission
opinion
which
establish
a
moratorium
from
august
1971
to
1976
and
1977
in
one
of
the
nation’s
most
critical
areas.
there
is
not
one
word
in
those
five
lines
about
whether
cost
could
be
expected
to
rise,
whether
capital
requirements
would
be
greater
or
so
on
and
yet
the
fifth
circuit
opinion,
in
looking
at
our
objection
to
that
and
comparing
it
with
what
this
court
said
in
permian,
the
fifth
circuit
says
ah
yes
but
somehow
that
is
compensated
for
by
the
refund
allowances
that
were
permitted
under
this
rate
structure.
but
i
would
suggest
that
is
no
compensation
to
those
producers
who
did
not
collect
those
rates
in
the
past
and
it's
an
intermixture,
an
intertwined
effort
to
tie
together
a
rate
structure
to
protect
refund
liabilities
for
a
handful
of
companies,
but
in
so
doing,
the
commission
has
mixed
it
up
with
what
should
be
current
and
future
just
and
reasonable
rates
for
the
entire
area
industry.
it
has
used
that
also
to
lay
down
a
moratorium
on
the
whole
area
and
has
done
it
in
a
period
when
even
this
record
which
cut
off
in
1971
indicated
that
we
already
were
in
a
natural
gas
shortage.
it
indicated
that
the
heaviest
demands
for
capital
on
this
industry
that
have
ever
existed
would
arise
in
the
1970s
and
when
the
drilling
effort,
increasingly,
must
be
directed
toward
greater
offshore
distances,
deeper
drilling
and
so
on.
now
with
that,
we
have
the
commission
simply
adopting
a
rate
structure
that
in
our
view
was
tailor-made
to
benefit
only
a
handful
of
people
who
had
collected
as
we
say
the
highest
rates
from
1960
to
1968.
there
are
other
issues
that
we
have
raised
that
deal
with
particular
parts
of
the
settlement
agreement,
one
of
them
i
have
mentioned,
the
moratorium.
we
also
have
brought
the
question
of
the
commission’s
refusal
to
make
an
adequate
allowance
for
our
royalty
payments.
in
southern
louisiana,
the
producer’s
payments
of
royalty
to
others,
including
governmental
institutions
are
some
16%
of
total
revenues
and
the
commission
has
put
together
a
rate
structure
here
that
(a)
it
was
based
on
an
assumption
years
ago
that
its
own
rate
jurisdiction
extended
to
control
of
the
level
of
royalty
payment.
that
assumption
by
the
commission
some
years
ago
was
held
to
be
invalid
and
yet
the
commission
still
is
prescribing
rates
on
the
assumption
that
the
royalty
payment
is
controlled
or
a
function
of
the
rate
fixed
by
the
commission.
we
have
submitted
that
the
commission
erred
in
not
allowing
an
adjustment
pause
in
the
rates
where
if
the
producer
is
required
to
pay
government
or
someone
on
market
value
that
that
escalation
be
permitted.
thank
you.
