justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
unsworn
statement
by
the
defendant
comes
after
the
closing
argument
of
counsel
in
massachusetts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
did
it
this
time?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
isn’t
a
unique
failing
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
is
not
unique
in
the
experience
of
trying
a
case
that
something
you
saying
in
your
opening
statement.
you
turn
out
that
you
cannot
prove.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
opponent
contends
as
i
understand
it
that
court
adjourned
rather
suddenly
after
the
argument
in
the
afternoon
that
he
really
didn’t
have
an
opportunity
to
make
the
request
to
the
trial
judge
until
the
next
morning.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
lobby
conference,
the
massachusetts
equivalent
of
incumbents
and
chambers?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
mr.
smith,
why
was
the
court
of
appeals
able
to
reach
that
conclusion
as
empathetically
as
it
did
on
the
basis
of
a
statement,
they
hope
that
you
find
him
not
guilty.
i
quite
frankly
thank
that
they
hope
that
you
find
him
guilty
of
something
a
little
less
than
first-degree
murder.
there
is
no
reference
in
the
prosecutor’s
comment
to
anything
about
a
plea.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
to
the
words
used
weren’t
that
he
sought
some,
then
you
find
him
guilty
of
something
a
little
less
than
first-degree
murder.
why
isn’t
that
fair
inference
from
that
--
what
you
as
his
attorney
want?
you
said
you
want
on
a
verdict
that
acquittal
but
really,
you’d
be
damn
happy
to
get
a
verdict
of
second-degree
murder?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
have.
but,
why
isn’t
that
the
fair
inference
from
the
prosecutor
state?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
i
know
that
from
the
record
that
both
of
them
pleaded
guilty
the
second-degree
murder.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
he
said
was
that
they
hope
that
you
find
him
guilty
of
something
a
little
he
did
not
say
anything
about
a
plea.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
defense
attorney
opens
the
closing
arguments?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
the
prosecutor
responds
then
do
you
have
a
right
to
rebut?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
comes
before
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
respondent
donnelly
was
tried
in
massachusetts
state
court
for
first
degree
murder.
during
the
course
of
his
trial,
one
of
donnelly's
co-defendants
elected
to
plead
guilty
to
a
lesser
charge
and
the
trial
judge
advised
the
jury
that
he
had
pleaded
guilty.
respondent's
trial
then
continued.
in
the
closing
argument,
the
prosecutor
made
a
statement
which
respondent
has
contended
denied
him
due
process
of
law.
the
prosecutor
said
they,
meaning
respondent
and
his
00:43
said
that
they
hope
you
find
them
not
guilty.
i
quite
frankly
think
that
they
hope
you
find
him
guilty
of
something
a
little
less
than
first
degree
murder.
the
court
upon
request
gave
specific
instructions
to
disregard
this
statement.
respondent
was
convicted
by
the
jury
and
his
conviction
was
affirmed
on
appeal
by
the
massachusetts
courts.
respondent
then
sought
habeas
corpus
relief
in
the
united
states
district
court
where
the
writ
was
denied.
he
appealed
to
the
first
circuit
which
reversed.
that
court
reasoned
that
the
prosecutor’s
remarks
when
combined
with
the
guilty
plea
of
respondents
co-defendant,
would
probably
have
conveyed
to
the
jury
a
notion
that
respondent
had
also
sought
to
enter
guilty
plea,
but
he
had
been
refused.
to
create
this
impression,
said
the
court
was
a
denial
of
due
process.
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
although
the
prosecutor’s
remark
was
considered
improper
by
all
the
courts
which
passed
upon
it,
we
don't
believe
that
this
single,
somewhat
ambiguous
statement
when
viewed
in
the
context
of
the
entire
trial
and
particularly
the
instruction
from
the
trial
judge
that
the
statement
was
unsupported
by
any
evidence
in
the
record
and
should
be
disregarded,
denied
the
respondent
due
process
of
law.
