mr.
paul
t.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
involving
an
affirmative
falsity
of
a
prosecutor
statements
and
not
a
case
of
a
procedural
error
arising
from
a
technically
improper
argument
rectified
by
juror
of
instructions.
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
appendix
241,
we
have
before
as
a
case
with
a
prosecutor
despite
the
fact
that
was
wholly
and
true,
struggling
indicated
to
the
jury
that
the
defendant
had
offer
to
plea
guilty.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well
i
think
mr.
justice,
that
rational
of
the
court
my
argument
is
that
when
a
prosecutor
made
that
statement.
he
will
knew
at
that
time
that
the
respondent
have
not
sought
to
plead
guilty
to
any
offense.
he
also
well
knew
that
if
the
respondent
was
seeking
a
something
a
less
than
first-degree
murder.
you
could
have
had
it
for
the
asking
because
they
have
been
two
other
defendants,
oreto
and
gagliardi,
both
of
whom
have
pleaded
to
second-degree
murder
on
the
recommendation
of
the
same
prosecutor
and
had
been
given
life
sentences.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
i
would
not.
oh
no,
i
see.
it
mean
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
because
he
couldn’t
have
had
that
opinion
your
honor.
knowing
that
oreto
and
gagliardi
and
might
--
i
am
sure
mr.
mills
didn’t
contempt
to
mislead
the
court.
the
commonwealth
in
its
closing
argument
conceited
that
oreto
was
the
one
who
fired
one
shot
into
the
head
of
lanzi
the
deceased
and
that
gagliardi
have
fired
of
three
shots
into
his
side
and
consider
that
dechristoforo
had
never
fired
any
shots.
so
that
you
have
a
situation
where
the
two
triggerman;
gagliardi
and
oreto
where
allowed
to
plead
guilty
to
second-degree
murder
and
given
life
sentences.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
district
attorney
knew
that
and
as
they
saying
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
their
brief
and
i
think
the
petition
for
suit
at
page
25
in
their
brief
at
page
24
that
it
would
be
silly
to
argue
to
say
that
they
wouldn’t
have
given
dechristoforo
a
plea
to
second-degree
and
he
ask
for
it?
so
that
at
the
time
of
the
district
attorney
made
that
argument
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
he
knew
that
that
was
a
false
argument.
he
knew
that
we
would
looking
for
something
a
little
bit
less
because
we
could
of
got
a
little
bit
less
just
as
the
other
two.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
i
didn’t
know
of
read
anything
only
opinion
of
the
court
says
anything
about
plead
bargaining.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
or
there
was
a
stipulation.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
nothing
i
know
off.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
they
knew
that
gagliardi
to
plead
guilty.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
no.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
no,
no.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
that
he
is
seeking
something
less.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
i
think
the
conclusion
as
obvious
that
he
was
saying
to
the
jury
that
i
as
a
prosecutor
who
went
along
with
a
plea
of
guilty
for
gagliardi
at
the
evidence
than
in
before
that
jury.
that
gagliardi
had
shot
the
deceased
three
times
on
the
side.
that
i
as
a
prosecutor
having
agreed
and
recommended
to
the
court,
in
effect
that
the
court
accept
the
plea
of
guilty
to
second-degree
murder.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
i
beg
you,
pardon?
mr.
paul
t.
smith
that
so
your
honor.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
that
so.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
this
maybe
so
mr.
justice.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
i
beg
you,
pardon?
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
i
think
that
what
you
get
out
of
that
language
is
that
the
--
that
the
respondent
was
admitting
his
guilt.
if
he
was
seeking
sampling
a
little
less
than
first-degree
murder,
he
obviously
was
admitting
that
he
was
just
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
yes.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
but
mr.
justice,
that
wasn’t
the
case
here
by
way
of
the
very
stipulation.
the
respondents
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
yes.
but
stip
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
i
am
only
saying
that
the
stipulation
establishes
that
dechristoforo
had
never
sought
to
plead
guilty
to
any
offense
and
that
the
statement
by
the
prosecutor
knowing
that
he
had
never
sought
to
plead
guilty
to
any
offense.
and
knowing
also
that
dechristoforo
had
sought
to
plead
guilty,
he
could
of
have
it
for
asking
the
statement
by
the
prosecutor.
i
quite
frankly
think
that
they
hope
you
find
him
guilty
of
something
a
little
less
than
first-degree
murder
is
a
false
statement.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
that
is
correct
and
i
would
like
to
explain
what
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
i
--
yes
that
maybe
so
mr.
chief
justice
but
of
course
i
would
like
the
brief
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
i
think
that
mr.
mills
unwittingly
mislead
your
honor
in
answering
your
question
put
to
you,
put
to
him
by
you.
the
commonwealth
conceited
that
the
gun
that
was
found
on
the
seat
where
oreto
had
been
seated
had
been
fired
by
oreto
into
the
back
of
the
head
of
the
deceased
that
the
gun
that
was
laid
to
found
elsewhere
was
the
gun
that
had
been
used
by
gagliardi
to
fire
a
three
shots.
the
third
gun
that
was
found
in
there
was
a
derringer,
fully
loaded
had
not
been
used.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
there
was
evidence
that
oreto
had
worn
black
gloves,
black
silk
gloves
kidskin
gloves.
the
evidence
appeared
to
be
assuming
that
there
was
no
evidence
on
the
contrary
that
dechristoforo
had
no
gloves.
there
were
no
fingerprints
on
the
derringer
which
was
found
and
which
was
fully
loaded
in
the
back
of
the
car.
now,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
prosecutor
could
have
had
an
honest
opinion
and
saying
oh,
i
do
not
know
what
they
want.
i
think
that
what
they
want
is
something
a
little
less
than
first-degree
murder.
i’d
submit
that
when
a
matter
is
within
the
personal
knowledge
of
the
speaker
that
qualifying
the
phrase
by
the
words
“i
think”
doesn’t
convert
a
falsehood
into
a
possible
truth
or
a
factual
statement
into
an
opinion.
now,
he
knew
the
prosecutor
was
speaking
of
a
factual
proposition.
he
knew
that
no
author,
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
plead
to
anything
in
the
case.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
but
he
is
--
mr.
justice,
he
is
testifying
from
his
knowledge,
that
jury
seating
there
has
a
right
to
believe
that
when
a
district
attorney
says
to
them
i
quite
frankly
believe
something
that
he
has
a
source
of
information
unknown
to
them,
not
in
the
record,
not
put
on
in
a
trial
of
the
case
that
as
a
district
attorney
he
knows
something.
and
when
he
says
“i
quite
frankly
believe”
and
knows
that
he
cannot
believe
that
but
he
says
this
to
a
jury,
i
think
that
a
jury
has
a
right
to
draw
the
conclusion
that
dechristoforo
made
some
overture
to
plead
guilty
to
something.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
under
the
massachusetts
law,
the
court
is
required
to
instruct
on
first-degree,
second-degree
and
manslaughter.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
i
think
you
want
further
than
that.
he
said
he
quite
frankly
believed
that
that’s
what
dechristoforo
want
to.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
because
it
isn’t
the
fact
and
he
knew
it
wasn’t
the
fact
and
stating
that
to
the
jury
obviously
is
a
statement
that
dechristoforo
has
indicated
that
he
is
guilty
of
something.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
this
was
a
case
of
joint
venture
charge.
all
during
the
whole
course
of
the
trial.
i
made
every
effort
to
get
the
commonwealth
to
conceive
that
if
that
gagliardi
had
fired
the
three
shots
that
oreto
had
fired
the
one
shot
and
that
dechristoforo
had
never
fired
any
shots.
they
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
yes,
surely,
if
he
had
been
engaged
in
a
joint
venture
here
and
i
argue
that
to
the
court
in
the
lobby
or
in
chambers
and
the
district
attorneys
said
that
he
would
not
agree
to
any
such
--
he
would
not
agree
to
that.
as
a
concuss,
we
had
to
try
this
case
on
the
theory
that
the
commonwealth
was
going
to
try
to
show
that
dechristoforo
had
fired
some
shots
here
and
it
wasn’t
until
after
my
closing
argument
when
the
prosecutor
made
his
closing
argument.
but
for
the
first
time,
he
conceited
and
he
said
to
the
jury
that
theory
of
commonwealth
cases
that
gagliardi
shot
three
times
in
the
side
and
that
oreto
shot
him
once
through
the
head.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
no,
your
honor.
we
have
no
right
to
rebut
and
that
position
is
that
when
the
prosecutor
made
this
statement,
he
was
on
affect
testifying.
we
had
no
right
to
cross
examine
him.
we
have
no
right
to
rebut
us
and
that
was
left
with
the
jury.
the
impression
was
clearly
left
that
dechristoforo
was
seeking
something
less
than
first-degree
murder
and
on
affect.
a
representation
that
jury,
that
he
the
prosecutor
had
reason
to
believe
that
because
he
quite
frankly
thought
that
pretty
so
and
as
a
consequence
that
dechristoforo
was
in
a
fact
confessing
to
the
crime
but
was
seeking
to
get
maybe
a
better
deal.
now,
i
submit
that
this
false
statement
and
it
is
false
and
it
wasn’t
simply
an
opinion,
it
was
on
an
unequivocal
statement
that
he
frankly
believed
a
better
that
he
couldn’t
possibly
frankly
believe
because
he
knew
right
along
that
there
was
that
we
will
go
into
trial
all
the
way
through
on
this
thing.
and
when
he
made
that
argument
which
the
petitioner
conceives
as
an
improper
argument,
i
say
it
reaches
the
constitutional
dimensions
and
that
we
would
deprive
to
do
processes
result.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
i
don’t
think
it
would
have
reached
the
dimensions
that
his
argument
made
into
that.
i
would
not
--
i
don’t
approve
of
that
type
of
an
argument
but
i
don’t
think
i
could
quarrel
with
that
to
the
extent
that
i
am
quarreling
of
this
argument.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
oh,
no.
no,
i
think
that’s
perfectly
proper
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do
think
that
had
he
said
that
the
evidence
or
the
argument
by
the
defense
counsel
is
such
as
to
lead
you
to
believe
that
this
is
all
your
case
of
manslaughter
which
of
course
it
couldn’t
be
in
assistance
because
it
was
a
joint
venture
and
this
was
a
first-degree
murder
case,
there
wasn’t
any
question
about
it.
it
was
a
joint
venture
and
if
he
was
guilty,
he
was
guilty
at
least
to
the
same
degree
as
the
others
who
actually
plead
to
guilty
to
the
second-degree
murder
and
i
do
not
see
how
they
could
have
been
on
manslaughter
unless
the
jury
get
where
he
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
it
is
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
yes,
it
does.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
frankly
i
wasn’t
thinking
of
those
terms
of
manslaughter
or
anything
else
and
certainly
by
the
very
fact
that
we
didn’t
make
any
attempt
to
negotiate
a
plea.
where
as
a
prosecutor
points
out
in
his
brief,
he
says
it
would
make
not
a
width
of
sense
to
refuse
to
give
dechristoforo
at
least
the
same
type
of
consideration
as
they
gave
to
the
triggerman
to
gagliardi
and
the
other
fellow.
to
get
back
to
you,
first
now
that
i
think
more
of,
but
that
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
so.
i
think
that
perhaps
in
a
trial
of
the
case,
an
advocate
does
have
in
mind
the
possibility
that
if
the
jury
is
going
to
come
in
with
the
guilty,
that
of
be
the
least
possible
degree
and
i
think
that
the
statement
as
you
put.
if
you
have
made
that
statement
of
the
jury,
i
don’t
think
that
be
any
quarrel.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
i
don’t
think
that
be
any
quarrel.
but
i
think
when
he
says
i
quite
frankly
believe
this.
i
quite
frankly
think
that
he
seeking
something
other
than
first-degree
murder.
i
think
that
a
jury
seating
there
has
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
knows
of
something
that
they
don’t
know
about
and
that
that
is
testimony
and
that
we
would
deprive
the
cause
of
the
right
of
confrontation
but
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
and
i
might
point
this
at
--
although
he
says
in
his
brief,
the
petitioners
saying
in
their
brief
that
it
doesn’t
make
or
would
of
sense
that
they
wouldn’t
have
offered
him
dechristoforo
something
lessen
first-degree
murder.
but
at
that
time
of
trials,
it
made
a
good
deal
of
sense
to
the
prosecutor
because
he
argued
to
the
jury
and
he
pointing
to
dechristoforo
more
than
anybody
else
i
think
he
is
more
reprehensible
than
the
other
two
combine
because
he
was
the
man
who
supposedly
he
was
the
friend
of
lanzi,
the
victim.
so
during
the
trial,
he
had
an
appeared
that
dechristoforo
was
the
real
bad
man
on
this
situation
that
the
two
triggermen
went
the
bad
fellows
and
so
that
the
posture
of
trial
was
that
he
wouldn’t
give
dechristoforo
a
plea
of
second-degree
except
a
plea
of
second-degree.
in
short,
he
and
any
compound
of
it
after
the
objection
was
made
to
the
argument
by
saying
to
the
jury
i
believe
that
there
is
no
doubt
on
this
case,
none
whatsoever.
now,
all
i
am
arguing
to
this
court
is
that
the
statement
made
by
the
prosecutor
goes
beyond
a
technical
error
in
arguing.
it
was
a
false
statement.
it
is
tons
amount
to
the
introduction
of
false
evidence
and
that
at
this
court
should
regard
it
in
the
same
fashion
that
has
regarded
of
the
alcorda
case,
napue,
miller
and
pate
giglio.
a
false
statement
made
by
the
prosecutor
which
had
at
least
created
an
impression
in
the
minds
of
the
jury
that
the
defendant
here
had
offer
to
plead
guilty
and
of
not.
i
just
like
that
false
by
saying
that
it
was
some
reference
to
provocation.
i
would
submit
that
that
is
a
suspicious
argument.
there
was
no
provocation.
we
have
seth
forth
in
our
brief
the
opening
and
the
fact
is
that
in
the
opening
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
a
lot
of
us
make
openings
which
we
can’t
this
is
severely
establish
but
virtually
every
manner
stated
in
the
opening
was
either
reproduce
an
evidence
or
there
was
a
proper
proof.
for
example,
i
offer
to
prove
that
dechristoforo
when
he
fled
and
fled
to
his
grandmother’s
house,
fled
because
he
was
unfear
of
his
life
and
we
made
of
that
put
proof
on
that.
the
fact
that
the
court
didn’t
permit
us
to
introduce
that
evidence
certainly
should
not
be
use
as
an
argument
for
provocation.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
grandmother
was
prepare
to
testify
the
he
came
running
up
to
the
house
and
the
offer
of
proof
was
nana.
they
have
just
killed
whatever
lanzi’s
first
name
was,
they
just
killed
joey
and
i
am
afraid
they
are
going
to
kill
me
and
i
am
going
to
hide.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
he
did
not
use
that
language
as
i
recall
it
mr.
justice.
he
did
say
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
that’s
right
but
not
as
evidence.
the
restatement
by
first
accuse
first-degree
murder
is
an
unsworn
statement.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
it
is
not
we
got
this
evidence.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
he
did
argued
that
and
i
might
point
out
that
the
evidence
against
dechristoforo
was
that
he
was
in
the
automobile
at
the
time
they
found
a
man
dead.
that
they
made
false
statements
to
officer
car
concerning
his
own
identity,
concerning
the
identity
of
the
man
in
the
front
seat
of
the
automobile
the
deceased
and
that
he
then
fled.
the
facts
were
that
officer
car
in
a
prior
hearing
on
a
probable
cost
against
oreto
on
the
roof
stated
that
was
oreto
who
would
given
the
false
name
of
the
man
in
there.
that
it
was
oreto
who
had
made
the
false
statements
which
at
this
trial
he
was
attributing
to
dechristoforo.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
by
any
means.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
none
at
all.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
motive.
the
fact
the
evidence
was
that
dechristoforo
and
lanzi
were
closed
personal
friends
and
that
was
brought
up
by
the
commonwealth
itself
because
i
say
i
am
sure
that
mr.
mills
didn’t
intent
to
mislead
the
court
by
with
respect
to
the
guns.
there
was
nothing
to
tied
dechristoforo
up
to
the
derringer
that
was
on
the
back
seat.
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
had
never
own
the
gun
in
fact
there
was
uncontradicted
evidence
from
a
police
officer
in
a
district,
from
friends
that
this
young
men
had
an
extra
reputation
not
only
for
honesty
but
for
non
violence
in
the
state
house
where
he’d
worked
as
page
for
7
or
8
years
just
prior
to
getting
this
other
job
and
the
community
where
he
lived.
the
only
evidence
that
was
involved
in
a
gun
was
the
argument
made
by
the
prosecutor.
when
he
said
and
there
was
no
foundation
for
this,
you
know
these
people.
these
are
the
kind
of
people
who
carried
guns
that
can
never
be
identified
and
never
be
traced.
i
don’t
believe
that
the
argument
picking
out
in
argument
that
was
improper
and
here
will
many
improper
arguments
in
and
on
themselves
would
warrant
this
court
to
sustain
the
court
of
appeals.
but
i
do
believe
that
there
was
a
false
argument
made
here.
we
knew
it
was
false
and
it
was
done
for
the
purpose
of
misleading
that
jury
and
the
jury
was
misled.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
case
involving
an
affirmative
falsity
of
a
prosecutor
statements
and
not
a
case
of
a
procedural
error
arising
from
a
technically
improper
argument
rectified
by
juror
of
instructions.
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
appendix
241,
we
have
before
as
a
case
with
a
prosecutor
despite
the
fact
that
was
wholly
and
true,
struggling
indicated
to
the
jury
that
the
defendant
had
offer
to
plea
guilty.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well
i
think
mr.
justice,
that
rational
of
the
court
my
argument
is
that
when
a
prosecutor
made
that
statement.
he
will
knew
at
that
time
that
the
respondent
have
not
sought
to
plead
guilty
to
any
offense.
he
also
well
knew
that
if
the
respondent
was
seeking
a
something
a
less
than
first-degree
murder.
you
could
have
had
it
for
the
asking
because
they
have
been
two
other
defendants,
oreto
and
gagliardi,
both
of
whom
have
pleaded
to
second-degree
murder
on
the
recommendation
of
the
same
prosecutor
and
had
been
given
life
sentences.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
i
would
not.
oh
no,
i
see.
it
mean
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
because
he
couldn’t
have
had
that
opinion
your
honor.
knowing
that
oreto
and
gagliardi
and
might
--
i
am
sure
mr.
mills
didn’t
contempt
to
mislead
the
court.
the
commonwealth
in
its
closing
argument
conceited
that
oreto
was
the
one
who
fired
one
shot
into
the
head
of
lanzi
the
deceased
and
that
gagliardi
have
fired
of
three
shots
into
his
side
and
consider
that
dechristoforo
had
never
fired
any
shots.
so
that
you
have
a
situation
where
the
two
triggerman;
gagliardi
and
oreto
where
allowed
to
plead
guilty
to
second-degree
murder
and
given
life
sentences.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
district
attorney
knew
that
and
as
they
saying
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
their
brief
and
i
think
the
petition
for
suit
at
page
25
in
their
brief
at
page
24
that
it
would
be
silly
to
argue
to
say
that
they
wouldn’t
have
given
dechristoforo
a
plea
to
second-degree
and
he
ask
for
it?
so
that
at
the
time
of
the
district
attorney
made
that
argument
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
he
knew
that
that
was
a
false
argument.
he
knew
that
we
would
looking
for
something
a
little
bit
less
because
we
could
of
got
a
little
bit
less
just
as
the
other
two.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
i
didn’t
know
of
read
anything
only
opinion
of
the
court
says
anything
about
plead
bargaining.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
or
there
was
a
stipulation.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
nothing
i
know
off.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
they
knew
that
gagliardi
to
plead
guilty.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
no.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
no,
no.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
that
he
is
seeking
something
less.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
i
think
the
conclusion
as
obvious
that
he
was
saying
to
the
jury
that
i
as
a
prosecutor
who
went
along
with
a
plea
of
guilty
for
gagliardi
at
the
evidence
than
in
before
that
jury.
that
gagliardi
had
shot
the
deceased
three
times
on
the
side.
that
i
as
a
prosecutor
having
agreed
and
recommended
to
the
court,
in
effect
that
the
court
accept
the
plea
of
guilty
to
second-degree
murder.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
i
beg
you,
pardon?
mr.
paul
t.
smith
that
so
your
honor.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
that
so.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
this
maybe
so
mr.
justice.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
i
beg
you,
pardon?
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
i
think
that
what
you
get
out
of
that
language
is
that
the
--
that
the
respondent
was
admitting
his
guilt.
if
he
was
seeking
sampling
a
little
less
than
first-degree
murder,
he
obviously
was
admitting
that
he
was
just
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
yes.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
but
mr.
justice,
that
wasn’t
the
case
here
by
way
of
the
very
stipulation.
the
respondents
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
yes.
but
stip
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
that
is
correct
mr.
justice.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
i
am
only
saying
that
the
stipulation
establishes
that
dechristoforo
had
never
sought
to
plead
guilty
to
any
offense
and
that
the
statement
by
the
prosecutor
knowing
that
he
had
never
sought
to
plead
guilty
to
any
offense.
and
knowing
also
that
dechristoforo
had
sought
to
plead
guilty,
he
could
of
have
it
for
asking
the
statement
by
the
prosecutor.
i
quite
frankly
think
that
they
hope
you
find
him
guilty
of
something
a
little
less
than
first-degree
murder
is
a
false
statement.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
that
is
correct
and
i
would
like
to
explain
what
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
i
--
yes
that
maybe
so
mr.
chief
justice
but
of
course
i
would
like
the
brief
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
i
think
that
mr.
mills
unwittingly
mislead
your
honor
in
answering
your
question
put
to
you,
put
to
him
by
you.
the
commonwealth
conceited
that
the
gun
that
was
found
on
the
seat
where
oreto
had
been
seated
had
been
fired
by
oreto
into
the
back
of
the
head
of
the
deceased
that
the
gun
that
was
laid
to
found
elsewhere
was
the
gun
that
had
been
used
by
gagliardi
to
fire
a
three
shots.
the
third
gun
that
was
found
in
there
was
a
derringer,
fully
loaded
had
not
been
used.
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
there
was
evidence
that
oreto
had
worn
black
gloves,
black
silk
gloves
kidskin
gloves.
the
evidence
appeared
to
be
assuming
that
there
was
no
evidence
on
the
contrary
that
dechristoforo
had
no
gloves.
there
were
no
fingerprints
on
the
derringer
which
was
found
and
which
was
fully
loaded
in
the
back
of
the
car.
now,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
prosecutor
could
have
had
an
honest
opinion
and
saying
oh,
i
do
not
know
what
they
want.
i
think
that
what
they
want
is
something
a
little
less
than
first-degree
murder.
i’d
submit
that
when
a
matter
is
within
the
personal
knowledge
of
the
speaker
that
qualifying
the
phrase
by
the
words
“i
think”
doesn’t
convert
a
falsehood
into
a
possible
truth
or
a
factual
statement
into
an
opinion.
now,
he
knew
the
prosecutor
was
speaking
of
a
factual
proposition.
he
knew
that
no
author,
no
attempt
had
been
made
to
plead
to
anything
in
the
case.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
but
he
is
--
mr.
justice,
he
is
testifying
from
his
knowledge,
that
jury
seating
there
has
a
right
to
believe
that
when
a
district
attorney
says
to
them
i
quite
frankly
believe
something
that
he
has
a
source
of
information
unknown
to
them,
not
in
the
record,
not
put
on
in
a
trial
of
the
case
that
as
a
district
attorney
he
knows
something.
and
when
he
says
“i
quite
frankly
believe”
and
knows
that
he
cannot
believe
that
but
he
says
this
to
a
jury,
i
think
that
a
jury
has
a
right
to
draw
the
conclusion
that
dechristoforo
made
some
overture
to
plead
guilty
to
something.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
under
the
massachusetts
law,
the
court
is
required
to
instruct
on
first-degree,
second-degree
and
manslaughter.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
i
think
you
want
further
than
that.
he
said
he
quite
frankly
believed
that
that’s
what
dechristoforo
want
to.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
because
it
isn’t
the
fact
and
he
knew
it
wasn’t
the
fact
and
stating
that
to
the
jury
obviously
is
a
statement
that
dechristoforo
has
indicated
that
he
is
guilty
of
something.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
this
was
a
case
of
joint
venture
charge.
all
during
the
whole
course
of
the
trial.
i
made
every
effort
to
get
the
commonwealth
to
conceive
that
if
that
gagliardi
had
fired
the
three
shots
that
oreto
had
fired
the
one
shot
and
that
dechristoforo
had
never
fired
any
shots.
they
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
yes,
surely,
if
he
had
been
engaged
in
a
joint
venture
here
and
i
argue
that
to
the
court
in
the
lobby
or
in
chambers
and
the
district
attorneys
said
that
he
would
not
agree
to
any
such
--
he
would
not
agree
to
that.
as
a
concuss,
we
had
to
try
this
case
on
the
theory
that
the
commonwealth
was
going
to
try
to
show
that
dechristoforo
had
fired
some
shots
here
and
it
wasn’t
until
after
my
closing
argument
when
the
prosecutor
made
his
closing
argument.
but
for
the
first
time,
he
conceited
and
he
said
to
the
jury
that
theory
of
commonwealth
cases
that
gagliardi
shot
three
times
in
the
side
and
that
oreto
shot
him
once
through
the
head.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
no,
your
honor.
we
have
no
right
to
rebut
and
that
position
is
that
when
the
prosecutor
made
this
statement,
he
was
on
affect
testifying.
we
had
no
right
to
cross
examine
him.
we
have
no
right
to
rebut
us
and
that
was
left
with
the
jury.
the
impression
was
clearly
left
that
dechristoforo
was
seeking
something
less
than
first-degree
murder
and
on
affect.
a
representation
that
jury,
that
he
the
prosecutor
had
reason
to
believe
that
because
he
quite
frankly
thought
that
pretty
so
and
as
a
consequence
that
dechristoforo
was
in
a
fact
confessing
to
the
crime
but
was
seeking
to
get
maybe
a
better
deal.
now,
i
submit
that
this
false
statement
and
it
is
false
and
it
wasn’t
simply
an
opinion,
it
was
on
an
unequivocal
statement
that
he
frankly
believed
a
better
that
he
couldn’t
possibly
frankly
believe
because
he
knew
right
along
that
there
was
that
we
will
go
into
trial
all
the
way
through
on
this
thing.
and
when
he
made
that
argument
which
the
petitioner
conceives
as
an
improper
argument,
i
say
it
reaches
the
constitutional
dimensions
and
that
we
would
deprive
to
do
processes
result.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
i
don’t
think
it
would
have
reached
the
dimensions
that
his
argument
made
into
that.
i
would
not
--
i
don’t
approve
of
that
type
of
an
argument
but
i
don’t
think
i
could
quarrel
with
that
to
the
extent
that
i
am
quarreling
of
this
argument.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
oh,
no.
no,
i
think
that’s
perfectly
proper
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do
think
that
had
he
said
that
the
evidence
or
the
argument
by
the
defense
counsel
is
such
as
to
lead
you
to
believe
that
this
is
all
your
case
of
manslaughter
which
of
course
it
couldn’t
be
in
assistance
because
it
was
a
joint
venture
and
this
was
a
first-degree
murder
case,
there
wasn’t
any
question
about
it.
it
was
a
joint
venture
and
if
he
was
guilty,
he
was
guilty
at
least
to
the
same
degree
as
the
others
who
actually
plead
to
guilty
to
the
second-degree
murder
and
i
do
not
see
how
they
could
have
been
on
manslaughter
unless
the
jury
get
where
he
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
it
is
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
yes,
it
does.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
frankly
i
wasn’t
thinking
of
those
terms
of
manslaughter
or
anything
else
and
certainly
by
the
very
fact
that
we
didn’t
make
any
attempt
to
negotiate
a
plea.
where
as
a
prosecutor
points
out
in
his
brief,
he
says
it
would
make
not
a
width
of
sense
to
refuse
to
give
dechristoforo
at
least
the
same
type
of
consideration
as
they
gave
to
the
triggerman
to
gagliardi
and
the
other
fellow.
to
get
back
to
you,
first
now
that
i
think
more
of,
but
that
i
think
mr.
chief
justice
that
is
so.
i
think
that
perhaps
in
a
trial
of
the
case,
an
advocate
does
have
in
mind
the
possibility
that
if
the
jury
is
going
to
come
in
with
the
guilty,
that
of
be
the
least
possible
degree
and
i
think
that
the
statement
as
you
put.
if
you
have
made
that
statement
of
the
jury,
i
don’t
think
that
be
any
quarrel.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
i
don’t
think
that
be
any
quarrel.
but
i
think
when
he
says
i
quite
frankly
believe
this.
i
quite
frankly
think
that
he
seeking
something
other
than
first-degree
murder.
i
think
that
a
jury
seating
there
has
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
knows
of
something
that
they
don’t
know
about
and
that
that
is
testimony
and
that
we
would
deprive
the
cause
of
the
right
of
confrontation
but
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
and
i
might
point
this
at
--
although
he
says
in
his
brief,
the
petitioners
saying
in
their
brief
that
it
doesn’t
make
or
would
of
sense
that
they
wouldn’t
have
offered
him
dechristoforo
something
lessen
first-degree
murder.
but
at
that
time
of
trials,
it
made
a
good
deal
of
sense
to
the
prosecutor
because
he
argued
to
the
jury
and
he
pointing
to
dechristoforo
more
than
anybody
else
i
think
he
is
more
reprehensible
than
the
other
two
combine
because
he
was
the
man
who
supposedly
he
was
the
friend
of
lanzi,
the
victim.
so
during
the
trial,
he
had
an
appeared
that
dechristoforo
was
the
real
bad
man
on
this
situation
that
the
two
triggermen
went
the
bad
fellows
and
so
that
the
posture
of
trial
was
that
he
wouldn’t
give
dechristoforo
a
plea
of
second-degree
except
a
plea
of
second-degree.
in
short,
he
and
any
compound
of
it
after
the
objection
was
made
to
the
argument
by
saying
to
the
jury
i
believe
that
there
is
no
doubt
on
this
case,
none
whatsoever.
now,
all
i
am
arguing
to
this
court
is
that
the
statement
made
by
the
prosecutor
goes
beyond
a
technical
error
in
arguing.
it
was
a
false
statement.
it
is
tons
amount
to
the
introduction
of
false
evidence
and
that
at
this
court
should
regard
it
in
the
same
fashion
that
has
regarded
of
the
alcorda
case,
napue,
miller
and
pate
giglio.
a
false
statement
made
by
the
prosecutor
which
had
at
least
created
an
impression
in
the
minds
of
the
jury
that
the
defendant
here
had
offer
to
plead
guilty
and
of
not.
i
just
like
that
false
by
saying
that
it
was
some
reference
to
provocation.
i
would
submit
that
that
is
a
suspicious
argument.
there
was
no
provocation.
we
have
seth
forth
in
our
brief
the
opening
and
the
fact
is
that
in
the
opening
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
a
lot
of
us
make
openings
which
we
can’t
this
is
severely
establish
but
virtually
every
manner
stated
in
the
opening
was
either
reproduce
an
evidence
or
there
was
a
proper
proof.
for
example,
i
offer
to
prove
that
dechristoforo
when
he
fled
and
fled
to
his
grandmother’s
house,
fled
because
he
was
unfear
of
his
life
and
we
made
of
that
put
proof
on
that.
the
fact
that
the
court
didn’t
permit
us
to
introduce
that
evidence
certainly
should
not
be
use
as
an
argument
for
provocation.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
grandmother
was
prepare
to
testify
the
he
came
running
up
to
the
house
and
the
offer
of
proof
was
nana.
they
have
just
killed
whatever
lanzi’s
first
name
was,
they
just
killed
joey
and
i
am
afraid
they
are
going
to
kill
me
and
i
am
going
to
hide.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
he
did
not
use
that
language
as
i
recall
it
mr.
justice.
he
did
say
--
mr.
paul
t.
smith
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
that’s
right
but
not
as
evidence.
the
restatement
by
first
accuse
first-degree
murder
is
an
unsworn
statement.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
it
is
not
we
got
this
evidence.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
well,
he
did
argued
that
and
i
might
point
out
that
the
evidence
against
dechristoforo
was
that
he
was
in
the
automobile
at
the
time
they
found
a
man
dead.
that
they
made
false
statements
to
officer
car
concerning
his
own
identity,
concerning
the
identity
of
the
man
in
the
front
seat
of
the
automobile
the
deceased
and
that
he
then
fled.
the
facts
were
that
officer
car
in
a
prior
hearing
on
a
probable
cost
against
oreto
on
the
roof
stated
that
was
oreto
who
would
given
the
false
name
of
the
man
in
there.
that
it
was
oreto
who
had
made
the
false
statements
which
at
this
trial
he
was
attributing
to
dechristoforo.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
evidence
was
overwhelming
by
any
means.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
none
at
all.
mr.
paul
t.
smith
motive.
the
fact
the
evidence
was
that
dechristoforo
and
lanzi
were
closed
personal
friends
and
that
was
brought
up
by
the
commonwealth
itself
because
i
say
i
am
sure
that
mr.
mills
didn’t
intent
to
mislead
the
court
by
with
respect
to
the
guns.
there
was
nothing
to
tied
dechristoforo
up
to
the
derringer
that
was
on
the
back
seat.
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
had
never
own
the
gun
in
fact
there
was
uncontradicted
evidence
from
a
police
officer
in
a
district,
from
friends
that
this
young
men
had
an
extra
reputation
not
only
for
honesty
but
for
non
violence
in
the
state
house
where
he’d
worked
as
page
for
7
or
8
years
just
prior
to
getting
this
other
job
and
the
community
where
he
lived.
the
only
evidence
that
was
involved
in
a
gun
was
the
argument
made
by
the
prosecutor.
when
he
said
and
there
was
no
foundation
for
this,
you
know
these
people.
these
are
the
kind
of
people
who
carried
guns
that
can
never
be
identified
and
never
be
traced.
i
don’t
believe
that
the
argument
picking
out
in
argument
that
was
improper
and
here
will
many
improper
arguments
in
and
on
themselves
would
warrant
this
court
to
sustain
the
court
of
appeals.
but
i
do
believe
that
there
was
a
false
argument
made
here.
we
knew
it
was
false
and
it
was
done
for
the
purpose
of
misleading
that
jury
and
the
jury
was
misled.
