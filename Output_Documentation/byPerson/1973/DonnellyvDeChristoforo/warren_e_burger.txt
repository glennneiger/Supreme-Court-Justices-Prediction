before
you
leave
this
factual
situation,
you’ve
already
pointed
out
that
the
record
shows
that
there
where
three
pistols
involved
here.
two
in
the
garn,
one
had
been
removed
from
the
car
and
they
are
three
alive
passengers
in
the
car.
was
there
anything
in
the
record?
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
identifies
any
of
those
firearms
with
the
specific
defendants
of
these
three
passengers
by
way
of
gun
registration
or
sort
of
thing?
chief

did
the
defense
counsel
in
his
opening
statement
to
the
jury
outline
some
evidence
that
he
intended
to
prove
which
he
later
did
not
support
with
evidence?
it
is
the
position
of
the
petitioner
your
honor
that
several
items
in
the
opening
and
in
the
closing
made
by
the
defense
counsel
where
never
proven
at

chief

e.

you
mr.

mr.
smith?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
let
me
pursue
that
with
you
a
little.
you
said
that
twice
now
it
is
a
false
statement
it
is
express
as
an
opinion
of
course
is
it
not?
you
say
there
is
no
basis
whatever
for
an
opinion
playing
aside
that
the
friday
if
the
remark,
now
i
am
just
going
to
your
claim
that
the
prosecutor
knew
this
was
false.
you
said
there
is
no
basis
in
this
record
for
an
opinion
that
this
man
might
be
simply
hoping
for
a
lesser
include
the
defense?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
pursue
at
the
moment,
the
three
pistols
in
the
car
and
three
men
and
a
dead
man.
don't
you
think
a
jury
or
juror
could
reasonably
infer
from
that?
that
each
of
these
men
and
had
a
gun
and
that
each
of
them
was
prepared
to
do
whatever
that
was
necessary
to
disposed
of
this
fellow?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
tell
us,
it
would
be
a
reasonable
inference,
wouldnt
it?
it
would
be
a
reasonable
inferencethat
a
juror
could
draw
from
the
physical
evidence
in
this
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
smith,
let
me
ask
you
what
is
obviously
hypothetical
question
to
prove
that
the
impact
to
this
kind
of
statement
on
the
jury.
suppose
and
instead
of
putting
it
the
way
he
did
he
had
said
after
his
first
sentence.
i
do
not
what
they
want
you
to
do
by
way
of
a
verdict,
but
then
went
on,
but
i
suggest
to
you
when
you
get
in
the
jury
room,
you
ask
yourselves
whether
what
they
really
want
is
that
you
find
him
guilty
of
something
a
little
less
than
first-degree
murder.
would
you
thought
that
was
all
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
suggesting
that
it
would
be
an
impropriety
to
pose
the
kind
of
questions
the
jurors
should
consider?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn’t
it
quite
common
for
the
jury
to
find
the
triggerman
as
he
would
be
called
guilty
of
a
higher
degree
of
homicide
than
the
driver
of
the
car
for
example?
not
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
perfectly
a
common
everyday
and
every
state
in
the
union?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,so
that
you
have
a
reasonable
case
for
lesser
offense
in
first-degree
murder
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
mean
as
to
the
question
they
should
ask
themselves?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
a
life
or
some
i
presume
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
will
you
going
to
prove
that
mr.
smith?
by
which
kind
of
evidence?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
prosecutor
argue
that
if
dechristoforo
really
had
been
innocent.
if
his
claim
was
bonafide
in
this
respect
that
he
was
merely
a
passenger
that
he
would’ve
welcome
the
presence
of
the
officers
and
immediately
told
the
officers
the
whole
story
of
what
had
happened?
