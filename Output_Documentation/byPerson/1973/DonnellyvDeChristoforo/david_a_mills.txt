these
case
in
on

for
the
district
of
massachusetts
which
had
denied
without
prejudice
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
presented
by
the
respondent
pursuant
to
title
28
section
2254.
the
basis
of
the
state
custody
of
the
petitioner
in
that
proceeding
had
been
affected
by
conviction
in
the
state

court
of

in
the
first

and

the

may
of
1967
for
murder
in
the
first-degree
and
firearms
possessions
charges.
he
was
apprehended
approximately
20
months
later
and
was
brought
to
trial
with
a
co-defendant
when
gagliardi
in
april
of
1969.
the
petitioner
wishes
to
stress
the
components
of
that
trial.
the
trial
was
a
seven-day
trial.
it
was
preceded
with
pre
trial
discovery
including
a
pre
trial
discovery
motions
seven
of
which
were
allowed.
one
of
the
pre
trial
discovery
motions
was
a
motion
for
bill
of
particulus
which
according
to
massachusetts
practice
was
read
to
the
jury.
additionally,
the
trial
included
opening
instructions
by
the
judge
to
the
jury
opening
remarks
by
council.
the
testimony
of
two
primary
police
witnesses,
two
secondary
police
witnesses,
a
chemist,
a
ballisticians,
a
pathologist,
two
fbi
agents
and
several
civilian
witnesses.
additionally
at
the
cost
of
the
trial,
several
exhibits
were
introduced
including
weapons
and
documents.
additional
components
of
the
trial
included
closing
remarks
by
the
assistant
district
attorney,
defense
council,
closing
instruction
by
the
jury
and
an
sworn
statement
by
the
respondent
as
a
defendant,
a
practice
which
was
in
effect
in
1969
in
massachusetts.
it
should
also
be
noted
that
the
trial
was
preceded
by
a
view.
those
are
the
components
of
the
trial.
the
fannies
of
which
is
in
question
before
this
court
today.
the
uncontradicted
evidence
before
the
court
tended
to
show
that
the
respondent
along
with
three
other
persons
was
seen
in
a
car
at
approximately
4
o’clock
in
morning
on
april
18,
1967.
he
was
seen
there
by
two
police
officers
each
of
whom
testified
at
the
trial.
the
uncontradicted
evidence
further
tends
to
show
that
when
gagliardi,
the
co-defendant
was
the
driver
of
the
car
that
the
respondent
in
the
case
before
this
court,
then
defendant
dechristoforo
was
a
passenger
in
the
rear
seat
of
the
car
seated
behind
gagliardi
that
a
third
alive
passenger,
oreto,
was
also
seated
in
the
back
seat,
and
then
a
fourth
person
when
lanzi,
who
appeared
to
be
asleep,
was
in
the
front
passenger
seat
of
the
cab.
the
evidence
further
tends
to
show
that
dechristoforo
and
gagliardi
were
questioned
by
the
police
at
the
seen
prior
to
the
determination
by
the
police
that
lanzi
was
not
in
fact
asleep
but
was
dead,
having
been
shot
once
in
the
head
and
three
times
in
the
side.
apparently
and
according
to
the
uncontradicted
testimony,
dechristoforo
and
gagliardi
were
questioned
at
the
scene.
evidence
which
is
contested
in
path
was
introduced
at
the
trial
to
show
that
after
seen
respondent
dechristoforo
when
questioned
as
to
his
own
identity
and
purpose
gave
the
police
a
wrong
name,
a
wrong
description
of
the
reason
why
they
would
there
in
that
place
and
identify
the
deceased
victim
by
a
name
other
than
his
own.
in
effect,
the
respondent
said
did
not
say
that
his
name
was
dechristoforo,
said
that
the
disease
person
had
been
injured
in
a
fight
and
revere
and
was
been
taken
to
the
hospital
and
gave
a
wrong
description,
a
wrong
name
with
respect
to
the
decedent.
gagliardi
and
the
respondent
dechristoforo
then
left
the
scene.
it
was
then
determined
that
lanzi
was
dead.
the
third
occupant,
the
third
live
occupant
of
the
cab
was
arrested
at
that
time.
during
the
course
of
the
trial
additionally,
there
was
evidence
that
death
had
been
cost
by
gunshot
wounds
that
occurred
in
the
cab
between
3
and
4
o’clock
in
the
morning.
additionally
at
the
scene,
the
police
found
a
38
revolver
in
the
back
seat
where
oreto
had
been
seated
that
had
been
shot
once.
an
additional
weapon
a
derringer
fully
loaded
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
seat
were
respondent
dechristoforo
had
been
seated
and
it
was
also
evidence
at
the
trial
that
a
third
revolver
was
laid
to
found
buried
in
an
area
adjacent
to
the
location
of
the
cab
and
evidence
by
way
of
ballistics
was
introduced
to
show
that
the
wound
in
the
head
in
the
decedent
had
been
caused
by
the
gun
that
was
found
on
the
back
seat
and
that
the
three
shots
in
the
side
of
the
decedent
had
been
caused
by
that
revolver
that
was
laid
to
found
buried
behind
the
scene.
now,
at
the
close
of
all
of
the
evidence
co-defendant
gagliardi
pleaded
guilty
in
the
absence
of
the
jury.
when
the
jury
was
brought
into
the
court
room,
the
trial
judge
instructed
or
remark
to
the
juries
and
i
quote
in
the
quote
is
contain
on
page
7
of
the
petitioners
brief.
"mr.
foreman
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
you
have
noted
that
the
defendant
gagliardi
is
not
in
the
dock,
he
has
pleaded
guilty
and
his
case
has
been
disposed
off."
we
will,
therefore
go
forward
with
the
trial
of
the
case
of
commonwealth
v.
dechristoforo
that
is
detained
also
in
the
appendix
record
of
page
99.
at
that
time
consistent
with
what
the
petitioners
suggests
with
the
admirable
trial
tactics
of
defense
council,
no
objection
was
made
to
that
remark,
no
instruction
was
ask
and
no
instruction
was
given.
thereafter,
respondents’
council
proceeded
with
his
closing
arguments
to
the
jury.
the
prosecutors’
argument
as
is
the
custom
in
massachusetts
followed
the
defense
council’s
closing
argument.
and
at
the
beginning,
i
hesitate
to
read
to
the
court
and
yet,
i
am
reluctant
to
read
a
single
remark
to
this
court
without
reading
some
of
the
context
in
which
that
single
remark
occurred.
mr.
david
a.
mills
from
petitioner’s
brief
your
honor
at
page
9.
the
prosecutor’s
closing
remarks
and
its
entirety
appears
in
the
record
appendix.
the
prosecutor’s
closing
argument
let
me
prefess
my
argument
by
saying
that
first
of
all,
i
am
aware
that
when
i
say
is
really
an
argument
because
the
word
argument
pre
supposes
that
i
am
prejudice
to
the
cause
that
i
represent
which
of
course
i
am.
i
think
that
the
very
nature
of
the
system
being
advisory
pitting
one
side
against
the
other
naturally
make
you
point
to
those
things
which
you
think
support
your
particular
position
and
to
more
or
less
ignore
those
things
which
i
supposed
detracked
from
it.
i
would
like
to
skip
down
one
paragraph
and
i
will
seize
reading.
and
i
realize
that
my
closing
argument
should
be
in
no
way
conceited
by
you
as
any
evidence
in
the
case
and
i
am
sure
that
you
won’t
consider
it
as
that
and
i
am
sure
that
my
opening
statement
to
you
is
in
no
way
evidence
in
the
case
and
it
won’t
be
conceited
by
you
as
evidence.
the
prosecutor
in
his
argument,
the
assistant
district
attorney
then
went
on
to
explain
to
the
jury
his
version
of
the
case
but
suffice
it
to
say
that
he
argued
to
the
jury.
his
argument
is
included
in
full
in
the
record
appendix.
during
that
argument
and
the
assistant
district
attorney
made
a
statement
which
is
contained
in
all
of
the
paper
in
this
case
and
in
petitioners
brief
at
page
11,
i
do
not
know
what
they
want
you
to
do
by
way
of
a
verdict.
they
said
that
they
hope
you
find
him
not
guilty.
i
quite
frankly
think
that
they
hope
that
you
find
him
guilty
of
something
a
little
less
than
first-degree
murder.
an
objection
to
this
remark
was
immediately
made
and
although
the
record
is
not
completely
clear
on
the
point
and
i
respectfully
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
the
record
appendix
at
page
129.
at
that
point,
mr.
smith
said
i
object
to
that.
the
court
said
i
do
not
think
mr.
smith
that
is
not
fair
argument.
the
court
know
mr.
smith
that
isn’t
so.
i
think
to
see
and
he
say
that
the
assistant
district
attorney
then
proceeded
with
his
argument
talking
about
another
topic.
the
record
shows
that
the
trial
judge
indicated
that
had
an
objection
that
the
objection
had
in
fact
been
sustained
and
that
had
counsel
requested
instruction
at
that
time,
they
would
have
been
given.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
he
is
an
assistant
attorney
general
in
massachusetts
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
it
is,
yes
your
honor.
now
following
--
may
i
please
the
court,
following
that
closing
argument
of
the
assistant
district
attorney,
the
defendant,
now
respondent
in
this
court,
was
allowed
to
make
an
unsworn
statement
to
the
jury.
thereafter
follow
the
instructions
of
the
court.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor
it
does.
although,
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
any
such
thing
anymore
in
massachusetts
called
an
unsworn
statement.
mr.
david
a.
mills
in
1969,
yes
your
honor.
the
judge
in
his
charge
first
i
think
it’s
only
fair
to
say
something
about
instructions
that
were
requested
by
the
defendants
now
respondents
counsel
specific
instructions
to
the
jury
by
way
of
a
writing
were
made
to
the
court,
they
are
also
contained
in
the
record's
appendix.
the
court
did
not
give
the
specific
instructions
that
were
requested
by
defendant’s
counsel.
the
court
charge
the
jury
and
the
portion
of
the
charge
which
we
wish
this
court
to
consider
is
contained
on
page
142
of
the
record
appendix,
given
the
fact
that
the
defendant’s
unsworn
statement
had
been
the
most
immediate
proceeding
event
in
the
trial
following
the
charge,
the
trial
judge
and
we
suggest
properly
first
commented
upon
the
unsworn
statement,
basically
saying
that
we
suggest
that
it
is
not
evidence.
and
at
page
143,
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
begging
the
court’s
indulgence
for
permission
to
read
his
instruction.
let
me
begin
this
charge
by
saying
to
you
that
as
i
have
said
with
regard
to
unsworn
statements
not
subject
to
cross-examination
of
the
defendant,
it
is
not
evidence,
nor
are
arguments
of
counsel
nor
the
opening
of
counsel
whether
it
be
the
assistant
district
attorney
in
this
case
or
whether
it
be
mr.
smith.
it
is
not
evidence
for
your
consideration.
opening
of
counsel
made
by
either
the
district
attorney
or
mr.
smith
on
behalf
of
his
client
are
not
evidence,
but
they
are
merely
for
statement
by
the
district
attorney
or
by
mr.
smith
the
defense
counsel
for
which
they
respectively
hope
to
prove.
drop
down
two
lines
to
the
next
full
paragraph,
excuse
me
your
honors.
the
closing
arguments
tool
madame
and
gentleman
of
the
jury,
the
counsel
often
becomes
over
zealous.
closing
arguments
are
not
evidence
for
your
consideration.
closing
arguments
madame
and
gentleman
are
merely
statements
by
the
respective
counsel
as
to
how
they
hope
you
will
view
the
evidence
of
which
you
have
heard
and
now
with
particular
reference
to
that
paragraph
of
instructions
beginning
at
page
at
the
bottom
of
page
143
of
the
record
appendix.
the
judge
continued.
now
in
his
closing
with
district
attorney,
i
noted
made
a
statement.
i
don’t
know
what
they
want
you
to
do
by
way
of
a
verdict.
they
said
they’ve
hope
that
you
find
him
not
guilty.
i
quiet
frankly
think
that
they
hope
you
find
him
guilty
of
something
a
little
less
than
first-degree
murder.
there
is
no
evidence
of
that
whatsoever.
of
course,
you
are
instructed
to
disregard
that
statement
made
by
the
district
attorney
consider
the
case
as
there
is
no
such
statement
was
made.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
murder
in
the
first-degree
with
a
recommendation
of
the
death
penalty
not
to
be
imposed
and
verdicts
of
guilty
on
each
of
two
counts
of
a
firearms
charge.
the
case
prior
to
appeal
in
the
state
courts
are
the
defendant
move
for
a
new
trial
in
the
state
courts
and
the
case
was
then
appeal
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
the
commonwealth
on
several
assignments
of
error
including
an
assignment
of
the
denial
of
the
defendant’s
motion
for
mistrial.
in
other
words,
the
question
of
the
propriety
and
the
alleged
prejudice
of
the
remarks
made
by
assistant
district
attorney
in
his
closing
will
brought
to
the
full
court
in
massachusetts.
mr.
david
a.
mills
your
honor,
interestingly
enough,
the
only
identification
about
weapon
as
to
any
particular
defendant
had
to
do
with
the
position
of
the
weapon
in
the
car
and
the
fact
that
one
weapon
was
found
in
an
area
with
the
driver
gagliardi
had
left
for
after
being
questioned
by
the
police
and
the
record
explicitly
shows
that
all
identification
had
been
previously
removed
from
the
firearms.
the
case
was
seasonal
re-appealed
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
on
this
question
and
the
court
by
a
solid
majority
and
over
a
various
strenuous
and
explicit
dissent
by
our
chief
justice
which
was
concurred
by
another
justice
concluded
that
the.
and
i
should
know
excuse
me
your
honors
that
our
court,
the
supreme
judicial
court,
anonymously
noted
the
impropriety
of
this
remarks
and
soundly
condemn
them.
finding
however
that
the
argument
as
a
whole
did
not
require
a
mistrial
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
the
criteria
that
the
court
used
in
coming
to
its
conclusion
and
they
are
of
course,
contained
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
which
is
reprinted
inform
the
record
appendix.
mr.
david
a.
mills
unique
in
what,
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
david
a.
mills
unique
in
the
sense
that
if
it’s
also
contained
in
your
closing
statement
your
honor,
we
suggest
that
it
perhaps
is
unique.
the
supreme
judicial
court
explicitly
examined
the
whole
argument
and
the
whole
trial
proceeding
consistent
with
an
obligation
on
the
massachusetts
law
that
in
capital
cases,
the
entire
trial
proceeding
be
examined.
the
supreme
judicial
court
examined
the
judge’s
instructions,
the
lack
of
an
immediate
request
for
instructions
after
some
of
the
remarks
were
made.
mr.
david
a.
mills
i
suggest
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
your
honor
that
respondent’s
count,
excuse
me,
defendants
counsel
could
not
have
continued
his
objection
in
requested
a
bench
conference
at
that
junction
in
the
instruction
as
he
had
at
various
portion
in
the
trial,
and
it
should
be
noted
that
as
additional
components
of
this
trial
objection
numbering
approximately
200
were
made
and
105
explicit
exceptions
noted
on
the
record
of
this
trial.
so,
it
was
not
a
trial
with
inactivity
of
the
fact
of
defendant’s
counsel.
mr.
david
a.
mills
i
can
only
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
your
honor,
but
i
can
only
suggest
that
there
are
lobby
conferences
and
bench
conferences.
lobby
conferences
would
be
in
the
judge’s
office
perhaps
for
setting
ground
rules
and
schedules
of
trial.
a
bench
conference
is
during
the
course
of
live
testimony
in
the
court
room.
the
supreme
judicial
court,
our
supreme
judicial
court
also
noted
the
weight
of
the
evidence
that
had
been
introduced
against
the
accused
and
the
improbability
that
a
jury
in
massachusetts
withdraw
the
settle
inferences
that
have
been
suggested
by
the
defendant
in
the
state
court,
in
the
federal
district
court
that
have
been
adopted
by
the
circuit
court
and
that
i
suggested
before
this
court
today.
i
have
noted
the
dissent,
i
am
sure
of
our
chief
justice
to
the
majority
opinion
in
massachusetts.
a
petition
to
habeas
corpus
was
filed
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts,
the
petition,
the
return;
the
memorandum
of
united
states
magistrate
davis
and
the
transcript
of
the
arguments
before
the
district
judge
on
this
petition
are
contained
in
whole
in
the
appendix.
the
petition
was
denied
without
prejudice.
the
district
judge
concluding
with
respect
to
the
claim
of
prejudice
based
upon
the
assistant
district
attorney’s
remarks.
the
prosecutor’s
arguments
were
not
so
prejudicial
as
to
deprive
the
petitioner
of
his
constitutional
right
to
a
fair
trial.
on
appeal
to
the
circuit
court,
the
court
concerned
itself
and
concerned
itself
explicitly
solely
with
what
the
petitioner
claim
had
been
improper
argument
by
the
prosecuting
attorney.
and
determine
that
the
particular
remark,
i
do
not
know
what
they
want
you
to
do
by
way
of
a
verdict,
when
read
in
the
light
of
the
proceeding
instruction
of
the
jury
at
the
time
of
the
plea
of
co-defendant
gagliardi
in
effect
amounted
to
a
representation
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
to
the
jury
that
their
defendant
dechristoforo
had
offered
to
plead
guilty
and
that
his
plea
had
been
rejected.
the
parties
stipulated
before
the
circuit
court
after
argument
in
this
case
that
no
offered
to
plea
had
been
solicited.
that
no
offered
of
plea
had
been
made
and
that
the
defendant
insisted
upon
a
trial
at
all
times,
and
this
is
contained
within
the
text
of
the
circuit
court’s
opinion.
the
circuit
court
vacated
the
order
often
district
court.
the
primary
points
that
the
petitioner
suggest
to
this
court
this
morning
is
it
the
court
of
appeals
failed
to
fairly
consider
the
entire
trial
of
the
respondent
in
concluding
that
this
remark
when
read
in
the
light
of
an
early
instruction
deprive
to
him
with
a
fair
trial.
in
this
regard,
we
refer
again
to
the
105
exceptions,
to
the
12
or
14
witnesses,
to
the
7
days
of
trial,
to
the
view,
to
the
bill
of
particulus,
to
the
pre
trial
discovery,
to
all
of
the
items
that
have
been
mentioned
including
the
items
that
had
been
mentioned
in
this
court’s
december
decision
of
cupp
v.
naughten
which
is
the
court
recalls
involve
the
question
of
a
particular
instruction
by
a
trial
judge
and
a
standard
of
review.
we
suggest
that
the
standard
of
review
which
has
been
applicable
in
lower
federal
courts
including
our
first
circuit
in
the
patriotic
case
which
is
cited
in
the
brief
makes
it
incumbent
upon
the
circuit
court
and
the
district
court.
if
it
is
to
examine
an
allegation
of
impropriety
by
a
state
prosecutor
to
examine
all
of
the
trial
and
not
to
look
at
one
particular
remark
in
a
vacuum.
we
suggest
that
it
may
not
have
been
an
absolute
vacuum,
but
when
compared
to
the
standard
of
review
employed
by
our
own
supreme
judicial
court
when
it
examine
this
cas.
we
suggest
that
the
examination
tended
by
the
circuit
court
was
a
virtual
vacuum
because
although
it
examined
one
additional
earlier
instruction.
we
do
not
feel
that
that
court
adequately
examined
the
entire
trial
and
that
this
is
a
basis
of
error.
additionally,
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor.
the
entire
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
well
explicitly,
the
court
did
not
say
that
they
looked
at
that
your
honor
and
stated
--
i
suppose
the
petitioner
would
have
felt
better
if
the
court
said
it
had
examined
all
of
the
trial
your
honor
including
all
of
the
components
of
the
trial.
and
the
court
did
explicitly
say
at
the
outset
that
we
are
concerned
solely
with
what
petitioner
contends
were
improper
proposing
argument.
the
circuit
court,
the
petitioners
suggest
was
also
an
error
on
the
basis
of
certain
premises
that
it
used
in
reaching
its
conclusion
that
this
remark
was
effectively
a
representation
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
to
the
jury
that
the
defendant
had
offered
to
plea
and
his
plea
had
been
rejected.
first
of
the
circuit
court
without
any
foundation
in
the
record
suggested
that
the
co-defendant’s
plea
was
a
plea
to
second
degree
murder.
the
court
further
suggested
that
a
jury
must
always
want
it
to
some
extent
why
a
defendant
has
not
pleaded.
we
suggest
there
is
no
basis
for
this
in
a
record
and
that
it
isn’t
unfair
conclusion
to
draw
with
respect
to
a
jury
that
a
defendant.
excuse
me,
that
a
jury
knows
that
that
the
defendant
who
has
not
sought
to
plead,
even
did
not
wish
to
plead
or
he
was
deterred
by
the
belief
that
the
prosecutor
would
be
unreceptive.
a
sophistication
and
attributing
to
the
jury
knowledge
and
belief
that
we
do
not
feel
is
supported
by
the
record
and
it’s
not
fairly
attributed
to
a
massachusetts
jury.
the
circuit
court
also
suggested
that
the
jury
doesn’t
know
whether
or
not
a
defendants
offer
a
plea
has
been
made
and
refuse,
but
the
jury
knows
that
the
prosecutor
knows
and
we
suggest
that
this
is
violative
factually
of
the
stipulation
that
was
entered
into
by
the
parties
before
that
court.
we
suggested
that
the
first
circuit
has
concluded
that
jury
bargain,
excuse
me,
plea
bargaining
takes
place
in
all
criminal
trials
in
massachusetts
and
we
suggest
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
that
and
nothing
in
this
particular
case.
indeed,
the
parties
stipulated
that
no
offer
of
plea
had
been
accepted
and,
excuse
me,
no
offer
to
plead
had
been
made
and
no
offer
how
they
plea
had
been
solicited.
and
finally
with
respect
to
the
argument
by
the
respondent
that
what
was
substantially
done
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
was
a
misrepresentation
of
fact
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
did
not
believe
what
he
said.
when
he
made
an
improper
statement
of
opinion
to
the
jury
that
he
did
not
believe
what
he
said.
we
suggest
that
if
the
circuit
court
were
to
engage
in
speculation.
it
would
have
been
more
reasonable
to
speculate
that
is
a
matter
of
massachusetts
law
based
upon
the
elements
of
manslaughter
as
contained
in
massachusetts
cases.
the
improper
suggestion
of
opinion
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
was
referring
to
manslaughter
and
in
fact
was
an
opinion.
mr.
david
a.
mills
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
case
in
on
certiorari
to
the
first
circuit
court
of
appeals
to
review
a
judgment
of
that
court
vacating
an
order
of
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts
which
had
denied
without
prejudice
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
presented
by
the
respondent
pursuant
to
title
28
section
2254.
the
basis
of
the
state
custody
of
the
petitioner
in
that
proceeding
had
been
affected
by
conviction
in
the
state
trial
court
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
and
possession
of
firearms
violation.
the
respondent
was
indited
in
may
of
1967
for
murder
in
the
first-degree
and
firearms
possessions
charges.
he
was
apprehended
approximately
20
months
later
and
was
brought
to
trial
with
a
co-defendant
when
gagliardi
in
april
of
1969.
the
petitioner
wishes
to
stress
the
components
of
that
trial.
the
trial
was
a
seven-day
trial.
it
was
preceded
with
pre
trial
discovery
including
a
pre
trial
discovery
motions
seven
of
which
were
allowed.
one
of
the
pre
trial
discovery
motions
was
a
motion
for
bill
of
particulus
which
according
to
massachusetts
practice
was
read
to
the
jury.
additionally,
the
trial
included
opening
instructions
by
the
judge
to
the
jury
opening
remarks
by
council.
the
testimony
of
two
primary
police
witnesses,
two
secondary
police
witnesses,
a
chemist,
a
ballisticians,
a
pathologist,
two
fbi
agents
and
several
civilian
witnesses.
additionally
at
the
cost
of
the
trial,
several
exhibits
were
introduced
including
weapons
and
documents.
additional
components
of
the
trial
included
closing
remarks
by
the
assistant
district
attorney,
defense
council,
closing
instruction
by
the
jury
and
an
sworn
statement
by
the
respondent
as
a
defendant,
a
practice
which
was
in
effect
in
1969
in
massachusetts.
it
should
also
be
noted
that
the
trial
was
preceded
by
a
view.
those
are
the
components
of
the
trial.
the
fannies
of
which
is
in
question
before
this
court
today.
the
uncontradicted
evidence
before
the
court
tended
to
show
that
the
respondent
along
with
three
other
persons
was
seen
in
a
car
at
approximately
4
o’clock
in
morning
on
april
18,
1967.
he
was
seen
there
by
two
police
officers
each
of
whom
testified
at
the
trial.
the
uncontradicted
evidence
further
tends
to
show
that
when
gagliardi,
the
co-defendant
was
the
driver
of
the
car
that
the
respondent
in
the
case
before
this
court,
then
defendant
dechristoforo
was
a
passenger
in
the
rear
seat
of
the
car
seated
behind
gagliardi
that
a
third
alive
passenger,
oreto,
was
also
seated
in
the
back
seat,
and
then
a
fourth
person
when
lanzi,
who
appeared
to
be
asleep,
was
in
the
front
passenger
seat
of
the
cab.
the
evidence
further
tends
to
show
that
dechristoforo
and
gagliardi
were
questioned
by
the
police
at
the
seen
prior
to
the
determination
by
the
police
that
lanzi
was
not
in
fact
asleep
but
was
dead,
having
been
shot
once
in
the
head
and
three
times
in
the
side.
apparently
and
according
to
the
uncontradicted
testimony,
dechristoforo
and
gagliardi
were
questioned
at
the
scene.
evidence
which
is
contested
in
path
was
introduced
at
the
trial
to
show
that
after
seen
respondent
dechristoforo
when
questioned
as
to
his
own
identity
and
purpose
gave
the
police
a
wrong
name,
a
wrong
description
of
the
reason
why
they
would
there
in
that
place
and
identify
the
deceased
victim
by
a
name
other
than
his
own.
in
effect,
the
respondent
said
did
not
say
that
his
name
was
dechristoforo,
said
that
the
disease
person
had
been
injured
in
a
fight
and
revere
and
was
been
taken
to
the
hospital
and
gave
a
wrong
description,
a
wrong
name
with
respect
to
the
decedent.
gagliardi
and
the
respondent
dechristoforo
then
left
the
scene.
it
was
then
determined
that
lanzi
was
dead.
the
third
occupant,
the
third
live
occupant
of
the
cab
was
arrested
at
that
time.
during
the
course
of
the
trial
additionally,
there
was
evidence
that
death
had
been
cost
by
gunshot
wounds
that
occurred
in
the
cab
between
3
and
4
o’clock
in
the
morning.
additionally
at
the
scene,
the
police
found
a
38
revolver
in
the
back
seat
where
oreto
had
been
seated
that
had
been
shot
once.
an
additional
weapon
a
derringer
fully
loaded
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
seat
were
respondent
dechristoforo
had
been
seated
and
it
was
also
evidence
at
the
trial
that
a
third
revolver
was
laid
to
found
buried
in
an
area
adjacent
to
the
location
of
the
cab
and
evidence
by
way
of
ballistics
was
introduced
to
show
that
the
wound
in
the
head
in
the
decedent
had
been
caused
by
the
gun
that
was
found
on
the
back
seat
and
that
the
three
shots
in
the
side
of
the
decedent
had
been
caused
by
that
revolver
that
was
laid
to
found
buried
behind
the
scene.
now,
at
the
close
of
all
of
the
evidence
co-defendant
gagliardi
pleaded
guilty
in
the
absence
of
the
jury.
when
the
jury
was
brought
into
the
court
room,
the
trial
judge
instructed
or
remark
to
the
juries
and
i
quote
in
the
quote
is
contain
on
page
7
of
the
petitioners
brief.
"mr.
foreman
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
you
have
noted
that
the
defendant
gagliardi
is
not
in
the
dock,
he
has
pleaded
guilty
and
his
case
has
been
disposed
off."
we
will,
therefore
go
forward
with
the
trial
of
the
case
of
commonwealth
v.
dechristoforo
that
is
detained
also
in
the
appendix
record
of
page
99.
at
that
time
consistent
with
what
the
petitioners
suggests
with
the
admirable
trial
tactics
of
defense
council,
no
objection
was
made
to
that
remark,
no
instruction
was
ask
and
no
instruction
was
given.
thereafter,
respondents’
council
proceeded
with
his
closing
arguments
to
the
jury.
the
prosecutors’
argument
as
is
the
custom
in
massachusetts
followed
the
defense
council’s
closing
argument.
and
at
the
beginning,
i
hesitate
to
read
to
the
court
and
yet,
i
am
reluctant
to
read
a
single
remark
to
this
court
without
reading
some
of
the
context
in
which
that
single
remark
occurred.
mr.
david
a.
mills
from
petitioner’s
brief
your
honor
at
page
9.
the
prosecutor’s
closing
remarks
and
its
entirety
appears
in
the
record
appendix.
the
prosecutor’s
closing
argument
let
me
prefess
my
argument
by
saying
that
first
of
all,
i
am
aware
that
when
i
say
is
really
an
argument
because
the
word
argument
pre
supposes
that
i
am
prejudice
to
the
cause
that
i
represent
which
of
course
i
am.
i
think
that
the
very
nature
of
the
system
being
advisory
pitting
one
side
against
the
other
naturally
make
you
point
to
those
things
which
you
think
support
your
particular
position
and
to
more
or
less
ignore
those
things
which
i
supposed
detracked
from
it.
i
would
like
to
skip
down
one
paragraph
and
i
will
seize
reading.
and
i
realize
that
my
closing
argument
should
be
in
no
way
conceited
by
you
as
any
evidence
in
the
case
and
i
am
sure
that
you
won’t
consider
it
as
that
and
i
am
sure
that
my
opening
statement
to
you
is
in
no
way
evidence
in
the
case
and
it
won’t
be
conceited
by
you
as
evidence.
the
prosecutor
in
his
argument,
the
assistant
district
attorney
then
went
on
to
explain
to
the
jury
his
version
of
the
case
but
suffice
it
to
say
that
he
argued
to
the
jury.
his
argument
is
included
in
full
in
the
record
appendix.
during
that
argument
and
the
assistant
district
attorney
made
a
statement
which
is
contained
in
all
of
the
paper
in
this
case
and
in
petitioners
brief
at
page
11,
i
do
not
know
what
they
want
you
to
do
by
way
of
a
verdict.
they
said
that
they
hope
you
find
him
not
guilty.
i
quite
frankly
think
that
they
hope
that
you
find
him
guilty
of
something
a
little
less
than
first-degree
murder.
an
objection
to
this
remark
was
immediately
made
and
although
the
record
is
not
completely
clear
on
the
point
and
i
respectfully
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
the
record
appendix
at
page
129.
at
that
point,
mr.
smith
said
i
object
to
that.
the
court
said
i
do
not
think
mr.
smith
that
is
not
fair
argument.
the
court
know
mr.
smith
that
isn’t
so.
i
think
to
see
and
he
say
that
the
assistant
district
attorney
then
proceeded
with
his
argument
talking
about
another
topic.
the
record
shows
that
the
trial
judge
indicated
that
had
an
objection
that
the
objection
had
in
fact
been
sustained
and
that
had
counsel
requested
instruction
at
that
time,
they
would
have
been
given.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
he
is
an
assistant
attorney
general
in
massachusetts
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
mills
it
is,
yes
your
honor.
now
following
--
may
i
please
the
court,
following
that
closing
argument
of
the
assistant
district
attorney,
the
defendant,
now
respondent
in
this
court,
was
allowed
to
make
an
unsworn
statement
to
the
jury.
thereafter
follow
the
instructions
of
the
court.
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor
it
does.
although,
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
any
such
thing
anymore
in
massachusetts
called
an
unsworn
statement.
mr.
david
a.
mills
in
1969,
yes
your
honor.
the
judge
in
his
charge
first
i
think
it’s
only
fair
to
say
something
about
instructions
that
were
requested
by
the
defendants
now
respondents
counsel
specific
instructions
to
the
jury
by
way
of
a
writing
were
made
to
the
court,
they
are
also
contained
in
the
record's
appendix.
the
court
did
not
give
the
specific
instructions
that
were
requested
by
defendant’s
counsel.
the
court
charge
the
jury
and
the
portion
of
the
charge
which
we
wish
this
court
to
consider
is
contained
on
page
142
of
the
record
appendix,
given
the
fact
that
the
defendant’s
unsworn
statement
had
been
the
most
immediate
proceeding
event
in
the
trial
following
the
charge,
the
trial
judge
and
we
suggest
properly
first
commented
upon
the
unsworn
statement,
basically
saying
that
we
suggest
that
it
is
not
evidence.
and
at
page
143,
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
begging
the
court’s
indulgence
for
permission
to
read
his
instruction.
let
me
begin
this
charge
by
saying
to
you
that
as
i
have
said
with
regard
to
unsworn
statements
not
subject
to
cross-examination
of
the
defendant,
it
is
not
evidence,
nor
are
arguments
of
counsel
nor
the
opening
of
counsel
whether
it
be
the
assistant
district
attorney
in
this
case
or
whether
it
be
mr.
smith.
it
is
not
evidence
for
your
consideration.
opening
of
counsel
made
by
either
the
district
attorney
or
mr.
smith
on
behalf
of
his
client
are
not
evidence,
but
they
are
merely
for
statement
by
the
district
attorney
or
by
mr.
smith
the
defense
counsel
for
which
they
respectively
hope
to
prove.
drop
down
two
lines
to
the
next
full
paragraph,
excuse
me
your
honors.
the
closing
arguments
tool
madame
and
gentleman
of
the
jury,
the
counsel
often
becomes
over
zealous.
closing
arguments
are
not
evidence
for
your
consideration.
closing
arguments
madame
and
gentleman
are
merely
statements
by
the
respective
counsel
as
to
how
they
hope
you
will
view
the
evidence
of
which
you
have
heard
and
now
with
particular
reference
to
that
paragraph
of
instructions
beginning
at
page
at
the
bottom
of
page
143
of
the
record
appendix.
the
judge
continued.
now
in
his
closing
with
district
attorney,
i
noted
made
a
statement.
i
don’t
know
what
they
want
you
to
do
by
way
of
a
verdict.
they
said
they’ve
hope
that
you
find
him
not
guilty.
i
quiet
frankly
think
that
they
hope
you
find
him
guilty
of
something
a
little
less
than
first-degree
murder.
there
is
no
evidence
of
that
whatsoever.
of
course,
you
are
instructed
to
disregard
that
statement
made
by
the
district
attorney
consider
the
case
as
there
is
no
such
statement
was
made.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
of
murder
in
the
first-degree
with
a
recommendation
of
the
death
penalty
not
to
be
imposed
and
verdicts
of
guilty
on
each
of
two
counts
of
a
firearms
charge.
the
case
prior
to
appeal
in
the
state
courts
are
the
defendant
move
for
a
new
trial
in
the
state
courts
and
the
case
was
then
appeal
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
of
the
commonwealth
on
several
assignments
of
error
including
an
assignment
of
the
denial
of
the
defendant’s
motion
for
mistrial.
in
other
words,
the
question
of
the
propriety
and
the
alleged
prejudice
of
the
remarks
made
by
assistant
district
attorney
in
his
closing
will
brought
to
the
full
court
in
massachusetts.
mr.
david
a.
mills
your
honor,
interestingly
enough,
the
only
identification
about
weapon
as
to
any
particular
defendant
had
to
do
with
the
position
of
the
weapon
in
the
car
and
the
fact
that
one
weapon
was
found
in
an
area
with
the
driver
gagliardi
had
left
for
after
being
questioned
by
the
police
and
the
record
explicitly
shows
that
all
identification
had
been
previously
removed
from
the
firearms.
the
case
was
seasonal
re-appealed
to
the
supreme
judicial
court
on
this
question
and
the
court
by
a
solid
majority
and
over
a
various
strenuous
and
explicit
dissent
by
our
chief
justice
which
was
concurred
by
another
justice
concluded
that
the.
and
i
should
know
excuse
me
your
honors
that
our
court,
the
supreme
judicial
court,
anonymously
noted
the
impropriety
of
this
remarks
and
soundly
condemn
them.
finding
however
that
the
argument
as
a
whole
did
not
require
a
mistrial
and
i
would
like
to
suggest
the
criteria
that
the
court
used
in
coming
to
its
conclusion
and
they
are
of
course,
contained
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
judicial
court
which
is
reprinted
inform
the
record
appendix.
mr.
david
a.
mills
unique
in
what,
excuse
me
your
honor?
mr.
david
a.
mills
unique
in
the
sense
that
if
it’s
also
contained
in
your
closing
statement
your
honor,
we
suggest
that
it
perhaps
is
unique.
the
supreme
judicial
court
explicitly
examined
the
whole
argument
and
the
whole
trial
proceeding
consistent
with
an
obligation
on
the
massachusetts
law
that
in
capital
cases,
the
entire
trial
proceeding
be
examined.
the
supreme
judicial
court
examined
the
judge’s
instructions,
the
lack
of
an
immediate
request
for
instructions
after
some
of
the
remarks
were
made.
mr.
david
a.
mills
i
suggest
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
your
honor
that
respondent’s
count,
excuse
me,
defendants
counsel
could
not
have
continued
his
objection
in
requested
a
bench
conference
at
that
junction
in
the
instruction
as
he
had
at
various
portion
in
the
trial,
and
it
should
be
noted
that
as
additional
components
of
this
trial
objection
numbering
approximately
200
were
made
and
105
explicit
exceptions
noted
on
the
record
of
this
trial.
so,
it
was
not
a
trial
with
inactivity
of
the
fact
of
defendant’s
counsel.
mr.
david
a.
mills
i
can
only
--
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
your
honor,
but
i
can
only
suggest
that
there
are
lobby
conferences
and
bench
conferences.
lobby
conferences
would
be
in
the
judge’s
office
perhaps
for
setting
ground
rules
and
schedules
of
trial.
a
bench
conference
is
during
the
course
of
live
testimony
in
the
court
room.
the
supreme
judicial
court,
our
supreme
judicial
court
also
noted
the
weight
of
the
evidence
that
had
been
introduced
against
the
accused
and
the
improbability
that
a
jury
in
massachusetts
withdraw
the
settle
inferences
that
have
been
suggested
by
the
defendant
in
the
state
court,
in
the
federal
district
court
that
have
been
adopted
by
the
circuit
court
and
that
i
suggested
before
this
court
today.
i
have
noted
the
dissent,
i
am
sure
of
our
chief
justice
to
the
majority
opinion
in
massachusetts.
a
petition
to
habeas
corpus
was
filed
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
massachusetts,
the
petition,
the
return;
the
memorandum
of
united
states
magistrate
davis
and
the
transcript
of
the
arguments
before
the
district
judge
on
this
petition
are
contained
in
whole
in
the
appendix.
the
petition
was
denied
without
prejudice.
the
district
judge
concluding
with
respect
to
the
claim
of
prejudice
based
upon
the
assistant
district
attorney’s
remarks.
the
prosecutor’s
arguments
were
not
so
prejudicial
as
to
deprive
the
petitioner
of
his
constitutional
right
to
a
fair
trial.
on
appeal
to
the
circuit
court,
the
court
concerned
itself
and
concerned
itself
explicitly
solely
with
what
the
petitioner
claim
had
been
improper
argument
by
the
prosecuting
attorney.
and
determine
that
the
particular
remark,
i
do
not
know
what
they
want
you
to
do
by
way
of
a
verdict,
when
read
in
the
light
of
the
proceeding
instruction
of
the
jury
at
the
time
of
the
plea
of
co-defendant
gagliardi
in
effect
amounted
to
a
representation
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
to
the
jury
that
their
defendant
dechristoforo
had
offered
to
plead
guilty
and
that
his
plea
had
been
rejected.
the
parties
stipulated
before
the
circuit
court
after
argument
in
this
case
that
no
offered
to
plea
had
been
solicited.
that
no
offered
of
plea
had
been
made
and
that
the
defendant
insisted
upon
a
trial
at
all
times,
and
this
is
contained
within
the
text
of
the
circuit
court’s
opinion.
the
circuit
court
vacated
the
order
often
district
court.
the
primary
points
that
the
petitioner
suggest
to
this
court
this
morning
is
it
the
court
of
appeals
failed
to
fairly
consider
the
entire
trial
of
the
respondent
in
concluding
that
this
remark
when
read
in
the
light
of
an
early
instruction
deprive
to
him
with
a
fair
trial.
in
this
regard,
we
refer
again
to
the
105
exceptions,
to
the
12
or
14
witnesses,
to
the
7
days
of
trial,
to
the
view,
to
the
bill
of
particulus,
to
the
pre
trial
discovery,
to
all
of
the
items
that
have
been
mentioned
including
the
items
that
had
been
mentioned
in
this
court’s
december
decision
of
cupp
v.
naughten
which
is
the
court
recalls
involve
the
question
of
a
particular
instruction
by
a
trial
judge
and
a
standard
of
review.
we
suggest
that
the
standard
of
review
which
has
been
applicable
in
lower
federal
courts
including
our
first
circuit
in
the
patriotic
case
which
is
cited
in
the
brief
makes
it
incumbent
upon
the
circuit
court
and
the
district
court.
if
it
is
to
examine
an
allegation
of
impropriety
by
a
state
prosecutor
to
examine
all
of
the
trial
and
not
to
look
at
one
particular
remark
in
a
vacuum.
we
suggest
that
it
may
not
have
been
an
absolute
vacuum,
but
when
compared
to
the
standard
of
review
employed
by
our
own
supreme
judicial
court
when
it
examine
this
cas.
we
suggest
that
the
examination
tended
by
the
circuit
court
was
a
virtual
vacuum
because
although
it
examined
one
additional
earlier
instruction.
we
do
not
feel
that
that
court
adequately
examined
the
entire
trial
and
that
this
is
a
basis
of
error.
additionally,
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
david
a.
mills
yes,
your
honor.
the
entire
--
mr.
david
a.
mills
well
explicitly,
the
court
did
not
say
that
they
looked
at
that
your
honor
and
stated
--
i
suppose
the
petitioner
would
have
felt
better
if
the
court
said
it
had
examined
all
of
the
trial
your
honor
including
all
of
the
components
of
the
trial.
and
the
court
did
explicitly
say
at
the
outset
that
we
are
concerned
solely
with
what
petitioner
contends
were
improper
proposing
argument.
the
circuit
court,
the
petitioners
suggest
was
also
an
error
on
the
basis
of
certain
premises
that
it
used
in
reaching
its
conclusion
that
this
remark
was
effectively
a
representation
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
to
the
jury
that
the
defendant
had
offered
to
plea
and
his
plea
had
been
rejected.
first
of
the
circuit
court
without
any
foundation
in
the
record
suggested
that
the
co-defendant’s
plea
was
a
plea
to
second
degree
murder.
the
court
further
suggested
that
a
jury
must
always
want
it
to
some
extent
why
a
defendant
has
not
pleaded.
we
suggest
there
is
no
basis
for
this
in
a
record
and
that
it
isn’t
unfair
conclusion
to
draw
with
respect
to
a
jury
that
a
defendant.
excuse
me,
that
a
jury
knows
that
that
the
defendant
who
has
not
sought
to
plead,
even
did
not
wish
to
plead
or
he
was
deterred
by
the
belief
that
the
prosecutor
would
be
unreceptive.
a
sophistication
and
attributing
to
the
jury
knowledge
and
belief
that
we
do
not
feel
is
supported
by
the
record
and
it’s
not
fairly
attributed
to
a
massachusetts
jury.
the
circuit
court
also
suggested
that
the
jury
doesn’t
know
whether
or
not
a
defendants
offer
a
plea
has
been
made
and
refuse,
but
the
jury
knows
that
the
prosecutor
knows
and
we
suggest
that
this
is
violative
factually
of
the
stipulation
that
was
entered
into
by
the
parties
before
that
court.
we
suggested
that
the
first
circuit
has
concluded
that
jury
bargain,
excuse
me,
plea
bargaining
takes
place
in
all
criminal
trials
in
massachusetts
and
we
suggest
there
was
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
that
and
nothing
in
this
particular
case.
indeed,
the
parties
stipulated
that
no
offer
of
plea
had
been
accepted
and,
excuse
me,
no
offer
to
plead
had
been
made
and
no
offer
how
they
plea
had
been
solicited.
and
finally
with
respect
to
the
argument
by
the
respondent
that
what
was
substantially
done
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
was
a
misrepresentation
of
fact
that
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
did
not
believe
what
he
said.
when
he
made
an
improper
statement
of
opinion
to
the
jury
that
he
did
not
believe
what
he
said.
we
suggest
that
if
the
circuit
court
were
to
engage
in
speculation.
it
would
have
been
more
reasonable
to
speculate
that
is
a
matter
of
massachusetts
law
based
upon
the
elements
of
manslaughter
as
contained
in
massachusetts
cases.
the
improper
suggestion
of
opinion
by
the
assistant
district
attorney
was
referring
to
manslaughter
and
in
fact
was
an
opinion.
