mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
events
in
this
case
began
three
years
ago
this
month.
in
early
february
of
1971,
metropolitan
police
officer
marrion
green
was
told
by
a
reliable
informer
that
lonnie
gooding,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
was
selling
narcotics
from
his
home.
mr.
green
investigated
and
on
february
9,
1971,
using
this
purportedly
reliable
informer,
caused
a
controlled
or
supervised
buy
to
be
made,
and
apparently
the
informer
bought
a
small
amount
of
narcotics.
two
days
later
on
february
11,
officer
green,
having
been
satisfied
that
a
violation
of
federal
law
was
probably
taking
place,
made
application
to
the
united
states
magistrate
for
the
district
of
columbia
for
a
search
warrant.
this
application
had
been
approved
by
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
as
an
application
under
federal
law
for
violations
of
the
federal
narcotics
laws.
the
magistrate
so-found
after
reviewing
the
affidavits
and
issued
a
search
warrant,
and
he
did
direct
the
search
could
be
executed
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night.
officer
green
and
six
--
other
metropolitan
police
officers
on
the
evening
of
february
12,
1971
did
enter
mr.
gooding’s
apartment
and
did
find
various
narcotics
and
of
narcotic
influence.
as
a
result
thereof,
mr.
gooding
was
indicted
for
violation
of
federal
narcotics
laws
and
that’s
where
we
stand
today.
the
search
here
was
a
search
for
violations
of
the
federal
law
by
the
members
of
the
metropolitan
police.
no
--
at
no
time
during
the
application
for
the
search
warrant
or
in
the
investigation
was
there
any
indication
that
a
violation
of
metropolitan
--
of
the
district
of
columbia
code
was
involved.
the
entire
search
and
the
entire
process
was
geared
to
find
--
searching
out
for
violations
of
federal
narcotics
laws
and
probable
cause
having
been
shown
in
a
search
warrant,
because
of
those
alleged
violations,
was
issued.
we
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
in
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
on
the
basis
that
the
federal
nighttime
--
the
federal
narcotic
search
warrant
procedure
standard
had
to
be
modified
by
the
district
of
columbia
code
for
reformat
provisions
in
title
xxiii.
the
government
appealed
and
the
three
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals,
although
all
voting
to
reverse,
nonetheless
all
reached
different
opinions.
each
judge
determined
that
21
u.s.c.
879
(a)
was
the
controlling
standard
because
this
was
a
search
for
violations
of
federal
law.
judge
wilkey
who
wrote
the
majority
opinion
indicated
that
if
the
magistrate
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
narcotics
could
be
found
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night,
then
section
879
(a)
authorized
him
to
direct
execution
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night.
judge
fahy
interpreted
the
statue
a
little
bit
differently.
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
section
879
(a),
narcotic
searches
have
been
governed
by
former
18
u.s.c.
section
1405.
that
law
was
well
settled.
if
the
magistrate
had
probable
cause
to
issue
the
basic
warrant
itself,
he
could
authorize
its
service
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night
without
any
further
findings.
judge
fahy
felt
that
section
18
--
section
1405
was
carried
forward
right
into
section
879
(a).
so,
all
the
magistrate
had
to
find
was
probable
cause
with
the
warrant
itself,
and
if
he
made
that
finding,
he
could
authorize
nighttime
service
without
anything
more.
judge
robinson,
in
effect,
dissented
in
principle
from
his
colleagues.
he
felt
that
the
last
seven
words
of
section
879
(a)
and
for
its
service
at
such
time
meant
something.
it
meant
that
the
magistrate
had
to
be
presented
with
and
had
to
find
some
justification
for
a
nighttime
search.
the
police
had
to
offer
some
good
reason
why
they
needed
to
go
into
a
person’s
home
at
night
as
opposed
to
going
in
at
the
daytime.
he
concluded
that
the
police
had
to
show
some
form
of
reasonable
cause
or
exigent
circumstances
before
they
could
be
authorized
to
get
a
nighttime
warrant.
he
felt
that
the
statute
itself,
it
was
plain
on
its
face
as
to
that
requirement
although
it’s
true
the
statute
does
not
spell
out
the
particulars
that
one
has
to
show,
but
then
on
the
other
hand,
neither
does
this
court’s
recently
revised
rule
41
state
what
is
“reasonable
cause
shown”
for
a
nighttime
search.
so,
it’s
obviously
within
the
competence
of
a
court
to
make
those
findings.
judge
robinson,
however,
even
though
the
government
below
had
conceded
that
this
warrant
would
not
need
any
particularized
showing,
nevertheless
held
that
it
satisfied
his
interpretation
of
section
879
(a),
and
he
voted
to
sustain
the
warrant
and
to
reverse
the
district
judge.
we
believe
there
are
two
basic
issues
to
present
here
today.
the
first
is
this
court
must
decide
whether
this
search
is
governed
by
21
u.s.c.
879
(a)
or
whether
it’s
governed
by
23
d.c.
code
sections
521,
522,
or
523.
once
that
decision
is
made,
the
court
must
then
determine
whether
the
warrant
meets
the
tests
of
the
statute
which
it
so
selects.
there
are
good
reasons
why
either
of
the
statutory
procedures
could
be
determined
to
be
the
one
that
is
the
guiding
one.
for
example,
section
879
(a)
is
in
the
united
states
code,
it’s
federal
law.
it
concerns
itself
with
violations
of
the
federal
narcotics
laws
and,
indeed,
here
we
have
a
search
for
violations
of
the
federal
narcotics
laws.
moreover,
a
united
states
magistrate
issued
it.
in
effect,
he
was
issuing
a
federal
warrant
in
this
case.
the
whole
search
has
the
aura
of
a
federal
search,
and
that’s
one
good
reason,
most
likely
why
each
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
determined
that
897
(a)
should
be
the
controlling
standard.
on
the
other
hand,
it
may
be
that
title
xxiii
of
the
d.c.
code
which
became
effective
february
1,
1971
should
be
the
controlling
standard.
the
entire
investigation,
search
warrant
application,
and
search
were
conducted
solely
by
members
of
the
district
of
columbia
police.
there
were
no
federal
officers
of
any
type
in
any
way
involved.
it’s
clear
from
reading
chapter
5
of
title
xxiii
of
the
d.c.
code
that
the
imp
--
that
the
provisions
are
broad
enough
to
authorize
the
district
of
columbia
police
to
apply
for
and
receive
warrants
issued
for
violations
of
federal
law.
moreover,
congress,
when
it
passed
this
law,
thought
it
was
passing
a
complete
and
comprehensive
code
of
criminal
procedure
for
the
district
of
columbia
and,
obviously,
since
the
district
of
columbia
police
are
our
only
local
police
force
it
seems
logical
that
any
search
warrant
that
they
apply
for
under
federal
law
should
be
governed
by
the
provisions
of
then
recently
enacted
title
xxiii.
the
government,
however,
suggests
that
this
search
should
be
governed
by
title
xxxiii,
section
414
of
the
district
of
columbia
code.
that
section
is
found
in
the
district
of
columbia’s
uniform
narcotic
drug
act.
all
three
judges
below
rejected
the
argument
that
section
414
could
govern
this
search.
for
example,
judge
robinson
indicated
that
the
local
provisions,
that
is
title
xxxiii,
extends
only
to
searches
based
on
suspected
narcotics
transmissions
of
the
district’s
own
drug
laws.
here,
every
warrant
document
indicates
that
the
search
was
conducted
for
violations
of
the
federal
narcotics
laws.
no
party
to
this
search
warrant
application,
its
issuance,
or
its
execution
had
any
inkling
that
the
search
might
be
governed
by
title
xxxiii
of
the
district
of
columbia
code.
now,
the
government
is
seeking
that
this
warrant
be
governed
by
title
xxxiii
because
there’s
a
strong
possibility
that
it
was
invalid
for
nighttime
search.
now
we
believe
that
it’s
highly
improper
at
this
time
to
transform
the
warrant
from
a
federal
warrant
into
a
d.c.
warrant,
especially
since
the
government
wants
to
do
it
to
justify
the
search.
the
government
has
to
stand
or
fall
on
the
four
corners
of
the
warrant,
and
every
corner
of
that
warrant
is
marked
federal
law,
26
u.s.c.
section
4704.
moreover,
the
procedure
regularities
of
a
varying
search
warrant
procedure
codes
must
be
adhered
to
and
it’s
important
that,
in
this
respect,
that
the
magistrate
know
under
what
search
warrant
provision
he’s
being
asked
to
issue
a
warrant.
once
this
court
determines
which
search
warrant
procedure
this
warrant
should
be
tested
by,
the
task
then
becomes
determining
does
the
warrant
need
that
test.
if
the
warrant
is
governed
by
title
xxiii
of
the
district
of
columbia
code,
the
answer
is
clear,
the
warrant
is
invalid.
the
government
doesn’t
argue
to
the
contrary.
the
warrant,
on
its
face,
shows
that
the
requisite
requirements
of
title
xxiii
were
not
met.
they’re
spelled
out
very
specifically
in
the
statute,
and
there’s
no
indication
anywhere
in
the
warrant
papers
that
any
of
those
circumstances
existed.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
yes,
the
government
for
the
first
time
in
this
entire
case
is
saying
that
9:30
at
night,
some-four
hours
after
sunset,
is
not
night.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
yes.
we’re
not
contesting
that
the
warrant
would
be
invalid
for
daytime
search
under
10
--
xxiii.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
now,
if
the
court
decides
that
section
879
(a)
is
the
standard,
then
we
also
believe
that
the
warrant
is
defective.
we
believe
that
the
plain
language
of
section
879
(a)
requires
some
showing
beyond
basic
probable
cause
for
the
warrant
itself
to
justify
intrusion
into
a
man’s
home
at
night.
had
congress
intended
to
carry
forward
the
interpret
--
former
section
1405,
it’s
obvious
it
would’ve
carried
it
forward
intact
without
changing
it
except
expanding
the
types
of
drugs,
narcotics,
and
other
substances
to
which
it
applied.
the
government
failed
to
do
this,
and
congress
failed
to
do
this.
instead,
it
issued
a
statute
which,
on
its
face,
says
there
has
to
be
something
more
for
a
nighttime
servoce.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
no,
we’re
not
--
we
did
advocate
that
to
the
court
of
appeals,
but
as
we’ve
indicated
in
the
reply
brief,
we’re
not
advancing
that
argument
here.
we’re
contending
that
879
(a)
requires
some
additional
showing
and
it
may
be
unfortunate
that
congress
didn’t
spell
it
out
like
it
did
in
the
d.c.
code.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
an
additional
showing
of
why
you
need
--
why
the
police
needs
to
go
into
a
man’s
home
at
night.
reasonable
cause
shown,
as
the
test
this
court
has
set
forth
in
rule
41.
judge
robinson
said
--
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
that
may
be
one
reason
why
you
can’t
do
it.
i
mean,
the
standards
in
521
are
some
of
the
obvious
reasons
why
you
need
a
nighttime
search
warrant
as
opposed
to
a
daytime
search
warrant,
but
congress
didn’t
limit
it,
didn’t
say
anything
about
what
the
standards
would
be,
but
those
would
certainly
be
reasonable
standards.
it’s
a
reasonable
test,
and
we
believe
that
there
has
to
be
some
showing
of
exigency,
some
need.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
that’s
correct.
thus,
we
don’t
believe
that
879
(a)
is
ambiguous
in
the
sense
of
not
saying
what
congress
intended.
the
only
thing
missing
are
the
particulars,
but
that
is
not
fatal
because
we
all
--
this
court
always
has
to
interpret
what
probable
cause
means
under
the
fourth
amendment
or
a
statutory
--
or
statutes
authorizing
search
warrants
and
also,
under
the
rule
41,
you’re
going
to
have
to
interpret
what
“reasonable
cause
shown”
means.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
that
is
correct.
they
may
be
directed
solely
to
district
of
columbia
police
and
for
violations
of
--
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
right.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
no,
i
believe,
and
i’d
have
to
double
check,
i
believe
there’s
a
definition
that
means
a
state
court
judge
too.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
if
it
does
say
state
court
judge,
and
i
think
it
would
have
to
include
a
district
of
columbia
superior
court
judge
too
because
the
district
of
columbia
is
defined
as
a
state
in
this
act.
it’s
the
legislative
history
in
this
case
that
causes
the
ambiguities
and
we
believe
that
since
the
statute
is
clear
on
its
face,
that
it
requires
some
additional
showing,
there’s
no
need
to
resort
to
the
legislative
history.
moreover,
that
legislative
history
doesn’t
supply
any
standards
by
governing
what
justifies
a
nighttime
search.
thus,
it
really
adds
nothing
and
it,
in
fact,
just
confuses
the
entire
issue.
we
also
contend
that
this
warrant
does
not
satisfy
section
879
(a)
as
we
interpret
that
statute
and,
here,
we
differ
from
judge
robinson.
first
of
all,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
government
conceded
that
this
warrant
contains
none
of
the
particularities
which
might
beg
--
might
be
required
by
an
interpretation
of
879
(a)
in
which
it’s
found
at
879
(a)
requires
more
than
former
section
1405.
the
government
does
not
acknowledge
that
concession
here,
but
it
certainly
made
it
to
the
court
of
appeals.
secondly,
there’s
just
no
justification
in
this
record
for
a
nighttime
search.
speed
is
obviously
not
an
issue.
the
controlled
buy
was
made
on
february
9.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
one
could
construe
that
grammatically.
however,
given
that
this
country’s
history
and
the
common
law’s
dislike
of
nighttime
searches,
i
think
--
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
right,
i
agree.
when
you
look
at
that
it
would
say
you’d
have
to
show
something
for
daytime
search
too,
but
we
believe
that
since
search
warrants
--
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
no.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
yes,
because
night
is
--
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
night
is
always
the
--
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
night
is
always
the
exception
and,
under
the
common
law,
you
couldn’t
serve
search
warrants
at
night
so
--
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
to
that
extent,
yes.
in
this
case,
the
government
--
the
police
officers
had
obviously
no
need
for
speed.
they
were
in
no
rush.
the
controlled
buy
was
made
on
february
9,
the
warrant
was
applied
for
on
february
11,
and
the
search
was
conducted
on
february
12.
all
these
were
in
the
same
days.
all
these
were
days
of
the
week
in
the
same
week.
there
were
no
intervening
weekends.
moreover,
judge
robinson
suggests
that
there’s
some
evidence
that
mr.
gooding
was
conducting
a
drug
peddling
operation.
we
believe
that
there’s
just
insufficient
evidence
of
that
and
we,
of
course,
don’t
concede
that’s
a
justification
to
go
in
at
night
in
any
case.
we
don’t
know
the
volume
of
narcotics
mr.
gooding
was
purportedly
selling.
we
don’t
know
from
the
warrant
the
volume
of
narcotics
he
had
in
his
home
at
the
time
the
informer
went
in
to
make
the
controlled
buy.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
the
informant
said
mr.
gooding
is
selling
narcotics
from
his
home,
and
you
could
say
“it
seems
to
me
the
informant
could
say,
based
on
his
knowledge,
he’s
selling
a
lot
of
narcotics
or
he’s
selling
only
to
close
friends.”
secondly,
the
informant
told
the
police
officer
that
the
narcotics
were
kept
in
a
green
lady’s
handbag.
it
may
be
that
the
informer
could
have
seen
the
volume
of
narcotics
in
that
--
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
lady’s
green
handbag.[laughter]
well,
i
think
he
said
it
that
way.[laughter]
so,
i
think
the
informant
could’ve
given
some
more
particulars
on
the
volume.
i
mean,
if
you’re
going
to
cut
out
a
classification
of
people
who
aren’t
entitled
to
the
--
to
protections
from
nighttime
searches
making
a
person
who’s
in
the
supermarket
sale
of
narcotics,
i
think
you’re
going
to
have
--
there
has
to
be
more
shown,
and
there’s
just
--
that’s
just
not
indicated
here.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
i
mean,
as
to
--
well,
one
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
thought
so.
the
majority
didn’t.
they
said
there’s,
in
effect,
no
--
congress
has
said
there’s
no
difference
between
day
and
night.
however
--
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
yes,
he
did,
and
we
think
he
erred
there
because
there
just
weren’t
sufficient
findings
below,
plus
the
fact
the
government
had
conceded
that
this
warrant
did
not
have
anything
of
a
particularized
nature
justifying
a
nighttime
search.
finally,
the
government
is
alleging,
is
claiming
here
that
should
the
petitioner
prevail,
nonetheless,
the
evidence
should
not
be
suppressed.
we
believe
that
congress
has
established
search
warrant
standards
and
if
those
standards
are
not
enforced
to
the
suppression
mechanism,
then
the
will
of
congress
is
going
to
be
frustrated.
congressionally
created
procedures
are
just
as
important
as
the
constitutional
procedures,
and
they
must
be
met,
they
must
be
enforced.
moreover,
recently
in
the
calandra
case
we
believe
that
this
court
reinforced
the
continuing
validity
of
the
“weeks”
rule
for
suppression
of
evidence
at
trial
that
was
unlawfully
seized
when
it’s
being
used
against
the
person
from
whom
it
seized,
and
that’s
precisely
our
case.
we’re
not
asking
this
court
to
expand
the
exclusionary
rule
in
any
respect.
we’re
just
asking
it
to
continue
its
enforcement
as
it
has
in
the
past
to
suppress
the
evidence
from,
evidence
which
is
unlawfully
seized.
the
fact
that
the
magistrate
may
have
misunderstood
the
law
is
not
grounds,
in
our
view,
to
create
an
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule.
in
ad
valorem
spinelli,
the
magistrate
misunderstood
the
law.
the
police
came
to
him
in
good
faith
and
made
an
affidavit,
and
the
magistrate
thought
it
was
sufficient.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
that’s
correct.
we
don’t
believe
that
you
can
make
that
distinction.
for
example,
in
miller
versus
united
states
the
police
made
a
no-knock
entry
in
violation
of
the
us
code
statute.
this
court
held
that
the
evidence
must
be
suppressed
because
of
the
illegality
of
the
entry.
so,
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
case
that
suggests
the
fact
that
a
statutory
procedure
is
violated,
is
worthy
of
less
protection
than
when
a
constitutional
procedure
is
violated.
it
appears
that
if
the
warrant
is
invalid,
either
because
it
violates
the
constitution
or
it
violates
some
statutory
requirement,
then
the
search
must
be
invalidated
and
the
evidence
must
be
suppressed.
thus,
we
don’t
believe
that
this
good
faith
argument
should
be
granted
because
any
time
the
magistrate
makes
a
mistake
of
law
the
government
is
going
to
claim
“well,
everybody
was
in
good
faith.”
but,
that’s
not
the
case
because
if
the
magistrate
makes
a
mistake,
then
the
paper
he
is
issuing
is
really
just
a
piece
of
paper.
it
really
isn’t
a
warrant.
it’s
invalid
and
the
whole
purpose
of
having
a
magistrate
is
to
make
sure
that
the
police
have
established
probable
cause
and
complied
with
all
the
statutory
requisites
before
they
enter
a
person’s
home.
hence,
for
these
reasons,
we’re
asking
the
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
contrary
to
what
mr.
frey
suggests,
the
magistrate
was
issuing
a
federal
warrant
for
violation
of
federal
law.
when
you
look
at
the
warrant
in
the
original
district
court
record,
it’s
a
federal
warrant.
when
you
look
at
the
background
materials
that
were
presented
to
the
magistrate,
it’s
a
federal
warrant.
indeed,
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
mr.
justice
brennan,
implicitly
rejected
the
argument
that
section
33-414
of
the
d.c.
code
would
govern.
the
argument
that
the
government
has
made
in
this
case,
both
here
and
below,
were
also
made
in
the
thomas
case,
that
is,
the
warrant
should
be
tested
by
title
xxxiii
section
414
of
the
d.c.
code.
that
court
elected
not
to
do
so,
and
i
don’t
believe
it
said
specifically,
but
it
certainly
means
that
in
this
conflict
situation
they
held
this
to
be,
in
effect,
a
federal
warrant
because
they
said
section
879
(a)
governs
it.
we
have
the
exact
same
situation
here,
d.c.
police
getting
a
warrant.
the
district
of
columbia
code
said
“okay,
section
879
(a)
governs.”
our
code,
33-414,
doesn’t
govern.
i
think
that’s
kind
of
your
state
law
interpretation
that
this
court
ought
to
give
great
deference
to
in
interpreting
this
warrant.
i
think
both
the
legislative
history
of
section
879
(a)
and
recently
revised
rule
41
gives
this
court
no
guidance
as
to
what
standards
“reasonable
cause
shown
or
probable
cause
were
at
service
at
such
time”
means.
don’t
think
that
means
that
an
argument
could
be
used
to
say
that
this
court
did
not
mean
that
you
had
to
make
some
showing
for
nighttime
search
when
you
get
the
case
in
asking
for
an
interpretation
of
rule
41.
similarly,
the
fact
that
the
legislative
history
of
section
879
(a)
does
not
give
any
indication
of
possible
standards
does
not
mean
that
congress
did
not
intend
some
additional
showing
for
nighttime
service
to
be
required
by
the
police
and
the
magistrates.
thank
you.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
yes.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
events
in
this
case
began
three
years
ago
this
month.
in
early
february
of
1971,
metropolitan
police
officer
marrion
green
was
told
by
a
reliable
informer
that
lonnie
gooding,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
was
selling
narcotics
from
his
home.
mr.
green
investigated
and
on
february
9,
1971,
using
this
purportedly
reliable
informer,
caused
a
controlled
or
supervised
buy
to
be
made,
and
apparently
the
informer
bought
a
small
amount
of
narcotics.
two
days
later
on
february
11,
officer
green,
having
been
satisfied
that
a
violation
of
federal
law
was
probably
taking
place,
made
application
to
the
united
states
magistrate
for
the
district
of
columbia
for
a
search
warrant.
this
application
had
been
approved
by
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
as
an
application
under
federal
law
for
violations
of
the
federal
narcotics
laws.
the
magistrate
so-found
after
reviewing
the
affidavits
and
issued
a
search
warrant,
and
he
did
direct
the
search
could
be
executed
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night.
officer
green
and
six
--
other
metropolitan
police
officers
on
the
evening
of
february
12,
1971
did
enter
mr.
gooding’s
apartment
and
did
find
various
narcotics
and
of
narcotic
influence.
as
a
result
thereof,
mr.
gooding
was
indicted
for
violation
of
federal
narcotics
laws
and
that’s
where
we
stand
today.
the
search
here
was
a
search
for
violations
of
the
federal
law
by
the
members
of
the
metropolitan
police.
no
--
at
no
time
during
the
application
for
the
search
warrant
or
in
the
investigation
was
there
any
indication
that
a
violation
of
metropolitan
--
of
the
district
of
columbia
code
was
involved.
the
entire
search
and
the
entire
process
was
geared
to
find
--
searching
out
for
violations
of
federal
narcotics
laws
and
probable
cause
having
been
shown
in
a
search
warrant,
because
of
those
alleged
violations,
was
issued.
we
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence
in
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
on
the
basis
that
the
federal
nighttime
--
the
federal
narcotic
search
warrant
procedure
standard
had
to
be
modified
by
the
district
of
columbia
code
for
reformat
provisions
in
title
xxiii.
the
government
appealed
and
the
three
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals,
although
all
voting
to
reverse,
nonetheless
all
reached
different
opinions.
each
judge
determined
that
21
u.s.c.
879
(a)
was
the
controlling
standard
because
this
was
a
search
for
violations
of
federal
law.
judge
wilkey
who
wrote
the
majority
opinion
indicated
that
if
the
magistrate
had
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
narcotics
could
be
found
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night,
then
section
879
(a)
authorized
him
to
direct
execution
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night.
judge
fahy
interpreted
the
statue
a
little
bit
differently.
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
section
879
(a),
narcotic
searches
have
been
governed
by
former
18
u.s.c.
section
1405.
that
law
was
well
settled.
if
the
magistrate
had
probable
cause
to
issue
the
basic
warrant
itself,
he
could
authorize
its
service
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night
without
any
further
findings.
judge
fahy
felt
that
section
18
--
section
1405
was
carried
forward
right
into
section
879
(a).
so,
all
the
magistrate
had
to
find
was
probable
cause
with
the
warrant
itself,
and
if
he
made
that
finding,
he
could
authorize
nighttime
service
without
anything
more.
judge
robinson,
in
effect,
dissented
in
principle
from
his
colleagues.
he
felt
that
the
last
seven
words
of
section
879
(a)
and
for
its
service
at
such
time
meant
something.
it
meant
that
the
magistrate
had
to
be
presented
with
and
had
to
find
some
justification
for
a
nighttime
search.
the
police
had
to
offer
some
good
reason
why
they
needed
to
go
into
a
person’s
home
at
night
as
opposed
to
going
in
at
the
daytime.
he
concluded
that
the
police
had
to
show
some
form
of
reasonable
cause
or
exigent
circumstances
before
they
could
be
authorized
to
get
a
nighttime
warrant.
he
felt
that
the
statute
itself,
it
was
plain
on
its
face
as
to
that
requirement
although
it’s
true
the
statute
does
not
spell
out
the
particulars
that
one
has
to
show,
but
then
on
the
other
hand,
neither
does
this
court’s
recently
revised
rule
41
state
what
is
“reasonable
cause
shown”
for
a
nighttime
search.
so,
it’s
obviously
within
the
competence
of
a
court
to
make
those
findings.
judge
robinson,
however,
even
though
the
government
below
had
conceded
that
this
warrant
would
not
need
any
particularized
showing,
nevertheless
held
that
it
satisfied
his
interpretation
of
section
879
(a),
and
he
voted
to
sustain
the
warrant
and
to
reverse
the
district
judge.
we
believe
there
are
two
basic
issues
to
present
here
today.
the
first
is
this
court
must
decide
whether
this
search
is
governed
by
21
u.s.c.
879
(a)
or
whether
it’s
governed
by
23
d.c.
code
sections
521,
522,
or
523.
once
that
decision
is
made,
the
court
must
then
determine
whether
the
warrant
meets
the
tests
of
the
statute
which
it
so
selects.
there
are
good
reasons
why
either
of
the
statutory
procedures
could
be
determined
to
be
the
one
that
is
the
guiding
one.
for
example,
section
879
(a)
is
in
the
united
states
code,
it’s
federal
law.
it
concerns
itself
with
violations
of
the
federal
narcotics
laws
and,
indeed,
here
we
have
a
search
for
violations
of
the
federal
narcotics
laws.
moreover,
a
united
states
magistrate
issued
it.
in
effect,
he
was
issuing
a
federal
warrant
in
this
case.
the
whole
search
has
the
aura
of
a
federal
search,
and
that’s
one
good
reason,
most
likely
why
each
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
below
determined
that
897
(a)
should
be
the
controlling
standard.
on
the
other
hand,
it
may
be
that
title
xxiii
of
the
d.c.
code
which
became
effective
february
1,
1971
should
be
the
controlling
standard.
the
entire
investigation,
search
warrant
application,
and
search
were
conducted
solely
by
members
of
the
district
of
columbia
police.
there
were
no
federal
officers
of
any
type
in
any
way
involved.
it’s
clear
from
reading
chapter
5
of
title
xxiii
of
the
d.c.
code
that
the
imp
--
that
the
provisions
are
broad
enough
to
authorize
the
district
of
columbia
police
to
apply
for
and
receive
warrants
issued
for
violations
of
federal
law.
moreover,
congress,
when
it
passed
this
law,
thought
it
was
passing
a
complete
and
comprehensive
code
of
criminal
procedure
for
the
district
of
columbia
and,
obviously,
since
the
district
of
columbia
police
are
our
only
local
police
force
it
seems
logical
that
any
search
warrant
that
they
apply
for
under
federal
law
should
be
governed
by
the
provisions
of
then
recently
enacted
title
xxiii.
the
government,
however,
suggests
that
this
search
should
be
governed
by
title
xxxiii,
section
414
of
the
district
of
columbia
code.
that
section
is
found
in
the
district
of
columbia’s
uniform
narcotic
drug
act.
all
three
judges
below
rejected
the
argument
that
section
414
could
govern
this
search.
for
example,
judge
robinson
indicated
that
the
local
provisions,
that
is
title
xxxiii,
extends
only
to
searches
based
on
suspected
narcotics
transmissions
of
the
district’s
own
drug
laws.
here,
every
warrant
document
indicates
that
the
search
was
conducted
for
violations
of
the
federal
narcotics
laws.
no
party
to
this
search
warrant
application,
its
issuance,
or
its
execution
had
any
inkling
that
the
search
might
be
governed
by
title
xxxiii
of
the
district
of
columbia
code.
now,
the
government
is
seeking
that
this
warrant
be
governed
by
title
xxxiii
because
there’s
a
strong
possibility
that
it
was
invalid
for
nighttime
search.
now
we
believe
that
it’s
highly
improper
at
this
time
to
transform
the
warrant
from
a
federal
warrant
into
a
d.c.
warrant,
especially
since
the
government
wants
to
do
it
to
justify
the
search.
the
government
has
to
stand
or
fall
on
the
four
corners
of
the
warrant,
and
every
corner
of
that
warrant
is
marked
federal
law,
26
u.s.c.
section
4704.
moreover,
the
procedure
regularities
of
a
varying
search
warrant
procedure
codes
must
be
adhered
to
and
it’s
important
that,
in
this
respect,
that
the
magistrate
know
under
what
search
warrant
provision
he’s
being
asked
to
issue
a
warrant.
once
this
court
determines
which
search
warrant
procedure
this
warrant
should
be
tested
by,
the
task
then
becomes
determining
does
the
warrant
need
that
test.
if
the
warrant
is
governed
by
title
xxiii
of
the
district
of
columbia
code,
the
answer
is
clear,
the
warrant
is
invalid.
the
government
doesn’t
argue
to
the
contrary.
the
warrant,
on
its
face,
shows
that
the
requisite
requirements
of
title
xxiii
were
not
met.
they’re
spelled
out
very
specifically
in
the
statute,
and
there’s
no
indication
anywhere
in
the
warrant
papers
that
any
of
those
circumstances
existed.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
yes,
the
government
for
the
first
time
in
this
entire
case
is
saying
that
9:30
at
night,
some-four
hours
after
sunset,
is
not
night.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
yes.
we’re
not
contesting

mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
now,
if
the
court
decides
that
section
879
(a)
is
the
standard,
then
we
also
believe
that
the
warrant
is
defective.
we
believe
that
the
plain
language
of
section
879
(a)
requires
some
showing
beyond
basic
probable
cause
for
the
warrant
itself
to
justify
intrusion
into
a
man’s
home
at
night.
had
congress
intended
to
carry
forward
the
interpret
--
former
section
1405,
it’s
obvious
it
would’ve
carried
it
forward
intact
without
changing
it
except
expanding
the
types
of
drugs,
narcotics,
and
other
substances
to
which
it
applied.
the
government
failed
to
do
this,
and
congress
failed
to
do
this.
instead,
it
issued
a
statute
which,
on
its
face,
says
there
has
to
be
something
more
for
a
nighttime
servoce.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
no,
we’re
not
--
we
did
advocate
that
to
the
court
of
appeals,
but
as
we’ve
indicated
in
the
reply
brief,
we’re
not
advancing
that
argument
here.
we’re
contending
that
879
(a)
requires
some
additional
showing
and
it
may
be
unfortunate
that
congress
didn’t
spell
it
out
like
it
did
in
the
d.c.
code.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
an
additional
showing
of
why
you
need
--
why
the
police
needs
to
go
into
a
man’s
home
at
night.
reasonable
cause
shown,
as
the
test
this
court
has
set
forth
in
rule
41.
judge
robinson
said
--
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
that
may
be
one
reason
why
you
can’t
do
it.
i
mean,
the
standards
in
521
are
some
of
the
obvious
reasons
why
you
need
a
nighttime
search
warrant
as
opposed
to
a
daytime
search
warrant,
but
congress
didn’t
limit
it,
didn’t
say
anything
about
what
the
standards
would
be,
but
those
would
certainly
be
reasonable
standards.
it’s
a
reasonable
test,
and
we
believe
that
there
has
to
be
some
showing
of
exigency,
some
need.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
that’s
correct.
thus,
we
don’t
believe
that
879
(a)
is
ambiguous
in
the
sense
of
not
saying
what
congress
intended.
the
only
thing
missing
are
the
particulars,
but
that
is
not
fatal
because
we
all
--
this
court
always
has
to
interpret
what
probable
cause
means
under
the
fourth
amendment
or
a
statutory
--
or
statutes
authorizing
search
warrants
and
also,
under
the
rule
41,
you’re
going
to
have
to
interpret
what
“reasonable
cause
shown”
means.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
that
is
correct.
they
may
be
directed
solely
to
district
of
columbia
police
and
for
violations
of
--
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
right.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
no,
i
believe,
and
i’d
have
to
double
check,
i
believe
there’s
a
definition
that
means
a
state
court
judge
too.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
if
it
does
say
state
court
judge,
and
i
think
it
would
have
to
include
a
district
of
columbia
superior
court
judge
too
because
the
district
of
columbia
is
defined
as
a
state
in
this
act.
it’s
the
legislative
history
in
this
case
that
causes
the
ambiguities
and
we
believe
that
since
the
statute
is
clear
on
its
face,
that
it
requires
some
additional
showing,
there’s
no
need
to
resort
to
the
legislative
history.
moreover,
that
legislative
history
doesn’t
supply
any
standards
by
governing
what
justifies
a
nighttime
search.
thus,
it
really
adds
nothing
and
it,
in
fact,
just
confuses
the
entire
issue.
we
also
contend
that
this
warrant
does
not
satisfy
section
879
(a)
as
we
interpret
that
statute
and,
here,
we
differ
from
judge
robinson.
first
of
all,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
government
conceded
that
this
warrant
contains
none
of
the
particularities
which
might
beg
--
might
be
required
by
an
interpretation
of
879
(a)
in
which
it’s
found
at
879
(a)
requires
more
than
former
section
1405.
the
government
does
not
acknowledge
that
concession
here,
but
it
certainly
made
it
to
the
court
of
appeals.
secondly,
there’s
just
no
justification
in
this
record
for
a
nighttime
search.
speed
is
obviously
not
an
issue.
the
controlled
buy
was
made
on
february
9.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
one
could
construe
that
grammatically.
however,
given
that
this
country’s
history
and
the
common
law’s
dislike
of
nighttime
searches,
i
think
--
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
right,
i
agree.
when
you
look
at
that
it
would
say
you’d
have
to
show
something
for
daytime
search
too,
but
we
believe
that
since
search
warrants
--
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
no.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
yes,
because
night
is
--
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
night
is
always
the
--
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
night
is
always
the
exception
and,
under
the
common
law,
you
couldn’t
serve
search
warrants
at
night
so
--
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
to
that
extent,
yes.
in
this
case,
the
government
--
the
police
officers
had
obviously
no
need
for
speed.
they
were
in
no
rush.
the
controlled
buy
was
made
on
february
9,
the
warrant
was
applied
for
on
february
11,
and
the
search
was
conducted
on
february
12.
all
these
were
in
the
same
days.
all
these
were
days
of
the
week
in
the
same
week.
there
were
no
intervening
weekends.
moreover,
judge
robinson
suggests
that
there’s
some
evidence
that
mr.
gooding
was
conducting
a
drug
peddling
operation.
we
believe
that
there’s
just
insufficient
evidence
of
that
and
we,
of
course,
don’t
concede
that’s
a
justification
to
go
in
at
night
in
any
case.
we
don’t
know
the
volume
of
narcotics
mr.
gooding
was
purportedly
selling.
we
don’t
know
from
the
warrant
the
volume
of
narcotics
he
had
in
his
home
at
the
time
the
informer
went
in
to
make
the
controlled
buy.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
well,
the
informant
said
mr.
gooding
is
selling
narcotics
from
his
home,
and
you
could
say
“it
seems
to
me
the
informant
could
say,
based
on
his
knowledge,
he’s
selling
a
lot
of
narcotics
or
he’s
selling
only
to
close
friends.”
secondly,
the
informant
told
the
police
officer
that
the
narcotics
were
kept
in
a
green
lady’s
handbag.
it
may
be
that
the
informer
could
have
seen
the
volume
of
narcotics
in
that
--
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
lady’s
green
handbag.[laughter]
well,
i
think
he
said
it
that
way.[laughter]
so,
i
think
the
informant
could’ve
given
some
more
particulars
on
the
volume.
i
mean,
if
you’re
going
to
cut
out
a
classification
of
people
who
aren’t
entitled
to
the
--
to
protections
from
nighttime
searches
making
a
person
who’s
in
the
supermarket
sale
of
narcotics,
i
think
you’re
going
to
have
--
there
has
to
be
more
shown,
and
there’s
just
--
that’s
just
not
indicated
here.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
i
mean,
as
to
--
well,
one
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
thought
so.
the
majority
didn’t.
they
said
there’s,
in
effect,
no
--
congress
has
said
there’s
no
difference
between
day
and
night.
however
--
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
yes,
he
did,
and
we
think
he
erred
there
because
there
just
weren’t
sufficient
findings
below,
plus
the
fact
the
government
had
conceded
that
this
warrant
did
not
have
anything
of
a
particularized
nature
justifying
a
nighttime
search.
finally,
the
government
is
alleging,
is
claiming
here
that
should
the
petitioner
prevail,
nonetheless,
the
evidence
should
not
be
suppressed.
we
believe
that
congress
has
established
search
warrant
standards
and
if
those
standards
are
not
enforced
to
the
suppression
mechanism,
then
the
will
of
congress
is
going
to
be
frustrated.
congressionally
created
procedures
are
just
as
important
as
the
constitutional
procedures,
and
they
must
be
met,
they
must
be
enforced.
moreover,
recently
in
the
calandra
case
we
believe
that
this
court
reinforced
the
continuing
validity
of
the
“weeks”
rule
for
suppression
of
evidence
at
trial
that
was
unlawfully
seized
when
it’s
being
used
against
the
person
from
whom
it
seized,
and
that’s
precisely
our
case.
we’re
not
asking
this
court
to
expand
the
exclusionary
rule
in
any
respect.
we’re
just
asking
it
to
continue
its
enforcement
as
it
has
in
the
past
to
suppress
the
evidence
from,
evidence
which
is
unlawfully
seized.
the
fact
that
the
magistrate
may
have
misunderstood
the
law
is
not
grounds,
in
our
view,
to
create
an
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule.
in
ad
valorem
spinelli,
the
magistrate
misunderstood
the
law.
the
police
came
to
him
in
good
faith
and
made
an
affidavit,
and
the
magistrate
thought
it
was
sufficient.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
that’s
correct.
we
don’t
believe
that
you
can
make
that
distinction.
for
example,
in
miller
versus
united
states
the
police
made
a
no-knock
entry
in
violation
of
the
us
code
statute.
this
court
held
that
the
evidence
must
be
suppressed
because
of
the
illegality
of
the
entry.
so,
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
case
that
suggests
the
fact
that
a
statutory
procedure
is
violated,
is
worthy
of
less
protection
than
when
a
constitutional
procedure
is
violated.
it
appears
that
if
the
warrant
is
invalid,
either
because
it
violates
the
constitution
or
it
violates
some
statutory
requirement,
then
the
search
must
be
invalidated
and
the
evidence
must
be
suppressed.
thus,
we
don’t
believe
that
this
good
faith
argument
should
be
granted
because
any
time
the
magistrate
makes
a
mistake
of
law
the
government
is
going
to
claim
“well,
everybody
was
in
good
faith.”
but,
that’s
not
the
case
because
if
the
magistrate
makes
a
mistake,
then
the
paper
he
is
issuing
is
really
just
a
piece
of
paper.
it
really
isn’t
a
warrant.
it’s
invalid
and
the
whole
purpose
of
having
a
magistrate
is
to
make
sure
that
the
police
have
established
probable
cause
and
complied
with
all
the
statutory
requisites
before
they
enter
a
person’s
home.
hence,
for
these
reasons,
we’re
asking
the
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
contrary
to
what
mr.
frey
suggests,
the
magistrate
was
issuing
a
federal
warrant
for
violation
of
federal
law.
when
you
look
at
the
warrant
in
the
original
district
court
record,
it’s
a
federal
warrant.
when
you
look
at
the
background
materials
that
were
presented
to
the
magistrate,
it’s
a
federal
warrant.
indeed,
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals,
mr.
justice
brennan,
implicitly
rejected
the
argument
that
section
33-414
of
the
d.c.
code
would
govern.
the
argument
that
the
government
has
made
in
this
case,
both
here
and
below,
were
also
made
in
the
thomas
case,
that
is,
the
warrant
should
be
tested
by
title
xxxiii
section
414
of
the
d.c.
code.
that
court
elected
not
to
do
so,
and
i
don’t
believe
it
said
specifically,
but
it
certainly
means
that
in
this
conflict
situation
they
held
this
to
be,
in
effect,
a
federal
warrant
because
they
said
section
879
(a)
governs
it.
we
have
the
exact
same
situation
here,
d.c.
police
getting
a
warrant.
the
district
of
columbia
code
said
“okay,
section
879
(a)
governs.”
our
code,
33-414,
doesn’t
govern.
i
think
that’s
kind
of
your
state
law
interpretation
that
this
court
ought
to
give
great
deference
to
in
interpreting
this
warrant.
i
think
both
the
legislative
history
of
section
879
(a)
and
recently
revised
rule
41
gives
this
court
no
guidance
as
to
what
standards
“reasonable
cause
shown
or
probable
cause
were
at
service
at
such
time”
means.
don’t
think
that
means
that
an
argument
could
be
used
to
say
that
this
court
did
not
mean
that
you
had
to
make
some
showing
for
nighttime
search
when
you
get
the
case
in
asking
for
an
interpretation
of
rule
41.
similarly,
the
fact
that
the
legislative
history
of
section
879
(a)
does
not
give
any
indication
of
possible
standards
does
not
mean
that
congress
did
not
intend
some
additional
showing
for
nighttime
service
to
be
required
by
the
police
and
the
magistrates.
thank
you.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
yes.
mr.
herbert
a.
rosenthal,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
