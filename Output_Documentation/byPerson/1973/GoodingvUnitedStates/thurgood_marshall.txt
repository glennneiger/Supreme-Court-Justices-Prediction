but
these
were
police
officers,
city
police
officers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
could
they
be
executing
a
federal
warrant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
did
you
tell
the
magistrate?
i’m
very
worried
about
this
going
to
a
magistrate.
was
the
magistrate
issuing
a
federal
or
a
state
warrant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
federal
or
state?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
it
was
valid
under
one,
it
was
good,
and
if
it
was
valid
in
the
other
--
is
that
quite
[coughing]
business?
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
--
in
a
state,
like
the
state
of
maryland,
could
the
state
of
maryland
issue
a
search
warrant
for
a
violation
of
a
federal
code?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
a
state
magistrate
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
this
is
just
state
officer.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
--
as
i
understand,
it’s
the
government’s
position
that
you’re
making
the
district
of
columbia
stay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
the
state
--
i’m
taking
as
a
state
like
maryland,
and
i
have
never
heard
of
a
state
magistrate
issuing
a
search
warrant
for
the
violation
of
a
federal
offense
to
a
state
officer.
i’ve
never
heard
of
it.
now,
i’m
not
saying
it’s
not
done.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
magistrate
in
washington
a
federal
magistrate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
well,
there’s
no
[inaudible]
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they
had
a
whole
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
had
a
whole
day
to
execute
it
and
they
didn’t.
they
waited
until
the
night.
how
is
that
talking
about
it
completely?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don’t
know
that’s
one
way
or
the
other,
but
i’m
saying
you
say
that
the
officer
has
no
responsibility
at
all,
only
the
magistrate.
i
say
that
if
magistrate
had
been
wrong,
and
given
the
night,
the
officers
could’ve
corrected
it
and
enforce
it
in
the
day.
that’s
all
i’m
saying.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
they
serve
it
in
the
day
and
the
night?
he
says
--
“you
serve
it
any
time
you
want
to
serve”
that
is
what
the
magistrate
said,
“and
it’s
up
to
you
to
determine
when
you
want
to
serve
it,”
and
the
police
officers
decided
that
they
would
rather
serve
it
at
night
for
some
reason
unknown
to
you
and
me.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
didn’t
justice
harlan
said
that
it’s
difficult
to
have
to
enforce
it
during
the
day
and,
in
the
privacy
of
the
nighttime,
you
can
do
a
private
arrest.
