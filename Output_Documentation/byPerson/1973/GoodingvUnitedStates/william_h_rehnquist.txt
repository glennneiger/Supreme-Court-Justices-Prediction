wouldn’t
that
be
a

the

making
the

in

i
wonder
if
either
of

has
the

authoritative

in
construing
the

reorganization
act
and
the
enactment
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
no
matter
what
the
courts
would
say
in
this
particular
case,
you’re
still
going
to
get
arguments
before
magistrates
and
in
subsequent
opinions
as
to
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
proper
showing
of
validity
for
a
nighttime
search
if
the
court
should
adopt
that
proposition.
justice
william

rehnquist
this
case
comes
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
that
court
had
reversed
the
decision
of
the
district
court,
which
granted
petitioner
gooding's
motion
to
suppress
evidence
found
during
a
search
of
his
apartment.
the
search
in
question
took
place
at
09:30
pm
on
february
12,
1971.
members
of
the
metropolitan
police
department
had
obtained
a
warrant
from
a
united
states
magistrate,
which
authorized
them
to
search
for
violations
of
specified
sections
of
the
federal
drug
laws.
the
warrant
specified
that
the
the
search
might
be
carried
out
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night.
the
search
was
conducted
entirely
by
members
of
the
metropolitan
police
department.
prior
to
his
trial
on
two
federal
drug
accounts
petitioner
made
a
motion
to
suppress
the
evidence,
discovered
during
the
search
of
his
apartment,
contending
that
the
application
for
the
warrant
did
not
comply
with
provisions
of
the
district
of
columbia
code,
which
he
contended
required
a
special
showing
of
need
in
order
to
search
at
night.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion,
finding
that
the
district
of
columbia
code
provisions
were
applicable
and
rejecting
the
government's
argument
that
the
search
was
valid
under
provisions
of
the
united
states
court,
governing
searches
for
controlled
substances.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
that
court,
although
somewhat
divided
in
its
reasoning,
held
that
the
united
states
code
provision,
section
879
(a)
was
applicable
and
that
its
requirements
have
been
satisfied
here.
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
deciding
that
the
federal
provision
was
the
applicable
provision
in
this
case
and
we
also
agree
that
its
requirements
had
been
satisfied.
the
warrant
was
issued
by
a
united
states
magistrate
for
violations
of
the
federal
drug
laws
and
the
fact
that
it
was
sought
and
executed
by
metropolitan
police
officers,
does
not
by
itself
mean
that
the
search
should
be
governed
by
the
local
code
provisions.
judged
by
the
standards
for
federal
drug
searches,
we
find
that
the
warrant
was
valid.
although
the
language
of
the
federal
statute
allowing
searches
for
drugs
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night,
if
the
judge
or
a
united
states
magistrate
is
satisfied
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
grounds
exist
for
the
warrant
and
for
its
service
at
such
time,
might
at
first
glance
seem
to
require
a
special
showing
for
night
time
searches.
we
believe
closer
study
of
the
language
in
the
relevant
legislative
history
do
not
support
that
reading.
we
therefore
hold
that
879
(a)
requires
no
special
showing
for
a
search
at
night
other
than
a
showing
that
the
contraband
is
likely
to
be
on
the
property
of
person
to
be
searched
to
that
time.
