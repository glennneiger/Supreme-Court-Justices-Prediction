mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
district
of
columbia
police
officers
executed
a
narcotics
search
warrant
at
9:30
in
the
evening.
in
so
doing,
they
were
complying
fully
with
the
command
of
the
magistrate
in
the
warrant.
the
magistrate
had,
in
issuing
the
warrant,
expressly
authorized
its
execution
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night.
the
application
for
the
warrant,
recited
facts
which
it
is
not
disputed,
established
probable
cause
with
respect
to
an
offense
under
title
xxvi
of
the
us
code.
we
submit
also
that
it
cannot
seriously
be
disputed
that
the
facts
were
cited
in
the
application
for
the
warrant
made
out
in
offense
under
title
xxxiii
of
the
district
of
columbia
code.
the
issue
was
whether
evidence
seized
when
this
warrant
was
executed
in
full
compliance
with
its
terms
should
be
suppressed
because
the
magistrate
erred
in
authorizing
execution
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night.
now,
since
the
facts
were
cited
in
the
application
for
the
warrant
made
out
a
violation
both
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
of
the
united
states
code,
it’s
our
view
that
the
nighttime
execution
was
proper,
if
it
was
proper
under
either
local
district
law
or
under
the
applicable
federal
law.
we
contend
that
it
was
lawful
under
both,
and
we
contend
that
the
choice
is
not
between
the
federal
law
and
title
xxiii
of
the
district
of
columbia
code.
as
i
will
argue,
that
is
simply
a
provision
that
is
not
and
cannot
be
applicable
to
a
narcotics
search
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
they
were,
and
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
section
138
of
title
iv
of
the
d.c.
code
expressly
authorizes
them
to
do
so
and
justice
douglas’
dissent
from
the
denial
of
certiorari
in
the
thomas
case,
and
which
i
believe
you
concurred,
made
that
same
conclusion
that
the
d.c.
police
officers
are,
to
that
extent,
federal
agents
with
a
duty
to
enforce
federal
as
well
as
local
law.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
submit
that
title
xxiii
simply
is
inapplicable.
obviously,
if
title
xxiii
is
applicable,
the
warrant
was
not
--
did
not
properly
authorize
nighttime
execution.
we
submit
that
title
xxiii
cannot
be
applicable
to
a
narcotics
search.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
although
judge
gesell
held
that
it
was
applicable
to
all
searches
by
d.c.
police
officers.
we
submit
that
that
manifestly
can
itself
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
was
issuing
a
search
warrant.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
our
contention
is
that
it
was
a
warrant
authorizing
the
d.c.
police
officers
to
search
mr.
gooding’s
home
and
that
it
cannot
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i’m
not
sure
and,
indeed,
in
view
of
the
way
this
case
has
developed
i
understand
that
it
is
now
--
they
are
now,
as
a
matter
of
course,
reciting
both
the
district
of
columbia
code
and
the
federal
violation
in
the
warrant
application,
but
the
cases
have
held
that
you
need
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i’m
not
clear
whether
mary
--
you
mean
--
there’s
no
question
that
a
maryland
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
a
state
judge
may,
under
rule
41
and
i
think
under
this
provision
of
the
us
code,
may
issue
a
warrant
to
a
federal
officer.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
in
the
case
of
maryland,
i
think
only
a
federal
officer
may
apply.
now,
that
includes
district
of
columbia
police.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
statute
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
simply
--
that
analogy,
i
don’t
think,
is
applicable
to
our
case,
mr.
justice
marshall,
because
we
are
dealing
with
–
we
are
dealing
with
a
warrant
that
was
issued
by
a
federal
magistrate
to
an
officer
who
was,
for
these
purposes,
a
federal
and
a
local
officer.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
he’s
in
the
united
states
courthouse.
i
believe
he
is
a
federal
appointee.
now,
he
is,
under
i
think
section
43
of
title
iv
of
the
d.c.
code
also,
authorized
to
issue
local
search
warrants.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
our
argument,
justice
marshall,
is
that
on
the
face
of
the
application
for
the
search
warrant
certain
facts
were
recited
which
the
magistrate
found
to
be
the
case.
those
facts
make
out
a
violation
of
the
district
of
columbia
code.
they
make
out
a
violation
of
the
united
states
code.
since
it’s
been
held
that
you
need
not
recite
any
provision
that’s
being
violated
in
the
warrant
application
and,
indeed,
the
form
in
the
appendix
to
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
has
no
place
to
put
down
the
provision
that’s
violated
and
since
it’s
been
held
that
you
can
put
down
the
wrong
provision
and
the
warrant
is
not
invalidated,
i
fail
to
see
why
if
you
put
down
another
correct
provision
that
should
preclude
us
from
relying
on
the
district
of
columbia
code.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
certainly.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
do
claim
that
414
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
do
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
that
--
this
requirement
is
clearly
met
on
the
face
of
the
record
because
the
requirement
to
examine
on
oath
and
to
have
affidavits
or
deposition
of
the
witnesses
requires
two
things.
one
is
that
the
magistrate
personally
take
the
oath
of
the
complainant
which
was
done
here,
and
the
second
is
that
the
basis
for
the
warrant
application
be
reduced
to
writing
either
in
the
form
of
an
affidavit
or
in
the
form
of
a
deposition.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
would
be
true
as
to
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
you
don’t
ordinarily.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
you
would
be
deciding
this
case
in
a
rather
artificial
context,
i
think
if
you
ignored
the
fact,
but
you
have
to
recognize
the
fact
that
the
district
of
columbia
code
contains
a
provision
for
narcotics
searches
which
requires
the
magistrate
to
authorize
such
searches
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night.
you
can’t
decide
this
case
as
though
that
provision
doesn’t
exist.
i
am
not
saying
that
the
officers
in
this
case
acted
in
reliance
on
that
provision
when
they
secured
the
warrant
and
i
agree
that,
ordinarily,
you
would
not
take
this
case
to
determine
the
issue
of
whether
they
complied
with
the
title
xxxiii
procedural
requirements.
although
i
don’t
believe
that
issue
was
clearly
argued
to
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
it’s
clear
that
it
was
an
unconsidered
dictum
because
the
considerations
that
bear
on
it
were
not
actually
presented.
now,
with
respect
to
section
8
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
you’re
being
asked
to
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
to
apply
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
[attempt
to
laughter]
no,
we
contend
that
you
should
defer
to
the
rulings
of
the
local
courts
on
questions
of
local
law.
you
are
here
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
one
of
the
questions
that
was
passed
on
below.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
was
a
suggestion
in
the
--
in
judge
fahy's
opinion
that
we
could
not
rely
on
title
xxxiii.
i
don’t
think
this
was
a
holding
of
the
court.
it
was
passed
as
a
comment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
it
would
be
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
now,
in
this
case,
we
are
dealing
--
the
thomas
case
was
an
identical
case
on
its
facts
or
just
about
to
this
case,
and
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
there,
without
really
considering
whether
section
414
could
be
relied
upon,
held
that
you
could
not
look
to
title
xxiii
of
the
district
code
as
providing
the
applicable
standard
and
it
looked
to
title
xxi
of
the
united
states
code
and
held
that
the
nighttime
authorization
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
with
all
respect
justice
brennan,
i
don’t
believe
that
was
a
holding
by
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
on
the
availability
of
414.
they
simply
were
talking
about
the
relative
applicability
of
the
title
xxi
provision
and
the
title
xxiii
provision
without
having
had
presented
to
them
the
argument
that
we
present
to
you.
now,
with
respect
to
section
879
(a),
the
us
code
provision,
unless
there
are
any
specific
questions
i
think
the
necessity
of
a
special
showing
of
exigent
circumstances
or
the
like
for
authorization
of
nighttime
execution
of
a
federal
narcotics
search
warrant
has
been
fully
covered
in
our
briefs
and
in
the
opinions
of
the
two
district
of
columbia
courts
of
appeals.
with
respect
to
title
xxiii,
judge
gesell
held
that
all
warrants
issued
to
district
of
columbia
police
were
subject
to
the
provisions
of
title
xxiii
of
the
d.c.
code
regarding
the
necessity
of
a
special
showing
for
the
authorization
of
nighttime
execution.
now,
we
think
this
position
is
beset
with
insurmountable
difficulties.
in
the
first
place,
in
order
to
avoid
the
impact
of
title
xxxiii,
petitioner
has
had
to
argue
that
this
was
a
federal
warrant
application,
that
it
was
issued
by
a
federal
magistrate,
that
it
was
for
a
violation
of
federal
law.
and
then,
he
says
“well,
if
it
was
okay
under
federal
law,
let’s
put
that
to
one
side
and
let’s
apply
local
law.”
that
is,
he
wants
to
say,
on
the
one
hand,
you
can’t
apply
title
xxxiii
because
this
was
a
federal
warrant
and,
on
the
other
hand,
he
wants
to
say
you
must
apply
title
xxiii
of
the
d.c.
code
because
these
were
district
of
columbia
police
officers.
now,
we
think
that
he
can’t
have
it
both
ways.
also,
the
alleged
policy
basis
for
his
argument
is
completely
undercut
by
the
existence
of
title
xxxiii.
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
you
don’t
consider
properly
before
you
or
you
don’t
wish
to
decide
our
contention
that
this
search
was
valid
under
title
xxxiii.
nevertheless,
what
kind
of
a
policy
do
we
have
reflected
in
title
xxiii,
which
judge
gesell
found,
which
says
that
all
searches
must
be
--
nighttime
searches
must
have
a
special
justification.
if
the
district
of
columbia
police
need
no
special
justification
to
make
a
local
nighttime
narcotics
search
and
to
get
a
warrant
for
that
purpose,
and
if
under
the
federal
law
no
special
justification
is
required,
how
can
it
be
that
the
d.c.
police,
what
policy
is
it
that
makes
the
d.c.
police
make
a
special
justification
for
a
nighttime
warrant
to
enforce
federal
law?
i
think
there
simply
is
no
rational
basis
for
interpreting
title
xxiii
to
impose
such
a
requirement.
now,
i’d
like
to
turn
at
this
point,
if
i
may,
to
the
exclusionary
rule
argument.
let
us
assume
that
the
magistrate
erred
in
directing
the
police
to
execute
this
warrant
at
any
time
in
the
day
or
night,
and
that
alt
least
five
members
of
this
court
of
the
view
that
contrary
to
the
conclusions
of
the
three
appellate
courts
that
have
previously
considered
this
issue,
the
applicable
statutes
require
the
magistrate
to
elicit
a
special
showing
in
support
of
the
nighttime
execution
authorization
that
he
conferred.
does
it
necessarily
follow
that
the
evidence
seized
under
this
warrant
should
be
excluded?
petitioner
contends
that
it
does.
he
argues,
in
effect,
that
any
irregularity
in
the
issuance
or
execution
of
a
search
warrant,
whether
or
not
have
constitutional
dimensions,
whether
or
not
willful
or
flagrant,
whether
or
not
done
only
after
being
expressly
authorized
by
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
must
lead
to
exclusion
of
the
evidence
obtained.
the
primary
reason
he
advances
for
this
view
is
the
necessity
to
avoid
tainting
the
purity
of
our
judicial
process.
now,
we
contend
that
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
this
case
would
represent
an
inappropriate
extension
of
the
rule
to
or
beyond
its
outermost
limits
and
would
seriously
disserve
the
interest
of
justice
and
undermine
the
integrity
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
in
the
first
place,
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
constitutional
violation.
this
is
a
case
in
which
exclusion,
if
there
is
to
be
any,
must
come
from
an
invocation
of
the
court’s
supervisory
powers.
now,
in
the
mcnabb
case
which
is
perhaps
the
leading
case
on
the
question
of
supervisory
powers,
the
court
described
the
occasion
for
the
exercise
of
such
powers
for
exclusion
as
follows,
and
i’m
quoting
from
page
345
of
volume
318.
“plainly,
a
conviction
resting
on
evidence
secured
through
such
a
flagrant
disregard
of
the
procedure
which
congress
has
commanded
cannot
be
allowed
to
stand
without
making
the
courts
themselves
accomplices
in
willful
disobedience
of
law.”
now,
we
contend
that
this
case
does
not
come
anywhere
near
that
standard
for
the
exercise
of
the
court’s
supervisory
power
for
exclusion.
now,
secondly,
we
point
out
that
if
there
was
error
here,
it
was
made
in
good
faith.
the
police
and
the
magistrate
can
hardly
be
accused
of
willful
disobedience
of
a
clear
statutory
mandate
when
eight
of
the
nine
appellate
judges,
who
have
thus
far
expressed
their
views
on
the
question,
uphold
the
propriety
of
the
authorization
of
nighttime
execution
under
facts
such
as
these.
therefore,
the
objective
of
deterrence
of
a
official
misconduct
cannot
possibly
be
furthered
by
the
application
of
an
exclusionary
rule
in
this
case.
finally,
the
error,
if
there
was
an
error,
was
that
of
the
magistrate
and
not
that
of
the
officers.
the
warrant
application
did
not
specifically
request
authorization
for
nighttime
execution.
it
was
the
magistrate
who
directed
that
it’d
be
served
in
any
time
of
the
day
or
night.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
there’s
no
suggestion
here
of
any
improper
motive.
we
simply
don’t
know,
on
this
record,
why
they
executed
it
at
night.
it
may
be
that
mr.
gooding
and
the
narcotics
were
only
present
at
the
apartment
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
--
but
i
think,
justice
marshall,
that
it’s
unrealistic
to
suppose
that
when
the
police
officer
gets
a
command
from
the
magistrate
saying
you
are
commanded
forth
with
to
serve
this
warrant
within
10
days
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
let
me
say
this,
justice
marshall.
it
is
possible
that
the
magistrate
could
authorize
execution
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night
and
that
we
would
agree
with
you
that
a
particular
mode
of
nighttime
execution
was
illegal
not
because
it
violated
a
statute,
but
because
it
was
unreasonable
and
therefore
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
of
course
this
brings
us
to
the
argument
in
the
sense
that,
in
this
particular
case,
on
these
facts
we’re
talking
about
a
kind
of
search
which
this
court
has,
in
october
1972,
determined
would
not
be
considered
a
nighttime
search.
i
want
to
make
my
point.
if
they
went
in
at
3:00
in
the
morning
after
waiting
until
they
were
sure
everybody
was
asleep
with
no
justification
whatsoever
for
doing
that,
then
even
though
the
warrant
had
authorized
nighttime
execution,
we
might
have
a
question
of
an
independent
constitutional
violation,
but
we
are
talking
here
about
a
request
for
suppression
on
the
basis
of
a
statute
and
on
the
basis
of
an
error
by
the
magistrate.
i
think
it
has
not
heretofore
been
suggested
that
the
error
was
that
of
the
police
officers,
and
i
don’t
see
how
if
the
magistrate
made
a
mistake
about
what
the
law
was
in
good
faith,
how
we
can
suppose
that
there
would
be
effect
of
deterrence
of
police
officers
who
presumably
are
far
less
sophisticated
in
their
interpretation
of
a
provision
like
the
21
u.s.c.
879
(a)
than
the
magistrate.
now
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
weeks
was
constitutional
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
violation.
--
violation.
yes,
indeed.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
was
there
a
warrant
in
weeks?
i’m
not
sure
that
i
can
answer
that.
however,
i
would
like
to
advert
to
the
quote
from
weeks
which
you
had
in
your
dissenting
opinion
in
calandra
because
i
think
that
this
highlights
the
difference
between
this
case
and
weeks.
in
weeks
the
court
said,
and
i’m
looking
at
page
3
of
the
calandra
slip
opinion
and
it’s
at
page
394
of
volume
232
us,
“to
sanction
such
proceedings
would
be
to
affirm
by
judicial
decision
a
manifest
neglect
if
not
an
open
defiance
of
the
prohibitions
of
the
constitution.”
now,
we
are
not
talking
in
this
case
about
an
open
defiance,
a
manifest
neglect,
or
a
provision
of
the
constitution.
we’re
talking
about,
at
most,
a
good
faith
mistake
by
the
magistrate.
and,
i
ask
you,
suppose
that
this
warrant--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
presumably
in
so
far
as
he--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
he
probably
believed
that
he
was
entitled
to
the
warrant,
that’s
true.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
do
believe
that
there
is
a
policy
that
favors,
encouraging
the
police
to
go
for
a
warrant,
and
the
jones,
and
willard,
and
ventresca
language
which
we’ve
adverted
to
in
our
brief
clearly
shows
that
when
the
police
go
to
the
magistrate
for
a
warrant,
a
search,
which
otherwise
might
not
be
considered
a
probable
cause
search
and
therefore
a
constitutional
violation,
will
be
considered
a
probable
cause
search
in
a
sense
to
reward
the
police
or
alternatively
at
least
not
to
punish
them,
not
to
hold
them
to
stringent
standards
when
they
have
gone
to
the
magistrate.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
--
i
think
the
language
in
ventresca
suggests
that
it
would
change
the
determination
of
probable
cause.
now,
i
think
we
get
into
a
question
that
we
don’t
have
to
face
in
this
case,
whether
where
you
have
a
good
faith
application
that
reasonably
may
have
been
believed
to
make
out
probable
cause
and
the
magistrate
issues
a
warrant
and
it's
subsequently
determined
that
probable
cause
has
not
been
made
out,
whether
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
appropriate
there,
that’s
not
this
case
because
we’re
not
dealing
with
a
constitutional
violation
in
this
case.
suppose
that
after
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
and
the
d.c.
circuit
had
interpreted
879
(a)
as
requiring
no
special
showing,
we
had
had
the
same
situation
that
arose
in
this
case
and
they
probably
are
cases
where
there
was
nighttime
authorization
in
a
warrant
and
now
the
supreme
court
says
“that’s
a
mistake.
879
(a)
requires
a
special
showing.”
can
it
seriously
be
contended
that
it
will
further
the
interest
of
justice?
that
you
will,
in
the
language
of
justice
brennan
in
calandra,
minimized
the
risk
of
seriously
undermining
popular
trust
in
government
if
you
would
allow
a
defendant
to
go
free
with
suppressing
the
evidence
against
the
defendant
which
was
obtained
in
good
faith
and
relies
on
decisions
of
responsible
courts
of
appeals?
the
miller
case,
which
my
colleague
has
cited
to
you,
which
of
course
is
a
no-knock
entry
case
falls
in
a
completely
different
category.
the
issue
there
was
not
the
validity
of
the
warrant,
but
of
the
manner
of
its
execution.
the
magistrate
did
not
authorize
the
police
in
miller
to
make
a
no-knock
entry.
what’s
more,
i
don’t
think
that
there
was
a
contention
of
good
faith
in
miller.
in
miller,
they
did
something
which
was
held
to
be
unlawful,
breaking
down
the
door
and
going
in.
it’s,
i
think,
a
clearly
distinguishable
situation
than
this.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that’s
right.
in
any
event
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
right.
now,
another
important
point
that
i
want
to
make,
i
think
petitioner
has
misconceived
the
thrust
of
our
argument
in
--
on
the
exclusionary
rule
point
in
one
significant
respect.
if
a
court
now
announces
a
definitive
rule
of
interpretation
under
879
(a)
or
definitive
rule
applicable
to
the
district
of
columbia
police,
we
agree
that
warrants
thereafter
procured
in
violation
of
the
statute
as
construed
by
the
court
would
result
in
seizure
of
excludable
evidence.
at
that
point,
of
course,
we
could
not
make
a
defense
that
this
was
a
good
faith
presentation
of
an
application
to
a
magistrate
which
they
--
which
was
honestly
believed
to
provide
a
basis
for
authorization
of
nighttime
execution.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
true,
and
i
suppose
there
could
be
other
circumstances
in
which
we
would
advance
the
same
argument,
if
they
got
a
warrant.
after
all,
the
exclusionary
rule
is
not
required
to
control
the
conduct
of
magistrates.
magistrates
are
judicial
officers.
they’re
presumably
under
the
control
of
the
judicial
branch
and,
presumably,
there’s
someway
to
get
magistrates
to
obey
the
law
other
than
excluding
evidence
which
the
police
seized
pursuant
to
the
directions
of
the
magistrate.
now,
with
the
nighttime
search
argument,
i
raise
the
issue
and
we
raise
it
in
our
brief
because
it
has
some
importance
beyond
the
confines
of
this
immediate
case,
the
definition
of
what
is
nighttime.
the
court
has
resolved
that
question
with
respect
to
searches
under
rule
41.
however,
it
is
an
open
question
presumably
with
respect
to
searches
governed
by
the
district
of
columbia
code
where
there
is
no
definition
of
nighttime
or
daytime,
and
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it’s
also
presumably
an
open
question
under
the
us
code
provision,
section
879.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
right.
well,
we
are
not
asking
you
to
reach
out
to
the
nighttime
search
issue
if
you
resolve
the
879
(a)
issue
of
our
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
let
me
say
this.
if
you
hold
that
this
was
a
nighttime
search
under
879
(a),
i
think
we
would
not
wish
to
persist
in
our
argument
that
it
would
not
be
a
nighttime
search
under
title
xxiii.
so,
that
doesn’t
become
a
problem.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not
at
all.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not--
i
simply
suggest
that
we
will
withdraw
the
argument
with
respect
to
nighttime
search
under
the
d.c.
code
if
you
find
that
it
was
a
nighttime
search
under
the
federal
code.
if
you
find
that
it
was
not
a
nighttime
search
under
the
federal
code,
you
don’t
have
to
reach
it
under
the
d.c.
code.
however,
i
have
no
doubt
that
what
you
might
say
on
the
federal
code
issue
would
have
some
possible
effect
on
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
that’s
an
inevitable
result
of
the
role
of
this
court.
now,
i
think
one
final
point
with
respect
to
section
879
(a);
we’ve
indicated
in
our
brief
that
the
language
of
that
statute,
when
you
look
at
it
on
its
face
appears
to
support
the
petitioner’s
position.
in
asking
him
questions,
obviously
the
court
was
troubled
by
what
standard
was
for
the
showing
that
would
have
to
be
made,
if
some
showing
has
to
be
made.
now,
presumably
in
order
to
ascertain
the
standard
for
the
showing,
one
has
to
go
to
the
legislative
history
or
at
least
that’s
one
place
one
might
look.
and
when
one
looks
at
the
legislative
history,
one
finds
that
the
kind
of
showing
that
congress
intended
to
be
made
in
this
case
was
no
showing
at
all.
now,
that
creates
somewhat
of
a
conundrum
about
relying
on
what
petitioner
contends
as
the
plain
language
of
879
(a).
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case,
district
of
columbia
police
officers
executed
a
narcotics
search
warrant
at
9:30
in
the
evening.
in
so
doing,
they
were
complying
fully
with
the
command
of
the
magistrate
in
the
warrant.
the
magistrate
had,
in
issuing
the
warrant,
expressly
authorized
its
execution
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night.
the
application
for
the
warrant,
recited
facts
which
it
is
not
disputed,
established
probable
cause
with
respect
to
an
offense
under
title
xxvi
of
the
us
code.
we
submit
also
that
it
cannot
seriously
be
disputed
that
the
facts
were
cited
in
the
application
for
the
warrant
made
out
in
offense
under
title
xxxiii
of
the
district
of
columbia
code.
the
issue
was
whether
evidence
seized
when
this
warrant
was
executed
in
full
compliance
with
its
terms
should
be
suppressed
because
the
magistrate
erred
in
authorizing
execution
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night.
now,
since
the
facts
were
cited
in
the
application
for
the
warrant
made
out
a
violation
both
of
the
district
of
columbia
and
of
the
united
states
code,
it’s
our
view
that
the
nighttime
execution
was
proper,
if
it
was
proper
under
either
local
district
law
or
under
the
applicable
federal
law.
we
contend
that
it
was
lawful
under
both,
and
we
contend
that
the
choice
is
not
between
the
federal
law
and
title
xxiii
of
the
district
of
columbia
code.
as
i
will
argue,
that
is
simply
a
provision
that
is
not
and
cannot
be
applicable
to
a
narcotics
search
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
they
were,
and
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
section
138
of
title
iv
of
the
d.c.
code
expressly
authorizes
them
to
do
so
and
justice
douglas’
dissent
from
the
denial
of
certiorari
in
the
thomas
case,
and
which
i
believe
you
concurred,
made
that
same
conclusion
that
the
d.c.
police
officers
are,
to
that
extent,
federal
agents
with
a
duty
to
enforce
federal
as
well
as
local
law.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
submit
that
title
xxiii
simply
is
inapplicable.
obviously,
if
title
xxiii
is
applicable,
the
warrant
was
not
--
did
not
properly
authorize
nighttime
execution.
we
submit
that
title
xxiii
cannot
be
applicable
to
a
narcotics
search.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
although
judge
gesell
held
that
it
was
applicable
to
all
searches
by
d.c.
police
officers.
we
submit
that
that
manifestly
can
itself
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
was
issuing
a
search
warrant.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
our
contention
is
that
it
was
a
warrant
authorizing
the
d.c.
police
officers
to
search
mr.
gooding’s
home
and
that
it
cannot
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i’m
not
sure
and,
indeed,
in
view
of
the
way
this
case
has
developed
i
understand
that
it
is
now
--
they
are
now,
as
a
matter
of
course,
reciting
both
the
district
of
columbia
code
and
the
federal
violation
in
the
warrant
application,
but
the
cases
have
held
that
you
need
not
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i’m
not
clear
whether
mary
--
you
mean
--
there’s
no
question
that
a
maryland
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
a
state
judge
may,
under
rule
41
and
i
think
under
this
provision
of
the
us
code,
may
issue
a
warrant
to
a
federal
officer.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
in
the
case
of
maryland,
i
think
only
a
federal
officer
may
apply.
now,
that
includes
district
of
columbia
police.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
statute
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
simply
--
that
analogy,
i
don’t
think,
is
applicable
to
our
case,
mr.
justice
marshall,
because
we
are
dealing
with
–
we
are
dealing
with
a
warrant
that
was
issued
by
a
federal
magistrate
to
an
officer
who
was,
for
these
purposes,
a
federal
and
a
local
officer.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
he’s
in
the
united
states
courthouse.
i
believe
he
is
a
federal
appointee.
now,
he
is,
under
i
think
section
43
of
title
iv
of
the
d.c.
code
also,
authorized
to
issue
local
search
warrants.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
our
argument,
justice
marshall,
is
that
on
the
face
of
the
application
for
the
search
warrant
certain
facts
were
recited
which
the
magistrate
found
to
be
the
case.
those
facts
make
out
a
violation
of
the
district
of
columbia
code.
they
make
out
a
violation
of
the
united
states
code.
since
it’s
been
held
that
you
need
not
recite
any
provision
that’s
being
violated
in
the
warrant
application
and,
indeed,
the
form
in
the
appendix
to
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
has
no
place
to
put
down
the
provision
that’s
violated
and
since
it’s
been
held
that
you
can
put
down
the
wrong
provision
and
the
warrant
is
not
invalidated,
i
fail
to
see
why
if
you
put
down
another
correct
provision
that
should
preclude
us
from
relying
on
the
district
of
columbia
code.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
certainly.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
do
claim
that
414
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
do
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
that
that
--
this
requirement
is
clearly
met
on
the
face
of
the
record
because
the
requirement
to
examine
on
oath
and
to
have
affidavits
or
deposition
of
the
witnesses
requires
two
things.
one
is
that
the
magistrate
personally
take
the
oath
of
the
complainant
which
was
done
here,
and
the
second
is
that
the
basis
for
the
warrant
application
be
reduced
to
writing
either
in
the
form
of
an
affidavit
or
in
the
form
of
a
deposition.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that
would
be
true
as
to
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
you
don’t
ordinarily.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
you
would
be
deciding
this
case
in
a
rather
artificial
context,
i
think
if
you
ignored
the
fact,
but
you
have
to
recognize
the
fact
that
the
district
of
columbia
code
contains
a
provision
for
narcotics
searches
which
requires
the
magistrate
to
authorize
such
searches
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night.
you
can’t
decide
this
case
as
though
that
provision
doesn’t
exist.
i
am
not
saying
that
the
officers
in
this
case
acted
in
reliance
on
that
provision
when
they
secured
the
warrant
and
i
agree
that,
ordinarily,
you
would
not
take
this
case
to
determine
the
issue
of
whether
they
complied
with
the
title
xxxiii
procedural
requirements.
although
i
don’t
believe
that
issue
was
clearly
argued
to
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think
it’s
clear
that
it
was
an
unconsidered
dictum
because
the
considerations
that
bear
on
it
were
not
actually
presented.
now,
with
respect
to
section
8
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
you’re
being
asked
to
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
to
apply
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
[attempt
to
laughter]
no,
we
contend
that
you
should
defer
to
the
rulings
of
the
local
courts
on
questions
of
local
law.
you
are
here
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
one
of
the
questions
that
was
passed
on
below.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
was
a
suggestion
in
the
--
in
judge
fahy's
opinion
that
we
could
not
rely
on
title
xxxiii.
i
don’t
think
this
was
a
holding
of
the
court.
it
was
passed
as
a
comment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
it
would
be
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals.
now,
in
this
case,
we
are
dealing
--
the
thomas
case
was
an
identical
case
on
its
facts
or
just
about
to
this
case,
and
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
there,
without
really
considering
whether
section
414
could
be
relied
upon,
held
that
you
could
not
look
to
title
xxiii
of
the
district
code
as
providing
the
applicable
standard
and
it
looked
to
title
xxi
of
the
united
states
code
and
held
that
the
nighttime
authorization
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
with
all
respect
justice
brennan,
i
don’t
believe
that
was
a
holding
by
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
on
the
availability
of
414.
they
simply
were
talking
about
the
relative
applicability
of
the
title
xxi
provision
and
the
title
xxiii
provision
without
having
had
presented
to
them
the
argument
that
we
present
to
you.
now,
with
respect
to
section
879
(a),
the
us
code
provision,
unless
there
are
any
specific
questions
i
think
the
necessity
of
a
special
showing
of
exigent
circumstances
or
the
like
for
authorization
of
nighttime
execution
of
a
federal
narcotics
search
warrant
has
been
fully
covered
in
our
briefs
and
in
the
opinions
of
the
two
district
of
columbia
courts
of
appeals.
with
respect
to
title
xxiii,
judge
gesell
held
that
all
warrants
issued
to
district
of
columbia
police
were
subject
to
the
provisions
of
title
xxiii
of
the
d.c.
code
regarding
the
necessity
of
a
special
showing
for
the
authorization
of
nighttime
execution.
now,
we
think
this
position
is
beset
with
insurmountable
difficulties.
in
the
first
place,
in
order
to
avoid
the
impact
of
title
xxxiii,
petitioner
has
had
to
argue
that
this
was
a
federal
warrant
application,
that
it
was
issued
by
a
federal
magistrate,
that
it
was
for
a
violation
of
federal
law.
and
then,
he
says
“well,
if
it
was
okay
under
federal
law,
let’s
put
that
to
one
side
and
let’s
apply
local
law.”
that
is,
he
wants
to
say,
on
the
one
hand,
you
can’t
apply
title
xxxiii
because
this
was
a
federal
warrant
and,
on
the
other
hand,
he
wants
to
say
you
must
apply
title
xxiii
of
the
d.c.
code
because
these
were
district
of
columbia
police
officers.
now,
we
think
that
he
can’t
have
it
both
ways.
also,
the
alleged
policy
basis
for
his
argument
is
completely
undercut
by
the
existence
of
title
xxxiii.
let
us
assume
for
the
moment
that
you
don’t
consider
properly
before
you
or
you
don’t
wish
to
decide
our
contention
that
this
search
was
valid
under
title
xxxiii.
nevertheless,
what
kind
of
a
policy
do
we
have
reflected
in
title
xxiii,
which
judge
gesell
found,
which
says
that
all
searches
must
be
--
nighttime
searches
must
have
a
special
justification.
if
the
district
of
columbia
police
need
no
special
justification
to
make
a
local
nighttime
narcotics
search
and
to
get
a
warrant
for
that
purpose,
and
if
under
the
federal
law
no
special
justification
is
required,
how
can
it
be
that
the
d.c.
police,
what
policy
is
it
that
makes
the
d.c.
police
make
a
special
justification
for
a
nighttime
warrant
to
enforce
federal
law?
i
think
there
simply
is
no
rational
basis
for
interpreting
title
xxiii
to
impose
such
a
requirement.
now,
i’d
like
to
turn
at
this
point,
if
i
may,
to
the
exclusionary
rule
argument.
let
us
assume
that
the
magistrate
erred
in
directing
the
police
to
execute
this
warrant
at
any
time
in
the
day
or
night,
and
that
alt
least
five
members
of
this
court
of
the
view
that
contrary
to
the
conclusions
of
the
three
appellate
courts
that
have
previously
considered
this
issue,
the
applicable
statutes
require
the
magistrate
to
elicit
a
special
showing
in
support
of
the
nighttime
execution
authorization
that
he
conferred.
does
it
necessarily
follow
that
the
evidence
seized
under
this
warrant
should
be
excluded?
petitioner
contends
that
it
does.
he
argues,
in
effect,
that
any
irregularity
in
the
issuance
or
execution
of
a
search
warrant,
whether
or
not
have
constitutional
dimensions,
whether
or
not
willful
or
flagrant,
whether
or
not
done
only
after
being
expressly
authorized
by
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
must
lead
to
exclusion
of
the
evidence
obtained.
the
primary
reason
he
advances
for
this
view
is
the
necessity
to
avoid
tainting
the
purity
of
our
judicial
process.
now,
we
contend
that
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
in
this
case
would
represent
an
inappropriate
extension
of
the
rule
to
or
beyond
its
outermost
limits
and
would
seriously
disserve
the
interest
of
justice
and
undermine
the
integrity
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
in
the
first
place,
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
constitutional
violation.
this
is
a
case
in
which
exclusion,
if
there
is
to
be
any,
must
come
from
an
invocation
of
the
court’s
supervisory
powers.
now,
in
the
mcnabb
case
which
is
perhaps
the
leading
case
on
the
question
of
supervisory
powers,
the
court
described
the
occasion
for
the
exercise
of
such
powers
for
exclusion
as
follows,
and
i’m
quoting
from
page
345
of
volume
318.
“plainly,
a
conviction
resting
on
evidence
secured
through
such
a
flagrant
disregard
of
the
procedure
which
congress
has
commanded
cannot
be
allowed
to
stand
without
making
the
courts
themselves
accomplices
in
willful
disobedience
of
law.”
now,
we
contend
that
this
case
does
not
come
anywhere
near
that
standard
for
the
exercise
of
the
court’s
supervisory
power
for
exclusion.
now,
secondly,
we
point
out
that
if
there
was
error
here,
it
was
made
in
good
faith.
the
police
and
the
magistrate
can
hardly
be
accused
of
willful
disobedience
of
a
clear
statutory
mandate
when
eight
of
the
nine
appellate
judges,
who
have
thus
far
expressed
their
views
on
the
question,
uphold
the
propriety
of
the
authorization
of
nighttime
execution
under
facts
such
as
these.
therefore,
the
objective
of
deterrence
of
a
official
misconduct
cannot
possibly
be
furthered
by
the
application
of
an
exclusionary
rule
in
this
case.
finally,
the
error,
if
there
was
an
error,
was
that
of
the
magistrate
and
not
that
of
the
officers.
the
warrant
application
did
not
specifically
request
authorization
for
nighttime
execution.
it
was
the
magistrate
who
directed
that
it’d
be
served
in
any
time
of
the
day
or
night.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
there’s
no
suggestion
here
of
any
improper
motive.
we
simply
don’t
know,
on
this
record,
why
they
executed
it
at
night.
it
may
be
that
mr.
gooding
and
the
narcotics
were
only
present
at
the
apartment
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
--
but
i
think,
justice
marshall,
that
it’s
unrealistic
to
suppose
that
when
the
police
officer
gets
a
command
from
the
magistrate
saying
you
are
commanded
forth
with
to
serve
this
warrant
within
10
days
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
let
me
say
this,
justice
marshall.
it
is
possible
that
the
magistrate
could
authorize
execution
at
any
time
of
the
day
or
night
and
that
we
would
agree
with
you
that
a
particular
mode
of
nighttime
execution
was
illegal
not
because
it
violated
a
statute,
but
because
it
was
unreasonable
and
therefore
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
of
course
this
brings
us
to
the
argument
in
the
sense
that,
in
this
particular
case,
on
these
facts
we’re
talking
about
a
kind
of
search
which
this
court
has,
in
october
1972,
determined
would
not
be
considered
a
nighttime
search.
i
want
to
make
my
point.
if
they
went
in
at
3:00
in
the
morning
after
waiting
until
they
were
sure
everybody
was
asleep
with
no
justification
whatsoever
for
doing
that,
then
even
though
the
warrant
had
authorized
nighttime
execution,
we
might
have
a
question
of
an
independent
constitutional
violation,
but
we
are
talking
here
about
a
request
for
suppression
on
the
basis
of
a
statute
and
on
the
basis
of
an
error
by
the
magistrate.
i
think
it
has
not
heretofore
been
suggested
that
the
error
was
that
of
the
police
officers,
and
i
don’t
see
how
if
the
magistrate
made
a
mistake
about
what
the
law
was
in
good
faith,
how
we
can
suppose
that
there
would
be
effect
of
deterrence
of
police
officers
who
presumably
are
far
less
sophisticated
in
their
interpretation
of
a
provision
like
the
21
u.s.c.
879
(a)
than
the
magistrate.
now
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
weeks
was
constitutional
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
violation.
--
violation.
yes,
indeed.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
was
there
a
warrant
in
weeks?
i’m
not
sure
that
i
can
answer
that.
however,
i
would
like
to
advert
to
the
quote
from
weeks
which
you
had
in
your
dissenting
opinion
in
calandra
because
i
think
that
this
highlights
the
difference
between
this
case
and
weeks.
in
weeks
the
court
said,
and
i’m
looking
at
page
3
of
the
calandra
slip
opinion
and
it’s
at
page
394
of
volume
232
us,
“to
sanction
such
proceedings
would
be
to
affirm
by
judicial
decision
a
manifest
neglect
if
not
an
open
defiance
of
the
prohibitions
of
the
constitution.”
now,
we
are
not
talking
in
this
case
about
an
open
defiance,
a
manifest
neglect,
or
a
provision
of
the
constitution.
we’re
talking
about,
at
most,
a
good
faith
mistake
by
the
magistrate.
and,
i
ask
you,
suppose
that
this
warrant--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
excuse
me?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
presumably
in
so
far
as
he--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
he
probably
believed
that
he
was
entitled
to
the
warrant,
that’s
true.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
do
believe
that
there
is
a
policy
that
favors,
encouraging
the
police
to
go
for
a
warrant,
and
the
jones,
and
willard,
and
ventresca
language
which
we’ve
adverted
to
in
our
brief
clearly
shows
that
when
the
police
go
to
the
magistrate
for
a
warrant,
a
search,
which
otherwise
might
not
be
considered
a
probable
cause
search
and
therefore
a
constitutional
violation,
will
be
considered
a
probable
cause
search
in
a
sense
to
reward
the
police
or
alternatively
at
least
not
to
punish
them,
not
to
hold
them
to
stringent
standards
when
they
have
gone
to
the
magistrate.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
the
--
i
think
the
language
in
ventresca
suggests
that
it
would
change
the
determination
of
probable
cause.
now,
i
think
we
get
into
a
question
that
we
don’t
have
to
face
in
this
case,
whether
where
you
have
a
good
faith
application
that
reasonably
may
have
been
believed
to
make
out
probable
cause
and
the
magistrate
issues
a
warrant
and
it's
subsequently
determined
that
probable
cause
has
not
been
made
out,
whether
the
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
appropriate
there,
that’s
not
this
case
because
we’re
not
dealing
with
a
constitutional
violation
in
this
case.
suppose
that
after
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals
and
the
d.c.
circuit
had
interpreted
879
(a)
as
requiring
no
special
showing,
we
had
had
the
same
situation
that
arose
in
this
case
and
they
probably
are
cases
where
there
was
nighttime
authorization
in
a
warrant
and
now
the
supreme
court
says
“that’s
a
mistake.
879
(a)
requires
a
special
showing.”
can
it
seriously
be
contended
that
it
will
further
the
interest
of
justice?
that
you
will,
in
the
language
of
justice
brennan
in
calandra,
minimized
the
risk
of
seriously
undermining
popular
trust
in
government
if
you
would
allow
a
defendant
to
go
free
with
suppressing
the
evidence
against
the
defendant
which
was
obtained
in
good
faith
and
relies
on
decisions
of
responsible
courts
of
appeals?
the
miller
case,
which
my
colleague
has
cited
to
you,
which
of
course
is
a
no-knock
entry
case
falls
in
a
completely
different
category.
the
issue
there
was
not
the
validity
of
the
warrant,
but
of
the
manner
of
its
execution.
the
magistrate
did
not
authorize
the
police
in
miller
to
make
a
no-knock
entry.
what’s
more,
i
don’t
think
that
there
was
a
contention
of
good
faith
in
miller.
in
miller,
they
did
something
which
was
held
to
be
unlawful,
breaking
down
the
door
and
going
in.
it’s,
i
think,
a
clearly
distinguishable
situation
than
this.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
think
that’s
right.
in
any
event
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
right.
now,
another
important
point
that
i
want
to
make,
i
think
petitioner
has
misconceived
the
thrust
of
our
argument
in
--
on
the
exclusionary
rule
point
in
one
significant
respect.
if
a
court
now
announces
a
definitive
rule
of
interpretation
under
879
(a)
or
definitive
rule
applicable
to
the
district
of
columbia
police,
we
agree
that
warrants
thereafter
procured
in
violation
of
the
statute
as
construed
by
the
court
would
result
in
seizure
of
excludable
evidence.
at
that
point,
of
course,
we
could
not
make
a
defense
that
this
was
a
good
faith
presentation
of
an
application
to
a
magistrate
which
they
--
which
was
honestly
believed
to
provide
a
basis
for
authorization
of
nighttime
execution.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
true,
and
i
suppose
there
could
be
other
circumstances
in
which
we
would
advance
the
same
argument,
if
they
got
a
warrant.
after
all,
the
exclusionary
rule
is
not
required
to
control
the
conduct
of
magistrates.
magistrates
are
judicial
officers.
they’re
presumably
under
the
control
of
the
judicial
branch
and,
presumably,
there’s
someway
to
get
magistrates
to
obey
the
law
other
than
excluding
evidence
which
the
police
seized
pursuant
to
the
directions
of
the
magistrate.
now,
with
the
nighttime
search
argument,
i
raise
the
issue
and
we
raise
it
in
our
brief
because
it
has
some
importance
beyond
the
confines
of
this
immediate
case,
the
definition
of
what
is
nighttime.
the
court
has
resolved
that
question
with
respect
to
searches
under
rule
41.
however,
it
is
an
open
question
presumably
with
respect
to
searches
governed
by
the
district
of
columbia
code
where
there
is
no
definition
of
nighttime
or
daytime,
and
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it’s
also
presumably
an
open
question
under
the
us
code
provision,
section
879.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
right.
well,
we
are
not
asking
you
to
reach
out
to
the
nighttime
search
issue
if
you
resolve
the
879
(a)
issue
of
our
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
let
me
say
this.
if
you
hold
that
this
was
a
nighttime
search
under
879
(a),
i
think
we
would
not
wish
to
persist
in
our
argument
that
it
would
not
be
a
nighttime
search
under
title
xxiii.
so,
that
doesn’t
become
a
problem.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not
at
all.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not--
i
simply
suggest
that
we
will
withdraw
the
argument
with
respect
to
nighttime
search
under
the
d.c.
code
if
you
find
that
it
was
a
nighttime
search
under
the
federal
code.
if
you
find
that
it
was
not
a
nighttime
search
under
the
federal
code,
you
don’t
have
to
reach
it
under
the
d.c.
code.
however,
i
have
no
doubt
that
what
you
might
say
on
the
federal
code
issue
would
have
some
possible
effect
on
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
but
that’s
an
inevitable
result
of
the
role
of
this
court.
now,
i
think
one
final
point
with
respect
to
section
879
(a);
we’ve
indicated
in
our
brief
that
the
language
of
that
statute,
when
you
look
at
it
on
its
face
appears
to
support
the
petitioner’s
position.
in
asking
him
questions,
obviously
the
court
was
troubled
by
what
standard
was
for
the
showing
that
would
have
to
be
made,
if
some
showing
has
to
be
made.
now,
presumably
in
order
to
ascertain
the
standard
for
the
showing,
one
has
to
go
to
the
legislative
history
or
at
least
that’s
one
place
one
might
look.
and
when
one
looks
at
the
legislative
history,
one
finds
that
the
kind
of
showing
that
congress
intended
to
be
made
in
this
case
was
no
showing
at
all.
now,
that
creates
somewhat
of
a
conundrum
about
relying
on
what
petitioner
contends
as
the
plain
language
of
879
(a).
for
all
of
these
reasons,
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
