justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you,
in
effect,
reading
in
879
(a)
the
explicit
provision
of
522
(c)
1,
namely
the
application
must
demonstrate
that
(a)
it
cannot
be
executed
during
the
hours
of
daylight?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
additional
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
you
have
to
show
why
you
have
to
go
in
at
night,
doesn’t
that
imply
that
it
can’t
be
executed
during
the
hours
of
daylight?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
such
warrants
under
414
may
be
issued
either
by
the
superior
court
or
by
united
states
magistrate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
under
879,
they
may
be
obtained
either
from
a
district
court
judge
or
a
united
states
magistrate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
what
it
says
is
if
the
judge,
is
judge
mino
the
district
court
judge
in
879
(a)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
how
about
a
superior
court
judge
in
the
district?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
mr.
frey,
i
gather
that
your
position
at
least
is
that
521
and
523
are
inapplicable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
don’t
claim
that
414
is
applicable?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals,
apparently?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh,
i
see.
the
--
well,
the
court
of
appeals
held
it
inapplicable
not
necessarily
because
it
was
resolving
the
conflict,
as
i
read
this
opinion,
between
414
and
521,
if
it
is
a
conflict,
but
rather
because
414
(c)
arguably
imposes
an
additional
requirement
that
wasn’t
met
here.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and,
therefore,
they
go
on
to
say
that
this
requirement
--
we
will
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
414
would
not
validate
the
search
warrants
involved.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
tell
me,
mr.
frey,
even
if
all
this
is
right,
ordinarily,
we
don’t
review
interpretations
by
the
court
of
appeals,
either
of
the
district
or
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
of
the
meaning
of
district
code
provisions,
do
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know.
do
we
ordinarily,
do
we
ordinarily?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
we
don’t,
and
why
should
we
in
this
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
if
we’re
going
to
get
into
the
business
of
second
guessing,
particularly
under
the
new
judicial
instruction,
the
interpretation
of
d.c.
code
provisions
by
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
court
of
appeals,
we’re
going
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
then
we’re
going
to
have
a
lot
more
work
than
we
have
now
to
do.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
when
you
disagree
with
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
there
you
are.
that’s
not
--
that’s
determination,
at
least
the
decision
which
indicates
a
construction
by
the
d.c.
court
of
appeals,
not
by
the
united
states
court
of
appeals,
that
414
doesn’t
apply.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
weeks,
mr.
frey?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
was?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
there
a
warrant?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
looked
at
weeks,
mr.
frey,
and
you’re
correct.
there
was
no
warrant.
it
was
taken
by
an
official
of
the
united
states
without
a
warrant
and
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
again,
shouldn’t
we
wait
on
courts
of
the
district
of
columbia
to
tell
us
what
they
think
their
code
means?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
if
879
(a)
is
interpreted
as
petitioner
asks
us
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
want
us
to
interpret
521,
for
example,
which
certainly
explicitly
refers
to
nighttime.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
do
want
us
to
interpret
the
d.c.
code,
don't
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
the
judges
there
get
a
chance
to
interpret
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
have
no
doubt
either.
