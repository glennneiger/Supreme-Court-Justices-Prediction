mr.
william
h.
drew
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
arkansas
will
agree
with
the
state
of
mississippi
on
the
law.
apparently,
there
is
no
contest
of
the
law
involved.
it
will
be
merely
a
fact
--
factual
situation
that
if
luna
bar
or
luna
island
is
the
product
of
an
accretion
then
of
course
the
evidence
is
that
the
river
and
the
thalweg
was
west
of
it.
if
it
however
did
not
imperceptibly
move,
then
the
theory
of
the
state
of
mississippi
and
it
being
in
the
state
mississippi
would
be
incorrect.
to
go
a
little
further,
the
state
of
arkansas
conceded
that
in
its
inception
that
the
state
of
mississippi
raised
a
prima
facie
presumption
that
the
river
did
migrate,
it
did
not
concede
that
the
river
did
in
fact
migrate
across.
by
the
testimony
of
mr.
kolb
--
dr.
kolb
and
the
witnesses
for
the
state
of
mississippi,
we
conceded
that
they
raised
the
prima
facie
presumption
that
under
normal
circumstances
and
accepted
principles
there
is
a
westward
migration
of
the
river
and
had
been
way
of
this
type,
however,
in
the
accepted
situation,
we
do
not
necessarily
agree
it
occurred
at
that
time,
in
fact
we
think
the
evidence
is
quite
contrary.
we
agree
that
there
are
many
recorded
maps
and
one
particular
map
of
--
was
--
the
defendant’s
exhibit
number
8
which
was
a
map
of
the
--
i
meant,
ownership
map
of
washington
county,
mississippi
in
1871.
this
map
does
not
bear
out
the
contention
of
the
state
of
mississippi
in
any
way.
appendix
--
the
map
of
1863,
lloyd’s
map,
and
i
believe
it’s
the
9th
exhibit
in
judge
o’sullivan’s
report.
there
is
an
accretion
to
the
northern
side
of
carter
point
but
this
is
not
the
location
of
luna
bar
or
luna
island,
it
is
to
the
north
and
completely
distant
by
two
to
three
miles.
the
--
had
the
rift
in
1971
all
of
the
maps
and
we
commenced
with
the
government
land
office
survey
of
1823
on
the
arkansas
bank,
1830
on
the
mississippi
bank.
from
those
points
on
there
is
no
divided
channel
in
spanish
moss
bend.
this
goes
through
the
humphreys
and
map
1861
which
was
the
general
reconnaissance
map
used
by
general
grant
in
the
conquest
of
vicksburg.
there
is
no
divided
channel
all
the
way
through
in
1871
based
upon
the
maps
from
the
library
of
congress
and
the
senate
and
the
other
maps
and
also
the
defendant’s
exhibit
number
8
of
washington
county.
in
1872,
there
is
a
divided
channel
apparently
based
upon
the
maps
of
mr.
e.
a.
douglas
who
was
apparently
commissioned
to
show
the
breaches
in
the
levee
and
to
get
congressional
assistance
in
this
area.
immediately,
west
of
luna
bar,
there
is
about
a
mile
or
so
of
levee
that
are
breached,
the
report
of
mr.
--
of
general
humphreys
is
that
this
levee
was
breached
there
but
the
waters
were
not
going
to
the
tinsel
bottoms
but
were
passing
back
to
the
main
channel
of
the
river.
mr.
smith,
in
behalf
of
the
state
of
mississippi,
deduced
that
the
caving
in
the
bank
above
columbia
was
in
spanish
moss
bend.
the
history
of
pre-columbia
was
the
first
county
seat
of
chicot
county.
it
did
in
fact
washed
into
the
river
and
caved
away
and
the
county
seat
was
subsequently
was
afterward
removed.
columbia
no
longer
exists
even
in
any
way
because
it
all
went
into
the
river
and
its
some
several
miles
south
of
there.
be
that
as
it
may,
in
1872,
the
map
of
mr.
douglas,
if
we
will
take
the
--
and
assume
that
the
projectile
like,
the
little
marking
over
there
is
the
mississippi
bank
or
is
luna
bar
would
be
its
first
appearance.
however
in
1873,
there
isn’t
any
question
as
to
the
appearance
of
luna
bar
or
luna
island.
major
sutter
(ph),
commissioned
by
congress
made
a
quick
reconnaissance
of
the
river.
he
was
making
this
reconnaissance
due
to
the
vast
flood
damage
and
to
make
a
report
to
congress
for
assistance
therein.
major
sutter
in
his
map
of
reconnaissance
which
would
be
defendant’s
exhibit
number
12
clearly
set
forth
a
bar
in
the
river,
he
clearly
wrote
legend,
spanish
moss
bend
in
the
eastward
channel
and
shows
the
thalweg
of
the
river
in
the
western
channel.
and
going
through
his
entire
report
he
meticulously
has
put
the
legend
of
the
name
of
the
bend
even
when
crowded
for
space
where
it
apparently
originally
was.

mr.

mr.
william

yes,
sir.
so
we
know
that
the
island
came
into
existence
in
1872.
the
first
hydrographic
survey
of
the
river
took
place
in
1879-82,
the
actual
geological
survey
--
of
the
surveying
and
it
all
took
place
in
‘71.
the
map
and
it’s
--
whatever
they’ll
show
in
their
own
continued
on
through
‘82.
and
at
that
point,
it
shows
a
divided
channel.
the
court’s
attention
is
called
to
the
testimony
of
dr.
kolb
and
mr.
smith
and
particularly
so,
sir
with
reference
to
the
elevations
of
the
island,
mr.
gar
(ph)
had
made
a
survey
line
across
the
island
which
crosses
the
north
side
and
is
clearly
in
an
accretion
area,
reference
line
a
to
b,
c
and
i
believe
it
goes
to
d
on
up
to
carter
point.
all
of
the
elevations
alluded
to
by
dr.
kolb
and
mr.
smith
were
based
upon
the
elevations
of
that
reference
line
and
not
to
the
highest
recorded
elevations
of
the
island
itself.
if
the
court
please,
the
court
to
locate
exhibit
number
--
i
believe
its
appendix
a
to
the
master’s
report
will
note
that
the
original
survey
lines
of
1823
on
the
arkansas
bank,
1830,
the
mississippi
bank
are
shown
therein
with
heavy
pencil.
at
the
distal
south,
distal
end
is
the
island
itself,
the
accretions
being
the
portion
to
the
north.
the
reference
line
crossed
over
on
to
the
northern
portion
of
the
island
and
not
through
the
higher
area.
based
upon
the
physical
maps
and
what
the
--
it
thoroughly
show,
there
was
no
accretion
to
the
distal
end
of
carter
point,
exhibit
d-a
--
8,
ownership
of
washington
county
completely
shows
carter
point
in
its
original
position.
the
other
exhibits
that
are
made
about
that
time
also
can
reach
that
same
conclusion
and
therefore
we
know
that
the
island
did
come
into
existence
in
the
year
1872
based
upon
mr.
douglas’
map
followed
by
major
sutter’s.
the
--
thereafter
there
is
a
divided
channel
at
old
time
but
every
mississippi
river
commissions
survey
from
1880,
the
first
all
the
way
through
to
the
present
time,
there
is
a
divided
channel
around
the
island.
the
state
of
arkansas
employed
dr.

excuse
me
--
mr.
william

yes,
sir.
mr.
william

mr.
justice
stewart,
the

eastward
of
that
point
approximately
five
miles,
there
was
a
channel,
a

through
carter

but
navigation

however,
the
river
is
still
active
in
carter
point
and
i
mean,
in
spanish
moss
bend
and
has
always
been
i
think
the
testimony
will
be
that
only
a
very
small
portion
of
the
island
was
that
at
one
turn
during
the
suit
and
other
times
it

the

mr.

mr.

concedes
that
the

mr.
william

and
the
levee
had
been
cut-off.
however
it
does
not
concede
that
the
river
is
inactive
in
that
area
at
all.
so
it
is
very
active.
mr.
william

the

mr.

dr.
durham
and
mr.
spillers
made
an
extensive
geological
investigation
of
the
island
itself.
the
strata
of
the
soil,
the
leveling
--
its
level
across
the
same
strata
run
uniformly
throughout
its
length
that
is
inconsistent
with
a

an
accretion
such
would
have
bending
waves
or
layers
of
soil
therein
as
it
accreted
and
moved
outward.
both
dr.

and
mr.

also
made
investigation
as
to
the
pre-existing
channels
that
lie
westward
even
of
luna
island
itself.
the
present
channel
of
the
western
channel,
they
made
an
extensive
study
therein
and
found
the
low
lying
cypress
stumps
that
grew
in
place
that
are
lying
in
the
bottom
of
that
bed
and
also
are
lying
east
of
the
western
migration
of
the
river
itself.
the
evidence,
the
physical
evidence
there
concludes
that
there
is
or
was
a
low-lying
area
in
there.
however,
had
the
river
migrated
westward
as
contended
by
the
state
of
mississippi,
these
cypress
stumps
that
are
lying
east
of
this
westward
migration
that
by
ring
count
or
over
250
years
old
would
have
been
erased?
the
state
of
mississippi
says,
“well,
they
could
have
floated
in
and
landed
there.”
with
the
given
description
of
with
all
just
floating
the
roots
are
up
when
you
saw
them
off,
they
flop
up,
they
don’t
sink
downward.
however,
there
was
a
testimony
by
experienced
foresters;
these
trees
were
trees
that
grew
in
place
their
needs,
their
root
systems
and
all
are
there.
this
is
in
the
western
channel
and
not
on
the
island
itself.
on
the
island
itself,
in
the
higher
elevation
which
will
be
in
that
south
central
part
on
exhibit,
appendix
a,
the
high
elevation
that
is
recorded
much
higher
than
is
shown
by
the
state
of
mississippi,
there
are
tree
stumps
of
antiquity
there
or
ancient
that
were
located
by
mr.
putnam,
who
is
now
deceased
and
mr.
campson

both
experienced
foresters,
both
testified
these
stumps
are
from
the
trees
that
grew
in
that
spot,
they
examined
them.
the
carbon
dating
of
that
stump,
by
dr.
iddings
(ph)
which
was
the
tree
had
been
dead
--
at
the
time
of
its
death
was
550
years
plus
or
minus
180.
as
i
understand
the
carbon
dating,
the
longer
the
half-life
is
computed
the
smaller
the
figure.
the
time
element
involved
and
having
established
a
tree
of
antiquity
much
greater
than
the
hundred-year
period
that
would
be
involved
herein.
it
was
not
run
any
longer.
this
particular
tree
was
the
red
mulberry
stump,
sir
that
was
84
years
old
by
ring
count
at
the
time
of
its
death.
even
without
the
carbon
dating,
we
know
that
from
the
surveys
thereafter
the
1882
survey
the
--
the
tree
mass
was
there
gone
and
this
tree
if
growing
there
had
been
dead
at
least
by
that
time
which
was
prior
to
the
clever
man’s
survey.
the
other
two
of
those
trees:
one,
a
red
mulberry
and
the
other
a
black
walnut.
the
black
walnut
was
flagged
and
left
in
place
by
mr.
thompson.
the
ring
count
they
are
on
was
112
years
old.
there
was
no
attempt
to
carbon
date
yet.
it
also
had
been
dead
longer
than
the
period
of
time
involved
and
was
of
age
there.
the
other
was
the
red
mulberry
with
112
years
old
or
some
back
at
the,
exactly,
i
do
not
recall.
had
the
river
moved
imperceptibly
westward
as
contended
by
the
presumption
raised
by
the
state
of
mississippi,
these
stumps
could
not
have
existed.
further,
we
have
the
testimony
of
mr.
richard
proctor,
who
is
an
elderly
man
that
i
have
known
all
of
my
life
since
i
was
born
and
raised
between
two
miles
of
this
part.
mr.
proctor
testified
and
if
you’ll
notice
his
testimony
in
came
it
as
not
solicited
but
a
voluntary
thing,
that
on
this
island,
he
was
asked
a
question
and
he
remembered
going
upon
the
island
and
going
into
a
cistern
and
taking
a
mink.
we
further
have
the
testimony
of
dr.

i’m
sorry
his
name
escapes
me.
the
gentleman
with
his
jury
topics
who

defendant’s
exhibit
number
39
which
is
a
county
map
of
chicot
county
prepared
by
mr.
w.
a.
miller
(ph),
who
at
that
time
was
the
county
surveyor
who
shows
clearly
the
luna
island
bar
area
as
being
it
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
it’s
the
contention
of
the
state
of
arkansas
that
the
report
by
honorable
judge
--
mr.
judge
o’sullivan
is
erroneous
in
that
it
adopts
the
depth
or
the
elevation
theory
of
the
state
of
mississippi
on
a
reference
line
was
aren’t
regard
to
the
true
elevation
of
the
island
from
where
the
physical
facts
of
antiquity
were
discovered.
secondly,
the
map
area
does
not
support
the
contentions
in
anyway
and
in
fact
negates
it.
we
believe
that
the
state
of
arkansas
has
completely
negated
the
presumption
raised
by
dr.
kolb
or
by
mr.
smith
with
physical
factual
evidence
that
makes
the
fact
that
this
would
be
a
part
of
mississippi
in
impossibility.
we
thank
you
very
much
sir.
mr.
william
h.
drew
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
arkansas
will
agree
with
the
state
of
mississippi
on
the
law.
apparently,
there
is
no
contest
of
the
law
involved.
it
will
be
merely
a
fact
--
factual
situation
that
if
luna
bar
or
luna
island
is
the
product
of
an
accretion
then
of
course
the
evidence
is
that
the
river
and
the
thalweg
was
west
of
it.
if
it
however
did
not
imperceptibly
move,
then
the
theory
of
the
state
of
mississippi
and
it
being
in
the
state
mississippi
would
be
incorrect.
to
go
a
little
further,
the
state
of
arkansas
conceded
that
in
its
inception
that
the
state
of
mississippi
raised
a
prima
facie
presumption
that
the
river
did
migrate,
it
did
not
concede
that
the
river
did
in
fact
migrate
across.
by
the
testimony
of
mr.
kolb
--
dr.
kolb
and
the
witnesses
for
the
state
of
mississippi,
we
conceded
that
they
raised
the
prima
facie
presumption
that
under
normal
circumstances
and
accepted
principles
there
is
a
westward
migration
of
the
river
and
had
been
way
of
this
type,
however,
in
the
accepted
situation,
we
do
not
necessarily
agree
it
occurred
at
that
time,
in
fact
we
think
the
evidence
is
quite
contrary.
we
agree
that
there
are
many
recorded
maps
and
one
particular
map
of
--
was
--
the
defendant’s
exhibit
number
8
which
was
a
map
of
the
--
i
meant,
ownership
map
of
washington
county,
mississippi
in
1871.
this
map
does
not
bear
out
the
contention
of
the
state
of
mississippi
in
any
way.
appendix

the
map
of
1863,
lloyd’s
map,
and
i
believe
it’s
the
9th
exhibit
in
judge
o’sullivan’s
report.
there
is
an
accretion
to
the
northern
side
of
carter
point
but
this
is
not
the
location
of
luna
bar
or
luna
island,
it
is
to
the
north
and
completely
distant
by
two
to
three
miles.
the

in
1971
all
of
the
maps
and
we
commenced
with
the
government
land
office
survey
of
1823
on
the
arkansas
bank,
1830
on
the
mississippi
bank.
from
those
points
on
there
is
no
divided
channel
in
spanish
moss
bend.
this
goes
through
the
humphreys
and
map
1861
which
was
the
general
reconnaissance
map
used
by
general
grant
in
the
conquest
of
vicksburg.
there
is
no
divided
channel
all
the
way
through
in
1871
based
upon
the
maps
from
the
library
of
congress
and
the
senate
and
the
other
maps
and
also
the
defendant’s
exhibit
number
8
of
washington
county.
in
1872,
there
is
a
divided
channel
apparently
based
upon
the
maps
of
mr.
e.
a.
douglas
who
was
apparently
commissioned
to
show
the
breaches
in
the
levee
and
to
get
congressional
assistance
in
this
area.
immediately,
west
of
luna
bar,
there
is
about
a
mile
or
so
of
levee
that
are
breached,
the
report
of
mr.
--
of
general
humphreys
is
that
this
levee
was
breached
there
but
the
waters
were
not
going
to
the
tinsel
bottoms
but
were
passing
back
to
the
main
channel
of
the
river.
mr.
smith,
in
behalf
of
the
state
of
mississippi,
deduced
that
the
caving
in
the
bank
above
columbia
was
in
spanish
moss
bend.
the
history
of
pre-columbia
was
the
first
county
seat
of
chicot
county.
it
did
in
fact
washed
into
the
river
and
caved
away
and
the
county
seat
was
subsequently
was
afterward
removed.
columbia
no
longer
exists
even
in
any
way
because
it
all
went
into
the
river
and
its
some
several
miles
south
of
there.
be
that
as
it
may,
in
1872,
the
map
of
mr.
douglas,
if
we
will
take
the
--
and
assume
that
the
projectile
like,
the
little
marking
over
there
is
the
mississippi
bank
or
is
luna
bar
would
be
its
first
appearance.
however
in
1873,
there
isn’t
any
question
as
to
the
appearance
of
luna
bar
or
luna
island.
major
sutter
(ph),
commissioned
by
congress
made
a
quick
reconnaissance
of
the
river.
he
was
making
this
reconnaissance
due
to
the
vast
flood
damage
and
to
make
a
report
to
congress
for
assistance
therein.
major
sutter
in
his
map
of
reconnaissance
which
would
be
defendant’s
exhibit
number
12
clearly
set
forth
a
bar
in
the
river,
he
clearly
wrote
legend,
spanish
moss
bend
in
the
eastward
channel
and
shows
the
thalweg
of
the
river
in
the
western
channel.
and
going
through
his
entire
report
he
meticulously
has
put
the
legend
of
the
name
of
the
bend
even
when
crowded
for
space
where
it
apparently
originally
was.

mr.

mr.
william

so
we
know
that
the
island
came
into
existence
in
1872.
the
first
hydrographic
survey
of
the
river
took
place
in
1879-82,
the
actual
geological
survey
--
of
the
surveying
and
it
all
took
place
in
‘71.
the
map
and
it’s
--
whatever
they’ll
show
in
their
own
continued
on
through
‘82.
and
at
that
point,
it
shows
a
divided
channel.
the
court’s
attention
is
called
to
the
testimony
of
dr.
kolb
and
mr.
smith
and
particularly
so,
sir
with
reference
to
the
elevations
of
the
island,
mr.
gar
(ph)
had
made
a
survey
line
across
the
island
which
crosses
the
north
side
and
is
clearly
in
an
accretion
area,
reference
line
a
to
b,
c
and
i
believe
it
goes
to
d
on
up
to
carter
point.
all
of
the
elevations
alluded
to
by
dr.
kolb
and
mr.
smith
were
based
upon
the
elevations
of
that
reference
line
and
not
to
the
highest
recorded
elevations
of
the
island
itself.
if
the
court
please,
the
court
to
locate
exhibit
number
--
i
believe
its
appendix
a
to
the
master’s
report
will
note
that
the
original
survey
lines
of
1823
on
the
arkansas
bank,
1830,
the
mississippi
bank
are
shown
therein
with
heavy
pencil.
at
the
distal
south,
distal
end
is
the
island
itself,
the
accretions
being
the
portion
to
the
north.
the
reference
line
crossed
over
on
to
the
northern
portion
of
the
island
and
not
through
the
higher
area.
based
upon
the
physical
maps
and
what
the
--
it
thoroughly
show,
there
was
no
accretion
to
the
distal
end
of
carter
point,
exhibit
d-a
--
8,
ownership
of
washington
county
completely
shows
carter
point
in
its
original
position.
the
other
exhibits
that
are
made
about
that
time
also
can
reach
that
same
conclusion
and
therefore
we
know
that
the
island
did
come
into
existence
in
the
year
1872
based
upon
mr.
douglas’
map
followed
by
major
sutter’s.
the
--
thereafter
there
is
a
divided
channel
at
old
time
but
every
mississippi
river
commissions
survey
from
1880,
the
first
all
the
way
through
to
the
present
time,
there
is
a
divided
channel
around
the
island.
the
state
of
arkansas
employed
dr.
kolb,
excuse
me
--
mr.
william

yes,
sir.
mr.
william

mr.
justice
stewart,
the

eastward
of
that
point
approximately
five
miles,
there
was
a
channel,
a

through
carter

but
navigation

however,
the
river
is
still
active
in
carter
point
and
i
mean,
in
spanish
moss
bend
and
has
always
been
i
think
the
testimony
will
be
that
only
a
very
small
portion
of
the
island
was
that
at
one
turn
during
the
suit
and
other
times
it

the

mr.

mr.

and
the
levee
had
been
cut-off.
however
it
does
not
concede
that
the
river
is
inactive
in
that
area
at
all.
so
it
is
very
active.
mr.

the

mr.

dr.
durham
and
mr.
spillers
made
an
extensive
geological
investigation
of
the
island
itself.
the
strata
of
the
soil,
the
leveling
--
its
level
across
the
same
strata
run
uniformly
throughout
its
length
that
is
inconsistent
with
a

an
accretion
such
would
have
bending
waves
or
layers
of
soil
therein
as
it
accreted
and
moved
outward.
both
dr.

and
mr.

made
investigation
as
to
the
pre-existing
channels
that
lie
westward
even
of
luna
island
itself.
the
present
channel
of
the
western
channel,
they
made
an
extensive
study
therein
and
found
the
low
lying
cypress
stumps
that
grew
in
place
that
are
lying
in
the
bottom
of
that
bed
and
also
are
lying
east
of
the
western
migration
of
the
river
itself.
the
evidence,
the
physical
evidence
there
concludes
that
there
is
or
was
a
low-lying
area
in
there.
however,
had
the
river
migrated
westward
as
contended
by
the
state
of
mississippi,
these
cypress
stumps
that
are
lying
east
of
this
westward
migration
that
by
ring
count
or
over
250
years
old
would
have
been
erased?
the
state
of
mississippi
says,
“well,
they
could
have
floated
in
and
landed
there.”
with
the
given
description
of
with
all
just
floating
the
roots
are
up
when
you
saw
them
off,
they
flop
up,
they
don’t
sink
downward.
however,
there
was
a
testimony
by
experienced
foresters;
these
trees
were
trees
that
grew
in
place
their
needs,
their
root
systems
and
all
are
there.
this
is
in
the
western
channel
and
not
on
the
island
itself.
on
the
island
itself,
in
the
higher
elevation
which
will
be
in
that
south
central
part
on
exhibit,
appendix
a,
the
high
elevation
that
is
recorded
much
higher
than
is
shown
by
the
state
of
mississippi,
there
are
tree
stumps
of
antiquity
there
or
ancient
that
were
located
by
mr.
putnam,
who
is
now
deceased
and
mr.
campson

both
experienced
foresters,
both
testified
these
stumps
are
from
the
trees
that

in
that
spot,
they
examined
them.
the
carbon
dating
of
that
stump,
by
dr.
iddings
(ph)
which
was
the
tree
had
been
dead
--
at
the
time
of
its
death
was
550
years
plus
or
minus
180.
as
i
understand
the
carbon
dating,
the
longer
the
half-life
is
computed
the
smaller
the
figure.
the
time
element
involved
and
having
established
a
tree
of
antiquity
much
greater
than
the
hundred-year
period
that
would
be
involved
herein.
it
was
not
run
any
longer.
this
particular
tree
was
the
red
mulberry
stump,
sir
that
was
84
years
old
by
ring
count
at
the
time
of
its
death.
even
without
the
carbon
dating,
we
know
that
from
the
surveys
thereafter
the
1882
survey
the
--
the
tree
mass
was
there
gone
and
this
tree
if
growing
there
had
been
dead
at
least
by
that
time
which
was
prior
to
the
clever
man’s
survey.
the
other
two
of
those
trees:
one,
a
red
mulberry
and
the
other
a
black
walnut.
the
black
walnut
was
flagged
and
left
in
place
by
mr.
thompson.
the
ring
count
they
are
on
was
112
years
old.
there
was
no
attempt
to
carbon
date
yet.
it
also
had
been
dead
longer
than
the
period
of
time
involved
and
was
of
age
there.
the
other
was
the
red
mulberry
with
112
years
old
or
some
back
at
the,
exactly,
i
do
not
recall.
had
the
river
moved
imperceptibly
westward
as
contended
by
the
presumption
raised
by
the
state
of
mississippi,
these
stumps
could
not
have
existed.
further,
we
have
the
testimony
of
mr.
richard
proctor,
who
is
an
elderly
man
that
i
have
known
all
of
my
life
since
i
was
born
and
raised
between
two
miles
of
this
part.
mr.
proctor
testified
and
if
you’ll
notice
his
testimony
in
came
it
as
not
solicited
but
a
voluntary
thing,
that
on
this
island,
he
was
asked
a
question
and
he
remembered
going
upon
the
island
and
going
into
a
cistern
and
taking
a
mink.
we
further
have
the
testimony
of
dr.

i’m
sorry
his
name

me.
the
gentleman
with
his

in
the
geological
investigation
of
a
mississippi
river
alluvial
valley
and
its
ancient
courses
from
cape
girardeau,
missouri
to
downing,
missouri,
which
was
defendant’s
exhibit
number
30,
completely
supports
the
contention
of
the
state
of
arkansas,
completely
supports
dr.
durham
and
mr.
spillers.
it
completely
negates
the
presumption
of
the
state
of
mississippi.
in
its
geological
investigation,
dr.
fisk
shows
the
area
of
the
island
we
were
just
discussing
with
the
secondary
and
the
primary
trees
they’re
on
as
ancient
course
number
10.
in
the
hierarchy
of
the
years
on
the
ancient
courses,
they
fixed
them
by
centuries,
tenth
century,
eleventh,
and
twelfth
up
to
the
present
time,
however,
they
go
back
to
antiquity.
dr.
fisk
also
shows
that
the
higher
elevation
from
which
the
red
mulberry,
the
walnut
and
all
this
others
were
taken
as
well
as
the
tight
forestation
as
to
be
in
channel
number
10
or
in
existence
more
than
several
hundred
of
years.
we
have
the
defendant’s
exhibit
number
39
which
is
a
county
map
of
chicot
county
prepared
by
mr.
w.
a.
miller
(ph),
who
at
that
time
was
the
county
surveyor
who
shows
clearly
the
luna
island
bar
area
as
being
it
in
the
state
of
mississippi.
it’s
the
contention
of
the
state
of
arkansas
that
the
report
by
honorable
judge
--
mr.
judge
o’sullivan
is
erroneous
in
that
it
adopts
the
depth
or
the
elevation
theory
of
the
state
of
mississippi
on
a
reference
line
was
aren’t
regard
to
the
true
elevation
of
the
island
from
where
the
physical
facts
of
antiquity
were
discovered.
secondly,
the
map
area
does
not
support
the
contentions
in
anyway
and
in
fact
negates
it.
we
believe
that
the
state
of
arkansas
has
completely
negated
the
presumption
raised
by
dr.
kolb
or
by
mr.
smith
with
physical
factual
evidence
that
makes
the
fact
that
this
would
be
a
part
of
mississippi
in
impossibility.
we
thank
you
very
much
sir.
