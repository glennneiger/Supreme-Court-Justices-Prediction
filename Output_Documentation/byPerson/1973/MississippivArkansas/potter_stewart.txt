mr.

am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
there
really
isn’t
any
argument
on
the
law
at
all
between
the
two
states.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
just
the
application
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
ward,
in
respect
to
that
last
statement,
does
your
opposition
agree
with
you
on
that.
wasn’t
there
some
testimony
somewhere
that
there
is
evidence
of
an
old

on

of

river
or
the
trees
wouldn’t
have
grown
there.
you
assert
--
assume
with
me
if
you
will,
contrary
to
what
you
strenuously
represented
to
be
the
facts
that
the
trees
in
fact
did
grow
in
those
spots
for
84
years,
a
hundred
years,
whatever
it
was
year
old
trees
and
had
they
grown
there,
then
your
theory
as
to
the
historic

would
be
mistaken
wouldn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
right.
justice
potter
stewart

your
answer
yes
that
if
the
trees
had
grown
there,
your

would
be
mistake?
and

the
maps
would
be
mistaken
and

evidence
upon
which
you
relied?
