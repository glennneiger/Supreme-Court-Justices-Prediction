justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
original
action
by
the
state
of
mississippi
against
the
state
of
arkansas
is
one
to
fix
and
determine
the
boundary
line
between
the
two
states
in
the
old
bed
of
the
mississippi
river
between
the
ends
of
what
is
now
known
as
the
tarpley
cut-off
in
the
area
where
arkansas'
chicot
county
and
mississippi's
washington
county
adjoin.
we
granted
mississippi's
motion
to
file
a
bill
of
complaint
and
referred
the
matter
to
a
special
master.
he
held
hearings
and
has
issued
and
filed
his
report.
his
findings
favored
mississippi
and
his
recommended
decree
is
line
with
those
findings.
arkansas
filed
exceptions
and
the
case
had
been
briefed
and
argued
orally
here.
what
it
comes
down
to
is
the
rather
common
situation
as
to
whether
a
certain
area
known
as
luna
bar
came
into
being
by
gradual
migration
of
the
mississippi
river
westward
or
instead
by
some
of
avulsive
process
to
the
west.
as
this
factual
issue
is
resolved,
mississippi
or
arkansas
will
prevail.
that
is
if
luna
bar
was
formed
by
a
accretion
mississippi
wins
and
contrarily
if
luna
bar
had
resulted
from
an
avulsion,
arkansas
prevails.
we
have
made
an
independent
review
of
the
record
and
find
ourselves
in
agreement
with
the
findings
of
fact
purposed
by
the
special
master
and
we
therefore
affirm
those
findings,
overrule
arkansas
exceptions,
confirm
the
master's
report
and
in
general
except
his
recommendations
for
a
decree.
in
a
opinion
filed
today,
we
discuss
three
particular
aspects
of
the
evidence
namely
these
some
ancient
tree
stumps,
some
testimony
has
to
the
nature
of
the
soil
on
luna
bar
and
testimony
as
to
elevations.
the
majority
of
the
court
credit
the
witnesses
for
mississippi
and
conclude
that
their
testimony
greatly
buttresses
the
prima
facie
case,
which
arkansas
and
mississippi
had
made
out.
the
entry
of
a
decree
is
directed
accordingly.
i
am
authorized
to
say
that
mr.
justice
douglas
is
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
with
the
court.
