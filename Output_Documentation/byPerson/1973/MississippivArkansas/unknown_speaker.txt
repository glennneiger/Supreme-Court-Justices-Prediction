mr.
ward,
i
take
it
the
only
argument
here
is
over
luna
bar,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
is
this
a
very
valuable
piece?
unknown
speaker
appellant
exercised
here
on
a
--
unknown
speaker
or
an
old
cistern
was
--
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
habitation
there
now?
unknown
speaker
is
there
habitation
there
now?
unknown
speaker
but
you’re
still
arresting
people
on
luna
bar
for
something?
unknown
speaker
what
--
for
what
--
on
what
kind
of
charges?
unknown
speaker
the
litigation.
unknown
speaker
well,
these
are
hunters?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ward,
there
was
a
testimony
by
a
forester
with
respect
to
the
existence
of
three
rather
mature
trees,
one,
a
red
mulberry
tree,
i
think
and
the
other,
a
black
walnut
tree
and
as
i
remember
the
species
of
the
third
tree
was
not
identified
which
arkansas
says
tends
to
support
their
theory.
where
were
those,
it
wasn’t
clear
to
me,
where
those
trees
--
where
the
forester
testified
he
found
those
trees
or
tree
stumps
and
what
the
--
unknown
speaker
--
significance
of
them
would
be?
unknown
speaker
and
they
testified,
they
were
deeply
rooted
there,
they
were
--
didn’t
they?
unknown
speaker
if
in
fact,
trees
of
that
age
had
grown
in
that
spot
then
your
theory
would
be
erroneous,
wouldn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
i
see
it,
but
--
unknown
speaker
well,
yes.
but
my
question
was
if
those
trees
had
in
fact
grown
where
they
were
found
of
that
age
then
all
of
your
evidence
is
wrong,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
drew
when
you
refer
to
this
various
defendant’s
exhibits,
those
are
arkansas
exhibits
and
they're
not
attached
to
the
master’s
reports?
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
here
in
the
file,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
alright.
