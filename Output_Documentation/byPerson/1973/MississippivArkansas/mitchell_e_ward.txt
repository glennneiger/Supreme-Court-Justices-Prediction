mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
mississippi
has
filed
this
original
action
asking
the
court
to
make
a
judicial
determination
of
a
disputed
boundary
line
between
the
two
states.
the
uncertainty
of
the
boundary
line
is
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
located
in
an
abandoned
bend
of
the
mississippi
river
but
formerly
was
a
boundary
but
which
is
now
been
cut-off
by
the
action
of
the
u.s.
engineers
in
making
a
neck
cut-off
in
1935.
when
the
two
states
were
admitted
to
the
union,
the
acts
admitting
the
union
made
the
mississippi
river
the
common
boundary.
in
the
area
in
question,
the
river
loop
westward
and
southward
and
then
eastward
around
a
long
neck
of
land
which
was
located
in
mississippi
known
as
carter
point,
mississippi
and
this
map
have
depicted
in
the
arkansas-mississippi
refuge
quadrangle
was
attached
to
the
special
master’s
report,
the
honorable
clifford
o'sullivan.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
that’s
the
map
like
this.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
that’s
right,
appendix
a,
yes.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
the
black
line
on
this
map
shows
the
location
of
the
river
when
it
was
surveyed
by
the
surveyor
general
of
the
united
states.
it
is
the
contention
of
mississippi
that
from
about
1823
to
1830,
the
time
of
the
original
g.l.o.
surveys
that
the
river
migrated
slowly
and
imperceptibly
caving
in
to
the
arkansas
bank
and
adding
accretions
to
carter
point,
mississippi
until
such
time
as
it
moved
approximately
2,000
feet
to
the
west,
in
the
location
in
1935.
in
the
year
1935,
the
united
states
engineers
made
a
cut-off
across
the
neck
of
carter
point
which
is
shown
on
this
exhibit,
appendix
a,
thus,
diverting
the
flow
of
the
river
from
its
old
channel
around
the
carter
point
and
creating
a
new
channel
within
a
matter
of
some
three
months,
all
navigation
left
the
over
--
old
channel
and
adopted
the
new
channel
through
tarpley
point.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
yes,
that
area
around
luna
bar.
luna
bar
actually
created
the
problem.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
yes,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
its
--
by
now
it
has
probably
close
to
thousand
acres
of
land.
all
of
this
land
shown
in
spanish
moss
bend
has
filled
in.
there
have
been
numerous
problems
in
the
enforcement
of
criminal
law.
the
state
of
mississippi
arresting
residents
of
the
state
of
arkansas
on
this
bar
where
the
intended
confusion
about
which
state
has
criminal
jurisdiction.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
state
of
arkansas
that
this
gradual
migration
did
not
occur
but
that
in
the
year
1872,
the
river,
mississippi
river
suddenly
jumped,
caved
into
the
arkansas
bank,
went
over
bank,
scout
out
a
completely
new
channel
behind
the
mainland
of
arkansas
bank
and
then
re-entered
the
mississippi
channel
at
a
lower
area
there
thus,
creating
a
island
which
they
is
luna
island
and
not
luna
bar.
the
special
chancellor,
i
mean
the
special
master
resolved
this
conflict
in
favor
of
mississippi
and
we
are
here
today
on
exceptions
to
his
report.
we’re
not
sure
just
what
the
position
of
the
supreme
court
is
at
this
time
about
the
weight
to
be
given
or
the
finality
to
be
given
to
the
finding
of
a
special
master.
we
do
note
that
in
rule
9
(2)
of
the
supreme
court
rules
at
--
they
say
that
where
applicable,
the
federal
civil
rules
will
be
given
effect
and
in
rule
53
of
the
civil
rules,
it
is
provided
that
the
finding
--
factual
findings
of
a
master
will
not
be
disturbed
unless
clearly
erroneous.
actually,
we
are
in
agreement
with
mississippi
and
arkansas
in
agreement
with
the
basic
law
which
is
the
law
of
the
thalweg
and
we’re
really
here
arguing
a
point
of
fact
as
to
whether
the
finding
of
the
--
the
report
of
the
master
should
be
approved
on
that
finding.
we
both
agree
that
the
law
is
that
if
the
river
migrates
slowly
and
imperceptibly
and
the
thalweg
continues
to
cave
in
to
a
bank,
that
that
--
where
that
thalweg
is
the
boundary
line
between
states
that
that
changes
--
does
not
change
the
state
boundary
but
the
boundary
follows
the
deepest
line
of
navigation
of
sailing
line
or
thalweg
used
interchangeably
and
it
remains
the
state
line
wherever
it
might
be.
we
agree
on
that.
we
further
agree
that
if
the
river
suddenly
abandons
its
old
bed
and
carves
out
a
new
bed
by
--
in
a
very
short
period
of
time
by
an
avulsive
action
that
this
freezes
the
state
line
and
the
line
of
navigation,
the
sailing
channel
where
it
was
located
prior
to
the
avulsion
after
that
reach
of
the
river
has
ceased
to
be
a
flowing
stream.
so
--
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
no,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
the
application
of
the
law.
there's
one
other
point
of
law
which,
i
think,
we
are
in
agreement
on
and
that
is
this
that
in
the
brief
below,
arkansas
conceded
that
mississippi
had
made
a
prima
facie
case
and
that
the
burden
of
proof
rested
upon
them
to
establish
the
1872
avulsion.
this
was
quoted.
i
did
not
argue
it
in
my
brief
because
it
was
quoted
by
justice
--
by
the
special
master
and
was
not
controverted
by
arkansas.
that
is
the
law
anyway
as
i
understand
it
to
be
because
an
avulsion
is
an
extraordinary
thing
and
not
the
ordinary
thing
that
would
happen.
fortunately,
we
were
able
to
find
numerous
maps
and
charts,
direction
for
navigation,
reports
to
congress
involving
this
sector
of
the
river
over
some
approximately
200
of
them.
so
we
have
a
rarely
com
--
a
fairly
complete
historical
picture
of
this.
from
the
time
that
mississippi
and
arkansas
were
admitted
to
the
union,
there
are
numbers
of
maps
particularly
the
all
western
palette
which
was
--
gave
directions
to
navigators
and
which
included
maps
of
this
sector
of
the
river
which
stated
that
the
sailing
vessels
when
they
go
through
spanish
moss
bend
should
go
over
and
hold
hard
against
the
bed
--
against
the
bank
of
the
mississippi
river
thus
fixing
the
sailing
line
against
the
concave,
hard
bank
of
the
arkansas
river
from
1820
up
until
1860.
there's
not
--
the
largest
years
in
gap
in
this
period
of
time
was
only
nine
years,
so
we
have
a
graphic
depiction
of
the
fact
that
from
1820
to
1860,
there
seems
to
be
no
question
but
what
the
sailing
line,
the
thalweg,
the
channel
of
navigation
was
hard
against
the
arkansas
bank.
also,
during
that
time,
there
was
no
evidence
of
a
detached
bar
as
we
call
it,
a
piont
bar,
an
island
as
arkansas
call
it.
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
detached
land
mass
appearing
of
carter
point.
the
maps
all,
however,
did
show
that
attached
to
carter
point
there
was
building
and
continued
to
build
a
sandbar,
accretion
formation.
and
in
1863,
and
we
now
move
into
the
war
years,
a
law,
it's
1863
on
the
mississippi
river
which
was
drawn
up
for
the
purpose
of
showing
this
very
thing,
islands,
sandbags,
further
fortifications
and
land
--
and
mines
that
had
been
placed
out
--
was
printed
and
this
1863
map
goes
into
great
detail
showing
a
very
decided
sandbar
formation
attached
to
the
distal
end
of
carter
point,
mississippi
with
no
land
mass
formation
out
in
the
river.
following
the
end
of
the
civil
war
and
doing
the
efforts
to
reconstruct
the
south,
the
united
states
sent
a
--
general
humphreys
down
to
make
a
--
an
inspection
and
report,
particularly
on
the
condition
of
the
levees
along
the
mississippi
river.
the
levee
being
as
you
know
an
earth
and
bank
mud
that
is
thrown
up
at
that
time
parallel
within
quite
close
to
the
bank
line
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
contain
the
mississippi
waters
when
it
was
in
(voice
overlap).
this
report
that
mr.
--
that
general
humphreys
made
in
1866
to
congress
and
a
subsequent
report
that
he
made
to
congress
in
1869
reported
that
the
bank
was
caving
badly
in
this
bend
that
the
levees
had
fallen
into
a
state
of
disrepair
and
that
breaks
were
evident
in
the
levees
in
several
places,
all
in
this
spanish
moss
bend
area.
then
in
1872,
the
state
of
arkansas
also
became
concerned
with
this
and
they
appointed
a
surveyor
named
douglas,
to
make
surveys
of
the
existing
levees
and
to
make
recommendations
for
new
levees
to
take
the
place
of
the
gaps
into
old
levees.
this
is
a
first
historical
proof
of
the
existence
of
this
land
mass
known
as
luna
bar
in
a
situation
where
it
has
become
detached
from
carter
point.
mr.
douglas
surveyed
a
--
in
great
detail
the
arkansas
bank
there.
he
showed
farms.
he
showed
forests.
he
showed
sloughs.
he
showed
the
levees
in
place
and
levees
which
had
been
breached.
luna
bar,
he
did
not
designate
its
sect
but
in
the
river
over
against
the
mississippi
shore,
he
showed
and
i
--
a
formation
detached
from
the
shore
utterly
devoid
of
any
sculptural
symbolization
which
would
indicate,
we
have
no
report
of
mr.
douglas,
but
it
was
slightly
indicate
by
leaving
it
blank
that
he
did
not
consider
it
a
part
of
arkansas.
the
most
important
thing
about
douglas’
survey
however,
is
the
fact
that
he
locates
with
great
detail
the
then
existing
levee
system
with
its
breaks
which
coincide
exactly
to
the
reports
that
general
humphreys
made
through
congress
in
1866
and
1869.
and
the
engineering
witnesses
introduced
by
--
the
engineering
witness
and
it
was
only
engineering
witness
introduced
by
mississippi
was
able
to
overlay
subsequent
surveys
right
up
to
the
present
time
and
you
can
see
that
all
the
levee’s
prior
to
1860
in
place,
you
can
walk
them
both
sides
considered
they’re
there.
you
can
walk
them
along
the
bank,
on
the
arkansas
side.
there
is
no
levee
formation
or
whatsoever
on
luna
bar
which
is
some
2,000
the
crest
of
it
is
some
2,000
feet
to
the
east.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
no,
sir.
i
think
not.
there
was
some
testimony
of
an
old
house
site
on
luna
bar.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
cistern,
that’s
right
and
then
the
witness
putnam
(ph)
said,
he
thought
he
saw
a
chimney.
on
his
second
visit
back,
he
could
not
locate
the
chimney.
no
one
was
able
to
locate
any
habitation
on
luna
bar.
the
witness,
dr.
durham,
even
went
so
far
as
to
get
a
metal
detector
and
go
--
they
assumed
that
there
were
houses
there
because
there
were
chinaberry
trees.
in
that
part
of
the
country,
they
do
plant
chinaberry
trees
around
house
sites
so
they
saw
some
chinaberry
trees
also
brought
in
by
birds.
but
they
did
--
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
sorry.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
no,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
mississippi
is
arresting
people
on
luna
bar.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
by
game
violation.
there
has
not
been
one
--
this
really
started
the
series
of
suits
was
a
--
mississippi
making
these
arrests.
and
i
think
that’s
really
what
precipitated
the
litigation.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
litigation
and
we
thought
it
well
to
bring
it
to
--
in
a
proper
way.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
hunters,
yes.
one
was
a
hunter
from
missouri,
came
down
with
an
arkansas
license
and
was
arrested
and
tried
in
mississippi
and
another
one,
i
believe
had
in
arkansas
license
and
was
also
arrested.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
started
the
litigation
then
in
the
lower
courts.
one
suit
was
filed
in
the
district
court
at
greenville.
another
suit
was
filed
in
the
chancery
court
of
arkansas
and
we
were
getting
litigation
all
over
the
place
and
mississippi
decided
they
wanted
to
bring
it
here
then
have
some
definite
adjudication
of
where
the
line
was.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
deer
mostly
--
there
is
very
good
goose
and
duck
but
mainly
deer
and
the
turkey.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
carter
point
is
owned
by
a
lumber
company,
anderson-tully
company,
the
arkansas
bank
well,
right
north
of
carter
point
is
owned
by
chicago
mill
and
lumber
company
which
do
not
involve
in
this
suit
the
land
owners
to
the
west
of
various
one,
dr.
wells
is
now
dead,
mrs.
smith,
arkansas
land
&
cattle
company
and
then
they
have
further
owners,
further
other
owners
further
downstream
that
have
not
yet
become
involved
in
any
of
the
litigation.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
yes
sir.
on
that
duke
versus
deffrey
(ph),
they
recognized
that
private
litigants
can
settle
their
titles
one
by
one
if
they
finally
get
an
unappealable
decree
but
it
is
difficult
crossing
state
lines
to
get
personal
surveys
on
land
owners
and
to
make
a
decree
which
you
feel
confidence
in.
also
that
does
not
resolve
the
question
of
taxes.
there’s
the
question
of
criminal
jurisdiction
and
recently
there
has
been
a
good
bid
of
all
activity
in
washington
county
which
is
immediately
adjacent
to
that,
has
always
been
a
good
bid.
in
arkansas,
i’m
not
quite
sure
about
this
particular
county.
but
in
any
rate,
the
douglas
1872
survey
was
the
first
historical
evidence
of
this
situation
being
there.
also
in
1872,
louisiana
since
they
were
getting
the
water
when
the
water
flowed
through
the
breached
levees
in
arkansas,
they
flowed
downstream
and
came
in
to
what
is
known
as
the
tinsel
bottom
and
louisiana
also
sent,
a
captain
richardson
(ph)
up
to
make
an
investigation
and
report
and
he
made
a
report
in
1872
to
the
louisiana
levee
commissioner
reiterating
the
same
situation
found
in
humphreys’
reports.
in
addition
to
the
breaks
that
he
found
and
shown
on
douglas’
report,
he
found
an
additional
break
of
200
feet
in
the
levee.
the
important
thing
about
all
of
these
reports,
it
seems
to
me
is
this,
one,
no
mention
was
ever
made
of
an
avulsion
taking
place
in
1872
whereby
the
river
jumped
into
arkansas
and
caved
through
the
land
and
came
back
out.
the
geological
witnesses,
dr.
kolb,
from
mississippi,
dr.
--
mr.
spillers
(ph)
and
doctor
durham
from
louisiana
all
conceded
that
in
there
experience
as
geologist
and
all
of
the
geological
literature
there
had
never
been
any
mention
or
ever
has
any
history
of
any
such
phenomenon
taking
place
as
arkansas
claims
to
have
happened
here.
in
fact
dr.
kolb
said,
i
had
to
coin
the
phrase
and
he
called
it
an
outside
avulsion
and
said,
i
never
heard
of
it,
i
just
made
it
up.
mr.
spillers
made
one,
he
said
it’s
--
i
call
it
reoccupying
an
old
channel.
he
admitted
that
there
was
no
such
accepted
phrase
in
geologic
literature
and
he
said
he
had
to
coin
the
phrase
too.
so,
with
all
of
these
weighed
down
in
this
particular
narrow
sector
of
the
river
it
is
--
it
seems
to
be
incredible
that
if
this
phenomenon
took
place,
it
has
never
happened
before
and
it
never
happened
since
--
but
they
were
concerned
with
the
integrity
of
the
levees
when
they
were
concerned
with
trying
to
protect
the
backland
of
arkansas
from
flooding
that
they
would've
swept
this
remarkable
situation
under
the
road.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
significance
of
them?
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
mississippi
takes
a
position
that
those
of
stumps
of
trees
that
had
had
been
severed
from
their
bowl
in
years
past
and
had
floated
in
over
some
flood
in
preceding
years.
and
substantiation
of
that
position
which
we
think
is
a
valid
one.
the
two,
the
--
if
the
court
please,
one
of
the
old
mulberry
tree
was
found
on
the
lower
end
of
luna
bar,
the
other
two
trees
were
found
about
the
center,
west
center
portion
of
luna
bar.
the
remarkable
thing
about
it
was
that
they
--
that
these
witnesses
pinpointed
and
they
are
on
the
exhibits.
they
pinpointed
the
location
of
these
tree
stumps
which
they
said
--
they
thought
were
stumps
of
trees
in
place.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
one
of
them,
yes,
one
of
them
was
rooted,
one
was
--
been
over
and
was
not
real,
one
had
the
moss
on
the
roots,
it
couldn’t
have
been
putnam
--
that
mr.
putnam
before
said
it
was
rooted.
then
i
call
his
attention,
the
fact
that
there
was
moss
on
the
roots.
then
he
said,
well,
that
--
it
wouldn’t
have
moss
on
the
roots.
but
the
complete
refutation
of
that
in
our
opinion
is
this
that
the
witness,
smith,
the
all
--
all
of
these
maps
were
blown
up
to
a
common
scale,
one
foot
equal
20,000
feet,
one
to
20,000.
it’s
possible
by
getting
your
benchmarks,
your
levees
and
so
on
and
lining
them
up
to
overlay
and
--
transparent
overlay
is
made
of
all
these
exhibits.
to
put
one
exhibit
transparency
over
the
other
and
locate
various
geographical
points,
the
mulberry
stump
and
the
other
two
stumps
which
they
said
were
of
ancient
age,
in
1894
the
soil
was
in
and
one
place
was
10
feet
lower
and
another
15
feet
lower
and
another
place
20
feet
lower.
so
between
1894
and
1970,
when
mr.
putnam
went
on
to
luna
bar
there
had
been
a
filling
so
that
the
elevation
had
been
increased
from
1894
as
laymen,
i’d
say
fill,
it
had
been
filled
in.
the
elevation
had
been
increased
as
much
as
20
feet,
15
feet,
10
feet,
so
these
stumps
were
--
they
would've
hanging
in
the
air
if
they
had
been
there
in
1894.
in
the
meantime,
the
river
had
come
in
and
deposited
and
these
stumps
had
obviously
floated
in,
a
phenomenon
that’s
accepted
up
and
down
the
river.
it
floated
in
on
some
subsequent
rise
and
had
attached
there.
while
you
have
raised
the
question
of
forest,
we
find
with
exception
to
these
dead
trees,
which
we
didn’t
find,
we
never
could
locate,
and
they
found
them.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
no,
sir.
because
it
would've
been
impossible
because
they
grew
in
an
area
which
by
subsequent
maps
the
1882
survey,
mississippi
river
commission,
we
call
the
mrc
survey,
the
1894
survey,
they
show
subsequent
shows
--
survey
show
that
this
area
was
in
the
bed
of
the
river,
(voice
overlap).
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
otherwise,
we
would
have
to
disregard
those
facts.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
no,
sir.
i
wouldn’t
agree
to
that
because
--
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
i
would
have
to
say
yes,
i
would
have
to
assume
first
that
the
river
--
that
the
land
was
at
that
elevation.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
and
that
all
of
these
subsequent
maps
were
all
wrong.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
and
that
was
a
part
--
yes,
the
judge
o’sullivan
made
that
all
of
the
witnesses
for
arkansas
found
fault
with
these
ancient
maps
wherever
they
did
not
agree
with
that
theory.
and
that
was
a
way
they
wash
the
maps
out
because
he
said
it
doesn’t
agree
with
our
theory.
out
there,
it’d
been
that
the
--
why
stand
there
theory
being
that
the
group
but
i
can’t
get
over
the
fact
that
there
are
moss
on
one
of
the
roots
there
which
would
be
evidence
if
they
--
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
yes
and
all
the
maps
and
all
the
way
to
the
mississippi
river
commission.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
and
all
of
that
reports
to
congress
and
so
forth.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
yes,
sir.
in
1882,
and
this
would
bear
on
the
question
that
has
just
been
asked,
in
1882
the
mississippi
river
commission
made
the
first
--
the
definitive
control
survey
of
the
mississippi
valley,
this
was
done
with
great
care.
it
was
done
on
--
tied
in
with
trigonometry,
it
was
tied
in
with
longitude
and
latitude
and
they
got
the
elevations
and
my
time
is
running
short,
i
do
want
to
save
a
minute
but
those
surveys
showed
this
was
just
a
dry
sandbar
with
no
vegetation
on
it.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
i
have
--
i
can’t
agree
with
everything
that
mr.
drew
has
said.
for
instance
the
exhibit
by
the
master
here
shows
that
old
the
channel
completely
clogged
off
and
filled
with
sand
which
the
court
had
before
it.
the
question
of
forest
here,
it
is
not
trees
that
control,
it
is
the
question
of
the
forest,
the
type
of
the
forest.
the
testimony
here
is
that
this
was
an
alluvial
forest
and
that
the
growth
of
trees,
there
is
an
alluvial
forest
of
the
primary
species,
they’re
still
there,
40
years
old.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
state
of
mississippi
has
filed
this
original
action
asking
the
court
to
make
a
judicial
determination
of
a
disputed
boundary
line
between
the
two
states.
the
uncertainty
of
the
boundary
line
is
due
to
the
fact
that
it
is
located
in
an
abandoned
bend
of
the
mississippi
river
but
formerly
was
a
boundary
but
which
is
now
been
cut-off
by
the
action
of
the
u.s.
engineers
in
making
a
neck
cut-off
in
1935.
when
the
two
states
were
admitted
to
the
union,
the
acts
admitting
the
union
made
the
mississippi
river
the
common
boundary.
in
the
area
in
question,
the
river
loop
westward
and
southward
and
then
eastward
around
a
long
neck
of
land
which
was
located
in
mississippi
known
as
carter
point,
mississippi
and
this
map
have
depicted
in
the
arkansas-mississippi
refuge
quadrangle
was
attached
to
the
special
master’s
report,
the
honorable
clifford
o'sullivan.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
that’s
the
map
like
this.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
that’s
right,
appendix
a,
yes.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
the
black
line
on
this
map
shows
the
location
of
the
river
when
it
was
surveyed
by
the
surveyor
general
of
the
united
states.
it
is
the
contention
of
mississippi
that
from
about
1823
to
1830,
the
time
of
the
original
g.l.o.
surveys
that
the
river
migrated
slowly
and
imperceptibly
caving
in
to
the
arkansas
bank
and
adding
accretions
to
carter
point,
mississippi
until
such
time
as
it
moved
approximately
2,000
feet
to
the
west,
in
the
location
in
1935.
in
the
year
1935,
the
united
states
engineers
made
a
cut-off
across
the
neck
of
carter
point
which
is
shown
on
this
exhibit,
appendix
a,
thus,
diverting
the
flow
of
the
river
from
its
old
channel
around
the
carter
point
and
creating
a
new
channel
within
a
matter
of
some
three
months,
all
navigation
left
the
over
--
old
channel
and
adopted
the
new
channel
through
tarpley
point.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
yes,
that
area
around
luna
bar.
luna
bar
actually
created
the
problem.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
yes,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
its
--
by
now
it
has
probably
close
to
thousand
acres
of
land.
all
of
this
land
shown
in
spanish
moss
bend
has
filled
in.
there
have
been
numerous
problems
in
the
enforcement
of
criminal
law.
the
state
of
mississippi
arresting
residents
of
the
state
of
arkansas
on
this
bar
where
the
intended
confusion
about
which
state
has
criminal
jurisdiction.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
state
of
arkansas
that
this
gradual
migration
did
not
occur
but
that
in
the
year
1872,
the
river,
mississippi
river
suddenly
jumped,
caved
into
the
arkansas
bank,
went
over
bank,
scout
out
a
completely
new
channel
behind
the
mainland
of
arkansas
bank
and
then
re-entered
the
mississippi
channel
at
a
lower
area
there
thus,
creating
a
island
which
they
is
luna
island
and
not
luna
bar.
the
special
chancellor,
i
mean
the
special
master
resolved
this
conflict
in
favor
of
mississippi
and
we
are
here
today
on
exceptions
to
his
report.
we’re
not
sure
just
what
the
position
of
the
supreme
court
is
at
this
time
about
the
weight
to
be
given
or
the
finality
to
be
given
to
the
finding
of
a
special
master.
we
do
note
that
in
rule
9
(2)
of
the
supreme
court
rules
at
--
they
say
that
where
applicable,
the
federal
civil
rules
will
be
given
effect
and
in
rule
53
of
the
civil
rules,
it
is
provided
that
the
finding
--
factual
findings
of
a
master
will
not
be
disturbed
unless
clearly
erroneous.
actually,
we
are
in
agreement
with
mississippi
and
arkansas
in
agreement
with
the
basic
law
which
is
the
law
of
the
thalweg
and
we’re
really
here
arguing
a
point
of
fact
as
to
whether
the
finding
of
the
--
the
report
of
the
master
should
be
approved
on
that
finding.
we
both
agree
that
the
law
is
that
if
the
river
migrates
slowly
and
imperceptibly
and
the
thalweg
continues
to
cave
in
to
a
bank,
that
that
--
where
that
thalweg
is
the
boundary
line
between
states
that
that
changes
--
does
not
change
the
state
boundary
but
the
boundary
follows
the
deepest
line
of
navigation
of
sailing
line
or
thalweg
used
interchangeably
and
it
remains
the
state
line
wherever
it
might
be.
we
agree
on
that.
we
further
agree
that
if
the
river
suddenly
abandons
its
old
bed
and
carves
out
a
new
bed
by
--
in
a
very
short
period
of
time
by
an
avulsive
action
that
this
freezes
the
state
line
and
the
line
of
navigation,
the
sailing
channel
where
it
was
located
prior
to
the
avulsion
after
that
reach
of
the
river
has
ceased
to
be
a
flowing
stream.
so
--
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
no,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
the
application
of
the
law.
there's
one
other
point
of
law
which,
i
think,
we
are
in
agreement
on
and
that
is
this
that
in
the
brief
below,
arkansas
conceded
that
mississippi
had
made
a
prima
facie
case
and
that
the
burden
of
proof
rested
upon
them
to
establish
the
1872
avulsion.
this
was
quoted.
i
did
not
argue
it
in
my
brief
because
it
was
quoted
by
justice
--
by
the
special
master
and
was
not
controverted
by
arkansas.
that
is
the
law
anyway
as
i
understand
it
to
be
because
an
avulsion
is
an
extraordinary
thing
and
not
the
ordinary
thing
that
would
happen.
fortunately,
we
were
able
to
find
numerous
maps
and
charts,
direction
for
navigation,
reports
to
congress
involving
this
sector
of
the
river
over
some
approximately
200
of
them.
so
we
have
a
rarely
com
--
a
fairly
complete
historical
picture
of
this.
from
the
time
that
mississippi
and
arkansas
were
admitted
to
the
union,
there
are
numbers
of
maps
particularly
the
all
western
palette
which
was
--
gave
directions
to
navigators
and
which
included
maps
of
this
sector
of
the
river
which
stated
that
the
sailing
vessels
when
they
go
through
spanish
moss
bend
should
go
over
and
hold
hard
against
the
bed
--
against
the
bank
of
the
mississippi
river
thus
fixing
the
sailing
line
against
the
concave,
hard
bank
of
the
arkansas
river
from
1820
up
until
1860.
there's
not
--
the
largest
years
in
gap
in
this
period
of
time
was
only
nine
years,
so
we
have
a
graphic
depiction
of
the
fact
that
from
1820
to
1860,
there
seems
to
be
no
question
but
what
the
sailing
line,
the
thalweg,
the
channel
of
navigation
was
hard
against
the
arkansas
bank.
also,
during
that
time,
there
was
no
evidence
of
a
detached
bar
as
we
call
it,
a
piont
bar,
an
island
as
arkansas
call
it.
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
detached
land
mass
appearing
of
carter
point.
the
maps
all,
however,
did
show
that
attached
to
carter
point
there
was
building
and
continued
to
build
a
sandbar,
accretion
formation.
and
in
1863,
and
we
now
move
into
the
war
years,
a
law,
it's
1863
on
the
mississippi
river
which
was
drawn
up
for
the
purpose
of
showing
this
very
thing,
islands,
sandbags,
further
fortifications
and
land
--
and
mines
that
had
been
placed
out
--
was
printed
and
this
1863
map
goes
into
great
detail
showing
a
very
decided
sandbar
formation
attached
to
the
distal
end
of
carter
point,
mississippi
with
no
land
mass
formation
out
in
the
river.
following
the
end
of
the
civil
war
and
doing
the
efforts
to
reconstruct
the
south,
the
united
states
sent
a
--
general
humphreys
down
to
make
a
--
an
inspection
and
report,
particularly
on
the
condition
of
the
levees
along
the
mississippi
river.
the
levee
being
as
you
know
an
earth
and
bank
mud
that
is
thrown
up
at
that
time
parallel
within
quite
close
to
the
bank
line
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
contain
the
mississippi
waters
when
it
was
in
(voice
overlap).
this
report
that
mr.
--
that
general
humphreys
made
in
1866
to
congress
and
a
subsequent
report
that
he
made
to
congress
in
1869
reported
that
the
bank
was
caving
badly
in
this
bend
that
the
levees
had
fallen
into
a
state
of
disrepair
and
that
breaks
were
evident
in
the
levees
in
several
places,
all
in
this
spanish
moss
bend
area.
then
in
1872,
the
state
of
arkansas
also
became
concerned
with
this
and
they
appointed
a
surveyor
named
douglas,
to
make
surveys
of
the
existing
levees
and
to
make
recommendations
for
new
levees
to
take
the
place
of
the
gaps
into
old
levees.
this
is
a
first
historical
proof
of
the
existence
of
this
land
mass
known
as
luna
bar
in
a
situation
where
it
has
become
detached
from
carter
point.
mr.
douglas
surveyed
a
--
in
great
detail
the
arkansas
bank
there.
he
showed
farms.
he
showed
forests.
he
showed
sloughs.
he
showed
the
levees
in
place
and
levees
which
had
been
breached.
luna
bar,
he
did
not
designate
its
sect
but
in
the
river
over
against
the
mississippi
shore,
he
showed
and
i
--
a
formation
detached
from
the
shore
utterly
devoid
of
any
sculptural
symbolization
which
would
indicate,
we
have
no
report
of
mr.
douglas,
but
it
was
slightly
indicate
by
leaving
it
blank
that
he
did
not
consider
it
a
part
of
arkansas.
the
most
important
thing
about
douglas’
survey
however,
is
the
fact
that
he
locates
with
great
detail
the
then
existing
levee
system
with
its
breaks
which
coincide
exactly
to
the
reports
that
general
humphreys
made
through
congress
in
1866
and
1869.
and
the
engineering
witnesses
introduced
by
--
the
engineering
witness
and
it
was
only
engineering
witness
introduced
by
mississippi
was
able
to
overlay
subsequent
surveys
right
up
to
the
present
time
and
you
can
see
that
all
the
levee’s
prior
to
1860
in
place,
you
can
walk
them
both
sides
considered
they’re
there.
you
can
walk
them
along
the
bank,
on
the
arkansas
side.
there
is
no
levee
formation
or
whatsoever
on
luna
bar
which
is
some
2,000
the
crest
of
it
is
some
2,000
feet
to
the
east.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
no,
sir.
i
think
not.
there
was
some
testimony
of
an
old
house
site
on
luna
bar.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
cistern,
that’s
right
and
then
the
witness
putnam
(ph)
said,
he
thought
he
saw
a
chimney.
on
his
second
visit
back,
he
could
not
locate
the
chimney.
no
one
was
able
to
locate
any
habitation
on
luna
bar.
the
witness,
dr.
durham,
even
went
so
far
as
to
get
a
metal
detector
and
go
--
they
assumed
that
there
were
houses
there
because
there
were
chinaberry
trees.
in
that
part
of
the
country,
they
do
plant
chinaberry
trees
around
house
sites
so
they
saw
some
chinaberry
trees
also
brought
in
by
birds.
but
they
did
--
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
sorry.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
no,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
mississippi
is
arresting
people
on
luna
bar.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
by
game
violation.
there
has
not
been
one
--
this
really
started
the
series
of
suits
was
a
--
mississippi
making
these
arrests.
and
i
think
that’s
really
what
precipitated
the
litigation.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
litigation
and
we
thought
it
well
to
bring
it
to
--
in
a
proper
way.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
hunters,
yes.
one
was
a
hunter
from
missouri,
came
down
with
an
arkansas
license
and
was
arrested
and
tried
in
mississippi
and
another
one,
i
believe
had
in
arkansas
license
and
was
also
arrested.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
started
the
litigation
then
in
the
lower
courts.
one
suit
was
filed
in
the
district
court
at
greenville.
another
suit
was
filed
in
the
chancery
court
of
arkansas
and
we
were
getting
litigation
all
over
the
place
and
mississippi
decided
they
wanted
to
bring
it
here
then
have
some
definite
adjudication
of
where
the
line
was.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
deer
mostly
--
there
is
very
good
goose
and
duck
but
mainly
deer
and
the
turkey.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
carter
point
is
owned
by
a
lumber
company,
anderson-tully
company,
the
arkansas
bank
well,
right
north
of
carter
point
is
owned
by
chicago
mill
and
lumber
company
which
do
not
involve
in
this
suit
the
land
owners
to
the
west
of
various
one,
dr.
wells
is
now
dead,
mrs.
smith,
arkansas
land
&
cattle
company
and
then
they
have
further
owners,
further
other
owners
further
downstream
that
have
not
yet
become
involved
in
any
of
the
litigation.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
yes
sir.
on
that
duke
versus
deffrey
(ph),
they
recognized
that
private
litigants
can
settle
their
titles
one
by
one
if
they
finally
get
an
unappealable
decree
but
it
is
difficult
crossing
state
lines
to
get
personal
surveys
on
land
owners
and
to
make
a
decree
which
you
feel
confidence
in.
also
that
does
not
resolve
the
question
of
taxes.
there’s
the
question
of
criminal
jurisdiction
and
recently
there
has
been
a
good
bid
of
all
activity
in
washington
county
which
is
immediately
adjacent
to
that,
has
always
been
a
good
bid.
in
arkansas,
i’m
not
quite
sure
about
this
particular
county.
but
in
any
rate,
the
douglas
1872
survey
was
the
first
historical
evidence
of
this
situation
being
there.
also
in
1872,
louisiana
since
they
were
getting
the
water
when
the
water
flowed
through
the
breached
levees
in
arkansas,
they
flowed
downstream
and
came
in
to
what
is
known
as
the
tinsel
bottom
and
louisiana
also
sent,
a
captain
richardson
(ph)
up
to
make
an
investigation
and
report
and
he
made
a
report
in
1872
to
the
louisiana
levee
commissioner
reiterating
the
same
situation
found
in
humphreys’
reports.
in
addition
to
the
breaks
that
he
found
and
shown
on
douglas’
report,
he
found
an
additional
break
of
200
feet
in
the
levee.
the
important
thing
about
all
of
these
reports,
it
seems
to
me
is
this,
one,
no
mention
was
ever
made
of
an
avulsion
taking
place
in
1872
whereby
the
river
jumped
into
arkansas
and
caved
through
the
land
and
came
back
out.
the
geological
witnesses,
dr.
kolb,
from
mississippi,
dr.
--
mr.
spillers
(ph)
and
doctor
durham
from
louisiana
all
conceded
that
in
there
experience
as
geologist
and
all
of
the
geological
literature
there
had
never
been
any
mention
or
ever
has
any
history
of
any
such
phenomenon
taking
place
as
arkansas
claims
to
have
happened
here.
in
fact
dr.
kolb
said,
i
had
to
coin
the
phrase
and
he
called
it
an
outside
avulsion
and
said,
i
never
heard
of
it,
i
just
made
it
up.
mr.
spillers
made
one,
he
said
it’s
--
i
call
it
reoccupying
an
old
channel.
he
admitted
that
there
was
no
such
accepted
phrase
in
geologic
literature
and
he
said
he
had
to
coin
the
phrase
too.
so,
with
all
of
these
weighed
down
in
this
particular
narrow
sector
of
the
river
it
is
--
it
seems
to
be
incredible
that
if
this
phenomenon
took
place,
it
has
never
happened
before
and
it
never
happened
since
--
but
they
were
concerned
with
the
integrity
of
the
levees
when
they
were
concerned
with
trying
to
protect
the
backland
of
arkansas
from
flooding
that
they
would've
swept
this
remarkable
situation
under
the
road.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
significance
of
them?
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
mississippi
takes
a
position
that
those
of
stumps
of
trees
that
had
had
been
severed
from
their
bowl
in
years
past
and
had
floated
in
over
some
flood
in
preceding
years.
and
substantiation
of
that
position
which
we
think
is
a
valid
one.
the
two,
the
--
if
the
court
please,
one
of
the
old
mulberry
tree
was
found
on
the
lower
end
of
luna
bar,
the
other
two
trees
were
found
about
the
center,
west
center
portion
of
luna
bar.
the
remarkable
thing
about
it
was
that
they
--
that
these
witnesses
pinpointed
and
they
are
on
the
exhibits.
they
pinpointed
the
location
of
these
tree
stumps
which
they
said
--
they
thought
were
stumps
of
trees
in
place.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
one
of
them,
yes,
one
of
them
was
rooted,
one
was
--
been
over
and
was
not
real,
one
had
the
moss
on
the
roots,
it
couldn’t
have
been
putnam
--
that
mr.
putnam
before
said
it
was
rooted.
then
i
call
his
attention,
the
fact
that
there
was
moss
on
the
roots.
then
he
said,
well,
that
--
it
wouldn’t
have
moss
on
the
roots.
but
the
complete
refutation
of
that
in
our
opinion
is
this
that
the
witness,
smith,
the
all
--
all
of
these
maps
were
blown
up
to
a
common
scale,
one
foot
equal
20,000
feet,
one
to
20,000.
it’s
possible
by
getting
your
benchmarks,
your
levees
and
so
on
and
lining
them
up
to
overlay
and
--
transparent
overlay
is
made
of
all
these
exhibits.
to
put
one
exhibit
transparency
over
the
other
and
locate
various
geographical
points,
the
mulberry
stump
and
the
other
two
stumps
which
they
said
were
of
ancient
age,
in
1894
the
soil
was
in
and
one
place
was
10
feet
lower
and
another
15
feet
lower
and
another
place
20
feet
lower.
so
between
1894
and
1970,
when
mr.
putnam
went
on
to
luna
bar
there
had
been
a
filling
so
that
the
elevation
had
been
increased
from
1894
as
laymen,
i’d
say
fill,
it
had
been
filled
in.
the
elevation
had
been
increased
as
much
as
20
feet,
15
feet,
10
feet,
so
these
stumps
were
--
they
would've
hanging
in
the
air
if
they
had
been
there
in
1894.
in
the
meantime,
the
river
had
come
in
and
deposited
and
these
stumps
had
obviously
floated
in,
a
phenomenon
that’s
accepted
up
and
down
the
river.
it
floated
in
on
some
subsequent
rise
and
had
attached
there.
while
you
have
raised
the
question
of
forest,
we
find
with
exception
to
these
dead
trees,
which
we
didn’t
find,
we
never
could
locate,
and
they
found
them.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
no,
sir.
because
it
would've
been
impossible
because
they
grew
in
an
area
which
by
subsequent
maps
the
1882
survey,
mississippi
river
commission,
we
call
the
mrc
survey,
the
1894
survey,
they
show
subsequent
shows
--
survey
show
that
this
area
was
in
the
bed
of
the
river,
(voice
overlap).
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
otherwise,
we
would
have
to
disregard
those
facts.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
no,
sir.
i
wouldn’t
agree
to
that
because
--
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
i
would
have
to
say
yes,
i
would
have
to
assume
first
that
the
river
--
that
the
land
was
at
that
elevation.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
and
that
all
of
these
subsequent
maps
were
all
wrong.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
and
that
was
a
part
--
yes,
the
judge
o’sullivan
made
that
all
of
the
witnesses
for
arkansas
found
fault
with
these
ancient
maps
wherever
they
did
not
agree
with
that
theory.
and
that
was
a
way
they
wash
the
maps
out
because
he
said
it
doesn’t
agree
with
our
theory.
out
there,
it’d
been
that
the
--
why
stand
there
theory
being
that
the
group
but
i
can’t
get
over
the
fact
that
there
are
moss
on
one
of
the
roots
there
which
would
be
evidence
if
they
--
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
yes
and
all
the
maps
and
all
the
way
to
the
mississippi
river
commission.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
and
all
of
that
reports
to
congress
and
so
forth.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
yes,
sir.
in
1882,
and
this
would
bear
on
the
question
that
has
just
been
asked,
in
1882
the
mississippi
river
commission
made
the
first
--
the
definitive
control
survey
of
the
mississippi
valley,
this
was
done
with
great
care.
it
was
done
on
--
tied
in
with
trigonometry,
it
was
tied
in
with
longitude
and
latitude
and
they
got
the
elevations
and
my
time
is
running
short,
i
do
want
to
save
a
minute
but
those
surveys
showed
this
was
just
a
dry
sandbar
with
no
vegetation
on
it.
mr.
mitchell
e.
ward
i
have
--
i
can’t
agree
with
everything
that
mr.
drew
has
said.
for
instance
the
exhibit
by
the
master
here
shows
that
old
the
channel
completely
clogged
off
and
filled
with
sand
which
the
court
had
before
it.
the
question
of
forest
here,
it
is
not
trees
that
control,
it
is
the
question
of
the
forest,
the
type
of
the
forest.
the
testimony
here
is
that
this
was
an
alluvial
forest
and
that
the
growth
of
trees,
there
is
an
alluvial
forest
of
the
primary
species,
they’re
still
there,
40
years
old.
