mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
today
to
speak
in
behalf
of
the
appellant
hainsworth
and
also
in
behalf
of
those
others
we
have
endeavored
to
become
independent
candidates
in
the
state
of
texas
over
the
years
and
have
not
quite
been
able
to
make
it.
to
become
an
independent
candidate
in
texas,
one
has
to
meet
the
requirements
of
article
13.50
of
the
texas
election
code
which
provides
among
other
things
that
the
candidate
must
obtain
a
certain
percentage
of
the
votes
of
a
certain
number
of
the
people
who
cast
the
ballot
for
governors
both
democratic
and
republican
at
the
last
preceding
general
election.
in
addition
to
that,
if
the
candidate
is
from
a
one
county
district,
he
has
to
get
5%.
if
the
candidate
is
from
a
district
composed
of
one
or
more
counties,
then
the
candidate
is
only
required
to
get
3%
of
the
vote.
so
there
is
some
variance
even
with
respect
to
candidates
depending
upon
the
number
of
counties
in
the
district.
in
addition,
the
independent
candidate
has
to
obtain
notarized
signatures
from
each
sign
or
of
his
application.
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
independent
candidate
is
proscribed
in
making
his
efforts
to
canvass
for
signatures
in
that
those
who
have
participated
in
the
first
primary,
either
democratic
or
republican
and
those
who
have
voted
in
the
second
primary,
a
row
of
primary
but
not
eligible
to
be
canvassed
by
the
independent
candidate
for
that
particular
office.
provided,
anybody
has
been
a
candidate
in
those
primaries,
there
were
two
primaries.
that
in
effect
limits
the
independent
candidate
to
about
50%
of
the
voters
in
his
district.
now
the
appellant
in
this
case
was
a
candidate
for
state
representative
in
district
24
--
district
2886
and
this
particular
county
is
a
single
number
district
and
they
are
approximately
23
to
24
single
member
district
in
harris
county,
texas.
now,
approximately
74,000
75,000
people
in
each
state
representative
district
and
it
is
difficult
to
beat
those
requirements
of
the
state
statute,
article
13.50
in
order
to
qualify
as
an
independent
candidate.
in
addition,
another
difficulty
is
the
requirement
that
you
must
get
those
signatures
within
30
days.
thirty
days
after
the
close
of
second
primary
day
which
usually
comes
about
3rd
of
july
dated
1972.
the
three-judge
district
court
in
deciding
the
consolidated
cases
stated
in
its
opinion
that
this
consolidated
cases
fell
in
between
williams
versus
rhodes
and
jenness
versus
fortson.
in
that
the
supreme
court
in
the
williams
case
was
working
on
one
end
of
the
spectrum
and
in
the
fortson
case
they’re
working
on
the
other
and
that
the
facts
in
these
consolidated
cases
now
before
the
court
fell
exactly
in
between.
however,
it
seem
to
me
that
the
jenness
case
was
the
one
that
the
three-judge
district
court
should
have
applied
in
making
its
decision
because
in
that
particular
case
are
laid
down
some
rules
and
possibly
it
may
be
stated
that
the
state
of
georgia
had
set
forth
the
requirements
they
did
consider
appropriate
for
independent
candidates
and
it
may
be
that
they
were
very,
very
liberal
but
it
seems
to
me
that
they
were
very,
very
fair
and
i
would
like
to
submit
to
the
court
that
they
should
give
considerations
here
as
consideration
to
following
the
jenness
case
in
its
requirements
insofar
as
independent
candidates
are
concerned.
in
that
particular
case,
no
notary
public
was
required
in
that
particular
state
insofar
as
an
independent
candidate
was
concerned
in
getting
on
the
ballot.
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
the
matter
is
one
of
expense
for
one
thing
and
another
is
a
matter
of
getting
--
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
well,
the
notary
public
fee
by
state
statute
in
texas
is
50
cents
for
each
notarization.
however,
when
you
have
to
go
out
--
whenever
a
notary
public
goes
out
of
his
office
to
notarize
something,
it
always
cost
more
and
of
course
if
you
are
an
independent
candidate
or
you’re
trying
to
become
an
independent
candidate,
you
got
to
get
a
notary
public,
he
will
go
around
with
you
and
walk
and
walk
and
notarized
as
necessary
whenever
you
can
get
somebody
who
is
willing
to
sign
your
application
and
[interruption]
for
a
dollar
for
a
signature.
it
may
want
even
more,
in
those
you
get
may
be
kind
of
feeble
and
not
able
to
keep
up
so
you
kind
of
hump
it.
it
puts
a
burden
upon
independent
candidate
--
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
well,
there
is
an
old
proscribed
by
state
statute
which
says
something
like
this,
“i
solemnly
swear
that
i
have
not
participated
in
any
primary
first
or
second
held
this
year
to
nominate
a
candidate
for
the
office
for
which
i
desire,
john
jones,
an
independent
candidate
to
be
a
candidate
for
and
so
on.”
that
is
in
substance
what’s
in
the
oath.
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
well,
this
is
what
the
application
is
going
up
so
that
he
can
be
for
each
individual
sign
up
or
it
can
be
drawn
up
so
that
10,
15
to
20
persons
can
sign
the
same
application.
but
if
each
answers
that
notary
public
has
to
appear,
the
person
ask
you
a
fee
before
the
notary
public
can
have
him
to
swear
that
he
is
stating
the
truth
and
of
course
that
kind
of
limits
some
people
because
people
somewhat
don’t
like
to
make
an
oath.
they
are
kind
of
reluctant.
so
that
kind
of
detours
some
individuals
from
taking
the
--
for
taking
the
oath
and
that
takes
away
from
the
applicant
in
getting
signatures.
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
well,
now
of
course
we
are
dealing
with
an
independent
candidate
and
use
an
independent
candidate
is
working
alone.
and
he
is
trying
to
get
somebody
to
help
him
and
he
is
not
able
to
get
anybody
to
go
out
for
him
and
pay
them
too.
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
well,
i
think
this
your
honor
the
friendship
comes
when
the
independent
candidate
himself
goes
and
speaks
to
the
individual
and
the
individual
will
readily
sign.
i
think
that
is
the
kind
of
friendship
--
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
well,
no
sir.
i
wouldn’t
object
to
that.
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
well,
it
goes
to
the
notarization
and
of
course
not
for
the
one,
for
the
notarization.
i
could
go
out
myself
and
get
500
signatures
without
any
hesitancy
but
we
have
to
take
a
new
republic
along
involving
more
press
than
notary
public
not
have
to
wait
until
he
catches
up.
and
i’ve
got
to
go
to
those
and
let
it
know
that
these
won’t
sign
about
the
keep
going,
keep
going.
well,
i
can
work
all
day
and
i
make
it
15
and
that
is
the
way
it
goes
with
it.
now
that
in
his
after
notarization
would
be
all
right
if
you
had
say
90
days
or
60
days
but
you
only
have
30
days
so
they
cut
you
both
ways.
if
the
notarization
provision
is
there
and
if
i
could
wait
for
any
independent
candidate
could
wait
60
days,
you
get
the
500
signatures
but
when
you
have
to
have
it
notarized,
you
only
limited
to
30
days
and
then
you
exclude
it
from
those
who
voted
democratic
and
republican
primaries
or
you
cut
so
far
down
and
you
don’t
know
who
to
go
to,
you
have
to
go
from
house
to
house
and
may
have
voted.
they
say,
“i
would
sign
but
i
voted
already.”
so
it’s
lots
of
handicaps
and
avoidance
that
you
have
to
undergo
in
order
to
try
and
qualify.
of
course
it
is
not
even
impossible,
that
if
i
have
been
able
to
have
foreseen
the
many
months
of
work
that
i’ll
have
to
undergo
to
get
here.
i
believe
i
will
wait
for
90
days
to
have
made
it.
and
i
think
i
will
say,
“you
should
die.”[laughter]
however,
i
am
hoping
that
my
appearance
here
will
serve
to
make
the
court
aware
of
the
problems
of
an
independent
candidate
in
that
--
an
independent
candidate
is
striving
to
help
to
make
--
help
make
the
county
stronger
and
--
well,
an
independent
candidate
goes
out
for
a
smaller
office.
he
does
not
expect
the
real
great
influence.
it’s
just
the
matter
of
trying
the
champion
somehow
the
government
that
he
has
and
if
he
admits
with
the
approval
of
the
people,
and
he
is
able
to
get
elected,
fine.
of
course,
an
independent
candidate
gets
on
the
joint
election
ballot.
he
still
has
the
democratic
party
and
the
republican
party
to
defeat
and
he
is
strictly
underdog.
he’s
got
a
hard
fight
on
his
hands
and
he
gets
no
funding
and
no
financing
like
the
democratic
party
does.
it’s
all
coming
out
of
his
pocket.
in
latter
times,
the
democratic
party
candidate
or
republican
party
candidate
don’t
have
any
opposition.
once
they
get
good
nomination,
which
in
many
cases
tantamount
to
election,
where
they
are
in.
you
don’t
have
any
joint
election
opposition.
so
all
they
have
to
do
is
struggle
to
get
on
the
primary
ballot
as
the
nominee
and
then
they
are
just
about
in.
but
lots
of
times
the
--
they
may
have
an
opposition
candidate
in
the
primary
and
none
in
the
joint
election
and
then
they
may
not
have
even
a
opposing
candidate
in
the
primary.
sometimes
it’s
just
a
show
hand
and
of
course
it
all
depends
upon
what
the
office
is
that
the
candidate
is
running
for.
now
i
hope
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
a
rebuttal
if
i
may.
i
don’t
know
what
i’ve
gone
over
it
or
not.
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
a
few
points
that
i
would
like
to
attempt
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court.
one,
after
the
case
of
bullock
versus
carter
that
party
primary
filing
fees
were
lowered
in
the
case
of
state
representative
to
the
sum
of
$200.00.
the
ultimate
nominating
petition
provided
that
2%
of
the
vote
cast
for
governor
of
the
party
in
the
last
preceding
general
election
would
be
sufficient
in
that
area
for
the
person
to
get
on
the
party
primary
balloting.
and
it
should
be
at
least
25
signatures
but
not
to
exceed
300.
i
would
like
to
make
this
distinction
that
the
5%
of
the
persons
who
voted
in
the
area
applies
in
the
article
13.50
to
all
who
cast
a
vote
for
governor
in
the
last
preceding
general
election.
you
may
have
a
democratic
and
republican
running
or
some
other
candidate
under
another
name
but
you
add
all
of
those
in
together
to
get
the
5%
in
that
particular
area
or
district
whereas
the
party
--
primary
nominee
only
has
to
get
5%
of
the
--
no
not
5%,
only
2%
of
the
total
number
of
votes
cast
for
the
governor
of
his
party.
so
it’s
maybe
down
the
25
and
it
maybe
but
it’s
not
to
exceed
300.
and
if
the
major
party
back
to
republican
court
in
texas,
if
that
candidate
for
governor
in
this
district
only
gets
1000
votes,
2%
of
that
would
be
about
20
and
that
would
put
him
in
the
primary.
now,
with
respect
to
notarization
under
the
old
law
with
respect
to
party
primary
candidates,
that
was
nothing
said
in
it
about
notarization.
so
i
presume
that
they
could
have
that
petition
signed
without
having
it
notarized.
is
all
--
they
also
provide
it
that
they
had
90
days
to
get
those
signatures
to
party
primary
candidate
but
the
independent
candidate
on
article
13.50
only
has
30
days.
now,
the
honorable
attorney
general
mr.
hill
was
talking
about
both
minor
party
--
minor
parties
and
independent
candidates
and
there
is
some
distinction
between
those
two.
now
an
independent
candidate
in
order
to
get
on
the
ballot
has
to
have
5%
of
the
votes
cast
in
that
area
or
district
for
that
particular
office
whereas
the
minor
party
candidate
only
has
to
get
1%
only
1%
of
a
vote
cast
either
for
a
general
--
for
governors
throughout
the
state
or
for
whatever.
but
he
is
only
has
to
get
1%.
now
the
independent
candidate
only
had
to
get
1%,
that
would
be
just
fine
but
they
have
made
it
5%
and
when
you
add
in
30
days
limitation
and
notarization.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
too
large
of
burden
placed
upon
the
independent
candidate.
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
the
independent
candidate
has
to
get
500.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
well
now,
it’s
likely
as
you
suppose
to
get
either
5%
--
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
or
500
then
you
can
take
the
less
--
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
never
have
to
get
more
than
500.
however,
the
5%
may
be
more
than
500.
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
not
in
every
case,
yes
sir.
equal
protection
of
the
laws
for
independent
candidates,
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
the
opinion
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
hainsworth
versus
bullock
and
hainsworth
versus
white
before
this
court
be
reversed
on
the
grounds
that
the
requirements
under
article
13.50
are
so
strict
and
burdensome
that
there
is
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
section
1
of
united
states
constitution
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
that
there
is
no
compelling
state
interest
involved
in
this
situation
or
in
this
case
which
requires
the
state
of
texas
to
have
this
particular
article
13.50
with
respect
to
an
independent
candidate
getting
on
the
ballot.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
here
today
to
speak
in
behalf
of
the
appellant
hainsworth
and
also
in
behalf
of
those
others
we
have
endeavored
to
become
independent
candidates
in
the
state
of
texas
over
the
years
and
have
not
quite
been
able
to
make
it.
to
become
an
independent
candidate
in
texas,
one
has
to
meet
the
requirements
of
article
13.50
of
the
texas
election
code
which
provides
among
other
things
that
the
candidate
must
obtain
a
certain
percentage
of
the
votes
of
a
certain
number
of
the
people
who
cast
the
ballot
for
governors
both
democratic
and
republican
at
the
last
preceding
general
election.
in
addition
to
that,
if
the
candidate
is
from
a
one
county
district,
he
has
to
get
5%.
if
the
candidate
is
from
a
district
composed
of
one
or
more
counties,
then
the
candidate
is
only
required
to
get
3%
of
the
vote.
so
there
is
some
variance
even
with
respect
to
candidates
depending
upon
the
number
of
counties
in
the
district.
in
addition,
the
independent
candidate
has
to
obtain
notarized
signatures
from
each
sign
or
of
his
application.
and
in
addition
to
that,
the
independent
candidate
is
proscribed
in
making
his
efforts
to
canvass
for
signatures
in
that
those
who
have
participated
in
the
first
primary,
either
democratic
or
republican
and
those
who
have
voted
in
the
second
primary,
a
row
of
primary
but
not
eligible
to
be
canvassed
by
the
independent
candidate
for
that
particular
office.
provided,
anybody
has
been
a
candidate
in
those
primaries,
there
were
two
primaries.
that
in
effect
limits
the
independent
candidate
to
about
50%
of
the
voters
in
his
district.
now
the
appellant
in
this
case
was
a
candidate
for
state
representative
in
district
24
--
district
2886
and
this
particular
county
is
a
single
number
district
and
they
are
approximately
23
to
24
single
member
district
in
harris
county,
texas.
now,
approximately
74,000
75,000
people
in
each
state
representative
district
and
it
is
difficult
to
beat
those
requirements
of
the
state
statute,
article
13.50
in
order
to
qualify
as
an
independent
candidate.
in
addition,
another
difficulty
is
the
requirement
that
you
must
get
those
signatures
within
30
days.
thirty
days
after
the
close
of
second
primary
day
which
usually
comes
about
3rd
of
july
dated
1972.
the
three-judge
district
court
in
deciding
the
consolidated
cases
stated
in
its
opinion
that
this
consolidated
cases
fell
in
between
williams
versus
rhodes
and
jenness
versus
fortson.
in
that
the
supreme
court
in
the
williams
case
was
working
on
one
end
of
the
spectrum
and
in
the
fortson
case
they’re
working
on
the
other
and
that
the
facts
in
these
consolidated
cases
now
before
the
court
fell
exactly
in
between.
however,
it
seem
to
me
that
the
jenness
case
was
the
one
that
the
three-judge
district
court
should
have
applied
in
making
its
decision
because
in
that
particular
case
are
laid
down
some
rules
and
possibly
it
may
be
stated
that
the
state
of
georgia
had
set
forth
the
requirements
they
did
consider
appropriate
for
independent
candidates
and
it
may
be
that
they
were
very,
very
liberal
but
it
seems
to
me
that
they
were
very,
very
fair
and
i
would
like
to
submit
to
the
court
that
they
should
give
considerations
here
as
consideration
to
following
the
jenness
case
in
its
requirements
insofar
as
independent
candidates
are
concerned.
in
that
particular
case,
no
notary
public
was
required
in
that
particular
state
insofar
as
an
independent
candidate
was
concerned
in
getting
on
the
ballot.
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
the
matter
is
one
of
expense
for
one
thing
and
another
is
a
matter
of
getting
--
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
well,
the
notary
public
fee
by
state
statute
in
texas
is
50
cents
for
each
notarization.
however,
when
you
have
to
go
out
--
whenever
a
notary
public
goes
out
of
his
office
to
notarize
something,
it
always
cost
more
and
of
course
if
you
are
an
independent
candidate
or
you’re
trying
to
become
an
independent
candidate,
you
got
to
get
a
notary
public,
he
will
go
around
with
you
and
walk
and
walk
and
notarized
as
necessary
whenever
you
can
get
somebody
who
is
willing
to
sign
your
application
and
[interruption]
for
a
dollar
for
a
signature.
it
may
want
even
more,
in
those
you
get
may
be
kind
of
feeble
and
not
able
to
keep
up
so
you
kind
of
hump
it.
it
puts
a
burden
upon
independent
candidate
--
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
well,
there
is
an
old
proscribed
by
state
statute
which
says
something
like
this,
“i
solemnly
swear
that
i
have
not
participated
in
any
primary
first
or
second
held
this
year
to
nominate
a
candidate
for
the
office
for
which
i
desire,
john
jones,
an
independent
candidate
to
be
a
candidate
for
and
so
on.”
that
is
in
substance
what’s
in
the
oath.
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
well,
this
is
what
the
application
is
going
up
so
that
he
can
be
for
each
individual
sign
up
or
it
can
be
drawn
up
so
that
10,
15
to
20
persons
can
sign
the
same
application.
but
if
each
answers
that
notary
public
has
to
appear,
the
person
ask
you
a
fee
before
the
notary
public
can
have
him
to
swear
that
he
is
stating
the
truth
and
of
course
that
kind
of
limits
some
people
because
people
somewhat
don’t
like
to
make
an
oath.
they
are
kind
of
reluctant.
so
that
kind
of
detours
some
individuals
from
taking
the
--
for
taking
the
oath
and
that
takes
away
from
the
applicant
in
getting
signatures.
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
well,
now
of
course
we
are
dealing
with
an
independent
candidate
and
use
an
independent
candidate
is
working
alone.
and
he
is
trying
to
get
somebody
to
help
him
and
he
is
not
able
to
get
anybody
to
go
out
for
him
and
pay
them
too.
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
well,
i
think
this
your
honor
the
friendship
comes
when
the
independent
candidate
himself
goes
and
speaks
to
the
individual
and
the
individual
will
readily
sign.
i
think
that
is
the
kind
of
friendship
--
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
well,
no
sir.
i
wouldn’t
object
to
that.
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
well,
it
goes
to
the
notarization
and
of
course
not
for
the
one,
for
the
notarization.
i
could
go
out
myself
and
get
500
signatures
without
any
hesitancy
but
we
have
to
take
a
new
republic
along
involving
more
press
than
notary
public
not
have
to
wait
until
he
catches
up.
and
i’ve
got
to
go
to
those
and
let
it
know
that
these
won’t
sign
about
the
keep
going,
keep
going.
well,
i
can
work
all
day
and
i
make
it
15
and
that
is
the
way
it
goes
with
it.
now
that
in
his
after
notarization
would
be
all
right
if
you
had
say
90
days
or
60
days
but
you
only
have
30
days
so
they
cut
you
both
ways.
if
the
notarization
provision
is
there
and
if
i
could
wait
for
any
independent
candidate
could
wait
60
days,
you
get
the
500
signatures
but
when
you
have
to
have
it
notarized,
you
only
limited
to
30
days
and
then
you
exclude
it
from
those
who
voted
democratic
and
republican
primaries
or
you
cut
so
far
down
and
you
don’t
know
who
to
go
to,
you
have
to
go
from
house
to
house
and
may
have
voted.
they
say,
“i
would
sign
but
i
voted
already.”
so
it’s
lots
of
handicaps
and
avoidance
that
you
have
to
undergo
in
order
to
try
and
qualify.
of
course
it
is
not
even
impossible,
that
if
i
have
been
able
to
have
foreseen
the
many
months
of
work
that
i’ll
have
to
undergo
to
get
here.
i
believe
i
will
wait
for
90
days
to
have
made
it.
and
i
think
i
will
say,
“you
should
die.”[laughter]
however,
i
am
hoping
that
my
appearance
here
will
serve
to
make
the
court
aware
of
the
problems
of
an
independent
candidate
in
that
--
an
independent
candidate
is
striving
to
help
to
make
--
help
make
the
county
stronger
and
--
well,
an
independent
candidate
goes
out
for
a
smaller
office.
he
does
not
expect
the
real
great
influence.
it’s
just
the
matter
of
trying
the
champion
somehow
the
government
that
he
has
and
if
he
admits
with
the
approval
of
the
people,
and
he
is
able
to
get
elected,
fine.
of
course,
an
independent
candidate
gets
on
the
joint
election
ballot.
he
still
has
the
democratic
party
and
the
republican
party
to
defeat
and
he
is
strictly
underdog.
he’s
got
a
hard
fight
on
his
hands
and
he
gets
no
funding
and
no
financing
like
the
democratic
party
does.
it’s
all
coming
out
of
his
pocket.
in
latter
times,
the
democratic
party
candidate
or
republican
party
candidate
don’t
have
any
opposition.
once
they
get
good
nomination,
which
in
many
cases
tantamount
to
election,
where
they
are
in.
you
don’t
have
any
joint
election
opposition.
so
all
they
have
to
do
is
struggle
to
get
on
the
primary
ballot
as
the
nominee
and
then
they
are
just
about
in.
but
lots
of
times
the
--
they
may
have
an
opposition
candidate
in
the
primary
and
none
in
the
joint
election
and
then
they
may
not
have
even
a
opposing
candidate
in
the
primary.
sometimes
it’s
just
a
show
hand
and
of
course
it
all
depends
upon
what
the
office
is
that
the
candidate
is
running
for.
now
i
hope
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
a
rebuttal
if
i
may.
i
don’t
know
what
i’ve
gone
over
it
or
not.
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
a
few
points
that
i
would
like
to
attempt
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court.
one,
after
the
case
of
bullock
versus
carter
that
party
primary
filing
fees
were
lowered
in
the
case
of
state
representative
to
the
sum
of
$200.00.
the
ultimate
nominating
petition
provided
that
2%
of
the
vote
cast
for
governor
of
the
party
in
the
last
preceding
general
election
would
be
sufficient
in
that
area
for
the
person
to
get
on
the
party
primary
balloting.
and
it
should
be
at
least
25
signatures
but
not
to
exceed
300.
i
would
like
to
make
this
distinction
that
the
5%
of
the
persons
who
voted
in
the
area
applies
in
the
article
13.50
to
all
who
cast
a
vote
for
governor
in
the
last
preceding
general
election.
you
may
have
a
democratic
and
republican
running
or
some
other
candidate
under
another
name
but
you
add
all
of
those
in
together
to
get
the
5%
in
that
particular
area
or
district
whereas
the
party
--
primary
nominee
only
has
to
get
5%
of
the
--
no
not
5%,
only
2%
of
the
total
number
of
votes
cast
for
the
governor
of
his
party.
so
it’s
maybe
down
the
25
and
it
maybe
but
it’s
not
to
exceed
300.
and
if
the
major
party
back
to
republican
court
in
texas,
if
that
candidate
for
governor
in
this
district
only
gets
1000
votes,
2%
of
that
would
be
about
20
and
that
would
put
him
in
the
primary.
now,
with
respect
to
notarization
under
the
old
law
with
respect
to
party
primary
candidates,
that
was
nothing
said
in
it
about
notarization.
so
i
presume
that
they
could
have
that
petition
signed
without
having
it
notarized.
is
all
--
they
also
provide
it
that
they
had
90
days
to
get
those
signatures
to
party
primary
candidate
but
the
independent
candidate
on
article
13.50
only
has
30
days.
now,
the
honorable
attorney
general
mr.
hill
was
talking
about
both
minor
party
--
minor
parties
and
independent
candidates
and
there
is
some
distinction
between
those
two.
now
an
independent
candidate
in
order
to
get
on
the
ballot
has
to
have
5%
of
the
votes
cast
in
that
area
or
district
for
that
particular
office
whereas
the
minor
party
candidate
only
has
to
get
1%
only
1%
of
a
vote
cast
either
for
a
general
--
for
governors
throughout
the
state
or
for
whatever.
but
he
is
only
has
to
get
1%.
now
the
independent
candidate
only
had
to
get
1%,
that
would
be
just
fine
but
they
have
made
it
5%
and
when
you
add
in
30
days
limitation
and
notarization.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
too
large
of
burden
placed
upon
the
independent
candidate.
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
the
independent
candidate
has
to
get
500.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
well
now,
it’s
likely
as
you
suppose
to
get
either
5%
--
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
or
500
then
you
can
take
the
less
--
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
never
have
to
get
more
than
500.
however,
the
5%
may
be
more
than
500.
mr.
robert
w.
hainsworth
not
in
every
case,
yes
sir.
equal
protection
of
the
laws
for
independent
candidates,
i
respectfully
submit
to
the
court
that
the
opinion
of
a
three-judge
district
court
in
hainsworth
versus
bullock
and
hainsworth
versus
white
before
this
court
be
reversed
on
the
grounds
that
the
requirements
under
article
13.50
are
so
strict
and
burdensome
that
there
is
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
section
1
of
united
states
constitution
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws
and
that
there
is
no
compelling
state
interest
involved
in
this
situation
or
in
this
case
which
requires
the
state
of
texas
to
have
this
particular
article
13.50
with
respect
to
an
independent
candidate
getting
on
the
ballot.
thank
you.
