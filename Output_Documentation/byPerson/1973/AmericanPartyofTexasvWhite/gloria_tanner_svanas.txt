representing
the
appellants
in
this
case,
the
minority
parties
from
texas,
the
american
party
of
texas,
the
socialist
workers
party
of
texas,
and
the
texas
new
party.
also,
representing
the
independent
candidate
laurel
dunn,
who
was
a
candidate
for
the
united
states
congress.
this
is
direct
appeal
from
a
three-judge
federal
court
in
the
western
district
of
texas
finding
certain
sections
of
the
texas
election
code
to
be
constitutional.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
appellants,
these
minority
parties
that
the
texas
election
code
is
precisely
drawn
to
accomplish
the
goal
that
--
what
is
intended
to
accomplish.
that
is
the
purposeful
and
invidious
discriminate
against
--
pardon
me,
discrimination
against
minor
parties
and
independent
candidates.
the
legislature
in
texas
arbitrarily
and
capriciously
controls
elections
in
texas.
it
has
been
said
that
there
are
four
alternative
routes
to
ballot
position
in
texas.
it
is
urged
by
the
appellants
that
they’re
rather
--
there
are
four
exclusionary
routes
from
the
ballot
in
texas.
the
first
exclusion
is
based
on
a
difference
of
opinion
with
political
philosophy.
you
either
join
up
with
the
republican
and
democrat
parties
in
texas
or
you
are
actually
excluded,
practically
excluded
from
the
ballot.
you
either
adopt
the
political
philosophy
of
the
two
major
parties
or
you
surrender
your
first
amendment
freedoms
which
allow
you
to
practice
the
philosophy
which
you
believe
and
to
associate
and
organize
political
parties
for
that
purpose.
once
you
have
participated
in
the
party
primary,
you
are
locked
in
to
that
particular
party.
actually,
voting
in
a
party
primary
constitutes
registration
in
the
state
of
texas.
not
only
from
the
standpoint
of
our
continuous
registration
which
we
now
have
but
also
from
party
affiliation.
only
through
participation
in
the
major
political
parties
are
you
allowed
the
privilege
of
absentee
voting.
otherwise,
you
are
completely
excluded
from
absentee
voting
and
if
you
should
desire
to
go
fishing
on
election
day
or
should
you
by
any
other
reason
be
prevented
from
participating
at
the
ballot
box,
you
will
go
to
the
county
clerks
office
in
texas
and
be
compelled
to
either
vote
republican
or
democrat
of
forfeit
your
right
to
vote.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
no,
sir.
i
have
not
found
one.
i
found
one
particular
case
this
court
had
decided
in
mcdonald
from
the
illinois
case
but
that
--
in
that
one,
the
absentee
privilege
is
restricted
to
those
who
were
confined
in
institutions
even
though
they
might
just
have
been
under
charges
and
have
not
been
convicted.
i
find
it
little
bit
harsh
to
compare
the
minority
parties
in
texas
to
the
inmates
of
penal
institutions
in
other
states.
the
added
bonus
which
we
have
in
texas
since
the
1971
mckool-stroud
primary
financing
law
which
is
also
part
of
this
appeal
is
the
fact
that
if
you
participate
in
the
republican
and
the
democrat
primary,
you
get
the
bonus
of
having
a
tax
paid
for
a
primary.
if
on
contrast
if
you
should
determine
to
participate
with
one
of
the
minority
parties,
then
you
are
compelled
to
pay
all
of
these
expenses
out
of
the
minority
party
account.
there
are
no
write-ins
in
the
primaries
in
texas
since
the
original
time
of
the
rise
of
the
republican
party
in
texas
which
used
to
nominate
by
write-ins
in
the
primary
so
they
exclude
the
write-ins
from
primaries
when
that
party
started
growing
up.
actually,
the
nomination
for
local
offices
in
texas
by
the
democrat
primary
as
a
practical
exercise
is
determity
participation
because
nomination
for
most
offices
in
texas
by
the
democrat
primary
is
tantamount
to
election.
the
second
exclusion
from
the
ballot
in
texas
is
by
the
numbers
of
the
votes
for
governor
which
were
cast
for
the
candidate
of
that
particular
political
party
in
the
last
gubernatorial
or
general
election.
for
instance
the
american
party
on
1968
hold
584,000
votes
for
its
nominee
for
united
states
president
but
because
the
american
party
did
not
have
a
nominee
on
the
ballot
for
governor,
it
was
automatically
excluded
from
the
ballot
from
that
time.
the
question
is,
is
the
numbers
of
vote
gained
insofar
as
the
gubernatorial
candidate
concern,
a
fairer
competition
and
thus,
that
fairer
competition
constitute
a
compelling
state
interest.
we
need
not
speculate
what
might
have
happened
to
our
requirement
for
votes
because
of
what
actually
did
happen
in
texas
after
the
la
raza
unida
candidate
secured
the
necessary
signatures
and
attained
ballot
position
in
the
1972
primary.
they
polled
more
than
2%
of
their
vote
for
their
gubernatorial
candidate
in
1972
and
consequently
they
--
the
texas
legislature
in
meeting
in
its
next
biennial
session
raised
the
quota
from
2%
to
20%
for
automatic
ballot
position
from
this
date.
and
so
the
numbers
gained
does
prevail
in
texas
and
if
one
minority
party
happens
to
fulfill
the
requirements
of
that
then
law,
then
they’ll
change
the
law
again.
and
actually,
that
was
the
difference
that
was
made
in
the
law
in
this
1345
subdivision
(2)
after
the
1968
campaign.
when
the
american
party
started
to
where
it
said
there
is
a
competitive
factor
in
texas
and
so
the
law
was
changed
and
so
we
got
this
honors
petitions
which
we
are
now
required
to
circulate.
this
is
the
basis
of
the
third
exclusion
from
the
ballot
in
texas.
if
the
gubernatorial
candidate
did
not
receive
2%
of
the
vote
which
is
now
been
raised
to
20%
of
the
vote
in
the
last
general
election,
you
have
to
go
out
and
start
the
petition
route
again.
of
course,
this
presumes
that
you
had
a
gubernatorial
candidate,
it
would
also
include
new
parties
like
the
texas
new
party
and
the
texas
socialist
workers
party
which
did
not
have
a
candidate
on
the
ballot
of
any
kind
in
1970
and
was
not
organized
on
a
statewide
basis.
we
have
a
statutorily
dictated
statewide
organization
in
texas
for
new,
the
minority
political
parties.
early
as
november
preceding
the
general
election,
we
are
required
to
file
a
notice
of
intent
to
nominate
by
a
convention.
in
january,
all
candidates
must
file
for
office
on
that
ballot.
by
march,
the
state
rules
must
be
filed.
in
may,
the
county
precinct
conventions
must
be
held
at
the
same
time
as
the
party
primary
conventions
are
being
held
and
suddenly
the
whole
texas
totalitarian
idea
takes
on
the
very
reflections
of
williams
versus
rhodes.
the
petitions
which
are
required
in
texas
are
statutorily
dictated
and
exacting
in
wording.
the
wording
must
be
exactly
as
it
is
dictated
by
statute
or
they
are
not
accepted
and
filed
by
the
secretary
of
state.
the
form
is
dictated,
the
form
of
the
signature.
prior
to
the
holding
of
the
precinct
conventions
through
out
the
254
counties
in
texas
in
may,
there
must
be
printed
and
circulated
these
petitions.
this
is
the
first
step
for
qualification
for
ballot
position
by
the
numbers
gained
in
texas.
they
must
be
circulated,
they
must
be
in
the
hands
of
this
precinct
chairman
in
each
of
the
precincts
so
they
will
be
available
for
signature
on
that
day
because
beginning
as
of
that
day,
you
have
a
total
of
54
days
as
in
1972,
it
might
be
55
days
next
year
to
secure
1%
of
the
total
vote
for
governor
in
the
proceeding
general
election
to
sign
this
petitions
to
indicate
the
support
for
some
candidate
who
might
be
running
on
this
minority
party
ticket.
this
number
in
1972
with
some
22,000
plus
signatures
in
1974
will
be
36,000
plus
signatures.
but
these
petitions
is
not
only
must
be
in
this
exact
form
but
they
must
be
signed
before
a
notary
public
and
they
carry
a
criminal
penalty
that
you
must
have
--
you
must
swear
that
you
have
not
participated
in
any
of
the
other
party
primaries
in
anyway
whatsoever.
you
have
already
been
excluded
from
the
absentee
balloting
and
it
is
the
contention
of
the
minority
parties
hereon
appeal
that
certainly
if
you
are
to
put
out
a
petition
after
the
primary,
we
should
also
be
accorded
the
right
to
compete
for
those
absentee
votes
and
there
are
many
thousands
of
absentee
votes
cast
in
texas
in
each
election.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
yes,
sir.
it
was.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
yes,
sir.
it
was.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
he
--
we
were
on
the
ballot
from
the
standpoint
only
of
the
presidential
candidate.
yes,
sir.
but
see,
after
the
1968
election
when
the
american
party
did
hold
584,000
votes
--
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
yes
sir,
for
the
presidential
candidate.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
that’s
right.
but
not
only
at
that
time
it
was
a
very
simple
matter,
1345
subdivision
(2)
was
changed
in
1969
to
meet
that
competitive
threat
of
1968
to
assure
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
make
the
ballot
in
1970
and
1972
and
that’s
where
we
came
up
with
our
petition
requirement
in
texas.
but
in
1968,
it
was
a
simple
matter
by
comparison
for
a
minority
party
to
get
on
the
ballot
and
that
was
the
method
that
was
followed
by
the
american
party
to
secure
ballot’s
position.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
yes
sir,
it
has
been
changed.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
much
more
difficult
sir
and
actually
the
legislature
in
texas
meets
every
two
years
and
it
seems
that
the
election
code
changes
every
two
years
to
meet
the
threat
of
the
minority
party
or
the
independent
or
the
competing
party
just
as
the
changes
been
made.
now
the
1972
mckool-stroud
act
for
the
purpose
of
state
financing
of
party
primaries
was
a
one
year
statute
and
it
was
thought
that
the
1972
legislature
would
change
the
elections
laws
to
provide
for
the
whole
new
primary
elections
procedure
but
since
they
did
not
do
so,
they
did
have
to
pass
another
financing
bill
which
is
the
senate
bill
11
which
has
been
filed
by
the
american
parties
in
supplemental
appendix
and
they
provided
in
that
apparently
to
pay
for
the
major
party
primaries
in
1974.
but
it
just
happened
to
incidentally
changed
1345
subdivision
(2)
again
to
require
that
to
maintain
ballot
position
after
1974
that
the
party
would
have
to
poll
20%
of
the
votes
for
governor.
of
course
it’s
foreseeable
that
this
could
result
in
active
campaigning
by
those
who
are
now
on
the
ballot
to
the
point
that
some
one
of
the
three
might
even
be
excluded.
the
fourth
exclusion
from
the
ballot
is
probably
what
is
recognized
in
texas
as
the
least
competition
to
the
major
parties
and
that
is
the
exclusion
of
the
independence
and
the
nonpartisan
candidates.
it
is
the
contention
of
mr.
laurel
dunn
who
was
the
candidate
for
united
states
congress
that
the
requirement
of
the
petition
in
addition
to
the
united
states
constitutional
specified
qualifications
for
united
states
congress
is
actually
the
super
added
idea.
the
petitions
are
super
added
to
the
qualifications
as
was
distinguished
by
the
candidate's
commentaries
on
constitutional
law.
this
of
course
is
the
powell
versus
mccormack
suit
which
earlier
had
been
decided
as
to
powell’s
additional
qualifications
or
the
attempt
to
exclude
him
from
the
house
of
representatives.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
appellants
that
the
statutory
exclusions
from
the
ballot
in
texas
result
in
constitutional
unjustifiable
equity
--
inequities.
we
don’t
believe
that
there
is
anything
in
the
record
whatsoever
by
which
the
state
of
texas
even
attempts
to
justify
these
exclusions.
whereas
the
compelling
state
interest
for
the
deviation
from
these
constitutional
guarantees
that
any
voter
can
effectively
participate
in
the
election
for
the
candidate
of
it
--
his
choice
as
compared
to
being
compelled
to
participate
in
either
the
--
of
the
two
major
parties.
the
size
of
the
ballot
falls
on
their
fears
when
we
realize
the
numbers
of
the
candidates
who
each
year
file
in
the
republican
and
democrat
primaries
for
the
office
of
the
governor
and
the
other
controlling
offices
in
texas.
this
is
particularly
true
since
this
court
has
overturned
the
filing
fees
requirement
in
the
state
of
texas.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
yes,
sir.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
yes,
sir.
it
is
not
required
to
be
held
but
if
we
are
to
secure
the
signatures
as
are
required
then
the
ballots
--
the
petitions,
pardon
me,
must
be
distributed
to
each
of
these
precincts
and
be
going
at
that
level.
they
--
the
requirement
becomes
more
obvious
if
one
desires
to
participate
in
the
primary
and
that
the
attendance
at
the
county
convention
is
limited
to
those
who
attended
the
precinct
convention
not
to
those
who
have
signed
the
petition
and
then
the
appendance
of
the
state
convention
which
nominates
on
the
statewide
level
is
limited
to
those
who
attended
the
county
convention
which
of
course
has
been
limited
by
the
precinct.
so
actually,
to
have
any
voice
in
the
minor
political
party
in
texas,
it
is
necessary
that
you
attend
the
precinct
convention
and
make
your
voice
heard
there
so
you
can
attend
on
up
the
role.
and
it’s
these
continuous
requirements
by
a
statute
of
what
we
must
do
that
makes
it
practically
impossible
to
attain
ballot
position
in
texas.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
it
does
not
disqualify
the
party
but
it
does
disqualify
the
individual
because
if
his
lack
of
participation,
there
is
no
way
for
him
to
go
back
and
become
a
participant
that
is
in
the
nomination
for
the
county
and
the
statewide
offices.
it
is
to
be
noted
from
the
record
that
the
republican
party
did
not
even
hold
party
primaries
in
every
county
in
texas
since
we
do
have
so
many
counties
and
some
of
them
don’t
indicate
any
interest
in
the
republican
party.
so
those
particular
persons,
if
they
did
not
participate
in
the
democrat
primary
and
there
was
no
offering
of
a
precinct
convention
by
the
american
party,
then
they
were
totally
without
a
vote
in
texas
in
1972.
thank
you.
ms.

that’s

that’s

they
will
determine
how
much
it
is
going
to
cost
them
to
hold
a
primary
in

county
in

and
they
will
report

amount
to

then
they
--
after

primary
has
been
held
in

primary
then
they
will
report
the
actual
amount
spent
and
based
on
the
actual
amount
spent,
each
county
chairman
in

is
liable
--
is
allowed
to
claim
a
5%
bonus
for

for

that
--
what
is
intended
to
accomplish.
that
is
the
purposeful
and
invidious
discriminate
against
--
pardon
me,
discrimination
against
minor
parties
and
independent
candidates.
the
legislature
in
texas
arbitrarily
and
capriciously
controls
elections
in
texas.
it
has
been
said
that
there
are
four
alternative
routes
to
ballot
position
in
texas.
it
is
urged
by
the
appellants
that
they’re
rather
--
there
are
four
exclusionary
routes
from
the
ballot
in
texas.
the
first
exclusion
is
based
on
a
difference
of
opinion
with
political
philosophy.
you
either
join
up
with
the
republican
and
democrat
parties
in
texas
or
you
are
actually
excluded,
practically
excluded
from
the
ballot.
you
either
adopt
the
political
philosophy
of
the
two
major
parties
or
you
surrender
your
first
amendment
freedoms
which
allow
you
to
practice
the
philosophy
which
you
believe
and
to
associate
and
organize
political
parties
for
that
purpose.
once
you
have
participated
in
the
party
primary,
you
are
locked
in
to
that
particular
party.
actually,
voting
in
a
party
primary
constitutes
registration
in
the
state
of
texas.
not
only
from
the
standpoint
of
our
continuous
registration
which
we
now
have
but
also
from
party
affiliation.
only
through
participation
in
the
major
political
parties
are
you
allowed
the
privilege
of
absentee
voting.
otherwise,
you
are
completely
excluded
from
absentee
voting
and
if
you
should
desire
to
go
fishing
on
election
day
or
should
you
by
any
other
reason
be
prevented
from
participating
at
the
ballot
box,
you
will
go
to
the
county
clerks
office
in
texas
and
be
compelled
to
either
vote
republican
or
democrat
of
forfeit
your
right
to
vote.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
no,
sir.
i
have
not
found
one.
i
found
one
particular
case
this
court
had
decided
in
mcdonald
from
the
illinois
case
but
that
--
in
that
one,
the
absentee
privilege
is
restricted
to
those
who
were
confined
in
institutions
even
though
they
might
just
have
been
under
charges
and
have
not
been
convicted.
i
find
it
little
bit
harsh
to
compare
the
minority
parties
in
texas
to
the
inmates
of
penal
institutions
in
other
states.
the
added
bonus
which
we
have
in
texas
since
the
1971
mckool-stroud
primary
financing
law
which
is
also
part
of
this
appeal
is
the
fact
that
if
you
participate
in
the
republican
and
the
democrat
primary,
you
get
the
bonus
of
having
a
tax
paid
for
a
primary.
if
on
contrast
if
you
should
determine
to
participate
with
one
of
the
minority
parties,
then
you
are
compelled
to
pay
all
of
these
expenses
out
of
the
minority
party
account.
there
are
no
write-ins
in
the
primaries
in
texas
since
the
original
time
of
the
rise
of
the
republican
party
in
texas
which
used
to
nominate
by
write-ins
in
the
primary
so
they
exclude
the
write-ins
from
primaries
when
that
party
started
growing
up.
actually,
the
nomination
for
local
offices
in
texas
by
the
democrat
primary
as
a
practical
exercise
is
determity
participation
because
nomination
for
most
offices
in
texas
by
the
democrat
primary
is
tantamount
to
election.
the
second
exclusion
from
the
ballot
in
texas
is
by
the
numbers
of
the
votes
for
governor
which
were
cast
for
the
candidate
of
that
particular
political
party
in
the
last
gubernatorial
or
general
election.
for
instance
the
american
party
on
1968
hold
584,000
votes
for
its
nominee
for
united
states
president
but
because
the
american
party
did
not
have
a
nominee
on
the
ballot
for
governor,
it
was
automatically
excluded
from
the
ballot
from
that
time.
the
question
is,
is
the
numbers
of
vote
gained
insofar
as
the
gubernatorial
candidate
concern,
a
fairer
competition
and
thus,
that
fairer
competition
constitute
a
compelling
state
interest.
we
need
not
speculate
what
might
have
happened
to
our
requirement
for
votes
because
of
what
actually
did
happen
in
texas
after
the
la
raza
unida
candidate
secured
the
necessary
signatures
and
attained
ballot
position
in
the
1972
primary.
they
polled
more
than
2%
of
their
vote
for
their
gubernatorial
candidate
in
1972
and
consequently
they
--
the
texas
legislature
in
meeting
in
its
next
biennial
session
raised
the
quota
from
2%
to
20%
for
automatic
ballot
position
from
this
date.
and
so
the
numbers
gained
does
prevail
in
texas
and
if
one
minority
party
happens
to
fulfill
the
requirements
of
that
then
law,
then
they’ll
change
the
law
again.
and
actually,
that
was
the
difference
that
was
made
in
the
law
in
this
1345
subdivision
(2)
after
the
1968
campaign.
when
the
american
party
started
to
where
it
said
there
is
a
competitive
factor
in
texas
and
so
the
law
was
changed
and
so
we
got
this
honors
petitions
which
we
are
now
required
to
circulate.
this
is
the
basis
of
the
third
exclusion
from
the
ballot
in
texas.
if
the
gubernatorial
candidate
did
not
receive
2%
of
the
vote
which
is
now
been
raised
to
20%
of
the
vote
in
the
last
general
election,
you
have
to
go
out
and
start
the
petition
route
again.
of
course,
this
presumes
that
you
had
a
gubernatorial
candidate,
it
would
also
include
new
parties
like
the
texas
new
party
and
the
texas
socialist
workers
party
which
did
not
have
a
candidate
on
the
ballot
of
any
kind
in
1970
and
was
not
organized
on
a
statewide
basis.
we
have
a
statutorily
dictated
statewide
organization
in
texas
for
new,
the
minority
political
parties.
early
as
november
preceding
the
general
election,
we
are
required
to
file
a
notice
of
intent
to
nominate
by
a
convention.
in
january,
all
candidates
must
file
for
office
on
that
ballot.
by
march,
the
state
rules
must
be
filed.
in
may,
the
county
precinct
conventions
must
be
held
at
the
same
time
as
the
party
primary
conventions
are
being
held
and
suddenly
the
whole
texas
totalitarian
idea
takes
on
the
very
reflections
of
williams
versus
rhodes.
the
petitions
which
are
required
in
texas
are
statutorily
dictated
and
exacting
in
wording.
the
wording
must
be
exactly
as
it
is
dictated
by
statute
or
they
are
not
accepted
and
filed
by
the
secretary
of
state.
the
form
is
dictated,
the
form
of
the
signature.
prior
to
the
holding
of
the
precinct
conventions
through
out
the
254
counties
in
texas
in
may,
there
must
be
printed
and
circulated
these
petitions.
this
is
the
first
step
for
qualification
for
ballot
position
by
the
numbers
gained
in
texas.
they
must
be
circulated,
they
must
be
in
the
hands
of
this
precinct
chairman
in
each
of
the
precincts
so
they
will
be
available
for
signature
on
that
day
because
beginning
as
of
that
day,
you
have
a
total
of
54
days
as
in
1972,
it
might
be
55
days
next
year
to
secure
1%
of
the
total
vote
for
governor
in
the
proceeding
general
election
to
sign
this
petitions
to
indicate
the
support
for
some
candidate
who
might
be
running
on
this
minority
party
ticket.
this
number
in
1972
with
some
22,000
plus
signatures
in
1974
will
be
36,000
plus
signatures.
but
these
petitions
is
not
only
must
be
in
this
exact
form
but
they
must
be
signed
before
a
notary
public
and
they
carry
a
criminal
penalty
that
you
must
have
--
you
must
swear
that
you
have
not
participated
in
any
of
the
other
party
primaries
in
anyway
whatsoever.
you
have
already
been
excluded
from
the
absentee
balloting
and
it
is
the
contention
of
the
minority
parties
hereon
appeal
that
certainly
if
you
are
to
put
out
a
petition
after
the
primary,
we
should
also
be
accorded
the
right
to
compete
for
those
absentee
votes
and
there
are
many
thousands
of
absentee
votes
cast
in
texas
in
each
election.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
yes,
sir.
it
was.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
yes,
sir.
it
was.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
he
--
we
were
on
the
ballot
from
the
standpoint
only
of
the
presidential
candidate.
yes,
sir.
but
see,
after
the
1968
election
when
the
american
party
did
hold
584,000
votes
--
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
yes
sir,
for
the
presidential
candidate.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
that’s
right.
but
not
only
at
that
time
it
was
a
very
simple
matter,
1345
subdivision
(2)
was
changed
in
1969
to
meet
that
competitive
threat
of
1968
to
assure
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
make
the
ballot
in
1970
and
1972
and
that’s
where
we
came
up
with
our
petition
requirement
in
texas.
but
in
1968,
it
was
a
simple
matter
by
comparison
for
a
minority
party
to
get
on
the
ballot
and
that
was
the
method
that
was
followed
by
the
american
party
to
secure
ballot’s
position.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
yes
sir,
it
has
been
changed.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
much
more
difficult
sir
and
actually
the
legislature
in
texas
meets
every
two
years
and
it
seems
that
the
election
code
changes
every
two
years
to
meet
the
threat
of
the
minority
party
or
the
independent
or
the
competing
party
just
as
the
changes
been
made.
now
the
1972
mckool-stroud
act
for
the
purpose
of
state
financing
of
party
primaries
was
a
one
year
statute
and
it
was
thought
that
the
1972
legislature
would
change
the
elections
laws
to
provide
for
the
whole
new
primary
elections
procedure
but
since
they
did
not
do
so,
they
did
have
to
pass
another
financing
bill
which
is
the
senate
bill
11
which
has
been
filed
by
the
american
parties
in
supplemental
appendix
and
they
provided
in
that
apparently
to
pay
for
the
major
party
primaries
in
1974.
but
it
just
happened
to
incidentally
changed
1345
subdivision
(2)
again
to
require
that
to
maintain
ballot
position
after
1974
that
the
party
would
have
to
poll
20%
of
the
votes
for
governor.
of
course
it’s
foreseeable
that
this
could
result
in
active
campaigning
by
those
who
are
now
on
the
ballot
to
the
point
that
some
one
of
the
three
might
even
be
excluded.
the
fourth
exclusion
from
the
ballot
is
probably
what
is
recognized
in
texas
as
the
least
competition
to
the
major
parties
and
that
is
the
exclusion
of
the
independence
and
the
nonpartisan
candidates.
it
is
the
contention
of
mr.
laurel
dunn
who
was
the
candidate
for
united
states
congress
that
the
requirement
of
the
petition
in
addition
to
the
united
states
constitutional
specified
qualifications
for
united
states
congress
is
actually
the
super
added
idea.
the
petitions
are
super
added
to
the
qualifications
as
was
distinguished
by
the
candidate's
commentaries
on
constitutional
law.
this
of
course
is
the
powell
versus
mccormack
suit
which
earlier
had
been
decided
as
to
powell’s
additional
qualifications
or
the
attempt
to
exclude
him
from
the
house
of
representatives.
it
is
the
contention
of
the
appellants
that
the
statutory
exclusions
from
the
ballot
in
texas
result
in
constitutional
unjustifiable
equity
--
inequities.
we
don’t
believe
that
there
is
anything
in
the
record
whatsoever
by
which
the
state
of
texas
even
attempts
to
justify
these
exclusions.
whereas
the
compelling
state
interest
for
the
deviation
from
these
constitutional
guarantees
that
any
voter
can
effectively
participate
in
the
election
for
the
candidate
of
it
--
his
choice
as
compared
to
being
compelled
to
participate
in
either
the
--
of
the
two
major
parties.
the
size
of
the
ballot
falls
on
their
fears
when
we
realize
the
numbers
of
the
candidates
who
each
year
file
in
the
republican
and
democrat
primaries
for
the
office
of
the
governor
and
the
other
controlling
offices
in
texas.
this
is
particularly
true
since
this
court
has
overturned
the
filing
fees
requirement
in
the
state
of
texas.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
yes,
sir.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
yes,
sir.
it
is
not
required
to
be
held
but
if
we
are
to
secure
the
signatures
as
are
required
then
the
ballots
--
the
petitions,
pardon
me,
must
be
distributed
to
each
of
these
precincts
and
be
going
at
that
level.
they
--
the
requirement
becomes
more
obvious
if
one
desires
to
participate
in
the
primary
and
that
the
attendance
at
the
county
convention
is
limited
to
those
who
attended
the
precinct
convention
not
to
those
who
have
signed
the
petition
and
then
the
appendance
of
the
state
convention
which
nominates
on
the
statewide
level
is
limited
to
those
who
attended
the
county
convention
which
of
course
has
been
limited
by
the
precinct.
so
actually,
to
have
any
voice
in
the
minor
political
party
in
texas,
it
is
necessary
that
you
attend
the
precinct
convention
and
make
your
voice
heard
there
so
you
can
attend
on
up
the
role.
and
it’s
these
continuous
requirements
by
a
statute
of
what
we
must
do
that
makes
it
practically
impossible
to
attain
ballot
position
in
texas.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
it
does
not
disqualify
the
party
but
it
does
disqualify
the
individual
because
if
his
lack
of
participation,
there
is
no
way
for
him
to
go
back
and
become
a
participant
that
is
in
the
nomination
for
the
county
and
the
statewide
offices.
it
is
to
be
noted
from
the
record
that
the
republican
party
did
not
even
hold
party
primaries
in
every
county
in
texas
since
we
do
have
so
many
counties
and
some
of
them
don’t
indicate
any
interest
in
the
republican
party.
so
those
particular
persons,
if
they
did
not
participate
in
the
democrat
primary
and
there
was
no
offering
of
a
precinct
convention
by
the
american
party,
then
they
were
totally
without
a
vote
in
texas
in
1972.
thank
you.
ms.
gloria
tanner
svanas
that’s
the
county
--
that’s
the
party
county
chairman,
mr.
justice.
the
state
law
in
texas
provides
under
the
mckool-stroud
act
and
under
the
new
recently
passed
primary
financing
law
that
the
county
chairman
of
the
major
political
parties
which
this
year
will
include
raza
unida
because
they
did
qualify
by
the
2%
vote
in
1972.
they
will
determine
how
much
it
is
going
to
cost
them
to
hold
a
primary
in
each
county
in
texas
and
they
will
report
that
amount
to
the
secretary
of
state
then
they
--
after
the
primary
has
been
held
in
the
runoff
primary
then
they
will
report
the
actual
amount
spent
and
based
on
the
actual
amount
spent,
each
county
chairman
in
texas
is
liable
--
is
allowed
to
claim
a
5%
bonus
for
himself
for
his
participation
in
the
major
party
primary.
