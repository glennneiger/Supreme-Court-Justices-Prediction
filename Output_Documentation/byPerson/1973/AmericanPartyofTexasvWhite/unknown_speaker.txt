do
you
know
of
any
other
state
that
has
such
a
provision
as
to
absentee
ballots
being
restricted
to
one
of
the
ballot?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
svanas,
you
referred
to
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
of
the
united
states
on
what
you’re
calling
minority
party,
was
that
the
american
party?
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
in
1968?
unknown
speaker
was
that
party
on
the
ballot
as
such?
unknown
speaker
for
your
presidential
candidate?
unknown
speaker
you
have
no
gubernatorial
candidate.
unknown
speaker
but
since
that
time
the
law
has
been
--
unknown
speaker
changed
and
made
more
--
making
it
more
difficult
for
(voice
overlap).
unknown
speaker
mrs.
svanas,
we
come
back
a
minute
to
the
party
conventions
which
you
mentioned.
i
think
as
i
recall
at
article
1547
states
that
party
convention
shall
be
held
in
precincts
county
and
the
state.
unknown
speaker
now,
did
that
construed
literally
to
require
that
a
precinct
convention
be
held
in
every
precinct
in
the
state
of
texas?
unknown
speaker
if
conventions
are
not
held
in
every
precinct
or
in
every
county,
does
that
disqualify
the
individual
or
the
party?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
svanas,
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question.
explain
to
me
this
5%
bonus
for
the
county
clerk
under
the
financing
law?
unknown
speaker
but
what’s
involved
in
getting
a
notarized
signature?
unknown
speaker
how
much,
how
much
it
cost?
unknown
speaker
and
what
formality
does
the
notary
public
have
to
follow?
unknown
speaker
does
notary
have
to
execute
any
formal
return?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
how
long
does
he
get
it?
unknown
speaker
or
its
substitutes?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
points
of
argue
there
were
--
they
were
strictly
limited
in
time?
unknown
speaker
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
or
if
you
can
supply
the
names
by
certifying
that
those
who
attend
your
--
unknown
speaker
or
55
days
between
them
and
the
election?
unknown
speaker
well,
you’ve
said
that.
now
go
on,
let’s
assume
they
don’t.
unknown
speaker
how
long
is
that?
unknown
speaker
alright,
55
days.
unknown
speaker
but
also
if
they
don’t
have
any
or
they
got
55
days
to
get
22
more?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
independent
candidate,
what
does
he
have
to
do?
unknown
speaker
i
beg
your
pardon,
about
24
to
25
days,
not
known
once
done?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
you’re
not
sure.
do
you?
unknown
speaker
how
many
signatures
mr.
attorney
general
does
an
independent
candidate
have?
unknown
speaker
is
this
to
say
it
depends
upon
what
office
he
candidates
would?
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
to
--
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
now,
how
did
you
certify
the
names
of
the
people
who
attended
your
convention?
unknown
speaker
and
does
those
all
have
to
be
notarized?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
but
if
people
attending
independent
parties
or
minority
parties’
convention
and
yet
disqualified
or
unqualified
from
--
to
sign
this
petitions?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
thought
they
only
had
to
get
500?
unknown
speaker
you
said
5%?
unknown
speaker
or
500?
unknown
speaker
so
you
never
have
to
get
more
than
500?
unknown
speaker
you
never
have
to
get
more
than
500?
unknown
speaker
yes.
so
you
really
don’t
have
to
get
5%
in
every
case?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
any
other
state
that
has
