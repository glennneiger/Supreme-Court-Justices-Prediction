in
72-887
and
72-942,
the
american
party
and
hainsworth
cases,
we
have
somewhat
similar
challenges
raised
to
the
provisions
of
the
election
code
in
texas.
this
time,
both
new
or
small
parties
are
involved
as
well
as
independent
candidates.
insofar,
as
the
provision
regulates
the
access
to
the
ballot
by
the
new
parties
and
independent
candidates,
we
affirm
the
judgment
below
which
sustained
the
statutes.
we
also
think
that
district
court
dealt
with
the
challenge
to
the
texas
campaign-financing
law
satisfactorily
and
that
court
sustained
it
and
we
affirm
in
that
respect.
but
the
texas
statutes
also
deny
the
benefits
of
the
absentee
ballot
to
new
or
minority
parties
and
in
this
respect,
we
think
the
judgment
below
should
be
vacated
before
further
proceedings
are
consistent
with
the
principle
stated
in
the
opinion
that
we
have
filed
today.
