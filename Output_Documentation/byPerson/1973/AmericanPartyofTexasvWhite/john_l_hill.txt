mr.
john
l.
hill
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
first
thank
mrs.
svanas
for
filing
an
appendix
with
this
honorable
court
in
which
she
very
promisingly
asked
that
the
governor
signs
senate
bill
11.
i
filed
that
as
an
appendix
with
the
court
saving
us
the
trouble
of
doing
this.
i
think
it
speaks
very
clearly
for
itself
and
we
have
not
elaborated
by
any
additional
brief
but
with
reference
to
it.
second
thing,
i
would
like
to
say
that
particularly,
after
listening
to
him
although
i
have
known
him
in
houston
that
our
texas
admires
independent
candidates
and
we
want
people
like
mr.
hainsworth
to
stand
if
they
desire
as
independent
candidates
and
i
think
our
laws
have
accordingly
allowed
that.
i
need
to
speak
if
i
might
for
a
moment
factually
to
the
american
party
situation.
this
party
of
course
with
a
very
valuable
political
force
in
1968
in
our
state
with
over
91,000
signed
up
members
and
they
cast
584,269
votes
for
george
wallace
for
president.
now
since
the
american
party
elect
did
not,
for
reasons
of
their
own,
to
fill
a
governor
nominee
in
the
1968
general
election.
that
party
in
1970
was
required
under
our
statute
to
nominate
candidates
for
state
and
local
offices
for
the
general
election
by
conventions
and
when
the
party
did
not
file
with
--
more
required
and
my
represent
i
set
the
state
sufficient
certification
to
indicate
the
minimum
support
that
our
statutes
covering
these
matters
contemplate
something
in
the
neighborhood
as
22,000
conventioneers
or
if
that
many
people
don’t
get
to
the
convention,
we
permit
supplementation
by
petition
which
we
regard
as
a
helping
hand
not
as
a
deterrent
and
add
on
in
addition.
for
reasons
that
i
frankly
don’t
know
and
i
understand
and
the
record
is
sailing
on
it.
they
just
simply
had
6,828
names.
whether
they
were
--
that
was
because
of
their
tremendous
and
the
court
can
take
judicial
knowledge
of
their
great
participation
in
the
democratic
party
are
not,
i
did
not
know,
but
those
are
the
facts.
now
the
new
party,
on
the
other
hand,
represents
truly
just
what
it
is,
a
new
party
at
texas
new
party
we
don’t
know
very
much
about
it,
we’re
not
told
very
much
about
it.
this
court
is
not
told
much
about
it.
made
no
effort
at
all
under
this
record
to
have
any
compliance
and
that’s
where
that
matter
stand.
the
socialist
workers
party
did
comply
with
our
laws
and
they
were
on
the
ballot
and
they’re
--
while
filing
a
brief
here,
are
not
here
at
least
verbalizing
that.
and
i
don’t
know
of
any
substantial
complaint
that
they
raised.
well,
as
for
unida
who
took
no
appeal
from
this
matter
and
we
are
part
--
we
are
state
of
many
minority
parties
today,
just
a
proof
for
the
putting.
we
have
a
very
fine
gentleman
for
a
governor,
he
received
a
very
good
vote
and
they
qualified
under
the
2%
and
i’ll
discuss
how
our
procedure
works
in
a
little
more
detail
in
a
moment.
and
then
mr.
ronald
dunn
who
was
an
independent
candidate
for
the
united
states
house
of
representatives
and
represents
himself
and
before
the
independent
candidate
made
absolutely
no
attempt
to
meet
the
requirements
of
our
statute
with
reference
to
independent
candidates
and
simply
filed
suit
shortly
after
the
primary
elections.
of
course
he
has
a
perfect
right
to
do.
mr.
hainsworth
did
try.
had
he
not
obtained
for
reasons
that
i
am
sure
the
court
has
heard
here
and
whether
that
represent
inability
of
what
we
can’t
judge,
it’s
a
peculiarly
within
probably
in
his
mind
but
nonetheless
his
328
fell
short
of
the
500
which
we
believe
is
not
an
owner’s
burden
and
one
that
many
has
met.
he
filed
a
suit
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
these
provisions
in
a
very
candid
and
open
way
that
he
had
displayed
here
before
the
court.
now,
we
were
faced
in
texas,
of
the
last
session
of
the
legislature.
with
this
situation
we
will
face
with
williams
as
we
could
read
it
and
understand
it.
and
we
will
face
with
jenness
as
best
we
could
read
it
and
understand
what
this
honorable
court,
we
are
saying
to
the
state
in
this
area.
we
had
read
rosario
versus
rockefeller.
but
we
had
here
three
cases
in
which
this
court,
the
majority
of
this
court
had
been
heavily
involved.
in
addition
to
that,
you
had
written
bullock
versus
carter
arising
from
our
state
involving
our
financing
situation
of
our
filing
fees.
if
i
might,
in
that
text
--
in
that
context,
discuss
with
you
for
a
moment
senate
bill
11
that’s
here
as
in
the
appendix
which
was
passed
and
signed
by
our
governor
in
june,
the
15th
of
this
year,
it
provides,
one,
a
schedule
of
filing
fees
that
we
believe
are
in
keeping
with
the
rules
of
reasonableness
permitted
at
bullock
versus
carter
much
less
than
before,
much
legislative.
not
here
under
attack
and
permitting
the
filing
of
a
candidate
of
a
nominating
petition
in
lieu
of
the
payment
of
filing
fees
which
we
believe
is
very
progressive
in
keeping
with
carter
versus
bullock
and
not
here
under
attack
provides
perspectives
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes,
sir
5,000
in
the
statewide
case,
yes
sir.
and
the
notarization
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
as
far
as
i
am
aware
is
not
been
under
attack
in
any
decision
of
which
i
am
familiar
and
the
only
decision
in
which
the
matter
has
been
discussed
was
not
thought
to
be
a
constitutional
burden.
mr.
john
l.
hill
and
moreover
from
my
--
pardon
me.
mr.
john
l.
hill
oh!
yes.
much,
much
you
see
under
jenness
versus
georgia
if
we
use
jenness
and
in
this
--
this
can
be
considered
by
state.
the
time
to
speak
by
a
legislature
but
5%
of
our
total
electorate
in
texas
and
that
is
jenness.
it’s
not
5%
of
a
gubernatorial
candidate;
it’s
5%
of
the
electorate.
i
don’t
know
what
mrs.
svanas
and
others
would
say
that
constitutes
as
of
the
time
relevant
to
this
case
something
over
200,000
signatures.
and
we
would
be
passed
in
clearer
constitutional
muster.
under
jenness
we
just
walked
in,
off
our
hats,
and
walk
out.
we
have
elected
not
in
any
effort
to
hold
down
minority
parties
but
we
have
elected
in
our
state
in
an
effort
to
have
a
totally
fair
system
in
one
that
we
believe
is
much
preferable
to
georgia
and
much
fairer
to
georgia
to
have
1%,
1%
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
of
gubernatorial,
it
would
be
about
22,000
under
our
--
in
other
words
we
lack
a
lot
of
other
states
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
white,
don’t
vote
our
folks.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no,
sir.
mr.
justice
marshall
on
the
note
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
well
sir,
the
practical
answer
to
that
and
i
realized
that
we
have
a
current
problem
here
as
far
as
when
you
get
into
question
as
well
and
cost,
i
am
not
unmindful
of
that.
but
the
facts
are
that
notarization
is
allowed
and
not
have
the
statute
opened
here
is
allowed
in
bulk
on
certification
for
one
thing.
it
says,
that
the
certifying
officer
may
certify
the
petition.
i
might
just
--
one
certificate
of
the
officer
with
whom
before
whom
the
oath
is
taken
may
be
still
made
to
supply
all
to
whom
it
was
administered.
the
candidate
can
be
a
notary.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
there
can’t
be
some
cost
here
but
it’s
an
exaggerated
point
in
my
own
judgment.
mr.
john
l.
hill
he
has
--
you
mean
in
terms
of
the
independent
candidate?
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
sir,
this
is
the
basic
way
we
work
mr.
justice
white
is
two
conventions
on
minority
party.
we
presume
that
the
convention
will
be
held
on
the
same
day
that
we
as
democrats
vote
and
as
republicans
vote
and
all
other
parties
that
the
conventions
will
be
held
and
as
a
result
to
the
convention
the
22,000
people
will
attend
and
certify
their
names.
you
don’t
even
get
into
petitions.
the
only
way
we
get
into
petitions
that
all
in
texas
is
we
alight
as
a
supplement
to
the
convention
process.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no
--
well
it
could
be
a
total
substitute
but
our
tax
is
frankly
are
written
to
where
it
is
implied
in
the
statute
that
you
will
try
to
have
convention.
now
for
example
the
socialist
worker
party
in
qualifying
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
they
have
55
days
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
if
--
well
let
me
get
--
it
has
to
get
this
exactly
because
the
socialist
worker
party
for
example
got
all
of
their
petitions
by
conventions
in
harris
county.
you
don’t
have
to
have
precinct
conventions
all
over
our
state.
in
fact
it
would
be
kind
of
ridiculous
to
try.
you’re
not
required
by
law
to
do
it.
you
can
have
the
conventions
wherever
you
elect
to
have
those
conventions.
when
you
go
to
your
conventions,
our
minority
party
and
only
one
in
our
state
there
are
minority
party
or
those
who
didn’t
pull
over
2%
of
the
gubernatorial
vote
in
the
preceding
general
election.
so
we
don’t
have
a
very
harsh
rule
of
threshold
to
begin
with
but
when
they
go
under
that
rule
and
they
come
to
this
convention
processes,
it’s
anticipated.
they
can
go
out
all
of
the
time
our
elections
are
going
on
and
say,
“don’t
vote
in
that
democratic
primary,
i
want
you
to
come
to
our
convention”
we
are
going
to
have
it
the
same
day.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no,
sir.
it
works
this
way.
in
early
may,
we
have
our
first
democratic
primary,
our
first
primary.
on
that
same
day,
minority
parties
who
are
under
the
2%,
our
last
rule,
have
their
conventions
anytime
from
seven
to
seven.
when
they
go
into
those
conventions,
if
they
produce
and
they
can
have
them
in
one
county,
50
counties,
30
counties,
wherever
they
want
to
have
them
where
they
think
they
have
support.
they
can
bring
this
--
the
voters
in
--
their
people
into
those
conventions.
they
could
have
all
ready
told
them
and
had
it
planned
ahead
of
time
that
that’s
what
we
are
going
to
do.
then
when
i
get
there,
if
they
have
22,000
roughly
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
all
right
then
they
have
an
extra
period
of
time
up
until
the
latter
part
of
june
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
which
is
55
days.
mr.
john
l.
hill
to
supplement
the
convention
signatures
if
they
don’t
have
quite
enough.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes,
sir.
if
nobody
shows
up
at
all.
mr.
john
l.
hill
independent
candidate,
he
of
course
files
along
the
time
that
everyone
else
does.
he
has
--
he
can
start
getting
his
petitions
signed
after
the
primary
which
would
be
in
may
and
he
must
turn
a
man
30
days
after
the
second
--
after
the
runoff.
i
guess
adding
that
up
if
you
could
help
me
i
would
say
it
is
something
if
you
started
right
after
may
you
are
looking
at
the
better
part
of
two
months.
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
if
you
would,
if
you
start
it
only
after
the
second
runoff,
the
second
runoff.
in
other
word
if
you
started
after
the
june
runoff
to
get
the
independent
candidate
signatures
you
would
be
restricted
if
you
want
to
exclude
somebody
to
something
in
the
neighborhood
in
25
days.
it’s
my
thought
about
it
that
there
is
nothing
in
that
statute.
once,
the
may
primary
is
held
to
prevent
the
independent
candidate
from
securing
signatures.
mr.
john
l.
hill
i’m
sorry.
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
l.
hill
they
can
get
the
petition
anytime
after
they
filed
for
their
--
announcing
their
candidacy,
they
file
like
every
other
candidate
does
back
in
february.
mr.
john
l.
hill
they
could
get
the
petition
and
i
don’t
--
but
the
last
thing
i
want
to
do
is
a
make
a
misstatement,
i
don’t
--
first
i
don’t
know
for
certain.
i
believe
the
facts
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
don’t
believe
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don’t
believe
that’s
correct.
i’m
not
sure
though
that
that
--
i
wouldn’t
think
the
case
would
in
anyways
depend
on
the
accuracy
of
–-
mr.
john
l.
hill
i’m
not
sure
sir.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
whether
he
had
the
petition
in
his
hand
in
february,
march
or
april
would
be
relatively
immaterial
because
he
can’t
get
anyone
to
sign
that
petition
until
after
the
primary
is
over.
unless
someone
wanted
to
say
categorically
ahead
of
time,
i’m
not
going
to
vote
in
the
democratic
or
republican
primary,
so
i
will
sign
your
petition
but
we
do
have
a
rule.
in
our
state
that
we
think
is
very
legitimate
and
very
necessary
that
does
prevent
those
who
sign
this
supplemental
petition
or
who
signed
the
petition
of
an
independent
candidate
not
to
vote
in
the
democratic
republican
la
raza
or
any
other
party
primary
that
we’re
holding
in
our
state.
mr.
john
l.
hill
the
same,
1%
of
the
vote
of
the
gubernatorial
candidates
and
the
preceding
general
election.
but
there
is
a
limitation
on
the
district
like
mr.
hainsworth,
i
believe
his
was
down
to
500
maximum,
500
maximum,
we
don’t
--
we
don’t
impose
that.
mr.
john
l.
hill
if
it’s
a
statewide
office,
it’s
more.
but
the
ones
before
this
court
are
all
one
for
congress
and
one
for
representative,
they
both
--
we
put
a
500
which
is
minimal.
if
you’re
going
to
have
a
system
of
elections
in
government
and
the
state
where
you
have
any
manner
or
way
to
not
discourage
the
independent
candidates,
not
to
discourage
the
minority
party
but
there
has
some
stability
to
have
some
ability
not
to
have
rating.
some
ability
not
to
have
candidates
come
in
to
your
primaries,
whatever
the
primary
is
and
try
to
vote
for
the
weakest
candidate
to
hurt
your
party
and
all
of
the
other
reasons
that
the
courts
have
approved
in
connection
with
anti-rating
provisions
or
provisions
to
show
minimal
support
so
that
you
don’t
have
total
chaos,
you
don’t
have
total
vote
of
confusion.
why
is
texas
here
to
defend
a
system
with
500
votes,
500
signatures?
i’d
be
the
last
to
want
to
just
defend
it
because
of
the
texas
statute
but
i
do
say
candidly
that
the
court,
this
is
--
this
we
have
500
in
connection
with
independent
candidate,
we
have
22,000
but
supplementary
petitions,
supplementary
petitions
in
our
state.
we
have
two
minority
parties
that
made
the
ballot.
we
have
the
other
party
here
complaining
that
all
548,000
votes
in
our
state
four
years
ago
and
can
turn
it
on
anytime
they
want
to
turn
it
on.
and
we
have
one
new
party
that
we
would
welcome
into
the
arena
of
good
ideas
and
new
ideas
because
they
do
that.
they
contribute
that
to
our
process.
clearly
they
do
and
that
is
why
we
have
a
constitutional
mandate
that
we’re
not
to
burden
them.
that
we’re
not
to
deprive
them
of
their
associational
rights,
we’re
not
to
burden
their
free
speech
and
we’re
to
accord
them
equal
protection.
but
nonetheless
the
courts
recognize
that
we
have
some
compelling
state
interest
and
when
we
show
that
there
is
a
necessity
for
what
we
do
and
that
it’s
reasonable
and
it
is
not
invidiously
discriminatory
and
not
intended
to
be.
in
fact
in
one,
i
honestly
say,
now
mrs.
svanas
in
all
fairness
describes
an
awful
lot
of
motives
to
an
awful
lot
of
thing
saying
but
those
are
words
and
she
is
free
to
express
them
but
constitutional
issues
can’t
be
decided
on
that
type
of
unsupported
rhetoric.
we
have
done
nothing
in
our
state
to
injure
her
party,
not
to
injure
other
parties.
we
don’t
meet
in
the
texas
legislature
just
to
revise
laws
for
that
purpose.
we
change
the
laws
in
our
state
in
1973
solely
because
we
were
trying
to
get
in
line
with
the
united
states
supreme
court
decisions
written
by
the
majority
of
the
just
to
cede
before
i
am
now
appearing
and
speaking
on
behalf
of
my
state.
we
wanted
to
comply
with
bullock
versus
carter.
that’s
precisely
why
justice
burger
you
told
us,
in
bullock
versus
carter
that
you
saw
when
we
suggest
it
that
if
we
went
to
a
state
financing
system
in
texas
we
might
run
in
to
some
problems
of
equal
protection
and
you
said
in
bullock
versus
carter
pointing
to
jenness,
pointing
to
jenness
but
have
the
cutoff
line
at
20%
for
parties
who
“should
take
on
the
burdens
of
primaries
and
under
20%
that
didn’t.”
so
we
changed
our
law
and
we
said,
alright,
everyone
that
pose
20%
can
come
in
under
state
primaries.
we
weren’t
trying
to
throttle
la
raza
unida.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
made
an
exception
for
it,
an
exception
for
them,
in
a
s.p.
11
so
they
could
have
an
option
this
year
as
to
whether
they
wanted
to
go
primary
or
convention
because
we
respect
it,
the
fact
that
they’d
earned
that
right
and
it
was
maintained.
but
now
we
are
faced
with
the
very
thing
that
we
were
trying
to
avoid
and
following
bullock
versus
carter
and
jenness
to
change
to
the
20%
and
allow
those
parties
to
have
state
financing
supplement
their
filing
fees.
we
have
a
convention
system
through.
if
georgia
to
be
accorded
constitutionality
because
she
elects
solely
to
valid
the
petition
system
which
has
five
--
ten
times
the
required
number
of
people
that
must
be
mustered.
for
gentleman
like
mr.
hainsworth
to
gain
the
ballot
as
opposed
to
the
texas
system
which
says
simply
conduct
conventions
on
election
day,
you
don’t
have
to
have
a
great
big
apparatus
like
was
required
in
ohio.
you
don’t
have
to
have
primary
elections.
you
don’t
have
to
send
delegates
to
the
nation
of
convention
as
they
did
in
williams
versus
rhodes.
all
we
ask
you
to
do
or
require
you
to
do
is
simply
to
have
conventions
in
counties
and
precincts
where
you
think
you
can
muster
some
support.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes,
sir
mr.
justice
white
and
if
we
were
to
have,
yes
sir
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
and
i
honestly
how
can
we
say
under
constitutional
principles
that
we
have
indeed
in
williams
and
jenness
and
rosario
of
the
majority
opinions
in
those
cases
and
the
compelling
state
interest
doctrine
a
necessity
that
that,
that
we
are
to
second
guess
that
kind
of
a
system
but
why?
22,000
signatures
gathered
together
to
convention
process
are
supplemented
if
--
if
you
had
a
minimal
--
we
are
to
require
some
minimal
degree
of
support
before
people
can.
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
simply
have
their
name
and
address
as
they
come
in
the
door.
they
sign
up
and
tell
who
they
are
and
where
they
live.
mr.
john
l.
hill
it
says
certified
and
delivered
to
the
secretary
state.
i
assume
that
the
state
chairman
or
county
chairman
or
precinct
chairman
would
certify
and
probably
notarize
them
but
it
doesn’t
matter,
it
doesn’t
matter,
it’s
not
a
very
relevant
point
in
my
opinion.
it
is
that
they
are
there
and
they
signed
up
and
the
--
after
it,
he
can
certify
the
whole
list
on
one
petition
under
one
notarization.
you
say
they’re
presumably
on
run
like
the
socialist
worker
party
has
one
big
meeting,
they
were
their.
they
turned
out,
they
signed
the
list
and
put
down
their
address
and
we
didn’t
challenge
one
of
them.
not
one
of
them,
they
were
sent
in,
they
had
enough
numbers
i
got
on
the
ballot.(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
certainly.
the
theory
only
is
--
only
disqualification
is
that
if
you
have
attended
the
democratic
or
republican
primary
and
voted.
but
we
did,
so
we
don’t
have
party
--
in
may,
first
saturday
in
may.
we
don’t
have
party
registration
in
texas.
when
you
go
in
to
a
party
primary
in
texas
you
are
simply
to
take
your
pole,
that
you’re
--
excuse
me,
your
poll
tax,
your
registration
certificate.
and,
and
you
--
it’s
stamped
that
you
voted
in
the
democratic
primary,
we
say
in
texas
that
put
some
moral
obligation
on
you.
there
is
no
legal
result
of
it
other
than
you
cannot
go
over,
for
example
and
participate
in
the
republican
convention
that
night,
that’s
against
the
law.
republicans
can’t
come
over
into
ours.
we
have
that
much
law
in
sanctity
to
our
processes.
nor
can
i
go
and
help
an
independent
candidate
get
his
petition.
nor
can
i
go
participate
in
any
convention
of
la
raza,
the
socialist
workers,
the
new
party
and
of
others
but
when
it
comes
to
november,
i
can
vote
for
whomever
i
please.
we
have
write-ins.
what’s
wrong
with
our
election
system?
mr.
john
l.
hill
absentee
balloting
is
a
remedial
piece
of
legislature.
a
very
great
thing
for
this
country
and
serves
a
very,
very
wonderful
purpose.
but
it’s
never
been
held
by
any
court
that
that
remedial
legislature
which
is
frankly
intended
for
those
who
must
have
or
should
have
for
reasons
of
frailty
or
absence.
a
problem
that’s
beyond
their
control
but
we
contemplate
in
this
country
as
i
understand
our
election
procedures
that
people
take
the
time
and
trouble
to
go
vote.
that’s
not
the
purpose
of
absentee.
voting
is
to
--
say
i
want
to
go
fishing
and
it’s
never
been
thought
nor
held
that
absentee
voting
must
be
opened
up
to
every
one
under
whatever
circumstances
they
may
be
operating
at
that
particular
time
in
their
political
development.
it’s
never
been
held
not
only
improper,
certainly
never
been
raised
for
the
(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
don’t
believe
mr.
chief
justice
--
i
mean
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
know
it’s
easy
to
criticize
and
if
this
did
may
be
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
don’t
say
it’s
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
i
say
it
outside
the
appeal
of
the
united
states
constitution
to
protect
the
rights
of
those
to
it.
you
and
i
and
others
may
agree
or
disagree
about
what
our
law
should
be
on
absentee.
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
say
it’s
beyond
the
scope
of
overturning
the
lower
courts
decision
in
this
case.
there
would
be
no
basis
in
my
humble
judgment
for
this
court
to
say
because
texas
has
not
seen
fit
to
plan
on
its
absentee
ballot.
in
our
state,
the
names
of
every
party
and
that’s
what
it
fall
down
to
what
happen
when
you
vote
absentee
in
texas
today
if
you
go
down
the
county
court
house
and
you’re
taken
to
a
voting
machine
or
a
printed
ballot
and
the
people
on
the
ballot
are
democrats
and
republican.
it’s
not
designed
though
it’s
a
discriminatory
matter.
it’s
not
done
in
our
state
for
that
reason.
it’s
simply
that
the
absentee
ballot
very
frankly,
justice
marshall,
it
would
be
obtained
today
by
the
texas
new
party
in
an
absentee
situation.
it’s
not
a
great
problem.
now
there
are
some
things
that
we
shouldn’t
have
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
well
sir.
it’s
not
a
great
problem
to
them.
where
is
the
hue
and
cry
from
the
texas
new
party
for
absentee
voting?
who
are
they
going
to
vote
absentee
today?
is
this
an
imaginary
problem
or
we
use
to
deal
hopefully
with
real
problem.
now
you
reach
your
point,
yes.
if
la
raza
may
have
reach
that
point.
i
don’t
foreclose
and
i
don’t
foreclose
a
circumstance
arising
while
another
party
was
sufficiently
strong
that
a
deprivation
of
absentee
balloting
really
would
dilute
down.
bear
in
mind
what
we
are
talking
about,
their
right
to
get
on
the
ballot,
that’s
involved
in
the
absentee
voting
so
far
as
the
minority
party
is
concern.
it
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
of
who
gets
elected.
it
has
to
do
with
whether
they
get
enough
people
to
get
on
the
ballot.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no
sir.
not
at
all.
not
all.
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
yes
sir.
i
like
to
think
that
i
am
but
my
party
is
that
the
absentee
balloting
is
not
in
my
own
judgment.
first,
a
severe
matter
as
far
as
numbers
are
concerned
and
secondly
it’s
been
held
by
the
court
that
it
does
not
rise
to
the
dignity
that
would
overthrow
an
election
law
or
an
election
process
from
a
constitutional
standpoint.
and
if
i
might
very
quickly
just
look
over
the
--
we
did,
we
discussed
the
5%
county
bonus
that
was
--
that
is
just
simply
a
manner
and
way
in
which
under
our
state
financing
law,
we
compensate
the
chairman
and
the
staff
of
those
who
are
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
conducting
the
election.
it’s
not
a
bonus.
it’s
just
a
method
that
we
have
selected
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
so
we
do
respectfully
submit
that
pursuant
to
the
law
pronounced
for
this
court
in
williams
versus
rhodes
respecting
at
all
times
the
right
of
the
vote
or
right
of
the
ballot
to
all
citizens
respecting
the
equal
protection
requirements
of
that
case.
knowing
that
you
require
us
to
show
compelling
state
interest
and
a
necessity
for
the
type
of
regulations
that
we
have,
we
do
submit
that
we
have
here
a
reasonable
system
and
one
that
is
not
meant
and
is
not
invidiously
discriminatory.
and
one
which
has
served
not
hindered
the
growth
of
minority
party
in
our
state
and
one
which
we
feel
is
reasonably
related
to
the
state
principles
that
we
feel
under
the
law,
we
have
a
right
to
carry
out.
that
is
to
further
the
notion
of
requiring
before
you
are
on
a
ballot
that
you
have
a
minimal
degree
of
support
and
that
you
not
raid
other
parties
to
obtain
that
support.
then
in
other
word
it’s
not
wrong
to
require
a
different
type
of
support
for
a
candidate
or
for
a
party.
so
that
he
can
have
some
semblance
of
a
reasonable
base
to
enter
the
process
and
appear
on
the
ballot.
i
think
if
you
did
not
have
at
least
those
minimal
requirements
you
would
have,
simply
a
confused
and
cluttered
chaotic
situation.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
hill
absolutely.
mr.
john
l.
hill
absolutely.
i
hope
i
had
made
that
clear
and
that’s
why
i
referred,
i
am
afraid
i
was
--
perhaps
i
apologize
greatly
about
if
i
offend
it
--
justice
marshall
i
simply
meant
to
state
that
the
use
of
absentee
voting
in
the
primary
posture
when
this
other
parties
are
having
conventions.
they’re
not
having
primary.
does
not
really
get
at,
the
same
problem
you
would
be
getting
at
is
if
after
they
have
gained
ballot
status
through
that
convention
process
then
of
course
they
should
be
accorded
and
they
are
accorded
the
right
to
absentee
balloting.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
john
l.
hill
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
want
to
first
thank
mrs.
svanas
for
filing
an
appendix
with
this
honorable
court
in
which
she
very
promisingly
asked
that
the
governor
signs
senate
bill
11.
i
filed
that
as
an
appendix
with
the
court
saving
us
the
trouble
of
doing
this.
i
think
it
speaks
very
clearly
for
itself
and
we
have
not
elaborated
by
any
additional
brief
but
with
reference
to
it.
second
thing,
i
would
like
to
say
that
particularly,
after
listening
to
him
although
i
have
known
him
in
houston
that
our
texas
admires
independent
candidates
and
we
want
people
like
mr.
hainsworth
to
stand
if
they
desire
as
independent
candidates
and
i
think
our
laws
have
accordingly
allowed
that.
i
need
to
speak
if
i
might
for
a
moment
factually
to
the
american
party
situation.
this
party
of
course
with
a
very
valuable
political
force
in
1968
in
our
state
with
over
91,000
signed
up
members
and
they
cast
584,269
votes
for
george
wallace
for
president.
now
since
the
american
party
elect
did
not,
for
reasons
of
their
own,
to
fill
a
governor
nominee
in
the
1968
general
election.
that
party
in
1970
was
required
under
our
statute
to
nominate
candidates
for
state
and
local
offices
for
the
general
election
by
conventions
and
when
the
party
did
not
file
with
--
more
required
and
my
represent
i
set
the
state
sufficient
certification
to
indicate
the
minimum
support
that
our
statutes
covering
these
matters
contemplate
something
in
the
neighborhood
as
22,000
conventioneers
or
if
that
many
people
don’t
get
to
the
convention,
we
permit
supplementation
by
petition
which
we
regard
as
a
helping
hand
not
as
a
deterrent
and
add
on
in
addition.
for
reasons
that
i
frankly
don’t
know
and
i
understand
and
the
record
is
sailing
on
it.
they
just
simply
had
6,828
names.
whether
they
were
--
that
was
because
of
their
tremendous
and
the
court
can
take
judicial
knowledge
of
their
great
participation
in
the
democratic
party
are
not,
i
did
not
know,
but
those
are
the
facts.
now
the
new
party,
on
the
other
hand,
represents
truly
just
what
it
is,
a
new
party
at
texas
new
party
we
don’t
know
very
much
about
it,
we’re
not
told
very
much
about
it.
this
court
is
not
told
much
about
it.
made
no
effort
at
all
under
this
record
to
have
any
compliance
and
that’s
where
that
matter
stand.
the
socialist
workers
party
did
comply
with
our
laws
and
they
were
on
the
ballot
and
they’re
--
while
filing
a
brief
here,
are
not
here
at
least
verbalizing
that.
and
i
don’t
know
of
any
substantial
complaint
that
they
raised.
well,
as
for
unida
who
took
no
appeal
from
this
matter
and
we
are
part
--
we
are
state
of
many
minority
parties
today,
just
a
proof
for
the
putting.
we
have
a
very
fine
gentleman
for
a
governor,
he
received
a
very
good
vote
and
they
qualified
under
the
2%
and
i’ll
discuss
how
our
procedure
works
in
a
little
more
detail
in
a
moment.
and
then
mr.
ronald
dunn
who
was
an
independent
candidate
for
the
united
states
house
of
representatives
and
represents
himself
and
before
the
independent
candidate
made
absolutely
no
attempt
to
meet
the
requirements
of
our
statute
with
reference
to
independent
candidates
and
simply
filed
suit
shortly
after
the
primary
elections.
of
course
he
has
a
perfect
right
to
do.
mr.
hainsworth
did
try.
had
he
not
obtained
for
reasons
that
i
am
sure
the
court
has
heard
here
and
whether
that
represent
inability
of
what
we
can’t
judge,
it’s
a
peculiarly
within
probably
in
his
mind
but
nonetheless
his
328
fell
short
of
the
500
which
we
believe
is
not
an
owner’s
burden
and
one
that
many
has
met.
he
filed
a
suit
attacking
the
constitutionality
of
these
provisions
in
a
very
candid
and
open
way
that
he
had
displayed
here
before
the
court.
now,
we
were
faced
in
texas,
of
the
last
session
of
the
legislature.
with
this
situation
we
will
face
with
williams
as
we
could
read
it
and
understand
it.
and
we
will
face
with
jenness
as
best
we
could
read
it
and
understand
what
this
honorable
court,
we
are
saying
to
the
state
in
this
area.
we
had
read
rosario
versus
rockefeller.
but
we
had
here
three
cases
in
which
this
court,
the
majority
of
this
court
had
been
heavily
involved.
in
addition
to
that,
you
had
written
bullock
versus
carter
arising
from
our
state
involving
our
financing
situation
of
our
filing
fees.
if
i
might,
in
that
text
--
in
that
context,
discuss
with
you
for
a
moment
senate
bill
11
that’s
here
as
in
the
appendix
which
was
passed
and
signed
by
our
governor
in
june,
the
15th
of
this
year,
it
provides,
one,
a
schedule
of
filing
fees
that
we
believe
are
in
keeping
with
the
rules
of
reasonableness
permitted
at
bullock
versus
carter
much
less
than
before,
much
legislative.
not
here
under
attack
and
permitting
the
filing
of
a
candidate
of
a
nominating
petition
in
lieu
of
the
payment
of
filing
fees
which
we
believe
is
very
progressive
in
keeping
with
carter
versus
bullock
and
not
here
under
attack
provides
perspectives
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes,
sir
5,000
in
the
statewide
case,
yes
sir.
and
the
notarization
mr.
chief
justice
marshall
as
far
as
i
am
aware
is
not
been
under
attack
in
any
decision
of
which
i
am
familiar
and
the
only
decision
in
which
the
matter
has
been
discussed
was
not
thought
to
be
a
constitutional
burden.
mr.
john
l.
hill
and
moreover
from
my
--
pardon
me.
mr.
john
l.
hill
oh!
yes.
much,
much
you
see
under
jenness
versus
georgia
if
we
use
jenness
and
in
this
--
this
can
be
considered
by
state.
the
time
to
speak
by
a
legislature
but
5%
of
our
total
electorate
in
texas
and
that
is
jenness.
it’s
not
5%
of
a
gubernatorial
candidate;
it’s
5%
of
the
electorate.
i
don’t
know
what
mrs.
svanas
and
others
would
say
that
constitutes
as
of
the
time
relevant
to
this
case
something
over
200,000
signatures.
and
we
would
be
passed
in
clearer
constitutional
muster.
under
jenness
we
just
walked
in,
off
our
hats,
and
walk
out.
we
have
elected
not
in
any
effort
to
hold
down
minority
parties
but
we
have
elected
in
our
state
in
an
effort
to
have
a
totally
fair
system
in
one
that
we
believe
is
much
preferable
to
georgia
and
much
fairer
to
georgia
to
have
1%,
1%
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
of
gubernatorial,
it
would
be
about
22,000
under
our
--
in
other
words
we
lack
a
lot
of
other
states
mr.
chief
--
mr.
justice
white,
don’t
vote
our
folks.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no,
sir.
mr.
justice
marshall
on
the
note
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
well
sir,
the
practical
answer
to
that
and
i
realized
that
we
have
a
current
problem
here
as
far
as
when
you
get
into
question
as
well
and
cost,
i
am
not
unmindful
of
that.
but
the
facts
are
that
notarization
is
allowed
and
not
have
the
statute
opened
here
is
allowed
in
bulk
on
certification
for
one
thing.
it
says,
that
the
certifying
officer
may
certify
the
petition.
i
might
just
--
one
certificate
of
the
officer
with
whom
before
whom
the
oath
is
taken
may
be
still
made
to
supply
all
to
whom
it
was
administered.
the
candidate
can
be
a
notary.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
there
can’t
be
some
cost
here
but
it’s
an
exaggerated
point
in
my
own
judgment.
mr.
john
l.
hill
he
has
--
you
mean
in
terms
of
the
independent
candidate?
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
sir,
this
is
the
basic
way
we
work
mr.
justice
white
is
two
conventions
on
minority
party.
we
presume
that
the
convention
will
be
held
on
the
same
day
that
we
as
democrats
vote
and
as
republicans
vote
and
all
other
parties
that
the
conventions
will
be
held
and
as
a
result
to
the
convention
the
22,000
people
will
attend
and
certify
their
names.
you
don’t
even
get
into
petitions.
the
only
way
we
get
into
petitions
that
all
in
texas
is
we
alight
as
a
supplement
to
the
convention
process.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no
--
well
it
could
be
a
total
substitute
but
our
tax
is
frankly
are
written
to
where
it
is
implied
in
the
statute
that
you
will
try
to
have
convention.
now
for
example
the
socialist
worker
party
in
qualifying
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
they
have
55
days
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
if
--
well
let
me
get
--
it
has
to
get
this
exactly
because
the
socialist
worker
party
for
example
got
all
of
their
petitions
by
conventions
in
harris
county.
you
don’t
have
to
have
precinct
conventions
all
over
our
state.
in
fact
it
would
be
kind
of
ridiculous
to
try.
you’re
not
required
by
law
to
do
it.
you
can
have
the
conventions
wherever
you
elect
to
have
those
conventions.
when
you
go
to
your
conventions,
our
minority
party
and
only
one
in
our
state
there
are
minority
party
or
those
who
didn’t
pull
over
2%
of
the
gubernatorial
vote
in
the
preceding
general
election.
so
we
don’t
have
a
very
harsh
rule
of
threshold
to
begin
with
but
when
they
go
under
that
rule
and
they
come
to
this
convention
processes,
it’s
anticipated.
they
can
go
out
all
of
the
time
our
elections
are
going
on
and
say,
“don’t
vote
in
that
democratic
primary,
i
want
you
to
come
to
our
convention”
we
are
going
to
have
it
the
same
day.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no,
sir.
it
works
this
way.
in
early
may,
we
have
our
first
democratic
primary,
our
first
primary.
on
that
same
day,
minority
parties
who
are
under
the
2%,
our
last
rule,
have
their
conventions
anytime
from
seven
to
seven.
when
they
go
into
those
conventions,
if
they
produce
and
they
can
have
them
in
one
county,
50
counties,
30
counties,
wherever
they
want
to
have
them
where
they
think
they
have
support.
they
can
bring
this
--
the
voters
in
--
their
people
into
those
conventions.
they
could
have
all
ready
told
them
and
had
it
planned
ahead
of
time
that
that’s
what
we
are
going
to
do.
then
when
i
get
there,
if
they
have
22,000
roughly
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
all
right
then
they
have
an
extra
period
of
time
up
until
the
latter
part
of
june
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
which
is
55
days.
mr.
john
l.
hill
to
supplement
the
convention
signatures
if
they
don’t
have
quite
enough.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes,
sir.
if
nobody
shows
up
at
all.
mr.
john
l.
hill
independent
candidate,
he
of
course
files
along
the
time
that
everyone
else
does.
he
has
--
he
can
start
getting
his
petitions
signed
after
the
primary
which
would
be
in
may
and
he
must
turn
a
man
30
days
after
the
second
--
after
the
runoff.
i
guess
adding
that
up
if
you
could
help
me
i
would
say
it
is
something
if
you
started
right
after
may
you
are
looking
at
the
better
part
of
two
months.
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
if
you
would,
if
you
start
it
only
after
the
second
runoff,
the
second
runoff.
in
other
word
if
you
started
after
the
june
runoff
to
get
the
independent
candidate
signatures
you
would
be
restricted
if
you
want
to
exclude
somebody
to
something
in
the
neighborhood
in
25
days.
it’s
my
thought
about
it
that
there
is
nothing
in
that
statute.
once,
the
may
primary
is
held
to
prevent
the
independent
candidate
from
securing
signatures.
mr.
john
l.
hill
i’m
sorry.
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
john
l.
hill
they
can
get
the
petition
anytime
after
they
filed
for
their
--
announcing
their
candidacy,
they
file
like
every
other
candidate
does
back
in
february.
mr.
john
l.
hill
they
could
get
the
petition
and
i
don’t
--
but
the
last
thing
i
want
to
do
is
a
make
a
misstatement,
i
don’t
--
first
i
don’t
know
for
certain.
i
believe
the
facts
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
don’t
believe
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
don’t
believe
that’s
correct.
i’m
not
sure
though
that
that
--
i
wouldn’t
think
the
case
would
in
anyways
depend
on
the
accuracy
of
–-
mr.
john
l.
hill
i’m
not
sure
sir.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
whether
he
had
the
petition
in
his
hand
in
february,
march
or
april
would
be
relatively
immaterial
because
he
can’t
get
anyone
to
sign
that
petition
until
after
the
primary
is
over.
unless
someone
wanted
to
say
categorically
ahead
of
time,
i’m
not
going
to
vote
in
the
democratic
or
republican
primary,
so
i
will
sign
your
petition
but
we
do
have
a
rule.
in
our
state
that
we
think
is
very
legitimate
and
very
necessary
that
does
prevent
those
who
sign
this
supplemental
petition
or
who
signed
the
petition
of
an
independent
candidate
not
to
vote
in
the
democratic
republican
la
raza
or
any
other
party
primary
that
we’re
holding
in
our
state.
mr.
john
l.
hill
the
same,
1%
of
the
vote
of
the
gubernatorial
candidates
and
the
preceding
general
election.
but
there
is
a
limitation
on
the
district
like
mr.
hainsworth,
i
believe
his
was
down
to
500
maximum,
500
maximum,
we
don’t
--
we
don’t
impose
that.
mr.
john
l.
hill
if
it’s
a
statewide
office,
it’s
more.
but
the
ones
before
this
court
are
all
one
for
congress
and
one
for
representative,
they
both
--
we
put
a
500
which
is
minimal.
if
you’re
going
to
have
a
system
of
elections
in
government
and
the
state
where
you
have
any
manner
or
way
to
not
discourage
the
independent
candidates,
not
to
discourage
the
minority
party
but
there
has
some
stability
to
have
some
ability
not
to
have
rating.
some
ability
not
to
have
candidates
come
in
to
your
primaries,
whatever
the
primary
is
and
try
to
vote
for
the
weakest
candidate
to
hurt
your
party
and
all
of
the
other
reasons
that
the
courts
have
approved
in
connection
with
anti-rating
provisions
or
provisions
to
show
minimal
support
so
that
you
don’t
have
total
chaos,
you
don’t
have
total
vote
of
confusion.
why
is
texas
here
to
defend
a
system
with
500
votes,
500
signatures?
i’d
be
the
last
to
want
to
just
defend
it
because
of
the
texas
statute
but
i
do
say
candidly
that
the
court,
this
is
--
this
we
have
500
in
connection
with
independent
candidate,
we
have
22,000
but
supplementary
petitions,
supplementary
petitions
in
our
state.
we
have
two
minority
parties
that
made
the
ballot.
we
have
the
other
party
here
complaining
that
all
548,000
votes
in
our
state
four
years
ago
and
can
turn
it
on
anytime
they
want
to
turn
it
on.
and
we
have
one
new
party
that
we
would
welcome
into
the
arena
of
good
ideas
and
new
ideas
because
they
do
that.
they
contribute
that
to
our
process.
clearly
they
do
and
that
is
why
we
have
a
constitutional
mandate
that
we’re
not
to
burden
them.
that
we’re
not
to
deprive
them
of
their
associational
rights,
we’re
not
to
burden
their
free
speech
and
we’re
to
accord
them
equal
protection.
but
nonetheless
the
courts
recognize
that
we
have
some
compelling
state
interest
and
when
we
show
that
there
is
a
necessity
for
what
we
do
and
that
it’s
reasonable
and
it
is
not
invidiously
discriminatory
and
not
intended
to
be.
in
fact
in
one,
i
honestly
say,
now
mrs.
svanas
in
all
fairness
describes
an
awful
lot
of
motives
to
an
awful
lot
of
thing
saying
but
those
are
words
and
she
is
free
to
express
them
but
constitutional
issues
can’t
be
decided
on
that
type
of
unsupported
rhetoric.
we
have
done
nothing
in
our
state
to
injure
her
party,
not
to
injure
other
parties.
we
don’t
meet
in
the
texas
legislature
just
to
revise
laws
for
that
purpose.
we
change
the
laws
in
our
state
in
1973
solely
because
we
were
trying
to
get
in
line
with
the
united
states
supreme
court
decisions
written
by
the
majority
of
the
just
to
cede
before
i
am
now
appearing
and
speaking
on
behalf
of
my
state.
we
wanted
to
comply
with
bullock
versus
carter.
that’s
precisely
why
justice
burger
you
told
us,
in
bullock
versus
carter
that
you
saw
when
we
suggest
it
that
if
we
went
to
a
state
financing
system
in
texas
we
might
run
in
to
some
problems
of
equal
protection
and
you
said
in
bullock
versus
carter
pointing
to
jenness,
pointing
to
jenness
but
have
the
cutoff
line
at
20%
for
parties
who
“should
take
on
the
burdens
of
primaries
and
under
20%
that
didn’t.”
so
we
changed
our
law
and
we
said,
alright,
everyone
that
pose
20%
can
come
in
under
state
primaries.
we
weren’t
trying
to
throttle
la
raza
unida.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
made
an
exception
for
it,
an
exception
for
them,
in
a
s.p.
11
so
they
could
have
an
option
this
year
as
to
whether
they
wanted
to
go
primary
or
convention
because
we
respect
it,
the
fact
that
they’d
earned
that
right
and
it
was
maintained.
but
now
we
are
faced
with
the
very
thing
that
we
were
trying
to
avoid
and
following
bullock
versus
carter
and
jenness
to
change
to
the
20%
and
allow
those
parties
to
have
state
financing
supplement
their
filing
fees.
we
have
a
convention
system
through.
if
georgia
to
be
accorded
constitutionality
because
she
elects
solely
to
valid
the
petition
system
which
has
five
--
ten
times
the
required
number
of
people
that
must
be
mustered.
for
gentleman
like
mr.
hainsworth
to
gain
the
ballot
as
opposed
to
the
texas
system
which
says
simply
conduct
conventions
on
election
day,
you
don’t
have
to
have
a
great
big
apparatus
like
was
required
in
ohio.
you
don’t
have
to
have
primary
elections.
you
don’t
have
to
send
delegates
to
the
nation
of
convention
as
they
did
in
williams
versus
rhodes.
all
we
ask
you
to
do
or
require
you
to
do
is
simply
to
have
conventions
in
counties
and
precincts
where
you
think
you
can
muster
some
support.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes,
sir
mr.
justice
white
and
if
we
were
to
have,
yes
sir
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
and
i
honestly
how
can
we
say
under
constitutional
principles
that
we
have
indeed
in
williams
and
jenness
and
rosario
of
the
majority
opinions
in
those
cases
and
the
compelling
state
interest
doctrine
a
necessity
that
that,
that
we
are
to
second
guess
that
kind
of
a
system
but
why?
22,000
signatures
gathered
together
to
convention
process
are
supplemented
if
--
if
you
had
a
minimal
--
we
are
to
require
some
minimal
degree
of
support
before
people
can.
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
simply
have
their
name
and
address
as
they
come
in
the
door.
they
sign
up
and
tell
who
they
are
and
where
they
live.
mr.
john
l.
hill
it
says
certified
and
delivered
to
the
secretary
state.
i
assume
that
the
state
chairman
or
county
chairman
or
precinct
chairman
would
certify
and
probably
notarize
them
but
it
doesn’t
matter,
it
doesn’t
matter,
it’s
not
a
very
relevant
point
in
my
opinion.
it
is
that
they
are
there
and
they
signed
up
and
the
--
after
it,
he
can
certify
the
whole
list
on
one
petition
under
one
notarization.
you
say
they’re
presumably
on
run
like
the
socialist
worker
party
has
one
big
meeting,
they
were
their.
they
turned
out,
they
signed
the
list
and
put
down
their
address
and
we
didn’t
challenge
one
of
them.
not
one
of
them,
they
were
sent
in,
they
had
enough
numbers
i
got
on
the
ballot.(voice
overlap)
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
certainly.
the
theory
only
is
--
only
disqualification
is
that
if
you
have
attended
the
democratic
or
republican
primary
and
voted.
but
we
did,
so
we
don’t
have
party
--
in
may,
first
saturday
in
may.
we
don’t
have
party
registration
in
texas.
when
you
go
in
to
a
party
primary
in
texas
you
are
simply
to
take
your
pole,
that
you’re
--
excuse
me,
your
poll
tax,
your
registration
certificate.
and,
and
you
--
it’s
stamped
that
you
voted
in
the
democratic
primary,
we
say
in
texas
that
put
some
moral
obligation
on
you.
there
is
no
legal
result
of
it
other
than
you
cannot
go
over,
for
example
and
participate
in
the
republican
convention
that
night,
that’s
against
the
law.
republicans
can’t
come
over
into
ours.
we
have
that
much
law
in
sanctity
to
our
processes.
nor
can
i
go
and
help
an
independent
candidate
get
his
petition.
nor
can
i
go
participate
in
any
convention
of
la
raza,
the
socialist
workers,
the
new
party
and
of
others
but
when
it
comes
to
november,
i
can
vote
for
whomever
i
please.
we
have
write-ins.
what’s
wrong
with
our
election
system?
mr.
john
l.
hill
absentee
balloting
is
a
remedial
piece
of
legislature.
a
very
great
thing
for
this
country
and
serves
a
very,
very
wonderful
purpose.
but
it’s
never
been
held
by
any
court
that
that
remedial
legislature
which
is
frankly
intended
for
those
who
must
have
or
should
have
for
reasons
of
frailty
or
absence.
a
problem
that’s
beyond
their
control
but
we
contemplate
in
this
country
as
i
understand
our
election
procedures
that
people
take
the
time
and
trouble
to
go
vote.
that’s
not
the
purpose
of
absentee.
voting
is
to
--
say
i
want
to
go
fishing
and
it’s
never
been
thought
nor
held
that
absentee
voting
must
be
opened
up
to
every
one
under
whatever
circumstances
they
may
be
operating
at
that
particular
time
in
their
political
development.
it’s
never
been
held
not
only
improper,
certainly
never
been
raised
for
the
(voice

mr.
john
l.
hill
i
don’t
believe
mr.
chief
justice
--
i
mean
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
know
it’s
easy
to
criticize
and
if
this
did
may
be
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
don’t
say
it’s
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
i
say
it
outside
the
appeal
of
the
united
states
constitution
to
protect
the
rights
of
those
to
it.
you
and
i
and
others
may
agree
or
disagree
about
what
our
law
should
be
on
absentee.
mr.
john
l.
hill
i
say
it’s
beyond
the
scope
of
overturning
the
lower
courts
decision
in
this
case.
there
would
be
no
basis
in
my
humble
judgment
for
this
court
to
say
because
texas
has
not
seen
fit
to
plan
on
its
absentee
ballot.
in
our
state,
the
names
of
every
party
and
that’s
what
it
fall
down
to
what
happen
when
you
vote
absentee
in
texas
today
if
you
go
down
the
county
court
house
and
you’re
taken
to
a
voting
machine
or
a
printed
ballot
and
the
people
on
the
ballot
are
democrats
and
republican.
it’s
not
designed
though
it’s
a
discriminatory
matter.
it’s
not
done
in
our
state
for
that
reason.
it’s
simply
that
the
absentee
ballot
very
frankly,
justice
marshall,
it
would
be
obtained
today
by
the
texas
new
party
in
an
absentee
situation.
it’s
not
a
great
problem.
now
there
are
some
things
that
we
shouldn’t
have
--
mr.
john
l.
hill
well
sir.
it’s
not
a
great
problem
to
them.
where
is
the
hue
and
cry
from
the
texas
new
party
for
absentee
voting?
who
are
they
going
to
vote
absentee
today?
is
this
an
imaginary
problem
or
we
use
to
deal
hopefully
with
real
problem.
now
you
reach
your
point,
yes.
if
la
raza
may
have
reach
that
point.
i
don’t
foreclose
and
i
don’t
foreclose
a
circumstance
arising
while
another
party
was
sufficiently
strong
that
a
deprivation
of
absentee
balloting
really
would
dilute
down.
bear
in
mind
what
we
are
talking
about,
their
right
to
get
on
the
ballot,
that’s
involved
in
the
absentee
voting
so
far
as
the
minority
party
is
concern.
it
doesn’t
have
anything
to
do
of
who
gets
elected.
it
has
to
do
with
whether
they
get
enough
people
to
get
on
the
ballot.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
hill
no
sir.
not
at
all.
not
all.
mr.
john
l.
hill
well,
yes
sir.
i
like
to
think
that
i
am
but
my
party
is
that
the
absentee
balloting
is
not
in
my
own
judgment.
first,
a
severe
matter
as
far
as
numbers
are
concerned
and
secondly
it’s
been
held
by
the
court
that
it
does
not
rise
to
the
dignity
that
would
overthrow
an
election
law
or
an
election
process
from
a
constitutional
standpoint.
and
if
i
might
very
quickly
just
look
over
the
--
we
did,
we
discussed
the
5%
county
bonus
that
was
--
that
is
just
simply
a
manner
and
way
in
which
under
our
state
financing
law,
we
compensate
the
chairman
and
the
staff
of
those
who
are
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
conducting
the
election.
it’s
not
a
bonus.
it’s
just
a
method
that
we
have
selected
to
accomplish
that
purpose.
so
we
do
respectfully
submit
that
pursuant
to
the
law
pronounced
for
this
court
in
williams
versus
rhodes
respecting
at
all
times
the
right
of
the
vote
or
right
of
the
ballot
to
all
citizens
respecting
the
equal
protection
requirements
of
that
case.
knowing
that
you
require
us
to
show
compelling
state
interest
and
a
necessity
for
the
type
of
regulations
that
we
have,
we
do
submit
that
we
have
here
a
reasonable
system
and
one
that
is
not
meant
and
is
not
invidiously
discriminatory.
and
one
which
has
served
not
hindered
the
growth
of
minority
party
in
our
state
and
one
which
we
feel
is
reasonably
related
to
the
state
principles
that
we
feel
under
the
law,
we
have
a
right
to
carry
out.
that
is
to
further
the
notion
of
requiring
before
you
are
on
a
ballot
that
you
have
a
minimal
degree
of
support
and
that
you
not
raid
other
parties
to
obtain
that
support.
then
in
other
word
it’s
not
wrong
to
require
a
different
type
of
support
for
a
candidate
or
for
a
party.
so
that
he
can
have
some
semblance
of
a
reasonable
base
to
enter
the
process
and
appear
on
the
ballot.
i
think
if
you
did
not
have
at
least
those
minimal
requirements
you
would
have,
simply
a
confused
and
cluttered
chaotic
situation.
mr.
john
l.
hill
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
l.
hill
absolutely.
mr.
john
l.
hill
absolutely.
i
hope
i
had
made
that
clear
and
that’s
why
i
referred,
i
am
afraid
i
was
--
perhaps
i
apologize
greatly
about
if
i
offend
it
--
justice
marshall
i
simply
meant
to
state
that
the
use
of
absentee
voting
in
the
primary
posture
when
this
other
parties
are
having
conventions.
they’re
not
having
primary.
does
not
really
get
at,
the
same
problem
you
would
be
getting
at
is
if
after
they
have
gained
ballot
status
through
that
convention
process
then
of
course
they
should
be
accorded
and
they
are
accorded
the
right
to
absentee
balloting.
thank
you
very
much.
