mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
the
honor
of
appearing
here
several
years
ago
on
the
issue,
first
impression
of
whether
or
not
the
states
should
be
required
to
have
a
post
conviction
remedies
and
the
case
of
case
versus
nebraska,
you
will
recall.
when
i
just
before
the
time
for
argument,
our
state
legislature
passed
post
conviction
remedy.
so,
i
came
back
armed
with
the
certified
copies.
unfortunately
i
don’t
have
anything
like
that
with
me
today,
but
this
court
praised
the
action
of
nebraska
at
any
rate,
in
the
interest
of
rates,
federal
relations
and
in
the
interest
of
comity
for
passing
a
post
conviction
remedy.
unfortunately
our
problems
haven’t
been
as
strong
in
this
area
as
they
have
been
in
the
area
of
civil
rights
action
as
this
court
knows
and
as
the
increase
in
federal
courts
is
growing
throughout
the
nation
in
civil
rights
actions.
but,
in
the
same
spirit,
i
would
like
to
urge
this
court
and
i
do
urge
this
court
that
as
honorable
chief
justice
burger
in
his
dissent
to
goldberg
v.
kelly
in
a
companion
case,
urged
at
that
time
that
as
these
administrative
regulations
are
involving
that
we
should
not
make
them
of
constitutional
quality
and
take
away
the
flexibility,
but
to
give
them
a
chance
to
evolve
and
that's
what
we
are
urging
here
as
briefs
on
both
sides
show.
we
are
i
think
in
pretty
much
agreement
of
what
we
want.
people
aren’t
really
saying
that
prisoners
shouldn’t
have
this
or
shouldn’t
have
that.
but,
it
is
more
of
a
question
of
whether
it
should
be
a
constitutional
quality
or
not.
and
the
groups
of
various
prison
administrators
are
constantly
working
and
making
model
regulations
and
so
on
as
the
briefs
also
show.
so,
on
that
part
we
would
strongly
urge
that
this
not
be
raised,
the
question
of
constitutional
standards.
mr.
justice
stewart
also
emphasizes
in
a
recent
case
of
preiser
v.
rodriquez,
when
he
was
pointing
the
need
for
exhausting
state
remedies
in
cases
of
habeas
corpus
type
and
he
specifically
stated
that
in
regard
to
prisons,
he
said,
since
these
internal
problems
of
state
prison
involve
the
issues
so
peculiarly
within
state
authority
and
expertise,
the
states
have
an
important
interest
in
not
being
by-passed
in
the
correction
of
these
problems.
i
think
the
same
with
equal
with
authority
be
stated
in
this
kind
of
a
situation.
of
course
the
question
also
gets
down
to
whether
the
inmate
has
actually
lost
liberty
in
instances
where
say,
he
is
taken
from
the
general
population
and
placed
in
adjustment
center
or
solitary
confinement,
has
he
lost
liberty
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
or
was
this
contemplated
at
the
time
of
his
due
process
trail,
his
due
process
sentence
and
partially
his
due
process
revocation
proceeding
or
probation.
was
this
liberty
then
taken
from
him?
what
does
the
judge
mean
when
he
says,
i
sentence
you
to
a
penitentiary.
after
all
this
due
process
had
been
given,
what
does
the
judge
actually
mean?
i
think
a
lot
of
judges
probably
themselves
don’t
know
the
situation
of
the
tears
of
the
cells
and
how
much
time
the
inmates
in
one
institution
work
and
how
much
in
another
they
work
or
how
much
they
are
involved
in
this
or
that.
so,
what
does
a
judge
mean
when
he
says,
i
sentence
you
to
the
penitentiary?
i
would
next
move
to
another
very
important
issue
in
this
case
your
honors
and
this
involves
the
interpretation
of
johnson
versus
avery
in
which
this
court
said
that
if
one
inmate
would
not
be
permitted
to
assist
another
in
preparation
of
legal
petitions
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings
then
the
prison
must
provide
some
alternative
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
in
the
present
case
went
on
to
say
that
we
must
also
consider
in
whether
this
alternative,
it
sounds
like
we
must
also
consider
civil
rights
act
and
we
say
this
is
an
extension,
a
great
extension
of
johnson
versus
avery
because
johnson
versus
avery
in
several
places
specifically
limited
the
case
to
habeas
corpus
proceedings
providing
us
alternative
and
if
it
is
extended
to
civil
rights
proceedings,
it
is
going
to
mean
a
terrific
increase
in
the
number
of
cases
and
as
this
court
knows
from
reading
the
multitude
of
cases
throughout
the
united
states
and
the
federal
district
courts
and
the
us
court
of
appeals,
these
inmates
will
sue
on
every
conceivable
possible
thing,
nearly
every
step
the
administration
takes
or
it
does
not
take.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
understand
them
to
mean
your
honor,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
in
considering
the
federal
--
remanded
the
federal
district
court
where
the
district
judge
determines
whether
or
not
nebraska
was
providing
a
reasonable
alternative
to
permitting
one
inmate
to
help
another
but
they
must
take
in
to
consideration
civil
rights
actions
as
well
as
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
i
think
they
meant
that
are
we
furnishing
inmate
assistance
for
the
civil
rights
act,
and
are
we
are
doing
it
sufficiently.
i
think
this
is
giving
a
new
completely,
new
constitutional
right
and
that
was
indeed
meant
over
even
contemplated
by
johnson
versus
avery.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
believe
we
do
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
the
sense
that
i
see
what
you
are
getting
at.
the
court
did
say
that
the
district
court
should
on
remand
determine
some
of
these
issues,
such
as
whether
--
in
what
situation,
right
to
counsel
for
example
is
required
at
this
point.
however,
we
are
also
arguing
in
another
point
that
this
cert
was
granted
in
this
case
as
who
should
make
the
initial
determination?
should
it
be
the
district
court
or
should
it
be
the
prison
administration,
and
then
review
those
characterial
things.
in
other
words,
shouldn't
the
court
set
the
guidelines
as
it
did
and
if
it
is
going
to
set
guide
lines
as
it
did
in
morrissey
versus
brewer,
as
to
future
cases
and
then
the
prison
administration
within
those
guidelines
would
have
to
set
the
rules.
so,
i
suppose
you
can
argue
all
around,
whether
how
federal
it
is,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
way
these
things
arise.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes
your
honor
i
do.
i
believe
that
especially,
i
may
question
of
right
to
counsel,
they
did
say
that
there
must
be
some
cases
where
there
is
right
to
counsels
and
which
is
a
new
extension.
it
also
presumed
that
there
are
constitutional
rights
to
some
due
process
at
this
primary
proceeding.
the
court
said
that
we
had
admitted
this,
we
had
admitted
this
as
far
as
revocation
of
good
time
because
morrissey
versus
brewer
came
back
in
the
mean
time,
reversing
eight
circuit
and
morrissey
versus
--
we
did
then
concede
that
as
far
as
good-time
was
concerned
that
there
was
due
process
due
in
nebraska
because
our
good-time
is
directly
related
eligibility
for
parole,
but
we
did
not
concede
that
there
was
any
due
process
due
in
any
other
disciplinary
proceedings
which
our
brief
in
the
eight
circuit
clearly
points
out.
i
am
sorry,
anyway
i
am
also
arguing
that
we
could
not
concede
constitutional
rights
one
way
or
the
another
way.
that
is
up
to
this
court
and
not
of
us
to
be
conceding,
what
are
the
constitutional
rights
or
what
they
are.
briefly,
i
would
like
to
hit
one
more
issue
and
then
i
will
be
through
your
honors
and
that
is
the
question
of
opening
attorney
inmate
mail
for
contraband.
we
feel
that
the
eight
circuit
rules
are
that
the
shut
down
on
this
case
would
be
difficult
to
administer
or
they
say
a
simple
telephone
call
to
the
attorneys
whose
name
appears
on
the
letter
would
determine
whether
the
attorney
had
actually
sent
the
letter
or
not.
first,
it's
not
a
matter
of
simple
telephone
call
especially
in
the
federal
premises
where
they
might
have
called
united
states.
a
lot
of
attorneys
are
hard
to
get
whole
lot
on
the
first
call
and
we
think,
it
would
be
much
simpler
if
there
is
some
quality.
they
also
state
that
in
appropriate
circumstances,
the
mail
could
be
opened
in
the
presence
of
the
inmate,
but
we
don't
know
what
appropriate
circumstances
are.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
we
do.
we
think
that
it
would
be
very
reasonable
to
open
the
mail
for
contraband
in
the
presence
of
inmate,
not
to
read
it
but,
merely
open
it
in
the
presence
of
inmates.
in
any
case,
where
they
question
it
without
saying,
they
have
to
make
a
telephone
call
to
somebody
first,
or
some
thing
like
that.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no
this
was
a
procedure
that
the
eight
circuit
indicated
in
their
opinion
in
this
case.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
don't
believe
so,your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
my
answer
was
that,
they
want
to
have
a
rule
where
they
can
open
the
mail
in
the
presence
of
the
inmate
for
contraband.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
well
they
don't
feel
they
can
under
the
opinion
in
this
case
from
the
eight
circuit
which
merely
says
inappropriate
circumstances.
if
they
don't
know
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
said
if
there's
any
question
but,
if
it
is
one
from
an
attorney,
a
simple
telephone
call
would
actually
question.
then
they
went
on
to
say,
inappropriate
circumstances
as
they
are
floor
sculpting
and
bending
would
not
reveal
them,
they
could
open
it
in
front
of
the
inmates.
the
only
trouble
there
is,
when
they
get
a
letter
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes
your
honor,
that's
how
i
interpret
that
opinion.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
brief
remarks
only
for
a
moment.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
first
on
the
question
of
raising
good
time
and
problems,
questioning
good
time
in
this
civil
rights
action,
what
this
case
is,
rather
than
habeas
corpus
proceeding
as
in
as
required
by
the
preiser
versus
rodriguez.
i
would
like
to
merely
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
preiser,
as
the
court
specifically
points
out,
there
was
not
only
direct
good
time
involved
but
these
man,
all
of
the
petitioners,
i
believe
as
you
were
asking
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
that
case,
also
did
not
accumulate
good
time
while
they
were
in
segregation
as
result
of
the
disciplinary
proceedings
for
which
they
lost
the
good
time.
so
there
are
both,
direct
good
time
and
the
good
time
which
they
did
not
accumulate.
this
court
there
said,
nevertheless,
you
must
bring
a
habeas
corpus,
unless
you
are
asking
for
damages
and
of
course
the
damage
issue
is
not
in
this
case
either.
secondly,
we
answered
the
eight
circuit
when
preiser
came
out
and
they
asked
for
a
supplement
and
the
state
of
nebraska
answered
the
eight
circuit
that
we
did
have
declaratory
judgment
remedy,
mandamus
remedy
and
asking
mandatory
injunction
remedy,
to
question
in
the
state
courts
whether
or
not
good
time
was
being
deprived
illegally.
since
the
good
time
is
provided
by
statute.
next
i
would
like
to
point
out
briefly,
or
emphasize
one
more
time,
that
i
think
is
a
very
serious
question,
whether
an
inmate
has
a
grievous
loss
in
any
of
these
situations.
i
think
his
grievous
loss
is
back
when
the
court
sentenced
him
to
that
penitentiary
or
when
the
court
decided
to
revoke
that
probation.
as
this
court
knows
and
must
got
an
idea,
we
have
come
a
long
way
on
the
question
of
what's
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
since
the
constitution
and
from
disembowelment
and
(inaudible)
and
all
the
various
kind
of
punishment
we
used
to
have.
well,
i
think
the
basic
question
really
involved
is
a
prison,
or
are
some
prisons
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
if
not,
if
what
is
contemplated
when
a
judge
sentences
a
man
to
this
place,
is
that
not
as
grievous
loss,
pointing
out
the
statute,
cited
in
our
at
the
beginning
of
our
brief.
in
nebraska,
the
statute
says,
the
court
shall
determine
when
he
sentences
the
men,
how
much
time
he
shall
spend
in
solitary
confinement.
what
period
of
his
sentence
shall
be
--
suppose,
judge
says,
i
sentence
you
to
one
year
in
solitary
confinement,
is
that
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
that
seems
to
me,
to
be
--
has
to
answered
first
and.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
don't
believe
it
is
your
honor
very
often.
i
believe
they
usually
have
a
path
phrase,
if
they
say
no
part
of
this
sentence
shall
be
in
solitary
confinement
except
for
violation
of
prison
rules,
is
pretty
much
the
standard
wording
of
it.
so
i
am
just
saying
it
could
be
possible.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
but
it
happens
all
over
united
states
your
honor
in
county
jail
cases
where
a
person
maybe
sentenced
to,
especially
in
smaller
counties
or
a
person
is
sentenced
to
a
county
jail
and
there
may
not
be
another
prisoner
in
there
for
months.
he
might
spend
a
year
in
county
jail
up
to
a
year
for
misdemeanors.
as
far
as
the
judge
knows
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
there
aren't
any
programs
or
maybe
--
some
of
these
county
jails
have
as
much
cells
for
maybe
12
people
or
so
but
that
may
have
only
one
person
in
there
for
long
time
or
maybe
one
here
and
one
over
there
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
well,
it's
a
question
of
what
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
is
a
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no
your
honor.
but
the
question
of
grievous
loss
in
here
and
i
am
saying,
merely
saying
that
the
eighth
circuit
by
incorporating
all
of
the
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
it's
part
of
it,
your
honor
yes.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes.
i
believe
that
this
is
a
question
which
needs
to
be
answered
mr.
justice
marshall
that
if
we
send
them
to
prison,
what
is
contemplated,
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
am
just
saying
what
is
contemplated
when
we
send
them
to
prison
your
honor,
not
advocating
that
by
any
means.
i
think
we
as
i
opened
and
i
would
like
saying
closing
your
honors,
i
think
we
are
all
after
the
same
thing,
we
are
after
rehabilitation.
we
do
have
programs
for
work
release
which
are
being
expanded
all
the
time.
we
have
extensive
parole
programs
and
all
of
these
things
that
are
developing.
the
programs
from
what
used
to
be
done
have
come
a
long
way
and
as
this
court
has
stated
many
times,
i
believe
that
these
evolving
programs
should
be
allowed
to
continue
develop
without
the
strict
constitutional
guidelines
of
this
type.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
had
the
honor
of
appearing
here
several
years
ago
on
the
issue,
first
impression
of
whether
or
not
the
states
should
be
required
to
have
a
post
conviction
remedies
and
the
case
of
case
versus
nebraska,
you
will
recall.
when
i
just
before
the
time
for
argument,
our
state
legislature
passed
post
conviction
remedy.
so,
i
came
back
armed
with
the
certified
copies.
unfortunately
i
don’t
have
anything
like
that
with
me
today,
but
this
court
praised
the
action
of
nebraska
at
any
rate,
in
the
interest
of
rates,
federal
relations
and
in
the
interest
of
comity
for
passing
a
post
conviction
remedy.
unfortunately
our
problems
haven’t
been
as
strong
in
this
area
as
they
have
been
in
the
area
of
civil
rights
action
as
this
court
knows
and
as
the
increase
in
federal
courts
is
growing
throughout
the
nation
in
civil
rights
actions.
but,
in
the
same
spirit,
i
would
like
to
urge
this
court
and
i
do
urge
this
court
that
as
honorable
chief
justice
burger
in
his
dissent
to
goldberg
v.
kelly
in
a
companion
case,
urged
at
that
time
that
as
these
administrative
regulations
are
involving
that
we
should
not
make
them
of
constitutional
quality
and
take
away
the
flexibility,
but
to
give
them
a
chance
to
evolve
and
that's
what
we
are
urging
here
as
briefs
on
both
sides
show.
we
are
i
think
in
pretty
much
agreement
of
what
we
want.
people
aren’t
really
saying
that
prisoners
shouldn’t
have
this
or
shouldn’t
have
that.
but,
it
is
more
of
a
question
of
whether
it
should
be
a
constitutional
quality
or
not.
and
the
groups
of
various
prison
administrators
are
constantly
working
and
making
model
regulations
and
so
on
as
the
briefs
also
show.
so,
on
that
part
we
would
strongly
urge
that
this
not
be
raised,
the
question
of
constitutional
standards.
mr.
justice
stewart
also
emphasizes
in
a
recent
case
of
preiser
v.
rodriquez,
when
he
was
pointing
the
need
for
exhausting
state
remedies
in
cases
of
habeas
corpus
type
and
he
specifically
stated
that
in
regard
to
prisons,
he
said,
since
these
internal
problems
of
state
prison
involve
the
issues
so
peculiarly
within
state
authority
and
expertise,
the
states
have
an
important
interest
in
not
being
by-passed
in
the
correction
of
these
problems.
i
think
the
same
with
equal
with
authority
be
stated
in
this
kind
of
a
situation.
of
course
the
question
also
gets
down
to
whether
the
inmate
has
actually
lost
liberty
in
instances
where
say,
he
is
taken
from
the
general
population
and
placed
in
adjustment
center
or
solitary
confinement,
has
he
lost
liberty
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution
or
was
this
contemplated
at
the
time
of
his
due
process
trail,
his
due
process
sentence
and
partially
his
due
process
revocation
proceeding
or
probation.
was
this
liberty
then
taken
from
him?
what
does
the
judge
mean
when
he
says,
i
sentence
you
to
a
penitentiary.
after
all
this
due
process
had
been
given,
what
does
the
judge
actually
mean?
i
think
a
lot
of
judges
probably
themselves
don’t
know
the
situation
of
the
tears
of
the
cells
and
how
much
time
the
inmates
in
one
institution
work
and
how
much
in
another
they
work
or
how
much
they
are
involved
in
this
or
that.
so,
what
does
a
judge
mean
when
he
says,
i
sentence
you
to
the
penitentiary?
i
would
next
move
to
another
very
important
issue
in
this
case
your
honors
and
this
involves
the
interpretation
of
johnson
versus
avery
in
which
this
court
said
that
if
one
inmate
would
not
be
permitted
to
assist
another
in
preparation
of
legal
petitions
in
habeas
corpus
proceedings
then
the
prison
must
provide
some
alternative
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
in
the
present
case
went
on
to
say
that
we
must
also
consider
in
whether
this
alternative,
it
sounds
like
we
must
also
consider
civil
rights
act
and
we
say
this
is
an
extension,
a
great
extension
of
johnson
versus
avery
because
johnson
versus
avery
in
several
places
specifically
limited
the
case
to
habeas
corpus
proceedings
providing
us
alternative
and
if
it
is
extended
to
civil
rights
proceedings,
it
is
going
to
mean
a
terrific
increase
in
the
number
of
cases
and
as
this
court
knows
from
reading
the
multitude
of
cases
throughout
the
united
states
and
the
federal
district
courts
and
the
us
court
of
appeals,
these
inmates
will
sue
on
every
conceivable
possible
thing,
nearly
every
step
the
administration
takes
or
it
does
not
take.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
understand
them
to
mean
your
honor,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
in
considering
the
federal
--
remanded
the
federal
district
court
where
the
district
judge
determines
whether
or
not
nebraska
was
providing
a
reasonable
alternative
to
permitting
one
inmate
to
help
another
but
they
must
take
in
to
consideration
civil
rights
actions
as
well
as
habeas
corpus
proceeding.
i
think
they
meant
that
are
we
furnishing
inmate
assistance
for
the
civil
rights
act,
and
are
we
are
doing
it
sufficiently.
i
think
this
is
giving
a
new
completely,
new
constitutional
right
and
that
was
indeed
meant
over
even
contemplated
by
johnson
versus
avery.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
believe
we
do
mr.
justice
blackmun
in
the
sense
that
i
see
what
you
are
getting
at.
the
court
did
say
that
the
district
court
should
on
remand
determine
some
of
these
issues,
such
as
whether
--
in
what
situation,
right
to
counsel
for
example
is
required
at
this
point.
however,
we
are
also
arguing
in
another
point
that
this
cert
was
granted
in
this
case
as
who
should
make
the
initial
determination?
should
it
be
the
district
court
or
should
it
be
the
prison
administration,
and
then
review
those
characterial
things.
in
other
words,
shouldn't
the
court
set
the
guidelines
as
it
did
and
if
it
is
going
to
set
guide
lines
as
it
did
in
morrissey
versus
brewer,
as
to
future
cases
and
then
the
prison
administration
within
those
guidelines
would
have
to
set
the
rules.
so,
i
suppose
you
can
argue
all
around,
whether
how
federal
it
is,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
way
these
things
arise.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes
your
honor
i
do.
i
believe
that
especially,
i
may
question
of
right
to
counsel,
they
did
say
that
there
must
be
some
cases
where
there
is
right
to
counsels
and
which
is
a
new
extension.
it
also
presumed
that
there
are
constitutional
rights
to
some
due
process
at
this
primary
proceeding.
the
court
said
that
we
had
admitted
this,
we
had
admitted
this
as
far
as
revocation
of
good
time
because
morrissey
versus
brewer
came
back
in
the
mean
time,
reversing
eight
circuit
and
morrissey
versus
--
we
did
then
concede
that
as
far
as
good-time
was
concerned
that
there
was
due
process
due
in
nebraska
because
our
good-time
is
directly
related
eligibility
for
parole,
but
we
did
not
concede
that
there
was
any
due
process
due
in
any
other
disciplinary
proceedings
which
our
brief
in
the
eight
circuit
clearly
points
out.
i
am
sorry,
anyway
i
am
also
arguing
that
we
could
not
concede
constitutional
rights
one
way
or
the
another
way.
that
is
up
to
this
court
and
not
of
us
to
be
conceding,
what
are
the
constitutional
rights
or
what
they
are.
briefly,
i
would
like
to
hit
one
more
issue
and
then
i
will
be
through
your
honors
and
that
is
the
question
of
opening
attorney
inmate
mail
for
contraband.
we
feel
that
the
eight
circuit
rules
are
that
the
shut
down
on
this
case
would
be
difficult
to
administer
or
they
say
a
simple
telephone
call
to
the
attorneys
whose
name
appears
on
the
letter
would
determine
whether
the
attorney
had
actually
sent
the
letter
or
not.
first,
it's
not
a
matter
of
simple
telephone
call
especially
in
the
federal
premises
where
they
might
have
called
united
states.
a
lot
of
attorneys
are
hard
to
get
whole
lot
on
the
first
call
and
we
think,
it
would
be
much
simpler
if
there
is
some
quality.
they
also
state
that
in
appropriate
circumstances,
the
mail
could
be
opened
in
the
presence
of
the
inmate,
but
we
don't
know
what
appropriate
circumstances
are.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
we
do.
we
think
that
it
would
be
very
reasonable
to
open
the
mail
for
contraband
in
the
presence
of
inmate,
not
to
read
it
but,
merely
open
it
in
the
presence
of
inmates.
in
any
case,
where
they
question
it
without
saying,
they
have
to
make
a
telephone
call
to
somebody
first,
or
some
thing
like
that.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no
this
was
a
procedure
that
the
eight
circuit
indicated
in
their
opinion
in
this
case.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
don't
believe
so,your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
my
answer
was
that,
they
want
to
have
a
rule
where
they
can
open
the
mail
in
the
presence
of
the
inmate
for
contraband.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
well
they
don't
feel
they
can
under
the
opinion
in
this
case
from
the
eight
circuit
which
merely
says
inappropriate
circumstances.
if
they
don't
know
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
said
if
there's
any
question
but,
if
it
is
one
from
an
attorney,
a
simple
telephone
call
would
actually
question.
then
they
went
on
to
say,
inappropriate
circumstances
as
they
are
floor
sculpting
and
bending
would
not
reveal
them,
they
could
open
it
in
front
of
the
inmates.
the
only
trouble
there
is,
when
they
get
a
letter
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes
your
honor,
that's
how
i
interpret
that
opinion.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
brief
remarks
only
for
a
moment.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
first
on
the
question
of
raising
good
time
and
problems,
questioning
good
time
in
this
civil
rights
action,
what
this
case
is,
rather
than
habeas
corpus
proceeding
as
in
as
required
by
the
preiser
versus
rodriguez.
i
would
like
to
merely
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
preiser,
as
the
court
specifically
points
out,
there
was
not
only
direct
good
time
involved
but
these
man,
all
of
the
petitioners,
i
believe
as
you
were
asking
mr.
justice
brennan,
in
that
case,
also
did
not
accumulate
good
time
while
they
were
in
segregation
as
result
of
the
disciplinary
proceedings
for
which
they
lost
the
good
time.
so
there
are
both,
direct
good
time
and
the
good
time
which
they
did
not
accumulate.
this
court
there
said,
nevertheless,
you
must
bring
a
habeas
corpus,
unless
you
are
asking
for
damages
and
of
course
the
damage
issue
is
not
in
this
case
either.
secondly,
we
answered
the
eight
circuit
when
preiser
came
out
and
they
asked
for
a
supplement
and
the
state
of
nebraska
answered
the
eight
circuit
that
we
did
have
declaratory
judgment
remedy,
mandamus
remedy
and
asking
mandatory
injunction
remedy,
to
question
in
the
state
courts
whether
or
not
good
time
was
being
deprived
illegally.
since
the
good
time
is
provided
by
statute.
next
i
would
like
to
point
out
briefly,
or
emphasize
one
more
time,
that
i
think
is
a
very
serious
question,
whether
an
inmate
has
a
grievous
loss
in
any
of
these
situations.
i
think
his
grievous
loss
is
back
when
the
court
sentenced
him
to
that
penitentiary
or
when
the
court
decided
to
revoke
that
probation.
as
this
court
knows
and
must
got
an
idea,
we
have
come
a
long
way
on
the
question
of
what's
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
since
the
constitution
and
from
disembowelment
and
(inaudible)
and
all
the
various
kind
of
punishment
we
used
to
have.
well,
i
think
the
basic
question
really
involved
is
a
prison,
or
are
some
prisons
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
if
not,
if
what
is
contemplated
when
a
judge
sentences
a
man
to
this
place,
is
that
not
as
grievous
loss,
pointing
out
the
statute,
cited
in
our
at
the
beginning
of
our
brief.
in
nebraska,
the
statute
says,
the
court
shall
determine
when
he
sentences
the
men,
how
much
time
he
shall
spend
in
solitary
confinement.
what
period
of
his
sentence
shall
be
--
suppose,
judge
says,
i
sentence
you
to
one
year
in
solitary
confinement,
is
that
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
that
seems
to
me,
to
be
--
has
to
answered
first
and.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
don't
believe
it
is
your
honor
very
often.
i
believe
they
usually
have
a
path
phrase,
if
they
say
no
part
of
this
sentence
shall
be
in
solitary
confinement
except
for
violation
of
prison
rules,
is
pretty
much
the
standard
wording
of
it.
so
i
am
just
saying
it
could
be
possible.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
but
it
happens
all
over
united
states
your
honor
in
county
jail
cases
where
a
person
maybe
sentenced
to,
especially
in
smaller
counties
or
a
person
is
sentenced
to
a
county
jail
and
there
may
not
be
another
prisoner
in
there
for
months.
he
might
spend
a
year
in
county
jail
up
to
a
year
for
misdemeanors.
as
far
as
the
judge
knows
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
there
aren't
any
programs
or
maybe
--
some
of
these
county
jails
have
as
much
cells
for
maybe
12
people
or
so
but
that
may
have
only
one
person
in
there
for
long
time
or
maybe
one
here
and
one
over
there
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
well,
it's
a
question
of
what
is
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
is
a
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
no
your
honor.
but
the
question
of
grievous
loss
in
here
and
i
am
saying,
merely
saying
that
the
eighth
circuit
by
incorporating
all
of
the
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
it's
part
of
it,
your
honor
yes.
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
yes.
i
believe
that
this
is
a
question
which
needs
to
be
answered
mr.
justice
marshall
that
if
we
send
them
to
prison,
what
is
contemplated,
--
mr.
melvin
kent
kammerlohr
i
am
just
saying
what
is
contemplated
when
we
send
them
to
prison
your
honor,
not
advocating
that
by
any
means.
i
think
we
as
i
opened
and
i
would
like
saying
closing
your
honors,
i
think
we
are
all
after
the
same
thing,
we
are
after
rehabilitation.
we
do
have
programs
for
work
release
which
are
being
expanded
all
the
time.
we
have
extensive
parole
programs
and
all
of
these
things
that
are
developing.
the
programs
from
what
used
to
be
done
have
come
a
long
way
and
as
this
court
has
stated
many
times,
i
believe
that
these
evolving
programs
should
be
allowed
to
continue
develop
without
the
strict
constitutional
guidelines
of
this
type.
