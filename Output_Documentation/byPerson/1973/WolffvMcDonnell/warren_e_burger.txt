chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
here
arguments
first,
this
morning
on
number
73-679,
wolff
against
mcdonnell.
mr.
kammerlohr
you
may
precede
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
view
court
of
appeals
as
having
made
a
constitutional
decision
in
general
outline?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
nebraska
doesn't
follow
the
federal
pattern
of
having
the
mail
opened
in
the
presence
of
the
inmate,
if
he
wants
it
done
that
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
do
or
don't.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
even
in
all
circumstances,
then
you
would
have
no
problem.
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that's
what
the
federal
system
does.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
it
has
a
tendency
to
harmonize
or
homogenize,
to
effect
of
the
treatment
of
prisoners
and
all
the
60
odd
federal
prisons
by
having
to
review
in
washington.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
duchek,
in
view
of
the
lateness
of
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
solicitor
general,
you
may
respond
to
that
if
you
wish,
usually
week
or
ten
days
or
what
would
you
like
for
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
10
days
alright.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
don't
you
want
relief
with
the
prison
administration,
some
range
of
discussion
as
to
whether
or
not,
they
should
treat
fraction
of
rules
as
a
criminal
act
or
merely
a
disciplinary
procedure.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
in
response
to
one
of
the
questions
that
under
the
present
nebraska
rules,
at
that
point,
they
have
the
counsel
substitute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
the
nebraska
rules
it
is
distinguished
from
the
court
of
appeal's
opinion.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
submit
it
to
the
clerk,
he
will
make
a
number
xerox
copies
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
the
constitutional
objection
to
the
system
used
in
the
federal
institutions
where
there
is
no
reading,
there
is
no
interception
that
merely
an
examination
for
contraband,
do
you
see
a
constitutional
objection
to
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
is
the
first
amendment
violated
if
the
content
is
not
read
at
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
active
opening.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
this
record
contain
any
information
about
the
frequency
of
narcotics
being
introduced
in
the
prisons
by
mail?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
has
been
a
significant
problem,
are
you
aware
of
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
if
the
prison
authorities
in
a
given
instance
are
willing
to
take
on
what
is
a
very
substantial
burden
in
terms
of
the
use
of
personnel
opening
but
not
reading.
do
you
really
see
in
this
context,
a
significant
constitutional
problem?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
federal
practice
doesn't
interfere
with
the
exchange
of
ideas
does
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
was
not
in
the
morrissey
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
the
standard.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
if
the
event
is
occurred
five
years
ago
that
you
will
say
there
are
no
problems
about
contacting
now.
i
remove
proceeding.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
morrissey
holding
that
did
not
provide
for
a
retroactive
effect
and
it
was
recognized
that
some
people
might
have
their
parole
revoked
pre-morrissey
in
circumstances
where
conceivably
it
might
not
have
been
finally
revoked
after
morrissey
and
that
was
a
deprivation
of
almost
total
freedom.
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whereas
here
there
is
a
deprivation
of
total
freedom
but
disciplined.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
kammerlohr?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
enough
time.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen
and
mr.
duchek,
you
appeared
by
appointment
of
the
court
at
our
request.
on
behalf
of
the

i
thank
you
for
your
assistance,
not
only
to
your
client
but
to
the

is
submitted.
