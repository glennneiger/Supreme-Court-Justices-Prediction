mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
united
states
is
quite
concerned
about
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit
and
that
the
possibility
that
constitutional
rules
formulated
in
this
case,
might
impair
the
freedom
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
continue
its
evolution
of
prison
disciplinary
procedures.
we
have
described
that
evolution
today
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief
and
i
won't
pause
discuss
it
here,
but
the
government
does
believe
that
its
current
procedures
in
disciplinary
actions
and
federal
prisons
accord
that
process
which
is
due
in
the
unique
setting
of
prison
life.
it
is
a
process
whose
objective
must
be
remembered
as
correction
and
rehabilitation
and
not
punishment.
the
constitutional
rule
devised
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit,
we
think
in
this
case,
are
dangerously
simplistic
because
they
ignore
both
the
objectives
of
prison
discipline
and
realities
of
prison
life.
these
rules,
i
think
would
severely
damage
the
mission
of
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
and
the
inmates
of
that
prisons.
we
have
discussed
in
our
brief
the
reasons,
why
the
rules
laid
down
by
the
eighth
circuit
should
in
any
event
not
be
applied
retroactively.
but
i
would
leave
that
to
the
brief
and
discuss
here,
the
rules
and
due
process
itself,
because
we
are
primarily
concerned
with
the
future
impact
of
these
rules.
the
basic
error,
we
think
in
the
opinion
below
was
its
mechanical
application
to
prison
disciplinary
procedures
of
the
procedural
requirements
laid
down
for
a
parole
and
probation
revocation
hearings
by
morrissey
against
brewer
and
by
gagnon
against
scarpelli.
the
morrissey
opinion
of
this
court
itself
warned
against
this
very
error
of
thoughtlessly
transposing
rules,
devised
for
one
factual
context
to
a
totally
different
factual
context.
in
morrissey,
this
court
stated
that
what
processes
do
under
varying
circumstances
is
to
be
determined
in
the
light
of
the
private
interest
affected
and
the
precise
nature
of
the
governmental
function
involved.
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
here
i
think
discloses
very
little
evidence
of
consideration
of
either
those
factors.
we
have
outlined
at
pages
13
and
15
of
our
briefs,
13
through
15
of
our
brief,
the
similarities
and
the
differences
between
the
morrissey,
scarpelli
standards
and
the
present
federal
bureau
of
prison
standards.
i
want
pause
to
discuss
them
in
detail
but
i
would
call
your
attention
to
the
fact
that
in
many
respects,
the
bureau's
procedures
today
meet
the
requirements
laid
down
by
morrissey
and
scarpelli.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
those
are
the
factors
specified
there
mr.
justice
stewart
in
morrissey,
for
determining
what
processes
do
under
varying
circumstances
and
the
first
is
the
private
interest
that
is
affected,
the
deprivation.
the
second
is
the
precise
nature
of
a
governmental
function
involved,
the
governmental
interest
and
that's
in
play
in
the
field.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
the
bureau
is
sensitive
to
degrees
of
deprivation,
i
think
is
shown
by
the
fact
apparent
from
the
chart
on
pages
13
to
15,
that
more
procedural
safeguards
are
provided
for
forfeitures
of
good
time,
which
is
a
greater
deprivation
than
for
lesser
disciplinary
actions
within
the
prison
and
that
these
procedures
are
effective.
i
would
suggest
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
as
the
bureau
informs
us,
the
washington
office
reverses
and
remands
from
20-25%
of
the
good
time
forfeitures
ordered
within
the
prison
system.
i
think
that
shows
effectiveness
and
not
the
contrary
because
we
all
know
that
federal
courts
also
have
a
reversal
rights
and
we
usually
regard
that
as
corrective
and
proper
relative
evidence
of
something,
being
wrong
at
a
lower
level.
i
would
also
point
out
--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
does
mr.
chief
justice,
they
are
certainly,
obviously
bound
to
differences
and
added
to
it
them
among
various
wardens
and
chief
executive
officers
and
federal
installations
and
this
procedure
does
just
as
you
say
tend
to
make
uniform
treatment
with
respect
to
forfeiture
of
good
time
and
i
would
also
emphasize
that
the
lack
of
an
automatic
review
and
the
lesser
disciplinary
actions
in
more
a
formal
matter
than
a
real
matter
because
any
prisoner
or
subject
to
a
disciplinary
action
of
any
sort
has
available,
the
prisoner's
mailbox
through
which
he
can
send,
uncensored,
unread
mail
to
any
member
of
the
executive
branch,
to
the
new
attorney
general
or
the
director
of
the
bureau
of
prisons,
and
any
congress,
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
any
judge
and
the
result
is
that
those
claims
are
referred
to
the
legal
office
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
and
they
are
reviewed
there
and
often
the
legal
officer
in
total
investigates
on
the
scene
to
determined
the
propriety
of
disciplinary
action.
the
principle
differences
between
the
standards
of
morrissey
and
scarpelli
and
present
federal
procedures
lies
in
four
areas.
the
first
is
the
right
to
confront
and
cross-examine
adverse
witnesses.
the
second
is
the
right
to
full
disclosure
in
every
case
of
all
the
evidence
that
maybe
relied
upon.
the
third
is
the
unqualified
right
to
present
witnesses
of
your
own
and
the
fourth
of
course
is
the
right
to
counsel.
those
are
rights
that
of
course
are
associated
with
criminal
prosecution.
parole
and
probation
revocations,
i
think,
much
more
closely
resemble
criminal
prosecution
in
their
effect
upon
the
individual's
liberty
than
does
a
prison
disciplinary
hearing.
the
individual
and
the
former
maybe
as
this
court
has
put
it
condemned
and
suffered
grievous
loss.
the
prison
inmate
is
in
a
different
position,
he
is
already
been
convicted
of
a
crime
and
is
living
in
a
prison
and
has
already
been
deprived
of
liberty
in
the
most
pervasive
manner.
he
lives
in
fact
in
a
thoroughly
regulated
and
controlled
society.
when
he
is
brought
up
for
disciplinary
action,
he
faces
a
range
of
sanctions,
ranging
from
reprimand,
temporary
loss
of
television
viewing
time,
perhaps
a
period
in
segregation
at
the
utmost
forfeiture
of
good
time.
the
deprivation
he
faces
in
that
sense
are
minimal
and
not
even
on
the
same
scale
of
magnitude
as
those
faced
by
a
man
who
is
liable
to
be
removed
from
free
society
and
put
behind
prison
walls,
for
a
period
of
years,
because
i
think
the
private
interest
affected
in
prison
disciplinary
actions
doesn't
suggest
much
less
required,
that
morrissey's,
scarpelli
standards
be
applied
to
those
actions.
when
we
look
at
the
other
factor
in
the
due
process
equation,
there
is
the
governmental
function
involved.
i
think
it
becomes
apparent
in
the
prison
setting,
the
morrissey's,
scarpelli
standards
are
not
only,
not
appropriate,
they
are
impossible.
we
could
start
by
considering
the
asserted
right
to
confront
and
cross-examine
adverse
witnesses.
suppose
that
an
inmate
observes
other
prisoners
beat
a
man
senseless
or
perhaps
the
observes
group
homosexual
rape.
if
that
witness
must
be
produced
in
a
preliminary
hearing,
identified,
confronted
and
cross-examined
and
then
return
to
a
prison
population.
it
may
be
doubted
that
he
will
have
a
life
worth
living
and
in
fact
it
may
be
doubted
that
hope
he
be
allowed
to
continue
to
live
his
life.
the
federal
prisons
as
other
prisons
have
had,
just
that
episodes
of
the
murder
of
inmate
informers.
transfer
to
d
other
federal
prisons
doesn't
solve
the
problem,
because
enough
prisoners
move
between
the
prisons
and
the
man
is
again
identified.
we
have
had
murders
of
men
who
had
been
transferred
because
they
informed
in
a
prior
prison.
i
think
we
should
consider
also
what
effect
that
kind
of
a
procedure
would
mean
for
prison
life
for
the
rest
of
the
prisoners
and
for
the
ability
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
carry
out
admission.
witnesses
to
prison
violence
or
the
acquisition
of
drugs,
weapons
or
other
contraband
would
simply
cease
to
come
forward.
they
would
be
completely
unwilling
to
subject
themselves
to
identification
and
to
reprise.
and
without
information
on
such
matters
would
be
impossible
for
the
federal
prisons
to
maintain
discipline
and
without
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
try
to
affect
rehabilitation.
the
prisons
would
become
in
effect
jungles
ruled
bands
of
violent
inmates.
under
such
circumstances,
i
think
the
possibility
of
an
existence
for
inmates
that
could
be
turned
human
would
be
impossible
and
certainly
there
would
be
no
question
of
rehabilitation.
and
i
might
point
out,
that
the
latest
figures
indicate
that
despite
the
fact,
the
federal
prisons
are
steadily
receiving
a
tougher
and
more
sophisticated
band
criminal.
still
their
recidivism
rate
is
declining.
i
don't
think
the
constitution
can
be
interpreted
to
require
that
kind
of
inhumanity
to
the
very
prisoners,
it
is
invoked
to
protect.
it
could
be
irony,
i
think
if
due
process
were
interpreted
to
require
slavery
within
the
prisons.
the
right
to
counsel
poses
similar
problems.
one
of
them
sheer
burden.
in
fiscal
1973
there
were
19,000
disciplinary
proceedings
within
the
federal
prisons.
so
the
right
to
counsel
would
impose
a
staggering
burden
but
more
importantly,
i
think
the
presence
of
lawyers
on
both
sides
will
change
the
procedure
completely
from
one
that
is
aimed
towards
rehabilitation
to
one
that
is
aim
towards
confrontation
and
delay
as
the
scarpelli
opinion
self
recognized.
when
you
bring
counsel
into
the
informal
proceeding
and
make
a
formal,
you
change
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
all
together.
changing
these
from
rehabilitative
and
corrective
procedures
and
rather
informal
discussions
between
an
adjustment
board
and
the
prisoner
is
bound,
and
turning
it
into
a
confrontation
between
the
accused
and
the
prosecution
is
bound
or
polarize
the
prison
community
with
a
consequent
increase
in
tensions
and
violence.
i
think
we
can
see
that
in
a
minor
scale,
anyone
who
has
lived
for
example,
through
the
recent
period
of
turmoil
in
the
universities,
knows
what
happens
when
ordinary
and
informal
disciplinary
processes
are
suddenly
made
formal.
for
the
man,
for
rights
and
procedures
is
in
itself
a
sign
of
anger,
and
when
you
are
granted
to
a
close
community,
the
result
is
to
ensure
polarization.
every
disciplinary
trial
in
the
law
school
becomes
a
contest
between
the
student
body
and
the
faculty.
when
convictions
occur
disruptions
break
out,
and
that
occurs
in
the
best
law
schools
in
this
country
and
it
did,
i
think
we
can
imagine
what's
going
to
happen
in
the
federal
prisons
if
we
go
through
the
same
kind
of
a
process.
we
have
within
the
federal
prisons,
a
large
body
of
men,
many
of
whom
have
already
demonstrated
the
propensity
for
violence.
i
don't
think
therefore,
these
rights
belong
in
the
federal
disciplinary
proceedings.
i
would
say
merely
a
word
about
the
prisoner
of
attorney
mail
matter.
in
the
federal
prisons,
mail
goes
out
unopened
and
unread
to
attorneys.
mail
that
comes
in
is
examined
only
for
contraband,
money,
drugs,
weapons
and
so
forth.
if
the
prisoner
wishes
and
the
attorney
wishes,
that
mail
would
be
opened
only
in
the
presence
of
the
inmate
so
it
can't
be
censored,
it
can't
be
read,
only
contraband
can
be
discovered,
i
think
that's
the
minimal
safeguard
and
one
that's
entirely
proper
and
necessary.
in
some,
the
united
states
thinks
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
insofor
as
it
applies
scarpelli
and
morrissey
rules
should
be
reversed.
as
law
we
think
in
supportable,
as
penology
we
think
it
was
disastrous.
mr.
robert
h.
bork

it

the

as
a
matter
of
fact
to
any
judge
and
the
result
is
that
those
claims
are
referred
to
the
legal
office
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
and
they
are
reviewed
there
and
often
the
legal
officer
in
total
investigates
on
the
scene
to
determined
the
propriety
of
disciplinary
action.
the
principle
differences
between
the
standards
of
morrissey
and
scarpelli
and
present
federal
procedures
lies
in
four
areas.
the
first
is
the
right
to
confront
and
cross-examine
adverse
witnesses.
the
second
is
the
right
to
full
disclosure
in
every
case
of
all
the
evidence
that
maybe
relied
upon.
the
third
is
the
unqualified
right
to
present
witnesses
of
your
own
and
the
fourth
of
course
is
the
right
to
counsel.
those
are
rights
that
of
course
are
associated
with
criminal
prosecution.
parole
and
probation
revocations,
i
think,
much
more
closely
resemble
criminal
prosecution
in
their
effect
upon
the
individual's
liberty
than
does
a
prison
disciplinary
hearing.
the
individual
and
the
former
maybe
as
this
court
has
put
it
condemned
and
suffered
grievous
loss.
the
prison
inmate
is
in
a
different
position,
he
is
already
been
convicted
of
a
crime
and
is
living
in
a
prison
and
has
already
been
deprived
of
liberty
in
the
most
pervasive
manner.
he
lives
in
fact
in
a
thoroughly
regulated
and
controlled
society.
when
he
is
brought
up
for
disciplinary
action,
he
faces
a
range
of
sanctions,
ranging
from
reprimand,
temporary
loss
of
television
viewing
time,
perhaps
a
period
in
segregation
at
the
utmost
forfeiture
of
good
time.
the
deprivation
he
faces
in
that
sense
are
minimal
and
not
even
on
the
same
scale
of
magnitude
as
those
faced
by
a
man
who
is
liable
to
be
removed
from
free
society
and
put
behind
prison
walls,
for
a
period
of
years,
because
i
think
the
private
interest
affected
in
prison
disciplinary
actions
doesn't
suggest
much
less
required,
that
morrissey's,
scarpelli
standards
be
applied
to
those
actions.
when
we
look
at
the
other
factor
in
the
due
process
equation,
there
is
the
governmental
function
involved.
i
think
it
becomes
apparent
in
the
prison
setting,
the
morrissey's,
scarpelli
standards
are
not
only,
not
appropriate,
they
are
impossible.
we
could
start
by
considering
the
asserted
right
to
confront
and
cross-examine
adverse
witnesses.
suppose
that
an
inmate
observes
other
prisoners
beat
a
man
senseless
or
perhaps
the
observes
group
homosexual
rape.
if
that
witness
must
be
produced
in
a
preliminary
hearing,
identified,
confronted
and
cross-examined
and
then
return
to
a
prison
population.
it
may
be
doubted
that
he
will
have
a
life
worth
living
and
in
fact
it
may
be
doubted
that
hope
he
be
allowed
to
continue
to
live
his
life.
the
federal
prisons
as
other
prisons
have
had,
just
that
episodes
of
the
murder
of
inmate
informers.
transfer
to
d
other
federal
prisons
doesn't
solve
the
problem,
because
enough
prisoners
move
between
the
prisons
and
the
man
is
again
identified.
we
have
had
murders
of
men
who
had
been
transferred
because
they
informed
in
a
prior
prison.
i
think
we
should
consider
also
what
effect
that
kind
of
a
procedure
would
mean
for
prison
life
for
the
rest
of
the
prisoners
and
for
the
ability
of
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
carry
out
admission.
witnesses
to
prison
violence
or
the
acquisition
of
drugs,
weapons
or
other
contraband
would
simply
cease
to
come
forward.
they
would
be
completely
unwilling
to
subject
themselves
to
identification
and
to
reprise.
and
without
information
on
such
matters
would
be
impossible
for
the
federal
prisons
to
maintain
discipline
and
without
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
try
to
affect
rehabilitation.
the
prisons
would
become
in
effect
jungles
ruled
bands
of
violent
inmates.
under
such
circumstances,
i
think
the
possibility
of
an
existence
for
inmates
that
could
be
turned
human
would
be
impossible
and
certainly
there
would
be
no
question
of
rehabilitation.
and
i
might
point
out,
that
the
latest
figures
indicate
that
despite
the
fact,
the
federal
prisons
are
steadily
receiving
a
tougher
and
more
sophisticated
band
criminal.
still
their
recidivism
rate
is
declining.
i
don't
think
the
constitution
can
be
interpreted
to
require
that
kind
of
inhumanity
to
the
very
prisoners,
it
is
invoked
to
protect.
it
could
be
irony,
i
think
if
due
process
were
interpreted
to
require
slavery
within
the
prisons.
the
right
to
counsel
poses
similar
problems.
one
of
them
sheer
burden.
in
fiscal
1973
there
were
19,000
disciplinary
proceedings
within
the
federal
prisons.
so
the
right
to
counsel
would
impose
a
staggering
burden
but
more
importantly,
i
think
the
presence
of
lawyers
on
both
sides
will
change
the
procedure
completely
from
one
that
is
aimed
towards
rehabilitation
to
one
that
is
aim
towards
confrontation
and
delay
as
the
scarpelli
opinion
self
recognized.
when
you
bring
counsel
into
the
informal
proceeding
and
make
a
formal,
you
change
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
all
together.
changing
these
from
rehabilitative
and
corrective
procedures
and
rather
informal
discussions
between
an
adjustment
board
and
the
prisoner
is
bound,
and
turning
it
into
a
confrontation
between
the
accused
and
the
prosecution
is
bound
or
polarize
the
prison
community
with
a
consequent
increase
in
tensions
and
violence.
i
think
we
can
see
that
in
a
minor
scale,
anyone
who
has
lived
for
example,
through
the
recent
period
of
turmoil
in
the
universities,
knows
what
happens
when
ordinary
and
informal
disciplinary
processes
are
suddenly
made
formal.
for
the
man,
for
rights
and
procedures
is
in
itself
a
sign
of
anger,
and
when
you
are
granted
to
a
close
community,
the
result
is
to
ensure
polarization.
every
disciplinary
trial
in
the
law
school
becomes
a
contest
between
the
student
body
and
the
faculty.
when
convictions
occur
disruptions
break
out,
and
that
occurs
in
the
best
law
schools
in
this
country
and
it
did,
i
think
we
can
imagine
what's
going
to
happen
in
the
federal
prisons
if
we
go
through
the
same
kind
of
a
process.
we
have
within
the
federal
prisons,
a
large
body
of
men,
many
of
whom
have
already
demonstrated
the
propensity
for
violence.
i
don't
think
therefore,
these
rights
belong
in
the
federal
disciplinary
proceedings.
i
would
say
merely
a
word
about
the
prisoner
of
attorney
mail
matter.
in
the
federal
prisons,
mail
goes
out
unopened
and
unread
to
attorneys.
mail
that
comes
in
is
examined
only
for
contraband,
money,
drugs,
weapons
and
so
forth.
if
the
prisoner
wishes
and
the
attorney
wishes,
that
mail
would
be
opened
only
in
the
presence
of
the
inmate
so
it
can't
be
censored,
it
can't
be
read,
only
contraband
can
be
discovered,
i
think
that's
the
minimal
safeguard
and
one
that's
entirely
proper
and
necessary.
in
some,
the
united
states
thinks
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
insofor
as
it
applies
scarpelli
and
morrissey
rules
should
be
reversed.
as
law
we
think
in
supportable,
as
penology
we
think
it
was
disastrous.
