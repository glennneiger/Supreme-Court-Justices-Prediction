what
do
you
understand
the
eight
circuit
to
have
said
mr.
kammerlohr
with
respect
to
what
the
world
would
have
to
in
connection
with?
justice
william

rehnquist
mr.
duchek--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
appendix
as
i
read
it
does
not
set
of
the
complaint
in
full.
i
take
it
that
mr.
mcdonnell
was
the
only
named
plaintiff
in
this
action,
am
i
right?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
he
allege
in
the
complaint
that
if
each
of
these
procedures
which
are
complained
about
had
actually
occurred
to
him?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
we
have
held
that
a
person
cannot
represent
a
class
of
which
he
is
not
a
member
and
i
would
think
you
might
have
some
understanding
problem
unless
he
had
alleged
that
each
of
things
about
which
the
complaint
sought
adjudication
had
occurred
to
him.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
in
the
nebraska,
he
ought
to
have
a
counsel
substitute
and
he
gets
it.
what's
this
case
of
about
in
that
aspect?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
this
disciplinary
committee
proceedings,
something
were
the
eight
circuit
opinion
went
further
than
you
really
think
their
constitution
required
it
to
go?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
colloquy
between
you
and
justice
white.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
the
existing
practice
in
nebraska
so
far
as
you
know?
