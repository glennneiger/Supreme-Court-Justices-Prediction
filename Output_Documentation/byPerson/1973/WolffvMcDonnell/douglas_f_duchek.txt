mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
think
10
days.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
perhaps
a
brief
history
of
this
case
would
be
in
order
at
this
time.
this
case
originally
filed
by
mr.
mcdonnel
pro
se
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
nebraska
and
it
was
really
a
broad
scope
and
broad
brush
challenge
to
most
of
the
rules,
practices
and
procedures
of
nebraska
penal
and
correctional
complex.
in
fact
the
entire
rule
book
is
attached
to
as
an
exhibit
to
filing
42
which
is
the
stipulation,
back
in
this
case.
several
of
challenges
were
settled
by
stipulation
and
appropriate
order
prior
to
trial.
the
mail
was
no
longer
stopped
that
was
meant
for
judges.
mail
was
no
longer
censored
and
deleted
that
was
meant
for
judges,
certain
library
rules
were
loosened
and
other
relief
was
given
by
consent
or
by
stipulation
and
appropriate
order
a
trail.
however
the
case
was
appealed
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
and
then
the
plaintiff
mr.
mcdonnell
filed
a
cross
appeal
after
the
state
appeal
from
the
trial
court's
decision.
the
state
decided
to
file
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court
following
the
court
of
appeal's
decision
and
raised
five
questions
but
it
appears
as
through
that
three
really
are
the
thrust
of
the
state's
discussion
before
this
court.
the
first
is
should
morrissey
and
scarpelli
rules
govern
that
present
disciplinary
hearing
which
may
impose
serious
penalties
or
a
grievous
loss
on
an
inmate
be
conducted
in
a
fundamentally
fair
manner?
do
the
morrissey
scarpelli
procedures
generally
attached
to
present
disciplinary
hearings?
the
states
concedes
that
when
good
time
sentence
credits
are
involved,
the
morrissey
scarpelli
procedures
in
a
general
fashion
attach.
the
eight
circuit
has
outlined
four
of
those
generally
that
would
attach.
good-time
although
after
preiser
v.
rodriguez,
could
not
be
restored
in
this
action.
it's
still
in
this
action
to
the
extent
that
it
is
a
grievous
loss
or
a
substantial
penalty
which
is
present
in
every
disciplinary
hearing
at
the
nebraska
penal
and
correctional
complex
because
good-time
in
nebraska
is
conferred
for
good
behavior
and
faithful
performance
of
duties
and
when
you
are
called
up
before
the
disciplinary
committee
because
of
an
alleged
misconduct,
the
finding
of
the
investigation
and
the
report
of
that
committee
when
placed
in
the
inmates
file
will
affect
the
eligibility
of
that
inmate
to
accumulate
future
good-time
and
to
be
eligible
for
consideration
for
release
on
parole
or
mandatory
release
under
supervision
at
a
certain
time
in
a
seconds.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
the
eight
circuit
asked
the
parties
to
address
themselves
to
that
point
after
the
case
was
under
submission
by
the
eight
circuit
and
mr.
kammerlohr
and
i
did
do
that
in
letters
to
the
eight
circuit
and
that
is
noted
in
a
footnote
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
that
was
my
argument
in
the
letters
that
we
addressed
to
the
eight
circuit
that
there
really
is
no
adequate
state
remedy
and
the
court
of
appeal's
reserve
that
decision
for
the
district
court
on
remand.
nebraska
does
not
have
a
great
writ
like
the
federal
great
writ.
its
writ
is
only
available
to
challenge
the
legality
of
the
sentence
and
that
is
was
the
sentence
imposed
within
the
confines
of
the
statuary
mandate.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
post-conviction
relief
act.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
post-conviction
relief
act
that
it
would
not
be
available
as
a
method
to
challenge
a
matter
in
the
prison
that
affected
your
good
time
credit,
so
that
has
to
deal
with
the
proceedings
whereby
you
are
incarcerated
in
prison.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
yes
sir.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
mr.
justice
rehnquist
the
complaint
raised
by
robert
o.
mcdonnell
individually
and
on
behalf
of
all
prisoners
in
the
same
class
is
plaintiff
incarcerated
in
nebraska
penal
and
correctional
complex,
lincoln,
nebraska,
and
on
behalf
of
all
of
other
persons
who
in
the
future
maybe
confined.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
do
not
know
that
he
alleged
that
each
of
the
procedures
complained
about
had
occurred
to
him
some
of
the
evidence
that
was
produced
at
the
trial
and
in
preliminary
hearings
demonstrated
that
each
of
the
complained
procedures
had
taken
place
against
members
of
the
inmate
class
and
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
he
alleged
that
they
had
either
occurred
to
him
as
i
remember
the
complaint
and
his
complaint
was
drafted
or
their
presence
chilled
his
right
to
exercise
certain
other
of
his
right
which
the
regulations
appeared
to
prohibit.
the
court
made
findings
under
rule
23
(c)
that
the
plaintiff
class
representative
r.o.
mcdonnell
did
was
a
proper
representative
that
there
were
question
of
law
and
facts
common
to
the
class
that
robert
o.
mcdonnell
was
a
proper
person
to
present
such
questions
of
law
and
fact
to
the
court
and
that
there
was
a
common
grievances
and
the
common
relief
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that
is
found
in
the
342
fed.
supp
in
a
paragraph
that
says
that
court
finds
that
this
is
a
proper
class
action
and
that
is
found
in
i
believe
paragraph
13
or
14
in
the
amended
complaint
where
we
setforth
the
allegations
as
to
the
class.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
what
is
that
mr.
justice
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that
is
right
your
honor
i
am
sorry
that
i
do
not
have
that.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
alright
thank
you
but
if
you
will
check
appendix
2
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
you
will
see
that
the
court
made
an
expressed
finding
that
it
was
a
proper
class
action.
i
would
point
out
that
in
the
amended
complaint
only
the
inmate
class
representative
sought
restoration
of
the
good
time
that
he
was
lost
and
the
balance
of
the
amended
complaint
seeks
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
as
to
the
legal
rights
and
relations
of
the
plaintiff
inmate
class
and
the
persons
who
are
named
as
party's
defendant.
the
real
thrust
of
the
morrissey
and
scarpelli
issues
before
the
court
today
can
be
find
in
the
language
in
morrissey
that
says
that
whatever
that
the
state
and
the
society
has
its
stake
in
these
cases
whatever
possibility
there
already
is
to
return
the
inmate
to
a
useful
and
normal
life
within
the
law,
morrissey
goes
on
to
to
say
that
the
state
and
society
have
no
interest
in
having
erroneous
factual
determinations
which
can
impose
or
which
find
that
a
person
has
violated
conditions
are
parole
or
prison
conduct
rules
and
the
state
or
society
has
absolutely
no
interest
in
taking
action
in
response
to
a
finding
of
misconduct
which
factual
record
does
not
clearly
indicate
the
response
that
is
the
required.
therefore
it
is
really
society's
interest.
there
is
perhaps
paramount
in
this
case
because
as
the
(inaudible)
case
points
out
justice
frankfurter's
concurring
opinion.
the
society,
a
democratic
one
and
the
popular
one
will
only
continue
to
be
effective
when
not
only
is
justice
done
toward
an
individual
but
the
community
sees
the
justice
has
done.
now
when
an
inmate
is
called
before
the
disciplinary
hearing
be
it
for
substantial
allegation
of
misconduct
in
which
he
can
be
placed
in
the
whole
or
segregation,
in
which
he
can
have
a
notation
made
in
his
record
that
will
continually
affect
his
eligibility
for
release
under
parole
or
some
early
release
or
when
he
has
placed
in
the
dry
cell
has
anything
taken
against
him
in
the
prison
that
result
in
his
being
removed
from
the
prison
population
and
put
in
a
solitary
state
where
he
is
isolated
from
other
prisoners,
from
the
programs
of
the
prison,
from
the
privileges
which
would
normally
attach
to
his
movement
within
the
present
society.
i
think
these
privileges
parallel
to
some
extent
what
the
chief
justice
described
as
in
the
other
enduring
attachments
of
everyday
life
that
are
available
to
person
when
he
is
outside
the
prison.
when
the
inmate
comes
before
the
disciplinary
committee
hearing
and
has
these
kinds
of
interests
at
stake
then
he
faces
a
grievous
loss
in
the
substantial
penalty
in
which
our
society
has
always
held
that
due
process
is
meant
to
protect.
why
would
the
bureau
of
federal
prisons
and
states
provide
the
real
wealth
of
protections
that
are
currently
provided
if
that
was
not
recognizing
that
it
was
one
imposing
a
penalty
on
this
individual
or
alleged
misconduct
or
two;
taking
some
action
that
substantially
affected
individual.
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
appendix
a
of
the
brief
of
the
respondent
which
contains
the
chart
that
of
a
disciplinary
proceedings
which
are
currently
given
by
the
various
penal
systems
in
the
country.
it
was
prepared
by
a
division
of
the
american
bar
association
and
it
sets
out
nicely
and
by
percentages,
what
elements
of
disciplinary
process
are
currently
provided.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well,
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
some
definition
made
of
what
is
a
grievous
loss
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
think
there
does
have
to
be
a
definition
or
determination
made
of
what
amounts
to
a
grievous
loss
when
an
inmate
is
to
be
punished
inside
a
prison.
the
respondent
believes
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well
i
think
the
court
of
appeal
said
that
anytime
there
was
a
substantial
penalty
which
could
be
imposed
such
as
solitary
confinement
or
placement
in
a
dry
cell.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
then
additionally
the
effect
on
good-time.
i
think
that
any
time
that
good-time
is
to
be
taken
from
an
inmate
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well,
i
do
not
understand
what
they
meant
by
that,
they
did
remand
the
case
or
hearings
to
determine
and
this
gets
to
the
final
judgment
question
that
was
asked
in
my
opinion
also.
they
did
remand
the
case
for
hearings
to
determine
what
procedures
were
necessary
to
give
procedurally
fair
process
and
if
those
procedure
were
being
met
except
that
the
court
and
the
district
court
could
not
restore
good
time.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well
i
wouldn't
think
there
was
under
like
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
not
under
the
definition
of
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that
is
right
it
will
be.
if
you
can
only
accumulate
good-time
by
good
behavior
and
faithful
performances
of
duties
and
you
are
called
before
the
disciplinary
committee
hearing
and
again
there
are
very
few
prisoners
that
are
called
before
the
disciplinary
hearing.
the
appendix
points
out
that
most
of
result
in
what
nebraska
calls
an
investigation
stage
or
confrontation
and
cross
examination
takes
place
by
the
way,
but
if
you
are
called
before
the
disciplinary
committee
hearing
and
the
report
goes
in
your
file
that
surely
must
be
an
indication
that
you
have
not
been
faithfully
performing
your
duties
or
on
good
behavior.
therefore
accumulating
good
time
is
not
forfeited
necessarily
and
that
maybe
which
you
are
getting
at
certainly
while
you
are
placed
in
solitary
confinement,
that
does
not
appear
that
the
prison
would
be
credited
with
any
good
time
there
because
you
had
failed.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
cannot
see
how
it
could
be
interpreted
and
understood
any
other
way
your
honor,
that
has
to
be
correct.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well
i
think
that
to
consider
placement
in
solitary
confinement
and
to
consider
placement
in
a
dry
cell
without
realizing
that
you
are
also
considering
good
time
accruals
is
not
to
give
the
case
its
full
attention.
i
think
the
case
warrants
that
the
court
understand
that,
that
is
what's
involved.
i
understand
that
there
maybe
some,
then
preiser
v.
rodriguez
issues
in
this
case,
but
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
resolve
those
by
saying
that
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
could
be
entered
but
rest
good
time
can
not
be
restored.
if
relief
is
given
for
those
situations
in
which
an
inmate
can
be
placed
in
solitary
or
confined
to
a
dry
cell,
a
fortiori
good
time
will
also
be
affected
because
they
wont
give
any
less
protection
for
those
kinds
of
matters
and
they
will
for
the
other
kinds
of
matters.
there
has
been
much
attention
made
and
raised
towards
this
idea
of
counsel
and
i
think
it's
important
for
the
court
to
know
that
this
respondent
and
this
plaintiff
has
never
asked
that
counsel
be
provided
in
a
good
time
hearing.
we
have
urged
that
a
counsel
substitute
is
necessary
and
counsel
substitute
is
provided
in
nebraska
and
this
plaintiff
is
--
that
counsel
substituted,
i
am
informed
and
thats
not
in
the
record
anywhere
here,
but
the
prisoner
has
recognized
him
that
someone
who
can
be
an
effective
person
to
help
them
explain
their
side
of
story.
now
counsel
substitute
can
be
any
number
of
people,
it
can
be
a
staff
member,
it
can
be
another
inmate,
it
can
be
a
law
student,
there
is
law
student
program
in
nebraska.
however,
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
go
one
step
further,
when
gagnon
came
down
and
said,
in
those
instances
where
fundamental
fairness
requires
it
and
where
i
take
it,
there
is
a
timely
and
tolerable
claim,
a
request
for
counsel
based
on
a
timely
and
tolerable
claim,
etcetera,
that
then
counsel
should
be
afforded.
now,
the
examples
raised
by
the
solicitor
general
are
interesting
in
that
regard
and
they
also
get
to
this
idea
of
the
impossibility
of
giving
fundamental
fairness
in
a
prison
situation.
if
there
was
an
assault,
an
assault
on
another
prisoner,
or
if
they
was
a
forcible
rape,
i
would
understand
those
to
be
matters
of
conduct
through
which
prosecution
is
possible.
in
fact,
they
are
probably
best
handled
by
prosecution
and
if
that's
the
case,
there's
going
to
have
to
be
a
witness
called
forward
and
there's
going
to
have
to
be
evidence
put
on
and
that
witness
is
going
to
swear
and
beyond
the
stand.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
we
certainly
do,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
does
the
responded
and
this
would
be
in
the
gray
area
where
rehabilitory
and
prison
expertise
can
best
be
exercised,
but
morrissey
also
provides
a
room
for
those
instances
that
the
solicitor
general
has
raised,
where
it
is
simply
for
security
reasons,
impossible
to
disclose
the
identity
of
the
informant.
i
would
put
it
to
court
that
if
a
man
has
written
up
for
the
kinds
of
situations
described
by
solicitor
general,
he
is
going
to
have
a
pretty
good
idea,
if
a
guard
didn't
see
it,
that
one
of
the
members
in
the
party
told
the
administration
about
it,
or
that
one
of
the
members
in
the
party
told
someone
else
about
it,
so
he
is
going
to
get
back
to
the
participants
one
way
or
the
other.
this
record,
the
record
now
before
the
court
in
the
great
majority
of
instances
will
disclose
employees
instigating
a
write-ups
and
in
fact
testimony
of
warden
wolf
in
the
appendix
never
once
mentions
an
inmate
instigating
the
write-up.
it
talks
about
a
supervisor
or
an
employee
seeing
conduct
that
he
believes
is
not
proper
conduct
in
initiating
the
write-up.
in
that
regard
mr.
kammerlohr
couldn't
bring
a
certified
copy
of
the
statue
to
the
court
but
there
are
new
rules
at
the
nebraska
prison,
which
have
been
in
effect
since
october
of
1973.
i
believe
they
are
reflected
in
the
chart
which
is
in
the
appendix
in
respondent's
brief
and
they
are
also
briefly
discussed
in
appendix-b
to
the
respondent's
brief
which
is
a
recapitulation
of
certain
rights
prepared
by
the
new
jersey
attorney
journals
office
in
a
law
suit
there
.counsel
substitute
is
not
part
of
nebraska
proceeding
and
if
the
court
will
read
warden
wolf's
testimony
at
one
of
the
evidentiary
hearings
in
this
matter,
the
court
will
note
that
in
the
investigative
stage
of
the
nebraska
prison
disciplinary
proceeding,
a
corrections
officer
calls
before
him,
the
accused
inmate
and
the
person,
they
–
and
it's
usually
a
job
supervisor
who
gets
the
accused
and
he
sits
them
down
before
them
so
that
they
may
talk
about
the
alleged
misconduct.
now,
that
is
confrontation
in
a
very
real
sense
of
the
term.
they
are
there
together.
the
record
does
not
really
bare
out
in
very
much
detail,
what
kind
of
cross-examination
goes
on,
but
i
don't
think
that
adversarial
cross-examination
is
what
anybody
is
talking
about.
i
think
they
are
talking
about
a
kind
of
testing
of
the
evidence
that
this
system,
this
anglo-american
system
has
always
found
necessary
and
has
always
found
the
only
way
to
make
factual
determinations,
when
persons
are
to
suffer
a
grievous
loss,
or
any
substantial
penalty
to
their
living
condition.
as
the
court
pointed
in
--
i
believe
it's
a
footnote
in
scarpelli,
and
i
think
it's
a
sound
believe,
the
state
has
within
its
power
to
very
creatively
respond
to
the
burdens,
the
constitutional
burdens
that
this
court
hands
down.
because
of
what
it
feels
is
constitutionally
required.
i
have
every
confidence
that
not
only
the
bureau
of
prisons
but
state
of
nebraska
and
all
other
states
can
respond
in
a
creative
fashion
to
any
constitutional
mandate
that
this
court
would
hand
down
and
all
that
we
are
talking
about
is
basic
fundamental
fairness
that
to
my
thinking
is
the
foundation
upon
which
our
system
is
constructed.
the
idea
that
some
of
the
things
that
we
are
requesting
in
this
case
are
in
the
antithesis
of
penology
is
subject
to
much
debate
in
the
organizing
this
case
and
indigent
prisoner
in
nebraska
complex
does
not
have
his
command,
the
resources
that
certainly
the
solicitor
general
and
the
united
states
government
has
in
hand
or
for
that
matter
the
state
in
nebraska
has
in
hand
and
therefore
the
respondent
had
to
assign
some
responsibilities
and
ask
for
some
help
in
this
area.
on
march
7th,
we
came
to
washington
and
we
had
a
meeting
with
certain
groups
that
might
be
called
public
interest
groups
to
assign
and
dwell
out
areas
of
responsibility
on
the
briefs
with
the
only
thought
in
mind
that,
if
we
could
prevent
overlapping
the
amicus
briefs
that
would
save
this
court's
time
in
readings
things
that
didn't
read
before.
therefore,
i
would
specifically
direct
the
court's
attention
especially
to
the
amicus
brief
of
the
national
counsel
and
crime
in
delinquency
which
the
respondent
believes
does
answer
some
of
the
questions
about
sound
penology
which
the
solicitor
general
has
raised.
that
amicus
brief
in
way
of
summary
does
point
out
that
by
reducing
the
sense
of
injustice
felt
by
most
prisoners,
the
provision
of
due
process
protections
in
disciplinary
hearings
alleviates
prison
tensions
and
enhances
the
possibility
for
a
cooperative
institution.
in
1870,
the
american
prison
administrator
society
and
the
american
prison
association
in
its
declaration
of
principles
acknowledged
that
an
inmate
should
plan
integrable
parties
on
rehabilitation
and
should
take
responsibility
for
that.
i
believe
that
opening
up
prison
disciplinary
hearings
and
allowing
for
input
and
a
testing
and
a
more
formalization
of
determinations
of
facts
which
will
have
a
substantial
impact
on
the
prisoner,
is
what
the
american
prison
association
was
talking
about
in
1870.
there
is
an
interesting
notation
in
the
case
of
(inaudible)
which
involve
john
v.
(inaudible)
who
was
at
the
time
in
segregation,
he
wrote
a
letter
on
september
30th
of
1969
to
his
parents
and
he
was
later
disciplined
for
that
letter
by
the
way,
in
which
he
was
reacting
basically
to
the
fact
that
he
was
in
solitary
confinement
and
bitterment
and
the
frustration
and
the
complete
rejection
of
the
processes
that
had
put
him
in
a
solitary
confinement,
i
think
really
buttresses
the
national
counsel
and
crime
delinquency's
argument
that
do
not
implement
procedures
which
one,
are
designed
to
bring
about
fair
results
but
two,
are
seen
by
the
community
at
large
to
bring
their
results
is
do
really
dis-service
in
the
american
correctional
system
that
perhaps
the
constitution
mandates
nothing
more
than,
and
perhaps
due
perhaps
mandates
nothing
more
than
that
the
nature
at
the
time
and
the
duration
in
the
nature
of
a
man's
confinement
bear
some
relation
to
the
purposes
of
his
commitment.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well,
there
would
be
an
observation
of
a
alleged
misconduct,
then
as
i
understand
it,
there
would
be
a
formal
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well,
let
me
then
just
make
one
preparatory
remark.
i
think
the
existing
procedures
or
as
i
have
them,
there
has
been
a
thought
that
everything
is
staid,
the
mandate
of
this,
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
was
staid
holds
everything
in
limbo
and
it's
very
difficult
to
know
what
is
actually
being
done
out
there,
but
i
believe
what
is
being
done
is
after
the
right,
after
the
observance
of
misconduct,
there
is
a
formal
write
up
of
that
incident,
a
notation
made
of
it
on
a
form
that
the
prison
has
designed.
that
form
then
goes
to
the
chief
corrections
officer
and
he
looks
at
that
form
and
he
sees
one
who
did
the
writing
up
or
who
has
done
the
act,
who
was
accusing
the
accusation,
who
has
made
the
charge
and
two
who
is
accused.
that
is
the
chief
corrections
officer's
responsibility
to
conduct
an
investigation
into
the
allegation
of
misconduct.
he
proceeds
to
conduct
that
investigation
and
he
does
that
by
bringing
the
person
that
is
doing
the
accusing
and
bringing
the
accused
into
his
presence
and
sitting
them
down,
i
would
take
it
and
discussing
with
them
this
charge
and
he
has
at
his
command,
the
ability
to
make
such
further
investigation
as
he
would
require.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
it's
adequate.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well,
if
that
was
done
in
front
of
the
disciplinary
committee
which
had
to
make
the
decision
about
what
kind
of
disposition
is
that
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that's
right.
the
correctional
officer,
if
he
can't
resolve
it
at
that
point
and
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
that
most
would
resolve
at
that
point.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that's
the
testimony
of
warden
wolf.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
no,
because
at
that
point,
there
would
not
be
a
substantial
penalty
or
a
griever's
loss
to
be
imposed
upon
the
prisoner.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
no,
sir,
not
again,
and
it's
because
there
is
no
--
as
i
understand
it,
that
this
time,
it
does
not
go
to
the
disciplinary
committee,
there
would
be.--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
if
he
disposes
it
by
reprimand
or
he
says,
okay,
you
better
stay
out
of
the
cafeteria
for
a
week
or
you
better
not
watch
tv
for
the
next
two
days.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
no,
that
moves
on
to
the
disciplinary
committee
and
that
was
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
come
to.
if
he
thinks
that
it
is
of
substantial
nature,
that
the
disciplinary
committee
has
to
impose
punishment,
then
he
would
send
it
on.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
to
some
extent.
yes,
i
take
it.
that's
what
would
be
in
his
report
and
this
then
would
be
where,
perhaps,
the
gagnon
ideas
might
come
into
this.
but
say
that
there
was
a
reason
that
the
conduct
occurred,
a
reason
which
is,
which
the
inmate
will
like
to
explain.
well,
at
that
hearing,
perhaps,
the
inmate
would
need
counsel
substitute
to
present
his
case.
i
think
the
better
approach
would
be,
quite
frankly,
is
if
the
matter
can
not
be
resolved
at
that
level,
that
there
will
be
a
factual
hearing
in
front
of
the
disciplinary
committee.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
alright.
so
you
are
just
sending
it
out
of
the
disciplinary
committee
for
--.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
think
that's
the
case,
yes,
alright.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
disciplinary
committee
feels
the
needs
to
have
an
adequate
factual
record
before
it
to
judge
this
conduct
so
that
it
may
impose
the
kind
of
sanctions
against
this
prisoner
that
it
directed
toward
rehabilitation,
it
is
respondent's
position
that
some
orderly
hearing
has
to
be
held
in
front
of
the
disciplinary
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
they
have
a
pre-sentence
report.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well,
they
doing
a
nebraska
prior
to
the
extent
that
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
alright.
the
accused
participates
to
the
extent
that
he
has
an
interview
with
the
pre-sentence
--
with
a
probation
officer.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that's
right.
i
would
assume
that
he
could,
well
if
he
admits
it,
if
he
admits
it
your
honor,
quite
frankly
that
the
problem
is
not
as
great
as
if
he
denies
it.
i
won't
contest
that
for
a
moment.
if
he
denies
it
though
--.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well,
it
would
seem
that
if
the
prisoner
wants
to
present
a
version
of
the
story
to
justify
the
conduct
occurred.
yes,
he
would
have
noticed.
he
is
called
for
disciplinary
committee
hearing.
even
after
the
confront,
even
after
the
confrontation
before
the
chief
investigation
officer,
he
will
have
a
notice.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
think
that
if
he
wanted
to
have
assistance
in
explaining
what
happened
and
why
it
happened,
counsel
substitute
would
be
appropriate
and
i
understand
it
in
nebraska,
he
would
get
it.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that's
right.
these
are
not
articulate
people.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well,
we
are
here
as
respondent.
so
in
that
aspect,
i
am
not
quite
certain,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
have
the
rules,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
have
the
rules
and
i
know
what
r
o
mcdonnell
tells
me
usually
happens.
i
also
know
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
mandate
has
been
staid
and
you
heard
mr.
kammerlohr's
attempt
to
explain
that
they
are
in
a
little
limbo
out
there,
about
what
they
are
supposed
to
do.
but
i
believe
that
the
chart
that's
in
the
appendix,
which
is
prepared
by
warden
wolff,
in
one
responses
from
warden
wolff,
we
will
indicate
what
they
are
doing
as
of
the
date
of
the
charge.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that's
correct,
except
that
i
know
it's
a
charge.
yeah.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
no.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
that
the
colloquy
between
mr.
justice
white
and
myself
would
be
perfectly
within
the
decision
of
the
eight
circuit.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
to
the
extent
that
i
can
read
that
chart
which
spoke
as
of
the
date
that's
indicated
in
there.
i
think
it's
of
october
1973
and
to
the
extent
that
the
evidence
of
warden
wolff
in
the
test,
in
the
record
of
this
case,
said
that
most
admit
their
guilt
and
it
would
only
go
on
to
the
disciplinary
committee
for
imposition
of
the
substantial
penalties,
that's
an
accurate
description
of
what
nebraska
now
does
and
i
think
that's
within
the
mandate
of
the
decision
of
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeal.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
know
that
they
can
have
a
counsel
substitute
before
the
disciplinary
committee.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
the
court
of
appeals
only
held
that
gagnon.
v.
scarpelli
might
dictate
certain
instances
where
a
lawyer
was
required,
when
fundamental
fairness
required
a
lawyer.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
not
to
anything
other
than
good-time.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that
is
exactly
right
and
to
answer
your
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
to
the
extent
that
they
feel
gagnon
would
never
require
a
lawyer
ever
within
a
prison
that
is
part
of
their
concern.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
no
if
i
understand
your
question
it
seems
to
me
that
in
most
disciplinary
proceedings
the
counsel
substitute,
be
a
staff
member,
another
lawyer
or
a
law
student
because
they
would
be
there
and
they
are
a
little
better
able
to
organize.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that
is
right.
procedures
adequate
to
meet
the
interest
that
are
at
stake
however
informal.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that
is
what
i
understand
the
situation
to
be
from
the
testimony.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well
it's
in
a
appendix
a
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
on
the
brief
to
the
respondent.
it's
at
page
11
of
the
study
itself
but
i
believe
it's
page
13a,
yes
it
is
page
13a
of
appendix.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
yes
sir.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
looks
like
your's
is
(inaudible)
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
do
you
have
it?
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that
is
the
chart.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
you
will
notice
that
a
100%
of
the
stake--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
can
get
it
in
this
size
i
will
be
happy
to
shedding
the
size.
i
guess
you
invited
that,
didn't
you?
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
take
the
average
age
of
the
court,
i
think
you
are
wise
to
do
that.
why
don't
i
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well
i
would
just
sufficient
copies
of
the
aba
study
in
total,
and
submit
those
to
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
the
chart
would
point
out
that
a
100%
of
the
answering
jurisdictions
claimed
in
the
chart
defines
claims
simply
to
mean
they
said
they
did
and
we
didn't
do
any
hearings
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
are
not
true.
a
100%
of
the
answering
jurisdictions
give
written
rules
specifying
offenses,
impartial
tribunal,
inmate
personally
appears,
inmate
hears
the
evidence
and
inmate
will
make
his
own
statement.
98%
inmate
receives
copies
of
rules,
inmate
receives
written
notice
of
charges
and
inmate
receives
prior
notice
of
the
hearing.
84%
or
higher
89%,
the
inmate
be
maybe
represented
by
counsel
substitute.
85%
based
on
a
decision
solely
on
the
evidence
of
the
hearing.
the
decisions
rendered
in
writing
an
88%
of
the
time,
inmate
has
appealed
84%
of
the
time
and
in
over
90%
of
the
time
inmates
may
appeal
the
decision
and
records
are
made
to
hearing.
79%
of
the
jurisdictions
allow
a
brief
continuance
and
54%
an
inmate
may
call
relevant
witnesses
and
64%
inmate
may
confront
witnesses
and
57%
inmate
cross
examine
adverse
witness.
now
that
cross
examination
is
not
a
trial
type
of
cross
examination
by
any
scope
of
the
imagination
and
it
is
described
in
greater
detail
in
appendix
3
of
the
brief
of
the
respondent,
which
is
that
recapitulation
from
the
attorney
journal
of
new
jersey.
i
am
moving
on
to
some
of
the
other
issues
which
have
been
raised
before
this
court
today.
the
respondent
believes
that
with
regard
to
the
mail
issue,
that
really
the
remedy
fashioned
by
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
perhaps
a
simpler
method
and
that
advocated
by
the
state
or
perhaps
allowed
by
the
bureau
of
prisons
the
amicus
brief
of
the
american
bar
association
on
this
issue
points
out
that
we
do
have
a
substantial
interest
at
stake,
that
being
accessed
to
the
courts
in
the
attorney-client
privilege
and
that
unless
there
is
really
a
probable
cause
or
a
reason
to
think
that
there
might
be
contraband
in
correspondence
addressed
to
an
inmate
--
is
there
really
any
reason,
a
justifiable
reason
to
interfere
with
this
first
amendment
right.
it
seems
to
the
respondent
that
having
to
take
the
mail
out
and
open
it
in
the
presence
of
the
inmate
or
having
the
inmate
come
to
room
where
you
open
the
mail
in
his
presence
there
begins
to
get
into
a
having
to
make
decisions
that
become
burdensome
and
that
the
most
you
would
ever
have
to
check
on
the
sender
of
the
piece
of
mail
would
be
once
and
if
you
determined
it
was
a
proper
piece
of
mail
to
be
delivered
it
could
be
delivered
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
it
seems
that
the
relief
fashioned
–
and
this
was
fashioned
by
judge
danny(ph)
who
was
in
nebraska
as
a
trial
judge
and
felt
that
this
was
a
proper
relief
for
the
interest
involved
on
the
government
side
and
on
the
inmate
side.
it
seems
to
the
respondent
that
this
is
not
burdensome
and
that
the
argument
of
the
respondent
in
this
regard,
in
his
brief
as
well
as
the
argument
in
amicus,
the
american
bar
association
that
clearly
underpins
its
position.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well,
the
constitutional
objection
would
perhaps
be
that
first
amendments
rights
are
preferred
and
that
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
only
by
the
delay
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that
is
right.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
don't
believe
that
it's
reproduced
in
the
appendix
which
you
will
find
it
in
the
record.
i
believes
it's
in
volume
3
which
is
a
transcript
of
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
yes
i
am
aware
of
that
and
nebraska
said
in
the
preliminary
hearing
testimony
that
it
had
devices
that
it
could
detect
some
drugs
and
that
is
part
of
the
reason
that
i
think
the
trial
court
was
influenced
in
the
decision
they
made.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
no,
i
think
that
a
constitutional
issue
is
the
exchange
of
ideas
your
honor
and
that
must
be
seen
and
however
that
can
be
done.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
not
if
its
properly
run
no.
i
think
to
the
extent
that
mail
is
ever
opened,
there
is
a
possibility
that
something
will
be
read
but
if
it
is
not
read
and
the
first
amendment
protection
is
afforded.
one
thing
which
the
respondent
would
like
to
talk
about
briefly
is
this
idea
of
expungement
from
the
records
of
determinations
of
misconduct
arrived
at
in
hearings
which
do
not
provide
the
inmate
procedural
duo
process
protection.
expungement
is
not
retroactive
application
of
procedural
rights
at
all.
it's
simply
giving
the
full
application
of
that
law
to
the
decision
that
's
been
reached
and
that
has
traditionally
been
the
practice
of
this
court
and
linkletter
v.
walker
was
deviation
from
that
practice.
there
will
be
no
one
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well
it
was
held
that
future
parole
revocations
would
be
conducted.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
but
really
the
situations
were
entirely
different
because
the
inmate
is
in
the
prison
and
he
is
going
to
stay
in
the
prison
and
expunging
from
his
record,
determinations
of
misconduct
held
in
hearings
where
the
facts
are
unreliable
is
not
going
to
allow
the
prisoner
for
any
earlier
release.
it
may
allow
him
for
earlier
consideration
for
parole
but
in
those
situations
where
the
prison
feels
society's
interest
is
that
there
be
a
notation
in
this
man's
record
of
serious
misconduct,
they
can
hold
the
hearing.
it
does
not
allow
anybody
to
walk
out
of
the
prison
because
of
a
backward
application.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
recognize
those
problems
but
i
think
that
they
can
try
to
hold
a
hearing
and
again
it
does
not
allow
the
man
to
get
out.
it
only
allows
him
for
--
it
only
allows
him
to
be
considered.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
right.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
just
think
that
the
burden
on
the
state
is
so
much
less,
expunging
the
record
is
so
much
less
that
there
need
not
be
the
kinds
of
considerations
about
giving
this
decision
full
application
of
a
law
that
would
attach
to
a
decision
like
morrissey
where
you
are
turning
somebody
loose
perhaps.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
think
10
days.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
perhaps
a
brief
history
of
this
case
would
be
in
order
at
this
time.
this
case
originally
filed
by
mr.
mcdonnel
pro
se
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
nebraska
and
it
was
really
a
broad
scope
and
broad
brush
challenge
to
most
of
the
rules,
practices
and
procedures
of
nebraska
penal
and
correctional
complex.
in
fact
the
entire
rule
book
is
attached
to
as
an
exhibit
to
filing
42
which
is
the
stipulation,
back
in
this
case.
several
of
challenges
were
settled
by
stipulation
and
appropriate
order
prior
to
trial.
the
mail
was
no
longer
stopped
that
was
meant
for
judges.
mail
was
no
longer
censored
and
deleted
that
was
meant
for
judges,
certain
library
rules
were
loosened
and
other
relief
was
given
by
consent
or
by
stipulation
and
appropriate
order
a
trail.
however
the
case
was
appealed
to
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
and
then
the
plaintiff
mr.
mcdonnell
filed
a
cross
appeal
after
the
state
appeal
from
the
trial
court's
decision.
the
state
decided
to
file
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
this
court
following
the
court
of
appeal's
decision
and
raised
five
questions
but
it
appears
as
through
that
three
really
are
the
thrust
of
the
state's
discussion
before
this
court.
the
first
is
should
morrissey
and
scarpelli
rules
govern
that
present
disciplinary
hearing
which
may
impose
serious
penalties
or
a
grievous
loss
on
an
inmate
be
conducted
in
a
fundamentally
fair
manner?
do
the
morrissey
scarpelli
procedures
generally
attached
to
present
disciplinary
hearings?
the
states
concedes
that
when
good
time
sentence
credits
are
involved,
the
morrissey
scarpelli
procedures
in
a
general
fashion
attach.
the
eight
circuit
has
outlined
four
of
those
generally
that
would
attach.
good-time
although
after
preiser
v.
rodriguez,
could
not
be
restored
in
this
action.
it's
still
in
this
action
to
the
extent
that
it
is
a
grievous
loss
or
a
substantial
penalty
which
is
present
in
every
disciplinary
hearing
at
the
nebraska
penal
and
correctional
complex
because
good-time
in
nebraska
is
conferred
for
good
behavior
and
faithful
performance
of
duties
and
when
you
are
called
up
before
the
disciplinary
committee
because
of
an
alleged
misconduct,
the
finding
of
the
investigation
and
the
report
of
that
committee
when
placed
in
the
inmates
file
will
affect
the
eligibility
of
that
inmate
to
accumulate
future
good-time
and
to
be
eligible
for
consideration
for
release
on
parole
or
mandatory
release
under
supervision
at
a
certain
time
in
a
seconds.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
the
eight
circuit
asked
the
parties
to
address
themselves
to
that
point
after
the
case
was
under
submission
by
the
eight
circuit
and
mr.
kammerlohr
and
i
did
do
that
in
letters
to
the
eight
circuit
and
that
is
noted
in
a
footnote
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
that
was
my
argument
in
the
letters
that
we
addressed
to
the
eight
circuit
that
there
really
is
no
adequate
state
remedy
and
the
court
of
appeal's
reserve
that
decision
for
the
district
court
on
remand.
nebraska
does
not
have
a
great
writ
like
the
federal
great
writ.
its
writ
is
only
available
to
challenge
the
legality
of
the
sentence
and
that
is
was
the
sentence
imposed
within
the
confines
of
the
statuary
mandate.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
post-conviction
relief
act.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
post-conviction
relief
act
that
it
would
not
be
available
as
a
method
to
challenge
a
matter
in
the
prison
that
affected
your
good
time
credit,
so
that
has
to
deal
with
the
proceedings
whereby
you
are
incarcerated
in
prison.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
yes
sir.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
mr.
justice
rehnquist
the
complaint
raised
by
robert
o.
mcdonnell
individually
and
on
behalf
of
all
prisoners
in
the
same
class
is
plaintiff
incarcerated
in
nebraska
penal
and
correctional
complex,
lincoln,
nebraska,
and
on
behalf
of
all
of
other
persons
who
in
the
future
maybe
confined.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
do
not
know
that
he
alleged
that
each
of
the
procedures
complained
about
had
occurred
to
him
some
of
the
evidence
that
was
produced
at
the
trial
and
in
preliminary
hearings
demonstrated
that
each
of
the
complained
procedures
had
taken
place
against
members
of
the
inmate
class
and
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
he
alleged
that
they
had
either
occurred
to
him
as
i
remember
the
complaint
and
his
complaint
was
drafted
or
their
presence
chilled
his
right
to
exercise
certain
other
of
his
right
which
the
regulations
appeared
to
prohibit.
the
court
made
findings
under
rule
23
(c)
that
the
plaintiff
class
representative
r.o.
mcdonnell
did
was
a
proper
representative
that
there
were
question
of
law
and
facts
common
to
the
class
that
robert
o.
mcdonnell
was
a
proper
person
to
present
such
questions
of
law
and
fact
to
the
court
and
that
there
was
a
common
grievances
and
the
common
relief
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that
is
found
in
the
342
fed.
supp
in
a
paragraph
that
says
that
court
finds
that
this
is
a
proper
class
action
and
that
is
found
in
i
believe
paragraph
13
or
14
in
the
amended
complaint
where
we
setforth
the
allegations
as
to
the
class.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
what
is
that
mr.
justice
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that
is
right
your
honor
i
am
sorry
that
i
do
not
have
that.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
alright
thank
you
but
if
you
will
check
appendix
2
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
you
will
see
that
the
court
made
an
expressed
finding
that
it
was
a
proper
class
action.
i
would
point
out
that
in
the
amended
complaint
only
the
inmate
class
representative
sought
restoration
of
the
good
time
that
he
was
lost
and
the
balance
of
the
amended
complaint
seeks
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
as
to
the
legal
rights
and
relations
of
the
plaintiff
inmate
class
and
the
persons
who
are
named
as
party's
defendant.
the
real
thrust
of
the
morrissey
and
scarpelli
issues
before
the
court
today
can
be
find
in
the
language
in
morrissey
that
says
that
whatever
that
the
state
and
the
society
has
its
stake
in
these
cases
whatever
possibility
there
already
is
to
return
the
inmate
to
a
useful
and
normal
life
within
the
law,
morrissey
goes
on
to
to
say
that
the
state
and
society
have
no
interest
in
having
erroneous
factual
determinations
which
can
impose
or
which
find
that
a
person
has
violated
conditions
are
parole
or
prison
conduct
rules
and
the
state
or
society
has
absolutely
no
interest
in
taking
action
in
response
to
a
finding
of
misconduct
which
factual
record
does
not
clearly
indicate
the
response
that
is
the
required.
therefore
it
is
really
society's
interest.
there
is
perhaps
paramount
in
this
case
because
as
the
(inaudible)
case
points
out
justice
frankfurter's
concurring
opinion.
the
society,
a
democratic
one
and
the
popular
one
will
only
continue
to
be
effective
when
not
only
is
justice
done
toward
an
individual
but
the
community
sees
the
justice
has
done.
now
when
an
inmate
is
called
before
the
disciplinary
hearing
be
it
for
substantial
allegation
of
misconduct
in
which
he
can
be
placed
in
the
whole
or
segregation,
in
which
he
can
have
a
notation
made
in
his
record
that
will
continually
affect
his
eligibility
for
release
under
parole
or
some
early
release
or
when
he
has
placed
in
the
dry
cell
has
anything
taken
against
him
in
the
prison
that
result
in
his
being
removed
from
the
prison
population
and
put
in
a
solitary
state
where
he
is
isolated
from
other
prisoners,
from
the
programs
of
the
prison,
from
the
privileges
which
would
normally
attach
to
his
movement
within
the
present
society.
i
think
these
privileges
parallel
to
some
extent
what
the
chief
justice
described
as
in
the
other
enduring
attachments
of
everyday
life
that
are
available
to
person
when
he
is
outside
the
prison.
when
the
inmate
comes
before
the
disciplinary
committee
hearing
and
has
these
kinds
of
interests
at
stake
then
he
faces
a
grievous
loss
in
the
substantial
penalty
in
which
our
society
has
always
held
that
due
process
is
meant
to
protect.
why
would
the
bureau
of
federal
prisons
and
states
provide
the
real
wealth
of
protections
that
are
currently
provided
if
that
was
not
recognizing
that
it
was
one
imposing
a
penalty
on
this
individual
or
alleged
misconduct
or
two;
taking
some
action
that
substantially
affected
individual.
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
appendix
a
of
the
brief
of
the
respondent
which
contains
the
chart
that
of
a
disciplinary
proceedings
which
are
currently
given
by
the
various
penal
systems
in
the
country.
it
was
prepared
by
a
division
of
the
american
bar
association
and
it
sets
out
nicely
and
by
percentages,
what
elements
of
disciplinary
process
are
currently
provided.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well,
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
some
definition
made
of
what
is
a
grievous
loss
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
think
there
does
have
to
be
a
definition
or
determination
made
of
what
amounts
to
a
grievous
loss
when
an
inmate
is
to
be
punished
inside
a
prison.
the
respondent
believes
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well
i
think
the
court
of
appeal
said
that
anytime
there
was
a
substantial
penalty
which
could
be
imposed
such
as
solitary
confinement
or
placement
in
a
dry
cell.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
then
additionally
the
effect
on
good-time.
i
think
that
any
time
that
good-time
is
to
be
taken
from
an
inmate
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well,
i
do
not
understand
what
they
meant
by
that,
they
did
remand
the
case
or
hearings
to
determine
and
this
gets
to
the
final
judgment
question
that
was
asked
in
my
opinion
also.
they
did
remand
the
case
for
hearings
to
determine
what
procedures
were
necessary
to
give
procedurally
fair
process
and
if
those
procedure
were
being
met
except
that
the
court
and
the
district
court
could
not
restore
good
time.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well
i
wouldn't
think
there
was
under
like
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
not
under
the
definition
of
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that
is
right
it
will
be.
if
you
can
only
accumulate
good-time
by
good
behavior
and
faithful
performances
of
duties
and
you
are
called
before
the
disciplinary
committee
hearing
and
again
there
are
very
few
prisoners
that
are
called
before
the
disciplinary
hearing.
the
appendix
points
out
that
most
of
result
in
what
nebraska
calls
an
investigation
stage
or
confrontation
and
cross
examination
takes
place
by
the
way,
but
if
you
are
called
before
the
disciplinary
committee
hearing
and
the
report
goes
in
your
file
that
surely
must
be
an
indication
that
you
have
not
been
faithfully
performing
your
duties
or
on
good
behavior.
therefore
accumulating
good
time
is
not
forfeited
necessarily
and
that
maybe
which
you
are
getting
at
certainly
while
you
are
placed
in
solitary
confinement,
that
does
not
appear
that
the
prison
would
be
credited
with
any
good
time
there
because
you
had
failed.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
cannot
see
how
it
could
be
interpreted
and
understood
any
other
way
your
honor,
that
has
to
be
correct.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well
i
think
that
to
consider
placement
in
solitary
confinement
and
to
consider
placement
in
a
dry
cell
without
realizing
that
you
are
also
considering
good
time
accruals
is
not
to
give
the
case
its
full
attention.
i
think
the
case
warrants
that
the
court
understand
that,
that
is
what's
involved.
i
understand
that
there
maybe
some,
then
preiser
v.
rodriguez
issues
in
this
case,
but
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
resolve
those
by
saying
that
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
could
be
entered
but
rest
good
time
can
not
be
restored.
if
relief
is
given
for
those
situations
in
which
an
inmate
can
be
placed
in
solitary
or
confined
to
a
dry
cell,
a
fortiori
good
time
will
also
be
affected
because
they
wont
give
any
less
protection
for
those
kinds
of
matters
and
they
will
for
the
other
kinds
of
matters.
there
has
been
much
attention
made
and
raised
towards
this
idea
of
counsel
and
i
think
it's
important
for
the
court
to
know
that
this
respondent
and
this
plaintiff
has
never
asked
that
counsel
be
provided
in
a
good
time
hearing.
we
have
urged
that
a
counsel
substitute
is
necessary
and
counsel
substitute
is
provided
in
nebraska
and
this
plaintiff
is
--
that
counsel
substituted,
i
am
informed
and
thats
not
in
the
record
anywhere
here,
but
the
prisoner
has
recognized
him
that
someone
who
can
be
an
effective
person
to
help
them
explain
their
side
of
story.
now
counsel
substitute
can
be
any
number
of
people,
it
can
be
a
staff
member,
it
can
be
another
inmate,
it
can
be
a
law
student,
there
is
law
student
program
in
nebraska.
however,
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did
go
one
step
further,
when
gagnon
came
down
and
said,
in
those
instances
where
fundamental
fairness
requires
it
and
where
i
take
it,
there
is
a
timely
and
tolerable
claim,
a
request
for
counsel
based
on
a
timely
and
tolerable
claim,
etcetera,
that
then
counsel
should
be
afforded.
now,
the
examples
raised
by
the
solicitor
general
are
interesting
in
that
regard
and
they
also
get
to
this
idea
of
the
impossibility
of
giving
fundamental
fairness
in
a
prison
situation.
if
there
was
an
assault,
an
assault
on
another
prisoner,
or
if
they
was
a
forcible
rape,
i
would
understand
those
to
be
matters
of
conduct
through
which
prosecution
is
possible.
in
fact,
they
are
probably
best
handled
by
prosecution
and
if
that's
the
case,
there's
going
to
have
to
be
a
witness
called
forward
and
there's
going
to
have
to
be
evidence
put
on
and
that
witness
is
going
to
swear
and
beyond
the
stand.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
we
certainly
do,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
does
the
responded
and
this
would
be
in
the
gray
area
where
rehabilitory
and
prison
expertise
can
best
be
exercised,
but
morrissey
also
provides
a
room
for
those
instances
that
the
solicitor
general
has
raised,
where
it
is
simply
for
security
reasons,
impossible
to
disclose
the
identity
of
the
informant.
i
would
put
it
to
court
that
if
a
man
has
written
up
for
the
kinds
of
situations
described
by
solicitor
general,
he
is
going
to
have
a
pretty
good
idea,
if
a
guard
didn't
see
it,
that
one
of
the
members
in
the
party
told
the
administration
about
it,
or
that
one
of
the
members
in
the
party
told
someone
else
about
it,
so
he
is
going
to
get
back
to
the
participants
one
way
or
the
other.
this
record,
the
record
now
before
the
court
in
the
great
majority
of
instances
will
disclose
employees
instigating
a
write-ups
and
in
fact
testimony
of
warden
wolf
in
the
appendix
never
once
mentions
an
inmate
instigating
the
write-up.
it
talks
about
a
supervisor
or
an
employee
seeing
conduct
that
he
believes
is
not
proper
conduct
in
initiating
the
write-up.
in
that
regard
mr.
kammerlohr
couldn't
bring
a
certified
copy
of
the
statue
to
the
court
but
there
are
new
rules
at
the
nebraska
prison,
which
have
been
in
effect
since
october
of
1973.
i
believe
they
are
reflected
in
the
chart
which
is
in
the
appendix
in
respondent's
brief
and
they
are
also
briefly
discussed
in
appendix-b
to
the
respondent's
brief
which
is
a
recapitulation
of
certain
rights
prepared
by
the
new
jersey
attorney
journals
office
in
a
law
suit
there
.counsel
substitute
is
not
part
of
nebraska
proceeding
and
if
the
court
will
read
warden
wolf's
testimony
at
one
of
the
evidentiary
hearings
in
this
matter,
the
court
will
note
that
in
the
investigative
stage
of
the
nebraska
prison
disciplinary
proceeding,
a
corrections
officer
calls
before
him,
the
accused
inmate
and
the
person,
they
–
and
it's
usually
a
job
supervisor
who
gets
the
accused
and
he
sits
them
down
before
them
so
that
they
may
talk
about
the
alleged
misconduct.
now,
that
is
confrontation
in
a
very
real
sense
of
the
term.
they
are
there
together.
the
record
does
not
really
bare
out
in
very
much
detail,
what
kind
of
cross-examination
goes
on,
but
i
don't
think
that
adversarial
cross-examination
is
what
anybody
is
talking
about.
i
think
they
are
talking
about
a
kind
of
testing
of
the
evidence
that
this
system,
this
anglo-american
system
has
always
found
necessary
and
has
always
found
the
only
way
to
make
factual
determinations,
when
persons
are
to
suffer
a
grievous
loss,
or
any
substantial
penalty
to
their
living
condition.
as
the
court
pointed
in
--
i
believe
it's
a
footnote
in
scarpelli,
and
i
think
it's
a
sound
believe,
the
state
has
within
its
power
to
very
creatively
respond
to
the
burdens,
the
constitutional
burdens
that
this
court
hands
down.
because
of
what
it
feels
is
constitutionally
required.
i
have
every
confidence
that
not
only
the
bureau
of
prisons
but
state
of
nebraska
and
all
other
states
can
respond
in
a
creative
fashion
to
any
constitutional
mandate
that
this
court
would
hand
down
and
all
that
we
are
talking
about
is
basic
fundamental
fairness
that
to
my
thinking
is
the
foundation
upon
which
our
system
is
constructed.
the
idea
that
some
of
the
things
that
we
are
requesting
in
this
case
are
in
the
antithesis
of
penology
is
subject
to
much
debate
in
the
organizing
this
case
and
indigent
prisoner
in
nebraska
complex
does
not
have
his
command,
the
resources
that
certainly
the
solicitor
general
and
the
united
states
government
has
in
hand
or
for
that
matter
the
state
in
nebraska
has
in
hand
and
therefore
the
respondent
had
to
assign
some
responsibilities
and
ask
for
some
help
in
this
area.
on
march
7th,
we
came
to
washington
and
we
had
a
meeting
with
certain
groups
that
might
be
called
public
interest
groups
to
assign
and
dwell
out
areas
of
responsibility
on
the
briefs
with
the
only
thought
in
mind
that,
if
we
could
prevent
overlapping
the
amicus
briefs
that
would
save
this
court's
time
in
readings
things
that
didn't
read
before.
therefore,
i
would
specifically
direct
the
court's
attention
especially
to
the
amicus
brief
of
the
national
counsel
and
crime
in
delinquency
which
the
respondent
believes
does
answer
some
of
the
questions
about
sound
penology
which
the
solicitor
general
has
raised.
that
amicus
brief
in
way
of
summary
does
point
out
that
by
reducing
the
sense
of
injustice
felt
by
most
prisoners,
the
provision
of
due
process
protections
in
disciplinary
hearings
alleviates
prison
tensions
and
enhances
the
possibility
for
a
cooperative
institution.
in
1870,
the
american
prison
administrator
society
and
the
american
prison
association
in
its
declaration
of
principles
acknowledged
that
an
inmate
should
plan
integrable
parties
on
rehabilitation
and
should
take
responsibility
for
that.
i
believe
that
opening
up
prison
disciplinary
hearings
and
allowing
for
input
and
a
testing
and
a
more
formalization
of
determinations
of
facts
which
will
have
a
substantial
impact
on
the
prisoner,
is
what
the
american
prison
association
was
talking
about
in
1870.
there
is
an
interesting
notation
in
the
case
of
(inaudible)
which
involve
john
v.
(inaudible)
who
was
at
the
time
in
segregation,
he
wrote
a
letter
on
september
30th
of
1969
to
his
parents
and
he
was
later
disciplined
for
that
letter
by
the
way,
in
which
he
was
reacting
basically
to
the
fact
that
he
was
in
solitary
confinement
and
bitterment
and
the
frustration
and
the
complete
rejection
of
the
processes
that
had
put
him
in
a
solitary
confinement,
i
think
really
buttresses
the
national
counsel
and
crime
delinquency's
argument
that
do
not
implement
procedures
which
one,
are
designed
to
bring
about
fair
results
but
two,
are
seen
by
the
community
at
large
to
bring
their
results
is
do
really
dis-service
in
the
american
correctional
system
that
perhaps
the
constitution
mandates
nothing
more
than,
and
perhaps
due
perhaps
mandates
nothing
more
than
that
the
nature
at
the
time
and
the
duration
in
the
nature
of
a
man's
confinement
bear
some
relation
to
the
purposes
of
his
commitment.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well,
there
would
be
an
observation
of
a
alleged
misconduct,
then
as
i
understand
it,
there
would
be
a
formal
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well,
let
me
then
just
make
one
preparatory
remark.
i
think
the
existing
procedures
or
as
i
have
them,
there
has
been
a
thought
that
everything
is
staid,
the
mandate
of
this,
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
was
staid
holds
everything
in
limbo
and
it's
very
difficult
to
know
what
is
actually
being
done
out
there,
but
i
believe
what
is
being
done
is
after
the
right,
after
the
observance
of
misconduct,
there
is
a
formal
write
up
of
that
incident,
a
notation
made
of
it
on
a
form
that
the
prison
has
designed.
that
form
then
goes
to
the
chief
corrections
officer
and
he
looks
at
that
form
and
he
sees
one
who
did
the
writing
up
or
who
has
done
the
act,
who
was
accusing
the
accusation,
who
has
made
the
charge
and
two
who
is
accused.
that
is
the
chief
corrections
officer's
responsibility
to
conduct
an
investigation
into
the
allegation
of
misconduct.
he
proceeds
to
conduct
that
investigation
and
he
does
that
by
bringing
the
person
that
is
doing
the
accusing
and
bringing
the
accused
into
his
presence
and
sitting
them
down,
i
would
take
it
and
discussing
with
them
this
charge
and
he
has
at
his
command,
the
ability
to
make
such
further
investigation
as
he
would
require.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
it's
adequate.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well,
if
that
was
done
in
front
of
the
disciplinary
committee
which
had
to
make
the
decision
about
what
kind
of
disposition
is
that
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that's
right.
the
correctional
officer,
if
he
can't
resolve
it
at
that
point
and
the
testimony
in
the
record
is
that
most
would
resolve
at
that
point.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that's
the
testimony
of
warden
wolf.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
no,
because
at
that
point,
there
would
not
be
a
substantial
penalty
or
a
griever's
loss
to
be
imposed
upon
the
prisoner.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
no,
sir,
not
again,
and
it's
because
there
is
no
--
as
i
understand
it,
that
this
time,
it
does
not
go
to
the
disciplinary
committee,
there
would
be.--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
if
he
disposes
it
by
reprimand
or
he
says,
okay,
you
better
stay
out
of
the
cafeteria
for
a
week
or
you
better
not
watch
tv
for
the
next
two
days.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
no,
that
moves
on
to
the
disciplinary
committee
and
that
was
exactly
what
i
wanted
to
come
to.
if
he
thinks
that
it
is
of
substantial
nature,
that
the
disciplinary
committee
has
to
impose
punishment,
then
he
would
send
it
on.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
to
some
extent.
yes,
i
take
it.
that's
what
would
be
in
his
report
and
this
then
would
be
where,
perhaps,
the
gagnon
ideas
might
come
into
this.
but
say
that
there
was
a
reason
that
the
conduct
occurred,
a
reason
which
is,
which
the
inmate
will
like
to
explain.
well,
at
that
hearing,
perhaps,
the
inmate
would
need
counsel
substitute
to
present
his
case.
i
think
the
better
approach
would
be,
quite
frankly,
is
if
the
matter
can
not
be
resolved
at
that
level,
that
there
will
be
a
factual
hearing
in
front
of
the
disciplinary
committee.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
alright.
so
you
are
just
sending
it
out
of
the
disciplinary
committee
for
--.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
think
that's
the
case,
yes,
alright.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
disciplinary
committee
feels
the
needs
to
have
an
adequate
factual
record
before
it
to
judge
this
conduct
so
that
it
may
impose
the
kind
of
sanctions
against
this
prisoner
that
it
directed
toward
rehabilitation,
it
is
respondent's
position
that
some
orderly
hearing
has
to
be
held
in
front
of
the
disciplinary
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
they
have
a
pre-sentence
report.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well,
they
doing
a
nebraska
prior
to
the
extent
that
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
alright.
the
accused
participates
to
the
extent
that
he
has
an
interview
with
the
pre-sentence
--
with
a
probation
officer.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that's
right.
i
would
assume
that
he
could,
well
if
he
admits
it,
if
he
admits
it
your
honor,
quite
frankly
that
the
problem
is
not
as
great
as
if
he
denies
it.
i
won't
contest
that
for
a
moment.
if
he
denies
it
though
--.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well,
it
would
seem
that
if
the
prisoner
wants
to
present
a
version
of
the
story
to
justify
the
conduct
occurred.
yes,
he
would
have
noticed.
he
is
called
for
disciplinary
committee
hearing.
even
after
the
confront,
even
after
the
confrontation
before
the
chief
investigation
officer,
he
will
have
a
notice.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
think
that
if
he
wanted
to
have
assistance
in
explaining
what
happened
and
why
it
happened,
counsel
substitute
would
be
appropriate
and
i
understand
it
in
nebraska,
he
would
get
it.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that's
right.
these
are
not
articulate
people.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well,
we
are
here
as
respondent.
so
in
that
aspect,
i
am
not
quite
certain,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
have
the
rules,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
have
the
rules
and
i
know
what
r
o
mcdonnell
tells
me
usually
happens.
i
also
know
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
the
mandate
has
been
staid
and
you
heard
mr.
kammerlohr's
attempt
to
explain
that
they
are
in
a
little
limbo
out
there,
about
what
they
are
supposed
to
do.
but
i
believe
that
the
chart
that's
in
the
appendix,
which
is
prepared
by
warden
wolff,
in
one
responses
from
warden
wolff,
we
will
indicate
what
they
are
doing
as
of
the
date
of
the
charge.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that's
correct,
except
that
i
know
it's
a
charge.
yeah.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
no.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
that
the
colloquy
between
mr.
justice
white
and
myself
would
be
perfectly
within
the
decision
of
the
eight
circuit.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
to
the
extent
that
i
can
read
that
chart
which
spoke
as
of
the
date
that's
indicated
in
there.
i
think
it's
of
october
1973
and
to
the
extent
that
the
evidence
of
warden
wolff
in
the
test,
in
the
record
of
this
case,
said
that
most
admit
their
guilt
and
it
would
only
go
on
to
the
disciplinary
committee
for
imposition
of
the
substantial
penalties,
that's
an
accurate
description
of
what
nebraska
now
does
and
i
think
that's
within
the
mandate
of
the
decision
of
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeal.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
know
that
they
can
have
a
counsel
substitute
before
the
disciplinary
committee.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
the
court
of
appeals
only
held
that
gagnon.
v.
scarpelli
might
dictate
certain
instances
where
a
lawyer
was
required,
when
fundamental
fairness
required
a
lawyer.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that's
correct.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
not
to
anything
other
than
good-time.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that
is
exactly
right
and
to
answer
your
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
to
the
extent
that
they
feel
gagnon
would
never
require
a
lawyer
ever
within
a
prison
that
is
part
of
their
concern.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
no
if
i
understand
your
question
it
seems
to
me
that
in
most
disciplinary
proceedings
the
counsel
substitute,
be
a
staff
member,
another
lawyer
or
a
law
student
because
they
would
be
there
and
they
are
a
little
better
able
to
organize.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that
is
right.
procedures
adequate
to
meet
the
interest
that
are
at
stake
however
informal.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that
is
what
i
understand
the
situation
to
be
from
the
testimony.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well
it's
in
a
appendix
a
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
on
the
brief
to
the
respondent.
it's
at
page
11
of
the
study
itself
but
i
believe
it's
page
13a,
yes
it
is
page
13a
of
appendix.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
yes
sir.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
looks
like
your's
is
(inaudible)
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
do
you
have
it?
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that
is
the
chart.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
you
will
notice
that
a
100%
of
the
stake--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
can
get
it
in
this
size
i
will
be
happy
to
shedding
the
size.
i
guess
you
invited
that,
didn't
you?
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
take
the
average
age
of
the
court,
i
think
you
are
wise
to
do
that.
why
don't
i
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well
i
would
just
sufficient
copies
of
the
aba
study
in
total,
and
submit
those
to
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
the
chart
would
point
out
that
a
100%
of
the
answering
jurisdictions
claimed
in
the
chart
defines
claims
simply
to
mean
they
said
they
did
and
we
didn't
do
any
hearings
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
are
not
true.
a
100%
of
the
answering
jurisdictions
give
written
rules
specifying
offenses,
impartial
tribunal,
inmate
personally
appears,
inmate
hears
the
evidence
and
inmate
will
make
his
own
statement.
98%
inmate
receives
copies
of
rules,
inmate
receives
written
notice
of
charges
and
inmate
receives
prior
notice
of
the
hearing.
84%
or
higher
89%,
the
inmate
be
maybe
represented
by
counsel
substitute.
85%
based
on
a
decision
solely
on
the
evidence
of
the
hearing.
the
decisions
rendered
in
writing
an
88%
of
the
time,
inmate
has
appealed
84%
of
the
time
and
in
over
90%
of
the
time
inmates
may
appeal
the
decision
and
records
are
made
to
hearing.
79%
of
the
jurisdictions
allow
a
brief
continuance
and
54%
an
inmate
may
call
relevant
witnesses
and
64%
inmate
may
confront
witnesses
and
57%
inmate
cross
examine
adverse
witness.
now
that
cross
examination
is
not
a
trial
type
of
cross
examination
by
any
scope
of
the
imagination
and
it
is
described
in
greater
detail
in
appendix
3
of
the
brief
of
the
respondent,
which
is
that
recapitulation
from
the
attorney
journal
of
new
jersey.
i
am
moving
on
to
some
of
the
other
issues
which
have
been
raised
before
this
court
today.
the
respondent
believes
that
with
regard
to
the
mail
issue,
that
really
the
remedy
fashioned
by
the
eight
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
perhaps
a
simpler
method
and
that
advocated
by
the
state
or
perhaps
allowed
by
the
bureau
of
prisons
the
amicus
brief
of
the
american
bar
association
on
this
issue
points
out
that
we
do
have
a
substantial
interest
at
stake,
that
being
accessed
to
the
courts
in
the
attorney-client
privilege
and
that
unless
there
is
really
a
probable
cause
or
a
reason
to
think
that
there
might
be
contraband
in
correspondence
addressed
to
an
inmate
--
is
there
really
any
reason,
a
justifiable
reason
to
interfere
with
this
first
amendment
right.
it
seems
to
the
respondent
that
having
to
take
the
mail
out
and
open
it
in
the
presence
of
the
inmate
or
having
the
inmate
come
to
room
where
you
open
the
mail
in
his
presence
there
begins
to
get
into
a
having
to
make
decisions
that
become
burdensome
and
that
the
most
you
would
ever
have
to
check
on
the
sender
of
the
piece
of
mail
would
be
once
and
if
you
determined
it
was
a
proper
piece
of
mail
to
be
delivered
it
could
be
delivered
and
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
it
seems
that
the
relief
fashioned
–
and
this
was
fashioned
by
judge
danny(ph)
who
was
in
nebraska
as
a
trial
judge
and
felt
that
this
was
a
proper
relief
for
the
interest
involved
on
the
government
side
and
on
the
inmate
side.
it
seems
to
the
respondent
that
this
is
not
burdensome
and
that
the
argument
of
the
respondent
in
this
regard,
in
his
brief
as
well
as
the
argument
in
amicus,
the
american
bar
association
that
clearly
underpins
its
position.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well,
the
constitutional
objection
would
perhaps
be
that
first
amendments
rights
are
preferred
and
that
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
only
by
the
delay
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
that
is
right.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
don't
believe
that
it's
reproduced
in
the
appendix
which
you
will
find
it
in
the
record.
i
believes
it's
in
volume
3
which
is
a
transcript
of
preliminary
hearing.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
yes
i
am
aware
of
that
and
nebraska
said
in
the
preliminary
hearing
testimony
that
it
had
devices
that
it
could
detect
some
drugs
and
that
is
part
of
the
reason
that
i
think
the
trial
court
was
influenced
in
the
decision
they
made.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
no,
i
think
that
a
constitutional
issue
is
the
exchange
of
ideas
your
honor
and
that
must
be
seen
and
however
that
can
be
done.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
not
if
its
properly
run
no.
i
think
to
the
extent
that
mail
is
ever
opened,
there
is
a
possibility
that
something
will
be
read
but
if
it
is
not
read
and
the
first
amendment
protection
is
afforded.
one
thing
which
the
respondent
would
like
to
talk
about
briefly
is
this
idea
of
expungement
from
the
records
of
determinations
of
misconduct
arrived
at
in
hearings
which
do
not
provide
the
inmate
procedural
duo
process
protection.
expungement
is
not
retroactive
application
of
procedural
rights
at
all.
it's
simply
giving
the
full
application
of
that
law
to
the
decision
that
's
been
reached
and
that
has
traditionally
been
the
practice
of
this
court
and
linkletter
v.
walker
was
deviation
from
that
practice.
there
will
be
no
one
--
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
well
it
was
held
that
future
parole
revocations
would
be
conducted.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
but
really
the
situations
were
entirely
different
because
the
inmate
is
in
the
prison
and
he
is
going
to
stay
in
the
prison
and
expunging
from
his
record,
determinations
of
misconduct
held
in
hearings
where
the
facts
are
unreliable
is
not
going
to
allow
the
prisoner
for
any
earlier
release.
it
may
allow
him
for
earlier
consideration
for
parole
but
in
those
situations
where
the
prison
feels
society's
interest
is
that
there
be
a
notation
in
this
man's
record
of
serious
misconduct,
they
can
hold
the
hearing.
it
does
not
allow
anybody
to
walk
out
of
the
prison
because
of
a
backward
application.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
recognize
those
problems
but
i
think
that
they
can
try
to
hold
a
hearing
and
again
it
does
not
allow
the
man
to
get
out.
it
only
allows
him
for
--
it
only
allows
him
to
be
considered.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
right.
mr.
douglas
f.
duchek
i
just
think
that
the
burden
on
the
state
is
so
much
less,
expunging
the
record
is
so
much
less
that
there
need
not
be
the
kinds
of
considerations
about
giving
this
decision
full
application
of
a
law
that
would
attach
to
a
decision
like
morrissey
where
you
are
turning
somebody
loose
perhaps.
