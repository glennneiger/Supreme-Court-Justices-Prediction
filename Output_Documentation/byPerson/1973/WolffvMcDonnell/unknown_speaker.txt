unknown
speaker
well,
the
court
of
appeals,
they
certainly
would
require
to
do
more
than
that.
unknown
speaker
the
eight
circuit
would
not
permit
to
--,
would
not
permit
you
simply
to
open
every
piece
of
mail
in
the
presence
of
the
inmate
without
more,
you
have
to
have
a
better
reason
than
that
to
open
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
solicitor
general,
you
said
two
factors,
where
you
thought
have
been
partially
disregarded
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
i
missed
those,
what
were
they?
unknown
speaker
cafeteria
workers,
that
sort
of
--
unknown
speaker
why
were
the
state
procedures
reviewed
for
deprivation
of
good-time?
unknown
speaker
is
that
true
even
under
the
view
of
--
unknown
speaker
post-conviction
relief
falls
to
cases
of
nebraska.
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
found?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
a
record
citation
or
is
it
in
the
appendix?
unknown
speaker
the
finding.
well,
if
you
look
into
brief
of
nebraska's
petition
for
certiorari
at
appendix
2
on
the
page
somewhere
in
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
do
not
waste
your
time.
unknown
speaker
well
the
only
one
here
(inaudible)
is
solitary
confinement
being
placed
to
the
dry
cell.
unknown
speaker
(
inaudible)
unknown
speaker
i
do
not
find
that
is
anything
can
decide
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
those
were
the
only
two
you
mentioned
in
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
they
eliminated
that.
unknown
speaker
all
there
are
some
disciplinary
procedures,
the
end
result
of
which
would
not
be
and
can
never
be
were
also
good-time?
unknown
speaker
i
think
they
were
--
unknown
speaker
suppose
where
one
is
not
accumulated
good
time
--
unknown
speaker
well,
i
gather
your
answer
to
me
is
there
is
a
risk
in
every
disciplinary
proceeding
where
there's
hearing
before
the
committee
that
one
may
either
lose
accumulated
good
time
or
risk
accumulation
in
the
future
of
good
time.
unknown
speaker
then
your
submission
is
we
got
to
treat
all
the
problems
raised
by
this
case
against
that
background.
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you,
what
is
the
very
first
step
in
nebraska
in
the
disciplinary
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
not
would
be,
is
--
there
is
--
this
is
the
existing
procedure.
unknown
speaker
that
is
the
procedure
which
you
think
doesn't
go
far
enough?
unknown
speaker
do
they
satisfy
constitutional
rights,
just
that
kind
of
an
informal
hearing.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
never
gets
to
disciplinary
committee
until
or
unless
the
correctional
officer
--.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
what
i
was
asking
about.
i
take
it
that
the
vast
majority
of
disciplinary
matters
are
resolved.
unknown
speaker
do
you
object
to
that
phase
of
the
--.
unknown
speaker
how
about
your
counsel
or
help
right?
are
you
going
to
say
that
make
a
representation
at
point
of
asked
to
plea
at
guilty?
unknown
speaker
but
if
the
prisoner
says,
yes,
i
did
do
that.
then
you
say
the
officer
disposes
off
it.
how
does
he
do
dispose
of
it?
unknown
speaker
but
what
if
he
says
--
does
he
have
the
power
to
put
him
in
solitary
confinement?
unknown
speaker
with
the
report
of
the
prisoner
has
admitted
the
matter?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
because
i
take
it
the
chief
correctional
officer
hasn't
got
the
power
to
impose
that
kind
of
punishment.
unknown
speaker
he
still
would
say
to
counsel
that
--
unknown
speaker
--
in
the
criminal
trials
when
you
are
getting
a
--
unknown
speaker
in
a
pre-sentence
report,
the
accused
does
participate
in
making.
unknown
speaker
they
don't
even
see
it.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
chief
correctional
officer
and
allow
him
to
say
anything
he
wants
to
say.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you
can
see
that
if
he
has
admitted
it
all
against
the
disciplinary
committee
is
the
correctional
office's
report
which
includes
the
admission,
perhaps,
without
violating
constitutional
guarantees
,
the
disciplinary
committee
may
impose
discipline
without
affording
him
any
kind
of
hearing?
unknown
speaker
so
if
at
that
time,
he
gets
there
and
he
would
say,
well,
what
the
correction
officer
report
states
is
true.
i
did
all
those
things.
that
would
be
the
end
of
it.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
if
he
said,
well,
look,
i
know
that's
so,
but
this
is
why,
then
you
ought
to
be
allowed
some
help.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
fundamental
difference
between
the
court
of
appeals
in
nebraska.
unknown
speaker
gagnon.
v.
scarpelli
did
not
apply
at
all.
unknown
speaker
that's
exactly
--
unknown
speaker
now
is
it
part
of
your
submission
that
in
those
instances
where
a
qualified
lawyer
is
not
the
required
but
a
counsel
substitute
is
that
nebraska
does
not
provide
an
adequate
substitute.
unknown
speaker
and
satisfies
the
due
process.
unknown
speaker
so
if
you
credit
the
testimony
and
then
state
within
your
brief,
in
a
vast
majority
of
the
situation
there
would
not
be
a
fact
finding
issue
anyway
--
unknown
speaker
this
chart
which
you
referred
appears
where?
unknown
speaker
of
what?
unknown
speaker
on
the
brief
of
the
respondent.
unknown
speaker
mine
only
goes
to
11a
and
that
goes
to
page
45.
unknown
speaker
13a
that
just
seems
to
--
unknown
speaker
it
has
like
a
lot
of
states,
50
states,
great
many
states
is
at
the
charge
sheet
on
that.
unknown
speaker
the
one
in
four
point
print.
alright
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
does
chart
come
in
the
size
as
you
have
it
well
in
the
review
size.
unknown
speaker
it
is
difficult
to
read.
unknown
speaker
is
that
practice
followed
generally
in
your
state.
does
he
sentencing
judge,
when
he
imposes
sentence
specify,
how
long
a
period
is
to
be
spent
in
solitary
confinement?
unknown
speaker
well,
its
pretty
much
with
that
letter
so
far

unknown

that's
not
the
ordinary

of

of
