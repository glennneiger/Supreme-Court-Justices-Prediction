this
case
comes
to
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
petitioner
has
brought
this
case,
challenging
certain
new
york
state
welfare
regulations
on
the
grounds
that
the
regulations
violated
equal
protection
clause
and
were
also
inconsistent
with
the
social
security
act
and
various
implementing
regulations.
they
ask
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
an
injunction.
a
single
district
judge
did
not
pass
on
the
constitutional
claim,
but
did
sustain
the
supremacy
clause
claim,
that
is
the
claim
that
the
regulations
were
in
conflict
with
federal
law.
the
court
appeals
reversed,
holding
that
the
constitutional
claim
was
not
substantial
and
that
therefore
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever
over
either
the
constitutional
claim
or
the
statutory
conflict
claim.
we
granted
the
petition
for
cert
and
we
now
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
the
constitutional
claim
was
sufficient
to
support
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
and
that
it
was
proper
for
the
single
district
judge
to
proceed,
to
consider
the
so
called
statutory
claim.
accordingly
the
judgment
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed.
mr.
justice
powell

filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
joined
