unknown
speaker
let
me
get
this
straight.
you
state
the
question
of
--
in
pendent
jurisdiction
terms,
tell
me
that
the
question
that
you
want
to
be
pendent.
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
why
do
you
need
to
resort
to
pendent
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
you
say
so
then?
unknown
speaker
when
do
you
call
that
pendent?
isn’t
that
a
federal
question
in
itself?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
you
say
it
was
a
pendent
claim.
but
it
isn’t
pendent
if
--
at
all,
is
it
if
you
don’t
need
a
constitutional
claim,
it
isn’t
pendent,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
then
if
you
need
a
constitutional
claim,
you
just
can’t
consider
whether
it’s
pendent
or
not.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
which
is
what?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
any
statutory,
any
statutory
claim,
any
claim
that
a
state
law
conflicts
with
a
federal
statute
in
order
to
be
--
is
pendent
to
the
constitutional
plan,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
if
there
is
a
constitutional
claim,
the
only
basis
for
considering
the
statutory
claim
was
pendent
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
but
what
--
but
do
you
mean
--
why
isn’t
that
a
constitutional
claim
in
itself
when
it’s
supremacy
clause?
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
it
is
for
the
purposes
of
a
three-judge
court
statute.
unknown
speaker
we
have
no
reason
but
we
can’t
strike
down
a
state
statute
except
for
the
constitutional
grounds,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
now
if
we
strike
it
down
because
it’s
in
conflict
with
the
federal
statute,
it’s
because
the
constitution
requires
it.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
federal
rights
whether
they
derive
from
the
constitution
of
federal
statutes
and
treaties
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
1983
reaches
all
of
those?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yet
the
payment
is
made
to
the
parent,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
feel
this
doesn’t
parse
itself
in
the
family
units
as
such.
you
want
to
keep
the
children
separate
and
distinct
from
some
instances
mismanaging
parents.
unknown
speaker
mr.
nathanson,
if
you
should
prevail
here
what
is
the
likely
result
in
the
new
york
system.
is
it
a
likelihood
that
they
will
then
do
away
with
advances
to
prevent
eviction?
unknown
speaker
who
pays
the
emergency
assistance
then?
unknown
speaker
let
me
go
back
to
my
question,
i
take
it’s
your
position
then
and
if
you
prevail
here
you
are
in
no
way
affecting
adversely
the
very
children
that
you’re
intending
to
benefit
by
being
here?
unknown
speaker
you
will
draw
it
up
--
other
sources
of
assistance?
unknown
speaker
oh!
i
must
say
i
then
misunderstand
wholly
what
this
case
is
about.
i
had
thought
that
if
you
prevailed
here,
all
that
would
happen
would
be
that
the
case
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
a
trial,
i
thought
this
was
only
was
only
a
jurisdictional
question
before
us
here.
unknown
speaker
and
the
only
questions
presented
as
i
read
them
in
your
brief
--
unknown
speaker
--
and
i
understood
them
in
reading
these
briefs
at
some
lengths,
i
assume
were
jurisdictional
questions.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
what
do
you
mean
if
you
prevail
here,
somebody
is
going
to
have
to
pay
some
money?
if
you
prevail
here
its
going
back
to
the
district
court
for
a
trial,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
its
not
here
--
unknown
speaker
all
we
have
here
is
jurisdictional
question.
unknown
speaker
unless
i
have
quite
misread
and
misunderstood
the
briefs.
unknown
speaker
but
--
well,
did
you
argue
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
under
1983
and
1343
a
supremacy
clause
argument
namely
a
claim
that
a
state
statute
is
in
conflict
with
a
federal
statute
and
therefore
invalid.
would
you
argue
that
that
kind
of
a
claim
is
a
constitutional
claim
within
the
meaning
of
1983?
unknown
speaker
well,
again,
how
about
answering
that
--
the
question,
did
you
argue
that
or
not
that
this
conflict
supremacy
matter
was
a
constitutional
claim
within
the
meaning
of
1983?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
care
about
the
lower
court
--
unknown
speaker
the
jurisdiction
was
challenged
in
the
court
of
appeals,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
hold?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
the
decision
you’re
wanting
to
be
reviewed
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
argue
in
response
to
the
state’s
claim
that
there
is
a
constitutional
issue
here
namely
one
of
supremacy?
did
you
argue
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
--
your
very
opening
sentence
of
your
complaint
at
page
4
is
that
you
seek
a
declaration,
the
title
18
of
the
new
york
code
is
in
violation
of
social
security
act
and
in
also
the
equal
protection
clause.
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
that
first
sentence
mean?
if
it’s
in
violation
of
the
social
security
act,
and
isn’t
that
a
supremacy
clause
allegation?
unknown
speaker
we’re
arguing
on
your
side
right
now,
if
you
remember
that?[laughter]
do
you
know
of
any
cases
in
this
court
that
say
that
a
substantial
supremacy
clause
argument
is
not
a
constitutional
question
within
the
meaning
of
1983?
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
assume
that
it
is,
isn’t
this
case
over?
unknown
speaker
it
should.
unknown
speaker
mr.
nathanson,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
is
the
only
reason
that
the
title
28
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1331
inapplicable
here
because
of
the
one
of
the
requisite
jurisdictional
amount?
unknown
speaker
do
you
understand
my
question?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
only
reason?
excuse
me.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
your
submission,
why
is
it
that
you
have
to
argue
about
1343
(3)
and
(4),
wouldn’t
1331
be
available
to
you?
unknown
speaker
well
then
the
answer
to
my
first
question
is
yes?
that’s
the
reason
and
the
only
reason?
unknown
speaker
right.
because
of
the
jurisdictional
amount?
unknown
speaker
because
that
never
came
through
too
clearly.
i
guess
it’s
implicit
all
through
these
briefs.
that’s
the
sole
reason
for
it
that
1331
is
not
available.
unknown
speaker
right,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
nathanson
are
you
familiar
with
the
treatment,
in
the
opinions
in
the
rachel
and/or
peacock
cases
of
almost
identical
language
in
the
removal
statutes?
unknown
speaker
where
it
was
held,
as
i
remember,
that
an
act
of
congress
providing
for
equal
rights
of
citizens
meant
just
that,
meant
what
it
said,
it
didn’t
mean
any
act
of
congress
or
any
constitutional
provision
either.
unknown
speaker
my
question
was
whether
--
were
you
familiar
with
the
language
in
peacock
v.
greenwood?
that
was
my
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
first,
would
you
--
yes
you
are
familiar
with
that
language.
unknown
speaker
do
i
recollect
correctly
that
it
was
held
in
those
cases
that
similar
or
identical
language
meant
legislation
providing
for
equal
rights,
it
didn’t
even
include,
for
example,
the
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
and
now
how
would
you
distinguish
that?
unknown
speaker
removal
statute.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
1983,
i
was
referring
to
1343
(3).
unknown
speaker
is
the
language
of
1343
(3)
the
relevant
language,
substantially
identical
with
that
of
the
removal
statute
dealt
with
in
rachel
and
peacock?
unknown
speaker
without
a
merit.
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
explain
to
me
it
happen
likely
--
why
they
claim
that
the
state,
that
statute
violates
the
federal
statute
is
to
be
a
substantial
constitutional
question
in
itself
under
--
within
the
meaning
of
1983
and
1343?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
all
of
our
cases
–
the
first
amendment
rights
are
covered
by
1983?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
fourteenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
in
a
way
--
your
short
answer
is
that
just
like
construction
of
1983
at
this
--
the
constitutional
claim
its
referring
to
are
more
limited
than
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
and
then
certainly
it
doesn’t
include
supremacy
clause
point.
unknown
speaker
i
wouldn’t
think
so
if
you
could
be
constantly
be
asserting
that
claim
is
of
a
federal
statute,
that
a
state
might
be
in
very
--
without
having
a
state
statute
be
in
conflict.
unknown
speaker
well,
again,
do
you
know
of
any
cases
that
deal
expressly
with
this
issue?
unknown
speaker
but
that
issue
is
here,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
that
the
jurisdiction
--
if
we’re
dealing
with
jurisdiction,
i
suppose
we
have
some
freedom
that
we
normally
don’t
have
in
terms
of
issues.
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
issue
is
here
or
is
open,
as
far
as
you
know,
it
would
be
the
first
time
that
this
court
has
ever
decided
that
the
supremacy
clause
issue
is
not
a
constitutional
issue
within
the
meaning
of
1983
and
1343.
unknown
speaker
it
was
swift
versus
wickham.
unknown
speaker
2281,
that
is
--
unknown
speaker
that’s
swift
against
wickham.
unknown
speaker
with
three-judge
court?
unknown
speaker
why
couldn’t
this
action
have
been
brought
under
1331?
unknown
speaker
that’s
the
only
reason?
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
a
right
arising
out
of
the
federal
statute,
if
you
bring
a
declaratory
--
to
have
a
state
statute
stricken
down?
what
kind
of
a
1331
claim
is
that?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
which?
unknown
speaker
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
let
me
frame
it
for
you.
the
complaint
says
the
state
statute
says
so
and
so.
the
federal
statute
says
so
and
so.
i
want
a
declaratory
judgment
action
that
the
state
statute
is
unconstitutional.
because
--
unknown
speaker
--
it
is
in
conflict
with
the
federal
statute.
unknown
speaker
now,
is
that
a
constitutional
claim
or
is
it
just
a
claim
under
a
federal
statute.
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
has
to
have
constitutional
authority
to
strike
down
the
state
statute.
unknown
speaker
why?
why
is
that?
why
is
it
then
that
federal
statute
prevail?
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
be,
isn’t
it?[laughter]
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
household
finances?
well,
this
is
the
question
i
asked
your
opponent
of
course
and
he
rather
brushed
it
aside
by
saying
that
there
were
other
emergency
measures
that
could
be
utilized
by
the
state,
do
you
disagree
with
his
answer?
unknown
speaker
mr.
colodner,
was
the
argument
made
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
that’s
being
made
here
that,
i.e.
that
quite
apart
from
what's
been
called
here
pendent
jurisdiction
that
there
is
independent
jurisdiction
of
this
so-called
statutory
claim,
this
preemption
claim
under
1343
(3)
and
1343
(4)?
unknown
speaker
because
i’ve
just
--
that
i
have
a
probably
hear
a
judge
hays’
opinion
and
he
seems
to
say
that
the
basic
constitutional
claim
was
premised
upon
that
jurisdictional
statute,
1343
(3)
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say
it
was
established
jurisdiction
under
this
statute
and
substantial
to
constitutional
claim
must
be
advanced
and
then
he
says
for
the
reasons
that
you
just
told
us,
this
equal
protection
claim
was
not
a
substantial
constitutional
claim.
and
then
he
ends
very
abruptly
because
no
substantial
constitutional
claim
was
presented.
the
district
court
was
without
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
statutory
claim
urged
by
the
plaintiffs.
the
statutory
presumably
being
the
preemption
claim.
now,
was
--
which
doesn’t
seem
to
respond
to
--
at
least
to
the
argument
that
is
being
made
in
this
court
with
respect
to
the
independent
grounds
for
jurisdiction
of
the
so-called
statutory
claim?
unknown
speaker
i
wonder
if
the
argument
is
made
to
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
apparently
just
accepted
it
without
--
unknown
speaker
without
any
analysis,
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
i
am
--
do
i
--
unknown
speaker
as
they
--
the
court
took
the
view
that
once
they
had
decided
the
constitutional
claim
was
not
a
substantial
one.
then
what
they
call
the
statutory
claim
automatically
fell
with
it
without
any
consideration
at
all
of
any
independent
jurisdictional
basis
for
the
so-called
statutory
claim,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
this
precise
argument
i
gather
from
what
you
say
was
not
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
--
unknown
speaker
or
at
least
not
in
the
way
it’s
being
presented
here,
is
that
fair
to
say?
unknown
speaker
and
unless
that
were
pendent
to
a
substantial
constitutional
claim?
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
wholly
accepted
your
thesis.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
let
me
get
this
straight.
you
state
the
question
of
--
in
pendent
jurisdiction
terms,
tell
me
that
the
question
that
you
want
to
be
pendent.
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
why
do
you
need
to
resort
to
pendent
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
you
say
so
then?
unknown
speaker
when
do
you
call
that
pendent?
isn’t
that
a
federal
question
in
itself?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
you
say
it
was
a
pendent
claim.
but
it
isn’t
pendent
if
--
at
all,
is
it
if
you
don’t
need
a
constitutional
claim,
it
isn’t
pendent,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
and
then
if
you
need
a
constitutional
claim,
you
just
can’t
consider
whether
it’s
pendent
or
not.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
which
is
what?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
any
statutory,
any
statutory
claim,
any
claim
that
a
state
law
conflicts
with
a
federal
statute
in
order
to
be
--
is
pendent
to
the
constitutional
plan,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
if
there
is
a
constitutional
claim,
the
only
basis
for
considering
the
statutory
claim
was
pendent
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
but
what
--
but
do
you
mean
--
why
isn’t
that
a
constitutional
claim
in
itself
when
it’s
supremacy
clause?
unknown
speaker
but
you
said
it
is
for
the
purposes
of
a
three-judge
court
statute.
unknown
speaker
we
have
no
reason
but
we
can’t
strike
down
a
state
statute
except
for
the
constitutional
grounds,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
now
if
we
strike
it
down
because
it’s
in
conflict
with
the
federal
statute,
it’s
because
the
constitution
requires
it.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
federal
rights
whether
they
derive
from
the
constitution
of
federal
statutes
and
treaties
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
1983
reaches
all
of
those?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yet
the
payment
is
made
to
the
parent,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
do
you
feel
this
doesn’t
parse
itself
in
the
family
units
as
such.
you
want
to
keep
the
children
separate
and
distinct
from
some
instances
mismanaging
parents.
unknown
speaker
mr.
nathanson,
if
you
should
prevail
here
what
is
the
likely
result
in
the
new
york
system.
is
it
a
likelihood
that
they
will
then
do
away
with
advances
to
prevent
eviction?
unknown
speaker
who
pays
the
emergency
assistance
then?
unknown
speaker
let
me
go
back
to
my
question,
i
take
it’s
your
position
then
and
if
you
prevail
here
you
are
in
no
way
affecting
adversely
the
very
children
that
you’re
intending
to
benefit
by
being
here?
unknown
speaker
you
will
draw
it
up
--
other
sources
of
assistance?
unknown
speaker
oh!
i
must
say
i
then
misunderstand
wholly
what
this
case
is
about.
i
had
thought
that
if
you
prevailed
here,
all
that
would
happen
would
be
that
the
case
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
a
trial,
i
thought
this
was
only
was
only
a
jurisdictional
question
before
us
here.
unknown
speaker
and
the
only
questions
presented
as
i
read
them
in
your
brief
--
unknown
speaker
--
and
i
understood
them
in
reading
these
briefs
at
some
lengths,
i
assume
were
jurisdictional
questions.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
what
do
you
mean
if
you
prevail
here,
somebody
is
going
to
have
to
pay
some
money?
if
you
prevail
here
its
going
back
to
the
district
court
for
a
trial,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
its
not
here
--
unknown
speaker
all
we
have
here
is
jurisdictional
question.
unknown
speaker
unless
i
have
quite
misread
and
misunderstood
the
briefs.
unknown
speaker
but
--
well,
did
you
argue
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
under
1983
and
1343
a
supremacy
clause
argument
namely
a
claim
that
a
state
statute
is
in
conflict
with
a
federal
statute
and
therefore
invalid.
would
you
argue
that
that
kind
of
a
claim
is
a
constitutional
claim
within
the
meaning
of
1983?
unknown
speaker
well,
again,
how
about
answering
that
--
the
question,
did
you
argue
that
or
not
that
this
conflict
supremacy
matter
was
a
constitutional
claim
within
the
meaning
of
1983?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
care
about
the
lower
court
--
unknown
speaker
the
jurisdiction
was
challenged
in
the
court
of
appeals,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
hold?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
the
decision
you’re
wanting
to
be
reviewed
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
argue
in
response
to
the
state’s
claim
that
there
is
a
constitutional
issue
here
namely
one
of
supremacy?
did
you
argue
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
--
your
very
opening
sentence
of
your
complaint
at
page
4
is
that
you
seek
a
declaration,
the
title
18
of
the
new
york
code
is
in
violation
of
social
security
act
and
in
also
the
equal
protection
clause.
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
that
first
sentence
mean?
if
it’s
in
violation
of
the
social
security
act,
and
isn’t
that
a
supremacy
clause
allegation?
unknown
speaker
we’re
arguing
on
your
side
right
now,
if
you
remember
that?[laughter]
do
you
know
of
any
cases
in
this
court
that
say
that
a
substantial
supremacy
clause
argument
is
not
a
constitutional
question
within
the
meaning
of
1983?
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
assume
that
it
is,
isn’t
this
case
over?
unknown
speaker
it
should.
unknown
speaker
mr.
nathanson,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
is
the
only
reason
that
the
title
28
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1331
inapplicable
here
because
of
the
one
of
the
requisite
jurisdictional
amount?
unknown
speaker
do
you
understand
my
question?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
only
reason?
excuse
me.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
your
submission,
why
is
it
that
you
have
to
argue
about
1343
(3)
and
(4),
wouldn’t
1331
be
available
to
you?
unknown
speaker
well
then
the
answer
to
my
first
question
is
yes?
that’s
the
reason
and
the
only
reason?
unknown
speaker
right.
because
of
the
jurisdictional
amount?
unknown
speaker
because
that
never
came
through
too
clearly.
i
guess
it’s
implicit
all
through
these
briefs.
that’s
the
sole
reason
for
it
that
1331
is
not
available.
unknown
speaker
right,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
nathanson
are
you
familiar
with
the
treatment,
in
the
opinions
in
the
rachel
and/or
peacock
cases
of
almost
identical
language
in
the
removal
statutes?
unknown
speaker
where
it
was
held,
as
i
remember,
that
an
act
of
congress
providing
for
equal
rights
of
citizens
meant
just
that,
meant
what
it
said,
it
didn’t
mean
any
act
of
congress
or
any
constitutional
provision
either.
unknown
speaker
my
question
was
whether
--
were
you
familiar
with
the
language
in
peacock
v.
greenwood?
that
was
my
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
first,
would
you
--
yes
you
are
familiar
with
that
language.
unknown
speaker
do
i
recollect
correctly
that
it
was
held
in
those
cases
that
similar
or
identical
language
meant
legislation
providing
for
equal
rights,
it
didn’t
even
include,
for
example,
the
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
and
now
how
would
you
distinguish
that?
unknown
speaker
removal
statute.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
1983,
i
was
referring
to
1343
(3).
unknown
speaker
is
the
language
of
1343
(3)
the
relevant
language,
substantially
identical
with
that
of
the
removal
statute
dealt
with
in
rachel
and
peacock?
unknown
speaker
without
a
merit.
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
well,
explain
to
me
it
happen
likely
--
why
they
claim
that
the
state,
that
statute
violates
the
federal
statute
is
to
be
a
substantial
constitutional
question
in
itself
under
--
within
the
meaning
of
1983
and
1343?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
all
of
our
cases
–
the
first
amendment
rights
are
covered
by
1983?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
fourteenth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
that
in
a
way
--
your
short
answer
is
that
just
like
construction
of
1983
at
this
--
the
constitutional
claim
its
referring
to
are
more
limited
than
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
and
then
certainly
it
doesn’t
include
supremacy
clause
point.
unknown
speaker
i
wouldn’t
think
so
if
you
could
be
constantly
be
asserting
that
claim
is
of
a
federal
statute,
that
a
state
might
be
in
very
--
without
having
a
state
statute
be
in
conflict.
unknown
speaker
well,
again,
do
you
know
of
any
cases
that
deal
expressly
with
this
issue?
unknown
speaker
but
that
issue
is
here,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
that
the
jurisdiction
--
if
we’re
dealing
with
jurisdiction,
i
suppose
we
have
some
freedom
that
we
normally
don’t
have
in
terms
of
issues.
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
issue
is
here
or
is
open,
as
far
as
you
know,
it
would
be
the
first
time
that
this
court
has
ever
decided
that
the
supremacy
clause
issue
is
not
a
constitutional
issue
within
the
meaning
of
1983
and
1343.
unknown
speaker
it
was
swift
versus
wickham.
unknown
speaker
2281,
that
is
--
unknown
speaker
that’s
swift
against
wickham.
unknown
speaker
with
three-judge
court?
unknown
speaker
why
couldn’t
this
action
have
been
brought
under
1331?
unknown
speaker
that’s
the
only
reason?
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
a
right
arising
out
of
the
federal
statute,
if
you
bring
a
declaratory
--
to
have
a
state
statute
stricken
down?
what
kind
of
a
1331
claim
is
that?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
which?
unknown
speaker
well,
(voice
overlap)
--
unknown
speaker
let
me
frame
it
for
you.
the
complaint
says
the
state
statute
says
so
and
so.
the
federal
statute
says
so
and
so.
i
want
a
declaratory
judgment
action
that
the
state
statute
is
unconstitutional.
because
--
unknown
speaker
--
it
is
in
conflict
with
the
federal
statute.
unknown
speaker
now,
is
that
a
constitutional
claim
or
is
it
just
a
claim
under
a
federal
statute.
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
has
to
have
constitutional
authority
to
strike
down
the
state
statute.
unknown
speaker
why?
why
is
that?
why
is
it
then
that
federal
statute
prevail?
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
be,
isn’t
it?[laughter]
unknown
speaker
(inaudible).
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
household
finances?
well,
this
is
the
question
i
asked
your
opponent
of
course
and
he
rather
brushed
it
aside
by
saying
that
there
were
other
emergency
measures
that
could
be
utilized
by
the
state,
do
you
disagree
with
his
answer?
unknown
speaker
mr.
colodner,
was
the
argument
made
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
that’s
being
made
here
that,
i.e.
that
quite
apart
from
what's
been
called
here
pendent
jurisdiction
that
there
is
independent
jurisdiction
of
this
so-called
statutory
claim,
this
preemption
claim
under
1343
(3)
and
1343
(4)?
unknown
speaker
because
i’ve
just
--
that
i
have
a
probably
hear
a
judge
hays’
opinion
and
he
seems
to
say
that
the
basic
constitutional
claim
was
premised
upon
that
jurisdictional
statute,
1343
(3)
and
then
he
goes
on
to
say
it
was
established
jurisdiction
under
this
statute
and
substantial
to
constitutional
claim
must
be
advanced
and
then
he
says
for
the
reasons
that
you
just
told
us,
this
equal
protection
claim
was
not
a
substantial
constitutional
claim.
and
then
he
ends
very
abruptly
because
no
substantial
constitutional
claim
was
presented.
the
district
court
was
without
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
statutory
claim
urged
by
the
plaintiffs.
the
statutory
presumably
being
the
preemption
claim.
now,
was
--
which
doesn’t
seem
to
respond
to
--
at
least
to
the
argument
that
is
being
made
in
this
court
with
respect
to
the
independent
grounds
for
jurisdiction
of
the
so-called
statutory
claim?
unknown
speaker
i
wonder
if
the
argument
is
made
to
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
apparently
just
accepted
it
without
--
unknown
speaker
without
any
analysis,
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
i
am
--
do
i
--
unknown
speaker
as
they
--
the
court
took
the
view
that
once
they
had
decided
the
constitutional
claim
was
not
a
substantial
one.
then
what
they
call
the
statutory
claim
automatically
fell
with
it
without
any
consideration
at
all
of
any
independent
jurisdictional
basis
for
the
so-called
statutory
claim,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
this
precise
argument
i
gather
from
what
you
say
was
not
presented
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
--
unknown
speaker
or
at
least
not
in
the
way
it’s
being
presented
here,
is
that
fair
to
say?
unknown
speaker
and
unless
that
were
pendent
to
a
substantial
constitutional
claim?
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
wholly
accepted
your
thesis.
unknown
speaker
right.
