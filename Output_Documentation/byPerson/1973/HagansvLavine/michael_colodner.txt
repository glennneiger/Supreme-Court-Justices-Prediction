mr.
michael
colodner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
regulation
of
the
new
york
state
department
of
social
services
in
which
the
state
makes
an
additional
rent
payment
to
welfare
recipient
that
is
over
and
above
the
regular
shelter
allowance
which
that
recipient
would
recede
and
then
recoup
it
over
a
period
of
six
months.
the
requirements
for
this
regulation
is
that
the
recipient
for
whatever
reason
misallocate
his
or
her
regular
shelter
allowance.
the
recipient
then
becomes
threatened
with
the
eviction.
the
department
then
steps
in
at
the
request
of
the
recipient
and
offers
them
an
opportunity
to
remain
where
they
are
living
and
therefore
receive
a
duplicate
rent
payment.
but
if
they
choose
this
option,
they
will
have
to
repay
this
extra
amount
over
the
course
of
the
next
six
months.
now,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
challenged
this
because
they
claimed
there’s
a
denial
of
equal
protection
because
those
who
are
subject
to
recoupment
are
in
some
matter
being
treated
differently
from
those
who
are
not
subject
to
this
recoupment
even
though
this
other
class
never
received
the
extra
payment.
the
second
circuit
found
this
claim
to
be
insubstantial
and
as
such
found
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
pendent
statutory
claim
which
involves
whether
the
new
york
state
regulation
at
issue
violates
the
social
security
act.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
would
suggest
your
honor
that
the
1983
and
1343
deal
with
a
specific
amendment.
it
deals
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
it’s
the
civil
right
statute.
the
wording
of
those
statutes
are
such
that
it
deals
with
rights
protected
by
constitution
and
laws
or
laws
protecting
equal
rights.
if
your
honors,
interpretation
of
--
mr.
michael
colodner
first
amendment
rights
would
probably
be
covered
by
1983.
mr.
michael
colodner
well,
it
depends
on
how
it
is
and
how
broadly
you
would
read
1983.
1983
was
passed
specifically
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
is
not
a
self
executing
amendment.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
michael
colodner
i
would
suggest
that
at
any
event
it
could
not
include
the
supremacy
clause
because
there
would
be
no
reason
for
congress
to
put
in
jurisdiction
and
laws
protecting
equal
rights
if
in
fact
the
constitution
included
the
whole
kind
of
federal
laws.
mr.
michael
colodner
yes,
that
is
correct.
but
i
would
think
that
in
terms
of
what
congress
meant
when
they
established
jurisdiction
to
get
claims
under
the
constitution
using
the
supremacy
clause
argument,
they
established
1331
which
is
the
general
federal
question
jurisdiction
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
colodner
i
do
not
know
of
any
cases
which
deal
with
this
issue.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
don’t
believe
it's
here
because
it
was
never
raised
by
the
--
mr.
michael
colodner
that
could
be
your
honor.
mr.
michael
colodner
this
court
has
never
really
decided
that
type
of
issue
at
all.
i
am
aware
of
the
decision.
i
think
it
was
last
year,
it
was
dealt
with
the
three-judge
court
statute
which
--
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
of
course
that’s
–
than
last
year,
which
held
that
if
my
recollection
is
correct
that
the
supremacy
clause
does
not
include
within
this
three-judge
court
--
mr.
michael
colodner
2281,
that’s
correct.
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
correct.
mr.
michael
colodner
but
insofar
as
what
the
question
that
your
honor
has
brought
if
i
am
not
aware
of
any
cases
that
it's
ever
reached
that
question.
i
point
out
that
in
this
case
--
mr.
michael
colodner
because
there
is
no
monetary
amount
to
$10,000.00
in
dispute
at
least
--
mr.
michael
colodner
it
would
seem
to
me
that
you
can
always
bring
a
claim.
1331
is
general
federal
question
jurisdiction.
this
is
a
claim
arising
out
of
the
federal
statute.
it’s
the
--
1331
says
arising
out
of
federal
statutes,
there’d
be
no
reason
why
it
couldn’t
be
brought.
mr.
michael
colodner
it’s
a
right
--
mr.
michael
colodner
it’s
a
right
arising
under
the
constitution
or
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
michael
colodner
depends
on
how
the
plaintiffs
might
claim
--
mr.
michael
colodner
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
michael
colodner
i
think
--
mr.
michael
colodner
well
--
mr.
michael
colodner
i
think
that
presupposes
your
initial
question
as
where
does
constitutionality
come
in
to
this
with
the
supremacy,
--
where
the
supremacy
--
mr.
michael
colodner
i
would
think
that
if
a
federal
statute,
if
a
state
statute
conflicted
with
the
federal
statute.
mr.
michael
colodner
well,
that
would
be
the
supremacy
clause
--
mr.
michael
colodner
i
think
if
you
go
back
to
the
history
of
the
civil
rights
act
here,
there
was
no
indication
that
it
was
ever
meant
to
include
this
type
of
broad
colloquy
of
including
every
single
state
law
that
is
perhaps
contrary
to
every
single
federal
law.
there
is
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
civil
rights
act
that
leads
to
that
conclusion.
and
while
you
can
make
a
verbal
argument
to
that
effect,
i
don’t
think
that
the
history
bears
it
out.
now
insofar
as
the
--
mr.
michael
colodner
i
think
your
honor
that
if
you
take
the
cases
in
the
last
four
or
five
years
that
there
really
is
not
a
conflict
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
some
dicta
in
one
or
two
cases.
because
1983,
lets
get
right
into
1983,
the
claim
of
the
petitioners
here
is
that
it
provides
a
remedy
for
all
federal
statute
and
they
look
to
the
language
which
says,
“all
rights
are
secured
by
constitution
and
laws.”
and
they
claim
laws
include
a
social
security
act
and
therefore
they
have
a
right
to
come
into
federal
court
to
--
at
least
allege
a
federal
cause
of
action
under
1983.
but
the
1871
act,
which
is
the
basis
for
1983
did
not
mention
rights
secured
by
laws.
it
only
mentioned
rights
secured
by
the
constitution.
the
change
that
occurred
in
1871
act
came
during
the
revision
when
the
1866,
1870,
1871
acts
were
all
codified
together
and
clarified
and
put
into
one
provision.
and
here
the
reviser
put
in
the
words,
“and
laws.”
and
i
think
that
since
there
is
no
explanation
as
to
why
the
reviser
put
this
in.
it
would
appear
that
he
was
referring
to
the
laws
that
were
included
in
that
whole
civil
rights
package
which
were
in
essence
the
1866
civil
rights
act
and
the
1870
civil
rights
act.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
history
of
the
civil
rights
act
that
congress
ever
intended
to
create
a
federal
cause
of
action
for
every
conceivable
federal
statute
that
would
ever
come
into
existence
aside
from
statutes
that
enforce
the
thirteenth
to
fourteenth
and
the
fifteenth
amendments.
in
fact,
the
only
supreme
court
case
that
ever
considered
this
issue
as
to
what
the
scope
of
“and
laws”
what
was
a
1900
supreme
court
case
and
it
held
that
this
language
did
not
apply
at
least
to
a
patent
rights
case,
holding
that
1983
applied
to
civil
rights
only,
at
least
showing
that
the
supreme
court
in
1900
believed
that
1983
was
a
failing
narrow
statute.
now
when
this
court
has
spoken
of
1983
in
terms
of
the
rights
that
it
protects,
it
has
spoken
of
protection
of
constitutional
rights.
and
this
court
has
never
held
1983
to
its
literal
language
as
witnessed
in
the
case
of
tenney
versus
brandhove.
i
think
it
is
important
to
note,
that
when
congress
passes
a
federal
statute
they
generally
provide
their
own
remedy
within
the
statute.
the
social
security
act
when
it
was
passed
provided
no
remedy
in
federal
court
for
recipients
of
afdc
benefits.
and
i
would
suggest
that
there
was
no
reason
why
congress
which
always
provides
its
own
remedies
when
it
passes
any
new
statute
would
pass
a
statute
which
creates
a
federal
cause
of
action
as
to
every
conceivable
future
federal
law
in
any
field
whatever,
banking,
tax,
it
makes
no
difference
simply
because
state
action
might
be
involved.
there
was
just
no
reason
why
congress
would
pass
this
statute
and
there
is
no
reason
to
give
the
language
of
“
and
laws
“
in
1983,
the
broad
interpretation
that
petitioners
want
to
give
and
that
this
court
has
stated
in
dicta
might
apply.
i
would
suggest
that
even
if
1983
is
as
broad
as
petitioner
say
it
is
and
if
it
includes
every
single
federal
law,
it
is
clear
that
congress
did
not
provide
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
to
hear
this
course
of
action
because
the
language
of
1343
(3)
is
narrow.
it
says
deprivation
of
rights
secured
by
the
constitution
and
if
any
act
of
congress
providing
the
equal
rights.
now
the
history
of
that
clause
is
also
very
unclear.
in
the
1874
codification
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
over
rights
secured
by
any
law,
the
circuit
court
on
the
other
hand
had
rights
secured
by
any
law
providing
for
equal
rights.
these
were
probably
meant
to
be
concurrent
because
the
basis
of
this
was
the
same
the
1866
act
which
did
provide
concurrent
jurisdiction.
i
have
shown
it
in
my
brief
that
this
address
was
note
on
the
circuit
court
provision
that
chose
it
was
intended
to
be
narrowly
applied
to
equal
rights
statutes.
and
in
1911,
congress
explicitly
shows
the
equal
rights
language
which
shows
a
clear
intent
of
congress
that
it
at
least
believed
that
the
original
jurisdiction
was
limited
to
equal
rights
provisions.
now
it
is
very
interesting
that
the
petitioners
have
come
to
this
court
and
it
really
changed
the
whole
thrust
of
their
argument
because
in
the
lower
courts
they
were
arguing
at
the
social
security
act,
was
the
act
of
congress
providing
for
equal
rights
or
the
act
of
congress
providing
for
civil
rights?
now
they’ve
changed
the
argument.
they
say
that
1983
itself
is
such
an
act.
and
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
really
bootstraps
argument
because
1983
is
a
procedural
statute.
it
creates
a
cause
of
action
where
someone
is
deprived
of
rights
that
are
enumerated
somewhere
else.
it
is
in
the
words
of
1343.
the
civil
action
authorized
by
law
to
be
commenced.
that’s
right
on
the
first
line
of
1343.
it
is
not
the
act,
the
substantive
act
providing
for
equal
rights.
if
in
fact
1983
were
an
equal
rights
act,
there’d
be
a
lot
of
problems
just
on
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
number
one,
it
would
be
inconsistent
to
say
that
1983
is
the
authorizing
law
and
at
the
same
is
a
substantive
law.
number
two,
you'd
have
a
complete
redundancy
here
if
1983
is
an
equal
rights
act
because
1343
(3)
refers
to
rights
secured
by
the
constitution,
which
means
that
the
language
of
1343
(3)
would
be
redundant
if
it
includes
1983
which
already
refers
to
rights
secured
by
the
constitution.
all
congress
would
need
to
have
done
would
just
be
to
say
there
is
jurisdiction
under
any
equal
rights
statute.
there’d
be
no
reason
even
to
mention
constitution
if
1983
is
brought
down
into
the
jurisdictional
provision.
and
thirdly,
i
would
say
incongruously
if
1983
is
an
equal
rights
act,
its
language
and
laws
is
much
too
broad
to
encompass
itself
within
that
narrow
definition.
i
think
the
key
to
this
case
is
the
decision
in
georgia
versus
rachel.
because
they
are
dealing
with
the
same
language
in
the
removal
statute
this
court
held
that
the
term
any
law
providing
for
equal
rights
was
narrow.
it
meant
laws
dealing
with
historic
equal
rights
and
specifically
said,
it
did
not
mean
1983.
that’s
within
the
language
of
that
opinion
and
i
think
its
very
interesting
to
note
that
both
1443,
which
is
the
removal
statute
and
1343
(3)
which
is
the
statute
at
issue
here
derive
from
the
same
provision
of
the
1866
civil
rights
act,
which
is
subsection
3,
the
very
same
provision.
it
would
seem
that
if
1443
was
that
narrow,
1983
which
was
codified,
the
exact
same
year
as
1443
must
have
the
same
meaning.
i
would
also
suggest
that
if
congress
was
so
concerned
about
passing
1343
(4)
ninety
years
later
just
to
add
the
right
to
vote.
they
evidently
also
considered
the
phrase,
equal
rights
to
have
a
very
narrow
meaning.
and
in
fact,
i
would
point
out
that
the
history
of
1343
(3)
shows
that
the
“and
laws”
language
of
1983
was
probably
meant
to
be
more
limited
than
this
court
had
hinted
it
might
be.
now,
the
petitioners
also
argue
that
somehow
rather
in
1957,
congress
passed
a
new
jurisdictional
provision
to
the
civil
rights
act,
1343
(4)
which
somehow
changed
the
course
of
all
civil
rights
jurisdiction.
the
jurisdictional
provision
there
is
an
act
of
congress
providing
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights
including
the
right
to
vote.
well,
what
does
this
really
mean?
civil
rights
including
the
right
to
vote.
and
if
you
look
to
see
what
congress
was
really
trying
to
do
here,
you’ll
see
essentially
that
what
was
at
stake
in
1957
was
a
voting
rights
act.
the
house
report
called
this
particular
provision
as
a
technical
amendment.
the
house
debate
only
dealt
with
what
they
called
civil
rights
and
specifically
included
by
rulings
of
the
house
chairman,
economic
rights
of
which
we
are
obviously
dealing
with
here.
the
senate
debate
is
even
more
interesting
because
it
limits
itself
solely
to
voting
rights
because
of
a
very
strong
reaction
on
the
part
of
those
senators
favoring
state's
rights,
that
this
particular
vote
civil
rights
act
of
1957
might
be
too
broad
because
historically
this
would
be
the
first
civil
rights
act
that
was
passed
since
reconstruction.
the
provision
to
keep
in
this
--
what
became
1343
(4)
was
proposed
by
a
similar
case
of
south
dakota.
and
he
throughout
the
debates
states
that
the
reason
he
wants
this
provision
in
is
because
it
deals
wholly
and
he
says
that
wholly
with
the
establishment
of
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
toward
the
state
suits
relating
to
the
right
to
vote
and
just
the
right
to
vote.
i
think
that
what
you
have
here
with
1343
(4)
is
a
act
which
creates
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
to
hear
suits
relating
to
the
right
to
vote.
congress
was
very
uncertain
as
to
what
the
jurisdictional
limits
of
1343
(3)
were.
and
they
were
clarifying
it.
in
fact
the
caption
is
very
interesting
here.
the
caption
of
1343
just
says
civil
rights.
when
this
caption
--
when
1343
(4)
was
added
in
1957,
the
caption
was
amended
to
say
civil
rights
and
elective
franchise.
that
was
all
that
was
added.
so
what
you
have
here
essentially
when
you
deal
with
civil
rights
in
1343
(4)
is
the
same
rights
that
were
in
1343
(3)
except
that
it
includes
the
right
to
vote.
now,
it
is
true
that
1343
(4)
does
not
include
--
mr.
michael
colodner
whether
i
think
it
or
whether
the
congress
thought
so?
mr.
michael
colodner
i
don’t
believe
that
congress
felt
sure
whether
it
did
or
whether
it
did
not.
and
they
want
--
since
they
were
dealing
in
the
civil
rights
act,
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
there
would
be
no
jurisdictional
contradiction
in
the
statutes
between
the
jurisdiction
set
forth
in
1343
and
the
jurisdiction
provided
in
--
mr.
michael
colodner
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
correct.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
would
think
your
honor
--
mr.
michael
colodner
your
honor,
i
would
think
that
whether
--
mr.
michael
colodner
the
fifteenth
amendment
your
honors
provides
for
the
right
to
vote.
but
congress
wasn’t
very
concerned
about
the
fact
that
what
did
equal
rights
statute
mean?
and
also
1343
(4)
provides
a
right
of
action
not
under
color
of
state
law.
because
1971,
the
voting
rights
act
was
amended
provided
for
the
attorney
general
to
bring
suits
against
private
individuals
acting
under
color
of
state
law
or
not
under
color
of
state
law.
and
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
had
to
put
in
some
different
provision
to
allow
for
these
suits
to
be
brought
in
federal
court
without
a
jurisdictional
amount
not
under
color
of
state
law.
but
i
don’t
believe
there's
anything
in
the
history
of
1343
(4)
which
suggests
that
the
subject
matter
of
the
civil
rights
act
was
being
expanded
anymore
than
the
debates
indicated.
i
would
suggest
that
the
rights
of
1343
(4)
are
no
greater
than
the
rights
of
1343
(3).
and
that
congress
never
intended
that
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
suits
that
arise
under
the
afdc
provisions
of
the
social
security
act.
it’s
very
interesting
that
when
the
social
security
act
was
passed
in
1935,
there
was
jurisdiction
provided
in
the
federal
courts
for
claims
arising
under
the
old
age
provisions
but
not
under
the
aid
to
dependent
children
provision.
this
evidences
and
intends
on
the
part
of
congress
that
the
federal
courts
were
not
going
to
hear
every
single
minor,
afdc
claim
outside
of
the
general
federal
question,
jurisdiction
of
1331
which
is
not
at
issue
here
because
there
is
no
claim
that
$10,000.00
is
in
dispute.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
because
there
is
no
jurisdiction
under
the
social
security
act
per
se
and
congress
never
intended
it
to
be
jurisdictional
under
the
social
security
act
per
se
that
the
only
issue
left
in
this
case
is
whether
this
court
can
hear
it
by
virtue
of
this
claim
being
pendent
to
a
substantial
constitutional
claim.
and
that
was
the
issue
which
the
second
circuit
decided
when
they
held
no.
that
constitutional
claim
is
not
substantial
and
therefore
we
don’t
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
this
pendent
claim.
the
standard
they
use
and
the
standard
that
it
obviously
applies
here
is
the
test,
obviously
without
merit.
this
court
has
used
it
all
the
time.
the
standard
did
not
change
with
goosby
versus
osser
but
was
reaffirmed
there
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
equal
protection
violation
here,
it's
frivolous.
what
are
they
claiming?
they’re
claiming
--
they
are
claiming
that
they
are
getting
more
money
one
month
and
less
money
the
next
month
and
that
somehow
--
rather
they
are
being
treated
as
a
violation
of
equal
protection
but
the
essence
of
equal
protection
is
equal
treatment
and
they
are
being
treated
exactly
equally.
they
receive
a
duplicate
payment
to
which
they
are
not
entitled
and
to
which
nobody
else
gets
at
the
subsequent
month
or
the
subsequent
six
months,
they
pay
back
this
duplicate
payment
to
be
put
in
the
exact
same
effect
as
any
other
welfare
recipient.
in
fact,
i
would
suggest
that
if
this
is
a
constitutional
claim
of
any
substance
and
if
petitioners
were
to
prevail
here
it
would
be
just
as
substantial
for
any
other
recipient
who
did
not
get
the
recoupment
claim
to
bring
a
civil
rights
action
in
this
court
and
claim
with
denial
of
equal
protection
because
they
don’t
get
extra
payments
and
they
have
to
live
within
a
tight
budget.
i
think
that
the
second
circuit
clearly
determined
this
to
be
frivolous
because
as
the
second
circuit
says,
the
purposes
of
equal
protection
are
served
by
treating
all
alike
without
granting
special
favor
to
those
who
have
misappropriated
their
rent
allowance.
now,
since
this
claim
is
obviously
without
merit
as
it
must
be,
there
is
obviously
on
any
minimal
rational
basis
test,
a
state
can
allocate
its
limited
funds
so
that
every
recipient
receives
an
equal
share.
and
we
don’t
put
this
thing
into
encourage
mismanagement
or
discourage
mismanagement,
that’s
not
the
issue
here.
the
issue
is
that
we
are
trying
to
treat
all
of
these
recipients
equally.
we
are
not
required
to
give
them
this
extra
rent
allowance.
we
can’t
allow
them
to
be
evicted.
there
is
no
federal
constitutional
or
even
statutory
requirement
that
we
say
to
this
people
look,
if
you
choose
to
stay
in
the
same
house
and
not
go
through
the
vicissitudes
of
eviction,
we
have
to
do
this
for
you.
we
don’t
have
to
do
it.
but
we
are
doing
it
because
we
feel
that
eviction
is
a
very
traumatic
experience
for
welfare
recipients.
but
we
only
have
limited
funds
at
the
same
time.
and
there
is
certainly
nothing
unreasonable
about
this
sort
of
approach
to
give
people
extra
moneys
to
help
them
out
and
then
to
take
the
moneys
back
so
that
we
can
in
effect
treat
them
the
same
as
any
other
welfare
recipient.
mr.
michael
colodner
that
is
absolutely
right
your
honor
and
in
fact
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
a
very
real
alternative.
if
in
fact
we
are
not
allowed
to
make
this
payments
because
we
have
to
make
them
to
everybody
else,
is
what
it
comes
down
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
colodner
if
the
other
--
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
michael
colodner
we
would
have
to
give
everybody
a
bonus
or
if
we
were
forced
to
pay
this
back
we
would
have
to
give
a
ratable
reduction
to
everybody
else.
we’re
only
dealing
from
a
pool
of
finite
funds.
if
we
start
giving
more
to
one
group,
we
are
going
to
start
giving
less
to
the
other
group
and
as
a
result
everyone’s
grants
could
be
cut.
as
the
supreme
court
has
said
we
can
do
in
rosado,
we
can
give
a
ratable
reduction.
and
that
would
ultimately
probably
be
the
result
of
this.
but
it
will
probably
be
more
realistic
to
assume
that
if
we
could
not
recoup
we
just
would
not
give
these
duplicate
rent
payments.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
disagree
with
his
answer
to
this
extent.
yes,
there
are
other
measures
that
can
be
utilized.
but
i
don’t
think
any
of
this
--
i
don’t
think
any
of
the
other
measures
really
solved
the
problem.
and
this
is
a
very
sticky
problem.
what
do
you
do
to
people
who
misallocate
the
money
that
they’re
paid?
well,
you
can
say,
i’ll
give
them
protective
payments.
but
the
federal
government
says
you
can’t
give
more
than
10%
of
all
recipients’
protected
payments.
the
federal
government
in
fact
doesn’t
even
want
us
these
protective
payments
because
one
of
the
objects
of
the
social
security
act
is
to
in
fact
make
people
self-sufficient.
one
court
suggested
that
we
sue
them
which
is
absurd.
we
have
got
people
who
have
no
funds.
they
suggest
well,
if
the
parent
can
manage
to
take
the
children
out
of
a
home,
that's
certainly
more
drastic
than
having
them
--
than
recouping
money
over
six
months.
now,
petitioners
are
saying,
“well,
there's
this
emergency
assistance.”
the
new
york
courts
have
held
that
in
cases
of
destitution,
where
destitution
can
be
shown,
they
will
order
this
social
service
department
to
pay
under
the
emergency
assistance
provision.
but
this
is
a
level
that
you
have
to
reach
down
to
a
certain
level.
and
it
does
not
deal
with
what
would
be
a
ordinary
recoupment
case.
it
may
or
may
not
occur.
there
are
alternative
remedies.
there
are
remedies
which
have
policy
implications
and
all
sorts
of
direction.
and
new
york
state
has
chosen
a
remedy
which
allows
the
person
to
forestall
eviction,
forestall
being
thrown
on
the
street
and
being
sent
to
live
in
a
motel
somewhere
or
at
the
same
time
protecting
the
moneys
of
the
state
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
this
particular
choice
of
new
york
is
entirely
rational
and
is
in
no
way
any
violation
of
the
constitution.
mr.
michael
colodner
the
state
pays
the
bill
on
motels.
mr.
michael
colodner
of
course
no,
the
recipient
doesn’t
have
to
pay
that
back
but
they
didn’t
get
the
benefit
of
the
extra
payment
which
allowed
them
to
stay.
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
right.
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
right.
mr.
michael
colodner
the
reason
being
that
it’s
the
state’s
decision
that
it
is
more
beneficial
to
keep
the
family
where
they’re
living
rather
than
to
throw
them
out
and
force
them
to
live
in
some
motel
somewhere
away
from
where
they
are
living
with
perhaps
greater
detriment
to
the
children
involved.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
would
think
that
this
will
require
individual
--
mr.
michael
colodner
there
are
rules
for
standards
on
both
housing
and
motels.
i
would
respectfully
suggest
your
honor
that
living
in
a
motel
is
not
be
preferred
to
living
in
a
residential
community.
mr.
michael
colodner
new
york
state
your
honor
happens
to
guarantee
housing.
it’s
a
humane
decision
on
the
part
of
the
state.
most
states
don’t.
mr.
michael
colodner
you're
assuming
your
honor
that
the
question
of
putting.
we’re
not
putting
this
people
in
an
apartment.
we
are
keeping
them
in
the
apartment
of
which
they
used
to
be
living.
mr.
michael
colodner
we
are
not
evicting
them.
and
that
is
a
definite
difference.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
would
say
the
argument
was
made
to
this
extent.
that
was
the
jurisdictional
basis
cited
in
the
complaint,
1343.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
don’t
--
mr.
michael
colodner
the
argument
was
made
to
the
extent
that
1343
was
mentioned
in
the
petitioner’s
complaint
until
the
extent
of
the
states
brief
in
showing
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
once
there
was
an
insubstantial
constitutional
claim
set
forth
the
fact
that
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction
under
1343.
mr.
michael
colodner
evidently.
mr.
michael
colodner
evidently.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
would
assume
so
because
it
is
not
in
the
decision
of
the
court.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
can
only
read
the
opinion
as
your
honor
has
read
the
opinion.
i
do
not
know
what
was
in
the
minds
of
the
judges.
i
do
know
what
was
presented
to
the
court.
that
the
opinion
is
what
it
says.
mr.
michael
colodner
it
was
presented
--
mr.
michael
colodner
not
in
the
detail
that
is
presented
here
but
we
did
present
this
argument
in
response
to
the
fact
that
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
for
a
claim
arising
under
the
social
security
act
if
there
was
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
correct.
mr.
michael
colodner
apparently.
mr.
michael
colodner
thank
you.
mr.
michael
colodner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
regulation
of
the
new
york
state
department
of
social
services
in
which
the
state
makes
an
additional
rent
payment
to
welfare
recipient
that
is
over
and
above
the
regular
shelter
allowance
which
that
recipient
would
recede
and
then
recoup
it
over
a
period
of
six
months.
the
requirements
for
this
regulation
is
that
the
recipient
for
whatever
reason
misallocate
his
or
her
regular
shelter
allowance.
the
recipient
then
becomes
threatened
with
the
eviction.
the
department
then
steps
in
at
the
request
of
the
recipient
and
offers
them
an
opportunity
to
remain
where
they
are
living
and
therefore
receive
a
duplicate
rent
payment.
but
if
they
choose
this
option,
they
will
have
to
repay
this
extra
amount
over
the
course
of
the
next
six
months.
now,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
challenged
this
because
they
claimed
there’s
a
denial
of
equal
protection
because
those
who
are
subject
to
recoupment
are
in
some
matter
being
treated
differently
from
those
who
are
not
subject
to
this
recoupment
even
though
this
other
class
never
received
the
extra
payment.
the
second
circuit
found
this
claim
to
be
insubstantial
and
as
such
found
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
pendent
statutory
claim
which
involves
whether
the
new
york
state
regulation
at
issue
violates
the
social
security
act.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
would
suggest
your
honor
that
the
1983
and
1343
deal
with
a
specific
amendment.
it
deals
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
it’s
the
civil
right
statute.
the
wording
of
those
statutes
are
such
that
it
deals
with
rights
protected
by
constitution
and
laws
or
laws
protecting
equal
rights.
if
your
honors,
interpretation
of
--
mr.
michael
colodner
first
amendment
rights
would
probably
be
covered
by
1983.
mr.
michael
colodner
well,
it
depends
on
how
it
is
and
how
broadly
you
would
read
1983.
1983
was
passed
specifically
to
enforce
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
is
not
a
self
executing
amendment.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
michael
colodner
i
would
suggest
that
at
any
event
it
could
not
include
the
supremacy
clause
because
there
would
be
no
reason
for
congress
to
put
in
jurisdiction
and
laws
protecting
equal
rights
if
in
fact
the
constitution
included
the
whole
kind
of
federal
laws.
mr.
michael
colodner
yes,
that
is
correct.
but
i
would
think
that
in
terms
of
what
congress
meant
when
they
established
jurisdiction
to
get
claims
under
the
constitution
using
the
supremacy
clause
argument,
they
established
1331
which
is
the
general
federal
question
jurisdiction
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
colodner
i
do
not
know
of
any
cases
which
deal
with
this
issue.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
don’t
believe
it's
here
because
it
was
never
raised
by
the
--
mr.
michael
colodner
that
could
be
your
honor.
mr.
michael
colodner
this
court
has
never
really
decided
that
type
of
issue
at
all.
i
am
aware
of
the
decision.
i
think
it
was
last
year,
it
was
dealt
with
the
three-judge
court
statute
which
--
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
of
course
that’s
–
than
last
year,
which
held
that
if
my
recollection
is
correct
that
the
supremacy
clause
does
not
include
within
this
three-judge
court
--
mr.
michael
colodner
2281,
that’s
correct.
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
correct.
mr.
michael
colodner
but
insofar
as
what
the
question
that
your
honor
has
brought
if
i
am
not
aware
of
any
cases
that
it's
ever
reached
that
question.
i
point
out
that
in
this
case
--
mr.
michael
colodner
because
there
is
no
monetary
amount
to
$10,000.00
in
dispute
at
least
--
mr.
michael
colodner
it
would
seem
to
me
that
you
can
always
bring
a
claim.
1331
is
general
federal
question
jurisdiction.
this
is
a
claim
arising
out
of
the
federal
statute.
it’s
the
--
1331
says
arising
out
of
federal
statutes,
there’d
be
no
reason
why
it
couldn’t
be
brought.
mr.
michael
colodner
it’s
a
right
--
mr.
michael
colodner
it’s
a
right
arising
under
the
constitution
or
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
michael
colodner
depends
on
how
the
plaintiffs
might
claim
--
mr.
michael
colodner
in
this
particular
case
--
mr.
michael
colodner
i
think
--
mr.
michael
colodner
well
--
mr.
michael
colodner
i
think
that
presupposes
your
initial
question
as
where
does
constitutionality
come
in
to
this
with
the
supremacy,
--
where
the
supremacy
--
mr.
michael
colodner
i
would
think
that
if
a
federal
statute,
if
a
state
statute
conflicted
with
the
federal
statute.
mr.
michael
colodner
well,
that
would
be
the
supremacy
clause
--
mr.
michael
colodner
i
think
if
you
go
back
to
the
history
of
the
civil
rights
act
here,
there
was
no
indication
that
it
was
ever
meant
to
include
this
type
of
broad
colloquy
of
including
every
single
state
law
that
is
perhaps
contrary
to
every
single
federal
law.
there
is
nothing
in
the
history
of
the
civil
rights
act
that
leads
to
that
conclusion.
and
while
you
can
make
a
verbal
argument
to
that
effect,
i
don’t
think
that
the
history
bears
it
out.
now
insofar
as
the
--
mr.
michael
colodner
i
think
your
honor
that
if
you
take
the
cases
in
the
last
four
or
five
years
that
there
really
is
not
a
conflict
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
some
dicta
in
one
or
two
cases.
because
1983,
lets
get
right
into
1983,
the
claim
of
the
petitioners
here
is
that
it
provides
a
remedy
for
all
federal
statute
and
they
look
to
the
language
which
says,
“all
rights
are
secured
by
constitution
and
laws.”
and
they
claim
laws
include
a
social
security
act
and
therefore
they
have
a
right
to
come
into
federal
court
to
--
at
least
allege
a
federal
cause
of
action
under
1983.
but
the
1871
act,
which
is
the
basis
for
1983
did
not
mention
rights
secured
by
laws.
it
only
mentioned
rights
secured
by
the
constitution.
the
change
that
occurred
in
1871
act
came
during
the
revision
when
the
1866,
1870,
1871
acts
were
all
codified
together
and
clarified
and
put
into
one
provision.
and
here
the
reviser
put
in
the
words,
“and
laws.”
and
i
think
that
since
there
is
no
explanation
as
to
why
the
reviser
put
this
in.
it
would
appear
that
he
was
referring
to
the
laws
that
were
included
in
that
whole
civil
rights
package
which
were
in
essence
the
1866
civil
rights
act
and
the
1870
civil
rights
act.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
history
of
the
civil
rights
act
that
congress
ever
intended
to
create
a
federal
cause
of
action
for
every
conceivable
federal
statute
that
would
ever
come
into
existence
aside
from
statutes
that
enforce
the
thirteenth
to
fourteenth
and
the
fifteenth
amendments.
in
fact,
the
only
supreme
court
case
that
ever
considered
this
issue
as
to
what
the
scope
of
“and
laws”
what
was
a
1900
supreme
court
case
and
it
held
that
this
language
did
not
apply
at
least
to
a
patent
rights
case,
holding
that
1983
applied
to
civil
rights
only,
at
least
showing
that
the
supreme
court
in
1900
believed
that
1983
was
a
failing
narrow
statute.
now
when
this
court
has
spoken
of
1983
in
terms
of
the
rights
that
it
protects,
it
has
spoken
of
protection
of
constitutional
rights.
and
this
court
has
never
held
1983
to
its
literal
language
as
witnessed
in
the
case
of
tenney
versus
brandhove.
i
think
it
is
important
to
note,
that
when
congress
passes
a
federal
statute
they
generally
provide
their
own
remedy
within
the
statute.
the
social
security
act
when
it
was
passed
provided
no
remedy
in
federal
court
for
recipients
of
afdc
benefits.
and
i
would
suggest
that
there
was
no
reason
why
congress
which
always
provides
its
own
remedies
when
it
passes
any
new
statute
would
pass
a
statute
which
creates
a
federal
cause
of
action
as
to
every
conceivable
future
federal
law
in
any
field
whatever,
banking,
tax,
it
makes
no
difference
simply
because
state
action
might
be
involved.
there
was
just
no
reason
why
congress
would
pass
this
statute
and
there
is
no
reason
to
give
the
language
of
“
and
laws
“
in
1983,
the
broad
interpretation
that
petitioners
want
to
give
and
that
this
court
has
stated
in
dicta
might
apply.
i
would
suggest
that
even
if
1983
is
as
broad
as
petitioner
say
it
is
and
if
it
includes
every
single
federal
law,
it
is
clear
that
congress
did
not
provide
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
to
hear
this
course
of
action
because
the
language
of
1343
(3)
is
narrow.
it
says
deprivation
of
rights
secured
by
the
constitution
and
if
any
act
of
congress
providing
the
equal
rights.
now
the
history
of
that
clause
is
also
very
unclear.
in
the
1874
codification
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
over
rights
secured
by
any
law,
the
circuit
court
on
the
other
hand
had
rights
secured
by
any
law
providing
for
equal
rights.
these
were
probably
meant
to
be
concurrent
because
the
basis
of
this
was
the
same
the
1866
act
which
did
provide
concurrent
jurisdiction.
i
have
shown
it
in
my
brief
that
this
address
was
note
on
the
circuit
court
provision
that
chose
it
was
intended
to
be
narrowly
applied
to
equal
rights
statutes.
and
in
1911,
congress
explicitly
shows
the
equal
rights
language
which
shows
a
clear
intent
of
congress
that
it
at
least
believed
that
the
original
jurisdiction
was
limited
to
equal
rights
provisions.
now
it
is
very
interesting
that
the
petitioners
have
come
to
this
court
and
it
really
changed
the
whole
thrust
of
their
argument
because
in
the
lower
courts
they
were
arguing
at
the
social
security
act,
was
the
act
of
congress
providing
for
equal
rights
or
the
act
of
congress
providing
for
civil
rights?
now
they’ve
changed
the
argument.
they
say
that
1983
itself
is
such
an
act.
and
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
really
bootstraps
argument
because
1983
is
a
procedural
statute.
it
creates
a
cause
of
action
where
someone
is
deprived
of
rights
that
are
enumerated
somewhere
else.
it
is
in
the
words
of
1343.
the
civil
action
authorized
by
law
to
be
commenced.
that’s
right
on
the
first
line
of
1343.
it
is
not
the
act,
the
substantive
act
providing
for
equal
rights.
if
in
fact
1983
were
an
equal
rights
act,
there’d
be
a
lot
of
problems
just
on
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
number
one,
it
would
be
inconsistent
to
say
that
1983
is
the
authorizing
law
and
at
the
same
is
a
substantive
law.
number
two,
you'd
have
a
complete
redundancy
here
if
1983
is
an
equal
rights
act
because
1343
(3)
refers
to
rights
secured
by
the
constitution,
which
means
that
the
language
of
1343
(3)
would
be
redundant
if
it
includes
1983
which
already
refers
to
rights
secured
by
the
constitution.
all
congress
would
need
to
have
done
would
just
be
to
say
there
is
jurisdiction
under
any
equal
rights
statute.
there’d
be
no
reason
even
to
mention
constitution
if
1983
is
brought
down
into
the
jurisdictional
provision.
and
thirdly,
i
would
say
incongruously
if
1983
is
an
equal
rights
act,
its
language
and
laws
is
much
too
broad
to
encompass
itself
within
that
narrow
definition.
i
think
the
key
to
this
case
is
the
decision
in
georgia
versus
rachel.
because
they
are
dealing
with
the
same
language
in
the
removal
statute
this
court
held
that
the
term
any
law
providing
for
equal
rights
was
narrow.
it
meant
laws
dealing
with
historic
equal
rights
and
specifically
said,
it
did
not
mean
1983.
that’s
within
the
language
of
that
opinion
and
i
think
its
very
interesting
to
note
that
both
1443,
which
is
the
removal
statute
and
1343
(3)
which
is
the
statute
at
issue
here
derive
from
the
same
provision
of
the
1866
civil
rights
act,
which
is
subsection
3,
the
very
same
provision.
it
would
seem
that
if
1443
was
that
narrow,
1983
which
was
codified,
the
exact
same
year
as
1443
must
have
the
same
meaning.
i
would
also
suggest
that
if
congress
was
so
concerned
about
passing
1343
(4)
ninety
years
later
just
to
add
the
right
to
vote.
they
evidently
also
considered
the
phrase,
equal
rights
to
have
a
very
narrow
meaning.
and
in
fact,
i
would
point
out
that
the
history
of
1343
(3)
shows
that
the
“and
laws”
language
of
1983
was
probably
meant
to
be
more
limited
than
this
court
had
hinted
it
might
be.
now,
the
petitioners
also
argue
that
somehow
rather
in
1957,
congress
passed
a
new
jurisdictional
provision
to
the
civil
rights
act,
1343
(4)
which
somehow
changed
the
course
of
all
civil
rights
jurisdiction.
the
jurisdictional
provision
there
is
an
act
of
congress
providing
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights
including
the
right
to
vote.
well,
what
does
this
really
mean?
civil
rights
including
the
right
to
vote.
and
if
you
look
to
see
what
congress
was
really
trying
to
do
here,
you’ll
see
essentially
that
what
was
at
stake
in
1957
was
a
voting
rights
act.
the
house
report
called
this
particular
provision
as
a
technical
amendment.
the
house
debate
only
dealt
with
what
they
called
civil
rights
and
specifically
included
by
rulings
of
the
house
chairman,
economic
rights
of
which
we
are
obviously
dealing
with
here.
the
senate
debate
is
even
more
interesting
because
it
limits
itself
solely
to
voting
rights
because
of
a
very
strong
reaction
on
the
part
of
those
senators
favoring
state's
rights,
that
this
particular
vote
civil
rights
act
of
1957
might
be
too
broad
because
historically
this
would
be
the
first
civil
rights
act
that
was
passed
since
reconstruction.
the
provision
to
keep
in
this
--
what
became
1343
(4)
was
proposed
by
a
similar
case
of
south
dakota.
and
he
throughout
the
debates
states
that
the
reason
he
wants
this
provision
in
is
because
it
deals
wholly
and
he
says
that
wholly
with
the
establishment
of
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
toward
the
state
suits
relating
to
the
right
to
vote
and
just
the
right
to
vote.
i
think
that
what
you
have
here
with
1343
(4)
is
a
act
which
creates
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
to
hear
suits
relating
to
the
right
to
vote.
congress
was
very
uncertain
as
to
what
the
jurisdictional
limits
of
1343
(3)
were.
and
they
were
clarifying
it.
in
fact
the
caption
is
very
interesting
here.
the
caption
of
1343
just
says
civil
rights.
when
this
caption
--
when
1343
(4)
was
added
in
1957,
the
caption
was
amended
to
say
civil
rights
and
elective
franchise.
that
was
all
that
was
added.
so
what
you
have
here
essentially
when
you
deal
with
civil
rights
in
1343
(4)
is
the
same
rights
that
were
in
1343
(3)
except
that
it
includes
the
right
to
vote.
now,
it
is
true
that
1343
(4)
does
not
include
--
mr.
michael
colodner
whether
i
think
it
or
whether
the
congress
thought
so?
mr.
michael
colodner
i
don’t
believe
that
congress
felt
sure
whether
it
did
or
whether
it
did
not.
and
they
want
--
since
they
were
dealing
in
the
civil
rights
act,
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
there
would
be
no
jurisdictional
contradiction
in
the
statutes
between
the
jurisdiction
set
forth
in
1343
and
the
jurisdiction
provided
in
--
mr.
michael
colodner
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
correct.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
would
think
your
honor
--
mr.
michael
colodner
your
honor,
i
would
think
that
whether
--
mr.
michael
colodner
the
fifteenth
amendment
your
honors
provides
for
the
right
to
vote.
but
congress
wasn’t
very
concerned
about
the
fact
that
what
did
equal
rights
statute
mean?
and
also
1343
(4)
provides
a
right
of
action
not
under
color
of
state
law.
because
1971,
the
voting
rights
act
was
amended
provided
for
the
attorney
general
to
bring
suits
against
private
individuals
acting
under
color
of
state
law
or
not
under
color
of
state
law.
and
this
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
they
had
to
put
in
some
different
provision
to
allow
for
these
suits
to
be
brought
in
federal
court
without
a
jurisdictional
amount
not
under
color
of
state
law.
but
i
don’t
believe
there's
anything
in
the
history
of
1343
(4)
which
suggests
that
the
subject
matter
of
the
civil
rights
act
was
being
expanded
anymore
than
the
debates
indicated.
i
would
suggest
that
the
rights
of
1343
(4)
are
no
greater
than
the
rights
of
1343
(3).
and
that
congress
never
intended
that
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
suits
that
arise
under
the
afdc
provisions
of
the
social
security
act.
it’s
very
interesting
that
when
the
social
security
act
was
passed
in
1935,
there
was
jurisdiction
provided
in
the
federal
courts
for
claims
arising
under
the
old
age
provisions
but
not
under
the
aid
to
dependent
children
provision.
this
evidences
and
intends
on
the
part
of
congress
that
the
federal
courts
were
not
going
to
hear
every
single
minor,
afdc
claim
outside
of
the
general
federal
question,
jurisdiction
of
1331
which
is
not
at
issue
here
because
there
is
no
claim
that
$10,000.00
is
in
dispute.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
because
there
is
no
jurisdiction
under
the
social
security
act
per
se
and
congress
never
intended
it
to
be
jurisdictional
under
the
social
security
act
per
se
that
the
only
issue
left
in
this
case
is
whether
this
court
can
hear
it
by
virtue
of
this
claim
being
pendent
to
a
substantial
constitutional
claim.
and
that
was
the
issue
which
the
second
circuit
decided
when
they
held
no.
that
constitutional
claim
is
not
substantial
and
therefore
we
don’t
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
this
pendent
claim.
the
standard
they
use
and
the
standard
that
it
obviously
applies
here
is
the
test,
obviously
without
merit.
this
court
has
used
it
all
the
time.
the
standard
did
not
change
with
goosby
versus
osser
but
was
reaffirmed
there
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
equal
protection
violation
here,
it's
frivolous.
what
are
they
claiming?
they’re
claiming
--
they
are
claiming
that
they
are
getting
more
money
one
month
and
less
money
the
next
month
and
that
somehow
--
rather
they
are
being
treated
as
a
violation
of
equal
protection
but
the
essence
of
equal
protection
is
equal
treatment
and
they
are
being
treated
exactly
equally.
they
receive
a
duplicate
payment
to
which
they
are
not
entitled
and
to
which
nobody
else
gets
at
the
subsequent
month
or
the
subsequent
six
months,
they
pay
back
this
duplicate
payment
to
be
put
in
the
exact
same
effect
as
any
other
welfare
recipient.
in
fact,
i
would
suggest
that
if
this
is
a
constitutional
claim
of
any
substance
and
if
petitioners
were
to
prevail
here
it
would
be
just
as
substantial
for
any
other
recipient
who
did
not
get
the
recoupment
claim
to
bring
a
civil
rights
action
in
this
court
and
claim
with
denial
of
equal
protection
because
they
don’t
get
extra
payments
and
they
have
to
live
within
a
tight
budget.
i
think
that
the
second
circuit
clearly
determined
this
to
be
frivolous
because
as
the
second
circuit
says,
the
purposes
of
equal
protection
are
served
by
treating
all
alike
without
granting
special
favor
to
those
who
have
misappropriated
their
rent
allowance.
now,
since
this
claim
is
obviously
without
merit
as
it
must
be,
there
is
obviously
on
any
minimal
rational
basis
test,
a
state
can
allocate
its
limited
funds
so
that
every
recipient
receives
an
equal
share.
and
we
don’t
put
this
thing
into
encourage
mismanagement
or
discourage
mismanagement,
that’s
not
the
issue
here.
the
issue
is
that
we
are
trying
to
treat
all
of
these
recipients
equally.
we
are
not
required
to
give
them
this
extra
rent
allowance.
we
can’t
allow
them
to
be
evicted.
there
is
no
federal
constitutional
or
even
statutory
requirement
that
we
say
to
this
people
look,
if
you
choose
to
stay
in
the
same
house
and
not
go
through
the
vicissitudes
of
eviction,
we
have
to
do
this
for
you.
we
don’t
have
to
do
it.
but
we
are
doing
it
because
we
feel
that
eviction
is
a
very
traumatic
experience
for
welfare
recipients.
but
we
only
have
limited
funds
at
the
same
time.
and
there
is
certainly
nothing
unreasonable
about
this
sort
of
approach
to
give
people
extra
moneys
to
help
them
out
and
then
to
take
the
moneys
back
so
that
we
can
in
effect
treat
them
the
same
as
any
other
welfare
recipient.
mr.
michael
colodner
that
is
absolutely
right
your
honor
and
in
fact
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
a
very
real
alternative.
if
in
fact
we
are
not
allowed
to
make
this
payments
because
we
have
to
make
them
to
everybody
else,
is
what
it
comes
down
to
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
colodner
if
the
other
--
i
would
say
that
--
mr.
michael
colodner
we
would
have
to
give
everybody
a
bonus
or
if
we
were
forced
to
pay
this
back
we
would
have
to
give
a
ratable
reduction
to
everybody
else.
we’re
only
dealing
from
a
pool
of
finite
funds.
if
we
start
giving
more
to
one
group,
we
are
going
to
start
giving
less
to
the
other
group
and
as
a
result
everyone’s
grants
could
be
cut.
as
the
supreme
court
has
said
we
can
do
in
rosado,
we
can
give
a
ratable
reduction.
and
that
would
ultimately
probably
be
the
result
of
this.
but
it
will
probably
be
more
realistic
to
assume
that
if
we
could
not
recoup
we
just
would
not
give
these
duplicate
rent
payments.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
disagree
with
his
answer
to
this
extent.
yes,
there
are
other
measures
that
can
be
utilized.
but
i
don’t
think
any
of
this
--
i
don’t
think
any
of
the
other
measures
really
solved
the
problem.
and
this
is
a
very
sticky
problem.
what
do
you
do
to
people
who
misallocate
the
money
that
they’re
paid?
well,
you
can
say,
i’ll
give
them
protective
payments.
but
the
federal
government
says
you
can’t
give
more
than
10%
of
all
recipients’
protected
payments.
the
federal
government
in
fact
doesn’t
even
want
us
these
protective
payments
because
one
of
the
objects
of
the
social
security
act
is
to
in
fact
make
people
self-sufficient.
one
court
suggested
that
we
sue
them
which
is
absurd.
we
have
got
people
who
have
no
funds.
they
suggest
well,
if
the
parent
can
manage
to
take
the
children
out
of
a
home,
that's
certainly
more
drastic
than
having
them
--
than
recouping
money
over
six
months.
now,
petitioners
are
saying,
“well,
there's
this
emergency
assistance.”
the
new
york
courts
have
held
that
in
cases
of
destitution,
where
destitution
can
be
shown,
they
will
order
this
social
service
department
to
pay
under
the
emergency
assistance
provision.
but
this
is
a
level
that
you
have
to
reach
down
to
a
certain
level.
and
it
does
not
deal
with
what
would
be
a
ordinary
recoupment
case.
it
may
or
may
not
occur.
there
are
alternative
remedies.
there
are
remedies
which
have
policy
implications
and
all
sorts
of
direction.
and
new
york
state
has
chosen
a
remedy
which
allows
the
person
to
forestall
eviction,
forestall
being
thrown
on
the
street
and
being
sent
to
live
in
a
motel
somewhere
or
at
the
same
time
protecting
the
moneys
of
the
state
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
this
particular
choice
of
new
york
is
entirely
rational
and
is
in
no
way
any
violation
of
the
constitution.
mr.
michael
colodner
the
state
pays
the
bill
on
motels.
mr.
michael
colodner
of
course
no,
the
recipient
doesn’t
have
to
pay
that
back
but
they
didn’t
get
the
benefit
of
the
extra
payment
which
allowed
them
to
stay.
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
right.
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
right.
mr.
michael
colodner
the
reason
being
that
it’s
the
state’s
decision
that
it
is
more
beneficial
to
keep
the
family
where
they’re
living
rather
than
to
throw
them
out
and
force
them
to
live
in
some
motel
somewhere
away
from
where
they
are
living
with
perhaps
greater
detriment
to
the
children
involved.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
would
think
that
this
will
require
individual
--
mr.
michael
colodner
there
are
rules
for
standards
on
both
housing
and
motels.
i
would
respectfully
suggest
your
honor
that
living
in
a
motel
is
not
be
preferred
to
living
in
a
residential
community.
mr.
michael
colodner
new
york
state
your
honor
happens
to
guarantee
housing.
it’s
a
humane
decision
on
the
part
of
the
state.
most
states
don’t.
mr.
michael
colodner
you're
assuming
your
honor
that
the
question
of
putting.
we’re
not
putting
this
people
in
an
apartment.
we
are
keeping
them
in
the
apartment
of
which
they
used
to
be
living.
mr.
michael
colodner
we
are
not
evicting
them.
and
that
is
a
definite
difference.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
would
say
the
argument
was
made
to
this
extent.
that
was
the
jurisdictional
basis
cited
in
the
complaint,
1343.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
don’t
--
mr.
michael
colodner
the
argument
was
made
to
the
extent
that
1343
was
mentioned
in
the
petitioner’s
complaint
until
the
extent
of
the
states
brief
in
showing
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
once
there
was
an
insubstantial
constitutional
claim
set
forth
the
fact
that
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction
under
1343.
mr.
michael
colodner
evidently.
mr.
michael
colodner
evidently.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
would
assume
so
because
it
is
not
in
the
decision
of
the
court.
mr.
michael
colodner
i
can
only
read
the
opinion
as
your
honor
has
read
the
opinion.
i
do
not
know
what
was
in
the
minds
of
the
judges.
i
do
know
what
was
presented
to
the
court.
that
the
opinion
is
what
it
says.
mr.
michael
colodner
it
was
presented
--
mr.
michael
colodner
not
in
the
detail
that
is
presented
here
but
we
did
present
this
argument
in
response
to
the
fact
that
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
for
a
claim
arising
under
the
social
security
act
if
there
was
not
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
michael
colodner
that’s
correct.
mr.
michael
colodner
apparently.
mr.
michael
colodner
thank
you.
