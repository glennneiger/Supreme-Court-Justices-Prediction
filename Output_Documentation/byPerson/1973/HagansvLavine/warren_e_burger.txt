before
you
get
in
to
that,
mr.
nathanson,
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
do
you
think
every
--
do
you
think
1983
reaches
every
federal
statute
that
confers
the
right
on
someone?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
can
you
think
of
any
right
under
a
federal
statute
that
--
then
would
not
be
within
the
reach
of
1983,
absent
the
declaration
by
congress
to
excluding
it.
it
takes
an
affirmative
exclusion,
is
that
your
position?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
would
the
same
thing
possibly
be
true
if
the
rent
allotment
were
taken
out
to
buy
three
color
television
sets
and
the
money
all
used
up.
would
you
then
make
the
same
dichotomy
of
classes
that
the
children
of
parents
who
went
out
and
bought
three
television
sets,
were
treated
differently
from
the
children
of
parents
who
were
more
of
approval
and
prudent.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
would
you
make
the
same
argument,
that’s
my
question.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
colodner.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
nothing
said
in
our
cases
in
the
last
four
to
five,
six
years
is
in
conflict
with
your
position
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
there
is
one
remedy
which
the
state
could
follow
if
you
do
not
prevail
here,
drastic
remedy.
they
could
simply
refuse
to
make
these
payments.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
other
way
that
you
could
ward
off
the
equal
protection
claims
of
all
the
other
recipients?
chief
justice
warren
