do
you
agree
that
those
civil

acts
were
after

justice
thurgood
marshall
after
the
thirteenth,

amendments,
weren’t
they
to
enforce
to
those
three
amendments?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
it
didn’t
include
the
right
to
vote?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
do
you
know
what
the
fifteenth
amendment
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mentioned
the
motel,
is
that
true
that
you
go
to
motel
and
you
pay
the
bill
and
they
don’t
pay
you
back?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
recipient
doesn’t
have
to
pay
it
back?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
got
me
in
trouble.
if
you
move
somebody
into
a
house
that
is
$60.00,
well,
let’s
be
realistic,
$300.00
a
month
and
you
pay
that,
they
have
to
pay
the
$300.00
back,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
movement
to
a
motel
and
paying
$300.00,
you
don’t
have
to
pay
that
back?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
reason
being?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
that
some
motels
in
new
york
are
worst
than
the
houses
the
poor
people
live
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
you
don’t
have
any
rules
there
about
the
standards
of
motel,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
agree
on
that
but
i
just
--
it's
just
they
decided
that
they’d
pay
the
motel
bill,
i
guess
because
it’s
the
only
way
out.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
not
talking
about
humane
decisions
and
what
have
you.
i
just
have
difficulty
in
understanding
that
if
you
have
a
family
of
a
husband
and
wife
and
two
children
and
you
put
them
in
an
apartment,
they
have
to
pay
the
money
back.
if
you
put
them
in
a
two-room
motel,
they
don’t
have
to
pay
the
money
back.
