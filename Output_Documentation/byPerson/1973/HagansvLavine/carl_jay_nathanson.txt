mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
second
circuit
did
not
determine
this
case
on
the
merits.
the
court
concluded
that
because
the
complaint
failed
to
plead
a
substantial
constitutional
question,
the
district
court
was
without
pendent
jurisdiction
to
determine
as
it
did
at
the
new
york
welfare
regulation
violated
the
social
security
act.
because
of
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case
therefore,
two
questions
are
presented
to
this
court.
the
first
question
is
a
narrow
one,
whether
the
pleadings
raised
nonfrivolous
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
pendent
question
was
whether
or
not
the
new
york
welfare
regulation
violated
the
social
security
act.
there
is
a
social
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
well,
i
don’t
think
you
need
to
resort
to
pendent
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
lower
court
determined
that
the
district
court
lack
jurisdiction
to
pass
upon
that
pendent
claim
because
of
the
absence
of
a
substantial
constitutional
claim.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
it
would
not
be
pendent,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
well,
your
honor
before
the
court
can
determine
whether
or
not
it’s
correctly
to
determine,
to
characterize
that
as
a
pendent
claim,
i
would
first
have
to
pass
upon
the
second
aspect
of
our
argument
which
is
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
which
is
that
absent
a
constitutional
claim,
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
under
1343
(3)
and
1343
(4)
of
an
action
founded
on
1983
of
the
civil
rights
act
to
determine
the
social
security
act
claim
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
think
that
any
time
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no
your
honor,
i
don’t.
and
believe
there
is
independent
federal
jurisdiction
to
determine
that
claim.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
contend
your
honor
that
the
social
security
act
is
one
of
the
laws
described
by
section
1983
and
when
a
state
acts
to
deprive
a
citizen
of
--
a
right,
federal
rights
or
the
color
of
state
law
that
therefore
there’s
jurisdiction
to
hear
that
remedy
under
1343
and
1343
(4).
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
it
would
be
a
constitutional
claim
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
we
didn’t
raise
it
in
the
terms
of
the
supremacy
clause
being
the
constitutional
basis.
although
in
fact
that
is
true
that
that
isn’t
a
basis
but
we
didn’t
raise
it
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no
your
honor,
except
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
under
supremacy
clause.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
in
1971,
the
new
york
state
department
of
social
services
promulgated
regulation
352.7
(g)
(7)
of
title
18
of
the
new
york
code
of
rules
and
regulations.
that
regulation
was
submitted
to
hew
for
approval.
hew
on
several
occasions
notified
me
that
that
regulation
fails
to
satisfy
federal
requirements.
not
withstanding
such
noncompliance,
new
york
state
continued
to
give
the
regulations,
statewide
application
and
continues
to
receive
federal
funds.
the
regulation
is
known
as
the
recoupment
regulation.
it
permits
the
local
--
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
think
1983
was
intended
to
grant
that
type
of
remedy
where
a
state
deprives
one
or
other
federal
right
that
1983
covers
a
full
gamut
of
federal
rights.
and
it
was
intended
unless
congress
has
expressly
limited
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
hear
that
type
of
claim
your
honor
that
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
federal
right
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
1983
--
constitutional
and
laws,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
your
honor.
the
recoupment
regulation
permits
a
local
department
of
social
services
to
provide
a
duplicate
rent
payment
to
a
recipient
of
public
assistance
who
is
threatened
with
eviction
for
nonpayment
of
rent
but
mandates
that
that
duplicate
rent
payment
be
recouped
over
the
next
six
months
in
equal
amounts.
in
very
practical
terms,
the
rent
recoupment
regulation
solves
the
immediate
crisis
but
creates
a
far
more
serious
crisis
since
during
the
period
of
the
recoupment,
the
family
is
deprived
of
the
very
means
to
sustain
themselves,
to
feed,
clothe
or
shelter
--
to
house
themselves.
the
state
argues
that
this
rent
recoupment
regulation
turns
on
--
is
designed
to
deter
mismanagement.
as
the
record
demonstrates,
the
recoupment
regulation
does
not
turn
on
mismanagement.
petitioner
hagans
and
his
two
children
reside
in
the
county
with
an
acute
housing
shortage.
the
state
has
conceded
that
petitioner
wasn’t
able
to
secure
housing
within
the
rent
schedule.
petitioner
received
a
shelter
allowance
from
the
local
department
of
social
services
in
the
amount
of
$165.00.
she
was
unable
to
find
housing
at
that
allowance.
she
therefore
was
--
she
then
found
housing
in
the
amount
of
$200.00
per
month.
the
local
agency
approved
that
housing.
she
was
simply
unable
to
continue
making
the
rent
payments
with
the
moneys
intended
to
her
other
basic
needs
and
with
that
period
of
time,
fell
into
arrears.
and
she
was
evicted.
she
was
rehoused
by
the
department
in
the
neighboring
county.
the
money
used
to
rehouse
her
was
then
deducted
in
full
from
the
next
months
grant
leaving
a
family
of
three
with
worth
$17.00
for
the
entire
months
needs.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
she
was
homeless
your
honor.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
she
found
the
housing.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
she
did.
the
recoupment
regulation
is
implemented
with
or
without
consent
of
the
recipient.
in
the
case
of
two
of
the
named
petitioners,
the
local
department
social
services
paid
the
rent
directly
to
the
landlord
to
forestall
a
nonpayment
proceeding
without
the
prior
consent
or
even
knowledge
of
the
recipient
and
then
recouped
the
money
from
the
subsequent
months
grant.
so
it
doesn’t
really
turn
on
the
consent
of
the
recipient
or
knowledge
of
the
recipient
either.
and
in
those
two
cases,
the
recipients
had
not
paid
rent
--
in
one
of
those
cases
the
recipient
had
not
paid
rent
because
she
was
protesting
the
failure
of
the
landlord
to
make
repairs.
so
in
effect,
the
recoupment
regulation
of
fraud
were
an
opportunity
to
even
assert
that
defense.
in
the
complaint
filed
in
the
district
court,
petitioners
asserted
three
basic
claims.
they
asserted
an
equal
protection
claim
alleging
that
the
rent
recoupment
regulation
irrationally
creates
two
classes
of
needy
dependent
children
in
new
york
state.
children
whose
parents
require
an
emergency
rent
payment
are
deprived
of
their
right
to
have
their
grant
determined
in
accordance
with
the
state
standard
of
need
while
other
children
who
receive
assistance
under
the
program
have
their
assistance
determined
in
accordance
with
state
needs.
the
petitioners
also
contended
the
regulation
invidiously
discriminates
against
the
needy
dependent
children
because
it
punishes
them
for
conduct
over
which
they
have
no
control.
they
in
no
way
were
guilty
of
mismanagement
or
in
no
way
created
the
crisis
at
hand.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
intended
beneficiary
of
the
entire
state’s
program
which
is
financed
by
the
federal
government
is
to
provide
financial
protection
for
the
needy
and
dependent
children.
congress
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
would
if
--
those
children
who
were
deprived
of
assistance
for
a
period
of
six
months
in
the
basis
of
parent’s
conduct
your
honor,
i
would
make
the
same
argument.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
state
chooses
to
whom
--
who
the
beneficiary
or
is
one
law
quick
character
was
the
conduit
of
the
assistance
is
going
to
be.
the
state
can
choose
the
parent
or
it
can
choose
some
other
relative
responsible
person
to
disperse
the
money
on
behalf
of
the
intended
beneficiary
which
is
the
child.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
think
the
sole
aim
of
the
assistance
program
was
to
protect
the
dependent
child.
as
further
evidence
of
that
your
honor,
congress
has
recognized
that
mismanagement
can
be
a
problem.
we
don’t
argue
for
a
moment
that
everybody
who
requires
a
duplicate
rent
payment
has
in
fact
mismanaged
a
grant.
we
say
that
it
doesn’t
necessarily
require
that
when
the
fact
show
that.
but
congress
has
said,
“mismanagement
is
a
problem
and
has
established
non-punitive
measures
to
provide
with
that
problem.
one
being
a
restricted
check
so
that
the
parent
is
not
free
to
spend
the
check
anyway
they
choose
but
has
to
use
it
for
intended
purpose.”
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
your
honor,
there
is
--
and
hew
has
said
so
in
a
brief
that
they
filed
as
an
amicus
in
the
lower
court.
hew
said
there
is
ample
provision
for
new
york
state
to
deal
with
this
particular
crisis,
for
that
resort
to
a
recoupment
regulation.
and
one
of
that
--
and
what
that
remedy
is
emergency
assistance
which
doesn’t
require
repayment
on
the
part
of
the
parent.
it’s
given
--
it
could
only
be
given
only
once
during
a
12-month
period
to
resolve
the
crisis.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
assistance
would
be
paid
by
the
state
with
reimbursement
by
the
federal
government.
in
fact,
it’s
a
measure
that
congress
particularly
enacted,
i
think
it
was
1966
because
they
were
concerned
too
with
the
problems
of
mismanagement.
they
wanted
to
deal
with
it
in
a
rehabilitated
ways
rather
than
in
punitive
ways.
this
regulation
is
a
--
as
i
feel
is
a
punitive
measure
that
deals
with
the
problem.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
punitive
because
again,
if
we
are
to
assume
that
the
intended
beneficiary
of
the
payment
is
a
child,
the
dependent
child
because
it
penalizes
the
child
for
conduct
over
which
the
child
has
no
control.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes.
certainly,
family
disrupted
would
suffer.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
precariously,
under
the
new
york
state
where
--
and
the
record
indicates
is
where
a
family
is
actually
evicted
and
rehoused
by
the
state
in
a
motel,
the
state,
because
they
haven’t
paid
their
rent
and
rehoused
them
in
a
motel.
the
state
does
an
exact
--
the
recoupment
from
the
recipient
they
need
to
be
--
the
motel
of
course,
just
pay
them
full,
that
[voice
overlap]
payment.
and
the
family
continues
to
receive
the
full
benefits
of
the
grant
so
the
state
hasn’t
even
treated
all
whom
they
alleged
are
mismanaged
the
same
way.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
then
i
feel
that
they
will
not
--
to
answer
your
question,
they
would
not
--
they
would
not
be
adversely
affected
by
determination
that
the
regulation
is
in
violation
of
the
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no,
your
honor
and
hew
said
that
and
they
agreed.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
district
court
has
determined
the
claim
--
the
social
security
act
claimed
on
the
merits.
the
district
court
never
addressed
itself
to
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
claim
beyond
merely
saying
and
finding
that
it
was
substantial.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
are
jurisdictional
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
jurisdictional
questions.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
thought
judge
blackmun’s
question
meant,
if
we
ultimately
prevailed,
what
would
be
the
impact
in
the
united
states
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no,
in
this
court,
no,
that’s
quite
true.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
jurisdictional
(voice
overlap)
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no,
you
haven’t
misunderstood
the
briefs.
perhaps
i
misunderstood
the
question,
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
what
would
happen
if
this
regulation
is
ultimately
struck
down,
what
would
the
significance
of
it
be?
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no,
in
the
circuit
court
the
argument
centered
around
whether
or
not
the
equal
protection
claim
was
a
nonfrivolous
claim
for
jurisdictional
purposes
and
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no
your
honor,
it
did
not.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
lower
court
had
found
jurisdiction,
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
second
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
there
was
a
first
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
unanimously
found
jurisdiction
citing
1343
(3)
as
a
basis
for
jurisdiction
in
carter
v.
stanton.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
state
attacked
the
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
of
the
lack
of
a
substantial
constitutional
claim
and
we
responded
on
that
basis
your
honor.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
court
of
appeals?
the
second
court
of
appeals
panel?
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
second
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
second
court
of
appeals
panel
determined
that
on
the
facts
as
disclosed
in
the
pleadings
failed
to
present
a
substantial
constitutional
claim.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
we
allege
that
there
was
jurisdiction
under
1343
(3)
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case?
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
we
argue
that
the
court
below
erroneously
concluded
that
the
by
an
erroneous
application
of
the
standard
of
determining
substantiality
of
the
constitutional
claim,
that
this
claim
was
frivolous.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
constitutional
claims
are
frivolous,
only
if
so
attenuate
as
to
be
without
merit
or
its
unsound
or
so
clearly
result
from
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court
so
as
to
foreclose
the
possibility
that
it
could
be
a
subject
of
controversy.
recently
in
the
case
goosby
v.
osser
this
court
interpreted
the
phrase
wholly
without
merit
in
the
context
of
prior
decisions
and
determined
that
constitutional
claims
are
frivolous
only
if
they’re
inescapably
foreclosed
by
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
the
court
below
cited
no
controlling
authority
that
forecloses
this
constitutional
claim.
the
court
appears
to
have
based
its
finding
that
the
equal
protection
claim
was
insubstantial
on
the
basis
of
this
court’s
holding
at
dandridge
v.
williams.
we
submit
that
the
case
of
dandridge
v.
williams
is
not
dispositive
of
the
threshold
question
of
jurisdiction.
dandridge
determines
the
appropriate
standards
to
apply
to
a
equal
protection
challenge
in
the
area
of
social
welfare
legislation.
recently,
the
state
argues
that
dandridge
be
given
a
broad
sweeping
application
so
as
to
foreclose
any
equal
protection
challenges
in
the
area
of
social
welfare
legislation.
recent
decisions
of
the
court
suggest
that
no
such
gross
sweeping
application
has
in
fact
been
given
to
dandridge
or
should
be
given.
in
the
case
of
carter
v.
stanton
is
a
case
in
point.
in
carter
v.
stanton,
the
plaintiffs
challenged
an
indiana
welfare
statute
on
both
statutory
and
equal
protection
grounds.
the
district
court
found
that
the
equal
protection
argument
was
foreclosed
by
this
court’s
holding
in
dandridge.
on
appeal,
this
court
found
jurisdiction
at
citing
dandridge
in
support
of
its
finding
of
constitutional
substantiality.
we
maintain
that
whether
or
not
the
district
court
properly
concluded
that
the
constitutional
claim
is
insubstantial,
that
there
was
independent
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
social
security
act
claims
under
both
1343
and
1343
(4).
since
this
action
was
founded
on
a
violation
of
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
act.
section
1983
is
an
act
of
congress
providing
for
equal
rights
of
citizens
within
meaning,
also
that
on
two
basis
that
1983
is
an
act
providing
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights
within
the
meaning
of
1343
(3)
and
that
1983
is
an
act
providing
for
equal
rights
within
the
meaning
of
1343
(4).
section
8,
1983
provides
for
civil

privilege
or

secured

in
this

petitioner
seeks
to
redress

to
them
secured
by
federal
law,
namely
the
social

act.
and
while
petitioners
may
not
have

in
some
absolute
sense
to
a

of

mr.
carl

1331.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes.
i
don’t
think
that
they
would
satisfy
the
monetary
requirements
of
1331.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
it
was
never
raised
as
a
defense
to
or
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
but
then
we
would
--
it
would
be
available,
if
we
could
demonstrate
that
we
satisfy
the
monetary
requirements.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
we
cannot
satisfy
the
monetary
requirements
on
it.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
that’s
correct.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
1343,
--
this
court
has
often
observed
judicial
construction
of
a
statute
begins
by
looking
at
the
words
of
the
statute
itself.
the
words
of
1343
(4)
are
clear
and
leave
no
room
for
doubt.
we
believe
that
claims
brought
under
1983
were
intended
to
be
covered
by
1343
(4).
in
lynch
v.
household
finance
corp.,
this
court
held
that
congress
intended
to
give
broad
sweeping
protection
to
basic
civil
rights
by
the
enactment
of
1983.
the
right
to
enjoy
property,
being
one
of
those
rights,
whether
that
property
be
a
home,
a
savings
account
or
even
a
welfare
check,
just
as
a
right
not
to
be
deprived
of
property
without
due
process
of
law
is
a
right
secured
by
the
constitution.
we
maintain
so
then
the
right
to
receive
benefits
provided
by
the
social
security
act
is
a
civil
right
within
the
meaning
of
1343.
and
this
--
the
court
has
recently
recognized
in
moor
v.
county
of
alameda
that
1983
is
an
act
which
protects
civil
rights
within
the
meaning
of
1343
(4).
other
courts
specifically
addressing
themselves
to
this
question
have
reached
the
same
conclusion.
only
the
second
circuit
has
rejected
1343
(4)
jurisdiction,
but
has
done
so
without
any
rationale
or
reasoning
for
its
determination.
in
the
court
below,
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
and
1343
(4)
jurisdiction
but
dismissed
the
case
on
the
basis
of
almenares
v.
wyman.
almenares
v.
wyman,
a
second
circuit
case
determined
that
there
was
jurisdiction
because
of
a
substantial
constitutional
claim
but
in
dicta
reject
the
1343
(4)
jurisdiction.
citing,
mccall
v.
shapiro.
mccall
v.
shapiro
did
discuss
1343
(4)
jurisdiction,
found
no
basis
for
jurisdiction
but
did
so
on
the
basis
of
the
personal
liberties
property
rights
distinction
which
this
court
was
later
to
reject
the
lynch
v.
household
finance,
thus
it's
clear
that
the
second
circuit
has
yet
to
come
up
with
any
convincing
rationale
for
rejecting
1343
(4)
jurisdiction
to
1983
suits.
the
state
argues
that
the
one
roadblock
to
jurisdiction,
to
1343
(4)
jurisdiction
is
a
brief
description
in
a
house
report
accompanying
the
bill
which
describes
it
as
merely
a
technical
amendment
to
a
proceeding
section
of
law.
we
submit
that
that
limited
view
is
not
accurate
since
the
proceeding
section
of
law
to
which
it
was
--
to
which
it
refers
was
specifically
eliminated
by
floor
amendment
and
was
not
enacted
into
law.
even
had
that
section
been
enacted
in
to
law,
it’s
clear
that
the
plain
words
of
1343
(4)
go
far
beyond
the
ascribed
purpose
of
the
committee.
congress
surely
intended
the
act
to
mean
something
that
would
--
the
senate
would
not
have
passed
the
section
of
law
to
refer
to
a
preceding
section
that
knowingly
rejected
some
further
indication
of
the
purpose
of
1343
(4)
can
be
gleaned
from
the
very
title
itself
which
is
an
act
to
strengthen
civil
rights
enforcement.
it's
only
if
the
interpretation
that
we
suggest
be
given
to
it
that
it
can
be
considered
an
act
enlarging
and
enhancing
federal
civil
rights
importance.
this
court
has
already
interpreted
1343
(4)
as
expansive
of
federal
jurisdiction.
in
the
case
of
jones
v.
alfred
h.
mayer,
a
private
corporation
was
sued
for
discrimination
and
refusing
to
sell
a
home
to
a
person
because
he
was
a
negro.
1343
(4)
was
the
only
statute
available
to
provide
jurisdiction
over
a
private
suit.
the
supreme
court
in
the
1982,
this
court
found
jurisdiction
under
1343
(4).
if
the
state
is
correct
that
1343
(4)
is
too
technical
a
provision
to
provide
jurisdiction
to
1983,
it
surely
would
be
too
technical
to
provide
jurisdiction
for
1343
(4).
we
submit
further
that
1343
(3)
provides
an
independent
basis
for
jurisdiction.
1343
(3)
and
1983
were
intended
so
the
legislative
history
shows
to
be
coextensive
in
scope
and
that
congress
never
intended
to
create
any
gap
between
the
two.
moreover,
1983
is
an
act
that
protects
equal
rights
since
it
guarantees
a
federal
forum
--
equal
access
to
a
federal
forum
to
secure
those
rights,
secured
by
federal
law.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
think
your
honor,
in
response
to
your
question
that
congress
often
uses
different
language
in
the
same
act
to
have
different
shades
of
meaning.
the
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
think
that
the
equal
rights
language
is
not
limited
to
suit
upon
racial
equality.
the
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
i
am.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
you’re
correct
in
your
recollection
of
the
case.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
georgia
v.
rachel
involved
1443,
a
removal
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
(voice
overlap)
--
removal
statute.
removal
statutes
origin
can
be
traced
to
the
thirteenth
amendment
which
was
an
act
to
eradicate
the
badges
of
slavery.
1983
on
the
other
hand
has
its
origin
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
has
not
been
interpreted
and
limited
solely
to
racial
discrimination
cases
but
has
given
interpretation
far
beyond
that.
the
court
construed
1443
(1)
in
a
narrow
way
because
of
the
removal
section
divesting
and
removes
a
case
from
the
state
court
system.
it
deprives
the
court
of
the
power
to
decide
the
case.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
it’s
a
source
for
a
possible
friction
between
two
sovereignties
that
being
so,
the
court
gave
it
a
narrow
construction.
we
submit
that
the
legislative
history
of
1983
doesn’t
require
and
certainly
demands
a
more
expansive
interpretation
as
this
court
has
already
interpreted
1983
to
apply
to
a
full
gamut
of
federally
protected
rights,
not
just
those
limited
in
terms
of
racial
equality.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
1343
(3)
and
1983
derived
from
the
same
statute.
at
the
very
outset,
there
was
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
to
create
federal
jurisdiction
over
all
1983
actions
without
distinction.
i
think
that
--
it’s
because
of
the
history
of
the
two
sections
together
that
we
make
the
argument
that
it
should
be
given
coextensive
application.
there
was
no
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
to
create
a
gap
between
the
creation
of
a
federal
right
and
a
forum
where
that
right
to
be
heard.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
substantially,
technically
yes.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
second
circuit
did
not
determine
this
case
on
the
merits.
the
court
concluded
that
because
the
complaint
failed
to
plead
a
substantial
constitutional
question,
the
district
court
was
without
pendent
jurisdiction
to
determine
as
it
did
at
the
new
york
welfare
regulation
violated
the
social
security
act.
because
of
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case
therefore,
two
questions
are
presented
to
this
court.
the
first
question
is
a
narrow
one,
whether
the
pleadings
raised
nonfrivolous
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
pendent
question
was
whether
or
not
the
new
york
welfare
regulation
violated
the
social
security
act.
there
is
a
social
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
well,
i
don’t
think
you
need
to
resort
to
pendent
jurisdiction,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
lower
court
determined
that
the
district
court
lack
jurisdiction
to
pass
upon
that
pendent
claim
because
of
the
absence
of
a
substantial
constitutional
claim.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
it
would
not
be
pendent,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
well,
your
honor
before
the
court
can
determine
whether
or
not
it’s
correctly
to
determine,
to
characterize
that
as
a
pendent
claim,
i
would
first
have
to
pass
upon
the
second
aspect
of
our
argument
which
is
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
which
is
that
absent
a
constitutional
claim,
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
under
1343
(3)
and
1343
(4)
of
an
action
founded
on
1983
of
the
civil
rights
act
to
determine
the
social
security
act
claim
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
think
that
any
time
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no
your
honor,
i
don’t.
and
believe
there
is
independent
federal
jurisdiction
to
determine
that
claim.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
contend
your
honor
that
the
social
security
act
is
one
of
the
laws
described
by
section
1983
and
when
a
state
acts
to
deprive
a
citizen
of
--
a
right,
federal
rights
or
the
color
of
state
law
that
therefore
there’s
jurisdiction
to
hear
that
remedy
under
1343
and
1343
(4).
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
it
would
be
a
constitutional
claim
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
we
didn’t
raise
it
in
the
terms
of
the
supremacy
clause
being
the
constitutional
basis.
although
in
fact
that
is
true
that
that
isn’t
a
basis
but
we
didn’t
raise
it
in
the
lower
court.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no
your
honor,
except
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
under
supremacy
clause.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
in
1971,
the
new
york
state
department
of
social
services
promulgated
regulation
352.7
(g)
(7)
of
title
18
of
the
new
york
code
of
rules
and
regulations.
that
regulation
was
submitted
to
hew
for
approval.
hew
on
several
occasions
notified
me
that
that
regulation
fails
to
satisfy
federal
requirements.
not
withstanding
such
noncompliance,
new
york
state
continued
to
give
the
regulations,
statewide
application
and
continues
to
receive
federal
funds.
the
regulation
is
known
as
the
recoupment
regulation.
it
permits
the
local
--
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
think
1983
was
intended
to
grant
that
type
of
remedy
where
a
state
deprives
one
or
other
federal
right
that
1983
covers
a
full
gamut
of
federal
rights.
and
it
was
intended
unless
congress
has
expressly
limited
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
to
hear
that
type
of
claim
your
honor
that
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
federal
right
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
1983
--
constitutional
and
laws,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
your
honor.
the
recoupment
regulation
permits
a
local
department
of
social
services
to
provide
a
duplicate
rent
payment
to
a
recipient
of
public
assistance
who
is
threatened
with
eviction
for
nonpayment
of
rent
but
mandates
that
that
duplicate
rent
payment
be
recouped
over
the
next
six
months
in
equal
amounts.
in
very
practical
terms,
the
rent
recoupment
regulation
solves
the
immediate
crisis
but
creates
a
far
more
serious
crisis
since
during
the
period
of
the
recoupment,
the
family
is
deprived
of
the
very
means
to
sustain
themselves,
to
feed,
clothe
or
shelter
--
to
house
themselves.
the
state
argues
that
this
rent
recoupment
regulation
turns
on
--
is
designed
to
deter
mismanagement.
as
the
record
demonstrates,
the
recoupment
regulation
does
not
turn
on
mismanagement.
petitioner
hagans
and
his
two
children
reside
in
the
county
with
an
acute
housing
shortage.
the
state
has
conceded
that
petitioner
wasn’t
able
to
secure
housing
within
the
rent
schedule.
petitioner
received
a
shelter
allowance
from
the
local
department
of
social
services
in
the
amount
of
$165.00.
she
was
unable
to
find
housing
at
that
allowance.
she
therefore
was
--
she
then
found
housing
in
the
amount
of
$200.00
per
month.
the
local
agency
approved
that
housing.
she
was
simply
unable
to
continue
making
the
rent
payments
with
the
moneys
intended
to
her
other
basic
needs
and
with
that
period
of
time,
fell
into
arrears.
and
she
was
evicted.
she
was
rehoused
by
the
department
in
the
neighboring
county.
the
money
used
to
rehouse
her
was
then
deducted
in
full
from
the
next
months
grant
leaving
a
family
of
three
with
worth
$17.00
for
the
entire
months
needs.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
she
was
homeless
your
honor.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
she
found
the
housing.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
she
did.
the
recoupment
regulation
is
implemented
with
or
without
consent
of
the
recipient.
in
the
case
of
two
of
the
named
petitioners,
the
local
department
social
services
paid
the
rent
directly
to
the
landlord
to
forestall
a
nonpayment
proceeding
without
the
prior
consent
or
even
knowledge
of
the
recipient
and
then
recouped
the
money
from
the
subsequent
months
grant.
so
it
doesn’t
really
turn
on
the
consent
of
the
recipient
or
knowledge
of
the
recipient
either.
and
in
those
two
cases,
the
recipients
had
not
paid
rent
--
in
one
of
those
cases
the
recipient
had
not
paid
rent
because
she
was
protesting
the
failure
of
the
landlord
to
make
repairs.
so
in
effect,
the
recoupment
regulation
of
fraud
were
an
opportunity
to
even
assert
that
defense.
in
the
complaint
filed
in
the
district
court,
petitioners
asserted
three
basic
claims.
they
asserted
an
equal
protection
claim
alleging
that
the
rent
recoupment
regulation
irrationally
creates
two
classes
of
needy
dependent
children
in
new
york
state.
children
whose
parents
require
an
emergency
rent
payment
are
deprived
of
their
right
to
have
their
grant
determined
in
accordance
with
the
state
standard
of
need
while
other
children
who
receive
assistance
under
the
program
have
their
assistance
determined
in
accordance
with
state
needs.
the
petitioners
also
contended
the
regulation
invidiously
discriminates
against
the
needy
dependent
children
because
it
punishes
them
for
conduct
over
which
they
have
no
control.
they
in
no
way
were
guilty
of
mismanagement
or
in
no
way
created
the
crisis
at
hand.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
intended
beneficiary
of
the
entire
state’s
program
which
is
financed
by
the
federal
government
is
to
provide
financial
protection
for
the
needy
and
dependent
children.
congress
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
would
if
--
those
children
who
were
deprived
of
assistance
for
a
period
of
six
months
in
the
basis
of
parent’s
conduct
your
honor,
i
would
make
the
same
argument.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
state
chooses
to
whom
--
who
the
beneficiary
or
is
one
law
quick
character
was
the
conduit
of
the
assistance
is
going
to
be.
the
state
can
choose
the
parent
or
it
can
choose
some
other
relative
responsible
person
to
disperse
the
money
on
behalf
of
the
intended
beneficiary
which
is
the
child.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
think
the
sole
aim
of
the
assistance
program
was
to
protect
the
dependent
child.
as
further
evidence
of
that
your
honor,
congress
has
recognized
that
mismanagement
can
be
a
problem.
we
don’t
argue
for
a
moment
that
everybody
who
requires
a
duplicate
rent
payment
has
in
fact
mismanaged
a
grant.
we
say
that
it
doesn’t
necessarily
require
that
when
the
fact
show
that.
but
congress
has
said,
“mismanagement
is
a
problem
and
has
established
non-punitive
measures
to
provide
with
that
problem.
one
being
a
restricted
check
so
that
the
parent
is
not
free
to
spend
the
check
anyway
they
choose
but
has
to
use
it
for
intended
purpose.”
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
your
honor,
there
is
--
and
hew
has
said
so
in
a
brief
that
they
filed
as
an
amicus
in
the
lower
court.
hew
said
there
is
ample
provision
for
new
york
state
to
deal
with
this
particular
crisis,
for
that
resort
to
a
recoupment
regulation.
and
one
of
that
--
and
what
that
remedy
is
emergency
assistance
which
doesn’t
require
repayment
on
the
part
of
the
parent.
it’s
given
--
it
could
only
be
given
only
once
during
a
12-month
period
to
resolve
the
crisis.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
assistance
would
be
paid
by
the
state
with
reimbursement
by
the
federal
government.
in
fact,
it’s
a
measure
that
congress
particularly
enacted,
i
think
it
was
1966
because
they
were
concerned
too
with
the
problems
of
mismanagement.
they
wanted
to
deal
with
it
in
a
rehabilitated
ways
rather
than
in
punitive
ways.
this
regulation
is
a
--
as
i
feel
is
a
punitive
measure
that
deals
with
the
problem.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
punitive
because
again,
if
we
are
to
assume
that
the
intended
beneficiary
of
the
payment
is
a
child,
the
dependent
child
because
it
penalizes
the
child
for
conduct
over
which
the
child
has
no
control.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes.
certainly,
family
disrupted
would
suffer.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
precariously,
under
the
new
york
state
where
--
and
the
record
indicates
is
where
a
family
is
actually
evicted
and
rehoused
by
the
state
in
a
motel,
the
state,
because
they
haven’t
paid
their
rent
and
rehoused
them
in
a
motel.
the
state
does
an
exact
--
the
recoupment
from
the
recipient
they
need
to
be
--
the
motel
of
course,
just
pay
them
full,
that
[voice
overlap]
payment.
and
the
family
continues
to
receive
the
full
benefits
of
the
grant
so
the
state
hasn’t
even
treated
all
whom
they
alleged
are
mismanaged
the
same
way.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
then
i
feel
that
they
will
not
--
to
answer
your
question,
they
would
not
--
they
would
not
be
adversely
affected
by
determination
that
the
regulation
is
in
violation
of
the
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no,
your
honor
and
hew
said
that
and
they
agreed.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
district
court
has
determined
the
claim
--
the
social
security
act
claimed
on
the
merits.
the
district
court
never
addressed
itself
to
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
claim
beyond
merely
saying
and
finding
that
it
was
substantial.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
are
jurisdictional
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
jurisdictional
questions.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
thought
judge
blackmun’s
question
meant,
if
we
ultimately
prevailed,
what
would
be
the
impact
in
the
united
states
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no,
in
this
court,
no,
that’s
quite
true.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
jurisdictional
(voice
overlap)
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no,
you
haven’t
misunderstood
the
briefs.
perhaps
i
misunderstood
the
question,
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
what
would
happen
if
this
regulation
is
ultimately
struck
down,
what
would
the
significance
of
it
be?
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no,
in
the
circuit
court
the
argument
centered
around
whether
or
not
the
equal
protection
claim
was
a
nonfrivolous
claim
for
jurisdictional
purposes
and
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no
your
honor,
it
did
not.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
lower
court
had
found
jurisdiction,
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
second
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
there
was
a
first
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
unanimously
found
jurisdiction
citing
1343
(3)
as
a
basis
for
jurisdiction
in
carter
v.
stanton.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
state
attacked
the
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
of
the
lack
of
a
substantial
constitutional
claim
and
we
responded
on
that
basis
your
honor.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
court
of
appeals?
the
second
court
of
appeals
panel?
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
second
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
the
second
court
of
appeals
panel
determined
that
on
the
facts
as
disclosed
in
the
pleadings
failed
to
present
a
substantial
constitutional
claim.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
we
allege
that
there
was
jurisdiction
under
1343
(3)
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
no,
your
honor.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case?
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
we
argue
that
the
court
below
erroneously
concluded
that
the
by
an
erroneous
application
of
the
standard
of
determining
substantiality
of
the
constitutional
claim,
that
this
claim
was
frivolous.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
constitutional
claims
are
frivolous,
only
if
so
attenuate
as
to
be
without
merit
or
its
unsound
or
so
clearly
result
from
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court
so
as
to
foreclose
the
possibility
that
it
could
be
a
subject
of
controversy.
recently
in
the
case
goosby
v.
osser
this
court
interpreted
the
phrase
wholly
without
merit
in
the
context
of
prior
decisions
and
determined
that
constitutional
claims
are
frivolous
only
if
they’re
inescapably
foreclosed
by
prior
decisions
of
this
court.
the
court
below
cited
no
controlling
authority
that
forecloses
this
constitutional
claim.
the
court
appears
to
have
based
its
finding
that
the
equal
protection
claim
was
insubstantial
on
the
basis
of
this
court’s
holding
at
dandridge
v.
williams.
we
submit
that
the
case
of
dandridge
v.
williams
is
not
dispositive
of
the
threshold
question
of
jurisdiction.
dandridge
determines
the
appropriate
standards
to
apply
to
a
equal
protection
challenge
in
the
area
of
social
welfare
legislation.
recently,
the
state
argues
that
dandridge
be
given
a
broad
sweeping
application
so
as
to
foreclose
any
equal
protection
challenges
in
the
area
of
social
welfare
legislation.
recent
decisions
of
the
court
suggest
that
no
such
gross
sweeping
application
has
in
fact
been
given
to
dandridge
or
should
be
given.
in
the
case
of
carter
v.
stanton
is
a
case
in
point.
in
carter
v.
stanton,
the
plaintiffs
challenged
an
indiana
welfare
statute
on
both
statutory
and
equal
protection
grounds.
the
district
court
found
that
the
equal
protection
argument
was
foreclosed
by
this
court’s
holding
in
dandridge.
on
appeal,
this
court
found
jurisdiction
at
citing
dandridge
in
support
of
its
finding
of
constitutional
substantiality.
we
maintain
that
whether
or
not
the
district
court
properly
concluded
that
the
constitutional
claim
is
insubstantial,
that
there
was
independent
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
social
security
act
claims
under
both
1343
and
1343
(4).
since
this
action
was
founded
on
a
violation
of
section
1983
of
the
civil
rights
act.
section
1983
is
an
act
of
congress
providing
for
equal
rights
of
citizens
within
meaning,
also
that
on
two
basis
that
1983
is
an
act
providing
for
the
protection
of
civil
rights
within
the
meaning
of
1343
(3)
and
that
1983
is
an
act
providing
for
equal
rights
within
the
meaning
of
1343
(4).
section
8,
1983
provides
for
civil
actions
to
redress
deprivations
on
the
color
of
state
law
of
any
privilege
right
--
privilege
or
immunity
secured
by
the
constitution
and
laws.
in
this
case
petitioner
seeks
to
redress
rights
to
them
secured
by
federal
law,
namely
the
social
security
act.
and
while
petitioners
may
not
have
a
right
in
some
absolute
sense
to
a
level
of
benefits
or
any
benefits
at
all,
they
do
have
a
right
so
long
as
new
york
state
continues
to
receive
federal
funds
to
have
their
eligibility
determine
in
accordance
with
federal
standards.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
1331.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes.
i
don’t
think
that
they
would
satisfy
the
monetary
requirements
of
1331.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
it
was
never
raised
as
a
defense
to
or
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
but
then
we
would
--
it
would
be
available,
if
we
could
demonstrate
that
we
satisfy
the
monetary
requirements.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
we
cannot
satisfy
the
monetary
requirements
on
it.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
that’s
correct.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
1343,
--
this
court
has
often
observed
judicial
construction
of
a
statute
begins
by
looking
at
the
words
of
the
statute
itself.
the
words
of
1343
(4)
are
clear
and
leave
no
room
for
doubt.
we
believe
that
claims
brought
under
1983
were
intended
to
be
covered
by
1343
(4).
in
lynch
v.
household
finance
corp.,
this
court
held
that
congress
intended
to
give
broad
sweeping
protection
to
basic
civil
rights
by
the
enactment
of
1983.
the
right
to
enjoy
property,
being
one
of
those
rights,
whether
that
property
be
a
home,
a
savings
account
or
even
a
welfare
check,
just
as
a
right
not
to
be
deprived
of
property
without
due
process
of
law
is
a
right
secured
by
the
constitution.
we
maintain
so
then
the
right
to
receive
benefits
provided
by
the
social
security
act
is
a
civil
right
within
the
meaning
of
1343.
and
this
--
the
court
has
recently
recognized
in
moor
v.
county
of
alameda
that
1983
is
an
act
which
protects
civil
rights
within
the
meaning
of
1343
(4).
other
courts
specifically
addressing
themselves
to
this
question
have
reached
the
same
conclusion.
only
the
second
circuit
has
rejected
1343
(4)
jurisdiction,
but
has
done
so
without
any
rationale
or
reasoning
for
its
determination.
in
the
court
below,
the
court
concluded
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
and
1343
(4)
jurisdiction
but
dismissed
the
case
on
the
basis
of
almenares
v.
wyman.
almenares
v.
wyman,
a
second
circuit
case
determined
that
there
was
jurisdiction
because
of
a
substantial
constitutional
claim
but
in
dicta
reject
the
1343
(4)
jurisdiction.
citing,
mccall
v.
shapiro.
mccall
v.
shapiro
did
discuss
1343
(4)
jurisdiction,
found
no
basis
for
jurisdiction
but
did
so
on
the
basis
of
the
personal
liberties
property
rights
distinction
which
this
court
was
later
to
reject
the
lynch
v.
household
finance,
thus
it's
clear
that
the
second
circuit
has
yet
to
come
up
with
any
convincing
rationale
for
rejecting
1343
(4)
jurisdiction
to
1983
suits.
the
state
argues
that
the
one
roadblock
to
jurisdiction,
to
1343
(4)
jurisdiction
is
a
brief
description
in
a
house
report
accompanying
the
bill
which
describes
it
as
merely
a
technical
amendment
to
a
proceeding
section
of
law.
we
submit
that
that
limited
view
is
not
accurate
since
the
proceeding
section
of
law
to
which
it
was
--
to
which
it
refers
was
specifically
eliminated
by
floor
amendment
and
was
not
enacted
into
law.
even
had
that
section
been
enacted
in
to
law,
it’s
clear
that
the
plain
words
of
1343
(4)
go
far
beyond
the
ascribed
purpose
of
the
committee.
congress
surely
intended
the
act
to
mean
something
that
would
--
the
senate
would
not
have
passed
the
section
of
law
to
refer
to
a
preceding
section
that
knowingly
rejected
some
further
indication
of
the
purpose
of
1343
(4)
can
be
gleaned
from
the
very
title
itself
which
is
an
act
to
strengthen
civil
rights
enforcement.
it's
only
if
the
interpretation
that
we
suggest
be
given
to
it
that
it
can
be
considered
an
act
enlarging
and
enhancing
federal
civil
rights
importance.
this
court
has
already
interpreted
1343
(4)
as
expansive
of
federal
jurisdiction.
in
the
case
of
jones
v.
alfred
h.
mayer,
a
private
corporation
was
sued
for
discrimination
and
refusing
to
sell
a
home
to
a
person
because
he
was
a
negro.
1343
(4)
was
the
only
statute
available
to
provide
jurisdiction
over
a
private
suit.
the
supreme
court
in
the
1982,
this
court
found
jurisdiction
under
1343
(4).
if
the
state
is
correct
that
1343
(4)
is
too
technical
a
provision
to
provide
jurisdiction
to
1983,
it
surely
would
be
too
technical
to
provide
jurisdiction
for
1343
(4).
we
submit
further
that
1343
(3)
provides
an
independent
basis
for
jurisdiction.
1343
(3)
and
1983
were
intended
so
the
legislative
history
shows
to
be
coextensive
in
scope
and
that
congress
never
intended
to
create
any
gap
between
the
two.
moreover,
1983
is
an
act
that
protects
equal
rights
since
it
guarantees
a
federal
forum
--
equal
access
to
a
federal
forum
to
secure
those
rights,
secured
by
federal
law.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
think
your
honor,
in
response
to
your
question
that
congress
often
uses
different
language
in
the
same
act
to
have
different
shades
of
meaning.
the
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
i
think
that
the
equal
rights
language
is
not
limited
to
suit
upon
racial
equality.
the
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
i
am.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
you’re
correct
in
your
recollection
of
the
case.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
georgia
v.
rachel
involved
1443,
a
removal
--
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
(voice
overlap)
--
removal
statute.
removal
statutes
origin
can
be
traced
to
the
thirteenth
amendment
which
was
an
act
to
eradicate
the
badges
of
slavery.
1983
on
the
other
hand
has
its
origin
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
which
has
not
been
interpreted
and
limited
solely
to
racial
discrimination
cases
but
has
given
interpretation
far
beyond
that.
the
court
construed
1443
(1)
in
a
narrow
way
because
of
the
removal
section
divesting
and
removes
a
case
from
the
state
court
system.
it
deprives
the
court
of
the
power
to
decide
the
case.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
it’s
a
source
for
a
possible
friction
between
two
sovereignties
that
being
so,
the
court
gave
it
a
narrow
construction.
we
submit
that
the
legislative
history
of
1983
doesn’t
require
and
certainly
demands
a
more
expansive
interpretation
as
this
court
has
already
interpreted
1983
to
apply
to
a
full
gamut
of
federally
protected
rights,
not
just
those
limited
in
terms
of
racial
equality.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
1343
(3)
and
1983
derived
from
the
same
statute.
at
the
very
outset,
there
was
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
to
create
federal
jurisdiction
over
all
1983
actions
without
distinction.
i
think
that
--
it’s
because
of
the
history
of
the
two
sections
together
that
we
make
the
argument
that
it
should
be
given
coextensive
application.
there
was
no
intention
on
the
part
of
congress
to
create
a
gap
between
the
creation
of
a
federal
right
and
a
forum
where
that
right
to
be
heard.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
substantially,
technically
yes.
mr.
carl
jay
nathanson
yes,
sir.
