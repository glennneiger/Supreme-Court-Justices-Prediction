justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
claim
that
the
federal
social
security
statute
then,
is
in
effect
one
of
the
laws
described
by
section
1343
as
enacted
to
protect
civil
rights?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
because
of
the
constitutional
supremacy
clause
but
just
because
the
federal
right
is
conferred
by
a
federal
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
she
rehoused
at
her
request?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
--
is
--
she
wanted
the
state
agency
to
do
that.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
say
punitive
just
because
it
gets
back
what
it
ultimately
paid
off?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
child
would've
suffered
if
there’d
actually
been
an
eviction
and
there’d
been
no
home
to
move
in
to,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what
would
--
so
the
state’s
action
is
really
to
prevent
that
sort
of
harm
to
the
child.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
not?
justice
william
h.
