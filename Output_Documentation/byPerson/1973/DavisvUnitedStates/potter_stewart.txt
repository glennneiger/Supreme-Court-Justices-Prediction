justice
potter
stewart
has
the
ninth
circuit
continued
to
follow
fox
since
the
fox
decision,
conceding
it
beside
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
the
son
of
gutknecht?
justice
potter
stewart
okay,
and
so
the
attorney
now
can
prosecute
him
for
refusing
an
order
to
take
a
physical
exam?
justice
potter
stewart
since
the
kind
of
a
situation?
justice
potter
stewart
what
have
the
other
circuit’s
done
with
the
fox
if
anything
--
justice
potter
stewart
in
fact?
justice
potter
stewart
but
except
for
fox,
batiste,
dobie,
except
for
batiste
and
dobie
in
those
two
circuits,
the
other
circuits
haven’t
dealt
with
it?
justice
potter
stewart
although
ordered
to
do
so.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
would
be
a
good
and
bona
fide
(inaudible)
on
a
wild
goose
chase,
but
what
would
be
a
good
and
bona
fide
reason
for
not
responding
to
a
direction
to
take
a
physical
exam?
justice
potter
stewart
in
fact
or
in
law?
justice
potter
stewart
for
two
years?
justice
potter
stewart
but
this
board
didn’t
get
any
request?
justice
potter
stewart
it
didn’t
get
any
request
from
the
registrant?
justice
potter
stewart
just
got
his
absence.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i
know
it
isn’t.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
it
doesn’t.
justice
potter
stewart
is
there
some
difference
of
opinion
between
you
and
your
brother
as
to
whether
the
gutknecht
was
a
constitutional
decision,
that
is
a
decision
based
upon
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
potter
stewart
okay,
fine.
justice
potter
stewart
because
there
were
not
authorized
by
the
statute
to
do
so,
was
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
that
was
the
basic
holding.
justice
potter
stewart
or
our
position
too,
you
have
two
positions
if
you
want
[voice
overlap]?
justice
potter
stewart
i
dispose
that
idea.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
justice
powell
dissented
in
schneckloth?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
mr.
kitch
a
criminal
offense
or
it’s
a
criminal
offense
to
willfully
fail
to
report
for
a
physical
examination,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
is
that
an
offense
of
the
same
gravity
in
terms
of
the
permissible
punishment
as
the
offense
of
failing
to
report
for
induction?
justice
potter
stewart
so
if
fox
remains
the
law,
the
government
could
simply
bring
the
charge
of
failing
to
report
of
the
physical
examination,
couldn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
but
wouldn’t
it
--
with
or
without
a
declaration
of
delinquency,
would
it
be
procedurally
proper
to
order
a
man
for
induction
who
haven’t
been
given
a
physical
examination
in
the
present
--
justice
potter
stewart
it
wouldn't?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is?
justice
potter
stewart
quite
apart
from
whether
or
not
he
disregarded
a
direction
to
show
up
for
a
physical?
justice
potter
stewart
7?
justice
potter
stewart
whoever
refused,
who
have
refused,
but
my
question
is
can
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
it’s
basically
the
same
provision,
isn’t
it
in
substance?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
but
for
a
person
who
hasn’t
refused,
it
violates
the
procedures
of
the
selective
service
act
to
call
a
person
for
induction
who
has
not
been
even
asked
to
have
physical
examination,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
continues
to
be
true.
justice
potter
stewart
as
it
was
true
at
the
time
of
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
of
mr.
davis’
induction
and
it
continues
to
be
true
that
as
it
was
at
the
time
of
his
induction
that
if
a
person
refuses
a
physical
examination,
he
can
then
nevertheless
be
called
for
induction.
the
only
difference
now
is
you
don’t
label
it
a
delinquency?
justice
potter
stewart
that
continues
to
be
true,
therefore
now
as
it
was
then
that
the
government
been
prosecuting
for
refusal
to
report
for
a
physical
examination.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
carries
the
same
penalty
you’ve
just
told
me
as
a
refusal
to
report
for
induction?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
he
cannot
be
prosecuted
i
suppose
if
he’s
found
physically
disabled.
he
cannot
then
be
prosecuted
even
though
he
has
absolutely
defied
a
previous
order
to
report
for
a
physical,
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
doesn’t
pass
his
physical.
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
a
case
that
is
here
by
way
of
grant
of
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
petitioner
joseph
anthony
davis
was
convicted
in
a
federal
district
court
in
california
for
violating
a
provision
of
the
selective
service
act,
and
his
conviction
was
thereafter
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
soon
thereafter,
in
another
very
similar
case,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
a
selective
service
act
conviction
on
the
ground
that
the
induction
order
on
which
that
conviction
was
based
was
not
authorized
by
the
law.
the
petitioner
davis
then
brought
this
proceeding
under
section
2255
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code
collaterally
attacking
his
conviction
upon
the
ground
that
under
the
law
of
this
circuit
has
changed
since
the
affirmance
of
his
conviction.
his
induction
order
had
been
unauthorized
and
that
his
conviction
was
therefore
invalid.
the
district
court
denied
relief
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
without
considering
the
merits
of
his
claim
on
the
ground
that
its
previous
decision
on
his
direct
appeal
or
as
the
law
of
the
case
and
that
the
court
would
not
therefore
consider
his
claim
that
there
had
subsequently
been
a
change
in
a
law
of
the
circuit
which
made
his
conviction
invalid.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
some
detail
in
the
court’s
written
opinion
today,
we
hold
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
in
error
in
holding
that
the
so-called
law
of
the
case
precluded
davis
from
securing
relief
under
section
2255
on
the
basis
of
an
intervening
change
in
law.
we
further
hold
that
the
issue
that
davis
raises
is
cognitable
in
a
proceeding
under
section
2255
of
title
28
of
the
united
states
code.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
has
the
ninth
circuit
continued
to
follow
fox
since
the
fox
decision,
conceding
it
beside
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
the
son
of
gutknecht?
justice
potter
stewart
okay,
and
so
the

can
