mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
for
review
of
the
ninth
circuit’s
denial
of
post
conviction
relief
under
28
u.s.c.
section
2255
to
petitioner
joseph
anthony
davis,
who
was
convicted
of
refusal
of
induction
into
the
armed
services.
it
is
conceded
that
he
was
ordered
to
report
as
a
delinquent
without
a
prior
physical
examination,
and
a
statement
of
acceptability
as
the
selective
service
regulations
required
for
all
persons
not
delinquents.
it
is
likewise
conceded
that
he
was
declared
delinquent
by
his
local
board
because
it
unilaterally
determined
that
he
did
not
comply
with
the
prior
order
to
report
for
a
physical
examination.
and
it
is
also
conceded
that,
but
for
his
delinquency
status,
he
could
not
have
been
ordered
to
report
for
induction
without
the
prior
pre-induction
physical
examination,
and
the
statement
of
acceptability
issued
at
least
21
days
before
the
induction
date.
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit
not
withstanding
and
argument
made
on
direct
appeal
that
his
delinquency
induction
order
was
invalid
under
the
doctrine
established
by
this
court
in
gutknecht
against
united
states.
while
petitioner’s
case
was
pending
before
this
court
on
certiorari,
a
change
in
the
law
occurred.
the
ninth
circuit
decided
united
states
against
fox,
a
case
concededly
identical
to
that
of
davis,
holding
what
the
gutknecht
doctrine
required
the
invalidation
of
delinquency
based
induction
orders
when
the
order
to
report
without
a
prior
physical
examination
and
statement
of
acceptability
was
based
upon
a
declaration
of
delinquency.
post
conviction
relief
was
sought
on
the
basis
of
this
intervening
fox
decision
and
denied
by
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit.
thus,
there
are
two
principle
questions,
may
it
please
the
court
in
this
case.
the
first
is
whether
post
conviction
relief
under
2255
is
available
when
there
has
been
an
intervening
change
in
the
law
to
the
2255
petitioner’s
benefit
and
a
case
concededly
identical
to
petitioner’s
case
on
the
facts
and
on
the
law
which
was
decided
after
appellate
affirmance
of
petitioner’s
conviction
and
while
a
prior
petition
for
certiorari
was
pending.
based
on,
i
respectfully
submit
some
unexplained
and
inexplicable
motion
of
law
of
the
case
which
is
totally
erroneous,
the
ninth
circuit
held
per
curiam
that
there
was
no
basis
for
2255
relief
because
petitioner’s
claim
had
been
advanced
albeit
unsuccessfully
in
the
absence
of
the
new
law
on
direct
appeal.
indeed,
the
change
in
the
law
occurred
four
months
after
the
direct
appeal.
the
government
has
apparently
confessed
error,
either
in
whole
or
in
part
on
this
point,
but
our
view
is
against
post
conviction
relief
for
other
reasons
which
we
respectfully
submit
are
equally
without
merit.
the
second
question,
of
course
and
perhaps
the
fundamental
question
is
whether
the
intervening
new
law
decision
in
united
states
against
fox
which
invalidated
a
species
of
delinquency
sanction
which
was
not
before
this
court
in
gutknecht,
the
sanction
of
induction
without
a
prior
pre
induction
physical
examination,
and
the
statement
of
acceptability
was
a
proper
interpretation
by
the
fox
court
of
this
court’s
decision
in
gutknecht
and
also
this
court’s
decision
in
oestereich.
gutknecht
and
oestereich
as
would
be
recalled
of
course
invalidated
somewhat
more
dramatic
species
of
delinquency
sanctions
than
that
involved
in
this
case.
now,
the
government
admits
that
davis,
this
case,
and
fox
are
utterly
inconsistent
which
the
ninth
circuit
again
astonishingly
refused
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
is
certainly
a
possible
solution
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
respectfully
suggest
that
since
that
if
fox
is
the
law
and
if
fox
is
correct,
that
a
remand
would
be
an
unnecessary
waste
of
judicial
time
on
the
part
of
the
ninth
circuit,
and
perhaps
i
even
fear
to
think
on
the
part
of
this
court,
because
this
case
has
been
in
the
ninth
circuit
on
three
occasions
and
these
very
arguments
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
ninth
circuit.
and
when
we
were
previously
here
on
certiorari,
indeed,
we
suggested
that
this
court
might
wish
to
remand
to
the
ninth
court
with
the
suggestion
for
reconsideration.
but
thus
far,
nothing
is
available.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
your
honor,
we
cite
in
our
brief
the
one
or
two
ninth
circuit
decisions
which
cite
and
follow
fox
and
we
find
no
others
and
none
depart
from
it.
if
i
may
represent
to
the
court
as
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
ninth
circuit,
i
have
been
informed
by
united
states
attorneys
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
it
is
the
uniform
prosecutorial
practice
to
act
as
the
fox
is
law.
indeed,
the
united
states
attorney
told
me
that
fox
is
considered
the
son
of
gutknecht.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes
your
honor,
yes
your
honor
which
of
course
is
the
very
gist
of
the
constitutional
defect
in
the
prosecution
here.
the
man
was
prosecuted
for
a
crime
of
which
he
did
not
have
constitutionally
committed
under
this
court’s
decision
in
the
gutknecht
case.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
it
is
hard
to
gleam
that
from
the
ninth
circuit’s
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
ninth
circuit
to
the
extent
that
it
said
anything
in
the
brief
opinion
which
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix
said
that
they
do
not
agree
that
fox
changed
the
law,
and
it
also
made
the
species
i
respectfully
suggest
of
the
case
argument.
but
of
course,
the
day
after
fox
or
the
same
day
as
fox,
another
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
case
of
zack
against
benson
applied
fox
obviously
retroactively
since
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes
your
honor,
and
in
our
reply
brief,
we
recite
the
statement
of
facts
from
zack
against
benson
which
makes
this
clear
and
i
am
sure
the
government
won’t
contest
it.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
your
honor,
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
batiste
case
presaged
fox,
presaged
the
ninth
circuit
and
announced
the
same
kind
of
per
se
decision,
reasoning
from
this
court’s
decision
in
gutknecht
that
even
though
it
might
be
interesting
to
speculate
on
whether
or
not
there
was
acceleration
in
fact,
we
believe
that
gutknecht
requires
us
to
hold
that
any
delinquency
based
induction
order
is
per
se
invalid,
that
is
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
batiste.
the
government
views
the
decision
somewhat
differently,
but
i’m
sure
your
honors
can
read
it.
the
fourth
circuit
in
dobie
took
a
somewhat
different
view.
the
fourth
circuit
in
dobie
stated
that
where
there
is
delinquency
based
induction
order,
there
is
a
heavy
burden
of
proof
upon
the
government
to
show
that
there
was
not
acceleration
in
fact.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes.
and
the
fourth
circuit
in
dobie
in
a
very
careful
decision
by
judge
butzner
pointed
out
the
only
proper
standards
which
can
be
used
to
overcome
this
heavy
burden
of
proof.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
an
alternative
ground
on
which
the
decision
below
must
be
reversed,
but
we
would
hope
that
it
would
be
reversed
on
fox
and
batiste
grounds
rather
than
on
dobie
grounds.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
no
your
honor.
there
are
various
decisions
of
district
courts,
but
i’m
not
aware
of
any
other
circuit
dealing
with
it.
of
course,
the
underlying
question
by
the
--
presented
by
this
case
is
the
scope
and
the
legal
significance
of
the
constitutional
holding
of
this
court
in
gutknecht.
i
believe
that
it
is
apparent
from
the
reading
of
the
gutknecht
decision
that
the
essential
holding
is
that
congress
never
vested
the
authority
to
induct
as
delinquents
in
either
the
president
or
the
selective
service
system,
and
that
any
such
standard
was
delegation
would
be
unconstitutional.
now,
as
i
noted
before,
the
case
has
been
to
the
ninth
circuit
three
times
into
this
court
twice,
consequently,
it
has
a
somewhat
elongated
history
which
we
try
to
set
forth
and
explicate
in
our
briefs.
but
the
essence,
the
essential
facts
which
provided
the
basic
legal
posture
of
the
case
is
that
the
local
board
in
the
effect
accused
petitioner
of
failing
without
reasonable
excuse
i
assume
to
appear
at
the
physical
examination,
that
it
warned
him
that
he
might
be
delinquent,
and
that
in
that
warning
stated
that
he
would
be
denied
various
rights
under
the
law
and
subject
to
induction.
and
shortly
thereafter,
it
declared
him
a
delinquent
and
notified
him
that
he
had
been
declared
a
delinquent
by
reason
of
his
failure
to
appear
for
the
physical
examination,
and
also
by
reason
of
his
failure
to
keep
the
board
informed
of
his
current
address.
as
we
set
forth
in
the
record
in
the
briefs,
many
of
these
notices
which
petitioner
was
charged
was
not
receiving
and
was
being
delinquent
on
the
basis
of
were
not
received
by
him
or
according,
there
was
no
record
that
they
where
ever
receive
by
him.
needless
to
say,
the
determination
that
he
committed
these
infractions
if
indeed,
he
committed
him
was
made
unilaterally
by
the
board.
there
was
no
hearing.
there
was
no
opportunity
for
any
presentation
of
witnesses.
there
was
no
opportunity
even
for
the
personal
appearance
and
appeal
which
is
normally
available
in
the
selective
service
classification
process.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
we
don’t
know
mr.
justice
powell
on
the
facts
and
the
record
show
that.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
justice
powell,
it
is
also
a
crime
to
violate
the
selective
service
regulation
that
requires
one
to
keep
the
selective
service
board
informed
of
current
address.
and
indeed,
there
are
many
prosecutions
for
that
offense,
just
as
there
are
many
prosecutions
with
failure
to
appear
with
the
physical.
but
petitioner
was
not
prosecuted
for
either
of
these
offenses.
rather,
he
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction
and
prosecuted
for
induction
refusal.
i
submit
that
if
this
court
said
in
gutknecht
that
congress
never
gave
the
president
or/and
never
authorize
him
to
give
to
the
selective
service
system
any
power
to
set
up
a
delinquency
scheme
for
priority
induction,
then
regardless
of
what
might
be
the
underlying
factual
situations
of
other
infractions
that
the
board
never
had
authority
to
send
them
an
induction
order.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
only
i
can
say
in
response
to
that
mr.
justice
powell
is
that
since
there
was
never
hearing,
since
there
was
never
any
due
process
determination,
indeed,
there
was
never
even
any
quasi
due
process
determination,
i
don’t
think
it’s
really
fair
to
speculate
that
he
avoided
the
draft
or
that
he
had
good
and
bona
fide
reasons
for
not
responding
to
those
notices,
because
no
finding
was
ever
made.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
oh,
i
presume
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
presume
illness.
i
presume
unavailability
because
of
some
other
legal
commitment
and
possibility
of
performance.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
presume
that
of
boards
often
--
boards
often
postponed
physicals
upon
the
request
of
the
registrant.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i’m
sorry.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
submit
that
this
is
not
the
brunt
of
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
try
to
as
best
i
can
your
honor.
in
any
event,
the
--
on
appeal
of
petitioner’s
conviction,
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
and
remanded
the
consider
in
the
light
of
gutknecht,
this
was
davis
one.
on
remand,
the
district
court
gave
the
same
narrow
interpretation
to
gutknecht
which
the
government
now
advances
and
which
since
been
disapproved
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
fox.
on
the
remand
hearing,
the
court
held
that
petitioner’s
induction
had
not
accelerated
in
fact,
based
largely
on
the
opinion
testimony
of
the
local
board
clerk
to
the
affect
that
petitioner
would
have
been
ordered
to
report
in
any
event
on
or
prior
to
the
date
of
his
order
to
report
as
delinquent.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
per
curiam
holding
that
there
was
no
acceleration
within
the
meaning
of
gutknecht.
certiorari
was
sought
based
on
the
tripartite
circuit
conflict
and
denied
by
this
court
after
the
court
had
been
informed
of
the
intervening
fox
decision.
a
petition
for
rehearing
out
of
time,
accompanied
by
a
full
brief
on
the
merits
was
presented
to
the
ninth
circuit
but
denied
without
opinion.
and
consequently,
this
2255
proceeding
was
started
and
denied
by
the
district
judge
without
opinion
and
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
davis
three.
i
respectfully
submit
that
a
change
in
the
law
occurred,
although
disputed
by
the
davis-three
panel
as
conceded
by
the
government
in
a
self-evident.
and
the
apparent
basis
for
denial
of
relief
by
the
court
below
on
some
notion
of
law
of
the
case
is
likewise
concededly
erroneous.
indeed,
the
government
does
not
deny
that
change
in
the
law
is
a
proper
subject
for
section
2255.
what
the
government
attempts
to
do
is
to
minimize
the
statements
by
this
court
in
sanders
and
kaufman
that
an
intervening
change
in
the
law
is
appropriate
subject
--
is
an
appropriate
subject
for
post-conviction
relief.
and
then
the
government
asked
some
rhetorical
questions
and
engages
in
some
handwringing
as
to
dire
effects
of
recognizing
the
change
in
the
law
based
on
non-binding
decisions
from
other
circuits,
but
that
indeed
is
a
red
herring
because
there’s
no
such
issue
before
this
court.
petitioner
seeks
only
the
benefit
of
the
law
of
the
circuit
which
has
jurisdiction
over
the
court
which
has
convicted
him.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
there
is
a
considerable
difference
and
it’s
precisely
the
point
that
i’m
about
to
address
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
it
is
our
view,
and
this
perhaps
is
the
fundamental
question
in
this
case,
though
it’s
very
hard
to
find
what’s
the
fundamental
question
that
the
government’s
argument
that
section
2255
relief
is
only
available
if
there
is
a
denial
of
a
fundamental
constitutional
right
and
that
there
was
no
such
denial
here,
totally
mis-characterizes
and
minimizes
the
holdings
in
gutknecht
and
in
fox.
in
fact
in
our
view,
gutknecht
is
a
constitutional
decision
of
the
first
magnitude
because
it
holds
that
selective
service
boards
are
without
power
to
promulgate
and
enforce
delinquency
regulations.
the
decision
in
gutknecht
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
because
they’re
not
authorized
by
--
because
neither
the
president
nor
the
selective
service
system
are
authorized
by
congress
to
do
so.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
your
honor.
and
if
that
is
so,
it
seems
to
me,
it
is
incredibly
myopic
or
worst
for
the
government
to
say
that
since
there
was
not
a
specific
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights
which
the
court
pointed
its
finger
at
in
gutknecht
that
it
can’t
be
considered
a
constitutional
holding.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
there
are
members
of
this
court
your
honor
and
distinct
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
your
honor?
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
my
position
is
that
it
does
not
make
any
difference.
my
position
is
that
even
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
your
honor.
the
first
position
is
that
gutknecht
is
a
constitutional
holding
and
i
advance
that
is
the
major
position.
but
even
that
gutknecht
to
seem
is
a
non
constitutional
holding,
we
have
of
course
first,
2255,
the
statute
itself
which
has
constitution
or
laws,
and
we
have
the
absence
of
any
decision
by
this
court
which
states
other
than
in
dicta
that
2255
is
only
available
in
the
constitutional
case.
and
then
i
respectfully
suggest,
we
have
a
perhaps
common
sense
argument
if
i
may
advance
it.
there
are
certain
types
of
rights
which
it
seems
to
me
that
even
though
they
have
not
been
in
ensconced
with
a
constitutional
category
by
this
court
are
so
fundamental
that
their
denial
would
have
to
be
the
basis
for
2255
relief,
and
take
for
example,
if
someone
is
denied
the
right
to
an
appeal.
now,
this
court
had
said
on
many
occasions
that
it
is
not
clear
whether
there
was
constitutional
right
to
an
appeal,
but
of
course,
there’s
a
statutory
right
to
an
appeal.
and
surely,
someone
who
through
some
mischance
was
denied
a
right
to
an
appeal
and
as
some
prisoner
sent
in
a
writ
three
years
after
he
had
been
denied
the
right
to
appeal
based
on
2255,
i
doubt
if
he
could
be
properly
be
denied
the
hearing
on
whether
he
was
improperly
denied
as
right
to
an
appeal
which
is
non-constitutional.
if
i
may
just
pursue
the
constitutional
point
one
minute
more.
the
government
says
that
there
is
no
reference
to
any
provision
of
the
constitution
in
the
gutknecht
case.
but
gutknecht
relies
on
kent
against
dulles,
and
kent
against
dulles
turn
cites
the
famous
youngstown
against
sawyer
case,
and
also
perhaps
even
more
famous
in
somewhat
older,
panama
refining
case.
and
both
of
these
cases
obviously
stand
for
the
proposition
that
where
there
is
an
absence
of
law,
where
there
is
an
absence
of
authority,
then
it
is
beyond
constitutional
power.
and
if
one
needs
to
put
one’s
finger
on
a
constitutional
clause,
i
respectfully
suggest
to
my
learned
brother
that
the
constitutional
clause
is
article
i,
section
1.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice,
you
recited
article
i,
section
1,
and
we
have
extracted
what
we
believe
is
a
fair
summary
and
quotation
from
that
opinion
in
a
reply
brief
which
we’ve
just
recently
filed
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but
i
think,
to
argue
that
gutknecht
is
not
a
constitutional
holding
is
to
argue
that
panama
refining
and
youngstown
are
not
constitutional
holdings,
and
i
submit
such
an
argument
is
absurd.
if
there’s
anymore
fundamental
argument
than
a
violation
of
the
constitution
because
of
the
violation
of
a
constitutional
provision,
it
is
acting
in
the
absence
of
constitutional
authority.
now,
of
course,
there
is
also
fifth
amendment
procedural
due
process
questions
which
the
government
at
various
points
in
its
briefs
seems
to
partially
concede.
now,
the
fact
that
gutknecht
and
fox
must
be
retroactively
applied,
i
respectfully
submit
is
another
reason
why
section
2255
relief
is
appropriate
here.
of
course,
the
retroactivity
argument
which
the
government
vigorously
argues
against
our
position
assumes
that
fox
is
correct,
otherwise,
we
wouldn’t
be
here
talking
about
retroactivity.
indeed,
we
wouldn’t
even
be
here
talking
about
2255.
now
of
course,
first,
fox
is
already
been
held
retroactive
by
the
very
circuit
which
decided
it.
second,
gutknecht
has
been
retroactively
applied
universally
and
we
cite
all
the
cases
on
page
46
of
our
brief,
i
would
particularly
and
respectfully
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
the
very
careful
analysis
of
retroactivity
of
gutknecht
by
chief
judges
of
that
in
united
states
against
kelly.
moreover,
there
is
no
need,
there
is
no
occasion
to
engage
in
the
pragmatic
linkletter/stovall
type
analysis
which
the
government
urges
upon
us,
because
this
is
not
a
case
which
seeks
to
determine
the
retroactivity
of
procedural
rules
which
bind
the
contact
--
which
govern
the
conduct
of
a
trial.
like
robinson
against
neil,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
points
out
in
the
opinion
for
the
court,
this
case
is
similar
to
a
valid
claim
of
double
jeopardy,
because
if
fox
is
correct,
then
there
will
not
be
any
fact-finding
burden,
and
there
will
not
be
any
further
trial.
there
would
be
no
question
of
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process
because
the
fact-finding
process
is
at
an
end.
finally,
the
ends
of
justice
will
be
served
by
granting
post-conviction
relief
and
we
are
reminded
in
kaufman
and
in
sanders
and
another
decisions
that
that
must
always
be
borne
in
mind.
i
first
may
say
that
the
problems
which
have
been
raised
by
justices
of
this
court
and
by
distinguished
scholars,
some
of
which
are
referred
to
in
mr.
justice
powell’s
concurring
opinion
in
schneckloth
against
bustamonte
are
not
simply,
not
available
in
this
case.
there
was
no
problem
here
of
any
deliberate
bypass
of
other
available
remedies.
petitioner
has
been
knocking
at
every
conceivable
judicial
gate
looking
for
a
remedy
these
past
years.
furthermore,
it’s
obviously
no
delicate
question
of
federal
state
relations,
and
as
i
stated
before
and
as
i
think
should
be
stressed
it
is
no
question
here
of
a
guilty
person
going
free
because
of
some
exclusionary
rule
or
some
similar
prophylactic
device.
if
fox
is
correct
and
mr.
justice
powell,
if
i
may
again
respond
to
your
prior
question,
the
ninth
circuit
in
fox
indicated
that
they
weren’t
very
happy
about
his
selective
services
to
(inaudible).
but
if
fox
is
correct,
then
the
induction
order
is
invalid
and
the
indictment
just
must
be
dismissed
because
the
crime
of
induction
refusal
has
just
not
been
committed.
now,
the
government
at
one
point
notes
the
various
scholarly
criticism
of
2255,
but
then
at
another
point
states
that
even
if
fox
is
right
and
even
if
this
is
a
meritorious
claim,
then
nevertheless
should
not
be
2255
relief
because
of
the
government’s
own
conception
of
how
narrow
it
should
be.
the
government
therefore
is
making
its
own
unique
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
may
it
please
the
court,
i
just
don’t
know
what
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
your
honor.
yes
and
i
don’t
believe
the
government
is
seriously
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
don’t
think
so,
but
there
is
--
as
we
note
in
our
reply
brief,
they
seem
to
sneak
it
in
somewhere
towards
the
end
of
their
brief
as
a
partial
reason.
but
i
think
that
the
government
is
making
its
own
unique
contribution
to
this
debate
on
the
scope
of
2255.
while
many
justices
and
scholars
are
arguing
that
it
should
be
construed
so
as
not
to
help
the
guilty,
the
government
now
argues
that
it
should
also
be
construed
so
as
not
to
help
the
innocent.
and
that
i
think
is
the
import
of
the
government
saying
that
2255
should
be
narrowed
even
beyond
that
suggested
in
the
various
critical
literature
which
i’ve
referred
to.
with
the
court’s
permission,
i’ll
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
it
may
come
as
a
surprise
to
the
government,
but
we
believe
that
this
issue
at
least
in
one
sense
has
been
before
this
court
before.
and
that
was
when
this
court
had
before
it,
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
against
peet
from
the
ninth
circuit
and
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
p-e-e-t,
mr.
justice
cited
in
our
brief
on
page
43.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
in
peet
on
the
basis
of
gutknecht,
the
conviction
was
vacated
and
remanded
for
re-sentencing
since
there
was
a
two-count
conviction
in
that
case,
and
peet
had
been
declared
delinquent
for
non-appearance
at
a
physical
examination.
but
of
course,
there
was
no
written
opinion,
but
a
vacation
of
a
judgment
of
a
court
of
appeals,
i
always
understood,
is
action
on
the
merits.
now,
it
is
our
basic
contention
that
there
are
three
species
of
delinquency
sanctions
which
were
created
in
the
delinquency
regulations.
and
that
each
and
all
of
them
are
equally
invalid
because
equally
without
congressional
authorization.
congress
did
not
authorize
delinquency
induction
without
a
physical
examination,
and
without
a
statement
of
acceptability,
anymore
than
it
authorized
punitive
reclassification
as
in
the
case
of
oestereich,
or
accelerated
induction
as
in
the
case
of
gutknecht.
the
offense
to
the
basic
constitutional
right
that
is
involved
is
not
so
much
the
facts
of
any
particular
case
or
the
nature
of
sanction,
but
the
offense
is
the
existence
of
this
delinquency
power
because
it
implies
an
extra
penal
sanction,
the
sanction
of
induction
under
extraordinary
conditions
for
asserted
wrongdoings.
now,
perhaps,
congress
has
this
power
under
the
constitution.
the
solicitor
general
speculates
at
note
17
of
his
brief
as
to
whether
congress
might
have
the
power
to
induct
draft
card
burnings.
but
the
fact
is
that
congress
has
not
sought
to
exercise
that
power,
to
either
give
it
to
the
president
or
to
the
selective
service
system.
and
i
submit
that
in
the
words
of
oestereich
and
gutknecht,
what
we
have
here
is
sheer
administrative
lawlessness,
blatantly
lawless
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
executive
authority
creating
this
power
and
bestowing
it
by
executive
order
to
the
administrative
agencies.
now,
insofar
as
prejudice
is
concerned,
the
petitioner
davis
was
prejudiced
because
he
was
inducted
without
this
congressional
authorization.
he’s
prejudice
was
as
great
as
someone
who
is
prejudiced
by
being
tried
and
convicted
before
a
judge
without
jurisdiction.
or
perhaps
more
to
the
point
for
an
act,
however,
it
might
be
considered
reprehensible
which
is
not
been
declared
a
crime.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
effect
of
gutknecht
is
as
in
united
states
against
united
states
claim
and
currency
is
to
declare
that
persons
who
have
failed
to
report
for
induction
following
the
declaration
of
delinquency
are
constitutionally
immune
from
punishment,
and
that
any
acts
which
they
may
have
committed
may
be
susceptible
to
other
kinds
of
criminal
enforcement,
but
not
susceptible
to
this
kind
of
criminal
enforcement
because
it
has
never
been
authorized
by
the
only
body
under
article
i,
section
1
which
has
the
power
to
authorized
punishment,
the
congress.
consequently,
i
don’t
think
that
there
is
any
point
to
getting
into
a
discussion
as
to
whether
davis
and
other
similarly
situated
are
prejudiced
by
not
having
the
21-day
statement
of
acceptability
and
the
time
to
seek
to
obtain
review
by
not
having
two
physical
examinations
rather
than
one,
and
by
not
having
all
of
the
rights
to
seek
additional
deferments
and
exemptions
which
as
this
court
knows
from
the
evett
case
are
automatically
cutoff
upon
the
issuance
of
an
induction
order.
now,
some
reference
has
have
been
made
to
new
section
1631.7
in
the
colloquy
between
mr.
justice
stewart
and
the
solicitor
general.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
new
section
1631.7
which
presumably
allows
induction
upon
a
finding
of
refusal
without
the
use
of
the
badge
word
delinquency
does
not
cure
the
problem
and
was
not
the
basis
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
fox.
we
would
respectfully
refer
to
the
court
the
opinion
of
chief
judge
cancio
in
united
states
against
castillo
in
the
district
of
puerto
rico
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
but
i
do
not
believe
the
decision
has
yet
been
reported.
and
judge
cancio
points
out
that
a
rose
is
a
rose
is
a
rose,
and
that
a
local
board
that
making
a
unilateral
due
process
less
determination
that
someone
refused
to
attend
the
physical
without
using
the
word
delinquency
is
just
as
much
offending
the
gutknecht
principle
as
a
local
board
that
does
it
with
the
utilization
of
the
badge
word
delinquency.
insofar
as
concern
zach
against
benson,
i
don’t
know
whether
the
ninth
circuit
was
aware
or
was
not
aware
of
what
the
solicitor
general
thinks
that
should
have
been
aware,
but
i
do
know
what
was
said
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
briefs
which
will
presented
before
it.
and
the
first
line
of
the
argument
points
out
that
this
is
a
section
2255
case,
and
the
ninth
circuit
is
fully
aware
of
the
fact
in
zach
against
benson,
the
brief
of
which
i
just
read
from
that
it
was
2255
case
and
that
was
before
it.
of
course,
it
does
not
preclude
this
court,
but
it
certainly
shows
that
view
taken
by
the
one
panel
in
the
ninth
circuit
which
has
ruled
on
it.
finally,
the
government
speaks
of
the
purposes
of
deterrence
and
rehabilitation
of
section
2255.
the
purposes
of
the
deterrence
it
seems
to
me
are
completely
satisfied
by
the
existence
of
the
alternative
sanction,
of
prosecution
and
conviction
for
failure
to
report
for
a
physical
examination
which
carries
the
same
five-year,
$10,000.00
maximum
penalty
as
refusal
of
induction.
and
insofar
as
concerns
the
purpose
of
rehabilitation,
i
wonder
what
rehabilitative
purpose
is
served
by
allowing
two
men
in
exactly
the
same
situation
to
be
in
the
status
of
one
being
free
and
the
other
being
under
criminal
conviction
and
possibly
in
jail.
thank
you.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
for
review
of
the
ninth
circuit’s
denial
of
post
conviction
relief
under
28
u.s.c.
section
2255
to
petitioner
joseph
anthony
davis,
who
was
convicted
of
refusal
of
induction
into
the
armed
services.
it
is
conceded
that
he
was
ordered
to
report
as
a
delinquent
without
a
prior
physical
examination,
and
a
statement
of
acceptability
as
the
selective
service
regulations
required
for
all
persons
not
delinquents.
it
is
likewise
conceded
that
he
was
declared
delinquent
by
his
local
board
because
it
unilaterally
determined
that
he
did
not
comply
with
the
prior
order
to
report
for
a
physical
examination.
and
it
is
also
conceded
that,
but
for
his
delinquency
status,
he
could
not
have
been
ordered
to
report
for
induction
without
the
prior
pre-induction
physical
examination,
and
the
statement
of
acceptability
issued
at
least
21
days
before
the
induction
date.
his
conviction
was
affirmed
by
the
ninth
circuit
not
withstanding
and
argument
made
on
direct
appeal
that
his
delinquency
induction
order
was
invalid
under
the
doctrine
established
by
this
court
in
gutknecht
against
united
states.
while
petitioner’s
case
was
pending
before
this
court
on
certiorari,
a
change
in
the
law
occurred.
the
ninth
circuit
decided
united
states
against
fox,
a
case
concededly
identical
to
that
of
davis,
holding
what
the
gutknecht
doctrine
required
the
invalidation
of
delinquency
based
induction
orders
when
the
order
to
report
without
a
prior
physical
examination
and
statement
of
acceptability
was
based
upon
a
declaration
of
delinquency.
post
conviction
relief
was
sought
on
the
basis
of
this
intervening
fox
decision
and
denied
by
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit.
thus,
there
are
two
principle
questions,
may
it
please
the
court
in
this
case.
the
first
is
whether
post
conviction
relief
under
2255
is
available
when
there
has
been
an
intervening
change
in
the
law
to
the
2255
petitioner’s
benefit
and
a
case
concededly
identical
to
petitioner’s
case
on
the
facts
and
on
the
law
which
was
decided
after
appellate
affirmance
of
petitioner’s
conviction
and
while
a
prior
petition
for
certiorari
was
pending.
based
on,
i
respectfully
submit
some
unexplained
and
inexplicable
motion
of
law
of
the
case
which
is
totally
erroneous,
the
ninth
circuit
held
per
curiam
that
there
was
no
basis
for
2255
relief
because
petitioner’s
claim
had
been
advanced
albeit
unsuccessfully
in
the
absence
of
the
new
law
on
direct
appeal.
indeed,
the
change
in
the
law
occurred
four
months
after
the
direct
appeal.
the
government
has
apparently
confessed
error,
either
in
whole
or
in
part
on
this
point,
but
our
view
is
against
post
conviction
relief
for
other
reasons
which
we
respectfully
submit
are
equally
without
merit.
the
second
question,
of
course
and
perhaps
the
fundamental
question
is
whether
the
intervening
new
law
decision
in
united
states
against
fox
which
invalidated
a
species
of
delinquency
sanction
which
was
not
before
this
court
in
gutknecht,
the
sanction
of
induction
without
a
prior
pre
induction
physical
examination,
and
the
statement
of
acceptability
was
a
proper
interpretation
by
the
fox
court
of
this
court’s
decision
in
gutknecht
and
also
this
court’s
decision
in
oestereich.
gutknecht
and
oestereich
as
would
be
recalled
of
course
invalidated
somewhat
more
dramatic
species
of
delinquency
sanctions
than
that
involved
in
this
case.
now,
the
government
admits
that
davis,
this
case,
and
fox
are
utterly
inconsistent
which
the
ninth
circuit
again
astonishingly
refused
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
is
certainly
a
possible
solution
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
respectfully
suggest
that
since
that
if
fox
is
the
law
and
if
fox
is
correct,
that
a
remand
would
be
an
unnecessary
waste
of
judicial
time
on
the
part
of
the
ninth
circuit,
and
perhaps
i
even
fear
to
think
on
the
part
of
this
court,
because
this
case
has
been
in
the
ninth
circuit
on
three
occasions
and
these
very
arguments
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
ninth
circuit.
and
when
we
were
previously
here
on
certiorari,
indeed,
we
suggested
that
this
court
might
wish
to
remand
to
the
ninth
court
with
the
suggestion
for
reconsideration.
but
thus
far,
nothing
is
available.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
your
honor,
we
cite
in
our
brief
the
one
or
two
ninth
circuit
decisions
which
cite
and
follow
fox
and
we
find
no
others
and
none
depart
from
it.
if
i
may
represent
to
the
court
as
a
member
of
the
bar
of
the
ninth
circuit,
i
have
been
informed
by
united
states
attorneys
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
it
is
the
uniform
prosecutorial
practice
to
act
as
the
fox
is
law.
indeed,
the
united
states
attorney
told
me
that
fox
is
considered
the
son
of
gutknecht.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes
your
honor,
yes
your
honor
which
of
course
is
the
very
gist
of
the
constitutional
defect
in
the
prosecution
here.
the
man
was
prosecuted
for
a
crime
of
which
he
did
not
have
constitutionally
committed
under
this
court’s
decision
in
the
gutknecht
case.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
it
is
hard
to
gleam
that
from
the
ninth
circuit’s
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
ninth
circuit
to
the
extent
that
it
said
anything
in
the
brief
opinion
which
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix
said
that
they
do
not
agree
that
fox
changed
the
law,
and
it
also
made
the
species
i
respectfully
suggest
of
the
case
argument.
but
of
course,
the
day
after
fox
or
the
same
day
as
fox,
another
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
case
of
zack
against
benson
applied
fox
obviously
retroactively
since
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes
your
honor,
and
in
our
reply
brief,
we
recite
the
statement
of
facts
from
zack
against
benson
which
makes
this
clear
and
i
am
sure
the
government
won’t
contest
it.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
your
honor,
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
batiste
case
presaged
fox,
presaged
the
ninth
circuit
and
announced
the
same
kind
of
per
se
decision,
reasoning
from
this
court’s
decision
in
gutknecht
that
even
though
it
might
be
interesting
to
speculate
on
whether
or
not
there
was
acceleration
in
fact,
we
believe
that
gutknecht
requires
us
to
hold
that
any
delinquency
based
induction
order
is
per
se
invalid,
that
is
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
batiste.
the
government
views
the
decision
somewhat
differently,
but
i’m
sure
your
honors
can
read
it.
the
fourth
circuit
in
dobie
took
a
somewhat
different
view.
the
fourth
circuit
in
dobie
stated
that
where
there
is
delinquency
based
induction
order,
there
is
a
heavy
burden
of
proof
upon
the
government
to
show
that
there
was
not
acceleration
in
fact.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes.
and
the
fourth
circuit
in
dobie
in
a
very
careful
decision
by
judge
butzner
pointed
out
the
only
proper
standards
which
can
be
used
to
overcome
this
heavy
burden
of
proof.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
an
alternative
ground
on
which
the
decision
below
must
be
reversed,
but
we
would
hope
that
it
would
be
reversed
on
fox
and
batiste
grounds
rather
than
on
dobie
grounds.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
no
your
honor.
there
are
various
decisions
of
district
courts,
but
i’m
not
aware
of
any
other
circuit
dealing
with
it.
of
course,
the
underlying
question
by
the
--
presented
by
this
case
is
the
scope
and
the
legal
significance
of
the
constitutional
holding
of
this
court
in
gutknecht.
i
believe
that
it
is
apparent
from
the
reading
of
the
gutknecht
decision
that
the
essential
holding
is
that
congress
never
vested
the
authority
to
induct
as
delinquents
in
either
the
president
or
the
selective
service
system,
and
that
any
such
standard
was
delegation
would
be
unconstitutional.
now,
as
i
noted
before,
the
case
has
been
to
the
ninth
circuit
three
times
into
this
court
twice,
consequently,
it
has
a
somewhat
elongated
history
which
we
try
to
set
forth
and
explicate
in
our
briefs.
but
the
essence,
the
essential
facts
which
provided
the
basic
legal
posture
of
the
case
is
that
the
local
board
in
the
effect
accused
petitioner
of
failing
without
reasonable
excuse
i
assume
to
appear
at
the
physical
examination,
that
it
warned
him
that
he
might
be
delinquent,
and
that
in
that
warning
stated
that
he
would
be
denied
various
rights
under
the
law
and
subject
to
induction.
and
shortly
thereafter,
it
declared
him
a
delinquent
and
notified
him
that
he
had
been
declared
a
delinquent
by
reason
of
his
failure
to
appear
for
the
physical
examination,
and
also
by
reason
of
his
failure
to
keep
the
board
informed
of
his
current
address.
as
we
set
forth
in
the
record
in
the
briefs,
many
of
these
notices
which
petitioner
was
charged
was
not
receiving
and
was
being
delinquent
on
the
basis
of
were
not
received
by
him
or
according,
there
was
no
record
that
they
where
ever
receive
by
him.
needless
to
say,
the
determination
that
he
committed
these
infractions
if
indeed,
he
committed
him
was
made
unilaterally
by
the
board.
there
was
no
hearing.
there
was
no
opportunity
for
any
presentation
of
witnesses.
there
was
no
opportunity
even
for
the
personal
appearance
and
appeal
which
is
normally
available
in
the
selective
service
classification
process.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
we
don’t
know
mr.
justice
powell
on
the
facts
and
the
record
show
that.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
justice
powell,
it
is
also
a
crime
to
violate
the
selective
service
regulation
that
requires
one
to
keep
the
selective
service
board
informed
of
current
address.
and
indeed,
there
are
many
prosecutions
for
that
offense,
just
as
there
are
many
prosecutions
with
failure
to
appear
with
the
physical.
but
petitioner
was
not
prosecuted
for
either
of
these
offenses.
rather,
he
was
ordered
to
report
for
induction
and
prosecuted
for
induction
refusal.
i
submit
that
if
this
court
said
in
gutknecht
that
congress
never
gave
the
president
or/and
never
authorize
him
to
give
to
the
selective
service
system
any
power
to
set
up
a
delinquency
scheme
for
priority
induction,
then
regardless
of
what
might
be
the
underlying
factual
situations
of
other
infractions
that
the
board
never
had
authority
to
send
them
an
induction
order.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
the
only
i
can
say
in
response
to
that
mr.
justice
powell
is
that
since
there
was
never
hearing,
since
there
was
never
any
due
process
determination,
indeed,
there
was
never
even
any
quasi
due
process
determination,
i
don’t
think
it’s
really
fair
to
speculate
that
he
avoided
the
draft
or
that
he
had
good
and
bona
fide
reasons
for
not
responding
to
those
notices,
because
no
finding
was
ever
made.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
oh,
i
presume
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
presume
illness.
i
presume
unavailability
because
of
some
other
legal
commitment
and
possibility
of
performance.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
well,
i
presume
that
of
boards
often
--
boards
often
postponed
physicals
upon
the
request
of
the
registrant.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i’m
sorry.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
no,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
submit
that
this
is
not
the
brunt
of
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
try
to
as
best
i
can
your
honor.
in
any
event,
the
--
on
appeal
of
petitioner’s
conviction,
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
and
remanded
the
consider
in
the
light
of
gutknecht,
this
was
davis
one.
on
remand,
the
district
court
gave
the
same
narrow
interpretation
to
gutknecht
which
the
government
now
advances
and
which
since
been
disapproved
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
fox.
on
the
remand
hearing,
the
court
held
that
petitioner’s
induction
had
not
accelerated
in
fact,
based
largely
on
the
opinion
testimony
of
the
local
board
clerk
to
the
affect
that
petitioner
would
have
been
ordered
to
report
in
any
event
on
or
prior
to
the
date
of
his
order
to
report
as
delinquent.
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
per
curiam
holding
that
there
was
no
acceleration
within
the
meaning
of
gutknecht.
certiorari
was
sought
based
on
the
tripartite
circuit
conflict
and
denied
by
this
court
after
the
court
had
been
informed
of
the
intervening
fox
decision.
a
petition
for
rehearing
out
of
time,
accompanied
by
a
full
brief
on
the
merits
was
presented
to
the
ninth
circuit
but
denied
without
opinion.
and
consequently,
this
2255
proceeding
was
started
and
denied
by
the
district
judge
without
opinion
and
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
davis
three.
i
respectfully
submit
that
a
change
in
the
law
occurred,
although
disputed
by
the
davis-three
panel
as
conceded
by
the
government
in
a
self-evident.
and
the
apparent
basis
for
denial
of
relief
by
the
court
below
on
some
notion
of
law
of
the
case
is
likewise
concededly
erroneous.
indeed,
the
government
does
not
deny
that
change
in
the
law
is
a
proper
subject
for
section
2255.
what
the
government
attempts
to
do
is
to
minimize
the
statements
by
this
court
in
sanders
and
kaufman
that
an
intervening
change
in
the
law
is
appropriate
subject
--
is
an
appropriate
subject
for
post-conviction
relief.
and
then
the
government
asked
some
rhetorical
questions
and
engages
in
some
handwringing
as
to
dire
effects
of
recognizing
the
change
in
the
law
based
on
non-binding
decisions
from
other
circuits,
but
that
indeed
is
a
red
herring
because
there’s
no
such
issue
before
this
court.
petitioner
seeks
only
the
benefit
of
the
law
of
the
circuit
which
has
jurisdiction
over
the
court
which
has
convicted
him.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
there
is
a
considerable
difference
and
it’s
precisely
the
point
that
i’m
about
to
address
mr.
justice
stewart.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
it
is
our
view,
and
this
perhaps
is
the
fundamental
question
in
this
case,
though
it’s
very
hard
to
find
what’s
the
fundamental
question
that
the
government’s
argument
that
section
2255
relief
is
only
available
if
there
is
a
denial
of
a
fundamental
constitutional
right
and
that
there
was
no
such
denial
here,
totally
mis-characterizes
and
minimizes
the
holdings
in
gutknecht
and
in
fox.
in
fact
in
our
view,
gutknecht
is
a
constitutional
decision
of
the
first
magnitude
because
it
holds
that
selective
service
boards
are
without
power
to
promulgate
and
enforce
delinquency
regulations.
the
decision
in
gutknecht
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
because
they’re
not
authorized
by
--
because
neither
the
president
nor
the
selective
service
system
are
authorized
by
congress
to
do
so.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
your
honor.
and
if
that
is
so,
it
seems
to
me,
it
is
incredibly
myopic
or
worst
for
the
government
to
say
that
since
there
was
not
a
specific
provision
of
the
bill
of
rights
which
the
court
pointed
its
finger
at
in
gutknecht
that
it
can’t
be
considered
a
constitutional
holding.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
there
are
members
of
this
court
your
honor
and
distinct
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
your
honor?
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
my
position
is
that
it
does
not
make
any
difference.
my
position
is
that
even
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
your
honor.
the
first
position
is
that
gutknecht
is
a
constitutional
holding
and
i
advance
that
is
the
major
position.
but
even
that
gutknecht
to
seem
is
a
non
constitutional
holding,
we
have
of
course
first,
2255,
the
statute
itself
which
has
constitution
or
laws,
and
we
have
the
absence
of
any
decision
by
this
court
which
states
other
than
in
dicta
that
2255
is
only
available
in
the
constitutional
case.
and
then
i
respectfully
suggest,
we
have
a
perhaps
common
sense
argument
if
i
may
advance
it.
there
are
certain
types
of
rights
which
it
seems
to
me
that
even
though
they
have
not
been
in
ensconced
with
a
constitutional
category
by
this
court
are
so
fundamental
that
their
denial
would
have
to
be
the
basis
for
2255
relief,
and
take
for
example,
if
someone
is
denied
the
right
to
an
appeal.
now,
this
court
had
said
on
many
occasions
that
it
is
not
clear
whether
there
was
constitutional
right
to
an
appeal,
but
of
course,
there’s
a
statutory
right
to
an
appeal.
and
surely,
someone
who
through
some
mischance
was
denied
a
right
to
an
appeal
and
as
some
prisoner
sent
in
a
writ
three
years
after
he
had
been
denied
the
right
to
appeal
based
on
2255,
i
doubt
if
he
could
be
properly
be
denied
the
hearing
on
whether
he
was
improperly
denied
as
right
to
an
appeal
which
is
non-constitutional.
if
i
may
just
pursue
the
constitutional
point
one
minute
more.
the
government
says
that
there
is
no
reference
to
any
provision
of
the
constitution
in
the
gutknecht
case.
but
gutknecht
relies
on
kent
against
dulles,
and
kent
against
dulles
turn
cites
the
famous
youngstown
against
sawyer
case,
and
also
perhaps
even
more
famous
in
somewhat
older,
panama
refining
case.
and
both
of
these
cases
obviously
stand
for
the
proposition
that
where
there
is
an
absence
of
law,
where
there
is
an
absence
of
authority,
then
it
is
beyond
constitutional
power.
and
if
one
needs
to
put
one’s
finger
on
a
constitutional
clause,
i
respectfully
suggest
to
my
learned
brother
that
the
constitutional
clause
is
article
i,
section
1.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
mr.
chief
justice,
you
recited
article
i,
section
1,
and
we
have
extracted
what
we
believe
is
a
fair
summary
and
quotation
from
that
opinion
in
a
reply
brief
which
we’ve
just
recently
filed
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
but
i
think,
to
argue
that
gutknecht
is
not
a
constitutional
holding
is
to
argue
that
panama
refining
and
youngstown
are
not
constitutional
holdings,
and
i
submit
such
an
argument
is
absurd.
if
there’s
anymore
fundamental
argument
than
a
violation
of
the
constitution
because
of
the
violation
of
a
constitutional
provision,
it
is
acting
in
the
absence
of
constitutional
authority.
now,
of
course,
there
is
also
fifth
amendment
procedural
due
process
questions
which
the
government
at
various
points
in
its
briefs
seems
to
partially
concede.
now,
the
fact
that
gutknecht
and
fox
must
be
retroactively
applied,
i
respectfully
submit
is
another
reason
why
section
2255
relief
is
appropriate
here.
of
course,
the
retroactivity
argument
which
the
government
vigorously
argues
against
our
position
assumes
that
fox
is
correct,
otherwise,
we
wouldn’t
be
here
talking
about
retroactivity.
indeed,
we
wouldn’t
even
be
here
talking
about
2255.
now
of
course,
first,
fox
is
already
been
held
retroactive
by
the
very
circuit
which
decided
it.
second,
gutknecht
has
been
retroactively
applied
universally
and
we
cite
all
the
cases
on
page
46
of
our
brief,
i
would
particularly
and
respectfully
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
the
very
careful
analysis
of
retroactivity
of
gutknecht
by
chief
judges
of
that
in
united
states
against
kelly.
moreover,
there
is
no
need,
there
is
no
occasion
to
engage
in
the
pragmatic
linkletter/stovall
type
analysis
which
the
government
urges
upon
us,
because
this
is
not
a
case
which
seeks
to
determine
the
retroactivity
of
procedural
rules
which
bind
the
contact
--
which
govern
the
conduct
of
a
trial.
like
robinson
against
neil,
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
points
out
in
the
opinion
for
the
court,
this
case
is
similar
to
a
valid
claim
of
double
jeopardy,
because
if
fox
is
correct,
then
there
will
not
be
any
fact-finding
burden,
and
there
will
not
be
any
further
trial.
there
would
be
no
question
of
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process
because
the
fact-finding
process
is
at
an
end.
finally,
the
ends
of
justice
will
be
served
by
granting
post-conviction
relief
and
we
are
reminded
in
kaufman
and
in
sanders
and
another
decisions
that
that
must
always
be
borne
in
mind.
i
first
may
say
that
the
problems
which
have
been
raised
by
justices
of
this
court
and
by
distinguished
scholars,
some
of
which
are
referred
to
in
mr.
justice
powell’s
concurring
opinion
in
schneckloth
against
bustamonte
are
not
simply,
not
available
in
this
case.
there
was
no
problem
here
of
any
deliberate
bypass
of
other
available
remedies.
petitioner
has
been
knocking
at
every
conceivable
judicial
gate
looking
for
a
remedy
these
past
years.
furthermore,
it’s
obviously
no
delicate
question
of
federal
state
relations,
and
as
i
stated
before
and
as
i
think
should
be
stressed
it
is
no
question
here
of
a
guilty
person
going
free
because
of
some
exclusionary
rule
or
some
similar
prophylactic
device.
if
fox
is
correct
and
mr.
justice
powell,
if
i
may
again
respond
to
your
prior
question,
the
ninth
circuit
in
fox
indicated
that
they
weren’t
very
happy
about
his
selective
services
to
(inaudible).
but
if
fox
is
correct,
then
the
induction
order
is
invalid
and
the
indictment
just
must
be
dismissed
because
the
crime
of
induction
refusal
has
just
not
been
committed.
now,
the
government
at
one
point
notes
the
various
scholarly
criticism
of
2255,
but
then
at
another
point
states
that
even
if
fox
is
right
and
even
if
this
is
a
meritorious
claim,
then
nevertheless
should
not
be
2255
relief
because
of
the
government’s
own
conception
of
how
narrow
it
should
be.
the
government
therefore
is
making
its
own
unique
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
may
it
please
the
court,
i
just
don’t
know
what
the
court
of
appeals
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
yes,
your
honor.
yes
and
i
don’t
believe
the
government
is
seriously
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
i
don’t
think
so,
but
there
is
--
as
we
note
in
our
reply
brief,
they
seem
to
sneak
it
in
somewhere
towards
the
end
of
their
brief
as
a
partial
reason.
but
i
think
that
the
government
is
making
its
own
unique
contribution
to
this
debate
on
the
scope
of
2255.
while
many
justices
and
scholars
are
arguing
that
it
should
be
construed
so
as
not
to
help
the
guilty,
the
government
now
argues
that
it
should
also
be
construed
so
as
not
to
help
the
innocent.
and
that
i
think
is
the
import
of
the
government
saying
that
2255
should
be
narrowed
even
beyond
that
suggested
in
the
various
critical
literature
which
i’ve
referred
to.
with
the
court’s
permission,
i’ll
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
it
may
come
as
a
surprise
to
the
government,
but
we
believe
that
this
issue
at
least
in
one
sense
has
been
before
this
court
before.
and
that
was
when
this
court
had
before
it,
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
the
case
of
the
united
states
against
peet
from
the
ninth
circuit
and
--
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
p-e-e-t,
mr.
justice
cited
in
our
brief
on
page
43.
mr.
marvin
m.
karpatkin
that
in
peet
on
the
basis
of
gutknecht,
the
conviction
was
vacated
and
remanded
for
re-sentencing
since
there
was
a
two-count
conviction
in
that
case,
and
peet
had
been
declared
delinquent
for
non-appearance
at
a
physical
examination.
but
of
course,
there
was
no
written
opinion,
but
a
vacation
of
a
judgment
of
a
court
of
appeals,
i
always
understood,
is
action
on
the
merits.
now,
it
is
our
basic
contention
that
there
are
three
species
of
delinquency
sanctions
which
were
created
in
the
delinquency
regulations.
and
that
each
and
all
of
them
are
equally
invalid
because
equally
without
congressional
authorization.
congress
did
not
authorize
delinquency
induction
without
a
physical
examination,
and
without
a
statement
of
acceptability,
anymore
than
it
authorized
punitive
reclassification
as
in
the
case
of
oestereich,
or
accelerated
induction
as
in
the
case
of
gutknecht.
the
offense
to
the
basic
constitutional
right
that
is
involved
is
not
so
much
the
facts
of
any
particular
case
or
the
nature
of
sanction,
but
the
offense
is
the
existence
of
this
delinquency
power
because
it
implies
an
extra
penal
sanction,
the
sanction
of
induction
under
extraordinary
conditions
for
asserted
wrongdoings.
now,
perhaps,
congress
has
this
power
under
the
constitution.
the
solicitor
general
speculates
at
note
17
of
his
brief
as
to
whether
congress
might
have
the
power
to
induct
draft
card
burnings.
but
the
fact
is
that
congress
has
not
sought
to
exercise
that
power,
to
either
give
it
to
the
president
or
to
the
selective
service
system.
and
i
submit
that
in
the
words
of
oestereich
and
gutknecht,
what
we
have
here
is
sheer
administrative
lawlessness,
blatantly
lawless
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
executive
authority
creating
this
power
and
bestowing
it
by
executive
order
to
the
administrative
agencies.
now,
insofar
as
prejudice
is
concerned,
the
petitioner
davis
was
prejudiced
because
he
was
inducted
without
this
congressional
authorization.
he’s
prejudice
was
as
great
as
someone
who
is
prejudiced
by
being
tried
and
convicted
before
a
judge
without
jurisdiction.
or
perhaps
more
to
the
point
for
an
act,
however,
it
might
be
considered
reprehensible
which
is
not
been
declared
a
crime.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
effect
of
gutknecht
is
as
in
united
states
against
united
states
claim
and
currency
is
to
declare
that
persons
who
have
failed
to
report
for
induction
following
the
declaration
of
delinquency
are
constitutionally
immune
from
punishment,
and
that
any
acts
which
they
may
have
committed
may
be
susceptible
to
other
kinds
of
criminal
enforcement,
but
not
susceptible
to
this
kind
of
criminal
enforcement
because
it
has
never
been
authorized
by
the
only
body
under
article
i,
section
1
which
has
the
power
to
authorized
punishment,
the
congress.
consequently,
i
don’t
think
that
there
is
any
point
to
getting
into
a
discussion
as
to
whether
davis
and
other
similarly
situated
are
prejudiced
by
not
having
the
21-day
statement
of
acceptability
and
the
time
to
seek
to
obtain
review
by
not
having
two
physical
examinations
rather
than
one,
and
by
not
having
all
of
the
rights
to
seek
additional
deferments
and
exemptions
which
as
this
court
knows
from
the
evett
case
are
automatically
cutoff
upon
the
issuance
of
an
induction
order.
now,
some
reference
has
have
been
made
to
new
section
1631.7
in
the
colloquy
between
mr.
justice
stewart
and
the
solicitor
general.
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
new
section
1631.7
which
presumably
allows
induction
upon
a
finding
of
refusal
without
the
use
of
the
badge
word
delinquency
does
not
cure
the
problem
and
was
not
the
basis
of
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
fox.
we
would
respectfully
refer
to
the
court
the
opinion
of
chief
judge
cancio
in
united
states
against
castillo
in
the
district
of
puerto
rico
which
is
cited
in
our
brief,
but
i
do
not
believe
the
decision
has
yet
been
reported.
and
judge
cancio
points
out
that
a
rose
is
a
rose
is
a
rose,
and
that
a
local
board
that
making
a
unilateral
due
process
less
determination
that
someone
refused
to
attend
the
physical
without
using
the
word
delinquency
is
just
as
much
offending
the
gutknecht
principle
as
a
local
board
that
does
it
with
the
utilization
of
the
badge
word
delinquency.
insofar
as
concern
zach
against
benson,
i
don’t
know
whether
the
ninth
circuit
was
aware
or
was
not
aware
of
what
the
solicitor
general
thinks
that
should
have
been
aware,
but
i
do
know
what
was
said
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
briefs
which
will
presented
before
it.
and
the
first
line
of
the
argument
points
out
that
this
is
a
section
2255
case,
and
the
ninth
circuit
is
fully
aware
of
the
fact
in
zach
against
benson,
the
brief
of
which
i
just
read
from
that
it
was
2255
case
and
that
was
before
it.
of
course,
it
does
not
preclude
this
court,
but
it
certainly
shows
that
view
taken
by
the
one
panel
in
the
ninth
circuit
which
has
ruled
on
it.
finally,
the
government
speaks
of
the
purposes
of
deterrence
and
rehabilitation
of
section
2255.
the
purposes
of
the
deterrence
it
seems
to
me
are
completely
satisfied
by
the
existence
of
the
alternative
sanction,
of
prosecution
and
conviction
for
failure
to
report
for
a
physical
examination
which
carries
the
same
five-year,
$10,000.00
maximum
penalty
as
refusal
of
induction.
and
insofar
as
concerns
the
purpose
of
rehabilitation,
i
wonder
what
rehabilitative
purpose
is
served
by
allowing
two
men
in
exactly
the
same
situation
to
be
in
the
status
of
one
being
free
and
the
other
being
under
criminal
conviction
and
possibly
in
jail.
thank
you.
