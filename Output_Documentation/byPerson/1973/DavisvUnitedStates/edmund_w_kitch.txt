mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
in
this
case
has
three
independently
sufficient
reasons
that
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
below
should
be
affirmed.
it
is
a
rhetorical
difficulty
with
our
posture
that
in
order
to
argue
any
one
point,
we
must
for
purposes
of
argument
concede
the
validity
of
petitioner’s
position
on
the
other
two
points,
and
then
my
brother
has
been
able
to
find
a
cumulatively,
we
concede
our
entire
case.
our
three
points
are
that
the
subject
matter
of
this
claim
is
not
cognizable
under
section
2255
proceeding,
brought
and
after
the
judgment
of
conviction
has
become
final.
that
in
any
event,
the
conviction
of
the
district
court
was
proper
and
that
if
it
was
not
proper
and
the
rule
of
united
states
against
fox
is
correct,
that
rule
should
not
be
applied
retroactively.
in
our
brief,
we
argue
the
merits
of
the
conviction
first
for
purposes
of
exposition,
however,
logically,
this
court
must
reach
the
jurisdictional
issue
under
2255
before
it
would
reach
the
merits
and
therefore
i
will
address
the
2255
question
first.
this
is
a
question
of
considerable
importance
on
which
even
a
casual
reading
of
the
many
court
of
appeals
opinion
dealing
with
2255
will
reveal
a
need
for
this
court’s
attention.
for
instance,
zack
against
benson
in
the
ninth
circuit
on
which
petitioner
relies
as
a
holding
on
all
points
of
the
court
with
his
position.
in
that
case,
the
ninth
circuit
was
not
aware
that
there
was
a
2255
issue
to
be
addressed
before
relief
should
be
automatically
granted.
i
have
discussed
our
position
in
this
case
with
a
number
of
members
of
the
bar
of
some
experienced
who
--
although
finding
our
position
persuasive,
have
expressed
some
surprise
in
saying
that
although
they
hadn’t
really
thought
about
it,
they
always
understood
that
the
federal
system
was
a
double
trial,
double
appeal
system.
you
went
in
first,
your
conviction
an
appeal,
and
then
you
had
a
second
bite
at
the
apple.
now
as
i
think,
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
and
on
the
basis
of
the
authorities
in
our
brief,
it’s
clear
the
2255
plays
a
very
narrow
role
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
the
reasons,
the
policy
reasons
for
this
narrow
scope
of
collateral
attack
after
a
criminal
judgment
becomes
final
are
i
think
important
ones
in
bear
repetition
here.
first
of
all
is
the
importance
of
finality
for
the
function
of
a
criminal
law
itself,
the
functions
of
rehabilitation
and
deterrence.
a
criminal
law
cannot
rehabilitate
if
the
convicted
defender
is
constantly
faced
with
the
uncertainty
about
whether
he’s
conviction
is
really
valid
and
whether
if
he
just
didn’t
raise
one
more
claim,
he
would
in
fact
discover
that
he
had
been
wrongly
and
unjustly
convicted.
also,
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
these
are
general
policy
reasons
why
2255
is
narrowly
available.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
no
sir.
i
think
our
opinion
--
our
position
in
this
case
is
sustainable
under
the
all
of
the
views
of
habeas
corpus
which
had
been
advanced
the
opinions
of
this
court.
your
opinion
in
fay
against
noia
or
the
dissenting
opinion
in
schneckloth.
your
opinion
in
fay
against
noia
assumes
that
where
--
in
habeas
corpus,
we’re
talking
about
allegations
of
denial
of
fundamental
constitutional
rights
which
go
to
the
very
heart
of
the
process
of
justice
itself.
and
that’s
not
the
kind
of
issue
and
claim
which
petitioner
makes
in
this
case
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
oh,
i
must
--
i
misunderstood.
we
certainly
--
there
are
different
kinds
of
issues
which
already
have
historically
and
under
the
opinions
of
this
court
been
treated
different
under
2255.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
no,
your
honor.
the
section
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
the
section
reads
a
prisoner
in
custody
under
sentence
of
a
court,
claiming
the
right
to
be
released
upon
the
ground
of
the
sentence
was
imposed
in
violation
of
the
constitution
or
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
the
habeas
statute
has
comparable
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that’s
correct,
and
not
a
sentence
of
a
court
which
is
imposed
after
error
in
the
trial.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
no,
the
sentence
itself
is
not
illegal.
this
is
collateral
attack
that
goes
to
the
legality
of
the
sentence,
and
the
modern
habeas
corpus
practice
which
this
court
has
developed
has
said
that
certain
errors
or
such
a
fundamental
nature
that
effect
the
very
legality
of
the
sentence
itself.
but
not
every
error
is
an
error
which
affects
the
legality
of
a
sentence.
this
court’s
own
policy
on
finality
in
criminal
judgments
has
said
and
i
don’t
mean
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
adopted
by
this
court.
rule
33
is
the
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
sent
to
the
congress
by
this
court
after
this
court
approved
them.
rule
33
provides
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
well,
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
the
congress
has
ceded
in
the
rules
as
transmitted
by
the
court
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
--
and
the
rules
provide
in
rule
33,
in
the
motion
for
new
trial
which
is
the
great
traditional
method
for
correction
of
errors
after
judgment
in
the
trial
court
that
errors
or
in
allegations
the
discovery
of
new
evidence
when
relief
is
sought
under
rule
33,
release
should
be
sought
within
two
years,
and
that
as
to
all
other
errors,
relief
should
be
sought
within
seven
days.
now,
i
think
that
the
policy
reflected
rule
33
which
is
subject
can
be
revised
is
a
policy
which
emphasizes
these
values
of
finality.
the
--
2255
is
not
a
substitute
for
or
an
alternative
version
of
the
rule
33.
it
is
a
statute
which
makes
available
to
the
sentencing
court
a
remedy
in
the
great
tradition
of
habeas
corpus
for
errors
of
a
fundamental
constitutional
nature
affecting
the
legality
of
the
sentence.
not
just
all
errors
of
law
which
the
court
may
or
may
not
have
made
in
the
course
of
its
trial.
and
old
law
in
28
u.s.c.
2255
does
not
mean
that
all
errors
of
law
are
cognizable
in
a
2255
proceeding
and
this
court
has
always
described
the
section
and
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
precisely
those
terms.
some
of
the
other
policy
reasons
for
the
narrow
scope
to
collateral
attack
criminal
judgments
are
spelled
out
in
mr.
justice
powell’s
dissent
in
schneckloth
and
i
will
not
deal
with
them
further
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
quite
correct.
he’s
concurring
special
concurring
opinion
that
one
concurred
in
by
only
three
justices
in
the
court,
you’re
quite
right.
the
--
another
factor
i
think
that
finality
serves
is
the
important
factor
of
insuring
that
the
effort
in
trying
criminal
cases
concentrated
in
the
first
trial.
and
that
there
is
not
a
general
feeling
of
on
always
available
another
remedy
that
we
will
try
defense
line
one
at
this
trial
and
defense
line
two.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
no,
because
it’s
been
litigated
before.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
in
the
state
court?
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
no,
we
do
not
rely
upon
the
aspect
of
the
prior
litigation
of
the
issue.
if
in
this
case
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
their
opinion
is
enigmatic
and
brief.
they
appear
to
some
extent.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
to
that,
we
do
not
rely
upon
the
theory
and
the
reason
is
that
we
feel
that
here
or
there
has
been
a
vigorous
and
effective
effort
to
pursue
all
remedies.
and
that
the
fact
that
remedies
were
pursued
in
direct
appeal
should
not
result
in
their
denial
in
collateral
attack
if
they
are
available
that
this
petitioner
should
not
be
in
the
worst
position
than
a
petitioner
who
had
not
appealed.
in
fact,
he
should
be
in
the
better
position
because
he
has
responsibly
pursued
his
remedies,
and
he
is
quite
correct
when
he
says
he
is
in
that
position.
we
don’t
think
he
should
be
penalized
for
failing
to
responsibly
pursue
his
remedies.
now,
there’s
a
separate
issue,
a
related
issue
in
the
habeas
corpus
tradition
about
when
the
failure
to
pursue
remedies
available
on
direct
appeal,
results
in
a
denial
of
the
right
to
the
writ
and
of
course
in
sunal
against
large
in
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
court
said
that
the
failure
to
appeal
there
resulted
in
denial
of
the
availability
of
the
writ.
that
issue
is
not
before
us
and
the
extent
to
which
that
bypass
of
remedies
has
to
be
conscious
knowing
or
reach
the
level
of
waiver
is
a
separate
issue.
there
may
be
cases
where
the
failure
to
pursue
a
remedy
will
of
itself
deny
habeas
corpus
relief,
collateral
attack
relief
without
regard
to
the
nature
of
the
issue.
but
where
the
relief
has
been
pursued
on
direct
appeal,
i
don’t
think
we
can
responsibly
say
that
petitioner
has
somehow
lost
his
collateral
remedies.
now,
the
history
of
habeas
corpus
has
been
canvased
in
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
the
literature.
it’s
limited
some
of
its
scope
as
always
been
emphasized.
and
we
rely
upon
those
precedents
in
that
history
and
there
is
not
as
far
as
we’re
aware
precedent
in
this
court
where
habeas
corpus
has
issued
for
a
non-consti
--
for
a
claim
which
do
not
relate
to
the
denial
of
non-constitutional
right.
i’d
like
to
turn
now
and
discuss
our
view
of
the
questions
to
whether
the
conviction
was
proper
and
petitioner’s
arguments
on
the
merits.
in
our
view,
the
gutknecht
decision
is
simply
not
in
point,
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned.
as
we
read
gutknecht,
it
held
that
the
delinquency
regulations
were
not
--
could
not
be
used
by
the
selective
service
system
to
punish
registrants
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
violations
of
the
regulations
that
the
punitive
scheme
of
the
statute
is
a
criminal
scheme
and
that
the
enforcement
through
the
criminal
law
is
the
exclusive
means
for
extracting
compliance
with
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
selective
service
system.
and
in
the
gutknecht
case
of
course,
the
record
clearly
showed
an
application
of
just
such
a
punitive
use
of
a
delinquency
regulation.
as
soon
as
the
petitioner
in
gutknecht
had
--
where
the
defendant
in
gutknecht
had
sent
his
draft
card
into
the
draft
board,
he
was
declared
delinquent
and
immediately
ordered
to
report
for
induction.
now,
the
record
here
is
quite
different.
the
record
here
shows
that
between
the
initial
notice
to
report
for
physical
examination
and
the
final
second
order
of
induction,
there
was
a
long
and
patient
effort
by
this
draft
board
to
locate
and
obtain
from
the
registrant
fundamental
substantial
compliance
with
his
obligations
under
the
selective
service
system.
when
he
failed
to
appear
for
his
first
physical
examination,
he
wrote
to
the
board,
explained
that
he
had
been
ill
and
the
board
responded
simply
by
ordering
him
for
another
physical
examination.
and
just
as
he
was
about
to
be
declared
a
delinquent
after
having
failed
to
appear
twice,
he
appeared
again
and
gave
a
new
address,
and
the
board
then
did
not,
having
him
prosecuted
for
failing
to
appear
for
physical,
the
board
merely
sent
him
an
order
to
that
address
to
appear
for
induction.
due
to
this
patience
and
the
record
is
ambiguous
as
to
whether
this
was
a
young
man
who
is
confused
about
his
obligations
or
a
young
man
who
is
attempting
to
evade
his
obligations
and
that’s
i
think
counts
for
the
patience
of
the
board,
by
the
time
the
induction
order
came
about,
he
was
behind
others
in
the
same
age
category
who
had
complied
with
their
obligations
under
the
statute
and
have
been
ordered
for
induction
and
were
inducted.
so
he
benefited
from
the
difficulties
he
had
from
the
selective
services
to
whatever
the
reasons
that
they
occurred.
now,
the
delinquency
regulations
as
they
remain
after
gutknecht
continue
to
serve
other
purposes
than
those
held
bad
in
gutknecht
and
enable
the
selective
services
system
simply
to
keep
track
of
the
compliance
status
of
registrants.
they
enable
the
service
to
notify
registrants
of
compliance
difficulties
and
they
reflect
i
think
together
with
the
amendment
to
the
regulation
of
1970
to
simply
provide
for
induction
orders
without
medical
examinations,
a
policy
of
minimum
criminalization
that
is
if
young
man
can
be
induced
to
report
for
induction,
even
though
they
did
not
report
for
medical
examination
there
is
not
an
effort
to
escalate
the
sanction
and
to
make
everyone
who
does
not
appear
for
medical
examination
an
immediate
subject
of
a
prosecution
under
the
criminal
statute.
in
the
face
of
this
argument,
position
to
petitioner
is
that
since
under
the
regulation,
you
had
to
be
declared
delinquent
to
be
inducted
without
a
medical
examination,
he
lost
his
right
to
a
pre-induction
medical
examination
and
this
right
conferred
by
the
regulations
is
of
such
a
substance
that
it
required
that
he
not
be
convicted
and
that
it
be
available
in
collateral
attack.
in
his
reply
brief
to
our
position
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
petitioner
suggested
his
real
theory
was
that
there
was
a
statutory
right
relying
upon
the
castillo
opinion
to
our
pre-induction
physical,
that
argument
he
has
now
abandoned.
if
there
is
any
technical
error
in
the
processing
of
this
induction
order
as
a
result
of
the
complexities
of
the
fallout
of
gutknecht
in
the
time
in
the
fact
that
this
induction
order
was
issued
before
the
selective
service
opinion,
the
system
had
the
advantage
of
the
gutknecht
opinion.
we
argue
that
error
is
entirely
technical.
it
is
harmless
error
and
would
not
be
available
in
any
case
at
the
original
trial
as
a
defense
and
therefore
also,
the
conviction
was
proper.
now
as
to
retroactivity
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes,
it
is
my
understanding
that
it’s
all
under
the
same
section
of
the
statute
462
which
does
provide
for
generally
--
generally
for
violations
selective
service
regulation.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
well,
i
think
that
we
could
do
that
or
we
could
--
we
really
have
no
problem
after
the
amendment
of
the
regulations
in
1970
which
eliminated
the
category
of
delinquency
as
a
basis
for
issuing
an
induction
order
without
a
pre-induction
physical.
if
a
man
did
not
appear
for
their
physical,
the
system
can
move
ahead
without
the
physical
and
the
induction
order
can
be
issued
in
normal
course
without
any
declaration
of
delinquency
and
at
that
point
issues
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes.
but
the
regulations
were
so
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
the
amendment
regulation
is
reprinted
in
our
brief
at
page
--
on
page
7.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
“notwithstanding
any
other
provision
when
a
registrant
classified
class
1-a
and
so
on
has
refused
or
otherwise
failed
to
comply
with
an
order
report
for
and
submit
to
an
armed
forces
physical
exam,
he
maybe
selected
in
order
to
report
for
induction
even
though
he
is
not
been
found
acceptable.”
there
is
a
regulation
basically
requires
the
examination
of
statement
of
acceptability
than
it
provides
an
exception
for
persons
who
fail
to
report
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
it
is
not
a
sole
declaration
of
delinquency.
it’s
--
it
doesn’t
go
through
the
delinquency
regulation.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes,
precisely.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
is
correct,
yes,
yes,
and
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
continues
to
be
true.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
right
and
therefore,
we
don’t
have
the
argument
that
relying
--
the
argument
can’t
be
made
relying
upon
delinquency
regulations
under
gutknecht
as
a
precondition
for
issuance
of
the
order.
the
thing
is
it
should
be
emphasize
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
is
also
true.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
right.
although,
i
think
you
can
tell
from
many
of
the
cases
that
often
the
induction
order
is
issued
and
then
if
induction
takes
place,
that’s
the
end
of
it.
if
there
isn’t
an
induction
and
sometimes
the
induction
charge
is
joined
with
the
physical
charge.
here,
there
was
a
two-year
gap
between
the
physical
and
the
induction
which
may
have
been
the
factor
and
the
failure
to
join
the
physical
--
failure
to
appear
for
the
physical
in
the
charge.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
now
--
but,
i
think
is
important
to
emphasize
that
under
that
the
pre-amended
procedure,
the
pre-gutknecht
procedure
and
the
procedure
now,
the
physical
is
still
given
before
induction
occurs.
it’s
given
at
the
induction
station
and
if
the
young
man
is
found
not
acceptable
by
the
military,
he
is
not
inducted.
he
still
then
has
the
right
if
you
will,
he
is
still
able
to
demonstrate
his
unsuitability
for
the
armed
forces
and
avoid
the
effect
of
the
induction
order.
it’s
just
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
no,
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
that
if
it
was
within
the
statute
limitations,
but
i
believe
it’s
our
policy
not
to
prosecute
for
that
offense
alone
where
he
has
appeared
for
induction
and
then
defendant
that
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that’s
right.
the
--
i
think
one
has
to
understand
this
is
difficult
business
of
the
administration
selective
services
involving
young
man.
many
of
whom
are
confused
about
their
obligations
and
rights
and
if
the
induction
order
instead
of
proceeding
from
the
failure
to
appear
for
the
physical
right
criminal
prosecution
but
proceeding
through
in
the
induction
order,
the
induction
order
which
has
a
little
more
gravity
to
it,
it
may
make
many
of
these
young
men
realized
that
they
actually
should
appear
and
have
to
appear
and
may
keep
out
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
many
young
man
of
good
intent
and
who
are
confused,
and
i
think
that’s
the
policy,
the
benevolent
policy
that
is
reflected
in
the
record
of
this
case
that
underlies
the
thrust
so
it's
just
a
very
different
manner
than
the
court
it
was
dealing
with
in
gutknecht.
sir?
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes,
he
did
and
that
is
provided
for
in
the
armed
forces
regulation.
on
retroactivity,
again,
the
court
in
zack
against
benson
on
which
petitioner
relies,
it
seems
to
upheld
the
rule
of
retroactivity
but
without
stating
there
is
an
issue
present
in
the
case,
and
i
don’t
think
that
petitioner
urges
that
we
are
now
foreclosed
from
having
review
of
the
retroactivity
of
the
ninth
circuit
rule
once
this
case
is
here.
but
we
do
feel
the
issue
is
the
retroactivity
of
fox
and
not
the
retroactivity
of
gutknecht.
of
course,
if
this
petitioner
contends
the
rules
are
precisely
the
same,
there’s
just
no
meaningful
distinction
between
the
cases,
then
this
point
has
no
separate
merit.
but
we
think
the
rules
are
quite
distinguishable
and
we
think
that
the
analysis
of
retroactivity
requires
that
the
court
look
at
the
possible
purposes
for
the
fox
rule
an
issue
on
which
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
not
very
expansive.
but
as
far
as
we
really
make
out,
the
rule
does
have
the
effect
of
just
saving
the
courts
from
the
kind
of
collateral
or
factually
inquiry
that
was
made
here
on
remand,
the
examination
of
the
delivery
list
and
that
kind
of
inquiry
a
court
might
well
feel
is
not
really
essential
to
the
systems
since
induction
can
be
accomplished
through
amendment
of
the
regulations
without
delinquency
declaration.
and
that
purpose,
it
seems
to
me
is
achieved
by
perspective
application
and
the
fact
that
the
courts
are
called
upon
to
examine
for
acceleration.
in
fact
in
those
few
cases
where
induction
orders
occurred
before
the
gutknecht
opinion
is
not
such
a
burden
on
the
courts
is
to
require
retroactivity
application
of
the
fox
rule.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
in
this
case
has
three
independently
sufficient
reasons
that
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
below
should
be
affirmed.
it
is
a
rhetorical
difficulty
with
our
posture
that
in
order
to
argue
any
one
point,
we
must
for
purposes
of
argument
concede
the
validity
of
petitioner’s
position
on
the
other
two
points,
and
then
my
brother
has
been
able
to
find
a
cumulatively,
we
concede
our
entire
case.
our
three
points
are
that
the
subject
matter
of
this
claim
is
not
cognizable
under
section
2255
proceeding,
brought
and
after
the
judgment
of
conviction
has
become
final.
that
in
any
event,
the
conviction
of
the
district
court
was
proper
and
that
if
it
was
not
proper
and
the
rule
of
united
states
against
fox
is
correct,
that
rule
should
not
be
applied
retroactively.
in
our
brief,
we
argue
the
merits
of
the
conviction
first
for
purposes
of
exposition,
however,
logically,
this
court
must
reach
the
jurisdictional
issue
under
2255
before
it
would
reach
the
merits
and
therefore
i
will
address
the
2255
question
first.
this
is
a
question
of
considerable
importance
on
which
even
a
casual
reading
of
the
many
court
of
appeals
opinion
dealing
with
2255
will
reveal
a
need
for
this
court’s
attention.
for
instance,
zack
against
benson
in
the
ninth
circuit
on
which
petitioner
relies
as
a
holding
on
all
points
of
the
court
with
his
position.
in
that
case,
the
ninth
circuit
was
not
aware
that
there
was
a
2255
issue
to
be
addressed
before
relief
should
be
automatically
granted.
i
have
discussed
our
position
in
this
case
with
a
number
of
members
of
the
bar
of
some
experienced
who
--
although
finding
our
position
persuasive,
have
expressed
some
surprise
in
saying
that
although
they
hadn’t
really
thought
about
it,
they
always
understood
that
the
federal
system
was
a
double
trial,
double
appeal
system.
you
went
in
first,
your
conviction
an
appeal,
and
then
you
had
a
second
bite
at
the
apple.
now
as
i
think,
we
have
argued
in
our
brief
and
on
the
basis
of
the
authorities
in
our
brief,
it’s
clear
the
2255
plays
a
very
narrow
role
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
the
reasons,
the
policy
reasons
for
this
narrow
scope
of
collateral
attack
after
a
criminal
judgment
becomes
final
are
i
think
important
ones
in
bear
repetition
here.
first
of
all
is
the
importance
of
finality
for
the
function
of
a
criminal
law
itself,
the
functions
of
rehabilitation
and
deterrence.
a
criminal
law
cannot
rehabilitate
if
the
convicted
defender
is
constantly
faced
with
the
uncertainty
about
whether
he’s
conviction
is
really
valid
and
whether
if
he
just
didn’t
raise
one
more
claim,
he
would
in
fact
discover
that
he
had
been
wrongly
and
unjustly
convicted.
also,
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
these
are
general
policy
reasons
why
2255
is
narrowly
available.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
no
sir.
i
think
our
opinion
--
our
position
in
this
case
is
sustainable
under
the
all
of
the
views
of
habeas
corpus
which
had
been
advanced
the
opinions
of
this
court.
your
opinion
in
fay
against
noia
or
the
dissenting
opinion
in
schneckloth.
your
opinion
in
fay
against
noia
assumes
that
where
--
in
habeas
corpus,
we’re
talking
about
allegations
of
denial
of
fundamental
constitutional
rights
which
go
to
the
very
heart
of
the
process
of
justice
itself.
and
that’s
not
the
kind
of
issue
and
claim
which
petitioner
makes
in
this
case
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
oh,
i
must
--
i
misunderstood.
we
certainly
--
there
are
different
kinds
of
issues
which
already
have
historically
and
under
the
opinions
of
this
court
been
treated
different
under
2255.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
no,
your
honor.
the
section
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
the
section
reads
a
prisoner
in
custody
under
sentence
of
a
court,
claiming
the
right
to
be
released
upon
the
ground
of
the
sentence
was
imposed
in
violation
of
the
constitution
or
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
the
habeas
statute
has
comparable
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that’s
correct,
and
not
a
sentence
of
a
court
which
is
imposed
after
error
in
the
trial.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
no,
the
sentence
itself
is
not
illegal.
this
is
collateral
attack
that
goes
to
the
legality
of
the
sentence,
and
the
modern
habeas
corpus
practice
which
this
court
has
developed
has
said
that
certain
errors
or
such
a
fundamental
nature
that
effect
the
very
legality
of
the
sentence
itself.
but
not
every
error
is
an
error
which
affects
the
legality
of
a
sentence.
this
court’s
own
policy
on
finality
in
criminal
judgments
has
said
and
i
don’t
mean
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
adopted
by
this
court.
rule
33
is
the
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
sent
to
the
congress
by
this
court
after
this
court
approved
them.
rule
33
provides
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
well,
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
the
congress
has
ceded
in
the
rules
as
transmitted
by
the
court
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
--
and
the
rules
provide
in
rule
33,
in
the
motion
for
new
trial
which
is
the
great
traditional
method
for
correction
of
errors
after
judgment
in
the
trial
court
that
errors
or
in
allegations
the
discovery
of
new
evidence
when
relief
is
sought
under
rule
33,
release
should
be
sought
within
two
years,
and
that
as
to
all
other
errors,
relief
should
be
sought
within
seven
days.
now,
i
think
that
the
policy
reflected
rule
33
which
is
subject
can
be
revised
is
a
policy
which
emphasizes
these
values
of
finality.
the
--
2255
is
not
a
substitute
for
or
an
alternative
version
of
the
rule
33.
it
is
a
statute
which
makes
available
to
the
sentencing
court
a
remedy
in
the
great
tradition
of
habeas
corpus
for
errors
of
a
fundamental
constitutional
nature
affecting
the
legality
of
the
sentence.
not
just
all
errors
of
law
which
the
court
may
or
may
not
have
made
in
the
course
of
its
trial.
and
old
law
in
28
u.s.c.
2255
does
not
mean
that
all
errors
of
law
are
cognizable
in
a
2255
proceeding
and
this
court
has
always
described
the
section
and
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
precisely
those
terms.
some
of
the
other
policy
reasons
for
the
narrow
scope
to
collateral
attack
criminal
judgments
are
spelled
out
in
mr.
justice
powell’s
dissent
in
schneckloth
and
i
will
not
deal
with
them
further
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
quite
correct.
he’s
concurring
special
concurring
opinion
that
one
concurred
in
by
only
three
justices
in
the
court,
you’re
quite
right.
the
--
another
factor
i
think
that
finality
serves
is
the
important
factor
of
insuring
that
the
effort
in
trying
criminal
cases
concentrated
in
the
first
trial.
and
that
there
is
not
a
general
feeling
of
on
always
available
another
remedy
that
we
will
try
defense
line
one
at
this
trial
and
defense
line
two.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
no,
because
it’s
been
litigated
before.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
in
the
state
court?
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
no,
we
do
not
rely
upon
the
aspect
of
the
prior
litigation
of
the
issue.
if
in
this
case
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
their
opinion
is
enigmatic
and
brief.
they
appear
to
some
extent.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
to
that,
we
do
not
rely
upon
the
theory
and
the
reason
is
that
we
feel
that
here
or
there
has
been
a
vigorous
and
effective
effort
to
pursue
all
remedies.
and
that
the
fact
that
remedies
were
pursued
in
direct
appeal
should
not
result
in
their
denial
in
collateral
attack
if
they
are
available
that
this
petitioner
should
not
be
in
the
worst
position
than
a
petitioner
who
had
not
appealed.
in
fact,
he
should
be
in
the
better
position
because
he
has
responsibly
pursued
his
remedies,
and
he
is
quite
correct
when
he
says
he
is
in
that
position.
we
don’t
think
he
should
be
penalized
for
failing
to
responsibly
pursue
his
remedies.
now,
there’s
a
separate
issue,
a
related
issue
in
the
habeas
corpus
tradition
about
when
the
failure
to
pursue
remedies
available
on
direct
appeal,
results
in
a
denial
of
the
right
to
the
writ
and
of
course
in
sunal
against
large
in
the
opinion
by
mr.
justice
douglas,
the
court
said
that
the
failure
to
appeal
there
resulted
in
denial
of
the
availability
of
the
writ.
that
issue
is
not
before
us
and
the
extent
to
which
that
bypass
of
remedies
has
to
be
conscious
knowing
or
reach
the
level
of
waiver
is
a
separate
issue.
there
may
be
cases
where
the
failure
to
pursue
a
remedy
will
of
itself
deny
habeas
corpus
relief,
collateral
attack
relief
without
regard
to
the
nature
of
the
issue.
but
where
the
relief
has
been
pursued
on
direct
appeal,
i
don’t
think
we
can
responsibly
say
that
petitioner
has
somehow
lost
his
collateral
remedies.
now,
the
history
of
habeas
corpus
has
been
canvased
in
the
opinions
of
this
court
in
the
literature.
it’s
limited
some
of
its
scope
as
always
been
emphasized.
and
we
rely
upon
those
precedents
in
that
history
and
there
is
not
as
far
as
we’re
aware
precedent
in
this
court
where
habeas
corpus
has
issued
for
a
non-consti
--
for
a
claim
which
do
not
relate
to
the
denial
of
non-constitutional
right.
i’d
like
to
turn
now
and
discuss
our
view
of
the
questions
to
whether
the
conviction
was
proper
and
petitioner’s
arguments
on
the
merits.
in
our
view,
the
gutknecht
decision
is
simply
not
in
point,
insofar
as
this
case
is
concerned.
as
we
read
gutknecht,
it
held
that
the
delinquency
regulations
were
not
--
could
not
be
used
by
the
selective
service
system
to
punish
registrants
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
violations
of
the
regulations
that
the
punitive
scheme
of
the
statute
is
a
criminal
scheme
and
that
the
enforcement
through
the
criminal
law
is
the
exclusive
means
for
extracting
compliance
with
the
regulations
promulgated
by
the
selective
service
system.
and
in
the
gutknecht
case
of
course,
the
record
clearly
showed
an
application
of
just
such
a
punitive
use
of
a
delinquency
regulation.
as
soon
as
the
petitioner
in
gutknecht
had
--
where
the
defendant
in
gutknecht
had
sent
his
draft
card
into
the
draft
board,
he
was
declared
delinquent
and
immediately
ordered
to
report
for
induction.
now,
the
record
here
is
quite
different.
the
record
here
shows
that
between
the
initial
notice
to
report
for
physical
examination
and
the
final
second
order
of
induction,
there
was
a
long
and
patient
effort
by
this
draft
board
to
locate
and
obtain
from
the
registrant
fundamental
substantial
compliance
with
his
obligations
under
the
selective
service
system.
when
he
failed
to
appear
for
his
first
physical
examination,
he
wrote
to
the
board,
explained
that
he
had
been
ill
and
the
board
responded
simply
by
ordering
him
for
another
physical
examination.
and
just
as
he
was
about
to
be
declared
a
delinquent
after
having
failed
to
appear
twice,
he
appeared
again
and
gave
a
new
address,
and
the
board
then
did
not,
having
him
prosecuted
for
failing
to
appear
for
physical,
the
board
merely
sent
him
an
order
to
that
address
to
appear
for
induction.
due
to
this
patience
and
the
record
is
ambiguous
as
to
whether
this
was
a
young
man
who
is
confused
about
his
obligations
or
a
young
man
who
is
attempting
to
evade
his
obligations
and
that’s
i
think
counts
for
the
patience
of
the
board,
by
the
time
the
induction
order
came
about,
he
was
behind
others
in
the
same
age
category
who
had
complied
with
their
obligations
under
the
statute
and
have
been
ordered
for
induction
and
were
inducted.
so
he
benefited
from
the
difficulties
he
had
from
the
selective
services
to
whatever
the
reasons
that
they
occurred.
now,
the
delinquency
regulations
as
they
remain
after
gutknecht
continue
to
serve
other
purposes
than
those
held
bad
in
gutknecht
and
enable
the
selective
services
system
simply
to
keep
track
of
the
compliance
status
of
registrants.
they
enable
the
service
to
notify
registrants
of
compliance
difficulties
and
they
reflect
i
think
together
with
the
amendment
to
the
regulation
of
1970
to
simply
provide
for
induction
orders
without
medical
examinations,
a
policy
of
minimum
criminalization
that
is
if
young
man
can
be
induced
to
report
for
induction,
even
though
they
did
not
report
for
medical
examination
there
is
not
an
effort
to
escalate
the
sanction
and
to
make
everyone
who
does
not
appear
for
medical
examination
an
immediate
subject
of
a
prosecution
under
the
criminal
statute.
in
the
face
of
this
argument,
position
to
petitioner
is
that
since
under
the
regulation,
you
had
to
be
declared
delinquent
to
be
inducted
without
a
medical
examination,
he
lost
his
right
to
a
pre-induction
medical
examination
and
this
right
conferred
by
the
regulations
is
of
such
a
substance
that
it
required
that
he
not
be
convicted
and
that
it
be
available
in
collateral
attack.
in
his
reply
brief
to
our
position
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
petitioner
suggested
his
real
theory
was
that
there
was
a
statutory
right
relying
upon
the
castillo
opinion
to
our
pre-induction
physical,
that
argument
he
has
now
abandoned.
if
there
is
any
technical
error
in
the
processing
of
this
induction
order
as
a
result
of
the
complexities
of
the
fallout
of
gutknecht
in
the
time
in
the
fact
that
this
induction
order
was
issued
before
the
selective
service
opinion,
the
system
had
the
advantage
of
the
gutknecht
opinion.
we
argue
that
error
is
entirely
technical.
it
is
harmless
error
and
would
not
be
available
in
any
case
at
the
original
trial
as
a
defense
and
therefore
also,
the
conviction
was
proper.
now
as
to
retroactivity
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes,
it
is
my
understanding
that
it’s
all
under
the
same
section
of
the
statute
462
which
does
provide
for
generally
--
generally
for
violations
selective
service
regulation.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
well,
i
think
that
we
could
do
that
or
we
could
--
we
really
have
no
problem
after
the
amendment
of
the
regulations
in
1970
which
eliminated
the
category
of
delinquency
as
a
basis
for
issuing
an
induction
order
without
a
pre-induction
physical.
if
a
man
did
not
appear
for
their
physical,
the
system
can
move
ahead
without
the
physical
and
the
induction
order
can
be
issued
in
normal
course
without
any
declaration
of
delinquency
and
at
that
point
issues
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes.
but
the
regulations
were
so
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
the
amendment
regulation
is
reprinted
in
our
brief
at
page
--
on
page
7.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
“notwithstanding
any
other
provision
when
a
registrant
classified
class
1-a
and
so
on
has
refused
or
otherwise
failed
to
comply
with
an
order
report
for
and
submit
to
an
armed
forces
physical
exam,
he
maybe
selected
in
order
to
report
for
induction
even
though
he
is
not
been
found
acceptable.”
there
is
a
regulation
basically
requires
the
examination
of
statement
of
acceptability
than
it
provides
an
exception
for
persons
who
fail
to
report
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
it
is
not
a
sole
declaration
of
delinquency.
it’s
--
it
doesn’t
go
through
the
delinquency
regulation.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes,
precisely.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
is
correct,
yes,
yes,
and
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
continues
to
be
true.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
right
and
therefore,
we
don’t
have
the
argument
that
relying
--
the
argument
can’t
be
made
relying
upon
delinquency
regulations
under
gutknecht
as
a
precondition
for
issuance
of
the
order.
the
thing
is
it
should
be
emphasize
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
is
also
true.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
right.
although,
i
think
you
can
tell
from
many
of
the
cases
that
often
the
induction
order
is
issued
and
then
if
induction
takes
place,
that’s
the
end
of
it.
if
there
isn’t
an
induction
and
sometimes
the
induction
charge
is
joined
with
the
physical
charge.
here,
there
was
a
two-year
gap
between
the
physical
and
the
induction
which
may
have
been
the
factor
and
the
failure
to
join
the
physical
--
failure
to
appear
for
the
physical
in
the
charge.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
now
--
but,
i
think
is
important
to
emphasize
that
under
that
the
pre-amended
procedure,
the
pre-gutknecht
procedure
and
the
procedure
now,
the
physical
is
still
given
before
induction
occurs.
it’s
given
at
the
induction
station
and
if
the
young
man
is
found
not
acceptable
by
the
military,
he
is
not
inducted.
he
still
then
has
the
right
if
you
will,
he
is
still
able
to
demonstrate
his
unsuitability
for
the
armed
forces
and
avoid
the
effect
of
the
induction
order.
it’s
just
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
no,
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
that
if
it
was
within
the
statute
limitations,
but
i
believe
it’s
our
policy
not
to
prosecute
for
that
offense
alone
where
he
has
appeared
for
induction
and
then
defendant
that
--
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that’s
right.
the
--
i
think
one
has
to
understand
this
is
difficult
business
of
the
administration
selective
services
involving
young
man.
many
of
whom
are
confused
about
their
obligations
and
rights
and
if
the
induction
order
instead
of
proceeding
from
the
failure
to
appear
for
the
physical
right
criminal
prosecution
but
proceeding
through
in
the
induction
order,
the
induction
order
which
has
a
little
more
gravity
to
it,
it
may
make
many
of
these
young
men
realized
that
they
actually
should
appear
and
have
to
appear
and
may
keep
out
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
many
young
man
of
good
intent
and
who
are
confused,
and
i
think
that’s
the
policy,
the
benevolent
policy
that
is
reflected
in
the
record
of
this
case
that
underlies
the
thrust
so
it's
just
a
very
different
manner
than
the
court
it
was
dealing
with
in
gutknecht.
sir?
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
that
is
correct.
mr.
edmund
w.
kitch
yes,
he
did
and
that
is
provided
for
in
the
armed
forces
regulation.
on
retroactivity,
again,
the
court
in
zack
against
benson
on
which
petitioner
relies,
it
seems
to
upheld
the
rule
of
retroactivity
but
without
stating
there
is
an
issue
present
in
the
case,
and
i
don’t
think
that
petitioner
urges
that
we
are
now
foreclosed
from
having
review
of
the
retroactivity
of
the
ninth
circuit
rule
once
this
case
is
here.
but
we
do
feel
the
issue
is
the
retroactivity
of
fox
and
not
the
retroactivity
of
gutknecht.
of
course,
if
this
petitioner
contends
the
rules
are
precisely
the
same,
there’s
just
no
meaningful
distinction
between
the
cases,
then
this
point
has
no
separate
merit.
but
we
think
the
rules
are
quite
distinguishable
and
we
think
that
the
analysis
of
retroactivity
requires
that
the
court
look
at
the
possible
purposes
for
the
fox
rule
an
issue
on
which
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
not
very
expansive.
but
as
far
as
we
really
make
out,
the
rule
does
have
the
effect
of
just
saving
the
courts
from
the
kind
of
collateral
or
factually
inquiry
that
was
made
here
on
remand,
the
examination
of
the
delivery
list
and
that
kind
of
inquiry
a
court
might
well
feel
is
not
really
essential
to
the
systems
since
induction
can
be
accomplished
through
amendment
of
the
regulations
without
delinquency
declaration.
and
that
purpose,
it
seems
to
me
is
achieved
by
perspective
application
and
the
fact
that
the
courts
are
called
upon
to
examine
for
acceleration.
in
fact
in
those
few
cases
where
induction
orders
occurred
before
the
gutknecht
opinion
is
not
such
a
burden
on
the
courts
is
to
require
retroactivity
application
of
the
fox
rule.
