justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
doane,
i
expect
--
notwithstanding
that
may
have
been
hew
position,
but
it’s
still
isn’t
there
of
--
that
maybe
their
interpretation,
but
the
language
of
the
statute
is
as
well
as
any
expenses
reasonably
attributable
to
the
earning
of
any
such
income.
so,
there’s
still
isn't
there
the
question
of
conflict
between
the
standard
allowance
and
the
–
and
the
statute
even
though
hew
apparently
from
this
letter
now
has
approved
the
standard
allowance
as
satisfying
that
requirement.
isn’t
that
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that's
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
any
expenses
is
satisfied
by
a
standard
allowance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
plus,
i
gather
this
petitioner
or
respondent
rather,
her
actual
expenses
were
a
$126.11,
weren’t
they?
and
i
gather
that
had
been
under
the
former
practice
in
colorado,
she’d
been
allowed
that,
had
she
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
the
complaint
or
let’s
say
constitutional
claim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
thank
you.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
[inaudible]
given
this
same
interpretation?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
conflict
as
i
understand?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
what
the
response
--
tenor
of
the
response
maybe?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
i
gather
mr.
armour,
there
are
--
suggest
that
or
implies
at
least
to
--
with
the
--
judge
rouse
thought
that
there
maybe
enough
for
the
convening
of
a
three-judge
court
about
that
--
in
your
constitutional
claim
about
that
--
he
wouldn’t
recommend
that
if
--
since
the
case
could
be
disposed
of
under
statutory
claim?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
falls?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
he
said
that
but
--
he
wouldn’t
convene
a
three-judge
court
since
there
was
--
or
wouldn’t
worth
convening,
only
if
the
case
can’t
be
disposed
of
on
the
statutory
ground?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
justified
and
in
goosby
last
year,
i
guess
we
set
down
the
standard
of
what
kind
of
constitutional
claim
required
the
convening
of
a
three
judge
court,
didn’t
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
it
wasn’t
a
non-frivolous
or
i've
forgotten
--
that’s
rather
a
broad
language.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
provision
may
not
be
a
stipulation,
but
at
least
intended
a
determination
by
the
judge
that
there
was
a
non-frivolous
constitutional
question,
but
let’s
go
on
and
decide
the
statutory
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
paragraph?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
on
beginning
the
new
regulations?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
hmm.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
mr.
doane,
i
expect
--
notwithstanding
that
