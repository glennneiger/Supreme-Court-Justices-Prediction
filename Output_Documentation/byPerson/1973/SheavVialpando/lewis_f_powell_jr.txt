in
shea
against
vialpando,
we
have
a
case
that's
here
from
certiorari,
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
the
provisions
of
the
social
security
act
providing
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
are
administered
by
the
states.
section
402
(a)
(7)
of
the
act
requires
that
the
states
take
into
consideration
any
expenses
reasonably
attributable
to
the
earning
of
income.
such
expenses
are
deducted
from
an
applicant's
income
in
determining
eligibility
for
assistance.
a
colorado
state
regulation
adopted
in
1970,
established
a
flat
uniform
allowance
for
work
related
expenses
of
$30
per
month.
respondent's
expenses
substantially
exceeded
this
$30,
making
her
ineligible
for
continued
assistance.
she
brought
this
action
for
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief.
we
hold
that
the
colorado
regulation,
imposing
what
in
effect
is
an
arbitrary
ceiling
on
work
related
expenses,
conflicts
with
section
402
(a)
(7),
and
therefore,
is
invalid.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
tenth
circuit.
