mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
comment
on
several
aspects
that
have
either
been
brought
by
the
court
or
by
mr.
armour.
now,
i
might
start
with
this
situation
that
existed
in
july
of
1970
when
colorado
chose
to
change
its
method
of
taking
into
consideration
work
expenses
as
mr.
armour
has
suggested
prior
to
july
the
method
involved
in
itemized
treatment
of
work
expenses
for
each
individual
recipient.
the
state’s
position
is
that
mrs.
vialpando
did
not
have
a
vested
right
to
that
earlier
regulation
or
to
that
method
and
that
the
state
as
long
as
they
acted
consistently
with
the
social
security
act
and
of
the
requirements
of
hew
could
elect
a
more
efficient
or
less
costly
method
to
take
work
expenses
into
consideration.
and
i
would
also
like
to
bring
out
that
we
have
all
at
the
counsel
side
of
the
case
dwelled
upon
the
$30.00
aspect
of
the
work
expenses
allowance,
but
it
should
be
noted
that
the
work
incentive
purpose
of
the
social
security
act
was
accomplished
not
only
by
the
$30.00
work
expense
allowance,
but
by
the
provision
of
the
colorado
rules
that
permitted
the
deduction
of
mandatory
payroll
deductions
such
as
state
taxes
and
social
security
and
also
the
actual
cost
of
child
care
was
deducted
from
income
in
determining
need.
so
this
work
incentive
in
colorado
after
july
of
1970
consistent
of
this
three-part
work
expense
--
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
the
purpose
of
the
standard
allowance
is
largely
to
reduce
the
amount
of
time
that
an
individual
eligibility
technician
at
the
county
level
has
to
spend
dealing
with
each
case
and
there’s
a
discounted
--
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
unless
the
staff
was
increased
considerably,
we
could
anticipate
that
it
would
delay
the
process
in
individual
cases.
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
correct.
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
under
the
older
rule
where
we
would
give
itemized
consideration,
once
she
was
no
longer
in
making
car
payments
they
would
no
longer
be
actual
work
expenses
and
her
work
expense
allowance
would
be
reduced
by
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
yes,
your
honor.
this
is
another
aspect
that
concerned
us.
this
was
an
individual
decision
in
an
individual
case
in
el
paso
county,
colorado.
the
same
facts
could’ve
been
presented
to
an
(inaudible)
technician
in
another
part
of
colorado
who
would
have
made
a
decision
on
a
rather
subjective
basis
equally
valid
saying
that
the
car
was
a
personal
expense,
that
a
job
was
available
closer
to
the
home
of
the
recipient
or
that
she
could
use
probably
transportation.
this
is
another
reason
why
colorado
prefers
to
use
a
flat
amount
so
that
there
were
will
be
a
more
accurate
and
a
more
consistent
determination
in
each
case
then
is
possible
without
some
type
of
numerical
guideline
on
what
is
a
reasonable
work
expense.
i
also
like
to
point
out
that
in
connection
with
the
statistical
tables
that
appear
in
our
appendix,
this
may
have
been
adequately
brought
up,
but
i
would
like
to
specifically
point
out
that
each
of
the
pages,
41a
and
there
after
consists
of
a
printout
of
all
of
the
aid
to
dependent
--
aid
to
families
or
dependent
children
cases
in
colorado
for
the
particular
month
and
mr.
freedman
in
his
analysis
on
pages
40
to
41
of
the
appendix,
took
the
items
from
the
left
hand
column
of
each
of
these
computer
printouts
and
pulled
out
the
general
work
expenses,
the
transportation
expenses.
he
excluded
childcare
because
that
was
going
to
be
allowed
separately,
took
out
union
dues,
tools,
telephone
and
computed
a
100%
average.
the
people
who
had
more
than
$30.00
prior
to
july
of
1970
are
included
in
each
of
these
printouts.
it’s
a
100%
sample
of
the
high
as
well
as
the
low
work
expense
allowance
cases.
so,
this
is
a
primary
part
of
our
position
that
a
flat
amount
does
take
into
consideration
not
only
any
type
of
expense,
but
also
considers
the
specific
amounts
that
were
being
spent
in
colorado
by
this
class
of
recipients.
then
i’d
like
to
comment
briefly
on
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
on
the
--
whether
or
not
it
would
be
permissible
for
colorado
to
have
a
$30.00
work
expense
allowance
and
then
if
a
particular
recipient
wanted
to
present
evidence
of
expenses
in
excess
of
$30.00
--
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
alright,
$10.00
this
would
--
as
another
touch
to
it
--
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
what
the
state’s
position
is
in
this
case
is
that
once
the
dollar
amount
is
fixed
by
a
reasonably
statistical
basis
it
could
if
it
wanted
to
pay
in
excess
of
that
average
figure,
but
it
doesn’t
have
to,
that
it’s
permissible
under
the
social
security
act
to
stick
with
the
flat
amount.
and
i
think
as
mr.
armour
responded,
the
position
of
hew
and
i
think
the
state’s
response
would
be
that
if
the
flat
amount
is
too
low,
this
would
present
a
problem
that
we
would
then
take
up
in
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
correct.
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
right.
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
i
think
that
it
could,
but
none
have
ever
done
it.
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
correct.
on
the
question
of
equal
protection,
i
must
apologize
we
don’t
we
have
the
record
with
us
today,
but
it
is
my
recollection
that
there’s
a
pretrial
order
early
in
the
trial
court
record
what
was
agreed
by
the
counsel
at
that
time
for
mrs.
vialpando
and
by
the
state
counsel
that
the
constitutional
issue
would
not
be
litigated
in
the
case
and
that
again
this
is
my
recollection,
that
is
the
basis
for
the
footnote
in
judge
rouse’s
opinion
saying
that
the
constitutional
question
would
not
be
taken
up.
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
i
forgot
the
exact
text
of
the
pretrial
order,
but
i
would
presume
that
the
context
was
that
there
was
a
constitutional
question
sufficient
to
give
pendent
jurisdiction
and
then
they
proceeded
to
handle
the
case
on
the
statutory
basis.
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
no,
i
think
judge
rouse
in
his
footnote
--
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
well,
as
i
said,
i
do
not
recall
the
exact
text.
we
should
have
included
it
in
the
appendix,
we
did
not,
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
pretrial
order
in
there
with
a
provision
on
the
constitutional
issue
which
is
the
basis
for
that
footnote
in
judge
rouse’s
initial
opinion.
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
this
is
my
recollection
of
what
happened.
if
this
court
was
to
raise
the
constitutional
issue,
i
believe
the
state
of
colorado
would
be
relying
on
the
case
of
dandridge
v.
williams
and
pointing
out
that
there
was
no
invidious
discrimination
in
the
use
of
a
flat
amount.
we
have
pointed
out
that
the
rational
basis
for
the
use
of
a
flat
amount
would
include
such
things
as
it
does
encourage
employment.
it
maintains
an
equitable
balance
economically
between
people
who
earn
low
salaries
and
are
not
on
public
assistance
programs
as
compared
to
people
who
are
on
public
assistance
programs.
and
it
does
serve
an
aspect
--
serve
the
purpose
of
helping
to
allocate
public
funds
to
serve
a
larger
number
of
individuals.
then
i’d
like
to
comment
upon
the
fact
that
i
believe
is
reflected
in
our
appendix
that
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
has
consistently
permitted
the
use
of
average
amounts
or
flat
amounts
for
at
least
some
types
of
work
expenses
both
prior
to
and
after
the
1962
statute
that’s
being
litigated
here.
i
believe
our
brief
might
be
more
helpful
to
the
court
if
on
page
24
of
the
brief
for
petitioners,
after
that
second
full
paragraph,
a
reference
were
inserted
to
appendix
f
of
the
amicus
brief
of
the
state
of
colorado
or
the
state
of
california,
i’m
sorry,
the
amicus
brief
for
the
state
of
california
filed
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
i’m
suggesting
a
reference
be
inserted
after
the
second
full
paragraph
on
page
--
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
yes,
we’re
talking
about
--
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
--
new
regulations
and
then
this
letter
that
i
am
referring
to
in
the
california
amicus
brief
in
appendix
f
is
a
letter
from
the
commissioner,
a
memorandum
from
the
commissioner
of
the
social
rehabilitation
service
indicating
that
the
handbook
sections
that
had
been
previously
utilized
were
obsolete
because
i
think
that
bears
upon
the
consistency
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare’s
interpretation
of
the
statute
--
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
it’s
appendix
f,
it
would
be
on
page
29
in
their
appendix.
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
because
it
--
it
is
really
not
completely
clear
what
the
legal
effect
of
the
handbook
is,
we
are
suggesting
to
the
court
that
the
--
in
--
i
think
is
why
the
state
of
colorado,
mr.
doane
was
saying,
the
state
of
colorado
looked
at
the
social
security
act
back
in
1970,
looked
at
the
federal
regulations
published
in
the
federal
register,
looked
at
the
letter
dated
september
29th
of
1969
from
the
commissioner
of
the
social
rehabilitation
service
and
that
letter
is
printed
on
page
7
of
the
joint
appendix
clearly
permitting
the
use
of
a
flat
work
expense
allowance.
against
this
--
another
thing
i
think
that
is
involved
here
is
that
there
is
really
no
apparent
legal
difference
between
this
september
26,
1969
letter
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page
7
and
the
circular
that
was
involved
in
the
case
of
thorpe
versus
the
housing
authority
of
durham,
though
the
circular
in
the
durham
case
was
a
mandatory
requirement,
in
this
case,
it
provides
an
option.
but
we
are
suggesting
to
the
court
that
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
is
indicated
by
the
--
by
this
letter
and
should
be
given
effect
by
this
court.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
comment
on
several
aspects
that
have
either
been
brought
by
the
court
or
by
mr.

we
don’t
we
have
the
record
with
us
today,
but
it
is
my
recollection
that
there’s
a
pretrial
order
early
in
the
trial
court
record
what
was
agreed
by
the
counsel
at
that
time
for
mrs.
vialpando
and
by
the
state
counsel
that
the
constitutional
issue
would
not
be
litigated
in
the
case
and
that
again
this
is
my
recollection,
that
is
the
basis
for
the
footnote
in
judge
rouse’s
opinion
saying
that
the
constitutional
question
would
not
be
taken
up.
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
i
forgot
the
exact
text
of
the
pretrial
order,
but
i
would
presume
that
the
context
was
that
there
was
a
constitutional
question
sufficient
to
give
pendent
jurisdiction
and
then
they
proceeded
to
handle
the
case
on
the
statutory
basis.
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
no,
i
think
judge
rouse
in
his
footnote
--
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
well,
as
i
said,
i
do
not
recall
the
exact
text.
we
should
have
included
it
in
the
appendix,
we
did
not,
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
pretrial
order
in
there
with
a
provision
on
the
constitutional
issue
which
is
the
basis
for
that
footnote
in
judge
rouse’s
initial
opinion.
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
this
is
my
recollection
of
what
happened.
if
this
court
was
to
raise
the
constitutional
issue,
i
believe
the
state
of
colorado
would
be
relying
on
the
case
of
dandridge
v.
williams
and
pointing
out
that
there
was
no
invidious
discrimination
in
the
use
of
a
flat
amount.
we
have
pointed
out
that
the
rational
basis
for
the
use
of
a
flat
amount
would
include
such
things
as
it
does
encourage
employment.
it
maintains
an
equitable
balance
economically
between
people
who
earn
low
salaries
and
are
not
on
public
assistance
programs
as
compared
to
people
who
are
on
public
assistance
programs.
and
it
does
serve
an
aspect
--
serve
the
purpose
of
helping
to
allocate
public
funds
to
serve
a
larger
number
of
individuals.
then
i’d
like
to
comment
upon
the
fact
that
i
believe
is
reflected
in
our
appendix
that
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
has
consistently
permitted
the
use
of
average
amounts
or
flat
amounts
for
at
least
some
types
of
work
expenses
both
prior
to
and
after
the
1962
statute
that’s
being
litigated
here.
i
believe
our
brief
might
be
more
helpful
to
the
court
if
on
page
24
of
the
brief
for
petitioners,
after
that
second
full
paragraph,
a
reference
were
inserted
to
appendix
f
of
the
amicus
brief
of
the
state
of
colorado
or
the
state
of
california,
i’m
sorry,
the
amicus
brief
for
the
state
of
california
filed
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
i’m
suggesting
a
reference
be
inserted
after
the
second
full
paragraph
on
page
--
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
yes,
we’re
talking
about
--
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
--
new
regulations
and
then
this
letter
that
i
am
referring
to
in
the
california
amicus
brief
in
appendix
f
is
a
letter
from
the
commissioner,
a
memorandum
from
the
commissioner
of
the
social
rehabilitation
service
indicating
that
the
handbook
sections
that
had
been
previously
utilized
were
obsolete
because
i
think
that
bears
upon
the
consistency
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare’s
interpretation
of
the
statute
--
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
it’s
appendix
f,
it
would
be
on
page
29
in
their
appendix.
mr.
charles
b.
lennahan
because
it
--
it
is
really
not
completely
clear
what
the
legal
effect
of
the
handbook
is,
we
are
suggesting
to
the
court
that
the
--
in
--
i
think
is
why
the
state
of
colorado,
mr.
doane
was
saying,
the
state
of
colorado
looked
at
the
social
security
act
back
in
1970,
looked
at
the
federal
regulations
published
in
the
federal
register,
looked
at
the
letter
dated
september
29th
of
1969
from
the
commissioner
of
the
social
rehabilitation
service
and
that
letter
is
printed
on
page
7
of
the
joint
appendix
clearly
permitting
the
use
of
a
flat
work
expense
allowance.
against
this
--
another
thing
i
think
that
is
involved
here
is
that
there
is
really
no
apparent
legal
difference
between
this
september
26,
1969
letter
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page
7
and
the
circular
that
was
involved
in
the
case
of
thorpe
versus
the
housing
authority
of
durham,
though
the
circular
in
the
durham
case
was
a
mandatory
requirement,
in
this
case,
it
provides
an
option.
but
we
are
suggesting
to
the
court
that
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
of
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
is
indicated
by
the
--
by
this
letter
and
should
be
given
effect
by
this
court.
thank
you.
