mr.
douglas
d.
doane
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
colorado
is
here
today
to
ask
the
court
to
assist
colorado
to
remove
the
federal
courts
from
the
administration
of
the
welfare
programs.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
the
respondent,
mrs.
vialpando
was
working
and
receiving
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
and
she
was
provided
certain
work
expenses
under
the
social
security
act
which
required
that
the
state
agency
in
determining
need
for
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
must
take
into
consideration,
expenses
reasonably
attributable
to
the
earning
of
income.
the
statutory
language
is
not
specific
as
to
how
this
is
to
be
done.
in
colorado,
prior
to
july
of
1970,
it
had
a
policy
which
provided
for
consideration
of
employment
expenses
by
the
itemization
of
each
and
every
expense
which
the
--
which
the
welfare
recipient
have
and
under
this
system,
mrs.
vialpando
was
able
to
reduce
her
income
by
a
certain
amount
of
employment
expenses
and
under
the
previous
system
she
was
able
to
deduct
approximately
$181.00
of
her
income
and
her
income
was
about
$281.00
per
month.
so
this
made
her
eligible
and
made
her
needy
under
colorado’s
program.
after
july
of
1970,
however,
colorado
changed
its
policy
and
provided
for
taking
into
the
consideration
employment
expenses,
expenses
reasonably
attributable
to
the
earning
of
income
by
allowing
deduction
of
mandatory
deductions
from
income.
also,
a
$30.00
flat
allowance
which
was
statistically
based
and
the
way
colorado
arrived
at
this
$30.00
figure
was
to
take
for
a
period
of
months
during
1969
and
1970,
all
of
the
actual
employment
expenses
of
all
the
recipients
for
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
and
strike
an
average
and
in
our
brief
in
the
appendix,
it’s
indicated
these
figures
range
from
about
$32.00
to
$36.00.
colorado
therefore
and
its
policy
said,
“we
will
strike
an
average
allowance
for
employment
expenses
at
$30.00.”
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
well,
the
state
of
colorado
felt
that
it
was
taking
into
consideration
expenses
attributable
to
the
earning
of
income
by
basing
it
upon
what
the
employment
expenses
were
and
not
using
the
actual
figure.
in
both
of
the
lower
court
decisions,
they
do
not
pass
upon
whether
the
$30.00
is
an
actual
sufficient
amount
or
whether
it
is
statistically
correct.
what
they
say
in
the
lower
courts
is
that
the
state
may
not
use
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
it
seemed
to
be
a
sufficient
taking
into
consideration
of
expenses
reasonably
attributable.
in
other
words,
they
based
it
upon
that.
the
statute
does
not
in
our
opinion
say
that
you
have
to
allow
what
the
actual
average
was.
it’s
i
think
similar
to
a
case
the
court
had
previously
in
rosado
versus
wyman
were
the
court
found
that
you
could
use
statistically
based
averages
as
long
as
they
were
fairly
priced
and
that
some
people
would
have
an
advantage
by
the
use
of
that
average,
other
peoples
would
--
other
people
would
be
disadvantaged.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
the
person
who
gains
is
the
person
who
does
not
have
$30.00
of
employment
expenses.
this
was
not
actual
payment
of
expenses
up
to
a
ceiling
of
$30.00
regardless
of
whoever
was
and
what
are
their
expenses
were,
they
got
to
full
$30.00.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
some
people
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
no,
this
was
the
average
figure
your
honor.
for
a
--
in
our
brief
or
in
the
appendix
rather
at
page
40,
it's
set
out
how
the
average
was
determined.
for
example,
for
the
month
of
march
1969,
the
average
per
case
was
$32.44.
now,
the
very
nature
of
an
average
would
mean
that
some
persons
would
have
expenses
less
than
the
average,
others
would
have
expenses
higher
than
the
average.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
page
41.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes,
your
honors.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
a
range
of
averages,
correct.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
in
other
months
it
would
run
$36.00.
the
last
one,
april
of
1970
ran
$36.00,
but
the
state
does
not
claim
that
the
$30.00
is
all
that
a
work
expense
allowance
should
be.
the
state
of
colorado
is
here
today
stating
that
the
statute
does
not
prohibit
the
use
of
an
average
and
the
lower
court
seem
to
feel
that
the
statute
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
no
your
honor,
the
average
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
has
not
been
adjusted.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
--
but
i
would
assume
that
it
would
have
to
be
adjusted
upward
with
the
cost
of
living,
but
the
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes
your
honor,
i
do.
the
federal
statute
in
this
case
provides
that
the
states
in
determining
need
must
take
into
consideration
expenses
reasonably
attributable
to
the
earning
of
income.
reasonably
attributable
would
seem
to
require
that
someone
has
to
decide
how
you
determine
what
expenses
are
reasonably
attributable.
the
federal
regulations
in
this
case
are
both
in
the
federal
register
and
in
the
form
of
handbook
material
and
circulars.
this
type
of
regulation
both
of
which
we
feel
are
binding
upon
the
state,
mainly
restate
what
the
statute
provides.
there
is
some
statement
in
the
federal
regulations
that
certain
items
maybe
standardized,
but
prior
to
the
time
colorado
implemented
this
standard
flat
expense
allowance,
the
federal
regulations
both
--
the
federal
regu
--
federal
register
regulations
and
the
circulars
allowed
for
the
use
of
a
standard
expense
allowance.
and
mrs.
vialpando
alleges
that
colorado
can
only
accommodate
this
requirement
of
the
statute
by
itemizing
all
expenses
and
there’s
no
other
way
to
do
it.
as
i
mentioned
previously
in
rosado,
the
court
did
allow
the
use
of
standard
--
standardizing
and
averaging
as
long
as
the
items
in
the
average
were
fairly
priced.
the
court
has
also
held
in
the
welfare
areas
and
recently
in
the
dablino
case
that
the
federal
law
is
to
be
looked
at
carefully
and
if
there
is
not
a
specific
statutory
requirement
or
if
there
is
not
a
condition
of
eligibility
being
added
by
the
state
that
the
states
do
have
discretion
in
this
difficult
area
in
the
--
the
courts
are
--
the
lower
courts
have
been
cautioned
by
this
court
to
not
get
into
the
are
of
--
determine
what
might
be
in
its
opinion
the
best
way
to
--
to
administer
the
welfare
program.
colorado’s
position
is
that
this
--
this
afdc
statute
is
merely
setting
out
of
the
basic
state
plan
requirements.
it
doesn’t
spell
out
of
every
detail,
period
and
comma
to
have
a
program
which
complies
with
the
statute,
that
there
are
other
requirements
in
the
statute
that
have
to
be
accommodated
also.
one
is
that
the
states
must
in
a
prompt
manner
determine
eligibility
and
provide
benefits
to
those
who
are
eligible.
the
determination
of
employment
expenses
only
on
an
item
by
item
basis
would
have
to
be
done
every
month
for
every
welfare
recipient
not
only
to
determine
eligibility,
but
to
determine
the
amount
of
assistance
and
the
cost
of
administering
this
type
of
a
determination
would
take
a
lot
of
money
from
the
actual
benefits
going
to
the
welfare
recipient
and
use
it
up
for
administrative
expenses.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
hew
requires
that
the
states
must
promptly
determine
eligibility
for
assistance
and
the
amount
of
assistance.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
no
your
honor.
their
position
as
stated
in
the
solicitor
general’s
amicus
brief
is
that
averaging
in
standard
employment
allowances
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
the
most
recent
letter?
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
pardon?
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes
your
honor,
that’s
correct.
the
solicitor
was
advised
by
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
that
even
back
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
well,
yes
your
honor
it
does.
we’re
saying
that
at
the
time
colorado
implemented
the
standard
employment
allowance,
it
was
permitted
by
hew
and
that
was
their
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
this
letter
even
goes
further
back,
way
back
to
1964.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes,
your
honor,
the
question
before
the
court
is,
does
the
statute
allow
both
hew
and
the
state
to
standardize
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
which
is
when
this
language
in
the
statute
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes,
she
had
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes,
your
honor.
that’s
exactly
correct
so
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
any
means
any
and
any
would
mean
all
and
the
language
we
think
is
most
important
is
the
first
part,
it
says
the
state
in
determining
need
and
in
determining
the
need,
the
state
has
always
had
large
discretion
as
to
how
they
do
this,
shall
take
into
consideration
and
take
into
consideration
does
not
mean
shall
deduct
all
because
if
the
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
well,
i
would
question
that
type
of
an
allowance
because
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
--
in
that
case
you’re
not
reviewing
full
consideration
to
the
actual
expenses,
you
only
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
you
--
it
could
be
argued
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
well,
it
depends
how
the
state
is
required
by
the
statute
to
take
into
consideration
expenses.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
and
the
following
section
of
the
statute
after
the
one
that
we’re
concerned
with
talks
about
“and
the
state
shall
disregard
certain
income.”
now,
if
congress
had
intended
the
state
must
deduct
all
employment
expenses,
they
could
have
very
easily,
put
this
provision
on
deducting
employment
expenses
down
in
the
next
section
which
really
says
disregard
which
means
deduct
to
me.
the
language
is
a
lot
different
“take
into
consideration
and
deduct”
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
no,
your
honor.
it’s
a
strictly
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
it
does
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
well,
your
honor,
i
think
pendent
jurisdiction
would
have
allowed
the
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
no,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
have
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes,
it
did.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
page
14th.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
--
if
the
court
is
interested
in
that
area,
the
–
it
would
appear
then
at
the
federal
statute
does
provide
the
state
of
colorado,
the
option
as
to
what
method
to
select
in
determining
and
considering
what
expenses
are
reasonably
attributable
and
that
the
lower
court’s
determinations
that
there
was
no
such
discretion
that
there
only
was
one
way
to
meet
the
requirement
of
the
statute
gave
no
effect
to
the
words
“reasonably
attributable”
that
the
lower
court
should
be
reversed.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
colorado
is
here
today
to
ask
the
court
to
assist
colorado
to
remove
the
federal
courts
from
the
administration
of
the
welfare
programs.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
that
the
respondent,
mrs.
vialpando
was
working
and
receiving
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
and
she
was
provided
certain
work
expenses
under
the
social
security
act
which
required
that
the
state
agency
in
determining
need
for
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
must
take
into
consideration,
expenses
reasonably
attributable
to
the
earning
of
income.
the
statutory
language
is
not
specific
as
to
how
this
is
to
be
done.
in
colorado,
prior
to
july
of
1970,
it
had
a
policy
which
provided
for
consideration
of
employment
expenses
by
the
itemization
of
each
and
every
expense
which
the
--
which
the
welfare
recipient
have
and
under
this
system,
mrs.
vialpando
was
able
to
reduce
her
income
by
a
certain
amount
of
employment
expenses
and
under
the
previous
system
she
was
able
to
deduct
approximately
$181.00
of
her
income
and
her
income
was
about
$281.00
per
month.
so
this
made
her
eligible
and
made
her
needy
under
colorado’s
program.
after
july
of
1970,
however,
colorado
changed
its
policy
and
provided
for
taking
into
the
consideration
employment
expenses,
expenses
reasonably
attributable
to
the
earning
of

by
allowing

of

also,
a
$30.00
flat

which
was

the
way
colorado
arrived
at
this
$30.00
figure
was
to
take
for
a
period
of
months
during
1969
and
1970,
all
of
the
actual
employment
expenses
of
all
the
recipients
for
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children
and
strike
an
average
and
in
our
brief
in
the
appendix,
it’s
indicated
these
figures
range
from
about
$32.00
to
$36.00.
colorado
therefore
and
its
policy
said,
“we
will
strike
an
average
allowance
for
employment
expenses
at
$30.00.”
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
well,
the
state
of
colorado
felt
that
it
was
taking
into
consideration
expenses
attributable
to
the
earning
of
income
by
basing
it
upon
what
the
employment
expenses
were
and
not
using
the
actual
figure.
in
both
of
the
lower
court
decisions,
they
do
not
pass
upon
whether
the
$30.00
is
an
actual
sufficient
amount
or
whether
it
is
statistically
correct.
what
they
say
in
the
lower
courts
is
that
the
state
may
not
use
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
it
seemed
to
be
a
sufficient
taking
into
consideration
of
expenses
reasonably
attributable.
in
other
words,
they
based
it
upon
that.
the
statute
does
not
in
our
opinion
say
that
you
have
to
allow
what
the
actual
average
was.
it’s
i
think
similar
to

mr.
douglas
d.
doane
the
person
who
gains
is
the
person
who
does
not
have
$30.00
of
employment
expenses.
this
was
not
actual
payment
of
expenses
up
to
a
ceiling
of
$30.00
regardless
of
whoever
was
and
what
are
their
expenses
were,
they
got
to
full
$30.00.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
some
people
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
no,
this
was
the
average
figure
your
honor.
for
a

it's
set
out
how

was
determined.
for

for

1969,
the

was
$32.44.
now,
the
very
nature
of
an
average
would
mean
that
some
persons
would
have
expenses
less
than
the
average,
others
would
have
expenses
higher
than
the
average.

mr.

doane
a
range
of
averages,
correct.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
in
other
months
it
would
run
$36.00.
the
last
one,
april
of
1970
ran
$36.00,
but
the
state
does
not
claim
that
the
$30.00
is
all
that

allowance
should

have
to
be
adjusted
upward
with
the
cost
of
living,
but
the
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes
your
honor,
i
do.
the
federal
statute
in
this
case
provides
that
the
states
in
determining
need
must
take
into
consideration
expenses
reasonably
attributable
to
the
earning
of
income.
reasonably
attributable
would
seem
to
require
that
someone
has
to
decide
how
you
determine
what
expenses
are
reasonably
attributable.
the
federal
regulations
in
this
case
are
both
in
the
federal
register
and
in
the
form
of
handbook
material
and
circulars.
this
type
of
regulation
both
of
which
we
feel
are
binding
upon
the
state,
mainly
restate
what
the
statute
provides.
there
is
some
statement
in
the
federal
regulations
that
certain
items
maybe
standardized,
but
prior
to
the
time
colorado
implemented
this
standard
flat
expense
allowance,
the
federal
regulations
both
--
the
federal
regu
--
federal
register
regulations
and
the
circulars
allowed
for
the
use
of
a
standard
expense
allowance.
and
mrs.
vialpando
alleges
that
colorado
can
only
accommodate
this
requirement
of
the
statute
by
itemizing
all
expenses
and
there’s
no
other
way
to
do
it.
as
i
mentioned
previously
in
rosado,
the
court
did
allow
the
use
of
standard
--
standardizing
and
averaging
as
long
as
the
items
in
the
average
were
fairly
priced.
the
court
has
also
held
in
the
welfare
areas
and
recently
in
the
dablino
case
that
the
federal
law
is
to
be
looked
at
carefully
and
if
there
is
not
a
specific
statutory
requirement
or
if
there
is
not
a
condition
of
eligibility
being
added
by
the
state
that
the
states
do
have
discretion
in
this
difficult
area
in
the
--
the
courts
are
--
the
lower
courts
have
been
cautioned
by
this
court
to
not
get
into
the
are
of
--
determine
what
might
be
in
its
opinion
the
best
way
to
--
to
administer
the
welfare
program.
colorado’s
position
is
that
this
--
this
afdc
statute
is
merely
setting
out
of
the
basic
state
plan
requirements.
it
doesn’t
spell
out
of
every
detail,
period
and
comma
to
have
a
program
which
complies
with
the
statute,
that
there
are
other
requirements
in
the
statute
that
have
to
be
accommodated
also.
one
is
that
the
states
must
in
a
prompt
manner
determine
eligibility
and
provide
benefits
to
those
who
are
eligible.
the
determination
of
employment
expenses
only
on
an
item
by
item
basis
would
have
to
be
done
every
month
for
every
welfare
recipient
not
only
to
determine
eligibility,
but
to
determine
the
amount
of
assistance
and
the
cost
of
administering
this
type
of
a
determination
would
take
a
lot
of
money
from
the
actual
benefits
going
to
the
welfare
recipient
and
use
it
up
for
administrative
expenses.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
hew
requires
that
the
states
must
promptly
determine
eligibility
for
assistance
and
the
amount
of
assistance.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
no
your
honor.
their
position
as
stated
in
the
solicitor
general’s
amicus
brief
is
that
averaging
in
standard
employment
allowances
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
the
most
recent
letter?
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
pardon?
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes
your
honor,
that’s
correct.
the
solicitor
was
advised
by
the
department
of
health,
education
and
welfare
that
even
back
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
well,
yes
your
honor
it
does.
we’re
saying
that
at
the
time
colorado
implemented
the
standard
employment
allowance,
it
was
permitted
by
hew
and
that
was
their
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
this
letter
even
goes
further
back,
way
back
to
1964.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes,
your
honor,
the
question
before
the
court
is,
does
the
statute
allow
both
hew
and
the
state
to
standardize
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
which
is
when
this
language
in
the
statute
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes,
she
had
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes,
your
honor.
that’s
exactly
correct
so
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
any
means
any
and
any
would
mean
all
and
the
language
we
think
is
most
important
is
the
first
part,
it
says
the
state
in
determining
need
and
in
determining
the
need,
the
state
has
always
had
large
discretion
as
to
how
they
do
this,
shall
take
into
consideration
and
take
into
consideration
does
not
mean
shall
deduct
all
because
if
the
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
well,
i
would
question
that
type
of
an
allowance
because
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
--
in
that
case
you’re
not
reviewing
full
consideration
to
the
actual
expenses,
you
only
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
you
--
it
could
be
argued
that
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
well,
it
depends
how
the
state
is
required
by
the
statute
to
take
into
consideration
expenses.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
and
the
following
section
of
the
statute
after
the
one
that
we’re
concerned
with
talks
about
“and
the
state
shall
disregard
certain
income.”
now,
if
congress
had
intended
the
state
must
deduct
all
employment
expenses,
they
could
have
very
easily,
put
this
provision
on
deducting
employment
expenses
down
in
the
next
section
which
really
says
disregard
which
means
deduct
to
me.
the
language
is
a
lot
different
“take
into
consideration
and
deduct”
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
no,
your
honor.
it’s
a
strictly
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
it
does
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
well,
your
honor,
i
think
pendent
jurisdiction
would
have
allowed
the
--
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
no,
your
honor,
i
think
it
would
have
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes,
it
did.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
page
14th.
mr.
douglas
d.
doane
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
--
if
the
court
is
interested
in
that
area,
the
–
it
would
appear
then
at
the
federal
statute
does
provide
the
state
of
colorado,
the
option
as
to
what
method
to
select
in
determining
and
considering
what
expenses
are
reasonably
attributable
and
that
the
lower
court’s
determinations
that
there
was
no
such
discretion
that
there
only
was
one
way
to
meet
the
requirement
of
the
statute
gave
no
effect
to
the
words
“reasonably
attributable”
that
the
lower
court
should
be
reversed.
