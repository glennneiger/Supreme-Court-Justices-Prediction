mr.
tom
w.
armour
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
we’re
concerned
with
a
particular
section
of
social
security
act
of
1935,
in
particular
section
402
(a)
(7)
and
it's
the
respondent’s
position
that
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
consistent
with
this
section
402
(a)
(7),
the
state
of
colorado
may
refuse
to
take
into
consideration
expenses
of
employment
which
are
reasonably
attributable
to
the
earning
of
that
employment,
but
in
excess
of
the
flat,
$30.00
per
month
allowance.
the
controlling
statute,
your
honors,
require
states
which
participate
in
the
afdc
program
to
disregard
any
expense
reasonably
attributable
to
their
earning
of
income.
the
colorado
regulation
permits
the
disregard
of
$30.00
per
month
in
addition
to
child
care
expenses
and
mandatory
payroll
deductions.
we
believe
it
is
also
important
to
state
what
this
case
is
not
about.
the
respondent
is
not
arguing
that
colorado
must
allow
unreasonable
work
expenses.
in
fact,
it
is
our
position
that
the
states
have
a
duty
to
inquire
into
the
reasonableness
of
work
expenses
both
as
to
amount
and
as
to
whether
or
not
they're
necessary
for
employment.
there
cannot
be
a
tenuous
relationship
between
the
particular
work
expense
in
the
particular
job.
the
state
of
colorado
made
that
inquiry
prior
to
july
1,
1970
and
determined
that
in
this
ascension
be
upon
those
case
that
she
had
reasonable
work
expenses
in
the
amount
of
$126.11
per
month.
that
has
never
been
an
issue.
but
however,
after
july
of
1970,
the
state
of
colorado
disregarded
the
flat,
$30.00
per
month.
and
because
the
state
of
colorado
failed
to
take
into
consideration
$96.11
per
month,
mrs.
vialpando
finding
it
difficult
to
meet
in
--
make
ends
meet
left
the
job
market.
so
therefore,
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
section
402
(a)
(7)
permits
states
to
use
flat
amounts
based
on
statistical
averages
to
determine
work
expenses
when
the
individual’s
work
expenses
exceed
that
flat
amount
and
we
think
that
properly
this
analysis
begins
first
by
looking
to
the
text
of
the
statute
and
trying
to
determine
its
plain
meaning.
and
that
statute
says,
“that
a
state
plan
must,
except
as
maybe
otherwise
provided
in
clause
8,
provide
that
the
state
agency
shall
in
determining
need
take
into
consideration
any
other
income
and
resources
of
any
child
or
relative
as
well
as
any
expenses
reasonably
attributable
to
the
earning
of
that
income.”
first
of
all,
the
word
“shall”
is
used.
it
mandates
the
state
agency
to
look
at
both
income
and
expenses
of
the
recipient.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes,
your
honor
and
it
is
our
position
that
they
did
not
look
fully
at
those
work
expenses
and
they
failed
to
disregard
reasonable
work
expenses
in
a
--
that
were
reasonably
attributable
to
the
earning
of
income.
it
is
not
our
position
that
they
may
simply
look
at
or
take
into
consideration
an
average
of
work
expenses.
they
must
disregard
any
expense
as
long
as
it’s
reasonably
attributable
to
the
earning
of
income.
the
statute
in
fact
requires
them
to
determine
need
--
to
determine
need
in
the
individual
case.
that’s
--
mr.
tom
w.
armour
well,
your
honor,
judge
rouse
in
the
trial
court
asked
whether
it
made
any
sense
to
allow
$30.00
per
month
to
recipients
who
in
fact
had
no
expenses
or
less
than
that.
but
as
far
as
administrative
efficiency
is
concerned,
we
would
agree
that
the
use
of
the
flat
amount
for
all
recipients
based
on
a
fair
average,
together
with
the
right
of
individual
recipients
to
demonstrate
an
entitlement
of
greater
reasonable
work
expenses
would
both
meet
the
goals
of
administrative
efficiency
and
stay
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
well,
your
honor,
this
question
of
administrative
efficiency
has
never
been
actually
litigated
in
the
courts
below.
it
is
just
been
alluded
to.
we’re
not
quite
sure
how
much
administrative
efficiency,
if
any,
would
be
generated
by
the
use
of
a
flat
amount.
i
don’t
believe
the
state
of
colorado
could
use
the
figure
$10.00
per
month
because
as
mr.
justice
stewart
mentioned,
three
years
ago,
in
the
state
of
colorado,
average
work
expenses
were
close
to
$37.00
per
month.
we
would
maintain
and
--
expenses
have
gone
up
since
that
time
so
we
wouldn’t
want
to
accept
the
use
of
the
$10.00
per
month.
but
as
to
the
use
the
flat
amount
together
with
the
right
to
demonstrate
an
entitlement
to
a
greater
amount,
we
would
--
we
would
accept
your
honor.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
your
honor,
i
think
the
state
of
colorado
by
its
participation
in
the
afdc
program
has
to
follow
these
--
this
statute,
(a)
(7)
and
that
statute
requires
both
the
recipient
to
demonstrate
an
entitlement
to
each
and
every
expense
and
also
the
state
of
colorado
to
disregard
each
and
every
expense
as
long
as
its
reasonably
attributable
with
their
earning
of
income,
yes.
the
words
of
the
statute
taken
into
consideration
perhaps
in
and
of
themselves
are
flexible
as
the
tenth
circuit
indicated,
but
when
you
look
at
this
particular
statute
and
its
entirety,
it
takes
no
a
particular
meaning.
first
of
all,
take
into
consideration
modifies
the
words
“any
other
income
and
resources.”
the
word
“any”
is
used
to
introduce
income
and
resources.
the
state
of
colorado
and
the
secretary
of
hew
certainly
don’t
put
forth
any
averaging
argument
or
outside
sources
of
income.
the
state
wants
to
take
into
consideration
every
cent
of
outside
income
and
they
properly
should.
adc
is
to
be
given
to
needy
children
and
naturally
the
state
should
take
into
consideration
any
outside
source
of
income.
you
can’t
average
child
support
payments.
you
certainly
can’t
average
the
earnings
of
all
employed
recipients
in
the
state
of
colorado.
you’ve
got
to
take
a
look
at
each
individual’s
outside
income.
now,
this
statute
goes
on
and
adds
a
expense
section
and
it's
introduced
by
the
words
“as
well
as.”
we
think
its
reasonable
to
conclude
that
congress
intended
work
expenses
to
be
treated
in
the
same
manner
and
that’s
why
they
used
this
phrase
“as
well
as.”
and
this
language
requires
any
expenses
to
be
disregarded,
not
sum,
not
an
average
but
any.
section
402,
the
social
security
act
in
sub-section
(a)
(8),
your
honors,
uses
the
word
“other
than
any”
when
talking
about
the
state’s
option
to
set
aside
earned
income
for
the
future
needs
of
the
child.
in
the
--
in
that
part
of
the
statute,
congress
has
said
that
states
may
permit
any
or
excuse
me,
all
or
any
portion
of
the
earned
income
to
be
set
aside.
i
think
this
demonstrates
that
congress
knows
how
to
use
specific
language
and
allows
states
to
disregard
something
less
than
a
100%
and
that
part
of
the
statute
they
use
the
words
“any,
all
or
any
portion.”
in
our
section
of
the
statute,
they
used
the
word
“any”.
in
addition
to
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
which
we
think
supports
the
respondent’s
position,
we
also
think
that
the
legislative
history
supports
us
as
well.
prior
to
1962
when
this
part
of
the
statute
was
added,
it
was
optional
for
states
to
disregard
work
expenses,
but
the
senate
finance
committee
in
reporting
out
the
bill
which
amended
402
(a)
(7)
stated
that
it
believed
that
only
reasonable
for
the
states
to
take
these
expenses
fully
into
account.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
your
honor,
we
believe
that
our
position
is
supported
by
decisions
--
mr.
tom
w.
armour
no,
there’s
a
decision
in
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
connecticut
state
department
versus
hew
which
we
believes
supports
our
position.
the
decision
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
on
december
23,
1973
the
eight
circuit
in
anderson
versus
graham
took
the
position
that
any
expenses
requires
states
to
disregard
all
actual
expenses.
so
we
believe
that
there
are
three
circuit
opinions
in
the
point,
your
honor.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
your
honor,
i
believe
anderson
versus
graham
is
set
out
in
appendix
e
to
the
respondent’s
brief.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
alluded
in
petitioner’s
argument
to
a
letter
submitted
yesterday
by
the
solicitor
general.
respondents
would
like
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
that
letter
in
writing
briefly,
if
we
may.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
well,
your
honor
we
have
not
carefully
analyzed
the
contents
of
this
letter,
but
we
do
agree
that
apparently
the
secretary
of
hew
is
now
taking
a
position
that
they
didn’t
take
on
october
4
when
they
filed
their
original
brief.
the
letter
goes
to
sections
31,
40
of
the
handbook
and
we
simply
think
that
they’ve
misstated
the
secretary’s
position.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
your
honor,
may
i
first
answer
the
question
by
saying
that
petitioners
correctly
stated
that
this
issue
was
not
argued
at
any
point.
judge
rouse
simply
--
mr.
tom
w.
armour
well,
your
honor,
our
complaint
was
filed
under
section
--
title
42,
section
1983
and
the
jurisdictional
sections
that
we
relied
upon
were
28
united
states
code,
section
1343.
we
believe
there
is
a
subs
--
or
there
was
at
the
time
and
still
remains
a
substantial
constitutional
question
and
that
the
court
had
pendent
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
statutory
issue
and
properly
should
have
gone
to
the
statutory
issue
first.
but
we
don’t
think
that
there
is
a
rational
class
--
justification
for
steps
in
two
classes
of
--
well,
working
welfare
recipients
those
with
less
than
$30.00
per
month
in
expenses
and
those
with
more
than
$30.00
in
expenses.
i
think
we
could've
established
clearly
jurisdiction
in
the
trial
court
and
i
properly
agree
that
the
courts
below
have
also
because
they’ve
been
able
to
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
statutory
issue,
not
going
to
the
constitutional
--
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
i
--
your
honor,
at
the
time
this
action
was
commenced,
there
was
a
different
counsel
arguing
the
case,
but
to
my
best
knowledge,
the
constitutional
issue
was
presented
and
we
did
in
fact
want
to
argue
it.
it
was
judge
rouse
just
simply
took
the
statutory
issue,
but
yes
your
honor,
we
did
fully
intend
to
argue
that
point.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
your
honor,
the
first
--
it
was
done
orally.
the
first
time
the
briefs
that
were
filed
were
in
support
of
motions
for
summary
judgment
which
was
considerably
after
the
time
of
filing
the
action,
almost
a
year.
so
it
was
not
urged
in
actual
brief
writing,
but
it
was
urged
orally
before
the
court.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes
your
honor,
certainly
is,
but
we
think
there
is
a
substantial
constitutional
issue
and
that
this
court
i
believe
in
rosado
versus
wyman
which
has
been
cited
for
other
purposes
before
by
petitioners
states
that
this
court
does
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
statutory
issues
raised
along
with
claims
with
constitutional
violation.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
to
the
district
court
your
honor.
not
--
mr.
tom
w.
armour
no,
not
a
motion
that
was
either
filed
or
argued.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
at
the
time
that
plaintiff
went
to
u.s.
district
court
in
denver
to
see
contemporary
restrain
order
enjoining
enforcement
of
the
regulation.
that
restrain
order
was
not
granted
with
the
--
i
believe
your
honor
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
was
brought
up
at
that
time.
there
was
a
hearing
on
a
motion
for
a
temporary
--
for
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
no.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
the
appendix
your
honor
--
mr.
tom
w.
armour
well,
your
honor,
we
certainly
i
think
we
have
substantial
statutory
provision,
one
that
can
be
--
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes,
but
in
addition
i
mean
i
think
it
can
be
well
--
well
recognized
that
it
whether
--
you
have
two
classifications
of
working
(inaudible)
recipients,
one
with
less
than
$30.00
per
month
work
expenses
and
another
with
more
than
$30.00
per
month
work
expenses.
i
don’t
see
the
reasonable
class
--
you
know,
that
understand
that
classification
and
i
think
we
could
sustain,
in
fact
have
sustained
the
burden
of
presenting
a
cargo
constitutional
issue.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
your
honor,
it
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
u.s.
district
court
judge
at
the
time
there
was
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
injunctive
relief
should
be
granted.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
no,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
does
not.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
the
first
memorandum
opinion
i
believe
of
the
u.s.
district
court.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
no,
your
honor,
they
were
not.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes.
and
she
--
and
judge
rouse
was
the
chief
justice
of
the
district
(voice
overlap).
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
i
think
your
honor
that
clearly
implies
that
he
felt
that
was
a
question
(voice
overlap).
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
well,
your
honor
we
think,
we
certainly
have
a
non-frivolous
constitutional
claim
as
well
as
a
statutory
argument
that
that
holds
up
under
close
analysis.
the
use
of
averaging,
we
don’t
believe
is
permitted
either
by
the
statutory
language
or
the
legislative
history,
apart
from
the
secretary’s
novel
argument
about
the
a
(inaudible),
the
only
other
argument
they
had
in
essence
was
at
this
court
in
rosado
versus
wyman,
sanctioned
the
use
of
averaging.
we
don’t
believe
that
rosado
stands
for
a
blanket
approval
of
averaging
without
taking
a
look
at
the
particular
case
and
we
think
that
this
action
can
be
distinguished.
this
court
in
rosado
had
--
that
section
402
(a)
(23)
had
been
violated
by
the
state
of
new
york
in
its
conversion
from
a
system
of
special
need
grants
to
a
system
of
flat
grants.
however,
the
court
did
say
that
in
determining
standard
of
need,
the
states
could
use
a
fair
averaging
process,
but
this
court
in
rosado
was
concerned
with
section
(a)
(23)
not
(a)
(7).
there
is
nothing
in
(a)
(23)
that
requires
states
to
meet
all
needs
just
to
make
cost
of
living
adjustments
periodically.
in
contrast,
(a)
(7)
requires
specifically
that
any
expenses
be
disregarded
as
petitioner's
correctly
stated,
the
states
have
traditionally
had
great
flexibility
in
determining
standards
of
need.
this
court
in
king
versus
smith,
397
--
392
u.s.
made
that
very
clear.
but
we’re
not
talking
about
a
hypothetical
standard
in
meeting
this
particular
case,
we’re
talking
about
mrs.
vialpando’s
actual
work
expenses.
and
even
in
the
rosado,
i
believe
that
this
court
stated
that
this
lauded
goal
of
administrative
efficiency
may
not
be
furthered
in
such
a
way
to
violate
a
specific
statutory
command.
so,
this
--
for
this
reason
we
do
not
believe
that
rosado
was
in
point
or
sanctions
the
use
of
averaging
in
determining
work
expenses.
in
fact,
what
we
believe
that
the
state
of
colorado
has
done
with
the
secretary’s
approval
as
cut
into
the
incentive
that
congress
intended
for
welfare
recipients
to
go
back
into
the
job
market
and
maybe
--
may
well
be
that
what
congress
did
in
1962
is
wrong.
we
don’t
think
so.
however,
the
secretary
of
hew
is
actually
convinced
that
administrative
efficiency
is
a
more
important
policy
than
encouraging
self-support
in
helping
parents
of
needy
children
and
relatives
claiming
aid
to
attain
or
retain
the
maximum
capability
for
self-sufficiency,
then
this
argument
should
properly
be
addressed
to
the
congress
of
united
states.
there
have
been
a
number
of
proposals
since
1962
before
the
congress
to
combine
the
work
expense
disregard,
found
in
(a)
(7)
with
their
earned
income
exemption
found
in
(a)
(8).
however
today,
congress
has
rejected
those
arguments,
but
that
is
a
proper
forum,
that
the
secretary
of
hew
to
take
its
argument.
we
firmly
believe
that
congress
intended
by
the
enactment
of
(a)
(7)
to
give
recipients
of
powerful
and
a
meaningful
incentive
to
go
back
into
the
job
market.
mrs.
vialpando
was
tried
on
a
three
occasions
to
return
to
work.
parents
and
needy
children
need
to
be
able
to
break
their
cycle
of
poverty
and
one
way
to
do
this
your
honors
is
to
disregard
all
their
reasonable
work
expenses
and
for
those
reasons
we
respectably
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeal
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
this
case
we’re
concerned
with
a
particular
section
of
social
security
act
of
1935,
in
particular
section
402
(a)
(7)
and
it's
the
respondent’s
position
that
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
consistent
with
this
section
402
(a)
(7),
the
state
of
colorado
may
refuse
to
take
into
consideration
expenses
of
employment
which
are
reasonably
attributable
to
the
earning
of
that
employment,
but
in
excess
of
the
flat,
$30.00
per
month
allowance.
the
controlling
statute,
your
honors,
require
states
which
participate
in
the
afdc
program
to
disregard
any
expense
reasonably
attributable
to
their
earning
of
income.
the
colorado
regulation
permits
the
disregard
of
$30.00
per
month
in
addition
to
child
care
expenses
and
mandatory
payroll
deductions.
we
believe
it
is
also
important
to
state
what
this
case
is
not
about.
the
respondent
is
not
arguing
that
colorado
must
allow
unreasonable
work
expenses.
in
fact,
it
is
our
position
that
the
states
have
a
duty
to
inquire
into
the
reasonableness
of
work
expenses
both
as
to
amount
and
as
to
whether
or
not
they're
necessary
for
employment.
there
cannot
be
a
tenuous
relationship
between
the
particular
work
expense
in
the
particular
job.
the
state
of
colorado
made
that
inquiry
prior
to
july
1,
1970
and
determined
that
in
this
ascension
be
upon
those
case
that
she
had
reasonable
work
expenses
in
the
amount
of
$126.11
per
month.
that
has
never
been
an
issue.
but
however,
after
july
of
1970,
the
state
of
colorado
disregarded
the
flat,
$30.00
per
month.
and
because
the
state
of
colorado
failed
to
take
into
consideration
$96.11
per
month,
mrs.
vialpando
finding
it
difficult
to
meet
in
--
make
ends
meet
left
the
job
market.
so
therefore,
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
section
402
(a)
(7)
permits
states
to
use
flat
amounts
based
on
statistical
averages
to
determine
work
expenses
when
the
individual’s
work
expenses
exceed
that
flat
amount
and
we
think
that
properly
this
analysis
begins
first
by
looking
to
the
text
of
the
statute
and
trying
to
determine
its
plain
meaning.
and
that
statute
says,
“that
a
state
plan
must,
except
as
maybe
otherwise
provided
in
clause
8,
provide
that
the
state
agency
shall
in
determining
need
take
into
consideration
any
other
income
and
resources
of
any
child
or
relative
as
well
as
any
expenses
reasonably
attributable
to
the
earning
of
that
income.”
first
of
all,
the
word
“shall”
is
used.
it
mandates
the
state
agency
to
look
at
both
income
and
expenses
of
the
recipient.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes,
your
honor
and
it
is
our
position
that
they
did
not
look
fully
at
those
work
expenses
and
they
failed
to
disregard
reasonable
work
expenses
in
a
--
that
were
reasonably
attributable
to
the
earning
of
income.
it
is
not
our
position
that
they
may
simply
look
at
or
take
into
consideration
an
average
of
work
expenses.
they
must
disregard
any
expense
as
long
as
it’s
reasonably
attributable
to
the
earning
of
income.
the
statute
in
fact
requires
them
to
determine
need
--
to
determine
need
in
the
individual
case.
that’s
--
mr.
tom
w.
armour
well,
your
honor,
judge
rouse
in
the
trial
court
asked
whether
it
made
any
sense
to
allow
$30.00
per
month
to
recipients
who
in
fact
had
no
expenses
or
less
than
that.
but
as
far
as
administrative
efficiency
is
concerned,
we
would
agree
that
the
use
of
the
flat
amount
for
all
recipients
based
on
a
fair
average,
together
with
the
right
of
individual
recipients
to
demonstrate
an
entitlement
of
greater
reasonable
work
expenses
would
both
meet
the
goals
of
administrative
efficiency
and
stay
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
well,
your
honor,
this
question
of
administrative
efficiency
has
never
been
actually
litigated
in
the
courts
below.
it
is
just
been
alluded
to.
we’re
not
quite
sure
how
much
administrative
efficiency,
if
any,
would
be
generated
by
the
use
of
a
flat
amount.
i
don’t
believe
the
state
of
colorado
could
use
the
figure
$10.00
per
month
because
as
mr.
justice
stewart
mentioned,
three
years
ago,
in
the
state
of
colorado,
average
work
expenses
were
close
to
$37.00
per
month.
we
would
maintain
and
--
expenses
have
gone
up
since
that
time
so
we
wouldn’t
want
to
accept
the
use
of
the
$10.00
per
month.
but
as
to
the
use
the
flat
amount
together
with
the
right
to
demonstrate
an
entitlement
to
a
greater
amount,
we
would
--
we
would
accept
your
honor.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
your
honor,
i
think
the
state
of
colorado
by
its
participation
in
the
afdc
program
has
to
follow
these
--
this
statute,
(a)
(7)
and
that
statute
requires
both
the
recipient
to
demonstrate
an
entitlement
to
each
and
every
expense
and
also
the
state
of
colorado
to
disregard
each
and
every
expense
as
long
as
its
reasonably
attributable
with
their
earning
of
income,
yes.
the
words
of
the
statute
taken
into
consideration
perhaps
in
and
of
themselves
are
flexible
as
the
tenth
circuit
indicated,
but
when
you
look
at
this
particular
statute
and
its
entirety,
it
takes
no
a
particular
meaning.
first
of
all,
take
into
consideration
modifies
the
words
“any
other
income
and
resources.”
the
word
“any”
is
used
to
introduce
income
and
resources.
the
state
of
colorado
and
the
secretary
of
hew
certainly
don’t
put
forth
any
averaging
argument
or
outside
sources
of
income.
the
state
wants
to
take
into
consideration
every
cent
of
outside
income
and
they
properly
should.
adc
is
to
be
given
to
needy
children
and
naturally
the
state
should
take
into
consideration
any
outside
source
of
income.
you
can’t
average
child
support
payments.
you
certainly
can’t
average
the
earnings
of
all
employed
recipients
in
the
state
of
colorado.
you’ve
got
to
take
a
look
at
each
individual’s
outside
income.
now,
this
statute
goes
on
and
adds
a
expense
section
and
it's
introduced
by
the
words
“as
well
as.”
we
think
its
reasonable
to
conclude
that
congress
intended
work
expenses
to
be
treated
in
the
same
manner
and
that’s
why
they
used
this
phrase
“as
well
as.”
and
this
language
requires
any
expenses
to
be
disregarded,
not
sum,
not
an
average
but
any.
section
402,
the
social
security
act
in
sub-section
(a)
(8),
your
honors,
uses
the
word
“other
than
any”
when
talking
about
the
state’s
option
to
set
aside
earned
income
for
the
future
needs
of
the
child.
in
the
--
in
that
part
of
the
statute,
congress
has
said
that
states
may
permit
any
or
excuse
me,
all
or
any
portion
of
the
earned
income
to
be
set
aside.
i
think
this
demonstrates
that
congress
knows
how
to
use
specific
language
and
allows
states
to
disregard
something
less
than
a
100%
and
that
part
of
the
statute
they
use
the
words
“any,
all
or
any
portion.”
in
our
section
of
the
statute,
they
used
the
word
“any”.
in
addition
to
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
which
we
think
supports
the
respondent’s
position,
we
also
think
that
the
legislative
history
supports
us
as
well.
prior
to
1962
when
this
part
of
the
statute
was
added,
it
was
optional
for
states
to
disregard
work
expenses,
but
the
senate
finance
committee
in
reporting
out
the
bill
which
amended
402
(a)
(7)
stated
that
it
believed
that
only
reasonable
for
the
states
to
take
these
expenses
fully
into
account.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
your
honor,
we
believe
that
our
position
is
supported
by
decisions
--
mr.
tom
w.
armour
no,
there’s
a
decision
in
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
connecticut
state
department
versus
hew
which
we
believes
supports
our
position.
the
decision
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
on
december
23,
1973
the
eight
circuit
in
anderson
versus
graham
took
the
position
that
any
expenses
requires
states
to
disregard
all
actual
expenses.
so
we
believe
that
there
are
three
circuit
opinions
in
the
point,
your
honor.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
your
honor,
i
believe
anderson
versus
graham
is
set
out
in
appendix
e
to
the
respondent’s
brief.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes.
mr.
justice
stewart
has
alluded
in
petitioner’s
argument
to
a
letter
submitted
yesterday
by
the
solicitor
general.
respondents
would
like
the
opportunity
to
respond
to
that
letter
in
writing
briefly,
if
we
may.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
well,
your
honor
we
have
not
carefully
analyzed
the
contents
of
this
letter,
but
we
do
agree
that
apparently
the
secretary
of
hew
is
now
taking
a
position
that
they
didn’t
take
on
october
4
when
they
filed
their
original
brief.
the
letter
goes
to
sections
31,
40
of
the
handbook
and
we
simply
think
that
they’ve
misstated
the
secretary’s
position.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
your
honor,
may
i
first
answer
the
question
by
saying
that
petitioners
correctly
stated
that
this
issue
was
not
argued
at
any
point.
judge
rouse
simply
--
mr.
tom
w.
armour
well,
your
honor,
our
complaint
was
filed
under
section
--
title
42,
section
1983
and
the
jurisdictional
sections
that
we
relied
upon
were
28
united
states
code,
section
1343.
we
believe
there
is
a
subs
--
or
there
was
at
the
time
and
still
remains
a
substantial
constitutional
question
and
that
the
court
had
pendent
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
statutory
issue
and
properly
should
have
gone
to
the
statutory
issue
first.
but
we
don’t
think
that
there
is
a
rational
class
--
justification
for
steps
in
two
classes
of
--
well,
working
welfare
recipients
those
with
less
than
$30.00
per
month
in
expenses
and
those
with
more
than
$30.00
in
expenses.
i
think
we
could've
established
clearly
jurisdiction
in
the
trial
court
and
i
properly
agree
that
the
courts
below
have
also
because
they’ve
been
able
to
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
the
statutory
issue,
not
going
to
the
constitutional
--
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
i
--
your
honor,
at
the
time
this
action
was
commenced,
there
was
a
different
counsel
arguing
the
case,
but
to
my
best
knowledge,
the
constitutional
issue
was
presented
and
we
did
in
fact
want
to
argue
it.
it
was
judge
rouse
just
simply
took
the
statutory
issue,
but
yes
your
honor,
we
did
fully
intend
to
argue
that
point.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
your
honor,
the
first
--
it
was
done
orally.
the
first
time
the
briefs
that
were
filed
were
in
support
of
motions
for
summary
judgment
which
was
considerably
after
the
time
of
filing
the
action,
almost
a
year.
so
it
was
not
urged
in
actual
brief
writing,
but
it
was
urged
orally
before
the
court.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes
your
honor,
certainly
is,
but
we
think
there
is
a
substantial
constitutional
issue
and
that
this
court
i
believe
in
rosado
versus
wyman
which
has
been
cited
for
other
purposes
before
by
petitioners
states
that
this
court
does
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
statutory
issues
raised
along
with
claims
with
constitutional
violation.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
to
the
district
court
your
honor.
not
--
mr.
tom
w.
armour
no,
not
a
motion
that
was
either
filed
or
argued.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
at
the
time
that
plaintiff
went
to
u.s.
district
court
in
denver
to
see
contemporary
restrain
order
enjoining
enforcement
of
the
regulation.
that
restrain
order
was
not
granted
with
the
--
i
believe
your
honor
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
was
brought
up
at
that
time.
there
was
a
hearing
on
a
motion
for
a
temporary
--
for
preliminary
injunction.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
no.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
the
appendix
your
honor
--
mr.
tom
w.
armour
well,
your
honor,
we
certainly
i
think
we
have
substantial
statutory
provision,
one
that
can
be
--
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes,
but
in
addition
i
mean
i
think
it
can
be
well
--
well
recognized
that
it
whether
--
you
have
two
classifications
of
working
(inaudible)
recipients,
one
with
less
than
$30.00
per
month
work
expenses
and
another
with
more
than
$30.00
per
month
work
expenses.
i
don’t
see
the
reasonable
class
--
you
know,
that
understand
that
classification
and
i
think
we
could
sustain,
in
fact
have
sustained
the
burden
of
presenting
a
cargo
constitutional
issue.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
your
honor,
it
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
u.s.
district
court
judge
at
the
time
there
was
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
injunctive
relief
should
be
granted.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
no,
your
honor,
i
believe
it
does
not.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
the
first
memorandum
opinion
i
believe
of
the
u.s.
district
court.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
no,
your
honor,
they
were
not.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes.
and
she
--
and
judge
rouse
was
the
chief
justice
of
the
district
(voice
overlap).
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
i
think
your
honor
that
clearly
implies
that
he
felt
that
was
a
question
(voice
overlap).
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
tom
w.
armour
well,
your
honor
we
think,
we
certainly
have
a
non-frivolous
constitutional
claim
as
well
as
a
statutory
argument
that
that
holds
up
under
close
analysis.
the
use
of
averaging,
we
don’t
believe
is
permitted
either
by
the
statutory
language
or
the
legislative
history,
apart
from
the
secretary’s
novel
argument
about
the
a
(inaudible),
the
only
other
argument
they
had
in
essence
was
at
this
court
in
rosado
versus
wyman,
sanctioned
the
use
of
averaging.
we
don’t
believe
that
rosado
stands
for
a
blanket
approval
of
averaging
without
taking
a
look
at
the
particular
case
and
we
think
that
this
action
can
be
distinguished.
this
court
in
rosado
had
--
that
section
402
(a)
(23)
had
been
violated
by
the
state
of
new
york
in
its
conversion
from
a
system
of
special
need
grants
to
a
system
of
flat
grants.
however,
the
court
did
say
that
in
determining
standard
of
need,
the
states
could
use
a
fair
averaging
process,
but
this
court
in
rosado
was
concerned
with
section
(a)
(23)
not
(a)
(7).
there
is
nothing
in
(a)
(23)
that
requires
states
to
meet
all
needs
just
to
make
cost
of
living
adjustments
periodically.
in
contrast,
(a)
(7)
requires
specifically
that
any
expenses
be
disregarded
as
petitioner's
correctly
stated,
the
states
have
traditionally
had
great
flexibility
in
determining
standards
of
need.
this
court
in
king
versus
smith,
397
--
392
u.s.
made
that
very
clear.
but
we’re
not
talking
about
a
hypothetical
standard
in
meeting
this
particular
case,
we’re
talking
about
mrs.
vialpando’s
actual
work
expenses.
and
even
in
the
rosado,
i
believe
that
this
court
stated
that
this
lauded
goal
of
administrative
efficiency
may
not
be
furthered
in
such
a
way
to
violate
a
specific
statutory
command.
so,
this
--
for
this
reason
we
do
not
believe
that
rosado
was
in
point
or
sanctions
the
use
of
averaging
in
determining
work
expenses.
in
fact,
what
we
believe
that
the
state
of
colorado
has
done
with
the
secretary’s
approval
as
cut
into
the
incentive
that
congress
intended
for
welfare
recipients
to
go
back
into
the
job
market
and
maybe
--
may
well
be
that
what
congress
did
in
1962
is
wrong.
we
don’t
think
so.
however,
the
secretary
of
hew
is
actually
convinced
that
administrative
efficiency
is
a
more
important
policy
than
encouraging
self-support
in
helping
parents
of
needy
children
and
relatives
claiming
aid
to
attain
or
retain
the
maximum
capability
for
self-sufficiency,
then
this
argument
should
properly
be
addressed
to
the
congress
of
united
states.
there
have
been
a
number
of
proposals
since
1962
before
the
congress
to
combine
the
work
expense
disregard,
found
in
(a)
(7)
with
their
earned
income
exemption
found
in
(a)
(8).
however
today,
congress
has
rejected
those
arguments,
but
that
is
a
proper
forum,
that
the
secretary
of
hew
to
take
its
argument.
we
firmly
believe
that
congress
intended
by
the
enactment
of
(a)
(7)
to
give
recipients
of
powerful
and
a
meaningful
incentive
to
go
back
into
the
job
market.
mrs.
vialpando
was
tried
on
a
three
occasions
to
return
to
work.
parents
and
needy
children
need
to
be
able
to
break
their
cycle
of
poverty
and
one
way
to
do
this
your
honors
is
to
disregard
all
their
reasonable
work
expenses
and
for
those
reasons
we
respectably
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeal
should
be
affirmed.
