i
am
having
trouble
understanding
that
as
matter
of
arithmetic
as
they
ranged
from
$32.00
to
$36.00,
why
is
the
average
is
$30.00?
justice
potter
stewart
i
know
that
--
i
know
that
then
that’s
the
basic
question
of
course
in
this
case.
i
was
just
wondering
why
an
average
of
--
a
low
of
$32.00
and
i
have
$36.00
turns
out
to
be
$30.00
in
colorado
because
where
went
to
school
it
doesn’t?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
don’t
see
how
anybody
could
come
out
ahead
on
this
apparently?
it
ranges
from
$32.00
to
$36.00,
how
does
anybody
gain
when
he
gets
$30.00?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
some
people
have
no
expenses?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
it
those
who
do
have
expenses,
their
expenses
range
from
$32.00
to
$36.00,
is
that
--?
justice
potter
stewart
what
page
are
you
on?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
that
did
prevent
the
use
of
it.
has
there
have
been
any
change
since
this
case
was
--
begun,
is
there
been
any
increase
in
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that's
been
allowed?
justice
potter
stewart
so
they
remain
same
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i’ve
already
interrupted
you,
i
presume
you
have
a
copy
of
the
solicitor
general’s
letter,
february
25th
addressed
to
the
clerk
in
the
court?
justice
potter
stewart
it
takes
a
different
position,
but
it
makes
that
even
stronger
than
its
brief.
his
brief
indicated
and
back
--
that
back
in
1964,
the
secretary
took
the
position
that
you
had
to
allow
actual
expenses
when
they
exceeded
the
lump
sum
and
it
now
tells
us
that
in
--
they’ve
determined
that
in
1964
that
was
not
the
practice.
that’s
the
way
i’ve
read
this
letter.
justice
potter
stewart
that
december
23
decision,
it’s
in
your
briefs
anyway?
justice
potter
stewart
thank
you.
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
jurisdictional
question
as
such
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court
or
to
the
court
of
appeal?
justice
potter
stewart
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
one
of
jurisdiction?
justice
potter
stewart
and
--
so
how
was
it
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
--
i
think
your
fellow
counsel
may
ask
have
help
for
their
--
on
this
question.
justice
potter
stewart
no?
does
the
record
--
does
the
appendix
show
that
question
of
jurisdiction
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court?
justice
potter
stewart
you
answered,
as
i
understand
it
correctly,
that
if
there
is
probably
a
substantial
constitutional
claim,
the
statutory
claim
was
pendent
to
it
and
that
there
is
no
--
can
be
no
question
of
jurisdiction
but
on
the
other
hand
if
the
constitutional
claim
is
frivolous
then
there’s
a
very
great
question
about
whether
there
is
jurisdiction
under
these
jurisdictional
statutes?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know,
but
that’s
not
enough,
--
they're
arguably?
justice
potter
stewart
and
was
that
again,
may
i,
i
am
not
sure,
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
repetitious
but
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
your
answer.
was
this
question
brought
in
any
way
to
the
--
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court
or
court
of
appeals?
justice
potter
stewart
does
the
injunct
--
does
the
appendix
reflect
that
fact
anywhere?
justice
potter
stewart
would
the
other
way
of
doing
it
going
to
the
actual
expenses
also
delay
the
starting
of
welfare?
justice
potter
stewart
according
to
the
solicitor
general’s
letter
of
yesterday
is,
at
least
as
i
read
it,
makes
the
last
paragraph
on
page
2,
he
says,
“furthermore
we
inform
that
no
state
plan
containing
a
standard
working
expense
allowance
has
ever
granted
beneficiaries
the
alternative
of
itemizing.”
so,
if
i
understand
that
language,
he
is
telling
us
that
no
state
has
ever
done
this
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
adopted
the
suggestion
implicit
in
the
chief
justice’s
question.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
either
an
itemization
or
it’s
a
standard
allowance,
none
has
ever
combined
as
i
read
this.

state
has
ever
combined
