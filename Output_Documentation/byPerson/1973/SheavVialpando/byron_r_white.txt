justice
byron

white
and
your
$32.00
to
$36.00
range
was
at
different
times?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
the
range
of
average
–
a
range
of
averages?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
take
it,
your
point
is
that
any
expenses
means
any
expenses,
but
the
question
is
whether
the
statute's
requirement
that
you
take
them
into
consideration
require
that
you
pay
them
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
and
it
does
mean
just
what
it
says.
justice
byron
r.
white
my
point
was,
i
suppose
you
say
under
that
language
you
could
just
say,
we
will
take
into
consideration
and
allow
half
the
expenses
or
10%
or
90%
instead
of
that,
you
say,
we’re
going
to
have
a
standard
deduction.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
--
considering
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
could
put
them
and
certainly
with
the
--
for
people
above
$30.00,
you’re
not
giving
them
full
consideration
in
the
sense
that
you
just
spoke?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
alright.
justice
byron
r.
white
while
i’ve
got
you
interrupted,
could
i
ask
you
a
--
there
was
a
constitutional
claim
in
this
take
case,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
they’re
probably
has
to
be
to
get
into
the
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
make
any
motion
to
dismiss
on
jurisdictional
grounds?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
only
if
the
constitutional
claim
is
--
was
something.
now,
the
judge
rouse
(ph)
just
moved
directly
to
the
statutory
claim,
i
guess.
justice
byron
r.
white
there’s
never
been
any
litigate
--
any
consideration
of
whether
there
is
a
federal
jurisdiction
here?
you
wouldn’t
suggest
there
would
be
a
--
or
would
you
that
there
--
if
there’d
only
been
a
statutory
claim
that
the
--
there'd
would’ve
been
federal
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
--
but
the
--
there
was
no
consideration
given
to
what
--
as
to
whether
it
was
substantial
or
not.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
urge
it
all
to
judge
rouse?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
view
the
purpose
of
your
standard
allowance
rather
than
the
actual?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
hence
the
beginning
of
welfare
payments?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don’t
suppose
the
parties
or
the
judge
can
stipulate
the
jurisdiction?
