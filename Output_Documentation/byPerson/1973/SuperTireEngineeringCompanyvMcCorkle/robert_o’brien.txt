mr.
robert
o’brien
your
honors,
we
represent
the
respondent
teamsters
local
union.
by
leave
of
court,
we
have
been
permitted
to
divide
our
oral
argument
with
the
counsel,
deputy
attorney
general,
who
represents
the
public
officials
in
this
matter.
the
state
has
not
argued
mootness.
we,
however,
have
argued
mootness.
we
would
like
to
make
several
points,
if
we
may,
relative
to
the
record
below.
initially,
your
honor,
we
would
think
that
the
court,
in
reviewing
this
case,
should
have
as
its
starting
point,
the
complaint
which
was
filed
by
super
tire.
if
the
court
examines
the
complaint,
i
think
the
court
can
see
in
effect
that
super
tire
was
complaining
not
about
welfare
benefits
in
general,
but
rather
than
the
granting
of
welfare
benefits
to
the
particular
employees
of
super
tire
during
the
time
that
they
were
on
strike.
and,
i
think
that
is
rather
important
sense
in
effect,
i
think
it
puts
this
particular
lawsuit
into
a
certain
time
frame.
additionally,
your
honor,
at
the
hearing
below,
and
i
think
this
is
important,
judge
kitchen
in
the
district
court
took
no
testimony.
however,
he
did
allow
oral
argument
of
all
counsel
and
it
was
at
that
time
that
we
raised
the
issue
that
this
case,
in
effect,
was
something
that
the
court
should
not
get
into
under
itt
versus
minter.
but
we
also
raise,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it
is
important
and
it
is
in
the
appendix
rather
clearly,
that
we
raise
the
issue
of
mootness.
we
told
the
court
at
that
time
in
the
appendix,
and
i
think
it
is
rather
clear,
that
the
strike
was
over.
that
the
day
before
the
hearing,
june
23rd,
the
employees
voted
to
return
to
work
and
that
the
employees
were
about
to
go
back
to
work
on
the
next
working
day.
and
then,
employer's
counsel
agreed
that
the
strike
had
ended
and
that
the
employees
were
making
preparation
to
go
back
to
work.
so,
in
effect,
what
we
have
is
a
suggestion
of
mootness
not
on
appeal,
but
a
suggestion
on
mootness
at
the
district
court
level.
the
united
states
--
mr.
robert
o’brien
if
your
honor
please,
i
am
going
to
refer
to
my
co-counsel,
the
deputy
attorney
general,
who
will
get
into
the
merits
of
it.
i
would
simply
note
that
you
can
also
take
the
opposite
view
and,
in
effect,
say
that
a
man
who
exercises
his
federal
right
to
strike
in
effect
would
be
discriminated
against
by
the
state
of
new
jersey
denying
him
welfare
benefits
because
the
argument
has
been
raised.
we
would
go
on
to
ask
the
court
to
particularly
examine
the
rather
(inaudible)
opinion
of
judge
adams
below
who
pointed
out
that
there
are,
generally,
different
kinds
of
mootness
criteria
which
have
been
applied.
we
will
take
issue
with
counsel
for
the
petitioner
who
says
that
the
type
of
case
involved
is
what
is
important.
we
think
that
the
particular
criteria
spelled
out
by
judge
adams
below
are
somewhat
criteria
which
have
always
existed
but
which
come
up
with
different
results
depending
on
the
type
of
case.
judge
adams
put
particular
emphasis
upon
oil
workers,
and
we
think
it
was
well-placed.
oil
workers,
in
effect,
concerned
a
labor
dispute
where
the
state
seized
or
the
state
declared
that
a
private
employer
was
a
public
employer
and,
therefore,
the
employees
had
no
right
to
strike.
by
the
time
the
case
got
up
to
this
court,
the
court
said
that
the
labor
dispute
is
over.
there,
we
could
again
say
that
the
court
would
never
really
have
that
kind
of
a
case
before
it
but,
yet,
three
years
later,
the
labor
dispute
continued
in
bus
employees
versus
missouri
and
the
court
did
get
an
opportunity
to
review
the
case.
so,
what
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court
is
that
we
are
not
faced
with
the
situation
where
this
is
continually
evading
review.
there
is
a
case
now
pending
in
the
eastern
district
court
from
michigan
where
the
strike
itself
has
continued
rather
for
two
years.
so,
we
are
not
faced
with
something
which
was
pointed
out
in
icc
versus
southern
pacific
that
is
going
to
continually
evade
review.
rather,
we
think
this
is
something
that
the
court
should
really
decline
to
look
at
and
decline
to
act
upon
under
the
article
3
clause
that
we
got
to
have
a
concrete
case.
mr.
robert
o’brien
well,
i
think
the
employer
has
got
to
be
personally
affected
by
what
is
going
on.
that
he
has
got
to
have
something
harmed
befalling
him,
and
i
do
no
think
we
have
the
harm
befalling
super
tire
at
this
posture
of
the
case.
in
effect,
super
tire
claims
that
there
is
a
continuing
effect
upon
it.
but
then,
in
oil
workers,
the
employees
said
that
they
could
have
a
continuing
effect
upon
them
since
they
did
not
have
a
right
to
strike.
but
the
court
said
that
is
somewhat
speculative
and
here
too,
we
think
to
say
that
this
employer
has
as
continuing
controversy
and
that
the
case
is
still
alive
ignores
the
realities
of
the
situation.
we,
as
the
union,
have
a
contract
with
this
employer.
we
are
at
peace
with
the
employer.
we
do
not
feel
that
we
have
an
antagonistic
interest
with
him.
the
state
of
new
jersey,
as
such,
is
not
doing
anything
to
this
employer.
we
would
also
point
out
to
the
court
in
oil
workers.
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
a
very
good
point
that
if
the
court
acted,
they
could
not
really
issue
an
effective
order
because,
in
effect,
in
oil
workers
the
labor
dispute
was
over.
here
too,
if
the
court
were
to
issue
an
order,
it
would
be
ordering
the
respondent
state
officials
to
do
that
which
they
have
already
done,
which
is
already
done
with.
they
would
be
ordering
them
not
to
make
welfare
payments
to
the
particular
employees
involved
and,
as
such,
it
would
be
impossible
to
do
anything
because,
quite
frankly,
they
are
no
longer
making
these
welfare
payments.
we
would,
therefore,
think
that
the
case
of
oil
workers
and
the
four
criteria
relied
upon
by
the
judge
below,
judge
adams,
should
be
affirmed.
i
think
in
closing
on
the
mootness
issue
itself,
i
think
the
words
of
judge
adams
were
quite
--
mr.
robert
o’brien
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
i
do
not
understand.
mr.
robert
o’brien
the
decision
below
was
vacated
in
the
district
court
and
a
new
order
was
told
to
be
entered
by
the
district
court.
mr.
robert
o’brien
yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
effect,
the
words
of
judge
adams
that
“a
court
acts
only
when
called
upon
to
act,
can
it
legitimately
act
at
all?”
here,
i
do
not
think
the
court
can
say
that
it
is
really
required
to
act
since
the
strike
has
ended,
since
this
matter
has
now
in
effect
terminated
between
this
employer
and
these
employees.
we
would,
therefore,
ask
the
court
to
look
at
the
four
criteria,
to
look
at
oil
workers
which
is
very,
very
applicable
rationale
and,
in
effect,
declare
this
case
to
have
been
mooted
out
below.
thank
you.
