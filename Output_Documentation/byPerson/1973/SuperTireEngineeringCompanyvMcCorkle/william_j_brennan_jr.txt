justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
cohen,
suppose
we
agree
with
you
and
it
is
not
moot,
what
do
we
do
with
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
they
did
not
decide
it
below.
why
should
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
do
not
overstate
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
can
you
tell
me,
mr.
cohen,
are
the
new
jersey
statute
or
a
statute,
whatever
it
is,
is
that
a
counterpart
precisely
of
similar
statutes
in
other
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
am
speaking
of
welfare
payments
to
strikers.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
every
other
state,
the
strikers
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
get
payments
under
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
yet
you
suggest,
despite
these
differences,
that
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
generous
are
the
state
generals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
new
jersey?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
pretty
absolute
stake.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
there
been
any
practice
in
new
jersey,
before
new
jersey
withdrew
from
afdc,
on
payments
in
such
versions
like
this
under
afdc?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
never
goes
back
therefore
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
my
recollection
is
not
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
the
middle
1950s?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
has
to
mean,
i
gather
it.
that
if
the
only
possible
work
available
is
that
struck
plant
where
he
is
striking
new
jersey,
nevertheless,
pays
him
welfare
benefits
because
new
jersey
does
not
require
him
to
accept
work
at
the
struck
plant.
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
be
interested
to
--
is
this
a
matter
of
administrative
interpretation
of
the
requirement
or
is
there
a
new
jersey
court
decision
that
says
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
i
understand
you,
mr.
skillman,
to
say
that
new
jersey
did
disqualify
them,
at
least
insofar
as
the
federal
categorical
assistance
programs
are
concerned,
new
jersey
would
violate
the
provisions
of
the
federal
requirements?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
what
i
thought,
so
that
new
jersey
could
disqualify
him
because
he
refused
to
accept
work
without
violating
any
federal
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
there
would
be
no
conflict
at
all
between
the
federal
welfare
laws
and
the
labor
laws
if
he
was
disqualified.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
why?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
i
just
asked
you
if
a
man
refuses
to
take
a
job,
is
there
need?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know,
but
it
does
not
--
you
just
told
me
it
would
not
violate
the
federal
law
if
this
man
was
disqualified.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
okay.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
new
jersey
includes
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
do
not
interpret
as
strike
as
staying
away
from
work
on
account
of
a
strike
is
refusing
to
take
available
employment.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
although
the
federal
law
would
not
be
inconsistent
with
federal
law
if
you
did
disqualify
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
you
did
disqualify
him.
it
would
be
consistent
with
federal
law
if
you
did
disqualify
him.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather,
mr.
skillman,
that
all
that
new
jersey
has
withdrawn
from
effective
june
30,
1971
is
the
unemployed
parent
segment
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
of
the
afdc.
new
jersey
still
participates,
otherwise,
in
the
afdc
program.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
so
far
as
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
unemployed
parent
segment
is
concerned,
to
the
extent
he
has
covered,
he
is
covered
under
new
jersey’s
own
assistance
to
families
of
the
working
poor.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
the
regulation
that
we
have
here
is
a
regulation
applicable
to
that
state
program,
assistance
to
families
of
the
working
poor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
do
not
see
how
it
is
applicable
to
the
unemployed
parent
segment
of
the
afdc
program
that
you
have
withdrawn
from.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
the
unemployed
parent
is
a
consideration.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
mr.
cohen
suggested
that
if
we
get
to
the
merits
we
ought
to
decide
it
here
without
sending
it
back,
or
the
life
will
be
--
everything
you
have
said
indicates
more
forcefully
--
if
we
agree
that
this
case
is
not
moot
in
the
first
instance,
we
have
got
to
send
it
back
and
let
the
three-judge
court
wrestle
with
it.
they
will
know
a
lot
more
about
the
new
jersey
situation
than
we
could
possibly
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
may
involve
more
than
that.
it
may
involve
some
questions
of
construction
of
the
new
jersey
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suggest,
mr.
skillman,
some
of
the
things
you
have
been
saying
to
us
indicate
that
matters
of
construction
of
the
new
jersey
statutes
may
be
very
significant.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
what
we
held
in
davidson
against
francis,
is
it
not,
in
affirming
per
curiam,
that
district
court
decision
of
maryland?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
do
you
think
was
decided
in
davidson?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right,
and
the
district
court
held
and
we
affirmed
it,
as
i
remember
it.
that
maryland
was
required
under
the
federal
statute
to
make
payments
to
unemployed
parents
who
are
unemployed
by
reason
of
a
labor
dispute.
is
it
not
correct?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
in
light
of
mr.
skillman,
i
thought
he
said
the
main
part
of
this
case
was
the
federal
categorical
assistance
programs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
know
but
you
want
us
to
interpret
it.
why
should
be
interpret
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
is
your
view
of
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
mentioned
a
three-judge
--
was
this
a
three-judge
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
single-judge,
who
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
is
now
dead.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
is
just
the
problem.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
cohen,
suppose
we
agree

you
and
it

what
do
we
do
with
it?
justice
william
j.

they

why
should
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
do
not
overstate

justice
william
j.
brennan,

yes.

can
