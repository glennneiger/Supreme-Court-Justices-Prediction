mr.
stephen
skillman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
single
issue
on
the
merits
of
this
case
is
one
of
congressional
intent.
has
congress
expressed
the
intent
to
prohibit
the
payment
of
welfare
benefits
to
strikers?
i
think
the
petitioner
would
agree
with
that
formulation
of
the
issue.
mr.
stephen
skillman
your
honor,
the
state
is
in
a
somewhat
anomalous
position
on
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
we
would
say
that
if
our
analysis
of
the
merits
of
the
case
is
correct,
that
you
look
to
the
--
i
do
not
mean
ultimately
on
the
merits
but
i
mean,
as
to
what
you
look
to,
the
general
legislative
history.
this
is
a
question
of
abstract
general
law
applicable
across
the
board
and
not
depending
on
the
particular
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
1971
strike
then
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
the
state
officials,
the
commissioner
of
institutions
and
agencies,
and
the
director
of
the
division
of
public
welfare.
but,
we
have
not
urged
in
any
point
of
this
obligation,
mr.
justice
white
that
the
case
should
be
disposed
off
on
grounds
of
mootness.
we
have
not
gone
to
the
other
extreme
of
taking
issue
with
it.
we
have
just
not
taken
a
position
on
this
issue.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
skillman
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
started
by
indicating
prior
to
the
luncheon
break,
i
think
that
the
state
is
on
common
grounds
with
the
petitioner
in
saying
that
this
case
on
the
merits,
involves
an
issue
of
congressional
intent.
our
area
of
disagreement,
however,
is
whether
in
ascertaining
that
the
intent
of
congress
--
the
court
should
look
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
urged
by
the
petitioner
or
whether
as
urged
by
the
state,
it
should
look
to
the
federal
categorical
assistance
provisions
of
the
social
security
act.
if
congress
had
not
dealt
comprehensively
with
the
subject
of
welfare
in
the
social
security
act,
then
it
would
be
arguable
certainly
that
the
court
should
look
to
the
national
labor
relations
act,
look
to
certain
underlying
principles
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
with
regard
to
collective-bargaining,
whether
or
not
those
principles
require
a
principle
of
neutrality
by
the
state
in
labor
disputes
and
whether
or
not
there
is
an
important
countervailing
state
interest,
as
we
certainly
would
say
that
there
is,
in
providing
assistance
to
the
needy.
however,
the
primary
welfare
programs
in
effect
in
this
country
today
are
themselves
federal
programs
enacted
by
congress,
as
was
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
since
the
provisions
of
the
social
security
act,
dealing
with
those
welfare
programs,
specifically
outline
conditions
of
eligibility
for
the
receipt
of
welfare,
rather
than
as
to
these
provisions
enacted
by
congress,
rather
than
the
general
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
dealing
with
collective-bargaining
that
the
court
should
look
in
ascertaining
whether
or
not
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
to
prevent
the
payment
of
welfare
to
needy
individuals
who
happened
to
be
on
strike.
now,
when
you
look
to
the
social
security
act,
you
find
no
such
expression
of
congressional
intent.
rather,
with
the
main
federal
categorical
assistance
program
and
the
one,
remaining
principal
federal
categorical
assistance
program
still
in
effect
in
new
jersey,
that
involving
the
so-called
one-parent
household,
there
are
two
criteria
of
eligibility.
one;
that
a
parent
be
dead,
absent
from
the
home,
or
disabled,
and
two;
that
there
be
the
requisite
need.
now
for
the
court
to
hold
that
there
is
a
disqualification
from
the
receipt
of
benefits
under
this
program
for
strikers,
it
would,
in
effect,
have
to
read
into
the
act,
a
further
condition
of
eligibility
which
is
simply
not
in
the
provisions
of
the
federal
social
security
act.
mr.
stephen
skillman
your
honor,
it
is
my
understanding
that
it
is
difficult
to
piece
this
fact
before
’57
which
is
the
day
of
the
regulation
in
question
here
but
it
is
my
understanding,
that
new
jersey
under
the
federal
categorical
assistance
programs
has
never
disqualified
strikers.
mr.
stephen
skillman
never,
i
assume
back
to
1935,
but
my
source
of
knowledge
is
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
my
source
of
knowledge,
as
i
say,
is
internal
agency
memoranda
from
the
middle
1950s
which
indicate
that
that
was
the
case
with
respect
to
the
federal
categorical
assistance
programs.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
the
date
of
the
memoranda
which,
i
must
say,
are
my
only
vision
of
what
occurred
prior
to
the
middle
50's.
but,
those
memoranda
indicate
that
benefits
have
been
paid
on
the
federal
categorical
assistance
programs
but
not
under
state
general
assistance.
and
it
was
because
there
was
considerable
controversy
with
respect
to
state
general
assistance
that
we
had
several
bills
that
went
into
the
state
legislation
in
the
middle
of
the
1950s
and,
finally,
the
regulation
which
has
become
the
focus
of
this
case
and
which,
although
by
its
terms
is
only
applicable
to
state
general
assistance,
has,
as
a
matter
of
administrative
application,
been
applied
to
the
federal
categorical
assistance
programs
as
well.
mr.
stephen
skillman
your
honor,
first
of
all
with
respect
to
new
jersey’s
participation
in
the
federal
categorical
assistance
programs
which
is
the
main
part
of
this
case
we
are,
of
course
required
to
abide
by
federal
requirements
and
not
by
state
requirements
except
to
the
extent
that
the
state
may
have
the
option
to
augment
or
supplement
federal
requirements.
but
my
understanding
is
that,
under
both
the
applicable
federal
and
state
provisions,
that
there
were
ordinarily
certain
exceptions
to
this
but,
ordinarily,
an
applicant
for
assistance
must
be
prepared
to
seek
and
accept
work.
and,
i
do
not
think
the
striker
would
be
any
exception
to
this.
in
other
words,
he
has
an
obligation
to
seek
and
accept
work
other
than
work
with
the
employer
from
whom
he
is
striking.
mr.
stephen
skillman
no,
all
the
statute
says
is
that
anyone
who
applies
for
categorical
assistance
or
general
assistance
must
be
ready
to
seek
and
accept
employment.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
he
is
refusing
to
work
for
one
particular
employer.
he
is
not
refusing
to
work
for
another
employer
and
it
is
not
that
uncommon
for
someone
who
is
out
on
strike,
particularly
when
you
are
speaking
about
a
lengthy
strike
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
an
exception.
i
think,
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
there
is
an
obligation
of
any
applicant
for
assistance
to
seek
and
accept
employment.
that
is
not
limited
to
any
particular
employer,
and
the
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
new
jersey’s
position
on
that
is
that
the
striker
may
be
called
upon
to
seek
and
accept
employment
with
an
employer
other
than
the
employer
from
whom
he
is
on
strike.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
all
the
statutes
says
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct,
with
his
regular
employer
but
not
generally
refusing
to
accept
employment.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
the
position
has
to
be
that
the
employee
is
permitted
not
to
go
back
to
work
with
that
particular
employer
and
i
think
that
the
foundation
for
that
position
by
the
state
of
new
jersey,
itself
draws
sustenance
from
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct
as
a
matter
of
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
there
is
no
court
decision
on
this
point,
your
honor.
and,
certainly,
in
the
face
of
the
regulation
which
was
the
focus
of
the
case,
all
that
regulation
says
is
that
an
individual
is
not
disqualified
from
receiving
welfare
benefits
by
virtue
of
being
on
strike.
it
does
not
go
on
and
deal
with
the
various
situations
which
may
arise
under
--
satisfying
the
various
conditions
by
their
federal
or
state
statute.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
the
federal
requirements
are
quite
similar
with
respect
to
an
individual
being
willing
to
accept
work
so
i
would
say,
no.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
skillman
no,
but
that
has
not
been
the
focus
of
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
--of
this
case.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
when
you
say
that
in
the
labor
law,
there
is
certainly
a
great
conflict
between
the
provisions
of
the
social
security
act
and
what
the
petitioner
would
like
to
read
into
the
labor
law.
mr.
stephen
skillman
because
the
federal
act
requires
two
principal
criteria
of
eligibility.
one;
that
you
have
the
one-parent
home
and,
number
two;
that
there
be
need.
mr.
stephen
skillman
once
those
two
criteria
are
satisfied
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
there
still
is
need,
certainly.
mr.
stephen
skillman
individually,
he
may
be
disqualified.
his
family
may
not
be
disqualified,
so
that
you
are
talking
--
in
that
type
of
situation,
if
i
can
get
away
for
a
second
from
the
labor
content
but
let
us
take
an
individual
who
refuses
to
work.
he
says
“i
do
not
want
to
work.”
mr.
stephen
skillman
the
family
may
still
receive
assistance
under
federal
categorical
assistance
programs.
that
particular
indolent
individual,
his
needs
will
not
be
included
in
the
calculation
of
the
needs
of
his
family.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
new
jersey
would
not
include
him
if,
in
fact,
he
has
not
taken
available
work.
new
jersey
requires,
as
does
the
federal
government
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
skillman
not
inconsistent
with
federal
law?
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
federal
social
security
act
to
disqualify
the
individual
but
not
his
family
if
he
is
available
for
work.
we
get
right
back
around
to
the
same
question
and
that
is
what
is
the
meaning
of
refusing
to
take
available
work,
and
when
you
have
a
strike
situation,
can
it
fairly
be
said
that
there
is
available
work
taking
into
account,
as
the
petitioner
would
have
the
court
in
other
respects
taking
into
account,
the
policies
which
underlie
the
national
labor
relations
act
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
would
make
it
permissible.
mr.
stephen
skillman
in
terms
of
“available
for
work”?
mr.
stephen
skillman
it
is
my
understanding
that
this
is
the
policy
of
the
new
jersey
division
of
public
welfare
not
expressed
in
the
regulation
and
that
it
is
also
the
position
with
respect
to
the
federal
categorical
assistance
programs
of
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare.
so,
we
are
not
talking
here
about
the
position
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
alone
but
i
think
a
position
in
common
with
that,
held
by
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
“available
for
work”.
i
guess
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
skillman
and
the
other
parts
of
the
program
that
it
participates
in
are
the
principal
parts
of
the
program.
in
the
present
time,
in
new
jersey,
we
have
422,000
people
on
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
afdc.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
has
taken
the
place,
as
of
july
1,
1971,
of
the
unemployed
parent
segment.
mr.
stephen
skillman
by
its
terms,
it
is
applicable
only
to
general
assistance
which
afwp
does
not
technically
fall
under.
mr.
stephen
skillman
as
a
matter
of
administrative
application,
it
is
applied
to
general
assistance,
to
afwp,
and
to
the
federal
categorical
assistance
programs.
so,
as
a
atter
of
administrative
application
that
is
applied
across
the
board.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
it
does
not
apply
to
programs
that
we
are
not
participating
in
but
it
is
applicable
to
all
programs
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
is
participating
in.
mr.
stephen
skillman
so
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
no,
that
is
the
one
program
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
your
honor,
if
i
may
briefly
direct
myself
to
that
question
because
i
think
it
is
important.
i
think
that
when
this
case
is
fully
analyzed,
it
will
be
shown
that
the
case
really
turns
on
an
analysis
of
the
meaning
of
federal
statutes,
most
specifically
the
federal
social
security
act.
if
we
are
wrong
in
this
and
if
the
case
requires
factual
development,
then
i
think
it
is
obvious.
this
court
cannot
decide
the
case.
mr.
stephen
skillman
likewise,
if
it
involves
those
sorts
of
questions,
i,
again
agree
the
case
would
have
to
go
back
before
the
courts
could
reach
the
merits
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
does.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
may,
your
honor,
have
to
the
extent
that
my
response
to
some
of
the
questions
may
have
suggested
that
there
is
not
a
congruence
between
the
new
jersey
statutes
and
federal
statutes
and
between
new
jersey
administrative
interpretations
and
federal
hew
interpretations.
i
think
i
might
have
suggested
that,
but
i
think
that
that
is
incorrect.
that
essentially,
all
that
new
jersey
is
doing
with
respect
to
both
the
federal
categorical
assistance
programs
and
its
own
state-created
programs
is
what
is
required
by
the
federal
social
security
act
in
what
has
been
recognized
to
be
required
by
the
federal
social
security
act.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
i
think
that
there
is
some
dispute
as
to
what
exactly
the
court
did
hold
there
because,
and
i
think
that
the
petitioner
rightly
points
out
in
his
reply
brief
that,
the
jurisdictional
statement
filed
by
the
state
of
maryland
did
not
specifically
raise
the
issues
that
are
being
raised
at
this
time.
a
jurisdictional
statement
filed
with
the
chamber
of
commerce
did,
however.
but,
as
a
technical
matter,
that
was
dismissed
on
procedural
grounds
and
not
on
the
merits.
so,
as
a
very
technical
matter,
it
may
be
said
that
this
court
has
not
already
reached
this
issue
in
davidson
but
i
think
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
that
case
involved
specific
questions
of
interpretation
of
the
unemployed
parent
segment
of
the
afdc
statutes.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
is
what
the
court
held,
but
i
would
have
to
concede
that
that
district
court
opinion
is
difficult
reading.
it
can
be
read
to
have
dealt
solely
with
the
conformity
of
what
maryland
was
doing
with
certain
federal
regulations
without
going
further
to
the
next
step
of
examining
the
provisions
of
the
social
security
act
which
those
regulations
were
predicated
on.
it
is
a
difficult
decision.
mr.
stephen
skillman
first
of
all,
your
honor,
if
i
may
answer
that
by
correcting,
i
think,
what
is
perhaps
a
misconception.
he
would
not
come
into
the
new
jersey
welfare
office
and
say
“i
am
on
strike.”
he
would
come
into
the
new
jersey
welfare
office
and
say
“i
am
needy,”
and
the
only
question
would
be
whether
or
not
new
jersey
should
disqualify
a
needy
individual
who,
otherwise,
would
be
eligible
simply
because
of
the
fact
that
the
reason
for
his
being
needy
is
that
he
is
on
strike
and
new
jersey
would
not
draw
any
distinction
between
the
lockout
situation,
the
supervisory
employee
situation,
the
employee
who
is
on
strike
but
had
dissented
on
the
vote
as
to
whether
or
not
a
strike
should
be
taken
and
the
employee
who
had
voted
to
go
on
strike.
in
either
instance,
what
new
jersey
would
look
to,
and
what
i
think
the
federal
social
security
act
would
require
new
jersey
to
look
to,
under
its
provisions
is,
is
the
individual
needy?
that
is
the
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
the
utility
individual
who
is
in
effect
refusing
to
cross
the
picket
line
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
would
think
that,
although
those
sections
are
not
involved
here,
i
would
be
quite
sure
that
the
state
would
find
that
individual
to
be
disqualified
as
not
being
willing
to
take
available
work
mr.
stephen
skillman
we
have
not
suggested
any
federal
equal
protection
consideration
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
can
conceive
of
factual
circumstances
in
which
there
might
be,
but
that
is
not
what
we
are
relying
on
here.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that,
i
think,
is
the
line
that
new
jersey
would
take.
it
is
not
what
it
said
by
the
regulations
before
the
court.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
the
line
i
think
the
state
would
take
as
a
matter
of
interpretation
of
the
underlying
federal
and
state
law.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
the
striker
who
is
on
strike
against
an
employer
is
doing
something
that
has
certain
protection
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
that
is
not
true
of
the
individual
who
has
his
own
private
war
with
respect
to
some
private
interest.
mr.
stephen
skillman
conceivably,
maybe
there
would
be
an
equal
protection
question
if
you
could
spell
that
out
but
i
think
i
would
have
some
difficulty
with
that.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
skillman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
single
issue
on
the
merits
of
this
case
is
one
of
congressional
intent.
has
congress
expressed
the
intent
to
prohibit
the
payment
of
welfare
benefits
to
strikers?
i
think
the
petitioner
would
agree
with
that
formulation
of
the
issue.
mr.
stephen
skillman
your
honor,
the
state
is
in
a
somewhat
anomalous
position
on
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
we
would
say
that
if
our
analysis
of
the
merits
of
the
case
is
correct,
that
you
look
to
the
--
i
do
not
mean
ultimately
on
the
merits
but
i
mean,
as
to
what
you
look
to,
the
general
legislative
history.
this
is
a
question
of
abstract
general
law
applicable
across
the
board
and
not
depending
on
the
particular
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
1971
strike
then
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
the
state
officials,
the
commissioner
of
institutions
and
agencies,
and
the
director
of
the
division
of
public
welfare.
but,
we
have
not
urged
in
any
point
of
this
obligation,
mr.
justice
white
that
the
case
should
be
disposed
off
on
grounds
of
mootness.
we
have
not
gone
to
the
other
extreme
of
taking
issue
with
it.
we
have
just
not
taken
a
position
on
this
issue.
thank
you.
mr.
stephen
skillman
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
started
by
indicating
prior
to
the
luncheon
break,
i
think
that
the
state
is
on
common
grounds
with
the
petitioner
in
saying
that
this
case
on
the
merits,
involves
an
issue
of
congressional
intent.
our
area
of
disagreement,
however,
is
whether
in
ascertaining
that
the
intent
of
congress
--
the
court
should
look
to
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
urged
by
the
petitioner
or
whether
as
urged
by
the
state,
it
should
look
to
the
federal
categorical
assistance
provisions
of
the
social
security
act.
if
congress
had
not
dealt
comprehensively
with
the
subject
of
welfare
in
the
social
security
act,
then
it
would
be
arguable
certainly
that
the
court
should
look
to
the
national
labor
relations
act,
look
to
certain
underlying
principles
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
with
regard
to
collective-bargaining,
whether
or
not
those
principles
require
a
principle
of
neutrality
by
the
state
in
labor
disputes
and
whether
or
not
there
is
an
important
countervailing
state
interest,
as
we
certainly
would
say
that
there
is,
in
providing
assistance
to
the
needy.
however,
the
primary
welfare
programs
in
effect
in
this
country
today
are
themselves
federal
programs
enacted
by
congress,
as
was
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
since
the
provisions
of
the
social
security
act,
dealing
with
those
welfare
programs,
specifically
outline
conditions
of
eligibility
for
the
receipt
of
welfare,
rather
than
as
to
these
provisions
enacted
by
congress,
rather
than
the
general
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
dealing
with
collective-bargaining
that
the
court
should
look
in
ascertaining
whether
or
not
it
was
the
intention
of
congress
to
prevent
the
payment
of
welfare
to
needy
individuals
who
happened
to
be
on
strike.
now,
when
you
look
to
the
social
security
act,
you
find
no
such
expression
of
congressional
intent.
rather,
with
the
main
federal
categorical
assistance
program
and
the
one,
remaining
principal
federal
categorical
assistance
program
still
in
effect
in
new
jersey,
that
involving
the
so-called
one-parent
household,
there
are
two
criteria
of
eligibility.
one;
that
a
parent
be
dead,
absent
from
the
home,
or
disabled,
and
two;
that
there
be
the
requisite
need.
now
for
the
court
to
hold
that
there
is
a
disqualification
from
the
receipt
of
benefits
under
this
program
for
strikers,
it
would,
in
effect,
have
to
read
into
the
act,
a
further
condition
of
eligibility
which
is
simply
not
in
the
provisions
of
the
federal
social
security
act.
mr.
stephen
skillman
your
honor,
it
is
my
understanding
that
it
is
difficult
to
piece
this
fact
before
’57
which
is
the
day
of
the
regulation
in
question
here
but
it
is
my
understanding,
that
new
jersey
under
the
federal
categorical
assistance
programs
has
never
disqualified
strikers.
mr.
stephen
skillman
never,
i
assume
back
to
1935,
but
my
source
of
knowledge
is
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
my
source
of
knowledge,
as
i
say,
is
internal
agency
memoranda
from
the
middle
1950s
which
indicate
that
that
was
the
case
with
respect
to
the
federal
categorical
assistance
programs.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
the
date
of
the
memoranda
which,
i
must
say,
are
my
only
vision
of
what
occurred
prior
to
the
middle
50's.
but,
those
memoranda
indicate
that
benefits
have
been
paid
on
the
federal
categorical
assistance
programs
but
not
under
state
general
assistance.
and
it
was
because
there
was
considerable
controversy
with
respect
to
state
general
assistance
that
we
had
several
bills
that
went
into
the
state
legislation
in
the
middle
of
the
1950s
and,
finally,
the
regulation
which
has
become
the
focus
of
this
case
and
which,
although
by
its
terms
is
only
applicable
to
state
general
assistance,
has,
as
a
matter
of
administrative
application,
been
applied
to
the
federal
categorical
assistance
programs
as
well.
mr.
stephen
skillman
your
honor,
first
of
all
with
respect
to
new
jersey’s
participation
in
the
federal
categorical
assistance
programs
which
is
the
main
part
of
this
case
we
are,
of
course
required
to
abide
by
federal
requirements
and
not
by
state
requirements
except
to
the
extent
that
the
state
may
have
the
option
to
augment
or
supplement
federal
requirements.
but
my
understanding
is
that,
under
both
the
applicable
federal
and
state
provisions,
that
there
were
ordinarily
certain
exceptions
to
this
but,
ordinarily,
an
applicant
for
assistance
must
be
prepared
to
seek
and
accept
work.
and,
i
do
not
think
the
striker
would
be
any
exception
to
this.
in
other
words,
he
has
an
obligation
to
seek
and
accept
work
other
than
work
with
the
employer
from
whom
he
is
striking.
mr.
stephen
skillman
no,
all
the
statute
says
is
that
anyone
who
applies
for
categorical
assistance
or
general
assistance
must
be
ready
to
seek
and
accept
employment.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
he
is
refusing
to
work
for
one
particular
employer.
he
is
not
refusing
to
work
for
another
employer
and
it
is
not
that
uncommon
for
someone
who
is
out
on
strike,
particularly
when
you
are
speaking
about
a
lengthy
strike
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
do
not
think
that
it
is
an
exception.
i
think,
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
there
is
an
obligation
of
any
applicant
for
assistance
to
seek
and
accept
employment.
that
is
not
limited
to
any
particular
employer,
and
the
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
new
jersey’s
position
on
that
is
that
the
striker
may
be
called
upon
to
seek
and
accept
employment
with
an
employer
other
than
the
employer
from
whom
he
is
on
strike.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
all
the
statutes
says
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct,
with
his
regular
employer
but
not
generally
refusing
to
accept
employment.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
the
position
has
to
be
that
the
employee
is
permitted
not
to
go
back
to
work
with
that
particular
employer
and
i
think
that
the
foundation
for
that
position
by
the
state
of
new
jersey,
itself
draws
sustenance
from
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct
as
a
matter
of
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
there
is
no
court
decision
on
this
point,
your
honor.
and,
certainly,
in
the
face
of
the
regulation
which
was
the
focus
of
the
case,
all
that
regulation
says
is
that
an
individual
is
not
disqualified
from
receiving
welfare
benefits
by
virtue
of
being
on
strike.
it
does
not
go
on
and
deal
with
the
various
situations
which
may
arise
under
--
satisfying
the
various
conditions
by
their
federal
or
state
statute.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
the
federal
requirements
are
quite
similar
with
respect
to
an
individual
being
willing
to
accept
work
so
i
would
say,
no.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
skillman
no,
but
that
has
not
been
the
focus
of
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
--of
this
case.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
when
you
say
that
in
the
labor
law,
there
is
certainly
a
great
conflict
between
the
provisions
of
the
social
security
act
and
what
the
petitioner
would
like
to
read
into
the
labor
law.
mr.
stephen
skillman
because
the
federal
act
requires
two
principal
criteria
of
eligibility.
one;
that
you
have
the
one-parent
home
and,
number
two;
that
there
be
need.
mr.
stephen
skillman
once
those
two
criteria
are
satisfied
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
there
still
is
need,
certainly.
mr.
stephen
skillman
individually,
he
may
be
disqualified.
his
family
may
not
be
disqualified,
so
that
you
are
talking
--
in
that
type
of
situation,
if
i
can
get
away
for
a
second
from
the
labor
content
but
let
us
take
an
individual
who
refuses
to
work.
he
says
“i
do
not
want
to
work.”
mr.
stephen
skillman
the
family
may
still
receive
assistance
under
federal
categorical
assistance
programs.
that
particular
indolent
individual,
his
needs
will
not
be
included
in
the
calculation
of
the
needs
of
his
family.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
new
jersey
would
not
include
him
if,
in
fact,
he
has
not
taken
available
work.
new
jersey
requires,
as
does
the
federal
government
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
skillman
not
inconsistent
with
federal
law?
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
federal
social
security
act
to
disqualify
the
individual
but
not
his
family
if
he
is
available
for
work.
we
get
right
back
around
to
the
same
question
and
that
is
what
is
the
meaning
of
refusing
to
take
available
work,
and
when
you
have
a
strike
situation,
can
it
fairly
be
said
that
there
is
available
work
taking
into
account,
as
the
petitioner
would
have
the
court
in
other
respects
taking
into
account,
the
policies
which
underlie
the
national
labor
relations
act
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
would
make
it
permissible.
mr.
stephen
skillman
in
terms
of
“available
for
work”?
mr.
stephen
skillman
it
is
my
understanding
that
this
is
the
policy
of
the
new
jersey
division
of
public
welfare
not
expressed
in
the
regulation
and
that
it
is
also
the
position
with
respect
to
the
federal
categorical
assistance
programs
of
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare.
so,
we
are
not
talking
here
about
the
position
of
the
state
of
new
jersey
alone
but
i
think
a
position
in
common
with
that,
held
by
the
department
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
“available
for
work”.
i
guess
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
correct.
mr.
stephen
skillman
and
the
other
parts
of
the
program
that
it
participates
in
are
the
principal
parts
of
the
program.
in
the
present
time,
in
new
jersey,
we
have
422,000
people
on
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
afdc.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
has
taken
the
place,
as
of
july
1,
1971,
of
the
unemployed
parent
segment.
mr.
stephen
skillman
by
its
terms,
it
is
applicable
only
to
general
assistance
which
afwp
does
not
technically
fall
under.
mr.
stephen
skillman
as
a
matter
of
administrative
application,
it
is
applied
to
general
assistance,
to
afwp,
and
to
the
federal
categorical
assistance
programs.
so,
as
a
atter
of
administrative
application
that
is
applied
across
the
board.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
it
does
not
apply
to
programs
that
we
are
not
participating
in
but
it
is
applicable
to
all
programs
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
is
participating
in.
mr.
stephen
skillman
so
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
no,
that
is
the
one
program
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
your
honor,
if
i
may
briefly
direct
myself
to
that
question
because
i
think
it
is
important.
i
think
that
when
this
case
is
fully
analyzed,
it
will
be
shown
that
the
case
really
turns
on
an
analysis
of
the
meaning
of
federal
statutes,
most
specifically
the
federal
social
security
act.
if
we
are
wrong
in
this
and
if
the
case
requires
factual
development,
then
i
think
it
is
obvious.
this
court
cannot
decide
the
case.
mr.
stephen
skillman
likewise,
if
it
involves
those
sorts
of
questions,
i,
again
agree
the
case
would
have
to
go
back
before
the
courts
could
reach
the
merits
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
does.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
may,
your
honor,
have
to
the
extent
that
my
response
to
some
of
the
questions
may
have
suggested
that
there
is
not
a
congruence
between
the
new
jersey
statutes
and
federal
statutes
and
between
new
jersey
administrative
interpretations
and
federal
hew
interpretations.
i
think
i
might
have
suggested
that,
but
i
think
that
that
is
incorrect.
that
essentially,
all
that
new
jersey
is
doing
with
respect
to
both
the
federal
categorical
assistance
programs
and
its
own
state-created
programs
is
what
is
required
by
the
federal
social
security
act
in
what
has
been
recognized
to
be
required
by
the
federal
social
security
act.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
i
think
that
there
is
some
dispute
as
to
what
exactly
the
court
did
hold
there
because,
and
i
think
that
the
petitioner
rightly
points
out
in
his
reply
brief
that,
the
jurisdictional
statement
filed
by
the
state
of
maryland
did
not
specifically
raise
the
issues
that
are
being
raised
at
this
time.
a
jurisdictional
statement
filed
with
the
chamber
of
commerce
did,
however.
but,
as
a
technical
matter,
that
was
dismissed
on
procedural
grounds
and
not
on
the
merits.
so,
as
a
very
technical
matter,
it
may
be
said
that
this
court
has
not
already
reached
this
issue
in
davidson
but
i
think
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
that
case
involved
specific
questions
of
interpretation
of
the
unemployed
parent
segment
of
the
afdc
statutes.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
think
that
is
what
the
court
held,
but
i
would
have
to
concede
that
that
district
court
opinion
is
difficult
reading.
it
can
be
read
to
have
dealt
solely
with
the
conformity
of
what
maryland
was
doing
with
certain
federal
regulations
without
going
further
to
the
next
step
of
examining
the
provisions
of
the
social
security
act
which
those
regulations
were
predicated
on.
it
is
a
difficult
decision.
mr.
stephen
skillman
first
of
all,
your
honor,
if
i
may
answer
that
by
correcting,
i
think,
what
is
perhaps
a
misconception.
he
would
not
come
into
the
new
jersey
welfare
office
and
say
“i
am
on
strike.”
he
would
come
into
the
new
jersey
welfare
office
and
say
“i
am
needy,”
and
the
only
question
would
be
whether
or
not
new
jersey
should
disqualify
a
needy
individual
who,
otherwise,
would
be
eligible
simply
because
of
the
fact
that
the
reason
for
his
being
needy
is
that
he
is
on
strike
and
new
jersey
would
not
draw
any
distinction
between
the
lockout
situation,
the
supervisory
employee
situation,
the
employee
who
is
on
strike
but
had
dissented
on
the
vote
as
to
whether
or
not
a
strike
should
be
taken
and
the
employee
who
had
voted
to
go
on
strike.
in
either
instance,
what
new
jersey
would
look
to,
and
what
i
think
the
federal
social
security
act
would
require
new
jersey
to
look
to,
under
its
provisions
is,
is
the
individual
needy?
that
is
the
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
the
utility
individual
who
is
in
effect
refusing
to
cross
the
picket
line
--
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
would
think
that,
although
those
sections
are
not
involved
here,
i
would
be
quite
sure
that
the
state
would
find
that
individual
to
be
disqualified
as
not
being
willing
to
take
available
work
mr.
stephen
skillman
we
have
not
suggested
any
federal
equal
protection
consideration
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
skillman
i
can
conceive
of
factual
circumstances
in
which
there
might
be,
but
that
is
not
what
we
are
relying
on
here.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that,
i
think,
is
the
line
that
new
jersey
would
take.
it
is
not
what
it
said
by
the
regulations
before
the
court.
mr.
stephen
skillman
that
is
the
line
i
think
the
state
would
take
as
a
matter
of
interpretation
of
the
underlying
federal
and
state
law.
mr.
stephen
skillman
well,
the
striker
who
is
on
strike
against
an
employer
is
doing
something
that
has
certain
protection
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
that
is
not
true
of
the
individual
who
has
his
own
private
war
with
respect
to
some
private
interest.
mr.
stephen
skillman
conceivably,
maybe
there
would
be
an
equal
protection
question
if
you
could
spell
that
out
but
i
think
i
would
have
some
difficulty
with
that.
thank
you.
