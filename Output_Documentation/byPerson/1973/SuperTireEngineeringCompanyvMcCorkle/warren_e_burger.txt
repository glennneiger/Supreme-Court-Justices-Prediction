chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
72-1554,
super
tire
engineering
against
mccorkle.
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
have
you
cited
any
case
to
us
in
which
this
case
has
taken
that
route
that
you
are
now
suggesting?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
o’brien.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
mr.
cohen’s
argument
that
by
definition,
a
striker
is
refusing
to
take
available
work
and
it
is
therefore,
under
new
jersey
law,
automatically
ineligible
for
new
jersey
welfare
relief?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
skillma.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
skillman,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
skillman,
mr.
cohen
in
his
presentation
suggested
that,
by
definition,
a
striker
was
ineligible
under
new
jersey
statutes
because
new
jersey
limited
payments
to
a
person
who
was
ready
to
accept
work,
if
that
work
was
available
and,
again
by
definition,
a
striker
is
rejecting
work
which
is
available,
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
that
in
terms
of
the
new
jersey
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
who
fits
in
this
“other
than”?
is
that
your
reading
of
the
statute
or
does
the
statute
say
“other
than”?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
well,
now,
mr.
cohen’s
point
is
that
a
striker
is
automatically
ineligible
because
he
is
refusing
to
work
in
a
very
vigorous
way,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
i
am
trying
to
get
at
it.
who
writes
in
this
exception
that
you
are
talking
about?
where
does
that
come
from?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
what
is
new
jersey’s
position
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
are
going
around
in
a
circle.
where
does
new
jersey
get
the
authority
for
making
the
exception
if
the
statute
is
as
mr.
cohen
described
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
he
must
accept
work
if
available.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
he
is
declining
to
accept
work
which
is
available
with
his
regular
employer,
is
he
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
each
time
you
come
back,
and
i
am
still
unenlightened,
you
read
an
exception
into
the
statute
for
the
particular
employer
who
has
been
struck.
what
is
new
jersey’s
position
on
that
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
let
me
see
if
i
have
this
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
that
interpretation
is,
by
virtue
of
a
regulation,
that
construction
is
by
virtue
of
regulation
of
the
new
jersey
welfare
department
or
just
their
policy
added
to
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
do
you
think
that
would
present
no
equal
protection
problems?
to
clarify
it,
a
man
who
is
on
strike
against
the
world
as
against
a
man
who
is
on
strike
against
a
particular
employer,
and
you
think
that
new
jersey
may
say
yes.
if
you
are
striking
against
westinghouse
electric,
you
are
qualified
to
receive
welfare.
but
if
you
are
just
on
strike
because
you
are
mad
at
the
world,
they
will
not
give
it
to
you.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
maybe
he
has
got
a
first
amendment
right
not
to
work.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
about
four
minutes
left,
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
he
said
that
hew
has
agreed
with
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
there
is
any
need
for
the
state
courts
of
new
jersey
to
determine
whether
the
policy
of
the
state
welfare
authorities
in
new
jersey
is
consistent
with
the
state
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
if
your
friend,
speaking
for
new
jersey,
said
that
it
was
not
their
regulation
but
merely
an
attitude
or
a
policy.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger

you,
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
