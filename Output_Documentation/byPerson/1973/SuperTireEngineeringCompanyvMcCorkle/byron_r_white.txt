mr.

you
have
said
that
there
is
a
distinction,
for
the
purposes
of
discussion,
between
a
party
on
strike
and
an
able
bodied
person
not
on
strike
who
just
nevertheless
refuses
to
take
a
job.
i
am
thinking
about
how
you
would
define
who
is
on
strike.
assume
for
a
moment
that
you
had
a
supervisory
employee
who
just
decided
he
did
not
like
his
employer
and
he
quit
and
came
into
the
welfare
office
and
said
“i
am
on
strike.
i
would
like
to
collect
my
welfare
check.”
what
would

he
were
able
bodied
and
he

if
he
were
in
need
under
those
circumstances,
he
would
receive
welfare
benefits.

no,

you

i
know
you
have
not,

ask
whether
you

any
such
implications.

you
would
disqualify
