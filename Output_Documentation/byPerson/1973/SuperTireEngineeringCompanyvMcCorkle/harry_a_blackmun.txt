justice
harry

blackmun
this
case
comes
here
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
in
new
jersey,
workers
who
are
on
strike
are
made
eligible
for
public
assistance
through
state
welfare
programs.
the
petitioners
here,
super
tire
engineering
and
another
corporation
are
employers
whose
plants
were
struck.
they
brought
this
suit
against
new
jersey
officials
for
injunctive
and
declaratory
relief
with
respect
to
this
public
assistance
eligibility.
the
employers
claim
that
the
state’s
granted
benefits
to
strikers
was
invalid
because
it
interfered
both
with
federal
labor
policy
as
expressed
in
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
also
with
the
federal
policy
behind
the
social
security
act.
before
the
case
came
to
trial,
the
labor
dispute,
as
is
often
the
case,
was
settled
and
the
strike
came
to
an
end.
the
union,
which
had
intervened
in
the
litigation
then
made
a
suggestion
of
mootness.
the
trial
court
rejected
that
suggestion
and
went
on
to
dismiss
the
compliant
on
the
merits,
observing
that
employers
should
go
to
congress
for
relief.
on
appeal,
the
third
circuit,
by
a
divided
vote
refrained
from
reaching
the
merits
and
instead,
concluded
that
the
case
was
moot,
and
remanded
it
with
instructions
to
dismiss
the
complaint
on
the
ground
of
mootness.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
even
though
the
case
for
an
injunction
evaporated
with
the
settlement
of
the
strike,
the
issue
as
to
the
appropriateness
of
declaratory
relief
remained
open
and
the
requirement
of
article
3,
section
2
of
the
constitution
that
there
be
a
case
or
controversy
between
the
parties,
was
fully
satisfied.
we
distinguish
two
earlier
cases
decided
here;
the
oil
workers
unions
against
missouri
and
harris
against
battle.
we
conclude
that
if
judicial
review
were
to
be
conditioned
on
the
continuing
existence
of
an
economic
strike,
the
case
would
be
of
the
type
presenting
an
issue,
capable
of
repetition
and
yet
evading
review
and
the
purpose
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act
would
be
frustrated.
we
do
not
decide
the
merits
of
the
controversy.
these
are
to
be
passed
upon
in
the
first
instance
by
the
courts
below.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
