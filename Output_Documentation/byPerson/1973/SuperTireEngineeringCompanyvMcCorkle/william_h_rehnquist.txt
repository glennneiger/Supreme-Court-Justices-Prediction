justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cohen,
if
you
are
challenging
a
new
jersey
state
regulation,
does
not
the
new
jersey
court
system
not
provide
some
way
for
challenging
that
through
a
system
of
administrative
appeal
and
then
go
to
the
courts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
a
typical
state
administrative
procedure
act
will
provide
that
a
regulation
can
be
challenged
just
on
a
declaratory
judgment
type
of
basis.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
can
you
not
take
that
to
the
new
jersey
courts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
are
sworn
to
uphold
the
federal
constitution
too,
are
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
mootness
argument
then
really
is
that
when
we
are
talking
about
evading
review
and
that
sort
of
a
thing.
that
the
mootness
ought
to
be
tailored
so
that
you
can,
even
with
a
short-lived
controversy,
get
a
review
on
a
federal
court
every
time
the
preemption
arises.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think,
if
you
recall
the
dorimas
case
some
years
ago
in
this
court,
the
supreme
court
of
new
jersey
apparently
has
different
rules
as
to
mootness
than
we
have.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cohen,
in
moore
against
ogilvie,
which
you
cite,
had
the
case
been
deemed
moot
from
the
beginning
by
the
lower
courts
or
had
it
become
moot
between
the
time
of
the
lower
decision
and
in
this
court’s
proposed
decision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
not
somewhat
different
than
to
say
that
moore
against
ogilvie,
in
effect,
protects
this
court’s
right
to
review
a
recurring
problem
when
the
lower
courts
have
decided
it
in
a
concrete
non-moot
context
as
opposed
to
what
you
are
asking
here
which
is
basically
that
you
start
out
in
the
federal
district
court,
your
court
of
first
jurisdiction
with
something
that
may
already
be
moot.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
say
all
the
employer
has
to
do
is
to
wait
for
a
good
long
strike?
