mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
two
issues
for
decision.
first,
our
substantial
state
welfare
subsidy
is
to
strikers
which
are
payable
solely
because
of
the
strike
and
impermissible
intrusion
upon
the
national
labor
policy
of
free
collective-bargaining.
and
second,
whether
declaratory
judgment
action
to
resolve
that
important
issue
is
rendered
moot
when
the
particular
strike,
during
which
the
payments
are
made
is
settled.
notwithstanding
that
such
payments
continue
and
continue
to
have
an
effect
on
both
the
same
employer
and
other
employers
in
the
state.
this
case
arose
in
may
14,
1971
when
employees
of
super
tire
co.,
who
are
represented
by
respondent
teamsters
local
676,
struck
to
obtain
an
agreement
as
to
their
proposals
for
a
new
collective-bargaining
agreement.
during
the
first
30
days
of
that
strike,
many
of
the
strikers
received
public
welfare
assistance
under
a
totally
state-funded
program,
new
jersey’s
general
public
assistance
program.
subsequently,
after
a
30-day
waiting
period
had
elapsed,
the
strikers
became
eligible
for
and
received
assistance
under
a
joint
federal-state
program,
aid
to
families
of
dependent
children.
the
aided
program
is
no
longer
in
effect
in
new
jersey
and
has
now
been
replaced
by
another
totally
state-funded
program,
aid
to
families
of
the
working
poor.
this
action
was
filed
on
june
10,
1971
after
the
strike
had
continued
for
approximately
three
weeks.
it
sought
both
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
the
crux
of
the
case
was
the
issue
of
whether
the
supremacy
clause
embodying
the
federal
labor
policy
precluded
the
state
and
federal
welfare
subsidies
to
strikers.
the
argument
was
that
such
payments
and
the
availability
of
such
payments
violated
the
national
labor
policy
of
free
collective-bargaining.
this
issue
came
before
the
court
on
june
24,
1971.
the
company
argued
two
things.
first,
it
argued
that,
as
a
manner
of
law,
it
was
correct
that
there
was
a
substantial
state
interference
by
the
statute
itself,
by
the
regulations
itself
and,
therefore,
that
was
an
impermissible
intrusion
of
free
and
collective-bargaining.
it
further
offered
to
demonstrate
through
the
testimony
of
state
officials
who
were
present,
through
the
testimony
of
expert
witnesses
who
were
present
that
there
was
substantial
interference
in
this
particular
case
with
the
collective-bargaining
relations
between
super
tire
and
teamster
local
676.
the
district
court,
however,
orally
dismissed
the
case
under
rule
12b6
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
four
days
later,
on
june
28,
the
strike
ended.
the
employees
returned
to
work.
the
company,
there
upon,
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
which,
in
a
lengthy
divided
opinion,
dismissed
the
appeal
as
moot.
the
basis
for
the
third
circuit’s
opinion
was
the
belief
that
this
court’s
decision
in
oil
workers
v.
missouri
required
a
separate
distinct
rule
for
labor
cases
as
opposed
to
other
controversies
and
that
in
the
labor
controversy,
at
least
where
the
government
is
a
defendant,
a
finding
that
settlement
of
a
strike
would
moot
the
termination
of
any
issues
that
could
arise
as
a
result
of
that
strike.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
you
should
decide
it,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
you
should
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
there
are
several
reasons.
we
are
dealing
with
an
issue
here,
welfare
to
strikers,
which
has
been
presented
on
numerous
occasions
to
this
court.
it
is
probably
one
of
the
most
controversial
labor
cases
we
have
today.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
i
do
not
think
i
am
overstating
it.
i
am
looking
at
the
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
the
first
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
and
it
is
also
a
case
that,
i
submit,
you
do
not
have
to
have
a
record
apart
from
what
is
already
present
to
decide.
i
think
the
case
can
be
decided
as
a
matter
of
law.
there
is
no
need
to
take
testimony
here.
there
is
no
need
for
an
exhaustive
analysis
required.
there
is
no
need
to
do
anything
but
look
at
the
state
statutes
and
the
state
regulations
which
have
been
presented
and
are
part
of
the
appendix.
look
at
the
briefs
of
the
parties
which
this
issue
has
been
fully
briefed
to
this
court.
and
then,
i
think,
based
upon
those
two
considerations,
a
decision
is
possible.
i
get
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
this
court
has
decided
cases
where,
in
the
interest
of
economy,
it
felt
the
record
was
complete
enough
to
decide
it
even
though
if
the
lower
court
has
found
no
jurisdiction.
we
did
not
cite
any
case
there,
but
i
will
be
glad
to
supply
the
court
with
those
in
a
supplemental
brief
if
necessary.
i
think
once
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
new
jersey
state
statute,
the
general
assistance
program,
has
a
counterpart
in
every
state
in
the
united
states.
the
new
jersey
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
well,
there
are
three
statutes
involved
in
the
case.
we
have
totally
state-funded
new
jersey
plan
which
operated
during
the
first
30
days,
the
general
public
assistance
plan.
that
type
of
statute
has
its
counterpart
in
every
state
of
the
united
states.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
under
every
state
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
under
that
program,
that
is
a
state
program,
most
of
the
states
are
divided.
some
pay
strikers.
some
do
not
pay
strikers.
iowa
does
not
pay
strikers.
new
jersey
does.
maryland
does
not
pay
strikers.
massachusetts
does.
and
so
on
down
the
line.
we
also
have
a
federal,
the
aid
to
families
of
dependent
children
program.
that
was
in
effect
then,
but
it
is
not
now
in
effect
in
new
jersey.
that
is
an
optional
state
program,
the
hew
program
under
that.
the
plain
statistics
i
have
seen,
other
29
states
have
the
hew
program
at
this
time.
of
those
29
states,
there
are
approximately
seven
who
have
qualifications
to
strikers.
maryland
says
we
do
not
pay
anybody
who
is
not
eligible
for
unemployment
compensation.
kansas
and
nebraska
say
“we
do
not
pay
anybody
who
is
engaged
in
unlawful
strikes,”
as
i
believe.
some
states
say
“we
pay
people
but
we
do
not
pay
anybody
who
is
engaged
in
a
lockout.”
and,
there
are
limitations
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
i
think
the
principle
is
whether
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
what
the
principle
that
needs
to
be
decided
is
whether
the
states
can
pay
welfare
under
the
--
whether
it
is
to
people
engaged
in
any
form
of
economic
pressure
which
is
permissible
under
federal
law.
that
is
really
the
question
of
whether
that
type
of
issue
which
pervades,
i
agree
it
pervades,
state
programs,
applies
unemployment
compensation.
the
states
have
generally
many
forms
of
assistance
but
that
general
principle,
it
seems
to
me,
is
an
important
principle
that
needs
to
resolved.
and,
we
think
that
this
court
either
should
decide
it
or,
at
the
very
least,
provide
guidelines
for
the
district
court
here
if
it
does
remand
so
the
district
court
will
know
how
to
apply
a
standard
here.
this
is
an
issue
that
i
see
is
being
litigated
throughout
the
country.
at
this
time,
there
are
no
real
guidelines
as
to
how
the
lower
court
should
operate.
so,
even
if
the
court
disagrees
with
me
and
finds
that
there
is
an
incomplete
record
here
and
it
needs
a
better
record
to
decide
it,
i
would
hope
that
it
would
provide
some
assistance
to
counsel,
such
as
myself
who
has
to
litigate
this
case
throughout
the
country,
and
would
like
to
be
able
to
be
informed
whether
the
huge
test
of
the
first
circuit
is
applied
in
grinnell,
for
example.
is
that
an
appropriate
method
of
proceeding
in
this
area?
i
would
like
to
first
address
my
comments
to
the
mootness
argument
because
that
certainly
was
the
basis
for
the
decision
below,
and
the
only
basis
for
the
decision
below.
i
think
the
first
consideration
in
the
mootness
area
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
saying
that
there
should
be
a
different
mootness
test
for
labor
controversies
or
for
controversies
where
the
government
is
a
defendant
rather
than
a
plaintiff
or
whether
we
should
have
a
series
of
variables
that
will
regulate
mootness
in
cases
that
come
up
for
appellate
review
or
whether
conversely,
as
we
contend,
there
is
an
evolving
mootness
concept
most
recently
articulated
in
cases
such
as
sibron
and
moore
which
apply
to
all
cases
and
govern
for
disposition
of
all
cases
regardless
of
what
field
of
law
is
involved.
the
court
below,
at
the
outset
of
its
opinion,
seemed
to
indicate
that
that
was
the
rule.
they
articulated
four
criteria
of
mootness
which
we
think
are
appropriate.
they
said
the
test
are
whether
there
is
a
possibility
of
an
effective
judicial
decree,
second,
whether
the
controversy
is
concrete,
third,
whether
the
parties
are
under
sufficiently
adverse
context
to
ensure
effect
of
litigation
and,
finally,
apart
from
all
of
the
other
tests
whether
we
fall
within
southern
pacific,
the
moore
test,
where
this
is
a
recurring
controversy
that
is
likely
to
evade
judicial
review.
we
think
that
under
any
of
those
four
standards
in
this
case,
we
have
met
each
of
those
four
standards.
super
tire
sought
a
declaratory
judgment,
not
an
injunction.
effective
decree
which
regulates
the
state
policy
as
to
both
super
tire
and
other
employers
are
still
possible.
super
tire
is
going
to
be
affected
in
the
future
and
that
is
what
it
sought
to
have
determined,
its
rights
both
present
and
future
by
means
of
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
whether
the
state
can
engage
in
the
payments.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
this
is
a
faint
or
a
hypothetical,
or
an
abstract
controversy.
super
tire
was
harmed
on
one
occasion,
will
continue
to
be
harmed.
other
employers
have
been
harmed
and
continue
to
be
harmed.
this
is
a
need
for
advisory
opinion.
there
has
been
actual
injury
and
a
live
controversy
that
has
taken
place
and
continues
to
take
place,
and
that
is
whether
we
regard
this
as
a
challenge
to
payment
to
strikers
or
availability
to
strikers.
the
parties
continue
to
remain
in
adverse
posture.
super
tire
has
collective-bargaining
agreement
contracts
up
this
year.
the
new
negotiations
will
start.
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
strike
again.
more
than
that,
we
have
the
fact
that
over
30%
of
all
strikes
in
this
country
take
place
during
a
contract
term,
notwithstanding
those
strike
clauses
and
the
inhibitions
on
midterm
contract
strikes
of
voice
market
and
gateway
call.
the
collective-bargaining
negotiation
is
more
than
something
that
takes
place
once
every
three
years
and
stops
the
continuing
day-to-day
ongoing
relationship.
as
long
as
strike
benefits
are
payable
to
the
striker,
that
is
affected
by
the
availability
of
the
new
jersey
policies
that
we
challenge
here.
both
the
firth
circuit
in
itt
and
grinnell
cases,
the
three-judge
district
court
in
francis,
each
of
these
courts
was
confronted
by
a
mootness
contention
and
in
a
precise
same
situation
we
have
here
today.
and,
each
of
those
found
the
controversy
not
to
be
moot
and
that
there
was
continuing
relationships.
the
third
circuit
said
one
strike
with
a
length
requisite
to
raise
the
issue
has
already
occurred
and
nothing
in
the
record
suggest
the
unlikelihood
of
future
repetition.
we
think
that
same
principle
is
applicable
to
this
case.
finally,
this
case
presents
what
we
believe
to
be
a
clear
example
of
the
continuing
controversy,
the
type
of
controversy
that
might
otherwise
evade
appellate
review
of
the
type
that
this
court
found
to
fall
within
the
southern
pacific
and
such
cases
as
moore
v.
ogilvie
and
roe
v.
wade.
strikes
on
the
average,
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
lasts
11
days.
that
is
even
a
far
shorter
time
than
the
period
of
pregnancy
involved
in
roe
or
the
two-year
icc
orders
that
were
called
short-term
and
evasive
of
review
in
southern
pacific.
if
this
case
is
found
moot,
every
trailer
is
the
state
welfare
law
is
a
basis
of
preemption
in
the
country
is
likely
to
be
similarly
rendered
moot
before
we
can
have
an
appellate
decision.
an
entire
class
of
cases
would
be
denied
review
and
avenues
of
appellate
decision
will
be
denied
for
an
important
state
federal
controversy
in
an
important
preemption
area.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
the
challenge
to
new
jersey
--
it
is
not
like
unemployment
compensation.
as
far
as
i
understand
it,
you
can
bring
an
administrative
determination.
an
administrative
determination
has
been
made.
payments
are
being
dispensed
during
the
strike.
we
had
not
choice
at
the
time.
the
only
way
we
could
enjoin
those
payments
to
prohibit
the
strikers
from
getting
them
and,
thereby,
irreparably
injuring
our
situation.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
challenge
here
would
have
been,
whether
there
is
such
a
procedure
i
am
not
sure,
but
the
challenge
in
this
case
would
have
resulted
--
there
has
been
a
decision
by
the
new
jersey
department
that
administers
the
law.
the
state
attorney
general
has
said
that
is
a
correct
decision.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
suppose
we
could
take
it
to
the
new
jersey
courts,
but
the
new
jersey
courts
would
not
be
in
position
to
agree
with
us
that
what
we
are
challenging
here,
i
suppose
i
could,
is
a
violation
of
a
federal
right.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
right,
but
that
is
not
our
exclusive
form.
we
think
the
federal
courts
are
the
appropriate
place,
not
necessarily
the
only
place
but
certainly
the
appropriate
place,
for
resolving
questions
of
federal
preemption.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
presumably,
if
it
is
moot
in
the
federal
court,
it
would
be
moot
in
the
state
courts
as
well.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
this
court
has
said
on
occasion
that
mootness
of
a
preemption
issue
is
a
federal
question.
so
that
even
if
the
state
court,
for
example,
had
a
different
rule,
this
court
would
still
apply
its
own
rule.
i
think
we
could
go
to
the
new
jersey
courts.
my
feeling
was
that
at
that
time,
that
would
be
a
futile
act.
the
new
jersey
courts
have
issued
and
not
ruled
on
this
question
precisely,
but
there
certainly
have
been
determination
by
new
jersey
officials
here.
we
felt
that
this
was
presenting
squarely
an
important
federal
issue
that
ought
to
be
resolved
not
just
for
new
jersey
but
generally
and
that,
therefore,
the
appropriate
form
was
rather
than
go
to
the
new
jersey
courts
you
go
to
the
federal
courts.
and,
that
is
why
we
commenced
this
action.
now,
the
point
i
was
making
is
that
if
that
is
going
to
be
decided
as
moot,
whether
by
reason
of
the
fact
of
the
strike
itself,
then
there
is
no
way
that
we
are
ever
going
to
be
able
to
get.
we
or
any
other
employer
throughout
the
united
states
is
ever
going
to
get
review
of
the
question.
and
going
to
this
court’s
opinion
in
liner
v.
jafco,
that
is
the
exact
type
of
situation
which
should
not
occur
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
preemption
problem.
preemption
issues
are
particular
problems
where
the
court
should
be
very
careful
to
avoid
hindrances
in
the
light
of
decision.
and
that
is
what
we
think,
as
i
say,
would
be
the
result
here
and
it
would
certainly
be
the
result
with
11-day
average
strike
period
should
this
court
agree
with
the
third
circuit
on
mootness.
before
i
turn
to
the
merits,
i
just
wanted
to
address
the
oil
workers
case
which
is
the
basis
for
the
decision
below.
we
do
not
think
that
case
stands
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
distinct
or
different
or
new
rule
for
labor
controversies.
rather
we
submit
that
that
case
which
was
a
situation
involving
the
emergency
seizure
by
the
governor
of
the
state
which
was
a
discretionary
power
of
a
public
utility
confronted
in
the
labor
situation.
the
crux
of
that
case,
we
think,
are
three-fold
where
it
is
different
from
our
case,
first,
the
emergency
discretionary
speculative
nature
of
any
reoccurrence.
secondly,
the
fact
that
if
the
governor
seized
another
utility
and
there
is
no
showing
that
some
other
plaintiff
could
not
have
come
in
and
it
did
not
fall
within
the
southern
pacific
doctrine.
and
finally,
and
perhaps
most
significantly,
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
has
sought
to
enjoin
only
a
specific
act,
mainly
the
seizure
of
the
utility.
they
did
not
seek,
as
we
saw
here,
a
declaratory
judgment
which
would
affect
future
as
well
as
present
rights.
for
all
those
reasons,
we
think
that
the
defendant
and
oil
workers
perhaps
have
met
this
burden
of
showing
that
there
was
no
likelihood
or
reasonable
expectation
that
the
wrong
would
be
repeated.
in
this
case,
we
do
not
think
the
defendants
had
met
this
burden,
that
there
has
been
continuing
irreparable
injury
that
continues
to
occur
as
long
as
there
is
availability
on
the
books,
and
that
ought
to
be
a
controversy
this
court
ought
to
address.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
it
was
certainly
moot
before
it
reached
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
that
is
not
what
we
have
here.
we
had
a
controversy
that
when
it
reached
the
district
court
it
was
not
moot.
the
district
court
here
did
not
find
it
to
be
moot.
there
was
no
argument
that
it
was
moot
before
the
district
court.
the
district
court
decided
on
the
merits
entirely
against
us.
the
district
court
said
that
there
was
no
way
that
we
could
ever
prove
that
welfare
payments
to
strikers
constituted
a
substantial
interference.
it
read
the
itt
v.
minter
case
in
the
first
circuit
as
ruling
out
any
possibility
that
we
could
ever
make
proof
to
meet
the
allegations
of
our
complaint.
now,
subsequently,
the
first
circuit
in
grinnell
explicated
itt
to
say
that
is
precisely
what
it
did
not
mean
itt
to
say.
so
that
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
the
district
court’s
reading
of
itt,
which
was
the
basis
of
its
decision,
is
wrong.
it
was
the
appeal
on
that
basis,
similar
to
the
appeal
that
the
employer
took
in
grinnell
and
the
same
where
the
district
court
did
the
same
thing.
that
was
the
basis
for
appeal
and
it
was
four
days
after
the
district
court
decision
that
the
strike
settled
and,
therefore,
raised
the
mootness
controversy.
that
is
when
the
employees
returned
to
work.
now,
there
was
a
statement
made
at
the
hearing
before
the
district
court
that
the
employees
had
ratified
the
agreement
and
were
going
to
return
to
work
the
next
working
day
which
was
monday,
28th,
but
there
was
never
any
contention
or
argument
or
finding
by
the
district
court
that
that
mooted
the
controversy
at
that
point.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
merits
of
the
case
which,
again,
i
think
are
significant,
worthy
of
decision,
and
which
this
court
should
either
decide
or
provide
significant
guidelines
for
the
lower
federal
courts.
the
crux
of
our
position
is
this.
the
basis
of
federal
labor
law
is
the
voluntary
private
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
sure.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
this
was
welfare
assistance,
state
and
joint
federal-state
welfare
assistance.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
same
mootness
argument
would
arise.
the
grinnell
case
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
same
preemption
argument
was
raised
in
grinnell.
now,
i
think
that
the
unemployment
compensation
presents
a
somewhat
different
principle
in
the
sense
that
unemployment
is
a
direct
tax
on
employer,
there
is
no
need
standard.
but,
i
think
the
same
general
principle
should
govern
the
disposition
of
all
cases.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
i
do
not
think
it
is
because
in
each
case
in
grinnell
--
the
itt
involved
welfare.
grinnell
involved
unemployment
compensation.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
right,
except
in
grinnell,
it
was
not
directly
charged
to
the
employer.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
this
involves
welfare.
in
grinnell,
it
was
taken
out
of
a
general
pot
so
that
the
employer
there
did
not
have
to
pay
a
particular
share
as
opposed
to
other
states
where
it
is
directly
taxed
to
a
single
employer.
there
was
no
argument
to
that.
the
court
found
it
not
to
be
moot
because
of
southern
pacific
and
because
the
likelihood
that
there
would
be
another
strike
involved
with
the
same
employer,
and
that
is
really
the
basis
of
our
position
here.
i
want
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal,
but
i
would
like
to
spend
some
time
on
merit
argument.
the
federal
labor
law,
we
believe
the
core
of
the
federal
labor
law
is
the
voluntary
private
adjustment
of
disputes.
the
federal
labor
law
has
set
up
a
framework
which
indicates
that
certain
types
of
conduct
in
the
disposition
of
disputes
certain
types
of
economic
pressure
by
unions,
secondary
boycotts,
violence,
partial
strikes
are
forbidden.
but
where
there
is
no
such
regulation,
it
is
an
area
which
congress
has
specifically
intended
to
be
free.
congress,
in
order
to
decide
which
area
is
to
be
free
and
which
area
is
to
be
prohibited,
has
weighed
the
interest
of
employers,
of
unions,
of
public,
and
of
the
employees
involved.
where
the
area
has
been
decided
to
be
free,
where
congress
has
not
regulated
it,
then
neither
the
labor
board
in
cases
such
as
porter
or
american
ship
building,
or
the
states
in
cases
such
as
morton
may
impinge
upon
that
area.
in
morton,
for
example,
the
state
attempted
to
provide
damages
for
certain
types
of
union
economic
pressures
which
the
federal
law
has
held
to
be
lawful.
this
court
held
such
damage
awards
to
be
impermissible,
that
the
state
had
interfered
with
the
balance
struck
by
congress.
now,
we
think
that
principle
is
similarly
applicable
here.
a
state,
by
insulating
one
party
from
the
economic
disadvantages
of
the
strike,
by
ailing
its
treasury
on
the
side
of
the
union’s
economic
power
has
tipped
the
scale.
it
has
affected
the
balance.
a
striker
who
is
receiving
substantial
state
welfare
payments
is
going
to
have
a
different
result
and
a
different
determination
and
approach
negotiations
in
a
different
manner
than
the
striker
who
is
not
getting
money
from
the
state.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well
the
estimate,
according
to
the
expert
testimony
that
is
contained
in
the
appendix,
is
they
run
anywhere
from
30-70%
and
maybe
even
higher
in
cases
of
a
pre-strike
take
home
pay
for
strikers.
if
you
look
at
the
striker’s
pre-strike
take
home
pay
-
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
in
new
jersey,
the
record
does
not
contain
any
evidence.
the
testimony
we
are
prepared
to
put
on
show
that
the
benefits
in
this
case
ran
70%
or
more
pre-strike
take
home
pay
based
upon
the
wage
rates
for
the
employees
involved
and
the
level
of
assistance
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
the
employees
are
making
more
money.
it
would
have
been
a
lower
percentage.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
this
is
not
uncommon.
as
i
say,
the
expert
testimony
is
that
is
pretty
standard.
now,
this
can
increase.
you
have
got
other
forms
of
assistance,
unemployment
compensation
for
example.
it
can
also
kick
in
and
you
can
have
several
different
benefits.
i
think
the
important
point
here,
two
points
before
i
close.
the
important
point
here
is
that
new
jersey
has
created
a
special
rule
of
law
which
is
applicable
only
to
strikers.
these
are
benefits
that
would
not
be
payable
to
any
other
person
seeking
benefits
and
seeking
welfare
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
anyone
else
in
new
jersey
who
was
physically
and
mentally
capable
of
taking
a
job
is
ineligible
for
welfare
assistance
if
he
refuses
to
take
the
job.
a
striker,
by
federal
law,
has
a
federally
protected
right
to
a
job
and,
yet,
he
is
not
taking
that
job.
now,
we
submit
that
that
is
a
special
exception,
not
of
general
application
rule
as
the
state
would
encourage,
but
a
special
exception
that
has
been
carved
out
only
for
strikers
and
which
necessarily
affects
the
area
which
congress
designed
to
be
free.
the
second
thing
that
i
think
is
significant
here
is
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
not
something
that
would
have
existed
and
continued
to
exist
before
the
strike,
but
something
that
has
tilted
the
balance
right
at
the
status
quo
before
the
strike
commenced.
and
this
type
of
interference
where
the
state
has
gone
in
and
created
a
special
policy
that
applies
only
to
strikers
and
is
a
direct
interference
with
state
law
regardless
of
the
state
interest
involved.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
that
as
long
as
the
employees
are
engaged
in
a
federally
protected
activity,
it
was
a
permissible
lock
up,
then
they
ought
not
to
get
welfare
assistance
and
ought
not
to
get
any
state
help.
i
think
the
private
parties
can
go
in
and
always
assist.
the
union
is
entitled
to
use
its
strike
funds.
it
is
entitled
to
get
other
assistance.
but
once
the
state
gets
involved
in
ailing
its
economic
power
with
the
economic
power
of
the
union
itself,
then
i
think
we
would
tip
the
scale
and
that
is
really
the
crux
of
our
position.
there
has
been
much
discussion
in
the
briefs
about
the
federal
policy
on
afdc.
let
me
say
this
again.
the
afdc
program
is
no
longer
operative
in
new
jersey.
the
program
that
we
think
is
the
only
program
now
operating
are
state-funded
programs.
but
more
than
that,
in
new
jersey
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
new
jersey
withdrew
it
from
the
hew
program
of
the
afdc,
the
one
that
benefits
were
payable
under
here.
secondly,
even
if
we
go
to
the
afdc
policy
for
the
reasons
that
we
have
covered
in
our
reply
brief,
we
think
congress
has
not
sufficiently
spoken
in
that
area
to
give
any
indication
of
its
intent.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
would
like
to
spend
those
four
minutes
i
think
trying
to
unravel
some
of
the
confusion
which
mr.
skillman
perhaps
left
the
court
with.
there
is
a
clear
regulation
of
new
jersey
which
is
contained
on
page
129
of
the
appendix.
it
has
been
in
effect
since
1957
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
which
governs
the
state
welfare
programs
of
new
jersey
which
is
the
main
part
of
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
where
he
is
wrong.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
strikers
did
not
receive
benefits
in
any
substantial
amount.
under
the
adc
program,
single-parent
household,
that
the
likelihood
of
a
single
parent
being
absent
from
the
house
because
of
a
strike.
there
was
no
unemployed
provision
under
that
section.
strikers
became
eligible
for
federal
welfare
assistance
and
started
collecting
it
in
substantial
amounts
only
with
the
adaption
of
the
hew
program.
the
hew
program
is
the
key
to
federal
welfare
assistance
to
strikers.
that
program
provides
specifically
that
“anyone
who
is
involuntarily
unemployed,”
the
term
that
is
used
in
unemployment
compensation
laws
to
bar
strikers,
“and
who
does
not
refuse
work
for
good
cause,”
a
term
that
is
limited
to
physical
disabilities
or
safety
hazards,
“collects
benefits.”
and
unless
you
are
going
to
make
an
exception
for
strikers
which
is
what
new
jersey
has
done
under
its
hew
program
then
you
are,
under
federal
law,
not
eligible
for
assistance
because
“for
good
cause”
does
not
include
participating
in
a
labor
dispute
unless
you
want
to
define
it
that
way.
what
new
jersey
has
done
is
define
its
federal
program,
the
hew
program,
when
it
had
it
and
define
its
state
programs,
which
it
still
has,
consistent
with
the
regulations
contained
on
page
129
which
is
to
make
a
special
rule
for
strikers.
and,
that
is
what
we
are
attacking.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
hew
said
“we
will
approve
any
state
program
whether
it
pays
strikers
or
it
does
not
pay
strikers.”
we
are
not
going
to,
at
all,
get
involved
in
decision
under
francis.
now,
incidentally,
in
francis,
the
district
court
now
has
dissolved
that
injunction
since
hew
has
passed
new
rules
and
permit
a
male
--
to
go
ahead
and
refuse
to
pay
strikers.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
either
pay
or
not
pay.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
it
said
“we
are
not
going
to
get
involved
in
the
constitutional
question.
we
are
going
to
let
states
do
whatever
they
want
in
this.”
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
right.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
correct.
they
are
contained
in
the
appendix.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
as
far
as
hew
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
correct,
and
what
we
are
saying
here
comes
down
to
this.
the
federal
labor
law
creates,
as
a
policy,
of
not
having
governmental
participation
in
a
strike.
the
federal
welfare
law
has
a
policy
of
only
providing
money
to
those
who
were
involuntarily
unemployed.
those
two
statutes
can
be
reconciled
and
harmonized
by
not
paying
welfare
to
strikers.
but
if
you
go
ahead
and
pay
welfare
to
strikers,
then
what
you
have
done
is
interfered
with
the
labor
law
and
deviated
from
the
general
policy
of
the
welfare
law.
that
is
a
construction
of
the
law
which
serves
the
purposes
of
neither
of
the
acts,
and
conflicts
with
the
purposes
of
both.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
do
not
think
so.
the
regulation
has
been
in
effect
in
new
jersey
since
1957.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
it
is
contained
in
page
129
of
the
appendix
and
it
spells
it
out
for
the
clear
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
i
do
not,
because
the
regulation
is
clear
and
concise
and
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
do
not
think
it
is
open
to
any
possible
interpretation.
it
has
never
been
interpreted
in
any
other
way.
it
says,
specifically,
strikers
get
welfare
benefits.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
it
was
a
single-judge.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
judge
kitchen.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
it
applies
to
any
strike
that
is
consistent
with
a
strike
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
am
sorry.
i
meant
my
interpretation
rather
than
the
regulation.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
that
is
what
the
state
should
not
get
into.
the
state
should
not
get
into
the
policy
of
saying
“we
are
going
to
pay
some
strikers
but
not
other
strikers.
we
are
going
to
pay
people
who
are
in
lockouts
but
not
in
other
times
of
disputes.”
that
is
the
kind
of
decision
that
ought
to
be
made
under
federal
labor
law
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
not
by
state
agencies.
i
see
my
time
is
up,
i
think.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
two
issues
for
decision.
first,
our
substantial
state
welfare
subsidy
is
to
strikers
which
are
payable
solely
because
of
the
strike
and
impermissible
intrusion
upon
the
national
labor
policy
of
free
collective-bargaining.
and
second,
whether
declaratory
judgment
action
to
resolve
that
important
issue
is
rendered
moot
when
the
particular
strike,
during
which
the
payments
are
made
is
settled.
notwithstanding
that
such
payments
continue
and
continue
to
have
an
effect
on
both
the
same
employer
and
other
employers
in
the
state.
this
case
arose
in
may
14,
1971
when
employees
of
super
tire
co.,
who
are
represented
by
respondent
teamsters
local
676,
struck
to
obtain
an
agreement
as
to
their
proposals
for
a
new
collective-bargaining
agreement.
during
the
first
30
days
of
that
strike,
many
of
the
strikers
received
public
welfare
assistance
under
a
totally
state-funded
program,
new
jersey’s
general
public
assistance
program.
subsequently,
after
a
30-day
waiting
period
had
elapsed,
the
strikers
became
eligible
for
and
received
assistance
under
a
joint
federal-state
program,
aid
to
families
of
dependent
children.
the
aided
program
is
no
longer
in
effect
in
new
jersey
and
has
now
been
replaced
by
another
totally
state-funded
program,
aid
to
families
of
the
working
poor.
this
action
was
filed
on
june
10,
1971
after
the
strike
had
continued
for
approximately
three
weeks.
it
sought
both
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
the
crux
of
the
case
was
the
issue
of
whether
the
supremacy
clause
embodying
the
federal
labor
policy
precluded
the
state
and
federal
welfare
subsidies
to
strikers.
the
argument
was
that
such
payments
and
the
availability
of
such
payments
violated
the
national
labor
policy
of
free
collective-bargaining.
this
issue
came
before
the
court
on
june
24,
1971.
the
company
argued
two
things.
first,
it
argued
that,
as
a
manner
of
law,
it
was
correct
that
there
was
a
substantial
state
interference
by
the
statute
itself,
by
the
regulations
itself
and,
therefore,
that
was
an
impermissible
intrusion
of
free
and
collective-bargaining.
it
further
offered
to
demonstrate
through
the
testimony
of
state
officials
who
were
present,
through
the
testimony
of
expert
witnesses
who
were
present
that
there
was
substantial
interference
in
this
particular
case
with
the
collective-bargaining
relations
between
super
tire
and
teamster
local
676.
the
district
court,
however,
orally
dismissed
the
case
under
rule
12b6
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
four
days
later,
on
june
28,
the
strike
ended.
the
employees
returned
to
work.
the
company,
there
upon,
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
which,
in
a
lengthy
divided
opinion,
dismissed
the
appeal
as
moot.
the
basis
for
the
third
circuit’s
opinion
was
the
belief
that
this
court’s
decision
in
oil
workers
v.
missouri
required
a
separate
distinct
rule
for
labor
cases
as
opposed
to
other
controversies
and
that
in
the
labor
controversy,
at
least
where
the
government
is
a
defendant,
a
finding
that
settlement
of
a
strike
would
moot
the
termination
of
any
issues
that
could
arise
as
a
result
of
that
strike.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
you
should
decide
it,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
think
you
should
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
there
are
several
reasons.
we
are
dealing
with
an
issue
here,
welfare
to
strikers,
which
has
been
presented
on
numerous
occasions
to
this
court.
it
is
probably
one
of
the
most
controversial
labor
cases
we
have
today.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
i
do
not
think
i
am
overstating
it.
i
am
looking
at
the
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
the
first
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
and
it
is
also
a
case
that,
i
submit,
you
do
not
have
to
have
a
record
apart
from
what
is
already
present
to
decide.
i
think
the
case
can
be
decided
as
a
matter
of
law.
there
is
no
need
to
take
testimony
here.
there
is
no
need
for
an
exhaustive
analysis
required.
there
is
no
need
to
do
anything
but
look
at
the
state
statutes
and
the
state
regulations
which
have
been
presented
and
are
part
of
the
appendix.
look
at
the
briefs
of
the
parties
which
this
issue
has
been
fully
briefed
to
this
court.
and
then,
i
think,
based
upon
those
two
considerations,
a
decision
is
possible.
i
get
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
this
court
has
decided
cases
where,
in
the
interest
of
economy,
it
felt
the
record
was
complete
enough
to
decide
it
even
though
if
the
lower
court
has
found
no
jurisdiction.
we
did
not
cite
any
case
there,
but
i
will
be
glad
to
supply
the
court
with
those
in
a
supplemental
brief
if
necessary.
i
think
once
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
new
jersey
state
statute,
the
general
assistance
program,
has
a
counterpart
in
every
state
in
the
united
states.
the
new
jersey
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
well,
there
are
three
statutes
involved
in
the
case.
we
have
totally
state-funded
new
jersey
plan
which
operated
during
the
first
30
days,
the
general
public
assistance
plan.
that
type
of
statute
has
its
counterpart
in
every
state
of
the
united
states.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
under
every
state
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
under
that
program,
that
is
a
state
program,
most
of
the
states
are
divided.
some
pay
strikers.
some
do
not
pay
strikers.
iowa
does
not
pay
strikers.
new
jersey
does.
maryland
does
not
pay
strikers.
massachusetts
does.
and
so
on
down
the
line.
we
also
have
a
federal,
the
aid
to
families
of
dependent
children
program.
that
was
in
effect
then,
but
it
is
not
now
in
effect
in
new
jersey.
that
is
an
optional
state
program,
the
hew
program
under
that.
the
plain
statistics
i
have
seen,
other
29
states
have
the
hew
program
at
this
time.
of
those
29
states,
there
are
approximately
seven
who
have
qualifications
to
strikers.
maryland
says
we
do
not
pay
anybody
who
is
not
eligible
for
unemployment
compensation.
kansas
and
nebraska
say
“we
do
not
pay
anybody
who
is
engaged
in
unlawful
strikes,”
as
i
believe.
some
states
say
“we
pay
people
but
we
do
not
pay
anybody
who
is
engaged
in
a
lockout.”
and,
there
are
limitations
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
i
think
the
principle
is
whether
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
what
the
principle
that
needs
to
be
decided
is
whether
the
states
can
pay
welfare
under
the
--
whether
it
is
to
people
engaged
in
any
form
of
economic
pressure
which
is
permissible
under
federal
law.
that
is
really
the
question
of
whether
that
type
of
issue
which
pervades,
i
agree
it
pervades,
state
programs,
applies
unemployment
compensation.
the
states
have
generally
many
forms
of
assistance
but
that
general
principle,
it
seems
to
me,
is
an
important
principle
that
needs
to
resolved.
and,
we
think
that
this
court
either
should
decide
it
or,
at
the
very
least,
provide
guidelines
for
the
district
court
here
if
it
does
remand
so
the
district
court
will
know
how
to
apply
a
standard
here.
this
is
an
issue
that
i
see
is
being
litigated
throughout
the
country.
at
this
time,
there
are
no
real
guidelines
as
to
how
the
lower
court
should
operate.
so,
even
if
the
court
disagrees
with
me
and
finds
that
there
is
an
incomplete
record
here
and
it
needs
a
better
record
to
decide
it,
i
would
hope
that
it
would
provide
some
assistance
to
counsel,
such
as
myself
who
has
to
litigate
this
case
throughout
the
country,
and
would
like
to
be
able
to
be
informed
whether
the
huge
test
of
the
first
circuit
is
applied
in
grinnell,
for
example.
is
that
an
appropriate
method
of
proceeding
in
this
area?
i
would
like
to
first
address
my
comments
to
the
mootness
argument
because
that
certainly
was
the
basis
for
the
decision
below,
and
the
only
basis
for
the
decision
below.
i
think
the
first
consideration
in
the
mootness
area
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
saying
that
there
should
be
a
different
mootness
test
for
labor
controversies
or
for
controversies
where
the
government
is
a
defendant
rather
than
a
plaintiff
or
whether
we
should
have
a
series
of
variables
that
will
regulate
mootness
in
cases
that
come
up
for
appellate
review
or
whether
conversely,
as
we
contend,
there
is
an
evolving
mootness
concept
most
recently
articulated
in
cases
such
as
sibron
and
moore
which
apply
to
all
cases
and
govern
for
disposition
of
all
cases
regardless
of
what
field
of
law
is
involved.
the
court
below,
at
the
outset
of
its
opinion,
seemed
to
indicate
that
that
was
the
rule.
they
articulated
four
criteria
of
mootness
which
we
think
are
appropriate.
they
said
the
test
are
whether
there
is
a
possibility
of
an
effective
judicial
decree,
second,
whether
the
controversy
is
concrete,
third,
whether
the
parties
are
under
sufficiently
adverse
context
to
ensure
effect
of
litigation
and,
finally,
apart
from
all
of
the
other
tests
whether
we
fall
within
southern
pacific,
the
moore
test,
where
this
is
a
recurring
controversy
that
is
likely
to
evade
judicial
review.
we
think
that
under
any
of
those
four
standards
in
this
case,
we
have
met
each
of
those
four
standards.
super
tire
sought
a
declaratory
judgment,
not
an
injunction.
effective
decree
which
regulates
the
state
policy
as
to
both
super
tire
and
other
employers
are
still
possible.
super
tire
is
going
to
be
affected
in
the
future
and
that
is
what
it
sought
to
have
determined,
its
rights
both
present
and
future
by
means
of
a
declaratory
judgment
as
to
whether
the
state
can
engage
in
the
payments.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
this
is
a
faint
or
a
hypothetical,
or
an
abstract
controversy.
super
tire
was
harmed
on
one
occasion,
will
continue
to
be
harmed.
other
employers
have
been
harmed
and
continue
to
be
harmed.
this
is
a
need
for
advisory
opinion.
there
has
been
actual
injury
and
a
live
controversy
that
has
taken
place
and
continues
to
take
place,
and
that
is
whether
we
regard
this
as
a
challenge
to
payment
to
strikers
or
availability
to
strikers.
the
parties
continue
to
remain
in
adverse
posture.
super
tire
has
collective-bargaining
agreement
contracts
up
this
year.
the
new
negotiations
will
start.
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
strike
again.
more
than
that,
we
have
the
fact
that
over
30%
of
all
strikes
in
this
country
take
place
during
a
contract
term,
notwithstanding
those
strike
clauses
and
the
inhibitions
on
midterm
contract
strikes
of
voice
market
and
gateway
call.
the
collective-bargaining
negotiation
is
more
than
something
that
takes
place
once
every
three
years
and
stops
the
continuing
day-to-day
ongoing
relationship.
as
long
as
strike
benefits
are
payable
to
the
striker,
that
is
affected
by
the
availability
of
the
new
jersey
policies
that
we
challenge
here.
both
the
firth
circuit
in
itt
and
grinnell
cases,
the
three-judge
district
court
in
francis,
each
of
these
courts
was
confronted
by
a
mootness
contention
and
in
a
precise
same
situation
we
have
here
today.
and,
each
of
those
found
the
controversy
not
to
be
moot
and
that
there
was
continuing
relationships.
the
third
circuit
said
one
strike
with
a
length
requisite
to
raise
the
issue
has
already
occurred
and
nothing
in
the
record
suggest
the
unlikelihood
of
future
repetition.
we
think
that
same
principle
is
applicable
to
this
case.
finally,
this
case
presents
what
we
believe
to
be
a
clear
example
of
the
continuing
controversy,
the
type
of
controversy
that
might
otherwise
evade
appellate
review
of
the
type
that
this
court
found
to
fall
within
the
southern
pacific
and
such
cases
as
moore
v.
ogilvie
and
roe
v.
wade.
strikes
on
the
average,
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
lasts
11
days.
that
is
even
a
far
shorter
time
than
the
period
of
pregnancy
involved
in
roe
or
the
two-year
icc
orders
that
were
called
short-term
and
evasive
of
review
in
southern
pacific.
if
this
case
is
found
moot,
every
trailer
is
the
state
welfare
law
is
a
basis
of
preemption
in
the
country
is
likely
to
be
similarly
rendered
moot
before
we
can
have
an
appellate
decision.
an
entire
class
of
cases
would
be
denied
review
and
avenues
of
appellate
decision
will
be
denied
for
an
important
state
federal
controversy
in
an
important
preemption
area.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
the
challenge
to
new
jersey
--
it
is
not
like
unemployment
compensation.
as
far
as
i
understand
it,
you
can
bring
an
administrative
determination.
an
administrative
determination
has
been
made.
payments
are
being
dispensed
during
the
strike.
we
had
not
choice
at
the
time.
the
only
way
we
could
enjoin
those
payments
to
prohibit
the
strikers
from
getting
them
and,
thereby,
irreparably
injuring
our
situation.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
challenge
here
would
have
been,
whether
there
is
such
a
procedure
i
am
not
sure,
but
the
challenge
in
this
case
would
have
resulted
--
there
has
been
a
decision
by
the
new
jersey
department
that
administers
the
law.
the
state
attorney
general
has
said
that
is
a
correct
decision.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
suppose
we
could
take
it
to
the
new
jersey
courts,
but
the
new
jersey
courts
would
not
be
in
position
to
agree
with
us
that
what
we
are
challenging
here,
i
suppose
i
could,
is
a
violation
of
a
federal
right.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
right,
but
that
is
not
our
exclusive
form.
we
think
the
federal
courts
are
the
appropriate
place,
not
necessarily
the
only
place
but
certainly
the
appropriate
place,
for
resolving
questions
of
federal
preemption.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
presumably,
if
it
is
moot
in
the
federal
court,
it
would
be
moot
in
the
state
courts
as
well.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
this
court
has
said
on
occasion
that
mootness
of
a
preemption
issue
is
a
federal
question.
so
that
even
if
the
state
court,
for
example,
had
a
different
rule,
this
court
would
still
apply
its
own
rule.
i
think
we
could
go
to
the
new
jersey
courts.
my
feeling
was
that
at
that
time,
that
would
be
a
futile
act.
the
new
jersey
courts
have
issued
and
not
ruled
on
this
question
precisely,
but
there
certainly
have
been
determination
by
new
jersey
officials
here.
we
felt
that
this
was
presenting
squarely
an
important
federal
issue
that
ought
to
be
resolved
not
just
for
new
jersey
but
generally
and
that,
therefore,
the
appropriate
form
was
rather
than
go
to
the
new
jersey
courts
you
go
to
the
federal
courts.
and,
that
is
why
we
commenced
this
action.
now,
the
point
i
was
making
is
that
if
that
is
going
to
be
decided
as
moot,
whether
by
reason
of
the
fact
of
the
strike
itself,
then
there
is
no
way
that
we
are
ever
going
to
be
able
to
get.
we
or
any
other
employer
throughout
the
united
states
is
ever
going
to
get
review
of
the
question.
and
going
to
this
court’s
opinion
in
liner
v.
jafco,
that
is
the
exact
type
of
situation
which
should
not
occur
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
preemption
problem.
preemption
issues
are
particular
problems
where
the
court
should
be
very
careful
to
avoid
hindrances
in
the
light
of
decision.
and
that
is
what
we
think,
as
i
say,
would
be
the
result
here
and
it
would
certainly
be
the
result
with
11-day
average
strike
period
should
this
court
agree
with
the
third
circuit
on
mootness.
before
i
turn
to
the
merits,
i
just
wanted
to
address
the
oil
workers
case
which
is
the
basis
for
the
decision
below.
we
do
not
think
that
case
stands
for
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
distinct
or
different
or
new
rule
for
labor
controversies.
rather
we
submit
that
that
case
which
was
a
situation
involving
the
emergency
seizure
by
the
governor
of
the
state
which
was
a
discretionary
power
of
a
public
utility
confronted
in
the
labor
situation.
the
crux
of
that
case,
we
think,
are
three-fold
where
it
is
different
from
our
case,
first,
the
emergency
discretionary
speculative
nature
of
any
reoccurrence.
secondly,
the
fact
that
if
the
governor
seized
another
utility
and
there
is
no
showing
that
some
other
plaintiff
could
not
have
come
in
and
it
did
not
fall
within
the
southern
pacific
doctrine.
and
finally,
and
perhaps
most
significantly,
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
has
sought
to
enjoin
only
a
specific
act,
mainly
the
seizure
of
the
utility.
they
did
not
seek,
as
we
saw
here,
a
declaratory
judgment
which
would
affect
future
as
well
as
present
rights.
for
all
those
reasons,
we
think
that
the
defendant
and
oil
workers
perhaps
have
met
this
burden
of
showing
that
there
was
no
likelihood
or
reasonable
expectation
that
the
wrong
would
be
repeated.
in
this
case,
we
do
not
think
the
defendants
had
met
this
burden,
that
there
has
been
continuing
irreparable
injury
that
continues
to
occur
as
long
as
there
is
availability
on
the
books,
and
that
ought
to
be
a
controversy
this
court
ought
to
address.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
it
was
certainly
moot
before
it
reached
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
that
is
not
what
we
have
here.
we
had
a
controversy
that
when
it
reached
the
district
court
it
was
not
moot.
the
district
court
here
did
not
find
it
to
be
moot.
there
was
no
argument
that
it
was
moot
before
the
district
court.
the
district
court
decided
on
the
merits
entirely
against
us.
the
district
court
said
that
there
was
no
way
that
we
could
ever
prove
that
welfare
payments
to
strikers
constituted
a
substantial
interference.
it
read
the
itt
v.
minter
case
in
the
first
circuit
as
ruling
out
any
possibility
that
we
could
ever
make
proof
to
meet
the
allegations
of
our
complaint.
now,
subsequently,
the
first
circuit
in
grinnell
explicated
itt
to
say
that
is
precisely
what
it
did
not
mean
itt
to
say.
so
that
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
the
district
court’s
reading
of
itt,
which
was
the
basis
of
its
decision,
is
wrong.
it
was
the
appeal
on
that
basis,
similar
to
the
appeal
that
the
employer
took
in
grinnell
and
the
same
where
the
district
court
did
the
same
thing.
that
was
the
basis
for
appeal
and
it
was
four
days
after
the
district
court
decision
that
the
strike
settled
and,
therefore,
raised
the
mootness
controversy.
that
is
when
the
employees
returned
to
work.
now,
there
was
a
statement
made
at
the
hearing
before
the
district
court
that
the
employees
had
ratified
the
agreement
and
were
going
to
return
to
work
the
next
working
day
which
was
monday,
28th,
but
there
was
never
any
contention
or
argument
or
finding
by
the
district
court
that
that
mooted
the
controversy
at
that
point.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
merits
of
the
case
which,
again,
i
think
are
significant,
worthy
of
decision,
and
which
this
court
should
either
decide
or
provide
significant
guidelines
for
the
lower
federal
courts.
the
crux
of
our
position
is
this.
the
basis
of
federal
labor
law
is
the
voluntary
private
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
sure.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
this
was
welfare
assistance,
state
and
joint
federal-state
welfare
assistance.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
same
mootness
argument
would
arise.
the
grinnell
case
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
same
preemption
argument
was
raised
in
grinnell.
now,
i
think
that
the
unemployment
compensation
presents
a
somewhat
different
principle
in
the
sense
that
unemployment
is
a
direct
tax
on
employer,
there
is
no
need
standard.
but,
i
think
the
same
general
principle
should
govern
the
disposition
of
all
cases.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
i
do
not
think
it
is
because
in
each
case
in
grinnell
--
the
itt
involved
welfare.
grinnell
involved
unemployment
compensation.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
right,
except
in
grinnell,
it
was
not
directly
charged
to
the
employer.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
this
involves
welfare.
in
grinnell,
it
was
taken
out
of
a
general
pot
so
that
the
employer
there
did
not
have
to
pay
a
particular
share
as
opposed
to
other
states
where
it
is
directly
taxed
to
a
single
employer.
there
was
no
argument
to
that.
the
court
found
it
not
to
be
moot
because
of
southern
pacific
and
because
the
likelihood
that
there
would
be
another
strike
involved
with
the
same
employer,
and
that
is
really
the
basis
of
our
position
here.
i
want
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal,
but
i
would
like
to
spend
some
time
on
merit
argument.
the
federal
labor
law,
we
believe
the
core
of
the
federal
labor
law
is
the
voluntary
private
adjustment
of
disputes.
the
federal
labor
law
has
set
up
a
framework
which
indicates
that
certain
types
of
conduct
in
the
disposition
of
disputes
certain
types
of
economic
pressure
by
unions,
secondary
boycotts,
violence,
partial
strikes
are
forbidden.
but
where
there
is
no
such
regulation,
it
is
an
area
which
congress
has
specifically
intended
to
be
free.
congress,
in
order
to
decide
which
area
is
to
be
free
and
which
area
is
to
be
prohibited,
has
weighed
the
interest
of
employers,
of
unions,
of
public,
and
of
the
employees
involved.
where
the
area
has
been
decided
to
be
free,
where
congress
has
not
regulated
it,
then
neither
the
labor
board
in
cases
such
as
porter
or
american
ship
building,
or
the
states
in
cases
such
as
morton
may
impinge
upon
that
area.
in
morton,
for
example,
the
state
attempted
to
provide
damages
for
certain
types
of
union
economic
pressures
which
the
federal
law
has
held
to
be
lawful.
this
court
held
such
damage
awards
to
be
impermissible,
that
the
state
had
interfered
with
the
balance
struck
by
congress.
now,
we
think
that
principle
is
similarly
applicable
here.
a
state,
by
insulating
one
party
from
the
economic
disadvantages
of
the
strike,
by
ailing
its
treasury
on
the
side
of
the
union’s
economic
power
has
tipped
the
scale.
it
has
affected
the
balance.
a
striker
who
is
receiving
substantial
state
welfare
payments
is
going
to
have
a
different
result
and
a
different
determination
and
approach
negotiations
in
a
different
manner
than
the
striker
who
is
not
getting
money
from
the
state.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well
the
estimate,
according
to
the
expert
testimony
that
is
contained
in
the
appendix,
is
they
run
anywhere
from
30-70%
and
maybe
even
higher
in
cases
of
a
pre-strike
take
home
pay
for
strikers.
if
you
look
at
the
striker’s
pre-strike
take
home
pay
-
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
in
new
jersey,
the
record
does
not
contain
any
evidence.
the
testimony
we
are
prepared
to
put
on
show
that
the
benefits
in
this
case
ran
70%
or
more
pre-strike
take
home
pay
based
upon
the
wage
rates
for
the
employees
involved
and
the
level
of
assistance
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
the
employees
are
making
more
money.
it
would
have
been
a
lower
percentage.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
this
is
not
uncommon.
as
i
say,
the
expert
testimony
is
that
is
pretty
standard.
now,
this
can
increase.
you
have
got
other
forms
of
assistance,
unemployment
compensation
for
example.
it
can
also
kick
in
and
you
can
have
several
different
benefits.
i
think
the
important
point
here,
two
points
before
i
close.
the
important
point
here
is
that
new
jersey
has
created
a
special
rule
of
law
which
is
applicable
only
to
strikers.
these
are
benefits
that
would
not
be
payable
to
any
other
person
seeking
benefits
and
seeking
welfare
in
the
state
of
new
jersey.
anyone
else
in
new
jersey
who
was
physically
and
mentally
capable
of
taking
a
job
is
ineligible
for
welfare
assistance
if
he
refuses
to
take
the
job.
a
striker,
by
federal
law,
has
a
federally
protected
right
to
a
job
and,
yet,
he
is
not
taking
that
job.
now,
we
submit
that
that
is
a
special
exception,
not
of
general
application
rule
as
the
state
would
encourage,
but
a
special
exception
that
has
been
carved
out
only
for
strikers
and
which
necessarily
affects
the
area
which
congress
designed
to
be
free.
the
second
thing
that
i
think
is
significant
here
is
that
what
we
are
talking
about
is
not
something
that
would
have
existed
and
continued
to
exist
before
the
strike,
but
something
that
has
tilted
the
balance
right
at
the
status
quo
before
the
strike
commenced.
and
this
type
of
interference
where
the
state
has
gone
in
and
created
a
special
policy
that
applies
only
to
strikers
and
is
a
direct
interference
with
state
law
regardless
of
the
state
interest
involved.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
that
as
long
as
the
employees
are
engaged
in
a
federally
protected
activity,
it
was
a
permissible
lock
up,
then
they
ought
not
to
get
welfare
assistance
and
ought
not
to
get
any
state
help.
i
think
the
private
parties
can
go
in
and
always
assist.
the
union
is
entitled
to
use
its
strike
funds.
it
is
entitled
to
get
other
assistance.
but
once
the
state
gets
involved
in
ailing
its
economic
power
with
the
economic
power
of
the
union
itself,
then
i
think
we
would
tip
the
scale
and
that
is
really
the
crux
of
our
position.
there
has
been
much
discussion
in
the
briefs
about
the
federal
policy
on
afdc.
let
me
say
this
again.
the
afdc
program
is
no
longer
operative
in
new
jersey.
the
program
that
we
think
is
the
only
program
now
operating
are
state-funded
programs.
but
more
than
that,
in
new
jersey
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
new
jersey
withdrew
it
from
the
hew
program
of
the
afdc,
the
one
that
benefits
were
payable
under
here.
secondly,
even
if
we
go
to
the
afdc
policy
for
the
reasons
that
we
have
covered
in
our
reply
brief,
we
think
congress
has
not
sufficiently
spoken
in
that
area
to
give
any
indication
of
its
intent.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
would
like
to
spend
those
four
minutes
i
think
trying
to
unravel
some
of
the
confusion
which
mr.
skillman
perhaps
left
the
court
with.
there
is
a
clear
regulation
of
new
jersey
which
is
contained
on
page
129
of
the
appendix.
it
has
been
in
effect
since
1957
in
the
state
of
new
jersey
which
governs
the
state
welfare
programs
of
new
jersey
which
is
the
main
part
of
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
where
he
is
wrong.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
strikers
did
not
receive
benefits
in
any
substantial
amount.
under
the
adc
program,
single-parent
household,
that
the
likelihood
of
a
single
parent
being
absent
from
the
house
because
of
a
strike.
there
was
no
unemployed
provision
under
that
section.
strikers
became
eligible
for
federal
welfare
assistance
and
started
collecting
it
in
substantial
amounts
only
with
the
adaption
of
the
hew
program.
the
hew
program
is
the
key
to
federal
welfare
assistance
to
strikers.
that
program
provides
specifically
that
“anyone
who
is
involuntarily
unemployed,”
the
term
that
is
used
in
unemployment
compensation
laws
to
bar
strikers,
“and
who
does
not
refuse
work
for
good
cause,”
a
term
that
is
limited
to
physical
disabilities
or
safety
hazards,
“collects
benefits.”
and
unless
you
are
going
to
make
an
exception
for
strikers
which
is
what
new
jersey
has
done
under
its
hew
program
then
you
are,
under
federal
law,
not
eligible
for
assistance
because
“for
good
cause”
does
not
include
participating
in
a
labor
dispute
unless
you
want
to
define
it
that
way.
what
new
jersey
has
done
is
define
its
federal
program,
the
hew
program,
when
it
had
it
and
define
its
state
programs,
which
it
still
has,
consistent
with
the
regulations
contained
on
page
129
which
is
to
make
a
special
rule
for
strikers.
and,
that
is
what
we
are
attacking.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
hew
said
“we
will
approve
any
state
program
whether
it
pays
strikers
or
it
does
not
pay
strikers.”
we
are
not
going
to,
at
all,
get
involved
in
decision
under
francis.
now,
incidentally,
in
francis,
the
district
court
now
has
dissolved
that
injunction
since
hew
has
passed
new
rules
and
permit
a
male
--
to
go
ahead
and
refuse
to
pay
strikers.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
either
pay
or
not
pay.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
it
said
“we
are
not
going
to
get
involved
in
the
constitutional
question.
we
are
going
to
let
states
do
whatever
they
want
in
this.”
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
right.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
correct.
they
are
contained
in
the
appendix.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
as
far
as
hew
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that
is
correct,
and
what
we
are
saying
here
comes
down
to
this.
the
federal
labor
law
creates,
as
a
policy,
of
not
having
governmental
participation
in
a
strike.
the
federal
welfare
law
has
a
policy
of
only
providing
money
to
those
who
were
involuntarily
unemployed.
those
two
statutes
can
be
reconciled
and
harmonized
by
not
paying
welfare
to
strikers.
but
if
you
go
ahead
and
pay
welfare
to
strikers,
then
what
you
have
done
is
interfered
with
the
labor
law
and
deviated
from
the
general
policy
of
the
welfare
law.
that
is
a
construction
of
the
law
which
serves
the
purposes
of
neither
of
the
acts,
and
conflicts
with
the
purposes
of
both.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
do
not
think
so.
the
regulation
has
been
in
effect
in
new
jersey
since
1957.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
it
is
contained
in
page
129
of
the
appendix
and
it
spells
it
out
for
the
clear
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
i
do
not,
because
the
regulation
is
clear
and
concise
and
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
do
not
think
it
is
open
to
any
possible
interpretation.
it
has
never
been
interpreted
in
any
other
way.
it
says,
specifically,
strikers
get
welfare
benefits.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
it
was
a
single-judge.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
judge
kitchen.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
it
applies
to
any
strike
that
is
consistent
with
a
strike
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
am
sorry.
i
meant
my
interpretation
rather
than
the
regulation.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
that
is
what
the
state
should
not
get
into.
the
state
should
not
get
into
the
policy
of
saying
“we
are
going
to
pay
some
strikers
but
not
other
strikers.
we
are
going
to
pay
people
who
are
in
lockouts
but
not
in
other
times
of
disputes.”
that
is
the
kind
of
decision
that
ought
to
be
made
under
federal
labor
law
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
not
by
state
agencies.
i
see
my
time
is
up,
i
think.
