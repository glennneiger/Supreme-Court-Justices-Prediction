we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
73-473,
taylor
against
hayes.
mr.
sedler,
you
may
proceed
when
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
existence
of
this
summary
contempt
power
in
some
way
explains
or
excuses
the
conduct
of
this
lawyer
in
this
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
doesn't
this
provoke
him
to
act
that
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
your
client
moved
for
a
mistrial?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
on
this
ground?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
sedler,
let
me
go
back
to
response
you
gave
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
if
i
followed
you.
what
you
said
was
that
the
right
to
appeal
is
not
a
genuine
and
meaningful
remedy
if
the
court
has
overreached.
you
did
not
fill
in
beyond
that.
i
might
take
it
that
your
view
is
that
since
the
right
to
appeal
for
the
overreaching
or
arbitrariness
of
the
judge
is
not
a
meaningful
remedy
that
then
the
lawyer
is
free
to
try
to
out
shout
the
judge?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
what
are
the
alternatives?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
think
it
is
not
contempt
if
after
a
judge,
the
trial
judge
has
ruled
and
announced
his
ruling
if
the
lawyer
insists
upon
continuing
argument
of
the
ruling
which
has
been
closed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
sedler.
mr.
triplett.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
you’re
saying
there
really
is
no
more
than
that
they
would
act
on
the
full
record?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
triplett,
let
me
back
a
little
bit
for
something
you
touched
on
in
response
to
a
question
partly
from
mr.
justice
stewart.
at
what
stage
and
as
to
which
of
the
particular
episodes
did
mr.
taylor
respond
saying
that
his
conduct
was
accounted
for
by
the
fact
there
had
been
a
funeral,
a
wedding
and
a
lot
of
other
things.
was
that
--
were
you
drawing
together
a
whole
series
of
things?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
are
you
now?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no
question.
by
the
way
in
the
groppi
case,
that
was
wisconsin
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
groppi
case,
i
think
the
opinion
indicated
rather
clearly
that
had
they
seized
him
immediately
and
proceeded
with
contempt,
there
might
have
been
a
different
result.
it
was
because
groppi
went
away
and
then
without
notice
to
him.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
triplett.
you
