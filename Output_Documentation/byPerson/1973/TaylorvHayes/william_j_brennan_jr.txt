justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
gather,
mr.
sedler,
to
that
extent
your
position
except
it
would
invalidate
rule
42
(a),
would
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
also
the
underlying
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
thought
the
federal
statute
dealt
by
definition,
doesn’t
it,
with
what
is
a
criminal
contempt?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
alright.
so
what
you
are
saying
is
you’d
invalidate
only
42
(a)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
all
contempts
would
have
to
--
the
process
would
be
under
42
(b)?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me
mr.
sedler,
if
you
follow
a
rule
42,
if
that’s
what
you
say
constitutionally
would
be
required
42
(b)
procedure
whether
state
or
federal,
what
issues
would
be
determined
at
the
hearing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
see,
the
judge
in
whose
presence
the
conduct
was
committed
could
not
say
that’s
contempt
and
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
he
wouldn’t
cite
just
for
determination
whether
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right
and
you’d
have
a
--
you’re
coming
now
that
you’d
say
that
the
constitution
would
also
require
a
jury
trial?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
(voice
overlap)
only
ten
days
would
be
substantial
imprisonment
for
a
lawyer?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
would
think
so.
