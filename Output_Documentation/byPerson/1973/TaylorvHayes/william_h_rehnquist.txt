justice
william

rehnquist
mr.
sedler
you
say
that
the
summary
contempt
power
makes
a
lawyer
tend
to
pull
his
punches
up.
i
take
it
if
the
judge
is
going
to
retain
any
control
of
the
proceeding,
there
has
got
to
be
something
that
makes
counsel
for
each
side
to
pull
his
punches
on
occasion,
the
court
has
indicated
their
particular
line
of
questioning
will
be
prohibited
or
something
like
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
does
he
maintain
that
control?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
counsel
doesn’t
follow
his
rule?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
counsel
continues
to
argue?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
no
punishment
can
be
meted
out
during
the
course
of
those
proceedings?
justice
william

mr.
sedler,
i
think
the
way
many
of
us
learned
to
practice
law
was
that
if
the
trial
judge
was
unfair
to
you
or
you
felt
that
was
hostile
to
you,
you
felt
you
have
to
abide
his
rulings,
your
remedy
was
by
appeal
that
you
could
get
that
reversed
on
appeal?
