and
how
would
the
court
maintain
decorum?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
would
the
judge
maintain
decorum
in
his
courtroom?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that’s
enough?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
aren’t
you
right
now
pretty
being
hunky
you
don’t
need
that
for
this,
do
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
doesn’t
he
know
that
when
he
is
admitted
to
the
bar?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn’t
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean
when
he
takes
his
oath?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
knows
that
if
he
gets
out
of
line
he
is
going
to
be
punished.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no.
i
didn’t
say
that.
as
he
knows
he
is
going
to
be
punished.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
you
say
by
putting
additional
one
you
are
saying,
we’ll
try
you
later.
so
i
mean
now
he
has
got
two
warnings.
well,
meanwhile
you
are
going
to
get
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
the
two
warnings
would
be
enough,
the
first
was
not
enough.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
you
want
the
lawyer
to
hold
judge
in
contempt?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
want
to
give
him
that
power?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
suppose
a
lawyer
is
contemptuous
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state,
what
court
would
sit
on
that
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no
he
stood
up
in
open
court
and
just
did
all
the
things
you
and
i
know
can
possibly
be
done,
an
absolute
contempt
to
the
court.
you
say
some
other
court
should
do
it,
now
what
other
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that
would
be
the
protection
that
the
supreme
court
would
get?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
suppose
somebody
is
contemptuous
in
this
court,
now
what
court
will
operate
then?
all
i’m
talking
about,
why
do
you
say
that
all
summary
contempts
must
be
washed
out
with
one
stroke
of
the
pan,
why
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
triplett,
when
the
bar
association
considers
this
case,
will
they
consider
it
at
one
six
months
or
more?
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
how
many
counts?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
would
be
considered
guilty
on
all
the
accounts.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
phrase
by
“now,
i
got
you?”
[attempt
to
laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
judge
saying
“now,
i
got
you?”
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that
might
not
be
the
exact
words,
but
it’s
close
to
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
have
to
find
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
what
we
are
talking
about?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,

got
you
on
nine
counts.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
stand
corrected.[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
stand
corrected.
