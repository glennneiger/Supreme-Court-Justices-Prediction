mr.
robert
allen
sedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
basic
parts
to
this
case.
one,
going
to
the
exercise
of
the
summary
contempt's
power,
the
other
going
to
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
cases
of
criminal
contempt.
with
respect
to
the
first
part,
the
petitioner
contends
that
this
court
should
hold
that
even
if
the
trial
judge
is
going
to
be
allowed
to
proceed
summarily,
there
is
a
minimal
entitlement
to
a
hearing,
notice
of
a
charge,
opportunity
to
respond
and
judgment.
secondly,
he
would
contend
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
trial
judge,
the
respondent
here
was
so
personally
embroiled
in
controversy
with
the
petitioner
that
he
could
not
impartially
sit
in
judgment
on
the
multiple
contempt
charges
that
he
leveled
against
him.
we
would
also
ask
this
court
to
consider,
the
issue
having
been
briefed
by
the
parties,
whether
the
summary
contempt
power
itself
is
unconstitutional.
if
the
court
is
going
to
hold
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
your
honor,
not
specifically.
the
--
nor
was
it
specifically
raised
as
such
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
it
seemed
to
me
that
as
we
were
developing
these
arguments
before
the
court,
it
was
impossible
to
separate
the
inherent
unfairness
in
the
exercise
of
the
summary
contempt
power,
from
question
such
as
the
right
to
a
hearing,
the
embroilment
of
a
particular
judge.
if
i
may
draw
an
analogy,
it
seems
that
long
ago,
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
summary
contempt
power
is
arbitrary
in
its
nature
and
is
subject
to
abuse
and
over
the
years
it’s
worked
out
various
refines.
for
example,
under
federal
rule
42
(a)
the
charges
must
be
specified.
it’s
developed
a
doctrine
of
embroilment
in
controversy
of
bias.
now,
we’re
asking
the
court
to
come
up
with
still
another
correction
on
the
doctrine
such
as
to
make
it
clear
that
there
is
the
right
to
a
hearing.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
in
so
doing
is
merely
treating
symptoms,
in
that
the
court
might
wish
to
consider
in
this
case
going
to
the
disease
itself.
and
the
disease,
we
feel
is
the
summary
contempt
power
which
combines
in
it
the
inherently
inconsistent
functions
of
prosecutor,
judge
and
jury
and
the
same
individual
who
is
necessarily
involved
in
the
events
leading
up
to
the
charge
and
this
is
why
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
by
citing
the
offending
lawyer
or
party
for
contempt.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
think,
your
honor,
that
that
should
be
a
sufficient
deterrent
in
all,
but
the
most
serious
cases
of
persistent
obstruction,
which
all
of
the
empirical
evidence
indicates
is
virtually
non
existent.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
this
is
true,
your
honor,
we
do
not
need
it
for
this
case,
but
i
honestly
feel
that
the
problem
will
remain.
the
problem
of
the
embroiled
judge.
the
problem
of
the
non-embroiled
judge,
who
may
try
as
best
he
or
she
can
impartially
to
sit
in
judgment,
but
still
cannot
separate
his
role
from
prosecuting
judge
and
trial
judge.
i
think
that
it
is
necessary
to
--
if
i
say
so,
in
order
to
ensure
proper
respect
for
the
administration
of
justice
in
this
country,
we
must
put
the
responsibility
where
it
lies
and
that
responsibility
is
on
the
court
itself.
the
summary
contempt
power
i
would
submit
produces
far
more
disrespect
for
the
administration
of
justice
than
any
act,
a
disruptive
client
or
a
lawyer
could
do
and
i
think
the
exercise
of
that
power
in
the
case
at
bar
shows
the
disrespect
that
can
result.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
would
take
the
position
of
going
back
one
step
before.
we
--
in
the
first
place
i
would
respectfully
dispute
that
there
was
any
improper
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
present
petitioner.
the
court
did
not
grant
certiorari
on
the
issues
of
whether
the
conduct
constituted
criminal
contempt.
but
i
would
submit
that
the
petitioner
here
did
nothing
more
than
vigorously
defend
to
the
best
of
his
ability
his
client
charged
with
a
capital
offense.
but
armed
with
the
summary
contempt
power,
the
respondent
in
this
case
could
proceed
as
an
activist
seeking
combat,
knowing
that
any
time
he
got
the
worst
of
the
exchange
he
could
always
invoke
the
summary
contempt
power.
i
think
that
comes
out
most
clearly
on
contempt
number
three
where
the
trial
judge
had
said
to
the
petitioner
and
counsel
for
the
other
defendant,
you
may
have
this
blackboard
in
the
courtroom
and
you
may
write
on
the
blackboard
the
inconsistent
statements
that
the
tape
of
the
key
prosecution
witness
showed
and
counsel
and
co-counsel
for
the
co-defendant
did
so.
at
the
end
of
this,
the
trial
judge
suddenly
says,
“mr.
sheriff,
remove
the
blackboard
from
the
room.”
petitioner
files
an
objection.
the
trial
judge
overrules
him
with
a
sarcastic
comment.
the
time
to
--
right
in
front
of
the
jury,
the
time
to
argue
your
case
is
at
the
close
of
the
evidence.
the
petitioner
responded
and
replied,
“i
certainly
keep
that
in
mind
your
honor.”
the
trial
judge
though
had
the
summary
contempt
power.
he
says
contempt
six
months
in
prison.
now
this
i
submit
is
just
fundamentally
unfair.
it’s
also
interesting
to
note
that
the
case
that
i
think
this
part
is
concerned
about
so
called
courtroom
disruption,
the
so
called
chicago
seven
case.
when
it
was
tried
before
a
judge
appointed
by
your
honor
who
was
not
certainly
and
personally
embroiled
in
controversy,
this
judge
found
that
every
act
of
the
lawyer
defendants
and
every
act
of
the
non-lawyer
defendants
accept
coming
into
court
with
judicial
robes
that
he
find
contemptuous
was
a
response
albeit
an
excessive
one
to
preemptory
action
on
behalf
of
the
judge.
i
think
the
danger
of
the
existence
of
the
summary
contempt
power
maybe
threefold,
yet
encourages
judges
to
act
arbitrarily
and
tyrannically
knowing
that
they
can
always
come
down
with
the
summary
contempt
power
on
a
lawyer.
secondly,
it
inhibits,
it
has
a
showing
effect
on
vigorous
and
effect
to
that
because
if
the
lawyer
was
found
by
the
trial
judge
to
have
overstepped
the
line,
the
trial
judge
doesn’t
have
to
warn
or
anything.
the
trial
judge
is
the
trial
judge
did
in
this
case
and
just
say
contempt.
this
causes
a
lawyer
to
pull
his
punches.
thirdly,
i
think
that
the
exercise
of
the
summary
contempt
power
causes
the
public
to
lose
confidence
in
the
administration
of
justice.
when
the
public
sees
a
judge
sitting
up
there
as
judge,
jury
and
prosecute
him
and
meeting
out
sentences
totaling
four
and
a
half
years,
this
i
do
think
brings
across
the
notion,
well,
what
kind
of
justice
is
there
if
a
judge
can
do
this
and
so
i
think
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
administration
of
justice
that
the
summary
contempt
power
with
its
inherent
unfairness
be
given
a
well
deserved
determent
by
this
court.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
i
think
that
the
--
as
the
study
of
this
order
in
the
court
in
the
case
the
judge
does
this
by
maintaining
control
over
the
proceedings
as
the
judge.
if
the
lawyer
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
by
ruling
on
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
then
the
judge
can
say
counsel,
i’ve
heard
enough
argument
on
this
point,
let
us
proceed.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
at
that
point,
the
judge
has
the
power
and
should
have
the
power,
we
don’t
dispute
that,
to
cite
the
counsel
for
contempt.
there
is
no
challenge
to
criminal
contempt.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
on
the
spot,
on
the
spot.
and
i
would
submit
that
just
as
any
other
social
--
antisocial
conduct
is
considered
deterred
by
the
possibility
of
punishment
at
a
later
date,
the
same
should
be
true
of
lawyer
misconduct.
in
other
words,
the
judge
will
have
cited
the
lawyer
for
contempt.
the
lawyer
knows
that
as
a
result
of
that
citation,
you
will
face
a
criminal
charge
of
contempt
with
possible
imprisonment
and
possible
bar
disciplinary
proceeding.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well
he
is
aware.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
he
doesn’t
have
much
choice.
i
mean
the
summary
contempt
power
exists.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
when
he
takes
his
oath
he
is
aware.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
and
punished
summarily.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
or
can
be
punished
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
think
that
that
would
be
enough.
what
frightens
me
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
i
think
the
problem
is
not
so
much
of
question
of
warning.
i
may
say
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
we're
focused
on
the
wrong
person.
we're
focused
on
the
lawyer.
i
would
respectfully
suggest
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well
there
is
an
adherent
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
think
that
that
the
problem
is
that
judges
can
act
arbitrarily
without
any
realistic
sanction
whatsoever
and
i
don’t
think
we
ought
to
allow
the
summary
contempt
power
which
simply
encourages
them
to
act
arbitrarily.
the
real
judges
that
will
do
so.
one
of
the
things
that
all
the
empirical
evidence
shows
is
that
the
summary
contempt
power
is
very
rarely
used
by
judges.
most
judges
can
maintain
order
and
decorum
in
the
courtroom
without
any
resort
to
the
summary
contempt
power
at
all.
but
the
legitimate
interest,
obviously
the
compelling
interest
if
you
will,
in
maintaining
courtroom
order
can
accurately
be
maintained
by
citing
the
lawyer
for
contempt.
now
in
the
extremely
rare
case
where
a
lawyer
is
engaged
on
a
course
of
persistent
disruption,
finding
him
guilty
of
contempt
isn’t
going
to
do
any
good
either.
by
that
time
the
trial
as
turned
into
the
shambles
and
the
court
should
declare
a
mistrial.
what’s
very
interesting
in
this
case
is
that
while
the
respondent
castigates
the
conduct
of
the
petitioner
and
says
in
his
brief
that
it
surely
must
have
prejudiced
his
client's
right
to
a
fair
trial,
the
respondent
not
only
did
not
declare
a
mistrial,
but
when
counsel
for
the
co-defendant
claimed
that
the
petitioner's
conduct
prejudiced
their
clients
right
to
a
fair
trial,
the
trial
judge
rejected
that
contention
and
of
course
that
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
he
moved
for
a
mistrial
on
numerous
grounds.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
no,
because
my
counsel
--
my
client,
i
would
submit
and
i
think
the
record
will
reveal,
was
trying
to
vigorously
defend
his
client
in
a
highly
emotionally
charged
situation.
he
was
coming
out
against
a
very
hostile
trial
judge
who
gave,
i
think
the
record
will
reveal,
the
prosecution
of
great
deal
of
leeway.
the
prosecution's
case
took
four
days.
when
the
case
for
the
both
defendants
came
up,
it
only
took
a
matter
of
three
days.
the
trial
judge
kept
saying
lets
move
it
on,
let’s
get
it
over.
you
can’t
call
this
witness,
he
has
nothing
to
add.
let’s
get
it
on.
let’s
move
it
over.
six
of
the
eight
contempts
occurred
during
the
defense
part
of
the
case.
this
is
the
time
of
the
case
where
the
attorney
is
most
vulnerable,
where
the
attorney
has
to
do
everything
that
he
can
to
protect
his
client,
to
present
his
case
to
the
jury,
all
the
while
battling
with
the
trial
judge
so
to
speak.
it’s
in
this
part
of
the
case
that
the
lawyer
is
most
apt
to
step
over
that
line,
the
line
where
permissible
advocacy
may
constitute
obstruction
of
justice.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
your
honor,
when
you
take
an
appeal,
you
run
into
the
problem
of
substantial
error.
the
dynamics
of
the
trial
show
that
what
may
seem
an
egregious
error
at
the
time
when
viewed
by
the
appellate
court
in
context
with
a
presumption
of
validity
of
a
conviction
will
frequently
be
found
to
be
harmless
error
and
the
dynamics
of
the
trial
require
that
the
lawyer
vigorously
defends
his
client
against
what
he
believes,
the
hostile
actions
of
the
trial
judge.
now
again,
we
are
not
saying
that
the
lawyer
cannot
be
punished
for
criminal
contempt.
when
the
lawyer's
conduct
is
contemptuous,
he
can
and
should
be
punished
for
criminal
contempt.
all
we
say
is
that
this
should
occur
in
accordance
with
the
time
tested
requirements
of
due
process
of
law.
that
the
trial
judge
should
not
be
able
to
proceed
summarily
that
no
matter
how
he
tries,
he
cannot
divorce
himself
from
the
fact
that
he
is
involved
in
the
events
leading
up
to
the
trial.
moreover,
in
a
criminal
proceeding
in
which
the
accused
faced
originally
four-and-a-half
years
imprisonment
and
now
it
was
cut
down
to
six
months
so
as
to
defeat
the
claim
of
the
jury
trial,
you
have
the
trial
judge
performing
the
necessarily
inconsistent
functions
of
prosecutor,
jury
and
judge.
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
crucial
things
that’s
wrong
with
the
criminal
contempt
power.
our
system
of
criminal
procedure
is
adversary
and
accusatory.
the
judge,
jury
and
prosecutor,
each
have
a
well
defined
role
to
play
in
the
process.
we
suddenly
for
this
shibboleth
of
preventing
disruption
combine
it
into
a
single
individual
who
is
necessarily
involved
in
the
events
leading
up
to
the
charge
and
i
think
no
matter
how
you
put
it,
it's
just
fundamentally
unfair
and
that
in
light
of
contemporary
standards
of
due
process
as
recognized
by
this
court,
the
summary
contempt
power
should
be
declared
invalid.
certainly
at
a
minimum
in
this
case,
the
court
should
hold
that
there
is
a
right
to
a
hearing,
and
by
a
hearing
i
mean
a
separation,
events
on
the
spot,
a
separation
of
the
contempt
proceedings
from
the
other
events
involved
in
the
trial.
the
lawyer
has
to
be
defending
the
interest
of
his
client.
he
can’t
put
his
own
interest
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
failed
to
see
your
honor
--
well,
let
me
--
let’s
assume
that
the
lawyer
filed
a
false
brief
or
pleading
or
something
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
assuming
in
kentucky,
we
have
a
procedure
by
which
when
all
of
the
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
are
disqualified
from
hearing
the
case
because
of
interest
or
involvement,
the
government
can
appoint
pro
tem
special
judges
to
hear
that
contempt.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
that
the
terms
of
protection
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
guess
that
the
best
answer
that
i
would
give
to
your
honor
is
that
the
exercise
of
the
summary
contempt
power
is
inconsistent
with
those
time
tested
principles
of
due
process
because
it
does
combine
the
inherently
inconsistent
functions
of
prosecutor,
jury
and
judge
in
the
same
instance
--
in
the
same
person
and
it
also
is
the
person
who
is
necessarily
involved
in
the
events.
and
the
other
answer
that
i
would
give
is
that
the
court
has
long
held
that
judicial
power
must
be
exercised
by
the
means
least
at
--
a
reason
of
--
by
least,
not
the
least
adequate
but
the
least
extreme
means
that
are
necessary
to
achieve
the
objective.
that
would
indicate
an
answer
to
your
honor's
question
that
maybe
there
would
be
no
choice,
but
that
the
supreme
court
or
an
appellate
court
would
have
to
exercise
the
summary
contempt
power,
but
that’s
not
where
the
problem
arises,
that’s
not
where
the
cases
come
up.
the
cases
come
up
from
trial
courts
and
so
i
would
say
that
the
means,
the
power
must
be
the
least
adequate
to
deal
with
the
problem
presented
then
this
would
justify
holding
that
the
summary
contempt
power
is
unconstitutional
when
exercised
by
the
trial
judge,
necessity
justifies
the
power,
if
at
all,
necessities
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
don’t
believe
that
the
underlying
statute
--
no,
we
are
not
challenging
criminal
contempt,
we
are
not
challenging
the
federal
or
state
statutes
that
provide
for
criminal
contempt.
all
we
are
saying
is
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
yes,
and
we
are
not
questioning
what
is
a
criminal
contempt.
all
we
are
saying
your
honor
is
that
criminal
contempt
should
not
be
punished
summarily.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
42
(a).
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
under
42
(b)
is
preferably
with
the
jury
and
this
i
think
moves
us
into
the
second
issue
in
this
case
and
here
again
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
oh
no!
mr.
taylor
has
long
been
a
member
of
the
kentucky
bar
and
defended
some
hundred
capital
cases,
extremely
well-known
to
the
trial
judge.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
he
certainly
will
be
subject
to
disciplinary
action
which
could
reach
out
disbarment
proportions.
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
which
shows
why
criminal
contempt
is
a
serious
offense
whenever
a
lawyer
is
involved
and
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
whether
the
conduct
constituted
criminal
contempt.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
he
would
cite,
he
would
cite
and
specify
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
oh!
it's
somewhat
analogous
to
a
grand
jury
indictment.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
depending
on
the
view
that
the
court
takes.
my
--
the
point
that
i
--
the
submission
that
i
would
make
is
that
--
is
that
contempt
of
court
as
defined
by
recent
decisions
of
this
court
such
as
the
little
case,
necessarily
constitutes
a
serious
offense
within
the
meaning
of
the
trial
by
jury
guarantee
because
it
is
the
kind
of
offense,
this
material,
intentional
obstruction
to
the
administration
of
justice
that
is
likely
to
be
regarded
as
contrary
to
the
ethics
of
the
community
and
secondly,
there
are
some
subsidiary
arguments.
many
of
the
criminal
contempt
cases
involved
lawyers.
lawyers
do
suffer
collateral
consequences
which
should
be
taken
into
account.
moreover,
the
court
itself
is
sitting
in
judgment
on
a
contempt
charge.
if
justice
must
serve
the
appearance
of
justice,
there
is
something
again
seriously
questionable
about
a
court
sitting
in
judgment
on
the
charge
of
contempt
of
court.
but
i
think
that
those
are
subsidiary
arguments.
i
think
the
major
argument
is
that
contempt
is
a
serious
offense
because
it
is
so
regarded
by
the
society
as
a
whole.
and
i
think
in
this
regard
it
is
because
criminal
contempt
has
been
defined
by
this
court
not
merely
to
include
so
called
disrespect
to
the
person
of
the
trial
judge,
but
as
requiring
an
actual
intentional
material
obstruction
to
the
administration
of
justice.
at
least
the
court
should
hold
that
where
there
is
the
possibility
of
substantial
imprisonment,
let’s
say
beyond
the
ten
days
approved
in
the
dyke
case,
that
contempt
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
i
would
argue
your
honor
in
light
of
argersinger
of
that
any
imprisonment
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
--
makes
the
charge
a
serious
one
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment’s
guarantee
of
right
to
trial
by
jury.
it
seems
to
me,
going
on
to
that
point,
that
the
sixth
amendment
speaks
in
clear
terms
of
all
criminal
prosecutions.
and
just
as
the
court
has
held
that
an
attorney,
i
am
sorry,
attorney
is
required
in
all
criminal
prosecutions
so
too
a
jury
trial
should
be
required.
the
only
difference
is
the
historical
genealogy
of
the
right
to
trial
by
jury.
but
when
the
court
has
been
dealing
with
the
seventh
amendment’s
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
civil
cases,
it’s
disregarded
historical
practice,
even
though
under
the
clean
up
doctrine
enacting
the
word
historically
equitable,
the
court
could
award
damages
without
a
jury,
this
court
has
held
that
every
time
there
is
a
claim
for
damages,
there
must
be
the
right
to
trial
by
jury.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
terms
of
the
sixth
amendment
are
just
as
clear
and
that
regardless
of
the
historical
practice,
the
clear
thrust
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
to
require
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
every
case
where
any
imprisonment
is
involved.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
yes,
your
honor
but
as
i
read
duncan,
it
holds
that
the
same
standards
apply
--
same
jury
standards
apply
to
the
state
courts.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
in
civil
actions,
no
your
honor.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
your
honor,
i
will
reserve
for
rebuttal
time.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
no.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
i
think
if
i
were
to
be
put,
i
was
answering
mr.
justice
rehnquist
question
in
regard
to
showing
effect
into
the
fact
that
the
lawyer
who
must
try
to
protect
the
rights
of
his
client
maybe
shielded
in
his
efforts
to
protest
trial
errors
at
the
time
that
they
occur.
and
my
point
was
that
merely
because
he
has
a
right
to
appeal
trial
errors,
it
doesn’t
mean
that
he
can
ignore
the
trial
errors
at
the
time
that
he
has
--
they
have
occurred.
his
duty
to
his
client
requires
him
to
try
to
correct
the
trial
error
before
the
judge
because
those
errors
cumulatively
could
have
an
impact
on
the
trial
even
though
taken
by
themselves,
they
might
not
constitute
substantial
and
reversible
error.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
think
that
the
line
is
drawn
where
the
trial
judge
says,
“counsel,
i’ve
heard
enough
argument
on
this
point,
proceed.”
so
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
appears
from
the
record
in
this
case,
your
honor
was
at
no
time
that
the
trial
judge
say
during
the
trial,
“mr.
taylor,
i
want
you
to
stop
this
behavior,
i
want
you
to
stop
this
line
of
argument.
you
are
heading
towards
the
line
where
advocacy
becomes
contempt.”
there
was
sort
as
if
the
judge
was
waiting
and
waiting
and
then
either
something
hit
him
personally
or
he
thought
the
line
was
crossed
and
he
pounced
on
contempt,
as
he
put
it
in
his
tirade
from
the
bench,
“i
have
you
nine
counts
of
contempt.”
and
i
think
that
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
yes,
there
comes
a
time
when
the
trial
judge
must
be
able
to
say
to
the
lawyer,
argument
is
stopped
on
this
point.
if
you
have
any
further
thing
you
want
to
say
to
the
appellate
court,
say
it
in
the
record.
but
i
want
to
leave
this
matter
and
get
on
to
something
else.
and
i
think
at
that
point,
if
the
lawyer
proceeds
he
could
be
cited
for
a
contempt
and
although
this
court
has
not
granted
certiorari
on
the
substantive
contempt
charges,
i
think
a
cursory
examination
of
the
charges
almost
on
their
face
will
reveal
that
they
do
not
constitute
criminal
contempt
under
the
standards
promulgated
by
the
court.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
have
a
comment
on
two
points.
mr.
triplett
says
that
the
petitioner
had
the
right
to
respond.
the
record
of
course
which
mr.
triplett
refers,
shows
that
this
simply
was
not
so,
but
more
importantly
what
we
are
in
agreement
on
is
that
there
was
no
hearing
insofar
as
the
petitioner
had
a
chance
to
respond
to
them
was
only
on
counts
two
and
three.
the
response
was
strictly
for
the
record
and
it
occurred
at
a
time
when
the
petitioner
was
required
to
argue
substantive
questions
to
protect
the
interests
of
his
client.
at
least
the
court
should
hold
that
due
process
requires
a
hearing
in
the
sentence
that
the
summary
contempt,
if
this
court
is
going
to
allow
it
to
go
on,
be
separated
from
the
other
events
in
the
case
that
the
trial
judge
specify
the
charge
which
never
occurred
here.
he
didn’t
specify
the
charge
until
three
months
later,
specify
the
charges,
listen
objectively
to
argument,
to
matters
in
defense
or
mitigation
and
then
make
a
ruling.
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
embroilment
what
the
respondent
says
as
well,
ignore
my
remarks
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
but
there
is
no
comment
about
everything
else
that
occurred
during
and
after
the
trial.
this
--
of
course,
it
is
a
burden
to
prove
embroilment.
here,
the
respondent
was
not
to
very
subtle.
he
says
to
the
petitioner
before
the
jury,
i
am
going
to
make
an
example
of
you.
i
am
going
to
do
something
the
bar
says
they
should
have
done
years
ago.
it’s
true
that
there
were
no
epithets
hurled
at
the
judge
by
the
petitioner,
but
it
was
just
a
reverse
when
the
judge
sent
--
when
the
petitioner
argued
i
may
have
four
or
five
months
of
my
life
tied
up
in
this
case.
the
judge
said
“acidly
before
it’s
over
you
might
have
a
lot
more
than
that,”
provoking
all
the
time,
“you’re
putting
on
the
show,
i
don’t
like
your
utters.”
then
he
said,
“you’ve
accused
me
of
rigging
the
jury,”
all
this
occurs
very
early
and
throughout
the
trial.
and
then
there
is
the
acts
of
the
judge
where
he
says
“you
can’t
practice
in
my
court
anymore.”
he
refused
to
hold
a
bail
hearing.
he
used
to
admit
the
petitioner
to
bail.
now
if
this
does
not
show
embroil
then
what
i
think
the
court
must
be
saying
is
that
there
is
no
such
concept
of
being
embroiled
in
controversy.
but
it
does
raise
the
question
of
the
--
what
i
call
the
inherent
unfairness
of
the
exercise
of
the
summary
contempt
power.
this
case
does
present
both
narrow
and
broad
issues.
the
petitioner
has
not
only
argued
his
own
case
and
has
not
limited
himself
to
the
narrow
issues
that
would
result
in
a
reversal
of
the
petitioner’s
conviction.
the
petitioner
believes
that
the
issues
presented
in
this
case
go
far
beyond
the
present
petitioner
and
the
present
respondent
and
have
deep
implications
for
the
administration
of
justice
itself.
petitioner
would
ask
this
court
to
reverse
his
conviction.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you
your
honors.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
basic
parts
to
this
case.
one,
going
to
the
exercise
of
the
summary
contempt's
power,
the
other
going
to
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
cases
of
criminal
contempt.
with
respect
to
the
first
part,
the
petitioner
contends
that
this
court
should
hold
that
even
if
the
trial
judge
is
going
to
be
allowed
to
proceed
summarily,
there
is
a
minimal
entitlement
to
a
hearing,
notice
of
a
charge,
opportunity
to
respond
and
judgment.
secondly,
he
would
contend
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
trial
judge,
the
respondent
here
was
so
personally
embroiled
in
controversy
with
the
petitioner
that
he
could
not
impartially
sit
in
judgment
on
the
multiple
contempt
charges
that
he
leveled
against
him.
we
would
also
ask
this
court
to
consider,
the
issue
having
been
briefed
by
the
parties,
whether
the
summary
contempt
power
itself
is
unconstitutional.
if
the
court
is
going
to
hold
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
your
honor,
not
specifically.
the
--
nor
was
it
specifically
raised
as
such
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
it
seemed
to
me
that
as
we
were
developing
these
arguments
before
the
court,
it
was
impossible
to
separate
the
inherent
unfairness
in
the
exercise
of
the
summary
contempt
power,
from
question
such
as
the
right
to
a
hearing,
the
embroilment
of
a
particular
judge.
if
i
may
draw
an
analogy,
it
seems
that
long
ago,
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
summary
contempt
power
is
arbitrary
in
its
nature
and
is
subject
to
abuse
and
over
the
years
it’s
worked
out
various
refines.
for
example,
under
federal
rule
42
(a)
the
charges
must
be
specified.
it’s
developed
a
doctrine
of
embroilment
in
controversy
of
bias.
now,
we’re
asking
the
court
to
come
up
with
still
another
correction
on
the
doctrine
such
as
to
make
it
clear
that
there
is
the
right
to
a
hearing.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
in
so
doing
is
merely
treating
symptoms,
in
that
the
court
might
wish
to
consider
in
this
case
going
to
the
disease
itself.
and
the
disease,
we
feel
is
the
summary
contempt
power
which
combines
in
it
the
inherently
inconsistent
functions
of
prosecutor,
judge
and
jury
and
the
same
individual
who
is
necessarily
involved
in
the
events
leading
up
to
the
charge
and
this
is
why
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
by
citing
the
offending
lawyer
or
party
for
contempt.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
think,
your
honor,
that
that
should
be
a
sufficient
deterrent
in
all,
but
the
most
serious
cases
of
persistent
obstruction,
which
all
of
the
empirical
evidence
indicates
is
virtually
non
existent.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
this
is
true,
your
honor,
we
do
not
need
it
for
this
case,
but
i
honestly
feel
that
the
problem
will
remain.
the
problem
of
the
embroiled
judge.
the
problem
of
the
non-embroiled
judge,
who
may
try
as
best
he
or
she
can
impartially
to
sit
in
judgment,
but
still
cannot
separate
his
role
from
prosecuting
judge
and
trial
judge.
i
think
that
it
is
necessary
to
--
if
i
say
so,
in
order
to
ensure
proper
respect
for
the
administration
of
justice
in
this
country,
we
must
put
the
responsibility
where
it
lies
and
that
responsibility
is
on
the
court
itself.
the
summary
contempt
power
i
would
submit
produces
far
more
disrespect
for
the
administration
of
justice
than
any
act,
a
disruptive
client
or
a
lawyer
could
do
and
i
think
the
exercise
of
that
power
in
the
case
at
bar
shows
the
disrespect
that
can
result.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
would
take
the
position
of
going
back
one
step
before.
we
--
in
the
first
place
i
would
respectfully
dispute
that
there
was
any
improper
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
present
petitioner.
the
court
did
not
grant
certiorari
on
the
issues
of
whether
the
conduct
constituted
criminal
contempt.
but
i
would
submit
that
the
petitioner
here
did
nothing
more
than
vigorously
defend
to
the
best
of
his
ability
his
client
charged
with
a
capital
offense.
but
armed
with
the
summary
contempt
power,
the
respondent
in
this
case
could
proceed
as
an
activist
seeking
combat,
knowing
that
any
time
he
got
the
worst
of
the
exchange
he
could
always
invoke
the
summary
contempt
power.
i
think
that
comes
out
most
clearly
on
contempt
number
three
where
the
trial
judge
had
said
to
the
petitioner
and
counsel
for
the
other
defendant,
you
may
have
this
blackboard
in
the
courtroom
and
you
may
write
on
the
blackboard
the
inconsistent
statements
that
the
tape
of
the
key
prosecution
witness
showed
and
counsel
and
co-counsel
for
the
co-defendant
did
so.
at
the
end
of
this,
the
trial
judge
suddenly
says,
“mr.
sheriff,
remove
the
blackboard
from
the
room.”
petitioner
files
an
objection.
the
trial
judge
overrules
him
with
a
sarcastic
comment.
the
time
to
--
right
in
front
of
the
jury,
the
time
to
argue
your
case
is
at
the
close
of
the
evidence.
the
petitioner
responded
and
replied,
“i
certainly
keep
that
in
mind
your
honor.”
the
trial
judge
though
had
the
summary
contempt
power.
he
says
contempt
six
months
in
prison.
now
this
i
submit
is
just
fundamentally
unfair.
it’s
also
interesting
to
note
that
the
case
that
i
think
this
part
is
concerned
about
so
called
courtroom
disruption,
the
so
called
chicago
seven
case.
when
it
was
tried
before
a
judge
appointed
by
your
honor
who
was
not
certainly
and
personally
embroiled
in
controversy,
this
judge
found
that
every
act
of
the
lawyer
defendants
and
every
act
of
the
non-lawyer
defendants
accept
coming
into
court
with
judicial
robes
that
he
find
contemptuous
was
a
response
albeit
an
excessive
one
to
preemptory
action
on
behalf
of
the
judge.
i
think
the
danger
of
the
existence
of
the
summary
contempt
power
maybe
threefold,
yet
encourages
judges
to
act
arbitrarily
and
tyrannically
knowing
that
they
can
always
come
down
with
the
summary
contempt
power
on
a
lawyer.
secondly,
it
inhibits,
it
has
a
showing
effect
on
vigorous
and
effect
to
that
because
if
the
lawyer
was
found
by
the
trial
judge
to
have
overstepped
the
line,
the
trial
judge
doesn’t
have
to
warn
or
anything.
the
trial
judge
is
the
trial
judge
did
in
this
case
and
just
say
contempt.
this
causes
a
lawyer
to
pull
his
punches.
thirdly,
i
think
that
the
exercise
of
the
summary
contempt
power
causes
the
public
to
lose
confidence
in
the
administration
of
justice.
when
the
public
sees
a
judge
sitting
up
there
as
judge,
jury
and
prosecute
him
and
meeting
out
sentences
totaling
four
and
a
half
years,
this
i
do
think
brings
across
the
notion,
well,
what
kind
of
justice
is
there
if
a
judge
can
do
this
and
so
i
think
it
is
in
the
interest
of
the
administration
of
justice
that
the
summary
contempt
power
with
its
inherent
unfairness
be
given
a
well
deserved
determent
by
this
court.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
i
think
that
the
--
as
the
study
of
this
order
in
the
court
in
the
case
the
judge
does
this
by
maintaining
control
over
the
proceedings
as
the
judge.
if
the
lawyer
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
by
ruling
on
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
then
the
judge
can
say
counsel,
i’ve
heard
enough
argument
on
this
point,
let
us
proceed.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
at
that
point,
the
judge
has
the
power
and
should
have
the
power,
we
don’t
dispute
that,
to
cite
the
counsel
for
contempt.
there
is
no
challenge
to
criminal
contempt.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
on
the
spot,
on
the
spot.
and
i
would
submit
that
just
as
any
other
social
--
antisocial
conduct
is
considered
deterred
by
the
possibility
of
punishment
at
a
later
date,
the
same
should
be
true
of
lawyer
misconduct.
in
other
words,
the
judge
will
have
cited
the
lawyer
for
contempt.
the
lawyer
knows
that
as
a
result
of
that
citation,
you
will
face
a
criminal
charge
of
contempt
with
possible
imprisonment
and
possible
bar
disciplinary
proceeding.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well
he
is
aware.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
he
doesn’t
have
much
choice.
i
mean
the
summary
contempt
power
exists.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
when
he
takes
his
oath
he
is
aware.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
and
punished
summarily.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
or
can
be
punished
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
think
that
that
would
be
enough.
what
frightens
me
your
honor
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
i
think
the
problem
is
not
so
much
of
question
of
warning.
i
may
say
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
we're
focused
on
the
wrong
person.
we're
focused
on
the
lawyer.
i
would
respectfully
suggest
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well
there
is
an
adherent
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
think
that
that
the
problem
is
that
judges
can
act
arbitrarily
without
any
realistic
sanction
whatsoever
and
i
don’t
think
we
ought
to
allow
the
summary
contempt
power
which
simply
encourages
them
to
act
arbitrarily.
the
real
judges
that
will
do
so.
one
of
the
things
that
all
the
empirical
evidence
shows
is
that
the
summary
contempt
power
is
very
rarely
used
by
judges.
most
judges
can
maintain
order
and
decorum
in
the
courtroom
without
any
resort
to
the
summary
contempt
power
at
all.
but
the
legitimate
interest,
obviously
the
compelling
interest
if
you
will,
in
maintaining
courtroom
order
can
accurately
be
maintained
by
citing
the
lawyer
for
contempt.
now
in
the
extremely
rare
case
where
a
lawyer
is
engaged
on
a
course
of
persistent
disruption,
finding
him
guilty
of
contempt
isn’t
going
to
do
any
good
either.
by
that
time
the
trial
as
turned
into
the
shambles
and
the
court
should
declare
a
mistrial.
what’s
very
interesting
in
this
case
is
that
while
the
respondent
castigates
the
conduct
of
the
petitioner
and
says
in
his
brief
that
it
surely
must
have
prejudiced
his
client's
right
to
a
fair
trial,
the
respondent
not
only
did
not
declare
a
mistrial,
but
when
counsel
for
the
co-defendant
claimed
that
the
petitioner's
conduct
prejudiced
their
clients
right
to
a
fair
trial,
the
trial
judge
rejected
that
contention
and
of
course
that
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
he
moved
for
a
mistrial
on
numerous
grounds.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
no,
because
my
counsel
--
my
client,
i
would
submit
and
i
think
the
record
will
reveal,
was
trying
to
vigorously
defend
his
client
in
a
highly
emotionally
charged
situation.
he
was
coming
out
against
a
very
hostile
trial
judge
who
gave,
i
think
the
record
will
reveal,
the
prosecution
of
great
deal
of
leeway.
the
prosecution's
case
took
four
days.
when
the
case
for
the
both
defendants
came
up,
it
only
took
a
matter
of
three
days.
the
trial
judge
kept
saying
lets
move
it
on,
let’s
get
it
over.
you
can’t
call
this
witness,
he
has
nothing
to
add.
let’s
get
it
on.
let’s
move
it
over.
six
of
the
eight
contempts
occurred
during
the
defense
part
of
the
case.
this
is
the
time
of
the
case
where
the
attorney
is
most
vulnerable,
where
the
attorney
has
to
do
everything
that
he
can
to
protect
his
client,
to
present
his
case
to
the
jury,
all
the
while
battling
with
the
trial
judge
so
to
speak.
it’s
in
this
part
of
the
case
that
the
lawyer
is
most
apt
to
step
over
that
line,
the
line
where
permissible
advocacy
may
constitute
obstruction
of
justice.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
your
honor,
when
you
take
an
appeal,
you
run
into
the
problem
of
substantial
error.
the
dynamics
of
the
trial
show
that
what
may
seem
an
egregious
error
at
the
time
when
viewed
by
the
appellate
court
in
context
with
a
presumption
of
validity
of
a
conviction
will
frequently
be
found
to
be
harmless
error
and
the
dynamics
of
the
trial
require
that
the
lawyer
vigorously
defends
his
client
against
what
he
believes,
the
hostile
actions
of
the
trial
judge.
now
again,
we
are
not
saying
that
the
lawyer
cannot
be
punished
for
criminal
contempt.
when
the
lawyer's
conduct
is
contemptuous,
he
can
and
should
be
punished
for
criminal
contempt.
all
we
say
is
that
this
should
occur
in
accordance
with
the
time
tested
requirements
of
due
process
of
law.
that
the
trial
judge
should
not
be
able
to
proceed
summarily
that
no
matter
how
he
tries,
he
cannot
divorce
himself
from
the
fact
that
he
is
involved
in
the
events
leading
up
to
the
trial.
moreover,
in
a
criminal
proceeding
in
which
the
accused
faced
originally
four-and-a-half
years
imprisonment
and
now
it
was
cut
down
to
six
months
so
as
to
defeat
the
claim
of
the
jury
trial,
you
have
the
trial
judge
performing
the
necessarily
inconsistent
functions
of
prosecutor,
jury
and
judge.
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
crucial
things
that’s
wrong
with
the
criminal
contempt
power.
our
system
of
criminal
procedure
is
adversary
and
accusatory.
the
judge,
jury
and
prosecutor,
each
have
a
well
defined
role
to
play
in
the
process.
we
suddenly
for
this
shibboleth
of
preventing
disruption
combine
it
into
a
single
individual
who
is
necessarily
involved
in
the
events
leading
up
to
the
charge
and
i
think
no
matter
how
you
put
it,
it's
just
fundamentally
unfair
and
that
in
light
of
contemporary
standards
of
due
process
as
recognized
by
this
court,
the
summary
contempt
power
should
be
declared
invalid.
certainly
at
a
minimum
in
this
case,
the
court
should
hold
that
there
is
a
right
to
a
hearing,
and
by
a
hearing
i
mean
a
separation,
events
on
the
spot,
a
separation
of
the
contempt
proceedings
from
the
other
events
involved
in
the
trial.
the
lawyer
has
to
be
defending
the
interest
of
his
client.
he
can’t
put
his
own
interest
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
failed
to
see
your
honor
--
well,
let
me
--
let’s
assume
that
the
lawyer
filed
a
false
brief
or
pleading
or
something
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
assuming
in
kentucky,
we
have
a
procedure
by
which
when
all
of
the
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
are
disqualified
from
hearing
the
case
because
of
interest
or
involvement,
the
government
can
appoint
pro
tem
special
judges
to
hear
that
contempt.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
that
the
terms
of
protection
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
guess
that
the
best
answer
that
i
would
give
to
your
honor
is
that
the
exercise
of
the
summary
contempt
power
is
inconsistent
with
those
time
tested
principles
of
due
process
because
it
does
combine
the
inherently
inconsistent
functions
of
prosecutor,
jury
and
judge
in
the
same
instance
--
in
the
same
person
and
it
also
is
the
person
who
is
necessarily
involved
in
the
events.
and
the
other
answer
that
i
would
give
is
that
the
court
has
long
held
that
judicial
power
must
be
exercised
by
the
means
least
at
--
a
reason
of
--
by
least,
not
the
least
adequate
but
the
least
extreme
means
that
are
necessary
to
achieve
the
objective.
that
would
indicate
an
answer
to
your
honor's
question
that
maybe
there
would
be
no
choice,
but
that
the
supreme
court
or
an
appellate
court
would
have
to
exercise
the
summary
contempt
power,
but
that’s
not
where
the
problem
arises,
that’s
not
where
the
cases
come
up.
the
cases
come
up
from
trial
courts
and
so
i
would
say
that
the
means,
the
power
must
be
the
least
adequate
to
deal
with
the
problem
presented
then
this
would
justify
holding
that
the
summary
contempt
power
is
unconstitutional
when
exercised
by
the
trial
judge,
necessity
justifies
the
power,
if
at
all,
necessities
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
don’t
believe
that
the
underlying
statute
--
no,
we
are
not
challenging
criminal
contempt,
we
are
not
challenging
the
federal
or
state
statutes
that
provide
for
criminal
contempt.
all
we
are
saying
is
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
yes,
and
we
are
not
questioning
what
is
a
criminal
contempt.
all
we
are
saying
your
honor
is
that
criminal
contempt
should
not
be
punished
summarily.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
42
(a).
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
under
42
(b)
is
preferably
with
the
jury
and
this
i
think
moves
us
into
the
second
issue
in
this
case
and
here
again
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
oh
no!
mr.
taylor
has
long
been
a
member
of
the
kentucky
bar
and
defended
some
hundred
capital
cases,
extremely
well-known
to
the
trial
judge.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
he
certainly
will
be
subject
to
disciplinary
action
which
could
reach
out
disbarment
proportions.
i
think
that
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
which
shows
why
criminal
contempt
is
a
serious
offense
whenever
a
lawyer
is
involved
and
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
whether
the
conduct
constituted
criminal
contempt.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
he
would
cite,
he
would
cite
and
specify
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
oh!
it's
somewhat
analogous
to
a
grand
jury
indictment.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
depending
on
the
view
that
the
court
takes.
my
--
the
point
that
i
--
the
submission
that
i
would
make
is
that
--
is
that
contempt
of
court
as
defined
by
recent
decisions
of
this
court
such
as
the
little
case,
necessarily
constitutes
a
serious
offense
within
the
meaning
of
the
trial
by
jury
guarantee
because
it
is
the
kind
of
offense,
this
material,
intentional
obstruction
to
the
administration
of
justice
that
is
likely
to
be
regarded
as
contrary
to
the
ethics
of
the
community
and
secondly,
there
are
some
subsidiary
arguments.
many
of
the
criminal
contempt
cases
involved
lawyers.
lawyers
do
suffer
collateral
consequences
which
should
be
taken
into
account.
moreover,
the
court
itself
is
sitting
in
judgment
on
a
contempt
charge.
if
justice
must
serve
the
appearance
of
justice,
there
is
something
again
seriously
questionable
about
a
court
sitting
in
judgment
on
the
charge
of
contempt
of
court.
but
i
think
that
those
are
subsidiary
arguments.
i
think
the
major
argument
is
that
contempt
is
a
serious
offense
because
it
is
so
regarded
by
the
society
as
a
whole.
and
i
think
in
this
regard
it
is
because
criminal
contempt
has
been
defined
by
this
court
not
merely
to
include
so
called
disrespect
to
the
person
of
the
trial
judge,
but
as
requiring
an
actual
intentional
material
obstruction
to
the
administration
of
justice.
at
least
the
court
should
hold
that
where
there
is
the
possibility
of
substantial
imprisonment,
let’s
say
beyond
the
ten
days
approved
in
the
dyke
case,
that
contempt
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
i
would
argue
your
honor
in
light
of
argersinger
of
that
any
imprisonment
--
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
--
makes
the
charge
a
serious
one
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment’s
guarantee
of
right
to
trial
by
jury.
it
seems
to
me,
going
on
to
that
point,
that
the
sixth
amendment
speaks
in
clear
terms
of
all
criminal
prosecutions.
and
just
as
the
court
has
held
that
an
attorney,
i
am
sorry,
attorney
is
required
in
all
criminal
prosecutions
so
too
a
jury
trial
should
be
required.
the
only
difference
is
the
historical
genealogy
of
the
right
to
trial
by
jury.
but
when
the
court
has
been
dealing
with
the
seventh
amendment’s
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
civil
cases,
it’s
disregarded
historical
practice,
even
though
under
the
clean
up
doctrine
enacting
the
word
historically
equitable,
the
court
could
award
damages
without
a
jury,
this
court
has
held
that
every
time
there
is
a
claim
for
damages,
there
must
be
the
right
to
trial
by
jury.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
terms
of
the
sixth
amendment
are
just
as
clear
and
that
regardless
of
the
historical
practice,
the
clear
thrust
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
to
require
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
in
every
case
where
any
imprisonment
is
involved.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
yes,
your
honor
but
as
i
read
duncan,
it
holds
that
the
same
standards
apply
--
same
jury
standards
apply
to
the
state
courts.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
in
civil
actions,
no
your
honor.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
your
honor,
i
will
reserve
for
rebuttal
time.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
no.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
well,
i
think
if
i
were
to
be
put,
i
was
answering
mr.
justice
rehnquist
question
in
regard
to
showing
effect
into
the
fact
that
the
lawyer
who
must
try
to
protect
the
rights
of
his
client
maybe
shielded
in
his
efforts
to
protest
trial
errors
at
the
time
that
they
occur.
and
my
point
was
that
merely
because
he
has
a
right
to
appeal
trial
errors,
it
doesn’t
mean
that
he
can
ignore
the
trial
errors
at
the
time
that
he
has
--
they
have
occurred.
his
duty
to
his
client
requires
him
to
try
to
correct
the
trial
error
before
the
judge
because
those
errors
cumulatively
could
have
an
impact
on
the
trial
even
though
taken
by
themselves,
they
might
not
constitute
substantial
and
reversible
error.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
i
think
that
the
line
is
drawn
where
the
trial
judge
says,
“counsel,
i’ve
heard
enough
argument
on
this
point,
proceed.”
so
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
appears
from
the
record
in
this
case,
your
honor
was
at
no
time
that
the
trial
judge
say
during
the
trial,
“mr.
taylor,
i
want
you
to
stop
this
behavior,
i
want
you
to
stop
this
line
of
argument.
you
are
heading
towards
the
line
where
advocacy
becomes
contempt.”
there
was
sort
as
if
the
judge
was
waiting
and
waiting
and
then
either
something
hit
him
personally
or
he
thought
the
line
was
crossed
and
he
pounced
on
contempt,
as
he
put
it
in
his
tirade
from
the
bench,
“i
have
you
nine
counts
of
contempt.”
and
i
think
that
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
yes,
there
comes
a
time
when
the
trial
judge
must
be
able
to
say
to
the
lawyer,
argument
is
stopped
on
this
point.
if
you
have
any
further
thing
you
want
to
say
to
the
appellate
court,
say
it
in
the
record.
but
i
want
to
leave
this
matter
and
get
on
to
something
else.
and
i
think
at
that
point,
if
the
lawyer
proceeds
he
could
be
cited
for
a
contempt
and
although
this
court
has
not
granted
certiorari
on
the
substantive
contempt
charges,
i
think
a
cursory
examination
of
the
charges
almost
on
their
face
will
reveal
that
they
do
not
constitute
criminal
contempt
under
the
standards
promulgated
by
the
court.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
allen
sedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
have
a
comment
on
two
points.
mr.
triplett
says
that
the
petitioner
had
the
right
to
respond.
the
record
of
course
which
mr.
triplett
refers,
shows
that
this
simply
was
not
so,
but
more
importantly
what
we
are
in
agreement
on
is
that
there
was
no
hearing
insofar
as
the
petitioner
had
a
chance
to
respond
to
them
was
only
on
counts
two
and
three.
the
response
was
strictly
for
the
record
and
it
occurred
at
a
time
when
the
petitioner
was
required
to
argue
substantive
questions
to
protect
the
interests
of
his
client.
at
least
the
court
should
hold
that
due
process
requires
a
hearing
in
the
sentence
that
the
summary
contempt,
if
this
court
is
going
to
allow
it
to
go
on,
be
separated
from
the
other
events
in
the
case
that
the
trial
judge
specify
the
charge
which
never
occurred
here.
he
didn’t
specify
the
charge
until
three
months
later,
specify
the
charges,
listen
objectively
to
argument,
to
matters
in
defense
or
mitigation
and
then
make
a
ruling.
with
respect
to
the
matter
of
embroilment
what
the
respondent
says
as
well,
ignore
my
remarks
at
the
time
of
sentencing,
but
there
is
no
comment
about
everything
else
that
occurred
during
and
after
the
trial.
this
--
of
course,
it
is
a
burden
to
prove
embroilment.
here,
the
respondent
was
not
to
very
subtle.
he
says
to
the
petitioner
before
the
jury,
i
am
going
to
make
an
example
of
you.
i
am
going
to
do
something
the
bar
says
they
should
have
done
years
ago.
it’s
true
that
there
were
no
epithets
hurled
at
the
judge
by
the
petitioner,
but
it
was
just
a
reverse
when
the
judge
sent
--
when
the
petitioner
argued
i
may
have
four
or
five
months
of
my
life
tied
up
in
this
case.
the
judge
said
“acidly
before
it’s
over
you
might
have
a
lot
more
than
that,”
provoking
all
the
time,
“you’re
putting
on
the
show,
i
don’t
like
your
utters.”
then
he
said,
“you’ve
accused
me
of
rigging
the
jury,”
all
this
occurs
very
early
and
throughout
the
trial.
and
then
there
is
the
acts
of
the
judge
where
he
says
“you
can’t
practice
in
my
court
anymore.”
he
refused
to
hold
a
bail
hearing.
he
used
to
admit
the
petitioner
to
bail.
now
if
this
does
not
show
embroil
then
what
i
think
the
court
must
be
saying
is
that
there
is
no
such
concept
of
being
embroiled
in
controversy.
but
it
does
raise
the
question
of
the
--
what
i
call
the
inherent
unfairness
of
the
exercise
of
the
summary
contempt
power.
this
case
does
present
both
narrow
and
broad
issues.
the
petitioner
has
not
only
argued
his
own
case
and
has
not
limited
himself
to
the
narrow
issues
that
would
result
in
a
reversal
of
the
petitioner’s
conviction.
the
petitioner
believes
that
the
issues
presented
in
this
case
go
far
beyond
the
present
petitioner
and
the
present
respondent
and
have
deep
implications
for
the
administration
of
justice
itself.
petitioner
would
ask
this
court
to
reverse
his
conviction.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
thank
you
your
honors.
