mr.
henry
a.
triplett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court’s
permission,
i
will
deal
first
with
the
question
raised
in
this
petition
as
to
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
taylor
was
given
a
right
to
be
heard
during
a
proceeding
that
resulted
in
his
conviction
for
criminal
contempt.
it
is
our
position
and
we
think
the
record
completely
sustains
it
that
all
during
the
trial
and
in
each
time
the
petitioner
were
cited
for
a
contempt
by
judge
hayes
that
he
was
indeed
given
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
in
most
instances
he
took
it.
so
it
is
our
position
here
that
this
is
really
not
a
question
of
law,
but
a
question
of
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
this
15-volume
transcript
sustains
a
position
that
taylor
was
indeed
given
a
chance
to
be
heard
on
the
contempts
and
whether
or
not
he
was
given
the
right
to
state
the
mitigating
factors
which
if
no
allocution
does
exist
in
a
summary
contempt
proceeding
he
would
be
entitled
to
give.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
record
does
indeed
show
that
each
instance
that
he
gave
the
mitigating
circumstances
of
which
he
was
aware,
these
included
a
marriage,
a
funeral,
working
without
pay,
long
hours
of
being
tired.
so
first
it
is
our
position
that
the
record
sustained
a
hearing.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
a
marriage
and
a
funeral,
and
that
sort
of
thing
--
things
that
caused
him
to
be
tired
and
things
that
--
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
mr.
taylor.
and
keep
in
mind,
mr.
taylor
was
there,
there
were
two
or
three
other
lawyers
representing
the
co-defendant
in
the
trial
and
of
course
the
court
would
be
the
principles
involved
in
this
case.
so
we
say
the
record
is
replete
with
that.
second
we
say,
that
not
only
do
we
say
that
the
record
does
sustain
that
he
was
heard
as
we
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court
starting
with
terry
and
all
the
discussion
that
has
occurred
since
terry
about
the
validity
of
terry,
it
nevertheless
remains
that
in
terry,
this
was
a
case
where
david
terry
knocked
the
marshal
down
after
the
marshal
started
to
eject
his
wife
from
the
courtroom.
and
in
affirming
or
rather
refusing
to
grant
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
this
court
said
that
there
was
a
right
of
instant
apprehension
and
imprisonment
with
no
allocution.
coming
forward
to
the
case
involving
judge
medina,
the
sacher
case
although
this
court
took
that
case
solely
on
the
question
of
the
bias
of
judge
medina
and
his
qualification
to
hear
the
contempt
involving
the
attorney
sacher.
the
premise
of
the
case
was
that
there
was
no
allocution
as
it
is
explicitly
stated
in
the
federal
rules
that
is
the
right
of
--
to
speak
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing.
however,
in
sacher
the
same
kind
of
allocution
occurred
as
occurred
here.
throughout
the
nine-month
trial
there
was
continuous
dialogue
between
judge
medina
and
the
lawyers
involved
and
there
couldn’t
be
of
much
doubt
that
everybody
was
pretty
aware
of
what
was
transpiring
and
that
this
court
did
not
set
aside
that
conviction
because
of
a
right
--
because
of
no
hearing.
and
this
is
--
it
seems
to
be
the
hearing,
the
procedure
all
through
in
the
sarafite
case,
the
ungar-sarafite
case.
again,
there
was
a
lot
of
dialogue
in
the
trial
between
judge
sarafite
and
unger
who
was
on
the
witness
stand
during
the
trial
of
hulan
jack
and
i
think
the
hearing
took
two
days
--
placed
two
days
after
the
trial,
ungar
appeared
with
a
lawyer.
the
lawyer
moved
for
continuance
and
judge
would
give
him
a
continuance,
he
withdrew
from
the
case
and
then
ungar,
all
he
said
was
“i
am
not
feeling
well
and
i’d
like
a
continuance,”
and
that
was
the
allocution
in
that
case
and
this
court
held
that
conviction
sufficient.
now,
next
i
would
like
to
turn
very
quickly
to
the
right
of
a
trial
by
jury
in
this
case.
the
petitioner
stands
convicted
of
criminal
contempt.
the
highest
court
in
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
has
said
that
his
ultimate
sentence
to
be
served
is
six
months.
we
say,
taking
the
literal
language
in
the
bloom
against
illinois
case
where
the
petitioner
got
24
months
for
offering
a
will
alleged
to
be
forged
and
which
was
reversed
by
this
case
and
keeping
in
mind
that
the
bloom
against
illinois
case,
the
opinion
was
released
on
may
28,
1968,
the
same
day
as
duncan
against
louisiana.
it
is
said
under
the
rule
in
cheff,
when
the
legislature
has
not
expressed
a
judgment
as
to
the
seriousness
of
an
offense
fixing
a
maximum
penalty
which
may
be
imposed,
we
are
to
look
to
the
penalty
actually
imposed
as
to
the
best
evidence
of
the
seriousness
of
the
offense.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
as
they
were
initially
opposed
by
judge
hayes,
they
were
consecutive.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
after
they
were
imposed,
judge
hayes
corrected
his
judgment
with
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky’s
permission
and
eliminated
the
requirement
of
consecutiveness
and
it
was
the
ultimate
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
meant
six
months.
although
we
bring
the
question
of
the
right
of
the
trial
court
and
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
permit
this
correction
and
of
judge
hayes
to
do
it,
this
point
is
conceded
by
petitioner
on
page
21
of
his
brief
when
he
says
in
addition,
the
respondent
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
an
appellate
court
has
the
power
to
modify
sentences,
this
petitioner
does
not
dispute.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
yes,
sir.
the
right
to
modify
and
eliminate
and
reduce
contempt
sentences
in
my
mind
is
really
not
open
to
seriousness
of
--
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
one
six
months,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
on
eight
counts.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
yes,
sir.
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
has
affirmed
it
and
this
court
has
refused
to
grant
cert
on
that
question.
and
if
the
bar
association
does
that,
they
haven’t
yet,
i
don’t
know
that
they
will,
they
would
have
the
right
to
do
it,
but
if
they
do,
do
it,
you
are
exactly
correct
that
they
would
consider
the
eight
findings
of
contempt
as
burden
only
of
any
disciplinary
action
that
might
ultimately
be
taken.
i
think
i
would
have
to
state
that
to
you
affirmatively.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
that’s
correct
sir.
that’s
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
now
--
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
no,
mr.
justice
stewart
there
was
none.
this
was
some
what
up
in
the
air
of
although
the
ten
was
--
the
trend
was
away
from
it,
but
the
court
of
appeals
case
of
taylor
against
hayes
declared
the
limiting
statute
unconstitutional
as
being
abridgment
on
the
court’s
power
to
function.
so
that
this
point
in
time
mr.
justice,
there
is
no
limitation.
we
used
to
have
the
30-hour
rule,
30-hour
or
$30.00
rule
that
began
to
be
eroded
some
years
back
and
they
cleared
it
up
completely
in
this
case.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
theoretically,
that
was
true
as
it
was
true
in
bloom
against
illinois,
yes
sir.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
i
was
drawing
a
series
of
things,
isolated
portions
of
it.
it
was
all
wrapped
up
in
his
final
argument
to
the
jury
when
he
said
this
--
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
on
page
119
of
the
transcript
mr.
chief
justice,
where
petitioner
says
this.
“i
want
to
try
to
pose,
i
want
to
apologize
to
the
court
if
i
had
been
in
temper
and
state
to
the
court
that
would
only
been
because
of
the
desire
to
see
justice
done
in
the
clearer
conviction
of
believe
that
my
client
is
innocent.
i
want
to
tell
you
that
life
has
moved
on
since
this
case
began.
there
has
been
a
wedding
in
my
family,
a
funeral
of
a
dear
friend
of
mine”
and
those
things
are
interspersed
of
throughout
of
the
trial
mr.
chief
justice.
and
we
say
that
all
of
this
were
example
of
petitioner
at
one
point
during
the
trial
as
to
be
excused
on
a
saturday
afternoon
and
the
transcript
will
support
this,
so
he
could
go
to
this
wedding
of
a
relative
who
was
flying
in,
and
we
also
contend
that
those
transcripts
show
a
great
deal
of
consideration
toward
petitioner’s
problems
by
the
trial
court.
wrapping
up
this
jury
in
a
matter
very
quickly.
in
frank
versus
united
states
in
1969,
the
--
this
court
affirmed
the
judgment
where
mr.
frank
got
a
three-year
suspended
sentence
for
a
stock
fraud
case.
in
the
cheff
and
schnackenberg
case
in
1966,
this
was
where,
mr.
cheff
violated
the
cease
and
desist
order
and
three
judges
of
the
seventh
circuit
tried
him
and
gave
him
six
months.
this
court
held
it
was
a
petty
offense.
so
we
think
that
what
happened
here
has
well
within
the
decisions
of
this
court.
now,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
what
i
consider
the
third
phase
of
this
case
as
i
understand
the
questions
upon
which
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
that
relates
to
the
alleged
or
biased
hostility
of
judge
hayes
as
to
render
him
unqualified
to
pass
judgment
on
these
contempts.
we
start
with
mayberry.
nothing
similar
to
mayberry
occurred
here.
there
was
no
vilification
by
taylor
or
judge
hayes.
there
were
no
epithets
hurled
at
judge
hayes.
second,
we
come
to
offutt.
there
is
nothing
similar
to
what
occurred
in
offutt
here.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
justice
i
didn’t
hear
you.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
we
say
that
that
occurred
after
the
judgment
of
contempt
had
been
--
wait
a
minute
sir,
i
don’t
recall
anything
in
this
trial
or
this
transcript
that
said
--
where
judge
hayes
said,
“taylor,
now
i
got
you.”
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
i
dispute
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
dispute
that
judge
hayes
said
that.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
alright
sir.
now,
let
me
be
very
clear
and
honest.
at
the
time
he
imposed
the
sentence,
there
was
language
in
there,
he
said
i
have
got
you
on
nine
contempts.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
but
i
read
that
in
a
different
context
mr.
justice
marshall
as
saying,
“now
i’ve
got
you.”
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
i
don’t
mean
to
be
argumentative
on
--
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
that
is
correct
sir,
that’s
exactly
what
he
said.
now,
it
is
our
position
mr.
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court
that
at
the
time
of
sentence,
the
trial
that
occurred
on
the
matter
of
contempt
and
at
some
point
in
imposing
the
punishment,
a
judge
must
have
the
last
say
and
the
last
word.
the
right
to
be
heard,
we
say
had
occurred.
the
reasons
for
mitigation
and
defense
had
occurred.
it
is
not
uncommon
for
judges
at
the
end
of
a
trial
and
i
am
not
speaking
only
of
lawyers
at
this
point,
i
am
speaking
of
a
defendant.
suppose
a
judge
hears
a
particularly
aggravated
case
that
just
shocks
of
conscience
of
any
human
being,
it
is
not
uncommon
for
state
and
federal
judges
and
i
have
heard
them
both
do
it,
to
just
absolutely
take
the
punishment
apart
or
defendant
apart
when
he
imposes
sentence.
otherwise,
there
wouldn't
be
much
reason
for
the
disparity
in
some
of
the
sentences
that
are
imposed.
with
the
sentencing
power
in
the
federal
court,
certainly
the
aggravating
circumstances
of
a
particular
crime
or
a
set
of
circumstances
will
cause
a
federal
district
judge
to
impose
a
larger
sentence
than
a
lesser
sentence
or
even
to
probate.
and
we
say
that
just
because
a
judge
comes
down
hard
on
the
defendant
at
the
time
he
imposes
a
sentence
is
not
a
predisposition
of
hostility,
particularly
when
we
claim
that
the
bias
or
a
plain
bias
throughout
this
15-volume
record
is
just
absolutely
not
present.
and
that’s
absolutely
what
we
feel
about
it.
let
me
address
myself,
if
i
may
just
for
a
moment,
excuse
me
sir,
[attempt
to
laughter]
if
i
may
to
this
proposition
that
whenever
a
summary
of
contempt
occurs
that
the
trial
judge
must
recuse
himself
and
allow
it
to
be
heard
by
another
judge.
let’s
take
a
very
practical
question
and
mr.
justice
marshall
alluded
to
it
in
a
question
to
mr.
sedler,
when
he
asked
which
court
would
hear
this.
let’s
take
father
groppi’s
case
in
michigan,
where
the
people
were
led
through
the
legislature.
and
let’s
assume
that
the
michigan
general
assembly
was
in
joint
session,
the
senate
and
the
house.
they
cite
father
groppi
for
contempt.
now
the
fact
that
they
saw
this,
they
heard
this,
which
legislative
body
is
going
to
try
that
contempt.
let’s
assume
that
if
a
trial
judge
is
going
to
have
to
recuse
himself
in
other
cases,
let’s
see
now
whose
going
to
do
that.
is
it
going
to
be
his
brother
trial
judge
in
the
same
district
or
the
same
circuit
or
in
the
same
state?
must
it
go
outside
the
state?
is
it
going
to
occur
as
it
occurred
in
the
codispoti
case
which
i
understand
is
going
to
be
heard
here
next
week.
codispoti
got
his
second
judge
and
what
he
said
to
the
second
judge
was
about
as
bad
as
what
was
that.[voice
overlap]
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
yes
sir,
excuse
me,
i’m
sorry
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
he
was
in
jail
for
disorderly
conduct
and
two
days
later
without
the
present
hearing,
notice
of
papers
they
imposed
a
punishment,
that
is
exactly
right
mr.
chief
justice.
but
would
the
bias
or
the
disqualification
be
any
less
because
father
groppi
led
the
group
pass
the
wisconsin
legislature
you
say,
then
the
contempt
occurring
before
a
trial
judge.
we
think
not
and
we
think
that
this
displays
some
fallacy
in
the
proposition
that
they
must
be
heard
by
another
judge
or
by
some
other
forum
and
perhaps
that
can
be
dealt
with
in
this
case.
we
think
that
the
most
important
factor
and
the
most
important
protection
of
a
judge
and
of
a
lawyer
involved
in
the
criminal
contempt
case
is
that
it
appears
on
the
transcript.
there
is
a
record
that
an
appellate
court
can
do.
and
this
is
somewhat
followed
by
a
--
stated
by
the
weisberg
case
out
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
when
these
things
appear
on
the
record,
this
prevent
a
judge
without
any
court
reporter,
without
any
witnesses
must
do
it
in
public,
prevents
any
abuse
in
that
respect.
bringing
my
argument
to
an
end
here,
we
think
that
for
two-week
period
and
including
the
ultimate
part
here,
judge
hayes
did
a
pretty
good
job
in
this
trial
if
he’d
imposed
a
punishment
on
taylor
at
the
time
the
contempt
is
heard
--
were
heard,
he
could
claim
a
psychological
disadvantage
to
hurt
his
client.
if
he
didn’t
cite
him
for
contempt
and
did
nothing
then
they
would
be
a
claim
that
he
discreetly
searched
the
record
after
all
this
occurred.
what
he
did
was
at
that
the
time
they
occurred
was
to
cite
him,
permit
him
to
be
heard
in
practically
all
instances
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
he
imposed
the
punishments
that
he
thought
proper
and
then
he
corrected
them
as
the
petitioner
has
conceded,
he
had
a
right
to
do.
we
think
that
it
is
highly
necessary
for
the
integrity
of
the
judiciary
which
protects
the
freedom
of
us
all,
that
this
judgment
be
affirmed.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
with
the
court’s
permission,
i
will
deal
first
with
the
question
raised
in
this
petition
as
to
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
taylor
was
given
a
right
to
be
heard
during
a
proceeding
that
resulted
in
his
conviction
for
criminal
contempt.
it
is
our
position
and
we
think
the
record
completely
sustains
it
that
all
during
the
trial
and
in
each
time
the
petitioner
were
cited
for
a
contempt
by
judge
hayes
that
he
was
indeed
given
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
be
heard
and
in
most
instances
he
took
it.
so
it
is
our
position
here
that
this
is
really
not
a
question
of
law,
but
a
question
of
fact
as
to
whether
or
not
this
15-volume
transcript
sustains
a
position
that
taylor
was
indeed
given
a
chance
to
be
heard
on
the
contempts
and
whether
or
not
he
was
given
the
right
to
state
the
mitigating
factors
which
if
no
allocution
does
exist
in
a
summary
contempt
proceeding
he
would
be
entitled
to
give.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
record
does
indeed
show
that
each
instance
that
he
gave
the
mitigating
circumstances
of
which
he
was
aware,
these
included
a
marriage,
a
funeral,
working
without
pay,
long
hours
of
being
tired.
so
first
it
is
our
position
that
the
record
sustained
a
hearing.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
a
marriage
and
a
funeral,
and
that
sort
of
thing
--
things
that
caused
him
to
be
tired
and
things
that
--
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
mr.
taylor.
and
keep
in
mind,
mr.
taylor
was
there,
there
were
two
or
three
other
lawyers
representing
the
co-defendant
in
the
trial
and
of
course
the
court
would
be
the
principles
involved
in
this
case.
so
we
say
the
record
is
replete
with
that.
second
we
say,
that
not
only
do
we
say
that
the
record
does
sustain
that
he
was
heard
as
we
understand
the
decisions
of
this
court
starting
with
terry
and
all
the
discussion
that
has
occurred
since
terry
about
the
validity
of
terry,
it
nevertheless
remains
that
in
terry,
this
was
a
case
where
david
terry
knocked
the
marshal
down
after
the
marshal
started
to
eject
his
wife
from
the
courtroom.
and
in
affirming
or
rather
refusing
to
grant
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
this
court
said
that
there
was
a
right
of
instant
apprehension
and
imprisonment
with
no
allocution.
coming
forward
to
the
case
involving
judge
medina,
the
sacher
case
although
this
court
took
that
case
solely
on
the
question
of
the
bias
of
judge
medina
and
his
qualification
to
hear
the
contempt
involving
the
attorney
sacher.
the
premise
of
the
case
was
that
there
was
no
allocution
as
it
is
explicitly
stated
in
the
federal
rules
that
is
the
right
of
--
to
speak
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing.
however,
in
sacher
the
same
kind
of
allocution
occurred
as
occurred
here.
throughout
the
nine-month
trial
there
was
continuous
dialogue
between
judge
medina
and
the
lawyers
involved
and
there
couldn’t
be
of
much
doubt
that
everybody
was
pretty
aware
of
what
was
transpiring
and
that
this
court
did
not
set
aside
that
conviction
because
of
a
right
--
because
of
no
hearing.
and
this
is
--
it
seems
to
be
the
hearing,
the
procedure
all
through
in
the
sarafite
case,
the
ungar-sarafite
case.
again,
there
was
a
lot
of
dialogue
in
the
trial
between
judge
sarafite
and
unger
who
was
on
the
witness
stand
during
the
trial
of
hulan
jack
and
i
think
the
hearing
took
two
days
--
placed
two
days
after
the
trial,
ungar
appeared
with
a
lawyer.
the
lawyer
moved
for
continuance
and
judge
would
give
him
a
continuance,
he
withdrew
from
the
case
and
then
ungar,
all
he
said
was
“i
am
not
feeling
well
and
i’d
like
a
continuance,”
and
that
was
the
allocution
in
that
case
and
this
court
held
that
conviction
sufficient.
now,
next
i
would
like
to
turn
very
quickly
to
the
right
of
a
trial
by
jury
in
this
case.
the
petitioner
stands
convicted
of
criminal
contempt.
the
highest
court
in
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
has
said
that
his
ultimate
sentence
to
be
served
is
six
months.
we
say,
taking
the
literal
language
in
the
bloom
against
illinois
case
where
the
petitioner
got
24
months
for
offering
a
will
alleged
to
be
forged
and
which
was
reversed
by
this
case
and
keeping
in
mind
that
the
bloom
against
illinois
case,
the
opinion
was
released
on
may
28,
1968,
the
same
day
as
duncan
against
louisiana.
it
is
said
under
the
rule
in
cheff,
when
the
legislature
has
not
expressed
a
judgment
as
to
the
seriousness
of
an
offense
fixing
a
maximum
penalty
which
may
be
imposed,
we
are
to
look
to
the
penalty
actually
imposed
as
to
the
best
evidence
of
the
seriousness
of
the
offense.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
as
they
were
initially
opposed
by
judge
hayes,
they
were
consecutive.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
after
they
were
imposed,
judge
hayes
corrected
his
judgment
with
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky’s
permission
and
eliminated
the
requirement
of
consecutiveness
and
it
was
the
ultimate
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
this
meant
six
months.
although
we
bring
the
question
of
the
right
of
the
trial
court
and
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
permit
this
correction
and
of
judge
hayes
to
do
it,
this
point
is
conceded
by
petitioner
on
page
21
of
his
brief
when
he
says
in
addition,
the
respondent
makes
much
of
the
fact
that
an
appellate
court
has
the
power
to
modify
sentences,
this
petitioner
does
not
dispute.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
yes,
sir.
the
right
to
modify
and
eliminate
and
reduce
contempt
sentences
in
my
mind
is
really
not
open
to
seriousness
of
--
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
one
six
months,
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
on
eight
counts.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
yes,
sir.
the
court
of
appeals
of
kentucky
has
affirmed
it
and
this
court
has
refused
to
grant
cert
on
that
question.
and
if
the
bar
association
does
that,
they
haven’t
yet,
i
don’t
know
that
they
will,
they
would
have
the
right
to
do
it,
but
if
they
do,
do
it,
you
are
exactly
correct
that
they
would
consider
the
eight
findings
of
contempt
as
burden
only
of
any
disciplinary
action
that
might
ultimately
be
taken.
i
think
i
would
have
to
state
that
to
you
affirmatively.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
that’s
correct
sir.
that’s
correct
mr.
chief
justice.
now
--
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
no,
mr.
justice
stewart
there
was
none.
this
was
some
what
up
in
the
air
of
although
the
ten
was
--
the
trend
was
away
from
it,
but
the
court
of
appeals
case
of
taylor
against
hayes
declared
the
limiting
statute
unconstitutional
as
being
abridgment
on
the
court’s
power
to
function.
so
that
this
point
in
time
mr.
justice,
there
is
no
limitation.
we
used
to
have
the
30-hour
rule,
30-hour
or
$30.00
rule
that
began
to
be
eroded
some
years
back
and
they
cleared
it
up
completely
in
this
case.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
theoretically,
that
was
true
as
it
was
true
in
bloom
against
illinois,
yes
sir.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
i
was
drawing
a
series
of
things,
isolated
portions
of
it.
it
was
all
wrapped
up
in
his
final
argument
to
the
jury
when
he
said
this
--
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
on
page
119
of
the
transcript
mr.
chief
justice,
where
petitioner
says
this.
“i
want
to
try
to
pose,
i
want
to
apologize
to
the
court
if
i
had
been
in
temper
and
state
to
the
court
that
would
only
been
because
of
the
desire
to
see
justice
done
in
the
clearer
conviction
of
believe
that
my
client
is
innocent.
i
want
to
tell
you
that
life
has
moved
on
since
this
case
began.
there
has
been
a
wedding
in
my
family,
a
funeral
of
a
dear
friend
of
mine”
and
those
things
are
interspersed
of
throughout
of
the
trial
mr.
chief
justice.
and
we
say
that
all
of
this
were
example
of
petitioner
at
one
point
during
the
trial
as
to
be
excused
on
a
saturday
afternoon
and
the
transcript
will
support
this,
so
he
could
go
to
this
wedding
of
a
relative
who
was
flying
in,
and
we
also
contend
that
those
transcripts
show
a
great
deal
of
consideration
toward
petitioner’s
problems
by
the
trial
court.
wrapping
up
this
jury
in
a
matter
very
quickly.
in
frank
versus
united
states
in
1969,
the
--
this
court
affirmed
the
judgment
where
mr.
frank
got
a
three-year
suspended
sentence
for
a
stock
fraud
case.
in
the
cheff
and
schnackenberg
case
in
1966,
this
was
where,
mr.
cheff
violated
the
cease
and
desist
order
and
three
judges
of
the
seventh
circuit
tried
him
and
gave
him
six
months.
this
court
held
it
was
a
petty
offense.
so
we
think
that
what
happened
here
has
well
within
the
decisions
of
this
court.
now,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
what
i
consider
the
third
phase
of
this
case
as
i
understand
the
questions
upon
which
this
court
granted
certiorari
and
that
relates
to
the
alleged
or
biased
hostility
of
judge
hayes
as
to
render
him
unqualified
to
pass
judgment
on
these
contempts.
we
start
with
mayberry.
nothing
similar
to
mayberry
occurred
here.
there
was
no
vilification
by
taylor
or
judge
hayes.
there
were
no
epithets
hurled
at
judge
hayes.
second,
we
come
to
offutt.
there
is
nothing
similar
to
what
occurred
in
offutt
here.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
i
beg
your
pardon
mr.
justice
i
didn’t
hear
you.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
we
say
that
that
occurred
after
the
judgment
of
contempt
had
been
--
wait
a
minute
sir,
i
don’t
recall
anything
in
this
trial
or
this
transcript
that
said
--
where
judge
hayes
said,
“taylor,
now
i
got
you.”
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
i
dispute
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
i
dispute
that
judge
hayes
said
that.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
alright
sir.
now,
let
me
be
very
clear
and
honest.
at
the
time
he
imposed
the
sentence,
there
was
language
in
there,
he
said
i
have
got
you
on
nine
contempts.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
but
i
read
that
in
a
different
context
mr.
justice
marshall
as
saying,
“now
i’ve
got
you.”
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
that’s
correct
sir.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
i
don’t
mean
to
be
argumentative
on
--
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
that
is
correct
sir,
that’s
exactly
what
he
said.
now,
it
is
our
position
mr.
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court
that
at
the
time
of
sentence,
the
trial
that
occurred
on
the
matter
of
contempt
and
at
some
point
in
imposing
the
punishment,
a
judge
must
have
the
last
say
and
the
last
word.
the
right
to
be
heard,
we
say
had
occurred.
the
reasons
for
mitigation
and
defense
had
occurred.
it
is
not
uncommon
for
judges
at
the
end
of
a
trial
and
i
am
not
speaking
only
of
lawyers
at
this
point,
i
am
speaking
of
a
defendant.
suppose
a
judge
hears
a
particularly
aggravated
case
that
just
shocks
of
conscience
of
any
human
being,
it
is
not
uncommon
for
state
and
federal
judges
and
i
have
heard
them
both
do
it,
to
just
absolutely
take
the
punishment
apart
or
defendant
apart
when
he
imposes
sentence.
otherwise,
there
wouldn't
be
much
reason
for
the
disparity
in
some
of
the
sentences
that
are
imposed.
with
the
sentencing
power
in
the
federal
court,
certainly
the
aggravating
circumstances
of
a
particular
crime
or
a
set
of
circumstances
will
cause
a
federal
district
judge
to
impose
a
larger
sentence
than
a
lesser
sentence
or
even
to
probate.
and
we
say
that
just
because
a
judge
comes
down
hard
on
the
defendant
at
the
time
he
imposes
a
sentence
is
not
a
predisposition
of
hostility,
particularly
when
we
claim
that
the
bias
or
a
plain
bias
throughout
this
15-volume
record
is
just
absolutely
not
present.
and
that’s
absolutely
what
we
feel
about
it.
let
me
address
myself,
if
i
may
just
for
a
moment,
excuse
me
sir,
[attempt
to
laughter]
if
i
may
to
this
proposition
that
whenever
a
summary
of
contempt
occurs
that
the
trial
judge
must
recuse
himself
and
allow
it
to
be
heard
by
another
judge.
let’s
take
a
very
practical
question
and
mr.
justice
marshall
alluded
to
it
in
a
question
to
mr.
sedler,
when
he
asked
which
court
would
hear
this.
let’s
take
father
groppi’s
case
in
michigan,
where
the
people
were
led
through
the
legislature.
and
let’s
assume
that
the
michigan
general
assembly
was
in
joint
session,
the
senate
and
the
house.
they
cite
father
groppi
for
contempt.
now
the
fact
that
they
saw
this,
they
heard
this,
which
legislative
body
is
going
to
try
that
contempt.
let’s
assume
that
if
a
trial
judge
is
going
to
have
to
recuse
himself
in
other
cases,
let’s
see
now
whose
going
to
do
that.
is
it
going
to
be
his
brother
trial
judge
in
the
same
district
or
the
same
circuit
or
in
the
same
state?
must
it
go
outside
the
state?
is
it
going
to
occur
as
it
occurred
in
the
codispoti
case
which
i
understand
is
going
to
be
heard
here
next
week.
codispoti
got
his
second
judge
and
what
he
said
to
the
second
judge
was
about
as
bad
as
what
was
that.[voice
overlap]
excuse
me
sir?
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
yes
sir,
excuse
me,
i’m
sorry
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
henry
a.
triplett
he
was
in
jail
for
disorderly
conduct
and
two
days
later
without
the
present
hearing,
notice
of
papers
they
imposed
a
punishment,
that
is
exactly
right
mr.
chief
justice.
but
would
the
bias
or
the
disqualification
be
any
less
because
father
groppi
led
the
group
pass
the
wisconsin
legislature
you
say,
then
the
contempt
occurring
before
a
trial
judge.
we
think
not
and
we
think
that
this
displays
some
fallacy
in
the
proposition
that
they
must
be
heard
by
another
judge
or
by
some
other
forum
and
perhaps
that
can
be
dealt
with
in
this
case.
we
think
that
the
most
important
factor
and
the
most
important
protection
of
a
judge
and
of
a
lawyer
involved
in
the
criminal
contempt
case
is
that
it
appears
on
the
transcript.
there
is
a
record
that
an
appellate
court
can
do.
and
this
is
somewhat
followed
by
a
--
stated
by
the
weisberg
case
out
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
when
these
things
appear
on
the
record,
this
prevent
a
judge
without
any
court
reporter,
without
any
witnesses
must
do
it
in
public,
prevents
any
abuse
in
that
respect.
bringing
my
argument
to
an
end
here,
we
think
that
for
two-week
period
and
including
the
ultimate
part
here,
judge
hayes
did
a
pretty
good
job
in
this
trial
if
he’d
imposed
a
punishment
on
taylor
at
the
time
the
contempt
is
heard
--
were
heard,
he
could
claim
a
psychological
disadvantage
to
hurt
his
client.
if
he
didn’t
cite
him
for
contempt
and
did
nothing
then
they
would
be
a
claim
that
he
discreetly
searched
the
record
after
all
this
occurred.
what
he
did
was
at
that
the
time
they
occurred
was
to
cite
him,
permit
him
to
be
heard
in
practically
all
instances
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
he
imposed
the
punishments
that
he
thought
proper
and
then
he
corrected
them
as
the
petitioner
has
conceded,
he
had
a
right
to
do.
we
think
that
it
is
highly
necessary
for
the
integrity
of
the
judiciary
which
protects
the
freedom
of
us
all,
that
this
judgment
be
affirmed.
