mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
may
it
please
the
court?
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
yes,
sir.
i
represent
new
york
state
which
is
amicus
in
this
case.
now,
this
certiorari
rises
here
from
the
dismissal
of
their
complaint.
now,
their
complaint
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
contained
11
separate
grounds
and
they
are
grouped
into
four
basic
groups.
the
first
was
lack
of
original
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
the
second
was,
the
controversy
was
in
fact
against
the
state
of
new
york
and
united
states
and
not
against
these
defendants.
thirdly,
that
there
was
an
identical
claim
pending
against
united
states
before
the
indian
land
commission.
and
lastly,
about
the
complaint
fail
--
an
amended
complaint
fail
to
state
a
course
of
action.
if
i
believe
not
only
before
your
honors
is
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
but
all
of
those
because
this
was
what
the
motion
originally
was
made
for
and
this
was
the
motion
that
was
granted.
now,
to
succeed
here
therefore
it
is
my
contention
that
they
must
establish
one,
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
two,
the
right
to
sue
the
defendants
who
are
holding
the
lands
in
this
case
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
in
the
state
of
new
york
or
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
governmental
capacity.
three,
their
right
to
maintain
this
action
despite
the
fact
that
as
the
court
belong
noted
that
there
was
pending
before
the
indian
lands
commission
have
claimed
for
damages
which
would
include
these
damages
unless
they
brought
back
complaints
basic
course
of
action.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
the
court
of
appeals’
main
--
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
the
court
of
appeals,
they
will
mainly
without
the
court
noted
the
other
action
pending
in
its
opinion
and
but
basically
before
they
can
be
in
the
federal
court,
they
must
have
a
good
complaint.
if
the
complaint
fails
its
jurisdiction
of
it
and
--
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
no.
basically,
this
was
the
--
the
court
went
on
jurisdiction.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
now,
it’s
our
contention
here
first
that
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
is
--
they
contend
that
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
is
inapplicable
to
the
28
u.s.c.
1362.
despite
the
fact
that
it’s
always
been
held
to
be
applicable
to
1331
(a).
both
of
these
are
jurisdictional
sections
and
provide
that
the
course
in
action
must
arise
under
the
constitution
laws
and
treaties
of
the
united
states.
the
same
language
was
used
in
both
and
there
was
no
change
of
this
in
the
language.
the
difference
within
one
was
that
at
the
claim
must
exceed
10,000
and
the
other
that
the
claim
must
be
brought
by
an
indian.
now,
these
statutes
are
in
pari
materia,
the
same
language
was
used.
the
court
--
when
congress
uses
the
same
language
and
that
language
has
been
always
interpreted
to
include
the
best,
the
complaint
rule,
then
it
is
certainly
was
meant
to
include
it
in
this
case
too.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
red
light
went
on
yesterday,
we
were
talking
about
section
1331
(a)
and
1362
being
in
pari
materia
and
i
maintain
that
if
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
was
applicable
to
1331
(a)
it
must
also
be
applicable
to
1362.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
senate
report
and
i
got
a
quote
here
from
it,
that
was
made
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
these
bills
and
the
house
report
contains
similar
language
says,
“the
purpose
of
the
bill
as
amended
is
to
permit
indian
tribes
to
bring
civil
actions
arising
under
the
constitution
treaties
and
laws
of
the
united
states
without
regard
to
the
$10,000.00
limitation
and
accordingly
amends
chapter
85
title
28
united
states
code
by
adding
new
section.”
now,
the
same
reports
and
i
got
it
as
an
appendix
to
my
brief
states
that
the
reason
this
was
necessary
or
came
about
was
a
federal
case
yoda(ph)
against
asian
born(ph)
339
f2
360.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
there
was
federal
question
but
because
the
jurisdictional
amount
wasn’t
met,
the
claim
was
dismissed
and
it
was
because
of
the
yoda
case
that
they
felt
it
was
necessary
to
amend
the
law
by
giving
the
indians
the
right
to
sue
where
the
amount
was
less
than
$10,000.00,
since
most
of
the
indian
claims
being
individual
was
less
than
$10,000.00
and
they
could
not
group
them
or
take
them
to
get
jurisdiction.
now
yesterday,
your
honors
went
into
the
question
of
whether
the
plaintiffs
have
a
right
to
sue
in
new
york
state.
it
is
our
contention
that
plaintiffs
do
have
a
right
to
sue
in
new
york
state
that
is
if
they
have
standing.
we
do
not
concede
that
they
have
a
case
in
this.
now,
plaintiffs
say
that
they
do
not
have
this
right.
we
maintain
that
new
york
states
indian
law
sections
5
and
11
(a)
given
that
right
to
sue
a
new
york
state.
now
--
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
yes.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
alright
now,
on
that
question
i
think
i
call
your
attention
to
the
seneca
versus
christy
case
in
1891.
in
seneca
versus
christy,
the
seneca
nation
sued.
they
have
been
given
special
permission
by
a
new
york
state
statute
to
sue.
now,
new
york
state
upheld
their
right
to
sue
but
decided
against
them.
it's
decided
against
them
first
on
a
question
of
the
indian
nonintercourse
act.
it
stated
that
the
original
act
passed
in
1790
contained
a
statement
any
state
where
they
have
the
right
of
preemption
to
such
answer
or
not
was
banned.
the
1790
--
they
went
in
under
1800
something
statute.
ours
is
the
1793
statute
but
both
had
this
portion
deleted
and
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
at
that
time
held
that
the
deletion
of
these
words
indicated,
that
the
congress
intended
that
the
preemption
state
should
not
be
barred
from
having
deals
with
the
indians,
and
this
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
christy
case
shows
new
york
followed
over
a
hundred
years.
now,
the
second
reason
why
the
indians
would
deny
relief
in
new
york
was
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
act
which
they
sued
under
said
they
could
sue
to
the
same
extent
as
other
persons
and
statute
of
limitations
is
about
for
anybody
who
brings
his
action
too
late
and
they
had.
now,
there
is
similar
wedding
in
new
york
state
indian
law
section
5.
now,
seneca
was
appealed
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
and
the
united
states
supreme
court
held
that
it
was
decided
on
two
issues.
one
of
them
the
federal
question,
the
first
question
which
i
discussed
and
the
second
limitation
which
was
a
state
question
and
it
said,
since
it
could
be
maintained
under
a
state
question,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
be
vacated
and
so,
in
the
seneca
case
i
say
this
court
has
already
ruled
that
when
new
york
state
grants
the
right
to
sue,
there
is
the
right
to
sue.
now,
indian
law
section
5
was
first
enacted
in
1902
that
was
right
after
the
seneca
case,
1892
rather.
in
1902,
the
new
york
state
land
commission
acting
through
the
attorney
general
issued
an
opinion
stating
that
“the
law
gives
the
indians
the
right
to
ejectment
in
courts
of
record
to
the
same
extent
as
other
citizens.”
here
the
action
is
basically
an
ejectment
action,
in
an
ejectment
action
the
right
is
based
on
the
right
to
possession
of
property.
here
there
right
to
damages
would
only
be
because
they
were
being
denied
possession.
in
other
words,
they
must
have
had
a
right
to
possession.
now,
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
proponents
give
excerpts
from
a
affidavit
by
donald
segun(ph),
an
assistant
attorney
general,
and
in
that
case
he
took
the
position
at
that
time
that
there
was
no
capacity
to
sue
in
new
york's
state.
however,
that
was
our
position
only
in
the
court
of
claims
that
position
we
changed
and
because
we
found
we
were
wrong,
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
it
says
as
follows,
and
that’s
saint
bridget’s(ph)
versus
state
of
new
york,
5
new
york
second
24,
and
that’s
on
page
35.
on
this
appeal,
the
state
concedes
that
the
claimants
have
capacity
to
sue.
they
do
not
argue
if
there
is
a
defect
in
indispensable
parties.
so,--
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
saint
bridget’s
is
cited
in
my
brief
here.
now,
if
they
sue
under
new
york
state
law,
there
is
a
possibility
of
the
defense
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
standing
to
sue
does
not
mean
that
they
are
going
to
win.
if
they
sue
us
in
the
state
of
new
york,
we
are
going
to
fight
like
to
dues
to
keep
them
from
winning
and
i
think
we
have
grounds,
the
merits
of
this
but
we
would
not
raise
if
they
brought
an
action
against
the
state
in
the
court
of
claims,
we
would
not
raise
the
questions
of
standing.
i
have
been
authorized
to
say
this
by
the
solicitor
general
of
the
state
of
new
york.
now
in
the
brief,
plaintiffs
contend
further
that
the
new
york
state,
that
the
right
to
sue
was
brought
about
because
of
25
u.s.c.
233.
now,
25
u.s.c.
233
they
say
and
it
does
contain
a
limitation
that
the
right
to
sue
is
for
actions
and
events
transpiring,
if
the
september
13,
1952.
well,
let’s
say
assuming
their
right,
what
are
they
suing
for
here?
rent?
damages
in
the
form
of
rent
that
occurred
after
january
1,
1968.
the
course
of
action
accrues
after
the
deadline
date
of
1952.
so
even
on
the
rent
own
interpretation
of
a
statute,
they
have
no
right
to
be
here
and
we
also
maintain
that
25
u.s.c.
made
it
mandatory
for
new
york
state
to
permit
indians
to
sue
in
their
state
for
events
that
occurred
after
september
13,
1952.
but
it
did
not
prevent
us
from
giving
him
the
right
to
sue
for
events
that
occurred
prior
to
this.
this
we
say
we
could
do
and
that
we
did
do
it
and
this
we
say,
your
court
has
held
we
could
do
in
the
case
of
seneca
versus
christy.
now,
plaintiffs
here
state
that
indian
law
section
11
(a)
and
that’s
the
law
that
says,
not
only
do
indians
have
the
right
to
sue
but
indian
tribes
and
indian
bands
have
the
right
to
sue
in
new
york
was
passed
as
a
result
of
25
u.s.c.
233.
in
this
they
are
wrong.
this
is
not
the
section
that
was
passed.
the
section
was
passed
at
the
time
of
233
was
the
amendment
to
indian
law
section
5,
and
we
have
a
letter
that
we
cite
the
contents
of
it
in
our
own
brief,
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
the
government
at
the
time
that
was
been
enacted
and
it
says,
“the
bill
will
not
take
away
jurisdiction
from
the
peacemakers
court
but
we
will
give
the
state
court’s
concurrent
jurisdiction.
this
step
is
authorized
by
congress,
if
such
authority
was
needed
we
question
the
need
even
then
that
of
the
authority
too
and
we
maintain
that
we
could
grant
the
authority.”
and
they
referred
to
the
act
of
september
13,
1952,
25
u.s.c.
233.
thus,
it
was
the
amendment
to
section
5.
now
section
11
(a)
was
passed
in
1958.
this
removes
any
doubt
on
their
right
to
sue,
in
it,
it
has
granted
the
right
to
not
only
to
individual
indians
but
indian
tribes
and
indian
bands.
in
other
words,
whatever
the
status
of
an
indian
tribe
is
whether
corporate
or
not
corporate
or
whatever
it
is,
new
york
state
by
section
of
11
(a)
recognizes
there
right
to
sue.
we
also
say
the
action
must
be
dismissed
because
there
is
another
action
pending
at
this
time
and
the
other
action
pending
is
the
claim
by
the
indians
before
the
indian
commissioners
and
it
was
cited
in
the
court
below.
now,
your
honors
were
questioning
my
opponent
here
on
whether,
why
that
was
not
a
duplication
of
damages?
i
do
not
see
why
it
isn’t.
he
makes
some
sort
of
distinction
he
says
that
before
the
indian
court
of
claims,
all
they
could
get
is
the
damages
they
suffered
at
the
time
that
the
transaction
was
made.
actually,
if
they
have,
united
states
has
giving
them
the
right
to
sue
for
what
they
were
damaged
and
if
they
have
a
right
to
sue
for
the
damages,
it
would
be
total
damages
including
increase
of
interest
are
damages
and
if
they
suffer
them.
now,
in
seneca
versus
united
states
173
court
of
claims
912
and
then
several
other
cases,
the
united
states
court
of
claims
held
that
there
is
a
claim
in
favor
of
indians
for
--
under
circumstances
where
the
indian
tribe
sold
land
without
being
represented.
it
however,
did
not
reach
the
question
of
whether
new
york
state
was
bound
by
the
nonintercourse
act
or
not.
it
cited
a
number
of
authorities
in
the
opinion
which
held
otherwise
but
didn’t
reach
a
conclusion.
now,
we
also
maintain
here
that
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
defense.
the
defendants
here
are
the
counties
of
oneida
and
madison.
in
the
complaint,
it
is
alleged
that
the
lands
were
used
for
the
building
of
roads
and
other
public
improvements.
the
use
of
the
property
by
a
county
in
a
governmental
capacity
is
protected
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
when
a
county
does
so,
it
is
acting
for
the
state
and
as
such
it
enjoys
the
state’s
immunity.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
i
am
not
sure
your
honor
on
that.
and
certainly,
if
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
defense
here,
then
the
indians
who
would
come
in
under
the
theory
of
either
as
suing
the
state
would
be
either
a
citizen
of
this
state
or
a
citizen
of
wisconsin
in
either
case
under
the
parton(ph)
case
they
could
not
sue.
now,
we
also
maintain
here
and
this
probably
would
only
go
in
the
event,
your
honors,
would
decide
that
they
have
a
original
jurisdiction
on
the
question
of
1362
and
might
be
referred
back
to
the
circuit
court,
that
a
complaint
does
not
state
the
course
of
action.
and
one
other
things
i
want
to
call
to
your
honors’
attention
is
that
there
was
a
substantial
difference
as
it
was
cited
in
seneca
v.
christy
case
between
the
law
of
1790
and
the
law
of
1793.
the
law
of
1790
was
specifically
forbad
states
having
the
right
of
preemption
to
enter
to
an
agreement.
the
law
of
1793
which
was
a
law
in
effect
at
the
time
this
transaction
was
made
had
that
portion
deleted.
it
did
not
contain
this
ban.
now,
new
york
state
as
was
shown
in
christy
made
39
treaties
during
that
period
of
time
after
the
law
of
1793
went
into
effect
and
only
five
of
them
did
not
have
a
federal
commission
of
(inaudible).
now,
the
united
states
recognized
this,
the
united
states
in
many
cases
granted
substitute
lands
to
the
indians
who
have
sold
to
the
united
states,
they
passively
approved
this.
the
indians
made
no
complaint,
we
have
almost
200
years
that
have
gone
by
and
a
practical
construction
such
as
we
had
here
which
the
parties
have
undertaken
for
such
a
long
period
of
time
should
not
be
change
even
if
there
is
and
equally
tenable
interpretation
the
other
way.
in
the
instant
case,
i
say
this
is
very
necessary
because
if
we
follow
through
the
fruits
of
a
decision
against
us,
we
would
really
have
an
economic
upheaval
in
all
of
the
preemption
states
where
deals
were
made
for
the
purchase
of
land
probably
about
200
years
ago,
and
it
would
be
upsetting
titles
all
over
the
eastern
part
of
the
country.
thank
you.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
red
light
went
on
yesterday,
we
were
talking
about
sections
31
(a),
1331
(a)
and
1362
being
empower
material.
i
maintained
that
if
the
well
preeded
complaint
rule
is
applicable
to
1331(a),
it
must
also
be
applicable
to
1362.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
senate
report
and
i
have
got
a
quote
here
from
it
that
was
made
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
these
bills
and
house
report
constrains
similar
language
says,
the
purpose
of
the
bill
as
a
mandate
is
to
permit
indian
tribes
to
bring
civil
actions
arising
onto
the
constitution,
treaties
and
laws
of
the
united
states
without
regard
to
the
$10,000
limitation
and
accordingly
amended
chapter
85
title
28,
united
states
code
by
adding
a
new
section.
now,
the
same
report
and
i
have
got
it
in
as
an
appendix
to
my
brief,
states
that
the
reason
this
was
necessary
or
came
about
was
a
federal
case
yoder
against
assiniboine.
339
f2
360.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
there
was
a
question,
but
because
the
jurisdictional
amount
wasn't
met,
the
claim
was
dismissed
and
it
was
because
of
the
yoda
case
that
they
felt
it
was
necessary
to
amend
the
law
by
giving
the
indians
the
right
to
sue
where
the
amount
was
less
than
10000
since
most
of
the
indians
claims,
being
individual,
were
less
than
10000
and
it
couldn't
group
for
more
of
them
to
get
jurisdiction.
now
yesterday,
your
honors
went
into
the
question
of
whether
plaintiffs
have
a
right
to
sue
in
new
york
state.
it
is
our
contention
that
plaintiffs
do
have
a
right
to
sue
new
york
state,
that
is
they
have
standing.
we
don't
concede
that
they
have
a
case
in
this.
now,
plaintiffs
say
that
they
don't
have
this
right.
we
maintain
that
new
york
state's
indian
laws
sections
5
and
11
(a),
give
them
that
right
to
sue
a
new
york
state.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
yes.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
right
now,
i
have
made
question.
i
think
i
call
your
attention
to
the
seneca
versus
christy
case
in
1891.
in
seneca
versus
christy,
the
seneca
nation
sued.
they
had
been
given
special
permission
by
a
new
york
state
statute
to
sue.
now,
new
york
state
upheld
their
right
to
sue,
but
decided
against
them.
if
decided
against
them
first
on
two
--
first
on
a
question
of
the
indian
nonintercourse
act.
it
stated
that
the
original
act
passed
in
1790
contained
a
statement,
“any
state
whether
having
the
right
of
preemption
to
such
grants
were
not
--
was
banned.
the
1790
--
they
went
in
under
1890,
1800
something
statute.
ours
is
the
1793
statute,
but
both
had
this
portion
deleted
and
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
at
that
time
held
that
the
deletion
of
these
words
indicated
that
the
congress
intended
that
the
preemption
state
should
not
be
barred
from
having
deals
with
the
indians
and
this,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
christy
case
shows
new
york
followed
for
over
a
hundred
years.
now
the
second
reason
why
the
indians
were
denied
relief
in
new
york
was
the
statute
of
imitations.
the
act
which
they
sued
under
said,
they
could
sue
to
the
same
extent
as
other
persons
and
statute
of
imitations
is
bar
for
anybody
who
brings
his
action
too
late
and
they
had.
now
there
is
similar
wording
in
new
york
state
in
the
indian
law,
section
5.
now,
seneca
was
appealed
to
the
united
sates
supreme
court
and
the
united
states
supreme
court
held
that
it
was
decided
on
two
issues.
one
of
them,
the
federal
question,
the
first
question
which
i
discussed
and
the
second
limitations
which
was
a
state
question
and
it's
said,
since
it
could
be
maintained
under
the
state
question,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
be
vacated
and
so
in
seneca,
in
the
seneca
case,
i
say
this
court
has
already
ruled
that
when
new
york
state
brands
the
right
sue,
there
isn't
a
right
to
sue.
now,
indian
law
section
5
was
first
enacted
in
1902,
that
was
right
after
the
seneca
case,
1892
rather.
in
1892,
the
new
york
state
land
commission
acting
through
the
attorney
general
issued
an
opinion
stating
that
the
law
gives
the
indians
the
right
to
rejectment
[to
the
same
extent
as
other
citizens].
here
the
action
is
basically
an
ejectment
action
and
in
an
ejectment
action
the
right
is
based
on
the
right
to
possession
of
property.
here
the
right
to
--
to
damages
would
only
be
because
they
were
being
denied
possession.
in
other
words
they
must
have
had
a
right
to
possession.
now
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
proponent
give
excerpts
from
an
affidavit
by
donald
c.
grennan
(ph)
an
assistant
attorney
general
and
in
that
case
he
took
the
position
at
that
time
that
there
was
no
capacity
to
sue
in
new
york
state.
however,
that
was
our
position
only
in
the
court
of
claims.
that
position
we
changed
and
because
we
found
we
were
wrong
and
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
it
says
as
follows
on
appeal
--
and
that
is
st.
regis
v.
state
of
new
york,
5
new
york
224
and
it
is
on
page
35.
on
this
appeal
the
state
concedes
that
the
claimants
have
capacity
to
sue.
they
do
not
argue
there
is
a
defect
in
indispensable
parties.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
st.
regis
is
cited
in
my
brief,
here.
now
if
they
sue
under
new
york
state
law
there
is
a
possibility
of
the
defense
of
the
statue
of
limitation.
as
matter
of
fact
standing
to
sue
--
to
sue
does
mean
that
they
are
going
to
win.
they
are
going
to
--
if
they
sue
in
state
of
new
york,
we
are
going
to
fight
like
the
duce
to
keep
them
from
winning
and
i
think
we
have
grounds,
the
merits
of
this,
but
we
would
not
raise
if
they
brought
an
action
against
the
state
in
the
court
of
claims,
we
would
not
raise
the
question
of
standing.
i
have
been
authorized
to
say
this
by
the
solicitor
general
of
the
state
of
new
york.
now
in
the
brief
plaintiffs
contend
further
that
the
new
york
state
--
that
the
right
to
sue
was
brought
about
because
of
25
u.s.c.
233.
now
25
u.s.c.
233
they
say
and
it
does,
contains
a
limitation
that
the
right
to
sue
is
for
actions
and
events
transpiring
after
september
13,
1972.
well!
let
us
say
assuming
they
are
right,
what
are
they
suing
for
here?
rent,
damages
in
a
form
of
rent
that
occurred
after
january
1,
1968,
a
course
of
action
accrues
after
the
deadline
date
of
1952
so
even
under
their
own
interpretation
of
the
statute
they
have
no
right
to
be
here
and
we
also
maintain
that
25
u.s.c.
made
it
mandatory
for
new
york
sate
to
permit
indians
to
sue
in
their
state
for
events
that
occurred
after
september
13,
1952,
but
it
didn't
prevent
us
from
giving
them
the
right
to
sue
for
events
that
occurred
prior
to
this.
this
we
say
we
could
do
and
that
we
did,
we
did
do
it
and
this
we
say
your
court
has
held
we
could
do
in
the
case
of
seneca
versus
christy.
now
plaintiffs
here
state
that
indian
law
section
11a
and
that
is
the
law
that
says
not
only
do
indians
have
the
right
to
sue
but
indian
tribes
and
indian
bands
have
the
right
to
sue
in
new
york
was
passed
as
a
result
of
25
u.s.c.233,
in
this
they
are
wrong.
this
is
not
the
section
that
was
passed.
the
section
that
was
passed
at
the
time
of
233
was
the
amendment
to
indian
law
section
5
and
we
have
a
letter
that
we
cite
the
contents
of
it
in
our
brief
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
the
government
at
the
time
that
was
being
enacted
and
it
says,
“the
bill
will
not
take
away
jurisdiction
from
the
peacemakers'
court
but
will
give
the
state
court's
concurrent
jurisdiction.”
this
step
is
authorized
by
congress
if
such
authority
was
needed
we
question
the
need
even
then
that
of
the
authority
to
--
and
we
maintain
that
we
could
grant
the
authority
and
they
refer
to
the
act
of
september
13,
1952,
25
u.s.c.
233
thus
it
was
the
amendment
to
section
5.
now
section
11a
was
passed
in
1958.
this
removes
any
doubt
on
their
right
to
sue
in
that
it
has
granted
the
right
to
not
only
to
individual
indians,
but
indian
tribes
and
indian
bands.
in
other
words,
the
--
whatever
the
status
of
an
indian
tribe
is
whether
corporate
or
not
corporate
or
whatever
it
is,
new
york
state
by
section
11a
recognizes
their
right
to
sue.
we
also
say
the
action
must
be
dismissed
because
there
is
another
action
pending
at
this
time
and
the
other
action
pending
is
the
claim
by
the
indians
before
the
indian
commission
that
was
cited
in
the
court's
result.
now
your
honors
were
questioning
my
opponent
here
on
whether
why
that
wasn't
a
duplication
of
damages.
i
do
not
see
why
it
isn't.
he
makes
some
sort
of
distinction.
he
says
that
before
the
indian
court
of
claims
all
they
could
get
is
the
damages
they
suffered
at
the
time
that
the
transaction
was
made,
actually
if
they
have.
united
states
has
given
them
the
right
to
sue
for
what
they
were
damaged
and
if
they
have
a
right
to
sue
for
the
damages
it
would
be
total
damages
including
interest
of
interest
are
damages
and
if
they
suffered
them.
now,
in
seneca
versus
united
states,
173
court
of
claims
912
and
in
several
other
cases,
the
united
states
court
of
claims
held
that
there
is
a
claim
in
favor
of
indians
for
--
under
circumstances
where
the
indian
tribe
sold
land
without
being
represented.
it
however
did
not
reach
the
question
of
whether
new
york
state
was
bound
by
the
nonintercourse
act
or
not,
it
cited
a
number
of
authorities
in
the
opinion
which
held
otherwise,
but
did
not
reach
a
conclusion.
now
we
also
maintain
here
that
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
defense.
the
defendants
here
are
the
counties
of
oneida
and
madison.
in
the
complaint
it
is
alleged
that
the
lands
were
used
for
the
building
roads
and
other
public
improvements.
the
use
of
property
by
a
county
in
the
governmental
capacity
is
protected
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
when
a
county
does
show
it
is
acting
for
the
state
and
as
such
it
enjoys
the
state's
immunity.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
i
am
not
sure
your
honor.
and
certainly
if
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
defense
here
then
the
indians
who
come
in
under
the
theory
of
either
as
showing
the
state
would
be
either
a
citizen
of
this
state
or
a
citizen
of
wisconsin,
in
either
case
under
the
carden
case
they
could
not
sue.
now
we
also
maintain
here
and
this
probably
would
only
go
in
the
event
your
honors
would
decide
that
they
have
original
jurisdiction
on
a
question
of
1362
and
might
be
referred
back
to
the
circuit
court
that
the
complaint
does
not
state
a
cause
of
action
and
one
of
the
things
i
want
to
call
to
your
honors'
attention
is
that
the
--
there
was
a
substantial
difference
as
it
was
cited
in
seneca
--
the
christy
--
in
the
christy
case
between
the
law
of
1790
and
the
law
of
1793.
the
law
of
1790
was
specifically
forbids
the
states
having
the
right
of
preemption
to
enter
into
agreement.
the
law
of
1793
which
was
a
law
in
effect
at
the
time
this
transaction
was
made
had
that
portion
deleted.
it
did
not
contain
this
band.
now
new
york
state
as
was
shown
in
christy
made
39
treaties
during
that
period
of
time
after
the
law
of
1793
went
into
effect
and
only
five
of
them
didn't
have
a
federal
commission
of
(inaudible).
now
the
united
state
recognized
this.
the
united
states
in
many
cases
granted
substitute
grants
to
the
indians
who
had
sold
to
the
united
states,
they
passively
approve
this.
the
indians
made
no
complaint.
we
have
almost
200
years
that
have
gone
by
and
a
practical
construction
such
as
we
had
here
which
the
parties
have
undertaken
for
such
a
long
period
of
time
should
not
be
changed
even
if
there
is
an
equally
tenable
interpretation
the
other
way.
in
the
instance
case
i
say
this
is
very
necessary
because
if
we
follow
through
the
fruits
of
a
decision
against
us
we
would
really
have
an
economic
upheaval
in
all
of
the
preemption
states
where
deals
were
made
for
the
purchase
of
land
probably
about
200
years
ago
and
it
would
be
upsetting
titles
all
over
the
eastern
part
of
the
country,
thank
you.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
may
it
please
the
court?
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
yes,
sir.
i
represent
new
york
state
which
is
amicus
in
this
case.
now,
this
certiorari
rises
here
from
the
dismissal
of
their
complaint.
now,
their
complaint
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
contained
11
separate
grounds
and
they
are
grouped
into
four
basic
groups.
the
first
was
lack
of
original
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
the
second
was,
the
controversy
was
in
fact
against
the
state
of
new
york
and
united
states
and
not
against
these
defendants.
thirdly,
that
there
was
an
identical
claim
pending
against
united
states
before
the
indian
land
commission.
and
lastly,
about
the
complaint
fail
--
an
amended
complaint
fail
to
state
a
course
of
action.
if
i
believe
not
only
before
your
honors
is
the
question
of
the
jurisdiction
but
all
of
those
because
this
was
what
the
motion
originally
was
made
for
and
this
was
the
motion
that
was
granted.
now,
to
succeed
here
therefore
it
is
my
contention
that
they
must
establish
one,
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
two,
the
right
to
sue
the
defendants
who
are
holding
the
lands
in
this
case
for
the
benefit
of
the
people
in
the
state
of
new
york
or
the
people
of
the
state
of
new
york
in
the
governmental
capacity.
three,
their
right
to
maintain
this
action
despite
the
fact
that
as
the
court
belong
noted
that
there
was
pending
before
the
indian
lands
commission
have
claimed
for
damages
which
would
include
these
damages
unless
they
brought
back
complaints
basic
course
of
action.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
the
court
of
appeals’
main
--
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
the
court
of
appeals,
they
will
mainly
without
the
court
noted
the
other
action
pending
in
its
opinion
and
but
basically
before
they
can
be
in
the
federal
court,
they
must
have
a
good
complaint.
if
the
complaint
fails
its
jurisdiction
of
it
and
--
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
no.
basically,
this
was
the
--
the
court
went
on
jurisdiction.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
now,
it’s
our
contention
here
first
that
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
is
--
they
contend
that
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
is
inapplicable
to
the
28
u.s.c.
1362.
despite
the
fact
that
it’s
always
been
held
to
be
applicable
to
1331
(a).
both
of
these
are
jurisdictional
sections
and
provide
that
the
course
in
action
must
arise
under
the
constitution
laws
and
treaties
of
the
united
states.
the
same
language
was
used
in
both
and
there
was
no
change
of
this
in
the
language.
the
difference
within
one
was
that
at
the
claim
must
exceed
10,000
and
the
other
that
the
claim
must
be
brought
by
an
indian.
now,
these
statutes
are
in
pari
materia,
the
same
language
was
used.
the
court
--
when
congress
uses
the
same
language
and
that
language
has
been
always
interpreted
to
include
the
best,
the
complaint
rule,
then
it
is
certainly
was
meant
to
include
it
in
this
case
too.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
red
light
went
on
yesterday,
we
were
talking
about
section
1331
(a)
and
1362
being
in
pari
materia
and
i
maintain
that
if
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
was
applicable
to
1331
(a)
it
must
also
be
applicable
to
1362.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
senate
report
and
i
got
a
quote
here
from
it,
that
was
made
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
these
bills
and
the
house
report
contains
similar
language
says,
“the
purpose
of
the
bill
as
amended
is
to
permit
indian
tribes
to
bring
civil
actions
arising
under
the
constitution
treaties
and
laws
of
the
united
states
without
regard
to
the
$10,000.00
limitation
and
accordingly
amends
chapter
85
title
28
united
states
code
by
adding
new
section.”
now,
the
same
reports
and
i
got
it
as
an
appendix
to
my
brief
states
that
the
reason
this
was
necessary
or
came
about
was
a
federal
case
yoda(ph)
against
asian
born(ph)
339
f2
360.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
there
was
federal
question
but
because
the
jurisdictional
amount
wasn’t
met,
the
claim
was
dismissed
and
it
was
because
of
the
yoda
case
that
they
felt
it
was
necessary
to
amend
the
law
by
giving
the
indians
the
right
to
sue
where
the
amount
was
less
than
$10,000.00,
since
most
of
the
indian
claims
being
individual
was
less
than
$10,000.00
and
they
could
not
group
them
or
take
them
to
get
jurisdiction.
now
yesterday,
your
honors
went
into
the
question
of
whether
the
plaintiffs
have
a
right
to
sue
in
new
york
state.
it
is
our
contention
that
plaintiffs
do
have
a
right
to
sue
in
new
york
state
that
is
if
they
have
standing.
we
do
not
concede
that
they
have
a
case
in
this.
now,
plaintiffs
say
that
they
do
not
have
this
right.
we
maintain
that
new
york
states
indian
law
sections
5
and
11
(a)
given
that
right
to
sue
a
new
york
state.
now
--
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
yes.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
alright
now,
on
that
question
i
think
i
call
your
attention
to
the
seneca
versus
christy
case
in
1891.
in
seneca
versus
christy,
the
seneca
nation
sued.
they
have
been
given
special
permission
by
a
new
york
state
statute
to
sue.
now,
new
york
state
upheld
their
right
to
sue
but
decided
against
them.
it's
decided
against
them
first
on
a
question
of
the
indian
nonintercourse
act.
it
stated
that
the
original
act
passed
in
1790
contained
a
statement
any
state
where
they
have
the
right
of
preemption
to
such
answer
or
not
was
banned.
the
1790
--
they
went
in
under
1800
something
statute.
ours
is
the
1793
statute
but
both
had
this
portion
deleted
and
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
at
that
time
held
that
the
deletion
of
these
words
indicated,
that
the
congress
intended
that
the
preemption
state
should
not
be
barred
from
having
deals
with
the
indians,
and
this
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
christy
case
shows
new
york
followed
over
a
hundred
years.
now,
the
second
reason
why
the
indians
would
deny
relief
in
new
york
was
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
act
which
they
sued
under
said
they
could
sue
to
the
same
extent
as
other
persons
and
statute
of
limitations
is
about
for
anybody
who
brings
his
action
too
late
and
they
had.
now,
there
is
similar
wedding
in
new
york
state
indian
law
section
5.
now,
seneca
was
appealed
to
the
united
states
supreme
court
and
the
united
states
supreme
court
held
that
it
was
decided
on
two
issues.
one
of
them
the
federal
question,
the
first
question
which
i
discussed
and
the
second
limitation
which
was
a
state
question
and
it
said,
since
it
could
be
maintained
under
a
state
question,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
be
vacated
and
so,
in
the
seneca
case
i
say
this
court
has
already
ruled
that
when
new
york
state
grants
the
right
to
sue,
there
is
the
right
to
sue.
now,
indian
law
section
5
was
first
enacted
in
1902
that
was
right
after
the
seneca
case,
1892
rather.
in
1902,
the
new
york
state
land
commission
acting
through
the
attorney
general
issued
an
opinion
stating
that
“the
law
gives
the
indians
the
right
to
ejectment
in
courts
of
record
to
the
same
extent
as
other
citizens.”
here
the
action
is
basically
an
ejectment
action,
in
an
ejectment
action
the
right
is
based
on
the
right
to
possession
of
property.
here
there
right
to
damages
would
only
be
because
they
were
being
denied
possession.
in
other
words,
they
must
have
had
a
right
to
possession.
now,
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
proponents
give
excerpts
from
a
affidavit
by
donald
segun(ph),
an
assistant
attorney
general,
and
in
that
case
he
took
the
position
at
that
time
that
there
was
no
capacity
to
sue
in
new
york's
state.
however,
that
was
our
position
only
in
the
court
of
claims
that
position
we
changed
and
because
we
found
we
were
wrong,
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
it
says
as
follows,
and
that’s
saint
bridget’s(ph)
versus
state
of
new
york,
5
new
york
second
24,
and
that’s
on
page
35.
on
this
appeal,
the
state
concedes
that
the
claimants
have
capacity
to
sue.
they
do
not
argue
if
there
is
a
defect
in
indispensable
parties.
so,--
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
saint
bridget’s
is
cited
in
my
brief
here.
now,
if
they
sue
under
new
york
state
law,
there
is
a
possibility
of
the
defense
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
standing
to
sue
does
not
mean
that
they
are
going
to
win.
if
they
sue
us
in
the
state
of
new
york,
we
are
going
to
fight
like
to
dues
to
keep
them
from
winning
and
i
think
we
have
grounds,
the
merits
of
this
but
we
would
not
raise
if
they
brought
an
action
against
the
state
in
the
court
of
claims,
we
would
not
raise
the
questions
of
standing.
i
have
been
authorized
to
say
this
by
the
solicitor
general
of
the
state
of
new
york.
now
in
the
brief,
plaintiffs
contend
further
that
the
new
york
state,
that
the
right
to
sue
was
brought
about
because
of
25
u.s.c.
233.
now,
25
u.s.c.
233
they
say
and
it
does
contain
a
limitation
that
the
right
to
sue
is
for
actions
and
events
transpiring,
if
the
september
13,
1952.
well,
let’s
say
assuming
their
right,
what
are
they
suing
for
here?
rent?
damages
in
the
form
of
rent
that
occurred
after
january
1,
1968.
the
course
of
action
accrues
after
the
deadline
date
of
1952.
so
even
on
the
rent
own
interpretation
of
a
statute,
they
have
no
right
to
be
here
and
we
also
maintain
that
25
u.s.c.
made
it
mandatory
for
new
york
state
to
permit
indians
to
sue
in
their
state
for
events
that
occurred
after
september
13,
1952.
but
it
did
not
prevent
us
from
giving
him
the
right
to
sue
for
events
that
occurred
prior
to
this.
this
we
say
we
could
do
and
that
we
did
do
it
and
this
we
say,
your
court
has
held
we
could
do
in
the
case
of
seneca
versus
christy.
now,
plaintiffs
here
state
that
indian
law
section
11
(a)
and
that’s
the
law
that
says,
not
only
do
indians
have
the
right
to
sue
but
indian
tribes
and
indian
bands
have
the
right
to
sue
in
new
york
was
passed
as
a
result
of
25
u.s.c.
233.
in
this
they
are
wrong.
this
is
not
the
section
that
was
passed.
the
section
was
passed
at
the
time
of
233
was
the
amendment
to
indian
law
section
5,
and
we
have
a
letter
that
we
cite
the
contents
of
it
in
our
own
brief,
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
the
government
at
the
time
that
was
been
enacted
and
it
says,
“the
bill
will
not
take
away
jurisdiction
from
the
peacemakers
court
but
we
will
give
the
state
court’s
concurrent
jurisdiction.
this
step
is
authorized
by
congress,
if
such
authority
was
needed
we
question
the
need
even
then
that
of
the
authority
too
and
we
maintain
that
we
could
grant
the
authority.”
and
they
referred
to
the
act
of
september
13,
1952,
25
u.s.c.
233.
thus,
it
was
the
amendment
to
section
5.
now
section
11
(a)
was
passed
in
1958.
this
removes
any
doubt
on
their
right
to
sue,
in
it,
it
has
granted
the
right
to
not
only
to
individual
indians
but
indian
tribes
and
indian
bands.
in
other
words,
whatever
the
status
of
an
indian
tribe
is
whether
corporate
or
not
corporate
or
whatever
it
is,
new
york
state
by
section
of
11
(a)
recognizes
there
right
to
sue.
we
also
say
the
action
must
be
dismissed
because
there
is
another
action
pending
at
this
time
and
the
other
action
pending
is
the
claim
by
the
indians
before
the
indian
commissioners
and
it
was
cited
in
the
court
below.
now,
your
honors
were
questioning
my
opponent
here
on
whether,
why
that
was
not
a
duplication
of
damages?
i
do
not
see
why
it
isn’t.
he
makes
some
sort
of
distinction
he
says
that
before
the
indian
court
of
claims,
all
they
could
get
is
the
damages
they
suffered
at
the
time
that
the
transaction
was
made.
actually,
if
they
have,
united
states
has
giving
them
the
right
to
sue
for
what
they
were
damaged
and
if
they
have
a
right
to
sue
for
the
damages,
it
would
be
total
damages
including
increase
of
interest
are
damages
and
if
they
suffer
them.
now,
in
seneca
versus
united
states
173
court
of
claims
912
and
then
several
other
cases,
the
united
states
court
of
claims
held
that
there
is
a
claim
in
favor
of
indians
for
--
under
circumstances
where
the
indian
tribe
sold
land
without
being
represented.
it
however,
did
not
reach
the
question
of
whether
new
york
state
was
bound
by
the
nonintercourse
act
or
not.
it
cited
a
number
of
authorities
in
the
opinion
which
held
otherwise
but
didn’t
reach
a
conclusion.
now,
we
also
maintain
here
that
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
defense.
the
defendants
here
are
the
counties
of
oneida
and
madison.
in
the
complaint,
it
is
alleged
that
the
lands
were
used
for
the
building
of
roads
and
other
public
improvements.
the
use
of
the
property
by
a
county
in
a
governmental
capacity
is
protected
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
when
a
county
does
so,
it
is
acting
for
the
state
and
as
such
it
enjoys
the
state’s
immunity.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
i
am
not
sure
your
honor
on
that.
and
certainly,
if
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
defense
here,
then
the
indians
who
would
come
in
under
the
theory
of
either
as
suing
the
state
would
be
either
a
citizen
of
this
state
or
a
citizen
of
wisconsin
in
either
case
under
the
parton(ph)
case
they
could
not
sue.
now,
we
also
maintain
here
and
this
probably
would
only
go
in
the
event,
your
honors,
would
decide
that
they
have
a
original
jurisdiction
on
the
question
of
1362
and
might
be
referred
back
to
the
circuit
court,
that
a
complaint
does
not
state
the
course
of
action.
and
one
other
things
i
want
to
call
to
your
honors’
attention
is
that
there
was
a
substantial
difference
as
it
was
cited
in
seneca
v.
christy
case
between
the
law
of
1790
and
the
law
of
1793.
the
law
of
1790
was
specifically
forbad
states
having
the
right
of
preemption
to
enter
to
an
agreement.
the
law
of
1793
which
was
a
law
in
effect
at
the
time
this
transaction
was
made
had
that
portion
deleted.
it
did
not
contain
this
ban.
now,
new
york
state
as
was
shown
in
christy
made
39
treaties
during
that
period
of
time
after
the
law
of
1793
went
into
effect
and
only
five
of
them
did
not
have
a
federal
commission
of
(inaudible).
now,
the
united
states
recognized
this,
the
united
states
in
many
cases
granted
substitute
lands
to
the
indians
who
have
sold
to
the
united
states,
they
passively
approved
this.
the
indians
made
no
complaint,
we
have
almost
200
years
that
have
gone
by
and
a
practical
construction
such
as
we
had
here
which
the
parties
have
undertaken
for
such
a
long
period
of
time
should
not
be
change
even
if
there
is
and
equally
tenable
interpretation
the
other
way.
in
the
instant
case,
i
say
this
is
very
necessary
because
if
we
follow
through
the
fruits
of
a
decision
against
us,
we
would
really
have
an
economic
upheaval
in
all
of
the
preemption
states
where
deals
were
made
for
the
purchase
of
land
probably
about
200
years
ago,
and
it
would
be
upsetting
titles
all
over
the
eastern
part
of
the
country.
thank
you.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
red
light
went
on
yesterday,
we
were
talking
about
sections
31
(a),
1331
(a)
and
1362
being
empower
material.
i
maintained
that
if
the
well
preeded
complaint
rule
is
applicable
to
1331(a),
it
must
also
be
applicable
to
1362.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
senate
report
and
i
have
got
a
quote
here
from
it
that
was
made
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
these
bills
and
house
report
constrains
similar
language
says,
the
purpose
of
the
bill
as
a
mandate
is
to
permit
indian
tribes
to
bring
civil
actions
arising
onto
the
constitution,
treaties
and
laws
of
the
united
states
without
regard
to
the
$10,000
limitation
and
accordingly
amended
chapter
85
title
28,
united
states
code
by
adding
a
new
section.
now,
the
same
report
and
i
have
got
it
in
as
an
appendix
to
my
brief,
states
that
the
reason
this
was
necessary
or
came
about
was
a
federal
case
yoder
against
assiniboine.
339
f2
360.
in
that
case,
the
court
held
there
was
a
question,
but
because
the
jurisdictional
amount
wasn't
met,
the
claim
was
dismissed
and
it
was
because
of
the
yoda
case
that
they
felt
it
was
necessary
to
amend
the
law
by
giving
the
indians
the
right
to
sue
where
the
amount
was
less
than
10000
since
most
of
the
indians
claims,
being
individual,
were
less
than
10000
and
it
couldn't
group
for
more
of
them
to
get
jurisdiction.
now
yesterday,
your
honors
went
into
the
question
of
whether
plaintiffs
have
a
right
to
sue
in
new
york
state.
it
is
our
contention
that
plaintiffs
do
have
a
right
to
sue
new
york
state,
that
is
they
have
standing.
we
don't
concede
that
they
have
a
case
in
this.
now,
plaintiffs
say
that
they
don't
have
this
right.
we
maintain
that
new
york
state's
indian
laws
sections
5
and
11
(a),
give
them
that
right
to
sue
a
new
york
state.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
yes.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
right
now,
i
have
made
question.
i
think
i
call
your
attention
to
the
seneca
versus
christy
case
in
1891.
in
seneca
versus
christy,
the
seneca
nation
sued.
they
had
been
given
special
permission
by
a
new
york
state
statute
to
sue.
now,
new
york
state
upheld
their
right
to
sue,
but
decided
against
them.
if
decided
against
them
first
on
two
--
first
on
a
question
of
the
indian
nonintercourse
act.
it
stated
that
the
original
act
passed
in
1790
contained
a
statement,
“any
state
whether
having
the
right
of
preemption
to
such
grants
were
not
--
was
banned.
the
1790
--
they
went
in
under
1890,
1800
something
statute.
ours
is
the
1793
statute,
but
both
had
this
portion
deleted
and
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
at
that
time
held
that
the
deletion
of
these
words
indicated
that
the
congress
intended
that
the
preemption
state
should
not
be
barred
from
having
deals
with
the
indians
and
this,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
christy
case
shows
new
york
followed
for
over
a
hundred
years.
now
the
second
reason
why
the
indians
were
denied
relief
in
new
york
was
the
statute
of
imitations.
the
act
which
they
sued
under
said,
they
could
sue
to
the
same
extent
as
other
persons
and
statute
of
imitations
is
bar
for
anybody
who
brings
his
action
too
late
and
they
had.
now
there
is
similar
wording
in
new
york
state
in
the
indian
law,
section
5.
now,
seneca
was
appealed
to
the
united
sates
supreme
court
and
the
united
states
supreme
court
held
that
it
was
decided
on
two
issues.
one
of
them,
the
federal
question,
the
first
question
which
i
discussed
and
the
second
limitations
which
was
a
state
question
and
it's
said,
since
it
could
be
maintained
under
the
state
question,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
would
not
be
vacated
and
so
in
seneca,
in
the
seneca
case,
i
say
this
court
has
already
ruled
that
when
new
york
state
brands
the
right
sue,
there
isn't
a
right
to
sue.
now,
indian
law
section
5
was
first
enacted
in
1902,
that
was
right
after
the
seneca
case,
1892
rather.
in
1892,
the
new
york
state
land
commission
acting
through
the
attorney
general
issued
an
opinion
stating
that
the
law
gives
the
indians
the
right
to
rejectment
[to
the
same
extent
as
other
citizens].
here
the
action
is
basically
an
ejectment
action
and
in
an
ejectment
action
the
right
is
based
on
the
right
to
possession
of
property.
here
the
right
to
--
to
damages
would
only
be
because
they
were
being
denied
possession.
in
other
words
they
must
have
had
a
right
to
possession.
now
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
the
proponent
give
excerpts
from
an
affidavit
by
donald
c.
grennan
(ph)
an
assistant
attorney
general
and
in
that
case
he
took
the
position
at
that
time
that
there
was
no
capacity
to
sue
in
new
york
state.
however,
that
was
our
position
only
in
the
court
of
claims.
that
position
we
changed
and
because
we
found
we
were
wrong
and
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
it
says
as
follows
on
appeal
--
and
that
is
st.
regis
v.
state
of
new
york,
5
new
york
224
and
it
is
on
page
35.
on
this
appeal
the
state
concedes
that
the
claimants
have
capacity
to
sue.
they
do
not
argue
there
is
a
defect
in
indispensable
parties.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
st.
regis
is
cited
in
my
brief,
here.
now
if
they
sue
under
new
york
state
law
there
is
a
possibility
of
the
defense
of
the
statue
of
limitation.
as
matter
of
fact
standing
to
sue
--
to
sue
does
mean
that
they
are
going
to
win.
they
are
going
to
--
if
they
sue
in
state
of
new
york,
we
are
going
to
fight
like
the
duce
to
keep
them
from
winning
and
i
think
we
have
grounds,
the
merits
of
this,
but
we
would
not
raise
if
they
brought
an
action
against
the
state
in
the
court
of
claims,
we
would
not
raise
the
question
of
standing.
i
have
been
authorized
to
say
this
by
the
solicitor
general
of
the
state
of
new
york.
now
in
the
brief
plaintiffs
contend
further
that
the
new
york
state
--
that
the
right
to
sue
was
brought
about
because
of
25
u.s.c.
233.
now
25
u.s.c.
233
they
say
and
it
does,
contains
a
limitation
that
the
right
to
sue
is
for
actions
and
events
transpiring
after
september
13,
1972.
well!
let
us
say
assuming
they
are
right,
what
are
they
suing
for
here?
rent,
damages
in
a
form
of
rent
that
occurred
after
january
1,
1968,
a
course
of
action
accrues
after
the
deadline
date
of
1952
so
even
under
their
own
interpretation
of
the
statute
they
have
no
right
to
be
here
and
we
also
maintain
that
25
u.s.c.
made
it
mandatory
for
new
york
sate
to
permit
indians
to
sue
in
their
state
for
events
that
occurred
after
september
13,
1952,
but
it
didn't
prevent
us
from
giving
them
the
right
to
sue
for
events
that
occurred
prior
to
this.
this
we
say
we
could
do
and
that
we
did,
we
did
do
it
and
this
we
say
your
court
has
held
we
could
do
in
the
case
of
seneca
versus
christy.
now
plaintiffs
here
state
that
indian
law
section
11a
and
that
is
the
law
that
says
not
only
do
indians
have
the
right
to
sue
but
indian
tribes
and
indian
bands
have
the
right
to
sue
in
new
york
was
passed
as
a
result
of
25
u.s.c.233,
in
this
they
are
wrong.
this
is
not
the
section
that
was
passed.
the
section
that
was
passed
at
the
time
of
233
was
the
amendment
to
indian
law
section
5
and
we
have
a
letter
that
we
cite
the
contents
of
it
in
our
brief
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
to
the
government
at
the
time
that
was
being
enacted
and
it
says,
“the
bill
will
not
take
away
jurisdiction
from
the
peacemakers'
court
but
will
give
the
state
court's
concurrent
jurisdiction.”
this
step
is
authorized
by
congress
if
such
authority
was
needed
we
question
the
need
even
then
that
of
the
authority
to
--
and
we
maintain
that
we
could
grant
the
authority
and
they
refer
to
the
act
of
september
13,
1952,
25
u.s.c.
233
thus
it
was
the
amendment
to
section
5.
now
section
11a
was
passed
in
1958.
this
removes
any
doubt
on
their
right
to
sue
in
that
it
has
granted
the
right
to
not
only
to
individual
indians,
but
indian
tribes
and
indian
bands.
in
other
words,
the
--
whatever
the
status
of
an
indian
tribe
is
whether
corporate
or
not
corporate
or
whatever
it
is,
new
york
state
by
section
11a
recognizes
their
right
to
sue.
we
also
say
the
action
must
be
dismissed
because
there
is
another
action
pending
at
this
time
and
the
other
action
pending
is
the
claim
by
the
indians
before
the
indian
commission
that
was
cited
in
the
court's
result.
now
your
honors
were
questioning
my
opponent
here
on
whether
why
that
wasn't
a
duplication
of
damages.
i
do
not
see
why
it
isn't.
he
makes
some
sort
of
distinction.
he
says
that
before
the
indian
court
of
claims
all
they
could
get
is
the
damages
they
suffered
at
the
time
that
the
transaction
was
made,
actually
if
they
have.
united
states
has
given
them
the
right
to
sue
for
what
they
were
damaged
and
if
they
have
a
right
to
sue
for
the
damages
it
would
be
total
damages
including
interest
of
interest
are
damages
and
if
they
suffered
them.
now,
in
seneca
versus
united
states,
173
court
of
claims
912
and
in
several
other
cases,
the
united
states
court
of
claims
held
that
there
is
a
claim
in
favor
of
indians
for
--
under
circumstances
where
the
indian
tribe
sold
land
without
being
represented.
it
however
did
not
reach
the
question
of
whether
new
york
state
was
bound
by
the
nonintercourse
act
or
not,
it
cited
a
number
of
authorities
in
the
opinion
which
held
otherwise,
but
did
not
reach
a
conclusion.
now
we
also
maintain
here
that
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
defense.
the
defendants
here
are
the
counties
of
oneida
and
madison.
in
the
complaint
it
is
alleged
that
the
lands
were
used
for
the
building
roads
and
other
public
improvements.
the
use
of
property
by
a
county
in
the
governmental
capacity
is
protected
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
when
a
county
does
show
it
is
acting
for
the
state
and
as
such
it
enjoys
the
state's
immunity.
mr.
jeremiah
jochnowitz
i
am
not
sure
your
honor.
and
certainly
if
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
defense
here
then
the
indians
who
come
in
under
the
theory
of
either
as
showing
the
state
would
be
either
a
citizen
of
this
state
or
a
citizen
of
wisconsin,
in
either
case
under
the
carden
case
they
could
not
sue.
now
we
also
maintain
here
and
this
probably
would
only
go
in
the
event
your
honors
would
decide
that
they
have
original
jurisdiction
on
a
question
of
1362
and
might
be
referred
back
to
the
circuit
court
that
the
complaint
does
not
state
a
cause
of
action
and
one
of
the
things
i
want
to
call
to
your
honors'
attention
is
that
the
--
there
was
a
substantial
difference
as
it
was
cited
in
seneca
--
the
christy
--
in
the
christy
case
between
the
law
of
1790
and
the
law
of
1793.
the
law
of
1790
was
specifically
forbids
the
states
having
the
right
of
preemption
to
enter
into
agreement.
the
law
of
1793
which
was
a
law
in
effect
at
the
time
this
transaction
was
made
had
that
portion
deleted.
it
did
not
contain
this
band.
now
new
york
state
as
was
shown
in
christy
made
39
treaties
during
that
period
of
time
after
the
law
of
1793
went
into
effect
and
only
five
of
them
didn't
have
a
federal
commission
of
(inaudible).
now
the
united
state
recognized
this.
the
united
states
in
many
cases
granted
substitute
grants
to
the
indians
who
had
sold
to
the
united
states,
they
passively
approve
this.
the
indians
made
no
complaint.
we
have
almost
200
years
that
have
gone
by
and
a
practical
construction
such
as
we
had
here
which
the
parties
have
undertaken
for
such
a
long
period
of
time
should
not
be
changed
even
if
there
is
an
equally
tenable
interpretation
the
other
way.
in
the
instance
case
i
say
this
is
very
necessary
because
if
we
follow
through
the
fruits
of
a
decision
against
us
we
would
really
have
an
economic
upheaval
in
all
of
the
preemption
states
where
deals
were
made
for
the
purchase
of
land
probably
about
200
years
ago
and
it
would
be
upsetting
titles
all
over
the
eastern
part
of
the
country,
thank
you.
