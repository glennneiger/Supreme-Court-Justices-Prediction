unknown
speaker
when
you
say
equitable-type
action,
it
deals
with
real
estate,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
so
is
it
something
of
a
nature
of
acquired
title
action?
unknown
speaker
unless
they
will
leave
if
they
want?
unknown
speaker
no
declaration
of
title
as
in
the
tribe?
unknown
speaker
but
underlying
at
all,
it
has
to
be
some
kind
of
declaration
that
--
unknown
speaker
--
title
is
in
the
tribe?
unknown
speaker
and
that,
but
they
would
say
those
now
in
possession
may
remain
but
someone
ought
to
account
them
for
some
rental
value
or
something
else?
unknown
speaker
you
are
not
contempt
to
be
in
state
court?
unknown
speaker
i
take
that
your
opposition
will
disagree
with
you?
unknown
speaker
and
you
haven’t
tried?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
federal
agency
representing
you
here?
unknown
speaker
you
got
it
before
the
indian
claims
commission?
unknown
speaker
for
the
value
of
what?
unknown
speaker
does
it
concern
the
same
property?
unknown
speaker
so
you
--
and
is
there
any
contest
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
indian
claims
commission?
unknown
speaker
or/and
so
the
question
is,
was
there
some
unfair
dealing
at
the
time?
and
if
so,
how
much
is
it
worth?
unknown
speaker
well,
can’t
you
get
in
that
case
possessing
the
relief
that
you
are
asking
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
why
is
this?
i
thought
the
indian
claims
commission
had
rather
broad
discretion
to
and
if
they
determine
it,
it
has
been
unfair
as
to
the
indian?
unknown
speaker
in
telling
and
saying
who
has
to
pay
and
how
much?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
that
is
the
remedy
that
congress
has
provided
in
these
separate
categories?
unknown
speaker
and
you
want
an
addition,
i
gather.
something
you
call
fair
market
value
or
something
like
that?
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
you
have
said
1795?
unknown
speaker
but
this
claim
you
have
here
for
which
you
say
it’s
for
a
violation
of
treaty
could
be
place
before
the
indian
claims
commission
clearly?
unknown
speaker
that’s
what
i
want
to
know.
unknown
speaker
the
commission
can
just
give
relief
against
the
government,
can
it?
unknown
speaker
they
can’t
give
relief
against
a
private
party?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
well,
the
merits
of
this
controversy
aren’t
before
us
at
all,
have
we?
unknown
speaker
(voice
overlap)
we
have
to
know
about
the
case
to
know
that
it
comes
under
a
volume
28
of
the
united
states
code
1362.
unknown
speaker
it
is
a
case
brought
by
any
indian
tribe
or
band
with
a
governing
body
duly
recognized.
that’s
all
we
need
to
know
about
the
merits
of
this
case
(voice
overlap)
even
that
is
a
purely
a
matter
–-
unknown
speaker
--
of
thorough
jurisdiction,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
always
i
ask
question
further,
it
provided
some
another
argument
about
whether
a
federal
court
should
proceed
with
the
case
at
all.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
don’t
but
i
was
asking?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shattuck.
unknown
speaker
i
have
to
have
perhaps
lack
of
knowledge
is
the
best
way
to
understand
about
the
rights
of
indians
to
sue
in
state
courts.
i
take
it
that
an
individual
indians
they
could
go
into
this
supreme
court
one
of
the
new
york
counties
and
sue
for
a
divorce
from
his
wife
without
any
grant
of
authority
to
the
court
from
congress,
couldn’t
he?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
matter
of
new
york
law
or
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
back
to
a
case
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
either
new
mexico
or
arizona
the
court
called
the
begay
versus
begay
some
30
years
ago
saying
that
the
state
courts
of
one
of
those
dates
had
to
afford
an
indian
who
sought
a
divorce
--
a
divorce
and
i
do
not
recall
that
is
depending
on
federal
law
in
anyway.
unknown
speaker
so,
that
then
it
would
have
been
a
matter
of
new
york
law
that
said
in
effect,
indians
cannot
raise
particular
kind
of
claims
that
they
might
want
to
raise
in
new
york
courts.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
expect
if
you
could
--
unknown
speaker
we've
established
that
congress
in
enacting
1362
meant
to
let
you
in
the
federal
courts
that
is
the
end
of
case,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
if
you
do
not
have
to
worry
about
this
well-pleaded
complaint.
unknown
speaker
our
notion
is
involve
with
1331
because
the
legislative
history
says,
that
congress
meant
you
can
get
in
the
court
under
1362?
unknown
speaker
yes.
you
haven’t
argued
it
yet?
unknown
speaker
we
did
more
than
simply
eliminate
--
unknown
speaker
for
purposes
of
this
kind
of
case.
the
jurisdictional
amount--
unknown
speaker
it
went
beyond
that
--
unknown
speaker
well-pleaded
complaint
and
everything
else
in
a
way
of
requirement
sort
of
abolish
as
to
indians
of
lawsuits.
unknown
speaker
isn’t
that
language
in
for
other
purposes
almost
boiler
plate
in
that
type
of
the
situational
that
a
legislature
almost
always
puts
in
just
to
make
sure
they
do
not
have
the
title
to
narrow?
unknown
speaker
then
you
don’t
suggest
that
it
was
a
conscious,
deliberate
choice
on
the
part
of
congress?
unknown
speaker
pretty
old
rule.
unknown
speaker
now,
that
again
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
case
that
you
(voice
overlap)?
unknown
speaker
that
gives
you
your
assertive
right
to
possession
but
in
which
entitle
you
to
bring
this
to
an
action
of
ejectment.
but
you’re
still
right
up
against
the
same
settled
established
long
ago
rule
of
a
federal
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
unless
you
said
it
so
that
1362
means
something
else
--
unknown
speaker
--
than
1331.
that
is
really
what
the
case
is
about,
isn’t
it?
as
my
brother
brennan
is
suggesting?
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
really
placing
much
reliance
on
1331?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jochnowitz.
unknown
speaker
my
mistake
in
having
the
impression
that
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
only
with
the
question
of
federal
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
these
question
the
other
branches
of
your
motions?
unknown
speaker
am
i
mistaken
in
my
impression?
unknown
speaker
so
if
we
disagreed
with
the
court
appeals
on
that
we
would
presumably
remand
the
case
to
that
court
to
consider
the
other
branches
of
your
motion,
wouldn’t
we?
unknown
speaker
mr.
jochnowitz.
unknown
speaker
is
it
enough
that
new
york
states
indian
law
gives
the
petitioners
here
the
right
to
sue
or
do
you
have
to
show
to
the
federal
law
that
was
new
york
court’s
the
authority
to
entertain
such
as
this?
unknown
speaker
is
that
cited
on
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
that
contention
foreclosed
by
r.
moore
against
alameda
county
decision
last
year?
didn’t
we
say
that
a
county
doesn’t
partake
of
the
state’s
immunity
enough
to
invoke
the
eleventh
amendment
and
cites
them
all
the
cases
of
this
court?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
equitable-type
action,
it
deals
with
real
estate,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
so
is
it
something
of
a
