mr.
george
c.
shattuck
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
oneida
indians
of
new
york
state
and
the
oneida
indians
of
wisconsin,
in
a
suit
against
madison
on
oneida
counties
of
new
york
state.
this
is
an
equitable-type
action
concerning
the
lands
currently
being
used
by
the
defendant’s
counties
but
allegedly
owned
by
the
oneida
indians.
the
sole
issue
on
this
appeal
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
to
hear
this
type
of
case.
the
complaint
alleges
and
recites
three
treaties
and
one
statute
under
which
the
united
states
has
guaranteed
to
the
plaintiffs,
the
possession
of
the
reservation
including
the
land
which
we
are
now
talking
about.
the
complaint
further
alleges
that
in
the
year
1795,
the
state
of
new
york
acquired
the
land
in
question
illegally
in
contravention
of
the
treaties
and
in
contravention
of
the
state
law
for
the
federal
law,
excuse
me,
which
holds
that
no
purchase
of
indian
lands
without
the
consent
of
united
states
shall
be
of
any
validity
in
law
or
equity.
the
complaint
also
alleges
that
the
price
we
receive
was
unconscionable
and
inadequate.
it
alleges
that
the
value
of
the
land
was
misrepresented
to
the
indians.
it
alleges
that
at
the
time
the
sale
took
place
the
indians,
the
plaintiffs
could
not
read
or
write.
it
alleges
that
two
years
after
the
purchase
of
the
state,
the
land
was
resold
at
a
profit
of
approximately
500%,
i
might
point
out
that
this
resale
of
land
was
in
the
main
to
developers
who
resold
shortly
after
at
a
further
profit.
the
complaint
also
alleges
that
the
consent
of
the
united
states
was
neither
sought
nor
obtained
by
the
state
to
the
sale,
and
further,
that
the
state
knew
of
this
requirement
of
federal
law
because
just
three
years
later
in
1798,
the
state
legislature
asked
the
federal
government
to
appoint
a
commissioner
who
would
represent
the
indians
at
a
purchase
with
which
took
place
in
1798,
which
is
not
the
subject
to
this
case.
the
oneida
indians
has
sought
to
fulfill
their
obligations
under
their
agreements
with
the
new
york
and
the
federal
government.
therefore
in
1964,
they
appealed
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
for
help
who
received
none.
in
67,
we
appealed
to
the
governor
of
new
york
and
he
referred
us
to
the
constitutional
convention.
in
67,
we
appealed
of
the
constitutional
convention
and
at
that
time
the
attorney
general
appeared
and
said
this
is
a
legislative
matter.
in
68,
we
appealed
of
the
president
of
united
states
as
required
by
our
treaty
and
we
also
appealed
to
congress
in
all
cases.
we
were
denied
any
relief
at
all,
and
therefore
at
long
last,
the
oneidas
brought
this
case
which
i
consider
to
be
an
equitable-type
action.
we’re
reciting
the
treaties,
we’re
reciting
the
law,
we’re
reciting
what
happened,
and
we’re
asking
that
the
federal
courts
take
jurisdiction
and
arrive
at
some
kind
of
an
equitable
solution,
an
answer
to
the
pleas
of
justice
of
the
oneida
indians.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
well,
it’s
--
as
i
see
it
no,
your
honor.
the
oneida
indians
were
the
only
one
of
the
iroquois
tribes
who
helped
the
united
states
during
a
revolutionary
war
and
then,
in
since
they
have
pursued
a
policy
of
friendship.
they
do
not
wish
to
dispossess
anybody
who
is
now
an
occupancy
of
their
land,
that’s
why
this
is
a
suit
against
counties
who
are
occupying
the
land.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
some
kind
of
equitable
accounting
for
that
fair
rental
value
perhaps
of
the
land
as
of
today.
they
do
not
seek
to
eject
either
the
counties
or
anybody
else.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
well,
i
think
it
is
implicit
somehow.
there
is
a
precedent
for
this
kind
of
an
action.
the
whole
city
of
--
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
of
title?
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes,
i
would
say
so,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
that
is
what
we
are
trying
to
achieve.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
we
are
not
allowed
to
be
in
state
court.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
it
could
be,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
no.
i
might
point
out
that
in
the
court
below,
the
second
circuit.
the
sole
reason
it
seem
to
me
for
denying
jurisdiction
was
it
we’re
all
(voice
overlap)
your
honor?
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
no.
they
refuse
to
take
part
in
our
case
because
of
an
alleged
conflict
interest
herein.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
for
the
value
of
what
happened
in
1795,
without
any
interest,
without
any
adjustment
for
the
purchasing
power
of
the
dollar
since
then
without
any
adjustment
for
the
fair
market
value.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
it
concerns
the
same
property.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
that’s
the
indian
claim’s
case.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
we
can
get
some
part
of
it
but
they
can’t
get
the
full
relief
to
which
they
are
entitled.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
they
do.
they
could
deal
--
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
they
could
give
the
difference
between
the
fair
market
value
of
the
land
at
that
time.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
and
what
was
actually
paid
for
at
that
time
without
any
adjustment
for
interest
and
with
an
offset
for
all
services
which
had
been
given
to
the
indians
from
that
day
down
to
this
day.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes.
but
i
might
point
out
--
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
congress
when
it
enacted
the
indian
claims
commission
act
showed
no
intention
of
abrogating
treaties
with
which
the
united
states
made
agreements
with
the
indians,
and
so
i
think
this
is
the
basis.
we
could
still
recover
there
and
still
have
a
very
just
lawsuit
because
the
remedy
there
is
inadequate.
it
goes
back
so
far
what
about
175
years
of
interest.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
i
don’t
believe
it
could.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
no.
they
could
not
for
instance
dictate
what
the
state’s
liabilities
or
what
the
counties
like
--
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
pardon?
that’s
where
the
conflict
rose?
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
that’s
where
the
conflict
of
interest
rose.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
no,
your
honor.
the
indian
claims
case
--
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
or
1331.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes,
your
honor.
the
indians
claims
case
is
something
that
i
think
with
other
defenses
would
properly
be
raised
and
trial
the
case.
i
do
not
think
it’s
before
this
court.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
i
do
not
believe
in
that,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
okay.
i
think
what
we’re
into,
is
the
way
i
see
the
case
there
is
three
treaties
that
promise
oneida’s
possession
of
the
land
and
federal
law
promises
them
possession.
in
a
strictly
jurisdictional
issue,
the
second
circuit
has
held
that
non-possession
is
what
keeps
us
out
of
court.
so
that
which
the
treaties
and
promises
of
the
united
states
guarantee
possession
is
what
keeps
us
from
getting
equity
or
some
kind
of
relief.
it
seems
to
be
a
very
contradictory
situation.
i
think
that
where
--
certainly
the
rule
on
the
ejectment
cases
that
came
up
in
a
number
of
cases
is
a
good
one.
the
federal
court
should
not
and
certainly
in
the
past
that
have
heard
every
case
from
which
or
the
title
was
derived
from
the
federal
government
and
that
is
where
this
kind
of
case
came
up
that
the
second
circuit
is
basing
its
opinion
at
them.
as
i
read
those
cases
and
there
are
certainly
many
of
them
decided
by
this
court.
in
every
case,
there
was
an
alternate
state
remedy
and
we
contend
that
both
under
the
state
law
up
to
1958
and
the
federal
law
down
to
this
day,
there
is
no
way
that
the
oneida
indians
or
any
other
indian
tribe
can
bring
an
action
in
a
court,
state
court
of
new
york
state
for
question
dealing
with
land
claims.
it
seems
pretty
clear
to
me
that
under
the
law,
the
legislation
giving
civil
jurisdiction
to
state
courts.
that
congress
in
the
questions
submitted
in
the
debates
intended
or
thought
that
a
case
involving
indian
land
claims
belonged
in
federal
court.
the
tuscarora
case
which
we
urged
the
second
circuit
involved
indians
who
were
at
least
under
the
state
law
were
not
legally
in
possession
of
the
land
because
the
condemnation
map
had
been
filed.
and
under
the
condemnation
law,
the
state
immediately
became
entitled
to
possession
where
the
courts
took
jurisdiction
there
and
went
on
in
the
tuscarora
case
with
which
i
am
sure
you
are
familiar.
the
--
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
since
fairly
recently
but
not
prior
to,
i
think
it
is
about
1950,
--
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
it
was
in
a
matter
of
federal
case
law
if
not
statutory
law
since
going
way
back
to
worcester
versus
georgia.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
well,
i
think
that
very
well
could
be
new
york
state
has
taken
the
position
until
recently
that
the
federal
government
had
no
business
in
indian
matters
of
new
york
state.
but
they
worked
out
a
way
though
to
keep
questions
like
this
room
being
raised
because
they
said
one,
an
individual
indian
cannot
sue
in
behalf
of
an
indian
tribe,
one;
and
then
two,
an
indian
tribe
is
not
a
person
who
can
sue
in
the
courts
of
new
york.
now,
this
was
the
long
standing
new
york
law
court
of
appeals
up
till
1958.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
it
was
a
matter
of
new
york
law
and
of
federal
law
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor.
especially,
since
about
1952
when
the
court
--
when
the
congress
granted
civil
jurisdiction
to
the
courts
of
new
york
over
indian
matters,
it
is
specifically
reserved
through
the
federal
courts.
jurisdiction
over
indian
land
claims
dealing
with
reservation
like
the
one
we
are
talking
about.
so
to
me,
it’s
perfectly
clear
that
both
at
least
under
prior
new
york
law
and
always
under
federal
law
whether
that
was
recognized
by
the
law
of
all
states
unite
is
another
question.
that
the
federal
government
is
granted
different
powers
to
different
states
and
we
are
talking
just
about
new
york
state.
i
think
the
question
we
have
here
because
i
said
is
two
policies,
the
policy
against
having
the
federal
courts
in
undated
with
land
cases
and
a
policy
in
the
other
hand
of
the
federal
promises.
the
promises
of
the
treaties
of
the
statutes
of
george
washington
what
have
you,
the
federal
promises
and
policy
favoring
and
giving
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
indians.
in
fact,
this
is
special
federal
statute
saying
in
a
land
case
between
an
indian
and
a
white
man,
the
burden
of
proof
is
automatically
on
the
white
man.
so
all
the
way
through
--
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
that
is
what
we
claim.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
[laughter
attempt]
right.
i
haven’t
got
that
far.
okay.
well,
in
the
legislative
history
under
1362,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
congress
intended
in
several
of
the
examples
given
in
the
legislative
history.
the
indians
would
not
have
been
in
possession
under
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule.
and
if
that
is
the
key,
then
congress
change
the
luck
a
little
bit
when
it
enacted
section
1362.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
that’s
right.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
the
heading
of
the
case
says
--
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
the
heading
of
the
case
says,
“to
abolish
the
jurisdictional
amount
and
for
other
purposes.”
and
the
only
other
purpose
i
could
think
of
is
to
set
up
a
scheme
which
would
go
a
little
bit
broader
towards
letting
the
american-indian
pursue
his
own
rights
instead
of
depending
on
the
federal
government
to
act
or
not
act.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
i
would
say
that
was
completely
accurate.
i
think
that’s
what
happened
here.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
i
do
not
know
your
honor
that
congress
had
in
mind
the
very
narrow
interpretation
of
arising
under
an
indian-type
case
that
has
been
used
by
the
second
circuit.
in
this
case,
it
was
not
use
--
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
it
was
not
used
by
the
ninth
circuit
or
second
circuit
in
the
forness
and
tuscarora
cases
which
were
cited
in
the
brief.
i
think
we
come
down
to
the
fact
of
–-
it
seems
to
me
word
of
united
states.
they
said,
“you
will
have
possession
of
your
land.”
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
some
extent
the
treaties
here,
impart
create
our
cause
of
action.
certainly,
where
the
treaties
guarantee
possession,
the
fact
of
non-possession
should
not
be
the
factor
which
vitiates
our
case.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes,
we
are
in
section
1331
cases.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
i
think
it
does.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
your
honor,
i
think
that,
you
know,
with
considering
the
policy.
the
thing
here
the
--
in
the
other
1331
cases
that
i
have
been
able
to
find,
there
was
an
alternate
remedy
in
the
state
court
and
everyone
that
i
can
find.
even
taylor
versus
anderson,
which
was
specifically
an
indian
case,
the
court
there
recognized
that
there
would
have
been
the
supreme
court
and
the
district
court
that
there
would
have
been
possible
and
action
in
the
local
courts.
in
fact,
the
district
courts
said,
you
should
not
come
here
first.
you
should
have
gone
to
the
local
courts.
and
that
is
where
i
think,
even
under
1331.
i
think
there
is
serious
question
of
distinction
here,
as
the
justice
says
there,
probably
our
main
argument
should
be
under
the
1362
where
if
you
read
the
legislative
history
it
seems
clear
that
congress
intended
a
broadening
out.
not
just
the
change
of
the
jurisdictional
limitation.
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
close
now
and
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
your
honor
i
--
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
won’t
use
my
ten
minutes
your
honor.
i
have
very
short
concluding
statement
to
make.
as
i
listen
to
my
brothers
here,
as
i
listen
to
the
questions
of
the
court
directed
to
me
yesterday
i
have
this
to
say
that
when
you
boil
this
case
all
down,
the
only
question
for
this
court
to
decide
is
whether
lack
of
possession
will
bar
the
oneida
indians
and
other
indians
throughout
the
united
states
from
federal
court.
three
treaties,
federal
statutes
and
the
specific
words
of
president
george
washington
to
the
six
nations
have
promised
possession
to
the
oneidas
and
the
other
six
nations.
the
first
president
in
1790
said
to
the
seneca’s,
“in
behalf
of
the
six
nations,
the
general
government
will
never
consent
to
your
being
defrauded
but
it
will
protect
in
all
your
just
rights.”
and
further
i
am
on
the
same
speech,
president
washington
in
a
slightly
different
context,
i
must
admit.
but
he
did
say
to
the
seneca’s
that
the
federal
courts
will
be
open
to
you
for
your
just
claims
or
words
to
that
effect.
this
speech
is
pointed
in
our
brief.
now,
all
the
oneidas
want
is
a
fair
hearing
and
to
me
under
the
very
singular
facts,
treaties,
and
laws
present
in
this
case.
a
hearing
should
be
available
to
them
even
under
the
most
restrictive
interpretation
of
section
1331
and
certainly,
under
the
broader
meaning
given
to
section
1362
in
congress
in
1966.
are
there
any
further
questions
from
the
court?
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
your
honor
i
--
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
won't
use
my
10
minutes
here
really.
i
have
a
very
short
concluding
statement
to
make.
as
i
listen
to
my
brothers
here,
and
as
i
listen
to
the
questions
that
the
court
directed
to
me
yesterday,
i
have
this
to
say
that
when
you
boil
this
case
all
down,
the
only
question
for
this
court
to
decide
is
whether
lack
of
possession
will
bar
united
indians
and
other
indians
throughout
the
united
states
from
federal
court.
three
treaties,
federal
statutes
and
specific
words
of
president
george
washington
to
the
6
nations
have
promised
possession
to
oneidas
and
the
other
six
nations.
the
first
president
in
1790
said
to
the
senecas
on
behalf
of
the
six
nations,
“the
general
government
will
never
consent
to
you
have
been
defrauded,
but
it
will
protect
you
in
all
your
just
rights.”
further
on
in
the
same
speech,
president
washington
in
a
slightly
different
context
i
must
admit
when
he
did
say
to
the
senecas
that
the
federal
courts
will
be
open
to
you
for
your
just
claims
or
words
to
that
effect.
the
speech
is
printed
in
our
brief.
now
all
the
oneidas
want
is
a
fair
hearing
and
to
me
under
the
very
singular
facts,
treaties
and
laws
present
in
this
case,
a
hearing
should
be
available
to
them
even
under
the
most
restrictive
interpretation
of
section
1331
and
certainly
under
the
broader
meaning
given
to
section
1362
in
congress
in
1966.
if
there
aren't
any
further
questions
from
court?
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
mr.
chief
justice
and
if
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
oneida
indians
of
new
york
state
and
the
oneida
indians
of
wisconsin,
in
a
suit
against
madison
on
oneida
counties
of
new
york
state.
this
is
an
equitable-type
action
concerning
the
lands
currently
being
used
by
the
defendant’s
counties
but
allegedly
owned
by
the
oneida
indians.
the
sole
issue
on
this
appeal
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
to
hear
this
type
of
case.
the
complaint
alleges
and
recites
three
treaties
and
one
statute
under
which
the
united
states
has
guaranteed
to
the
plaintiffs,
the
possession
of
the
reservation
including
the
land
which
we
are
now
talking
about.
the
complaint
further
alleges
that
in
the
year
1795,
the
state
of
new
york
acquired
the
land
in
question
illegally
in
contravention
of
the
treaties
and
in
contravention
of
the
state
law
for
the
federal
law,
excuse
me,
which
holds
that
no
purchase
of
indian
lands
without
the
consent
of
united
states
shall
be
of
any
validity
in
law
or
equity.
the
complaint
also
alleges
that
the
price
we
receive
was
unconscionable
and
inadequate.
it
alleges
that
the
value
of
the
land
was
misrepresented
to
the
indians.
it
alleges
that
at
the
time
the
sale
took
place
the
indians,
the
plaintiffs
could
not
read
or
write.
it
alleges
that
two
years
after
the
purchase
of
the
state,
the
land
was
resold
at
a
profit
of
approximately
500%,
i
might
point
out
that
this
resale
of
land
was
in
the
main
to
developers
who
resold
shortly
after
at
a
further
profit.
the
complaint
also
alleges
that
the
consent
of
the
united
states
was
neither
sought
nor
obtained
by
the
state
to
the
sale,
and
further,
that
the
state
knew
of
this
requirement
of
federal
law
because
just
three
years
later
in
1798,
the
state
legislature
asked
the
federal
government
to
appoint
a
commissioner
who
would
represent
the
indians
at
a
purchase
with
which
took
place
in
1798,
which
is
not
the
subject
to
this
case.
the
oneida
indians
has
sought
to
fulfill
their
obligations
under
their
agreements
with
the
new
york
and
the
federal
government.
therefore
in
1964,
they
appealed
to
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
new
york
for
help
who
received
none.
in
67,
we
appealed
to
the
governor
of
new
york
and
he
referred
us
to
the
constitutional
convention.
in
67,
we
appealed
of
the
constitutional
convention
and
at
that
time
the
attorney
general
appeared
and
said
this
is
a
legislative
matter.
in
68,
we
appealed
of
the
president
of
united
states
as
required
by
our
treaty
and
we
also
appealed
to
congress
in
all
cases.
we
were
denied
any
relief
at
all,
and
therefore
at
long
last,
the
oneidas
brought
this
case
which
i
consider
to
be
an
equitable-type
action.
we’re
reciting
the
treaties,
we’re
reciting
the
law,
we’re
reciting
what
happened,
and
we’re
asking
that
the
federal
courts
take
jurisdiction
and
arrive
at
some
kind
of
an
equitable
solution,
an
answer
to
the
pleas
of
justice
of
the
oneida
indians.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
well,
it’s
--
as
i
see
it
no,
your
honor.
the
oneida
indians
were
the
only
one
of
the
iroquois
tribes
who
helped
the
united
states
during
a
revolutionary
war
and
then,
in
since
they
have
pursued
a
policy
of
friendship.
they
do
not
wish
to
dispossess
anybody
who
is
now
an
occupancy
of
their
land,
that’s
why
this
is
a
suit
against
counties
who
are
occupying
the
land.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
some
kind
of
equitable
accounting
for
that
fair
rental
value
perhaps
of
the
land
as
of
today.
they
do
not
seek
to
eject
either
the
counties
or
anybody
else.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
well,
i
think
it
is
implicit
somehow.
there
is
a
precedent
for
this
kind
of
an
action.
the
whole
city
of
--
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
of
title?
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes,
i
would
say
so,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
that
is
what
we
are
trying
to
achieve.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
we
are
not
allowed
to
be
in
state
court.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
it
could
be,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
no.
i
might
point
out
that
in
the
court
below,
the
second
circuit.
the
sole
reason
it
seem
to
me
for
denying
jurisdiction
was
it
we’re
all
(voice
overlap)
your
honor?
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
no.
they
refuse
to
take
part
in
our
case
because
of
an
alleged
conflict
interest
herein.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
for
the
value
of
what
happened
in
1795,
without
any
interest,
without
any
adjustment
for
the
purchasing
power
of
the
dollar
since
then
without
any
adjustment
for
the
fair
market
value.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
it
concerns
the
same
property.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
that’s
the
indian
claim’s
case.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
we
can
get
some
part
of
it
but
they
can’t
get
the
full
relief
to
which
they
are
entitled.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
they
do.
they
could
deal
--
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
they
could
give
the
difference
between
the
fair
market
value
of
the
land
at
that
time.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
and
what
was
actually
paid
for
at
that
time
without
any
adjustment
for
interest
and
with
an
offset
for
all
services
which
had
been
given
to
the
indians
from
that
day
down
to
this
day.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes.
but
i
might
point
out
--
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
congress
when
it
enacted
the
indian
claims
commission
act
showed
no
intention
of
abrogating
treaties
with
which
the
united
states
made
agreements
with
the
indians,
and
so
i
think
this
is
the
basis.
we
could
still
recover
there
and
still
have
a
very
just
lawsuit
because
the
remedy
there
is
inadequate.
it
goes
back
so
far
what
about
175
years
of
interest.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
no,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
i
don’t
believe
it
could.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
no.
they
could
not
for
instance
dictate
what
the
state’s
liabilities
or
what
the
counties
like
--
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
pardon?
that’s
where
the
conflict
rose?
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
that’s
where
the
conflict
of
interest
rose.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
no,
your
honor.
the
indian
claims
case
--
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
that
is
the
issue.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
or
1331.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes,
your
honor.
the
indians
claims
case
is
something
that
i
think
with
other
defenses
would
properly
be
raised
and
trial
the
case.
i
do
not
think
it’s
before
this
court.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
i
do
not
believe
in
that,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
okay.
i
think
what
we’re
into,
is
the
way
i
see
the
case
there
is
three
treaties
that
promise
oneida’s
possession
of
the
land
and
federal
law
promises
them
possession.
in
a
strictly
jurisdictional
issue,
the
second
circuit
has
held
that
non-possession
is
what
keeps
us
out
of
court.
so
that
which
the
treaties
and
promises
of
the
united
states
guarantee
possession
is
what
keeps
us
from
getting
equity
or
some
kind
of
relief.
it
seems
to
be
a
very
contradictory
situation.
i
think
that
where
--
certainly
the
rule
on
the
ejectment
cases
that
came
up
in
a
number
of
cases
is
a
good
one.
the
federal
court
should
not
and
certainly
in
the
past
that
have
heard
every
case
from
which
or
the
title
was
derived
from
the
federal
government
and
that
is
where
this
kind
of
case
came
up
that
the
second
circuit
is
basing
its
opinion
at
them.
as
i
read
those
cases
and
there
are
certainly
many
of
them
decided
by
this
court.
in
every
case,
there
was
an
alternate
state
remedy
and
we
contend
that
both
under
the
state
law
up
to
1958
and
the
federal
law
down
to
this
day,
there
is
no
way
that
the
oneida
indians
or
any
other
indian
tribe
can
bring
an
action
in
a
court,
state
court
of
new
york
state
for
question
dealing
with
land
claims.
it
seems
pretty
clear
to
me
that
under
the
law,
the
legislation
giving
civil
jurisdiction
to
state
courts.
that
congress
in
the
questions
submitted
in
the
debates
intended
or
thought
that
a
case
involving
indian
land
claims
belonged
in
federal
court.
the
tuscarora
case
which
we
urged
the
second
circuit
involved
indians
who
were
at
least
under
the
state
law
were
not
legally
in
possession
of
the
land
because
the
condemnation
map
had
been
filed.
and
under
the
condemnation
law,
the
state
immediately
became
entitled
to
possession
where
the
courts
took
jurisdiction
there
and
went
on
in
the
tuscarora
case
with
which
i
am
sure
you
are
familiar.
the
--
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
since
fairly
recently
but
not
prior
to,
i
think
it
is
about
1950,
--
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
it
was
in
a
matter
of
federal
case
law
if
not
statutory
law
since
going
way
back
to
worcester
versus
georgia.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
well,
i
think
that
very
well
could
be
new
york
state
has
taken
the
position
until
recently
that
the
federal
government
had
no
business
in
indian
matters
of
new
york
state.
but
they
worked
out
a
way
though
to
keep
questions
like
this
room
being
raised
because
they
said
one,
an
individual
indian
cannot
sue
in
behalf
of
an
indian
tribe,
one;
and
then
two,
an
indian
tribe
is
not
a
person
who
can
sue
in
the
courts
of
new
york.
now,
this
was
the
long
standing
new
york
law
court
of
appeals
up
till
1958.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
it
was
a
matter
of
new
york
law
and
of
federal
law
as
i
understand
it,
your
honor.
especially,
since
about
1952
when
the
court
--
when
the
congress
granted
civil
jurisdiction
to
the
courts
of
new
york
over
indian
matters,
it
is
specifically
reserved
through
the
federal
courts.
jurisdiction
over
indian
land
claims
dealing
with
reservation
like
the
one
we
are
talking
about.
so
to
me,
it’s
perfectly
clear
that
both
at
least
under
prior
new
york
law
and
always
under
federal
law
whether
that
was
recognized
by
the
law
of
all
states
unite
is
another
question.
that
the
federal
government
is
granted
different
powers
to
different
states
and
we
are
talking
just
about
new
york
state.
i
think
the
question
we
have
here
because
i
said
is
two
policies,
the
policy
against
having
the
federal
courts
in
undated
with
land
cases
and
a
policy
in
the
other
hand
of
the
federal
promises.
the
promises
of
the
treaties
of
the
statutes
of
george
washington
what
have
you,
the
federal
promises
and
policy
favoring
and
giving
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
to
indians.
in
fact,
this
is
special
federal
statute
saying
in
a
land
case
between
an
indian
and
a
white
man,
the
burden
of
proof
is
automatically
on
the
white
man.
so
all
the
way
through
--
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
that
is
what
we
claim.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
[laughter
attempt]
right.
i
haven’t
got
that
far.
okay.
well,
in
the
legislative
history
under
1362,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
congress
intended
in
several
of
the
examples
given
in
the
legislative
history.
the
indians
would
not
have
been
in
possession
under
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule.
and
if
that
is
the
key,
then
congress
change
the
luck
a
little
bit
when
it
enacted
section
1362.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
that’s
right.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
the
heading
of
the
case
says
--
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
the
heading
of
the
case
says,
“to
abolish
the
jurisdictional
amount
and
for
other
purposes.”
and
the
only
other
purpose
i
could
think
of
is
to
set
up
a
scheme
which
would
go
a
little
bit
broader
towards
letting
the
american-indian
pursue
his
own
rights
instead
of
depending
on
the
federal
government
to
act
or
not
act.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
i
would
say
that
was
completely
accurate.
i
think
that’s
what
happened
here.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
i
do
not
know
your
honor
that
congress
had
in
mind
the
very
narrow
interpretation
of
arising
under
an
indian-type
case
that
has
been
used
by
the
second
circuit.
in
this
case,
it
was
not
use
--
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
it
was
not
used
by
the
ninth
circuit
or
second
circuit
in
the
forness
and
tuscarora
cases
which
were
cited
in
the
brief.
i
think
we
come
down
to
the
fact
of
–-
it
seems
to
me
word
of
united
states.
they
said,
“you
will
have
possession
of
your
land.”
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
some
extent
the
treaties
here,
impart
create
our
cause
of
action.
certainly,
where
the
treaties
guarantee
possession,
the
fact
of
non-possession
should
not
be
the
factor
which
vitiates
our
case.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
yes,
we
are
in
section
1331
cases.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
i
think
it
does.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
your
honor,
i
think
that,
you
know,
with
considering
the
policy.
the
thing
here
the
--
in
the
other
1331
cases
that
i
have
been
able
to
find,
there
was
an
alternate
remedy
in
the
state
court
and
everyone
that
i
can
find.
even
taylor
versus
anderson,
which
was
specifically
an
indian
case,
the
court
there
recognized
that
there
would
have
been
the
supreme
court
and
the
district
court
that
there
would
have
been
possible
and
action
in
the
local
courts.
in
fact,
the
district
courts
said,
you
should
not
come
here
first.
you
should
have
gone
to
the
local
courts.
and
that
is
where
i
think,
even
under
1331.
i
think
there
is
serious
question
of
distinction
here,
as
the
justice
says
there,
probably
our
main
argument
should
be
under
the
1362
where
if
you
read
the
legislative
history
it
seems
clear
that
congress
intended
a
broadening
out.
not
just
the
change
of
the
jurisdictional
limitation.
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
close
now
and
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
george
c.
shattuck
your
honor
i
--
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
won’t
use
my
ten
minutes
your
honor.
i
have
very
short
concluding
statement
to
make.
as
i
listen
to
my
brothers
here,
as
i
listen
to
the
questions
of
the
court
directed
to
me
yesterday
i
have
this
to
say
that
when
you
boil
this
case
all
down,
the
only
question
for
this
court
to
decide
is
whether
lack
of
possession
will
bar
the
oneida
indians
and
other
indians
throughout
the
united
states
from
federal
court.
three
treaties,
federal
statutes
and
the
specific
words
of
president
george
washington
to
the
six
nations
have
promised
possession
to
the
oneidas
and
the
other
six
nations.
the
first
president
in
1790
said
to
the
seneca’s,
“in
behalf
of
the
six
nations,
the
general
government
will
never
consent
to
your
being
defrauded
but
it
will
protect
in
all
your
just
rights.”
and
further
i
am
on
the
same
speech,
president
washington
in
a
slightly
different
context,
i
must
admit.
but
he
did
say
to
the
seneca’s
that
the
federal
courts
will
be
open
to
you
for
your
just
claims
or
words
to
that
effect.
this
speech
is
pointed
in
our
brief.
now,
all
the
oneidas
want
is
a
fair
hearing
and
to
me
under
the
very
singular
facts,
treaties,
and
laws
present
in
this
case.
a
hearing
should
be
available
to
them
even
under
the
most
restrictive
interpretation
of
section
1331
and
certainly,
under
the
broader
meaning
given
to
section
1362
in
congress
in
1966.
are
there
any
further
questions
from
the
court?
mr.
george
c.
shattuck

you
your
honor.

won't

10
