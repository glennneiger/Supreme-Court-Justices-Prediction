(inaudible)
and
this
person
who
is
a
member
of
recognized
tribe
and
one-quarter
indian-blood
in
an
ordinary
job,
he
has
the
protection
of
oeo?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
he
had
both.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
do
with
veteran’s
preference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
haven’t
you
heard
that
--
haven’t
you
heard
that
they
exist?
justice
thurgood
marshall
[voice
overlap]
equally
qualified
people
and
the
veteran
automatically
gets
the
preference.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
talking
about
those
that
are
applying
for
the
job?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
that.
but
i
thought
you
were
talking
originally
about
--my
brother
white
asked
you
about
somebody
applying
for
a
job.
that’s
what
i
am
aware
of.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
believe
that
the
bia
could
say
as
a
matter
of
policy
there
is
no
civil
service
required?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
we
got
--
in
the
bia
we
got
a
$100,000.00
and
these
are
small
figures
because
i
cannot
understand
big
ones
[laughter]
for
water
and
health
facilities
and
$100,000.00
dollars
for
employment.
so
far,
the
government
is
concerned,
they’re
just
two
$100,000.00.
you
say
they
expend
that
$100,000.00
to
the
exclusion
of
everybody
but
indian.
one
for
the
water
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
the
bia
says
we
are
going
to
put
a
$100,000.00
into
a
water
purification
plant
on
the
jacob's
reservation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
none
of
that
water
can
anybody
else
than
the
indian
touch
and
that's
solely
for
indians,
that’s
okay?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
if
the
bia
said
we
are
pouring
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
for
employment
of
indians
only,
that
is
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
it
is
still
a
hundred
thousand
dollars.
justice
thurgood
marshall
[voice
overlap]
about
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
is
all
we
are
talking
about
the
whole
case
is?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
knew
it
when
they
took
the
job?
justice
thurgood
marshall
when
was
this
preference
act
passed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
aren’t
so
many
of
these
employees
hired
since
1934?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
franchini,
you
said
there
is
a
great
difference
between
when
the
preference
act
was
passed
and
the
present
time.
is
there
any
of
these
records
backing
up
on
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
was
the
percentage
when
it
was
passed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
go
ahead,
but
i
am
not
interested
in
that.
you
say
it
is
such
a
--
the
indians
are
somewhat
better
off
now.
i
thought
that’s
what
you
are
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
sure!
so
are
you!
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
hope.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
any
movement
to
repeal
the
preference
act
or
you
want
us
to
repeal
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
you
said
you
wanted
us
to
rule
it
unconstitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
came
by
one
word
in
that
act
that
suggests
it,right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there’s
not
one
word
in
the
act
that
suggests
the
repealing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
only
word
you
have
is
the
word
of
senator
bird
where
he
said,
“all
others”
and
you
say
that
includes
indians.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
repeal
acts
that
way.
you
do
not
throw
them
all
and
say
(inaudible)
repeal
the
whole
and
mess
them
at
the
same
time.
you
are
really
serious
that
this
repealed
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
can
read
the
opinion
and
i
can
disagree
with
it,
can
i?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
depends
on
what
they
said
in
their
opinion
and
they
just
said
automatically
it
was
repealed
which
is
just
what
you
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
mr.
morton,
is
he
the
one
that
is
petitioner
in
this
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
is
one
of
the
appellants?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
as
i
understood
you
just
say
he
agreed
with
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
he
be
an
appellant
and
be
all
your
side
too?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well
now,
wait
a
minute.
now,
a
minute
ago
i
think
the
other
side
admitted
that
for
once,
the
united
states
government
was
in
agreement
on
the
case
and
now
you
say
they
are
not
even
in
agreement
on
this
one.
justice
thurgood

they
are
in
agreement
with
you?
