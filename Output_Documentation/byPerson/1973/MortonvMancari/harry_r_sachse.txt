mr.
harry
r.
sachse
mr.
acting
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
decision
of
a
three-judge
district
court
or
the
district
of
new
mexico,
enjoining
the
secretary
of
the
interior
from
enforcing
the
employment
preference
for
indians
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
required
by
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934.
the
appellees
and
other
preference
acts,
the
appellees
are
non-indian
employees
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
acting
individually
and
as
a
bringing
class
action,
who’ve
been
--
who
claimed
to
have
been
denied
promotion,
because
of
the
preference.
they
argue
that
the
preference
laws
are
unconstitutional
under
the
fifth
amendment
that
they’ve
been
tacitly,
i
suppose,
repealed
by
the
equal
employment
opportunities
act
of
1972
and
that
in
any
event
they’re
being
interpreted
too
broadly
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
the
court
held
that
the
acts
had
been
repealed
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
act
of
1972.
the
court
said
that
it
could
hold
that
the
acts
were
also
unconstitutional,
but
it
did
not
so
hold
and
because
of
its
holdings
on
these
points,
it
didn’t
have
to
reach
the
issue
of
the
breadth
of
the
application
of
the
acts.
the
intervenor
in
this
case
is
amerind,
an
association
of
indian
employees
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
who
have
the
preference
that’s
under
attack
here.
this
case
concerns
the
exercise
by
the
federal
government,
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
of
its
trust
responsibility
to
tribal
indians
and
its
effort
to
provide
them
an
opportunity
for
self-determination
and
self-help.
i
think
that
i
can
show
to
you
that
it’s
not
a
racial
discrimination
involved
in
this
case
at
all,
but
a
determination
to
have
the
people
whose
property
and
lives
are
affected
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
have
common
role
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
since
we’re
talking
about
a
preference
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
i
think
it’s
important
for
both
issues
of
the
case
to
give
some
facts
about
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
because
i
think
it’s
not
well
understood.
there
are
only
some
300
employees
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
in
washington.
there
some
2000
others
in
offices,
in
indian
areas
of
the
country,
in
denver,
albuquerque,
billings,
montana,
phoenix,
muskogee,
oklahoma,
and
other
places.
these
are
the
administrator--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes,
about
to
get
to
that.
that
takes
--
this
is
some
2,300
that
i
have
spoken
of,
then
there
are
11,500
employees
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
who
actually
work
on
the
reservations
and
these
are
not
people
in
some
sort
of
high
administrative
jobs.
these
are
policemen
on
the
reservations,
the
foresters
who
attend
the
indian
forest,
irrigation
workers,
engineers,
teachers,
a
good
number
of
them
are
teachers,
bus
drivers,
social
workers,
employment
assistance
personnel,
house
builders,
there’s
a
housing
program
going
on,
and
then
there
are
a
lot
of
employees
who
are
in
a
kind
of
work
program
as
a
substitute
for
welfare
program,
where
simply
things
that
need
to
be
done
or
done
through
hiring
the
people
who
live
there
to
do
it.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes,
in
the
record,
the
total
number
of
indian
employees
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
is
57%,
i
believe
it
is,
which
has
arise
from
some
40
somewhat
percent,
20
to
30
years
ago.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
oh,
in
the
nation?
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
there
about
600,000
indians
under
direct
regulation
or
supervision,
or
assistance
from
bureau
of
indian
affairs
and
there
may
be
another
400,000
who
would
say
that
they’re
indians,
but
who
are
not
affected
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
[voice
overlap]
those
are
rough
figures,
about
600,000.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
they’re
about
a
million
people
who
answered
the
last
census
and
said
that
they
were
indians.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
but
there
was
no
precise
definition
for
that
because
600,000
who
are
members
of
federally
recognized
tribes,
who
either
lived
on
reservations
or
off
reservations,
but
have
property
that
is
being
managed
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that’s
correct
and
it’s
not
just
as
i
see
it.
the
chief
personnel
office
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
testified
in
the
trial
of
this
case,
he
testified
that
the
preference
limited
to
indians
who
are
members
of
federally
recognized
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that’s
right,
but
it’s
not
contested
this
time
that,
that
is
the
way
they
are
administering
it.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
and,
we
can
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
the
statute
is
capable
of
a
broader
interpretation.
we
think
this
is
the
correct
interpretation
of
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that’s
correct,
that’s
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
am
not
sure
which
sentence
was,
and
the
last
word
was
probably
tribe,
what
was
the
sentence?[laughter]
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
our
position
is
that
an
indian
does
not
have
preference,
unless
he
is
member
of
a
federally
recognized
indian
tribe
and
also,
is
of
at
least
one-fourth
indian
blood.
now
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes,
it
does.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
do
and
i’d
like
to
say
this
though,
that
i
would
like
to
spend
most
of
my
time,
if
i
can
on
the
statement
of
the
case
and
the
constitutional
issues
here.
and
mr.
sherman
is
prepared
to
deal
in
detailed
with
the
equal
opportunity
act
of
1972,
but
rather
than
leave
this
hanging,
the
act
describes
in
some
detail
the
outer
limits
of
section
717
of
the
act,
which
is
what
is
at
issue
here,
described
in
some
detail
the
outer
limits
of
the
civil
service
commission’s
authority
and
it
lists
this
agency,
but
not
that
agency
to
trace
that.
for
instance,
there’s
a
problem
with
the
general
accounting
of,
there
is
no
question
that
the
act
intends
to
have
it
brought
out
or
scope,
cover
everything
in
civil
service,
but
there
is
a
specific
exception
to
the
civil
service
law,
which
i’ll
explain
for
this
indian
preference,
back
to
indian
preference
statute
itself
says
this
shall
be
so
without
regard
to
the
civil
service
law
and
was
done
quite
deliberately
that
way,
it
has
been
handled
that
way.
now,
i
want
to
go
back
for
a
minute
and
talk
about
the
reason
for
the
indian
preference
statute.
when
sort
of
romantic
period
of
indian
law
is
the
period
before
1880,
but
by
the
1880s,
the
indian
wars
were
about
over,
the
indians
had
been
confined
to
reservations.
they
had
been
put
on
reservations,
generally
that
didn’t
give
them
enough
water
or
land
or
resources
to
provide
for
their
livelihood.
so
they
came
in
fact,
as
well
as
in
legal
theory,
the
wards
of
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
didn’t
feed
them
in
those
days,
they
didn’t
eat.
there
simply
wasn’t
enough
to
go
around
and
there
was
an
increasing
period
of
federal
responsibility
for
the
indian
tribes,
though
the
indians
had
been
promised
in
every
treaty
that
they
would
have
a
certain
level
of
independence
and
that
though
we
can't
say
the
day
that
their
sovereign
nations,
some
concept
of
sovereignty
is
behind
that
as
mr.
justice
marshall
said
in
the
mcclanahan
case.
what
happened
under
this
period
of
federal
supervision
and
care
was
devastating
to
the
indian
tribes.
and
by
1934,
it
had
become
one
of
the
greater
national
scandals.
in
the
1930s,
after
50
years
of
guardianship,
both
the
administration
and
congress
decided
that
there
had
to
be
some
completely
new
system
for
handling
indian
affairs.
commissioner
of
indian
affairs,
collier
is
testifying
congress
in
1934,
pointed
out
that
during
the
years,
between
1880s
and
1934,
during
the
years,
when
the
federal
government
had
the
most
responsibility,
wars
were
over,
that
the
indians
had
been,
and
these
are
his
words
drifting
towards
complete
impoverishment.
that
they
had
been
disorganized
as
groups,
deliberately
disorganized
by
the
federal
government
as
groups
and
pushed
to
lower
social
status
as
individuals.
and
that
their
land
holdings
had
diminished
and
this
is
after
they’d
given
up
most
of
the
country.
this
is
--
their
landholdings
had
diminished
from
138
million
acres
in
1887
to
48
million
acres
in
1934
and
something
had
to
be
done.
the
purpose
of
the
indian
reorganization
act
was
to
reverse
that
trend
towards
destruction
and
not
to
strong
award,
by
ending
the
indian
allotment
policy,
which
had
led
land
go
first
indian
hands
and
then,
out
of
indian
hands.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
i
think
it
was
the
latter.
this
was
lands
that
had
passed
out
of
any
kind
of
[voice
overlap]
indian
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
reform.
i
know
it’s
not
just
tribal
holding
[voice
overlap].
no,
what
he
was
referring
to
is
the
amount
of
land
that
had
been
lost
after
allotment,
where
the
land
was
allotted
and
then,
everything
that
wasn’t
allotted
was
considered
surplus
land,
and
then
it
was
just
openly
sold
off
to
non-indians,
who
created
this.
anyway,
to
end
this
abuse,
was
to
terminate
the
allotment
act
to
encourage
indian
governments
on
the
reservation
and
there
was
a
third
part,
and
that
was
to
make
the
indian
role
a
prominent
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
there
was
an
attempt
at
the
classic
problem
of
who
guards
the
guardian
and
the
federal
government
had
failed
as
a
plain
guardian,
and
it
was
felt
necessary
to
have
the
indians
participate
strongly
in
guarding
the
guardians
and
self-help,
doing
their
own
work.
a
more
radical
proposal
was
discarded,
more
radical
proposal
was
to
give
the
tribes
an
absolute
veto
or
virtually
an
absolute
veto
of
any
bureau
of
indian
affairs
person,
who
would
be
sent
to
reservation.
but
rather
than
do
that,
congress
decided
on
this
proposal
of
giving
the
preference
to
indians
and
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
i
have
some
nice
examples
of
language
from
the
congressional
record
pointing
out
the
purpose
for
this,
but
i
don’t
think
i’ll
read
them
to
you.
we
have
it
on
our
brief.
as
one
of
the
pithier
and
shorter
ones
is
by
senator
norbeck,
who
simply
said,
“i
think
we’ve
utterly
fallen
down
in
the
present
system.
the
indian
has
been
excluded.
the
reservation
has
built
up
with
white
people,
who
live
of
the
indians.”
and
other
statements
attribute
this
directly
to
the
workings
of
the
civil
service
law
and
mr.
collier
pointed
out
there
are
actually
less
indians
working
for
indian
progress
in
1934
than
in
1930
--
excuse
me,
than
in
1900.
less
percentage
of
indians
because
the
civil
service
law
had
served
to
weed
out
qualified
indians,
who
may
not
had
been
able
to
compete
with
hundreds
of
non-indian
applicants
and
there
were
many
statements
that
the
indians
should
not
have
to
compete
with
non-indians
for
the
jobs
in
their
own
service,
and
in
controlling
their
own
property.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
it
does
in
this
sense.
it
has
responsibility
for
the
--
it
has
trust
responsibility
for
all
trust
property.
some
of
the
trust
property
is
allotted,
trust
property.
so,
in
that
sense,
you
might
say
it’s
outside
of
tribal
affairs,
but
other
than
members
of
tribes
with
allotted
property,
it
only
has
jurisdiction.
its
view
is
that
it
only
has
jurisdiction
where
it’s
dealing
with
tribal
indians.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that’s
correct,
that’s
correct.
i
want
to
point
out
also
that
this
is
not
--
well,
before
i
get
to
this,
the
act
itself,
of
course
says
specifically
that
the
preferences
to
be
without
regard
to
civil
service
laws
to
be
the
confident
indians
without
regard
to
civil
service
laws.
and
it’s
a
preference
in
the
administration
of
functions
or
services
affecting
any
indian
tribe
and
that’s
the
way
it’s
been
handled
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
i
want
to
point
also
that
there
many
indians,
many
people
who
racially
could
be
considered
an
indian,
who
don’t
get
this
preference.
for
instance,
if
someone
is
a
member
of
a
terminated
tribe,
such
as
the
clackamas
of
oregon,
their
property
is
no
longer
being
administered
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
they
don’t
get
the
preference.
somebody
is
a
member
of
a
tribe
whose
property
has
never
been
handled
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
such
passamaquoddy
in
maine,
they
don’t
get
the
preference.
if
someone
is
racially
a
pure-blooded
indian
from
canada,
from
mexico,
though
he
lived
here
three
generations,
he
doesn’t
get
the
preference.
the
preference
is
not
a
racial
preference.
it’s
a
preference
for
the
people,
whose
property
and
lives
are
affected
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
who
serve
in
that
bureau.
that’s
undisputed
in
the
record
of
this
case
testimony
to
that
effect.
now,
we
think
it’s
clear
that
the
statute
was
not
repealed
by
the
equal
employment
act
of
1972.
as
we
demonstrate
in
our
brief,
and
i
point
out
also
this
letter
from
civil
service
commission
that
makes
this
point
that’s
in
the
record
of
the
case,
civil
service
commission,
which
has
primary
responsibility
for
enforcing
equal
employment
act
of
1972
in
government
service
fully
agrees
with
this,
that
there's
not
a
word
in
the
act,
they
also
had
a
role
in
drafting,
there's
not
a
word
in
the
act
that
sets
out
to
abolish
this
indian
preference.
certainly,
the
broad
language
about
racial
preference
or
national
origin
doesn’t
do
it
itself.
the
legislative
history
shows
not
any
intention
to
change
the
indian
preference
and
it’s
in
conceivable
to
us
that
congress
in
act
setting
out
to
increase
minority
participation
in
government
would
have
abolished
the
indian
preference
without
a
word,
saying
that
they’re
doing
it.
i
think
if
they’d
intended
to
do
that,
they
would
have
done
it.
they
had
the
right
to
rely
on
the
principles
of
statutory
construction
that
this
broad
act
would
not
repeal
the
more
specific
act.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
unless,
you
focus
on
the
purpose
for
those
exceptions,
which
are
not
really
exceptions
at
all,
but
simply
a
delimitation
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
and
at
the
outer
limits
of
the
civil
service
commission
authority.
but
i’d
like
to
stay
out
of
that,
so
that
mr.
sherman
can
get
into
that.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
am
afraid
i
did,
and
i
know
you
are
unhappy
with
me
for
saying
it
all.
[laughter]
but
i
promise
not
to
do
too
much
of
that,
but
i
want
you
to
know
that
this
is
also
the
position
of
the
united
states.
now,
to
the
constitutional
issue
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
for
a
change.
[laughter]
in
board
of
commissioners
versus
seber
upholding
an
indian
tax
immunity
against
the
constitutional
attack
on
equal
protection
grounds,
the
court
said
this,
and
i
think
the
key
to
this
case
too.
it
said
in
the
exercise
of
the
war
and
treaty
powers,
the
united
states
overcame
the
indians
and
took
possession
of
their
lands,
sometimes
by
force,
leaving
them
uneducated,
helpless,
and
dependent
people,
needing
protection
against
the
selfishness
of
others
and
their
own
of
improvidence.
of
necessity,
the
united
states
assumed
the
duty
of
furnishing
that
protection
and
with
it,
the
authority
to
do
all
that
was
required
to
perform
that
obligation
and
to
prepare
the
indians
to
take
their
places
independent,
qualified
members
of
the
modern
body
politics.
then,
actually
in
an
earlier
case,
perrin
versus
the
united
states,
in
upholding
the
laws
as
to
sale
of
liquor
to
indians
on
land
next
to
reservation,
the
court
said
that
in
determining
what
is
reasonably
essential
to
the
protection
of
the
indians,
congress
is
invested
with
wide
discretion
in
its
actions,
unless
purely
arbitrary
must
be
accepted
in
given
full
effect
by
the
courts.
now,
this
--
i
do
not
know
that
i
would
argue
for
that
broader
standard,
but
certainly
that
kind
of
standard
is
the
test
for
this
case
that
this
an
area
that
congress
has
to
deal
with.
it’s
a
difficult
area.
congress
has
dealt
with
and
in
good
faith,
and
to
great
extent
successfully
with
the
1934
reorganization
act
and
the
court
should
be
loath
to
undo
that
on
constitutional
grounds.
now
one
of
the
point
and
that
is
the
way
we
analyze
this
case,
this
is
not
really
an
equal
protection
case,
at
all
because
equal
protection
refers
to
people,
who
are
essentially
in
the
same
relationship
to
the
government,
but
the
government
then
has
passed
laws
to
treat
them
in
different
ways
and
then,
the
court
uses
its
equal
protection
analysis
to
decide
whether
the
difference
in
that
treatment
is
justifiable.
but
here,
there's
an
essential
different
relationship,
between
a
tribal
indian,
whose
tribal
property
is
being
managed
by
bia
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
i
put
this
the
other
way,
that
i
think
[voice
overlap]
this
is--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
i
have
an
easier
case
from
that,
because
the
special
treatment
in
the
constitution
itself
of
indians,
the
indian
--
the
commerce
clause
and
the
long
history
of
special
legislation
in
dealing
in
indian
affairs
and
i
point
out
in
light
of
recent
decisions
of
court
in
arnett
ii
that
perhaps
a
non-indian
employee
doesn’t
have
a
vested
right
and
there’s
a
job
in
the
bia
or
if
he
does,
it’s
under
the
terms
that
comes
in
under.
but,
i
say
that
only
to
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist.[laughter]
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
may
have
about
30
seconds.
i
obviously
cannot
answer
all
of
these
things.
i
ask
the
court
not
to
get
into
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
preference
too
much.
that
is
in
litigation
elsewhere.
it
was
not
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
mr.
acting
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
decision
of
a
three-judge
district
court
or
the
district
of
new
mexico,
enjoining
the
secretary
of
the
interior
from
enforcing
the
employment
preference
for
indians
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
required
by
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934.
the
appellees
and
other
preference
acts,
the
appellees
are
non-indian
employees
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
acting
individually
and
as
a
bringing
class
action,
who’ve
been
--
who
claimed
to
have
been
denied
promotion,
because
of
the
preference.
they
argue
that
the
preference
laws
are
unconstitutional
under
the
fifth
amendment
that
they’ve
been
tacitly,
i
suppose,
repealed
by
the
equal
employment
opportunities
act
of
1972
and
that
in
any
event
they’re
being
interpreted
too
broadly
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior.
the
court
held
that
the
acts
had
been
repealed
by
the
equal
employment
opportunity
act
of
1972.
the
court
said
that
it
could
hold
that
the
acts
were
also
unconstitutional,
but
it
did
not
so
hold
and
because
of
its
holdings
on
these
points,
it
didn’t
have
to
reach
the
issue
of
the
breadth
of
the
application
of
the
acts.
the
intervenor
in
this
case
is
amerind,
an
association
of
indian
employees
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
who
have
the
preference
that’s
under
attack
here.
this
case
concerns
the
exercise
by
the
federal
government,
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
of
its
trust
responsibility
to
tribal
indians
and
its
effort
to
provide
them
an
opportunity
for
self-determination
and
self-help.
i
think
that
i
can
show
to
you
that
it’s
not
a
racial
discrimination
involved
in
this
case
at
all,
but
a
determination
to
have
the
people
whose
property
and
lives
are
affected
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
have
common
role
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
since
we’re
talking
about
a
preference
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
i
think
it’s
important
for
both
issues
of
the
case
to
give
some
facts
about
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
because
i
think
it’s
not
well
understood.
there
are
only
some
300
employees
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
in
washington.
there
some
2000
others
in
offices,
in
indian
areas
of
the
country,
in
denver,
albuquerque,
billings,
montana,
phoenix,
muskogee,
oklahoma,
and
other
places.
these
are
the
administrator--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes,
about
to
get
to
that.
that
takes
--
this
is
some
2,300
that
i
have
spoken
of,
then
there
are
11,500
employees
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
who
actually
work
on
the
reservations
and
these
are
not
people
in
some
sort
of
high
administrative
jobs.
these
are
policemen
on
the
reservations,
the
foresters
who
attend
the
indian
forest,
irrigation
workers,
engineers,
teachers,
a
good
number
of
them
are
teachers,
bus
drivers,
social
workers,
employment
assistance
personnel,
house
builders,
there’s
a
housing
program
going
on,
and
then
there
are
a
lot
of
employees
who
are
in
a
kind
of
work
program
as
a
substitute
for
welfare
program,
where
simply
things
that
need
to
be
done
or
done
through
hiring
the
people
who
live
there
to
do
it.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes,
in
the
record,
the
total
number
of
indian
employees
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
is
57%,
i
believe
it
is,
which
has
arise
from
some
40
somewhat
percent,
20
to
30
years
ago.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
oh,
in
the
nation?
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
there
about
600,000
indians
under
direct
regulation
or
supervision,
or
assistance
from
bureau
of
indian
affairs
and
there
may
be
another
400,000
who
would
say
that
they’re
indians,
but
who
are
not
affected
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
[voice
overlap]
those
are
rough
figures,
about
600,000.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
they’re
about
a
million
people
who
answered
the
last
census
and
said
that
they
were
indians.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
but
there
was
no
precise
definition
for
that
because
600,000
who
are
members
of
federally
recognized
tribes,
who
either
lived
on
reservations
or
off
reservations,
but
have
property
that
is
being
managed
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that’s
correct
and
it’s
not
just
as
i
see
it.
the
chief
personnel
office
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
testified
in
the
trial
of
this
case,
he
testified
that
the
preference
limited
to
indians
who
are
members
of
federally
recognized
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that’s
right,
but
it’s
not
contested
this
time
that,
that
is
the
way
they
are
administering
it.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
and,
we
can
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
the
statute
is
capable
of
a
broader
interpretation.
we
think
this
is
the
correct
interpretation
of
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that’s
correct,
that’s
correct.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
am
not
sure
which
sentence
was,
and
the
last
word
was
probably
tribe,
what
was
the
sentence?[laughter]
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
our
position
is
that
an
indian
does
not
have
preference,
unless
he
is
member
of
a
federally
recognized
indian
tribe
and
also,
is
of
at
least
one-fourth
indian
blood.
now
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
yes,
it
does.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
do
and
i’d
like
to
say
this
though,
that
i
would
like
to
spend
most
of
my
time,
if
i
can
on
the
statement
of
the
case
and
the
constitutional
issues
here.
and
mr.
sherman
is
prepared
to
deal
in
detailed
with
the
equal
opportunity
act
of
1972,
but
rather
than
leave
this
hanging,
the
act
describes
in
some
detail
the
outer
limits
of
section
717
of
the
act,
which
is
what
is
at
issue
here,
described
in
some
detail
the
outer
limits
of
the
civil
service
commission’s
authority
and
it
lists
this
agency,
but
not
that
agency
to
trace
that.
for
instance,
there’s
a
problem
with
the
general
accounting
of,
there
is
no
question
that
the
act
intends
to
have
it
brought
out
or
scope,
cover
everything
in
civil
service,
but
there
is
a
specific
exception
to
the
civil
service
law,
which
i’ll
explain
for
this
indian
preference,
back
to
indian
preference
statute
itself
says
this
shall
be
so
without
regard
to
the
civil
service
law
and
was
done
quite
deliberately
that
way,
it
has
been
handled
that
way.
now,
i
want
to
go
back
for
a
minute
and
talk
about
the
reason
for
the
indian
preference
statute.
when
sort
of
romantic
period
of
indian
law
is
the
period
before
1880,
but
by
the
1880s,
the
indian
wars
were
about
over,
the
indians
had
been
confined
to
reservations.
they
had
been
put
on
reservations,
generally
that
didn’t
give
them
enough
water
or
land
or
resources
to
provide
for
their
livelihood.
so
they
came
in
fact,
as
well
as
in
legal
theory,
the
wards
of
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
didn’t
feed
them
in
those
days,
they
didn’t
eat.
there
simply
wasn’t
enough
to
go
around
and
there
was
an
increasing
period
of
federal
responsibility
for
the
indian
tribes,
though
the
indians
had
been
promised
in
every
treaty
that
they
would
have
a
certain
level
of
independence
and
that
though
we
can't
say
the
day
that
their
sovereign
nations,
some
concept
of
sovereignty
is
behind
that
as
mr.
justice
marshall
said
in
the
mcclanahan
case.
what
happened
under
this
period
of
federal
supervision
and
care
was
devastating
to
the
indian
tribes.
and
by
1934,
it
had
become
one
of
the
greater
national
scandals.
in
the
1930s,
after
50
years
of
guardianship,
both
the
administration
and
congress
decided
that
there
had
to
be
some
completely
new
system
for
handling
indian
affairs.
commissioner
of
indian
affairs,
collier
is
testifying
congress
in
1934,
pointed
out
that
during
the
years,
between
1880s
and
1934,
during
the
years,
when
the
federal
government
had
the
most
responsibility,
wars
were
over,
that
the
indians
had
been,
and
these
are
his
words
drifting
towards
complete
impoverishment.
that
they
had
been
disorganized
as
groups,
deliberately
disorganized
by
the
federal
government
as
groups
and
pushed
to
lower
social
status
as
individuals.
and
that
their
land
holdings
had
diminished
and
this
is
after
they’d
given
up
most
of
the
country.
this
is
--
their
landholdings
had
diminished
from
138
million
acres
in
1887
to
48
million
acres
in
1934
and
something
had
to
be
done.
the
purpose
of
the
indian
reorganization
act
was
to
reverse
that
trend
towards
destruction
and
not
to
strong
award,
by
ending
the
indian
allotment
policy,
which
had
led
land
go
first
indian
hands
and
then,
out
of
indian
hands.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
no,
i
think
it
was
the
latter.
this
was
lands
that
had
passed
out
of
any
kind
of
[voice
overlap]
indian
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
reform.
i
know
it’s
not
just
tribal
holding
[voice
overlap].
no,
what
he
was
referring
to
is
the
amount
of
land
that
had
been
lost
after
allotment,
where
the
land
was
allotted
and
then,
everything
that
wasn’t
allotted
was
considered
surplus
land,
and
then
it
was
just
openly
sold
off
to
non-indians,
who
created
this.
anyway,
to
end
this
abuse,
was
to
terminate
the
allotment
act
to
encourage
indian
governments
on
the
reservation
and
there
was
a
third
part,
and
that
was
to
make
the
indian
role
a
prominent
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
there
was
an
attempt
at
the
classic
problem
of
who
guards
the
guardian
and
the
federal
government
had
failed
as
a
plain
guardian,
and
it
was
felt
necessary
to
have
the
indians
participate
strongly
in
guarding
the
guardians
and
self-help,
doing
their
own
work.
a
more
radical
proposal
was
discarded,
more
radical
proposal
was
to
give
the
tribes
an
absolute
veto
or
virtually
an
absolute
veto
of
any
bureau
of
indian
affairs
person,
who
would
be
sent
to
reservation.
but
rather
than
do
that,
congress
decided
on
this
proposal
of
giving
the
preference
to
indians
and
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
i
have
some
nice
examples
of
language
from
the
congressional
record
pointing
out
the
purpose
for
this,
but
i
don’t
think
i’ll
read
them
to
you.
we
have
it
on
our
brief.
as
one
of
the
pithier
and
shorter
ones
is
by
senator
norbeck,
who
simply
said,
“i
think
we’ve
utterly
fallen
down
in
the
present
system.
the
indian
has
been
excluded.
the
reservation
has
built
up
with
white
people,
who
live
of
the
indians.”
and
other
statements
attribute
this
directly
to
the
workings
of
the
civil
service
law
and
mr.
collier
pointed
out
there
are
actually
less
indians
working
for
indian
progress
in
1934
than
in
1930
--
excuse
me,
than
in
1900.
less
percentage
of
indians
because
the
civil
service
law
had
served
to
weed
out
qualified
indians,
who
may
not
had
been
able
to
compete
with
hundreds
of
non-indian
applicants
and
there
were
many
statements
that
the
indians
should
not
have
to
compete
with
non-indians
for
the
jobs
in
their
own
service,
and
in
controlling
their
own
property.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
it
does
in
this
sense.
it
has
responsibility
for
the
--
it
has
trust
responsibility
for
all
trust
property.
some
of
the
trust
property
is
allotted,
trust
property.
so,
in
that
sense,
you
might
say
it’s
outside
of
tribal
affairs,
but
other
than
members
of
tribes
with
allotted
property,
it
only
has
jurisdiction.
its
view
is
that
it
only
has
jurisdiction
where
it’s
dealing
with
tribal
indians.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
that’s
correct,
that’s
correct.
i
want
to
point
out
also
that
this
is
not
--
well,
before
i
get
to
this,
the
act
itself,
of
course
says
specifically
that
the
preferences
to
be
without
regard
to
civil
service
laws
to
be
the
confident
indians
without
regard
to
civil
service
laws.
and
it’s
a
preference
in
the
administration
of
functions
or
services
affecting
any
indian
tribe
and
that’s
the
way
it’s
been
handled
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
i
want
to
point
also
that
there
many
indians,
many
people
who
racially
could
be
considered
an
indian,
who
don’t
get
this
preference.
for
instance,
if
someone
is
a
member
of
a
terminated
tribe,
such
as
the
clackamas
of
oregon,
their
property
is
no
longer
being
administered
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
they
don’t
get
the
preference.
somebody
is
a
member
of
a
tribe
whose
property
has
never
been
handled
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
such
passamaquoddy
in
maine,
they
don’t
get
the
preference.
if
someone
is
racially
a
pure-blooded
indian
from
canada,
from
mexico,
though
he
lived
here
three
generations,
he
doesn’t
get
the
preference.
the
preference
is
not
a
racial
preference.
it’s
a
preference
for
the
people,
whose
property
and
lives
are
affected
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
who
serve
in
that
bureau.
that’s
undisputed
in
the
record
of
this
case
testimony
to
that
effect.
now,
we
think
it’s
clear
that
the
statute
was
not
repealed
by
the
equal
employment
act
of
1972.
as
we
demonstrate
in
our
brief,
and
i
point
out
also
this
letter
from
civil
service
commission
that
makes
this
point
that’s
in
the
record
of
the
case,
civil
service
commission,
which
has
primary
responsibility
for
enforcing
equal
employment
act
of
1972
in
government
service
fully
agrees
with
this,
that
there's
not
a
word
in
the
act,
they
also
had
a
role
in
drafting,
there's
not
a
word
in
the
act
that
sets
out
to
abolish
this
indian
preference.
certainly,
the
broad
language
about
racial
preference
or
national
origin
doesn’t
do
it
itself.
the
legislative
history
shows
not
any
intention
to
change
the
indian
preference
and
it’s
in
conceivable
to
us
that
congress
in
act
setting
out
to
increase
minority
participation
in
government
would
have
abolished
the
indian
preference
without
a
word,
saying
that
they’re
doing
it.
i
think
if
they’d
intended
to
do
that,
they
would
have
done
it.
they
had
the
right
to
rely
on
the
principles
of
statutory
construction
that
this
broad
act
would
not
repeal
the
more
specific
act.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
unless,
you
focus
on
the
purpose
for
those
exceptions,
which
are
not
really
exceptions
at
all,
but
simply
a
delimitation
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
and
at
the
outer
limits
of
the
civil
service
commission
authority.
but
i’d
like
to
stay
out
of
that,
so
that
mr.
sherman
can
get
into
that.
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
am
afraid
i
did,
and
i
know
you
are
unhappy
with
me
for
saying
it
all.
[laughter]
but
i
promise
not
to
do
too
much
of
that,
but
i
want
you
to
know
that
this
is
also
the
position
of
the
united
states.
now,
to
the
constitutional
issue
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
for
a
change.
[laughter]
in
board
of
commissioners
versus
seber
upholding
an
indian
tax
immunity
against
the
constitutional
attack
on
equal
protection
grounds,
the
court
said
this,
and
i
think
the
key
to
this
case
too.
it
said
in
the
exercise
of
the
war
and
treaty
powers,
the
united
states
overcame
the
indians
and
took
possession
of
their
lands,
sometimes
by
force,
leaving
them
uneducated,
helpless,
and
dependent
people,
needing
protection
against
the
selfishness
of
others
and
their
own
of
improvidence.
of
necessity,
the
united
states
assumed
the
duty
of
furnishing
that
protection
and
with
it,
the
authority
to
do
all
that
was
required
to
perform
that
obligation
and
to
prepare
the
indians
to
take
their
places
independent,
qualified
members
of
the
modern
body
politics.
then,
actually
in
an
earlier
case,
perrin
versus
the
united
states,
in
upholding
the
laws
as
to
sale
of
liquor
to
indians
on
land
next
to
reservation,
the
court
said
that
in
determining
what
is
reasonably
essential
to
the
protection
of
the
indians,
congress
is
invested
with
wide
discretion
in
its
actions,
unless
purely
arbitrary
must
be
accepted
in
given
full
effect
by
the
courts.
now,
this
--
i
do
not
know
that
i
would
argue
for
that
broader
standard,
but
certainly
that
kind
of
standard
is
the
test
for
this
case
that
this
an
area
that
congress
has
to
deal
with.
it’s
a
difficult
area.
congress
has
dealt
with
and
in
good
faith,
and
to
great
extent
successfully
with
the
1934
reorganization
act
and
the
court
should
be
loath
to
undo
that
on
constitutional
grounds.
now
one
of
the
point
and
that
is
the
way
we
analyze
this
case,
this
is
not
really
an
equal
protection
case,
at
all
because
equal
protection
refers
to
people,
who
are
essentially
in
the
same
relationship
to
the
government,
but
the
government
then
has
passed
laws
to
treat
them
in
different
ways
and
then,
the
court
uses
its
equal
protection
analysis
to
decide
whether
the
difference
in
that
treatment
is
justifiable.
but
here,
there's
an
essential
different
relationship,
between
a
tribal
indian,
whose
tribal
property
is
being
managed
by
bia
--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
well,
i
put
this
the
other
way,
that
i
think
[voice
overlap]
this
is--
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
think
i
have
an
easier
case
from
that,
because
the
special
treatment
in
the
constitution
itself
of
indians,
the
indian
--
the
commerce
clause
and
the
long
history
of
special
legislation
in
dealing
in
indian
affairs
and
i
point
out
in
light
of
recent
decisions
of
court
in
arnett
ii
that
perhaps
a
non-indian
employee
doesn’t
have
a
vested
right
and
there’s
a
job
in
the
bia
or
if
he
does,
it’s
under
the
terms
that
comes
in
under.
but,
i
say
that
only
to
you
mr.
justice
rehnquist.[laughter]
mr.
harry
r.
sachse
i
may
have
about
30
seconds.
i
obviously
cannot
answer
all
of
these
things.
i
ask
the
court
not
to
get
into
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
preference
too
much.
that
is
in
litigation
elsewhere.
it
was
not
