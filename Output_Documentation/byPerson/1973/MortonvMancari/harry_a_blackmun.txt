there
was
one
sentence
you
didn’t
quite
finish,
it
was
the
last

justice
harry

i
want
to
be
sure
what
your
position
was
and
--
justice

incidentally
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
the
equal
employment
opportunity
act
has
some
exceptions
in
it,
doesn’t
it
mr.
sachse?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but,
it
makes
not
exception
for
indians
or
the
indian
preference
laws,
do
you
have
any
explanation
for
that?
justice
harry

of
course,
the
other
side
of
that
same
coin
is
that
if
they
had
intended
otherwise
they
would
have
relatively
exceptions,
written
into
the
exceptions.
[voice

so,
i
think
it
cuts
both
ways
really.
justice
harry

it
seems
to
me,
you
are
cutting
right
into
it,
when
you
made
the
up
closing
statement
here?

you

what
about
the
change
and
added
to
within
the
part
of
the
bureau
in
1972
as
to
promotions
and
things,
what
was
it
that
triggered
that?
justice

and
you
were
able

the
first
case
is
a
combination
of
73-362
and
73-364;
morton
against
mancari,
and
amerind
against
mancari.
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
new
mexico.
it
involves
an
apparent
conflict
between
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934
which
accords
an
employment
preference
for
qualified
indians
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
on
the
one
hand
and
the
equal
employment
opportunity
act
of
1972
is
amended,
which
prohibits
discrimination
in
employment
on
the
basis
of
race,
color,
religion,
sex,
or
national
origin.
the
1972
act
contains
no
reference
whatsoever
to
the
pre-existing
indian
preference.
the
appellees,
who
are
the
plaintiffs
in
the
litigation,
are
non-indian
bia
employees.
they
challenge
the
indian
preference
of
the
34
act
as
contrary
to
the
anti-discrimination
provisions
of
the
1972
act,
and
in
addition
as
violative
of
the
due
process
under
the
fifth
amendment.
they
claimed
specifically
that
the
72
act
with
its
broad
provisions
against
racial
discrimination
in
employment
repealed
by
implication
the
indian
preference
provisions
of
the
34
legislation.
the
three-judge
federal
district
court
in
new
mexico
decided
the
issue
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs
and
held
that
the
indian
preference
was
impliedly
repealed
by
the
later
or
1972
act.
we
reach
the
contrary
conclusion
and
for
reasons
set
forth
in
some
detail
in
the
opinion
filed
today
conclude
that
the
equal
employment
opportunity
act
did
not
repeal
the
indian
preference,
and
that
in
addition,
the
preference
itself
does
not
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
opinion
as
filed.
