mr.
harris
d.
sherman
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
concentrate
my
comments
on
the
question
of
whether
the
1972
civil
right
act
repealed
by
implication
the
indian
preference
statutes,
as
a
lower
court
so
held.
section
717
(a)
of
that
act
by
its
express
terms
bar
description
based
on
race
in
the
federal
government.
although
nowhere
in
the
terms
the
legislative
history
of
that
act
is
there
any
intention
expressed
by
congress
to
repeal
the
indian
preference
statutes,
the
district
court
held
that
the
bia
must
come
under
the
broad
terms
of
the
act,
and
thereby
repealed
by
implication
of
those
statutes.
now,
in
my
argument,
i
would
first
like
to
analyze
the
legislative
background
of
the
1972
act,
which
we
believe
without
question
shows
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
such
a
repeal.
secondly,
i
would
like
to
explain
why
the
bia
is
not
listed
as
an
exception
in
that
act.
and
lastly,
i
would
like
to
touch
on
why
we
believe
the
district
court
failed
to
apply
basic
rules
of
statutory
construction,
regarding
repeal
by
implication.
now,
if
may
first
turn
to
the
legislative
background
of
the
1972
act
because
i
think
this
is
extremely
important.
the
1972
act
amended
the
1964
act,
and
by
section
717
(a),
merely
codified
pre-existing,
non-discrimination
statutes
or
excuse
me
executive
regulations
that
existed
in
the
federal
government.
the
language
of
these
pre-existing
regulations
in
section
717
(a)
of
the
1972
act
are
virtually
identical.
now,
we
believe
this
is
important,
because
these
non-discrimination
measures
had
stood
side-by-side
with
the
indian
preference
statutes
over
the
years
and
neither
the
executive
branch
nor
legislature
viewed
indian
preference
on
the
one
hand
and
non-discrimination
on
the
other
hand
has
been
inconsistent.
and,
for
this
very
reason
congress
may
well
thought,
it
was
not
necessary
to
make
an
exception
for
the
bia
in
the
1972
civil
rights
act.
now,
let
me
give
some
examples
to
this.
a
beginning
in
the
roosevelt
administration,
there
were
executive
regulations,
which
barred
discrimination
in
the
federal
government,
and
there
had
been
successive
executive
relations
up
to
the
present
time.
at
the
same
time,
because
of
the
1934
indian
preference
statute,
both
the
bia
and
the
civil
service
commission
have
given
special
preferential
rights
to
indians,
as
opposed
to
non-indians
upon
initial
entry
into
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
neither
the
bureau
nor
the
civil
service
commission
have
seen
these
non-discrimination
policies
and
indian
preference
policies
as
being
inconsistent.
now,
another
example
of
this
is
in
1964,
when
congress
passed
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
in
barring
discrimination
in
private
employment,
congress
reaffirmed
its
belief
in
indian
preference,
by
exempting
from
the
act
indian
tribes
and
private
employers
on
or
near
reservations
to
allow
preferential
employment
treatment
for
indians.
congress
did
not
view
indian
preference
on
the
one
hand,
and
non-discrimination
on
the
other
hand,
as
being
inconsistent.
even
in
1972,
three
months,
only
three
months
after
the
1972
civil
rights
act
was
passed,
congress
passed
new
indian
preference
statutes,
giving
preferences
to
indian
teachers
and
indian
educators
in
special
indian
education
programs.
congress
in
no
way
saw
any
inconsistency
between
these
new
preference
acts
in
1972,
and
the
civil
rights
act
that
it
had
just
passed.
now,
i
want
to
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
1972
act,
mr.
sachse
has
pointed
that
nowhere
in
the
terms
of
the
act
or
in
its
legislative
history,
which
is
voluminous,
the
congress
in
any
way
say
anything
about
its
desire
to
repeal
a
138
years
of
special
indian
preference
programs.
surely,
had
congress
intended
to
do
so,
it
would
have
said
something,
especially
in
view
of
its
recent
affirmation
in
1964
and
in
1972,
with
these
new
indian
preference
laws.
i
think
at
the
very
least
congress
would
amended
the
1964
indian
preference
statute
to
do
away
with
the
private
preferential
right
that
it
given
to
indians,
if
it
intended
to
take
away
the
right
it
given
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
now,
the
logical
question
to
all
these
is
why
didn’t
congress
include
an
exemption
for
the
bia
in
the
1972
act.
well,
we
can
always
speculate
on
that,
since
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
one
way
or
the
other.
but,
i
think
the
most
plausible
explanation
is
that
congress
simply
felt
that
indian
preference
was
not
inconsistent
with
the
general
non-discrimination
prohibitions
and
therefore
it
wasn’t
necessary
to
create
an
exemption.
now,
one
reason
for
this
and
i
stress
this
is
for
the
same
reason
mr.
sachse
brought
out,
these
indian
preference
statutes
as
we
interpret
them
are
basically
not
racial
statutes.
the
thrust
of
the
indian
preference
act
was
to
give
self-determination
to
indian
people,
people
whose
lives
are
controlled
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
now,
as
mr.
sachse
point
out
there
are
many
indians
whose
lives
are
not
controlled
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
those
indians,
even
if
they
are
full-blooded
indians
don’t
qualify
for
indian
preference.
so
in
that
sense,
the
indian
preference
laws
are
more
based
on
a
federal
tribal
recognition
or
tribal
affiliation,
not
on
the
fact
that
one
is
or
is
not
an
indian.
and,
in
that
sense,
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
thought
that
these
statutes
were
based
on
a
racial
classification.
now
in
addition
to
that,
as
i
just
--
mr.
harris
d.
sherman
my
understanding
is
the
way
the
bureau
interprets
this
statute,
you
do
not
qualify
for
any
indian
preference
unless
you
are
a
present
member
of
federally-recognized
tribe.
mr.
harris
d.
sherman
it
doesn’t
mean
you
have
to
have
to
be
on
the
reservation,
that’s
correct.
mr.
harris
d.
sherman
and
you
must
be
one
one-quarter
indian-blood,
that’s
correct.
that
where
the
bureau
is
interpreting
this
statute.
now,
i
think
in
addition
to
what
i
have
just
said,
i
think
an
additional
reason
for
the
bia
not
being
part
of
this
1972
act
was
that
the
thrust
of
the
1972
act
was
to
strengthen
civil
service
commissions
and
tie
discrimination
measures.
and
this
1934
act,
as
mr.
sachse
has
said
was
instituted
giving
indians
preferences
“without
regard
to
civil
service
laws.”
we
don’t
think
congress
meant
to
do
away
with
those
preference
statutes
when
it
passed
the
1972
act.
now,
i
want
to
say
that
there
is
an
alternative
explanation
to
why
the
bureau
doesn’t
appear
in
the
act
and
that
is
simply
because
it
is
very,
very
possible
that
congress
overlooked
the
bureau
or
overlooked
indian
preference
when
it
considered
the
act.
i
think
there’s
good
evidence
to
that
in
the
sense
that
there’s
not
one
word,
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history
that
mentions
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
or
the
indian
preference
statutes.
mr.
harris
d.
sherman
well,
i
think
he
would
also
have
the
protection
of
the
office
of
the
office
[voice
overlap].
mr.
harris
d.
sherman
so
he
would
have
both
protections,
i
presume,
because
he
is
a
member
of
minority,
that’s
correct.
mr.
harris
d.
sherman
only
a
private
employer
who
is
on
or
near
reservation.
mr.
harris
d.
sherman
but
that’s
in
the
private
sector.
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
and
indian
health
service
which
is
an
[voice
overlap]
i
also
want
to
deal
briefly
with
the
issue
of
statutory
construction
as
it
applies
to
repeal
by
implication.
appellees
have
contended
that
the
terms
of
the
indian
preference
statute
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
1972
are
in
conflict,
and
thus,
the
indian
preference
statutes
because
their
earlier
statutes
must
give
way
to
the
latter
statute.
now,
quite
to
the
contrary,
the
rules
of
this
court
generally
have
been
that
repeal
by
implication
of
a
special
statute
by
a
general
statute
will
not
take
place.
now,
i
want
to
stress
that
in
our
view,
this
indian
preference
statutes
without
question
are
special
statutes,
they
only
apply
to
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
and
indian
health
service
and
in
only
in
a
very
limited
way.
on
the
other
hand,
the
1972
civil
rights
act
without
question
is
a
general
statute.
it
applies
to
virtually
the
entire
federal
government.
now,
if
the
terms
of
the
special
and
general
statutes
are
in
conflict,
the
prior
special
statute
will
normally
become
an
exception
to
the
general
statute,
unless
the
legislative
history
of
the
general
statute
could
be
demonstrated
to
have
expressly
intended
to
repeal
the
earlier
statute
which
clearly
is
not
the
case
here
because
we
don’t
have
one
word
relating
to
intentional
repeal
indian
preference
or
if
the
basic
goal
of
the
general
statute
would
be
entirely
defeated,
if
the
earlier
legislation
were
to
stand.
now
the
1972
civil
rights
act
stands
almost
in
its
entirety
intact.
it
applies
virtually
all
agencies
of
the
federal
government.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
applies
to
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
racial
discrimination,
sex
discrimination,
religious
discrimination
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
is
precluded.
only
when
an
indian
and
a
non-indian
compete
for
a
vacancy
and
the
indian
is
qualified
for
that
job
and
he
is
from
a
federally
recognized
tribe
does
he
received
the
preference.
otherwise,
the
1972
civil
rights
act
in
all
other
respects
applies
to
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
now,
lastly,
i
would
like
to
just
comment
on
what
concerns
the
appellant
amerind
greatly
in
this
case.
if
indian
preferences
be
repealed
or
which
to
be
found
unconstitutional,
we
believe
this
would
have
a
devastating
effect
on
the
bureau
or
indian
affairs
and
on
indian
employment
and
i
would
like
to
briefly
explain
this.
our
brief
does
go
into
the
fact
that
almost
all
indians
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
enter
the
indian
service
through
what
is
called
the
accepted
service.
this
is
a
special
exemption
by
which
indians,
they
have
to
be
qualified,
but
they
do
not
have
to
take
civil
service
examinations
and
they
don’t
have
to
place
their
names
on
federal
employment
registers.
now
the
reason
for
this
accepted
service
was
that
the
1934
congress
realized
that
civil
service
examinations
had
long
excluded
qualified
indians.
they
simply
did
not
measure
indian
ability,
indian
potential.
so
the
accepted
service
was
setup
and
the
authority
for
the
accepted
service
in
the
bia
was
none
other
than
this
1934
indian
preference
act.
so,
what
concerns
us
is
if
you
take
away
indian
preference,
then
you
in
turn
take
away
the
accepted
service
and
that
has
been
the
major
vehicle
by
which,
literally
thousands
of
indians
have
been
able
to
come
in
to
their
own
service
and
work
for
their
own
people.
and
as
exhibit
a
of
our
reply
brief
shows
that
the
study
by
the
civil
service
commission
of
indians
and
other
federal
indian
agencies
in
two
popular
states,
arizona
and
new
mexico,
indians
have
been
virtually
shut
out
of
those
agencies.
as
that
report
explains,
one
of
the
reasons
is
that
indians
have
not
been
able
to
compete
successfully
for
civil
service
examinations
which
don’t
measure
their
true
ability.
we
are
very
worried
this
same
thing
would
happen
to
the
bia
if
preference
were
taken
from
indians
and
if
the
accepted
service
were
taken
from
indians
and
that
clearly
would
defeat
the
congressional
intent
of
allowing
indian
self
determination
in
their
own
affairs.
so
in
sum,
we
believe
that
if
the
lower
court
had
carefully
considered
the
legislative
background
of
the
1972
act
which
it
did
not
and
if
the
lower
court
had
applied
basic
rules
of
statutory
construction
relating
to
special
and
general
statutes
which
it
did
not,
indian
preference
would
have
been
allowed
to
stand
and
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
should
be
reversed.
i
have
nothing
further
unless
the
court
has
some
questions.
mr.
harris
d.
sherman
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
concentrate
my
comments
on
the
question
of
whether
the
1972
civil
right
act
repealed
by
implication
the
indian
preference
statutes,
as

if
may

because
i
think
this
is
extremely
important.
the

amended
the
1964

and
by

in

now,
we
believe
this
is
important,
because
these
non-discrimination

had
stood
side-by-side
with
the
indian

statutes
over
the
years
and
neither
the
executive
branch

on

non-discrimination

congress

give

which
barred

and
there
had

at
the

time,
because
of

both
the
bia
and
the

have
given
special
preferential

neither
the

nor

have
seen
these
non-discrimination
policies
and
indian
preference
policies
as
being
inconsistent.
now,
another
example
of
this
is
in
1964,
when
congress
passed
the
1964
civil
rights
act.
in
barring
discrimination
in
private
employment,
congress
reaffirmed
its
belief
in
indian
preference,
by
exempting
from
the
act
indian
tribes
and
private
employers
on
or

reservations
to
allow
preferential
employment
treatment
for
indians.
congress
did
not
view
indian
preference
on
the
one
hand,
and
non-discrimination
on
the
other
hand,
as
being
inconsistent.
even
in
1972,
three
months,
only
three
months
after
the
1972
civil
rights
act
was
passed,
congress
passed
new
indian
preference
statutes,
giving
preferences
to
indian
teachers
and
indian
educators
in
special
indian
education
programs.
congress
in
no
way
saw
any
inconsistency
between
these
new
preference
acts
in
1972,
and
the
civil
rights
act
that
it
had
just
passed.
now,
i
want
to
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
1972
act,
mr.
sachse
has
pointed
that
nowhere
in
the
terms
of
the
act
or
in
its
legislative
history,
which
is
voluminous,
the
congress
in
any
way
say
anything
about
its
desire
to
repeal
a
138
years
of
special
indian
preference
programs.
surely,
had
congress
intended
to
do
so,
it
would
have
said
something,
especially
in
view
of
its
recent
affirmation
in
1964
and
in
1972,
with
these
new
indian
preference
laws.
i
think
at
the
very
least
congress
would
amended
the
1964
indian
preference
statute
to
do
away
with
the
private
preferential
right
that
it
given
to
indians,
if
it
intended
to
take
away
the
right
it
given
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
now,
the
logical
question
to
all
these
is
why
didn’t
congress
include
an
exemption
for
the
bia
in
the
1972
act.
well,
we
can
always
speculate
on
that,
since
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
one
way
or
the
other.
but,
i
think
the
most
plausible
explanation
is
that
congress
simply
felt
that
indian
preference
was
not
inconsistent
with
the
general
non-discrimination
prohibitions
and
therefore
it
wasn’t
necessary
to
create
an
exemption.
now,
one
reason
for
this
and
i
stress
this
is
for
the
same
reason
mr.
sachse
brought
out,
these
indian
preference
statutes
as
we
interpret
them
are
basically
not
racial
statutes.
the
thrust
of
the
indian
preference
act
was
to
give
self-determination
to
indian
people,
people
whose
lives
are
controlled
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
now,
as
mr.
sachse
point
out
there
are
many
indians
whose
lives
are
not
controlled
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
those
indians,
even
if
they
are
full-blooded
indians
don’t
qualify
for
indian
preference.
so
in
that
sense,
the
indian
preference
laws
are
more
based
on
a
federal
tribal
recognition
or
tribal
affiliation,
not
on
the
fact
that
one
is
or
is
not
an
indian.
and,
in
that
sense,
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
thought
that
these
statutes
were
based
on
a
racial
classification.
now
in
addition
to
that,
as
i
just
--
mr.
harris
d.
sherman
my
understanding
is
the
way
the
bureau
interprets
this
statute,
you
do
not
qualify
for
any
indian
preference
unless
you
are
a
present
member
of
federally-recognized
tribe.
mr.
harris
d.
sherman
it
doesn’t
mean
you
have
to
have
to
be
on
the
reservation,
that’s
correct.
mr.
harris
d.
sherman
and
you
must
be
one
one-quarter
indian-blood,
that’s
correct.
that
where
the
bureau
is
interpreting
this
statute.
now,
i
think
in
addition
to
what
i
have
just
said,
i
think
an
additional
reason
for
the
bia
not
being
part
of
this
1972
act
was
that
the
thrust
of
the
1972
act
was
to
strengthen
civil
service
commissions
and
tie
discrimination
measures.
and
this
1934
act,
as
mr.
sachse
has
said
was
instituted
giving
indians
preferences
“without
regard
to
civil
service
laws.”
we
don’t
think
congress
meant
to
do
away
with
those
preference
statutes
when
it
passed
the
1972
act.
now,
i
want
to
say
that
there
is
an
alternative
explanation
to
why
the
bureau
doesn’t
appear
in
the
act
and
that
is
simply
because
it
is
very,
very
possible
that
congress
overlooked
the
bureau
or
overlooked
indian
preference
when
it
considered
the
act.
i
think
there’s
good
evidence
to
that
in
the
sense
that
there’s
not
one
word,
anywhere
in
the
legislative
history
that
mentions
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
or
the
indian
preference
statutes.
mr.
harris
d.
sherman
well,
i
think
he
would
also
have
the
protection
of
the
office
of
the
office
[voice
overlap].
mr.
harris
d.
sherman
so
he
would
have
both
protections,
i
presume,
because
he
is
a
member
of
minority,
that’s
correct.
mr.
harris
d.
sherman
only
a
private
employer
who
is
on
or
near
reservation.
mr.
harris
d.
sherman
but
that’s
in
the
private
sector.
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
and
indian
health
service
which
is
an
[voice
overlap]
i
also
want
to
deal
briefly
with
the
issue
of
statutory
construction
as
it
applies
to
repeal
by
implication.
appellees
have
contended
that
the
terms
of
the
indian
preference
statute
and
the
civil
rights
act
of
1972
are
in
conflict,
and
thus,
the
indian
preference
statutes
because
their
earlier
statutes
must
give
way
to
the
latter
statute.
now,
quite
to
the
contrary,
the
rules
of
this
court
generally
have
been
that
repeal
by
implication
of
a
special
statute
by
a
general
statute
will
not
take
place.
now,
i
want
to
stress
that
in
our
view,
this
indian
preference
statutes
without
question
are
special
statutes,
they
only
apply
to
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
and
indian
health
service
and
in
only
in
a
very
limited
way.
on
the
other
hand,
the
1972
civil
rights
act
without
question
is
a
general
statute.
it
applies
to
virtually
the
entire
federal
government.
now,
if
the
terms
of
the
special
and
general
statutes
are
in
conflict,
the
prior
special
statute
will
normally
become
an
exception
to
the
general
statute,
unless
the
legislative
history
of
the
general
statute
could
be
demonstrated
to
have
expressly
intended
to
repeal
the
earlier
statute
which
clearly
is
not
the
case
here
because
we
don’t
have
one
word
relating
to
intentional
repeal
indian
preference
or
if
the
basic
goal
of
the
general
statute
would
be
entirely
defeated,
if
the
earlier
legislation
were
to
stand.
now
the
1972
civil
rights
act
stands
almost
in
its
entirety
intact.
it
applies
virtually
all
agencies
of
the
federal
government.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
applies
to
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
racial
discrimination,
sex
discrimination,
religious
discrimination
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
is
precluded.
only
when
an
indian
and
a
non-indian
compete
for
a
vacancy
and
the
indian
is
qualified
for
that
job
and
he
is
from
a
federally
recognized
tribe
does
he
received
the
preference.
otherwise,
the
1972
civil
rights
act
in
all
other
respects
applies
to
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
now,
lastly,
i
would
like
to
just
comment
on
what
concerns
the
appellant
amerind
greatly
in
this
case.
if
indian
preferences
be
repealed
or
which
to
be
found
unconstitutional,
we
believe
this
would
have
a
devastating
effect
on
the
bureau
or
indian
affairs
and
on
indian
employment
and
i
would
like
to
briefly
explain
this.
our
brief
does
go
into
the
fact
that
almost
all
indians
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
enter
the
indian
service
through
what
is
called
the
accepted
service.
this
is
a
special
exemption
by
which
indians,
they
have
to
be
qualified,
but
they
do
not
have
to
take
civil
service
examinations
and
they
don’t
have
to
place
their
names
on
federal
employment
registers.
now
the
reason
for
this
accepted
service
was
that
the
1934
congress
realized
that
civil
service
examinations
had
long
excluded
qualified
indians.
they
simply
did
not
measure
indian
ability,
indian
potential.
so
the
accepted
service
was
setup
and
the
authority
for
the
accepted
service
in
the
bia
was
none
other
than
this
1934
indian
preference
act.
so,
what
concerns
us
is
if
you
take
away
indian
preference,
then
you
in
turn
take
away
the
accepted
service
and
that
has
been
the
major
vehicle
by
which,
literally
thousands
of
indians
have
been
able
to
come
in
to
their
own
service
and
work
for
their
own
people.
and
as
exhibit
a
of
our
reply
brief
shows
that
the
study
by
the
civil
service
commission
of
indians
and
other
federal
indian
agencies
in
two
popular
states,
arizona
and
new
mexico,
indians
have
been
virtually
shut
out
of
those
agencies.
as
that
report
explains,
one
of
the
reasons
is
that
indians
have
not
been
able
to
compete
successfully
for
civil
service
examinations
which
don’t
measure
their
true
ability.
we
are
very
worried
this
same
thing
would
happen
to
the
bia
if
preference
were
taken
from
indians
and
if
the
accepted
service
were
taken
from
indians
and
that
clearly
would
defeat
the
congressional
intent
of
allowing
indian
self
determination
in
their
own
affairs.
so
in
sum,
we
believe
that
if
the
lower
court
had
carefully
considered
the
legislative
background
of
the
1972
act
which
it
did
not
and
if
the
lower
court
had
applied
basic
rules
of
statutory
construction
relating
to
special
and
general
statutes
which
it
did
not,
indian
preference
would
have
been
allowed
to
stand
and
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
should
be
reversed.
i
have
nothing
further
unless
the
court
has
some
questions.
