mr.
gene
e.
franchini
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court
your
honors.
there
are
still
basically
two
issues
presented
before
this
court
here
today
your
honors.
the
first
one
being
whether
or
not
the
1972
equal
employment
opportunity
act
repealed
the
1934
indian
preference
acts
by
implication
or
whether
that
tacitly
did
so.
the
second
question
i
think
that
is
presented
to
the
court
is
whether
or
not
the
indian
preference
acts
passed
some
40
years
ago,
i
am
talking
specifically
about
the
1934
act
your
honors,
is
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
america.
now,
with
regard
to
the
statement
of
the
case
presented
to
you
here
this
afternoon,
your
honors
by
appellant,
i
would
like
to
bring
out
a
couple
of
factors
with
regard
to
bia
that
the
court
may
or
may
not
be
aware
of.
first
of
all,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
your
honors,
has
a
dual
function
and
that
dual
functions
are
these.
number
one,
it
acts
as
a
trustee
for
certain
properties
for
the
indian
nations
and
secondly
it
provides
services
to
indians
through
other
federal
and
state
agencies.
now,
when
i
say
provide
services,
i
am
talking
about
such
things
as
school
construction,
maintenance
of
schools,
some
teachers,
providing
power
or
water
for
irrigation
or
for
lights.
there
are
some
health
services
that
are
put
through
hew
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
they
are
limited
to
indians,
yes,
your
honor,
but
they
are
services
rendered
to
indians.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
not
to
nobody
else
through
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
no,
your
honor
justice
white.
i
am
not
here
to
argue
that
point
with
regard
to
services
under
[voice
overlap].
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
and
that
they
will
promote
only
indians.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
no,
your
honor
i
don’t
and
for
this
reason,
justice
white,
i
think
that
it’s
clear
and
it
has
been
clear
that
congress’
power
with
regard
to
indians
is
almost
plenary.
they
have
treated
the
indians
as
a
subjugated
people
for
very
many,
many
years
and
that
their
powers
over
the
indian
nations
have
been
plenary
in
this
regard.
what
we
are
dealing
with
in
this
particular
case
are
government
employees
who
are
indian
members
of
the
bia
as
opposed
to
government
employees
in
the
bia
who
are
non-indians
and
this
court
and
the
congress
and
the
president
can
give
as
many
rights
as
they
want
to,
to
these
indians,
to
these
people.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
what
makes
this
illegal,
what
makes
this
particular
act
illegal
that
we
are
talking
about
and
making
it
unconstitutional
is
that
they
are
taking
away
from
other
government
employees
who
are
non-indians
to
give
the
indians
the
rights.
they
are
taking
the
rights
from
the
non-indian
employees
of
the
bia
to
give
the
rights
to
the
indian
employees
of
the
bia.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
everything
else
being
equal
if
he
is
qualified.
we
have
a
question
of
qualification
here
whether
or
not
the
indian
member
as
opposed
to
the
non-indian
member.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
not
so
long
as,
your
honor,
the
indian
is
qualified
and
can
pass
the
civil
service
examinations.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
oh,
yes
i
do.
yes,
your
honor,
in
that
regard.
[voice
overlap]
yes,
justice
white?
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
the
right
that
the
non-indian
employee
has
in
the
bia
is
his
right
to
his
job.
if
he
is
doing
a
good
job
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
if
they
are
applying
for
the
job
and
they
are
qualified
for
the
job
and
there
are
no
qualified
indians
available
for
the
job,
they
have
a
right
to
get
the
job.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
certainly
and
they
have
a
right
to
their
promotions
when
those
become
available
which
have
not
been
applied
as
far
as
the
way
this
act
is
presently
being
applied
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
your
honor
i
am
not
here
to
argue
the
matter
of
veteran’s
preferences
and
i
am
really
not
as
familiar
with
veteran’s
preferences
with
regard
to
these
kinds
of
acts.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
oh,
i
realize
that
they
exists
your
honor.
i
realize
that
they
exist.
the
point
that
i
am
trying
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
the
thing
that
makes
this
matter
unconstitutional,
justice
marshall,
is
not
so
much
giving
a
qualified
indian
job
over
a
qualified
non-indian,
but
when
they
are
both
already
employees
of
a
federal
agency
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
we
are
talking
here
in
this
case
your
honor
not
for
people
that
are
applying
for
the
job
but
promotions
within
the
agency
itself.
not
initial
hiring,
we
are
talking
about
promotions,
justice
marshall.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
if
the
qualifications
are
equal
your
honor.
from
a
practical
standpoint,
without
a
federal
statute,
probably,
the
indian
would
have
preference
over
the
non-indian
in
the
bia.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
no,
your
honor.
we
think
that
that’s
unconstitutional
as
well.
it’s
part
of
the
same
section
of
the
act
that
we’re
talking
about
here.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
no,
your
honor.
i
am
saying
that
the
indian
--
the
non-indian
employees
in
the
bia
who
are
employees
right
now
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
the
appellees
in
this
case
are
all
[voice
overlap].
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
what
we
are
talking
about
here
though,
your
honor,
in
deference
to
--
in
deference
to
what
your
first
problem
was
is
that
in
this
case
all
of
the
appellees
in
this
case
are
non-indian
employees
of
the
bia
right
now
and
they
have
been
denied
promotions
in
their
jobs.
they
have
been
denied
advancement
in
their
jobs
even
though
they
are
qualified
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
no
your
honor.
they
did
not
know
that
when
they
took
the
job.
that
is
the
reasons
that
we're
before
the
court
today.
what
makes
this
unconstitutional,
justice
marshall,
is
what
i
am
saying
is
they
can
have
all
of
the
rights
that
they
want,
all
of
the
privileges
that
they
want.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
1934
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor.
it
has
been
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
just
the
initial
hiring.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
not
as
to
promotion.
this
is
a
brand
new
thing
that
has
come
up,
justice
marshall
and
justice
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
that’s
true.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
i
don’t
know
whether
we
have
had
any
displaced
employees.
i
doubt
it,
justice
blackmun.
what
i
was
talking
about
are
qualified
non-indian
employees
not
being
promoted
and
not
being
advanced
within
the
bia
although
they
are
qualified
to
be
advanced.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
we
are
saying
that
the
entire
indian
preference
statute
that
was
passed
in
1934
is
no
longer
necessary
in
1974
and
that
it
is
in
fact
unconstitutional,
justice
rehnquist.
yes,
that
is
what
we
are
saying.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
no,
but
that
is
not
the
case
that
we
have
before
the
bar,
justice
rehnquist.
that’s
really,
the
problem
has
faced
--
facing
this
court
here
today.
now,
we
are
saying
in
the
first
instance
your
honors
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
justice
blackmun?
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
i
do
not
know
exactly
what
triggered
it
your
honor.
in
1972
or
shortly
thereafter,
it
became
a
policy
of
the
department
of
the
interior
and
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
to
advance
the
indian
employees
of
the
bia
over
the
non-indian
employees
of
the
bia
and
they
were,
as
we
maintain
here
today,
subsequently
discriminated
against
because
of
that
reason.
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
this
case
has
come
before
this
court
so
that
this
court
can
determine
whether
or
not
the
actions
taken
by
bia
at
that
time
are
in
fact
constitutional
or
unconstitutional.
with
regard
to
the
argument
about
the
1972
act
repealing
by
implication
the
1934
indian
preference
statute
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
point
out
this.
that
at
no
time,
at
no
time,
your
honors,
during
the
course
of
the
briefs
or
during
the
course
of
the
argument
that
we
have
heard
from
the
appellants,
do
the
appellants
at
all
deny
that
the
indian
employees
of
bia
are
government
employees
and
subject
to
the
rules
and
regulations
laid
down
in
the
statutes
that
we
are
talking
about
here
today.
there
has
been
no
objection
and
no
exception
either
in
the
court
below
or
before
this
court
that
they
are
government
employees.
now,
the
1964
equal
employment
opportunity
act,
which
apply
to
private
employers,
contained
an
exception
for
indians
living
on
or
near
a
reservation,
and
i
pointed
that
out
that
this
exception
was
made
for
those
businesses
or
enterprises
operating
on
or
near
a
reservation
with
a
publicly
announced
policy,
your
honors,
of
aiding
and
assisting
indians.
eight
years
later,
in
1972,
when
they
took
the
1964
act
and
applied
it
to
federal
employees,
there
is
no
exception
in
the
act
with
regard
to
bia
or
bia
employees,
none,
your
honors,
it
is
absolutely
absent.
in
the
briefs,
i
have
pointed
out
that
as
a
matter
of
congressional
record,
both
senator
bird
of
west
virginia
and
also
senator
humphrey
of
the
state
of
minnesota,
have
made
extensive
remarks
during
the
course
of
the
passage
of
the
1972
act
applying
to
all
federal
employees.
and
i
think
that
senator
bird’s
remarks
are
probably
even
more
apropos
here
than
in
any
other
time.
he
said,
“i
do
not
favor
special
treatment
or
special
consideration
or
favored
employment
of
any
individual
on
the
basis
of
that
person's
being
black
or
white
or
male
or
female.”
not
withstanding
what
i
have
just
said,
the
fact
remains
that
discrimination
in
employment
on
the
basis
of
race
does
exist
and
discrimination
against
sex
does
persist.
wherever
there
is
such
a
discrimination
in
employment,
it
is
violative
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
in
other
words,
he
should
rise
or
fall
on
the
basis
of
merit,
not
on
the
basis
of
his
race
or
religion
or
sex.
every
qualified
individual,
whether
he
be
black,
white
or
else,
should
be
given
an
equal
chance
and
not
preferential
treatment
in
an
employment.
we
would
also
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
section
105
of
title
v
of
the
united
states
code
specifically
lists
therein,
your
honors,
executive
department.
now,
executive
department
includes
the
department
of
the
interior
and
is
referred
to
and
included
in
section
717
of
the
1972
act.
now
if
congress
had
not
intended
to
refuse
to
make
an
exception
based
upon
race
in
government
employment,
why
would
they
include
it
in
the
definition.
in
other
words,
congress
did
not
intend
to
exclude
namely
indian
preference
that
which
they
specifically
included
in
the
act.
when
the
appellants
argue,
your
honors,
that
the
1972
act
is
a
general
statute
and
the
indian
preference
statutes
are
specific
legislation
and
that
therefore,
the
latter
should
be
upheld
in
resolving
conflicts,
i
think
we
are
talking
about
semantics.
they
both
cover
the
same
principle
that
we
are
talking
about
here,
your
honors.
they
both
cover
government
employment.
they
are
of
equal
import.
they
should
be
read
together
and
if
the
conflict
cannot
be
resolved
between
the
two,
then
the
most
recent
civil
rights
legislation
giving
us
freedom
from
discrimination
based
upon
sex,
race,
creed
or
color
is
the
one
that
should
be
upheld
and
not
vice
versa,
an
indian
preference
act
passed
40
years
ago,
when
the
situation
today
is
much
different.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
again,
your
honor,
this
is
an
act
of
congress
giving
the
opportunity
to
indian
young
men
and
women
to
become
educated
so
that
they
can
go
back
to
the
indian
schools
and
teach
the
indian-americans
what
life
is
like
outside
of
that
reservation;
that
non-indian
world
and
that
is
perfectly
alright.
we
are
not
talking
about
that
kind
of
an
action
being
unconstitutional,
but
i
fail
to
see
its
applicability
with
regard
to
our
first
argument,
the
1972
act
in
fact
impliedly
repealed
the
act
of
1934.
this
is
another
action
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
give
to
the
indian-american
another
way
out
of
this
prison
that
he
has
been
put
in
by
virtue
of
this
indian
preference.
what
we
are
saying
to
these
people
are,
“you
are
american
citizens.
you
are
citizens
of
the
united
states
of
america.
however,
there
is
something
different
about
you
so
we
have
to
take
special
preferential
care
of
you”
and
i
think
that
is
what
we
wanted
to
do.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
considerable
information
in
the
record
with
regard
to
that.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
point
to
the
record
at
page
41
with
regard
to
the
employment
in
the
bia.
the
court
would
turn
to
page
41,
justice
marshall.
that
bia
data,
at
the
top
of
that
page,
indicates
who
are
the
majority
and
who
are
the
minority
employees
of
the
bia.
at
the
present
time,
within
the
bia,
there
are
8,347
indian
employees
and
7,176
non-indian
employees
or
a
total
of
15,523
human
beings
working
within
that
area.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
the
percentage
was
much
lower
as
was
counted
by
--
as
was
stipulated
by
a
counsel
in
his
opening
remarks
in
1930
and
between
1930
and
1934
there
were
very
few
indian
employees
in
what
was
then
called
the
indian
service.
but
the
indian
service
in
those
days
really
did
have
something
to
say
about
the
life
and
politics
of
indian
[voice
overlap].
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor.
they
are
better
off
than
they
were
in
1934;
much
better
off.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
[laughter]
i
think
so.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
justice
marshall,
recently
in
the
bureau
of
vital
statistics
of
the
united
states,
where
in
the
1940s,
i
think
the
average
age
of
the
indian-american
who
died
was
40.
it
is
now
something
like
68.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
[laughter
attempt]
repealed
it
by
implication.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
that
is
the
second
argument,
your
honor
and
i
am
going
to
get
to
that
very
shortly.
i
think
that
it
was
repealed
by
the
1972
equal
employment
opportunity
act
and
even
it
was
not,
it
is
still
an
unconstitutional
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
no,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor,
i
am
really
serious
that
i
think
that
it
repealed
it.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
[laughter]
that’s
true,
your
honor.
they
were
very,
very
specific
on
the
point.
as
part
of
the
jurisdictional
statements,
this
honorable
court
has
the
entire
opinion
of
the
court
below.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
they
were
convinced
that
it
was
repealed.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
no,
your
honor,
you
can’t.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
bia
today
is
in
a
state
of
upheaval.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
if
there
was
a
conflict
and
they
have
to
be
read
in
pari
materia
to
one
another
and
that
the
1972
act
being
the
more
recent,
civil
rights
legislation
repealed
the
1934
act.
that’s
exactly
the
point,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor;
justice
seth,
who
is
the
chief
justice
of
the
tenth
circuit
and
two
district
judges
from
albuquerque.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
that’s
correct,
justice
white
[laughter].
justice
seth
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor,
you
sure
can.
you
surely
can
sir.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
i
think
they
went
a
little
bit
further
than
that
your
honor.
but
this
is
a
question
of
an
interpretation
of
what
the
lower
court
held
and
certainly,
justice
marshall,
you
have
the
right
to
read
it
in
that
fashion.
with
regard
to
the
unconstitutional
aspect
of
the
1934
indian
preference
acts,
your
honor,
the
appellees
here
are
a
woman,
a
jewish
man,
a
mexican-american
and
a
black
american,
all
non-indian
employees
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
none
of
them
are
employed,
your
honors,
on
or
near
a
reservation,
none
of
them.
they
all
perform
technical
administerial
task
and
no
claim
has
ever
been
made
that
they
make
any
decisions
at
all
involving
indian
matters
or
participation
in
government.
for
that
matter,
your
honor,
our
point
in
the
brief
is,
is
that
the
bia
today
does
not
make
decisions
for
the
indian
tribes.
those
decisions
that
govern
their
everyday
lives
are
not
made
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
they
are
made
in
a
tribal
councils
on
the
reservations.
and
we
are
contending
that
the
indian
preference
acts
of
1934
discriminate
against
them
on
racial
basis
in
promotion
to
positions
that
are
likewise
not
on
or
near
a
reservation,
but
as
a
matter
of
practical
fact,
in
the
indian
polytechnical
school
in
albuquerque,
new
mexico
which
is
not
on
the
reservation.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
i
don’t
know
whether
the
secretary
of
the
interiors
ever
advised
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
there
are
some
things
in
this
brief,
justice
rehnquist,
that
indicate
that
perhaps
that
may
not
be
the
case.
i
think
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
mr.
rogers
c.b.
morton,
realizes
also
that
with
this
preference
act
that
we
have
now
applied,
that
the
non-indian
employees
of
the
bia
are
in
fact
second
class
citizens.
and
they
are
not
being
provided
with
their
constitutional
rights
in
having
their
jobs,
not
having
the
ability
to
be
advanced
in
their
jobs
and
promoted
in
their
jobs,
then
of
course
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
mr.
morton,
roger
c.b.
morton,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
one
of
the
appellants
your
honor.
amerind
inc.
is
the
--
an
indian
organization
for
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
he
is
the
--
one
of
the
appellants.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
i
think
he
does
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
[laughter]
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
i
do
not
think
they
are
in
agreement
on
this
one
neither
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
i
hope
so.
i
think
that
is
the
way
i
read
it
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
on
the
issue
of
as
to
whether
or
not
with
the
existence
of
the
indian
preference,
justice
stewart,
the
non-indian
employees
that
i
represent
are
in
fact
second
class
citizens
in
this
country.
because
of
the
--
their
inability
to
be
promoted,
their
inability
to
be
advanced
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
and
they
do
not
disagree
that
they
are
every
bit,
the
indian
employees
are
every
bit
as
much
governmental
employees
as
mine
on
indian
clients.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
i
think
so
your
honor.
you
see,
we
are
talking
about
two
different
things
here
with
indian
preference,
your
honor.
judge
rehnquist,
if
i
could
just
take
a
moment
i
will
try
to
explain.
an
indian
is
defined
in
these
series
of
acts.
section
479
of
25
u.s.c.
defines
indians
for
the
purpose
of
this
indian
preference
as
follows.
an
indian
as
used
in
these
sections
including
indian
preference
shall
include
all
persons
of
indian
descent
who
are
members
of
any
recognized
indian
tribe
now
under
federal
jurisdiction.
and
all
persons
who
are
descendant
of
such
members
who
were
on
june
1,
1934
residing
within
the
present
boundaries
of
any
indian
reservation,
and
shall
further
include
all
other
persons
of
one-half
or
more
indian
blood.
when
we
are
talking
about
whether
or
not
an
indian
person
is
a
member
of
a
tribe,
some
tribes
require
a
blood
quantum,
some
do
not.
but
as
far
as
the
preference
acts
that
we
are
talking
about
here,
your
honor,
are
concerned,
they
have
to
have
--
they
are
supposed
to
have
one-half
or
more
indian
blood,
but
there
is
no
objection
and
there
is
no
argument
on
the
part
of
the
appellants
that
they
are
in
fact
applying
a
one-quarter
indian
blood
test
to
exercise
these
preferences.
and
i
don’t
believe
that
there
has
ever
been
argument
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
or
the
secretary
that
they
are
not
applying
that
basis.
now,
when
they
passed
this
act,
and
this
is
i
think
very,
very
interesting.
when
congress
passed
this
act
in
1934
giving
indians
preference,
they
said
in
section
478
of
title
25
u.s.c.,
sections
461,
462,
463,
464,
465,
466
through
470
and
471
through
473,
and
that
includes
the
indian
preference
because
472
is
the
indian
preference,
of
this
title
shall
not
apply
to
any
reservation
wherein
the
majority
of
the
adult
indians
voting
at
a
special
election
duly
called
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
shall
vote
against
its
application.
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
secretary
of
the
interior
within
one
year
after
june
18,
1934
to
call
such
an
election
which,
election
shall
be
held
by
secret
ballot
upon
thirty
days
notice.
that
election
was
held
your
honors
and
i
think
that
it
was
clearly
congress’
intent
that
section
472,
which
were
the
indian
preference
acts,
should
not
apply
to
any
reservation
where
the
male
members
of
the
tribe
voted
against
its
application.
as
a
matter
of
practical
fact,
the
largest
[attempt
to
laughter]
indian
reservation
in
the
united
states
today,
namely
the
navajo
reservation
that
come
from
where
i
come
from,
new
mexico
and
arizona,
voted
against
it.
and
the
tribal
operations
records
within
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
will
show
that
many
other
reservations
also
rejected,
chapter
576
in
total.
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
your
honor,
provides
in
part
that
citizens
of
the
united
states
shall
not
be
deprived
life,
liberty,
and
property
without
due
process
of
law.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
that
seems
to
me
to
have
been
the
intent
of
the
law.
now,
i
must
point
out
to
you
though,
justice
white,
that
in
the
lower
court,
they
took
a
different
view
of
that.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
the
preference
would
apply.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
these
preferences
were
granted
or
the
appellees
in
the
case
were
not
promoted
off
the
reservation
in
albuquerque
at
an
indian
school,
a
polytechnical
school
in
albuquerque,
new
mexico.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
probably,
your
honor.
justice
white,
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
the
section
is
--
that
the
section
was
in
there
as
part
of
the
indian
preference
act
to
see
whether
or
not
the
reservations
and
the
indians,
all
indians
of
one-half
blood
really
wanted
this
to
be
a
preference.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
that’s
true,
your
honor.
in
this
particular
case,
this
failure
to
promote
an
advance
qualified
personnel
happened
off
the
reservation,
in
the
city,
in
a
bia
run
school
for
indian
children.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
the
case
of
the
board
of
county
commissioners
versus
seber
which
has
been
quoted
by
counsel
for
the
appellants,
appellees
do
not
feel,
decide
the
issue
or
the
issues
in
this
case.
that
case
decided
an
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
tax
exemption
statutes
were
violative
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
it
had
to
with
whether
or
not
the
rights
of
individual
indians
and
the
united
states
as
a
trustee
of
property
had
anything
to
do
with
the
taxation
part
of
the
matter.
it
did
not
involve
the
dispute
between
property
rights
of
indians
and
non-indians.
it
had
to
do
with
something
entirely
different
than
that.
the
other
case
that
is
cited
by
the
appellants
in
their
briefs
and
during
their
argument
i
think
your
honors,
none
go
to
the
point
in
issues
here.
there
are
the
points
in
issue
here.
it
is
a
proposition
and
a
stand
from
the
proposition
that
the
indians
have
a
different
and
probably
a
very
unique
position
with
regard
to
other
people
in
the
united
states
of
america,
but
it
does
not
decide
whether
or
not
you
can
deprive
a
government
employee
in
the
bia
advancement
in
his
position
when
he
is
qualified
because
of
an
indian
preference
act.
we
believe
that
that
is
contrary
to
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
it
is
a
distinction
based
upon
race.
we
are
talking
about
one
quarter
indian
blood.
when
we
start
talking
about
blood,
we
are
talking
about
race
here,
your
honors
and
i
think
that
that
is
clearly
the
issue
here.
that
this
is
strictly
a
racial
preference
and
this
is
strictly
a
preference
based
upon
race
and
nothing
more
or
less
than
that.
finally,
your
honors,
i
would
like
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
case
of
griggs
versus
duke
power
company
in
401
u.s.
424.
at
page
400
of
that
opinion,
the
chief
justice
who,
unfortunately
is
not
with
us
here
today,
wrote
an
opinion
and
part
of
that
opinion
i
think
is
very,
very
pertinent
here.
it
says
that
congress
did
not
intend
by
title
vii
however,
to
guarantee
a
job
to
every
person
regardless
of
qualifications.
in
short,
the
act
does
command
that
any
person
be
hired
simply
because
he
was
formerly
the
subject
of
discrimination
or
because
he
is
a
member
a
minority
group.
discriminatory
preference
for
any
group,
minority
or
majority,
is
precisely
and
only
what
congress
has
prescribed.
what
is
required
by
congress
is
the
removal
of
artificial,
arbitrary
and
unnecessary
barriers
to
employment
when
the
barriers
operate
insidiously
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
racial
or
other
impermissible
classification
and
that
is
precisely
i
think,
your
honors
what
has
happened
here.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
this
court,
we
confidently
submit
our
case
to
you
for
your
consideration,
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
mr.
justice
douglas
and
may
it
please
the
court
your
honors.
there
are
still
basically
two
issues
presented
before
this
court
here
today
your
honors.
the
first
one
being
whether
or
not
the
1972
equal
employment
opportunity
act
repealed
the
1934
indian
preference
acts
by
implication
or
whether
that
tacitly
did
so.
the
second
question
i
think
that
is
presented
to
the
court
is
whether
or
not
the
indian
preference
acts
passed
some
40
years
ago,
i
am
talking
specifically
about
the
1934
act
your
honors,
is
violative
of
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
of
america.
now,
with
regard
to
the
statement
of
the
case
presented
to
you
here
this
afternoon,
your
honors
by
appellant,
i
would
like
to
bring
out
a
couple
of
factors
with
regard
to
bia
that
the
court
may
or
may
not
be
aware
of.
first
of
all,
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
your
honors,
has
a
dual
function
and
that
dual
functions
are
these.
number
one,
it
acts
as
a
trustee
for
certain
properties
for
the
indian
nations
and
secondly
it
provides
services
to
indians
through
other
federal
and
state
agencies.
now,
when
i
say
provide
services,
i
am
talking
about
such
things
as
school
construction,
maintenance
of
schools,
some
teachers,
providing
power
or
water
for
irrigation
or
for
lights.
there
are
some
health
services
that
are
put
through
hew
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
they
are
limited
to
indians,
yes,
your
honor,
but
they
are
services
rendered
to
indians.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
not
to
nobody
else
through
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
no,
your
honor
justice
white.
i
am
not
here
to
argue
that
point
with
regard
to
services
under
[voice
overlap].
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
and
that
they
will
promote
only
indians.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
no,
your
honor
i
don’t
and
for
this
reason,
justice
white,
i
think
that
it’s
clear
and
it
has
been
clear
that
congress’
power
with
regard
to
indians
is
almost
plenary.
they
have
treated
the
indians
as
a
subjugated
people
for
very
many,
many
years
and
that
their
powers
over
the
indian
nations
have
been
plenary
in
this
regard.
what
we
are
dealing
with
in
this
particular
case
are
government
employees
who
are
indian
members
of
the
bia
as
opposed
to
government
employees
in
the
bia
who
are
non-indians
and
this
court
and
the
congress
and
the
president
can
give
as
many
rights
as
they
want
to,
to
these
indians,
to
these
people.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
what
makes
this
illegal,
what
makes
this
particular
act
illegal
that
we
are
talking
about
and
making
it
unconstitutional
is
that
they
are
taking
away
from
other
government
employees
who
are
non-indians
to
give
the
indians
the
rights.
they
are
taking
the
rights
from
the
non-indian
employees
of
the
bia
to
give
the
rights
to
the
indian
employees
of
the
bia.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
everything
else
being
equal
if
he
is
qualified.
we
have
a
question
of
qualification
here
whether
or
not
the
indian
member
as
opposed
to
the
non-indian
member.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
not
so
long
as,
your
honor,
the
indian
is
qualified
and
can
pass
the
civil
service
examinations.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
oh,
yes
i
do.
yes,
your
honor,
in
that
regard.
[voice
overlap]
yes,
justice
white?
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
the
right
that
the
non-indian
employee
has
in
the
bia
is
his
right
to
his
job.
if
he
is
doing
a
good
job
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
if
they
are
applying
for
the
job
and
they
are
qualified
for
the
job
and
there
are
no
qualified
indians
available
for
the
job,
they
have
a
right
to
get
the
job.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
certainly
and
they
have
a
right
to
their
promotions
when
those
become
available
which
have
not
been
applied
as
far
as
the
way
this
act
is
presently
being
applied
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
your
honor
i
am
not
here
to
argue
the
matter
of
veteran’s
preferences
and
i
am
really
not
as
familiar
with
veteran’s
preferences
with
regard
to
these
kinds
of
acts.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
oh,
i
realize
that
they
exists
your
honor.
i
realize
that
they
exist.
the
point
that
i
am
trying
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
the
thing
that
makes
this
matter
unconstitutional,
justice
marshall,
is
not
so
much
giving
a
qualified
indian
job
over
a
qualified
non-indian,
but
when
they
are
both
already
employees
of
a
federal
agency
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
we
are
talking
here
in
this
case
your
honor
not
for
people
that
are
applying
for
the
job
but
promotions
within
the
agency
itself.
not
initial
hiring,
we
are
talking
about
promotions,
justice
marshall.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
if
the
qualifications
are
equal
your
honor.
from
a
practical
standpoint,
without
a
federal
statute,
probably,
the
indian
would
have
preference
over
the
non-indian
in
the
bia.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
no,
your
honor.
we
think
that
that’s
unconstitutional
as
well.
it’s
part
of
the
same
section
of
the
act
that
we’re
talking
about
here.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
no,
your
honor.
i
am
saying
that
the
indian
--
the
non-indian
employees
in
the
bia
who
are
employees
right
now
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
the
appellees
in
this
case
are
all
[voice
overlap].
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
what
we
are
talking
about
here
though,
your
honor,
in
deference
to
--
in
deference
to
what
your
first
problem
was
is
that
in
this
case
all
of
the
appellees
in
this
case
are
non-indian
employees
of
the
bia
right
now
and
they
have
been
denied
promotions
in
their
jobs.
they
have
been
denied
advancement
in
their
jobs
even
though
they
are
qualified
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
no
your
honor.
they
did
not
know
that
when
they
took
the
job.
that
is
the
reasons
that
we're
before
the
court
today.
what
makes
this
unconstitutional,
justice
marshall,
is
what
i
am
saying
is
they
can
have
all
of
the
rights
that
they
want,
all
of
the
privileges
that
they
want.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
1934
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor.
it
has
been
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
just
the
initial
hiring.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
not
as
to
promotion.
this
is
a
brand
new
thing
that
has
come
up,
justice
marshall
and
justice
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
that’s
true.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
i
don’t
know
whether
we
have
had
any
displaced
employees.
i
doubt
it,
justice
blackmun.
what
i
was
talking
about
are
qualified
non-indian
employees
not
being
promoted
and
not
being
advanced
within
the
bia
although
they
are
qualified
to
be
advanced.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
we
are
saying
that
the
entire
indian
preference
statute
that
was
passed
in
1934
is
no
longer
necessary
in
1974
and
that
it
is
in
fact
unconstitutional,
justice
rehnquist.
yes,
that
is
what
we
are
saying.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
no,
but
that
is
not
the
case
that
we
have
before
the
bar,
justice
rehnquist.
that’s
really,
the
problem
has
faced
--
facing
this
court
here
today.
now,
we
are
saying
in
the
first
instance
your
honors
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
justice
blackmun?
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
i
do
not
know
exactly
what
triggered
it
your
honor.
in
1972
or
shortly
thereafter,
it
became
a
policy
of
the
department
of
the
interior
and
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
to
advance
the
indian
employees
of
the
bia
over
the
non-indian
employees
of
the
bia
and
they
were,
as
we
maintain
here
today,
subsequently
discriminated
against
because
of
that
reason.
and
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
this
case
has
come
before
this
court
so
that
this
court
can
determine
whether
or
not
the
actions
taken
by
bia
at
that
time
are
in
fact
constitutional
or
unconstitutional.
with
regard
to
the
argument
about
the
1972
act
repealing
by
implication
the
1934
indian
preference
statute
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
point
out
this.
that
at
no
time,
at
no
time,
your
honors,
during
the
course
of
the
briefs
or
during
the
course
of
the
argument
that
we
have
heard
from
the
appellants,
do
the
appellants
at
all
deny
that
the
indian
employees
of
bia
are
government
employees
and
subject
to
the
rules
and
regulations
laid
down
in
the
statutes
that
we
are
talking
about
here
today.
there
has
been
no
objection
and
no
exception
either
in
the
court
below
or
before
this
court
that
they
are
government
employees.
now,
the
1964
equal
employment
opportunity
act,
which
apply
to
private
employers,
contained
an
exception
for
indians
living
on
or
near
a
reservation,
and
i
pointed
that
out
that
this
exception
was
made
for
those
businesses
or
enterprises
operating
on
or
near
a
reservation
with
a
publicly
announced
policy,
your
honors,
of
aiding
and
assisting
indians.
eight
years
later,
in
1972,
when
they
took
the
1964
act
and
applied
it
to
federal
employees,
there
is
no
exception
in
the
act
with
regard
to
bia
or
bia
employees,
none,
your
honors,
it
is
absolutely
absent.
in
the
briefs,
i
have
pointed
out
that
as
a
matter
of
congressional
record,
both
senator
bird
of
west
virginia
and
also
senator
humphrey
of
the
state
of
minnesota,
have
made
extensive
remarks
during
the
course
of
the
passage
of
the
1972
act
applying
to
all
federal
employees.
and
i
think
that
senator
bird’s
remarks
are
probably
even
more
apropos
here
than
in
any
other
time.
he
said,
“i
do
not
favor
special
treatment
or
special
consideration
or
favored
employment
of
any
individual
on
the
basis
of
that
person's
being
black
or
white
or
male
or
female.”
not
withstanding
what
i
have
just
said,
the
fact
remains
that
discrimination
in
employment
on
the
basis
of
race
does
exist
and
discrimination
against
sex
does
persist.
wherever
there
is
such
a
discrimination
in
employment,
it
is
violative
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
in
other
words,
he
should
rise
or
fall
on
the
basis
of
merit,
not
on
the
basis
of
his
race
or
religion
or
sex.
every
qualified
individual,
whether
he
be
black,
white
or
else,
should
be
given
an
equal
chance
and
not
preferential
treatment
in
an
employment.
we
would
also
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
section
105
of
title
v
of
the
united
states
code
specifically
lists
therein,
your
honors,
executive
department.
now,
executive
department
includes
the
department
of
the
interior
and
is
referred
to
and
included
in
section
717
of
the
1972
act.
now
if
congress
had
not
intended
to
refuse
to
make
an
exception
based
upon
race
in
government
employment,
why
would
they
include
it
in
the
definition.
in
other
words,
congress
did
not
intend
to
exclude
namely
indian
preference
that
which
they
specifically
included
in
the
act.
when
the
appellants
argue,
your
honors,
that
the
1972
act
is
a
general
statute
and
the
indian
preference
statutes
are
specific
legislation
and
that
therefore,
the
latter
should
be
upheld
in
resolving
conflicts,
i
think
we
are
talking
about
semantics.
they
both
cover
the
same
principle
that
we
are
talking
about
here,
your
honors.
they
both
cover
government
employment.
they
are
of
equal
import.
they
should
be
read
together
and
if
the
conflict
cannot
be
resolved
between
the
two,
then
the
most
recent
civil
rights
legislation
giving
us
freedom
from
discrimination
based
upon
sex,
race,
creed
or
color
is
the
one
that
should
be
upheld
and
not
vice
versa,
an
indian
preference
act
passed
40
years
ago,
when
the
situation
today
is
much
different.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
again,
your
honor,
this
is
an
act
of
congress
giving
the
opportunity
to
indian
young
men
and
women
to
become
educated
so
that
they
can
go
back
to
the
indian
schools
and
teach
the
indian-americans
what
life
is
like
outside
of
that
reservation;
that
non-indian
world
and
that
is
perfectly
alright.
we
are
not
talking
about
that
kind
of
an
action
being
unconstitutional,
but
i
fail
to
see
its
applicability
with
regard
to
our
first
argument,
the
1972
act
in
fact
impliedly
repealed
the
act
of
1934.
this
is
another
action
by
the
congress
of
the
united
states
to
give
to
the
indian-american
another
way
out
of
this
prison
that
he
has
been
put
in
by
virtue
of
this
indian
preference.
what
we
are
saying
to
these
people
are,
“you
are
american
citizens.
you
are
citizens
of
the
united
states
of
america.
however,
there
is
something
different
about
you
so
we
have
to
take
special
preferential
care
of
you”
and
i
think
that
is
what
we
wanted
to
do.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
considerable
information
in
the
record
with
regard
to
that.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
point
to
the
record
at
page
41
with
regard
to
the
employment
in
the
bia.
the
court
would
turn
to
page
41,
justice
marshall.
that
bia
data,
at
the
top
of
that
page,
indicates
who
are
the
majority
and
who
are
the
minority
employees
of
the
bia.
at
the
present
time,
within
the
bia,
there
are
8,347
indian
employees
and
7,176
non-indian
employees
or
a
total
of
15,523
human
beings
working
within
that
area.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
the
percentage
was
much
lower
as
was
counted
by
--
as
was
stipulated
by
a
counsel
in
his
opening
remarks
in
1930
and
between
1930
and
1934
there
were
very
few
indian
employees
in
what
was
then
called
the
indian
service.
but
the
indian
service
in
those
days
really
did
have
something
to
say
about
the
life
and
politics
of
indian
[voice
overlap].
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor.
they
are
better
off
than
they
were
in
1934;
much
better
off.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
[laughter]
i
think
so.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
justice
marshall,
recently
in
the
bureau
of
vital
statistics
of
the
united
states,
where
in
the
1940s,
i
think
the
average
age
of
the
indian-american
who
died
was
40.
it
is
now
something
like
68.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
[laughter
attempt]
repealed
it
by
implication.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
that
is
the
second
argument,
your
honor
and
i
am
going
to
get
to
that
very
shortly.
i
think
that
it
was
repealed
by
the
1972
equal
employment
opportunity
act
and
even
it
was
not,
it
is
still
an
unconstitutional
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
no,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor,
i
am
really
serious
that
i
think
that
it
repealed
it.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
[laughter]
that’s
true,
your
honor.
they
were
very,
very
specific
on
the
point.
as
part
of
the
jurisdictional
statements,
this
honorable
court
has
the
entire
opinion
of
the
court
below.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
they
were
convinced
that
it
was
repealed.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
no,
your
honor,
you
can’t.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
bia
today
is
in
a
state
of
upheaval.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
if
there
was
a
conflict
and
they
have
to
be
read
in
pari
materia
to
one
another
and
that
the
1972
act
being
the
more
recent,
civil
rights
legislation
repealed
the
1934
act.
that’s
exactly
the
point,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor;
justice
seth,
who
is
the
chief
justice
of
the
tenth
circuit
and
two
district
judges
from
albuquerque.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
that’s
correct,
justice
white
[laughter].
justice
seth
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor,
you
sure
can.
you
surely
can
sir.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
i
think
they
went
a
little
bit
further
than
that
your
honor.
but
this
is
a
question
of
an
interpretation
of
what
the
lower
court
held
and
certainly,
justice
marshall,
you
have
the
right
to
read
it
in
that
fashion.
with
regard
to
the
unconstitutional
aspect
of
the
1934
indian
preference
acts,
your
honor,
the
appellees
here
are
a
woman,
a
jewish
man,
a
mexican-american
and
a
black
american,
all
non-indian
employees
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
none
of
them
are
employed,
your
honors,
on
or
near
a
reservation,
none
of
them.
they
all
perform
technical
administerial
task
and
no
claim
has
ever
been
made
that
they
make
any
decisions
at
all
involving
indian
matters
or
participation
in
government.
for
that
matter,
your
honor,
our
point
in
the
brief
is,
is
that
the
bia
today
does
not
make
decisions
for
the
indian
tribes.
those
decisions
that
govern
their
everyday
lives
are
not
made
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
they
are
made
in
a
tribal
councils
on
the
reservations.
and
we
are
contending
that
the
indian
preference
acts
of
1934
discriminate
against
them
on
racial
basis
in
promotion
to
positions
that
are
likewise
not
on
or
near
a
reservation,
but
as
a
matter
of
practical
fact,
in
the
indian
polytechnical
school
in
albuquerque,
new
mexico
which
is
not
on
the
reservation.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
i
don’t
know
whether
the
secretary
of
the
interiors
ever
advised
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs.
there
are
some
things
in
this
brief,
justice
rehnquist,
that
indicate
that
perhaps
that
may
not
be
the
case.
i
think
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
mr.
rogers
c.b.
morton,
realizes
also
that
with
this
preference
act
that
we
have
now
applied,
that
the
non-indian
employees
of
the
bia
are
in
fact
second
class
citizens.
and
they
are
not
being
provided
with
their
constitutional
rights
in
having
their
jobs,
not
having
the
ability
to
be
advanced
in
their
jobs
and
promoted
in
their
jobs,
then
of
course
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
mr.
morton,
roger
c.b.
morton,
the
secretary
of
the
interior
is
one
of
the
appellants
your
honor.
amerind
inc.
is
the
--
an
indian
organization
for
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
he
is
the
--
one
of
the
appellants.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
i
think
he
does
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
[laughter]
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
i
do
not
think
they
are
in
agreement
on
this
one
neither
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
i
hope
so.
i
think
that
is
the
way
i
read
it
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
on
the
issue
of
as
to
whether
or
not
with
the
existence
of
the
indian
preference,
justice
stewart,
the
non-indian
employees
that
i
represent
are
in
fact
second
class
citizens
in
this
country.
because
of
the
--
their
inability
to
be
promoted,
their
inability
to
be
advanced
--
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
and
they
do
not
disagree
that
they
are
every
bit,
the
indian
employees
are
every
bit
as
much
governmental
employees
as
mine
on
indian
clients.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
i
think
so
your
honor.
you
see,
we
are
talking
about
two
different
things
here
with
indian
preference,
your
honor.

rehnquist,
if
i
could
just
take
a
moment
i
will
try
to
explain.
an
indian
is
defined
in
these
series
of
acts.
section
479
of
25
u.s.c.
defines
indians
for
the
purpose
of
this
indian
preference
as
follows.
an
indian
as
used
in
these
sections
including
indian
preference
shall
include
all
persons
of
indian
descent
who
are
members
of
any
recognized
indian
tribe
now
under
federal
jurisdiction.
and
all
persons
who
are
descendant
of
such
members
who
were
on
june
1,
1934
residing
within
the
present
boundaries
of
any
indian
reservation,
and
shall
further
include
all
other
persons
of
one-half
or
more
indian
blood.
when
we
are
talking
about
whether
or
not
an
indian
person
is
a
member
of
a
tribe,
some
tribes
require
a
blood
quantum,
some
do
not.
but
as
far
as
the
preference
acts
that
we
are
talking
about
here,
your
honor,
are
concerned,
they
have
to
have
--
they
are
supposed
to
have
one-half
or
more
indian
blood,
but
there
is
no
objection
and
there
is
no
argument
on
the
part
of
the
appellants
that
they
are
in
fact
applying
a
one-quarter
indian
blood
test
to
exercise
these
preferences.
and
i
don’t
believe
that
there
has
ever
been
argument
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
or
the
secretary
that
they
are
not
applying
that
basis.
now,
when
they
passed
this
act,
and
this
is
i
think
very,
very
interesting.
when
congress
passed
this
act
in
1934
giving
indians
preference,
they
said
in
section
478
of
title
25
u.s.c.,
sections
461,
462,
463,
464,
465,
466
through
470
and
471
through
473,
and
that
includes
the
indian
preference
because
472
is
the
indian
preference,
of
this
title
shall
not
apply
to
any
reservation
wherein
the
majority
of
the
adult
indians
voting
at
a
special
election
duly
called
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
shall
vote
against
its
application.
it
shall
be
the
duty
of
secretary
of
the
interior
within
one
year
after
june
18,
1934
to
call
such
an
election
which,
election
shall
be
held
by
secret
ballot
upon
thirty
days
notice.
that
election
was
held
your
honors
and
i
think
that
it
was
clearly
congress’
intent
that
section
472,
which
were
the
indian
preference
acts,
should
not
apply
to
any
reservation
where
the
male
members
of
the
tribe
voted
against
its
application.
as
a
matter
of
practical
fact,
the
largest
[attempt
to
laughter]
indian
reservation
in
the
united
states
today,
namely
the
navajo
reservation
that
come
from
where
i
come
from,
new
mexico
and
arizona,
voted
against
it.
and
the
tribal
operations
records
within
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
will
show
that
many
other
reservations
also
rejected,
chapter
576
in
total.
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
your
honor,
provides
in
part
that
citizens
of
the
united
states
shall
not
be
deprived
life,
liberty,
and
property
without
due
process
of
law.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
that
seems
to
me
to
have
been
the
intent
of
the
law.
now,
i
must
point
out
to
you
though,
justice
white,
that
in
the
lower
court,
they
took
a
different
view
of
that.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
the
preference
would
apply.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
these
preferences
were
granted
or
the
appellees
in
the
case
were
not
promoted
off
the
reservation
in
albuquerque
at
an
indian
school,
a
polytechnical
school
in
albuquerque,
new
mexico.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
probably,
your
honor.
justice
white,
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
the
section
is
--
that
the
section
was
in
there
as
part
of
the
indian
preference
act
to
see
whether
or
not
the
reservations
and
the
indians,
all
indians
of
one-half
blood
really
wanted
this
to
be
a
preference.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
that’s
true,
your
honor.
in
this
particular
case,
this
failure
to
promote
an
advance
qualified
personnel
happened
off
the
reservation,
in
the
city,
in
a
bia
run
school
for
indian
children.
mr.
gene
e.
franchini
the
case
of
the
board
of
county
commissioners
versus
seber
which
has
been
quoted
by
counsel
for
the
appellants,
appellees
do
not
feel,
decide
the
issue
or
the
issues
in
this
case.
that
case
decided
an
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
tax
exemption
statutes
were
violative
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
it
had
to
with
whether
or
not
the
rights
of
individual
indians
and
the
united
states
as
a
trustee
of
property
had
anything
to
do
with
the
taxation
part
of
the
matter.
it
did
not
involve
the
dispute
between
property
rights
of
indians
and
non-indians.
it
had
to
do
with
something
entirely
different
than
that.
the
other
case
that
is
cited
by
the
appellants
in
their
briefs
and
during
their
argument
i
think
your
honors,
none
go
to
the
point
in
issues
here.
there
are
the
points
in
issue
here.
it
is
a
proposition
and
a
stand
from
the
proposition
that
the
indians
have
a
different
and
probably
a
very
unique
position
with
regard
to
other
people
in
the
united
states
of
america,
but
it
does
not
decide
whether
or
not
you
can
deprive
a
government
employee
in
the
bia
advancement
in
his
position
when
he
is
qualified
because
of
an
indian
preference
act.
we
believe
that
that
is
contrary
to
the
fifth
amendment
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
it
is
a
distinction
based
upon
race.
we
are
talking
about
one
quarter
indian
blood.
when
we
start
talking
about
blood,
we
are
talking
about
race
here,
your
honors
and
i
think
that
that
is
clearly
the
issue
here.
that
this
is
strictly
a
racial
preference
and
this
is
strictly
a
preference
based
upon
race
and
nothing
more
or
less
than
that.
finally,
your
honors,
i
would
like
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
case
of
griggs
versus
duke
power
company
in
401
u.s.
424.
at
page
400
of
that
opinion,
the
chief
justice
who,
unfortunately
is
not
with
us
here
today,
wrote
an
opinion
and
part
of
that
opinion
i
think
is
very,
very
pertinent
here.
it
says
that
congress
did
not
intend
by
title
vii
however,
to
guarantee
a
job
to
every
person
regardless
of
qualifications.
in
short,
the
act
does
command
that
any
person
be
hired
simply
because
he
was
formerly
the
subject
of
discrimination
or
because
he
is
a
member
a
minority
group.
discriminatory
preference
for
any
group,
minority
or
majority,
is
precisely
and
only
what
congress
has
prescribed.
what
is
required
by
congress
is
the
removal
of
artificial,
arbitrary
and
unnecessary
barriers
to
employment
when
the
barriers
operate
insidiously
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
racial
or
other
impermissible
classification
and
that
is
precisely
i
think,
your
honors
what
has
happened
here.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
this
court,
we
confidently
submit
our
case
to
you
for
your
consideration,
mr.
justice
douglas.
