you

the

number

the

justice
william

well,
what
i
meant
was
the
total
number
of
employees
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
as
compared
to
the
total
number
of
the
indians?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
bureau,
mr.
sachse,
have
much
responsibility
outside
of
the
administration
of
tribal
affairs?
[voice

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
an
allottee,
if
he
meets
the
other
requirements
could
qualify
under
the
preference?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
isn’t
quite
as
simple,
as
if
they
had
a
preference
for
farmers
in
the
agriculture
department?
you
know
that
presumably
would
raise
very
few
equal
protection
arguments
and

i
don’t

justice
william
h.

do
you
think
you’ve
got
an
easier
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sterling,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
what
you
say
as
being
the
same
as
what
mr.
sachse
say
about
who
qualifies
for
the
preference.
if
you’re
not
on
a
reservation,
let’s
say
you’re
allottee,
but
you
do
trace
your
origins
back
to
a
federally
recognized
tribe,
do
you
qualify
for
the
preference?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
that
doesn’t
you
have
to
be
in
the
reservation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
franchini,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
the
government
not
to
apply
the
civil
service
rules
to
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
certainly
one
argument
i
assume
you
make
is
that
it’s
close
enough
to
a
distinction
based
on
race
or
color,
so
as
to
come
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
supposing
there
were
no
indian
preference
statute,
but
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
was
simply
exempt
it
from
the
civil
service
requirements
that
you
take
a
competitive
examination
to
get
in
although
most
other
government
departments
require
that
certain
examination.
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
with
that,
would
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
indian
education
act
that
was
passed
in
1972?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
secretary
of
the
interior
though
does
have
an
extraordinary
amount
of
authority
as
i
recall,
over
the
lives
of
individual
and
that
he
can
approve
wills,
he
can
approve
payments
of
tribal
attorney’s
fees
and
surely,
in
those
matters,
he
is
advised
by
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
isn’t
he?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
franchini,
i
do
not
know
if
the
united
states
still
has
mandate
authority
over
american
samoa
or
not,
but
it
did
it
one
time.
would
you
think
it
unconstitutional
for
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
governing
that
island
to
give
a
preference
in
local
employment,
preference
in
promotion
to
samoans?
