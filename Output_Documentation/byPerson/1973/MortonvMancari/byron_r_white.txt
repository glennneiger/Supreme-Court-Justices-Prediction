justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
think
about
600,000,
as
you
see
it,
who
are
entitled
to
the
preference
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
the
way
they’re
administering
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
[voice
overlap]
justice
byron
r.
white
the
statute
maybe
broader
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
whether
it
is
or
not
that
issue
isn’t
here,
i
guess.
justice
byron
r.
white
[voice
overlap]
those
preferences
are
all
limited
to
indians,
aren’t
they??
justice
byron
r.
white
but
to
nobody
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
you
suggest
there’s
also
a
constitutional
question
about
those
services?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
are
here
to
argue
that
the
constitutionality
of
a
preference
in
employment
for
indians
--
justice
byron
r.
white
a
preference
in
the
sense
that
they
will
hire
only
indians
for
certain
jobs?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
not
think
of
any
constitutional
question
about
furnishing
schools
only
to
indians
or
the
furnishing
water
or
a
lot
of
other
services
only
to
indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
anything
wrong
then,
if
there
is
a
vacancy
in
the
bia
then
there
are
two
applicants,
one
an
indian
and
one
a
non-indian,
to
give
the
job
to
the
indian?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
will
just
ask
you
again.
you
would
not
see
anything
wrong
of
giving
--
with
giving
the
preference
to
the
indian
in
every
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no.
so
you
do
see
something
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
rights
has
the
non-employee
got
that’s
being
taken
away
from
him
by
giving
preference
to
the
indians?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know
but
we
are
talking
about,
we
are
talking
about
vacancies.
about
non-employees
who
are
applying
for
employment,
what
rights
have
they
got
to
object
to
a
preference
given
to
an
indian?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
say
they
have
the
right
under
the
civil
service
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
point
about
the
vote,
therefore
this
preference
should
not
be
--
should
not
obtain
with
respect
to
employment
on
the
navajo
reservation
for
example?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
preference
is
granted
that
in
office
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
in
albuquerque
or
in
san
jose,
not
on
the
reservation.
let’s
assume
that
is
true.
the
exclusion
would
not
apply,
would
it?
i
mean
the
preference
would
apply.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
vote
on
the
reservation
would
be
irrelevant.
well,
where
are
these
preferences?
where
are
these
preferences
at
issue
in
this
case?
where
were
they
granted?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
the
vote
against
it
on
the
reservation
is
irrelevant?
justice
byron

(inaudible)
