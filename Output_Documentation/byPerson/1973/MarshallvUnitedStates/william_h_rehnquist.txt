if
defendant
is
given
treatment
under
title
ii,
if
he’s
eligible
for
it,
might
he
be
released
into
the
community
prior
to
the
probable
time
he
would
be
released
if
he
were
serving
a
present

justice
william

mr.
hewitt’s
argument
mrs.

equal
protection
that
is
that
he
was
not
claiming
a
violation
of
due

in
general
but
only
of

sharpe
type
of

well,

thought

i
thought
he
pretty
well

that
it’s
irrational
for
congress
to
say
that
just
because
you
have
two
felonies,
you
can’t
get
nara
treatment
under
title
ii
for
which
you
would
otherwise
be
eligible.
justice
