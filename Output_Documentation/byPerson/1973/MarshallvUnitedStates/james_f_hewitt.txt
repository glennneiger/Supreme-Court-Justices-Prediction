mr.
james
f.
hewitt
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
beg
the
court’s
indulgence
to
briefly
discuss
some
of
the
relevant
facts
to
put
this
case
in
its
proper
perspective.
approximately
four
years
ago,
robert
marshall
robbed
a
bank.
he
did
not
use
a
gun
and
he
did
this
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
money
to
buy
heroine
for
his
narcotics
addiction.
he
was
arrested
and
prosecuted
for
bank
robbery.
it
appears
that
he
had
two
or
rather
three
prior
felony
convictions
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
california.
and
about
that
time,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
en
banc
decided
the
watson
case
holding
the
two
prior
felony
exclusion
unconstitutional
under
the
due
process
clause
as
denying
equal
protections
to
a
narcotic
addict
under
title
ii.
and
a
request
was
made
to
the
united
states
attorney
in
the
light
of
mr.
marshall’s
obvious
addiction
to
charge
him
with
a
crime
not
one
of
violence,
so
that
at
least
he
could
invoke
in
the
district
court,
the
watson’s
decision.
that
was
done.
marshall
was
charged
with
entering
a
bank
with
intent
to
commit
larceny
while
it
carries
the
same
penalty
as
armed
bank
robbery,
it
is
not
robbery
under
the
statute,
and
therefore,
he
was
not
barred
by
that
provision
of
the
narcotics
act.
marshall
pleaded
guilty
and
submitted
to
the
district
court
that
he
should
be
eligible
for
consideration
under
title
ii
for
prison
commitment
as
a
narcotic
addict
and
for
treatment
and
that
the
two
prior
felony
exclusion
was
on
unconstitutional
discriminatory
classification.
the
judge
felt
that
--
the
prior
judge
felt
that
this
was
not
the
law
in
the
ninth
circuit.
he
declined
to
follow
the
watson’s
decision
and
sentenced
marshall
to
10
years
under
18
u.s.c.
4208
(a)
(2)
providing
for
parole
at
anytime,
the
same
maximum
sentence
for
which
he
could
be
held
under
title
ii
commitment
10
years,
recommended
in
his
commitment
that
he
be
given
treatment
for
his
narcotics
addiction
in
federal
prison.
marshall
had
received
no
treatment
to
date.
i
talked
to
his
case
worker
before
leaving
san
francisco
on
friday.
it
was
determined
at
the
time
to
wait
until
a
little
later
and
see
what
had
developed
with
respect
to
this
particular
line
of
authority
and
marshall
filed
a
2255
application
i
felt
prematurely
because
i
was
waiting
for
some
other
decisions
to
come
down,
but
at
the
time
his
2255
petition
was
heard
by
the
district
court,
watson
was
the
only
significant
case
still
on
the
books
and
judge
peckham
following
that
decision,
declined
to
set
aside
the
conviction
on
the
grounds
that
the
discriminatory
classification
prevented
him
from
committing
him
under
the
title
ii
of
narcotics
act.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
with
the
district
court
that
the
classification
was
not
an
arbitrary
one.
in
the
interim,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
had
decided
hamilton
which
clarified
the
situation
by
pointing
out
that
any
two
prior
felony
convictions
whether
narcotic
related
or
not,
would
be
discriminatory
classification
and
then
while
the
petition
for
cert
was
before
this
court,
the
first
circuit
followed
the
watson
decision
and
hamilton
decision
and
held
the
discriminatory
classification
a
violation
of
due
process
by
denying
equal
protections.
so
we
have
at
the
present
time
the
first
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit's
holding
that
statute
unconstitutional
as
it
improperly
discriminates,
the
fifth
and
ninth
circuit
holding
that
the
classification
is
a
reasonable
one.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
knew
that
one
of
your
honors
would
ask
that
question.
i’d
like
to
say,
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
trend
of
cases
after
jackson
versus
indiana
and
a
number
of
district
court
cases,
some
of
which
were
cited
by
this
court
in
jackson,
perhaps
are
leading
to
a
conclusion
that
treatment
for
an
ill
person
and
if
we
assume
the
premise
that
a
drug
addict
is
an
ill
person,
it
may
very
well
be
a
fundamental
interest
that
the
state
or
the
government
must
provide.
i
would
use
an
example
of
it.
if
we
are
going
to
commit
a
prisoner
to
the
medical
center
at
springfield
as
mentally
ill,
i
don’t
think
he
can
be
sent
there
and
then
not
treated
for
his
mental
illness.
and
i
certainly
don’t
think
that
you
can
deprive
him
of
treatment
for
his
mental
illness
on
the
grounds
that
he
might
have
a
bad
criminal
record.
i
would
like
to
say
that
this
is
a
fundamental
interest
that
we’re
talking
about,
but
i
realize
that
the
court
has
not
gone
that
far
and
i
would
have
to
say
that
perhaps,
we’re
talking
about
an
interest
more
in
the
social
welfare
economic
realm
than
in
a
fundamental
interest
area.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
oh
no!
no.
in
fact,
the
crux
of
our
argument
is
this.
we
say
marshall
had
a
right
to
be
considered
by
the
district
court.
now,
if
the
district
court
looked
at
his
record
and
said,
well,
he’s
a
dangerous
person.
his
crimes
of
violence
are
recent.
he
has
crimes
of
violence.
he
has
a
violent
background.
he’s
not
likely
to
respond
the
treatment.
the
district
court
can
exercise
its
discretion
and
not
commit
him
under
title
ii,
but
marshall
never
got
that
chance.
and
he
never
got
the
chance
because
the
two
prior
felony
exclusion
in
title
ii
operates
as
a
conclusive
presumption
that
he
is
not
likely
to
be
rehabilitated
and
that
is
the
irrational
classification
of
which
we
complain.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
you,
your
honor
--[voice
overlap]
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
we’re
talking
in
the
narcotics
rehabilitation
act
about
two
titles.
title
i
is
the
civil
commitment
in
lieu
of
prosecution
and
the
thrust
of
the
legislative
history
aimed
towards
this
title
i
is
talking
about
escaping
punishment
and
so
forth.
and
i
certainly
have
no
quarrel
with
these
classifications
as
they
may
relate
to
title
i.
but
title
ii
is
a
prison
type
commitment.
it
is
a
commitment
to
a
federal
prison
where
the
drug
rehabilitation
program
is
made
available
within
a
prison
sentence.
he
is
under
the
supervision
on
after
care
of
the
board
of
paroles
as
any
other
prisoner
and
he
is
certainly
is
not
in
any
sense
of
the
word
escaping
punishment,
if
punishment
is
a
valid
objective.
so,
there
are
distinct
differences
between
title
i
and
ii.
the
felony
convictions
that
title
two
talks
about,
and
of
course
the
debarring
of
provisions
apply
to
title
i
with
equal
force,
need
not
be
violent
felonies.
they
need
not
be
current.
they
could
have
been
20
years
ago.
they
could
have
been
two
convictions,
one
for
mail
theft
and
one
for
forgery.
there’s
no
showing
that
--
no
necessity
that
they
even
had
been
drug-related.
they
may
be
in
one
jurisdiction
misdemeanors
and
then
another
jurisdiction
felonies.
they
may
be
subject
to
expungement
in
california,
but
perhaps
not
subject
to
expungement
in
the
district
of
columbia
since
there’s
no
provision
in
our
federal
court
for
expunging
a
criminal
record.
if
it’s
expunged,
it
doesn’t
count.
so,
it’s
obvious
that
the
two
prior
felony
provision
is
arbitrary
even
as
it’s
applied.
now,
the
question
that
we
would
like
this
court
to
consider
is
whether
or
not,
that
classification
of
two
prior
felonies
is
reasonably
related
to
affect
the
legislative
purpose
of
the
narcotic
addict
rehabilitation
act
and
we
submit
to
the
court
that
it
is
not.
there
absolutely
is
no
rational
connection
between
two
prior
felony
convictions
and
whether
or
not
the
addict
needs
treatment.
and
i
think
a
common
sense
approach
shows
that
it
operates
in
effect
as
a
conclusive
presumption
without
a
rational
nexus.
i
think
if
we
ask
the
man
on
the
street
a
very
common
sense
series
of
questions;
what
do
you
think
of
the
fact
that
perhaps
50%
of
the
drug
addicts
or
50%
of
the
street
crimes
are
committed
by
drug
addicts.
he
would
probably
say,
“i
agree
with
you.
that
is
probably
correct.”
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
that’s
right.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
at
the
present
time,
he
is
simply
not
committed
under
the
narcotic
addict
rehabilitation
act.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
oh
no,
your
honor.
if
he
is
in
an
institution
that
has
a
drug
program,
and
if
he
is
within
a
year
or
year-and-a-half
of
parole,
they
may
put
him
into
a
drug
program,
but
it’s
discretionary
with
the
prison
officials.
our
point
is
that
he
should
have
an
opportunity
as
any
other
member
of
the
class
could
be
considered
by
the
district
court
for
commitment
as
a
drug
addict,
where
he
is
guaranteed
drug
rehabilitative
treatment.
now
i’m
not
qualified
to
discuss
whether
or
not,
treatment
at
the
end
are
the
parole
period
is
better
or
worse
than
treatment
at
the
beginning
of
the
prison
period.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
a
person
whose
antisocial
behavior
is
the
product
of
drug
addiction
would
be
better
off
to
get
into
a
prison
program
that’s
oriented
to
drug
rehabilitation
from
the
beginning,
so
that
the
whole
rehabilitation
program
can
be
key
to
the
root
cause
of
the
problem
which
would
be
held
on
addiction
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
and
it
does,
i
think,
when
the
classification
of
having
been
convicted
of
two
prior
felonies,
bars
him
from
consideration
with
other
members
of
the
class
similarly
situated
because
it’s
our
position
and
the
position
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
the
first
circuit
that
there’s
just
no
rational
relationship
between
two
prior
felonies
and
likelihood
to
be
rehabilitated
which
is
the
prime
purpose
of
the
narcotic
rehabilitation
act.
now,
the
government
seems
to
justify
this
classification
on
the
basis
that
there’s
an
effort
to
limit
resources
available
toward
the
program.
now,
there
are
some
comments
in
the
legislative
history
concerning
available
resources
and
i
think
the
care
for
the
perusal
of
the
legislative
history
will
show
that
most
of
the
congressmen
and
senators
were
talking
about
title
i
and
the
facilities
that
might
have
to
be
built
under
the
public
health
service
in
order
to
handle
the
intake
that
would
be
created
by
opening
title
i,
the
commitment
in
lower
prosecution.
title
ii,
however,
or
commitments
to
the
federal
prisons
ostensibly
at
least,
the
convicted
prisoner
and
it’s
almost
always
a
felony
that
convicted
felon
will
go
to
a
federal
prison
anyhow.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
in
title
he
is
committed
to
go
the
surgeon
general.
they’re
not
committed
to
prison.
they’re
not
sentenced.
it’s
not
a
sentencing
provision.
that’s
the
commitment
in
lieu
of
prosecution.
that
was
the
area,
i
think
where
the
legislative
history
indicates
there
may
have
been
some
concern
about
available
resources,
certainly
not
as
to
title
ii.
no
prisons
had
to
be
built,
because
the
person
is
going
to
be
imprisoned
anyhow.
it’s
just
a
question
of
whether
or
not,
while
in
prison
he’s
going
to
get
drug
rehabilitation
treatment
or
whether
he’s
going
to
get
straight
prison
treatment.
there
may
or
may
not
be
drug-oriented
depending
upon
the
whim
of
the
prison
at
a
particular
time.
the
government
seeks
to
justify
on
the
grounds
that
available
resources
is
a
secondary
purpose
and
i
don’t
think
the
legislative
history
supports
it.
the
statute
hasn’t
built
an
escape
provision.
if
at
any
time,
the
attorney
general
finds
that
facilities
are
not
available
or
limited,
he
may
certify
and
not
take
any
drug
addicts
into
the
title
ii
program.
so,
the
availability
of
funds
is
always
subject
to
this
escape
valve
built
into
the
statute.
if
the
rationale
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
thanks,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
were
discussing
yesterday
it
was
our
position
as
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
held
in
hamilton
that
the
two
prior
felony
exclusion
operates
in
effect
as
a
conclusive
presumption
of
an
eligibility
and
that
the
rational
connection
between
two
prior
felony
convictions.
with
no
delineation
as
to
the
type
of
conviction,
the
time
of
conviction
or
other
circumstances
in
effect
would
deprive
an
applicant
who
would
be
otherwise
eligible
for
commitment
under
the
present
provisions
of
title
ii
from
an
opportunity
to
have
consideration
and
a
hearing.
now,
this
court
last
term
in
the
food
stamp
cases,
the
department
of
agriculture
versus
moreno
in
effect
struck
down
a
provision
similar
to
that
which
operated
as
a
conclusive
presumption
thereby
preventing
a
fair
hearing
of
the
merits,
a
person’s
eligibility.
i
would
submit
to
you
your
honors
that
that
would
be
basically
the
same
problem
here.
this
in
effect
fetters
the
hand
of
the
trial
judge
and
prevents
him
from
an
opportunity
to
fairly
evaluate
whether
or
not
the
particular
addict
should
be
sent
to
prison
for
addict
treatment
or
whether
he
should
be
sent
as
a
straight
offender
and
subject
to
whatever
rehabilitative
treatment
might
be
available.
we
feel
that
the
trial
judge’s
hand
should
be
unfettered.
that
this
constitutional
--
this
congressional
classification
is
in
effect
an
irrational
one
and
defeats
the
legislative
purpose
of
the
act.
it
would
appear
to
us
that
the
addict
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
marshall
did
have
in
effect
almost
a
fundamental
right
to
consideration
for
fair
and
effective
treatment
of
his
addiction.
as
we
pointed
out
yesterday,
we’re
not
talking
about
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no,
your
honor.
but
he
certainly
had
a
right
to
have
the
judge
consider
that
and
in
the
exercise
of
a
sound
judicial
discretion
determine
that
this
is
the
type
of
addict
who
was
likely
to
be
rehabilitated
and
who
may
have
treatment.
the
problem
here
is
that
the
judge
couldn’t
do
this
under
the
statute.
he
was
barred.
he
was
in
effect
prevented
from
even
an
opportunity
of
considering
this
man’s
background.
now,
it
may
well
be
that
the
congress
has
decided
to
keep
hiding
criminals
out
of
title
ii,
but
the
judge
can
do
that.
he
can
do
that
by
just
simply
not
exercising
his
sound
discretion
and
committing
him
under
title
ii
of
the
narcotics
act.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
think
certainly
congress
could
limit
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
and
provide
that
no
addict
could
be
committed
for
treatment.
but
where
it
has
created
a
class
and
a
class
to
which
mr.
marshall
is
a
member
and
then
excluded
him
from
the
class
on
the
basis
of
an
irrational
classification.
it
was
our
position
that
he
has
been
deprived
the
due
process
by
virtue
of
denial
of
equal
protections.
i
would
have
to
concede
that
congress
doesn’t
have
to
give
addict
treatment
to
addicts.
it
can
limit
the
course
of
jurisdiction
in
the
area
of
consideration
but
it
certainly
cannot
prevent,
marshall
the
petitioner
here,
from
consideration
on
the
basis
of
this
irrational
classification.
now,
the
government
seeks
to
justify
this
by
the
expedient
explanation
of
possible
subsidiary
purpose
in
the
legislation
to
conserve
economic
resources.
they
could’ve
made
that
argument
in
the
department
of
agriculture
food
stamp
cases
that
they
wanted
to
limit
the
number
of
people
eligible
for
food
stamps
to
save
money
and
thereby
justify
the
classification
but
it
wouldn’t
be
any
more
justified
in
that
particular
case
than
it
would
be
here.
most
of
the
legislative
history
that
the
government
has
cited
relates
to
some
apprehensions
that
congress
had
in
connection
with
expanding
the
existing
public
health
facilities
for
the
title
i,
the
prosecution
in
lieu
of
the
commitment
in
law
of
prosecution
provision
for
title
iii
of
the
voluntary
commitment
provision.
it
would
appear
from
the
examination
of
the
legislative
history
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
was
not
too
concerned
with
any
drain
upon
their
resources.
they
have
the
prisons,
the
person
who
is
going
to
go
to
prison,
it's
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he’s
going
to
go
and
get
addict
treatment
or
whether
he’s
going
to
go
and
in
effect
be
deprived
of
addict
treatment
or
get
it
only
at
the
whim
of
the
bureau
of
prisons.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
they
do
if
they
have
a
test
that
--
that
is
fair
and
certainly
a
test
that
is
not
based
upon
a
conclusive
presumption
of
being
a
hardened
criminal
simply
by
virtue
of
two
prior
felony
convictions.
what
we
object
to
is
the
fact
that
these
two
prior
felonies
could
have
been
30
years
ago.
they
could
have
been
for
the
most
innocuous
of
offenses
and
to
say
that
a
person
is
a
hardened
criminal
because
30
years
ago
he
was
convicted
of
theft
of
mail
or
forgery
of
a
treasury
check
to
relatively
innocuous
felonies.
to
say
that
he
is
a
hardened
criminal
and
therefore
he
is
not
eligible
to
treatment
in
prison
as
an
addict,
i
think
is
just
certainly
irrational
and
this
is
our
objection.
if
there
are
standards
applied
to
the
barring
provision
reasonably
related
to
the
purpose
of
the
legislation,
perhaps
our
position
would
not
be
quite
so
strong
but
i
feel
here
that
what
we
had
basically
is
a
recognition
that
narcotic
addiction
is
the
root
cause
of
a
good
deal
of
crime.
there
is
an
effort
on
the
part
of
congress
to
treat
addicts
by
giving
them
treatment
in
prison.
and
then
to
say
that
these
objectives
will
be
fulfilled
by
barring
from
that
very
treatment
those
with
criminal
records
is
an
irrational
conclusion.
in
fact,
it’s
almost
absurd
and
that
is
certainly
our
position
in
this
case.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
if
i
may
respond
to
some
of
the
solicitor
general’s
suggestions,
the
references
in
the
legislative
history
to
pilot
an
experimental,
i
think
were
aimed
directly,
for
the
most
part,
at
titles
i
and
iii.
the
concept
of
having
civil
commitment
in
lieu
of
prosecutions
or
a
voluntary
commitment
for
addicts
was
a
new
concept.
we
never
had
it
before.
but
during
the
legislative
history
they
discussed
the
experiences
in
new
york
and
california
with
this
type
of
commitment
and
i
certainly
don’t
think
there’s
anything
new
or
anything
novel
or
experimental
about
giving
the
best
treatment
that
the
prison
system
can
to
an
addict
who
is
imprisoned.
i
don’t
think,
certainly,
we
can
say
that
this
with
any
great
well
change.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no,
your
honor.
and
this
is
the
fallacy
of
the
government’s
argument.
at
the
present
time,
the
reason
that
the
addicts
are
being
released
in
approximately
18
months
after
they’re
committed
under
title
ii
is
that
the
only
addicts
in
prison
are
checks
towards
male
thieves.
no
one
with
any
prior
records
there,
no
one
with
a
crime
of
violence
is
there.
these
are
fairly
moderate
sentences
that
are
being
given.
probably
five
years
or
less
since
title
ii
provides
that
he
cannot
be
sentenced
in
excess
of
the
maximum
that
could
be
imposed.
we’re
not
talking
about
bank
robbers
or
kidnappers
or
people
who
engaged
in
violent
crimes.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
don’t
know
where
that
conclusion
comes
from.
it
certainly
not
my
experience
and
i’ve
been
in
the
criminal
justice
assistant
for
13
years.
it
depends
upon
the
individual.
it
depends
upon
his
propensities
other
than
addiction.
i
have
found
from
my
experience
that
the
older
addict
with
a
longer
criminal
record
is
more
amenable
to
rehabilitation
than
the
young
kid
who
is
just
getting
started.
he
doesn’t
have
the
maturity
and
the
experience
of
the
older
person.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
would
certainly
agree
that
it's
a
problem
but
i
hope
we
have
come
a
long
way
since
1896
in
penal
reform.
i
certainly
hope
that
we
are
doing
something
for
addicts
in
prison.
what
i
can
assure
you,
your
honors
that
addicts
sentenced
to
federal
prisons
do
not
get
treatment
unless
they
are
in
a
nara
program
or
unless
they
are
one
and
one
of
the
prisoners
that
has
a
program
with
openings,
and
there
are
only
12
of
those
i
understand
out
of
28.
and
two,
they
are
one
year
or
18
months
away
from
parole.
edward
marshall
was
sentenced
by
the
district
judge
to
10
years
parole
at
any
time
and
a
specific
recommendation
in
the
judgment
that
he
would
be
given
treatments
for
his
addiction
and
he
isn’t
getting
it,
simply
because
of
his
prior
felony
record.
he’s
not
getting
any
treatment
and
he’s
an
addict
in
prison.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
that
is
my
understanding.
twelve
federal
prisons
that
have
available
addict
facilities
out
of
28.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i’m
not
sure
that
all
of
them
have
available
facilities
for
title
ii
but
they
do
have
some
type
of
drug
treatment
program
in
existence.
and
i
think
it’s
fairly
well
conceded
and
the
government’s
response
to
my
memorandum
in
response
to
their
memorandum,
in
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
that
where
they
point
out
that
there
only
so
many
institution
and
that
addicts
do
not
get
treatment
on
a
straight
sentence
until
the
end
of
their
term
and
only
if
they’re
in
an
institution
where
such
treatment
is
available.
whether
this
is
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
treatment
keyed
as
contemplated
by
title
ii
of
the
act.
two,
addiction
is
the
root
cause
of
the
person's
antisocial
conduct.
what
the
medical
differences
are,
i’m
not
qualified
to
say.
there
must
be
a
different
treatment
otherwise
congress
would
not
have
to
pass
title
ii
but
at
least
under
title
two
and
i
would
point
out
to
your
honors,
that’s
not
a
civil
commitment.
the
statute
itself,
the
phraseology
of
title
ii
says,
“commitment
for
treatment
is
a
commitment
to
prison.”
the
civil
commitment
is
titles
i
and
iii,
it’s
keyed
to
psychiatric,
psychological
treatment
to
testing
and
two
various
type
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
not
at
all.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
don’t
know.
i
don’t
know
what
available
treatment
they
have
for
persons
serving
regular
sentences.
fort
worth
used
to
be
a
public
health
facility
and
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
problem
or
question,
lexington
is
a
public
health
facility
and
to
my
knowledge,
that
there
maybe
a
few
prisoners
serving
sentences
that
are
put
there
for
administrative
reasons,
it
is
a
public
health
facility
and
i
understand
title
i
--
the
east
coast
toward
lexington.
we
use
to
send
title
i’s
in
the
west
coast
to
forth
worth
when
it
was
a
public
health
facility
but
several
years
ago,
when
forth
worth
was
transferred
to
the
bureau
of
prisons,
california
contract
was
made
with
catholic
charities
in
san
diego
for
the
commitment
of
title
i
addicts.
and
i’m
frank
to
admit
that
our
judges
were
not
so
anxious
to
use
title
i
to
send
them
to
san
diego
to
an
outpatient
type
program.
they
haven’t
use
it
nearly
as
much
as
we
used
to
it.
now,
the
judges
will
prefer
using
title
ii,
the
prison
type
commitment.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no,
you
honor.
he
probably
be
on
terminal
island.
i
don’t
believe
there’s
a
nara
program
at
mcneal.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
wouldn’t
be
here
arguing
it
because
he
wouldn’t
have
a
constitutional
right
to
fair
treatment
being
a
member
of
a
class
just
being
discriminated
against
by
this
classification.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
and
by
some
prison
regulation
he
is
being
deprived
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
well,
i
think
those
are
more
reasonable,
more
reasonable
problems
that
they
might
having
connection
with
who
gets
into
a
program
by
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
bureau
of
prison
or
by
the
prison
authorities.
it
may
well
be
that
the
congress
had
vested
with
them
the
discretionary
power
to
decide
who
is
going
to
be
in
a
program
and
who
isn’t
on
some
quantitative
basis,we
have
a
different
problem
but
here
marshall
is
kept
out
not
on
the
basis
of
any
rational
determination
by
the
court.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
he
is
out
of
it
only
because
of
this
conclusion,
this
conclusive
presumption
that
he
is
a
dangerous,
vicious
criminal
on
a
basis
of
two
prior
criminal
--
two
prior
felony
convictions.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
as
i
read
the
legislative
history,
your
honor,
most
of
the
comments
were
concerning
civil
commitments
under
the
title
i
and
ii
as
being
a
novel
approach
to
the
problem.
and
that
most
of
the
conversation
was
in
connection
with
this
being
something
new
to
defer
prosecution
and
to
permit
an
offender
to
go
into
a
hospital
rather
than
to
be
prosecuted.
i
don’t
think
that
this
it
is
novel
to
put
into
the
prison
system,
a
narcotic
treatment
program
for
addicts.
and
this
wasn’t
that
revolutionary.
title
i
was
a
different
prosecution,
an
election
by
the
offenders
is
new.
it
was
novel
and
it
was
experimental.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
certainly
not
to
the
extent.
i
think
recent
legislation
has
opened
up
the
areas
of
providing
treatment
for
addicts.
of
course,
i
would
hope
that
the
prisons
are
trying
to
teach
the
root
cause
of
every
prisoner’s
problem.
if
it
would
be
addiction,
i
would
hope
they
will
give
him
some
kind
of
treatment.
here,
i
don’t
know
what
the
differences
are.
they’re
more
technical.
but
protection
of
society,
i
would
urge
upon
the
court,
is
not
the
objectives
of
the
narcotic
addict
rehabilitation
act.
it
maybe
a
noble
legislative
purpose
in
other
areas
but
i
don’t
think
that
the
solicitor
general
can
rely
upon
protection
of
society
to
justify
this
classification.
the
clear
purpose
of
the
narcotic
rehabilitation
act
is
to
rehabilitate
eligible
addicts
and
protection
of
the
society
simply
has
no
part
in
that
legislative
scheme.
we
concede
that
excluding
convicted
felons
may
protect
society
but
certainly
it
doesn’t
further
for
the
purposes
of
this
statute
which
is
to
rehabilitate
addicts
charged
with
an
offense.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
is
this
ultimate
purpose
of
protecting
society
by
eliminating
the
addiction.
but
i
don’t
think
the
purpose
of
this
statute
can
be
in
any
sense
of
the
word
be
to
protect
society
by
keeping
convicted
offenders
out
of
the
program
except
indirectly
by
perhaps
trying
to
rehabilitate
more
offenders.
what
we’re
talking
about
here
basically
is
a
scheme,
thus
designed
to
accomplish
a
certain
objective
and
irrational
classification
that
i
think
rather
than
furthering
the
objective
certainly
defeats
a
good
portion
of
it.
we
were
taking
the
position
that
this
is
almost
a
conclusive
presumption
that
prevents
the
trial
judge
from
exercising
his
discretion.
it
may
well
be
that
marshall
could
be
determined
by
the
trial
judge
not
suitable
for
treatment.
upon
an
examination
of
his
background,
the
judge
might
determine
that
the
felonies,
prior
felonies
were
not
drug
related.
they
were
violent
felonies
and
show
him
to
be
bad
man
and
not
give
him
the
treatment.
but
he
isn’t
escaping
punishment
if
he’s
committed
to
prison
for
addict
treatment.
he
could
be
kept
up
to
10
years
when
his
parole
was
within
the
discretion
of
the
board,
i’m
sure
they
are
not
going
to
let
him
out
until
he’s
ready
to
go
on
the
street.
he
goes
into
a
board
of
parole
supervised
after
care
program.
he’s
certainly
not
escaping
punishment
.those
policies
in
the
legislative
history
are
aimed
more
at
title
i
and
there’s
a
great
deal
of
confusion
about
conservation
of
available
resources
and
so
forth.
civil
commitment
is
the
terms
that
was
thrown
about.
this
is
not
a
civil
commitment.
it’s
a
penal
commitment
and
this
is
not
a
novel
program.
it
is
a
change
in
a
concept
of
penal
reform.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
it
certainly
does,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
some
offenses,
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
purpose
of
that
statute
is
to
impose
a
harsh
punishment
on
certain
types
of
offenders,
in
that
case
drug
pushers
is
reasonably
related
to
that
purpose.
the
punishment
--
here
the
object
is
not
punishment,
it’s
simply
rehabilitation
and
this
exclusion
does
not
accomplish
that
purpose.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
if
that’s
the
purpose,
your
honor,
then
the
classification
should
be
set
aside
because
it
is
not
reasonably
related
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
punishment
is
not
the
purpose.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
there’s
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
stated
purpose
that
would
indicate
there
was
any
desire.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
in
order
to
punish
them?
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
well,
i
think
it
is
certainly
beyond
the
stated
purpose
of
the
statute.
there’s
nothing
to
support
any
intention
upon
congress
to
punish
addicts
because
of
a
prior
criminal
record.
certainly,
they
are
being
punished
by
being
deprived
of
addict
treatment
that
other
similarly
situation
would
be
entitled
to.
but
i
certainly
don’t
think
that
this
furthers
any
legitimate
legislative
objective.
so,
this
is
not
a
penal
statute
imposing
punishment
for
any
offense.
he’s
being
punished
indirectly.
everyone
who
is
deprived
of
a
constitutional
right
is
being
punished
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
don’t
think
it
has
any
purpose,
your
honor.
that’s
why
we
are
here
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
they
say
the
purpose
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
conserve
available
resources.
to
limit
the
--
[voice
overlap]
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
they
can
only
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
but
that
cannot
be
justified
when
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
the
rehabilitation
of
offenders
because
there’s
no
rational
relationship
between
punishment
and
the
context
of
this
statute
and
rehabilitation
of
narcotic
addicts.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
but
for
that
exclusion
he
would
be,
your
honor.
he
would
be
a
member
of
an
eligible
class
but
for
the
prior
felonies.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
your
honor
and
i’d
say
that
this
is
not
reasonable
as
the
government
says
it
is
because
it’s
related
to
a
legitimate
purpose
of
the
statute
and
that
it
conserves
available
resources
and
it’s
our
position
that
that’s
not
sufficient.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
beg
the
court’s
indulgence
to
briefly
discuss
some
of
the
relevant
facts
to
put
this
case
in
its
proper
perspective.
approximately
four
years
ago,
robert
marshall
robbed
a
bank.
he
did
not
use
a
gun
and
he
did
this
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
money
to
buy
heroine
for
his
narcotics
addiction.
he
was
arrested
and
prosecuted
for
bank
robbery.
it
appears
that
he
had
two
or
rather
three
prior
felony
convictions
in
the
courts
of
the
state
of
california.
and
about
that
time,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
en
banc
decided
the
watson
case
holding
the
two
prior
felony
exclusion
unconstitutional
under
the
due
process
clause
as
denying
equal
protections
to
a
narcotic
addict
under
title
ii.
and
a
request
was
made
to
the
united
states
attorney
in
the
light
of
mr.
marshall’s
obvious
addiction
to
charge
him
with
a
crime
not
one
of
violence,
so
that
at
least
he
could
invoke
in
the
district
court,
the
watson’s
decision.
that
was
done.
marshall
was
charged
with
entering
a
bank
with
intent
to
commit
larceny
while
it
carries
the
same
penalty
as
armed
bank
robbery,
it
is
not
robbery
under
the
statute,
and
therefore,
he
was
not
barred
by
that
provision
of
the
narcotics
act.
marshall
pleaded
guilty
and
submitted
to
the
district
court
that
he
should
be
eligible
for
consideration
under
title
ii
for
prison
commitment
as
a
narcotic
addict
and
for
treatment
and
that
the
two
prior
felony
exclusion
was
on
unconstitutional
discriminatory
classification.
the
judge
felt
that
--
the
prior
judge
felt
that
this
was
not
the
law
in
the
ninth
circuit.
he
declined
to
follow
the
watson’s
decision
and
sentenced
marshall
to
10
years
under
18
u.s.c.
4208
(a)
(2)
providing
for
parole
at
anytime,
the
same
maximum
sentence
for
which
he
could
be
held
under
title
ii
commitment
10
years,
recommended
in
his
commitment
that
he
be
given
treatment
for
his
narcotics
addiction
in
federal
prison.
marshall
had
received
no
treatment
to
date.
i
talked
to
his
case
worker
before
leaving
san
francisco
on
friday.
it
was
determined
at
the
time
to
wait
until
a
little
later
and
see
what
had
developed
with
respect
to
this
particular
line
of
authority
and
marshall
filed
a
2255
application
i
felt
prematurely
because
i
was
waiting
for
some
other
decisions
to
come
down,
but
at
the
time
his
2255
petition
was
heard
by
the
district
court,
watson
was
the
only
significant
case
still
on
the
books
and
judge
peckham
following
that
decision,
declined
to
set
aside
the
conviction
on
the
grounds
that
the
discriminatory
classification
prevented
him
from
committing
him
under
the
title
ii
of
narcotics
act.
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
with
the
district
court
that
the
classification
was
not
an
arbitrary
one.
in
the
interim,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
had
decided
hamilton
which
clarified
the
situation
by
pointing
out
that
any
two
prior
felony
convictions
whether
narcotic
related
or
not,
would
be
discriminatory
classification
and
then
while
the
petition
for
cert
was
before
this
court,
the
first
circuit
followed
the
watson
decision
and
hamilton
decision
and
held
the
discriminatory
classification
a
violation
of
due
process
by
denying
equal
protections.
so
we
have
at
the
present
time
the
first
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit's
holding
that
statute
unconstitutional
as
it
improperly
discriminates,
the
fifth
and
ninth
circuit
holding
that
the
classification
is
a
reasonable
one.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
knew
that
one
of
your
honors
would
ask
that
question.
i’d
like
to
say,
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
trend
of
cases
after
jackson
versus
indiana
and
a
number
of
district
court
cases,
some
of
which
were
cited
by
this
court
in
jackson,
perhaps
are
leading
to
a
conclusion
that
treatment
for
an
ill
person
and
if
we
assume
the
premise
that
a
drug
addict
is
an
ill
person,
it
may
very
well
be
a
fundamental
interest
that
the
state
or
the
government
must
provide.
i
would
use
an
example
of
it.
if
we
are
going
to
commit
a
prisoner
to
the
medical
center
at
springfield
as
mentally
ill,
i
don’t
think
he
can
be
sent
there
and
then
not
treated
for
his
mental
illness.
and
i
certainly
don’t
think
that
you
can
deprive
him
of
treatment
for
his
mental
illness
on
the
grounds
that
he
might
have
a
bad
criminal
record.
i
would
like
to
say
that
this
is
a
fundamental
interest
that
we’re
talking
about,
but
i
realize
that
the
court
has
not
gone
that
far
and
i
would
have
to
say
that
perhaps,
we’re
talking
about
an
interest
more
in
the
social
welfare
economic
realm
than
in
a
fundamental
interest
area.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
oh
no!
no.
in
fact,
the
crux
of
our
argument
is
this.
we
say
marshall
had
a
right
to
be
considered
by
the
district
court.
now,
if
the
district
court
looked
at
his
record
and
said,
well,
he’s
a
dangerous
person.
his
crimes
of
violence
are
recent.
he
has
crimes
of
violence.
he
has
a
violent
background.
he’s
not
likely
to
respond
the
treatment.
the
district
court
can
exercise
its
discretion
and
not
commit
him
under
title
ii,
but
marshall
never
got
that
chance.
and
he
never
got
the
chance
because
the
two
prior
felony
exclusion
in
title
ii
operates
as
a
conclusive
presumption
that
he
is
not
likely
to
be
rehabilitated
and
that
is
the
irrational
classification
of
which
we
complain.
now,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
you,
your
honor
--[voice
overlap]
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
we’re
talking
in
the
narcotics
rehabilitation
act
about
two
titles.
title
i
is
the
civil
commitment
in
lieu
of
prosecution
and
the
thrust
of
the
legislative
history
aimed
towards
this
title
i
is
talking
about
escaping
punishment
and
so
forth.
and
i
certainly
have
no
quarrel
with
these
classifications
as
they
may
relate
to
title
i.
but
title
ii
is
a
prison
type
commitment.
it
is
a
commitment
to
a
federal
prison
where
the
drug
rehabilitation
program
is
made
available
within
a
prison
sentence.
he
is
under
the
supervision
on
after
care
of
the
board
of
paroles
as
any
other
prisoner
and
he
is
certainly
is
not
in
any
sense
of
the
word
escaping
punishment,
if
punishment
is
a
valid
objective.
so,
there
are
distinct
differences
between
title
i
and
ii.
the
felony
convictions
that
title
two
talks
about,
and
of
course
the
debarring
of
provisions
apply
to
title
i
with
equal
force,
need
not
be
violent
felonies.
they
need
not
be
current.
they
could
have
been
20
years
ago.
they
could
have
been
two
convictions,
one
for
mail
theft
and
one
for
forgery.
there’s
no
showing
that
--
no
necessity
that
they
even
had
been
drug-related.
they
may
be
in
one
jurisdiction
misdemeanors
and
then
another
jurisdiction
felonies.
they
may
be
subject
to
expungement
in
california,
but
perhaps
not
subject
to
expungement
in
the
district
of
columbia
since
there’s
no
provision
in
our
federal
court
for
expunging
a
criminal
record.
if
it’s
expunged,
it
doesn’t
count.
so,
it’s
obvious
that
the
two
prior
felony
provision
is
arbitrary
even
as
it’s
applied.
now,
the
question
that
we
would
like
this
court
to
consider
is
whether
or
not,
that
classification
of
two
prior
felonies
is
reasonably
related
to
affect
the
legislative
purpose
of
the
narcotic
addict
rehabilitation
act
and
we
submit
to
the
court
that
it
is
not.
there
absolutely
is
no
rational
connection
between
two
prior
felony
convictions
and
whether
or
not
the
addict
needs
treatment.
and
i
think
a
common
sense
approach
shows
that
it
operates
in
effect
as
a
conclusive
presumption
without
a
rational
nexus.
i
think
if
we
ask
the
man
on
the
street
a
very
common
sense
series
of
questions;
what
do
you
think
of
the
fact
that
perhaps
50%
of
the
drug
addicts
or
50%
of
the
street
crimes
are
committed
by
drug
addicts.
he
would
probably
say,
“i
agree
with
you.
that
is
probably
correct.”
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
that’s
right.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
at
the
present
time,
he
is
simply
not
committed
under
the
narcotic
addict
rehabilitation
act.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
oh
no,
your
honor.
if
he
is
in
an
institution
that
has
a
drug
program,
and
if
he
is
within
a
year
or
year-and-a-half
of
parole,
they
may
put
him
into
a
drug
program,
but
it’s
discretionary
with
the
prison
officials.
our
point
is
that
he
should
have
an
opportunity
as
any
other
member
of
the
class
could
be
considered
by
the
district
court
for
commitment
as
a
drug
addict,
where
he
is
guaranteed
drug
rehabilitative
treatment.
now
i’m
not
qualified
to
discuss
whether
or
not,
treatment
at
the
end
are
the
parole
period
is
better
or
worse
than
treatment
at
the
beginning
of
the
prison
period.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
a
person
whose
antisocial
behavior
is
the
product
of
drug
addiction
would
be
better
off
to
get
into
a
prison
program
that’s
oriented
to
drug
rehabilitation
from
the
beginning,
so
that
the
whole
rehabilitation
program
can
be
key
to
the
root
cause
of
the
problem
which
would
be
held
on
addiction
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes
it
is,
your
honor.
and
it
does,
i
think,
when
the
classification
of
having
been
convicted
of
two
prior
felonies,
bars
him
from
consideration
with
other
members
of
the
class
similarly
situated
because
it’s
our
position
and
the
position
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
the
first
circuit
that
there’s
just
no
rational
relationship
between
two
prior
felonies
and
likelihood
to
be
rehabilitated
which
is
the
prime
purpose
of
the
narcotic
rehabilitation
act.
now,
the
government
seems
to
justify
this
classification
on
the
basis
that
there’s
an
effort
to
limit
resources
available
toward
the
program.
now,
there
are
some
comments
in
the
legislative
history
concerning
available
resources
and
i
think
the
care
for
the
perusal
of
the
legislative
history
will
show
that
most
of
the
congressmen
and
senators
were
talking
about
title
i
and
the
facilities
that
might
have
to
be
built
under
the
public
health
service
in
order
to
handle
the
intake
that
would
be
created
by
opening
title
i,
the
commitment
in
lower
prosecution.
title
ii,
however,
or
commitments
to
the
federal
prisons
ostensibly
at
least,
the
convicted
prisoner
and
it’s
almost
always
a
felony
that
convicted
felon
will
go
to
a
federal
prison
anyhow.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
in
title
he
is
committed
to
go
the
surgeon
general.
they’re
not
committed
to
prison.
they’re
not
sentenced.
it’s
not
a
sentencing
provision.
that’s
the
commitment
in
lieu
of
prosecution.
that
was
the
area,
i
think
where
the
legislative
history
indicates
there
may
have
been
some
concern
about
available
resources,
certainly
not
as
to
title
ii.
no
prisons
had
to
be
built,
because
the
person
is
going
to
be
imprisoned
anyhow.
it’s
just
a
question
of
whether
or
not,
while
in
prison
he’s
going
to
get
drug
rehabilitation
treatment
or
whether
he’s
going
to
get
straight
prison
treatment.
there
may
or
may
not
be
drug-oriented
depending
upon
the
whim
of
the
prison
at
a
particular
time.
the
government
seeks
to
justify
on
the
grounds
that
available
resources
is
a
secondary
purpose
and
i
don’t
think
the
legislative
history
supports
it.
the
statute
hasn’t
built
an
escape
provision.
if
at
any
time,
the
attorney
general
finds
that
facilities
are
not
available
or
limited,
he
may
certify
and
not
take
any
drug
addicts
into
the
title
ii
program.
so,
the
availability
of
funds
is
always
subject
to
this
escape
valve
built
into
the
statute.
if
the
rationale
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
thanks,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
were
discussing
yesterday
it
was
our
position
as
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
held
in
hamilton
that
the
two
prior
felony
exclusion
operates
in
effect
as
a
conclusive
presumption
of
an
eligibility
and
that
the
rational
connection
between
two
prior
felony
convictions.
with
no
delineation
as
to
the
type
of
conviction,
the
time
of
conviction
or
other
circumstances
in
effect
would
deprive
an
applicant
who
would
be
otherwise
eligible
for
commitment
under
the
present
provisions
of
title
ii
from
an
opportunity
to
have
consideration
and
a
hearing.
now,
this
court
last
term
in
the
food
stamp
cases,
the
department
of
agriculture
versus
moreno
in
effect
struck
down
a
provision
similar
to
that
which
operated
as
a
conclusive
presumption
thereby
preventing
a
fair
hearing
of
the
merits,
a
person’s
eligibility.
i
would
submit
to
you
your
honors
that
that
would
be
basically
the
same
problem
here.
this
in
effect
fetters
the
hand
of
the
trial
judge
and
prevents
him
from
an
opportunity
to
fairly
evaluate
whether
or
not
the
particular
addict
should
be
sent
to
prison
for
addict
treatment
or
whether
he
should
be
sent
as
a
straight
offender
and
subject
to
whatever
rehabilitative
treatment
might
be
available.
we
feel
that
the
trial
judge’s
hand
should
be
unfettered.
that
this
constitutional
--
this
congressional
classification
is
in
effect
an
irrational
one
and
defeats
the
legislative
purpose
of
the
act.
it
would
appear
to
us
that
the
addict
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
marshall
did
have
in
effect
almost
a
fundamental
right
to
consideration
for
fair
and
effective
treatment
of
his
addiction.
as
we
pointed
out
yesterday,
we’re
not
talking
about
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no,
your
honor.
but
he
certainly
had
a
right
to
have
the
judge
consider
that
and
in
the
exercise
of
a
sound
judicial
discretion
determine
that
this
is
the
type
of
addict
who
was
likely
to
be
rehabilitated
and
who
may
have
treatment.
the
problem
here
is
that
the
judge
couldn’t
do
this
under
the
statute.
he
was
barred.
he
was
in
effect
prevented
from
even
an
opportunity
of
considering
this
man’s
background.
now,
it
may
well
be
that
the
congress
has
decided
to
keep
hiding
criminals
out
of
title
ii,
but
the
judge
can
do
that.
he
can
do
that
by
just
simply
not
exercising
his
sound
discretion
and
committing
him
under
title
ii
of
the
narcotics
act.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
think
certainly
congress
could
limit
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
and
provide
that
no
addict
could
be
committed
for
treatment.
but
where
it
has
created
a
class
and
a
class
to
which
mr.
marshall
is
a
member
and
then
excluded
him
from
the
class
on
the
basis
of
an
irrational
classification.
it
was
our
position
that
he
has
been
deprived
the
due
process
by
virtue
of
denial
of
equal
protections.
i
would
have
to
concede
that
congress
doesn’t
have
to
give
addict
treatment
to
addicts.
it
can
limit
the
course
of
jurisdiction
in
the
area
of
consideration
but
it
certainly
cannot
prevent,
marshall
the
petitioner
here,
from
consideration
on
the
basis
of
this
irrational
classification.
now,
the
government
seeks
to
justify
this
by
the
expedient
explanation
of
possible
subsidiary
purpose
in
the
legislation
to
conserve
economic
resources.
they
could’ve
made
that
argument
in
the
department
of
agriculture
food
stamp
cases
that
they
wanted
to
limit
the
number
of
people
eligible
for
food
stamps
to
save
money
and
thereby
justify
the
classification
but
it
wouldn’t
be
any
more
justified
in
that
particular
case
than
it
would
be
here.
most
of
the
legislative
history
that
the
government
has
cited
relates
to
some
apprehensions
that
congress
had
in
connection
with
expanding
the
existing
public
health
facilities
for
the
title
i,
the
prosecution
in
lieu
of
the
commitment
in
law
of
prosecution
provision
for
title
iii
of
the
voluntary
commitment
provision.
it
would
appear
from
the
examination
of
the
legislative
history
that
the
bureau
of
prisons
was
not
too
concerned
with
any
drain
upon
their
resources.
they
have
the
prisons,
the
person
who
is
going
to
go
to
prison,
it's
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he’s
going
to
go
and
get
addict
treatment
or
whether
he’s
going
to
go
and
in
effect
be
deprived
of
addict
treatment
or
get
it
only
at
the
whim
of
the
bureau
of
prisons.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
they
do
if
they
have
a
test
that
--
that
is
fair
and
certainly
a
test
that
is
not
based
upon
a
conclusive
presumption
of
being
a
hardened
criminal
simply
by
virtue
of
two
prior
felony
convictions.
what
we
object
to
is
the
fact
that
these
two
prior
felonies
could
have
been
30
years
ago.
they
could
have
been
for
the
most
innocuous
of
offenses
and
to
say
that
a
person
is
a
hardened
criminal
because
30
years
ago
he
was
convicted
of
theft
of
mail
or
forgery
of
a
treasury
check
to
relatively
innocuous
felonies.
to
say
that
he
is
a
hardened
criminal
and
therefore
he
is
not
eligible
to
treatment
in
prison
as
an
addict,
i
think
is
just
certainly
irrational
and
this
is
our
objection.
if
there
are
standards
applied
to
the
barring
provision
reasonably
related
to
the
purpose
of
the
legislation,
perhaps
our
position
would
not
be
quite
so
strong
but
i
feel
here
that
what
we
had
basically
is
a
recognition
that
narcotic
addiction
is
the
root
cause
of
a
good
deal
of
crime.
there
is
an
effort
on
the
part
of
congress
to
treat
addicts
by
giving
them
treatment
in
prison.
and
then
to
say
that
these
objectives
will
be
fulfilled
by
barring
from
that
very
treatment
those
with
criminal
records
is
an
irrational
conclusion.
in
fact,
it’s
almost
absurd
and
that
is
certainly
our
position
in
this
case.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
if
i
may
respond
to
some
of
the
solicitor
general’s
suggestions,
the
references
in
the
legislative
history
to
pilot
an
experimental,
i
think
were
aimed
directly,
for
the
most
part,
at
titles
i
and
iii.
the
concept
of
having
civil
commitment
in
lieu
of
prosecutions
or
a
voluntary
commitment
for
addicts
was
a
new
concept.
we
never
had
it
before.
but
during
the
legislative
history
they
discussed
the
experiences
in
new
york
and
california
with
this
type
of
commitment
and
i
certainly
don’t
think
there’s
anything
new
or
anything
novel
or
experimental
about
giving
the
best
treatment
that
the
prison
system
can
to
an
addict
who
is
imprisoned.
i
don’t
think,
certainly,
we
can
say
that
this
with
any
great
well
change.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no,
your
honor.
and
this
is
the
fallacy
of
the
government’s
argument.
at
the
present
time,
the
reason
that
the
addicts
are
being
released
in
approximately
18
months
after
they’re
committed
under
title
ii
is
that
the
only
addicts
in
prison
are
checks
towards
male
thieves.
no
one
with
any
prior
records
there,
no
one
with
a
crime
of
violence
is
there.
these
are
fairly
moderate
sentences
that
are
being
given.
probably
five
years
or
less
since
title
ii
provides
that
he
cannot
be
sentenced
in
excess
of
the
maximum
that
could
be
imposed.
we’re
not
talking
about
bank
robbers
or
kidnappers
or
people
who
engaged
in
violent
crimes.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
don’t
know
where
that
conclusion
comes
from.
it
certainly
not
my
experience
and
i’ve
been
in
the
criminal
justice
assistant
for
13
years.
it
depends
upon
the
individual.
it
depends
upon
his
propensities
other
than
addiction.
i
have
found
from
my
experience
that
the
older
addict
with
a
longer
criminal
record
is
more
amenable
to
rehabilitation
than
the
young
kid
who
is
just
getting
started.
he
doesn’t
have
the
maturity
and
the
experience
of
the
older
person.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
would
certainly
agree
that
it's
a
problem
but
i
hope
we
have
come
a
long
way
since
1896
in
penal
reform.
i
certainly
hope
that
we
are
doing
something
for
addicts
in
prison.
what
i
can
assure
you,
your
honors
that
addicts
sentenced
to
federal
prisons
do
not
get
treatment
unless
they
are
in
a
nara
program
or
unless
they
are
one
and
one
of
the
prisoners
that
has
a
program
with
openings,
and
there
are
only
12
of
those
i
understand
out
of
28.
and
two,
they
are
one
year
or
18
months
away
from
parole.
edward
marshall
was
sentenced
by
the
district
judge
to
10
years
parole
at
any
time
and
a
specific
recommendation
in
the
judgment
that
he
would
be
given
treatments
for
his
addiction
and
he
isn’t
getting
it,
simply
because
of
his
prior
felony
record.
he’s
not
getting
any
treatment
and
he’s
an
addict
in
prison.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
that
is
my
understanding.
twelve
federal
prisons
that
have
available
addict
facilities
out
of
28.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i’m
not
sure
that
all
of
them
have
available
facilities
for
title
ii
but
they
do
have
some
type
of
drug
treatment
program
in
existence.
and
i
think
it’s
fairly
well
conceded
and
the
government’s
response
to
my
memorandum
in
response
to
their
memorandum,
in
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
that
where
they
point
out
that
there
only
so
many
institution
and
that
addicts
do
not
get
treatment
on
a
straight
sentence
until
the
end
of
their
term
and
only
if
they’re
in
an
institution
where
such
treatment
is
available.
whether
this
is
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
treatment
keyed
as
contemplated
by
title
ii
of
the
act.
two,
addiction
is
the
root
cause
of
the
person's
antisocial
conduct.
what
the
medical
differences
are,
i’m
not
qualified
to
say.
there
must
be
a
different
treatment
otherwise
congress
would
not
have
to
pass
title
ii
but
at
least
under
title
two
and
i
would
point
out
to
your
honors,
that’s
not
a
civil
commitment.
the
statute
itself,
the
phraseology
of
title
ii
says,
“commitment
for
treatment
is
a
commitment
to
prison.”
the
civil
commitment
is
titles
i
and
iii,
it’s
keyed
to
psychiatric,
psychological
treatment
to
testing
and
two
various
type
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
not
at
all.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
don’t
know.
i
don’t
know
what
available
treatment
they
have
for
persons
serving
regular
sentences.
fort
worth
used
to
be
a
public
health
facility
and
an
answer
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
problem
or
question,
lexington
is
a
public
health
facility
and
to
my
knowledge,
that
there
maybe
a
few
prisoners
serving
sentences
that
are
put
there
for
administrative
reasons,
it
is
a
public
health
facility
and
i
understand
title
i
--
the
east
coast
toward
lexington.
we
use
to
send
title
i’s
in
the
west
coast
to
forth
worth
when
it
was
a
public
health
facility
but
several
years
ago,
when
forth
worth
was
transferred
to
the
bureau
of
prisons,
california
contract
was
made
with
catholic
charities
in
san
diego
for
the
commitment
of
title
i
addicts.
and
i’m
frank
to
admit
that
our
judges
were
not
so
anxious
to
use
title
i
to
send
them
to
san
diego
to
an
outpatient
type
program.
they
haven’t
use
it
nearly
as
much
as
we
used
to
it.
now,
the
judges
will
prefer
using
title
ii,
the
prison
type
commitment.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
no,
you
honor.
he
probably
be
on
terminal
island.
i
don’t
believe
there’s
a
nara
program
at
mcneal.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
wouldn’t
be
here
arguing
it
because
he
wouldn’t
have
a
constitutional
right
to
fair
treatment
being
a
member
of
a
class
just
being
discriminated
against
by
this
classification.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
and
by
some
prison
regulation
he
is
being
deprived
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
well,
i
think
those
are
more
reasonable,
more
reasonable
problems
that
they
might
having
connection
with
who
gets
into
a
program
by
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
the
bureau
of
prison
or
by
the
prison
authorities.
it
may
well
be
that
the
congress
had
vested
with
them
the
discretionary
power
to
decide
who
is
going
to
be
in
a
program
and
who
isn’t
on
some
quantitative
basis,we
have
a
different
problem
but
here
marshall
is
kept
out
not
on
the
basis
of
any
rational
determination
by
the
court.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
he
is
out
of
it
only
because
of
this
conclusion,
this
conclusive
presumption
that
he
is
a
dangerous,
vicious
criminal
on
a
basis
of
two
prior
criminal
--
two
prior
felony
convictions.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
as
i
read
the
legislative
history,
your
honor,
most
of
the
comments
were
concerning
civil
commitments
under
the
title
i
and
ii
as
being
a
novel
approach
to
the
problem.
and
that
most
of
the
conversation
was
in
connection
with
this
being
something
new
to
defer
prosecution
and
to
permit
an
offender
to
go
into
a
hospital
rather
than
to
be
prosecuted.
i
don’t
think
that
this
it
is
novel
to
put
into
the
prison
system,
a
narcotic
treatment
program
for
addicts.
and
this
wasn’t
that
revolutionary.
title
i
was
a
different
prosecution,
an
election
by
the
offenders
is
new.
it
was
novel
and
it
was
experimental.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
certainly
not
to
the
extent.
i
think
recent
legislation
has
opened
up
the
areas
of
providing
treatment
for
addicts.
of
course,
i
would
hope
that
the
prisons
are
trying
to
teach
the
root
cause
of
every
prisoner’s
problem.
if
it
would
be
addiction,
i
would
hope
they
will
give
him
some
kind
of
treatment.
here,
i
don’t
know
what
the
differences
are.
they’re
more
technical.
but
protection
of
society,
i
would
urge
upon
the
court,
is
not
the
objectives
of
the
narcotic
addict
rehabilitation
act.
it
maybe
a
noble
legislative
purpose
in
other
areas
but
i
don’t
think
that
the
solicitor
general
can
rely
upon
protection
of
society
to
justify
this
classification.
the
clear
purpose
of
the
narcotic
rehabilitation
act
is
to
rehabilitate
eligible
addicts
and
protection
of
the
society
simply
has
no
part
in
that
legislative
scheme.
we
concede
that
excluding
convicted
felons
may
protect
society
but
certainly
it
doesn’t
further
for
the
purposes
of
this
statute
which
is
to
rehabilitate
addicts
charged
with
an
offense.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
is
this
ultimate
purpose
of
protecting
society
by
eliminating
the
addiction.
but
i
don’t
think
the
purpose
of
this
statute
can
be
in
any
sense
of
the
word
be
to
protect
society
by
keeping
convicted
offenders
out
of
the
program
except
indirectly
by
perhaps
trying
to
rehabilitate
more
offenders.
what
we’re
talking
about
here
basically
is
a
scheme,
thus
designed
to
accomplish
a
certain
objective
and
irrational
classification
that
i
think
rather
than
furthering
the
objective
certainly
defeats
a
good
portion
of
it.
we
were
taking
the
position
that
this
is
almost
a
conclusive
presumption
that
prevents
the
trial
judge
from
exercising
his
discretion.
it
may
well
be
that
marshall
could
be
determined
by
the
trial
judge
not
suitable
for
treatment.
upon
an
examination
of
his
background,
the
judge
might
determine
that
the
felonies,
prior
felonies
were
not
drug
related.
they
were
violent
felonies
and
show
him
to
be
bad
man
and
not
give
him
the
treatment.
but
he
isn’t
escaping
punishment
if
he’s
committed
to
prison
for
addict
treatment.
he
could
be
kept
up
to
10
years
when
his
parole
was
within
the
discretion
of
the
board,
i’m
sure
they
are
not
going
to
let
him
out
until
he’s
ready
to
go
on
the
street.
he
goes
into
a
board
of
parole
supervised
after
care
program.
he’s
certainly
not
escaping
punishment
.those
policies
in
the
legislative
history
are
aimed
more
at
title
i
and
there’s
a
great
deal
of
confusion
about
conservation
of
available
resources
and
so
forth.
civil
commitment
is
the
terms
that
was
thrown
about.
this
is
not
a
civil
commitment.
it’s
a
penal
commitment
and
this
is
not
a
novel
program.
it
is
a
change
in
a
concept
of
penal
reform.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
it
certainly
does,
your
honor.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
some
offenses,
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
purpose
of
that
statute
is
to
impose
a
harsh
punishment
on
certain
types
of
offenders,
in
that
case
drug
pushers
is
reasonably
related
to
that
purpose.
the
punishment
--
here
the
object
is
not
punishment,
it’s
simply
rehabilitation
and
this
exclusion
does
not
accomplish
that
purpose.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
if
that’s
the
purpose,
your
honor,
then
the
classification
should
be
set
aside
because
it
is
not
reasonably
related
to
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
punishment
is
not
the
purpose.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
there’s
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
stated
purpose
that
would
indicate
there
was
any
desire.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
in
order
to
punish
them?
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
well,
i
think
it
is
certainly
beyond
the
stated
purpose
of
the
statute.
there’s
nothing
to
support
any
intention
upon
congress
to
punish
addicts
because
of
a
prior
criminal
record.
certainly,
they
are
being
punished
by
being
deprived
of
addict
treatment
that
other
similarly
situation
would
be
entitled
to.
but
i
certainly
don’t
think
that
this
furthers
any
legitimate
legislative
objective.
so,
this
is
not
a
penal
statute
imposing
punishment
for
any
offense.
he’s
being
punished
indirectly.
everyone
who
is
deprived
of
a
constitutional
right
is
being
punished
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
i
don’t
think
it
has
any
purpose,
your
honor.
that’s
why
we
are
here
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
they
say
the
purpose
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
conserve
available
resources.
to
limit
the
--
[voice
overlap]
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
they
can
only
--
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
but
that
cannot
be
justified
when
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
the
rehabilitation
of
offenders
because
there’s
no
rational
relationship
between
punishment
and
the
context
of
this
statute
and
rehabilitation
of
narcotic
addicts.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
but
for
that
exclusion
he
would
be,
your
honor.
he
would
be
a
member
of
an
eligible
class
but
for
the
prior
felonies.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
yes,
your
honor
and
i’d
say
that
this
is
not
reasonable
as
the
government
says
it
is
because
it’s
related
to
a
legitimate
purpose
of
the
statute
and
that
it
conserves
available
resources
and
it’s
our
position
that
that’s
not
sufficient.
mr.
james
f.
hewitt
thank
you,
your
honor.
