ms.

s.
lafontant
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
statement
of
facts
yesterday,
petitioner
remarked
that
there
was
no
gun
involved
in
the
robbery
of
the
bank.
i
do
want
to
bring
out,
however,
that
when
petitioner
entered
this
bank,
he
presented
a
note
to
a
teller
who
happened
to
be
a
moonlighting
police
officer
and
that
note
said
i
have
a
gun,
i
don’t
want
to
hurt
anyone
just
hand
over
the
money.
petitioner
also
states
that
that
crime
was
reduced
from
a
crime
of
violence
because
certainly
robbery
of
the
bank
is
a
crime
of
violence
and
it
was
reduced
to
larceny.
had
it
not
been
reduced
to
larceny,
he
would
have
been
excluded
from
the
provisions
of
title
i
and
title
ii
as
having
been
found
guilty
of
a
crime
of
violence.
petitioner
contends
that
the
provisions
of
title
ii
of
the
act
which
excludes
persons
with
two
prior
felony
convictions
from
its
benefits
is
unconstitutional
under
the
equal
protection
clause
embodied
in
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
in
his
brief,
he
compares
title
iii
with
title
ii
complaining
that
a
person
like
himself,
a
possessor
of
a
two
felony
conviction
record
cannot
trade
his
felony.
his
third
felony
conviction
for
commitment
under
title
ii
while
a
person
with
three
or
more
felony
convictions,
in
fact
any
number
of
felony
convictions
maybe
committed
under
title
iii
as
long
as
he
has
completed
all
of
his
prior
sentences
of
conviction
and
as
long
as
there’s
no
pending
criminal
charge
against
him.
petitioner
argues
this
classification
is
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
and
has
no
rational
basis.
if
we
look
at
the
act,
we
can
say
just
from
a
mere
cursory
reading
of
it
that
the
purpose
is
obvious.
this
isn’t
a
case
where
we
have
to
go
to
the
congressional
record,
review
the
hearings,
review
what
all
the
representatives
said
although
it’s
very
interesting
reading
to
interpret
the
act’s
meaning.
the
act
is
unambiguous
and
is
clear.
it
provides
for
the
treatment
and
rehabilitation
of
narcotic
addicts
and
in
addition
provides
in
title
i
and
title
ii,
the
commitment
for
treatment
in
lieu
of
penal
incarceration.
the
act
is
three-pronged.
the
title
i
provides
for
civil
commitment
in
lieu
of
trial
for
certain
consenting
narcotic
addicts
charged
with
federal
offenses.
title
ii,
the
one
that
we’re
concerned
with
today
provides
for
a
similar
civil
commitment
in
lieu
of
penal
incarceration
for
narcotic
addicts
who
have
already
been
convicted
of
a
federal
offense.
and
title
iii
provides
for
civil
commitment
at
the
instance
of
the
addict
himself
or
at
the
instance
of
the
related
individual.
and
it’s
clear
from
title
iii
that
congress
did
not
wish
to
foreclose
the
multiple
offender
from
treatment
for
his
addiction.
because
under
title
iii,
no
person
is
excluded
except
the
person
who
has
a
pending
charge
against
him
or
who
hasn’t
completed
his
sentences
under
prior
convictions.
in
other
words,
a
multiple
offender
can
be
committed
under
title
iii,
to
a
hospital
for
treatment
for
his
addiction.
but
we
must
recognized
that
title
iii
--
that
title
iii
addict
doesn’t
present
any
new
menace
to
society.
the
prison
under
title
iii
is
a
person
who
is
free
in
the
community
already
having
paid
his
debt
to
society.
and
when
he
seeks
treatment
as
an
addict,
he’s
not
entering
to
escape
a
pending
charge
or
any
future
punishment.
he
sincerely
is
seeking
physical
and
psychological
therapy
voluntarily.
petitioner
makes
much
to
do
over
the
fact
that
a
third
person
can
have
himself
committed
under
title
iii
and
the
fact
that
the
third
person
can
bring
him
in
makes
this
less
than
a
voluntary
act.
but
whether
or
not
the
request
for
treatment
under
article
iii
is
voluntary
is
really
not
too
important.
the
important
item
is
that
the
addict
is
already
in
the
community
and
in
seeking
help
is
removing
himself
from
free
intercourse
with
society
for
hospital
treatment.
petitioner
asserts
that
treatment
for
an
ill
person
should
be
guaranteed
and
that
he
would
like
it
to
be
a
fundamental
right
and
that
the
state
should
provide
treatment
for
all
these
people.
in
powell
versus
texas,
mr.
justice
marshall
stated
that
and
i
quote,
“this
court
has
never
held
that
anything
requires
that
penal
sanctions
be
designed
solely
to
achieve
therapeutic
or
rehabilitative
effects”.
but
we’re
not
even
arguing
here,
the
petitioner
should
not
receive
treatment.
we
do
maintain
that
he
has
no
basic
right
to
trade
treatment
for
commitment.
petitioner
would
have
us
believe
that
in
denying
him
benefits
under
title
ii
that
he’s
denied
all
types
of
treatment.
this
is
not
true.
he’s
only
being
denied
the
privilege
of
trading
that
commitment
under
title
ii
for
penal
incarceration.
i’m
advised
by
the
bureau
of
prisons
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes
indeed
and
that’s
a
very
good
point
that
you’re
raising
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
i
am
addressing
myself
to
that
even
later
in
the
argument
but
the
answer
to
it
is
definitely,
yes.
i’m
advised
by
the
bureau
of
prisons
that
all
addicts
in
the
federal
prisons
are
eligible
for
treatment
and
do
receive
treatment.
and
the
only
thing
that
limits
the
kind
of
treatment
they
get
is
the
lack
of
resources
and
sometimes
the
lack
of
motivation
of
the
offender
himself.
but
in
all
of
our
federal
institutions
we
have
rehabilitative
program
set
up.
at
this
time,
we
have
14
intensified
medical
programs
and
by
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year,
we
expect
16.
however,
there
is
a
difference
which
you
have
addressed
yourself
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
people
committed
under
nara
are
treated
somewhat
differently
from
the
non-nara
addicts.
the
nara
addicts
are
put
into
intensified
treatment
immediately
and
they
are
released
on
an
average
within
17
months
back
to
the
community.
many
of
them
are
released
within
six
months
of
the
time
they
enter
the
treatment
but
on
the
average
i’m
informed
it
is
17
months
and
then
they
are
released
into
the
community
with
intensive
follow-up
care.
in
response
to
the
inquiry
of
the
chief
justice,
as
to
whether
or
not
non-nara
addicts
are
foreclosed
from
treatment
in
federal
penitentiaries,
the
answer
is
definitely
“no”.
we
do
have
rehabilitative
treatment
in
the
jails
for
persons
who
are
serving
regular
federal
prison
terms
and
who
happen
to
be
in
addition,
addicts.
they
all
receive
some
treatment
upon
commitment,
if
no
more
than
when
they
first
get
there
they
are
dried
out
within
three
days
to
three
weeks.
in
fact
,the
physiological
desire
for
narcotics
has
been
gotten
rid
of
within
three
months
to
six
months.
so,
they
do
receive
that.
in
addition,
to
that
we
have
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
one
thing
is
that
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that
would
be
true
but
i
understand
in
our
federal
prisons
that
we
have
medical
doctors
who
helped
these
people
during
their
withdrawals
periods.
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
counselors
who
help
these
people
who
were
not
nara,
committed
under
nara,
to
help
them
in
their
motivation,
also
to
help
them
not
only
get
rid
of
their
addiction
but
actually
to
get
rid
of
their
non-criminal
behavior
through
various
social
and
psychological
services
that
are
rendered
in
the
jail.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
they
try
to
find
that
upon
immediate
entry
which
takes
up
to
six
weeks
but
they
often
find
out
within
the
first
week
whether
or
not
the
person
is
an
addict.
first,
they
ask
the
offender
himself,
are
you
on
drugs?
what
do
you
use
and
are
you
truly
an
addict
and
of
course
they
have
to
depend
a
lot
upon
what
the
offender
tells
them
also.
but
they
do
have
follow
up
medical
treatment
as
well
as
psychotherapy
in
the
ordinary
federal
prison.
i’m
also
advised
that
in
addition
to
--
they
set
goals
for
these
people
as
they
come
in
as
to
whether
they
can
finish
high
school
or
finish
grade
school,
try
to
teach
them
whether
or
not
they
can
learn
and
trade.
all
this
is
started
with
this
person
whether
or
not
he
is
an
addict.
but
in
addition
to
being
an
addict,
he
does
get
help
in
that
area.
and
i’m
informed
the
only
limitation
on
it
is
lack
of
resources
and
the
lack
of
motivation
of
the
prisoner
himself
who
may
not
use
the
resources
that
are
there.
the
intensified
treatment,
i
am
told
however
does
not
begin
until
12
to
18
months
before
the
prisoner
is
to
be
released.
so,
the
person
who’s
committed
under
nara
starts
getting
his
intensive
treatment
immediately
12
to
18
--
for
12
to
18
months
and
then
he
is
to
be
released
into
society,
whereas
the
person
who
has
had
a
longer
sentence,
the
intensified
treatment
i
am
told
is
not
begun
until
he
is
–
till
12
to
18
months
before
he’s
to
be
released.
and
this
is
supposed
to
be
because
the
experts
feel
that
it’s
too
early
to
start
an
intensified
program
preparing
the
inmate
for
release
to
society
earlier
than
12
to
18
months.
it
means
however
that
a
person
who
has
a
10-year
sentence
would
not
be
able
to
go
back
into
society
within
six
months
or
within
18
months
because
they
would
figure
his
time
from
the
length
of
his
term
and
figure
it
back.
while
allowing
commitment
under
title
iii,
congress
did
not
want
the
nara
to
supersede
in
all
instances
the
established
commitment
procedures
for
all
offenders
who
happen
to
be
additionally
narcotic
addicts.
they
didn’t
want
persons
facing
a
criminal
charge
to
use
the
act
to
escape
punishment.
the
act
is
created
a
special
benefit
for
offenders
who
are
also
narcotic
addicts
and
in
so
doing
has
set
up
standards
of
eligibility
and
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
brought
out
yesterday,
that
the
applicable
standard
here
is
one
of
rationality.
the
apparent
claims
that
the
standards
set
up
by
congress
namely
the
exclusion
of
a
certain
class
of
convicted
felons
in
unreasonable.
what
is
the
nature
of
the
privilege
or
right
created
by
this
act
which
grant
certain
classes
of
offenders,
the
option
to
trade
imprisonment
for
commitment
for
rehabilitation
purposes?
can
the
offender
trade
off
his
addiction
treatment
for
the
rest
of
his
term?
to
what
extent
can
congress
set
up
of
standards
of
eligibility
for
benefits
granted
by
it?
congress
has
said
that
persons,
like
a
felon
who
has
been
convicted
of
two
prior
felonies,
cannot
escape
punishment
by
the
mere
fact
of
submission
to
treatment
for
his
addiction.
the
exclusion
of
the
class
of
addicts
to
which
petitioner
belongs
does
not
constitute
as
to
a
felony
deprivation
of
due
process.
the
question
of
due
process
was
taken
care
of
at
the
time
of
his
trial.
president
lyndon
johnson
in
urging
the
passage
of
this
act
back
in
1965
when
he
addressed
congress,
felt
that
the
protection
of
the
public
was
not
only
important
but
was
required
and
he
said,
“the
return
of
the
narcotic
and
marijuana
users
to
useful
productive
lives
is
of
obvious
benefit
to
them
and
to
society
at
large.
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
essential
to
assure
adequate
protection
of
the
general
public.”
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
but
i
respectfully
submit
that
there’s
nothing
in
this
case
that
would
indicate
that
what
mr.
hewitt
is
saying
is
at
all
true
because
he
is
saying
because
this
man
is
an
addict.
he’s
entitled
to
the
same
treatment
as
everyone
else
who
happens
to
be
an
addict.
there
is
no
constitutional
guarantee
that
addicts
are
going
to
have
a
certain
treatment
over
and
above,
i
mean
nara
addicts
are
to
get
better
treatment
than
non-nara
addicts.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
i
would
say
that
for
the
protection
of
society,
that
it
was
necessary
for
congress
to
set
up
certain
standards
and
unless
these
standards
are
irrational
or
unreasonable
then
petitioner
is
not
in
a
position
to
complain
about
lack
of
due
process.
representative
helstowski
at
the
hearings
in
1966
followed
up
on
what
president
johnson
has
--
the
quote
that
i
just
read
from
president
johnson’s
address
to
the
congress.
he
said,
the
hostile
9167
is
not
a
bleeding
heart
measure
which
would
result
in
releasing
people
into
society
who
are
dangerous
to
others
or
to
themselves.
neither
is
it
a
measure
which
could
be
used
to
make
excuses
and
provide
a
cover
for
vicious
criminals.
the
purpose
of
this
bill
is
the
same
as
the
purposes
of
the
present
laws
and
that
is
to
protect
society.
now,
certainly
the
interest
of
the
public
at
large.
yes,
the
law
abiding
the
non-addict
public,
if
you
please,
is
served
by
the
withholding
from
society
for
a
period
of
time
prescribed
by
the
court
of
repeated
offenders
and
reasonable
indeed
is
a
classification
which
is
based
upon
the
need
to
withhold
from
free
intercourse
with
society
those
elements
who
have
offended
it,
who
have
committed
certain
crimes
more
than
a
certain
number
of
times.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes
sir.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
some
rough
judgment
like
that
which
is
supported
by
some
of
the
cases
which
i’d
like
to
go
into
and
is
supported
by
the
findings
of
nara
itself.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
well,
certainly
i
would
agree
with
petitioner
that
there
should
be
a
classification
that
could
keep
these
hardened
criminals
apart
from
the
first
offender,
the
youthful
offender.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes
in
fact
congressman
mcclure
from
state
of
illinois
presented
that
point
of
view
before
the
congress
very
clearly
because
he
pointed
out
that
what
he
was
concerned
with
most
and
felt
that
this
act
would
be
concerned
with
most
would
be
addicts
who
are
primarily,
addicts
and
secondarily,
criminals.
he
also
said
that
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
mix
the
hardened
criminal
with
the
young,
helpless
addict
that
committed
only
one
crime.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
it
is
sir.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
as
i
understand
it
now,
the
nara
people
are
located
primarily
at
milan,
michigan,
denver,
connecticut,
terminal
island,
california
anderson,
west
virginian
and
fort
worth,
texas.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
not
springfield
and
lexington
evidently
is
out
too
although
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
this
act
forth
worth
and
lexington
were
the
two
main
institutions.
this
court
has
so
held
that
it
is
referring
to
the
multiple
offenders
has
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
habitual
offender’s
statute
in
moore
versus
missouri,
graham
versus
west
virginia.
in
the
moore
case
excluding
from
people
versus
stanley,
the
court
said,
“the
punishment
for
the
second
is
increased
because
by
his
persistence
in
the
perpetration
of
crime,
he
has
evinced
state
depravity
which
merits
a
greater
punishment
and
needs
to
be
restrained
by
severe
penalties
than
if
it
were
his
first
offense.”
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
the
graham
was
1912,
moore
was
about
1896.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
moore
is
159
united
states
673
and
graham
is
224
us
616.
and
so
important
is
the
offender's
prior
history
of
criminality
that
most
states
make
a
prison
whose
is
convicted
of
more
than
two
crimes
ineligible
for
probation.
in
many
states
like
wyoming,
only
first
offenders
can
be
granted
or
even
considered
for
probation.
and
on
a
federal
level
we
find
this
is
important
too.
in
the
policy
statement
of
the
drug
abuse
manual
of
april
20th,
1973
issued
by
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
is
made
clear
that
previous
criminality
and
seriousness
of
offenses
are
reasonable
considerations
in
parole
matters.
in
title
xxiix,
section
2.24
reveals
that
the
united
states
board
of
parole
generally
considers
such
factors
as
an
offender’s
prior
criminal
record,
the
nature
in
the
pattern
of
his
offenses.
thus,
they
have
been
both
judicial
and
legislative
determinations
of
the
rationality
of
the
classifications
in
issue
here.
it’s
neither
irrational
nor
unreasonable
for
congress
to
find
a
second
time
offender
presents
a
greater
risk
to
society
than
a
risk
or
menace
presented
by
the
one
time
offender.
even
nara
with
its
carefully
selected
clientele
has
concluded
that
first
offenders
fair
better
than
repeaters.
in
the
creation
of
statutory
rights,
congress
can
define
the
class
of
persons
that
will
receive
that
benefit
of
the
statutorily
created
right.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes
sir
and
there’s
a
greater
degree
of
success
in
the
community
after
they’re
released
from
the
first
offender
than
from
the
repeater.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
not
--
as
far
as
narcotic
addiction
primarily,
but
even
for
subsequent
crimes
because
the
theory
is
that
most
of
the
people
who
are
convicted
under
nara,
the
only
reason
they
are
guilty
of
a
crime
is
to
support
that
habit
which
is
still
questionable
whether
that’s
true
or
not
but
that’s
the
theory
they
are
going
on
so
the
figured
that
if
they’ve
cured
the
addict
and
he
doesn’t
need
to
steal
in
order
to
support
an
expensive
habit
then
he
can
become
rehabilitated.
and
they
have
found
that
the
first
offender
fairs
better
than
the
repeater
on
both
counts
as
an
addict
and
as
a
criminal.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
as
our
brief
points
out,
i
think
more
than
half
of
our
argument
is
devoted
to
the
fact
that
this
was
a
pilot
program
initiated.
this
is
the
first
major
act
in
this
area
that
has
been
taken
since
1940.
it
was
recognized
that
very
few
people
really
know
much
about
addiction
and
the
problems
and
the
cures.
it
was
the
beginning
program,
a
pilot
program
they
wanted
something
to
be
done
but
at
the
same
time
they
knew
that
not
only
because
of
lack
of
resources
but
because
of
lack
of
knowledge,
they
weren’t
willing
to
open
it
up
to
the
whole
addict
public.
they
had
to
start
somewhere
and
in
starting
somewhere
they
had
to
draw
classifications
also,
and
this
certainly
would
be
a
reasonable
classification.
since
1966,
many
institutions
have
been
built
and
it
has
included
more
and
more
people
even
now.
they’ve
gone
further
than
just
say
the
hard
addict.
they
treat
people
who
are
on
barbiturates
and
pediments.
but
you’re
perfectly
right,
mr.
chief
justice
that
it
was
a
pilot
program
and
the
line
had
to
be
drawn
somewhere.
we
respectfully
submit
that
drawing
the
line
at
this
point
was
perfectly
reasonable
and
that
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
the
statement
of
facts
yesterday,
petitioner
remarked
that
there
was
no
gun
involved
in
the
robbery
of
the
bank.
i
do
want
to
bring
out,
however,
that
when
petitioner
entered
this
bank,
he
presented
a
note
to
a
teller
who
happened
to
be
a
moonlighting
police
officer
and
that
note
said
i
have
a
gun,
i
don’t
want
to
hurt
anyone
just
hand
over
the
money.
petitioner
also
states
that
that
crime
was
reduced
from
a
crime
of
violence
because
certainly
robbery
of
the
bank
is
a
crime
of
violence
and
it
was
reduced
to
larceny.
had
it
not
been
reduced
to
larceny,
he
would
have
been
excluded
from
the
provisions
of
title
i
and
title
ii
as
having
been
found
guilty
of
a
crime
of
violence.
petitioner
contends
that
the
provisions
of
title
ii
of
the
act
which
excludes
persons
with
two
prior
felony
convictions
from
its
benefits
is
unconstitutional
under
the
equal
protection
clause
embodied
in
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
in
his
brief,
he
compares
title
iii
with
title
ii
complaining
that
a
person
like
himself,
a
possessor
of
a
two
felony
conviction
record
cannot
trade
his
felony.
his
third
felony
conviction
for
commitment
under
title
ii
while
a
person
with
three
or
more
felony
convictions,
in
fact
any
number
of
felony
convictions
maybe
committed
under
title
iii
as
long
as
he
has
completed
all
of
his
prior
sentences
of
conviction
and
as
long
as
there’s
no
pending
criminal
charge
against
him.
petitioner
argues
this
classification
is
arbitrary
and
unreasonable
and
has
no
rational
basis.
if
we
look
at
the
act,
we
can
say
just
from
a
mere
cursory
reading
of
it
that
the
purpose
is
obvious.
this
isn’t
a
case
where
we
have
to
go
to
the
congressional
record,
review
the
hearings,
review
what
all
the
representatives
said
although
it’s
very
interesting
reading
to
interpret
the
act’s
meaning.
the
act
is
unambiguous
and
is
clear.
it
provides
for
the
treatment
and
rehabilitation
of
narcotic
addicts
and
in
addition
provides
in
title
i
and
title
ii,
the
commitment
for
treatment
in
lieu
of
penal
incarceration.
the
act
is
three-pronged.
the
title
i
provides
for
civil
commitment
in
lieu
of
trial
for
certain
consenting
narcotic
addicts
charged
with
federal
offenses.
title
ii,
the
one
that
we’re
concerned
with
today
provides
for
a
similar
civil
commitment
in
lieu
of
penal
incarceration
for
narcotic
addicts
who
have
already
been
convicted
of
a
federal
offense.
and
title
iii
provides
for
civil
commitment
at
the
instance
of
the
addict
himself
or
at
the
instance
of
the
related
individual.
and
it’s
clear
from
title
iii
that
congress
did
not
wish
to
foreclose
the
multiple
offender
from
treatment
for
his
addiction.
because
under
title
iii,
no
person
is
excluded
except
the
person
who
has
a
pending
charge
against
him
or
who
hasn’t
completed
his
sentences
under
prior
convictions.
in
other
words,
a
multiple
offender
can
be
committed
under
title
iii,
to
a
hospital
for
treatment
for
his
addiction.
but
we
must
recognized
that
title
iii
--
that
title
iii
addict
doesn’t
present
any
new
menace
to
society.
the
prison
under
title
iii
is
a
person
who
is
free
in
the
community
already
having
paid
his
debt
to
society.
and
when
he
seeks
treatment
as
an
addict,
he’s
not
entering
to
escape
a
pending
charge
or
any
future
punishment.
he
sincerely
is
seeking
physical
and
psychological
therapy
voluntarily.
petitioner
makes
much
to
do
over
the
fact
that
a
third
person
can
have
himself
committed
under
title
iii
and
the
fact
that
the
third
person
can
bring
him
in
makes
this
less
than
a
voluntary
act.
but
whether
or
not
the
request
for
treatment
under
article
iii
is
voluntary
is
really
not
too
important.
the
important
item
is
that
the
addict
is
already
in
the
community
and
in
seeking
help
is
removing
himself
from
free
intercourse
with
society
for
hospital
treatment.
petitioner
asserts
that
treatment
for
an
ill
person
should
be
guaranteed
and
that
he
would
like
it
to
be
a
fundamental
right
and
that
the
state
should
provide
treatment
for
all
these
people.
in
powell
versus
texas,
mr.
justice
marshall
stated
that
and
i
quote,
“this
court
has
never
held
that
anything
requires
that
penal
sanctions
be
designed
solely
to
achieve
therapeutic
or
rehabilitative
effects”.
but
we’re
not
even
arguing
here,
the
petitioner
should
not
receive
treatment.
we
do
maintain
that
he
has
no
basic
right
to
trade
treatment
for
commitment.
petitioner
would
have
us
believe
that
in
denying
him
benefits
under
title
ii
that
he’s
denied
all
types
of
treatment.
this
is
not
true.
he’s
only
being
denied
the
privilege
of
trading
that
commitment
under
title
ii
for
penal
incarceration.
i’m
advised
by
the
bureau
of
prisons
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes
indeed
and
that’s
a
very
good
point
that
you’re
raising
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
i
am
addressing
myself
to
that
even
later
in
the
argument
but
the
answer
to
it
is
definitely,
yes.
i’m
advised
by
the
bureau
of
prisons
that
all
addicts
in
the
federal
prisons
are
eligible
for
treatment
and
do
receive
treatment.
and
the
only
thing
that
limits
the
kind
of
treatment
they
get
is
the
lack
of
resources
and
sometimes
the
lack
of
motivation
of
the
offender
himself.
but
in
all
of
our
federal
institutions
we
have
rehabilitative
program
set
up.
at
this
time,
we
have
14
intensified
medical
programs
and
by
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year,
we
expect
16.
however,
there
is
a
difference
which
you
have
addressed
yourself
to
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
the
people
committed
under
nara
are
treated
somewhat
differently
from
the
non-nara
addicts.
the
nara
addicts
are
put
into
intensified
treatment
immediately
and
they
are
released
on
an
average
within
17
months
back
to
the
community.
many
of
them
are
released
within
six
months
of
the
time
they
enter
the
treatment
but
on
the
average
i’m
informed
it
is
17
months
and
then
they
are
released
into
the
community
with
intensive
follow-up
care.
in
response
to
the
inquiry
of
the
chief
justice,
as
to
whether
or
not
non-nara
addicts
are
foreclosed
from
treatment
in
federal
penitentiaries,
the
answer
is
definitely
“no”.
we
do
have
rehabilitative
treatment
in
the
jails
for
persons
who
are
serving
regular
federal
prison
terms
and
who
happen
to
be
in
addition,
addicts.
they
all
receive
some
treatment
upon
commitment,
if
no
more
than
when
they
first
get
there
they
are
dried
out
within
three
days
to
three
weeks.
in
fact
,the
physiological
desire
for
narcotics
has
been
gotten
rid
of
within
three
months
to
six
months.
so,
they
do
receive
that.
in
addition,
to
that
we
have
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
one
thing
is
that
--
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
that
would
be
true
but
i
understand
in
our
federal
prisons
that
we
have
medical
doctors
who
helped
these
people
during
their
withdrawals
periods.
in
addition
to
that,
we
have
counselors
who
help
these
people
who
were
not
nara,
committed
under
nara,
to
help
them
in
their
motivation,
also
to
help
them
not
only
get
rid
of
their
addiction
but
actually
to
get
rid
of
their
non-criminal
behavior
through
various
social
and
psychological
services
that
are
rendered
in
the
jail.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
they
try
to
find
that
upon
immediate
entry
which
takes
up
to
six
weeks
but
they
often
find
out
within
the
first
week
whether
or
not
the
person
is
an
addict.
first,
they
ask
the
offender
himself,
are
you
on
drugs?
what
do
you
use
and
are
you
truly
an
addict
and
of
course
they
have
to
depend
a
lot
upon
what
the
offender
tells
them
also.
but
they
do
have
follow
up
medical
treatment
as
well
as
psychotherapy
in
the
ordinary
federal
prison.
i’m
also
advised
that
in
addition
to
--
they
set
goals
for
these
people
as
they
come
in
as
to
whether
they
can
finish
high
school
or
finish
grade
school,
try
to
teach
them
whether
or
not
they
can
learn
and
trade.
all
this
is
started
with
this
person
whether
or
not
he
is
an
addict.
but
in
addition
to
being
an
addict,
he
does
get
help
in
that
area.
and
i’m
informed
the
only
limitation
on
it
is
lack
of
resources
and
the
lack
of
motivation
of
the
prisoner
himself
who
may
not
use
the
resources
that
are
there.
the
intensified
treatment,
i
am
told
however
does
not
begin
until
12
to
18
months
before
the
prisoner
is
to
be
released.
so,
the
person
who’s
committed
under
nara
starts
getting
his
intensive
treatment
immediately
12
to
18
--
for
12
to
18
months
and
then
he
is
to
be
released
into
society,
whereas
the
person
who
has
had
a
longer
sentence,
the
intensified
treatment
i
am
told
is
not
begun
until
he
is
–
till
12
to
18
months
before
he’s
to
be
released.
and
this
is
supposed
to
be
because
the
experts
feel
that
it’s
too
early
to
start
an
intensified
program
preparing
the
inmate
for
release
to
society
earlier
than
12
to
18
months.
it
means
however
that
a
person
who
has
a
10-year
sentence
would
not
be
able
to
go
back
into
society
within
six
months
or
within
18
months
because
they
would
figure
his
time
from
the
length
of
his
term
and
figure
it
back.
while
allowing
commitment
under
title
iii,
congress
did
not
want
the
nara
to
supersede
in
all
instances
the
established
commitment
procedures
for
all
offenders
who
happen
to
be
additionally
narcotic
addicts.
they
didn’t
want
persons
facing
a
criminal
charge
to
use
the
act
to
escape
punishment.
the
act
is
created
a
special
benefit
for
offenders
who
are
also
narcotic
addicts
and
in
so
doing
has
set
up
standards
of
eligibility
and
as
mr.
justice
blackmun
brought
out
yesterday,
that
the
applicable
standard
here
is
one
of
rationality.
the
apparent
claims
that
the
standards
set
up
by
congress
namely
the
exclusion
of
a
certain
class
of
convicted
felons
in
unreasonable.
what
is
the
nature
of
the
privilege
or
right
created
by
this
act
which
grant
certain
classes
of
offenders,
the
option
to
trade
imprisonment
for
commitment
for
rehabilitation
purposes?
can
the
offender
trade
off
his
addiction
treatment
for
the
rest
of
his
term?
to
what
extent
can
congress
set
up
of
standards
of
eligibility
for
benefits
granted
by
it?
congress
has
said
that
persons,
like
a
felon
who
has
been
convicted
of
two
prior
felonies,
cannot
escape
punishment
by
the
mere
fact
of
submission
to
treatment
for
his
addiction.
the
exclusion
of
the
class
of
addicts
to
which
petitioner
belongs
does
not
constitute
as
to
a
felony
deprivation
of
due
process.
the
question
of
due
process
was
taken
care
of
at
the
time
of
his
trial.
president
lyndon
johnson
in
urging
the
passage
of
this
act
back
in
1965
when
he
addressed
congress,
felt
that
the
protection
of
the
public
was
not
only
important
but
was
required
and
he
said,
“the
return
of
the
narcotic
and
marijuana
users
to
useful
productive
lives
is
of
obvious
benefit
to
them
and
to
society
at
large.
but
at
the
same
time
it
is
essential
to
assure
adequate
protection
of
the
general
public.”
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
but
i
respectfully
submit
that
there’s
nothing
in
this
case
that
would
indicate
that
what
mr.
hewitt
is
saying
is
at
all
true
because
he
is
saying
because
this
man
is
an
addict.
he’s
entitled
to
the
same
treatment
as
everyone
else
who
happens
to
be
an
addict.
there
is
no
constitutional
guarantee
that
addicts
are
going
to
have
a
certain
treatment
over
and
above,
i
mean
nara
addicts
are
to
get
better
treatment
than
non-nara
addicts.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
i
would
say
that
for
the
protection
of
society,
that
it
was
necessary
for
congress
to
set
up
certain
standards
and
unless
these
standards
are
irrational
or
unreasonable
then
petitioner
is
not
in
a
position
to
complain
about
lack
of
due
process.
representative
helstowski
at
the
hearings
in
1966
followed
up
on
what
president
johnson
has
--
the
quote
that
i
just
read
from
president
johnson’s
address
to
the
congress.
he
said,
the
hostile
9167
is
not
a
bleeding
heart
measure
which
would
result
in
releasing
people
into
society
who
are
dangerous
to
others
or
to
themselves.
neither
is
it
a
measure
which
could
be
used
to
make
excuses
and
provide
a
cover
for
vicious
criminals.
the
purpose
of
this
bill
is
the
same
as
the
purposes
of
the
present
laws
and
that
is
to
protect
society.
now,
certainly
the
interest
of
the
public
at
large.
yes,
the
law
abiding
the
non-addict
public,
if
you
please,
is
served
by
the
withholding
from
society
for
a
period
of
time
prescribed
by
the
court
of
repeated
offenders
and
reasonable
indeed
is
a
classification
which
is
based
upon
the
need
to
withhold
from
free
intercourse
with
society
those
elements
who
have
offended
it,
who
have
committed
certain
crimes
more
than
a
certain
number
of
times.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes
sir.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
some
rough
judgment
like
that
which
is
supported
by
some
of
the
cases
which
i’d
like
to
go
into
and
is
supported
by
the
findings
of
nara
itself.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
well,
certainly
i
would
agree
with
petitioner
that
there
should
be
a
classification
that
could
keep
these
hardened
criminals
apart
from
the
first
offender,
the
youthful
offender.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes
in
fact
congressman
mcclure
from
state
of
illinois
presented
that
point
of
view
before
the
congress
very
clearly
because
he
pointed
out
that
what
he
was
concerned
with
most
and
felt
that
this
act
would
be
concerned
with
most
would
be
addicts
who
are
primarily,
addicts
and
secondarily,
criminals.
he
also
said
that
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
mix
the
hardened
criminal
with
the
young,
helpless
addict
that
committed
only
one
crime.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
it
is
sir.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
as
i
understand
it
now,
the
nara
people
are
located
primarily
at
milan,
michigan,
denver,
connecticut,
terminal
island,
california
anderson,
west
virginian
and
fort
worth,
texas.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
not
springfield
and
lexington
evidently
is
out
too
although
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
this
act
forth
worth
and
lexington
were
the
two
main
institutions.
this
court
has
so
held
that
it
is
referring
to
the
multiple
offenders
has
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
habitual
offender’s
statute
in
moore
versus
missouri,
graham
versus
west
virginia.
in
the
moore
case
excluding
from
people
versus
stanley,
the
court
said,
“the
punishment
for
the
second
is
increased
because
by
his
persistence
in
the
perpetration
of
crime,
he
has
evinced
state
depravity
which
merits
a
greater
punishment
and
needs
to
be
restrained
by
severe
penalties
than
if
it
were
his
first
offense.”
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
the
graham
was
1912,
moore
was
about
1896.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
moore
is
159
united
states
673
and
graham
is
224
us
616.
and
so
important
is
the
offender's
prior
history
of
criminality
that
most
states
make
a
prison
whose
is
convicted
of
more
than
two
crimes
ineligible
for
probation.
in
many
states
like
wyoming,
only
first
offenders
can
be
granted
or
even
considered
for
probation.
and
on
a
federal
level
we
find
this
is
important
too.
in
the
policy
statement
of
the
drug
abuse
manual
of
april
20th,
1973
issued
by
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons
is
made
clear
that
previous
criminality
and
seriousness
of
offenses
are
reasonable
considerations
in
parole
matters.
in
title
xxiix,
section
2.24
reveals
that
the
united
states
board
of
parole
generally
considers
such
factors
as
an
offender’s
prior
criminal
record,
the
nature
in
the
pattern
of
his
offenses.
thus,
they
have
been
both
judicial
and
legislative
determinations
of
the
rationality
of
the
classifications
in
issue
here.
it’s
neither
irrational
nor
unreasonable
for
congress
to
find
a
second
time
offender
presents
a
greater
risk
to
society
than
a
risk
or
menace
presented
by
the
one
time
offender.
even
nara
with
its
carefully
selected
clientele
has
concluded
that
first
offenders
fair
better
than
repeaters.
in
the
creation
of
statutory
rights,
congress
can
define
the
class
of
persons
that
will
receive
that
benefit
of
the
statutorily
created
right.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes
sir
and
there’s
a
greater
degree
of
success
in
the
community
after
they’re
released
from
the
first
offender
than
from
the
repeater.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
not
--
as
far
as
narcotic
addiction
primarily,
but
even
for
subsequent
crimes
because
the
theory
is
that
most
of
the
people
who
are
convicted
under
nara,
the
only
reason
they
are
guilty
of
a
crime
is
to
support
that
habit
which
is
still
questionable
whether
that’s
true
or
not
but
that’s
the
theory
they
are
going
on
so
the
figured
that
if
they’ve
cured
the
addict
and
he
doesn’t
need
to
steal
in
order
to
support
an
expensive
habit
then
he
can
become
rehabilitated.
and
they
have
found
that
the
first
offender
fairs
better
than
the
repeater
on
both
counts
as
an
addict
and
as
a
criminal.
ms.
jewel
s.
lafontant
yes,
as
our
brief
points
out,
i
think
more
than
half
of
our
argument
is
devoted
to
the
fact
that
this
was
a
pilot
program
initiated.
this
is
the
first
major
act
in
this
area
that
has
been
taken
since
1940.
it
was
recognized
that
very
few
people
really
know
much
about
addiction
and
the
problems
and
the
cures.
it
was
the
beginning
program,
a
pilot
program
they
wanted
something
to
be
done
but
at
the
same
time
they
knew
that
not
only
because
of
lack
of
resources
but
because
of
lack
of
knowledge,
they
weren’t
willing
to
open
it
up
to
the
whole
addict
public.
they
had
to
start
somewhere
and
in
starting
somewhere
they
had
to
draw
classifications
also,
and
this
certainly
would
be
a
reasonable
classification.
since
1966,
many
institutions
have
been
built
and
it
has
included
more
and
more
people
even
now.
they’ve
gone
further
than
just
say
the
hard
addict.
they
treat
people
who
are
on
barbiturates
and
pediments.
but
you’re
perfectly
right,
mr.
chief
justice
that
it
was
a
pilot
program
and
the
line
had
to
be
drawn
somewhere.
we
respectfully
submit
that
drawing
the
line
at
this
point
was
perfectly
reasonable
and
that
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
