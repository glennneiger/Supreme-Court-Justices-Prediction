unknown
speaker
well
that’s
just
the
result
of
being
locked
up
in
a
place
where
there
are
no
narcotics
available,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
you
may
call
a
treatment
if
you
will
but
that
just
happens
to
everybody
who
gets
locked
up
where
there
are
no
narcotics
available.
unknown
speaker
was
the
idea
that
the
double
offenders
are
less
likely
to
be
rehabilitated,
is
that
what
you’re
[voice
overlap]
--
?
unknown
speaker
some
rough
judgment
like
that?
unknown
speaker
mrs.
lafontant
this
is
beside
the
point
but
did
you
know
is
the
institution
of
lexington
still
operating?
unknown
speaker
are
most
of
the
nara
people
sent
there
or
springfield
do
know
this
a
matter
of
routine?
unknown
speaker
what
year
was
moore,
mrs.
lafontant?
unknown
speaker
you
haven’t
cited
that
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
mean
fair
better
that
they
respond
--
first
offender
respond
more
readily
to
treatment
than
to
multiple
offenders?
unknown
speaker
that
is
in
terms
of
the
narcotic
addiction.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
this
full
enterprise
an
experimental
one
as
yet?
unknown
speaker
is
it
the
fact
mr.
hewitt
that
if
one
is
eligible,
the
chances
of
getting
to
the
streets,
if
he
comes
within
title
ii
are
better
than
if
he’s
not
noted
in
title
ii?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
government's
suggestion
that
experience
has
shown
that
the
multiple
offender,
an
addict
who
gets
back
in
the
society
is
more
likely
to
commit
another
crime
than
is
the
single
offender,
also
an
addict
who
is
released.
unknown
speaker
did
you
say
there
are
12
facilities
for
this?
unknown
speaker
are
you
telling
mr.
marshall
is
getting
no
treatment?
unknown
speaker
he
was
not
given
--
suppose
though
he
were
in
a
facility
where
treatment
is
available,
and
they
give
it
to
him?
would
it
be
any
different
from
what
he
would
get
if
committed
under
title
ii?
unknown
speaker
if
marshall
had
got
title
ii
treatment,
would
he
be
where
he
is
now?
unknown
speaker
wouldn’t
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
there
were
no
title
ii
program
and
marshall
was
not
getting
treatment
where
he
now
is
but
other
convicts
in
other
places
or
even
in
this
prison
are
getting
treatment?
unknown
speaker
well,
he’s
among
the
class
that
is
excluded
from
treatment
and
he’s
a
member
of
the
class
and
they
deserve
treatment
as
much
as
the
people
who
are
getting
treatment.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
just
have
reached
the
limit
of
the
program.
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
your
position.
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
do
i
understand
you
to
say,
mr.
hewitt
that
one
in
three
maybe
pilot
programs
but
the
legislative
history
doesn’t
indicate
that
they
regard
the
program
under
title
ii
as
a
pilot
one?
unknown
speaker
and
had
we
had
the
narcotics
treatment
programs
generally
in
the
federal
prison
system
before
we
ever
got
title
ii?
unknown
speaker
well,
can’t
it
be
argued
though
that
as
to
people
and
your
client’s
position
the
choice
of
congress
was
to
punish
rather
than
to
rehabilitate
by
excluding?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
it
can
be
--
certainly,
the
solicitor
general
contends
that
so
far
as
those
who
are
excluded,
the
choice
of
congress
was
in
favor
of
punishment
rather
than
rehabilitation.
unknown
speaker
so,
this
means
they’re
clear
on
the
face
of
the
statute
to
exclude
them
from
the
program?
unknown
speaker
well,
that’s
what
would
follow.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
what’s
the
purpose
of
the
exclusion?
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
united
states,
it
does
have
a
purpose.
unknown
speaker
namely
to
a
--
unknown
speaker
[voice
overlap]
to
leave
this
particular
class
to
the
ordinary
processes
of
the
criminal
law?
unknown
speaker
because
this
special
class
of
defendant
proposing
a
greater
hazard,
that’s
what
the
government
says.
i
didn’t
--
the
same

i’d
agree
with
