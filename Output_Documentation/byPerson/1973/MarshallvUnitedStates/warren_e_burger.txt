chief

e.

we'll
hear
arguments
next
in
72-5881,
marshall
against
the
united
states.
mr.
hewitt,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
[inaudible]
that
point
saying
that
a
district
judge
in
sentencing
would
not
be
permitted
to
take
into
account
prior
criminal
offender?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
is
that
that
precludes
him
from
getting
the
treatment,
the
availability
of
the
facilities
or
are
you
suggesting
he
is
absolutely
barred
from
getting
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
not
--
that’s
not
quite
my
question.
is
--
are
you
suggesting
that
is
a
bar,
some
kind
of
an
absolute
bar
to
his
being
treated
for
his
narcotics
addiction
while
he
is
prison,
in
his
present
sentence
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i’m
sure
no
one
would
challenge
that
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
or
good
sound
policy,
but
the
question
is
whether
that
rises
to
constitutional
level,
isn’t
that
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i’m
sorry,
we’ll
pick
up
with
that
part
first
thing
in
the
morning,
mr.
hewitt.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
continue
the
arguments
in
marshall
against
the
united
states.
mr.
hewitt
you
will
have
17
minutes.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hewitt
excuse
me,
do
you
have
to
go
that
far
or
is
it
enough
for
the
purposes
of
your
case
to
say
that
he
had
a
right
to
put
in
evidence
on
the
subject
to
trigger
the
district
judges’
discretion
in
the
matter?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don’t
claim
an
absolute
right
to
have
rehabilitative
treatment
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
does
the
power
of
congress
to
fix
the
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
constitute
any
kind
of
a
barrier
here
to
what
you’re
driving
at?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
i
understand
that
you
seem
to
concede
the
power
of
congress
to
have
a
distinction
which
permits
the
segregation
of
what
you
called
hardened
criminals
amendments
two,
three,
four
convictions
from
first
offenders
who
are
narcotics
addicts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
hewitt.
mrs.
lafontant.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
isn’t
there
a
six
weeks
period
of
isolation
and
during
which
the
all
incoming
prisoners
are
classified
for
the
wide
range
of
purposes
that
is,
their
health
condition,
their
rehabilitation
prospects
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
is
it
during
this
six
weeks
period
that
they
try
to
find
out
what
the
narcotics
situation
is,
if
they
have
a
one?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
it
there
another
factor
that
is
the
mixing
of
first
offenders
with
men
who
got
two,
three
or
four
convictions
while
they’re
trying
to
rehabilitate
these
offenders
with
only
a
single
felony?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
didn’t
congress
have
that
mind
in
separating
people
with
more
than
two
felony
convictions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
certainly
not
springfield.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hewitt,
would
you
agree
in
broad
terms
that
nobody
really
knows
very
much
about
addiction
and
that
there
is
not
even
yet
any
medical
certainty
that
anybody
can
be
fully
rehabilitated?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
those
the
institutions
which
they
commit
title
ii?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
do
you
mean
by
treatment?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
quite
a
number
of
statutes
in
states
and
i
think
there’s
some
in
the
federal
which
make
it
mandatory
for
particular
sentence
after
either
one
conviction
or
two
convictions
that
takes
the
discretion
from
the
sentencing
judge
in
the
same
way,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
in
the
federal
system,
is
there
not
a
requirement
that
there
will
be
a
five
year
minimum
after
the
second
conviction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
could
you
have
as
a
premise
that
these
people
are
similarly
situated
but
is
the
man
with
three
or
four
felony
convictions
in
the
same
situations
as
a
person
who
has
never
had
any
prior
convictions?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
then
we
come
back
to
the
proposition
of
whether
it’s
a
reasonable
classification
for
congress
to
make,
i
guess
don’t
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
hewitt,
you
came
here
at
our
request
by
the
appointment
of
this
court

you.
chief
justice
warren
e.

the
case
is
submitted.
chief

you,
