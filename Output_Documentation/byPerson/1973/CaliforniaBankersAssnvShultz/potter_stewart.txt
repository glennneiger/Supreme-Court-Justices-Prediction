justice
potter
stewart
is
that
your
--
your
mistaken
i
think
if
you
say
that
dividends
are
deductible
by
the
corporations,
they're
not
and
that’s
enlisting
the
services
of
the
corporation
to
monitor
tax
payers,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
is
enlisting
a
corporation
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
to
check
on
the
tax
returns
of
its
shareholders,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
are
you
the
(inaudible)
one
of
the
parties
to
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
it
is
represented
as
you
know
that
as
a
practical
matter
that
exception
is
virtually
meaningless
because
microfilming
equipment
can’t
distinguish
between
a
check
under
a
$100.00
and
check
over
a
$100.00
and
that
the
manpower
required
to
separate
them
would
not
be
worth
the
candle
and
that
therefore
as
a
practical
matter
its
a
meaningless
distinction,
a
meaningless
exemption,
if
you
will
and
i
personally
don’t
know
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
that’s
about.
is
there
anything
in
the
record
about
that?
justice
potter
stewart
it
would
be
possible
to
do.i
mean
a
human
being
could
easily
do
it
but
you’d
--
the
representation
is
that
that
would
add
so
much
expense
it
would
--
its
--
that
is
therefore
as
a
practical
matter
cheaper
to
microfilm
them
all.
justice
potter
stewart
nobody
could
quarrel
with
the
proposition
that
is
possible
--
justice
potter
stewart
you
could
sue
him
i
suppose
on
a
capitalistic
system
that
whatever
the
cost
of
doing
business
are,
that
will
be
paid
for
by
the
bank's
costumers
ultimately
and
the
bank
will
continue
to
make
what
profit
it
can
make
in
a
competitive
economy,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
maybe
they’ve
been
able
to
economize
somewhere
else.
justice
potter
stewart
when
was
that
brief
filed?
does
it
--
got
a
date
in
the
front
of
it,
a
stamp?
justice
potter
stewart
we
have
a
white
one
--
justice
potter
stewart
filed
january
2nd.
justice
potter
stewart
so
what
page
now?
justice
potter
stewart
there's
no
--
the
statute
is
unambiguous
and
what
it
requires
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
that
the
executive
branch
has
chosen
to
disregard
it.
so
it
would
be
like
one
of
these
incumbent
cases,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
both?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it's
for
both
language
that
we’re
talking
about.
justice
potter
stewart
in
the
brief?
justice
potter
stewart
but
that’s
not
--
one
of
the
purposes
of
this
provision
contained
in
the
house
report
certainly
is
not
served
because
--
is
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
because
this
does
enable
the
bank
to
give
this
information
to
the
internal
revenue
without
any
knowledge
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
its
costumer,
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
precisely
what
the
house
report
said
that
the
requirement
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
designed
to
forestall.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
house
committee
talked
about
the
risk
of
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
putting
pressure
on
the
bank
to
give
it
--
this
information
without
informing
its
costumers.
justice
potter
stewart
no,
but
that
risk
--
but
that
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
is
--
exist
under
the
regulations.
that’s
why
there
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
hadn’t
been
my
understanding
that
you
were
arguing
that
this
legislation
was
beyond
the
constitutional
power
of
congress
to
enact
under
the
commerce
power,
but
rather
that
it
violated
specific
provisions
of
the
bill
of
rights,
i.e.
the
fourth
or
fifth
amendment.
justice
potter
stewart
isn't
that
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
have
not
misapprehended
your
argument,
have
i?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
or
the

power?
justice

is

your
