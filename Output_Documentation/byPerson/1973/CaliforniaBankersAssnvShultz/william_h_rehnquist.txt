justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn’t
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice’s
question
solve
at
least
a
good
part
of
vagueness
problem
since
if
you
don’t
try
to
come
within
the
exemption,
the
bank
is
perfectly
free
to
report
all
transactions.
it
doesn’t
have
to
rely
on
the
normal
exception?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn’t
that
at
least
solve
your
vagueness
arguments
so
far
as
the
exception
is
concerned?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
the
bank
of
america
keep
the
original
check
for
a
longer
period
of
time
than
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh!
that’s
right.
the
drawer
--
should
the
drawer
gets
the
check,
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
argu
--
what
is
the
argument
--
what
constitutional
is
--
provision
is
violated
if
it
--
it
falls
under
that
first
attack
that
you
make?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
--
but
what
provision
of
the
constitution
does
that
violate?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
--
how
about
the
irs
requirement
that
you
notify,
the
government
of
everybody
you
paid
dividends
to
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
marson,
are
you
now
arguing
your
challenge
to
the
reporting
regulations
as
well
as
to
the
recording
--
recordkeeping
regulation?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
have
any
of
your
clients
engaged
in
transactions
which
they
would
be
required
to
report
or
had
they
at
the
time,
the
filing
of
the
complaint?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
a
small
bank
would
use
something
other
than
microfilm?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
i
do
have
one
more
question
about
the
recordkeeping
provisions.
i
get
the
impression
from
your
argument
that
there
was
--
at
least
some
testimony
before
congress
to
the
effect
that
banks
were
shifting
away
from
retaining
these
records.
the
reason
i
ask
is
because
my
own
experience
in
private
practice
is
just
what
justice
white
and
justice
powell
intimated
in
their
questions
that
i
can’t
remember
ever
having
any
trouble
subpoenaing
a
check
record
from
a
bank.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
my
own
little
locale,
they
kept
them
several
years.
so,
was
this
in
effect
an
effort
by
congress
to
see
that
a
--
what
had
been
an
adequate
voluntary
system
was
preserved
when
there
was
an
impetuous
to
turn
away
from
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
clarify
for
me
what
the
term
currency
transaction
means,
mr.
wallace?
can
you
give
an
example?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
red
covered
brief?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
might
not
the
bank
themselves
become
kind
of
anxious
to
supply
the
information
without
having
the
costumer
cooperate.
in
other
words,
it
might
be
a
two-sided
end-runner
on
the
costumer
so
to
speak.
the
banks
would
probably
prefer
to
furnish
it
without
having
to
serve
a
copy
on
the
costumer
so
that
a
costumer
doesn’t
get
its
--
see
it
and
say,
you
know,
what's
my
bank
done
to
me?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
isn’t
any
police
power
in
congress,
all
of
congress
is
criminal
statutes
are
based
on
the
commerce
power?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
the
taxing
power.
congress
doesn’t
have
any
police
powers.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
but
the
--
it
wouldn’t
wipe
out
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
objections,
but
i
don’t
see
that
the
telephone
notion
is
particularly
objectionable
on
the
commerce
clause
grounds.
it
seems
to
me
that
in
response
to
justice
stewart’s
question,
you
say,
you’re
arguing
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
restrictions
rather
than
lack
of
affirmative
authority
under
commerce?
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
these
appeals
raise
various
questions
concerning
the
constitutionality
of
the
bank
secrecy
act
of
1970.
that
act
of
the
implementing
regulations,
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
the
treasury,
requires
in
title
i
that
certain
financial
institutions
maintain
records
of
their
customers’
identities
and
make
copies
of
certain
checks
and
other
instruments;
title
ii
of
the
act
requires
the
reporting
of
certain
foreign
and
domestic
financial
transactions.
the
act
requires
reports
of
the
transportation
of
currency
and
specified
instruments
exceeding
$5,000
in
value
into
or
out
of
the
united
states.
the
act
also
requires
the
reporting
by
financial
institutions
of
transactions
in
currencies
in
amounts
exceeding
$10,000.
suits
were
brought
in
the
district
court
by
various
plaintiffs
including
individual
depositors
of
bank,
the
american
civil
liberties
union
and
the
california
banker
association,
challenging
the
act
on
first,
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
grounds.
the
three-judge
district
court
which
was
connived
to
hear
these
challenges
upheld
the
recordkeeping
provisions
of
title
i
and
the
foreign
reporting
provision
of
title
ii.
the
district
court
concluded,
however,
that
the
domestic
reporting
provisions
contravene
the
fourth
amendment
and
enjoin
their
enforcement.
in
a
53-page
opinion,
which
i
can’t
possible
do
justice
to
orally,
which
we
filed
today,
we
agree
with
the
district
court
that
the
recordkeeping
provisions
of
the
act,
as
implemented
by
the
regulations,
violate
no
constitutional
right
of
any
of
the
plaintiffs
below.
we
similarly
agree
with
the
district
court
that
to
the
extent
that
the
individual
plaintiffs
below
had
standing,
they
did
not
present
a
constitutional
claim
for
the
relief
against
any
of
the
foreign
reporting
requirements.
finally
we
hold
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
striking
down
the
domestic
reporting
requirement
as
violative
of
the
fourth
amendment.
we
hold
that
the
domestic
reporting
requirements
violate
no
fourth
amendment
right
of
the
banks
to
make
the
reports.
in
addition,
we
hold
that
the
depositor
plaintiffs
below
made
insufficient
allegations
of
engagement
in
domestic
currency
transactions
to
challenge
the
domestic
reporting
provisions.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
is
affirmed
on
the
appeal
of
the
banks
and
depositor
plaintiffs
and
reversed
on
the
government’s
appeal
and
remanded
for
disposition
consistent
with
the
opinion
filed
today.

justice
powell
