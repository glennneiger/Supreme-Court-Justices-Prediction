mr.
charles
c.
marson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
be
happy
to
enlarge
on
that
point.
there
is
one
essential
difference
between
all
of
the
recordkeeping
and
reporting
statutes
mentioned
so
far
in
the
bank
secrecy
act
and
that
is
that
this
one
is
in
aid
of
criminal
law
enforcement
and
all
the
others
are
in
aid
of
civil
law
enforcement.
perhaps,
first
i
should
say
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
well
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
it
can
be
tangentially
useful
to
the
criminal
law
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
--
but
its
basic
purpose
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
--
purpose
is
to
enforce
the
civil
tax.
in
shapiro
versus
thompson
for
example,
the
required
records
were
primarily
in
aid
of
a
civil
regulatory
system.
in
shapiro
they
were
used
for
a
criminal
purpose
but
they
were
primarily
in
aid
of
some
--
of
a
civil
system.
in
united
states
versus
sullivan
in
1927,
this
court
held
that
one
could
not
refuse
to
give
it
--
a
tax
return
on
the
grounds
of
self-incrimination
because
its
purpose
was
to
collect
--
it
was
neutral,
it
was
a
--
direct
to
the
population
at
large.
its
purpose
was
to
collect
civil
information
for
the
tax.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
certainly
they
do
but
not
a
primarily
and
almost
exclusively
criminal
one,
no.
if
this
court
permits
reports
and
records
to
be
kept
and
compelled
in
aid
of
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law,
it
abolishes
its
supervisorial
duty
over
subpoenas
and
summonses
and
the
power
of
the
government
to
compel
documents
from
anybody
except
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
that’s
an
example
of
the
regulation
both
of
the
seller
and
of
the
buyer.
my
interpretation
of
what
mr.
anders
--
the
categories
in
which
mr.
anderson
put
these
previously
existing
laws
were
--
is
a
little
bit
different,
i
would
say
that
all
this
preexisting
laws
regulate
other
than
the
record
keeper,
the
record
keeper’s
costumer
or
the
record
keeper’s
costumer’s
tax
liability
for
example
in
his
relationship
to
the
record
keeper.
the
donaldson
case
is
a
good
example
where
they
subpoenaed
the
records
of
the
employees,
former
employer
and
the
former
employer’s
account
in
order
to
check
on
the
tax
liability
of
the
employee.
that
was
a
record
kept
by
the
record
keeper
which
was
relevant
to
tax
liability
of
the
subject
to
the
records,
but
only
out
of
the
relationship
between
the
two
whereas
the
record
kept
a
--
mr.
justice
brennan’s
hypothetical
$15,000.00
check,
is
a
record
directed
to
the
relationship
between
him
and
some
fourth
party
of
whom
criminality
may
be
suspected.
i
think
i
should
back
up
a
little
bit
and
identify
the
somewhat
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
if
i
tend
to
do
that,
any
record
keeping
requirement
might
tend
in
some
cases
to
evidence
criminality,
but
one
which
is
for,
“the
purpose,”
and
i
am
quoting
the
government’s
brief
of
enforcing
the
criminal
law
is
a
wholly
different
animal
than
one
which
is
for
the
primary
purpose
of
enforcing
the
civil
law
and
has
tangential
criminal
consequences.
the
government
doesn’t
disagree
that
compelling
a
report
as
opposed
to
the
keeping
of
the
record,
is
a
search
and
seizure
governed
by
the
fourth
amendment.
it
doesn’t
disagree
that
it
is
the
criminal
law
for
which
these
are
largely
compelled,
but
it
does
not
explain
why
the
warrant
requirement
has
no
application
here
while
there
is
no
judicial
supervision
whatsoever
over
these
reports.
it
doesn’t
explain
why
it
is
abolished,
not
only
the
requirement
of
probable
cause,
but
even
the
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
to
which?
i’m
afraid
i
don’t
understand
your
question.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
now,
i
rep
--
i
think
i
should
inform
the
court
as
to
who
it
is
that
i
represent
here.
i
represent
congressman
stark,
a
bank
costumer,
other
foreign
and
domestic
bank
costumers,
the
security
national
bank
and
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
yes,
i
also
represent
one
foreign
or
four
foreign
investors
who
must
affirmatively
report
their
holdings
and
their
transactions
across
the
border
and
analytically
we
feel
the
foreign
and
domestic
reporting
requirements
are
constitutionally
the
same
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
we
are
arguing
them
both.
frankly
from
a
constitutional
point
of
view,
we
think
the
record
keeping
requirements
are
a
little
more
frightful
even
than
the
reporting
requirements.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
well,
the
fourth
amendment
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
i
as
a
lawyer
representing
clients
who
must
report
--
object
to
the
reports.
i,
representing
bank
costumers
whose
records
are
kept
under
the
coercion
of
the
act
object
to
the
keeping
of
the
records.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
because
they
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
combined
and
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
certainly
it
does
and
it
already
does
then
its
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
it
does.
and
we
have
no
complaint
directed
to
any
record
which
the
bank
keeps
in
its
own
business
judgment
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
we
do
when
it
is
coerced
by
the
government
and
not
relevant
to
the
business
purposes
of
the
bank,
then
and
only
then
do
we
object.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
if,
but
for
the
act,
the
record
would
not
be
made
or
kept,
then
we
object
to
it.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
because
the
bank
acts
as
agent
of
the
government
in
doing
that
because
its
irrelevant
to
the
regulatory
purpose
and
because
it
constitutes
a
search.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
the
bank
as
a
matter
of
practice
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
yes,
we
would
because
the
banks
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
no.
because
the
banks
are
not
keeping
as
many
records
as
long
as
the
bank
secrecy
act
coerces
them
to
do.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
we
have
no
objection
to
records
kept
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business,
none
at
all.
these
are
not
kept
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business.
they
are
kept
under
the
coercion
of
the
act.
the
act
was
passed
for
the
purpose
of
coercing
the
keeping
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
no,
it's
one
of
our
points.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
if
we
win,
we’ll
give
up
the
ones
that
we
don’t
need,
yes.[laughter]
we
object
only
to
the
records
that
wouldn’t
be
there,
but
for
the
act
not
for
the
records
that
would
be
there
in
the
exercise
of
the
business
judgment
of
the
bank,
for
example,
to
protect
itself
from
suit,
for
example,
to
verify
a
statement
that
came
back
to
the
costumer.
those,
we
have
no
problem
with.
only
when
we
pass
the
point
of
business
judgment
and
enter
area
of
records
not
made
or
kept
but
for
the
act,
do
we
have
a
constitutional
objection.
we
feel
that
those
--
that
enters
the
area
of
agency
that
once
the
bank
passes
out
of
its
business
and
regulatory
function
and
enters
into
its
unwilling
function
as
keeping
records
as
essentially
a
surveillance
mechanism
for
the
government,
then
they're
acting
in
agency
role.
the
government’s
only
answer
to
that
is
to
quote
mr.
justice
white’s
opinion
in
united
states
versus
white
and
say
it’s
just
like
a
willing
informant
receiving
information
from
a
willing
confidant
and
turning
it
over
to
the
government.
we
think
that
analogy
has
no
merit
at
all.
in
the
first
place,
the
banks
here,
as
their
presence
in
court
testifies
are
not
willing
informants
to
the
government.
they
object
to
the
requirement,
they
go
to
jail
if
they
don’t
fulfill
it.
in
the
second,
it
is
by
no
means
voluntary
for
the
bank
costumer
to
deal
with
the
bank
in
the
sense
it
is
for
mr.
hoff
ought
to
deal
with
the
informant
or
mr.
white
to
deal
with
the
informant
in
those
two
decisions.
the
government
basically
says
that
if
you
know
these
people
are
agencies
of
the
government,
something
not
known,
in
aurthur
and
white,
your
choice
is
to
keep
dealing
with
them
and
will
call
that
voluntary
or
to
give
up
banking
and
for
that
matter
financial
institutions
entirely.
you
may
carry
your
cash
to
everybody
you
owe
money
to
even
if
it’s
the
other
end
of
the
country
or
you
may
deal
voluntarily
with
the
agent
of
the
bank.
we
think
that
that
distorts
the
meaning
of
the
term
voluntary
beyond
all
recognition
and
that
is
the
only
answer
the
government
has
to
our
theory
that
when
a
bank
makes
or
keeps
a
record,
it
would
not
otherwise
make
or
keep
in
its
business
judgment,
it
acts
as
an
agent
of
the
government.
if
it
does
that
then
analytically,
there
is
no
difference
between
the
required
reports
and
the
required
records
because
the
search
of
the
records
has
to
be
measured
as
of
the
time
the
agent
of
the
government,
i.e.
the
bank,
acts
and
copies
the
record.
now,
there
is
solid
precedent
aside
from
this
agency
theory
for
equating
the
constitutional
effect
of
the
recordkeeping
and
the
reporting.
it's
found
in
marchetti
versus
united
states.
there,
the
court
on
rehearing
asked
the
parties
to
brief
the
question
of
the
effect
of
shapiro
versus
united
states
and
the
government
repeatedly
insisted
in
its
brief
that
there
was
no
application
to
marchetti
of
shapiro
because
shapiro
involved
records
and
marchetti
involved
reports.
in
footnote
14
of
mr.
justice
harlan’s
opinion
in
that
case,
he
said,
“the
court
finds
no
meaningful
distinction
between
the
two.”
now
in
shapiro,
a
subpoena
was
issued
for
the
records
that
were
required
to
be
kept,
issued
to
a
party
who
had
adversary
interest
in
contesting
that
subpoena.
here,
the
situation
is
worse
because
the
subpoena
issues
to
a
bank
that
has
no
such
adversary
interest.
the
bank
as
a
matter
of
general
practice
frequently,
especially
in
violation
of
its
higher
level
policy
by
lower
level
employees
gives
law
enforcement
what
they
ask
for
without
a
summons.
even
if
they
get
a
summons,
they
put
it
in
the
file
and
turn
the
material
over.
the
government
does
not
deny
this
--
these
facts,
the
legislative
history
makes
them
perfectly
plain.
people
simply
do
not
get
a
chance
to
contest
subpoenas
directed
to
their
bank
account
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events.
even
if
they
do,
the
government’s
reading
of
couch
and
donaldson
would
give
no
standing
to
the
parties
to
assert
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
rights
should
that
subpoena
ever
be
discovered
by
them
in
time
to
litigate
it.
under
our
reading
of
course,
the
costumer
does
have
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
interest
in
records
not
otherwise
made
or
kept
in
the
business
judgment
of
the
bank
and
would
under
couch
and
donaldson
have
standing
to
object.
but
even
that
would
not
avail
the
costumer
a
very
much.
let’s
suppose
that
i
am
prosecuted
on
the
basis
of
a
copy
of
a
check
subpoenaed
from
my
bank.
the
government
says,
“well,
it
will
be
time
enough
for
you
to
raise
your
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
objections
when
you
are
prosecuted
on
the
basis
of
the
check.”
what
would
i
have
to
prove?
i
would
have
to
prove
that
in
the
ordinary
business
practice
of
my
bank,
the
check
would
not
have
been
copied
and
it
was,
but
for
the
act
that
the
check
was
copied.
now,
since
ordinary
business
practice
stopped
--
practice
stopped
in
july
1,
1972
when
this
regulations
went
into
effect
and
since
they
went
into
effect
because
of
rapid
technological
change
as
the
years
go
by,
that
burden
of
proof
changes
from
very
difficult
which
it
is
now
to
impossible
which
it
will
be
in
a
few
years.
next,
the
government
says,
“well,
you
have
time
enough
to
raise
these
objections
when
you're
prosecuted
or
otherwise
proceeded
against
without
paying
any
attention
to
the
relief
we
ask
here.
if
i
successfully
suppress
that
check,
all
i
get
is
the
suppression
of
one
check.
we
ask
here
for
the
invalidation
of
the
act.
but
finally
and
most
important
when
the
government
says
that
it
is
time
--
time
enough
when
the
subpoena
is
served
in
your
bank,
should
you
luck
--
be
lucky
enough
to
find
out
about
it
and
litigate
it.
to
litigate
these
questions,
it
ignores
the
difference
between
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
exclusionary
rule.
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
quite
correctly
in
this
opinion
for
the
court
in
u.s.
v.
robinson
only
last
month,
virtually
all
of
this
court’s
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
has
arisen
since
weeks
versus
united
states
and
in
the
context
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
this
is
one
of
the
rare
and
happy
cases
in
which
you
have
innocent
parties
before
you
asking
for
the
protection
of
privacy
afforded
by
the
fourth
amendment.
the
government
saying
that
we’re
premature
in
this
case
because
we
haven’t
been
preceded
against
ignores
the
fact
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty
to
invert
an
old
phrase,
and
ignores
the
fact
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
privacy,
not
guilty
secrets.
and
so
we
are
not
prematurely
here
even
assuming
that
we
get
notice
of
a
subpoena
of
our
bank
account,
even
assuming
we
could
litigate
all
this
questions
under
couch
and
donaldson,
now
is
the
time,
perhaps
the
only
time
in
which
these
issues
can
be
decided.
finally,
there
is
a
connection
between
the
fourth
amendment
and
fifth
amendment
which
makes
the
separation
of
them
by
the
government,
we
think
indefensible
in
the
case.
this
court
has
not
had
a
majority
for
what
boyd
versus
united
states
means
with
respect
to
the
intimate
connection
between
the
two
amendments.
since
boyd
was
decided
in
1886,
mr.
justice
marshall’s
exploration
of
the
several
different
interpretations
of
that
intimate
relationship
in
his
dissent
in
the
couch
case
throws
some
light
on
the
issues
here.
but
i
think
to
quote
mr.
justice
frankfurter
when
he
was
writing
for
the
court
in
frank
versus
maryland
later
overruled,
in
some
excellent
dictum,
he
said,
“it
is
not
necessary
to
accept
any
particular
theory
of
the
interrelationship
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment.
to
understand
what
lies,
not
at
its
periphery
but
at
its
core,
self-protection,
self-protection
of
a
party
from
being
compelled
to
create
and
produce
evidence
against
himself.
the
central
purpose,
the
purpose
as
the
government
calls
it,
of
the
bank
secrecy
act,
is
to
force
private
citizens
to
create
and
deliver
to
the
government
or
hold
for
its
later
obtaining
by
means
of
judicial
process
or
otherwise,
evidence
of
crime,
their
own
or
someone
else’s.
now,
if
the
government
told
everybody,
told
private
citizens
to
keep
watch
on
their
neighbor,
record
their
comings
and
goings,
report
anything
unusual
that
would
be
different
from
this
case
only
in
the
fact
that
they
were
speaking
to
private
citizens
not
regulated
industries.
the
government
here
argues
that
the
difference
is
constitutionally
critical
because
it
has
plenary
regulatory
power
over
banks,
it
can
order
banks
for
purposes
foreign
to
that
power
to
keep
watch
over
its
costumers
and
their
relation
with
still
other
fourth
parties
in
order
to
enforce
the
criminal
law.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
yes,
in
our
view
they're
constitutional
and
distinguishable.
the
reporting
requirements
are
easier
because
they're
an
outright
seizure.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
they
alleged
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint
which
was
a
few
weeks
before
the
effective
date
of
the
act
that
they
had
done
so
in
the
recent
past
and
would
do
so
in
the
immediate
future,
and
therefore,
we’re
under
the
effect
of
the
regulation.
i
have
four
clients,
lieberman,
harwood,
bruer,
and
durell,
all
of
whom
are
required
to
report
their
folder
--
their
foreign
holdings.
lieberman
sends
monetary
instruments
in
excess
of
$5,000.00
across
the
border.
lieberman
and
the
three
others
all
have
financial
interest
in
or
signature
authority
over
foreign
bank
accounts.
as
such,
they
are
required
affirmatively
to
report
those
of
the
government
and
have
been
doing
so
because
the
district
court
declined
to
enjoin
that
portion
of
the
act.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
yes,
i
am.
it
was
easier
to
verify
the
complaint.
and
finally,
i
might
mention
a
word
before
my
first
section
of
time
runs
out
about
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
the
government
is
willing
to
agree
that
we
have
a
right
to
protect
our
membership
list.
it
is
willing
to
agree
that
this
case
creates
a
membership
list.
it
is
willing
to
agree
that
a
frequently
for
law
enforcement
purposes
has
access
to
bank
records
without
any
process
at
all.
it
is
willing
to
agree
that
even
if
it
serves
the
process,
that
process,
usually
it
is
not
learned
about
by
the
costumer
and
still
it
says
that
we
are
prematurely
here
that
we
must
again
wait
for
some
summons
or
subpoena
to
be
served
upon
us.
we
submit
that
a
nationwide
known
scheme
of
the
collection
of
membership
lists
in
the
hands
of
a
third
party
with
no
instinct
or
interest
in
litigating
is
too
much
of
an
exposure
of
that
membership
list
to
be
tolerated
under
the
first
amendment.
the
d.c.
circuit’s
decision
in
united
states
servicemen’s
fund
turns
on
exactly
that
point.
it
was
the
lack
of
a
litigative
in
a
third
party
who
is
holding
the
records
that
gave
the
united
states
serving
--
servicemen’s
funds
standing
to
intervene
to
seek
the
sort
of
equitable
relief
that
we
seek
here.
if
it
please
the
court,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i’ll
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
the
organization
would
have
to
be
of
the
type
that
was
controversial
and
whose
members
could
reasonably
plead
that
they
could
expect
retaliation
or
exposure.
it
would
have
to
come
under
the
rules
set
forth
in
for
example,
naacp
versus
alabama.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
any
group
who
had
a
reasonable
interest
in
the
privacy
of
its
membership
list
would.
any
group
who
didn’t
care
about
the
maintenance
of
that
privacy
and
didn’t
care
because
it
wouldn’t
affect
first
amendment
rights
but
not
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
because
the
check
goes
through
our
account
and
the
bank
makes
pictures
of
our
account
mr.
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
oh!
well,
if
his
own
bank
takes
a
picture
of
his
check
and
its
written
up
to
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
because
he
knows
that
his
bank
is
going
to
keep
a
record
of
the
fact
that
he
paid
money
to
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
no.
only
checks
that
illustrate
on
their
face
that
they
are
payable
to
us.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
choice
of
adjectives
such
as
restrained
is
of
course
largely
up
to
the
user.
we
do
not
think
that
the
surveillance
of
two
hundred
million
bank
accounts
which
is
how
many
there
are
in
this
country
is
restrained.
we
do
not
think
that
the
copies
--
copying
of
in
excess
of
20
billion
checks
a
year
which
is
how
many
clear
their
makers
banks
in
this
country
every
year
is
restrained.
even
if
we
assume
that
every
bank
in
the
country
pays
the
extra
money
to
sort
out
the
checks
that
are
under
a
hundred
dollars
and
not
copy
them.
by
the
government’s
own
statistic,
that
reduces
the
number
by
90%
down
to
2
billion
checks
every
year.
we
do
not
think
that
is
restrained
either,
but
we
do
not
think
that
if
the
constitution
permits
the
copying
of
checks
over
a
hundred
dollars
simply
because
they're
over
a
hundred
dollars
then
that
makes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
they
do
but
not
in
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law.
and
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
often
used,
yes.
and
this
court
has
had
an
occasion
to
deal
with
the
difficult
problem
where
the
tax
law
and
the
criminal
law
meet
in
a
grey
area
and
it
becomes
a
bleeder's
option
in
the
hands
of
the
irs.
this
is
not
such
a
case.
the
government
began
this
case.
it's
opening
brief
crossed
with
ours
in
the
mail.
both
briefs
claimed
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law.
apparently
when
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
yes
we
do.
we
think
that
the
analogy
to
our
customs
declaration
is
slightly
ridiculous.
the
form
on
which
these
transactions
have
to
be
reported
requires
such
things
as
agency
if
a
--
if
an
instrument
is
transported
not
physically
across
the
border,
but
through
the
first
class
mails,
it
still
has
to
be
reported
and
if
you
do
it
for
someone
else,
you
have
to
name
him,
give
this
address
and
give
his
business
or
occupation.
that’s
not
like
a
customs
declaration.
i
can
bring
a
bottle
of
scotch
from
heathrow
airport
and
i
may
have
to
declare
it
but
i
don’t
have
to
say,
who
i’m
giving
it
to.
there's
a
great
deal
more
information
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
that
i
do
it
for
the
purpose
of
giving
it
to
someone
else?
mr.
charles
c.
marson
i
was
unaware
of
that
your
honor.
do
i
have
to
list
the
other
persons
profession
and
business,
i
doubt
that.
the
government
says
in
its
own
brief
that
the
purpose
of
these
reports
is
to
supply
leads
to
see
which
record
should
be
subpoenaed
or
summoned
which
i
think
has
a
slightly
different
cast
on
it.
the
government
and
we
all
claim
that
criminal
law
enforcement
was
the
central
purpose
of
this
legislation
in
our
opening
briefs.
then
in
its
appellee’s
brief
the
government
as
it
does
here
takes
a
slightly
different
provision
--
position
that
this
is
being
done
pursuant
to
the
regulatory
power
of
congress
over
banks.
now
everywhere,
the
legislative
history
of
course
does
not
support
that
and
the
government
doesn’t
claim
that
it
does,
everywhere
the
act
exempts
transactions
that
have
to
do
with
banks.
an
intra
bank
transaction
is
nowhere
required
to
be
reported
or
recorded.
transactions
between
two
banks,
unless
there
are
customers
involved
do
not
have
to
be
recorded
or
reported.
a
good
illustration
of
how
little
this
has
to
do
with
the
regulation
of
banks
is
this.
my
client,
security
national
bank
could
tomorrow
give
mr.
anderson’s
client
the
bank
of
america
$15
billion
dollars
in
used
hundred
dollar
bills
and
as
far
the
bank
secrecy
act
is
concerned
they
wouldn’t
even
have
to
write
it
down
let
alone
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
well,
their
own
ledger
sheets
has
between
them
would
disclose
the
transaction,
but
they
would
not
have
to
report
that
under
the
bank
secrecy
act
and
i
don’t
know
that
they
would
have
to
report
it
under
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
c.
marson
no,
not
under
this
act.
my
point
is
the
bank
secrecy
act
as
opposed
to
some
other
act
of
congress
has
nothing
to
do
with
those
kinds
of
transactions.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
regulation
of
banks.
so
to
support
the
bank
secrecy
act
as
opposed
to
the
federal
reserve
act
on
the
theory
that
is
a
regulation
of
commerce
is
wholly
unjustifiable
in
this
case.
of
course,
the
federal
reserve
act
is
a
legitimate
regulation
of
commerce
and
that
is
not
challenged
here.
the
bank
secrecy
act
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
regulation
of
banking.
the
analogy
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
actually
it
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
in
terms
of
its
purpose
it
ought
to
be
comprehended
as
an
exercise
as
a
police
power.
it
happens
to
be
used
as
a
means
its
plenary
regulatory
power
over
the
banks.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
let
me
offer
this
analogy
of
the
interplay
of
these
powers
to
the
fourth
amendment.
the
congress
has
every
bit
of
the
plenary
power
over
the
telephone
company
as
it
does
over
the
banks.
if
tomorrow
somebody
invented
the
technology
to
record
all
calls
and
if
the
day
after
congress
passed
an
act
called
the
telephone
secrecy
act
which
required
them
to
do
so
and
then
the
solicitor
general
defended
the
act
on
the
ground
that
the
government
had
plenary
regulatory
power
over
the
telephone
company
and
that
the
parties
who
were
engaged
in
those
calls
had
no
interest
in
those
calls
that
they
were
third
party
business
records,
that
they
were
not
reached
under
couch
and
donaldson,
then
that
theory
which
is
identical
to
this
theory
except
the
technology
isn’t
here
yet,
then
that
theory
would
wipe
out
katz
and
burger
and
u.s.
v.
u.s.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
i
agree
with
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
for
the
purpose
that
you’ve
stated,
it
would
not
but
nobody
claims
here
except
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
well,
certainly
the
fourth
amendment
does
as
this
court
has
frequently
decided.
it
is
the
suggestion
of
the
government
that
--
because
they
serve
multiple
purposes
here
that
the
criminal
law
aspect
of
this
legislation
can
be
ignored
notwithstanding
its
primacy
in
the
legislative
history,
in
the
act
and
then
government’s
opening
brief.
the
suggestion
is
that
because
this
act
serves
all
legal
purposes
at
once,
it
therefore
can
be
justified
by
reference
to
all
regulatory
purposes
at
once.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
constitutes
an
abandonment
of
judicial
supervision
over
the
scope
of
the
government’s
power
to
require
records.
take
for
example,
section
6001
of
the
tax
code.
that’s
the
section
under
which
the
tax
authorities
already
have
plenary
power
to
require
such
records
and
to
require
such
statements
which
is
the
equivalent
of
reports
as
are
necessary
to
assess
the
tax
liability
of
any
person.
that
was
not
enough
to
support
what
has
been
enacted
here.
this
court
in
measuring
a
subpoena
under
7602
of
the
tax
code
could
measure
the
purpose
of
the
subpoena,
i.e.
the
enforcement
of
tax
liability
in
the
specific
context
of
the
purpose
of
taxation
against
the
scope
and
necessity
in
showing
made
for
the
subpoena
because
there
is
a
referent,
there
is
a
specific
purpose
to
be
fulfilled.
when
specific
purposes
are
abandoned
and
the
whole
of
enforceable
law
becomes
the
end-product,
a
piece
of
legislation,
then
that
means
that
the
referent,
the
measuring
stick
for
the
reasonableness
of
a
search
for
an
order
to
produce
documents
is
gone.
if
congress
can
enforce
all
purposes
at
once,
it
is
implicit
in
the
solicitor
general’s
argument
that
the
enforcement
of
those
purposes
knows
no
limit
because
they
are
of
purpose.
that
we
think
is
an
essentially
dangerous
notion
to
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
be
happy
to
enlarge
on
that
point.
there
is
one
essential
difference
between
all
of
the
recordkeeping
and
reporting
statutes
mentioned
so
far
in
the
bank
secrecy
act
and
that
is
that
this
one
is
in
aid
of
criminal
law
enforcement
and
all
the
others
are
in
aid
of
civil
law
enforcement.
perhaps,
first
i
should
say
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
well
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
it
can
be
tangentially
useful
to
the
criminal
law
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
--
but
its
basic
purpose
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
--
purpose
is
to
enforce
the
civil
tax.
in
shapiro
versus
thompson
for
example,
the
required
records
were
primarily
in
aid
of
a
civil
regulatory
system.
in
shapiro
they
were
used
for
a
criminal
purpose
but
they
were
primarily
in
aid
of
some
--
of
a
civil
system.
in
united
states
versus
sullivan
in
1927,
this
court
held
that
one
could
not
refuse
to
give
it
--
a
tax
return
on
the
grounds
of
self-incrimination
because
its
purpose
was
to
collect
--
it
was
neutral,
it
was
a
--
direct
to
the
population
at
large.
its
purpose
was
to
collect
civil
information
for
the
tax.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
certainly
they
do
but
not
a
primarily
and
almost
exclusively
criminal
one,
no.
if
this
court
permits
reports
and
records
to
be
kept
and
compelled
in
aid
of
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law,
it
abolishes
its
supervisorial
duty
over
subpoenas
and
summonses
and
the
power
of
the
government
to
compel
documents
from
anybody
except
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
that’s
an
example
of
the
regulation
both
of
the
seller
and
of
the
buyer.
my
interpretation
of
what
mr.
anders
--
the
categories
in
which
mr.
anderson
put
these
previously
existing
laws
were
--
is
a
little
bit
different,
i
would
say
that
all
this
preexisting
laws
regulate
other
than
the
record
keeper,
the
record
keeper’s
costumer
or
the
record
keeper’s
costumer’s
tax
liability
for
example
in
his
relationship
to
the
record
keeper.
the
donaldson
case
is
a
good
example
where
they
subpoenaed
the
records
of
the
employees,
former
employer
and
the
former
employer’s
account
in
order
to
check
on
the
tax
liability
of
the
employee.
that
was
a
record
kept
by
the
record
keeper
which
was
relevant
to
tax
liability
of
the
subject
to
the
records,
but
only
out
of
the
relationship
between
the
two
whereas
the
record
kept
a
--
mr.
justice
brennan’s
hypothetical
$15,000.00
check,
is
a
record
directed
to
the
relationship
between
him
and
some
fourth
party
of
whom
criminality
may
be
suspected.
i
think
i
should
back
up
a
little
bit
and
identify
the
somewhat
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
if
i
tend
to
do
that,
any
record
keeping
requirement
might
tend
in
some
cases
to
evidence
criminality,
but
one
which
is
for,
“the
purpose,”
and
i
am
quoting
the
government’s
brief
of
enforcing
the
criminal
law
is
a
wholly
different
animal
than
one
which
is
for
the
primary
purpose
of
enforcing
the
civil
law
and
has
tangential
criminal
consequences.
the
government
doesn’t
disagree
that
compelling
a
report
as
opposed
to
the
keeping
of
the
record,
is
a
search
and
seizure
governed
by
the
fourth
amendment.
it
doesn’t
disagree
that
it
is
the
criminal
law
for
which
these
are
largely
compelled,
but
it
does
not
explain
why
the
warrant
requirement
has
no
application
here
while
there
is
no
judicial
supervision
whatsoever
over
these
reports.
it
doesn’t
explain
why
it
is
abolished,
not
only
the
requirement
of
probable
cause,
but
even
the
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
to
which?
i’m
afraid
i
don’t
understand
your
question.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
now,
i
rep
--
i
think
i
should
inform
the
court
as
to
who
it
is
that
i
represent
here.
i
represent
congressman
stark,
a
bank
costumer,
other
foreign
and
domestic
bank
costumers,
the
security
national
bank
and
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
yes,
i
also
represent
one
foreign
or
four
foreign
investors
who
must
affirmatively
report
their
holdings
and
their
transactions
across
the
border
and
analytically
we
feel
the
foreign
and
domestic
reporting
requirements
are
constitutionally
the
same
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
we
are
arguing
them
both.
frankly
from
a
constitutional
point
of
view,
we
think
the
record
keeping
requirements
are
a
little
more
frightful
even
than
the
reporting
requirements.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
well,
the
fourth
amendment
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
i
as
a
lawyer
representing
clients
who
must
report
--
object
to
the
reports.
i,
representing
bank
costumers
whose
records
are
kept
under
the
coercion
of
the
act
object
to
the
keeping
of
the
records.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
because
they
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendments
combined
and
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
certainly
it
does
and
it
already
does
then
its
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
it
does.
and
we
have
no
complaint
directed
to
any
record
which
the
bank
keeps
in
its
own
business
judgment
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
we
do
when
it
is
coerced
by
the
government
and
not
relevant
to
the
business
purposes
of
the
bank,
then
and
only
then
do
we
object.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
if,
but
for
the
act,
the
record
would
not
be
made
or
kept,
then
we
object
to
it.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
because
the
bank
acts
as
agent
of
the
government
in
doing
that
because
its
irrelevant
to
the
regulatory
purpose
and
because
it
constitutes
a
search.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
the
bank
as
a
matter
of
practice
is
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
yes,
we
would
because
the
banks
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
no.
because
the
banks
are
not
keeping
as
many
records
as
long
as
the
bank
secrecy
act
coerces
them
to
do.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
we
have
no
objection
to
records
kept
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business,
none
at
all.
these
are
not
kept
in
the
ordinary
course
of
business.
they
are
kept
under
the
coercion
of
the
act.
the
act
was
passed
for
the
purpose
of
coercing
the
keeping
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
no,
it's
one
of
our
points.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
if
we
win,
we’ll
give
up
the
ones
that
we
don’t
need,
yes.[laughter]
we
object
only
to
the
records
that
wouldn’t
be
there,
but
for
the
act
not
for
the
records
that
would
be
there
in
the
exercise
of
the
business
judgment
of
the
bank,
for
example,
to
protect
itself
from
suit,
for
example,
to
verify
a
statement
that
came
back
to
the
costumer.
those,
we
have
no
problem
with.
only
when
we
pass
the
point
of
business
judgment
and
enter
area
of
records
not
made
or
kept
but
for
the
act,
do
we
have
a
constitutional
objection.
we
feel
that
those
--
that
enters
the
area
of
agency
that
once
the
bank
passes
out
of
its
business
and
regulatory
function
and
enters
into
its
unwilling
function
as
keeping
records
as
essentially
a
surveillance
mechanism
for
the
government,
then
they're
acting
in
agency
role.
the
government’s
only
answer
to
that
is
to
quote
mr.
justice
white’s
opinion
in
united
states
versus
white
and
say
it’s
just
like
a
willing
informant
receiving
information
from
a
willing
confidant
and
turning
it
over
to
the
government.
we
think
that
analogy
has
no
merit
at
all.
in
the
first
place,
the
banks
here,
as
their
presence
in
court
testifies
are
not
willing
informants
to
the
government.
they
object
to
the
requirement,
they
go
to
jail
if
they
don’t
fulfill
it.
in
the
second,
it
is
by
no
means
voluntary
for
the
bank
costumer
to
deal
with
the
bank
in
the
sense
it
is
for
mr.
hoff
ought
to
deal
with
the
informant
or
mr.
white
to
deal
with
the
informant
in
those
two
decisions.
the
government
basically
says
that
if
you
know
these
people
are
agencies
of
the
government,
something
not
known,
in
aurthur
and
white,
your
choice
is
to
keep
dealing
with
them
and
will
call
that
voluntary
or
to
give
up
banking
and
for
that
matter
financial
institutions
entirely.
you
may
carry
your
cash
to
everybody
you
owe
money
to
even
if
it’s
the
other
end
of
the
country
or
you
may
deal
voluntarily
with
the
agent
of
the
bank.
we
think
that
that
distorts
the
meaning
of
the
term
voluntary
beyond
all
recognition
and
that
is
the
only
answer
the
government
has
to
our
theory
that
when
a
bank
makes
or
keeps
a
record,
it
would
not
otherwise
make
or
keep
in
its
business
judgment,
it
acts
as
an
agent
of
the
government.
if
it
does
that
then
analytically,
there
is
no
difference
between
the
required
reports
and
the
required
records
because
the
search
of
the
records
has
to
be
measured
as
of
the
time
the
agent
of
the
government,
i.e.
the
bank,
acts
and
copies
the
record.
now,
there
is
solid
precedent
aside
from
this
agency
theory
for
equating
the
constitutional
effect
of
the
recordkeeping
and
the
reporting.
it's
found
in
marchetti
versus
united
states.
there,
the
court
on
rehearing
asked
the
parties
to
brief
the
question
of
the
effect
of
shapiro
versus
united
states
and
the
government
repeatedly
insisted
in
its
brief
that
there
was
no
application
to
marchetti
of
shapiro
because
shapiro
involved
records
and
marchetti
involved
reports.
in
footnote
14
of
mr.
justice
harlan’s
opinion
in
that
case,
he
said,
“the
court
finds
no
meaningful
distinction
between
the
two.”
now
in
shapiro,
a
subpoena
was
issued
for
the
records
that
were
required
to
be
kept,
issued
to
a
party
who
had
adversary
interest
in
contesting
that
subpoena.
here,
the
situation
is
worse
because
the
subpoena
issues
to
a
bank
that
has
no
such
adversary
interest.
the
bank
as
a
matter
of
general
practice
frequently,
especially
in
violation
of
its
higher
level
policy
by
lower
level
employees
gives
law
enforcement
what
they
ask
for
without
a
summons.
even
if
they
get
a
summons,
they
put
it
in
the
file
and
turn
the
material
over.
the
government
does
not
deny
this
--
these
facts,
the
legislative
history
makes
them
perfectly
plain.
people
simply
do
not
get
a
chance
to
contest
subpoenas
directed
to
their
bank
account
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events.
even
if
they
do,
the
government’s
reading
of
couch
and
donaldson
would
give
no
standing
to
the
parties
to
assert
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
rights
should
that
subpoena
ever
be
discovered
by
them
in
time
to
litigate
it.
under
our
reading
of
course,
the
costumer
does
have
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
interest
in
records
not
otherwise
made
or
kept
in
the
business
judgment
of
the
bank
and
would
under
couch
and
donaldson
have
standing
to
object.
but
even
that
would
not
avail
the
costumer
a
very
much.
let’s
suppose
that
i
am
prosecuted
on
the
basis
of
a
copy
of
a
check
subpoenaed
from
my
bank.
the
government
says,
“well,
it
will
be
time
enough
for
you
to
raise
your
fourth
and
fifth
amendment
objections
when
you
are
prosecuted
on
the
basis
of
the
check.”
what
would
i
have
to
prove?
i
would
have
to
prove
that
in
the
ordinary
business
practice
of
my
bank,
the
check
would
not
have
been
copied
and
it
was,
but
for
the
act
that
the
check
was
copied.
now,
since
ordinary
business
practice
stopped
--
practice
stopped
in
july
1,
1972
when
this
regulations
went
into
effect
and
since
they
went
into
effect
because
of
rapid
technological
change
as
the
years
go
by,
that
burden
of
proof
changes
from
very
difficult
which
it
is
now
to
impossible
which
it
will
be
in
a
few
years.
next,
the
government
says,
“well,
you
have
time
enough
to
raise
these
objections
when
you're
prosecuted
or
otherwise
proceeded
against
without
paying
any
attention
to
the
relief
we
ask
here.
if
i
successfully
suppress
that
check,
all
i
get
is
the
suppression
of
one
check.
we
ask
here
for
the
invalidation
of
the
act.
but
finally
and
most
important
when
the
government
says
that
it
is
time
--
time
enough
when
the
subpoena
is
served
in
your
bank,
should
you
luck
--
be
lucky
enough
to
find
out
about
it
and
litigate
it.
to
litigate
these
questions,
it
ignores
the
difference
between
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
exclusionary
rule.
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
quite
correctly
in
this
opinion
for
the
court
in
u.s.
v.
robinson
only
last
month,
virtually
all
of
this
court’s
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence
has
arisen
since
weeks
versus
united
states
and
in
the
context
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
this
is
one
of
the
rare
and
happy
cases
in
which
you
have
innocent
parties
before
you
asking
for
the
protection
of
privacy
afforded
by
the
fourth
amendment.
the
government
saying
that
we’re
premature
in
this
case
because
we
haven’t
been
preceded
against
ignores
the
fact
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
the
innocent
as
well
as
the
guilty
to
invert
an
old
phrase,
and
ignores
the
fact
that
the
fourth
amendment
protects
privacy,
not
guilty
secrets.
and
so
we
are
not
prematurely
here
even
assuming
that
we
get
notice
of
a
subpoena
of
our
bank
account,
even
assuming
we
could
litigate
all
this
questions
under
couch
and
donaldson,
now
is
the
time,
perhaps
the
only
time
in
which
these
issues
can
be
decided.
finally,
there
is
a
connection
between
the
fourth
amendment
and
fifth
amendment
which
makes
the
separation
of
them
by
the
government,
we
think
indefensible
in
the
case.
this
court
has
not
had
a
majority
for
what
boyd
versus
united
states
means
with
respect
to
the
intimate
connection
between
the
two
amendments.
since
boyd
was
decided
in
1886,
mr.
justice
marshall’s
exploration
of
the
several
different
interpretations
of
that
intimate
relationship
in
his
dissent
in
the
couch
case
throws
some
light
on
the
issues
here.
but
i
think
to
quote
mr.
justice
frankfurter
when
he
was
writing
for
the
court
in
frank
versus
maryland
later
overruled,
in
some
excellent
dictum,
he
said,
“it
is
not
necessary
to
accept
any
particular
theory
of
the
interrelationship
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment.
to
understand
what
lies,
not
at
its
periphery
but
at
its
core,
self-protection,
self-protection
of
a
party
from
being
compelled
to
create
and
produce
evidence
against
himself.
the
central
purpose,
the
purpose
as
the
government
calls
it,
of
the
bank
secrecy
act,
is
to
force
private
citizens
to
create
and
deliver
to
the
government
or
hold
for
its
later
obtaining
by
means
of
judicial
process
or
otherwise,
evidence
of
crime,
their
own
or
someone
else’s.
now,
if
the
government
told
everybody,
told
private
citizens
to
keep
watch
on
their
neighbor,
record
their
comings
and
goings,
report
anything
unusual
that
would
be
different
from
this
case
only
in
the
fact
that
they
were
speaking
to
private
citizens
not
regulated
industries.
the
government
here
argues
that
the
difference
is
constitutionally
critical
because
it
has
plenary
regulatory
power
over
banks,
it
can
order
banks
for
purposes
foreign
to
that
power
to
keep
watch
over
its
costumers
and
their
relation
with
still
other
fourth
parties
in
order
to
enforce
the
criminal
law.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
yes,
in
our
view
they're
constitutional
and
distinguishable.
the
reporting
requirements
are
easier
because
they're
an
outright
seizure.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
they
alleged
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
the
complaint
which
was
a
few
weeks
before
the
effective
date
of
the
act
that
they
had
done
so
in
the
recent
past
and
would
do
so
in
the
immediate
future,
and
therefore,
we’re
under
the
effect
of
the
regulation.
i
have
four
clients,
lieberman,
harwood,
bruer,
and
durell,
all
of
whom
are
required
to
report
their
folder
--
their
foreign
holdings.
lieberman
sends
monetary
instruments
in
excess
of
$5,000.00
across
the
border.
lieberman
and
the
three
others
all
have
financial
interest
in
or
signature
authority
over
foreign
bank
accounts.
as
such,
they
are
required
affirmatively
to
report
those
of
the
government
and
have
been
doing
so
because
the
district
court
declined
to
enjoin
that
portion
of
the
act.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
yes,
i
am.
it
was
easier
to
verify
the
complaint.
and
finally,
i
might
mention
a
word
before
my
first
section
of
time
runs
out
about
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
the
government
is
willing
to
agree
that
we
have
a
right
to
protect
our
membership
list.
it
is
willing
to
agree
that
this
case
creates
a
membership
list.
it
is
willing
to
agree
that
a
frequently
for
law
enforcement
purposes
has
access
to
bank
records
without
any
process
at
all.
it
is
willing
to
agree
that
even
if
it
serves
the
process,
that
process,
usually
it
is
not
learned
about
by
the
costumer
and
still
it
says
that
we
are
prematurely
here
that
we
must
again
wait
for
some
summons
or
subpoena
to
be
served
upon
us.
we
submit
that
a
nationwide
known
scheme
of
the
collection
of
membership
lists
in
the
hands
of
a
third
party
with
no
instinct
or
interest
in
litigating
is
too
much
of
an
exposure
of
that
membership
list
to
be
tolerated
under
the
first
amendment.
the
d.c.
circuit’s
decision
in
united
states
servicemen’s
fund
turns
on
exactly
that
point.
it
was
the
lack
of
a
litigative
in
a
third
party
who
is
holding
the
records
that
gave
the
united
states
serving
--
servicemen’s
funds
standing
to
intervene
to
seek
the
sort
of
equitable
relief
that
we
seek
here.
if
it
please
the
court,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i’ll
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
the
organization
would
have
to
be
of
the
type
that
was
controversial
and
whose
members
could
reasonably
plead
that
they
could
expect
retaliation
or
exposure.
it
would
have
to
come
under
the
rules
set
forth
in
for
example,
naacp
versus
alabama.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
any
group
who
had
a
reasonable
interest
in
the
privacy
of
its
membership
list
would.
any
group
who
didn’t
care
about
the
maintenance
of
that
privacy
and
didn’t
care
because
it
wouldn’t
affect
first
amendment
rights
but
not
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
because
the
check
goes
through
our
account
and
the
bank
makes
pictures
of
our
account
mr.
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
oh!
well,
if
his
own
bank
takes
a
picture
of
his
check
and
its
written
up
to
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
because
he
knows
that
his
bank
is
going
to
keep
a
record
of
the
fact
that
he
paid
money
to
the
american
civil
liberties
union.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
no.
only
checks
that
illustrate
on
their
face
that
they
are
payable
to
us.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
choice
of
adjectives
such
as
restrained
is
of
course
largely
up
to
the
user.
we
do
not
think
that
the
surveillance
of
two
hundred
million
bank
accounts
which
is
how
many
there
are
in
this
country
is
restrained.
we
do
not
think
that
the
copies
--
copying
of
in
excess
of
20
billion
checks
a
year
which
is
how
many
clear
their
makers
banks
in
this
country
every
year
is
restrained.
even
if
we
assume
that
every
bank
in
the
country
pays
the
extra
money
to
sort
out
the
checks
that
are
under
a
hundred
dollars
and
not
copy
them.
by
the
government’s
own
statistic,
that
reduces
the
number
by
90%
down
to
2
billion
checks
every
year.
we
do
not
think
that
is
restrained
either,
but
we
do
not
think
that
if
the
constitution
permits
the
copying
of
checks
over
a
hundred
dollars
simply
because
they're
over
a
hundred
dollars
then
that
makes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
they
do
but
not
in
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law.
and
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
often
used,
yes.
and
this
court
has
had
an
occasion
to
deal
with
the
difficult
problem
where
the
tax
law
and
the
criminal
law
meet
in
a
grey
area
and
it
becomes
a
bleeder's
option
in
the
hands
of
the
irs.
this
is
not
such
a
case.
the
government
began
this
case.
it's
opening
brief
crossed
with
ours
in
the
mail.
both
briefs
claimed
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law.
apparently
when
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
yes
we
do.
we
think
that
the
analogy
to
our
customs
declaration
is
slightly
ridiculous.
the
form
on
which
these
transactions
have
to
be
reported
requires
such
things
as
agency
if
a
--
if
an
instrument
is
transported
not
physically
across
the
border,
but
through
the
first
class
mails,
it
still
has
to
be
reported
and
if
you
do
it
for
someone
else,
you
have
to
name
him,
give
this
address
and
give
his
business
or
occupation.
that’s
not
like
a
customs
declaration.
i
can
bring
a
bottle
of
scotch
from
heathrow
airport
and
i
may
have
to
declare
it
but
i
don’t
have
to
say,
who
i’m
giving
it
to.
there's
a
great
deal
more
information
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
that
i
do
it
for
the
purpose
of
giving
it
to
someone
else?
mr.
charles
c.
marson
i
was
unaware
of
that
your
honor.
do
i
have
to
list
the
other
persons
profession
and
business,
i
doubt
that.
the
government
says
in
its
own
brief
that
the
purpose
of
these
reports
is
to
supply
leads
to
see
which
record
should
be
subpoenaed
or
summoned
which
i
think
has
a
slightly
different
cast
on
it.
the
government
and
we
all
claim
that
criminal
law
enforcement
was
the
central
purpose
of
this
legislation
in
our
opening
briefs.
then
in
its
appellee’s
brief
the
government
as
it
does
here
takes
a
slightly
different
provision
--
position
that
this
is
being
done
pursuant
to
the
regulatory
power
of
congress
over
banks.
now
everywhere,
the
legislative
history
of
course
does
not
support
that
and
the
government
doesn’t
claim
that
it
does,
everywhere
the
act
exempts
transactions
that
have
to
do
with
banks.
an
intra
bank
transaction
is
nowhere
required
to
be
reported
or
recorded.
transactions
between
two
banks,
unless
there
are
customers
involved
do
not
have
to
be
recorded
or
reported.
a
good
illustration
of
how
little
this
has
to
do
with
the
regulation
of
banks
is
this.
my
client,
security
national
bank
could
tomorrow
give
mr.
anderson’s
client
the
bank
of
america
$15
billion
dollars
in
used
hundred
dollar
bills
and
as
far
the
bank
secrecy
act
is
concerned
they
wouldn’t
even
have
to
write
it
down
let
alone
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
well,
their
own
ledger
sheets
has
between
them
would
disclose
the
transaction,
but
they
would
not
have
to
report
that
under
the
bank
secrecy
act
and
i
don’t
know
that
they
would
have
to
report
it
under
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
(voice
overlap)
mr.
charles
c.
marson
no,
not
under
this
act.
my
point
is
the
bank
secrecy
act
as
opposed
to
some
other
act
of
congress
has
nothing
to
do
with
those
kinds
of
transactions.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
regulation
of
banks.
so
to
support
the
bank
secrecy
act
as
opposed
to
the
federal
reserve
act
on
the
theory
that
is
a
regulation
of
commerce
is
wholly
unjustifiable
in
this
case.
of
course,
the
federal
reserve
act
is
a
legitimate
regulation
of
commerce
and
that
is
not
challenged
here.
the
bank
secrecy
act
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
regulation
of
banking.
the
analogy
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
that’s
correct.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
actually
it
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
in
terms
of
its
purpose
it
ought
to
be
comprehended
as
an
exercise
as
a
police
power.
it
happens
to
be
used
as
a
means
its
plenary
regulatory
power
over
the
banks.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
let
me
offer
this
analogy
of
the
interplay
of
these
powers
to
the
fourth
amendment.
the
congress
has
every
bit
of
the
plenary
power
over
the
telephone
company
as
it
does
over
the
banks.
if
tomorrow
somebody
invented
the
technology
to
record
all
calls
and
if
the
day
after
congress
passed
an
act
called
the
telephone
secrecy
act
which
required
them
to
do
so
and
then
the
solicitor
general
defended
the
act
on
the
ground
that
the
government
had
plenary
regulatory
power
over
the
telephone
company
and
that
the
parties
who
were
engaged
in
those
calls
had
no
interest
in
those
calls
that
they
were
third
party
business
records,
that
they
were
not
reached
under
couch
and
donaldson,
then
that
theory
which
is
identical
to
this
theory
except
the
technology
isn’t
here
yet,
then
that
theory
would
wipe
out
katz
and
burger
and
u.s.
v.
u.s.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
i
agree
with
that,
yes
sir.
mr.
charles
c.
marson
for
the
purpose
that
you’ve
stated,
it
would
not
but
nobody
claims
here
except
--
mr.
charles
c.
marson
well,
certainly
the
fourth
amendment
does
as
this
court
has
frequently
decided.
it
is
the
suggestion
of
the
government
that
--
because
they
serve
multiple
purposes
here
that
the
criminal
law
aspect
of
this
legislation
can
be
ignored
notwithstanding
its
primacy
in
the
legislative
history,
in
the
act
and
then
government’s
opening
brief.
the
suggestion
is
that
because
this
act
serves
all
legal
purposes
at
once,
it
therefore
can
be
justified
by
reference
to
all
regulatory
purposes
at
once.
it
seems
to
us
that
that
constitutes
an
abandonment
of
judicial
supervision
over
the
scope
of
the
government’s
power
to
require
records.
take
for
example,
section
6001
of
the
tax
code.
that’s
the
section
under
which
the
tax
authorities
already
have
plenary
power
to
require
such
records
and
to
require
such
statements
which
is
the
equivalent
of
reports
as
are
necessary
to
assess
the
tax
liability
of
any
person.
that
was
not
enough
to
support
what
has
been
enacted
here.
this
court
in
measuring
a
subpoena
under
7602
of
the
tax
code
could
measure
the
purpose
of
the
subpoena,
i.e.
the
enforcement
of
tax
liability
in
the
specific
context
of
the
purpose
of
taxation
against
the
scope
and
necessity
in
showing
made
for
the
subpoena
because
there
is
a
referent,
there
is
a
specific
purpose
to
be
fulfilled.
when
specific
purposes
are
abandoned
and
the
whole
of
enforceable
law
becomes
the
end-product,
a
piece
of
legislation,
then
that
means
that
the
referent,
the
measuring
stick
for
the
reasonableness
of
a
search
for
an
order
to
produce
documents
is
gone.
if
congress
can
enforce
all
purposes
at
once,
it
is
implicit
in
the
solicitor
general’s
argument
that
the
enforcement
of
those
purposes
knows
no
limit
because
they
are
of
purpose.
that
we
think
is
an
essentially
dangerous
notion
to
the
fourth
amendment.
