ask

in
any
banks
any
checks
they
get
in,
drawn
on
some
other
bank,
they
said
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
do
keep
microfilm
of

for
a
short
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
question
is
whether
it’s

long,
this

justice

white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
if
that
is

even
more
justified?

against
somebody
else
and
this
just
runs
around
the

so
you're
a
--
you're
really
objecting
to
thank
keeping
records
of
your

of
your
client's
affair?
justice
byron

white
you
are
arguing
reporting
requirements
more
than
record
keeping?
justice
byron

white
well,
maybe
its
frightful
but
i
don’t
know
about
