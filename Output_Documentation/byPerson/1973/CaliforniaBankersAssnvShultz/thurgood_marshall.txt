justice
thurgood
marshall
why?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
don’t
you
think
a
bank
has
the
right
to
keep
a
record
that
will
protect
itself
in
case
of
a
suit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
(voice
overlap)
--
well,
why
can’t
it
keep
those
reports?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
don’t
--
you
said
you
objected
to
the
keeping
of
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
have
to
have
both
coercion
and
relevancy
because
i
can
find
relevancy
without
any
problem.
justice
thurgood
marshall
on
what
ground?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
the
keeper
--
report,
the
bank
might
not
turn
the
reports
over.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
the
bank
is
keeping
--
if
the
bank
has
been
keeping
reports
for
the
last
35
years,
would
you
still
have
a
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
you
just
found
out?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
they
had
been?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
object
to
the
keeping
of
the
reports
because
they
are
given
over
to
the
government,
that’s
your
point
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
you
win
on
that,
would
you
give
up
the
other
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
any
other
organization
in
the
country
that
couldn’t
also
be
a
party?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
any
of
them,
any
group
with
would
be
able
to
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
any
(voice

american
union
member
joe
doe
goes
in
and
cashes
his
bonds
and
gets
a
check
for
$15,000.00,
how
does
he
become
--
get
on
the
list
as
a
member
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
by
cashing
a
check?
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no,
no,
no.
this
is
his
own
check.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
can
the
american
liberties
union
have
anything
to
do
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
the
man
cashed
a
check
for
$15,000.00
from
babies
united
payable
to
him
and
he’s
member
of
the
american
civil
liberties
union,
does
the
american
civil
liberties
union
have
a
right
to
bring
an
action
to
stop
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
maybe
because
the
(voice

--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
of
course
the
(voice
overlap)the
way
it
is
today
show
--
shouldn’t
have
many
hundred
dollar
checks?[laughter]
i
mean,
unless
you're
going
to
buy
a
pack
of
cigarettes
or
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
three
year
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
we
go
to
the
next
point?
if
the
banks
get
nothing
for
this,
what's
your
penalty
if
they
don’t
comply?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
criminal
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
i
guess
the
answer
is
they
don’t
want
--
they're
ignoring
business.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
congress
could
put
that
on
any
other
business?
as
well
in
the
banking
business?
justice
thurgood
marshall
internal
revenues
--
internal
revenue
for
example?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
talking
about
these
provisions
on
the
basis
of
what
you
say
here
which
is
that
you
might
want
to
prosecute.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
what
the
petition
said,
it’s
your
whole
thrust
in
your
brief
and
i
think
they’ve
got
so
many,
you
keep
talking
about
criminal.
justice
thurgood
marshall
secret
accounts
in
domestic
banks?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
immediately
you
say
criminal
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
must
--
won’t
you
agree
with
me,
what
lies
in
it?
the
way
you
say
your
thrust
is
criminal,
you
waived
the
fifth
amendment
flag,
don’t
you
automatically?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
only
pleading
--
the
only
pleading
i
can
do
to
that
stage
would
be
to
cash
in
a
check.
justice
thurgood
marshall
we’re
not
talking
about
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
talking
about
40
--
$100.00
man
has
got
a
check
for
a
$101.00.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
gives
up
all
his
right
--
he
gives
up
all
his
right
when
he
puts
that
bank
--
that
check
in
the
bank.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that’s
all
he
meant
to
commute
--
that’s
only
person
he
meant
to
communicate
to,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
i
don’t
think
that
the
couch
case
said
that
the
--
accountant
that
was
given
these
internal
revenue
materials
was
obliged
to
turn
that
over
to
the
government,
i
don’t
think
that’s
(voice

--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
if
you
don’t
(voice

--
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
reporting
provision?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
whatever,
in
fact
everybody
in
the
united
states
is
under
that
and
yet
in
this
a
lot
of
percentage
of
people
are
never
going
to
get
involved
in
any
criminal
offense,
but
they
still
get
their
name
put
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
not
talking
about
overseas
banks.
i
am
talking
about
the
the
local
ones,
with
the
local
ones,
a
guy
who
doesn’t
know
where
switzerland
is?
justice
thurgood

and
he’s
made
a
cash
transaction
of
$230.00
to
buy
a
washing
machine
and
he
get

he
goes
to

justice
thurgood

you
raise
$10,000.00
to
buy
a
house.
justice
thurgood
marshall
his
own
grandfather
left
the
10,000.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
he
wouldn’t
know
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
don’t
pay
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
don’t
pay
the
bank
notifying
date.
and
i
assume
that
the
bank
wouldn’t
notify
him
and
pay
the
bill
themselves,
could
i
assume
that,
from
my
experience
with
banks?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
have
to
report
somebody
in
the
government.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
would
not
report
it
under
any
act?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
better
look
up
some
more.
bank
transfers
are
reported
to
the
government,
i
am
sure
as
i’m
sitting
here.
justice
thurgood

not
under
the

act,
of
course
not?
justice
thurgood

why?
justice
thurgood

well,
don’t
you
think
a
bank
has
the
right
to
keep
a

that
will
protect

in

of
a

justice
thurgood

i
(voice

well,
why
can’t
it
keep

justice
thurgood

don’t

you
have

because
i

justice
thurgood

because
the

if

would
you
