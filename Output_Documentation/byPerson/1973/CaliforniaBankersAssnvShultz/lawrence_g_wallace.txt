mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
so-called
bank
secrecy
act,
oh!
i
should
say
before
i
begin
that
i
asked
the
clerk
to
distribute
a
little
xerox
copy
because
the
regulations
as
they’re
reproduced
in
the
appendix
to
our
jurisdictional
statement
and
in
the
appendices
to
the
california
bankers
association
briefs
omitted
some
intervening
changes
which
made
them
inaccurate
in
minor
respects
that
don’t
affect
the
argument
in
this
case.
principally
103.35
is
the
one
that
can’t
really
be
reconstructed
without
the
aid
of
this,
but
with
these
in
your
hands
along
with
the
others,
it
will
be
possible
to
see
what
all
of
the
regulations
currently
are.
they
were
amended
in
both
december
of
1972
and
january
of
1973
and
the
current
regulations
are
reprinted
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations.
the
act
was
enacted
by
congress
in
1970,
following
extensive
and
detailed
hearings
concerning
the
wide
spread
use
made
by
persons
in
the
united
states
of
foreign
bank
accounts
in
bank
secrecy
jurisdictions
for
the
purpose
of
concealing
violations
of
the
united
states
tax
regulatory
and
criminal
laws
or
concealing
the
fruits
of
such
violations
and
concerning
the
difficulties
in
enforcing
federal
tax,
regulatory
and
criminal
laws
that
had
been
caused
by
the
failure
of
some
domestic
banks
and
other
financial
institutions
to
keep
adequate
records
of
checking
account
transactions
and
of
the
identity
of
their
costumers.
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
make
available
greater
evidence
of
financial
transactions
in
order
to
deter
the
use
of
the
channels
of
commerce
for
illicit
purposes.
or
in
the
words
of
the
senate
report,
“in
order
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
white
collar
crime.”
titles
i
and
ii
of
the
of
the
act
and
their
implementing
regulations
were
challenged
in
this
case.
title
i
is
the
recordkeeping
provisions
and
title
ii
are
the
reporting
provisions
which
basically
are
in
two
parts
for
purposes
of
our
concerns
here;
the
reports
of
domestic
currency
transactions
and
reports
of
foreign
financial
transactions.
the
act’s
provisions
are
not
self-executing,
but
are
designed
to
be
implemented
by
treasury
regulations.
congress
made
clear
its
intention
that
those
regulations
were
to
focus
both
the
recordkeeping
and
the
reporting
requirements
on
financial
information
having
a
--
in
the
phrase
of
both
the
house
committee
report
and
in
the
act
itself,
a
high
degree
of
usefulness
in
criminal
tax
or
regulatory
investigations
or
proceedings
and
by
self
focusing
the
requirements
to
avoid
undue
burdens
on
the
free
flow
of
domestic
and
international
commerce
and
finance.
after
the
act's
purpose
or
passage,
after
the
act’s
passage
in
keeping
with
this
congressional
purpose,
a
treasury
department
taskforce
undertook
a
detailed
study
in
consultation
with
representatives
of
financial
institutions,
of
trade
associations
and
of
government
agencies
to
determine
the
specific
categories
of
records
and
reports
which
should
be
required
to
implement
the
act
and
the
regulations
emanated
from
rulemaking
proceedings
involving
this
taskforce
studies.
they
were
first
adopted
in
april
of
1972
and
then
were
amended
in
december
of
that
year
and
in
january
of
1973,
after
further
comment
in
rulemaking
proceedings
and
also
in
light
of
further
senate
hearings
on
proposed
amendments
to
the
act
that
were
conducted
in
august
of
1972.
and
that
is
why
there
are
sometimes
citations
to
senate
hearings
which
discussed
the
regulations
that
have
already
been
developed
under
act.
those
proposed
amendments
had
to
do
with
proposals
to
restrict
access
to
the
records
which
congress
has
not
enacted,
but
the
amendments
to
the
regulations
do
specify
restrictions
on
access
by
others
in
the
government.
the
--
and
original
legislative
history
made
it
clear
that
the
recordkeeping
provisions
did
not
expand
access
from
it
was
under
established
legal
process.
now,
turning
first
to
the
recordkeeping
provisions
of
title
i
as
implemented
by
the
regulations
and
these
provisions
were
upheld
by
the
district
court,
these
require
financial
institutions
in
the
united
states
to
record
the
identities
of
their
account
holders
and
require
banks
to
make
--
to
maintain
microfilm
or
other
records
of
checks
drawn
on
them.
these
are
requirements
with
respect
to
“on
us
checks”
only
for
sums
in
excess
of
$100.00
dollars.
and
then,
there
are
--
in
addition
to
checks
for
$100.00
or
less,
there
are
other
exceptions
developed
and
these
are
in
the
amended
regulations
that
are
listed
on
page
22
of
the
brief,
this
is
our
brief
for
the
appellees.
there
are
a
number
of
briefs
in
the
case
as
you
know,
and
the
government
brief,
is
appellee
on
page
22,
we
summarize
the
other
exceptions,
dividend
checks
and
payroll
checks
and
others
so
long
as
they
are
drawn
on
an
account,
expected
to
average
at
least
$100.00
checks
per
month.
all
together
then,
that
was
exceptions
coupled
with
the
exception
for
all
checks
of
one
hundred
dollars
or
lees
add
up
to
a
very
substantial
exception
to
the
microfilming
requirements
which
have
been
the
main
focus
of
the
complainant’s
contentions
in
the
case.
the
additional
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
relativity
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there's
relatively
little
in
the
record
that
bears
on
this.
these
amendments
were
made
to
the
regulations
after
the
district
court
decision
in
this
case.
there
is
some
testimony
in
the
hearings
that
we
refer
to,
the
congressional
hearings
that
we
referred
to
in
our
brief
in
which
some
representatives
of
banking
institutions
made
suggestions
that
indicated
that
it
would
be
possible
and
in
one
instance
that
it
would
be
possible
by
machine
to
make
such
separations
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
at
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
fraudulent
practice
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
problem
in
practice
has
been
for
banks
to
microfilm
all
of
their
checks
and
of
course
for
banks
that
have
been
doing
that
even
though
they
have
not
been
retaining
those
microfilms
as
long
as
it
is
required
under
the
regulation
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
five
years
for
this
particular
aspect
of
it.
it's
two
years
in
which
to
reconstruct
entries
into
demand
accounts
in
the
bank,
but
for
the
microfilming
“on
us
checks,”
it's
five
years.
the
hearings
did
bring
out
that
most
of
the
banks
had
been
microfilming
their
checks
although
the
period
for
which
they
retained
them
has
varied
a
great
deal.
and
certainly
banks
that
have
been
microfilming
all
of
their
checks
would
be
likely
to
retain
all
of
their
checks
for
the
five-year
period
rather
than
have
to
sort
out
the
microfilms
afterwards.
the
regulations
developing
the
exceptions
were
developed
in
consultation
and
in
light
of
comments
by
members
of
the
industry.
and
while
there
is
nothing
in
public
record,
the
treasury
department
did
include
the
exception
in
response
to
industry
suggestion
that
this
would
be
a
useful
and
in
keeping
with
the
congressional
purpose,
not
to
cause
any
unnecessary
burdens
on
the
flow
of
commerce
that
substantially
contribute
to
the
purposes
of
the
act.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
what
banks
are
doing
since
the
adoption
of
the
regulations.
the
treasury
department
has
some
information,
however,
that
would
give
us
a
basis
for
introducing
evidence
in
a
proper
proceeding
that
this
is
a
useful
exception
from
some
institutions
and
that
it's
an
exception
that
they're
able
to
take
advantage
of.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
does
not
with
respect
to
any
of
this
requirements.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
neither
do
the
regulations.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
of
course,
it
doesn’t
specify
that
microfilm
has
to
be
the
process
by
which
a
copy
of
the
check
is
retained.
the
hearings
indicated
that
it
was
only
the
largest
institutions
that
were
getting
away
from
microfilming,
not
the
smaller
ones,
that
they
were
using
the
microfilming
process.
that
was
what
the
evidence
before
congress
appeared
to
indicate.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
it
chose
to,
it
could
under
the
regulations.
the
regulations
don’t
specify
the
form
in
which
copies
are
to
be
maintained
but
the
practice
of
small
banks
is
to
use
microfilm
and
the
main
reason
for
the
need
for
the
recordkeeping
requirements
brought
out
in
the
hearing
was
that
in
view
of
the
largest
banks
in
the
country
had
decided
not
to
engage
in
the
pervasive
photocopying
that
was
common
practice
in
the
industry
and
they
were
problems
about
periods
of
retention.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
a
testimony
about
the
need
and
the
usefulness
of
bank
records
in
aiding
investigations
both
to
determine
tax
liability.
there
was
a
testimony
by
the
internal
revenue
agents.
there
was
a
testimony
by
united
states
attorneys
indicating
in
detail
various
--
sometimes
quite
intricate
criminal
schemes
that
had
been
investigated
through
the
use
of
bank
records
and
problems
that
they
run
into
when
the
bank
records
were
not
available
and
there
was
testimony
by
the
assistant
attorney
general
in
charge
of
the
criminal
division
indicating
the
importance
of
having
such
records
available
for
use
in
evidence
in
trials,
rather
than
relying
on
oral
testimony.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
no
compensation
provided
in
the
act
or
the
regulations
your
honor.
the
findings
made
by
the
congressional
committees
were
that
these
requirements
would
not
impose
an
undue
burden
indeed
that
there
would
not
be
a
very
substantial
burden
imposed
on
most
banks
at
all
because
they
are
already
made
copies
of
these
records
for
their
own
purposes
and
extending
the
period
in
which
they
retain
them
in
considering
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
would
be
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
are
expenses.
there
was
a
testimony
in
the
hearings
about
the
expenses
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
testimony
was
that
the
cost
had
been
estimated
to
range
between
one
half
mill
and
one
and
a
half
mills
for
a
check,
a
mill
being
a
tenth
of
a
cent.
and
the
senate
committee
specifically
said
the
cost
of
microfilming
has
been
estimated
in
the
hearings,
to
range
between
½
of
the
mill
and
½
miles
for
check,
a
cost,
that
does
not
appear
to
be
unduly
onerous
compared
to
the
normal
service
charge
of
ten
cents
per
check.
and
across
which
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
recordkeeping
requirements
don’t
impose
any
additional
requirements
on
the
bank
with
respect
to
access
to
such
records
as
they
have
and
there
wasn’t
a
complete
cross
breakdown,
there
was
testimony
in
the
hearings
that
--
by
representatives
of
the
banking
industry
that
the
costs
would
not
be
unduly
onerous
and
the
costs
are
tax
deductible.
we
have
a
quotation
in
our
brief
on
that
precise
point
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
would
presume
so
although
there's
no
indication
that
anyone
has
raised
the
service
cost
from
ten
cents
to
ten
and
a
half
cents
check.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
are
provisions
for
civil
penalties
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
or
the
possibility
for
criminal
violations,
that
is
correct.
this
is
a
regulation
imposed
by
congress
on
them
as
something
they
have
to
meet
in
order
to
engaged
in
their
enterprise
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that’s
right.
the
congress
concluded
that
in
regulating
this
industry
which
provides
many
opportunities
for
evasion
of
other
legal
requirements
if
adequate
records
are
not
kept
of
the
identities
of
costumers
and
what
has
occurred
in
their
accounts
so
that’ll
be
available
when
legitimate
investigatory
needs
are
shown
that
this
is
part
of
the
burden
to
be
borne
as
a
good
citizen.
as
a
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
congress
has
imposed
a
great
many
recordkeeping
requirements
on
numerous
businesses
in
order
to
implement
various
federal
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that’s
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that’s
the
only
one
basis
that
these
provisions
are
also
needed
to
investigate
whether
internal
revenue
has
been
paid
adequately
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
focus
on
criminal
schemes
and
the
use
of
secret
accounts
to
conceal
the
fruits
of
criminal
schemes
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
secret
accounts
in
foreign
banks
and
getting
it
there
through
secret
transactions
in
united
states
banks
and
transactions
that
couldn’t
adequately
be
traced
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
bank
costumers
who
aren't
accurately
identified
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
are
you
speaking
of
the
privileging
against
self-incrimination?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
someone
is
being
required
to
incriminate
himself
and
pleads
the
privilege,
that
question
is
raised.
i
don’t
think
it's
raised
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
the
banks,
that
corporations
who
don’t
have
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
no
one
else
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
is
being
required
to
keep
a
record
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
he
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
haven’t
said
anything
about
giving
up
all
his
rights.
he
is
--
communicated
to
the
bank
what
that
check
communicates
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
he
has
a
right
to
uphold
the
confidentiality
of
that
communication
from
disclosure
that
would
arise
--
that
question
would
arise
when
an
attempt
was
made
to
get
the
bank
to
disclose
it.
this
court
said
in
the
couch
case
that
there
is
no
such
privilege.
that
maybe
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
all
he
meant
to
communicate
it
to
but
the
bank
can
be
compelled
to
testify
as
to
its
knowledge
of
what
he
communicated
to
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
neither
does
the
act.
the
act
gives
the
government
no
additional
access
to
any
records
required
to
be
kept,
no
access
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
if
they
don’t
have
a
normal
legal
process
of
a
summons
or
a
subpoena.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
reporting
provisions
are
something
else
and
i’ll
turn
to
those
now
with
just
--
if
i
may,
wanted
to
close
in
comments
about
the
recordkeeping
provisions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so
that
we
--
won’t
need
to
return
to
them
unless
there
are
further
questions
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
the
major
thrust
of
it.
and
that
was
the
testimony.
it
was
just
a
very
few
of
the
largest
banks
that
had
decided
that
it
wasn’t
worth
their
while
to
photocopy
everything
and
to
keep
these
records
as
long
as
they
had
in
the
past.
in
fact
the
house
committee
report
said
that
most
banks
would
be
virtually
unaffected
by
this
particular
aspect
of
the
requirements
and
that
it
is
just
a
few
size
of
the
ones,
the
bank
of
america
was
particularly
testified
about
and
that
is
correct
your
honor.
so,
the
principle
as
we
understand
it,
of
the
california
bankers
association
argument
that
this
is
undue
burden
whether
that
stated
as
a
fourth
or
fifth
amendment
objection
and
it’s
hard
for
us
to
see
why
a
recordkeeping
requirement
is
a
search
or
seizure,
but
it
seems
to
us
it
has
to
be
more
a
fifth
amendment
objection.
that
is
answered
by
the
consideration,
it
seems
to
us
that
congress
gave
to
the
needs
that
the
government
had
as
a
necessary
improper
means
of
facilitating
enforcement
of
tax,
regulatory,
and
criminal
laws
that
this
would
not
be
undue
burden
and
i
don’t
think
this
congressional
judgment
as
been
shown
by
anything
presented
in
the
record
here
not
be
an
entirely
constitutional
one.
the
other
objections
that
had
been
raised
to
the
requirements
by
the
individuals,
if
i
can
just
summarize,
our
position
with
respect
to
them
quite
briefly,
we
don’t
see
that
there's
been
any
compulsion
on
the
individual
with
respect
to
the
recordkeeping
requirements
that
would
form
a
predicate
for
a
fifth
amendment
objection
nor
had
any
of
the
individuals
before
the
court
claimed
that
anything
required
would
tend
to
incriminate
them
which
is
a
necessary
predicate
for
a
fifth
amendment
objection.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
legislative
history
or
purpose
or
anything
that
was
developed
in
the
course
of
developing
the
regulations
for
belief
that
the
government
was
going
to
seek
to
get
the
membership
list
of
any
particular
organization
and
therefore
the
first
amendment
claim
seems
to
us
to
be
a
--
too
speculative
for
presentation
to
the
court,
a
fortiori
on
the
basis
of
this
court’s
decision
last
term
in
laird
against
tatum.
since
there
isn’t
even
any
data
gathering
by
the
government
yet
shown
to
be
taking
place
in
the
present
case
and
the
data
gathering
was
in
involved
in
laird
by
the
government
in
laird
against
tatum
although
no
use
of
that
data
printing
in
proper
or
likelihood
of
that
use
had
been
shown
of
the
fourth
amendment
claim
seems
to
me
that
there's
no
search
or
seizure
being
made
of
the
costumer
because
the
bank
with
whom
he’s
dong
with
business
is
required
to
keep
records
of
its
financial
transactions
with
him
and
other
costumers.
into
the
extent
that
--
it
could
be
said
and
we
suggest
some
reasons
why
it
may
not
be
accurate
to
say
so
that
the
bank
is
operating
as
a
government
agent,
it
is
never
been
held
by
any
court
to
my
knowledge
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
violative
when
the
government
keeps
records
of
its
dealings
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
the
same
sense,
that
is
right.
and
they're
required
to
keep
many
records
and
the
thrust
of
the
argument
of
the
individuals
here
is
that
when
they
have
dealings
with
the
government
and
the
government
keeps
records
of
those
transactions
that
the
government
has
engaged
in
assuming
that
the
bank
is
acting
as
an
agent
of
the
government
that
somehow
raises
a
fourth
amendment
violation
to
us.
that
is
merely
the
government’s
keeping
of
records
of
information
voluntarily
disclosed
to
the
government
by
someone
doing
business
with
it.
we
don’t
really
think
that
the
analogy
of
a
government
agent
is
the
accurate
one
here,
but
without
that
analogy
there's
no
search
or
seizure
with
respect
to
the
individual
at
all
here
since
there’
no
access
by
the
government
provided
by
the
act
to
the
records
that
are
required
to
be
kept.
now,
the
domestic
currency
transaction
reporting
provisions
of
title
ii
or
the
part
of
the
act
that
was
struck
down
by
the
district
court,
this
is
actually
the
least
innovative
feature
of
the
act
because
since
1945,
financial
institutions
have
been
providing
reports
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
and
implementing
regulations
and
also
under
section
2
of
51
of
the
revised
statutes
which
was
another
basis
for
those
regulations.
of
essentially
similar
information
and
these
had
been
of
proven
efficacy
in
the
enforcement
of
the
internal
revenue
laws.
treasury
report
indicative
for
example
that
in
1957
and
1958
alone,
129
fraud
cases
have
been
developed
involving
--
which
led
to
the
generation
of
13
and
a
half
million
dollars
in
additional
taxes
in
penalties
based
directly
on
information
derived
from
these
reports.
and
the
congressional
objective
in
providing
for
such
reporting
requirements
in
the
new
act
was
to
make
the
standards
for
such
reports
by
the
institutions
more
definite.
the
hearings
indicated
that
the
criminal
use
of
financial
institutions
had
increased
in
recent
years
and
there
was
much
testimony
and
findings
in
the
committee
reports
indicating
that
large
amounts
of
cash
are
generated
and
have
to
be
concealed
in
illicit
transactions
and
also
have
to
be
converted
to
assure
the
ultimate
success
of
those
transactions
into
usable
forms
of
credit.
and
so
these
provisions
in
their
implementing
regulations
were
included
in
the
act
and
these
regulations
require
reports
only
by
the
financial
institutions
of
these
transactions
not
by
any
individuals
and
only
of
currency
transactions
in
excess
of
$10,000.00
and
not
commensurate
with
the
customary
conduct
of
the
business
of
an
established
costumer
of
the
bank.
the
information
to
reported
is
summarized
in
our
brief,
this
time,
it's
--
our
brief
as
appellant,
on
pages
14
and
15
in
the
text
of
the
brief.
the
information
is
relatively
simple
and
its
to
be
secured
from
the
party
to
the
transaction,
the
other
party,
the
transaction
by
the
bank
as
a
condition
of
the
banks
engaging
in
such
transactions.
and
this
is
again
a
regulation
of
the
activities
of
the
banks
in
commerce.
the
district
court
--
the
rationale
of
the
district
court
in
striking
down
these
provisions
of
the
act
was
as
we
have
contended
in
detail
in
our
brief
entirely
hypothetical.
it
was
based
on
the
speculation
that
it
might
be
possible
to
have
implementing
regulations
which
would
require
the
reporting
of
other
transactions,
other
than
those
specified
in
the
regulations
including
the
reporting
of
all
transactions
by
check
on
--
personal
checking
accounts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
these
are
transactions
--
one
example
was
given
by
mr.
justice
brennan
if
he
should
get
$15,000.00
in
currency
just
by
presenting
a
check
and
asking
for
that
much
currency
although
the
denominations
of
the
smaller
bills
would
not
have
to
be
reported
on
the
reporting
form,
that
was
the
only
exception
i
would
take
to
the
description
that
was
made.
it's
only
bills
of
a
hundred
dollars
and
over
that
must
be
mentioned
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
i
get
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
that’s
the
--
the
form
itself
does
not
require
all
of
that.
it's
in
our
jurisdiction
of
statement
on
page
121
and
the
denomination
there,
we
were
just
summarizing
it
on
pages
14
and
15.
the
amount
has
to
be
given
and
then
the
amount
in
denominations
of
$100.00
or
higher,
the
form
is
relatively
concise,
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
too
would
be
a
currency
transaction
to
be
reported.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
it
would
be
for
currency
or
other
bearer
instrument
transactions
such
as
a
bank
check
made
out
to
cash
or
something
of
the
sort
which
anybody
could
cash,
a
bearer
instrument
that
has
the
same
negotiability
as
currency,
virtually
the
same
that’s
what
these
are
involved
with.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
i
understand
that
that
would
be
adequate.
these
reports
has
been
purposely
kept
relatively
simple
with
the
idea
that
if
an
internal
revenue,
or
if
it
is
called
for,
of
course
they’ll
be
getting
into
more
detail
then
and
if
there
isn’t,
there
is
no
point
in
burgeoning
transactions
with
onerous
requirements.
a
great
deal
of
time
has
been
devoted
to
developing
the
regulations
and
forms.
the
regulations
didn’t
take
effect
until
two
years
after
the
act
was
passed
because
of
the
efforts
that
were
made.
there
was
an
overriding
congressional
purpose
not
to
cause
unnecessary
burdens
on
the
flow
of
these
transactions.
there
is
a
--
one
aspect
of
the
domestic
currency
transaction
reporting
provisions
that
i
should
devote
a
few
minutes
to
because
it’s
a
problem
that
has
been
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
case,
in
the
briefs
for
the
appellees
filed
not
long
ago
in
the
case
and
that
is
a
contention
that
the
regulation,
a
contention
made
in
the
red
covered
brief
by
the
bankers
association
that
the
regulation
is
invalid
implementing
this
provision
because
it
doesn’t
require
a
report
to
be
made
by
the
costumers
as
well
as
the
bank
and
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
did
contemplate
and
indeed
the
act
required
the
report
to
be
made
by
both
parties
in
order
to
assure
that
the
costumer
would
be
notified.
this
contention
it
seems
to
us
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case.
it's
raised
by
the
california
bankers
association,
its
on
pages
37
through
39
of
their
red
covered
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
received
--
and
in
on
january
5th
in
our
office.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
--
there
was
a
white
covered
brief
that
was
identical
to
it
and
then
the
red
covered
briefs
were
substituted
for
it.
it
might
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
brief
for
the
appellee,
california
bankers
association.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it’s
the
same
as
the
white
covered
brief.
its
exactly
the
same
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
its
no
pages
37
through
39.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that’s
the
same
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that’s
the
same
brief.
the
printer
had
been
instructed
to
bind
it
in
red
and
had
it
bound
it
in
white
and
sent
it
to
them,
and
then
he
sent
substitute
copies
but
they're
all
--
there's
no
change
inside
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
37
through
39,
a
contention
is
made
that
the
regulation
is
invalid
because
it
requires
only
the
financial
institution
to
file
the
report
whereas
the
act
contemplated
that
the
regulation
would
require
both
the
institution
and
the
costumer
to
file
the
report.
we
don’t
believe
this
contention
is
properly
before
the
court
because
its
made
here
by
the
bankers
association
who
are
obviously
not
within
the
zone
of
interest
to
be
protected
under
their
own
contention
which
was
assurance
that
the
costumer
would
be
notified
as
the
congressionally
stated
purpose
of
requiring
both
to
file
the
report.
there
is
nothing
to
stop
the
california,
the
members
of
the
california
bankers
association
from
notifying
their
costumers
when
they
file
such
reports
either
in
person
at
the
time
the
information
is
secured
or
by
sending
the
costumer
a
copy
of
the
report
or
indeed
by
having
the
costumer
countersign
the
report
which
is
not
required
by
the
treasury
regulations,
but
the
report
would
still
be
accepted
by
the
treasury
if
it
were
filed
that
way.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
--
when
you
say
the
statute
is
unambiguous
mr.
justice
stewart,
let
me
look
at
the
statute
at
the
bottom
of
page
37.
the
report
of
any
transaction
required
to
be
reported
under
this
chapter
shall
be
signed
or
otherwise
made.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
both.
well,
of
course
the
information
is
secured
by
the
bank
from
the
costumer
and
the
otherwise
made
language
was
believed
by
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
that
there
are
other
--
additional
provisions
of
the
act
that
are
--
have
a
bearing,
namely
section
206
of
the
act
which
gives
the
secretary
broad
authority,
this
is
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
on
page
80
which
gives
the
secretary
broad
authority
to
make
exceptions
to
the
requirements
of
the
act
as
he
sees
fit
in
developing
the
regulations
and
another
answer
is
that
while
the
house
committee
report
interpreted
this
language
as
requiring
the
report
to
be
made
by
both
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
excerpt
from
that
committee
report
set
out
at
page
38
of
the
brief.
the
senate
committee
took
exact
to
the
contrary
view
and
this
is
not
set
out
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
appellees.
we
didn’t
want
to
burden
the
court
with
an
additional
reply
brief
because
we
didn’t
think
the
issue
is
in
the
case
to
begin
with.
since
there
is
no
withstanding
duress
of
the
individuals
in
the
case,
they
don’t
claim
that
they
engage
in
the
transactions
of
this
type
that
that
they
contemplate
engaging
in
such
transactions.
the
senate
committee
report
with
respect
to
exactly
the
same
statutory
language,
i’m
quoting
out
from
page
15
of
the
brief,
took
exactly
the
opposite
view
in
analyzing
the
domestic
currency
reporting
requirements.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
not
a
brief,
sir.
this
is
page
15
of
the
senate
committee
report
which
is
not
before
the
court,
but
is
available
to
the
court
and
i’ll
read
the
entire
paragraph
since
its
quite
short
and
it’s
the
only
part
dealing
with
the
analysis
of
the
domestic
currency
reporting
provisions.
“these
sections
authorize
the
secretary
to
require
reports
on
transactions
in
currency
or
other
monetary
instruments
involving
domestic
financial
institutions
when
the
transactions
are
in
such
amounts
or
under
such
circumstances
as
the
secretary
may
proscribe.
the
reports
can
be
required
of
the
financial
institution
or
the
party
involved
or
both.
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
designate
domestic
financial
institutions
as
agents
of
the
united
states
to
receive
required
reports.”
that
is
section
223
which
is
never
implemented
and
that
is
the
analysis
given
in
the
senate
committee
report.
but
the
question
is
one
that
the
secretary
gave
a
lot
of
attention
to
in
developing
the
regulations.
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
did
based
on
comments
that
were
made
by
the
industry
as
to
the
cumbersomeness
of
the
process
if
they
had
to
get
their
costumers
to
file
reports
of
such
transactions
and
in
light
of
the
overall
congressional
purpose
of
not
imposing
unnecessary
burdens
on
commerce,
the
secretary
concluded
that
--
and
the
exemption
authority
given
him
should
be
utilized
here
and
that
the
purposes
of
the
act
would
adequately
be
served.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
the
house
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
regulation
does
require
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
precisely
what
the
house
report
said.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
precisely
what
the
house
report
said
and
it
was
contradicted
by
the
senate
report
dealing
with
exactly
the
same
language
in
the
act.
the
conference
report
said
nothing
about
it,
it
just
adopted
the
same
language.
both
reports
are
referring
to
the
same
language
and
they're
just
--
i
don’t
think
the
issue
is
before
the
court
in
the
case
and
for
that
reason
we
haven’t
briefed
it.
it
wasn’t
even
introduced
in
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court.
there
wasn’t
an
objection
raised
at
that
time.
the
only
basis
on
which
the
individuals
before
the
court
claimed
that
they
can
race
the
issue,
is
not
that
they
have
engaged
or
contemplate
engaging
in
this
cash
transactions,
but
that
the
act
as
a
whole
is
not
separable
and
that
if
this
invalid,
the
parts
that
concern
them
are
invalid.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
concerns
expressed
by
congress
about
why
they
needed
to
have
the
various
provisions
pretty
well
refute
the
contention
if
the
court
found
one
aspect
of
it
to
be
invalid
that
it
should
strike
down
the
entire
act,
indeed
the
fact
that
a
substantially
similar,
domestic
reporting
provisions
antedated
the
act
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
and
stood
alone
for
many
years
indicates
that
congress
didn’t
think
all
of
these
had
to
be
one
package.
now,
i’d
like
to
say
just
a
few
words
about
the
foreign
transaction
reporting
provisions
of
title
ii
in
their
implementing
regulations
which
were
upheld
by
the
court
below
and
which
require
reports
of
the
transactions
of
the
individuals
here
do
say
they
engage
in
of
transportations
of
monetary
instruments
involving
more
than
$5,000.00
into
or
out
of
the
united
states
and
reports
by
persons
in
the
united
states
of
their
relationships
with
foreign
financial
institutions.
much
of
the
testimony
developed
in
the
hearings
was
concerned
with
the
very
serious
problems
caused
by
the
concealing
or
purifying
of
fruits
of
domestic
criminal
activity
in
the
concealing
of
on
going
violations
of
tax,
regulatory
and
criminal
laws
by
the
use
of
secret
bank
accounts
in
a
bank
secrecy
jurisdictions,
accounts
over
which
congress
does
not
have
direct
regulatory
authority.
the
examples
given
were
detailed
and
varied
of
the
evasions
of
capital
gains
taxes
through
sales
of
security
of
illegal
trading
in
gold,
the
concealing
of
securities
manipulations,
the
concealing
of
insider
trading
in
securities
and
numerous
other
examples,
a
man
making
a
loan
to
himself
from
his
own
secret
bank
account
and
then
deducting
the
interest
payments
that
it
is
one
that
i
recall
from
the
hearings.
it
was
testified
by
robert
morgan
thaw
(ph),
former
united
states
attorney
of
the
southern
district
of
new
york
that
in
his
estimation,
thousands
of
such
accounts
involving
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
were
being
used
for
illicit
purposes
and
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue,
randolph
thrower
testified
that
the
integrity
of
the
self-assessment
system
of
the
taxation
itself
was
being
threatened
by
the
use
of
these
accounts.
the
objections
that
have
been
raised
to
this
are
first
of
all
a
claim
that
there
might
be
a
problem
under
the
self-incrimination
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment.
we
don’t
believe
that
claim
is
before
the
court
because
no
one
in
court
has
said
that
filing
such
a
report
would
tend
to
incriminate
him
which
is
the
prerequisite
for
raising
any
claim
of
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment.
and
in
any
event
the
claim
would
be
premature.
these
are
reports
to
be
filed
with
the
internal
revenue
return
itself
and
under
the
sullivan
case,
the
claim
should
be
made
--
it's
going
to
be
made
on
the
return
and
under
marchetti
and
grosso,
even
if
there
was
something
so
inherently
incriminating
here
that
the
individual
would
be
justified
in
not
filing
any
report
at
all.
that
would
not
mean
that
they’re
entitled
to
the
kind
of
relief
they
have
sought
in
this
case
which
is
invalidating
the
entire
act
because
others
might
well
be
able
to
comply
without
incriminating
themselves
and
indeed
it's
very
likely
that
couriers
and
others
would
comply.
the
marchetti
and
grosso
cases
both
specifically
said
the
tax
there
was
not
being
struck
down.
they
were
merely
upholding
a
valid
claim
of
privilege
made
by
someone
who
showed
that
he
couldn’t
file
the
report
required
without
incriminating
himself.
and
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
claims
that
are
made
with
respect
to
this
provision
seem
us
to
be
answered
by
the
cases
saying
that
reports
required
for
valid
regulatory
purposes
are
not
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
the
court
said,
“this
is
far
back
as
boyd
in
the
passage
that
we
refer
to.”
there
is
under
our
laws
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
bringing
things
in
to
and
out
of
the
country.
the
customs
laws
indicate
quite
the
contrary.
nor
is
there
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
with
respect
to
financial
transactions
in
bank
accounts
which
are
subject
to
in
this
country
to
the
internal
revenue
summons
--
procedures
and
to
other
processes
that
do
not
require
a
search
warrant
to
be
issued
initially
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
that
they
have
to
make
a
report
of
their
transactions
in
overseas
banks
just
as
they
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
if
he
engages
in
a
cash
transaction
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
would
have
to
be
$10,000.00
in
order
to
record
the
requirement
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
have
to
be
a
--
as
--
so
it
have
to
be
an
excess
of
$10,000.00.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
he
did
that
by
cash,
the
cash
transaction,
the
institution
--
the
bank
would
file
a
report
of
it.
i
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there's
nothing
to
keep
the
bank
telling
him
about
it
and
the
secretary
has
publicized
these
regulations
very
widely
and
has
held
press
conferences,
has
disseminated
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
what's
about
them
and
so
forth.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
one
could
as
reasonably
assume
that
when
the
bank
as
in
the
information
for
the
report,
the
bank
will
be
telling
you
why
they
need
this
information.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
--
the
house
committee
report
said
that.
we
don’t
believe
that
issue
is
before
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
that
issue
was
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
the
regulation
but
it's
not
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
wasn’t
--
what
was
indicated
in
the
commentary
that
the
department
received
as
the
reason
why
the
banks
thought
it
would
be
better
for
them
to
be
doing
it
themselves.
they
claim
that
it
would
be
an
impediment
to
the
expeditious
conduct
of
their
business
if
they
had
to
stop
and
drop
the
whole
reports
so
that
the
costumer
could
sign
it
while
the
costumer
was
present.
but
that
is
not
in
the
record.
this
is
information
developed
in
the
course
of
drafting
the
regulations
which
we
could've
introduced
in
the
district
court
if
the
issue
had
been
raised
in
the
district
court
but
which
it
was
not
and
we
don’t
think
its
here
for
decision
in
any
event.
and
i
must
--
there
are
further
questions,
our
submission
that
congress
faced
with
testimony
about
various
serious
problems
adopted,
a
very
restrained
method
of
enacting
legislation
that
was
necessary
and
proper
to
see
to
it
to
the
channels
of
commerce,
were
using
to
facilitate
rather
than
hinder
the
enforcement
of
various
tax,
regulatory
and
criminal
laws
and
it's
difficult
to
see
how
they
could've
done
anything
effective
that
would
be
more
restrained
than
what
they
have
done
in
the
enacting
--
implementing
regulations.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
so-called
bank
secrecy
act,
oh!
i
should
say
before
i
begin
that
i
asked
the
clerk
to
distribute
a
little
xerox
copy
because
the
regulations
as
they’re
reproduced
in
the
appendix
to
our
jurisdictional
statement
and
in
the
appendices
to
the
california
bankers
association
briefs
omitted
some
intervening
changes
which
made
them
inaccurate
in
minor
respects
that
don’t
affect
the
argument
in
this
case.
principally
103.35
is
the
one
that
can’t
really
be
reconstructed
without
the
aid
of
this,
but
with
these
in
your
hands
along
with
the
others,
it
will
be
possible
to
see
what
all
of
the
regulations
currently
are.
they
were
amended
in
both
december
of
1972
and
january
of
1973
and
the
current
regulations
are
reprinted
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations.
the
act
was
enacted
by
congress
in
1970,
following
extensive
and
detailed
hearings
concerning
the
wide
spread
use
made
by
persons
in
the
united
states
of
foreign
bank
accounts
in
bank
secrecy
jurisdictions
for
the
purpose
of
concealing
violations
of
the
united
states
tax
regulatory
and
criminal
laws
or
concealing
the
fruits
of
such
violations
and
concerning
the
difficulties
in
enforcing
federal
tax,
regulatory
and
criminal
laws
that
had
been
caused
by
the
failure
of
some
domestic
banks
and
other
financial
institutions
to
keep
adequate
records
of
checking
account
transactions
and
of
the
identity
of
their
costumers.
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
make
available
greater
evidence
of
financial
transactions
in
order
to
deter
the
use
of
the
channels
of
commerce
for
illicit
purposes.
or
in
the
words
of
the
senate
report,
“in
order
to
reduce
the
incidence
of
white
collar
crime.”
titles
i
and
ii
of
the
of
the
act
and
their
implementing
regulations
were
challenged
in
this
case.
title
i
is
the
recordkeeping
provisions
and
title
ii
are
the
reporting
provisions
which
basically
are
in
two
parts
for
purposes
of
our
concerns
here;
the
reports
of
domestic
currency
transactions
and
reports
of
foreign
financial
transactions.
the
act’s
provisions
are
not
self-executing,
but
are
designed
to
be
implemented
by
treasury
regulations.
congress
made
clear
its
intention
that
those
regulations
were
to
focus
both
the
recordkeeping
and
the
reporting
requirements
on
financial
information
having
a
--
in
the
phrase
of
both
the
house
committee
report
and
in
the
act
itself,
a
high
degree
of
usefulness
in
criminal
tax
or
regulatory
investigations
or
proceedings
and
by
self
focusing
the
requirements
to
avoid
undue
burdens
on
the
free
flow
of
domestic
and
international
commerce
and
finance.
after
the
act's
purpose
or
passage,
after
the
act’s
passage
in
keeping
with
this
congressional
purpose,
a
treasury
department
taskforce
undertook
a
detailed
study
in
consultation
with
representatives
of
financial
institutions,
of
trade
associations
and
of
government
agencies
to
determine
the
specific
categories
of
records
and
reports
which
should
be
required
to
implement
the
act
and
the
regulations
emanated
from
rulemaking
proceedings
involving
this
taskforce
studies.
they
were
first
adopted
in
april
of
1972
and
then
were
amended
in
december
of
that
year
and
in
january
of
1973,
after
further
comment
in
rulemaking
proceedings
and
also
in
light
of
further
senate
hearings
on
proposed
amendments
to
the
act
that
were
conducted
in
august
of
1972.
and
that
is
why
there
are
sometimes
citations
to
senate
hearings
which
discussed
the
regulations
that
have
already
been
developed
under
act.
those
proposed
amendments
had
to
do
with
proposals
to
restrict
access
to
the
records
which
congress
has
not
enacted,
but
the
amendments
to
the
regulations
do
specify
restrictions
on
access
by
others
in
the
government.
the
--
and
original
legislative
history
made
it
clear
that
the
recordkeeping
provisions
did
not
expand
access
from
it
was
under
established
legal
process.
now,
turning
first
to
the
recordkeeping
provisions
of
title
i
as
implemented
by
the
regulations
and
these
provisions
were
upheld
by
the
district
court,
these
require
financial
institutions
in
the
united
states
to
record
the
identities
of
their
account
holders
and
require
banks
to
make
--
to
maintain
microfilm
or
other
records
of
checks
drawn
on
them.
these
are
requirements
with
respect
to
“on
us
checks”
only
for
sums
in
excess
of
$100.00
dollars.
and
then,
there
are
--
in
addition
to
checks
for
$100.00
or
less,
there
are
other
exceptions
developed
and
these
are
in
the
amended
regulations
that
are
listed
on
page
22
of
the
brief,
this
is
our
brief
for
the
appellees.
there
are
a
number
of
briefs
in
the
case
as
you
know,
and
the
government
brief,
is
appellee
on
page
22,
we
summarize
the
other
exceptions,
dividend
checks
and
payroll
checks
and
others
so
long
as
they
are
drawn
on
an
account,
expected
to
average
at
least
$100.00
checks
per
month.
all
together
then,
that
was
exceptions
coupled
with
the
exception
for
all
checks
of
one
hundred
dollars
or
lees
add
up
to
a
very
substantial
exception
to
the
microfilming
requirements
which
have
been
the
main
focus
of
the
complainant’s
contentions
in
the
case.
the
additional
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
relativity
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there's
relatively
little
in
the
record
that
bears
on
this.
these
amendments
were
made
to
the
regulations
after
the
district
court
decision
in
this
case.
there
is
some
testimony
in
the
hearings
that
we
refer
to,
the
congressional
hearings
that
we
referred
to
in
our
brief
in
which
some
representatives
of
banking
institutions
made
suggestions
that
indicated
that
it
would
be
possible
and
in
one
instance
that
it
would
be
possible
by
machine
to
make
such
separations
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
at
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
fraudulent
practice
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
problem
in
practice
has
been
for
banks
to
microfilm
all
of
their
checks
and
of
course
for
banks
that
have
been
doing
that
even
though
they
have
not
been
retaining
those
microfilms
as
long
as
it
is
required
under
the
regulation
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
five
years
for
this
particular
aspect
of
it.
it's
two
years
in
which
to
reconstruct
entries
into
demand
accounts
in
the
bank,
but
for
the
microfilming
“on
us
checks,”
it's
five
years.
the
hearings
did
bring
out
that
most
of
the
banks
had
been
microfilming
their
checks
although
the
period
for
which
they
retained
them
has
varied
a
great
deal.
and
certainly
banks
that
have
been
microfilming
all
of
their
checks
would
be
likely
to
retain
all
of
their
checks
for
the
five-year
period
rather
than
have
to
sort
out
the
microfilms
afterwards.
the
regulations
developing
the
exceptions
were
developed
in
consultation
and
in
light
of
comments
by
members
of
the
industry.
and
while
there
is
nothing
in
public
record,
the
treasury
department
did
include
the
exception
in
response
to
industry
suggestion
that
this
would
be
a
useful
and
in
keeping
with
the
congressional
purpose,
not
to
cause
any
unnecessary
burdens
on
the
flow
of
commerce
that
substantially
contribute
to
the
purposes
of
the
act.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
what
banks
are
doing
since
the
adoption
of
the
regulations.
the
treasury
department
has
some
information,
however,
that
would
give
us
a
basis
for
introducing
evidence
in
a
proper
proceeding
that
this
is
a
useful
exception
from
some
institutions
and
that
it's
an
exception
that
they're
able
to
take
advantage
of.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
does
not
with
respect
to
any
of
this
requirements.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
neither
do
the
regulations.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
of
course,
it
doesn’t
specify
that
microfilm
has
to
be
the
process
by
which
a
copy
of
the
check
is
retained.
the
hearings
indicated
that
it
was
only
the
largest
institutions
that
were
getting
away
from
microfilming,
not
the
smaller
ones,
that
they
were
using
the
microfilming
process.
that
was
what
the
evidence
before
congress
appeared
to
indicate.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
it
chose
to,
it
could
under
the
regulations.
the
regulations
don’t
specify
the
form
in
which
copies
are
to
be
maintained
but
the
practice
of
small
banks
is
to
use
microfilm
and
the
main
reason
for
the
need
for
the
recordkeeping
requirements
brought
out
in
the
hearing
was
that
in
view
of
the
largest
banks
in
the
country
had
decided
not
to
engage
in
the
pervasive
photocopying
that
was
common
practice
in
the
industry
and
they
were
problems
about
periods
of
retention.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
a
testimony
about
the
need
and
the
usefulness
of
bank
records
in
aiding
investigations
both
to
determine
tax
liability.
there
was
a
testimony
by
the
internal
revenue
agents.
there
was
a
testimony
by
united
states
attorneys
indicating
in
detail
various
--
sometimes
quite
intricate
criminal
schemes
that
had
been
investigated
through
the
use
of
bank
records
and
problems
that
they
run
into
when
the
bank
records
were
not
available
and
there
was
testimony
by
the
assistant
attorney
general
in
charge
of
the
criminal
division
indicating
the
importance
of
having
such
records
available
for
use
in
evidence
in
trials,
rather
than
relying
on
oral
testimony.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
no
compensation
provided
in
the
act
or
the
regulations
your
honor.
the
findings
made
by
the
congressional
committees
were
that
these
requirements
would
not
impose
an
undue
burden
indeed
that
there
would
not
be
a
very
substantial
burden
imposed
on
most
banks
at
all
because
they
are
already
made
copies
of
these
records
for
their
own
purposes
and
extending
the
period
in
which
they
retain
them
in
considering
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
would
be
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
are
expenses.
there
was
a
testimony
in
the
hearings
about
the
expenses
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
testimony
was
that
the
cost
had
been
estimated
to
range
between
one
half
mill
and
one
and
a
half
mills
for
a
check,
a
mill
being
a
tenth
of
a
cent.
and
the
senate
committee
specifically
said
the
cost
of
microfilming
has
been
estimated
in
the
hearings,
to
range
between
½
of
the
mill
and
½
miles
for
check,
a
cost,
that
does
not
appear
to
be
unduly
onerous
compared
to
the
normal
service
charge
of
ten
cents
per
check.
and
across
which
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
recordkeeping
requirements
don’t
impose
any
additional
requirements
on
the
bank
with
respect
to
access
to
such
records
as
they
have
and
there
wasn’t
a
complete
cross
breakdown,
there
was
testimony
in
the
hearings
that
--
by
representatives
of
the
banking
industry
that
the
costs
would
not
be
unduly
onerous
and
the
costs
are
tax
deductible.
we
have
a
quotation
in
our
brief
on
that
precise
point
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
would
presume
so
although
there's
no
indication
that
anyone
has
raised
the
service
cost
from
ten
cents
to
ten
and
a
half
cents
check.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
are
provisions
for
civil
penalties
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
or
the
possibility
for
criminal
violations,
that
is
correct.
this
is
a
regulation
imposed
by
congress
on
them
as
something
they
have
to
meet
in
order
to
engaged
in
their
enterprise
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that’s
right.
the
congress
concluded
that
in
regulating
this
industry
which
provides
many
opportunities
for
evasion
of
other
legal
requirements
if
adequate
records
are
not
kept
of
the
identities
of
costumers
and
what
has
occurred
in
their
accounts
so
that’ll
be
available
when
legitimate
investigatory
needs
are
shown
that
this
is
part
of
the
burden
to
be
borne
as
a
good
citizen.
as
a
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
congress
has
imposed
a
great
many
recordkeeping
requirements
on
numerous
businesses
in
order
to
implement
various
federal
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that’s
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that’s
the
only
one
basis
that
these
provisions
are
also
needed
to
investigate
whether
internal
revenue
has
been
paid
adequately
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
focus
on
criminal
schemes
and
the
use
of
secret
accounts
to
conceal
the
fruits
of
criminal
schemes
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
secret
accounts
in
foreign
banks
and
getting
it
there
through
secret
transactions
in
united
states
banks
and
transactions
that
couldn’t
adequately
be
traced
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
bank
costumers
who
aren't
accurately
identified
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
are
you
speaking
of
the
privileging
against
self-incrimination?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
someone
is
being
required
to
incriminate
himself
and
pleads
the
privilege,
that
question
is
raised.
i
don’t
think
it's
raised
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
the
banks,
that
corporations
who
don’t
have
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
no
one
else
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
is
being
required
to
keep
a
record
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
he
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
haven’t
said
anything
about
giving
up
all
his
rights.
he
is
--
communicated
to
the
bank
what
that
check
communicates
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
he
has
a
right
to
uphold
the
confidentiality
of
that
communication
from
disclosure
that
would
arise
--
that
question
would
arise
when
an
attempt
was
made
to
get
the
bank
to
disclose
it.
this
court
said
in
the
couch
case
that
there
is
no
such
privilege.
that
maybe
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
all
he
meant
to
communicate
it
to
but
the
bank
can
be
compelled
to
testify
as
to
its
knowledge
of
what
he
communicated
to
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
neither
does
the
act.
the
act
gives
the
government
no
additional
access
to
any
records
required
to
be
kept,
no
access
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
if
they
don’t
have
a
normal
legal
process
of
a
summons
or
a
subpoena.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
reporting
provisions
are
something
else
and
i’ll
turn
to
those
now
with
just
--
if
i
may,
wanted
to
close
in
comments
about
the
recordkeeping
provisions.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so
that
we
--
won’t
need
to
return
to
them
unless
there
are
further
questions
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
the
major
thrust
of
it.
and
that
was
the
testimony.
it
was
just
a
very
few
of
the
largest
banks
that
had
decided
that
it
wasn’t
worth
their
while
to
photocopy
everything
and
to
keep
these
records
as
long
as
they
had
in
the
past.
in
fact
the
house
committee
report
said
that
most
banks
would
be
virtually
unaffected
by
this
particular
aspect
of
the
requirements
and
that
it
is
just
a
few
size
of
the
ones,
the
bank
of
america
was
particularly
testified
about
and
that
is
correct
your
honor.
so,
the
principle
as
we
understand
it,
of
the
california
bankers
association
argument
that
this
is
undue
burden
whether
that
stated
as
a
fourth
or
fifth
amendment
objection
and
it’s
hard
for
us
to
see
why
a
recordkeeping
requirement
is
a
search
or
seizure,
but
it
seems
to
us
it
has
to
be
more
a
fifth
amendment
objection.
that
is
answered
by
the
consideration,
it
seems
to
us
that
congress
gave
to
the
needs
that
the
government
had
as
a
necessary
improper
means
of
facilitating
enforcement
of
tax,
regulatory,
and
criminal
laws
that
this
would
not
be
undue
burden
and
i
don’t
think
this
congressional
judgment
as
been
shown
by
anything
presented
in
the
record
here
not
be
an
entirely
constitutional
one.
the
other
objections
that
had
been
raised
to
the
requirements
by
the
individuals,
if
i
can
just
summarize,
our
position
with
respect
to
them
quite
briefly,
we
don’t
see
that
there's
been
any
compulsion
on
the
individual
with
respect
to
the
recordkeeping
requirements
that
would
form
a
predicate
for
a
fifth
amendment
objection
nor
had
any
of
the
individuals
before
the
court
claimed
that
anything
required
would
tend
to
incriminate
them
which
is
a
necessary
predicate
for
a
fifth
amendment
objection.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
legislative
history
or
purpose
or
anything
that
was
developed
in
the
course
of
developing
the
regulations
for
belief
that
the
government
was
going
to
seek
to
get
the
membership
list
of
any
particular
organization
and
therefore
the
first
amendment
claim
seems
to
us
to
be
a
--
too
speculative
for
presentation
to
the
court,
a
fortiori
on
the
basis
of
this
court’s
decision
last
term
in
laird
against
tatum.
since
there
isn’t
even
any
data
gathering
by
the
government
yet
shown
to
be
taking
place
in
the
present
case
and
the
data
gathering
was
in
involved
in
laird
by
the
government
in
laird
against
tatum
although
no
use
of
that
data
printing
in
proper
or
likelihood
of
that
use
had
been
shown
of
the
fourth
amendment
claim
seems
to
me
that
there's
no
search
or
seizure
being
made
of
the
costumer
because
the
bank
with
whom
he’s
dong
with
business
is
required
to
keep
records
of
its
financial
transactions
with
him
and
other
costumers.
into
the
extent
that
--
it
could
be
said
and
we
suggest
some
reasons
why
it
may
not
be
accurate
to
say
so
that
the
bank
is
operating
as
a
government
agent,
it
is
never
been
held
by
any
court
to
my
knowledge
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
violative
when
the
government
keeps
records
of
its
dealings
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
the
same
sense,
that
is
right.
and
they're
required
to
keep
many
records
and
the
thrust
of
the
argument
of
the
individuals
here
is
that
when
they
have
dealings
with
the
government
and
the
government
keeps
records
of
those
transactions
that
the
government
has
engaged
in
assuming
that
the
bank
is
acting
as
an
agent
of
the
government
that
somehow
raises
a
fourth
amendment
violation
to
us.
that
is
merely
the
government’s
keeping
of
records
of
information
voluntarily
disclosed
to
the
government
by
someone
doing
business
with
it.
we
don’t
really
think
that
the
analogy
of
a
government
agent
is
the
accurate
one
here,
but
without
that
analogy
there's
no
search
or
seizure
with
respect
to
the
individual
at
all
here
since
there’
no
access
by
the
government
provided
by
the
act
to
the
records
that
are
required
to
be
kept.
now,
the
domestic
currency
transaction
reporting
provisions
of
title
ii
or
the
part
of
the
act
that
was
struck
down
by
the
district
court,
this
is
actually
the
least
innovative
feature
of
the
act
because
since
1945,
financial
institutions
have
been
providing
reports
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
and
implementing
regulations
and
also
under
section
2
of
51
of
the
revised
statutes
which
was
another
basis
for
those
regulations.
of
essentially
similar
information
and
these
had
been
of
proven
efficacy
in
the
enforcement
of
the
internal
revenue
laws.
treasury
report
indicative
for
example
that
in
1957
and
1958
alone,
129
fraud
cases
have
been
developed
involving
--
which
led
to
the
generation
of
13
and
a
half
million
dollars
in
additional
taxes
in
penalties
based
directly
on
information
derived
from
these
reports.
and
the
congressional
objective
in
providing
for
such
reporting
requirements
in
the
new
act
was
to
make
the
standards
for
such
reports
by
the
institutions
more
definite.
the
hearings
indicated
that
the
criminal
use
of
financial
institutions
had
increased
in
recent
years
and
there
was
much
testimony
and
findings
in
the
committee
reports
indicating
that
large
amounts
of
cash
are
generated
and
have
to
be
concealed
in
illicit
transactions
and
also
have
to
be
converted
to
assure
the
ultimate
success
of
those
transactions
into
usable
forms
of
credit.
and
so
these
provisions
in
their
implementing
regulations
were
included
in
the
act
and
these
regulations
require
reports
only
by
the
financial
institutions
of
these
transactions
not
by
any
individuals
and
only
of
currency
transactions
in
excess
of
$10,000.00
and
not
commensurate
with
the
customary
conduct
of
the
business
of
an
established
costumer
of
the
bank.
the
information
to
reported
is
summarized
in
our
brief,
this
time,
it's
--
our
brief
as
appellant,
on
pages
14
and
15
in
the
text
of
the
brief.
the
information
is
relatively
simple
and
its
to
be
secured
from
the
party
to
the
transaction,
the
other
party,
the
transaction
by
the
bank
as
a
condition
of
the
banks
engaging
in
such
transactions.
and
this
is
again
a
regulation
of
the
activities
of
the
banks
in
commerce.
the
district
court
--
the
rationale
of
the
district
court
in
striking
down
these
provisions
of
the
act
was
as
we
have
contended
in
detail
in
our
brief
entirely
hypothetical.
it
was
based
on
the
speculation
that
it
might
be
possible
to
have
implementing
regulations
which
would
require
the
reporting
of
other
transactions,
other
than
those
specified
in
the
regulations
including
the
reporting
of
all
transactions
by
check
on
--
personal
checking
accounts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
these
are
transactions
--
one
example
was
given
by
mr.
justice
brennan
if
he
should
get
$15,000.00
in
currency
just
by
presenting
a
check
and
asking
for
that
much
currency
although
the
denominations
of
the
smaller
bills
would
not
have
to
be
reported
on
the
reporting
form,
that
was
the
only
exception
i
would
take
to
the
description
that
was
made.
it's
only
bills
of
a
hundred
dollars
and
over
that
must
be
mentioned
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
i
get
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
that’s
the
--
the
form
itself
does
not
require
all
of
that.
it's
in
our
jurisdiction
of
statement
on
page
121
and
the
denomination
there,
we
were
just
summarizing
it
on
pages
14
and
15.
the
amount
has
to
be
given
and
then
the
amount
in
denominations
of
$100.00
or
higher,
the
form
is
relatively
concise,
but
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
too
would
be
a
currency
transaction
to
be
reported.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
it
would
be
for
currency
or
other
bearer
instrument
transactions
such
as
a
bank
check
made
out
to
cash
or
something
of
the
sort
which
anybody
could
cash,
a
bearer
instrument
that
has
the
same
negotiability
as
currency,
virtually
the
same
that’s
what
these
are
involved
with.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
i
understand
that
that
would
be
adequate.
these
reports
has
been
purposely
kept
relatively
simple
with
the
idea
that
if
an
internal
revenue,
or
if
it
is
called
for,
of
course
they’ll
be
getting
into
more
detail
then
and
if
there
isn’t,
there
is
no
point
in
burgeoning
transactions
with
onerous
requirements.
a
great
deal
of
time
has
been
devoted
to
developing
the
regulations
and
forms.
the
regulations
didn’t
take
effect
until
two
years
after
the
act
was
passed
because
of
the
efforts
that
were
made.
there
was
an
overriding
congressional
purpose
not
to
cause
unnecessary
burdens
on
the
flow
of
these
transactions.
there
is
a
--
one
aspect
of
the
domestic
currency
transaction
reporting
provisions
that
i
should
devote
a
few
minutes
to
because
it’s
a
problem
that
has
been
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
case,
in
the
briefs
for
the
appellees
filed
not
long
ago
in
the
case
and
that
is
a
contention
that
the
regulation,
a
contention
made
in
the
red
covered
brief
by
the
bankers
association
that
the
regulation
is
invalid
implementing
this
provision
because
it
doesn’t
require
a
report
to
be
made
by
the
costumers
as
well
as
the
bank
and
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
did
contemplate
and
indeed
the
act
required
the
report
to
be
made
by
both
parties
in
order
to
assure
that
the
costumer
would
be
notified.
this
contention
it
seems
to
us
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case.
it's
raised
by
the
california
bankers
association,
its
on
pages
37
through
39
of
their
red
covered
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
received
--
and
in
on
january
5th
in
our
office.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
--
there
was
a
white
covered
brief
that
was
identical
to
it
and
then
the
red
covered
briefs
were
substituted
for
it.
it
might
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
brief
for
the
appellee,
california
bankers
association.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it’s
the
same
as
the
white
covered
brief.
its
exactly
the
same
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
its
no
pages
37
through
39.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that’s
the
same
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that’s
the
same
brief.
the
printer
had
been
instructed
to
bind
it
in
red
and
had
it
bound
it
in
white
and
sent
it
to
them,
and
then
he
sent
substitute
copies
but
they're
all
--
there's
no
change
inside
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
37
through
39,
a
contention
is
made
that
the
regulation
is
invalid
because
it
requires
only
the
financial
institution
to
file
the
report
whereas
the
act
contemplated
that
the
regulation
would
require
both
the
institution
and
the
costumer
to
file
the
report.
we
don’t
believe
this
contention
is
properly
before
the
court
because
its
made
here
by
the
bankers
association
who
are
obviously
not
within
the
zone
of
interest
to
be
protected
under
their
own
contention
which
was
assurance
that
the
costumer
would
be
notified
as
the
congressionally
stated
purpose
of
requiring
both
to
file
the
report.
there
is
nothing
to
stop
the
california,
the
members
of
the
california
bankers
association
from
notifying
their
costumers
when
they
file
such
reports
either
in
person
at
the
time
the
information
is
secured
or
by
sending
the
costumer
a
copy
of
the
report
or
indeed
by
having
the
costumer
countersign
the
report
which
is
not
required
by
the
treasury
regulations,
but
the
report
would
still
be
accepted
by
the
treasury
if
it
were
filed
that
way.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
--
when
you
say
the
statute
is
unambiguous
mr.
justice
stewart,
let
me
look
at
the
statute
at
the
bottom
of
page
37.
the
report
of
any
transaction
required
to
be
reported
under
this
chapter
shall
be
signed
or
otherwise
made.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
both.
well,
of
course
the
information
is
secured
by
the
bank
from
the
costumer
and
the
otherwise
made
language
was
believed
by
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
that
there
are
other
--
additional
provisions
of
the
act
that
are
--
have
a
bearing,
namely
section
206
of
the
act
which
gives
the
secretary
broad
authority,
this
is
in
our
jurisdictional
statement
on
page
80
which
gives
the
secretary
broad
authority
to
make
exceptions
to
the
requirements
of
the
act
as
he
sees
fit
in
developing
the
regulations
and
another
answer
is
that
while
the
house
committee
report
interpreted
this
language
as
requiring
the
report
to
be
made
by
both
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
excerpt
from
that
committee
report
set
out
at
page
38
of
the
brief.
the
senate
committee
took
exact
to
the
contrary
view
and
this
is
not
set
out
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
appellees.
we
didn’t
want
to
burden
the
court
with
an
additional
reply
brief
because
we
didn’t
think
the
issue
is
in
the
case
to
begin
with.
since
there
is
no
withstanding
duress
of
the
individuals
in
the
case,
they
don’t
claim
that
they
engage
in
the
transactions
of
this
type
that
that
they
contemplate
engaging
in
such
transactions.
the
senate
committee
report
with
respect
to
exactly
the
same
statutory
language,
i’m
quoting
out
from
page
15
of
the
brief,
took
exactly
the
opposite
view
in
analyzing
the
domestic
currency
reporting
requirements.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
not
a
brief,
sir.
this
is
page
15
of
the
senate
committee
report
which
is
not
before
the
court,
but
is
available
to
the
court
and
i’ll
read
the
entire
paragraph
since
its
quite
short
and
it’s
the
only
part
dealing
with
the
analysis
of
the
domestic
currency
reporting
provisions.
“these
sections
authorize
the
secretary
to
require
reports
on
transactions
in
currency
or
other
monetary
instruments
involving
domestic
financial
institutions
when
the
transactions
are
in
such
amounts
or
under
such
circumstances
as
the
secretary
may
proscribe.
the
reports
can
be
required
of
the
financial
institution
or
the
party
involved
or
both.
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
designate
domestic
financial
institutions
as
agents
of
the
united
states
to
receive
required
reports.”
that
is
section
223
which
is
never
implemented
and
that
is
the
analysis
given
in
the
senate
committee
report.
but
the
question
is
one
that
the
secretary
gave
a
lot
of
attention
to
in
developing
the
regulations.
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
did
based
on
comments
that
were
made
by
the
industry
as
to
the
cumbersomeness
of
the
process
if
they
had
to
get
their
costumers
to
file
reports
of
such
transactions
and
in
light
of
the
overall
congressional
purpose
of
not
imposing
unnecessary
burdens
on
commerce,
the
secretary
concluded
that
--
and
the
exemption
authority
given
him
should
be
utilized
here
and
that
the
purposes
of
the
act
would
adequately
be
served.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
the
house
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
regulation
does
require
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
precisely
what
the
house
report
said.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
precisely
what
the
house
report
said
and
it
was
contradicted
by
the
senate
report
dealing
with
exactly
the
same
language
in
the
act.
the
conference
report
said
nothing
about
it,
it
just
adopted
the
same
language.
both
reports
are
referring
to
the
same
language
and
they're
just
--
i
don’t
think
the
issue
is
before
the
court
in
the
case
and
for
that
reason
we
haven’t
briefed
it.
it
wasn’t
even
introduced
in
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court.
there
wasn’t
an
objection
raised
at
that
time.
the
only
basis
on
which
the
individuals
before
the
court
claimed
that
they
can
race
the
issue,
is
not
that
they
have
engaged
or
contemplate
engaging
in
this
cash
transactions,
but
that
the
act
as
a
whole
is
not
separable
and
that
if
this
invalid,
the
parts
that
concern
them
are
invalid.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
concerns
expressed
by
congress
about
why
they
needed
to
have
the
various
provisions
pretty
well
refute
the
contention
if
the
court
found
one
aspect
of
it
to
be
invalid
that
it
should
strike
down
the
entire
act,
indeed
the
fact
that
a
substantially
similar,
domestic
reporting
provisions
antedated
the
act
under
the
trading
with
the
enemy
act
and
stood
alone
for
many
years
indicates
that
congress
didn’t
think
all
of
these
had
to
be
one
package.
now,
i’d
like
to
say
just
a
few
words
about
the
foreign
transaction
reporting
provisions
of
title
ii
in
their
implementing
regulations
which
were
upheld
by
the
court
below
and
which
require
reports
of
the
transactions
of
the
individuals
here
do
say
they
engage
in
of
transportations
of
monetary
instruments
involving
more
than
$5,000.00
into
or
out
of
the
united
states
and
reports
by
persons
in
the
united
states
of
their
relationships
with
foreign
financial
institutions.
much
of
the
testimony
developed
in
the
hearings
was
concerned
with
the
very
serious
problems
caused
by
the
concealing
or
purifying
of
fruits
of
domestic
criminal
activity
in
the
concealing
of
on
going
violations
of
tax,
regulatory
and
criminal
laws
by
the
use
of
secret
bank
accounts
in
a
bank
secrecy
jurisdictions,
accounts
over
which
congress
does
not
have
direct
regulatory
authority.
the
examples
given
were
detailed
and
varied
of
the
evasions
of
capital
gains
taxes
through
sales
of
security
of
illegal
trading
in
gold,
the
concealing
of
securities
manipulations,
the
concealing
of
insider
trading
in
securities
and
numerous
other
examples,
a
man
making
a
loan
to
himself
from
his
own
secret
bank
account
and
then
deducting
the
interest
payments
that
it
is
one
that
i
recall
from
the
hearings.
it
was
testified
by
robert
morgan
thaw
(ph),
former
united
states
attorney
of
the
southern
district
of
new
york
that
in
his
estimation,
thousands
of
such
accounts
involving
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
were
being
used
for
illicit
purposes
and
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue,
randolph
thrower
testified
that
the
integrity
of
the
self-assessment
system
of
the
taxation
itself
was
being
threatened
by
the
use
of
these
accounts.
the
objections
that
have
been
raised
to
this
are
first
of
all
a
claim
that
there
might
be
a
problem
under
the
self-incrimination
provision
of
the
fifth
amendment.
we
don’t
believe
that
claim
is
before
the
court
because
no
one
in
court
has
said
that
filing
such
a
report
would
tend
to
incriminate
him
which
is
the
prerequisite
for
raising
any
claim
of
privilege
under
the
fifth
amendment.
and
in
any
event
the
claim
would
be
premature.
these
are
reports
to
be
filed
with
the
internal
revenue
return
itself
and
under
the
sullivan
case,
the
claim
should
be
made
--
it's
going
to
be
made
on
the
return
and
under
marchetti
and
grosso,
even
if
there
was
something
so
inherently
incriminating
here
that
the
individual
would
be
justified
in
not
filing
any
report
at
all.
that
would
not
mean
that
they’re
entitled
to
the
kind
of
relief
they
have
sought
in
this
case
which
is
invalidating
the
entire
act
because
others
might
well
be
able
to
comply
without
incriminating
themselves
and
indeed
it's
very
likely
that
couriers
and
others
would
comply.
the
marchetti
and
grosso
cases
both
specifically
said
the
tax
there
was
not
being
struck
down.
they
were
merely
upholding
a
valid
claim
of
privilege
made
by
someone
who
showed
that
he
couldn’t
file
the
report
required
without
incriminating
himself.
and
the
fourth
amendment
and
the
claims
that
are
made
with
respect
to
this
provision
seem
us
to
be
answered
by
the
cases
saying
that
reports
required
for
valid
regulatory
purposes
are
not
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
the
court
said,
“this
is
far
back
as
boyd
in
the
passage
that
we
refer
to.”
there
is
under
our
laws
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
bringing
things
in
to
and
out
of
the
country.
the
customs
laws
indicate
quite
the
contrary.
nor
is
there
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
with
respect
to
financial
transactions
in
bank
accounts
which
are
subject
to
in
this
country
to
the
internal
revenue
summons
--
procedures
and
to
other
processes
that
do
not
require
a
search
warrant
to
be
issued
initially
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
that
they
have
to
make
a
report
of
their
transactions
in
overseas
banks
just
as
they
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
if
he
engages
in
a
cash
transaction
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
would
have
to
be
$10,000.00
in
order
to
record
the
requirement
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
have
to
be
a
--
as
--
so
it
have
to
be
an
excess
of
$10,000.00.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
he
did
that
by
cash,
the
cash
transaction,
the
institution
--
the
bank
would
file
a
report
of
it.
i
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there's
nothing
to
keep
the
bank
telling
him
about
it
and
the
secretary
has
publicized
these
regulations
very
widely
and
has
held
press
conferences,
has
disseminated
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
what's
about
them
and
so
forth.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
one
could
as
reasonably
assume
that
when
the
bank
as
in
the
information
for
the
report,
the
bank
will
be
telling
you
why
they
need
this
information.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
--
the
house
committee
report
said
that.
we
don’t
believe
that
issue
is
before
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
that
issue
was
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
the
regulation
but
it's
not
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
wasn’t
--
what
was
indicated
in
the
commentary
that
the
department
received
as
the
reason
why
the
banks
thought
it
would
be
better
for
them
to
be
doing
it
themselves.
they
claim
that
it
would
be
an
impediment
to
the
expeditious
conduct
of
their
business
if
they
had
to
stop
and
drop
the
whole
reports
so
that
the
costumer
could
sign
it
while
the
costumer
was
present.
but
that
is
not
in
the
record.
this
is
information
developed
in
the
course
of
drafting
the
regulations
which
we
could've
introduced
in
the
district
court
if
the
issue
had
been
raised
in
the
district
court
but
which
it
was
not
and
we
don’t
think
its
here
for
decision
in
any
event.
and
i
must
--
there
are
further
questions,
our
submission
that
congress
faced
with
testimony
about
various
serious
problems
adopted,
a
very
restrained
method
of
enacting
legislation
that
was
necessary
and
proper
to
see
to
it
to
the
channels
of
commerce,
were
using
to
facilitate
rather
than
hinder
the
enforcement
of
various
tax,
regulatory
and
criminal
laws
and
it's
difficult
to
see
how
they
could've
done
anything
effective
that
would
be
more
restrained
than
what
they
have
done
in
the
enacting
--
implementing
regulations.
