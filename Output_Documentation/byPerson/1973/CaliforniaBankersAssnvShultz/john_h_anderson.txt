mr.
john
h.
anderson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
john
anderson
and
i
represent
in
these
consolidated
cases,
the
california
bankers
association.
these
consolidated
cases
entail
a
challenge
to
an
act
of
congress
passed
late
in
1970
that
has
become
to
be
known
as
the
bank
secrecy
act.
and
in
our
discussions
today,
i
think
that
initially
important
to
distinguish
as
much
as
we
can
at
all
times
between
the
two
aspects
of
that
act.
one
aspect
to
that
act
entails
and
requires
the
banks
uninsured
and
otherwise
of
this
nation
to
microfilm
and
copy
virtually
every
piece
of
paper
that
flows
through
the
domestic
banking
system
and
to
keep
that
paper
microfilmed
before
a
period
ranging
from
two
to
five
years.
the
second
part
of
the
act,
title
ii
requires
banks
to
make
reports
of
certain
kinds
of
designated
currency
transactions,
domestic
and
foreign.
with
that
background
in
mind
and
in
june
of
1972,
the
private
litigants
in
this
case
initiated
in
an
action
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
seeking
to
enjoin
enforcement
of
both
the
recordkeeping
and
the
reporting
sections
of
the
bank
secrecy
act.
with
one
judge
dissenting
a
three-judge
court
denied
motions
to
enjoin
enforcements
of
the
recordkeeping
section
of
the
act
but
granted
an
injunction
enjoining
enforcement
of
the
automatic
reporting
provisions
of
the
act.
the
government
has
appealed
from
that
portion
of
that
order
enjoining
enforcement
of
the
reporting
provisions.
the
private
litigants
have
appealed
from
that
portion
of
the
order
refusing
to
enjoin
the
so
called
recordkeeping
sections.
let
me
begin
with
a
very
brief
summary
description
of
just
what
those
record
--
excuse
me,
reporting
provisions
entail.
the
act
compels
reports
of
all
domestic
currency
transactions
found
by
the
secretary
“have
a
high
degree
of
usefulness
in
criminal,
tax
or
regulatory
investigatings
--
investigations
or
proceedings.”
the
implementing
regulations
currently
enforced
require
banks
among
others
to
report
automatically
all
$10,000.00
currency
transactions.
and
i
should
interject
here
that
when
i
say
currently
enforced
i
use
the
phrase
advisably
because
the
act
authorizes
and
the
regulations
following
through
on
that
authorize
a
change
in
that
dollar
amount
or
in
fact
the
definition
of
transaction
at
any
time
by
the
treasury
secretary.
the
transaction
report
of
the
currency
transaction
requires
disclosure
of
a
wide
variety
of
information,
including
the
name,
address
and
business
or
profession
of
the
party
involved
in
the
transaction,
the
name,
address
and
business
of
the
party
or
business
entity
for
whom
it
may
have
been
conducted
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
no.
this
is
a
currency
transaction
mr.
justice
brennan
which
is
defined
in
the
regulations
as
being
cash
or
near
cash
monetary
instruments.
it
does
not
entail
for
example
a
situation
in
which
a
person
would
go
into
a
bank
and
simply
deposit
a
check
and
not
take
out
any
currency.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
that
would
included
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
listing
the
requirements
that
must
be
reported
at
the
time
of
a
designated
transaction,
it
requires
a
description
of
the
nature
of
the
transaction
whatever
that
means
together
with
the
tight
amount
and
denomination
of
the
currency
involved
and
a
description
of
any
check
involved
in
the
transaction.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
that
is
also
correct.
let
me
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
and
it
also
requires
a
description,
as
i
say,
the
check
involved
also
a
description
of
the
id
that
is
presented
by
the
party
seeking
to
engage
in
the
transaction.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
this
presumably
means
something
like
a
driver’s
license
or
a
birth
certificate
or
some
other
form
of
identification
that
would
be
acceptable
to
the
banking
entity.
now,
there
is
an
exception
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
that
is
not
further
defined
in
the
regulations
mr.
justice.
however,
i
will
like
to
interject
in
one
time,
there
is
an
exception
to
the
reporting
requirements.
the
exception
itself
is
the
basis
for
one
of
our
challenges
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
act
and
it
reads
in
words
in
effect
to
the
following
proposition
that
“if
the
bank
in
its
judgment
decides
that
this
transaction
is
normal
and
regular
for
the
person
engaging
in
it,
i.e.
perhaps
of
a
store
which
deals
in
large
amount
of
cash
that
it
need
be
reported.
however,
we
submit
that
the
description
is
so
vague
as
to
leave
the
banks
in
a
position
of
not
knowing
when
in
fact
a
prescribed
transaction
has
occurred
and
since
in
fact
there
are
criminal
penalties,
attendant
refusal
or
failure
to
give
the
report,
it
raises
a
serious
due
process
notice
problem
in
our
mind.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan,
however
it
has
to
be
said
that
the
regulation
is
couched
in
terms
of
regular
and
normal
for
the
business
or
profession
involved,
i
suppose
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
that
is
true.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
i
don’t
know,
frankly,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
the
--
my
the
advice
to
the
bank
in
that
particular
instance
would
be
in
view
of
fact
that
criminal
penalties
attach
failure
to
make
a
report
as
required
by
the
act
that
it
is
in
your
best
interest
to
act
cautiously
and
to
make
the
report
if
you
have
any
reason
to
believe
this
is
not
and
regular
for
this
particular
party.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
yes
i
think
we
certainly
would,
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
yes.
the
banks
of
course
are
free
to
report
all
transactions.
however,
the
--
our
objection
to
the
reporting
requirement
is
not
vagueness
and
as
such.
our
objections
run
to
the
fourth
amendment
problem
which
i’ll
get
to
if
i
--
if
i
may
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
well,
it
is
simply
to
say
that
in
every
instance
that
whenever
a
$10,000.00
currency
transaction
occurs
of
which
they
are
in
the
case
of
large
commercial
banks,
presumably
many
hundred
a
day,
that
a
report
would
be
required
to
be
filed
and
i
think
my
brother
from
the
solicitor
general's
office
would
agree
that’s
not
what
the
treasury
department
wants.
it
wants
reports
of
transactions
which
in
the
judgment
of
the
bank
are
unusual
for
that
particular
depositor.
the
result
otherwise
would
be
a
simple
inundation
of
the
treasury
department
with
reports,
which
it
presumably
couldn’t
use
and
would
be
useless
to
the
extent
of
95%.
so
i
--
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
i’d
have
to
answer
in
that
fashion.
the
summary
with
respect
to
the
reporting
obligation
i
think
can
be
put
as
simply
this,
that
when
the
transaction
occurred,
the
banks
by
some
fashion
are
obligated
to
obtain
a
wide
variety
of
information,
about
that
transaction
which
in
the
absence
of
the
compulsion
under
this
act,
they
would
under
no
circumstances
need
for
their
own
banking
purposes,
this
is
an
obligation
imposed
by
the
government.
now,
turning
to
a
very
brief
summary
description
of
the
recordkeeping,
the
act
makes
a
finding
of
adequate
records,
have
a
high
degree
of
usefulness
in
the
same
words;
criminal,
tax
and
regulatory
investigations
or
proceedings.
it
makes
a
further
finding
that
microfilm
or
other
copies
of
bank
records
are
highly
useful
and
the
act
then
provides
that,
and
i
am
quoting
now
“where
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
determines
that
the
maintenance
of
appropriate
types
of
records
and
other
evidence
by
insured
banks
has
a
high
degree
of
usefulness
in
criminal,
tax
or
regulatory
investigations
or
proceedings,
he
shall
prescribe
records
--
regulations
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
act.”
now,
the
regulations
and
alleged
implementation
of
foregoing
purposes
of
the
act
have
required
the
banks
of
the
united
states
to
copy
and
to
retain
as
i
have
said
for
a
period
of
--
from
two
to
five
years,
virtually
every
single
piece
of
paper
that
finds
it
way
into
the
american
domestic
banking
system
with
two
exceptions.
one
exception
has
to
do
with
payroll
checks
emanating
from
a
large
payroll.
the
catch
at
this
point
of
course
is
that
although
they're
not
recorded
at
the
issuing
point,
they
would
be
recorded
as
they
go
into
the
presumably
the
account
of
the
payee.
the
second
exception
is
for
checks
of
under
$100.00
in
amount.
the
catch
here
is,
first
that
the
bank
microfilming
equipment
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
and
although
we
had
no
chance
to
prove
this
in
the
--
at
the
district
court
because
this
amendment
was
made
after
this
--
the
district
court
decision,
but
the
obligation
not
to
copy
checks
under
a
hundred
dollars
is
of
little
or
no
practical
use
to
the
bank
because
the
microfilm
equipment
simply
can’t
distinguish
between
$100.00
checks
and
$1,000.00
checks.
now,
i
will
not
read
before
the
court
at
this
point,
all
of
the
documents
that
are
required
to
be
copied.
i
submit,
however,
that
a
reading
of
the
regulations,
quoted
on
pages
38
and
39,
excuse
me,
of
the
appendix
will
confirm
our
contention
that
this
act
requires
banks
to
copy
and
to
retain
for
a
period
of
two
to
five
years,
every
single
piece
of
paper
that
is
submitted
into
the
american
domestic
banking
system
in
any
formal
sense,
including
such
things
as
deposit
slips,
withdrawal
slips
and
other
advises
to
the
bank.
now
the
next
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
i’m
referring
to
pages
38
and
39
of
the
appendix
in
the
red
colored
brief
or
in
the
blue
colored
brief.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
yes.
that
is
the
section
of
the
regulations
that
are
set
forth
both
in
the
blue
colored
and
in
the
red
colored
brief.
the
purposes
of
the
act
are
not
in
dispute.
the
main
undisputed
purpose
of
the
bank
secrecy
act
was
to
aid
in
the
detection
of
what
the
government
calls,
white
collared
crimes
and
the
government
has
repeatedly
described
the
act
in
the
-
in
that
language.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
yes.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
with
respect
to
copying
of
documents,
the
bank
practices
as
alleged
in
the
district
court
uncontroverted
varies
very
wildly.
some
banks
keep
an
enormous
number
of
records
for
a
short
time.
other
banks
keep
a
small
number
of
records
for
a
long
time
and
they
are
all
numerous
in
between
positions
occupied
by
the,
bank.
the
uncontrovered
evidence
in
the
district
court
was
that
the
bank
of
america,
as
an
example
which
is
commonly
regarded
as
america’s
bank
did
not
keep
more
than
half
of
the
newly
prescribed
documents.
for
example,
did
not
keep
checks
for
a
two
years,
did
not
keep
various
other
documents
for
five
years
and
so
forth.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
mr.
justice
powell
i
think
that
was
a
question
mr.
justice
white
was
just
asking
and
the
evidence
in
the
district
court
was
that
the
practice
varied
enormously
from
bank
to
bank.
and
that
for
example
in
the
bank
of
america
to
which
you
referred
which
there
was
some
little
evidence
in
the
district
court,
the
evidence
was
that
yes,
they
did
microfilm
some
checks,
but
they
only
kept
them
for
a
period
of
from
10,
to
30
or
40
days
for
their
own
convenience
and
for
purposes
of
dispute
with
depositor
with
respect
to
payment
amounts
and
so
forth.
the
regulations
under
this
act
require
the
banks
to
film,
first
of
all,
all
the
checks
and
secondly
to
keep
them
for
a
minimum
of
tow
years.
so,
that’s
the
case
with
the
bank
of
america.
but
i
think
the
central
point
that
has
to
be
made
at
this
point
is
this,
that
absent,
these
requirements
of
recordkeeping,
the
practice
among
the
banks
of
the
united
states
varies
very
widely.
some
keep
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
no,
i’m
referring
to
the
practice
nationally,
it
is
certainly
the
case
in
california
also.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
mr.
justice
blackmun
my
information
is
that
it
is
quite
broad
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
these
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
there's
nothing
in
evidence
on
that
on
the
record,
that
is
correct.
the
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
that
is
not
--
that
is
simply
not
the
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
primary
reasons
for
this
legislation
given
by
the
government
at
the
time
it
was
being
proposed
was
that
banks
did
not
keep
the
records,
and
therefore,
they
found
it
difficult
when
subpoenaing
records
in
the
investigation
of
certain
alleged
crimes
to
obtain
the
records
in
question
and
it
was
--
that
was
part
of
the
purposes
or
motivation
for
this.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
no
i
--
i
may
have
misspoke
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
believe
i
said
that
they
keep
microfilms
of
checks
for
a
short
period
of
time
ranging
from
10
to
30,
some
odd
days.
there
is
an
affidavit
in
the
appendix
describing
the
bank
of
america’s
practice
on
this
point
as
an
example
and
it
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
no.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
the
practice
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
evidenced
by
an
affidavit
and
contested
in
the
record
is
that
they
microfilm
the
check
and
the
original
is
returned
to
the
payor
in
the
normal
course
of
banking
operations.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
yes.
they
return
to
the
bank
which
is
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
h.
anderson
yes.
that’s
correct.
that’s
right,
all
checks.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
no,
i
don’t
think.
i
think
there
is
a
substantial
difference,
legal
difference
between
a
compulsion
to
keep
checks
under
order
of
law
as
under
a
statute
and
records
or
checks
that
are
kept
in
the
ordinary
course
of
banking
business
for
the
bank's
own
purposes.
and
secondly
although
we
talk
mainly
about
checks,
i
again
respectfully
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
that
exhaustive
list
of
documents
which
are
required
to
be
kept
and
which
are
listed
on
pages
38
and
39
of
the
appendix,
neither
the
red
nor
the
blue
colored
brief.
now,
as
i
have
said
the
undisputed
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
well,
first
of
all,
that
turns
to
the
real
question
which
are
our
basic
legal
objections
to
the
recordkeeping
requirements
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
well,
i
--
watching
the
time
because
we
have
a
split
argument,
mr.
justice
brennan.
let
me
move
to
that
because
i
do
think
it
bears
some
discussion
here.
the
recordkeeping
is
in
our
judgment
unconstitutional
for
three
rather
specific
reasons.
first
of
all,
in
a
quick
summary,
an
analysis
of
those
cases
which
this
court
has
considered
dealing
with
compulsory
or
required
recordkeeping
will
show
that
they
have
been
in
aid
of
a
specific
legislative,
to
use
a
broader
word,
national
goal.
for
example,
wages
and
price
--
wage
in
our
laws,
emergency
price
regulation
or
the
tax
laws
are
classic
examples
in
which
there
is
a
specific
congressional
purpose
in
which
the
congress
has
approved
recordkeeping,
recognizing
i
would
suppose
that
the
recordkeeping
as
such
imposes
some
burden
on
the
citizenry
so
the
question
always
in
looking
at
the
statute
is,
does
this
recordkeeping
requirement
commensurate
with
the
legislative
objective.
here
the
court
will
respectfully
note
that
this
is
not
in
a
--
of
any
specific
congressional
goal
or
any
specific
congressional
policy.
it
is
in
aid
of
all
government
policy,
criminal,
civil,
tax,
regulatory,
investigative
or
a
proceeding
which
presumably
means
administrative
rulemaking.
it
is
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
i
think
it
violated
in
two
specific
instances
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
first
of
all,
it
removes
the
ability
of
this
court
to
weigh
the
recordkeeping
against
a
specific
government
need
therefore
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
well,
there
is
a
requirement
beginning
with
the
first
recordkeeping
case
of
consequent,
morton
salt
versus
the
united
states
in
which
the
court
says
that
you
could
--
can
be
required
to
keep
record
providing
that
it
is
reasonable
and
they
bear
some
reasonable
relation
to
a
legitimate
congressional
or
government
goal.
now,
i
submit
to
this
court
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
no,
that
was
a
fourth
amendment.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
i
think
mr.
justice
white,
i
am
at
it.
i
think
i
have
gone
through
to
it
by
coming
to
the
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
well,
it
is
a
fourth
amendment
objection,
that
is
correct,
but
it
refers
both
to
the
recordkeeping
and
the
reporting.
if
i
may
return
to
the
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist
raised
with
respect
to
what's
wrong
with
that
kind
of
a
recordkeeping
as
such,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
when
the
legi
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
--
the
congress
has
said
our
objective
is
all
purpose,
namely,
all
government
business,
criminal,
civil,
regulatory
and
otherwise
and
you
cannot
weigh
that
against
the
recordkeeping
objection.
there
is
no
way
that
you
can
follow
the
test
or
the
benchmark
given
in
the
morton
salt
case,
namely
that
it
has
some
reasonable
relationship
because
for
example,
if
congress
were
to
pass
a
new
criminal
statute
the
next
year,
you
wouldn’t
know
what
it
was
and
you
wouldn’t
be
able
to
equate
it
against
the
recordkeeping
obligation
which
is
imposed
today.
now
the
second
thing
which
i
believe
to
be
more
serious
is
the
--
that
analysis
of
the
recordkeeping
cases
approved
by
this
court
would
show
that
they
serve
one
of
two
purposes
either
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
record
keeper.
a
classic
example
would
be
a
requirement
that
employers’
report
wages
and
hours
pay
so
that
the
waging
(voice
overlap)
laws
could
be
enforced
or
child
labor
laws
could
be
enforced.
price
control
is
another
example
in
which
the
vendor
is
required
to
indicate
which
charge
--
prices
he
is
charging
for
his
items,
these
are
essential
to
regulate
the
record
keeper.
the
second
category
which
this
court
has
considered
have
been
though
--
that
kind
of
recordkeeping
required
to
regulate
a
particular
business.
two
examples;
firearms
dealers
in
which
there
is
a
requirement
that
records
to
be
kept
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
that
particular
business
which
is
deemed
by
the
congress
to
be
dangerous
or
to
have
some
import
beyond
the
normal
sale
of
wares.
another
example
would
be
the
sale
of
dangerous
drugs
in
which
there
is
a
record
keeping
requirement
again,
because
that
--
the
nature
of
the
business
is
such
that
it
seems
to
call
for
this
kind
of
recordkeeping.
here
the
recordkeeping
by
the
statement
of
the
congress,
and
by
the
government’s
own
admission
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
regulation
of
the
record
keeper.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
regulation
of
america’s
financial
institutions.
it
is
by
its
own
design
and
enlistment
of
those
institutions
for
the
purposes
of
monitoring
the
people
with
whom
those
institutions
deal.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
yes.
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
isn’t
my
judgment.
a
good
example
of
a
situation
in
which
it
is
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
record
keeper
or
in
this
case
the
reporting
entity
because
those
dividends
are
presumably
deductible
as
an
expense
by
the
reporting
entity
and
secondly,
in
more
--
in
this
particular
instance,
that
is
a
classic
example,
at
least
in
my
judgment
of
a
reporting
that
is
done
in
aid
of
a
specific
legislative
congressional
objective,
namely
the
collection
of
internal
revenue
and
i
don’t
think
that
this
statute
would
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
i
stand
corrected
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
second
part
of
the
argument
however
i
think
holds,
namely
that
the
reporting
in
that
instance
is
in
aid
of
a
specific
government
goal
which
is
the
collection
of
internal
revenues,
it
is
not
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
to
the
extent
that
it
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
to
the
extent
and
i
stand
corrected
to
extent
it
is
not
deductible,
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
the
special,
i
find
myself
talking
about
the
recordkeeping.
i
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
the
difficulty
with
that
is
twofold.
first
of
all,
in
the
case
in
which
congress
has
compelled
reporting
or
recordkeeping
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
a
specific
law,
congress
has
gone
through
the
process
of
deciding
whether
the
recordkeeping
in
that
case
is
justified,
warranted
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
there's
been
some
weighing
of
its
utility
in
a
particular
instance.
secondly,
this
court,
i
would
submit
would
find
it
extremely
difficult
to
test
the
reasonableness
of
this
recordkeeping
when
the
objective
is
not
against
a
particular
criminal
statute
or
not
against
a
particular
civil
law,
but
is
in
aid
of
all
government
interest,
however,
defined.
the
special
evil
it
seems
to
me
particularly
with
respect
to
the
recordkeeping
is
that
there
appear
to
be
any
number
of
alternatives
available
which
are
not
explored.
and
unlike
the
case,
for
example
the
tax
laws
or
some
of
the
other
civil
regulatory
laws
in
which
recordkeeping
or
reporting
by
the
entity
involved
appears
to
be
absolutely
essential
to
its
enforcement.
the
sheer
arrest
records
that
are
available
and
to
some
extent
are
quoted
in
our
brief
would
suggest
that
this
not
the
only
way
in
which
the
criminal
and
civil
and
regulatory
laws
of
the
united
states
can
be
enforced.
they
happen
to
be
at
least
in
their
judgment
essential
to
those
other
laws,
but
not
in
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
no,
i
object
to
the
recordkeeping
because
i
believe
--
excuse
me,
i
see
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
that
is
correct.
and
it
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
i
suggest
it’s
invalid
not
because
it’s
not
specifically
related
to
a
purpose,
but
for
the
other
reasons
that
i've
mention,
namely
that
there
is
no
way
given
the
breadth
of
the
obligation
that
this
court
can
perform
its
historic
function
and
testing
whether
that
recordkeeping
obligation
is
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
john
anderson
and
i
represent
in
these
consolidated
cases,
the
california
bankers
association.
these
consolidated
cases
entail
a
challenge
to
an
act
of
congress
passed
late
in
1970
that
has
become
to
be
known
as
the
bank
secrecy
act.
and
in
our
discussions
today,
i
think
that
initially
important
to
distinguish
as
much
as
we
can
at
all
times
between
the
two
aspects
of
that
act.
one
aspect
to
that
act
entails
and
requires
the
banks
uninsured
and
otherwise
of
this
nation
to
microfilm
and
copy
virtually
every
piece
of
paper
that
flows
through
the
domestic
banking
system
and
to
keep
that
paper
microfilmed
before
a
period
ranging
from
two
to
five
years.
the
second
part
of
the
act,
title
ii
requires
banks
to
make
reports
of
certain
kinds
of
designated
currency
transactions,
domestic
and
foreign.
with
that
background
in
mind
and
in
june
of
1972,
the
private
litigants
in
this
case
initiated
in
an
action
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
seeking
to
enjoin
enforcement
of
both
the
recordkeeping
and
the
reporting
sections
of
the
bank
secrecy
act.
with
one
judge
dissenting
a
three-judge
court
denied
motions
to
enjoin
enforcements
of
the
recordkeeping
section
of
the
act
but
granted
an
injunction
enjoining
enforcement
of
the
automatic
reporting
provisions
of
the
act.
the
government
has
appealed
from
that
portion
of
that
order
enjoining
enforcement
of
the
reporting
provisions.
the
private
litigants
have
appealed
from
that
portion
of
the
order
refusing
to
enjoin
the
so
called
recordkeeping
sections.
let
me
begin
with
a
very
brief
summary
description
of
just
what
those
record
--
excuse
me,
reporting
provisions
entail.
the
act
compels
reports
of
all
domestic
currency
transactions
found
by
the
secretary
“have
a
high
degree
of
usefulness
in
criminal,
tax
or
regulatory
investigatings
--
investigations
or
proceedings.”
the
implementing
regulations
currently
enforced
require
banks
among
others
to
report
automatically
all
$10,000.00
currency
transactions.
and
i
should
interject
here
that
when
i
say
currently
enforced
i
use
the
phrase
advisably
because
the
act
authorizes
and
the
regulations
following
through
on
that
authorize
a
change
in
that
dollar
amount
or
in
fact
the
definition
of
transaction
at
any
time
by
the
treasury
secretary.
the
transaction
report
of
the
currency
transaction
requires
disclosure
of
a
wide
variety
of
information,
including
the
name,
address
and
business
or
profession
of
the
party
involved
in
the
transaction,
the
name,
address
and
business
of
the
party
or
business
entity
for
whom
it
may
have
been
conducted
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
no.
this
is
a
currency
transaction
mr.
justice
brennan
which
is
defined
in
the
regulations
as
being
cash
or
near
cash
monetary
instruments.
it
does
not
entail
for
example
a
situation
in
which
a
person
would
go
into
a
bank
and
simply
deposit
a
check
and
not
take
out
any
currency.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
that
would
included
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
listing
the
requirements
that
must
be
reported
at
the
time
of
a
designated
transaction,
it
requires
a
description
of
the
nature
of
the
transaction
whatever
that
means
together
with
the
tight
amount
and
denomination
of
the
currency
involved
and
a
description
of
any
check
involved
in
the
transaction.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
that
is
also
correct.
let
me
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
and
it
also
requires
a
description,
as
i
say,
the
check
involved
also
a
description
of
the
id
that
is
presented
by
the
party
seeking
to
engage
in
the
transaction.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
this
presumably
means
something
like
a
driver’s
license
or
a
birth
certificate
or
some
other
form
of
identification
that
would
be
acceptable
to
the
banking
entity.
now,
there
is
an
exception
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
that
is
not
further
defined
in
the
regulations
mr.
justice.
however,
i
will
like
to
interject
in
one
time,
there
is
an
exception
to
the
reporting
requirements.
the
exception
itself
is
the
basis
for
one
of
our
challenges
to
the
constitutionality
of
this
act
and
it
reads
in
words
in
effect
to
the
following
proposition
that
“if
the
bank
in
its
judgment
decides
that
this
transaction
is
normal
and
regular
for
the
person
engaging
in
it,
i.e.
perhaps
of
a
store
which
deals
in
large
amount
of
cash
that
it
need
be
reported.
however,
we
submit
that
the
description
is
so
vague
as
to
leave
the
banks
in
a
position
of
not
knowing
when
in
fact
a
prescribed
transaction
has
occurred
and
since
in
fact
there
are
criminal
penalties,
attendant
refusal
or
failure
to
give
the
report,
it
raises
a
serious
due
process
notice
problem
in
our
mind.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan,
however
it
has
to
be
said
that
the
regulation
is
couched
in
terms
of
regular
and
normal
for
the
business
or
profession
involved,
i
suppose
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
that
is
true.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
i
don’t
know,
frankly,
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
the
--
my
the
advice
to
the
bank
in
that
particular
instance
would
be
in
view
of
fact
that
criminal
penalties
attach
failure
to
make
a
report
as
required
by
the
act
that
it
is
in
your
best
interest
to
act
cautiously
and
to
make
the
report
if
you
have
any
reason
to
believe
this
is
not
and
regular
for
this
particular
party.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
yes
i
think
we
certainly
would,
yes
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
yes.
the
banks
of
course
are
free
to
report
all
transactions.
however,
the
--
our
objection
to
the
reporting
requirement
is
not
vagueness
and
as
such.
our
objections
run
to
the
fourth
amendment
problem
which
i’ll
get
to
if
i
--
if
i
may
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
well,
it
is
simply
to
say
that
in
every
instance
that
whenever
a
$10,000.00
currency
transaction
occurs
of
which
they
are
in
the
case
of
large
commercial
banks,
presumably
many
hundred
a
day,
that
a
report
would
be
required
to
be
filed
and
i
think
my
brother
from
the
solicitor
general's
office
would
agree
that’s
not
what
the
treasury
department
wants.
it
wants
reports
of
transactions
which
in
the
judgment
of
the
bank
are
unusual
for
that
particular
depositor.
the
result
otherwise
would
be
a
simple
inundation
of
the
treasury
department
with
reports,
which
it
presumably
couldn’t
use
and
would
be
useless
to
the
extent
of
95%.
so
i
--
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
i’d
have
to
answer
in
that
fashion.
the
summary
with
respect
to
the
reporting
obligation
i
think
can
be
put
as
simply
this,
that
when
the
transaction
occurred,
the
banks
by
some
fashion
are
obligated
to
obtain
a
wide
variety
of
information,
about
that
transaction
which
in
the
absence
of
the
compulsion
under
this
act,
they
would
under
no
circumstances
need
for
their
own
banking
purposes,
this
is
an
obligation
imposed
by
the
government.
now,
turning
to
a
very
brief
summary
description
of
the
recordkeeping,
the
act
makes
a
finding
of
adequate
records,
have
a
high
degree
of
usefulness
in
the
same
words;
criminal,
tax
and
regulatory
investigations
or
proceedings.
it
makes
a
further
finding
that
microfilm
or
other
copies
of
bank
records
are
highly
useful
and
the
act
then
provides
that,
and
i
am
quoting
now
“where
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
determines
that
the
maintenance
of
appropriate
types
of
records
and
other
evidence
by
insured
banks
has
a
high
degree
of
usefulness
in
criminal,
tax
or
regulatory
investigations
or
proceedings,
he
shall
prescribe
records
--
regulations
to
carry
out
the
purposes
of
the
act.”
now,
the
regulations
and
alleged
implementation
of
foregoing
purposes
of
the
act
have
required
the
banks
of
the
united
states
to
copy
and
to
retain
as
i
have
said
for
a
period
of
--
from
two
to
five
years,
virtually
every
single
piece
of
paper
that
finds
it
way
into
the
american
domestic
banking
system
with
two
exceptions.
one
exception
has
to
do
with
payroll
checks
emanating
from
a
large
payroll.
the
catch
at
this
point
of
course
is
that
although
they're
not
recorded
at
the
issuing
point,
they
would
be
recorded
as
they
go
into
the
presumably
the
account
of
the
payee.
the
second
exception
is
for
checks
of
under
$100.00
in
amount.
the
catch
here
is,
first
that
the
bank
microfilming
equipment
as
a
matter
of
common
knowledge
and
although
we
had
no
chance
to
prove
this
in
the
--
at
the
district
court
because
this
amendment
was
made
after
this
--
the
district
court
decision,
but
the
obligation
not
to
copy
checks
under
a
hundred
dollars
is
of
little
or
no
practical
use
to
the
bank
because
the
microfilm
equipment
simply
can’t
distinguish
between
$100.00
checks
and
$1,000.00
checks.
now,
i
will
not
read
before
the
court
at
this
point,
all
of
the
documents
that
are
required
to
be
copied.
i
submit,
however,
that
a
reading
of
the
regulations,
quoted
on
pages
38
and
39,
excuse
me,
of
the
appendix
will
confirm
our
contention
that
this
act
requires
banks
to
copy
and
to
retain
for
a
period
of
two
to
five
years,
every
single
piece
of
paper
that
is
submitted
into
the
american
domestic
banking
system
in
any
formal
sense,
including
such
things
as
deposit
slips,
withdrawal
slips
and
other
advises
to
the
bank.
now
the
next
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
i’m
referring
to
pages
38
and
39
of
the
appendix
in
the
red
colored
brief
or
in
the
blue
colored
brief.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
yes.
that
is
the
section
of
the
regulations
that
are
set
forth
both
in
the
blue
colored
and
in
the
red
colored
brief.
the
purposes
of
the
act
are
not
in
dispute.
the
main
undisputed
purpose
of
the
bank
secrecy
act
was
to
aid
in
the
detection
of
what
the
government
calls,
white
collared
crimes
and
the
government
has
repeatedly
described
the
act
in
the
-
in
that
language.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
yes.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
with
respect
to
copying
of
documents,
the
bank
practices
as
alleged
in
the
district
court
uncontroverted
varies
very
wildly.
some
banks
keep
an
enormous
number
of
records
for
a
short
time.
other
banks
keep
a
small
number
of
records
for
a
long
time
and
they
are
all
numerous
in
between
positions
occupied
by
the,
bank.
the
uncontrovered
evidence
in
the
district
court
was
that
the
bank
of
america,
as
an
example
which
is
commonly
regarded
as
america’s
bank
did
not
keep
more
than
half
of
the
newly
prescribed
documents.
for
example,
did
not
keep
checks
for
a
two
years,
did
not
keep
various
other
documents
for
five
years
and
so
forth.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
mr.
justice
powell
i
think
that
was
a
question
mr.
justice
white
was
just
asking
and
the
evidence
in
the
district
court
was
that
the
practice
varied
enormously
from
bank
to
bank.
and
that
for
example
in
the
bank
of
america
to
which
you
referred
which
there
was
some
little
evidence
in
the
district
court,
the
evidence
was
that
yes,
they
did
microfilm
some
checks,
but
they
only
kept
them
for
a
period
of
from
10,
to
30
or
40
days
for
their
own
convenience
and
for
purposes
of
dispute
with
depositor
with
respect
to
payment
amounts
and
so
forth.
the
regulations
under
this
act
require
the
banks
to
film,
first
of
all,
all
the
checks
and
secondly
to
keep
them
for
a
minimum
of
tow
years.
so,
that’s
the
case
with
the
bank
of
america.
but
i
think
the
central
point
that
has
to
be
made
at
this
point
is
this,
that
absent,
these
requirements
of
recordkeeping,
the
practice
among
the
banks
of
the
united
states
varies
very
widely.
some
keep
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
no,
i’m
referring
to
the
practice
nationally,
it
is
certainly
the
case
in
california
also.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
mr.
justice
blackmun
my
information
is
that
it
is
quite
broad
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
these
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
there's
nothing
in
evidence
on
that
on
the
record,
that
is
correct.
the
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
that
is
not
--
that
is
simply
not
the
case.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
primary
reasons
for
this
legislation
given
by
the
government
at
the
time
it
was
being
proposed
was
that
banks
did
not
keep
the
records,
and
therefore,
they
found
it
difficult
when
subpoenaing
records
in
the
investigation
of
certain
alleged
crimes
to
obtain
the
records
in
question
and
it
was
--
that
was
part
of
the
purposes
or
motivation
for
this.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
no
i
--
i
may
have
misspoke
mr.
justice
blackmun.
i
believe
i
said
that
they
keep
microfilms
of
checks
for
a
short
period
of
time
ranging
from
10
to
30,
some
odd
days.
there
is
an
affidavit
in
the
appendix
describing
the
bank
of
america’s
practice
on
this
point
as
an
example
and
it
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
no.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
the
practice
as
i
understand
it,
it
is
evidenced
by
an
affidavit
and
contested
in
the
record
is
that
they
microfilm
the
check
and
the
original
is
returned
to
the
payor
in
the
normal
course
of
banking
operations.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
yes.
they
return
to
the
bank
which
is
(voice
overlap).
mr.
john
h.
anderson
yes.
that’s
correct.
that’s
right,
all
checks.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
no,
i
don’t
think.
i
think
there
is
a
substantial
difference,
legal
difference
between
a
compulsion
to
keep
checks
under
order
of
law
as
under
a
statute
and
records
or
checks
that
are
kept
in
the
ordinary
course
of
banking
business
for
the
bank's
own
purposes.
and
secondly
although
we
talk
mainly
about
checks,
i
again
respectfully
invite
the
court’s
attention
to
that
exhaustive
list
of
documents
which
are
required
to
be
kept
and
which
are
listed
on
pages
38
and
39
of
the
appendix,
neither
the
red
nor
the
blue
colored
brief.
now,
as
i
have
said
the
undisputed
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
well,
first
of
all,
that
turns
to
the
real
question
which
are
our
basic
legal
objections
to
the
recordkeeping
requirements
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
well,
i
--
watching
the
time
because
we
have
a
split
argument,
mr.
justice
brennan.
let
me
move
to
that
because
i
do
think
it
bears
some
discussion
here.
the
recordkeeping
is
in
our
judgment
unconstitutional
for
three
rather
specific
reasons.
first
of
all,
in
a
quick
summary,
an
analysis
of
those
cases
which
this
court
has
considered
dealing
with
compulsory
or
required
recordkeeping
will
show
that
they
have
been
in
aid
of
a
specific
legislative,
to
use
a
broader
word,
national
goal.
for
example,
wages
and
price
--
wage
in
our
laws,
emergency
price
regulation
or
the
tax
laws
are
classic
examples
in
which
there
is
a
specific
congressional
purpose
in
which
the
congress
has
approved
recordkeeping,
recognizing
i
would
suppose
that
the
recordkeeping
as
such
imposes
some
burden
on
the
citizenry
so
the
question
always
in
looking
at
the
statute
is,
does
this
recordkeeping
requirement
commensurate
with
the
legislative
objective.
here
the
court
will
respectfully
note
that
this
is
not
in
a
--
of
any
specific
congressional
goal
or
any
specific
congressional
policy.
it
is
in
aid
of
all
government
policy,
criminal,
civil,
tax,
regulatory,
investigative
or
a
proceeding
which
presumably
means
administrative
rulemaking.
it
is
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
i
think
it
violated
in
two
specific
instances
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
first
of
all,
it
removes
the
ability
of
this
court
to
weigh
the
recordkeeping
against
a
specific
government
need
therefore
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
well,
there
is
a
requirement
beginning
with
the
first
recordkeeping
case
of
consequent,
morton
salt
versus
the
united
states
in
which
the
court
says
that
you
could
--
can
be
required
to
keep
record
providing
that
it
is
reasonable
and
they
bear
some
reasonable
relation
to
a
legitimate
congressional
or
government
goal.
now,
i
submit
to
this
court
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
no,
that
was
a
fourth
amendment.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
i
think
mr.
justice
white,
i
am
at
it.
i
think
i
have
gone
through
to
it
by
coming
to
the
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
well,
it
is
a
fourth
amendment
objection,
that
is
correct,
but
it
refers
both
to
the
recordkeeping
and
the
reporting.
if
i
may
return
to
the
question
mr.
justice
rehnquist
raised
with
respect
to
what's
wrong
with
that
kind
of
a
recordkeeping
as
such,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
when
the
legi
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
--
the
congress
has
said
our
objective
is
all
purpose,
namely,
all
government
business,
criminal,
civil,
regulatory
and
otherwise
and
you
cannot
weigh
that
against
the
recordkeeping
objection.
there
is
no
way
that
you
can
follow
the
test
or
the
benchmark
given
in
the
morton
salt
case,
namely
that
it
has
some
reasonable
relationship
because
for
example,
if
congress
were
to
pass
a
new
criminal
statute
the
next
year,
you
wouldn’t
know
what
it
was
and
you
wouldn’t
be
able
to
equate
it
against
the
recordkeeping
obligation
which
is
imposed
today.
now
the
second
thing
which
i
believe
to
be
more
serious
is
the
--
that
analysis
of
the
recordkeeping
cases
approved
by
this
court
would
show
that
they
serve
one
of
two
purposes
either
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
record
keeper.
a
classic
example
would
be
a
requirement
that
employers’
report
wages
and
hours
pay
so
that
the
waging
(voice
overlap)
laws
could
be
enforced
or
child
labor
laws
could
be
enforced.
price
control
is
another
example
in
which
the
vendor
is
required
to
indicate
which
charge
--
prices
he
is
charging
for
his
items,
these
are
essential
to
regulate
the
record
keeper.
the
second
category
which
this
court
has
considered
have
been
though
--
that
kind
of
recordkeeping
required
to
regulate
a
particular
business.
two
examples;
firearms
dealers
in
which
there
is
a
requirement
that
records
to
be
kept
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
that
particular
business
which
is
deemed
by
the
congress
to
be
dangerous
or
to
have
some
import
beyond
the
normal
sale
of
wares.
another
example
would
be
the
sale
of
dangerous
drugs
in
which
there
is
a
record
keeping
requirement
again,
because
that
--
the
nature
of
the
business
is
such
that
it
seems
to
call
for
this
kind
of
recordkeeping.
here
the
recordkeeping
by
the
statement
of
the
congress,
and
by
the
government’s
own
admission
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
regulation
of
the
record
keeper.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
regulation
of
america’s
financial
institutions.
it
is
by
its
own
design
and
enlistment
of
those
institutions
for
the
purposes
of
monitoring
the
people
with
whom
those
institutions
deal.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
yes.
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
isn’t
my
judgment.
a
good
example
of
a
situation
in
which
it
is
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
regulating
the
record
keeper
or
in
this
case
the
reporting
entity
because
those
dividends
are
presumably
deductible
as
an
expense
by
the
reporting
entity
and
secondly,
in
more
--
in
this
particular
instance,
that
is
a
classic
example,
at
least
in
my
judgment
of
a
reporting
that
is
done
in
aid
of
a
specific
legislative
congressional
objective,
namely
the
collection
of
internal
revenue
and
i
don’t
think
that
this
statute
would
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
i
stand
corrected
mr.
justice
stewart.
the
second
part
of
the
argument
however
i
think
holds,
namely
that
the
reporting
in
that
instance
is
in
aid
of
a
specific
government
goal
which
is
the
collection
of
internal
revenues,
it
is
not
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
to
the
extent
that
it
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
to
the
extent
and
i
stand
corrected
to
extent
it
is
not
deductible,
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
the
special,
i
find
myself
talking
about
the
recordkeeping.
i
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
well,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
the
difficulty
with
that
is
twofold.
first
of
all,
in
the
case
in
which
congress
has
compelled
reporting
or
recordkeeping
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
a
specific
law,
congress
has
gone
through
the
process
of
deciding
whether
the
recordkeeping
in
that
case
is
justified,
warranted
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
there's
been
some
weighing
of
its
utility
in
a
particular
instance.
secondly,
this
court,
i
would
submit
would
find
it
extremely
difficult
to
test
the
reasonableness
of
this
recordkeeping
when
the
objective
is
not
against
a
particular
criminal
statute
or
not
against
a
particular
civil
law,
but
is
in
aid
of
all
government
interest,
however,
defined.
the
special
evil
it
seems
to
me
particularly
with
respect
to
the
recordkeeping
is
that
there
appear
to
be
any
number
of
alternatives
available
which
are
not
explored.
and
unlike
the
case,
for
example
the
tax
laws
or
some
of
the
other
civil
regulatory
laws
in
which
recordkeeping
or
reporting
by
the
entity
involved
appears
to
be
absolutely
essential
to
its
enforcement.
the
sheer
arrest
records
that
are
available
and
to
some
extent
are
quoted
in
our
brief
would
suggest
that
this
not
the
only
way
in
which
the
criminal
and
civil
and
regulatory
laws
of
the
united
states
can
be
enforced.
they
happen
to
be
at
least
in
their
judgment
essential
to
those
other
laws,
but
not
in
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
no,
i
object
to
the
recordkeeping
because
i
believe
--
excuse
me,
i
see
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
that
is
correct.
and
it
--
mr.
john
h.
anderson
i
suggest
it’s
invalid
not
because
it’s
not
specifically
related
to
a
purpose,
but
for
the
other
reasons
that
i've
mention,
namely
that
there
is
no
way
given
the
breadth
of
the
obligation
that
this
court
can
perform
its
historic
function
and
testing
whether
that
recordkeeping
obligation
is
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
john
h.
anderson
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
