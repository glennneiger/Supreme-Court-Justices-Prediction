ordinarily,
what
form
would
the
transaction
take
this
cash
and
a
check?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
no.
i
mean
does
he
--
suppose
he
cashes
the
check
for
$15,000.00.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
if
i
came
in
and
while
i
cashed
a
check
for
$15,000.00
before
--
it
was
cashed,
the
teller,
whoever
it
was
would
have
to
get
all
this
information
from
me,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
then
he’d
also
have
to
note
down
how
many
$50.00
bills
or
how
many
$100.00
and
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
else?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
that’s
mean?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
description
of
the
check
would
be
--
i
expect
on
what
bank
it
was
drawn
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
suppose,
on
the
face
of
it
that
would
mean,
if
i
came
in
twice
a
week
with
checks
for
$15,000.00
to
be
cashed,
a
time
might
come
when
the
bank
would
sink
--
was
no
reason
any
longer
to
take
that
information
from
me
because
it’s
a
regular,
even
though
i
might
be
kingpin
of
the
robbery
racket?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
you,
assuming
its
all
as
onerous
as
you
suggest
to
require
the
banks
to
do
this,
what
is
the
bearing
of
that
on
the
issue
we
have
to
decide?'
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
not
--
i
don’t
get
to
it
if
you're
not
ready
to
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
anderson
the
colloquy
between
you
and
mr.
justice
stewart,
does
this
imply
that
insofar
as
these
recordkeeping
requirements
are
in
aid
of
the
internal
revenue
laws,
you
don’t
object
to
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
i
know,
it
extends
to
more
just
a
tax
but
it
also
--
among
those
things
that
you
cited
was
taxed.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
do
suggest
that
even
to
that
extent,
this
requirement
is
involved?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
maybe
irrelevant
but
do
the
banks
get
any
compensation
for
the
service
from
some
federal
agency
that
they
involve
considering
time
and
personnel
and
everything
else
(voice

--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i've
been
thinking
off
--
it
must
--
the
rolls
stored
in
warehouses,
taking
them
out,
locating
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
providing
copies,
this
must
involve
expense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
more
expense
in
that
involved,
is
it?
that
merely
the
microfilm
is
a
histo
--
expensive
storing
for
this
length
of
time
and
the
expense
of
locating
what
some
government
agency
may
want
the
bank
to
show
up
or
expect
making
copies
of
whether
it
is
the
government
they
want.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
was

is

in
the

going?
i
am
looking
at
page
15
of
your

justice
william
j.

say?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
get
the
amount
in

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
i
gather
(inaudible)
on
the
currency
transaction
with
the
court.
if
you
had
then
the
$15,000.00,
$10,000.00
in
denominations
of
a
hundred
and
five,
hundred
and
the
thousand
dollar.
you
just
put
the
number,
the
total.
how
many
hundred,
how
many
500,
how
many
1,000,
but
i
suppose
--
justice
william
j.

but
it
don’t
seem
it
