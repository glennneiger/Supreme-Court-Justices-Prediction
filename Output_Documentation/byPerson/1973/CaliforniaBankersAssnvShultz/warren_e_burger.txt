we'll

arguments

mr.
anderson
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn’t
it
more
likely
to
be
that
if
they
knew
that
particular
person
ran
a
machine
shop
with
the
payroll
of
about
$15,000.00
a
week
that
they
could
then
conclude
that
this
was
normal
for
payroll
purposes
and
not
make
a
report.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
let's
assume,
that
on
the
other
hand,
he
was
widely
reputed
to
be
a
member
of
someone
of
this
organized
crime
groups,
do
you
think
the
bank
could
safely
make
that
decision
in
that
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
would
you
advice
them
if
they
asked
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you
weigh
in
the
equation,
the
facts
that
i
have
mentioned
hypothetically
that
the
man
was
engaged
widely
--
appear
to
be
engaged
in
on
lawful
activity
and
unlike
the
other
gentle
man,
did
not
have
a
machine
shop
with
a
$15,000.00
payroll
every
week.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
objection
seems
to
go
to
the
fact
that
the
statute
has
many
objectives
and
targets
instead
of
just
one,
and
perhaps
your
colleague
will
enlarge
on
that
a
little
bit
if
he’s
covering
some
of
those
points.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
marson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh!
isn’t
the
--
doesn’t
the
dividend
reporting
aid,
is
that
an
aid
of
criminal
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
as
a
man
the
receives
a
lot
of
dividends
and
never
reports
them
deliberately.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let's
say
for
the
purpose
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
pretty
(voice
overlap)
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
aren’t
you
think
the
social
security
reporting
requirements
have
more
than
one
purpose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
it
might
also
tend
to
produce
some
evidence
of
criminality
on
the
part
of
the
person
who
was
going
into
a
bank
and
buying
$20,000.00
worth
of
drafts
on
a
swiss
--
payable
on
a
swiss
bank
every
week,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
marson.
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
the
bank
have
any
fifth
amendment
privilege,
mr.
wallace?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
the
government
is
acting
or
the
private
bank
or
company
is
acting
as
a
government
agent
when
they
withhold
taxes,
social
security
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
wallace,
what
about
the
corollary
if
that
if
--
if
i
walk
into
the
bank
every
week
with
$15,000.00
in
large
bills
to
buy
a
draft
on
a
swiss
bank
to
transfer
the
money
to
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
the
same?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
bank
might
send
out
a
notice
with
its
mention,
a
monthly
canceled
checks.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
marson.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
marson,
(voice

more
terrifying
20
or
30
years
ago,
but
after
the
advent
of
social
security,
medicare,
to
say
nothing
of
enlargement
of
the
reach
of
tax
laws,
those
numbers
when
you
add
them
up
would
produce
numbers
very
much
like
the
ones
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
often
used
for
that
purpose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
you
carry
a
gift
from
london
for
the
accommodation
of
a
friend
in
london
to
some
young
lady
who
is
getting
married
in
new
york,
you
must
report
that
on
the
customs
declaration.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
you
do
it
for
the
accommodation
of
someone
else
that
carrying
it
for
the
accommodation
of
another
person?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
federal
reserves
act?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
for
the
purposes
of
the
commerce
clause
conceivably,
the
government
want
--
might
want
to
find
out
whether
the
telephone
company
is
reporting
accurately
all
their
long
distance
calls
but
by
merely
measuring
them
and
under
the
commerce
clause
that
would
not
be
a
--
probably
would
not
--
the
objection
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
as
justice
rehnquist
suggested
then
you
get
into
the
taking
the
commerce,
the
content
of
the
communication
down
then
something
other
than
the
commerce
clause
comes
into
play.
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
