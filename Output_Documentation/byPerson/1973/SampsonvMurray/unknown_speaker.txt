unknown

mr.
jones
if
the
government
loses
this
case;
could
the
regulation
in
question
be
revoked
without
any
constitutional
overturns?
unknown
speaker
just
to
tie
again
is
the
respondent
still
working
on
gsa?
unknown
speaker
as
the
act
expressly
forbid
the
civil
service
commission
from
keeping
a
person
under
a
job
pending
appeal?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
irreparable
injury
standard
is
at
least
that
that
would
be
applicable.
i
know
you
believe
that
the
court
hasn't
any
authority
at
all
--
unknown
speaker
but
mr
jones,
i
thought
the
basic
issue
before
judge
gasch,
was
the
contention
that
in
doing
what
they
did,
the
agency
had
not
followed
its
own
regulations,
because
–
in
other
words
if
i
understood
it,
the
dismissal
had
to
depend
upon
her,
how
she
had
acquitted
herself
in
gsa
service
and
not
as
whoever
the
general
investigator
was
--
on
the
basis
of
how
she
had
acquitted
herself
in
previous
employment
and
judge
gasch
said,
“well,
if
the
agency
followed
its
own
regulations,
then
of
course,
this
case
should
be
dismissed.
bring
in
the
man
who
terminated
her
and
find
out”.
the
government
said,
“no,
he
is
out
of
town,
we
can't
bring
him”.
judge
gasch
said,
“well
let's
wait
a
few
days”.
then
the
government
comes
back
and
says
we
are
not
going
to
bring
him
and
that's
when
he
issued
the
interim
restraint,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
no
it
is,
but
am
i
right
as
to
the
facts
are
concerned?
unknown
speaker
according
to
himself,
it
was
determined
that
he
was
just
going
to
try
to
see
if
--
to
determine
whatever
---
unknown
speaker
and
apply
normal
equitable
principle.
unknown
speaker
that
is
prior
employment.
however
she
may
have
acquitted
that,
was
irrelevant?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
issue
you
will
present
--
unknown
speaker
let's
just
assume
that
there
is
a
very
good
chance
for
winning
the
court
of
civil
service
commission,
the
issue
still
remains
whether
the
court
had
any
power
to
--
unknown
speaker
--
or
whether
even
normal
equitable
principles
would
have
permitted
it.
unknown
speaker
but
may
i
ask,
you
would
conceive
if
the
congress
had
foreclosed
this,
as
we
thought
in
arrow,
congress
had
done.
if
congress
had
foreclosed
it
and
that
was
the
scheme
of
the
act,
then
there
was
no
power.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
only
when
the
congress,
i
gather
your
position
is
that
it
in
fact
forecloses
it,
that
the
ordinary
equitable
power
and
irreperable
injury
is
denied--
unknown
speaker
congress
did
intend
the
civil
service
commission
to
have
but
you
are
saying
that
they
intended
the
courts
to
have.
i
think
the
inference
from
congressional
silence
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
effect
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
one
way
or
the
other.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
unless
congress
either
expressively
or
by
implication
has
foreclosed
exercise
of
equitable
powers
by
the
court,
then
those
powers
are
there
and
it
become
only
a
question
of
the
abusive
discretion
in
their
exercise.
unknown
speaker
because
we
didn't
have
that
in
arrow
because
we
had
a
whole
statutory
history
which
made
it
clear
that
the
icc
can
act
or
have
got
the
certain
number
of
months
and
our
conclusion
was
that
they
couldn't
act
after
that
and
congress
meant
then
neither
court
nor
icc
--
unknown
speaker
in
that
agency?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
by
regulation,
and
not
by
stand
--
unknown
speaker
this
is
not
a
hearing
question
unknown
speaker
whether
or
not
they
comply
with
the
regulation
which
said
that
they
must
limit
termination,
so
reasons
effected
--
affects
to
her
service
with
this
agency.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
case
from
this
court
holding
that
the
discharge
of
a
federal
employee
and
the
probation
employee
is
reviewable
by
mandamus
after
agency
action
is
completed?
unknown
speaker
that
wasn't
a
probationary
employee.
unknown
speaker
that
says
reviewing
court,
does
that?
unknown
speaker
this
is
in
advance
of
any
application
to
review
anything,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
doesn't
that
really
refer
to
the
reviewing
court
reviewing
the
orders
of
the
civil
service
commission?
unknown
speaker
this
being
you
think
to
protect
the
jurisdiction
or
review
the
agency
to
finalize
its
action--
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
the
district
court
just
added
an
injunction
pending
its
determination
of
what
it
thought
the
other
issues
were,
the
chances
of
success
in
the
irreparable
injury.
unknown
speaker
was
that
correctly,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
did
the
court
had
any
power
at
all
to
enter
an
injunction
given
good
chances
of
success
and
given
irreparable
injury,
do
you
think
they
had
power
to
temporarily
to
enjoin
pending
those
determinations?
unknown
speaker
so
that
this
case
really
turns
then,
it
has
to
turn
on
the
power.
unknown
speaker
mr.
