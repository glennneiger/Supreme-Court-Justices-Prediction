the
case
of
sampson
against
murray
kind
of
came
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
respondent
sampson
was
a
probationary
government
employee
in
the
public
building
services
of
gsa.
she
was
notified
by
her
supervisor
that
she
would
be
discharged
from
employment
at
a
specified
future
date.
pending
her
administrative
appeal
for
the
civil
service
commission,
she
sought
a
temporary
restraining
order
in
united
states
district
court,
claiming
that
she
had
been
dismissed
for
reasons
pertaining
to
her
previous
employment
and
that
she
had
not
received
the
procedural
protection
required
by
the
civil
service
regulations
for
dismissals
of
that
type.
the
district
judge
issued
a
temporary
restraining
order
and
set
a
hearing
on
the
motion
for
preliminary
injunction
for
the
following
week.
at
that
time
the
government
refused
to
produce
a
witness
and
offered
his
testimony
by
affidavit.
the
district
court
said
that
he
wished
to
hear
the
witness
in
person
and
rejected
the
government's
offer
to
proceed
by
affidavit.
when
the
government
indicated
they
would
not
produce
the
supervisor,
the
district
court
announced
that
the
temporary
restraining
order
would
be
indefinitely
continued.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
affirmed
the
district
court,
holding
that
the
lower
court
could
properly
issue
such
an
injunctive
order
to
preserve
the
status
quo,
pending
respondent's
pursuit
of
administrative
remedy.
while
we
don't
believe
that
the
district
court
is
without
jurisdiction
to
issue
temporary
injunctions
in
government
personnel
cases,
we
think
that
several
factors
militated
against
the
granting
of
relief
in
a
case
such
as
this
and
that
temporary
relief
should
be
reserved
for
truly
extraordinary
cases.
we
hold
the
federal
courts
in
general
and
this
court
in
particular
has
had
a
traditional
reluctance
to
intervene
in
government
personnel
disputes,
involving
as
they
do,
the
often
delicate
relationship
of
employer
and
employee
and
the
important
considerations
of
government
efficiency.
this
reluctance
has
increased
in
the
case
when
the
employee
is
a
probationary
employee,
a
class
of
employee
to
whom
congress
has
extended
fewer
substantive
and
procedural
rights
than
to
permanent
employees.
when
the
discharge
of
such
employees
is
at
issue
we
believe
the
district
court
should
play
a
very
restricted
role
leaving
the
matter
to
the
civil
service
commission
in
all
but
the
most
exceptional
circumstances
until
that
commission
has
had
an
opportunity
to
review
the
validity
of
a
discharge
and
to
contemplate
the
proper
relief
if
needed.
we
accordingly
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
