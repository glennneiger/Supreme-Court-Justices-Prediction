mr.
thomas
mcgrew
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
i
please
the
court.
i
would
like
if
i
may
to
begin
by
adding
slightly
to
counsel
statement
facts.
the
regulation
under
which
mrs.
muray
complained
to
the
civil
service
commission,
protected
her
against
the
use
of
prior
employment
“
in
whole
or
in
part”.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
exactly.
she
was
exposed
in
a
three
page
memorandum
which
went
to
the
boss
of
this
agency,
to
a
page
and
a
half
of
her
alleged
conduct
to
the
defense
intelligence
agency
and
it
was
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
that
this
regulation
was
intended
to
avoid.
it
was
what
your
honors
will
read
it,
but
it
the
sort
of
thing
where
it
says,
“true,
her
record
is
excellent,
true
she
got
all
these
outstanding
ratings”,
but
the
people
who
really
knew,
the
people
who
didn't
write
her
say
this
or
that.
that's
what
they
would
not
---
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
that
is
the
issue
we
presented
to
the
civil
service
commission.
the
government
conceded
before
judge
gasch,
that
the
author
of
that
memorandum
violated
the
regulation
to
the
extent
that
he
considered
prior
conduct.
the
question
was
whether
the
person
who
signed
the
attached
letter
and
memorandum
said,
if
you
agree
with
this,
sign
the
attached
letter
and
there
is
only
one
letter
there.--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
well,
at
that
point
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
quite
right,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
two
sources
of
power.
one
is,
the
all
writs
act
under
cases
like
these,
and
the
other
is
11
(d)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
i
think
that
is
exactly
right--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
in
fact
arrow,
and
dean,
and
this
case,
i
think
afford
a
very
instructive
example
of
how
one
deals
with
this
legislation.
in
arrow,
the
congress
had
given
the
icc
the
power
to
suspend
rights.
this
court
held
and
i
certainly
belong
and
i
think
it's
clearly
right
that
that
ousted
the
courts.
in
dean,
we
had
a
situation
where
the
clayton
act
gave
the
department
of
justice
the
power
to
do
interim
relief
and
was
silent
on
the
questions
of
federal
trade
commission.
there
the
result
was
that
the
federal
trade
commission
could
go
in.
this
case,
i
think
is
still
the
easier
case.
this
statute
is
completely
silent.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
oh
no,
no
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
i
guess
i
am
not
being
clear
mr.
justice
white.
what
i
meant
to
say
is
that
in
arrow,
we
had
a
situation
where
the
statute
expressly
gave
the
icc
the
authority
to
suspend.
by
so
doing
it
was
held
that
this
ousted
the
courts.
the
civil
service
commission
has
no
such
authority.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
thats
right,
well
it
seems
to
me
the
assumption
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
exactly
right.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
i
thank
in
context
mr.
chief
justice
that
it
is
clear
that
senator
langer
is
not
saying
that,
senator
langer
is
stating
his
understanding
of
what
would
happen
and
what
i
submit
would
happen
in
999
out
of
a
1000
cases.
i
don't
think
he
intended
that
and
i
don't
think
that
it
can
be
fairly
taken
in
context
as
a
statement
on
the
power
of
the
federal
courts,
either
directly
or
by
inference
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
no,
no
if
i
may
say
so
your
honor,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
here
is
whether
there
shall
be
a
per
se
rule
saying
under
no
circumstances,
can
this
be
done,
or
whether
the
traditional
prerequisites
of
equity
jurisdiction
will
be
applied.
for
example,
your
honor
raised
the
situation
of
air
traffic
controllers
or
cafeteria
workers,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
a
situation
that
comes
clearly
under
one
of
the
criteria
for
equitable
jurisdiction,
namely,
what
is
the
injury
to
the
government.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
i
would
suggest
your
honor
that
dean
foods
seems
very
much
to
suggest
that.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
here
your
honor,
has
a
whole
statutory
history
which
says
that
the
sole
purpose
of
the
back
pay
act
was
not
to
restrict
any
existing
remedies,
not
to
change
any
existing
remedies,
but
to
create
one
new
one.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
it
gives
you
honor,
correctly,
it
does
give
an
absolute
right
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
it
is,
but
there
are
restrictions,
race,
color,
creed,
sex,
politics
and
prior
conduct.
the
one
right
a
probationer
has
in
sum
is
to
be
judged
on
the
basis
of
his
own
conduct
during
the
probationary
period
and
not
extraneously.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
in
that
agency.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
that
is
by
regulation.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
the
right,
if
your
honor
please,
by
the
power
in
the
district
court,
is
to
enjoin
subject,
of
course,
to
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits
subject
to
finding
of
irreparable
injury,
subject
to
all
the
conditions
of
equitable
jurisdiction,
to
enjoin
an
agency
action
pending
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
before
an
agency,
whatever
the
agency
may
be,
and
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
the
case
for
that
in
terms
of
the
relevant
reviewing
court
and
this
court's
is
dean
foods,
i
should
say.
there
the
court
of
appeals
was
the
relevant
reviewing
court
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
the
trade
commission
asked
for
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
no
your
honor.
the
district
court
is
the
reviewing
court
for
discharge.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
my
jurisdiction
in
terms
of
the
right
of
the
district
court
to
review
the
civil
service
commission
is
28
u.s.c
1361,
the
mandamus
act.
in
terms
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
yes
your
honor.
in
fact,
as
white
v.
berry
held--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
it
does
you
honor,
and
i
think
we
clearly
showed
one.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
the
clear
legal
duty
is
not
to
terminate
a
probationary
employee
on
the
basis
in
whole
or
in
part,
of
conduct
which
occurred
prior
to
the
time
that
person
was
---
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
that
your
honor,
is
in
the
court
of
federal
regulations.
i
can
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
no,
this
is
the
issue
we
are
taking
before--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
exactly
right.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
your
honor,will
find
that
white
v.
berry
said
exactly
that
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
that
was
not
a
probationary
employee.
even
in
any
case,
holding
a
probationary
employee's
discharge
is
reviewable
even
after
the
discharge
process--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
in
this
case,
i
am
not
--
in
this
court,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
such
case.
it
seems
to
me
if
i
may
mention
of
the
second
source
of
jurisdiction
in
this
respect,
is
10
(d)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
this
states
on
such
conditions
as
maybe
required
into
the
extent
necessary
to
prevent
irreparable
injury,
the
reviewing
court
may
issue
all
necessary
and
appropriate
process
to
postpone
the
effective
date
of
an
agency
action.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
and
the
district
court
is
to
the
reviewing
court.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
it
is
in
advance
of
an
application.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
i
think,
though
it
is.
it
does
refer
to
the
reviewing
court,
for
reviewing
the
order
of
the
civil
service
commission.
the
question
is
can
they
stay
the
agency
action?
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
i
think,
if
your
honor,
please
that
that
goes
directly
to
the
question
of
irreparable
injury.
it
seems
to
me
that
loss
of
employment
can
impact
very
seriously
on
the
possibility
of
continuing
appeal
through
the
civil
service
process.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
the
way
i
went
your
honor
was
exactly
this.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
yes,
thats
right,
the
hearing
was
consulted
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
exactly.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
thats
right,
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
that
is
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
in
that
situation,
if
your
honor
please,
the
administrative
procedure
act
would
clearly
apply.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
i
can
give
you,
if
your
honor
please,
several
cases
exactly
like
this
one
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
drew
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
was
just
decided
which
held
that
a
private
employee's
discharge
may
be
enjoined
pending
completion
of
the
eeoc
remedies.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
the
court
did
not
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
the
court
did
not
explain
its
reasons.
it
simply
entered
the
the
order
in
that
case.
it
did
not
say
that
this
particular
remedy
will
--.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
i
do
not
have
such
a
case.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
that
was
not,
right.
reeber
v.
rossell
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
was.
that
was
judge
kaufman's
case
in
the
early
50s
and
in
the
early
60s,
there
was
schwartz
v.
covington
which
involved
the
military
discharge
review
board
and
again
the
state
pending
that--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
again
not,
quite
right
your
honor.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
extreme
uniqueness
of
this
case
is
pointed
out
in
the
series
of
briefs
the
government
has
filed
in
the
docket
here.
from
one
court
to
the
next,
the
argument
of
the
flood
of
litigation
has
been
made.
in
a
petition
for
cert
and
for
this
court,
the
government
stated
the
potential
volume
of
new
litigation
as
indicated
by
the
fact
that
according
to
the
commission
figures
some
16000
individual
adverse
actions
and
some
22000
reductions
in
force
were
taken
against
federal
employees
in
fiscal
1971.
we
have
now
had
almost
two
years
experience
with
this
case
in
district
of
columbia.
the
number
of
employees
who
have
succeeded
under
the
standard
set
forth
by
judge
welby
(ph)
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
not
in
the
thousands
and
it
is
not
in
the
hundreds
and
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
find
out
it
is
not
even
one.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
very
nearly.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
the
district
court
is
still
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
money,
back
pay
is
not
always.
i
think
in
most
cases
will
be
--
and
in
almost
every
imaginable
case,
it
will
be
an
adequate
remedy,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
situations,
one
can
think
of
a
situation
where
a
person
could
not
continue
to
prosecute
their
appeal
before
the
civil
service
commission,
one
can
think
of
a
situation
where
the
lack
of
money
would
impact
very
severely
on
the
health
of
one's
dependents
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
that's
right.
and
what
we
have
asked
for
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
we
were
entitled
to,
is
to
a
continuation
of
this
hearing
so
that
we
can
attempt
to
prove
that.
judge
welby(ph)
writing
for
the
court
of
appeal
did
not
say
we
would
win.
he
said
we
might
well
lose
but
that
that
question
had
still
to
be
made
on
this
record
and
was
for
judge
gasch
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
very
probably
would
not
--
very
probably
would
not.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
it
did
not
your
honor,
that
point
was
submitted
in
argument
before
the
court
on
the
temporary
restraining
order.
the
record
there
is
not
before
this
court,
it
was
not
taken
out
by
the
government
that
the
court
of
appeals.
so,
i
hesitate
to
quote
from
it.i
can
represent
to
the
court
what
happened
if
you
like
to
know.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
a
decision
was
made
on
a
legal
issue
and
it
was
given
to
the
court
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
temporary
restraining
order.
if
there
are
no
more
question,
i
will
stop.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
i
please
the
court.
i
would
like
if
i
may

“

that
comes
clearly
under
one
of
the
criteria
for
equitable
jurisdiction,
namely,
what
is
the
injury
to
the
government.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
i
would
suggest
your
honor
that
dean
foods
seems
very
much
to
suggest
that.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
here
your
honor,
has
a
whole
statutory
history
which
says
that
the
sole
purpose
of
the
back
pay
act
was
not
to
restrict
any
existing
remedies,
not
to
change
any
existing
remedies,
but
to
create
one
new
one.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
it
gives
you
honor,
correctly,
it
does
give
an
absolute
right
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
it
is,
but
there
are
restrictions,
race,
color,
creed,
sex,
politics
and
prior
conduct.
the
one
right
a
probationer
has
in
sum
is
to
be
judged
on
the
basis
of
his
own
conduct
during
the
probationary
period
and
not
extraneously.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
in
that
agency.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
that
is
by
regulation.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
the
right,
if
your
honor
please,
by
the
power
in
the
district
court,
is
to
enjoin
subject,
of
course,
to
likelihood
of
success
on
the
merits
subject
to
finding
of
irreparable
injury,
subject
to
all
the
conditions
of
equitable
jurisdiction,
to
enjoin
an
agency
action
pending
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies
before
an
agency,
whatever
the
agency
may
be,
and
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
the
case
for
that
in
terms
of
the
relevant
reviewing
court
and
this
court's
is
dean
foods,
i
should
say.
there
the
court
of
appeals
was
the
relevant
reviewing
court
of
the
federal
trade
commission.
the
trade
commission
asked
for
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
no
your
honor.
the
district
court
is
the
reviewing
court
for
discharge.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
my
jurisdiction
in
terms
of
the
right
of
the
district
court
to
review
the
civil
service
commission
is
28
u.s.c
1361,
the
mandamus
act.
in
terms
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
yes
your
honor.
in
fact,
as
white
v.
berry
held--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
it
does
you
honor,
and
i
think
we
clearly
showed
one.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
the
clear
legal
duty
is
not
to
terminate
a
probationary
employee
on
the
basis
in
whole
or
in
part,
of
conduct
which
occurred
prior
to
the
time
that
person
was
---
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
that
your
honor,
is
in
the
court
of
federal
regulations.
i
can
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
no,
this
is
the
issue
we
are
taking
before--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
exactly
right.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
your
honor,will
find
that
white
v.
berry
said
exactly
that
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
that
was
not
a
probationary
employee.
even
in
any
case,
holding
a
probationary
employee's
discharge
is
reviewable
even
after
the
discharge
process--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
in
this
case,
i
am
not
--
in
this
court,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
such
case.
it
seems
to
me
if
i
may
mention
of
the
second
source
of
jurisdiction
in
this
respect,
is
10
(d)
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
this
states
on
such
conditions
as
maybe
required
into
the
extent
necessary
to
prevent
irreparable
injury,
the
reviewing
court
may
issue
all
necessary
and
appropriate
process
to
postpone
the
effective
date
of
an
agency
action.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
and
the
district
court
is
to
the
reviewing
court.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
it
is
in
advance
of
an
application.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
i
think,
though
it
is.
it
does
refer
to
the
reviewing
court,
for
reviewing
the
order
of
the
civil
service
commission.
the
question
is
can
they
stay
the
agency
action?
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
i
think,
if
your
honor,
please
that
that
goes
directly
to
the
question
of
irreparable
injury.
it
seems
to
me
that
loss
of
employment
can
impact
very
seriously
on
the
possibility
of
continuing
appeal
through
the
civil
service
process.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
the
way
i
went
your
honor
was
exactly
this.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
yes,
thats
right,
the
hearing
was
consulted
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
exactly.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
thats
right,
there
is
nothing
else
in
the
record.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
that
is
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
in
that
situation,
if
your
honor
please,
the
administrative
procedure
act
would
clearly
apply.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
i
can
give
you,
if
your
honor
please,
several
cases
exactly
like
this
one
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
drew
in
the
fifth
circuit
which
was
just
decided
which
held
that
a
private
employee's
discharge
may
be
enjoined
pending
completion
of
the
eeoc
remedies.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
the
court
did
not
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
the
court
did
not
explain
its
reasons.
it
simply
entered
the
the
order
in
that
case.
it
did
not
say
that
this
particular
remedy
will
--.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
i
do
not
have
such
a
case.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
that
was
not,
right.
reeber
v.
rossell
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
was.
that
was
judge
kaufman's
case
in
the
early
50s
and
in
the
early
60s,
there
was
schwartz
v.
covington
which
involved
the
military
discharge
review
board
and
again
the
state
pending
that--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
again
not,
quite
right
your
honor.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
extreme
uniqueness
of
this
case
is
pointed
out
in
the
series
of
briefs
the
government
has
filed
in
the
docket
here.
from
one
court
to
the
next,
the
argument
of
the
flood
of
litigation
has
been
made.
in
a
petition
for
cert
and
for
this
court,
the
government
stated
the
potential
volume
of
new
litigation
as
indicated
by
the
fact
that
according
to
the
commission
figures
some
16000
individual
adverse
actions
and
some
22000
reductions
in
force
were
taken
against
federal
employees
in
fiscal
1971.
we
have
now
had
almost
two
years
experience
with
this
case
in
district
of
columbia.
the
number
of
employees
who
have
succeeded
under
the
standard
set
forth
by
judge
welby
(ph)
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
not
in
the
thousands
and
it
is
not
in
the
hundreds
and
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
find
out
it
is
not
even
one.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
very
nearly.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
the
district
court
is
still
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
that
is
exactly
right.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
it
seems
to
me
your
honor
that
money,
back
pay
is
not
always.
i
think
in
most
cases
will
be
--
and
in
almost
every
imaginable
case,
it
will
be
an
adequate
remedy,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
situations,
one
can
think
of
a
situation
where
a
person
could
not
continue
to
prosecute
their
appeal
before
the
civil
service
commission,
one
can
think
of
a
situation
where
the
lack
of
money
would
impact
very
severely
on
the
health
of
one's
dependents
--
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
that's
right.
and
what
we
have
asked
for
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
we
were
entitled
to,
is
to
a
continuation
of
this
hearing
so
that
we
can
attempt
to
prove
that.
judge
welby(ph)
writing
for
the
court
of
appeal
did
not
say
we
would
win.
he
said
we
might
well
lose
but
that
that
question
had
still
to
be
made
on
this
record
and
was
for
judge
gasch
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
very
probably
would
not
--
very
probably
would
not.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
it
did
not
your
honor,
that
point
was
submitted
in
argument
before
the
court
on
the
temporary
restraining
order.
the
record
there
is
not
before
this
court,
it
was
not
taken
out
by
the
government
that
the
court
of
appeals.
so,
i
hesitate
to
quote
from
it.i
can
represent
to
the
court
what
happened
if
you
like
to
know.
mr.
thomas
mcgrew
a
decision
was
made
on
a
legal
issue
and
it
was
given
to
the
court
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
temporary
restraining
order.
if
there
are
no
more
question,
i
will
stop.
