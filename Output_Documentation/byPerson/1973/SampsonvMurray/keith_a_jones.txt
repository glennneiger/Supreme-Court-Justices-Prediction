mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court?
the
issue
here
was
whether
in
a
case
involving
a
routine
termination
action
against
the
federal
probationary
employee.
federal
district
court
may
enjoin
the
termination
pending
that
employee's
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission.
the
facts
are
as
follows.
in
january
1971,
respondent
was
hired
as
a
program
analyst
in
the
general
services
administration
and
a
salary
of
about
$18,000
a
year.
four
months
later,
one
of
her
immediate
supervisors
sent
to
his
supervisor,
mr.
sanders,
a
memorandum
recommending
that
her
employment
be
terminated.
his
recommendation
set
forth
a
variety
of
reasons
why
her
work
performance
was
considered
to
be
unsatisfactory
and
that
among
these
were
her
failure
to
follow
the
instructions
of
her
supervisor,
follow
office
direction
generally
and
her
inability
to
get
along
with
her
fellow
employees.
the
memorandum
went
on
however
to
state
that
she
had
experienced
difficulties
with
her
previous
employer,
the
defense
intelligence
agency.
after
studying
this
recommendation
mr.
sanders
issued
to
the
respondent
a
notice
terminating
her
employment
effective
to
next
week,
the
termination
notice
stated
expressly
that
the
reasons
for
her
termination
or
for
failure
to
abide
by
office
of
procedure
and
to
accept
the
direction
of
her
supervisors.
on
receiving
this
termination
notice
the
respondent
filed
an
appeal
with
the
civil
service
commission
and
lodged
a
complaint
in
the
united
states
district
court
to
the
district
of
columbia.
in
her
complaint
in
the
court,
she
alleged
or
she
asked
for
injunctive
relief
pending
the
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission
and
she
alleged
that
if
an
injunction
would
not
issue
permitting
her
to
stay
at
employment,
she
would
lose
income
for
the
interim
period
and
unrebutted
charges
against
her
would
remain
in
her
personal
record.
the
district
court
immediately
granted
the
temporary
restraining
order
against
her
termination
and
set
a
hearing
for
the
following
week
on
the
merits.
for
describing
the
events
of
that
hearing
it
is
helpful
to
first
summarize
briefly
the
civil
service
regulations
pertaining
to
federal
probationary
employees
so
that
the
grounds
for
appeal
in
civil
service
commission
can
be
better
understood.
under
the
lloyd-lafollette
act
permanent
employees
in
the
competitive
service,
that
is,
employees
who
have
finished
their
one
year
probationary
term
maybe
discharged
only
for
cause.
but
the
act
does
not
provider
similar
protections
for
probationary
employees,
during
her
first
year
of
service
under
the
act
such
employees
maybe
terminated
at
will,
under
the
regulations
however,
civil
service
commission
certain
rights
are
granted
to
probationary
employees.
among
these
are
the
rights
not
to
be
terminated
because
of
invidious
class
based
discrimination,
marital
status,
political
activities
or
improper
discrimination
because
of
physical
disability.
in
addition
although
a
probationary
employee
maybe
terminated
upon
the
discovery
of
pre-employment
misconduct,
termination
on
that
ground
does
invoke
under
the
civil
service
regulations,
certain
procedural
protections,
the
employee
must
be
informed
of
the
charges
of
pre-employment
misconduct
against
him
and
he
must
be
given
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
those
charges
in
writing
before
the
termination
becomes
effective.
thus
when
the
respondent
appealed
to
the
civil
service
commission,
her
claim
was
that
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
the
termination
notice
recited
only
her
poor
work
performance,
she
alleged
that
the
fact
that
she
was
being
terminated
for
pre-employment
misconduct
that
is,
events
that
took
place
at
the
defense
intelligence
agency
in
her
previous
job.
if
she
prevailed
upon
that
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission,
she
would
be
reinstated
with
back
pay.
however,
at
that
time
upon
her
reinstatement
her
employer
would
remain
free
under
the
civil
service
regulations
to
go
forward
with
termination
proceedings.
all
that
gsa
would
have
to
do
at
that
time
would
be
to
inform
her
in
writing
as
to
the
charges
pre-employment
misconduct,
if
any,
made
against
her
and
permit
her
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
those
charges
before
she
was
dismissed.
in
other
words
the
respondent
had
no
right
to
retain
her
employment
under
the
constitution
or
under
any
statute
or
even
under
the
regulations.
all
she
had
was
a
right
to
certain
procedural
regularities.
i
return
now
to
the
hearing
which
was
held
before
the
district
court
on
her
motion
for
injunctive
relief.
at
that
time
government
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
one
of
equity
jurisdiction;
this
motion
was
not
active
upon
by
the
district
court.
instead
the
court
proceeded
to
consider
the
merits
of
respondent’s
requests
for
relief.
district
court
did
not
determine
whether
respondent
had
either
alleged
or
shown
that
she
was
in
danger
of
irreparable
injury
of
the
injunction
would
not
issue.
instead
the
district
court
first
took
up
the
question
whether
respondent
would
be
likely
to
show
before
the
civil
service
commission
that
she
in
fact
was
being
fired
for
pre-employment
misconduct.
that
was
an
issue
which
would
be
tried
by
the
commission
on
the
basis
of
written
submissions
only.
however,
the
district
court
was
not
content
to
review
the
case
on
the
basis
of
written
submissions
or
so.
instead
he
requested
that
mr.
sanders
the
gsa
official
who
had
ordered
respondents
termination,
come
to
the
court
and
testify
as
to
his
reasons
for
terminating
or
informing
respondent
that
her
employment
was
to
be
terminated.
mr.
sanders
at
that
time
was
on
vacation
in
california
and
he
was
not
available
to
testify.
therefore
the
district
court
continued
to
temporary
restraining
order
until
he
should
appear.
the
government
appealed
from
that
order
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
that
court
affirmed
cases
now
here
on
the
government’s
petition
for
certiorari
which
the
respondent
did
not
oppose.
in
the
meantime
the
respondents
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission
has
been
held
pending
the
outcome
of
this
suit.
i
turn
now
to
the
legal
issues
involved
here;
our
principal
contention
is
that
the
general
statutory
and
administrative
scheme
governing
federal
employment
precludes
the
exercise
of
equitable
jurisdiction
in
cases
such
as
this.
this
scheme
which
i
will
describe
in
a
moment
must
be
understood
in
its
decisional
context.
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
a
federal
employee
in
the
absence
of
any
protective
legislation
or
regulations
has
no
right
at
all
to
employment,
his
employment
maybe
terminated
at
will,
following
this
general
rule
the
court
expressly
held
in
white
against
berry
which
we
cited
on
brief,
that
the
federal
courts
have
no
general
equity
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
a
discharge
of
a
probationary
or
of
a
federal
employee
rather.
that
case
involved
a
discharge
which
allegedly
was
in
conflict
with
the
pertinent
civil
service
regulations
at
that
time.
in
short
white
against
berry
involves
essentially
the
identical
issue
here
and
this
court
could
not
affirm
that
overruling
of
that
case.
in
any
event,
that
decisional
background,
congress
in
1912
decided
to
extend
certain
additional
protections
to
certain
federal
employees.
it
enacted
the
lloyd-lafollette
act
which
as
i
have
previously
stated,
affords
to
non-probationary
employees
in
the
competitive
service.
the
protection
that
they
maybe
discharged
only
for
cause
subsequent
enactment
and
promulgated
regulations
established
for
such
employees.
the
elaborate
appeal
procedures
which
are
now
before
this
court
in
arnett
against
kennedy
which
was
argued
last
week.
however,
in
enacting
lloyd-lafollette
act
congress
determined
there
should
be
a
one
year
probationary
term
during
which
the
employee
would
not
be
afforded
such
procedures,
could
be
terminated
without
a
for
cause
determination.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
i
believe,
it
could
mr.
justice
blackmun.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
which
requires
the
civil
service
commission
to
provide
probationary
employees
kind
of
procedural
protections
which
the
respondent
here
is
relying
on.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
there
was
such
a
claim.
that
case
of
course
took
place
before
the
enactment
of
the
lloyd-lafollette
act
but
in
1883
congress
had
established
the
civil
service
commission
and
the
commission
had
promulgated
certain
regulations.
and
i
think
the
claim
in
white
against
berry
was
that
the
dismissal
was
in
violation
of
one
of
those
regulations.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it’s
my
understanding
that
she
is
mr.
justice
blackmun.
a
central
feature
of
the
scheme
however
which
applies
to
both
probationary
and
non-probationary
employees
like
is
that
termination
becomes
effective
prior
to
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission.
the
employees
have
certain
rights
of
appeal
as
to
probationary
employees
such
rights
are
limited
and
nevertheless
there
is
no
statutory
or
regulatory
provision
for
them
to
remain
in
their
employment
pending
the
appeal
with
civil
service
commission.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
correct,
that
involves
the
back
pay
act,
mr.
chief
justice
to
which
i
was
just
coming.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
back
pay
act
there
was
an
unfortunate
gap
governing
legislation.
if
an
employee
was
terminated
and
it
was
subsequently
determined
that,
that
termination
was
unlawful
and
the
employee
was
reinstated
nevertheless
the
employee
would
have
lost
pay
during
the
time
of
the
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission
and
there
was
no
mechanism
for
the
provision
of
such
back
pay
and
this
of
course
was
a
problem
which
was
aggravated
by
the
fact
that
the
courts
would
not
grant
interim
equitable
relief
because
following
this
courts
decision
in
white
against
berry
that
kind
of
relief
was
deemed
unavailable.
now
confronted
with
this
dilemma
congress
could
have
done
any
combination
of
three
things,
it
could
have
provided
civil
service
commission
with
authority
to
grant
back
pay
upon
reinstatement.
it
could
have
granted
the
civil
service
commission,
the
power
to
stay
a
termination,
pending
appeal
before
the
commission
in
appropriate
cases
or
could
have
explicitly
granted
to
the
courts
the
power
to
provide
the
kind
of
interim
equitable
relief
that
the
district
court
here
thought
that
it
could
provide.
the
congress
chose
only
to
do
the
first
of
these
three
things,
only
to
provide
the
civil
service
commission
with
a
power
to
award
back
pay
upon
reinstatement.
this
we
believe
was
a
deliberate
policy
choice
which
was
intended
to
accommodate
the
respective
interests
of
both
the
employees
and
their
employing
agencies.
under
the
back
pay
act,
if
the
employee's
discharge
was
unlawful,
he
is
fully
compensated
upon
reinstatement.
on
the
other
hand
under
the
act
he
has
no
right
to
remain
in
employment
pending
hearing
of
his
appeal
by
the
civil
service
commission.
we
believe
that
the
exercise
of
equitable
jurisdiction
which
the
district
court
here
engaged
in
is
disruptive
of
the
balance
which
congress
was
seeking
to
achieve
between
the
federal
employees
and
the
interest
of
the
government
in
an
efficient
civil
service.
the
retention
of
a
discharged
employee,
an
employee
who
has
received
his
termination
notice,
pending
review
before
the
commission
which
could
take
as
long
as
six
months
in
some
cases
would
be
bad
for
morale
of
the
agency
and
bad
for
discipline
with
that
particular
department
where
she
was
located.
and
if
the
termination
had
any
basis,
that
is,
if
in
fact
it
was
for
poor
performance,
then
it
would
be
bad
for
the
efficiency
of
the
employing
agency
as
well.
the
citizens
of
this
country
rely
upon
government
to
provide
a
wide
array
of
necessary
services
from
national
defense
to
social
welfare
and
the
ability
of
the
government
to
provide
these
services
quickly
and
efficiently
shouldn’t
be
interfered
with
or
hampered
by
the
forced
retention
of
an
employee
found
by
his
supervisors
to
be
incompetent
or
unwilling
to
follow
direction
or
for
some
other
reason
unqualified
for
further
service.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
exact
scope
of
the
ruling.
like
i
said,
it
wouldn’t
mr.
chief
justice.
the
court
did
not
restrict
itself
to
any
particular
class
of
employees.
i
suppose
this
would
apply
to
permanent
employees
as
well
as
probationary
employees
and
it
will
apply.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
would
assume
so.
and
so
far
as
i
can
tell
it's
not
limited
to
any
particular
group
of
employees,
it’s
not
limited
to
employees
whose
services
may
not
be
important
to
national
defense
or
to
any
other
important
government
operation.
so
that
in
the
future
case
the
court
might
decide
not
to
apply
that
rule
in
a
special
case,
there
is
nothing
in
the
courts
language
itself
which
was
so
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
believe
there
is
nothing
explicit
to
that
effect
however
there
is
nothing
which
grants
the
commission
power
to
do
that
and
the
commission
has
never
viewed
itself
as
having
the
power.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
suppose
in
essence
that’s
our
argument
that
the
remedy,
the
congress
has
in
fact
provided
a
general
remedy
at
law
available
to
all
federal
employees
and
therefore
there
should
not
be
a
case
by
case
determination
of
the
matter
of
adequacy.
now
i
think
it’s
important
to
realize
that
the
interest
of
the
employee
do
not
outweigh
the
cost
to
the
public,
if
the
employee
succeeds
upon
his
appeal
to
the
commission
then
interim
injunctive
relief
would
have
provided
him
with
absolutely
nothing
because
he
is
reinstated
with
back
pay
anyway.
on
the
other
hand
if
he
does
not
prevail
on
his
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission,
interim
injunctive
relief
would
have
simply
unjustly
enriched
him
at
the
expense
of
the
tax
payers,
at
the
expense
of
the
efficiency
of
the
government.
we
believe
that
interim
injunctive
relief
here
not
only
disturbs
the
balance
that
congress
meant
to
achieve
between
the
federal
employees
on
the
one
hand
and
the
needs
of
the
government
on
the
other.
that
would
also
offend
the
values
further
by
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
the
congress
has
left
to
the
civil
service
commission
the
responsibility
for
determining
in
first
instance,
employee
rights
subject
only
to
subsequent
judicial
review,
and
as
this
court
noted
in
arrow
transportation
and
wichita
board
of
trade
cases,
a
preliminary
court
ruling
on
the
merits
pending
decision
by
the
administrative
agency
can
be
disruptive
of
that
agency's
primary
jurisdiction.
now,
we
believe
that
would
be
especially
true
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
the
court
undertakes
the
scope
of
review
which
itself
is
far
broader
than
that
which
would
be
assumed
by
the
commission.
here
the
court
was
granting
a
full
evidentiary
hearing
where
its
fourth
commission
that
would
merely
be
a
decision
upon
written
evidence
in
that
affidavits.
respondent
in
her
brief,
i
think
essentially
ignores
the
policy
considerations
that
we
have
stated
here.
she
relies
primarily
or
almost
entirely
for
equitable
relief
upon
the
all
writs
act.
it
seems
clear
to
us
that,
that
act
must
be
read
in
light
of
the
pertinent
statutory
scheme.
the
act
itself
requires
the
issuance
of
writs
to
be
“agreeable
to
the
usages
and
principles
of
law”.
and
this
court
in
arrow
transportation
and
other
cases
has
held
at
a
federal
court’s
equitable
powers
under
the
act
if
granted
can
be
implicitly
withdrawn
by
the
pertinent
statutory
scheme,
that
is,
can
be
withdrawn
by
the
necessary
implication
of
the
statutory
scheme.
in
arrow
transportation
there
was
nothing
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
would
have
expressly
taken
away
from
the
district
courts
the
equitable
relief
they
sought
there
to
grant.
nevertheless,
the
general
administrative
scheme
was
such
this
court
viewed
equitable
relief
in
those
circumstances
to
be
inappropriate.
we
believe
a
similar
result
is
required
here.
but
we
would
contend
further
that
the
all
writs
act
does
not
properly
extend
to
the
kind
of
interim
relief
respondent
seeks
here
at
all.
that
act
simply
provides
that
the
federal
courts,
“may
issue
all
rates
necessary
or
appropriate
in
aid
of
their
respective
jurisdictions”'.
this
court
has
never
read
that
act
as
providing
a
broad
power
to
grant
pre-exhaustion
relief
in
all
cases.
this
court
has
permitted
pre-exhaustion
relief
of
the
kind
respondent
seeks
only
in
cases
where
it
is
necessary
to
ride
a
constitutional
wrong
or
to
preserve
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
upon
subsequent
review,
that
is,
preserve
the
possibility
of
effective
judicial
relief.
in
the
context
of
this
case,
i
think
that
a
reading
of
the
all
writs
act
which
is
so
limited
and
the
respondent
concedes
in
our
brief
that
the
all
writs
act
is
so
limited.
i
think
that
critically
disposes
off
this
case.
courts
below
did
not
rely
upon
their
power
to
preserve
jurisdiction.
they
didn't
discuss
that
issue
at
all.
they
instead
asserted
a
broad
power
to
provide
pre-exhaustion
relief,
whenever,
wherever
they
thought
it
necessary.
court
of
appeals
explicitly
saw
its
role
as
that
of
breathing
life
into
the
civil
service
regulations,
that
is,
of
giving
pre-exhaustion
equitable
enforcement
to
regulatory
rights.
whenever
the
likelihood,
even
a
preliminary
denial,
not
a
permanent
denial
but
even
a
preliminary
denial
of
those
rights
have
been
shown.
we
believe
that
the
all
writs
act
is
not
conferred
such
a
broad
power.
our
respondent
seeks
to
defend
the
decision
below
finally,
on
a
ground
that
interim
injunctive
relief
here
pending
exhaustion
for
administrative
remedies
may
have
been
necessary
to
preserve
jurisdiction.
respondent
however
does
not
suggest
how
in
this
kind
of
case,
interim
injunctive
relief
could
be
relevant
to
the
subsequent
social
jurisdiction.
the
immediate
discharge
of
the
respondent
from
the
gsa,
would
in
no
way
limit
district
court's
reviewing
authority
over
the
subsequent
appeal
from
the
civil
service
commission
determination,
nor
would
it
prevent
the
court
from
providing
the
kind
of
relief
and
the
only
kind
of
relief
which
congress
has
made
available
here,
reinstatement
with
back
pay.
for
that
reason,
the
district
court's
order
was
not
an
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
since
we
believe
the
court
has
no
authority
at
all,
we
feel
that
question
of
irreparable
injury
is
the
one
which
the
court
should
not
reach.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
what
she
is
seeking
is
a
preliminary
in
junction
against
agency
action.
she
is
not
really
seeking
the
stay
of
final
agency
action
pending
review
by
the
court--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
she
is
seeking
a
stay
of
the
termination,
but
we
feel
that
where
the
record
itself
does
not
have
direct
reviewing
authority
than
the
normal
standards
for
preliminary
injunctive
relief
against
an
agency
would
apply,
and
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
in
that
case,
the
court
recited
a
long
history
of
the
supreme
court
adjudication
to
that
effect,
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
our
contention
is
that
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
you
are
honest
to
the
facts,
mr.
justice.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
our
contention
is
that
the
determination
of
whether
the
employing
agency
itself
followed
civil
service
regulations,
is
one
left
in
the
first
instance
of
civil
service
commission.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no,
these
are
civil
service
regulations,
not
gsa
regulations.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
whether
she
could
establish
a
substantial
likelihood
of
prevailing
for
appeal.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct,
that's
what
he
sought
to
reply.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
have
nothing
further
your
honor.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
please
the
court?
the
issue
here
was
whether
in
a
case
involving
a
routine
termination
action
against
the
federal
probationary
employee.
federal
district
court
may
enjoin
the
termination
pending
that
employee's
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission.
the
facts
are
as
follows.
in
january
1971,
respondent
was
hired
as
a
program
analyst
in
the
general
services
administration
and
a
salary
of
about
$18,000
a
year.
four
months
later,
one
of
her
immediate
supervisors
sent
to
his
supervisor,
mr.
sanders,
a
memorandum
recommending
that
her
employment
be
terminated.
his
recommendation
set
forth
a
variety
of
reasons
why
her
work
performance
was
considered
to
be
unsatisfactory
and
that
among
these
were
her
failure
to
follow
the
instructions
of
her
supervisor,
follow
office
direction
generally
and
her
inability
to
get
along
with
her
fellow
employees.
the
memorandum
went
on
however
to
state
that
she
had
experienced
difficulties
with
her
previous
employer,
the
defense
intelligence
agency.
after
studying
this
recommendation
mr.
sanders
issued
to
the
respondent
a
notice
terminating
her
employment
effective
to
next
week,
the
termination
notice
stated
expressly
that
the
reasons
for
her
termination
or
for
failure
to
abide
by
office
of
procedure
and
to
accept
the
direction
of
her
supervisors.
on
receiving
this
termination
notice
the
respondent
filed
an
appeal
with
the
civil
service
commission
and
lodged
a
complaint
in
the
united
states
district
court
to
the
district
of
columbia.
in
her
complaint
in
the
court,
she
alleged
or
she
asked
for
injunctive
relief
pending
the
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission
and
she
alleged
that
if
an
injunction
would
not
issue
permitting
her
to
stay
at
employment,
she
would
lose
income
for
the
interim
period
and
unrebutted
charges
against
her
would
remain
in
her
personal
record.
the
district
court
immediately
granted
the
temporary
restraining
order
against
her
termination
and
set
a
hearing
for
the
following
week
on
the
merits.
for
describing
the
events
of
that
hearing
it
is
helpful
to
first
summarize
briefly
the
civil
service
regulations
pertaining
to
federal
probationary
employees
so
that
the
grounds
for
appeal
in
civil
service
commission
can
be
better
understood.
under
the
lloyd-lafollette
act
permanent
employees
in
the
competitive
service,
that
is,
employees
who
have
finished
their
one
year
probationary
term
maybe
discharged
only
for
cause.
but
the
act
does
not
provider
similar
protections
for
probationary
employees,
during
her
first
year
of
service
under
the
act
such
employees
maybe
terminated
at
will,
under
the
regulations
however,
civil
service
commission
certain
rights
are
granted
to
probationary
employees.
among
these
are
the
rights
not
to
be
terminated
because
of
invidious
class
based
discrimination,
marital
status,
political
activities
or
improper
discrimination
because
of
physical
disability.
in
addition
although
a
probationary
employee
maybe
terminated
upon
the
discovery
of
pre-employment
misconduct,
termination
on
that
ground
does
invoke
under
the
civil
service
regulations,
certain
procedural
protections,
the
employee
must
be
informed
of
the
charges
of
pre-employment
misconduct
against
him
and
he
must
be
given
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
those
charges
in
writing
before
the
termination
becomes
effective.
thus
when
the
respondent
appealed
to
the
civil
service
commission,
her
claim
was
that
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
the
termination
notice
recited
only
her
poor
work
performance,
she
alleged
that
the
fact
that
she
was
being
terminated
for
pre-employment
misconduct
that
is,
events
that
took
place
at
the
defense
intelligence
agency
in
her
previous
job.
if
she
prevailed
upon
that
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission,
she
would
be
reinstated
with
back
pay.
however,
at
that
time
upon
her
reinstatement
her
employer
would
remain
free
under
the
civil
service
regulations
to
go
forward
with
termination
proceedings.
all
that
gsa
would
have
to
do
at
that
time
would
be
to
inform
her
in
writing
as
to
the
charges
pre-employment
misconduct,
if
any,
made
against
her
and
permit
her
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
those
charges
before
she
was
dismissed.
in
other
words
the
respondent
had
no
right
to
retain
her
employment
under
the
constitution
or
under
any
statute
or
even
under
the
regulations.
all
she
had
was
a
right
to
certain
procedural
regularities.
i
return
now
to
the
hearing
which
was
held
before
the
district
court
on
her
motion
for
injunctive
relief.
at
that
time
government
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
one
of
equity
jurisdiction;
this
motion
was
not
active
upon
by
the
district
court.
instead
the
court
proceeded
to
consider
the
merits
of
respondent’s
requests
for
relief.
district
court
did
not
determine
whether
respondent
had
either
alleged
or
shown
that
she
was
in
danger
of
irreparable
injury
of
the
injunction
would
not
issue.
instead
the
district
court
first
took
up
the
question
whether
respondent
would
be
likely
to
show
before
the
civil
service
commission
that
she
in
fact
was
being
fired
for
pre-employment
misconduct.
that
was
an
issue
which
would
be
tried
by
the
commission
on
the
basis
of
written
submissions
only.
however,
the
district
court
was
not
content
to
review
the
case
on
the
basis
of
written
submissions
or
so.
instead
he
requested
that
mr.
sanders
the
gsa
official
who
had
ordered
respondents
termination,
come
to
the
court
and
testify
as
to
his
reasons
for
terminating
or
informing
respondent
that
her
employment
was
to
be
terminated.
mr.
sanders
at
that
time
was
on
vacation
in
california
and
he
was
not
available
to
testify.
therefore
the
district
court
continued
to
temporary
restraining
order
until
he
should
appear.
the
government
appealed
from
that
order
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
that
court
affirmed
cases
now
here
on
the
government’s
petition
for
certiorari
which
the
respondent
did
not
oppose.
in
the
meantime
the
respondents
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission
has
been
held
pending
the
outcome
of
this
suit.
i
turn
now
to
the
legal
issues
involved
here;
our
principal
contention
is
that
the
general
statutory
and
administrative
scheme
governing
federal
employment
precludes
the
exercise
of
equitable
jurisdiction
in
cases
such
as
this.
this
scheme
which
i
will
describe
in
a
moment
must
be
understood
in
its
decisional
context.
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
a
federal
employee
in
the
absence
of
any
protective
legislation
or
regulations
has
no
right
at
all
to
employment,
his
employment
maybe
terminated
at
will,
following
this
general
rule
the
court
expressly
held
in
white
against
berry
which
we
cited
on
brief,
that
the
federal
courts
have
no
general
equity
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
a
discharge
of
a
probationary
or
of
a
federal
employee
rather.
that
case
involved
a
discharge
which
allegedly
was
in
conflict
with
the
pertinent
civil
service
regulations
at
that
time.
in
short
white
against
berry
involves
essentially
the
identical
issue
here
and
this
court
could
not
affirm
that
overruling
of
that
case.
in
any
event,
that
decisional
background,
congress
in
1912
decided
to
extend
certain
additional
protections
to
certain
federal
employees.
it
enacted
the
lloyd-lafollette
act
which
as
i
have
previously
stated,
affords
to
non-probationary
employees
in
the
competitive
service.
the
protection
that
they
maybe
discharged
only
for
cause
subsequent
enactment
and
promulgated
regulations
established
for
such
employees.
the
elaborate
appeal
procedures
which
are
now
before
this
court
in
arnett
against
kennedy
which
was
argued
last
week.
however,
in
enacting
lloyd-lafollette
act
congress
determined
there
should
be
a
one
year
probationary
term
during
which
the
employee
would
not
be
afforded
such
procedures,
could
be
terminated
without
a
for
cause
determination.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
i
believe,
it
could
mr.
justice
blackmun.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
which
requires
the
civil
service
commission
to
provide
probationary
employees
kind
of
procedural
protections
which
the
respondent
here
is
relying
on.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
that
there
was
such
a
claim.
that
case
of
course
took
place
before
the
enactment
of
the
lloyd-lafollette
act
but
in
1883
congress
had
established
the
civil
service
commission
and
the
commission
had
promulgated
certain
regulations.
and
i
think
the
claim
in
white
against
berry
was
that
the
dismissal
was
in
violation
of
one
of
those
regulations.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
it’s
my
understanding
that
she
is
mr.
justice
blackmun.
a
central
feature
of
the
scheme
however
which
applies
to
both
probationary
and
non-probationary
employees
like
is
that
termination
becomes
effective
prior
to
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission.
the
employees
have
certain
rights
of
appeal
as
to
probationary
employees
such
rights
are
limited
and
nevertheless
there
is
no
statutory
or
regulatory
provision
for
them
to
remain
in
their
employment
pending
the
appeal
with
civil
service
commission.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that’s
correct,
that
involves
the
back
pay
act,
mr.
chief
justice
to
which
i
was
just
coming.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
back
pay
act
there
was
an
unfortunate
gap
governing
legislation.
if
an
employee
was
terminated
and
it
was
subsequently
determined
that,
that
termination
was
unlawful
and
the
employee
was
reinstated
nevertheless
the
employee
would
have
lost
pay
during
the
time
of
the
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission
and
there
was
no
mechanism
for
the
provision
of
such
back
pay
and
this
of
course
was
a
problem
which
was
aggravated
by
the
fact
that
the
courts
would
not
grant
interim
equitable
relief
because
following
this
courts
decision
in
white
against
berry
that
kind
of
relief
was
deemed
unavailable.
now
confronted
with
this
dilemma
congress
could
have
done
any
combination
of
three
things,
it
could
have
provided
civil
service
commission
with
authority
to
grant
back
pay
upon
reinstatement.
it
could
have
granted
the
civil
service
commission,
the
power
to
stay
a
termination,
pending
appeal
before
the
commission
in
appropriate
cases
or
could
have
explicitly
granted
to
the
courts
the
power
to
provide
the
kind
of
interim
equitable
relief
that
the
district
court
here
thought
that
it
could
provide.
the
congress
chose
only
to
do
the
first
of
these
three
things,
only
to
provide
the
civil
service
commission
with
a
power
to
award
back
pay
upon
reinstatement.
this
we
believe
was
a
deliberate
policy
choice
which
was
intended
to
accommodate
the
respective
interests
of
both
the
employees
and
their
employing
agencies.
under
the
back
pay
act,
if
the
employee's
discharge
was
unlawful,
he
is
fully
compensated
upon
reinstatement.
on
the
other
hand
under
the
act
he
has
no
right
to
remain
in
employment
pending
hearing
of
his
appeal
by
the
civil
service
commission.
we
believe
that
the
exercise
of
equitable
jurisdiction
which
the
district
court
here
engaged
in
is
disruptive
of
the
balance
which
congress
was
seeking
to
achieve
between
the
federal
employees
and
the
interest
of
the
government
in
an
efficient
civil
service.
the
retention
of
a
discharged
employee,
an
employee
who
has
received
his
termination
notice,
pending
review
before
the
commission
which
could
take
as
long
as
six
months
in
some
cases
would
be
bad
for
morale
of
the
agency
and
bad
for
discipline
with
that
particular
department
where
she
was
located.
and
if
the
termination
had
any
basis,
that
is,
if
in
fact
it
was
for
poor
performance,
then
it
would
be
bad
for
the
efficiency
of
the
employing
agency
as
well.
the
citizens
of
this
country
rely
upon
government
to
provide
a
wide
array
of
necessary
services
from
national
defense
to
social
welfare
and
the
ability
of
the
government
to
provide
these
services
quickly
and
efficiently
shouldn’t
be
interfered
with
or
hampered
by
the
forced
retention
of
an
employee
found
by
his
supervisors
to
be
incompetent
or
unwilling
to
follow
direction
or
for
some
other
reason
unqualified
for
further
service.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
the
exact
scope
of
the
ruling.
like
i
said,
it
wouldn’t
mr.
chief
justice.
the
court
did
not
restrict
itself
to
any
particular
class
of
employees.
i
suppose
this
would
apply
to
permanent
employees
as
well
as
probationary
employees
and
it
will
apply.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
would
assume
so.
and
so
far
as
i
can
tell
it's
not
limited
to
any
particular
group
of
employees,
it’s
not
limited
to
employees
whose
services
may
not
be
important
to
national
defense
or
to
any
other
important
government
operation.
so
that
in
the
future
case
the
court
might
decide
not
to
apply
that
rule
in
a
special
case,
there
is
nothing
in
the
courts
language
itself
which
was
so
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
believe
there
is
nothing
explicit
to
that
effect
however
there
is
nothing
which
grants
the
commission
power
to
do
that
and
the
commission
has
never
viewed
itself
as
having
the
power.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
suppose
in
essence
that’s
our
argument
that
the
remedy,
the
congress
has
in
fact
provided
a
general
remedy
at
law
available
to
all
federal
employees
and
therefore
there
should
not
be
a
case
by
case
determination
of
the
matter
of
adequacy.
now
i
think
it’s
important
to
realize
that
the
interest
of
the
employee
do
not
outweigh
the
cost
to
the
public,
if
the
employee
succeeds
upon
his
appeal
to
the
commission
then
interim
injunctive
relief
would
have
provided
him
with
absolutely
nothing
because
he
is
reinstated
with
back
pay
anyway.
on
the
other
hand
if
he
does
not
prevail
on
his
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission,
interim
injunctive
relief
would
have
simply
unjustly
enriched
him
at
the
expense
of
the
tax
payers,
at
the
expense
of
the
efficiency
of
the
government.
we
believe
that
interim
injunctive
relief
here
not
only
disturbs
the
balance
that
congress
meant
to
achieve
between
the
federal
employees
on
the
one
hand
and
the
needs
of
the
government
on
the
other.
that
would
also
offend
the
values
further
by
the
exhaustion
doctrine.
the
congress
has
left
to
the
civil
service
commission
the
responsibility
for
determining
in
first
instance,
employee
rights
subject
only
to
subsequent
judicial
review,
and
as
this
court
noted
in
arrow
transportation
and
wichita
board
of
trade
cases,
a
preliminary
court
ruling
on
the
merits
pending
decision
by
the
administrative
agency
can
be
disruptive
of
that
agency's
primary
jurisdiction.
now,
we
believe
that
would
be
especially
true
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
the
court
undertakes
the
scope
of
review
which
itself
is
far
broader
than
that
which
would
be
assumed
by
the
commission.
here
the
court
was
granting
a
full
evidentiary
hearing
where
its
fourth
commission
that
would
merely
be
a
decision
upon
written
evidence
in
that
affidavits.
respondent
in
her
brief,
i
think
essentially
ignores
the
policy
considerations
that
we
have
stated
here.
she
relies
primarily
or
almost
entirely
for
equitable
relief
upon
the
all
writs
act.
it
seems
clear
to
us
that,
that
act
must
be
read
in
light
of
the
pertinent
statutory
scheme.
the
act
itself
requires
the
issuance
of
writs
to
be
“agreeable
to
the
usages
and
principles
of
law”.
and
this
court
in
arrow
transportation
and
other
cases
has
held
at
a
federal
court’s
equitable
powers
under
the
act
if
granted
can
be
implicitly
withdrawn
by
the
pertinent
statutory
scheme,
that
is,
can
be
withdrawn
by
the
necessary
implication
of
the
statutory
scheme.
in
arrow
transportation
there
was
nothing
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
would
have
expressly
taken
away
from
the
district
courts
the
equitable
relief
they
sought
there
to
grant.
nevertheless,
the
general
administrative
scheme
was
such
this
court
viewed
equitable
relief
in
those
circumstances
to
be
inappropriate.
we
believe
a
similar
result
is
required
here.
but
we
would
contend
further
that
the
all
writs
act
does
not
properly
extend
to
the
kind
of
interim
relief
respondent
seeks
here
at
all.
that
act
simply
provides
that
the
federal
courts,
“may
issue
all
rates
necessary
or
appropriate
in
aid
of
their
respective
jurisdictions”'.
this
court
has
never
read
that
act
as
providing
a
broad
power
to
grant
pre-exhaustion
relief
in
all
cases.
this
court
has
permitted
pre-exhaustion
relief
of
the
kind
respondent
seeks
only
in
cases
where
it
is
necessary
to
ride
a
constitutional
wrong
or
to
preserve
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
upon
subsequent
review,
that
is,
preserve
the
possibility
of
effective
judicial
relief.
in
the
context
of
this
case,
i
think
that
a
reading
of
the
all
writs
act
which
is
so
limited
and
the
respondent
concedes
in
our
brief
that
the
all
writs
act
is
so
limited.
i
think
that
critically
disposes
off
this
case.
courts
below
did
not
rely
upon
their
power
to
preserve
jurisdiction.
they
didn't
discuss
that
issue
at
all.
they
instead
asserted
a
broad
power
to
provide
pre-exhaustion
relief,
whenever,
wherever
they
thought
it
necessary.
court
of
appeals
explicitly
saw
its
role
as
that
of
breathing
life
into
the
civil
service
regulations,
that
is,
of
giving
pre-exhaustion
equitable
enforcement
to
regulatory
rights.
whenever
the
likelihood,
even
a
preliminary
denial,
not
a
permanent
denial
but
even
a
preliminary
denial
of
those
rights
have
been
shown.
we
believe
that
the
all
writs
act
is
not
conferred
such
a
broad
power.
our
respondent
seeks
to
defend
the
decision
below
finally,
on
a
ground
that
interim
injunctive
relief
here
pending
exhaustion
for
administrative
remedies
may
have
been
necessary
to
preserve
jurisdiction.
respondent
however
does
not
suggest
how
in
this
kind
of
case,
interim
injunctive
relief
could
be
relevant
to
the
subsequent
social
jurisdiction.
the
immediate
discharge
of
the
respondent
from
the
gsa,
would
in
no
way
limit
district
court's
reviewing
authority
over
the
subsequent
appeal
from
the
civil
service
commission
determination,
nor
would
it
prevent
the
court
from
providing
the
kind
of
relief
and
the
only
kind
of
relief
which
congress
has
made
available
here,
reinstatement
with
back
pay.
for
that
reason,
the
district
court's
order
was
not
an
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
since
we
believe
the
court
has
no
authority
at
all,
we
feel
that
question
of
irreparable
injury
is
the
one
which
the
court
should
not
reach.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
what
she
is
seeking
is
a
preliminary
in
junction
against
agency
action.
she
is
not
really
seeking
the
stay
of
final
agency
action
pending
review
by
the
court--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
well,
she
is
seeking
a
stay
of
the
termination,
but
we
feel
that
where
the
record
itself
does
not
have
direct
reviewing
authority
than
the
normal
standards
for
preliminary
injunctive
relief
against
an
agency
would
apply,
and
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
in
that
case,
the
court
recited
a
long
history
of
the
supreme
court
adjudication
to
that
effect,
that's
correct.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
our
contention
is
that
--
mr.
keith
a.
jones
you
are
honest
to
the
facts,
mr.
justice.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
yes,
our
contention
is
that
the
determination
of
whether
the
employing
agency
itself
followed
civil
service
regulations,
is
one
left
in
the
first
instance
of
civil
service
commission.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
no,
these
are
civil
service
regulations,
not
gsa
regulations.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
whether
she
could
establish
a
substantial
likelihood
of
prevailing
for
appeal.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
that's
correct,
that's
what
he
sought
to
reply.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
keith
a.
jones
i
have
nothing
further
your
honor.
