chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
72-403,
sampson
against
murray.
mr.
jones
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understand
that
mr.
jones,
the
government's
position
is
that
there
is
no
equity
jurisdiction
at
all
in
this
kind
of
a
case
because
there
is
a
fully
adequate
remedy
at
law
in
terms
of
reinstating
the
employee
and
giving
back
pay
with
interests
and
perhaps
costs
if
the
termination
for
any
reason
is
determined
to
have
been
improper.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
with
this
folding
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
now
stands
,
apply
to
let
us
say
the
air
traffic
controllers
work
for
the
commerce
department
at
airports?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
it
applies
to
probationary
then
there
is
a
fortiori
that
would
apply
to
permanent
employees
with
their
greater
degree
of
protection.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
relying
on
the
proposition
that
no
equitable
remedy
is
available
if
there
is
remedy
at
law
in
terms
of
backpay
and
reinstatement?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
there
are
two
sets
of
standards
in
this
area,
one
relating
to
agency
action
in
broad
sense
of
the
regulatory
agencies,
federal
communications,
federal
power,
civil
aeronautics
board
and
so
forth,
and
a
different
standard
enunciated
by
this
court
in
connection
with
employment
termination.
for
example,
in
cafeteria
workers,
didn't
this
say
court
say
flatly
that
an
employee
may
be
summarily
discharged?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
government's
position
at
that
time
was,
was
about
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
the
document
served
on
her
giving
the
reasons
for
termination,
applying
the
parameters
of
any
inquiry
that
can
be
made
at
that
preliminary
stage,
before
it
goes
to
appeal.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
(inaudible)
regulations,
solicitor
general.
i
thought
the
way
judge
gasch
looked
at
it,
it
was
a
gsa
--
i
don't
know
what
the
identification
maybe
with
civil
service
regulation.
but
the
way
he
handled
it
was,
whether
the
government
followed
its
own
regulation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
mr.
mcgrew.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
suppose
you
would
agree
mr
mcgrew
that
the
back
pay
act
was
an
effect
to
redress
somewhat
inequitable
balance
that
had
existed,
with
reference
to
termination
of
government
employees,
it
was
a
hardship
on
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
in
mind
what
the
government
relied
on
in
its
brief
and
its
dissenting
opinion
in
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
senator
langer,
that
was
the
manager
of
the
bill,
and
he
said
that
the
act
provides
that
agency
may
remove
any
employee
at
any
time
but
that
the
employee
shall
then
have
the
right
to
appeal.
now
that's
the
appeal
to
the
civil
service
commission.
when
he
is
removed,
he
is
of
course
off
the
payroll.
if
he
wins
the
appeal
that
is
provided
that
he
shall
be
paid
for
the
time
during
which
he
was
suspended,
that
is,
he
gets
back
pay
along
with
his
reinstatement.
that
was
a
remedy
that
wasn't
available
before
that
act.
now
isn't
that
by
inference,
the
suggestions
that
that's
the
exclusive
course
as
justice
white
has
pointed
out,
that
civil
service
commission
was
given
no
power
to
stay
and
senator
langer's
statement
sounds
as
though,
he
was
telling
the
senator
is
the
manager
of
this
bill,
that
no
one
would
have
the
power
to
stay
that
early,
that
first
step.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
you
are
focusing
narrowly
on
this
one
proposition
that
the
agency
was
required
to
--
or
that
the
court
had
the
power
to
inquire
into
the
decisional
process
of
the
agency
at
the
first
stage.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no,
but
doesn't
that
have
to
be
read
along
with
the
provisions
of
the
one
year
probation
which
gives
an
absolute
right
of
termination
during
one
year
without
any
reason.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
the
most
preliminary
power
that
an
employer
could
have
over
an
employee?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
is
power
before
the
administrative
procedures
in
the
civil
service
commission
have
been
exhausted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
might
be
different
after
the
civil
service
commission
had
acted
then
it
would
be
before,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
fifth
circuit
case
was
not
under
the
lloyd-lafollette
act
of
course.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
also
it's
not
under
the
lloyd-lafollette
act.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
has
the
court
of
appeal's
opinion
been
extent
two
years.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
it
was
the
district
court
that
was
that
far
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
let
me
go
back
to
one
other
question.
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion
relied
heavily
on
virginia
petroleum
jobbers
association,
the
case
on
which
i
sat
when
i
was
there
if
you
may
recall
but
that
line
of
cases
are
all
dealing
with
agency
--
regulatory
agencies
where
if
the
decision
is
reversed
there
is
no
equivalent
to
reinstatement
back
pay,
is
that
not
true?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
that
the
propositions
laid
down
in
the
virginia
petroleum
jobbers
case
are
somewhat
different
just
from
this
kind
of
situation
with
respect
to
the
availability
of
an
adequate
remedy
of
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
whatever
that
may
be,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
in
this
case,
that
would
indicate
which
would
be
drawn
in
one
of
those
exceptions
but
going
back
to
virginia
petroleum
jobbers,
it
is
quite
clear
that
all
the
equitable
relief,
given
interim
relief
was
premised
on
the
proposition
that
there
was
no
remedy
available.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
suppose
if
the
officially
commend
the
judge
gasch's
court
and
had
testified
nor
i
could
the
terminating
that
petitioner
--
i
didn't
rely
at
all
on
the
records
of
the
other
agencies
i
did
this
solely
on
the
record
with
the
gsa.
this
case
would
never
have
been
here,
would
it?m
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
mcgrew.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
jones?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
case
is
submitted.
thank
you
gentlemen.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
justice
rehnquist
will
announce
the
opinions
in
sampson
against
murray
and
winward
shipping
against
american
radio
association.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
72-403,
sampson
against
murray.
mr.

you
may
proceed

you
