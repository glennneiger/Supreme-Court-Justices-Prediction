mr.
edward
r.
korman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
department
of
justice
appears
here
today
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
the
federal
communications
commission
to
urge
affirmance
of
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
which
sustained
the
federal
communications
commission’s
construction
of
an
act
of
congress
title
v
of
the
independent
offices
appropriations
act
of
1952.
the
issue
presented
here
is
whether
the
activities
undertaken
by
the
commission
with
regard
to
the
catv
industry,
come
within
the
categories
prescribed
in
title
v
of
the
act,
and
therefore,
compelled
the
commission
to
impose
an
annual
fee
of
30
cents
per
subscriber
per
month
to
be
paid
by
each
catv
system
in
order
to
reimburse
the
taxpayers
of
the
united
states
for
the
costs
incurred
in
sustaining
these
activities.
these
costs
exceeded
$1
million
in
1970-71,
and
will
exceed
$3
million
in
the
coming
fiscal
year.
the
amount
of
the
fee
as
calculated
initially
came
to
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
one-half
of
1%
of
the
gross
revenues
of
the
catv
industry.
a
number
of
cases
involving
the
catv
industry
have
come
before
this
court
in
recent
years,
and
there
is
really
little
need
to
discuss
here
the
nature
of
that
industry
where
its
phenomenal
growth
into
a
$500
million
a
year
business,
serving
some
seven
million
subscribers.
now,
$500
million
a
year
figure
is
almost
doubled
that
of
only
four
years
ago.
essentially,
as
the
chief
justice
stated
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
midwest
video
case,
catv
systems
exploit
existing
broadcast
signals
to
which
they
make
no
contribution
by
plucking
them
from
the
air,
and
transmitting
them
over
cables,
generally
strung
over
telephone
poles
to
subscribers
who
are
hooked
in
to
the
system,
and
who
pay
generally
speaking
a
monthly
fee
in
the
neighborhood
of
$5
to
$6
a
month.
now,
the
implications
of
such
a
rapidly
growing
system
through
the
carriage
of
broadcast
signals
place
the
catv’s
activities
clearly
within
the
ambit
of
the
regulatory
jurisdiction
of
the
commission,
which
is
charged
by
congress
in
section
151
of
title
47
to
make
available
to
all
the
people
of
the
united
states,
a
rapid,
efficient,
nationwide,
and
worldwide
radio
communication
service
with
adequate
facilities
at
reasonable
charges.
petitioner
here
charges
--
challenges
the
annual
fees
imposed
by
the
commission
on
several
grounds,
and
before
getting
into
them,
i
would
like
to
speak
for
a
moment
to
the
bureau
of
the
budget
circular
that
has
been
referred
to
by
petitioner.
first,
that
is
not
and
does
not
purport
to
be
“an
interpretation”
of
title
v.
it
simply
is
what
it
says
it
is,
namely
some
general
policies
for
developing
an
equitable
and
uniform
system
of
charges.
the
bureau
of
the
budget
circular
was
adopted
pursuant
to
the
statement
in
title
v
of
the
act
which
says
that
in
cases
--
in
the
case
of
agencies
in
the
executive
branch,
the
fee
shall
be
uniform
as
practicable
subject
to
policies,
such
policies
as
the
president
may
prescribe
for
agencies
in
the
executive
branch
which
the
federal
communications
commission
clearly
is
not.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
bureau
of
circular
itself
is
addressed
to
heads
of
executive
agencies
and
establishments.
moreover,
it’s
quite
true
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
that
the
bureau
of
the
budget
does
have
extensive
leverage
which
it
can
use
even
with
respect
to
an
independent
regulatory
agency,
but
it
should
also
be
pointed
out
that
the
bureau
of
the
budget
is
fully
aware
of
what
the
communications
commission
has
done
every
year.
it’s
been
advised
that
the
end
of
every
year
precisely
what
the
commission
is
doing.
indeed
it
was
at
the
urging
in
part
of
the
bureau
of
the
budget,
now
the
office
of
management
budget,
that
the
commission
acted
to
substantially
increase
its
fees
schedule
so
that
the
commission
is
not
bound
by
the
particular
language
of
the
budget
bureau
circular.
if
it
was
bound
by
it,
it
would
seem
that
the
determination
of
the
executive
branch
which
i
represent
here
as
well,
that
the
commission
has
complied
with
those
guidelines,
should
be
sufficient.
this
is
not
a
regulation,
it
doesn’t
have
the
force
and
effect
of
statute,
it’s
merely
policy
guidelines.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
the
address
of
the
notice
as
it
appears
in
the
appendix
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
it
may
very
well
have
been,
i’m
not
certain
of
that.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i’m
not
certain
of
whether
they
were
actually
on
the
mailing
list.
i
would
think
that
they’d
probably
should
be,
even
though
they’re
not
technically
bound
simply
because
it’s
not
a
bad
idea
for
them
to
try
and
formulate
their
policies
consistently
with
other
agencies
of
the
executive
branch
if
they
feel
they
can
do
so
consistent
with
their
obligations
under
the
statute.
i
mean
we’re
not
and
the
commission
of
course
looked
at
these
guidelines
and
attempted
to
follow
them,
and
we
believe
they
have
been
formulating
the
annual
fee.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct,
but
nevertheless
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct,
but
nevertheless,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
i’m
not
suggesting
that
it
would
be
undesirable.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
think
it’s
generally
it’s
a
good
thing
to
have
a
uniform
set
of
schedules.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no
i
mean,
the
federal
communications
commission
as
far
as
the
general
public
is
concerned,
and
as
far
as
the
industry
is
subject
to
regulation,
it’s
a
small
matter
to
them
whether
technically
the
federal
communications
commission
is
viewed
as
part
of
the
executive
branch,
or
whether
it's
viewed
as
a
creature
of
congress
and
an
independent
regulatory
agency.
and
it
would
seem
desirable
that
where
you
have,
at
least
in
the
eyes
of
the
public,
a
view
that
it's
simply
part
of
the
government,
that
agencies
which
appear
to
be
part
of
the
government
act
in
a
matter
that’s
consistent,
provided
that
the
particular
agency
feels
that
it
can
act
that
way
and
still
adhere
to
the
mandate
which
congress
has
given
it.
now,
petitioner
challenges
the
annual
fee
on
two
grounds.
first
it
contends
--
let
me
say
one
more
thing,
we’re
not
suggesting
that
we’re
in
anyway
conceding
that
we
haven’t
complied
with
this
bureau
of
the
budget
circular.
i
just
want
to
put
our
position
in
proper
perspective,
in
that
many
of
the
words
and
standards
that
have
been
suggested
by
the
petitioners
applying
here,
words
like
identifiable,
beneficiary,
measurable
unit
of
government
service,
all
of
those
things
do
not
appear
on
the
statute.
and
as
petitioner
conceded
in
response
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question,
the
question
presented
here
and
as
presented
in
the
first
question
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
turns
on
the
construction
of
the
act,
and
not
the
bureau
of
the
budget
circular.
now,
first
it’s
petitioner’s
contention
that
the
commission’s
function
is
to
serve
the
public
interest
and
that
they
do
not
receive
any
benefits
from
regulation.
indeed
they
claim
that
the
overall
effect
of
the
commission's
regulation
has
affirmatively
hindered
their
economic
growth.
second,
they
claim
that
even
if
the
catv
industry
does
receive
benefits,
the
commission
erred
in
the
manner
in
which
it
applied
the
criteria
in
title
v
in
calculating
the
fee.
we
submit
that
both
of
these
claims
were
properly
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals.
first,
with
respect
to
the
petitioner’s
initial
claim,
we
believe
that
the
issue
here
does
not
depend
on
whether
the
catv
industry
as
a
whole
benefited
or
was
harmed
because
or
as
a
result
of
commission
regulation.
it
seems
to
us
that
everyone
who
enters
a
business
which
is
effective
with
the
public
interest
must
of
necessity
expect
to
be
regulated.
and
regulation
means
being
told
to
do
things
that
you
don’t
like
as
well
as
things
that
you
would
like
to
undertake.
they
must
expect
to
be
told
that
all
of
their
activities
must
be
conducted
in
a
manner
subordinate
for
the
public
interest
whether
they
like
it
or
not.
yet
the
language
of
title
v
clearly
suggests
that
those
subject
to
regulation
pay
the
costs
of
that
regulation
in
at
least
several
instances
which
are
relevant
to
this
particular
case.
this
is
clearly
surely
shown
by
the
references
to
charges
for
the
cost
of
issuing
licenses,
permits,
certificates,
or
similar
things
of
value.
now,
the
only
reason
when
these
are
licensed
to
do
anything
is
because
there’s
a
regulatory
program
which
requires
you
to
get
the
license,
and
yet
congress
said
that
to
the
fullest
extent
possible,
the
agency
should
recover
the
cost
of
issuing
that
license,
permit,
certificate,
or
other
thing
of
value.
moreover,
it
is
equally
clear
that
congress
intended
that
regulatory
agencies
not
only
be
reimbursed
“to
the
fullest
extent
possible”
for
the
cost
of
issuing
these
license,
but
that
they
also
recover
costs
incurred
in
activities
which
confer
benefits
which
are
special,
that
is
benefits
which
the
regulated
industry
would
not
receive,
but
for
the
fact
that
they
were
being
regulated
by
the
commission.
and
it’s
our
submission
that
the
commission’s
regulation
of
the
catv
industry
implicates
both
aspects
of
this
act.
in
the
first
place,
since
1972,
commission
regulations
have
required
all
catv
stations
to
obtain
certificates
of
compliance.
that
is
the
commission
has
adopted
regulations
with
respect
to
the
franchising
of
catv
stations
which
divide
responsibility
between
the
local
community
and
the
federal
communications
commission.
essentially
what
the
commission
does
is
set
out
broad
guidelines
which
have
to
be
followed
by
the
local
agency,
local
authority
in
issuing
its
certificates.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
in
the
sense
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
it
couldn’t
operate
without
it.
no
i
don’t
know
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
the
statute
uses
words
which
are
not
limited
to
license.
it
says
license,
certificate,
permit,
or
other
things
of
value.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
it
certainly
not
the
same
as
the
broadcast
license.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well
it’s
not.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
it’s
called
the
certificate
of
compliance
without
which
they
couldn’t
engage
in
this
activity.
now
whether
that
comes
within
a
dictionary
definition
of
a
license,
it
certainly
equivalent
of
it,
and
i
think
the
language
of
the
statute
is
so
worded
as
to
indicate
that
congress
intended
that
that
ought
to
be
covered.
without
it
they
couldn’t
operate.
of
course
without
in
a
sense
there’s
a
joint
franchising
authority
here
because
without
local
authority
of
the
fcc,
the
catv
station
couldn’t
string
up
its
cables.
but
all
that
authority
is
to
string
up
its
cables.
they
still
have
to
get
the
commission’s
approval
to
carry
the
signals
over
the
wire.
now,
i’m
not
going
to
say
that
technically
under
some
definition
of
license
that
this
is
clearly
a
license,
but
this
is
one
of
those
statutes
that’s
worded
in
a
way
in
which
congress
used
every
conceivable
synonym.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
that
could
possibly
think
of
to
indicate
the
breadth.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
but
they’re
not
really
begin
to
recover
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
the
real
costs
of
these
proceedings
and
i
think
the
filing
fee
for
a
certificate
of
compliance
is
$35
which
really
covers
the
mechanics
of
issuance,
the
real
cost
of
the
hearings,
to
maintaining
staff,
in
carefully
reviewing
the
certificates,
and
constantly
monitoring
the
industry.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
and
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
haven’t
thought
about
whether
i
heard
it
before.
i
don’t
have
any
recollection
of
ever
hearing
it.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes
and
there
are
substantial
benefits
let
me
say,
that
accrue
as
a
result
of
the
issuance
of
the
certificates.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
think
it
would
leave
that
up
to
the
local
franchising
authority.
let
me
say
that
one
of
the
reasons
there
isn’t
a
kind
of
monopoly
protection
in
the
sense
that
televisions
get
it
is
because
as
a
practical
matter,
local
catv
system
has
a
natural
monopoly.
that
is,
once
it’s
established
and
has
gone
through
stringing
up
the
wire,
it
generally
has
an
agreement
with
the
telephone
company
for
use
of
the
cables.
it
charges
$5
a
month
and
it
has
its
subscribers
in
the
start
up
course
for
going
into
the
catv
business
that
are
very
substantial.
and
it’s
not
generally
the
fact
that
there
are
more
than
one
catv
system
operating
in
an
individual
area.
nevertheless,
the
commission
has
undertaken
action
to
limit
competition
for
the
benefit
of
the
catv
industry
at
the
request
of
the
catv
industry.
it’s
gotten
telephone
companies
for
example,
out
of
the
catv
business
at
the
request
of
the
catv
industry,
at
the
request
of
this
particular
petitioner
here
who
told
the
court
of
appeals
in
asking
to
intervene
in
support
of
the
commission’s
regulation
that
the
regulation
was
essential
to
the
existence
of
an
independent
catv
industry.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
it
did.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
we’re
not
charging
them
for
putting
them
out
of
business.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
for
an
interim
period,
but
these
petitioners
here
purport
not
to
represent
those
companies.
they’re
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well
no,
they
represent
the
independent
catv
industry.
they
weren’t
representing
the
telephone
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
we
haven’t
raised
any
kind
of
standing
issues,
but
of
course
they
have
standing
to
raise
the
claims
of
their
members.
now,
if
the
telephone
companies
want
to
come
in
here
and
complain
about
the
fee,
i
suppose
they
are
probably
free
to
do
so.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
who
will
be
going
out
of
business,
but
since
they
are
in
business
for
the
years
in
which
they
are
paying
the
fee,
they’re
still
benefiting
from
commission
regulation.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
that’s
correct.
what
we’re
saying
is
that
regulation,
when
you’re
go
into
a
business
that’s
affected
with
a
public
interest
you
have
to
expect
to
be
told
to
do
things
you
don’t
like.
what
we’re
charging
for
in
a
sense
is
for
giving
benefits
that
you
wouldn’t
get,
but
for
the
fact
that
you
were
regulated.
and
they
wouldn’t
be
able
to
get
for
example,
an
order
from
an
agency
of
the
government
putting
the
television
broadcast
industry
out
of
the
catv
business,
getting
newspapers
out
of
the
catv
business,
getting
telephone
companies
out
of
the
catv
business.
it’s
impossible
to
say
that
the
members
of
the
catv
industry
that
this
petitioner
represents
have
not
benefited
substantially
and
do
not
continue
to
benefit
substantially
from
that
kind
of
activity
and
there’s
more.
for
example,
and
this
might
have
some
relevance
with
respect
to
the
telephone
companies,
the
commission’s
rules
with
the
regard
to
franchising
place
a
limit
on
the
fees
that
can
be
charged
by
the
local
municipalities.
that
fee
has
averaged
according
to
one
study,
an
average
of
8%
of
the
gross
receipts.
what
the
commission
has
said
is
you
can’t
charge
that
kind
of
a
fee.
the
only
thing
you
can
charge
is
within
the
guidelines
is
a
fee
between
3%.
if
you
want
to
go
over
that
you
have
to
show
that
it’s
necessary
to
sustain
the
cost
of
regulations
so
that
in
effect
or
the
commission
is
said
as
the
localities
can
only
charge
fees
which
can
reimburse
them
for
regulation.
so
here,
we
have
in
return
for
a
fee
of
one-half
of
1%
of
their
gross
revenues,
where
cutting
down
the
average
that
paid
to
municipalities
and
localities
from
8%
a
year
average
to
something
around
to
3%
to
4%
which
is
a
substantial
benefit,
and
was
done
also
at
the
suggestion
of
the
catv
industry.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
true,
congress
could
have.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
congress
sends
all
of
us
a
bill
for
the
services
that
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
must
say
that
standing
up
here
i
find
it
difficult
to
think
of
a
provision
of
the
constitution
that
it
would
violate.
i
suppose
with
some
more
thought,
i
might
be
able
to
think
of
a
problem
that
would
provide.
that’s
not
the
situation
here.
what
congress
is
here
saying
and
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well
that’s
true,
and
of
course
every
program
undertaken
pursuant
to
any
act
of
congress
is
intended
to
benefit
the
public
generally.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
right,
but
if
you
accept
that
reasoning
and
now
is
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
title
v
means
nothing.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
because
there
isn’t
a
single
program
that
is
enacted
principally
to
serve
the
public
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
right.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
although
there’s
been
substantial
reliance
on
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
on
the
new
england
case,
in
which
the
court
without
really
citing
any
specific
reference
or
scriptures
found
that
it
was
something
fundamentally
wrong
with
charging
a
fee
where
the
purpose
of
the
program
is
to
benefit
the
public.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
would
think
that
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
substantial
benefit
that
accrues
to
the
farmer,
and
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
cost
in
administering
the
program
that
it
probably
could.
i
don’t
know
that
congress
really
enacted
that
legislation
with
that
particular
executive
program
in
mind,
although
it’s
quite
clear
that
they
enacted
title
v
with
the
federal
communications
commission
precisely
in
its
mind
in
recognizing
the
benefits
that
accrue
to
those
who
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
communications
commission
as
a
result
of
the
regulation
which
is
afforded
by
the
commission.
it
was
quite
clear
that
representative
yates
specifically
mentioned
the
federal
communications
commission
as
did
others
because
it’s
the
most
obvious
one
in
which
the
regulated
industries
derives
substantial
benefit
as
a
result
of
the
franchises
and
permits
that
they
get.
now,
there’s
been
some
reference
to
the
regulation
before
1972
and
post
1972.
now,
i
don’t
understand
that
the
petition
challenges
nor
do
i
understand
that
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
really
was
related
only
to
two
years.
the
commission’s
rule
and
fee
applies
in
1970,
71,
72,
73,
74
and
it’s
not
really
relevant
as
we
view
it
what
year
particular
commission
activities
are
undertaken.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
although
we’re
accused
of
going
outside
the
record,
and
improperly
bringing
in
post
1972
activities,
the
petitioner
at
page
23
of
his
brief
states
that
he
was
the
first
one
to
do
it.
he
says
“ncta
recited
to
the
fifth
circuit
the
adverse
effects
of
the
commission
catv
regulation
prior
to,
during,
and
subsequent
to
the
promulgation
of
the
annual
fees
schedule
at
issue
here.”
now,
petitioners
also
challenge
the
method
by
which
the
commission
calculated
the
fees.
now
they
don’t
challenge
per
se
the
concept
of
an
annual
fee.
what
they
seem
to
be
saying
is
that
this
annual
fee
does
not
really
reflect
value
to
the
recipient,
which
is
one
of
the
categories
which
the
commission
must
take
into
account
along
with
the
public
interest
to
be
served,
and
the
amount
of
the
cost
to
the
public
in
furnishing
the
benefit,
that
this
couldn’t
possibly
reflect
value
to
the
recipient
because
in
any
one
year,
a
number
of
catv
industries
don’t
actually
come
to
the
commission
for
anything
specifically.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
argument
ignores
the
fact
that
the
value
to
the
recipient
for
example,
of
a
fcc
rule
or
regulation
does
not
simply
benefit
him
in
the
single
year
that’s
issued.
a
license
is
not
limited
to
the
year
in
which
it’s
issued
and
the
other
substantial
benefits
which
have
arisen,
such
as
the
elimination
of
competition
have
value
which
go
beyond
the
year
that
it’s
issued.
on
the
other
hand,
the
commission
can
operate
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
putting
out
an
act
for
lawyers
every
time
an
application
for
a
certificate
comes
in,
or
anytime
the
ncta
comes
running
to
it
for
help
from
competition
which
it
can’t
cope
with
on
its
own.
full
time
staff
is
required
to
develop
the
expertise
necessary,
and
to
be
available
to
those
who
come
to
it
for
assistance.
and
so
that
the
mere
fact
that
in
any
given
year,
a
catv
company
doesn’t
come
to
the
commission
for
anything,
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
commission
has
failed
to
take
into
account
value
to
the
recipient
in
formulating
an
annual
fee.
moreover,
since
the
entire
industry
benefits
from
that
regulation,
and
since
it’s
clear
for
example,
and
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
disputed
that
the
commission
could
calculate
one
filing
fee
which
would
really
be
substantial
not
$35
and
charge
it
as
against
one
company.
what
the
commission
has
done
here
is
it's
decided
it
would
be
more
equitable
to
spread
the
cost
a
bit,
particularly
for
smaller
catv
companies
by
making
the
amount
contingent
on
gross
revenues,
which
reflects
more
equitably
the
real
value
that
is
derived
from
engaging
in
this
particular
business.
and
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously
affirmed
the
commission’s
determination
that
these
fees
were
fair
and
equitable,
and
as
we
view
it,
that
simply
almost
a
discretionary
determination
which
even
before
the
court
of
appeals
the
commission’s
evaluation
was
entitled
to
great
weight.
and
for
these
reasons,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
department
of
justice
appears
here
today
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
and
the
federal
communications
commission
to
urge
affirmance
of
the
unanimous
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
which
sustained
the
federal
communications
commission’s
construction
of
an
act
of
congress
title
v
of
the
independent
offices
appropriations
act
of
1952.
the
issue
presented
here
is
whether
the
activities
undertaken
by
the
commission
with
regard
to
the
catv
industry,
come
within
the
categories
prescribed
in
title
v
of
the
act,
and
therefore,
compelled
the
commission
to
impose
an
annual
fee
of
30
cents
per
subscriber
per
month
to
be
paid
by
each
catv
system
in
order
to
reimburse
the
taxpayers
of
the
united
states
for
the
costs
incurred
in
sustaining
these
activities.
these
costs
exceeded
$1
million
in
1970-71,
and
will
exceed
$3
million
in
the
coming
fiscal
year.
the
amount
of
the
fee
as
calculated
initially
came
to
something
in
the
neighborhood
of
one-half
of
1%
of
the
gross
revenues
of
the
catv
industry.
a
number
of
cases
involving
the
catv
industry
have
come
before
this
court
in
recent
years,
and
there
is
really
little
need
to
discuss
here
the
nature
of
that
industry
where
its
phenomenal
growth
into
a
$500
million
a
year
business,
serving
some
seven
million
subscribers.
now,
$500
million
a
year
figure
is
almost
doubled
that
of
only
four
years
ago.
essentially,
as
the
chief
justice
stated
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
midwest
video
case,
catv
systems
exploit
existing
broadcast
signals
to
which
they
make
no
contribution
by
plucking
them
from
the
air,
and
transmitting
them
over
cables,
generally
strung
over
telephone
poles
to
subscribers
who
are
hooked
in
to
the
system,
and
who
pay
generally
speaking
a
monthly
fee
in
the
neighborhood
of
$5
to
$6
a
month.
now,
the
implications
of
such
a
rapidly
growing
system
through
the
carriage
of
broadcast
signals
place
the
catv’s
activities
clearly
within
the
ambit
of
the
regulatory
jurisdiction
of
the
commission,
which
is
charged
by
congress
in
section
151
of
title
47
to
make
available
to
all
the
people
of
the
united
states,
a
rapid,
efficient,
nationwide,
and
worldwide
radio
communication
service
with
adequate
facilities
at
reasonable
charges.
petitioner
here
charges
--
challenges
the
annual
fees
imposed
by
the
commission
on
several
grounds,
and
before
getting
into
them,
i
would
like
to
speak
for
a
moment
to
the
bureau
of
the
budget
circular
that
has
been
referred
to
by
petitioner.
first,
that
is
not
and
does
not
purport
to
be
“an
interpretation”
of
title
v.
it
simply
is
what
it
says
it
is,
namely
some
general
policies
for
developing
an
equitable
and
uniform
system
of
charges.
the
bureau
of
the
budget
circular
was
adopted
pursuant
to
the
statement
in
title
v
of
the
act
which
says
that
in
cases
--
in
the
case
of
agencies
in
the
executive
branch,
the
fee
shall
be
uniform
as
practicable
subject
to
policies,
such
policies
as
the
president
may
prescribe
for
agencies
in
the
executive
branch
which
the
federal
communications
commission
clearly
is
not.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
bureau
of
circular
itself
is
addressed
to
heads
of
executive
agencies
and
establishments.
moreover,
it’s
quite
true
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
that
the
bureau
of
the
budget
does
have
extensive
leverage
which
it
can
use
even
with
respect
to
an
independent
regulatory
agency,
but
it
should
also
be
pointed
out
that
the
bureau
of
the
budget
is
fully
aware
of
what
the
communications
commission
has
done
every
year.
it’s
been
advised
that
the
end
of
every
year
precisely
what
the
commission
is
doing.
indeed
it
was
at
the
urging
in
part
of
the
bureau
of
the
budget,
now
the
office
of
management
budget,
that
the
commission
acted
to
substantially
increase
its
fees
schedule
so
that
the
commission
is
not
bound
by
the
particular
language
of
the
budget
bureau
circular.
if
it
was
bound
by
it,
it
would
seem
that
the
determination
of
the
executive
branch
which
i
represent
here
as
well,
that
the
commission
has
complied
with
those
guidelines,
should
be
sufficient.
this
is
not
a
regulation,
it
doesn’t
have
the
force
and
effect
of
statute,
it’s
merely
policy
guidelines.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
the
address
of
the
notice
as
it
appears
in
the
appendix
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
it
may
very
well
have
been,
i’m
not
certain
of
that.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i’m
not
certain
of
whether
they
were
actually
on
the
mailing
list.
i
would
think
that
they’d
probably
should
be,
even
though
they’re
not
technically
bound
simply
because
it’s
not
a
bad
idea
for
them
to
try
and
formulate
their
policies
consistently
with
other
agencies
of
the
executive
branch
if
they
feel
they
can
do
so
consistent
with
their
obligations
under
the
statute.
i
mean
we’re
not
and
the
commission
of
course
looked
at
these
guidelines
and
attempted
to
follow
them,
and
we
believe
they
have
been
formulating
the
annual
fee.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct,
but
nevertheless
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
correct,
but
nevertheless,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
i’m
not
suggesting
that
it
would
be
undesirable.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
think
it’s
generally
it’s
a
good
thing
to
have
a
uniform
set
of
schedules.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no
i
mean,
the
federal
communications
commission
as
far
as
the
general
public
is
concerned,
and
as
far
as
the
industry
is
subject
to
regulation,
it’s
a
small
matter
to
them
whether
technically
the
federal
communications
commission
is
viewed
as
part
of
the
executive
branch,
or
whether
it's
viewed
as
a
creature
of
congress
and
an
independent
regulatory
agency.
and
it
would
seem
desirable
that
where
you
have,
at
least
in
the
eyes
of
the
public,
a
view
that
it's
simply
part
of
the
government,
that
agencies
which
appear
to
be
part
of
the
government
act
in
a
matter
that’s
consistent,
provided
that
the
particular
agency
feels
that
it
can
act
that
way
and
still
adhere
to
the
mandate
which
congress
has
given
it.
now,
petitioner
challenges
the
annual
fee
on
two
grounds.
first
it
contends
--
let
me
say
one
more
thing,
we’re
not
suggesting
that
we’re
in
anyway
conceding
that
we
haven’t
complied
with
this
bureau
of
the
budget
circular.
i
just
want
to
put
our
position
in
proper
perspective,
in
that
many
of
the
words
and
standards
that
have
been
suggested
by
the
petitioners
applying
here,
words
like
identifiable,
beneficiary,
measurable
unit
of
government
service,
all
of
those
things
do
not
appear
on
the
statute.
and
as
petitioner
conceded
in
response
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question,
the
question
presented
here
and
as
presented
in
the
first
question
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
turns
on
the
construction
of
the
act,
and
not
the
bureau
of
the
budget
circular.
now,
first
it’s
petitioner’s
contention
that
the
commission’s
function
is
to
serve
the
public
interest
and
that
they
do
not
receive
any
benefits
from
regulation.
indeed
they
claim
that
the
overall
effect
of
the
commission's
regulation
has
affirmatively
hindered
their
economic
growth.
second,
they
claim
that
even
if
the
catv
industry
does
receive
benefits,
the
commission
erred
in
the
manner
in
which
it
applied
the
criteria
in
title
v
in
calculating
the
fee.
we
submit
that
both
of
these
claims
were
properly
rejected
by
the
court
of
appeals.
first,
with
respect
to
the
petitioner’s
initial
claim,
we
believe
that
the
issue
here
does
not
depend
on
whether
the
catv
industry
as
a
whole
benefited
or
was
harmed
because
or
as
a
result
of
commission
regulation.
it
seems
to
us
that
everyone
who
enters
a
business
which
is
effective
with
the
public
interest
must
of
necessity
expect
to
be
regulated.
and
regulation
means
being
told
to
do
things
that
you
don’t
like
as
well
as
things
that
you
would
like
to
undertake.
they
must
expect
to
be
told
that
all
of
their
activities
must
be
conducted
in
a
manner
subordinate
for
the
public
interest
whether
they
like
it
or
not.
yet
the
language
of
title
v
clearly
suggests
that
those
subject
to
regulation
pay
the
costs
of
that
regulation
in
at
least
several
instances
which
are
relevant
to
this
particular
case.
this
is
clearly
surely
shown
by
the
references
to
charges
for
the
cost
of
issuing
licenses,
permits,
certificates,
or
similar
things
of
value.
now,
the
only
reason
when
these
are
licensed
to
do
anything
is
because
there’s
a
regulatory
program
which
requires
you
to
get
the
license,
and
yet
congress
said
that
to
the
fullest
extent
possible,
the
agency
should
recover
the
cost
of
issuing
that
license,
permit,
certificate,
or
other
thing
of
value.
moreover,
it
is
equally
clear
that
congress
intended
that
regulatory
agencies
not
only
be
reimbursed
“to
the
fullest
extent
possible”
for
the
cost
of
issuing
these
license,
but
that
they
also
recover
costs
incurred
in
activities
which
confer
benefits
which
are
special,
that
is
benefits
which
the
regulated
industry
would
not
receive,
but
for
the
fact
that
they
were
being
regulated
by
the
commission.
and
it’s
our
submission
that
the
commission’s
regulation
of
the
catv
industry
implicates
both
aspects
of
this
act.
in
the
first
place,
since
1972,
commission
regulations
have
required
all
catv
stations
to
obtain
certificates
of
compliance.
that
is
the
commission
has
adopted
regulations
with
respect
to
the
franchising
of
catv
stations
which
divide
responsibility
between
the
local
community
and
the
federal
communications
commission.
essentially
what
the
commission
does
is
set
out
broad
guidelines
which
have
to
be
followed
by
the
local
agency,
local
authority
in
issuing
its
certificates.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
in
the
sense
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
it
couldn’t
operate
without
it.
no
i
don’t
know
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
the
statute
uses
words
which
are
not
limited
to
license.
it
says
license,
certificate,
permit,
or
other
things
of
value.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
it
certainly
not
the
same
as
the
broadcast
license.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well
it’s
not.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
it’s
called
the
certificate
of
compliance
without
which
they
couldn’t
engage
in
this
activity.
now
whether
that
comes
within
a
dictionary
definition
of
a
license,
it
certainly
equivalent
of
it,
and
i
think
the
language
of
the
statute
is
so
worded
as
to
indicate
that
congress
intended
that
that
ought
to
be
covered.
without
it
they
couldn’t
operate.
of
course
without
in
a
sense
there’s
a
joint
franchising
authority
here
because
without
local
authority
of
the
fcc,
the
catv
station
couldn’t
string
up
its
cables.
but
all
that
authority
is
to
string
up
its
cables.
they
still
have
to
get
the
commission’s
approval
to
carry
the
signals
over
the
wire.
now,
i’m
not
going
to
say
that
technically
under
some
definition
of
license
that
this
is
clearly
a
license,
but
this
is
one
of
those
statutes
that’s
worded
in
a
way
in
which
congress
used
every
conceivable
synonym.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
that
could
possibly
think
of
to
indicate
the
breadth.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
but
they’re
not
really
begin
to
recover
to
the
fullest
extent
possible
the
real
costs
of
these
proceedings
and
i
think
the
filing
fee
for
a
certificate
of
compliance
is
$35
which
really
covers
the
mechanics
of
issuance,
the
real
cost
of
the
hearings,
to
maintaining
staff,
in
carefully
reviewing
the
certificates,
and
constantly
monitoring
the
industry.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
and
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
haven’t
thought
about
whether
i
heard
it
before.
i
don’t
have
any
recollection
of
ever
hearing
it.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes
and
there
are
substantial
benefits
let
me
say,
that
accrue
as
a
result
of
the
issuance
of
the
certificates.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
think
it
would
leave
that
up
to
the
local
franchising
authority.
let
me
say
that
one
of
the
reasons
there
isn’t
a
kind
of
monopoly
protection
in
the
sense
that
televisions
get
it
is
because
as
a
practical
matter,
local
catv
system
has
a
natural
monopoly.
that
is,
once
it’s
established
and
has
gone
through
stringing
up
the
wire,
it
generally
has
an
agreement
with
the
telephone
company
for
use
of
the
cables.
it
charges
$5
a
month
and
it
has
its
subscribers
in
the
start
up
course
for
going
into
the
catv
business
that
are
very
substantial.
and
it’s
not
generally
the
fact
that
there
are
more
than
one
catv
system
operating
in
an
individual
area.
nevertheless,
the
commission
has
undertaken
action
to
limit
competition
for
the
benefit
of
the
catv
industry
at
the
request
of
the
catv
industry.
it’s
gotten
telephone
companies
for
example,
out
of
the
catv
business
at
the
request
of
the
catv
industry,
at
the
request
of
this
particular
petitioner
here
who
told
the
court
of
appeals
in
asking
to
intervene
in
support
of
the
commission’s
regulation
that
the
regulation
was
essential
to
the
existence
of
an
independent
catv
industry.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes,
it
did.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
no,
we’re
not
charging
them
for
putting
them
out
of
business.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
for
an
interim
period,
but
these
petitioners
here
purport
not
to
represent
those
companies.
they’re
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well
no,
they
represent
the
independent
catv
industry.
they
weren’t
representing
the
telephone
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
we
haven’t
raised
any
kind
of
standing
issues,
but
of
course
they
have
standing
to
raise
the
claims
of
their
members.
now,
if
the
telephone
companies
want
to
come
in
here
and
complain
about
the
fee,
i
suppose
they
are
probably
free
to
do
so.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
yes.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
who
will
be
going
out
of
business,
but
since
they
are
in
business
for
the
years
in
which
they
are
paying
the
fee,
they’re
still
benefiting
from
commission
regulation.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
that’s
correct.
what
we’re
saying
is
that
regulation,
when
you’re
go
into
a
business
that’s
affected
with
a
public
interest
you
have
to
expect
to
be
told
to
do
things
you
don’t
like.
what
we’re
charging
for
in
a
sense
is
for
giving
benefits
that
you
wouldn’t
get,
but
for
the
fact
that
you
were
regulated.
and
they
wouldn’t
be
able
to
get
for
example,
an
order
from
an
agency
of
the
government
putting
the
television
broadcast
industry
out
of
the
catv
business,
getting
newspapers
out
of
the
catv
business,
getting
telephone
companies
out
of
the
catv
business.
it’s
impossible
to
say
that
the
members
of
the
catv
industry
that
this
petitioner
represents
have
not
benefited
substantially
and
do
not
continue
to
benefit
substantially
from
that
kind
of
activity
and
there’s
more.
for
example,
and
this
might
have
some
relevance
with
respect
to
the
telephone
companies,
the
commission’s
rules
with
the
regard
to
franchising
place
a
limit
on
the
fees
that
can
be
charged
by
the
local
municipalities.
that
fee
has
averaged
according
to
one
study,
an
average
of
8%
of
the
gross
receipts.
what
the
commission
has
said
is
you
can’t
charge
that
kind
of
a
fee.
the
only
thing
you
can
charge
is
within
the
guidelines
is
a
fee
between
3%.
if
you
want
to
go
over
that
you
have
to
show
that
it’s
necessary
to
sustain
the
cost
of
regulations
so
that
in
effect
or
the
commission
is
said
as
the
localities
can
only
charge
fees
which
can
reimburse
them
for
regulation.
so
here,
we
have
in
return
for
a
fee
of
one-half
of
1%
of
their
gross
revenues,
where
cutting
down
the
average
that
paid
to
municipalities
and
localities
from
8%
a
year
average
to
something
around
to
3%
to
4%
which
is
a
substantial
benefit,
and
was
done
also
at
the
suggestion
of
the
catv
industry.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
true,
congress
could
have.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
congress
sends
all
of
us
a
bill
for
the
services
that
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
i
must
say
that
standing
up
here
i
find
it
difficult
to
think
of
a
provision
of
the
constitution
that
it
would
violate.
i
suppose
with
some
more
thought,
i
might
be
able
to
think
of
a
problem
that
would
provide.
that’s
not
the
situation
here.
what
congress
is
here
saying
and
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well
that’s
true,
and
of
course
every
program
undertaken
pursuant
to
any
act
of
congress
is
intended
to
benefit
the
public
generally.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
right,
but
if
you
accept
that
reasoning
and
now
is
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
title
v
means
nothing.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
because
there
isn’t
a
single
program
that
is
enacted
principally
to
serve
the
public
--
mr.
edward
r.
korman
that’s
right.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
although
there’s
been
substantial
reliance
on
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
on
the
new
england
case,
in
which
the
court
without
really
citing
any
specific
reference
or
scriptures
found
that
it
was
something
fundamentally
wrong
with
charging
a
fee
where
the
purpose
of
the
program
is
to
benefit
the
public.
mr.
edward
r.
korman
well,
i
would
think
that
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
substantial
benefit
that
accrues
to
the
farmer,
and
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
cost
in
administering
the
program
that
it
probably
could.
i
don’t
know
that
congress
really
enacted
that
legislation
with
that
particular
executive
program
in
mind,
although
it’s
quite
clear
that
they
enacted
title
v
with
the
federal
communications
commission
precisely
in
its
mind
in
recognizing
the
benefits
that
accrue
to
those
who
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
communications
commission
as
a
result
of
the
regulation
which
is
afforded
by
the
commission.
it
was
quite
clear
that
representative
yates
specifically
mentioned
the
federal
communications
commission
as
did
others
because
it’s
the
most
obvious
one
in
which
the
regulated
industries
derives
substantial
benefit
as
a
result
of
the
franchises
and
permits
that
they
get.
now,
there’s
been
some
reference
to
the
regulation
before
1972
and
post
1972.
now,
i
don’t
understand
that
the
petition
challenges
nor
do
i
understand
that
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
really
was
related
only
to
two
years.
the
commission’s
rule
and
fee
applies
in
1970,
71,
72,
73,
74
and
it’s
not
really
relevant
as
we
view
it
what
year
particular
commission
activities
are
undertaken.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
although
we’re
accused
of
going
outside
the
record,
and
improperly
bringing
in
post
1972
activities,
the
petitioner
at
page
23
of
his
brief
states
that
he
was
the
first
one
to
do
it.
he
says
“ncta
recited
to
the
fifth
circuit
the
adverse
effects
of
the
commission
catv
regulation
prior
to,
during,
and
subsequent
to
the
promulgation
of
the
annual
fees
schedule
at
issue
here.”
now,
petitioners
also
challenge
the
method
by
which
the
commission
calculated
the
fees.
now
they
don’t
challenge
per
se
the
concept
of
an
annual
fee.
what
they
seem
to
be
saying
is
that
this
annual
fee
does
not
really
reflect
value
to
the
recipient,
which
is
one
of
the
categories
which
the
commission
must
take
into
account
along
with
the
public
interest
to
be
served,
and
the
amount
of
the
cost
to
the
public
in
furnishing
the
benefit,
that
this
couldn’t
possibly
reflect
value
to
the
recipient
because
in
any
one
year,
a
number
of
catv
industries
don’t
actually
come
to
the
commission
for
anything
specifically.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
this
argument
ignores
the
fact
that
the
value
to
the
recipient
for
example,
of
a
fcc
rule
or
regulation
does
not
simply
benefit
him
in
the
single
year
that’s
issued.
a
license
is
not
limited
to
the
year
in
which
it’s
issued
and
the
other
substantial
benefits
which
have
arisen,
such
as
the
elimination
of
competition
have
value
which
go
beyond
the
year
that
it’s
issued.
on
the
other
hand,
the
commission
can
operate
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
putting
out
an
act
for
lawyers
every
time
an
application
for
a
certificate
comes
in,
or
anytime
the
ncta
comes
running
to
it
for
help
from
competition
which
it
can’t
cope
with
on
its
own.
full
time
staff
is
required
to
develop
the
expertise
necessary,
and
to
be
available
to
those
who
come
to
it
for
assistance.
and
so
that
the
mere
fact
that
in
any
given
year,
a
catv
company
doesn’t
come
to
the
commission
for
anything,
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
the
commission
has
failed
to
take
into
account
value
to
the
recipient
in
formulating
an
annual
fee.
moreover,
since
the
entire
industry
benefits
from
that
regulation,
and
since
it’s
clear
for
example,
and
i
don’t
think
it
would
be
disputed
that
the
commission
could
calculate
one
filing
fee
which
would
really
be
substantial
not
$35
and
charge
it
as
against
one
company.
what
the
commission
has
done
here
is
it's
decided
it
would
be
more
equitable
to
spread
the
cost
a
bit,
particularly
for
smaller
catv
companies
by
making
the
amount
contingent
on
gross
revenues,
which
reflects
more
equitably
the
real
value
that
is
derived
from
engaging
in
this
particular
business.
and
the
court
of
appeals
unanimously
affirmed
the
commission’s
determination
that
these
fees
were
fair
and
equitable,
and
as
we
view
it,
that
simply
almost
a
discretionary
determination
which
even
before
the
court
of
appeals
the
commission’s
evaluation
was
entitled
to
great
weight.
and
for
these
reasons,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
