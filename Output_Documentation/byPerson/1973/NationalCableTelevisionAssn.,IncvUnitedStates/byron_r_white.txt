let’s
assume
the
federal
communications
commission
wrote
back
to
the
budget
bureau
and
said
that
“your
construction
of
the
act
is
very
interesting,
but
we
have
a
different
view
and
we
prefer
our
own
view.”
the
bureau
of
the
budget
has
no
direct
authority
under
the
commission,
i
guess,
has
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
understand
that,
how
about
my
question?
could
it
to
say,
you
wouldn’t
approve
of
this
particular
type
of
fee
apparently,
but
we
think
it’s
fully
consistent
with
the
act
and
we’re
going
to
follow
it.
there’s
nothing
that
the
bureau
of
the
budget
can
do
about
it,
is
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
where
are
you
reading
now?

but,
even
so,
i
don’t
suppose
the
bureau
of
the
budget
would
itself
--
i
don’t
believe
to
say
it
would
have
to
be
authorized
by
the
act
inconsistently?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
still
have
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
commission
must
observe
the
circular,
or
whether
its
regulation
should
be
judged
not
under
the
circular,
but
under
the
statute,
exactly
under
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume
for
a
moment
that
there
never
had
been
a
circular?
