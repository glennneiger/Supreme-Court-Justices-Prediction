mr.
feldstein,
do
you
think
that
the
bureau
of
the
budget
circular
covers
the
federal
communications
commission?
justice
william

rehnquist
mr.
feldstein,
that
part
you’re
reading
from
there
on
page
151
as
the
policies
as
a
president
may
prescribe
is
preceded
by
the
language
which
in
case
of
agencies
in
the
executive
branch
shall
be
as
uniform
as
practicable
and
subject
to
such
policies
as
the
president
may
subscribe.
doesn’t
that
suggest
that
that
is
perhaps
a
more
limited
category
of
agencies
than
would
be
covered
by
the
act
itself?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
korman,
would
the
commission
turn
down
an
application
from
a
proposed
catv
applicant
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
he
duplicated
the
area
covered
by
someone
already
having
a
certificate,
or
would
it
leave
that
up
to
the
local
franchiser
decision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
korman,
how
far
do
you
carry
your
line
of
argument?
can
a
department
of
agriculture
if
it
raises
crop
support
prices,
bill
the
farmers
for
the
increased
benefit
they
get
from
the
added
crop
support
pricing?
