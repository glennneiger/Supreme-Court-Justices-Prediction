mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
this
morning
arises
from
an
appeal
from
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals’
opinion
upholding
the
fee
schedule
of
the
federal
communications
commission
as
it
applies
to
the
catv
industry,
and
in
particular,
that
portion
of
the
fee
schedule
which
is
related
to
annual
fees
on
a
per
subscriber
basis.
in
general,
the
facts
are
as
follows.
in
1952,
as
a
writer
to
the
appropriations
act,
title
v
was
appended.
this
title
gives
the
federal
communications
commission
and
all
other
so
situated
agencies
the
power
to
enact
fees
to
collect
some
of
the
cost
of
regulation
which
they
incur.
as
a
part
of
this
act,
the
budget
bureau
under
the
president’s
office
was
directed
to
perpetrate
some
kinds
of
standards
for
the
collection
of
the
fees.
the
operative
document
in
this
case,
which
is
appended
in
the
appendix,
is
budget
bureau
circular
a-25,
which
was
last
amended
in
1959
so
that
is
the
circular
we
are
working
with
under
these
fees.
under
these
two
pieces
of
authority,
in
1963,
the
federal
communications
commission
first
enacted
fees.
these
fees
were
enacted
in
docket
14-507
and
they
were
based
on
applications
for
licenses
and
other
kinds
of
filings
made
in
front
of
the
fcc.
these
fees
collected
approximately
25%
of
the
budget
of
the
federal
communications
commission.
there
were
appeals
from
these
fees
incidentally
did
not
apply
to
the
catv
industry,
because
catv
was
not
at
that
time
regulated
by
the
federal
communications
commission.
in
the
seventh
circuit,
in
a
case
called
aeronautical
radio,
inc.
v.
u.s.
and
later
this
supreme
court
affirmed
the
fcc’s
fees,
and
in
so
doing
stated
that
title
v
of
the
1952
appropriations
act
enabled
the
fcc
to
collect
these
filing
fess.
in
1970,
the
commission
decided
to
revise
its
fee
schedule.
so
they
filed
in
february
of
1970
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking.
this
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
proposed
to
do
three
or
four
things.
it
proposed
to
raise
the
filing
fees,
it
proposed
to
add
catv
for
the
first
time,
including
filing
fees,
since
they
had
now
taken
jurisdiction
over
catv
as
far
back
as
1965
and
1966,
and
annual
fees
were
added.
in
particular
for
catv,
the
annual
fees
were
to
collect
some
90%
to
95%
of
the
fees
which
the
fcc
decided
it
wished
to
collect
from
the
catv
industry.
these
annual
fees
which
were
adopted
later
in
1970
were
done
on
a
per
subscriber
basis,
30
cents
per
subscriber.
a
catv
system
obtains
the
vast
bulk
of
its
revenue
from
subscribing
homes
which
it
hooks
up
to
its
system,
and
it
is
usually
expressed
--
the
size
of
a
system
is
expressed
in
the
number
of
subscribers.
the
fcc
therefore,
stated
its
annual
fee
on
a
basis
of
per
subscriber
fee,
thus
30
cents.
parenthetically,
as
is
noted
in
our
brief,
the
1972
still
outstanding
rulemaking
proposes
to
raise
these
fees
from
30
cents
per
subscriber
to
40
cents.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
yes,
the
activity
costs
are
on
page
31
of
the
appendix,
and
it
gives
the
cost
as
$1,145,400
or
4.6%
of
the
fcc’s
budget.
now,
these
costs
incidentally
are
both
direct
costs
of
the
cable
bureau
and
attributable
costs
such
things
as
the
field
engineering
bureau
and
the
commissioner’s
offices
which
cannot
be
attributed
a
lock,
stock,
and
barrel
to
one
activity,
but
are
spread
as
a
percentage
across.
so
you
have
direct
cost
and
then
you
have
indirect
cost.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
i
would
presume
so,
yes.
several
parties
appealed
the
commission’s
report
and
order
of
july
1970
and
the
first
appeal
was
filed
in
the
fifth
circuit
so
all
appeals
were
transferred
there.
and
in
the
clay
case,
which
is
the
decision
before
you,
in
1972
the
fcc
was
upheld
in
all
particulars.
the
catv
industry’s
appeal
was
based
on
the
annual
fee,
and
the
allegations
were
that
the
annual
fee
was
not
related
to
the
statutory
criteria
of
the
appropriations
act
and
had
misapplied
the
criteria
stated
in
budget
bureau
circular
a-25.
now,
in
more
detail,
the
authority
to
collect
fees
comes
from
title
v,
and
this
is
reprinted
on
page
151
of
the
appendix.
and
in
that
section,
they
state
that
congress
--
it
is
the
sense
of
the
congress
that
any
and
it
lists
several
things,
these
types
of
activities
are
done
by
an
agency,
shall
be
self-sustaining
to
the
full
extent
possible.
and
then
it
states
subject
to
such
policies
as
the
president
may
prescribe,
which
is
the
authority
for
budget
bureau
circular
a-25.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
about
two-thirds
of
the
way
down
that
statute,
and
these
are
the
operative
criteria;
that
the
fees
must
be
fair
and
equitable
taking
into
consideration
(1)
direct
and
indirect
cost
to
the
government,
(2)
value
to
the
recipient,
(3)
public
policy
or
interest
served,
and
(4)
other
pertinent
facts.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
that
is
correct.
the
companion
case
has
some
arguments
about
stuff
in
the
federal
power
commission
act,
but
there
is
no
authority
in
the
federal
communications
act
with
one
small
example,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
catv,
so
we
are
discussing
this
particular
statute.
budget
bureau
circular
a-25
which
begins
on
page
142
of
the
appendix
interprets
this
statute
and
lays
out
for
the
federal
agencies
how
they
are
to
go
about
setting
fees.
the
first
important
statement
is
on
page
142
of
the
appendix
under
section
2
coverage,
where
it
states
in
the
second
line,
“the
provisions
of
this
circular
cover
all
federal
activities
which
convey
special
benefits
to
recipients
above
and
beyond
those
accruing
to
the
public
at
large.”
then
on
page
143,
all
of
section
3
(a)
states
the
criteria.
the
most
important
of
which
are
set
out
right
in
the
top
of
the
page
where
it
states
under
general
policy,
a
reasonable
charge,
as
described
below,
should
be
made
to
(1)
each
identifiable
recipient,
(2)
for
a
measurable
unit
or
amount
of
government
service
or
property
from
which
(3)
derives
a
special
benefit.
so
the
identifiable
recipient,
measurable
unit
of
service,
and
special
benefit
criteria
are
what
i
believe,
i
submit,
that
we
should
be
looking
for
in
the
promulgation
of
these
fcc
fees.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
i
do,
yes
sir.
the
assumption
has
been
made
that
it
did.
this
question
was
not
handled
in
the
court
below,
and
the
congress
and
the
hearings
which
is
cited
by
the
government
in
1969
which
urged
the
agencies
to
go
forward,
were
urging
the
commission
to
go
forward
under
this,
and
the
federal
communications
commission
was
one
of
the
examples
that
were
used
in
the
original
legislative
history.
now,
under
special
services
on
page
143
of
the
appendix,
several
things
are
listed.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
no,
but
in
the
process
of
budgets,
and
the
process
of
promulgating
forms,
in
the
process
of
many
things
that
the
commission
does,
you
must
go
through
the
bureau
of
the
budget.
for
example,
when
the
commission
--
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
i
think
that
the
act
states
that
you
must
follow
the
criteria
that
are
set
down
by
the
president,
thus
the
act
states
that
subject
to
such
policies
as
the
president
may
prescribe.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
i’m
reading
in
the
middle
of
the
title
v
which
is
found
on
155
of
the
appendix.
and
it’s
pursuant
to
this
phrase
that
budget
bureau
circular
a-25
was
promulgated
by
the
president’s
bureau
of
the
budget.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
that’s
correct.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
the
government
i
believe,
has
suggested
this
in
one
paragraph
in
its
brief,
but
i
believe
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
substantiates
the
view
that
it
was
intended
that
such
guidelines
would
be
set
down
for
all
agencies
which
were
both
congressional
and
executive
departments.
and
as
such,
the
guidelines
in
budget
bureau
a-25
have
the
agencies
that
have
promulgated
fees
have
attempted
to
follow
these
no
matter
which
category
they
have
been
in.
and
this
was
the
area
which
was
looked
at
in
fact
by
the
courts
in
the
aeronautical
radio
case.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
yes,
thus
when
the
commission
goes
to
the
bureau
of
the
budget
with
its
budget,
difficulties
which
omb
has
are
hammered
out.
thus,
the
commission’s
budget
maybe
decreased
or
increased
by
the
bureau
of
the
budget
before
it
ever
sees
the
appropriate
appropriations
committee
in
congress.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
that
is
correct.
the
criteria
in
the
budget
bureau
circular
are
then
followed
on
page
143
of
the
appendix,
by
a
listing
of
the
kinds
of
special
services
for
which
fees
are
authorized
to
be
collected.
thus,
in
1
(a),
(b),
and
(c)
there
are
examples,
receiving
patents,
craft
insurance,
license
to
carry
on
a
specific
business,
certificates
of
necessity
and
convenience,
in
(b)
safety
inspections
of
craft,
etcetera.
we
submit
that
the
common
thread
in
all
of
these
examples
is
that
a
particular
identifiable
entity
has
received
in
identifiable
benefit.
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
i
believe
bears
this
out.
thus,
in
the
senate
reports
which
are
quoted
at
some
length
on
pages
22
through
26
of
the
ncta
reply
brief,
you
will
find
language
to
that
effect,
likewise,
the
sole
floor
comments,
since
there
was
limited
floor
debate
on
that
by
representative
yates
printed
on
page
25
and
26
of
our
reply
brief,
talk
about
portion,
getting
fees
back
for
a
portion
of
the
operations.
it
talks
about
applications
for
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
being
paid
for
by
the
person
who
applied
for
it.
so
that
it
is
our
feeling
that
the
legislative
history
supports
the
interpretation
of
the
act,
which
we
are
giving
and
which
we
feel
that
the
budget
bureau
gave
in
circular
a-25.
now,
in
aeronautical
radio
what
was
before
that
court,
the
supreme
court
and
the
seventh
circuit
were
the
questions
under
specific
filing
fees,
and
unless
there
be
any
doubt
of
that,
on
page
33
of
ncta’s
opening
brief,
we
quoted
from
the
commission’s
report
and
order
at
that
time
where
the
commission
was
adopting
filing
fees
and
stated
that
they
were
obtaining
to
the
full
extent
possible
fees
for
services
which
bestow
special
privileges
and
services
upon
certain
individuals
who
may
apply
for
those
privileges
and
services.
so
certainly
what
the
commission,
the
fcc
was
doing
at
that
time
was
decidedly
limited
to
the
voluntary
filing
for
special
privileges.
then,
in
the
new
england
power
case,
which
is
the
companion
case
to
this
one,
the
court
there
was
faced
with
a
similar
interpretation
as
to
what
the
fcc
is
attempting
to
ask
this
court
to
interpret
the
budget
bureau
circular
and
the
statute
as,
and
in
that
case
it
was
rejected
and
i
will
get
into
that
one
a
bit
more.
these
then
are
the
authorities
which
are
prevailing
for
the
justification
of
the
fcc’s
fees,
and
the
limits
that
we
feel
are
placed
on
them.
now,
going
down
in
the
argument,
the
criteria
in
terms
of
special
benefit,
we
have
argued
in
our
brief,
and
the
government
has
argued
back
and
forth
as
to
whether
the
fcc’s
regulation
of
catv
is
provided
in
these
special
benefits
to
the
catv
industry.
it
is
our
allegation
that
the
fcc’s
regulation
has
been
bad
for
our
industry.
that
it
has
had
a
very
deleterious
effect
and
that
in
fact
in
the
years
under
review
here
from
1968
to
1972
which
cover
all
of
the
years
of
the
fees
that
are
under
review
today,
there
was
in
fact
a
freeze
on
catv
growth.
up
until
1966
or
65
rather,
there
was
a
rather
unlimited
growth
on
catv,
it
was
limited
by
its
own
constraints
and
limited
by
a
local
law,
but
not
by
the
fcc.
starting
in
1965,
the
fcc
begun
to
regulate
quite
heavily
and
their
1966
second
report
and
order,
which
was
reviewed
by
this
court
in
u.s.
v.
southwestern.
that
particular
report
and
order
did
not
work
out
well,
and
there
is
plenty
of
documentation
to
that
effect
in
the
briefs,
and
in
the
fcc’s
own
reports
and
orders,
and
notice
of
proposed
--
rulemaking
proposing
to
change
their
rules.
in
december
of
1968,
all
growth
of
catv
in
their
larger
markets
was
frozen.
several
attempts
to
unfreeze
this
situation
went
for
naught,
and
finally
in
february
of
1972.
long
after
the
fees
in
question
were
enacted,
and
long
after
the
appeal
from
the
fee
schedule
was
taken,
the
fcc
adopted
some
new
rules
in
1972.
the
fcc
has
attempted
to
bring
these
1972
rules
into
play
in
this
case.
i
very
strongly
submit
that
whatever
the
1972
rules
do
or
did
not
do
for
the
catv
industry,
they
were
not
the
rules
and
not
the
regulations
which
were
in
effect
at
the
time
that
these
fees
were
promulgated,
nor
were
they
in
effect
for
the
two-and-a-half
years
in
which
these
fees
were
collected,
and
that
which
covers
the
period
from
the
promulgation
of
the
fees
in
1970
until
the
new
rules
in
1972.
now
the
commission
has
stated
that
even
in
1970
at
the
time
these
fees
were
promulgated,
there
was
much
to
say
for
the
fcc’s
regulation
that
would
give
a
special
benefit
to
the
catv
industry.
thus,
they
state
that
we
had
to
have
authorization,
or
permission,
or
they
could
have
stopped
us,
however,
you
wish
to
phrase
it
for
the
carriage
of
signals,
especially
distant
signals.
they
also
state
that
the
phone
company,
the
general
telephone
case,
in
which
they
put
phone
companies
out
of
the
catv
retailing
business
and
their
service
areas,
was
such
as
to
give
us
open
entry
and
eliminate
a
potential
anti-competitive
threat.
i
say
to
you
that
the
new
england
power
rationale
for
this
without
even
arguing
about
whether
this
was
good
or
bad
for
us.
the
new
england
power
rationale
is
the
proper
rationale.
on
page
(d)
8
and
(d)
9
of
the
appendix
(d)
to
our
petition
for
certiorari
--
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
yes,
that
is
correct.
this
question
of
economic
climate
and
regulation
generally
benefiting
the
entire
industry
is
dealt
with
at
some
length
in
a
long
paragraph
on
page
(d)
8
and
(d)
9
of
this
opinion,
which
to
repeat
is
appended
as
appendix
(d)
to
our
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
where
the
court
states,
“the
creation
of
an
economic
climate
is
not
a
special
service
nor
is
a
particular
pipeline
or
gas
company,
substitute
catv
system,
the
special
beneficiary
of
such
a
climate
anymore
than
any
other
catv
system
or
the
consumer
in
general.”
skipping
then
to
the
last
portion
of
the
paragraph,
“the
commission’s
inadequate
response
to
the
identifiable
recipient
is
the
whole
industry,
assumes
that
each
company
receives
a
benefit
directly
proportional
to
revenue,
which
is
the
case
in
our
situation
where
the
fee
is
being
collected
proportion
to
revenue
because
they’re
collecting
it
per
subscriber.
there
is
far
more
to
regulation
than
simply
what
the
fcc
was
doing
and
in
fact
is
doing.
they
have
played
down
to
a
considerable
extent,
the
franchising
and
state
regulatory
activities
which
go
on.
no
matter
what
the
fcc
says,
there
is
no
catv
system
in
a
town
until
the
community
authorizes
the
operation
of
that
catv
system.
the
commission’s
statement
that
the
valuable
benefit
received
from
the
authorization
to
carry
signals
is
strange
in
light
of
the
fact
that
this
court
in
fortnightly
held
that
there
is
no
monetary
liability
for
the
carriage
of
signals
for
a
catv
system
under
the
copyright
law
and
thus
we
submit
that
not
only
are
the
fcc’s
regulations,
at
least
those
empowered
in
1970,
those
in
force
in
1970,
not
of
benefit
to
the
entire
industry,
but
that
there
is
far
more
to
the
regulation
of
cable
television
than
that
which
the
fcc
did
in
1970,
and
if
fact
that
which
they
do
now.
certainly
--
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
yes,
to
a
certain
extent
it
was
true.
certainly
it
wasn’t
true
for
those
catv
systems
which
were
owned
by
telephone
companies
nor
was
it
true
for
those
areas
where
the
telephone
company
posed
no
threat.
but
yes,
generally
speaking,
the
catv
industry
welcomed
it.
certainly
ncta
was
an
intervener
on
the
side
of
the
commission
in
the
defense
of
the
rules
which
put
the
telephone
companies
out
of
the
business
in
their
particular
area.
however,
even
assuming
going
on
then
to
the
next
argument,
even
assuming
that
some
of
their
regulation
can
be
stated
to
be
of
some
benefit
to
the
entire
industry,
and
i
would
hope
that
any
regulatory
agency’s
regulations
would
at
least
be
of
some
benefit
to
the
industries
which
it
is
regulating.
the
statute
as
interpreted
by
the
budget
bureau
call
for
an
identifiable
recipient,
thus
you
call
for
a
special
service
to
a
particular
company.
the
crux
of
this
entire
case,
i
believe
is
the
fcc’s
and
the
government
statement
that
where
you
benefit
the
entire
industry,
you
can
recover
the
regulatory
cost
for
that
on
a
pro
rata
basis.
the
examples
given
in
the
budget
bureau
circular
a-25
as
i
quoted
from
page
143
of
the
appendix
would
not
lead
you
to
conclude
that.
they
talk
about
receiving
a
patent,
crop
insurance,
license
to
carry
on
a
specific
business,
an
airman
certificate,
etcetera.
in
other
words,
something
is
gotten
by
an
individual
from
his
government.
he
is
not
simply
a
member
of
an
industry
which
is
being
regulated,
and
that
is
the
key.
that
is
the
key
to
this
case,
and
that
is
the
key
which
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
saw
in
its
interpretation
of
title
v,
where
it
stated
that
no
matter
what
kind
of
benefiting
you
were
doing
as
an
agency
to
the
entire
industry,
that
was
not
sufficient.
that
was
public
interest.
that
was
consumer
in
general.
that
was
entire
industry.
that
is
not
what
is
meant
by
title
v,
and
is
not
what
is
meant
by
the
budget
bureau
circular
a-25.
thus,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
there
is
no
relation
between
the
fee
and
services,
and
this
is
in
two
ways.
a
particular
catv
system
may
have
no
dealings
with
the
fcc
during
the
year
at
all,
and
still
get
charged
the
same
fees
as
the
same
size
catv
system
which
had
considerable
dealings
with
the
fcc.
and
furthermore,
even
if
both
my
hypothetical
systems
had
dealings
with
the
fcc,
the
number
of
subscribers
which
is
the
key
to
the
annual
fee
is
totally
unrelated
to
the
work
done
for
that
particular
system.
thus,
what
the
commission
is
doing
here
is
taxing
the
entire
industry
to
recoup
the
entire
cost
of
its
regulatory
program.
if
that
were
to
be
the
law,
there
would
be
no
practical
limit
on
the
amount
of
fees
that
the
fcc
could
collect,
so
long
as
they
could
obtain
a
higher
budget
for
their
catv
regulation.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
a
reply.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
first,
i
wanted
to
state
that
in
terms
of
the
budget
bureau
circular
a-25,
not
only
do
i
feel
that
the
legislative
history,
specifically
representative
yates’
remarks
placed
the
fcc
under
it,
but
the
fcc
has
assumed
that
it
is
under
it
because
it
named
its
reliance
on
budget
bureau
circular
a-25
in
its
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
in
docket
18-802
which
are
the
fees
under
consideration
here,
in
the
report
and
order,
and
in
the
1972
notice
in
docket
19-658
which
is
the
proposal
to
raise
the
fees,
so
i
believe
--
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
all
right
i
--
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
alright,
then
we
can
go
right
then
to
the
statute
and
allege
that
equally
under
the
statute,
the
same
is
true.
thus,
under
the
statute
it
talks
about
and
it
lists
a
whole
bunch
of
things,
top
of
the
statute,
it
must
be
to
or
for
any
person
and
then
in
parenthesis
it
gives
examples
of
persons,
partnership,
corporation,
group,
association,
but
never
does
it
say
industry.
and
in
so
interpreting
that,
the
bureau
of
the
budget
and
other
agencies,
until
this
time,
had
likewise
interpreted
it
as
meaning
a
specific
service
given
to
a
particular
individual.
thus,
even
though
it
says,
it
lists
particular
benefits
at
the
top
of
the
statute,
and
then
it
says
to
or
for
any
person
is
likewise
instructing
an
agency
to
deal
on
the
fee
matter
in
that
same
regard
as
the
bureau
of
the
budget
has
given
guidelines
as
to
how
it
carry
that
out.
now,
in
talking
about
what
benefits
we
get,
the
government
has
again
talked
about
all
of
the
1972
and
post
1972
regulations
which
it
has
bestowed
upon
the
catv
industry.
i
submit
that
the
fees
in
the
appeal
that
are
under
consideration
here
predate
the
1972
rules.
i
would
reserve
my
opportunity
to
argue
in
another
appeal
with
the
1972
rules
likewise
do
not
benefit
the
catv
industry
in
the
manner
in
which
is
alleged
that
they
do
so.
however,
these
are
not
the
rules
which
we
must
apply
these
fees
to.
now,
in
terms
of
the
statute
where
it
talks
about
taking
into
consideration
value
to
the
recipient
as
one
of
the
three
statutory
criteria,
there
again
the
commission
has
absolutely
failed.
it
is
a
pure
cost
allocation,
absolutely
a
pure
cost
allocation.
the
commission
talked
about
all
kinds
of
documents
that
it
had,
and
this
is
why
we
brought
our
freedom
of
information
suit
to
this
court’s
attention.
the
commission
said
it
had
all
the
kinds
of
documents
and
things
on
value
to
the
recipient,
one
of
the
three
statutory
criteria.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
what
i’m
stating
in
that
regard
is
that
let
us
assume
that
that
is
a
benefit
which
the
entire
industry
enjoys.
a
benefit
of
a
regulation
to
the
entire
industry
and
not
an
identifiable
catv
system
is
not
sufficient,
because
what
the
government
can
do
in
that
case
then
is
to
equate
regulation
with
benefit
and
then
equate
the
cost
of
regulation
with
the
fees
that
it
can
recover,
lock,
stock,
and
barrel
from
the
catv
industry.
and
i
do
not
think
that
title
v
authorizes
that
kind
of
an
equation.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
well
the
value
--
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
no,
i
do
not.
they
were
about
at
the
time
of
that
regulation,
they
were
about
perhaps
2000
or
a
little
more
catv
systems
in
operation.
there
were
approximately
35
or
40,
maybe
a
bit
more.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
to
an
extent
they
were
hurting,
but
certainly
some
people
did
not.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
that’s
right,
but
if
we
want
to
equate
that,
we
can
say
that
we
can
put
on
one
side
of
the
ledger
those
things
which
helped
us
with
those
things
that
hurt
us.
and
i
don’t
think
that
that
kind
of
equating
is
what
title
v
had
in
mind.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
i
disagree,
and
i
do
not
feel
that
title
v
enables
a
federal
agency
to
collect
its
entire
cost
of
regulation
of
an
industry
just
because
it
feels
that
that
regulation
is
needed.
whether
or
not
the
industry
desires
that
particular
piece
of
regulation,
because
--
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
that
is
correct.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
yes.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
precisely.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
it
is
my
feeling
that
this
title
then
only
enables
an
agency
to
promulgate
fees
that
relate
to
services
which
particular
payer
of
fees
receives
in
a
given
year.
thank
you.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
this
morning
arises
from
an
appeal
from
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals’
opinion
upholding
the
fee
schedule
of
the
federal
communications
commission
as
it
applies
to
the
catv
industry,
and
in
particular,
that
portion
of
the
fee
schedule
which
is
related
to
annual
fees
on
a
per
subscriber
basis.
in
general,
the
facts
are
as
follows.
in
1952,
as
a
writer
to
the
appropriations
act,
title
v
was
appended.
this
title
gives
the
federal
communications
commission
and
all
other
so
situated
agencies
the
power
to
enact
fees
to
collect
some
of
the
cost
of
regulation
which
they
incur.
as
a
part
of
this
act,
the
budget
bureau
under
the
president’s
office
was
directed
to
perpetrate
some
kinds
of
standards
for
the
collection
of
the
fees.
the
operative
document
in
this
case,
which
is
appended
in
the
appendix,
is
budget
bureau
circular
a-25,
which
was
last
amended
in
1959
so
that
is
the
circular
we
are
working
with
under
these
fees.
under
these
two
pieces
of
authority,
in
1963,
the
federal
communications
commission
first
enacted
fees.
these
fees
were
enacted
in
docket
14-507
and
they
were
based
on
applications
for
licenses
and
other
kinds
of
filings
made
in
front
of
the
fcc.
these
fees
collected
approximately
25%
of
the
budget
of
the
federal
communications
commission.
there
were
appeals
from
these
fees
incidentally
did
not
apply
to
the
catv
industry,
because
catv
was
not
at
that
time
regulated
by
the
federal
communications
commission.
in
the
seventh
circuit,
in
a
case
called
aeronautical
radio,
inc.
v.
u.s.
and
later
this
supreme
court
affirmed
the
fcc’s
fees,
and
in
so
doing
stated
that
title
v
of
the
1952
appropriations
act
enabled
the
fcc
to
collect
these
filing
fess.
in
1970,
the
commission
decided
to
revise
its
fee
schedule.
so
they
filed
in
february
of
1970
a
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking.
this
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
proposed
to
do
three
or
four
things.
it
proposed
to
raise
the
filing
fees,
it
proposed
to
add
catv
for
the
first
time,
including
filing
fees,
since
they
had
now
taken
jurisdiction
over
catv
as
far
back
as
1965
and
1966,
and
annual
fees
were
added.
in
particular
for
catv,
the
annual
fees
were
to
collect
some
90%
to
95%
of
the
fees
which
the
fcc
decided
it
wished
to
collect
from
the
catv
industry.
these
annual
fees
which
were
adopted
later
in
1970
were
done
on
a
per
subscriber
basis,
30
cents
per
subscriber.
a
catv
system
obtains
the
vast
bulk
of
its
revenue
from
subscribing
homes
which
it
hooks
up
to
its
system,
and
it
is
usually
expressed
--
the
size
of
a
system
is
expressed
in
the
number
of
subscribers.
the
fcc
therefore,
stated
its
annual
fee
on
a
basis
of
per
subscriber
fee,
thus
30
cents.
parenthetically,
as
is
noted
in
our
brief,
the
1972
still
outstanding
rulemaking
proposes
to
raise
these
fees
from
30
cents
per
subscriber
to
40
cents.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
yes,
the
activity
costs
are
on
page
31
of
the
appendix,
and
it
gives
the
cost
as
$1,145,400
or
4.6%
of
the
fcc’s
budget.
now,
these
costs
incidentally
are
both
direct
costs
of
the
cable
bureau
and
attributable
costs
such
things
as
the
field
engineering
bureau
and
the
commissioner’s
offices
which
cannot
be
attributed
a
lock,
stock,
and
barrel
to
one
activity,
but
are
spread
as
a
percentage
across.
so
you
have
direct
cost
and
then
you
have
indirect
cost.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
i
would
presume
so,
yes.
several
parties
appealed
the
commission’s
report
and
order
of
july
1970
and
the
first
appeal
was
filed
in
the
fifth
circuit
so
all
appeals
were
transferred
there.
and
in
the
clay
case,
which
is
the
decision
before
you,
in
1972
the
fcc
was
upheld
in
all
particulars.
the
catv
industry’s
appeal
was
based
on
the
annual
fee,
and
the
allegations
were
that
the
annual
fee
was
not
related
to
the
statutory
criteria
of
the
appropriations
act
and
had
misapplied
the
criteria
stated
in
budget
bureau
circular
a-25.
now,
in
more
detail,
the
authority
to
collect
fees
comes
from
title
v,
and
this
is
reprinted
on
page
151
of
the
appendix.
and
in
that
section,
they
state
that
congress
--
it
is
the
sense
of
the
congress
that
any
and
it
lists
several
things,
these
types
of
activities
are
done
by
an
agency,
shall
be
self-sustaining
to
the
full
extent
possible.
and
then
it
states
subject
to
such
policies
as
the
president
may
prescribe,
which
is
the
authority
for
budget
bureau
circular
a-25.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say
about
two-thirds
of
the
way
down
that
statute,
and
these
are
the
operative
criteria;
that
the
fees
must
be
fair
and
equitable
taking
into
consideration
(1)
direct
and
indirect
cost
to
the
government,
(2)
value
to
the
recipient,
(3)
public
policy
or
interest
served,
and
(4)
other
pertinent
facts.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
that
is
correct.
the
companion
case
has
some
arguments
about
stuff
in
the
federal
power
commission
act,
but
there
is
no
authority
in
the
federal
communications
act
with
one
small
example,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
catv,
so
we
are
discussing
this
particular
statute.
budget
bureau
circular
a-25
which
begins
on
page
142
of
the
appendix
interprets
this
statute
and
lays
out
for
the
federal
agencies
how
they
are
to
go
about
setting
fees.
the
first
important
statement
is
on
page
142
of
the
appendix
under
section
2
coverage,
where
it
states
in
the
second
line,
“the
provisions
of
this
circular
cover
all
federal
activities
which
convey
special
benefits
to
recipients
above
and
beyond
those
accruing
to
the
public
at
large.”
then
on
page
143,
all
of
section
3
(a)
states
the
criteria.
the
most
important
of
which
are
set
out
right
in
the
top
of
the
page
where
it
states
under
general
policy,
a
reasonable
charge,
as
described
below,
should
be
made
to
(1)
each
identifiable
recipient,
(2)
for
a
measurable
unit
or
amount
of
government
service
or
property
from
which
(3)
derives
a
special
benefit.
so
the
identifiable
recipient,
measurable
unit
of
service,
and
special
benefit
criteria
are
what
i
believe,
i
submit,
that
we
should
be
looking
for
in
the
promulgation
of
these
fcc
fees.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
i
do,
yes
sir.
the
assumption
has
been
made
that
it
did.
this
question
was
not
handled
in
the
court
below,
and
the
congress
and
the
hearings
which
is
cited
by
the
government
in
1969
which
urged
the
agencies
to
go
forward,
were
urging
the
commission
to
go
forward
under
this,
and
the
federal
communications
commission
was
one
of
the
examples
that
were
used
in
the
original
legislative
history.
now,
under
special
services
on
page
143
of
the
appendix,
several
things
are
listed.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
no,
but
in
the
process
of
budgets,
and
the
process
of
promulgating
forms,
in
the
process
of
many
things
that
the
commission
does,
you
must
go
through
the
bureau
of
the
budget.
for
example,
when
the
commission
--
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
i
think
that
the
act
states
that
you
must
follow
the
criteria
that
are
set
down
by
the
president,
thus
the
act
states
that
subject
to
such
policies
as
the
president
may
prescribe.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
i’m
reading
in
the
middle
of
the
title
v
which
is
found
on
155
of
the
appendix.
and
it’s
pursuant
to
this
phrase
that
budget
bureau
circular
a-25
was
promulgated
by
the
president’s
bureau
of
the
budget.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
that’s
correct.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
the
government
i
believe,
has
suggested
this
in
one
paragraph
in
its
brief,
but
i
believe
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
substantiates
the
view
that
it
was
intended
that
such
guidelines
would
be
set
down
for
all
agencies
which
were
both
congressional
and
executive
departments.
and
as
such,
the
guidelines
in
budget
bureau
a-25
have
the
agencies
that
have
promulgated
fees
have
attempted
to
follow
these
no
matter
which
category
they
have
been
in.
and
this
was
the
area
which
was
looked
at
in
fact
by
the
courts
in
the
aeronautical
radio
case.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
yes,
thus
when
the
commission
goes
to
the
bureau
of
the
budget
with
its
budget,
difficulties
which
omb
has
are
hammered
out.
thus,
the
commission’s
budget
maybe
decreased
or
increased
by
the
bureau
of
the
budget
before
it
ever
sees
the
appropriate
appropriations
committee
in
congress.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
that
is
correct.
the
criteria
in
the
budget
bureau
circular
are
then
followed
on
page
143
of
the
appendix,
by
a
listing
of
the
kinds
of
special
services
for
which
fees
are
authorized
to
be
collected.
thus,
in
1
(a),
(b),
and
(c)
there
are
examples,
receiving
patents,
craft
insurance,
license
to
carry
on
a
specific
business,
certificates
of
necessity
and
convenience,
in
(b)
safety
inspections
of
craft,
etcetera.
we
submit
that
the
common
thread
in
all
of
these
examples
is
that
a
particular
identifiable
entity
has
received
in
identifiable
benefit.
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
i
believe
bears
this
out.
thus,
in
the
senate
reports
which
are
quoted
at
some
length
on
pages
22
through
26
of
the
ncta
reply
brief,
you
will
find
language
to
that
effect,
likewise,
the
sole
floor
comments,
since
there
was
limited
floor
debate
on
that
by
representative
yates
printed
on
page
25
and
26
of
our
reply
brief,
talk
about
portion,
getting
fees
back
for
a
portion
of
the
operations.
it
talks
about
applications
for
certificates
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
being
paid
for
by
the
person
who
applied
for
it.
so
that
it
is
our
feeling
that
the
legislative
history
supports
the
interpretation
of
the
act,
which
we
are
giving
and
which
we
feel
that
the
budget
bureau
gave
in
circular
a-25.
now,
in
aeronautical
radio
what
was
before
that
court,
the
supreme
court
and
the
seventh
circuit
were
the
questions
under
specific
filing
fees,
and
unless
there
be
any
doubt
of
that,
on
page
33
of
ncta’s
opening
brief,
we
quoted
from
the
commission’s
report
and
order
at
that
time
where
the
commission
was
adopting
filing
fees
and
stated
that
they
were
obtaining
to
the
full
extent
possible
fees
for
services
which
bestow
special
privileges
and
services
upon
certain
individuals
who
may
apply
for
those
privileges
and
services.
so
certainly
what
the
commission,
the
fcc
was
doing
at
that
time
was
decidedly
limited
to
the
voluntary
filing
for
special
privileges.
then,
in
the
new
england
power
case,
which
is
the
companion
case
to
this
one,
the
court
there
was
faced
with
a
similar
interpretation
as
to
what
the
fcc
is
attempting
to
ask
this
court
to
interpret
the
budget
bureau
circular
and
the
statute
as,
and
in
that
case
it
was
rejected
and
i
will
get
into
that
one
a
bit
more.
these
then
are
the
authorities
which
are
prevailing
for
the
justification
of
the
fcc’s
fees,
and
the
limits
that
we
feel
are
placed
on
them.
now,
going
down
in
the
argument,
the
criteria
in
terms
of
special
benefit,
we
have
argued
in
our
brief,
and
the
government
has
argued
back
and
forth
as
to
whether
the
fcc’s
regulation
of
catv
is
provided
in
these
special
benefits
to
the
catv
industry.
it
is
our
allegation
that
the
fcc’s
regulation
has
been
bad
for
our
industry.
that
it
has
had
a
very
deleterious
effect
and
that
in
fact
in
the
years
under
review
here
from
1968
to
1972
which
cover
all
of
the
years
of
the
fees
that
are
under
review
today,
there
was
in
fact
a
freeze
on
catv
growth.
up
until
1966
or
65
rather,
there
was
a
rather
unlimited
growth
on
catv,
it
was
limited
by
its
own
constraints
and
limited
by
a
local
law,
but
not
by
the
fcc.
starting
in
1965,
the
fcc
begun
to
regulate
quite
heavily
and
their
1966
second
report
and
order,
which
was
reviewed
by
this
court
in
u.s.
v.
southwestern.
that
particular
report
and
order
did
not
work
out
well,
and
there
is
plenty
of
documentation
to
that
effect
in
the
briefs,
and
in
the
fcc’s
own
reports
and
orders,
and
notice
of
proposed
--
rulemaking
proposing
to
change
their
rules.
in
december
of
1968,
all
growth
of
catv
in
their
larger
markets
was
frozen.
several
attempts
to
unfreeze
this
situation
went
for
naught,
and
finally
in
february
of
1972.
long
after
the
fees
in
question
were
enacted,
and
long
after
the
appeal
from
the
fee
schedule
was
taken,
the
fcc
adopted
some
new
rules
in
1972.
the
fcc
has
attempted
to
bring
these
1972
rules
into
play
in
this
case.
i
very
strongly
submit
that
whatever
the
1972
rules
do
or
did
not
do
for
the
catv
industry,
they
were
not
the
rules
and
not
the
regulations
which
were
in
effect
at
the
time
that
these
fees
were
promulgated,
nor
were
they
in
effect
for
the
two-and-a-half
years
in
which
these
fees
were
collected,
and
that
which
covers
the
period
from
the
promulgation
of
the
fees
in
1970
until
the
new
rules
in
1972.
now
the
commission
has
stated
that
even
in
1970
at
the
time
these
fees
were
promulgated,
there
was
much
to
say
for
the
fcc’s
regulation
that
would
give
a
special
benefit
to
the
catv
industry.
thus,
they
state
that
we
had
to
have
authorization,
or
permission,
or
they
could
have
stopped
us,
however,
you
wish
to
phrase
it
for
the
carriage
of
signals,
especially
distant
signals.
they
also
state
that
the
phone
company,
the
general
telephone
case,
in
which
they
put
phone
companies
out
of
the
catv
retailing
business
and
their
service
areas,
was
such
as
to
give
us
open
entry
and
eliminate
a
potential
anti-competitive
threat.
i
say
to
you
that
the
new
england
power
rationale
for
this
without
even
arguing
about
whether
this
was
good
or
bad
for
us.
the
new
england
power
rationale
is
the
proper
rationale.
on
page
(d)
8
and
(d)
9
of
the
appendix
(d)
to
our
petition
for
certiorari
--
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
yes,
that
is
correct.
this
question
of
economic
climate
and
regulation
generally
benefiting
the
entire
industry
is
dealt
with
at
some
length
in
a
long
paragraph
on
page
(d)
8
and
(d)
9
of
this
opinion,
which
to
repeat
is
appended
as
appendix
(d)
to
our
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
where
the
court
states,
“the
creation
of
an
economic
climate
is
not
a
special
service
nor
is
a
particular
pipeline
or
gas
company,
substitute
catv
system,
the
special
beneficiary
of
such
a
climate
anymore
than
any
other
catv
system
or
the
consumer
in
general.”
skipping
then
to
the
last
portion
of
the
paragraph,
“the
commission’s
inadequate
response
to
the
identifiable
recipient
is
the
whole
industry,
assumes
that
each
company
receives
a
benefit
directly
proportional
to
revenue,
which
is
the
case
in
our
situation
where
the
fee
is
being
collected
proportion
to
revenue
because
they’re
collecting
it
per
subscriber.
there
is
far
more
to
regulation
than
simply
what
the
fcc
was
doing
and
in
fact
is
doing.
they
have
played
down
to
a
considerable
extent,
the
franchising
and
state
regulatory
activities
which
go
on.
no
matter
what
the
fcc
says,
there
is
no
catv
system
in
a
town
until
the
community
authorizes
the
operation
of
that
catv
system.
the
commission’s
statement
that
the
valuable
benefit
received
from
the
authorization
to
carry
signals
is
strange
in
light
of
the
fact
that
this
court
in
fortnightly
held
that
there
is
no
monetary
liability
for
the
carriage
of
signals
for
a
catv
system
under
the
copyright
law
and
thus
we
submit
that
not
only
are
the
fcc’s
regulations,
at
least
those
empowered
in
1970,
those
in
force
in
1970,
not
of
benefit
to
the
entire
industry,
but
that
there
is
far
more
to
the
regulation
of
cable
television
than
that
which
the
fcc
did
in
1970,
and
if
fact
that
which
they
do
now.
certainly
--
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
yes,
to
a
certain
extent
it
was
true.
certainly
it
wasn’t
true
for
those
catv
systems
which
were
owned
by
telephone
companies
nor
was
it
true
for
those
areas
where
the
telephone
company
posed
no
threat.
but
yes,
generally
speaking,
the
catv
industry
welcomed
it.
certainly
ncta
was
an
intervener
on
the
side
of
the
commission
in
the
defense
of
the
rules
which
put
the
telephone
companies
out
of
the
business
in
their
particular
area.
however,
even
assuming
going
on
then
to
the
next
argument,
even
assuming
that
some
of
their
regulation
can
be
stated
to
be
of
some
benefit
to
the
entire
industry,
and
i
would
hope
that
any
regulatory
agency’s
regulations
would
at
least
be
of
some
benefit
to
the
industries
which
it
is
regulating.
the
statute
as
interpreted
by
the
budget
bureau
call
for
an
identifiable
recipient,
thus
you
call
for
a
special
service
to
a
particular
company.
the
crux
of
this
entire
case,
i
believe
is
the
fcc’s
and
the
government
statement
that
where
you
benefit
the
entire
industry,
you
can
recover
the
regulatory
cost
for
that
on
a
pro
rata
basis.
the
examples
given
in
the
budget
bureau
circular
a-25
as
i
quoted
from
page
143
of
the
appendix
would
not
lead
you
to
conclude
that.
they
talk
about
receiving
a
patent,
crop
insurance,
license
to
carry
on
a
specific
business,
an
airman
certificate,
etcetera.
in
other
words,
something
is
gotten
by
an
individual
from
his
government.
he
is
not
simply
a
member
of
an
industry
which
is
being
regulated,
and
that
is
the
key.
that
is
the
key
to
this
case,
and
that
is
the
key
which
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
saw
in
its
interpretation
of
title
v,
where
it
stated
that
no
matter
what
kind
of
benefiting
you
were
doing
as
an
agency
to
the
entire
industry,
that
was
not
sufficient.
that
was
public
interest.
that
was
consumer
in
general.
that
was
entire
industry.
that
is
not
what
is
meant
by
title
v,
and
is
not
what
is
meant
by
the
budget
bureau
circular
a-25.
thus,
what
i
am
saying
is
that
there
is
no
relation
between
the
fee
and
services,
and
this
is
in
two
ways.
a
particular
catv
system
may
have
no
dealings
with
the
fcc
during
the
year
at
all,
and
still
get
charged
the
same
fees
as
the
same
size
catv
system
which
had
considerable
dealings
with
the
fcc.
and
furthermore,
even
if
both
my
hypothetical
systems
had
dealings
with
the
fcc,
the
number
of
subscribers
which
is
the
key
to
the
annual
fee
is
totally
unrelated
to
the
work
done
for
that
particular
system.
thus,
what
the
commission
is
doing
here
is
taxing
the
entire
industry
to
recoup
the
entire
cost
of
its
regulatory
program.
if
that
were
to
be
the
law,
there
would
be
no
practical
limit
on
the
amount
of
fees
that
the
fcc
could
collect,
so
long
as
they
could
obtain
a
higher
budget
for
their
catv
regulation.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
a
reply.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
first,
i
wanted
to
state
that
in
terms
of
the
budget
bureau
circular
a-25,
not
only
do
i
feel
that
the
legislative
history,
specifically
representative
yates’
remarks
placed
the
fcc
under
it,
but
the
fcc
has
assumed
that
it
is
under
it
because
it
named
its
reliance
on
budget
bureau
circular
a-25
in
its
notice
of
proposed
rulemaking
in
docket
18-802
which
are
the
fees
under
consideration
here,
in
the
report
and
order,
and
in
the
1972
notice
in
docket
19-658
which
is
the
proposal
to
raise
the
fees,
so
i
believe
--
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
all
right
i
--
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
alright,
then
we
can
go
right
then
to
the
statute
and
allege
that
equally
under
the
statute,
the
same
is
true.
thus,
under
the
statute
it
talks
about
and
it
lists
a
whole
bunch
of
things,
top
of
the
statute,
it
must
be
to
or
for
any
person
and
then
in
parenthesis
it
gives
examples
of
persons,
partnership,
corporation,
group,
association,
but
never
does
it
say
industry.
and
in
so
interpreting
that,
the
bureau
of
the
budget
and
other
agencies,
until
this
time,
had
likewise
interpreted
it
as
meaning
a
specific
service
given
to
a
particular
individual.
thus,
even
though
it
says,
it
lists
particular
benefits
at
the
top
of
the
statute,
and
then
it
says
to
or
for
any
person
is
likewise
instructing
an
agency
to
deal
on
the
fee
matter
in
that
same
regard
as
the
bureau
of
the
budget
has
given
guidelines
as
to
how
it
carry
that
out.
now,
in
talking
about
what
benefits
we
get,
the
government
has
again
talked
about
all
of
the
1972
and
post
1972
regulations
which
it
has
bestowed
upon
the
catv
industry.
i
submit
that
the
fees
in
the
appeal
that
are
under
consideration
here
predate
the
1972
rules.
i
would
reserve
my
opportunity
to
argue
in
another
appeal
with
the
1972
rules
likewise
do
not
benefit
the
catv
industry
in
the
manner
in
which
is
alleged
that
they
do
so.
however,
these
are
not
the
rules
which
we
must
apply
these
fees
to.
now,
in
terms
of
the
statute
where
it
talks
about
taking
into
consideration
value
to
the
recipient
as
one
of
the
three
statutory
criteria,
there
again
the
commission
has
absolutely
failed.
it
is
a
pure
cost
allocation,
absolutely
a
pure
cost
allocation.
the
commission
talked
about
all
kinds
of
documents
that
it
had,
and
this
is
why
we
brought
our
freedom
of
information
suit
to
this
court’s
attention.
the
commission
said
it
had
all
the
kinds
of
documents
and
things
on
value
to
the
recipient,
one
of
the
three
statutory
criteria.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
what
i’m
stating
in
that
regard
is
that
let
us
assume
that
that
is
a
benefit
which
the
entire
industry
enjoys.
a
benefit
of
a
regulation
to
the
entire
industry
and
not
an
identifiable
catv
system
is
not
sufficient,
because
what
the
government
can
do
in
that
case
then
is
to
equate
regulation
with
benefit
and
then
equate
the
cost
of
regulation
with
the
fees
that
it
can
recover,
lock,
stock,
and
barrel
from
the
catv
industry.
and
i
do
not
think
that
title
v
authorizes
that
kind
of
an
equation.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
well
the
value
--
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
no,
i
do
not.
they
were
about
at
the
time
of
that
regulation,
they
were
about
perhaps
2000
or
a
little
more
catv
systems
in
operation.
there
were
approximately
35
or
40,
maybe
a
bit
more.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
to
an
extent
they
were
hurting,
but
certainly
some
people
did
not.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
that’s
right,
but
if
we
want
to
equate
that,
we
can
say
that
we
can
put
on
one
side
of
the
ledger
those
things
which
helped
us
with
those
things
that
hurt
us.
and
i
don’t
think
that
that
kind
of
equating
is
what
title
v
had
in
mind.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
i
disagree,
and
i
do
not
feel
that
title
v
enables
a
federal
agency
to
collect
its
entire
cost
of
regulation
of
an
industry
just
because
it
feels
that
that
regulation
is
needed.
whether
or
not
the
industry
desires
that
particular
piece
of
regulation,
because
--
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
that
is
correct.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
yes.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
precisely.
mr.
stuart
f.
feldstein
it
is
my
feeling
that
this
title
then
only
enables
an
agency
to
promulgate
fees
that
relate
to
services
which
particular
payer
of
fees
receives
in
a
given
year.
thank
you.
