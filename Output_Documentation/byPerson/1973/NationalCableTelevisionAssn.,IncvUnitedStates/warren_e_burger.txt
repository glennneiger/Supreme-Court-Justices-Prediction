chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
72-948,
national
cable
television
against
the
united
states
and
the
federal
communications
commission.
mr.
feldstein
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
somewhere
in
the
briefs
or
perhaps
in
the
appendix,
i
saw
some
figure
as
to
the
total
cost
to
the
commission
for
the
people
engaged
in
the
regulatory
work
relating
to
cable
television.
do
you
recall
what
that
figure
is
just
approximately?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
will
it
be
fair
to
say
that
if
cable
television
disappeared
from
the
face
of
the
earth
for
some
reason
or
other
that
most
of
that
million
dollars
plus
would
be
out
of
their
budget?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question
about
the
posture
of
bureau
of
the
budget
circular,
i
suppose
it’s
a
fact
that
all
of
the
agencies
must
put
their
budgets
through
the
bureau
of
the
budget,
and
that
historically
it
has
been
a
coordinating
agency
and
because
of
its
authority,
shape,
and
frame
the
budgets
of
the
agencies,
it
has
considerable
leverage,
does
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
whether
this
congress
of
course
could
increase
a
budget,
but
to
the
budget
bureau
has
initially
a
great
deal
of
authority
in
the
way
of
enforcement
here,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
the
agency
may
not
generally
ask
for
something
which
the
bureau
of
the
budget
and
omb
has
declined
to
approve,
is
this
not
that
correct?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
say
that
if
it
were
some
benefit
to
the
cable
television
industry
when
telephone
companies
were
taken
out
of
the
play,
out
of
the
picture
as
competitors?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well
mr.
feldstein.
mr.
korman.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
the
certificate
of
compliance
is
to
be
equated
with
the
certificate
of
public
convenience
and
necessity
for
example?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
suggesting
that
it’s
inherent
in
any
regulatory
agency
that
it
giveth
and
it
taketh
away,
but
at
either
act
as
a
part
of
the
regulatory
process,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
korman.
mr.
feldstein,
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
you’ve
already
conceded
quite
a
few
benefits
to
the
industry
and
to
individual
members
of
the
industry
in
terms
of
being
spared
the
competition
of
telephone
companies
who
could’ve
taken
over
the
entire
industry
lock,
stock,
and
barrel,
and
several
other
items?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
feldstein.
thank
you
mr.
korman.
the
case
is
submitted.

justice
