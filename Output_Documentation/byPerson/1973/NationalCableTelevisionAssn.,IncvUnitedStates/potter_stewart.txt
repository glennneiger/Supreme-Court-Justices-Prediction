justice

stewart
was
this
circular
a-25
in
fact
addressed
to
the
federal
communications
commission,
was
the
commission
in
other
words,
one
of
the
addressees?
justice

justice
potter
stewart
i
wonder
if
that
did
or
did
not
include
the
federal
communications
commission?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
that
your
point
or
a
point
that
you
made
is
that
the
commission
is
not
an
executive
department,
and
or
establishment?
justice
potter
stewart
and
further
that
the
statute
title
v,
requires
uniformity
to
the
extent
practicable
only
with
respect
to
agencies
in
the
executive
branch?
justice
potter
stewart
why?
justice
potter
stewart
is
symmetry
just
good
for
its
own
sake?
justice
potter
stewart
should
you
treat
things
alike
that
are
different?
is
that
wise
and
desirable?
justice
potter
stewart
how
true
if
a
franchise,
it’s
not
a
license
in
any
sense
of
the
word,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
it’s
not
equivalent
in
other
words,
to
a
radio
or
television
broadcasting?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
doesn’t
answer
the
question,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
doesn’t
answer
the
question
either.
justice
potter
stewart
not
a
license,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
not
called
the
license
and
it
isn't
a
license
and
there’s
no
authority
is
there
to
license?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
title
v?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
any
event
the
filing
fees,
the
so-called
filing
fees
as
such
are
not
an
issue
here,
are
they?
justice
potter
stewart
what
do
you
consider
that
the
phrase
to
the
full
extent
possible,
does
that
mean
the
same
thing
as
the
fullest
extent
possible?
justice
potter
stewart
you
never
heard
the
phrase
“to
the
full
extent
possible”
have
you
before,
anywhere
else?
justice
potter
stewart
did
the
action
of
the
commission
getting
telephone
companies
out
of
the
business
occurred
during
this
period
that
we’re
talking
about,
this
four-year
period?
justice
potter
stewart
and
are
you
charging
the
telephone
companies
for
that
service
putting
them
out
of
business?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
does
--
these
charges
would
be
levied
against,
wouldn’t
they,
the
telephone
companies
for
so
long
as
they
were
in
business
during
this
period?
justice
potter
stewart
for
the
service
you
gave
on
putting
them
out
of
business?
justice
potter
stewart
well
they
have
to
represent
the
industry,
don’t
they?
justice
potter
stewart
well
in
any
event,
those
fees
are
an
issue
here,
aren’t
they?
the
fees
charged
against
everybody?
that’s
what’s
before
us
here,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that
these
fees
are
charged
to
those
companies?
justice
potter
stewart
whom
you
put
out
of
business?
justice
potter
stewart
quite
a
benefit.
justice
potter
stewart
congress
i
suppose
could’ve
passed
a
legislation,
specific
legislation,
requiring
exactly
the
same
thing,
and
that
is
imposing
maximum
fees
on
franchises?
justice
potter
stewart
could
congress
send
the
beneficiaries
of
that
legislation
a
bill,
do
you
suppose,
for
each
service
to
them?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
specifically.
specifically,
say
we
benefited
you
specifically
by
seeing
to
it
that
no
municipality,
or
county,
or
local
government
charges
more
than
“x”
percent
for
its
franchise.
now,
they
send,
and
every
congressman
or
to
the
congress
$10,000
a
piece.
justice
potter
stewart
there’s
all
sorts
of
special
legislation
in
congress.
in
fact
there’s
hardly
a
law
that
congress
passes
that
doesn’t
benefit
an
identifiable
group,
isn’t
that
correct?
justice
potter
stewart
and
it’s
all
in
the
public
interest
by
hypothesis.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
by
hypothesis,
by
definition?
justice
potter
stewart
and
whether
or
not
the
industry
on
that
balance,
benefits?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
not
really
essentially
your
argument
either.
you
could’ve
concede
a
benefit
to
the
industry
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
but
your
basic
point
is
that
the
charge
can’t
be
based
upon
industry
wide
benefit?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
the
question
is
whether
this
sets
up
kind
of
a
blue
cross
system
or
not?
whether
or
not
you
can
pay
every
year
even
though
you
don’t
go
to
the
hospital
and
what
you
pay
for
is
the
existence
of
the
hospital
facilities
that
are
there
available
to
you
when
you
do
get
sick.
