justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
solicitor
general,
despite
the
overwhelming
evidences
you
say
it
guilt,
i
gather
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
the
district
court
that
this
was
case
in
which
harrington's
harmless
errors
rules
required.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
as
it
comes
to
us
at
least
that
issue
of
the
harmless
error
is
not
before
us.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
did
you
argue
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
oh!
you
did.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
you
suggest
that
the
ninth
circuit
apparently
adopted
the
view
that
any
constitutional
error
which
is
quite
judicial
per
se
and
that's
what
obligated
the
harmless
error
determination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
see
that
the
mathes
form
by
many,
many
years,
but
the
mathes
form
was
almost
universally
disfavored,
shall
i
put
it
by
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
this
the
only
circuit
to
say
however
that
it
has
a
constitutional
infirmity?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
supervised.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
don’t
suppose
it
would
make
any
difference,
but
let
me
ask
you
mr.
runkel,
suppose
in
speaking
of
overcoming
the
presumption,
this
being
a
case
where
there
was
no
evidence
other
than
state's
witnesses,
had
the
court
left
out
by
evidence
affecting
his
or
her
character,
because
so
was
none,
by
contradictory
evidence,
because
so
was
none,
and
this
has
just
been
left
with
overcome
by
the
manner
in
which
the
witness
testifies,
by
the
nature
of
his
or
her
testimony,
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
but
even
though
this
tells
the
jury,
in
effect,
if
you
just
don't
believe
and
you
think
the
witness
is
lying
then
that's
not
end
of
the
presumption.
isn't
that
in
fact
of
the
court's
instruction.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
since
i
have
interrupted
you?
in
your
own
experience
--
i
gather
this
instruction
in
oregon
as
discretionary
by
the
the
trial
judge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
first
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
your
own
experience,
does
it
make
a
difference
for
the
trial
judge
whether
the
defense
has
put
on
a
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
do
you
read
what
the
ninth
circuit
had
said
about
harmless
error,
it's
constitutional
error
automatically
--
it
is
a
judicial
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
what
what
does
this
language
mean
in
the
opinion?
the
appellee
also
contends
that
the
instruction
--
i
am
looking
at
page
21
of
the
--
even
a
federally
defective
under
the
federal
constitution
was
in
the
circumstances
--
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
we
reject
this
argument
also
once
not
established
infringement
of
a
constitutionally
protected
right,
the
burden
shifted
to
the
appellee
to
establish
that
the
error
was
harmless.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
your
argument
does
rest
on
our
acceptance
of
your
proposition
that
this
was
a
constitutional
error,
instruction
is
a
constitutional
error,
doesn't
it?

j.
