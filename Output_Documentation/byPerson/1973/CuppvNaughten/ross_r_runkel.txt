mr.
ross
r.
runkel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
just
like
to
quote
a
couple
of
more
lines
from
the
instruction
to
be
with.
the
appendix,
page
15,
the
judge
instructs
the
jury
on
what
a
presumption
means.
a
presumption
is
a
deduction
which
the
law
expressly
directs
to
be
made
from
particular
facts
and
so
on.
and
then
proceeds
to
discuss
the
various
presumptions
involved
of
which
there
are
really
only
two,
this
truthfulness
presumption
and
so-called
the
presumption
of
innocence.
now,
it's
our
position
that
the
truthfulness
presumption
is
in
direct
contradiction
in
terms,
in
theory,
and
in
effect
to
the
constitutional
burden
of
proof.
the
burden
of
proof
means
--
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
it's
in
the
due
process
clause,
your
honor.
by
decision
of
this
court
and
several
others.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
no,
it's
not
expressed,
it's
not
expressed.
the
burden
of
proof
means
a
number
of
things.
it
can
mean
the
burden
of
pleading,
the
burden
of
proceeding
with
the
evidence,
the
burden
of
persuasion,
and
the
only
meaning
it
can
really
have
that
has
any
effect
is
the
burden
of
persuading
the
jury
of
the
truth
of
the
allegations.
and
so
by
saying
that
you
were
to
presume
that
whatever
these
witnesses
say
is
true,
seems
to
me
that's
in
direct
contradiction
to
the
concept
of
the
burden
of
proof
being
on
the
state.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
now
it
makes
a
big
difference.
i
think
the
position
of
the
state
seems
to
be
that
may
be
the
instruction
was
given
at
the
beginning,
because
perhaps
when
the
witness
first
gets
on
the
stand,
you
might
accord
him
certain
deference
that
he
will
not
either
lie
or
make
innocent
errors.
but,
now
we
are
dealing
with
a
situation
where
the
witnesses
have
already
testified
and
now
you
are
telling
the
jury
that
they
must
presume
that
these
witnesses
in
fact
have
testified
truthfully.
and
i
would
like
to
contrast
that
with
another
point
in
time
where
we
talk
about
the
truthfulness
of
witnesses
and
that's
on
appeal.
i
have
cited
innumerable
cases
where
the
comment
is
made
that
witnesses
should
be
presumed
to
have
told
the
truth.
and
here
we
are
doing
a
completely
difference
thing.
now,
we
are
looking
back
on
the
case
and
saying
was
there
sufficient
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury,
and
in
testing
the
sufficiency
of
evidence
of
course,
we
take
the
case
in
most
favorable
state
and
by
doing
that
we
presume
that
the
witnesses
did
tell
the
truth.
but,
that
only
gets
us
pass
the
question
of
whether
the
case
should
go
to
the
jury.
and
now
what
we
are
doing
in
this
case
is
what
state
is
saying,
the
judge
is
saying,
this
evidence
is
sufficient,
therefore
it
goes
to
the
jury,
and
secondly
you
must
presume
that
this
sufficient
evidence
is
in
fact
true.
and
it
seems
to
me
then
that
there
is
really
no
difference
at
all
between
the
sufficiency
of
evidence
rule
which
may
simply
mean
that
there
is
some
evidence
and
the
rule
that
the
burden
of
persuasion
lies
with
the
state.
it
seems
to
me
they
are
hopelessly
confused
by
this
instruction.
but,
i
would
say
that
if
the
instruction
were
given
at
the
outset,
it
certainly
would
make
more
sense.
now,
it's
inescapable,
we
have
to
talk
about
presumption
and
inference
cases.
i
am
taking
the
position,
of
course,
that
this
is
not
really
a
true
presumption
at
all
because
a
presumption
is
a
situation
where
you
have
a
fact
proved
and
the
jury
has
told
that
from
that
they
should
deduce
a
second
fact.
in
this
case
it
seems
to
me
there
is
no
proved
fact.
but,
i
think
it's
important
to
distinguish
the
line
of
cases
in
this
court,
the
most
recent
one
being
barnes
from
the
spring,
working
all
the
way
back
through
gainy,
romano,
todd,
bowen,
black
and
so
on.
firstly
all
of
which
it
seems
to
me
involve
inferences.
in
other
words,
the
jury
has
told,
you
may
if
you
wish
link
these
two
facts
together
in
your
minds.
in
this
case
the
jury
has
told
you
are
expressly
directed
to
link
these
two
facts
in
your
minds.
now,
the
reformulation
of
the
inference
rule
in
barnes
seems
to
be
that
the
judge
may
instruct
on
an
inference,
if
a
rational
juror
--
this
is
not
in
my
brief,
because
i
think
that
was
decided
about
the
time
i
was
in
printer’s
office.
if
a
rational
juror
would
be
able
to
link
the
two
facts
and
find
that
the
presumed
fact
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
but,
that's
in
a
mere
inference.
here
we
are
telling
the
jury
that
you
must
find.
and
in
that
case
it
seems
to
me
that
judge
can
give
the
instruction
only
if
a
judge
himself
would
find
that
the
facts
are
linked
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
because
the
jury
has
no
option
at
all.
they
must
find
this
fact
to
be
true.
and
if
i
can
make
a
comment
about
vlandis
against
kline
which
is
a
whole
another
situation
from
the
spring
involving
an
irrebuttable
presumption
in
a
civil
case.
i
take
it
that
the
rebuttable
presumption
in
this
case
is
one
not
lower
than
vlandis
against
kline.
but
you
will
notice
in
vlandis
the
court
holds
that
that
kind
of
an
irrebutabble
presumption
can
be
used
only
when
the
fact
would
follow
necessarily
and
uniformly
and
certainly
we
are
not
asking
for
that
much.
we
are
only
asking
that
the
judge
be
able
to
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
not
uniformly
and
exclusively.
now,
the
opinions
from
the
other
courts,
both
within
the
last
ten
years
and
over
a
hundred
year
span,
indicate
first
that
the
presumption
of
truthfulness
is
not
a
standard
exception
for
the
reasonable
doubt
standard.
it
has
never
been
simply
included
as
part
of
the
package.
secondly,
every
time
the
presumption
of
truthfulness
seems
to
raise
its
head
particularly
in
last
ten
years,
it
becomes
crushed.
now,
in
the
circuit
courts,
every
time
the
presumption
of
truthfulness
raises
its
head
the
court
seemed
to
crush
it
in
one
session
or
another.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
pardon.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
i
think
it
is
very
difficult
to
read
both
state
cases
and
circuit
cases
from
the
standpoint
of
whether
they
are
federal
constitutional
grounds
or
supervisory
or
in
the
state
cases,
whether
they
are
state
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
or
simply
error
of
our
federal
constitution.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
in
state
cases
you
have
three
choices,
i
guess.
but
in
reading
the
language
certainly
of
the
opinions
they
usually
talk
in
terms
of
presumption
of
innocence,
which
i
think
is
precisely
the
same
thing
as
a
burden
of
proof
being
on
the
government,
and
the
interference
with
the
prerogatives
of
the
jury
--
and
i
should
say
that
it
seems
to
me
that
in
three
of
the
circuit
cases,
the
one
we
are
arguing
today
in
addition
johnson
from
the
third
circuit
and
birmingham
from
the
tenth
circuit,
there
really
were
no
other
substantial
issues
involved.
obviously
all
of
the
rest
of
cases
as
all
cases
do
involve
a
number
of
issues
and
you
can’t
get
a
pure
case
every
time.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
well,
i
think
the
problem
is
still
there.
it's
obviously
much
more
irrational
to
presume
--
not
irrational,
unfair
and
unbalanced
to
presume
that
only
the
state's
witnesses
are
telling
the
truth.
i
think
it's
just
as
irrational
to
presume
that
the
defendant’s
witnesses
are
telling
the
truth.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
then
it's
of
course
--
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
then
it's
less
burdensome
for
the
defendant,
but
more
irrational,
because
witnesses
are
almost
contradictory
and
how
can
you
have
a
presumption
they
are
both
telling
the
truth?
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes.
it
can
be
overcome.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
no,
not
completely
at
large
at
all.
there
are
many
cases
in
which
--
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
well,
i
couldn’t
object
to
it.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
i
wouldn’t
ask
for
it
not
at
all.
now
they
must
feel
free
to
do
something.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
no,
i
know
of
no
cases
that
holds
that
the
jury
has
to
be
turned
loose
at
large.
and
there
are
many
cases
in
which
it
is
perfectly
permissible
even
for
the
judge
to
make
the
comment
that
in
his
mind
the
proof
has
been
made
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but,
in
every
case
like
that
i
have
seen
the
judge
goes
ahead
and
then
says,
but
now
you
don’t
have
to
take
my
words
for
it.
in
this
case
though
the
jury
has
told
that
you
must
find
the
(inaudible)
he
directs
you
to
find.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
well,
that's
why
i
reread
the
instruction
where
the
jury
has
told
what
a
presumption
is.
presumption
is
a
deduction
which
the
law
directs
expressly
to
be
made.
that
is
a
comment
on
the
evidence.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
no,
i
think
it
is
not
a
comment
in
the
sense
of
this
is
my
opinion,
take
it
or
leave
it
or
like
an
inference
instruction
is;
this
is
telling
the
jury
that
they
must
find
unless
it
is
rebutted.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes,
right
at
the
outset
of
the
instruction.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
you
would
think
so
at
first
if
you
only
read
that
--
this
is
a
problem
i
think
that
was
brought
up
in
the
cool
case
from
last
year.
how
do
you
read
jury
instructions?
do
you
parcel
them
out
or
you
read
them
all
together.
to
me,
we
have
to
read
them
together,
and
if
i
can
read
on
page
12
of
the
appendix,
it
says,
"the
jury
is
the
sole
and
exclusive
judges
of
the
facts
and
reliability."
it's
followed,
however,
by
a
sentence
which
says
that
the
jury’s
power
is
not
arbitrary
and
if
the
court
instructs
you
as
to
the
law
in
a
particular
subject
or
how
to
judge
the
evidence
you
must
follow
the
instructions.
and
so
they
are
saying,
you
are
the
exclusive
judges
so
long
as
you
follow
the
judge's
instructions,
and
the
instructions
are
that
you
must
find
them
to
be
the
truth.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
well
i
think
if
that
is
unconstitutional,
it's
probably
unconstitutional
under
the
jury
clause.
in
this
case
as
to
any
witness,
in
this
case
of
course
we
are
dealing
with
witness
who
in
fact
testified
on
behalf
of
the
state.
so,
that
places
the
burden
of
persuasion
--
well
there
is
no
burden
persuasion
then.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
you
must
believe.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
i
think
not
your
honor,
they
are
not
the
usual
ones.
there
is
nothing
here
about
things
on
the
nature
of
bias
or
motivation
that
they
can
take
into
account
absent
evidence.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes
as
a
matter
of
evidence,
but
you
see
that
shifts
the
burden
to
the
defendant
to
put
on
evidence,
and
in
a
criminal
case
the
defendant
has
no
obligation
to
either
put
on
evidence
as
it
relates
to
the
affirmative
case.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
that's
true,
that's
true,
it
can
be
done
by
cross-examination
and
there
was
a
certain
amount
here,
but
there
is
also
the
burden
of
persuasion,
and
you
maybe
able
to
get
the
evidence
on
by
the
states
on
witnesses.
in
other
words
that
simply
means
that
you
don’t
have
to
go
out
and
drum
up
witnesses.
but
the
state
still
has
burden
of
persuasion
that
was
--
that
the
facts
were
true.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
i
think
they
always
are.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
they
aren't
--
no
they
are
entitled
in
this
case
to
disbelieve
these
witnesses
and
all
of
them
if
the
defendant
persuades
them.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
i
think
that's
a
slide
over
statement
of
my
argument.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
they
were
all
entitled
to
disbelieve
them.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
the
problem
is
that
burden
of
persuasion
has
to
on
the
government.
now
the
only
time
the
burden
can
shift
to
the
defendant
is
after
the
government
has
carried
the
burden
on
almost
the
crime.
we
can
put
the
burden
on
the
defendant
to
prove
insanity,
excuse,
justification
in
various
defenses.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
that's
separate
clause
of
constitution,
your
honor.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
i
don’t
think
this
is
a
case
of
perjury,
your
honor,
perjury
was
mentioned
by
the
solicitor.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
truth
means
what
the
judge
had
said
it
means,
which
is
that
that's
what
the
jury
is
there
to
find
out,
is
the
truth,
and
truth
means
objective
truth
not
perjury
or
lying
versus
not
lying.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
i
think
that
would
--
i
wouldn't
object
to
it
except
that
it's
not
a
accurate
statement
of
the
law,
because
not
telling
the
truth
is
not
perjury,
perjury
is
a
deliberate
and
intentional
lying
on
the
material
facts.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes,
okay,
read
and
that's
fine,
but
you
see
that
is
not
what
they
are
being
told;
they
are
being
told
--
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes.
certainly
more
rationale.
if
a
person
takes
an
oath,
he
knows
that
he
must
conform
his
conduct
to
the
perjury
statutes,
but
there
is
nothing
about
taking
an
oath
that
improves
his
perception
or
his
memory
or
his
method
of
articulation,
and
that's
what
we
are
dealing
with
when
we
are
talking
about
telling
the
truth.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes
but
that
simply
makes
it
a
rebuttable
presumption
instead
of
an
irrebuttable
presumption,
of
course,
an
irrebuttable
presumption
would
be
worst,
but
the
problem
is
that
overcome
means
that
now
the
defendant
--
or
equal
means
that
now
the
defendant
must
carry
at
least
a
preponderance
burden.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
not
do
a
thing
in
terms
of
put
on
evidence.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
they
must
persuade
them
that
they
should
think
that
--
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
perhaps
that's
theoretically
true,
but
i
think
we
have
to
operate
under
the
rule
of
the
game
that
the
jury
will
comply
with
the
instructions
of
the
court
and
will
not
make
decisions
based
on
things
off
the
record.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes,
simply
because
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
persuade
the
jury
that
the
facts
are
true.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
if
they
believe
--
if
the
defendant
can
persuade
them
by
a
preponderance
that
the
witness
is
not
telling
a
truth
then
the
witness
can
be
disregarded.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes,
and
i
would
like
to
distinguish
that
from
i
think
it
was
--
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
i
don't
think
i
can
answer
that
from
my
own
experience,
your
honor.
but
i
would
like
to
distinguish
that
from
the
concept
of
a
permissive
situation
that
it
is
permissive
only
in
the
sense
that
the
judge
is
not
statutorily
commanded
to
give
the
instruction,
but
it's
not
permissive
in
the
sense
of
an
inference
as
opposed
to
a
presumption.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
other
comments.
one
is
that
for
the
life
of
me,
i
cannot
understand
what
interest
the
state
of
oregon
has
in
giving
this
instruction.
it
seems
to
me
they
don't
need
it,
it's
something
--
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
i
think
so,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
concept
of
due
process
and
the
burden
of
proof,
that
the
states
need
or
previous
cases
argued
today
talking
about
compelling
state
interest,
state
has
virtually
no
interest
at
all
in
having
this
instruction,
and
in
the
due
process
area,
i
think
the
state's
need
is
a
relevant
criterion.
now
as
far
as
the
harmless
error
doctrine
goes
--
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
it's
never
been
the
rule
in
ninth
circuit
and
--
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
well,
i
think
that's
the
law
under
chapman
and
harrington,
and
the
court,
the
ninth
circuit
is
simply
saying
that
the
state
has
not
carried
its
burden
of
showing
that
the
error
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
which
is
i
think
an
impossible
thing
to
do
in
any
event.
we
are
saying
that
if
we
apply
harmless
error
rule
and
i
am
taking
the
position,
of
course,
that
the
harmless
error
rule
cannot
apply
here,
you
are
saying
that
an
appellate
court
can
determine
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
if
the
jury
had
been
given
proper
reasonable
doubt
standard
they
would
have
convicted
anyway.
it's
quite
impossible
to
engraft
these
other
harmless
error
cases
into
this
one,
because
the
harmless
error
cases
ordinarily
involve
maybe
a
little
comment
that
the
defendant
didn't
take
the
stand
or
maybe
a
little
extra
illegal
heroine
introduced
into
a
drug
case.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
absolutely,
and
the
fact
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
does
not
mean
that
the
error
was
harmless,
because
you
can
stack
up
15
or
20
witnesses
and
if
you
presume
that
they
have
all
told
the
truth,
then
you
would
never
have
a
burden
on
the
state
and
any
case
would
be
harmless.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
well,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
distinction
that
we
made
between
just
enough
to
get
a
jury
and
--
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
no
i
think
the
only
relevant
point
is
what
if
the
juror
complied
with
the
instructions,
what
logical
steps
would
he
take
in
reaching
his
burden,
apart
from
the
quantity
or
the
quality
of
the
evidence.
although
i
would
point
out
that
we
are
--
accepting
the
state's
argument
on
harmless
error
that
it
could
be
harmless,
where
was
the
gun
10
minutes
after
the
robbery,
where
was
the
so-called
raincoat
the
robber
wore,
why
was
he
driving
the
car
and
there
were
two
other
people
in
the
car,
why
did
the
police
arrested
three
defendants
in
the
car
and
only
charged
one
with
the
crime?
it
seems
to
me
there
is
some
doubt
here
about
guilt
and
innocence
which
the
jury
might
have
considered,
if
they
were
not
require
the
believe
the
state's
witness.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
just
like
to
quote
a
couple
of
more
lines
from
the
instruction
to
be
with.
the
appendix,
page
15,
the
judge
instructs
the
jury
on
what
a
presumption
means.
a
presumption
is
a
deduction
which
the
law
expressly
directs
to
be
made
from
particular
facts
and
so
on.
and
then
proceeds
to
discuss
the
various
presumptions
involved
of
which
there
are
really
only
two,
this
truthfulness
presumption
and
so-called
the
presumption
of
innocence.
now,
it's
our
position
that
the
truthfulness
presumption
is
in
direct
contradiction
in
terms,
in
theory,
and
in
effect
to
the
constitutional
burden
of
proof.
the
burden
of
proof
means
--
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
it's
in
the
due
process
clause,
your
honor.
by
decision
of
this
court
and
several
others.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
no,
it's
not
expressed,
it's
not
expressed.
the
burden
of
proof
means
a
number
of
things.
it
can
mean
the
burden
of
pleading,
the
burden
of
proceeding
with
the
evidence,
the
burden
of
persuasion,
and
the
only
meaning
it
can
really
have
that
has
any
effect
is
the
burden
of
persuading
the
jury
of
the
truth
of
the
allegations.
and
so
by
saying
that
you
were
to
presume
that
whatever
these
witnesses
say
is
true,
seems
to
me
that's
in
direct
contradiction
to
the
concept
of
the
burden
of
proof
being
on
the
state.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
now
it
makes
a
big
difference.
i
think
the
position
of
the
state
seems
to
be
that
may
be
the
instruction
was
given
at
the
beginning,
because
perhaps
when
the
witness
first
gets
on
the
stand,
you
might
accord
him
certain
deference
that
he
will
not
either
lie
or
make
innocent
errors.
but,
now
we
are
dealing
with
a
situation
where
the
witnesses
have
already
testified
and
now
you
are
telling
the
jury
that
they
must
presume
that
these
witnesses
in
fact
have
testified
truthfully.
and
i
would
like
to
contrast
that
with
another
point
in
time
where
we
talk
about
the
truthfulness
of
witnesses
and
that's
on
appeal.
i
have
cited
innumerable
cases
where
the
comment
is
made
that
witnesses
should
be
presumed
to
have
told
the
truth.
and
here
we
are
doing
a
completely
difference
thing.
now,
we
are
looking
back
on
the
case
and
saying
was
there
sufficient
evidence
to
go
to
the
jury,
and
in
testing
the
sufficiency
of
evidence
of
course,
we
take
the
case
in
most
favorable
state
and
by
doing
that
we
presume
that
the
witnesses
did
tell
the
truth.
but,
that
only
gets
us
pass
the
question
of
whether
the
case
should
go
to
the
jury.
and
now
what
we
are
doing
in
this
case
is
what
state
is
saying,
the
judge
is
saying,
this
evidence
is
sufficient,
therefore
it
goes
to
the
jury,
and
secondly
you
must
presume
that
this
sufficient
evidence
is
in
fact
true.
and
it
seems
to
me
then
that
there
is
really
no
difference
at
all
between
the
sufficiency
of
evidence
rule
which
may
simply
mean
that
there
is
some
evidence
and
the
rule
that
the
burden
of
persuasion
lies
with
the
state.
it
seems
to
me
they
are
hopelessly
confused
by
this
instruction.
but,
i
would
say
that
if
the
instruction
were
given
at
the
outset,
it
certainly
would
make
more
sense.
now,
it's
inescapable,
we
have
to
talk
about
presumption
and
inference
cases.
i
am
taking
the
position,
of
course,
that
this
is
not
really
a
true
presumption
at
all
because
a
presumption
is
a
situation
where
you
have
a
fact
proved
and
the
jury
has
told
that
from
that
they
should
deduce
a
second
fact.
in
this
case
it
seems
to
me
there
is
no
proved
fact.
but,
i
think
it's
important
to
distinguish
the
line
of
cases
in
this
court,
the
most
recent
one
being
barnes
from
the
spring,
working
all
the
way
back
through
gainy,
romano,
todd,
bowen,
black
and
so
on.
firstly
all
of
which
it
seems
to
me
involve
inferences.
in
other
words,
the
jury
has
told,
you
may
if
you
wish
link
these
two
facts
together
in
your
minds.
in
this
case
the
jury
has
told
you
are
expressly
directed
to
link
these
two
facts
in
your
minds.
now,
the
reformulation
of
the
inference
rule
in
barnes
seems
to
be
that
the
judge
may
instruct
on
an
inference,
if
a
rational
juror
--
this
is
not
in
my
brief,
because
i
think
that
was
decided
about
the
time
i
was
in
printer’s
office.
if
a
rational
juror
would
be
able
to
link
the
two
facts
and
find
that
the
presumed
fact
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt.
but,
that's
in
a
mere
inference.
here
we
are
telling
the
jury
that
you
must
find.
and
in
that
case
it
seems
to
me
that
judge
can
give
the
instruction
only
if
a
judge
himself
would
find
that
the
facts
are
linked
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
because
the
jury
has
no
option
at
all.
they
must
find
this
fact
to
be
true.
and
if
i
can
make
a
comment
about
vlandis
against
kline
which
is
a
whole
another
situation
from
the
spring
involving
an
irrebuttable
presumption
in
a
civil
case.
i
take
it
that
the
rebuttable
presumption
in
this
case
is
one
not
lower
than
vlandis
against
kline.
but
you
will
notice
in
vlandis
the
court
holds
that
that
kind
of
an
irrebutabble
presumption
can
be
used
only
when
the
fact
would
follow
necessarily
and
uniformly
and
certainly
we
are
not
asking
for
that
much.
we
are
only
asking
that
the
judge
be
able
to
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
not
uniformly
and
exclusively.
now,
the
opinions
from
the
other
courts,
both
within
the
last
ten
years
and
over
a
hundred
year
span,
indicate
first
that
the
presumption
of
truthfulness
is
not
a
standard
exception
for
the
reasonable
doubt
standard.
it
has
never
been
simply
included
as
part
of
the
package.
secondly,
every
time
the
presumption
of
truthfulness
seems
to
raise
its
head
particularly
in
last
ten
years,
it
becomes
crushed.
now,
in
the
circuit
courts,
every
time
the
presumption
of
truthfulness
raises
its
head
the
court
seemed
to
crush
it
in
one
session
or
another.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
pardon.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
i
think
it
is
very
difficult
to
read
both
state
cases
and
circuit
cases
from
the
standpoint
of
whether
they
are
federal
constitutional
grounds
or
supervisory
or
in
the
state
cases,
whether
they
are
state
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
or
simply
error
of
our
federal
constitution.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
in
state
cases
you
have
three
choices,
i
guess.
but
in
reading
the
language
certainly
of
the
opinions
they
usually
talk
in
terms
of
presumption
of
innocence,
which
i
think
is
precisely
the
same
thing
as
a
burden
of
proof
being
on
the
government,
and
the
interference
with
the
prerogatives
of
the
jury
--
and
i
should
say
that
it
seems
to
me
that
in
three
of
the
circuit
cases,
the
one
we
are
arguing
today
in
addition
johnson
from
the
third
circuit
and
birmingham
from
the
tenth
circuit,
there
really
were
no
other
substantial
issues
involved.
obviously
all
of
the
rest
of
cases
as
all
cases
do
involve
a
number
of
issues
and
you
can’t
get
a
pure
case
every
time.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
well,
i
think
the
problem
is
still
there.
it's
obviously
much
more
irrational
to
presume
--
not
irrational,
unfair
and
unbalanced
to
presume
that
only
the
state's
witnesses
are
telling
the
truth.
i
think
it's
just
as
irrational
to
presume
that
the
defendant’s
witnesses
are
telling
the
truth.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
then
it's
of
course
--
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
then
it's
less
burdensome
for
the
defendant,
but
more
irrational,
because
witnesses
are
almost
contradictory
and
how
can
you
have
a
presumption
they
are
both
telling
the
truth?
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes.
it
can
be
overcome.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
no,
not
completely
at
large
at
all.
there
are
many
cases
in
which
--
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
well,
i
couldn’t
object
to
it.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
i
wouldn’t
ask
for
it
not
at
all.
now
they
must
feel
free
to
do
something.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
no,
i
know
of
no
cases
that
holds
that
the
jury
has
to
be
turned
loose
at
large.
and
there
are
many
cases
in
which
it
is
perfectly
permissible
even
for
the
judge
to
make
the
comment
that
in
his
mind
the
proof
has
been
made
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
but,
in
every
case
like
that
i
have
seen
the
judge
goes
ahead
and
then
says,
but
now
you
don’t
have
to
take
my
words
for
it.
in
this
case
though
the
jury
has
told
that
you
must
find
the
(inaudible)
he
directs
you
to
find.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
well,
that's
why
i
reread
the
instruction
where
the
jury
has
told
what
a
presumption
is.
presumption
is
a
deduction
which
the
law
directs
expressly
to
be
made.
that
is
a
comment
on
the
evidence.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
no,
i
think
it
is
not
a
comment
in
the
sense
of
this
is
my
opinion,
take
it
or
leave
it
or
like
an
inference
instruction
is;
this
is
telling
the
jury
that
they
must
find
unless
it
is
rebutted.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes,
right
at
the
outset
of
the
instruction.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
you
would
think
so
at
first
if
you
only
read
that
--
this
is
a
problem
i
think
that
was
brought
up
in
the
cool
case
from
last
year.
how
do
you
read
jury
instructions?
do
you
parcel
them
out
or
you
read
them
all
together.
to
me,
we
have
to
read
them
together,
and
if
i
can
read
on
page
12
of
the
appendix,
it
says,
"the
jury
is
the
sole
and
exclusive
judges
of
the
facts
and
reliability."
it's
followed,
however,
by
a
sentence
which
says
that
the
jury’s
power
is
not
arbitrary
and
if
the
court
instructs
you
as
to
the
law
in
a
particular
subject
or
how
to
judge
the
evidence
you
must
follow
the
instructions.
and
so
they
are
saying,
you
are
the
exclusive
judges
so
long
as
you
follow
the
judge's
instructions,
and
the
instructions
are
that
you
must
find
them
to
be
the
truth.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
well
i
think
if
that
is
unconstitutional,
it's
probably
unconstitutional
under
the
jury
clause.
in
this
case
as
to
any
witness,
in
this
case
of
course
we
are
dealing
with
witness
who
in
fact
testified
on
behalf
of
the
state.
so,
that
places
the
burden
of
persuasion
--
well
there
is
no
burden
persuasion
then.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
you
must
believe.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
i
think
not
your
honor,
they
are
not
the
usual
ones.
there
is
nothing
here
about
things
on
the
nature
of
bias
or
motivation
that
they
can
take
into
account
absent
evidence.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes
as
a
matter
of
evidence,
but
you
see
that
shifts
the
burden
to
the
defendant
to
put
on
evidence,
and
in
a
criminal
case
the
defendant
has
no
obligation
to
either
put
on
evidence
as
it
relates
to
the
affirmative
case.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
that's
true,
that's
true,
it
can
be
done
by
cross-examination
and
there
was
a
certain
amount
here,
but
there
is
also
the
burden
of
persuasion,
and
you
maybe
able
to
get
the
evidence
on
by
the
states
on
witnesses.
in
other
words
that
simply
means
that
you
don’t
have
to
go
out
and
drum
up
witnesses.
but
the
state
still
has
burden
of
persuasion
that
was
--
that
the
facts
were
true.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
i
think
they
always
are.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
they
aren't
--
no
they
are
entitled
in
this
case
to
disbelieve
these
witnesses
and
all
of
them
if
the
defendant
persuades
them.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
i
think
that's
a
slide
over
statement
of
my
argument.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
they
were
all
entitled
to
disbelieve
them.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
the
problem
is
that
burden
of
persuasion
has
to
on
the
government.
now
the
only
time
the
burden
can
shift
to
the
defendant
is
after
the
government
has
carried
the
burden
on
almost
the
crime.
we
can
put
the
burden
on
the
defendant
to
prove
insanity,
excuse,
justification
in
various
defenses.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
that's
separate
clause
of
constitution,
your
honor.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
i
don’t
think
this
is
a
case
of
perjury,
your
honor,
perjury
was
mentioned
by
the
solicitor.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
truth
means
what
the
judge
had
said
it
means,
which
is
that
that's
what
the
jury
is
there
to
find
out,
is
the
truth,
and
truth
means
objective
truth
not
perjury
or
lying
versus
not
lying.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
i
think
that
would
--
i
wouldn't
object
to
it
except
that
it's
not
a
accurate
statement
of
the
law,
because
not
telling
the
truth
is
not
perjury,
perjury
is
a
deliberate
and
intentional
lying
on
the
material
facts.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes,
okay,
read
and
that's
fine,
but
you
see
that
is
not
what
they
are
being
told;
they
are
being
told
--
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes.
certainly
more
rationale.
if
a
person
takes
an
oath,
he
knows
that
he
must
conform
his
conduct
to
the
perjury
statutes,
but
there
is
nothing
about
taking
an
oath
that
improves
his
perception
or
his
memory
or
his
method
of
articulation,
and
that's
what
we
are
dealing
with
when
we
are
talking
about
telling
the
truth.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes
but
that
simply
makes
it
a
rebuttable
presumption
instead
of
an
irrebuttable
presumption,
of
course,
an
irrebuttable
presumption
would
be
worst,
but
the
problem
is
that
overcome
means
that
now
the
defendant
--
or
equal
means
that
now
the
defendant
must
carry
at
least
a
preponderance
burden.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
not
do
a
thing
in
terms
of
put
on
evidence.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
they
must
persuade
them
that
they
should
think
that
--
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
perhaps
that's
theoretically
true,
but
i
think
we
have
to
operate
under
the
rule
of
the
game
that
the
jury
will
comply
with
the
instructions
of
the
court
and
will
not
make
decisions
based
on
things
off
the
record.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes,
simply
because
the
burden
is
on
the
government
to
persuade
the
jury
that
the
facts
are
true.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
if
they
believe
--
if
the
defendant
can
persuade
them
by
a
preponderance
that
the
witness
is
not
telling
a
truth
then
the
witness
can
be
disregarded.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes,
and
i
would
like
to
distinguish
that
from
i
think
it
was
--
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
yes.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
i
don't
think
i
can
answer
that
from
my
own
experience,
your
honor.
but
i
would
like
to
distinguish
that
from
the
concept
of
a
permissive
situation
that
it
is
permissive
only
in
the
sense
that
the
judge
is
not
statutorily
commanded
to
give
the
instruction,
but
it's
not
permissive
in
the
sense
of
an
inference
as
opposed
to
a
presumption.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
of
other
comments.
one
is
that
for
the
life
of
me,
i
cannot
understand
what
interest
the
state
of
oregon
has
in
giving
this
instruction.
it
seems
to
me
they
don't
need
it,
it's
something
--
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
i
think
so,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
when
we
are
dealing
with
concept
of
due
process
and
the
burden
of
proof,
that
the
states
need
or
previous
cases
argued
today
talking
about
compelling
state
interest,
state
has
virtually
no
interest
at
all
in
having
this
instruction,
and
in
the
due
process
area,
i
think
the
state's
need
is
a
relevant
criterion.
now
as
far
as
the
harmless
error
doctrine
goes
--
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
it's
never
been
the
rule
in
ninth
circuit
and
--
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
well,
i
think
that's
the
law
under
chapman
and
harrington,
and
the
court,
the
ninth
circuit
is
simply
saying
that
the
state
has
not
carried
its
burden
of
showing
that
the
error
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
which
is
i
think
an
impossible
thing
to
do
in
any
event.
we
are
saying
that
if
we
apply
harmless
error
rule
and
i
am
taking
the
position,
of
course,
that
the
harmless
error
rule
cannot
apply
here,
you
are
saying
that
an
appellate
court
can
determine
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
if
the
jury
had
been
given
proper
reasonable
doubt
standard
they
would
have
convicted
anyway.
it's
quite
impossible
to
engraft
these
other
harmless
error
cases
into
this
one,
because
the
harmless
error
cases
ordinarily
involve
maybe
a
little
comment
that
the
defendant
didn't
take
the
stand
or
maybe
a
little
extra
illegal
heroine
introduced
into
a
drug
case.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
absolutely,
and
the
fact
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
does
not
mean
that
the
error
was
harmless,
because
you
can
stack
up
15
or
20
witnesses
and
if
you
presume
that
they
have
all
told
the
truth,
then
you
would
never
have
a
burden
on
the
state
and
any
case
would
be
harmless.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
well,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
distinction
that
we
made
between
just
enough
to
get
a
jury
and
--
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
no
i
think
the
only
relevant
point
is
what
if
the
juror
complied
with
the
instructions,
what
logical
steps
would
he
take
in
reaching
his
burden,
apart
from
the
quantity
or
the
quality
of
the
evidence.
although
i
would
point
out
that
we
are
--
accepting
the
state's
argument
on
harmless
error
that
it
could
be
harmless,
where
was
the
gun
10
minutes
after
the
robbery,
where
was
the
so-called
raincoat
the
robber
wore,
why
was
he
driving
the
car
and
there
were
two
other
people
in
the
car,
why
did
the
police
arrested
three
defendants
in
the
car
and
only
charged
one
with
the
crime?
it
seems
to
me
there
is
some
doubt
here
about
guilt
and
innocence
which
the
jury
might
have
considered,
if
they
were
not
require
the
believe
the
state's
witness.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
ross
r.
runkel
thank
you
your
honor.
