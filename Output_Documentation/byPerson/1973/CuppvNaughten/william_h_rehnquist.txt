but
he
did
not
qualify
it
by
saying
the
manner
of
testifying
might
be
taken
in
to
consideration
or
the
contradiction
--
he
gave
the
usual
kind
of
qualifications
you
would
expect.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
this
mr.
runkel,
where
it
says
every
witness
is
presumed
to
speak
the
truth
on
page
16
of
appendix,
then
it
says
this
presumption
may
be
overcome
by
the
manner
in
which
the
witness
testifies,
by
the
nature
of
his
of
her
testimony,
by
evidence
effecting
his
or
her
character
interest
or
motive.
now
wouldn't
that
include
bias?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
he
can
--
certainly
you
can
show
that
the
prosecution
witness
is
biased
by
cross-examination
without
bringing
any
witness
of
your
own.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
respondent
naughten
was
convicted
in
an
oregon
state
court
for
the
crime
of
armed
robbery,
and
his
conviction
was
upheld
by
the
oregon
appellate
court.
he
then
sought
federal
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
oregon,
was
turned
on.
he
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
prevailed
there.
that
court
found
that
a
so-called
presumption
of
truthfulness
instruction,
given
at
respondent’s
trial,
had
the
affect
of
shifting
the
burden
of
proof
from
the
state
to
him
and
denied
him
a
fair
trial
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
instruction
in
question
read
as
follows:
“every
witness
is
presumed
to
speak
the
truth.
this
presumption
may
be
overcome
by
the
manner
in
which
the
witness
testifies,
by
the
nature
of
his
or
her
testimony,
by
evidence
affecting
his
or
her
character,
interest,
or
motives,
by
contradictory
evidence,
or
by
a
presumption.”
along
with
this
instruction,
the
trial
court
gave
lengthy
instructions,
telling
the
jury
that
the
burden
was
on
the
state
to
prove
respondent’s
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
the
respondent
was
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
presumption
of
innocence.
the
court
of
appeals
placed
a
good
deal
of
reliance
on
the
fact
that
a
large
number
of
federal
courts
of
appeals
have
disapproved
this
instruction
when
given
by
a
federal
district
court
in
a
federal
trial.
we
do
not
attach
the
same
weight
to
this
fact
or
as
did
the
court
of
appeals.
these
courts
of
appeals
have
supervisory
authority
over
the
federal
district
courts
within
their
jurisdictions.
they
have
a
good
deal
of
latitude
to
condemn
jury
instructions
given
by
those
courts
and
to
reverse
convictions
resulting
from
trials
in
which
those
instructions
have
been
given.
but
a
federal
habeas
court,
reviewing
a
state
conviction,
may
grant
relief
only
if
the
asserted
errors
of
constitutional
dimension.
we
conclude
that
whatever
maybe
the
shortcomings
of
this
instruction
the
abstract,
when
read
in
the
context
of
the
other
instructions
given
by
the
trial
court,
it
neither
shifted
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
respondent,
no
water
down
the
state’s
burden
of
proving
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
