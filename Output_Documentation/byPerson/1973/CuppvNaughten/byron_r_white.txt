justice

white
in
general
--
it's
sort
of
a
general
instruction
about
the
credibility
of
witnesses
and
how
the
jury
is
to
approach
whether
to
believe
a
witness
or
not.
and
you
say
that
the
state
must
leave
the
--
the
instructions
must
leave
the
jury
completely
at
large
on
that
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
you
wouldn't
insist
that
they
say
that
the
state
witnesses
presume
not
to
tell
the
truth.
you
wouldn’t
insist
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
you
wouldnt
insist
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
are
they
supposed
to
--
they
are
supposed
to
be
left
completely
in
neutral.
justice
byron
r.
white
to
presume.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
it's
a
comment
on
how
the
jury
is
--
whether
jury
is
to
believe
witness
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
unconstitutional
view
to
instruct
the
jury
that
they
must
believe
a
witness
unless
he
is
contradicted
or
un-contradicted
evidence
must
be
believed
by
the
jury.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
then,
in
effect
--
the
judge
in
effect
told
the
jury
the
witnesses
you
have
heard
you
should
believe.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
to
me
all
this
did
was
to
disentitle
the
jury
to
disbelieve
evidence
that
isn't
contradicted.
sometimes
juries
are
free
to
disbelieve
the
only
witness
in
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well
they
aren't
here.
you
say
they
aren't
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
in
this
case
where
there
weren't
any
other
witnesses
on
the
defendant
side.
in
this
case
you
say
the
jury
wasn't
free
to
disbelieve
the
government’s
witnesses.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
what's
wrong
with
it,
if
they
are
all
free
to
disbelieve
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
but
the
jury
--
under
that
lays
a
jury
on
its
own
motion
and
its
own
mind
could
say
this
fellow
testified
in
such
a
manner
that
we
don’t
believe
him
without
defendant
having
to
do
a
thing.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
or
even
argue
--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
jury
has
already
made
up
his
mind
set.
the
jury
may
decide,
it
doesn't
believe
him
because
of
the
manner
he
tesitfied.
