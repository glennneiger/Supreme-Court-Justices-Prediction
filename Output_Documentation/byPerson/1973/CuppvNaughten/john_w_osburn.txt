mr.
john
w.
osburn
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
sophisticated
legal
issue
which
is
before
the
court
in
this
case
involving
the
presumption
of
witness
truthfulness
is
an
interesting
contrast
to
the
factual
situation
which
gave
rise
to
the
case
and
upon
which
the
state
court
trial
jury
was
called
upon
to
deliberate.
the
respondent
naughten
was
convicted
in
state
trial
court
of
the
crime
of
armed
robbery
involving
the
robbery
of
a
late
night
pore
(ph)
and
a
friend
of
his
who
were
in
the
store
about
mid
night.
one
night
the
proprietor
was
locking
the
place
up
and
getting
ready
to
close
and
just
before
he
locked
the
place,
a
man
came
in
who
witness
later
identified
as
the
respondent
naughten
and
brandished
the
pistol
and
informed
mr.
livengood
according
to
livengood's
testimony
that
this
was
stick
up
and
he
then
forced
the
proprietor
and
the
friend
into
the
cooler
and
told
them
to
wait
there
until
he
was
finished.
then
the
two
men
were
sitting
in
the
cooler
and
the
friend
said
to
the
proprietor,
“well,
i
think
they
are
gone
now”,
and
so
the
proprietor
went
out
and
the
robber
had
not
gone
and
forced
him
again
back
into
the
cooler.
then
a
short
time
later
the
friend
again
suggest
that
the
robber
was
gone
by
this
time
and
they
came
out
and
proprietor
called
the
police.
the
police
arrived
fairly
immediately
and
it
turned
out
that
mr.
naughten's
car
had
been
parked
across
the
street
in
a
tavern
parking
lot.
the
police
arrived
and
the
proprietor,
mr.
livengood
identified
the
respondent
naughten
as
being
the
robber.
there
was
no
line
up
or
there
were
no
wade-gilbert
problems,
no
problems
of
undue
suggestibility.
both,
the
proprietor
and
the
witness
had
seen
mr.
naughten
for
approximately
a
period
of
15
minutes,
most
of
which
they
were
in
his
presence,
some
part
of
which
they
were
back
in
the
cooler.
there
was
also
a
testimony
by
two
police
officers,
one
who
testified
that
he
came
in
and
mr.
livengood
had
identified
naughten
as
the
robber,
and
there
was
also
testimony
that
at
the
time
that
naughten
was
handcuffed
with
his
hands
behind
him
that
he
was
attempting
to
stuff
some
money
into
the
crack
between
the
seat
of
the
automobile,
this
money
was
later
retrieved
by
the
police
and
this
essentially
was
the
testimony
that
was
presented
at
the
trial.
the
defendant's
cross-examination
consisted
primarily,
the
cross-examination
consisted
primarily
of
asking
the
two
eyewitnesses
about
when
they
talked
about
the
case,
asking
about
why
was
that
the
man
who
was
arrested,
who
was
identified
as
naughten,
why
it
was
that
he
did
not
have
a
pistol.
and
the
defendant
didn't
present
testimony,
didnt'
call
any
witnesses,
and
the
case
went
to
the
jury
then
with
the
court's
instructions.
now
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
that
it
was
the
state's
burden
to
prove
guilt
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
instructed
the
jury
that
the
defendant
was
presumed
to
be
innocent
and
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
of
guilty.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
this
is
the
reason
why
we
tried
to
present
it
in
this
fashion,
because
it
seems
to
us
that
on
those
facts
and
given
the
instructions
which
the
court
gave
clearly
instructed
on
burden
of
proof,
clearly
instructed
on
presumption
of
innocence,
that
it's
just
inconceivable
to
me
that
a
lay
jury
could
have
taken
that
instruction
about
witnesses
being
presumed
to
speak
the
truth
and
could
have
turned
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
into
an
instruction
which
did
just
the
opposite,
which
placed
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant,
and
this
is
particularly
true
in
this
case
because
of
what
occurred
at
the
time
that
the
jury
had
received
its
instruction
and
counsel
took
his
exceptions
to
the
instructions.
at
the
time
that
their
prepared
instruction
were
given
the
court
and
defense
counsel,
the
prosecutor
and
the
defendant,
in
court
report,
all
went
in
to
the
court's
chambers
and
they
then
considered
whether
or
not
there
were
exceptions
to
the
instructions
and
the
counsel
did
take
some,
and
one
of
the
instructions
which
he
requested,
which
he
had
an
answer
for
was
an
instruction
on
that
the
jury
was
not
to
infer
guilt
from
the
fact
that
the
defendant
didn't
take
the
stand.
this
is
what
this
instruction
--
of
course,
there
is
considerable
disagreement
among
defense
counsel
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
grid
instruction
or
not,
some
counsel
preferred
--
some
consider
that
the
instruction
is
in
the
words
of
the
ninth
circuit
"don't
put
the
jelly
bean
in
your
nose"
instruction,
because
it
simply
caused
attention
to
something
that
the
jury
might
otherwise
have
overlooked.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
yes.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
well
we
think
that
it
comes
before
the
court
in
two
ways
and
maybe
these
are
subtle
statements
of
the
same
principle.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
yes.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
yes,
we
have
raised
both
of
those
issues.
the
first
way
of
stating
it
is
this,
that
the
instruction
itself,
while
it
does
present
a
colorable
constitutional
issue,
because
it's
been
discussed
in
the
various
circuits,
in
a
constitutional
context,
and
the
courts
have
generally
not
given
good
marks
to
this
instruction,
that
our
position
is,
it's
just
not
that
bad,
that
it
should
result
in
the
reversal
in
federal
habeas
corpus
of
a
jury
verdict
on
these
facts.
that
it's
just
inconceivable
that
on
the
facts
of
the
case
and
given
the
clear
precise
instructions
that
the
court
gave
that
a
jury
could
possibly
have
even
understood
what
the
legal
issue
was
all
about.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
yes.
now,
they
also
found
that
none
of
other
instructions
which
the
trial
judge
had
given
specifically
obviated
the
problem
that
is
involved
in
this
instruction.
well,
we
think
that
it
did
because
the
jury
was
called
back
or
rather
the
court
and
parties
went
back
into
the
courtroom
and
after
the
jury
has
been
sitting
there
and
they
are
called
back
into
the
courtroom
and
court
again
gave
them
some
instruction
which
says
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
defendant
and
that
--
mr.
john
w.
osburn
pardon
me,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
state,
that
the
state
must
prove
its
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
the
defendant
is
presumed
to
be
innocent.
now
we
certainly
recognized
that
it's
fundamental
to
our
law
that
a
guilt
of
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it's
not
quite
so
clear
that
an
instruction
must
be
given
to
a
state
tourt
trial
jury
that
the
defendant
is
presumed
to
be
innocent.
nevertheless
that
is
an
instruction
which
is
always
given
under
our
state
law
and
which
was
given
in
this
case.
now,
then
the
question
is
what
is
there
about
the
presumption
instruction
that
suddenly
shifts
the
burden
to
the
defendant,
even
though
the
court
said
time
and
again
that
the
defendant
had
no
burden.
well,
the
argument
goes
that
where
the
defendant
does
not
testify
and
where
the
defendant
does
not
present
any
evidence
or
call
any
witnesses,
that
the
instruction
really
amounts
to
a
presumption
of
that
witnesses
who
are
called
by
the
state
have
told
the
truth.
because
the
instruction
is
expressed
in
terms
of
a
rebuttable
presumption,
every
witness
is
presumed
to
speak
the
truth,
says
the
instruction.
this
presumption
may
be
overcome
by
the
manner
in
which
the
witness
testifies,
by
the
nature
of
his
or
her
testimony,
by
evidence
affecting
his
or
her
character,
interest
or
motives,
by
contradictory
evidence
or
by
a
presumption.
now,
the
instruction
says
in
its
very
words
that
while
the
witness
is
presumed
to
speak
the
truth,
that
the
witness
himself
may
overcome
that
presumption.
the
presumption
may
be
overcome
by
the
manner
in
which
the
witness
testifies,
by
the
nature
of
his
testimony.
the
jury
was
again
told
at
later
place
in
the
instructions
that
you
are
not
bound
to
find
in
conformity
with
the
testimony
of
the
declarations
of
any
number
of
witnesses
which
do
not
produce
belief
in
your
minds.
now
we
have
tried
as
is
our
lawyerly
duty
in
the
brief
to
explain
why
the
instruction
is
given,
to
explain
what
it
is
intended
to
convey,
and
i
think
essentially
it
simply
intended
to
convey
the
impression
to
the
jury
that
the
jury
is
there
to
hear
the
testimony,
they
are
there
to
hear
to
witnesses.
they
may
begin
with
a
presumption
that
a
person
who
is
sworn
on
oath,
is
not
going
to
commit
perjury
and
until
there
is
something
that
occurs,
something
about
the
way
the
witness
testifies,
something
about
the
way
he
looks
or
the
nature
of
what
he
says
that
convinces
a
person
that
he
is
not
telling
the
truth.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
yes.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
this
instruction
was
given
for
many
years.
it
has
been
part
of
the
standard
form
instructions.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
yes.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
i
have
had
an
occasion
to
speak
to
judicial
conferences,
of
course,
and
i
have
been
discouraged
to
give
any
of
the
instruction.
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
says
it's
not,
or
if
you
give
it,
but
that
doesn’t
mean
it
that
it
has
to
be
given
and
so
we
have
discouraged
its
use.
but,
it
has
generally
been
given.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
yes.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
well,
this
is
an
instruction
that
has
been
given
for
about
a
hundred
years
and
it
is
only
in
the
last
few
years,
in
fact
this
is
the
first
known
case
in
which
anybody
has
challenged
the
instruction.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
i
don’t
see
any
difference
in
this
instruction.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
i
don’t
see
any
difference.
the
manner
of
evaluating
when
a
person
gets
on
the
stand,
the
manner
of
how
you
start
out
looking
at
it,
whether
or
not
you
say
to
yourself,
alright,
this
is
a
person
who
is
called
who
presumably
knows
something
about
the
case,
and
presumably
is
going
to
tell
the
truth.
that
applies
across
the
board
to
all
witnesses.
now,
we
do
mention
in
the
brief,
of
course,
that
witnesses
to
a
case
are
chosen
not
by
the
parties.
these
aren’t
the
prosecution’s
witnesses;
these
are
the
people
who
were
there.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
they
are
the
prosecution’s
witnesses
only
in
the
sense
that
the
prosecution
has
chosen
to
call
them.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
well
we
have
a
rule
of
course
as
a
matter
of
state
practice
that
you
can’t
impeach
your
own
witness
by
evidence
of
bad
character
or
something
else.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
exactly.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
right.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
yes.
i
thought
that
was
referred
to
in
the
respondent’s
--
mr.
john
w.
osburn
well,
of
course,
mathes's
instructions
are
federal
instructions
and
our
state
courts
as
the
most
state
court
have
their
own
uniform
jury
instructions.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
well
it's
unusual
and
that
i
think
as
we
indicated
judge
mathes
was
a
california
trial
judge
and
when
he
had
the
opportunity
to
prepare
the
uniform
jury
instructions,
he
put
that
in,
apparently
because
of
his
california
background,
and
it
immediately
met
with
disfavor
by
practically
every
circuit.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
there
are
cases
--
many
of
the
cases
which,
of
course,
are
federal
prosecutions,
do
speak
in
terms
of
constitutional
infirmity,
but
they
are
talking
in
a
context
in
which
they
don’t
have
to
put
it
on
constitutional
grounds,
because
the
court
of
appeals,
of
course,
are
free
to
suggest
that
the
instruction
is
a
poor
one,
which
it
well
may
be.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
yes.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
yes.
and
as
we
indicate
there
is
only
one
case
of
the
--
nearly
the
cases
that
have
disapproved
the
instruction
in
which,
like
this
case,
that's
the
only
issue
that's
raised.
normally
there
has
been
some
other
problem,
a
problem
of
failure
to
give
an
accomplished
instruction
or
something
like
this,
but
our
concern
here
is
and
if
the
reason
for
requesting
this
court
to
review
the
case
is
that
of
course
there
is
a
constitutional
colorable
question
presented
here,
of
course
we
recognize
that.
our
concern
is
though
that
there
must
be
some
point
at
which
we
say
that
although
a
colorable
constitutional
issue
is
presented
that
the
constitutional
--
the
problem
is
really
not
one
of
constitutional
magnitude,
such
as
to
justify
overturning
the
decision
of
the
jury
and
requiring
the
defendant
to
be
tried
anew.
i
think
basically
that
states
our
position.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
just
briefly
your
honor.
we
assume
i
think
as
lawyers
that
the
words
that
we
say
in
a
courtroom
are
hung
on
by
the
jury
and
that
they
attach
great
significance
to
them,
and
we
have
talked
now
both
in
briefs
and
in
oral
argument
about
this
instruction.
remember
this
is
an
instruction
that
went
to
the
jury
in
about
15
seconds
and
they
heard
that
middle
of
all
kinds
of
other
instructions
about
other
things.
we
ask
a
great
deal
of
jurors.
we
bring
people
in
who
are
cab
drivers
and
housewives.
we
sit
them
down
in
a
courtroom
and
we
parade
witnesses
in
front
of
them
and
then
ask
people
to
make
a
decision.
we
think
the
fact
finding
system
here
was
fair
that
the
adequate
evidence
was
presented,
and
that
there
was
nothing
essentially
wrong
with
the
standard
which
was
employed
by
the
court,
that
instruction
is
not
a
model
but
it's
just
not
that
bad.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
sophisticated
legal
issue
which
is
before
the
court
in
this
case
involving
the
presumption
of
witness
truthfulness
is
an
interesting
contrast
to
the
factual
situation
which
gave
rise
to
the
case
and
upon
which
the
state
court
trial
jury
was
called
upon
to
deliberate.
the
respondent
naughten
was
convicted
in
state
trial
court
of
the
crime
of
armed
robbery
involving
the
robbery
of
a
late
night
pore
(ph)
and
a
friend
of
his
who
were
in
the
store
about
mid
night.
one
night
the
proprietor
was
locking
the
place
up
and
getting
ready
to
close
and
just
before
he
locked
the
place,
a
man
came
in
who
witness
later
identified
as
the
respondent
naughten
and
brandished
the
pistol
and
informed
mr.
livengood
according
to
livengood's
testimony
that
this
was
stick
up
and
he
then
forced
the
proprietor
and
the
friend
into
the
cooler
and
told
them
to
wait
there
until
he
was
finished.
then
the
two
men
were
sitting
in
the
cooler
and
the
friend
said
to
the
proprietor,
“well,
i
think
they
are
gone
now”,
and
so
the
proprietor
went
out
and
the
robber
had
not
gone
and
forced
him
again
back
into
the
cooler.
then
a
short
time
later
the
friend
again
suggest
that
the
robber
was
gone
by
this
time
and
they
came
out
and
proprietor
called
the
police.
the
police
arrived
fairly
immediately
and
it
turned
out
that
mr.
naughten's
car
had
been
parked
across
the
street
in
a
tavern
parking
lot.
the
police
arrived
and
the
proprietor,
mr.
livengood
identified
the
respondent
naughten
as
being
the
robber.
there
was
no
line
up
or
there
were
no
wade-gilbert
problems,
no
problems
of
undue
suggestibility.
both,
the
proprietor
and
the
witness
had
seen
mr.
naughten
for
approximately
a
period
of
15
minutes,
most
of
which
they
were
in
his
presence,
some
part
of
which
they
were
back
in
the
cooler.
there
was
also
a
testimony
by
two
police
officers,
one
who
testified
that
he
came
in
and
mr.
livengood
had
identified
naughten
as
the
robber,
and
there
was
also
testimony
that
at
the
time
that
naughten
was
handcuffed
with
his
hands
behind
him
that
he
was
attempting
to
stuff
some
money
into
the
crack
between
the
seat
of
the
automobile,
this
money
was
later
retrieved
by
the
police
and
this
essentially
was
the
testimony
that
was
presented
at
the
trial.
the
defendant's
cross-examination
consisted
primarily,
the
cross-examination
consisted
primarily
of
asking
the
two
eyewitnesses
about
when
they
talked
about
the
case,
asking
about
why
was
that
the
man
who
was
arrested,
who
was
identified
as
naughten,
why
it
was
that
he
did
not
have
a
pistol.
and
the
defendant
didn't
present
testimony,
didnt'
call
any
witnesses,
and
the
case
went
to
the
jury
then
with
the
court's
instructions.
now
the
trial
court
instructed
the
jury
that
it
was
the
state's
burden
to
prove
guilt
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt,
instructed
the
jury
that
the
defendant
was
presumed
to
be
innocent
and
the
jury
returned
the
verdict
of
guilty.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
this
is
the
reason
why
we
tried
to
present
it
in
this
fashion,
because
it
seems
to
us
that
on
those
facts
and
given
the
instructions
which
the
court
gave
clearly
instructed
on
burden
of
proof,
clearly
instructed
on
presumption
of
innocence,
that
it's
just
inconceivable
to
me
that
a
lay
jury
could
have
taken
that
instruction
about
witnesses
being
presumed
to
speak
the
truth
and
could
have
turned
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
into
an
instruction
which
did
just
the
opposite,
which
placed
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant,
and
this
is
particularly
true
in
this
case
because
of
what
occurred
at
the
time
that
the
jury
had
received
its
instruction
and
counsel
took
his
exceptions
to
the
instructions.
at
the
time
that
their
prepared
instruction
were
given
the
court
and
defense
counsel,
the
prosecutor
and
the
defendant,
in
court
report,
all
went
in
to
the
court's
chambers
and
they
then
considered
whether
or
not
there
were
exceptions
to
the
instructions
and
the
counsel
did
take
some,
and
one
of
the
instructions
which
he
requested,
which
he
had
an
answer
for
was
an
instruction
on
that
the
jury
was
not
to
infer
guilt
from
the
fact
that
the
defendant
didn't
take
the
stand.
this
is
what
this
instruction
--
of
course,
there
is
considerable
disagreement
among
defense
counsel
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
grid
instruction
or
not,
some
counsel
preferred
--
some
consider
that
the
instruction
is
in
the
words
of
the
ninth
circuit
"don't
put
the
jelly
bean
in
your
nose"
instruction,
because
it
simply
caused
attention
to
something
that
the
jury
might
otherwise
have
overlooked.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
yes.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
well
we
think
that
it
comes
before
the
court
in
two
ways
and
maybe
these
are
subtle
statements
of
the
same
principle.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
yes.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
yes,
we
have
raised
both
of
those
issues.
the
first
way
of
stating
it
is
this,
that
the
instruction
itself,
while
it
does
present
a
colorable
constitutional
issue,
because
it's
been
discussed
in
the
various
circuits,
in
a
constitutional
context,
and
the
courts
have
generally
not
given
good
marks
to
this
instruction,
that
our
position
is,
it's
just
not
that
bad,
that
it
should
result
in
the
reversal
in
federal
habeas
corpus
of
a
jury
verdict
on
these
facts.
that
it's
just
inconceivable
that
on
the
facts
of
the
case
and
given
the
clear
precise
instructions
that
the
court
gave
that
a
jury
could
possibly
have
even
understood
what
the
legal
issue
was
all
about.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
yes.
now,
they
also
found
that
none
of
other
instructions
which
the
trial
judge
had
given
specifically
obviated
the
problem
that
is
involved
in
this
instruction.
well,
we
think
that
it
did
because
the
jury
was
called
back
or
rather
the
court
and
parties
went
back
into
the
courtroom
and
after
the
jury
has
been
sitting
there
and
they
are
called
back
into
the
courtroom
and
court
again
gave
them
some
instruction
which
says
that
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
defendant
and
that
--
mr.
john
w.
osburn
pardon
me,
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
the
state,
that
the
state
must
prove
its
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
the
defendant
is
presumed
to
be
innocent.
now
we
certainly
recognized
that
it's
fundamental
to
our
law
that
a
guilt
of
the
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it's
not
quite
so
clear
that
an
instruction
must
be
given
to
a
state
tourt
trial
jury
that
the
defendant
is
presumed
to
be
innocent.
nevertheless
that
is
an
instruction
which
is
always
given
under
our
state
law
and
which
was
given
in
this
case.
now,
then
the
question
is
what
is
there
about
the
presumption
instruction
that
suddenly
shifts
the
burden
to
the
defendant,
even
though
the
court
said
time
and
again
that
the
defendant
had
no
burden.
well,
the
argument
goes
that
where
the
defendant
does
not
testify
and
where
the
defendant
does
not
present
any
evidence
or
call
any
witnesses,
that
the
instruction
really
amounts
to
a
presumption
of
that
witnesses
who
are
called
by
the
state
have
told
the
truth.
because
the
instruction
is
expressed
in
terms
of
a
rebuttable
presumption,
every
witness
is
presumed
to
speak
the
truth,
says
the
instruction.
this
presumption
may
be
overcome
by
the
manner
in
which
the
witness
testifies,
by
the
nature
of
his
or
her
testimony,
by
evidence
affecting
his
or
her
character,
interest
or
motives,
by
contradictory
evidence
or
by
a
presumption.
now,
the
instruction
says
in
its
very
words
that
while
the
witness
is
presumed
to
speak
the
truth,
that
the
witness
himself
may
overcome
that
presumption.
the
presumption
may
be
overcome
by
the
manner
in
which
the
witness
testifies,
by
the
nature
of
his
testimony.
the
jury
was
again
told
at
later
place
in
the
instructions
that
you
are
not
bound
to
find
in
conformity
with
the
testimony
of
the
declarations
of
any
number
of
witnesses
which
do
not
produce
belief
in
your
minds.
now
we
have
tried
as
is
our
lawyerly
duty
in
the
brief
to
explain
why
the
instruction
is
given,
to
explain
what
it
is
intended
to
convey,
and
i
think
essentially
it
simply
intended
to
convey
the
impression
to
the
jury
that
the
jury
is
there
to
hear
the
testimony,
they
are
there
to
hear
to
witnesses.
they
may
begin
with
a
presumption
that
a
person
who
is
sworn
on
oath,
is
not
going
to
commit
perjury
and
until
there
is
something
that
occurs,
something
about
the
way
the
witness
testifies,
something
about
the
way
he
looks
or
the
nature
of
what
he
says
that
convinces
a
person
that
he
is
not
telling
the
truth.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
yes.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
this
instruction
was
given
for
many
years.
it
has
been
part
of
the
standard
form
instructions.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
yes.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
i
have
had
an
occasion
to
speak
to
judicial
conferences,
of
course,
and
i
have
been
discouraged
to
give
any
of
the
instruction.
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
says
it's
not,
or
if
you
give
it,
but
that
doesn’t
mean
it
that
it
has
to
be
given
and
so
we
have
discouraged
its
use.
but,
it
has
generally
been
given.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
yes.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
well,
this
is
an
instruction
that
has
been
given
for
about
a
hundred
years
and
it
is
only
in
the
last
few
years,
in
fact
this
is
the
first
known
case
in
which
anybody
has
challenged
the
instruction.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
i
don’t
see
any
difference
in
this
instruction.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
i
don’t
see
any
difference.
the
manner
of
evaluating
when
a
person
gets
on
the
stand,
the
manner
of
how
you
start
out
looking
at
it,
whether
or
not
you
say
to
yourself,
alright,
this
is
a
person
who
is
called
who
presumably
knows
something
about
the
case,
and
presumably
is
going
to
tell
the
truth.
that
applies
across
the
board
to
all
witnesses.
now,
we
do
mention
in
the
brief,
of
course,
that
witnesses
to
a
case
are
chosen
not
by
the
parties.
these
aren’t
the
prosecution’s
witnesses;
these
are
the
people
who
were
there.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
they
are
the
prosecution’s
witnesses
only
in
the
sense
that
the
prosecution
has
chosen
to
call
them.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
well
we
have
a
rule
of
course
as
a
matter
of
state
practice
that
you
can’t
impeach
your
own
witness
by
evidence
of
bad
character
or
something
else.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
exactly.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
right.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
yes.
i
thought
that
was
referred
to
in
the
respondent’s
--
mr.
john
w.
osburn
well,
of
course,
mathes's
instructions
are
federal
instructions
and
our
state
courts
as
the
most
state
court
have
their
own
uniform
jury
instructions.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
well
it's
unusual
and
that
i
think
as
we
indicated
judge
mathes
was
a
california
trial
judge
and
when
he
had
the
opportunity
to
prepare
the
uniform
jury
instructions,
he
put
that
in,
apparently
because
of
his
california
background,
and
it
immediately
met
with
disfavor
by
practically
every
circuit.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
there
are
cases
--
many
of
the
cases
which,
of
course,
are
federal
prosecutions,
do
speak
in
terms
of
constitutional
infirmity,
but
they
are
talking
in
a
context
in
which
they
don’t
have
to
put
it
on
constitutional
grounds,
because
the
court
of
appeals,
of
course,
are
free
to
suggest
that
the
instruction
is
a
poor
one,
which
it
well
may
be.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
yes.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
yes.
and
as
we
indicate
there
is
only
one
case
of
the
--
nearly
the
cases
that
have
disapproved
the
instruction
in
which,
like
this
case,
that's
the
only
issue
that's
raised.
normally
there
has
been
some
other
problem,
a
problem
of
failure
to
give
an
accomplished
instruction
or
something
like
this,
but
our
concern
here
is
and
if
the
reason
for
requesting
this
court
to
review
the
case
is
that
of
course
there
is
a
constitutional
colorable
question
presented
here,
of
course
we
recognize
that.
our
concern
is
though
that
there
must
be
some
point
at
which
we
say
that
although
a
colorable
constitutional
issue
is
presented
that
the
constitutional
--
the
problem
is
really
not
one
of
constitutional
magnitude,
such
as
to
justify
overturning
the
decision
of
the
jury
and
requiring
the
defendant
to
be
tried
anew.
i
think
basically
that
states
our
position.
mr.
john
w.
osburn
just
briefly
your
honor.
we
assume
i
think
as
lawyers
that
the
words
that
we
say
in
a
courtroom
are
hung
on
by
the
jury
and
that
they
attach
great
significance
to
them,
and
we
have
talked
now
both
in
briefs
and
in
oral
argument
about
this
instruction.
remember
this
is
an
instruction
that
went
to
the
jury
in
about
15
seconds
and
they
heard
that
middle
of
all
kinds
of
other
instructions
about
other
things.
we
ask
a
great
deal
of
jurors.
we
bring
people
in
who
are
cab
drivers
and
housewives.
we
sit
them
down
in
a
courtroom
and
we
parade
witnesses
in
front
of
them
and
then
ask
people
to
make
a
decision.
we
think
the
fact
finding
system
here
was
fair
that
the
adequate
evidence
was
presented,
and
that
there
was
nothing
essentially
wrong
with
the
standard
which
was
employed
by
the
court,
that
instruction
is
not
a
model
but
it's
just
not
that
bad.
