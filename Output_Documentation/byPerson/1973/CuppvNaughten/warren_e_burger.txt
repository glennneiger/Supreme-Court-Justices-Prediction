cupp
against

mr.
osburn
i
think
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready
now.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
mr.
solicitor
general
that
you
have
reviewed
these
evidentiary
matters
in
detail,
perhaps
the
purposes
of
indicating
that
the
guilt
was
established
by
overwhelming
evidences
of
it,
there
is
no
question
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
instruction
is
that
at
least
one
circuit
reversed
on
the
pure
supervisory
powers,
i
don’t
know
about
the
others.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
mr.
runkel.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
where
did
you
find
the
burden
of
proof
standards
in
the
constitution?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it's
rooted
we
now
say,
in
the
due
process
clause,
but
it's
not
explicit
anywhere
in
the
constitution.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
suppose
counsel
that
this
instruction
had
been
given
before
any
evidence
went
in
as
some
trial
judges
in
some
courts
do;
give
some
general
instructions
of
the
jurors,
particularly
jurors
at
the
outset
of
their
service
will
grasp
the
burden
of
proof
concept
before
they
hear
the
evidence.
now,
suppose
these
instructions
had
been
given
in
advance,
would
you
think
that
would
lighten
the
problem
any?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
tell
the
jury
that
they
were
the
sole
judges
and
facts
the
usual
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that
can
somewhat
nuetralise
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
why
not
the
instruction
that
justice
marshall
just
proposed,
would
you
think
that
was
unconstitutional,
if
the
judge
reminded
them
that
the
witnesses
had
taken
an
oath
and
if
they
have
not
told
the
truth
they
would
be
subjected
to
prosecution
for
perjury?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
taking
a
shortcut,
read
that
into
the
instruction.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
that's
less
objectionable,
less
impact
on
the
defendant
than
what
was
said
here?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
there
is
general
agreement
on
that
in
the
profession,
don't
you
think?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
evidence
a
little
bit
more
than
sufficient
we
would
say
--
you
are
not
suggesting
that
it
is
just
to
enough
to
get
the
jury
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
that's
a
different
point.
your
position
then
would
be
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
the
weight
of
the
evidence
is
irrelevant
on
this
point.
chief
justice
warren
e.

you
