mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
addressing
the
constitutional
issues
that
mr.
larson
has
discussed,
i
would
like
to
raise
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance,
which
i
think
will
permit
this
court
to
decide
the
case
without
reaching
the
constitutional
issues.
the
appellants
stand
before
this
court
in
this
posture,
they
are
attacking
the
constitutional
adequacy
of
procedures
that
they
have
never
invoked.
under
familiar
principles
requiring
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
their
claim
should
not
be
entertained.
to
understand
why
we
take
this
position,
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
clear
understanding
of
what
the
procedures
are,
that
are
provided
by
the
regulations
and
those
governing
regulations
are
set
out
of
pages
33
to
38
of
our
brief.
the
stage
is
set
for
these
procedures,
of
course,
when
an
applicant
or
unemployment
compensation
submits
an
application
to
a
state
unemployment
compensation
board.
the
state
unemployment
compensation
board
thereupon
seeks
information
from
the
federal
employing
agency,
with
respect
to
the
employee
service,
including
most
particularly
for
this
case,
the
reasons
for
his
termination.
now,
if
a
discharged
probationary
employee,
which
is
what
we
have
in
this
case,
is
denied
unemployment
compensation,
because
of
the
stated
of
reason
for
his
discharge,
he
has
the
following
procedures
available
to
him.
first,
under
section
609.22
of
the
regulations,
which
appears
at
page
36.
he
may
obtain
from
the
employing
agency
any
information
he
needs
relating
to
the
basis
for
the
federal
finding,
the
federal
finding
being
the
reason
stated
for
his
discharge.
under
section
609.8,
which
is
two
pages
earlier
on
page
34,
the
employing
agency
must
furnish
this
information
in
writing
and
i
add
right
here
that
for
appellant
green,
if
he
wished
to
know
who
it
was
who
observed
him
drinking
at
the
time
he
was
observed
drinking,
he
was
free
to
ask
the
question
and
get
a
response
in
writing.
second,
under
609.23
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
36,
top
of
page
37,
the
employee
may
file
a
written
request
for
reconsideration
and
correction
of
the
findings
that
have
been
submitted
to
the
state
agency
and
he
may
submit
together
without
request
any
information
he
has
to
support
his
request.
again,
referring
back
to
page,
the
preceding
page
at
609.9,
the
agency
must
consider
all
the
information
submitted.
it
must
review
its
findings.
it
must
correct
any
errors,
and
at
most
in
affirm,
modify,
or
reverse
whatever
the
findings
are
affected.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
pardon
me?
i’m
referring
to
the
government’s
brief
in
this
case,
the
appendix
short
brief.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
this
is
all
a
paper
proceeding.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
i
think
that
is
right.
well,
this
is
not
--
yes,
that’s
a
fair
statement.
if
there
is
a
correction
that
is
made
by
the
state,
be
the
federal
employee
agency.
the
agency
had
required
to
submit
this
to
the
state
and
the
state
if
the
corrections
looked
like
the
entitled
the
employee
to
a
re-determination,
the
state
is
required
by
the
regulation
to
make
that
re-determination.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it
just
sends
the
same
slip.
it's
in
first
placing
we've
considered
and
affirmed
or
sustain
or
modify
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
now,
i
emphasize
that
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
absolutely
right,
we
don’t
claim
that
the
full
due
process
hearing’s
are,
not
that
we
claim
there
is
no
due
process
so,
right
it
is
implicated,
but
i’ll
turn
to
that
in
a
moment,
but
right
now
i’m
just
trying
to
point
the
existing
procedures,
whether
valid
or
invalid
under
the
constitution
were
never
invoked
(voice
overlap)
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
that’s
my
point.
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
argument
was
not,
so
far
as
i
can
tell,
made
to
the
district
court.
it
was
made
in
our
briefs
in
this
court,
at
pages
8
and
23,
and
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
we
are
parties,
but
we
--
the
federal
defendants
in
that
case
were
dismissed
on
subject
matter
jurisdiction
grounds,
and
i
might
add
in
response
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question,
mr.
larson’s
right,
we
do
not
contest
jurisdiction
on
the
mandamus
statute.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
i
concede
that
i
can't
stipulate
to
jurisdiction.
these
are
in
any
event
the
procedures,
the
corrective
procedures
that
are
available
and
were
involved.
and,
it’s
important
to
consider
how
they
might
have
operated
in
these
cases
if
they
had
been
invoked.
appellant
christian
was
terminated
after
six
months
of
employment
as
a
letter
carrier,
because
of
a
history
of
unauthorized
absences,
which
climaxed
in
two
instances,
in
which
she
was
two
days,
in
which
she
was
absent
without
notifying
her
supervisor.
this
is
after
she
had
been
warned
and
had
been
placed
on
a
restricted
sick
list,
which
required
her
to
bring
in
an
authorized
medical
excuse
for
any
further
absences.
and,
upon
the
receipt
by
the
state
board
of
this
information,
the
determination
was
made
that
she
would
not
be
eligible
for
unemployment
compensation,
because
the
fact
amounted
to
a
voluntary
quitting
without
good
cause
that
is
under
state
law
these
facts
are
led
to
the
conclusion
that
she
provoked
her
discharged
by
the
final
two
absences.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
my
point,
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
was
never
made
to
the
district
court,
as
far
as
i
can
determine,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
it
is
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance
and
i
think
we’re
entitled
to
present
here
and
i
think
that
this
court
is
entitled
to
consider
the
argument
in
disposing
of
the
case.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it’s
a
possibility,
i
don’t
think
it
requires
any
factual
inquiry
that
would
be
more
appropriate
for
district
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
kind
of
question
that
can
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
what’s
before
this
court
and
there’s
no
real
benefit
to
be
gained
by
remanding
it
for
the
purpose.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
problematic
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap)
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
presents
a
problem,
the
regulations
provide
that
the
employing
agency
shall
make
any
corrections
that
if
fines
must
be
made
within
one
year,
now
obviously
the
year
is
past
as
a
consequence
of
a
litigation,
it
maybe
impossible.
i
would
think
that
their
deregulations
might
limply
be
construed
in
these
cases
to
permit
to
exhaust
these
procedures
if
they
sought
to
do
so,
on
remand
or
on
their
own.
after
the
denial
of
the
claim
of
christian’s
claim,
she
was
given
a
copy
of
findings
and
then,
as
she
states
in
her
affidavit,
which
appears
in
the
appendix
of
pages
15
and
18.
she
sets
out
her
disagreement
with
the
underlying
facts
that
were
transmitted
to
the
state
agency.
she
claimed
that
she
failed
to
report
her
absences
in
the
original,
in
the
older
absences,
because
she
couldn’t
find
a
telephone
that
was
in
working
order
in
her
neighborhood
to
call
in.
and,
she
said
that
the
last
two
absences
were
required
by
compelling
family
circumstance,
and
then
in
fact
she
had
asked
her
older
daughter
to
make
a
telephone
call
to
her
supervisor.
and,
in
fact
her
daughter
said
that
she
had
done
so.
well,
these
are
precisely
the
kinds
of
new
facts,
new
information
that
the
regulations
contemplate
being
submitted
to
the
agency
for
their
consideration,
that
was
never
done
here,
so
the
agency
never
had
the
chance
to
consider
these
new
facts.
if
in
fact,
the
facts
whereas
stated
by
appellant
christian,
she
might
as
well
submitted
(voice
overlap)
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
record,
i
suppose
is
blank
on
the
point,
but
i
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
wasn’t
done.
i
believe
the
record
is
clear
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
it
wasn’t
done.
i
don’t
know
where
i
can
point
to
it,
but
there's
never
been
any
suggestion
by
anyone
that
it
has
been
done.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it’s
clear
--
well,
i
can't
put
my
finger
on
it.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
mr.
larson
will
concede
that
this
was
not
done.
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
factual
issue
here.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
could
say
it,
but
i
don’t
think
i
can
point
it
to
you
-–
point
it
out
to
you
in
the
record,
but
the
reason
i
can't
point
out
to
you
in
the
record
is
that
the
issue
wasn’t
presented.
the
only
thing
there
is
in
the
record
that’s
of
relevance
here
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
complaint
and
the
agreed
upon
material
and
statement
of
material
facts,
as
to
which
there
was
no
dispute.
i
make
it
clear
that
appellants
have
not
sought
any
relief
from
the
employing
agency,
although
they
recognize
that
the
procedures
exist.
they
make
no
mention
of
any
fact
of
having
exhausted
those
procedures.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
there’s
nothing
in
there
that
says
they
did.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
they
did
not.
although
again,
in
their
complaint
they
took
cognizance
of
the
existence
of
these
procedures,
there
was
no
allegation
that
they
were
invoked.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
as
i
said,
i
think
the
regulations
might
be
construed
to
permit
them
to
exhaust
their
remedies
even
now,
even
though
they
--
i
mean
the
time
has
elapsed
because
of
litigation,
but
i
think
that
they
would
be
permitted
an
opportunity
to
undergo
those
procedures.
the
same
situation
is
present
in
the
case
of
appellant
green,
who
was
discharged
for
drinking
before
flight
duty.
he
claims
and
his
unemployment
compensation
was
denied
on
the
ground
of
that
he
was
discharged
from
misconduct
under
state
law.
and,
he
claims
again,
he’s
innocent
of
these
charges,
but
he
never
bothered
to
give
his
employer
the
benefit
of
any
exculpatory
information
he
may
have
nor
he
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
he
had
to
get
the
information,
he
claims
he
didn’t
have
to
make
the
judgment
with.
in
these
circumstances,
in
our
view,
the
appellants
should
not
be
heard
to
complain
of
corrective
procedures,
if
they
haven’t
invoked.
the
exhaustion
principle
has
traditionally
been
required,
because
of
what
this
court
in
mckart
v.
united
states
called
the
practical
notions
of
judicial
efficiency.
if
christian
and
green
had
invoked
the
procedures
it
may
be
that
their
employing
agencies
would
have
agreed
that
they
had
a
mistake
and
would
have
corrected
the
findings.
if
that
were
the
result,
this
court
or
no
court
would
have
had
to
intervene.
there
would
have
been
no
judicial
issue.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
don’t
have
any
citations,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
believe
it
ought
to
be
the
burden
of
the
plaintiffs
to
make
the
allegation.
but,
i
say
again,
while
the
issue
maybe
somewhat
ambiguous
in
the
state
of
the
record
here,
i
don’t
think
there's
any
legitimate
factual
dispute
over
it.
i
think
mr.
larson
will
concede
that
there's
no
question
if
they
didn’t
exhaust
these
procedures.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
see
if
the
problem
is
that
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
they
did
exhaust
it,
and
you
know
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
they
didn’t
either,
but
i
guess
the
question
comes
down
to
where
the
burden
lies,
and
i
think
i’ve
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it
maybe
that
the
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
wasn’t
there
below
and
i
don’t
know
what
went
into
their
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
i’m
certainly
am.
i
think
that
the
thrust
of
the
government’s
response
to
the
suit
in
the
court
of
below
was
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
they
responded
on
the
merits
to
the
constitutional
claims
and
they
succeeded
on
the
jurisdictional
issues
and
the
constitutional
claims
of
course
were
not
addressed
with
respect
to
the
federal
defendants
in
this
case.
there's
a
corollary
notion
to
that
of
judicial
efficiency
that
impels,
that
suggest
that
this
court
opt
not
to
entertain
the
issue
at
this
time,
and
that
is
the
notion
of
administrative
autonomy,
which
requires
that
an
agency
to
give
them
a
chance
to
correct
its
own
errors.
here,
no
such
chance
was
given.
the
only
response
that
the
appellants
have
made
to
this
argument
incidentally,
is
contained
in
a
footnote
and
their
reply
brief,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
might
be
where
they
indicated
that
they
didn’t
exhaust
the
procedures.
well,
they
say
in
the
footnote
these
problems,
“the
appellees
also
contend
that
appellants
cannot
complain
about
the
constitutional
inadequacy
of
the
federal
appellees
ex
parte
procedure."
this
is
i’m
reading
by
the
way
from
page
8
of
their
reply
brief,
since
they
did
not
utilize
the
ex
parte
corrective
procedures.
such
an
allegation
is
wholly
without
merit,
where
as
here,
the
adequacy
of
the
administrative
procedure
is
the
very
issue
to
be
resolved.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
have
them
on
page
8,
footnote
6,
but
i
don’t
have
the
printed
brief
that
may
explain
the
differences,
i’m
sorry.
so
to
the
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
inference
is
available
on
any
event
that
they
have
not
in
fact,
exhausted
the
procedures.
i
don’t
want
to
press
it
anymore,
because
as
you
say
there's
nothing
definitive
that
i
can
point
to
in
the
record.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
it’s
probably
an
over
statement
mr.
justice.
there
is
of
course,
an
analytical
distinction
between
a
hearing,
with
respect
to
the
reasons
for
discharge,
as
it
relates
to
unemployment
compensation
and
a
hearing
with
respect
the
validity
of
a
discharged
looking
towards
reinstatement.
and,
there's
no
question
that
they’re
separate,
but
the
thrust
of
the
statement,
while
it
may
have
been
an
over
statement,
i
think
is
accurate.
one
of
the
reasons
why
a
hearing
would
be
inadvisable.
and,
one
of
the
reasons
why
a
hearing
is
not
provided,
i
think
is
that
with
respect
to
probationary
employees,
there
needs
to
be
the
greatest
amount
of
flexibility
in
an
effort
to
weed
out
before
an
employee
gets
tenured
status,
incompetent
and
unsuitable
employees,
because
of
the
importance
of
having
abled
people
administering
the
government’s
vital
programs.
once
a
man
becomes
tenured,
it’s
very
difficult
to
remove
them.
and,
there
are--the
whole
panoply
procedures
and
just
because
of
that
extra
protection
he
gets,
it’s
necessary
that
there
be
a
great
flexibility
at
the
early
stage.
now,
a
hearing
on
the
reasons
for
discharge
of
a
probationary
employee
is
going
to
have
an
impact
on
the
decisions
of
supervisor’s
make
necessarily.
it’s
not
because
the
issue
is
one
of
reinstatement,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
a
hearing,
the
prospect
of
a
hearing
is
likely
to
be
at
deterrent
to
a
supervisor,
just
because
he
realized
that
there's
a
great
deal
of
manpower
that
has
to
go
into
it,
a
great
deal
of
preparation.
his
decision
in
a
sense
is
going
to
be
put
on
the
line,
even
though
there's
not
going
to
be
an
reinstatement
that’ll
result
from
it.
there
is
going
to
be
a
psychological
impact
and
it
will,
i
think,
inhibit
the
flexibility,
that
i
think
is
so
essential.
so,
in
answer
to
your
question,
there
is
a
relationship,
though
is
not
an
analytically
clear
one.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i’d
like
to
turn
briefly
to
the
statutory
interpretation
question.
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
should
note
to
your
benefit
i
think,
that
the
issue
turns
not
on
the
section
that
you
had
read,
it
turns
on
section
8506
of
title
5,
which
set
forth
at
our
brief,
at
pages
31
and
32.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right,
that’s
the
one
that
requires
the
federal
employing
agency
to
respond
to
a
request
from
a
state
agency,
by
giving
the
findings,
as
what
the
word
is.
now,
that
the
issue
really
turns
on
whether
findings
implies
a
hearing.
it
seems
to
me
plain
that
the
findings
doesn’t
have
that
implication.
what
it
means
here
is
simply
a
determination
after
an
inquiry.
it
has
no
implication
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
the
form
that
inquiry
would
take.
and,
you
know
when
congress
has
had
a
desire
to
require
a
hearing,
it
is
not
difficult
to
do
so
ambiguously
and
i
should
mention
in
the
very
next
section,
in
8507,
which
is
not
reprinted
in
the
briefs,
8507
deals
with
the
right
of
a
state
agency
or
the
secretary
of
labor
to
recoup
compensation
paid
to
an
employee
who
made
a
false
statement,
if
he
first
finds
that
there
has
been
a
false
statement
made.
now,
what
that
says
is
“a
finding
by
a
state
agency
or
the
secretary
maybe
made
only
after
an
opportunity
for
a
fair
hearing.”
in
the
very
next
section,
using
the
exact
same
words,
they
found
it
necessary
to
add
only
after
a
hearing.
i
think
that
makes
it
quite
clear
that
congress
did
not
contemplate
it,
that
there
necessarily
be
a
hearing
preceding
the
findings
that
are
referred
to
8506.
mr.
larson
is
correct
in
saying
that
we
do
not
say
this
is
the
only
possible
interpretation
of
the
statute.
i
think
a
lot
of
the
policy
of
unemployment
statutes
that
the
appellants
set
forth
in
their
brief
may
well
give
this
court
the
option
if
it
came
to
that
of
reading
the
statute
to
require
a
hearing,
if
it
was
necessary
to
preserve
its
constitutionality.
the
point
is
however,
that
this
a
reading
of
the
statute
by
the
agency
principally
responsible
for
administering
it,
that
we
think
it’s
permissible
and
that
we
think
ought
to
be
respective,
unless
there’s
a
constitutional
problem.
there
are
really
two
constitutional
issues
here,
one
is
a
due
process
issue
and
one
is
an
equal
protection
issue
and
our
position
is
that
in
neither
argument
is
valid.
to
start
with
a
due
process
issue,
we
believe
that
the
due
process
clause
is
not
even
implicated.
it
provides
that
there
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
life,
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
there’s
no
question
that
the
appellants
have
not
been
deprived
of
life.
they
don’t
assert
that
they’ve
been
deprived
of
liberty,
and
so
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
property
right
at
stake.
our
position
is
that
the
property
right
in
unemployment
compensation
benefits,
like
the
right
to
continued
employment
in
the
roth
case
is
defined
by
the
rules
and
understandings,
under
which
the
benefit
is
granted.
in
roth,
the
rules
and
understandings
where
contained
in
the
terms
of
the
appointment.
in
this
case,
the
rules
and
understanding
are
contained
within
the
terms
of
the
statutes
in
governing
regulations.
and,
those
statutes
and
governing
regulations
made
clear
that
the
procedures
available
for
correcting
errors
is
the
only
procedure
and
that
is
the
only
way,
one
can
correct
errors
that
they
find
are
made.
so,
when
one
seeks
unemployment
compensation
benefits,
one
seeks
them
with
the
understanding,
that
if
there
are
errors
in
the
federal
findings,
they
can
be
corrected
by
one
method
and
one
method
only.
in
these
circumstance,
there
is
no
property
right,
unless
the
procedures
that
are
specified
have
some
sense
been
denied
to
the
person.
i
can
think
of
one
example
that
might
serve
to
make
the
point,
suppose
at
congress
enacted
a
statute
granting
benefits
to
victims
of
crime,
provided
that
the
administrator
should
first
find
on
the
basis
of
an
application
that
has
been
submitted
and
on
the
basis
of
certified
hospital
and
police
records
that
in
fact,
the
person
was
injured
in
the
course
of
a
violent
crime.
and,
supposed
further,
that
the
administrator’s
determination
were
made
unreviewable,
except
that
the
applicant
after
a
denial
of
his
application,
might
inquire
further
of
the
administrator,
as
to
the
further--as
the
basis
of
the
denial
and
might
seek
reconsideration.
now,
this
is
basically
what
we
have
here,
and
i
think
it’s
clear
that
there
would
be
no
due
process
right,
no
legitimate
entitlement
that
an
applicant
who
had
been
injured,
who
claimed
to
be
have
been
injured
in
a
course
of
a
violent
crime,
would
have
to
a
due
process
hearing
before
the
denial.
this
is
because
the
right,
as
congress
has
to
find
it,
includes
only
the
procedures
of
congress
has
specified.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
justice
stewart
that
language
comes
from,
i
believe,
title
42,
which
is
the
social
security
act,
which
of
course
does
set
up
the
standards,
by
which
the
secretary
will
approve
state
unemployment
compensation
plans,
but
that
is
quite
different
than
the
statutory
scheme
that
was
created
from
unemployment
compensation
for
federal
employees.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right,
except
that
the
statute
quite
clearly
said
that
the
information
that
is
submitted
to
the
state
agency
by
the
federal
employing
agency
shall
be
binding
and
conclusive.
there
is
no
ambiguity
about
that,
there
maybe
some
ambiguity
about
whether
the
federal
government
needs
first
to
give
them
hearing,
before
they
transmit
the
findings
or
after
they’ve
transmitted
their
findings.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
it’s
--
the
statutory
scheme
that’s
been
set
up
for
the
federal
employees
makes
special
provision
for
this.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
says
the
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
findings
made
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i’m
sorry
on
page
32
of
our
brief,
which
is
section
8506,
towards
the
middle
of
the
page.
findings
made
in
accordance
with
the
regulations
are
final
and
conclusive
for
the
purpose
of
section
850
--
now,
there
is
no
question
that
the
findings
here
were
made
in
accordance
with
the
regulations.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
there
is
a
statutory
question,
i’ve
dealt
with
that.
but,
assuming
that
the
secretary’s
reading
is
correct,
and
that
or
permissible,
i
should
say.
and,
that
the
findings
needn’t
be
predicated
upon
a
hearing.
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
congress
has
made
it
clear
that
they’ve
defined
the
right
to
make
with
the
condition
that
these
findings
will
be
conclusive
enough,
be
open
for
further
litigation.
i’d
like
to
touch
very
briefly
on
the
equal
protection
arguments.
there
has
been
suggestion
that
there
is
a
constitutional
impermissible
discrimination
between
state
employees
and
private
employees
who
are
given
full
benefits.
and,
between
probationary
federal
employees
who
were
not
given
full
benefits.
but
again,
these
statutes
had
been
setup
different
times,
for
different
purposes
and
it
seems
to
me
our
perfectly
proper
for
congress
to
draw,
to
strike
a
different
balance
in
the
context
of
federally
funded
benefits,
when
you’re
dealing
with
federal
employing
agency.
the
congress
might
reasonably
determine
that
it
was
too
much
of
a
burden
on
the
federal
government
to
require
it
to
respond
with
hearings,
in
every
case.
and,
especially
where
they
are
giving
us
an
alternative.
and,
at
least
on
its
face,
so
far
as
we
can
tell
from
this
case,
an
adequate
way
of
correcting
the
errors
might
have
been
made.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
it
is,
shortly
after
the
smith
case
was
decided
the
secretary
of
labor
amended
his
regulations
to
provide
that
an
employee
who
has
resigned,
a
probationary
employee,
who
has
resigned
and
who
disputes
the
findings
of
the
federal
employing
agency
may
have
a
hearing.
now,
there
is
a
reason
for
that
too.
in
the
case
of
a
discharged
employee,
there
is
no
question
as
to
what
the
reasons
were,
i
mean
it’s
within
the
federal
government’s
competence
to
know
what
it
was
in
it’s
own
mind
when
it
discharged
an
employee.
when
an
employee
resigns
however,
for
example,
if
he
resigns
saying
that
he
resigned,
because
it
was
too
cold
to
work
in
that
building,
and
the
fact
is
from
the
federal
standpoint
that
he
was
resigned
three
days
after
he
was
told
he
was
going
to
be
terminated
or
might
be
terminated.
there's
no
way
to
resolve
definitively
what
was
in
the
employee’s
mind.
and,
if
he
wishes
to
commit
in
that
point
and
show
that
what
is
in
his
mind
is
that
the
room
was
cold,
that’s
available
to
him,
under
the
regulations.
there’s
one
other,
of
course,
one
other
distinction
that
is
between
the
treatment
of
probationary
employees
and
permanent
employees.
and,
i
think
that
the
difference
is
they’re
relate
not
to
the
statute,
which
gives
them
no
permanent
employees,
no
greater
rights
to
hearing,
to
prevent
to
the
findings
are
final
and
conclusive.
but,
it
relates
to
their
different
civil
service
status,
they
have
a
right
to
hearing
with
respect
to
their
continued
tenure
and
if
it
turns
out
after
that
hearing
that
the
findings
needed
to
be
corrected,
well
the
regulations
specified
that
the
agency
must
correct
findings
if
it
determines
that
there
was
an
error
within
a
year.
but,
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
is
not
to
challenge
the
findings
for
unemployment
compensation,
but
solely
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
discharge.
so
again,
if
there's
a
distinction
between
them
and
in
light
of
all
these,
we
submit
that
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
before
addressing
the
constitutional
issues
that
mr.
larson
has
discussed,
i
would
like
to
raise
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance,
which
i
think
will
permit
this
court
to
decide
the
case
without
reaching
the
constitutional
issues.
the
appellants
stand
before
this
court
in
this
posture,
they
are
attacking
the
constitutional
adequacy
of
procedures
that
they
have
never
invoked.
under
familiar
principles
requiring
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies,
their
claim
should
not
be
entertained.
to
understand
why
we
take
this
position,
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
clear
understanding
of
what
the
procedures
are,
that
are
provided
by
the
regulations
and
those
governing
regulations
are
set
out
of
pages
33
to
38
of
our
brief.
the
stage
is
set
for
these
procedures,
of
course,
when
an
applicant
or
unemployment
compensation
submits
an
application
to
a
state
unemployment
compensation
board.
the
state
unemployment
compensation
board
thereupon
seeks
information
from
the
federal
employing
agency,
with
respect
to
the
employee
service,
including
most
particularly
for
this
case,
the
reasons
for
his
termination.
now,
if
a
discharged
probationary
employee,
which
is
what
we
have
in
this
case,
is
denied
unemployment
compensation,
because
of
the
stated
of
reason
for
his
discharge,
he
has
the
following
procedures
available
to
him.
first,
under
section
609.22
of
the
regulations,
which
appears
at
page
36.
he
may
obtain
from
the
employing
agency
any
information
he
needs
relating
to
the
basis
for
the
federal
finding,
the
federal
finding
being
the
reason
stated
for
his
discharge.
under
section
609.8,
which
is
two
pages
earlier
on
page
34,
the
employing
agency
must
furnish
this
information
in
writing
and
i
add
right
here
that
for
appellant
green,
if
he
wished
to
know
who
it
was
who
observed
him
drinking
at
the
time
he
was
observed
drinking,
he
was
free
to
ask
the
question
and
get
a
response
in
writing.
second,
under
609.23
which
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
36,
top
of
page
37,
the
employee
may
file
a
written
request
for
reconsideration
and
correction
of
the
findings
that
have
been
submitted
to
the
state
agency
and
he
may
submit
together
without
request
any
information
he
has
to
support
his
request.
again,
referring
back
to
page,
the
preceding
page
at
609.9,
the
agency
must
consider
all
the
information
submitted.
it
must
review
its
findings.
it
must
correct
any
errors,
and
at
most
in
affirm,
modify,
or
reverse
whatever
the
findings
are
affected.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
pardon
me?
i’m
referring
to
the
government’s
brief
in
this
case,
the
appendix
short
brief.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
this
is
all
a
paper
proceeding.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
i
think
that
is
right.
well,
this
is
not
--
yes,
that’s
a
fair
statement.
if
there
is
a
correction
that
is
made
by
the
state,
be
the
federal
employee
agency.
the
agency
had
required
to
submit
this
to
the
state
and
the
state
if
the
corrections
looked
like
the
entitled
the
employee
to
a
re-determination,
the
state
is
required
by
the
regulation
to
make
that
re-determination.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it
just
sends
the
same
slip.
it's
in
first
placing
we've
considered
and
affirmed
or
sustain
or
modify
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
now,
i
emphasize
that
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
absolutely
right,
we
don’t
claim
that
the
full
due
process
hearing’s
are,
not
that
we
claim
there
is
no
due
process
so,
right
it
is
implicated,
but
i’ll
turn
to
that
in
a
moment,
but
right
now
i’m
just
trying
to
point
the
existing
procedures,
whether
valid
or
invalid
under
the
constitution
were
never
invoked
(voice
overlap)
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
that’s
my
point.
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
argument
was
not,
so
far
as
i
can
tell,
made
to
the
district
court.
it
was
made
in
our
briefs
in
this
court,
at
pages
8
and
23,
and
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
we
are
parties,
but
we
--
the
federal
defendants
in
that
case
were
dismissed
on
subject
matter
jurisdiction
grounds,
and
i
might
add
in
response
to
mr.
justice
blackmun’s
question,
mr.
larson’s
right,
we
do
not
contest
jurisdiction
on
the
mandamus
statute.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
no,
i
concede
that
i
can't
stipulate
to
jurisdiction.
these
are
in
any
event
the
procedures,
the
corrective
procedures
that
are
available
and
were
involved.
and,
it’s
important
to
consider
how
they
might
have
operated
in
these
cases
if
they
had
been
invoked.
appellant
christian
was
terminated
after
six
months
of
employment
as
a
letter
carrier,
because
of
a
history
of
unauthorized
absences,
which
climaxed
in
two
instances,
in
which
she
was
two
days,
in
which
she
was
absent
without
notifying
her
supervisor.
this
is
after
she
had
been
warned
and
had
been
placed
on
a
restricted
sick
list,
which
required
her
to
bring
in
an
authorized
medical
excuse
for
any
further
absences.
and,
upon
the
receipt
by
the
state
board
of
this
information,
the
determination
was
made
that
she
would
not
be
eligible
for
unemployment
compensation,
because
the
fact
amounted
to
a
voluntary
quitting
without
good
cause
that
is
under
state
law
these
facts
are
led
to
the
conclusion
that
she
provoked
her
discharged
by
the
final
two
absences.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
my
point,
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
was
never
made
to
the
district
court,
as
far
as
i
can
determine,
mr.
justice
stewart,
but
it
is
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance
and
i
think
we’re
entitled
to
present
here
and
i
think
that
this
court
is
entitled
to
consider
the
argument
in
disposing
of
the
case.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it’s
a
possibility,
i
don’t
think
it
requires
any
factual
inquiry
that
would
be
more
appropriate
for
district
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
kind
of
question
that
can
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
what’s
before
this
court
and
there’s
no
real
benefit
to
be
gained
by
remanding
it
for
the
purpose.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that
is
problematic
mr.
justice
(voice
overlap)
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
presents
a
problem,
the
regulations
provide
that
the
employing
agency
shall
make
any
corrections
that
if
fines
must
be
made
within
one
year,
now
obviously
the
year
is
past
as
a
consequence
of
a
litigation,
it
maybe
impossible.
i
would
think
that
their
deregulations
might
limply
be
construed
in
these
cases
to
permit
to
exhaust
these
procedures
if
they
sought
to
do
so,
on
remand
or
on
their
own.
after
the
denial
of
the
claim
of
christian’s
claim,
she
was
given
a
copy
of
findings
and
then,
as
she
states
in
her
affidavit,
which
appears
in
the
appendix
of
pages
15
and
18.
she
sets
out
her
disagreement
with
the
underlying
facts
that
were
transmitted
to
the
state
agency.
she
claimed
that
she
failed
to
report
her
absences
in
the
original,
in
the
older
absences,
because
she
couldn’t
find
a
telephone
that
was
in
working
order
in
her
neighborhood
to
call
in.
and,
she
said
that
the
last
two
absences
were
required
by
compelling
family
circumstance,
and
then
in
fact
she
had
asked
her
older
daughter
to
make
a
telephone
call
to
her
supervisor.
and,
in
fact
her
daughter
said
that
she
had
done
so.
well,
these
are
precisely
the
kinds
of
new
facts,
new
information
that
the
regulations
contemplate
being
submitted
to
the
agency
for
their
consideration,
that
was
never
done
here,
so
the
agency
never
had
the
chance
to
consider
these
new
facts.
if
in
fact,
the
facts
whereas
stated
by
appellant
christian,
she
might
as
well
submitted
(voice
overlap)
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
record,
i
suppose
is
blank
on
the
point,
but
i
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
wasn’t
done.
i
believe
the
record
is
clear
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
it
wasn’t
done.
i
don’t
know
where
i
can
point
to
it,
but
there's
never
been
any
suggestion
by
anyone
that
it
has
been
done.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it’s
clear
--
well,
i
can't
put
my
finger
on
it.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
think
mr.
larson
will
concede
that
this
was
not
done.
i
don’t
think
it’s
a
factual
issue
here.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
could
say
it,
but
i
don’t
think
i
can
point
it
to
you
-–
point
it
out
to
you
in
the
record,
but
the
reason
i
can't
point
out
to
you
in
the
record
is
that
the
issue
wasn’t
presented.
the
only
thing
there
is
in
the
record
that’s
of
relevance
here
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
complaint
and
the
agreed
upon
material
and
statement
of
material
facts,
as
to
which
there
was
no
dispute.
i
make
it
clear
that
appellants
have
not
sought
any
relief
from
the
employing
agency,
although
they
recognize
that
the
procedures
exist.
they
make
no
mention
of
any
fact
of
having
exhausted
those
procedures.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
there’s
nothing
in
there
that
says
they
did.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
they
did
not.
although
again,
in
their
complaint
they
took
cognizance
of
the
existence
of
these
procedures,
there
was
no
allegation
that
they
were
invoked.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
as
i
said,
i
think
the
regulations
might
be
construed
to
permit
them
to
exhaust
their
remedies
even
now,
even
though
they
--
i
mean
the
time
has
elapsed
because
of
litigation,
but
i
think
that
they
would
be
permitted
an
opportunity
to
undergo
those
procedures.
the
same
situation
is
present
in
the
case
of
appellant
green,
who
was
discharged
for
drinking
before
flight
duty.
he
claims
and
his
unemployment
compensation
was
denied
on
the
ground
of
that
he
was
discharged
from
misconduct
under
state
law.
and,
he
claims
again,
he’s
innocent
of
these
charges,
but
he
never
bothered
to
give
his
employer
the
benefit
of
any
exculpatory
information
he
may
have
nor
he
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
he
had
to
get
the
information,
he
claims
he
didn’t
have
to
make
the
judgment
with.
in
these
circumstances,
in
our
view,
the
appellants
should
not
be
heard
to
complain
of
corrective
procedures,
if
they
haven’t
invoked.
the
exhaustion
principle
has
traditionally
been
required,
because
of
what
this
court
in
mckart
v.
united
states
called
the
practical
notions
of
judicial
efficiency.
if
christian
and
green
had
invoked
the
procedures
it
may
be
that
their
employing
agencies
would
have
agreed
that
they
had
a
mistake
and
would
have
corrected
the
findings.
if
that
were
the
result,
this
court
or
no
court
would
have
had
to
intervene.
there
would
have
been
no
judicial
issue.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
don’t
have
any
citations,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
believe
it
ought
to
be
the
burden
of
the
plaintiffs
to
make
the
allegation.
but,
i
say
again,
while
the
issue
maybe
somewhat
ambiguous
in
the
state
of
the
record
here,
i
don’t
think
there's
any
legitimate
factual
dispute
over
it.
i
think
mr.
larson
will
concede
that
there's
no
question
if
they
didn’t
exhaust
these
procedures.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
see
if
the
problem
is
that
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that
they
did
exhaust
it,
and
you
know
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
they
didn’t
either,
but
i
guess
the
question
comes
down
to
where
the
burden
lies,
and
i
think
i’ve
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
it
maybe
that
the
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
wasn’t
there
below
and
i
don’t
know
what
went
into
their
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
i’m
certainly
am.
i
think
that
the
thrust
of
the
government’s
response
to
the
suit
in
the
court
of
below
was
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
they
responded
on
the
merits
to
the
constitutional
claims
and
they
succeeded
on
the
jurisdictional
issues
and
the
constitutional
claims
of
course
were
not
addressed
with
respect
to
the
federal
defendants
in
this
case.
there's
a
corollary
notion
to
that
of
judicial
efficiency
that
impels,
that
suggest
that
this
court
opt
not
to
entertain
the
issue
at
this
time,
and
that
is
the
notion
of
administrative
autonomy,
which
requires
that
an
agency
to
give
them
a
chance
to
correct
its
own
errors.
here,
no
such
chance
was
given.
the
only
response
that
the
appellants
have
made
to
this
argument
incidentally,
is
contained
in
a
footnote
and
their
reply
brief,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
might
be
where
they
indicated
that
they
didn’t
exhaust
the
procedures.
well,
they
say
in
the
footnote
these
problems,
“the
appellees
also
contend
that
appellants
cannot
complain
about
the
constitutional
inadequacy
of
the
federal
appellees
ex
parte
procedure."
this
is
i’m
reading
by
the
way
from
page
8
of
their
reply
brief,
since
they
did
not
utilize
the
ex
parte
corrective
procedures.
such
an
allegation
is
wholly
without
merit,
where
as
here,
the
adequacy
of
the
administrative
procedure
is
the
very
issue
to
be
resolved.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i
have
them
on
page
8,
footnote
6,
but
i
don’t
have
the
printed
brief
that
may
explain
the
differences,
i’m
sorry.
so
to
the
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
the
inference
is
available
on
any
event
that
they
have
not
in
fact,
exhausted
the
procedures.
i
don’t
want
to
press
it
anymore,
because
as
you
say
there's
nothing
definitive
that
i
can
point
to
in
the
record.
yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
i
think
it’s
probably
an
over
statement
mr.
justice.
there
is
of
course,
an
analytical
distinction
between
a
hearing,
with
respect
to
the
reasons
for
discharge,
as
it
relates
to
unemployment
compensation
and
a
hearing
with
respect
the
validity
of
a
discharged
looking
towards
reinstatement.
and,
there's
no
question
that
they’re
separate,
but
the
thrust
of
the
statement,
while
it
may
have
been
an
over
statement,
i
think
is
accurate.
one
of
the
reasons
why
a
hearing
would
be
inadvisable.
and,
one
of
the
reasons
why
a
hearing
is
not
provided,
i
think
is
that
with
respect
to
probationary
employees,
there
needs
to
be
the
greatest
amount
of
flexibility
in
an
effort
to
weed
out
before
an
employee
gets
tenured
status,
incompetent
and
unsuitable
employees,
because
of
the
importance
of
having
abled
people
administering
the
government’s
vital
programs.
once
a
man
becomes
tenured,
it’s
very
difficult
to
remove
them.
and,
there
are--the
whole
panoply
procedures
and
just
because
of
that
extra
protection
he
gets,
it’s
necessary
that
there
be
a
great
flexibility
at
the
early
stage.
now,
a
hearing
on
the
reasons
for
discharge
of
a
probationary
employee
is
going
to
have
an
impact
on
the
decisions
of
supervisor’s
make
necessarily.
it’s
not
because
the
issue
is
one
of
reinstatement,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
a
hearing,
the
prospect
of
a
hearing
is
likely
to
be
at
deterrent
to
a
supervisor,
just
because
he
realized
that
there's
a
great
deal
of
manpower
that
has
to
go
into
it,
a
great
deal
of
preparation.
his
decision
in
a
sense
is
going
to
be
put
on
the
line,
even
though
there's
not
going
to
be
an
reinstatement
that’ll
result
from
it.
there
is
going
to
be
a
psychological
impact
and
it
will,
i
think,
inhibit
the
flexibility,
that
i
think
is
so
essential.
so,
in
answer
to
your
question,
there
is
a
relationship,
though
is
not
an
analytically
clear
one.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i’d
like
to
turn
briefly
to
the
statutory
interpretation
question.
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
should
note
to
your
benefit
i
think,
that
the
issue
turns
not
on
the
section
that
you
had
read,
it
turns
on
section
8506
of
title
5,
which
set
forth
at
our
brief,
at
pages
31
and
32.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that's
right,
that’s
the
one
that
requires
the
federal
employing
agency
to
respond
to
a
request
from
a
state
agency,
by
giving
the
findings,
as
what
the
word
is.
now,
that
the
issue
really
turns
on
whether
findings
implies
a
hearing.
it
seems
to
me
plain
that
the
findings
doesn’t
have
that
implication.
what
it
means
here
is
simply
a
determination
after
an
inquiry.
it
has
no
implication
one
way
or
the
other
as
to
the
form
that
inquiry
would
take.
and,
you
know
when
congress
has
had
a
desire
to
require
a
hearing,
it
is
not
difficult
to
do
so
ambiguously
and
i
should
mention
in
the
very
next
section,
in
8507,
which
is
not
reprinted
in
the
briefs,
8507
deals
with
the
right
of
a
state
agency
or
the
secretary
of
labor
to
recoup
compensation
paid
to
an
employee
who
made
a
false
statement,
if
he
first
finds
that
there
has
been
a
false
statement
made.
now,
what
that
says
is
“a
finding
by
a
state
agency
or
the
secretary
maybe
made
only
after
an
opportunity
for
a
fair
hearing.”
in
the
very
next
section,
using
the
exact
same
words,
they
found
it
necessary
to
add
only
after
a
hearing.
i
think
that
makes
it
quite
clear
that
congress
did
not
contemplate
it,
that
there
necessarily
be
a
hearing
preceding
the
findings
that
are
referred
to
8506.
mr.
larson
is
correct
in
saying
that
we
do
not
say
this
is
the
only
possible
interpretation
of
the
statute.
i
think
a
lot
of
the
policy
of
unemployment
statutes
that
the
appellants
set
forth
in
their
brief
may
well
give
this
court
the
option
if
it
came
to
that
of
reading
the
statute
to
require
a
hearing,
if
it
was
necessary
to
preserve
its
constitutionality.
the
point
is
however,
that
this
a
reading
of
the
statute
by
the
agency
principally
responsible
for
administering
it,
that
we
think
it’s
permissible
and
that
we
think
ought
to
be
respective,
unless
there’s
a
constitutional
problem.
there
are
really
two
constitutional
issues
here,
one
is
a
due
process
issue
and
one
is
an
equal
protection
issue
and
our
position
is
that
in
neither
argument
is
valid.
to
start
with
a
due
process
issue,
we
believe
that
the
due
process
clause
is
not
even
implicated.
it
provides
that
there
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
life,
liberty
or
property
without
due
process
of
law.
there’s
no
question
that
the
appellants
have
not
been
deprived
of
life.
they
don’t
assert
that
they’ve
been
deprived
of
liberty,
and
so
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
property
right
at
stake.
our
position
is
that
the
property
right
in
unemployment
compensation
benefits,
like
the
right
to
continued
employment
in
the
roth
case
is
defined
by
the
rules
and
understandings,
under
which
the
benefit
is
granted.
in
roth,
the
rules
and
understandings
where
contained
in
the
terms
of
the
appointment.
in
this
case,
the
rules
and
understanding
are
contained
within
the
terms
of
the
statutes
in
governing
regulations.
and,
those
statutes
and
governing
regulations
made
clear
that
the
procedures
available
for
correcting
errors
is
the
only
procedure
and
that
is
the
only
way,
one
can
correct
errors
that
they
find
are
made.
so,
when
one
seeks
unemployment
compensation
benefits,
one
seeks
them
with
the
understanding,
that
if
there
are
errors
in
the
federal
findings,
they
can
be
corrected
by
one
method
and
one
method
only.
in
these
circumstance,
there
is
no
property
right,
unless
the
procedures
that
are
specified
have
some
sense
been
denied
to
the
person.
i
can
think
of
one
example
that
might
serve
to
make
the
point,
suppose
at
congress
enacted
a
statute
granting
benefits
to
victims
of
crime,
provided
that
the
administrator
should
first
find
on
the
basis
of
an
application
that
has
been
submitted
and
on
the
basis
of
certified
hospital
and
police
records
that
in
fact,
the
person
was
injured
in
the
course
of
a
violent
crime.
and,
supposed
further,
that
the
administrator’s
determination
were
made
unreviewable,
except
that
the
applicant
after
a
denial
of
his
application,
might
inquire
further
of
the
administrator,
as
to
the
further--as
the
basis
of
the
denial
and
might
seek
reconsideration.
now,
this
is
basically
what
we
have
here,
and
i
think
it’s
clear
that
there
would
be
no
due
process
right,
no
legitimate
entitlement
that
an
applicant
who
had
been
injured,
who
claimed
to
be
have
been
injured
in
a
course
of
a
violent
crime,
would
have
to
a
due
process
hearing
before
the
denial.
this
is
because
the
right,
as
congress
has
to
find
it,
includes
only
the
procedures
of
congress
has
specified.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
mr.
justice
stewart
that
language
comes
from,
i
believe,
title
42,
which
is
the
social
security
act,
which
of
course
does
set
up
the
standards,
by
which
the
secretary
will
approve
state
unemployment
compensation
plans,
but
that
is
quite
different
than
the
statutory
scheme
that
was
created
from
unemployment
compensation
for
federal
employees.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right,
except
that
the
statute
quite
clearly
said
that
the
information
that
is
submitted
to
the
state
agency
by
the
federal
employing
agency
shall
be
binding
and
conclusive.
there
is
no
ambiguity
about
that,
there
maybe
some
ambiguity
about
whether
the
federal
government
needs
first
to
give
them
hearing,
before
they
transmit
the
findings
or
after
they’ve
transmitted
their
findings.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
that’s
right.
it’s
--
the
statutory
scheme
that’s
been
set
up
for
the
federal
employees
makes
special
provision
for
this.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
it
says
the
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
the
findings
made
--
mr.
mark
l.
evans
i’m
sorry
on
page
32
of
our
brief,
which
is
section
8506,
towards
the
middle
of
the
page.
findings
made
in
accordance
with
the
regulations
are
final
and
conclusive
for
the
purpose
of
section
850
--
now,
there
is
no
question
that
the
findings
here
were
made
in
accordance
with
the
regulations.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
well,
there
is
a
statutory
question,
i’ve
dealt
with
that.
but,
assuming
that
the
secretary’s
reading
is
correct,
and
that
or
permissible,
i
should
say.
and,
that
the
findings
needn’t
be
predicated
upon
a
hearing.
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
congress
has
made
it
clear
that
they’ve
defined
the
right
to
make
with
the
condition
that
these
findings
will
be
conclusive
enough,
be
open
for
further
litigation.
i’d
like
to
touch
very
briefly
on
the
equal
protection
arguments.
there
has
been
suggestion
that
there
is
a
constitutional
impermissible
discrimination
between
state
employees
and
private
employees
who
are
given
full
benefits.
and,
between
probationary
federal
employees
who
were
not
given
full
benefits.
but
again,
these
statutes
had
been
setup
different
times,
for
different
purposes
and
it
seems
to
me
our
perfectly
proper
for
congress
to
draw,
to
strike
a
different
balance
in
the
context
of
federally
funded
benefits,
when
you’re
dealing
with
federal
employing
agency.
the
congress
might
reasonably
determine
that
it
was
too
much
of
a
burden
on
the
federal
government
to
require
it
to
respond
with
hearings,
in
every
case.
and,
especially
where
they
are
giving
us
an
alternative.
and,
at
least
on
its
face,
so
far
as
we
can
tell
from
this
case,
an
adequate
way
of
correcting
the
errors
might
have
been
made.
mr.
mark
l.
evans
yes,
it
is,
shortly
after
the
smith
case
was
decided
the
secretary
of
labor
amended
his
regulations
to
provide
that
an
employee
who
has
resigned,
a
probationary
employee,
who
has
resigned
and
who
disputes
the
findings
of
the
federal
employing
agency
may
have
a
hearing.
now,
there
is
a
reason
for
that
too.
in
the
case
of
a
discharged
employee,
there
is
no
question
as
to
what
the
reasons
were,
i
mean
it’s
within
the
federal
government’s
competence
to
know
what
it
was
in
it’s
own
mind
when
it
discharged
an
employee.
when
an
employee
resigns
however,
for
example,
if
he
resigns
saying
that
he
resigned,
because
it
was
too
cold
to
work
in
that
building,
and
the
fact
is
from
the
federal
standpoint
that
he
was
resigned
three
days
after
he
was
told
he
was
going
to
be
terminated
or
might
be
terminated.
there's
no
way
to
resolve
definitively
what
was
in
the
employee’s
mind.
and,
if
he
wishes
to
commit
in
that
point
and
show
that
what
is
in
his
mind
is
that
the
room
was
cold,
that’s
available
to
him,
under
the
regulations.
there’s
one
other,
of
course,
one
other
distinction
that
is
between
the
treatment
of
probationary
employees
and
permanent
employees.
and,
i
think
that
the
difference
is
they’re
relate
not
to
the
statute,
which
gives
them
no
permanent
employees,
no
greater
rights
to
hearing,
to
prevent
to
the
findings
are
final
and
conclusive.
but,
it
relates
to
their
different
civil
service
status,
they
have
a
right
to
hearing
with
respect
to
their
continued
tenure
and
if
it
turns
out
after
that
hearing
that
the
findings
needed
to
be
corrected,
well
the
regulations
specified
that
the
agency
must
correct
findings
if
it
determines
that
there
was
an
error
within
a
year.
but,
the
purpose
of
the
hearing
is
not
to
challenge
the
findings
for
unemployment
compensation,
but
solely
to
challenge
the
validity
of
the
discharge.
so
again,
if
there's
a
distinction
between
them
and
in
light
of
all
these,
we
submit
that
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
