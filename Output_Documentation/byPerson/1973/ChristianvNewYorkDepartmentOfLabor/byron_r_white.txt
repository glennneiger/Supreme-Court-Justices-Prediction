justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
that
you
should
have
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
that
cause
existed?
let's
assume
the
unemployment
people
say
“you
were
discharged
for
cause.”
and
is
the
issue
whether
the
government
said
you
were
discharged
or
cause
or
as
a
matter
of
fact
whether
that
was
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
agree
that
the
government
may
discharge
a
probationary
employee,
for
no
cause
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
must
agree
also
that
they
could
discharge
him
for
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
just
saying
“you
were
late
yesterday.”
justice
byron
r.
white
and
discharged
him,
whether
it’s
true
or
false.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that’s
the
reason
they
discharged
him,
you
say
there
must
be
a
hearing
to
go
behind
that
statement
at
the
unemployment
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
then
i
gather
you
say
the
hearing
you
require
then
really
is
something
that
you
can’t
get
satisfied
just
by
a
paper
record.
you
think
you
must
have
--
justice
byron
r.
white
have
a
witness
and
an
impartial
confrontation,
impartial
hearing
officer,
etcetera?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
the
statutory
procedure
that
were
available
would
be
enough
for
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
that
is
at
the
discharge
state,
but
how
about
at
the
employment
stage?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
any
way,
whatever
hearing
they
provide,
where
it’s
available,
that
hearing
is
enough
for
your
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let
me
say
if
i
understand,
if
this
were
a
state
employee,
at
the
initial
stage,
whatever
form
that
hearing
takes,
the
determination
by
the
hearing
examiner
would
be
what?
there
was
a
cause,
or
there
was
not
cause,
which?
justice
byron
r.
white
at
the
initial
stage,
is
a
dismissal
in
the
state
service.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
what
would
he
decide?
there
was
cause
or
was
not
cause,
which?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
that’s
what
he
would
decide.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
he
--
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
and
if
he
decided
there
was
cause,
whatever
it
may
have
been,
and
then
she
be
an
eligible
for
unemployment
compensation?
justice
byron
r.
white
whereas
if
he
said
“there
was
no
cause”
and
then
she
would
be
eligible
at
that
stage,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then,
the
next
step
is
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
the
fair
hearing,
at
which
the
issue
was
the
same,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
just
the
different
procedure?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
state
agencies
handling
a
federal
employee,
accept
the
certification
of
the
federal
official
there
was
cause,
period,
in
that
statement.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
at
both
stages?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
i
was
asking
particularly
mr.
larson,
42
u.s.c.
503
says
that
“the
secretarial
labor
makes
no
certification,
unless
he
finds
the
law
of
the
state
provides
opportunity
for
a
fair
hearing
before
an
impartial
tribunal
for
all
individuals
whose
claims
for
unemployment
compensation
are
denied.”
and,
my
question
was
is
that
the
statute
in
which
you
rely?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
of
course
is
all
of
paper
proceeding.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
that
we
suggest
is
at
least
as
good
as
the
initial
statement.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
what’s
this
mean,
affirm,
modify,
or
reverse
any
or
all
of
its
federal
findings
in
writing,
so
it
affirms
in
what’s
it
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
say,
we
modify
it’s
more
elaborate
or
let’s
say
reverse,
i
suppose,
it’s
still
more
like
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
if
they
affirm
to
send
the
same
old
slip
back
to
the
state
that’s
the
end
of
the
matter,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
may
not
go
behind
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
so
at
least
the
so-called
full
due
process
hearing
is
not
available
to
this
area.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
can't
be
heard
to
complain,
unless
he’s
at
least
exhausted
these
first.
justice
byron
r.
white
were
you
involved
in
the,
not
you
but
--
justice
byron
r.
white
oh?
you
are?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course
mr.
evans,
your
argument,
this
argument
and
not
exhaustion,
no
matter
how
i
gather
your
position
is,
no
matter
how
meritorious
the
due
process
times
maybe,
not
entitled
to
have
a
determined
here,
because
they
didn’t
exhaust
