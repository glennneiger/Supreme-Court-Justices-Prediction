is
he
the
sky
marshal
took
a
drink
within
24
hours
before
he
had
to
fly?
unknown
speaker
it
was
observed
to
happen.
unknown
speaker
you
haven’t
addressed
the
statutory
argument,
but
i
gather
that
both
things
on
pliable
one
to
apply
on
three-judges?
unknown
speaker
what
about
1337?
unknown
speaker
of
course
you
can’t
stipulate
to
it
(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
know
whether
you
reached
this,
but
i
would
like
to
have
it
clarified.
i
am
looking
at
bottom
of
page
11
of
the
(inaudible)
brief.
i’d
like
to
read
you
a
sentence,
the
last
sentence.
“the
consequence
of
permitting
probationary
employers
to
litigate
the
reasons
for
their
discharge,
are
extensively
merely
to
determine
their
eligibility
of
unemployment
benefits
would
be
to
overturn
the
settle
principle
that
a
probationary
employee
does
not
have
the
right
to
contest
the
propriety
of
his
discharge.”
i
take
it
back
then
is
that
the
principle
that
you
say
is
settled
and
is
conceded
by
your
opponent
is
that
a
probationary
employee
maybe
discharged
even
without
cause,
and
with
or
without
a
hearing,
no
hearing
as
a
matter
of
fact.
and
i
understand
your
brief
to
say
that
if
we
decide
the
case
against
the
government
on
this
issue
that
this
will
then
become
a
precedent
that
will
overturn
the
settled
practice
with
respect
to
the
discharge
of
probationary
employees.
now,
if
that
so
please
tell
me
why?
unknown
speaker
that’s
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
evens,
do
i
understand
the
agency
has
now
gone
along
with
the
district
of
columbia
decision
of
the
smith
case,
is
it?
unknown

is
