mr.
e.
richard
larson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
with
the
three-judge
district
court,
one
judge
dissenting
from
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
issue
here
involves
questions
of
due
process,
equal
protection,
and
statutory
construction.
the
issue
here
stated
specifically
is
whether
consistent
with
the
statutory
and
constitutional
framework
of
unemployment
compensation.
a
former
or
a
federal
agency
may
deny
compensation,
unemployment
compensation
to
a
former
federal
probationary
employee,
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
employing
agency’s
statement
of
its
reasons
for
discharging
the
former
employee,
without
that
employee
ever
being
provided
with
an
opportunity
for
a
fair
hearing,
at
which
the
employee
may
contest
the
reasons
for
which
he
has
been
denied
unemployment
compensation.
stated
more
simply,
the
issue
is
simply
is
whether
unemployment
compensation
maybe
denied
without
any
hearing,
at
any
time
on
the
basic
reasons
for
the
denial
of
compensation.
this
case
arises
within
the
context
of
the
jointly
administered
state
and
federal
unemployment
compensation
program,
a
program
through
which
the
states
administer
the
payment
of
unemployment
compensation
to
all
covered
employees,
pursuant
to
various
federal
requirements.
one
of
those
federal
statutory
requirements
is
the
requirement
that
a
fair
hearing
before
an
impartial
tribunal
be
provided
to
all
individuals
whose
claims
for
compensation
are
denied.
this
case
arises
from
the
appellee’s
interpretation
of
one
of
the
unemployment
compensation
statutes,
a
section
of
the
social
security
act
countrified
as
5
u.s.c.
section
8506
(a).
pursuant
to
the
appellee’s
interpretation
of
this
particular
statute,
a
federal
agency’s
ex
parte
statement
of
its
reasons
for
discharging
a
probationary
employee
are
final
and
conclusive
upon
the
state
unemployment
compensation
agency
and
accordingly
may
not
be
reviewed
by
the
state
in
the
fair
hearing,
which
is
provided
by
the
state.
this
interpretation
should
be
noted
at
the
outset
is
directly
contrary
to
the
statutory
interpretation
provided
by
the
case
of
smith
v.
district
unemployment
compensation
board,
a
case
decided
more
than
three
years
ago
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
appellee’s
interpretation,
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
is
best
illustrated
by
describing
the
facts
relevant
to
the
denial
of
compensation
to
appellant
christian
in
this
case.
appellant
christian
was
discharged
by
her
employer,
the
post
office
during
her
probationary
period,
on
the
grounds
allegedly
of
having
an
unsatisfactory
attendance
record,
specifically
that
she
had
not
reported
her
absences
to
her
employer
during
a
period,
when
she
was
on
a
restricted
sick
leave
list.
well,
since
appellant
christian
was
not
a
permanent
employee,
she
was
not
eligible
for
a
termination
hearing.
this
is
not
something
that
is
contested
in
this
case
at
all,
we
can
see
she
is
not
eligible
for
termination
hearing
and
do
not
seek
a
termination
hearing.
similarly
however,
since
she
had
not
resigned
her
federal
employment,
she
was
not
provided
with
an
unemployment
compensation
fair
hearing
for
purposes
of
unemployment
compensation.
she
was
however
basically
eligible
for
compensation,
because
she
had
worked
the
minimum
amount
of
time
and
earned
a
minimum
amount
of
remuneration
in
order
to
have
her
contractual
right
to
unemployment
compensation.
the
contractual
right,
which
this
court
recognized
in
the
case
of
california
department
of
human
resources
v.
java
at
402
u.s.
accordingly,
she
applied
for
compensation
through
a
claims
examiner
at
the
new
york
state
department
of
labor.
a
claims
examiner
normally
obtains
information,
both
from
the
claimant
and
from
the
former
employer
and
makes
an
impartial
decision
on
the
information
that
is
received
relevant
to
such
issues
as
reasons
for
termination
of
employment.
in
this
case
however,
the
claims
examiner
felt
himself
bound
by
federal
appellee’s
interpretation
of
the
statute
at
issue
here
and
accordingly,
after
receiving
the
ex
parte
statement
of
the
reasons
for
discharging
appellant
christian,
the
claims
examiner
denied
compensation
to
appellant
christian
on
the
grounds
of
those
that
ex
parte
statements.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
if
the
appellant
had
been
a
new
york
state
employee,
and
particularly
a
probationary
state
employee,
the
appellant
would’ve
been
treated
as
or
private
employee.
the
claims
examiner
would
have
obtained
information
from
the
state
of
new
york,
concerning
the
reasons
for
discharge
and
information
from
he
claimant
himself
or
herself
and
on
the
basis
of
that
information,
the
claims
examiner
would’ve
made
a
fair
determination
as
to
the
reasons
for
discharge
for
purposes
of
compensation.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
oh!
very
definitely
your
honor,
i
should
point
out
that--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
yes,
it
is.
permanent
and
probationary,
private
employees
and
permanent
and
probationary
state
employees,
permanent
and
probationary
federal
employees
who
resigned,
and
all
permanent
federal
employees
receive
this
fair
determination
through
an
opportunity
for
fair
a
hearing
for
purposes
of
unemployment
compensation.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
through
the
federal
form,
through
their
termination
hearings.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
because
of
their
status
as
permanent
employees.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that
is
the
initial
determination
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--
which
you
described
in
the
java
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
subsequent
to
the
initial
determination
procedure
as
it
is
illustrated
by
the
facts
of
appellant
christian
here,
if
the
initial
of
termination
is
adverse
to
the
claimant,
social
security
act
requires
that
a
state
must
provide
an
opportunity
for
fair
hearing
for
an
impartial
tribunal--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
well
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
at
this
stage,
yes
i’m
getting
to
the
hearing,
because
something
significant
happened
at
this
hearing,
with
regard
to
appellant
christian
and
that
is
that
although
the
appellee’s
interpretation
of
the
statute
issue
here,
requires
the
fair
hearing
referee
at
the
second
stage,
now
requires
the
fair
hearing
referee
to
accept
that
ex
parte
statement
of
reasons
by
the
federal
agency
as
final
and
conclusive.
the
hearing
referee
in
this
case,
after
hearing
the
evidence
submitted
orally
on
the
issue
of
termination
by
appellant
christian
and
after
having
received
the
statement
from
the
post
office,
submitted
in
lieu
of
appearance
through
the
industrial
commissioner.
the
hearing
referee
here
disregarded
the
appellee’s
interpretation
of
the
statute,
and
in
fact
did
make
a
fair
findings
on
the
issue
that
was
before
the
referee.
now,
this
was
a
very
short
lived
fair
determination
procedure,
because
the
state
immediately
appealed
this
fair
finding
as
fair
determination
procedure
to
the
state
appeal
board
and
the
state
appeal
board
reversed
on
the
grounds
that
the
state
had
to
accept
the
federal
reasons
as
final
and
conclusive,
so
it
is
a
two-step
process.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
she
gets
neither.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
it’s
certainly
as
not
a
fair
determination.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
for
example
in
java
this
court
noted
that
the
word
“do”
in
section
503
of
the
social
security
act
met
after
the
first
time
when
both
parties
could
be
heard
in
an
impartial
decision
rendered
that
was
the
initial
determination
procedure.
that
as
a
fair
process,
as
reached
in
java
never
occurs
with
regard
to
federal
probation
or
employee.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
there’s
no
argument.
this
is
acceptable.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
before
i
turn
into
the
due
process,
and
the
equal
protection,
and
the
statutory
construction
issues
in
this
case,
i’d
like
to
reiterate
a
couple
of
points
about
what
this
case
is
about
and
what
it
is
not
about.
and
this
is
particulary
in
light
of
the
briefs
submitted
by
the
federal
appellees
in
this
case.
the
hearing
which
is
sought
in
this
case
and
which
we
contend
as
constitutional
and
statutorily
required
is
unemployment
compensation
hearing
for
purposes
unemployment
compensation.
the
appellants
do
not
seek
a
termination
hearing,
they
do
not
seek
reemployment,
rather
all
is
sought
here
is
a
fair
determination
procedure
through
a
fair
hearing
for
purposes
of
unemployment
compensation.
now,
second
the
provision
of
a
fair
hearing
for
purposes
of
unemployment
compensation
to
the
appellants
here
would
have
no
affect
whatsoever
upon
the
federal
discharge
procedures
with
regard
to
probationary
employees.
it
is
conceded
on
the
record,
indeed
the
federal
regulations
provide
and
we
do
not
challenge
them
that
a
federal
probationary
employee
maybe
discharged
without
cause,
during
his
probationary
period.
accordingly,
if
there
maybe
a
discharge
without
cause,
a
subsequent
hearing
for
purposes
of
unemployment
compensation,
which
merely
review
the
reasons
or
the
lack
of
reasons
for
the
discharge
could
have
no
effect
upon
the
discharge
procedures
for
that
employee.
now
thirdly,
the
issue
here,
the
unemployment
compensation
issue
at
the
hearings,
the
reasons
for
termination
as
this
court
noted
in
java
the
reasons
for
termination
constitute
the
most
frequently
disputed
issue
in
unemployment
compensation.
and,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
note
8
on
page
10
more
than
60%
of
the
claims
in
the
state
of
new
york
that
reached
the
fair
hearing
referee
involved
issues
concerning
reasons
for
termination,
so
it
is
a
frequently
disputed
issue
on
our
employment
compensation
and
this
is
what
is
being
denied
to
the
appellants
here.
now
fourth,
we
have
contended
and
we
continue
to
contend
that
the
fair
hearing,
which
we
say
is
required
both
constitutionally
and
statutorily
maybe
provided
either
by
the
federal
appellees
or
by
the
state
appellees.
now,
particularly
relevant
here
is
the
circuit
court
of
appeal’s
decision
in
smith.
what
happens
in
smith
is
that
the
panel
composed
of
judges
leventhall,
fahy,
and
robb
said
that
in
the
first
instance
the
federal
agencies
or
the
civil
service
commission
could
provide
the
hearing
for
purposes
of
unemployment
compensation
to
the
federal
employees.
but,
if
the
federal
agencies
of
civil
service
commission
did
not
provide
the
hearing,
in
that
case
the
state
mechanism,
the
unemployment
compensation
agency
mechanism
for
fair
hearing,
which
is
already
in
existence
and
which
provides
fair
hearings
to
all
other
employees
should
be
made
available
and
would
be
made
available
for
the
federal
employees
in
a
similar
matter.
in
other
words,
the
fair
hearing
could
be
provided
either
at
the
state
level
or
at
the
federal
level.
the
fifth,
the
smith
case,
which
they
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
well,
the
issue
is
whether
there
was
cause,
whether
it
was
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
cause.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
right.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
certainly,
they
may.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
correct.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
right.
in
that
situation
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
well,
the
way
the
system
operates
right
now
pursuant
to
the
apellee’s
interpretation
of
the
statute,
whatever
reason
the
federal
appellees
give
or
the
federal
agency
gives
is
final,
conclusive,
and
can
never
be
reviewed.
for
instance,
the
federal
agency
may
say
you
were
late
yesterday.
in
appellant
christian’s
case
the
facts
were
very
similar
to
that,
where
"you
were
absent
yesterday
and
you
did
not
call
in."
appellant
christian
said,
“my
older
daughter
did
call
in
and
she
advised
me
that
she
did
so
and
i
had
her
do
so."
"the
telephone
in
my
apartment
does
not
work.”
there
were
underlying
facts
as
to
whether
or
not
she
did
call
in,
and
which
is
a
crucial
determination
because
the
state
applies
its
state
law
as
to
whether
as
misconduct
(voice
overlap)
mr.
e.
richard
larson
oh!
certainly
not.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
in
our
due
process
claim
of
course,
we
alleged
that
the
requisites,
the
fundamental
requisites
of
due
process.
the
normal
requisite
elements
of
a
due
process
hearing
should
be
provided.
but,
then
i
think
i
can
illustrate
with
the
plaintiffs
here.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
the
procedure
with
regard
to
the
state
procedure.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
i
should
note
here
that
the
state
procedure,
as
well
as
the
federal
procedure
with
regard
to
terminating
a
federal
employees.
the
elements
of
the
hearings
are
basically
the
due
process
elements.
there
is
an
impartial
hearing
examiner.
there
is
a
requirement
that
decision
must
be
based
upon
the
evidence
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
this
is
also
present
at
the
unemployment
stage.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
yes.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
i
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
in
the
state
situation,
the
hearing
examiner
would
base
its
determination
upon
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
it
depends
upon
the
facts
before
him.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that’s
what
would
he
decide.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
decide
the
facts
before
him.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
at
that
stage,
yes.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
right.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
fair
hearing
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that
is
correct.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
it’s
a
more
elaborative
procedure,
where
there
is
an
opportunity
for
cross
examination
and
confrontation
of
witnesses,
their
seeking
the
power.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that’s
final
and
conclusive,
nothing
more.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
at
both
stages.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
section
8501,
which
provides
the
basic
coverage
of
the
law,
specifically
accepts
from
coverage
certain
federal
employees.
it
does
accept
that
type
of
federal
employee.
it
was
on
the
contract
or
fee
basis.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
so,
that
person
would
not
be
covered.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
your
question
mr.
chief
justice.
if
he
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
well,
the
unemployment
compensation
is
not
available
to
the
latter
employee.
if
it
were
available
to
the
latter
employee,
who
were
on
a
contract
basis,
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
a
resignation.
basically,
a
resignation
situation
or
it
maybe
interpreted
as
a
lay-off.
but
if
it
is
lay-off,
then
the
person
would
be
eligible.
but,
this
is
a
factor,
which
under
state
law
or
with
regard
to
all
state
employees,
private
employees,
federal
permanent
employees
is
fairly
decided,
if
there
are
factual
issues.
it
is
fairly
decided
for
those
employees,
but
if
it’s
a
federal
probationary
employee,
it
is
not
fairly
decided
with
federal
reasons
are
automatically
accepted
as
binding
and
conclusive.
with
regard
to
the
due
process
argument,
most
of
the
due
process
cases,
which
come
before
this
court
of
course,
concern
the
finer
issues
of
due
process,
with
regard
to
the
timing
of
the
hearing
or
the
form
of
the
specific
elements
of
the
hearing.
here,
of
course
the
issue
is
much
more
basic,
since
there
is
no
hearing
at
anytime,
yet
this
contractual
right
is
taken
away
from
the
appellants.
here
there
is
no
impartial
decision
maker,
there
is
no
decision
to
be
based
upon
the
evidence,
there
is
no
oral
presentation
of
evidence,
no
oral
argument,
no
right
to
representation,
no
confrontation
or
cross
examination,
none
of
these
elements
are
here.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
no,
i
think
should
i
point
out
that
tori
of
course,
as
in
the
bernie
case
the
prior
hearing
cases
which
were
at
issue
here,
already
provided
the
precise
procedures,
which
we
are
seeking
here.
the
issue
in
tori
and
bernie
was
a
prior
hearing.
what
was
required
prior
to
the
termination
of
benefits,
but
as
required
by
statute,
as
mr.
chief
justice
asked,
the
procedure
that
we're
seeking
here
was
required
to
be
provided
in
tori’s
and
in
bernie’s
the
initial
fair
and
initial
termination,
and
the
fair
hearing
procedure
later.
that
was
not
an
issue
in
bernie
or
tori’s
that
was
already
statutorily
provided.
this
is
not
a
prior
hearing
case,
this
is
just
a
hearing,
there
is
no
hearing,
no
fairness
in
this
procedure
at
all,
as
the
apellees
state
at
page
17
of
their
brief,
all
they
find,
all
they
determined,
they
state
that
it’s
merely
a
statement
of
the
agency’s
reasons
for
discharging
the
employee
that’s
all
there
is.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
at
all.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that’s
provided
for
in
the
statutes
and
we
do
not
challenge
that
statutory
scheme
of
having
an
initial
determination
procedure,
which
is
not
a
full
blown
hearing.
we
do
not
challenge
the
absence
of
full
blown
hearing
procedures
of
the
initial
stage,
because
there
is
a
later
statutory
hearing.
here,
there
is
never
any
statutory
hearing,
nor
is
there
even
a
fair
initial
determination
process.
i
think
this
can
be
the
lack
of
one
of
the
essential
elements
of
a
due
process
here
in
confrontation
and
cross
examination
is
particularly
well
illustrated
by
appellant
green’s
case.
appellant
green
was
discharged
by
his
employer,
the
treasury
department,
as
noted
on
page
52
of
the
appendix,
“as
you
were
observed”
engaging
in
such,
and
such
alleged
misconduct.
now,
appellant
green
never
new
with
this
observer
was.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
yes,
now
it
is
alleged
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
he
was
observed
to
have
been
drinking
and
the
observation
is
a
matter
of
fact
occurred
more
or
alleged
to
have
occurred
more
than
3
½
months
prior
to
his
termination.
in
other
words,
if--well,
he
was
not
terminated
immediately
after
this
alleged
event
took
place,
rather
they
waited.
it
was
six
days
before
the
end
of
his
probationary
period
at
which
he
was
terminated
for
this
alleged
observation,
which
took
place
3
½
months
before.
now,
of
course,
appellant
green
was
allowed
no
opportunity
for
confrontation
or
cross
examination
of
this
unknown
observer,
this
element
was
completely
absent
as
are
the
other
elements
of
a
fair
hearing.
there’s
no
procedure,
there’s
no
requirement
for
a
fair
hearing
examine
or
fair
decision
maker,
instead
the
decision
maker
here
is
conceded
to
be
the
agency,
a
bias
party.
indeed,
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
decision
be
based
upon
the
evidence.
instead
all
that
we
have
is
the
ex
parte’s
statement
of
the
reasons
by
the
federal
agency.
this
procedure
we
submit
is
a
one
sided
determination
of
facts,
the
size
of
contractual
right.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
the
statutory
argument
is
based
on,
i
guess
many
different
factors,
but
the
outset
we
would
look
at
the
powell
decision
in
the
smith
case.
and
what
they
did
of
course
is
they
looked
at
unemployment
compensation
generally.
the
right
to
a
fair
hearing
that
this
is
a
very
important
right
in
the
unemployment
compensation
statutory
scheme,
and
that
this
fair
hearing
cannot
be
lightly
taken
away.
now
of
course,
the
appellees
in
this
case
do
not
contend
that
their
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
necessarily
the
only
interpretation
of
the
statute.
all
they
contend
is
that
the
secretary
has
grabbed
the
authority
to
make
whatever
fact-finding
procedure
it
chooses
to
make.
and,
it
here
chose
not
to
provide
for
fairness
or
for
hearing
procedures.
we
contend
it,
as
long
as
they
concede
that
their
construction
is
not
one
that
they
contend
the
statutorily
required.
indeed,
the
contrary
interpretation
is
required
that
a
fair
hearing
must
be
provided
here.
also,
what
is
significant
we
hinge
on
the
word
“finding,”
the
congress
used
the
word
“findings,”
they
did
not
use
another
word.
this
is
a
contextual
word
and
in
the
context
of
unemployment
compensation,
the
word
“findings”
is
very
fairly
mean,
can
mean
findings
after
a
hearing.
additionally,
we
looked
very
strongly
to
the
dominant
legislative
theme
of
providing
unemployment
compensation
to
federal
employees,
that
dominant
scheme
is
simply
to
make
employees
equal
to
stay
in
private
employees.
provide
them
with
the
same
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
as
provided
to
other
employees.
so,
i
should
note
that
this
court
need
not
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional,
that
the
proper
statutory
construction
here
does
require
--
that
a
hearing
be
provided
to
the
appellants.
i
should
also
note
that
this
court
of
course
has
reviewed
many
cases
of
statutory
construction,
which
it
involved
questions
of
due
process,
where
the
due
process
considered
an
issue.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that
is
one
of
the
statutes
which
we
rely
on
very
definitely.
that
is
the
most
clear
statement
made
by
the
congress
with
regard
to
the
provision
of
fair
hearing,
but
there
are
a
host
of
other
avenues
which
lead
to
the
same
conclusion
that
a
hearing
must
be
provided.
i
noticed
my
time
has
expired,
i
would
like
to
save
whatever
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
i
do
not
think
there
is
mr.
justice
blackmun
i
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
yes,
the
district
court
did.
i
think
the
district
court
of
course
is
clearly
wrong
and
1908
decision
by
this
court
on
mandamus,
under
1361
jurisdiction
makes
clear
that
common
law
or
the
relief
available
to
common
law
mandamus
includes
corrective
orders
against
federal
officials
who
have
violated
the
constitution.
and
what
the
district
court
did
was
it
held
that
--
it
determined
there
was
no
mandamus
jurisdiction
over
the
federal
defendants
and
consequently
did
not
reach
the
constitutional
issues
as
to
federal
defendants,
but
i
would
submit
that
garfield,
a
decision
more
than
60
years
old
reached
by
this
court,
makes
clear
that
the
mandamus
remedy
extends
to
the
corrective
orders
against
unconstitutional
activity.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
i
submit
they
did
in
this
case
your
honor.
i
should
also
note
that
the
federal
district
court
dismissed
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
under
1343
(3).
now,
we
contend
through
a
joint
participation
theory
of
this
federal
state
program
that
the
federal
government
is
in
joint
participation
with
the
state
appellees
and
accordingly
are
properly
named
as
defendants
under
1343
(3).
mr.
e.
richard
larson
we
did
not
alleged
that
in
our
complaint.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
well,
that‘s
of
course
the
position
they
have
taken
in
argument
with
us,
but
you
must
remember
that
they
of
course
denied
a
fair
hearing
to
appellants
christian
and
green
in
this
case.
if
they
have
not
been
--
their
cooperation,
their
agreement
with
the
federal
defendants
or
federal
appellees
in
this
action,
a
joint
participation
which
is
clear
through
the
statute
both
section
8502
and
8504
made
clear
that
the
federal
government
assigns
all
wages,
all
claims,
to
the
state
and
that
the
state
is
to
operate
the
program.
i
think
also
a
quote
from
shapiro
v.
thompson
is
appropriate
where
the
court
stated
that
congress
is
without
power
to
compel
state
cooperation
in
a
program,
in
a
joint
federal
state
program,
which
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
this
is
a
joint
federal
state
program
and
the
unquestioned
by
this
pursuant
to
federal
law.
but,
it
is
the
state
actually,
which
has
denied
the
fair
hearing
act.
i
notice
my
time
is
up.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
if
i
may
make
one
comment
about
this
last
one?
mr.
e.
richard
larson
we
did
note
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
evans
on
page
9,
note
6
of
our
reply
brief,
this
court
held
last
term
that
were
the
adequacy
of
the
administrative
procedure
is
the
issued
to
resolve,
exhaustion
is
not
required.
thank
you.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
on
appeal
from
a
final
judgment
with
the
three-judge
district
court,
one
judge
dissenting
from
the
southern
district
of
new
york.
the
issue
here
involves
questions
of
due
process,
equal
protection,
and
statutory
construction.
the
issue
here
stated
specifically
is
whether
consistent
with
the
statutory
and
constitutional
framework
of
unemployment
compensation.
a
former
or
a
federal
agency
may
deny
compensation,
unemployment
compensation
to
a
former
federal
probationary
employee,
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
employing
agency’s
statement
of
its
reasons
for
discharging
the
former
employee,
without
that
employee
ever
being
provided
with
an
opportunity
for
a
fair
hearing,
at
which
the
employee
may
contest
the
reasons
for
which
he
has
been
denied
unemployment
compensation.
stated
more
simply,
the
issue
is
simply
is
whether
unemployment
compensation
maybe
denied
without
any
hearing,
at
any
time
on
the
basic
reasons
for
the
denial
of
compensation.
this
case
arises
within
the
context
of
the
jointly
administered
state
and
federal
unemployment
compensation
program,
a
program
through
which
the
states
administer
the
payment
of
unemployment
compensation
to
all
covered
employees,
pursuant
to
various
federal
requirements.
one
of
those
federal
statutory
requirements
is
the
requirement
that
a
fair
hearing
before
an
impartial
tribunal
be
provided
to
all
individuals
whose
claims
for
compensation
are
denied.
this
case
arises
from
the
appellee’s
interpretation
of
one
of
the
unemployment
compensation
statutes,
a
section
of
the
social
security
act
countrified
as
5
u.s.c.
section
8506
(a).
pursuant
to
the
appellee’s
interpretation
of
this
particular
statute,
a
federal
agency’s
ex
parte
statement
of
its
reasons
for
discharging
a
probationary
employee
are
final
and
conclusive
upon
the
state
unemployment
compensation
agency
and
accordingly
may
not
be
reviewed
by
the
state
in
the
fair
hearing,
which
is
provided
by
the
state.
this
interpretation
should
be
noted
at
the
outset
is
directly
contrary
to
the
statutory
interpretation
provided
by
the
case
of
smith
v.
district
unemployment
compensation
board,
a
case
decided
more
than
three
years
ago
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia.
the
appellee’s
interpretation,
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case,
is
best
illustrated
by
describing
the
facts
relevant
to
the
denial
of
compensation
to
appellant
christian
in
this
case.
appellant
christian
was
discharged
by
her
employer,
the
post
office
during
her
probationary
period,
on
the
grounds
allegedly
of
having
an
unsatisfactory
attendance
record,
specifically
that
she
had
not
reported
her
absences
to
her
employer
during
a
period,
when
she
was
on
a
restricted
sick
leave
list.
well,
since
appellant
christian
was
not
a
permanent
employee,
she
was
not
eligible
for
a
termination
hearing.
this
is
not
something
that
is
contested
in
this
case
at
all,
we
can
see
she
is
not
eligible
for
termination
hearing
and
do
not
seek
a
termination
hearing.
similarly
however,
since
she
had
not
resigned
her
federal
employment,
she
was
not
provided
with
an
unemployment
compensation
fair
hearing
for
purposes
of
unemployment
compensation.
she
was
however
basically
eligible
for
compensation,
because
she
had
worked
the
minimum
amount
of
time
and
earned
a
minimum
amount
of
remuneration
in
order
to
have
her
contractual
right
to
unemployment
compensation.
the
contractual
right,
which
this
court
recognized
in
the
case
of
california
department
of
human
resources
v.
java
at
402
u.s.
accordingly,
she
applied
for
compensation
through
a
claims
examiner
at
the
new
york
state
department
of
labor.
a
claims
examiner
normally
obtains
information,
both
from
the
claimant
and
from
the
former
employer
and
makes
an
impartial
decision
on
the
information
that
is
received
relevant
to
such
issues
as
reasons
for
termination
of
employment.
in
this
case
however,
the
claims
examiner
felt
himself
bound
by
federal
appellee’s
interpretation
of
the
statute
at
issue
here
and
accordingly,
after
receiving
the
ex
parte
statement
of
the
reasons
for
discharging
appellant
christian,
the
claims
examiner
denied
compensation
to
appellant
christian
on
the
grounds
of
those
that
ex
parte
statements.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
if
the
appellant
had
been
a
new
york
state
employee,
and
particularly
a
probationary
state
employee,
the
appellant
would’ve
been
treated
as
or
private
employee.
the
claims
examiner
would
have
obtained
information
from
the
state
of
new
york,
concerning
the
reasons
for
discharge
and
information
from
he
claimant
himself
or
herself
and
on
the
basis
of
that
information,
the
claims
examiner
would’ve
made
a
fair
determination
as
to
the
reasons
for
discharge
for
purposes
of
compensation.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
oh!
very
definitely
your
honor,
i
should
point
out
that--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
yes,
it
is.
permanent
and
probationary,
private
employees
and
permanent
and
probationary
state
employees,
permanent
and
probationary
federal
employees
who
resigned,
and
all
permanent
federal
employees
receive
this
fair
determination
through
an
opportunity
for
fair
a
hearing
for
purposes
of
unemployment
compensation.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
through
the
federal
form,
through
their
termination
hearings.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
because
of
their
status
as
permanent
employees.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that
is
the
initial
determination
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
--
which
you
described
in
the
java
case,
mr.
chief
justice.
subsequent
to
the
initial
determination
procedure
as
it
is
illustrated
by
the
facts
of
appellant
christian
here,
if
the
initial
of
termination
is
adverse
to
the
claimant,
social
security
act
requires
that
a
state
must
provide
an
opportunity
for
fair
hearing
for
an
impartial
tribunal--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
well
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
at
this
stage,
yes
i’m
getting
to
the
hearing,
because
something
significant
happened
at
this
hearing,
with
regard
to
appellant
christian
and
that
is
that
although
the
appellee’s
interpretation
of
the
statute
issue
here,
requires
the
fair
hearing
referee
at
the
second
stage,
now
requires
the
fair
hearing
referee
to
accept
that
ex
parte
statement
of
reasons
by
the
federal
agency
as
final
and
conclusive.
the
hearing
referee
in
this
case,
after
hearing
the
evidence
submitted
orally
on
the
issue
of
termination
by
appellant
christian
and
after
having
received
the
statement
from
the
post
office,
submitted
in
lieu
of
appearance
through
the
industrial
commissioner.
the
hearing
referee
here
disregarded
the
appellee’s
interpretation
of
the
statute,
and
in
fact
did
make
a
fair
findings
on
the
issue
that
was
before
the
referee.
now,
this
was
a
very
short
lived
fair
determination
procedure,
because
the
state
immediately
appealed
this
fair
finding
as
fair
determination
procedure
to
the
state
appeal
board
and
the
state
appeal
board
reversed
on
the
grounds
that
the
state
had
to
accept
the
federal
reasons
as
final
and
conclusive,
so
it
is
a
two-step
process.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
she
gets
neither.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
it’s
certainly
as
not
a
fair
determination.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
for
example
in
java
this
court
noted
that
the
word
“do”
in
section
503
of
the
social
security
act
met
after
the
first
time
when
both
parties
could
be
heard
in
an
impartial
decision
rendered
that
was
the
initial
determination
procedure.
that
as
a
fair
process,
as
reached
in
java
never
occurs
with
regard
to
federal
probation
or
employee.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
there’s
no
argument.
this
is
acceptable.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
before
i
turn
into
the
due
process,
and
the
equal
protection,
and
the
statutory
construction
issues
in
this
case,
i’d
like
to
reiterate
a
couple
of
points
about
what
this
case
is
about
and
what
it
is
not
about.
and
this
is
particulary
in
light
of
the
briefs
submitted
by
the
federal
appellees
in
this
case.
the
hearing
which
is
sought
in
this
case
and
which
we
contend
as
constitutional
and
statutorily
required
is
unemployment
compensation
hearing
for
purposes
unemployment
compensation.
the
appellants
do
not
seek
a
termination
hearing,
they
do
not
seek
reemployment,
rather
all
is
sought
here
is
a
fair
determination
procedure
through
a
fair
hearing
for
purposes
of
unemployment
compensation.
now,
second
the
provision
of
a
fair
hearing
for
purposes
of
unemployment
compensation
to
the
appellants
here
would
have
no
affect
whatsoever
upon
the
federal
discharge
procedures
with
regard
to
probationary
employees.
it
is
conceded
on
the
record,
indeed
the
federal
regulations
provide
and
we
do
not
challenge
them
that
a
federal
probationary
employee
maybe
discharged
without
cause,
during
his
probationary
period.
accordingly,
if
there
maybe
a
discharge
without
cause,
a
subsequent
hearing
for
purposes
of
unemployment
compensation,
which
merely
review
the
reasons
or
the
lack
of
reasons
for
the
discharge
could
have
no
effect
upon
the
discharge
procedures
for
that
employee.
now
thirdly,
the
issue
here,
the
unemployment
compensation
issue
at
the
hearings,
the
reasons
for
termination
as
this
court
noted
in
java
the
reasons
for
termination
constitute
the
most
frequently
disputed
issue
in
unemployment
compensation.
and,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
note
8
on
page
10
more
than
60%
of
the
claims
in
the
state
of
new
york
that
reached
the
fair
hearing
referee
involved
issues
concerning
reasons
for
termination,
so
it
is
a
frequently
disputed
issue
on
our
employment
compensation
and
this
is
what
is
being
denied
to
the
appellants
here.
now
fourth,
we
have
contended
and
we
continue
to
contend
that
the
fair
hearing,
which
we
say
is
required
both
constitutionally
and
statutorily
maybe
provided
either
by
the
federal
appellees
or
by
the
state
appellees.
now,
particularly
relevant
here
is
the
circuit
court
of
appeal’s
decision
in
smith.
what
happens
in
smith
is
that
the
panel
composed
of
judges
leventhall,
fahy,
and
robb
said
that
in
the
first
instance
the
federal
agencies
or
the
civil
service
commission
could
provide
the
hearing
for
purposes
of
unemployment
compensation
to
the
federal
employees.
but,
if
the
federal
agencies
of
civil
service
commission
did
not
provide
the
hearing,
in
that
case
the
state
mechanism,
the
unemployment
compensation
agency
mechanism
for
fair
hearing,
which
is
already
in
existence
and
which
provides
fair
hearings
to
all
other
employees
should
be
made
available
and
would
be
made
available
for
the
federal
employees
in
a
similar
matter.
in
other
words,
the
fair
hearing
could
be
provided
either
at
the
state
level
or
at
the
federal
level.
the
fifth,
the
smith
case,
which
they
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
well,
the
issue
is
whether
there
was
cause,
whether
it
was
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
cause.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
right.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
certainly,
they
may.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
correct.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
right.
in
that
situation
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
well,
the
way
the
system
operates
right
now
pursuant
to
the
apellee’s
interpretation
of
the
statute,
whatever
reason
the
federal
appellees
give
or
the
federal
agency
gives
is
final,
conclusive,
and
can
never
be
reviewed.
for
instance,
the
federal
agency
may
say
you
were
late
yesterday.
in
appellant
christian’s
case
the
facts
were
very
similar
to
that,
where
"you
were
absent
yesterday
and
you
did
not
call
in."
appellant
christian
said,
“my
older
daughter
did
call
in
and
she
advised
me
that
she
did
so
and
i
had
her
do
so."
"the
telephone
in
my
apartment
does
not
work.”
there
were
underlying
facts
as
to
whether
or
not
she
did
call
in,
and
which
is
a
crucial
determination
because
the
state
applies
its
state
law
as
to
whether
as
misconduct
(voice
overlap)
mr.
e.
richard
larson
oh!
certainly
not.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
in
our
due
process
claim
of
course,
we
alleged
that
the
requisites,
the
fundamental
requisites
of
due
process.
the
normal
requisite
elements
of
a
due
process
hearing
should
be
provided.
but,
then
i
think
i
can
illustrate
with
the
plaintiffs
here.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
the
procedure
with
regard
to
the
state
procedure.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
i
should
note
here
that
the
state
procedure,
as
well
as
the
federal
procedure
with
regard
to
terminating
a
federal
employees.
the
elements
of
the
hearings
are
basically
the
due
process
elements.
there
is
an
impartial
hearing
examiner.
there
is
a
requirement
that
decision
must
be
based
upon
the
evidence
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
this
is
also
present
at
the
unemployment
stage.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
yes.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
i
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
in
the
state
situation,
the
hearing
examiner
would
base
its
determination
upon
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
it
depends
upon
the
facts
before
him.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that’s
what
would
he
decide.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
decide
the
facts
before
him.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
at
that
stage,
yes.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
right.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
fair
hearing
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that
is
correct.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
it’s
a
more
elaborative
procedure,
where
there
is
an
opportunity
for
cross
examination
and
confrontation
of
witnesses,
their
seeking
the
power.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that’s
final
and
conclusive,
nothing
more.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
at
both
stages.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
section
8501,
which
provides
the
basic
coverage
of
the
law,
specifically
accepts
from
coverage
certain
federal
employees.
it
does
accept
that
type
of
federal
employee.
it
was
on
the
contract
or
fee
basis.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
so,
that
person
would
not
be
covered.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
i’m
not
sure
i
understand
your
question
mr.
chief
justice.
if
he
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
well,
the
unemployment
compensation
is
not
available
to
the
latter
employee.
if
it
were
available
to
the
latter
employee,
who
were
on
a
contract
basis,
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
a
resignation.
basically,
a
resignation
situation
or
it
maybe
interpreted
as
a
lay-off.
but
if
it
is
lay-off,
then
the
person
would
be
eligible.
but,
this
is
a
factor,
which
under
state
law
or
with
regard
to
all
state
employees,
private
employees,
federal
permanent
employees
is
fairly
decided,
if
there
are
factual
issues.
it
is
fairly
decided
for
those
employees,
but
if
it’s
a
federal
probationary
employee,
it
is
not
fairly
decided
with
federal
reasons
are
automatically
accepted
as
binding
and
conclusive.
with
regard
to
the
due
process
argument,
most
of
the
due
process
cases,
which
come
before
this
court
of
course,
concern
the
finer
issues
of
due
process,
with
regard
to
the
timing
of
the
hearing
or
the
form
of
the
specific
elements
of
the
hearing.
here,
of
course
the
issue
is
much
more
basic,
since
there
is
no
hearing
at
anytime,
yet
this
contractual
right
is
taken
away
from
the
appellants.
here
there
is
no
impartial
decision
maker,
there
is
no
decision
to
be
based
upon
the
evidence,
there
is
no
oral
presentation
of
evidence,
no
oral
argument,
no
right
to
representation,
no
confrontation
or
cross
examination,
none
of
these
elements
are
here.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
no,
i
think
should
i
point
out
that
tori
of
course,
as
in
the
bernie
case
the
prior
hearing
cases
which
were
at
issue
here,
already
provided
the
precise
procedures,
which
we
are
seeking
here.
the
issue
in
tori
and
bernie
was
a
prior
hearing.
what
was
required
prior
to
the
termination
of
benefits,
but
as
required
by
statute,
as
mr.
chief
justice
asked,
the
procedure
that
we're
seeking
here
was
required
to
be
provided
in
tori’s
and
in
bernie’s
the
initial
fair
and
initial
termination,
and
the
fair
hearing
procedure
later.
that
was
not
an
issue
in
bernie
or
tori’s
that
was
already
statutorily
provided.
this
is
not
a
prior
hearing
case,
this
is
just
a
hearing,
there
is
no
hearing,
no
fairness
in
this
procedure
at
all,
as
the
apellees
state
at
page
17
of
their
brief,
all
they
find,
all
they
determined,
they
state
that
it’s
merely
a
statement
of
the
agency’s
reasons
for
discharging
the
employee
that’s
all
there
is.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
at
all.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that’s
provided
for
in
the
statutes
and
we
do
not
challenge
that
statutory
scheme
of
having
an
initial
determination
procedure,
which
is
not
a
full
blown
hearing.
we
do
not
challenge
the
absence
of
full
blown
hearing
procedures
of
the
initial
stage,
because
there
is
a
later
statutory
hearing.
here,
there
is
never
any
statutory
hearing,
nor
is
there
even
a
fair
initial
determination
process.
i
think
this
can
be
the
lack
of
one
of
the
essential
elements
of
a
due
process
here
in
confrontation
and
cross
examination
is
particularly
well
illustrated
by
appellant
green’s
case.
appellant
green
was
discharged
by
his
employer,
the
treasury
department,
as
noted
on
page
52
of
the
appendix,
“as
you
were
observed”
engaging
in
such,
and
such
alleged
misconduct.
now,
appellant
green
never
new
with
this
observer
was.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
yes,
now
it
is
alleged
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
he
was
observed
to
have
been
drinking
and
the
observation
is
a
matter
of
fact
occurred
more
or
alleged
to
have
occurred
more
than
3
½
months
prior
to
his
termination.
in
other
words,
if--well,
he
was
not
terminated
immediately
after
this
alleged
event
took
place,
rather
they
waited.
it
was
six
days
before
the
end
of
his
probationary
period
at
which
he
was
terminated
for
this
alleged
observation,
which
took
place
3
½
months
before.
now,
of
course,
appellant
green
was
allowed
no
opportunity
for
confrontation
or
cross
examination
of
this
unknown
observer,
this
element
was
completely
absent
as
are
the
other
elements
of
a
fair
hearing.
there’s
no
procedure,
there’s
no
requirement
for
a
fair
hearing
examine
or
fair
decision
maker,
instead
the
decision
maker
here
is
conceded
to
be
the
agency,
a
bias
party.
indeed,
there
is
no
requirement
that
the
decision
be
based
upon
the
evidence.
instead
all
that
we
have
is
the
ex
parte’s
statement
of
the
reasons
by
the
federal
agency.
this
procedure
we
submit
is
a
one
sided
determination
of
facts,
the
size
of
contractual
right.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
the
statutory
argument
is
based
on,
i
guess
many
different
factors,
but
the
outset
we
would
look
at
the
powell
decision
in
the
smith
case.
and
what
they
did
of
course
is
they
looked
at
unemployment
compensation
generally.
the
right
to
a
fair
hearing
that
this
is
a
very
important
right
in
the
unemployment
compensation
statutory
scheme,
and
that
this
fair
hearing
cannot
be
lightly
taken
away.
now
of
course,
the
appellees
in
this
case
do
not
contend
that
their
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
necessarily
the
only
interpretation
of
the
statute.
all
they
contend
is
that
the
secretary
has
grabbed
the
authority
to
make
whatever
fact-finding
procedure
it
chooses
to
make.
and,
it
here
chose
not
to
provide
for
fairness
or
for
hearing
procedures.
we
contend
it,
as
long
as
they
concede
that
their
construction
is
not
one
that
they
contend
the
statutorily
required.
indeed,
the
contrary
interpretation
is
required
that
a
fair
hearing
must
be
provided
here.
also,
what
is
significant
we
hinge
on
the
word
“finding,”
the
congress
used
the
word
“findings,”
they
did
not
use
another
word.
this
is
a
contextual
word
and
in
the
context
of
unemployment
compensation,
the
word
“findings”
is
very
fairly
mean,
can
mean
findings
after
a
hearing.
additionally,
we
looked
very
strongly
to
the
dominant
legislative
theme
of
providing
unemployment
compensation
to
federal
employees,
that
dominant
scheme
is
simply
to
make
employees
equal
to
stay
in
private
employees.
provide
them
with
the
same
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
as
provided
to
other
employees.
so,
i
should
note
that
this
court
need
not
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional,
that
the
proper
statutory
construction
here
does
require
--
that
a
hearing
be
provided
to
the
appellants.
i
should
also
note
that
this
court
of
course
has
reviewed
many
cases
of
statutory
construction,
which
it
involved
questions
of
due
process,
where
the
due
process
considered
an
issue.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
that
is
one
of
the
statutes
which
we
rely
on
very
definitely.
that
is
the
most
clear
statement
made
by
the
congress
with
regard
to
the
provision
of
fair
hearing,
but
there
are
a
host
of
other
avenues
which
lead
to
the
same
conclusion
that
a
hearing
must
be
provided.
i
noticed
my
time
has
expired,
i
would
like
to
save
whatever
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
i
do
not
think
there
is
mr.
justice
blackmun
i
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
yes,
the
district
court
did.
i
think
the
district
court
of
course
is
clearly
wrong
and
1908
decision
by
this
court
on
mandamus,
under
1361
jurisdiction
makes
clear
that
common
law
or
the
relief
available
to
common
law
mandamus
includes
corrective
orders
against
federal
officials
who
have
violated
the
constitution.
and
what
the
district
court
did
was
it
held
that
--
it
determined
there
was
no
mandamus
jurisdiction
over
the
federal
defendants
and
consequently
did
not
reach
the
constitutional
issues
as
to
federal
defendants,
but
i
would
submit
that
garfield,
a
decision
more
than
60
years
old
reached
by
this
court,
makes
clear
that
the
mandamus
remedy
extends
to
the
corrective
orders
against
unconstitutional
activity.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
i
submit
they
did
in
this
case
your
honor.
i
should
also
note
that
the
federal
district
court
dismissed
the
lack
of
jurisdiction
under
1343
(3).
now,
we
contend
through
a
joint
participation
theory
of
this
federal
state
program
that
the
federal
government
is
in
joint
participation
with
the
state
appellees
and
accordingly
are
properly
named
as
defendants
under
1343
(3).
mr.
e.
richard
larson
we
did
not
alleged
that
in
our
complaint.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
well,
that‘s
of
course
the
position
they
have
taken
in
argument
with
us,
but
you
must
remember
that
they
of
course
denied
a
fair
hearing
to
appellants
christian
and
green
in
this
case.
if
they
have
not
been
--
their
cooperation,
their
agreement
with
the
federal
defendants
or
federal
appellees
in
this
action,
a
joint
participation
which
is
clear
through
the
statute
both
section
8502
and
8504
made
clear
that
the
federal
government
assigns
all
wages,
all
claims,
to
the
state
and
that
the
state
is
to
operate
the
program.
i
think
also
a
quote
from
shapiro
v.
thompson
is
appropriate
where
the
court
stated
that
congress
is
without
power
to
compel
state
cooperation
in
a
program,
in
a
joint
federal
state
program,
which
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
this
is
a
joint
federal
state
program
and
the
unquestioned
by
this
pursuant
to
federal
law.
but,
it
is
the
state
actually,
which
has
denied
the
fair
hearing
act.
i
notice
my
time
is
up.
mr.
e.
richard
larson
if
i
may
make
one
comment
about
this
last
one?
mr.
e.
richard
larson
we
did
note
--
mr.
e.
richard
larson
as
pointed
out
by
mr.
evans
on
page
9,
note
6
of
our
reply
brief,
this
court
held
last
term
that
were
the
adequacy
of
the
administrative
procedure
is
the
issued
to
resolve,
exhaustion
is
not
required.
thank
you.
