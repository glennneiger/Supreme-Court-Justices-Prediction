justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
our
affirmance
in
tori
as
i
take
it
approved
is
the
absence
of
some
of
those
procedures
for
a
termination
of
unemployment
compensation,
would
you
apply
a
different
standard
to
the
initial
eligibility
determination?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
a
bit
of
a
more
fire
reaching
type
of
hearing
is
required
in
making
an
initial
determination
that
you're
entitled
to
a
right,
than
in
making
a
later
determination
that
takes
it
away
from
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
why
is
there
that
distinction
that
you
suggest
between
a
hearing
and
determining
initial
eligibility
and
a
hearing
terminating
the
right.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
you
get
joint
participation
here
between
the
state
and
federal
employees?
my
impression
of
the
state’s
position
was
that
they’re
perfectly
willing
to
give
you
whatever
the
federal
government
provides
by
statute.
they’re
willing
to
give
you
the
benefit
of
their
full
hearing,
if
they’re
not
precluded
by
the
federal
statute.
they
really
have
no
dispute
with
you
at
all.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
book
are
referring
to
mr.
evans?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
evans
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--
the
plaintiffs
brought
this
action,
didn’t
they?
they
were
(voice
overlap)
--
did
they
alleged
in
their
complaint
that
they
exhausted
their
(voice
overlap)?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
exhaustion
is
a
matter
of
defense,
i
suppose
justice
marshall
is
quite
right
that
some
of
the
government
should’ve
raised
by
way
of
an
answer
to
the
complaint.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it’s
a
prerequisite
of
being
able
to
proceed
with
an
adjudication,
then
i
suppose
the
plaintiff
has
to
alleged.
did
you
have
any
citations
as
to
whether
which
side
the
line
it’s
on.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
that’s
kind
of
tough
to
ask
opposing
counsel
to
concede
something
that’s
outside
the
record.
