justice
thurgood

well,
how
could
we
assume
that
it
wasn’t
done?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
think
before
i
could
say
somebody
was
guilty
of
exhausted
their
remedies,
i
don’t
know
whether
they
did
or
didn’t.
justice

not
being
unreasonable
in
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
fact
you
are
conceding
right
now.
the
records
didn’t
say
it
positively

justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
you
present
factual
point
to
this
court,
i
don’t
think
this
court
can
decide
a
factual
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
in
there
that
said
they
did
or
did
not?
that
is
my
only
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
if
you’d
raise
that
point,
at
that
time
they
might
have.
(voice

now
to
raise
it,
where
there’s
no
way
for
them
to
answer
it.
justice
thurgood

does
my
question
come
down
that
the
facts
that
are
needed
for
these
should
have
been
presented
in
the
lower
court
and
since,
you
are
raising
them,
why
didn’t
you
raise
it
then,
instead
of
raising
it
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
didn’t
you
raise
it
below?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
you’re
responsible
for
it.
