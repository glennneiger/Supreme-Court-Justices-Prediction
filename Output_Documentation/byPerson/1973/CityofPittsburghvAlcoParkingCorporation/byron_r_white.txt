justice
byron
r.
white
are
we
talking
about
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
question,
is
the
federal
constitution
in
that
city
from
forbidding
private
parking
lots
within
the
city
limits?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
assisted
say,
if
pennsylvania
constitution
or
statutes
prohibit
themselves
permitted
pittsburgh
to
do
this,
to
prevent
entire
private
parking
lots,
you
would
think
the
federal
constitution
was
committed?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
at
all
as
to
whether
this
tax
could
be
passed
on
or
was
being
passed
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
we
will
get
to
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
it
work
can
passed
on
and
they’re
appointing
(voice
overlap)
finding
in
any
company
without
business
or
was
forced
out
of
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
--
was
the
parking
authority
subject
to
the
same
tax
or
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
your
position
that
the
city
violates
the
constitution
when
it
simply
imposes
the
gross
receipts
tax
that
has
the
result
of
reducing
the
number
of
customers
for
parking
lot
spaces?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
many
public
parking
spaces
were
there
that's
run
by
the
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
many
total
in
the
city?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
it
means
that
the
tax
would
probably
might
guarantee
as
the
price
got
higher
and
higher
that
the
spaces
in
the
authority
and
lots
would
always
be
full?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
it
cannot
get
any
worst
in
5
or
6,000
places,
full
places
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
can
reduce
the
number
of
cars
that
come
into
park?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
has
not
happened
though?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
that
isn't
what
--
i
would
suppose
that
it
is
the
reduction
of
the
number
of
people
who
want
parking
spaces
that
would
get
to
you
pretty
fast.
do
you
have
any
statistics
in
the
record
as
to
how
many
parkers
there
were
over
the
years
as
this
tax
got
higher
and
higher?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
any
statistics
in
the
record
as
to
what
the
average
vacancy
was
in
the
authority’s
parking
lots?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
they
always
full?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
their
spaces
were
going
begging
too
to
some
extent?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think,
i
suppose
you
would
think
it
would
a
taking
also
of
city
of
pittsburgh
if
it
didn't
operate
any
parking
lots
of
is
own,
simply
imposed
a
minimum
schedule
of
parking
fees
in
order
to
limit
the
entry
of
cars
into
the
downtown
area
and
they
put
the
minimum
price
that
are
high
enough
so
that
people
wouldn't
pay
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
long
as
the
tax
in
this
case
at
first
at
least
was
on,
until
you
managed
to
get
it
invalidated,
was
on
the
city
activity
and
on
the
private
activity
also?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
wait
a
minute,
wait
a
minute
and
i
am
sure
before
the
tax
went
on,
the
rates
were
disparate
also
because
you
say
that
the
parking
authority
has
an
advantage?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
they
put
a
level
tax
on,
the
two
remain
disparate
but
they
are
both
are
suffering
the
burden
to
that
extent.
they
are
both
paying
the
tax.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
was
too
before
the
tax
went
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
would
you
say
that
the
government
resource
is
enhanced
if
they
tax
both
the
city
and
the
private?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
lynch,
what
was
the
citation
to
that
mr.
sax’s
more
recent
article?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
pittsburgh
case
comes
here
from
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
that
court
invalidated
a
taxing
ordinance
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh.
the
ordinance
placed
a
special
tax
on
off-street
parking
transactions.
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
held
that
the
tax
was
unduly
high
and
that
when
combined
with
some
other
stiff
competition
from
the
city
zone
parking
lots,
the
tax
wasn’t
equivalent
to
an
uncompensated
confiscation
of
the
property
contrary
to
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
under
our
prior
cases,
we
do
not
think
the
city
of
pittsburgh
exceeded
its
powers
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.

has
filed
a

in

it
cannot
get
any

in
5

justice

but
it
can
