mr.
lynch,
that
is
a
factual
question,
isn't
it
on
which
the
commonwealth
court
found
a
particular
way
and
certainly,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
did
not
upset
that
finding.
how
free
are
we
to
make
our
own
factual
inquiry
into
something
like
that?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
strictly
historical
fact?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
agree
with
you
on
that,
but
then
the
very
next,
in
a
parenthetical
expression
right
after
they
say
that
in
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
they
say
although
it
is
previously
noted,
the
commonwealth
court
found
this
was
not
possible.
so
at
least,
you
have
an
opinion
by
the
pennsylvania
appellate
court
that
the
tax
could
not
be
passed
on
and
are
we
free
to
upset
that?
justice
william

does
the

the
people
who
work
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
10%

tax
on?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
$10.00.
