mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioners,
the
city
of
pittsburgh.
the
respondents
are
private
persons
operating
offstreet
parking
facilities
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh.
on
february
20,
1970,
the
respondent’s
filed
a
suit
to
enjoin
enforcement
of
the
city
of
pittsburgh
parking
tax
ordnance
and
that
ordinance
imposed
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
offstreet
parking
transactions
for
a
consideration
and
established
the
rate
at
20%
of
the
gross
receipts
derived.
that
ordinance
replaced
a
1969
ordinance,
taxing
the
same
privileges
at
the
rate
of
15%
and
that
ordinance
had
in
turn
replaced
a
1963
ordinance,
taxing
the
same
transactions
at
the
rate
of
10%.
the
respondents
are
12
in
number
and
they
operate
17,000
offstreet
parking
spaces
in
the
downtown
area
of
the
city.
there
are
another
1,000
spaces
operated
by
private
persons
not
party
to
this
suit
and
there
are
an
additional
6,100
spaces
operated
by
the
public
parking
authority
of
the
city
of
pittsburgh,
a
public
municipal
corporation.
the
respondents’
allege
basically
that
the
competition
of
the
public
parking
authority
when
combined
with
the
20%
gross
receipts
tax
of
the
city
of
pittsburgh
serves
to
confiscate
their
profits
without
due
process
of
law.
the
issues
raised
then
are
two.
number
one,
whether
or
not
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
places
any
limit
on
the
right
of
a
legislative
body
to
set
the
rate
of
a
revenue
tax.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
the
city
of
pittsburgh
does
not
have
health
powers,
so
from
the
standpoint
of
health
in
terms
of
fumes
or
things
in
that
nature,
no.
from
the
standpoint
of
regulating
traffic
under
its
general
police
powers,
the
city
of
pittsburgh
does
control
parking
operations
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
the
city
of
pittsburgh;
i
do
not
think
in
the
exercise
of
its
police
powers.
well,
it
could
in
turns
of
an
emergency
i
suppose
declare
that
for
example
that
if
there
were
excessive
pollution
in
the
city
on
a
particular
day,
it
might
have
to
cooperate
with
the
county
because
it
does
not
have
directly
the
health
power,
that’s
a
county
function.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
the
city
of
pittsburgh
can
control
parking
by
proper
exercise
of
the
--
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
yes,
sections,
certain
sections,
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think
that
the
city
of
pittsburgh
has
on
its
face
any
specific
power
to
totally
prohibit
parking
in
the
pittsburgh,
in
the
city
unless
it
would
--
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
no,
the
city
of
pittsburgh
--
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think
the
federal
constitution
would.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think
it
would.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
the
city
of
pittsburgh
operates
a
small
number
of
lots,
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
i
think,
there
might
be
a
problem
there
your
honor,
but
that
is
not
the
issue
here.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
there
was
any
intent
of
the
city
of
pittsburgh
to
put
the
private
operators
out
of
business
or
whether
or
not
the
city
of
pittsburgh
was
merely
exercising
its
power
to
raise
revenue
by
imposing
the
tax.
now,
there
has
never
been
any
question
in
this
case
as
to
the
power
of
the
city
of
pittsburgh
to
impose
a
tax
on
parking
transactions
for
the
purposes
of
raising
revenue,
and
the
city
of
pittsburgh
ordinance
states
on
its
face
that
it
was
to
raise
revenue.
the
record
shows
very
clearly
that
revenue
was
raised.
it
shows
very
clearly
that
each
time
the
tax
was
increased,
additional
revenue
was
raised.
so,
the
issue
here
is
not
whether
or
not
the
city
of
pittsburgh
had
power
to
force
the
private
operators
out
of
business
while
the
public
operation
remained.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
under
the
due
process
clause
that
the
revenue
measure
on
its
face
designed
to
raise
revenue
could
be
inquired
into
by
the
court
simply
because
it
was
unreasonable,
simply
because
it
might
believe
to
be
--
you
might
believe
it
to
be
excessive
or
even
destructive
of
a
particular
business.
this
court
has
held
on
numerous
occasions
that
if
the
power
to
tax
exists,
the
extent
of
the
burden
is
strictly
a
concern
of
the
legislature
no
matter
what
the
indirect
effect
of
that
tax.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
no.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
no.
a
second
issue
in
this
case
--
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
when
the
rate
was
set
for
the
first
time
at
10%
in
1962
effective
for
the
year
of
1963,
the
revenue
measure
was
challenged.
that
is
the
10%
rate
and
in
1964
in
a
per
curiam
decision,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
validated
the
10%
tax.
at
that
time,
the
opinion
shows
that
there
were
5,100
parking
authority
spaces,
the
public
spaces
in
existence
at
the
time
of
that
suit
as
compared
to
the
6,100
in
existence
now.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
that
raises
one
of
the
second
basic
issue
in
the
case
--
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
--
your
honor
and
that
is
the
issue
assuming
that
judicial
inquiry
is
proper,
do
the
facts
show
that
property
was
taken
without
due
process
of
law.
now,
the
chance
preceding
inequity,
he
validated
the
ordinance
and
the
tax
and
he
found
among
other
things
that
demand
for
parking
exceeded
supply.
and
to
that
when
the
tax
have
been
increased
in
1969
that
gross
receipts
had
increased
during
the
same
year
after
payment
of
the
tax
and
that
there
had
no
effort
to
pass
the
tax
on.
the
supreme
court
when
it
reversed
the
commonwealth
court
and
as
well
as
the
transfer
in
equity
determined
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
respondents
did
not
have
to
attempt
to
pass
tax
--
the
tax
on
and
in
fact
at
the
time
of
trial,
there
had
been
no
attempt
to
pass
the
tax
on.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
there
is
on
the
average
in
many
cases,
the
rates
being
charged
in
the
publicly
own
garages
are
lower
than
the
rates
being
charged
in
the
private
garages.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
well,
there
is
a
whole
range
of
rates
from
whether
it
is
for
a
half
hour
to
an
hour
to
all
day,
so
that
we
can
say
in
generally
they
are
lower.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that.
however,
i
think
that
if
there
is
a
disparity
and
rates
are
changed
percentage
wise,
then
the
disparity
might
increase.
however,
one
of
the
fundamental
errors
that
we
believe
that
the
majority
below
made
was
to
conclude
that
under
the
circumstances
here,
the
tax
could
not
be
passed
on.
this
is
one
of
the
fundamental
issues
in
this
case
because
the
record
shows,
the
undisputed
facts
are
that
demand
exceeds
supply
by
4,000
spaces.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
but
we
have
an
issue
here
your
honor
which
deals
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
and
you
are
free
to
examine
the
facts
yourselves
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
yes,
because
the
--
i
do
not
think
it
is
fact.
the
finding
that
you
did
not
have
to
make,
that
the
respondents
did
not
have
to
make
an
attempt
to
pass
the
tax
on
in
the
form
of
price
increases
is
really
not
a
finding
of
fact,
it
is
a
conclusion
which
goes
against
the
facts
of
records.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
yes,
i
think
you
are
your
honor
because
that
goes
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance,
which
is
being
tested
as
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
this
court
has
permitted
that
in
prior
cases.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
the
record
does
not
indicate
that
one
company
has
gone
out
of
business.
the
record
indicates
that
the
time
of
trial,
all
the
respondents
had
paid
their
tax.
there
was
a
statistical
compilation
of
income
versus
expenses
and
that
compilation
shows
that
nine
of
14
of
the
operators
--
or
the
projected
expenses
for
the
year
1970
where
in
compared
to
projected
income
that
nine
of
14
operations
studied
would
show
a
loss,
but
that
does
not
in
anyway
show
confiscation.
that
just
is
taking
one
standard.
there
is
not
study
as
to
the
amount
of
salaries
that
were
involved
in
the
operating
expenses
as
to
whether
or
not
they
could
be
consider
return
on
investment.
but
i
want
to
return
your
honor
to
the
question,
the
conclusion
that
you
could
not
pass
the
tax
on.
the
factual
situation
shows
that
25%
of
the
supply
is
controlled
by
the
public
body;
charging
lower
prices.
the
record
also
shows
that
the
public,
the
so
called
public
competitors
charging
lower
prices
is
full
at
all
times.
it
is
completely
full
at
all
times.
with
the
demand
exceeding
supply
by
4,000
spaces,
that
is
another
fact
of
record
and
as
justice
pomeroy
points
out
on
his
dissent,
i
do
not
know
how
you
can
say
it
better.
an
entrepreneur
who
controls
71%
of
the
supply
in
a
market
of
unsatisfied
demand
need
not
concern
himself
with
the
low
cost
competitor.
the
parking
authority
who
controls
29%
of
the
supply
has
no
excess
capacity
and
cannot
serve
his
demand
which
the
71%
competitor
might
drive
away
through
price
increases.
now,
with
all
due
respect
to
justice
roberts
and
the
majority
opinion,
i
think
that
when
demand
exceeds
supply
and
the
low
cost
competitor
is
at
capacity
to
conclude
that
you
do
not
have
to
attempt
to
pass
on
the
tax
in
a
form
of
a
price
increase
is
just
sheer
economic
nonsense.
i
think
at
the
very
least
and
as
justice
pomeroy
also
pointed
out
in
his
dissent.
at
the
time,
he
wrote
his
dissent,
the
respondents
had
indeed
raised
their
prices
and
he
stated
at
the
very
least
you
could
go
back
and
look
at
the
effect
of
that.
you
are
talking
about
confiscation
of
property
and
to
establish
confiscation,
the
fact
should
show,
there
should
be
no
doubt
in
anybody's
mind
that
confiscation
took
place.
no
doubt
in
anybody’s
mind
and
i
had
submit
that
it
is
impossible
not
to
have
a
doubt
in
these
facts.
i
think
another
question
in
this
case
is
the
extent
to
which
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
the
majority
opinion
attempts
to
set
forth
competition,
the
direct
competitions
of
a
governmental
body
as
something
unique
in
this
area
of
the
law.
the
question
of
competition
by
governmental
body
and
taxation
at
high
rates
was
before
this
court
over
a
century
ago
in
the
vc
bank
note
case.
and
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
a
10%
tax
on
bank
notes
admittedly
excessive
for
the
purpose
of
driving
out
a
state
bank
notes
which
were
in
competition
with
the
federal
notes
being
issued
by
the
federal
government
was
profit.
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
permit
judicial
inquiry
into
the
rate
of
the
tax
designed
to
raise
revenue.
that
was
a
matter
for
the
legislature.
again,
more
recently
in
puget
sound
case
cited
in
our
brief,
there,
the
issue
was
a
3%
gross
receipts
tax
imposed
by
the
city
of
seattle.
the
tax
was
imposed
upon
a
like
company
within
--
with
which
the
city
was
in
direct
competition.
this
court
held
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
immunize
a
private
person
from
competition
by
the
government
even
though
the
government
is
also
levying
a
tax
on
the
competitor.
now,
if
the
power
to
compete
exists
and
the
power
to
tax
at
a
rate
exists,
i
do
not
see
how
two
rights
can
make
the
wrong.
we
eventually
get
right
back
to
a
question
of
what
rate
of
tax
is
reasonable
or
burdensome
and
that
issue
is
for
the
legislative
body.
the
majority
opinion
also
places
some
weight
on
a
descent
in
the
magnano
versus
hamilton
case.
and
that
dissent
states
that
it
would
be
conceivable
that
a
revenue
measure
on
its
face
was
only
a
mere
disguise
that
it
was
so
arbitrary
that
it
was
obvious
that
the
intent
was
not
to
raise
revenue,
but
that
the
attempt
was
to
exert
another
power,
perhaps
a
forbidden
power
such
as
confiscation.
well
obviously,
you
couldn't
determine
that
question
on
rate
because
in
the
magnano
case
it
was
admitted
that
the
rate
of
tax
15
cents
a
pound
on
olio
was
going
to
drive
the
olio
companies
out
of
business.
so,
you
can
not
look
to
rate
to
determine
whether
that
is
the
unusual
circumstance
involved.
and
this
revenue
measure
--
it
is
impossible
to
conclude
that
the
measure
is
a
disguise
the
attempt
of
the
city
of
pittsburgh
to
confiscate
the
property
of
the
respondents.
the
measure
on
its
face
says
it
is
raising
revenue.
it
did
raise
revenue.
so,
if
the
court
is
going
to
engage
in
speculation
as
to
what
the
intent
was,
if
it
does
not
accept
the
measure
on
its
face,
there
is
no
reason
to
conclude
that
confiscation
was
the
intent.
i
think
it
would
be
more
reasonable
to
include
that
the
city
of
pittsburgh
had
successfully
raised
revenue
before
by
imposing
a
parking
tax.
that
it
was
reasonable
for
the
city
to
assume
that
when
it
increased
the
tax,
revenue
would
increase.
it
would
also
be
reasonable
to
assume
that
since
it
is
a
parking
tax
and
i
think
that
we
can
all
agree
that
parking
in
the
downtown
metropolitan
area
is
somewhat
of
a
luxury,
that
it
would
not
a
be
unreasonable
to
believe
that
if
the
price
was
raised
in
some
of
the
areas
involving
these
entire
24,000
spaces
in
downtown
pittsburgh,
that
some
of
this
people
coming
in
from
the
suburbs
might
continue
to
come
in
and
pay
an
additional
tax.
i
think
that
would
be
the
fair
conclusion
from
an
examination
of
this
record
and
the
unfair
conclusion
would
be
to
conclude
that
the
city
of
pittsburgh
didn't
intend
to
raise
revenue
at
all.
it
intended
to
confiscate
the
respondents'
business.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
1%
--
it
has
a
10%
occupation
tax
on
non-residents
and
a
1%
tax
on
residents.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
excuse
me,
$10.00.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
$10.00
occupation
tax.
that
is
for
the
privilege
of
working
there.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
respondents
in
this
case,
the
very
people
who
claim
that
the
city
of
pittsburgh
is
out
to
confiscate
their
property
and
to
favor
the
authority
--
and
to
favor
competition
by
the
authority
have
instituted
litigation
successfully
to
eliminate
the
20%
tax
which
is
being
imposed
by
the
city
or
was
being
imposed
by
the
city
on
the
authority
since
the
inception
of
the
tax
in
1963.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
just
another
pocket
of
the
city.
and
even
if
it
were,
i
submit
that
the
way
to
attack
that
problem,
if
the
city
of
pittsburgh
is
using
the
authority
to
compete
unfairly
or
if
the
authority
is
competing
unfairly,
then
appropriate
proceedings
could
be
brought
in
the
state
court.
there
would
no
be
--
there
need
be
no
reason
to
attack
the
tax,
which
is
being
placed
directly
on
the
authority
and
would
tend
to
equalize
the
burden
rather
than
to
further
discriminate.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
right.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
that
litigation
was
commenced
about
a
year-and-a-half
ago
and
the
commonwealth
--
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
20%
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
the
authority
was
paying
20%
and
operators
operating
on
behalf
on
the
authority
were
paying
20%.
those
operators
claimed
the
statutory
exemption
from
taxes
set
forth
in
the
authority's
act
against
the
will
of
the
authority.
they
overcame
preliminary
objections
filed
by
the
authority,
so
you
using
that
exemption,
these
very
respondents
have
been
successful
and
having
the
20%
tax
eliminated
from
the
operations
of
the
public
--
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
the
20%
tax
in
this
case
if
we
prevail?
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
there
is
a
petition
for
certiorari
pending
in
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
this
court
reviewing
the
facts,
you
stated
in
fiske
versus
kansas
city,
this
court
will
review
the
finding
of
fact
by
state
court
where
a
conclusion
of
law
as
to
a
federal
right
and
a
finding
of
fact
are
so
intermingled
as
to
make
it
necessary
in
order
to
pass
upon
the
federal
question
to
analyze
the
facts.
furthermore,
it
is
really
incorrect
to
state
that
the
majority
of
the
state
court
found
that
the
tax
could
not
be
passed
on
in
the
form
of
a
price
increase
because
the
four
three
decision,
justice
egan
concurred
in
the
result
only.
so
i
don't
think
you
can
infer
necessarily
that
justice
egan,
excuse
me
justice
o’bryan
concurring
in
the
result
also
concurred
in
the
conclusion
that
the
tax
could
not
be
passed
on.
i
think
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
three
of
the
justices
of
the
seven
justices
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
concluded
that
the
tax
could
not
be
passed
on.
references
that
made
to
the
inability
to
persuade
the
authority
to
raise
rates
after
the
tax
was
increased,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
any
approach
was
made
to
the
parking
authority
and
then
a
request
for
rate
relief
was
refused,
nothing
in
this
record
on
that.
with
respect
to
the
confiscation
and
the
growth
of
the
authority
into
the
private
area
at
the
time
of
magellic
in
1964,
that
case
was
a
case
stated.
and
among
the
stipulated
facts
were
that
there
were
in
existence
at
at
time
5,100
authority
spaces.
and
now
in
1970
in
september
at
the
time
of
trial
in
this
case,
there
were
existent
6,100
spaces,
hardly
a
record
of
a
wildly
spawning
authority
operation
at
the
expense
of
private
industry.
reference
is
made
to
professor
sax
and
i
think
it
should
be
clear
from
a
reading
of
the
majority
opinion
that
great
weight
is
placed
upon
the
opinions
of
professor
sax
about
government
acting
in
an
entrepreneurial
capacity
rather
than
as
an
arbitrator.
instead
of
showing
nothing
in
a
later
article,
professor
sax
states
and
i
quote,
“i
am
compelled
however
to
disown
the
view
that
whenever
government
can
be
said
to
be
acquiring
resources
for
its
own
account
compensation
must
be
paid.
i
now
view
the
problem
as
considerably
more
complex.”
so,
we
have
a
decision
where
professor
sax
wrote
originally
that
his
opinions
did
not
square
up
with
the
decisions
of
this
court.
the
court
below
and
the
majority
opinion
adopts
professor
sax’s
theory
even
though
they
do
not
square
up
with
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
now,
professor
sax
disowns
his
theory.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
supply
exceeds
demand,
mr.
mcneal,
a
witness
for
the
respondents
was
asked
what
is
the
shortage?
there
is
a
present
deficiency
of
about
4,100
spaces
in
the
survey
area,
that
is
in
downtown
pittsburgh.
that
is
the
answer.
that
is
in
the
central
business
district
which
will
increase
to
approximately
7,500
spaces
based
on
developments
that
are
currently
under
way.
reference
is
made
to
the
exhibit
in
the
respondent’s
brief
on
page
48a
and
i
think
this
illustrates
the
point
the
petitioner
makes
with
respect
to
the
quality
of
the
evidence
presented
in
the
court
below.
there,
justice
cramer
of
the
commonwealth
court
in
his
dissent
put
in
tabular
form
the
findings
that
the
engineer
had
compiled
to
show
the
income
versus
expenses
of
the
respondents.
and
if
you
look
at
that
exhibit
to
see
how
easy
it
is
to
manipulate
this
type
of
evidence.
the
first
seven
companies
the
record
shows
are
owned
by
one
man
--
one
man
on
seven
companies.
the
first
two
companies
show
losses.
dropping
down
to
the
fifth
company,
it
shows
a
profit
of
16,126
and
then
another
company
shows
a
loss
of
5,384.
so,
if
you
combine
companies
one,
two
and
five
with
company
number
four
--
one,
two
and
six
with
company
number
five,
two
of
the
unprofitable
operations
in
this
study
would
be
eliminated.
and
the
remaining
one
would
still
be
profitable.
so,
evidence
like
this
clearly
are
subject
to
manipulation.

mr.

mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
represent
the
petitioners,
the
city
of
pittsburgh.
the
respondents
are
private
persons
operating
offstreet
parking
facilities
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh.
on
february
20,
1970,
the
respondent’s
filed
a
suit
to
enjoin
enforcement
of
the
city
of
pittsburgh
parking
tax
ordnance
and
that
ordinance
imposed
a
tax
on
the
privilege
of
engaging
in
offstreet
parking
transactions
for
a
consideration
and
established
the
rate
at
20%
of
the
gross
receipts
derived.
that
ordinance
replaced
a
1969
ordinance,
taxing
the
same
privileges
at
the
rate
of
15%
and
that
ordinance
had
in
turn
replaced
a
1963
ordinance,
taxing
the
same
transactions
at
the
rate
of
10%.
the
respondents
are
12
in
number
and
they
operate
17,000
offstreet
parking
spaces
in
the
downtown
area
of
the
city.
there
are
another
1,000
spaces
operated
by
private
persons
not
party
to
this
suit
and
there
are
an
additional
6,100
spaces
operated
by
the
public
parking
authority
of
the
city
of
pittsburgh,
a
public
municipal
corporation.
the
respondents’
allege
basically
that
the
competition
of
the
public
parking
authority
when
combined
with
the
20%
gross
receipts
tax
of
the
city
of
pittsburgh
serves
to
confiscate
their
profits
without
due
process
of
law.
the
issues
raised
then
are
two.
number
one,
whether
or
not
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
places
any
limit
on
the
right
of
a
legislative
body
to
set
the
rate
of
a
revenue
tax.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
the
city
of
pittsburgh
does
not
have
health
powers,
so
from
the
standpoint
of
health
in
terms
of
fumes
or
things
in
that
nature,
no.
from
the
standpoint
of
regulating
traffic
under
its
general
police
powers,
the
city
of
pittsburgh
does
control
parking
operations
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
the
city
of
pittsburgh;
i
do
not
think
in
the
exercise
of
its
police
powers.
well,
it
could
in
turns
of
an
emergency
i
suppose
declare
that
for
example
that
if
there
were
excessive
pollution
in
the
city
on
a
particular
day,
it
might
have
to
cooperate
with
the
county
because
it
does
not
have
directly
the
health
power,
that’s
a
county
function.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
the
city
of
pittsburgh
can
control
parking
by
proper
exercise
of
the
--
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
yes,
sections,
certain
sections,
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think
that
the
city
of
pittsburgh
has
on
its
face
any
specific
power
to
totally
prohibit
parking
in
the
pittsburgh,
in
the
city
unless
it
would
--
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
no,
the
city
of
pittsburgh
--
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think
the
federal
constitution
would.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
think
it
would.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
the
city
of
pittsburgh
operates
a
small
number
of
lots,
yes
sir.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
i
think,
there
might
be
a
problem
there
your
honor,
but
that
is
not
the
issue
here.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
there
was
any
intent
of
the
city
of
pittsburgh
to
put
the
private
operators
out
of
business
or
whether
or
not
the
city
of
pittsburgh
was
merely
exercising
its
power
to
raise
revenue
by
imposing
the
tax.
now,
there
has
never
been
any
question
in
this
case
as
to
the
power
of
the
city
of
pittsburgh
to
impose
a
tax
on
parking
transactions
for
the
purposes
of
raising
revenue,
and
the
city
of
pittsburgh
ordinance
states
on
its
face
that
it
was
to
raise
revenue.
the
record
shows
very
clearly
that
revenue
was
raised.
it
shows
very
clearly
that
each
time
the
tax
was
increased,
additional
revenue
was
raised.
so,
the
issue
here
is
not
whether
or
not
the
city
of
pittsburgh
had
power
to
force
the
private
operators
out
of
business
while
the
public
operation
remained.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
under
the
due
process
clause
that
the
revenue
measure
on
its
face
designed
to
raise
revenue
could
be
inquired
into
by
the
court
simply
because
it
was
unreasonable,
simply
because
it
might
believe
to
be
--
you
might
believe
it
to
be
excessive
or
even
destructive
of
a
particular
business.
this
court
has
held
on
numerous
occasions
that
if
the
power
to
tax
exists,
the
extent
of
the
burden
is
strictly
a
concern
of
the
legislature
no
matter
what
the
indirect
effect
of
that
tax.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
no.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
no.
a
second
issue
in
this
case
--
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
when
the
rate
was
set
for
the
first
time
at
10%
in
1962
effective
for
the
year
of
1963,
the
revenue
measure
was
challenged.
that
is
the
10%
rate
and
in
1964
in
a
per
curiam
decision,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
validated
the
10%
tax.
at
that
time,
the
opinion
shows
that
there
were
5,100
parking
authority
spaces,
the
public
spaces
in
existence
at
the
time
of
that
suit
as
compared
to
the
6,100
in
existence
now.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
that
raises
one
of
the
second
basic
issue
in
the
case
--
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
--
your
honor
and
that
is
the
issue
assuming
that
judicial
inquiry
is
proper,
do
the
facts
show
that
property
was
taken
without
due
process
of
law.
now,
the
chance
preceding
inequity,
he
validated
the
ordinance
and
the
tax
and
he
found
among
other
things
that
demand
for
parking
exceeded
supply.
and
to
that
when
the
tax
have
been
increased
in
1969
that
gross
receipts
had
increased
during
the
same
year
after
payment
of
the
tax
and
that
there
had
no
effort
to
pass
the
tax
on.
the
supreme
court
when
it
reversed
the
commonwealth
court
and
as
well
as
the
transfer
in
equity
determined
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
respondents
did
not
have
to
attempt
to
pass
tax
--
the
tax
on
and
in
fact
at
the
time
of
trial,
there
had
been
no
attempt
to
pass
the
tax
on.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
there
is
on
the
average
in
many
cases,
the
rates
being
charged
in
the
publicly
own
garages
are
lower
than
the
rates
being
charged
in
the
private
garages.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
well,
there
is
a
whole
range
of
rates
from
whether
it
is
for
a
half
hour
to
an
hour
to
all
day,
so
that
we
can
say
in
generally
they
are
lower.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
yes.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that.
however,
i
think
that
if
there
is
a
disparity
and
rates
are
changed
percentage
wise,
then
the
disparity
might
increase.
however,
one
of
the
fundamental
errors
that
we
believe
that
the
majority
below
made
was
to
conclude
that
under
the
circumstances
here,
the
tax
could
not
be
passed
on.
this
is
one
of
the
fundamental
issues
in
this
case
because
the
record
shows,
the
undisputed
facts
are
that
demand
exceeds
supply
by
4,000
spaces.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
but
we
have
an
issue
here
your
honor
which
deals
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
constitution
and
you
are
free
to
examine
the
facts
yourselves
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
constitutional
violation.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
yes,
because
the
--
i
do
not
think
it
is
fact.
the
finding
that
you
did
not
have
to
make,
that
the
respondents
did
not
have
to
make
an
attempt
to
pass
the
tax
on
in
the
form
of
price
increases
is
really
not
a
finding
of
fact,
it
is
a
conclusion
which
goes
against
the
facts
of
records.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
yes,
i
think
you
are
your
honor
because
that
goes
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
ordinance,
which
is
being
tested
as
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
this
court
has
permitted
that
in
prior
cases.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
the
record
does
not
indicate
that
one
company
has
gone
out
of
business.
the
record
indicates
that
the
time
of
trial,
all
the
respondents
had
paid
their
tax.
there
was
a
statistical
compilation
of
income
versus
expenses
and
that
compilation
shows
that
nine
of
14
of
the
operators
--
or
the
projected
expenses
for
the
year
1970
where
in
compared
to
projected
income
that
nine
of
14
operations
studied
would
show
a
loss,
but
that
does
not
in
anyway
show
confiscation.
that
just
is
taking
one
standard.
there
is
not
study
as
to
the
amount
of
salaries
that
were
involved
in
the
operating
expenses
as
to
whether
or
not
they
could
be
consider
return
on
investment.
but
i
want
to
return
your
honor
to
the
question,
the
conclusion
that
you
could
not
pass
the
tax
on.
the
factual
situation
shows
that
25%
of
the
supply
is
controlled
by
the
public
body;
charging
lower
prices.
the
record
also
shows
that
the
public,
the
so
called
public
competitors
charging
lower
prices
is
full
at
all
times.
it
is
completely
full
at
all
times.
with
the
demand
exceeding
supply
by
4,000
spaces,
that
is
another
fact
of
record
and
as
justice
pomeroy
points
out
on
his
dissent,
i
do
not
know
how
you
can
say
it
better.
an
entrepreneur
who
controls
71%
of
the
supply
in
a
market
of
unsatisfied
demand
need
not
concern
himself
with
the
low
cost
competitor.
the
parking
authority
who
controls
29%
of
the
supply
has
no
excess
capacity
and
cannot
serve
his
demand
which
the
71%
competitor
might
drive
away
through
price
increases.
now,
with
all
due
respect
to
justice
roberts
and
the
majority
opinion,
i
think
that
when
demand
exceeds
supply
and
the
low
cost
competitor
is
at
capacity
to
conclude
that
you
do
not
have
to
attempt
to
pass
on
the
tax
in
a
form
of
a
price
increase
is
just
sheer
economic
nonsense.
i
think
at
the
very
least
and
as
justice
pomeroy
also
pointed
out
in
his
dissent.
at
the
time,
he
wrote
his
dissent,
the
respondents
had
indeed
raised
their
prices
and
he
stated
at
the
very
least
you
could
go
back
and
look
at
the
effect
of
that.
you
are
talking
about
confiscation
of
property
and
to
establish
confiscation,
the
fact
should
show,
there
should
be
no
doubt
in
anybody's
mind
that
confiscation
took
place.
no
doubt
in
anybody’s
mind
and
i
had
submit
that
it
is
impossible
not
to
have
a
doubt
in
these
facts.
i
think
another
question
in
this
case
is
the
extent
to
which
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
the
majority
opinion
attempts
to
set
forth
competition,
the
direct
competitions
of
a
governmental
body
as
something
unique
in
this
area
of
the
law.
the
question
of
competition
by
governmental
body
and
taxation
at
high
rates
was
before
this
court
over
a
century
ago
in
the
vc
bank
note
case.
and
in
that
case,
this
court
held
that
a
10%
tax
on
bank
notes
admittedly
excessive
for
the
purpose
of
driving
out
a
state
bank
notes
which
were
in
competition
with
the
federal
notes
being
issued
by
the
federal
government
was
profit.
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
permit
judicial
inquiry
into
the
rate
of
the
tax
designed
to
raise
revenue.
that
was
a
matter
for
the
legislature.
again,
more
recently
in
puget
sound
case
cited
in
our
brief,
there,
the
issue
was
a
3%
gross
receipts
tax
imposed
by
the
city
of
seattle.
the
tax
was
imposed
upon
a
like
company
within
--
with
which
the
city
was
in
direct
competition.
this
court
held
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
immunize
a
private
person
from
competition
by
the
government
even
though
the
government
is
also
levying
a
tax
on
the
competitor.
now,
if
the
power
to
compete
exists
and
the
power
to
tax
at
a
rate
exists,
i
do
not
see
how
two
rights
can
make
the
wrong.
we
eventually
get
right
back
to
a
question
of
what
rate
of
tax
is
reasonable
or
burdensome
and
that
issue
is
for
the
legislative
body.
the
majority
opinion
also
places
some
weight
on
a
descent
in
the
magnano
versus
hamilton
case.
and
that
dissent
states
that
it
would
be
conceivable
that
a
revenue
measure
on
its
face
was
only
a
mere
disguise
that
it
was
so
arbitrary
that
it
was
obvious
that
the
intent
was
not
to
raise
revenue,
but
that
the
attempt
was
to
exert
another
power,
perhaps
a
forbidden
power
such
as
confiscation.
well
obviously,
you
couldn't
determine
that
question
on
rate
because
in
the
magnano
case
it
was
admitted
that
the
rate
of
tax
15
cents
a
pound
on
olio
was
going
to
drive
the
olio
companies
out
of
business.
so,
you
can
not
look
to
rate
to
determine
whether
that
is
the
unusual
circumstance
involved.
and
this
revenue
measure
--
it
is
impossible
to
conclude
that
the
measure
is
a
disguise
the
attempt
of
the
city
of
pittsburgh
to
confiscate
the
property
of
the
respondents.
the
measure
on
its
face
says
it
is
raising
revenue.
it
did
raise
revenue.
so,
if
the
court
is
going
to
engage
in
speculation
as
to
what
the
intent
was,
if
it
does
not
accept
the
measure
on
its
face,
there
is
no
reason
to
conclude
that
confiscation
was
the
intent.
i
think
it
would
be
more
reasonable
to
include
that
the
city
of
pittsburgh
had
successfully
raised
revenue
before
by
imposing
a
parking
tax.
that
it
was
reasonable
for
the
city
to
assume
that
when
it
increased
the
tax,
revenue
would
increase.
it
would
also
be
reasonable
to
assume
that
since
it
is
a
parking
tax
and
i
think
that
we
can
all
agree
that
parking
in
the
downtown
metropolitan
area
is
somewhat
of
a
luxury,
that
it
would
not
a
be
unreasonable
to
believe
that
if
the
price
was
raised
in
some
of
the
areas
involving
these
entire
24,000
spaces
in
downtown
pittsburgh,
that
some
of
this
people
coming
in
from
the
suburbs
might
continue
to
come
in
and
pay
an
additional
tax.
i
think
that
would
be
the
fair
conclusion
from
an
examination
of
this
record
and
the
unfair
conclusion
would
be
to
conclude
that
the
city
of
pittsburgh
didn't
intend
to
raise
revenue
at
all.
it
intended
to
confiscate
the
respondents'
business.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
1%
--
it
has
a
10%
occupation
tax
on
non-residents
and
a
1%
tax
on
residents.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
excuse
me,
$10.00.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
$10.00
occupation
tax.
that
is
for
the
privilege
of
working
there.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
respondents
in
this
case,
the
very
people
who
claim
that
the
city
of
pittsburgh
is
out
to
confiscate
their
property
and
to
favor
the
authority
--
and
to
favor
competition
by
the
authority
have
instituted
litigation
successfully
to
eliminate
the
20%
tax
which
is
being
imposed
by
the
city
or
was
being
imposed
by
the
city
on
the
authority
since
the
inception
of
the
tax
in
1963.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
just
another
pocket
of
the
city.
and
even
if
it
were,
i
submit
that
the
way
to
attack
that
problem,
if
the
city
of
pittsburgh
is
using
the
authority
to
compete
unfairly
or
if
the
authority
is
competing
unfairly,
then
appropriate
proceedings
could
be
brought
in
the
state
court.
there
would
no
be
--
there
need
be
no
reason
to
attack
the
tax,
which
is
being
placed
directly
on
the
authority
and
would
tend
to
equalize
the
burden
rather
than
to
further
discriminate.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
right.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
that
litigation
was
commenced
about
a
year-and-a-half
ago
and
the
commonwealth
--
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
20%
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
the
authority
was
paying
20%
and
operators
operating
on
behalf
on
the
authority
were
paying
20%.
those
operators
claimed
the
statutory
exemption
from
taxes
set
forth
in
the
authority's
act
against
the
will
of
the
authority.
they
overcame
preliminary
objections
filed
by
the
authority,
so
you
using
that
exemption,
these
very
respondents
have
been
successful
and
having
the
20%
tax
eliminated
from
the
operations
of
the
public
--
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
the
20%
tax
in
this
case
if
we
prevail?
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
there
is
a
petition
for
certiorari
pending
in
pennsylvania
supreme
court.
mr.
ralph
lynch,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
this
court
reviewing
the
facts,
you
stated
in
fiske
versus
kansas
city,
this
court
will
review
the
finding
of
fact
by
state
court
where
a
conclusion
of
law
as
to
a
federal
right
and
a
finding
of
fact
are
so
intermingled
as
to
make
it
necessary
in
order
to
pass
upon
the
federal
question
to
analyze
the
facts.
furthermore,
it
is
really
incorrect
to
state
that
the
majority
of
the
state
court
found
that
the
tax
could
not
be
passed
on
in
the
form
of
a
price
increase
because
the
four
three
decision,
justice
egan
concurred
in
the
result
only.
so
i
don't
think
you
can
infer
necessarily
that
justice
egan,
excuse
me
justice
o’bryan
concurring
in
the
result
also
concurred
in
the
conclusion
that
the
tax
could
not
be
passed
on.
i
think
it
is
only
fair
to
say
that
three
of
the
justices
of
the
seven
justices
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
concluded
that
the
tax
could
not
be
passed
on.
references
that
made
to
the
inability
to
persuade
the
authority
to
raise
rates
after
the
tax
was
increased,
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
any
approach
was
made
to
the
parking
authority
and
then
a
request
for
rate
relief
was
refused,
nothing
in
this
record
on
that.
with
respect
to
the
confiscation
and
the
growth
of
the
authority
into
the
private
area
at
the
time
of
magellic
in
1964,
that
case
was
a
case
stated.
and
among
the
stipulated
facts
were
that
there
were
in
existence
at
at
time
5,100
authority
spaces.
and
now
in
1970
in
september
at
the
time
of
trial
in
this
case,
there
were
existent
6,100
spaces,
hardly
a
record
of
a
wildly
spawning
authority
operation
at
the
expense
of
private
industry.
reference
is
made
to
professor
sax
and
i
think
it
should
be
clear
from
a
reading
of
the
majority
opinion
that
great
weight
is
placed
upon
the
opinions
of
professor
sax
about
government
acting
in
an
entrepreneurial
capacity
rather
than
as
an
arbitrator.
instead
of
showing
nothing
in
a
later
article,
professor
sax
states
and
i
quote,
“i
am
compelled
however
to
disown
the
view
that
whenever
government
can
be
said
to
be
acquiring
resources
for
its
own
account
compensation
must
be
paid.
i
now
view
the
problem
as
considerably
more
complex.”
so,
we
have
a
decision
where
professor
sax
wrote
originally
that
his
opinions
did
not
square
up
with
the
decisions
of
this
court.
the
court
below
and
the
majority
opinion
adopts
professor
sax’s
theory
even
though
they
do
not
square
up
with
the
decisions
of
this
court,
and
now,
professor
sax
disowns
his
theory.
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
supply
exceeds
demand,
mr.
mcneal,
a
witness
for
the
respondents
was
asked
what
is
the
shortage?
there
is
a
present
deficiency
of
about
4,100
spaces
in
the
survey
area,
that
is
in
downtown
pittsburgh.
that
is
the
answer.
that
is
in
the
central
business
district
which
will
increase
to
approximately
7,500
spaces
based
on
developments
that
are
currently
under
way.
reference
is
made
to
the
exhibit
in
the
respondent’s
brief
on
page
48a
and
i
think
this
illustrates
the
point
the
petitioner
makes
with
respect
to
the
quality
of
the
evidence
presented
in
the
court
below.
there,
justice
cramer
of
the
commonwealth
court
in
his
dissent
put
in
tabular
form
the
findings
that
the
engineer
had
compiled
to
show
the
income
versus
expenses
of
the
respondents.
and
if
you
look
at
that
exhibit
to
see
how
easy
it
is
to
manipulate
this
type
of
evidence.
the
first
seven
companies
the
record
shows
are
owned
by
one
man
--
one
man
on
seven
companies.
the
first
two
companies
show
losses.
dropping
down
to
the
fifth
company,
it
shows
a
profit
of
16,126
and
then
another
company
shows
a
loss
of
5,384.
so,
if
you
combine
companies
one,
two
and
five
with
company
number
four
--
one,
two
and
six
with
company
number
five,
two
of
the
unprofitable
operations
in
this
study
would
be
eliminated.
and
the
remaining
one
would
still
be
profitable.
so,
evidence
like
this
clearly
are
subject
to
manipulation.
