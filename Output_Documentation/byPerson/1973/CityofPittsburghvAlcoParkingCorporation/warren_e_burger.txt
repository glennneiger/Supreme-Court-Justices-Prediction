mr.

i
have
feeling
that
your
answers
in
that
last
dialog
at
least
confused
me.
let
me
see
if
i
can
straighten
up
my
own
mind.
is
there
anything
in
the
federal
constitution
that
would
bar
the
city
of
pittsburgh
from
declaring
that
it
was
by
law?
that
it
was
going
to
have
a
monopoly
on
all
public
parking
just
as
it
does
over
water
and
electricity
and
number
of
others?
chief
justice

you
gave
an
