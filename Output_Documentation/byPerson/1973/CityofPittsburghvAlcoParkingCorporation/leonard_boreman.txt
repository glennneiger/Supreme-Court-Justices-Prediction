mr.
leonard
boreman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
necessary
at
the
outset
to
pose
the
issue
in
this
case,
which
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
posed.
in
the
opening
paragraph
of
the
opinion
and
that
is
where
a
city
imposes
a
20%
excise
tax
or
parking
tax
and
that
is
combined
with
the
governmental
operation
of
the
exact
identical
business,
does
that
constitute
a
taking
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
rather
i
should
say
under
the
fifth
amendment
made
unlawful
by
the
states
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
that
is
the
issue.
the
issue
was
not
whether
a
tax
standing
by
itself
is
unconstitutional
and
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
city
has
the
power
to
impose
an
excise
tax
on
these
parking
operators
and
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
city
has
the
power
to
compete
with
the
parking
operators
in
conducting
a
parking
business.
of
course,
there
is
no
question
about
any
of
those
issues,
but
the
issue
is,
can
the
city
impose
a
20%
tax
which
the
commonwealth
court
has
declared
by
an
unanimous
vote
of
the
excessive
and
unreasonable
and
which
the
supreme
court
has
said
is
excessive
and
unreasonable
and
when
combined
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
let
me
explain
that
your
honor.
the
supreme
court,
justice
robert
said
and
adverted
to
invalidation
of
the
tax
against
the
parking
authority,
but
he
said
that
did
influence
his
decision.
he
said
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
parking
authority
outside
of
the
parking
tax
has
total
exemption
from
all
property
taxes,
exemption
from
all
income
taxes,
low
cost
financing,
long-term
financing,
the
power
of
eminent
domain
under
its
statute,
that
these
are
such
great
advantages
that
they
alone
enable
the
parking
authority
to
charge
lower
rates
and
that
adding
the
exemption
of
the
parking
tax
makes
it
even
worse.
now,
may
i
explain
this
part?
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
beg
pardon?
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
think
it
would
be,
your
honor,
yes,
if
the
fact
show,
but
we
think
this
record
shows
and
what
i
propose
to
discuss
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
there,
i
think
there
might
be
a
proper
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
let
me
explain
that,
your
honor
because
i
am
counsel
in
the
case
which
invalidated
the
parking
for
these,
some
of
these
same
plaintiffs,
but
there
are
others.
there
are
some
very
large
interests
who
are
not
placed
in
this
case.
this
is
the
way
the
parking
authority
works.
the
parking
authority
was
created
by
the
legislature
of
pennsylvania
by
the
act
of
1947.
it
authorized
municipalities
to
setup
parking
authorities.
the
city
of
pittsburgh
setup
a
parking
authority.
the
parking
authority
went
out
and
with
the
low
cost
financing
and
long-term
financing
and
with
tax
exemption,
issued
bonds
to
build
these
structures.
they
then
proceeded
to
the
lease
these
garages
to
private
operators.
now,
under
the
terms
of
the
lease,
these
private
operators
pay
a
flat
rate.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
your
honor.
the
parking
authority
operates
a
few
small
lots
where
they
have
parking
meters
i
think
by
themselves,
but
most
of
them
are.
now,
these
operators
pay
a
rent
which
is
enough
to
cover
the
amortization
of
the
bonds,
and
then
they
share
the
profit
with
the
parking
authority
50/50.
now,
these
private
operators,
when
i
say
share
their
profit
50/50,
that
is
after
all
expenses,
so
that
the
burden
of
the
expenses
are
on
these
private
operators
even
though
they
are
operating
the
parking
authority
garages.
if
there
is
a
profit,
the
parking
authority
shares
50%
of
the
profit.
consequently,
if
this
tax
remains
valid
against
the
parking
authority,
these
private
operators
must
add
to
their
expenses
the
amount
of
the
parking
tax.
so,
they
went
into
court
and
i
acted
as
their
counsel
and
the
commonwealth
court
has
so
held,
that
i
might
say
it
is
completely
under
pennsylvania
precedent.
it
is
cited
in
justice
roberts’
opinion.
that
they
went
into
court
to
have
it
declared
--
to
have
the
exemption
in
favor
of
the
parking
authority
declared
and
the
commonwealth
so
declared.
the
case
is
now
on
petition
for
a
(voice
overlap)
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
beg
pardon
sir.
mr.
leonard
boreman
the
tax
cannot
be
passed
on
for
a
several
reasons,
your
honor.
number
one,
there
is
testimony
in
this
record
by
a
number
of
these
plaintiffs
who
by
the
way
are
probably
the
most
experienced
parking
operators
in
the
united
states.
one
operator,
the
operator
of
alco
parking
and
the
others,
may
i
just
go
on
with
this,
your
honor
and
i
will
explain
why,
is
the
largest
parking
operator
in
pittsburgh,
has
been
an
operator
for
over
50
years.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
your
honor,
yes
your
honor.
the
other
one
operating
stanwicks
auto
park
is
a
member
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
national
parking
association.
these
are
experts.
they
have
testified
that
in
their
experience
as
parking
operators,
if
they
are
charging
and
getting
as
much
as
they
can
get,
they
say
and
they
testify,
they
charge
the
highest
rate.
they'd
be
a
fools
not
to
get
lower
if
they
could.
now,
with
the
competition
of
the
parking
authority
garages
sitting
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
well,
the
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
it
is
a
misleading
figure
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
boreman
well,
i
am
not
being
an
expert
on
this
subject,
i
cannot
say
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
there
is
no
actual
testimony.
no,
it
is
a
figure
given
by
wilbur
smith
who
did
a
study
for
the
parking
authority.
mr.
leonard
boreman
it
is
in
the
record.
he
came
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
no
your
honor
because
there
is
no
expert
testimony
that
contradicts
and
i
would
not
want
to
contradict
that,
but
i
would
want
to
explain
it
your
honor.
i
say
that
it
is
a
misleading
figure.
if
you
read
that
record
in
which
that
4,000
figure
is
given,
it
just
says,
it
is
an
overall
average
for
the
whole
city
based
on
the
examination
of
traffic,
congestion,
on
needs
and
so
forth.
now
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
your
honor
but
it
is
the
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
well,
i
think
it
needs
--
it
requires
and
deserves
explaining
your
honor.
that
is
4,000
deficiently
is
that
-
mr.
leonard
boreman
good.
at
2
o’clock,
as
the
studies
will
show
and
it
is
in
the
record,
at
2
o’clock,
there
is
this
capacity.
and
by
the
way,
it
is
not
capacity
because
the
record
shows
that
at
least
it
set
it
fourth
in
the
brief,
the
record
shows
that
capacity
goes
up
to
a
120%
and
not
the
99%
or
a
102%
that
the
parking
authority
garages
have.
now,
at
4
o’clock
and
at
6
o’clock
and
in
the
evening
and
on
weekends,
there
is
no
such
deficiency
your
honor.
that
4,100
spaces
is
only
at
the
peak
hour
of
2
o’clock
in
the
afternoon
and
possibly
12
o’clock
on
some
occasions.
if
you
will
look
on
page
640,
you
will
see
that
at
other
times,
there
is
not
that
peak
demand
on
that
deficiency
of
41
spaces.
that
is
an
estimate
by
wilbur
smith
associates
in
making
the
study
that
the
city
of
pittsburgh
overall
that
use
4,100
spaces,
that
does
not
say
that
the
parking
authority
garages
are
filled
24
hours
a
day
in
no
sense
and
they
are
not.
mr.
leonard
boreman
that
is
right.
mr.
leonard
boreman
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
boreman
and
the
supreme
court
found
that
they
did
not
have
to
do
it
in
the
commonwealth
court
would
find
that
they
cannot
do
it.
and
that's
because
at
other
times
of
the
day
other
than
peak
hours,
the
parking
authority
garage
is
not
filled
and
they
charge
lower
rates
and
if
the
private
garages
raise
their
rates
at
these
other
times
of
the
day,
that
lessens
their
competitive
ability.
for
example,
there
are
parking
authority
garage
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh
standing
on
one
corner
and
there
is
the
private
operator’s
garage
right
next
door.
now,
anybody
conversant
with
the
parking
business
will
tell
you
that
the
bread
and
butter
and
the
success
of
a
parking
garage
depends
on
short-term
parking,
one
two,
three,
and
four
hours.
if
you
look
at
our
record
in
exhibit
3,
you
will
see
that
for
those
short
periods
of
parking,
the
parking
authority
rates
are
50%
of
the
private
operators.
now,
if
we
are
expected
to
pass
it
on
and
charge
more,
we
increase
that
disparity.
so,
it
is
not
a
simple
question
of
some
statistical
4,100
space.
it
is
a
question
of
the
actual
facts
in
the
operation
of
parking
garages
in
the
city.
now
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
important
in
discussing
the
nature
of
this
tax.
that
this
tax
that
is
imposed
on
these
private
operators
is
20%,
a
tax
that
is
greater
than
to
my
knowledge
than
any
tax
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh
or
in
the
nation.
i
know
of
no
other
20%
excise
tax
anywhere
and
certainly,
no
20%
parking
tax.
it
is
a
selective
tax.
it
is
not
imposed
generally
on
the
city
of
pittsburgh.
it
is
imposed
on
this
small
group.
now,
in
addition
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh,
there
is
what
is
known
as
a
business
privilege
tax
and
it
is
tax
that
the
right
of
six
mills.
these
parking
operators
pay
that
tax
also
so
that
the
tax
for
the
privilege
of
conducting
business
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh
to
the
parking
operators
is
206
mills
whereas
every
other
business
in
the
city
pays
six
mills.
also
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh,
there
is
a
mercantile
tax
imposed
on
wholesale
and
retail
vendors
of
merchandise
at
the
right
of
1
mill.
now,
the
disparity
between
the
tax
imposed
on
this
selective
group
of
parking
operators
as
compared
to
all
other
businessmen
is
tremendous.
the
amount
imposed
on
this
people
is
34
and
a
third
times
more
than
any
other
business.
on
exhibit
3,
you
will
note
that
the
mercantile
tax
in
1969
obtained
for
the
city
is
$2
million.
that
is
overall
all
the
merchants
in
the
city,
7,200
merchants.
the
parking
operators
of
this
small
group
paid
equally
2
million.
the
business
privilege
tax
all
over
the
city
brought
in
four-and-a-half
million,
these
parking
operators
paid
2
million.
now,
i
might
say
at
the
same
time
that
there
are
no
extra
benefits
conferred
on
these
parking
operators
for
this
money.
there
are
no
extra
police.
the
record
is
replete
with
testimony
that
there
are
no
extra
police.
there
are
no
extra
services
and
there
is
no
particular
benefit
advanced
to
them.
mr.
leonard
boreman
not,
if
they
are
were
public
competition
your
honor.
if
the
factor
of
public
competition
by
the
parking
authority
weren't
here,
i
think
we
would
have
a
different
picture.
i
think
we
would
have
another
question,
but
i
would
not
take
that
position
at
this
point.
the
position
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
6,000.
mr.
leonard
boreman
in
the
downtown
section
of
the
city
which
is
where
the
concentration
is
24,000
all
together.
the
private
operator
operate
17,600
spaces
or
400
spaces.
the
parking
authority
operates
6,100
spaces
and
there
are
scattered
individual
lots
for
about
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
if
the
private
operators
were
compelled
to
increase
their
rates,
which
they
cannot
do
because
if
they
do,
they
make
the
competition
with
the
parking
authority
that
much
worse.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
it
can.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
it
can
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
to
stop
the
parking
authorities
from
building
new
garages.
you
exercise
the
power
beyond
the
domain.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
it
has
happened
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
boreman
no,
but
we
do
not
have
that
statistic,
your
honor,
but
we
do
have
one
statistic
in
the
record.
myers
brothers,
one
of
the
national
parking
chain,
one
of
the
largest
parking
operations
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh,
i
believe
their
capacity
about
over
2,000.
when
this
tax
became
15%,
they
tried
to
raise
the
rate.
they
found
that
their
business
decreased
by
about
25%,
it
is
in
the
record.
then
they
tried
again
to
raise
the
rate
at
the
end
of
1969
and
they
had
to
close
a
whole
floor
because
there
are
people
who
just
weren't
coming
in
because
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
no
average
vacancy,
but
there
is
a
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
--
on
page
640.
no
your
honor.
no,
they
are
not
always
full.
they
are
full
--
they
are
mostly
full
at
peak
hours
of
12
and
2,
but
not
at
4
and
6
in
the
evenings
and
weekends,
no.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes
your
honor.
yes,
except
for
the
peak
hours.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
boreman
they
were.
mr.
leonard
boreman
no
your
honor,
they
did
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
difficulties
that
exist
today
is
that
the
public
authority
itself
directs
and
fixes
the
rates
for
these
lessees
and
they
have
not
permitted
a
raise
in
rates
since
1952.
they
have
just
won’t
permit
a
raise
in
rates
and
the
loss
is
then
absorbed
by
these
lessees
because
it
isn't
the
lost
of
the
parking
authority.
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
agree.
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
agree
on
one
basis
that
that
is
an
actual
condemnation
and
i
would
say
that
constitutionally
they
would
have
to
pay
damages.
by
eminent
domain,
they
could
certainly
take
them
over.
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
would
say
that
that
is
itself
is
a
taking.
mr.
leonard
boreman
that
your
honor
comes
under
the
category
of
cases
i
think
your
honor
is
quite
familiar,
the
obnoxious
substance
cases.
i
think
the
government
could
ban
marijuana,
could
ban
alcohol,
could
ban
other
drugs.
i
think
they
came
under
the
obnoxious
substance
doctrine.
united
states
against
sanchez
for
example
is
an
example.
i
do
not
think
they
are
on
the
same
category
as
these
cases.
this
is
a
legitimate
biz.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
a
quasi
public
business.
mr.
leonard
boreman
it
is
now
because
of
the
eighteenth
amendment
i
think
but
possibly
before.
i
think,
as
i
recall
it,
i
think
there
is
a
case
cited
in
sax's
article
in
the
yale
law
journal
in
which
broery
was
put
out
of
business
by
a
zoning
ordinance
that
was
upheld
by
this
court.
i
think
before
the
eighteenth
amendment,
i
think
there
might
be
basis
for
prohibiting
businesses
that
might
be
called
obnoxious
substance.
but
this
is
a
legitimate
business
and
my
position
your
honor
is
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
taking.
now,
this
court
has
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
think
it
was
your
honor.
i
think
anything
in
excess
of
10%
(voice
overlap).
mr.
leonard
boreman
well,
the
tax
only
lasted
a
year.
the
parking
operators
wanted
to
see
if
they
could
live
with
it.
you
ask
why
they
hadn't
gone
out
of
business
today.
they
have
been
tying
to
see
if
they
could
live
with
it
all
through
this.
it
started
out
at
10%
in
1962
and
they
attacked
it.
by
the
way,
when
it
was
attacked
in
1962,
no
--
there
was
no
attack
on
the
basis
of
confiscation
or
on
the
basis
of
a
public
authority
competing.
if
you
look
at
the
opinion
which
declare
the
1962
ordinance
invalid,
you
will
see
that
the
court
said,
“we
cannot
say
there
is
confiscation
in
here
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
substantiate
it.
the
plaintiffs
did
not
put
any
record
in.”
now,
they
lived
with
the
10%
tax
until
1969.
it
was
raised
to
15%.
they
objected
vigorously
before
council
and
so
forth,
but
they
decided
to
live
with
it.
it
lasted
one
year,
and
then
the
city
again
came
along
and
raised
it
to
20%,
that
was
what
broke
the
camel’s
back
and
they
come
in
and
decided
to
fight
it.
mr.

it
shows

mr.

boreman
page

of
our
brief.
we
have
summarized
what
exhibit
1
shows.
now,
exhibit
1
is
a
compilation
which
we
made
from
the
books
and
records
of
this
plaintiff’s
in
which
we
showed
the
actual
record
of
1968
and
1969
and
the
record
for
the
first
6
months
of
1970
projected
on
the
same
basis
of
1969
for
the
whole
year
of
1970.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
your
honor.
it
shows.
if
you
will
note
that
on
46
locations,
it
shows
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
several
thousand
parking
spaces
your
honor,
46
locations,
17,000
spaces.
mr.
leonard
boreman
these
46
are
the
total
of
the
total
locations
in
the
downtown
area
of
pittsburgh.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
it
shows
a
gross
of
$8
million
and
on
the
basis
of
that
$8
million
with
the
parking
tax
at
20%,
there
is
a
loss
of
$270,000.
mr.
leonard
boreman
and
the
figures
in
1969
show
that
on
the
basis
of
$7
million
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes.
what
is
it
again
your
honor?
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes
your
honor.
well,
our
position
is
that
because
the
parking
authority
is
in
direct
competition
standing
right
next
door
to
many
of
these
garages
and
lots
and
charging
50%
already
less
than
what
we
have,
for
us
to
raise
the
rates
as
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
wants.
mr.
leonard
boreman
well
your
honor,
i
wish
that
that
was
easy
as
you
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
want
to
say
that
under
this
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leonard
boreman
no
your
honor.
i
am
arguing
that
this
is
a
taking
and
i
am
arguing
that
this
is
a
condemnation
taking
under
the
fifth
amendment
prohibited
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
states
and
the
cities.
mr.
leonard
boreman
well,
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
part
of
the
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
oh
and
that
is
right
your
honor.
no,
your
honor.
no,
i
abandoned
that
argument
your
honor
because
i
am
afraid
that
it
is
a
hopeless
attempt.
mr.
leonard
boreman
25%.
mr.
leonard
boreman
and
there
is
4%
scattered
around
the
small
operates.
mr.
leonard
boreman
no,
not
the
last
10
years.
your
honor,
let
me
say
this.
when
the
parking
authority
was
organized,
there
were
three
garages
originally.
it
increased
to
8.
there
are
now
15
and
in
the
last
5
years,
i
think
there
have
been
about
3
or
4
parking
garages
organized.
now,
they
all
were
in
the
downtown
area
by
the
way.
some
of
them
were
in
what
is
known
as
a
subsidiary
business
area
what
we
call
east
liberty
for
example
or
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
exhibit
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
exhibit
11,
which
i
think
is
the
study
by
wilbur
smith,
yes.
yes,
there
are
statistics
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
boreman
that
commences
on
page
616
of
the
record.
mr.
leonard
boreman
it
is
quite
a
lengthy
study
and
i
cannot
put
my
figure
on
the
exact
spot
where
it
gives
the
number
of
parking
authority
garages
but
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
we
have
placed
in
the
record
all
of
them
because
since
this
case
was
tried,
there
are
several
new
ones.
i
am
referring
to
the
wilbur
smith
study
which
is
quite
lengthy
and
which
was
prepared
for
the
parking
authority
in
1969.
i
might
add
this,
your
honors
too.
we
have
in
pittsburgh
another
public
authority
called
the
auditorium
authority
and
there
the
authority
that
built
the
three
rivers
stadium
and
also
our
civic
arena
and
they
have
in
turn,
the
auditorium
authority
for
example
has
leased
the
parking
space
to
the
public
parking
authority
itself
and
the
authority
in
turn
has
leased
it
to
one
of
this
plaintiffs,
alco
parking
to
operate
for
them.
so,
in
addition
to
the
normal
parking
authority
spaces
in
the
downtown
central
location
of
pittsburgh,
the
three
rivers
stadium
authority
which
i
think
is
over
2000
to
3000
spaces
is
also
run
by
a
public
authority
leasing
to
the
parking
authority
and
there
are
other
public
bodies
doing
the
same
thing.
we
have
in
pittsburgh
this
authority
operation
of
public
parking
facilities
all
in
competition
with
private
operators.
i
do
not
think
that
the
question
of
whether
the
rate
could
be
passed
on
is
open
to
a
factual
examination
by
this
court
especially
when
the
supreme
court
has
so
found
it
and
although
the
court
of
course
is
free
to
make
it,
i
submit
that
it
is
a
factual
finding
found
by
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
in
this
file.
i
would
like
to
say
your
honor
that
this
court
on
many
occasions
has
not
hesitated
to
declare
a
taking
where
the
police
power
has
been
exercised,
and
i
am
thinking
of
cases
like
pennsylvania
against
maine
and
united
states
against
--
cases
like
pennsylvania
against
maine
and
other
cases
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
dealing
with
the
regulations
of
the
police
power,
also
cases
like
us
versus
causby,
the
airline
cases,
griggs
versus
allegheny
county
and
the
case
of
armstrong
against
the
united
states
where
this
court
determined
that
the
immunity
of
suit
privilege
given
to
the
united
states
does
not
protect
it
against
a
claim
of
a
mechanics
lien
holder.
now,
i
say
there
is
no
reason
in
my
mind
why
the
same
principle
cannot
be
applied
to
a
taxing
statute.
and
i
think
the
comment
or
rather
the
study
made
by
professor
sax
in
the
yale
law
journal
is
a
very
cogent
treatment.
the
supreme
court
adverted
to
it
and
i
submit
that
it
is
a
rationale
theory
as
to
the
fact
that
the
excessive
imposition
of
attacks
cannot
be
equally
at
taking
as
the
excessive
and
the
wrongful
imposition
of
a
police
power
statute.
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
whether
that
would
be
a
taking
or
not
because
it
seems
to
me
that
unless
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
as
a
police
power
regulation?
that
then
your
honor
it
seems
to
me
tire
in
with
the
sax
thesis.
there
you
do
not
have
a
government
enterprise.
you
do
not
have
a
government
resource
enterprise
operating.
it
has
not
itself
going
into
an
enterprise
activity
in
competition.
it
has
made
a
police
power
regulation
in
which
it
says
that
for
the
benefit
of
all,
health
wise
let
us
say
we
will
bar
parking.
that
is
a
different
story
that
might
be
under
sax’s
rationale
that
that
is
a
legitimate
activity.
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
think
there
they
would
have
to
pay
compensation
because
that
is
a
resource
activity.
i
think
to
place
of
the
burden
of
the
cost
of
that
on
a
smaller
selective
group
is
exactly
the
idea
and
the
thing
that
ought
to
be
prohibited.
there,
they
take
on
a
resource
activity,
but
now
i
say
that
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
on
the
parking
authority?
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes.
mr.
leonard
boreman
but
the
parking
authority
does
not,
there
are
other
advantages
which
enables
it
to
charge
lower
rates.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes
and
would
still
be
the
truth
if
they
did
what
you
say.
mr.
leonard
boreman
because
by
reason
--
because
number
one
this
tax
is
so
excessive
and
number
2
by
reason
of
the
other
advantages,
we
still
cannot
compete.
it
is
the
excessive
tax
in
addition
and
you
say
as
they
put
it
on
both
the
parking
authority
still
has
the
advantages
of
no
real
estate
tax,
no
income
tax.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes
but
now
--
but
they
always
didn't
have
a
20%
tax,
now
what
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leonard
boreman
no
your
honor.
no,
they
are
full
at
certain
peak
hours
with
another
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
generally,
yes.
mr.
leonard
boreman
that
maybe
right
so
that
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
your
business
does
not
just
go
on
for
2
hours
a
day
your
honor,
it
goes
along
for
24
hours.
mr.
leonard
boreman
well,
how
much
could
you
raise
if
the
record
shows
that
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
well,
the
problem
has
been
solved
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
boreman
the
problem
has
been
solved
in
a
month.
mr.
leonard
boreman
well,
let
me
point
this
out
as
the
record
shows
by
the
testimony
of
the
city
treasure
that
in
order
to
overcome
this
20%
tax,
you
got
to
raise
your
rates
25%.
now,
how
much
can
your
raise
it
even
in
that
peak
hour?
mr.
leonard
boreman
that
is
for
the
2
hours.
mr.
leonard
boreman
that
is
not
for
the
rest
of
the
day.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
it
would
help
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
boreman
may
point
out
another
factor.
it
is
not
only
the
parking
authority
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
no,
your
honor
we
want
businesses
fair.
it
isn't
only
the
parking
authority
being
50%
of
the
raise.
do
not
forget
hundreds
of
thousands
of
shoppers
if
the
rates
get
too
high
and
it
becomes
too
expensive
to
come
in
time,
aren't
going
to
come
in
time.
they
are
going
to
stay
away
and
go
out
to
the
shopping
centers.
this
is
a
business
decision
that
we
got
to
consider
too
in
raising
rates.
in
other
words,
you
just
do
not
say,
“well,
it
is
the
tax
at
20%
raise
to
25
and
everything
will
be
hunky
dory.”
it
is
a
serious
business
decision.
now,
what
i
would
like
to
say
and
i
think
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
it
is
not
just
and
mr.
justice
brennan
it
is
not
just
the
parking
authority
existing,
it
is
the
combination
of
this
very
excessive
rate
plus
the
competition.
a
parking
rate
of
say
5%
or
6
mills
or
10
mills
or
10%
plus
the
competition
might
not
be
a
taking.
it
is
the
unheard
of
unequal
in
anywhere
in
the
country
of
20%.
mr.
leonard
boreman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
it
is
necessary
at
the
outset
to
pose
the
issue
in
this
case,
which
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
posed.
in
the
opening
paragraph
of
the
opinion
and
that
is
where
a
city
imposes
a
20%
excise
tax
or
parking
tax
and
that
is
combined
with
the
governmental
operation
of
the
exact
identical
business,
does
that
constitute
a
taking
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
rather
i
should
say
under
the
fifth
amendment
made
unlawful
by
the
states
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
now,
that
is
the
issue.
the
issue
was
not
whether
a
tax
standing
by
itself
is
unconstitutional
and
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
city
has
the
power
to
impose
an
excise
tax
on
these
parking
operators
and
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
city
has
the
power
to
compete
with
the
parking
operators
in
conducting
a
parking
business.
of
course,
there
is
no
question
about
any
of
those
issues,
but
the
issue
is,
can
the
city
impose
a
20%
tax
which
the
commonwealth
court
has
declared
by
an
unanimous
vote
of
the
excessive
and
unreasonable
and
which
the
supreme
court
has
said
is
excessive
and
unreasonable
and
when
combined
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
let
me
explain
that
your
honor.
the
supreme
court,
justice
robert
said
and
adverted
to
invalidation
of
the
tax
against
the
parking
authority,
but
he
said
that
did
influence
his
decision.
he
said
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
parking
authority
outside
of
the
parking
tax
has
total
exemption
from
all
property
taxes,
exemption
from
all
income
taxes,
low
cost
financing,
long-term
financing,
the
power
of
eminent
domain
under
its
statute,
that
these
are
such
great
advantages
that
they
alone
enable
the
parking
authority
to
charge
lower
rates
and
that
adding
the
exemption
of
the
parking
tax
makes
it
even
worse.
now,
may
i
explain
this
part?
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
beg
pardon?
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
think
it
would
be,
your
honor,
yes,
if
the
fact
show,
but
we
think
this
record
shows
and
what
i
propose
to
discuss
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
there,
i
think
there
might
be
a
proper
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
let
me
explain
that,
your
honor
because
i
am
counsel
in
the
case
which
invalidated
the
parking
for
these,
some
of
these
same
plaintiffs,
but
there
are
others.
there
are
some
very
large
interests
who
are
not
placed
in
this
case.
this
is
the
way
the
parking
authority
works.
the
parking
authority
was
created
by
the
legislature
of
pennsylvania
by
the
act
of
1947.
it
authorized
municipalities
to
setup
parking
authorities.
the
city
of
pittsburgh
setup
a
parking
authority.
the
parking
authority
went
out
and
with
the
low
cost
financing
and
long-term
financing
and
with
tax
exemption,
issued
bonds
to
build
these
structures.
they
then
proceeded
to
the
lease
these
garages
to
private
operators.
now,
under
the
terms
of
the
lease,
these
private
operators
pay
a
flat
rate.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
your
honor.
the
parking
authority
operates
a
few
small
lots
where
they
have
parking
meters
i
think
by
themselves,
but
most
of
them
are.
now,
these
operators
pay
a
rent
which
is
enough
to
cover
the
amortization
of
the
bonds,
and
then
they
share
the
profit
with
the
parking
authority
50/50.
now,
these
private
operators,
when
i
say
share
their
profit
50/50,
that
is
after
all
expenses,
so
that
the
burden
of
the
expenses
are
on
these
private
operators
even
though
they
are
operating
the
parking
authority
garages.
if
there
is
a
profit,
the
parking
authority
shares
50%
of
the
profit.
consequently,
if
this
tax
remains
valid
against
the
parking
authority,
these
private
operators
must
add
to
their
expenses
the
amount
of
the
parking
tax.
so,
they
went
into
court
and
i
acted
as
their
counsel
and
the
commonwealth
court
has
so
held,
that
i
might
say
it
is
completely
under
pennsylvania
precedent.
it
is
cited
in
justice
roberts’
opinion.
that
they
went
into
court
to
have
it
declared
--
to
have
the
exemption
in
favor
of
the
parking
authority
declared
and
the
commonwealth
so
declared.
the
case
is
now
on
petition
for
a
(voice

mr.
leonard
boreman
i
beg
pardon
sir.
mr.
leonard
boreman
the
tax
cannot
be
passed
on
for
a
several
reasons,
your
honor.
number
one,
there
is
testimony
in
this
record
by
a
number
of
these
plaintiffs
who
by
the
way
are
probably
the
most
experienced
parking
operators
in
the
united
states.
one
operator,
the
operator
of
alco
parking
and
the
others,
may
i
just
go
on
with
this,
your
honor
and
i
will
explain
why,
is
the
largest
parking
operator
in
pittsburgh,
has
been
an
operator
for
over
50
years.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
your
honor,
yes
your
honor.
the
other
one
operating
stanwicks
auto
park
is
a
member
of
the
board
of
directors
of
the
national
parking
association.
these
are
experts.
they
have
testified
that
in
their
experience
as
parking
operators,
if
they
are
charging
and
getting
as
much
as
they
can
get,
they
say
and
they
testify,
they
charge
the
highest
rate.
they'd
be
a
fools
not
to
get
lower
if
they
could.
now,
with
the
competition
of
the
parking
authority
garages
sitting
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
well,
the
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
it
is
a
misleading
figure
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
boreman
well,
i
am
not
being
an
expert
on
this
subject,
i
cannot
say
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
there
is
no
actual
testimony.
no,
it
is
a
figure
given
by
wilbur
smith
who
did
a
study
for
the
parking
authority.
mr.
leonard
boreman
it
is
in
the
record.
he
came
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
no
your
honor
because
there
is
no
expert
testimony
that
contradicts
and
i
would
not
want
to
contradict
that,
but
i
would
want
to
explain
it
your
honor.
i
say
that
it
is
a
misleading
figure.
if
you
read
that
record
in
which
that
4,000
figure
is
given,
it
just
says,
it
is
an
overall
average
for
the
whole
city
based
on
the
examination
of
traffic,
congestion,
on
needs
and
so
forth.
now
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
your
honor
but
it
is
the
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
well,
i
think
it
needs
--
it
requires
and
deserves
explaining
your
honor.
that
is
4,000
deficiently
is
that
-
mr.
leonard
boreman
good.
at
2
o’clock,
as
the
studies
will
show
and
it
is
in
the
record,
at
2
o’clock,
there
is
this
capacity.
and
by
the
way,
it
is
not
capacity
because
the
record
shows
that
at
least
it
set
it
fourth
in
the
brief,
the
record
shows
that
capacity
goes
up
to
a
120%
and
not
the
99%
or
a
102%
that
the
parking
authority
garages
have.
now,
at
4
o’clock
and
at
6
o’clock
and
in
the
evening
and
on
weekends,
there
is
no
such
deficiency
your
honor.
that
4,100
spaces
is
only
at
the
peak
hour
of
2
o’clock
in
the
afternoon
and
possibly
12
o’clock
on
some
occasions.
if
you
will
look
on
page
640,
you
will
see
that
at
other
times,
there
is
not
that
peak
demand
on
that
deficiency
of
41
spaces.
that
is
an
estimate
by
wilbur
smith
associates
in
making
the
study
that
the
city
of
pittsburgh
overall
that
use
4,100
spaces,
that
does
not
say
that
the
parking
authority
garages
are
filled
24
hours
a
day
in
no
sense
and
they
are
not.
mr.
leonard
boreman
that
is
right.
mr.
leonard
boreman
that
is
right
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
boreman
and
the
supreme
court
found
that
they
did
not
have
to
do
it
in
the
commonwealth
court
would
find
that
they
cannot
do
it.
and
that's
because
at
other
times
of
the
day
other
than
peak
hours,
the
parking
authority
garage
is
not
filled
and
they
charge
lower
rates
and
if
the
private
garages
raise
their
rates
at
these
other
times
of
the
day,
that
lessens
their
competitive
ability.
for
example,
there
are
parking
authority
garage
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh
standing
on
one
corner
and
there
is
the
private
operator’s
garage
right
next
door.
now,
anybody
conversant
with
the
parking
business
will
tell
you
that
the
bread
and
butter
and
the
success
of
a
parking
garage
depends
on
short-term
parking,
one
two,
three,
and
four
hours.
if
you
look
at
our
record
in
exhibit
3,
you
will
see
that
for
those
short
periods
of
parking,
the
parking
authority
rates
are
50%
of
the
private
operators.
now,
if
we
are
expected
to
pass
it
on
and
charge
more,
we
increase
that
disparity.
so,
it
is
not
a
simple
question
of
some
statistical
4,100
space.
it
is
a
question
of
the
actual
facts
in
the
operation
of
parking
garages
in
the
city.
now
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
important
in
discussing
the
nature
of
this
tax.
that
this
tax
that
is
imposed
on
these
private
operators
is
20%,
a
tax
that
is
greater
than
to
my
knowledge
than
any
tax
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh
or
in
the
nation.
i
know
of
no
other
20%
excise
tax
anywhere
and
certainly,
no
20%
parking
tax.
it
is
a
selective
tax.
it
is
not
imposed
generally
on
the
city
of
pittsburgh.
it
is
imposed
on
this
small
group.
now,
in
addition
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh,
there
is
what
is
known
as
a
business
privilege
tax
and
it
is
tax
that
the
right
of
six
mills.
these
parking
operators
pay
that
tax
also
so
that
the
tax
for
the
privilege
of
conducting
business
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh
to
the
parking
operators
is
206
mills
whereas
every
other
business
in
the
city
pays
six
mills.
also
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh,
there
is
a
mercantile
tax
imposed
on
wholesale
and
retail
vendors
of
merchandise
at
the
right
of
1
mill.
now,
the
disparity
between
the
tax
imposed
on
this
selective
group
of
parking
operators
as
compared
to
all
other
businessmen
is
tremendous.
the
amount
imposed
on
this
people
is
34
and
a
third
times
more
than
any
other
business.
on
exhibit
3,
you
will
note
that
the
mercantile
tax
in
1969
obtained
for
the
city
is
$2
million.
that
is
overall
all
the
merchants
in
the
city,
7,200
merchants.
the
parking
operators
of
this
small
group
paid
equally
2
million.
the
business
privilege
tax
all
over
the
city
brought
in
four-and-a-half
million,
these
parking
operators
paid
2
million.
now,
i
might
say
at
the
same
time
that
there
are
no
extra
benefits
conferred
on
these
parking
operators
for
this
money.
there
are
no
extra
police.
the
record
is
replete
with
testimony
that
there
are
no
extra
police.
there
are
no
extra
services
and
there
is
no
particular
benefit
advanced
to
them.
mr.
leonard
boreman
not,
if
they
are
were
public
competition
your
honor.
if
the
factor
of
public
competition
by
the
parking
authority
weren't
here,
i
think
we
would
have
a
different
picture.
i
think
we
would
have
another
question,
but
i
would
not
take
that
position
at
this
point.
the
position
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
6,000.
mr.
leonard
boreman
in
the
downtown
section
of
the
city
which
is
where
the
concentration
is
24,000
all
together.
the
private
operator
operate
17,600
spaces
or
400
spaces.
the
parking
authority
operates
6,100
spaces
and
there
are
scattered
individual
lots
for
about
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
if
the
private
operators
were
compelled
to
increase
their
rates,
which
they
cannot
do
because
if
they
do,
they
make
the
competition
with
the
parking
authority
that
much
worse.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
it
can.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
it
can
your
honor.
there
is
nothing
to
stop
the
parking
authorities
from
building
new
garages.
you
exercise
the
power
beyond
the
domain.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
it
has
happened
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
boreman
no,
but
we
do
not
have
that
statistic,
your
honor,
but
we
do
have
one
statistic
in
the
record.
myers
brothers,
one
of
the
national
parking
chain,
one
of
the
largest
parking
operations
in
the
city
of
pittsburgh,
i
believe
their
capacity
about
over
2,000.
when
this
tax
became
15%,
they
tried
to
raise
the
rate.
they
found
that
their
business
decreased
by
about
25%,
it
is
in
the
record.
then
they
tried
again
to
raise
the
rate
at
the
end
of
1969
and
they
had
to
close
a
whole
floor
because
there
are
people
who
just
weren't
coming
in
because
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
no
average
vacancy,
but
there
is
a
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
--
on
page
640.
no
your
honor.
no,
they
are
not
always
full.
they
are
full
--
they
are
mostly
full
at
peak
hours
of
12
and
2,
but
not
at
4
and
6
in
the
evenings
and
weekends,
no.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes
your
honor.
yes,
except
for
the
peak
hours.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
boreman
they
were.
mr.
leonard
boreman
no
your
honor,
they
did
not.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
difficulties
that
exist
today
is
that
the
public
authority
itself
directs
and
fixes
the
rates
for
these
lessees
and
they
have
not
permitted
a
raise
in
rates
since
1952.
they
have
just
won’t
permit
a
raise
in
rates
and
the
loss
is
then
absorbed
by
these
lessees
because
it
isn't
the
lost
of
the
parking
authority.
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
agree.
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
agree
on
one
basis
that
that
is
an
actual
condemnation
and
i
would
say
that
constitutionally
they
would
have
to
pay
damages.
by
eminent
domain,
they
could
certainly
take
them
over.
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
would
say
that
that
is
itself
is
a
taking.
mr.
leonard
boreman
that
your
honor
comes
under
the
category
of
cases
i
think
your
honor
is
quite
familiar,
the
obnoxious
substance
cases.
i
think
the
government
could
ban
marijuana,
could
ban
alcohol,
could
ban
other
drugs.
i
think
they
came
under
the
obnoxious
substance
doctrine.
united
states
against
sanchez
for
example
is
an
example.
i
do
not
think
they
are
on
the
same
category
as
these
cases.
this
is
a
legitimate
biz.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
a
quasi
public
business.
mr.
leonard
boreman
it
is
now
because
of
the
eighteenth
amendment
i
think
but
possibly
before.
i
think,
as
i
recall
it,
i
think
there
is
a
case
cited
in
sax's
article
in
the
yale
law
journal
in
which
broery
was
put
out
of
business
by
a
zoning
ordinance
that
was
upheld
by
this
court.
i
think
before
the
eighteenth
amendment,
i
think
there
might
be
basis
for
prohibiting
businesses
that
might
be
called
obnoxious
substance.
but
this
is
a
legitimate
business
and
my
position
your
honor
is
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
taking.
now,
this
court
has
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
think
it
was
your
honor.
i
think
anything
in
excess
of
10%
(voice
overlap).
mr.
leonard
boreman
well,
the
tax
only
lasted
a
year.
the
parking
operators
wanted
to
see
if
they
could
live
with
it.
you
ask
why
they
hadn't
gone
out
of
business
today.
they
have
been
tying
to
see
if
they
could
live
with
it
all
through
this.
it
started
out
at
10%
in
1962
and
they
attacked
it.
by
the
way,
when
it
was
attacked
in
1962,
no
--
there
was
no
attack
on
the
basis
of
confiscation
or
on
the
basis
of
a
public
authority
competing.
if
you
look
at
the
opinion
which
declare
the
1962
ordinance
invalid,
you
will
see
that
the
court
said,
“we
cannot
say
there
is
confiscation
in
here
because
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
substantiate
it.
the
plaintiffs
did
not
put
any
record
in.”
now,
they
lived
with
the
10%
tax
until
1969.
it
was
raised
to
15%.
they
objected
vigorously
before
council
and
so
forth,
but
they
decided
to
live
with
it.
it
lasted
one
year,
and
then
the
city
again
came
along
and
raised
it
to
20%,
that
was
what
broke
the
camel’s
back
and
they
come
in
and
decided
to
fight
it.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes
your
honor.
exhibit

is
a

mr.
leonard
boreman
page
48
of
our
brief
your
honor,
summarizes
the
whole
experience
or
the
whole
record
of
exhibit

it
shows
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
page
48
of
our
brief.
we
have
summarized
what
exhibit
1
shows.
now,
exhibit
1
is
a
compilation
which
we
made
from
the
books
and
records
of
this
plaintiff’s
in
which
we
showed
the
actual
record
of
1968
and
1969
and
the
record
for
the
first
6
months
of
1970
projected
on
the
same
basis
of
1969
for
the
whole
year
of
1970.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
your
honor.
it
shows.
if
you
will
note
that
on
46
locations,
it
shows
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
several
thousand
parking
spaces
your
honor,
46
locations,
17,000
spaces.
mr.
leonard
boreman
these
46
are
the
total
of
the
total
locations
in
the
downtown
area
of
pittsburgh.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
it
shows
a
gross
of
$8
million
and
on
the
basis
of
that
$8
million
with
the
parking
tax
at
20%,
there
is
a
loss
of
$270,000.
mr.
leonard
boreman
and
the
figures
in
1969
show
that
on
the
basis
of
$7
million
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes.
what
is
it
again
your
honor?
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes
your
honor.
well,
our
position
is
that
because
the
parking
authority
is
in
direct
competition
standing
right
next
door
to
many
of
these
garages
and
lots
and
charging
50%
already
less
than
what
we
have,
for
us
to
raise
the
rates
as
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
wants.
mr.
leonard
boreman
well
your
honor,
i
wish
that
that
was
easy
as
you
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
want
to
say
that
under
this
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leonard
boreman
no
your
honor.
i
am
arguing
that
this
is
a
taking
and
i
am
arguing
that
this
is
a
condemnation
taking
under
the
fifth
amendment
prohibited
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
states
and
the
cities.
mr.
leonard
boreman
well,
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
part
of
the
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
oh
and
that
is
right
your
honor.
no,
your
honor.
no,
i
abandoned
that
argument
your
honor
because
i
am
afraid
that
it
is
a
hopeless
attempt.
mr.
leonard
boreman
25%.
mr.
leonard
boreman
and
there
is
4%
scattered
around
the
small
operates.
mr.
leonard
boreman
no,
not
the
last
10
years.
your
honor,
let
me
say
this.
when
the
parking
authority
was
organized,
there
were
three
garages
originally.
it
increased
to
8.
there
are
now
15
and
in
the
last
5
years,
i
think
there
have
been
about
3
or
4
parking
garages
organized.
now,
they
all
were
in
the
downtown
area
by
the
way.
some
of
them
were
in
what
is
known
as
a
subsidiary
business
area
what
we
call
east
liberty
for
example
or
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
exhibit
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
exhibit
11,
which
i
think
is
the
study
by
wilbur
smith,
yes.
yes,
there
are
statistics
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
boreman
that
commences
on
page
616
of
the
record.
mr.
leonard
boreman
it
is
quite
a
lengthy
study
and
i
cannot
put
my
figure
on
the
exact
spot
where
it
gives
the
number
of
parking
authority
garages
but
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
we
have
placed
in
the
record
all
of
them
because
since
this
case
was
tried,
there
are
several
new
ones.
i
am
referring
to
the
wilbur
smith
study
which
is
quite
lengthy
and
which
was
prepared
for
the
parking
authority
in
1969.
i
might
add
this,
your
honors
too.
we
have
in
pittsburgh
another
public
authority
called
the
auditorium
authority
and
there
the
authority
that
built
the
three
rivers
stadium
and
also
our
civic
arena
and
they
have
in
turn,
the
auditorium
authority
for
example
has
leased
the
parking
space
to
the
public
parking
authority
itself
and
the
authority
in
turn
has
leased
it
to
one
of
this
plaintiffs,
alco
parking
to
operate
for
them.
so,
in
addition
to
the
normal
parking
authority
spaces
in
the
downtown
central
location
of
pittsburgh,
the
three
rivers
stadium
authority
which
i
think
is
over
2000
to
3000
spaces
is
also
run
by
a
public
authority
leasing
to
the
parking
authority
and
there
are
other
public
bodies
doing
the
same
thing.
we
have
in
pittsburgh
this
authority
operation
of
public
parking
facilities
all
in
competition
with
private
operators.
i
do
not
think
that
the
question
of
whether
the
rate
could
be
passed
on
is
open
to
a
factual
examination
by
this
court
especially
when
the
supreme
court
has
so
found
it
and
although
the
court
of
course
is
free
to
make
it,
i
submit
that
it
is
a
factual
finding
found
by
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
in
this
file.
i
would
like
to
say
your
honor
that
this
court
on
many
occasions
has
not
hesitated
to
declare
a
taking
where
the
police
power
has
been
exercised,
and
i
am
thinking
of
cases
like
pennsylvania
against
maine
and
united
states
against
--
cases
like
pennsylvania
against
maine
and
other
cases
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
dealing
with
the
regulations
of
the
police
power,
also
cases
like
us
versus
causby,
the
airline
cases,
griggs
versus
allegheny
county
and
the
case
of
armstrong
against
the
united
states
where
this
court
determined
that
the
immunity
of
suit
privilege
given
to
the
united
states
does
not
protect
it
against
a
claim
of
a
mechanics
lien
holder.
now,
i
say
there
is
no
reason
in
my
mind
why
the
same
principle
cannot
be
applied
to
a
taxing
statute.
and
i
think
the
comment
or
rather
the
study
made
by
professor
sax
in
the
yale
law
journal
is
a
very
cogent
treatment.
the
supreme
court
adverted
to
it
and
i
submit
that
it
is
a
rationale
theory
as
to
the
fact
that
the
excessive
imposition
of
attacks
cannot
be
equally
at
taking
as
the
excessive
and
the
wrongful
imposition
of
a
police
power
statute.
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
whether
that
would
be
a
taking
or
not
because
it
seems
to
me
that
unless
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
as
a
police
power
regulation?
that
then
your
honor
it
seems
to
me
tire
in
with
the
sax
thesis.
there
you
do
not
have
a
government
enterprise.
you
do
not
have
a
government
resource
enterprise
operating.
it
has
not
itself
going
into
an
enterprise
activity
in
competition.
it
has
made
a
police
power
regulation
in
which
it
says
that
for
the
benefit
of
all,
health
wise
let
us
say
we
will
bar
parking.
that
is
a
different
story
that
might
be
under
sax’s
rationale
that
that
is
a
legitimate
activity.
mr.
leonard
boreman
i
think
there
they
would
have
to
pay
compensation
because
that
is
a
resource
activity.
i
think
to
place
of
the
burden
of
the
cost
of
that
on
a
smaller
selective
group
is
exactly
the
idea
and
the
thing
that
ought
to
be
prohibited.
there,
they
take
on
a
resource
activity,
but
now
i
say
that
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
on
the
parking
authority?
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes.
mr.
leonard
boreman
but
the
parking
authority
does
not,
there
are
other
advantages
which
enables
it
to
charge
lower
rates.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes
and
would
still
be
the
truth
if
they
did
what
you
say.
mr.
leonard
boreman
because
by
reason
--
because
number
one
this
tax
is
so
excessive
and
number
2
by
reason
of
the
other
advantages,
we
still
cannot
compete.
it
is
the
excessive
tax
in
addition
and
you
say
as
they
put
it
on
both
the
parking
authority
still
has
the
advantages
of
no
real
estate
tax,
no
income
tax.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes
but
now
--
but
they
always
didn't
have
a
20%
tax,
now
what
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
leonard
boreman
no
your
honor.
no,
they
are
full
at
certain
peak
hours
with
another
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
generally,
yes.
mr.
leonard
boreman
that
maybe
right
so
that
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
your
business
does
not
just
go
on
for
2
hours
a
day
your
honor,
it
goes
along
for
24
hours.
mr.
leonard
boreman
well,
how
much
could
you
raise
if
the
record
shows
that
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
well,
the
problem
has
been
solved
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
boreman
the
problem
has
been
solved
in
a
month.
mr.
leonard
boreman
well,
let
me
point
this
out
as
the
record
shows
by
the
testimony
of
the
city
treasure
that
in
order
to
overcome
this
20%
tax,
you
got
to
raise
your
rates
25%.
now,
how
much
can
your
raise
it
even
in
that
peak
hour?
mr.
leonard
boreman
that
is
for
the
2
hours.
mr.
leonard
boreman
that
is
not
for
the
rest
of
the
day.
mr.
leonard
boreman
yes,
it
would
help
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
boreman
may
point
out
another
factor.
it
is
not
only
the
parking
authority
--
mr.
leonard
boreman
no,
your
honor
we
want
businesses
fair.
it
isn't
only
the
parking
authority
being
50%
of
the
raise.
do
not
forget
hundreds
of
thousands
of
shoppers
if
the
rates
get
too
high
and
it
becomes
too
expensive
to
come
in
time,
aren't
going
to
come
in
time.
they
are
going
to
stay
away
and
go
out
to
the
shopping
centers.
this
is
a
business
decision
that
we
got
to
consider
too
in
raising
rates.
in
other
words,
you
just
do
not
say,
“well,
it
is
the
tax
at
20%
raise
to
25
and
everything
will
be
hunky
dory.”
it
is
a
serious
business
decision.
now,
what
i
would
like
to
say
and
i
think
in
answer
to
your
question
mr.
chief
justice
is
that
it
is
not
just
and
mr.
justice
brennan
it
is
not
just
the
parking
authority
existing,
it
is
the
combination
of
this
very
excessive
rate
plus
the
competition.
a
parking
rate
of
say
5%
or
6
mills
or
10
mills
or
10%
plus
the
competition
might
not
be
a
taking.
it
is
the
unheard
of
unequal
in
anywhere
in
the
country
of
20%.
