that
is
location
and
the
site?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
ingress
and
digress
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
that
is
all,
but
they
do
not
prohibit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
zoning
coordinates
mr.
lynch,
are
there
any
which
prohibit
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
prohibit
commercial
parking
in
section
-
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
a
spread,
a
very
large
one
between
what
the
private
lots
charge
and
what
the
municipal
operated
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
much
lower
or?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes,
and
this
has
always
been
so?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
have
the
rates
for
the
private
lots
gone
up
in
larger
percentage
than
the
rates
for
the
publicly
operated
lots?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
i
guess
mr.
lynch,
the
private
parking
group
brought
the
litigation,
which
invalidated
the
tax
against
the
authority?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
was
this?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
rate
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
authority
was
paying
20%?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
you
still
have
to
pay
it
or
would
have
to
pay
it,
if
you
prevail?
if
the
private
operators
will
have
to
pay
it
if
you
prevail?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
boreman,
is
that
in
the
context
where
those
holdings
in
the
context
of
the
parking
authority
itself
being
subject
to
the
tax
or
was
this
after
the
invalidation
of
the
taxes
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
every
one
of
them
lease
to
a
private
operator?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
everyone?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
might
he
be
operating
some
of
parking
authority
unto
a
lease
as
well
as
independently?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when
myer’s
tried
to
raise
its
rates
at
the
time,
as
i
understand
you
when
the
tax
were
15%.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
were
the
public
authority
lots
are
also
paying
the
15%
tax?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
at
that
time?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
they
try
to
raise
it?
did
they
try
to
raise
their
rates,
the
public
authority?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
suppose
that
they
just
bar
it
all
downtown
parking?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
as
far
as
they
are
exposed,
they
do
it
to
--
see
to
it
that
people
come
in
the
center
of
town
on
a
publicly
owned
bus
system
or
subway
system
or
some
such
reasons
as
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
always
had
that
and
they
never
put
this
special
tax
on
it.
they
always
have
those
advantages,
isn't
it?

justice
william
j.

that
