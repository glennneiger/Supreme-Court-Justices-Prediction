in

1971,
is
alleged
in
the
complaint
to
be
a

and
fortnightly
against

this

held

a

two
issues
are

by
these
petitions.
first,
the
main
petition,
the
so-called
distant
signal
issue.
does
the
location
of
the
catv’s

on
which
the
broadcasts
were
received

than
a
few

from

it
did
not
--
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
antenna
location
and
the
connection
to
the
antenna
have
copyright
significance.
second,
the
conditional
cross-petition
raises
the
issue
whether
the
reception
of
a
broadcast
by
a
catv
system
is
converted
into
a
performance
of
the
broadcast
work
not
by
what
the
catv
system
did
with
reference
to
the
broadcast
copyrighted
work
but
by
reason
of
what
the
catv
system
did
on
separate
channels
not
used
to
receive
broadcasts
and
not
involving
cbs’s
copyrights.
both
courts
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
the
issue
of
microwave
is
not
up
in
this
petition.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
and
the
sale
of
commercial.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
both
courts
below
held
that
those
three
activities
did
not
have
a
spillover
effect
on
the
reception
service
and
held
that
it
did
not
change
it
into
a
performance.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
turn
first
to
the
leading
question
of
the
distant
signal
issue.
fortnightly
as
the
court
will
recall
involve
two
catv
systems
in
west
virginia,
one
in
clarksburg,
one
in
fairmont
which
received
pittsburg
and
other
stations
60
to
80
miles
away.
in
fortnightly
the
issue
was
whether
the
reception
of
--
by
the
two
catv
systems
was
a
performance
and
hence
an
infringement.
in
holding
that
this
--
that
the
reception
service
by
those
two
catv
systems
was
not
a
performance,
this
court
did
not
discuss
the
receiving
antenna
or
its
location
in
relationship
to
the
catv
communities
which
had
granted
a
franchise
to
the
fortnightly
catv’s.
there
were
actually
five
towns
that
had
granted
franchises
to
the
clarksburg
catv
and
two
to
the
fairmont
catv.
nor
did
the
court
discuss
the
devices
which
connected
the
antenna
to
the
catv
distribution
system.
there
was
in
fortnightly
a
issue
as
to
the
technology
of
the
equipment,
cables,
amplifiers
and
other
equipment
to
bring
the
signal
from
the
antenna
to
the
subscriber
sets.
united
artists,
the
copyright
owner
there
argued
that
--
and
cbs
repeats
the
argument
here,
that
the
catv
systems
have
complicated
equipment,
sophisticated
equipment
and
that
they
are
active
rather
than
passive
and
that
the
transmission
and
retransmission
of
the
broadcast
signals
by
the
catv
systems,
in
the
course
of
distributing
the
signals
to
the
subscribers
constitutes
a
performance.
there
was
also
in
fortnightly
issues
to
whether
the
catv
systems
spoiled
the
market
for
the
copyright
owners
by
making
a
broadcast
available
in
the
catv
community
outside
the
broadcast
stations
market.
the
trial
court
found
that
the
broadcast
could
not
be
received
by
the
residents
of
clarksburg
and
fairmont
on
their
own
antennas.
the
catv
reception,
the
copyright
owner
argued,
spoiled
his
market.
the
fortnightly
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
copyright
owner
was
entitled
to
prevent
delusion
of
his
market
and
to
limit
his
license
to
areas
and
to
audiences.
this
court
rejected
arguments
based
on
the
technology
of
equipment
and
by
the
court
of
appeals
--
and
the
arguments
by
the
cat
--
of
the
copyright
owner
that
his
market
had
been
spoiled.
it
focused
on
the
meaning
of
the
word
performance
and
held
that
reception
of
a
broadcast
intended
for
public
reception
and
the
distribution
of
the
broadcast
signals
to
the
--
what
this
court
called
additional
viewers
was
not
a
performance.
despite
this
background,
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
concluded
that
the
location
of
the
antenna
on
which
the
broadcast
was
received
and
the
technology
of
the
equipment
to
connect
the
antenna
to
the
cable
distribution
system
had
copyright
significance.
the
error,
we
submit
in
the
decision
of
the
court
below
stems
from
the
fact
that
the
court
based
its
reasoning
here
as
it
did
in
fortnightly
on
what
the
copyright
owner
said
was
his
preferred
method
of
economics
in
exploiting
his
copyright
rather
than
on
the
meaning
of
the
word
performance.
cbs
and
the
copyright
amici
in
the
court
below
argued
that
the
television
station
has
a
specific
market
area
bounded
by
the
points
for
the
broadcast
to
receive
off
the
air
by
rooftop
antennas.
a
copyrighted
owner,
it
is
said,
does
not
intend
his
broadcast
to
be
viewed
outside
that
area
and
it
was
viewed
outside
that
area
by
reason
of
the
catv
reception
is
--
it
is
as
cbs
says
as
an
importation
of
a
distant
signal
which
is
according
to
cbs,
a
broadcast
function.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that’s
correct.
all
of
this
is
an
echo
of
the
copyright
owners’
economic
argument.
building
on
this
copyright
owners’
preferred
economics,
the
court
below
concluded
that
the
catv
perception
would
be
permitted
only
if
the
broadcast
signal
was
in
the
court’s
words,
“in
the
community.”
but
the
signal
was
not
already
in
the
community,
than
it
was
a
distant
signal
and
importing
it
into
the
catv
community
made
the
catv
functionally
equivalent
to
a
broadcaster
and
the
court
deemed
that
to
be
an
infringement.
the
court
recognized
the
difficult
task
of
defining
the
term
distant
signal.
it
could
not
use
rooftop
antennas
as
the
cbs
had
suggested.
such
a
conclusion,
the
court
said,
“it
would
fly
in
the
face
of
the
mandate
of
fortnightly.”
it
could
not
require
that
the
receiving
antenna
be
located
in
the
catv
community.
the
catv
receiving
antennas
in
fortnightly
were
located
outside,
all
seven
of
the
catv
communities
although
the
exact
distance
did
not
figure
in
any
way
in
the
decision
in
fortnightly.
in
the
end,
the
court
below
devised
the
definition
based
on
antenna
technology
using
such
vague
litigation
prone
words
as
near
or
adjacent
to.
when
the
antenna
is
not
near
or
adjacent
to
the
catv
community
and
what
the
court
called,
transmittal
or
re-transmittal
devices
were
needed
to
bring
the
signal
form
the
antenna
to
the
catv
community,
then
it
is
a
distant
signal.
unless
the
catv
can
bear
what
it
called
the
heavy
burden
of
showing
that
the
signal
could
be
received
near
or
adjacent
to
the
catv
community
on
an
antenna
of
equivalence
sophistication,
another
litigation
prone
test.
the
transmittal
or
re-transmittal
device
that
the
court
talked
about
in
its
formulation
included
either
microwave
or
cable.
in
the
courts
below,
cbs
argued
that
because
microwave
is
transmission
through
the
air,
its
use
makes
catv
like
a
broadcaster
who
also
transmits
through
the
air.
but
both
courts
below
held
that
microwave
is
point
to
point
transmission
equivalent
to
or
a
substitute
for
cable
or
wire.
and
that
issue
of
microwave
is
not
in
the
petition
here.
nonetheless,
the
court
below
made
the
use
of
the
transmittal
device,
such
as
microwave
or
cable
critical
overlooking
the
fact
that
a
transmittal
device
was
in
fact
used
in
fortnightly
cables
and
amplifier
to
bring
the
signal
from
the
antenna
to
the
community.
in
support
for
this
new
judicial
formulation,
the
court
below
and
cbs
here
placed
central
reliance
on
two
sentences
in
this
courts
opinion,
united
states
v.
southwestern
cable.
that
case
involved
the
fcc’s
rule
under
the
communications
act
requiring
that
catv
systems
in
the
grade
b
contour
of
a
station
received
the
station
and
block
out
other
signals,
so-called
non-duplication
of
the
same
program.
and
upholding
the
fcc’s
regulatory
authority,
this
court
described
catv
systems
as
having
one
or
both
of
two
functions.
first,
enhancing
reception
of
local
stations
and
second,
transmitting
to
subscribers
the
signals
of
stations
beyond
the
reach
of
local
antennae
which
this
court
referred
as
the
importation
of
distant
signals.
this
was
said
in
a
regulatory
context,
not
copyright.
and
this
court
specifically
noted
that
the
term
“distant
signal”
was
given
a
specialized
definition
by
the
fcc
in
the
context
of
the
compulsory
carriage
rule.
distance
meant,
received
beyond
the
grade
b
contour
of
a
station
aligned,
calculated
on
an
engineering
assumption
along
which
good
reception
is
expected
90%
of
the
time
at
50%
of
the
locations.
it
does
not
mark
the
limits
of
actual
reception.
the
court
below
recognized
that
this
fcc
definition
of
distant
signals
for
regulatory
purposes
was
in
its
words
“unsuitable
for
copyright
purposes.”
five
of
the
ten
stations
received
in
--
by
the
fortnightly
catv’s
were
distant
under
the
fcc
rule
beyond
the
b
contour.
this
is
significant
because
fortnightly
and
southwestern
were
argued
together
and
decided
at
virtually
the
same
time.
if
the
fcc
definition
of
distant
signals
had
copyright
significance,
this
court
would
surely
had
said
so.
instead,
it
held
that
the
reception
of
signals,
both
distant
and
non-distant
under
the
fcc
definition
was
not
a
performance.
while
the
court
below
uses
the
word
distant
signal,
the
rule
that
constructed
is
not
based
on
distance
nor
in
the
fcc
definition.
in
fact,
it
conflicts
directly
with
the
fcc
definition.
the
durango
station
received
by
the
catv
in
farmington
which
the
court
below
held
was
distant,
is
only
in
fact
45
miles
from
farmington.
in
fortnightly,
the
pittsburg
stations
were
80
miles
from
the
clarksburg
catv
systems.
a
mountain
blocks
the
reception
of
the
durango
station
in
farmington.
the
catv
receiving
antenna
is
on
the
side,
on
a
maser,
40
miles
away
and
the
signal
is
brought
to
farmington
by
a
microwave
link
licensed
by
the
fcc.
but
farmington
is
within
the
grade
b
contour
of
the
durango
station
and
hence,
it
is
local
under
the
fcc
compulsory
carriage
rule.
the
station
demanded
and
received
compulsory
carriage
and
non-duplication
protection.
under
the
new
definition
of
the
court
below,
the
reception
of
the
durango
station
by
the
farmington
catv
which
is
required
by
the
fcc
has
become
a
performance,
the
consequence
which
cbs
dryly
describes
as
anomalous.
the
court
below
said
without
analysis
that
in
receiving
distant
signals,
as
it
defined
them,
the
catv
was
functionally
equivalent
to
a
broadcaster.
but
it
made
no
attempt
to
compare
the
functions
of
a
catv
system
and
a
broadcaster.
whether
or
not
the
signal
is
distant
under
the
rule
of
the
court
below,
the
catv
had
nothing
to
do
with
procuring
or
originating
the
program,
the
broadcaster
did.
the
catv
system
merely
received
what
was
broadcast
and
made
the
signals
available
instantaneously
and
without
editing
to
its
subscribers.
this
is
exactly
what
the
catv
did
in
fortnightly.
cbs
argues
that
the
catv
selects
stations
to
be
received
for
their
programming
and
hence
selects
programs.
this
is
an
echo
of
the
attempt
made
in
fortnightly
to
confuse
the
selection
of
stations
with
the
selection
of
programs.
in
fortnightly,
the
selection
of
stations
was
held
not
to
be
--
was
held
to
be
on
the
viewer
side
and
not
a
performance.
the
same
conclusion
we
think
should
be
applicable
here.
moreover
the
court
overlooked
the
fact
that
in
law
and
in
the
economics
of
the
television
industry,
the
catv
subscribers
are
in
the
audience
coverage
area
of
the
television
station.
the
fcc
has
authority
under
its
statute
to
fix
the
“areas
or
zones
to
be
served
by
a
station.”
it
has
done
this
by
its
general
rules
permitting
catv
reception
of
stations
including
the
so-called
distant
signals.
but
in
this
instance,
the
fcc
has
acted
more
specifically.
it
has
granted
microwave
licenses
to
receive
these
specific
stations,
by
these
specific
catv’s
to
distribute
the
signals
in
this
catv
community.
this
is
a
specific
act
by
the
commission
exercising
its
authority
to
put
the
catv
subscribers
in
the
zone
or
area
to
be
served
by
the
station.
in
addition,
in
television
industry
economics,
the
catv
subscribers
are
included
in
the
stations
coverage
area.
television
is
a
mass
medium
and
its
economics
turned
on
audience
size.
the
selection
of
affiliates,
the
prices
paid
for
to
charge
the
advertisers
the
prices
paid
for
programs
all
turn
on
the
size
of
the
audience.
the
audience
is
measured
by
the
rating
services,
arb
and
nielsen
are
the
two
big
ones
and
this
service
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
mr.
justice
white,
an
advertiser
will
have
to
compete
for
television
time
against
other
advertisers
who
want
that
television
time.
the
station’s
rates
are
geared
to
the
size
of
the
station’s
audience.
if
he
wants
to
use
the
station,
then
he
has
to
pay
the
station’s
rates
which
are
tied
directly
into
the
stations
audience.
he
may
not
want
to
have
his
program
or
advertisements
seen
by
somebody
in
phoenix
or
he
may
not
want
to
have
it
seen
by
juveniles
or
he
may
not
want
to
have
it
seen
by
women,
but
he
pays
for
them
because
they’re
in
the
stations
audience.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
the
rates
charge
the
advertisers,
the
price
is
paid
for
programs.
the
cost
of
living
console
and
the
orders
which
it
issued
about
this
industry
has
said
that
both
the
rates
charged
advertisers
and
prices
paid
for
programs
are
not
tied
to
costs,
but
to
the
size
of
the
audiences
measured
by
the
rating
services.
and
the
significant
thing
your
honor
is
that
the
distant
station
here
that
cbs
talks
most
about,
los
angeles
to
farmington
is
--
has
the
farmington
catv
subscribers
included
in
its
coverage
area
in
the
--
and
it's
published
in
the
volumes,
as
they
are
published
to
shows
--
what
the
coverage
area
is.
and
the
record
has
got
a
number
of
proposals
by
the
stations
citing
in
catv
coverage
including
that
of
a
los
angeles
station
which
talks
about
its
catv
coverage
in
the
new
mexico.
when
cbs
decided
to
use
television
to
exploit
its
works,
it
took
the
medium
the
way
it
is,
in
fact
and
in
the
law.
when
cbs
authorized
the
broadcast,
it
was
broadcast
under
the
words
of
the
statute
intended
to
be
received
by
the
public.
the
statute
says,
“the
public,”
not
just
the
part
of
the
public,
cbs
would
like
for
its
own
private
reasons
to
be
allowed
to
receive
the
broadcast,
and
in
the
industry
economics,
the
subscribers
were
in
the
stations
coverage
area.
i
now
turn
to
the
issue
raised
by
the
cross-petition.
whether
the
activity
of
catv
system
on
separate
not
used
for
broadcast
perception
so
tainted
the
reception
of
the
broadcast
as
to
convert
that
reception
into
a
performance
put
in
another
way
as
there
are
doctrine
of
infringement
by
analogy
or
in
the
words
of
the
court
below,
is
there
a
spillover
effect?
when
a
catv
originates
the
program
and
makes
it
available
to
subscribers,
it
performs
the
program.
if
copyrights
were
involved,
teleprompter
secured
a
license
and
paid
a
royalty.
no
cbs
program
was
involved
in
any
catv
origination.
this
is
not
pay
tv,
no
extra
or
separate
charge
was
made
for
the
originated
program.
the
origination
by
the
catv
was
on
separate
non-broadcast
channels
and
in
no
way
interfered
with
or
interrupted
the
reception
of
the
broadcast.
there
were
two
kinds
of
programming,
the
so-called
automated
programming
in
which
cameras,
scans,
clock
and
weather
instruments
and
the
sort
of
general
interest
programming.
the
idea
of
originating
programming
occurred
in
the
early
60’s
because
there
was
an
empty
channel
not
used
for
broadcast
reception
in
the
farmington
system.
and
they’ve
conceived
the
notion
of
originating
with
the
idea
of
attracting
people
to
use
the
catv
service.
it
worked
and
in
the
relevant
periods
in
this
case,
three
of
the
five
system
had
general
interest
programming
and
automated
programming,
farmington,
great
falls
and
new
york.
the
amount
varied,
great
falls
had
two
hours
a
day,
five
days
a
week,
and
up
to
in
new
york,
1971,
10
hours
a
day.
now
the
interconnection
that
justice
stewart
mentioned
is
actually
a
form
of
origination.
it
was
closed
circuit
rights
to
the
(inaudible)
the
systems
got
in
1964
and
1965.
three
other
systems
here
carried
those
fights.
no
extra
charge
was
made
for
that.
but
with
reference
to
--
i
should
say
that
all
of
this
catv
origination
was
in
conformity
with
the
fcc
rules
and
there
was
one
sale
of
commercials
that
occurred
in
1971
in
new
york,
the
new
york
catv,
that
also
was
in
conformity
with
the
fcc
rules.
cbs
has
proposed
a
doctrine
of
totality
by
which
a
reception
service
can
be
converted
from
a
non-performance
into
a
performance.
because
the
broadcaster
originates
programs,
sells,
commercials,
is
interconnected
in
networks,
the
catv,
it
is
said
which
performs
these
functions
is
equivalent
to
a
broadcaster
and
its
entire
reception
service
thereby
becomes
a
performance.
but
the
catv
systems
performed
none
other
broadcaster
functions
that
cbs
talks
about
with
reference
to
the
broadcast
works.
cbs
also
speaks
about
receiving
distant
signals
by
broadcasting
stations.
but
here
also,
the
analogy
is
based
on
a
confusion.
a
distant
signal
in
this
context
means
that
a
broadcasting
station
got
its
program
from
a
distant
source,
i.e.
a
network.
but
the
broadcaster
remained
responsible
as
the
originator
of
the
program
and
he
performed
it
when
he
broadcast
it.
moreover,
there's
no
totality
here.
two
other
systems,
rawlins
and
elmira
had
only
these
automated
programming
devices,
time
and
weather
scan.
new
york
did
not
receive
distant
signals.
its
franchise
required
it
to
receive
only
local
new
york
stations.
only
one
system
sold
commercials
on
originations
in
new
york.
two
events
of
interconnection
that
are
talked
about
occurred
in
1964
and
1965,
months
away
or
years
away
from
the
dates
of
the
alleged
infringements.
the
courts
below
we
submit
were
correct
in
holding
that
there
is
no
spillover
effect
and
that
there
is
no
doctrine
of
totality
by
analogy.
in
conclusion,
the
fcc’s
regulatory
plan
perhaps
for
catv
was
designed
among
other
things
to
provide
television
service
to
households
in
small
communities.
that
is
like
the
service
otherwise
only
residents
in
large
metropolitan
areas
are
able
to
get.
more
than
2
million
households
now
depend
on
catv
reception
of
distant
signals
for
part
of
their
television
service.
by
emphasizing
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
think
there
is
no
significance
for
distant
signals
in
the
copyright
context.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i’m
using
the
phrase
that
i
used
distant
signals
in
the
context
of
the
court
below.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that’s
correct
your
honor.
but
that
may
have
significance
in
the
regulatory
context
but
it
seems
to
me
it
has
no
significance
in
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
--
copyright
context.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
in
addition,
the
fcc
in
that
instance,
kttv
granted
the
license
which
put
the
catv
subscribers
in

mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes.
there
are

mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
think
its

mr.
robert

barnard
its

think
the

but
a

--
i
think
the
air

are
about
900

mr.
robert
c.
barnard
by
emphasizing
a
perspective
ruling
only
and
by
offering
to
waive
damages,
cbs
is
really
asking
this
court
to
turn
its
back
on
the
fortnightly,
overruling
or
restricting
cbs,
restricting
fortnightly,
cbs
asks,
will
place
in
the

of

cbs
the
power

catv
plan
aside
and
to
decide
in
their
own
private
interest
what
television
service,
the
public
in
the
united
states
should
receive.
i’d
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
your
honor
i
don’t
think
i
can
make
a
forward
course,
i
believe
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
thank
you.
i
don’t
believe
that
--
i
believe
that
a
statute
has
been
reported
out
by
a
senate
subcommittee
and
there's
pending
action
on
the
senate
side.
there
have
been,
i
believe
hearings
on
both
sides
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
as
i
understand
it
sir,
it's
been
reported
out
by
a
subcommittee
to
the
full
committee.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
its
got
a
fairly
complicated
set
of
rules
that
have
among
other
things
compulsory
licenses.
they
have
provisions
for
payments,
they
have
a
whole
set
of
standards
as
to
which
catv
systems
would
--
as
would
apply
to.
i
say
to
the
court
these
in
very
general
terms
because
i
am
not
involved
in
the
legislative
fight
and
i
know
it
only
incidentally.
but
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
what
mr.
graubard
has
said
and
what
cbs
has
also
intimated
as
well
as
one
of
the
other
amici
that
the
court
should
decide
against
catv
to
motivate
the
situations
so
that
there's
legislation
hardly
places
the
proper
emphasis
on
the
issue
in
front
of
this
court,
the
issue
in
front
of
this
court
is
not
to
motivate
legislations
to
decide
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
performance
and
a
statute
which
is
in
front
of
the
court.
may
i
comment
on
one
or
two
of
the
points
that
mr.
sokolow
made
in
the
course
of
his
argument.
he
talked
about
how
much
origination
catv
does
and
compared
the
origination
by
the
new
york
catv
with
wcbs
in
new
york.
in
fact,
wcbs
new
york
under
the
rules
originates
everything
it
broadcasts,
whether
it
gets
it
from
the
network
or
not.
it
is
the
responsible
broadcaster
and
a
responsible
originator.
mr.
sokolow
said
that
we
transmit
this.
we
are
engaged
in
transmission
and
retransmission.
we
are
in
engaged
in
handling
electromagnetic
energy.
we
do
not
handle
the
sight
or
sounds
of
the
programs
in
any
way.
we
received
a
signal,
we
deliver
the
signal
to
our
subscribers
homes.
if
he
chooses
to
view
the
program,
he
turns
on
a
set,
if
he
doesn’t,
he
doesn’t.
otherwise
there
is
no
sight
or
sound
involved
in
this.
mr.
sokolow
talked
about
whether
we
were
active
or
passive.
this
court
in
fortnightly
said
that
the
catv
systems
were
active.
they
were
active
on
the
side
of
the
viewer.
he
said
that
in
fortnightly,
it
was
intended
that
this
programs
be
viewed
by
the
broadcast
by
the
pittsburg
stations,
be
viewed
in
clarksburg
and
fairmont.
the
court
of
appeals
here
said,
“they
recognized
that
the
programs
would
not
have
been
viewed
in
clarksburg
and
fairmont
but
for
the
catv.
and
the
clarksburg
--
in
the
fortnightly,
the
copyright
owner
made
exactly
the
same
argument
as
made
here
that
his
market
in
clarksburg
where
there
was
a
television
station
was
being
disturbed
by
the
reception
of
the
catv
programs.
in
fortnightly,
we
urged
that
the
catv
subscribers
were
in
the
coverage
area
of
the
stations.
i
think
that
our
subscribers
now
are
in
the
coverage
area
of
the
stations.
they're
in
the
area
--
coverage
area
of
the
stations
by
the
industry’s
economics
and
by
the
action
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
and
in
the
industry’s
economics
were
taken
into
account
as
part
of
the
stations
audience
which
it
uses
as
a
basis
for
its
rates
and
the
--
that
the
prices
which
are
paid
for
its
program,
he
said
that
the
los
angeles
station
does
not
intend
that
it
signal
be
received
in
farmington
but
in
fact
it
exploits
that
fact
by
putting
out
sales
--
you're
saying
that
you
can
get
reception
in
new
mexico
by
subscribing
to
the
system,
--
in
the
record
there
is
a
sales
brochure
from
one
of
the
stations.
the
same
is
true
of
the
great
falls.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
a
station
in
los
angeles.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
no.
a
station
in
los
angeles
trying
to
sell
advertisers,
put
out
a
sales
brochure
in
which
it
brags
about
its
catv
coverage
including
the
coverage
in
new
mexico.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
we
advertise
what
we
provide
to
our
subscribers.
whatever
it
is
we
provide
(voice

--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
and
there
maybe
some
advertisers
that
don’t
want
that
but
he
has
to
compete
with
advertisers
that
do
want
that
because
that’s
the
basis
for
which
this
--
there's
probably

mr.

may

complaint

not
--
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
antenna
location
and
the
connection
to

significance.
second,
the
conditional
cross-petition
raises
the
issue
whether
the
reception
of
a
broadcast
by
a
catv
system
is
converted
into
a
performance
of
the
broadcast
work
not
by
what
the
catv
system
did
with
reference
to
the
broadcast
copyrighted
work
but
by
reason
of
what
the
catv
system
did
on
separate
channels
not
used
to
receive
broadcasts
and
not
involving
cbs’s
copyrights.
both
courts
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
the
issue
of
microwave
is
not
up
in
this
petition.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
and
the
sale
of
commercial.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
both
courts
below
held
that
those
three
activities
did
not
have
a
spillover
effect
on
the
reception
service
and
held
that
it
did
not
change
it
into
a
performance.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
turn
first
to
the
leading
question
of
the
distant
signal
issue.
fortnightly
as
the
court
will
recall
involve
two
catv
systems
in
west
virginia,
one
in
clarksburg,
one
in
fairmont
which
received
pittsburg
and
other
stations
60
to
80
miles
away.
in
fortnightly
the
issue
was
whether
the
reception
of
--
by
the
two
catv
systems
was
a
performance
and
hence
an
infringement.
in
holding
that
this
--
that
the
reception
service
by
those
two
catv
systems
was
not
a
performance,
this
court
did
not
discuss
the
receiving
antenna
or
its
location
in
relationship
to
the
catv
communities
which
had
granted
a
franchise
to
the
fortnightly
catv’s.
there
were
actually
five
towns
that
had
granted
franchises
to
the
clarksburg
catv
and
two
to
the
fairmont
catv.
nor
did
the
court
discuss
the
devices
which
connected
the
antenna
to
the
catv
distribution
system.
there
was
in
fortnightly
a
issue
as
to
the
technology
of
the
equipment,
cables,
amplifiers
and
other
equipment
to
bring
the
signal
from
the
antenna
to
the
subscriber
sets.
united
artists,
the
copyright
owner
there
argued
that
--
and
cbs
repeats
the
argument
here,
that
the
catv
systems
have
complicated
equipment,
sophisticated
equipment
and
that
they
are
active
rather
than
passive
and
that
the
transmission
and
retransmission
of
the
broadcast
signals
by
the
catv
systems,
in
the
course
of
distributing
the
signals
to
the
subscribers
constitutes
a
performance.
there
was
also
in
fortnightly
issues
to
whether
the
catv
systems
spoiled
the
market
for
the
copyright
owners
by
making
a
broadcast
available
in
the
catv
community
outside
the
broadcast
stations
market.
the
trial
court
found
that
the
broadcast
could
not
be
received
by
the
residents
of
clarksburg
and
fairmont
on
their
own
antennas.
the
catv
reception,
the
copyright
owner
argued,
spoiled
his
market.
the
fortnightly
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
copyright
owner
was
entitled
to
prevent
delusion
of
his
market
and
to
limit
his
license
to
areas
and
to
audiences.
this
court
rejected
arguments
based
on
the
technology
of
equipment
and
by
the
court
of
appeals
--
and
the
arguments
by
the
cat
--
of
the
copyright
owner
that
his
market
had
been
spoiled.
it
focused
on
the
meaning
of
the
word
performance
and
held
that
reception
of
a
broadcast
intended
for
public
reception
and
the
distribution
of
the
broadcast
signals
to
the
--
what
this
court
called
additional
viewers
was
not
a
performance.
despite
this
background,
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
concluded
that
the
location
of
the
antenna
on
which
the
broadcast
was
received
and
the
technology
of
the
equipment
to
connect
the
antenna
to
the
cable
distribution
system
had
copyright
significance.
the
error,
we
submit
in
the
decision
of
the
court
below
stems
from
the
fact
that
the
court
based
its
reasoning
here
as
it
did
in
fortnightly
on
what
the
copyright
owner
said
was
his
preferred
method
of
economics
in
exploiting
his
copyright
rather
than
on
the
meaning
of
the
word
performance.
cbs
and
the
copyright
amici
in
the
court
below
argued
that
the
television
station
has
a
specific
market
area
bounded
by
the
points
for
the
broadcast
to
receive
off
the
air
by
rooftop
antennas.
a
copyrighted
owner,
it
is
said,
does
not
intend
his
broadcast
to
be
viewed
outside
that
area
and
it
was
viewed
outside
that
area
by
reason
of
the
catv
reception
is
--
it
is
as
cbs
says
as
an
importation
of
a
distant
signal
which
is
according
to
cbs,
a
broadcast
function.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that’s
correct.
all
of
this
is
an
echo
of
the
copyright
owners’
economic
argument.
building
on
this
copyright
owners’
preferred
economics,
the
court
below
concluded
that
the
catv
perception
would
be
permitted
only
if
the
broadcast
signal
was
in
the
court’s
words,
“in
the
community.”
but
the
signal
was
not
already
in
the
community,
than
it
was
a
distant
signal
and
importing
it
into
the
catv
community
made
the
catv
functionally
equivalent
to
a
broadcaster
and
the
court
deemed
that
to
be
an
infringement.
the
court
recognized
the
difficult
task
of
defining
the
term
distant
signal.
it
could
not
use
rooftop
antennas
as
the
cbs
had
suggested.
such
a
conclusion,
the
court
said,
“it
would
fly
in
the
face
of
the
mandate
of
fortnightly.”
it
could
not
require
that
the
receiving
antenna
be
located
in
the
catv
community.
the
catv
receiving
antennas
in
fortnightly
were
located
outside,
all
seven
of
the
catv
communities
although
the
exact
distance
did
not
figure
in
any
way
in
the
decision
in
fortnightly.
in
the
end,
the
court
below
devised
the
definition
based
on
antenna
technology
using
such
vague
litigation
prone
words
as
near
or
adjacent
to.
when
the
antenna
is
not
near
or
adjacent
to
the
catv
community
and
what
the
court
called,
transmittal
or
re-transmittal
devices
were
needed
to
bring
the
signal
form
the
antenna
to
the
catv
community,
then
it
is
a
distant
signal.
unless
the
catv
can
bear
what
it
called
the
heavy
burden
of
showing
that
the
signal
could
be
received
near
or
adjacent
to
the
catv
community
on
an
antenna
of
equivalence
sophistication,
another
litigation
prone
test.
the
transmittal
or
re-transmittal
device
that
the
court
talked
about
in
its
formulation
included
either
microwave
or
cable.
in
the
courts
below,
cbs
argued
that
because
microwave
is
transmission
through
the
air,
its
use
makes
catv
like
a
broadcaster
who
also
transmits
through
the
air.
but
both
courts
below
held
that
microwave
is
point
to
point
transmission
equivalent
to
or
a
substitute
for
cable
or
wire.
and
that
issue
of
microwave
is
not
in
the
petition
here.
nonetheless,
the
court
below
made
the
use
of
the
transmittal
device,
such
as
microwave
or
cable
critical
overlooking
the
fact
that
a
transmittal
device
was
in
fact
used
in
fortnightly
cables
and
amplifier
to
bring
the
signal
from
the
antenna
to
the
community.
in
support
for
this
new
judicial
formulation,
the
court
below
and
cbs
here
placed
central
reliance
on
two
sentences
in
this
courts
opinion,
united
states
v.
southwestern
cable.
that
case
involved
the
fcc’s
rule
under
the
communications
act
requiring
that
catv
systems
in
the
grade
b
contour
of
a
station
received
the
station
and
block
out
other
signals,
so-called
non-duplication
of
the
same
program.
and
upholding
the
fcc’s
regulatory
authority,
this
court
described
catv
systems
as
having
one
or
both
of
two
functions.
first,
enhancing
reception
of
local
stations
and
second,
transmitting
to
subscribers
the
signals
of
stations
beyond
the
reach
of
local
antennae
which
this
court
referred
as
the
importation
of
distant
signals.
this
was
said
in
a
regulatory
context,
not
copyright.
and
this
court
specifically
noted
that
the
term
“distant
signal”
was
given
a
specialized
definition
by
the
fcc
in
the
context
of
the
compulsory
carriage
rule.
distance
meant,
received
beyond
the
grade
b
contour
of
a
station
aligned,
calculated
on
an
engineering
assumption
along
which
good
reception
is
expected
90%
of
the
time
at
50%
of
the
locations.
it
does
not
mark
the
limits
of
actual
reception.
the
court
below
recognized
that
this
fcc
definition
of
distant
signals
for
regulatory
purposes
was
in
its
words
“unsuitable
for
copyright
purposes.”
five
of
the
ten
stations
received
in
--
by
the
fortnightly
catv’s
were
distant
under
the
fcc
rule
beyond
the
b
contour.
this
is
significant
because
fortnightly
and
southwestern
were
argued
together
and
decided
at
virtually
the
same
time.
if
the
fcc
definition
of
distant
signals
had
copyright
significance,
this
court
would
surely
had
said
so.
instead,
it
held
that
the
reception
of
signals,
both
distant
and
non-distant
under
the
fcc
definition
was
not
a
performance.
while
the
court
below
uses
the
word
distant
signal,
the
rule
that
constructed
is
not
based
on
distance
nor
in
the
fcc
definition.
in
fact,
it
conflicts
directly
with
the
fcc
definition.
the
durango
station
received
by
the
catv
in
farmington
which
the
court
below
held
was
distant,
is
only
in
fact
45
miles
from
farmington.
in
fortnightly,
the
pittsburg
stations
were
80
miles
from
the
clarksburg
catv
systems.
a
mountain
blocks
the
reception
of
the
durango
station
in
farmington.
the
catv
receiving
antenna
is
on
the
side,
on
a
maser,
40
miles
away
and
the
signal
is
brought
to
farmington
by
a
microwave
link
licensed
by
the
fcc.
but
farmington
is
within
the
grade
b
contour
of
the
durango
station
and
hence,
it
is
local
under
the
fcc
compulsory
carriage
rule.
the
station
demanded
and
received
compulsory
carriage
and
non-duplication
protection.
under
the
new
definition
of
the
court
below,
the
reception
of
the
durango
station
by
the
farmington
catv
which
is
required
by
the
fcc
has
become
a
performance,
the
consequence
which
cbs
dryly
describes
as
anomalous.
the
court
below
said
without
analysis
that
in
receiving
distant
signals,
as
it
defined
them,
the
catv
was
functionally
equivalent
to
a
broadcaster.
but
it
made
no
attempt
to
compare
the
functions
of
a
catv
system
and
a
broadcaster.
whether
or
not
the
signal
is
distant
under
the
rule
of
the
court
below,
the
catv
had
nothing
to
do
with
procuring
or
originating
the
program,
the
broadcaster
did.
the
catv
system
merely
received
what
was
broadcast
and
made
the
signals
available
instantaneously
and
without
editing
to
its
subscribers.
this
is
exactly
what
the
catv
did
in
fortnightly.
cbs
argues
that
the
catv
selects
stations
to
be
received
for
their
programming
and
hence
selects
programs.
this
is
an
echo
of
the
attempt
made
in
fortnightly
to
confuse
the
selection
of
stations
with
the
selection
of
programs.
in
fortnightly,
the
selection
of
stations
was
held
not
to
be
--
was
held
to
be
on
the
viewer
side
and
not
a
performance.
the
same
conclusion
we
think
should
be
applicable
here.
moreover
the
court
overlooked
the
fact
that
in
law
and
in
the
economics
of
the
television
industry,
the
catv
subscribers
are
in
the
audience
coverage
area
of
the
television
station.
the
fcc
has
authority
under
its
statute
to
fix
the
“areas
or
zones
to
be
served
by
a
station.”
it
has
done
this
by
its
general
rules
permitting
catv
reception
of
stations
including
the
so-called
distant
signals.
but
in
this
instance,
the
fcc
has
acted
more
specifically.
it
has
granted
microwave
licenses
to
receive
these
specific
stations,
by
these
specific
catv’s
to
distribute
the
signals
in
this
catv
community.
this
is
a
specific
act
by
the
commission
exercising
its
authority
to
put
the
catv
subscribers
in
the
zone
or
area
to
be
served
by
the
station.
in
addition,
in
television
industry
economics,
the
catv
subscribers
are
included
in
the
stations
coverage
area.
television
is
a
mass
medium
and
its
economics
turned
on
audience
size.
the
selection
of
affiliates,
the
prices
paid
for
to
charge
the
advertisers
the
prices
paid
for
programs
all
turn
on
the
size
of
the
audience.
the
audience
is
measured
by
the
rating
services,
arb
and
nielsen
are
the
two
big
ones
and
this
service
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
mr.
justice
white,
an
advertiser
will
have
to
compete
for
television
time
against
other
advertisers
who
want
that
television
time.
the
station’s
rates
are
geared
to
the
size
of
the
station’s
audience.
if
he
wants
to
use
the
station,
then
he
has
to
pay
the
station’s
rates
which
are
tied
directly
into
the
stations
audience.
he
may
not
want
to
have
his
program
or
advertisements
seen
by
somebody
in
phoenix
or
he
may
not
want
to
have
it
seen
by
juveniles
or
he
may
not
want
to
have
it
seen
by
women,
but
he
pays
for
them
because
they’re
in
the
stations
audience.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
the
rates
charge
the
advertisers,
the
price
is
paid
for
programs.
the
cost
of
living
console
and
the
orders
which
it
issued
about
this
industry
has
said
that
both
the
rates
charged
advertisers
and
prices
paid
for
programs
are
not
tied
to
costs,
but
to
the
size
of
the
audiences
measured
by
the
rating
services.
and
the
significant
thing
your
honor
is
that
the
distant
station
here
that
cbs
talks
most
about,
los
angeles
to
farmington
is
--
has
the
farmington
catv
subscribers
included
in
its
coverage
area
in
the
--
and
it's
published
in
the
volumes,
as
they
are
published
to
shows
--
what
the
coverage
area
is.
and
the
record
has
got
a
number
of
proposals
by
the
stations
citing
in
catv
coverage
including
that
of
a
los
angeles
station
which
talks
about
its
catv
coverage
in
the
new
mexico.
when
cbs
decided
to
use
television
to
exploit
its
works,
it
took
the
medium
the
way
it
is,
in
fact
and
in
the
law.
when
cbs
authorized
the
broadcast,
it
was
broadcast
under
the
words
of
the
statute
intended
to
be
received
by
the
public.
the
statute
says,
“the
public,”
not
just
the
part
of
the
public,
cbs
would
like
for
its
own
private
reasons
to
be
allowed
to
receive
the
broadcast,
and
in
the
industry
economics,
the
subscribers
were
in
the
stations
coverage
area.
i
now
turn
to
the
issue
raised
by
the
cross-petition.
whether
the
activity
of
catv
system
on
separate
not
used
for
broadcast
perception
so
tainted
the
reception
of
the
broadcast
as
to
convert
that
reception
into
a
performance
put
in
another
way
as
there
are
doctrine
of
infringement
by
analogy
or
in
the
words
of
the
court
below,
is
there
a
spillover
effect?
when
a
catv
originates
the
program
and
makes
it
available
to
subscribers,
it
performs
the
program.
if
copyrights
were
involved,
teleprompter
secured
a
license
and
paid
a
royalty.
no
cbs
program
was
involved
in
any
catv
origination.
this
is
not
pay
tv,
no
extra
or
separate
charge
was
made
for
the
originated
program.
the
origination
by
the
catv
was
on
separate
non-broadcast
channels
and
in
no
way
interfered
with
or
interrupted
the
reception
of
the
broadcast.
there
were
two
kinds
of
programming,
the
so-called
automated
programming
in
which
cameras,
scans,
clock
and
weather
instruments
and
the
sort
of
general
interest
programming.
the
idea
of
originating
programming
occurred
in
the
early
60’s
because
there
was
an
empty
channel
not
used
for
broadcast
reception
in
the
farmington
system.
and
they’ve
conceived
the
notion
of
originating
with
the
idea
of
attracting
people
to
use
the
catv
service.
it
worked
and
in
the
relevant
periods
in
this
case,
three
of
the
five
system
had
general
interest
programming
and
automated
programming,
farmington,
great
falls
and
new
york.
the
amount
varied,
great
falls
had
two
hours
a
day,
five
days
a
week,
and
up
to
in
new
york,
1971,
10
hours
a
day.
now
the
interconnection
that
justice
stewart
mentioned
is
actually
a
form
of
origination.
it
was
closed
circuit
rights
to
the
(inaudible)
the
systems
got
in
1964
and
1965.
three
other
systems
here
carried
those
fights.
no
extra
charge
was
made
for
that.
but
with
reference
to
--
i
should
say
that
all
of
this
catv
origination
was
in
conformity
with
the
fcc
rules
and
there
was
one
sale
of
commercials
that
occurred
in
1971
in
new
york,
the
new
york
catv,
that
also
was
in
conformity
with
the
fcc
rules.
cbs
has
proposed
a
doctrine
of
totality
by
which
a
reception
service
can
be
converted
from
a
non-performance
into
a
performance.
because
the
broadcaster
originates
programs,
sells,
commercials,
is
interconnected
in
networks,
the
catv,
it
is
said
which
performs
these
functions
is
equivalent
to
a
broadcaster
and
its
entire
reception
service
thereby
becomes
a
performance.
but
the
catv
systems
performed
none
other
broadcaster
functions
that
cbs
talks
about
with
reference
to
the
broadcast
works.
cbs
also
speaks
about
receiving
distant
signals
by
broadcasting
stations.
but
here
also,
the
analogy
is
based
on
a
confusion.
a
distant
signal
in
this
context
means
that
a
broadcasting
station
got
its
program
from
a
distant
source,
i.e.
a
network.
but
the
broadcaster
remained
responsible
as
the
originator
of
the
program
and
he
performed
it
when
he
broadcast
it.
moreover,
there's
no
totality
here.
two
other
systems,
rawlins
and
elmira
had
only
these
automated
programming
devices,
time
and
weather
scan.
new
york
did
not
receive
distant
signals.
its
franchise
required
it
to
receive
only
local
new
york
stations.
only
one
system
sold
commercials
on
originations
in
new
york.
two
events
of
interconnection
that
are
talked
about
occurred
in
1964
and
1965,
months
away
or
years
away
from
the
dates
of
the
alleged
infringements.
the
courts
below
we
submit
were
correct
in
holding
that
there
is
no
spillover
effect
and
that
there
is
no
doctrine
of
totality
by
analogy.
in
conclusion,
the
fcc’s
regulatory
plan
perhaps
for
catv
was
designed
among
other
things
to
provide
television
service
to
households
in
small
communities.
that
is
like
the
service
otherwise
only
residents
in
large
metropolitan
areas
are
able
to
get.
more
than
2
million
households
now
depend
on
catv
reception
of
distant
signals
for
part
of
their
television
service.
by
emphasizing
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
think
there
is
no
significance
for
distant
signals
in
the
copyright
context.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i’m
using
the
phrase
that
i
used
distant
signals
in
the
context
of
the
court
below.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that’s
correct
your
honor.
but
that
may
have
significance
in
the
regulatory
context
but
it
seems
to
me
it
has
no
significance
in
the
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
--
copyright
context.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
in
addition,
the
fcc
in
that
instance,
kttv
granted
the
license
which
put
the
catv
subscribers
in
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes.
there
are
four.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
i
think
its
about
900
miles
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
its
about
900
miles
from
--
i
think
the
microwave
network
was
a
little

i
think
the

miles
are
about

mr.
robert
c.
barnard
by
emphasizing
a
perspective
ruling
only
and
by
offering
to
waive
damages,
cbs
is
really
asking
this
court
to
turn
its
back
on
the
fortnightly,
overruling
or
restricting
cbs,
restricting
fortnightly,
cbs
asks,
will
place
in
the
hands
of
a
large
copyright
owners
like
cbs
the
power
to
set
the
fcc,
catv
plan
aside
and
to
decide
in
their
own
private
interest
what
television
service,
the
public
in
the
united
states
should
receive.
i’d
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
your
honor
i
don’t
think
i
can
make
a
forward
course,
i
believe
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
thank
you.
i
don’t
believe
that
--
i
believe
that
a
statute
has
been
reported
out
by
a
senate
subcommittee
and
there's
pending
action
on
the
senate
side.
there
have
been,
i
believe
hearings
on
both
sides
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
as
i
understand
it
sir,
it's
been
reported
out
by
a
subcommittee
to
the
full
committee.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
its
got
a
fairly
complicated
set
of
rules
that
have
among
other
things
compulsory
licenses.
they
have
provisions
for
payments,
they
have
a
whole
set
of
standards
as
to
which
catv
systems
would
--
as
would
apply
to.
i
say
to
the
court
these
in
very
general
terms
because
i
am
not
involved
in
the
legislative
fight
and
i
know
it
only
incidentally.
but
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
what
mr.
graubard
has
said
and
what
cbs
has
also
intimated
as
well
as
one
of
the
other
amici
that
the
court
should
decide
against
catv
to
motivate
the
situations
so
that
there's
legislation
hardly
places
the
proper
emphasis
on
the
issue
in
front
of
this
court,
the
issue
in
front
of
this
court
is
not
to
motivate
legislations
to
decide
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
performance
and
a
statute
which
is
in
front
of
the
court.
may
i
comment
on
one
or
two
of
the
points
that
mr.
sokolow
made
in
the
course
of
his
argument.
he
talked
about
how
much
origination
catv
does
and
compared
the
origination
by
the
new
york
catv
with
wcbs
in
new
york.
in
fact,
wcbs
new
york
under
the
rules
originates
everything
it
broadcasts,
whether
it
gets
it
from
the
network
or
not.
it
is
the
responsible
broadcaster
and
a
responsible
originator.
mr.
sokolow
said
that
we
transmit
this.
we
are
engaged
in
transmission
and
retransmission.
we
are
in
engaged
in
handling
electromagnetic
energy.
we
do
not
handle
the
sight
or
sounds
of
the
programs
in
any
way.
we
received
a
signal,
we
deliver
the
signal
to
our
subscribers
homes.
if
he
chooses
to
view
the
program,
he
turns
on
a
set,
if
he
doesn’t,
he
doesn’t.
otherwise
there
is
no
sight
or
sound
involved
in
this.
mr.
sokolow
talked
about
whether
we
were
active
or
passive.
this
court
in
fortnightly
said
that
the
catv
systems
were
active.
they
were
active
on
the
side
of
the
viewer.
he
said
that
in
fortnightly,
it
was
intended
that
this
programs
be
viewed
by
the
broadcast
by
the
pittsburg
stations,
be
viewed
in
clarksburg
and
fairmont.
the
court
of
appeals
here
said,
“they
recognized
that
the
programs
would
not
have
been
viewed
in
clarksburg
and
fairmont
but
for
the
catv.
and
the
clarksburg
--
in
the
fortnightly,
the
copyright
owner
made
exactly
the
same
argument
as
made
here
that
his
market
in
clarksburg
where
there
was
a
television
station
was
being
disturbed
by
the
reception
of
the
catv
programs.
in
fortnightly,
we
urged
that
the
catv
subscribers
were
in
the
coverage
area
of
the
stations.
i
think
that
our
subscribers
now
are
in
the
coverage
area
of
the
stations.
they're
in
the
area
--
coverage
area
of
the
stations
by
the
industry’s
economics
and
by
the
action
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
and
in
the
industry’s
economics
were
taken
into
account
as
part
of
the
stations
audience
which
it
uses
as
a
basis
for
its
rates
and
the
--
that
the
prices
which
are
paid
for
its
program,
he
said
that
the
los
angeles
station
does
not
intend
that
it
signal
be
received
in
farmington
but
in
fact
it
exploits
that
fact
by
putting
out
sales
--
you're
saying
that
you
can
get
reception
in
new
mexico
by
subscribing
to
the
system,
--
in
the
record
there
is
a
sales
brochure
from
one
of
the
stations.
the
same
is
true
of
the
great
falls.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
a
station
in
los
angeles.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
no.
a
station
in
los
angeles
trying
to
sell
advertisers,
put
out
a
sales
brochure
in
which
it
brags
about
its
catv
coverage
including
the
coverage
in
new
mexico.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
yes.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
we
advertise
what
we
provide
to
our
subscribers.
whatever
it
is
we
provide
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
and
there
maybe
some
advertisers
that
don’t
want
that
but
he
has
to
compete
with
advertisers
that
do
want
that
because
that’s
the
basis
for
which
this
--
there's
probably
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
there
may
be
a
great
many.
there
may
be
people
who
engage
in
mail
service.
there
are
a
lot
of
--
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
there
are
a
lot
of
organizations
that
sell
by
mail.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
would
want
it.
mr.
robert
c.
barnard
sure.
people
who
sell
records.
people
who
have
mail
order
services.
people
who
advertise
institutionally,
sure.
