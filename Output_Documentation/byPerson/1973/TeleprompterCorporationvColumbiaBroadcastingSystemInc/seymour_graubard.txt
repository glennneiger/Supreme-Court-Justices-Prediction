mr.
seymour
graubard
thank
you
sir.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
speaking
for
those
copyright
owners
who
are
independent
producers
and
who
license
their
works
to
television
broadcasters
and
to
others.
thus,
dina
corporation
which
i
represent
directly
is
owned
by
danny
kaye,
an
actor
and
by
his
wife,
sylvia,
fine
kaye
a
composer
and
lyricist.
they
do
not
broadcast
themselves,
any
of
their
productions.
they
license
their
productions.
so
do
the
other
named
co-plaintiffs
in
this
action.
and
so
do
many
others
including
producers
of
motion
pictures.
i’m
also
speaking
for
the
authors,
actors,
directors,
composers
and
musicians
who
sell
their
creative
output
to
the
producers.
under
their
guild
contracts,
they
receive
in
addition
to
their
compensation
for
the
initial
performance
of
their
works,
stipulated
percentages
of
the
amounts
paid
for
reruns
of
the
programs.
most
television
programs
even
if
they
are
fortunate
enough
to
be
rewarded
with
a
network
broadcast
do
not
recover
their
costs
through
that
initial
broadcast.
the
profits
that
may
be
earned,
generally
come
from
the
additional
showings
or
reruns
that
follow,
the
initial
network
performance.
both
the
producers
and
the
artists
who
create
these
programs
rely
on
these
returns,
these
reruns
for
their
ultimate
compensation.
now
the
term
--
mr.
seymour
graubard
yes
sir.
mr.
seymour
graubard
yes
sir.
that’s
correct.
mr.
seymour
graubard
that’s
right.
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
the
old
days,
even
the
producers
--
mr.
seymour
graubard
--
failed
to
have
legalize
the
values
of
--
mr.
seymour
graubard
residuals.
mr.
seymour
graubard
no
longer
the
case
today.
mr.
seymour
graubard
mr.
sokolow
has
explained
the
meaning
of
the
term
syndication.
generally
speaking,
once
the
initial
performance
is
over,
the
program
owner
licenses
individual
television
stations
to
perform
the
work
or
the
program
and
these
television
stations
obtain
their
own
advertising
revenues
for
the
programs.
as
some
members
of
this
court
may
have
noticed,
some
of
these
reruns
seem
to
go
on
forever.
and
there
is
a
different
scale
of
compensation
for
the
artists
depending
upon
how
many
reruns
there
are.
now
obviously,
a
program
has
a
greater
potential
audience
and
a
greater
sales
value
through
licensing,
if
it
has
not
previously
been
shown
in
the
local
area.
many
network
broadcasts
that
are
initially
licensed
are
limited
to
certain
regions.
no
broadcasts
through
broadcasting
stations
reach
the
entire
nation.
by
importing
distant
signals,
the
catv
systems
enter
the
market
for
these
programs
that
are
to
be
shown
initially
in
the
areas
not
previously
fortunate
enough
to
have
had
the
benefit
of
the
initial
performance.
thus
the
cable
performance
in
this
distant
area
is
frequently
and
exclusive
first
run
for
which
the
copyright
owners
received
nothing.
moreover,
the
copyright
owner
must
then
deal
in
these
areas
for
licensed
fees
based
on
second
showings
rather
than
on
initial
performances.
to
the
extent
that
the
copyright
owners
receive
a
smaller
amount
for
a
second
run,
the
creative
artists
similarly
suffer.
on
the
other
hand,
to
the
extent
that
the
cable
systems
would
pay
a
reasonable
royalty
for
a
license
to
perform
programs
received
distant
signal,
the
copyright
owners
and
the
artists
would
benefit.
we
believe
that
this
is
a
clear
case
for
the
enforcement
of
the
copyright
law
whose
purpose
and
design
were
to
reward
the
creators
of
programs
for
the
performance
of
their
works.
it
follows
that
the
copyright
owners
and
their
associated
creative
artists
also
support
the
contention
that
cable
systems
that
function
as
broadcasters
are
actually
performing
the
copyrighted
works
and
should
pay
royalties
for
the
use
they
make
of
these
works.
now
we
are
not
as
concerned
frankly
at
this
time
about
classifying
as
broadcasters,
those
cable
stations
that
have
innovated
programs
that
have
interconnection
that
go
advertising.
we
independents
and
artists
know
that
cable
television
today
is
still
growing.
by
the
end
of
the
decade,
it
is
predicted
that
approximately
one-half,
the
families
of
the
united
states
with
television
sets
will
be
linked
to
cable.
it
is
also
predicted
and
the
court
may
find
this
amply
demonstrated
in
the
briefs
before
it
that
pay
television
on
a
broad
scale
will
be
a
fact
that
there
may
be
two
way
connections
between
cable
stations
and
their
subscribers
and
in
short,
that
the
cable
stations
are
progressively
becoming
a
more
and
more
important
communication
element
in
our
society.
if
this
court
is
going
to
make
law
in
regard
to
the
function
of
a
cable
television
set
today,
not
as
in
fortnightly,
a
pair
of
giant
rabbit
ears
which
performed
none
of
these
functions.
but
if
it
is
going
to
view
cable
television
as
it
is
currently
developing
as
it
has
developed
since
fortnightly
and
as
its
--
on
the
well
on
the
road
to
become
in
the
future,
i
believe
the
court
will
find
that
cable
television
projectors
or
stations
will
be
major
competitors
if
not
the
major
competitor
of
the
broadcasters.
to
give
these
stations
the
unfair
competitive
advantage
of
being
able
to
perform
certain
works
without
the
payment
of
royalties,
is
very
bad
of
course
for
cbs.
mr.
seymour
graubard
i
recognized
that
your
honor
--
mr.
seymour
graubard
may
i
say,
correct
myself
and
say
i
hope
the
court
will
call
that
a
performance
but
i
will
correct
myself
by
saying
to
use
these
programs,
to
use
these
programs
means
potential
great
injury
for
the
television
broadcasters.
mr.
seymour
graubard
your
honor
i
would
not
personally
make
that
argument.
mr.
seymour
graubard
i
would
--
mr.
seymour
graubard
yes
your
honor.
the
--
mr.
seymour
graubard
oh!
you
mean
in
the
home?
mr.
seymour
graubard
not
--
mr.
seymour
graubard
not
in
any
case
before
this
court.
mr.
seymour
graubard
that’s
right
sir.
i
have
every
confidence
that
if
that
particular
question,
that
issue
reached
this
court
at
some
future
time,
this
court
would
deal
with
it
accordingly
as
it
saw
fit.
i
am
not
making
any
advocacy
of
a
position
which
i
believe
at
the
present
time
to
be
extreme.
rather
i
am
stating
that
i
believe
in
the
future
and
its
becoming
increasingly
obvious
today.
the
owners
of
copyright,
they’ll
be
losing
revenues
if
the
cable
stations
are
not
going
to
be
held
liable
to
pay
the
copyright
owners
proper
license
fees
just
as
do
the
television
stations.
mr.
seymour
graubard
thank
you.
mr.
seymour
graubard
well,
it
did
appear
before
the
fortnightly
decision
came
down
that
there
was
likely
to
be
legislation.
in
fact,
it
appeared
that
there
was
likely
to
be
legislation
when
this
particular
case
was
on
the

up
but
after
the
district
court
opinion
was
rendered,
the
catv
people
any

at
any

lost

in

that
was

now
your
honor
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
in
regard
to
this.
i’m
just
attempting
to
answer
question
directly.
mr.
seymour
graubard
i
could
not
answer
that,
perhaps
mr.
barnard
can.[laughter]
i
don’t
know
sir.
mr.
seymour
graubard
yes
sir.
and
(voice

--
mr.
seymour
graubard
--
i
am
told,
i
am
told
that
if
the
catv
people
are
motivated
by
what
eventuates
from
this
case,
there
is
likely
to
be
legislation.
mr.
seymour
graubard
there
have
been
committee
hearings,
yes
sir.
mr.
seymour
graubard
in
the
house
of
representatives,
certainly,
senate
--
i
don’t
believe
there
has
been
any
in
the
senate.
mr.
seymour
graubard
i
think
they
are
awaiting
a
final
determination
of
these
issues
as
far
as
this
point
is
concerned.
mr.
seymour
graubard
they
are
awaiting
a
resolution
of
issues
between
the
--
mr.
seymour
graubard
mr.
justice
white
you're
completely
correct.
i
have
no
excuse
or
alibi
to
offer
for
what
congress
has
done
or
is
contemplating
doing
--[laughter]
mr.
seymour
graubard
and
the
--
mr.
seymour
graubard
perhaps
they
have
greater
reliance
on
the
wisdom
of
this
court
than
on
their
own
means.
i
have
no
other
reason
to
offer.
mr.

mr.

have
been
committee
hearings,
yes
sir.
mr.
seymour
graubard
in
the
house
of
representatives,
certainly,
senate
--
i
don’t
believe
there
has
been
any
in
the
senate.
mr.
seymour
graubard
i
think
they
are
awaiting
a
final
determination
of
these
issues
as
far
as
this
point
is
concerned.
mr.
seymour
graubard
they
are
awaiting
a
resolution
of
issues
between
the
--
mr.
seymour
graubard
mr.
justice
white
you're
completely
correct.
i
have
no
excuse
or
alibi
to
offer
for
what
congress
has
done
or
is
contemplating
doing
--[laughter]
mr.
seymour
graubard
and
the
--
mr.
seymour
graubard
perhaps
they
have
greater
reliance
on
the
wisdom
of
this
court
than
on
their
own
means.
i
have
no
other
reason
to
offer.
mr.
seymour
graubard
thank
you
sir.
mr.
seymour
graubard
i
recognize
that.
