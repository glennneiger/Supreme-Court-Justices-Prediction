mr.
barnard.
mr.
graubard,
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
graubard,
as
i
remember,
the
fortnightly
case
was
argued
and
decided
back
in
1967-1968,
i
think
it
originated
in
1960.
we
were
told
at
that
time
that
this
was
a
matter
in
the
congress
and
that
it
was
about
ready
to
be
settled
in
the
congress,
it's
going
to
be
a
legislation.
now,
i
don’t
think
this
apparently,
all
we
still
have
is
a
statute
enacted
back
in
1909,
long
before
anybody
dreamed
of
television
set
and
let
alone
catv.
what's
the
status
now
of
the
situation
in
congress
because
this
of
course
is
the
basic
problem
in
this
case
as
we
all
know
is
trying
to
apply
a
1909
statute
to
technological
revolution.
