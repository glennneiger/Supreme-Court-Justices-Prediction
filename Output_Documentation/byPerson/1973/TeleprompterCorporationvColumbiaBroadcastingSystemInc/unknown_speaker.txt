no.

it’s
the

and
the

right.

how

now
what
(voice

unknown

in

when
the

--
when
the
farmington
catv
station
went
out

got
kttv,
an

in
los

that
was
something

isn’t
that
correct?

copyright
(voice

--
unknown

that’s
your
argument.
unknown

i
think
it’s
the
kttv,
it’s
that
independent

in
los

(voice

--
unknown

you’ve
picked
up

i
think.
unknown

was
kttv
from

in

its
about

yes.

it

be

that
violated

(voice

unknown

no.
even
if
you
didn’t
charge
them
anything.
unknown

right.
and
therefore
the
person
who
sold
you
the
television
set
could
be
a
contributory
infringer?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
you
--
why
would
it
be
other
than
a
social
occasion?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
difference
does
that
make?
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
copyright
act?
unknown
speaker
it
would
violate
copyright
if
you
put
on
a
dramatic
performance
so
you
--
whether
or
not
you
charged
admission,
don’t
you?
unknown
speaker
because
it
would
be
--
whether
it
not
--
it'd
be
in
public
--
unknown
speaker
--
but
whether
or
not
it’s
in
public
doesn’t
depend
upon
how
much
admission
is
charged,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
including
the

which
is
required

it’s
required
to
carry
all
the

(voice

unknown

you’re
getting
a

a

you

unknown

well,
there
is
no
question
as
whether
that
they
pay
whatever

royalties
or
due
with
respect
to
any
programming
that
they
originate.
unknown
speaker
yes,
i
know.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
an
issue
here,
i
thought
the
only
issue
was
as

the

its

under
the
copyright
act

--
most
originated

unknown

no,
i
want
to
know

in

that’s
what
i
thought.

teleprompter,
isn’t
it?

the

these
are

isn’t
that

they’ve
come
in

the
old

movies
unfortunately
those
old

stories
don’t
get

do
they
or
they
don't?
unknown

right.
unknown

residuals
--
unknown

right.
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
you
are
begging
the
question
when
you
say
they're
performing,
weren’t
you?
unknown
speaker
it's
like
saying
a
--
that
a
whole
--
unknown
speaker
the
television
set
uses
the
programs
and
if
its
not
done
in
private
there,
you
could
make
the
argument
that
a
violation
every
time
he
turns
on
his
set
of
the
copyright
laws,
if
it's
still
on
public.
unknown
speaker
oh!
it
can
be
made
just
the
same
way
you’re
making
this
one.
unknown

are
you
doing
that
for

purposes?
unknown

the

(voice

a

in
his
home
turning
on
a

as
he
isn't
selling
that
to

is
he?
unknown

this
case
--
unknown

if
the
statute
doesn’t
say
anything
at
all
about
doing
it
for
commercial

or
non-commercial
purposes
(voice

about
a

in

unknown

well,
congress
itself
might
have
some
interest.
will
they
only
move
if
the

people
are

unknown
speaker
is
there
a
bill
now
in
the
congress?
unknown
speaker
(voice

--
unknown

have
there
been

unknown

in

unknown

anything
reported
out
of
either
--
if
any
--
of
a
committee
in
either

unknown

they’re
awaiting
what?
unknown

but
you
think
they’re
awaiting?
unknown

that’s
very
nice.
unknown

only
as
the
1909
statute
to
guide

unknown

there
is
a
full

has
it
been
reported

and
what
would
that

will
provide?
unknown

well,
by
reason
of
your
activities,
they
are

knowing
it,
this
is
a

this
is
a

i
see.
and
the

also
advertises

doesn’t
it
if
you
subscribe
to
our

you’ll
get
los

stations.
unknown

actually
--
unknown

but
your
point
is
that
the
los

broadcaster
sells
to
advertisers
on

if
you

advertise
with
us,
your

will
be
