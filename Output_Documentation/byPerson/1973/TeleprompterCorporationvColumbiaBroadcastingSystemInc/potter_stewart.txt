certiorari
to
the
united

court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
litigation

they
commenced
this
litigation
in
1964
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
claiming
that
the
defendants
had
infringed
their
copyrights
by
intercepting
broadcast
transmissions
of
copyrighted
material
and
rechanneling
these
programs
through
various
community
antenna
television
systems
to
the
paying
subscribers.
systems
such
as
these
are
commonly
known
as
catv
systems.
the
suit
was
initially
stayed
by
agreement
of
the
parties
pending
this
court’s
decision
in
the
case
called
fortnightly
corporation
against
the
united
artists
television
corporation,
reported
in
volume
392
of
the
united
states
reports.
in
that
case,
decided
in
1968,
we
held
that
the
reception
and
distribution
of
television
broadcasts
by
the
catv
systems,
there
involved,
did
not
constitute
a
performance
within
the
meaning
of
the
copyright
act
and,
thus,
did
not
amount
to
copyright
infringement.
after
that
decision
the
plaintiffs
in
the
present
litigation
filed
supplemental
pleadings
in
which
they
sought
to
distinguish
the
five
catv
systems,
challenged
here,
from
those
whose
operations
had
been
found
not
to
constitute
copyright
infringement
in
the
fortnightly
case.
the
district
court
subsequently
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
the
plaintiffs’
cause
of
action
was
barred
by
the
fortnightly
decision.
on
appeal
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit,
the
judgment
was
affirmed
in
part
and
reversed
in
part,
and
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings.
both
the
plaintiffs
and
the
defendants
petitioned
for
certiorari,
and
because
of
the
seemingly
important
questions
of
federal
law
involved,
we
granted
both
petitions.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
detail
in
a
written
opinion
filed
today,
we
have
concluded
that
the
district
court
was
correct
in
holding
that
the
plaintiff’s
complaint
was
barred
by
this
court’s
fortnightly
decision.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed
in
part
and
reversed
in

these
cases
are
remanded
to
the
district
court

directions
to
reinstate
its
original
judgment.
