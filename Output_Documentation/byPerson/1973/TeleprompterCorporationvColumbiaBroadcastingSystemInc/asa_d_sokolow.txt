mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
the
court
did
agree
pursuant
to
our
application
your
honor
that
i
could
share
five
minutes
of
my
half
hour
time
with
my
co-counsel,
mr.
graubard
who
will
address
himself
to
the
question
of
the
syndication
market
and
the
effect
of
importation
of
distant
signals
on
copyright
owners
in
that
context
and
the
court
did
grant
that
request
your
honor.
this
lawsuit
is
not
a
lawsuit
involving
what
mr.
barnard
calls
antenna
technology.
the
ultimate
issue
here,
we
see
it
is
whether
the
copyright
act
is
going
to
be
declared
inoperative
with
respect
to
an
entire
industry.
because
the
cable
television
industry
as
it
exists
today
is
not
the
same
industry
that
had
existed
at
the
time
of
the
fortnightly
decision.
all
due
respect
to
the
court,
one
could
say
that
the
fortnightly
decision
was
outdated
almost
at
the
time
it
was
written.
fortnightly
was
decided
at
1968.
the
complaints
were
filed,
i
believe
in
1960.
the
record
was
filled
with
facts
prior
to
that
time.
fortnightly
involved
the
system
that
did
nothing
more
but
go
two-and-a-half
miles
out
of
town,
put
up
an
antenna
on
a
long
hill
--
big
hill
and
enhanced
the
reception
of
television
signals
which
were
over
the
air
in
those
communities
were
intended
to
be
received
by
the
members
of
those
communities,
were
in
fact
received
by
some
members
of
the
community
with
rooftop
antenna
and
received
by
others
with
cooperative
antennas.
that’s
all
that
the
fortnightly
system
did.
now,
at
the
time
that
the
fortnightly
issue
was
before
this
court,
the
court
was
informed
that
there
were
then
in
existence
other
cable
stations.
they
included
teleprompter
who
were
not
back
in
the
horse
and
buggy
days
of
fortnightly
but
which
were
importing
distant
signals
hundreds
of
miles
away
who
could
not
enter
a
particular
market
except
for
the
activity
of
the
cable
systems.
these
stations
were
originating
programming.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
teleprompter
cable
station
in
new
york
city
originates
more
programming
that
wcbs
tv,
are
owned
and
operated
affiliate
in
new
york.
they
were
selling
commercials
and
they
were
interconnecting
into
networks.
when
the
fortnightly
case
was
here,
the
question
was
what
was
the
performance,
all
that
we
had
to
guard
ourselves
your
honor
was
the
(inaudible)
we
thought
that
a
performance
consisted
of
a
retransmission
and
a
reproduction
of
a
copyrighted
work
and
in
broadcasting
parlance,
radio,
i
thought
that
the
electronic
transmission
or
retransmission
of
a
program
and
its
reception
by
the
public
constituted
a
performance.
i
thought
the
re-transmitter
and
the
receiver
were
both
performers.
but
the
receiver
was
not
performing
in
public
and
therefore
is
not
engaged
in
a
public
performance
and
he
wasn’t
a
copyright
violator.
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
might
very
well
your
honor.
and
if
i
called
someone
into
my
home,
because
in
the
fortnight
case
your
honor,
differentiated
between
broadcasters
and
viewers
but
i
think
that
if
i
brought
my
new
colored
television
set
into
my
home
and
charged
everybody
ten
dollars
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
if
i
invited
a
group
in,
it
could
be
a
public
performance.
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
i
don’t
think
so.
i
don’t
--
i
think
the
transmitter
of
that
television
programming
was
a
performer.
i
think
the
receiver
was
a
performer
but
that
the
transmitter
of
the
programming
was
performing
in
public
and
for
public.
and
if
you
came
in
and
invited
people
in,
other
than
the
social
occasion
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
well,
if
i
charged
ten
people
ten
dollars
to
see
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
i
think
it
would
be
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
i
don’t
know
whether
the
courts
would
that
if
i
invited
in
two
or
three
friends
to
watch
a
reception
that
that
we
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
yes.
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
doesn’t
--
does
not
your
honor.
well,
in
the
event
it
would
be
--
what
the
pre-fortnightly
law
was
as
far
as
the
performance
was
concerned
was
as
we
understand
mr.
justice
fortas
who
dissented
in
the
fortnightly
case
was
changed
so
that
now
we’ve
got
a
functional
test
as
to
what
a
performance
is
at
least
for
this
particular
industry.
now,
mr.
barnard
says
that
we’re
making
a
frontal
assault
on
the
fortnightly
decision.
i
think
that
we
are
entitled
to
recover
here
and
there
should
be
an
infringement
whether
the
fortnightly
decision
stands,
whether
it
falls,
whether
it’s
limited
to
its
own
facts.
of
course,
if
you
read
fortnightly,
fortnightly
says
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
functions,
what
place
does
cable
television
play
in
the
total
spectrum
of
the
broadcasting
industry
and
it
used
such
words
as
viewers,
passive
beneficiaries
on
the
viewers
side
of
the
line
as
contrast
with
broadcasters.
now,
i
can’t
imagine
a
television
viewer
or
a
passive
beneficiary
who
imports
distant
signals
or
originates
programming
or
who
sells
commercials
or
interconnects
into
a
network.
no,
i
know
who
performs
that
kind
of
a
function.
broadcasting
stations.
wcbs
tv
in
new
york
city
imports
a
local
signal
from
a
network
broadcasting
center
and
it
originates
programming,
it
sells
commercials
and
it’s
a
broadcasting.
so
does
the
teleprompter
cable
station
in
new
york
city.
it
receives
those
local
signals.
it
originates
programming
and
its
selling
commercials.
now,
when
the
case
was
here,
the
fortnightly
case
was
here,
mr.
barnard
didn’t
talk
to
this
court
about
importation
of
distant
signals.
he
said
repeatedly
in
that
oral
argument,
”it
were
in
the
area
where
reception
is
possible
off
the
air.”
we’re
in
the
area
where
reception
would've
been
expected
if
it
were
not
for
the
ruggedness
of
the
area.
there
was
no
talk
about
business
signals,
he
said
that
those
areas
were
in
the
service
area
of
the
broadcast
stations.
now,
what's
involved
in
the
importation
of
distant
signals
taking
that
function?
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn’t
invent
the
term,
the
earth
is
round
and
television
signals
on
the
earth
travel
in
straight
lines.
as
a
result,
as
an
engineering
matter,
television
signals
normally
don’t
travel
more
than
60
to
100
miles,
although
there
are
a
few
exceptions.
there
was
uncontradicted
evidence
in
the
record
on
that
subject.
furthermore,
the
fcc
is
always
regarded
as
a
policy
to
have
separate
markets.
they
don’t
want
super
stations
in
new
york
city
retransmitting
to
different
areas
and
therefore
los
angeles
is
a
separate
market
and
its
not
farmington.
now,
how
did
teleprompter
farmington
get
the
los
angeles
stations?
well,
what
it
did
was
to
procure
and
select
the
type
of
programming
what
it
--
that
it
wanted
mr.
justice
stewart.
that’s
what
you
said
in
fortnightly,
was
a
characteristic
of
a
broadcaster.
there
were
some
113
other
television
stations
as
close
to
or
closer
to
farmington
than
los
angeles.
but
they
wanted
those
los
angeles
stations
because
of
the
type
of
programming
that
they
had.
i’m
sure
they
had
sports.
i’m
sure
they
had
situation
comities.
i’m
sure
they
had
lots
of
things
to
get
those
signals
into
farmington.
there
was
no
way
of
getting
those
signals
into
farmington
other
than
by
this
importation
and
teleprompter
got
a
1,000
mile
microwave
transmission
link
in
order
to
bring
it
in
there.
and
the
los
angeles
stations
did
not
intend
that
their
programs
go
to
farmington.
and
that
copyright
owners
who
testified
at
this
trial
said
that
they
--
when
they
licensed
those
independent
stations
at
los
angeles,
they
did
not
intend
the
programs
to
go
to
farmington
because
they
were
looking
to
sell
those
programs
again
until
they
license
them
again
for
syndication
in
the
farmington
area.
that’s
the
subject
on
which
mr.
graubard
will
talk.
this
los
angeles
supermarket
or
the
used
car
salesman
who
was
sponsoring
the
program
on
the
los
angeles
station
had
no
interest
in
farmington.
there's
been
an
amicus
brief
submitted
there
by
mpaa
which
has
some
very
interesting
statistics
on
the
subject
that
mr.
justice
white
asked
about.
the
statistics
show
that
only
30%
of
the
advertising
on
national
television,
is
national
advertising,
70%
of
it
is
local
advertising,
spot
advertising,
those
kind
of
advertisers
have
no
interest
in
this.
mr.
barnard
closed
with
the
question
of
how
the
court
below
defined
distant
signals.
well,
the
court
started
out
by
defining
local
signals,
a
local
signals.
a
local
signal,
it
said
was
something
that
could
be
received
in
the
local
community
with
a
catv
antenna
for
example,
which
you
had
to
get
a
clearer
and
good
reception.
if
you
went
600
miles
or
800
miles
further,
if
you
had
to
locate
your
antenna
near
the
broadcasting
station
miles
and
miles
away
and
you
had
to
use
microwave
to
bring
it
in
there,
then
the
court
said
the
signal
is
presumptively
distant.
it's
costly
to
lay
miles
of
cable
and
to
go
through
this
microwave
apparatus.
if
teleprompter
didn’t
have
to
go
600
miles
to
los
angeles,
it
would
never
have
done
it.
so
the
supreme
court
--
excuse
me,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
with
respect
for
example
to
the
los
angeles
stations
which
went
600
miles
to
farmington,
they
were
presumptively
distant.
no
one
would
quarrel
with
that.
the
salt
lake
city
stations
with
400
odd
miles
away
from
great
falls,
no
way
that
those
signals
could
have
gotten
in
there.
noway
that
they
could
be
called
anything
but
distant.
the
denver
stations
were
something
like
a
160
miles
from
new
orleans.
no
question
about
the
fact
that
they
were
distant.
so
that
the
dispute
as
to
what
the
court
really
did
here
below,
i
think
is
rather
meaningless.
mr.
barnard
has
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
fcc
has
recently
refined
its
description
instead
of
now
talking
just
in
terms
of
grade
a
and
grade
b
contours,
they
now
use
the
term,
“significant
viewing.”
if
you
applied
the
significant
viewing
test,
the
current
fcc
test
to
the
signals
that
were
involved
in
our
case
or
with
the
exception
of
durango
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
imported
and
distant
signals
would
be
distant
signals
under
current
fcc
definition.
mr.
barnard
disagrees
with
our
arguing
totality
of
services
but
i
don’t
i
don’t
understand
how
we
can
talk
about
anything
but
totality
if
were
talking
about
function.
teleprompter
advertises
that
it
imports
distant
signals,
then
it
attracts
an
audience
and
the
audience
listens
till
the
teleprompter
originations.
and
that
new
audience
is
attracted
to
the
originations,
turns
on
the
commercials
and
listens
to
the
commercials.
now,
what
difference
does
it
make
that
its
on
a
different
channel.
the
court
of
appeals
said
maybe
there
would
be
a
different
result
if
you’re
on
a
different
channel.
well,
up
in
new
york
city
where
i
am,
that
teleprompter
channel
has
four
or
five
channels
on
which
its
originating,
programming
or
having
public
access
programming
or
showing
time
and
whether
or
its
running
an
a&p
report.
every
time
you
turn
on
to
that
other
channel,
you
are
not
watching
wcbs
tv,
it’s
not
enhancing
the
reception
of
the
signal.
it’s
blocking
it
out.
now,
that
might
be
desirable
because
the
fcc
encourages
this
type
of
activity
but
it
blocks
out
our
signal
just
as
much
as
if
they
had
run
those
originations
on
our
channel
two
in
new
york
city.
now,
its
true
that
if
teleprompter
weren’t
there,
channel
two
is
competing
with
channel
four
and
channel
five
and
channel
seven
and
the
viewer
has
the
same
option.
but
every
one
of
those
competitors
is
paying
copyright
royalties.
the
only
competitor
that’s
not
paying
copyright
royalty
is
teleprompter
and
make
no
mistake
about
it,
teleprompter
has
said
repeatedly
in
its
public
statements
that
it
was
a
competitor.
the
fortnightly
system
was
no
competitor
or
a
broadcaster
at
most,
it
enhanced
the
reception.
but
the
teleprompter
prospectuses
which
we
have
placed
into
evidence
here
state
that
they
are
competitive
with
broadcasters
for
programming,
for
personnel,
for
sponsors
and
for
content.
therefore
i
think
that
each
of
these
separate
functions,
one
feeds
on
the
other,
i
think
that
the
court
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
let
me
explain
it,
it
--
we
have
a
--
on
the
top
of
our
television
set
a
converter
which
is
provided
by
teleprompter,
it
has
all
the
usual
channels
plus
the
other
particular
channels.
so
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
yes,
of
course,
they
including
to
which
is
wcbs
to
the
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
definitely
sir.
and
it
does
carry
all
of
the
local
stations
and
the
uhf
stations
included
in
the
educational
channel
in
addition,
it
has
four
or
five
other
origination
channels.
all
i
was
saying
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
that
if
i
turn
that
dial
and
i
put
on
a
--
origination
channel
and
i’m
watching
the
new
york
knicks
or
the
new
york
rangers
which
are
pretty
populous
sports.
i’m
not
watching
channel
two
and
i
don’t
mind
that
if
it
can
apply
(voice
overlap)
-
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
well,
i’m
subscriber,
i
have
told
you
probably
rather
but
that
doesn’t
make
me
an
infringer
but
i
--[laughter]
but
--
so,
it
only
blocks
it
on
--
in
that
sense
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
that’s
the
only
differentiation
i
was
making
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
that
when
--
if
don’t
have
the
color,
cable
with
me,
it’s
a
question
of
free
competition
whether
i
change
--
turn
on
channel
two
or
channel
four,
let
them
pay
the
share
–
the
proper
share,
the
origination
of
the
programming
and
we’ll
all
be
happy.
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
i
don’t
think
that’s
correct.
i
did
stipulate
when
mr.
barnard
left
for
the
purpose
of
programming
which
they
originate,
you
know,
this
case
was
done
mainly
by
stipulations
your
honor.
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
i
do
not
believe
that
teleprompter
plays
for
the
music
that
it
uses
and
that
the
--
i
think
ascap
who
has
filed
a
brief
amicus
here
would
really
not
concede
that
its
being
paid
by
teleprompter
for
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
that
--
that’s
what
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
that’s
what
i’m
concerned
with
your
honor.
i
was
just
trying
to
answer
your
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
--
in
fact
the
paid
copyright
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
no,
its
not.
i’m
--
as
far
we’re
concerned,
that
ascap
issue
was
a
question
between
ascap,
and
then
we’ve
stipulated.
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
we’ll
concede
that
they
pay
those.
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
and
now
i’d
like
to
have,
mr.
graubard
addressed
himself
to
the
question
of
syndication,
i
want
to
explain
why
i’m
doing
that
syndication,
it’s
a
very
important
subject,
cbs
is
not
allowed
by
fcc
law
to
engage
in
syndication
anymore
so
i
thought
that
the
argument
would
more
appropriately
come
from
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
yes.
it
involves
your
honor
is
the
production
of
television
programming
which
maybe
shown
initially
on
a
network.
then
after
its
been
on
the
network
for
two
or
three
times,
it
maybe
sold
or
licensed
in
another
area
and
that’s
the
process
of
syndication
that
there
are
various
runs.
in
fact
sometimes
the
program
is
not
even
played
for
network
television,
it's
created
to
be
sold
in
one
market.
but
that
that
is
what
mr.
graubard's
clients
do
and
they
are
copyright
owners.
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
mr.
chief
justice
and
members
of
the
court.
the
court
did
agree
pursuant
to
our
application
your
honor
that
i
could
share
five
minutes
of
my
half
hour
time
with
my
co-counsel,
mr.
graubard
who
will
address
himself
to
the
question
of
the
syndication
market
and
the
effect
of
importation
of
distant
signals
on
copyright
owners
in
that
context
and
the
court
did
grant
that
request
your
honor.
this
lawsuit
is
not
a
lawsuit
involving
what
mr.
barnard
calls
antenna
technology.
the
ultimate
issue
here,
we
see
it
is
whether
the
copyright
act
is
going
to
be
declared
inoperative
with
respect
to
an
entire
industry.
because
the
cable
television
industry
as
it
exists
today
is
not
the
same
industry
that
had
existed
at
the
time
of
the
fortnightly
decision.
all
due
respect
to
the
court,
one
could
say
that
the
fortnightly
decision
was
outdated
almost
at
the
time
it
was
written.
fortnightly
was
decided
at
1968.
the
complaints
were
filed,
i
believe
in
1960.
the
record
was
filled
with
facts
prior
to
that
time.
fortnightly
involved
the
system
that
did
nothing
more
but
go
two-and-a-half
miles
out
of
town,
put
up
an
antenna
on
a
long
hill
--
big
hill
and
enhanced
the
reception
of
television
signals
which
were
over
the
air
in
those
communities
were
intended
to
be
received
by
the
members
of
those
communities,
were
in
fact
received
by
some
members
of
the
community
with
rooftop
antenna
and
received
by
others
with
cooperative
antennas.
that’s
all
that
the
fortnightly
system
did.
now,
at
the
time
that
the
fortnightly
issue
was
before
this
court,
the
court
was
informed
that
there
were
then
in
existence
other
cable
stations.
they
included
teleprompter
who
were
not
back
in
the
horse
and
buggy
days
of
fortnightly
but
which
were
importing
distant
signals
hundreds
of
miles
away
who
could
not
enter
a
particular
market
except
for
the
activity
of
the
cable
systems.
these
stations
were
originating
programming.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
teleprompter
cable
station
in
new
york
city
originates
more
programming
that
wcbs
tv,
are
owned
and
operated
affiliate
in
new
york.
they
were
selling
commercials
and
they
were
interconnecting
into
networks.
when
the
fortnightly
case
was
here,
the
question
was
what
was
the
performance,
all
that
we
had
to
guard
ourselves
your
honor
was
the
(inaudible)
we
thought
that
a
performance
consisted
of
a
retransmission
and
a
reproduction
of
a
copyrighted
work
and
in
broadcasting
parlance,
radio,
i
thought
that
the
electronic
transmission
or
retransmission
of
a
program
and
its
reception
by
the
public
constituted
a
performance.
i
thought
the
re-transmitter
and
the
receiver
were
both
performers.
but
the
receiver
was
not
performing
in
public
and
therefore
is
not
engaged
in
a
public
performance
and
he
wasn’t
a
copyright
violator.
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
might
very
well
your
honor.
and
if
i
called
someone
into
my
home,
because
in
the
fortnight
case
your
honor,
differentiated
between
broadcasters
and
viewers
but
i
think
that
if
i
brought
my
new
colored
television
set
into
my
home
and
charged
everybody
ten
dollars
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
if
i
invited
a
group
in,
it
could
be
a
public
performance.
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
i
don’t
think
so.
i
don’t
--
i
think
the
transmitter
of
that
television
programming
was
a
performer.
i
think
the
receiver
was
a
performer
but
that
the
transmitter
of
the
programming
was
performing
in
public
and
for
public.
and
if
you
came
in
and
invited
people
in,
other
than
the
social
occasion
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
well,
if
i
charged
ten
people
ten
dollars
to
see
the
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
i
think
it
would
be
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
i
don’t
know
whether
the
courts
would
that
if
i
invited
in
two
or
three
friends
to
watch
a
reception
that
that
we
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
yes.
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
doesn’t
--
does
not
your
honor.
well,
in
the
event
it
would
be
--
what
the
pre-fortnightly
law
was
as
far
as
the
performance
was
concerned
was
as
we
understand
mr.
justice
fortas
who
dissented
in
the
fortnightly
case
was
changed
so
that
now
we’ve
got
a
functional
test
as
to
what
a
performance
is
at
least
for
this
particular
industry.
now,
mr.
barnard
says
that
we’re
making
a
frontal
assault
on
the
fortnightly
decision.
i
think
that
we
are
entitled
to
recover
here
and
there
should
be
an
infringement
whether
the
fortnightly
decision
stands,
whether
it
falls,
whether
it’s
limited
to
its
own
facts.
of
course,
if
you
read
fortnightly,
fortnightly
says
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
functions,
what
place
does
cable
television
play
in
the
total
spectrum
of
the
broadcasting
industry
and
it
used
such
words
as
viewers,
passive
beneficiaries
on
the
viewers
side
of
the
line
as
contrast
with
broadcasters.
now,
i
can’t
imagine
a
television
viewer
or
a
passive
beneficiary
who
imports
distant
signals
or
originates
programming
or
who
sells
commercials
or
interconnects
into
a
network.
no,
i
know
who
performs
that
kind
of
a
function.
broadcasting
stations.
wcbs
tv
in
new
york
city
imports
a
local
signal
from
a
network
broadcasting
center
and
it
originates
programming,
it
sells
commercials
and
it’s
a
broadcasting.
so
does
the
teleprompter
cable
station
in
new
york
city.
it
receives
those
local
signals.
it
originates
programming
and
its
selling
commercials.
now,
when
the
case
was
here,
the
fortnightly
case
was
here,
mr.
barnard
didn’t
talk
to
this
court
about
importation
of
distant
signals.
he
said
repeatedly
in
that
oral
argument,
”it
were
in
the
area
where
reception
is
possible
off
the
air.”
we’re
in
the
area
where
reception
would've
been
expected
if
it
were
not
for
the
ruggedness
of
the
area.
there
was
no
talk
about
business
signals,
he
said
that
those
areas
were
in
the
service
area
of
the
broadcast
stations.
now,
what's
involved
in
the
importation
of
distant
signals
taking
that
function?
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
didn’t
invent
the
term,
the
earth
is
round
and
television
signals
on
the
earth
travel
in
straight
lines.
as
a
result,
as
an
engineering
matter,
television
signals
normally
don’t
travel
more
than
60
to
100
miles,
although
there
are
a
few
exceptions.
there
was
uncontradicted
evidence
in
the
record
on
that
subject.
furthermore,
the
fcc
is
always
regarded
as
a
policy
to
have
separate
markets.
they
don’t
want
super
stations
in
new
york
city
retransmitting
to
different
areas
and
therefore
los
angeles
is
a
separate
market
and
its
not
farmington.
now,
how
did
teleprompter
farmington
get
the
los
angeles
stations?
well,
what
it
did
was
to
procure
and
select
the
type
of
programming
what
it
--
that
it
wanted
mr.
justice
stewart.
that’s
what
you
said
in
fortnightly,
was
a
characteristic
of
a
broadcaster.
there
were
some
113
other
television
stations
as
close
to
or
closer
to
farmington
than
los
angeles.
but
they
wanted
those
los
angeles
stations
because
of
the
type
of
programming
that
they
had.
i’m
sure
they
had
sports.
i’m
sure
they
had
situation
comities.
i’m
sure
they
had
lots
of
things
to
get
those
signals
into
farmington.
there
was
no
way
of
getting
those
signals
into
farmington
other
than
by
this
importation
and
teleprompter
got
a
1,000
mile
microwave
transmission
link
in
order
to
bring
it
in
there.
and
the
los
angeles
stations
did
not
intend
that
their
programs
go
to
farmington.
and
that
copyright
owners
who
testified
at
this
trial
said
that
they
--
when
they
licensed
those
independent
stations
at
los
angeles,
they
did
not
intend
the
programs
to
go
to
farmington
because
they
were
looking
to
sell
those
programs
again
until
they
license
them
again
for
syndication
in
the
farmington
area.
that’s
the
subject
on
which
mr.
graubard
will
talk.
this
los
angeles
supermarket
or
the
used
car
salesman
who
was
sponsoring
the
program
on
the
los
angeles
station
had
no
interest
in
farmington.
there's
been
an
amicus
brief
submitted
there
by
mpaa
which
has
some
very
interesting
statistics
on
the
subject
that
mr.
justice
white
asked
about.
the
statistics
show
that
only
30%
of
the
advertising
on
national
television,
is
national
advertising,
70%
of
it
is
local
advertising,
spot
advertising,
those
kind
of
advertisers
have
no
interest
in
this.
mr.
barnard
closed
with
the
question
of
how
the
court
below
defined
distant
signals.
well,
the
court
started
out
by
defining
local
signals,
a
local
signals.
a
local
signal,
it
said
was
something
that
could
be
received
in
the
local
community
with
a
catv
antenna
for
example,
which
you
had
to
get
a
clearer
and
good
reception.
if
you
went
600
miles
or
800
miles
further,
if
you
had
to
locate
your
antenna
near
the
broadcasting
station
miles
and
miles
away
and
you
had
to
use
microwave
to
bring
it
in
there,
then
the
court
said
the
signal
is
presumptively
distant.
it's
costly
to
lay
miles
of
cable
and
to
go
through
this
microwave
apparatus.
if
teleprompter
didn’t
have
to
go
600
miles
to
los
angeles,
it
would
never
have
done
it.
so
the
supreme
court
--
excuse
me,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
with
respect
for
example
to
the
los
angeles
stations
which
went
600
miles
to
farmington,
they
were
presumptively
distant.
no
one
would
quarrel
with
that.
the
salt
lake
city
stations
with
400
odd
miles
away
from
great
falls,
no
way
that
those
signals
could
have
gotten
in
there.
noway
that
they
could
be
called
anything
but
distant.
the
denver
stations
were
something
like
a
160
miles
from
new
orleans.
no
question
about
the
fact
that
they
were
distant.
so
that
the
dispute
as
to
what
the
court
really
did
here
below,
i
think
is
rather
meaningless.
mr.
barnard
has
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
fcc
has
recently
refined
its
description
instead
of
now
talking
just
in
terms
of
grade
a
and
grade
b
contours,
they
now
use
the
term,
“significant
viewing.”
if
you
applied
the
significant
viewing
test,
the
current
fcc
test
to
the
signals
that
were
involved
in
our
case
or
with
the
exception
of
durango
that
the
court
of
appeals
found
imported
and
distant
signals
would
be
distant
signals
under
current
fcc
definition.
mr.
barnard
disagrees
with
our
arguing
totality
of
services
but
i
don’t
i
don’t
understand
how
we
can
talk
about
anything
but
totality
if
were
talking
about
function.
teleprompter
advertises
that
it
imports
distant
signals,
then
it
attracts
an
audience
and
the
audience
listens
till
the
teleprompter
originations.
and
that
new
audience
is
attracted
to
the
originations,
turns
on
the
commercials
and
listens
to
the
commercials.
now,
what
difference
does
it
make
that
its
on
a
different
channel.
the
court
of
appeals
said
maybe
there
would
be
a
different
result
if
you’re
on
a
different
channel.
well,
up
in
new
york
city
where
i
am,
that
teleprompter
channel
has
four
or
five
channels
on
which
its
originating,
programming
or
having
public
access
programming
or
showing
time
and
whether
or
its
running
an
a&p
report.
every
time
you
turn
on
to
that
other
channel,
you
are
not
watching
wcbs
tv,
it’s
not
enhancing
the
reception
of
the
signal.
it’s
blocking
it
out.
now,
that
might
be
desirable
because
the
fcc
encourages
this
type
of
activity
but
it
blocks
out
our
signal
just
as
much
as
if
they
had
run
those
originations
on
our
channel
two
in
new
york
city.
now,
its
true
that
if
teleprompter
weren’t
there,
channel
two
is
competing
with
channel
four
and
channel
five
and
channel
seven
and
the
viewer
has
the
same
option.
but
every
one
of
those
competitors
is
paying
copyright
royalties.
the
only
competitor
that’s
not
paying
copyright
royalty
is
teleprompter
and
make
no
mistake
about
it,
teleprompter
has
said
repeatedly
in
its
public
statements
that
it
was
a
competitor.
the
fortnightly
system
was
no
competitor
or
a
broadcaster
at
most,
it
enhanced
the
reception.
but
the
teleprompter
prospectuses
which
we
have
placed
into
evidence
here
state
that
they
are
competitive
with
broadcasters
for
programming,
for
personnel,
for
sponsors
and
for
content.
therefore
i
think
that
each
of
these
separate
functions,
one
feeds
on
the
other,
i
think
that
the
court
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
let
me
explain
it,
it
--
we
have
a
--
on
the
top
of
our
television
set
a
converter
which
is
provided
by
teleprompter,
it
has
all
the
usual
channels
plus
the
other
particular
channels.
so
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
yes,
of
course,
they
including
to
which
is
wcbs
to
the
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
definitely
sir.
and
it
does
carry
all
of
the
local
stations
and
the
uhf
stations
included
in
the
educational
channel
in
addition,
it
has
four
or
five
other
origination
channels.
all
i
was
saying
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
that
if
i
turn
that
dial
and
i
put
on
a
--
origination
channel
and
i’m
watching
the
new
york
knicks
or
the
new
york
rangers
which
are
pretty
populous
sports.
i’m
not
watching
channel
two
and
i
don’t
mind
that
if
it
can
apply
(voice
overlap)
-
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
well,
i’m
subscriber,
i
have
told
you
probably
rather
but
that
doesn’t
make
me
an
infringer
but
i
--[laughter]
but
--
so,
it
only
blocks
it
on
--
in
that
sense
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
that’s
the
only
differentiation
i
was
making
mr.
justice
rehnquist
is
that
when
--
if
don’t
have
the
color,
cable
with
me,
it’s
a
question
of
free
competition
whether
i
change
--
turn
on
channel
two
or
channel
four,
let
them
pay
the
share
–
the
proper
share,
the
origination
of
the
programming
and
we’ll
all
be
happy.
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
i
don’t
think
that’s
correct.
i
did
stipulate
when
mr.
barnard
left
for
the
purpose
of
programming
which
they
originate,
you
know,
this
case
was
done
mainly
by
stipulations
your
honor.
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
i
do
not
believe
that
teleprompter
plays
for
the
music
that
it
uses
and
that
the
--
i
think
ascap
who
has
filed
a
brief
amicus
here
would
really
not
concede
that
its
being
paid
by
teleprompter
for
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
that
--
that’s
what
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
that’s
what
i’m
concerned
with
your
honor.
i
was
just
trying
to
answer
your
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
--
in
fact
the
paid
copyright
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
no,
its
not.
i’m
--
as
far
we’re
concerned,
that
ascap
issue
was
a
question
between
ascap,
and
then
we’ve
stipulated.
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
we’ll
concede
that
they
pay
those.
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
and
now
i’d
like
to
have,
mr.
graubard
addressed
himself
to
the
question
of
syndication,
i
want
to
explain
why
i’m
doing
that
syndication,
it’s
a
very
important
subject,
cbs
is
not
allowed
by
fcc
law
to
engage
in
syndication
anymore
so
i
thought
that
the
argument
would
more
appropriately
come
from
--
mr.
asa
d.
sokolow
yes.
it
involves
your
honor
is
the
production
of
television
programming
which
maybe
shown
initially
on
a
network.
then
after
its
been
on
the
network
for
two
or
three
times,
it
maybe
sold
or
licensed
in
another
area
and
that’s
the
process
of
syndication
that
there
are
various
runs.
in
fact
sometimes
the
program
is
not
even
played
for
network
television,
it's
created
to
be
sold
in
one
market.
but
that
that
is
what
mr.
graubard's
clients
do
and
they
are
copyright
owners.
