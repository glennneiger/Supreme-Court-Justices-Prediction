in
the
bank,
but
i
will
be

do
you

under
the
united
states

the
trial
court

obligated
to
appoint

for
him?
justice

what
sort
of
sanctions
attach
under
oregon
law
to
the
failure
of
a
defendant
who
was
required
to
pay
counsel
fees?
what
is
citation

contempt,
if
he
failed
to
do
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
a
defense
on
his
part
in
the
contempt
hearing
that
he
is
unable
to
do
it,
like
for
instance
a
contempt
hearing
on
a
support
order
in
a
matrimonial
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
we
know
anything
about
the
position
of
the
oregon
law
as
to
whether
if
in
a
probation
revocation
hearing,
he
were
to
say,
i
simply
am
not
able
to
make
the
payment
whether
they
would
nonetheless
revoke
his
probation?

mr.
gillette,
in
your
addendum,
i
noticed
that
for
multnomah
county,
which
i
assume
is
by
far
the
most
populous
county
in
the
state,
the
answer
is,
yes
they
do
utilize
the
system
but
there's
nobody
making
payment
and
there
has
been
nothing
collected
in
1973,
is
there
anything
peculiar
about
multnomah?
