justice
potter
stewart
mr.
kuhn,
i
think
you
told
us
that,
first
of
all
the
statute
by
its
terms
is
permissive,
it
authorizes
the
judge
to
do
this,
it
doesn't
require
to
and
you
told
us
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
variation
in
the
various
--
justice
potter
stewart
now
the
courts
in
oregon,
depending
upon
the
particular
judge
and
i
suppose
in
any
court
upon
the
particular
case?
justice
potter
stewart
my
brother
blackmun
asked
you
this
question,
and
i
would
like
to
follow
it
up.
do
you
suppose
that
even
in
the
total
absence
of
the
statute,
wouldn't
it
arguably
be
a
permissible
condition
of
probation
to
require
that
the
convicted
person
put
on
probation
should
repay
the
court-appointed
lawyer
to
the
extent
that
he
could,
when
he
could?
certainly,
it's
a
very
usual
thing
that
requires
a
condition
of
probation,
reparations
to
the
victim
for
example,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
i
appreciate
they
are
not
exactly
the
same
and
that's
the
reason
i
am
asking
you
the
question.
generally
speaking,
all
kinds
of
conditions
that
can
be
imposed
on
probation,
can
they
not?
justice
potter
stewart
staying
away
from
various
people,
staying
away
from
various
places,
doing
a
steady
job.
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
any
court,
anywhere
unless
there
were
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
specific
statutory
provision
against
it?
justice
potter
stewart
as
a
condition
of
probation?
justice
potter
stewart
so
the
statute
maybe
really
then
i
have
much
to
do
with
it,
whether
or
not
it
is
just
a
valid
condition?
justice
potter
stewart
it
was
a
federal
judge?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
also
had
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
this
happens
when
at
the
initial
appearance?
justice
potter
stewart
well
is
the
arraignment
--
the
arraignment
is
not
the
same
as
initial
appearance,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
that's
information
you
don't
have
indictment
or
something?
justice
potter
stewart
and
then
he
is
bound
over?
justice
potter
stewart
the
second
opinion
and
judgment
that
i
have
for
the
court
this
morning
is
in
the
case
of
prince
eric
fuller,
petitioner
against
the
state
of
oregon,
respondent,
number
73-5280,
a
case
which
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
oregon.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
indigent
at
the
time
he
was
brought
to
oregon
state
court
upon
serious
criminal
charges.
the
state
provided
a
lawyer
to
represent
him
as
well
as
a
professional
investigator
to
aid
in
his
defense.
he
ultimately
pleaded
guilty
to
one
of
the
charges
against
him
and
was
placed
on
probation.
one
of
the
conditions
of
this
probation
was
that
he
repay
to
the
state
the
cause
of
his
legal
defense
in
the
event
that
he
becomes
able
to
make
these
payments
without
hardship.
this
condition
was
imposed
under
the
authority
of
a
state
statute
and
it's
constitutional
validity
was
upheld
on
appeal
in
the
oregon
courts.
the
petitioner
attacks
the
state's
recoupment
statute
upon
two
separate
constitutional
grounds.
first
he
contends
that
the
classifications
made
by
the
recoupment
statute,
violate
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
second,
he
argues
that
the
recoupment
statute
impairs
the
right
of
an
indigent
to
the
effective
representation
of
counsel
under
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
some
detail
in
a
written
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reject
both
of
these
claims
and
accordingly
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
oregon
court.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment

mr.
justice
marshall
has

dissenting
opinion

mr.
justice
brennan
has
joined.
