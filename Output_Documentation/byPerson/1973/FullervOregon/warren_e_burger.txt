mr.
kuhn,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

e.

not
very
substantial
then
i
take
it
from
what
you
describe.
chief
justice
warren
e.

now
what
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
solicitor
general.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
soon
after
the
arrest
does
this
usually
take
place
in
oregon?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that's
the
big
metropolitan
part
of
the
states,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
so
they
probably
have
more
important
things
to
do,
more
important
things
to
do
than
trying
to
enforce
the
statute.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
did
you
say
that
$9,000.00
some
dollars
was
the
total
amount
collected
in
the
whole
state
in
one
year?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
this
is
certainly
a
very
narrowing
construction
of
the
statute
by
the
supreme
court,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
this
statute
will
have
almost
no
application,
except
in
a
situation
where
the
defendant
accused
comes
in
with
a
--
whether
we
call
it
a
plea
negotiation
or
a
plea
discussion,
whatever
it
is.
there
is
presented
to
the
court
the
idea
that
the
man
will
enter
a
plea
of
guilty,
if
he
receives
probation.
and
that
the
probation
is
urged
because
he
has
a
good
job
with
the
substantial
income
of
the
family
and
then
the
court
would
say,
i
will
accept
the
plea
and
grant
probation
provided
you
pay
$25.00
a
month
until
the
total
cost
of
your
defense
is
made
of.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
might
come
in
from
the
defendant
however
with
the
district
attorney
taking
no
position
at
all.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
solicitor
general.
do
you
have
anything
further
mr.
kuhn?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
gentlemen.
the
case
is
submitted.
