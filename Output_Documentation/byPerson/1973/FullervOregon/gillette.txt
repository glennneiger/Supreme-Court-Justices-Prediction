mr.
gillette
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
a
number
of
questions
from
the
court
today
have
raised
the
essential
issues,
and
the
case
and
i
should
like,
if
i
may
to
simply
refer
back
to
those
questions
and
deal
with
the
approach
of
the
state
of
oregon,
i
would
like
to
take
with
regard
to
those
questions.
first
of
all
with
regard
to
the
chilling
effect
question,
the
question
was
raised
by
mr.
justice
blackmun,
as
to
whether
or
not
in
any
case,
in
any
jurisdiction
a
judge
could
impose
a
condition
such
as
the
one
imposed
on
prince
eric
fuller
in
this
case
and
we
would
submit
that
with
the
exception
of
california,
which
apparently
has
decided
in
re
allen
that
you
can't
do
that.
the
answer
is
probably
yes
in
most
jurisdictions.
certainly,
i
believe
it's
yes
in
oregon
and
in
fact
there
is
in
the
federal
district
court
in
oregon
at
this
time.
another
case,
washington
versus
music,
which
has
been
stayed
pending
the
result
in
this
case,
where
the
judge
purported
to
make
exactly
this
condition
of
probation
based
upon
his
inherent
power
and
not
apply
any
statutory
power.
mr.
gillette
no,
it's
a
district
judge
in
the
county
in
northern
oregon.
his
explanation
of
why
he
imposed
the
condition
was
that
he
believed
that
he
had
the
inherent
power
to
do
it.
mr.
gillette
he
also
had
the
statute
which
he
didn't
even
know
about
it.
that's
what
happened.
the
case
in
other
respect
similar
to
this
one,
it
would
appear
that
the
defendant
in
fact
was
capable
of
paying.
but
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
way
attorneys
are
appointed
in
these
situations
is
usually
--
it
usually
arises
as
a
result
of
a
relatively
summary
proceeding.
an
individual
is
brought
before
an
arraigning
magistrate
and
the
first
concern
of
the
magistrate
is
that
the
individual
be
advised
that
he
has
been
charged
with
the
criminal
offense
and
secondly,
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
individual
has
counsel
and
since
usually
he
doesn't
in
oregon
or
for
that
matter,
almost
anywhere
else.
the
next
inquiry
is,
can
you
afford
one?
and
the
answer
frequently
is
not
a
simple
yes
or
no.
the
answer
is,
i
don't
know,
because
the
individual
may
be
for
the
first
time
encountering
the
question
of
whether
he
can
afford
counsel.
the
court
will
in
most
instances
err
on
the
side
of
appointing
an
attorney,
rather
than
let
the
defendant
go
without
counsel
any
longer
and
i
would
submit
that
that
is
definitely
the
best
choice.
the
individual
needs
help
then
and
the
court
in
rather
summary
fashion
is
going
to
get
him
a
lawyer
unless
the
court
is
convinced
that
he
can
get
his
own.
now,
it
may
turn
out
subsequently
--
mr.
gillette
at
the
initial
--
the
initial
appearance,
that's
right.
this
usually
although
not
always,
usually
arises,
because
the
individual
was
arrested
without
a
warrant,
pursuant
of
having
been
arrested
on
probable
cause.
mr.
gillette
well,
a
decision
on
it's
release
has
to
be
made
within
36
hours.
it
could
take
as
long
as
two-and-a-half
days
for
the
arraignment
to
occur
if
he
is
arrested
on
a
friday
night
and
he
is
not
arraigned
until
monday
morning.
the
difference
between
the
release
decision
and
the
attorney
decision
is
simply
based
upon
the
fact.
we
haven't
quite
caught
up
procedurally
in
the
latter
matter
with
the
former.
i
would
expect
that
within
two
years
or
so,
we
are
going
to
get
to
the
point
where
we
arraign
everyday,
no
matter
whether
it
is
weekend
or
not.
mr.
gillette
not
always;
not
always;
no.
usually
it
is,
because
the
way
we
process
things
of
an
individual
has
been
arrested
even
on
probable
cause
and
information
of
felony
or
information
of
misdemeanor,
the
charging
document
has
been
prepared
by
the
time
he
appears
in
court,
even
if
it
is
a
matter
of
three
or
four
hours.
mr.
gillette
we
have
indictments
but
normally
speaking
the
individual
who's
been
arrested
is
appearing
before
an
inferior
magistrate
at
that
time
and
the
grand
jury
has
no
time
to
proceed
yet.
we
have
a
bifurcated
system
in
which
the
individual
gets
arraigned,
gets
the
chance
for
preliminary
hearing,
and
then
he
is
bound
over.
mr.
gillette
and
then
he
is
bound
over,
that's
right.
so
he
gets
--
in
fact,
he
gets
attorneys
appointed
twice,
if
he
goes
to
that
process.
the
same
one
is
normally
appointed
the
second
time
around,
but
the
concern
is
always,
does
he
have
a
lawyer.
if
he
doesn't,
let's
get
him
one
because
we
want
to
get
down
with
the
rest
of
the
procedure.
now,
the
question
was
raised
by
mr.
justice
brennan
as
to
which
counties
follow
this
practice
in
oregon
and
to
what
extent?
and
because
no
one
had
ever
tried
to
figure
this
out,
i
conducted
what
is
unfortunately
a
most
informal
poll,
but
it
appears
in
the
addendum
of
my
brief
at
page
30.
it
indicates
that
the
majority
of
counties
are
utilizing
the
practice,
although
to
a
limited
extent.
i
think
the
largest
amount
collected
during
calendar
year
1973
was
$9,220.00.
that's
a
fairly
sensible
figure
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
is
seldom
going
to
happen
that
an
individual
who
is
genuinely
indigent
at
the
time
he
seeks
counsel
improves
upon
his
condition
by
the
time
he
is
found
guilty
of
the
charge.
mr.
gillette
$375.00
as
investigator's
fees.
and
i
cannot,
for
the
moment,
remember
what
the
record
discloses
as
to
the
attorney's
fees.
part
of
the
problem
here
is
the
decision
to
pay
them
was
made
on
an
informal
basis
outside
the
courtroom
door.
the
defendant's
father
actually
paid
the
money.
the
defendant's
father
was
very
wealthy
and
had
flown
out
from
philadelphia
and
suddenly
become
concerned
with
his
son's
affairs
finally
after
he's
been
arrested
and
on
a
delayed
basis
retained
the
lawyer
and
paid
him.
so
we
have
a
less
than
perfect
fact
situation
in
that
regard.
mr.
gillette
yes,
sir
there
is.
first
of
all,
there's
the
statutory
scheme,
which
sets
forth
to
the
minimum
fee
and
that's
usually
the
maximum
fee
as
it
turns
out.
that's
usually
the
fee
paid.
in
extraordinary
cases,
the
judge
will
upon
a
proper
showing
by
affidavit
from
the
attorney,
grant
certain
additional
amounts,
but
it
is
rare
that
he
does
this.
mr.
gillette
that's
right.
the
statute
itemized
is
the
various
dispositions
that
may
be
made
and
sets
forth
the
fees
that
are
to
be
paid
in
this
case,
they
are
very
low.
it
would
be
hard
to
make
a
living
out
of
it
at
least.
mr.
gillette
the
peculiarity
of
multnomah
county
is
they
wouldn't
talk
to
me.
they
said,
yes
we
are
doing
it
but
we
don't
have
the
statistics
and
we
are
too
busy
to
give
them
to
you.
mr.
gillette
that's
right,
that's
portland.
mr.
gillette
my
experience
has
been
that,
that
at
least
is
their
judgment.
yes,
sir.
mr.
gillette
that's
right;
that's
right.
i
should
have
explained
that
i
think
in
the
addendum.
mr.
gillette
that's
right.
we
got
an
answer
specifically
to
that
question.
mr.
gillette
no,
$9220
was
the
total
amount
collected
in
clackamas
county,
which
is
a
bedroom
county
adjacent
to
multnomah
county
based
upon
i
think
30
or
40
individuals
paying.
and
that
was
the
largest
amount
that
was
reported
to
us.
we
necessarily
conducted
the
survey
over
a
brief
period
of
time.
i
suspect
however
this
case
turns
out
in
oregon
law
review,
we'll
finally
find
out
what
true
facts
are
as
published
in
article
i.
mr.
gillette
it's
been
going
on
sporadically
for
perhaps
for
the
last
eight
or
ten
years;
it's
rare.
mr.
gillette
i
think
it
was
passed
in
1961.
but
the
practice
has
been
relatively
rare,
because
as
i
say
while
the
judges
may
not
uniformly
follow
the
fuller
interpretation
which
was
placed
on
the
statute
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
may
not
have
always
limited
themselves
to
those
individuals,
who
in
fact
really
weren't
indigent
in
making
the
requirement.
at
least
now,
where
the
court
of
appeals
has
affirmatively
said
that
it
is
what
they
must
find,
but
the
matter
really
isn't
indigent.
and
that
he
can
make
the
payment
without
hardship,
either
to
himself
or
his
family,
the
amount
of
privilege
is
going
to
be
limited.
mr.
gillette
i
don't
know.
i
wasn't
at
all
involved
in
the
matter
at
that
time
and
i
have
no
idea
what
they
had
in
mind.
mr.
gillette
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
believe
that
if
the
statute
could
not
survive
constitutional
muster
under
this
construction,
you
could
not
write
one
provided
for
recoupment.
so
we
believe,
i
hesitate
to
make
a
statement
as
quite
that
hyperbolic,
but
i
think
it
comes
close
to
that.
the
court
was
concerned
to
say
what
was
being
done
and
so
they
limited
as
much
as
they
could
in
examining
this
court's
decision
in
rinaldi
versus
yeager
and
in
the
strange
case.
it
was
clear
that
this
court
was
going
to
examine
not
just
the
face
of
the
statute,
but
the
way
it
was
applied
and
so
the
court
wanted
to
be
sure,
absolutely
sure
that
the
formula
of
words
utilized
in
the
statute
wasn't
just
given
a
lip
service.
that
in
fact,
the
person
who
was
required
to
make
these
payments
was
affirmatively
not
indigent,
in
fact
was
capable
of
making
the
payments
and
in
fact
even
saying
that
he
is
not
indigent,
maybe
inaccurate
because
whatever
indigency
is,
the
ability
to
make
a
payment
without
hardship
to
oneself
or
one's
family
is
probably
a
financial
condition,
better
than
not
being
indigent.
mr.
gillette
no,
i
have
not
had
the
opportunity
to
find
out.
this
is
the
one
record
i
have
seen
on
the
question.
i
have
encountered
one
case
under
an
older
statute
where
with
regards
to
something
mr.
kuhn
said,
where
the
statute
provided
that
a
losing
appellant
would
have
cost
on
appeal
assessed
against
him.
we
had
a
situation
there,
where
an
individual
had
cost
assessed
against
him
and
what
appeared
to
be
an
unfair
situation.
that
statute
was
never
challenge
and
frankly,
i
think
was
unconstitutional
because
it
applied
to
individuals
who
obviously
couldn't
have
paid
and
in
fact
were
incarcerated,
but
the
legislature
had
the
good
sense
to
repeal
it
before
we
were
faced
as
trying
to
come
up
with
the
construction
that
would
have
saved
it.
and
the
particular
case,
gave
rise
to
this
information,
which
occurred
about
a
month
ago.
i
think
we
got
resolved,
by
simply
pointing
out
that
it
wasn't
there.
but
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
see
a
hearing
under
this
new
procedure.
i
don't
think
there
are
going
to
be
very
many.
this
condition
is
rarely
imposed
in
the
--
mr.
gillette
no.
i
don't
think
there
are
going
to
be
many
hearings.
at
least
with
regard
to
revocation
under
this
situation
because
in
some
respects
this
is
the
easiest
condition
to
meet.
if
an
individual
is
really
determined
to
survive
on
probation,
rather
than
have
it
revoked
he
is
going
to
meet
this
if
anything.
it
is
the
easiest
affirmative
index
to
give
to
the
court
that
he
is
meeting
the
terms
of
probation.
and
so
we're
confident
that
it's
going
to
work
in
those
few
instances
in
which
it
applies.
now,
justice
rehnquist
asked
about
sanctions
and
the
answer
to
that,
i
think
was
fairly
well
heard.
the
sanction
is
contempt
and
the
sanction
applies
not
just
to
individuals
placed
on
probation,
the
sanction
speaks
to
all
convicted
individuals
who
have
this
condition
imposed
upon
them.
and
mr.
kuhn
has
suggested
this
has
never
happened
with
respect
to
a
penitentiary
inmate.
we
have
no
statistics
to
show
that
one
way
or
another.
practically
speaking,
however,
i
suspect
that's
true,
not
because
the
courts
as
a
matter
of
practice
are
trying
to
distinguish
between
those
who
are
placed
on
probation
and
those
who
are
not,
but
simply
because
people
who
go
to
jail
by
and
large
have
even
less
chance
to
improve
upon
their
original
condition
of
indigency
than
to
those
who
remain
outside.
and
in
fact,
one
of
the
reasons
sometimes
that
an
individual
is
granted
probation
in
addition
to
other
considerations
is
the
fact
that
he's
got
a
job
and
he
is
maintaining
the
job
and
he
is
caring
for
his
family
and
he
showed
another
ways
that
he
is
a
contributing
citizen,
whatever
his
particular
offense
may
have
been.
so
i
think
the
reasons
for
that
distinction
if
in
fact
they
are
accurately
portrayed,
and
i
am
willing
to
concede
that
they
probably
are,
are
reasons
which
arises
out
of
the
particular
concern
involved,
and
there's
really
no
way
ever
to
get
around
that
kind
of
problem.
mr.
gillette
i
am
not
sure
i
can
say
--
i
follow
that,
i
am
not
sure
i
can
say
it
will
arise
in
all
the
cases
that
limited
but
they
would
be
nearly
so
limited,
simply
because
of
the
nature
the
condition
that
the
fuller
decision
places
on
imposing
on
that
requirement.
part
of
the
reason,
i
hesitate
on
that
is
because
judges
rarely
in
oregon
want
to
listen
to
any
recommendation
with
regard
to
sentence
and
that
is
not
part
of
plea
negotiations
normally,
with
the
exception
of
one
county.
da's
don't
make
such
recommendations
and
judges
wouldn't
listen
if
they
did,
regarding
that
is
their
province
and
not
the
district
attorney's.
mr.
gillette
that
happens,
they
tried.
now
with
regard,
if
i
may
to
the
permit
of
equal
protection
question,
counsel
has
urged
this
court
as
it
was
urged
upon
the
oregon
court,
that
james
versus
strange
is
applicable
here,
because
the
oregon
statute
just
like
the
kansas
statute
in
some
way
affirmatively
denies
to
individuals
subjected
to
this
condition.
those
exemptions
which
are
granted
to
other
judgment
debtors
in
fact
this
isn't
so.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
specifically
says
that
it
isn't
so.
it
says
these
people
are
entitled
to
the
same
exemptions
everybody
else
is.
i
have
set
forth
the
statutory
scheme
in
my
brief
and
i
think
it
shows
that
those
exemptions
are
afforded
in
the
same
way
they
are
afforded
to
every
other
judgment
debtor.
so
i
would
submit
if
that
ground
in
james
versus
strange
was
the
full
reason
this
court
felt
constrained
to
strike
that
statute,
then
james
versus
strange
is
just
not
the
point
at
all
in
this
legislation.
now,
i
see
from
my
notes
that
i
have
covered
the
other
particular
point
that
i
wanted
to
mention
to
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
other
questions
i
am
done.
mr.
gillette
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
a
number
of
questions
from
the
court
today
have
raised
the
essential
issues,
and
the
case
and
i
should
like,
if
i
may
to
simply
refer
back
to
those
questions
and
deal
with
the
approach
of
the
state
of
oregon,
i
would
like
to
take
with
regard
to
those
questions.
first
of
all
with
regard
to
the
chilling
effect
question,
the
question
was
raised
by
mr.
justice
blackmun,
as
to
whether
or
not
in
any
case,
in
any
jurisdiction
a
judge
could
impose
a
condition
such
as
the
one
imposed
on
prince
eric
fuller
in
this
case
and
we
would
submit
that
with
the
exception
of
california,
which
apparently
has
decided
in
re
allen
that
you
can't
do
that.
the
answer
is
probably
yes
in
most
jurisdictions.
certainly,
i
believe
it's
yes
in
oregon
and
in
fact
there
is
in
the
federal
district
court
in
oregon
at
this
time.
another
case,
washington
versus
music,
which
has
been
stayed
pending
the
result
in
this
case,
where
the
judge
purported
to
make
exactly
this
condition
of
probation
based
upon
his
inherent
power
and
not
apply
any
statutory
power.
mr.
gillette
no,
it's
a
district
judge
in
the
county
in
northern
oregon.
his
explanation
of
why
he
imposed
the
condition
was
that
he
believed
that
he
had
the
inherent
power
to
do
it.
mr.
gillette
he
also
had
the
statute
which
he
didn't
even
know
about
it.
that's
what
happened.
the
case
in
other
respect
similar
to
this
one,
it
would
appear
that
the
defendant
in
fact
was
capable
of
paying.
but
i
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
way
attorneys
are
appointed
in
these
situations
is
usually
--
it
usually
arises
as
a
result
of
a
relatively
summary
proceeding.
an
individual
is
brought
before
an
arraigning
magistrate
and
the
first
concern
of
the
magistrate
is
that
the
individual
be
advised
that
he
has
been
charged
with
the
criminal
offense
and
secondly,
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
individual
has
counsel
and
since
usually
he
doesn't
in
oregon
or
for
that
matter,
almost
anywhere
else.
the
next
inquiry
is,
can
you
afford
one?
and
the
answer
frequently
is
not
a
simple
yes
or
no.
the
answer
is,
i
don't
know,
because
the
individual
may
be
for
the
first
time
encountering
the
question
of
whether
he
can
afford
counsel.
the
court
will
in
most
instances
err
on
the
side
of
appointing
an
attorney,
rather
than
let
the
defendant
go
without
counsel
any
longer
and
i
would
submit
that
that
is
definitely
the
best
choice.
the
individual
needs
help
then
and
the
court
in
rather
summary
fashion
is
going
to
get
him
a
lawyer
unless
the
court
is
convinced
that
he
can
get
his
own.
now,
it
may
turn
out
subsequently
--
mr.
gillette
at
the
initial
--
the
initial
appearance,
that's
right.
this
usually
although
not
always,
usually
arises,
because
the
individual
was
arrested
without
a
warrant,
pursuant
of
having
been
arrested
on
probable
cause.
mr.
gillette
well,
a
decision
on
it's
release
has
to
be
made
within
36
hours.
it
could
take
as
long
as
two-and-a-half
days
for
the
arraignment
to
occur
if
he
is
arrested
on
a
friday
night
and
he
is
not
arraigned
until
monday
morning.
the
difference
between
the
release
decision
and
the
attorney
decision
is
simply
based
upon
the
fact.
we
haven't
quite
caught
up
procedurally
in
the
latter
matter
with
the
former.
i
would
expect
that
within
two
years
or
so,
we
are
going
to
get
to
the
point
where
we
arraign
everyday,
no
matter
whether
it
is
weekend
or
not.
mr.
gillette
not
always;
not
always;
no.
usually
it
is,
because
the
way
we
process
things
of
an
individual
has
been
arrested
even
on
probable
cause
and
information
of
felony
or
information
of
misdemeanor,
the
charging
document
has
been
prepared
by
the
time
he
appears
in
court,
even
if
it
is
a
matter
of
three
or
four
hours.
mr.
gillette
we
have
indictments
but
normally
speaking
the
individual
who's
been
arrested
is
appearing
before
an
inferior
magistrate
at
that
time
and
the
grand
jury
has
no
time
to
proceed
yet.
we
have
a
bifurcated
system
in
which
the
individual
gets
arraigned,
gets
the
chance
for
preliminary
hearing,
and
then
he
is
bound
over.
mr.
gillette
and
then
he
is
bound
over,
that's
right.
so
he
gets
--
in
fact,
he
gets
attorneys
appointed
twice,
if
he
goes
to
that
process.
the
same
one
is
normally
appointed
the
second
time
around,
but
the
concern
is
always,
does
he
have
a
lawyer.
if
he
doesn't,
let's
get
him
one
because
we
want
to
get
down
with
the
rest
of
the
procedure.
now,
the
question
was
raised
by
mr.
justice
brennan
as
to
which
counties
follow
this
practice
in
oregon
and
to
what
extent?
and
because
no
one
had
ever
tried
to
figure
this
out,
i
conducted
what
is
unfortunately
a
most
informal
poll,
but
it
appears
in
the
addendum
of
my
brief
at
page
30.
it
indicates
that
the
majority
of
counties
are
utilizing
the
practice,
although
to
a
limited
extent.
i
think
the
largest
amount
collected
during
calendar
year
1973
was
$9,220.00.
that's
a
fairly
sensible
figure
in
view
of
the
fact
that
it
is
seldom
going
to
happen
that
an
individual
who
is
genuinely
indigent
at
the
time
he
seeks
counsel
improves
upon
his
condition
by
the
time
he
is
found
guilty
of
the
charge.
mr.
gillette
$375.00
as
investigator's
fees.
and
i
cannot,
for
the
moment,
remember
what
the
record
discloses
as
to
the
attorney's
fees.
part
of
the
problem
here
is
the
decision
to
pay
them
was
made
on
an
informal
basis
outside
the
courtroom
door.
the
defendant's
father
actually
paid
the
money.
the
defendant's
father
was
very
wealthy
and
had
flown
out
from
philadelphia
and
suddenly
become
concerned
with
his
son's
affairs
finally
after
he's
been
arrested
and
on
a
delayed
basis
retained
the
lawyer
and
paid
him.
so
we
have
a
less
than
perfect
fact
situation
in
that
regard.
mr.
gillette
yes,
sir
there
is.
first
of
all,
there's
the
statutory
scheme,
which
sets
forth
to
the
minimum
fee
and
that's
usually
the
maximum
fee
as
it
turns
out.
that's
usually
the
fee
paid.
in
extraordinary
cases,
the
judge
will
upon
a
proper
showing
by
affidavit
from
the
attorney,
grant
certain
additional
amounts,
but
it
is
rare
that
he
does
this.
mr.
gillette
that's
right.
the
statute
itemized
is
the
various
dispositions
that
may
be
made
and
sets
forth
the
fees
that
are
to
be
paid
in
this
case,
they
are
very
low.
it
would
be
hard
to
make
a
living
out
of
it
at
least.
mr.
gillette
the
peculiarity
of
multnomah
county
is
they
wouldn't
talk
to
me.
they
said,
yes
we
are
doing
it
but
we
don't
have
the
statistics
and
we
are
too
busy
to
give
them
to
you.
mr.
gillette
that's
right,
that's
portland.
mr.
gillette
my
experience
has
been
that,
that
at
least
is
their
judgment.
yes,
sir.
mr.
gillette
that's
right;
that's
right.
i
should
have
explained
that
i
think
in
the
addendum.
mr.
gillette
that's
right.
we
got
an
answer
specifically
to
that
question.
mr.
gillette
no,
$9220
was
the
total
amount
collected
in
clackamas
county,
which
is
a
bedroom
county
adjacent
to
multnomah
county
based
upon
i
think
30
or
40
individuals
paying.
and
that
was
the
largest
amount
that
was
reported
to
us.
we
necessarily
conducted
the
survey
over
a
brief
period
of
time.
i
suspect
however
this
case
turns
out
in
oregon
law
review,
we'll
finally
find
out
what
true
facts
are
as
published
in
article
i.
mr.
gillette
it's
been
going
on
sporadically
for
perhaps
for
the
last
eight
or
ten
years;
it's
rare.
mr.
gillette
i
think
it
was
passed
in
1961.
but
the
practice
has
been
relatively
rare,
because
as
i
say
while
the
judges
may
not
uniformly
follow
the
fuller
interpretation
which
was
placed
on
the
statute
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
may
not
have
always
limited
themselves
to
those
individuals,
who
in
fact
really
weren't
indigent
in
making
the
requirement.
at
least
now,
where
the
court
of
appeals
has
affirmatively
said
that
it
is
what
they
must
find,
but
the
matter
really
isn't
indigent.
and
that
he
can
make
the
payment
without
hardship,
either
to
himself
or
his
family,
the
amount
of
privilege
is
going
to
be
limited.
mr.
gillette
i
don't
know.
i
wasn't
at
all
involved
in
the
matter
at
that
time
and
i
have
no
idea
what
they
had
in
mind.
mr.
gillette
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
believe
that
if
the
statute
could
not
survive
constitutional
muster
under
this
construction,
you
could
not
write
one
provided
for
recoupment.
so
we
believe,
i
hesitate
to
make
a
statement
as
quite
that
hyperbolic,
but
i
think
it
comes
close
to
that.
the
court
was
concerned
to
say
what
was
being
done
and
so
they
limited
as
much
as
they
could
in
examining
this
court's
decision
in
rinaldi
versus
yeager
and
in
the
strange
case.
it
was
clear
that
this
court
was
going
to
examine
not
just
the
face
of
the
statute,
but
the
way
it
was
applied
and
so
the
court
wanted
to
be
sure,
absolutely
sure
that
the
formula
of
words
utilized
in
the
statute
wasn't
just
given
a
lip
service.
that
in
fact,
the
person
who
was
required
to
make
these
payments
was
affirmatively
not
indigent,
in
fact
was
capable
of
making
the
payments
and
in
fact
even
saying
that
he
is
not
indigent,
maybe
inaccurate
because
whatever
indigency
is,
the
ability
to
make
a
payment
without
hardship
to
oneself
or
one's
family
is
probably
a
financial
condition,
better
than
not
being
indigent.
mr.
gillette
no,
i
have
not
had
the
opportunity
to
find
out.
this
is
the
one
record
i
have
seen
on
the
question.
i
have
encountered
one
case
under
an
older
statute
where
with
regards
to
something
mr.
kuhn
said,
where
the
statute
provided
that
a
losing
appellant
would
have
cost
on
appeal
assessed
against
him.
we
had
a
situation
there,
where
an
individual
had
cost
assessed
against
him
and
what
appeared
to
be
an
unfair
situation.
that
statute
was
never
challenge
and
frankly,
i
think
was
unconstitutional
because
it
applied
to
individuals
who
obviously
couldn't
have
paid
and
in
fact
were
incarcerated,
but
the
legislature
had
the
good
sense
to
repeal
it
before
we
were
faced
as
trying
to
come
up
with
the
construction
that
would
have
saved
it.
and
the
particular
case,
gave
rise
to
this
information,
which
occurred
about
a
month
ago.
i
think
we
got
resolved,
by
simply
pointing
out
that
it
wasn't
there.
but
i
have
not
had
an
opportunity
to
see
a
hearing
under
this
new
procedure.
i
don't
think
there
are
going
to
be
very
many.
this
condition
is
rarely
imposed
in
the
--
mr.
gillette
no.
i
don't
think
there
are
going
to
be
many
hearings.
at
least
with
regard
to
revocation
under
this
situation
because
in
some
respects
this
is
the
easiest
condition
to
meet.
if
an
individual
is
really
determined
to
survive
on
probation,
rather
than
have
it
revoked
he
is
going
to
meet
this
if
anything.
it
is
the
easiest
affirmative
index
to
give
to
the
court
that
he
is
meeting
the
terms
of
probation.
and
so
we're
confident
that
it's
going
to
work
in
those
few
instances
in
which
it
applies.
now,
justice
rehnquist
asked
about
sanctions
and
the
answer
to
that,
i
think
was
fairly
well
heard.
the
sanction
is
contempt
and
the
sanction
applies
not
just
to
individuals
placed
on
probation,
the
sanction
speaks
to
all
convicted
individuals
who
have
this
condition
imposed
upon
them.
and
mr.
kuhn
has
suggested
this
has
never
happened
with
respect
to
a
penitentiary
inmate.
we
have
no
statistics
to
show
that
one
way
or
another.
practically
speaking,
however,
i
suspect
that's
true,
not
because
the
courts
as
a
matter
of
practice
are
trying
to
distinguish
between
those
who
are
placed
on
probation
and
those
who
are
not,
but
simply
because
people
who
go
to
jail
by
and
large
have
even
less
chance
to
improve
upon
their
original
condition
of
indigency
than
to
those
who
remain
outside.
and
in
fact,
one
of
the
reasons
sometimes
that
an
individual
is
granted
probation
in
addition
to
other
considerations
is
the
fact
that
he's
got
a
job
and
he
is
maintaining
the
job
and
he
is
caring
for
his
family
and
he
showed
another
ways
that
he
is
a
contributing
citizen,
whatever
his
particular
offense
may
have
been.
so
i
think
the
reasons
for
that
distinction
if
in
fact
they
are
accurately
portrayed,
and
i
am
willing
to
concede
that
they
probably
are,
are
reasons
which
arises
out
of
the
particular
concern
involved,
and
there's
really
no
way
ever
to
get
around
that
kind
of
problem.
mr.
gillette
i
am
not
sure
i
can
say
--
i
follow
that,
i
am
not
sure
i
can
say
it
will
arise
in
all
the
cases
that
limited
but
they
would
be
nearly
so
limited,
simply
because
of
the
nature
the
condition
that
the
fuller
decision
places
on
imposing
on
that
requirement.
part
of
the
reason,
i
hesitate
on
that
is
because
judges
rarely
in
oregon
want
to
listen
to
any
recommendation
with
regard
to
sentence
and
that
is
not
part
of
plea
negotiations
normally,
with
the
exception
of
one
county.
da's
don't
make
such
recommendations
and
judges
wouldn't
listen
if
they
did,
regarding
that
is
their
province
and
not
the
district
attorney's.
mr.
gillette
that
happens,
they
tried.
now
with
regard,
if
i
may
to
the
permit
of
equal
protection
question,
counsel
has
urged
this
court
as
it
was
urged
upon
the
oregon
court,
that
james
versus
strange
is
applicable
here,
because
the
oregon
statute
just
like
the
kansas
statute
in
some
way
affirmatively
denies
to
individuals
subjected
to
this
condition.
those
exemptions
which
are
granted
to
other
judgment
debtors
in
fact
this
isn't
so.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
specifically
says
that
it
isn't
so.
it
says
these
people
are
entitled
to
the
same
exemptions
everybody
else
is.
i
have
set
forth
the
statutory
scheme
in
my
brief
and
i
think
it
shows
that
those
exemptions
are
afforded
in
the
same
way
they
are
afforded
to
every
other
judgment
debtor.
so
i
would
submit
if
that
ground
in
james
versus
strange
was
the
full
reason
this
court
felt
constrained
to
strike
that
statute,
then
james
versus
strange
is
just
not
the
point
at
all
in
this
legislation.
now,
i
see
from
my
notes
that
i
have
covered
the
other
particular
point
that
i
wanted
to
mention
to
the
court.
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
other
questions
i
am
done.
