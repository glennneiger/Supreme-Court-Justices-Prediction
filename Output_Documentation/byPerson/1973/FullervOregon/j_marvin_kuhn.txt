mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
the
charge
of
sodomy
in
multnomah
county,
was
placed
on
a
term
of
five
years
probation
and
as
a
condition
of
the
probation
he
was
ordered
to
reimburse
the
county
for
the
cost
of
his
court-appointed
attorney
fees
as
well
as
the
total
of
$375.00
for
the
cost
of
the
investigator
hired
by
his
court-appointed
attorney.
the
petitioner
believes
that
these
conditions
of
probation,
of
reimbursement
deny
him
due
process
as
well
as
equal
protection,
and
are
an
impermissible
burden
upon
his
right
to
counsel
as
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
now,
petitioner
believes
that
this
condition
of
probation,
that
he
repay
his
court-appointed
attorneys
fees
are
an
impediment
to
the
free
exercise
of
his
right
to
counsel
as
guaranteed
by
this
court
in
gideon
versus
wainwright
and
recently
reinforced
in
argersinger
versus
hamlin.
the
oregon
practice
which
is
beginning
now,
this
is
one
of
the
first
cases
will
have
the
effect
of
placing
a
financial
penalty
upon
those
indigents
who
need
legal
help,
but
cannot
afford
to
retain
their
own
counsels.
now
this
issue
recently
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
in
the
case
of
in
re
allen.
now,
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
the
same
type
condition
of
probation
as
we
have
here
was
unconstitutional,
because
it
would
place
an
impermissible
burden
upon
the
petitioner's
right
to
counsel
in
that
case.
the
california
court
reasoned
that
even
though
there
was
no
indication
there
that
the
petitioner
had
been
denied
her
right
to
counsel,
since
she
actually
was
represented
by
court-appointed
counsel
that
the
record
did
not
show
that
she
was
ever
advised
of
this
potential
liability
as
to
the
repayment
and
reimbursement
to
the
county
for
the
cost
of
this
counsel.
petitioner
submits
that
such
advice
is
also
absent
in
the
present
record
that
we
have
here.
the
california
court
also
felt
that
if
the
petitioner
had
had
knowledge
that
she
may
have
to
repay
the
cost
of
her
court-appointed
counsel
and
as
the
knowledge
of
this
potential
burdens
spreads
that
it
could
very
well
chill
future
indigents
from
exercising
their
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
rather
than
risking
having
to
repay
them
as
a
condition
of
the
probation
should
they
be
fortunate
enough
to
receive
probation.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
our
record
has
none
at
all.
there
was
the
defendant
or
the
petitioner
in
this
case
while
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
he
was
ever
advised
that
he
would
have
to
repay
counsel
until
such
time
has
the
conditions
of
probation
were
imposed
at
the
sentencing.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
this
was
in
the
allen
case.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
it
was
and
it
was
based
upon
that,
that
it
would
be
a
chilling
effect.
there
was
--
i
saw
no
empirical
evidence
in
the
allen
case,
indicating
that
this
would
be
so,
but
they
did
had
the
feeling
that
under
california
practice,
such
would
be
the
case.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
a
counsel
can
be
waived
your
honor,
yes.
assuming
there
is
full
advice
as
to
the
right
to
counsel,
counsel
may
be
waived.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
no,
i
do
not
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
case
is
--
the
gideon
case
and
the
all
the
subsequent
cases
indicate
that
if
a
man
cannot
afford
counsel
in
that
case
where
the
man
has
indicated,
he
does
have
sufficient
funds
to
retain
counsel,
but
he
will
not
do
it
and
i
do
not
believe
the
constitution
requires
counsel
to
be
able
to
appoint
it
for
him.
i
believe
that
the
thrust
of
gideon
argersinger
are
to
the
effect
that
an
indigent,
a
man
who
cannot
afford
counsel
or
where
it
would
work
a
hardship
upon
him
has
a
right
to
appointed
counsel,
but
under
no
other
conditions.
now
it's
this
chilling
effect,
the
possible
limiting
of
the
right
to
counsel
that
the
petitioner
believes
is
at
issue
here
and
is
the
main
issue.
now,
this
is
assuming
that
he
is
told
by
the
court,
prior
to
appointment
of
counsel
that
should
he
be
convicted
and
placed
on
probation,
that
he
perhaps
may
have
this
obligation
to
repay
the
cost
of
court-appointed
counsel.
this
is
one
provision
that
is
not
currently
done
in
oregon
practice
today.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
believe
that
without
the
statute
under
the
decisions
of
oregon,
i
believe
it
could
as
an
inherent
power
of
the
sentencing
court.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
it's
my
opinion
that
should
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
as
long
as
the
petitioner
or
defendant
is
subject
to
the
criminal
statutes
of
repayment
as
a
condition
of
probation
that
in
order
to
fully
ensure
an
understanding
as
to
his
right
to
counsel,
that
at
the
time
the
court
must
inform
him
of
this
possible
liability.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
oh!
i
am
sorry.
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
meant
whether
oregon
has
statute
that
specifically
allowed
this
as
a
condition
of
probation.
i
do
believe
that
the
court
could
impose
this
condition,
without
such
a
statute
in
oregon.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
my
answer
is
the
same.
if
the
indigent
appears
without
counsel
and
at
the
time
advice
of
counsel
is
given,
this
possibility
should
be
explained
to
him.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
that
is
our
position,
yes.
however,
i
believe
that
even
if
counsel,
if
it
is
explained
to
him
that
the
condition
itself
is
an
impediment
to
the
free
exercise
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
it's
--
this
is
--
perhaps,
this
is
the
first
case
i
have
heard
about
in
oregon,
you
honor,
this
one
here.
subsequent
to
this,
i
am
aware
of
the
practice
being
carried
on
in
washington
county,
oregon
and
in
lane
county,
oregon
as
to
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
not
in
every
case.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
that
i
am
not
clear
on
it.
i
would
assume
it
is
on
the
--
depending
upon
each
individual
defendant
that
appears
before
the
court
at
the
time
of
sentencing
and
to
great
amount
to
as
to
what
appears
in
pre-sentence
report.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
that's
correct
and
within
the
same
county.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
in
addition
to
counsel,
i
believe
that
the
statute
is
worded
to
the
effect
that
costs
cannot
include,
those
costs
that
are
inherent
in
affording
the
defendant,
his
right
to
jury
trial
such
as
subpoenas,
jury
fees,
fees
and
cost
of
the
district
attorney
are
not
included.
it's
more
of
a
statute
of
exclusion
i
believe
rather
than
inclusion.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
it
could
be
the
possible
cost
your
honor,
if
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
--
the
experts,
investigators,
are
hired
such
as
here,
as
judge
fort
pointed
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion.
the
defendant
may
very
well
become
liable
for
that
also.
in
response
to
the
former
question,
this
is
case
in
douglas
county.
now,
as
to
the
cost
of
the
psychiatrist,
the
cost
of
the
investigator,
these
may
all
become
conditions
of
reimbursement
and
made
a
condition
of
probation.
now,
the
possibility
of
this
chilling
effect,
i
believe
that
the
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
not
as
to
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
believe
for
such
as
that
--
it
may
be
an
impingement
on
his
right
to
jury
trial.
it's
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
if
the
defendant
has
obtained
these
witnesses
in
order
to
present
a
complete
defense
then
i
believe
that
it
would
impinge
on
his
right
to
trial
by
jury.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
believe
it
would
be
the
same,
since
the
right
to
trial
by
jury,
as
i
understand
it,
includes
the
right
to
put
on
a
defense,
whether
or
not
is
before
the
court
who
becomes
the
trier
of
fact.
now,
it
is
this
possible
chilling
effect
here
that
i
believe
that
the
oregon
court's
opinion
did
not
recognize.
as
the
court
held
that
the
defendant
is
given
counsel
when
he
needs
it,
but
petitioner
believes
this
does
not
answer
the
question,
since
it
is
the
possible
chilling
effect
and
of
those
possible
indigents
who
just
won't
accept
counsel
if
they
are
made
aware
of
the
fact
that
they
may
have
to
repay
the
county
and
then
this
repayment
then
becomes
a
condition
of
probation.
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
indicated
in
the
concurring
opinion
argersinger
versus
hamlin,
representation
by
counsel
is
desirable
at
criminal
cases
from
both
the
viewpoint
of
the
defendant
and
society.
so
the
defendant
would
submit
here
that
the
oregon
practice
injures
not
only
the
particular
indigent
facing
the
criminal
trial
of
which
he
is
presumed
to
be
innocent,
but
of
society
as
a
whole,
because
if
such
a
condition
as
we
believe
it
does,
discourages
counsel
to
those
who
need
it
most
when
they
need
it,
the
entire
judicial
framework
within
which
society
lives,
defendant
believes
is
wicked.
now,
this
possible
chilling
effect
was
noted
by
the
american
bar
association
project
on
providing
defense
services
in
which
they
pointed
out
that
the
practice
would
discourage
the
acceptance
of
counsel
and
their
opinions
and
recommended
that
reimbursement
for
providing
counsel
should
not
be
required
except
on
the
ground
where
fraud
is
used
in
obtaining
court-appointed
counsel
or
in
presenting
indigency
to
the
court.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
the
recoupment
statute
indicates
that
he
may
be
cited
for
contempt.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
now
in
a
contempt
hearing,
i
believe
that
would
be
a
defense.
however,
here
where
it
is
a
condition
of
probation
under
the
oregon
statute
137.550,
when
it
is
made
a
condition
of
probation,
he
does
place
the
possibility
of
being
sent
to
prison
for
the
failure
to
pay.
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion,
majority
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor,
as
he
did
not
live
up
to
the
term
of
probation
of
repayment,
he
therefore
may
have
his
probation
revoked
and
be
sent
to
prison.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
in
the
opinion
in
this
case
indicated
that
pursuant
to
the
statute,
a
defendant
may
not
be
revoked
unless
the
court
finds
he
is
unable
to
pay
and
that
he
did
not
pay
as
a
result
of
an
intentional
contumacious
default.
in
other
words
or
that
--
if
the
court
finds
he
had
the
ability
to
pay
and
didn't
pay
intentionally,
then
he
could
be
revoked,
without
those
two
findings
according
to
the
majority
opinion,
he
cannot
be
revoked.
however
the
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
no,
your
honor,
as
to
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe,
but
however
that
is
this
case,
that
was
the
majority
opinion
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
believe
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
believe
it
is.
it's
the
risk,
your
honor,
as
to
trying
to
separate
the
revocation
from
the
original
advice
as
to
the
rights
of
counsel.
in
the
initial
stages,
the
damaging
part
of
this
condition
of
probation
in
my
opinion,
is
that
at
the
time
even
if
an
indigent
felt
he
may
incur
another
debt.
now,
that
maybe
all
he
is
and
at
that
time
if
he
says
--
if
he
believes
in
his
own
mind
that
this
is
going
to
burden
me
with
another
debt
that
i
may
have
to
pay
on
time
and
because
of
that
if
he
then
gives
up
his
right
to
counsel
then
this
is
the
chilling
effect,
and
this
i
believe
is
the
infringement
on
the
constitutional
right.
it's
the
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
personally
experienced
for
one
thing,
your
honor.
i
have
had
this
occur
on
appeals
at
one
time
on
many
occasions.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
the
penitentiary
inmates
at
one
time,
prior
to
this
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
no,
they
wish
to
appeal
until
they
were
--
and
we
felt
that
we
had
to
advise
them
that
at
the
time,
subsequent
to
the
inclusion
of
the
appeal
that
we
would
file
a
cost
bill,
as
to
our
costs
and
pursuant
to
the
oregon
law
that
it
would
then
perhaps
could
become
a
lien
and
they
would
be
required
to
pay
and
they
had
given
up
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
quite
a
few.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
now
although
this
court
did
not
reach
this
issue
in
james
versus
strange,
it
has
held
that
an
individual
cannot
be
penalized
for
exercising
a
constitutional
right
and
penalty
as
defined
by
malloy
versus
hogan
as
any
sanction
that
makes
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
costly
and
the
petitioner
submits
that
this
would
be
very
costly
and
one
of
the
most
costly
things,
i
could
think
of,
if
he
did
waive
the
right
to
counsel
in
order
to
avoid
further
debt.
the
court
has
protected
the
fifth
amendment
right
in
united
states
versus
jackson,
garner
versus
broderick,
and
sanitation
men
association
versus
the
commissioner.
the
latter
case
is
holding
that
the
petitioners
could
not
be
dismissed
from
their
positions
for
asserting
their
fifth
amendment
rights
against
self-incrimination.
we
submit
that
the
right
to
counsel
is
as
fundamental,
a
constitutional
right
as
a
right
to
silence
protected
under
her
fifth
amendment.
now,
i
think
the
position
was
extinctly
stated
by
judge
fort
who
dissented
in
the
instant
case,
when
he
indicated
that
if
an
accused
is
represented
by
court-appointed
counsel
and
does
avail
himself
of
the
procedure,
such
as
calling
witnesses,
or
calling
an
investigator,
or
other
experts,
who
was
in
a
defense
and
loses,
he
faces
a
double
prospect
for
having
in
good
faith
utilized
the
adversary
system
of
repayment
of
a
debt
and
a
possible
imprisonment
for
failure
to
repay.
now,
the
petitioner
also
submits
that
the
condition
of
probation
denies
him
equal
protection.
the
oregon
court
distinguished
the
oregon
recoupment
statutes
from
the
one
condemned
in
james
versus
strange
because
the
oregon
statute
did
not
contain
within
it
a
denial
of
the
exemptions
from
execution
afforded
to
other
judgment
debtors.
however,
as
judge
fort
indicated
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
there
is
nothing
to
support
such
a
construction
as
there
is
nothing
in
ors
161.675,
paragraph
2
or
ors
137.550
that
affords
a
defendant
in
a
revocation
proceeding
the
same
exemptions
provided
in
other
oregon
judgment
debtors
as
appears
in
chapter
23
of
the
oregon
revised
statutes.
for
this
reason,
judge
fort
and
petitioner
believes
that
the
oregon
statute
is
essentially
no
different
from
that
statute
condemned
in
james
versus
strange.
another
difference
is
that
the
kansas
statute
was
civil
in
nature,
the
oregon
statute
as
applied
as
a
condition
of
probation
is
part
of
the
criminal
procedure
and
that
as
in
effect
of
this,
that
an
indigent
whose
probation
is
revoked
is
in
effect
being
punished
for
a
debt
owed
to
the
state.
and
it
does
create
a
gulf
between
the
man
with
money
and
a
man
without.
now,
even
though
the
court
of
appeals
did
hold
that
a
probationer
in
oregon
could
not
be
imprisoned
for
the
failure
to
pay,
unless
the
default
was
intentional,
the
court
when
it
made
that
statement
did
not
attempt
to
distinguish
the
oregon
statute
from
the
kansas
statute
there
as
nothing
was
said
about
the
petitioner
being
able
to
claim
his
exemptions
in
a
revocation
hearing,
the
same
as
other
judgment
debtors
are
allowed
to
do
so
in
oregon
in
civil
proceedings
against
them.
now
for
this
reason,
petitioner
believes
that
oregon
law
discriminates
against
those
convicted
indigent
defendants
who
are
placed
on
probation.
now,
it
does
not
apply
to
any
of
the
other
convicted
indigents
who
are
sentenced
to
the
penitentiary.
and
for
this
reason,
petitioner
submits
that
it
does
not
make
sense
to
carve
a
class
out
of
a
class,
such
as
convicted
indigents
to
carve
out
of
that
class,
a
class
of
convicted
indigents
who
are
put
on
probation
and
apply
the
condition
and
requirement
that
they
repay
against
them
only,
when
as
a
matter
of
practice
have
been
unable
to
find
any
case
where
a
man
sentenced
to
the
penitentiary
has
in
fact
been
sentenced
to
pay
and
required
to
pay
the
cost
of
his
court-appointed
attorney.
so
although
he
is
assessed
other
costs,
--
i
have
no
found
no
case
that
indicates
he
has
been
required
to
repay
he
cost
of
his
court-appointed
attorneys
fees
as
only
probationers
are
now
required
to
do
in
oregon.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
i
believe
that's
the
reasons.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
i
believe
there
is
a
difference
between
reparation
to
the
victim.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes
they
may,
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
under
our
statute,
it
does
indicate
without
the
recoupment
statute,
i
believe
that
the
court
would
still
be
authorized
to
impose
such
a
condition
of
probation.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
believe
they
would
be.
i
believe
that
this
would
be
inherent
in
the
power
of
the
courts.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
assuming
it
was
not
a
burden.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor,
that's
the
main
issue
i
believe
here
is,
whether
or
not
this
condition
of
probation
is
valid.
it's
our
main
position
actually
that
it
is
not
because
it
is
unnecessary
infringement
upon
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
nothing
further,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
the
charge
of
sodomy
in
multnomah
county,
was
placed
on
a
term
of
five
years
probation
and
as
a
condition
of
the
probation
he
was
ordered
to
reimburse
the
county
for
the
cost
of
his
court-appointed
attorney
fees
as
well
as
the
total
of
$375.00
for
the
cost
of
the
investigator
hired
by
his
court-appointed
attorney.
the
petitioner
believes
that
these
conditions
of
probation,
of
reimbursement
deny
him
due
process
as
well
as
equal
protection,
and
are
an
impermissible
burden
upon
his
right
to
counsel
as
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
now,
petitioner
believes
that
this
condition
of
probation,
that
he
repay
his
court-appointed
attorneys
fees
are
an
impediment
to
the
free
exercise
of
his
right
to
counsel
as
guaranteed
by
this
court
in
gideon
versus
wainwright
and
recently
reinforced
in
argersinger
versus
hamlin.
the
oregon
practice
which
is
beginning
now,
this
is
one
of
the
first
cases
will
have
the
effect
of
placing
a
financial
penalty
upon
those
indigents
who
need
legal
help,
but
cannot
afford
to
retain
their
own
counsels.
now
this
issue
recently
was
decided
by
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
in
the
case
of
in
re
allen.
now,
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
the
same
type
condition
of
probation
as
we
have
here
was
unconstitutional,
because
it
would
place
an
impermissible
burden
upon
the
petitioner's
right
to
counsel
in
that
case.
the
california
court
reasoned
that
even
though
there
was
no
indication
there
that
the
petitioner
had
been
denied
her
right
to
counsel,
since
she
actually
was
represented
by
court-appointed
counsel
that
the
record
did
not
show
that
she
was
ever
advised
of
this
potential
liability
as
to
the
repayment
and
reimbursement
to
the
county
for
the
cost
of
this
counsel.
petitioner
submits
that
such
advice
is
also
absent
in
the
present
record
that
we
have
here.
the
california
court
also
felt
that
if
the
petitioner
had
had
knowledge
that
she
may
have
to
repay
the
cost
of
her
court-appointed
counsel
and
as
the
knowledge
of
this
potential
burdens
spreads
that
it
could
very
well
chill
future
indigents
from
exercising
their
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
rather
than
risking
having
to
repay
them
as
a
condition
of
the
probation
should
they
be
fortunate
enough
to
receive
probation.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
our
record
has
none
at
all.
there
was
the
defendant
or
the
petitioner
in
this
case
while
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
he
was
ever
advised
that
he
would
have
to
repay
counsel
until
such
time
has
the
conditions
of
probation
were
imposed
at
the
sentencing.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
this
was
in
the
allen
case.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
it
was
and
it
was
based
upon
that,
that
it
would
be
a
chilling
effect.
there
was
--
i
saw
no
empirical
evidence
in
the
allen
case,
indicating
that
this
would
be
so,
but
they
did
had
the
feeling
that
under
california
practice,
such
would
be
the
case.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
a
counsel
can
be
waived
your
honor,
yes.
assuming
there
is
full
advice
as
to
the
right
to
counsel,
counsel
may
be
waived.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
no,
i
do
not
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
case
is
--
the
gideon
case
and
the
all
the
subsequent
cases
indicate
that
if
a
man
cannot
afford
counsel
in
that
case
where
the
man
has
indicated,
he
does
have
sufficient
funds
to
retain
counsel,
but
he
will
not
do
it
and
i
do
not
believe
the
constitution
requires
counsel
to
be
able
to
appoint
it
for
him.
i
believe
that
the
thrust
of
gideon
argersinger
are
to
the
effect
that
an
indigent,
a
man
who
cannot
afford
counsel
or
where
it
would
work
a
hardship
upon
him
has
a
right
to
appointed
counsel,
but
under
no
other
conditions.
now
it's
this
chilling
effect,
the
possible
limiting
of
the
right
to
counsel
that
the
petitioner
believes
is
at
issue
here
and
is
the
main
issue.
now,
this
is
assuming
that
he
is
told
by
the
court,
prior
to
appointment
of
counsel
that
should
he
be
convicted
and
placed
on
probation,
that
he
perhaps
may
have
this
obligation
to
repay
the
cost
of
court-appointed
counsel.
this
is
one
provision
that
is
not
currently
done
in
oregon
practice
today.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
believe
that
without
the
statute
under
the
decisions
of
oregon,
i
believe
it
could
as
an
inherent
power
of
the
sentencing
court.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
it's
my
opinion
that
should
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
as
long
as
the
petitioner
or
defendant
is
subject
to
the
criminal
statutes
of
repayment
as
a
condition
of
probation
that
in
order
to
fully
ensure
an
understanding
as
to
his
right
to
counsel,
that
at
the
time
the
court
must
inform
him
of
this
possible
liability.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
oh!
i
am
sorry.
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
meant
whether
oregon
has
statute
that
specifically
allowed
this
as
a
condition
of
probation.
i
do
believe
that
the
court
could
impose
this
condition,
without
such
a
statute
in
oregon.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
my
answer
is
the
same.
if
the
indigent
appears
without
counsel
and
at
the
time
advice
of
counsel
is
given,
this
possibility
should
be
explained
to
him.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
that
is
our
position,
yes.
however,
i
believe
that
even
if
counsel,
if
it
is
explained
to
him
that
the
condition
itself
is
an
impediment
to
the
free
exercise
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
it's
--
this
is
--
perhaps,
this
is
the
first
case
i
have
heard
about
in
oregon,
you
honor,
this
one
here.
subsequent
to
this,
i
am
aware
of
the
practice
being
carried
on
in
washington
county,
oregon
and
in
lane
county,
oregon
as
to
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
not
in
every
case.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
that
i
am
not
clear
on
it.
i
would
assume
it
is
on
the
--
depending
upon
each
individual
defendant
that
appears
before
the
court
at
the
time
of
sentencing
and
to
great
amount
to
as
to
what
appears
in
pre-sentence
report.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
it
does
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
that's
correct
and
within
the
same
county.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
in
addition
to
counsel,
i
believe
that
the
statute
is
worded
to
the
effect
that
costs
cannot
include,
those
costs
that
are
inherent
in
affording
the
defendant,
his
right
to
jury
trial
such
as
subpoenas,
jury
fees,
fees
and
cost
of
the
district
attorney
are
not
included.
it's
more
of
a
statute
of
exclusion
i
believe
rather
than
inclusion.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
it
could
be
the
possible
cost
your
honor,
if
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
--
the
experts,
investigators,
are
hired
such
as
here,
as
judge
fort
pointed
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion.
the
defendant
may
very
well
become
liable
for
that
also.
in
response
to
the
former
question,
this
is
case
in
douglas
county.
now,
as
to
the
cost
of
the
psychiatrist,
the
cost
of
the
investigator,
these
may
all
become
conditions
of
reimbursement
and
made
a
condition
of
probation.
now,
the
possibility
of
this
chilling
effect,
i
believe
that
the
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
not
as
to
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
believe
for
such
as
that
--
it
may
be
an
impingement
on
his
right
to
jury
trial.
it's
guaranteed
by
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
if
the
defendant
has
obtained
these
witnesses
in
order
to
present
a
complete
defense
then
i
believe
that
it
would
impinge
on
his
right
to
trial
by
jury.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
believe
it
would
be
the
same,
since
the
right
to
trial
by
jury,
as
i
understand
it,
includes
the
right
to
put
on
a
defense,
whether
or
not
is
before
the
court
who
becomes
the
trier
of
fact.
now,
it
is
this
possible
chilling
effect
here
that
i
believe
that
the
oregon
court's
opinion
did
not
recognize.
as
the
court
held
that
the
defendant
is
given
counsel
when
he
needs
it,
but
petitioner
believes
this
does
not
answer
the
question,
since
it
is
the
possible
chilling
effect
and
of
those
possible
indigents
who
just
won't
accept
counsel
if
they
are
made
aware
of
the
fact
that
they
may
have
to
repay
the
county
and
then
this
repayment
then
becomes
a
condition
of
probation.
as
mr.
chief
justice
burger
indicated
in
the
concurring
opinion
argersinger
versus
hamlin,
representation
by
counsel
is
desirable
at
criminal
cases
from
both
the
viewpoint
of
the
defendant
and
society.
so
the
defendant
would
submit
here
that
the
oregon
practice
injures
not
only
the
particular
indigent
facing
the
criminal
trial
of
which
he
is
presumed
to
be
innocent,
but
of
society
as
a
whole,
because
if
such
a
condition
as
we
believe
it
does,
discourages
counsel
to
those
who
need
it
most
when
they
need
it,
the
entire
judicial
framework
within
which
society
lives,
defendant
believes
is
wicked.
now,
this
possible
chilling
effect
was
noted
by
the
american
bar
association
project
on
providing
defense
services
in
which
they
pointed
out
that
the
practice
would
discourage
the
acceptance
of
counsel
and
their
opinions
and
recommended
that
reimbursement
for
providing
counsel
should
not
be
required
except
on
the
ground
where
fraud
is
used
in
obtaining
court-appointed
counsel
or
in
presenting
indigency
to
the
court.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
the
recoupment
statute
indicates
that
he
may
be
cited
for
contempt.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
now
in
a
contempt
hearing,
i
believe
that
would
be
a
defense.
however,
here
where
it
is
a
condition
of
probation
under
the
oregon
statute
137.550,
when
it
is
made
a
condition
of
probation,
he
does
place
the
possibility
of
being
sent
to
prison
for
the
failure
to
pay.
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
in
its
opinion,
majority
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
beg
your
pardon
your
honor?
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor,
as
he
did
not
live
up
to
the
term
of
probation
of
repayment,
he
therefore
may
have
his
probation
revoked
and
be
sent
to
prison.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
in
the
opinion
in
this
case
indicated
that
pursuant
to
the
statute,
a
defendant
may
not
be
revoked
unless
the
court
finds
he
is
unable
to
pay
and
that
he
did
not
pay
as
a
result
of
an
intentional
contumacious
default.
in
other
words
or
that
--
if
the
court
finds
he
had
the
ability
to
pay
and
didn't
pay
intentionally,
then
he
could
be
revoked,
without
those
two
findings
according
to
the
majority
opinion,
he
cannot
be
revoked.
however
the
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
no,
your
honor,
as
to
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe,
but
however
that
is
this
case,
that
was
the
majority
opinion
in
this
case.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
believe
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
believe
it
is.
it's
the
risk,
your
honor,
as
to
trying
to
separate
the
revocation
from
the
original
advice
as
to
the
rights
of
counsel.
in
the
initial
stages,
the
damaging
part
of
this
condition
of
probation
in
my
opinion,
is
that
at
the
time
even
if
an
indigent
felt
he
may
incur
another
debt.
now,
that
maybe
all
he
is
and
at
that
time
if
he
says
--
if
he
believes
in
his
own
mind
that
this
is
going
to
burden
me
with
another
debt
that
i
may
have
to
pay
on
time
and
because
of
that
if
he
then
gives
up
his
right
to
counsel
then
this
is
the
chilling
effect,
and
this
i
believe
is
the
infringement
on
the
constitutional
right.
it's
the
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
personally
experienced
for
one
thing,
your
honor.
i
have
had
this
occur
on
appeals
at
one
time
on
many
occasions.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
the
penitentiary
inmates
at
one
time,
prior
to
this
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
no,
they
wish
to
appeal
until
they
were
--
and
we
felt
that
we
had
to
advise
them
that
at
the
time,
subsequent
to
the
inclusion
of
the
appeal
that
we
would
file
a
cost
bill,
as
to
our
costs
and
pursuant
to
the
oregon
law
that
it
would
then
perhaps
could
become
a
lien
and
they
would
be
required
to
pay
and
they
had
given
up
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
quite
a
few.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
now
although
this
court
did
not
reach
this
issue
in
james
versus
strange,
it
has
held
that
an
individual
cannot
be
penalized
for
exercising
a
constitutional
right
and
penalty
as
defined
by
malloy
versus
hogan
as
any
sanction
that
makes
the
assertion
of
the
privilege
costly
and
the
petitioner
submits
that
this
would
be
very
costly
and
one
of
the
most
costly
things,
i
could
think
of,
if
he
did
waive
the
right
to
counsel
in
order
to
avoid
further
debt.
the
court
has
protected
the
fifth
amendment
right
in
united
states
versus
jackson,
garner
versus
broderick,
and
sanitation
men
association
versus
the
commissioner.
the
latter
case
is
holding
that
the
petitioners
could
not
be
dismissed
from
their
positions
for
asserting
their
fifth
amendment
rights
against
self-incrimination.
we
submit
that
the
right
to
counsel
is
as
fundamental,
a
constitutional
right
as
a
right
to
silence
protected
under
her
fifth
amendment.
now,
i
think
the
position
was
extinctly
stated
by
judge
fort
who
dissented
in
the
instant
case,
when
he
indicated
that
if
an
accused
is
represented
by
court-appointed
counsel
and
does
avail
himself
of
the
procedure,
such
as
calling
witnesses,
or
calling
an
investigator,
or
other
experts,
who
was
in
a
defense
and
loses,
he
faces
a
double
prospect
for
having
in
good
faith
utilized
the
adversary
system
of
repayment
of
a
debt
and
a
possible
imprisonment
for
failure
to
repay.
now,
the
petitioner
also
submits
that
the
condition
of
probation
denies
him
equal
protection.
the
oregon
court
distinguished
the
oregon
recoupment
statutes
from
the
one
condemned
in
james
versus
strange
because
the
oregon
statute
did
not
contain
within
it
a
denial
of
the
exemptions
from
execution
afforded
to
other
judgment
debtors.
however,
as
judge
fort
indicated
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
there
is
nothing
to
support
such
a
construction
as
there
is
nothing
in
ors
161.675,
paragraph
2
or
ors
137.550
that
affords
a
defendant
in
a
revocation
proceeding
the
same
exemptions
provided
in
other
oregon
judgment
debtors
as
appears
in
chapter
23
of
the
oregon
revised
statutes.
for
this
reason,
judge
fort
and
petitioner
believes
that
the
oregon
statute
is
essentially
no
different
from
that
statute
condemned
in
james
versus
strange.
another
difference
is
that
the
kansas
statute
was
civil
in
nature,
the
oregon
statute
as
applied
as
a
condition
of
probation
is
part
of
the
criminal
procedure
and
that
as
in
effect
of
this,
that
an
indigent
whose
probation
is
revoked
is
in
effect
being
punished
for
a
debt
owed
to
the
state.
and
it
does
create
a
gulf
between
the
man
with
money
and
a
man
without.
now,
even
though
the
court
of
appeals
did
hold
that
a
probationer
in
oregon
could
not
be
imprisoned
for
the
failure
to
pay,
unless
the
default
was
intentional,
the
court
when
it
made
that
statement
did
not
attempt
to
distinguish
the
oregon
statute
from
the
kansas
statute
there
as
nothing
was
said
about
the
petitioner
being
able
to
claim
his
exemptions
in
a
revocation
hearing,
the
same
as
other
judgment
debtors
are
allowed
to
do
so
in
oregon
in
civil
proceedings
against
them.
now
for
this
reason,
petitioner
believes
that
oregon
law
discriminates
against
those
convicted
indigent
defendants
who
are
placed
on
probation.
now,
it
does
not
apply
to
any
of
the
other
convicted
indigents
who
are
sentenced
to
the
penitentiary.
and
for
this
reason,
petitioner
submits
that
it
does
not
make
sense
to
carve
a
class
out
of
a
class,
such
as
convicted
indigents
to
carve
out
of
that
class,
a
class
of
convicted
indigents
who
are
put
on
probation
and
apply
the
condition
and
requirement
that
they
repay
against
them
only,
when
as
a
matter
of
practice
have
been
unable
to
find
any
case
where
a
man
sentenced
to
the
penitentiary
has
in
fact
been
sentenced
to
pay
and
required
to
pay
the
cost
of
his
court-appointed
attorney.
so
although
he
is
assessed
other
costs,
--
i
have
no
found
no
case
that
indicates
he
has
been
required
to
repay
he
cost
of
his
court-appointed
attorneys
fees
as
only
probationers
are
now
required
to
do
in
oregon.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
i
believe
that's
the
reasons.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
there
is
your
honor.
i
believe
there
is
a
difference
between
reparation
to
the
victim.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes
they
may,
your
honor
--
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
under
our
statute,
it
does
indicate
without
the
recoupment
statute,
i
believe
that
the
court
would
still
be
authorized
to
impose
such
a
condition
of
probation.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes
your
honor.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
i
believe
they
would
be.
i
believe
that
this
would
be
inherent
in
the
power
of
the
courts.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor.
assuming
it
was
not
a
burden.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
yes,
your
honor,
that's
the
main
issue
i
believe
here
is,
whether
or
not
this
condition
of
probation
is
valid.
it's
our
main
position
actually
that
it
is
not
because
it
is
unnecessary
infringement
upon
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
j.
marvin
kuhn
nothing
further,
your
honor.
