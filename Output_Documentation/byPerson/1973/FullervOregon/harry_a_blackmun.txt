justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
the
record
have
any
empirical
data
to
that
effect
mr.
kuhn?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
was
this
speculation
on
the
part
of
the
california
court
then
in
the
allen
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
it
speculation
on
the
part
have
occurred?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
kuhn,
if
suppose
you
did
not
have
your
oregon
statute,
could
a
court
on
its
own
impose
this
is
a
condition
of
probation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
is
it
your
position
then
that
a
court
must
in
every
case
prior
to
trial
advice
counsel
that
this
is
a
possibility
as
to
what
it
might
do?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
at
least
without
the
statute
now?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
even
without
the
presence
of
your
statute?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let
me
start
all
over
again.
i
am
assuming
oregon
does
not
have
this
kind
of
a
statute
as
most
states
do
not,
then
i
thought
i
asked
you
whether
a
court
on
its
own
could
impose
this
as
a
condition
of
probation
and
i
thought
you
said
yes?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
my
next
question
was,
then
must
the
court
in
every
criminal
case
so
advice
the
defendant?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
if
he
does
not,
then
the
condition
may
not
be
imposed?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
because
they
canceled
probation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
because

canceled

justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
you're
not
making
the
zero
under
the
number
of
individuals
personally
making
payment,
and
it
only
means
that
you
do
not
know
the
answer.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
at
least
one
other
place
you
do
have
a
zero
which
i
take
it
is
a
positive
answer.
