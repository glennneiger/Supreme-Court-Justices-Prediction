justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lucas,
before
you
go
any
further,
my
understanding
of
the
procedural
history
of
the
case
may
be
a
little
bit
different
to
yours.
let
me
check
it
with
you.
as
i
understand,
the
north
dakota
district
court,
your
trial
court,
gave
summary
judgment
for
snyder’s.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
was
on
the
basis
that
the
constitutional
provision
that
the
north
dakota
law
violated
the
constitutional
provision
and
that
the
pharmacy
board’s
conclusion
that
the
drug
store
did
not
meet
the
space
requirements
was
also
invalid
for
the
first
summaries.
and
i
take
it
the
pharmacy
board
had
two
reasons
for
turning
down
snyder.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then,
when
that
was
appealed
by
you
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota,
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota
affirmed
on
the
constitutional
issue
but
reversed
the
district
court.
didn’t
it
on
the
space
issue
saying
that
the
board
should
have
further
proceedings?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
this
is
a
final
judgment
then
for
purposes
of
our
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
suppose
the
pharmacy
board
could
fine
against
snyder’s
on
that
issue
and
they
could
lose
--
they
could
be
denied
the
license
and
there’d
be
no
more
case,
would
there?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
very
likely
not
on
a
constitutional
basis?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
ordinarily,
the
way
that
the
rational
basis
test
is
applied
isn’t
by
testimony
and
hearings
in
the
lower
court
or
it’s
that
if
any
state
or
facts
can
be
conceived
by
the
court.
you
don’t
generally
rely
on
live
witnesses
in
that
sort
of
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
in
this
particular
case,
i
take
it
that
if
the
thing
went
back
to
the
pharmacy
board
and
the
pharmacy
board
decides
that
the
space
requirements
are
met,
you
could
still
appeal
that
through
the
north
dakota
supreme
this
system,
you
may
lose
on
that
issue,
you’ll
certainly
lose
on
the
constitutional
issue
because
there’s
no
indication
that
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota
will
change
its
mind.
but
then,
you
will
have
a
genuinely
final
judgment
where
the
issuance
vel
non
of
the
license
turns
on
the
constitutional
question
and
nothing
else.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
in
response
to
the
supreme
court’s
order?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
vlandis
against
kline,
do
you
think
that
lands
any
support?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
court’s
decision
last
term
in
vlandis
against
kline,
the
residency
requirement
for
out
of
state
tuition
lands
some
support
to
your
position?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
vogel,
your
statement
a
moment
ago
about
mr.
lucas
being
under
an
obligation
to
supply
affidavits
under
north
dakota
summary
judgment
procedure.
that
would
be
limited
to
the
situation
where
there
was
a
disputed
issue
of
fact.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
i
--
i
suppose
that
the
ordinary
way,
under
the
rational
basis
test
that
you
justify
a
statute
isn’t
by
a
parade
of
witnesses
but
by
arguments
as
to
conceivable
states
of
facts
that
are
really
considered
by
courts
pretty
much
in
the
abstract,
aren’t
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lucas,
