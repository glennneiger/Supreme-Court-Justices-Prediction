chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
72-1176,
north
dakota
board
of
pharmacy
against
snyder.
mr.
lucas,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
a
minute
to
these
propositions
that
mr.
justice
blackmun
was
inquiring
about.
even
if
it
isn’t
demonstrable
or
provable
that
these
premises
on
which
the
legislation
was
enacted
are
actually
true,
isn’t
the
constitutional
question
whether
a
state
legislator
has
the
right
to
think
that
they
have
an
impact
on
public
health?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
snyder’s
drug
prevails
here,
in
other
words
if
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota
decision
remain
standing.
under
your
north
dakota
statute,
could
the
red
owl
supermarket
have
one
side
of
the
market
for
groceries
and
all
the
other
things
they
sell
and
the
other
side
of
the
same
room
for
the
drug
store?
or
are
there
prohibitions
against
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
that
wouldn’t
forever
bar
you
from
getting
here
on
the
constitutional
question.
what
if
the
next
time
around
with
another
drug
operation,
they
found
them
qualified
and
then
rested
on
this
prior
holding?
you
could
come
up
–
presumably,
you
could
try
to
come
up
here
again,
couldn't
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
your
point
on
that
square
must
be
that
a
if
a
pharmacist
was
a
subordinate
to
a
manager
of
the
establishment
and
someone
tried
to
get
a
prescription
illegally
or
use
an
expired
prescription,
and
he
was
put
under
the
pressure
that
you
speak
of.
number
one,
if
he
committed
the
illegal
act,
he
wouldn’t
be
likely
to
report
it
to
anybody,
i
assume
that’s
reasonable.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
again,
does
it
not
come
back
to
whether
it
is
rational
for
the
north
dakota
legislature
to
believe
that
it’s
more
likely,
not
whether
you
can
prove
that
it’s
more
likely?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well,
mr.
lucas.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
vogel.mr.
mart
r.
vogel
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
would
acknowledge
that
you
can’t
control
a
jurisdiction
by
stipulation.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
any
question
about
the
rights
if
that
--
of
course,
were
followed
the
rights
of
the
states
to
try
to
get
back
here
again
after
they
resolved
the
factual
issues
in
your
state
court?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
don’t
have
to
justify
being
here
because
you
didn’t
here
on
your
own,
didn't
you
want
it?
[laughter]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
all
of
these
factors
and
not
always
disclosed
in
the
petitions
on
that
position.
did
you
--
i
don’t
recall,
but
did
you
challenge
that
in
any
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
as
justice
brennan
said,
you’d
rather
consider
jurisdiction
which
would
perhaps
allow
the
further
examination
into
that
subject.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
as
they
do
--
to
pass
it
to
the
practice
of
medicine
for
example.
practice
the
law.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
which
category
do
you
put
the
operation
of
a
pharmacy
by
a
corporation?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
the
property
you're
talking
about.
interferes
with
the
property
law?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
you
can’t
practice
medicine
in
north
dakota.
i
assume,
without
meeting
north
dakota’s
standards,
isn’t
that
right?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
that’s
really
what
it
comes
down
to
is
the
legislature
had
said
that
the
--
in
effect
that
the
operation
of
a
pharmacy
establishment
is
something
for
pharmacists
primarily.
that’s
the
real
contention
here,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
what
would
you
say
about
the
language
i
think
in
mcgowan
against
maryland
and
perhaps
some
other
cases
that
if
any
conceivable
basis
can
be
imagined
by
this
court,
then
we
must
support
and
sustain
the
state
action.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
say
it’s
not
conceivable
on
any
of
these
fears.
it
could
be
warranted
by
the
legislature?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
wouldn’t
it
almost
follow
that
if
they
didn’t
want
doctors
doing
it,
they
would
much
less
want
businessmen
doing
it?
if
you
reach
out
a
little
bit?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
does
this
record
not
show
that
snyder
drug
in
turn
is
owned
by
red
owl?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you,
mr.
vogel.
mr.
lucas,
so
your
time
has
expired
but
we
took
a
considerable
amount
at
the
end.
do
you
have
anything
urgent
that
you
wish
to
say
for
a
minute
or
two?
chief
justice
warren
e.

thank
you
gentlemen.
