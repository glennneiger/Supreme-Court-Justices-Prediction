justice
william
o.
douglas
this
case
is
here
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
north
dakota.
north
dakota
passed
a
statute
which
required
a
pharmacist,
if
a
corporation,
to
have
a
majority
of
its
stock
owned
by
registered
pharmacist
in
good
standing.
respondent,
snyder’s
drug
stores
incorporation,
applied
for
a
permit
to
run
a
pharmacy
in
the
state
and
was
denied
the
permit
on
the
basis
of
that
statute.
on
appeal
by
snyder
to
the
supreme
court,
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
held
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
on
the
basis
of
our
decision,
the
court’s
decision,
in
1928
in
the
liggett
case
from
pennsylvania
involving
a
like
statute.
there
are
two
points
in
the
opinion
dealt
with
it
in
some
length.
first
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
judgment
is
final
for
our
purposes
within
the
meaning
of
section
28,
u.s.
code
1257.
we
hold
for
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
that
it
is
final.
and
coming
to
the
merits,
we
conclude
that
the
liggett
case,
decided
in
1928,
is
out
of
line
and
consistent
with
the
decisions
handed
down
since
that
time
that
the
statute
of
north
dakota
is
constitutional
and
that
the
liggett
case
is,
therefore,
overruled.
as
a
result
we
have
reverse
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceeding.
