mr.
a.
william
lucas
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
am
william
lucas
representing
the
petitioner
in
this
action.
in
north
dakota,
we
have
a
statute
which
provides
that
if
a
corporation
applies
for
a
pharmacy
permit
that
a
majority
to
stock
in
that
corporation
must
be
owned
by
a
registered
pharmacist
in
good
standing,
actively
and
regularly
employed
in
and
responsible
for
that
actual
management,
operation
and
supervision
of
that
pharmacy.
now,
the
respondent
in
this
action
applied
for
a
pharmacy
permit.
and
in
their
application,
they
disclosed
that
all
of
the
stock
in
their
corporation
was
owned
by
red
owl
stores,
which
is
a
large
supermarket
chain
in
the
midwest
and
that
it
was
not
known
if
any
of
the
shareholders
of
red
owl
were
registered
pharmacists.
the
state
board
of
pharmacy
in
north
dakota
then
denied
this
application
based
upon
the
reason
that
they
did
not
comply
with
the
ownership
law
that
i
have
mentioned.
the
respondent
then
appealed
to
the
district
court
to
raise
various
constitutional
questions
mainly
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
equal
protection
clause
and
various
constitutional
issues
on
the
north
dakota
constitution
and
then
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
district
court
relied
on
the
liggett
versus
baldridge’s
decision
of
this
case
and
declared
that
this
statute
was
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
and
also
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
unconstitutional.
the
petitioner
then
appealed
to
the
north
dakota
supreme
court,
and
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
basically
relied
entirely
on
the
liggett
versus
baldridge’s
decision
of
this
court
in
1928
and
stated
being
bound
by
the
decision
in
liggett
versus
baldridge
and
see
an
insufficient
reason
to
distinguish
that
decision
from
this
case,
we
sustain
a
trial
court’s
conclusion.
the
liggett
decision
was
based
upon
a
pennsylvania
statute
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
that’s
correct.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
there
is
the
ownership
compliance
problem
and
then
the
physical
safeguard
problem.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
that’s
correct
your
honor.
they
decided
there
was
a
fact
question
in
regard
to
the
physical
safeguards.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
it
was
final
in
regard
to
the
constitutional
question.
it
was
remanded
back
down
for
an
additional
hearing
in
regard
to
the
physical
safeguard
problem
of
the
facility.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
it
would
be
appealed.
i
imagined
by
the
respondent
again
if
it
adverse
on
physical
safeguard
feature.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
no.
i
think
that
the
decision
was
final
in
regard
to
the
constitutional
questions
presented.
on
the
liggett
decision,
that
involved
the
pennsylvania
statute
which
required
100%
ownership
by
a
pharmacist
and
both,
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
on
the
liggett
decision
were
based
entirely
on
a
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
feel
that
the
basic
issue
here
is
whether
the
liggett
versus
baldridge
decision
is
proper
authority
for
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
to
rely
on
or
if
it
has
been
reversed
or
if
it
should
be
reversed.
now,
there
has
been
a
large
change
in
the
philosophy
of
the
supreme
court
in
regard
to
what
legal
writers
have
referred
to
as
economic
due
process
since
the
liggett
versus
baldridge
decision.
in
our
briefs,
we
traced
this
history
citing
the
lochner,
adkins
and
coppage
on
the
later
cases
which
have
rejected
those
cases.
in
examining
the
later
cases
such
as
griswold
versus
connecticut,
ferguson
versus
skrupa,
williamson
versus
lee
optical,
daniel
versus
family
security,
savion
versus
hostetler.
it’s
very
clear
in
my
examination
at
least
that
the
doctrine
that
prevailed
in
coppage,
adkins
and
lochner
cases
has
been
abandoned
by
this
court.
this
court
has
stated
we
emphatically
refused
to
go
back
to
the
time
when
we
used
the
due
process
clause
to
strike
down
state
laws,
regulatory
or
business
in
economic
affairs
because
we
feel
they
are
unwise
and
prudent
or
out
of
harmony
with
some
particular
school
of
thought.
the
court
has
stated
we
do
not
set
as
a
superlegislature
to
judge
the
wisdom
need
reasonable
on
us
or
merits
of
state
laws
that
touch
economic
problems
or
business
affairs
or
social
conditions
that
under
our
system
of
government,
these
issues
are
properly
left
to
the
legislative
branch
of
government.
now,
in
the
daniel
versus
family
security
life
case,
specific
reference
was
made
to
the
liggett
case
and
has
said
that
the
rational
followed
in
that
case
did
not
find
expression
in
the
liggett
versus
baldridge
decision
and
that
there
has
been
a
pronounced
shift
of
emphasis
since
the
liggett
versus
baldridge
decision.
also,
i
have
stated
various
state
court
decisions
that
have
said
that
collins
and
liggett
have
been
seriously
limited
if
not
completely
undermined.
now
based
on
these
decisions,
we
feel
there
is
an
extreme
presumption
of
constitutionality
and
validity
of
state
legislation
in
this
particular
area
that
if
the
north
dakota
legislature
determined
that
there
was
an
evil
present
and
this
was
a
rational
way
to
prevent
this
evil
or
to
correct
the
exposure
to
this
evil
that
this
is
efficient
to
sustain
the
constitutionality
and
validity
of
the
statute
that
if
any
set
of
facts
can
reasonably
justify
the
statute,
we
feel
that
is
efficient.
now,
the
respondent,
in
their
brief
that
raised
also
the
equal
protection
clause
and
amicus
brief
for
the
national
association
of
chain
drug
stores
devoted
more
time
to
this.
i
think
this
basically
is
governed
by
the
same
standard
of
review
as
the
due
process
clause
that
only
invidious
discrimination
is
prohibited
and
the
states
have
wide
latitude
in
this
regard.
i
think
it’s
got
the
same
standard
as
the
due
process
clause
and
in
effect,
it
should
be
also
left
after
the
states
in
their
own
wisdom
and
judgment
as
far
as
the
a
passage
of
such
legislation.
now,
the
amicus
of
national
association
of
chain
drug
stores
also
raised
the
commerce
clause
issue
and
this
was
raised
for
the
first
time
on
appeal
and
i
don’t
think
it’s
properly
raised
or
should
be
under
consideration
here
when
it
is
raised
for
the
first
time
on
appeal.
however,
the
case
as
i
cite
had
to
do
mainly
with
the
state’s
attempt
to
protect
local
industry
at
the
exclusion
of
national
industry
or
some
outside
national
commerce
depot
and
that
the
case
as
they
say
such
as
dean
versus
city
of
madison
where
case
is
where
the
state
attempted
to
protect
the
local
industry
such
as
requiring
that
milk
process
within
five
miles.
it
had
to
be
a
process
within
five
miles
in
the
city
of
madison.
and
this
particular
statute
applies
at
what
we
have
in
this
case
equally
to
local
corporations,
local
chain
stores
--
we
have
local
chain
stores
or
chain
stores
within
the
state
of
north
dakota
and
this
law
applies
equally
to
those
as
well
as
any
national
chain
stores
that
they
might
refer
to.
also,
we
do
not
feel
that
this
statute
has
anything
to
do
with
interstate
commerce.
i
think
it’s
safe
to
say
that
there
are
no
prescription
drugs
manufactured
in
the
state
of
north
dakota.
and
i
think,
i
can
also
say
that
all
prescription
drugs
that
are
properly
approved
by
the
federal
government
are
available
in
north
dakota.
and
that
the
volume
in
sale
of
prescription
drugs
of
course
is
governed
by
prescriptions
from
doctors.
and
if
for
example,
we
led
a
hundred
more
chain
stores
or
a
hundred
more
stores
opened
in
the
state,
theoretically,
there
will
be
no
greater
sale
of
prescription
drugs
because
they
are
limited
to
prescriptions
and
i
think
they
would
have
to
point
out
that
there
are
--
it’s
the
demand
for
prescription
drugs
which
are
not
being
filled
in
the
state
and
there
is
no
evidence
of
course
in
that
regard.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
we
feel
it
is
related
to
the
public
health
and
welfare.
do
you
want
me
to
cover
that
point,
i
would
do
it
at
this
time.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
the
primary
purpose
at
the
time,
i
think
one
of
the
main
purposes
was
to
prohibit
physician
ownership
of
drugstores.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
in
california,
there
is
a
medical
clinic
case
and
they
had
hearings
in
there
and
the
decision
is
documented
and
there
is
an
inherent
conflict
to
interest
in
positions
only
in
a
pharmacy.
i
can
imagine
a
more
--
what
a
tragic
situation.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
it’s
related
to
the
public
health
physician
of
course.
he
can
call
the
prescriptions.
they
don’t
have
to
go
through
his
store.
he
can
charge
higher
prices.
he
can
carry
a
lower
inventory
of
items
and
he
can
limit
his
prescriptions
to
certain
items
which
make
it
more
profitable
for
him.
the
public
may
end
up
using
more
drugs.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
mainly
because
their
--
a
physician
can
make
or
dispense
his
own
prescriptions
i
suppose
in
a
hospital
that
feel
it
will
be
supervised
properly
by
physicians
in
the
hospitals.
they
want…
mr.
a.
william
lucas
but
in
the
hospital,
it
won’t
be
owned
by
the
physician.
it
will
be
owned
by
the
hospital.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
that
is
correct.
i
don’t
know
that
there
are
any
in
north
dakota
but
apparently,
the
physician
is
that
they
will
be
probably
supervised
and
will
not
result
in
a
danger
to
the
public
account.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
if
a
pharmacist
sells
his
stock
down
to
49%?
mr.
a.
william
lucas
yes.
you
would
not
be
in
compliance
then
with
the
statute.
that
is
correct.
he
could
not
do
that.
and
still
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
that
has
never
happened
to
my
knowledge.
i
suppose
it
would
have
to
be
a
determination
of
board
at
that
time
but
that
is
the
way
the
statute
reads.
i
might
add
up
that
pennsylvania
and
maryland
also
have
the
anti-physician
prohibition
of
ownership
with
pharmacies.
and
also,
in
the
united
states
senate,
there
is
a
hart
(ph)
bill
in
the
various
hearings
in
the
senate
and
i
think
that
it
was
determined
that
the
abusers
were
shown
in
that
record
as
well
as
the
california
case.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
i
think
it
is.
also,
we
feel
that
non-pharmacist
ownership
was
resolved
in
a
subordination
of
professional
responsibility
and
professional
service
to
commercial
motives.
now,
we
feel
they
might
emphasize
profit
and
there’s
lot
of
ways
that
they
can
emphasize
profit
and
the
investors
and
non-pharmacist
on
stores
of
course
are
looking
for
a
return
on
their
investment.
and
they
can
do
such
thing
as
using
drugs
for
legislators
to
bring
traffic
into
sell
their
other
products,
branch
builders
and
grass
seeds
and
this
other
thing.
they
can
keep
their
inventory
down
and
only
carry
fast
moving
items
so
you
can
understaff
a
pharmacy
so
that
the
pharmacist
has
to
work
long
hours
with
very
little
or
brief
rest
or
time
off
their
lunch
which
results
in
mental
fatigue
and
the
possibility
of
an
error
in
filling
a
prescription.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
we’ll
we
feel
that
a
pharmacist
--
a
professional
would
have
to
be
more
sensitive
to
these
problems.
and
what
i
realized
that
public
service
and
public
responsibility
more
of
a
police
within
a
profession,
similar
to
perhaps
the
law
provision
that
we
have
laws
that
may
protect
these
problems
in
some
areas
but
it’s
an
enforcement
problem.
and
in
north
dakota,
we
have
only
one
inspector
of
these,
perhaps
in
the
state
board
and
he’s
got
all
these
other
duties
and
he
simply
can’t
enforce
these
problems
and
we
feel
that
this
in
some
way
would
resolve
any
internal
policy
in
other
profession
if
the
pharmacists
have
control.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
no.
they
have
no
objection
in
that
regard.
in
their
brief,
they
admitted
that
prohibition
and
physician
ownership
is
a
valid
purpose.
they
recognized
that
in
their
briefs.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
i
think
that’s
the
plan
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
if
the
believe
and
that
they
bought
it
in,
they
did
believe
it
to
be
a
rational
basis
that
statute
for
protection.
i
think
if
this
is
true,
that
is
all
that
is
required
that
the
court’s
are
not
going
to
try
to
second
guess
the
legislature
and
why
they
did
this.
that
is
a
presumption
that
it’s
a
valid
purpose
and
a
valid
statute.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
north
dakota
is
the
only
one
with
majority
requirement.
michigan
has
a
25%
requirement.
it’s
gone
to
the
supreme
court
three
times
and
it
has
not
to
date
by
majority
decision
been
declared
unconstitutional.
it’s
a
very
unusual
situation
there
and
two
or
three
of
the
justices
wrote
that
they
thought
it
was
unconstitutional.
one
wrote
that
was
his
opinion
as
first
and
it’s
--
every
judge
wrote
his
own
opinion.
the
justice
wrote
his
own
opinion
and
there’s
no
majority
decision
in
that
court.
and
new
york,
i
understand
passed
this
legislation
of
a
recent
session
and
it
was
vetoed
by
the
governor
based
upon
the
liggett
versus
baldridge
decision
and
alaska
i
believe
has
this
recently
which
was
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
they
do.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
just
a
provision
--
a
statute
similar
to
ours
was
passed
recently
and
was
vetoed.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
they
are
not
in
the
record
because
this
was
decided
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
we
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
present
evidence
in
this
regard.
in
michigan,
they
had
various
hearings
and
this
is
a
well-documented
testimony
from
pharmacologists
and
practicing
pharmacists
in
michigan
and
various
other
individuals.
we
may
have
wanted
that
opportunity
but
we
did
not
have
it.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
yes.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
i’m
certain
that
we
can
present
the
evidence.
i’m
sure
there’ll
be
contrary
evidence
too,
but
certainly
it
will
be
very
debatable
questions.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
1963.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
i
think
it
all
as
in
the
respondent’s
brief.
they
have
a
short
synopsis
of
the
reasons
given
at
that
time
but
it’s
just
in
one
branch.
either
the
senate
or
congress
it
doesn’t
cover
both
hearings.
but
i
believe
that
hearings
were
held
in
both
houses
and
this
was
their
judgment
after
the
hearings.
i
think
one
of
them.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
no,
they’re
not.
just
shortened
notes
or
notes
by
whoever
is
employed
at
that
time.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
until
1963
as
when
it
was
passed.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
not
in
north
dakota.
the
pennsylvania
and
new
york
statute
were
1920
and
1929.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
we’ve
asked
for
that
before
and
that
would
be
fine.
basically,
they
just
like
to
have
liggett
versus
baldridge
if
it
is
to
be
reversed
--clearly
reversed
at
this
time
and
north
dakota’s
supreme
court
relied
to
completely
on
liggett
versus
baldridge
so
that
would
result
in
the
reversal
of
north
dakota’s
supreme
court
we
believe.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
that’s
true
that’s
why
i’m
throwing
out
these
arguments
as
relating
it
to
the
public
account.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
if
it
was
reversed
--
it
was
in
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
and
that’s
why
we
feel
fear.
and
if
this
court
would
reverse
that
decision,
that
would
close
at
one
point.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
the
question
on
the
physical
facility
is
still
open
whether
they
have
proper
receiving
areas
so
we
don’t
have
carry
and
the
drugs
coming
down
the
same
conveyor
belt,
things
of
this
type.
and
a
security
measure
is
around
the
facility
is
open.
but
the
constitutional
question
is
closed
against
the
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
[laughter]
well,
that’s
what’s
happened.
they
got
into
all
these
other
areas.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
it
could.
we
require
a
certain
physical
safeguard
such
as
a
chain
door
or
a
barrier
of
some
kind
which
can
secure
the
area
from
the
rest
of
the
areas
so
when
they
stock
--
when
they
are
stocking
in
shelves.
they’re
not
walking
in
and
out
of
the
pharmacy
too.
but
they
could
chain
off
an
area
of
some
type
as
long
as
they
are
secured.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
that
they
would
have
declared
our
statute
in
constitution,
you
mean?
mr.
a.
william
lucas
no,
i
don’t
believe
we
could
have
come
here.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well
basically,
i
think
it’s
because
they
relied
entirely
on
liggett
versus
baldridge
and
so
as
my
position
on
this
court,
we
think
it
reverse
that
issue.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
because
of
physical
safeguards?
mr.
a.
william
lucas
but
it
would
still
mean
that
our
statute
was
constitutional,
the
ownership
statute.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
we
think
that
raise
us
a
constitutional
question
which
would
allow
us
to
come
here.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
i
think
it’s
basically
just
whether
this
is
a
proper
decision
of
the
court
of
the
--
in
liggett
versus
baldridge
since
they
relied
entirely
on
liggett
versus
baldridge.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
our
statute
is
declared
about
each
of
the
due
process
clause
the
u.s.
constitution
had
--
i
think
it’s
jurisdiction
to
be
here.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
if
our
statute
was
still
determined
to
be
constitutional,
it’s
still
an
event.
i
could
speak
and
use
it
again,
but
i
don’t
think
that
that
would
be
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
which
we
can’t
do
at
this
point.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
that’s
correct.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
no,
we
don’t.
we
think
there’s
still
a
physical
safeguard
problem
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
as
serious
as
the
constitutional
problem.
we
feel
that
professional
pharmacies
are
going
to
offer
certain
services
that
non-professional
pharmacies
may
not.
a
lot
of
these
services
don’t
resolve
in
any
volume
or
profit
or
anything
to
the
pharmacy.
drug
consultation
is
one
item
which
we
feel
that
professionals
will
give
by
counseling
patients
on
interaction
of
drugs
or
incompatibilities
or
abuse
of
this
type.
a
new
area
is
not
too
very
new
but
in
new
jersey,
they
require
a
medication
profile
monitor
and
a
pharmacy
then
keeps
track
of
all
drugs
prescribed
and
dispensed
to
a
particular
patient.
and
if
he
sees
two
or
three
or
four
different
doctors,
the
pharmacy
has
a
record
of
all
items
dispensed
that
that
patient
is
receiving.
we
can
monitor
these
prescriptions
and
then
tell
if
there
are
any
incompatibilities
or
abuse
or
other
date
prescriptions
things
of
this
type.
it
also
offers
delivery,
emergency
hours
and
that
open
charged
accounts
which
a
lot
of
these
larger
chain
store
drugs
don’t.
and
we
feel
that
these
are
professional
services
that
are
related
to
public
health
and
welfare
and
should
be
offered.
now,
we
feel
that
pharmacy
is
a
profession
that’s
been
decided
by
case
law
and
statute
and
we
don’t
feel
that
it
should
be
treated
any
differently
than
a
professional
law,
medicine,
optometry
or
dentistry
that
we
had
two
cases
in
the
u.s.
supreme
court
on
optometry
and
dentistry
which
state
that
a
corporation
cannot
practice
through
licensed
individuals.
those
particular
professions
do
we
feel
that
the
profession
of
pharmacy
should
be
treated
the
same
way.
we
submit
that
the
philosophy
of
liggett
has
been
abandoned
and
we
ask
that
it’d
be
clearly
reversed
to
this
time
and
that
therefore
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
should
also
be
reversed.
subject
to
question
cited
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
we
don't
think
so.
we
want
the
people
in
the
position
on
making
a
policy
to
be
professionals.
a
pharmacist
has
to
yield
to
a
non-professional
if
that
non-professional
owns
the
place.
he
either
says,
you
do
this
or
you
lose
your
job.
and
we
don’t
want
a
professional
yielding
in
being
in
that
position
and
we
want
the
policy
makers
to
be
professionals
so
that
they
will
offer
all
these
services
that
we
think
are
necessary.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
he
is
but
when
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
it
is
your
honor.
but
if
non-owner
says
you
do
this
or
you
lose
your
job,
what
are
you
going
to
do?
mr.
a.
william
lucas
right.
but
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
we
feel
that
the
professionals
to
be
more
sensitive
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
right.
we
feel
that
the
professional
pharmacist
to
be
more
sensitive
in
this
area
of
professional
responsibility
and
professional
service.
and
he
will
not
subordinate
these
objectives
to
commercial
motives.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
they’re
doing
it,
yes
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
we
feel
that
it
is,
your
honor.
also,
i
placed
on
the
responsibility
a
non-pharmacist
is
not
competent
to
really
determine
the
competency
of
a
particular
pharmacist.
and
if
he
is
incompetent
and
there
is
a
misconduct,
he
will
say,
“well,
how
could
i
know?
i’m
not
a
pharmacist.”
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
majority
ownership
means
control.
that
gives
you
the
majority
and
the
board
of
directors
which
determine
policy
and
they
want
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
but
we
think
that
if
they
are
pharmacists,
they
are
going
to
know.
if
they’re
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
i’m
not
sure,
your
honor.
i
mention
to
do
that.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
they
would
be
limited
to
--
well,
one
pharmacist
could
own
more
than
one
pharmacy
under
this
law
if
he
has
majority
of
control
of
each
pharmacy.
we
have
a
local
chain
which
probably
has
six
locations
in
six
major
cities
and
it
could
be
owned
by
one
individual
if
he
had
majority
ownership.
now,
we
want
a
policy
that
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
it
could
be.
but
at
least
this
one
would
ensure
that
you
would
have
some
understanding
of
the
profession
and
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
no.
but
it
would
be
more
likely
that
he
would
watch
it
and
understand
the
professional
objectives.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
that’s
our
point
that
if
any
state
can
be
conceived
that
that
is
just
a
bias.
if
he
voted
it,
they
must
have
thought
that
they
were
against.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
thank
you.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don’t
have
anything
real
urgent.
i’d
like
to
say
that
in
my
return
to
the
motion,
i
admitted
that
there
was
no
question
or
fact
in
regard
to
the
basic
ownership
as
to
who
on
the
stock.
i
think
there’s
an
obvious
question
of
fact
whether
the
statute
is
related
to
the
public
health
and
safety.
and
one
point
as
far
as
relating
it,
i
didn’t
mention.
in
north
dakota
of
course,
we
need
small
town
pharmacies.
and
when
you
get
to
interstate
highways
in
ease
of
chance
--
getting
to
the
bigger
cities,
when
these
chain
stores
advertise
by
of
course
a
motor
oil
for
a
dollar
and
they
all
run
this
mart
to
get
their
motor
oil
and
pick
up
their
prescriptions,
this
hurts
the
small
town
pharmacies.
and
as
a
public
health
requirement
and
necessity,
i
think
that
the
small
towns
have
their
pharmacies,
and
this
is
another
basis
that
could
be
used
to
justify
it.
thank
you.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
am
william
lucas
representing
the
petitioner
in
this
action.
in
north
dakota,
we
have
a
statute
which
provides
that
if
a
corporation
applies
for
a
pharmacy
permit
that
a
majority
to
stock
in
that
corporation
must
be
owned
by
a
registered
pharmacist
in
good
standing,
actively
and
regularly
employed
in
and
responsible
for
that
actual
management,
operation
and
supervision
of
that
pharmacy.
now,
the
respondent
in
this
action
applied
for
a
pharmacy
permit.
and
in
their
application,
they
disclosed
that
all
of
the
stock
in
their
corporation
was
owned
by
red
owl
stores,
which
is
a
large
supermarket
chain
in
the
midwest
and
that
it
was
not
known
if
any
of
the
shareholders
of
red
owl
were
registered
pharmacists.
the
state
board
of
pharmacy
in
north
dakota
then
denied
this
application
based
upon
the
reason
that
they
did
not
comply
with
the
ownership
law
that
i
have
mentioned.
the
respondent
then
appealed
to
the
district
court
to
raise
various
constitutional
questions
mainly
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
equal
protection
clause
and
various
constitutional
issues
on
the
north
dakota
constitution
and
then
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
the
district
court
relied
on
the
liggett
versus
baldridge’s
decision
of
this
case
and
declared
that
this
statute
was
a
violation
of
the
due
process
clause
and
also
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
unconstitutional.
the
petitioner
then
appealed
to
the
north
dakota
supreme
court,
and
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
basically
relied
entirely
on
the
liggett
versus
baldridge’s
decision
of
this
court
in
1928
and
stated
being
bound
by
the
decision
in
liggett
versus
baldridge
and
see
an
insufficient
reason
to
distinguish
that
decision
from
this
case,
we
sustain
a
trial
court’s
conclusion.
the
liggett
decision
was
based
upon
a
pennsylvania
statute
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
that’s
correct.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
there
is
the
ownership
compliance
problem
and
then
the
physical
safeguard
problem.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
that’s
correct
your
honor.
they
decided
there
was
a
fact
question
in
regard
to
the
physical
safeguards.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
it
was
final
in
regard
to
the
constitutional
question.
it
was
remanded
back
down
for
an
additional
hearing
in
regard
to
the
physical
safeguard
problem
of
the
facility.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
it
would
be
appealed.
i
imagined
by
the
respondent
again
if
it
adverse
on
physical
safeguard
feature.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
no.
i
think
that
the
decision
was
final
in
regard
to
the
constitutional
questions
presented.
on
the
liggett
decision,
that
involved
the
pennsylvania
statute
which
required
100%
ownership
by
a
pharmacist
and
both,
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
on
the
liggett
decision
were
based
entirely
on
a
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
feel
that
the
basic
issue
here
is
whether
the
liggett
versus
baldridge
decision
is
proper
authority
for
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
to
rely
on
or
if
it
has
been
reversed
or
if
it
should
be
reversed.
now,
there
has
been
a
large
change
in
the
philosophy
of
the
supreme
court
in
regard
to
what
legal
writers
have
referred
to
as
economic
due
process
since
the
liggett
versus
baldridge
decision.
in
our
briefs,
we
traced
this
history
citing
the
lochner,
adkins
and
coppage
on
the
later
cases
which
have
rejected
those
cases.
in
examining
the
later
cases
such
as
griswold
versus
connecticut,
ferguson
versus
skrupa,
williamson
versus
lee
optical,
daniel
versus
family
security,
savion
versus
hostetler.
it’s
very
clear
in
my
examination
at
least
that
the
doctrine
that
prevailed
in
coppage,
adkins
and
lochner
cases
has
been
abandoned
by
this
court.
this
court
has
stated
we
emphatically
refused
to
go
back
to
the
time
when
we
used
the
due
process
clause
to
strike
down
state
laws,
regulatory
or
business
in
economic
affairs
because
we
feel
they
are
unwise
and
prudent
or
out
of
harmony
with
some
particular
school
of
thought.
the
court
has
stated
we
do
not
set
as
a
superlegislature
to
judge
the
wisdom
need
reasonable
on
us
or
merits
of
state
laws
that
touch
economic
problems
or
business
affairs
or
social
conditions
that
under
our
system
of
government,
these
issues
are
properly
left
to
the
legislative
branch
of
government.
now,
in
the
daniel
versus
family
security
life
case,
specific
reference
was
made
to
the
liggett
case
and
has
said
that
the
rational
followed
in
that
case
did
not
find
expression
in
the
liggett
versus
baldridge
decision
and
that
there
has
been
a
pronounced
shift
of
emphasis
since
the
liggett
versus
baldridge
decision.
also,
i
have
stated
various
state
court
decisions
that
have
said
that
collins
and
liggett
have
been
seriously
limited
if
not
completely
undermined.
now
based
on
these
decisions,
we
feel
there
is
an
extreme
presumption
of
constitutionality
and
validity
of
state
legislation
in
this
particular
area
that
if
the
north
dakota
legislature
determined
that
there
was
an
evil
present
and
this
was
a
rational
way
to
prevent
this
evil
or
to
correct
the
exposure
to
this
evil
that
this
is
efficient
to
sustain
the
constitutionality
and
validity
of
the
statute
that
if
any
set
of
facts
can
reasonably
justify
the
statute,
we
feel
that
is
efficient.
now,
the
respondent,
in
their
brief
that
raised
also
the
equal
protection
clause
and
amicus
brief
for
the
national
association
of
chain
drug
stores
devoted
more
time
to
this.
i
think
this
basically
is
governed
by
the
same
standard
of
review
as
the
due
process
clause
that
only
invidious
discrimination
is
prohibited
and
the
states
have
wide
latitude
in
this
regard.
i
think
it’s
got
the
same
standard
as
the
due
process
clause
and
in
effect,
it
should
be
also
left
after
the
states
in
their
own
wisdom
and
judgment
as
far
as
the
a
passage
of
such
legislation.
now,
the
amicus
of
national
association
of
chain
drug
stores
also
raised
the
commerce
clause
issue
and
this
was
raised
for
the
first
time
on
appeal
and
i
don’t
think
it’s
properly
raised
or
should
be
under
consideration
here
when
it
is
raised
for
the
first
time
on
appeal.
however,
the
case
as
i
cite
had
to
do
mainly
with
the
state’s
attempt
to
protect
local
industry
at
the
exclusion
of
national
industry
or
some
outside
national
commerce
depot
and
that
the
case
as
they
say
such
as
dean
versus
city
of
madison
where
case
is
where
the
state
attempted
to
protect
the
local
industry
such
as
requiring
that
milk
process
within
five
miles.
it
had
to
be
a
process
within
five
miles
in
the
city
of
madison.
and
this
particular
statute
applies
at
what
we
have
in
this
case
equally
to
local
corporations,
local
chain
stores
--
we
have
local
chain
stores
or
chain
stores
within
the
state
of
north
dakota
and
this
law
applies
equally
to
those
as
well
as
any
national
chain
stores
that
they
might
refer
to.
also,
we
do
not
feel
that
this
statute
has
anything
to
do
with
interstate
commerce.
i
think
it’s
safe
to
say
that
there
are
no
prescription
drugs
manufactured
in
the
state
of
north
dakota.
and
i
think,
i
can
also
say
that
all
prescription
drugs
that
are
properly
approved
by
the
federal
government
are
available
in
north
dakota.
and
that
the
volume
in
sale
of
prescription
drugs
of
course
is
governed
by
prescriptions
from
doctors.
and
if
for
example,
we
led
a
hundred
more
chain
stores
or
a
hundred
more
stores
opened
in
the
state,
theoretically,
there
will
be
no
greater
sale
of
prescription
drugs
because
they
are
limited
to
prescriptions
and
i
think
they
would
have
to
point
out
that
there
are
--
it’s
the
demand
for
prescription
drugs
which
are
not
being
filled
in
the
state
and
there
is
no
evidence
of
course
in
that
regard.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
we
feel
it
is
related
to
the
public
health
and
welfare.
do
you
want
me
to
cover
that
point,
i
would
do
it
at
this
time.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
the
primary
purpose
at
the
time,
i
think
one
of
the
main
purposes
was
to
prohibit
physician
ownership
of
drugstores.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
in
california,
there
is
a
medical
clinic
case
and
they
had
hearings
in
there
and
the
decision
is
documented
and
there
is
an
inherent
conflict
to
interest
in
positions
only
in
a
pharmacy.
i
can
imagine
a
more
--
what
a
tragic
situation.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
it’s
related
to
the
public
health
physician
of
course.
he
can
call
the
prescriptions.
they
don’t
have
to
go
through
his
store.
he
can
charge
higher
prices.
he
can
carry
a
lower
inventory
of
items
and
he
can
limit
his
prescriptions
to
certain
items
which
make
it
more
profitable
for
him.
the
public
may
end
up
using
more
drugs.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
mainly
because
their
--
a
physician
can
make
or
dispense
his
own
prescriptions
i
suppose
in
a
hospital
that
feel
it
will
be
supervised
properly
by
physicians
in
the
hospitals.
they
want…
mr.
a.
william
lucas
but
in
the
hospital,
it
won’t
be
owned
by
the
physician.
it
will
be
owned
by
the
hospital.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
that
is
correct.
i
don’t
know
that
there
are
any
in
north
dakota
but
apparently,
the
physician
is
that
they
will
be
probably
supervised
and
will
not
result
in
a
danger
to
the
public
account.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
if
a
pharmacist
sells
his
stock
down
to
49%?
mr.
a.
william
lucas
yes.
you
would
not
be
in
compliance
then
with
the
statute.
that
is
correct.
he
could
not
do
that.
and
still
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
that
has
never
happened
to
my
knowledge.
i
suppose
it
would
have
to
be
a
determination
of
board
at
that
time
but
that
is
the
way
the
statute
reads.
i
might
add
up
that
pennsylvania
and
maryland
also
have
the
anti-physician
prohibition
of
ownership
with
pharmacies.
and
also,
in
the
united
states
senate,
there
is
a
hart
(ph)
bill
in
the
various
hearings
in
the
senate
and
i
think
that
it
was
determined
that
the
abusers
were
shown
in
that
record
as
well
as
the
california
case.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
i
think
it
is.
also,
we
feel
that
non-pharmacist
ownership
was
resolved
in
a
subordination
of
professional
responsibility
and
professional
service
to
commercial
motives.
now,
we
feel
they
might
emphasize
profit
and
there’s
lot
of
ways
that
they
can
emphasize
profit
and
the
investors
and
non-pharmacist
on
stores
of
course
are
looking
for
a
return
on
their
investment.
and
they
can
do
such
thing
as
using
drugs
for
legislators
to
bring
traffic
into
sell
their
other
products,
branch
builders
and
grass
seeds
and
this
other
thing.
they
can
keep
their
inventory
down
and
only
carry
fast
moving
items
so
you
can
understaff
a
pharmacy
so
that
the
pharmacist
has
to
work
long
hours
with
very
little
or
brief
rest
or
time
off
their
lunch
which
results
in
mental
fatigue
and
the
possibility
of
an
error
in
filling
a
prescription.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
we’ll
we
feel
that
a
pharmacist
--
a
professional
would
have
to
be
more
sensitive
to
these
problems.
and
what
i
realized
that
public
service
and
public
responsibility
more
of
a
police
within
a
profession,
similar
to
perhaps
the
law
provision
that
we
have
laws
that
may
protect
these
problems
in
some
areas
but
it’s
an
enforcement
problem.
and
in
north
dakota,
we
have
only
one
inspector
of
these,
perhaps
in
the
state
board
and
he’s
got
all
these
other
duties
and
he
simply
can’t
enforce
these
problems
and
we
feel
that
this
in
some
way
would
resolve
any
internal
policy
in
other
profession
if
the
pharmacists
have
control.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
no.
they
have
no
objection
in
that
regard.
in
their
brief,
they
admitted
that
prohibition
and
physician
ownership
is
a
valid
purpose.
they
recognized
that
in
their
briefs.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
i
think
that’s
the
plan
i
am
trying
to
make
is
that
if
the
believe
and
that
they
bought
it
in,
they
did
believe
it
to
be
a
rational
basis
that
statute
for
protection.
i
think
if
this
is
true,
that
is
all
that
is
required
that
the
court’s
are
not
going
to
try
to
second
guess
the
legislature
and
why
they
did
this.
that
is
a
presumption
that
it’s
a
valid
purpose
and
a
valid
statute.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
north
dakota
is
the
only
one
with
majority
requirement.
michigan
has
a
25%
requirement.
it’s
gone
to
the
supreme
court
three
times
and
it
has
not
to
date
by
majority
decision
been
declared
unconstitutional.
it’s
a
very
unusual
situation
there
and
two
or
three
of
the
justices
wrote
that
they
thought
it
was
unconstitutional.
one
wrote
that
was
his
opinion
as
first
and
it’s
--
every
judge
wrote
his
own
opinion.
the
justice
wrote
his
own
opinion
and
there’s
no
majority
decision
in
that
court.
and
new
york,
i
understand
passed
this
legislation
of
a
recent
session
and
it
was
vetoed
by
the
governor
based
upon
the
liggett
versus
baldridge
decision
and
alaska
i
believe
has
this
recently
which
was
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
they
do.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
just
a
provision
--
a
statute
similar
to
ours
was
passed
recently
and
was
vetoed.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
they
are
not
in
the
record
because
this
was
decided
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
we
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
present
evidence
in
this
regard.
in
michigan,
they
had
various
hearings
and
this
is
a
well-documented
testimony
from
pharmacologists
and
practicing
pharmacists
in
michigan
and
various
other
individuals.
we
may
have
wanted
that
opportunity
but
we
did
not
have
it.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
yes.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
i’m
certain
that
we
can
present
the
evidence.
i’m
sure
there’ll
be
contrary
evidence
too,
but
certainly
it
will
be
very
debatable
questions.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
1963.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
i
think
it
all
as
in
the
respondent’s
brief.
they
have
a
short
synopsis
of
the
reasons
given
at
that
time
but
it’s
just
in
one
branch.
either
the
senate
or
congress
it
doesn’t
cover
both
hearings.
but
i
believe
that
hearings
were
held
in
both
houses
and
this
was
their
judgment
after
the
hearings.
i
think
one
of
them.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
no,
they’re
not.
just
shortened
notes
or
notes
by
whoever
is
employed
at
that
time.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
until
1963
as
when
it
was
passed.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
not
in
north
dakota.
the
pennsylvania
and
new
york
statute
were
1920
and
1929.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
we’ve
asked
for
that
before
and
that
would
be
fine.
basically,
they
just
like
to
have
liggett
versus
baldridge
if
it
is
to
be
reversed
--clearly
reversed
at
this
time
and
north
dakota’s
supreme
court
relied
to
completely
on
liggett
versus
baldridge
so
that
would
result
in
the
reversal
of
north
dakota’s
supreme
court
we
believe.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
that’s
true
that’s
why
i’m
throwing
out
these
arguments
as
relating
it
to
the
public
account.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
if
it
was
reversed
--
it
was
in
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
and
that’s
why
we
feel
fear.
and
if
this
court
would
reverse
that
decision,
that
would
close
at
one
point.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
the
question
on
the
physical
facility
is
still
open
whether
they
have
proper
receiving
areas
so
we
don’t
have
carry
and
the
drugs
coming
down
the
same
conveyor
belt,
things
of
this
type.
and
a
security
measure
is
around
the
facility
is
open.
but
the
constitutional
question
is
closed
against
the
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
[laughter]
well,
that’s
what’s
happened.
they
got
into
all
these
other
areas.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
it
could.
we
require
a
certain
physical
safeguard
such
as
a
chain
door
or
a
barrier
of
some
kind
which
can
secure
the
area
from
the
rest
of
the
areas
so
when
they
stock
--
when
they
are
stocking
in
shelves.
they’re
not
walking
in
and
out
of
the
pharmacy
too.
but
they
could
chain
off
an
area
of
some
type
as
long
as
they
are
secured.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
that
they
would
have
declared
our
statute
in
constitution,
you
mean?
mr.
a.
william
lucas
no,
i
don’t
believe
we
could
have
come
here.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
i
think
that
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well
basically,
i
think
it’s
because
they
relied
entirely
on
liggett
versus
baldridge
and
so
as
my
position
on
this
court,
we
think
it
reverse
that
issue.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
because
of
physical
safeguards?
mr.
a.
william
lucas
but
it
would
still
mean
that
our
statute
was
constitutional,
the
ownership
statute.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
we
think
that
raise
us
a
constitutional
question
which
would
allow
us
to
come
here.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
i
think
it’s
basically
just
whether
this
is
a
proper
decision
of
the
court
of
the
--
in
liggett
versus
baldridge
since
they
relied
entirely
on
liggett
versus
baldridge.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
yes,
sir.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
our
statute
is
declared
about
each
of
the
due
process
clause
the
u.s.
constitution
had
--
i
think
it’s
jurisdiction
to
be
here.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
if
our
statute
was
still
determined
to
be
constitutional,
it’s
still
an
event.
i
could
speak
and
use
it
again,
but
i
don’t
think
that
that
would
be
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
which
we
can’t
do
at
this
point.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
that’s
correct.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
no,
we
don’t.
we
think
there’s
still
a
physical
safeguard
problem
but
i
don’t
think
it’s
as
serious
as
the
constitutional
problem.
we
feel
that
professional
pharmacies
are
going
to
offer
certain
services
that
non-professional
pharmacies
may
not.
a
lot
of
these
services
don’t
resolve
in
any
volume
or
profit
or
anything
to
the
pharmacy.
drug
consultation
is
one
item
which
we
feel
that
professionals
will
give
by
counseling
patients
on
interaction
of
drugs
or
incompatibilities
or
abuse
of
this
type.
a
new
area
is
not
too
very
new
but
in
new
jersey,
they
require
a
medication
profile
monitor
and
a
pharmacy
then
keeps
track
of
all
drugs
prescribed
and
dispensed
to
a
particular
patient.
and
if
he
sees
two
or
three
or
four
different
doctors,
the
pharmacy
has
a
record
of
all
items
dispensed
that
that
patient
is
receiving.
we
can
monitor
these
prescriptions
and
then
tell
if
there
are
any
incompatibilities
or
abuse
or
other
date
prescriptions
things
of
this
type.
it
also
offers
delivery,
emergency
hours
and
that
open
charged
accounts
which
a
lot
of
these
larger
chain
store
drugs
don’t.
and
we
feel
that
these
are
professional
services
that
are
related
to
public
health
and
welfare
and
should
be
offered.
now,
we
feel
that
pharmacy
is
a
profession
that’s
been
decided
by
case
law
and
statute
and
we
don’t
feel
that
it
should
be
treated
any
differently
than
a
professional
law,
medicine,
optometry
or
dentistry
that
we
had
two
cases
in
the
u.s.
supreme
court
on
optometry
and
dentistry
which
state
that
a
corporation
cannot
practice
through
licensed
individuals.
those
particular
professions
do
we
feel
that
the
profession
of
pharmacy
should
be
treated
the
same
way.
we
submit
that
the
philosophy
of
liggett
has
been
abandoned
and
we
ask
that
it’d
be
clearly
reversed
to
this
time
and
that
therefore
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
should
also
be
reversed.
subject
to
question
cited
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
we
don't
think
so.
we
want
the
people
in
the
position
on
making
a
policy
to
be
professionals.
a
pharmacist
has
to
yield
to
a
non-professional
if
that
non-professional
owns
the
place.
he
either
says,
you
do
this
or
you
lose
your
job.
and
we
don’t
want
a
professional
yielding
in
being
in
that
position
and
we
want
the
policy
makers
to
be
professionals
so
that
they
will
offer
all
these
services
that
we
think
are
necessary.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
he
is
but
when
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
it
is
your
honor.
but
if
non-owner
says
you
do
this
or
you
lose
your
job,
what
are
you
going
to
do?
mr.
a.
william
lucas
right.
but
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
we
feel
that
the
professionals
to
be
more
sensitive
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
right.
we
feel
that
the
professional
pharmacist
to
be
more
sensitive
in
this
area
of
professional
responsibility
and
professional
service.
and
he
will
not
subordinate
these
objectives
to
commercial
motives.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
they’re
doing
it,
yes
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
we
feel
that
it
is,
your
honor.
also,
i
placed
on
the
responsibility
a
non-pharmacist
is
not
competent
to
really
determine
the
competency
of
a
particular
pharmacist.
and
if
he
is
incompetent
and
there
is
a
misconduct,
he
will
say,
“well,
how
could
i
know?
i’m
not
a
pharmacist.”
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
majority
ownership
means
control.
that
gives
you
the
majority
and
the
board
of
directors
which
determine
policy
and
they
want
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
but
we
think
that
if
they
are
pharmacists,
they
are
going
to
know.
if
they’re
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
i’m
not
sure,
your
honor.
i
mention
to
do
that.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
they
would
be
limited
to
--
well,
one
pharmacist
could
own
more
than
one
pharmacy
under
this
law
if
he
has
majority
of
control
of
each
pharmacy.
we
have
a
local
chain
which
probably
has
six
locations
in
six
major
cities
and
it
could
be
owned
by
one
individual
if
he
had
majority
ownership.
now,
we
want
a
policy
that
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
well,
it
could
be.
but
at
least
this
one
would
ensure
that
you
would
have
some
understanding
of
the
profession
and
--
mr.
a.
william
lucas
no.
but
it
would
be
more
likely
that
he
would
watch
it
and
understand
the
professional
objectives.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
that’s
our
point
that
if
any
state
can
be
conceived
that
that
is
just
a
bias.
if
he
voted
it,
they
must
have
thought
that
they
were
against.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
thank
you.
mr.
a.
william
lucas
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don’t
have
anything
real
urgent.
i’d
like
to
say
that
in
my
return
to
the
motion,
i
admitted
that
there
was
no
question
or
fact
in
regard
to
the
basic
ownership
as
to
who
on
the
stock.
i
think
there’s
an
obvious
question
of
fact
whether
the
statute
is
related
to
the
public
health
and
safety.
and
one
point
as
far
as
relating
it,
i
didn’t
mention.
in
north
dakota
of
course,
we
need
small
town
pharmacies.
and
when
you
get
to
interstate
highways
in
ease
of
chance
--
getting
to
the
bigger
cities,
when
these
chain
stores
advertise
by
of
course
a
motor
oil
for
a
dollar
and
they
all
run
this
mart
to
get
their
motor
oil
and
pick
up
their
prescriptions,
this
hurts
the
small
town
pharmacies.
and
as
a
public
health
requirement
and
necessity,
i
think
that
the
small
towns
have
their
pharmacies,
and
this
is
another
basis
that
could
be
used
to
justify
it.
thank
you.
