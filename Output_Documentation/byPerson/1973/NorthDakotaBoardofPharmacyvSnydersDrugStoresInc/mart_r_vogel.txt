mr.
mart
r.
vogel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
response
to
the
several
questions
that
were
raised
on
the
jurisdictional
issue,
this
is
not
a
final
judgment.
the
judgment
entered
in
the
case
on
the
admit
to
our
by
the
trial
judge
specified
or
directed
the
pharmacy
board
to
hold
a
hearing
on
the
issues
raised
by
the
board
in
connection
with
the
space
for
the
pharmacy
within
60
days.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
take
off
a
few
minutes
to
discuss
the
chronology
of
the
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
i
am
merely
answering
the
question
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
first
raised
and
that
is
whether
or
not
it
is
a
final
judgment.
i
don’t
believe
that
it
gets
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
well,
it’s
the
question
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
that
is
correct.
we
did
not
in
our
brief
say
it.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
my
own
opinion
is,
i
would
like
to
see
a
final
decision
out
of
this
court
under
constitutional
issue.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
while
we
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
indeed,
sir.
we
do.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
i
should
think
that
they
could
based
upon
a
final
judgment,
assuming
for
example
that
the
board’s
finding
with
respect
to
the
space
requirement
were
not
supported
before
the
trial
judge
affirmed
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court.
i
assume
that
they
could
take
the
appeal
then
if
you
were
or
not
the
appeal,
but
could
i
apply
again
for
a
writ
and
if
you
granted
it,
then
we
would
be
back
here.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
we
want
you
to
say
our
court.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
i
am
merely
answering
a
question,
mr.
justice,
about
whether
or
not
the
judgment
was
a
final
one.
and
honestly,
it
isn’t.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
in
fact,
we
were
very
surprised,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
you’re
your
writ
came
down.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes,
i
am
sure
that
it
would
allow
it
and
--
well,
we
overlooked
it.
we
used
to
be
honest
about
it.
i
would
like
to
go
into
this
history
a
little
further
than
it
has
already
been
dealt
out.
because
if
--
i
think
establishes
a
real
purpose,
the
object
that
the
legislature
had
in
passing
this
act.
the
law
in
1963
came
into
being
after
an
unsuccessful
attempt
by
the
board
of
pharmacy
was
made
to
eliminate
by
regulation
doctor-owned
pharmacies.
they
attempted
to
do
that
by
the
passing
of
a
somewhat
similar
statute
except
by
regulation
as
we
have
now
aimed
at
the
positions.
and
of
course,
the
expressed
purpose
of
the
statute
from
the
minutes
of
the
senate
committee
where
this
law
originated
established
that
it
was
to
prevent
doctors
from
taking
over
pharmacies
and
to
supply
the
means
or
the
legal
remedy
to
prevent
that
from
being
done.
now,
mr.
lucas
made
the
statement
that
we
agree
that
doctor-owned
pharmacy
is
or
could
be
an
evil.
we
don’t
admit
that,
we
don’t
concede
it
and
we’ve
never
said
that.
we
merely
indicated
that
there
might
be
assuming
that
there
were
evidence
to
establish
it.
there
might
be
a
legitimate
purpose
in
preventing
physicians
from
also
owning
or
operating
pharmacies.
then
in
1968,
the
family
centered
drugstore
applied
for
a
permit
and
this
was
rejected
by
the
board
of
pharmacy
upon
the
same
grounds
that
the
board
utilized
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
they
do
have.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
they
do
have
the
right.
but
if
i
may
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes,
i
am
familiar
with
the
old
cases.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes
your
honor,
we
have.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
no,
you’ve
never
overruled
it
and
you
have
the
opportunity
of
overruling.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
i
refer
to
the
court
in
the
plural.
in
fact,
i
believe,
it
was
in
1949
that
--
was
it
mr.
justice
clark
who
referred
to
the
liggett
case
indicating
that
it
had
been
narrowed
but
not
stating
that
it
had
been
overruled
and
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
the
state
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
possibly,
the
state
could
do
it
then.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
perhaps
that’s
right.
corporation,
foreign
corporation
coming
into
this
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
because
we
say
that
the
standard
is
still
the
same
as
it
was
in
liggett.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
and
so
is
equal
protection.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes,
i
think
there
are
several
cases
from
this
court
that
lands
support.
the
recent
cases,
the
eisenstadt
case
for
example,
the
lynch
case,
i
think
they
both
came
down
in
1972.
i
think
there’s
the,
is
it
the
goldberg
case
that
came
down
in
1971.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
indicate
that
there
could
be
at
least
some
changing
turnaround
in
the
court’s
deal
of
property
rights
as
compared
to
the
court’s
view
of
liberty
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
i
would
put
the
operation
under
both
due
process
and
equal
protection
and
as
mr.
lucas
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes,
the
right
own
to
property.
and
not
only
corporations,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
also,
this
law
strikes
it
in
individual.
an
individual
account
if
he
is
not
a
pharmacist
owned
a
pharmacy.
and
not
only
that,
but
our
law
is
more
restricted
even
in
the
pennsylvania
statute
license.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
that
of
course
is
true.
and
you
can’t
practice
pharmacy
without
meeting
north
dakota
standards.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
oh,
yes.
as
they
put
it
on
an
ownership
basis,
they
say
that
due
is
not
really
the
operation
of
the
pharmacy.
the
pharmacy
must
still
be
operated
by
a
licensed
pharmacist.
it
must
be
run
and
managed
by
a
licensed
pharmacist
and
we
propose
to
do
that
so
that
when
the
state
comes
in
and
says
that
no
one
except
the
pharmacist
may
own
a
drugstore.
that
is
where
we
say
in
view
of
the
showing
that
we
made
before
the
trial
court.
and
although
mr.
lucas
says
he
had
no
opportunity
of
introducing
any
evidence
to
the
contrary,
he
had
every
opportunity
of
doing
it.
he
could
have
presented
by
deposition
of
course,
by
affidavit
and
he
was
required
to
do
so
under
our
rule
with
respect
to
summary
judgment
and
also
by
the
decisions
of
our
supreme
court.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
well,
your
honor,
given
this
criteria,
if
such
a
statute,
there
is
a
real
substantial
relation
to
public
health
safety
and
morals,
then
yes,
i’d
say
that
it
can.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
well,
the
state
does
so.
and
my
view
is,
our
view
and
i
think
we’ve
suggested
it
in
the
brief
is
that
a
lawyer
and
his
client
is
entirely
or
represents
an
entirely
different
relationship.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
it
is
like
a
physician
and
patient
but
it
is
not
like
a
physician
and
pharmacist
or
a
physician
and
drugstore.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
it
would
be.
and
mr.
lucas
in
his
return
to
our
motion
for
summary
judgment
flatly
stated
that
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
issue,
it
is
solely
when
at
law
and
he
produced
no
evidence
which
he
couldn’t.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
well,
under
our
rule
as
i
remember,
it
must
be
more
than
mere
argument.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
well,
perhaps
that
i
guess
is
right.
but
before
the
lower
court,
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever
of
any
factual
situations
which
could
result
in
upholding
the
statute
as
being
one
bearing
substantially
upon
public
health,
safety
or
welfare.
there
wasn’t
the
slightest
indication.
and
as
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota
pointed
out,
there
was
no
assurance.
but
if
the
court
had
sent
this
back
for
an
evidentiary
hearing,
what
evidence
would
or
could
be
produced?
in
reading
the
briefs
submitted
by
the
appellant
and
the
amicus,
these
imaginary
situations
which
they
call
attention
to
as
text
are
the
credulity.
i
would
think
of
an
impartial
judge
--i’m
not
being
[laughter
attempt]
of
course,
but
my
--
to
contend
that
the
chain
store
drug
business
is
interested
only
in
commercialization
that
the
drugs
that
they
put
out
could
be
poor
drugs.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
well
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
that’s
what
i
think.
surely,
if
the
recent
expressions
of
this
court
in
the
cases
that
i
quoted
from
that
you
handed
down
last
term
our
indication.
we
are
still
on
the
proposition
of
the
statute
cannot
be
based
upon
imaginary
ills
that
could
be
dredged
up.
but
the
statute
must
bear
a
substantial
relationship
to
the
public
health,
safety
and
morals.
and
furthermore,
we
have
pointed
out
that
this
statute,
the
object
of
it,
and
i
think
that’s
indicated
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
the
only
committee
minutes
which
could
be
located,
the
object
was
to
prevent
doctors
from
taking
over
the
pharmacy
business
and
to
the
detriment
of
the
local
drugstore
owner.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
i
think
the
argument
is
made
and
i
think
it
was
raised
in
california
that
if
a
doctor
owns
a
drugstore,
when
a
patient
comes
to
him,
he’s
going
to
see
to
it
that
the
drug
business
is
funneled
into
his
own
drugstore.
and
he
may
be
over
prescribing
drugs.
i
guess
probably
that
was
contended
in
the
california
case
too
because
he
has
an
interest
in
the
drugstore.
i
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes.
the
snyder
drug,
your
honor,
have
i
think
something
like
35
or
37
drugstores.
they
operate
in
five
midwestern
states,
minnesota,
iowa
and
so
on,
and
they’ve
been
in
the
business
for
a
long
time.
i
think
they
employ
something
like
120
pharmacists.
they
are
very
highly
and
reputable
organization,
and
very
efficient
one.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
oh,
yes!
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes,
your
honor.
all
of
the
stock
is.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
from
my
own
knowledge,
and
i
think
it’s
common
knowledge
in
north
dakota,
there
are
a
number.
in
fact,
in
fargo,
i
think
all
three
of
the
large
medical
groups
have
their
own
pharmacies.
it’s
a
very
efficient
way
of
handling
the
drug
problem
to
have
physician’s
clinics
or
individual
doctors.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
other
than
this
statute?
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
well,
california
as
you
know
has
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
such
a
statute.
i
very
seriously
question
its
constitutionality.
i
have
seen
some
definite
proof
that
out
of
our
way,
the
physician
that
doesn’t
operate
ethically
and
would
do
the
kind
of
act
which
the
--
such
a
statute
would
be
aimed
at.
so,
i’d
still
say
that
there
would
have
to
be
some
indication
once
the
statute
is
attacked
that
it
does
not
--
or
rather
that
it
does,
i
withdraw
that.
rather
that
it
does,
there
are
real
and
substantial
relationship
to
the
public
health
safety
and
the
morals
of
the
public.
mr.
lucas
did
not
respond
to
the
issue
on
the
commerce
clause
that
was
raised
by
the
national
association
of
chain
drugstores
in
his
brief.
he
now
says
that
it
shouldn’t
be
considered
because
it
wasn’t
raised
in
the
lower
court.
we
hope
that
you
do
consider
it
because
we
think
that
it
is
applicable.
we’re
sorry
that
we
did
overlook
it
in
the
lower
court
proceeding.
but
surely,
where
an
institution
such
as
snyder
drugs
with
its
large
area
of
operation
in
these
five
different
states
that
i’ve
mentioned
to
be
prevented
from
crossing
state
lines
for
the
purpose
of
distributing
its
product.
our
judgment
or
in
the
judgment
of
the
amicus
which
we
adapt,
there
is
a
very
definite
interference
with
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution.
and
in
fact,
in
the
same
note
of
the
committee
meetings,
i
think
one
of
the
legislators
referred
to
this
statute,
this
fence
legislation.
put
up
the
fence
around
north
dakota
so
that
outsiders’
chain
drugstores
could
not
enter.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
no.
your
honor,
i
can’t
agree.
i
think
that
that
very
definitely
would
be
interfering
with
interstate
commerce.
aside
from
the
drugstore
business
chains
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
well,
i
can
only
go
back
to
the
standard.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes,
sir.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes,
i
do.
we
also
had
a
proposal
by
one
legislature
during
the
early
30’s
at
north
dakota
see
sead
from
the
union.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
a
bill
--
honestly
was
introduced
to
that
effect.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
well,
it
would’ve
solved
this
problem
obviously.
we
wouldn’t
be
here.
but
with
just
several
minutes
left,
i
really
want
to
say
that
we’re
not
contending
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
intended
to
interfere
with
a
reasonable
exercise
or
the
police
power.
we
do
contend
that
the
act
here
is
unreasonable
and
that
the
evidence
produced
by
snyder’s
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
before
the
trial
court
to
the
effect
that
it’s
conducted
a
drug
business
would
be
under
north
dakota
pharmacist
strictly
for
the
people’s
benefit
and
not
because
of
the
post
regulation
by
federal
state
statutes
and
the
regulation
promulgated
under
those
statutes
that
there
just
is
no
reason
for
this
law
because
there
isn’t
any
evil.
and
we
don’t
think
that
you
have
abandoned
entirely
the
--
and
you
haven’t
abandoned
this
proposition
of
liggett
that
the
legislative
means
must
substantially
further
legislative
ends.
or
at
the
very
least,
we
say
that
there
must
be
a
showing
made
by
the
state
of
a
minimal
rational
means
and
relationship
to
that
--
the
object
of
the
statute.
we
just
maintained
that
the
statute
makes
no
sense.
in
so
far
as
the
public
health
welfare
does
make
sense,
if
the
purpose
was
to
keep
the
druggist
in
business,
it
could
make
some
sense
assuming
proof
again
that
the
physician
should
not
own
a
drugstore.
thank
you.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
in
response
to
the
several
questions
that
were
raised
on
the
jurisdictional
issue,
this
is
not
a
final
judgment.
the
judgment
entered
in
the
case
on
the
admit
to
our
by
the
trial
judge
specified
or
directed
the
pharmacy
board
to
hold
a
hearing
on
the
issues
raised
by
the
board
in
connection
with
the
space
for
the
pharmacy
within
60
days.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
take
off
a
few
minutes
to
discuss
the
chronology
of
the
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
i
am
merely
answering
the
question
that
mr.
justice
rehnquist
first
raised
and
that
is
whether
or
not
it
is
a
final
judgment.
i
don’t
believe
that
it
gets
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
well,
it’s
the
question
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
that
is
correct.
we
did
not
in
our
brief
say
it.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
my
own
opinion
is,
i
would
like
to
see
a
final
decision
out
of
this
court
under
constitutional
issue.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
while
we
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
indeed,
sir.
we
do.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
i
should
think
that
they
could
based
upon
a
final
judgment,
assuming
for
example
that
the
board’s
finding
with
respect
to
the
space
requirement
were
not
supported
before
the
trial
judge
affirmed
on
appeal
to
the
supreme
court.
i
assume
that
they
could
take
the
appeal
then
if
you
were
or
not
the
appeal,
but
could
i
apply
again
for
a
writ
and
if
you
granted
it,
then
we
would
be
back
here.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
we
want
you
to
say
our
court.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
i
am
merely
answering
a
question,
mr.
justice,
about
whether
or
not
the
judgment
was
a
final
one.
and
honestly,
it
isn’t.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
in
fact,
we
were
very
surprised,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
you’re
your
writ
came
down.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes,
i
am
sure
that
it
would
allow
it
and
--
well,
we
overlooked
it.
we
used
to
be
honest
about
it.
i
would
like
to
go
into
this
history
a
little
further
than
it
has
already
been
dealt
out.
because
if
--
i
think
establishes
a
real
purpose,
the
object
that
the
legislature
had
in
passing
this
act.
the
law
in
1963
came
into
being
after
an
unsuccessful
attempt
by
the
board
of
pharmacy
was
made
to
eliminate
by
regulation
doctor-owned
pharmacies.
they
attempted
to
do
that
by
the
passing
of
a
somewhat
similar
statute
except
by
regulation
as
we
have
now
aimed
at
the
positions.
and
of
course,
the
expressed
purpose
of
the
statute
from
the
minutes
of
the
senate
committee
where
this
law
originated
established
that
it
was
to
prevent
doctors
from
taking
over
pharmacies
and
to
supply
the
means
or
the
legal
remedy
to
prevent
that
from
being
done.
now,
mr.
lucas
made
the
statement
that
we
agree
that
doctor-owned
pharmacy
is
or
could
be
an
evil.
we
don’t
admit
that,
we
don’t
concede
it
and
we’ve
never
said
that.
we
merely
indicated
that
there
might
be
assuming
that
there
were
evidence
to
establish
it.
there
might
be
a
legitimate
purpose
in
preventing
physicians
from
also
owning
or
operating
pharmacies.
then
in
1968,
the
family
centered
drugstore
applied
for
a
permit
and
this
was
rejected
by
the
board
of
pharmacy
upon
the
same
grounds
that
the
board
utilized
in
the
instant
case.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
they
do
have.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
they
do
have
the
right.
but
if
i
may
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes,
i
am
familiar
with
the
old
cases.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes
your
honor,
we
have.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
no,
you’ve
never
overruled
it
and
you
have
the
opportunity
of
overruling.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
i
refer
to
the
court
in
the
plural.
in
fact,
i
believe,
it
was
in
1949
that
--
was
it
mr.
justice
clark
who
referred
to
the
liggett
case
indicating
that
it
had
been
narrowed
but
not
stating
that
it
had
been
overruled
and
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
the
state
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
possibly,
the
state
could
do
it
then.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
perhaps
that’s
right.
corporation,
foreign
corporation
coming
into
this
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
because
we
say
that
the
standard
is
still
the
same
as
it
was
in
liggett.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
and
so
is
equal
protection.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
i
beg
your
pardon
sir?
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes,
i
think
there
are
several
cases
from
this
court
that
lands
support.
the
recent
cases,
the
eisenstadt
case
for
example,
the
lynch
case,
i
think
they
both
came
down
in
1972.
i
think
there’s
the,
is
it
the
goldberg
case
that
came
down
in
1971.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
cases
that
indicate
that
there
could
be
at
least
some
changing
turnaround
in
the
court’s
deal
of
property
rights
as
compared
to
the
court’s
view
of
liberty
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
i
would
put
the
operation
under
both
due
process
and
equal
protection
and
as
mr.
lucas
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes,
the
right
own
to
property.
and
not
only
corporations,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
also,
this
law
strikes
it
in
individual.
an
individual
account
if
he
is
not
a
pharmacist
owned
a
pharmacy.
and
not
only
that,
but
our
law
is
more
restricted
even
in
the
pennsylvania
statute
license.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
that
of
course
is
true.
and
you
can’t
practice
pharmacy
without
meeting
north
dakota
standards.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
oh,
yes.
as
they
put
it
on
an
ownership
basis,
they
say
that
due
is
not
really
the
operation
of
the
pharmacy.
the
pharmacy
must
still
be
operated
by
a
licensed
pharmacist.
it
must
be
run
and
managed
by
a
licensed
pharmacist
and
we
propose
to
do
that
so
that
when
the
state
comes
in
and
says
that
no
one
except
the
pharmacist
may
own
a
drugstore.
that
is
where
we
say
in
view
of
the
showing
that
we
made
before
the
trial
court.
and
although
mr.
lucas
says
he
had
no
opportunity
of
introducing
any
evidence
to
the
contrary,
he
had
every
opportunity
of
doing
it.
he
could
have
presented
by
deposition
of
course,
by
affidavit
and
he
was
required
to
do
so
under
our
rule
with
respect
to
summary
judgment
and
also
by
the
decisions
of
our
supreme
court.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
well,
your
honor,
given
this
criteria,
if
such
a
statute,
there
is
a
real
substantial
relation
to
public
health
safety
and
morals,
then
yes,
i’d
say
that
it
can.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
well,
the
state
does
so.
and
my
view
is,
our
view
and
i
think
we’ve
suggested
it
in
the
brief
is
that
a
lawyer
and
his
client
is
entirely
or
represents
an
entirely
different
relationship.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
it
is
like
a
physician
and
patient
but
it
is
not
like
a
physician
and
pharmacist
or
a
physician
and
drugstore.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
it
would
be.
and
mr.
lucas
in
his
return
to
our
motion
for
summary
judgment
flatly
stated
that
with
respect
to
the
constitutional
issue,
it
is
solely
when
at
law
and
he
produced
no
evidence
which
he
couldn’t.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
well,
under
our
rule
as
i
remember,
it
must
be
more
than
mere
argument.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
well,
perhaps
that
i
guess
is
right.
but
before
the
lower
court,
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever
of
any
factual
situations
which
could
result
in
upholding
the
statute
as
being
one
bearing
substantially
upon
public
health,
safety
or
welfare.
there
wasn’t
the
slightest
indication.
and
as
the
supreme
court
of
north
dakota
pointed
out,
there
was
no
assurance.
but
if
the
court
had
sent
this
back
for
an
evidentiary
hearing,
what
evidence
would
or
could
be
produced?
in
reading
the
briefs
submitted
by
the
appellant
and
the
amicus,
these
imaginary
situations
which
they
call
attention
to
as
text
are
the
credulity.
i
would
think
of
an
impartial
judge
--i’m
not
being
[laughter
attempt]
of
course,
but
my
--
to
contend
that
the
chain
store
drug
business
is
interested
only
in
commercialization
that
the
drugs
that
they
put
out
could
be
poor
drugs.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
well
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
that’s
what
i
think.
surely,
if
the
recent
expressions
of
this
court
in
the
cases
that
i
quoted
from
that
you
handed
down
last
term
our
indication.
we
are
still
on
the
proposition
of
the
statute
cannot
be
based
upon
imaginary
ills
that
could
be
dredged
up.
but
the
statute
must
bear
a
substantial
relationship
to
the
public
health,
safety
and
morals.
and
furthermore,
we
have
pointed
out
that
this
statute,
the
object
of
it,
and
i
think
that’s
indicated
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
the
only
committee
minutes
which
could
be
located,
the
object
was
to
prevent
doctors
from
taking
over
the
pharmacy
business
and
to
the
detriment
of
the
local
drugstore
owner.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
i
think
the
argument
is
made
and
i
think
it
was
raised
in
california
that
if
a
doctor
owns
a
drugstore,
when
a
patient
comes
to
him,
he’s
going
to
see
to
it
that
the
drug
business
is
funneled
into
his
own
drugstore.
and
he
may
be
over
prescribing
drugs.
i
guess
probably
that
was
contended
in
the
california
case
too
because
he
has
an
interest
in
the
drugstore.
i
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes.
the
snyder
drug,
your
honor,
have
i
think
something
like
35
or
37
drugstores.
they
operate
in
five
midwestern
states,
minnesota,
iowa
and
so
on,
and
they’ve
been
in
the
business
for
a
long
time.
i
think
they
employ
something
like
120
pharmacists.
they
are
very
highly
and
reputable
organization,
and
very
efficient
one.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
oh,
yes!
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes,
your
honor.
all
of
the
stock
is.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
from
my
own
knowledge,
and
i
think
it’s
common
knowledge
in
north
dakota,
there
are
a
number.
in
fact,
in
fargo,
i
think
all
three
of
the
large
medical
groups
have
their
own
pharmacies.
it’s
a
very
efficient
way
of
handling
the
drug
problem
to
have
physician’s
clinics
or
individual
doctors.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
other
than
this
statute?
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
well,
california
as
you
know
has
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
such
a
statute.
i
very
seriously
question
its
constitutionality.
i
have
seen
some
definite
proof
that
out
of
our
way,
the
physician
that
doesn’t
operate
ethically
and
would
do
the
kind
of
act
which
the
--
such
a
statute
would
be
aimed
at.
so,
i’d
still
say
that
there
would
have
to
be
some
indication
once
the
statute
is
attacked
that
it
does
not
--
or
rather
that
it
does,
i
withdraw
that.
rather
that
it
does,
there
are
real
and
substantial
relationship
to
the
public
health
safety
and
the
morals
of
the
public.
mr.
lucas
did
not
respond
to
the
issue
on
the
commerce
clause
that
was
raised
by
the
national
association
of
chain
drugstores
in
his
brief.
he
now
says
that
it
shouldn’t
be
considered
because
it
wasn’t
raised
in
the
lower
court.
we
hope
that
you
do
consider
it
because
we
think
that
it
is
applicable.
we’re
sorry
that
we
did
overlook
it
in
the
lower
court
proceeding.
but
surely,
where
an
institution
such
as
snyder
drugs
with
its
large
area
of
operation
in
these
five
different
states
that
i’ve
mentioned
to
be
prevented
from
crossing
state
lines
for
the
purpose
of
distributing
its
product.
our
judgment
or
in
the
judgment
of
the
amicus
which
we
adapt,
there
is
a
very
definite
interference
with
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution.
and
in
fact,
in
the
same
note
of
the
committee
meetings,
i
think
one
of
the
legislators
referred
to
this
statute,
this
fence
legislation.
put
up
the
fence
around
north
dakota
so
that
outsiders’
chain
drugstores
could
not
enter.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
no.
your
honor,
i
can’t
agree.
i
think
that
that
very
definitely
would
be
interfering
with
interstate
commerce.
aside
from
the
drugstore
business
chains
--
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
well,
i
can
only
go
back
to
the
standard.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes,
sir.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
yes,
i
do.
we
also
had
a
proposal
by
one
legislature
during
the
early
30’s
at
north
dakota
see
sead
from
the
union.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
a
bill
--
honestly
was
introduced
to
that
effect.
mr.
mart
r.
vogel
well,
it
would’ve
solved
this
problem
obviously.
we
wouldn’t
be
here.
but
with
just
several
minutes
left,
i
really
want
to
say
that
we’re
not
contending
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
intended
to
interfere
with
a
reasonable
exercise
or
the
police
power.
we
do
contend
that
the
act
here
is
unreasonable
and
that
the
evidence
produced
by
snyder’s
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
before
the
trial
court
to
the
effect
that
it’s
conducted
a
drug
business
would
be
under
north
dakota
pharmacist
strictly
for
the
people’s
benefit
and
not
because
of
the
post
regulation
by
federal
state
statutes
and
the
regulation
promulgated
under
those
statutes
that
there
just
is
no
reason
for
this
law
because
there
isn’t
any
evil.
and
we
don’t
think
that
you
have
abandoned
entirely
the
--
and
you
haven’t
abandoned
this
proposition
of
liggett
that
the
legislative
means
must
substantially
further
legislative
ends.
or
at
the
very
least,
we
say
that
there
must
be
a
showing
made
by
the
state
of
a
minimal
rational
means
and
relationship
to
that
--
the
object
of
the
statute.
we
just
maintained
that
the
statute
makes
no
sense.
in
so
far
as
the
public
health
welfare
does
make
sense,
if
the
purpose
was
to
keep
the
druggist
in
business,
it
could
make
some
sense
assuming
proof
again
that
the
physician
should
not
own
a
drugstore.
thank
you.
