unknown
speaker
mr.
lucas,
what
is,
in
your
opinion,
is
the
real
purpose
behind
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
well
historically,
you
know
what
the
impetus
was
and
its
enactment
in
north
dakota
or
minnesota
or
south
dakota?
unknown
speaker
precisely.
and
what
has
that
therefore
to
do
with
public
health?
i
think
you’re
quite
correct
when
you
made
that
statement
and
i
--
unknown
speaker
it’s
ethical
not
a
public
health
approach,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
on
this
approach,
however,
what
justifies
then
the
hospital
exemption
on
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
presumably,
a
physician
own
a
pharmacy
would
be
supervised
by
a
physician?
unknown
speaker
well,
or
some
place
hospitals
are
owned
by
physicians.
unknown
speaker
i
have
one
last
question.
suppose
a
pharmacist
owning
a
drug
store
sells
his
stock
down
to
49%,
what
happens
as
a
practical
matter?
does
he
have
to
go
out
of
business?
does
the
place
have
to
go
out
of
business?
unknown
speaker
yes,
to
a
non-pharmacist.
unknown
speaker
would
your
board
then
put
the
put
them
on
a
business?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
was
distinct,
ethical
problem
at
one
time
perhaps
still
is.
you’ve
heard
of
the
california
situation.
unknown
speaker
but
isn’t
all
of
that
equally
true
with
pharmacist’s
own
pharmacy?
unknown
speaker
how
can
we
be
sure
in
one
fact?
if
your
opponents
prevail
here,
i
take
it
they
do
not
object
to
any
provision
that
the
pharmacy
itself
shall
be
run
by
a
registered
pharmacist?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lucas,
how
many
states
have
statutes
as
rigorous
as
this
requiring
that
only
pharmacists
may
own
drugstores?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying,
the
state
of
new
york
does
not
allow
chain
drug
stores?
unknown
speaker
oh!
unknown
speaker
vetoed.
oh!
well,
the
arguments
you
make
in
support
of
a
rational
basis
for
this
statute
are
not
in
the
record,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
you
think
you
could
produce
evidence?
unknown
speaker
despite
the
experience
in
48
other
states?
unknown
speaker
when
was
the
statute
enacted?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
documentary
legislative
history
that
one
can
get
from
your
state
legislature,
mr.
lucas?
unknown
speaker
without
hearings
transcribed
in?
unknown
speaker
how
far
back
was
it
for
this
kind
of
law
to
go
in
your
state?
unknown
speaker
but
we
thought
it
was
one
in
1920?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lucas,
i
am
not
sure
i
could
hear
mr.
justice
powell’s
question
and
i
may
be
repetitious
here.
if
you
should
prevail,
would
you
wish
to
have
the
case
remanded
for
the
development
of
a
record
on
the
issue
of
public
health?
unknown
speaker
you
said
earlier
that
the
constitutional
question
was
closed?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don’t
understand
why
this
should
be
opened
or
closed
been
right?
unknown
speaker
do
you
also
stop
the
drugstore
from
selling
attract
us
too,
while
they
have
it?
unknown
speaker
now,
let’s
assume
that
the
supreme
court
of
your
state
had
affirmed
on
both
grounds
that
these
people
were
entitled
--
let’s
assume
that
they
affirmed
on
both
grounds,
would
you
come
here?
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
they
also
said
that
they
were
not
entitled
for
another
reason.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
--
why
did
you
come
here
now
then?
unknown
speaker
because
both
grounds
were
before
the
--
before
your
supreme
court.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
they
still
may
not
be
entitled
to
the
license.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that
may
be
so.
but
let
us
just
say,
if
the
supreme
court
had
said
when
the
statute
is
unconstitutional,
but
these
people
are
not
entitled
to
do
it
anyway
for
another
reason
based
on
state
law.
you
couldn’t
have
come
here
just
because
they
declared
your
statute
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
there
is
an
adequate
state
ground
for
that
kind
of
decision
that
justice
white
is
talking
about
that
whether
they
win
or
lose
on
the
constitutional
question,
they’ll
still
be
barred
by
a
decision
that’s
adequately
based
on
state
grounds.
unknown
speaker
so,
i
don’t
--
is
that
the
difference
been
than
the
case--
then
the
case
comes
to
us
narrow
or
it
doesn’t
seem
to
me
to
be
very
much
different?
unknown
speaker
we
are
talking
about
our
jurisdiction,
that’s
what
we’re
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
this
just
another
way
of
uttering
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question
about
the
finality
of
your
judgment
and
it’s
obvious
that
the
justices
in
either
side
of
me
have
some
questions
about
it.
unknown
speaker
what
we
would
have
to
do
in
the
meantime
would
be
to
try
to
enforce
the
statute
in
the
face
of
the
adverse
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
your
own
states.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you’d
also
have
a
final
judgment
since
if
you
conceded
--
if
the
board
not
conceded,
otherwise
these
people
are
entitled
to
others
aside
from
the
stock
ownership
that
these
people
are
entitled
the
license?
unknown
speaker
do
you,
yes
you
don’t
or
do
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lucas,
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
i
think
that
we’d
all
agree
that
practicing
the
profession
of
pharmacy
could
be
accomplished
only
by
a
licensed
pharmacist.
but
here,
we
are
talking
about
ownership.
would
you
not
accomplish
of
the
essential
objectives
of
your
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
the
pharmacist
himself
drawn
by
the
rules
of
the
pharmacist
association
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
is
it
offensive
from
doing
such
thing?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
a
choice
of
losing
your
license
or
your
job?
unknown
speaker
it’s
your
choice.
unknown
speaker
it
is
your
choice
to
make.
unknown
speaker
and
the
pharmacists
in
north
dakota,
they
have
enough
money
to
run
these
thing?
unknown
speaker
if
he
refused
to
commit
the
illegal
act,
someone,
not
a
pharmacist
might
carry
out
the
illegal
act.
give
a
prescription
that
should
not
be
given.
give
a
medicine
without
a
prescription
which
should
not
have
been
done
and
thereby
the
public
health
is
injured.
unknown
speaker
i
have
big
problem
about
this
stockholders
running
to
pharmacist.
i
would
think
the
stockholder
wants
to
return
on
his
money.
he
is
not
doing
if
you
can
have
it
whether
you
filled
this
prescription
or
not,
the
stockholders
are
not
going
to
supervise
the
pharmacist
about
it.
unknown
speaker
as
to
provide
the
new
comer
or
a
new
batlle
wise
it
or
what
have
you
but
i
would
assume
that
every
stockholder
wouldn’t
even
know
what
a
drug
was,
right?
unknown
speaker
how
many
pharmacists
do
you
have
now
at
the
court?
unknown
speaker
because
one,
whether
you
don’t
limit
the
number
of
pharmacists
that
way.
unknown
speaker
and
it
could
be
that
the
pharmacies
under
the
owner
has
given
up
his
pharmacy
just
to
collect
his
money,
couldn’t
it
be?
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn’t
be
sure
that
he
practice
it,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
ask
before
anything.
are
you
suggesting
there
is
no
jurisdictional
question
in
line
to
which
you
just
said?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it’s
not?
what
if
it’s
not,
what
happen
to
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
i
noticed,
in
your
response
in
the
petition
per
se,
in
jurisdiction,
you
simply
have
a
sentence.
this
panel
does
not
question
the
jurisdiction
of
the
said
court.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
even
though
--
i
know
everyone
who
comes
here
would
like
i
can
do
that.
but
we
do
have
limitations
of
jurisdiction
to
the
court.
unknown
speaker
what
if
there’s
no
jurisdiction
here,
the
dismissal
still
got
the
benefit
of
their
own
state
supreme
court
having
declared
unconstitutional
on
the
statute.
you
won’t
declare
that?
unknown
speaker
want
us
through
say
it
work,
it
right?
unknown
speaker
even
though
you
--
we
have
the
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
it’s
been
difficult
for
me
to
sit
here
and
imagine
that
liggett
is
still
good
law.
i’ve
been
here
quite
a
while
and
never
been
here
as
i
recalled
before
asking
for
reaffirmation
of
it,
reaffirmation
of
the
principle.
it
belongs
to
some
i've
cover
it.
[laughter
attempt]
it
passed
into
the
limbo.
unknown
speaker
why
doesn’t
the
state
have
the
right
to
control
corporations
doing
business
in
the
state?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
because
this
is
the
old
substantive
due
process.
this
is
the
old
cases.
well
you
know
it.
you’re
familiar
with
them.
unknown
speaker
counsel
for
liggett
was
owen
j.
roberts.
owen
j.
roberts
later
sit
on
this
court.
owen
j.
roberts
was
a
great
advocate
of
substantive
due
process
which
is
alright.
i
mean,
that
is
a
permissible
--
but
i
just
can’t
imagine.
i
might
shepardize
this
thing
to
see
if
this
actually
still
exists.
have
you
shepardize
it?
unknown
speaker
aren’t
you
astounded
that
it’s
still
around?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
personally
have?
unknown
speaker
why
couldn’t
the
state
say
that
the
corporations
can’t
be
use
at
all
in
this
peddling
of
drugs?
unknown
speaker
pardon?
unknown
speaker
then
what’s
--
how
can
you
justify
this
in
terms
of
modern
points
or
reference
to
the
constitution
as
we
know?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
still
on
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
there’s
griswold
against
connecticut
and
there’s
rowe
and
there’s
doe.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
only.
but
you
wouldn’t
say
that
no
corporation
can
own
a
pharmacy?
unknown
speaker
could
north
dakota
pass
a
law
saying
that
a
pharmacy
cannot
be
owned
by
a
corporations?
and
i
am
going
to
combine
that
law
and
medicine,
right
after
you
answer.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
can
the
--
say
a
lawyer
cannot
practice
as
a
corporation?
unknown
speaker
like
a
physician
--
unknown
speaker
well,
under
your
law.
but
under
the
federal
constitution
law
of
the
state,
it
directly
says
that
there’s
no
need
for
evidence
if
is
using
a
gradual
basis.
unknown
speaker
your
client
is
hooked
up
with
a
big
chain?
unknown
speaker
supermarket
chain?
unknown
speaker
mr.
vogel,
perhaps
you’ve
answered
this.
if
so,
i
missed
it
and
of
course,
this
isn’t
your
case.
but
what
would
be
your
position
if
the
pharmacy
boards
regulation
was
nearly
directed
at
physicians
owning
pharmacies?
unknown
speaker
so
that
in
your
state
then,
there
is
no
pharmacy
board
barrier
against
that
kind
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
the
ownership
one.
if
the
board
has
turn
around
and
do
away
with
this
one
but
say
that
physicians
should
not
own
pharmacies,
then
what
would
be
your
attitude?
again,
i
say
this
isn’t
your
case.
i
understand
an
unanswered
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
be
a
legitimate
statement.
i
like
your
state
very
much,
there
are
many
times.
i
don’t
know
its
problems.
but
i
could
just
see
how
people
live
in
there,
you
don’t
have
many
people,
how
north
dakota
might
become
a
subject
of
exploitations
by
delaware
corporation
around
the
country
using
little
vacuum
cleaner
to
suck
out
from
north
dakota
all
the
money
possible
and
leaving
nothing
behind
by
which
a
tax
base
can
be
laid
and
the
schools
built
and
so
on.
i
can
see
a
state
to
saying
we
are
going
to
stop
that.
i
don’t
see
why
that
would
not
follow
that.
a
good
category
is
health,
certain
welfare,
welfare
in
the
sense
of
welfare
of
the
people,
don’t
you
agree?
unknown
speaker
i
was
not
talking
about
stopping
--
removing
the
good.
i
was
talking
about
requiring
every
druggist
in
the
state.
every
merchant
in
the
state
to
could
be
a
single
entrepreneur.
unknown
speaker
you
got
some
big
revolutions
in
north
dakota.
our
court
sustained
in
1920
here.
unknown
speaker
remember
that?
unknown
speaker
have
you
considered
that
recently?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
that
might
have
solved
turtle
mountain
problem
in
the
last
case.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
lucas,
what
is,
in
your
opinion,
is
the
real
purpose
behind
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
well
historically,
you
know
what
the
impetus

its

have
come
here
just
because
they
declared
your
statute
unconstitutional.
unknown
speaker
there
is
an
adequate
state
ground
for
that
kind
of
decision
that
justice
white
is
talking
about
that
whether
they
win
or
lose
on
the
constitutional
question,
they’ll
still
be
barred
by
a
decision
that’s
adequately
based
on
state
grounds.
unknown
speaker
so,
i
don’t
--
is
that
the
difference
been
than
the
case--
then
the
case
comes
to
us
narrow
or
it
doesn’t
seem
to
me
to
be
very
much
different?
unknown
speaker
we
are
talking
about
our
jurisdiction,
that’s
what
we’re
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
this
just
another
way
of
uttering
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question
about
the
finality
of
your
judgment
and
it’s
obvious
that
the
justices
in
either
side
of
me
have
some
questions
about
it.
unknown
speaker
what
we
would
have
to
do
in
the
meantime
would
be
to
try
to
enforce
the
statute
in
the
face
of
the
adverse
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
your
own
states.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you’d
also
have
a
final
judgment
since
if
you
conceded
--
if
the
board
not
conceded,
otherwise
these
people
are
entitled
to
others
aside
from
the
stock
ownership
that
these
people
are
entitled
the
license?
unknown
speaker
do
you,
yes
you
don’t
or
do
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lucas,
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question?
i
think
that
we’d
all
agree
that
practicing
the
profession
of
pharmacy
could
be
accomplished
only
by
a
licensed
pharmacist.
but
here,
we
are
talking
about
ownership.
would
you
not
accomplish
of
the
essential
objectives
of
your
law?
unknown
speaker
well,
isn’t
the
pharmacist
himself
drawn
by
the
rules
of
the
pharmacist
association
of
the
state?
unknown
speaker
is
it
offensive
from
doing
such
thing?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
a
choice
of
losing
your
license
or
your
job?
unknown
speaker
it’s
your
choice.
unknown
speaker
it
is
your
choice
to
make.
unknown
speaker
and
the
pharmacists
in
north
dakota,
they
have
enough
money
to
run
these
thing?
unknown
speaker
if
he
refused
to
commit
the
illegal
act,
someone,
not
a
pharmacist
might
carry
out
the
illegal
act.
give
a
prescription
that
should
not
be
given.
give
a
medicine
without
a
prescription
which
should
not
have
been
done
and
thereby
the
public
health
is
injured.
unknown
speaker
i
have
big
problem
about
this
stockholders
running
to
pharmacist.
i
would
think
the
stockholder
wants
to
return
on
his
money.
he
is
not
doing
if
you
can
have
it
whether
you
filled
this
prescription
or
not,
the
stockholders
are
not
going
to
supervise
the
pharmacist
about
it.
unknown
speaker
as
to
provide
the
new
comer
or
a
new
batlle
wise
it
or
what
have
you
but
i
would
assume
that
every
stockholder
wouldn’t
even
know
what
a
drug
was,
right?
unknown
speaker
how
many
pharmacists
do
you
have
now
at
the
court?
unknown
speaker
because
one,
whether
you
don’t
limit
the
number
of
pharmacists
that
way.
unknown
speaker
and
it
could
be
that
the
pharmacies
under
the
owner
has
given
up
his
pharmacy
just
to
collect
his
money,
couldn’t
it
be?
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn’t
be
sure
that
he
practice
it,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
ask
before
anything.
are
you
suggesting
there
is
no
jurisdictional
question
in
line
to
which
you
just
said?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it’s
not?
what
if
it’s
not,
what
happen
to
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
i
noticed,
in
your
response
in
the
petition
per
se,
in
jurisdiction,
you
simply
have
a
sentence.
this
panel
does
not
question
the
jurisdiction
of
the
said
court.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
even
though
--
i
know
everyone
who
comes
here
would
like
i
can
do
that.
but
we
do
have
limitations
of
jurisdiction
to
the
court.
unknown
speaker
what
if
there’s
no
jurisdiction
here,
the
dismissal
still
got
the
benefit
of
their
own
state
supreme
court
having
declared
unconstitutional
on
the
statute.
you
won’t
declare
that?
unknown
speaker
want
us
through
say
it
work,
it
right?
unknown
speaker
even
though
you
--
we
have
the
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
it’s
been
difficult
for
me
to
sit
here
and
imagine
that
liggett
is
still
good
law.
i’ve
been
here
quite
a
while
and
never
been
here
as
i
recalled
before
asking
for
reaffirmation
of
it,
reaffirmation
of
the
principle.
it
belongs
to
some
i've
cover
it.
[laughter
attempt]
it
passed
into
the
limbo.
unknown
speaker
why
doesn’t
the
state
have
the
right
to
control
corporations
doing
business
in
the
state?
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
because
this
is
the
old
substantive
due
process.
this
is
the
old
cases.
well
you
know
it.
you’re
familiar
with
them.
unknown
speaker
counsel
for
liggett
was
owen
j.
roberts.
owen
j.
roberts
later
sit
on
this
court.
owen
j.
roberts
was
a
great
advocate
of
substantive
due
process
which
is
alright.
i
mean,
that
is
a
permissible
--
but
i
just
can’t
imagine.
i
might
shepardize
this
thing
to
see
if
this
actually
still
exists.
have
you
shepardize
it?
unknown
speaker
aren’t
you
astounded
that
it’s
still
around?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
personally
have?
unknown
speaker
why
couldn’t
the
state
say
that
the
corporations
can’t
be
use
at
all
in
this
peddling
of
drugs?
unknown
speaker
pardon?
unknown
speaker
then
what’s
--
how
can
you
justify
this
in
terms
of
modern
points
or
reference
to
the
constitution
as
we
know?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
still
on
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
there’s
griswold
against
connecticut
and
there’s
rowe
and
there’s
doe.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
only.
but
you
wouldn’t
say
that
no
corporation
can
own
a
pharmacy?
unknown
speaker
could
north
dakota
pass
a
law
saying
that
a
pharmacy
cannot
be
owned
by
a
corporations?
and
i
am
going
to
combine
that
law
and
medicine,
right
after
you
answer.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
can
the
--
say
a
lawyer
cannot
practice
as
a
corporation?
unknown
speaker
like
a
physician
--
unknown
speaker
well,
under
your
law.
but
under
the
federal
constitution
law
of
the
state,
it
directly
says
that
there’s
no
need
for
evidence
if
is
using
a
gradual
basis.
unknown
speaker
your
client
is
hooked
up
with
a
big
chain?
unknown
speaker
supermarket
chain?
unknown
speaker
mr.
vogel,
perhaps
you’ve
answered
this.
if
so,
i
missed
it
and
of
course,
this
isn’t
your
case.
but
what
would
be
your
position
if
the
pharmacy
boards
regulation
was
nearly
directed
at
physicians
owning
pharmacies?
unknown
speaker
so
that
in
your
state
then,
there
is
no
pharmacy
board
barrier
against
that
kind
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
the
ownership
one.
if
the
board
has
turn
around
and
do
away
with
this
one
but
say
that
physicians
should
not
own
pharmacies,
then
what
would
be
your
attitude?
again,
i
say
this
isn’t
your
case.
i
understand
an
unanswered
question.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
would
be
a
legitimate
statement.
i
like
your
state
very
much,
there
are
many
times.
i
don’t
know
its
problems.
but
i
could
just
see
how
people
live
in
there,
you
don’t
have
many
people,
how
north
dakota
might
become
a
subject
of
exploitations
by
delaware
corporation
around
the
country
using
little
vacuum
cleaner
to
suck
out
from
north
dakota
all
the
money
possible
and
leaving
nothing
behind
by
which
a
tax
base
can
be
laid
and
the
schools
built
and
so
on.
i
can
see
a
state
to
saying
we
are
going
to
stop
that.
i
don’t
see
why
that
would
not
follow
that.
a
good
category
is
health,
certain
welfare,
welfare
in
the
sense
of
welfare
of
the
people,
don’t
you
agree?
unknown
speaker
i
was
not
talking
about
stopping
--
removing
the
good.
i
was
talking
about
requiring
every
druggist
in
the
state.
every
merchant
in
the
state
to
could
be
a
single
entrepreneur.
unknown
speaker
you
got
some
big
revolutions
in
north
dakota.
our
court
sustained
in
1920
here.
unknown
speaker
remember
that?
unknown
speaker
have
you
considered
that
recently?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
that
might
have
solved
turtle
mountain
problem
in
the
last
case.
[laughter]
