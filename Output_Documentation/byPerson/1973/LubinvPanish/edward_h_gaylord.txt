mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
were
certain
preliminary
questions
asked.
as
i
understand
this
election,
this
was
a
true
primary.
in
california,
you
have
a
primary
votes
for
partisan
and
nonpartisan
officers.
as
to
partisan
officers,
only
those
persons
registered
with
the
party
can
vote
in
that
particular
primary.
but,
the
local
officers
and
judicial
officers
are
all
nonpartisan
and
every
qualified
voter
who
is
registered
in
the
district
can
vote
for
one
of
those
offices.
ever
since
1926,
if
a
nonpartisan
office,
a
person
gets
the
majority,
he
is
then
and
they
are
elected
and
then
for
him,
it
becomes
a
general
election.
but
otherwise,
it
remains
a
primary
and
the
one
who
gets
the
most
votes
and
the
one
who
gets
the
second
most
votes,
then
is
the
--
are
the
two
nominated
candidates
who
are
--
then
go
before
the
voters
and
the
general
election
in
november.
and,
if
i
am
correct
that
this
was
the
fourth
district,
that
happened
then,
there
were
two
candidates
that
got
the
most
and
next
to
the
most
voters
neither
one
getting
majority
and
one
of
them
was
elected
in
the
general
election.
the
question
was
asked,
what
is
the
status
of
a
denial
without
opinion
by
the
supreme
court
of
a
writ
of
mandate?
there
are
three
supreme
court
cases
that
definitely
hold
that
the
denial
by
minute
order
of
an
application
for
a
writ
of
mandate
is
simply
a
refusal
by
the
state’s
supreme
court
to
exercise
its
original
jurisdiction
and
is
not
an
adjudication
on
the
merits.
i
merely
bring
that
up
because
the
question
was
asked.
i
am
not
objecting
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
your
honor,
do
you
want
me
to
--
these
citations
or
shall
i
get
them
to
the
clerk
or
--
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
i
will
hand
that
to
the
clerk
then
i
--
wait
for
a
moment.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
i
will
see
that
she
has
a
copy.
there
was
one
case
before
this
court
in
1951
where
there
was
a
denial
by
the
court
of
appeals
without
opinion
and
the
court
of
appeals
certified
that
they
did
deny
it
on
a
federal
ground
and
the
court
said
it
had
jurisdiction,
but
in
this
discretion
nevertheless
dismissed
the
case.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
i
say
i
am
not
objecting
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
when
i
originally
put
back
my
response
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
asked
this
court
to
take
jurisdictions
frankly
i
did
point
have
not
occurred
to
me,
later
i
hardly
saw
that
i
was
in
the
position
to
raise
the
question
and
i
would
not
raised
it
but
i
am
merely
answering
questions
over
the
court.
on
the
write-in
votes,
i
would
like
to
stress
once
more
that
the
requirement
for
a
fee
in
order
to
have
a
write-in
vote
counted
was
not
put
in
until
1968,
therefore
say
in
1967,
there
was
a
reasonable
alternative
to
having
your
name
on
the
ballot.
the
law
was
valid
then
and
under
the
decisions
of
both
this
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
california
which
are
cited
in
our
brief,
if
the
fee
requirement
to
write-in
votes
makes
this
system
unconstitutional,
i
am
not
conceding
but
even
if
it
does,
it
is
the
68th
amendment
which
is
unconstitutional
and
not
the
original
law
which
has
been
in
effect
since
1913.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
no,
it
is
not
that
fee.
the
difficulty
with
the
write-in
law
in
california
in
1968,
they
put
in
a
law
that
both
will
not
be
counted
for
a
write-in
unless
the
candidate
files
a
notice
at
least
five
days
ahead
of
time
that
he
is
a
write-in
candidate
and
pays
a
fee
he
would
have
paid
to
get
his
name
on
the
ballot.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
no,
i
think
the
rule
in
california
is
that
if
you
can
definitely
ascertain
that
the
name
written
in
is
for
this
particular
individual,
the
vote
will
be
counted
for
that
individual.
i
might
concede
that
write-in
may
be
difficult
but
it
has
been
done.
mr.
ellis
patterson
for
example
in
1936
lost
his
bid
to
be
nominated
by
the
republican
party
as
the
member
of
the
assembly
that
is
the
lower
house
of
california.
he
distributed
pencils
having
printed
thereon,
write-in
ellis
e.
patterson.
and,
the
party
had
the
exact
name,
the
exact
spelling
and
he
did
win
the
elections.
i
also
cited
that
it
is
very
unusual
case
where
a
candidate
for
a
judge
was
defeated
in
the
primary
and
under
the
law
at
that
time
prior
to
1926,
the
name
of
the
winner
was
the
only
one
on
the
ballot
and
then
this
defeated
judge
defeated
the
winner
in
the
final
election
by
ranking
so
it
can
be
done.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
it’s
five-member
board.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
all
five
elected
of
those
supervisorial
districts
of
about
1,400,000
people
in
each
district.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
each
on
to
the
separate
districts
and
--
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
that
is
correct
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
so
there
would
be
the
voters
in
a
district
with
a
population
of
1,400,000.
incidentally,
i
take
it
what
mr.
lubin
was
running
for
was
to
be
a
supervisor
with
a
salary
of
over
$35,000.00
a
year
representing
almost
three
times
as
these
many
people
as
a
congressman
represents.
and,
he
offers
that
in
court,
if
he
had
any
substantial
support
or
whatever,
he
is
sure
would
have
no
difficulty
in
getting
the
$701.00
for
a
filing
fee.
as
the
new
mexico
court
said
which
i
quoted
to
the
brief,
that
case
now
is
before
this
court
i
understand.
it
does
not
measure
the
candidate’s
pocket
but
the
amount
of
his
support.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
i
do
not
think
so.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
no,
we
are
not
contending
that
this
fee
is
necessary
to
support
the
election
process.
we
are
contending
that
it
is
a
test
of
good
faith
candidacy.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
i
think
it
does
help.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
it’s
not.
i
concede
it’s
not
perfect.
it
could
be
that
a
very
well
to
do
man
or
a
rich
man
would
run
frivolously
because
$701.00
means
nothing
to
him
but
it’s
less
likely.
it
does
to
keep
out
to
great
many
frivolous
candidates.
incidentally,
a
man
like
that
would
be
less
likely
to
run
just
as
lark
besides
and
that
candidate
who
can
do
that
is
--
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
that
is
true
but
i
would
say
that
a
man
without
the
$700.00,
it
is
not
necessarily
barged
from
putting
his
name
on
the
ballot
if
he
really
has
any
substantial
support.
now,
ms.
buckley
seems
to
illustrate
a
man
--
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
i
agree
with
that.
i
agree
that
this
is
not
a
perfect
method
but
i
think
the
legislatures
thinks
it
is
a
--
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
no.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
yes,
i
do.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
yes,
i
would
think
so.
it
is
a
reasonable
way
and
what
is
the
alternate?
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
yes,
the
only
alternate
as
if
i
see
it
is
to
require
a
large
number
of
names
like
1%
or
2%
which
would
be
enormous
in
the
--
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
yes,
he
does
have
to
collect
the
few
signatures,
35
to
40,
something
like
that.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
well,
the
qualifications
of
a
supervisor
are
merely
that
he
would
be
a
resident
of
the
district.
the
charger
says
for
one
year
before
election
--
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
some
of
the
states
--
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
that
is
the
only
requirement
to
be
(voice
overlap).
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
and
to
go
on
the
ballot,
he
must
put
up.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
that
is
correct.
there
is
--
i
cannot
think
of
any
political
office
like
that,
i
can’t
think
of
any
type
of
civil
service
examination.
i
think
that
man
would
be
practical.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
he
might
be
a
little
more
responsible
but
--
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
that’s
correct.
and
there
is
a
question
of
drawing
lines,
the
man
who
is
--
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
well,
i
mean,
a
man
who
is
18
on
the
day
of
election
can
vote
and
yet
you
cannot
say
that
he
is
much
more
learned
than
the
man
who
is
two
days
younger,
but
you
do
have
to
draw
the
lines
somewhere.
as
this
court
itself
said
in
bullock
versus
carter,
that
fee
was
too
high
but
not
all
fees
are
invalid
and
there
becomes
a
time
when
the
fee
becomes
too
high.
now,
where
you
draw
the
line
is
a
difficult
question.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
well,
i
would
say
this,
whether
there
is
a
specific
appropriation
or
not
if
the
money
spent
on
the
election
is
probably
stable
--
far
greater
than
the
fees
collected.
and,
if
that
is
true,
does
it
make
too
much
difference
that
there
is
a
specific
appropriation
that
this
particular
fund
he
used
for
this
particular
person.
ms.
buckley
mentions
in
our
brief
that
very
few
people
took
advantage
of
give
a
dollar
to
the
party
of
your
choice.
well,
it
is
very
easy
to
see
that
great
many
people
may
not
be
particularly
concerned
with
a
particular
political
party
as
a
whole,
but
maybe
very
much
concerned
with
the
particular
candidate
especially
a
non-partisan
candidate
where
a
person
carrying
nothing
at
all
about
parties
would
be
very
interested.
so
i
do
not
know
think
that
that
is
a
good
illustration.
she
also
raises
in
her
brief
although
she
hadn’t
said
it
early
that
there
is
a
provision
that
you
have
to
get
at
least
1%
of
the
vote
to
get
a
nomination.
that
may
work
some
hardship
in
the
case
of
some
very
small
political
parties
but
in
a
case
of
a
non-partisan,
it
is
almost
inconceivable
that
somebody
would
get
less
1%
of
the
vote
and
yet
be
the
second
person.
although
all
of
those
voted
for,
you
have
to
have
at
least
52
candidates
and
the
very
unusual
situation
to
have
that
so
it
would
be
practically
impossible
for
a
person
to
get
second
in
amount
of
votes
in
a
non-partisan
office
and
not
have
at
least
1%.
and,
even
if
that
should
happen,
it
would
be
practically
impossible
to
the
person
that
got
that
few
votes
in
the
primary
would
then
receive
the
majority
in
the
general
election.
a
great
deal
that
ms.
buckley
has
said
i
think
is
within
her
brief
and
has
been
answered
in
our
brief
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
that
is
all
i
have.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
were
certain
preliminary
questions
asked.
as
i
understand
this
election,
this
was
a
true
primary.
in
california,
you
have
a
primary
votes
for
partisan
and
nonpartisan
officers.
as
to
partisan
officers,
only
those
persons
registered
with
the
party
can
vote
in
that
particular
primary.
but,
the
local
officers
and
judicial
officers
are
all
nonpartisan
and
every
qualified
voter
who
is
registered
in
the
district
can
vote
for
one
of
those
offices.
ever
since
1926,
if
a
nonpartisan
office,
a
person
gets
the
majority,
he
is
then
and
they
are
elected
and
then
for
him,
it
becomes
a
general
election.
but
otherwise,
it
remains
a
primary
and
the
one
who
gets
the
most
votes
and
the
one
who
gets
the
second
most
votes,
then
is
the
--
are
the
two
nominated
candidates
who
are
--
then
go
before
the
voters
and
the
general
election
in
november.
and,
if
i
am
correct
that
this
was
the
fourth
district,
that
happened
then,
there
were
two
candidates
that
got
the
most
and
next
to
the
most
voters
neither
one
getting
majority
and
one
of
them
was
elected
in
the
general
election.
the
question
was
asked,
what
is
the
status
of
a
denial
without
opinion
by
the
supreme
court
of
a
writ
of
mandate?
there
are
three
supreme
court
cases
that
definitely
hold
that
the
denial
by
minute
order
of
an
application
for
a
writ
of
mandate
is
simply
a
refusal
by
the
state’s
supreme
court
to
exercise
its
original
jurisdiction
and
is
not
an
adjudication
on
the
merits.
i
merely
bring
that
up
because
the
question
was
asked.
i
am
not
objecting
to
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
your
honor,
do
you
want
me
to
--
these
citations
or
shall
i
get
them
to
the
clerk
or
--
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
i
will
hand
that
to
the
clerk
then
i
--
wait
for
a
moment.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
i
will
see
that
she
has
a
copy.
there
was
one
case
before
this
court
in
1951
where
there
was
a
denial
by
the
court
of
appeals
without
opinion
and
the
court
of
appeals
certified
that
they
did
deny
it
on
a
federal
ground
and
the
court
said
it
had
jurisdiction,
but
in
this
discretion
nevertheless
dismissed
the
case.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
i
say
i
am
not
objecting
the
jurisdiction
of
this
court.
when
i
originally
put
back
my
response
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
and
asked
this
court
to
take
jurisdictions
frankly
i
did
point
have
not
occurred
to
me,
later
i
hardly
saw
that
i
was
in
the
position
to
raise
the
question
and
i
would
not
raised
it
but
i
am
merely
answering
questions
over
the
court.
on
the
write-in
votes,
i
would
like
to
stress
once
more
that
the
requirement
for
a
fee
in
order
to
have
a
write-in
vote
counted
was
not
put
in
until
1968,
therefore
say
in
1967,
there
was
a
reasonable
alternative
to
having
your

the
law
was
valid
then
and
under
the
decisions
of
both
this
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
california
which
are
cited
in
our
brief,
if
the
fee
requirement
to
write-in
votes
makes
this
system
unconstitutional,
i
am
not
conceding
but
even
if
it
does,
it
is
the
68th
amendment
which
is
unconstitutional
and
not
the
original
law
which
has
been
in
effect
since
1913.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
no,
it
is
not
that
fee.
the
difficulty
with
the
write-in
law
in
california
in
1968,
they
put
in
a
law
that
both
will
not
be
counted
for
a
write-in
unless
the
candidate
files
a
notice
at
least
five
days
ahead
of
time
that
he
is
a
write-in
candidate
and
pays
a
fee
he
would
have
paid
to
get
his
name
on
the
ballot.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
no,
i
think
the
rule
in
california
is
that
if
you
can
definitely
ascertain
that
the
name
written
in
is
for
this
particular
individual,
the
vote
will
be
counted
for
that
individual.
i
might
concede
that
write-in
may
be
difficult
but
it
has
been
done.
mr.
ellis
patterson
for
example
in
1936
lost
his
bid
to
be
nominated
by
the
republican
party
as
the
member
of
the
assembly
that
is
the
lower

he
distributed

write-in
ellis
e.
patterson.
and,
the
party
had
the
exact
name,
the
exact
spelling
and
he
did
win
the
elections.
i
also
cited
that
it
is
very
unusual
case
where
a
candidate
for
a
judge
was
defeated
in
the
primary
and
under
the
law
at
that
time
prior
to
1926,
the
name
of
the
winner
was
the
only
one
on
the
ballot
and
then
this
defeated
judge
defeated
the
winner
in
the
final
election
by
ranking
so
it
can
be
done.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
it’s
five-member
board.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
all
five
elected
of
those
supervisorial
districts
of
about
1,400,000
people
in
each
district.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
each
on
to
the
separate
districts
and
--
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
that
is
correct
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
so
there
would
be
the
voters
in
a
district
with
a
population
of
1,400,000.
incidentally,
i
take
it
what
mr.
lubin
was
running
for
was
to
be
a
supervisor
with
a
salary
of
over
$35,000.00
a
year
representing
almost
three
times
as
these
many
people
as
a
congressman
represents.
and,
he
offers
that
in
court,
if
he
had
any
substantial
support
or
whatever,
he
is
sure
would
have
no
difficulty
in
getting
the
$701.00
for
a
filing
fee.
as
the
new
mexico
court
said
which
i
quoted
to
the
brief,
that
case
now
is
before
this
court
i
understand.
it
does
not
measure
the
candidate’s
pocket
but
the
amount
of
his
support.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
i
do
not
think
so.
i
do
not
know.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
no,
we
are
not
contending
that
this
fee
is
necessary
to
support
the
election
process.
we
are
contending
that
it
is
a
test
of
good
faith
candidacy.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
i
think
it
does
help.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
it’s
not.
i
concede
it’s
not
perfect.
it
could
be
that
a
very
well
to
do
man
or
a
rich
man
would
run
frivolously
because
$701.00
means
nothing
to
him
but
it’s
less
likely.
it
does
to
keep
out
to
great
many
frivolous
candidates.
incidentally,
a
man
like
that
would
be
less
likely
to
run
just
as
lark
besides
and
that
candidate
who
can
do
that
is
--
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
that
is
true
but
i
would
say
that
a
man
without
the
$700.00,
it
is
not
necessarily
barged
from
putting
his
name
on
the
ballot
if
he
really
has
any
substantial
support.
now,
ms.
buckley
seems
to
illustrate
a
man
--
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
i
agree
with
that.
i
agree
that
this
is
not
a
perfect
method
but
i
think
the
legislatures
thinks
it
is
a
--
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
no.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
yes,
i
do.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
yes,
i
would
think
so.
it
is
a
reasonable
way
and
what
is
the
alternate?
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
yes,
the
only
alternate
as
if
i
see
it
is
to
require
a
large
number
of
names
like
1%
or
2%
which
would
be
enormous
in
the
--
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
yes,
he
does
have
to
collect
the
few
signatures,
35
to
40,
something
like
that.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
well,
the
qualifications
of
a
supervisor
are
merely
that
he
would
be
a
resident
of
the
district.
the
charger
says
for
one
year
before
election
--
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
some
of
the
states
--
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
that
is
the
only
requirement
to
be
(voice
overlap).
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
and
to
go
on
the
ballot,
he
must
put
up.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
that
is
correct.
there
is
--
i
cannot
think
of
any
political
office
like
that,
i
can’t
think
of
any
type
of
civil
service
examination.
i
think
that
man
would
be
practical.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
he
might
be
a
little
more
responsible
but
--
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
that’s
correct.
and
there
is
a
question
of
drawing
lines,
the
man
who
is
--
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
well,
i
mean,
a
man
who
is
18
on
the
day
of
election
can
vote
and
yet
you
cannot
say
that
he
is
much
more
learned
than
the
man
who
is
two
days
younger,
but
you
do
have
to
draw
the
lines
somewhere.
as
this
court
itself
said
in
bullock
versus
carter,
that
fee
was
too
high
but
not
all
fees
are
invalid
and
there
becomes
a
time
when
the
fee
becomes
too
high.
now,
where
you
draw
the
line
is
a
difficult
question.
mr.
edward
h.
gaylord
well,
i
would
say
this,
whether
there
is
a
specific
appropriation
or
not
if
the
money
spent
on
the
election
is
probably
stable
--
far
greater
than
the
fees
collected.
and,
if
that
is
true,
does
it
make
too
much
difference
that
there
is
a
specific
appropriation
that
this
particular
fund
he
used
for
this
particular
person.
ms.
buckley
mentions
in
our
brief
that
very
few
people
took
advantage
of
give
a
dollar
to
the
party
of
your
choice.
well,
it
is
very
easy
to
see
that
great
many
people
may
not
be
particularly
concerned
with
a
particular
political
party
as
a
whole,
but
maybe
very
much
concerned
with
the
particular
candidate
especially
a
non-partisan
candidate
where
a
person
carrying
nothing
at
all
about
parties
would
be
very
interested.
so
i
do
not
know
think
that
that
is
a
good
illustration.
she
also
raises
in
her
brief
although
she
hadn’t
said
it
early
that
there
is
a
provision
that
you
have
to
get
at
least
1%
of
the
vote
to
get
a
nomination.
that
may
work
some
hardship
in
the
case
of
some
very
small
political
parties
but
in
a
case
of
a
non-partisan,
it
is
almost
inconceivable
that
somebody
would
get
less
1%
of
the
vote
and
yet
be
the
second
person.
although
all
of
those
voted
for,
you
have
to
have
at
least
52
candidates
and
the
very
unusual
situation
to
have
that
so
it
would
be
practically
impossible
for
a
person
to
get
second
in
amount
of
votes
in
a
non-partisan
office
and
not
have
at
least
1%.
and,
even
if
that
should
happen,
it
would
be
practically
impossible
to
the
person
that
got
that
few
votes
in
the
primary
would
then
receive
the
majority
in
the
general
election.
a
great
deal
that
ms.
buckley
has
said
i
think
is
within
her
brief
and
has
been
answered
in
our
brief
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
that
is
all
i
have.
