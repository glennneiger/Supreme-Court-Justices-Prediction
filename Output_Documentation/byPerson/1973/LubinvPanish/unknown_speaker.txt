mr.
gaylord,
in
the
68th

there
is
a
provision
reciting
the
intention
of
the
legislature
that
the
filing
fee
shall
be
used
to
support
the
state
commission
on

has
there
ever
any
appropriations
that
made
presumed
for
that
declaration
of
intent?
unknown

we
don’t
have
any
legal
significance
in
this
case?
unknown

what
about
the
first
to
who
has
$701.00
or
$7,000.00,
there
is
much
money,
does
anybody
wanted
to
try
that?
you
think
judge

the
$701.00
that

i
ask
that

conceive
that
with
$701.00
putting
himself
on

one?
unknown

if
we
go
back
to
my
inquiry
about
the
access
so
that
means
the
legislate
of
the
corporation
of
these
fees.
how
do
you
answer
the
suggestion
that
these

are
nothing
more
than
a
revenue
raising
device?
unknown

well,
i
understood
your
tradition,
that
you
cannot
put
a
price
tag,
any
candidacy
