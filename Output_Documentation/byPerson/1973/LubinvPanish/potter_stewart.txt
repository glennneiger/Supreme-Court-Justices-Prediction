yes,
is
there

under

do
not

do
you
need
to

the
proposition
that
there
is
an
explicit

to
use
your
word
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
constitutional
right
to
be
a
candidate
for

precisely,
whether
or

their
right
to

is
that
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
and
at

part
of
it?
justice

stewart
your
brief
proceeds
upon
the
premise
that
the
court
decided
the
constitutional
merit
to
this
case.
justice

suppose
the

board
present?
justice

all

each
on

they
do

though
i
had

$500.00

justice

in

was
the

a
pauper?
justice

will
ask
somebody
about
that
case.

that
case
was
designed
as
a
matter
of

law
was
it

there
is
i
thought
that
your
case
dependent
upon
the
fact
that
your

was
a
pauper.
