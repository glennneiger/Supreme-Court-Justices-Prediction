we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
number
71-6852,
lubin
against
panish.
ms.
buckley,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
mentioned
the
fact
that
a
very
large
percentage
of
the
voters
do
not
vote
in
this
country.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
familiar
with
some
of
the
studies,
which
have
to
come
to
the
conclusion
for
whatever
the
conclusion
maybe
would,
but
one
of
the
reasons
is
for
the
lower
board
of
chain
out,
of
the
reasons
is
it
is
excessively
large
number
of
people
on
the
ballots,
the
long
and
confusing
ballots
they
must
deal
with
either
on
the
voting
machine
or
on
a
paper
ballot.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
your
approach
tend
to
increase
the
number
of
candidates
running
for
the
public
office?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
because
there
is
another
good
way
or
perhaps
even
another
better
way,
does
that
looked
to
a
constitutional
issue?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gaylord.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
hand
that
to
the
clerk
if
you
wish.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
i
take
it,
ms.
buckley
has
copies
of
her
own
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
gaylord.
ms.
buckley,
you
have
about
six
minutes
left
if
you
want
to
use
them.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
impression
from
your
earlier
argument
ms.
buckley
that
if
a
fee
with
$100.00,
you
would
still
be
here,
is
that
right
or
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
$10.00?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
really
object
to
any
fee,
don’t
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
think
the
state
has
no
interest
in
preventing
if
they
can
having
250
people
running
for
this
particular
office?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
conceived
they
have
an
interest
in
doing
it
in
some
way.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
by
the
petitioning
process.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
think
your
time
is
consumed
now
ms.
buckley.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
gaylord.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
have
the
opinion
to
announce
in
number
71-6852.
lubin
against
panish,
the
registrar
of
los
angles
county.
the
petitioner,
an
indigent
wanted
to
file
for
election
as
county
supervisor
and
the
filing
fee
was
$400.
he
filed
an
affidavit
of
indigency
that
he
had
no
income
and
no
assets.
we
hold
that
absent
some
reasonable
alternative
means
of
getting
on
the
ballot,
a
state
may
not,
consistent
with
constitutional
standards,
require
from
an
indigent
candidate
filing
fees
as
a
condition
to
being
put
on
the
ballot.
the
judgment
under
review
is,
therefore,
reversed
and
the
case
us
remanded
for
further
proceedings,
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion
of
the
court.
we
will
resume
arguments
in
central

oh,
excuse
me.
