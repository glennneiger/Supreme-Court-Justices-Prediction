ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
the
counsel
for
donald
lubin,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
spoke
individually
and
on
behalf
of
the
members
of
his
class.
this
case
first
begin
a
year
ago
in
february,
at
which
time
approximately
22
people
who
were
desirers
of
becoming
candidate
and
the
forthcoming
elections
came
to
me
and
we
all
proceeded
to
the
office
of
the
registrar,
the
recorder
registrar
in
the
county
of
los
angeles.
included
among
these
22
people
were
men
and
women,
black
and
white,
most
strictly
some
freedom
party
members
but
also
two
members
of
the
democratic
party,
a
member
of
the
republican
party
and
a
member
of
the
american-independent
party.
they
had
two
things
in
common,
they
wanted
to
be
candidates
because
they
had
something
to
say
to
the
electors
and
they
could
not
afford
to
pay
the
filing
fees.
now,
there
was
one
other
distinction
also
and
that
was
that
most
of
the
people
who
wanted
to
become
candidates,
who
are
running
for
a
primary
position
at
political
office
which
required
them
to
be
a
member
of
the
party.
but
in
county
and
city
elections
in
california,
most
of
the
offices
are
nonpartisan
and
therefore,
donald
lubin
who
wished
to
run
for
the
office
of
board
of
supervisor
was
running
in
a
general
election,
not
a
primary
election.
he
was
not
a
member
of
a
party
for
purposes
of
ballot
status.
we
filed
a
writ
of
mandamus
asking
the
--
both
the
recorder
registrar
of
the
county
of
los
angeles
and
the
secretary
of
state
of
california
to
issue
nomination
papers
to
these
people
without
the
necessity
of
paying
fees.
we
were
granted
a
temporary
injunction
by
judge
cole
of
the
los
angeles
superior
court
and
an
ultimate
writ
was
set
for
hearing
on
march
6.
at
that
time,
judge
rehnquist
sitting
in
the
los
angeles
county
superior
court
held
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
bullock
applying
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
california
fees
were
reasonable
and
the
fact
that
there
was
no
alternative
did
not
matter
under
bullock.
thereafter,
i
filed
another
writ
of
mandate
in
the
appellate
court
in
california,
procedure
which
is
an
alternate
to
an
appeal.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
but
it
would
have
been
meaningless
in
terms
of
relief
for
our
clients
because
we
could
never
have
gotten
any
kind
of
hearing
before
the
elections
would
be
held.
the
only
reasonable
choice
we
had
was
filled
by
way
of
writ
of
mandate
to
the
appellate
court.
to
give
them
the
best
opportunity
to
rule
reasonably,
we
attached
a
copy
of
the
transcript
to
the
hearing
in
the
lower
court.
we
were
denied
with
that
hearing
and
we
promptly
filed
a
writ
of
mandate
in
the
supreme
court.
and
again,
the
transcript
of
the
hearings
including
judge
weinkie's
statement
at
page
three,
to
the
effect
that
it
appears
to
the
court
that
the
fees
are
reasonable
as
a
matter
of
law
was
before
the
supreme
court
and
they
denied
the
mandate
without
a
hearing.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
in
as
much
as
they
had
the
complete
proceedings
of
the
lower
court,
i
know
of
no
case
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
but
if
it
presented
to
the
court,
all
of
the
material,
which
was
before
the
lower
court
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
i
have
no
knowledge
of
that
your
honor.
and
so,
we
are
now
here
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
particular
route
that
we
took
is
recognized
in
california
law.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
justice
blackmun,
it
has
not
been
changed
and
even
if
it
were,
i
submit
to
this
court
that
write-ins
are
not
a
suitable
alternative.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
that
is
correct.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
that
is
correct.
and,
at
a
later
point,
i
will
discuss
the
differences
between
the
write-in
and
the
position
on
the
ballot,
because
it
makes
a
difference
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
no,
your
honor.
since
you
have
raised
the
question
now,
i’ll
answer
it
now.
in
a
write-in
situation
and
in
the
first
place,
donald
lubin
had
a
territory
that
covered
600,000
people.
as
a
write-in
candidate,
he
would
be
required
to
make
his
name
known
to
those
people
not
only
well
enough
so
that
they
recognize
it
on
the
ballot,
but
so
that
they
could
remember
it
to
write
it
down.
now,
i
cited
in
my
reply
brief
an
instance
in
california
where
we
had
a
case
of
fraud.
a
man
by
the
name
of
vicenzia
was
placed
on
the
ballot
to
take
votes
away
from
a
man
by
the
name
of
valencia
and
the
circumstances
around
that
particular
filing
made
it
obvious
that
there
was
only
one
reason
for
that
filing
to
be
done
and
that
was
that
the
voters
could
even
make
a
mistake
between
vicenzia
and
valencia
and
not
be
able
to
vote
for
the
man
that
they
wanted
to.
how
much
more
difficult
would
it
be
for
them
to
remember
the
man’s
name
to
write
it
down
as
the
write-in
candidate.
secondly,
as
a
candidate
on
the
ballot,
you
were
entitled
to
all
sorts
of
things.
number
one,
you
are
entitled
the
equal
time
on
radio
and
tv.
number
two,
every
major
newspaper
has
a
practice,
in
los
angeles
county
for
instance,
of
writing
articles
on
the
ballot
candidates
at
least
once
and
possibly
twice
during
the
campaign.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
until
he
has
in
some
way
established
himself
as
a
write-in
candidate,
he
is
just
running
around
and
telling
the
people,
vote
for
me.
but,
until
he
complies
with
the
provisions
of
the
code
including
paying
the
fee,
he
is
not
entitled
even
to
have
his
vote
camp.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
i
am
relying
on
the
fact
that
as
a
candidate,
i
am
aware
of
how
difficult
it
was
for
even
established
candidate
to
get
equal
time
from
the
stations.
as
a
practical
matter,
not
all
candidates,
particularly
poll
candidates
who
would
be
the
only
people
who
are
write
in
--
who
were
being
write-in
candidates
would
have
even
less
resources
at
that
command
to
force,
the
stations
spend
to
give
them
equal
time
and
that
brings
up
another
point.
if
what
you
offer
as
an
alternative
is
write-in
campaign,
you
are
placing
a
much
greater
burden
on
those
people
who
cannot
afford
even
in
many
cases
the
beginning
of
filing
fee
and
what
you
are
requiring
them
to
do
is
additional
kinds
of
work
that
will
require
more
resources
than
the
normal
candidate.
you
are
putting
them
in
an
unfair
position
and
the
different
kind
of
position
than
those
people
who
can
afford
to
pay
the
fee.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
that’s
not
true
your
honor
and
i
cited
an
example
from
our
last
election
where
a
democratic
candidate
who
--
because
of
the
storer
versus
brown
and
the
filing
of
this
suit
was
able
to
get
a
place
on
the
ballot.
and
as
a
result,
he
spent
--
he
would
have
spent
$450.00
in
order
to
be
a
candidate
for
congress.
he
did
not
have
that
kind
of
money.
he
spent
$138.00
of
his
own
money
and
$40.00
from
supporters
and
he
gained
33%
of
the
vote
or
17,000
voter.
now,
the
alternative
here
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
but,
your
honor,
in
our
state,
he
would
have
had
to
pay
for
the
privilege
agreement
candidate.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
one
of
the
important
things
of
allowing
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
justice
marshall?
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
no,
you
are
not
and
may
i
say
with
all
due
respect,
because
what
will
happen
is
the
same
thing
that
happened
to
our
democratic
candidate
who
went
around
and
knocked
on
doors,
and
thereby
brought
more
meaning
from
this.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
he
got
16,000
votes.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
now,
with
that
your
honor,
but
we
presently
have
a
potential
candidate
for
democratic
governor
who
fortunately
does
not
have
to
file
the
form
of
corpus
but
he
doesn’t
have
very
much
money
and
he
is
walking
the
entire
state
of
california
thereby
getting
free
publicity
both
from
tv
and
radio
and
newspapers.
so
it
is
possible
and
it
is
not
necessarily
going
to
be
the
result
that
somebody
who
is
able
to
avoid
paying
a
very
large
fee
of
$850.00
or
$1,000.00
is
going
to
win
the
election.
but
the
important
thing
is
that
person
is
not
be
barred
from
the
political
process
and
i
think
this
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
have
been
getting
questions
about
the
practical
result
and
i
agree
that
the
practical
results
are
not
an
issue
here.
what
is
an
issue
is
whether
we
can
deny
people
who
cannot
afford
to
pay
for
the
privilege
of
running
and
opportunity
to
participate
meaningfully
in
the
political
process.
and
i
think
that
when
we
look
at
the
facts
that
the
united
states
which
is
one
of
the
greatest
democracies
has
a
lower
voting
turnout
than
many
of
the
other
democracies
according
to
the
new
york
times,
then
we
have
to
begin
to
ask
why.
and
part
of
why
is
because
in
this
country,
approximately
25%
of
the
people
are
on
a
poverty
standard
of
living.
according
to
the
united
states,
director
of
a
poverty
neighborhood
legal
services
and
i
remember
our
guidelines
very
well,
$3,500.00
for
a
family
of
four
and
yet
the
bureau
of
labor
standards
says
that
you
need
$7,000.00
for
a
family
of
four.
well,
if
you
do
not
have
enough
money
to
feed
your
family,
how
are
you
going
to
be
able
to
take
part
in
the
political
process
and
if
it
need
addition,
people
who
want
to
represent
you
and
who
come
from
your
own
class
and
do
not
have
money
either
can’t
even
get
on
the
ballot,
then
you
do
not
want
to
vote.
now,
i
think
so
that
this
court
has
made
it
quite
clear
that
the
rights
of
voters
are
intertwined
with
the
rights
of
candidates
but
i
think
that
it
is
time
for
the
court
to
make
the
decision
that
there
is
a
right
to
be
a
candidate,
to
take
a
forthright
position
and
say
that
you
cannot
have
elections
without
candidates.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor,
i
understand
and
that
is
very
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
your
honor,
i
believe
that
there
is
an
alternative
and
did
not
--
in
my
brief,
we
have
discussed
the
fact
that
you
do
need
to,
--
in
some
ways
make
sure
that
your
ballot
contains
a
reasonable
number
of
people
and
people
who
are
reasonably
serious
but
that
can
be
taken
care
of
by
the
requirement
of
petitions
and
signatures.
new
york
which
is
a
rival
to
california
in
every
way
handles
this
matter
very
well
with
petitions
and
they
don’t
worry
about
an
unwieldy
ballot
because
the
very
active
requiring
signatures
also
means
that
the
candidate
has
to
get
out
in
advance
and
make
himself
or
herself
known
to
the
people
and
the
community.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
but
your
honor,
we
are
dealing
with
the
very
basis
of
our
society.
we
are
dealing
with
the
political
system.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
not
only
to
articles
one
and
two
require
elected
legislature
and
executives,
but
that
article
4
section
4
provides
that
the
united
states
shall
guarantee
to
every
state
a
republican
form
of
government
and
the
republican
form
of
government
means
citizens
who
are
entitled
to
vote.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
court
has
already.
in
fact,
in
san
antonio
v.
rodriguez
in
which
they
were
dealing
with
an
educational
problem
but
you
took
many
takers
of
decision
to
deal
with
the
fact
that
the
electoral
process
is
one
of
the
most
important
processes
to
our
form
or
government.
and,
i
only
mentioned
the
constitution
as
a
basis
and
i
am
not
unaware
of
the
fact
that
this
court
has
time
after
time
after
time
stress
the
importance
of
voting
that
it
is
in
fact
one
of
the
explicit
rights
guaranteed
in
the
constitution
and
therefore
has
to
be
protected
in
the
highest
way.
i
am
merely
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
your
honor
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
in
rodriguez,
you
made
the
distinction
between
implicit
and
explicit
and
you
said
that
an
item
such
as
education
and
very
many
other
important
kinds
of
rights,
maybe
very
important
but
were
not
protected
by
the
constitution
because
they
are
not
explicit.
and
then,
you
went
in
and
i
assumed
that
you
were
--
i
may
have
misread
your
opinion
although
i
did
read
it
several
times.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
you
then
went
into
the
importance
of
the
electoral
process
to
our
system.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
and,
not
only
that,
but
you
did
what
i
thought
was,
from
my
purposes
and
my
proprieties
for
this,
your
honor,
you
did
layout
very
carefully
the
line
of
cases
in
which
you
dealt
with
the
importance
of
this
right.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
and
my
only
--
i
am
attempting
here
to
point
out
that
the
right
to
be
a
candidate
may
one
day
in
the
future,
in
the
year
2000,
if
we
use
our
bookman’s
to
folders
notion
of
having
all
of
the
people
come
in
and
vote
via
two-way
television,
we
may
be
able
to
do
a
way
with
the
necessity
of
the
candidates
and
representatives,
but
right
now
that
is
our
system.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
right.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
it
was.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
no.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
no,
your
honor.
he
is
a
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
that
is
true,
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
no.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
no,
your
honor,
but
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
but
in
turner
versus
fouche
your
honor,
i
think
the
court
pointed
out
very
well
that
once
you
open
a
position
to
some
people,
then
you
cannot
discriminate
based
on
those
kinds
of
factors
which
are
protected
by
the
fourteenth
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
that
is
my
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
the
reason
i
suggested
the
second
part,
the
question
had
to
do
with
the
question
which
the
members
of
this
court
presented
to
me
that
is
whether
it
made
a
difference
whether
it
was
the
individuals
poverty
or
that
of
his
group.
and,
i
took
that
question
to
me
and
i
should
address
myself
to
the
rights
of
the
candidates
versus
the
rights
of
the
supporters
or
the
voters.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
your
honor,
if
you’re
talking
about
a
primary
election,
i
would
think
that
it
would
not
be
a
percentage
of
the
total
who
voted,
but
the
total
who
voted
in
that
particular
party
because
in
california,
we
have
four
parties,
two
of
which
are
minor
parties.
to
demand
that
they
have
the
same
percentage
of
the
vote
as
those
who
belong
to
the
majority
party
would
work
a
great
hardship.
they
might
not
even
have
that
many
people
in
their
party.
for
instance,
if
you
ask
for
2%
of
the
population,
the
american
independent
may
not
even
have
that
many
people
in
that
party
right
now
and
would
require
100%
of
their
membership.
so,
i
think
that
you
have
to
schedule
it
and
i
think
it
should
be
a
minimum
amount,
something
say
between
a
thousand
and
5000
signatures
in
a
fairly
large
district
and
something
scaled
down
in
a
smaller
district.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
that
would
be
a
statewide
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
i
believe
that
there
were,
for
instance,
the
piece
in
freedom
party,
they
have
30,000
members
registered
and
los
angeles
county
of
course
covers
400
miles.
i
covered
them
all
so
i
am
aware
of
them.
i
think
that
in
that
case,
you
might
want
1%
of
30,000
where
i
get
3.000
signatures.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
poor
people
have
learned
to
walk
and
i
think
that
they
learned
to
get
out
and
knock
on
doors.
they
may
not
be
able
to
contribute
money
and
i
have
documented
fairly
well
the
fact
that
although
we
now
have
the
opportunity
to
mark
off
on
our
income
tax
forms,
the
right
to
give
a
dollar
to
the
party
of
our
choice
if
we
belong
to
a
major
party.
only
3%
of
the
people
nationwide
bothered
to
check
off
to
give
money
to
their
major
parties,
so
for
people
who
may
not
even
be
able
to
file
the
income
tax
returns,
they
cannot
give
money.
but,
they
will
be
go
out
and
knock
on
doors,
they
will
go
out
and
collect
signatures.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
we
require
in
california
that
the
person
who
is
collecting
the
signature
gets
certified
that
he
has
in
fact
obtained
those
signatures
from
the
people
that
he
says
they
were.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
on
some,
your
honor,
they
do,
but
california
provides
for
certification
rather
than
necessity
of
having
a
notary
public.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
except
that
there
is
also
a
provision
in
the
california
law
that
says
that
notaries
may
not
charge
fees
for
political
type
of
documents.
but
again
--
so
that
would
be.
i
will
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
in
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
had
considered
the
matter
prior
to
denying
it,
i
would
like
to
draw
to
your
attention
the
fact
that
in
my
experience,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
generally
when
presented
with
the
writ
of
mandate
for
the
first
time
which
it
does
not
believe
it
has
sufficient
information
to
deal
with
kicks
it
back
to
the
appellate
court
for
decision.
and,
that
same
thing
happened
in
the
case
of
zapata
versus
davidson
to
24
california
appellate
decisions
third
823.
on
this
very
question
of
the
filing
fees
in
the
elections
that
we
were
talking
about,
that
case
were
sent
to
the
appellate
court
in
april,
one
month
after
the
supreme
court
had
denied
us
summarily.
and,
when
presented
with
a
writ
of
mandate
on
the
exact
same
question,
they
sent
it
to
zapata
versus
davidson.
and
the
appellate
court
determined
that
the
filing
fees
were
in
fact
unconstitutional
based
on
the
bullock.
so
i
would
like
at
this
time
to
draw
your
attention
to
a
case
which
has
not
been
cited
in
my
brief
and
that
is
a
zapata
versus
davidson,
24
c
a
third
283
and
that
is
a
1972
decision.
now
secondly,
i
would
like
to
discuss
very
briefly
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
california
fees.
when
counsel
leads
you
to
believe
that
texas
was
so
different
in
california,
i
believe
he
misstates
the
question
because
the
texas
fees
in
some
case
on
state
levels
were
less
than
those
charged
in
california.
as
i
read
the
texas
statute,
the
real
high
fees,
the
$6,000.00
and
$8,000.00
were
primarily
on
county
levels,
but
that
the
state
positions
ran
from
$150.00
to
$850.00
or
$1,000.00
and
that
is
exactly
where
california
is
at.
furthermore,
the
case
of
socialist
party
versus
all
was
cited
as
having
legitimized
california
filing
fees
but
that
is
a
1909
case.
and,
at
that
time,
california
had
filing
fees
ranging
from
$10.00
to
$50.00.
it
had
no
relationship
to
the
emoluments
of
office
and
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
that
is
true,
your
honor.
but
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
no,
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
but
the
question
that
was
raised
was
not
a
us
constitutional
question,
that
was
a
california
constitutional
question.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
but,
in
that
case,
the
dicta
was
to
the
effect
that
while
these
fees
were
reasonable
ranging
from
$10.00
to
$50.00,
that
if
the
fee
structure
had
been
based
on
the
emoluments
of
office
as
the
present
system
is
that
they
would
have
struck
it
down
because
such
a
fee
would
have
no
relationship
to
what
it
cost
to
run
on
election.
it
would
have
no
relationship
to
what
it
cost
to
file
the
papers.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
it
was,
in
1909
and
it
is
the
case
which
my
opponent
relies
upon
and
which
i
believe
judge
rehnquist
relied
upon
in
saying
that
california
fees
were
reasonable.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
your
honor,
i
really
object
to
the
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
if
it
cost
$10.00
to
print
up
the
forms
for
nominating
fees,
then
i
think
perhaps
that
could
be
reasonably
explained.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
you
are
right,
you
are
right,
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
it
does,
he
is
a
pauper.
he
cannot
afford
to
pay
the
fees.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
what
i
was
suggesting,
your
honor,
was
that
--
the
case
has
two
basis
really
and
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court
that
we
are
going
to
go
beyond
just
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
beyond
the
idea
that
paupers
should
have
the
fees
removed
but
we
should
be
looking
to
the
fact
that
all
people
have
a
right
to
participate
in
the
political
process.
because
my
client,
mr.
lubin
is
a
pauper,
but
he
is
also
something
else,
he
has
in
common
with
me
and
with
all
of
you
that
he
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
as
such
has
the
right
to
participate.
and,
i
think
that
placing
any
kind
of
a
fee
which
has
no
relationship
to
the
actual
cost
of
filing
the
papers
is
interfering
with
the
rights
of
all
citizens.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
not
by
using
fees,
your
honor.
not
by
using
a
monetary
standards.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
and
i
suggest
that
there
is
an
alternative.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
no,
i
am
suggesting
to
this
court
that
i
am
giving
you
the
opportunity
if
you
wish
to
take
it
to
broaden
the
scope
of
what
we
have
done
here
forward.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
when
we
are
talking
about
the
right
of
people
to
participate
in
the
political
system,
we
are
talking
about
the
--
i
cannot
give
you
the
exact
part
of
the
constitution
but
it
seems
to
me
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
what
i
am
suggesting,
your
honor,
is
that
the
constitution
as
a
whole
protects
the
political
process.
it
was
designed
to
assure
that
we
would
continue
to
have
a
republican
form
of
government
that
all
of
the
people
would
be
able
to
participate
by
voting.
now,
the
very
provisions
that
you
use
to
sustain
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
you
are
right,
your
honor,
but
we
may
have
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
at
that
point,
the
problem
with
our
system
was
that
it
did
not
recognized
those
people
as
people
and
that
is
to
the
shame
of
our
country.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
i
believe
that
for
instance,
well,
we
have
already
given
everybody
the
right
to
vote
via
the
decisions,
which
this
court
has
made,
but
it
did
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
i
am
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
i
am
remembering
several
cases
if
i
may
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor,
i
understand
that
involves
too.
well,
in
oregon
versus
mitchell,
your
brothers
harlan
and
brennan
both
discussed
the
fact
that
under
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
both
brennan
and
harlan
in
oregon
versus
mitchell
said
that
the
right
to
be
a
candidate
was
inherent
in
the
right
to
vote
and
that
it
was
left
out
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
because
they
assumed
it
was
already
there.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
thank
you,
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
the
counsel
for
donald
lubin,
the
petitioner
in
this
case
spoke
individually
and
on
behalf
of
the
members
of
his
class.
this
case
first
begin
a
year
ago
in
february,
at
which
time
approximately
22
people
who
were
desirers
of
becoming
candidate
and
the
forthcoming
elections
came
to
me
and
we
all
proceeded
to
the
office
of
the
registrar,
the
recorder
registrar
in
the
county
of
los
angeles.
included
among
these
22
people
were
men
and
women,
black
and
white,
most
strictly
some
freedom
party
members
but
also
two
members
of
the
democratic
party,
a
member
of
the
republican
party
and
a
member
of
the
american-independent
party.
they
had
two
things
in
common,
they
wanted
to
be
candidates
because
they
had
something
to
say
to
the
electors
and
they
could
not
afford
to
pay
the
filing
fees.
now,
there
was
one
other
distinction
also
and
that
was
that
most
of
the
people
who
wanted
to
become
candidates,
who
are
running
for
a
primary
position
at
political
office
which
required
them
to
be
a
member
of
the
party.
but
in
county
and
city
elections
in
california,
most
of
the
offices
are
nonpartisan
and
therefore,
donald
lubin
who
wished
to
run
for
the
office
of
board
of
supervisor
was
running
in
a
general
election,
not
a
primary
election.
he
was
not
a
member
of
a
party
for
purposes
of
ballot
status.
we
filed
a
writ
of
mandamus
asking
the
--
both
the
recorder
registrar
of
the
county
of
los
angeles
and
the
secretary
of
state
of
california
to
issue
nomination
papers
to
these
people
without
the
necessity
of
paying
fees.
we
were
granted
a
temporary
injunction
by
judge
cole
of
the
los
angeles
superior
court
and
an
ultimate
writ
was
set
for
hearing
on
march
6.
at
that
time,
judge
rehnquist
sitting
in
the
los
angeles
county
superior
court
held
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
bullock
applying
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
california
fees
were
reasonable
and
the
fact
that
there
was
no
alternative
did
not
matter
under
bullock.
thereafter,
i
filed
another
writ
of
mandate
in
the
appellate
court
in
california,
procedure
which
is
an
alternate
to
an
appeal.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
but
it
would
have
been
meaningless
in
terms
of
relief
for
our
clients
because
we
could
never
have
gotten
any
kind
of
hearing
before
the
elections
would
be
held.
the
only
reasonable
choice
we
had
was
filled
by
way
of
writ
of
mandate
to
the
appellate
court.
to
give
them
the
best
opportunity
to
rule
reasonably,
we
attached
a
copy
of
the
transcript
to
the
hearing
in
the
lower
court.
we
were
denied
with
that
hearing
and
we
promptly
filed
a
writ
of
mandate
in
the
supreme
court.
and
again,
the
transcript
of
the
hearings
including
judge
weinkie's
statement
at
page
three,
to
the
effect
that
it
appears
to
the
court
that
the
fees
are
reasonable
as
a
matter
of
law
was
before
the
supreme
court
and
they
denied
the
mandate
without
a
hearing.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
in
as
much
as
they
had
the
complete
proceedings
of
the
lower
court,
i
know
of
no
case
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
but
if
it
presented
to
the
court,
all
of
the
material,
which
was
before
the
lower
court
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
i
have
no
knowledge
of
that
your
honor.
and
so,
we
are
now
here
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
particular
route
that
we
took
is
recognized
in
california
law.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
justice
blackmun,
it
has
not
been
changed
and
even
if
it
were,
i
submit
to
this
court
that
write-ins
are
not
a
suitable
alternative.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
that
is
correct.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
that
is
correct.
and,
at
a
later
point,
i
will
discuss
the
differences
between
the
write-in
and
the
position
on
the
ballot,
because
it
makes
a
difference
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
no,
your
honor.
since
you
have
raised
the
question
now,
i’ll
answer
it
now.
in
a
write-in
situation
and
in
the
first
place,
donald
lubin
had
a
territory
that
covered
600,000
people.
as
a
write-in
candidate,
he
would
be
required
to
make
his
name
known
to
those
people
not
only
well
enough
so
that
they
recognize
it
on
the
ballot,
but
so
that
they
could
remember
it
to
write
it
down.
now,
i
cited
in
my
reply
brief
an
instance
in
california
where
we
had
a
case
of
fraud.
a
man
by
the
name
of
vicenzia
was
placed
on
the
ballot
to
take
votes
away
from
a
man
by
the
name
of
valencia
and
the
circumstances
around
that
particular
filing
made
it
obvious
that
there
was
only
one
reason
for
that
filing
to
be
done
and
that
was
that
the
voters
could
even
make
a
mistake
between
vicenzia
and
valencia
and
not
be
able
to
vote
for
the
man
that
they
wanted
to.
how
much
more
difficult
would
it
be
for
them
to
remember
the
man’s
name
to
write
it
down
as
the
write-in
candidate.
secondly,
as
a
candidate
on
the
ballot,
you
were
entitled
to
all
sorts
of
things.
number
one,
you
are
entitled
the
equal
time
on
radio
and
tv.
number
two,
every
major
newspaper
has
a
practice,
in
los
angeles
county
for
instance,
of
writing
articles
on
the
ballot
candidates
at
least
once
and
possibly
twice
during
the
campaign.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
until
he
has
in
some
way
established
himself
as
a
write-in
candidate,
he
is
just
running
around
and
telling
the
people,
vote
for
me.
but,
until
he
complies
with
the
provisions
of
the
code
including
paying
the
fee,
he
is
not
entitled
even
to
have
his
vote
camp.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
i
am
relying
on
the
fact
that
as
a
candidate,
i
am
aware
of
how
difficult
it
was
for
even
established
candidate
to
get
equal
time
from
the
stations.
as
a
practical
matter,
not
all
candidates,
particularly
poll
candidates
who
would
be
the
only
people
who
are
write
in
--
who
were
being
write-in
candidates
would
have
even
less
resources
at
that
command
to
force,
the
stations
spend
to
give
them
equal
time
and
that
brings
up
another
point.
if
what
you
offer
as
an
alternative
is
write-in
campaign,
you
are
placing
a
much
greater
burden
on
those
people
who
cannot
afford
even
in
many
cases
the
beginning
of
filing
fee
and
what
you
are
requiring
them
to
do
is
additional
kinds
of
work
that
will
require
more
resources
than
the
normal
candidate.
you
are
putting
them
in
an
unfair
position
and
the
different
kind
of
position
than
those
people
who
can
afford
to
pay
the
fee.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
that’s
not
true
your
honor
and
i
cited
an
example
from
our
last
election
where
a
democratic
candidate
who
--
because
of
the
storer
versus
brown
and
the
filing
of
this
suit
was
able
to
get
a
place
on
the
ballot.
and
as
a
result,
he
spent
--
he
would
have
spent
$450.00
in
order
to
be
a
candidate
for
congress.
he
did
not
have
that
kind
of
money.
he
spent
$138.00
of
his
own
money
and
$40.00
from
supporters
and
he
gained
33%
of
the
vote
or
17,000
voter.
now,
the
alternative
here
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
but,
your
honor,
in
our
state,
he
would
have
had
to
pay
for
the
privilege
agreement
candidate.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
one
of
the
important
things
of
allowing
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
justice
marshall?
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
no,
you
are
not
and
may
i
say
with
all
due
respect,
because
what
will
happen
is
the
same
thing
that
happened
to
our
democratic
candidate
who
went
around
and
knocked
on
doors,
and
thereby
brought
more
meaning
from
this.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
he
got
16,000
votes.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
now,
with
that
your
honor,
but
we
presently
have
a
potential
candidate
for
democratic
governor
who
fortunately
does
not
have
to
file
the
form
of
corpus
but
he
doesn’t
have
very
much
money
and
he
is
walking
the
entire
state
of
california
thereby
getting
free
publicity
both
from
tv
and
radio
and
newspapers.
so
it
is
possible
and
it
is
not
necessarily
going
to
be
the
result
that
somebody
who
is
able
to
avoid
paying
a
very
large
fee
of
$850.00
or
$1,000.00
is
going
to
win
the
election.
but
the
important
thing
is
that
person
is
not
be
barred
from
the
political
process
and
i
think
this
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
have
been
getting
questions
about
the
practical
result
and
i
agree
that
the
practical
results
are
not
an
issue
here.
what
is
an
issue
is
whether
we
can
deny
people
who
cannot
afford
to
pay
for
the
privilege
of
running
and
opportunity
to
participate
meaningfully
in
the
political
process.
and
i
think
that
when
we
look
at
the
facts
that
the
united
states
which
is
one
of
the
greatest
democracies
has
a
lower
voting
turnout
than
many
of
the
other
democracies
according
to
the
new
york
times,
then
we
have
to
begin
to
ask
why.
and
part
of
why
is
because
in
this
country,
approximately
25%
of
the
people
are
on
a
poverty
standard
of
living.
according
to
the
united
states,
director
of
a
poverty
neighborhood
legal
services
and
i
remember
our
guidelines
very
well,
$3,500.00
for
a
family
of
four
and
yet
the
bureau
of
labor
standards
says
that
you
need
$7,000.00
for
a
family
of
four.
well,
if
you
do
not
have
enough
money
to
feed
your
family,
how
are
you
going
to
be
able
to
take
part
in
the
political
process
and
if
it
need
addition,
people
who
want
to
represent
you
and
who
come
from
your
own
class
and
do
not
have
money
either
can’t
even
get
on
the
ballot,
then
you
do
not
want
to
vote.
now,
i
think
so
that
this
court
has
made
it
quite
clear
that
the
rights
of
voters
are
intertwined
with
the
rights
of
candidates
but
i
think
that
it
is
time
for
the
court
to
make
the
decision
that
there
is
a
right
to
be
a
candidate,
to
take
a
forthright
position
and
say
that
you
cannot
have
elections
without
candidates.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor,
i
understand
and
that
is
very
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
your
honor,
i
believe
that
there
is
an
alternative
and
did
not
--
in
my
brief,
we
have
discussed
the
fact
that
you
do
need
to,
--
in
some
ways
make
sure
that
your
ballot
contains
a
reasonable
number
of
people
and
people
who
are
reasonably
serious
but
that
can
be
taken
care
of
by
the
requirement
of
petitions
and
signatures.
new
york
which
is
a
rival
to
california
in
every
way
handles
this
matter
very
well
with
petitions
and
they
don’t
worry
about
an
unwieldy
ballot
because
the
very
active
requiring
signatures
also
means
that
the
candidate
has
to
get
out
in
advance
and
make
himself
or
herself
known
to
the
people
and
the
community.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
but
your
honor,
we
are
dealing
with
the
very
basis
of
our
society.
we
are
dealing
with
the
political
system.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
not
only
to
articles
one
and
two
require
elected
legislature
and
executives,
but
that
article
4
section
4
provides
that
the
united
states
shall
guarantee
to
every
state
a
republican
form
of
government
and
the
republican
form
of
government
means
citizens
who
are
entitled
to
vote.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
no,
your
honor,
i
am
not.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
court
has
already.
in
fact,
in
san
antonio
v.
rodriguez
in
which
they
were
dealing
with
an
educational
problem
but
you
took
many
takers
of
decision
to
deal
with
the
fact
that
the
electoral
process
is
one
of
the
most
important
processes
to
our
form
or
government.
and,
i
only
mentioned
the
constitution
as
a
basis
and
i
am
not
unaware
of
the
fact
that
this
court
has
time
after
time
after
time
stress
the
importance
of
voting
that
it
is
in
fact
one
of
the
explicit
rights
guaranteed
in
the
constitution
and
therefore
has
to
be
protected
in
the
highest
way.
i
am
merely
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
your
honor
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
in
rodriguez,
you
made
the
distinction
between
implicit
and
explicit
and
you
said
that
an
item
such
as
education
and
very
many
other
important
kinds
of
rights,
maybe
very
important
but
were
not
protected
by
the
constitution
because
they
are
not
explicit.
and
then,
you
went
in
and
i
assumed
that
you
were
--
i
may
have
misread
your
opinion
although
i
did
read
it
several
times.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
you
then
went
into
the
importance
of
the
electoral
process
to
our
system.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
and,
not
only
that,
but
you
did
what
i
thought
was,
from
my
purposes
and
my
proprieties
for
this,
your
honor,
you
did
layout
very
carefully
the
line
of
cases
in
which
you
dealt
with
the
importance
of
this
right.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
and
my
only
--
i
am
attempting
here
to
point
out
that
the
right
to
be
a
candidate
may
one
day
in
the
future,
in
the
year
2000,
if
we
use
our
bookman’s
to
folders
notion
of
having
all
of
the
people
come
in
and
vote
via
two-way
television,
we
may
be
able
to
do
a
way
with
the
necessity
of
the
candidates
and
representatives,
but
right
now
that
is
our
system.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
right.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
it
was.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
no.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
no,
your
honor.
he
is
a
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
that
is
true,
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
no.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
no,
your
honor,
but
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
but
in
turner
versus
fouche
your
honor,
i
think
the
court
pointed
out
very
well
that
once
you
open
a
position
to
some
people,
then
you
cannot
discriminate
based
on
those
kinds
of
factors
which
are
protected
by
the
fourteenth
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
that
is
my
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
the
reason
i
suggested
the
second
part,
the
question
had
to
do
with
the
question
which
the
members
of
this
court
presented
to
me
that
is
whether
it
made
a
difference
whether
it
was
the
individuals
poverty
or
that
of
his
group.
and,
i
took
that
question
to
me
and
i
should
address
myself
to
the
rights
of
the
candidates
versus
the
rights
of
the
supporters
or
the
voters.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
your
honor,
if
you’re
talking
about
a
primary
election,
i
would
think
that
it
would
not
be
a
percentage
of
the
total
who
voted,
but
the
total
who
voted
in
that
particular
party
because
in
california,
we
have
four
parties,
two
of
which
are
minor
parties.
to
demand
that
they
have
the
same
percentage
of
the
vote
as
those
who
belong
to
the
majority
party
would
work
a
great
hardship.
they
might
not
even
have
that
many
people
in
their
party.
for
instance,
if
you
ask
for
2%
of
the
population,
the
american
independent
may
not
even
have
that
many
people
in
that
party
right
now
and
would
require
100%
of
their
membership.
so,
i
think
that
you
have
to
schedule
it
and
i
think
it
should
be
a
minimum
amount,
something
say
between
a
thousand
and
5000
signatures
in
a
fairly
large
district
and
something
scaled
down
in
a
smaller
district.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
that
would
be
a
statewide
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
i
believe
that
there
were,
for
instance,
the
piece
in
freedom
party,
they
have
30,000
members
registered
and
los
angeles
county
of
course
covers
400
miles.
i
covered
them
all
so
i
am
aware
of
them.
i
think
that
in
that
case,
you
might
want
1%
of
30,000
where
i
get
3.000
signatures.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
i
think
your
honor
that
poor
people
have
learned
to
walk
and
i
think
that
they
learned
to
get
out
and
knock
on
doors.
they
may
not
be
able
to
contribute
money
and
i
have
documented
fairly
well
the
fact
that
although
we
now
have
the
opportunity
to
mark
off
on
our
income
tax
forms,
the
right
to
give
a
dollar
to
the
party
of
our
choice
if
we
belong
to
a
major
party.
only
3%
of
the
people
nationwide
bothered
to
check
off
to
give
money
to
their
major
parties,
so
for
people
who
may
not
even
be
able
to
file
the
income
tax
returns,
they
cannot
give
money.
but,
they
will
be
go
out
and
knock
on
doors,
they
will
go
out
and
collect
signatures.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
we
require
in
california
that
the
person
who
is
collecting
the
signature
gets
certified
that
he
has
in
fact
obtained
those
signatures
from
the
people
that
he
says
they
were.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
on
some,
your
honor,
they
do,
but
california
provides
for
certification
rather
than
necessity
of
having
a
notary
public.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
except
that
there
is
also
a
provision
in
the
california
law
that
says
that
notaries
may
not
charge
fees
for
political
type
of
documents.
but
again
--
so
that
would
be.
i
will
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
in
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
had
considered
the
matter
prior
to
denying
it,
i
would
like
to
draw
to
your
attention
the
fact
that
in
my
experience,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california
generally
when
presented
with
the
writ
of
mandate
for
the
first
time
which
it
does
not
believe
it
has
sufficient
information
to
deal
with
kicks
it
back
to
the
appellate
court
for
decision.
and,
that
same
thing
happened
in
the
case
of
zapata
versus
davidson
to
24
california
appellate
decisions
third
823.
on
this
very
question
of
the
filing
fees
in
the
elections
that
we
were
talking
about,
that
case
were
sent
to
the
appellate
court
in
april,
one
month
after
the
supreme
court
had
denied
us
summarily.
and,
when
presented
with
a
writ
of
mandate
on
the
exact
same
question,
they
sent
it
to
zapata
versus
davidson.
and
the
appellate
court
determined
that
the
filing
fees
were
in
fact
unconstitutional
based
on
the
bullock.
so
i
would
like
at
this
time
to
draw
your
attention
to
a
case
which
has
not
been
cited
in
my
brief
and
that
is
a
zapata
versus
davidson,
24
c
a
third
283
and
that
is
a
1972
decision.
now
secondly,
i
would
like
to
discuss
very
briefly
the
question
of
the
reasonableness
of
the
california
fees.
when
counsel
leads
you
to
believe
that
texas
was
so
different
in
california,
i
believe
he
misstates
the
question
because
the
texas
fees
in
some
case
on
state
levels
were
less
than
those
charged
in
california.
as
i
read
the
texas
statute,
the
real
high
fees,
the
$6,000.00
and
$8,000.00
were
primarily
on
county
levels,
but
that
the
state
positions
ran
from
$150.00
to
$850.00
or
$1,000.00
and
that
is
exactly
where
california
is
at.
furthermore,
the
case
of
socialist
party
versus
all
was
cited
as
having
legitimized
california
filing
fees
but
that
is
a
1909
case.
and,
at
that
time,
california
had
filing
fees
ranging
from
$10.00
to
$50.00.
it
had
no
relationship
to
the
emoluments
of
office
and
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
that
is
true,
your
honor.
but
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
no,
i
do
not
believe
so,
your
honor.
but
the
question
that
was
raised
was
not
a
us
constitutional
question,
that
was
a
california
constitutional
question.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
but,
in
that
case,
the
dicta
was
to
the
effect
that
while
these
fees
were
reasonable
ranging
from
$10.00
to
$50.00,
that
if
the
fee
structure
had
been
based
on
the
emoluments
of
office
as
the
present
system
is
that
they
would
have
struck
it
down
because
such
a
fee
would
have
no
relationship
to
what
it
cost
to
run
on
election.
it
would
have
no
relationship
to
what
it
cost
to
file
the
papers.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
it
was,
in
1909
and
it
is
the
case
which
my
opponent
relies
upon
and
which
i
believe
judge
rehnquist
relied
upon
in
saying
that
california
fees
were
reasonable.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
your
honor,
i
really
object
to
the
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
if
it
cost
$10.00
to
print
up
the
forms
for
nominating
fees,
then
i
think
perhaps
that
could
be
reasonably
explained.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
you
are
right,
you
are
right,
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
it
does,
he
is
a
pauper.
he
cannot
afford
to
pay
the
fees.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
what
i
was
suggesting,
your
honor,
was
that
--
the
case
has
two
basis
really
and
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court
that
we
are
going
to
go
beyond
just
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
beyond
the
idea
that
paupers
should
have
the
fees
removed
but
we
should
be
looking
to
the
fact
that
all
people
have
a
right
to
participate
in
the
political
process.
because
my
client,
mr.
lubin
is
a
pauper,
but
he
is
also
something
else,
he
has
in
common
with
me
and
with
all
of
you
that
he
is
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
and
as
such
has
the
right
to
participate.
and,
i
think
that
placing
any
kind
of
a
fee
which
has
no
relationship
to
the
actual
cost
of
filing
the
papers
is
interfering
with
the
rights
of
all
citizens.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
not
by
using
fees,
your
honor.
not
by
using
a
monetary
standards.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
and
i
suggest
that
there
is
an
alternative.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
no,
i
am
suggesting
to
this
court
that
i
am
giving
you
the
opportunity
if
you
wish
to
take
it
to
broaden
the
scope
of
what
we
have
done
here
forward.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
when
we
are
talking
about
the
right
of
people
to
participate
in
the
political
system,
we
are
talking
about
the
--
i
cannot
give
you
the
exact
part
of
the
constitution
but
it
seems
to
me
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
what
i
am
suggesting,
your
honor,
is
that
the
constitution
as
a
whole
protects
the
political
process.
it
was
designed
to
assure
that
we
would
continue
to
have
a
republican
form
of
government
that
all
of
the
people
would
be
able
to
participate
by
voting.
now,
the
very
provisions
that
you
use
to
sustain
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
you
are
right,
your
honor,
but
we
may
have
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
at
that
point,
the
problem
with
our
system
was
that
it
did
not
recognized
those
people
as
people
and
that
is
to
the
shame
of
our
country.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
i
believe
that
for
instance,
well,
we
have
already
given
everybody
the
right
to
vote
via
the
decisions,
which
this
court
has
made,
but
it
did
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
i
am
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
i
am
remembering
several
cases
if
i
may
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
yes,
your
honor,
i
understand
that
involves
too.
well,
in
oregon
versus
mitchell,
your
brothers
harlan
and
brennan
both
discussed
the
fact
that
under
--
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
well,
both
brennan
and
harlan
in
oregon
versus
mitchell
said
that
the
right
to
be
a
candidate
was
inherent
in
the
right
to
vote
and
that
it
was
left
out
of
the
fifteenth
amendment
because
they
assumed
it
was
already
there.
ms.
marguerite
m.
buckley
thank
you,
your
honor.
