justice
thurgood
marshall
on
the
writ
of
mandate
in
california
is
an
extraordinary
writ
as
somewhat
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
isn’t
that
the
answer?
the
extraordinary
writ
the
opposite
of
an
appeal
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
unkind
is
it,
a
man
has
not
enough
money
to
put
up
his
filing
fee
and
you
say,
therefore,
he
put
on
to
additional
burden
and
not
been
able
to
go
out
and
get
people
to
know
him.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
i
understand
you,
he
could
not
get
there
anyhow.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
know
of
a
candidate
who
did
not
have
to
go
by
the
proper
route
but
he
paid
less
than
$100.00
and
elected
a
senator.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
my
whole
point
is
--
that
is
actually
correct.
if
the
man
is
broke
and
hasn’t
got
any
nickel,
is
there
any
way
under
the
sun
he
is
ever
going
to
be
known
to
anybody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
state
of
course,
did
somebody
give
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
doors
did
he
knockdown?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
that
he
went
to
16,000
doors
to
knock
on?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
okay.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
is
entirely
different
argument
from
all
of
these
things
by
that
he
can
get
on
tv
or
whatever.
is
your
argument
that
he
cannot
be
discriminated
solely
because
he
does
not
have
$850.00?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
and
no
more
--
is
that
your
argument?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
in
california
law
on
write-in
that
is
not
exactly
correct
with
the
--
started
and
fees
growth?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
that,
but
there
are
some
states
where
the
name,
if
you
leave
out
the
initial,
it
is
no
good.
is
that
true
in
california?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
gaylord,
is
there
anything
else
that
you
do
other
than
to
put
up
the
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
is
all?
i
mean,
what
is
it
that
you
find
that
he
is
a
responsible
person
other
than
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else?
anything
else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know,
the
$701.00.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
there
is
nothing
higher
than
the
money
that
determines
that
he
is
a
responsible
person,
nothing
else.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
the
man
with
$1,500.00
be
more
responsible
than
the
man
with
$750.00?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
so,
the
more
he
had,
the
more
responsible
it
would
be?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
hope
that
is
not
everybody’s
theory.
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
in
the
world
did
you
say
that
the
constitution
was
adapted,
there
was
a
lot
of
blacker
people
in
this
country
that
couldn’t
vote.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
could
they
have
been
set
up
to
do
that
if
it
did
not
allow
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
but
are
you
going
to
stand
that
now
to
give
everybody
the
right
to
vote?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
only
said
in
this
court
mainly
shall
not
discriminate,
so
i
want
you
to
show
me
the
one
that
said
the
right
to
pull
off.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then,
we
have
got
to
give
that
when
the
right
to
run
(inaudible)
justice
thurgood
marshall
(inaudible)
to
find
another
one.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
not
read
in
our
brief
we
are
going
to
fall
asleep
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
are
not
talking
about
discussion,
i‘m
saying,
where
they
said
that
there
was
a
right
to
vote
or
a
right
to
run
for
the
office.
