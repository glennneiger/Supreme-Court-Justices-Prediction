justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
buckley,
would
judge
weinkie's
ruling
have
been
appealable
itself
to
the
district
court
of
appeal
had
you
chosen
to
go
that
route?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
california
law,
is
that
necessarily
a
determination
on
the
merits,
their
denial
without
hearing
of
a
petition
over
extraordinary
writ?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
was
not
certiorari.
though
i
mean,
where
you
are
trying
to
get
before,
this
is
a
pledge
for
original
writ
of
mandate,
wasn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then,
their
denial
without
having
you
sit
in
is
necessarily
the
decision
on
the
merits,
they
don’t
in
their
practice
occasionally
simply
deny
this
disgression.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
write-in
candidate
not
an
established
--
write-in
candidate
not
entitled
the
equal
time
on
television?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
is
this
the
federal
communications
commission
ruling
that
you
are
relying
and/or
just
kind
of
your
own
judgment
of
what
the
law
to
be.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
familiar
with
the
pacific
telephone
case
ms.
buckley?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
that
is
the
case
where
this
court
held
that
the
republican
form
of
government
clause
was
not
justiciable
and
was
not
enforceable
by
the
courts.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
broader
argument
that
there
is
not
an
equal
protection
argument
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
clause
of
the
constitution
would
you
suggest
we
use
to
broaden?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
just
refer
to
a
number
or
a
section?
