mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
a
divided
panel
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
suppressing
certain
telephone
conversations
which
were
recorded
during
the
course
of
a
court
authorized
wire
interception
of
respondents’
telephone
pursuit
to
title
iii
of
the
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act
of
1968.
after
a
thorough
investigation,
the
results
of
which
are
detailed
in
an
affidavit
that
was
submitted
in
support
of
the
wire
interception
application
and
that’s
set
forth
at
pages
9
through
20
of
the
appendix,
federal
law
enforcement
agencies
developed
probable
cause
to
believe
that
irving
kahn
and
an
associate,
one
jacobs
were
involved
in
conducting
illegal
gambling
enterprises
in
violation
of
illinois
and
a
federal
law.
this
information
included
detail
statements
of
three
reliable
informants
which
were
checked
and
verified
in
various
ways,
including
examinations
of
telephone
records.
since
it
was
concluded
that
sufficient
evidence
to
prove
the
offense
and
to
illuminate
its
full
nature
and
extent,
including
the
identity
of
any
confederates,
could
not
be
procured
by
conventional
investigative
techniques,
an
application
was
made
to
judge
campbell
of
the
district
court
from
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
for
an
order
authorizing
interception
of
wire
communications
on
the
kahn
and
jacobs’
home
telephones.
this
order
was
issued
by
judge
campbell
on
march
20,
1970.
in
the
order,
he
made
the
following
findings,
this
is
at
page
21
of
the
appendix.
he
found
first
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
irving
kahn,
jake
jacobs,
and
others
as
yet
unknown
have
committed
and
are
committing
offenses
involving
the
use
of
interstate
telephone
communication
facilities
to
the
transmission
of
bets
and
betting
offenses.
he
secondly
found
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
particular
wire
communications
of
irving
kahn,
jake
jacobs,
and
unknown
others
concerning
these
offenses
will
be
obtained
through
the
interception
authorization
for
which
is
applied
for.
he
found
that
normal
investigative
procedures
reasonably
appeared
unlikely
to
succeed.
finally,
he
found
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
telephones
in
the
kahn
household
have
been
and
are
being
used
by
irving
kahn
and
others
as
yet
unknown
in
connection
with
the
commission
of
the
above
described
offenses.
therefore,
he
issued
an
order
which
authorized
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
to
intercept
wire
communications
of
irving
kahn
and
others
as
yet
unknown
concerning
the
above
described
offenses
to
and
from
the
kahn
household
telephones.
now,
he
provided
that
such
interception
would
not
automatically
terminate
with
the
first
conversation
that
was
intercepted,
but
that
it
shall
continue
and
this
is
on
page
23
of
the
appendix,
until
communications
are
intercepted
which
revealed
the
manner
in
which
irving
kahn,
jake
jacobs
and
others
as
yet
unknown
participate
in
the
illegal
use
of
interstate
telephone
facilities
for
the
transmission
of
bets
and
betting
information
in
an
aid
of
racketeering
enterprise,
and
which
revealed
the
identities
of
there
confederates,
their
places
of
operation
and
the
nature
of
the
conspiracy
involved
therein.
judge
campbell
authorized
this
interception
to
continue
for
a
period
of
15
days.
he
directed
as
a
statute
requires
that
efforts
be
made
to
minimize
the
interception
of
conversations
not
relating
to
the
offenses
under
investigation
and
he
provided
for
five-day
status
reports
by
the
attorney
applying
for
the
order.
now,
pursuant
to
this
authorization,
conversations
over
the
kahn
household
telephones
were
intercepted
for
five
days
beginning
on
the
evening
of
march
20th.
the
results
are
spelled
out
in
the
interim
status
report
at
page
26
of
the
appendix.
they
included
on
saturday,
march
21st,
the
first
full
day
of
the
interception
50
telephone
calls
approximately
involving
the
placing
of
bets
amounting
to
about
$15,000.00.
they
involved
conversations
between
irving
kahn
in
arizona
and
minnie
kahn
at
the
kahn
home
in
chicago
in
which
gambling
activities
and
losses
where
discussed.
these
conversations
provided
the
interstate
component
of
the
charge
under
18
u.s.c.
1952.
they
involved
also
in
that
the
same
day,
conversations
between
mrs.
kahn
and
unknown
gambling
figures
advising
of
the
number
of
bets
placed
the
amounts
of
these
bets,
the
identities
of
the
betters.
two
days
later
on
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
related
to
wagering.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
mean
mr.
and
mrs.
kahn?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
were
related
to
the
conduct
of
the
--
what
turned
out
to
be
the
kahn
family
gambling
enterprise.
and
i’ve
--
i
don’t
know
if
i'm
in
a
position
to
disclose
here
the
actual
content
of
the
conversations
beyond
what's
in
the
record.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
records
shows
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
it
was
relating
to
wagering.
i
think
if
there
was
some
problem,
whether
these
were
sufficient
to
establish
the
jurisdiction
along
with
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
is
an
offense
to
use
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
isn’t.
it
is
an
offense
to
--
under
1084
which
they
were
not
charged
under
to
transmit
wagering
information
over
interstate
law
and
such
as
the
latest
las
vegas
line
on
a
game
or
something
like
that.
it
is
an
offense
under
1952
which
the
kahns
were
charged
under
to
use
any
facility
in
interstate
commerce
with
the
intent
to
and
then
one
of
the
things
as
otherwise
promote
manage,
establish,
carry
on
or
facilitate
the
promotion,
management,
establishment,
or
carrying
on
of
any
unlawful
activity
which
is
defined
as
gambling.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
has
been
no
challenge
to
date
that
these
conversations
didn’t
come.
i
assume
that
a
motion
could
be
made
to
dismiss
the
indictment
at
some
subsequent
point.
but
then
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
are
not
that
stage
now.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
as
far
as
i
know
those
were
intrastate.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
now,
when
mr.
kahn
returned
from
arizona
to
chicago
on
monday,
he
had
further
conversations
with
known
gambling
figures
regarding
the
results
of
the
weekend's
wagering
activities.
in
view
of
the
success
of
the
interception
and
achieving
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
sought,
it
was
discontinued
after
five
days
rather
than
to
continuing
for
the
15
days
for
which
judge
campbell
had
authorized
it.
with
the
evidence
thus,
procured
irving
and
minnie
kahn
were
both
indicted
for
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
1952.
they
moved
to
suppress
the
evidence
procured
by
the
wire
interception
and
the
district
court
granted
the
suppression
motion.
first
of
all,
as
to
conversations
between
irving
and
minnie
on
marital
privilege
grounds;
secondly,
as
to
all
conversations
of
minnie
because
the
interception
was
not
authorized
by
judge
campbell’s
order
in
the
view
of
the
district
court;
thirdly,
as
to
all
conversations
in
which
irving
did
not
participate
on
the
same
grounds.
on
the
government’s
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
reverse
on
the
marital
privilege
holding
but
it
affirmed
the
suppression
of
all
conversations
of
minnie
kahn
on
the
ground
that
she
was
not
a
person
unknown
within
the
meaning
of
judge
campbell’s
order.
in
so
doing
the
court
construed
the
statutory
requirement
for
identification
of
a
person
if
known
in
the
application
and
in
the
order
to
require
the
naming
of
any
known
user
of
the
phone
whose
complicity
in
the
offense
might
have
been
discoverable
by
careful
investigation.
it
found
that
the
government
had
not
prove
that
minnie
kahn
was
not
such
a
person.
this
evidentiary
finding
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
made
without
any
record
having
been
developed
on
the
subject
and
indeed
i
suggest
that
the
affidavit
of
the
fbi
agent,
at
top
page
11
of
the
appendix,
indicates
that
the
belief
of
the
investigating
officials
at
the
time
was
that
if
irving
kahn
was
not
there,
the
bets
would
be
routed
through
jake
jacobs.
so,
there
are
some
question
about
the
correctness
of
the
court
of
appeals
conclusion
on
this
regard.
the
court
of
appeals
also
construed
judge
campbell’s
order
to
authorize
only
the
interception
of
conversations
of
the
irving
kahn,
in
other
words,
he
had
to
participate
in
all
the
conversations
and
the
other
party
had
to
be
a
person
unknown.
it
considered
this
construction
of
the
statute
in
order
to
comport
with
a
policy
of
protecting
individual
privacy
and
to
avoid
making
interception
authorizations
a
virtual
general
warrant
as
it
put
it,
judge
stevens
dissented.
now,
we
submit
the
minnie
kahn
was
a
person
unknown
within
the
meaning
of
both
the
statute
and
the
order.
and
that
the
interception
of
her
conversations
regarding
the
illegal
gambling
enterprise
was
lawful
and
proper
and
produced
evidence
fully
usable
in
the
criminal
prosecutions.
in
order
to
remove
any
possible
confusion,
i’d
like
to
begin
by
indicating
what
this
case
does
not
involve.
it
does
not
involve
the
general
facial
constitutionality
of
title
iii,
the
wire
interception
provisions
of
the
omnibus
crime
control
act.
these
by
the
way
have
been
uniformly
upheld
by
the
lower
courts
were
challenged
with
the
exception
of
one
subsequently
reversed
district
court’s
opinion
in
philadelphia.
secondly,
it
does
not
involve
any
finding
that
the
government
in
fact
knew
that
minnie
kahn
was
involved
in
the
illegal
enterprise
and
that
she
was
in
fact
a
target
of
this
government
investigation,
but
the
government
failed
to
name
her
in
the
application.
no
such
finding
was
involved.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
there
is
no
finding
in
this
case,
there
is
no
contention
to
this
point
that
the
government
actually
knew
minnie
kahn
to
be
involved
in
this
gambling
enterprise
and
for
reasons
that
the
escape
me
as
far
as
motive,
declined
to
name
her
in
the
application
for
the
wire
interception.
it
is
not
like
the
situation
that
you
spoke
of
in
coolidge
where
they
knew
perfectly
well
they
are
going
to
intercept
criminal
conversations
of
hers
and
didn’t
name
her
in
the
authorization.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
if
a
case
arose
where
that
was
a
problem,
i
would
be
prepared
to
argue
that
the
--
although,
i
think
that
is
analogous
to
the
position
that
the
plain
view
of
discussion
of
coolidge
which
was
joined
then
by
four
justices
took.
that
is,
if
the
government
knew
and
had
as
a
target
a
and
b,
and
it
only
named
a,
and
it
didn’t
name
b,
although
b
was
a
target
of
the
investigation
and
they
have
probable
cause.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
oh,
absolutely
it
can.
if
it
has
a
court
order
authorizing
it
to
intercept
conversations
over
that
phone,
if
it’s
met
the
probable
cause
requirements
of
the
statute.
it
doesn’t
have
to
name
a
soul
if
it
doesn’t
know
anyone.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that’s
an
interesting
question
and
i
might
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
[voice
overlap]
no
i
don’t
believe
it
is
involved
in
this
case
justice
white
because
here,
there
was
not
a
situation
where
the
government
knew
that
minnie
kahn
was
involved.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
would
be
our
contention
that
even
if
the
government
did,
it
could
still
at
least
intercept
irving’s
conversation
with
her.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
might
be
a
more
difficult
case,
although
i
would
be
prepared
to
argue
that
the
interceptions
was
involved
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don’t
need
to
justice
stewart.
now,
finally
there
is
no
allegation
that
there
was
failure
to
minimize
here.
that
is,
there
is
no
claim
made
to
date
that
the
government
improperly
listened
to
innocent
conversations.
we
are
talking
here
about
the
interception
of
conversations
about
a
criminal
enterprise.
i’d
like
first
to
dispose
of
judge
campbell’s
order.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
was
about
to
start
yesterday
with
the
discussion
of
judge
campbell’s
order
authorizing
the
wire
interception
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
read
the
order
as
though
it
was
limited
until
the
interception
of
conversations
of
irving
kahn
with
persons
unknown,
that
is,
only
conversations
between
irving
and
persons
unknown.
in
fact,
the
order
read
conversations
of
irving
kahn
and
others
as
yet
unknown.
we
submit
that
it’s
clear
as
judge
stevens
indicated
in
his
dissent
that
that
would
authorize
the
interception
of
all
the
conversations
that
are
in
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
certainly.
any
conversations
over
those
phones
relating
to
the
gambling
offenses
would
be
covered
by
the
order.
this
is
a
standard
form
of
language
that
wire
interception
orders
almost
routinely,
contained
where
there’s
not
any
special
restriction
that’s
intended
to
be
imposed
on
the
scope
of
the
reception.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
let
me
begin
by
saying
that,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
i
think
there
is
no
requirement
of
identifying
the
person
so
long
as
the
conversation
so
identified
was
sufficient
particularity.
now,
justice
white
was
touching
on
this
question
yesterday
whether,
as
a
statutory
matter,
congress
intended
some
sanction
or
suppression
to
result
from
such
a
laps
on
the
government’s
part.
now,
i
think
that
the
consequence
of
saying
that
after
the
interception
has
been
completed
and
the
prosecution
is
broad,
and
these
are
frequently,
highly
complex
prosecutions
with
numerous
defendants
involving
a
far-reaching
conspiracy,
the
government
should
not
be
put
to
the
proof
of
showing
with
respect
to
every
conversation
that
it
did
in
some
way
or
somehow,
have
a
probable
cause
that
somebody
could
dredge
up
on
the
basis
of
which
they
might
have
anticipated
intercepting
the
conversations
of
some
individual.
so,
i
think
it
would
be
our
position
that
as
long
as
you
name
the
primary
target
of
the
investigation
whose
zone
of
privacy
you’re
expecting
to
intrude
upon
which,
in
this
case,
would
be
irving
kahn
and
his
household
telephone.
that
that
should
suffice
and
that,
then
all
unlawful
conversations
over
the
phone
can
be
intercepted.
now,
the
statute
is
quite
clear
and
the
court
of
appeals,
in
referring
to
the
statute,
did
not
fully
quote
it
in
discussing
this
“if
known”
problem.
section
2518
(1)
provides
that
the
order
of
the
application
for
the
wire
interception
order
shall
contain
certain
information.
in
subsection
(b)
(iv),
it
requires
--
the
government
indicates
“the
identity
of
the
person,
if
known,
committing
the
offense
and
whose
conversations
are
to
be
intercepted.”
now,
two
things
emerge
from
this
provision
with,
we
submit,
indisputable
clarity.
the
first
is
that
it
concerns
persons
if
known
to
be
committing
the
offense,
and
not
just
persons
who
are
known
in
some
other
broader
or
vaguer
sense.
the
second
is
that
the
statute
contemplates
circumstances
in
which
no
one
may
be
known
and,
therefore,
no
one
need
be
named
yet,
nevertheless,
the
government
may
apply
for
and
obtain
from
a
judge
an
order
authorizing
a
wire
interception.
that
might
be
the
case,
say,
if
you
had
a
cigar
store
or
a
pool
hall
where
you
knew
gambling
or
drug
business
was
being
conducted
over
telephone
but
you
did
not
know
the
identities
of
people.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
would
say,
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
no
one
is
known,
no
one
need
be
named.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
think
it
is.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
begin
with
there
being
no
constitutional
requirement
for
this
identification
and
then
we
look
to
see
whether
the
statute
has
imposed
requirements.
in
addition
to
those,
there
would
be
required
for
a
conventional
search
warrant
and
the
requirement
should
be
read,
at
most,
to
require
what
it
specifically
says.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
subsection
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
subsection
(iv)?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
believe
that
that
cannot
be
read
to
have
any
significance
because
the
only
source
of
information
for
the
judge’s
order
which
that
subsection
deals
with
is
the
application
that’s
been
submitted
to
him.
if
we’re
not
required
to
identify
the
application
other
known
persons
whose
conversations
may
be
intercepted,
then
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
we
would
suggest
that
and
we
see,
it
seems
to
us,
logically
inescapable
to
do
that.
now,
one
of
the
underlying
concerns,
i
think,
in
the
case
of
this
sort
is
the
difficulty
of
the
possibility
that
conversations
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
excuse
me.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
legislative
history
on
this
is
very,
very
limited.
these
provisions,
the
“if
known”
provisions
were
not
in
the
original
bill.
they
were
in
professor
blakey’s
version
and
he
was
counsel
to
the
committee,
and
as
the
bill
emerged
from
the
committee,
it
contained
the
“if
known”
provisions.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
as
they
are
now
and
there
was
an
explanation
which
was
the
typical
recitation
of
what
they
provide
with,
aside
to
a
case
called
west
against
cabell,
which
dealt
with
arrest
warrants
and
not
with
search
warrants
and
--
which
is
a
little
difficult
to
understand
why
it
was
even
referred
to.
now,
there
is
a
legitimate
concern
with
the
problem
of
intercepting
innocent
conversations
and
conversations
of
innocent
persons
who
may
be
in
the
household
or
who
otherwise
may
be
calling
in
or
out
from
the
intercepted
telephones.
but
i
think
it’s
clear
that
congress
anticipated
that
this
was
inevitable
and
that
indeed,
any
wire
interception
must
necessarily
entail
some
limited
degree
of
interception
of
innocent
persons
or
innocent
conversations.
i’d
like
to
give
some
examples
of
some
typical
conversations
which
i
think
will
make
this
clear.
first
of
all,
we
have
--
the
phone
rings
and,
let’s
say,
mrs.
kahn
picks
up
the
phone
and
says
“hello.”
now,
at
this
point,
the
question
is
should
the
people
monitoring
simply
turn
the
recording
off
right
away
because
it’s
not
irving
kahn.
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
quite
clear
because
the
next
--
and
the
answer
is,
clearly,
no.
they
can’t
turn
it
off
at
that
point
because
the
next
words
may
be
“is
irving
at
home?”
“yes,
i’ll
put
him
right
on
the
phone.”
now,
if
they
can
listen
past
the
hello,
past
the
time
that
minnie
kahn
gets
on
the
phone,
the
next
question
may
be
or
the
next
statement
may
be
“i’d
like
to
bet
$500
on
the
bears.
what’s
the
spread?”
and
she
may
say
“well,
it’s
5
points,
but
you
owe
us
$1,000
and
we
can’t
take
any
more
bets
from
you.”
well,
since
they
have
to
be
allowed
to
hear
this
far
into
the
conversation,
once
this
has
been
monitored,
lawfully
monitored,
there’s
no
policy
either
constitutional
or
statutory
that
could
possibly
be
served
by
saying
“well,
they
heard
it
but
they
can’t
use
it
in
evidence.
they
can’t
use
it
to
prove
the
offense
because
they
didn’t
name
minnie
in
the
order.”
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
there’s
no
doubt
of
that
and,
with
the
exception
of
this
court,
every
court
has
held
that
where
the
name
target
as
one
of
the
parties
to
the
conversation,
that
conversation
can
be
intercepted.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
seventh
circuit,
i
beg
your
pardon,
yes.
here,
we
have
two
categories
of
conversations:
the
conversations
between
irving
and
minnie
as
to
which
i
can’t
understand
any
basis
for
excluding
those
so
long
as
they
deal
with
the
illegal
gambling
enterprise.
since
irving
was
named
in
the
order,
he
was
a
person
whose
zone
of
privacy
was
being
lawfully
invaded
pursuant
to
this
warrant.
he
did
conduct
conversations
about
the
gambling
enterprise.
i
could
see
no
basis
for
suppressing
those.
now,
similarly,
with
respect
to
the
conversations
between
minnie
and
third
parties
where
she
was
transmitting
gambling
information
or
taking
bets
in
violation
of
state
law
thereto.
they
were
properly
on
the
phone.
they
properly
heard
these
conversations,
and
they
had
to.
as
you
can
see
from
the
examples
that
i’ve
cited,
i
think
there’s
no
basis
than
in
a
justification,
no
policy
reasons
for
excluding
them.
now,
i
see
my
time
is
running
short.
i
think
that
i’d
just
like
to
make
one
or
two
more
comments
and
then
save
the
balance
of
my
time.
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
somehow
the
government
should
have
conducted
a
further
investigation
of
mrs.
kahn
which
they
thought
might
have
disclosed
her
complicity
in
the
illegal
enterprise.
we
suggest,
and
we’ve
argued
this
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
that
this
does
not
serve
mrs.
kahn’s
privacy
interest.
it
does
not
serve
any
privacy
interest
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
designed
to
protect.
since
whether
or
not
the
investigation
disclosed
her
complicity,
the
interception
of
her
conversations
could
still
take
place.
finally,
on
the
standing
point
which
we
also
advert
to
in
the
last
section
of
our
brief,
i’d
simply
like
to
cite
alderman,
footnote
9,
in
justice
white’s
opinion
in
alderman.
there
is
a
discussion
of
the
standing
problem
and
there
is
a
reference
to
the
legislative
history
which
is
at
page
91
of
the
senate
report
1097.
and
it
was
quite
clear
there
that
the
normal
fourth
amendment
constitutional
standing
rule
was
intended
to
be
adopted
in
these
wire
interception
cases
and,
under
that
rule,
we
think
it’s
clear
here
that
any
defect
that
may
have
existed
was
purely
personal
to
minnie
kahn,
and
irving
kahn
should
have
no
standing
to
raise
the
issue.
if
there
are
no
questions
at
this
time,
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
a
few
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
of
course,
i’d
like
to
point
out
that
there’s
no
fifth
amendment
problem
in
this
case
since
there
was
no
compelled
statement
or
testimony
of
any
sort.
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
la
gorga
case,
the
health
club
case
that
counsel
adverted
to,
public
phones,
phones
in
public
places
are
different
from
phones
in
a
private
home.
katz
case
involved
a
public
phone.
there
was,
indeed,
an
amendment
proposed
to
congress
to
this
bill
and
which
was
recommended
by
the
justice
department
but
which
was
never
voted
on
or
adopted
which,
in
the
case
of
public
phones,
would’ve
permitted
only
the
interception
of
conversations
of
the
named
party.
for
obvious
reasons,
you
would
have
no
basis
for
expecting
to
receive
any
information
relating
to
your
investigation
from
conversations
on
a
public
phone
except
by
those
of
the
named
party.
that
is
not
at
all
true
in
this
situation
where
you’re
intercepting
conversations
over
a
private
phone.
frequently,
in
these
cases,
there
are
organized
crime
cases;
you’re
dealing
with
sophisticated
conspiracies.
it’s
not
uncommon
particularly
in
narcotics
cases
to
have
two
quite
innocent
people
start
a
conversation
and
then,
in
the
middle
of
the
conversation,
all
of
a
sudden
you
have
two
completely
different
people
who
are
on
the
phone
talking
in
code
about
narcotics
transactions.
in
this
case,
indeed,
some
of
the
conversations
were
in
yiddish
between
irving
and
minnie
kahn.
with
respect
to
what’s
in
the
record
and
what
isn’t
in
the
record
that
is
a
little
confusing.
the
record
in
the
wire
interception
authorization
proceeding,
which
is
technically
a
civil
proceeding,
was
sealed
and
it
did
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
technically,
the
tapes
of
the
recordings
were
part
of
the
record.
in
fact,
i
think
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
listened
to
any
of
the
conversations
or
relied
upon
the
content
of
any
of
the
conversations,
the
specific
content,
in
reaching
its
decisions.
now,
the
notice
issue
which
counsel
discussed
is,
of
course,
not
before
this
court
or
was
not
involved
in
the
grant
of
certiorari.
moreover,
it’s
clear
that
the
district
court
has
discretion
to
require
notice,
service
of
the
inventory
notice,
except
to
the
named
party.
here,
the
named
party
was
irving
kahn.
he
received
service
of
the
notice.
there
was
no
defect
in
that
regard.
and
finally,
with
respect
to
the
standing
point,
it
is
true
that
the
statute
defines
a
person
aggrieved
quite
broadly
for
standing
purposes.
but
we’ve
indicated
in
our
brief
our
position,
we
think
this
is
supported
by
the
discussion
in
alderman,
that
the
target
of
the
interception,
the
person
whose
phone
is
being
intercepted
is
conferred
broad
standing
for
the
purpose
of
challenging
the
legality
of
the
entry
onto
his
telephone
line
just
as
the
home
owner
is
conferred
broad
standing
for
the
purpose
of
challenging
the
entry
into
his
house.
if
something
illegal
inside
his
house
or
on
the
line
is
found
but
only
affects
another
person,
he
should
not
be
granted
standing
to
challenge
it.
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
a
divided
panel
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
suppressing
certain
telephone
conversations
which
were
recorded
during
the
course
of
a
court
authorized
wire
interception
of
respondents’
telephone
pursuit
to
title
iii
of
the
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act
of
1968.
after
a
thorough
investigation,
the
results
of
which
are
detailed
in
an
affidavit
that
was
submitted
in
support
of
the
wire
interception
application
and
that’s
set
forth
at
pages
9
through
20
of
the
appendix,
federal
law
enforcement
agencies
developed
probable
cause
to
believe
that
irving
kahn
and
an
associate,
one
jacobs
were
involved
in
conducting
illegal
gambling
enterprises
in
violation
of
illinois
and
a
federal
law.
this
information
included
detail
statements
of
three
reliable
informants
which
were
checked
and
verified
in
various
ways,
including
examinations
of
telephone
records.
since
it
was
concluded
that
sufficient
evidence
to
prove
the
offense
and
to
illuminate
its
full
nature
and
extent,
including
the
identity
of
any
confederates,
could
not
be
procured
by
conventional
investigative
techniques,
an
application
was
made
to
judge
campbell
of
the
district
court
from
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
for
an
order
authorizing
interception
of
wire
communications
on
the
kahn
and
jacobs’
home
telephones.
this
order
was
issued
by
judge
campbell
on
march
20,
1970.
in
the
order,
he
made
the
following
findings,
this
is
at
page
21
of
the
appendix.
he
found
first
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
irving
kahn,
jake
jacobs,
and
others
as
yet
unknown
have
committed
and
are
committing
offenses
involving
the
use
of
interstate
telephone
communication
facilities
to
the
transmission
of
bets
and
betting
offenses.
he
secondly
found
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
particular
wire
communications
of
irving
kahn,
jake
jacobs,
and
unknown
others
concerning
these
offenses
will
be
obtained
through
the
interception
authorization
for
which
is
applied
for.
he
found
that
normal
investigative
procedures
reasonably
appeared
unlikely
to
succeed.
finally,
he
found
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
telephones
in
the
kahn
household
have
been
and
are
being
used
by
irving
kahn
and
others
as
yet
unknown
in
connection
with
the
commission
of
the
above
described
offenses.
therefore,
he
issued
an
order
which
authorized
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
to
intercept
wire
communications
of
irving
kahn
and
others
as
yet
unknown
concerning
the
above
described
offenses
to
and
from
the
kahn
household
telephones.
now,
he
provided
that
such
interception
would
not
automatically
terminate
with
the
first
conversation
that
was
intercepted,
but
that
it
shall
continue
and
this
is
on
page
23
of
the
appendix,
until
communications
are
intercepted
which
revealed
the
manner
in
which
irving
kahn,
jake
jacobs
and
others
as
yet
unknown
participate
in
the
illegal
use
of
interstate
telephone
facilities
for
the
transmission
of
bets
and
betting
information
in
an
aid
of
racketeering
enterprise,
and
which
revealed
the
identities
of
there
confederates,
their
places
of
operation
and
the
nature
of
the
conspiracy
involved
therein.
judge
campbell
authorized
this
interception
to
continue
for
a
period
of
15
days.
he
directed
as
a
statute
requires
that
efforts
be
made
to
minimize
the
interception
of
conversations
not
relating
to
the
offenses
under
investigation
and
he
provided
for
five-day
status
reports
by
the
attorney
applying
for
the
order.
now,
pursuant
to
this
authorization,
conversations
over
the
kahn
household
telephones
were
intercepted
for
five
days
beginning
on
the
evening
of
march
20th.
the
results
are
spelled
out
in
the
interim
status
report
at
page
26
of
the
appendix.
they
included
on
saturday,
march
21st,
the
first
full
day
of
the
interception
50
telephone
calls
approximately
involving
the
placing
of
bets
amounting
to
about
$15,000.00.
they
involved
conversations
between
irving
kahn
in
arizona
and
minnie
kahn
at
the
kahn
home
in
chicago
in
which
gambling
activities
and
losses
where
discussed.
these
conversations
provided
the
interstate
component
of
the
charge
under
18
u.s.c.
1952.
they
involved
also
in
that
the
same
day,
conversations
between
mrs.
kahn
and
unknown
gambling
figures
advising
of
the
number
of
bets
placed
the
amounts
of
these
bets,
the
identities
of
the
betters.
two
days
later
on
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
related
to
wagering.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
you
mean
mr.
and
mrs.
kahn?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
were
related
to
the
conduct
of
the
--
what
turned
out
to
be
the
kahn
family
gambling
enterprise.
and
i’ve
--
i
don’t
know
if
i'm
in
a
position
to
disclose
here
the
actual
content
of
the
conversations
beyond
what's
in
the
record.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
records
shows
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
it
was
relating
to
wagering.
i
think
if
there
was
some
problem,
whether
these
were
sufficient
to
establish
the
jurisdiction
along
with
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
is
an
offense
to
use
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
isn’t.
it
is
an
offense
to
--
under
1084
which
they
were
not
charged
under
to
transmit
wagering
information
over
interstate
law
and
such
as
the
latest
las
vegas
line
on
a
game
or
something
like
that.
it
is
an
offense
under
1952
which
the
kahns
were
charged
under
to
use
any
facility
in
interstate
commerce
with
the
intent
to
and
then
one
of
the
things
as
otherwise
promote
manage,
establish,
carry
on
or
facilitate
the
promotion,
management,
establishment,
or
carrying
on
of
any
unlawful
activity
which
is
defined
as
gambling.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there
has
been
no
challenge
to
date
that
these
conversations
didn’t
come.
i
assume
that
a
motion
could
be
made
to
dismiss
the
indictment
at
some
subsequent
point.
but
then
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
are
not
that
stage
now.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
as
far
as
i
know
those
were
intrastate.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
now,
when
mr.
kahn
returned
from
arizona
to
chicago
on
monday,
he
had
further
conversations
with
known
gambling
figures
regarding
the
results
of
the
weekend's
wagering
activities.
in
view
of
the
success
of
the
interception
and
achieving
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
sought,
it
was
discontinued
after
five
days
rather
than
to
continuing
for
the
15
days
for
which
judge
campbell
had
authorized
it.
with
the
evidence
thus,
procured
irving
and
minnie
kahn
were
both
indicted
for
violation
of
18
u.s.c.
1952.
they
moved
to
suppress
the
evidence
procured
by
the
wire
interception
and
the
district
court
granted
the
suppression
motion.
first
of
all,
as
to
conversations
between
irving
and
minnie
on
marital
privilege
grounds;
secondly,
as
to
all
conversations
of
minnie
because
the
interception
was
not
authorized
by
judge
campbell’s
order
in
the
view
of
the
district
court;
thirdly,
as
to
all
conversations
in
which
irving
did
not
participate
on
the
same
grounds.
on
the
government’s
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
reverse
on
the
marital
privilege
holding
but
it
affirmed
the
suppression
of
all
conversations
of
minnie
kahn
on
the
ground
that
she
was
not
a
person
unknown
within
the
meaning
of
judge
campbell’s
order.
in
so
doing
the
court
construed
the
statutory
requirement
for
identification
of
a
person
if
known
in
the
application
and
in
the
order
to
require
the
naming
of
any
known
user
of
the
phone
whose
complicity
in
the
offense
might
have
been
discoverable
by
careful
investigation.
it
found
that
the
government
had
not
prove
that
minnie
kahn
was
not
such
a
person.
this
evidentiary
finding
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
made
without
any
record
having
been
developed
on
the
subject
and
indeed
i
suggest
that
the
affidavit
of
the
fbi
agent,
at
top
page
11
of
the
appendix,
indicates
that
the
belief
of
the
investigating
officials
at
the
time
was
that
if
irving
kahn
was
not
there,
the
bets
would
be
routed
through
jake
jacobs.
so,
there
are
some
question
about
the
correctness
of
the
court
of
appeals
conclusion
on
this
regard.
the
court
of
appeals
also
construed
judge
campbell’s
order
to
authorize
only
the
interception
of
conversations
of
the
irving
kahn,
in
other
words,
he
had
to
participate
in
all
the
conversations
and
the
other
party
had
to
be
a
person
unknown.
it
considered
this
construction
of
the
statute
in
order
to
comport
with
a
policy
of
protecting
individual
privacy
and
to
avoid
making
interception
authorizations
a
virtual
general
warrant
as
it
put
it,
judge
stevens
dissented.
now,
we
submit
the
minnie
kahn
was
a
person
unknown
within
the
meaning
of
both
the
statute
and
the
order.
and
that
the
interception
of
her
conversations
regarding
the
illegal
gambling
enterprise
was
lawful
and
proper
and
produced
evidence
fully
usable
in
the
criminal
prosecutions.
in
order
to
remove
any
possible
confusion,
i’d
like
to
begin
by
indicating
what
this
case
does
not
involve.
it
does
not
involve
the
general
facial
constitutionality
of
title
iii,
the
wire
interception
provisions
of
the
omnibus
crime
control
act.
these
by
the
way
have
been
uniformly
upheld
by
the
lower
courts
were
challenged
with
the
exception
of
one
subsequently
reversed
district
court’s
opinion
in
philadelphia.
secondly,
it
does
not
involve
any
finding
that
the
government
in
fact
knew
that
minnie
kahn
was
involved
in
the
illegal
enterprise
and
that
she
was
in
fact
a
target
of
this
government
investigation,
but
the
government
failed
to
name
her
in
the
application.
no
such
finding
was
involved.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
there
is
no
finding
in
this
case,
there
is
no
contention
to
this
point
that
the
government
actually
knew
minnie
kahn
to
be
involved
in
this
gambling
enterprise
and
for
reasons
that
the
escape
me
as
far
as
motive,
declined
to
name
her
in
the
application
for
the
wire
interception.
it
is
not
like
the
situation
that
you
spoke
of
in
coolidge
where
they
knew
perfectly
well
they
are
going
to
intercept
criminal
conversations
of
hers
and
didn’t
name
her
in
the
authorization.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
if
a
case
arose
where
that
was
a
problem,
i
would
be
prepared
to
argue
that
the
--
although,
i
think
that
is
analogous
to
the
position
that
the
plain
view
of
discussion
of
coolidge
which
was
joined
then
by
four
justices
took.
that
is,
if
the
government
knew
and
had
as
a
target
a
and
b,
and
it
only
named
a,
and
it
didn’t
name
b,
although
b
was
a
target
of
the
investigation
and
they
have
probable
cause.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
oh,
absolutely
it
can.
if
it
has
a
court
order
authorizing
it
to
intercept
conversations
over
that
phone,
if
it’s
met
the
probable
cause
requirements
of
the
statute.
it
doesn’t
have
to
name
a
soul
if
it
doesn’t
know
anyone.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that’s
an
interesting
question
and
i
might
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
[voice
overlap]
no
i
don’t
believe
it
is
involved
in
this
case
justice
white
because
here,
there
was
not
a
situation
where
the
government
knew
that
minnie
kahn
was
involved.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
would
be
our
contention
that
even
if
the
government
did,
it
could
still
at
least
intercept
irving’s
conversation
with
her.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it
might
be
a
more
difficult
case,
although
i
would
be
prepared
to
argue
that
the
interceptions
was
involved
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
don’t
need
to
justice
stewart.
now,
finally
there
is
no
allegation
that
there
was
failure
to
minimize
here.
that
is,
there
is
no
claim
made
to
date
that
the
government
improperly
listened
to
innocent
conversations.
we
are
talking
here
about
the
interception
of
conversations
about
a
criminal
enterprise.
i’d
like
first
to
dispose
of
judge
campbell’s
order.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
i
was
about
to
start
yesterday
with
the
discussion
of
judge
campbell’s
order
authorizing
the
wire
interception
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
read
the
order
as
though
it
was
limited
until
the
interception
of
conversations
of
irving
kahn
with
persons
unknown,
that
is,
only
conversations
between
irving
and
persons
unknown.
in
fact,
the
order
read
conversations
of
irving
kahn
and
others
as
yet
unknown.
we
submit
that
it’s
clear
as
judge
stevens
indicated
in
his
dissent
that
that
would
authorize
the
interception
of
all
the
conversations
that
are
in
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
certainly.
any
conversations
over
those
phones
relating
to
the
gambling
offenses
would
be
covered
by
the
order.
this
is
a
standard
form
of
language
that
wire
interception
orders
almost
routinely,
contained
where
there’s
not
any
special
restriction
that’s
intended
to
be
imposed
on
the
scope
of
the
reception.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
let
me
begin
by
saying
that,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
i
think
there
is
no
requirement
of
identifying
the
person
so
long
as
the
conversation
so
identified
was
sufficient
particularity.
now,
justice
white
was
touching
on
this
question
yesterday
whether,
as
a
statutory
matter,
congress
intended
some
sanction
or
suppression
to
result
from
such
a
laps
on
the
government’s
part.
now,
i
think
that
the
consequence
of
saying
that
after
the
interception
has
been
completed
and
the
prosecution
is
broad,
and
these
are
frequently,
highly
complex
prosecutions
with
numerous
defendants
involving
a
far-reaching
conspiracy,
the
government
should
not
be
put
to
the
proof
of
showing
with
respect
to
every
conversation
that
it
did
in
some
way
or
somehow,
have
a
probable
cause
that
somebody
could
dredge
up
on
the
basis
of
which
they
might
have
anticipated
intercepting
the
conversations
of
some
individual.
so,
i
think
it
would
be
our
position
that
as
long
as
you
name
the
primary
target
of
the
investigation
whose
zone
of
privacy
you’re
expecting
to
intrude
upon
which,
in
this
case,
would
be
irving
kahn
and
his
household
telephone.
that
that
should
suffice
and
that,
then
all
unlawful
conversations
over
the
phone
can
be
intercepted.
now,
the
statute
is
quite
clear
and
the
court
of
appeals,
in
referring
to
the
statute,
did
not
fully
quote
it
in
discussing
this
“if
known”
problem.
section
2518
(1)
provides
that
the
order
of
the
application
for
the
wire
interception
order
shall
contain
certain
information.
in
subsection
(b)
(iv),
it
requires
--
the
government
indicates
“the
identity
of
the
person,
if
known,
committing
the
offense
and
whose
conversations
are
to
be
intercepted.”
now,
two
things
emerge
from
this
provision
with,
we
submit,
indisputable
clarity.
the
first
is
that
it
concerns
persons
if
known
to
be
committing
the
offense,
and
not
just
persons
who
are
known
in
some
other
broader
or
vaguer
sense.
the
second
is
that
the
statute
contemplates
circumstances
in
which
no
one
may
be
known
and,
therefore,
no
one
need
be
named
yet,
nevertheless,
the
government
may
apply
for
and
obtain
from
a
judge
an
order
authorizing
a
wire
interception.
that
might
be
the
case,
say,
if
you
had
a
cigar
store
or
a
pool
hall
where
you
knew
gambling
or
drug
business
was
being
conducted
over
telephone
but
you
did
not
know
the
identities
of
people.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
would
say,
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
no
one
is
known,
no
one
need
be
named.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
think
it
is.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
we
begin
with
there
being
no
constitutional
requirement
for
this
identification
and
then
we
look
to
see
whether
the
statute
has
imposed
requirements.
in
addition
to
those,
there
would
be
required
for
a
conventional
search
warrant
and
the
requirement
should
be
read,
at
most,
to
require
what
it
specifically
says.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
in
subsection
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
subsection
(iv)?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
we
believe
that
that
cannot
be
read
to
have
any
significance
because
the
only
source
of
information
for
the
judge’s
order
which
that
subsection
deals
with
is
the
application
that’s
been
submitted
to
him.
if
we’re
not
required
to
identify
the
application
other
known
persons
whose
conversations
may
be
intercepted,
then
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
we
would
suggest
that
and
we
see,
it
seems
to
us,
logically
inescapable
to
do
that.
now,
one
of
the
underlying
concerns,
i
think,
in
the
case
of
this
sort
is
the
difficulty
of
the
possibility
that
conversations
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
excuse
me.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
legislative
history
on
this
is
very,
very
limited.
these
provisions,
the
“if
known”
provisions
were
not
in
the
original
bill.
they
were
in
professor
blakey’s
version
and
he
was
counsel
to
the
committee,
and
as
the
bill
emerged
from
the
committee,
it
contained
the
“if
known”
provisions.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
as
they
are
now
and
there
was
an
explanation
which
was
the
typical
recitation
of
what
they
provide
with,
aside
to
a
case
called
west
against
cabell,
which
dealt
with
arrest
warrants
and
not
with
search
warrants
and
--
which
is
a
little
difficult
to
understand
why
it
was
even
referred
to.
now,
there
is
a
legitimate
concern
with
the
problem
of
intercepting
innocent
conversations
and
conversations
of
innocent
persons
who
may
be
in
the
household
or
who
otherwise
may
be
calling
in
or
out
from
the
intercepted
telephones.
but
i
think
it’s
clear
that
congress
anticipated
that
this
was
inevitable
and
that
indeed,
any
wire
interception
must
necessarily
entail
some
limited
degree
of
interception
of
innocent
persons
or
innocent
conversations.
i’d
like
to
give
some
examples
of
some
typical
conversations
which
i
think
will
make
this
clear.
first
of
all,
we
have
--
the
phone
rings
and,
let’s
say,
mrs.
kahn
picks
up
the
phone
and
says
“hello.”
now,
at
this
point,
the
question
is
should
the
people
monitoring
simply
turn
the
recording
off
right
away
because
it’s
not
irving
kahn.
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
quite
clear
because
the
next
--
and
the
answer
is,
clearly,
no.
they
can’t
turn
it
off
at
that
point
because
the
next
words
may
be
“is
irving
at
home?”
“yes,
i’ll
put
him
right
on
the
phone.”
now,
if
they
can
listen
past
the
hello,
past
the
time
that
minnie
kahn
gets
on
the
phone,
the
next
question
may
be
or
the
next
statement
may
be
“i’d
like
to
bet
$500
on
the
bears.
what’s
the
spread?”
and
she
may
say
“well,
it’s
5
points,
but
you
owe
us
$1,000
and
we
can’t
take
any
more
bets
from
you.”
well,
since
they
have
to
be
allowed
to
hear
this
far
into
the
conversation,
once
this
has
been
monitored,
lawfully
monitored,
there’s
no
policy
either
constitutional
or
statutory
that
could
possibly
be
served
by
saying
“well,
they
heard
it
but
they
can’t
use
it
in
evidence.
they
can’t
use
it
to
prove
the
offense
because
they
didn’t
name
minnie
in
the
order.”
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
think
there’s
no
doubt
of
that
and,
with
the
exception
of
this
court,
every
court
has
held
that
where
the
name
target
as
one
of
the
parties
to
the
conversation,
that
conversation
can
be
intercepted.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
seventh
circuit,
i
beg
your
pardon,
yes.
here,
we
have
two
categories
of
conversations:
the
conversations
between
irving
and
minnie
as
to
which
i
can’t
understand
any
basis
for
excluding
those
so
long
as
they
deal
with
the
illegal
gambling
enterprise.
since
irving
was
named
in
the
order,
he
was
a
person
whose
zone
of
privacy
was
being
lawfully
invaded
pursuant
to
this
warrant.
he
did
conduct
conversations
about
the
gambling
enterprise.
i
could
see
no
basis
for
suppressing
those.
now,
similarly,
with
respect
to
the
conversations
between
minnie
and
third
parties
where
she
was
transmitting
gambling
information
or
taking
bets
in
violation
of
state
law
thereto.
they
were
properly
on
the
phone.
they
properly
heard
these
conversations,
and
they
had
to.
as
you
can
see
from
the
examples
that
i’ve
cited,
i
think
there’s
no
basis
than
in
a
justification,
no
policy
reasons
for
excluding
them.
now,
i
see
my
time
is
running
short.
i
think
that
i’d
just
like
to
make
one
or
two
more
comments
and
then
save
the
balance
of
my
time.
the
court
of
appeals
suggested
that
somehow
the
government
should
have
conducted
a
further
investigation
of
mrs.
kahn
which
they
thought
might
have
disclosed
her
complicity
in
the
illegal
enterprise.
we
suggest,
and
we’ve
argued
this
at
some
length
in
our
brief,
that
this
does
not
serve
mrs.
kahn’s
privacy
interest.
it
does
not
serve
any
privacy
interest
that
the
fourth
amendment
is
designed
to
protect.
since
whether
or
not
the
investigation
disclosed
her
complicity,
the
interception
of
her
conversations
could
still
take
place.
finally,
on
the
standing
point
which
we
also
advert
to
in
the
last
section
of
our
brief,
i’d
simply
like
to
cite
alderman,
footnote
9,
in
justice
white’s
opinion
in
alderman.
there
is
a
discussion
of
the
standing
problem
and
there
is
a
reference
to
the
legislative
history
which
is
at
page
91
of
the
senate
report
1097.
and
it
was
quite
clear
there
that
the
normal
fourth
amendment
constitutional
standing
rule
was
intended
to
be
adopted
in
these
wire
interception
cases
and,
under
that
rule,
we
think
it’s
clear
here
that
any
defect
that
may
have
existed
was
purely
personal
to
minnie
kahn,
and
irving
kahn
should
have
no
standing
to
raise
the
issue.
if
there
are
no
questions
at
this
time,
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
a
few
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
of
course,
i’d
like
to
point
out
that
there’s
no
fifth
amendment
problem
in
this
case
since
there
was
no
compelled
statement
or
testimony
of
any
sort.
secondly,
with
respect
to
the
la
gorga
case,
the
health
club
case
that
counsel
adverted
to,
public
phones,
phones
in
public
places
are
different
from
phones
in
a
private
home.
katz
case
involved
a
public
phone.
there
was,
indeed,
an
amendment
proposed
to
congress
to
this
bill
and
which
was
recommended
by
the
justice
department
but
which
was
never
voted
on
or
adopted
which,
in
the
case
of
public
phones,
would’ve
permitted
only
the
interception
of
conversations
of
the
named
party.
for
obvious
reasons,
you
would
have
no
basis
for
expecting
to
receive
any
information
relating
to
your
investigation
from
conversations
on
a
public
phone
except
by
those
of
the
named
party.
that
is
not
at
all
true
in
this
situation
where
you’re
intercepting
conversations
over
a
private
phone.
frequently,
in
these
cases,
there
are
organized
crime
cases;
you’re
dealing
with
sophisticated
conspiracies.
it’s
not
uncommon
particularly
in
narcotics
cases
to
have
two
quite
innocent
people
start
a
conversation
and
then,
in
the
middle
of
the
conversation,
all
of
a
sudden
you
have
two
completely
different
people
who
are
on
the
phone
talking
in
code
about
narcotics
transactions.
in
this
case,
indeed,
some
of
the
conversations
were
in
yiddish
between
irving
and
minnie
kahn.
with
respect
to
what’s
in
the
record
and
what
isn’t
in
the
record
that
is
a
little
confusing.
the
record
in
the
wire
interception
authorization
proceeding,
which
is
technically
a
civil
proceeding,
was
sealed
and
it
did
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
technically,
the
tapes
of
the
recordings
were
part
of
the
record.
in
fact,
i
think
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
listened
to
any
of
the
conversations
or
relied
upon
the
content
of
any
of
the
conversations,
the
specific
content,
in
reaching
its
decisions.
now,
the
notice
issue
which
counsel
discussed
is,
of
course,
not
before
this
court
or
was
not
involved
in
the
grant
of
certiorari.
moreover,
it’s
clear
that
the
district
court
has
discretion
to
require
notice,
service
of
the
inventory
notice,
except
to
the
named
party.
here,
the
named
party
was
irving
kahn.
he
received
service
of
the
notice.
there
was
no
defect
in
that
regard.
and
finally,
with
respect
to
the
standing
point,
it
is
true
that
the
statute
defines
a
person
aggrieved
quite
broadly
for
standing
purposes.
but
we’ve
indicated
in
our
brief
our
position,
we
think
this
is
supported
by
the
discussion
in
alderman,
that
the
target
of
the
interception,
the
person
whose
phone
is
being
intercepted
is
conferred
broad
standing
for
the
purpose
of
challenging
the
legality
of
the
entry
onto
his
telephone
line
just
as
the
home
owner
is
conferred
broad
standing
for
the
purpose
of
challenging
the
entry
into
his
house.
if
something
illegal
inside
his
house
or
on
the
line
is
found
but
only
affects
another
person,
he
should
not
be
granted
standing
to
challenge
it.
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
