justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
the
government’s
position
to
be
that
they
knew
mrs.
kahn
was
there.
they
were
aware
that
there
was
a
mrs.
kahn,
but
they
were
not
aware
that
she
was
in
this
syndicate.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
what’s
wrong
with
that
position?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
you
saying
that
the
order
would
have
to
include
the
wife
and
all
of
the
children?
so
if
there
was
a
family
with
16
children,
it
would
have
to
include
all
of
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know,
probably
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
the
word
“unknown,”
sure
she’s
known.
anybody
could
know
all
that
just
by
picking
up
a
telephone
book.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
government
assumed
that
what
she’d
be
talking
over
the
phone
would
be
ordering
food,
and
she
doesn’t
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
all
along,
they
found
out
it
was
unknown.
but
they
didn’t
know
that
when
they
had
gotten
this
indictment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean
the
--
i
meant
the
search
warrant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
thought
that
the
order
said
that.
the
order
said
you
should
not
listen
to
other
matters.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
when
the
order
was
issued,
she
wasn’t
affected
at
all,
was
she?
unless
--

unless
she
was
in

conspiracy.
