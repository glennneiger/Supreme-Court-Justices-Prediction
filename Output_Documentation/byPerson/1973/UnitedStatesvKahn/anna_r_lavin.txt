ms.
anna
r.
lavin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don’t
know
that
i
entirely
understood
the
latter
part
of
counsel’s
argument
relative
to
standing.
the
statute
itself
provides
standing
for
any
person
aggrieved.
and
i
think
that
is
conclusive
on
who
has
standing.
along
with
that,
i
would
like
to
contest
partly
what
the
government
has
stated
that
this
title
iii
case
does
not
involve.
it
does
here,
contrary
to
what
he
said,
have
a
minimization
issue.
that
was
not
ruled
on
in
the
court
below
as
not
necessary,
perhaps
it
was
somewhat
ruled
upon
by
virtue
of
this
case.
the
sufficiency
of
the
affidavit
and
the
application
are
not
finally
settled.
it
also
has
an
issue
of
proper
or
improper
authorization.
in
that
regard,
the
government
indicated
that
we
have
all
the
normal
papers.
we
have
got
none
of
the
affidavits
to
determine
if
this
was
one
of
the
so-called
now
lindenbaum
cases.
this
case
was
decided
in
the
district
court
in
november
of
1971.
the
leading
robinson
case
referring
to
the
lindenbaum
case
affidavits
was
some
six
months
later.
so,
those
are
battles
that
we
have
yet
to
fight
and
i
make
reference
to
this
only
because
the
government
has
indicated
that
we
got
all
the
customary
papers.
again,
and
this
might
have
been
a
misstatement,
he
said
that
the
indictment
had
been
dismissed.
on
the
contrary,
that
evidence
has
been
suppressed
but
the
indictment
continues
to
be
viable.
the
trial
court
merely
suppressed
the
evidence
that
minnie
kahn
had
on
her
about
march
21,
1970
and,
particularly
some
conversations
she
had
with
irving
kahn
on
that
date.
he
was
in
arizona.
she
was
in
skokie,
illinois.
this
was
at
the
trial
court
level,
suppressed
principally
upon
the
husband
and
wife
privilege.
secondly,
it
was
suppressed
on
the
ground
that
minnie,
though
a
known
person,
was
not
named
in
the
authorization
order.
particularly,
the
trial
court
found,
and
this
is
at
page
52
of
the
appendix
in
the
court
of
appeals.
any
conversations
exclusively
between
the
defendant
irving
kahn
and
his
wife
minnie
kahn
a
privilege
of
communications
and,
thereby,
suppressed.
the
motion
of
the
defendant
minnie
kahn
to
suppress
her
intercepted
conversations
is
granted
as
they
were
not
authorized
by
judge
campbell’s
order.
the
motion
the
defendant
irving
kahn
to
suppress
intercepted
conversations
to
or
from
his
home
is
also
granted
to
the
extent
that
he
did
not
personally
participate
in
such
conversations.
now,
these
three
are
the
basis
of
the
government’s
appeal
from
the
trial
court.
now,
we
would
refer
the
court
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
there,
we
had
three
separate
decisions.
the
majority
holding
that
the
non-irving
communications
were
not
authorized.
one
judge
agreed
with
the
trial
court
that
the
minnie-irving
conversations
were
privileged
and
recognized
as
such
by
the
statute
as
privileged
and
should’ve
been
excluded.
neither
the
tapes
nor
the
report
that
was
delivered
to
the
trial
court
was
any
part
of
this
record,
i
meant
to
the
authorizing
court,
was
any
part
of
the
record
at
the
trial
court
level
nor
at
the
court
of
appeals
level.
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
yesterday
about
that.
the
answer
to
your
question
is
the
report
about
which
you
asked
was
filed
in
this
court
for
the
first
time.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
even
suggest
the
content
of
the
marital
conversations.
now,
in
this
posture
and
with
due
recognition
that
this
is,
i
believe,
the
first
title
iii
case
before
this
court,
we
have
the
further
recognition
that
will
be
followed
by
more
sophisticated
arguments
on
title
iii.
we
do
see
in
this
case
a
basic
constitutional
issue.
if,
as
the
government
urges,
we
were
to
equate
title
iii
conversations
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
the
fourth
amendment,
this
court
has
to
decide
whether
a
conversation
is
the
equivalent
of
a
place
to
be
searched
or
whether
those
conversations
are
an
incident
or
an
element
of
the
person.
the
government’s
argument
tends
to
ask
you
to
equate
a
telephone
with
the
premises
to
be
searched.
we
submit,
on
the
other
hand,
that
a
telephone
conversation
is
the
property
of
the
person,
not
of
the
phone,
of
the
person
whose
thoughts,
whose
ideas,
whose
reactions
are
reflected
by
that
conversation.
we
submit
that
a
telephone
is
not
a
premises.
it’s
not
an
enclave.
it’s
not
a
cartilage.
the
phone
retains
no
property.
it’s
only
the
wiretap
that
retains
the
personal
utterances.
in
that
respect,
we
think
there’s
also
a
quality
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
this
case
because
the
goal
of
the
wiretap
is
the
securing
of
incriminating
statements
of
persons
names
in
the
order.
they
don’t
listen
for
innocent
conversations
and
accidentally
come
across
evidence
or
instrumentalities
of
crime.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
not
admissible.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
our
position
is
that
this
would
take
us,
of
course,
to
the
application
and
to
the
affidavit
which
we
reach
later.
and
that
is
that
mr.
kahn,
at
the
time
of
this
conversation,
was
off
the
premises.
now,
let
us
assume
he’s
on
the
premises
and
someone
else
takes
over
the
phone,
and
enough
is
heard
accidentally
in
that
case
to
determine
that
someone
else
is
now
involved
with
him
in
the
gambling
operation.
but
under
the
circumstances
in
this
case
where
he
was
not
on
the
premises,
then
the
information
secured
would
not
be
admissible
because
it
had
not
been
pursuant
to
the
order
nor
had
it
been
--
nor
had
any
order
been
obtained
on
probable
cause.
but
we
have
to
look
at
that
in
the
posture
of
this
case.
the
la
gorga
case
that
the
government
adverts
to
is,
i
think,
fairly
applicable
here.
in
that
case,
two
of
the
principals
were
known
to
visit
a
certain
health
club.
an
order
issued
and
it
said
you
may
listen
in
on
the
phone
at
the
health
club,
but
you
may
only
listen
when
one
or
both
of
the
known
persons
are
on
the
premises
and
when
one
or
the
other
of
the
known
person
is
involved
in
the
conversation.
in
other
words,
i
think
the
important
distinction
here
is
mr.
kahn’s
being
off
the
premises.
if
i
may
just
finish
up
the
thought,
i
suggest
that
this
is
an
invasion
of
the
person,
i
would
also
suggest
that
congress
understood
this
to
be
an
invasion
of
the
person
when
it
specifically
excluded
any
privileged
conversations.
now,
of
course,
privileged
conversations
do
not
refer
to
premises.
they
refer
only
to
people.
now,
i
would
like
to
go,
if
the
court
please,
to
persons
unknown
and
whether
minnie
kahn
can
be
brought
within
the
shelter
of
persons
unknown.
i
want
to
refer
you
first,
if
i
may,
to
the
affidavit
which
is
found
at
page
9
of
the
appendix
before
this
court.
at
3
(a),
they
state
this.
“there
is
probable
cause
for
a
belief
that
irving
kahn
and
jake
jacobs
have
been
and
are
now
committing
an
offense
involving
the
use
of
telephone
communication
facilities
in
interstate
commerce
with
intent
to
carry
on
the
offensive
waitering
(ph)
on
sports
events
in
violation
of
illinois
law.”
then
on
the
next
page,
the
affidavit
says,
“there’s
probable
cause
to
believe
the
telephone
numbers
and
the
numbers
at
the
kahn
residence
and
telephone
numbers
at
the
jacob’s
residence
are
being
used
and
will
be
used
in
carrying
out
the
offenses
of
paragraph
3
(a)",
which
i
just
read.
the
affidavit
continues,
in
effect,
finding
how
this
operation
is
run
by
kahn
and
how
it
is
run
by
jacobs.
no
one
else
is
adverted
to
as
being
a
part
of
this
operation.
the
only
persons
who
are
referred
to
thereafter
are
bettors
and
linesman.
i
don’t
mean
linesman
in
the
sense
of
football.
so
eventually,
without
another
word
being
said
about
parties
unknown,
we
come
to
the
last
paragraph
on
page
20
where
the
request
is
made.
it
is
requested,
this
intercept
not
terminate
etcetera,
to
reveal
the
manner
in
which
irving
kahn,
jake
jacobs,
and
others
yet
unknown
participate
in
the
illegal
use
of
interstate
telephone
facilities.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that,
sir,
is
from
page
20.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
down
at
the
--
starting
at
the
bottom
of
19
onto
20.
the
only
persons
who
could
fit
into
that
description,
i
submit,
are
the
bettors
and
the
linesman
who
were
adverted
to
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
affidavit.
now,
i
think
the
government
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
nobody
is
mentioned
in
the
entire
affidavit
from
the
kahn
house.
the
only
persons
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
mr.
kahn,
yes,
he’s
mentioned.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that’s
right.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that’s
right.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
calling
in,
that’s
right.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
the
bettors.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
oh!
no,
i
do
not.
no,
i
certainly
don’t
mean
if
his
confederates
in
the
conspiracy
called
in
that
they
would
be
excluded,
but
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
and
i
say
if
he’s
on
the
premises
and
they
pick
up
a
call
of
that
nature,
that
is
a
--
shows
itself
to
be
a
part
of
this
conspiracy,
that
would
be
permissible.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
not
mrs.
kahn
on
the
posture
of
this
case.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
well,
i
think
we
can
do
that
from
the
record
knowing,
of
course,
and
starting
with
the
predicate
that
not
one
word
was
said
about
mrs.
kahn
in
any
of
the
affidavits.
the
government
recognized
in
its
argument
the
elimination
of
mrs.
kahn
from
any
probable
cause.
it
then
argues
in
this
fashion,
and
this
is
at
page
26
of
its
brief
in
chief.
since
mr.
kahn
could
hardly
be
assumed
to
be
invariably
at
home
and
available,
someone
would
be
expecting
on
occasion
to
receive
calls
relating
to
the
business
on
his
telephones.
but
that
is
belied
by
the
appendix
which
states
at
page
11,
first
paragraph,
“kahn’s
bettors
contact
either
kahn
or
jacobs
and
place
their
bets.
when
kahn
is
out
of
town
and/or
vacationing,
all
bettors
with
call
jacobs,
and
vice
versa.”
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that
is
the
government’s
position
and
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
well,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
it
does
not
satisfy
the
statute.
that
it’s
a
contortion
or
a
distortion
of
the
words
on
the
requirements
for
the
securing
of
an
order.
the
statute
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
no,
sir,
but
by
exclusion
it’s
indicated
that
there’s
no
probable
grounds
or
probable
cause
to
listen
into
their
private
conversations.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
well,
your
honor,
the
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
and
the
argument
of
the
government
is
the
identity
of
the
person,
if
known,
whose
communications
are
to
be
intercepted
as
the
statute
reads.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
when
they
got
the
order,
they
did
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
but
should
they
have
been
listening
to
her
ordering
meat,
i
submit
that
they
should
not
have
and
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that’s
right.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that’s
right,
she
wasn’t.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
it
appears
that
she
was
handling
some
gambling
business.
that’s
right,
but
they
had
no
basis
for
listening
to
her.
the
government
argues
that
this
should
be
excused.
i
submit
that
it
should
not.
but
they
say
it
should
be
excuse
because
they
can
get
one
of
these
orders
without
naming
anybody.
well,
that
means
that
they
don’t
know
anybody
to
name.
i
think
the
wording
of
the
five
requirements
is
beyond
question.
you
can’t
say
“the
name
of
the
person,
if
known.”
they
don’t
say
“the
name
of
the
person,
if
known,
could
be
in
the
gambling
business.”
they
say
“the
name
of
the
person,
if
known,”
and
i
suggest
that
it’s
a
distortion
of
the
plain
words
of
the
statute
to
amend
it
to
say
“you
have
to
name
the
person
if
you
know.
only,
you
don’t
have
to
name
him
if
you
don’t
know
if
he’s
in
the
business.”
the
requirements
of
that
statute,
both
the
name
of
the
person,
if
known,
and
the
four
other
requirements
are
mandatory
conditions.
they
are
set
forth
in
the
statute,
we
think,
to
meet
the
precision
and
discrimination
discussed
by
this
court
in
katz,
where
this
court
said
that,
under
sufficiently
precise
and
discriminate
circumstances,
a
federal
court
may
empower
government
agents
to
employ
a
concealed
electronic
device
for
the
narrow
and
particularized
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
truth
of
the
allegations
of
a
detailed
factual
affidavit
alleging
the
commission
of
a
particular
offense.
if
any
of
those
requirements
are
omitted,
the
warrant
itself
loses,
or
rather
the
order
itself
loses
precision
and
the
discrimination
that
is
required
by
this
court
under
katz.
also,
you
don’t
have
the
other
requirement
of
katz,
the
narrow
and
particularized
purpose,
nor
are
you
looking
here
for
the
truth
of
the
allegations
as
to
whether
or
not
katz
is
running
a
betting
operation
on
his
premises.
this
listening
indiscriminately
to
the
conversations
of
the
children
and
of
the
wife
would
not
lead
to
the
end
that
is
indicated
as
the
purpose
under
the
katz
case.
the
government,
in
its
argument,
in
its
brief
--
both
the
brief
and
in
its
argument
here,
relies
in
great
measure
on
the
“plain
view”
doctrine
that
this
court
discussed
in
the
coolidge
case.
as
that
court
found
--
as
this
court
found
in
that
case,
it
said
that
the
doctrine
was
not
applicable
to
a
search
of
a
particular
pontiac
automobile
which
stood
plainly
in
the
driveway.
we
suggest
that
should
also
apply
here
where
the
search
centered
on
minnie
kahn,
and
minnie
kahn
and
their
two
children
were
known
occupants
of
the
premises.
in
coolidge,
you
said
the
“plain
view”
doctrine
may
not
be
used
to
extend
the
general
exploratory
search
from
one
object
to
another
until
something
incriminating
at
last
emerges.
well,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
if
you
can’t
extend
from
one
object
to
another,
then
we
don’t
think
you
can
extend
from
irving
kahn
to
minnie
kahn.
i
also
would
take
up
with
the
court
the
matter
of
notice.
in
our
fourth
point
in
our
brief,
we
complained
about
the
secrecy
of
these
court-authorized
interception
proceedings.
most
particularly,
we
complained
about
having
no
access
to
files
to
determine
in
this
case
whether
a
notice
in
inventory
was
served
on
minnie
kahn
which
we
think
would’ve
been
a
recognition
that
minnie
kahn
was
within
the
scope
of
the
authorizing
letter.
the
government
says
that
minnie
wasn’t
mentioned
in
the
order
and,
therefore,
notice
in
inventory
need
only
be
served
upon
her
in
the
court’s
discretion.
we
take
that,
of
course,
to
admit
that
minnie
didn’t
in
fact
get
any
notice
even
though
it
was
her
conversations
principally,
not
irving’s,
on
that
phone
that
the
government
intends
to
use
to
prove
the
case
here.
and
even
thought
the
government
ask
this
court
to
unsuppress
that
evidence,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
kind
of
a
“later
day”
explanation
that
a
known
person,
though
not
known
to
be
in
a
gambling
business,
was
definitely
to
a
person
to
whom
this
notice
was
required.
the
government
excuses
this
in
a
way.
it
says
minnie
kahn
received
a
notice
sent
to
irving.
now,
that’s
a
little
off
the
record,
but
i’m
willing
to
assume
the
validity
of
that
representation.
all
the
cases
of
which
we
are
aware
indicate
that
this
notice
is
made
by
a
registered
mail
and,
for
the
purpose
of
this
we
will
assume
that
minnie
received
the
mail.
but
the
government
asks
the
court
further
to
assume,
first,
that
minnie
opened
the
mail
or
that
irving
is
presumed
to
have
told
minnie
what
was
in
the
letter
from
the
government.
i
think
that’s
untenable
that
while
wives
do
not
invariably
open
husband’s
mail
and
husbands
do
not
tell
wives
they’re
having
trouble
with
the
government
until
they’re
forced
to
do
it.
the
ianella
case
on
which
the
government
relies
has
no
force
here.
in
that
case,
the
other
persons
were
actually
unknown
persons,
unknown
at
the
time
they
put
in
the
wiretap.
this
person
using
the
phone
to
the
exclusion
of
the
named
person.
we
would
then
refer
the
court
to
the
third
circuit
eastman
case
at
465
f.
2d.
there,
a
suppression
order
issued
and
it
was
affirmed
for
failure
to
give
the
statutory
notice.
in
that
case,
they
relied
principally
in
this
court’s
decision
in
berger
which
cast
down
a
new
york
eavesdropping
statute
for
failure
to
provide
for
the
giving
of
notice.
in
this
case,
though
the
bulk
of
the
conversations
were
minnie’s,
the
government
would
have
us
read
this
statute
that
notice
need
not
be
given
to
minnie
from
whom
the
property
was
taken.
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
does
not
equate
with
the
fourth
amendment
even
if
it
does
equate
with
the
literal
reading
of
2518
(8)
(d).
if
that
section
can
be
so
narrowly
construed,
like
a
person
from
whom
the
telephone
calls
were
taken
need
not
be
given
notice,
then
it
doesn’t
meet
the
requirements
of
this
court’s
decision
in
berger
and,
under
such
a
construction,
we
would
submit
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
i
see
that
my
time
is
going
and
i
would
just
like
to
refer
the
court
to
the
government
cited
case,
the
united
states
versus
la
gorga
at
365
f.
2d
or
rather
f.
7h.
it
gives
us
a
background
against
which
the
legislature
intended
title
iii
to
be
considered.
and
in
speaking
of
the
privacy
insured
by
the
fourth
amendment,
it
said
that
privacy
can
be
breached
by
a
search
warrant
under
conditions
set
out
in
the
amendment.
factually,
the
wiretapping
permitted
by
the
omnibus
crime
control
act
is
severely
limited
and
the
act
actually
prohibits
far
more
wiretapping
than
it
permits.
i
submit
then
to
the
court,
in
closing,
that
wiretapping
and
any
expansion
on
the
order
should
be
given
a
negative
rather
than
a
positive
reception
and
should
be
countenanced
only
in
circumstances
that
clearly
warranted,
and
this
is
not
such
a
case.
we
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
don’t
know
that
i
entirely
understood
the
latter
part
of
counsel’s
argument
relative
to
standing.
the
statute
itself
provides
standing
for
any
person
aggrieved.
and
i
think
that
is
conclusive
on
who
has
standing.
along
with
that,
i
would
like
to
contest
partly
what
the
government
has
stated
that
this
title
iii
case
does
not
involve.
it
does
here,
contrary
to
what
he
said,
have
a
minimization
issue.
that
was
not
ruled
on
in
the
court
below
as
not
necessary,
perhaps
it
was
somewhat
ruled
upon
by
virtue
of
this
case.
the
sufficiency
of
the
affidavit
and
the
application
are
not
finally
settled.
it
also
has
an
issue
of
proper
or
improper
authorization.
in
that
regard,
the
government
indicated
that
we
have
all
the
normal
papers.
we
have
got
none
of
the
affidavits
to
determine
if
this
was
one
of
the
so-called
now
lindenbaum
cases.
this
case
was
decided
in
the
district
court
in
november
of
1971.
the
leading
robinson
case
referring
to
the
lindenbaum
case
affidavits
was
some
six
months
later.
so,
those
are
battles
that
we
have
yet
to
fight
and
i
make
reference
to
this
only
because
the
government
has
indicated
that
we
got
all
the
customary
papers.
again,
and
this
might
have
been
a
misstatement,
he
said
that
the
indictment
had
been
dismissed.
on
the
contrary,
that
evidence
has
been
suppressed
but
the
indictment
continues
to
be
viable.
the
trial
court
merely
suppressed
the
evidence
that
minnie
kahn
had
on
her
about
march
21,
1970
and,
particularly
some
conversations
she
had
with
irving
kahn
on
that
date.
he
was
in
arizona.
she
was
in
skokie,
illinois.
this
was
at
the
trial
court
level,
suppressed
principally
upon
the
husband
and
wife
privilege.
secondly,
it
was
suppressed
on
the
ground
that
minnie,
though
a
known
person,
was
not
named
in
the
authorization
order.
particularly,
the
trial
court
found,
and
this
is
at
page
52
of
the
appendix
in
the
court
of
appeals.
any
conversations
exclusively
between
the
defendant
irving
kahn
and
his
wife
minnie
kahn
a
privilege
of
communications
and,
thereby,
suppressed.
the
motion
of
the
defendant
minnie
kahn
to
suppress
her
intercepted
conversations
is
granted
as
they
were
not
authorized
by
judge
campbell’s
order.
the
motion
the
defendant
irving
kahn
to
suppress
intercepted
conversations
to
or
from
his
home
is
also
granted
to
the
extent
that
he
did
not
personally
participate
in
such
conversations.
now,
these
three
are
the
basis
of
the
government’s
appeal
from
the
trial
court.
now,
we
would
refer
the
court
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
there,
we
had
three
separate
decisions.
the
majority
holding
that
the
non-irving
communications
were
not
authorized.
one
judge
agreed
with
the
trial
court
that
the
minnie-irving
conversations
were
privileged
and
recognized
as
such
by
the
statute
as
privileged
and
should’ve
been
excluded.
neither
the
tapes
nor
the
report
that
was
delivered
to
the
trial
court
was
any
part
of
this
record,
i
meant
to
the
authorizing
court,
was
any
part
of
the
record
at
the
trial
court
level
nor
at
the
court
of
appeals
level.
mr.
justice
stewart
asked
yesterday
about
that.
the
answer
to
your
question
is
the
report
about
which
you
asked
was
filed
in
this
court
for
the
first
time.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
even
suggest
the
content
of
the
marital
conversations.
now,
in
this
posture
and
with
due
recognition
that
this
is,
i
believe,
the
first
title
iii
case
before
this
court,
we
have
the
further
recognition
that
will
be
followed
by
more
sophisticated
arguments
on
title
iii.
we
do
see
in
this
case
a
basic
constitutional
issue.
if,
as
the
government
urges,
we
were
to
equate
title
iii
conversations
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
--
the
fourth
amendment,
this
court
has
to
decide
whether
a
conversation
is
the
equivalent
of
a
place
to
be
searched
or
whether
those
conversations
are
an
incident
or
an
element
of
the
person.
the
government’s
argument
tends
to
ask
you
to
equate
a
telephone
with
the
premises
to
be
searched.
we
submit,
on
the
other
hand,
that
a
telephone
conversation
is
the
property
of
the
person,
not
of
the
phone,
of
the
person
whose
thoughts,
whose
ideas,
whose
reactions
are
reflected
by
that
conversation.
we
submit
that
a
telephone
is
not
a
premises.
it’s
not
an
enclave.
it’s
not
a
cartilage.
the
phone
retains
no
property.
it’s
only
the
wiretap
that
retains
the
personal
utterances.
in
that
respect,
we
think
there’s
also
a
quality
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
this
case
because
the
goal
of
the
wiretap
is
the
securing
of
incriminating
statements
of
persons
names
in
the
order.
they
don’t
listen
for
innocent
conversations
and
accidentally
come
across
evidence
or
instrumentalities
of
crime.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
not
admissible.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
our
position
is
that
this
would
take
us,
of
course,
to
the
application
and
to
the
affidavit
which
we
reach
later.
and
that
is
that
mr.
kahn,
at
the
time
of
this
conversation,
was
off
the
premises.
now,
let
us
assume
he’s
on
the
premises
and
someone
else
takes
over
the
phone,
and
enough
is
heard
accidentally
in
that
case
to
determine
that
someone
else
is
now
involved
with
him
in
the
gambling
operation.
but
under
the
circumstances
in
this
case
where
he
was
not
on
the
premises,
then
the
information
secured
would
not
be
admissible
because
it
had
not
been
pursuant
to
the
order
nor
had
it
been
--
nor
had
any
order
been
obtained
on
probable
cause.
but
we
have
to
look
at
that
in
the
posture
of
this
case.
the
la
gorga
case
that
the
government
adverts
to
is,
i
think,
fairly
applicable
here.
in
that
case,
two
of
the
principals
were
known
to
visit
a
certain
health
club.
an
order
issued
and
it
said
you
may
listen
in
on
the
phone
at
the
health
club,
but
you
may
only
listen
when
one
or
both
of
the
known
persons
are
on
the
premises
and
when
one
or
the
other
of
the
known
person
is
involved
in
the
conversation.
in
other
words,
i
think
the
important
distinction
here
is
mr.
kahn’s
being
off
the
premises.
if
i
may
just
finish
up
the
thought,
i
suggest
that
this
is
an
invasion
of
the
person,
i
would
also
suggest
that
congress
understood
this
to
be
an
invasion
of
the
person
when
it
specifically
excluded
any
privileged
conversations.
now,
of
course,
privileged
conversations
do
not
refer
to
premises.
they
refer
only
to
people.
now,
i
would
like
to
go,
if
the
court
please,
to
persons
unknown
and
whether
minnie
kahn
can
be
brought
within
the
shelter
of
persons
unknown.
i
want
to
refer
you
first,
if
i
may,
to
the
affidavit
which
is
found
at
page
9
of
the
appendix
before
this
court.
at
3
(a),
they
state
this.
“there
is
probable
cause
for
a
belief
that
irving
kahn
and
jake
jacobs
have
been
and
are
now
committing
an
offense
involving
the
use
of
telephone
communication
facilities
in
interstate
commerce
with
intent
to
carry
on
the
offensive
waitering
(ph)
on
sports
events
in
violation
of
illinois
law.”
then
on
the
next
page,
the
affidavit
says,
“there’s
probable
cause
to
believe
the
telephone
numbers
and
the
numbers
at
the
kahn
residence
and
telephone
numbers
at
the
jacob’s
residence
are
being
used
and
will
be
used
in
carrying
out
the
offenses
of
paragraph
3
(a)",
which
i
just
read.
the
affidavit
continues,
in
effect,
finding
how
this
operation
is
run
by
kahn
and
how
it
is
run
by
jacobs.
no
one
else
is
adverted
to
as
being
a
part
of
this
operation.
the
only
persons
who
are
referred
to
thereafter
are
bettors
and
linesman.
i
don’t
mean
linesman
in
the
sense
of
football.
so
eventually,
without
another
word
being
said
about
parties
unknown,
we
come
to
the
last
paragraph
on
page
20
where
the
request
is
made.
it
is
requested,
this
intercept
not
terminate
etcetera,
to
reveal
the
manner
in
which
irving
kahn,
jake
jacobs,
and
others
yet
unknown
participate
in
the
illegal
use
of
interstate
telephone
facilities.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that,
sir,
is
from
page
20.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
down
at
the
--
starting
at
the
bottom
of
19
onto
20.
the
only
persons
who
could
fit
into
that
description,
i
submit,
are
the
bettors
and
the
linesman
who
were
adverted
to
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
affidavit.
now,
i
think
the
government
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
nobody
is
mentioned
in
the
entire
affidavit
from
the
kahn
house.
the
only
persons
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
mr.
kahn,
yes,
he’s
mentioned.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that’s
right.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that’s
right.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
calling
in,
that’s
right.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
the
bettors.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
oh!
no,
i
do
not.
no,
i
certainly
don’t
mean
if
his
confederates
in
the
conspiracy
called
in
that
they
would
be
excluded,
but
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
and
i
say
if
he’s
on
the
premises
and
they
pick
up
a
call
of
that
nature,
that
is
a
--
shows
itself
to
be
a
part
of
this
conspiracy,
that
would
be
permissible.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes,
sir.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
not
mrs.
kahn
on
the
posture
of
this
case.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
well,
i
think
we
can
do
that
from
the
record
knowing,
of
course,
and
starting
with
the
predicate
that
not
one
word
was
said
about
mrs.
kahn
in
any
of
the
affidavits.
the
government
recognized
in
its
argument
the
elimination
of
mrs.
kahn
from
any
probable
cause.
it
then
argues
in
this
fashion,
and
this
is
at
page
26
of
its
brief
in
chief.
since
mr.
kahn
could
hardly
be
assumed
to
be
invariably
at
home
and
available,
someone
would
be
expecting
on
occasion
to
receive
calls
relating
to
the
business
on
his
telephones.
but
that
is
belied
by
the
appendix
which
states
at
page
11,
first
paragraph,
“kahn’s
bettors
contact
either
kahn
or
jacobs
and
place
their
bets.
when
kahn
is
out
of
town
and/or
vacationing,
all
bettors
with
call
jacobs,
and
vice
versa.”
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that
is
the
government’s
position
and
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
well,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
it
does
not
satisfy
the
statute.
that
it’s
a
contortion
or
a
distortion
of
the
words
on
the
requirements
for
the
securing
of
an
order.
the
statute
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
no,
sir,
but
by
exclusion
it’s
indicated
that
there’s
no
probable
grounds
or
probable
cause
to
listen
into
their
private
conversations.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
well,
your
honor,
the
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
and
the
argument
of
the
government
is
the
identity
of
the
person,
if
known,
whose
communications
are
to
be
intercepted
as
the
statute
reads.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
yes.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
when
they
got
the
order,
they
did
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
but
should
they
have
been
listening
to
her
ordering
meat,
i
submit
that
they
should
not
have
and
--
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that’s
right.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
that’s
right,
she
wasn’t.
ms.
anna
r.
lavin
it
appears
that
she
was
handling
some
gambling
business.
that’s
right,
but
they
had
no
basis
for
listening
to
her.
the
government
argues
that
this
should
be
excused.
i
submit
that
it
should
not.
but
they
say
it
should
be
excuse
because
they
can
get
one
of
these
orders
without
naming
anybody.
well,
that
means
that
they
don’t
know
anybody
to
name.
i
think
the
wording
of
the
five
requirements
is
beyond
question.
you
can’t
say
“the
name
of
the
person,
if
known.”
they
don’t
say
“the
name
of
the
person,
if
known,
could
be
in
the
gambling
business.”
they
say
“the
name
of
the
person,
if
known,”
and
i
suggest
that
it’s
a
distortion
of
the
plain
words
of
the
statute
to
amend
it
to
say
“you
have
to
name
the
person
if
you
know.
only,
you
don’t
have
to
name
him
if
you
don’t
know
if
he’s
in
the
business.”
the
requirements
of
that
statute,
both
the
name
of
the
person,
if
known,
and
the
four
other
requirements
are
mandatory
conditions.
they
are
set
forth
in
the
statute,
we
think,
to
meet
the
precision
and
discrimination
discussed
by
this
court
in
katz,
where
this
court
said
that,
under
sufficiently
precise
and
discriminate
circumstances,
a
federal
court
may
empower
government
agents
to
employ
a
concealed
electronic
device
for
the
narrow
and
particularized
purpose
of
ascertaining
the
truth
of
the
allegations
of
a
detailed
factual
affidavit
alleging
the
commission
of
a
particular
offense.
if
any
of
those
requirements
are
omitted,
the
warrant
itself
loses,
or
rather
the
order
itself
loses
precision
and
the
discrimination
that
is
required
by
this
court
under
katz.
also,
you
don’t
have
the
other
requirement
of
katz,
the
narrow
and
particularized
purpose,
nor
are
you
looking
here
for
the
truth
of
the
allegations
as
to
whether
or
not
katz
is
running
a
betting
operation
on
his
premises.
this
listening
indiscriminately
to
the
conversations
of
the
children
and
of
the
wife
would
not
lead
to
the
end
that
is
indicated
as
the
purpose
under
the
katz
case.
the
government,
in
its
argument,
in
its
brief
--
both
the
brief
and
in
its
argument
here,
relies
in
great
measure
on
the
“plain
view”
doctrine
that
this
court
discussed
in
the
coolidge
case.
as
that
court
found
--
as
this
court
found
in
that
case,
it
said
that
the
doctrine
was
not
applicable
to
a
search
of
a
particular
pontiac
automobile
which
stood
plainly
in
the
driveway.
we
suggest
that
should
also
apply
here
where
the
search
centered
on
minnie
kahn,
and
minnie
kahn
and
their
two
children
were
known
occupants
of
the
premises.
in
coolidge,
you
said
the
“plain
view”
doctrine
may
not
be
used
to
extend
the
general
exploratory
search
from
one
object
to
another
until
something
incriminating
at
last
emerges.
well,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
if
you
can’t
extend
from
one
object
to
another,
then
we
don’t
think
you
can
extend
from
irving
kahn
to
minnie
kahn.
i
also
would
take
up
with
the
court
the
matter
of
notice.
in
our
fourth
point
in
our
brief,
we
complained
about
the
secrecy
of
these
court-authorized
interception
proceedings.
most
particularly,
we
complained
about
having
no
access
to
files
to
determine
in
this
case
whether
a
notice
in
inventory
was
served
on
minnie
kahn
which
we
think
would’ve
been
a
recognition
that
minnie
kahn
was
within
the
scope
of
the
authorizing
letter.
the
government
says
that
minnie
wasn’t
mentioned
in
the
order
and,
therefore,
notice
in
inventory
need
only
be
served
upon
her
in
the
court’s
discretion.
we
take
that,
of
course,
to
admit
that
minnie
didn’t
in
fact
get
any
notice
even
though
it
was
her
conversations
principally,
not
irving’s,
on
that
phone
that
the
government
intends
to
use
to
prove
the
case
here.
and
even
thought
the
government
ask
this
court
to
unsuppress
that
evidence,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
is
kind
of
a
“later
day”
explanation
that
a
known
person,
though
not
known
to
be
in
a
gambling
business,
was
definitely
to
a
person
to
whom
this
notice
was
required.
the
government
excuses
this
in
a
way.
it
says
minnie
kahn
received
a
notice
sent
to
irving.
now,
that’s
a
little
off
the
record,
but
i’m
willing
to
assume
the
validity
of
that
representation.
all
the
cases
of
which
we
are
aware
indicate
that
this
notice
is
made
by
a
registered
mail
and,
for
the
purpose
of
this
we
will
assume
that
minnie
received
the
mail.
but
the
government
asks
the
court
further
to
assume,
first,
that
minnie
opened
the
mail
or
that
irving
is
presumed
to
have
told
minnie
what
was
in
the
letter
from
the
government.
i
think
that’s
untenable
that
while
wives
do
not
invariably
open
husband’s
mail
and
husbands
do
not
tell
wives
they’re
having
trouble
with
the
government
until
they’re
forced
to
do
it.
the
ianella
case
on
which
the
government
relies
has
no
force
here.
in
that
case,
the
other
persons
were
actually
unknown
persons,
unknown
at
the
time
they
put
in
the
wiretap.
this
person
using
the
phone
to
the
exclusion
of
the
named
person.
we
would
then
refer
the
court
to
the
third
circuit
eastman
case
at
465
f.
2d.
there,
a
suppression
order
issued
and
it
was
affirmed
for
failure
to
give
the
statutory
notice.
in
that
case,
they
relied
principally
in
this
court’s
decision
in
berger
which
cast
down
a
new
york
eavesdropping
statute
for
failure
to
provide
for
the
giving
of
notice.
in
this
case,
though
the
bulk
of
the
conversations
were
minnie’s,
the
government
would
have
us
read
this
statute
that
notice
need
not
be
given
to
minnie
from
whom
the
property
was
taken.
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
does
not
equate
with
the
fourth
amendment
even
if
it
does
equate
with
the
literal
reading
of
2518
(8)
(d).
if
that
section
can
be
so
narrowly
construed,
like
a
person
from
whom
the
telephone
calls
were
taken
need
not
be
given
notice,
then
it
doesn’t
meet
the
requirements
of
this
court’s
decision
in
berger
and,
under
such
a
construction,
we
would
submit
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
i
see
that
my
time
is
going
and
i
would
just
like
to
refer
the
court
to
the
government
cited
case,
the
united
states
versus
la
gorga
at
365
f.
2d
or
rather
f.
7h.
it
gives
us
a
background
against
which
the
legislature
intended
title
iii
to
be
considered.
and
in
speaking
of
the
privacy
insured
by
the
fourth
amendment,
it
said
that
privacy
can
be
breached
by
a
search
warrant
under
conditions
set
out
in
the
amendment.
factually,
the
wiretapping
permitted
by
the
omnibus
crime
control
act
is
severely
limited
and
the
act
actually
prohibits
far
more
wiretapping
than
it
permits.
i
submit
then
to
the
court,
in
closing,
that
wiretapping
and
any
expansion
on
the
order
should
be
given
a
negative
rather
than
a
positive
reception
and
should
be
countenanced
only
in
circumstances
that
clearly
warranted,
and
this
is
not
such
a
case.
we
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit.
