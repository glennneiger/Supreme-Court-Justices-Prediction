justice

stewart
this
case
is
here
by
a
way
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
it
involves
a
wiretap
which
was
placed
on
the
home
telephones
of
one
of
the
respondents,
irving
kahn,
pursuant
to
a
court
order
under
title
iii
of
the
omnibus
crime
control
and
safe
streets
act
of
1970.
the
order,
which
was
added
by
a
district
judge
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
found
probable
cause
to
believe
that
irving
kahn
and
others,
as
yet
are
known,
were
conducting
and
illegal
gambling
business,
and
authorized
agents
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
to
intercept
gambling
communications
of
irving
kahn
and
others
as
yet
unknown.
the
agents
intercepted
incrementing
calls
made
my
mr.
kahn
in
arizona
to
his
wife,
the
respondent
minnie
kahn
at
their
home
in
chicago.
the
agents
also
intercepted
incrementing
calls
made
my
minnie
kahn
to
a
known
gambling
figure.
the
respondents
irving
and
minnie
kahn
were,
thereafter,
indited
for
violative
the
travel
act.
upon
being
notified
of
the
government’s
intention
to
introduce
the
intercepted
conversations
at
their
trial,
they
moved
to
suppress
them.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
and
a
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
under
the
wiretap
order,
all
intercepted
conversations
had
to
make
two
requirements
before
they
could
be
admitted
into
evidence.
first,
that
irving
kahn
be
a
party
to
the
conversations;
and
second,
that
his
conversations
intercepted
be
with
others
as
yet
unknown.
the
court
then
construed
the
provisions
of
title
iii
as
excluding
from
the
term
‘others
as
yet
unknown’,
any
persons
who,
careful
investigation
would
have
disclosed,
were
probably
using
the
telephones
for
illegal
activities.
since
the
government
had
not
shown
here
that
such
further
investigation
of
irving
kahn’s
activities
would
not
have
implicated
his
wife
in
the
gambling
business,
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
she
was
not
a
person
as
yet
unknown
within
the
purview
of
the
wiretap
order.
we
granted
certiorari
in
order
to
resolve
this
rather
narrow
issue
of
construction
of
this
new
federal
statute.
our
decision
today
does
not
involve
an
attack
upon
the
constitutionality
of
any
part
of
title
iii
of
the
omnibus
crime
and
safe
streets
act,
nor
does
it
involve
any
questions
relating
to
the
justice
department’s
internal
procedures
in
authorizing
the
application
for
the
wiretap.
rather,
the
question
presented
is
simply
whether
the
conversations
that
the
government
wishes
to
introduce
into
evidence
or
trial
are
made
inadmissible
by
the
specific
language
of
the
wiretap
order
in
this
case
or
by
the
specific
language
of
the
relevant
provisions
of
title
iii.
for
the
reasons
spelled
out
at
length
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
neither
the
provisions
of
title
iii,
nor
the
specific
language
of
the
wiretap
order
in
this
case,
support
the
result
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals.
title
iii
requires
the
naming
of
a
person
in
the
interception
order
only
when
the
government
has
probable
cause
to
believe
that
that
individual
is
committing
the
offense
for
which
the
wiretap
is
sought.
since
the
government
had
no
reason
here
to
suspect
mrs.
kahn
at
complicity
in
the
gambling
business
at
the
time
application
for
the
wiretap
order
was
made,
it
follows
that
she
was
among
the
class
of
others
as
yet
unknown
under
both
the
wiretap
order
and
title
iii.
we
further
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals’
conclusion
that
the
order
in
this
case
limited
the
government
to
the
interception
of
conversations
in
which
irving
kahn
himself
was
a
party.
the
order
speaks
of
conversations
of
irving
kahn
and
others
as
yet
unknown,
not
of
conversations
between
irving
kahn
and
others.
since
kahn,
therefore,
could
not
communicate
except
with
others,
the
reading
given
to
the
wiretap
order
by
the
court
of
appeals
would
render
the
others
as
yet
unknown
language
entirely
meaningless.
consequently,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
this
case
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today.
