justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
o'malley,
we
had
some
discussions,
i
notice
your
time
is
running
out.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whether
the
court
of
appeals
have
also
reversed
on
the
other
ground
namely
that
as
a
matter
of
exercise
of
discretion,
a
permissive
intervention.
judge
pence
had
denied
intervention.
in
the
court
of
appeal's
second
opinion,
not
the
first
one.
i
noticed
this
paragraph,
however
denial
of
appellant's
motion
for
permissive
intervention,
under
rule
24
(b)
was
in
our
judgment
erroneous.
is
that
a
disposition
of
the
other
ground?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
the
reason
i
wondered
is
that
comes
about
halfway
through
the
opinion.
i
admit
it
is
not
very
clear
and
then,
the
penultimate
paragraph,
deals
with
the
5
(b)
question,
we
conclude
that
it
was
order
for
the
court
below
that
appellants'
petitions
or
intervention
were
barred
by
5
(b).
i
wonder
if
the
former
paragraph
is
one
with
this
disposition

the
ninth
circuit
had
to
reach
that
to
reverse
it,
did
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so,
let
me
think
that
this
way,
do
you
think
that
both
issues
are
before
us
for
decision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
judge
pence
certify
an
appeal,
mr.
miller?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
miller?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
before
you
move
on,
does
the
record
show
whether
or
not,
as
a
matter
of
fact
any
of
these
60
justices,
governmental
agencies
that
try
to
intervene
had
relied
on
the
pendency
of
the
class
action
suit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
that's
the
input
of
that
one
sentence
relative
to
you
mr.
miller?
