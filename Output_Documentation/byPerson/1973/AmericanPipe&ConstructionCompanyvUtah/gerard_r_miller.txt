mr.
gerard
r.
miller
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
--
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
are
particularly
important.
the
state
of
utah
filed
its
class
action,
eleven
days
prior
to
the
running
of
the
suspension
period
provided
by
section
5
(b).
the
state
was
fully
aware
of
the
fact
that
that
suspension
period
was
about
to
run
and
it
undertook
to
protect
this
lesser
governmental
bodies.
those
are
the
--
at
least
some
of
them
are
the
respondents
before
this
court,
not
the
state.
no
question,
but
what
the
states,
the
antitrust
case
was
filed
timely
and
that?s
pending
before
judge
pence,
right
now.
the
state's
action
was
transferred
by
the
panel
down
to
california
in
the
first
major
thing
that
happened
was
that
the
motion
to
determine
the
class
was
brought
on
before
judge
pence.
judge
pence
indicated
clearly
in
my
mind
that
he
preferred
to
handle
these
matters
through
joined
intervention,
and
he
made
reference
to
his
vast
experience
in
handling
the
west
coast
pipe
cases
and
indicated
that
this
was
more
efficient,
a
more
desirable
way
to
proceed.
now,
the
class
action
that
was
alleged
by
the
state,
have
to
yield
the
affidavits
filed
in
support
thereof,
indicated
that
there
might
be
up
with
some
800
members
in
that
class
and
judge
pence
pointed
out
that
in
his
experience,
they
probably
wonder
why
would
it
be
that
many
members.
and,
he
pointed
to
the
fact
that
the
california,
hawaii,
washington,
oregon,
arizona
had
been
involved
in
the
west
coast
pipe
cases.
their
populations
were
much
greater
than
the
states
of
utah,
wyoming,
and
idaho,
and
he
indicated,
he
expect
that
they
would
have
one-sevenths
of
the
number
that
they
actually
had
turn
out.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
he
decided
that
we
could
not
maintain
the
class
action.
he,
as
the
ninth
circuit
indicated,
i
think
they're
actually
right,
he
invited
intervention
and
joinder.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
well,
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
do
anything
about
the
class
action,
because
judge
pence
wouldn?t
certify
for
appeal
and
his
counsel
already
pointed
out
that
he
is
going
to
appeal.
it
couldn?t
reasonably
fit
into
the
death
knell
theory
of
cases.
these
parties
were
not
before
the
court
of
that
time.
we
thought
that
the
only
reasonable
thing
to
do
for
these--
for
salt
lake
city,
salt
lake
county,
river
basin
and
all
the
rest
of
these
governmental
bodies
was
to
move
to
intervene
in
this
action.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
on
the
class
action?
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
yes,
he
did.
and
he
denied
it.
he
indicated
that
reasonable
lines
couldn?t
disagree.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
upon
denial
the
class
action?
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
well,
that
wasn't
denied,
until
later
on,
that
was
argued
at
the
same
time
as
the
motions
to
intervene,
your
honor.
when
judge
pence
read
his
opinion,
indicating
we
could
not
maintain
the
class
action,
the
first
thing
it
occurred
to
counsel
was
that
we
better
move
to
intervene
and
we
better
do
it
within
11
days,
because
that's
the
number
of
days
that
we're
left,
when
the
class
action
was
filed.
and
the
attorney
general
thereupon
sent
a
telegram
to
all
of
these
cities,
counties,
water
districts,
sewer
districts
advised
them
that
this
case
has
been
filed
in
their
behalf,
advised
them
that
the
court
had
now
decided
that
it
could
not
be
maintained
as
a
class
action
and
that
their
rights
would
be
in
jeopardy.
where
upon
some
60
somewhat
bodies
did
contact
the
attorney
general's
office
and
we
filed
the
motions
to
intervene
within
eight
days.
now,
there
were
five
governmental
bodies
that
did
not
move
to
intervene
until
the
29,
some
25
days
after
the
court's
ruling
and
after
the
11
days
remaining.
so,
we
get
both
situations
going
here.
i
don't
think
the
ninth
circuit
focused
upon
these
five
johnny-come-latelys'.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
yes,
your
honor
we
did
and
we
decided
that
there's
this
great
deal
of
talking,
there
is
talk
running
through
these
successive
opinions,
concerning
the
relationship
back.
and,
we
thought
that
our
best
bet
to
safeguard
their
rights
was
a
motion
intervene
in
this
specific
case
that
after
all
was
filed
on
may
13,
1969,
rather
than
risk
having
some
court
rule
that
well,
there?s
nothing
to
relate
back
to,
i
mean
admittedly
it?s
a
fiction.
we
thought
this
was
the
best
way
to
proceed.
the
motions
to
intervene
were
filed
to
get
it
to
propose
complaint
was
by
the
way
tracks
the
original
complaint
of
this
case,
when
counsel
talks
about
surprise
and
you
didn't
know
that
parties
before
and
i
think
are
these
strong
end
arguments,
because
he
knew
fully
well
when
the
class
action
was
filed
that
there
were
other
members
to
this
case
and
he
knew
at
that
time
that
he
should
have
known
or
should
have
been
in
the
position
to
expect
all
of
the
other,
certainly
all
of
the
other
lesser
governmental
bodies
of
utah
to
have
claims
before
the
court.
we
filed
the
applications
intervene
and
that
came
on
for
hearing
before
judge
pence
and
judge
pence
then,
rules,
"well,
i
can't
let
you
intervene,
because
the
statute
is
run."
well,
of
course
he
knew
the
statute
had
run
when
we
argued
the
class
action
matter.
that's
one
of
the
important
things
i
felt
that
was
argued
to
the
court,
but
look
if
the
court
rules
against
us
on
the
class
action,
we
are
going
to
have
serious
problems
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
well,
now,
he
says,
the
statute
has
run,
section
5
(b)
is
substantive
and
we
can't
let
procedural
rule
23
affect
it
in
any
way.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
yes
sir,
he
did
that
in
his
opinion
on
the
motions
to
intervene
in
dictum,
because
that
wasn?t
really
the
case
that
he
indicated
in
his
mind
--
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
right,
whether
--
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
that's
the
way
i
read
judge
pence's
opinion.
in
a
class
action
or
a
nonclass
and
the
one
that?s
maintained
or
one
that's
ordered
not
to
be
maintained,
still
the
members
of
that
class
must
come
in
and
file
something
specify
what?
to
complain
a
motion
to
intervene
before
the
statute
runs
and
their
rights
to
be
barred.
he
said,
"this
has
more
force
than
this
case,
well
i've
ruled
that
it
cannot
be
maintained."
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
well,
i
think
if
his
dictum
is
correct
then
--
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
i'm
not
so
sure
i
understand
your
question
sir.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
after
filing
the
motion?
after
the
applications
to
intervene?
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
well
we
appealed
the
denial
of
those
application
to
the
ninth
circuit.
now,
we
are
here
on
--
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
no,
not
that
the
class
action
aspect
has
not
been
appealed.
the
state
asked
that
it
might
be
certified
for
appeal
and
the
judge
denied
that.
these
applicants
after
all
were
before
the
court
only
in
the
sense
of
applying
for
intervention
and
that
was
after
the
class
action
ruling.
i
could
find
new
authority
for
an
unnamed
absent
member
of
a
class
that
have
been
ordered
not
to
be
maintained
to
pursue
appeal,
except
in
the
situation
we
had
a
death
knell
theory
and
then,
the
represented
party
versus
one
that?s
appealing
such
as
in
the
eisen
case,
saying
that
there
would
be
no
case,
if
its
not
a
class
action
there
would
be
no
case
at
all.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
yes
sir?
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
yes,
well
i
feel
that
it
does.
there
some
6
or
7
affidavits
indicating
that
they
were
aware
of
the
class
action
suit
that
they
discussed
it
with
me
or
with
one
of
my
partners,
or
with
someone
from
the
attorney
general's
office.
and
that
they
were
in
fact
relying
on
it,
they
were
waiting
for
it,
waiting
information
from
the
court,
waiting
for
notice
to
be
sent.
one
is
from
salt
lake
city,
one
is
from
salt
lake
county,
the
city
of
oregon,
weaver
county.
judge
pence
found
specifically
that
they
had
no
right
to
rely,
and
so
"they
did
not
rely"
that
was
one
of
his
findings.
now,
as
to
the
question
on
abuse
to
discretion,
which
just
been
mentioned,
judge
pence
did
exercise
his
discretion
as
to
these
specific
applicants,
he
did
it
in
so
far
as
the
claims
included
in
the
four
years
preceding
the
filing
of
the
applications
were
concerned.
in
other
words
he
said,
"these
claims
are
not
barred
and
so
these
parties
aren't
before
me
and
i
cannot
deny
their
motions
to
intervene."
he
did
that
back
in
march,
when
he
is
ruling
on
the
motions
for
intervention,
but
states
his
opinion
on
march
30,
1970.
and
so,
we
had
no
final
order
for
the
applicants,
it
was
necessary
then
to
have
a
meeting
with
all
the
applicants
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
want
to
sacrifice
their
claims
in
their
preceding
four
years,
in
order
that
we
can
secure
a
final
order
and
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit.
and
they
decided
that
there
would
be
the
better
course
to
pursue.
so
then,
we
amended
the
proposed
complainant
intervention
to
eliminate
those
years
that
were
not
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations,
whereupon
some
three
months
later
on
july
8,
judge
pence
then
entered
his
order,
indicated
once
a
final
order
that
the
claims
were
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations
in
denying
interventions.
so,
i
don't
feel,
i
don?t
and
i
certainly
feel
that
this
case
involved
abuse
of
discretion
in
any
way
and
if
in
fact
it
did,
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
properly
ruled
by
implication
that
once
the
invited
intervention
is
an
alternative
to
the
class
action
procedure,
even
though
it
might
include
some
300
members,
as
he
said,
350
members.
i
can
do
it
better
by
intervention
then
it
would
certainly
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
deny
those
applications
for
intervention.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that's
the
input.
(voice
overlap)
i
think,
it's
from
implication
in
the
whole
opinion,
certainly
it
has
already
to.
the
only
other
comment
i
had
on
abuse
of
discretion,
i
think
it
is
a
threshold
question
for
the
appellate
court
to
determine
whether
they
are
going
to
hear
the
case
on
the
merits
as
professor
moore
points
out.
it
is
almost
an
appellate
fiction,
if
they
say,
"well,
we
don't
want
to
hear
the
case,"
and
they
say,
"well,
he
exercises
discretion."
if
they
really
want
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
case,
then
they
reach
the
merits.
professor
moore
points
out
one
way
or
another,
they
usually
have
to
do
this
anyway.
well,
the
ninth
circuit
did
this
and
they
decided
the
case.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
no,
no,
their
claims
were
not
barred.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
you
wanted
as
a
--
to
include
in
the
class
only
those
unnamed
people
who
at
that
time,
at
the
moment
of
filing
the
suit
had
a
lawsuit
have
been
filed
by
those
people
individually,
would
have
been
timely?
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
right
that's
exactly
the
case
before
the
court.
now
rule
23
uses
two
words.
it
uses
the
word
"commence,"
it
uses
the
word
"maintain,"
and
it
clearly
indicates
that
there
are
two
events
that
will
take
place.
one,
an
action
will
be
commenced.
it"s
commenced
by
a
representative
party,
on
behalf
of
a
group
of
people,
the
class.
but
at
later
time
and
rule
23
specifies,
as
soon
as
practicable,
the
court
then,
will
determine
whether
or
not
that
action
shall
be
maintained
as
a
class
action.
two
different
events
entirely.
there"s
nothing
in
the
rule
23
about
reliance,
quite
to
the
contrary,
with
the
amendment,
now
that
the
unnamed
parties
you're
going
to
be
bound
by
that
judgment,
one
way
or
another,
always
necessary
that
they
receive
notice.
best
possible
notice
calculate
to
reach
them,
and
if
they
do
not
opt
that,
they're
going
to
be
bound
by
the
judgment.
they
don't
have
to
show
they
relied.
likewise,
in
section
5
(b),
provides
the
suspension
treaty
that
we're
dealing
with,
there's
nothing
there
that
concerns
relying
on
anything.
it
merely
provides
that
the
statute
will
run,
unless
an
action
is
commenced,
the
same
word.
unless
it?s
commenced
within
one
year
after
the
government
proceedings
have
ceased.
as
far
as
legislative
history
is
concerned,
i
think
there?s
certainly
no
legislative
history
on
this
point,
because
the
rule
was
amended
until
1966
and
it
wasn't,
it
isn't
reasonable
to
suggest
that
congress
had,
was
in
his
contemplation
what
would
happen
in
connection
with
the
procedural
rule
determined
by
this
court
as
to
how
you
commence
an
action.
and
then,
clearly
congress
left
that
up
to
this
court,
and
the
advisory
council
to
determine
the
rules
of
procedure
under
the
statutory
grant,
promulgate
proper
rules,
as
to
how
you
commence
an
action,
rule
23
said,
you
commence
an
action
by
filing
a
complaint.
there's
nothing
at
all
that
shocks
me
or
the
thought
that
on
the
state
of
utah
determine
that
they
wanted
to
undertake
to
protect
their
rights
of
its
cities
and
towns.
and
label
the
complaint,
a
class
action
that
defined
that
complaint
to
include
those
lesser
public
bodies,
the
purchased
pipes
from
these
defendants.
but
that
then
commenced
an
action
and
satisfied
section
5
(b).
now,
the
ninth
circuit,
i
think
properly
decided
this
question
and
i
think
they
gave
us,
in
my
mind
that
the
least
they
could?ve.
they
indicated
that
the
statute
then
may
--
once
the
court
determine
the
class
negatively,
determine
it
cannot
be
maintained,
then
the
statute
began
to
run
again,
11
days
began
to
run.
and
since,
at
least
the
majority
of
these
parties
filed
within
eight
days,
they
were
safely
inside
the
statute.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
better
rule
would
be
the
one,
i
think
was
expressed
by
justice
douglas
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
brunette
versus
new
york
central
railroad,
that
didn't
involve
class
action,
but
it
involve
a
similar
situation.
in
that
case,
in
fela
case,
the
plaintiff
filed
an
action
in
the
ohio
court
and
the
statute
then
run,
and
then
the
plaintiff
discovered
that
the
ohio
court
was
the
wrong
court
and
did
not
have
venue.
there
was
no
saving
statute
in
ohio
and
there
was
no
law
in
ohio
by
which
that
case
could
be
transferred
to
a
proper
court,
court
with
proper
venue.
so,
that
case
was
dismissed
and
eight
days
later,
interestingly
enough,
that
plaintiff
filed
an
action
in
the
federal
court.
and
this
court
held
that,
that
satisfied
the
statute
and
the
majority
in
that
opinion
indicated
that
the
statute
did
not
begin
to
run
again
until
the
appeal
time
that
run
in
ohio,
unless
that
was
a
final
order.
and
in
the
concurring
opinion,
i
feel
a
better
rule
stated
in
that
was
that
once
the
action
been
filed,
the
statute
of
limitations
were
satisfied
and
then,
the
manner
in
which
the
plaintiff
pursued
that
was
subject
to
latches.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
no,
he
does
not
do
so
specifically.
he
is
the
chief
legal
officer
of
the
state.
he
renders
opinions
to
those
entities
that
they
should
seek
opinions
from.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
well,
as
it
turns
out
he
did,
for
at
least
with
the
60
with
the
court.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
that
he
has
no
statutory
authority
to
automatically
represent
salt
lake
city
or
the
river
basin
in
water
conservancy
district.
but
when
the
attorney
general
was
faced
through
this
dilemma,
the
counsel
refers
to
this
solicitation
attorney
general
felt
that
it
was
his
duty.
he'd
be
remiss
in
his
duty
if
he
did
not
notify
these
people,
they
could
bring
their
actions.
i
suggest
that
any
rule,
other
than
the
one
that
ninth
circuit
came
up
with
and
that
is
a
decision
contrary
to
the
ninth
circuit,
will
do
violence
to
statute
of
limitations,
do
violence
to
the
true
congressional
attempt,
which
was
uniformity
of
application.
i
think
if
you
indulge
yourself
in
theories,
such
as
the
class
members
mostly
rely,
then
those
that
can
provide
reliance
to
satisfaction
one
judge
or
save
those
cannot
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
those
who
were
ignored,
if
the
classes
order
maintained,
possibly
they're
protected.
if
the
classes
order
not
maintained,
they're
not
protected,
so
you
have
an
unequal
application
of
the
statute
and
in
this
day
and
age,
especially
in
antitrust
litigation,
where
you
have
transfer
work
courts
and
transfer
re-courts.
and,
where
the
trial
court
can
amend
and
modify
the
class
action
order
anytime,
prior
to
judgment
on
the
merits,
and
then
even
after
that
you
have
the
appellate
court
as
in
hershey
saying,
"no,
no
there's
really
should
have
been
a
class."
if
you
make
the
statute
dependent
upon
whether
or
not
a
court
ultimately
orders
that
the
class
be
maintained,
this
is
going
to
be
very
much
like
springing
and
shifting
uses.
you
are
going
to
have
the
statute
popping
it
up
and
shifting
around
at
various
times
for
various
persons,
depending
on
their
situation,
depending
on
what
the
court,
finally
decided
which
a
situation
for
their
class
action.
we
feel
that
the
ninth
circuit
decided
this
in
the
only
appropriate
way
that
the
ninth
circuit
did
justice
and
that
their
decision
is
proper.
we
submit.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
a
permissive
intervention,
your
honor?
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
no,
i
think
the
law
there
is
that
the
words
that
are
used
by
the
appellate
court
is
that
if
an
abuse
and
discretion
was
shown,
then
it
is
appealable,
we?ll
hear
it
on
the
merits.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
yes,
yes.
oh!
i
think
that's
settled.
are
there
any
other
questions?
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
mr.
chief
justice
--
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
--
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
are
particularly
important.
the
state
of
utah
filed
its
class
action,
eleven
days
prior
to
the
running
of
the
suspension
period
provided
by
section
5
(b).
the
state
was
fully
aware
of
the
fact
that
that
suspension
period
was
about
to
run
and
it
undertook
to
protect
this
lesser
governmental
bodies.
those
are
the
--
at
least
some
of
them
are
the
respondents
before
this
court,
not
the
state.
no
question,
but
what
the
states,
the
antitrust
case
was
filed
timely
and
that?s
pending
before
judge
pence,
right
now.
the
state's
action
was
transferred
by
the
panel
down
to
california
in
the
first
major
thing
that
happened
was
that
the
motion
to
determine
the
class
was
brought
on
before
judge
pence.
judge
pence
indicated
clearly
in
my
mind
that
he
preferred
to
handle
these
matters
through
joined
intervention,
and
he
made
reference
to
his
vast
experience
in
handling
the
west
coast
pipe
cases
and
indicated
that
this
was
more
efficient,
a
more
desirable
way
to
proceed.
now,
the
class
action
that
was
alleged
by
the
state,
have
to
yield
the
affidavits
filed
in
support
thereof,
indicated
that
there
might
be
up
with
some
800
members
in
that
class
and
judge
pence
pointed
out
that
in
his
experience,
they
probably
wonder
why
would
it
be
that
many
members.
and,
he
pointed
to
the
fact
that
the
california,
hawaii,
washington,
oregon,
arizona
had
been
involved
in
the
west
coast
pipe
cases.
their
populations
were
much
greater
than
the
states
of
utah,
wyoming,
and
idaho,
and
he
indicated,
he
expect
that
they
would
have
one-sevenths
of
the
number
that
they
actually
had
turn
out.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
he
decided
that
we
could
not
maintain
the
class
action.
he,
as
the
ninth
circuit
indicated,
i
think
they're
actually
right,
he
invited
intervention
and
joinder.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
well,
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
do
anything
about
the
class
action,
because
judge
pence
wouldn?t
certify
for
appeal
and
his
counsel
already
pointed
out
that
he
is
going
to
appeal.
it
couldn?t
reasonably
fit
into
the
death
knell
theory
of
cases.
these
parties
were
not
before
the
court
of
that
time.
we
thought
that
the
only
reasonable
thing
to
do
for
these--
for
salt
lake
city,
salt
lake
county,
river
basin
and
all
the
rest
of
these
governmental
bodies
was
to
move
to
intervene
in
this
action.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
on
the
class
action?
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
yes,
he
did.
and
he
denied
it.
he
indicated
that
reasonable
lines
couldn?t
disagree.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
upon
denial
the
class
action?
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
well,
that
wasn't
denied,
until
later
on,
that
was
argued
at
the
same
time
as
the
motions
to
intervene,
your
honor.
when
judge
pence
read
his
opinion,
indicating
we
could
not
maintain
the
class
action,
the
first
thing
it
occurred
to
counsel
was
that
we
better
move
to
intervene
and
we
better
do
it
within
11
days,
because
that's
the
number
of
days
that
we're
left,
when
the
class
action
was
filed.
and
the
attorney
general
thereupon
sent
a
telegram
to
all
of
these
cities,
counties,
water
districts,
sewer
districts
advised
them
that
this
case
has
been
filed
in
their
behalf,
advised
them
that
the
court
had
now
decided
that
it
could
not
be
maintained
as
a
class
action
and
that
their
rights
would
be
in
jeopardy.
where
upon
some
60
somewhat
bodies
did
contact
the
attorney
general's
office
and
we
filed
the
motions
to
intervene
within
eight
days.
now,
there
were
five
governmental
bodies
that
did
not
move
to
intervene
until
the
29,
some
25
days
after
the
court's
ruling
and
after
the
11
days
remaining.
so,
we
get
both
situations
going
here.
i
don't
think
the
ninth
circuit
focused
upon
these
five
johnny-come-latelys'.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
yes,
your
honor
we
did
and
we
decided
that
there's
this
great
deal
of
talking,
there
is
talk
running
through
these
successive
opinions,
concerning
the
relationship
back.
and,
we
thought
that
our
best
bet
to
safeguard
their
rights
was
a
motion
intervene
in
this
specific
case
that
after
all
was
filed
on
may
13,
1969,
rather
than
risk
having
some
court
rule
that
well,
there?s
nothing
to
relate
back
to,
i
mean
admittedly
it?s
a
fiction.
we
thought
this
was
the
best
way
to
proceed.
the
motions
to
intervene
were
filed
to
get
it
to
propose
complaint
was
by
the
way
tracks
the
original
complaint
of
this
case,
when
counsel
talks
about
surprise
and
you
didn't
know
that
parties
before
and
i
think
are
these
strong
end
arguments,
because
he
knew
fully
well
when
the
class
action
was
filed
that
there
were
other
members
to
this
case
and
he
knew
at
that
time
that
he
should
have
known
or
should
have
been
in
the
position
to
expect
all
of
the
other,
certainly
all
of
the
other
lesser
governmental
bodies
of
utah
to
have
claims
before
the
court.
we
filed
the
applications
intervene
and
that
came
on
for
hearing
before
judge
pence
and
judge
pence
then,
rules,
"well,
i
can't
let
you
intervene,
because
the
statute
is
run."
well,
of
course
he
knew
the
statute
had
run
when
we
argued
the
class
action
matter.
that's
one
of
the
important
things
i
felt
that
was
argued
to
the
court,
but
look
if
the
court
rules
against
us
on
the
class
action,
we
are
going
to
have
serious
problems
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
well,
now,
he
says,
the
statute
has
run,
section
5
(b)
is
substantive
and
we
can't
let
procedural
rule
23
affect
it
in
any
way.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
yes
sir,
he
did
that
in
his
opinion
on
the
motions
to
intervene
in
dictum,
because
that
wasn?t
really
the
case
that
he
indicated
in
his
mind
--
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
right,
whether
--
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
that's
the
way
i
read
judge
pence's
opinion.
in
a
class
action
or
a
nonclass
and
the
one
that?s
maintained
or
one
that's
ordered
not
to
be
maintained,
still
the
members
of
that
class
must
come
in
and
file
something
specify
what?
to
complain
a
motion
to
intervene
before
the
statute
runs
and
their
rights
to
be
barred.
he
said,
"this
has
more
force
than
this
case,
well
i've
ruled
that
it
cannot
be
maintained."
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
well,
i
think
if
his
dictum
is
correct
then
--
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
i'm
not
so
sure
i
understand
your
question
sir.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
after
filing
the
motion?
after
the
applications
to
intervene?
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
well
we
appealed
the
denial
of
those
application
to
the
ninth
circuit.
now,
we
are
here
on
--
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
no,
not
that
the
class
action
aspect
has
not
been
appealed.
the
state
asked
that
it
might
be
certified
for
appeal
and
the
judge
denied
that.
these
applicants
after
all
were
before
the
court
only
in
the
sense
of
applying
for
intervention
and
that
was
after
the
class
action
ruling.
i
could
find
new
authority
for
an
unnamed
absent
member
of
a
class
that
have
been
ordered
not
to
be
maintained
to
pursue
appeal,
except
in
the
situation
we
had
a
death
knell
theory
and
then,
the
represented
party
versus
one
that?s
appealing
such
as
in
the
eisen
case,
saying
that
there
would
be
no
case,
if
its
not
a
class
action
there
would
be
no
case
at
all.
now,
i
think
--
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
yes
sir?
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
yes,
well
i
feel
that
it
does.
there
some
6
or
7
affidavits
indicating
that
they
were
aware
of
the
class
action
suit
that
they
discussed
it
with
me
or
with
one
of
my
partners,
or
with
someone
from
the
attorney
general's
office.
and
that
they
were
in
fact
relying
on
it,
they
were
waiting
for
it,
waiting
information
from
the
court,
waiting
for
notice
to
be
sent.
one
is
from
salt
lake
city,
one
is
from
salt
lake
county,
the
city
of
oregon,
weaver
county.
judge
pence
found
specifically
that
they
had
no
right
to
rely,
and
so
"they
did
not
rely"
that
was
one
of
his
findings.
now,
as
to
the
question
on
abuse
to
discretion,
which
just
been
mentioned,
judge
pence
did
exercise
his
discretion
as
to
these
specific
applicants,
he
did
it
in
so
far
as
the
claims
included
in
the
four
years
preceding
the
filing
of
the
applications
were
concerned.
in
other
words
he
said,
"these
claims
are
not
barred
and
so
these
parties
aren't
before
me
and
i
cannot
deny
their
motions
to
intervene."
he
did
that
back
in
march,
when
he
is
ruling
on
the
motions
for
intervention,
but
states
his
opinion
on
march
30,
1970.
and
so,
we
had
no
final
order
for
the
applicants,
it
was
necessary
then
to
have
a
meeting
with
all
the
applicants
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
want
to
sacrifice
their
claims
in
their
preceding
four
years,
in
order
that
we
can
secure
a
final
order
and
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit.
and
they
decided
that
there
would
be
the
better
course
to
pursue.
so
then,
we
amended
the
proposed
complainant
intervention
to
eliminate
those
years
that
were
not
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations,
whereupon
some
three
months
later
on
july
8,
judge
pence
then
entered
his
order,
indicated
once
a
final
order
that
the
claims
were
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations
in
denying
interventions.
so,
i
don't
feel,
i
don?t
and
i
certainly
feel
that
this
case
involved
abuse
of
discretion
in
any
way
and
if
in
fact
it
did,
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
properly
ruled
by
implication
that
once
the
invited
intervention
is
an
alternative
to
the
class
action
procedure,
even
though
it
might
include
some
300
members,
as
he
said,
350
members.
i
can
do
it
better
by
intervention
then
it
would
certainly
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
deny
those
applications
for
intervention.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that's
the
input.
(voice
overlap)
i
think,
it's
from
implication
in
the
whole
opinion,
certainly
it
has
already
to.
the
only
other
comment
i
had
on
abuse
of
discretion,
i
think
it
is
a
threshold
question
for
the
appellate
court
to
determine
whether
they
are
going
to
hear
the
case
on
the
merits
as
professor
moore
points
out.
it
is
almost
an
appellate
fiction,
if
they
say,
"well,
we
don't
want
to
hear
the
case,"
and
they
say,
"well,
he
exercises
discretion."
if
they
really
want
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
case,
then
they
reach
the
merits.
professor
moore
points
out
one
way
or
another,
they
usually
have
to
do
this
anyway.
well,
the
ninth
circuit
did
this
and
they
decided
the
case.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
no,
no,
their
claims
were
not
barred.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
you
wanted
as
a
--
to
include
in
the
class
only
those
unnamed
people
who
at
that
time,
at
the
moment
of
filing
the
suit
had
a
lawsuit
have
been
filed
by
those
people
individually,
would
have
been
timely?
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
right
that's
exactly
the
case
before
the
court.
now
rule
23
uses
two
words.
it
uses
the
word
"commence,"
it
uses
the
word
"maintain,"
and
it
clearly
indicates
that
there
are
two
events
that
will
take
place.
one,
an
action
will
be
commenced.
it"s
commenced
by
a
representative
party,
on
behalf
of
a
group
of
people,
the
class.
but
at
later
time
and
rule
23
specifies,
as
soon
as
practicable,
the
court
then,
will
determine
whether
or
not
that
action
shall
be
maintained
as
a
class
action.
two
different
events
entirely.
there"s
nothing
in
the
rule
23
about
reliance,
quite
to
the
contrary,
with
the
amendment,
now
that
the
unnamed
parties
you're
going
to
be
bound
by
that
judgment,
one
way
or
another,
always
necessary
that
they
receive
notice.
best
possible
notice
calculate
to
reach
them,
and
if
they
do
not
opt
that,
they're
going
to
be
bound
by
the
judgment.
they
don't
have
to
show
they
relied.
likewise,
in
section
5
(b),
provides
the
suspension
treaty
that
we're
dealing
with,
there's
nothing
there
that
concerns
relying
on
anything.
it
merely
provides
that
the
statute
will
run,
unless
an
action
is
commenced,
the
same
word.
unless
it?s
commenced
within
one
year
after
the
government
proceedings
have
ceased.
as
far
as
legislative
history
is
concerned,
i
think
there?s
certainly
no
legislative
history
on
this
point,
because
the
rule
was
amended
until
1966
and
it
wasn't,
it
isn't
reasonable
to
suggest
that
congress
had,
was
in
his
contemplation
what
would
happen
in
connection
with
the
procedural
rule
determined
by
this
court
as
to
how
you
commence
an
action.
and
then,
clearly
congress
left
that
up
to
this
court,
and
the
advisory
council
to
determine
the
rules
of
procedure
under
the
statutory
grant,
promulgate
proper
rules,
as
to
how
you
commence
an
action,
rule
23
said,
you
commence
an
action
by
filing
a
complaint.
there's
nothing
at
all
that
shocks
me
or
the
thought
that
on
the
state
of
utah
determine
that
they
wanted
to
undertake
to
protect
their
rights
of
its
cities
and
towns.
and
label
the
complaint,
a
class
action
that
defined
that
complaint
to
include
those
lesser
public
bodies,
the
purchased
pipes
from
these
defendants.
but
that
then
commenced
an
action
and
satisfied
section
5
(b).
now,
the
ninth
circuit,
i
think
properly
decided
this
question
and
i
think
they
gave
us,
in
my
mind
that
the
least
they
could?ve.
they
indicated
that
the
statute
then
may
--
once
the
court
determine
the
class
negatively,
determine
it
cannot
be
maintained,
then
the
statute
began
to
run
again,
11
days
began
to
run.
and
since,
at
least
the
majority
of
these
parties
filed
within
eight
days,
they
were
safely
inside
the
statute.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
a
better
rule
would
be
the
one,
i
think
was
expressed
by
justice
douglas
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
brunette
versus
new
york
central
railroad,
that
didn't
involve
class
action,
but
it
involve
a
similar
situation.
in
that
case,
in
fela
case,
the
plaintiff
filed
an
action
in
the
ohio
court
and
the
statute
then
run,
and
then
the
plaintiff
discovered
that
the
ohio
court
was
the
wrong
court
and
did
not
have
venue.
there
was
no
saving
statute
in
ohio
and
there
was
no
law
in
ohio
by
which
that
case
could
be
transferred
to
a
proper
court,
court
with
proper
venue.
so,
that
case
was
dismissed
and
eight
days
later,
interestingly
enough,
that
plaintiff
filed
an
action
in
the
federal
court.
and
this
court
held
that,
that
satisfied
the
statute
and
the
majority
in
that
opinion
indicated
that
the
statute
did
not
begin
to
run
again
until
the
appeal
time
that
run
in
ohio,
unless
that
was
a
final
order.
and
in
the
concurring
opinion,
i
feel
a
better
rule
stated
in
that
was
that
once
the
action
been
filed,
the
statute
of
limitations
were
satisfied
and
then,
the
manner
in
which
the
plaintiff
pursued
that
was
subject
to
latches.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
no,
he
does
not
do
so
specifically.
he
is
the
chief
legal
officer
of
the
state.
he
renders
opinions
to
those
entities
that
they
should
seek
opinions
from.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
well,
as
it
turns
out
he
did,
for
at
least
with
the
60
with
the
court.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
that
he
has
no
statutory
authority
to
automatically
represent
salt
lake
city
or
the
river
basin
in
water
conservancy
district.
but
when
the
attorney
general
was
faced
through
this
dilemma,
the
counsel
refers
to
this
solicitation
attorney
general
felt
that
it
was
his
duty.
he'd
be
remiss
in
his
duty
if
he
did
not
notify
these
people,
they
could
bring
their
actions.
i
suggest
that
any
rule,
other
than
the
one
that
ninth
circuit
came
up
with
and
that
is
a
decision
contrary
to
the
ninth
circuit,
will
do
violence
to
statute
of
limitations,
do
violence
to
the
true
congressional
attempt,
which
was
uniformity
of
application.
i
think
if
you
indulge
yourself
in
theories,
such
as
the
class
members
mostly
rely,
then
those
that
can
provide
reliance
to
satisfaction
one
judge
or
save
those
cannot
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
those
who
were
ignored,
if
the
classes
order
maintained,
possibly
they're
protected.
if
the
classes
order
not
maintained,
they're
not
protected,
so
you
have
an
unequal
application
of
the
statute
and
in
this
day
and
age,
especially
in
antitrust
litigation,
where
you
have
transfer
work
courts
and
transfer
re-courts.
and,
where
the
trial
court
can
amend
and
modify
the
class
action
order
anytime,
prior
to
judgment
on
the
merits,
and
then
even
after
that
you
have
the
appellate
court
as
in
hershey
saying,
"no,
no
there's
really
should
have
been
a
class."
if
you
make
the
statute
dependent
upon
whether
or
not
a
court
ultimately
orders
that
the
class
be
maintained,
this
is
going
to
be
very
much
like
springing
and
shifting
uses.
you
are
going
to
have
the
statute
popping
it
up
and
shifting
around
at
various
times
for
various
persons,
depending
on
their
situation,
depending
on
what
the
court,
finally
decided
which
a
situation
for
their
class
action.
we
feel
that
the
ninth
circuit
decided
this
in
the
only
appropriate
way
that
the
ninth
circuit
did
justice
and
that
their
decision
is
proper.
we
submit.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
a
permissive
intervention,
your
honor?
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
no,
i
think
the
law
there
is
that
the
words
that
are
used
by
the
appellate
court
is
that
if
an
abuse
and
discretion
was
shown,
then
it
is
appealable,
we?ll
hear
it
on
the
merits.
mr.
gerard
r.
miller
yes,
yes.
oh!
i
think
that's
settled.
are
there
any
other
questions?
