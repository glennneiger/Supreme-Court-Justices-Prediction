justice
william

rehnquist
mr.
o'malley,
is
there
anything
peculiar
to
the
section
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act
about
the
ninth
circuit?s
reasoning
here?
wouldn't
it
apply
equally
well
to
any
other
claim
of
statute
of
limitation.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
o'malley,
isn't
possible
to
defend
judge
pence's
decision
in
the
district
court
consistently
with
the
reasoning
of
the
ninth
circuit,
saying
in
effect
that
the
statute
was
tolled
during
the
pendency
of
the
action,
but
in
the
times
following
judge
pence's
ruling
on
the
class
action,
the
11
days
afterwards
that
the
plaintiffs
were
then
under
an
obligation
to
file
actions
of
their
own
and
it
is
decision,
denying
intervention
might
be
justified
on
grounds
applicable
to
intervention,
without
saying
that
they
were
cut-off,
had
they
chosen
to
file
their
actions,
rather
than
to
intervene
in
utah's
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
give
any
thought
on
behalf
of
the
client
you
have
represent
to
filing
separate
original
actions
within
the
11
days,
rather
than
just
moving
to
intervene
in
the
state
of
utah?s
action?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
miller,
is
it
well
settled
that
an
order
denying
a
motion
intervene
is
appealable
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
under
1291,
is
it
consider
final
decision
of
the
district
court,
under
28
u.s.c.
1291?
