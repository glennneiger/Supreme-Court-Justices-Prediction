well,
that
would
be
impossible
for
the
members
of
the
class
as
this
case,
utah
didn't
file
until
11
days
before
the
year
expired
at
the
time
the
corporate
get
a
ground
ruling
on
the
class,
the
one-year
period
wouldn't
expire
to
all
unnamed
members.

unless
you
are
going

as
i
was
asking,
whether
pending
the
court's
ruling
the
limitation
period
is
tolled.
justice

so
you
did
say
then
that
in

unnamed

could
not
participate
in
the
action
at
all.
justice

justice

well,
judge

did
the
say
that
it
is
of
second
reason
intervention
just
isn't
permissible
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
what
happened
to
that
ground
of
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
byron

white
they
just
didn't
raise
it?
justice
byron

white
even
if
they
weren't
barred
by
the
statute
of

they
have
been
allowed
to
intervene.
justice

white
--which
judge

justice
byron

white
did
judge
pence
indicate
that
even
if
the
class
action
whether
accepted
even
if
the
case
could
go
forward
as
a
class
action
that
nevertheless
in
order
to
prevent
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
unnamed
members
would
have
to
come
in
and
identify
themselves?
justice
byron

white
so
it
would
be
for
the
statute
of
limitations
purposes,
it
really
was
something
irrelevant?
justice
byron

whether
the

was

you're
not
--
i
suppose
in
this
case
you're
not
urging
that
the

you
wanted
define,
included
people,
whose
claims
are
already
barred?
justice
byron

white
in
other
words,
in
utah,
does
the
attorney
general
represent
your
separate
independent
local

justice
byron

white
well,
if
separate

have
been
instituted
here,
would
he
have
