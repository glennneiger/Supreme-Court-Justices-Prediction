justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
case
involves
an
aspect
of
the
relationship
between
a
statute
of
limitations
and
the
provisions
of
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
23,
regulating
class
actions
in
the
federal
courts.
the
question
presented
is
a
rather
technical
one
and
the
history
of
the
litigation
in
which
the
question
arises
is
quite
complex.
so,
that
this
case
is
not
the
one
in
which
a
lengthy
oral
announcement
is
appropriate.
suffice
it
to
say
that
the
state
of
utah
brought
an
antitrust
action
against
the
petitioners
11
days
before
the
action
would
have
been
barred
by
the
applicable
statute
of
limitations.
the
suit
was
brought
as
a
class
action.
several
weeks
later
the
petitioners
filed
a
motion
for
an
order
that
the
suit
could
not
be
maintained
as
the
class
action.
the
district
court
subsequently
granted
this
motion
upon
the
ground
that
the
class
was
not
so
numerous
that
joinder
of
all
of
members,
as
named
plaintiffs,
would
be
impractical.
eight
days
after
entry
of
this
order,
several
members
of
the
punitive
class
sought
to
intervene
as
plaintiffs
in
utah’s
suit.
the
district
court
denied
the
motion
to
intervene
upon
the
ground
that
they
would
be,
intervenor’s
claims,
were
now
barred
by
the
applicable
statute
of
limitations.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
this
judgment.
for
the
reasons
set
out
at
some
lengths
in
the
written
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
from
the
date
utah’s
suit
was
filed
until
the
date
of
the
district
court’s
order
holding
that
a
class
suit
was
inappropriate,
the
statute
of
limitations
was
told
as
to
members
of
the
punitive
class.
since
they
sought
to
intervene
eight
days
after
the
district
court’s
order,
and
since
there
were
11
days
yet
to
run
at
the
time
of
the
order,
their
motion
to
intervene
was
timely.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
affirmed.
mr.
justice
blackmun,
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
