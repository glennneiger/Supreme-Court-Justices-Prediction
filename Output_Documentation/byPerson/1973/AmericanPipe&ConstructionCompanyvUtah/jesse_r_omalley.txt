mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
narrow
question
involved
is
the
validity
of
the
order
of
the
trial
court,
denying
intervention
by
respondents
in
an
antitrust
treble-damage
action
based
upon
a
prior
government
action
after
the
running
of
the
pertinent
statute
of
limitations,
section
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act.
before
beginning,
i
should
note
that
i
shall
be
referring
to
the
key
dates,
which
are
pertinent
to
this
statute
of
limitations
question
and
these
key
dates
are
set
forth
in
the
record
appendix,
pages
1
to
4
in
summary
form.
and
i
should
also
indicate
that
the
statutes,
which
we
believe
to
be
pertinent
in
controlling
and
the
rules
of
court,
are
set
forth
in
the
following
six
pages
also
of
the
record
appendix.
as
i
indicated,
this
case
is
based
upon
a
denial
of
a
motion
made
by
respondents
in
the
central
district
of
california.
in
december
1969,
to
intervene
in
an
antitrust
damage
action,
which
have
been
filed
by
the
state
of
utah
on
may
13,
1969
and
has
a
purported
class
action.
the
utah
complaint
alleges
that
the
action
was
based
on
prior
government,
criminal
and
equitable
actions.
and
thus,
by
reasons
of
the
prior
government
actions
and
pursuant
to
the
tolling
provisions
of
sections
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act,
the
state
of
utah
was
able
to
bring
this
action,
based
upon
alleged
acts,
which
entered
in
1962.
the
government
criminal
action
in
which
the
utah
complaint
was
based
was
beyond
march
10,
1964
and
was
terminated
as
to
all
defendants
on
june
19,
1964.
a
separate
government
civil
action
filed
after
the
criminal
action
ended,
it
was
terminated
as
to
all
defendants,
except
american
pipe
and
construction
company
on
december
8,
1967.
with
the
final
judgment
as
to
american
pipe
and
construction
company,
it
wasn?t
filed
until
may
24,
1968
and
as
by
reason
of
this
day
of
may
24,
1968
that
the
trial
court
has
held
at
the
date
of
one
year
later,
may
24,
1969
was
the
date
of
the
statute
of
limitations
finally
ran
in
this
case.
the
district
court
on
december
4,
1969
entered
in
order
that
utah
action
did
not
constitute
a
class
action
and
subsequently,
entered
an
order
made
after
that
denial
of
the
class
action
by
respondents,
the
denying
respondents?
motion
to
intervene.
it
is
this
order
denying
intervention
at
this
juncture,
which
is
a
subject
of
these
appellate
proceedings.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
order
of
the
trial
court
denying
leave
to
intervene
and
held
that
this
suit
was
instituted
on
behalf
of
respondents.
by
the
filing
of
the
utah
complaint
on
may
13,
1969,
even
though
the
prerequisites
to
our
class
action
had
not
been
met
by
the
state
of
utah
and
even
though
respondents
took
no
action,
no
step,
whatsoever
to
intervene,
until
december
19,
1969,
a
date
more
than
five
months
after
the
limitations
period
prescribed
by
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act.
the
narrow
question
involves
therefore,
is
whether
respondents,
who
had
not
filed
suit
within
the
period
prescribed
by
section
5
(b),
were
appropriate
before
the
trial
court
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
state
of
utah
erroneously
designated
its
cause
of
action
as
a
class
action,
and
though
this
case
may
appear
to
have
very
superficial,
factual,
or
complexity
of
terms
on
the
very
simple
issue
of
congressional
intent
in
enacting
section
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
yes,
indeed
and
that
is
of
course
as
we
have
planned
out,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
connection
with
our
petition
for
certiorari,
this
has
the
effect
as
we
see
it
of
affecting
in
every
federal
statute
of
limitations.
by
the
mere
fact
that
a
class
action
is
typed
on
our
complaint,
even
though
one
does
not
in
fact
exist,
it
has
the
effect
by
virtue
of
the
act
of
a
private
party
of
tolling
the
statute
of
limitations
and
i
would
say
yes
indeed
that
is
indeed
one
of
the
major
issues,
not
only
in
so
far
as
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act
is
concerned,
which
is
pertinent
to
this
case,
but
i
think
the
principle
is
applicable
equally,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
to
every
federal
statute
of
limitation.
i
would
submit
that
the
intent,
in
connection
with
5
(b)
as
to
what
the
statute
really
means
is
clearly
stated
in
the
barring
provision
of
the
statute
and
it
is
also
stated
we
submit
with
some
precision
and
the
legislative
reports
underlying
the
statute.
it
should
first
be
noted
that
the
state
of
utah
is
in
court
only
because
of
5
(b),
which
provides
for
the
suspension
of
the
government
--
of
the
statute
of
limitations
during
the
pendency
of
the
government
antitrust
action
in
which
limits
the
period
--
in
which
the
litigant
may
commence
an
action
based
upon
the
government
suit.
to
the
period
of
the
pendency
over
the
government
civil
or
criminal
action,
and
within
one
year
thereafter,
respondents
did
not
move
within
that
statutory
period
and
were
not
before
the
court,
until
after
the
one
year
suspension
period,
unless
the
filing
of
the
invalid
class
action
by
utah
has
a
legal
effect
of
bringing
respondents
before
the
court.
in
order
to
escape
the
barring
provisions
of
the
clayton
act,
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
via
legal
section
treats
the
respondents
as
if
they
had
filed
suits
simultaneously
with
the
state
of
utah.
however,
factually
it
is
not
with
--
there's
no
dispute
about
this.
they
had
done
nothing
in
any
factual
sense
at
that
time.
they?d
done
nothing
whatsoever
and
they
haven't
brought
an
action
of
their
own
volition
and
they
hadn't
move
to
intervene
and
either
of
these
steps
would
merely
have
required
the
respondents
to
file
a
short
and
plain
statement
of
the
alleged
violations
and
its
purported
impact
upon
the
plaintiff.and
we
submit
that
in
enacting
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act,
the
congress
clearly
intended
to
spell
out
the
requirement
that
each
plaintiff
relying
up
on
section
5
(b)
to
toll
a
statute
of
limitations,
must
take
the
minimal
step
of
stating
its
claim
within
the
period
prescribed
by
the
statute.now,
where
there
is
no
class
action,
of
course
that
would
require
the
filing
of
the
short
and
plain
statement
of
the
claim,
pursuant
to
rule
8
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
but
in
the
case
of
a
--
mr.
justice
white,
of
a
proper
class
action,
we
would
submit
that
it
is
the
legislative
intent
in
enacting
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act
that
each
member
of
the
class
respond
affirmatively
to
the
order
of
the
court
inviting
the
members
of
that
class
to
state
their
claims
and
that
they
do
so
within
the
period
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
well,
of
course,
you
have
to,
that
is
--
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
no,
to
say
that
pending
the
court's
action
pursuant
to
rule
23,
the
action
is
tolled,
is
to
say
that
rule
23
in
some
manner
abridges
or
modifies
section
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
i
am
saying
that
they
cannot
do
so,
unless
they
affirmatively
--
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
yes,
and
i
would
point
out
however
that
was
in
the
--
this
action
had
--
this
is
not
the
bare
bones,
this
is
not
one
case,
it's
a
series
of
cases
and
practically
there
were
pursuant
at
least
in
seven
prior
class
actions
and
invitations
to
join,
but
forgetting
that
factual
background,
the
fact
is
that
they
did
not
move
to
intervene
at
any
time
within
the
statutory
period
and
i
would
took
some
myth,
that
unless
it
is
held
that
rule
23,
somehow
abridges
or
somehow
modifies,
section
5
(b)
of
clayton
act,
there
is
no
power
in
the
court
to
permit
intervention
after
the
period
of
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
i
would
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
in
the
affirmist,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
very
clearly,
it
would
be
possible
to,
within
the
discretionary
realm
of
the
--
that
supported
the
trial
court,
under
rule
of
24
(b)
to
justify
the
acts
of
the
trial
court
tolling,
in
terms
of
the
motion
as
being
clearly
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
by
reason
of
its
knowledge
and
experience
in
the
west
coast
pipe
case
which
have
preceded
and
within
the
framework
at
the
time
that
was
available
through
the
respondents
during
the
period
prior
to
the
running
of
the
statute
and
in
the
framework
of
the
fact
that
the
facts
of
this
case
showed
that
counsel
for
that
is
preparing
on
behalf
of
response
in
this
case,
at
this
time
they
couldn't
study
this
action
for
six
months
and
this
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
suit,
it
was
charge
with
the
problems
of
knowledge
of
the
problems
of
the
statute
of
limitations
growing
out
of
the
prior
litigation.
i
think
in
the
light
of
that
history,
clearly
the
court
is
justified
in
exercising
its
discretion
and
i
think
in
incorporating
its
decision
respecting
the
class
action
in
this
decision
on
the
motions
to
intervene
i
think
the
theory
was
exercising
the
discretion.
your
honor,
it
was
referred
--
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
yes.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
well,
it
was
argued
--
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
in
terms
of
the
briefs
before
the
court
of
appeals.
we
argued
two
points:
(1)
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
respondents
to
show
an
abuse
of
the
discretion,
which
had
been
exercised
by
the
trial
court
and
that
we
argued
that
they
had
not
shown
such
an
abuse.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
that
is
correct.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
yes
and
the
--
surprisingly
to
say
that
except
for
the
dissenting
opinion
by
the
ninth
circuit,
the
dissenting
opinion
stated
in
so
many
words
that
was
the
judgment
of
the
court
that
the
trial
court
has
considered
this
and
as
a
matter
of
discretion
and
exercising
that
discretion,
that
discretion
should
be
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
yes,
your
honor.
the
question
was
raised
in
the
--
during
before
the
recess
as
to
whether
members
of
the
purported
class,
court
having
an
intervene
in
the
eleven-day
period,
before
the
statute
of
limitations
run
assuming
there
was
a
valid
class
action.
of
course,
that
is
not
this
case
or
the
trial
court,
specifically
held
and
it
has
not
been
the
subject
of
any
appeal
that
there
is
no
class
action
in
this
case.
but,
i
should
point
out
that
--
well,
that
has
been
found
that
the
members
of
the
nonclass
are
no
worst
so
often,
and
if
the
class
action
had
not
been
alleged
or
if
a
litigant
was
a
member
of
the
--
was
not
a
member
of
the
class.
the
mere
allegation
that
there
was
or
was
not
a
class
should
not
be
held
to
give
to
parties
who
may
or
fall
within
the
designation
of
the
class
on
privilege
status.
when
congress
has
specifically
held
that
section
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act
is
a
barring
statute
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
is
true
because
the
basic
contention
of
the
respondents
and
the
contention
which
essentially
was
adapted
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
section
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act
is
somehow
a
abridge
or
modified
by
rule
23
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
we
would
submit
that
this
is
contrary
to
the
enabling
act,
which
expressly
authorizes
this
court
to
promulgate
the
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure,
but
which
prohibits
such
rules
from
abridging,
enlarging,
or
modifying
any
substance
of
right.
and
of
course,
the
basic
premise
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
of
the
respondents
in
this
action
is
also,
a
contrary
to
the
elementary
and
hornbook
principle
at
court
rules
whatever
they
may
be
are
subject
to
congressional
statute.
the
legislative
history
of
section
5
(b)
clearly
establishes
that,
that
statute
has
a
dual
purpose
to
give
timely
notice
of
the
claims
within
the
periods
stated
by
the
statute
and
the
barring
of
causes
of
action
not
timely
filed.
each
of
these
purposes
is
distorted
by
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
mere
filing
of
a
class
action,
whether
it
is
valid
or
invalid,
doesn't
give
notice
to
defendants
as
to
the
claims
of
members
of
the
class
or
nonclass,
which
will
be
asserted
there
until
members
of
the
class
actually
do
assert
such
claims
prior
thereto
neither
members
of
the
class
nor
their
claims
are
identified.
in
further
end,
if
it
is
under
rule
23,
members
of
the
class
have
the
option
out
of
this
litigation
pursuant
to
rule
23.
now,
and
it
is
particularly
true
that
their
mere
filing
of
the
pleading
bearing
the
label,
the
class
action
doesn't
have
any
meaning,
and
then
afford
any
meaningful
notice,
where
as
in
this
case,
there
have
been
seven
prior
class
actions,
in
which
the
class
has
been
exhaustively
solicited.
now,
the
history
of
this
case
in
the
west
coast
pipe
litigation
establishes
in
very
practical
terms
at
the
purposes
of
the
statute
that
the
filing
of
the
statute
give
notice
to
defendants
just
doesn?t
exist
in
this
case.
in
his
opinion,
judge
pence
pointed
out
that
in
the
west
coast
pipe
cases,
some
300
parties
intervened
and
stated
claims
in
those
seven
prior
class
actions.
in
this
case,
after
the
action
was
filed
by
the
state
of
utah,
no
member
of
the
class
ever
appeared
to
state
their
claims
until
five
months
after
the
limitations
period
and
they
didn't
do
so
even
then,
until
it
was
solicited
by
plaintiff's
counsel
and
plaintiff's
counsel
obtain
relief
from
respondents
separate
boards
resent
such
claims.
and
indeed,
at
that
point,
counsel
for
respondents
stated
to
respondents,
this
in
the
record,
that
the
statute
probably
ran
on
may
24,
1969,
which
was
a
date
some
five
months
prior
at
that
time.
so,
that
interveners
filed
this
motion
was
noticed
that
the
statute
had
ran
as
to
them
and
defendants
never
did
have
notice
of
the
purported
members
of
the
claims
by
over
the
purported
claims
by
members
of
the
class,
until
five
months
after
the
period
prescribed
by
the
statute.
a
case
which
we
believe
comes
close
to
being
on
all
force
with
this
case
is
i.
o'connor
against
anastasia,
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
for
another
point
where
judge
medina,
when
he
was
sitting
on
the
district
court,
with
respect
to
a
fair
labor
standards
acts,
stated
that
in
the
case
where
a
motion
there
and
has
been
like
--
as
in
this
case
was
filed
after
the
statute
had
run.
he
stated
that
defendants
had
no
notice
whatsoever
that
any
claim
was
made
on
behalf
of
any
of
the
claimants
that
is
this
case
exactly,
because
although
no
class
action
was
alleged
here,
in
that
case,
none
exist
in
this
case.
and,
judge
medina
went
on
to
say
it
will
not
suffice.
he's
talking
about
the
issue
of
notice
here,
that
someone
else
has
a
pending
lawsuit
against
the
defendant,
sought
to
be
charge,
in
which
a
similar,
but
different
claim
are
alleged.
the
language
of
house
report
number
422,
eighty-fourth
congress
first
session
of
1955,
we
believe
confirms
a
principle
that
timely
affirmative
notice
by
each
plaintiff
is
required
to
give
defendant's
notice
of
each
claim.
and,
this
appears
from
a
language
of
that
report,
which
states
that
in
cases
where
the
plaintiff's
action
has
been
suspended
by
the
pendency
of
government
antitrust
proceedings,
he
would
be
required
to
bring
his
action,
either
within
the
suspension
period,
i.e.
one
year
after
the
government
suit
had
terminated
or
within
the
four
year
statutes.
this
clearly
stated
requirement
mandates,
we
believe
affirmative
action
by
each
claimant
within
the
statutory
period.
and
any
other
construction
would
make
the
barring
provision
of
the
statute
without
meaning
to
permit
this
intervention,
as
in
this
case,
after
the
barring
period
has
run,
after
the
statute
has
run,
is
tantamount
in
the
equivalent
and
is
identical
to
granting
an
additional
tolling
period.
enacting
5
(b),
congress
clearly
stated
its
intent
to
eliminate
the
very
kind
of
additional
tolling
exceptions
and
extensions,
which
is
a
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals
verdict
in
this
case.
the
report
referred
to
a
private
treble
damage
action,
which
has
been
based
on
the
suit
against
the
motion
picture
industry,
which
was
pending
during
the
40s
by
the
government.
and
stated
that
the
extent
to
which
this
litigation
in
this
case
was
extended
by
virtue
of
various
tolling
provisions
of
federal
law
is
disposed
by
the
following
table
indicating
the
inadvisability
of
prolonging
the
limitation
period
in
such
instances.
while
a
committee
considers
as
highly
desirable
to
toll
the
statutes
of
limitations
during
a
government
antitrust
action
into
grant
plaintiffs
a
reasonable
time
or
after
in
which
to
bring
suit,
it
does
not
believe
that
the
unduly
prolongation
of
proceedings
of
this
type
is
conducive
to
effective
and
efficient
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
law.
and,
thus
if
it
would
clearly
appear
that
the
congressional
policy
is
stated
in
such
report
is
to
eliminate
that
very
kind
of
additional
tolling
periods,
authorized
by
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit.
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
can't
be
squared
with
the
intent
to
eliminate
tolling
extensions
and
exceptions.
and
it
can't
be
squared
with
a
requirement
than
in
a
case
where,
which
is
this
case,
where
the
statute
of
limitations
has
been
suspended
by
the
pendency
of
a
government
antitrust
proceedings,
such
plaintiff
would
be
required
to
bring
his
action
within
one
year
after
the
government
suit
has
terminated.
contrary,
to
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
the
effect
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
if
a
class
action
is
filed,
members
of
the
purported
class
would
be
run
an
additional
tolling
period,
beyond
the
statutory
period,
until
the
court
determines,
whether
the
action
maybe
maintained
as
a
class
action,
in
this
case
it
was
five
months.
in
eisen
against
carlisle,
which
is
now
pending
on
this
court,
pursuant
to
a
writ
of
certiorari,
the
additional
tolling
period
would
have
been
approximately
five
years
and
during
this
period,
under
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
plaintiff's
counsel
is
authorized
by
such
a
thing
to
solicit
class
members
until
a
negative
class
has
been
reached.
at
that
point,
he
has
able
to
bring
motions
on
behalf
of
those
he
solicited
and
that's
what
occurred
in
this
case.
and
this
is
contrary
we
submit
to
the
principle
that
the
power
to
create
tolling
extensions
and
exceptions
is
limited
by
the
general
rule
that
when
a
federal
statute
of
limitations
exist,
such
as
5
(b)
it
access
a
total
bar,
extinguishing
the
right
to
sue.
that
concept
was
stated
by
this
court
in
holmberg
against
armbrecht,
327
us,
at
page
395
in
this
language.
if
congress
explicitly
puts
limits
upon
the
time
for
enforcing
a
right,
which
it
is
created
that
is
amended
on
that
matter.
the
ninth
circuit
stated
the
proposition
in
somewhat
similar
language
with
respect
to
the
statute
of
limitations,
with
respect
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act
that
a
federal
district
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
suit
after
the
statute
of
limitations
is
run.
despite
their
contention,
we
believe
that
respondent's
position,
if
we
understand
the
thrust
of
it
is
that
the
barring
provisions
of
--
and
it
is
the
premise
of
the
opinion
of
court
of
appeals
that
the
barring
provision
of
5
(b)
are
somehow
limited
by
rule
23,
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
we
submit
that
consistent
with
the
intent
of
congress,
the
filing
of
a
class
action
can
have
no
bearing
as
to
whether
claimants
had
satisfied
the
statute
of
limitations.
if
rule
23
affects
the
limitations,
as
stated
in
5
(b)
in
any
respects,
it
constitutes
an
abridgement
of
such
statute
by
rule
of
court.if
the
applicability
of
section
5
(b)
is
dependent
upon
whether
the
class
action
is
alleged
or
found,
it
is
a
capricious
standard,
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
clearly
stated
congressional
intent.and,
as
i
have
stated
earlier,
section
--
the
barring
provisions
of
section
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
yes.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
well,
i
did
not
really
feel
so,
if
the
court
please.
the
event
did
not
seem
to
me
that
mere
language
seem
to
reach
the
question
as
to
whether
the
trial
court,
mr.
justice
brennan,
had
exercised
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
in
all
account,
i
was
somewhat
uncertain
myself,
but
i
thought
that
the
best
view
of
the
court's
opinion
of
the
principal
opinion
by
the
ninth
circuit
was
that
it
was
really
wasn't
reaching
the
issue,
as
to
whether
there
had
been
a
use
of
discretion.
we
argued
that
to
the
ninth
circuit
in
our
briefs
and
in
our
argument.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
i
would
think
it's
mandatory
under
rule
of
24,
except
for
the
somewhat
ambiguous
language
that
you
have
cited,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don't
know
of
any
place
it?s
discussed
except
in
the
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
and,
it
is
my
judgment
that
even
if
the
court
should
disagree
with
our
position,
which
we
think
it
is
basic,
with
respect
to
the
power
of
the
--
with
respect
to
5
(b),
there
is
still
is
a
fetter
on
the
part
of
the
appellate
court,
the
ninth
circuit
to
show
any
or/and
on
the
part
of
respondents
to
show
any
abuse
of
discretion
by
judge
pence,
which
is
a
matter
both
under
the
rules,
if
is
within
his
problems
and
i
suppose
there
is
no
living
person
who
knows
more
about
the
background
of
this
litigation
than
judge
pence
who
had
charge
of
the
350
cases,
which
were
pending
between
1964
and
which
are
pending
even
now,
in
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.
thank
you
your
honor.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
before
this
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
narrow
question
involved
is
the
validity
of
the
order
of
the
trial
court,
denying
intervention
by
respondents
in
an
antitrust
treble-damage
action
based
upon
a
prior
government
action
after
the
running
of
the
pertinent
statute
of
limitations,
section
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act.
before
beginning,
i
should
note
that
i
shall
be
referring
to
the
key
dates,
which
are
pertinent
to
this
statute
of
limitations
question
and
these
key
dates
are
set
forth
in
the
record
appendix,
pages
1
to
4
in
summary
form.
and
i
should
also
indicate
that
the
statutes,
which
we
believe
to
be
pertinent
in
controlling
and
the
rules
of
court,
are
set
forth
in
the
following
six
pages
also
of
the
record
appendix.
as
i
indicated,
this
case
is
based
upon
a
denial
of
a
motion
made
by
respondents
in
the
central
district
of
california.
in
december
1969,
to
intervene
in
an
antitrust
damage
action,
which
have
been
filed
by
the
state
of
utah
on
may
13,
1969
and
has
a
purported
class
action.
the
utah
complaint
alleges
that
the
action
was
based
on
prior
government,
criminal
and
equitable
actions.
and
thus,
by
reasons
of
the
prior
government
actions
and
pursuant
to
the
tolling
provisions
of
sections
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act,
the
state
of
utah
was
able
to
bring
this
action,
based
upon
alleged
acts,
which
entered
in
1962.
the
government
criminal
action
in
which
the
utah
complaint
was
based
was
beyond
march
10,
1964
and
was
terminated
as
to
all
defendants
on
june
19,
1964.
a
separate
government
civil
action
filed
after
the
criminal
action
ended,
it
was
terminated
as
to
all
defendants,
except
american
pipe
and
construction
company
on
december
8,
1967.
with
the
final
judgment
as
to
american
pipe
and
construction
company,
it
wasn?t
filed
until
may
24,
1968
and
as
by
reason
of
this
day
of
may
24,
1968
that
the
trial
court
has
held
at
the
date
of
one
year
later,
may
24,
1969
was
the
date
of
the
statute
of
limitations
finally
ran
in
this
case.
the
district
court
on
december
4,
1969
entered
in
order
that
utah
action
did
not
constitute
a
class
action
and
subsequently,
entered
an
order
made
after
that
denial
of
the
class
action
by
respondents,
the
denying
respondents?
motion
to
intervene.
it
is
this
order
denying
intervention
at
this
juncture,
which
is
a
subject
of
these
appellate
proceedings.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
order
of
the
trial
court
denying
leave
to
intervene
and
held
that
this
suit
was
instituted
on
behalf
of
respondents.
by
the
filing
of
the
utah
complaint
on
may
13,
1969,
even
though
the
prerequisites
to
our
class
action
had
not
been
met
by
the
state
of
utah
and
even
though
respondents
took
no
action,
no
step,
whatsoever
to
intervene,
until
december
19,
1969,
a
date
more
than
five
months
after
the
limitations
period
prescribed
by
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act.
the
narrow
question
involves
therefore,
is
whether
respondents,
who
had
not
filed
suit
within
the
period
prescribed
by
section
5
(b),
were
appropriate
before
the
trial
court
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
the
state
of
utah
erroneously
designated
its
cause
of
action
as
a
class
action,
and
though
this
case
may
appear
to
have
very
superficial,
factual,
or
complexity
of
terms
on
the
very
simple
issue
of
congressional
intent
in
enacting
section
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
yes,
indeed
and
that
is
of
course
as
we
have
planned
out,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
in
connection
with
our
petition
for
certiorari,
this
has
the
effect
as
we
see
it
of
affecting
in
every
federal
statute
of
limitations.
by
the
mere
fact
that
a
class
action
is
typed
on
our
complaint,
even
though
one
does
not
in
fact
exist,
it
has
the
effect
by
virtue
of
the
act
of
a
private
party
of
tolling
the
statute
of
limitations
and
i
would
say
yes
indeed
that
is
indeed
one
of
the
major
issues,
not
only
in
so
far
as
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act
is
concerned,
which
is
pertinent
to
this
case,
but
i
think
the
principle
is
applicable
equally,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
to
every
federal
statute
of
limitation.
i
would
submit
that
the
intent,
in
connection
with
5
(b)
as
to
what
the
statute
really
means
is
clearly
stated
in
the
barring
provision
of
the
statute
and
it
is
also
stated
we
submit
with
some
precision
and
the
legislative
reports
underlying
the
statute.
it
should
first
be
noted
that
the
state
of
utah
is
in
court
only
because
of
5
(b),
which
provides
for
the
suspension
of
the
government
--
of
the
statute
of
limitations
during
the
pendency
of
the
government
antitrust
action
in
which
limits
the
period
--
in
which
the
litigant
may
commence
an
action
based
upon
the
government
suit.
to
the
period
of
the
pendency
over
the
government
civil
or
criminal
action,
and
within
one
year
thereafter,
respondents
did
not
move
within
that
statutory
period
and
were
not
before
the
court,
until
after
the
one
year
suspension
period,
unless
the
filing
of
the
invalid
class
action
by
utah
has
a
legal
effect
of
bringing
respondents
before
the
court.
in
order
to
escape
the
barring
provisions
of
the
clayton
act,
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
via
legal
section
treats
the
respondents
as
if
they
had
filed
suits
simultaneously
with
the
state
of
utah.
however,
factually
it
is
not
with
--
there's
no
dispute
about
this.
they
had
done
nothing
in
any
factual
sense
at
that
time.
they?d
done
nothing
whatsoever
and
they
haven't
brought
an
action
of
their
own
volition
and
they
hadn't
move
to
intervene
and
either
of
these
steps
would
merely
have
required
the
respondents
to
file
a
short
and
plain
statement
of
the
alleged
violations
and
its
purported
impact
upon
the
plaintiff.and
we
submit
that
in
enacting
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act,
the
congress
clearly
intended
to
spell
out
the
requirement
that
each
plaintiff
relying
up
on
section
5
(b)
to
toll
a
statute
of
limitations,
must
take
the
minimal
step
of
stating
its
claim
within
the
period
prescribed
by
the
statute.now,
where
there
is
no
class
action,
of
course
that
would
require
the
filing
of
the
short
and
plain
statement
of
the
claim,
pursuant
to
rule
8
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
but
in
the
case
of
a
--
mr.
justice
white,
of
a
proper
class
action,
we
would
submit
that
it
is
the
legislative
intent
in
enacting
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act
that
each
member
of
the
class
respond
affirmatively
to
the
order
of
the
court
inviting
the
members
of
that
class
to
state
their
claims
and
that
they
do
so
within
the
period
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
legislative
history
--
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
well,
of
course,
you
have
to,
that
is
--
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
no,
to
say
that
pending
the
court's
action
pursuant
to
rule
23,
the
action
is
tolled,
is
to
say
that
rule
23
in
some
manner
abridges
or
modifies
section
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
i
am
saying
that
they
cannot
do
so,
unless
they
affirmatively
--
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
yes,
and
i
would
point
out
however
that
was
in
the
--
this
action
had
--
this
is
not
the
bare
bones,
this
is
not
one
case,
it's
a
series
of
cases
and
practically
there
were
pursuant
at
least
in
seven
prior
class
actions
and
invitations
to
join,
but
forgetting
that
factual
background,
the
fact
is
that
they
did
not
move
to
intervene
at
any
time
within
the
statutory
period
and
i
would
took
some
myth,
that
unless
it
is
held
that
rule
23,
somehow
abridges
or
somehow
modifies,
section
5
(b)
of
clayton
act,
there
is
no
power
in
the
court
to
permit
intervention
after
the
period
of
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
i
would
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
in
the
affirmist,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
think
very
clearly,
it
would
be
possible
to,
within
the
discretionary
realm
of
the
--
that
supported
the
trial
court,
under
rule
of
24
(b)
to
justify
the
acts
of
the
trial
court
tolling,
in
terms
of
the
motion
as
being
clearly
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court.
the
trial
court
by
reason
of
its
knowledge
and
experience
in
the
west
coast
pipe
case
which
have
preceded
and
within
the
framework
at
the
time
that
was
available
through
the
respondents
during
the
period
prior
to
the
running
of
the
statute
and
in
the
framework
of
the
fact
that
the
facts
of
this
case
showed
that
counsel
for
that
is
preparing
on
behalf
of
response
in
this
case,
at
this
time
they
couldn't
study
this
action
for
six
months
and
this
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
suit,
it
was
charge
with
the
problems
of
knowledge
of
the
problems
of
the
statute
of
limitations
growing
out
of
the
prior
litigation.
i
think
in
the
light
of
that
history,
clearly
the
court
is
justified
in
exercising
its
discretion
and
i
think
in
incorporating
its
decision
respecting
the
class
action
in
this
decision
on
the
motions
to
intervene
i
think
the
theory
was
exercising
the
discretion.
your
honor,
it
was
referred
--
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
yes.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
well,
it
was
argued
--
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
in
terms
of
the
briefs
before
the
court
of
appeals.
we
argued
two
points:
(1)
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
the
respondents
to
show
an
abuse
of
the
discretion,
which
had
been
exercised
by
the
trial
court
and
that
we
argued
that
they
had
not
shown
such
an
abuse.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
that
is
correct.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
yes
and
the
--
surprisingly
to
say
that
except
for
the
dissenting
opinion
by
the
ninth
circuit,
the
dissenting
opinion
stated
in
so
many
words
that
was
the
judgment
of
the
court
that
the
trial
court
has
considered
this
and
as
a
matter
of
discretion
and
exercising
that
discretion,
that
discretion
should
be
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
yes,
your
honor.
the
question
was
raised
in
the
--
during
before
the
recess
as
to
whether
members
of
the
purported
class,
court
having
an
intervene
in
the
eleven-day
period,
before
the
statute
of
limitations
run
assuming
there
was
a
valid
class
action.
of
course,
that
is
not
this
case
or
the
trial
court,
specifically
held
and
it
has
not
been
the
subject
of
any
appeal
that
there
is
no
class
action
in
this
case.
but,
i
should
point
out
that
--
well,
that
has
been
found
that
the
members
of
the
nonclass
are
no
worst
so
often,
and
if
the
class
action
had
not
been
alleged
or
if
a
litigant
was
a
member
of
the
--
was
not
a
member
of
the
class.
the
mere
allegation
that
there
was
or
was
not
a
class
should
not
be
held
to
give
to
parties
who
may
or
fall
within
the
designation
of
the
class
on
privilege
status.
when
congress
has
specifically
held
that
section
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act
is
a
barring
statute
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case
that
is
true
because
the
basic
contention
of
the
respondents
and
the
contention
which
essentially
was
adapted
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
section
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act
is
somehow
a
abridge
or
modified
by
rule
23
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
we
would
submit
that
this
is
contrary
to
the
enabling
act,
which
expressly
authorizes
this
court
to
promulgate
the
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure,
but
which
prohibits
such
rules
from
abridging,
enlarging,
or
modifying
any
substance
of
right.
and
of
course,
the
basic
premise
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
of
the
respondents
in
this
action
is
also,
a
contrary
to
the
elementary
and
hornbook
principle
at
court
rules
whatever
they
may
be
are
subject
to
congressional
statute.
the
legislative
history
of
section
5
(b)
clearly
establishes
that,
that
statute
has
a
dual
purpose
to
give
timely
notice
of
the
claims
within
the
periods
stated
by
the
statute
and
the
barring
of
causes
of
action
not
timely
filed.
each
of
these
purposes
is
distorted
by
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
mere
filing
of
a
class
action,
whether
it
is
valid
or
invalid,
doesn't
give
notice
to
defendants
as
to
the
claims
of
members
of
the
class
or
nonclass,
which
will
be
asserted
there
until
members
of
the
class
actually
do
assert
such
claims
prior
thereto
neither
members
of
the
class
nor
their
claims
are
identified.
in
further
end,
if
it
is
under
rule
23,
members
of
the
class
have
the
option
out
of
this
litigation
pursuant
to
rule
23.
now,
and
it
is
particularly
true
that
their
mere
filing
of
the
pleading
bearing
the
label,
the
class
action
doesn't
have
any
meaning,
and
then
afford
any
meaningful
notice,
where
as
in
this
case,
there
have
been
seven
prior
class
actions,
in
which
the
class
has
been
exhaustively
solicited.
now,
the
history
of
this
case
in
the
west
coast
pipe
litigation
establishes
in
very
practical
terms
at
the
purposes
of
the
statute
that
the
filing
of
the
statute
give
notice
to
defendants
just
doesn?t
exist
in
this
case.
in
his
opinion,
judge
pence
pointed
out
that
in
the
west
coast
pipe
cases,
some
300
parties
intervened
and
stated
claims
in
those
seven
prior
class
actions.
in
this
case,
after
the
action
was
filed
by
the
state
of
utah,
no
member
of
the
class
ever
appeared
to
state
their
claims
until
five
months
after
the
limitations
period
and
they
didn't
do
so
even
then,
until
it
was
solicited
by
plaintiff's
counsel
and
plaintiff's
counsel
obtain
relief
from
respondents
separate
boards
resent
such
claims.
and
indeed,
at
that
point,
counsel
for
respondents
stated
to
respondents,
this
in
the
record,
that
the
statute
probably
ran
on
may
24,
1969,
which
was
a
date
some
five
months
prior
at
that
time.
so,
that
interveners
filed
this
motion
was
noticed
that
the
statute
had
ran
as
to
them
and
defendants
never
did
have
notice
of
the
purported
members
of
the
claims
by
over
the
purported
claims
by
members
of
the
class,
until
five
months
after
the
period
prescribed
by
the
statute.
a
case
which
we
believe
comes
close
to
being
on
all
force
with
this
case
is
i.
o'connor
against
anastasia,
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
for
another
point
where
judge
medina,
when
he
was
sitting
on
the
district
court,
with
respect
to
a
fair
labor
standards
acts,
stated
that
in
the
case
where
a
motion
there
and
has
been
like
--
as
in
this
case
was
filed
after
the
statute
had
run.
he
stated
that
defendants
had
no
notice
whatsoever
that
any
claim
was
made
on
behalf
of
any
of
the
claimants
that
is
this
case
exactly,
because
although
no
class
action
was
alleged
here,
in
that
case,
none
exist
in
this
case.
and,
judge
medina
went
on
to
say
it
will
not
suffice.
he's
talking
about
the
issue
of
notice
here,
that
someone
else
has
a
pending
lawsuit
against
the
defendant,
sought
to
be
charge,
in
which
a
similar,
but
different
claim
are
alleged.
the
language
of
house
report
number
422,
eighty-fourth
congress
first
session
of
1955,
we
believe
confirms
a
principle
that
timely
affirmative
notice
by
each
plaintiff
is
required
to
give
defendant's
notice
of
each
claim.
and,
this
appears
from
a
language
of
that
report,
which
states
that
in
cases
where
the
plaintiff's
action
has
been
suspended
by
the
pendency
of
government
antitrust
proceedings,
he
would
be
required
to
bring
his
action,
either
within
the
suspension
period,
i.e.
one
year
after
the
government
suit
had
terminated
or
within
the
four
year
statutes.
this
clearly
stated
requirement
mandates,
we
believe
affirmative
action
by
each
claimant
within
the
statutory
period.
and
any
other
construction
would
make
the
barring
provision
of
the
statute
without
meaning
to
permit
this
intervention,
as
in
this
case,
after
the
barring
period
has
run,
after
the
statute
has
run,
is
tantamount
in
the
equivalent
and
is
identical
to
granting
an
additional
tolling
period.
enacting
5
(b),
congress
clearly
stated
its
intent
to
eliminate
the
very
kind
of
additional
tolling
exceptions
and
extensions,
which
is
a
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals
verdict
in
this
case.
the
report
referred
to
a
private
treble
damage
action,
which
has
been
based
on
the
suit
against
the
motion
picture
industry,
which
was
pending
during
the
40s
by
the
government.
and
stated
that
the
extent
to
which
this
litigation
in
this
case
was
extended
by
virtue
of
various
tolling
provisions
of
federal
law
is
disposed
by
the
following
table
indicating
the
inadvisability
of
prolonging
the
limitation
period
in
such
instances.
while
a
committee
considers
as
highly
desirable
to
toll
the
statutes
of
limitations
during
a
government
antitrust
action
into
grant
plaintiffs
a
reasonable
time
or
after
in
which
to
bring
suit,
it
does
not
believe
that
the
unduly
prolongation
of
proceedings
of
this
type
is
conducive
to
effective
and
efficient
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
law.
and,
thus
if
it
would
clearly
appear
that
the
congressional
policy
is
stated
in
such
report
is
to
eliminate
that
very
kind
of
additional
tolling
periods,
authorized
by
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit.
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
can't
be
squared
with
the
intent
to
eliminate
tolling
extensions
and
exceptions.
and
it
can't
be
squared
with
a
requirement
than
in
a
case
where,
which
is
this
case,
where
the
statute
of
limitations
has
been
suspended
by
the
pendency
of
a
government
antitrust
proceedings,
such
plaintiff
would
be
required
to
bring
his
action
within
one
year
after
the
government
suit
has
terminated.
contrary,
to
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
the
effect
of
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
if
a
class
action
is
filed,
members
of
the
purported
class
would
be
run
an
additional
tolling
period,
beyond
the
statutory
period,
until
the
court
determines,
whether
the
action
maybe
maintained
as
a
class
action,
in
this
case
it
was
five
months.
in
eisen
against
carlisle,
which
is
now
pending
on
this
court,
pursuant
to
a
writ
of
certiorari,
the
additional
tolling
period
would
have
been
approximately
five
years
and
during
this
period,
under
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
plaintiff's
counsel
is
authorized
by
such
a
thing
to
solicit
class
members
until
a
negative
class
has
been
reached.
at
that
point,
he
has
able
to
bring
motions
on
behalf
of
those
he
solicited
and
that's
what
occurred
in
this
case.
and
this
is
contrary
we
submit
to
the
principle
that
the
power
to
create
tolling
extensions
and
exceptions
is
limited
by
the
general
rule
that
when
a
federal
statute
of
limitations
exist,
such
as
5
(b)
it
access
a
total
bar,
extinguishing
the
right
to
sue.
that
concept
was
stated
by
this
court
in
holmberg
against
armbrecht,
327
us,
at
page
395
in
this
language.
if
congress
explicitly
puts
limits
upon
the
time
for
enforcing
a
right,
which
it
is
created
that
is
amended
on
that
matter.
the
ninth
circuit
stated
the
proposition
in
somewhat
similar
language
with
respect
to
the
statute
of
limitations,
with
respect
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act
that
a
federal
district
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
suit
after
the
statute
of
limitations
is
run.
despite
their
contention,
we
believe
that
respondent's
position,
if
we
understand
the
thrust
of
it
is
that
the
barring
provisions
of
--
and
it
is
the
premise
of
the
opinion
of
court
of
appeals
that
the
barring
provision
of
5
(b)
are
somehow
limited
by
rule
23,
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure.
we
submit
that
consistent
with
the
intent
of
congress,
the
filing
of
a
class
action
can
have
no
bearing
as
to
whether
claimants
had
satisfied
the
statute
of
limitations.
if
rule
23
affects
the
limitations,
as
stated
in
5
(b)
in
any
respects,
it
constitutes
an
abridgement
of
such
statute
by
rule
of
court.if
the
applicability
of
section
5
(b)
is
dependent
upon
whether
the
class
action
is
alleged
or
found,
it
is
a
capricious
standard,
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
clearly
stated
congressional
intent.and,
as
i
have
stated
earlier,
section
--
the
barring
provisions
of
section
5
(b)
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
yes.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
well,
i
did
not
really
feel
so,
if
the
court
please.
the
event
did
not
seem
to
me
that
mere
language
seem
to
reach
the
question
as
to
whether
the
trial
court,
mr.
justice
brennan,
had
exercised
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
in
all
account,
i
was
somewhat
uncertain
myself,
but
i
thought
that
the
best
view
of
the
court's
opinion
of
the
principal
opinion
by
the
ninth
circuit
was
that
it
was
really
wasn't
reaching
the
issue,
as
to
whether
there
had
been
a
use
of
discretion.
we
argued
that
to
the
ninth
circuit
in
our
briefs
and
in
our
argument.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
i
would
think
it's
mandatory
under
rule
of
24,
except
for
the
somewhat
ambiguous
language
that
you
have
cited,
mr.
justice
brennan,
i
don't
know
of
any
place
it?s
discussed
except
in
the
dissenting
opinion.
mr.
jesse
r.
o'malley
yes,
i
do
your
honor.
and,
it
is
my
judgment
that
even
if
the
court
should
disagree
with
our
position,
which
we
think
it
is
basic,
with
respect
to
the
power
of
the
--
with
respect
to
5
(b),
there
is
still
is
a
fetter
on
the
part
of
the
appellate
court,
the
ninth
circuit
to
show
any
or/and
on
the
part
of
respondents
to
show
any
abuse
of
discretion
by
judge
pence,
which
is
a
matter
both
under
the
rules,
if
is
within
his
problems
and
i
suppose
there
is
no
living
person
who
knows
more
about
the
background
of
this
litigation
than
judge
pence
who
had
charge
of
the
350
cases,
which
were
pending
between
1964
and
which
are
pending
even
now,
in
so
far
as
this
case
is
concerned.
thank
you
your
honor.
