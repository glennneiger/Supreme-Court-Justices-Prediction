in
the
chavez
case,
the
attorney
general
himself
approved
the
application,
but
the
application
mistakenly
identified
the
officer
who
actually
had
approved
the
application.
this
procedure
also
did
not
comply
with
the
act,
but
in
this
case,
we
think
that
the
evidence
obtained
from
a
wiretap,
under
section
order,
is
admissible
in
evidence.
here,
different
from
the
giordano
case,
the
officer,
required
by
the
act
to
approve
the
application,
actually
did
approve
the
application.
and
the
mistake
in
identification
was
not
the
kind
of
a
default
which
we
think
under
the
terms
of
the
act
requires
the
exclusion
of
the
evidence.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
had
arrived
with
the
opposite
conclusion
in
this
respect,
and
so
we
reverse
their
judgment.
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
judgment
in
which
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
