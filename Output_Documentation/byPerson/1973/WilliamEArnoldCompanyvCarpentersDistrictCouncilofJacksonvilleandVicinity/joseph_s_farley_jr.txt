mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
in
complete
agreement
with
mr.
jones
as
to
we
all
would
like
to
have
uniformity
in
the
federal
labor
law.
the
problem
that
this
case
presents
is
that
you
have
two
relatively
well
gone
over
doctrines
in
the
federal
labor
law
that
are
presented
in
this
case.
the
first
is
the
doctrine
of
federal
preemption
over
unfair
labor
practices.
the
garmon
doctrine,
garner,
weber
decisions
saying
that
if
a
case
presents
a
dispute
that
is
arguably
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
a
protected
activity
under
the
act
that
the
federal
government
has
preempted
the
area
and
that
state
courts
should
defer
to
the
federal
jurisdiction.
then
in
this
particular
case,
you
also
have
the
question
of
the
norris-la
guardia
act
and
the
prohibition
on
federal
courts
of
issuing
injunctions
in
labor
disputes.
the
florida
supreme
court
held
essentially
that
the
fact
that
a
contract
is
involved
does
not
remove
the
prohibitions
of
preemption
that
the
federal
government
has
placed
upon
the
states.
that
this
area
of
the
law,
the
injunction
in
a
labor
law
dispute
is
sufficiently
of
national
concern
and
national
interest
that
the
state
courts
should
defer
at
least
initial
jurisdiction
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
when
injunctive
relief
is
what
is
requested
and
when
it
is
concededly
an
unfair
labor
practice
involved.
our
position
is
simply
that
if
state
courts
would
follow
this
position,
you
would
have
your
uniformity
in
your
federal
labor
law.
there's
nothing
to
prevent
the
company
if
they
feel
--
if
they
feel
as
though
a
no-strike
provision
has
been
breached
from
going
into
federal
court.
there's
nothing
to
prevent
the
company
if
they
feel
an
unfair
labor
practices
being
practiced
upon
them
to
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
there's
nothing
in
the
world
preventing
the
national
labor
relations
board
from
doing
something
about
it.
that’s
the
whole
purpose
for
which
they
were
setup.
they
have
the
machinery
to
acquire
injunctions.
they
have
the
machinery
to
issue
cease
and
desist
orders
against
activities
like
this.
this
area
of
the
law
has
long
been
within
the
federal
curtilage
and
jurisdiction,
although
it
might
also
have
been
somewhat
within
the
state
jurisdiction.
the
states
haven’t
known
what
to
do
because
the
federal
law
is
always
changing
with
the
times
to
keep
up
with
the
situations
that
arise
in
labor
disputes.
and
our
position
--
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
but
i
would
point
that
this
court
has
held
long
before
now
that
state
court
is
entertaining
301
suits
are
bound
by
federal
law.
but
i
think
its
fairly
clear
that
doesn’t
happen
all
the
time
when
you
got
50
states
with
numerous
lower
level
trial
courts
coming
in
and
accepting
jurisdiction
and
--
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
well,
i
don’t
know,
there's
20
in
jacksonville--
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
presumably
and
hopefully,
each
one
with
roughly
the
same
opinion,
but
again
as
it
turns
out
--
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
just
in
the
reasoning
behind
garmon
with
so
many
different
--
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
exactly
your
honor,
exactly
and
i
don’t
think
that
there's
any
question
but
this
is
the
case.
and
i
think
that
its
just
with
the
federal
machinery
that
is
setup
particularly
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
with
this
court’s
holding
in
boys
market
making
it
obvious
how
important
the
injunction
is
in
federal
labor
law
that
you
should
allow
all
the
trial
courts
in
the
different
states
to
try
and
interpret
the
law.
that
because
the
labor
injunction
is
of
national
concern,
that
outweighs
the
consideration
that
a
contract
was
also
involved
and
is
sufficient
reason
to
employ
the
garmon
doctrine
of
federal
preemption.
especially
in
this
case
where
there
is
concededly
an
unfair
labor
practice
involved.
especially
in
this
case
where
at
least
in
my
opinion
there
is
not
a
binding
arbitration
clause.
there’s
no
provision
whatsoever
for
arbitration
and
i’m
not
sure
that
there
is
actually
an
agreement
as
to
what
is
going
to
be
binding
upon
the
parties
and
of
course
then
you
have
a
problem
with
the
labor
union,
it
wasn’t
even
a
part
of
this
contract.
the
record
unfortunately
is
silent
as
to
what
procedures
were
taken
by
either
the
union
involved
here,
the
carpenters
union
or
the
company
to
attempt
to
follow
the
grievance
procedure
that
was
somewhat
set
out
in
the
contract.
there
was
no
transcript
made
of
the
hearing
and
it’s
unclear
whether
the
lathers'
union
was
unwilling
to
follow
this
procedure,
whether
the
company
was
unwilling
to
--
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
but
my
position
is
that
the
florida
supreme
court
held
exactly
foursquare
with
weber
and
with
garmon.
and
in
attempting
to
keep
the
law
uniform,
the
federal
labor
law
uniform,
they
followed
what
the
united
states
supreme
court
said
in
those
cases.
they
followed
it
very
strictly
that
if
arguably
you
have
the
unfair
labor
practice
then
the
state
court
should
defer
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
only
to
the
extent
that
you
also
have
the
question
of
the
contractual
agreement
and
if
you
get
into
boys
market,
the
area
of
injunctive
relief
which
this
court
with
this
case
did
present
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
they
had
been
concerned
in
prior
cases
with
the
issuing
of
ex
parte
injunctions
in
labor
disputes.
it
becomes
important
as
to
what
went
on
because
of
boys
market
saying
that
there
must
be
--
for
the
federal
courts
anyway
to
enjoin
an
activity,
there
must
be
the
binding
arbitration
procedure.
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
wasn’t
trying
to
imply
that
it
would.
i
understand
that
if
the
court
--
if
the
state
court
had
jurisdiction
of
this
matter,
it
doesn’t
make
it.
that’s
the
question
that
we
have
here.
not
whether
it
wrongfully
or
rightfully
enjoined
if
it
had
jurisdiction,
but
rather
does
it
have
jurisdiction.
i
believe
it
was
the
attorney
general
that
brought
in
their
memorandum
to
the
court,
brought
up
the
question
of
abstention
of
state
courts.
i
don’t
really
see
a
big
distinction
between
the
florida
supreme
court
saying
we
are
going
to
abstain
--
we
are
going
to
defer
our
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
well,
they
--
not
in
this
case.
they
didn’t
say
they
were
deferring.
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
right.
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
well,
but
the
way
they
phrased
it
in
the
prior
case,
i
believe
it
was
sheet
metal,
but
it
might
have
been
scherer
that
state
court
--
that
the
state
court
should
defer
initial
jurisdiction
--
should
defer
jurisdiction
at
least
to
the
point
of
letting
the
national
labor
relations
board
make
the
initial
decision
as
to
federal
jurisdiction.
it
maybe
that
the
florida
supreme
court
was
taking
a
position
of
deferring
in
and
abstaining
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
that
was
--
my
reading
of
their
opinion
was
that
they
would
be
happy
to
take
jurisdiction
of
the
case
if
the
national
labor
relations
board
did
not
feel
it
came
within
the
federal
preemption
doctrine
or
it
came
under
the
national
labor
relations
board
jurisdiction.
they
didn’t
say
flat
out
we’re
not
going
to
take
jurisdiction
of
cases
that
arguably
come
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
they
just
said
initially,
they
would
prefer
in
the
interest
of
uniformity
to
have
the
national
labor
relations
board
make
a
decision.
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
that
i
tried
to
point
out
in
my
brief
that
regardless
of
the
dictum
that
the
florida
supreme
court
threw
out
that
the
case
that
they
decided
was
a
case
for
injunctive
relief
that
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
alleged
in
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and
that
they
decided
that
in
that
situation
where
there's
no
binding
arbitration
clause
at
least
the
way
i
read
it,
that
the
state
court
should
not
utilize
its
jurisdiction,
it
should
defer
jurisdiction.
and
again
to
repeat,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
best
way
to
ensure
national
uniformity
in
our
federal
labor
law
and
relations
and
especially
in
the
area
of
unfair
labor
practices
and
injunctive
relief
is
to
allow
the
state
courts
to
defer
to
the
federal
courts
or
the
national
labor
relations
board.
congress
has
set
out
what
the
unfair
labor
practices
are.
congress
determined
that
a
national
agency
should
oversee
and
should
try
and
curtail
and
prevent
these
unfair
labor
practices.
this
court
has
been
very
definitive
in
--
under
what
situations
the
district
courts
could
grant
injunctive
relief.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
injunction
is
of
such
interest
to
congress
and
to
the
federal
labor
law
that
they
would
pass
a
law,
the
norris-la
guardia
act,
prohibiting
the
district
courts
from
granting
injunctive
relief,
then
that
i
think
is
a
national
policy
that
represents
the
national
policy
of
being
very
careful
under
what
situations
you
grant
injunctive
relief.
now,
i
don’t
see
any
sense
at
all
in
having
one
layer
of
law,
one
pathway
of
law
being
the
federal
law
saying
only
under
these
circumstances
can
injunctive
relief
be
granted
in
the
federal
court,
but
under
any
all
circumstances,
they
can
be
granted
in
the
state
courts.
that’s
just
not
in
the
interest
of
the
national
uniform
labor
policy.
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
well,
i
don’t
know
that
this
is
a
case
where
this
court
could
extend
the
language
of
the
norris-la
guardia
act
to
state
courts.
i
will
point
out
though
that
in
boys
market,
this
court
noted
that
a
good
number
of
the
states
already
have
anti
injunction
statute
so
that
you
got
sort
of
a
hodgepodge
anyway
with
the
state
courts.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
to
allow
state
courts,
as
this
one
did,
to
defer
to
the
federal
jurisdiction
would
be
better
than
allowing
50
states
to
go
in
50
different
ways
on
federal
injunction
labor
law.
i
don’t
know
--
on
the
face
of
it,
your
contractual
question;
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
florida
supreme
court’s
decision
and
the
decision
in
smith
v.
evening
news.
but
to
say
that
it
is
such
a
conflict
that
we're
going
to
just
throw
out
to
all
the
50
states
the
question
of
federal
injunctive
relief
and
let
them
decide
at
it
as
they
may,
i
think
that
the
latter
is
more
important
and
that
the
contractual
question
should
yield
to
the
federal
preemption
doctrine
in
this
situation.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
in
complete
agreement
with
mr.
jones
as
to
we
all
would
like
to
have
uniformity
in
the
federal
labor
law.
the
problem
that
this
case
presents
is
that
you
have
two
relatively
well
gone
over
doctrines
in
the
federal
labor
law
that
are
presented
in
this
case.
the
first
is
the
doctrine
of
federal
preemption
over
unfair
labor
practices.
the
garmon
doctrine,
garner,
weber
decisions
saying
that
if
a
case
presents
a
dispute
that
is
arguably
an
unfair
labor
practice
or
a
protected
activity
under
the
act
that
the
federal
government
has
preempted
the
area
and
that
state
courts
should
defer
to
the
federal
jurisdiction.
then
in
this
particular
case,
you
also
have
the
question
of
the
norris-la
guardia
act
and
the
prohibition
on
federal
courts
of
issuing
injunctions
in
labor
disputes.
the
florida
supreme
court
held
essentially
that
the
fact
that
a
contract
is
involved
does
not
remove
the
prohibitions
of
preemption
that
the
federal
government
has
placed
upon
the
states.
that
this
area
of
the
law,
the
injunction
in
a
labor
law
dispute
is
sufficiently
of
national
concern
and
national
interest
that
the
state
courts
should
defer
at
least
initial
jurisdiction
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
when
injunctive
relief
is
what
is
requested
and
when
it
is
concededly
an
unfair
labor
practice
involved.
our
position
is
simply
that
if
state
courts
would
follow
this
position,
you
would
have
your
uniformity
in
your
federal
labor
law.
there's
nothing
to
prevent
the
company
if
they
feel
--
if
they
feel
as
though
a
no-strike
provision
has
been
breached
from
going
into
federal
court.
there's
nothing
to
prevent
the
company
if
they
feel
an
unfair
labor
practices
being
practiced
upon
them
to
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
there's
nothing
in
the
world
preventing
the
national
labor
relations
board
from
doing
something
about
it.
that’s
the
whole
purpose
for
which
they
were
setup.
they
have
the
machinery
to
acquire
injunctions.
they
have
the
machinery
to
issue
cease
and
desist
orders
against
activities
like
this.
this
area
of
the
law
has
long
been
within
the
federal
curtilage
and
jurisdiction,
although
it
might
also
have
been
somewhat
within
the
state
jurisdiction.
the
states
haven’t
known
what
to
do
because
the
federal
law
is
always
changing
with
the
times
to
keep
up
with
the
situations
that
arise
in
labor
disputes.
and
our
position
--
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
but
i
would
point
that
this
court
has
held
long
before
now
that
state
court
is
entertaining
301
suits
are
bound
by
federal
law.
but
i
think
its
fairly
clear
that
doesn’t
happen
all
the
time
when
you
got
50
states
with
numerous
lower
level
trial
courts
coming
in
and
accepting
jurisdiction
and
--
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
well,
i
don’t
know,
there's
20
in
jacksonville--
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
presumably
and
hopefully,
each
one
with
roughly
the
same
opinion,
but
again
as
it
turns
out
--
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
just
in
the
reasoning
behind
garmon
with
so
many
different
--
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
exactly
your
honor,
exactly
and
i
don’t
think
that
there's
any
question
but
this
is
the
case.
and
i
think
that
its
just
with
the
federal
machinery
that
is
setup
particularly
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
with
this
court’s
holding
in
boys

that

to
try

the
law.
that
because
the
labor
injunction
is
of
national
concern,
that
outweighs
the
consideration
that
a
contract
was
also
involved
and
is
sufficient
reason
to
employ
the
garmon
doctrine
of
federal
preemption.
especially
in
this
case
where
there
is
concededly
an
unfair
labor
practice
involved.
especially
in
this
case
where
at
least
in
my
opinion
there
is
not
a
binding
arbitration
clause.
there’s
no
provision
whatsoever
for
arbitration
and
i’m
not
sure
that
there
is
actually
an
agreement
as
to
what
is
going
to
be
binding
upon
the
parties
and
of

then
you
have
a

with
the
labor

honor.
but
my
position
is
that
the
florida
supreme
court
held
exactly
foursquare
with
weber
and
with
garmon.
and
in
attempting
to
keep
the
law
uniform,
the
federal
labor
law
uniform,
they
followed
what
the
united
states
supreme
court
said
in
those
cases.
they
followed
it
very
strictly
that
if
arguably
you
have
the
unfair
labor
practice
then
the
state
court
should
defer
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
only
to
the
extent
that
you
also
have
the
question
of
the
contractual
agreement
and
if
you
get
into
boys
market,
the
area
of
injunctive
relief
which
this
court
with
this
case
did
present
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
they
had
been
concerned
in
prior
cases
with
the
issuing
of
ex
parte
injunctions
in
labor
disputes.
it
becomes
important
as
to
what
went
on
because
of
boys
market
saying
that
there
must
be
--
for
the
federal
courts
anyway
to
enjoin
an
activity,
there
must
be
the
binding
arbitration
procedure.
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
wasn’t
trying
to
imply
that
it
would.
i
understand
that
if
the
court
--
if
the
state
court
had
jurisdiction
of
this
matter,
it
doesn’t
make
it.
that’s
the
question
that
we
have
here.
not
whether
it
wrongfully
or
rightfully
enjoined
if
it
had
jurisdiction,
but
rather
does
it
have
jurisdiction.
i
believe
it
was
the
attorney
general
that
brought
in
their
memorandum
to
the
court,
brought
up
the
question
of
abstention
of
state
courts.
i
don’t
really
see
a
big
distinction
between
the
florida
supreme
court
saying
we
are
going
to
abstain
--
we
are
going
to
defer
our
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
well,
they
--
not
in
this
case.
they
didn’t
say
they
were
deferring.
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
right.
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
well,
but
the
way
they
phrased
it
in
the
prior
case,
i
believe
it
was
sheet
metal,
but
it
might
have
been
scherer
that
state
court
--
that
the
state
court
should
defer
initial
jurisdiction
--
should
defer
jurisdiction
at
least
to
the
point
of
letting
the
national
labor
relations
board
make
the
initial
decision
as
to
federal
jurisdiction.
it
maybe
that
the
florida
supreme
court
was
taking
a
position
of
deferring
in
and
abstaining
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
that
was
--
my
reading
of
their
opinion
was
that
they
would
be
happy
to
take
jurisdiction
of
the
case
if
the
national
labor
relations
board
did
not
feel
it
came
within
the
federal
preemption
doctrine
or
it
came
under
the
national
labor
relations
board
jurisdiction.
they
didn’t
say
flat
out
we’re
not
going
to
take
jurisdiction
of
cases
that
arguably
come
under
the
taft-hartley
act.
they
just
said
initially,
they
would
prefer
in
the
interest
of
uniformity
to
have
the
national
labor
relations
board
make
a
decision.
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
that
i
tried
to
point
out
in
my
brief
that
regardless
of
the
dictum
that
the
florida
supreme
court
threw
out
that
the
case
that
they
decided
was
a
case
for
injunctive
relief
that
on
the
face
of
the
complaint
alleged
in
an
unfair
labor
practice.
and
that
they
decided
that
in
that
situation
where
there's
no
binding
arbitration
clause
at
least
the
way
i
read
it,
that
the
state
court
should
not
utilize
its
jurisdiction,
it
should
defer
jurisdiction.
and
again
to
repeat,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
best
way
to
ensure
national
uniformity
in
our
federal
labor
law
and
relations
and
especially
in
the
area
of
unfair
labor
practices
and
injunctive
relief
is
to
allow
the
state
courts
to
defer
to
the
federal
courts
or
the
national
labor
relations
board.
congress
has
set
out
what
the
unfair
labor
practices
are.
congress
determined
that
a
national
agency
should
oversee
and
should
try
and
curtail
and
prevent
these
unfair
labor
practices.
this
court
has
been
very
definitive
in
--
under
what
situations
the
district
courts
could
grant
injunctive
relief.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
injunction
is
of
such
interest
to
congress
and
to
the
federal
labor
law
that
they
would
pass
a
law,
the
norris-la
guardia
act,
prohibiting
the
district
courts
from
granting
injunctive
relief,
then
that
i
think
is
a
national
policy
that
represents
the
national
policy
of
being
very
careful
under
what
situations
you
grant
injunctive
relief.
now,
i
don’t
see
any
sense
at
all
in
having
one
layer
of
law,
one
pathway
of
law
being
the
federal
law
saying
only
under
these
circumstances
can
injunctive
relief
be
granted
in
the
federal
court,
but
under
any
all
circumstances,
they
can
be
granted
in
the
state
courts.
that’s
just
not
in
the
interest
of
the
national
uniform
labor
policy.
mr.
joseph
s.
farley,
jr.
well,
i
don’t
know
that
this
is
a
case
where
this
court
could
extend
the
language
of
the
norris-la
guardia
act
to
state
courts.
i
will
point
out
though
that
in
boys
market,
this
court
noted
that
a
good
number
of
the
states
already
have
anti
injunction
statute
so
that
you
got
sort
of
a
hodgepodge
anyway
with
the
state
courts.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
to
allow
state
courts,
as
this
one
did,
to
defer
to
the
federal
jurisdiction
would
be
better
than
allowing
50
states
to
go
in
50
different
ways
on
federal
injunction
labor
law.
i
don’t
know
--
on
the
face
of
it,
your
contractual
question;
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
florida
supreme
court’s
decision
and
the
decision
in
smith
v.
evening
news.
but
to
say
that
it
is
such
a
conflict
that
we're
going
to
just
throw
out
to
all
the
50
states
the
question
of
federal
injunctive
relief
and
let
them
decide
at
it
as
they
may,
i
think
that
the
latter
is
more
important
and
that
the
contractual
question
should
yield
to
the
federal
preemption
doctrine
in
this
situation.
thank
you.
