mr.

is
it
necessary

result?
chief

well
this
would
have
to
be
a
general
jurisdiction
court
in

would
it
not?
chief

that’s
not
very
low

chief

e.

50

75
state

judges.
what
is
the
--
how
does
the
number
enter
into
it?
chief

isn't
your
emphasis
really
they
aren't

as
the
district
--
federal
district
judges
at

presumed
to
be?
chief

didn’t
say
deferring
that,
did
they?
chief

warren
e.

so
deferring,
have
any?
chief

so
there
is
no

i
am
reading
the
correct
opinion,
judge

the

is,
“we
hold
that
the
district
court
erred
in
failing
to
prohibit
the
further
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
the
circuit
court.”
that
does
have
some
overtones
of
what
you
suggested
perhaps,
but
further
exercise
