that
was
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
a
301
suit
in
state
case,
was
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
would
this
be
met
do
you
think
that
simply
by
holding
applicable
or
pertinent
federal
law
as
to
govern
the
state
court
determination?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
that
is
the
federal
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
federal
law
would
produce
that
result
and
the
state
courts
may
apply
federal
laws
as
i
understand?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
is
a
jurisdictional
dispute
in
this
case,
isn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
is
it
--
let’s
see,
i
have
forgotten,
it
is
an
arbitration
provision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
this
is
mandatorily
mis
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
an
arbitration
procedure
--
mandatory
arbitration
procedure?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
we’re
not
--
we
don’t
have
in
this
case
at
least
the
situation
you're
addressing
now,
do
we
--
of
simply
a
no-strike
clause
without
an
arbitration
provision?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
you
nevertheless
are
asking
us
to
decide
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
guess
somebody
left
it
open
rather
purposely
i
thought
in
boys
market?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
limited
--
we
said
that
the
boys
market
decision
dealt
narrowly
with
the
question
of
enjoinability
of
a
strike
in
the
situation
where
there
was
an
arbitration
provision
for
handling
the
grievance,
which
provoked
the
strike?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
to
go
beyond
that.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
one
of
those
conditions,
was
it
not,
was
that
they
determine
whether
or
not
it
was
an
arbitrable
grievance.
was
that
in
the
sinclair
dissent?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it
had
to
be
over
a
grievance,
which
both
parties
are
contractually
bound
to
arbitrate?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
but
it
may
be
that
the
whole
underlying
premise
of
boys
markets
was
that
you
may
enjoin
violation
of
a
no-strike
provision
only
if
there
is
a
compulsory
arbitration
provision
applicable
to
the
grievance
which
provokes
the
strike.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

yes.

the
second
case,
73-466,
arnold
company
versus
the
carpenters
union.
in
this
case
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
the
florida
courts
were
not
empowered
to
exercise
jurisdiction
and
a
suit
by
an
employer
to
enjoin
a
strike
by
a
union
over
a
grievance
that
was
arbitrable
under
the
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
strike,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said,
was
arguably
also
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
therefore
the
state
supreme
court
held
it
in
that
circumstance
remedy
for
the
breach
was
exclusively
a
matter
for
decision
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
we
disagree.
in
a
long
series
of
cases
we
had
emphasized
that
the
congress
in
enacting
section
301
of
the
part
of
the
amendments
intended
that
state
and
federal
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
enforce
collective
bargaining
contracts
providing
for
arbitration
to
grievances
and
to
enjoin
strikes
over
such
grievances,
even
if
the
strikes,
by
arguably,
also
constitute
unfair
labor
practice.
we,
therefore,
unanimously
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
florida
supreme
court.
