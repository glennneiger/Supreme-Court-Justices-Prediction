justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jones,
is
that
really
before
us?
my
understanding
is
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
issued
a
writ
of
prohibition
saying
that
whatever
standards
might
apply
to
the
florida
state
courts
in
enforcing
a
301
action
if
they
had
jurisdiction,
they
were
simply
preempted
by
the
national
act
and
they
didn’t
pass
and
the
district
court
of
appeal
didn’t
pass
on
what
standards
would
guide
them
if
they
had
the
right
to
entertain
this
suit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jones,
wouldn’t
you
contend
that
once
you
get
to
the
end
of
the
preemption
issue
that
if
there
is
no
preemption
here,
the
state
court
has
jurisdiction
to
decide
as
the
chief
justice
says
whether
there
was
a
binding
no-strike
clause
of
binding
arbitration
clause
and
decide
whether
that
is
required
by
the
law?
i
mean,
all
--
what
you're
appealing
from
is
the
decision
of
your
highest
state
supreme
court
that
said
the
circuit
court
of
duval
county
can’t
even
entertain
an
action
like
this,
not
how
to
decide
it
on
the
merits
once
it’s
entertained?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
circuit
court
has
jurisdiction,
if
it
isn't
preempted
by
garmon,
then
i
take
it
that
it
has
a
right
to
issue
an
injunction
erroneously
under
boys
market
as
well
to
issue
an
injunction
correctly
under
boys
market.
there
was
an
intonation
in
the
district
court
of
appeal
decision
that
maybe
the
judge
writing
the
opinion
for
the
district
court
of
appeal
thought
that
the
circuit
court
had
made
the
wrong
decision,
but
that
that
didn’t
deprive
them
of
jurisdiction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
what
you're
defending
here
is
the
decision
of
your
supreme
court
that
says
the
circuit
court
in
jacksonville
can’t
even
inquire
into
these
issues,
that
they
simply
have
no
jurisdiction
to
look
into
the
things
that
you're
talking
about?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
the
kind
of
facts
that
you
are
just
mentioning
whether
the
lathers
did
this
or
did
that
really
don’t
bear
on
the
jurisdiction
with,
do
they?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
but
supposing
that
that
is
the
rule
of
boys
market
and
supposing
you're
wrong
on
your
garmon
point
that
the
circuit
court
in
duval
county
has
jurisdiction
to
entertain
this
action,
but
it
must
follow
boys
market
and
that’s
the
rule
of
boys
market.
the
fact
that
it
may
have
wrongly
issued
an
injunction
in
this
particular
case
wouldn’t
support
what
the
supreme
court
of
florida
did
here
because
they
said
it
had
no
business
even
inquiring
into
this
subject?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
--
what
do
you
do
about
the
limitation
and
the
language
of
the
law
in
norris-la
guardia
act
that
says
it
applies
to
courts
of
the
united
states
and
certainly
intimates
it
doesn’t
apply
to
state
courts?
