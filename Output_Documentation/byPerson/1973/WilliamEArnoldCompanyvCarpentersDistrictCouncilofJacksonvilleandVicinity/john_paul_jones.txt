mr.
john
paul
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
before
you
is
a
case
involving
a
state
court's
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
the
violation
of
a
no-strike
promise
by
a
union.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
general
contractor
and
for
purposes
of
clarity
and
keeping
the
party
straight,
i'll
refer
it
to
the
william
e.
arnold
company
petitioner
in
this
case
as
company.
the
company
and
the
union
had
an
agreement,
which
provided
that
there
would
be
no
strikes
over
a
jurisdictional
dispute.
the
general
contractor,
the
company’s
subcontractor
who
had
a
contract
with
another
union
pursuant
to
that
agreement
assigned
certain
work
to
this
other
union.
the
respondents
here,
the
union,
then
struck
in
violation
of
the
no-strike
clause,
which
also
provided
that
the
grievance
arbitration
procedure
of
the
national
joint
board
would
obtain
in
any
disputes
over
jurisdictional
dispute.
the
company
then
filed
an
action
in
the
state
court
for
a
temporary
restraining
order,
which
was
granted
after
a
notice
to
the
union’s
attorney
and
after
the
preemption
doctrines
had
been
argued
before
the
state
judge.
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
issued
enjoining
the
union
from
further
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
union
then
filed
a
suggestion
for
writ
of
prohibition
in
the
first
district
court
of
appeal
and
state
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
paul
jones
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan
it
was.
it
was
not
denominated
as
such
in
the
pleadings,
but
it
was
in
301.
the
suggestion
for
writ
of
prohibition
was
filed
in
the
first
district
on
the
basis
that
the
garmon
doctrine
as
it
had
been
enunciated
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
both
the
sheet
metal
and
the
florida
heat
and
power
cases
preempted
the
state
court
from
taking
jurisdiction
in
any
labor
dispute
regardless
of
whether
or
not
it
was
a
contract
violation,
if
the
conduct
involved
was
either
arguably
protected
or
arguably
prohibited
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
district
court
rejected
this
argument,
affirmed
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court.
the
union
then
filed
--
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
with
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
which
was
granted
and
the
florida
supreme
court
reversed
the
district
court
in
a
five
to
two
decision,
relying
on
its
previous
holdings
in
the
scherer
and
sons
case
and
in
florida
heat
and
power.
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
florida
supreme
court
had
enunciated
this
court’s
doctrine
of
garmon.
we
filed
a
--
the
company
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
which
was
denied
and
we
are
here
today
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
was
filed
because
as
we
contend
in
our
brief
and
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
applies
in
the
face
of
smith
v.
evening
news
and
lincoln
mills
and
dowd
box.
we
submit
that
the
simple
question
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
a
state
court
is
preempted
from
enjoining
the
breach
of
a
no-strike
promise
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
simply
because
the
conduct
which
is
involved
in
the
breach
is
also
an
arguable
or
admitted
unfair
labor
practice.
in
this
case,
we
concede
that
the
conduct
of
the
union
in
striking
over
jurisdictional
dispute
was
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
of
the
act.
so
it
was
concededly
an
unfair
labor
practice.
we
submit
that
the
simple
question
can
be
answered
by
reviewing
this
court’s
holding
in
smith
v.
evening
news
and
carey
v.
westinghouse.
we
submit
that
if
the
state
court
has
jurisdiction
to
entertain
an
action
for
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
damages
or
to
compel
arbitration
as
was
the
case
in
carey
v.
westinghouse,
which
also
involved
a
jurisdictional
dispute
or
a
representation
question
depending
on
how
you
look
at
the
case,
then
all
the
more
so,
the
state
court
should
have
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
the
breach
of
a
no-strike
clause
because
this
promotes
the
free
flow
of
commerce,
which
is
so
basic
in
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
it
merely
reduces
an
industrial
strife
by
requiring
the
party
who
committed
the
breach
to
be
bound
by
the
promise
they
made
in
that
agreement
and
to
settle
this
dispute
in
a
peaceful
manner.
we
submit
that
the
only
distinction
that
can
be
had
between
the
smith
case
and
the
carey
case
and
the
case
before
you
is
that
this
case
involved
an
injunction
to
enjoin
the
further
breach
of
a
no-strike
promise.
and
we
submit
further
that
the
florida
supreme
court’s
reliance
on
the
garmon
doctrine
is
erroneous
in
that
there
is
a
major
distinguishing
factor
between
garmon
and
the
instant
case.
in
garmon,
we
were
not
concerned
with
a
contractual
relationship
between
the
parties
and
in
both
of
the
cases
relied
upon
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
the
scherer
and
sons
case,
and
the
florida
heat
and
power,
we
admit
that
the
result
was
right
but
the
reasoning
was
wrong
because
a
reason
that
any
activity
arguably
prohibited
or
protected
is
preempted
with
--
in
a
broad
spectrum
and
not
taking
into
account
the
fact
that
there
maybe
a
contractual
relationship
between
the
parties.
now,
in
neither
of
those
cases
scherer
and
sons
nor
in
florida
heat
and
power
was
there
a
contractual
relationship
between
the
parties.
it
did
not
involve
a
contract
breach.
it
involved
activity
which
should
have
gone
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
because
it
was
activity
prohibited
under
section
8
of
the
act.
we
submit
therefore
that
under
the
prevailing
labor
law,
the
state
courts
are
not
preempted
in
circumstances
such
as
the
instant
case
and
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
should
be
reversed.
we
turn
next
to
what
we
believe
is
the
larger
question
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
role
of
state
court
in
the
adjudication
of
disputes
over
breaches
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
the
uniformity
of
national
labor
policy
in
both
among
the
states
and
the
relief
that’s
available
for
breaches
of
no-strike
clauses
or
other
contractual
promises
as
between
the
state
and
the
federal
courts.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
court’s
opinion
in
this
case
can
lay
down
guidelines
for
the
state
courts
to
be
guided
in
their
jurisdiction
as
to
the
adjudication
of
breaches
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
that
this
will
go
a
long
way
in
achieving
uniformity
of
the
result
between
both
state
and
federal
forums.
mr.
john
paul
jones
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
what
we
would
submit
is
that
this
question
so
far
as
we
can
tell
is
one
for
the
first
time
for
this
court
to
decide
as
far
as
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
to
enjoin
the
breach
of
a
no-strike
promise
by
way
of
injunction.
and
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
footnote
in
dowd
box
that
question
was
not
before
the
court
whether
or
not
norris-la
guardia
applied
to
the
state
so
as
to
preclude
their
issuance
of
an
injunction.
i
believe
that
question
was
answered
in
mr.
justice
brennan’s
opinion
in
boys
markets
where
in
that
opinion,
you
adopted
the
reasoning
of
justice
traynor
in
the
mccarroll
case
that
in
that
regard,
norris-la
guardia,
although
congress
could
have
precluded
the
states
from
jurisdiction
to
issue
injunctions,
they
did
not
do
so,
that
norris-la
guardia
applies
only
to
the
federal
courts.
now,
we
submit
that
the
question
is
before
the
court
in
terms
that
we’re
here
to
decide
whether
or
not
a
state
court
has
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
the
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
in
that
context,
then
the
opinion
in
this
court
will
decide
for
the
first
time,
“do
state
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
a
no-strike
promise
by
injunction?”
and
we
submit
that
they
do,
that
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
-
this
court’s
prior
holdings,
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
objective
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
achieve
a
uniform
policy
and
to
promote
industrial
peace
rather
than
industrial
strife.
we
--
i
think
that
the
parties
here
agree,
both
the
respondent
and
the
amicus
the
national
chamber
that
there
should
be
a
uniform
policy
throughout
the
country.
mr.
john
paul
jones
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
would
submit
that
this
question
could
be
answered
in
a
holding
by
this
court
that
state
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
no-strike
breaches
by
injunction
and
that
the
equitable
relief
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
yes,
in
the
boys
market
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
brennan
i
believe
it
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
i’m
sorry?
mr.
john
paul
jones
under
lincoln
mills,
they
must,
yes
sir
and
we
submit
that
for
clarity
and
for
uniformity
of
national
labor
policy
that
that’s
what
this
decision
should
mean
that
state
courts
are
bound
by
federal
law.
the
law
is
unclear
at
this
point
because
the
question
was
left
open
in
boys
markets
opinion
as
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
are
well
aware.
but
we
would
submit
that
under
boys
markets,
it
answered
the
question
for
whether
or
not
federal
courts
could
issue
an
injunction
in
a
labor
dispute,
not
withstanding
norris-la
guardia
restrictions.
we
submit
though
that
boys
markets
has
left
open
certain
questions
and
placed
certain
restrictions
upon
the
parties
in
their
free
collective
bargaining
process.
we
submit
that
the
holding
in
this
case
should
be
that
a
modified
boys
markets'
holding
would
apply
to
both
state
and
federal
courts
in
their
entertaining
any
suit
to
enjoin
the
breach
of
a
no-strike
promise
and
that
we
submit
further
that
no-strike
promises
are
generally
enforceable
in
either
state
or
federal
courts.
we
would
turn
now
to
several
of
the
items
in
boys
markets,
which
we
consider
were
left
open
and
would
like
to
advance
argument
to
the
court
on.
in
boys
markets,
one
of
the
conditions
precedent,
which
mr.
justice
brennan
outlined
in
that
opinion
which
was
the
adoption
of
course
of
the
dissenting
opinion
in
sinclair,
was
that
as
a
condition
precedent,
the
subject
matter
of
the
dispute
had
to
be
subject
to
a
final
binding
agreements
and
arbitration
clause.
we
submit
that
a
no-strike
promise
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
should
be
enforced
in
either
state
or
federal
court
notwithstanding
whether
the
underlying
grievance
is
subject
to
a
binding
grievance
and
arbitration
clause
or
not.
now,
to
do
otherwise,
we
submit,
dictates
the
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
which
goes
against
this
court’s
decisions
in
american
national
insurance
company
in
1952
and
then
the
hk
porter
case.
the
reason
we
say
that
is
this.
when
the
parties
sit
down
at
the
bargaining
table
and
negotiate,
there
are
a
lot
of
factors
that
play
at
that
table
when
they
meet
and
discuss
the
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
employer
may
well
be
willing
to
pay
more
in
terms
of
wages
and
fringes
to
the
members
of
the
bargaining
union.
if
he
gets
in
return
therefore
a
specific
exclusion
from
the
arbitration
clause
of
some
management
decision,
for
example
in
subcontracting,
the
matter
that
was
involved
in
steelworkers
trilogy
and
warrior
and
gulf.
now,
we
submit
that
the
party
should
be
left
free
to
negotiate
their
own
terms
of
the
agreement.
in
warrior
and
gulf,
mr.
justice
douglas
recognized
that
the
parties
could
have
specifically
excluded
from
arbitration
that
matter
of
whether
or
not
they
had
the
right
unqualifiedly
to
subcontract
the
work
and
that
it
would
not
be
subject
to
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure.
we
note
that
in
the
gateway
decision,
mr.
justice
powell
noted
that
the
parties
could,
if
they
chose,
negotiate
a
broad
grievance
and
arbitration
clause
and
yet
specifically
by
terms
in
the
agreement
negate
any
no-strike
promise.
we
submit
that
if
the
parties
can
do
that,
then
albeit
they
can
exclude
a
narrow
area
from
arbitration.
and
that
to
do
so,
and
to
still
have
the
no-strike
promise
enforceable
even
though
the
subject
matter
of
dispute
maybe
within
that
narrow
confine
that’s
not
subject
to
arbitration
promotes
the
policies
of
the
act
rather
than
to
do
them
violence
because
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
act
of
course
is
to
promote
industrial
peace
and
harmony
and
to
reduce
interruptions
of
work
through
strikes
and
work
stoppages.
the
whole
underlying
purpose
of
the
taft-hartley
amendment
was
to
equalize
the
bargaining
positions
and
the
enforceability
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
as
between
employers
and
unions
because
at
that
point,
employers
had
little
incentive
to
enter
into
collective
bargaining
agreements,
if
they
could
not
have
them
enforced,
and
therefore,
came
the
section
301
jurisdiction
which
it
seems
clear
takes
into
its
sphere
not
only
legal
relief,
but
equitable
relief.
the
legislative
history
of
that
seems
somewhat
clear.
we
submit
that
the
rule
as
to
enforcement
of
no-strike
promises
should
follow
along
the
lines
of
a
doctrine
enunciated
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
warrior
and
gulf.
and
in
that
case,
the
arguably
arbitrable
doctrine
was
established
that
anything
that
was
arguably
arbitrable
would
be
deemed
to
be
subject
to
the
arbitration
clause
of
the
contract.
we
submit
that
no-strike
promises
should
be
arguably
enjoinable
and
that
if
the
union
promises
for
the
duration
of
the
contract
not
to
strike
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
paul
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
paul
jones
yes,
mr.
brennan.
mr.
john
paul
jones
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
paul
jones
that’s
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
paul
jones
i’m
asking
this
court
to
look
at
that
question
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
the
boys
markets
decision
has
left
open
whether
or
not
it
applies
to
state
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
to
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
that’s
correct,
but
in
boys
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
yes,
sir
but
in
adopting
the
boys
markets
decision
of
course,
it
was
the
dissenting
opinion
from
sinclair
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
--
which
setup
these
--
these
conditions
precedent
to
invoking
the
arbitration,
to
invoking
the
court's
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
the
breach
of
a
no-strike
promise.
mr.
john
paul
jones
was
one
of
the
conditions.
mr.
john
paul
jones
in
the
sinclair
dissent,
that
was
listed
and
adopted
i
think
just
verbatim
as
this
court's
holding
in
boys
markets
was
that
one
that
had
to
be
--
the
dispute
had
to
be
subject
to
the
grievance
and
arbitration.
mr.
john
paul
jones
yes
sir
and
also
that
in
the
court’s
order,
it
should
order
the
employer
to
arbitrate
that.
now,
we
would
submit
that
the
order
should
run
both
ways.
it
should
order
both
parties
and
i
believe
that
in
the
boys
markets
case
that
that
was
the
case.
the
district
court
did
order
both
parties
to
submit
to
arbitration.
we're
simply
mr.
justice
brennan
pointing
out
that
in
the
boys
markets’
decision,
the
loopholes
that
were
left
there
we're
pointing
on
here
will
provide
an
opportunity
unless
state
courts
are
granted
through
this
decision
broad
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
those
strike
promises,
that
were
going
to
be
faced
with
the
situation
where
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
yes,
sir
and
that
mr.
justice
brennan
is
our
point
in
that
if
that
is
declared
holding
in
boys
markets
then
through
that
decision,
we
are
dictating
the
substance
of
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
because
if
an
employer
knows
that
in
order
to
have
a
no-strike
promise
enforced,
he
has
to
have
everything
subject
to
the
grievance
and
arbitration
clause
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
--
then
we’re
telling
the
employer
you
must
agree
if
you
want
your
no-strike
promise
which
you
paid
dearly
to
get
to
have
peace
for
a
year
or
two
years
or
three
years,
you
must
agree
to
a
broad
grievance
arbitration
clause
that
covers
everything.
then
we
are
dictating
to
that
employer
the
terms
of
--
a
substantive
of
term
of
that
collective
bargaining
agreement.
we
submit
that
if
that
is
the
holding,
then
we
are
placing
restrictions
on
the
employer
that
are
not
contemplated
nor
desired
by
the
act
which
promotes
and
encourages
free
collective
bargaining
between
the
parties
and
leaves
the
parties
at
the
door
of
the
bargaining
realm.
and
that
depends
then
on
the
relative
strength
of
the
parties
and
the
skill
of
the
negotiators
and
how
much
each
party
is
willing
to
pay
to
get
an
agreement.
we
submit
that
there
are
several
areas
that
are
left
open
in
boys
markets,
several
loopholes.
for
instance,
if
the
union
wants
to
say
we’re
going
to
strike
but
we
don’t
--
we’re
not
going
to
tell
you
what
we’re
striking
about
if
they're
dissatisfied
with
their
union
representation,
collyer
can
strike.
under
boys
markets
that
would
not
be
subject
to
the
grievance
arbitration
clause.
we
submit
that
the
instant
case
presents
a
perfect
opportunity
of
demonstrating
what
will
happen
unless
there's
uniformity
of
decision
among
the
states
and
that
the
thrust
of
the
florida
supreme
court’s
decision
is
that
the
employer
can
sit
and
negotiate
the
terms
of
a
bargaining
agreement,
extract
a
promise
from
the
union
through
give
and
take
process.
and
yet
if
that
process
is
not
enforceable
in
a
state
court,
then
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
the
employer
has
been
undermined
in
his
bargaining
attempt.
and
we
would
point
out
too
that
unless
the
--
unless
the
rule
is
the
same
as
to
state
and
federal
courts
that
one,
if
state
courts
have
broader
jurisdiction
to
grant
greater
relief
from
the
federal
courts,
we’ll
get
into
a
situation
of
pre
boys
markets
where
its
removed
under
the
f
code
because
if
they
can
narrow
their
relief,
they’re
removed
from
the
federal
court.
and
if
this
is
the
case
or
if
the
state
courts
do
not
have
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
breaches
of
no-strike
promises,
then
we
are
going
to
add
greatly
to
the
workload
of
the
federal
court
system.
and
in
that
regard,
i
would
point
out
that
in
our
jurisdiction
in
jacksonville,
we
have
20
general
jurisdiction
state
courts
that
are
available
to
apply
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
we
have
two
already
over
docketed
federal
district
judges.
and
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don’t
believe
that
the
case
turns
on
that.
we
would
submit
that
there
is
a
binding
arbitration
clause
when
the
whole
contract
is
read
which
is
in
the
appendix,
beginning
at
page
820.
we
submit
that
the
parties
have
agreed
to
abide
by
the
terms
for
settlement
of
jurisdictional
disputes
under
the
joint
board
and
that
that
incorporates
by
reference
that
document
which
would
set
up
the
final
binding
provisions
of
the
agreement.
mr.
john
paul
jones
if
there
is
no
final
and
binding
arbitration?
we
would
submit
that
the
state
court
still
has
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
the
no-strike
promise
because
the
union
agreed
there
shall
be
no
work
stoppages
because
of
jurisdictional
disputes.
now,
in
this
context
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
they
decided
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place
ab
initio
because
of
the
garmon
doctrine,
which
is
what
they
incorporated
in
their
two
decisions
on
which
they
relied.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
erroneous
reasoning
and
erroneous
result
that
the
state
court
is
not
preempted,
that
the
state
court
has
jurisdiction,
that
the
case
is
the
smith
case
except
in
this
case
there
was
an
injunction
issue.
and
this
is
where
we
submit
is
a
broader
question
in
this
case
which
should
be
examined
along
with
boys
markets
that
there
ought
to
be
uniformity
both
among
the
states
and
between
state
and
federal
courts.
mr.
john
paul
jones
well,
that’s
correct
and
i
think
that
the
district
court
of
appeal
made
some
mention
about
the
application
of
boys
market
and
the
state
of
whether
or
not
it’s
free
of
error
because
he
did
not
issue
also
an
order
for
the
employer
to
arbitrate.
mr.
john
paul
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
just
one
or
two
closing
points.
my
adversary
has
pointed
out
that
in
regard
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
they
could
well
take
cognizance
of
the
matter
and
grant
relief.
we
would
point
out;
one,
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
issue
cease
and
desist
orders.
they
must
be
enforced
through
a
circuit
court
if
it’s
an
order
of
the
board
or
also
under
section
10
(k),
they
are
required
by
statute
to
defer
to
a
voluntary
method
if
it’s
outlined
in
the
agreement.
we
would
point
out
as
mr.
justice
douglas
pointed
out
in
lockridge
dissent
that
the
machinery
of
the
board
is
one
of
the
slowest
grinding
processes
that
one
could
experience
and
someone
would
be
out
of
business
by
the
time
they
invoke
those
procedures.
the
nlrb
has
held
in
the
vmc
brooklyn
case,
the
collyer
case,
and
the
laborers
case
that
they
will
defer
to
an
arbitration
process
even
when
there
may
be
a
specific
violation
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
we
would
point
out
also
that
in
carey,
there
were
two
unions
involved
and
that
it
wasn’t
clear
of
whether
both
of
them
were
subject
to
the
arbitration
clause,
but
arbitration
was
ordered
by
the
holding
in
this
court.
we
submit
that
the
question
as
to
norris-la
guardia
and
the
application
of
the
states
was
answered
in
the
boys
markets
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
adopted
justice
traynor’s
reasoning
in
the
mccarroll
case.
we
would
submit
that
by
virtue
of
that,
that
question
has
been
answered.
the
states
courts
do
then
have
jurisdiction
to
issue
injunctions
in
labor
disputes
in
contractual
matters
when
you
apply
the
reasoning
of
smith
v.
evening
news.
and
we
would
submit
that
the
best
effectuation
of
national
labor
policy,
of
freedom
of
collective
bargaining,
of
the
free
flow
of
commerce
and
of
deferral
to
the
parties
choice
of
the
terms
of
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
all
of
these
things
are
best
served
by
permitting
the
states
to
enjoin
breaches
of
no-strike
promises.
and
that
this
will
go
a
long
way
toward
achieving
uniformity
among
the
states
and
between
the
state
and
federal
systems.
that
in
--
as
was
pointed
out
in
boys
market,
damage
action
may
lie
for
the
breach
of
a
no-strike
promise,
but
a
damage
action
is
hardly
compensation
for
the
irreparable
harm
that
occurs
to
an
employer
when
a
strike
occurs
and
that
the
injunction
is
so
important
device
in
the
enforcement
of
no-strike
promises,
that
it
should
not
be
denied
that
in
the
maxim
of
“justice
delayed
is
justice
denied”
has
no
truer
meaning
than
in
this
context.
when
a
strike
occurs,
irreparable
damages
begin
to
run
and
the
employer
is
left
with
no
forum.
he
cannot
go
to
the
state
court.
if
he
goes
to
the
federal
court,
it’s
a
longer
way
or
if
he
is
required
to
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
which
really
can’t
grant
him
no
immediate
relief
anyway,
then
he
is
left
without
any
remedy
at
all.
and
even
under
the
injunction
procedures
of
the
national
labor
relations
board
in
8
(b)
(4)
(b)
or
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
situations,
where
under
the
statute,
the
board
is
required
to
give
them
priority
treatment.
our
practical
experience
has
been
that
if
you
can
get
to
the
u.s.
district
court
within
ten
days,
it’s
a
miracle.
and
from
that
regard
then
we
submit
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
no
forum
to
adjudicate
this.
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
do
so
and
they
do
not
have
machinery
and
they’ve
said
themselves
that
they
will
defer
to
the
parties.
we
submit
therefore
that
the
basic
question
here
that
we
face
in
determining
the
matter
of
whether
or
not
state
court
should
be
allowed
to
enjoin
no-strike
promises
is
how
can
the
purposes
of
the
act
be
frustrated
or
the
employees
rights
be
infringed
if
they
are
required
to
do
what
they
promised
to
do
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement?
mr.
john
paul
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
case
before
you
is
a
case
involving
a
state
court's
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
the
violation
of
a
no-strike
promise
by
a
union.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
a
general
contractor
and
for
purposes
of
clarity
and
keeping
the
party
straight,
i'll
refer
it
to
the
william
e.
arnold
company
petitioner
in
this
case
as
company.
the
company
and
the
union
had
an
agreement,
which
provided
that
there
would
be
no
strikes
over
a
jurisdictional
dispute.
the
general
contractor,
the
company’s
subcontractor
who
had
a
contract
with
another
union
pursuant
to
that
agreement
assigned
certain
work
to
this
other
union.
the
respondents
here,
the
union,
then
struck
in
violation
of
the
no-strike
clause,
which
also
provided
that
the
grievance
arbitration
procedure
of
the
national
joint
board
would
obtain
in
any
disputes
over
jurisdictional
dispute.
the
company
then
filed
an
action
in
the
state
court
for
a
temporary
restraining
order,
which
was
granted
after
a
notice
to
the
union’s
attorney
and
after
the
preemption
doctrines
had
been
argued
before
the
state
judge.
a
temporary
restraining
order
was
issued
enjoining
the
union
from
further
breach
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
union
then
filed
a
suggestion
for
writ
of
prohibition
in
the
first
district
court
of
appeal
and
state
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
pardon
sir?
mr.
john
paul
jones
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan
it
was.
it
was
not
denominated
as
such
in
the
pleadings,
but
it
was
in
301.
the
suggestion
for
writ
of
prohibition
was
filed
in
the
first
district
on
the
basis
that
the
garmon
doctrine
as
it
had
been
enunciated
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
both
the
sheet
metal
and
the
florida
heat
and
power
cases
preempted
the
state
court
from
taking
jurisdiction
in
any
labor
dispute
regardless
of
whether
or
not
it
was
a
contract
violation,
if
the
conduct
involved
was
either
arguably
protected
or
arguably
prohibited
under
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
district
court
rejected
this
argument,
affirmed
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court.
the
union
then
filed
--
filed
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
with
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
which
was
granted
and
the
florida
supreme
court
reversed
the
district
court
in
a
five
to
two
decision,
relying
on
its
previous
holdings
in
the
scherer
and
sons
case
and
in
florida
heat
and
power.
in
both
of
those
cases,
the
florida
supreme
court
had
enunciated
this
court’s
doctrine
of
garmon.
we
filed
a
--
the
company
filed
a
petition
for
rehearing
which
was
denied
and
we
are
here
today
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
florida
supreme
court.
our
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
was
filed
because
as
we
contend
in
our
brief
and
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
applies
in
the
face
of
smith
v.
evening
news
and
lincoln
mills
and
dowd
box.
we
submit
that
the
simple
question
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
a
state
court
is
preempted
from
enjoining
the
breach
of
a
no-strike
promise
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
simply
because
the
conduct
which
is
involved
in
the
breach
is
also
an
arguable
or
admitted
unfair
labor
practice.
in
this
case,
we
concede
that
the
conduct
of
the
union
in
striking
over
jurisdictional
dispute
was
a
violation
of
section
8
(b)
(4)
(d)
of
the
act.
so
it
was
concededly
an
unfair
labor
practice.
we
submit
that
the
simple
question
can
be
answered
by
reviewing
this
court’s
holding
in
smith
v.
evening
news
and
carey
v.
westinghouse.
we
submit
that
if
the
state
court
has
jurisdiction
to
entertain
an
action
for
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
for
damages
or
to
compel
arbitration
as
was
the
case
in
carey
v.
westinghouse,
which
also
involved
a
jurisdictional
dispute
or
a
representation
question
depending
on
how
you
look
at
the
case,
then
all
the
more
so,
the
state
court
should
have
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
the
breach
of
a
no-strike
clause
because
this
promotes
the
free
flow
of
commerce,
which
is
so
basic
in
the
purposes
of
the
act
and
it
merely
reduces
an
industrial
strife
by
requiring
the
party
who
committed
the
breach
to
be
bound
by
the
promise
they
made
in
that
agreement
and
to
settle
this
dispute
in
a
peaceful
manner.
we
submit
that
the
only
distinction
that
can
be
had
between
the
smith
case
and
the
carey
case
and
the
case
before
you
is
that
this
case
involved
an
injunction
to
enjoin
the
further
breach
of
a
no-strike
promise.
and
we
submit
further
that
the
florida
supreme
court’s
reliance
on
the
garmon
doctrine
is
erroneous
in
that
there
is
a
major
distinguishing
factor
between
garmon
and
the
instant
case.
in
garmon,
we
were
not
concerned
with
a
contractual
relationship
between
the
parties
and
in
both
of
the
cases
relied
upon
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
the
scherer
and
sons
case,
and
the
florida
heat
and
power,
we
admit
that
the
result
was
right
but
the
reasoning
was
wrong
because
a
reason
that
any
activity
arguably
prohibited
or
protected
is
preempted
with
--
in
a
broad
spectrum
and
not
taking
into
account
the
fact
that
there
maybe
a
contractual
relationship
between
the
parties.
now,
in
neither
of
those
cases
scherer
and
sons
nor
in
florida
heat
and
power
was
there
a
contractual
relationship
between
the
parties.
it
did
not
involve
a
contract
breach.
it
involved
activity
which
should
have
gone
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
because
it
was
activity
prohibited
under
section
8
of
the
act.
we
submit
therefore
that
under
the
prevailing
labor
law,
the
state
courts
are
not
preempted
in
circumstances
such
as
the
instant
case
and
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
should
be
reversed.
we
turn
next
to
what
we
believe
is
the
larger
question
in
this
case
and
that
is
the
role
of
state
court
in
the
adjudication
of
disputes
over
breaches
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
the
uniformity
of
national
labor
policy
in
both
among
the
states
and
the
relief
that’s
available
for
breaches
of
no-strike
clauses
or
other
contractual
promises
as
between
the
state
and
the
federal
courts.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
court’s
opinion
in
this
case
can
lay
down
guidelines
for
the
state
courts
to
be
guided
in
their
jurisdiction
as
to
the
adjudication
of
breaches
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
that
this
will
go
a
long
way
in
achieving
uniformity
of
the
result
between
both
state
and
federal
forums.
mr.
john
paul
jones
well,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
what
we
would
submit
is
that
this
question
so
far
as
we
can
tell
is
one
for
the
first
time
for
this
court
to
decide
as
far
as
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
to
enjoin
the
breach
of
a
no-strike
promise
by
way
of
injunction.
and
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
footnote
in
dowd
box
that
question
was
not
before
the
court
whether
or
not
norris-la
guardia
applied
to
the
state
so
as
to
preclude
their
issuance
of
an
injunction.
i
believe
that
question
was
answered
in
mr.
justice
brennan’s
opinion
in
boys
markets
where
in
that
opinion,
you
adopted
the
reasoning
of
justice
traynor
in
the
mccarroll
case
that
in
that
regard,
norris-la
guardia,
although
congress
could
have
precluded
the
states
from
jurisdiction
to
issue
injunctions,
they
did
not
do
so,
that
norris-la
guardia
applies
only
to
the
federal
courts.
now,
we
submit
that
the
question
is
before
the
court
in
terms
that
we’re
here
to
decide
whether
or
not
a
state
court
has
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
the
breach
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
in
that
context,
then
the
opinion
in
this
court
will
decide
for
the
first
time,
“do
state
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
a
no-strike
promise
by
injunction?”
and
we
submit
that
they
do,
that
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
-
this
court’s
prior
holdings,
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
objective
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
achieve
a
uniform
policy
and
to
promote
industrial
peace
rather
than
industrial
strife.
we
--
i
think
that
the
parties
here
agree,
both
the
respondent
and
the
amicus
the
national
chamber
that
there
should
be
a
uniform
policy
throughout
the
country.
mr.
john
paul
jones
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
i
would
submit
that
this
question
could
be
answered
in
a
holding
by
this
court
that
state
courts
have
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
no-strike
breaches
by
injunction
and
that
the
equitable
relief
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
yes,
in
the
boys
market
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
brennan
i
believe
it
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
i’m
sorry?
mr.
john
paul
jones
under
lincoln
mills,
they
must,
yes
sir
and
we
submit
that
for
clarity
and
for
uniformity
of
national
labor
policy
that
that’s
what
this
decision
should
mean
that
state
courts
are
bound
by
federal
law.
the
law
is
unclear
at
this
point
because
the
question
was
left
open
in
boys
markets
opinion
as
mr.
justice
brennan,
you
are
well
aware.
but
we
would
submit
that
under
boys
markets,
it
answered
the
question
for
whether
or
not
federal
courts
could
issue
an
injunction
in
a
labor
dispute,
not
withstanding
norris-la
guardia
restrictions.
we
submit
though
that
boys
markets
has
left
open
certain
questions
and
placed
certain
restrictions
upon
the
parties
in
their
free
collective
bargaining
process.
we
submit
that
the
holding
in
this
case
should
be
that
a
modified
boys
markets'
holding
would
apply
to
both
state
and
federal
courts
in
their
entertaining
any
suit
to
enjoin
the
breach
of
a
no-strike
promise
and
that
we
submit
further
that
no-strike
promises
are
generally
enforceable
in
either
state
or
federal
courts.
we
would
turn
now
to
several
of
the
items
in
boys
markets,
which
we
consider
were
left
open
and
would
like
to
advance
argument
to
the
court
on.
in
boys
markets,
one
of
the
conditions
precedent,
which
mr.
justice
brennan
outlined
in
that
opinion
which
was
the
adoption
of
course
of
the
dissenting
opinion
in
sinclair,
was
that
as
a
condition
precedent,
the
subject
matter
of
the
dispute
had
to
be
subject
to
a
final
binding
agreements
and
arbitration
clause.
we
submit
that
a
no-strike
promise
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
should
be
enforced
in
either
state
or
federal
court
notwithstanding
whether
the
underlying
grievance
is
subject
to
a
binding
grievance
and
arbitration
clause
or
not.
now,
to
do
otherwise,
we
submit,
dictates
the
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
which
goes
against
this
court’s
decisions
in
american
national
insurance
company
in
1952
and
then
the
hk
porter
case.
the
reason
we
say
that
is
this.
when
the
parties
sit
down
at
the
bargaining
table
and
negotiate,
there
are
a
lot
of
factors
that
play
at
that
table
when
they
meet
and
discuss
the
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
employer
may
well
be
willing
to
pay
more
in
terms
of
wages
and
fringes
to
the
members
of
the
bargaining
union.
if
he
gets
in
return
therefore
a
specific
exclusion
from
the
arbitration
clause
of
some
management
decision,
for
example
in
subcontracting,
the
matter
that
was
involved
in
steelworkers
trilogy
and
warrior
and
gulf.
now,
we
submit
that
the
party
should
be
left
free
to
negotiate
their
own
terms
of
the
agreement.
in
warrior
and
gulf,
mr.
justice
douglas
recognized
that
the
parties
could
have
specifically
excluded
from
arbitration
that
matter
of
whether
or
not
they
had
the
right
unqualifiedly
to
subcontract
the
work
and
that
it
would
not
be
subject
to
the
grievance
and
arbitration
procedure.
we
note
that
in
the
gateway
decision,
mr.
justice
powell
noted
that
the
parties
could,
if
they
chose,
negotiate
a
broad
grievance
and
arbitration
clause
and
yet
specifically
by
terms
in
the
agreement
negate
any
no-strike
promise.
we
submit
that
if
the
parties
can
do
that,
then
albeit
they
can
exclude
a
narrow
area
from
arbitration.
and
that
to
do
so,
and
to
still
have
the
no-strike
promise
enforceable
even
though
the
subject
matter
of
dispute
maybe
within
that
narrow
confine
that’s
not
subject
to
arbitration
promotes
the
policies
of
the
act
rather
than
to
do
them
violence
because
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
act
of
course
is
to
promote
industrial
peace
and
harmony
and
to
reduce
interruptions
of
work
through
strikes
and
work
stoppages.
the
whole
underlying
purpose
of
the
taft-hartley
amendment
was
to
equalize
the
bargaining
positions
and
the
enforceability
of
collective
bargaining
agreements
as
between
employers
and
unions
because
at
that
point,
employers
had
little
incentive
to
enter
into
collective
bargaining
agreements,
if
they
could
not
have
them
enforced,
and
therefore,
came
the
section
301
jurisdiction
which
it
seems
clear
takes
into
its
sphere
not
only
legal
relief,
but
equitable
relief.
the
legislative
history
of
that
seems
somewhat
clear.
we
submit
that
the
rule
as
to
enforcement
of
no-strike
promises
should
follow
along
the
lines
of
a
doctrine
enunciated
by
mr.
justice
douglas
in
warrior
and
gulf.
and
in
that
case,
the
arguably
arbitrable
doctrine
was
established
that
anything
that
was
arguably
arbitrable
would
be
deemed
to
be
subject
to
the
arbitration
clause
of
the
contract.
we
submit
that
no-strike
promises
should
be
arguably
enjoinable
and
that
if
the
union
promises
for
the
duration
of
the
contract
not
to
strike
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
paul
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
paul
jones
yes,
mr.
brennan.
mr.
john
paul
jones
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
paul
jones
that’s
correct,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
john
paul
jones
i’m
asking
this
court
to
look
at
that
question
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
the
boys
markets
decision
has
left
open
whether
or
not
it
applies
to
state
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
to
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
that’s
correct,
but
in
boys
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
yes,
sir
but
in
adopting
the
boys
markets
decision
of
course,
it
was
the
dissenting
opinion
from
sinclair
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
--
which
setup
these
--
these
conditions
precedent
to
invoking
the
arbitration,
to
invoking
the
court's
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
the
breach
of
a
no-strike
promise.
mr.
john
paul
jones
was
one
of
the
conditions.
mr.
john
paul
jones
in
the
sinclair
dissent,
that
was
listed
and
adopted
i
think
just
verbatim
as
this
court's
holding
in
boys
markets
was
that
one
that
had
to
be
--
the
dispute
had
to
be
subject
to
the
grievance
and
arbitration.
mr.
john
paul
jones
yes
sir
and
also
that
in
the
court’s
order,
it
should
order
the
employer
to
arbitrate
that.
now,
we
would
submit
that
the
order
should
run
both
ways.
it
should
order
both
parties
and
i
believe
that
in
the
boys
markets
case
that
that
was
the
case.
the
district
court
did
order
both
parties
to
submit
to
arbitration.
we're
simply
mr.
justice
brennan
pointing
out
that
in
the
boys
markets’
decision,
the
loopholes
that
were
left
there
we're
pointing
on
here
will
provide
an
opportunity
unless
state
courts
are
granted
through
this
decision
broad
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
those
strike
promises,
that
were
going
to
be
faced
with
the
situation
where
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
yes,
sir
and
that
mr.
justice
brennan
is
our
point
in
that
if
that
is
declared
holding
in
boys
markets
then
through
that
decision,
we
are
dictating
the
substance
of
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
because
if
an
employer
knows
that
in
order
to
have
a
no-strike
promise
enforced,
he
has
to
have
everything
subject
to
the
grievance
and
arbitration
clause
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
--
then
we’re
telling
the
employer
you
must
agree
if
you
want
your
no-strike
promise
which
you
paid
dearly
to
get
to
have
peace
for
a
year
or
two
years
or
three
years,
you
must
agree
to
a
broad
grievance
arbitration
clause
that
covers
everything.
then
we
are
dictating
to
that
employer
the
terms
of
--
a
substantive
of
term
of
that
collective
bargaining
agreement.
we
submit
that
if
that
is
the
holding,
then
we
are
placing
restrictions
on
the
employer
that
are
not
contemplated
nor
desired
by
the
act
which
promotes
and
encourages
free
collective
bargaining
between
the
parties
and
leaves
the
parties
at
the
door
of
the
bargaining
realm.
and
that
depends
then
on
the
relative
strength
of
the
parties
and
the
skill
of
the
negotiators
and
how
much
each
party
is
willing
to
pay
to
get
an
agreement.
we
submit
that
there
are
several
areas
that
are
left
open
in
boys
markets,
several
loopholes.
for
instance,
if
the
union
wants
to
say
we’re
going
to
strike
but
we
don’t
--
we’re
not
going
to
tell
you
what
we’re
striking
about
if
they're
dissatisfied
with
their
union
representation,
collyer
can
strike.
under
boys
markets
that
would
not
be
subject
to
the
grievance
arbitration
clause.
we
submit
that
the
instant
case
presents
a
perfect
opportunity
of
demonstrating
what
will
happen
unless
there's
uniformity
of
decision
among
the
states
and
that
the
thrust
of
the
florida
supreme
court’s
decision
is
that
the
employer
can
sit
and
negotiate
the
terms
of
a
bargaining
agreement,
extract
a
promise
from
the
union
through
give
and
take
process.
and
yet
if
that
process
is
not
enforceable
in
a
state
court,
then
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
the
employer
has
been
undermined
in
his
bargaining
attempt.
and
we
would
point
out
too
that
unless
the
--
unless
the
rule
is
the
same
as
to
state
and
federal
courts
that
one,
if
state
courts
have
broader
jurisdiction
to
grant
greater
relief
from
the
federal
courts,
we’ll
get
into
a
situation
of
pre
boys
markets
where
its
removed
under
the
f
code
because
if
they
can
narrow
their
relief,
they’re
removed
from
the
federal
court.
and
if
this
is
the
case
or
if
the
state
courts
do
not
have
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
breaches
of
no-strike
promises,
then
we
are
going
to
add
greatly
to
the
workload
of
the
federal
court
system.
and
in
that
regard,
i
would
point
out
that
in
our
jurisdiction
in
jacksonville,
we
have
20
general
jurisdiction
state
courts
that
are
available
to
apply
for
a
temporary
restraining
order.
we
have
two
already
over
docketed
federal
district
judges.
and
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
don’t
believe
that
the
case
turns
on
that.
we
would
submit
that
there
is
a
binding
arbitration
clause
when
the
whole
contract
is
read
which
is
in
the
appendix,
beginning
at
page
820.
we
submit
that
the
parties
have
agreed
to
abide
by
the
terms
for
settlement
of
jurisdictional
disputes
under
the
joint
board
and
that
that
incorporates
by
reference
that
document
which
would
set
up
the
final
binding
provisions
of
the
agreement.
mr.
john
paul
jones
if
there
is
no
final
and
binding
arbitration?
we
would
submit
that
the
state
court
still
has
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
the
no-strike
promise
because
the
union
agreed
there
shall
be
no
work
stoppages
because
of
jurisdictional
disputes.
now,
in
this
context
--
mr.
john
paul
jones
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
they
decided
that
they
had
no
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place
ab
initio
because
of
the
garmon
doctrine,
which
is
what
they
incorporated
in
their
two
decisions
on
which
they
relied.
and
we
submit
that
that
is
erroneous
reasoning
and
erroneous
result
that
the
state
court
is
not
preempted,
that
the
state
court
has
jurisdiction,
that
the
case
is
the
smith
case
except
in
this
case
there
was
an
injunction
issue.
and
this
is
where
we
submit
is
a
broader
question
in
this
case
which
should
be
examined
along
with
boys
markets
that
there
ought
to
be
uniformity
both
among
the
states
and
between
state
and
federal
courts.
mr.
john
paul
jones
well,
that’s
correct
and
i
think
that
the
district
court
of
appeal
made
some
mention
about
the
application
of
boys
market
and
the
state
of
whether
or
not
it’s
free
of
error
because
he
did
not
issue
also
an
order
for
the
employer
to
arbitrate.
mr.
john
paul
jones
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
just
one
or
two
closing
points.
my
adversary
has
pointed
out
that
in
regard
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
that
they
could
well
take
cognizance
of
the
matter
and
grant
relief.
we
would
point
out;
one,
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
issue
cease
and
desist
orders.
they
must
be
enforced
through
a
circuit
court
if
it’s
an
order
of
the
board
or
also
under
section
10
(k),
they
are
required
by
statute
to
defer
to
a
voluntary
method
if
it’s
outlined
in
the
agreement.
we
would
point
out
as
mr.
justice
douglas
pointed
out
in
lockridge
dissent
that
the
machinery
of
the
board
is
one
of
the
slowest
grinding
processes
that
one
could
experience
and
someone
would
be
out
of
business
by
the
time
they
invoke
those
procedures.
the
nlrb
has
held
in
the
vmc
brooklyn
case,
the
collyer
case,
and
the
laborers
case
that
they
will
defer
to
an
arbitration
process
even
when
there
may
be
a
specific
violation
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
we
would
point
out
also
that
in
carey,
there
were
two
unions
involved
and
that
it
wasn’t
clear
of
whether
both
of
them
were
subject
to
the
arbitration
clause,
but
arbitration
was
ordered
by
the
holding
in
this
court.
we
submit
that
the
question
as
to
norris-la
guardia
and
the
application
of
the
states
was
answered
in
the
boys
markets
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan
adopted
justice
traynor’s
reasoning
in
the
mccarroll
case.
we
would
submit
that
by
virtue
of
that,
that
question
has
been
answered.
the
states
courts
do
then
have
jurisdiction
to
issue
injunctions
in
labor
disputes
in
contractual
matters
when
you
apply
the
reasoning
of
smith
v.
evening
news.
and
we
would
submit
that
the
best
effectuation
of
national
labor
policy,
of
freedom
of
collective
bargaining,
of
the
free
flow
of
commerce
and
of
deferral
to
the
parties
choice
of
the
terms
of
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
all
of
these
things
are
best
served
by
permitting
the
states
to
enjoin
breaches
of
no-strike
promises.
and
that
this
will
go
a
long
way
toward
achieving
uniformity
among
the
states
and
between
the
state
and
federal
systems.
that
in
--
as
was
pointed
out
in
boys
market,
damage
action
may
lie
for
the
breach
of
a
no-strike
promise,
but
a
damage
action
is
hardly
compensation
for
the
irreparable
harm
that
occurs
to
an
employer
when
a
strike
occurs
and
that
the
injunction
is
so
important
device
in
the
enforcement
of
no-strike
promises,
that
it
should
not
be
denied
that
in
the
maxim
of
“justice
delayed
is
justice
denied”
has
no
truer
meaning
than
in
this
context.
when
a
strike
occurs,
irreparable
damages
begin
to
run
and
the
employer
is
left
with
no
forum.
he
cannot
go
to
the
state
court.
if
he
goes
to
the
federal
court,
it’s
a
longer
way
or
if
he
is
required
to
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
which
really
can’t
grant
him
no
immediate
relief
anyway,
then
he
is
left
without
any
remedy
at
all.
and
even
under
the

of

situations,
where
under
the
statute,
the
board
is
required
to
give

priority
treatment.
our
practical
experience
has
been
that
if
you
can
get
to
the
u.s.
district
court
within
ten
days,
it’s
a
miracle.
and
from
that
regard
then
we
submit
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
is
no
forum
to
adjudicate
this.
they
do
not
have
the
power
to
do
so
and
they
do
not
have
machinery
and
they’ve
said
themselves
that
they
will
defer
to
the
parties.
we
submit
therefore
that
the
basic
question
here
that
we
face
in
determining
the
matter
of
whether
or
not
state
court
should
be
allowed
to
enjoin
no-strike
promises
is
how
can
the
purposes
of
the
act
be
frustrated
or
the
employees
rights
be
infringed
if
they
are
required
to
do
what
they
promised
to
do
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement?
