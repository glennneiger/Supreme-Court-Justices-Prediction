the
connecticut
national
bank
case
is
another
civil
antitrust
case
brought
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
here
the
government
challenged
the
validity
of
a
proposed
consolidation
between
the
fourth
and
the
eighth
largest
banks
in
connecticut.
there
was
no
significant
direct
competition
and
the
government's
challenge
is
based
solely
on
a
potential-competition
doctrine.
the
district
court
for
connecticut
concluded
that
there
was
no
violation
of
antitrust
laws.
the
government
appealed
the
case
directly
to
us
under
the
expediting
act.
as
we
think
the
district
court
erred
in
its
determination
of
the
appropriate
line
of
commerce
and
the
relevant
geographic
market,
we
vacate
and
remand
the
case
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
our
opinion
today
and
the
prior
precedents
of
this
court.
all
members
of
the
court
would
vacate
and
remand,
but
for
different
reasons.

douglas,

in

one
of

opinion

appropriate
line
of
commerce.

has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
this
respect,
but
otherwise
dissenting.
