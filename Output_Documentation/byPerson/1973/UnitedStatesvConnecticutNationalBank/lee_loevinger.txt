mr.
lee
loevinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
first
to
answer
a
question
which
i
believe
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
stewart
as
to
the
genesis
of
potential
competition.
my
research
indicates
it
has
been
considered
in
six
cases
of
which
the
first
the
el
paso
case.
the
six
cases
are
el
paso,
continental
can,
penn-olin
which
was
the
third
case,
proctor
and
gamble,
ford
and
falstaff.
falstaff
is
the
first
case
in
which
in
this
court
gave
rather
plenary
consideration
to
it.
the
cases
are
discussed,
beginning
at
page
76
of
our
brief
in
this
case.
the
six
cases
just
mentioned
are
summarized
at
pages
82
and
83.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
has
been
some
--
there’s
obviously
a
conflict
as
there
are
always
is
in
cases
coming
to
this
court,
but
there
is
a
matter
here
that
involves
an
apparent
conflict
of
philosophy
between
government
agencies.
clearly,
the
banking
agencies,
comptroller
of
the
currency,
and
the
department
of
justice
are
in
conflict
and
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
it
might
be
useful
if
i
could
without
really
tying
anybody
down
to
anything,
try
to
analyze
the
phases
of
this
conflicting
philosophy.
the
department
argues
in
this
case
that
if
large,
healthy
banks
like
connecticut
national
and
first
new
haven
are
permitted
to
expand
by
merger.
that
the
result
will
be
a
statewide
structure
in
which
most
local
markets
will
be
nominated
by
a
few
large
banks.
now,
i
suggest
that
this
is
a
much
more
likely
result
if
these
banks
are
not
permitted
to
expand
by
merger.
as
the
department
itself
admits,
there
is
in
the
nature
of
local
markets,
there
are
relatively
few
banks.
you
can’t
talk
about
local
banking
markets
and
banking
as
one
of
the
most
competitive
fields
in
the
united
states.
you
can’t
talk
about
local
banking
market
because
all
you
were
taking
about
the
national
beer
market
as
you
are
falstaff.
in
fact
a
remarkable
coincidence
is
that
in
falstaff
there
were
10
actual
or
potential
competitors
in
a
national
beer
market
where
as
in
a
tiny
little
state
like
connecticut,
the
third
smallest
state
in
united
states,
they
are
still
talking
about
10
competitors.
well,
when
you
get
it
down
to
little
local
markets,
you
don’t
get
large
numbers
and
if
you
confine
these
banks
by
forbidding
mergers
which
you
aren’t
going
to
get
are
dominant
local
banks.
there
is
simply
no
question
about
this
in
my
mind.
let
me
try
to
illustrate
it
by
posing
two
alternative
concepts.
these
are
admittedly
highly
hypothetical.
they
correspond
only
roughly
to
reality
because
you
can't
construct
a
hypothetical
that
really
corresponds
to
all
of
the
aspects
of
reality.
but
let
us
a
take
a
state
that
has
50
towns
in
it.
each
one
of
which
has
two
banks,
so
that
there
is
competition
among
each
of
these
two
banks.
there
are
no
large
dominant
banks,
no
large
dominant
cities.
every
bank
has
approximately
1%
of
the
banking
business
in
the
state.
according
to
the
department’s
theory,
the
state
is
competitive
because
nobody
has
more
than
1%
but
every
single
banking
market
in
the
state,
each
town
is
concentrated
because
there
are
only
two
banks,
and
two
banks
have
a
100%.
now,
let
us
take
an
alternative
thing.
let
us
say
that
by
some
miracle
of
legal
transmutation,
administrative
and
legal
action
that
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
mergers
in
this
state
and
that
the
50
or
rather
the
100
banks
in
the
state
merge
into
10
statewide
banks,
10
much
larger
statewide
banks
and
that
as
a
result
of
this,
they
decide
to
branch
out,
and
so
each
of
them
establishes
branches
in
a
number
not
in
all,
but
in
a
number
of
states,
so
we
end
up
with
let
us
say
hypothetically
each
town
has
five
banks.
there
are
250
banking
offices
in
the
state,
as
opposed
to
a
100
banking
offices
previously.
now,
the
department
tells
us
that
the
difference
in
banking
offices
don’t
make
any
difference,
but
each
town
now
has
five
baking
offices,
each
representing
a
different
bank.
the
state
on
the
other
hand
has
only
10
banks.
the
same
number
as
competitors
that
were
nationally
in
falstaff.
on
the
state
basis,
they
would
say
that
there
is
concentration
because
10
banks
have
a
100%.
indeed
there
is
likely
to
be
some
asymmetry
and
it
is
likely
that
five
banks
have
a
little
bit
more
than
50%,
so
they
tell
the
state
bank
that
this
is
concentrated.
on
a
local
basis,
there
is
less
concentration
certainly
because
each
locality
has
five
banks,
although
five
banks
still
have
a
100%
which
according
to
the
definitions
and
test
we
have
been
given
is
still
concentration
and
yet
i
submit
to
the
court
“which
way
is
the
public
being
better
served?
having
five
alternatives,
five
competitors
available
in
every
town
to
every
bank
customer
or
having
two
little
banks?”
now,
i
submit
that
this
is
the
basic
conflict
in
philosophy
between
the
department
of
justice
and
the
comptroller
here.
that
the
department
says
that
a
larger
number
of
smaller
limited
service,
limited
competition
banks
is
preferable
whereas
the
comptroller
without
making
any
arbitrary
commitments
as
to
number
says
that
a
generally
smaller
number
of
larger
full
service,
fully
competitive
banks
will
better
serve
the
public
interest.
now,
reality
is
always
far
more
complex
than
these
hypothesis,
but
i
think
that
what
this
does
illustrate
is
that
simple
per
se
rules
just
don’t
work
and
very
often
will
in
fact
work
to
frustrate
the
very
objective
that
they
are
thought
to
be
serving.
indeed,
in
some
respects
you
can
see
this
in
connecticut
here.
we
have
been
given
a
test
by
mr.
shapiro
that
the
market
is
concentrated
if
the
top
ten
have
80%
or
more
or
if
the
top
five
have
40%
or
more
of
the
market
and
he
applies
this
and
says
“we’ve
got
a
concentrated
market
in
connecticut.”
well,
let’s
look
at
the
facts.
the
connecticut
national
and
the
first
new
haven,
the
merging
banks
here,
their
share
of
commercial
bank
deposits
and
i
refer
only
to
those
because
i
don’t
think
the
line
of
commerce
makes
any
difference
here,
that
their
share
of
commercial
bank
deposits
from
1959
to
1972
declined
from
13.8%
to
10.3%.
they
have
a
declining
share
of
total
state
commercial
bank
deposits.
the
hartford
national
and
connecticut
bank
and
trust,
the
two
giant
hartford
banks
have
34.5%
in
1959,
but
41.3%
in
1972.
consequently,
if
you
are
looking
for
the
40%
test
of
the
top
five,
you
can
add
any
other
three
to
the
hartford
bank
and
cbg
and
you
get
over
40%.
now,
i
submit
again
that
this
simply
beggar's
common
sense
that
you
cannot
say
because
the
two
leaders
are
increasing
their
percentage
that
their
competitors
should
be
precluded
for
merging.
if
there
is
any
sense
at
all
to
this
notion
of
structure
as
a
test
of
competitive
performance,
it
must
be
that
increasing
concentration
forecloses
merger
to
those
who
are
in
the
increasingly
concentrated
segment
to
the
growing
segment
of
the
market
not
to
those
who
are
in
the
diminishing
segment.
simply
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
because
our
two
big
competitors
are
increasing
their
share,
that
therefore,
we
will
foreclose
the
opportunity
to
merge
to
the
two
smaller
banks
and
indeed
this
is
the
very
hypothesis
that
was
rejected
in
brown
shoe
in
the
quotation
that
i
read
earlier
and
that
is
cited
in
our
brief.
justice
white
asked,
“what
is
the
difference
between
the
first
and
the
second
in
rank
and
perhaps
those
lower
in
rank
among
potential
entrants,
either
from
the
viewpoint
of
a
perceived
or
an
actual
future
potential
entrant?”
i
think
i
might
answer
that
slightly
differently
than
mr.
reycraft.
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
i
think
we
all
generally
agree
or
at
least
we
assume
as
a
matter
of
antitrust
law
that
if
you
have
more
competitors,
you
have
more
competition.
if
have
only
got
one
or
two
competitors,
you
are
less
likely
to
have
strong
competition
in
a
market
than
if
you
have
10
or
15
in
most
markets
in
most
circumstances
at
least.
however,
what
is
true
of
the
actual
competitors
is
not
necessarily
true
of
potential
competitors.
potential
competitor
exerts
whatever
influence
he
exerts
by
virtue
of
the
perception
of
those
in
the
market.
the
perception
of
those
or
in
the
case
of
the
actual
potential
competitor
as
a
future
possibility,
but
the
perception
of
those
in
the
market
is
obviously
fastened
on
the
number
possible
entrant
and
whether
there
are
15
or
20
or
30
lined
up
behind
them
which
seem
to
make
a
very
little
difference.
indeed,
if
you
will
look
at
the
economic
literature
on
the
subject,
it
does
indeed
say
and
there
is
even
some
recognition
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
significant
potential
entrant
is
the
most
likely
potential
entrant
and
maybe
this
holds
true
of
the
first
or
second,
i
don’t
know
how
far
down
the
line
you
go,
but
after
you
pass
one
or
two
potential
entrants,
those
in
line
behind
really
lose
all
significance.
mr.
lee
loevinger
well,
it
is
--
the
cases
referred
to
the
most
likely
entrant
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
lee
loevinger
this
may
be
the
discussion
in
those
cases.
i
do
not
recollect
with
that
degree
of
sharpness,
but
the
distinction
between
the
actual
or
perceived
and
the
dominant
or
potential
entrants
is
something
that
really
did
not
emerge
until
your
falstaff
decision.
consequently,
these
distinctions
are
not
drawn
in
the
earlier
decisions
and
that
indeed,
i
am
not
sure
that
this
is
the
case
for
example
in
the
leading
case,
the
el
paso
case
is
perfectly
obvious
that
the
northwest
pipeline
company
was
the
most
likely
entrant
because
they
were
in
there
just
trying
their
hardest
to
get
into
the
market.
there
isn't
any
question
that
they
were
an
actual
potential
entrant
ever
since
and
i
think
that
the
matter
was
well
summarized
in
the
words
of
the
court,
“unsuccessful
betters
are
a
competitors
no
less
significantly
than
successful
ones”
and
this
really
is
the
genesis
of
the
whole
potential
competition
doctrine.
mr.
lee
loevinger
they
were
perceived
indeed,
yes,
and
as
i
say
i
think
the
distinction
between
the
actual
and
the
perceived
entrant
was
not
drawn
until
we
came
to
falstaff.
now,
it
is
interesting
that
plaintiff
argues
that
commercial
banks
are
significantly
different
than
savings
banks
and
should
be
excluded
from
the
line
of
commerce
and
yet
plaintiff
or
the
department
also
argues
the
importance
of
business
financing
by
commercial
banks
is
what
makes
them
significant
and
makes
--
and
gives
them
particularly
unique
quality.
yet,
when
we
come
around
and
talk
about
the
advantages
of
these
mergers,
when
we
talk
about
the
services
and
the
competition
to
be
secured
from
these
mergers,
the
department
tells
us
that
“well,
this
is
just
a
matter
of
convenience
and
needs
and
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
competition.”
now,
i
submit
they
can’t
have
it
both
ways.
if
it
is,
business
financing,
business
services
that
make
commercial
banking
a
unique
line
of
commerce
for
the
antitrust
laws
which
have
to
do
with
competition
and
competition
only,
then
they
can’t
turn
around
and
say
but
when
you
show
us
that
a
merger
gives
you
greater
services
to
the
business
community
that
is
an
unimportant
for
purposes
of
competition.
if
it
is
important
for
purposes
of
distinguishing
the
line
of
commerce
as
a
line
--
as
a
competitive
line
of
commerce,
it
is
also
important
for
appraising
the
effects
of
the
merger
upon
competition
in
the
line
of
commerce
as
well
as
the
section
of
the
country.
now,
the
department
also
argues
that
competitive
effect
may
be
found
in
a
section
of
the
country
that
is
not
a
market.
i
confess
that
there
is
part
of
this
that
eludes
me.
i
have
always
understood
from
all
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
i
have
searched
the
decisions
of
this
court
on
this
subject,
the
section
of
the
country
and
relevant
geographic
market
review
synonymously.
in
some
cases,
one
is
used
after
the
other
in
parenthesis.
this
court
has
never
differentiated
and
what
it
said
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
was
that
we
were
to
look
to
the
area
in
which
the
impact
of
the
merger
would
be
felt
in
order
to
determine
the
relevant
geographic
market
or
the
section
of
the
country.
now,
that
is
what
the
court
did
here.
the
court
said
that
in
the
state
of
connecticut,
there
are
two
dominant
statewide
banks,
hartford
and
cbt
and
that
if
we
permit
this
merger
there
will
be
another
statewide
bank
that
will
increase
the
number
of
statewide
competitors
to
three.
therefore,
the
impact
of
the
merger
will
be
felt
in
the
state
as
a
section
of
the
country.
that
is
why
i
would
look
to
this.
now,
this
doesn’t
mean
that
aren’t
local
markets.
i
think
that
is
complete
non-secreter.
there
may
well
be
in
local
markets,
if
two
banks
within
new
haven
or
within
bridgeport
were
seeking
to
merge,
i
think
we
might
well
look
to
bridgeport
or
new
haven
as
markets
because
that
is
where
the
impact
of
the
merger
would
be
felt.
but
simply
because
the
impact
is
felt
on
the
state
level,
the
court
properly
applying
the
teachings
of
this
court
in
philadelphia
said
that’s
where
i
look
to
see
what
impact
this
merger
is
going
to
have.
to
conclude
from
this
that
every
firm
within
that
market
is
necessarily
an
actual
competitor
is
again
a
complete
non-secreter.
and
as
in
my
brief,
i
referred
to
von’s
grocery,
although
i
think
it
is
a
little
easier
for
me
to
talk
about
the
washington
metropolitan
area
because
i
know
it
better.
in
washington
as
in
los
angeles
there
are
half
a
dozen,
i
don’t
know
how
many,
but
a
certain
number
of
grocery
chains
that
compete
throughout
the
metropolitan
area.
we
are
all
familiar
with
them.
i
don’t
need
to
name
them.
we
probably
buy
groceries
there
everyday.
these
are
competitors
and
there’s
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
metropolitan
area
as
in
los
angeles
is
a
relevant
market
with
respect
to
possible
merger
of
these
grocery
chains.
this
doesn’t
mean
that
a
grocery
store
in
bethesda
is
a
competitor
of
one
in
alexandria
or
one
is
silver
springs
is
a
competitor
in
bethesda
or
alexandria,
or
in
false
church
or
anywhere
else
and
yet
these
communities
are
separated
no
further
than
bridgeport
and
new
haven.
to
say
that
we
have
a
relevant
geographic
market
for
purposes
of
a
merger
case
does
not
mean
that
every
from
within
that
market
is
an
actual
competitor
and
the
argument
which
is
founded
upon
that
attempted
logic
is
utterly
without
foundation
and
is
a
complete
non-secreter.
mr.
lee
loevinger
country,
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
that
is
correct
sir
and
in
fact
--
but
has
been
admitted
by
the
department,
what
court
found
here
is
that
there
is
no
actual
competition
at
all
between
the
geographic,
between
the
merging
banks.
therefore,
the
court
said,
in
fact,
the
total
phrase
in
philadelphia
as
i
recall
was
we
look
to
the
area
of
competitive
overlap
and
the
area
where
the
impact
of
the
merger
may
be
felt.
since
there
is
no
area
of
competitive
overlap,
the
court
said
i
look
to
the
area
where
the
impact
of
the
merger
may
be
felt.
mr.
lee
loevinger
and
he
found
the
whole
state,
that
is
correct.
mr.
lee
loevinger
he
found
that
he
is
not.
that’s
correct
sir,
yes,
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
now
there
is
non-involved
in
the
cases
that
come
to
this
court
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lee
loevinger
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
comptroller
found
out
and
eliminated
it
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
there
was
some
that
was
eliminated.
yes,
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
it’s
not
here
now.
mr.
lee
loevinger
indeed,
the
department
of
justice
tried
to
argue
that
and
that
was
disproved
because
of
the
home
office
protection
law.
this
is
one
of
the
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
there
just
weren’t
any
places
left
that
they
would
have
there.
this
is
one
of
the
interesting
aspects
of
this
case,
of
these
two
cases
as
it
comes
to
this
court,
it
is
an
aspect
which
all
together
distinguishes
both
cases
from
briley
(ph)
incidentally.
in
briley
there
were
simply
no
question
that
the
holding
company
could
have
entered
briley
de
novo
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned.
i
don’t
comment
on
the
economic
factors,
but
clearly
they
could
have
entered
briley
so
far
as
the
law
is
concerned.
in
both
of
these
cases,
there
are
legal
barriers
which
would
have
to,
which
would
require
to
be
circumvented
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
is
somewhat
unseemly
of
the
department
of
justice
to
be
arguing
that
the
banks
should
resort
to
legal
strategy
as
to
circumvent
the
requirements
of
the
state
law
which
are
designed
to
protect
state
banks
and
to
maintain
the
dual
banking
system
which
has
given
us
the
tremendous
amount
of
competition
that
in
fact
we
do
have
now.
indeed,
as
mr.
freeman
said
--mr.
freedman
said,
“congress
did
not
give
the
control
over
albeit
to
section
7.”
let
me
reply
that
congress
certainly
did
not
give
the
department
of
justice
control
over
banking
entrant.
on
the
contrary,
it's
specifically
provided
that
the
department
of
justice
should
comment
only
the
competitive
factors
involved
in
bank
merger
cases
and
that
the
decisions
should
be
made
by
the
court
as
i
have
pointed
out.
in
whitney,
this
court
said
that
the
lower
court
should
not
even
get
into
this
matter.
that
these
are
matters
for
administrative
weighing
before
they
ever
come
into
the
court
and
there
are
whole
series
of
cases
cited
in
our
brief
beginning
with
the
walker
bank
case
decided
by
this
court
in
which
the
courts
have
said
that
when
any
of
the
banking
agencies
attempt
to
evade
or
circumvent
the
state
law
restrictions
which
are
incorporated
by
reference
by
the
federal
law
that
they
are
acting
beyond
their
power
and
acting
improperly
and
that
the
courts
will
prevent
them
from
doing
so.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
unseemly
for
a
government
agency
now
to
be
suggesting
that
the
banking
agencies
or
the
bank
themselves
should
be
attempting
to
do
that
which
this
court
has
strongly
suggested
in
walker
bank
and
other
cases
that
the
banking
agency
should
not
be
engaged
in.
mr.
lee
loevinger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
let
me
first
to
answer
a
question
which
i
believe
was
asked
by
mr.
justice
stewart
as
to
the
genesis
of
potential
competition.
my
research
indicates
it
has
been
considered
in
six
cases
of
which
the
first
the
el
paso
case.
the
six
cases
are
el
paso,
continental
can,
penn-olin
which
was
the
third
case,
proctor
and
gamble,
ford
and
falstaff.
falstaff
is
the
first
case
in
which
in
this
court
gave
rather
plenary
consideration
to
it.
the
cases
are
discussed,
beginning
at
page
76
of
our
brief
in
this
case.
the
six
cases
just
mentioned
are
summarized
at
pages
82
and
83.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
has
been
some
--
there’s
obviously
a
conflict
as
there
are
always
is
in
cases
coming
to
this
court,
but
there
is
a
matter
here
that
involves
an
apparent
conflict
of
philosophy
between
government
agencies.
clearly,
the
banking
agencies,
comptroller
of
the
currency,
and
the
department
of
justice
are
in
conflict
and
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
it
might
be
useful
if
i
could
without
really
tying
anybody
down
to
anything,
try
to
analyze
the
phases
of
this
conflicting
philosophy.
the
department
argues
in
this
case
that
if
large,
healthy
banks
like
connecticut
national
and
first
new
haven
are
permitted
to
expand
by
merger.
that
the
result
will
be
a
statewide
structure
in
which
most
local
markets
will
be
nominated
by
a
few
large
banks.
now,
i
suggest
that
this
is
a
much
more
likely
result
if
these
banks
are
not
permitted
to
expand
by
merger.
as
the
department
itself
admits,
there
is
in
the
nature
of
local
markets,
there
are
relatively
few
banks.
you
can’t
talk
about
local
banking
markets
and
banking
as
one
of
the
most
competitive
fields
in
the
united
states.
you
can’t
talk
about
local
banking
market
because
all
you
were
taking
about
the
national
beer
market
as
you
are
falstaff.
in
fact
a
remarkable
coincidence
is
that
in
falstaff
there
were
10
actual
or
potential
competitors
in
a
national
beer
market
where
as
in
a
tiny
little
state
like
connecticut,
the
third
smallest
state
in
united
states,
they
are
still
talking
about
10
competitors.
well,
when
you
get
it
down
to
little
local
markets,
you
don’t
get
large
numbers
and
if
you
confine
these
banks
by
forbidding
mergers
which
you
aren’t
going
to
get
are
dominant
local
banks.
there
is
simply
no
question
about
this
in
my
mind.
let
me
try
to
illustrate
it
by
posing
two
alternative
concepts.
these
are
admittedly
highly
hypothetical.
they
correspond
only
roughly
to
reality
because
you
can't
construct
a
hypothetical
that
really
corresponds
to
all
of
the
aspects
of
reality.
but
let
us
a
take
a
state
that
has
50
towns
in
it.
each
one
of
which
has
two
banks,
so
that
there
is
competition
among
each
of
these
two
banks.
there
are
no
large
dominant
banks,
no
large
dominant
cities.
every
bank
has
approximately
1%
of
the
banking
business
in
the
state.
according
to
the
department’s
theory,
the
state
is
competitive
because
nobody
has
more
than
1%
but
every
single
banking
market
in
the
state,
each
town
is
concentrated
because
there
are
only
two
banks,
and
two
banks
have
a
100%.
now,
let
us
take
an
alternative
thing.
let
us
say
that
by
some
miracle
of
legal
transmutation,
administrative
and
legal
action
that
there
are
a
whole
lot
of
mergers
in
this
state
and
that
the
50
or
rather
the
100
banks
in
the
state
merge
into
10
statewide
banks,
10
much
larger
statewide
banks
and
that
as
a
result
of
this,
they
decide
to
branch
out,
and
so
each
of
them
establishes
branches
in
a
number
not
in
all,
but
in
a
number
of
states,
so
we
end
up
with
let
us
say
hypothetically
each
town
has
five
banks.
there
are
250
banking
offices
in
the
state,
as
opposed
to
a
100
banking
offices
previously.
now,
the
department
tells
us
that
the
difference
in
banking
offices
don’t
make
any
difference,
but
each
town
now
has
five
baking
offices,
each
representing
a
different
bank.
the
state
on
the
other
hand
has
only
10
banks.
the
same
number
as
competitors
that
were
nationally
in
falstaff.
on
the
state
basis,
they
would
say
that
there
is
concentration
because
10
banks
have
a
100%.
indeed
there
is
likely
to
be
some
asymmetry
and
it
is
likely
that
five
banks
have
a
little
bit
more
than
50%,
so
they
tell
the
state
bank
that
this
is
concentrated.
on
a
local
basis,
there
is
less
concentration
certainly
because
each
locality
has
five
banks,
although
five
banks
still
have
a
100%
which
according
to
the
definitions
and
test
we
have
been
given
is
still
concentration
and
yet
i
submit
to
the
court
“which
way
is
the
public
being
better
served?
having
five
alternatives,
five
competitors
available
in
every
town
to
every
bank
customer
or
having
two
little
banks?”
now,
i
submit
that
this
is
the
basic
conflict
in
philosophy
between
the
department
of
justice
and
the
comptroller
here.
that
the
department
says
that
a
larger
number
of
smaller
limited
service,
limited
competition
banks
is
preferable
whereas
the
comptroller
without
making
any
arbitrary
commitments
as
to
number
says
that
a
generally
smaller
number
of
larger
full
service,
fully
competitive
banks
will
better
serve
the
public
interest.
now,
reality
is
always
far
more
complex
than
these
hypothesis,
but
i
think
that
what
this
does
illustrate
is
that
simple
per
se
rules
just
don’t
work
and
very
often
will
in
fact
work
to
frustrate
the
very
objective
that
they
are
thought
to
be
serving.
indeed,
in
some
respects
you
can
see
this
in
connecticut
here.
we
have
been
given
a
test
by
mr.
shapiro
that
the
market
is
concentrated
if
the
top
ten
have
80%
or
more
or
if
the
top
five
have
40%
or
more
of
the
market
and
he
applies
this
and
says
“we’ve
got
a
concentrated
market
in
connecticut.”
well,
let’s
look
at
the
facts.
the
connecticut
national
and
the
first
new
haven,
the
merging
banks
here,
their
share
of
commercial
bank
deposits
and
i
refer
only
to
those
because
i
don’t
think
the
line
of
commerce
makes
any
difference
here,
that
their
share
of
commercial
bank
deposits
from
1959
to
1972
declined
from
13.8%
to
10.3%.
they
have
a
declining
share
of
total
state
commercial
bank
deposits.
the
hartford
national
and
connecticut
bank
and
trust,
the
two
giant
hartford
banks
have
34.5%
in
1959,
but
41.3%
in
1972.
consequently,
if
you
are
looking
for
the
40%
test
of
the
top
five,
you
can
add
any
other
three
to
the
hartford
bank
and
cbg
and
you
get
over
40%.
now,
i
submit
again
that
this
simply
beggar's
common
sense
that
you
cannot
say
because
the
two
leaders
are
increasing
their
percentage
that
their
competitors
should
be
precluded
for
merging.
if
there
is
any
sense
at
all
to
this
notion
of
structure
as
a
test
of
competitive
performance,
it
must
be
that
increasing
concentration
forecloses
merger
to
those
who
are
in
the
increasingly
concentrated
segment
to
the
growing
segment
of
the
market
not
to
those
who
are
in
the
diminishing
segment.
simply
makes
no
sense
to
say
that
because
our
two
big
competitors
are
increasing
their
share,
that
therefore,
we
will
foreclose
the
opportunity
to
merge
to
the
two
smaller
banks
and
indeed
this
is
the
very
hypothesis
that
was
rejected
in
brown
shoe
in
the
quotation
that
i
read
earlier
and
that
is
cited
in
our
brief.
justice
white
asked,
“what
is
the
difference
between
the
first
and
the
second
in
rank
and
perhaps
those
lower
in
rank
among
potential
entrants,
either
from
the
viewpoint
of
a
perceived
or
an
actual
future
potential
entrant?”
i
think
i
might
answer
that
slightly
differently
than
mr.
reycraft.
i
think
there
is
a
difference.
i
think
we
all
generally
agree
or
at
least
we
assume
as
a
matter
of
antitrust
law
that
if
you
have
more
competitors,
you
have
more
competition.
if
have
only
got
one
or
two
competitors,
you
are
less
likely
to
have
strong
competition
in
a
market
than
if
you
have
10
or
15
in
most
markets
in
most
circumstances
at
least.
however,
what
is
true
of
the
actual
competitors
is
not
necessarily
true
of
potential
competitors.
potential
competitor
exerts
whatever
influence
he
exerts
by
virtue
of
the
perception
of
those
in
the
market.
the
perception
of
those
or
in
the
case
of
the
actual
potential
competitor
as
a
future
possibility,
but
the
perception
of
those
in
the
market
is
obviously
fastened
on
the
number
possible
entrant
and
whether
there
are
15
or
20
or
30
lined
up
behind
them
which
seem
to
make
a
very
little
difference.
indeed,
if
you
will
look
at
the
economic
literature
on
the
subject,
it
does
indeed
say
and
there
is
even
some
recognition
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
that
the
significant
potential
entrant
is
the
most
likely
potential
entrant
and
maybe
this
holds
true
of
the
first
or
second,
i
don’t
know
how
far
down
the
line
you
go,
but
after
you
pass
one
or
two
potential
entrants,
those
in
line
behind
really
lose
all
significance.
mr.
lee
loevinger
well,
it
is
--
the
cases
referred
to
the
most
likely
entrant
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
lee
loevinger
this
may
be
the
discussion
in
those
cases.
i
do
not
recollect
with
that
degree
of
sharpness,
but
the
distinction
between
the
actual
or
perceived
and
the
dominant
or
potential
entrants
is
something
that
really
did
not
emerge
until
your
falstaff
decision.
consequently,
these
distinctions
are
not
drawn
in
the
earlier
decisions
and
that
indeed,
i
am
not
sure
that
this
is
the
case
for
example
in
the
leading
case,
the
el
paso
case
is
perfectly
obvious
that
the
northwest
pipeline
company
was
the
most
likely
entrant
because
they
were
in
there
just
trying
their
hardest
to
get
into
the
market.
there
isn't
any
question
that
they
were
an
actual
potential
entrant
ever
since
and
i
think
that
the
matter
was
well
summarized
in
the
words
of
the
court,
“unsuccessful
betters
are
a
competitors
no
less
significantly
than
successful
ones”
and
this
really
is
the
genesis
of
the
whole
potential
competition
doctrine.
mr.
lee
loevinger
they
were
perceived
indeed,
yes,
and
as
i
say
i
think
the
distinction
between
the
actual
and
the
perceived
entrant
was
not
drawn
until
we
came
to
falstaff.
now,
it
is
interesting
that
plaintiff
argues
that
commercial
banks
are
significantly
different
than
savings
banks
and
should
be
excluded
from
the
line
of
commerce
and
yet
plaintiff
or
the
department
also
argues
the
importance
of
business
financing
by
commercial
banks
is
what
makes
them
significant
and
makes
--
and
gives
them
particularly
unique
quality.
yet,
when
we
come
around
and
talk
about
the
advantages
of
these
mergers,
when
we
talk
about
the
services
and
the
competition
to
be
secured
from
these
mergers,
the
department
tells
us
that
“well,
this
is
just
a
matter
of
convenience
and
needs
and
does
not
have
anything
to
do
with
competition.”
now,
i
submit
they
can’t
have
it
both
ways.
if
it
is,
business
financing,
business
services
that
make
commercial
banking
a
unique
line
of
commerce
for
the
antitrust
laws
which
have
to
do
with
competition
and
competition
only,
then
they
can’t
turn
around
and
say
but
when
you
show
us
that
a
merger
gives
you
greater
services
to
the
business
community
that
is
an
unimportant
for
purposes
of
competition.
if
it
is
important
for
purposes
of
distinguishing
the
line
of
commerce
as
a
line
--
as
a
competitive
line
of
commerce,
it
is
also
important
for
appraising
the
effects
of
the
merger
upon
competition
in
the
line
of
commerce
as
well
as
the
section
of
the
country.
now,
the
department
also
argues
that
competitive
effect
may
be
found
in
a
section
of
the
country
that
is
not
a
market.
i
confess
that
there
is
part
of
this
that
eludes
me.
i
have
always
understood
from
all
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
i
have
searched
the
decisions
of
this
court
on
this
subject,
the
section
of
the
country
and
relevant
geographic
market
review
synonymously.
in
some
cases,
one
is
used
after
the
other
in
parenthesis.
this
court
has
never
differentiated
and
what
it
said
in
the
philadelphia
bank
case
was
that
we
were
to
look
to
the
area
in
which
the
impact
of
the
merger
would
be
felt
in
order
to
determine
the
relevant
geographic
market
or
the
section
of
the
country.
now,
that
is
what
the
court
did
here.
the
court
said
that
in
the
state
of
connecticut,
there
are
two
dominant
statewide
banks,
hartford
and
cbt
and
that
if
we
permit
this
merger
there
will
be
another
statewide
bank
that
will
increase
the
number
of
statewide
competitors
to
three.
therefore,
the
impact
of
the
merger
will
be
felt
in
the
state
as
a
section
of
the
country.
that
is
why
i
would
look
to
this.
now,
this
doesn’t
mean
that
aren’t
local
markets.
i
think
that
is
complete
non-secreter.
there
may
well
be
in
local
markets,
if
two
banks
within
new
haven
or
within
bridgeport
were
seeking
to
merge,
i
think
we
might
well
look
to
bridgeport
or
new
haven
as
markets
because
that
is
where
the
impact
of
the
merger
would
be
felt.
but
simply
because
the
impact
is
felt
on
the
state
level,
the
court
properly
applying
the
teachings
of
this
court
in
philadelphia
said
that’s
where
i
look
to
see
what
impact
this
merger
is
going
to
have.
to
conclude
from
this
that
every
firm
within
that
market
is
necessarily
an
actual
competitor
is
again
a
complete
non-secreter.
and
as
in
my
brief,
i
referred
to
von’s
grocery,
although
i
think
it
is
a
little
easier
for
me
to
talk
about
the
washington
metropolitan
area
because
i
know
it
better.
in
washington
as
in
los
angeles
there
are
half
a
dozen,
i
don’t
know
how
many,
but
a
certain
number
of
grocery
chains
that
compete
throughout
the
metropolitan
area.
we
are
all
familiar
with
them.
i
don’t
need
to
name
them.
we
probably
buy
groceries
there
everyday.
these
are
competitors
and
there’s
no
doubt
in
my
mind
that
metropolitan
area
as
in
los
angeles
is
a
relevant
market
with
respect
to
possible
merger
of
these
grocery
chains.
this
doesn’t
mean
that
a
grocery
store
in
bethesda
is
a
competitor
of
one
in
alexandria
or
one
is
silver
springs
is
a
competitor
in
bethesda
or
alexandria,
or
in
false
church
or
anywhere
else
and
yet
these
communities
are
separated
no
further
than
bridgeport
and
new
haven.
to
say
that
we
have
a
relevant
geographic
market
for
purposes
of
a
merger
case
does
not
mean
that
every
from
within
that
market
is
an
actual
competitor
and
the
argument
which
is
founded
upon
that
attempted
logic
is
utterly
without
foundation
and
is
a
complete
non-secreter.
mr.
lee
loevinger
country,
yes
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
that
is
correct
sir
and
in
fact
--
but
has
been
admitted
by
the
department,
what
court
found
here
is
that
there
is
no
actual
competition
at
all
between
the
geographic,
between
the
merging
banks.
therefore,
the
court
said,
in
fact,
the
total
phrase
in
philadelphia
as
i
recall
was
we
look
to
the
area
of
competitive
overlap
and
the
area
where
the
impact
of
the
merger
may
be
felt.
since
there
is
no
area
of
competitive
overlap,
the
court
said
i
look
to
the
area
where
the
impact
of
the
merger
may
be
felt.
mr.
lee
loevinger
and
he
found
the
whole
state,
that
is
correct.
mr.
lee
loevinger
he
found
that
he
is
not.
that’s
correct
sir,
yes,
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
now
there
is
non-involved
in
the
cases
that
come
to
this
court
(voice
overlap)
mr.
lee
loevinger
no,
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
comptroller
found
out
and
eliminated
it
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
there
was
some
that
was
eliminated.
yes,
sir.
mr.
lee
loevinger
it’s
not
here
now.
mr.
lee
loevinger
indeed,
the
department
of
justice
tried
to
argue
that
and
that
was
disproved
because
of
the
home
office
protection
law.
this
is
one
of
the
--
mr.
lee
loevinger
there
just
weren’t
any
places
left
that
they
would
have
there.
this
is
one
of
the
interesting
aspects
of
this
case,
of
these
two
cases
as
it
comes
to
this
court,
it
is
an
aspect
which
all
together
distinguishes
both
cases
from
briley
(ph)
incidentally.
in
briley
there
were
simply
no
question
that
the
holding
company
could
have
entered
briley
de
novo
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned.
i
don’t
comment
on
the
economic
factors,
but
clearly
they
could
have
entered
briley
so
far
as
the
law
is
concerned.
in
both
of
these
cases,
there
are
legal
barriers
which
would
have
to,
which
would
require
to
be
circumvented
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
is
somewhat
unseemly
of
the
department
of
justice
to
be
arguing
that
the
banks
should
resort
to
legal
strategy
as
to
circumvent
the
requirements
of
the
state
law
which
are
designed
to
protect
state
banks
and
to
maintain
the
dual
banking
system
which
has
given
us
the
tremendous
amount
of
competition
that
in
fact
we
do
have
now.
indeed,
as
mr.
freeman
said
--mr.
freedman
said,
“congress
did
not
give
the
control
over
albeit
to
section
7.”
let
me
reply
that
congress
certainly
did
not
give
the
department
of
justice
control
over
banking
entrant.
on
the
contrary,
it's
specifically
provided
that
the
department
of
justice
should
comment
only
the
competitive
factors
involved
in
bank
merger
cases
and
that
the
decisions
should
be
made
by
the
court
as
i
have
pointed
out.
in
whitney,
this
court
said
that
the
lower
court
should
not
even
get
into
this
matter.
that
these
are
matters
for
administrative
weighing
before
they
ever
come
into
the
court
and
there
are
whole
series
of
cases
cited
in
our
brief
beginning
with
the
walker
bank
case
decided
by
this
court
in
which
the
courts
have
said
that
when
any
of
the
banking
agencies
attempt
to
evade
or
circumvent
the
state
law
restrictions
which
are
incorporated
by
reference
by
the
federal
law
that
they
are
acting
beyond
their
power
and
acting
improperly
and
that
the
courts
will
prevent
them
from
doing
so.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
unseemly
for
a
government
agency
now
to
be
suggesting
that
the
banking
agencies
or
the
bank
themselves
should
be
attempting
to
do
that
which
this
court
has
strongly
suggested
in
walker
bank
and
other
cases
that
the
banking
agency
should
not
be
engaged
in.
