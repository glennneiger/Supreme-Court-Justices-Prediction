justice

and

just

really
articulate

not?
justice

that

the

both

not

the

there

justice

well,
i
suppose
there
might
be
states
where,
as
we
don’t
know
because
we
don’t
have
a
case
and
we
don’t
have
any
record
proof,

a
state
like
rhode

might
just
be
pretty

that’s
it

delaware
might

justice

now
mr.
loevinger,
the
statute
talks
about
lessening
of
--
on
the
effect
maybe
to
lessen
competition
in
any
section
of
the
country?
justice
potter
stewart
and
i
would
agree
with
your
understanding
that
the
section
of
the
country
is
the
equivalent
of
what
the
geographic
market
phrase
you
find
in
court
opinion
and
so
on.
but
the
lessening
of
the
competition
has
to
be
in
the
section
of
the
country
or
the
geographic
market
whichever
one
you
want
to
choose
which
implies
that
there
is
a
competition
in
that
geographic
market
and
that’s
just
relevant
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
and
he
found
the
whole
state?
justice
potter
stewart
and
yet
he
certainly
didn’t
find
that
there
was
face-to-face
competition
in
all
the
state,
not
just
the
opposite.

yes.
