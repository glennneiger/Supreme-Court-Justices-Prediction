mr.
reycraft,
if
there
is
a
difference
between
actual
potential
entry
and
perceived
potential
entry,
to
which
of
these
concepts
is
your
present
argument
more
relevant
to?
it’s
the
perceived
--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
evident
but
that
isn’t
--
i
am
asking
what
about
what
you’re
talking
about?
who
is
the
most
likely
potential
entrant?
is
that
record
both
of
these
concepts?
is
it
relevant
to
the
(voice
overlap)
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that
significant
when
you
are
talking
about
an
actual
potential
entrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let’s
assume
though
that
you
have
four
actual
potential
entrants
if
you
could
--
i
know
you
say
that
it
still
here,
assume
that
they
were.
would
it
make
any
--
and
that
you
could
rank
them
first,
second,
third,
and
fourth
in
terms
of
the
likelihood
of
the
entry.
does
it
really
have
to
be
the
most
likely
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
--
but
the
government
could
show
and
did
show
it.
it
really
wouldn’t
make
so
much
difference
if
it
was
the
first
or
the
second
or
the
third
most
likely
entered,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
that’s
what
i
am
asking.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
what
we
perceived
(inaudible)
but
if
someone
actually
would
have
been
(inaudible)
even
the
third
most
likely.
actually,
if
you
could
prove
that
these
are
very
likely
independent
and
it
is
like
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
hartford
bank
would
not
be
so
--
would
be
a
substantial
if
the
government
loses
something.
justice
byron
r.
white
other
than
just
the
so
called
argument
and
objective
facts
of
the
bank
has
a
capability?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
a
fact,
we
believe
that
but
it
still
would
mean
that
the
bank
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
have
said
you
wouldn’t
agree
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
suggesting
--
i
guess
you
won’t
find
that
implications
with
respect
to
couple
of
reflective
perceived
entries?
can
you
suggest
where
it
is
at
(voice

justice
byron
r.
white
(inaudible)
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
are
well
perceived?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
found
that
there
was
some
face-to-face
competition
which
he
probably
got
rid
off?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
he
looked
around,
he
did
find
face-to-face
competition.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
but
it
was
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
might
have
been
argued
that
if
the
merger
hadn't
been
proposed,
maybe
in
10
years
there
would
have
been
more
face-to-face
competition
in
some
other
sections
of
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
there
weren’t
many
open
towns
then?
