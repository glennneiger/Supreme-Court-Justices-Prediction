mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
like
the
case
which
the
court
has
just
heard,
this
case
is
an
appeal
by
the
united
states
from
an
adverse
decision
by
the
district
court
in
a
suit
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
challenging
the
merger
of
two
banks.
like
the
preceding
case,
it
also
raises
questions
concerning
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
potential
competition
to
bank
mergers.
the
merging
banks
in
this
case
are
the
connecticut
national
bank
headquartered
in
bridgeport,
connecticut
and
the
first
new
haven
national
bank
headquartered
some
20
miles
away
in
new
haven.
the
bridgeport
and
new
haven
metropolitan
areas
are
beyond
the
new
york
city
commuter
zone
in
the
southwestern
corner
of
connecticut.
what
we’re
concerned
with
in
this
case
is
both
the
impact
of
the
merger
on
the
bridgeport
and
new
haven
metropolitan
market
and
its
impact
on
the
state
of
connecticut
as
a
whole.
this
case,
unlike
the
preceding
case
involves,
however,
a
question
as
to
the
line
of
commerce,
a
question
as
to
the
section
of
the
country,
questions
as
to
competitive
effect,
regulatory
effect,
as
well
as
convenience
and
needs.
i
will
describe
the
banks
first
and
then
i
would
like
to
briefly
give
an
overview
of
the
case
before
stating
what
the
district
court
did.
first
new
haven,
the
new
haven
bank,
has
assets
of
$333
million,
deposits
of
$272
million,
loans
of
$224
million.
it’s
the
eighth
largest
commercial
bank
in
the
state.
it’s
an
important
bank,
it
has
a
loan
limit
of
$2.3
million
and
it
operates
some
22
offices,
17
of
them
in
the
new
haven
metropolitan
area.
three
of
them
are
really
over
in
the
bridgeport
metropolitan
area.
together
--
well,
the
connecticut
national
bank,
the
acquiring
bank
is
the
state’s
fourth
largest
commercial
bank.
as
of
1972,
it
had
assets
of
$463
million
and
deposits
of
$412,
loans
of
$253
million
and
a
loan
limit
of
$2.8
million.
so
it
too
is
a
big
and
healthy
bank.
it’s
been
expanding
vigorously
through
the
bridgeport
metropolitan
area
and
it’s
gone
beyond
it.
it
has
offices
as
far
east
as
new
haven,
or
almost
in
new
haven
and
as
far
west
as
stanford.
the
two
banks,
when
they’re
put
together,
will
account
for
about
11.7%
of
the
total
deposits
in
the
state.
now
banking
in
the
state
of
connecticut
is
concentrated.
the
state
has,
i
think
as
of
this
moment,
there
are
some
72
banks
chartered
in
the
state.
at
the
time
of
trial,
i
think
it
was
61.
there
have
been
some
new
entry
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment.
the
top
ten
banks
account
for
about
83%
of
all
of
the
deposits
in
the
state
and
those
top
ten
banks
are
therefore
extremely
significant
in
the
development
of
banking
in
the
state.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
we
have
used
the
test
of
the
philadelphia
bank
case.
when
you
have
a
situation
in
which
the
top
ten
banks
in
a
particular
area
as
large
as
the
state
reach
80%,
the
top
five
banks
reach
40%
while
we
think
that
this
is
a
serious
situation
from
the
standpoint
of
concentration.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
we
would
use
it
in
a
local
market
also.
in
the
local
markets,
the
concentration
is
equally
high.
the
11
major
metropolitan
areas
in
connecticut,
the
three
largest
banks,
with
the
exception
of
norwalk,
this
is
true
anyway,
the
three
largest
banks
account
for
over
80%
of
the
deposits.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
there
are
smaller
communities
with
one
bank,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
we
recognize
it
in
the
local
community.
there
may
be
some
small
communities
that
can’t
support
more
than
one
bank
but
the
test
really
is
not
a
mechanical
one
of
population
but
a
test
of
threat
to
solvency.
congress
has,
in
effect,
prescribed
in
the
bank
merger
act
and
in
section
7
that
competition
shall
determine
what
the
structure
of
banking
should
be,
subject
to
safeguards
to
prevent
the
failure
of
banks,
to
prevent
insolvency.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not
because
the
test
of
competition
is
always
a
test
of
independent
decision
making
entities.
it’s
the
firm,
it’s
the
bank
which
is
the
competitive
measure.
banking
offices
represent
a
convenience
factor
for
the
community.
let
me
give
an
example.
suppose
you
have
a
community
with
one
bank
that
operates
two
offices
or
three
offices.
now,
that
simply
is
not
a
competitive
relationship
because
the
three
offices
are
all
owned
by
one
bank.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
have
two
banks
in
the
community,
each
operating
one
office,
then
you
do
have
competition.
so
the
competitive
measure
is
not
a
question
of
ratio
of
offices
to
population,
but
a
ratio
of
banks
to
banks.
now,
returning
then
to
the
situation
in
connecticut,
i
have
mentioned
that
the
state’s
general
deposit
situation
is
highly
concentrated,
the
ten
largest
banks
controlling
over
80%.
the
same
concentration
appears
in
the
local
markets
and
it
appears
particularly
in
the
markets
with
which
we
are
concerned,
bridgeport
and
new
haven.
the
merging
banks
here
each
have
very
large
percentages
in
their
respective
markets.
connecticut
national
has
about
40%
of
the
deposits
in
the
bridgeport
area.
first
new
haven
has
40%
of
the
deposits
in
the
new
haven
area.
now
i
am
measuring
this
by
deposits
in
the
area
because
there
are
other
banks,
the
two
hartford,
well,
i
will
come
in
a
moment
to
those.
the
banking
structure
in
the
state,
dominated
by
the
ten
largest
as
we
view
it,
has
been
changing.
there
are
two
very
large
banks
in
hartford.
they
have
been
expanding
steadily
in
a
series
of
foothold
acquisitions
and
de
novo
office
expansions.
they
moved
steadily
to
the
point
where
they
are
substantially
bigger
than
the
next
eight
banks.
then
you
come
to
another
breaking
point
in
the
state’s
banking
structure.
below
the
first
10,
the
banks
become
quite,
become
relatively
small.
so
these
first
ten
banks
are
probably
the
place
where
the
strongest
competitive
potential
is
concentrated.
the
bridgeport
and
the
new
haven
banks
that
are
merging
here
have
been
moving
toward
each
others
markets.
in
fact,
they
actually
were
in
competition
with
each
other
in
an
area
involved
in
this
case,
a
so-called
four
town
area.
a
little
to
the
north
of
new
haven
and
somewhat
to
the
east
of
bridgeport
and
that
aspect
of
the
case
led
us
to
allege
that
there
was
a
diminution
of
actual
competition,
but
the
defendants
proposed
to
the
district
court
to
divest
themselves
a
certain
of
those
offices
and
the
district
court
accepted
that
offer
so
that
that
actual
competition
factor
is
not
itself
an
issue
in
this
case.
however,
what
that
actual
competition
offer
does
show
is
that
these
two
banks
were
coming
into
conflict
with
each
other.
these
are
not
just
potential
entrants
on
some
theory
of
having
the
capacity
to
enter
the
market.
they
are
next
door
to
each
other
right
now.
they
are
on
the
edge
of
each
other’s
markets
and
they
are,
for
that
reason,
along
with
their
great
economic
strength,
the
most
likely
entrants
we
contend
into
each
other’s
markets.
the
district
court
rejected
our
arguments
on
a
number
of
grounds.
it
found
first
of
all
that
banking
in
connecticut
--
commercial
banking
in
connecticut
is
not
a
line
of
commerce.
it
concluded
that
savings
bank
competition
in
connecticut
is
so
strong
as
to
destroy
the
distinctiveness
of
commercial
banking
or
rather,
as
i
shall
argue;
it
concluded
there
was
a
broader
line
of
commerce
called
banking
which
included
both
commercial
banks
and
savings
banks.
it
also
concluded
that
the
metropolitan
areas
in
the
state
of
connecticut
are
not
banking
markets.
the
only
banking
market
it
recognized
was
the
state
as
a
whole.
when
we
contended
that
if
that
is
true
then
the
standards
of
philadelphia
bank
should
apply
to
the
concentration
that
appears
in
the
state,
the
court
rejected
this
view
on
the
ground
that
concentration
didn’t
really
apply
here
and
the
defendants
now
argue
that
well
it
doesn’t
mean
they
are
in
head
to
head
competition,
it
just
means
the
state
as
a
banking
market.
the
court
concluded
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
defendant
banks
to
enter
by
any
means
that
the
government
had
described
and
i
shall
come
to
those.
it
concluded
that
the
regulatory
factor
showed
that
competition
was
not
seriously
injured
by
any
potential
competition
contention
of
the
government
and
finally
it
sustained
the
“convenience
and
needs”
defense.
now
before
i
go
to
these
many
issues,
i
think
i
should
at
least
try
to
make
an
overview
of
what
it
is
the
government
thinks
that
you
are
doing
in
this
potential
competition
cases.
we
start
with
the
premise
that
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank,
this
court
concluded
that
section
7
applies
to
banking
and
that
concentration
ratio
is
our
primary
index
to
the
diminution
of
competition
when
banks
merge.
this
was
followed
in
1966
by
a
thorough
congressional
reexamination
of
the
problem
in
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
out
of
that
came
a
conclusion
that
the
antitrust
laws
remained
applicable
to
banking,
that
antitrust
standards
should
apply
in
banking,
subject
to
a
new
defense
the
convenience
and
needs
defense
which
was
to
apply.
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
also
provided
that
the
bank
regulatory
agencies
would
be
permitted
to
intervene
as
parties
to
defend
their
own
decisions.
now
viewing
this
history,
the
government
has
concluded
that
section
7
is
extremely
important
in
preventing
a
consolidation
of
banking
among
the
various
states
to
the
point
where
only
a
few
institutions
dominate
all
of
the
states’
banking.
in
connecticut
as
a
whole,
the
10
largest
banks
have
been
considering
merger
with
each
other
since
1968.
since
1969,
there
have
been
four
mergers
approved
by
the
regulatory
authorities
among
the
10
largest
banks.
now
the
two
merging
banks
here
are
the
fourth
and
eighth
largest
in
the
state
and
they
are
right
next
door
to
each
other.
they
have
spread
to
the
point
where
they
actually
competing
with
each
other.
each
is
a
big,
strong
and
healthy
institution
and
they
are
well
managed.
they
are
the
dominant
local
banks,
40%
of
deposits
in
their
primary
markets
in
bridgeport
and
new
haven.
those
markets
are
concentrated
and
each
bank,
therefore,
can
bring
important
new
competition
into
the
market
of
the
other,
if
they
will
come
in
by
independent
entry.
now
those
markets
are
attractive
and
each
bank
has
strong
incentives
to
expand
into
them.
so
long
as
the
attractive
and
profitable
merger
route
is
open,
however,
large
banks
will
not
give
serious
consideration
to
alternative
means
of
entry.
their
management,
anxious
to
find
merger
partners
will
squelch
any
proposals
for
independent
entry
and
their
managements
will
argue
that
we
have
to
merge
with
other
large
banks
because
we
all
have
to
grow
until
we
are
as
big
as
the
biggest
and
the
result
is
of
course
that
the
biggest
becomes
the
measure
of
the
size
of
all
of
the
banks
and
you
have
a
trend
that
cannot
be
stopped
if
this
standard
is
the
one
to
govern.
this
court
rejected
that
view
in
philadelphia
bank
and
i
think
it
did
so
rightly.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
because
potential
competition
is
a
doctrine
i
think
that
lawyers
instinctively
react
hostilely
to.
it’s
an
economist’s
concept.
i
think
part
of
the
doctrine
is
very
well
stated,
one
side
of
the
doctrine
is
well
stated
in
the
brief
for
connecticut
national
bank
where
the
wings
aspect
of
the
doctrine
is
summarized.
the
other
aspect,
the
de-concentrating
aspect
is
really
not
just
an
economist’s
concept,
it
is
a
concept
which
is
derived
from
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
because
it’s
a
concept
which
aims
at
section
7’s
purpose,
as
this
court
described
in
brown
shoe
to
stop
the
rising
trend
toward
concentration
so
the
government
has
taken
potential
competition
and
argued
you
can
use
that
as,
you
can
use
section
7
through
the
potential
competition
doctrine
as
a
device
to
channel
the
desirable
expansion
of
banks
into
pro-competitive
directions.
most
courts
simply
find
this
novel.
it’s
much
the
same
with
many
of
the
other
antitrust
laws.
in
the
beginning,
people
had
difficulty
with
them.
but
it’s
a
very
american
concept,
your
honor,
that
we
should
have
an
atmosphere
of
competition
and
that
the
structure
of
industry
should
not
be
decided
by
administrative
or
judicial
fiat.
someone
saying
as
the
district
court
here
did,
that
there
should
be
four
or
five
large
banks
in
the
state.
rather
structure
is
to
be
determined
by
the
processes
of
competition
and
that’s
what
congress
decided
when
it
made
section
7
applicable
to
bank
mergers,
not
just
reiterating
the
general
view
that
an
administrative
agency
must
give
attendance
to
the
doctrines
of
antitrust
but
rather
making
it
specifically
applicable.
now
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
first
statement
of
it
was
in
the
pen-olin
case.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
think
the
court
has
been
ahead
of
the
economist,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
this
respect
and
although
there
was
in
the
pen-olin
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
in
the
in
the
pen-olin
decision,
there
actually
is
a
reference
to
one
of
the
t&ac
report
which
initially
summarized
the
doctrine
and
there
are
traces
of
it
in
earlier
cases,
although
it
really
received
its
first
general
recognition.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
the
pen-olin
case.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
was
one
side
of
it,
the
wings
aspect.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
no,
wings
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
wings,
that’s
right.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes
sir.
there
is
a
general
review
of
it
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
falstaff
which
sets
forth
the
different
categories
and
how
they
were
recognized.
well
to
return
just
briefly
to
my
overall
summary.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no
that’s
a
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
we
think
it
is
genesis
in
the
general
policy
of
competition.
but
what
we’re
concerned
about
mainly,
the
reason
we
keep
finding
these
genesis
is
that
section
7
is,
as
we
see
it,
something
to
channel
its
expansive
force,
that
the
banks
are
undergoing
now
into
pro-competitive
direction
so
that
you
will
determine
banking
structure
by
the
pro-competitive
entry
of
banks
now
the
large
banks
in
this
case
claim
that
they
have
to
merge
because
they
have
to
meet
the
competition
of
the
great
banks
in
hartford,
they
say
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
there
is
a
shadow
of
new
york
city,
they
contend.
we
have
to
meet
that.
well,
i
think
the
shadow
of
new
york
city
is
somewhat
overstated,
but
on
the
competition
with
the
hartford
banks,
they
say
they
can’t
really
make
it
unless
they
can
get
bigger,
that
they
can’t
enter
any
other
markets
unless
they
get
bigger.
i
just
like
to
point
out
that
since
this
case
was
tried
in
connecticut,
there
has
now
been
eight
new
bank
charters
issued
and
five
of
those
bank
charters
are
in
the
bridgeport
metropolitan
area.
now
when
district
court
said,
“well,
you
see
you
don’t
have
to
worry
about
potential
competition
because
there
will
be
new
banks
coming
in
all
the
time.”
but
of
course
those
are
very
small
banks
and
the
defendants
were
very
large
banks
say
we
can’t
overcome
the
economic
barriers
to
get
into
these
markets
when
the
little
banks
can
and
these
big
banks
would
bring
a
much
more
important
competitive
contribution
for
the
very
reasons
they
claim
that
they
have
to
meet
the
competition
of
the
hartford
banks
which
over
the
state
wide
area
has
such
important
resources.
now
what
the
effect
of
this
merger
trend
in
connecticut
is
going
to
do
is
to
increase
statewide
concentration
and
create
a
danger
with
the
system
wide
pricing
that
is
characteristic
in
connecticut,
but
you’re
going
to
have
a
statewide
oligopoly.
it
will
deny
the
bridgeport
and
new
haven
markets
the
competitive
benefits
of
independent
entry
by
these
large
banks
which
are
poised
right
at
the
doorstep
and
it
invites
other
mergers
from
the
few
remaining
banks.
in
fact
the
fourth
merger
approved
by
regulatory
agency
was
approved
on
april
4
and
it’s
a
merger
of
the
third
largest
and
ninth
largest
bank
in
the
state.
i
don’t
see
how,
under
the
standards
the
district
court
adopted
here,
the
antitrust
division
or
the
regulatory
agencies
are
going
to
be
able
to
apply
the
antitrust
laws
as
they
must
to
stop
this
trend
and
now
i
would
like
to
turn
specifically
to
the
issues
in
the
case.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
was
about
to
turn
to
the
specifics
of
the
case,
the
district
court’s
rulings
on
line
of
commerce
in
section
of
the
country,
the
problem
of
condition
of
entry,
competitive
effects
and
convenience
and
needs.
with
respect
to
the
line
of
commerce,
the
district
court
found
that
there
is
in
connecticut
a
broad
line
of
commerce
called
banking,
consisting
of
the
commercial
banks
and
the
mutual
savings
banks.
we
need
not,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
contest
the
existence
of
this
broad
line
of
commerce,
or
as
we
view
the
matter,
under
this
court’s
decision
in
united
states
against
continental
can,
the
existence
of
the
broader
line
of
commerce
does
not
preclude
the
existence
of
the
more
specific
lines,
commercial
banking
and
other
types
of
financial
institutions.
in
fact
in
the
phillipsburg
case,
this
court
recognized
that
there
was
significant
competition
among
thrift
institutions
for
the
same
kind
of
business
that
the
small
banks
in
the
phillipsburg
area
were
competing
for.
now
the
commercial
banking
business
in
connecticut
has
been
cutting
into
the
province
of
the
savings
banks,
particularly
with
respect
to
competition
for
real
estate
loans.
today
those
--
there’s
no
doubt
that
savings
banks
and
commercial
banks
in
the
state
of
connecticut
compete
for
real
estate
loans.
they
also
compete
for
some
types
of
personal
loans
and
they
have
competed
for
time
and
savings
deposits,
but
there
isn’t
a
significant
difference
of
kind
involved.
savings
banks
in
connecticut
are
important,
there
are
68
of
them
and
the
have
total
deposits,
i
think
slightly
greater
than
the
total
deposits
of
the
state’s
commercial
banks.
but
dr.
miles
the
vice
president
of
the
savings
bank
association,
explaining
the
role
that
savings
banks
in
the
state
said
that
they
are
focused
primarily
on
service
to
the
individual
and
the
family.
95%
of
the
business
of
the
loans
of
savings
banks
are
real
estate
loans
and
only
5%
is
in
the
other
category.
64%
of
the
business
of
commercial
banks
is
in
a
non
real
estate
loans.
the
big
area
for
commercial
banks,
the
distinctive
area
is
of
course
the
commercial
and
industrial
loan.
savings
banks
just
are
not
a
competitive
factor
in
this
area
in
connecticut.
i
think
they
loan
some
$26
million
in
what
they
classify
as
commercial
and
industrial
loans
and
this
is
less
than
one
half
or
1%
of
their
total
loans.
and
of
course
savings
banks
don’t
offer
any
of
the
special
services
that
commercial
banks
do,
the
very
special
services
which
the
district
court
in
this
case
used
under
the
convenience
and
needs
defense
to
justify
the
merger.
there
are
no
savings
banks
trusts,
there
are
no
savings
banks
computer
services,
there
are
no
service
for
savings
banks
corporate
services
to
business.
even
in
the
loan
area,
savings
banks
are
quite
limited
in
their
function,
they
can
only
loan
up
to
8%
of
their
assets
for
personal
expenditure
loans.
commercial
banks
are
not
restricted
in
this
way.
well,
i
could
go
on
but
it
boils
down
really
to
again
a
distinction
between
the
unique
capacity
of
commercial
banks
on
the
one
hand
and
the
--
particularly
in
serving
commercial
business
and
the
very
useful
and
important
competition
that
savings
banks
have
in
the
area
of
serving
the
family
and
the
individual
and
those
who
want
to
borrow
on
real
estate
or
for
real
estate
purposes.
now
there
is
another
important
development
in
connecticut
that
was
quite
significant
in
the
district
court’s
opinion.
the
state
of
connecticut
adopted
subsequent
to
the
trial
in
this
case
a
statute
permitting
savings
banks
to
enter
the
area
up
to
now
exclusively
the
preserve
of
the
commercial
banks,
the
demand
deposit.
connecticut
savings
banks
will
be
able,
after
1976,
though
still
not
in
effect
yet,
to
offer
personal
checking
accounts.
they
will
be
able
to
offer
these
only
to
individuals,
however,
and
only
for
personal
use,
not
for
business
purposes.
of
course,
demand
deposits
in
commercial
banks
are
not
so
limited.
moreover,
experience
elsewhere
has
indicated
that
checking
account
powers
held
by
savings
banks
does
not
mean
a
mass
exodus
from
commercial
banks
to
savings
banks
to
use
some
of
the
words
of
dr.
miles.
the
states
of
new
jersey
and
connecticut
both
permit
savings
banks
checking
accounts
and
they
also
permit
them
on
a
somewhat
broader
scale
in
connecticut
because
in
those
states
business
savings
accounts
are
allowed.
nonetheless,
looking
at
them
only
as
--
looking
at
checking
accounts
only
as
a
proportion
of
the
savings
banks
accounts
is
relative,
it’s
quite
low,
i
think
it’s
only
5
or
6%.
so
it’s
unlikely
that
the
competition,
while
it’s
important
and
useful
and
desirable
is
going
to
destroy
the
distinctive
nature
of
commercial
banking
in
connecticut.
now
we’ve
approached
this
case
from
the
standpoint
of
philadelphia
bank
in
phillipsburg
which
recognized
commercial
banking
as
a
distinctive
line
of
commerce.
we
did
not
argue
that
commercial
banking
is
a
line
of
commerce
as
a
matter
of
law.
we
had,
we
would
have
objected
to
the
introduction
of
evidence
on
this
issue.
we
did
contend
that
this
is
the
starting
place.
we
showed
that
commercial
banks
in
connecticut
are
just
like
the
commercial
banks
in
the
rest
of
the
country,
and
that
therefore,
there
is
a
sufficient
basis
to
treat
them
as
a
distinctive
line
of
commerce.
now,
once
we
were
past
the
line
of
commerce
problem
though,
we
had
to
consider
the
section
of
the
country.
we
approach
that
as
we
had,
most
other
banking
cases,
we
look
to
a
metropolitan
area
or
region
as
being
a
practical
compromise
between
very
large
customers
and
very
small
customer
banks
and
we
suggested
that
the
proper
measure
was
the
metropolitan
area
in
bridgeport
and
the
metropolitan
area
in
new
haven,
consisting
of
a
central
city,
the
cities
of
new
haven
and
bridgeport
respectively
and
the
surrounding
towns
and
we
used
a
general
measure,
the
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area
or
smsa
which
is
a
useful
device.
it
requires
that
there
would
be
a
central
city
of
not
less
than
50,000
population,
surrounding
towns
of
not
less
than
15,000
population,
not
more
than
15,000
population,
no
less.
and
that
there
be
a
commutation
on
a
significant
basis,
25%
out
from
the
town,
in
from
the
suburbs
into
the
town
and
15%
out
from
the
town
into
the
suburbs.
we
thought
this
was
a
practical
test
in
this
area
because
in
this
area,
metropolitan
areas
are
small.
we
are
not
dealing
with
great,
small
--
sprawling
agglomerates
as
in
washington
metropolitan
area
or
new
york
city
or
even
philadelphia.
it
was
relatively
small
close
end
area.
now
the
smsa
concept
is
not
ipso
facto
definition
of
a
banking
market.
it’s
just
a
tool,
but
we
thought
it
was
a
practical
one
and
so
we
used
that
as
our
test.
the
district
court
rejected
it
because
we
did
not
show
what
percentage
of
accounts
from
within
the
metropolitan
area,
actually
were
in
the
banks
in
that
metropolitan
area
and
the
reason
we
did
not
show
it
is
because
we
couldn’t
show
it.
the
only
way
you
can
get
that
kind
of
information
is
by
taking
a
full
scale
census
of
the
smsa
or
having
some
wondrous
computer
work
done
by
all
of
the
banks
involved
at
great
expense.
in
fact,
what
we
did
in
this
case,
the
difficulty
what’s
required
is
demonstrated
by
the
experience
that
the
defendants
had
with
the
new
york
banks.
defendants
argue
new
york
banks
are
a
factor
in
this
market
and
they
wanted
to
show
the
extent
to
which
accounts
from
connecticut.
people
in
connecticut
had
taken
their
business
to
the
new
york
banks.
so
they
asked
the
new
york
banks
for
statement
of
addresses
broken
down
in
various
ways
and
the
new
york
banks,
the
six
leading
banks
in
the
country
and
possibly
the
world,
the
most
modern
world,
simply
could
not
do
it
in
the
time
available
at
the
cost
involved
and
we
had
to
settle
for
less.
so
the
government,
what
it
did
do
is
prevail
upon
the
defendants
at
least
to
show
by
a
sampling
of
their
headquarters’
offices
and
some
of
the
surrounding
towns
just
what
percentage
of
the
business
arose
within
the
smsa
in
these
sample
offices
and
the
results
were
not
surprising,
about
80%
to
use
an
average
of
the
business
was
within
the
smsa.
now,
we
thought
therefore
that
we
had
proved
that
metropolitan
areas
are
a
proper
market.
the
district
court
rejected
this
and
said
that
the
only
market
is
the
state
at
large.
now
this
is
a
very
surprising
view
because
it
means
that
you
don’t
have
local
banking
markets
in
connecticut
for
any
practical
purpose,
you
just
have
a
great
big
thing
called
the
state
at
large.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor.
the
size
of
the
state
while
it
is
a
factor,
well
just
doesn’t
mean
that
there
aren’t
local
banking
markets.
to
illustrate
the
defendants
in
this
case
contend
that
the
philadelphia
bank
standards
should
not
be
applied
to
them
because
on
a
statewide
basis.
they
say
the
state
is
the
market
but
philadelphia
bank
should
not
be
applied
to
them
because
they
aren’t
head
to
head
competitors.
they
are
not
competing
with
each
other.
so
they
are
really
kind
of
denying
the
existence
of
a
statewide
market
in
any
traditional
sense
and
that
sense
of
course
is
that
it'd
be
a
practical
compromise
based
on
the
customer-supplier
relationship
which
measures
an
area
of
effective
competition
among
banks.
now,
the
hartford
banks
in
hartford
do
not
compete
with
the
defendants
in
new
haven.
the
hartford
banks,
when
they
have
an
office
in
new
haven
do
compete
with
the
defendant
banks
in
new
haven
so
it
is
a
local
market
that
we
are
talking
about,
not
a
statewide.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
certainly
rhode
island
(voice
overlap).
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
rhode
island
would
come
close
although
even
there
in
the
southern
part
of
the
state
or
out
on
the
island
that
is
off
the
coast
that
might
be
possible
to
say
that
is
distinct
but
well,
hartford
is
42
miles
away
or
50
miles
away
by
car
i
think
from
new
haven
and
that’s
a
littler
far
to
go
banking.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
it
sprawls,
there
are
11
metropolitan
areas
in
the
state
and
they
are
fairly
distinctive,
we
contend.
now
there
is
the
matter
of
the
new
york
banks.
new
york
banks
cast
a
long
shadow
in
the
banking
in
our
country.
in
fact
they
cast
a
shadow
not
only
over
connecticut
but
over
in
new
england
and
the
middle
atlantic
states
in
the
country
at
large.
they
are
big
banks
and
they
are
doing
the
business
on
a
national
basis.
it’s
also
true
that
connecticut,
in
its
very
southwest
corner,
there
is
a
little
panhandle
that
sticks
out
of
southwestern
connecticut,
kind
of,
into
new
york
and
that
is
a
commuter
area.
it
probably
runs
up
a
little
beyond
stanford
and
people
who
live
in
that
area
can
get
into
new
york
city
to
work
and
do
get
into
new
york
city
to
work
and
there
are
substantial,
there
are
undoubtedly
commuter
accounts
in
the
new
york
banks
and
a
fairly
reasonable
number
of
them,
a
fairly
high
number
them.
but
when
the
defendants
brought
in
a
report
through
special
masters
appointed
by
the
district
court
on
the
effect
to
the
new
york
banks,
what
they
found
was
that
there
are
about
$487
million
in
so
called
connecticut
accounts
and
that’s
accounts
from
the
state
as
a
whole
which
were
in
the
new
york
banks,
that
is
roughly
7%
of
the
total
deposits
in
connecticut
commercial
banks,
divided
among
the
six
biggest
new
york
banks
and
then
when
we
looked
a
little
closer
at
it
we
found
this.
the
average
size
of
those
deposits
was
$20,000.00.
now
the
average
size
of
connecticut
bank
deposit
was
$1,700.00.
this
is
in
government
exhibit
130.
now,
what
this
suggests
is
that
the
new
york
banks
are
really
competing
for
the
larger
business
accounts,
that
is
where
the
bulk
of
the
big
account
is
coming
from,
that
is
where
the
bulk
of
that
money
is
coming
from.
now,
new
york
banks
compete
across
the
country,
this
was
recognized
in
philadelphia.
in
philadelphia,
the
court
excluded
the
new
york
banks
from
the
market,
saying
it
would
draw
the
market
to
a
broad
and
it
also,
despite
the
geographic
proximity,
excluded
other
states
in
the
philadelphia
area,
i
think
pennsylvania
and
delaware
and
i
think
the
same
rule
would
apply
here.
so
under
a
philadelphia
test
and
the
facts
we
show,
we
don’t
think
that
the
new
york
banks
are
the
fact
that
the
defendants
make
them.
now,
we
did
agree
that
the
state
is
a
section
of
the
country,
not
a
banking
market
in
a
traditional
buyer
seller
sense,
but
a
section
of
the
country
in
which
certain
distinctive
competitive
effects
could
be
measured
and
we
argue
that
philadelphia
bank
would
necessarily
apply.
it
applies
because
there
is
a
competitive
danger
when
these
big
banks
are
merging,
that
you
are
going
to
get
a
statewide
oligopoly.
the
defendants
deny
that.
they
say
philadelphia
shouldn’t
apply
but
they
do
not
really
explain
why,
if
the
state
as
a
market
as
they
contend,
it
shouldn’t,
except
that
they
say
we
are
not
head
to
head
competitors.
well
there
are
other
competitive
effects
besides
head
to
head.
i
turn
now
to
the
problem
of
entry
which
is
an
important
consideration
here.
i
think
the
first
important
thing
to
remember
about
entry
in
these
cases
is
that
when
a
merger
is
denied,
a
bank
will
seek
an
alternative
way
of
getting
into
a
market
which
it
says
it
can’t
get
into.
now
that’s
demonstrated
dramatically
in
this
case.
connecticut
national
attempted
to
merge
with
one
of
the
big
hartford
banks.
the
department
of
justice
sued
and
they
abandoned
the
merger.
they
told
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
in
government
exhibit
125,
in
their
application
that
there
was
no
way
that
hartford
bank
could
get
into
the
bridgeport
market,
except
by
merging
with
connecticut
national
bank
and
then
when
the
merger
was
frustrated,
the
hartford
bank
went
in
and
bought
a
little
bank
in
bridgeport
made
of
foothold
entry
into
bridgeport
city
itself
and
then
made
a
de
novo
branch
entry
into
the
city
of
fair
--
in
the
town
of
fairfield
which
was
then
an
open
town.
so
that
this
problem
of
seeking
alternatives
is
demonstrated
by
this
record
in
g.
ex.
125.
now,
there
are
three
ways
we
think
that
people
could
enter
in
connecticut.
first,
i
have
to
explain
that
under
connecticut
law,
there
is
a
home
office
protection
provision
which
says
that
a
bank
cannot
enter
another
bank’s
headquarters’
town
so
that
any
town
that
has
a
bank
headquartered
in
it
is
closed
to
de
novo
branching.
i
shouldn’t
say
can’t
enter,
i
should
say
de
novo
branching.
it
is
close
to
the
opening
of
a
new
branch
office
but
there
were
towns
around
new
haven,
there
were
towns
around
bridgeport
which
were
open
for
de
novo
entry
and
we
contend
that
if
you
view
the
area
as
a
metropolitan
area,
you
could
make
effective
entry
into
those
towns
and
be
an
effective
functioning
competitor
in
the
metropolitan
area.
a
second
method
for
entry
was
by
purchasing
a
foothold
bank.
there
are
no
foothold
banks
left
in
new
haven
because
the
hartford
banks
picked
them
up
two
years
ago,
but
there
are
foothold
banks
in
the
surrounding
towns
and
they
did
offer
a
means
of
entry.
now
the
same
thing
was
true
around
bridgeport.
what’s
happened
in
bridgeport
is
that
there
were
six
towns
open
for
entry,
five
towns
open
for
--
six
towns
open
for
entry
and
there
has
now
been
new
banks
created
in
those
towns,
fairfield,
trumbull,
some
of
the
others
and
the
result
is
that
those
towns
are
now
closed
to
de
novo
branching
because
they’ll
be
a
bank
headquartered
in
them.
but
those
new
little
banks
form
potential
foothold
entrants
so
there
is
a
way
of
getting
in
by
that
method.
finally,
there
is
the
use
of
the
holding
company
which
is
authorized
under
connecticut
law.
connecticut
does
permit
the
holding
companies.
there
is
no
reason
why
a
holding
company
could
not
sponsor.
i
shouldn’t
say
sponsor,
actually
create
a
subsidiary
and
acquire
it.
it
was
argued
that
this
might
be
illegal
but
the
comptroller.
i
am
sorry,
the
commissioner
of
banking
in
connecticut
testified
that
he
had
never
been
faced
with
this
kind
of
request
before.
the
bank
holding
company
law
in
connecticut
has
only
been
in
effect
since
1969.
in
fact,
there
were
a
couple
of
young
vice
presidents
in
the
first
new
haven
bank
who
suggested
this
route
in
1969
but
at
that
time,
first
new
haven
was
looking
around
for
a
merger
partner
and
they
were
not
about
to
be
listened
to
and
of
course
connecticut
national
was
also
engaged
in
looking
for
a
partner
among
the
top
ten
so
no
one
was
going
to
pursue
these
routes.
finally,
i
would
like
to
say
one
brief
word
about
the
convenience
and
needs
defense
in
this
case.
that
defense
was
that
there
would
be
special
banking
services
of
a
kind
which
would
serve,
particularly
in
the
interest
of
business
but
perhaps
the
shortest
and
quickest
answer
to
the
convenience
and
needs
defense
here
is
that
the
bank
examiner
who
went
out
when
the
application
for
these
banks
was
submitted,
when
the
merger
application
was
submitted.
the
bank
examiner
who
went
out
came
back
and
said
both
of
these
banks
are
adequately
serving
the
convenience
and
needs
of
their
community,
and
they
are,
they
are
good
banks
and
the
community
is
well-banked.
there
is
plenty
of
alternative
service
in
the
bridgeport
metropolitan
area
and
the
other,
and
the
final
point
on
that
issue
is
that
if
you
are
going
to
engage
in
a
balancing
of
competitive
effects
against
convenience
and
need,
you
have
got
to
be
right
about
the
competitive
effects.
our
overall
position
is
that
the
district
court
here
was
wrong
on
the
line
of
commerce,
was
wrong
on
the
section
of
the
country,
was
wrong
on
the
condition
of
entry,
failed
to
give
--
failed
to
weigh
adequately
competitive
effects
and
therefore
couldn’t
adequately
measure
convenience
and
needs.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
thank
you,
your
honor.
first
i
would
like
to
address
the
question
of
markets.
dr.
peck
who's
study
of
potential
entrants
was
referred
to
by
mr.
reycraft
conceded
that
his
study
did
not
undertake
a
study
of
banking
markets.
he
simply
looked
at
towns
as
geographic
entities.
he
also
stated
that
he
did
not
consider
the
question
of
the
effect
of
actual
entry.
he
was
simply
looking
at
the
potential
entrants
from
the
standpoint
of
the
so-called
perceived
effect
and
finally
he
said
at
the
close
of
his
cross-examination
that
he
wasn't
all
concerned
with
concentration,
he
considered
it
unimportant
in
banking.
so,
that
i
don’t
think
that
dr.
peck’s
studies
really
focused
on
the
market
question
that
he
should
have
focused
on
in
trying
to
determine
who
is
the
potential
entrant.
now
who
is
the
potential
entrant?
the
government’s
theory
was
that
the
most
significant
potential
entrants
were
in
the
top
10
banks
in
the
state.
of
those
top
10
banks,
two
of
them,
the
big
bridgeport
banks
we
said
were
already
in
the
bridgeport
in
new
haven
areas.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
big
hartford
banks.
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
hartford
national
is
actually
in
--
hartford
national
is
not
in
bridgeport,
but
it
is
in
fairfield.
so
we
say
it
is
already
in
the
metropolitan
area
and
of
course
the
other
bank
is
in
both
new
haven
and
fairfield.
now,
eliminating
the
top
two,
that
leaves
eight
and
if
you
eliminate
the
banks
that
are
not
in
new
haven
or
bridgeport,
you
get
a
very
small
number
left
and
of
those
we
then
look
to
see
who
was
large
and
close
by.
and
the
most
obvious
entrants
were
the
bridgeport
bank
moving
over
to
new
haven
and
the
new
haven
bank
moving
over
to
bridgeport
and
we
said
they
are
the
most
significant
entrants.
now,
mr.
reycraft
suggested
that
the
test
should
be
whether
the
banks
would
have
entered,
but
for
the
merger,
but
we
suggest
that
that
test
would
be
a
test
of
certainty
which
would
not
fit
the
purposes
of
section
7.
the
real
test
is
whether
--
a
test
which
would
fit
the
purposes
of
section
7,
is
whether
if
the
merger
route
is
closed,
it
is
probable
that
the
banks
would
enter
given
their
incentive
and
capacity.
and
this
is
we
think
we
demonstrated
that
they
had
the
incentive
and
that
they
had
the
capacity
that
means
of
entry
did
exist
if
they
were
encouraged
to
do
it
and
we
think
this
was
demonstrated
by
the
experience
of
the
connecticut
national
attempt
to
merge
with
the
big
hartford
bank.
the
hartford
bank
which
said
it
could
not
get
in
to
bridgeport
did
try
to
get
into
bridgeport
and
did
succeed
in
doing
so.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
in
addition
to
offering
to
divest
themselves
of
the
banks
which
were
the
subject
of
actual
competition
in
the
four-town
area.
the
defendants
at
pages
40
and
41
of
the
record
also
said
that
if
they
were
allowed
to
merge,
they
would
get
themselves
in
the
hartford.
they
said
it
would
be
difficult
legally,
but
they
would
attempt
to
find
the
way,
again
proving
that
if
the
merger
route
is
closed,
people
will
seek
an
alternative.
now,
counsel
for
the
comptroller
has
set
forth
what
he
views
as
a
difference
between
the
department
of
justice
and
his
agency
over
banking
policy.
we
suggest
that
it
is
not
a
question
of
banking
policy.
it
is
a
question
of
whether
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
which
makes
section
7
controlling
is
going
to
be
controlling
as
congress
intended.
in
the
comptroller’s
brief
at
page
54
there
is
a
note
23
which
says
that
he
favors
merger
over
entry
by
de
novo
methods
or
by
new
charters.
he
has
an
affirmative
policy
in
favor
of
merger.
now,
the
department
of
justice
believing
that
section
7
is
controlling
here
feels
that
the
test
is
not
whether
there
is
going
to
be
simply
local
oligopolies
immune
from
competition
by
expanding
banks.
we
favor
the
expansion
of
the
statewide
bank.
we
favor
its
entry
into
local
markets
that
is
our
policy,
but
the
question
is
how
it
gets
in.
if
it
goes
in
on
a
small
basis
and
has
to
fight
in
that
local
market
it's
going
to
upset
the
status
quo.
it’s
going
to
bring
the
benefits
of
competition
to
that
market.
if
it
walks
in
by
buying
a
large
share
it’s
going
to
settle
down
and
we
are
going
to
have
in
the
local
market
the
same
kind
of
oligopoly
we
had
before.
we
encourage
de
novo
entry,
we
encourage
foothold
merger.
that
is
why
we
have
not
challenged
the
expansions
by
the
big
hartford
banks
because
they
always
were
careful
to
stay
on
a
small
scale
when
they
went
into
new
markets
and
to
the
extent
that
has
happened
in
connecticut,
we
have
had
an
increase
in
local
diversity
which
we
favor,
but
the
question
is
always
how
the
expansion
is
achieved?
now,
the
comptroller
mentioned
the
washington
area
as
an
example
of
how
market
should
be
defined.
well,
i
suggest
that
the
washington
area
is
a
good
analogy
for
considering
a
metropolitan
area
as
a
banking
market.
in
this
sense,
the
suburban
banks
in
washington
cannot
get
into
the
central
city.
the
central
city
banks
cannot
get
into
the
suburbs
and
yet
there
is
genuine
competition
among
those
banks.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
like
the
case
which
the
court
has
just
heard,
this
case
is
an
appeal
by
the
united
states
from
an
adverse
decision
by
the
district
court
in
a
suit
under
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
challenging
the
merger
of
two
banks.
like
the
preceding
case,
it
also
raises
questions
concerning
the
application
of
the
doctrine
of
potential
competition
to
bank
mergers.
the
merging
banks
in
this
case
are
the
connecticut
national
bank
headquartered
in
bridgeport,
connecticut
and
the
first
new
haven
national
bank
headquartered
some
20
miles
away
in
new
haven.
the
bridgeport
and
new
haven
metropolitan
areas
are
beyond
the
new
york
city
commuter
zone
in
the
southwestern
corner
of
connecticut.
what
we’re
concerned
with
in
this
case
is
both
the
impact
of
the
merger
on
the
bridgeport
and
new
haven
metropolitan
market
and
its
impact
on
the
state
of
connecticut
as
a
whole.
this
case,
unlike
the
preceding
case
involves,
however,
a
question
as
to
the
line
of
commerce,
a
question
as
to
the
section
of
the
country,
questions
as
to
competitive
effect,
regulatory
effect,
as
well
as
convenience
and
needs.
i
will
describe
the
banks
first
and
then
i
would
like
to
briefly
give
an
overview
of
the
case
before
stating
what
the
district
court
did.
first
new
haven,
the
new
haven
bank,
has
assets
of
$333
million,
deposits
of
$272
million,
loans
of
$224
million.
it’s
the
eighth
largest
commercial
bank
in
the
state.
it’s
an
important
bank,
it
has
a
loan
limit
of
$2.3
million
and
it
operates
some
22
offices,
17
of
them
in
the
new
haven
metropolitan
area.
three
of
them
are
really
over
in
the
bridgeport
metropolitan
area.
together
--
well,
the
connecticut
national
bank,
the
acquiring
bank
is
the
state’s
fourth
largest
commercial
bank.
as
of
1972,
it
had
assets
of
$463
million
and
deposits
of
$412,
loans
of
$253
million
and
a
loan
limit
of
$2.8
million.
so
it
too
is
a
big
and
healthy
bank.
it’s
been
expanding
vigorously
through
the
bridgeport
metropolitan
area
and
it’s
gone
beyond
it.
it
has
offices
as
far
east
as
new
haven,
or
almost
in
new
haven
and
as
far
west
as
stanford.
the
two
banks,
when
they’re
put
together,
will
account
for
about
11.7%
of
the
total
deposits
in
the
state.
now
banking
in
the
state
of
connecticut
is
concentrated.
the
state
has,
i
think
as
of
this
moment,
there
are
some
72
banks
chartered
in
the
state.
at
the
time
of
trial,
i
think
it
was
61.
there
have
been
some
new
entry
which
i
will
come
to
in
a
moment.
the
top
ten
banks
account
for
about
83%
of
all
of
the
deposits
in
the
state
and
those
top
ten
banks
are
therefore
extremely
significant
in
the
development
of
banking
in
the
state.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
we
have
used
the
test
of
the
philadelphia
bank
case.
when
you
have
a
situation
in
which
the
top
ten
banks
in
a
particular
area
as
large
as
the
state
reach
80%,
the
top
five
banks
reach
40%
while
we
think
that
this
is
a
serious
situation
from
the
standpoint
of
concentration.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
we
would
use
it
in
a
local
market
also.
in
the
local
markets,
the
concentration
is
equally
high.
the
11
major
metropolitan
areas
in
connecticut,
the
three
largest
banks,
with
the
exception
of
norwalk,
this
is
true
anyway,
the
three
largest
banks
account
for
over
80%
of
the
deposits.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
there
are
smaller
communities
with
one
bank,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
we
recognize
it
in
the
local
community.
there
may
be
some
small
communities
that
can’t
support
more
than
one
bank
but
the
test
really
is
not
a
mechanical
one
of
population
but
a
test
of
threat
to
solvency.
congress
has,
in
effect,
prescribed
in
the
bank
merger
act
and
in
section
7
that
competition
shall
determine
what
the
structure
of
banking
should
be,
subject
to
safeguards
to
prevent
the
failure
of
banks,
to
prevent
insolvency.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor,
we
do
not
because
the
test
of
competition
is
always
a
test
of
independent
decision
making
entities.
it’s
the
firm,
it’s
the
bank
which
is
the
competitive
measure.
banking
offices
represent
a
convenience
factor
for
the
community.
let
me
give
an
example.
suppose
you
have
a
community
with
one
bank
that
operates
two
offices
or
three
offices.
now,
that
simply
is
not
a
competitive
relationship
because
the
three
offices
are
all
owned
by
one
bank.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
have
two
banks
in
the
community,
each
operating
one
office,
then
you
do
have
competition.
so
the
competitive
measure
is
not
a
question
of
ratio
of
offices
to
population,
but
a
ratio
of
banks
to
banks.
now,
returning
then
to
the
situation
in
connecticut,
i
have
mentioned
that
the
state’s
general
deposit
situation
is
highly
concentrated,
the
ten
largest
banks
controlling
over
80%.
the
same
concentration
appears
in
the
local
markets
and
it
appears
particularly
in
the
markets
with
which
we
are
concerned,
bridgeport
and
new
haven.
the
merging
banks
here
each
have
very
large
percentages
in
their
respective
markets.
connecticut
national
has
about
40%
of
the
deposits
in
the
bridgeport
area.
first
new
haven
has
40%
of
the
deposits
in
the
new
haven
area.
now
i
am
measuring
this
by
deposits
in
the
area
because
there
are
other
banks,
the
two
hartford,
well,
i
will
come
in
a
moment
to
those.
the
banking
structure
in
the
state,
dominated
by
the
ten
largest
as
we
view
it,
has
been
changing.
there
are
two
very
large
banks
in
hartford.
they
have
been
expanding
steadily
in
a
series
of
foothold
acquisitions
and
de
novo
office
expansions.
they
moved
steadily
to
the
point
where
they
are
substantially
bigger
than
the
next
eight
banks.
then
you
come
to
another
breaking
point
in
the
state’s
banking
structure.
below
the
first
10,
the
banks
become
quite,
become
relatively
small.
so
these
first
ten
banks
are
probably
the
place
where
the
strongest
competitive
potential
is
concentrated.
the
bridgeport
and
the
new
haven
banks
that
are
merging
here
have
been
moving
toward
each
others
markets.
in
fact,
they
actually
were
in
competition
with
each
other
in
an
area
involved
in
this
case,
a
so-called
four
town
area.
a
little
to
the
north
of
new
haven
and
somewhat
to
the
east
of
bridgeport
and
that
aspect
of
the
case
led
us
to
allege
that
there
was
a
diminution
of
actual
competition,
but
the
defendants
proposed
to
the
district
court
to
divest
themselves
a
certain
of
those
offices
and
the
district
court
accepted
that
offer
so
that
that
actual
competition
factor
is
not
itself
an
issue
in
this
case.
however,
what
that
actual
competition
offer
does
show
is
that
these
two
banks
were
coming
into
conflict
with
each
other.
these
are
not
just
potential
entrants
on
some
theory
of
having
the
capacity
to
enter
the
market.
they
are
next
door
to
each
other
right
now.
they
are
on
the
edge
of
each
other’s
markets
and
they
are,
for
that
reason,
along
with
their
great
economic
strength,
the
most
likely
entrants
we
contend
into
each
other’s
markets.
the
district
court
rejected
our
arguments
on
a
number
of
grounds.
it
found
first
of
all
that
banking
in
connecticut
--
commercial
banking
in
connecticut
is
not
a
line
of
commerce.
it
concluded
that
savings
bank
competition
in
connecticut
is
so
strong
as
to
destroy
the
distinctiveness
of
commercial
banking
or
rather,
as
i
shall
argue;
it
concluded
there
was
a
broader
line
of
commerce
called
banking
which
included
both
commercial
banks
and
savings
banks.
it
also
concluded
that
the
metropolitan
areas
in
the
state
of
connecticut
are
not
banking
markets.
the
only
banking
market
it
recognized
was
the
state
as
a
whole.
when
we
contended
that
if
that
is
true
then
the
standards
of
philadelphia
bank
should
apply
to
the
concentration
that
appears
in
the
state,
the
court
rejected
this
view
on
the
ground
that
concentration
didn’t
really
apply
here
and
the
defendants
now
argue
that
well
it
doesn’t
mean
they
are
in
head
to
head
competition,
it
just
means
the
state
as
a
banking
market.
the
court
concluded
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
defendant
banks
to
enter
by
any
means
that
the
government
had
described
and
i
shall
come
to
those.
it
concluded
that
the
regulatory
factor
showed
that
competition
was
not
seriously
injured
by
any
potential
competition
contention
of
the
government
and
finally
it
sustained
the
“convenience
and
needs”
defense.
now
before
i
go
to
these
many
issues,
i
think
i
should
at
least
try
to
make
an
overview
of
what
it
is
the
government
thinks
that
you
are
doing
in
this
potential
competition
cases.
we
start
with
the
premise
that
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank,
this
court
concluded
that
section
7
applies
to
banking
and
that
concentration
ratio
is
our
primary
index
to
the
diminution
of
competition
when
banks
merge.
this
was
followed
in
1966
by
a
thorough
congressional
reexamination
of
the
problem
in
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966.
out
of
that
came
a
conclusion
that
the
antitrust
laws
remained
applicable
to
banking,
that
antitrust
standards
should
apply
in
banking,
subject
to
a
new
defense
the
convenience
and
needs
defense
which
was
to
apply.
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
also
provided
that
the
bank
regulatory
agencies
would
be
permitted
to
intervene
as
parties
to
defend
their
own
decisions.
now
viewing
this
history,
the
government
has
concluded
that
section
7
is
extremely
important
in
preventing
a
consolidation
of
banking
among
the
various
states
to
the
point
where
only
a
few
institutions
dominate
all
of
the
states’
banking.
in
connecticut
as
a
whole,
the
10
largest
banks
have
been
considering
merger
with
each
other
since
1968.
since
1969,
there
have
been
four
mergers
approved
by
the
regulatory
authorities
among
the
10
largest
banks.
now
the
two
merging
banks
here
are
the
fourth
and
eighth
largest
in
the
state
and
they
are
right
next
door
to
each
other.
they
have
spread
to
the
point
where
they
actually
competing
with
each
other.
each
is
a
big,
strong
and
healthy
institution
and
they
are
well
managed.
they
are
the
dominant
local
banks,
40%
of
deposits
in
their
primary
markets
in
bridgeport
and
new
haven.
those
markets
are
concentrated
and
each
bank,
therefore,
can
bring
important
new
competition
into
the
market
of
the
other,
if
they
will
come
in
by
independent
entry.
now
those
markets
are
attractive
and
each
bank
has
strong
incentives
to
expand
into
them.
so
long
as
the
attractive
and
profitable
merger
route
is
open,
however,
large
banks
will
not
give
serious
consideration
to
alternative
means
of
entry.
their
management,
anxious
to
find
merger
partners
will
squelch
any
proposals
for
independent
entry
and
their
managements
will
argue
that
we
have
to
merge
with
other
large
banks
because
we
all
have
to
grow
until
we
are
as
big
as
the
biggest
and
the
result
is
of
course
that
the
biggest
becomes
the
measure
of
the
size
of
all
of
the
banks
and
you
have
a
trend
that
cannot
be
stopped
if
this
standard
is
the
one
to
govern.
this
court
rejected
that
view
in
philadelphia
bank
and
i
think
it
did
so
rightly.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
because
potential
competition
is
a
doctrine
i
think
that
lawyers
instinctively
react
hostilely
to.
it’s
an
economist’s
concept.
i
think
part
of
the
doctrine
is
very
well
stated,
one
side
of
the
doctrine
is
well
stated
in
the
brief
for
connecticut
national
bank
where
the
wings
aspect
of
the
doctrine
is
summarized.
the
other
aspect,
the
de-concentrating
aspect
is
really
not
just
an
economist’s
concept,
it
is
a
concept
which
is
derived
from
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
because
it’s
a
concept
which
aims
at
section
7’s
purpose,
as
this
court
described
in
brown
shoe
to
stop
the
rising
trend
toward
concentration
so
the
government
has
taken
potential
competition
and
argued
you
can
use
that
as,
you
can
use
section
7
through
the
potential
competition
doctrine
as
a
device
to
channel
the
desirable
expansion
of
banks
into
pro-competitive
directions.
most
courts
simply
find
this
novel.
it’s
much
the
same
with
many
of
the
other
antitrust
laws.
in
the
beginning,
people
had
difficulty
with
them.
but
it’s
a
very
american
concept,
your
honor,
that
we
should
have
an
atmosphere
of
competition
and
that
the
structure
of
industry
should
not
be
decided
by
administrative
or
judicial
fiat.
someone
saying
as
the
district
court
here
did,
that
there
should
be
four
or
five
large
banks
in
the
state.
rather
structure
is
to
be
determined
by
the
processes
of
competition
and
that’s
what
congress
decided
when
it
made
section
7
applicable
to
bank
mergers,
not
just
reiterating
the
general
view
that
an
administrative
agency
must
give
attendance
to
the
doctrines
of
antitrust
but
rather
making
it
specifically
applicable.
now
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
first
statement
of
it
was
in
the
pen-olin
case.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
i
think
the
court
has
been
ahead
of
the
economist,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
this
respect
and
although
there
was
in
the
pen-olin
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
well,
in
the
in
the
pen-olin
decision,
there
actually
is
a
reference
to
one
of
the
t&ac
report
which
initially
summarized
the
doctrine
and
there
are
traces
of
it
in
earlier
cases,
although
it
really
received
its
first
general
recognition.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
in
the
pen-olin
case.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
that
was
one
side
of
it,
the
wings
aspect.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
no,
wings
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
wings,
that’s
right.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
yes
sir.
there
is
a
general
review
of
it
in
the
concurring
opinion
in
falstaff
which
sets
forth
the
different
categories
and
how
they
were
recognized.
well
to
return
just
briefly
to
my
overall
summary.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no
that’s
a
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
we
think
it
is
genesis
in
the
general
policy
of
competition.
but
what
we’re
concerned
about
mainly,
the
reason
we
keep
finding
these
genesis
is
that
section
7
is,
as
we
see
it,
something
to
channel
its
expansive
force,
that
the
banks
are
undergoing
now
into
pro-competitive
direction
so
that
you
will
determine
banking
structure
by
the
pro-competitive
entry
of
banks
now
the
large
banks
in
this
case
claim
that
they
have
to
merge
because
they
have
to
meet
the
competition
of
the
great
banks
in
hartford,
they
say
--
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
there
is
a
shadow
of
new
york
city,
they
contend.
we
have
to
meet
that.
well,
i
think
the
shadow
of
new
york
city
is
somewhat
overstated,
but
on
the
competition
with
the
hartford
banks,
they
say
they
can’t
really
make
it
unless
they
can
get
bigger,
that
they
can’t
enter
any
other
markets
unless
they
get
bigger.
i
just
like
to
point
out
that
since
this
case
was
tried
in
connecticut,
there
has
now
been
eight
new
bank
charters
issued
and
five
of
those
bank
charters
are
in
the
bridgeport
metropolitan
area.
now
when
district
court
said,
“well,
you
see
you
don’t
have
to
worry
about
potential
competition
because
there
will
be
new
banks
coming
in
all
the
time.”
but
of
course
those
are
very
small
banks
and
the
defendants
were
very
large
banks
say
we
can’t
overcome
the
economic
barriers
to
get
into
these
markets
when
the
little
banks
can
and
these
big
banks
would
bring
a
much
more
important
competitive
contribution
for
the
very
reasons
they
claim
that
they
have
to
meet
the
competition
of
the
hartford
banks
which
over
the
state
wide
area
has
such
important
resources.
now
what
the
effect
of
this
merger
trend
in
connecticut
is
going
to
do
is
to
increase
statewide
concentration
and
create
a
danger
with
the
system
wide
pricing
that
is
characteristic
in
connecticut,
but
you’re
going
to
have
a
statewide
oligopoly.
it
will
deny
the
bridgeport
and
new
haven
markets
the
competitive
benefits
of
independent
entry
by
these
large
banks
which
are
poised
right
at
the
doorstep
and
it
invites
other
mergers
from
the
few
remaining
banks.
in
fact
the
fourth
merger
approved
by
regulatory
agency
was
approved
on
april
4
and
it’s
a
merger
of
the
third
largest
and
ninth
largest
bank
in
the
state.
i
don’t
see
how,
under
the
standards
the
district
court
adopted
here,
the
antitrust
division
or
the
regulatory
agencies
are
going
to
be
able
to
apply
the
antitrust
laws
as
they
must
to
stop
this
trend
and
now
i
would
like
to
turn
specifically
to
the
issues
in
the
case.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
was
about
to
turn
to
the
specifics
of
the
case,
the
district
court’s
rulings
on
line
of
commerce
in
section
of
the
country,
the
problem
of
condition
of
entry,
competitive
effects
and
convenience
and
needs.
with
respect
to
the
line
of
commerce,
the
district
court
found
that
there
is
in
connecticut
a
broad
line
of
commerce
called
banking,
consisting
of
the
commercial
banks
and
the
mutual
savings
banks.
we
need
not,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
contest
the
existence
of
this
broad
line
of
commerce,
or
as
we
view
the
matter,
under
this
court’s
decision
in
united
states
against
continental
can,
the
existence
of
the
broader
line
of
commerce
does
not
preclude
the
existence
of
the
more
specific
lines,
commercial
banking
and
other
types
of
financial
institutions.
in
fact
in
the
phillipsburg
case,
this
court
recognized
that
there
was
significant
competition
among
thrift
institutions
for
the
same
kind
of
business
that
the
small
banks
in
the
phillipsburg
area
were
competing
for.
now
the
commercial
banking
business
in
connecticut
has
been
cutting
into
the
province
of
the
savings
banks,
particularly
with
respect
to
competition
for
real
estate
loans.
today
those
--
there’s
no
doubt
that
savings
banks
and
commercial
banks
in
the
state
of
connecticut
compete
for
real
estate
loans.
they
also
compete
for
some
types
of
personal
loans
and
they
have
competed
for
time
and
savings
deposits,
but
there
isn’t
a
significant
difference
of
kind
involved.
savings
banks
in
connecticut
are
important,
there
are
68
of
them
and
the
have
total
deposits,
i
think
slightly
greater
than
the
total
deposits
of
the
state’s
commercial
banks.
but
dr.
miles
the
vice
president
of
the
savings
bank
association,
explaining
the
role
that
savings
banks
in
the
state
said
that
they
are
focused
primarily
on
service
to
the
individual
and
the
family.
95%
of
the
business
of
the
loans
of
savings
banks
are
real
estate
loans
and
only
5%
is
in
the
other
category.
64%
of
the
business
of
commercial
banks
is
in
a
non
real
estate
loans.
the
big
area
for
commercial
banks,
the
distinctive
area
is
of
course
the
commercial
and
industrial
loan.
savings
banks
just
are
not
a
competitive
factor
in
this
area
in
connecticut.
i
think
they
loan
some
$26
million
in
what
they
classify
as
commercial
and
industrial
loans
and
this
is
less
than
one
half
or
1%
of
their
total
loans.
and
of
course
savings
banks
don’t
offer
any
of
the
special
services
that
commercial
banks
do,
the
very
special
services
which
the
district
court
in
this
case
used
under
the
convenience
and
needs
defense
to
justify
the
merger.
there
are
no
savings
banks
trusts,
there
are
no
savings
banks
computer
services,
there
are
no
service
for
savings
banks
corporate
services
to
business.
even
in
the
loan
area,
savings
banks
are
quite
limited
in
their
function,
they
can
only
loan
up
to
8%
of
their
assets
for
personal
expenditure
loans.
commercial
banks
are
not
restricted
in
this
way.
well,
i
could
go
on
but
it
boils
down
really
to
again
a
distinction
between
the
unique
capacity
of
commercial
banks
on
the
one
hand
and
the
--
particularly
in
serving
commercial
business
and
the
very
useful
and
important
competition
that
savings
banks
have
in
the
area
of
serving
the
family
and
the
individual
and
those
who
want
to
borrow
on
real
estate
or
for
real
estate
purposes.
now
there
is
another
important
development
in
connecticut
that
was
quite
significant
in
the
district
court’s
opinion.
the
state
of
connecticut
adopted
subsequent
to
the
trial
in
this
case
a
statute
permitting
savings
banks
to
enter
the
area
up
to
now
exclusively
the
preserve
of
the
commercial
banks,
the
demand
deposit.
connecticut
savings
banks
will
be
able,
after
1976,
though
still
not
in
effect
yet,
to
offer
personal
checking
accounts.
they
will
be
able
to
offer
these
only
to
individuals,
however,
and
only
for
personal
use,
not
for
business
purposes.
of
course,
demand
deposits
in
commercial
banks
are
not
so
limited.
moreover,
experience
elsewhere
has
indicated
that
checking
account
powers
held
by
savings
banks
does
not
mean
a
mass
exodus
from
commercial
banks
to
savings
banks
to
use
some
of
the
words
of
dr.
miles.
the
states
of
new
jersey
and
connecticut
both
permit
savings
banks
checking
accounts
and
they
also
permit
them
on
a
somewhat
broader
scale
in
connecticut
because
in
those
states
business
savings
accounts
are
allowed.
nonetheless,
looking
at
them
only
as
--
looking
at
checking
accounts
only
as
a
proportion
of
the
savings
banks
accounts
is
relative,
it’s
quite
low,
i
think
it’s
only
5
or
6%.
so
it’s
unlikely
that
the
competition,
while
it’s
important
and
useful
and
desirable
is
going
to
destroy
the
distinctive
nature
of
commercial
banking
in
connecticut.
now
we’ve
approached
this
case
from
the
standpoint
of
philadelphia
bank
in
phillipsburg
which
recognized
commercial
banking
as
a
distinctive
line
of
commerce.
we
did
not
argue
that
commercial
banking
is
a
line
of
commerce
as
a
matter
of
law.
we
had,
we
would
have
objected
to
the
introduction
of
evidence
on
this
issue.
we
did
contend
that
this
is
the
starting
place.
we
showed
that
commercial
banks
in
connecticut
are
just
like
the
commercial
banks
in
the
rest
of
the
country,
and
that
therefore,
there
is
a
sufficient
basis
to
treat
them
as
a
distinctive
line
of
commerce.
now,
once
we
were
past
the
line
of
commerce
problem
though,
we
had
to
consider
the
section
of
the
country.
we
approach
that
as
we
had,
most
other
banking
cases,
we
look
to
a
metropolitan
area
or
region
as
being
a
practical
compromise
between
very
large
customers
and
very
small
customer
banks
and
we
suggested
that
the
proper
measure
was
the
metropolitan
area
in
bridgeport
and
the
metropolitan
area
in
new
haven,
consisting
of
a
central
city,
the
cities
of
new
haven
and
bridgeport
respectively
and
the
surrounding
towns
and
we
used
a
general
measure,
the
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area
or
smsa
which
is
a
useful
device.
it
requires
that
there
would
be
a
central
city
of
not
less
than
50,000
population,
surrounding
towns
of
not
less
than
15,000
population,
not
more
than
15,000
population,
no
less.
and
that
there
be
a
commutation
on
a
significant
basis,
25%
out
from
the
town,
in
from
the
suburbs
into
the
town
and
15%
out
from
the
town
into
the
suburbs.
we
thought
this
was
a
practical
test
in
this
area
because
in
this
area,
metropolitan
areas
are
small.
we
are
not
dealing
with
great,
small
--
sprawling
agglomerates
as
in
washington
metropolitan
area
or
new
york
city
or
even
philadelphia.
it
was
relatively
small
close
end
area.
now
the
smsa
concept
is
not
ipso
facto
definition
of
a
banking
market.
it’s
just
a
tool,
but
we
thought
it
was
a
practical
one
and
so
we
used
that
as
our
test.
the
district
court
rejected
it
because
we
did
not
show
what
percentage
of
accounts
from
within
the
metropolitan
area,
actually
were
in
the
banks
in
that
metropolitan
area
and
the
reason
we
did
not
show
it
is
because
we
couldn’t
show
it.
the
only
way
you
can
get
that
kind
of
information
is
by
taking
a
full
scale
census
of
the
smsa
or
having
some
wondrous
computer
work
done
by
all
of
the
banks
involved
at
great
expense.
in
fact,
what
we
did
in
this
case,
the
difficulty
what’s
required
is
demonstrated
by
the
experience
that
the
defendants
had
with
the
new
york
banks.
defendants
argue
new
york
banks
are
a
factor
in
this
market
and
they
wanted
to
show
the
extent
to
which
accounts
from
connecticut.
people
in
connecticut
had
taken
their
business
to
the
new
york
banks.
so
they
asked
the
new
york
banks
for
statement
of
addresses
broken
down
in
various
ways
and
the
new
york
banks,
the
six
leading
banks
in
the
country
and
possibly
the
world,
the
most
modern
world,
simply
could
not
do
it
in
the
time
available
at
the
cost
involved
and
we
had
to
settle
for
less.
so
the
government,
what
it
did
do
is
prevail
upon
the
defendants
at
least
to
show
by
a
sampling
of
their
headquarters’
offices
and
some
of
the
surrounding
towns
just
what
percentage
of
the
business
arose
within
the
smsa
in
these
sample
offices
and
the
results
were
not
surprising,
about
80%
to
use
an
average
of
the
business
was
within
the
smsa.
now,
we
thought
therefore
that
we
had
proved
that
metropolitan
areas
are
a
proper
market.
the
district
court
rejected
this
and
said
that
the
only
market
is
the
state
at
large.
now
this
is
a
very
surprising
view
because
it
means
that
you
don’t
have
local
banking
markets
in
connecticut
for
any
practical
purpose,
you
just
have
a
great
big
thing
called
the
state
at
large.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
no,
your
honor.
the
size
of
the
state
while
it
is
a
factor,
well
just
doesn’t
mean
that
there
aren’t
local
banking
markets.
to
illustrate
the
defendants
in
this
case
contend
that
the
philadelphia
bank
standards
should
not
be
applied
to
them
because
on
a
statewide
basis.
they
say
the
state
is
the
market
but
philadelphia
bank
should
not
be
applied
to
them
because
they
aren’t
head
to
head
competitors.
they
are
not
competing
with
each
other.
so
they
are
really
kind
of
denying
the
existence
of
a
statewide
market
in
any
traditional
sense
and
that
sense
of
course
is
that
it'd
be
a
practical
compromise
based
on
the
customer-supplier
relationship
which
measures
an
area
of
effective
competition
among
banks.
now,
the
hartford
banks
in
hartford
do
not
compete
with
the
defendants
in
new
haven.
the
hartford
banks,
when
they
have
an
office
in
new
haven
do
compete
with
the
defendant
banks
in
new
haven
so
it
is
a
local
market
that
we
are
talking
about,
not
a
statewide.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
certainly
rhode
island
(voice
overlap).
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
rhode
island
would
come
close
although
even
there
in
the
southern
part
of
the
state
or
out
on
the
island
that
is
off
the
coast
that
might
be
possible
to
say
that
is
distinct
but
well,
hartford
is
42
miles
away
or
50
miles
away
by
car
i
think
from
new
haven
and
that’s
a
littler
far
to
go
banking.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
and
it
sprawls,
there
are
11
metropolitan
areas
in
the
state
and
they
are
fairly
distinctive,
we
contend.
now
there
is
the
matter
of
the
new
york
banks.
new
york
banks
cast
a
long
shadow
in
the
banking
in
our
country.
in
fact
they
cast
a
shadow
not
only
over
connecticut
but
over
in
new
england
and
the
middle
atlantic
states
in
the
country
at
large.
they
are
big
banks
and
they
are
doing
the
business
on
a
national
basis.
it’s
also
true
that
connecticut,
in
its
very
southwest
corner,
there
is
a
little
panhandle
that
sticks
out
of
southwestern
connecticut,
kind
of,
into
new
york
and
that
is
a
commuter
area.
it
probably
runs
up
a
little
beyond
stanford
and
people
who
live
in
that
area
can
get
into
new
york
city
to
work
and
do
get
into
new
york
city
to
work
and
there
are
substantial,
there
are
undoubtedly
commuter
accounts
in
the
new
york
banks
and
a
fairly
reasonable
number
of
them,
a
fairly
high
number
them.
but
when
the
defendants
brought
in
a
report
through
special
masters
appointed
by
the
district
court
on
the
effect
to
the
new
york
banks,
what
they
found
was
that
there
are
about
$487
million
in
so
called
connecticut
accounts
and
that’s
accounts
from
the
state
as
a
whole
which
were
in
the
new
york
banks,
that
is
roughly
7%
of
the
total
deposits
in
connecticut
commercial
banks,
divided
among
the
six
biggest
new
york
banks
and
then
when
we
looked
a
little
closer
at
it
we
found
this.
the
average
size
of
those
deposits
was
$20,000.00.
now
the
average
size
of
connecticut
bank
deposit
was
$1,700.00.
this
is
in
government
exhibit
130.
now,
what
this
suggests
is
that
the
new
york
banks
are
really
competing
for
the
larger
business
accounts,
that
is
where
the
bulk
of
the
big
account
is
coming
from,
that
is
where
the
bulk
of
that
money
is
coming
from.
now,
new
york
banks
compete
across
the
country,
this
was
recognized
in
philadelphia.
in
philadelphia,
the
court
excluded
the
new
york
banks
from
the
market,
saying
it
would
draw
the
market
to
a
broad
and
it
also,
despite
the
geographic
proximity,
excluded
other
states
in
the
philadelphia
area,
i
think
pennsylvania
and
delaware
and
i
think
the
same
rule
would
apply
here.
so
under
a
philadelphia
test
and
the
facts
we
show,
we
don’t
think
that
the
new
york
banks
are
the
fact
that
the
defendants
make
them.
now,
we
did
agree
that
the
state
is
a
section
of
the
country,
not
a
banking
market
in
a
traditional
buyer
seller
sense,
but
a
section
of
the
country
in
which
certain
distinctive
competitive
effects
could
be
measured
and
we
argue
that
philadelphia
bank
would
necessarily
apply.
it
applies
because
there
is
a
competitive
danger
when
these
big
banks
are
merging,
that
you
are
going
to
get
a
statewide
oligopoly.
the
defendants
deny
that.
they
say
philadelphia
shouldn’t
apply
but
they
do
not
really
explain
why,
if
the
state
as
a
market
as
they
contend,
it
shouldn’t,
except
that
they
say
we
are
not
head
to
head
competitors.
well
there
are
other
competitive
effects
besides
head
to
head.
i
turn
now
to
the
problem
of
entry
which
is
an
important
consideration
here.
i
think
the
first
important
thing
to
remember
about
entry
in
these
cases
is
that
when
a
merger
is
denied,
a
bank
will
seek
an
alternative
way
of
getting
into
a
market
which
it
says
it
can’t
get
into.
now
that’s
demonstrated
dramatically
in
this
case.
connecticut
national
attempted
to
merge
with
one
of
the
big
hartford
banks.
the
department
of
justice
sued
and
they
abandoned
the
merger.
they
told
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
in
government
exhibit
125,
in
their
application
that
there
was
no
way
that
hartford
bank
could
get
into
the
bridgeport
market,
except
by
merging
with
connecticut
national
bank
and
then
when
the
merger
was
frustrated,
the
hartford
bank
went
in
and
bought
a
little
bank
in
bridgeport
made
of
foothold
entry
into
bridgeport
city
itself
and
then
made
a
de
novo
branch
entry
into
the
city
of
fair
--
in
the
town
of
fairfield
which
was
then
an
open
town.
so
that
this
problem
of
seeking
alternatives
is
demonstrated
by
this
record
in
g.
ex.
125.
now,
there
are
three
ways
we
think
that
people
could
enter
in
connecticut.
first,
i
have
to
explain
that
under
connecticut
law,
there
is
a
home
office
protection
provision
which
says
that
a
bank
cannot
enter
another
bank’s
headquarters’
town
so
that
any
town
that
has
a
bank
headquartered
in
it
is
closed
to
de
novo
branching.
i
shouldn’t
say
can’t
enter,
i
should
say
de
novo
branching.
it
is
close
to
the
opening
of
a
new
branch
office
but
there
were
towns
around
new
haven,
there
were
towns
around
bridgeport
which
were
open
for
de
novo
entry
and
we
contend
that
if
you
view
the
area
as
a
metropolitan
area,
you
could
make
effective
entry
into
those
towns
and
be
an
effective
functioning
competitor
in
the
metropolitan
area.
a
second
method
for
entry
was
by
purchasing
a
foothold
bank.
there
are
no
foothold
banks
left
in
new
haven
because
the
hartford
banks
picked
them
up
two
years
ago,
but
there
are
foothold
banks
in
the
surrounding
towns
and
they
did
offer
a
means
of
entry.
now
the
same
thing
was
true
around
bridgeport.
what’s
happened
in
bridgeport
is
that
there
were
six
towns
open
for
entry,
five
towns
open
for
--
six
towns
open
for
entry
and
there
has
now
been
new
banks
created
in
those
towns,
fairfield,
trumbull,
some
of
the
others
and
the
result
is
that
those
towns
are
now
closed
to
de
novo
branching
because
they’ll
be
a
bank
headquartered
in
them.
but
those
new
little
banks
form
potential
foothold
entrants
so
there
is
a
way
of
getting
in
by
that
method.
finally,
there
is
the
use
of
the
holding
company
which
is
authorized
under
connecticut
law.
connecticut
does
permit
the
holding
companies.
there
is
no
reason
why
a
holding
company
could
not
sponsor.
i
shouldn’t
say
sponsor,
actually
create
a
subsidiary
and
acquire
it.
it
was
argued
that
this
might
be
illegal
but
the
comptroller.
i
am
sorry,
the
commissioner
of
banking
in
connecticut
testified
that
he
had
never
been
faced
with
this
kind
of
request
before.
the
bank
holding
company
law
in
connecticut
has
only
been
in
effect
since
1969.
in
fact,
there
were
a
couple
of
young
vice
presidents
in
the
first
new
haven
bank
who
suggested
this
route
in
1969
but
at
that
time,
first
new
haven
was
looking
around
for
a
merger
partner
and
they
were
not
about
to
be
listened
to
and
of
course
connecticut
national
was
also
engaged
in
looking
for
a
partner
among
the
top
ten
so
no
one
was
going
to
pursue
these
routes.
finally,
i
would
like
to
say
one
brief
word
about
the
convenience
and
needs
defense
in
this
case.
that
defense
was
that
there
would
be
special
banking
services
of
a
kind
which
would
serve,
particularly
in
the
interest
of
business
but
perhaps
the
shortest
and
quickest
answer
to
the
convenience
and
needs
defense
here
is
that
the
bank
examiner
who
went
out
when
the
application
for
these
banks
was
submitted,
when
the
merger
application
was
submitted.
the
bank
examiner
who
went
out
came
back
and
said
both
of
these
banks
are
adequately
serving
the
convenience
and
needs
of
their
community,
and
they
are,
they
are
good
banks
and
the
community
is
well-banked.
there
is
plenty
of
alternative
service
in
the
bridgeport
metropolitan
area
and
the
other,
and
the
final
point
on
that
issue
is
that
if
you
are
going
to
engage
in
a
balancing
of
competitive
effects
against
convenience
and
need,
you
have
got
to
be
right
about
the
competitive
effects.
our
overall
position
is
that
the
district
court
here
was
wrong
on
the
line
of
commerce,
was
wrong
on
the
section
of
the
country,
was
wrong
on
the
condition
of
entry,
failed
to
give
--
failed
to
weigh
adequately
competitive
effects
and
therefore
couldn’t
adequately
measure
convenience
and
needs.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
thank
you,
your
honor.
first
i
would
like
to
address
the
question
of
markets.
dr.
peck
who's
study
of
potential
entrants
was
referred
to
by
mr.
reycraft
conceded
that
his
study
did
not
undertake
a
study
of
banking
markets.
he
simply
looked
at
towns
as
geographic
entities.
he
also
stated
that
he
did
not
consider
the
question
of
the
effect
of
actual
entry.
he
was
simply
looking
at
the
potential
entrants
from
the
standpoint
of
the
so-called
perceived
effect
and
finally
he
said
at
the
close
of
his
cross-examination
that
he
wasn't
all
concerned
with
concentration,
he
considered
it
unimportant
in
banking.
so,
that
i
don’t
think
that
dr.
peck’s
studies
really
focused
on
the
market
question
that
he
should
have
focused
on
in
trying
to
determine
who
is
the
potential
entrant.
now
who
is
the
potential
entrant?
the
government’s
theory
was
that
the
most
significant
potential
entrants
were
in
the
top
10
banks
in
the
state.
of
those
top
10
banks,
two
of
them,
the
big
bridgeport
banks
we
said
were
already
in
the
bridgeport
in
new
haven
areas.
mr.
howard
e.
shapiro
the
big
hartford
banks.
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
hartford
national
is
actually
in
--
hartford
national
is
not
in
bridgeport,
but
it
is
in
fairfield.
so
we
say
it
is
already
in
the
metropolitan
area
and
of
course
the
other
bank
is
in
both
new
haven
and
fairfield.
now,
eliminating
the
top
two,
that
leaves
eight
and
if
you
eliminate
the
banks
that
are
not
in
new
haven
or
bridgeport,
you
get
a
very
small
number
left
and
of
those
we
then
look
to
see
who
was
large
and
close
by.
and
the
most
obvious
entrants
were
the
bridgeport
bank
moving
over
to
new
haven
and
the
new
haven
bank
moving
over
to
bridgeport
and
we
said
they
are
the
most
significant
entrants.
now,
mr.
reycraft
suggested
that
the
test
should
be
whether
the
banks
would
have
entered,
but
for
the
merger,
but
we
suggest
that
that
test
would
be
a
test
of
certainty
which
would
not
fit
the
purposes
of
section
7.
the
real
test
is
whether
--
a
test
which
would
fit
the
purposes
of
section
7,
is
whether
if
the
merger
route
is
closed,
it
is
probable
that
the
banks
would
enter
given
their
incentive
and
capacity.
and
this
is
we
think
we
demonstrated
that
they
had
the
incentive
and
that
they
had
the
capacity
that
means
of
entry
did
exist
if
they
were
encouraged
to
do
it
and
we
think
this
was
demonstrated
by
the
experience
of
the
connecticut
national
attempt
to
merge
with
the
big
hartford
bank.
the
hartford
bank
which
said
it
could
not
get
in
to
bridgeport
did
try
to
get
into
bridgeport
and
did
succeed
in
doing
so.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
in
addition
to
offering
to
divest
themselves
of
the
banks
which
were
the
subject
of
actual
competition
in
the
four-town
area.
the
defendants
at
pages
40
and
41
of
the
record
also
said
that
if
they
were
allowed
to
merge,
they
would
get
themselves
in
the
hartford.
they
said
it
would
be
difficult
legally,
but
they
would
attempt
to
find
the
way,
again
proving
that
if
the
merger
route
is
closed,
people
will
seek
an
alternative.
now,
counsel
for
the
comptroller
has
set
forth
what
he
views
as
a
difference
between
the
department
of
justice
and
his
agency
over
banking
policy.
we
suggest
that
it
is
not
a
question
of
banking
policy.
it
is
a
question
of
whether
the
bank
merger
act
of
1966
which
makes
section
7
controlling
is
going
to
be
controlling
as
congress
intended.
in
the
comptroller’s
brief
at
page
54
there
is
a
note
23
which
says
that
he
favors
merger
over
entry
by
de
novo
methods
or
by
new
charters.
he
has
an
affirmative
policy
in
favor
of
merger.
now,
the
department
of
justice
believing
that
section
7
is
controlling
here
feels
that
the
test
is
not
whether
there
is
going
to
be
simply
local
oligopolies
immune
from
competition
by
expanding
banks.
we
favor
the
expansion
of
the
statewide
bank.
we
favor
its
entry
into
local
markets
that
is
our
policy,
but
the
question
is
how
it
gets
in.
if
it
goes
in
on
a
small
basis
and
has
to
fight
in
that
local
market
it's
going
to
upset
the
status
quo.
it’s
going
to
bring
the
benefits
of
competition
to
that
market.
if
it
walks
in
by
buying
a
large
share
it’s
going
to
settle
down
and
we
are
going
to
have
in
the
local
market
the
same
kind
of
oligopoly
we
had
before.
we
encourage
de
novo
entry,
we
encourage
foothold
merger.
that
is
why
we
have
not
challenged
the
expansions
by
the
big
hartford
banks
because
they
always
were
careful
to
stay
on
a
small
scale
when
they
went
into
new
markets
and
to
the
extent
that
has
happened
in
connecticut,
we
have
had
an
increase
in
local
diversity
which
we
favor,
but
the
question
is
always
how
the
expansion
is
achieved?
now,
the
comptroller
mentioned
the
washington
area
as
an
example
of
how
market
should
be
defined.
well,
i
suggest
that
the
washington
area
is
a
good
analogy
for
considering
a
metropolitan
area
as
a
banking
market.
in
this
sense,
the
suburban
banks
in
washington
cannot
get
into
the
central
city.
the
central
city
banks
cannot
get
into
the
suburbs
and
yet
there
is
genuine
competition
among
those
banks.
thank
you,
your
honor.
