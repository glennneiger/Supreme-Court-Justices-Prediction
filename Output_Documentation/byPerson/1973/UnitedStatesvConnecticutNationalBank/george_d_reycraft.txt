mr.
george
d.
reycraft
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
decided
against
the
government
after
a
trial
in
which
the
district
court
heard
testimony
from
24
witnesses
whose
testimony
covered
more
than
2500
pages
and
after
the
district
court
reviewed
more
than
240
exhibits,
approximately
seven
months
after
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
the
district
court
made
293
findings
of
fact
and
taken
apart
from
proposed
findings
submitted
by
the
government
and
part
from
those
submitted
from
the
defendants.
this
lengthy
record
covered
in
detail
as
required
by
branch
to
the
history,
structure
and
probable
future
of
banking
in
connecticut.
the
government
called
only
three
witnesses
in
this
case
in
chief.
the
first
witness
was
dr.
glans
who
testified
only
as
to
how
standard
metropolitan
statistical
areas
are
delineated.
he
was
not
offered
as
expert
in
banking
markets.
in
effect,
he
disclaimed
any
expertise
in
banking
markets.
he
agreed
that
smsa’s
are
determined
strictly
on
commuting
patterns
and
that
banking
is
not
one
of
the
criteria
used
in
determining
an
smsa.
he
said
that
cities
and
towns
in
the
new
england
area
are
much
more
meaningful
ways
of
analyzing
smsa’s
and
building
smsa’s
than
counties
as
in
other
parts
of
the
country
because
of
the
relatively
large
size
of
counties
in
connecticut.
he
testified
that
new
haven
and
bridgeport
were
two
separate
and
distinct
areas,
that
there
was
very
little,
if
any
cross
commuting
and
very
little,
if
any,
economic
integration
between
the
two.
he
said
that
the
city
of
--
the
population
of
the
city
of
new
haven
had
declined
by
about
20%
during
the
20-year
period
from
1950s
and
1970
and
that
the
population
of
the
city
of
bridgeport
declined
by
1.4%
during
the
same
period.
the
second
witness
called
by
the
government
was
dr.
neil
b.
murphy,
a
former
staff
member
of
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
who
had
worked
on
bank
mergers
there.
dr.
murphy
did
say
the
commercial
banks
were
unique
financial
institutions,
but
he
relied
primarily
on
the
demand
deposit
function
which
he
says
virtually
unique
to
commercial
banking.
he
said
its
the
most
important
service
offered
by
commercial
bank
which
is
not
authored
by
savings
banks.
now,
its
an
undisputed
fact
as
mr.
shapiro
had
said
that
savings
banks
in
the
state
of
connecticut
do
now
have
the
power,
effective
january
1,
1976,
to
offer
checking
accounts
and
accept
demand
deposits
in
the
state
of
connecticut,
thereby
eliminating
that
most
important
distinction.
he
generally
agreed
with
the
government,
that
as
dr.
murphy
that
smsa’s
at
the
outset
were
at
least
a
useful
starting
point
for
determining
banking
markets.
but
he
agreed
also,
dr.
murphy
that
they
were
not
used
to
analyze
banking
markets.
dr.
murphy
himself,
the
government’s
expert
said
in
an
article
he
wrote
that
increase
in
competition
among
commercial
banks
and
savings
type
institutions
or
savings
type
liabilities
suggest
to
some
reconsideration
of
the
product
line
may
be
an
order
and
he
said
this
is
especially
important
if
savings
banks
are
successful
in
obtaining
the
checking
account
privilege
which
they
now
have
in
connecticut
as
of
year-end
1975.
he
agreed
that
savings
banks
are
reasonable
substitutes
for
commercial
banks
in
connecticut
for
personal
loans.
he
agreed
that
savings
banks
in
fact
now
treat
savings
deposits
as
it
withdrawable
on
demand
even
though
they
do
have
the
right
to
ask
for
a
30-day
notice
before
allowing
withdrawal.
dr.
murphy,
the
government’s
expert
agreed
that
79%
of
connecticut
national’s
loan
portfolio
now
is
subject
to
competition
from
savings
banks.
he
agreed
that
a
commercial
banker,
considering
a
new
market
should
take
into
consideration
the
presence
of
savings
banks.
he
agreed
that
the
fact
of
the
population
of
new
haven
had
declined
about
20%
from
1950
to
1970
meant
that
it
was
not
a
very
good
place
to
put
a
new
bank
office
as
far
as
retail
business
is
concerned,
and
he
said
that
they
found
objective
evidence
he
would
not
put
a
bank
there.
he
agreed
that
banking
in
connecticut
has
become
more
competitive
between
1955
and
1971
because
of
more
alternatives
available
to
consumers.
he
agreed
that
the
proposed
merger
will
have
no
adverse
effect
at
the
present
time
on
small
borrowers,
small
depositors
or
small
businessmen
in
either
new
haven
or
bridgeport.
the
third
witness
called
by
the
government
was
mr.
benjamin
blackford
who
is
president
of
state
national
bank
in
bridgeport,
a
competitor
of
connecticut
national
bank.
state
national
bank
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
s&h
green
stamps
combined
connecticut
state
national
and
s&h
green
stamps
have
assets
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
billion
dollars
and
earnings
in
a
neighborhood
of
$30
million
a
year
compared
to
$3.75
million
for
connecticut
national
bank.
mr.
blackford
testified,
if
he
was
not
familiar
with
the
phrase
standard
metropolitan
area
and
he
did
not
know
what
made
it
up
or
what
it
meant.
he
also
testified
that
state
national
was
a
one
price
bank,
that
is
it
does
not
charge
discriminatory
prices
and
charge
the
same
throughout
its
service
area.
he
said
that
state
national
is
in
competition
with
savings
banks
with
one
hand
tied
behind
our
back.
he
said
that
every
bank
in
the
area
he
feels
they
compete
with
new
york
banks
for
trust
business.
he
said
state
national
has
a
lot
of
customers
who
work
in
new
york.
he
said
a
few
of
these
big
mutual
savings
bank
around
here
gives
us
all
the
competition
we
need,
and
he
said
he
takes
into
account
savings
bank
competition
when
he
considers
opening
a
new
branch
because
as
he
said,
“if
you
can’t
beat
them
on
price,
you
got
to
beat
on
service.”
mr.
blackford
was
a
concluding
witness
in
the
government’s
case
in
chief.
the
government
called
only
one
other
witness.
that
was
mr.
peter
stass,
the
president
of
lafayette
bank
and
trust
company
who
is
called
in
rebuttal.
mr.
stass
also
said
that
he
did
not
consider
the
smsa
concept
one
way
or
the
other
as
being
the
market
of
lafayette.
he
testified,
“i
think
we
have
our
own
description
of
what
our
market
is”
and
he
said
that
the
bank’s
market
was
primarily
where
it
had
its
offices.
he
testified
also
that
competition
--
that
his
competition
included
every
other
bank
and
he
specifically
include
savings
banks
within
that
competition.
the
defendants
and
intervenor
called
20
witnesses,
including
two
economists,
one
dr.
burton
j.
peck,
the
chairman
of
the
economics
department
of
yale
university
and
the
other
dr.
charles
dopes,
the
former
chairman
of
the
economics
department
of
university
of
bridgeport.
both
of
these
witnesses
who
detailed
familiarity
with
the
market
and
the
area,
geographic
area
in
connecticut
and
both
of
whom
are
experts
in
structural
competition
and
potential
competition
testified
that
as
economist,
they
saw
no
adverse
effect
on
the
structure
of
potential
competition
or
any
of
its
parts
on
the
proposed
merger.
dr.
peck
took
the
government’s
assumptions
on
the
significance
of
potential
competition
and
he
applied
them
to
connecticut.
he
assumed
that
commercial
banking
was
a
line
of
commerce.
he
assumed
that
entry
into
the
close
towns
of
new
haven
and
bridgeport
might
occur
sometime
in
the
future
and
he
assumed
that
potential
competition
has
some
significance
in
the
field
of
banking.
he
prepared
a
detailed
study
of
the
structure
of
potential
competition
in
connecticut
based
on
these
three
assumptions
of
the
government
and
concluded
that
even
on
these
assumptions
the
proposed
merger
will
have
no
adverse
effect
on
the
structure
of
potential
competition
in
connecticut.
he
found
that
following
a
proposed
merger
that
would
be
no
less
than
four
firms
identified
by
the
government
as
potential
entrants
in
each
for
the
major
banking
markets
in
connecticut.
the
district
court
found
based
on
dr.
peck’s
testimony
that
no
first
rank
potential
entrant
would
be
eliminated
by
the
merger
and
then
the
21
of
40
closed
towns,
there
are
now
48
closed
towns
of
169
that
theoretically
eliminated
potential
entrant
ranked
seven
out
of
ten.
the
court
also
based
on
dr.peck’s
testimony
that
in
52
open
towns,
nine
potential
entrants
identified
by
the
government
as
having
statewide
expansion
capability
would
remain
after
consolidation.
in
15
large
towns
in
connecticut
with
over
50,000
in
population,
dr.
peck
testified
and
the
district
court
found
that
there
are
no
fewer
than
four
banks
identified
by
the
plaintiff
as
capable
of
expanding
in
the
statewide
systems
which
would
remain
as
potential
entrants
after
the
proposed
consolidation.
for
example
in
hartford,
first
new
haven
ranks
fifth
in
size
among
the
ten
largest
theoretical
potential
commercial
bank
entrants.
at
the
present
time,
first
new
haven
would
rank
no
better
than
fourth
among
theoretical
potential
entrants
into
bridgeport.
now,
mr.
shapiro
has
said
first
new
haven
is
the
most
likely
entrant
into
bridgeport.
i
simply
don’t
understand
that.
hartford
national
which
has
$1.7
billion
of
assets
is
not
now
in
the
city
of
bridgeport
and
on
the
government’s
theory
that
is
the
mostly
likely
entrant
into
bridgeport.
under
the
government’s
theory,
the
second
most
likely
entrant
into
the
city
of
bridgeport
is
union
trust
company
with
over
$700
million
of
assets.
it
is
not
now
in
bridgeport.
under
the
government’s
theory
is
the
third
largest
potential
entrant
into
bridgeport
is
colonial
bank
and
trust
company
of
waterbury
which
is
larger
than
first
new
haven.
the
district
court
found
based
on
dr.
peck’s
testimony
before
the
merger,
there
are
five
potential
entrants
into
new
haven
ranked
by
the
government
as
capable
of
becoming
statewide
banks.
after
the
consolidation
there
would
be
four.
the
district
court
found
that
since
five
of
connecticut’s
largest
commercial
banks
already
operate
in
new
haven,
they
have
more
impact
on
competition
there
than
there
is
possibility
of
potential
entry
by
connecticut
national.
the
five
banks
in
new
haven
now
are
connecticut
bank
and
trust
company
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
mr.
justice
white,
the
government
offered
no
evidence
on
perceived
potential
entry.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
understand
mr.
justice
white
that
in
analyzing
either
of
these
concepts,
the
government
does
look
at
who
is
the
most
likely
and
then
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
deny
that
connecticut
national
is
national
potential
entrant
into
new
haven.
the
discussion
of
potential
competition
in
the
state
of
connecticut
was
based
on
the
government’s
assumptions,
namely
that
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
think
the
most
important
thing
that
the
government
is
to
show
mr.
justice
white
is
that
the
potential
entrant,
the
claimed
potential
entrant
would
have
entered
the
town,
but
for
the
acquisition.
i
say
of
course
that
the
government
did
not
prove
that.
new
haven
is
a
closed
town
and
connecticut
national
could
not
enter
new
haven.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
well,
i
would
think
so
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
would
think
so
because
if
the
most
likely
entrant
is
the
one
who
is
most
likely
--
i
do
not
know
what’s
to
add
to
that,
and
the
question
is,
what
is
the
importance
of
eliminating
a
less
likely
entrant
if
the
fourth
most
likely
entrant
is
being
eliminated
theoretically
then
there
are
three
left
who
are
more
likely.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
if
the
government
had
proved
that
connecticut
national
would
have
entered
the
city
of
new
haven
by
other
means
then
they
would
have
advanced
their
cause.
i
agree
with
you
they
did
not
prevail.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
well,
i
think
that
it
is
a
question
of
fact
as
to
whether
they
would
have
entered
and
in
my
conception
of
the
evidence
in
this
case,
the
government
didn’t
make
a
serious
attempt
even
to
prove
that
they
would
have
entered.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
well,
on
objective
facts
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
say
that
the
objective
facts
as
to
likelihood
of
entry
would
be
based
upon
the
size
of
the
potential
entrant
and
that
the
larger
the
entry
the
more
likely
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
if
the
government
is
correct
that
new
haven
banks
can
enter
the
city
of
bridgeport
and
if
first
new
haven
was
eliminated
as
one
of
the
less
firms
which
would
have,
but
did
not
then
the
reserve
question,
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
say
that
would
--
the
government
would
argue
so
that
was
a
loss
of
competitor
in
that
area.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
[laughter
attempt]
i
would
agree
that
six
competitors
generally
mean
more
competition
than
five.
it’s
a
question
of
substantiality
however,
whether
the
likelihood
of
that,
elimination
of
that
possibility
would
substantially
lessen
competition
and
that
is
what
i
say
the
government
has
failed
to
prove.
professor
stokes,
who
is
on
leave
from
the
university
of
bridgeport,
also
testified
that
the
proposed
merger
would
have
no
effect
on
the
structure
of
potential
competition
in
connecticut.
the
defendants
and
the
intervenor
called
18
other
witnesses
who
were
bankers
and
businessmen
from
the
city
of
new
haven
who
testified
generally
on
competition
and
generally
agreed
that
commercial
banks
and
savings
banks
were
in
very
substantial
competition
within
the
state.
the
structure
of
bank
in
connecticut
is
highly
competitive.
the
number
of
commercial
banks
has
increased
during
the
last
11
years
and
the
alternatives
available
to
consumers
has
increased
in
majority
of
connecticut’s
169
towns.
as
of
year
end
1963,
there
were
64
commercial
banks
in
connecticut,
as
of
the
close
of
the
record
there
were
also
64
commercial
banks
in
connecticut.
since
the
close
of
the
record
as
mr.
shapiro
has
indicated
eight
new
commercial
banks
have
been
chartered,
so
there
are
now
72
commercial
banks
in
connecticut
compared
to
64
twelve
years
ago.
so
that
this
alone
demonstrates
that
the
most
likely
entrance
in
the
commercial
banking
in
the
city
--
in
the
state
of
connecticut
are
investors
and
not
other
banks.
there
has
been
no
occasion
in
the
history
of
banking
in
connecticut
when
any
bank
holding
companies
or
bank
has
followed
the
route
proposed
by
mr.
shapiro
which
is
to
the
so
called
holding
company
new
charter
route.
the
state
commissioner
of
banking
testified
that
it
had
never
happened
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
he
said
that
if
it
were
done,
it
would
result
in
a
beguile
call
of
fury
from
other
banks
with
litigation.
the
state
of
connecticut
also
has
a
form
which
applicants
for
a
new
bank
charter
are
required
to
fill
out.
that
form
says
this
bank
is
not
be
to
organized
for
the
purpose
of
selling,
merging
or
combining
with
any
state
bank
or
trust
company
or
national
bank
now
in
existence.
so
in
order
to
file
a
procedure
that
the
government
is
suggesting
in
this
case,
it
would
require
full
statements
by
the
applicants
in
order
to
get
a
state
bank
charter.
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
has
only
charted
three
banks
in
the
state
of
connecticut
since
1963
and
two
of
these
banks
were
what
are
called
interim
banks
which
were
formed
for
the
purpose
of
facilitating
the
elimination
of
minority
shareholders
in
a
bank
holding
company
in
hartford.
for
the
state
as
a
whole,
commercial
banking
options
for
retail
customers
have
in
increased
in
94
of
the
169
connecticut
towns
and
they
have
decreased
in
only
three
towns
between
1955
and
1971.
there
are
more
alternatives
today
in
fairfield
county
in
19
of
23
fairfield
county
towns
than
they
were
in
1955
and
a
more
alternatives
in
22
of
27
new
haven
county
towns
than
1955.
among
the
119
towns
in
connecticut
outside
fairfield
and
new
haven
counties,
the
number
of
commercial
banking
options
has
increased
in
53,
remains
unchanged
in
65
and
decreased
in
only
one
such
town.
even
dr.
murphy,
the
government’s
expert
witness
conceded
that
banking
in
connecticut
has
become
more
competitive
since
1955.
the
government
has
raised
essentially
four
issues
here,
whether
the
two
banks
are
significant
potential
entrants
into
each
others
markets,
whether
standard
metropolitan
statistical
areas
are
really
without
more
banking
markets,
whether
the
two
banks
are
significant
potential
entrants
into
other
local
banking
areas
in
connecticut,
and
fourth
whether
existing
competition
from
savings
banks
and
existing
competition
from
new
york
bank
should
be
totally
disregarded
in
determining
the
impact
on
the
structure
of
potential
competition
in
connecticut.
now,
the
district
court
found
against
the
government
on
all
of
this
issues
which
are
essentially
factual,
which
are
factual
issues.
the
government’s
argument
on
standard
metropolitan
statistical
areas
apparently
was
important
to
it
in
this
case
unlike
its
position
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case,
philipsburg,
brown
shoe
and
nashville
because
it
could
not
show
that
these
banks
were
likely
entrants
into
the
home
office
cities
of
the
others
because
they
were
closed.
in
order
to
show
an
entry
into
a
banking
market,
it
was
necessary
to
show
that
entry
into
a
suburban
town
somewhere
near
new
haven
would
be
adequate.
the
only
witness
who
testified
that
smsas
where
banking
markets
was
dr.
murphy
who
did
testify
he
had
the
no
familiarity
with
geography
of
the
banking
in
connecticut.
dr.
peck
who
was
familiar
with
the
area
who
teaches
at
yale
university
said
that
the
acquisition
of
for
example
a
small
bank
in
woodridge,
connecticut
would
not
be
ineffective
entry
into
the
new
haven
area
and
to
compete
with
first
new
haven
national
bank.
the
woodridge
bank
and
trust
company
has
about
$8
million
assets.
it
has
about
one
office.
it
is
not
allowed
to
branch
into
new
haven
because
that’s
a
closed
town
of
the
eleven
towns
in
the
new
haven
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area,
six
are
closed.
in
the
bridgeport
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area,
six
out
of
eight
of
the
towns
are
closed,
so
that
new
entry
into
those
towns
is
not
legally
permissible
at
the
present
time.
on
the
question
of
banking
markets,
both
the
government
and
the
defendants
in
this
case
agree
that
the
state
of
connecticut
is
appropriate
area
to
look
at
in
appraising
this
particular
bank
merger.
the
reason
is
because
as
defendants,
we
apply
this
court’s
test
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case
which
is
at
the
relevant
section
of
the
country
to
look
at
as
a
area
within
which
state
law
permits
banks
to
branch
or
merge
and
that’s
subject
to
home
office
protection
is
the
state
of
connecticut.
now,
we
don’t
say
that
the
state
of
connecticut
is
a
banking
market
in
which
first
new
haven
and
connecticut
national
compete
as
mr.
shapiro
does.
he
goes
from
the
assumption
that
if
connecticut
is
banking
market
therefore
everybody
in
the
state
must
compete
within
it.
the
facts
are
and
he
concedes
the
facts
are
that
they
do
not.
connecticut
national’s
primary
service
area
is
fairfield
county
where
most
of
its
offices
are
located.
first
new
havens
banking
area
is
essentially
southern
new
haven
county
and
there
is
a
small
area
of
interaction
between
them
and
the
four
town
area
that
mr.
shapiro
described,
but
other
than
that
they
are
not
in
competition
with
each
other.
there
are
smaller
banks
in
the
state
which
do
operate
strictly
on
a
local
basis.
for
example,
woodridge
bank
and
trust
company
that
we
have
referred
to
operates
strictly
in
woodridge.
the
government's
own
exhibit
show
that
in
the
town
of
fairfield,
connecticut
national’s
fairfield
office
gets
only
77.1%
of
its
business
from
writ
--
people
who
has
statement
addresses
in
the
town
of
fairfield
and
is
highly
localized.
they
show
that
83.1%
of
the
deposits
of
connecticut
national
trumbull
office
originate
in
trumbull.
so
for
the
small
customer,
he
is
limited
to
the
area
in
which
he
lives.
for
the
larger
customers,
however,
the
choice
has
increased
dramatically.
new
york
banks
as
much
as
shapiro
has
conceded
obtained
close
to
$500
million
of
banking
business
from
the
state
of
connecticut.
now
that's
just
banking
business
that
we
are
able
to
prove
as
a
result
of
a
survey
done
with
the
assistance
of
a
special
master.
we
served
deposition
notices
and
subpoenas
on
new
york
banks
and
while
we
encountered
a
good
deal
of
resistance
and
it
took
a
good
deal
of
time,
we
were
able
to
prove
nearly
$500
million
of
banking
businesses
which
these
banks
alone
get
out
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
this
is
significant
for
commuters
also
between
new
haven
and
--
between
connecticut
and
new
york,
the
choices
are
substantial.
the
government’s
own
exhibit
showed
that
there
are
50,000
people
who
cross
commute
between
connecticut
and
new
york.
about
25,000
go
from
connecticut
to
new
york
and
about
25,000
come
back
from
new
york
to
work
in
connecticut.
there
is
substantial
cross
commutation
and
the
government’s
evidence
shows
that
it’s
increasing.
now,
if
these
commuters
or
these
cross
commuters
represented
only
one
employed
person
per
household
of
five,
that
would
be
the
equivalent
of
the
city
of
250,000
people
which
is
larger
either
the
city
of
new
haven
or
the
city
of
bridgeport.
in
fairfield
county,
the
combined
circulation
of
the
new
york
times
and
the
new
york
daily
news
exceeds
by
six
to
one
the
circulation
of
the
only
local
newspaper
circulated
in
bridgeport
which
is
the
bridgeport
post
telegram.
television
advertisement
by
new
york
banks
saturates
the
lower
connecticut
area.
the
new
york
banks
do
advertise
of
personal
loans,
retail
loans,
savings
deposits.
now,
we
say
for
this
reason
that
the
government’s
statistics,
their
so
called
concentration
ratios
are
highly
suspect
or
highly
attenuated
not
only
for
the
reason
of
the
effect
that
new
york
banks
have
on
connecticut,
but
also
because
of
savings
bank
competition.
if
a
banker
in
new
haven
were
considering
entering
the
city
of
bridgeport,
he
would
have
to
consider
the
fact
that
when
he
went
into
bridgeport,
he
would
be
competing
with
connecticut
bank
and
trust
company
with
1.8
billion
of
assets,
hartford
national
with
1.7
billion
of
assets.
with
connecticut
national,
he
would
be
competing
with
people’s
savings
banks
with
over
700
million
of
assets
and
the
government’s
own
evidence
shows
that
over
70%
of
this
business
is
in
competition
with
savings
banks.
so,
whether
the
court
decides
that
savings
banks
should
be
included
in
the
line
of
commerce
or
analyze
it
strictly
in
commercial
banking
terms,
the
effect
of
that
competition
from
savings
banks
is
a
real
thing.
a
banker
in
new
haven
thinking
of
entering
bridgeport
would
be
foolish
not
to
consider
that
competition
for
that
amount
of
his
business.
i
will
leave
the
rest
of
my
time,
your
honor,
to
mr.
loevinger.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
was
decided
against
the
government
after
a
trial
in
which
the
district
court
heard
testimony
from
24
witnesses
whose
testimony
covered
more
than
2500
pages
and
after
the
district
court
reviewed
more
than
240
exhibits,
approximately
seven
months
after
the
conclusion
of
the
trial,
the
district
court
made
293
findings
of
fact
and
taken
apart
from
proposed
findings
submitted
by
the
government
and
part
from
those
submitted
from
the
defendants.
this
lengthy
record
covered
in
detail
as
required
by
branch
to
the
history,
structure
and
probable
future
of
banking
in
connecticut.
the
government
called
only
three
witnesses
in
this
case
in
chief.
the
first
witness
was
dr.
glans
who
testified
only
as
to
how
standard
metropolitan
statistical
areas
are
delineated.
he
was
not
offered
as
expert
in
banking
markets.
in
effect,
he
disclaimed
any
expertise
in
banking
markets.
he
agreed
that
smsa’s
are
determined
strictly
on
commuting
patterns
and
that
banking
is
not
one
of
the
criteria
used
in
determining
an
smsa.
he
said
that
cities
and
towns
in
the
new
england
area
are
much
more
meaningful
ways
of
analyzing
smsa’s
and
building
smsa’s
than
counties
as
in
other
parts
of
the
country
because
of
the
relatively
large
size
of
counties
in
connecticut.
he
testified
that
new
haven
and
bridgeport
were
two
separate
and
distinct
areas,
that
there
was
very
little,
if
any
cross
commuting
and
very
little,
if
any,
economic
integration
between
the
two.
he
said
that
the
city
of
--
the
population
of
the
city
of
new
haven
had
declined
by
about
20%
during
the
20-year
period
from
1950s
and
1970
and
that
the
population
of
the
city
of
bridgeport
declined
by
1.4%
during
the
same
period.
the
second
witness
called
by
the
government
was
dr.
neil
b.
murphy,
a
former
staff
member
of
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
who
had
worked
on
bank
mergers
there.
dr.
murphy
did
say
the
commercial
banks
were
unique
financial
institutions,
but
he
relied
primarily
on
the
demand
deposit
function
which
he
says
virtually
unique
to
commercial
banking.
he
said
its
the
most
important
service
offered
by
commercial
bank
which
is
not
authored
by
savings
banks.
now,
its
an
undisputed
fact
as
mr.
shapiro
had
said
that
savings
banks
in
the
state
of
connecticut
do
now
have
the
power,
effective
january
1,
1976,
to
offer
checking
accounts
and
accept
demand
deposits
in
the
state
of
connecticut,
thereby
eliminating
that
most
important
distinction.
he
generally
agreed
with
the
government,
that
as
dr.
murphy
that
smsa’s
at
the
outset
were
at
least
a
useful
starting
point
for
determining
banking
markets.
but
he
agreed
also,
dr.
murphy
that
they
were
not
used
to
analyze
banking
markets.
dr.
murphy
himself,
the
government’s
expert
said
in
an
article
he
wrote
that
increase
in
competition
among
commercial
banks
and
savings
type
institutions
or
savings
type
liabilities
suggest
to
some
reconsideration
of
the
product
line
may
be
an
order
and
he
said
this
is
especially
important
if
savings
banks
are
successful
in
obtaining
the
checking
account
privilege
which
they
now
have
in
connecticut
as
of
year-end
1975.
he
agreed
that
savings
banks
are
reasonable
substitutes
for
commercial
banks
in
connecticut
for
personal
loans.
he
agreed
that
savings
banks
in
fact
now
treat
savings
deposits
as
it
withdrawable
on
demand
even
though
they
do
have
the
right
to
ask
for
a
30-day
notice
before
allowing
withdrawal.
dr.
murphy,
the
government’s
expert
agreed
that
79%
of
connecticut
national’s
loan
portfolio
now
is
subject
to
competition
from
savings
banks.
he
agreed
that
a
commercial
banker,
considering
a
new
market
should
take
into
consideration
the
presence
of
savings
banks.
he
agreed
that
the
fact
of
the
population
of
new
haven
had
declined
about
20%
from
1950
to
1970
meant
that
it
was
not
a
very
good
place
to
put
a
new
bank
office
as
far
as
retail
business
is
concerned,
and
he
said
that
they
found
objective
evidence
he
would
not
put
a
bank
there.
he
agreed
that
banking
in
connecticut
has
become
more
competitive
between
1955
and
1971
because
of
more
alternatives
available
to
consumers.
he
agreed
that
the
proposed
merger
will
have
no
adverse
effect
at
the
present
time
on
small
borrowers,
small
depositors
or
small
businessmen
in
either
new
haven
or
bridgeport.
the
third
witness
called
by
the
government
was
mr.
benjamin
blackford
who
is
president
of
state
national
bank
in
bridgeport,
a
competitor
of
connecticut
national
bank.
state
national
bank
is
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
s&h
green
stamps
combined
connecticut
state
national
and
s&h
green
stamps
have
assets
in
the
neighborhood
of
a
billion
dollars
and
earnings
in
a
neighborhood
of
$30
million
a
year
compared
to
$3.75
million
for
connecticut
national
bank.
mr.
blackford
testified,
if
he
was
not
familiar
with
the
phrase
standard
metropolitan
area
and
he
did
not
know
what
made
it
up
or
what
it
meant.
he
also
testified
that
state
national
was
a
one
price
bank,
that
is
it
does
not
charge
discriminatory
prices
and
charge
the
same
throughout
its
service
area.
he
said
that
state
national
is
in
competition
with
savings
banks
with
one
hand
tied
behind
our
back.
he
said
that
every
bank
in
the
area
he
feels
they
compete
with
new
york
banks
for
trust
business.
he
said
state
national
has
a
lot
of
customers
who
work
in
new
york.
he
said
a
few
of
these
big
mutual
savings
bank
around
here
gives
us
all
the
competition
we
need,
and
he
said
he
takes
into
account
savings
bank
competition
when
he
considers
opening
a
new
branch
because
as
he
said,
“if
you
can’t
beat
them
on
price,
you
got
to
beat
on
service.”
mr.
blackford
was
a
concluding
witness
in
the
government’s
case
in
chief.
the
government
called
only
one
other
witness.
that
was
mr.
peter
stass,
the
president
of
lafayette
bank
and
trust
company
who
is
called
in
rebuttal.
mr.
stass
also
said
that
he
did
not
consider
the
smsa
concept
one
way
or
the
other
as
being
the
market
of
lafayette.
he
testified,
“i
think
we
have
our
own
description
of
what
our
market
is”
and
he
said
that
the
bank’s
market
was
primarily
where
it
had
its
offices.
he
testified
also
that
competition
--
that
his
competition
included
every
other
bank
and
he
specifically
include
savings
banks
within
that
competition.
the
defendants
and
intervenor
called
20
witnesses,
including
two
economists,
one
dr.
burton
j.
peck,
the
chairman
of
the
economics
department
of
yale
university
and
the
other
dr.
charles
dopes,
the
former
chairman
of
the
economics
department
of
university
of
bridgeport.
both
of
these
witnesses
who
detailed
familiarity
with
the
market
and
the
area,
geographic
area
in
connecticut
and
both
of
whom
are
experts
in
structural
competition
and
potential
competition
testified
that
as
economist,
they
saw
no
adverse
effect
on
the
structure
of
potential
competition
or
any
of
its
parts
on
the
proposed
merger.
dr.
peck
took
the
government’s
assumptions
on
the
significance
of
potential
competition
and
he
applied
them
to
connecticut.
he
assumed
that
commercial
banking
was
a
line
of
commerce.
he
assumed
that
entry
into
the
close
towns
of
new
haven
and
bridgeport
might
occur
sometime
in
the
future
and
he
assumed
that
potential
competition
has
some
significance
in
the
field
of
banking.
he
prepared
a
detailed
study
of
the
structure
of
potential
competition
in
connecticut
based
on
these
three
assumptions
of
the
government
and
concluded
that
even
on
these
assumptions
the
proposed
merger
will
have
no
adverse
effect
on
the
structure
of
potential
competition
in
connecticut.
he
found
that
following
a
proposed
merger
that
would
be
no
less
than
four
firms
identified
by
the
government
as
potential
entrants
in
each
for
the
major
banking
markets
in
connecticut.
the
district
court
found
based
on
dr.
peck’s
testimony
that
no
first
rank
potential
entrant
would
be
eliminated
by
the
merger
and
then
the
21
of
40
closed
towns,
there
are
now
48
closed
towns
of
169
that
theoretically
eliminated
potential
entrant
ranked
seven
out
of
ten.
the
court
also
based
on
dr.peck’s
testimony
that
in
52
open
towns,
nine
potential
entrants
identified
by
the
government
as
having
statewide
expansion
capability
would
remain
after
consolidation.
in
15
large
towns
in
connecticut
with
over
50,000
in
population,
dr.
peck
testified
and
the
district
court
found
that
there
are
no
fewer
than
four
banks
identified
by
the
plaintiff
as
capable
of
expanding
in
the
statewide
systems
which
would
remain
as
potential
entrants
after
the
proposed
consolidation.
for
example
in
hartford,
first
new
haven
ranks
fifth
in
size
among
the
ten
largest
theoretical
potential
commercial
bank
entrants.
at
the
present
time,
first
new
haven
would
rank
no
better
than
fourth
among
theoretical
potential
entrants
into
bridgeport.
now,
mr.
shapiro
has
said
first
new
haven
is
the
most
likely
entrant
into
bridgeport.
i
simply
don’t
understand
that.
hartford
national
which
has
$1.7
billion
of
assets
is
not
now
in
the
city
of
bridgeport
and
on
the
government’s
theory
that
is
the
mostly
likely
entrant
into
bridgeport.
under
the
government’s
theory,
the
second
most
likely
entrant
into
the
city
of
bridgeport
is
union
trust
company
with
over
$700
million
of
assets.
it
is
not
now
in
bridgeport.
under
the
government’s
theory
is
the
third
largest
potential
entrant
into
bridgeport
is
colonial
bank
and
trust
company
of
waterbury
which
is
larger
than
first
new
haven.
the
district
court
found
based
on
dr.
peck’s
testimony
before
the
merger,
there
are
five
potential
entrants
into
new
haven
ranked
by
the
government
as
capable
of
becoming
statewide
banks.
after
the
consolidation
there
would
be
four.
the
district
court
found
that
since
five
of
connecticut’s
largest
commercial
banks
already
operate
in
new
haven,
they
have
more
impact
on
competition
there
than
there
is
possibility
of
potential
entry
by
connecticut
national.
the
five
banks
in
new
haven
now
are
connecticut
bank
and
trust
company
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
mr.
justice
white,
the
government
offered
no
evidence
on
perceived
potential
entry.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
understand
mr.
justice
white
that
in
analyzing
either
of
these
concepts,
the
government
does
look
at
who
is
the
most
likely
and
then
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
deny
that
connecticut
national
is
national
potential
entrant
into
new
haven.
the
discussion
of
potential
competition
in
the
state
of
connecticut
was
based
on
the
government’s
assumptions,
namely
that
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
think
the
most
important
thing
that
the
government
is
to
show
mr.
justice
white
is
that
the
potential
entrant,
the
claimed
potential
entrant
would
have
entered
the
town,
but
for
the
acquisition.
i
say
of
course
that
the
government
did
not
prove
that.
new
haven
is
a
closed
town
and
connecticut
national
could
not
enter
new
haven.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
well,
i
would
think
so
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
i
would
think
so
because
if
the
most
likely
entrant
is
the
one
who
is
most
likely
--
i
do
not
know
what’s
to
add
to
that,
and
the
question
is,
what
is
the
importance
of
eliminating
a
less
likely
entrant
if
the
fourth
most
likely
entrant
is
being
eliminated
theoretically
then
there
are
three
left
who
are
more
likely.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
yes,
mr.
justice
white,
i
think
that
if
the
government
had
proved
that
connecticut
national
would
have
entered
the
city
of
new
haven
by
other
means
then
they
would
have
advanced
their
cause.
i
agree
with
you
they
did
not
prevail.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
well,
i
think
that
it
is
a
question
of
fact
as
to
whether
they
would
have
entered
and
in
my
conception
of
the
evidence
in
this
case,
the
government
didn’t
make
a
serious
attempt
even
to
prove
that
they
would
have
entered.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
well,
on
objective
facts
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
say
that
the
objective
facts
as
to
likelihood
of
entry
would
be
based
upon
the
size
of
the
potential
entrant
and
that
the
larger
the
entry
the
more
likely
--
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
if
the
government
is
correct
that
new
haven
banks
can
enter
the
city
of
bridgeport
and
if
first
new
haven
was
eliminated
as
one
of
the
less
firms
which
would
have,
but
did
not
then
the
reserve
question,
mr.
justice
white,
i
would
say
that
would
--
the
government
would
argue
so
that
was
a
loss
of
competitor
in
that
area.
mr.
george
d.
reycraft
[laughter
attempt]
i
would
agree
that
six
competitors
generally
mean
more
competition
than
five.
it’s
a
question
of
substantiality
however,
whether
the
likelihood
of
that,
elimination
of
that
possibility
would
substantially
lessen
competition
and
that
is
what
i
say
the
government
has
failed
to
prove.
professor
stokes,
who
is
on
leave
from
the
university
of
bridgeport,
also
testified
that
the
proposed
merger
would
have
no
effect
on
the
structure
of
potential
competition
in
connecticut.
the
defendants
and
the
intervenor
called
18
other
witnesses
who
were
bankers
and
businessmen
from
the
city
of
new
haven
who
testified
generally
on
competition
and
generally
agreed
that
commercial
banks
and
savings
banks
were
in
very
substantial
competition
within
the
state.
the
structure
of
bank
in
connecticut
is
highly
competitive.
the
number
of
commercial
banks
has
increased
during
the
last
11
years
and
the
alternatives
available
to
consumers
has
increased
in
majority
of
connecticut’s
169
towns.
as
of
year
end
1963,
there
were
64
commercial
banks
in
connecticut,
as
of
the
close
of
the
record
there
were
also
64
commercial
banks
in
connecticut.
since
the
close
of
the
record
as
mr.
shapiro
has
indicated
eight
new
commercial
banks
have
been
chartered,
so
there
are
now
72
commercial
banks
in
connecticut
compared
to
64
twelve
years
ago.
so
that
this
alone
demonstrates
that
the
most
likely
entrance
in
the
commercial
banking
in
the
city
--
in
the
state
of
connecticut
are
investors
and
not
other
banks.
there
has
been
no
occasion
in
the
history
of
banking
in
connecticut
when
any
bank
holding
companies
or
bank
has
followed
the
route
proposed
by
mr.
shapiro
which
is
to
the
so
called
holding
company
new
charter
route.
the
state
commissioner
of
banking
testified
that
it
had
never
happened
in
the
state
of
connecticut.
he
said
that
if
it
were
done,
it
would
result
in
a
beguile
call
of
fury
from
other
banks
with
litigation.
the
state
of
connecticut
also
has
a
form
which
applicants
for
a
new
bank
charter
are
required
to
fill
out.
that
form
says
this
bank
is
not
be
to
organized
for
the
purpose
of
selling,
merging
or
combining
with
any
state
bank
or
trust
company
or
national
bank
now
in
existence.
so
in
order
to
file
a
procedure
that
the
government
is
suggesting
in
this
case,
it
would
require
full
statements
by
the
applicants
in
order
to
get
a
state
bank
charter.
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
has
only
charted
three
banks
in
the
state
of
connecticut
since
1963
and
two
of
these
banks
were
what
are
called
interim
banks
which
were
formed
for
the
purpose
of
facilitating
the
elimination
of
minority
shareholders
in
a
bank
holding
company
in
hartford.
for
the
state
as
a
whole,
commercial
banking
options
for
retail
customers
have
in
increased
in
94
of
the
169
connecticut
towns
and
they
have
decreased
in
only
three
towns
between
1955
and
1971.
there
are
more
alternatives
today
in
fairfield
county
in
19
of
23
fairfield
county
towns
than
they
were
in
1955
and
a
more
alternatives
in
22
of
27
new
haven
county
towns
than
1955.
among
the
119
towns
in
connecticut
outside
fairfield
and
new
haven
counties,
the
number
of
commercial
banking
options
has
increased
in
53,
remains
unchanged
in
65
and
decreased
in
only
one
such
town.
even
dr.
murphy,
the
government’s
expert
witness
conceded
that
banking
in
connecticut
has
become
more
competitive
since
1955.
the
government
has
raised
essentially
four
issues
here,
whether
the
two
banks
are
significant
potential
entrants
into
each
others
markets,
whether
standard
metropolitan
statistical
areas
are
really
without
more
banking
markets,
whether
the
two
banks
are
significant
potential
entrants
into
other
local
banking
areas
in
connecticut,
and
fourth
whether
existing
competition
from
savings
banks
and
existing
competition
from
new
york
bank
should
be
totally
disregarded
in
determining
the
impact
on
the
structure
of
potential
competition
in
connecticut.
now,
the
district
court
found
against
the
government
on
all
of
this
issues
which
are
essentially
factual,
which
are
factual
issues.
the
government’s
argument
on
standard
metropolitan
statistical
areas
apparently
was
important
to
it
in
this
case
unlike
its
position
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case,
philipsburg,
brown
shoe
and
nashville
because
it
could
not
show
that
these
banks
were
likely
entrants
into
the
home
office
cities
of
the
others
because
they
were
closed.
in
order
to
show
an
entry
into
a
banking
market,
it
was
necessary
to
show
that
entry
into
a
suburban
town
somewhere
near
new
haven
would
be
adequate.
the
only
witness
who
testified
that
smsas
where
banking
markets
was
dr.
murphy
who
did
testify
he
had
the
no
familiarity
with
geography
of
the
banking
in
connecticut.
dr.
peck
who
was
familiar
with
the
area
who
teaches
at
yale
university
said
that
the
acquisition
of
for
example
a
small
bank
in
woodridge,
connecticut
would
not
be
ineffective
entry
into
the
new
haven
area
and
to
compete
with
first
new
haven
national
bank.
the
woodridge
bank
and
trust
company
has
about
$8
million
assets.
it
has
about
one
office.
it
is
not
allowed
to
branch
into
new
haven
because
that’s
a
closed
town
of
the
eleven
towns
in
the
new
haven
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area,
six
are
closed.
in
the
bridgeport
standard
metropolitan
statistical
area,
six
out
of
eight
of
the
towns
are
closed,
so
that
new
entry
into
those
towns
is
not
legally
permissible
at
the
present
time.
on
the
question
of
banking
markets,
both
the
government
and
the
defendants
in
this
case
agree
that
the
state
of
connecticut
is
appropriate
area
to
look
at
in
appraising
this
particular
bank
merger.
the
reason
is
because
as
defendants,
we
apply
this
court’s
test
in
the
philadelphia
national
bank
case
which
is
at
the
relevant
section
of
the
country
to
look
at
as
a
area
within
which
state
law
permits
banks
to
branch
or
merge
and
that’s
subject
to
home
office
protection
is
the
state
of
connecticut.
now,
we
don’t
say
that
the
state
of
connecticut
is
a
banking
market
in
which
first
new
haven
and
connecticut
national
compete
as
mr.
shapiro
does.
he
goes
from
the
assumption
that
if
connecticut
is
banking
market
therefore
everybody
in
the
state
must
compete
within
it.
the
facts
are
and
he
concedes
the
facts
are
that
they
do
not.
connecticut
national’s
primary
service
area
is
fairfield
county
where
most
of
its
offices
are
located.
first
new
havens
banking
area
is
essentially
southern
new
haven
county
and
there
is
a
small
area
of
interaction
between
them
and
the
four
town
area
that
mr.
shapiro
described,
but
other
than
that
they
are
not
in
competition
with
each
other.
there
are
smaller
banks
in
the
state
which
do
operate
strictly
on
a
local
basis.
for
example,
woodridge
bank
and
trust
company
that
we
have
referred
to
operates
strictly
in
woodridge.
the
government's
own
exhibit
show
that
in
the
town
of
fairfield,
connecticut
national’s
fairfield
office
gets
only
77.1%
of
its
business
from
writ
--
people
who
has
statement
addresses
in
the
town
of
fairfield
and
is
highly
localized.
they
show
that
83.1%
of
the
deposits
of
connecticut
national
trumbull
office
originate
in
trumbull.
so
for
the
small
customer,
he
is
limited
to
the
area
in
which
he
lives.
for
the
larger
customers,
however,
the
choice
has
increased
dramatically.
new
york
banks
as
much
as
shapiro
has
conceded
obtained
close
to
$500
million
of
banking
business
from
the
state
of
connecticut.
now
that's
just
banking
business
that
we
are
able
to
prove
as
a
result
of
a
survey
done
with
the
assistance
of
a
special
master.
we
served
deposition
notices
and
subpoenas
on
new
york
banks
and
while
we
encountered
a
good
deal
of
resistance
and
it
took
a
good
deal
of
time,
we
were
able
to
prove
nearly
$500
million
of
banking
businesses
which
these
banks
alone
get
out
of
the
state
of
connecticut.
this
is
significant
for
commuters
also
between
new
haven
and
--
between
connecticut
and
new
york,
the
choices
are
substantial.
the
government’s
own
exhibit
showed
that
there
are
50,000
people
who
cross
commute
between
connecticut
and
new
york.
about
25,000
go
from
connecticut
to
new
york
and
about
25,000
come
back
from
new
york
to
work
in
connecticut.
there
is
substantial
cross
commutation
and
the
government’s
evidence
shows
that
it’s
increasing.
now,
if
these
commuters
or
these
cross
commuters
represented
only
one
employed
person
per
household
of
five,
that
would
be
the
equivalent
of
the
city
of
250,000
people
which
is
larger
either
the
city
of
new
haven
or
the
city
of
bridgeport.
in
fairfield
county,
the
combined
circulation
of
the
new
york
times
and
the
new
york
daily
news
exceeds
by
six
to
one
the
circulation
of
the
only
local
newspaper
circulated
in
bridgeport
which
is
the
bridgeport
post
telegram.
television
advertisement
by
new
york
banks
saturates
the
lower
connecticut
area.
the
new
york
banks
do
advertise
of
personal
loans,
retail
loans,
savings
deposits.
now,
we
say
for
this
reason
that
the
government’s
statistics,
their
so
called
concentration
ratios
are
highly
suspect
or
highly
attenuated
not
only
for
the
reason
of
the
effect
that
new
york
banks
have
on
connecticut,
but
also
because
of
savings
bank
competition.
if
a
banker
in
new
haven
were
considering
entering
the
city
of
bridgeport,
he
would
have
to
consider
the
fact
that
when
he
went
into
bridgeport,
he
would
be
competing
with
connecticut
bank
and
trust
company
with
1.8
billion
of
assets,
hartford
national
with
1.7
billion
of
assets.
with
connecticut
national,
he
would
be
competing
with
people’s
savings
banks
with
over
700
million
of
assets
and
the
government’s
own
evidence
shows
that
over
70%
of
this
business
is
in
competition
with
savings
banks.
so,
whether
the
court
decides
that
savings
banks
should
be
included
in
the
line
of
commerce
or
analyze
it
strictly
in
commercial
banking
terms,
the
effect
of
that
competition
from
savings
banks
is
a
real
thing.
a
banker
in
new
haven
thinking
of
entering
bridgeport
would
be
foolish
not
to
consider
that
competition
for
that
amount
of
his
business.
i
will
leave
the
rest
of
my
time,
your
honor,
to
mr.
loevinger.
