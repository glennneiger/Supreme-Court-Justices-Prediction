are
you
bringing
the
interest
question
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
you
abandoning
then?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
have
briefed
it
that’s
why
i’m
asking.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
my
question
is,
as
i
read
your
brief
you
bring
all
five
points
here,
and
yet
in
your
petition
for
certiorari
you
cover
only
three,
and
therefore,
i
asked
why
they’re
trying
to
bring
all
five
as
a
violation
of
our
rule
40.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
maybe
that’s
something
you
can
take
up
later
but
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
two
in
question
are
the
interest
point
and
the
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
point
number
two,
the
extension
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
right.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suspect
those
two
issues
are
not
here
but
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
the
reason
you
had
a
different
surety
is
because
it
was
a
different
job.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
that
these
two
shipments
come
to
california
clearly
it
would
be
under
the
transamerica
bond.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
gochberg,
on
the
attorney’s
fee
point
you
do
have
the
richter
case
going
for
you,
don’t
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
isn’t
that
something
in
your
favor?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
if
you
could
win
on
state
ground,
you
just
sue
and
win
on
that
ground,
wouldn’t
you,
in
this
case?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you’re
not
purporting
to
say
though
that
the
federal
court
could
override
the
decision
of
the
california
court
of
appeal
with
respect
to
state
law
in
any
event?
