justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
materialman
can
get
a
relief,
but
the
supplier
to
the
materialman
cannot.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that’s
a
contradiction
in
terms
so
far
as
normal
legal
usage
is
concerned,
isn't
it?
i
mean
jurisdiction
is
one
thing,
venue
is
another
and
venue
can
be
waived.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
judge
wisdom’s
opinion
on
red
top
refers
to
state
law
for
the
source
of
attorney’s
fees,
doesn’t
it,
and
pretty
much
as
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
one
of
your
arguments
i
suppose
is
that
the
miller
act
is
really
a
substitute
not
for
a
state
miller
act,
but
for
the
private
materialman’s
lien
that
you
have
in
a
private
job
and
there
you
don’t
get
attorney’s
fees
under
california
law.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
give
towards
an
amount?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
harlowe,
why
isn’t
it
then
that
you
look
to
state
law
for
deciding
whether
under
the
miller
act
you
get
attorney’s
fees?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay,
now
but
then
if
you
look
to
california
law
on
that
kind
of
a
lien,
you
don’t
get
attorney’s
fees,
do
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
a
private
materialman’s
action
without
the
state
being
involved
in
any
way?
it
was
my
impression
that
under
the
california
law
you
didn’t
get
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
that
under
the
appellate
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
california
law
you
get
attorney’s
fees
now
even
though
it’s
a
private
party
on
all
sides
and
private
ownership
of
the
land?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
that
isn’t
the
ground
that
court
of
appeals
told
you,
is
it?
it
is,
as
i
read,
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
it
relied
on
the
fact
that
under
california
law,
under
california’s
equivalent
of
the
miller
act
where
you’re
working
on
a
state
project,
you
get
attorney’s
fees?
as
i
read
that
opinion,
they
didn’t
rely
on
the
section
that
you
cite
that
you
say
now
provides
for
attorney’s
fees
even
in
a
private
action.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
though
the
land
was
in
california?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
if
you
are
talking
about
the
substitute
materialman’s
bond,
you’re
talking
about
california
law.
justice
william
h.
