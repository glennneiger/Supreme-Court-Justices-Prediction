mr.
lawrence
gochberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
miller
act
40
u.s.c.
270b.
it
involves
a
suit
by
a
supplier
of
a
middle
party,
cerpac,
supplied
plywood
to
the
general
contractor,
the
f.d.
rich
co.
for
a
federal
project
at
the
beale
air
force
base
in
california.
the
court
and
the
district
court
found
in
favor
of
the
supplier
on
a
number
of
issues.
it
denied
attorney’s
fees
and
appeal
was
taken
by
the
rich
co.
and
industrial
lumber
took
a
cross-appeal.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court
on
as
to
the
denial
of
attorney’s
fees,
and
also
reversed
on
an
interest
question
as
to
whether
7%
or
8%
interest
should
be
granted
under
california
law,
and
affirmed
on
all
other
issues
against
--
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
no,
your
honor,
i
think
it
will
--
i
am
not
prepared
to
argue
that.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
i
think
we
briefed
it
shortly.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
we
briefed
it,
i’m
not
abandoning
in
it
but
it
do
have
three
other
issues
that
i
would
like
to
argue
that
i
think
are
more
--
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
i
am
sorry.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
if
that
is
true.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
and
the
90-day,
the
standard.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
yes,
the
standard
of
the
90
days.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
i
think
that
is
true
and
i
do
believe
that
there
has
been
an
inadvertent
violation
of
your
rules,
if
it
is
so
then
i
stand
correct
and
i
will
--
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
i
did
not
intend
to
argue
them
in
any
event,
and
i
will
abide
by
the
court’s
rules
on
the
matter.
i
apologize
for
the
oversight.
the
plaintiff
below,
the
contract
involved
here,
was
cerpac
and
industrial,
and
cerpac
and
rich.
rich
being
the
general
contractor,
cerpac
being
the
supplier,
and
industrial
being
supplier,
was
for
standard
manufactured
plywood
and
a
simple
contract
for
the
furnishing
of
that
plywood
was
given
from
rich
to
cerpac,
and
in
turn
from
cerpac
to
industrial,
and
industrial
caused
the
material,
plywood,
to
be
shipped
directly
to
rich’s
job
at
the
beale
air
force
base
in
california.
what
happened
was
that
during
the
course
of
the
job,
that’s
toward
the
end
of
it,
cerpac
became
in
financial
trouble
went
bankrupt
despite
the
payments
from
rich
to
with,
and
industrial
is
now
sought
to
bring
a
miller
act
suit
seeking
to
collect
for
the
plywood.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
ninth
circuit
has
adverted
to
the
fact
that
cerpac
was
an
important
member
and
subcontractor
of
the
rich
co.,
relying
on
the
fact
that
not
only
that
cerpac
have
a
contract
to
supply
plywood,
but
it
also
had
a
separate
contract
to
supply
millwork.
the
millwork
issue
was
not
at
all
in
the
case.
in
this
case,
it
was
only
introduced
and
used
in
this
case
to
point
out
that
cerpac
was
an
important
supplier
and/or
“subcontractor
of
the
f.d.
rich
co.”
the
fact
is,
however,
that
in
this
particular
case,
industrial
supplied
plywood
to
cerpac
who
in
turn
supplied
the
same
plywood
to
rich.
it
would
seem
to
be
that
at
least
since
the
macevoy
decision
in
322
u.s.,
that
relationship
can
give
rise
to
nothing
but
a
materialman,
and
a
supplier
of
a
materialman
under
the
miller
act
has
long
been
understood
to
be
too
far
to
receive
any
relief
under
the
miller
act.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
yes.
anyone
having
a
direct
contract
with
the
general
contractor
under
270b
(a),
a
direct
contract
does
not
have
to
give
notice
and
after
90
days
of
not
being
paid
may
bring
a
suit
against
the
principal,
which
is
the
general
contractor
and
at
surety
here,
transamerica.
and
that’s
whether
he
be
a
materialman
or
a
subcontractor
and
it
is
unimportant,
which
he
is.
however,
if
you
do
not
have
a
direct
contract
with
the
general
contractor,
you
can
still
get
relief
under
the
miller
act
bond
if
you
have
a
contract
with
the
subcontractor,
and
that
goes
from
the
language
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
macevoy
against
united
states,
322
u.s.
102,
i
believe.
and
it
really
talks
about
the
language
in
the
case,
which
states
that
in
the
proviso
that
any
person
having
a
direct
contractual
relationship
with
the
subcontractor
but
no
contractual
relationship
express
or
implied
with
the
contractor,
that
is
the
general
contractor,
furnishing
said
payment
bond
shall
give
notice
and
then
goes
on
to
say
he
has
a
right
of
action.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
bringing
in
what
was
a
really
of
strenuous
matter
is
the
fact
that,
there
was
a
contract
between
rich
and
cerpac,
under
which
cerpac
supplied
no
work.
by
the
way,
the
court
and
it’s
not
borne
out
by
anything
in
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
the
court
held
that
cerpac
installed
the
millwork,
but
that
is
completely
untrue
and
it
is
not
adverted
to
in
the
brief
for
the
respondent.
well,
be
that
as
it
may,
we
suggest
to
you
that
the
proper
test
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
cerpac
was
a
materialman
or
a
subcontractor,
is
the
test
set
forth
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
aetna
casualty
co.
against
gibson
steel
co.,
382
f.2d
615,
in
that
case
the
supplier
or
the
middle
man
was
a
metal
supplied
steel
and
iron
products,
and
if
fact
customized
some
of
the
products.
he
made
ladders
and
deck
plates,
and
switch
plates,
and
various
steel
and
iron
products
costumed
for
the
particular
government
contract
and
supplied
them,
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
there
that
he
was
a
materialman.
the
virtue
of
adopting
the
gibson
steel
approach
is
that
we
don’t
have
to
get
into
this
almost
future
interest
type
of
discussion
of
the
law.
a
man
is
either
a
subcontractor
or
a
materialman,
and
in
the
macevoy
case,
this
court
held
that
if
he
takes
over
and
is
important
and
does
a
lot
of
the
work,
he
may
become
a
subcontractor,
but
if
he
is
one
that
merely
supplies
material,
he
is
a
materialman.
the
respondent
has
ceased
in
his
brief
on
the
fact
that
during
a
deposition,
one
of
the
officers
of
the
f.d.
rich
co.
stated
that
cerpac
was
a
subcontractor
for
the
plywood.
i
only
point
out
to
you
that
this
court
in
322
u.s.
in
the
macevoy
case
in
footnote
4
also
stated
that
any
use
by
the
court
previous
to
that
time
of
the
loose
use
of
the
word
“subcontractor
materialman”
by
the
supreme
court
would
not
be
binding
on
it.
i
ask
the
court
to
view
this
in
the
--
that
it
is
unimportant
as
to
what
mr.
rich
who
was
giving
the
deposition
happened
to
call
cerpac.
what
is
important
is
an
examination
of
what
the
function
he
did,
and
not
what
his
relationship
was
but
the
function
that
he
performed.
and
his
function
was
to
supply
plywood
which
he
bought
from
industrial,
so,
therefore
as
a
materialman
of
the
materialman,
and
clearly
interdicted
by
the
macevoy
case.
now,
another
question
of
that
venue
and
then
i
want
to
come
to
the
attorney’s
fees
question,
which
is
of
great
interest.
on
the
question
of
venue,
the
statute
very
clearly
says
270
--
40
u.s.c.
270b
(b),
every
suit
instituted
under
this
section
shall
be
brought
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
etcetera,
in
the
unites
states
district
court
for
any
district
in
which
the
court
was
to
be
performed
and
executed,
and
not
elsewhere.
now,
starting
with
the
language
in
justice
brandeis'
language
in
illinois
surety
co.
against
the
john
davis
co.
which
this
court
then
in
a
dictum
used
in
the
macevoy
case
at
322
u.s.
in
which
you
said
that
this
miller
act
is
a
remedial
statute
and
you
ought
to
liberally
construe
it.
the
lower
courts
have
absolutely
gone
wild
and
they’ve
liberally
construed
it
so
that
they
forgotten
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
they
have
forgotten
the
ratio
decidendi
of
the
macevoy
case.
the
macevoy
case,
you
clearly
stated
that
even
though
it
has
to
be
liberally
construed,
there
is
no
way
to
impose
liability
on
a
materialman
or
a
materialman
claim
words
of
the
statute
may
not
be
disregarded.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
does
not
believe
the
ratio
decidendi
of
the
macevoy
case
and
it
has
stated
that
even
though
two
of
the
shipments
involved
here
were
sent
by
industrial
to
south
carolina
for
a
different
contract,
different
federal
contract
on
which
there
was
a
different
surety
that
venue
could
be
had
in
the
district
court
for
california
for
recovery
of
those
two
shipments.
the
court
however
realized
that
it
was
kind
of
embarrassing
since
transamerica
insurance
co.
was
not
the
surety
for
the
south
carolina
job.
[laughter
attempt]
so
it
said
“alright,
we’re
holding
that
the
principle
under
the
beale
bond,
i.e.
the
general
contractor
f.d.
rich
co.
is
liable,
but
we’re
excusing
transamerica.”
well,
you
know
the
bond
is
only
one
instrument
where
either
you
can’t
be
a
little
bit
pregnant
about
this
whether
liable
or
were
not
liable.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
yes,
sir.
there
were
two
different
federal
jobs.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
no
question
mr.
justice
blackmun.
and
in
the
court,
i
really
don’t
understand
the
court,
because
it’s
a
circuit
which
i
have
often
admired
and
i
just
didn’t
understand
their
decision
here
on
that
issue
of
saying
that
the
south
carolina
shipments
for
a
different
job
was
somehow
cognizable
under
the
district
court
here.
judge
wollenberg
in
the
roscoe
case
--
judge
wollenberg
in
u.s.
against
roscoe
ajax
in
246
f.
supp.
439
has
set
down
a
splendid
exposition
of
the
venue
statute,
and
he
has
said
that
the
venue
statute
is
jurisdictional
and
cannot
be
disregarded
by
the
courts.
in
other
words,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
which
says
“and
not
elsewhere”
must
be
enforced.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
but
this,
you
know,
this
is
semantic
problem.
it
is
a
semantic
problem.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
did
not
use
the
word
“venue.”
the
congress
of
the
united
states
said
that
anybody
who
wants
to
sue
under
the
miller
act
must
sue
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
any
district
in
which
the
contract
was
to
be
performed
and
executed
and
not
elsewhere.
we,
lawyers
and
we
lower
courts,
and
hopefully
not
the
supreme
court,
have
introduced
concepts
of
venue
and
jurisdiction.
i
agree
with
you.
judge
wollenberg
agrees
with
you.
he
says
that
it
is
not
a
venue
problem;
it's
a
jurisdictional
problem
and
cannot
be
waived.
in
that
case,
he
refused
to
allow
two
parties
to
change
the
venue
that
they
had
in
a
private
contract.
you
considered
this
question
in
passing
in
the
moseley
case.
in
moseley,
you
considered
it
on
the
question
where
the
contract
had
an
arbitration
clause
and
you
considered
the
effect
of
arbitration,
united
states
arbitration
statute,
on
the
miller
act
and
on
this
jurisdictional
point.
and
there
you
send
it
back
and
it
was
inconclusive
and
never
decided
because
there
was
a
question
of
fraud
and
you
held
that
it
should
go
back
to
the
district
court,
but
in
a
concurring
opinion,
i
think
it
was
concurring,
the
chief
justice
warren
pointed
out
that
there
were
problems
and
judge
wollenberg
has
dealt
with
that
issue
in
the
roscoe
ajax
case.
the
most
fascinating
part
of
the
court
of
appeals’
decision,
aside
from
this
venue
question
on
which
i
submit
they
are
clearly
wrong,
and
on
the
question
of
the
materialman,
is
the
court’s
action
on
attorney’s
fees.
the
attorney
fee
question
has
been
plaguing
the
lower
courts
and
lawyers
who
represent
surety
companies
as
well
as
contractors
for
the
last
10
or
15
years.
for
a
time
there,
nobody
even
thought
that
to
ask
for
attorney’s
fees,
and
then
suddenly
lawyers
are
starting
to
ask
and,
lo
and
behold,
federal
courts
are
beginning
to
grant
attorney’s
fees,
this
court
held
in
the
fleischmann
case,
fleischmann
against
maier
involving
the
lanham
act
that
only
congress,
at
least
in
our
courts,
gives
attorney’s
fees,
and
it’s
pointed
out
that
this
has
been
that
in
american
jurisprudence,
attorney’s
fees
are
not
granted
absent
a
specific
statute
or
a
contract
which
provides
for
them.
in
that
case
the
lanham
act,
you
held
that
the
lanham
act
set
forth
the
remedies,
and
therefore
that
was
the
end
of
it
and
attorney’s
fees
could
not
be
granted
regardless
of
the
public
policy
to
encourage
actions
under
lanham
act
or
not.
in
the
miller
act,
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
relying
on
the
red
top
metal,
inc.
case,
the
fifth
circuit
case
and
relying
on
the
broad
language
of
mr.
justice
brandeis’
decision
in
the
illinois
surety
co.
case
that
attorney’s
fees
should
be
awarded.
and
this
is
a
curious
situation,
a
curious
result.
the
appellate,
intermediate
appellate
court
in
california
in
the
richter
case
quoted
in
the
opinion
of
the
appellate
court
has
held
that
--
had
held
in
another
type
of
bond,
not
a
miller
act
bond
that
the
california
law
had
no
application
to
a
private
construction
projects
or
to
projects
of
the
united
states.
the
lower
court
followed
that
case,
and
the
appellate
court
reversed
and
approved
judge
macbride,
the
chief
judge
of
the
eastern
district
of
california’s
decision,
which
is
cited
in
the
opinion.
the
court
approved
this
language
and
it
held
that
federal
law
and
hedl
that
under
the
policy
of
california
law,
not
its
letter,
attorney’s
fees
were
recoverable
and
miller
act
cases
to
be
taxed
as
costs.
now,
this
situation
was
foresaw
by
the
red
top
metal’s
case
in
which
judge
wisdom
in
a
very
well
written
decision
with
an
erroneous
result
in
the
fifth
circuit
has
reasoned
through
this
whole
question
of
the
attorney’s
fees.
he
reasoned
and
he
said
“well
no,
you
can’t
look
to
state
statute
law,
because
the
states
aren’t
legislating
for
congress,
and
it
really
is
a
federal
question.”
but
he
found
that
the
miller
act
had
a
hiatus
and
we
look
to
the
state
law
to
fill
in
the
hiati,
if
that
is
the
plural
or
the
hiatuses.
he
really
did
something
that
this
court
seems
to
have
done
in
the
electric
auto-lite
case
involving
the
section
14
(a)
of
the
security
act
of
1934.
in
that
case
if
you
recall,
in
finding
that
there
was
a
private
remedy
under
section
14
(a),
this
court
also
held
that
you
could
award
attorney’s
fees.
and
it
held
that
it
had
a
right
to
do
so
because
congress
had
left
to
you
the
question
of
interpretation
of
whether
there
is
a
private
remedy
under
section
14
(a)
and
therefore,
you
could
write
the
entire
remedy
including
the
attorney’s
fees.
and
you
distinguished
the
fleischmann
case
in
which
would
clearly
lay
down
a
very
clear
line
of
law
saying
that
where
there’s
a
federal
statute
involved
and
the
statute
doesn’t
involve
attorney’s
fees,
the
lower
courts
are
not
to
grant
them.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
yes,
but
that
is
an
interpretation
by
a
state
court
of
a
state
law.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
and
literally
--
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
well,
i
think
i
have
the
fleischmann
case
that
this
court
decided
in
our
favor,
because
i
think
the
remedy
under
the
miller
act
which
says
exactly
what
the
subcontractor,
a
materialman
is
to
recover
is
identical
with
the
remedy
set
forth
in
the
lanham
act.
and
you
have
interpreted
the
lanham
act
that
way
and
you
ought
to
interpret
the
miller
act
that
way,
and
we
ought
not
to
get
into
constant
litigation
as
to
whether
or
not
something
which
is
clearly
decided
by
the
supreme
court
is
to
be
eroded
now.
we
must
have
40
cases
now
on
attorneys,
and
some
circuits
give
them
and
in
texas,
a
federal
contractor
--
now
in
texas,
you
don’t
have
to
pay
attorney’s
fees
if
you
lose
--
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
as
an
old
member
of
the
department
of
justice
and
an
associate
of
mr.
freidman,
i
would
hope
to
win
on
a
broader
issue,
but
i
wouldn’t
like
to
win
on
anything.
i
do
think
the
issue
was
more
important
than
the
actual
amount
of
dollars,
although
i
will
point
out
to
you
that
the
district
court
here
has
awarded
25%
of
the
recovery,
and
certainly
we
have
an
interesting
situation
going.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
yes,
and
he
certainly
held
there
that
--
but
he
said
he’s
not
compelled.
you
just
look
at
it
and
you
see
what
the
spirit
is.
now,
in
texas
you
don’t
get
attorney’s
fees
because
texas
law
doesn’t
do
it.
in
california
by
the
way,
private
mechanics
liens
don’t
give
rise
to
attorney’s
fees.
you
can’t
get
attorney’s
fees.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
you
don’t
get
it
under
california
law,
and
you
don’t
get
it
under
connecticut
law,
and
you
don’t
get
it
under
any
law
unless
you
have
a
statute
which
gives
it
to
you.
and
i
go
further
mr.
justice
--
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
i’m
saying
fleischmann.
why
do
we
have
to
go
see
what
the
50
states
are
doing
when
we
have
a
law
enacted
by
congress
which
tells
you
what
the
measure
of
recovery
is?
i
will
--
i
don’t
want
to
look
at
--
i
don't
want
--
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
give
towards
an
amount,
but
i
will
accept
your
suggestion.
but
i
do
think
the
statute
says
that
you
may
prosecute
said
action
to
final
execution
and
in
judgment
for
the
some
or
some
justly
do
them.
and
that’s
the
end
of
it.
that’s
precisely
the
kind
of
language
you
have
in
lanham.
now,
i
don’t
think
that
your
decision
in
the
electric
auto-lite
case
really
distinguishes
fleischmann,
because
in
that
case
you
granted
attorney’s
fees,
but
you
did
it
on
a
classical
basis
for
granting
attorney’s
fees.
there
has
also
been
--
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice?
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
no,
no,
that
face
you
always
had.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
as
the
fund.
it
was
the
one
stockholder
doing
that
which
will
be
the
benefit
of
all
of
the
stockholders,
which
the
chancellor
in
equity
has
always
been
able
to
grant
attorney’s
fees
for.
so
i
think
that
you
have
some
unfortunate
language
though
in
the
electric
auto-lite
case,
because
you
seem
to
push
fleischmann
too
far
apart.
in
fleischman
you
thought,
and
this
court
did
write
in
fleischmann
that
there
are
exceptions,
and
one
of
the
exceptions
was
the
fun
or
doing
good
for
the
public
good.
i’ve
only
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
public
accommodation
act
and
the
equal
opportunity
act
where
congress
meant
to
give
us
attorney’s
fees,
it
clearly
said
that
we
get
attorney’s
fees,
14
u.s.c.
2000a,
3b
and
14
u.s.c.,
i’m
sorry
i
don’t
have
the
other
court.
it’s
not
cited
in
the
brief,
i
apologize
for
that.
but
it
is
the
public
accommodation’s
act
and
the
equal
opportunity
act.
i’ll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
yes
i
have.
on
the
question
of
the
attorney’s
fees
raised
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
as
to
the
question
of
local
law,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
you
that
the
plaintiff
here,
the
real
plaintiff
not
the
united
states,
but
the
plaintiff
here
is
a
state
of
washington
corporation.
the
defendant
is
a
connecticut
corporation
and
the
work
that
was
performed
was
not
performed
under
any
contract
or
direct
relationship
between
the
defendant
and
the
plaintiff.
had
they
had
a
direct
contract,
and
had
we
under
the
conflicts
of
law
look
to
that
contract,
we
might
be
applying
the
law
which
we
usually
write
into
our
direct
contracts
that
this
shall
be
governed
by
connecticut
law,
or
washington
law,
or
texas
law.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
yes.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
yes,
i
understand
that,
but
i
am
not
--
but
i
am
pointing
out
to
you
that
there
is
a
vice
in
my
opinion
in
allowing
the
various
state
law.
in
texas,
you
get
attorney’s
fee
--
you
don’t
get
attorney’s
fees,
in
california,
in
alaska
that
you
do,
louisiana
you
don’t
in
florida,
etcetera.
the
other
point
on
attorney’s
fees
and
the
spirit
of
the
law,
i
would
like
to
--
there
is
a
trade
secrets
case
that
i
saw
though
this
morning,
very
interesting
one.
but
the
ninth
circuit
has
considered
this
question
in
the
trade
secret
case
in
the
midwest
co.
against
kaiser
aluminum
407
f.2d
288,
it
is
not
in
my
brief,
a
1969
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
held
against
granting
attorney’s
fees
in
a
trade
secret
case,
finding
there
was
no
compelling
public
interest.
why
there’s
a
compelling
public
interest
in
miller
act
cases
escapes
me,
i’ve
never
understood
it.
i
do
think
it
is
mr.
justice
brandeis’
words
as
re-promulgated
by
this
court
in
macevoy,
which
has
given
a
false
direction
to
the
lower
courts.
i
want
to
bring
out
the
monroe
port
case
on
the
question
of
the
subcontractor
and
the
relationship
of
cerpac.
there
is
nothing
that
was
said
by
my
learned
brother
as
to
cerpac’s
status
which
applies
to
the
plywood
which
is
here
under
consideration.
it
was
a
separate
contract
for
the
plywood.
it
was
simply
invoiced
separately
and
shipped.
in
the
monroe
port
case
and
decided
in
the
first
circuit,
you
will
recall
that
the
first
circuit
upheld
in
the
necessity
for
giving
a
90-day
notice.
even
though
the
miller
act
claimant
was
a
direct
subcontractor
of
the
plaintiff,
but
there
he
had
done
some
work
for
another
subcontractor
and
thus
he
had,
for
that
portion
of
work,
been
a
subcontractor
of
the
subcontractor.
he
was
also
a
direct
subcontractor
of
the
general
contractor,
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
in
monroe
port
held
that
he
had
to
give
the
90-day
notice.
and
i
hold
that
whatever
cerpac
may
have
been
in
relationship
to
rich
insofar
as
the
millwork,
although
i
think
he’s
still
a
materialman
there
too,
but
those
facts
are
not
before
you.
he
certainly
cannot
be
considered
to
be
a
subcontractor
for
plywood.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
involves
the
miller
act
40
u.s.c.
270b.
it
involves
a
suit
by
a
supplier
of
a
middle
party,
cerpac,
supplied
plywood
to
the
general
contractor,
the
f.d.
rich
co.
for
a
federal
project
at
the
beale
air
force
base
in
california.
the
court
and
the
district
court
found
in
favor
of
the
supplier
on
a
number
of
issues.
it
denied
attorney’s
fees
and
appeal
was
taken
by
the
rich
co.
and
industrial
lumber
took
a
cross-appeal.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court
on
as
to
the
denial
of
attorney’s
fees,
and
also
reversed
on
an
interest
question
as
to
whether
7%
or
8%
interest
should
be
granted
under
california
law,
and
affirmed
on
all
other
issues
against
--
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
no,
your
honor,
i
think
it
will
--
i
am
not
prepared
to
argue
that.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
i
think
we
briefed
it
shortly.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
we
briefed
it,
i’m
not
abandoning
in
it
but
it
do
have
three
other
issues
that
i
would
like
to
argue
that
i
think
are
more
--
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
i
am
sorry.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
if
that
is
true.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
and
the
90-day,
the
standard.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
yes,
the
standard
of
the
90
days.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
i
think
that
is
true
and
i
do
believe
that
there
has
been
an
inadvertent
violation
of
your
rules,
if
it
is
so
then
i
stand
correct
and
i
will
--
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
i
did
not
intend
to
argue
them
in
any
event,
and
i
will
abide
by
the
court’s
rules
on
the
matter.
i
apologize
for
the
oversight.
the
plaintiff
below,
the
contract
involved
here,
was
cerpac
and
industrial,
and
cerpac
and
rich.
rich
being
the
general
contractor,
cerpac
being
the
supplier,
and
industrial
being
supplier,
was
for
standard
manufactured
plywood
and
a
simple
contract
for
the
furnishing
of
that
plywood
was
given
from
rich
to
cerpac,
and
in
turn
from
cerpac
to
industrial,
and
industrial
caused
the
material,
plywood,
to
be
shipped
directly
to
rich’s
job
at
the
beale
air
force
base
in
california.
what
happened
was
that
during
the
course
of
the
job,
that’s
toward
the
end
of
it,
cerpac
became
in
financial
trouble
went
bankrupt
despite
the
payments
from
rich
to
with,
and
industrial
is
now
sought
to
bring
a
miller
act
suit
seeking
to
collect
for
the
plywood.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
ninth
circuit
has
adverted
to
the
fact
that
cerpac
was
an
important
member
and
subcontractor
of
the
rich
co.,
relying
on
the
fact
that
not
only
that
cerpac
have
a
contract
to
supply
plywood,
but
it
also
had
a
separate
contract
to
supply
millwork.
the
millwork
issue
was
not
at
all
in
the
case.
in
this
case,
it
was
only
introduced
and
used
in
this
case
to
point
out
that
cerpac
was
an
important
supplier
and/or
“subcontractor
of
the
f.d.
rich
co.”
the
fact
is,
however,
that
in
this
particular
case,
industrial
supplied
plywood
to
cerpac
who
in
turn
supplied
the
same
plywood
to
rich.
it
would
seem
to
be
that
at
least
since
the
macevoy
decision
in
322
u.s.,
that
relationship
can
give
rise
to
nothing
but
a
materialman,
and
a
supplier
of
a
materialman
under
the
miller
act
has
long
been
understood
to
be
too
far
to
receive
any
relief
under
the
miller
act.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
yes.
anyone
having
a
direct
contract
with
the
general
contractor
under
270b
(a),
a
direct
contract
does
not
have
to
give
notice
and
after
90
days
of
not
being
paid
may
bring
a
suit
against
the
principal,
which
is
the
general
contractor
and
at
surety
here,
transamerica.
and
that’s
whether
he
be
a
materialman
or
a
subcontractor
and
it
is
unimportant,
which
he
is.
however,
if
you
do
not
have
a
direct
contract
with
the
general
contractor,
you
can
still
get
relief
under
the
miller
act
bond
if
you
have
a
contract
with
the
subcontractor,
and
that
goes
from
the
language
as
interpreted
by
this
court
in
macevoy
against
united
states,
322
u.s.
102,
i
believe.
and
it
really
talks
about
the
language
in
the
case,
which
states
that
in
the
proviso
that
any
person
having
a
direct
contractual
relationship
with
the
subcontractor
but
no
contractual
relationship
express
or
implied
with
the
contractor,
that
is
the
general
contractor,
furnishing
said
payment
bond
shall
give
notice
and
then
goes
on
to
say
he
has
a
right
of
action.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
in
bringing
in
what
was
a
really
of
strenuous
matter
is
the
fact
that,
there
was
a
contract
between
rich
and
cerpac,
under
which
cerpac
supplied
no
work.
by
the
way,
the
court
and
it’s
not
borne
out
by
anything
in
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
the
court
held
that
cerpac
installed
the
millwork,
but
that
is
completely
untrue
and
it
is
not
adverted
to
in
the
brief
for
the
respondent.
well,
be
that
as
it
may,
we
suggest
to
you
that
the
proper
test
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
cerpac
was
a
materialman
or
a
subcontractor,
is
the
test
set
forth
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
aetna
casualty
co.
against
gibson
steel
co.,
382
f.2d
615,
in
that
case
the
supplier
or
the
middle
man
was
a
metal
supplied
steel
and
iron
products,
and
if
fact
customized
some
of
the
products.
he
made
ladders
and
deck
plates,
and
switch
plates,
and
various
steel
and
iron
products
costumed
for
the
particular
government
contract
and
supplied
them,
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
there
that
he
was
a
materialman.
the
virtue
of
adopting
the
gibson
steel
approach
is
that
we
don’t
have
to
get
into
this
almost
future
interest
type
of
discussion
of
the
law.
a
man
is
either
a
subcontractor
or
a
materialman,
and
in
the
macevoy
case,
this
court
held
that
if
he
takes
over
and
is
important
and
does
a
lot
of
the
work,
he
may
become
a
subcontractor,
but
if
he
is
one
that
merely
supplies
material,
he
is
a
materialman.
the
respondent
has
ceased
in
his
brief
on
the
fact
that
during
a
deposition,
one
of
the
officers
of
the
f.d.
rich
co.
stated
that
cerpac
was
a
subcontractor
for
the
plywood.
i
only
point
out
to
you
that
this
court
in
322
u.s.
in
the
macevoy
case
in
footnote
4
also
stated
that
any
use
by
the
court
previous
to
that
time
of
the
loose
use
of
the
word
“subcontractor
materialman”
by
the
supreme
court
would
not
be
binding
on
it.
i
ask
the
court
to
view
this
in
the
--
that
it
is
unimportant
as
to
what
mr.
rich
who
was
giving
the
deposition
happened
to
call
cerpac.
what
is
important
is
an
examination
of
what
the
function
he
did,
and
not
what
his
relationship
was
but
the
function
that
he
performed.
and
his
function
was
to
supply
plywood
which
he
bought
from
industrial,
so,
therefore
as
a
materialman
of
the
materialman,
and
clearly
interdicted
by
the
macevoy
case.
now,
another
question
of
that
venue
and
then
i
want
to
come
to
the
attorney’s
fees
question,
which
is
of
great
interest.
on
the
question
of
venue,
the
statute
very
clearly
says
270
--
40
u.s.c.
270b
(b),
every
suit
instituted
under
this
section
shall
be
brought
in
the
name
of
the
united
states
etcetera,
in
the
unites
states
district
court
for
any
district
in
which
the
court
was
to
be
performed
and
executed,
and
not
elsewhere.
now,
starting
with
the
language
in
justice
brandeis'
language
in
illinois
surety
co.
against
the
john
davis
co.
which
this
court
then
in
a
dictum
used
in
the
macevoy
case
at
322
u.s.
in
which
you
said
that
this
miller
act
is
a
remedial
statute
and
you
ought
to
liberally
construe
it.
the
lower
courts
have
absolutely
gone
wild
and
they’ve
liberally
construed
it
so
that
they
forgotten
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
they
have
forgotten
the
ratio
decidendi
of
the
macevoy
case.
the
macevoy
case,
you
clearly
stated
that
even
though
it
has
to
be
liberally
construed,
there
is
no
way
to
impose
liability
on
a
materialman
or
a
materialman
claim
words
of
the
statute
may
not
be
disregarded.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
does
not
believe
the
ratio
decidendi
of
the
macevoy
case
and
it
has
stated
that
even
though
two
of
the
shipments
involved
here
were
sent
by
industrial
to
south
carolina
for
a
different
contract,
different
federal
contract
on
which
there
was
a
different
surety
that
venue
could
be
had
in
the
district
court
for
california
for
recovery
of
those
two
shipments.
the
court
however
realized
that
it
was
kind
of
embarrassing
since
transamerica
insurance
co.
was
not
the
surety
for
the
south
carolina
job.
[laughter
attempt]
so
it
said
“alright,
we’re
holding
that
the
principle
under
the
beale
bond,
i.e.
the
general
contractor
f.d.
rich
co.
is
liable,
but
we’re
excusing
transamerica.”
well,
you
know
the
bond
is
only
one
instrument
where
either
you
can’t
be
a
little
bit
pregnant
about
this
whether
liable
or
were
not
liable.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
yes,
sir.
there
were
two
different
federal
jobs.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
no
question
mr.
justice
blackmun.
and
in
the
court,
i
really
don’t
understand
the
court,
because
it’s
a
circuit
which
i
have
often
admired
and
i
just
didn’t
understand
their
decision
here
on
that
issue
of
saying
that
the
south
carolina
shipments
for
a
different
job
was
somehow
cognizable
under
the
district
court
here.
judge
wollenberg
in
the
roscoe
case
--
judge
wollenberg
in
u.s.
against
roscoe
ajax
in
246
f.
supp.
439
has
set
down
a
splendid
exposition
of
the
venue
statute,
and
he
has
said
that
the
venue
statute
is
jurisdictional
and
cannot
be
disregarded
by
the
courts.
in
other
words,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
which
says
“and
not
elsewhere”
must
be
enforced.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
but
this,
you
know,
this
is
semantic
problem.
it
is
a
semantic
problem.
the
congress
of
the
united
states
did
not
use
the
word
“venue.”
the
congress
of
the
united
states
said
that
anybody
who
wants
to
sue
under
the
miller
act
must
sue
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
any
district
in
which
the
contract
was
to
be
performed
and
executed
and
not
elsewhere.
we,
lawyers
and
we
lower
courts,
and
hopefully
not
the
supreme
court,
have
introduced
concepts
of
venue
and
jurisdiction.
i
agree
with
you.
judge
wollenberg
agrees
with
you.
he
says
that
it
is
not
a
venue
problem;
it's
a
jurisdictional
problem
and
cannot
be
waived.
in
that
case,
he
refused
to
allow
two
parties
to
change
the
venue
that
they
had
in
a
private
contract.
you
considered
this
question
in
passing
in
the
moseley
case.
in
moseley,
you
considered
it
on
the
question
where
the
contract
had
an
arbitration
clause
and
you
considered
the
effect
of
arbitration,
united
states
arbitration
statute,
on
the
miller
act
and
on
this
jurisdictional
point.
and
there
you
send
it
back
and
it
was
inconclusive
and
never
decided
because
there
was
a
question
of
fraud
and
you
held
that
it
should
go
back
to
the
district
court,
but
in
a
concurring
opinion,
i
think
it
was
concurring,
the
chief
justice
warren
pointed
out
that
there
were
problems
and
judge
wollenberg
has
dealt
with
that
issue
in
the
roscoe
ajax
case.
the
most
fascinating
part
of
the
court
of
appeals’
decision,
aside
from
this
venue
question
on
which
i
submit
they
are
clearly
wrong,
and
on
the
question
of
the
materialman,
is
the
court’s
action
on
attorney’s
fees.
the
attorney
fee
question
has
been
plaguing
the
lower
courts
and
lawyers
who
represent
surety
companies
as
well
as
contractors
for
the
last
10
or
15
years.
for
a
time
there,
nobody
even
thought
that
to
ask
for
attorney’s
fees,
and
then
suddenly
lawyers
are
starting
to
ask
and,
lo
and
behold,
federal
courts
are
beginning
to
grant
attorney’s
fees,
this
court
held
in
the
fleischmann
case,
fleischmann
against
maier
involving
the
lanham
act
that
only
congress,
at
least
in
our
courts,
gives
attorney’s
fees,
and
it’s
pointed
out
that
this
has
been
that
in
american
jurisprudence,
attorney’s
fees
are
not
granted
absent
a
specific
statute
or
a
contract
which
provides
for
them.
in
that
case
the
lanham
act,
you
held
that
the
lanham
act
set
forth
the
remedies,
and
therefore
that
was
the
end
of
it
and
attorney’s
fees
could
not
be
granted
regardless
of
the
public
policy
to
encourage
actions
under
lanham
act
or
not.
in
the
miller
act,
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
has
held
relying
on
the
red
top
metal,
inc.
case,
the
fifth
circuit
case
and
relying
on
the
broad
language
of
mr.
justice
brandeis’
decision
in
the
illinois
surety
co.
case
that
attorney’s
fees
should
be
awarded.
and
this
is
a
curious
situation,
a
curious
result.
the
appellate,
intermediate
appellate
court
in
california
in
the
richter
case
quoted
in
the
opinion
of
the
appellate
court
has
held
that
--
had
held
in
another
type
of
bond,
not
a
miller
act
bond
that
the
california
law
had
no
application
to
a
private
construction
projects
or
to
projects
of
the
united
states.
the
lower
court
followed
that
case,
and
the
appellate
court
reversed
and
approved
judge
macbride,
the
chief
judge
of
the
eastern
district
of
california’s
decision,
which
is
cited
in
the
opinion.
the
court
approved
this
language
and
it
held
that
federal
law
and
hedl
that
under
the
policy
of
california
law,
not
its
letter,
attorney’s
fees
were
recoverable
and
miller
act
cases
to
be
taxed
as
costs.
now,
this
situation
was
foresaw
by
the
red
top
metal’s
case
in
which
judge
wisdom
in
a
very
well
written
decision
with
an
erroneous
result
in
the
fifth
circuit
has
reasoned
through
this
whole
question
of
the
attorney’s
fees.
he
reasoned
and
he
said
“well
no,
you
can’t
look
to
state
statute
law,
because
the
states
aren’t
legislating
for
congress,
and
it
really
is
a
federal
question.”
but
he
found
that
the
miller
act
had
a
hiatus
and
we
look
to
the
state
law
to
fill
in
the
hiati,
if
that
is
the
plural
or
the
hiatuses.
he
really
did
something
that
this
court
seems
to
have
done
in
the
electric
auto-lite
case
involving
the
section
14
(a)
of
the
security
act
of
1934.
in
that
case
if
you
recall,
in
finding
that
there
was
a
private
remedy
under
section
14
(a),
this
court
also
held
that
you
could
award
attorney’s
fees.
and
it
held
that
it
had
a
right
to
do
so
because
congress
had
left
to
you
the
question
of
interpretation
of
whether
there
is
a
private
remedy
under
section
14
(a)
and
therefore,
you
could
write
the
entire
remedy
including
the
attorney’s
fees.
and
you
distinguished
the
fleischmann
case
in
which
would
clearly
lay
down
a
very
clear
line
of
law
saying
that
where
there’s
a
federal
statute
involved
and
the
statute
doesn’t
involve
attorney’s
fees,
the
lower
courts
are
not
to
grant
them.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
yes,
but
that
is
an
interpretation
by
a
state
court
of
a
state
law.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
and
literally
--
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
well,
i
think
i
have
the
fleischmann
case
that
this
court
decided
in
our
favor,
because
i
think
the
remedy
under
the
miller
act
which
says
exactly
what
the
subcontractor,
a
materialman
is
to
recover
is
identical
with
the
remedy
set
forth
in
the
lanham
act.
and
you
have
interpreted
the
lanham
act
that
way
and
you
ought
to
interpret
the
miller
act
that
way,
and
we
ought
not
to
get
into
constant
litigation
as
to
whether
or
not
something
which
is
clearly
decided
by
the
supreme
court
is
to
be
eroded
now.
we
must
have
40
cases
now
on
attorneys,
and
some
circuits
give
them
and
in
texas,
a
federal
contractor
--
now
in
texas,
you
don’t
have
to
pay
attorney’s
fees
if
you
lose
--
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
as
an
old
member
of
the
department
of
justice
and
an
associate
of
mr.
freidman,
i
would
hope
to
win
on
a
broader
issue,
but
i
wouldn’t
like
to
win
on
anything.
i
do
think
the
issue
was
more
important
than
the
actual
amount
of
dollars,
although
i
will
point
out
to
you
that
the
district
court
here
has
awarded
25%
of
the
recovery,
and
certainly
we
have
an
interesting
situation
going.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
yes,
and
he
certainly
held
there
that
--
but
he
said
he’s
not
compelled.
you
just
look
at
it
and
you
see
what
the
spirit
is.
now,
in
texas
you
don’t
get
attorney’s
fees
because
texas
law
doesn’t
do
it.
in
california
by
the
way,
private
mechanics
liens
don’t
give
rise
to
attorney’s
fees.
you
can’t
get
attorney’s
fees.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
you
don’t
get
it
under
california
law,
and
you
don’t
get
it
under
connecticut
law,
and
you
don’t
get
it
under
any
law
unless
you
have
a
statute
which
gives
it
to
you.
and
i
go
further
mr.
justice
--
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
i’m
saying
fleischmann.
why
do
we
have
to
go
see
what
the
50
states
are
doing
when
we
have
a
law
enacted
by
congress
which
tells
you
what
the
measure
of
recovery
is?
i
will
--
i
don’t
want
to
look
at
--
i
don't
want
--
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
give
towards
an
amount,
but
i
will
accept
your
suggestion.
but
i
do
think
the
statute
says
that
you
may
prosecute
said
action
to
final
execution
and
in
judgment
for
the
some
or
some
justly
do
them.
and
that’s
the
end
of
it.
that’s
precisely
the
kind
of
language
you
have
in
lanham.
now,
i
don’t
think
that
your
decision
in
the
electric
auto-lite
case
really
distinguishes
fleischmann,
because
in
that
case
you
granted
attorney’s
fees,
but
you
did
it
on
a
classical
basis
for
granting
attorney’s
fees.
there
has
also
been
--
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice?
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
no,
no,
that
face
you
always
had.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
as
the
fund.
it
was
the
one
stockholder
doing
that
which
will
be
the
benefit
of
all
of
the
stockholders,
which
the
chancellor
in
equity
has
always
been
able
to
grant
attorney’s
fees
for.
so
i
think
that
you
have
some
unfortunate
language
though
in
the
electric
auto-lite
case,
because
you
seem
to
push
fleischmann
too
far
apart.
in
fleischman
you
thought,
and
this
court
did
write
in
fleischmann
that
there
are
exceptions,
and
one
of
the
exceptions
was
the
fun
or
doing
good
for
the
public
good.
i’ve
only
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
in
the
public
accommodation
act
and
the
equal
opportunity
act
where
congress
meant
to
give
us
attorney’s
fees,
it
clearly
said
that
we
get
attorney’s
fees,
14
u.s.c.
2000a,
3b
and
14
u.s.c.,
i’m
sorry
i
don’t
have
the
other
court.
it’s
not
cited
in
the
brief,
i
apologize
for
that.
but
it
is
the
public
accommodation’s
act
and
the
equal
opportunity
act.
i’ll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
yes
i
have.
on
the
question
of
the
attorney’s
fees
raised
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist
as
to
the
question
of
local
law,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
you
that
the
plaintiff
here,
the
real
plaintiff
not
the
united
states,
but
the
plaintiff
here
is
a
state
of
washington
corporation.
the
defendant
is
a
connecticut
corporation
and
the
work
that
was
performed
was
not
performed
under
any
contract
or
direct
relationship
between
the
defendant
and
the
plaintiff.
had
they
had
a
direct
contract,
and
had
we
under
the
conflicts
of
law
look
to
that
contract,
we
might
be
applying
the
law
which
we
usually
write
into
our
direct
contracts
that
this
shall
be
governed
by
connecticut
law,
or
washington
law,
or
texas
law.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
yes.
mr.
lawrence
gochberg
yes,
i
understand
that,
but
i
am
not
--
but
i
am
pointing
out
to
you
that
there
is
a
vice
in
my
opinion
in
allowing
the
various
state
law.
in
texas,
you
get
attorney’s
fee
--
you
don’t
get
attorney’s
fees,
in
california,
in
alaska
that
you
do,
louisiana
you
don’t
in
florida,
etcetera.
the
other
point
on
attorney’s
fees
and
the
spirit
of
the
law,
i
would
like
to
--
there
is
a
trade
secrets
case
that
i
saw
though
this
morning,
very
interesting
one.
but
the
ninth
circuit
has
considered
this
question
in
the
trade
secret
case
in
the
midwest
co.
against
kaiser
aluminum
407
f.2d
288,
it
is
not
in
my
brief,
a
1969
case
where
the
court
of
appeals
held
against
granting
attorney’s
fees
in
a
trade
secret
case,
finding
there
was
no
compelling
public
interest.
why
there’s
a
compelling
public
interest
in
miller
act
cases
escapes
me,
i’ve
never
understood
it.
i
do
think
it
is
mr.
justice
brandeis’
words
as
re-promulgated
by
this
court
in
macevoy,
which
has
given
a
false
direction
to
the
lower
courts.
i
want
to
bring
out
the
monroe
port
case
on
the
question
of
the
subcontractor
and
the
relationship
of
cerpac.
there
is
nothing
that
was
said
by
my
learned
brother
as
to
cerpac’s
status
which
applies
to
the
plywood
which
is
here
under
consideration.
it
was
a
separate
contract
for
the
plywood.
it
was
simply
invoiced
separately
and
shipped.
in
the
monroe
port
case
and
decided
in
the
first
circuit,
you
will
recall
that
the
first
circuit
upheld
in
the
necessity
for
giving
a
90-day
notice.
even
though
the
miller
act
claimant
was
a
direct
subcontractor
of
the
plaintiff,
but
there
he
had
done
some
work
for
another
subcontractor
and
thus
he
had,
for
that
portion
of
work,
been
a
subcontractor
of
the
subcontractor.
he
was
also
a
direct
subcontractor
of
the
general
contractor,
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
in
monroe
port
held
that
he
had
to
give
the
90-day
notice.
and
i
hold
that
whatever
cerpac
may
have
been
in
relationship
to
rich
insofar
as
the
millwork,
although
i
think
he’s
still
a
materialman
there
too,
but
those
facts
are
not
before
you.
he
certainly
cannot
be
considered
to
be
a
subcontractor
for
plywood.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
