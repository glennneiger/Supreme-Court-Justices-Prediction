as
required

a

bond,
then
led
two
contracts
on
the
project
through
cerpac

one
being
to
select,
detail
and
install
custom
millwork;
and
the
other
to
supply
standard
plywood
for
the
project.
to
satisfy
the
plywood
project,
cerpac
purchased
the

one
shipment

the

a
judgment
for
the
respondent
and
the
amount
due
on
the
unpaid

but
denied

the
court
of

affirmed
in

other
relevant
respects,
held
that

have
been
awarded
the

as
a
successful
miller
act
complainer.
