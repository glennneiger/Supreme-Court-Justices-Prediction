mr.
dennis
s.
harlowe
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
pick
up
where
counsel
left
off,
namely
with
the
attorney
fee
question
and
first
apologize
for
an
oversight
in
my
brief.
i
think
i
should
have
updated
the
california
code
for
the
benefit
of
the
court.
the
government
code
section
on
attorney’s
fees
that
has
been
referred
to
as
this
case
has
come
forward
is
the
government
code
section
4207
by
the
1970
statutes
of
california
effective
january
1,
1971.
in
that
code
section
you
will
find
today
is
civil
code
section
3250.
it
was
at
this
point
that
the
california
legislature
brought
together
its
government
and
civil
code
as
it
pertained
to
mechanics
liens.
and
i
think
at
this
point,
it
would
be
appropriate
to
hearken
back
to
the
type
of
question
that
justice
rehnquist
raised
and
that
is,
in
california
or
perhaps
it
was
justice
blackmun
and
that
is
in
california
“do
you
not
get
attorney’s
fees
because
the
appellate
court
of
california
says
you
do
not
get
them?”
and
our
answer
to
that
of
course
is,
“no,
the
intermediate
appellate
court
in
california
in
dicta
made
the
comment
that
attorney’s
fees
under
their
civil
code
statute
do
not
apply.”
that
statute
does
not
apply
to
a
project
of
the
united
states.
that
type
of
contention
was
first
overcome
in
our
view
in
chevron
asphalt,
the
decision
by
judge
macbride
cited
in
our
brief,
when
he
points
out
that
certainly
that
this
court
could
not
be
expected
to
look
to
a
california
statute
to
determine
what
the
remedy
is
that’s
afforded
by
congress
in
a
federal
statute.
what
is
the
remedy
that’s
afforded
a
claimant
on
the
miller
act
bond
under
the
federal
statute?
mr.
dennis
s.
harlowe
no,
your
honor,
i
think
all
that
we’re
saying
and
all
that
the
chevron
asphalt
case
has
said,
and
all
that
the
ninth
circuit
in
our
case
has
said
is
that
case
did
not
make
such
a
decision.
it
has
not
for
miller
act
purposes
determined
what
“state
law”
is
particularly
when
state
law
states
at
this
section
3250,
the
current
point,
that
in
any
action
the
court
shall
award
to
the
prevailing
party
of
reasonable
attorney’s
fee
to
be
taxed
as
cost.
the
troublesome
angle
in
chevron
asphalt
was
that
the
california
legislature
had
seemed
fit
to
make
a
distinction
in
its
statutory
scheme
between
a
state
government
and
a
private
state
project.
therefore,
in
both
chevron
asphalt
and
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
our
case
they
said
“look,
we
have
a
government
project,
california
on
a
government
project
awards
attorney’s
fees.
we
are
going
to
do
so.”
and
that’s
kind
of
a
way
to
back
in
to
the
point
i
want
to
make.
this
court
is
not
being
asked
to
affirm
a
judgment
which
says
“you
are
entitled
to
attorney’s
fees
in
a
miller
act
case”
that
isn’t
the
point.
the
point
is,
this
court
is
being
asked
to
affirm
a
judgment
which
says
“look
to
state
law
to
make
that
determination”,
why
is
that
type
of
judgment
necessary?
because
the
miller
act
does
not
provide
the
remedy,
as
my
learned
opponent
has
set
forth,
he
would
believe
that
the
miller
act
somehow
tells
you
what
the
nature
of
the
recovery
should
be.
we
submit
that
it
does
not.
it
says
“you
shall
receive
the
sums
justly
do.”
contrast
that
with
maier-fleischmann.
under
the
lanham
act,
you’re
entitled
to
all
sorts
of
a
detailed
remedy.
you
get
the
defendant’s
profits
for
example,
plus
your
damages,
plus
there’s
an
elaborate
provision
whereby
discretion
in
the
district
judge
can
increase
or
decrease
the
amount
of
the
award.
it’s
a
very
detailed
remedy
and
as
pointed
out
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
decision,
in
that
instance
when
congress
has
taken
the
pains
to
detail
exactly
what’s
going
to
happen,
you
should
not
imply
another
remedy.
i
think
there’s
another
reason
for
it,
and
that
in
a
sense
is
a
pure
federal
situation.
its
trademark
law
and
what
is
the
consequence
of
a
violation.
that
isn’t
our
case
here.
if
this
court
or
any
court
were
to
say
“you
get
attorney’s
fees”
well,
i
guess
this
court
is
the
only
one
who
could
to
do,
we’re
to
say
you
get
attorney’s
fees
in
the
miller
act
case
that
would
be
unfair
in
states
that
don’t
award
miller
act
cases
on
state
projects.
mr.
dennis
s.
harlowe
because
there
is
no
other
way
your
honor,
to
define
what
type
of
recovery
is
intended
in
a
miller
act
case.
it’s
at
this
point
that
ninth
circuit
in
our
case
and
in
red
top
metals
in
an
even
more
definitive
statement
i
think,
in
usf&g
versus
henry,
a
florida
case
that
the
courts
all
say
“well,
let’s
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
act.”
and
at
that
point
they
look
at
illinois
surety
versus
john
davis
in
the
language
of
justice
brandeis
where
he
points
out
the
miller
act
was
intended
to
be
in
lieu
of
the
lien
customary
on
private
property,
customary
lien.
mr.
dennis
s.
harlowe
yes,
you
do.
mr.
dennis
s.
harlowe
oh!
excuse
me.
yes.
prior
to
the
time
that
the
government
code
section
was
extracted
and
put
in
to
the
civil
code,
that
would
have
been
the
case.
mr.
dennis
s.
harlowe
now,
you
get
them
in
both
sides.
mr.
dennis
s.
harlowe
yes.
including
you
will
notice
in
that
same
section
i
cited
you
that
is
3250,
they
have
a
nice
thing
in
california.
they
provide
you
with
some
of
the
legislative
notes.
and
i
think
i
should
mention
is
that
the
legislative
note
to
3250
points
out
that
it
is
the
intent
of
the
legislature
by
this
act
to
change
the
basis
for
a
decision
of
law
denying
attorney’s
fees
on
appeal,
so
as
to
permit
prevailing
party
to
recover
such
fees
on
appeal.
it
is
that
type
of
statute,
that
type
of
statutory
determination
by
the
legislature
of
the
form
of
state
that
clearly
expresses
the
policy
of
that
state
that
the
businessman
in
that
state
expect
to
do
business
under
within
the
boundaries
of
that
state.
and
the
only
thing
that
we’re
suggesting
is
that
the
miller
act
was
intended
to
replace
that
not
to
unfairly
benefit
federal
government
projects.
mr.
dennis
s.
harlowe
yes,
your
honor
the
one
point
that
we
made
there
that
did
not
prevail
in
the
court
of
appeals,
perhaps
i
shouldn’t
say
not
prevail,
you
notice
on
a
footnote
in
their
decision
they
say
that
we
urged
at
that
time
that
it
should
be
made
retroactive
if
that’s
necessary.
and
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
said
“no,
we’re
not
even
going
to
enter
into
a
retroactivity
type
of
question.”
because
they
felt
that
was
not
necessary.
they
took
the
same
position
that
judge
macbride
took
in
chevron
asphalt,
namely
if
you
get
it
on
a
state
government
project,
you
get
it
on
a
federal
government
project.
and
we’re
not
going
to
concern
ourselves
and
as
judge
macbride
points
out
he
says
“i
don’t
know
why
california
wants
to
make
a
distinction
like
that?”
and
as
it
turned
the
state
legislature
of
california
subsequently
agreed
with
him,
so
even
prior
to
the
time
of
the
judgment
on
remand
in
this
case,
we
have
that
combination
where
attorney’s
fees
are
available
in
both
sides
of
the
case.
without
cutting
this
too
short,
i
would
like
to
make
an
observation
on
the
argument
urged
by
my
opponent
in
connection
with
the
status
of
cerpac
as
a
contractor.
i
think
the
facts
are
exhaustively
presented
in
the
findings
and
conclusions.
the
reason
for
that
was
this
case
was
tried
as
a
companion
to
a
prior
case
with
similar
parties
involved
and
it
was
possible
to
do
it
largely
by
stipulation
in
the
record,
and
we
wanted
to
set
out
at
that
point
what
it
was
that
the
documentation
showed,
and
a
few
of
the
factors
that
should
be
rehearsed
are
the
very
ones
that
counsel
has
emphasized
in
the
aetna
case
is
showing
the
contrary.
and
that
is
in
this
case,
we’ve
got
a
contractor
who
worked
under
a
contract
agreement,
received
progress
payments
for
specific
and
substantial
sections
of
the
work
at
a
fixed
price
with
progress
payments
in
a
continuing
relationship
and
guaranteed
against
defects
and
workmanship
in
material.
all
of
which,
in
addition
to
a
vast
number
of
other
details
of
the
relationship
that
are
set
forth
in
our
brief,
without
question,
show
that
cerpac
is
a
contract
--
subcontractor.
going
behind
that
however,
is
the
finding
of
the
district
court.
again,
one
that
was
not
necessary
to
the
decision
at
the
ninth
circuit,
and
that
finding
was
that
there
was
a
direct
implied
relationship
between
rich
and
industrial.
and
that
relationship
had
its
germination.
you
can
go
back
to
the
findings
of
the
trial
judge
as
early
as
may,
and
during
the
course
of
their
relationship
in
1966,
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
the
parties
at
that
time
what
it
was
they
wanted
the
contract
for,
what
each
party
was
expecting
to
have
done.
unfortunately,
our
client
fulfilled
his
half
of
it
and
did
not
get
paid.
that
was
the
implied
contract.
that
was
the
meeting
of
the
minds
that
the
district
judge
found
that
the
ninth
circuit
courts
did
not
rely
upon.
it
could
not
say
those
findings
were
clearly
erroneous.
it
simply
found
that
it
had
another
issue
to
meet,
and
that
is
the
one
of
the
subcontractor
status.
and
the
reason
that
question
came
up
was
principally
so
our
opponents
at
that
time
could
argue
they
had
not
have
timely
notice
of
our
claim,
when
the
essence
of
it
was
they
had
had
notice
far
prior
to
the
time
they
get
into
conceding
to
us
that
they
owe
us
for
the
last
two
shipments.
as
far
as
the
venue
question
is
concerned
urged
here
as
being
jurisdictional,
i
think
the
authority
set
forth
in
our
brief
adequately
handle
that.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
bonding
company
with
miller
act
coverage
on
this
project
correctly
we
believe
by
the
ninth
circuit,
was
not
subjected
to
liability
for
the
shipments
to
south
carolina.
the
prime
contractor
was
we
feel
that
was
correctly
done.
and
i
think
that
would
be
adequate
for
us.
thank
you.
mr.
dennis
s.
harlowe
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should

to

up
where

namely
with
the

question
and
first

for
an

in
my

i
think
i
should
have
updated
the
california
code
for
the
benefit
of
the
court.
the
government
code
section
on
attorney’s
fees
that
has
been
referred
to
as
this
case
has
come
forward
is
the
government
code
section
4207
by
the
1970
statutes
of
california
effective
january
1,
1971.
in
that
code
section
you
will
find
today
is
civil
code
section
3250.
it
was
at
this
point
that
the
california
legislature
brought
together
its
government

civil

and
i

and
our
answer
to
that
of

is,
“no,

that

of
the
united

that
type
of
contention
was
first
overcome
in
our
view
in
chevron
asphalt,
the
decision
by
judge
macbride
cited
in
our

when

points

that
certainly
that

what
is
the
remedy
that’s
afforded
a
claimant
on
the
miller
act
bond
under
the
federal

mr.
dennis
s.
harlowe
no,
your
honor,
i
think
all
that
we’re
saying
and
all
that
the
chevron
asphalt
case
has
said,
and
all
that

particularly
when

the
current

fit
to

therefore,
in
both
chevron
asphalt
and
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
our
case
they
said
“look,
we
have
a
government
project,
california
on
a
government
project
awards
attorney’s
fees.
we
are
going
to
do
so.”
and
that’s
kind
of
a
way
to
back
in
to
the
point
i
want
to
make.
this

the
point
is,
this
court
is
being
asked
to
affirm
a
judgment
which
says
“look

to
make

determination”,
why
is
that

mr.

because
there
is
no

of

is

private
property,
customary
lien.
mr.
dennis
s.
harlowe
yes,
you
do.
mr.
dennis
s.
harlowe
oh!
excuse
me.
yes.
prior
to
the
time
that
the
government
code
section
was
extracted
and
put
in
to
the
civil
code,
that
would
have
been
the
case.
mr.
dennis
s.
harlowe
now,
you
get
them
in
both
sides.
mr.
dennis
s.
harlowe
yes.
including
you
will
notice
in
that
same
section
i
cited
you
that
is
3250,
they
have
a
nice
thing
in
california.
they
provide
you
with
some
of
the
legislative
notes.
and
i
think
i
should
mention
is
that
the
legislative
note
to
3250
points
out
that
it
is
the
intent
of
the
legislature
by
this
act
to
change
the
basis
for
a
decision
of
law
denying
attorney’s
fees
on
appeal,
so
as
to
permit
prevailing
party
to
recover
such
fees
on
appeal.
it
is
that
type
of
statute,
that
type
of
statutory
determination
by
the
legislature
of
the
form
of
state
that
clearly
expresses
the
policy
of
that
state
that
the
businessman
in
that
state
expect
to
do
business
under
within
the
boundaries
of
that
state.
and
the
only
thing
that
we’re
suggesting
is
that
the
miller
act
was
intended
to
replace
that
not
to
unfairly
benefit
federal
government
projects.
mr.
dennis
s.
harlowe
yes,
your
honor
the
one
point
that
we
made
there
that
did
not
prevail
in
the
court
of
appeals,
perhaps
i
shouldn’t
say
not
prevail,
you
notice
on
a
footnote
in
their
decision
they
say
that
we
urged
at
that
time
that
it
should
be
made
retroactive
if
that’s
necessary.
and
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
said
“no,
we’re
not
even
going
to
enter
into
a
retroactivity
type
of
question.”
because
they
felt
that
was
not
necessary.
they
took
the
same
position
that
judge
macbride
took
in
chevron
asphalt,
namely
if
you
get
it
on
a
state
government
project,
you
get
it
on
a
federal
government
project.
and
we’re
not
going
to
concern
ourselves
and
as
judge
macbride
points
out
he
says
“i
don’t
know
why
california
wants
to
make
a
distinction
like
that?”
and
as
it
turned
the
state
legislature
of
california
subsequently
agreed
with
him,
so
even
prior
to
the
time
of
the
judgment
on
remand
in
this
case,
we
have
that
combination
where
attorney’s
fees
are
available
in
both
sides
of
the
case.
without
cutting
this
too
short,
i
would
like
to
make
an
observation
on
the
argument
urged
by
my
opponent
in
connection
with
the
status
of
cerpac
as
a
contractor.
i
think
the
facts
are
exhaustively
presented
in
the
findings
and
conclusions.
the
reason
for
that
was
this
case
was
tried
as
a
companion
to
a
prior
case
with
similar
parties
involved
and
it
was
possible
to
do
it
largely
by
stipulation
in
the
record,
and
we
wanted
to
set
out
at
that
point
what
it
was
that
the
documentation
showed,
and
a
few
of
the
factors
that
should
be
rehearsed
are
the
very
ones
that
counsel
has
emphasized
in
the
aetna
case
is
showing
the
contrary.
and
that
is
in
this
case,
we’ve
got
a
contractor
who
worked
under
a
contract
agreement,
received
progress
payments
for
specific
and
substantial
sections
of
the
work
at
a
fixed
price
with
progress
payments
in
a
continuing
relationship
and
guaranteed
against
defects
and
workmanship
in
material.
all
of
which,
in
addition
to
a
vast
number
of
other
details
of
the
relationship
that
are
set
forth
in
our
brief,
without
question,
show
that
cerpac
is
a
contract
--
subcontractor.
going
behind
that
however,
is
the
finding
of
the
district
court.
again,
one
that
was
not
necessary
to
the
decision
at
the
ninth
circuit,
and
that
finding
was
that
there
was
a
direct
implied
relationship
between
rich
and
industrial.
and
that
relationship
had
its
germination.
you
can
go
back
to
the
findings
of
the
trial
judge
as
early
as
may,
and
during
the
course
of
their
relationship
in
1966,
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
the
parties
at
that
time
what
it
was
they
wanted
the
contract
for,
what
each
party
was
expecting
to
have
done.
unfortunately,
our
client
fulfilled
his
half
of
it
and
did
not
get
paid.
that
was
the
implied
contract.
that
was
the
meeting
of
the
minds
that
the
district
judge
found
that
the
ninth
circuit
courts
did
not
rely
upon.
it
could
not
say
those
findings
were
clearly
erroneous.
it
simply
found
that
it
had
another
issue
to
meet,
and
that
is
the
one
of
the
subcontractor
status.
and
the
reason
that
question
came
up
was
principally
so
our
opponents
at
that
time
could
argue
they
had
not
have
timely
notice
of
our
claim,
when
the
essence
of
it
was
they
had
had
notice
far
prior
to
the
time
they
get
into
conceding
to
us
that
they
owe
us
for
the
last
two
shipments.
as
far
as
the
venue
question
is
concerned
urged
here
as
being
jurisdictional,
i
think
the
authority
set
forth
in
our
brief
adequately
handle
that.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
that
the
bonding
company
with
miller
act
coverage
on
this
project
correctly
we
believe
by
the
ninth
circuit,
was
not
subjected
to
liability
for
the
shipments
to
south
carolina.
the
prime
contractor
was
we
feel
that
was
correctly
done.
and
i
think
that
would
be
adequate
for
us.
thank
you.
