mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
lost
this
case
below,
not
because
of
the
legal
issues
that
they
would
try
to
raise
here,
but
because
of
the
controlling
facts
in
issue.
as
i
will
develop
in
my
argument,
these
were
head
on
controversies
which
chief
judge
robson
as
the
trier
of
fact
decided
against
the
government
on
the
basis
of
a
meticulous
2-year
review
of
all
of
the
evidence
in
this
lengthy
trial
record.
thus
it
is
our
position
contrary
to
that
of
my
distinguished
opponent
that
the
real
issue
before
this
court
on
appeal
is
whether
these
findings
were
clearly
erroneous.
there
are
five
factual
determinations
below
which
are
particularly
--
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
i
think
that
the
facts
which
support
that
legal
conclusion
are
--
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
my
answer
to
that
is
no.
there
are
five
controlling
factual
determinations
below
which
i
particularly
want
to
list
briefly
before
focusing
under
evidentiary
support
and
implications.
as
to
the
central
facts
found
against
the
governments
case
these
included;
first,
the
fact
that
the
acquired
company
united
electric
is
dead
competitively
in
all
of
the
market’s
alleged
including
those
urged
by
the
government
and
it
cannot
be
resurrected.
second,
it
was
found
that
united
electric
and
freeman
would
not
and
could
not
compete
with
each
other
to
any
substantial
degree
and
that
was
a
fact,
whatever
the
lines
of
commerce
and
whatever
the
sections
of
the
country
chosen.
third,
it
was
found
that
the
combination
had
been
in
effect
since
1959.
the
evidence
was
that
it
had
not
adversely
effected
competition,
however,
that
competition
was
defined.
fourth,
it
was
found
that
present
in
the
markets
served
by
the
united
electric-freeman
were
large
sophisticated
buyers,
wielding
substantial
bargaining
power
and
practiced
in
the
ability
of
playing
one
coal
company
against
the
other
and
coal
itself
against
alternative
forms
of
energy.
this
fact
spoke
convincingly,
an
explanation
of
why
is
the
government
virtually
admitted
and
as
the
court
found
below
there
had
been
abundant
competition
in
the
midwest
coal
industry
in
the
past
which
was
certain
to
continue.
moreover,
the
fact
that
purchases
of
coal
and
other
fuels
were
made
by
powerful
sophisticated
buyers,
place
the
merger
in
a
totally
different
factual
context
than
that
present
in
other
section
7
cases
before
this
court,
most
notably
von's
grocery,
pabst
and
philadelphia
national
bank.
if,
based
on
a
virtual
and
an
unprecedented
census
in
this
record
of
the
very
consumers
on
whose
behalf
this
action
was
purportedly
brought,
including
carefully
reasoned
testimony
from
buyers
of
more
than
one
half
of
all
the
coal
produced
in
the
midwest.
chief
judge
robinson
found
that,
quoting
from
page
65a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
“evidence
from
numerous
knowledgeable
industry
representatives
including
competitors
and
customers
of
united
electric
and
freeman
confirms
the
defendant’s
condition
--
contention
that
the
challenged
combination
has
not
led
and
is
not
likely
to
lead
to
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition.”
in
developing
these
now
and
turning
to
the
facts
--
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
yes,
mr.
justice.
in
fact,
that
was
our
position
at
trial.
at
the
trial
the
government
took
a
contrary
position.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
now
the
government
agrees
with
us.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
i
think
they’ve
been
answered,
mr.
justice.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
there
is
no
explanation
of
that
in
the
record
at
all,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
and
which
brings
up
the
point
that
we’ve
made
in
our
brief
that
the
--
that
section
7
cases
and
section
7
itself
was
designed
to
deal
with
incipient
mergers
with
anti
--
a
merger
whose
anti-competitive
effects
was
ripening.
this
factual
situation
far
from
ripening
into
anti-competitive
effect
is
--
it
were
--
first
of
all
it
never
had
one
and
secondly,
the
combination
is
in
effect
over
at
this
point.
in
turning
to
the
facts,
i
respectfully
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
the
proposed
findings
filed
by
defendants
in
the
trial
court
and
particularly
the
numerous
citations
to
the
record
that
appear
therein.
these
proposed
findings
are
at
pages
880
to
1016
of
the
joint
appendix
and
are
a
virtual
encyclopedia
of
the
facts
and
the
evidence
in
this
case.
now,
among
the
most
compelling
of
the
central
determinations
made
below
is
that
united
electric
is
just
not
a
competitive
factor
in
any
of
the
markets
alleged,
including
those
suggested
by
the
government
and
it
cannot
become
one.
and
while
this
was
one
of
the
most
hotly
disputed
issues
at
trial,
the
trial
court’s
findings
on
united
electric’s
terminal
condition
are
no
longer
seriously
challenged
by
the
government
in
this
appeal.
i
will
say
that
i
think
that
since
the
briefs
in
mr.
friedman’s
argument
today
that
perhaps
they’ve
gone
back
to
that,
but
in
any
event
as
the
court
below
found,
united
electric
was
and
is
a
competitively
more
abound
illinois
coal
producer
which
by
the
close
of
this
current
year
will
be
operating
only
two
strip
mines
of
the
six
it
had
when
the
acquisition
took
place
14
years
ago.
virtually
all
of
the
united
electric’s
minable
coal
reserves
had
been
sold
pursuant
to
long-term
contracts
with
utilities
and
it
has
no
realistic
hope
of
obtaining
additional
reserves
to
serve
any
of
the
markets
alleged
by
the
parties
to
this
litigation.
precisely
to
this
point
was
the
trial
testimony
of
a.h.
davis,
president
of
central
illinois
light
company.
when
asked
by
the
government
on
cross-examination
whether
he
was
in
any
position
to
say
that
united
electric-freeman
combination
would
have
no
effect
on
his
company,
he
responded
as
follows,
this
is
at
page
1213
of
the
joint
appendix.
“well,
we
have
studied
the
united
electric
reserves,
mr.
simms
and
we
just
can’t
see
where
united
electric
has
the
reserves
to
be
a
factor
in
the
coal
business
as
far
as
we’re
concerned.”
united
electric
is
in
fact
a
company
that
has
been
in
liquidation
for
a
goodly
number
of
years
and
that
process
cannot
be
reversed.
it
was
anticipation
of
this
that
led
the
company
in
the
1960’s,
i'm
sorry,
in
the
1950’s,
unsuccessfully
as
the
court
noted
below
and
that
is
at
page
8a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
“to
seek
affiliation
with
other
coal
producer.”
and
when
freeman
obtained
control
of
united
electric
in
1959,
it
found
the
company
with
only
a
short
term
supply
of
minable
reserves.
irrefutable
evidence
of
this
is
contained
in
a
lengthy
memorandum
by
the
company's
land
manager,
united
electric’s
land
manager
some
20
years
ago
in
november
of
1955,
four
years
before
the
control
took
place,
this
appears
in
the
appendix
of
exhibits
at
page
1646.
in
this
memorandum,
tom
lathermer,
in
a
desperate
plea,
where
united
electric
to
improve
its
coal
reserve
position
notes
that
quote,
“we
have,
during
years
examine
something
over
200
coal
fields.
of
those
we've
taken
up
only
seven,
some
of
the
best
were
dropped
without
going
into.”
lathermer
further
observes
that
“practically,
all
of
our
competitors
have
a
far
better
organization
for
prospecting
than
we.”
the
memo
ends
with
a
follow
up,
again,
this
is
1955.“
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
entire
problem
at
length
with
you.
some
place
where
we
can
have
plenty
of
time
to
go
over
it
thoroughly
as
i
am
afraid,
we
are
not
building
up
properly
the
basis
upon
which
our
future
lies.”
now
during
his
deposition
the
company’s
former
chief
executive
officer,
who
retired
shortly
after
freeman
took
control,
defended
united’s
reserve
policy
under
his
pre-merger
administration
on
the
basis
that
the
company
had
other
uses
for
its
money
and
the
company
had
lost
half
its
business
to
gas
and
oil,
that
appears
in
the
record
at
page
145.
mr.
lathermer’s
prediction
of
some
two
years
ago
unfortunately
came
true
in
spades.
notwithstanding
the
vigorous,
but
unsuccessful
efforts
of
freeman,
contrary
to
mr.
friedman’s
argument
are
documented
over
and
over
again
in
this
record,
freeman’s
and
general
dynamics
attempts
to
reverse
united
electric’s
liquidating
position.
united
electric’s
reserve
position
was
discussed
time
and
again,
commencing
at
the
board
meetings,
commencing
with
control
by
freeman,
that
is
in
the
record.
the
united
electric’s
vice
president
for
operation
testified
that
he
had
an
open
book,
an
open
check
book,
to
acquire
reserves.
the
company’s
former
president
at
the
trial
testified
that
he
put
no
restrictions
on
the
company
in
acquiring
reserves
as
long
as
they
were
black.
so
compelling
was
this
evidence
that
even
the
government
stated
at
trial,
“that
after
1959
ulysses
management
sought
to
acquire
economically
recoverable
reserves.”
my
distinguished
opponent
would
try
to
walk
away
from
that
concession
now,
saying,
“well,
that’s
talking
about
--
that’s
not
talking
about
the
future.”
but
the
fact
is
that
the
question
of
future
reserve
prospects
is
one
best
committed
as
it
was
in
this
case
to
expert
testimony
industry
knowledge
and
not
lay
speculation
or
what
we
submit
is
an
incredible
plea
for
judicial
notice
contained
in
the
government’s
brief
in
chief.
finally,
on
united
electric’s
inability
to
regain
it’s
lost
--
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
yes.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
the
judicial
notice
that
they
request
--
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
that
united
electric
will
acquire
additional
reserves
in
the
future,
that
is
what
the
plea
for
judicial
notice
is
your
honor.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
finally,
on
united
electric’s
inability
to
regain
its
lost
competitive
position
in
the
future
--
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
to
the
contrary
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
record
is
the
other
way.
while
mr.
colby
did
testify
that
the
company
always
--
that
their
mines
ended
up
having
more
coal
than
they
had
thought
at
the
outset,
the
fact
is
that
we
have
the
mary
moore
mine
of
united
electric
that
closed
two
years
earlier
than
anticipated.
we
now
have
the
banner
mine
of
united
electric
which
isclosing
this
year,
a
--
three
years
earlier
anticipated.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
oh!
yes.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
that’s
correct.
i'm
sorry
mr.
chief
justice,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
yes,
that’s
correct.
finally
on
united
electric’s
inability
to
regain
its
lost
competitive
position
in
the
future.
we
need
only
observe
that
this
was
confirmed
in
the
record
by
paul
weir
company,
one
of
the
world’s
leading
mining
engineering
consulting
firms
and
one
i
might
add,
is
frequently
used
by
the
federal
government
itself,
by
the
head
of
the
state
of
illinois
geological
survey,
by
an
experienced
independent
geologist
whose
life
work
had
been
acquiring
coal
fields
for
producers
and
by
other
knowledgeable
industry
witnesses.
as
frank
nugent,
president
of
united
freeman,
put
it
in
his
deposition
by
the
government,
i
think
this
really
sums
it
up.
let
me
answer
at
this
way
mr.
cusack
and
maybe
it
will
save
sometime.
the
people
who
are
in
the
business,
knowledgeable
as
i
said
before
such
as
mr.
kels,
mr.
mollins,
and
norman
kelb
are
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
strip
acreage
that
is
available
in
this
state
and
there
is
not
any
necessity
for
any
conversation
between
me
and
people
in
the
business
as
to
whether
there
are
strip
reserves
available.
the
question
is
not
debatable.
we
know
that
they
are
not
there,
so
there's
just
isn’t
anything
to
discuss.
that
goes
down
to
cab
engineers
who
have
just
been
in
the
business
a
couple
of
years.
there
is
not
a
utility
man
in
the
state,
a
knowledgeable
utility
man
in
the
state
who
does
not
know
that
the
strip
reserves
are
not
available.
there
is
not
a
salesman
selling
shovels
and
equipments
who
does
not
know
that
the
reserves
are
not
available.
they
have
a
key
interest
in
it.
the
caterpillar
tractor
company
are
knowledgeable
in
that
area.
they
know
the
reserves
are
not
available.
their
sales
programs
are
directed
elsewhere
because
the
reserves
are
not
here.
this
is
not
a
question
that
isdebatable
among
coal
people.
it
is
an
accepted
fact
that
reserves
are
not
here,
that
testimony
appears
at
page
62
of
the
record.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
and
that
would
be
my
position
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
don’t
believe
i
need
to
go
back
far
because
in
the
context
of
this
case,
you
have
the
lack
of
competition
between
freeman
and
united
electric.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
no.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
no.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
there
were
four
instances
and
i
believe
these
are
mentioned
in
our
brief
where
united
electric
was
able
to
enter
into
long-term
contracts.
this
took
place
in
1966
or
so,
able
to
enter
into
long
term
contracts
because
at
the
tail
end
of
the
20-year
period
involved,
freeman
was
willing
to
guarantee
that
there
would
be
coal
there
for
the
utility.
in
other
words,
--
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
the
two
competitors
of
freeman
it
did
not
to
--
it
has
to
be
looked
at
it
seems
to
me
from
the
utility
stand
point.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
if
permitted
united
electric
to
provide
more
vigorous
competition
against
the
coal
companies
with
whom
they
were
competing.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
that’s
correct.
beyond
united
electric’s
terminal
condition
whether
viewed
in
1959
and
1967
or
at
any
other
time,
a
second
central
finding
of
the
decision
below
on
the
basis
of
all
the
evidence
was
that
contrary
to
the
government’s
allegations,
united
electric
and
freeman
would
not
and
could
not
compete
with
each
other
to
any
substantial
degree.
this
salient
fact,
one
unquestionably
committed
to
the
province
of
the
trier
of
fact
and
subsequently
determined
by
chief
judge
robinson
from
all
the
evidence
is
inescapable
as
the
court
below
recognized
even
under
the
government’s
market
definitions.
but
prior
to
trial,
the
government
admitted
in
its
answers
to
interrogatories
that
it
could
not
name
any
customer
of
either
united
electric
or
freeman
who
had
been
and
would
be
deprived
of
actual
or
potential
competition
because
of
the
combination,
their
answers
to
interrogatories
appear
at
page
305
and
318
of
the
joint
appendix.
at
the
trial
however,
the
government
relied
upon
charts,
showing
shipments
to
purported
common
customers
of
united
electric
and
freeman
in
its
attempt
to
find
actual
and
potential
competition
between
them.
however,
based
on
the
evidence
from
the
very
customers
involved
on
these
charts
that
testimony
and
the
testimony
of
the
government’s
own
economist
and
the
testimony
of
the
defendant’s
executives,
the
government’s
charts
were
totally
discredited
and
the
information
shown
thereon
was
demonstrated
to
be
flat
wrong.
many
of
the
shipments
weren't
even
to
the
same
plant
and
others
were
of
non-competing
products,
albeit
to
the
same
plant
to
illustrate.
freeman
shipped
inland
steel
metallurgical
coal
for
making
steel,
while
united
electric
ship
inland
steam
coal
for
power
generation.
others
were
unique
situation
shown
at
trial
to
be
non
competitive,
take
tva
for
example.
united
electric’s
shipments
to
tva
involved
a
situation
where
adverse
river
conditions
precluded
it
from
making
its
normal
shipments.
tva’s
coal
purchaser
testified
at
trial
that
united
electric
was
not
a
potential
supplier
of
tva.
the
government’s
economist
agreed,
the
government’s
own
economist.
as
he
put
it,
this
is
at
1694
of
the
record,
“the
way
of
the
thing
occurred
in
the
record,
i
would
not
say
that
that
particular
shipment
represented
competition.”
executives
from
other
consumers
listed
on
the
government’s
charts
similarly
denied
that
both
united
electric
and
freeman
could've
competed
for
their
business.
in
view
of
the
simplicity
of
the
proposition
involved,
the
almost
unlimited
scope
of
pretrial
discovery
permitted
the
government,
the
11-year
period
that
the
combination
had
been
in
effect
by
the
time
of
trial
and
the
fact
that
the
court
had
before
it,
the
testimony
of
purchasers
of
more
than
one
half
of
the
coal
produced
in
the
midwest,
there
can
logically
be,
we
submit,
one
reason
why
the
government
failed
in
its
attempt
to
show
that
united
electric
and
freeman
were
substantial
potential
competitors
and
that
reason
is
simply
because
they
were
not.
and
this
was
because
of
the
different
locations
of
the
mines,
the
different
modes
and
cost
of
transportation
available
to
each
and
because
of
the
varying
quality
characteristics
of
their
respective
coals.
and
we
repeat
those
were
the
facts,
whatever
the
market’s
chosen
and
specifically
even
if
the
market
definition
issues
in
the
litigation
had
been
resolved
the
way
the
government
wanted
them
to
be.
another
central
finding
below
was
that
since
1959,
the
year
when
freeman
obtained
control
of
united
electric,
a
fact
by
the
way
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
anti-trust
division
at
that
time
which
took
no
action,
the
court
found
that
since
1959,
the
united
electric-freeman
combination
had
not
adversely
effected
competition
whether
the
markets
used
for
that
analysis
were
those
of
the
government
or
the
defendants.
that
finding
was
based
upon
an
analysis
made
by
the
court
of
the
structure
of
the
coal
industry
and
its
markets
upon
the
testimony
of
industry
representatives
as
well
as
experts
and
upon
the
government’s
own
admissions.
this
showed
first
as
i've
discussed
that
united
electric
and
freeman
would
not
and
could
not
compete
to
any
substantial
degree.
beyond
that,
the
trial
court
specifically
found
that
the
record
was
not
only,
“devoid
of
any
signs
of
anti
competitive
performance
and
behavior
in
the
coal
industry
but
rather
the
past
performance
of
the
industry
suggests
there
has
been
intense
competition
among
coal
producers.”
in
fact,
the
government
in
response
to
defendant’s
proposed
findings
below
was
forced
to
concede
that
it
and
this
is
the
government’s
own
words,
quote
it
has
never
asserted
during
the
20
years
proceeding
1967
that
the
coal
industry
was
not
competitive.
the
government
acknowledged
moreover
that
the
mine
mouth
price
of
coal
in
1968
was
less
than
at
the
beginning
of
the
post-war
period
despite
general
inflation
in
wholesale
prices
and
that
there
had
been
marked
improvements
in
coal
technology
techniques
and
productivity.
the
trial
court
specifically
found,
“from
all
the
evidence
presented
at
trial
it
appears
that
coal
producers
will
be
under
continuing
pressure
to
reduce
costs
and
keep
prices
low
if
they
are
to
continue
to
serve
their
last
remaining
large
market
for
steam
coal
among
the
factors
which
made
this
clear
where
the
sophistication
and
market
power
of
coal
buyers
in
the
presence
of
a
substantial
number
of
viable
coal
competitors.”
in
addition,
the
court
found
particularly
significance,
the
wealth
of
evidence
dealing
with
the
tremendous
competitive
pressure
placed
on
coal
producers
from
suppliers
of
alternative
fuels.
this
pressure
was
expected
to
intensify
in
the
future
particularly
in
light
of
the
ever
increasing
environmental
consideration.
commonwealth
edison
spokesman
at
trial
summed
up
the
situation
as
follows
at
page
1414
of
the
record,
“well,
as
far
as
commonwealth
edison
is
concerned,
we
have
sort
of
have
put
our
eggs
in
the
nuclear
basket.
we
believe
that
nuclear
power
is
the
best
way
to
provide
base
load
electric
generation
and
we
intend
to
move
in
this
direction.
indeed
a
representative
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
testified
that
in
the
long-term
the
most
economical
way
to
generate
electricity
would
be
a
combination
of
nuclear
and
pump
storage
facilities
together
with
gas
turbine
picking
units.
moreover,
even
with
respect
to
the
government’s
coal
production
statistics
which
we
contend
were
improperly
aggregated
and
thus
meaningless,
an
obscured
the
fact
that
united
electric
and
freeman
were
predominantly
complementary
rather
than
competitive
companies.
it
was
shown
then
on
the
government’s
production
statistics
that
excluding
peabody,
the
production
shares
of
the
two,
four
and
ten
largest
producers
since
1959
remained
stable
or
declined,
this
is
shown
at
pages
1276
and
77
of
the
appendix
of
exhibits.
the
effect
that
peabody's
increase
in
size
has
had
on
the
midwestern
coal
industry,
has
of
course
been
cured
to
the
government’s
satisfaction
by
virtue
of
the
divestiture
consent
decree
it
obtained
against
peabody
in
1967
and
deconcentration
has
been
further
advanced
by
the
entry
of
the
humble
oil
into
coal
production.
the
establishment
of
the
midland
operation
divested
by
peabody
and
the
continued
decline
of
the
united-freeman
position.
it
should
be
noted
in
this
latter
regard
that
the
evidence
was
that
united
electric-freeman
combination
accounted
for
less
of
the
midwest
coal
production
in
1967
than
it
did
in
1959.
in
fact,
as
the
court
found
below,
the
combination
had
experienced
more
than
a
10%
decrease
in
its
percentage
of
such
production
since
1959.
the
court
anticipated
that
this
would
continue
to
drop
as
united
electric’s
mines
closed
as
their
reserves
played
out.
that
these
predictions
have
become
true
is
a
matter
of
which
we
submit
this
court
could
take
judicial
notice
by
examining
the
post-trial
publications
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
united
states’
bureau
of
mines.
these
show
that
united
electric-freeman’s
combined
coal
production
for
1972
was
almost
4
million
tons
less
than
the
14
million
ton
total
in
1967
and
that
it's
share
of
midwest
production
has
dropped
by
more
a
third.
the
final
factual
finding
upon
which
i
wish
to
focus
was
the
testimony
of
knowledgeable
industry
witnesses
in
this
case.
notwithstanding
a
diligent
government
search
before
trial
for
competitors
or
customers
of
the
combination
whose
testimony
would
tend
to
prove
the
alleged
adverse
effect
on
competition,
the
government
was
unable
to
find
a
single
member
of
the
class
for
whose
benefit
this
action
was
purportedly
brought
to
add
any
substance
to
its
claims.
the
defendants,
however,
did
adduce
evidence
from
a
broad
cross
section
of
both
producers
and
consumers
to
the
effect
that
the
combination
had
not
had
and
would
not
have
an
adverse
effect
on
competition.
this
came
from
large,
medium
size
and
small
public
utilities,
a
rural
electric
cooperative,
a
federal
electric
authority,
a
retail
coal
dealer
and
several
industrial
concerns
as
well
as
large
and
small
coal
producers
and
the
significant
thing
here
about
this
testimony
of
consumers
and
producers
is
like
is
that
it
came
from
knowledgeable
witnesses
who
gave
concrete
reasons
for
their
conclusions
as
was
required
by
this
court’s
admonition
in
philadelphia
national
bank.
the
most
dramatic
example,
i
submit
of
this
took
place
during
the
government’s
lone
attempt
to
establish
that
these
witnesses
were
in
different
to
and
unsophisticated
about
the
competitive
implications
of
mergers
of
coal
producers.
this
occurred
during
the
cross-examination
by
the
government
of
davis,
president
of
central
illinois
light
company.
this
elicited
the
fact
that
mr.
davis
had
in
the
past
taken
the
initiative
in
complaining
to
the
anti-trust
division.
when
his
evaluation
led
him
to
conclude
that
another
merger
between
coal
producers
did
pose
a
threat
to
competition,
a
question
was
asked
of
mr.
davis,
“would
you
be
concern
mr.
davis
as
president
of
selco
with
uec
and
freeman
merged
with
trueex.
as
your
department
undoubtedly
knows,
mr.
davis
testified,
“we
made
a
compliant
several
years
ago
about
the
merger
of
two
coal
companies
in
our
area
and
you
have
reached
the
satisfactory
settlement,
i
take
it
with
those
two
companies.
so,
anything
that
we
feel
reduces
the
amount
of
competition
in
our
area,
we
are
certainly
not
that
bashful
about
making
a
complaint.”
if
trueex
were
emerged
with
say
peabody
in
our
area,
wed
make
another
complaint.
but
why
would
that
bother
you
mr.
davis,
the
government
asked,
mr.
davis
said,
“it’s
a
reduction
of
competition
in
our
area.”
the
government’s
first
response
to
these
determinations
--
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
i'm
sorry
mr.
chief
justice.
yes,
that’s
page
1222
to
23
in
the
--
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
that’s
correct.
the
government’s
first
response
to
these
determinations
is
that
judge
robinson
somehow
did
not
make
the
proper
structural
analysis
dictated
by
the
cases.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
trouble
with
that
argument
is
two-fold.
first
of
all,
it
does
not
avoid
the
hard
reality
of
the
specific
finding
by
the
trial
court
that
the
combination
would
not
have
an
adverse
effect
on
competition
even
if
the
government’s
product
in
geographic
market
definitions
were
accepted
in
full.
the
second
trouble
is
that
the
trial
court
did
in
fact
make
the
structural
analysis
which
the
government
claims
is
missing
and
did
so
in
conformity
with
the
cases.
almost
one
third
of
the
opinion
below
is
devoted
to
such
considerations
as
the
rankings
of
the
defendants
in
both
coal
production
and
coal
reserves,
the
background
of
the
coal
industry,
the
changes
in
the
demand
for
coal,
the
emergence
of
the
utilities
as
the
principle
market
for
coal,
the
changes
that
had
taken
place
in
production
techniques,
the
way
in
which
coal
producers
competed
for
their
principle
market
utilities
and
indeed
one
section
of
the
opinion
is
even
titled,
“changes
in
the
structure
of
the
coal
industry,”
are
over
read,
that
four
point
of
judge
robinson’s
opinion
he
declares
that
coal
is
the
subject
of
a
litigation.
now,
what
the
government
really
complains
about,
we
submit
is
that
the
court
refuse
to
decide
the
case
solely
in
the
numbers
the
government
had
put
on
their
charts.
now,
even
if
these
numbers
had
been
something
more
than
improperly
aggregated
coal
production
statistics
which
they
were
decidedly
not,
it
seems
to
us
that
writing
numbers
on
the
blackboard
is
not
enough
in
the
present
case
where
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
government
has
made
out
of
prima
facie
case
but
whether
on
the
basis
of
all
the
evidence
after
a
full
trial,
a
likely
adverse
on
effect
on
competition
has
been
shown.
even
where
the
statistical
data
and
evidence
is
not
misleading,
this
court
has
stressed
in
brown
shoe
that
its
important
should
not
obscure
that
only
a
further
examination
of
the
particular
market,
its
structure,
history,
probable
future
and
provide
the
appropriate
setting
for
judging
the
probable
anticompetitive
effect
of
the
merger.
square
to
the
point
here
is
the
testimony
at
trail
of
the
government’s
own
economist,
james
fulsome.
but
during
the
litigation,
it
came
to
our
attention
that
while
the
antitrust
division
was
trying
to
split
up
the
united
electric
and
freeman,
they
were
acting
affirmatively
at
the
same
time
to
approve
a
merger
of
two
other
illinois
coal
producers
that
would
have
been
structurally
indistinguishable
from
united
electric-freeman
with
the
resulting
combination
in
either
situation
constituting
the
second
largest
coal
producer
in
illinois
and
in
the
midwest.
now,
at
trial,
i
submitted
to
mr.
fulsome
a
hypothetical
based
solely
upon
the
structural
numbers
of
the
merger
which
the
government
said
it
would
approve.
i
asked
him
to
assume
that
the
two
companies
were
buyable
and
i
asked
him
whether
he
would
conclude
on
the
basis
of
those
facts
that
the
merger
posed
a
threat
to
competition.
mr.
fulsome
was
not
prepared
to
rest
an
appraisal
on
the
numbers
alone
as
he
quoted,
“i
would
still
want
more
information.
i
would
still
want
to
look
further.”
so
in
this
case,
if
the
government’s
numbers
did
anything
at
all
and
we
say
they
didn’t,
in
view
of
among
other
things,
they
are
improper
aggregation.
the
fact
that
production
data
rather
than
reserved
data
was
used
and
the
fact
that
even
then,
they
included
non-competing
forms
of
coal,
they
created
at
most
of
presumption
that
was
rebutted
and
overcome
by
the
facts
which
defendants
placed
in
evidence.
with
commonwealth
edison
testifying
that
they
have
put
their
eggs
in
the
nuclear
basket,
with
the
documented
loss
of
coal’s
position
in
other
markets,
were
the
undisputed
fact
that
a
coal
producer
competes
for
long-term
contracts
not
with
production’s
statistics
but
with
verifiable
uncommitted
coal
reserves
and
with
the
government’s
own
economist
challenging
the
use
of
the
eastern
interior
coal
province
sale’s
area
as
a
market
and
failing
to
support
the
proposition
that
illinois
was
a
market,
we
submit
that
the
trial
court
was
undoubtedly
correct
in
its
finding
at
page
65a.
that
the
only
evidence
produced
by
the
government
to
support
their
claim
of
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition
was
statistics
which
fail
to
reflect
the
very
real
competition
coal
faces
from
other
forms
of
energy
and
which
proofs
together
coal
producers
and
to
economically
unrealistic
markets
while
ignoring
the
key
factor
in
a
coal
producer’s
market
strength,
coal
reserves.
the
government’s
remaining
and
we
submit
late
arriving
argument
also
fails.
if
there’d
be
any
significance,
and
we
say
there
is
none,
that
the
fact
that
judge
robinson
entered
no
specific
findings
with
respect
to
united
electric’s
prospects
of
1959.
it
is
because
government
trial
counsel
not
only
failed
to
request
such
findings
but
asked
the
trial
court
not
to
make
them.
however,
defendants
did
propose
findings
on
evidence
that
they
had
put
in
the
record
concerning
united
electric’s
debilitated
condition
in
1959,
the
reasons
why
that
unhappy
circumstance
had
come
about
and
the
merger
efforts
of
united
before
1959
to
try
solve
the
problem.
in
the
face
of
the
lack
of
evidence
to
the
contrary,
however,
all
the
government
could
claim
at
trial
was
that
those
findings
were
irrelevant.
if
i
may
make
a
few
more
specific
comments
to
certain
other
things
that
mr.
friedman
touched
on
as
far
as
the
state
of
the
record.
i
would
suggest
a
careful
look
at
the
government’s
exhibit
on
mergers
since
1959,
that’s
at
--
that’s
at
page
106,
i
believe.
a
careful
analysis
of
that
will
show
that
almost
all
of
the
mergers
since
1959
have
involved
the
peabody
coal
company
as
i've
already
referred
to
and
that
another
rather
large
looking
one
on
the
record
was
in
fact
an
acquisition
of
an
existing
company
in
the
midwest
from
a
company
outside
the
midwest.
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
douglas’
observation
about
a
fuel
monopoly
--
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
a
question
sir.
there
is
a
reference
or
at
least
an
aspect
of
that
in
judge
robinson’s
opinion
in
which
he
does
note
that
25%
of
the
production
of
coal
in
the
midwest
has
been
produced
by
oil
companies.
general
dynamics
of
course
has
no
other
fuel
interest
or
utility
interest
for
that
matter,
other
than
these
two
coal
companies.
as
to
whether
ayrshire’s
attempt
to
deep
mining
proves
that
anybody
can
go
into
deep
mining,
i
would
respectfully
refer
the
court
to
the
testimony
of
ayrshire’s
witness
at
trial
on
that
subject
and
it
was
--
we
submit,
for
square
against
the
government.
as
far
as
general
dynamics
reserve
position,
a
coal
reserve
position
in
the
midwest
or
elsewhere
in
the
country,
that
has
not
changed
except
as
a
result
of
small
increments
of
the
two
coal
companies
involved
since
1959.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
competition
for
commonwealth
edison
has
to
be
viewed
it
seems
to
us
in
three
lights.
the
first
of
which
is
that
commonwealth
edison
is
a
unique,
unique
coal
purchaser
in
the
midwest.
it
purchases
one
third
of
all
the
production
in
the
state
of
illinois,
for
example.
unlike
any
other
coal
purchaser
revealed
by
either
the
government
or
ourselves,
it
must
buy
coal
from
a
variety
of
producing
districts.
we
believe
that
the
real
competition
then
for
edison’s
coal
purchasers
is
among
the
producers
in
a
district
and
not
between
different
districts.
secondly,
in
view
of
edison's
substantial
size,
their
world
leading
commitment
to
nuclear
energy,
the
sophistication
and
care
with
which
that
company
makes
every
fuel
decision
that
it
--
we
do
not
think
that
this
combination
could
have
any
effect
on
commonwealth
edison
as
indeed
was
confirmed
by
their
witness
at
trial.
a
dimension
of
these
i
think,
mr.
justice
powell
is
that
the
government’s
request
or
at
haste
to
point
out
i
should
say
at
trial
that
commonwealth
edison
does
not
take
unfair
advantage
of
coal
producers.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
yes,
your
honor.
those
are
--
in
defendant’s
exhibit
49,
i'm
sorry
not
49,
at
defendant’s
exhibit
55.
well,
that
discloses
only
the
producing
districts.
the
actual
names
of
the
customers,
i
do
not
think
it
is
shown,
but
i
could
be
wrong.
to
conclude,
we
submit
that
the
decision
below
comports
completely
with
settled
principles
of
merger
law
and
policy
and
signals
no
softening
out
or
a
retreat
from
established
barriers
to
anticompetitive
mergers.
the
findings
below,
we
submit
were
not
clearly
erroneous
and
we
respectfully
urge
that
the
judgment
be
affirmed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
that
would
conclude
my
argument.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
government
lost
this
case
below,
not
because
of
the
legal
issues
that
they
would
try
to
raise
here,
but
because
of
the
controlling
facts
in
issue.
as
i
will
develop
in
my
argument,
these
were
head
on
controversies
which
chief
judge
robson
as
the
trier
of
fact
decided
against
the
government
on
the
basis
of
a
meticulous
2-year
review
of
all
of
the
evidence
in
this
lengthy
trial
record.
thus
it
is
our
position
contrary
to
that
of
my
distinguished
opponent
that
the
real
issue
before
this
court
on
appeal
is
whether
these
findings
were
clearly
erroneous.
there
are
five
factual
determinations
below
which
are
particularly
--
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
i
think
that
the
facts
which
support
that
legal
conclusion
are
--
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
my
answer
to
that
is
no.
there
are
five
controlling
factual
determinations
below
which
i
particularly
want
to
list
briefly
before
focusing
under
evidentiary
support
and
implications.
as
to
the
central
facts
found
against
the
governments
case
these
included;
first,
the
fact
that
the
acquired
company
united
electric
is
dead
competitively
in
all
of
the
market’s
alleged
including
those
urged
by
the
government
and
it
cannot
be
resurrected.
second,
it
was
found
that
united
electric
and
freeman
would
not
and
could
not
compete
with
each
other
to
any
substantial
degree
and
that
was
a
fact,
whatever
the
lines
of
commerce
and
whatever
the
sections
of
the
country
chosen.
third,
it
was
found
that
the
combination
had
been
in
effect
since
1959.
the
evidence
was
that
it
had
not
adversely
effected
competition,
however,
that
competition
was
defined.
fourth,
it
was
found
that
present
in
the
markets
served
by
the
united
electric-freeman
were
large
sophisticated
buyers,
wielding
substantial
bargaining
power
and
practiced
in
the
ability
of
playing
one
coal
company
against
the
other
and
coal
itself
against
alternative
forms
of
energy.
this
fact
spoke
convincingly,
an
explanation
of
why
is
the
government
virtually
admitted
and
as
the
court
found
below
there
had
been
abundant
competition
in
the
midwest
coal
industry
in
the
past
which
was
certain
to
continue.
moreover,
the
fact
that
purchases
of
coal
and
other
fuels
were
made
by
powerful
sophisticated
buyers,
place
the
merger
in
a
totally
different
factual
context
than
that
present
in
other
section
7
cases
before
this
court,
most
notably
von's
grocery,
pabst
and
philadelphia
national
bank.
if,
based
on
a
virtual
and
an
unprecedented
census
in
this
record
of
the
very
consumers
on
whose
behalf
this
action
was
purportedly
brought,
including
carefully
reasoned
testimony
from
buyers
of
more
than
one
half
of
all
the
coal
produced
in
the
midwest.
chief
judge
robinson
found
that,
quoting
from
page
65a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
“evidence
from
numerous
knowledgeable
industry
representatives
including
competitors
and
customers
of
united
electric
and
freeman
confirms
the
defendant’s
condition
--
contention
that
the
challenged
combination
has
not
led
and
is
not
likely
to
lead
to
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition.”
in
developing
these
now
and
turning
to
the
facts
--
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
yes,
mr.
justice.
in
fact,
that
was
our
position
at
trial.
at
the
trial
the
government
took
a
contrary
position.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
now
the
government
agrees
with
us.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
i
think
they’ve
been
answered,
mr.
justice.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
there
is
no
explanation
of
that
in
the
record
at
all,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
and
which
brings
up
the
point
that
we’ve
made
in
our
brief
that
the
--
that
section
7
cases
and
section
7
itself
was
designed
to
deal
with
incipient
mergers
with
anti
--
a
merger
whose
anti-competitive
effects
was
ripening.
this
factual
situation
far
from
ripening
into
anti-competitive
effect
is
--
it
were
--
first
of
all
it
never
had
one
and
secondly,
the
combination
is
in
effect
over
at
this
point.
in
turning
to
the
facts,
i
respectfully
direct
the
court’s
attention
to
the
proposed
findings
filed
by
defendants
in
the
trial
court
and
particularly
the
numerous
citations
to
the
record
that
appear
therein.
these
proposed
findings
are
at
pages
880
to
1016
of
the
joint
appendix
and
are
a
virtual
encyclopedia
of
the
facts
and
the
evidence
in
this
case.
now,
among
the
most
compelling
of
the
central
determinations
made
below
is
that
united
electric
is
just
not
a
competitive
factor
in
any
of
the
markets
alleged,
including
those
suggested
by
the
government
and
it
cannot
become
one.
and
while
this
was
one
of
the
most
hotly
disputed
issues
at
trial,
the
trial
court’s
findings
on
united
electric’s
terminal
condition
are
no
longer
seriously
challenged
by
the
government
in
this
appeal.
i
will
say
that
i
think
that
since
the
briefs
in
mr.
friedman’s
argument
today
that
perhaps
they’ve
gone
back
to
that,
but
in
any
event
as
the
court
below
found,
united
electric
was
and
is
a
competitively
more
abound
illinois
coal
producer
which
by
the
close
of
this
current
year
will
be
operating
only
two
strip
mines
of
the
six
it
had
when
the
acquisition
took
place
14
years
ago.
virtually
all
of
the
united
electric’s
minable
coal
reserves
had
been
sold
pursuant
to
long-term
contracts
with
utilities
and
it
has
no
realistic
hope
of
obtaining
additional
reserves
to
serve
any
of
the
markets
alleged
by
the
parties
to
this
litigation.
precisely
to
this
point
was
the
trial
testimony
of
a.h.
davis,
president
of
central
illinois
light
company.
when
asked
by
the
government
on
cross-examination
whether
he
was
in
any
position
to
say
that
united
electric-freeman
combination
would
have
no
effect
on
his
company,
he
responded
as
follows,
this
is
at
page
1213
of
the
joint
appendix.
“well,
we
have
studied
the
united
electric
reserves,
mr.
simms
and
we
just
can’t
see
where
united
electric
has
the
reserves
to
be
a
factor
in
the
coal
business
as
far
as
we’re
concerned.”
united
electric
is
in
fact
a
company
that
has
been
in
liquidation
for
a
goodly
number
of
years
and
that
process
cannot
be
reversed.
it
was
anticipation
of
this
that
led
the
company
in
the
1960’s,
i'm
sorry,
in
the
1950’s,
unsuccessfully
as
the
court
noted
below
and
that
is
at
page
8a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
“to
seek
affiliation
with
other
coal
producer.”
and
when
freeman
obtained
control
of
united
electric
in
1959,
it
found
the
company
with
only
a
short
term
supply
of
minable
reserves.
irrefutable
evidence
of
this
is
contained
in
a
lengthy
memorandum
by
the
company's
land
manager,
united
electric’s
land
manager
some
20
years
ago
in
november
of
1955,
four
years
before
the
control
took
place,
this
appears
in
the
appendix
of
exhibits
at
page
1646.
in
this
memorandum,
tom
lathermer,
in
a
desperate
plea,
where
united
electric
to
improve
its
coal
reserve
position
notes
that
quote,
“we
have,
during
years
examine
something
over
200
coal
fields.
of
those
we've
taken
up
only
seven,
some
of
the
best
were
dropped
without
going
into.”
lathermer
further
observes
that
“practically,
all
of
our
competitors
have
a
far
better
organization
for
prospecting
than
we.”
the
memo
ends
with
a
follow
up,
again,
this
is
1955.“
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
entire
problem
at
length
with
you.
some
place
where
we
can
have
plenty
of
time
to
go
over
it
thoroughly
as
i
am
afraid,
we
are
not
building
up
properly
the
basis
upon
which
our
future
lies.”
now
during
his
deposition
the
company’s
former
chief
executive
officer,
who
retired
shortly
after
freeman
took
control,
defended
united’s
reserve
policy
under
his
pre-merger
administration
on
the
basis
that
the
company
had
other
uses
for
its
money
and
the
company
had
lost
half
its
business
to
gas
and
oil,
that
appears
in
the
record
at
page
145.
mr.
lathermer’s
prediction
of
some
two
years
ago
unfortunately
came
true
in
spades.
notwithstanding
the
vigorous,
but
unsuccessful
efforts
of
freeman,
contrary
to
mr.
friedman’s
argument
are
documented
over
and
over
again
in
this
record,
freeman’s
and
general
dynamics
attempts
to
reverse
united
electric’s
liquidating
position.
united
electric’s
reserve
position
was
discussed
time
and
again,
commencing
at
the
board
meetings,
commencing
with
control
by
freeman,
that
is
in
the
record.
the
united
electric’s
vice
president
for
operation
testified
that
he
had
an
open
book,
an
open
check
book,
to
acquire
reserves.
the
company’s
former
president
at
the
trial
testified
that
he
put
no
restrictions
on
the
company
in
acquiring
reserves
as
long
as
they
were
black.
so
compelling
was
this
evidence
that
even
the
government
stated
at
trial,
“that
after
1959
ulysses
management
sought
to
acquire
economically
recoverable
reserves.”
my
distinguished
opponent
would
try
to
walk
away
from
that
concession
now,
saying,
“well,
that’s
talking
about
--
that’s
not
talking
about
the
future.”
but
the
fact
is
that
the
question
of
future
reserve
prospects
is
one
best
committed
as
it
was
in
this
case
to
expert
testimony
industry
knowledge
and
not
lay
speculation
or
what
we
submit
is
an
incredible
plea
for
judicial
notice
contained
in
the
government’s
brief
in
chief.
finally,
on
united
electric’s
inability
to
regain
it’s
lost
--
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
yes.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
the
judicial
notice
that
they
request
--
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
that
united
electric
will
acquire
additional
reserves
in
the
future,
that
is
what
the
plea
for
judicial
notice
is
your
honor.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
finally,
on
united
electric’s
inability
to
regain
its
lost
competitive
position
in
the
future
--
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
to
the
contrary
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
the
record
is
the
other
way.
while
mr.
colby
did
testify
that
the
company
always
--
that
their
mines
ended
up
having
more
coal
than
they
had
thought
at
the
outset,
the
fact
is
that
we
have
the
mary
moore
mine
of
united
electric
that
closed
two
years
earlier
than
anticipated.
we
now
have
the
banner
mine
of
united
electric
which
isclosing
this
year,
a
--
three
years
earlier
anticipated.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
oh!
yes.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
that’s
correct.
i'm
sorry
mr.
chief
justice,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
yes,
that’s
correct.
finally
on
united
electric’s
inability
to
regain
its
lost
competitive
position
in
the
future.
we
need
only
observe
that
this
was
confirmed
in
the
record
by
paul
weir
company,
one
of
the
world’s
leading
mining
engineering
consulting
firms
and
one
i
might
add,
is
frequently
used
by
the
federal
government
itself,
by
the
head
of
the
state
of
illinois
geological
survey,
by
an
experienced
independent
geologist
whose
life
work
had
been
acquiring
coal
fields
for
producers
and
by
other
knowledgeable
industry
witnesses.
as
frank
nugent,
president
of
united
freeman,
put
it
in
his
deposition
by
the
government,
i
think
this
really
sums
it
up.
let
me
answer
at
this
way
mr.
cusack
and
maybe
it
will
save
sometime.
the
people
who
are
in
the
business,
knowledgeable
as
i
said
before
such
as
mr.
kels,
mr.
mollins,
and
norman
kelb
are
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
strip
acreage
that
is
available
in
this
state
and
there
is
not
any
necessity
for
any
conversation
between
me
and
people
in
the
business
as
to
whether
there
are
strip
reserves
available.
the
question
is
not
debatable.
we
know
that
they
are
not
there,
so
there's
just
isn’t
anything
to
discuss.
that
goes
down
to
cab
engineers
who
have
just
been
in
the
business
a
couple
of
years.
there
is
not
a
utility
man
in
the
state,
a
knowledgeable
utility
man
in
the
state
who
does
not
know
that
the
strip
reserves
are
not
available.
there
is
not
a
salesman
selling
shovels
and
equipments
who
does
not
know
that
the
reserves
are
not
available.
they
have
a
key
interest
in
it.
the
caterpillar
tractor
company
are
knowledgeable
in
that
area.
they
know
the
reserves
are
not
available.
their
sales
programs
are
directed
elsewhere
because
the
reserves
are
not
here.
this
is
not
a
question
that
isdebatable
among
coal
people.
it
is
an
accepted
fact
that
reserves
are
not
here,
that
testimony
appears
at
page
62
of
the
record.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
and
that
would
be
my
position
mr.
justice
white,
but
i
don’t
believe
i
need
to
go
back
far
because
in
the
context
of
this
case,
you
have
the
lack
of
competition
between
freeman
and
united
electric.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
no.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
no.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
there
were
four
instances
and
i
believe
these
are
mentioned
in
our
brief
where
united
electric
was
able
to
enter
into
long-term
contracts.
this
took
place
in
1966
or
so,
able
to
enter
into
long
term
contracts
because
at
the
tail
end
of
the
20-year
period
involved,
freeman
was
willing
to
guarantee
that
there
would
be
coal
there
for
the
utility.
in
other
words,
--
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
the
two
competitors
of
freeman
it
did
not
to
--
it
has
to
be
looked
at
it
seems
to
me
from
the
utility
stand
point.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
if
permitted
united
electric
to
provide
more
vigorous
competition
against
the
coal
companies
with
whom
they
were
competing.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
that’s
correct.
beyond
united
electric’s
terminal
condition
whether
viewed
in
1959
and
1967
or
at
any
other
time,
a
second
central
finding
of
the
decision
below
on
the
basis
of
all
the
evidence
was
that
contrary
to
the
government’s
allegations,
united
electric
and
freeman
would
not
and
could
not
compete
with
each
other
to
any
substantial
degree.
this
salient
fact,
one
unquestionably
committed
to
the
province
of
the
trier
of
fact
and
subsequently
determined
by
chief
judge
robinson
from
all
the
evidence
is
inescapable
as
the
court
below
recognized
even
under
the
government’s
market
definitions.
but
prior
to
trial,
the
government
admitted
in
its
answers
to
interrogatories
that
it
could
not
name
any
customer
of
either
united
electric
or
freeman
who
had
been
and
would
be
deprived
of
actual
or
potential
competition
because
of
the
combination,
their
answers
to
interrogatories
appear
at
page
305
and
318
of
the
joint
appendix.
at
the
trial
however,
the
government
relied
upon
charts,
showing
shipments
to
purported
common
customers
of
united
electric
and
freeman
in
its
attempt
to
find
actual
and
potential
competition
between
them.
however,
based
on
the
evidence
from
the
very
customers
involved
on
these
charts
that
testimony
and
the
testimony
of
the
government’s
own
economist
and
the
testimony
of
the
defendant’s
executives,
the
government’s
charts
were
totally
discredited
and
the
information
shown
thereon
was
demonstrated
to
be
flat
wrong.
many
of
the
shipments
weren't
even
to
the
same
plant
and
others
were
of
non-competing
products,
albeit
to
the
same
plant
to
illustrate.
freeman
shipped
inland
steel
metallurgical
coal
for
making
steel,
while
united
electric
ship
inland
steam
coal
for
power
generation.
others
were
unique
situation
shown
at
trial
to
be
non
competitive,
take
tva
for
example.
united
electric’s
shipments
to
tva
involved
a
situation
where
adverse
river
conditions
precluded
it
from
making
its
normal
shipments.
tva’s
coal
purchaser
testified
at
trial
that
united
electric
was
not
a
potential
supplier
of
tva.
the
government’s
economist
agreed,
the
government’s
own
economist.
as
he
put
it,
this
is
at
1694
of
the
record,
“the
way
of
the
thing
occurred
in
the
record,
i
would
not
say
that
that
particular
shipment
represented
competition.”
executives
from
other
consumers
listed
on
the
government’s
charts
similarly
denied
that
both
united
electric
and
freeman
could've
competed
for
their
business.
in
view
of
the
simplicity
of
the
proposition
involved,
the
almost
unlimited
scope
of
pretrial
discovery
permitted
the
government,
the
11-year
period
that
the
combination
had
been
in
effect
by
the
time
of
trial
and
the
fact
that
the
court
had
before
it,
the
testimony
of
purchasers
of
more
than
one
half
of
the
coal
produced
in
the
midwest,
there
can
logically
be,
we
submit,
one
reason
why
the
government
failed
in
its
attempt
to
show
that
united
electric
and
freeman
were
substantial
potential
competitors
and
that
reason
is
simply
because
they
were
not.
and
this
was
because
of
the
different
locations
of
the
mines,
the
different
modes
and
cost
of
transportation
available
to
each
and
because
of
the
varying
quality
characteristics
of
their
respective
coals.
and
we
repeat
those
were
the
facts,
whatever
the
market’s
chosen
and
specifically
even
if
the
market
definition
issues
in
the
litigation
had
been
resolved
the
way
the
government
wanted
them
to
be.
another
central
finding
below
was
that
since
1959,
the
year
when
freeman
obtained
control
of
united
electric,
a
fact
by
the
way
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
anti-trust
division
at
that
time
which
took
no
action,
the
court
found
that
since
1959,
the
united
electric-freeman
combination
had
not
adversely
effected
competition
whether
the
markets
used
for
that
analysis
were
those
of
the
government
or
the
defendants.
that
finding
was
based
upon
an
analysis
made
by
the
court
of
the
structure
of
the
coal
industry
and
its
markets
upon
the
testimony
of
industry
representatives
as
well
as
experts
and
upon
the
government’s
own
admissions.
this
showed
first
as
i've
discussed
that
united
electric
and
freeman
would
not
and
could
not
compete
to
any
substantial
degree.
beyond
that,
the
trial
court
specifically
found
that
the
record
was
not
only,
“devoid
of
any
signs
of
anti
competitive
performance
and
behavior
in
the
coal
industry
but
rather
the
past
performance
of
the
industry
suggests
there
has
been
intense
competition
among
coal
producers.”
in
fact,
the
government
in
response
to
defendant’s
proposed
findings
below
was
forced
to
concede
that
it
and
this
is
the
government’s
own
words,
quote
it
has
never
asserted
during
the
20
years
proceeding
1967
that
the
coal
industry
was
not
competitive.
the
government
acknowledged
moreover
that
the
mine
mouth
price
of
coal
in
1968
was
less
than
at
the
beginning
of
the
post-war
period
despite
general
inflation
in
wholesale
prices
and
that
there
had
been
marked
improvements
in
coal
technology
techniques
and
productivity.
the
trial
court
specifically
found,
“from
all
the
evidence
presented
at
trial
it
appears
that
coal
producers
will
be
under
continuing
pressure
to
reduce
costs
and
keep
prices
low
if
they
are
to
continue
to
serve
their
last
remaining
large
market
for
steam
coal
among
the
factors
which
made
this
clear
where
the
sophistication
and
market
power
of
coal
buyers
in
the
presence
of
a
substantial
number
of
viable
coal
competitors.”
in
addition,
the
court
found
particularly
significance,
the
wealth
of
evidence
dealing
with
the
tremendous
competitive
pressure
placed
on
coal
producers
from
suppliers
of
alternative
fuels.
this
pressure
was
expected
to
intensify
in
the
future
particularly
in
light
of
the
ever
increasing
environmental
consideration.
commonwealth
edison
spokesman
at
trial
summed
up
the
situation
as
follows
at
page
1414
of
the
record,
“well,
as
far
as
commonwealth
edison
is
concerned,
we
have
sort
of
have
put
our
eggs
in
the
nuclear
basket.
we
believe
that
nuclear
power
is
the
best
way
to
provide
base
load
electric
generation
and
we
intend
to
move
in
this
direction.
indeed
a
representative
of
the
atomic
energy
commission
testified
that
in
the
long-term
the
most
economical
way
to
generate
electricity
would
be
a
combination
of
nuclear
and
pump
storage
facilities
together
with
gas
turbine
picking
units.
moreover,
even
with
respect
to
the
government’s
coal
production
statistics
which
we
contend
were
improperly
aggregated
and
thus
meaningless,
an
obscured
the
fact
that
united
electric
and
freeman
were
predominantly
complementary
rather
than
competitive
companies.
it
was
shown
then
on
the
government’s
production
statistics
that
excluding
peabody,
the
production
shares
of
the
two,
four
and
ten
largest
producers
since
1959
remained
stable
or
declined,
this
is
shown
at
pages
1276
and
77
of
the
appendix
of
exhibits.
the
effect
that
peabody's
increase
in
size
has
had
on
the
midwestern
coal
industry,
has
of
course
been
cured
to
the
government’s
satisfaction
by
virtue
of
the
divestiture
consent
decree
it
obtained
against
peabody
in
1967
and
deconcentration
has
been
further
advanced
by
the
entry
of
the
humble
oil
into
coal
production.
the
establishment
of
the
midland
operation
divested
by
peabody
and
the
continued
decline
of
the
united-freeman
position.
it
should
be
noted
in
this
latter
regard
that
the
evidence
was
that
united
electric-freeman
combination
accounted
for
less
of
the
midwest
coal
production
in
1967
than
it
did
in
1959.
in
fact,
as
the
court
found
below,
the
combination
had
experienced
more
than
a
10%
decrease
in
its
percentage
of
such
production
since
1959.
the
court
anticipated
that
this
would
continue
to
drop
as
united
electric’s
mines
closed
as
their
reserves
played
out.
that
these
predictions
have
become
true
is
a
matter
of
which
we
submit
this
court
could
take
judicial
notice
by
examining
the
post-trial
publications
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
united
states’
bureau
of
mines.
these
show
that
united
electric-freeman’s
combined
coal
production
for
1972
was
almost
4
million
tons
less
than
the
14
million
ton
total
in
1967
and
that
it's
share
of
midwest
production
has
dropped
by
more
a
third.
the
final
factual
finding
upon
which
i
wish
to
focus
was
the
testimony
of
knowledgeable
industry
witnesses
in
this
case.
notwithstanding
a
diligent
government
search
before
trial
for
competitors
or
customers
of
the
combination
whose
testimony
would
tend
to
prove
the
alleged
adverse
effect
on
competition,
the
government
was
unable
to
find
a
single
member
of
the
class
for
whose
benefit
this
action
was
purportedly
brought
to
add
any
substance
to
its
claims.
the
defendants,
however,
did
adduce
evidence
from
a
broad
cross
section
of
both
producers
and
consumers
to
the
effect
that
the
combination
had
not
had
and
would
not
have
an
adverse
effect
on
competition.
this
came
from
large,
medium
size
and
small
public
utilities,
a
rural
electric
cooperative,
a
federal
electric
authority,
a
retail
coal
dealer
and
several
industrial
concerns
as
well
as
large
and
small
coal
producers
and
the
significant
thing
here
about
this
testimony
of
consumers
and
producers
is
like
is
that
it
came
from
knowledgeable
witnesses
who
gave
concrete
reasons
for
their
conclusions
as
was
required
by
this
court’s
admonition
in
philadelphia
national
bank.
the
most
dramatic
example,
i
submit
of
this
took
place
during
the
government’s
lone
attempt
to
establish
that
these
witnesses
were
in
different
to
and
unsophisticated
about
the
competitive
implications
of
mergers
of
coal
producers.
this
occurred
during
the
cross-examination
by
the
government
of
davis,
president
of
central
illinois
light
company.
this
elicited
the
fact
that
mr.
davis
had
in
the
past
taken
the
initiative
in
complaining
to
the
anti-trust
division.
when
his
evaluation
led
him
to
conclude
that
another
merger
between
coal
producers
did
pose
a
threat
to
competition,
a
question
was
asked
of
mr.
davis,
“would
you
be
concern
mr.
davis
as
president
of
selco
with
uec
and
freeman
merged
with
trueex.
as
your
department
undoubtedly
knows,
mr.
davis
testified,
“we
made
a
compliant
several
years
ago
about
the
merger
of
two
coal
companies
in
our
area
and
you
have
reached
the
satisfactory
settlement,
i
take
it
with
those
two
companies.
so,
anything
that
we
feel
reduces
the
amount
of
competition
in
our
area,
we
are
certainly
not
that
bashful
about
making
a
complaint.”
if
trueex
were
emerged
with
say
peabody
in
our
area,
wed
make
another
complaint.
but
why
would
that
bother
you
mr.
davis,
the
government
asked,
mr.
davis
said,
“it’s
a
reduction
of
competition
in
our
area.”
the
government’s
first
response
to
these
determinations
--
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
i'm
sorry
mr.
chief
justice.
yes,
that’s
page
1222
to
23
in
the
--
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
that’s
correct.
the
government’s
first
response
to
these
determinations
is
that
judge
robinson
somehow
did
not
make
the
proper
structural
analysis
dictated
by
the
cases.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
trouble
with
that
argument
is
two-fold.
first
of
all,
it
does
not
avoid
the
hard
reality
of
the
specific
finding
by
the
trial
court
that
the
combination
would
not
have
an
adverse
effect
on
competition
even
if
the
government’s
product
in
geographic
market
definitions
were
accepted
in
full.
the
second
trouble
is
that
the
trial
court
did
in
fact
make
the
structural
analysis
which
the
government
claims
is
missing
and
did
so
in
conformity
with
the
cases.
almost
one
third
of
the
opinion
below
is
devoted
to
such
considerations
as
the
rankings
of
the
defendants
in
both
coal
production
and
coal
reserves,
the
background
of
the
coal
industry,
the
changes
in
the
demand
for
coal,
the
emergence
of
the
utilities
as
the
principle
market
for
coal,
the
changes
that
had
taken
place
in
production
techniques,
the
way
in
which
coal
producers
competed
for
their
principle
market
utilities
and
indeed
one
section
of
the
opinion
is
even
titled,
“changes
in
the
structure
of
the
coal
industry,”
are
over
read,
that
four
point
of
judge
robinson’s
opinion
he
declares
that
coal
is
the
subject
of
a
litigation.
now,
what
the
government
really
complains
about,
we
submit
is
that
the
court
refuse
to
decide
the
case
solely
in
the
numbers
the
government
had
put
on
their
charts.
now,
even
if
these
numbers
had
been
something
more
than
improperly
aggregated
coal
production
statistics
which
they
were
decidedly
not,
it
seems
to
us
that
writing
numbers
on
the
blackboard
is
not
enough
in
the
present
case
where
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
government
has
made
out
of
prima
facie
case
but
whether
on
the
basis
of
all
the
evidence
after
a
full
trial,
a
likely
adverse
on
effect
on
competition
has
been
shown.
even
where
the
statistical
data
and
evidence
is
not
misleading,
this
court
has
stressed
in
brown
shoe
that
its
important
should
not
obscure
that
only
a
further
examination
of
the
particular
market,
its
structure,
history,
probable
future
and
provide
the
appropriate
setting
for
judging
the
probable
anticompetitive
effect
of
the
merger.
square
to
the
point
here
is
the
testimony
at
trail
of
the
government’s
own
economist,
james
fulsome.
but
during
the
litigation,
it
came
to
our
attention
that
while
the
antitrust
division
was
trying
to
split
up
the
united
electric
and
freeman,
they
were
acting
affirmatively
at
the
same
time
to
approve
a
merger
of
two
other
illinois
coal
producers
that
would
have
been
structurally
indistinguishable
from
united
electric-freeman
with
the
resulting
combination
in
either
situation
constituting
the
second
largest
coal
producer
in
illinois
and
in
the
midwest.
now,
at
trial,
i
submitted
to
mr.
fulsome
a
hypothetical
based
solely
upon
the
structural
numbers
of
the
merger
which
the
government
said
it
would
approve.
i
asked
him
to
assume
that
the
two
companies
were
buyable
and
i
asked
him
whether
he
would
conclude
on
the
basis
of
those
facts
that
the
merger
posed
a
threat
to
competition.
mr.
fulsome
was
not
prepared
to
rest
an
appraisal
on
the
numbers
alone
as
he
quoted,
“i
would
still
want
more
information.
i
would
still
want
to
look
further.”
so
in
this
case,
if
the
government’s
numbers
did
anything
at
all
and
we
say
they
didn’t,
in
view
of
among
other
things,
they
are
improper
aggregation.
the
fact
that
production
data
rather
than
reserved
data
was
used
and
the
fact
that
even
then,
they
included
non-competing
forms
of
coal,
they
created
at
most
of
presumption
that
was
rebutted
and
overcome
by
the
facts
which
defendants
placed
in
evidence.
with
commonwealth
edison
testifying
that
they
have
put
their
eggs
in
the
nuclear
basket,
with
the
documented
loss
of
coal’s
position
in
other
markets,
were
the
undisputed
fact
that
a
coal
producer
competes
for
long-term
contracts
not
with
production’s
statistics
but
with
verifiable
uncommitted
coal
reserves
and
with
the
government’s
own
economist
challenging
the
use
of
the
eastern
interior
coal
province
sale’s
area
as
a
market
and
failing
to
support
the
proposition
that
illinois
was
a
market,
we
submit
that
the
trial
court
was
undoubtedly
correct
in
its
finding
at
page
65a.
that
the
only
evidence
produced
by
the
government
to
support
their
claim
of
a
substantial
lessening
of
competition
was
statistics
which
fail
to
reflect
the
very
real
competition
coal
faces
from
other
forms
of
energy
and
which
proofs
together
coal
producers
and
to
economically
unrealistic
markets
while
ignoring
the
key
factor
in
a
coal
producer’s
market
strength,
coal
reserves.
the
government’s
remaining
and
we
submit
late
arriving
argument
also
fails.
if
there’d
be
any
significance,
and
we
say
there
is
none,
that
the
fact
that
judge
robinson
entered
no
specific
findings
with
respect
to
united
electric’s
prospects
of
1959.
it
is
because
government
trial
counsel
not
only
failed
to
request
such
findings
but
asked
the
trial
court
not
to
make
them.
however,
defendants
did
propose
findings
on
evidence
that
they
had
put
in
the
record
concerning
united
electric’s
debilitated
condition
in
1959,
the
reasons
why
that
unhappy
circumstance
had
come
about
and
the
merger
efforts
of
united
before
1959
to
try
solve
the
problem.
in
the
face
of
the
lack
of
evidence
to
the
contrary,
however,
all
the
government
could
claim
at
trial
was
that
those
findings
were
irrelevant.
if
i
may
make
a
few
more
specific
comments
to
certain
other
things
that
mr.
friedman
touched
on
as
far
as
the
state
of
the
record.
i
would
suggest
a
careful
look
at
the
government’s
exhibit
on
mergers
since
1959,
that’s
at
--
that’s
at
page
106,
i
believe.
a
careful
analysis
of
that
will
show
that
almost
all
of
the
mergers
since
1959
have
involved
the
peabody
coal
company
as
i've
already
referred
to
and
that
another
rather
large
looking
one
on
the
record
was
in
fact
an
acquisition
of
an
existing
company
in
the
midwest
from
a
company
outside
the
midwest.
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
douglas’
observation
about
a
fuel
monopoly
--
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
a
question
sir.
there
is
a
reference
or
at
least
an
aspect
of
that
in
judge
robinson’s
opinion
in
which
he
does
note
that
25%
of
the
production
of
coal
in
the
midwest
has
been
produced
by
oil
companies.
general
dynamics
of
course
has
no
other
fuel
interest
or
utility
interest
for
that
matter,
other
than
these
two
coal
companies.
as
to
whether
ayrshire’s
attempt
to
deep
mining
proves
that
anybody
can
go
into
deep
mining,
i
would
respectfully
refer
the
court
to
the
testimony
of
ayrshire’s
witness
at
trial
on
that
subject
and
it
was
--
we
submit,
for
square
against
the
government.
as
far
as
general
dynamics
reserve
position,
a
coal
reserve
position
in
the
midwest
or
elsewhere
in
the
country,
that
has
not
changed
except
as
a
result
of
small
increments
of
the
two
coal
companies
involved
since
1959.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
yes,
mr.
justice.
the
competition
for
commonwealth
edison
has
to
be
viewed
it
seems
to
us
in
three
lights.
the
first
of
which
is
that
commonwealth
edison
is
a
unique,
unique
coal
purchaser
in
the
midwest.
it
purchases
one
third
of
all
the
production
in
the
state
of
illinois,
for
example.
unlike
any
other
coal
purchaser
revealed
by
either
the
government
or
ourselves,
it
must
buy
coal
from
a
variety
of
producing
districts.
we
believe
that
the
real
competition
then
for
edison’s
coal
purchasers
is
among
the
producers
in
a
district
and
not
between
different
districts.
secondly,
in
view
of
edison's
substantial
size,
their
world
leading
commitment
to
nuclear
energy,
the
sophistication
and
care
with
which
that
company
makes
every
fuel
decision
that
it
--
we
do
not
think
that
this
combination
could
have
any
effect
on
commonwealth
edison
as
indeed
was
confirmed
by
their
witness
at
trial.
a
dimension
of
these
i
think,
mr.
justice
powell
is
that
the
government’s
request
or
at
haste
to
point
out
i
should
say
at
trial
that
commonwealth
edison
does
not
take
unfair
advantage
of
coal
producers.
mr.
reuben
l.
hedlund
yes,
your
honor.
those
are
--

defendant’s
exhibit

i'm
sorry
not

defendant’s
exhibit

well,
that
discloses
only
the
producing
districts.
the
actual
names
of
the
customers,
i
do
not
think
it
is
shown,
but
i
could
be
wrong.
to
conclude,
we
submit
that
the
decision
below
comports
completely
with
settled
principles
of
merger
law
and
policy
and
signals
no
softening
out
or
a
retreat
from
established
barriers
to
anticompetitive
mergers.
the
findings
below,
we
submit
were
not
clearly
erroneous
and
we
respectfully
urge
that
the
judgment
be
affirmed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
that
would
conclude
my
argument.
