justice
potter
stewart
that
was
in
1959?
justice
potter
stewart
i
just
--
i’m
not
--
you
went
a
little
fast
for
me.
justice
potter
stewart
material
was
the
dominant
stockholder
in
freeman?
justice
potter
stewart
was
the
sole
stockholder
of
freeman?
justice
potter
stewart
and
freeman
began
acquiring
electric’s
stock?
justice
potter
stewart
material
not
freeman?
justice
potter
stewart
and
did
so
beyond
the
--
during
the
period
between
54
and
59
in
which
time
it
had
acquired
something
over
30%?
justice
potter
stewart
and
at
that
time,
the
--
now
you’re
just
starting
to
tell
that
the
operations
director
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
other
66%
of
the
stock
of
electric
in
1959
was
broadly
held
or
held
out?
justice
potter
stewart
through
--
directly
or
through
freeman?
justice
potter
stewart
so
then,
freeman
owned
34%
of
the
stock
and
general
dynamics
began
from
zero.
justice
potter
stewart
the
number
of
shares
and
began
building
up
its
ownership?
justice
potter
stewart
but
freeman
owned
the
34%?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know,
but
there
was
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
had
--
when
in
the
government’s
view
was
the
acquisition
then
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
know
it
it
is
and
therefore,
you
can’t
say
well,
it
was
in
1959,
it
was
also
in
1967?
justice
potter
stewart
the
date
is
quite
important,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
who,
not
--
the
general
dynamics
wasn’t
there
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
now,
is
there
any
dispute
between
the
parties
to
this
case,
(a)
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
an
acquisition
within
the
meaning
of
section
7
and
(b)
as
to
when
that
acquisition
took
place?
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
read
your
brief,
you
kept
getting
an
alternative,
59
(r)
of
1966,
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
dates
can
be
rather
critical.
justice
potter
stewart
but
you
think
there
may
not
be
agreement
between
you
and
your
brothers
on
that.
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
these
customers
being
electric
utilities
primarily?
justice
potter
stewart
on
page
62-9.
justice
potter
stewart
as
i
understand
your
argument,
it
runs
exactly
counter
to
the
suggestions
contained
in
the
question
of
my
brother
douglas,
because
the
district
court
thought
that
the
relevant
market
was
the
energy
market,
and
you
said
that
he
was
quite
wrong
and
that
he
should
have
confined
himself
with
--
to
coal
alone.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
say
--
you
say
that
was
quite
erroneous
that
he
should
--
that
the
relevant
market
is
coal.
justice
potter
stewart
and
specifically
and
within
the
geographic
market
of
the
eastern
interior
coal
products?
justice
potter
stewart
which
is
what,
one
of
five
or
four
provinces?
justice
potter
stewart
one
of
the
findings
that
you
have
just
reviewed
was
the
acquisition
took
place
in
1959
and
you
accept
that
argument,
i
would
think
so?
justice
potter
stewart
but
now
the
government
agrees
with
you.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
my
earlier
questions
were
a
red
herring
type.
i
mean,
they're
not
--
there’s
no
distinction
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
an
incredible
plea
for
judicial
notice?
justice
potter
stewart
and
what
are
--
what
--
justice
potter
stewart
what
--
why
do
they
hesitate
to
judicial
--
to
judicially
know?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
united
states
district
court
of
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
the
government
commenced
this
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
that
district,
challenging
as
violative
of
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
the
acquisition
of
the
stock
of
united
electrical
coal
companies
by
material
service
corporation
and
its
successor
general
dynamics
corporation.
after
lengthy
discovery
proceedings,
a
trial
was
held
for
more
than
three
weeks
in
the
spring
of
1970
and
in
1972
the
district
court
issued
an
opinion
and
judgment,
finding
no
violation
of
the
clayton
act.
the
government
appealed
directly
to
this
court
pursuant
to
the
expediting
act
and
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
in
its
long
and
thorough
opinion,
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
evidence
did
not
support
the
government's
contention
that
the
effect
of
the
acquisition
might
be
substantially
to
lessen
competition
in
any
line
of
commerce,
in
any
section
of
the
country.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
some
detail
in
the
written
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
this
conclusion
of
the
district
court
was
not
erroneous
and
we
accordingly
affirm
the
judgment
before
us.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
mr.
justice
brennan,
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
marshall
have
joined.
the
view
expressed
in
the
dissenting
opinion
is
that
the
district
court
did
not
make
the
findings
necessary
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
acquisition
violated
section
7
and
that
the
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
district
court
so
that
these
findings
can
be
laid.
justice
