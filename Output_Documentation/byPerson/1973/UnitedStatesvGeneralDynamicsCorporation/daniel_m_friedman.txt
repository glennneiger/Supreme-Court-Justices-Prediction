mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
which
at
the
trial
dismissed
a
government
civil
anti-trust
case,
challenging
the
combination
of
two
large
coal
companies
in
illinois
as
violating
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
as
is
true
in
most
of
these
merger
cases,
the
issues
relate
to
the
proper
definition
of
the
relevant
product
in
geographic
markets
and
then
the
final
question
whether
within
those
markets
the
effect
of
the
merger
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
the
two
companies
involved
are
the
freeman
coal
company
which
in
effect
is
the
acquiring
company
and
the
united
electric
coal
company
which
is
the
acquired
company.
there
was
not
a
direct
acquisition
of
one
company
by
the
other,
however,
the
acquisition
came
about
in
this
fashion.
since
1942,
a
firm
called
material
service
company
which
was
primarily
in
the
building
trade
in
material
business
owned
all
of
the
stock
of
the
freeman
coal
company.
beginning
in
1954,
the
material
service
company
started
to
acquire
stock
of
the
united
electric,
the
acquired
company,
and
by
1959,
it
had
acquired
34%
of
the
stock
of
united
electric.
at
that
time,
the
president
of
freeman
became
the
chief
executive
officer
of
united
electric,
and
at
the
same
time,
five
new
members
of
the
board
where
appointed
to
united
electric
for
them
being
people
connected
with
freeman
and
material
service.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
was
in
1959.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
am
sorry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
material
owned
all
of
freeman’s
since
1942.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
sole
stockholder.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
united
--
material
service.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right,
begun
acquiring
united
electric
stock
in
1954.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
with
34%.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
at
that
time,
the
president
of
freeman
became
the
chief
--
the
head
of
the
executive
committee
of
the
united
electric
and
there
was
a
shift
in
the
board
of
directors.
it
was
a
9-man
board.
five
new
members
where
appointed
to
the
board,
four
of
whom
were
directly
connected
with
either
material
service
or
freeman.
that
is
the
company
of
companies
that
had
control.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
medium
broadly
held.
some,
it
was
held
i
think
by
a
controllers,
but
i’ll
come
to
that
in
a
minute
as
to
what
happened.
but,
i
want
to
stress
the
fact
that
both
of
the
expert
economists
in
this
case,
both
the
government’s
expert
and
the
appellee's
expert
testified
that
as
a
result
of
these
events
in
1959,
material
service
then
obtained
control
of
united
electric.
now,
the
next
step
in
this
somewhat
complicated
series
of
transactions
took
place
a
few
months
later
in
1959
when
the
appellee,
general
dynamics
corporation
acquired
all
the
stock
of
material
service,
and
as
result
of
that
acquisition,
it
in
turn
got
34%
of
the
stock
of
united
electric.
general
dynamics
then
continued
to
acquire
the
stock
of
united
electric
and
by
1967
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe
directly.
i
think
it
has
been
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
from
zero,
but
general
dynamics
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
general
dynamics
of
course
indirectly
owned
all
of
freeman
through
material
service.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
freeman
owned
the
34%,
but
of
course
at
that
point
on,
general
dynamics
had
complete
control
of
freeman.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i’m
sorry,
i’m
sorry,
material,
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
freeman
did
not
own
any
of
the
stock
of
the
--
and
it’s
my
understanding
that
the
stock
after
general
dynamics
was
acquired
control
of
material
service,
it
was
then
general
dynamics
that
in
turn
proceeded
to
acquire
more
united
electric
stock.
until
in
1966,
it
had
together
with
the
34%
owned
by
material
service,
roughly
two-thirds
of
the
stock
of
united
electric.
at
that
point
in
1966,
general
dynamics
made
a
tender
offer
for
the
balance
of
united
electric
stock,
it
got
all
of
it.
in
the
following
year,
1967,
united
electric
became
through
a
corporate
merger,
and
wholly
own
subsidiary
of
general
dynamics.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
say
the
acquisition
was
for
--
in
1959,
but
we
say
moreover
the
acquisition
continued
to
be
solidified
up
until
1967,
but
we
think
1960
--
1959
was
the
acquisition
and
that
as
i
will
develop
is
an
important
factor
in
connection
with
the
clients
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
think
it
was
in
1959.
there’s
a
dispute
as
to
that,
but
we
think
its
just
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is,
yes
mr.
justice
and
we
think
in
1959,
there
was
an
acquisition
cause
there's
a
practical
matter,
has
shown
what
happened,
they
got
control
of
the
company.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
united
electric
got
them.
i’m
sorry,
material
services
got
control
of
united
electric
and
as
result
of
material
service
wholly
owned
freeman,
this
in
effect
at
that
point
resulted
in
a
combination
and
the
kind
of
acquisition
which
section
7
was
direct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
--
i
don’t
believe
mr.
justice
that
they’d
challenged
that
there
was
an
acquisition.
i
think,
i’m
not
certain
they
may
disagree
that
the
acquisition
took
place
in
1959.
i’m
not
sure
of
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
--
i
think
mr.
justice
of
--
after
further
study
of
the
case,
we
would
say
the
acquisition
did
take
place
in
1959.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
there
may
not.
mr.
hedlund
will
have
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
1969
--
i
am
sorry,
1967,
in
september
1967.
now,
there
are
in
the
united
states
four
major
coal
producing
areas,
and
the
one
that
we’re
concerned
with
in
this
case
is
an
area
in
the
midwest,
which
we
refer
to
as
the
eastern
interior
coal
province,
a
phrase
that
is
derived
from
the
descriptions
in
the
u.s.
geological
survey
maps.
it
consists
of
central
and
southern
illinois,
parts
of
western
indiana
and
western
kentucky.
all
of
the
mines
of
both
of
these
companies
are
not
only
located
in
the
provinces
i
shall
refer
to
it,
but
in
central
and
southern
illinois.
both
of
these
companies,
freeman
and
united
electric
are
old
and
substantial
companies.
freeman
got
its
first
coal
mine
in
1922.
in
the
year
1959,
it
produced
about
7
million
tons
that
had
revenues
of
$32
million.
all
of
freeman’s
coal
is
mined
from
deep
mines.
they
put
shafts
down
and
mine
the
coal
out
of
the
deep,
out
of
the
ground.
united
electric
is
even
older.
it
was
formed
in
1919
and
in
1959
it
had
production
of
3.5
million
tons,
sales
of
$15
million.
united
electric
has
been
an
extremely
profitable
company.
it
had
profits
in
1959
of
$1.8
million,
and
it
has
one
of
the
highest
profit
margins
of
any
company
in
the
coal
business.
it,
unlike
freeman
is
engaged
only
in
strip
mining.
it
digs
a
hole.
it
takes
a
side
of
a
mound
and
pulls
the
coal
out
without
going
deep
down
into
the
ground
with
the
shafts
associated
with
deep
mining.
there
had
been
some
rather
dramatic
changes
in
the
coal
industry
since
world
war
ii.
after
world
war
ii,
the
coal
industry
lost
its
entire
railroad
business
which
at
one
point
had
been
its
mainstay
to
diesel
oil.
in
addition,
there
was
a
sharp
trend
away
from
the
use
of
coal
in
household
heating
and
in
many
industrial
uses.
and
in
the
7
years
from
1947
to
1954,
the
production
of
coal
in
this
country
dropped
sharply,
more
than
a
third.
but
since
1954,
coal
has
made
a
substantial
comeback
as
a
fuel
due
primarily
to
the
tremendous
market
it
has
been
able
to
develop
with
the
electric
utility
interests.
and
as
there’s
been
a
great
expansion
in
the
production
of
electric
power
in
the
last
20
years
or
so,
so
has
the
production
of
coal
increased
and
the
result
is
by
1967
and
1968,
the
production
was
almost
back
to
the
post
war
1947
level.
now,
most
of
the
coal
that
is
sold
to
the
electric
utilities
is
sold
under
long-term
contract,
usually
five
to
10
years,
some
of
them
longer.
and
in
addition,
when
a
utility
is
planning
to
install
a
large
generating
station,
which
is
going
to
call
for
a
substantial
amount
of
coal
over
the
life
of
the
generating
station,
it
insists
quite
understandably
that
the
utility
be
able
to
be
certain
of
an
adequate
supply
of
coal
from
the
coal
company
before
it
will
sign
the
contract.
that
is,
the
coal
company
has
to
satisfy
it,
that
it
has
adequate
reserves.
now,
let
me
speak
briefly
of
the
reserves
because
that
is
a
critical
issue
in
the
case.
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
in
1959,
united
electric
had
81
million
tons
of
strip
reserves
and
27
million
tons
of
deep
reserves,
a
total
of
slightly
more
than
100
million
tons.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
all
in
the
state
of
illinois
mr.
justice,
all
in
the
state
of
illinois.
the
record
shows
that
since
that
time,
most
of
these
strip
reserves
have
been
committed,
although,
they
still
have
what
we
consider
substantial
strip
reserves
at
this
time.
they
also
--
after
that
time
acquired
about
50
million
tons
in
deep
reserves
which
have
not
been
mined.
now,
when
we
talk
of
reserves,
the
description
of
them,
they’re
always
spoken
of
as
being
economically
minable
or
economically
recoverable.
what
is
meant
by
that
is
that
they
treat
as
reserves
coal
which
with
the
present
level
of
technology
and
the
present
price
structure
of
coal
can
be
taken
out
of
the
ground
and
sold
at
a
profit.
of
course,
as
we
know,
what
maybe
economically
minable
today
--
may
not
be
economically
minable
today
may
turn
out
to
be
economically
minable
next
year.
techniques
for
example
have
improved
remarkably
in
strip
mining.
coal
that
20
years
ago
was
considered
far
too
deep
to
get
out
of
the
ground
can
now
be
extracted
with
new
modern
machinery.
we’re
all
familiar
with
the
energy
crisis
today.
it
seems
not
unreasonable
that
as
other
fuels,
fossil
fuels
becomes
scarce,
efforts
will
be
made
to
mine
coal
that
hitherto
has
been
considered
not
economically
minable,
and
it
may
well
be
that
as
the
price
of
coal
goes
up,
the
reserves
that
were
once
considered
rather
hopeless
will
suddenly
take
a
new
lease
on
the
life.
in
addition
to
that,
coal
people
tend
to
be
rather
concern
of
estimating
their
reserves,
and
the
former
president
of
the
united
electric,
mr.
colby
testify
that
every
strip
mine
that
they
open
in
fact
turned
out
to
have
more
reserves
than
they
had
estimated.
that
statement
is
at
page
144
of
the
record.
now,
let
me
just
describe
briefly
the
situation
within
both
the
eastern
interior
coal
province
and
the
state
of
illinois
and
i
should
add,
i’ll
come
to
it
in
few
minutes,
the
government
alleged
in
this
case
that
there
were
two
relevant
markets.
one
was
the
state
of
illinois,
the
other
is
what
we
called
the
eastern
interior
coal
province
sales
area,
which
is
an
area
comprising
eight
states
contiguous
to
and
surrounding
the
province.
the
production
of
coal
in
both
the
province
and
in
the
state
of
illinois
is
today
highly
concentrated.
now,
we’ve
set
forth
at
page
6
of
our
brief
a
table
giving
the
statistics.
i
will
not
repeat
them
here
because
there's
a
lot
of
statistics,
but
the
fact
is
that
a
relatively
small
number
producers
have
the
major
share
of
coal
production
in
these
two
areas.
in
the
same
period
from
1957
to
1967
--
oh!
let
me
come
back,
one
thing,
in
saying,
these
tables
we
have
in
the
brief
also
show
that
from
1957
to
1967
concentration
increased.
in
the
same
period,
the
actual
number
of
producers
of
coal
in
the
state
of
illinois
dropped
73%
from
a
144
to
39.
now,
it’s
quite
true
as
the
appellees
point
out
that
many
of
these
coal
producers
disappeared
because
there
were
small
producers
whose
mines
were
exhausted
or
lost
their
markets.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
an
exhibit
in
the
record
at
pages
101
to
106
of
what
we
call
the
exhibit
appendices.
there
are
some
eight-volume
printed
appendix
before
this
court.
the
transcript
portions
and
the
exhibit
portions
of
separately
paginate
and
at
pages
101
to
106,
there
is
an
exhibit
showing
that
21
or
22
independent
coal
mines
in
the
province
were
absorbed
through
merger
from
1905
to
1968.
now
within
these
two
concentrated
markets,
the
province
and
the
state
of
illinois,
freeman
and
united
electric
each
had
significant
shares.
again,
we
have
a
detailed
table
at
page
58
of
our
brief,
giving
these
figures.
freeman
was
the
second
largest
coal
producer
in
both
the
province
and
the
state.
it
had
7%
of
production
in
the
province
and
14%
on
the
state.
united
electric
was
the
6th
largest
in
the
province,
the
8th
largest
in
illinois.
it
had
4.5%
of
the
production
in
the
province
and
8%
of
the
production
in
illinois.
the
record
also
shows
that
freeman
and
united
electric
sell
approximately
half
of
their
production
to
common
customers,
and
the
major
portion
of
that
half
of
their
production
is
sold
to
the
same
facilities
of
the
same
customer.
that
is
each
of
them
sells
coal
to
the
same
plant
of
the
same
customer
and
the
record
also
shows
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mainly
primarily
electric
utilities.
there's
a
few
heavy
industry,
there's
some
cement
plants
but
mainly
electric
utility.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
is
not
mr.
justice.
united
--
let
me
explain
the
situation
on
that.
united
electric
does
not
produce
any
metallurgical
coal.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
freeman
produces
approximately
8%
of
its
product
is
metallurgical
coal.
but
the
major
share,
the
overwhelming
share
of
united
--
freeman’s
production
is
coal
that
is
used
for
the
same
basic
purpose
as
united
electric,
that
is
as
a
fuel
to
produce
heat,
largely
boiler
fuel
for
electric
utility.
the
record
also
shows
that
even
at
the
present
time,
salesmen
from
both
united
electric
and
freeman
continue
to
solicit
the
same
customers,
and
the
testimony
is
they
did
that
before
the
merger,
as
well
as
after.
in
dismissing
the
government’s
complaint,
the
district
court
basically
made
three
holdings.
first,
the
district
court
said
the
relevant
market
in
this
case
is
not
coal
as
the
government
contended,
but
a
broader
category
which
it
described
is
the
energy
market,
that
is
an
addition
to
coal.
the
district
court
said,
“you
have
to
take
account
of
oil,
natural
gas
and
nuclear
power.”
secondly,
the
district
court
said
that
the
government’s
two
proposed
geographical
markets,
the
eastern
interior
province
sales
area
and
the
state
of
illinois
where
as
it
described
in
unrealistic,
and
instead
the
district
court
proposed,
suggested
they
should
be
10
different
geographic
markets
which
the
defendants
had
proposed.
we
have
set
them
out
in
this
colored
diagram,
opposite
page
48
of
our
brief.
and
in
this
diagram,
each
--
that
special
color
is
a
single
geographic
market
according
to
the
district
court.
the
way
these
10
markets
where
determined
is
as
follows.
there
are
four
freight
rate
districts
within
the
state
of
illinois
and
under
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
freight
regulation,
all
mines
in
a
single
freight
district
had
the
same
freight
rate
to
a
single
facility.
so,
the
court
said,
“we
will
take
each
of
these
separate
freight
rate
districts
and
treat
that
as
a
separate
section
of
the
country.”
but
then,
the
district
court
did
not
include
in
the
single
freight
rate
all
utility
and
non-utility
customers.
the
district
court
broke
it
up
and
said
one
market
is
the
utility
customers
in
the
freight
rate
district,
another
market
is
the
non-utility
customers.
the
district
court
excluded,
however,
from
these
four
freight
rate
districts,
the
largest
customer
of
both
companies
which
is
commonwealth
edison
to
which
each
of
them
sells
approximately
25%
of
its
production
and
said
that
the
commonwealth
edison
plants
constituted
a
separate
geographic
market.
those
are
showed
in
the
little
black
dots
in
our
map
and
rather
interestingly
one
of
them
is
in
one
of
the
freight
rate
geographic
markets,
another
one
is
in
the
second
in
the
chicago
market
which
is
the
last
market
and
another
one
is
in
the
third
one
and
three
of
them
are
not
in
any
market.
and
finally,
the
court
said
that
the
chicago
air
pollution
controlled
district
in
which
they
are
certain
special
requirements
impose
with
respect
to
avoiding
pollution,
limitations
on
the
kind
of
fuels
you
can
burn
and
so
on,
that
was
a
separate
geographic
market.
and
then
the
court
went
on
and
said
that
in
any
event,
if
you
look
at
these
markets
and
it
said
even
accepting
the
government’s
mark,
the
result
will
be
the
same,
said
there
was
no
adverse
effect
on
competition.
the
rationale
of
that
decision
was
basically
two
or
three-fold.
first,
the
court
said
that
united's
reserves
are
presently
committed
and
the
government
hasn’t
shown
that
there
where
any
economically
minable
strip
coal
reserves
that
united
could
acquire.
it
pointed
out
--
the
court
pointed
out
that
united
electric
having
all
is
been
in
the
strip
mining
business
did
not
have
the
necessary
skills
it
said
to
go
into
the
deep
mining
business.
and
therefore,
you
couldn’t
consider
united
electric’s
deep
mines
as
reflecting
any
potentiality
to
engage
in
meaningful
competition
in
the
coal
business.
and
then
the
court
finally
said
that
if
you
--
united
electric
and
freeman
is
complementary
rather
than
competitive,
apparently,
and
when
reads
the
opinion,
the
theory
seems
to
be
a
game
because
one
is
a
strip
mine
firm
and
the
other
is
a
deep
coal
mine.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
the
kind
of
--
it
is
a
kind
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
some
of
that
--
but
it
doesn’t
--
the
court
doesn’t
say
that
exactly.
what
the
court
says
at
page
61
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
where
the
opinion
is
repeated,
what
the
court
says
is,
“this
companies
have
been
and
are
now
predominantly
complimentary
in
nature.
united
electric
is
a
strip
mining
company
with
no
experience
in
deep
mining
or
likelihood
of
acquiring
it.
freeman
is
a
deep
mining
company
with
no
experience
or
expertise
in
strip
mining.”
and
then
he
goes
on
and
then
he
says
“freeman
sells
metallurgical
coal.
united
electric
does
not
encounter.”
now
again
as
i
have
indicated
my
answer
to
justice
powell’s
question,
freeman
sales
of
metallurgical
coal
are
a
very
small
portion
of
its
output.
freeman
sales
a
byproduct
known
as
dust,
which
is
primarily
in
front
of
your
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
disagree
with
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
a
flat
finding,
but
our
basic
answer
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don’t
think
--
i
don’t
think
so
mr.
justice.
let
me
explain
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
don’t
think
so.
we
don’t
think
so
mr.
justice.
let
me
explain
the
reason
why
we
don’t
think
so.
we
think
that
the
proper
approach
in
these
cases,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
is
to
consider
the
structure
of
the
market,
consider
the
structure
of
the
market
to
see
what
happens,
what
happens
in
the
market.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think,
i
think
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
mr.
justice,
he
is
using
--
when
he
says
these
sales
are
not
competitive,
he
uses
it
in
a
very,
very
narrow
sense,
not
as
we
define
competition
within
the
meaning
of
section
7.
what
he
is
saying
is
that,
he
looks
and
says
here
were
20,000
tons
of
shipped
to
this
plant
and
30,000
ton
shipped
to
this
plant
and
these
are
not
competitive
because
if
there
had
been
separate
companies,
obviously,
the
one
wouldn’t
have
sold
to
the
other.
we
think
that’s
not
the
kind
of
competition
to
which
the
protections
of
section
7
are
restricted.
what
we’re
dealing
with
here
is
two
large
firms.
each
of
which
is
trying
to
sell
its
coal
in
the
area,
and
that
it
seems
to
us
is
the
critical
thing
and
the
critical
thing
about
this
merger.
the
vice
of
this
merger
we
think
is
that
this
is
taken
in
a
concentrated
market,
where
there’s
an
increasing
tend
towards
concentration.
this
has
resulted
in
a
substantial
increase
in
the
concentration.
and
that
we
think
the
teachings
of
this
court
have
indicate
that
is
enough,
that
is
enough
to
make
the
merger
prima
facie
illegal,
unless
there
is
some
justification.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
the
court
could
reverse
on
the
market
definitions
and
remand
for
the
district
court
to
consider
the
case
further
in
the
light
of
those,
we
would
think,
however,
since
there
is
a
full
record
before
this
court
and
since
the
basic
facts
on
which
we
base
our
case
are
really
not
disputed.
we
think
it
would
be
appropriate
as
the
court
has
done
in
many
other
cases
if
it
finds
there
are
errors
in
the
definition
of
the
relevant
markets
to
then
go
on
and
decide
the
competitive
issue
in
the
case.
let
me
address
myself
a
bit
to
--
let
me
just
say
one
other
thing,
if
i
may.
in
the
last
statement,
the
end
of
the
district
court’s
opinion
at
pages
65
to
66
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
just
before
the
very
end
of
it,
he
says,
“under
the
circumstance
that
all
the
mine
reserves
had
been
sold
and
united
electric
has
needed
the
possibility
of
acquiring
more
than
of
the
ability
to
develop
deep
coal
reserves,
under
these
circumstances,
continuation
of
the
affiliation
between
united
electric
and
freeman
is
not
adverse
to
competition
nor
would
divestiture
benefit
competition
even
were
this
court
to
accept
the
government’s
unrealistic
product
and
geographic
market
definitions.
it
seems
to
us
to
what
the
court
is
saying
here
is
basically,
he
doesn’t
--
the
court
doesn’t
think
that
divestiture
relief
is
appropriate
or
that
the
divestiture
relief
would
in
any
way
improve
competition.
that
it
seems
to
us
is
putting
the
cart
very
definitely
before
the
horse
because
before
you
decide
what
is
an
appropriate
remedy
in
a
case,
you
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
merger
violates
section
7,
whether
its
effect
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competitions.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there’s
no
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don’t
think
so
mr.
justice.
what
we
do
have
i
think
is
that
we
have
the
coal
business,
that
the
coal
business
here,
we
think
is
controlled,
that
there
is
an
ologopolistic
type
of
market,
we
have
this
relatively
small
number
of
producers
that
own
most
of
the
coal
and
produce
most
of
the
coals.
in
addition
to
that,
we
do
have
evidence
relating
to
the
competition
between
coal,
oil
and
natural
gas,
nuclear
power
and
so
on
that
the
different
types
of
fuel.
but
i
--
there’s
no
claim
here
that
there’s
any
sort
of
combined
monopoly
involving
different
types
of
energy.
our
case
here
is
directed
against
the
situation
in
the
coal
industry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
not
--
no.
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice.
what
--
there
is
evidence
is
that
in
recent
years,
some
of
the
large
oil
companies
have
gone
into
the
coal
business
for
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don’t
know
how
many,
but
we
know
there’s
a
substantial
number.
now,
we
do
know
for
example,
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
is
significant,
the
argument
has
been
made
here
that
united
electric
because
it’s
a
strip
mining
company
couldn’t
possibly
mine
any
of
its
deep
mines.
in
1958
or
1959,
a
subsidiary
of
the
humble
oil
company,
which
is
a
very
large
company
opened
a
deep
mine.
humble
oil
company
had
never,
had
never
been
in
the
coal
mining
business
at
all.
it
was
able
to
acquire
the
skills
and
open
the
large
deep
mine
and
expects
to
produce
i
think
3
million
tons
a
year,
and
has
entered
into
a
contract
to
sell
this
coal
at
the
large
utilities.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
but
i
feel
it
mr.
--
i
am
sorry,
i
have
been
perhaps
i
misunderstood
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not,
no.
i
think
what
the
district
court
did
was
the
district
court
concluded
that
because
there
is
obviously
competition
among
these
different
forms
of
energy
and
selling
to
the
utilities,
he
concluded
therefore,
you
should
evaluate
the
impact
of
this
merger
in
this
broader
energy
market.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right.
well,
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
modify
that
mr.
justice.
we
say
that
there
maybe
an
energy
market
in
some
types
of
mergers,
but
we
say
that
coal
is
an
alternative
market.
there
is
--
i
think
the
teachings
of
this
court
have
indicated
there
is
utility
--
no
single
relevant
product
market.
there
maybe
product
markets
and
sub-markets,
and
we
think
that
coal
under
the
practical
indicia
test
announced
in
brown
shoe
that
coal
is
a
relevant
sub-market
within
which
to
measure
the
impact
of
this
merger
upon
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
and
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
for
example,
if
we
had
a
merger
between
an
oil
company,
a
natural
gas
company
and
a
coal
company,
the
energy
market
might
be
the
relevant
market.
all
that
we
say
is
that
whether
or
not
there
is
an
energy
market,
there
is
an
addition
to
that,
a
coal
market
and
that
a
coal
market
is
a
relevant
market
within
which
to
determine
the
effect
upon
competition
of
the
merger
of
these
two
coal
companies.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
coal
and
sales
area,
and
the
state
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
are
four
--
there
are
basically
four
provinces,
and
we
have
gone
beyond
the
province
to
include
a
slightly
broader
area
which
is
where
the
vast
majority
of
coal
produced
in
the
province
is
sold.
we
say
that
within
that
and
the
state
of
illinois
is
the
geographic
markets
and
viewing
the
relevant
market
for
this
case
as
coal
that
within
that
market,
this
merger
does
meet
the
standards
that
this
court
has
developed
in
a
large
number
of
cases
to
determine
prima
facie,
the
anti-competitive
effect.
now,
the
basic
answer
that
was
given
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
and
was
given
by
our
opponents
here
is
that
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
united
electric
really
isn’t
a
viable
competitor
at
all.
they
say
united
electric
as
of
the
time
of
trial
was
about
to
exhaust
its
resources,
united
electric
had
almost
all
of
its
strip
mines
committed.
the
united
electric
doesn’t
have
the
capacity
to
mine
the
deep
coal,
and
therefore,
it's
here,
they
say
the
disappearance
of
united
electric
through
merger
could
not
possibly
substantially
lessen
competition.
this
it
seems
to
us
is
basically
another
version
of
the
traditional
failing
company
defense.
in
the
traditional
failing
company
defense,
the
company
is
failing
because
of
its
lack
of
financial
resources.
it’s
about
to
go
under
economically.
here,
the
claim
is
that
the
company
is
about
to
go
under
resourcefully.
it
doesn’t
have
any
resources.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
defense
has
to
be
tested
by
the
same
standards
that
the
--
by
which
the
court
has
tested
the
failing
company
defense,
and
the
reason
is
that
it’s
fundamentally
the
same
claim.
it’s
fundamentally
the
claim
that
although
it
might
appear
on
its
face
that
an
acquisition
substantially
lessens
competition
because
of
the
change
it
makes
in
the
structure
of
the
market.
in
fact,
it
really
doesn’t
because
if
there
hadn’t
been
the
merger,
the
acquired
company
would’ve
disappeared
from
the
market
anyhow
in
a
short
time,
and
therefore,
the
fact
that
it
disappears
as
a
result
of
a
merger
rather
than
through
the
operation
of
natural
economic
forces
can’t
be
viewed
a
substantially
lessening
competition.
we
think
this
argument
is
fallacious
for
several
reasons.
the
first
of
which
is
that
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
the
validity
of
this
defense
must
be
tested
as
the
time
--
as
of
the
time
of
the
merger
because
the
question
is
whether
as
of
the
time
of
the
merger,
the
effect
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition,
and
you
have
look
and
see
whether
the
removal
of
this
firm
by
merger
had
an
adverse
competitive
effect
on
the
basis
of
what
it’s
position
was
when
it
disappeared
from
the
market
and
therefore,
we
think
that
the
critical
time
was
of
1959.
as
of
1959,
it’s
certainly
cannot
be
said
that
the
condition
of
this
company’s
resources
was
so
depleted
and
so
hopeless
that
it
couldn’t
possibly
continue
for
any
significant
period.
at
that
time,
united
electric
had
substantial
reserves
of
strip
coal.
there’s
nothing
to
indicate
at
that
that
time,
all
of
those
reserves
were
committed.
there’s
an
indication
that
since
that
time,
other
firms
had
acquired
strip
reserves,
but
more
important
than
that,
more
important
than
that,
it’s
just
impossible
at
this
time
on
the
basis
of
hindsight,
14
years
later
to
say
what
united
electric
would
have
done
if
united
electric
had
remained
an
independent
firm.
how
it
would
have
solved
its
problems?
we
do
know
for
example,
the
record
shows
that
another
formerly
large
strip
mining
firm,
ayrshire
collieries,
since
that
time,
although
it
had
been
--
had
no
deep
coal
experience,
first
acquired
two
small
mines,
with
that
experience,
opened
a
large
mine
which
has
been
operating
for
11
years.
the
appellees
point
out
that
the
mine
was
spectacularly
unsuccessful.
it
lost
money
nine
of
the
11
years.
the
testimony,
however,
is
not
that
it
lost
money
because
they
did
not
know
how
to
operate
the
mine,
but
because
the
mine
was
a
bad
one,
the
roofing
wasn’t
right
and
the
man
said
frankly,
we
sold
the
coal
for
too
little
money.
it
can’t
fairly
be
said
and
we
also
have
the
experience
of
humble
going
into
deep
mining,
i
don’t
think
it
can
fairly
be
said
now
that
if
united
electric
had
remained
independent,
it
could
not
possibly
either
have
obtained
additional
reserves
or
that
it
could
not
have
acquired
the
skills
for
deep
mining.
of
course,
it
has
the
skills
for
selling
and
marketing
coal.
that’s
what
its
business
is.
it’s
in
the
coal
business.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
strip
reserves
or
deep
reserves?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don’t
--
i’m
not
certain
mr.
justice,
but
freeman
of
course
had
a
very
large;
much
greater
reserves
than
united
electric
at
the
time
of
this
--
the
acquisition.
but
i
would
say
--
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
that
the
whole
history
of
extractive
industries
in
america
is
that
you
have
a
problem.
if
you’re
an
industry
where
you’re
taking
--
using
up
your
raw
materials
and
have
to
go
out
and
acquire
--
they
did
after
around
1959
or
1960,
united
electric
did
acquire
this
very
large
deep
mine.
and
also
the
testimony
is
that
after
1959,
the
united
electric
was
willing
to
acquire
more
reserves,
but
they
only
wanted
to
pay
farm
prices
for
them.
and
that
is,
they
would
buy
a
land
with
strip
reserves
at
the
price
as
one
would
ordinarily
pay
for
farmland.
now,
we
don’t
know
what
an
independent
united
electric
would've
done.
it
might
have
concluded
that
it
was
willing
to
pay
more
for
this
land.
it
might
have
decided
it
had
to
buy
it.
all
that
i
am
suggesting
is
--
it
can
--
i
don’t
think
it
can
fairly
be
said
at
this
point
of
time
that
if
united
electric
had
remained
independent,
it
would
have
found
no
way
to
solve
its
problems.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
understand
so.
i
don’t
have
the
exact
figures.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
so.
the
record
is
huge
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
have
looked
through
the
3,500
pages,
frankly,
i
haven’t
been
able
to
check
every
exhibit.
but,
i’m
told
by
my
colleague
who
tried
the
case
that
the
record
does
show
and
i
think
it’s
a
fair
assumption
it'd
be
somewhere
in
the
17,000
pages
of
record,
there
are
statistics
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
let
me
say
mr.
justice,
there’s
an
exhibit
in
the
record
that
shows
that
united
electric
was
a
very
prosperous
company.
it
kept
increasing
its
profits.
it
paid
substantial
dividends
to
general
dynamics
during
the
period
that
general
dynamics
controlled
it.
it
paid
off
all
of
its
long-term
debt.
it
might
have
had
--
it
might
have
--
it
might
have
found
it
more
difficult
than
general
dynamics
to
acquire
coal,
but
again,
we
do
not
know.
we
just
can’t
say,
and
since
section
7
was
dealing
with
probabilities,
not
with
certainties
but
probabilities,
it
condemns
mergers
that
--
where
the
effect
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
now,
let
me
just
say
one
other
thing
with
respect
to
this
failing
company
or
failing
resources
defense.
this
court
in
both
the
citizen
publishing
case
and
in
the
newspaper
case,
the
comics,
greater
buffalo
press
has
said
that
among
other
things,
for
this
defense
to
be
available,
you
have
to
show
that
the
firm
to
whom
the
property
was
sold
was
the
only
available
purchaser.
there’s
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
united
electric
could
have
sold
its
property
or
disposed
off
its
property
only
to
freeman
or
material
service.
the
initiative
for
this
transaction
did
not
come
from
united
electric.
united
electric
according
to
the
record
has
nothing
to
show
that
it
approached
material
service
and
said
we’re
in
trouble,
will
you
take
us
out?
on
the
contrary,
the
initiative
came
from
material
service,
which
looked
and
saw
this
is
an
attractive
company
and
it
frankly
said
it
was
attractive
because
it
recognized
that
its
resources
were
dwindling,
freeman
had
large
resources
and
therefore,
it
would
seem
like
an
attractive
opportunity
for
it
to
combine
its
resources
with
this
company.
and
nor
is
there
any
indication
in
this
record
that
united
electric
made
other
attempts
to
solve
its
problems
such
as
seeing
if
someway
couldn’t
be
worked
out
to
get
this
coal,
this
deep
coal
out
of
the
ground.
and
we
think
that
the
appellees
have
not,
have
not
made
the
kind
of
showing
that
this
court
has
said
is
necessary
before
a
failing
company
or
failing
resources
defense
can
be
sustained.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
now,
the
government
doesn’t
see
this
as
basically
a
factual
case.
our
opponents
have
attempted
to
present
this
as
a
case
in
which
the
district
court
fully
considered
all
the
factual
issues
resolved
and
against
the
government
and
therefore
as
they
see
it
that’s
the
end
of
it.
we
think
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
traditional
standards
that
this
court
has
applied
in
passing
upon
the
validity
of
mergers
under
section
7,
an
analysis
of
the
structure
of
the
industry
where
the
prime
emphasis
in
on
increases
in
concentration
in
the
concentrated
market
where
congress
has
made
the
judgment
that
increases
in
concentration
or
distressing
the
trend
in
the
american
economy
that
should
be
halted
in
their
incipiency.
whether
the
principles
this
court
as
announced
in
those
cases
are
somehow
not
applicable
to
this
industry
because
of
the
critical
aspect
of
the
reserves
in
this
industry
and
because
of
the
weak
position
united
electric
was
developing
in
its
reserves
and
we
think
the
whole
question
of
whether
united
electric
continued
as
a
viable
entity
in
this
industry
has
to
depend
upon
whether
they’ve
succeeded
in
establishing
this
failing
company
or
failing
resources
defense.
we
think
you
can’t
just
say
because
it
looked
as
though
united
electric
in
1959
would
have
some
troubles
surviving,
therefore,
you
jettison
all
the
analysis
that
this
court
has
made
in
the
past
on
this
issue
and
merely
say,
it's
there
for
a
factual
question
that
we
let
the
district
court
decide
whether
in
the
district
court
by
the
way
did
make
these
decisions
as
of
1959,
the
time
of
the
merger,
it
made
them
as
of
the
time
of
trial,
i
would
say
presently.
whether
we
let
the
district
court
say
that
nevertheless
this
merger
is
to
be
approved
because
on
the
basis
of
the
record,
it
concluded
that
in
1972,
1972
that
united
electric
was
unlikely
at
that
point
to
consider
as
a
viable
entity
and
that
the
divestiture
would
be
inappropriate
thing.
a
suggestion
has
been
here
that,
well,
are
really
the
coal
industry
is
terribly
competitive.
everyone
is
competing
for
business,
people
are
fighting
to
get
business,
that’s
not
the
standard
for
determining
the
validity
of
a
merger
under
section
7.
what
congress
was
concerned
with
was
changes
in
the
structure
of
the
industry.
not
where
the
people
were
vigorously
competing.
i
dare
say
there's
a
--
there
are
few
industries,
i
think
more
competitive,
more
competitive
than
the
retail
grocery
industry
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
industry,
the
retail
grocery
industry
in
los
angeles
where
this
court
held
a
merge
of
bonds
and
shopping
bag
illegal
was
at
least
as
competitive
as
the
coal
industry
involved
in
illinois.
if
anything,
it
was
probably
more
competitive,
but
that
didn’t
change
the
court’s
decision.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
is
a
direct
appeal
from
an
order
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
illinois
which
at
the
trial
dismissed
a
government
civil
anti-trust
case,
challenging
the
combination
of
two
large
coal
companies
in
illinois
as
violating
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
as
is
true
in
most
of
these
merger
cases,
the
issues
relate
to
the
proper
definition
of
the
relevant
product
in
geographic
markets
and
then
the
final
question
whether
within
those
markets
the
effect
of
the
merger
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
the
two
companies
involved
are
the
freeman
coal
company
which
in
effect
is
the
acquiring
company
and
the
united
electric
coal
company
which
is
the
acquired
company.
there
was
not
a
direct
acquisition
of
one
company
by
the
other,
however,
the
acquisition
came
about
in
this
fashion.
since
1942,
a
firm
called
material
service
company
which
was
primarily
in
the
building
trade
in
material
business
owned
all
of
the
stock
of
the
freeman
coal
company.
beginning
in
1954,
the
material
service
company
started
to
acquire
stock
of
the
united
electric,
the
acquired
company,
and
by
1959,
it
had
acquired
34%
of
the
stock
of
united
electric.
at
that
time,
the
president
of
freeman
became
the
chief
executive
officer
of
united
electric,
and
at
the
same
time,
five
new
members
of
the
board
where
appointed
to
united
electric
for
them
being
people
connected
with
freeman
and
material
service.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
was
in
1959.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
am
sorry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
material
owned
all
of
freeman’s
since
1942.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
sole
stockholder.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
united
--
material
service.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right,
begun
acquiring
united
electric
stock
in
1954.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
with
34%.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
at
that
time,
the
president
of
freeman
became
the
chief
--
the
head
of
the
executive
committee
of
the
united
electric
and
there
was
a
shift
in
the
board
of
directors.
it
was
a
9-man
board.
five
new
members
where
appointed
to
the
board,
four
of
whom
were
directly
connected
with
either
material
service
or
freeman.
that
is
the
company
of
companies
that
had
control.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
medium
broadly
held.
some,
it
was
held
i
think
by
a
controllers,
but
i’ll
come
to
that
in
a
minute
as
to
what
happened.
but,
i
want
to
stress
the
fact
that
both
of
the
expert
economists
in
this
case,
both
the
government’s
expert
and
the
appellee's
expert
testified
that
as
a
result
of
these
events
in
1959,
material
service
then
obtained
control
of
united
electric.
now,
the
next
step
in
this
somewhat
complicated
series
of
transactions
took
place
a
few
months
later
in
1959
when
the
appellee,
general
dynamics
corporation
acquired
all
the
stock
of
material
service,
and
as
result
of
that
acquisition,
it
in
turn
got
34%
of
the
stock
of
united
electric.
general
dynamics
then
continued
to
acquire
the
stock
of
united
electric
and
by
1967
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
believe
directly.
i
think
it
has
been
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
from
zero,
but
general
dynamics
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
but
general
dynamics
of
course
indirectly
owned
all
of
freeman
through
material
service.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
freeman
owned
the
34%,
but
of
course
at
that
point
on,
general
dynamics
had
complete
control
of
freeman.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i’m
sorry,
i’m
sorry,
material,
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
freeman
did
not
own
any
of
the
stock
of
the
--
and
it’s
my
understanding
that
the
stock
after
general
dynamics
was
acquired
control
of
material
service,
it
was
then
general
dynamics
that
in
turn
proceeded
to
acquire
more
united
electric
stock.
until
in
1966,
it
had
together
with
the
34%
owned
by
material
service,
roughly
two-thirds
of
the
stock
of
united
electric.
at
that
point
in
1966,
general
dynamics
made
a
tender
offer
for
the
balance
of
united
electric
stock,
it
got
all
of
it.
in
the
following
year,
1967,
united
electric
became
through
a
corporate
merger,
and
wholly
own
subsidiary
of
general
dynamics.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
say
the
acquisition
was
for
--
in
1959,
but
we
say
moreover
the
acquisition
continued
to
be
solidified
up
until
1967,
but
we
think
1960
--
1959
was
the
acquisition
and
that
as
i
will
develop
is
an
important
factor
in
connection
with
the
clients
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
think
it
was
in
1959.
there’s
a
dispute
as
to
that,
but
we
think
its
just
the
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is,
yes
mr.
justice
and
we
think
in
1959,
there
was
an
acquisition
cause
there's
a
practical
matter,
has
shown
what
happened,
they
got
control
of
the
company.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no.
united
electric
got
them.
i’m
sorry,
material
services
got
control
of
united
electric
and
as
result
of
material
service
wholly
owned
freeman,
this
in
effect
at
that
point
resulted
in
a
combination
and
the
kind
of
acquisition
which
section
7
was
direct.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
--
i
don’t
believe
mr.
justice
that
they’d
challenged
that
there
was
an
acquisition.
i
think,
i’m
not
certain
they
may
disagree
that
the
acquisition
took
place
in
1959.
i’m
not
sure
of
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes
--
i
think
mr.
justice
of
--
after
further
study
of
the
case,
we
would
say
the
acquisition
did
take
place
in
1959.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
there
may
not.
mr.
hedlund
will
have
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
in
1969
--
i
am
sorry,
1967,
in
september
1967.
now,
there
are
in
the
united
states
four
major
coal
producing
areas,
and
the
one
that
we’re
concerned
with
in
this
case
is
an
area
in
the
midwest,
which
we
refer
to
as
the
eastern
interior
coal
province,
a
phrase
that
is
derived
from
the
descriptions
in
the
u.s.
geological
survey
maps.
it
consists
of
central
and
southern
illinois,
parts
of
western
indiana
and
western
kentucky.
all
of
the
mines
of
both
of
these
companies
are
not
only
located
in
the
provinces
i
shall
refer
to
it,
but
in
central
and
southern
illinois.
both
of
these
companies,
freeman
and
united
electric
are
old
and
substantial
companies.
freeman
got
its
first
coal
mine
in
1922.
in
the
year
1959,
it
produced
about
7
million
tons
that
had
revenues
of
$32
million.
all
of
freeman’s
coal
is
mined
from
deep
mines.
they
put
shafts
down
and
mine
the
coal
out
of
the
deep,
out
of
the
ground.
united
electric
is
even
older.
it
was
formed
in
1919
and
in
1959
it
had
production
of
3.5
million
tons,
sales
of
$15
million.
united
electric
has
been
an
extremely
profitable
company.
it
had
profits
in
1959
of
$1.8
million,
and
it
has
one
of
the
highest
profit
margins
of
any
company
in
the
coal
business.
it,
unlike
freeman
is
engaged
only
in
strip
mining.
it
digs
a
hole.
it
takes
a
side
of
a
mound
and
pulls
the
coal
out
without
going
deep
down
into
the
ground
with
the
shafts
associated
with
deep
mining.
there
had
been
some
rather
dramatic
changes
in
the
coal
industry
since
world
war
ii.
after
world
war
ii,
the
coal
industry
lost
its
entire
railroad
business
which
at
one
point
had
been
its
mainstay
to
diesel
oil.
in
addition,
there
was
a
sharp
trend
away
from
the
use
of
coal
in
household
heating
and
in
many
industrial
uses.
and
in
the
7
years
from
1947
to
1954,
the
production
of
coal
in
this
country
dropped
sharply,
more
than
a
third.
but
since
1954,
coal
has
made
a
substantial
comeback
as
a
fuel
due
primarily
to
the
tremendous
market
it
has
been
able
to
develop
with
the
electric
utility
interests.
and
as
there’s
been
a
great
expansion
in
the
production
of
electric
power
in
the
last
20
years
or
so,
so
has
the
production
of
coal
increased
and
the
result
is
by
1967
and
1968,
the
production
was
almost
back
to
the
post
war
1947
level.
now,
most
of
the
coal
that
is
sold
to
the
electric
utilities
is
sold
under
long-term
contract,
usually
five
to
10
years,
some
of
them
longer.
and
in
addition,
when
a
utility
is
planning
to
install
a
large
generating
station,
which
is
going
to
call
for
a
substantial
amount
of
coal
over
the
life
of
the
generating
station,
it
insists
quite
understandably
that
the
utility
be
able
to
be
certain
of
an
adequate
supply
of
coal
from
the
coal
company
before
it
will
sign
the
contract.
that
is,
the
coal
company
has
to
satisfy
it,
that
it
has
adequate
reserves.
now,
let
me
speak
briefly
of
the
reserves
because
that
is
a
critical
issue
in
the
case.
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
in
1959,
united
electric
had
81
million
tons
of
strip
reserves
and
27
million
tons
of
deep
reserves,
a
total
of
slightly
more
than
100
million
tons.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
all
in
the
state
of
illinois
mr.
justice,
all
in
the
state
of
illinois.
the
record
shows
that
since
that
time,
most
of
these
strip
reserves
have
been
committed,
although,
they
still
have
what
we
consider
substantial
strip
reserves
at
this
time.
they
also
--
after
that
time
acquired
about
50
million
tons
in
deep
reserves
which
have
not
been
mined.
now,
when
we
talk
of
reserves,
the
description
of
them,
they’re
always
spoken
of
as
being
economically
minable
or
economically
recoverable.
what
is
meant
by
that
is
that
they
treat
as
reserves
coal
which
with
the
present
level
of
technology
and
the
present
price
structure
of
coal
can
be
taken
out
of
the
ground
and
sold
at
a
profit.
of
course,
as
we
know,
what
maybe
economically
minable
today
--
may
not
be
economically
minable
today
may
turn
out
to
be
economically
minable
next
year.
techniques
for
example
have
improved
remarkably
in
strip
mining.
coal
that
20
years
ago
was
considered
far
too
deep
to
get
out
of
the
ground
can
now
be
extracted
with
new
modern
machinery.
we’re
all
familiar
with
the
energy
crisis
today.
it
seems
not
unreasonable
that
as
other
fuels,
fossil
fuels
becomes
scarce,
efforts
will
be
made
to
mine
coal
that
hitherto
has
been
considered
not
economically
minable,
and
it
may
well
be
that
as
the
price
of
coal
goes
up,
the
reserves
that
were
once
considered
rather
hopeless
will
suddenly
take
a
new
lease
on
the
life.
in
addition
to
that,
coal
people
tend
to
be
rather
concern
of
estimating
their
reserves,
and
the
former
president
of
the
united
electric,
mr.
colby
testify
that
every
strip
mine
that
they
open
in
fact
turned
out
to
have
more
reserves
than
they
had
estimated.
that
statement
is
at
page
144
of
the
record.
now,
let
me
just
describe
briefly
the
situation
within
both
the
eastern
interior
coal
province
and
the
state
of
illinois
and
i
should
add,
i’ll
come
to
it
in
few
minutes,
the
government
alleged
in
this
case
that
there
were
two
relevant
markets.
one
was
the
state
of
illinois,
the
other
is
what
we
called
the
eastern
interior
coal
province
sales
area,
which
is
an
area
comprising
eight
states
contiguous
to
and
surrounding
the
province.
the
production
of
coal
in
both
the
province
and
in
the
state
of
illinois
is
today
highly
concentrated.
now,
we’ve
set
forth
at
page
6
of
our
brief
a
table
giving
the
statistics.
i
will
not
repeat
them
here
because
there's
a
lot
of
statistics,
but
the
fact
is
that
a
relatively
small
number
producers
have
the
major
share
of
coal
production
in
these
two
areas.
in
the
same
period
from
1957
to
1967
--
oh!
let
me
come
back,
one
thing,
in
saying,
these
tables
we
have
in
the
brief
also
show
that
from
1957
to
1967
concentration
increased.
in
the
same
period,
the
actual
number
of
producers
of
coal
in
the
state
of
illinois
dropped
73%
from
a
144
to
39.
now,
it’s
quite
true
as
the
appellees
point
out
that
many
of
these
coal
producers
disappeared
because
there
were
small
producers
whose
mines
were
exhausted
or
lost
their
markets.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
an
exhibit
in
the
record
at
pages
101
to
106
of
what
we
call
the
exhibit
appendices.
there
are
some
eight-volume
printed
appendix
before
this
court.
the
transcript
portions
and
the
exhibit
portions
of
separately
paginate
and
at
pages
101
to
106,
there
is
an
exhibit
showing
that
21
or
22
independent
coal
mines
in
the
province
were
absorbed
through
merger
from
1905
to
1968.
now
within
these
two
concentrated
markets,
the
province
and
the
state
of
illinois,
freeman
and
united
electric
each
had
significant
shares.
again,
we
have
a
detailed
table
at
page
58
of
our
brief,
giving
these
figures.
freeman
was
the
second
largest
coal
producer
in
both
the
province
and
the
state.
it
had
7%
of
production
in
the
province
and
14%
on
the
state.
united
electric
was
the
6th
largest
in
the
province,
the
8th
largest
in
illinois.
it
had
4.5%
of
the
production
in
the
province
and
8%
of
the
production
in
illinois.
the
record
also
shows
that
freeman
and
united
electric
sell
approximately
half
of
their
production
to
common
customers,
and
the
major
portion
of
that
half
of
their
production
is
sold
to
the
same
facilities
of
the
same
customer.
that
is
each
of
them
sells
coal
to
the
same
plant
of
the
same
customer
and
the
record
also
shows
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mainly
primarily
electric
utilities.
there's
a
few
heavy
industry,
there's
some
cement
plants
but
mainly
electric
utility.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
it
is
not
mr.
justice.
united
--
let
me
explain
the
situation
on
that.
united
electric
does
not
produce
any
metallurgical
coal.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
freeman
produces
approximately
8%
of
its
product
is
metallurgical
coal.
but
the
major
share,
the
overwhelming
share
of
united
--
freeman’s
production
is
coal
that
is
used
for
the
same
basic
purpose
as
united
electric,
that
is
as
a
fuel
to
produce
heat,
largely
boiler
fuel
for
electric
utility.
the
record
also
shows
that
even
at
the
present
time,
salesmen
from
both
united
electric
and
freeman
continue
to
solicit
the
same
customers,
and
the
testimony
is
they
did
that
before
the
merger,
as
well
as
after.
in
dismissing
the
government’s
complaint,
the
district
court
basically
made
three
holdings.
first,
the
district
court
said
the
relevant
market
in
this
case
is
not
coal
as
the
government
contended,
but
a
broader
category
which
it
described
is
the
energy
market,
that
is
an
addition
to
coal.
the
district
court
said,
“you
have
to
take
account
of
oil,
natural
gas
and
nuclear
power.”
secondly,
the
district
court
said
that
the
government’s
two
proposed
geographical
markets,
the
eastern
interior
province
sales
area
and
the
state
of
illinois
where
as
it
described
in
unrealistic,
and
instead
the
district
court
proposed,
suggested
they
should
be
10
different
geographic
markets
which
the
defendants
had
proposed.
we
have
set
them
out
in
this
colored
diagram,
opposite
page
48
of
our
brief.
and
in
this
diagram,
each
--
that
special
color
is
a
single
geographic
market
according
to
the
district
court.
the
way
these
10
markets
where
determined
is
as
follows.
there
are
four
freight
rate
districts
within
the
state
of
illinois
and
under
the
interstate
commerce
commission's
freight
regulation,
all
mines
in
a
single
freight
district
had
the
same
freight
rate
to
a
single
facility.
so,
the
court
said,
“we
will
take
each
of
these
separate
freight
rate
districts
and
treat
that
as
a
separate
section
of
the
country.”
but
then,
the
district
court
did
not
include
in
the
single
freight
rate
all
utility
and
non-utility
customers.
the
district
court
broke
it
up
and
said
one
market
is
the
utility
customers
in
the
freight
rate
district,
another
market
is
the
non-utility
customers.
the
district
court
excluded,
however,
from
these
four
freight
rate
districts,
the
largest
customer
of
both
companies
which
is
commonwealth
edison
to
which
each
of
them
sells
approximately
25%
of
its
production
and
said
that
the
commonwealth
edison
plants
constituted
a
separate
geographic
market.
those
are
showed
in
the
little
black
dots
in
our
map
and
rather
interestingly
one
of
them
is
in
one
of
the
freight
rate
geographic
markets,
another
one
is
in
the
second
in
the
chicago
market
which
is
the
last
market
and
another
one
is
in
the
third
one
and
three
of
them
are
not
in
any
market.
and
finally,
the
court
said
that
the
chicago
air
pollution
controlled
district
in
which
they
are
certain
special
requirements
impose
with
respect
to
avoiding
pollution,
limitations
on
the
kind
of
fuels
you
can
burn
and
so
on,
that
was
a
separate
geographic
market.
and
then
the
court
went
on
and
said
that
in
any
event,
if
you
look
at
these
markets
and
it
said
even
accepting
the
government’s
mark,
the
result
will
be
the
same,
said
there
was
no
adverse
effect
on
competition.
the
rationale
of
that
decision
was
basically
two
or
three-fold.
first,
the
court
said
that
united's
reserves
are
presently
committed
and
the
government
hasn’t
shown
that
there
where
any
economically
minable
strip
coal
reserves
that
united
could
acquire.
it
pointed
out
--
the
court
pointed
out
that
united
electric
having
all
is
been
in
the
strip
mining
business
did
not
have
the
necessary
skills
it
said
to
go
into
the
deep
mining
business.
and
therefore,
you
couldn’t
consider
united
electric’s
deep
mines
as
reflecting
any
potentiality
to
engage
in
meaningful
competition
in
the
coal
business.
and
then
the
court
finally
said
that
if
you
--
united
electric
and
freeman
is
complementary
rather
than
competitive,
apparently,
and
when
reads
the
opinion,
the
theory
seems
to
be
a
game
because
one
is
a
strip
mine
firm
and
the
other
is
a
deep
coal
mine.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
it
is
the
kind
of
--
it
is
a
kind
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
some
of
that
--
but
it
doesn’t
--
the
court
doesn’t
say
that
exactly.
what
the
court
says
at
page
61
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
where
the
opinion
is
repeated,
what
the
court
says
is,
“this
companies
have
been
and
are
now
predominantly
complimentary
in
nature.
united
electric
is
a
strip
mining
company
with
no
experience
in
deep
mining
or
likelihood
of
acquiring
it.
freeman
is
a
deep
mining
company
with
no
experience
or
expertise
in
strip
mining.”
and
then
he
goes
on
and
then
he
says
“freeman
sells
metallurgical
coal.
united
electric
does
not
encounter.”
now
again
as
i
have
indicated
my
answer
to
justice
powell’s
question,
freeman
sales
of
metallurgical
coal
are
a
very
small
portion
of
its
output.
freeman
sales
a
byproduct
known
as
dust,
which
is
primarily
in
front
of
your
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
we
disagree
with
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that
is
a
flat
finding,
but
our
basic
answer
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don’t
think
--
i
don’t
think
so
mr.
justice.
let
me
explain
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
we
don’t
think
so.
we
don’t
think
so
mr.
justice.
let
me
explain
the
reason
why
we
don’t
think
so.
we
think
that
the
proper
approach
in
these
cases,
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
is
to
consider
the
structure
of
the
market,
consider
the
structure
of
the
market
to
see
what
happens,
what
happens
in
the
market.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well
i
think,
i
think
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
mr.
justice,
he
is
using
--
when
he
says
these
sales
are
not
competitive,
he
uses
it
in
a
very,
very
narrow
sense,
not
as
we
define
competition
within
the
meaning
of
section
7.
what
he
is
saying
is
that,
he
looks
and
says
here
were
20,000
tons
of
shipped
to
this
plant
and
30,000
ton
shipped
to
this
plant
and
these
are
not
competitive
because
if
there
had
been
separate
companies,
obviously,
the
one
wouldn’t
have
sold
to
the
other.
we
think
that’s
not
the
kind
of
competition
to
which
the
protections
of
section
7
are
restricted.
what
we’re
dealing
with
here
is
two
large
firms.
each
of
which
is
trying
to
sell
its
coal
in
the
area,
and
that
it
seems
to
us
is
the
critical
thing
and
the
critical
thing
about
this
merger.
the
vice
of
this
merger
we
think
is
that
this
is
taken
in
a
concentrated
market,
where
there’s
an
increasing
tend
towards
concentration.
this
has
resulted
in
a
substantial
increase
in
the
concentration.
and
that
we
think
the
teachings
of
this
court
have
indicate
that
is
enough,
that
is
enough
to
make
the
merger
prima
facie
illegal,
unless
there
is
some
justification.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
if
the
court
could
reverse
on
the
market
definitions
and
remand
for
the
district
court
to
consider
the
case
further
in
the
light
of
those,
we
would
think,
however,
since
there
is
a
full
record
before
this
court
and
since
the
basic
facts
on
which
we
base
our
case
are
really
not
disputed.
we
think
it
would
be
appropriate
as
the
court
has
done
in
many
other
cases
if
it
finds
there
are
errors
in
the
definition
of
the
relevant
markets
to
then
go
on
and
decide
the
competitive
issue
in
the
case.
let
me
address
myself
a
bit
to
--
let
me
just
say
one
other
thing,
if
i
may.
in
the
last
statement,
the
end
of
the
district
court’s
opinion
at
pages
65
to
66
of
the
jurisdictional
statement,
just
before
the
very
end
of
it,
he
says,
“under
the
circumstance
that
all
the
mine
reserves
had
been
sold
and
united
electric
has
needed
the
possibility
of
acquiring
more
than
of
the
ability
to
develop
deep
coal
reserves,
under
these
circumstances,
continuation
of
the
affiliation
between
united
electric
and
freeman
is
not
adverse
to
competition
nor
would
divestiture
benefit
competition
even
were
this
court
to
accept
the
government’s
unrealistic
product
and
geographic
market
definitions.
it
seems
to
us
to
what
the
court
is
saying
here
is
basically,
he
doesn’t
--
the
court
doesn’t
think
that
divestiture
relief
is
appropriate
or
that
the
divestiture
relief
would
in
any
way
improve
competition.
that
it
seems
to
us
is
putting
the
cart
very
definitely
before
the
horse
because
before
you
decide
what
is
an
appropriate
remedy
in
a
case,
you
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
merger
violates
section
7,
whether
its
effect
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competitions.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there’s
no
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don’t
think
so
mr.
justice.
what
we
do
have
i
think
is
that
we
have
the
coal
business,
that
the
coal
business
here,
we
think
is
controlled,
that
there
is
an
ologopolistic
type
of
market,
we
have
this
relatively
small
number
of
producers
that
own
most
of
the
coal
and
produce
most
of
the
coals.
in
addition
to
that,
we
do
have
evidence
relating
to
the
competition
between
coal,
oil
and
natural
gas,
nuclear
power
and
so
on
that
the
different
types
of
fuel.
but
i
--
there’s
no
claim
here
that
there’s
any
sort
of
combined
monopoly
involving
different
types
of
energy.
our
case
here
is
directed
against
the
situation
in
the
coal
industry.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
not
--
no.
i’m
sorry
mr.
justice.
what
--
there
is
evidence
is
that
in
recent
years,
some
of
the
large
oil
companies
have
gone
into
the
coal
business
for
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don’t
know
how
many,
but
we
know
there’s
a
substantial
number.
now,
we
do
know
for
example,
one
of
the
things
that
i
think
is
significant,
the
argument
has
been
made
here
that
united
electric
because
it’s
a
strip
mining
company
couldn’t
possibly
mine
any
of
its
deep
mines.
in
1958
or
1959,
a
subsidiary
of
the
humble
oil
company,
which
is
a
very
large
company
opened
a
deep
mine.
humble
oil
company
had
never,
had
never
been
in
the
coal
mining
business
at
all.
it
was
able
to
acquire
the
skills
and
open
the
large
deep
mine
and
expects
to
produce
i
think
3
million
tons
a
year,
and
has
entered
into
a
contract
to
sell
this
coal
at
the
large
utilities.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
yes.
but
i
feel
it
mr.
--
i
am
sorry,
i
have
been
perhaps
i
misunderstood
mr.
justice
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
not,
no.
i
think
what
the
district
court
did
was
the
district
court
concluded
that
because
there
is
obviously
competition
among
these
different
forms
of
energy
and
selling
to
the
utilities,
he
concluded
therefore,
you
should
evaluate
the
impact
of
this
merger
in
this
broader
energy
market.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
that’s
right.
well,
if
i
may
--
if
i
may
modify
that
mr.
justice.
we
say
that
there
maybe
an
energy
market
in
some
types
of
mergers,
but
we
say
that
coal
is
an
alternative
market.
there
is
--
i
think
the
teachings
of
this
court
have
indicated
there
is
utility
--
no
single
relevant
product
market.
there
maybe
product
markets
and
sub-markets,
and
we
think
that
coal
under
the
practical
indicia
test
announced
in
brown
shoe
that
coal
is
a
relevant
sub-market
within
which
to
measure
the
impact
of
this
merger
upon
competition.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
no,
and
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
for
example,
if
we
had
a
merger
between
an
oil
company,
a
natural
gas
company
and
a
coal
company,
the
energy
market
might
be
the
relevant
market.
all
that
we
say
is
that
whether
or
not
there
is
an
energy
market,
there
is
an
addition
to
that,
a
coal
market
and
that
a
coal
market
is
a
relevant
market
within
which
to
determine
the
effect
upon
competition
of
the
merger
of
these
two
coal
companies.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
coal
and
sales
area,
and
the
state
of
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
there
are
four
--
there
are
basically
four
provinces,
and
we
have
gone
beyond
the
province
to
include
a
slightly
broader
area
which
is
where
the
vast
majority
of
coal
produced
in
the
province
is
sold.
we
say
that
within
that
and
the
state
of
illinois
is
the
geographic
markets
and
viewing
the
relevant
market
for
this
case
as
coal
that
within
that
market,
this
merger
does
meet
the
standards
that
this
court
has
developed
in
a
large
number
of
cases
to
determine
prima
facie,
the
anti-competitive
effect.
now,
the
basic
answer
that
was
given
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
and
was
given
by
our
opponents
here
is
that
well,
as
a
practical
matter,
united
electric
really
isn’t
a
viable
competitor
at
all.
they
say
united
electric
as
of
the
time
of
trial
was
about
to
exhaust
its
resources,
united
electric
had
almost
all
of
its
strip
mines
committed.
the
united
electric
doesn’t
have
the
capacity
to
mine
the
deep
coal,
and
therefore,
it's
here,
they
say
the
disappearance
of
united
electric
through
merger
could
not
possibly
substantially
lessen
competition.
this
it
seems
to
us
is
basically
another
version
of
the
traditional
failing
company
defense.
in
the
traditional
failing
company
defense,
the
company
is
failing
because
of
its
lack
of
financial
resources.
it’s
about
to
go
under
economically.
here,
the
claim
is
that
the
company
is
about
to
go
under
resourcefully.
it
doesn’t
have
any
resources.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
this
defense
has
to
be
tested
by
the
same
standards
that
the
--
by
which
the
court
has
tested
the
failing
company
defense,
and
the
reason
is
that
it’s
fundamentally
the
same
claim.
it’s
fundamentally
the
claim
that
although
it
might
appear
on
its
face
that
an
acquisition
substantially
lessens
competition
because
of
the
change
it
makes
in
the
structure
of
the
market.
in
fact,
it
really
doesn’t
because
if
there
hadn’t
been
the
merger,
the
acquired
company
would’ve
disappeared
from
the
market
anyhow
in
a
short
time,
and
therefore,
the
fact
that
it
disappears
as
a
result
of
a
merger
rather
than
through
the
operation
of
natural
economic
forces
can’t
be
viewed
a
substantially
lessening
competition.
we
think
this
argument
is
fallacious
for
several
reasons.
the
first
of
which
is
that
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
the
validity
of
this
defense
must
be
tested
as
the
time
--
as
of
the
time
of
the
merger
because
the
question
is
whether
as
of
the
time
of
the
merger,
the
effect
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition,
and
you
have
look
and
see
whether
the
removal
of
this
firm
by
merger
had
an
adverse
competitive
effect
on
the
basis
of
what
it’s
position
was
when
it
disappeared
from
the
market
and
therefore,
we
think
that
the
critical
time
was
of
1959.
as
of
1959,
it’s
certainly
cannot
be
said
that
the
condition
of
this
company’s
resources
was
so
depleted
and
so
hopeless
that
it
couldn’t
possibly
continue
for
any
significant
period.
at
that
time,
united
electric
had
substantial
reserves
of
strip
coal.
there’s
nothing
to
indicate
at
that
that
time,
all
of
those
reserves
were
committed.
there’s
an
indication
that
since
that
time,
other
firms
had
acquired
strip
reserves,
but
more
important
than
that,
more
important
than
that,
it’s
just
impossible
at
this
time
on
the
basis
of
hindsight,
14
years
later
to
say
what
united
electric
would
have
done
if
united
electric
had
remained
an
independent
firm.
how
it
would
have
solved
its
problems?
we
do
know
for
example,
the
record
shows
that
another
formerly
large
strip
mining
firm,
ayrshire
collieries,
since
that
time,
although
it
had
been
--
had
no
deep
coal
experience,
first
acquired
two
small
mines,
with
that
experience,
opened
a
large
mine
which
has
been
operating
for
11
years.
the
appellees
point
out
that
the
mine
was
spectacularly
unsuccessful.
it
lost
money
nine
of
the
11
years.
the
testimony,
however,
is
not
that
it
lost
money
because
they
did
not
know
how
to
operate
the
mine,
but
because
the
mine
was
a
bad
one,
the
roofing
wasn’t
right
and
the
man
said
frankly,
we
sold
the
coal
for
too
little
money.
it
can’t
fairly
be
said
and
we
also
have
the
experience
of
humble
going
into
deep
mining,
i
don’t
think
it
can
fairly
be
said
now
that
if
united
electric
had
remained
independent,
it
could
not
possibly
either
have
obtained
additional
reserves
or
that
it
could
not
have
acquired
the
skills
for
deep
mining.
of
course,
it
has
the
skills
for
selling
and
marketing
coal.
that’s
what
its
business
is.
it’s
in
the
coal
business.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
of
strip
reserves
or
deep
reserves?
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
don’t
--
i’m
not
certain
mr.
justice,
but
freeman
of
course
had
a
very
large;
much
greater
reserves
than
united
electric
at
the
time
of
this
--
the
acquisition.
but
i
would
say
--
i
would
suggest
mr.
justice
that
the
whole
history
of
extractive
industries
in
america
is
that
you
have
a
problem.
if
you’re
an
industry
where
you’re
taking
--
using
up
your
raw
materials
and
have
to
go
out
and
acquire
--
they
did
after
around
1959
or
1960,
united
electric
did
acquire
this
very
large
deep
mine.
and
also
the
testimony
is
that
after
1959,
the
united
electric
was
willing
to
acquire
more
reserves,
but
they
only
wanted
to
pay
farm
prices
for
them.
and
that
is,
they
would
buy
a
land
with
strip
reserves
at
the
price
as
one
would
ordinarily
pay
for
farmland.
now,
we
don’t
know
what
an
independent
united
electric
would've
done.
it
might
have
concluded
that
it
was
willing
to
pay
more
for
this
land.
it
might
have
decided
it
had
to
buy
it.
all
that
i
am
suggesting
is
--
it
can
--
i
don’t
think
it
can
fairly
be
said
at
this
point
of
time
that
if
united
electric
had
remained
independent,
it
would
have
found
no
way
to
solve
its
problems.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
understand
so.
i
don’t
have
the
exact
figures.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
i
think
so.
the
record
is
huge
and
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
have
looked
through
the
3,500
pages,
frankly,
i
haven’t
been
able
to
check
every
exhibit.
but,
i’m
told
by
my
colleague
who
tried
the
case
that
the
record
does
show
and
i
think
it’s
a
fair
assumption
it'd
be
somewhere
in
the
17,000
pages
of
record,
there
are
statistics
--
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
well,
i
--
let
me
say
mr.
justice,
there’s
an
exhibit
in
the
record
that
shows
that
united
electric
was
a
very
prosperous
company.
it
kept
increasing
its
profits.
it
paid
substantial
dividends
to
general
dynamics
during
the
period
that
general
dynamics
controlled
it.
it
paid
off
all
of
its
long-term
debt.
it
might
have
had
--
it
might
have
--
it
might
have
found
it
more
difficult
than
general
dynamics
to
acquire
coal,
but
again,
we
do
not
know.
we
just
can’t
say,
and
since
section
7
was
dealing
with
probabilities,
not
with
certainties
but
probabilities,
it
condemns
mergers
that
--
where
the
effect
maybe
substantially
to
lessen
competition.
now,
let
me
just
say
one
other
thing
with
respect
to
this
failing
company
or
failing
resources
defense.
this
court
in
both
the
citizen
publishing
case
and
in
the
newspaper
case,
the
comics,
greater
buffalo
press
has
said
that
among
other
things,
for
this
defense
to
be
available,
you
have
to
show
that
the
firm
to
whom
the
property
was
sold
was
the
only
available
purchaser.
there’s
nothing
in
this
record
to
show
that
united
electric
could
have
sold
its
property
or
disposed
off
its
property
only
to
freeman
or
material
service.
the
initiative
for
this
transaction
did
not
come
from
united
electric.
united
electric
according
to
the
record
has
nothing
to
show
that
it
approached
material
service
and
said
we’re
in
trouble,
will
you
take
us
out?
on
the
contrary,
the
initiative
came
from
material
service,
which
looked
and
saw
this
is
an
attractive
company
and
it
frankly
said
it
was
attractive
because
it
recognized
that
its
resources
were
dwindling,
freeman
had
large
resources
and
therefore,
it
would
seem
like
an
attractive
opportunity
for
it
to
combine
its
resources
with
this
company.
and
nor
is
there
any
indication
in
this
record
that
united
electric
made
other
attempts
to
solve
its
problems
such
as
seeing
if
someway
couldn’t
be
worked
out
to
get
this
coal,
this
deep
coal
out
of
the
ground.
and
we
think
that
the
appellees
have
not,
have
not
made
the
kind
of
showing
that
this
court
has
said
is
necessary
before
a
failing
company
or
failing
resources
defense
can
be
sustained.
mr.
daniel
m.
friedman
mr.
chief
justice
may
it
please
the
court.
now,
the
government
doesn’t
see
this
as
basically
a
factual
case.
our
opponents
have
attempted
to
present
this
as
a
case
in
which
the
district
court
fully
considered
all
the
factual
issues
resolved
and
against
the
government
and
therefore
as
they
see
it
that’s
the
end
of
it.
we
think
the
basic
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
traditional
standards
that
this
court
has
applied
in
passing
upon
the
validity
of
mergers
under
section
7,
an
analysis
of
the
structure
of
the
industry
where
the
prime
emphasis
in
on
increases
in
concentration
in
the
concentrated
market
where
congress
has
made
the
judgment
that
increases
in
concentration
or
distressing
the
trend
in
the
american
economy
that
should
be
halted
in
their
incipiency.
whether
the
principles
this
court
as
announced
in
those
cases
are
somehow
not
applicable
to
this
industry
because
of
the
critical
aspect
of
the
reserves
in
this
industry
and
because
of
the
weak
position
united
electric
was
developing
in
its
reserves
and
we
think
the
whole
question
of
whether
united
electric
continued
as
a
viable
entity
in
this
industry
has
to
depend
upon
whether
they’ve
succeeded
in
establishing
this
failing
company
or
failing
resources
defense.
we
think
you
can’t
just
say
because
it
looked
as
though
united
electric
in
1959
would
have
some
troubles
surviving,
therefore,
you
jettison
all
the
analysis
that
this
court
has
made
in
the
past
on
this
issue
and
merely
say,
it's
there
for
a
factual
question
that
we
let
the
district
court
decide
whether
in
the
district
court
by
the
way
did
make
these
decisions
as
of
1959,
the
time
of
the
merger,
it
made
them
as
of
the
time
of
trial,
i
would
say
presently.
whether
we
let
the
district
court
say
that
nevertheless
this
merger
is
to
be
approved
because
on
the
basis
of
the
record,
it
concluded
that
in
1972,
1972
that
united
electric
was
unlikely
at
that
point
to
consider
as
a
viable
entity
and
that
the
divestiture
would
be
inappropriate
thing.
a
suggestion
has
been
here
that,
well,
are
really
the
coal
industry
is
terribly
competitive.
everyone
is
competing
for
business,
people
are
fighting
to
get
business,
that’s
not
the
standard
for
determining
the
validity
of
a
merger
under
section
7.
what
congress
was
concerned
with
was
changes
in
the
structure
of
the
industry.
not
where
the
people
were
vigorously
competing.
i
dare
say
there's
a
--
there
are
few
industries,
i
think
more
competitive,
more
competitive
than
the
retail
grocery
industry
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
industry,
the
retail
grocery
industry
in
los
angeles
where
this
court
held
a
merge
of
bonds
and
shopping
bag
illegal
was
at
least
as
competitive
as
the
coal
industry
involved
in
illinois.
if
anything,
it
was
probably
more
competitive,
but
that
didn’t
change
the
court’s
decision.
