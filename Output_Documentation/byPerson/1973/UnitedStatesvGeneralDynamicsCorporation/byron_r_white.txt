justice

all
in
this
area?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it’s
a
--
part
of
--
it
is
a
kind
of
coal
they
sell?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
kind
of
customers
they
have?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
this
--
excluding
commonwealth
that
is
none
of
the
sales
by
united
electric
in
the
two
year
--
in
the
critical
years
chosen
by
you
would
have
or
could’ve
been
competitive
with
freeman,
had
the
two
companies
been
independent?
how
about
that
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
a
flat
finding
though,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
are
we
going
to
--
use
it
--
must
we
turn
that
over
for
you
to
win?
justice
byron
r.
white
let’s
assume
you
took
that
--
let’s
assume
you
agreed
with
the
district
court
on
his
competitive,
no
competition
findings.
everything
that
he
said
you
agreed
with.
wouldn’t
it
--
wouldn't
it
almost
make
irrelevant
the
--
whatever
maybe
wrong
with
his
product
in
geographical
market?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that,
but
some
of
the
things
he
says
that
sort
--
primarily
on
competition.
it
wouldn’t
seem
to
me
to
make
much
difference.
what
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
you
looked
at
coal
as
the
market
like
you
suggest
that
you
would
still
arrive
at
his
conclusion
and
even
if
you
use
your
geographical
markets
to
derive
the
same
thing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that’s
--
lets
assume
we
agreed
with
you
that
the
court
erred
in
the
product
market.
the
coal
is
a
product
market.
would
the
court
have
to
get
to
deal
at
all
with
the
district
court's
views
about
affect
on
competition?
justice
byron

you
think
a
finding
of
that
--
the
--
that
the
--
this
merger
would
not
have
an
adverse
effect
on
competition
or
it’s
subject
to
that
--
clearly
erroneous?
justice

so,
your
answer
is
no?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
gather
your
--
one
of
your
arguments
must
be
that
as
a
--
in
terms
of
united’s
condition
in
1959,
anybody,
no
matter
who
the
acquirer
was
could
have
acquired
united
without
any
damaging
effect
on
competition
because
of
its
position
in
the
market.
that
it
was
just
too

competitively

be

in

case.
justice

well,
would
you
say
that
free

did
freeman
get
any
customers
through
united?
justice
byron

did
they
make
some
joint
bids?

did
they

did
freeman
help

carry
out

of

what
did
that
did
do
the
other
two
competitors?

whatever
the
competition,
the
two
other
competitors

one

the

who
might
wanted
to
to
get
that
utility
customer?

of
the
