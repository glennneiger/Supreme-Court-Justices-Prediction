justice
william
o.
douglas
as
i
read
this
record,
i
haven’t
gone
to
look
entirely
of
course,
but
i
get
the
impression
that
we
have
here
in
totality
whether
large
monopoly
--
a
fuel
monopoly,
oil
companies,
gas
companies,
owning
coal
companies
and
owning
uranium
companies,
is
that
right?
justice
william
o.
douglas
does
that
bear
from
this
problem
before
us?
justice
william
o.
douglas
that’s
not
affected
by
the
fact
that
if
this,
if
i
read
the
record
correctly,
there
is
a
monopoly
of
oil
and
gas
over
coal?
justice
william
o.
douglas
i
understand
25
of
them
have.
justice
william
o.
douglas
that’s
why
the
district
court
got
off
on
the
--
on
that
trail
of
the
(voice
overlap)
--
justice
william
o.
douglas
that
was
the
question.
