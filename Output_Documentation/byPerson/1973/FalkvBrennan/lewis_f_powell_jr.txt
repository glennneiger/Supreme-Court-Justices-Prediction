mr.
frey,
before
you
move
on
to
the
other
issue,
you
have
intimated
in
your
brief
argues
that
the
intent
of
congress
among
other
things
was
to
reach
enterprises
that
had
a
significant
impact
on
commerce.
and
as
i
read
your
brief
of
page
18
and
that
which
follows
your
general
discussion
suggests
to
me
that
you
may
think
that
if
this
rental
agent
didn’t
handle
these
30
apartment
units
that
the
impact
on
commerce
would
be
less.
is
that
correct?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

but
the
substance
really
is
the
effect
on
commerce
and
these
rental
units,
presumably,
would
be
rented
by
the
owners
whether
or
not
they
were
a
rental
agent?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

that
might
make
the
impact
less
rather
than
having
30
separate
people
who
purchased
the
supplies?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
in
terms
of
economic
reality,
the
impact
on
commerce
is
likely
to
be
pretty
much
the
same
you
said
in
the
rental
of
apartment
has
it?
