mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
begin
with
i’d
like
to
point
out
in
line
with
what
mr.
justice
blackmun
noted
earlier
that
both
of
the
issues
that
are
here
before
the
court
today,
have
been
before
four
different
courts
of
appeals.
and
in
each
instance,
there
have
been
unanimous
decisions
in
favor
of
the
government’s
position.
obviously,
in
the
case
below
in
the
fourth
circuit
on
both
issues
and
arnheim
&
neely
in
the
third
circuit
on
both
issues.
with
respect
to
the
rent
commissions
issue
in
the
first
national
bank
case
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
in
jernigan
case
in
the
fifth
circuit,
unanimous
decisions
holding
that
you
don’t
look
simply
at
the
commissions
that
are
earned
but
at
the
rentals
or
on
in
the
case
of
jernigan
the
ticket
sales
of
bus
tickets.
in
the
case
of
the
employment
issue,
you
have
the
second
circuit’s
decision
in
arsenal
building
and
you
have
rather
significant
decision
of
the
dc
circuit
in
the
herbert
harvey
case
which
i
will
get
to
when
i
discuss
the
employment
issue.
i’d
also
like
to
point
out
that
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
small
business.
drucker
&
falk
manages
30
apartment
projects
and
they
employ,
that
is,
they
hire,
supervise,
and
discharge
over
a
hundred
persons
in
connection
with
this
venture.
they
procure
annual
rentals
and
excess
of
eight
million
dollars.
we’re
not
talking
about
any
mom
and
pop
operation.
now,
taking
up
the
rent
and
commissions
issue
first,
i
have
no
difficulty
with
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
no
the
court
has
decided
in
arnheim
&
neely
that
the
management
company
conducts
a
single
enterprise
which
consists
of
its
building
management
operations.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
was
decided
in
arnheim
&
neely.
now,
the
question
on
the
rent
commission’s
issue
for
instance
is
how
do
you
determine
the
size?
how
do
you
measure
the
dollar
volume?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
would
rest
on
income
and
of
course,
that
is
very
significant
distinction
because
this
case
does
not
turn
in
any
way
on
the
enterprises
income.
the
congressional
test
was
not
put
on
the
basis
of
income.
for
on
the
basis
of
income,
penn
central
or
lockheed
or
people
like
would
not
have
to
pay
the
minimum
wage.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
income
would
of
course
be
the
commissions.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no
question
about
that,
but
that’s
not
the
statutory
standard
for
coverage.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
would
rest
on
the
sales.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not
at
all.
if
you
had
--
suppose
you
have
a
consignment
store
which
sell
goods
on
consignment
or
suppose
you
have
a
jeweler
which
usually
does
not
own
the
jewelry
that
they’re
selling
but
has
it
on
what's
called
on
memorandum
from
some
larger
jeweler.
when
he
sells
that,
he
collects
the
full
sales
tax
and
he
is
responsible
for
paying
that
full
sales
tax
to
the
taxing
department.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
collects
the
full
purchase
price
and
then
he
must
remit
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
portion
that
belongs
to
the
original
owner
of
the
piece
of
jewelry
or
the
consigned
merchandiser.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
suppose
that’s
true
but
in
any
event
income
is
not
standard.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it’s
gross
sale.
yes,
its
sales
that
made
a
business
stand.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
could
be,
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
that
could
be
also
--
i’ll
re-track
that.
i
don’t
think
it
matters
in
the
context
of
the
statute
with
which
we’re
dealing
here,
which
is
the
context
in
which
we
must
take
the
case.
now,
nobody
disputes
that
the
rental
of
properties
is
a
sale.
i
think
that’s
conceded.
the
question
then
is
who
is
it
who
makes
these
sales.
is
there
some
sense
in
which
we
can
say,
well
this
is
not
drucker
and
falk
sale,
this
is
building
owner’s
sale.
but
we
submit
that
--
first
of
all,
we
submit
that
you
don’t
have
to
divide
it
in
this
way.
you
don’t
have
to
say
either.
it’s
drucker
and
falk’s
sale
or
it
is
the
building
owner’s
sale
because
there
are
many
situations
as
with
the
consignment
sale
situation
where
both
parties
may
have
made
a
sale.
now,
in
this
case,
the
building
owners
might
as
well
be
on
the
moon
or
on
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
for
all
that
they
have
to
do
with
selling
this
rental
property.
it’s
petitioners
who
advertise
vacant
apartments,
who
interview
prospective
tenants
and
negotiate
leases,
who
evict
people
for
non
payment
of
rent,
who
handle
every
aspect
of
the
transaction
between
the
building
and
the
tenant.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there’s
sense
in
which
he
is
the
agent
of
the
owner.
there
is
a
sense
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
oh,
yes!
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don’t
think.
i
think
it’s
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
if
we
were
asking
ourselves
the
more
difficult
question
of
whether
we
could
reach
the
building
owner
and
attach
these
sales
to
him
even
though
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
we
could
say,
“yes,
he
has
retained
these
people
as
an
agent.”
but
of
course
they
have
an
independent
business.
they
are
not
purely
an
agent
in
a
sense
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
their
business
is
to
rent
property.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
no
they
have
--
well,
they
have
two.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
sell
services
--
no,
i
think
we
have
to
make
a
basic
distinction
because
there
are
two
kinds
of
sales
involved
here.
it’s
true
that
they
sell
their
services
to
the
building
owners
and
the
property
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
--
but
the
proper
measure
of
their
sale
of
services
to
the
building
owner
is
unquestionably,
their
commissions.
we
don’t
dispute
that.
the
point
is
that
they
also
sell
the
property.
it’s
true
they
do
it
on
behalf
of
the
building
owner,
but
nevertheless,
they
sell
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
true
but
that
makes
no
difference
under
the
statute
and
in
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
--
in
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
our
contention
is
that
it
makes
no
difference
under
the
statute.
in
the
1966,
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
in
the
senate
report
compelling
the
1966
amendments
which
is
set
forth
the
pages
16
and
17
of
our
brief,
the
committee
explained
the
dollar
volume
test
and
they
said
that
it
was
intended
to
measure
the
size
of
an
enterprise
in
terms
of
the
business
transactions
which
result
from
the
activities
of
the
enterprise
as
measured
by
the
purchase
price
paid
by
the
purchaser.
now,
i
find
it
very
hard
to
dispute
the
empirical
conclusion
that
these
leases
of
property
are
business
transactions
that
arise
from
the
activities
of
petitioner’s
enterprise
and
that
is
the
standard.
and
if
you
look
behind
it
in
terms
of
the
congressional
policy
that
underlay
setting
a
dollar
volume
cut
off
point,
congress
was
concerned
with
the
impact
on
commerce,
and
whether
the
building
owner
himself,
if
someone
owned
authority
of
these
buildings,
and
conducted
these
sales
operation
of
rental
space,
or
he
was
acting
as
an
agent
for
different
owners
and
conducted
this
sales
operation
of
rental
space.
in
both
cases,
you
would
have
the
same
impact
on
the
flow
of
goods
and
men
across
state
lines
same
impact
on
commerce.
congress
chose
an
objective
external
standard,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
with
our
--
the
position
of
the
administrator
would
be
and
it
has
been
held
by
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
by
the
dollar
amount
of
the
sales.
yes,
certainly.
now,
let
me
point
out
that
we
do
make
a
distinction
which
i
think
is
relevant
here
between
rental
collection
agents,
and
people
such
as
petitioners
or
businesses
such
as
petitioners.
a
rental
collection
agent,
who
goes
around
and
collects
rents,
is
only
selling
his
services
in
collecting
rents.
and
the
department
of
labor
would
measure
his
enterprise
size
by
the
commission
that
he
earns
and
that
is
because
he
does
not
sell
the
rental
property.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
would
be
the
amount
of
premiums
i
believe
by
which
you
would
measure
even
though
some
of
the
premiums
are
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes
that’s
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
believe
that
is
consistently
the
law.
the
closest
case
that
i
know
to
it
is
slightly
different
is
the
montelvo
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
yes,
that
would
be
the
same
question.
it
would
be
the
same
--
let’s
take
gasoline
service
stations
which
are
common
example.
many
gasoline
stations
do
not
own
the
gasoline
that
they
sell.
it
belongs
to
the
oil
company.
it’s
consigned
to
them.
when
they
sell
it,
they
earn
a
certain
number
of
cents
per
gallon
on
the
sale.
the
rest
of
the
proceeds
belong
to
the
oil
company.
now,
under
petitioner’s
rationale,
you
would
measure
the
sales
of
this
gas
company
by
the
amount
of
commission
it
earned
and
you
would
ignore
what
the
purchase
were
paid
despite
the
fact
that
the
senate
report
says
that
it’s
what
the
purchase
paid.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
these
buildings
are
placed
in
the
exclusive
possession
of
drucker
and
falk.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
oh,
yes.
so
as
the
gasoline
in
the
possession
of
the
person
who
buys
it
once
he
buys
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
was
respect
to
on
rented
premises
and
we
will
start
off
with
the
vacant
premise
or
a
new
building
which
is
turn
over
to
them
and
which
is
empty,
they
have
the
exclusive
possession
of
that
building
for
purposes
of
selling
it
to
tenants,
just
like
the
gas
station
has
the
gasoline.
now,
when
it
is
sold,
that
is
when
the
tenant
signs
a
lease
and
moves
in,
that
they
and
the
building
owners
both
lose
their
possession
of
the
premises
for
the
term
of
the
lease.
with
drucker
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
think
that’s
correct.
and
so
would
let’s
say
a
relatively
small
car
dealership
might
or
grocery
store,
anything
where
there
is
a
small
profit
margin.
a
two-man
business
where
let
us
say
both
individuals
are
making
$30,000
or
$40,000
a
year
is
likely
to
generate
gross
sales
in
excess
of
$500,000.
and
congress
--
that’s
what
congress
provided.
we’re
simply
attempting
to
carry
out
what
we
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
it’s
an
enterprise
engaged
in
commerce,
yes.
i
mean,
there
has
to
be
the
commerce
connection
also.
it
has
to
have
employees
engaged
in
commerce,
which
is
somewhat
different
problem.
now
in
1961,
when
congress
adopted
the
enterprise
concept,
they
referred
to
real
estate
firms
as
one
of
the
businesses
that
would
come
within
the
coverage
of
the
act
and
it’s
little
hard
for
me
to
imagine
that
they
were
thinking
that
commissions
would
be
the
measure
since
they
were
relatively
few
who
would
have
met
the
one
million
dollar
standard
at
that
time,
but
many
real
estate
firms
that
would
have
met
the
$1,000,000.00
as
measured
by
the
volume
of
sales
or
rentals.
the
key
is,
that
this
is
approach
on
an
empirical
basis.
you
look
at
who
makes
the
sale,
who
physically
does
the
selling
operation.
now,
the
district
court
and
petitioners
in
their
brief
have
attempted
to
analogize
this
situation
to
bank
deposits
or
to
loans
that
maybe
closed
by
lawyers.
those
are
completely
different.
the
banks
of
volume
of
business
are
not
in
anyway
measured
by
deposits
that
is
not
considered
a
sale
by
the
bank.
what
the
bank
sells
is
the
use
of
money
when
it
loans
money
and
when
the
bank
makes
a
loan,
we
don’t
measure,
even
there,
the
size
of
its
enterprise
by
the
phase
amount
of
the
loan,
but
rather
what
they’re
selling,
which
is
the
units
of
the
money,
which
is
measured
by
the
interest.
similarly
with
a
law
firm,
they
are
not
selling
the
loan.
all
they
are
selling
are
their
services
in
connection
with
the
loan
and
therefore,
you
measure
it
by
their
fee.
now,
the
fact
that
a
big
and
a
small
business
are
associated
together
in
an
enterprise,
as
here
petitioners
and
their
business
of
managing
and
renting
real
property
and
the
building
owners
and
their
business
of
investing
money
in
real
estate,
it
is
true
that
the
building
owners
standing
along
will
be
exempt
that
there
is
not
uncommon
to
have
an
exempt,
a
non
exempt
person
in
a
joint
enterprise,
in
a
joint
relationship
with
an
employee
and
therefore
the
employee
is
covered.
the
purpose
of
the
act,
is
to
protect
employees
who
are
happen
to
be
employed
in
enterprises
that
are
large
enough
to
come
within
the
coverage.
the
fact
that
they
may
also
be
employed
at
the
same
time
in
a
smaller
enterprise
is
no
basis
for
exemption.
that’s
established
by
the
herbert
harvey
case
for
instance
which
is
a
labor
board
case,
but
involved
the
same
issue.
herbert
harvey
managed,
i
think
it
was
the
world
bank
and
international
organization
are
exempt
from
the
bargaining
requirements
of
the
labor
relations
act.
and
the
theory
of
the
case
was
that,
these
individuals,
janitors,
and
so
on,
were
employees
of
the
management
agent
which
was
exactly
a
management
agent
just
like
petitioners
are
here.
and
the
dc
circuit
held
that
indeed,
these
persons
were
employees
of
the
management
agent,
for
the
purposes
of
the
labor
relations
act.
and
that
the
fact
that
they
were
also
employees
of
an
exempt
organization,
did
not
deprive
them
of
the
benefits
of
the
act
and
the
right
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
because
if
we
are
turning
to
the
employment
argument
now?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
that
could
be
that
you
would
say
it’s
true
that
drucker
and
falk
is
a
covered
enterprise
but
these
are
not
their
employees,
and
i
will
turn
that
issue
now.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
would
be
covered.
yes
and
they
have
treated
them
as
covered
and
there
has
been
no
dispute
about
the
coverage
of
the
central
office
personnel.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
as
far
as
i
know
they’re
paid
above
the
minimum
wage.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
you
have
to
look
at
where
they
were
employed
to
determine
if
they
were
employed
in
an
enterprise
engaged
in
commerce.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
you
have
to
look
at
the
rest
of
their
business
as
we
submit
you
have
to
do
anyway.
if
we
had
lost
the
rents
commission
issue,
and
won
the
employment
issue,
you'd
still
have
to
go
back
to
district
court
to
look
at
the
other
aspects
of
drucker
and
falk
businesses
to
see
whether
they
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
they
would
be
exempted
and
the
central
office
personnel
would
be
exempted
also.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it’s
the
question
of
the
impact
of
an
enterprise
on
commerce,
justice
powell
and
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
of
course,
there
are
differences
still.
even
the
terms
of
the
impact
on
commerce
because
the
petitioners
for
instance
purchase
all
the
supplies.
they
do
all
the
hiring
and
on
a
unit
basis,
that
is
their
enterprise,
carries
for
all
30
of
these
separate
projects.
it
has
all
the
efficiencies
of
scale
that
are
here.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
goes
to
the
underlying
purpose
of
congress
was
distinguished
on
the
basis
of
the
impact
of
an
enterprise
on
commerce,
not
the
impact
of
unrelated
business
activities.
what
they
said
was
if
you
had
related
business
activities
which
taken
together
have
a
sufficient
impact
on
commerce
to
meet
our
dollar
volume
test
then
the
employees
and
all
those
activities
will
be
protected.
if
you
split
it
up,
fragment
it
into
a
series
of
separate
enterprises
then
you
do
not
have
an
enterprise
which
itself
has
a
sufficient
impact
on
commerce
to
meet
the
test.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
suppose
that
if
general
motors
were
divided
into
10
companies,
each
of
which
had
a
share
of
the
market
equivalent
one-tenth
of
general
motors'
share,
you
might
suppose
that
in
some
senses,
the
impact
on
commerce
would
be
the
same.
but
there
are
also
senses
in
which
the
fact
that
it
is
general
motors
all
together
in
one
piece
makes
a
difference
in
terms
of
the
impact
on
commerce.
but
i
don’t
think
congress
was
suggesting
that
the
level
of
national
business
activity
has
to
be
changed,
but
rather
that
it
was
picking
out
for
coverage
employees
who
are
in
enterprises
which
themselves
had
a
sufficient
impact
on
commerce.
now,
on
the
employment
issue,
it’s
conceded
that
these
people
are
employed,
that
the
petitioners
are
employers
of
these
employees.
what
mr.
kelly
did
not
point
to
which
we
also
attach
considerable
weight
to
is
the
definition
of
employ
in
section
3
(g),
which
is
to
suffer
or
permit
to
work.
now,
who
is
it
who
suffers
or
permits
these
employees
to
work?
it’s
perfectly
clear
that
its
petitioners
again,
the
building
owners
are
off
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean.
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
these
people.
the
only
connection
that
they
have
with
these
people
is
approval
of
an
overall
labor
budget.
as
far
as
the
record
discloses
and
from
the
contract
that
appears,
they
don’t
even
have
the
right
to
exercise
a
veto
over
the
hiring
and
firing
and
so
on
as
was
the
case
in
arnheim
&
neely.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
is
some
connection,
again,
if
we
were
here
with
the
difficult
case
of
whether
these
were
employees
of
the
building
owners,
which
we
would
contend,
they
are
but
in
a
secondary
sense,
we
would
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
services
they
perform
benefit
the
building
owners
and
payment
comes
out
of
the
building
owner’s
funds.
but
when
you
say
who
pays
them,
the
arrangement
that
the
building
owners
have
with
the
management
company
happens
to
provide
for
their
payment
by
the
building
owners.
we
do
not
in
any
sense
suggest
though
or
concede
that
has
a
common
law
matter
as
between
the
employees
and
petitioners,
that
petitioners
are
not
responsible
for
their
salaries.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
right.
but
it’s
never
been
viewed
either
in
the
social
legislation
cases
before
this
court
or
in
common
law
cases
that
payment
of
money
alone,
is
the
governing
indicia
of
an
employment
relationship
although
it
maybe
sufficient.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i’m
not
sure
they
would
be
materially
different
case
if
the
employees
were
paid
by
the
management
company
which
in
turn
took
off
cost
plus
kind
of
a
fee
to
do
it.
in
our
view,
that
would
make
no
significant
difference
on
the
case.
now,
well
we’ve
–
i’ve
adverted
to
the
reality
of
the
economic
relationship
between
the
management
company
and
the
employees.
i’d
like
to
point
out
which
is
very
important
that
these
people
are
not
simply
employed
in
the
building
owner’s
enterprise
which
is
real
estate
investment.
they
were
also
employed
in
a
very
real
sense
in
petitioner’s
enterprise
which
is
the
management
of
buildings
for
others.
petitioners
could
not
conduct
their
enterprise,
if
they
did
not
have
these
janitors,
these
elevator
operators,
these
maintenance
personnel.
so,
to
say
that
they
are
not
employed
in
a
meaningful
sense
in
petitioner’s
enterprise,
i
think
it
is
completely
incorrect.
now,
i
think
the
court
was
troubled
or
perhaps
at
least
petitioner’s
counsel
was
troubled
by
the
notion
that
you
might
have
all
these
different
employers
under
the
definition
of
employer
in
the
act.
now,
i
think
that
a
case
could
be
made
out
that
congress
intended
to
permit
multiple
liabilities
not
in
the
sense,
justice
stewart
that
you
could
recover
more
than
once
for
the
statutory
liability
but
in
the
sense
that
there
might
be
several
jointly
liable
individuals.
however,
the
mckay
case,
carved
out
which
is
the
eighth
circuit
case
which
is
discussed
in
both
briefs.
carved
out
what
in
effect
is
the
fellow
servant
exception
that
says
that
“well,
if
the
person
who
you
are
looking
to
does
not
have
his
own
independent
business
enterprise,
but
is
simply
an
employee,
that
is
a
supervisor
or
head
of
the
personnel
office
or
somebody
like
that,
you
cannot
hold
him
independent
liable."
we’re
not
dealing
with
that
case
at
all
here.
we’re
dealing
with
an
independent
business
enterprise
to
which
these
employees
are
vital.
now,
there
was
a
question
asked
to
the
owner’s
liability.
the
owners
in
this
case
would
be
considered
unquestionably
liable,
derivatively
because
they
also
employ
these
individuals
who
are
employed
in
petitioner’s
enterprise.
that
is
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
that
these
individuals
are
covered
under
the
act
by
virtue
their
employment
in
petitioner’s
enterprise
which
is
of
sufficient
size
then
the
building
owners
would
be
liable
not
for
all
of
petitioner’s
employees
but
for
those
who
were
employed
at
the
owner’s
own
building.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
would
be
our
position
although
i
could
see
a
case
here
where
the
building
owner
would
argue
that,
well
the
management
company
maybe
liable,
but
our
connection
is
so
remote
because
we’re
not
involved
in
--
we
don’t
actually
employ
these
people.
we
don’t
suffer
or
permit
them
to
work
except
in
an
indirect
sense.
i’m
not
arguing
that
point
of
view
but
i
think
we
would
have
harder
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it’s
no
doubt
that
has
been
recognized.
no
question.
it
is
recognize
by
this
court
in
the
labor
board
context
in
the
greyhound
case.
and
its
been
recognize
by
numerous
courts
of
appeals
in
cases
that
we
have
cited
and
the
amicus
brief
treat
it
as
though
there
can
only
be
one
employer
and
they
spend
all
of
their
time
establishing
proposition
that
the
building
owner
is
an
employer
of
these
employees
and
our
view
is
that,
that
gets
them
nowhere
because
it
is
not
just
mutually
exclusive
with
petitioners
also
being
an
employer.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
would
be
derivatively
responsible
with
respect
to
those
persons
employed
at
his
building.
if
they
are
employed
in
an
enterprise
engaged
in
commerce,
by
him,
then
the
fact
that
his
enterprise
is
not
big
enough.
if
you
remember
in
the
arnheim
argument,
we
had
the
example
of
the
hair
dressing
salon
and
the
department
store
with
a
hair
dresser
himself
may
not
have
a
big
enough
enterprise
but
if
he
puts
a
unit
in
woodward
&
lothrop
and
they
have
a
big
enough
enterprise
then
those
persons
employed
in
the
woodward
&
lothrop
enterprise
hair
dresser
section
would
be
covered
and
the
hair
dresser
would
be
liable
for
the
payment
of
their
wages
and
woodward
&
lothrop
would
not
unless
–
that
woodward
&
lothrop
would
be
would
depend
on
whether
it
would
be
part
of
woodward
&
lothrop
sales
also.
but
in
other
words,
you
do
not
have
to
yourself
be
an
enterprise
that’s
subject
to
the
act
under
the
dollar
volume
test
in
order
to
have
some
of
your
employees
for
some
other
reason
responsible.
accordingly,
we
submit
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
begin
with
i’d
like
to
point
out
in
line
with
what
mr.
justice
blackmun
noted
earlier
that
both
of
the
issues
that
are
here
before
the
court
today,
have
been
before
four
different
courts
of
appeals.
and
in
each
instance,
there
have
been
unanimous
decisions
in
favor
of
the
government’s
position.
obviously,
in
the
case
below
in
the
fourth
circuit
on
both
issues
and
arnheim
&
neely
in
the
third
circuit
on
both
issues.
with
respect
to
the
rent
commissions
issue
in
the
first
national
bank
case
in
the
tenth
circuit
and
in
jernigan
case
in
the
fifth
circuit,
unanimous
decisions
holding
that
you
don’t
look
simply
at
the
commissions
that
are
earned
but
at
the
rentals
or
on
in
the
case
of
jernigan
the
ticket
sales
of
bus
tickets.
in
the
case
of
the
employment
issue,
you
have
the
second
circuit’s
decision
in
arsenal
building
and
you
have
rather
significant
decision
of
the
dc
circuit
in
the
herbert
harvey
case
which
i
will
get
to
when
i
discuss
the
employment
issue.
i’d
also
like
to
point
out
that
we
are
not
dealing
here
with
a
small
business.
drucker
&
falk
manages
30
apartment
projects
and
they
employ,
that
is,
they
hire,
supervise,
and
discharge
over
a
hundred
persons
in
connection
with
this
venture.
they
procure
annual
rentals
and
excess
of
eight
million
dollars.
we’re
not
talking
about
any
mom
and
pop
operation.
now,
taking
up
the
rent
and
commissions
issue
first,
i
have
no
difficulty
with
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
no
the
court
has
decided
in
arnheim
&
neely
that
the
management
company
conducts
a
single
enterprise
which
consists
of
its
building
management
operations.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
was
decided
in
arnheim
&
neely.
now,
the
question
on
the
rent
commission’s
issue
for
instance
is
how
do
you
determine
the
size?
how
do
you
measure
the
dollar
volume?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
would
rest
on
income
and
of
course,
that
is
very
significant
distinction
because
this
case
does
not
turn
in
any
way
on
the
enterprises
income.
the
congressional
test
was
not
put
on
the
basis
of
income.
for
on
the
basis
of
income,
penn
central
or
lockheed
or
people
like
would
not
have
to
pay
the
minimum
wage.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
income
would
of
course
be
the
commissions.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no
question
about
that,
but
that’s
not
the
statutory
standard
for
coverage.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
would
rest
on
the
sales.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
not
at
all.
if
you
had
--
suppose
you
have
a
consignment
store
which
sell
goods
on
consignment
or
suppose
you
have
a
jeweler
which
usually
does
not
own
the
jewelry
that
they’re
selling
but
has
it
on
what's
called
on
memorandum
from
some
larger
jeweler.
when
he
sells
that,
he
collects
the
full
sales
tax
and
he
is
responsible
for
paying
that
full
sales
tax
to
the
taxing
department.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
collects
the
full
purchase
price
and
then
he
must
remit
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
the
portion
that
belongs
to
the
original
owner
of
the
piece
of
jewelry
or
the
consigned
merchandiser.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
suppose
that’s
true
but
in
any
event
income
is
not
standard.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it’s
gross
sale.
yes,
its
sales
that
made
a
business
stand.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
could
be,
yes.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
that
could
be
also
--
i’ll
re-track
that.
i
don’t
think
it
matters
in
the
context
of
the
statute
with
which
we’re
dealing
here,
which
is
the
context
in
which
we
must
take
the
case.
now,
nobody
disputes
that
the
rental
of
properties
is
a
sale.
i
think
that’s
conceded.
the
question
then
is
who
is
it
who
makes
these
sales.
is
there
some
sense
in
which
we
can
say,
well
this
is
not
drucker
and
falk
sale,
this
is
building
owner’s
sale.
but
we
submit
that
--
first
of
all,
we
submit
that
you
don’t
have
to
divide
it
in
this
way.
you
don’t
have
to
say
either.
it’s
drucker
and
falk’s
sale
or
it
is
the
building
owner’s
sale
because
there
are
many
situations
as
with
the
consignment
sale
situation
where
both
parties
may
have
made
a
sale.
now,
in
this
case,
the
building
owners
might
as
well
be
on
the
moon
or
on
the
bottom
of
the
ocean
for
all
that
they
have
to
do
with
selling
this
rental
property.
it’s
petitioners
who
advertise
vacant
apartments,
who
interview
prospective
tenants
and
negotiate
leases,
who
evict
people
for
non
payment
of
rent,
who
handle
every
aspect
of
the
transaction
between
the
building
and
the
tenant.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
there’s
sense
in
which
he
is
the
agent
of
the
owner.
there
is
a
sense
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
oh,
yes!
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
don’t
think.
i
think
it’s
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
if
we
were
asking
ourselves
the
more
difficult
question
of
whether
we
could
reach
the
building
owner
and
attach
these
sales
to
him
even
though
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
it,
we
could
say,
“yes,
he
has
retained
these
people
as
an
agent.”
but
of
course
they
have
an
independent
business.
they
are
not
purely
an
agent
in
a
sense
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
their
business
is
to
rent
property.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
no,
no
they
have
--
well,
they
have
two.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
they
sell
services
--
no,
i
think
we
have
to
make
a
basic
distinction
because
there
are
two
kinds
of
sales
involved
here.
it’s
true
that
they
sell
their
services
to
the
building
owners
and
the
property
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
--
but
the
proper
measure
of
their
sale
of
services
to
the
building
owner
is
unquestionably,
their
commissions.
we
don’t
dispute
that.
the
point
is
that
they
also
sell
the
property.
it’s
true
they
do
it
on
behalf
of
the
building
owner,
but
nevertheless,
they
sell
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
true
but
that
makes
no
difference
under
the
statute
and
in
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i'm
--
in
the
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
our
contention
is
that
it
makes
no
difference
under
the
statute.
in
the
1966,
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
--
in
the
senate
report
compelling
the
1966
amendments
which
is
set
forth
the
pages
16
and
17
of
our
brief,
the
committee
explained
the
dollar
volume
test
and
they
said
that
it
was
intended
to
measure
the
size
of
an
enterprise
in
terms
of
the
business
transactions
which
result
from
the
activities
of
the
enterprise
as
measured
by
the
purchase
price
paid
by
the
purchaser.
now,
i
find
it
very
hard
to
dispute
the
empirical
conclusion
that
these
leases
of
property
are
business
transactions
that
arise
from
the
activities
of
petitioner’s
enterprise
and
that
is
the
standard.
and
if
you
look
behind
it
in
terms
of
the
congressional
policy
that
underlay
setting
a
dollar
volume
cut
off
point,
congress
was
concerned
with
the
impact
on
commerce,
and
whether
the
building
owner
himself,
if
someone
owned
authority
of
these
buildings,
and
conducted
these
sales
operation
of
rental
space,
or
he
was
acting
as
an
agent
for
different
owners
and
conducted
this
sales
operation
of
rental
space.
in
both
cases,
you
would
have
the
same
impact
on
the
flow
of
goods
and
men
across
state
lines
same
impact
on
commerce.
congress
chose
an
objective
external
standard,
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
with
our
--
the
position
of
the
administrator
would
be
and
it
has
been
held
by
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
by
the
dollar
amount
of
the
sales.
yes,
certainly.
now,
let
me
point
out
that
we
do
make
a
distinction
which
i
think
is
relevant
here
between
rental
collection
agents,
and
people
such
as
petitioners
or
businesses
such
as
petitioners.
a
rental
collection
agent,
who
goes
around
and
collects
rents,
is
only
selling
his
services
in
collecting
rents.
and
the
department
of
labor
would
measure
his
enterprise
size
by
the
commission
that
he
earns
and
that
is
because
he
does
not
sell
the
rental
property.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
would
be
the
amount
of
premiums
i
believe
by
which
you
would
measure
even
though
some
of
the
premiums
are
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes
that’s
right.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i
believe
that
is
consistently
the
law.
the
closest
case
that
i
know
to
it
is
slightly
different
is
the
montelvo
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well
yes,
that
would
be
the
same
question.
it
would
be
the
same
--
let’s
take
gasoline
service
stations
which
are
common
example.
many
gasoline
stations
do
not
own
the
gasoline
that
they
sell.
it
belongs
to
the
oil
company.
it’s
consigned
to
them.
when
they
sell
it,
they
earn
a
certain
number
of
cents
per
gallon
on
the
sale.
the
rest
of
the
proceeds
belong
to
the
oil
company.
now,
under
petitioner’s
rationale,
you
would
measure
the
sales
of
this
gas
company
by
the
amount
of
commission
it
earned
and
you
would
ignore
what
the
purchase
were
paid
despite
the
fact
that
the
senate
report
says
that
it’s
what
the
purchase
paid.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
these
buildings
are
placed
in
the
exclusive
possession
of
drucker
and
falk.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
oh,
yes.
so
as
the
gasoline
in
the
possession
of
the
person
who
buys
it
once
he
buys
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it
was
respect
to
on
rented
premises
and
we
will
start
off
with
the
vacant
premise
or
a
new
building
which
is
turn
over
to
them
and
which
is
empty,
they
have
the
exclusive
possession
of
that
building
for
purposes
of
selling
it
to
tenants,
just
like
the
gas
station
has
the
gasoline.
now,
when
it
is
sold,
that
is
when
the
tenant
signs
a
lease
and
moves
in,
that
they
and
the
building
owners
both
lose
their
possession
of
the
premises
for
the
term
of
the
lease.
with
drucker
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
i
think
that’s
correct.
and
so
would
let’s
say
a
relatively
small
car
dealership
might
or
grocery
store,
anything
where
there
is
a
small
profit
margin.
a
two-man
business
where
let
us
say
both
individuals
are
making
$30,000
or
$40,000
a
year
is
likely
to
generate
gross
sales
in
excess
of
$500,000.
and
congress
--
that’s
what
congress
provided.
we’re
simply
attempting
to
carry
out
what
we
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
if
it’s
an
enterprise
engaged
in
commerce,
yes.
i
mean,
there
has
to
be
the
commerce
connection
also.
it
has
to
have
employees
engaged
in
commerce,
which
is
somewhat
different
problem.
now
in
1961,
when
congress
adopted
the
enterprise
concept,
they
referred
to
real
estate
firms
as
one
of
the
businesses
that
would
come
within
the
coverage
of
the
act
and
it’s
little
hard
for
me
to
imagine
that
they
were
thinking
that
commissions
would
be
the
measure
since
they
were
relatively
few
who
would
have
met
the
one
million
dollar
standard
at
that
time,
but
many
real
estate
firms
that
would
have
met
the
$1,000,000.00
as
measured
by
the
volume
of
sales
or
rentals.
the
key
is,
that
this
is
approach
on
an
empirical
basis.
you
look
at
who
makes
the
sale,
who
physically
does
the
selling
operation.
now,
the
district
court
and
petitioners
in
their
brief
have
attempted
to
analogize
this
situation
to
bank
deposits
or
to
loans
that
maybe
closed
by
lawyers.
those
are
completely
different.
the
banks
of
volume
of
business
are
not
in
anyway
measured
by
deposits
that
is
not
considered
a
sale
by
the
bank.
what
the
bank
sells
is
the
use
of
money
when
it
loans
money
and
when
the
bank
makes
a
loan,
we
don’t
measure,
even
there,
the
size
of
its
enterprise
by
the
phase
amount
of
the
loan,
but
rather
what
they’re
selling,
which
is
the
units
of
the
money,
which
is
measured
by
the
interest.
similarly
with
a
law
firm,
they
are
not
selling
the
loan.
all
they
are
selling
are
their
services
in
connection
with
the
loan
and
therefore,
you
measure
it
by
their
fee.
now,
the
fact
that
a
big
and
a
small
business
are
associated
together
in
an
enterprise,
as
here
petitioners
and
their
business
of
managing
and
renting
real
property
and
the
building
owners
and
their
business
of
investing
money
in
real
estate,
it
is
true
that
the
building
owners
standing
along
will
be
exempt
that
there
is
not
uncommon
to
have
an
exempt,
a
non
exempt
person
in
a
joint
enterprise,
in
a
joint
relationship
with
an
employee
and
therefore
the
employee
is
covered.
the
purpose
of
the
act,
is
to
protect
employees
who
are
happen
to
be
employed
in
enterprises
that
are
large
enough
to
come
within
the
coverage.
the
fact
that
they
may
also
be
employed
at
the
same
time
in
a
smaller
enterprise
is
no
basis
for
exemption.
that’s
established
by
the
herbert
harvey
case
for
instance
which
is
a
labor
board
case,
but
involved
the
same
issue.
herbert
harvey
managed,
i
think
it
was
the
world
bank
and
international
organization
are
exempt
from
the
bargaining
requirements
of
the
labor
relations
act.
and
the
theory
of
the
case
was
that,
these
individuals,
janitors,
and
so
on,
were
employees
of
the
management
agent
which
was
exactly
a
management
agent
just
like
petitioners
are
here.
and
the
dc
circuit
held
that
indeed,
these
persons
were
employees
of
the
management
agent,
for
the
purposes
of
the
labor
relations
act.
and
that
the
fact
that
they
were
also
employees
of
an
exempt
organization,
did
not
deprive
them
of
the
benefits
of
the
act
and
the
right
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
because
if
we
are
turning
to
the
employment
argument
now?
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
yes,
that
could
be
that
you
would
say
it’s
true
that
drucker
and
falk
is
a
covered
enterprise
but
these
are
not
their
employees,
and
i
will
turn
that
issue
now.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
would
be
covered.
yes
and
they
have
treated
them
as
covered
and
there
has
been
no
dispute
about
the
coverage
of
the
central
office
personnel.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
as
far
as
i
know
they’re
paid
above
the
minimum
wage.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
you
have
to
look
at
where
they
were
employed
to
determine
if
they
were
employed
in
an
enterprise
engaged
in
commerce.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
you
have
to
look
at
the
rest
of
their
business
as
we
submit
you
have
to
do
anyway.
if
we
had
lost
the
rents
commission
issue,
and
won
the
employment
issue,
you'd
still
have
to
go
back
to
district
court
to
look
at
the
other
aspects
of
drucker
and
falk
businesses
to
see
whether
they
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
and
they
would
be
exempted
and
the
central
office
personnel
would
be
exempted
also.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
it’s
the
question
of
the
impact
of
an
enterprise
on
commerce,
justice
powell
and
--
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
but
of
course,
there
are
differences
still.
even
the
terms
of
the
impact
on
commerce
because
the
petitioners
for
instance
purchase
all
the
supplies.
they
do
all
the
hiring
and
on
a
unit
basis,
that
is
their
enterprise,
carries
for
all
30
of
these
separate
projects.
it
has
all
the
efficiencies
of
scale
that
are
here.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
that
goes
to
the
underlying
purpose
of
congress
was
distinguished
on
the
basis
of
the
impact
of
an
enterprise
on
commerce,
not
the
impact
of
unrelated
business
activities.
what
they
said
was
if
you
had
related
business
activities
which
taken
together
have
a
sufficient
impact
on
commerce
to
meet
our
dollar
volume
test
then
the
employees
and
all
those
activities
will
be
protected.
if
you
split
it
up,
fragment
it
into
a
series
of
separate
enterprises
then
you
do
not
have
an
enterprise
which
itself
has
a
sufficient
impact
on
commerce
to
meet
the
test.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
well,
i
suppose
that
if
general
motors
were
divided
into
10
companies,
each
of
which
had
a
share
of
the
market
equivalent
one-tenth
of
general
motors'
share,
you
might
suppose
that
in
some
senses,
the
impact
on
commerce
would
be
the
same.
but
there
are
also
senses
in
which
the
fact
that
it
is
general
motors
all
together
in
one
piece
makes
a
difference
in
terms
of
the
impact
on
commerce.
but
i
don’t
think
congress
was
suggesting
that
the
level
of
national
business
activity
has
to
be
changed,
but
rather
that
it
was
picking
out
for
coverage
employees
who
are
in
enterprises
which
themselves
had
a
sufficient
impact
on
commerce.
now,
on
the
employment
issue,
it’s
conceded
that
these
people
are
employed,
that
the
petitioners
are
employers
of
these
employees.
what
mr.
kelly
did
not
point
to
which
we
also
attach
considerable
weight
to
is
the
definition
of
employ
in
section
3
(g),
which
is
to
suffer
or
permit
to
work.
now,
who
is
it
who
suffers
or
permits
these
employees
to
work?
it’s
perfectly
clear
that
its
petitioners
again,
the
building
owners
are
off
at
the
bottom
of
the
ocean.
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
these
people.
the
only
connection
that
they
have
with
these
people
is
approval
of
an
overall
labor
budget.
as
far
as
the
record
discloses
and
from
the
contract
that
appears,
they
don’t
even
have
the
right
to
exercise
a
veto
over
the
hiring
and
firing
and
so
on
as
was
the
case
in
arnheim
&
neely.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
there
is
some
connection,
again,
if
we
were
here
with
the
difficult
case
of
whether
these
were
employees
of
the
building
owners,
which
we
would
contend,
they
are
but
in
a
secondary
sense,
we
would
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
services
they
perform
benefit
the
building
owners
and
payment
comes
out
of
the
building
owner’s
funds.
but
when
you
say
who
pays
them,
the
arrangement
that
the
building
owners
have
with
the
management
company
happens
to
provide
for
their
payment
by
the
building
owners.
we
do
not
in
any
sense
suggest
though
or
concede
that
has
a
common
law
matter
as
between
the
employees
and
petitioners,
that
petitioners
are
not
responsible
for
their
salaries.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that’s
right.
but
it’s
never
been
viewed
either
in
the
social
legislation
cases
before
this
court
or
in
common
law
cases
that
payment
of
money
alone,
is
the
governing
indicia
of
an
employment
relationship
although
it
maybe
sufficient.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
i’m
not
sure
they
would
be
materially
different
case
if
the
employees
were
paid
by
the
management
company
which
in
turn
took
off
cost
plus
kind
of
a
fee
to
do
it.
in
our
view,
that
would
make
no
significant
difference
on
the
case.
now,
well
we’ve
–
i’ve
adverted
to
the
reality
of
the
economic
relationship
between
the
management
company
and
the
employees.
i’d
like
to
point
out
which
is
very
important
that
these
people
are
not
simply
employed
in
the
building
owner’s
enterprise
which
is
real
estate
investment.
they
were
also
employed
in
a
very
real
sense
in
petitioner’s
enterprise
which
is
the
management
of
buildings
for
others.
petitioners
could
not
conduct
their
enterprise,
if
they
did
not
have
these
janitors,
these
elevator
operators,
these
maintenance
personnel.
so,
to
say
that
they
are
not
employed
in
a
meaningful
sense
in
petitioner’s
enterprise,
i
think
it
is
completely
incorrect.
now,
i
think
the
court
was
troubled
or
perhaps
at
least
petitioner’s
counsel
was
troubled
by
the
notion
that
you
might
have
all
these
different
employers
under
the
definition
of
employer
in
the
act.
now,
i
think
that
a
case
could
be
made
out
that
congress
intended
to
permit
multiple
liabilities
not
in
the
sense,
justice
stewart
that
you
could
recover
more
than
once
for
the
statutory
liability
but
in
the
sense
that
there
might
be
several
jointly
liable
individuals.
however,
the
mckay
case,
carved
out
which
is
the
eighth
circuit
case
which
is
discussed
in
both
briefs.
carved
out
what
in
effect
is
the
fellow
servant
exception
that
says
that
“well,
if
the
person
who
you
are
looking
to
does
not
have
his
own
independent
business
enterprise,
but
is
simply
an
employee,
that
is
a
supervisor
or
head
of
the
personnel
office
or
somebody
like
that,
you
cannot
hold
him
independent
liable."
we’re
not
dealing
with
that
case
at
all
here.
we’re
dealing
with
an
independent
business
enterprise
to
which
these
employees
are
vital.
now,
there
was
a
question
asked
to
the
owner’s
liability.
the
owners
in
this
case
would
be
considered
unquestionably
liable,
derivatively
because
they
also
employ
these
individuals
who
are
employed
in
petitioner’s
enterprise.
that
is
if
the
court
were
to
conclude
that
these
individuals
are
covered
under
the
act
by
virtue
their
employment
in
petitioner’s
enterprise
which
is
of
sufficient
size
then
the
building
owners
would
be
liable
not
for
all
of
petitioner’s
employees
but
for
those
who
were
employed
at
the
owner’s
own
building.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
that
would
be
our
position
although
i
could
see
a
case
here
where
the
building
owner
would
argue
that,
well
the
management
company
maybe
liable,
but
our
connection
is
so
remote
because
we’re
not
involved
in
--
we
don’t
actually
employ
these
people.
we
don’t
suffer
or
permit
them
to
work
except
in
an
indirect
sense.
i’m
not
arguing
that
point
of
view
but
i
think
we
would
have
harder
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
it’s
no
doubt
that
has
been
recognized.
no
question.
it
is
recognize
by
this
court
in
the
labor
board
context
in
the
greyhound
case.
and
its
been
recognize
by
numerous
courts
of
appeals
in
cases
that
we
have
cited
and
the
amicus
brief
treat
it
as
though
there
can
only
be
one
employer
and
they
spend
all
of
their
time
establishing
proposition
that
the
building
owner
is
an
employer
of
these
employees
and
our
view
is
that,
that
gets
them
nowhere
because
it
is
not
just
mutually
exclusive
with
petitioners
also
being
an
employer.
mr.
andrew
l.
frey
he
would
be
derivatively
responsible
with
respect
to
those
persons
employed
at
his
building.
if
they
are
employed
in
an
enterprise
engaged
in
commerce,
by
him,
then
the
fact
that
his
enterprise
is
not
big
enough.
if
you
remember
in
the
arnheim
argument,
we
had
the
example
of
the
hair
dressing
salon
and
the
department
store
with
a
hair
dresser
himself
may
not
have
a
big
enough
enterprise
but
if
he
puts
a
