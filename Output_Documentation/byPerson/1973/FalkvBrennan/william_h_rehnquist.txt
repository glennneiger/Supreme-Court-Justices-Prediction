mr.
frey,
i
am
trying
to
understand
your
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question
in
terms
of
if
the
gross
income
were
the
case
in
penn
central
and
lockheed
wouldn’t
have
to
pay
the
minimum
wage.
so,
certainly
they
have
the
gross
income
that
would
bring
them
within
the
status,
do
they
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
gross
sales
and
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they’re
not
selling
their
property.
they’re
selling
somebody
else’s
property.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
the
issue,
yes.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
you
think
that
they
pay
them
has
some
connection?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
fact,
the
money
that
used
to
pay
their
salaries
is
that
of
the
owners
and
not
that
of
petitioners?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
quite
agree.
i
just
questioned
your
statement
that
the
owners
had
virtually
no
connection
with
the
employees
and
you’re
not
mentioning
the
fact
that,
it
was
their
money
that
paid
them
which
may
not
be
overwhelming,
but
it
seems
at
least
a
factor.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
will
each
owner
be
covered
even
though
he
did
not
himself
made
the
dollar
volume
test
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
petitioner
met
the
dollar
volume
test?
