and

of

were
required
to
pay
the
employee,
the
sum
specified
in

would
have

wouldn’t
he?

but
for
those

paychecks,
they
actually

justice

well,
certainly
there’s
nothing.
it’s
a
common
place
i
suppose
know
that
under
this
act
and
under
its
language,
there
can
be
a
more
than
one
employer
of
the
same
person?
justice
potter
stewart
this
is
a
case
which
is
here
by
way
of
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
secretary
of
labor
initiated
this
action
against
the
petitioners
who
are
partners
in
a
real
estate
management
company
for
an
injunction
against
violations
of
various
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
of
1938
as
amended.
the
petitioners’
defense
was
that
they
are
not
employers
of
the
employees
involved
within
the
definition
of
the
act,
that
their
business
is
not
a
single
enterprise
subject
to
the
act’s
requirements,
and
finally
that
even
if
their
business
activities
do
amount
to
an
enterprise
as
declined
in
the
act,
they
do
not
have
an
annual
gross
volume
of
sales
made
or
business
done
of
$500,000
or
more,
and
are
therefore
not
within
the
coverage
of
the
act.
the
district
court
agreed
with
all
three
of
these
contentions
and
dismissed
the
complaint.
the
court
of
appeals
reverse
that
judgment
in
all
respects
and
we
granted
certiorari.
for
the
reason
stated
in
the
written
opinion,
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
petitioners’
business
constituted
a
single
enterprise
and
that
they
were
the
employers
of
the
employees
in
question
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
but
we
hold
that
the
annual
gross
volume
is
to
be
measured
by
the
compensation
they
receive
for
their
management
services,
not
by
the
total
rentals
of
the
buildings
they
manage.
accordingly,
we
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
written
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk.
