very

mr.

that
has
significance
only
when
you
reach
the
conclusion
that
it’s

enterprise,

it?
chief

burger
that

chief
justice
warren
e.

let
us
assume
mr.

that
you
have
a
gross
sales
taxes
of
some
kind
in
a
state
which
was
three
percent
of
the
gross
income
of
an
enterprise.
on
what
would
that
three
percent
tax
rests
in
this
circumstance?
chief
justice
warren
e.

but
it
would
--
and
it
would
be
the
answer
to
the
question
i
suppose
you’d
have
to
say
it
progressed
on
the
commission.
chief

warren
e.

and
not
only
total
rentals.
chief

warren
e.
burger
and
probably
gross
income,
the
gross
sale
tax
would
rest
on
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
owners
in
terms
of
what
they
receive,
i
suppose
if
the
tax
is
brought
and
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
would
a
real
estate
sales
organization
come
within
the
reach
of
this
act,
say
if
it
has
over
$500,000
and
so
forth?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i'll
ask
these
questions
to
you
then.
suppose
that
you
have
a
real
estate
agency
as
many
of
them
do
have,
a
hundred
agents
in
their
operation,
selling
houses.
how
do
you
--
would
it
be
your
view
that
you
would
measure
the
enterprise
by
the
gross
sales
of
houses?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what's
the
difference
when
something
is
placed
in
the
exclusive
possession
of
the
dealer
on
consignments
and
the
management?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
thought
they’re
in
the
possessions
of
the
tenants,
by
the
very
definition
of
tenancy
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
i
don’t
see
how
a
buyer
makes
sense
of
that.
you
were
making
an
analogy
between
the
operator
of
the
refilling
station
and
the
manager
of
this
management
company.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
the
management
company
does
not
have
the
ownership
and
the
exclusive
possession
or
the
exclusive
possession
or
the
occlusive
possession
of
the
building?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
going
back
to
the
real
estate’s
analogy
if
there
is
any
analogy
to
it,
that
would
--
your
theory
would
bring
a
very
small
real
estate
agency
under
the
reach
--
within
the
reach
of
the
act
because
two
good
men,
sometimes
one
man
will
sell
a
million
dollars
worth
of
dwellings
in
one
year
and
certain
of
two
men
if
they
are
good
at
their
trade
will
sell
a
million

worth
in
a
year.
