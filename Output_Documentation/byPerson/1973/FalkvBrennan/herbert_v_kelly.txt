mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
briefly
as
to
the
factual
matters
drucker
&
falk
is
a
real
estate
insurance
and
property
management
firm
that
operates
in
eastern
virginia.
it
manages
one
and
two-storey
apartment
projects,
the
smallest
of
which
is
probably
in
the
30
to
40
unit
area
and
they
run
up
to
units
that
are
covered
under
the
act
and
not
a
part
of
this
suit.
each
project
is
separately
owned,
each
owner
has
an
independent
contract
with
drucker
&
falk
as
to
the
management
of
the
premises
and
as
its
--
as
to
its
services
and
the
contracts
generally
call
for
drucker
&
falk
to
manage
through
resident
--
to
manage
their
property
and
manage
the
maintenance
by
residents
maintenance
superintendents.
they
are
all
maintenance
employees
in
each
project
that
are
on
the
payrolls
of
the
owner
of
the
project
who
stay
at
that
project
in
the
main
with
some
very
unusual
exceptions
and
in
effect,
go
with
the
property.
it’s
the
position
of
drucker
&
falk
in
this
case,
that
the
secretary
of
labor
has
taken
an
illusory
and
strain
definition
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
reach
down
and
include
the
employees
of
the
apartment
projects
as
covered
under
the
act
where
they
could
not
reach
down,
two
of
them
except
through
the
rental
agent
and
that
they
thereby
bootstrapping
themselves
in
the
coverage
where
it
does
not
exist.
factually
as
presented
here,
unless
you
include
the
gross
rental
income
as
income
of
drucker
&
falk,
there
would
be
no
coverage
under
the
act.
in
addition,
unless
you
include
the
employees
who
work
after
projects
then
there
is
no
coverage
of
drucker
&
falk
under
the
act.
it
is
our
position
that
you
have
to
strain
and
come
up
with
illusory
result
in
order
to
include
the
rental
income
and
include
the
employees.
it
is
our
position
with
the
first
matter
of
income
that
income
to
drucker
&
falk
is
the
gross
commission,
therefore,
our
six
commissions
on
the
rentals
and
that
that
is
the
measure
of
their
sales.
it’s
our
position,
therefore,
that
what
they
are
selling
is
services
and
that
what
they
get
paid
for
the
services
is
their
commission.
and
it’s
our
position
that
you
look
at
this
from
two
different
--
three
different
directions.
one,
you
look
at
the
provisions
of
the
statute
with
regards
to
what
is
sales.
you
can
look
at
the
intent
of
congress
with
regards
to
what
is
sale,
or
you
can
reach,
look
at
the
legal
conclusions
that
you
come
to
after
applying
common
law
principles
to
the
facts
involved.
first,
with
regard
to
the
statute
itself,
the
statute
has
a
definition
of
sale,
as
the
court
is
well
aware
which
says
that
the
sale
is
a
sale.
it
is
in
any
sale.
it
says
a
sale
is
any
sale,
exchange,
consignment
for
sale,
shipment
for
sale,
or
other
disposition.
the
statute
goes
on
further
to
say
that
an
enterprise
is
covered
and
that
enterprise
is
any
enterprise
whose,
whose
annual
sales,
and
i
emphasize
the
‘whose’.
volume
of
sales
meets
a
test,
which
in
this
case
is
$500,000.
petitioners
suggest
to
the
court
that
certainly
the
definition
that
i’ve
read
to
you
of
sale
does
not
cover
what
sale
and
this
instance
means.
now,
the
fourth
circuit
found
some
comfort
in
the
last
three
words
which
were
“or
other
disposition”.
it’s
our
position
that
“other
disposition”
can
only
apply
to
a
disposition
of
what
you
are
selling,
and
what
drucker
&
falk
is
selling
is
their
services,
and
the
measure
of
that
is
the
income
to
them,
their
commissions
for
the
services,
which
they
are
selling.
the
gross
volume
of
sales
made
or
business
done
is
what
is
sold
by
the
agent,
his
services.
he
cannot
sell
for
himself
what
is
not
his
and
what
he
sells
for
the
owners
is
the
owner’s
sale.
and
what
the
secretary
of
labor
has
tried
to
do
is
call
the
owner’s
sale
his
sale.
so,
under
that
definition,
there
is
no
definition
which
would
include
the
factual
situation
presented
to
the
court
in
this
case.
if
we
turn
to
the
intent
of
congress,
i
don’t
think
it’s
even
necessary
to
argue
to
the
court
that
it
was
--
that
the
congressional
reports
and
the
statements
of
the
secretary
of
labor
in
amending
the
statute
where
such
that
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
set
the
monetary
limits
with
regard
to
what
they
felt
was
impact
on
commerce,
the
$500,000
in
this
particular
instance,
they
felt
was
sufficient
to
be
an
impact
on
congress
and
therefore
you
had
bigness,
and
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
include
the
big
and
leave
out
the
small.
if,
by
way
of
example,
i
could
say
it
seems
apparent
that
it
was
their
intent
to
include
the
owner
and
his
sales
from
the
owner
of
the
world
trade
center
in
chicago,
but
not
to
include
the
owner
of
the
strip
center
in
stony
creek,
virginia.
and
it
seems
to
me,
you
have
to
strain
and
reach
an
illusory
conclusion
if
you
conclude
that
by
happenstance,
this
strip
operator
in
stony
creek
virginia
is
employing
a
branch
office
of
the
real
estate
agent
in
chicago
who
runs
the
world
trade
center
and
thereby,
he
is
in
commerce.
that’s
a
strained
conclusion
which
is
contrary
to
the
obvious
intent
of
congress.
thirdly,
if
we
turn
strictly
to
common
law
principles,
it
seems
to
the
petitioner
that
the
rentals
do
not
fit
any
definition
that
would
say
that,
that
was
the
gross
sales
of
the
agent.
the
rentals
do
not
belong
to
drucker
&
falk;
they
belong
to
the
apartment
project
owner.
the
drucker
&
falk
does
not
control
the
property,
nor
the
rentals
except
as
agent.
the
rent
which
is
collected
is
not
theirs.
it’s
put
in
a
trust
account
in
and
out,
and
they
spend
it
in
an
even
strong
--
even
more
--
a
fiduciary
position
rather
than
a
dead
end
creditor
position,
because
they
hold
those
sums
in
trust
for
the
owner
whose
income
is
the
rentals
and
not
that
of
drucker
&
falk.
and
the
sums
are
the
distributed,
we
would
suggest,
under
the
direction
and
control
of
the
owner
and
not
of
drucker
&
falk.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
well,
yes
sir,
but
i
don’t
think
there
was
any
basis
for
giving
it
hard
going.
they
--
actually
the
court
of
appeals
decided
in
the
main
based
on
the
wirtz
versus
first
national
bank
in
which
they
say
that
in
that
case,
it
was
concluded
that
rental
income
is
sales.
and
i
have
no
problem
with
that
at
all.
i
agree
with
that.
it’s
a
question
of
whose
sales.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
no.
well,
it’s
honorably
set
by
two
in
the
wirtz
on
the
same
principle,
yes
sir.
that
--
the
case
is
that
a
number
of
cases,
which
i
would
suggest
do
not
apply
in
this
case,
have
ruled
and
if
you
look
at
either
one
of
the
cases,
you
see
that
they
summarily
dispose
of
it
by
saying,
it
has
already
been
decided
in
the
such
and
such
case
that
rental
income
is
sales.
and
i
have
no
argument
that
at
all.
there’s
no
question
about
that.
the
question
is
whose
sales.
and
we
are
saying
that
it’s
the
sales
of
the
owner,
not
the
sales
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
i
think
that
you
have
decided
that
it
did
on
the
arnheim
&
neely
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
yes
sir
and
the
question
is
whether
the
rental
income
is
sale.
it’s
not
a
question
of
income.
you’re
covered
if
your
total
sale
is
in
excess
of
$500,000
and
the
statute
says
whose
sales.
and
you’ve
got
to
conclude
for
that
to
be
liability
that
this
is
a
sale
on
the
part
of
drucker
&
falk
as
versus
the
sale
on
the
part
of
the
owners.
and
where
the
courts
of
appeals
--
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
yes
sir.
his
sale
--
what
he
sells,
the
owner
is
selling
his
premises.
he
signs
the
lease.
what
it
gives
to
the
tenant
is
--
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
yes
sir
and
what
he
sold
was
his
services.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
sir?
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
well,
he
--
he
is
an
advisor
and
assistant
to
the
owner
in
selling
his
property,
yes
sir.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
he
sold
his
services
as
advisor
and
assistant
as
well
he’s
selling.
but
you
certainly
carry
that
is
far
as
mr.
justice
white
is
going
say
in
effect
by
advising,
he’s
helping
him
to
sell.
but
he’s
selling
his
product
which
is
his
services
and
his
sale
is
service.
his
advisory
help
--
may
help
the
owner
to
get
his
sales
in
but
the
courts
of
appeals
went
off
on
these
cases
saying,
we’ve
already
decided
that
this
is
sales
and
did
not
consider
the
question
of
whose
sales
and
the
statute
says,
an
enterprise
who
sales.
and
you
have
got
to
define
those
sales
and
we
suggest
on
the
common
law
principles
that
these
sales
or
selling
what
you
have
to
offer
which
in
the
case
of
drucker
&
falk
is
its
services
as
a
managing
agent.
now,
the
other
position
that
we
have
taken
in
the
case
is
that,
it
was
improper
to
consider
the
employees
who
were
working
at
the
projects
as
maintenance
people
maintaining
the
project
employers
of
drucker
&
falk.
it
is
our
position
that
they
are
employees
of
the
owner.
they
work
for
the
owner.
he
is
their
--
he
pays
their
bill,
their
wages.
he
keeps
their
records.
he
turns
in
the
reports
that
need
to
be
taken
and
that
the
employee
is
the
employee
of
owner,
of
project,
and
not
the
employee
of
drucker
&
falk.
and
we
say
this
knowing
that
there
is
a
definition
in
the
statute
which
says
that
an
employer
includes
any
person
acting
directly
or
indirectly
in
the
interest
of
an
employer
in
relation
to
an
employee.
and
we
do
not
deny
that
drucker
&
falk
fits
that
definition.
they
are
an
employer
under
that
definition.
but
you
must
go
further
than
that
under
the
act.
because
that’s
just
the
definition
what
the
access
is
under
the
6
(a)
and
6
(b),
every
employer
shall
pay
to
each
of
his
employees.
under
7
(a),
shall
employ
any
of
his
employees
and
we
suggest
to
you
that
the
way
--
we
admit
that
he
fits
the
definition
of
employer,
but
we
say
to
you
that
he
is
not
--
the
employee
is
not
his
employee
when
you
are
talking
about
drucker
&
falk.
he
is
his
employee
with
reference
to
the
project
where
he
works.
and
there
is
nothing
so
unusual
about
this
argument.
otherwise,
we
come
to
a
strange
conclusion
in
the
law
that
a
great
multitude
of
people
would
be
liable
under
this
act
for
compliance
with
the
act.
because
under
that
definition,
anyone
who
acts
directly
or
indirectly
in
the
interest
of
the
employer
you
would
include
every
supervisor
that
you
include
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
case.
a
supervisor
under
the
act
is
one
who
has
the
right
to
effectively
hire
or
fire
or
vote
or
otherwise.
and
all
those
sort
of
people
are
acting
fit
to
definition
includes
any
person
who
acts
directly
or
indirectly
in
the
interest
of
an
employer
in
relation
to
an
employee.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
yes
sir
and
certainly
would
and
that
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
if
you
say
just
because
he
fits
the
definition
of
employer,
that
it
is
his
employee
that
you
take
for
instance
in
the
gamet
with
general
motors,
you’ve
got
the
president
of
general
motors
as
his
employer.
the
head
of
stenographic
pool
who
runs
the
pool
and
may
have
the
right
to
hire
and
fire.
the
ladies
in
the
stenographic
pool
would
fit
the
definition
of
employer,
but
i
do
not
think
that
congress
intended
that
she
would
be
considered
as
an
employer
under
the
definition
his
employee
under
the
act.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
yes
sir.
exactly.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
no
sir.
i
am
not
telling
you
anybody
goes
that
far.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
yes
sir,
i
am
saying
to
you
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
concerning
this
matter
in
arnheim
said
that
the
definition
in
this
statute
says
an
employer
is
so
and
so
and
therefore
there
is
coverage
and
that
the
--
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
no
sir.
i
am
saying
to
you
they
would
go
that
far
and
stop
and
find
coverage
here
when
they
should
have
kept
on
going
to
determine
whether
it
was
his
employee
or
not.
i
am
saying
to
you,
if
you
please
that
the
foreman
and
his
employee
in
the
event
of
bankruptcy
will
be
looking
both
to
that
company
that
went
bankrupt
for
their
wages.
they
are
not
employers.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
yes
sir.
the
fourth
circuit
in
deciding
case
mr.
justice
marshall
took
care
of
this,
decided
on
the
basis
that
there
were
some
cases
which
had
found
liability
on
part
of
the
agent
and
cited
one
or
two
and
these
are
the
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
government’s
brief
where
they
say
this
has
already
been
decided.
i
suggest
that
in
each
of
those
cases,
that
question
of
whether
the
agent
is
an
employer,
whether
they
are
his
employees
has
not
been
decided.
in
all
of
those
cases,
the
party’s
defendant
included
the
owner
of
the
premises.
and
secondarily,
included
the
rental
agent,
and
in
each
case,
the
court
disposes
of
the
rental
agency
after
finding
liability
on
the
part
of
the
owner
by
saying,
if
the
owner
is
liable,
the
derivative
agency
liability
applies
and
the
agent
is
liable
just
the
same
as
the
owner.
but
in
our
particular
case,
there
has
been
no
proceedings
against
the
owner
and
therefore,
we
haven’t
found
any
liability.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
assume
it
is
pretty
well
conceded
by
the
government
that
there
is
no
liability
on
the
owner
of
these
projects.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
yes
sir.
because
he
didn’t
need
it.
so,
what
they
have
done
is
use
an
illusory
coverage
to
reach
down
the
end
in
boot
scrap
off
these
people
who
wouldn’t
be
covered
by
saying
that
the
people
worked
for
drucker
&
falk
and
by
saying
that
the
income
of
drucker
&
falk,
the
sales
of
drucker
&
falk
is
the
rent.
and
i
say
to
you,
if
you
please
that
you
just
don’t
have
an
act,
where
an
owner
can
control
whether
he
is
covered
by
the
act
or
not
because
if
that
be
so,
this
man
can
go
in
and
out
of
agents
four
times
a
year.
he
can
be
in
an
out
of
coverage
just
as
often
as
he
wants
to
get
a
new
agent
and
we
suggest
that,
that
was
not
the
intent
of
the
congress,
nor
was
it
the
intent
of
the
statute.
and
i
would
save
the
time
i
have
if
i
may.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
yes
sir,
if
i
may
take
a
moment.
the
court
understands
that
we
don’t
agree
that
the
first
national
bank
case
or
the
jernigan
case
either
one
are
applicable,
though,
counsel
asserts
that
they
are.
the
first
national
bank
case,
the
defendant
bank
owned
the
building
and
rented
it
through
a
management
company
that
was
the
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
that
company.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
recall
the
facts,
the
present
company
drew
$50,000
a
year
from
the
bank
as
salary
and
$1800
a
year
for
the
management
firm.
that
was
strictly
an
ownership
case
where
they
proceeded
against
the
owners
of
the
property.
and
the
jernigan
case
is
again
a
proceedings
against
the
owner.
there,
the
operator
of
the
restaurant
service
station
facilities
with
the
bus
depot
owned
it
and
the
court
concluded
that
he
spent
the
greatest
portion
of
his
time
operating
the
bus
station
and
that’s
where
you
are
with
the
gasoline
cases
that
counsel
refers
to.
there,
you
have
sued
the
owner
who
is
operating
and
in
the
business
of
selling
the
gasoline.
the
problem
that
i
find
with
the
counsel’s
argument
is
that
he
talks
about
sales
of
apartment,
space,
like
you
sell
them
everyday,
like
you
move
in
a
new
tenant
every,
every
monday.
suppose
we
had
an
apartment
project
where
there
is
no
turnover
during
the
entire
year
the
contract
of
management,
what
has
he
sold?
the
rents
come
in
each
month,
has
he
sold
any
space?
same
persons
there
when
he
was
employed
and
there
when
he
left
as
managing
agent?
what
has
he
sold
them,
is
his
services
in
managing
the
project
and
supervising
the
--
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
yes
sir,
the
rents
then
existing
as
what
i
say
to
you.
when
they
come
on
as
managing
agent
as
an
existing
lease,
they
may
want
for
two
years.
they
don't
sell
a
thing
so
far
as
space,
they
sell
their
services.
and
you
could
have
a
project
where
you
would
never
sell
anything,
but
services
if
there
was
no
turn
over.
that's
the
problem
i
have,
and
i
was
sit
down,
is
that
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
take
all
these
theories
of
counsel
as
who
is
covered,
that
the
judges,
example
on
a
district
court
level
where
you
had
the
lawyer
who
was
managing
the
large
estate
that
bought
and
sold
stocks,
bonds,
assets,
real
estate,
in
the
estate,
and
distributed
the
money,
then
had
a
total
gross
income
that
he
covered.
now,
that’s
not
what
the
act
says
and
i
don’t
think
it’s
the
intent
of
congress
that
that
be
true.
i
don’t
think
it’s
the
intent
of
congress.
that
i
think
it
is
illusory,
i
submit
to
you
to
say
that
the
impact
of
a
40-unit
apartment
project
on
warwick
boulevard
in
the
city
of
newport
news
has
one
with
more
impact
on
commerce
sitting
there,
with
drucker
and
falk
managing
it,
than
would
be
managing
it.
the
intact
impact
of
those
40
units
sitting
on
warwick
boulevard
is
whatever
it
is.
and
it
don't
impacted
a
bit
more
if
i
manage
it
or
drucker
and
falk.
it
would
be
just
managed
not
quite
as
well
and
we
submit
that
the
decision
and
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
briefly
as
to
the
factual
matters
drucker
&
falk
is
a
real
estate
insurance
and
property
management
firm
that
operates
in
eastern
virginia.
it
manages
one
and
two-storey
apartment
projects,
the
smallest
of
which
is
probably
in
the
30
to
40
unit
area
and
they
run
up
to
units
that
are
covered
under
the
act
and
not
a
part
of
this
suit.
each
project
is
separately
owned,
each
owner
has
an
independent
contract
with
drucker
&
falk
as
to
the
management
of
the
premises
and
as
its
--
as
to
its
services
and
the
contracts
generally
call
for
drucker
&
falk
to
manage
through
resident
--
to
manage
their
property
and
manage
the
maintenance
by
residents
maintenance
superintendents.
they
are
all
maintenance
employees
in
each
project
that
are
on
the
payrolls
of
the
owner
of
the
project
who
stay
at
that
project
in
the
main
with
some
very
unusual
exceptions
and
in
effect,
go
with
the
property.
it’s
the
position
of
drucker
&
falk
in
this
case,
that
the
secretary
of
labor
has
taken
an
illusory
and
strain
definition
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
to
reach
down
and
include
the
employees
of
the
apartment
projects
as
covered
under
the
act
where
they
could
not
reach
down,
two
of
them
except
through
the
rental
agent
and
that
they
thereby
bootstrapping
themselves
in
the
coverage
where
it
does
not
exist.
factually
as
presented
here,
unless
you
include
the
gross
rental
income
as
income
of
drucker
&
falk,
there
would
be
no
coverage
under
the
act.
in
addition,
unless
you
include
the
employees
who
work
after
projects
then
there
is
no
coverage
of
drucker
&
falk
under
the
act.
it
is
our
position
that
you
have
to
strain
and
come
up
with
illusory
result
in
order
to
include
the
rental
income
and
include
the
employees.
it
is
our
position
with
the
first
matter
of
income
that
income
to
drucker
&
falk
is
the
gross
commission,
therefore,
our
six
commissions
on
the
rentals
and
that
that
is
the
measure
of
their
sales.
it’s
our
position,
therefore,
that
what
they
are
selling
is
services
and
that
what
they
get
paid
for
the
services
is
their
commission.
and
it’s
our
position
that
you
look
at
this
from
two
different
--
three
different
directions.
one,
you
look
at
the
provisions
of
the
statute
with
regards
to
what
is
sales.
you
can
look
at
the
intent
of
congress
with
regards
to
what
is
sale,
or
you
can
reach,
look
at
the
legal
conclusions
that
you
come
to
after
applying
common
law
principles
to
the
facts
involved.
first,
with
regard
to
the
statute
itself,
the
statute
has
a
definition
of
sale,
as
the
court
is
well
aware
which
says
that
the
sale
is
a
sale.
it
is
in
any
sale.
it
says
a
sale
is
any
sale,
exchange,
consignment
for
sale,
shipment
for
sale,
or
other
disposition.
the
statute
goes
on
further
to
say
that
an
enterprise
is
covered
and
that
enterprise
is
any
enterprise
whose,
whose
annual
sales,
and
i
emphasize
the
‘whose’.
volume
of
sales
meets
a
test,
which
in
this
case
is
$500,000.
petitioners
suggest
to
the
court
that
certainly
the
definition
that
i’ve
read
to
you
of
sale
does
not
cover
what
sale
and
this
instance
means.
now,
the
fourth
circuit
found
some
comfort
in
the
last
three
words
which
were
“or
other
disposition”.
it’s
our
position
that
“other
disposition”
can
only
apply
to
a
disposition
of
what
you
are
selling,
and
what
drucker
&
falk
is
selling
is
their
services,
and
the
measure
of
that
is
the
income
to
them,
their
commissions
for
the
services,
which
they
are
selling.
the
gross
volume
of
sales
made
or
business
done
is
what
is
sold
by
the
agent,
his
services.
he
cannot
sell
for
himself
what
is
not
his
and
what
he
sells
for
the
owners
is
the
owner’s
sale.
and
what
the
secretary
of
labor
has
tried
to
do
is
call
the
owner’s
sale
his
sale.
so,
under
that
definition,
there
is
no
definition
which
would
include
the
factual
situation
presented
to
the
court
in
this
case.
if
we
turn
to
the
intent
of
congress,
i
don’t
think
it’s
even
necessary
to
argue
to
the
court
that
it
was
--
that
the
congressional
reports
and
the
statements
of
the
secretary
of
labor
in
amending
the
statute
where
such
that
the
intent
of
congress
was
to
set
the
monetary
limits
with
regard
to
what
they
felt
was
impact
on
commerce,
the
$500,000
in
this
particular
instance,
they
felt
was
sufficient
to
be
an
impact
on
congress
and
therefore
you
had
bigness,
and
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
to
include
the
big
and
leave
out
the
small.
if,
by
way
of
example,
i
could
say
it
seems
apparent
that
it
was
their
intent
to
include
the
owner
and
his
sales
from
the
owner
of
the
world
trade
center
in
chicago,
but
not
to
include
the
owner
of
the
strip
center
in
stony
creek,
virginia.
and
it
seems
to
me,
you
have
to
strain
and
reach
an
illusory
conclusion
if
you
conclude
that
by
happenstance,
this
strip
operator
in
stony
creek
virginia
is
employing
a
branch
office
of
the
real
estate
agent
in
chicago
who
runs
the
world
trade
center
and
thereby,
he
is
in
commerce.
that’s
a
strained
conclusion
which
is
contrary
to
the
obvious
intent
of
congress.
thirdly,
if
we
turn
strictly
to
common
law
principles,
it
seems
to
the
petitioner
that
the
rentals
do
not
fit
any
definition
that
would
say
that,
that
was
the
gross
sales
of
the
agent.
the
rentals
do
not
belong
to
drucker
&
falk;
they
belong
to
the
apartment
project
owner.
the
drucker
&
falk
does
not
control
the
property,
nor
the
rentals
except
as
agent.
the
rent
which
is
collected
is
not
theirs.
it’s
put
in
a
trust
account
in
and
out,
and
they
spend
it
in
an
even
strong
--
even
more
--
a
fiduciary
position
rather
than
a
dead
end
creditor
position,
because
they
hold
those
sums
in
trust
for
the
owner
whose
income
is
the
rentals
and
not
that
of
drucker
&
falk.
and
the
sums
are
the
distributed,
we
would
suggest,
under
the
direction
and
control
of
the
owner
and
not
of
drucker
&
falk.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
well,
yes
sir,
but
i
don’t
think
there
was
any
basis
for
giving
it
hard
going.
they
--
actually
the
court
of
appeals
decided
in
the
main
based
on
the
wirtz
versus
first
national
bank
in
which
they
say
that
in
that
case,
it
was
concluded
that
rental
income
is
sales.
and
i
have
no
problem
with
that
at
all.
i
agree
with
that.
it’s
a
question
of
whose
sales.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
no.
well,
it’s
honorably
set
by
two
in
the
wirtz
on
the
same
principle,
yes
sir.
that
--
the
case
is
that
a
number
of
cases,
which
i
would
suggest
do
not
apply
in
this
case,
have
ruled
and
if
you
look
at
either
one
of
the
cases,
you
see
that
they
summarily
dispose
of
it
by
saying,
it
has
already
been
decided
in
the
such
and
such
case
that
rental
income
is
sales.
and
i
have
no
argument
that
at
all.
there’s
no
question
about
that.
the
question
is
whose
sales.
and
we
are
saying
that
it’s
the
sales
of
the
owner,
not
the
sales
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
i
think
that
you
have
decided
that
it
did
on
the
arnheim
&
neely
i
think
that
the
--
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
yes
sir
and
the
question
is
whether
the
rental
income
is
sale.
it’s
not
a
question
of
income.
you’re
covered
if
your
total
sale
is
in
excess
of
$500,000
and
the
statute
says
whose
sales.
and
you’ve
got
to
conclude
for
that
to
be
liability
that
this
is
a
sale
on
the
part
of
drucker
&
falk
as
versus
the
sale
on
the
part
of
the
owners.
and
where
the
courts
of
appeals
--
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
yes
sir.
his
sale
--
what
he
sells,
the
owner
is
selling
his
premises.
he
signs
the
lease.
what
it
gives
to
the
tenant
is
--
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
yes
sir
and
what
he
sold
was
his
services.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
sir?
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
well,
he
--
he
is
an
advisor
and
assistant
to
the
owner
in
selling
his
property,
yes
sir.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
he
sold
his
services
as
advisor
and
assistant
as
well
he’s
selling.
but
you
certainly
carry
that
is
far
as
mr.
justice
white
is
going
say
in
effect
by
advising,
he’s
helping
him
to
sell.
but
he’s
selling
his
product
which
is
his
services
and
his
sale
is
service.
his
advisory
help
--
may
help
the
owner
to
get
his
sales
in
but
the
courts
of
appeals
went
off
on
these
cases
saying,
we’ve
already
decided
that
this
is
sales
and
did
not
consider
the
question
of
whose
sales
and
the
statute
says,
an
enterprise
who
sales.
and
you
have
got
to
define
those
sales
and
we
suggest
on
the
common
law
principles
that
these
sales
or
selling
what
you
have
to
offer
which
in
the
case
of
drucker
&
falk
is
its
services
as
a
managing
agent.
now,
the
other
position
that
we
have
taken
in
the
case
is
that,
it
was
improper
to
consider
the
employees
who
were
working
at
the
projects
as
maintenance
people
maintaining
the
project
employers
of
drucker
&
falk.
it
is
our
position
that
they
are
employees
of
the
owner.
they
work
for
the
owner.
he
is
their
--
he
pays
their
bill,
their
wages.
he
keeps
their
records.
he
turns
in
the
reports
that
need
to
be
taken
and
that
the
employee
is
the
employee
of
owner,
of
project,
and
not
the
employee
of
drucker
&
falk.
and
we
say
this
knowing
that
there
is
a
definition
in
the
statute
which
says
that
an
employer
includes
any
person
acting
directly
or
indirectly
in
the
interest
of
an
employer
in
relation
to
an
employee.
and
we
do
not
deny
that
drucker
&
falk
fits
that
definition.
they
are
an
employer
under
that
definition.
but
you
must
go
further
than
that
under
the
act.
because
that’s
just
the
definition
what
the
access
is
under
the
6
(a)
and
6
(b),
every
employer
shall
pay
to
each
of
his
employees.
under
7
(a),
shall
employ
any
of
his
employees
and
we
suggest
to
you
that
the
way
--
we
admit
that
he
fits
the
definition
of
employer,
but
we
say
to
you
that
he
is
not
--
the
employee
is
not
his
employee
when
you
are
talking
about
drucker
&
falk.
he
is
his
employee
with
reference
to
the
project
where
he
works.
and
there
is
nothing
so
unusual
about
this
argument.
otherwise,
we
come
to
a
strange
conclusion
in
the
law
that
a
great
multitude
of
people
would
be
liable
under
this
act
for
compliance
with
the
act.
because
under
that
definition,
anyone
who
acts
directly
or
indirectly
in
the
interest
of
the
employer
you
would
include
every
supervisor
that
you
include
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
case.
a
supervisor
under
the
act
is
one
who
has
the
right
to
effectively
hire
or
fire
or
vote
or
otherwise.
and
all
those
sort
of
people
are
acting
fit
to
definition
includes
any
person
who
acts
directly
or
indirectly
in
the
interest
of
an
employer
in
relation
to
an
employee.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
yes
sir
and
certainly
would
and
that
the
point
i
am
making
is
that
if
you
say
just
because
he
fits
the
definition
of
employer,
that
it
is
his
employee
that
you
take
for
instance
in
the
gamet
with
general
motors,
you’ve
got
the
president
of
general
motors
as
his
employer.
the
head
of
stenographic
pool
who
runs
the
pool
and
may
have
the
right
to
hire
and
fire.
the
ladies
in
the
stenographic
pool
would
fit
the
definition
of
employer,
but
i
do
not
think
that
congress
intended
that
she
would
be
considered
as
an
employer
under
the
definition
his
employee
under
the
act.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
yes
sir.
exactly.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
no
sir.
i
am
not
telling
you
anybody
goes
that
far.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
yes
sir,
i
am
saying
to
you
that
the
court
of
appeals
in
concerning
this
matter
in
arnheim
said
that
the
definition
in
this
statute
says
an
employer
is
so
and
so
and
therefore
there
is
coverage
and
that
the
--
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
no
sir.
i
am
saying
to
you
they
would
go
that
far
and
stop
and
find
coverage
here
when
they
should
have
kept
on
going
to
determine
whether
it
was
his
employee
or
not.
i
am
saying
to
you,
if
you
please
that
the
foreman
and
his
employee
in
the
event
of
bankruptcy
will
be
looking
both
to
that
company
that
went
bankrupt
for
their
wages.
they
are
not
employers.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
yes
sir.
the
fourth
circuit
in
deciding
case
mr.
justice
marshall
took
care
of
this,
decided
on
the
basis
that
there
were
some
cases
which
had
found
liability
on
part
of
the
agent
and
cited
one
or
two
and
these
are
the
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
government’s
brief
where
they
say
this
has
already
been
decided.
i
suggest
that
in
each
of
those
cases,
that
question
of
whether
the
agent
is
an
employer,
whether
they
are
his
employees
has
not
been
decided.
in
all
of
those
cases,
the
party’s
defendant
included
the
owner
of
the
premises.
and
secondarily,
included
the
rental
agent,
and
in
each
case,
the
court
disposes
of
the
rental
agency
after
finding
liability
on
the
part
of
the
owner
by
saying,
if
the
owner
is
liable,
the
derivative
agency
liability
applies
and
the
agent
is
liable
just
the
same
as
the
owner.
but
in
our
particular
case,
there
has
been
no
proceedings
against
the
owner
and
therefore,
we
haven’t
found
any
liability.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
assume
it
is
pretty
well
conceded
by
the
government
that
there
is
no
liability
on
the
owner
of
these
projects.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
yes
sir.
because
he
didn’t
need
it.
so,
what
they
have
done
is
use
an
illusory
coverage
to
reach
down
the
end
in
boot
scrap
off
these
people
who
wouldn’t
be
covered
by
saying
that
the
people
worked
for
drucker
&
falk
and
by
saying
that
the
income
of
drucker
&
falk,
the
sales
of
drucker
&
falk
is
the
rent.
and
i
say
to
you,
if
you
please
that
you
just
don’t
have
an
act,
where
an
owner
can
control
whether
he
is
covered
by
the
act
or
not
because
if
that
be
so,
this
man
can
go
in
and
out
of
agents
four
times
a
year.
he
can
be
in
an
out
of
coverage
just
as
often
as
he
wants
to
get
a
new
agent
and
we
suggest
that,
that
was
not
the
intent
of
the
congress,
nor
was
it
the
intent
of
the
statute.
and
i
would
save
the
time
i
have
if
i
may.
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
yes
sir,
if
i
may
take
a
moment.
the
court
understands
that
we
don’t
agree
that
the
first
national
bank
case
or
the
jernigan
case
either
one
are
applicable,
though,
counsel
asserts
that
they
are.
the
first
national
bank
case,
the
defendant
bank
owned
the
building
and
rented
it
through
a
management
company
that
was
the
wholly
owned
subsidiary
of
that
company.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
recall
the
facts,
the
present
company
drew
$50,000
a
year
from
the
bank
as
salary
and
$1800
a
year
for
the
management
firm.
that
was
strictly
an
ownership
case
where
they
proceeded
against
the
owners
of
the
property.
and
the
jernigan
case
is
again
a
proceedings
against
the
owner.
there,
the
operator
of
the
restaurant
service
station
facilities
with
the
bus
depot
owned
it
and
the
court
concluded
that
he
spent
the
greatest
portion
of
his
time
operating
the
bus
station
and
that’s
where
you
are
with
the
gasoline
cases
that
counsel
refers
to.
there,
you
have
sued
the
owner
who
is
operating
and
in
the
business
of
selling
the
gasoline.
the
problem
that
i
find
with
the
counsel’s
argument
is
that
he
talks
about
sales
of
apartment,
space,
like
you
sell
them
everyday,
like
you
move
in
a
new
tenant
every,
every
monday.
suppose
we
had
an
apartment
project
where
there
is
no
turnover
during
the
entire
year
the
contract
of
management,
what
has
he
sold?
the
rents
come
in
each
month,
has
he
sold
any
space?
same
persons
there
when
he
was
employed
and
there
when
he
left
as
managing
agent?
what
has
he
sold
them,
is
his
services
in
managing
the
project
and
supervising
the
--
mr.
herbert
v.
kelly
yes
sir,
the
rents
then
existing
as
what
i
say
to
you.
when
they
come
on
as
managing
agent
as
an
existing
lease,
they
may
want
for
two
years.
they
don't
sell
a
thing
so
far
as
space,
they
sell
their
services.
and
you
could
have
a
project
where
you
would
never
sell
anything,
but
services
if
there
was
no
turn
over.
that's
the
problem
i
have,
and
i
was
sit
down,
is
that
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
take
all
these
theories
of
counsel
as
who
is
covered,
that
the
judges,
example
on
a
district
court
level
where
you
had
the
lawyer
who
was
managing
the
large
estate
that
bought
and
sold
stocks,
bonds,
assets,
real
estate,
in
the
estate,
and
distributed
the
money,
then
had
a
total
gross
income
that
he
covered.
now,
that’s
not
what
the
act
says
and
i
don’t
think
it’s
the
intent
of
congress
that
that
be
true.
i
don’t
think
it’s
the
intent
of
congress.
that
i
think
it
is
illusory,
i
submit
to
you
to
say
that
the
impact
of
a
40-unit
apartment
project
on
warwick
boulevard
in
the
city
of
newport
news
has
one
with
more
impact
on
commerce
sitting
there,
with
drucker
and
falk
managing
it,
than
would
be
managing
it.
the
intact
impact
of
those
40
units
sitting
on
warwick
boulevard
is
whatever
it
is.
and
it
don't
impacted
a
bit
more
if
i
manage
it
or
drucker
and
falk.
it
would
be
just
managed
not
quite
as
well
and
we
submit
that
the
decision
and
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
