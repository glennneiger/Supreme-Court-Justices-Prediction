justice
byron
r.
white
well,
does
the
rental
agent’s
activity
constitute
an
enterprise
within
the
meaning
of
the
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes;
yes,
and
so
the
real
question
is
what
the
income
of
the
enterprise
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
made
the
sale.
he
earned
the
commission
for
making
a
sale.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
rental
agent
made
a
sale
and
he
earned
--
and
he
earned
the
commission.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
sold
the
owner’s
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
sold
the
owner’s
property,
in
a
sense?
justice
byron
r.
white
we're
talking
about
net
income
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
many
--
in
many
businesses,
gross
sales
and
gross
income
are
pretty
close,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
frey,
isn’t
the
rental
agent
the
agent
of
the
owner?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn’t
the
action
on
his
behalf
and
doesn’t
he
have
any
authority
to
sign
a
binding
lease
on
behalf
of
the
owner?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
--
you
usually
talk
about
the
agent’s
acts
as
acts
of
the
principal?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
say
that
the
acts
of
whatever
principal
we
have
to
be
acting
--
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
think
businesses
earn
their
commission
and
that's
why
that's
their
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
their
business
is
management.
it's
management,
selling
services
--
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
the
only
thing
you
said
--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
act
on
his
behalf
in
running
the
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
the
issue,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
why
doesn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
insurance
agent
selling
policy
is
ended
over
a
period
of
time
--
the
premiums
are
going
to
be
certain
amount
of
money
and
that
all
he
does
is
earn
a
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
any
agent
--
insurance
agent
who
sells
insurance
policy
for
the
premiums
are
not
more
than
$500,000
although
his
commission
maybe
$20,000
is
covered.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
that
been
the
law,
is
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn’t
that
the
same
question
as
involve
here,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
technically
i
suppose
if
you
--
even
if
you
say
this
is
an
enterprise,
it
has
an
income
or
has
sales
above
$500,000,
and
you
could
say
that
the
building
employees
aren’t
covered.
i
mean,
that’s
the
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
would
mean
--
which
would
mean
that
their
own
employees
in
their
office
would
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
there
has
not,
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
oh!
well,
they
haven’t
treated
them
as
covered
then.
i
mean,
there's
no
instruction
they
were
covered.
they
wouldn’t
be
covered
if
it
was
not
an
enterprise
(a)
and
(b),
if
it
was
an
enterprise
where
its
income
was
over
$500,000.00.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understand
that
but
what
if
the
--
what
if
the
measure
here
of
sales
was
commissions,
not
rents?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
let's
just
to
assume
that
is
all
they
--
the
only
income
they
had
were
their
sales?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
be
the
rent
that
was
reserved
in
the
lease
for
a
period
of
time?

justice
byron

well,
the
rental
agent
made
a
sale
and
he
earned
--
and
he
earned
the
commission.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
sold
the
owner’s
