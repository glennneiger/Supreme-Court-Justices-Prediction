unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
you
--
unknown
speaker
from
your
statement
and
i
also
recall
from
reading
the
district
court
that
there
was
a
finding
there
was
no
active
case
of
controversy?
unknown
speaker
yes
and
did
the
court
--
what
did
the
court
of
appeal
has
to
do
with
that?
they
just
ignored
it?
unknown
speaker
he
didn’t
say
so?
unknown
speaker
is
that
case
a
controversy
matter
or
sort
of
a
special
issue
that
we
have
to
deal
with?
unknown
speaker
that’s
--
the
district
court
said
that
that
wasn’t
so?
unknown
speaker
so
we
must
assume
i
suppose
that
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
you?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you're
defending
the
court
of
appeals
decision?
unknown
speaker
now
the
court
of
appeals
is
somewhat
brought
it?
unknown
speaker
not
if
the
attack
is
facially
unconstitutional,
you
would
not
go
to
there?
unknown
speaker
and
you
don’t
think
a
federal
declaratory
judgment
act
rather
than
keep
it
(inaudible)
economy?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
you
suggest
equally
the
declaratory
judgment
act
could
not
be
invoked
where
the
attack
is
only
as
applied?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
that
is
a
critical
move,
on
the
issue
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
in
the
first
circuit
case
of
walp
against
hartman,
that
was
an
allegedly
facially
invalid
ordinance,
i
guess
or
a
statute.
unknown
speaker
do
you
make
anything
at
all
out
of
the
facts
that
if
it’s
true
that
there
was
a
criminal
constitutional
pending
against
the
federal
action
or
wasn’t?
unknown
speaker
for
the
same
ordinance,
question?
unknown
speaker
and
that
she
could
raise
the
same
questions
there?
unknown
speaker
yes
or
not?
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cohen,
let
me
interrupt
you.
tell
me
again
what
happen
to
the
decker
case?
unknown
speaker
becker.
unknown
speaker
am
i
misinformed
or
under
a
misapprehension?
i
thought
that
her
case
has
proceeded
that
she
was
prosecuted
and
convicted
and
did
not
appeal?
unknown
speaker
that’s
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
but
the
only
thing
steffel
can
do
is
just
wait
around
at
the
pleasure
of
the
state
authorities
before
attempting
again
to
distribute?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understood
that
--
we
think
they
differ
with
--
unknown
speaker
oh!
i
see!
i
thought
that
--
unknown
speaker
and
they
agreed
with
you
but
too
much?
unknown
speaker
is
the
petitioner
here
in
charge
of
the
becker
case?
unknown
speaker
this
petitioner
isn’t
in
charge
of
the
becker
case?
unknown
speaker
but
to
do
what
is
in
the
situation
that
you
certainly
recurring
where
the
plaintiff
and
the
federal
court
in
an
action
like
this
search
for
facial
and
as
applied
on
the
constitutionality?
unknown
speaker
but
not
as
to
--
unknown
speaker
well,
and
--
unknown
speaker
and
if
it
says
the
law
is
facially
constitutional
then
it
must
dismiss
the
rest
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
in
your
hypothetical
case,
he’s
in
effect
hired
to
hold
to
take
the
vernacular.
he
is
hired
to
hold,
presumably
he
can
do
anything
he
wants
in
that
place?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown

could
i
ask
