justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
available
to
him
under
georgia
law
any
declaratory
judgment
procedure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
did
they
file
in
fulton
county
if
they
are
in
dekalb
county?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
if
you
get
far
enough
away
from
the
irreparable
harm
and
the
kind
of
criteria
you
have
for
an
injunction,
then
you
begin
to
get
into
the
case
and
controversy
problem
that
justice
white
mentioned,
don’t
you?
i
mean
a
completely
abstract
instruction?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
case
of
controversy
standard
is
constitutional
and
the
declaratory
judgment
is
statutory
or
i
mean
if
one
had
to
go,
which
i
take
it
you’re
not
suggesting
and
i’m
certainly
not,
there’s
no
doubt
as
to
which
one
it
would
be?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
both
or
either
of
both
of
those
take
a
three-judge
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
we
--
as
certainly
for
it
to
declare
a
state
statute
unconstitutional
you
have
to
have
some
federal
constitutional
grant;
i
think
it
would
be
due
process?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
wasn’t
a
contention.
not
that
the
people
were
being
harassed
with
a
valid
statute
but
at
least
in
these
circumstances
it
was
unconstitutional
to
apply
the
statute
to
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
didn’t
this
take
a
three-judge
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cohen,
does
your
argument
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
under
--
where
you’re
talking
about
a
statute
as
applied
as
opposed
to
facially
invalid
that
perhaps
there’s
not
even
1983
jurisdiction
that
the
state
official
in
that
case
isn’t
actually
causing
the
person
to
be
deprived
of
any
rights?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don’t
mean
state
action.
let’s
assume
there’s
no
doubt
that
the
claim
here
is
against
the
sheriff
rather
and
that
the
claim
is
that
this
is
sufficient
state
action
but
in
the
rather
tentative
stage
of
this
situation
where
there
wasn’t
actually
any
pending
prosecution,
is
there
any
question
as
to
whether
there
you
can
say
a
state
officer
has
cause
this
man
to
be
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
moore,
let
me
ask
you
one
question
similar
to
what
i
asked
mr.
cohen.
as
i
read
1983,
in
order
for
you
to
state
a
claim,
you
have
to
show
that
the
defendant
is
in
the
language
of
statute
subjects
or
causes
to
be
subjected
your
client
a
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights.
now
in
the
absence
of
a
pending
prosecution,
how
do
you
fit
the
facts
of
your
case
into
that
language?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
assume
there
is
efficient
state
action
but
the
statute
reads
in
the
present
tense
that
they
subject
or
cause
to
be
subjected
your
client.
then
in
the
absence
of
the
present
prosecution,
don’t
you
have
some
job
of
fitting
those
facts
into
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
gist
of
your
complaint
isn’t
then
the
threatened
prosecution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
available
to
him
under
georgia
law
any
declaratory
judgment
procedure?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
did
they

in
