mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
issues
in
this
case
in
our
opinion.
the
first
is
whether
federal
courts
in
the
exercise
of
their
equitable
jurisdiction
should
issue
a
declaration
of
rights
as
to
the
good
faith
enforcement
of
a
facially
valid
state
statute.
there
is
no
allegation
in
this
case
that
there
has
either
been
bad
faith
harassment
or
a
facial
invalidity
to
the
georgia’s
criminal
trespass
law.
the
second
issue
which
i
will
address
myself
to
is
whether,
where
there
is
only
the
application
of
a
state
statute
in
question.
the
statute
first
be
given
the
opportunity
under
the
doctrine
of
abstention
to
apply
that
statute.
in
our
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
properly
declined,
properly
dismissed
the
complaint
here
on
the
basis
of
its
equitable
jurisdiction
and
even
if
they
have
not,
they
would
have
properly
abstained
to
design
the
question,
retain
jurisdiction
until
the
georgia
courts
have
spoken
on
this
issue.
a
federal
declaration
of
right
as
to
a
state
criminal
statute
should
issue
only
where
it
is
necessary
and
appropriate
to
secure
a
vindication
of
constitutional
rights.
this
is
not
such
a
case.
the
federal
courts
here
could
not
provide
any
protection
to
either
the
plaintiff
or
to
any
other
potential
plaintiffs
that
they
could
not
otherwise
receive.
conversely,
there
may
be
many
of
the
significant
disadvantages
described
in
younger
and
samuels
of
federal
intrusion
upon
state
criminal
processes.
it
is
significant
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
not
sought
any
declaration
of
the
georgia
criminal
trespass
law
is
generally
void
or
even
in
values
to
any
class
of
persons.
rarely,
what
it
has
sought
is
a
only
a
declaration
as
to
a
particular
incident,
at
a
particular
shopping
center,
at
a
particular
time,
seeking
to
convey
a
particular
message.
the
only
declaration
that
the
federal
courts
could
issue
in
this
case
is
that
the
conduct
that
occurred
on
october
8
or
the
different
conduct
that
occurred
on
october
10
was
violative
of
federal
constitutional
rights.
it
could
not
have
adjudicated
the
statute
generally.
it
could
not
have
adjudicated
the
statute
as
to
any
other
class
of
persons
or
as
to
anybody
else
seeking
to
come
on
any
other
shopping
center
to
convey
or
to
convey
any
other
message.
in
that
situation,
there
is
no
value.
there
is
no
virtue
in
the
federal
declaration.
the
federal
declaration
doesn't
any
way
achieve
anything.
their
proceeding
through
the
state
courts
could
not
otherwise
receive
it.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
we
don’t
make
that
contention
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
is
a
case
of
controversy
involving
a
federal
constitutional
question
but
it
is
exceptionally
limited
constitutional
question.
where
you’re
talking
about
a
statute
as
applied,
the
only
constitutional
question
is
whether
conduct
in
a
particular
occasion
at
a
particular
time
would
or
would
not
be
violative
of
the
constitution.
it
does
not
in
any
way
say
that
the
georgia
criminal
trespass
law
generally?
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
i
think
there’s
two
principles
they
cut
against
the
principle
of
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
act,
the
right
to
choose
your
forum.
the
first
principle
is
the
principle
of
comity.
not
every
case
or
controversy
that
the
federal
courts
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act
could
decide
--
warrants
decision.
for
example
if
you
have
a
pending
prosecution,
then
younger
and
samuels
limits
the
right
of
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
act.
similarly,
where
we
have
a
non-pending
case
such
as
the
one
we
have
here,
we
don’t
think
that
the
principle
of
comity
should
be
abandoned
altogether.
we
would
say
that
in
that
case,
a
federal
court
can
issue
a
declaration
as
to
officially
invalid
state
statute
in
allegation
of
facial
and
validity.
but
it
cannot
issue
a
declaration
where
your
--
all
that’s
being
sought
as
to
attack
a
statute
as
applied
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
if
there’s
a
due
process
argument,
i
would
presume
that
would
be
true,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
would
take
it
if
the
statute
is
sought
to
be
--
if
the
statute's
statewide
implication
and
it’s
generally
in
value
you
would
need
a
three-judge
court
where
it
is
only
a
single
incident
as
we
had
here,
there
was
no
seeking
of
a
three-judge
court.
i
don’t
think
one
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that’s
correct.
there
was
no
allegation
of
harassment
or
bad
faith
prosecution.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
don’t
think
it
want
a
three-judge
court
because
it’s
only
talking
about
a
particular
potential
incident.
and
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
i
don’t
consider
this
to
be
a
hypothetical
case
if
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
because
of
a
prior
pattern.
i
think
that
--
we're
not
arguing
here
that
there’s
lack
of
concreteness
or
lack
of
rightness
or
lack
of
standing.
our
argument
here
is
that
the
case
was
appropriate
for
decision
but
the
federal
court
in
exercising
its
discretion,
equitable
discretion
here
should
not
have
decided
that
case
because
of
principles
of
comity
or
alternately
should
have
abstain
deciding
it
because
of
principles
of
abstention.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
i
am
defending
judge
tuttle’s
position
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
so
far
as
his
concurring
opinion
goes.
we
would
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
principles
of
younger
and
samuels
are
applicable
in
this
case
only
to
the
extent
that
in
this
case,
the
processes
of
the
state
have
already
been
triggered.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that’s
correct.
but
to
the
extent
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying
that
younger
and
samuels
apply
in
every
instance
where
there
is
an
attack
upon
a
state
statute.
i
would
not
go
that
far.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
correct.
that’s
correct.
i
would
not
--
i
would
feel
that
were
there’s
an
attack
on
facial
invalidity,
you
do
not
have
to
apply
younger
and
samuels
where
there
is
no
pending
prosecution
because
as
i
see,
the
principles
here,
we're
dealing
with
the
question,
two
principles
cutting
against
each
other.
we
have
a
first
--
the
principle
that
a
plaintiff
at
least
since
civil
war
statutes
have
said,
i
can
choose
a
forum.
he
has
a
right
to
go
into
federal
court,
he
has
a
right
to
go
to
state
court
where
he
is
seeking
a
vindication
of
constitutional
right.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
act
provides
another
form,
a
milder
form
of
equitable
relief.
it
provides
that
a
form
of
relief
in
which
there
may
be
different
standards.
for
example,
under
younger
and
samuels,
an
injunction
could
not
issue
whether
it
is
a
pending
or
not
a
pending
situation.
even
in
a
case
of
facial
invalidity.
we
would
say
that
a
declaratory
judgment
however,
being
a
milder
form
of
relief
could
issue
where
there
is
only
an
attack
on
facial
invalidity
in
a
non-pending
situation.
so
that
you
would
achieve
a
right
on
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
act
that
would
not
be
possible
if
you
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
because
i
think
at
that
point
there's
--
you’re
balancing
the
interference
with
the
state
criminal
processes
and
the
value
and
the
need
for
federal
declaration
of
rights.
when
you’re
only
coming
into
as
applied,
there
is
no
necessity.
there’s
no
chilling
effect
if
you
will
on
other
persons
that
need
to
be
vindicated
on
the
federal
court.
you
have
all
the
same
considerations.
on
the
other
hand,
they
warrant
the
doctrine
of
comity
of
being
applied.
you
have
a
potential
duplication
of
proceedings.
the
becker
case
could
still
go
forward
here
because
we
don’t
know
that
the
samuels
case
and
the
becker
case
involve
the
same
considerations.
it
was
facial
invalidity
it
couldn’t
go
forward.
presumably
the
state
would
defer
to
the
federal
declaration
of
rights
in
that
case.
so
you
still
have
a
duplication
of
remedies,
do
you
still
have
interference
with
the
state
process
to
the
extent
that
people
may
want
to
give
way
to
the
decision.
you
have
an
erosion
of
the
role
of
the
jury.
you
have
the
facts
as
in
samuels
that
you
might
have
ancillary
injunctions
or
you
may
have
had
ancillary
types
of
remedies
being
issued
by
the
federal
court.
and
you
have,
in
other
words,
interruption
of
the
state
processes
at
which
there’s
no
corresponding
value
by
obtaining
a
federal
declaration
of
rights.
i
only
have
where
you
have
official
invalid
statute;
i
think
there
is
a
sufficient
warning
of
bringing
in
the
federal
processes
into
play
there
because
there
you
have
a
fact
to
other
people
as
well
and
rights
that
cannot
be
secured
by
piecemeal
adjudication
in
the
state
court.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
we
don’t
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
in
our
opinion,
the
georgia
laws,
section
110
and
1101
of
the
georgia
code
is
broader
than
the
uniformity
declaratory
judgment
act.
and
in
our
opinion,
that
act
confers
a
right
under
georgia
law
to
go
into
the
georgia
courts
as
we've
sought
to
have
done
in
a
pending
action
already
and
obtain
a
declaration
as
to
whether
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
could
or
could
not
have
come
out
of
north
dekalb
shopping
center.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
it
isn’t.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
would
make
the
same
argument.
i
defer
to
the
lake
carriers
for
example
where
mr.
justice
brennan
said
that
the
existence
of
the
state
declaratory
judgment
statute
was
not
material,
as
weekly
there
was
a
new
york
state
declaratory
judgment
act
that
was
not
held
to
be
important.
i
think
the
--
i
think
there
is
no
case,
i
think
this
is
what
the
essential,
but
there
is
no
case
after
younger
and
harris
or
before
younger
and
harris
which
apply
a
federal
declaration
of
rights
to
a
state
statute
as
applied.
abortion
cases
are
mentioned,
that
was
a
case
of
facial
invalidity.
the
case
of
cameron
was
a
case
where
the
court
said
we
don’t
have
any
facial
invalidity.
we
don’t
have
any
bad
faith.
therefore
there
is
no
federal
equitable
jurisdiction
and
it
should
be
a
federal
court
in
its
exercise
of
the
federal
jurisdiction
should
issue
a
declaration
of
rights.
the
court
didn’t
say,
well,
this
would
have
been
a
different
case
if
it
is
a
non-pending
action.
there’s
no
differentiation
prior
to
younger
between
pending
and
non-pending
cases
and
yet
no
case
do
we
have
a
situation
where
the
federal
courts
issued
a
declaration
of
rights
to
the
statute
as
applied.
we're
dealing
after
all
with
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said,
the
most
sensitive
source
of
friction
between
state
and
nation,
namely
the
active
intrusion
of
the
federal
courts
and
the
administration
of
the
criminal
law
for
the
prosecution
of
crimes
solely
within
the
power
of
the
states.
this
is,
especially
applicable
here
we
think,
where
we're
dealing
with
trespass
which
is
--
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice
observed
in
taggart
as
a
matter
of
historic
state
concern.
this
is
the
last
i
think
of
lloyd
also
when
the
state
courts
are
fully
confident
to
adjudicate
federal
questions.
and
there’s
no
indication
that
they’ll
act
in
bad
faith
and
especially
we're
here
as
a
cognizant
of
an
almost
identical
case,
the
becker
case.
in
here,
she
has
one
of
special
state
concern.
we
submit
that
it
would
be
out
of
harmony
with
the
constitutional
presumption
of
state
confidence
where
federal
court
tend
to
intervene.
federal
intervention
after
all
is
peculiar
inconsistent
with
our
federal
framework.
this
is
i
think
especially
appropriate
here
where
we
have
a
situation
where
the
federal
courts
participating
would
not
in
any
anyway
eliminate
uncertainty.
the
next
person
seeking
to
come
on
to
a
shopping
center
in
georgia
would
not
know
even
if
there
was
a
declaration
of
rights
here
as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
the
right
to
come
out
of
that
shopping
center.
someone
come
like
to
come
up
to
the
north
dekalb
shopping
center
for
another
message
not
to
protest
the
vietnam
war
but
perhaps
to
obtain
signatures
on
initiative
petition.
or
to
go
ahead
and
campaign
for
political
office
would
not
know
by
virtue
of
the
declaration
of
rights
here
as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
that
right
to
come
up.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that’s
correct.
that's
correct.
the
--
it
was
a
city
ordinance
requiring
a
license
to
solicit
in
that
case.
and
the
city
or
--
in
their
--
in
that
case
it
was
alleged
that
that
city
ordinance
by
requiring
a
license
in
advance
was
facially
unconstitutional.
that
there
was
no
saving
construction
or
construction
as
applied
that
would
make
any
difference.
i
think
that’s
true
incidentally
mr.
justice
stewart,
of
each
of
the
cases
that
have
cited
by
the
plaintiff.
there's
no
case
they
cite
where
as
here,
you
have
someone
coming
on
to
seek
a
construction
statute
as
applied.
as
a
second
ground
which
we
argued
in
our
brief
here,
in
addition
to
this
distinction
between
cases
where
there
is
a
statute
that
applies
as
opposed
to
a
facially
invalid
statute.
and
that
was
--
even
if
there
a
distinction
to
be
drawn
between
pending
and
non-pending
cases,
that
distinction
should
not
depend
on
whether
there
has
been
an
actual
arrest
or
an
indictment.
in
this
case
we
did
not
have
a
plaintiff
who
merely
go
to
the
shopping
centers
that
i
want
to
come
out
and
the
shopping
center
said
no,
he
went
into
federal
court.
we
have
a
plaintiff
who
twice
came
up
to
north
dekalb
shopping
center.
twice
was
asked
to
leave.
twice
the
police
were
called
and
it
was
only
on
the
second
occasion
when
he
left
at
that
point
that
he
bring
federal
suit.
we
think
in
other
words
that
he
has
actively
invoked
the
processes
of
state
law
enforcement
officially
at
this
point.
and
to
proceed
at
this
point,
moreover
especially
in
view
of
the
better
case
would
involve
a
duplication
of
efforts
and
a
waste
of
resources.
they
were
necessarily
be
state
federal
friction
here
if
the
federal
courts
interfered
by
issuing
a
declaration
of
rights.
and
i
think
this
is
the
offense
to
comity
that
this
court
was
seeking
to
avoid
when
it
issued
younger
and
samuels
decisions.
the
considerations
which
might
warrant
in
other
words
drawing
a
line
between
pending
and
non-pending
cases,
if
that
has
to
be
determinative
should
not
require
them
the
situation
such
as
the
one
we
have
here
that
choices
--
that
this
is
considered
to
be
“a
non-pending
case.”
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
you
have
it
in
the
shopping
center
cases.
i
think
it
is
significant
question
to
state
action.
i
mean,
as
i
read
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
you’re
getting
to
a
real
question
of
the
speculative
nature
of
asking
the
federal
courts
to
step
in
where
there
has
been
no
overt
action
here.
we
don’t
know
what
the
state
officials
would
have
done
in
this
case
if
they
had
actually
operated.
i
think
they
had
raised
these
1983
problems.
i
don’t
think
i’m
prepared
yet
to
--
i
think
you
do
have
the
element
in
a
non-pending
case
always
speculative
in
remoteness.
i
think
that
operates
to
indicate
where
you
have
especially
as
in
applied
situation.
if
you're
going
against
a
state
statute
there’s
no
question
about
it.
but
when
you're
going
into
particular
as
applied
situation
then
you
have
a
real
question
of,
does
1983
apply?
do
we
have
a
real
controversy?
what’s
the
nature
of
the
dispute
and
so
on?
so
that’s
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
federal
court
should
not
act
in
advance
in
that
type
of
situation.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
there
was.
there
was
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
while
the
two
people
came
out
of
the
shopping
center.
mrs.
becker
did
not
leave.
she
was
arrested.
steffel
left.
he
was
not
arrested
out
since
he
left.
steffel
brought
--
and
becker
both
brought
this
action.
the
lower
court
dismissed
as
to
becker
because
there
was
a
pending
prosecution.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
she
could
raise
a
delicate
question
there.
that's
right.
so
we
do
have
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
she
hasn’t
raised
them
because
it
has
been
held
up
pending
this
action.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
there
was
no
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
no
action
was
taken
there.
the
case
was
held
up
pending
resolution
in
this
controversy.
i
don’t
think
--
i
think
it
reach
the
indictment
stage
but
hasn’t
proceeded
to
beyond
that
point.
i
think
what’s
significant
in
this
case
to
show
the
narrowness
of
the
federal
injunction.
i
mean
the
federal
declaration
rights
had
sought
is
to
compare
the
two
handbills
that
were
passed
out
on
this
occasion.
we
have
one
handbill
that
was
passed
out
on
october
8
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
becker.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
becker
case.
becker
was
arrested,
was
brought
up,
was
arraigned
and
then
the
case,
this
action
was
filed
involving
both
becker
and
steffel
at
that
point.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that’s
not
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
becker
started
the
--
i
think
it’s
dealt
with
in
the
footnote
2
at
page
46
of
the
appendix
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
where
the
courts
has
its
oral
argument.
the
court
was
informed
that
becker’s
trial
has
been
indefinitely
continued
presumably
weighing
the
disposition
of
this
appeal.
that’s
the
latest
word
i
know
of
it,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
what
did
happen
in
the
becker
case
was
no
appeal
was
taken
from
the
district
court’s
dismissal
of
the
injunction
of
declaration
of
rights
request
which
is
part
of
this
case.
the
only
appeal
here
was
taken
by
steffel
as
the
declaration
rights.
the
point
i
was
going
to
make
was
to
show,
was
to
compare
exhibit
a
and
exhibit
b,
pages
13
and
14
of
the
appendix
which
is
a
two
handbills
involved
here.
appendix
a
involves
a
message
which
is
unrelated
to
the
shopping
center
and
at
which
there
may
be
alternative
forms
of
communication.
it
is
a
communication
therefore
which
directly
involves
the
same
considerations
as
to
the
type
of
communication
desired
in
tanner
v.
lloyd.
under
tanner
and
lloyd,
we
think
there’s
no
question
that
their
type
of
communication
was
not
permissible
under
private
property
of
the
shopping
center
even
if
the
--
unless
the
shopping
center
which
has
not
been
alleged
here
became
the
functional
equivalent
of
public
property.
exhibit
b
however,
is
a
message
directed
a
particular
tenant
of
the
shopping
center
namely
the
colonial
stores
which
distributed
lettuce.
there
might
be
different
considerations
in
that
case.
that
case
might
be
held
or
might
not
be
held
to
be
more
akin
to
logan
valley
than
to
be
to
akin
to
lloyd.
so
we
have
a
declaration
here
that
that
depends
on
the
happenstance
whether
the
person
has
been
arrested
on
october
8
or
october
10.
if
he
had
been
arrested
on
october
8,
it
would
have
not
governed
the
october
10
conduct.
they've
been
arrested
on
october
10
and
there
was
a
declaration
of
right
as
to
that
conduct,
it
would
not
have
governed
the
october
8
conduct.
in
that
type
of
situation,
to
permit
the
federal
courts
to
interrupt
the
state
processes
--
to
interfere
with
the
state
processes
and
prematurely
adjudicate
the
question
before
the
state
courts
have
been
able
to
adjudicate
it.
we
think
offense
of
principles
of
comity
and
a
federalism
which
are
the
heart
of
younger
and
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
there's
two
things
he
could
have
done.
he
could
have
also
sought
declaration
rights.
we
submit
under
the
georgia
law.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
they
absolutely
differ
in
the
county?
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
we
think
that
there
is
a
right
under
the
georgia
trespass
-
under
the
georgia
declaration
--
declaratory
judgment
act
to
seek
a
declaration
of
rights.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
we
did
mention
them
in
our
brief
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i’m
sorry.
we
have
--
the
cases
are
cited
at
our
brief
at
page
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
there
is
a
dispute.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that’s
right
and
we
are
arguing
the
case
first
in
the
georgia
supreme
court.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
now,
hopefully
that
will
dissolve
the
dispute
at
least
give
some
light
on.
although
that
i
should
mention
that
the
lower
georgia
courts
dismiss
our
action
not
because
they
did
--
we
have
jurisdiction
but
because
they
felt
that
the
controversy
was
not
then
right.
i
mean
it
may
have
been
too
long
in
existence
and
we
haven’t
acted
promptly
enough.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
(voice
overlap)
--
that’s
right.
there's
two
choices
a
person
has.
he
can
either
file
a
declaration
rights
or
he
can
go
or
he
can
proceed
to
take
the
course
of
conduct
and
run
the
risk
of
prosecution.
now,
there
are
clearly
disadvantages
in
proceeding
to
get
a
type
--
to
become
a
lawbreaker
so
to
speak.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
not
in
this
particular
type
of
case.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
it
is
misdemeanor
under
georgia
law
which
i
think
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
it
does
carry
a
potential
jail
sentence
as
well
as
being
a
fine.
but
i
think
that
this
is
the
point
of
dombrowski.
this
is
the
point
of
younger
where
they
say
that
the
penalty
and
the
in
--
attached
to
becoming
a
lawbreaker
is
not
in
of
itself
sufficient
to
invoke
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
do
because
i
think
when
you
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
hope
you
do
too,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
it’s
consistent
because
the
citations
in
your
opinion.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
to
case
like
douglas.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that’s
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
i
think
truly
decision
can
be
read
that
way.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
judge
tuttle
did
agree
with
my
position.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
he
concurred
the
result
and
re-looked
into
it
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
[laughter
attempt]
well,
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
the
line
of
cases
that
you
cite
in
there
mr.
justice
brennan.
cases
like
douglas
versus
city
of
jeannette.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
all
are
facial
invalid.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that’s
correct.
it’s
not
addressed
nor
is
there
any
suggestion
in
any
decisions
that
would
agree
or
disagree
with
me.[laughter]
in
the
time
remaining,
i
just
like
to
address
myself
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that’s
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
they
--
we
took
the
position
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
no
declaration
of
rights
should
issue.
for
this
reason
as
well
as
because
of
younger
and
harris,
they
agreed
with
the
first
and
did
not
get
--
reach
the
second
nor
they
reach.
we
also
argued
abstention
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
did
not
reach
their
question
either
because
that
question
would
only
reached
if
they
have
not
dismissed
the
complaint
if
they
decided
to
retain
jurisdiction.
and
we
certainly
argue
that
here
and
that
even
if
this
court
disagrees
with
the
position
which
i
have
urged
and
besides
if
the
court
should
not
dismiss
the
complaint
at
the
very
least,
they
should
have
retain
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
if
there’s
a
remedy
available
by
the
declaratory
relief.
there
is
also
the
becker
case.
the
becker
case
preceded
the
judgment.
we
might
well
have
a
definitive
state
answer
in
identical
situation
here
with
identical
two
cases
can
get
over
what
the
georgia
trespass
law
means
in
and
as
applied
to
people
in
the
position
of
the
petitioner.
the
abstention
doctrine
as
i
read
the
cases
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
excuse
me?
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no.
but
the
becker
case
would
proceed.
it
may
not
finally
settle
the
controversy
but
may
certainly
give
enlightenment
and
it
may
reach
a
decision
which
either
avoids
a
constitutional
problem
by
saying
that
someone's
similar
situation
can’t
be
prosecuted.
and
therefore
there
is
little
risk
that
steffel
would
be
prosecuted
or
might
reach
out
what
a
modifying
decision
that
constitute
which
would
modify
its
law
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
the
constitutional
question.
it
would
avoid
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
it
is
not
a
pending
action.
there
is
not
a
pending
action
i
think
with
federal
court
can
issue
a
declaration
of
rights
as
to
the
facial
and
validity
of
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
not
as
to
apply
it
because
that
would
vary
from
case
to
case.
there’s
no
virtue.
there’s
no
virtue
as
to
any
other
person
in
having
such
a
declaration
of
rights.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
there’s
no
constitutional
right
to
put
up
a
security.
it
couldn’t
be
secured
otherwise.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
would
submit
that
that’s
the
case,
yes.
i
would
submit
that
in
any
type
of
situation,
the
federal
court
declares
it’s
constitutional.
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
advice
of
all
the
rights
to
which
he
is
entitled
to
be
known
in
advance
before
he
proceeds
under
state
law.
the
case
i
think
in
some
ways,
as
far
as
the
abstention
ground
goes
resembles
the
case
that
was
decided
last
term
by
this
court
called
gibson
v.
berryhill
where
you
have
a
state
statute,
an
optometry
statute,
there
have
been
decisions
by
the
court
in
that
case
that
it
should
exercise
equitable
jurisdictions.
there
was
no
room
for
abstention
but
there
was
also
a
state
case
that
was
preceding
that
involved
other
people
in
a
similar
situation
and
the
court
--
this
court
held
in
that
type
of
situation
that
there
should
be
abstention
until
the
lower
courts
of
the
state
have
passed
upon
the
people.
the
decision
of
the
highest
court
i
think
was
in
georgia
in
a
--
as
to
people
similarly
situated
to
those
who
have
brought
the
action
of
federal
court.
and
it
is
our
position
that
goes
the
same
kind
of
consideration
should
meet
the
abstention
here,
should
this
court
find
federal
--
the
federal
courts
properly
refused
to
exercise
their
equitable
jurisdiction.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
issues
in
this
case
in
our
opinion.
the
first
is
whether
federal
courts
in
the
exercise
of
their
equitable
jurisdiction
should
issue
a
declaration
of
rights
as
to
the
good
faith
enforcement
of
a
facially
valid
state
statute.
there
is
no
allegation
in
this
case
that
there
has
either
been
bad
faith
harassment
or
a
facial
invalidity
to
the
georgia’s
criminal
trespass
law.
the
second
issue
which
i
will
address
myself
to
is
whether,
where
there
is
only
the
application
of
a
state
statute
in
question.
the
statute
first
be
given
the
opportunity
under
the
doctrine
of
abstention
to
apply
that
statute.
in
our
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
properly
declined,
properly
dismissed
the
complaint
here
on
the
basis
of
its
equitable
jurisdiction
and
even
if
they
have
not,
they
would
have
properly
abstained
to
design
the
question,
retain
jurisdiction
until
the
georgia
courts
have
spoken
on
this
issue.
a
federal
declaration
of
right
as
to
a
state
criminal
statute
should
issue
only
where
it
is
necessary
and
appropriate
to
secure
a
vindication
of
constitutional
rights.
this
is
not
such
a
case.
the
federal
courts
here
could
not
provide
any
protection
to
either
the
plaintiff
or
to
any
other
potential
plaintiffs
that
they
could
not
otherwise
receive.
conversely,
there
may
be
many
of
the
significant
disadvantages
described
in
younger
and
samuels
of
federal
intrusion
upon
state
criminal
processes.
it
is
significant
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case
has
not
sought
any
declaration
of
the
georgia
criminal
trespass
law
is
generally
void
or
even
in
values
to
any
class
of
persons.
rarely,
what
it
has
sought
is
a
only
a
declaration
as
to
a
particular
incident,
at
a
particular
shopping
center,
at
a
particular
time,
seeking
to
convey
a
particular
message.
the
only
declaration
that
the
federal
courts
could
issue
in
this
case
is
that
the
conduct
that
occurred
on
october
8
or
the
different
conduct
that
occurred
on
october
10
was
violative
of
federal
constitutional
rights.
it
could
not
have
adjudicated
the
statute
generally.
it
could
not
have
adjudicated
the
statute
as
to
any
other
class
of
persons
or
as
to
anybody
else
seeking
to
come
on
any
other
shopping
center
to
convey
or
to
convey
any
other
message.
in
that
situation,
there
is
no
value.
there
is
no
virtue
in
the
federal
declaration.
the
federal
declaration
doesn't
any
way
achieve
anything.
their
proceeding
through
the
state
courts
could
not
otherwise
receive
it.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
we
don’t
make
that
contention
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
is
a
case
of
controversy
involving
a
federal
constitutional
question
but
it
is
exceptionally
limited
constitutional
question.
where
you’re
talking
about
a
statute
as
applied,
the
only
constitutional
question
is
whether
conduct
in
a
particular
occasion
at
a
particular
time
would
or
would
not
be
violative
of
the
constitution.
it
does
not
in
any
way
say
that
the
georgia
criminal
trespass
law
generally?
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
i
think
there’s
two
principles
they
cut
against
the
principle
of
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
act,
the
right
to
choose
your
forum.
the
first
principle
is
the
principle
of
comity.
not
every
case
or
controversy
that
the
federal
courts
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act
could
decide
--
warrants
decision.
for
example
if
you
have
a
pending
prosecution,
then
younger
and
samuels
limits
the
right
of
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
act.
similarly,
where
we
have
a
non-pending
case
such
as
the
one
we
have
here,
we
don’t
think
that
the
principle
of
comity
should
be
abandoned
altogether.
we
would
say
that
in
that
case,
a
federal
court
can
issue
a
declaration
as
to
officially
invalid
state
statute
in
allegation
of
facial
and
validity.
but
it
cannot
issue
a
declaration
where
your
--
all
that’s
being
sought
as
to
attack
a
statute
as
applied
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
if
there’s
a
due
process
argument,
i
would
presume
that
would
be
true,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
would
take
it
if
the
statute
is
sought
to
be
--
if
the
statute's
statewide
implication
and
it’s
generally
in
value
you
would
need
a
three-judge
court
where
it
is
only
a
single
incident
as
we
had
here,
there
was
no
seeking
of
a
three-judge
court.
i
don’t
think
one
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that’s
correct.
there
was
no
allegation
of
harassment
or
bad
faith
prosecution.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
don’t
think
it
want
a
three-judge
court
because
it’s
only
talking
about
a
particular
potential
incident.
and
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
i
don’t
consider
this
to
be
a
hypothetical
case
if
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
because
of
a
prior
pattern.
i
think
that
--
we're
not
arguing
here
that
there’s
lack
of
concreteness
or
lack
of
rightness
or
lack
of
standing.
our
argument
here
is
that
the
case
was
appropriate
for
decision
but
the
federal
court
in
exercising
its
discretion,
equitable
discretion
here
should
not
have
decided
that
case
because
of
principles
of
comity
or
alternately
should
have
abstain
deciding
it
because
of
principles
of
abstention.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
i
am
defending
judge
tuttle’s
position
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
so
far
as
his
concurring
opinion
goes.
we
would
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
principles
of
younger
and
samuels
are
applicable
in
this
case
only
to
the
extent
that
in
this
case,
the
processes
of
the
state
have
already
been
triggered.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that’s
correct.
but
to
the
extent
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying
that
younger
and
samuels
apply
in
every
instance
where
there
is
an
attack
upon
a
state
statute.
i
would
not
go
that
far.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
correct.
that’s
correct.
i
would
not
--
i
would
feel
that
were
there’s
an
attack
on
facial
invalidity,
you
do
not
have
to
apply
younger
and
samuels
where
there
is
no
pending
prosecution
because
as
i
see,
the
principles
here,
we're
dealing
with
the
question,
two
principles
cutting
against
each
other.
we
have
a
first
--
the
principle
that
a
plaintiff
at
least
since
civil
war
statutes
have
said,
i
can
choose
a
forum.
he
has
a
right
to
go
into
federal
court,
he
has
a
right
to
go
to
state
court
where
he
is
seeking
a
vindication
of
constitutional
right.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
act
provides
another
form,
a
milder
form
of
equitable
relief.
it
provides
that
a
form
of
relief
in
which
there
may
be
different
standards.
for
example,
under
younger
and
samuels,
an
injunction
could
not
issue
whether
it
is
a
pending
or
not
a
pending
situation.
even
in
a
case
of
facial
invalidity.
we
would
say
that
a
declaratory
judgment
however,
being
a
milder
form
of
relief
could
issue
where
there
is
only
an
attack
on
facial
invalidity
in
a
non-pending
situation.
so
that
you
would
achieve
a
right
on
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
act
that
would
not
be
possible
if
you
(voice
overlap).
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
because
i
think
at
that
point
there's
--
you’re
balancing
the
interference
with
the
state
criminal
processes
and
the
value
and
the
need
for
federal
declaration
of
rights.
when
you’re
only
coming
into
as
applied,
there
is
no
necessity.
there’s
no
chilling
effect
if
you
will
on
other
persons
that
need
to
be
vindicated
on
the
federal
court.
you
have
all
the
same
considerations.
on
the
other
hand,
they
warrant
the
doctrine
of
comity
of
being
applied.
you
have
a
potential
duplication
of
proceedings.
the
becker
case
could
still
go
forward
here
because
we
don’t
know
that
the
samuels
case
and
the
becker
case
involve
the
same
considerations.
it
was
facial
invalidity
it
couldn’t
go
forward.
presumably
the
state
would
defer
to
the
federal
declaration
of
rights
in
that
case.
so
you
still
have
a
duplication
of
remedies,
do
you
still
have
interference
with
the
state
process
to
the
extent
that
people
may
want
to
give
way
to
the
decision.
you
have
an
erosion
of
the
role
of
the
jury.
you
have
the
facts
as
in
samuels
that
you
might
have
ancillary
injunctions
or
you
may
have
had
ancillary
types
of
remedies
being
issued
by
the
federal
court.
and
you
have,
in
other
words,
interruption
of
the
state
processes
at
which
there’s
no
corresponding
value
by
obtaining
a
federal
declaration
of
rights.
i
only
have
where
you
have
official
invalid
statute;
i
think
there
is
a
sufficient
warning
of
bringing
in
the
federal
processes
into
play
there
because
there
you
have
a
fact
to
other
people
as
well
and
rights
that
cannot
be
secured
by
piecemeal
adjudication
in
the
state
court.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
we
don’t
agree
with
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
in
our
opinion,
the
georgia
laws,
section
110
and
1101
of
the
georgia
code
is
broader
than
the
uniformity
declaratory
judgment
act.
and
in
our
opinion,
that
act
confers
a
right
under
georgia
law
to
go
into
the
georgia
courts
as
we've
sought
to
have
done
in
a
pending
action
already
and
obtain
a
declaration
as
to
whether
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
could
or
could
not
have
come
out
of
north
dekalb
shopping
center.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no,
it
isn’t.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
would
make
the
same
argument.
i
defer
to
the
lake
carriers
for
example
where
mr.
justice
brennan
said
that
the
existence
of
the
state
declaratory
judgment
statute
was
not
material,
as
weekly
there
was
a
new
york
state
declaratory
judgment
act
that
was
not
held
to
be
important.
i
think
the
--
i
think
there
is
no
case,
i
think
this
is
what
the
essential,
but
there
is
no
case
after
younger
and
harris
or
before
younger
and
harris
which
apply
a
federal
declaration
of
rights
to
a
state
statute
as
applied.
abortion
cases
are
mentioned,
that
was
a
case
of
facial
invalidity.
the
case
of
cameron
was
a
case
where
the
court
said
we
don’t
have
any
facial
invalidity.
we
don’t
have
any
bad
faith.
therefore
there
is
no
federal
equitable
jurisdiction
and
it
should
be
a
federal
court
in
its
exercise
of
the
federal
jurisdiction
should
issue
a
declaration
of
rights.
the
court
didn’t
say,
well,
this
would
have
been
a
different
case
if
it
is
a
non-pending
action.
there’s
no
differentiation
prior
to
younger
between
pending
and
non-pending
cases
and
yet
no
case
do
we
have
a
situation
where
the
federal
courts
issued
a
declaration
of
rights
to
the
statute
as
applied.
we're
dealing
after
all
with
what
mr.
justice
frankfurter
said,
the
most
sensitive
source
of
friction
between
state
and
nation,
namely
the
active
intrusion
of
the
federal
courts
and
the
administration
of
the
criminal
law
for
the
prosecution
of
crimes
solely
within
the
power
of
the
states.
this
is,
especially
applicable
here
we
think,
where
we're
dealing
with
trespass
which
is
--
mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice
observed
in
taggart
as
a
matter
of
historic
state
concern.
this
is
the
last
i
think
of
lloyd
also
when
the
state
courts
are
fully
confident
to
adjudicate
federal
questions.
and
there’s
no
indication
that
they’ll
act
in
bad
faith
and
especially
we're
here
as
a
cognizant
of
an
almost
identical
case,
the
becker
case.
in
here,
she
has
one
of
special
state
concern.
we
submit
that
it
would
be
out
of
harmony
with
the
constitutional
presumption
of
state
confidence
where
federal
court
tend
to
intervene.
federal
intervention
after
all
is
peculiar
inconsistent
with
our
federal
framework.
this
is
i
think
especially
appropriate
here
where
we
have
a
situation
where
the
federal
courts
participating
would
not
in
any
anyway
eliminate
uncertainty.
the
next
person
seeking
to
come
on
to
a
shopping
center
in
georgia
would
not
know
even
if
there
was
a
declaration
of
rights
here
as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
the
right
to
come
out
of
that
shopping
center.
someone
come
like
to
come
up
to
the
north
dekalb
shopping
center
for
another
message
not
to
protest
the
vietnam
war
but
perhaps
to
obtain
signatures
on
initiative
petition.
or
to
go
ahead
and
campaign
for
political
office
would
not
know
by
virtue
of
the
declaration
of
rights
here
as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
that
right
to
come
up.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that’s
correct.
that's
correct.
the
--
it
was
a
city
ordinance
requiring
a
license
to
solicit
in
that
case.
and
the
city
or
--
in
their
--
in
that
case
it
was
alleged
that
that
city
ordinance
by
requiring
a
license
in
advance
was
facially
unconstitutional.
that
there
was
no
saving
construction
or
construction
as
applied
that
would
make
any
difference.
i
think
that’s
true
incidentally
mr.
justice
stewart,
of
each
of
the
cases
that
have
cited
by
the
plaintiff.
there's
no
case
they
cite
where
as
here,
you
have
someone
coming
on
to
seek
a
construction
statute
as
applied.
as
a
second
ground
which
we
argued
in
our
brief
here,
in
addition
to
this
distinction
between
cases
where
there
is
a
statute
that
applies
as
opposed
to
a
facially
invalid
statute.
and
that
was
--
even
if
there
a
distinction
to
be
drawn
between
pending
and
non-pending
cases,
that
distinction
should
not
depend
on
whether
there
has
been
an
actual
arrest
or
an
indictment.
in
this
case
we
did
not
have
a
plaintiff
who
merely
go
to
the
shopping
centers
that
i
want
to
come
out
and
the
shopping
center
said
no,
he
went
into
federal
court.
we
have
a
plaintiff
who
twice
came
up
to
north
dekalb
shopping
center.
twice
was
asked
to
leave.
twice
the
police
were
called
and
it
was
only
on
the
second
occasion
when
he
left
at
that
point
that
he
bring
federal
suit.
we
think
in
other
words
that
he
has
actively
invoked
the
processes
of
state
law
enforcement
officially
at
this
point.
and
to
proceed
at
this
point,
moreover
especially
in
view
of
the
better
case
would
involve
a
duplication
of
efforts
and
a
waste
of
resources.
they
were
necessarily
be
state
federal
friction
here
if
the
federal
courts
interfered
by
issuing
a
declaration
of
rights.
and
i
think
this
is
the
offense
to
comity
that
this
court
was
seeking
to
avoid
when
it
issued
younger
and
samuels
decisions.
the
considerations
which
might
warrant
in
other
words
drawing
a
line
between
pending
and
non-pending
cases,
if
that
has
to
be
determinative
should
not
require
them
the
situation
such
as
the
one
we
have
here
that
choices
--
that
this
is
considered
to
be
“a
non-pending
case.”
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
you
have
it
in
the
shopping
center
cases.
i
think
it
is
significant
question
to
state
action.
i
mean,
as
i
read
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
you’re
getting
to
a
real
question
of
the
speculative
nature
of
asking
the
federal
courts
to
step
in
where
there
has
been
no
overt
action
here.
we
don’t
know
what
the
state
officials
would
have
done
in
this
case
if
they
had
actually
operated.
i
think
they
had
raised
these
1983
problems.
i
don’t
think
i’m
prepared
yet
to
--
i
think
you
do
have
the
element
in
a
non-pending
case
always
speculative
in
remoteness.
i
think
that
operates
to
indicate
where
you
have
especially
as
in
applied
situation.
if
you're
going
against
a
state
statute
there’s
no
question
about
it.
but
when
you're
going
into
particular
as
applied
situation
then
you
have
a
real
question
of,
does
1983
apply?
do
we
have
a
real
controversy?
what’s
the
nature
of
the
dispute
and
so
on?
so
that’s
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
federal
court
should
not
act
in
advance
in
that
type
of
situation.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
there
was.
there
was
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
while
the
two
people
came
out
of
the
shopping
center.
mrs.
becker
did
not
leave.
she
was
arrested.
steffel
left.
he
was
not
arrested
out
since
he
left.
steffel
brought
--
and
becker
both
brought
this
action.
the
lower
court
dismissed
as
to
becker
because
there
was
a
pending
prosecution.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
she
could
raise
a
delicate
question
there.
that's
right.
so
we
do
have
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
she
hasn’t
raised
them
because
it
has
been
held
up
pending
this
action.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
there
was
no
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
no
action
was
taken
there.
the
case
was
held
up
pending
resolution
in
this
controversy.
i
don’t
think
--
i
think
it
reach
the
indictment
stage
but
hasn’t
proceeded
to
beyond
that
point.
i
think
what’s
significant
in
this
case
to
show
the
narrowness
of
the
federal
injunction.
i
mean
the
federal
declaration
rights
had
sought
is
to
compare
the
two
handbills
that
were
passed
out
on
this
occasion.
we
have
one
handbill
that
was
passed
out
on
october
8
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
becker.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
becker
case.
becker
was
arrested,
was
brought
up,
was
arraigned
and
then
the
case,
this
action
was
filed
involving
both
becker
and
steffel
at
that
point.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that’s
not
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
becker
started
the
--
i
think
it’s
dealt
with
in
the
footnote
2
at
page
46
of
the
appendix
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
where
the
courts
has
its
oral
argument.
the
court
was
informed
that
becker’s
trial
has
been
indefinitely
continued
presumably
weighing
the
disposition
of
this
appeal.
that’s
the
latest
word
i
know
of
it,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
what
did
happen
in
the
becker
case
was
no
appeal
was
taken
from
the
district
court’s
dismissal
of
the
injunction
of
declaration
of
rights
request
which
is
part
of
this
case.
the
only
appeal
here
was
taken
by
steffel
as
the
declaration
rights.
the
point
i
was
going
to
make
was
to
show,
was
to
compare
exhibit
a
and
exhibit
b,
pages
13
and
14
of
the
appendix
which
is
a
two
handbills
involved
here.
appendix
a
involves
a
message
which
is
unrelated
to
the
shopping
center
and
at
which
there
may
be
alternative
forms
of
communication.
it
is
a
communication
therefore
which
directly
involves
the
same
considerations
as
to
the
type
of
communication
desired
in
tanner
v.
lloyd.
under
tanner
and
lloyd,
we
think
there’s
no
question
that
their
type
of
communication
was
not
permissible
under
private
property
of
the
shopping
center
even
if
the
--
unless
the
shopping
center
which
has
not
been
alleged
here
became
the
functional
equivalent
of
public
property.
exhibit
b
however,
is
a
message
directed
a
particular
tenant
of
the
shopping
center
namely
the
colonial
stores
which
distributed
lettuce.
there
might
be
different
considerations
in
that
case.
that
case
might
be
held
or
might
not
be
held
to
be
more
akin
to
logan
valley
than
to
be
to
akin
to
lloyd.
so
we
have
a
declaration
here
that
that
depends
on
the
happenstance
whether
the
person
has
been
arrested
on
october
8
or
october
10.
if
he
had
been
arrested
on
october
8,
it
would
have
not
governed
the
october
10
conduct.
they've
been
arrested
on
october
10
and
there
was
a
declaration
of
right
as
to
that
conduct,
it
would
not
have
governed
the
october
8
conduct.
in
that
type
of
situation,
to
permit
the
federal
courts
to
interrupt
the
state
processes
--
to
interfere
with
the
state
processes
and
prematurely
adjudicate
the
question
before
the
state
courts
have
been
able
to
adjudicate
it.
we
think
offense
of
principles
of
comity
and
a
federalism
which
are
the
heart
of
younger
and
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
there's
two
things
he
could
have
done.
he
could
have
also
sought
declaration
rights.
we
submit
under
the
georgia
law.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
yes,
they
absolutely
differ
in
the
county?
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
we
think
that
there
is
a
right
under
the
georgia
trespass
-
under
the
georgia
declaration
--
declaratory
judgment
act
to
seek
a
declaration
of
rights.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
we
did
mention
them
in
our
brief
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i’m
sorry.
we
have
--
the
cases
are
cited
at
our
brief
at
page
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
there
is
a
dispute.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that’s
right
and
we
are
arguing
the
case
first
in
the
georgia
supreme
court.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
now,
hopefully
that
will
dissolve
the
dispute
at
least
give
some
light
on.
although
that
i
should
mention
that
the
lower
georgia
courts
dismiss
our
action
not
because
they
did
--
we
have
jurisdiction
but
because
they
felt
that
the
controversy
was
not
then
right.
i
mean
it
may
have
been
too
long
in
existence
and
we
haven’t
acted
promptly
enough.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
(voice
overlap)
--
that’s
right.
there's
two
choices
a
person
has.
he
can
either
file
a
declaration
rights
or
he
can
go
or
he
can
proceed
to
take
the
course
of
conduct
and
run
the
risk
of
prosecution.
now,
there
are
clearly
disadvantages
in
proceeding
to
get
a
type
--
to
become
a
lawbreaker
so
to
speak.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
not
in
this
particular
type
of
case.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
it
is
misdemeanor
under
georgia
law
which
i
think
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
it
does
carry
a
potential
jail
sentence
as
well
as
being
a
fine.
but
i
think
that
this
is
the
point
of
dombrowski.
this
is
the
point
of
younger
where
they
say
that
the
penalty
and
the
in
--
attached
to
becoming
a
lawbreaker
is
not
in
of
itself
sufficient
to
invoke
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
do
because
i
think
when
you
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
hope
you
do
too,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
it’s
consistent
because
the
citations
in
your
opinion.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
to
case
like
douglas.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that’s
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
i
think
truly
decision
can
be
read
that
way.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
judge
tuttle
did
agree
with
my
position.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
he
concurred
the
result
and
re-looked
into
it
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
[laughter
attempt]
well,
i
think
that
the
--
i
think
the
line
of
cases
that
you
cite
in
there
mr.
justice
brennan.
cases
like
douglas
versus
city
of
jeannette.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
all
are
facial
invalid.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that’s
correct.
it’s
not
addressed
nor
is
there
any
suggestion
in
any
decisions
that
would
agree
or
disagree
with
me.[laughter]
in
the
time
remaining,
i
just
like
to
address
myself
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
that’s
correct.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
they
--
we
took
the
position
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
no
declaration
of
rights
should
issue.
for
this
reason
as
well
as
because
of
younger
and
harris,
they
agreed
with
the
first
and
did
not
get
--
reach
the
second
nor
they
reach.
we
also
argued
abstention
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
did
not
reach
their
question
either
because
that
question
would
only
reached
if
they
have
not
dismissed
the
complaint
if
they
decided
to
retain
jurisdiction.
and
we
certainly
argue
that
here
and
that
even
if
this
court
disagrees
with
the
position
which
i
have
urged
and
besides
if
the
court
should
not
dismiss
the
complaint
at
the
very
least,
they
should
have
retain
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
well,
if
there’s
a
remedy
available
by
the
declaratory
relief.
there
is
also
the
becker
case.
the
becker
case
preceded
the
judgment.
we
might
well
have
a
definitive
state
answer
in
identical
situation
here
with
identical
two
cases
can
get
over
what
the
georgia
trespass
law
means
in
and
as
applied
to
people
in
the
position
of
the
petitioner.
the
abstention
doctrine
as
i
read
the
cases
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
excuse
me?
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
no.
but
the
becker
case
would
proceed.
it
may
not
finally
settle
the
controversy
but
may
certainly
give
enlightenment
and
it
may
reach
a
decision
which
either
avoids
a
constitutional
problem
by
saying
that
someone's
similar
situation
can’t
be
prosecuted.
and
therefore
there
is
little
risk
that
steffel
would
be
prosecuted
or
might
reach
out
what
a
modifying
decision
that
constitute
which
would
modify
its
law
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
the
constitutional
question.
it
would
avoid
--
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
think
it
is
not
a
pending
action.
there
is
not
a
pending
action
i
think
with
federal
court
can
issue
a
declaration
of
rights
as
to
the
facial
and
validity
of
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
not
as
to
apply
it
because
that
would
vary
from
case
to
case.
there’s
no
virtue.
there’s
no
virtue
as
to
any
other
person
in
having
such
a
declaration
of
rights.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
there’s
no
constitutional
right
to
put
up
a
security.
it
couldn’t
be
secured
otherwise.
mr.
lawrence
m.
cohen
i
would
submit
that
that’s
the
case,
yes.
i
would
submit
that
in
any
type
of
situation,
the
federal
court
declares
it’s
constitutional.
the
plaintiff
is
going
to
advice
of
all
the
rights
to
which
he
is
entitled
to
be
known
in
advance
before
he
proceeds
under
state
law.
the
case
i
think
in
some
ways,
as
far
as
the
abstention
ground
goes
resembles
the
case
that
was
decided
last
term
by
this
court
called
gibson
v.
berryhill
where
you
have
a
state
statute,
an
optometry
statute,
there
have
been
decisions
by
the
court
in
that
case
that
it
should
exercise
equitable
jurisdictions.
there
was
no
room
for
abstention
but
there
was
also
a
state
case
that
was
preceding
that
involved
other
people
in
a
similar
situation
and
the
court
--
this
court
held
in
that
type
of
situation
that
there
should
be
abstention
until
the
lower
courts
of
the
state
have
passed
upon
the
people.
the
decision
of
the
highest
court
i
think
was
in
georgia
in
a
--
as
to
people
similarly
situated
to
those
who
have
brought
the
action
of
federal
court.
and
it
is
our
position
that
goes
the
same
kind
of
consideration
should
meet
the
abstention
here,
should
this
court
find
federal
--
the
federal
courts
properly
refused
to
exercise
their
equitable
jurisdiction.
thank
you.
