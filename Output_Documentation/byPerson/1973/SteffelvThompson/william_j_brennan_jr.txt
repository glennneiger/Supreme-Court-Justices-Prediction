you

you
go

know,
so?
justice
william
j.

well,
what
is
the
penalty
then?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

and
what's
that
carrying?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

do
you
think
what
i
said
in

opinion
in
perez

you
draw
up

facially

[laughter]

actually

justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
what
we
had
involved
in
that
case
i
agree
was
facial
unconstitutionality
only?
justice
william

in

the
focus
was
on

i
thought
some
of

draw
that
distinction.

how
clearly
how

well,
actually
i
think
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
you've
said
yourself,
this
court
has
never
addressed
this
distinction
that
you’re
pressing
at.

william
j.
brennan,

did
you
draw
--
do
you
make
the
same
position
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
of
course,
that’s
predicated
on
your
position
that
there
is
a
remedy
by
way
of
declaratory
relief
available
in
the
georgia
system.
