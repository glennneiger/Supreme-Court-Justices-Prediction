mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
howard
moore,
jr.
i
represent
the
petitioner
richard
guy
steffel.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
that
judgment
affirmed
the
denial
of
declaratory
judgment
by
united
states
district
court,
the
northern
district
of
georgia,
in
an
action
in
which
a
declaratory
judgment
is
sought
against
the
threatened,
a
non-pending
state
criminal
prosecution
for
trespass
in
the
georgia
law
section
26
--
section
1503
26
georgia
code
annotated.
the
issue
presented
and
to
be
decided
by
this
court
is
whether
the
standard
set
forth
in
younger
v.
harris
and
samuel
--
samuels
against
mackell
may
be
applied
to
deny
a
petitioner
declaratory
relief
where
there
was
no
pending
state
criminal
prosecution.
the
factual
background
out
of
which
this
controversy
arises
is
as
follows,
there
were
impressively
two
events.
the
first
event
occurred
on
october
8,
1970.
the
petitioner
and
a
young
lady
by
the
name
of
sandra
becker,
both
members
of
an
incorporated
association
known
as
the
atlanta
mobilization
committee
stood
outside
on
the
exterior
sidewalks
of
a
food
store
located
in
the
north
dekalb
shopping
center.
their
purpose
for
their
being
there
was
to
participate
in
handbilling.
they
were
passing
out
handbills
to
invite
the
public
to
attend
an
anti-war
rally
in
downtown
atlanta
on
saturday,
october
31
to
solicit
support
for
the
atlanta
mobilization
committee
and
to
urge
support
for
the
lady's
boycott.
a
copy
of
a
handbill
which
they
were
handling
out
on
that
occasion
is
attached
to
the
appendix
at
page
13.
the
duration
of
the
handbilling
was
about
a
--
about
half
an
hour.
during
the
time
they
were
handbilling,
they
were
quiet
and
they
were
peaceful
and
there
was
no
unreasonable
littering,
if
any
littering
at
all.
the
handbilling
was
then
disrupted
by
the
shopping
center’s
security
guard,
who
ordered
the
petitioner
to
cease.
when
the
petitioner
explained
that
he
was
exercising
his
constitutional
right,
dekalb
county
police
were
called.
police
told
petitioner
and
mrs.
becker,
if
they
did
not
discontinue
that
peaceful
handbilling,
they
would
be
arrested.
the
petitioner
and
mrs.
becker
left
rather
than
being
arrested.
the
second
incident
occurred
on
october
10,
1970,
when
the
petitioner
and
mrs.
becker
distributed
handbills
from
10:30
a.m.
to
2:30
p.m.
about
four
hours
at
the
shopping
center.
they
conducted
themselves
on
that
occasion
in
an
orderly
and
peaceful
manner,
to
deny
the
view
of
the
shopping
center
or
commercial
activities
of
the
center
and
the
disruption
of
the
handbilling
occurred
again,
when
a
security
guard
told
the
petitioner
and
mrs.
becker
to
cease
handbilling
and
leave.
the
manager
of
the
shopping
center
called
the
dekalb
police.
the
police
came
again,
the
petitioner
left,
mrs.
becker
refused
to
leave
and
she
was
arrested.
on
the
16th
of
october,
the
petitioner
began
his
efforts
at
judicial
relief
or
redress,
by
filing
a
complaint
in
the
united
states
district
court
to
the
northern
district
of
georgia
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
on
the
grounds
of
section
1503
of
the
georgia
code
as
applied
to
his
and
mrs.
becker’s
conduct
deprived
them
of
the
first
amendment
rights.
a
hearing,
an
evidentiary
hearing
was
held
on
october
28,
1970
and
the
court
then
later
in
january
of
1971,
state
further
proceedings
in
the
case
to
await
the
decision
of
this
court
in
samuels
against
mackell
and
other
cases
which
the
court
mentioned
in
its
decision.
then
following
the
decision
in
younger
and
samuels,
the
district
judge
applied
younger
and
samuels
to
deny
the
petitioner
of
relief.
although
petitioner
was
won
against
them,
there
was
no
pending
criminal
prosecution.
the
district
judge
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
petitioner
had
failed
to
show
irreparable
injury
as
defined
by
this
court
and
the
defendants’
claim
lack
the
rudiments
of
an
active
controversy.
steffel
then
appealed.
mrs.
becker
and
the
atlanta
mobilization
committee
who
were
petitioners
in
the
district
court
did
not
appeal.
the
district
court
in
a
divided
opinion,
applied
younger
and
samuels
to
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
was
of
the
opinion
and
stated
in
his
opinion
that
that
was
no
different
in
effect
in
a
declaratory
judgment
where
there
was
no
--
where
there
was
not
a
pending
criminal
action.
then
there
was
in
one
point
there
was
a
pending
criminal
action.
and
it
saw
no
difference
in
reasoning
and
therefore
applied
younger
and
samuels
to
this
case.
judge
tuttle
dissented
from
the
extension
of
younger
and
samuels
to
this
case
but
he
concurred
in
the
results
on
a
different
ground.
judge
tuttle
would
have
affirmed
on
the
authority
of
cameron
against
johnson.
a
motion
was
filed
for
rehearing
and
the
rehearing
was
denied,
three
judges
dissented
from
the
denial
of
the
rehearing
and
their
opinion
is
before
the
court.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
the
judge
said
he
like
to
rudiment
of
an
act
controversy.
that
was
the
finding
of
the
district
court.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
it
ignored
it.
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
persuaded
that
there
was
an
act
of
controversy
as
defined
by
this
court
that
the
fact
showed
that
it
is
substantial.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
he
didn’t
say
so
but
it
proceeded
anyway
to
make
a
determination
about
younger
and
samuels.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
it
is
certainly,
it
is
certainly
could
be
but
i
do
not
think
that
it's
dispositive
because
i
think
that
on
this
facts,
there
is
a
substantial
showing
between
parties
of
having
adverse
interest
of
an
immediate
controversy
with
reality.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
they
said
they
like
the
rudiments.
the
district
court
didn’t
say
what
rudiments
were
missing?
it
made
no
findings
that
made
a
conclusion
but
not
defining
the
fact.
it
didn’t
show
what
would
fact
upon
which
it
found
if
the
rudiments
were
missing.
there
is
no
statement
of
facts
there.
i
think
that
was
clearly
erroneous,
clearly
wrong
because
the
petitioner
on
two
occasions
had
been
actually
threatened
with
the
enforcement
of
this
specific
statute
not
with
some
different
statute.
but
he
himself
on
two
occasions
was
threatened
with
the
statute
and
it
is
a
force
of
that
statute
and
his
obedience
to
that
statute
that
has
prevented
him
from
returning
to
the
shopping
center
to
handbill
so
there
is
that
adversity
of
interest
because
he
would
like
very
much
to
go
out
and
handbill.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
i
would
think
--
i
hope
so.[laughter
attempt]
the
court
of
appeal
did
not
say
so,
but
i
think
that
there
is
enough
in
the
record
on
the
facts
where
this
court
can
meet
that
question.
it
is
the
petitioner’s
position
that
the
younger
--
samuels
standards
were
incorrectly
applied
to
this
case.
in
the
context
of
a
threatened
prosecution,
the
application
of
the
younger
and
samuels’s
standards
of
irreparable
injury
are
inappropriate
and
they’re
inappropriate
for
a
number
of
reasons.
the
majority,
i
should
say
that
the
majority
of
the
lower
courts
have
with
the
exception
of
the
fifth
circuit,
refused
to
apply
younger
and
samuels
rule
of
equitable
non-intervention
to
situations
such
as
this.
the
restraining
principles
of
comity
which
in
younger
and
samuels
are
inapplicable
where
the
relief
requested
poses
no
threat
to
an
on-going
state
proceeding
either
criminal
or
non-criminal.
as
a
practical
--
a
comity
is
not
an
absolute
value.
as
a
practical
matter,
some
balancing
must
be
allowed
to
ensure
that
fundamental
federal
rights
are
not
lost
by
blind
compliance
with
comity.
the
purposes
underlying
the
development
of
this
principle
which
include
the
avoidance
of
conflict
with
two
courts,
seeking
to
dispose
of
a
same
case
in
respect
for
the
state
courts
in
the
context
of
a
threatened
criminal
--
threatened
prosecution.
in
samuels,
it
was
held
that
there
is
no
difference
between
declaratory
relief
and
injunctions
with
the
respect
to
the
disrupted
impact
each
on
the
pending
state
prosecution.
the
purpose
for
equating
the
two
forms
of
relief
was
to
require
a
showing
of
irreparable
injury.
in
the
context
of
a
pending
state
court
proceeding,
there
may
be
pragmatic
reasons
for
requiring
such
a
showing.
these
reasons,
i
submit
to
--
would
include
additional
cause
to
judicial
system
of
two
on-going
proceedings
involving
essentially
the
same
subject
matter.
stopping
of
an
on-going
proceeding
where
a
jurisdiction
has
vested
in
the
state
court
and
the
effect
of
judicial
intervention
by
the
federal
court
is
to
rest
away,
to
take
away
from
a
state
court
a
matter
over
which
each
jurisdiction
has
rested
and
you
run
into
a
principle
that
does
not
necessarily
have
to
be
respected
in
all
cases
that
ordinarily
you
don’t
rest
away
jurisdiction
from
a
court
once
it
has
vested.
you
have
then
an
indictment
of
a
state
process
because
implicit
and
federal
intervention
where
there
is
[interruption]
going
on,
is
that
in
some
way
the
state
prosecution
is
inadequate
or
that
the
state
prosecution
is
in
bad
faith
or
that
the
state
judges
are
corrupt,
that
the
state
fact-finding
proceeding
is
inaccurate
--
is
inadequate.
there
are
many
of
variables
enacted
--
referred
to
and
that
familiar
to
this
court
but
it
is
an
indictment.
it
is
a
slander
so
to
speak
of
the
state
processes.
another
reason
is
the
duplication
of
efforts
in
the
disruption
the
status
quo.
these
reasons
are
not
as
compelling
where
a
state
prosecution
has
only
been
threatened.
when
no
state
court
action
is
pending
there
is
no
assurance
the
constitutional
rights
will
receive
time
and
attention.
this
case
is
an
example
of
that.
it
has
been
now
over
three
years
and
steffel
still
has
not
got
any
determination
of
his
rights.
he
still
can’t
return
to
the
shopping
center
for
the
purposes
of
handbilling.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
no,
he
did
not.
georgia
law
by
statute
and
by
court
decision
prohibits
the
intermeddling
of
equity
and
administration
to
criminal
law
and
the
georgia
cases
have
refused
to
accept
jurisdiction
over
matters
involving
the
enforcement
of
criminal
law.
now,
recently
more
than
two
years
after
this
incident,
the
shopping
center
filed
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment
in
the
superior
court
of
fulton
county.
that
action
was
dismissed
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
among
other
reasons.
one
of
the
other
reasons
for
dismissing
it
was
that
there
was
primary
jurisdiction
before,
i
think
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
because
the
union
was
about
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
the
defendant
lives
is
in
fulton
county
and
there
is
a
residence
requirement.
you
have
to
file
in
the
residence
where
the
defendant
is
and
that’s
why
it
was
filed
in
fulton
county.
and
there
is
an
appeal
pending
now
by
the
shopping
center
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
that
appeal
will
be
heard
on
the
15th
which
is
thursday,
friday
i
believe.
where
irreparable
harm
to
criteria
for
declaratory
relief,
rights
and
doubt
may
be
sacrificed
due
to
the
difficulty
in
making
such
a
showing,
the
decision
that
irreparable
harm
should
not
be
a
criterion
for
declaratory
relief
when
no
state
action
is
pending
is
supported
by
legislative
intent
by
case
history
and
by
the
ways
the
chief
architect
of
the
federal
declaratory
judgment,
professor
borchard.
federal
intervention
when
the
state
prosecution
is
threatened
is
less
disruptive
of
the
state’s
activities
and
similar
intervention
when
a
prosecution
is
pending.
a
decree
of
federal
equitable
relief
would
interfere
only
with
the
policing
and
prosecutorial
function
of
the
state’s
executive
branch.
when
the
prosecution
is
pending
however,
federal
intervention
interferes
further
with
the
activities
of
its
judiciary.
the
dual
interests
of
the
federal
court
in
eliminating
threats
for
constitutional
violations
and
in
avoiding
unnecessary
police
interference
might
both
be
protected
by
directing
appropriate
orders
to
responsible
officials
they
could
correct
the
situation
internally
themselves.
if
there's
a
declaratory
relief
in
a
non-pending
situation
is
that
its
non-coercive
effect
allows
law
enforcement
officials
to
continue
to
function.
now,
declaratory
judgment
and
injunctive
relief
should
be
distinguished.
a
declaratory
judgment
can
be
distinguished
from
the
equitable
relief
of
an
injunction
in
several
respects
and
i
should
indicate
that
declaratory
judgment
is
not
a
legal
remedy,
not
an
equitable
remedy
rather
but
it's
a
legal
remedy.
some
of
the
distinguishing
factors
are
is
that,
one,
a
lack
of
an
adequate
legal
remedy
is
a
pre-requisite
for
injunctive
relief
but
is
not
a
criterion
for
declaratory
relief,
rule
57
on
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
points
this
out.
this
has
been
a
tradition
--
a
traditional
and
ancient,
a
requirement
for
the
intervention
of
equity
that
that
be
an
absence
of
an
adequate
remedy
at
law
or
other
appropriate
remedy
at
law.
that
was
traditionally
the
way
that
the
interest
of
equity
was
balanced
against
the
interest
of
the
lower
court
and
gave
rise
more
or
less
to
the
equity
course
by
preventing
embarrassment
--
showing
the
ineffectiveness
of
equity
by
introducing
or
by
decreeing
an
order
that
could
not
be
enforced.
by
granting
declaratory
relief,
the
petitioner
need
not
show
the
inappropriateness
of
other
forms
of
relief.
the
petitioner
need
only
show
that
the
declaratory
judgment
can
handle
the
dispute
efficiently
and
economically.
injunctive
relief
immunizes
particular
conduct
by
enjoining
further
prosecution
whereas
a
declaration
merely
interprets
the
law
and
has
no
injunctive
effect.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
well,
it’s
not
completely
abstract
because
this
court
as
well
as
the
statute,
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
has
defined
standards
to
determine
when
a
controversy
exists
over
which
the
district
court
can
assume
jurisdiction.
so
it’s
not
all
together
abstract
that
requires
an
exercise
of
judgment,
discretion
by
the
district
judge,
whomever
is
determining
the
matter
but
it’s
not
entirely
abstract.
and
in
the
logic
of
consequences
of
the
position
of
case
and
controversy
would
be
perhaps
to
repeal
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
if
the
case
in
controversy
is
standard
isn’t
given
a
real
life
content
would
mean
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
i
understand
that.
but
--
i’m
simply
saying
that
the
case
in
controversy
standard
has
to
be
applied
against
the
background
of
declaratory
judgment
act
and
to
be
too
restrictive
in
the
case
of
controversy
would
result,
could
result
in
repealing
the
declaratory
judgment
action.
and
whether
that
would
be
statutory
or
not,
is
not
a
question.
i
think
that’s
really
involved
in
this
question
of
the
case.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
that
is
a
good
question
for
us.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
resume,
i
would
like
to
resume
with
the
question
put
to
me
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
with
respect
to
the
application
of
cameron
against
johnson
to
this
case.
first
of
all,
i
want
to
point
out
that
cameron
against
johnson
is
certainly
controlled
by
younger
and
by
samuels,
the
reason
being
that
cameron
was
a
pending
state
court
prosecution.
there
was
active
litigation
in
the
state
court.
the
petitioners
had
filed
an
affidavit
to
quash
on
the
grounds
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
next
of
all,
in
cameron
against
johnson,
the
district
court
did
in
fact
issue
a
declaratory
judgment.
but
the
declaratory
judgment
that
the
district
court
issued
was
one
which
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
mississippi’s
anti-picketing
statute.
next,
cameron
against
johnson
is
a
failure
of
proof
case
that
there
was
a
failure
of
the
petitioners
to
prove
bad
faith
or
harassment
or
even
selective
prosecution.
fourthly,
the
younger
and
samuels
standard
is
certainly
inappropriate
in
the
context
of
this
case.
that
is
of
a
threatened
prosecution
because
in
the
context
of
a
threatened
prosecution,
what
is
a
bad
faith
threat
to
enforce
a
statute
against
specific
conduct?
what
standards
can
be
devised
by
this
court
to
make
the
application
of
the
younger
and
samuels’
standards
manageable?
the
standard
in
the
context
of
a
then
prosecution
is
unreally
because
there’s
hardly
unimaginable
way
to
fashion
an
appropriate
standard.
i
take
for
example,
litigation
in
which
we
were
involved
in
georgia.
the
atlanta
vietnam
moratorium
committee
is
an
unreported
case
of
the
district
court.
and
there,
what
was
sought,
the
petitioners
sought
the
right
to
go
down
to
the
state
capital
and
hold
a
meeting
and
to
parade
and
have
a
demonstration
in
opposition
to
the
war.
and
they
notified
the
governor
of
their
intentions
of
what
they
plan
to
do
and
the
government
sent
them
back
a
telegram
and
in
this
telegram
he
said
in
part,
“you
will
be
permitted
to
host
such
a
meeting
on
the
capital
grounds
if
your
purpose
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
other
moratorium
meetings.
and
the
ones
planned
for
november
which
give
aid
and
assistance
to
the
enemies
of
this
country
which
downgrade
the
united
states
government
and
its
flag
and
which
are
directed
by
the
communist
and
other
enemies
of
this
country
with
the
support
of
vietcong,
you
nor
any
of
your
group
will
be
permitted
to
assemble
on
a
capital
ground
for
such
purposes.”
now,
is
that
a
good
faith?
is
that
a
good
bad
faith
threat
to
influence
georgia’s
trespass
statute?
without
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
what
remedy
would
the
petitioners
have
had
in
order
to
conduct
their
demonstration.
fortunately,
we
do
have
declaratory
judgment
and
the
district
court
did
issue
a
declaratory
judgment
saying
that
the
stated
conduct
of
the
sponsors
of
the
meeting
was
constitutionally
protected
and
that
the
governors
had
the
right
to
his
point
of
view
but
he
could
not
impose
his
point
of
view
on
the
sponsors
of
the
demonstration
so
as
to
deny
them
the
right
to
come
down
to
a
public
building
by
an
orderly
demonstrate
and
orderly
hold
the
meeting.
of
course,
he
would
--
he
could
take
action
against
them
if
their
conduct
went
beyond
that.
cause
violence,
obstruction,
and
things
that’s
all.
but
that
was
not
involved
it
was
purely
first
amendment
activities.
so
when
under
the
standard,
if
the
standard
of
younger
and
samuels
is
applied
to
a
non-threatened
--
to
a
threatened
prosecution,
when
can
the
district
court
reliably
determine
that
to
bad
faith
by
irreparable
harm
is
reliably
shown?
this
is
no
way
that
you
can
do
that.
unless
this
court
is
going
to
be
willing
to
cause
a
district
court
judges
to
try
the
state
of
mind
of
state
prosecutors
and
state
law
enforcement
agents
to
show
that
they
intend
to
actually
strike
the
threatened
law.
they
actually
intend
to
deprive
persons
of
their
constitutional
right.
then
we
get
into
a
serious
question
if
the
standard
is
extended
to
the
non-threatened,
to
the
threatened
rather
of
prosecution
of
case
and
controversy?
next,
with
respect
to
this
particular
case,
judge
tuttle
makes
it
clear
in
his
concurrence
in
steffel
that
it
was
a
pending
case.
and
he
relies
on
the
language
of
this
court
in
cameron
which
talks
about
withdrawing
the
determination
of
guilt
from
the
state
court.
and
the
only
reason
that
the
state
move
that
nature
could
be
made
is
because
there
was
a
pending
prosecution.
but
then
this
court
went
on
to
say
in
the
language
that
judge
tuttle
used
to
talk
about
securing
protection
which
a
prompt
trial
on
appeal
directly
to
this
court
would
provide.
however,
in
a
threatened
situation
there
is
no
prompt
trial.
there
is
no
appeal.
so
the
rubric,
the
technique
of
a
single
prosecution
being
dispositive
of
the
claims
does
not
work
and
cannot
work
in
a
threatened
prosecution.
the
reason
for
there
is
nothing
upon
which
it
must
be
cameron.
unless,
a
petitioner
such
as
steffel
is
required
to
break
the
law
and
it
does
not
seem
that
a
democratic
society
that
prior
to
itself
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty
would
require
actual
law
breaking
in
order
for
one
to
come
in
court.
now
in
a
similar
case
involving
a
similar
question
in
the
abortion
case,
the
doctors
and
the
women
who
were
seeking
abortions
and
had
not
actually
been
moved
against
under
the
state
statutes
were
allowed
to
enjoy
the
benefit
of
a
declaratory
judgment
in
those
cases.
so
i
think
that
basically,
that
cameron
against
johnson
is
not
controlling,
it
cannot
be
controlling
in
this
case
because
cameron
against
johnson
is
more
correctly
a
pending
prosecution
case.
to
move
on
where
i
was
--
where
i
left
of
before
recess,
another
distinguishing
factor
between
the
declaratory
judgment
and
injunctive
relief
is
that
the
state
can
disregard
a
declaratory
judgment
and
not
be
cited
for
contempt.
but
it
can
be
held
in
contempt
for
disregarding
an
injunction.
again,
in
the
abortion
cases,
this
court
relied
upon
the
obligation
under
the
constitution
of
state
officials
to
obey
decisions
of
this
court
which
are
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
and
to
obey
the
decisions
of
this
court
voluntarily.
i’ve
been
notified
that
my
time
is
about
to
expire.
in
such
time,
as
i
have,
i’d
like
to
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
several
things
in
rebuttal.
indeed,
as
applied
adjudications
have
less
dignity
than
facial
adjudications.
that
is
the
facial
constitutionality
of
statutes.
i
think
that
for
the
reason
that
they
do
have
less
dignity
that
they
should
be
rooted
into
the
district
court
where
it
is
appropriate
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
i
believe
it
makes
a
more
manageable
relationship
between
the
state
or
federal
court
and
it
unburdens
this
court
with
needless
applications
for
a
certiorari
which
may
be
substantial
questions
in
a
federal
district
court
but
not
necessarily
substantial
questions
warranting
to
exercise
by
this
court’s
certiorari
--
jurisdiction.
i
should
say
further
that
the
district
courts
are
familiar
with
the
exercise
of
the
declaratory
judgment
action
and
apply
the
situations
because
they
do
it
everyday
in
diversity
cases
where
insurance
companies
are
suing
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
particular
accident
is
within
the
coverage
of
the
policy.
why
then
should
federal
constitutional
rights
have
any
less
dignity
than
ordinary
personal
injury
of
case?
i
think
that
as
applied
to
adjudications
are
appropriate
for
rooting
in
to
the
district
court.
that’s
not
necessarily
a
question
to
be
decided
in
this
case.
additionally,
i
think
that
the
court
should
take
seriously
the
statement
of
judge
tuttle
with
respect
to
turning
federalism
on
its
head.
what
would
happen
here
if
this
court
were
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals?
it
would
create
a
situation
where
conduct
could
be
controlled
not
by
state
courts
but
rather
by
prosecutorial
officials
and
law
enforcement
officials.
the
rule
of
(inaudible)
would
really
become
a
statute.
take
for
example
in
steffel,
instead
of
being
an
outside
handbiller
where
a
tenant
in
the
shopping
center,
along
head
tenant
in
the
shopping
center
operating
an
ice
cream
stand
and
instead
of
operating
an
ice
cream
everyday
he
had
people
to
gather
into
his
ice
cream
stand
and
plan
protest
against
the
war,
ecological
protest,
support
in
behalf
of
women,
racial
rights,
racial
equality
and
takes
that
out.
but
yet
someone
and
the
police
did
not
like
what
mr.
steffel
were
doing
and
told
them
that
unless
he
seize
they
would
arrest
him
for
unlawful
assembly.
without
the
right
to
come
into
federal
court,
mr.
steffel
may
very
well
have
to
obey
the
admonishment
of
the
state
prosecutorial
official.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
he
is
a
tenant
and
of
course
there
would
be
greatest
sensitivity
and
receptivity
to
his
position
because
then
he
would
also
have
a
property
right
as
well
as
a
personal
right
of
liberty
but
there
is
a
tremendous
danger
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
would
be
pro
tanto
repeal
as
judge
tuttle
indicated
in
his
tremendous
danger
to
federalism
because
valuable
constitutional
rights
may
be
lost
and
there
would
be
no
remedy,
no
form
in
which
they
can
be
protected.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
[laughter]mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
the
example
is
that
it
illustrates
some
of
the
harms
and
real
issues
that
could
flow
from
withholding
the
right
to
seek
a
declaratory
judgment
where
there
is
a
non-pending
prosecution.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
not
actually.
what
he
is
actually
done
is
to
operate
a
business
but
his
sensitivity
--
he
is
sensitive
to
the
issues
of
the
day
and
he
devotes
himself
to
the
issues
of
the
day
rather
than
to
his
business
but
someone
is
offended
by
it.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
perhaps
to
customers
who
are
friend
of
his.
it
is
his
space,
he
is
a
tenant.
he
uses
it
as
a
he
pleases.
but
the
problem
is
that
if
declaratory
judgment
is
withheld
there
may
be
no
way
that
federalize
could
be
reliably
protected
and
that
he
would
have
to
obey
this
admonishment
against
perfectly
proper
and
constitutionally
protective
activity.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
well,
we
would
certainly
claim
that
police
officers
who
came
and
admonished
him
were
state
agents
and
the
question
is
--
the
question
then
would
become
whether
or
not
it
would
be
sufficient
state
action
based
upon
the
enforcement
apparently
in
good
faith.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
certainly
not,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
my
client
is
obeying
the
state
law.
he
staying
away
from
the
premises
is
in
deference
to
the
state
laws
as
enforced
by
the
state
agents.
they
actually
came
out.
the
police
actually
came
out.
the
state
police
came
out
and
told
mr.
steffel
to
leave
the
premises.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
i
don’t
quite
understand
the
question.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
howard
moore,
jr.
i
represent
the
petitioner
richard
guy
steffel.
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
judgment
of
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
that
judgment
affirmed
the
denial
of
declaratory
judgment
by
united
states
district
court,
the
northern
district
of
georgia,
in
an
action
in
which
a
declaratory
judgment
is
sought
against
the
threatened,
a
non-pending
state
criminal
prosecution
for
trespass
in
the
georgia
law
section
26
--
section
1503
26
georgia
code
annotated.
the
issue
presented
and
to
be
decided
by
this
court
is
whether
the
standard
set
forth
in
younger
v.
harris
and
samuel
--
samuels
against
mackell
may
be
applied
to
deny
a
petitioner
declaratory
relief
where
there
was
no
pending
state
criminal
prosecution.
the
factual
background
out
of
which
this
controversy
arises
is
as
follows,
there
were
impressively
two
events.
the
first
event
occurred
on
october
8,
1970.
the
petitioner
and
a
young
lady
by
the
name
of
sandra
becker,
both
members
of
an
incorporated
association
known
as
the
atlanta
mobilization
committee
stood
outside
on
the
exterior
sidewalks
of
a
food
store
located
in
the
north
dekalb
shopping
center.
their
purpose
for
their
being
there
was
to
participate
in
handbilling.
they
were
passing
out
handbills
to
invite
the
public
to
attend
an
anti-war
rally
in
downtown
atlanta
on
saturday,
october
31
to
solicit
support
for
the
atlanta
mobilization
committee
and
to
urge
support
for
the
lady's
boycott.
a
copy
of
a
handbill
which
they
were
handling
out
on
that
occasion
is
attached
to
the
appendix
at
page
13.
the
duration
of
the
handbilling
was
about
a
--
about
half
an
hour.
during
the
time
they
were
handbilling,
they
were
quiet
and
they
were
peaceful
and
there
was
no
unreasonable
littering,
if
any
littering
at
all.
the
handbilling
was
then
disrupted
by
the
shopping
center’s
security
guard,
who
ordered
the
petitioner
to
cease.
when
the
petitioner
explained
that
he
was
exercising
his
constitutional
right,
dekalb
county
police
were
called.
police
told
petitioner
and
mrs.
becker,
if
they
did
not
discontinue
that
peaceful
handbilling,
they
would
be
arrested.
the
petitioner
and
mrs.
becker
left
rather
than
being
arrested.
the
second
incident
occurred
on
october
10,
1970,
when
the
petitioner
and
mrs.
becker
distributed
handbills
from
10:30
a.m.
to
2:30
p.m.
about
four
hours
at
the
shopping
center.
they
conducted
themselves
on
that
occasion
in
an
orderly
and
peaceful
manner,
to
deny
the
view
of
the
shopping
center
or
commercial
activities
of
the
center
and
the
disruption
of
the
handbilling
occurred
again,
when
a
security
guard
told
the
petitioner
and
mrs.
becker
to
cease
handbilling
and
leave.
the
manager
of
the
shopping
center
called
the
dekalb
police.
the
police
came
again,
the
petitioner
left,
mrs.
becker
refused
to
leave
and
she
was
arrested.
on
the
16th
of
october,
the
petitioner
began
his
efforts
at
judicial
relief
or
redress,
by
filing
a
complaint
in
the
united
states
district
court
to
the
northern
district
of
georgia
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief
on
the
grounds
of
section
1503
of
the
georgia
code
as
applied
to
his
and
mrs.
becker’s
conduct
deprived
them
of
the
first
amendment
rights.
a
hearing,
an
evidentiary
hearing
was
held
on
october
28,
1970
and
the
court
then
later
in
january
of
1971,
state
further
proceedings
in
the
case
to
await
the
decision
of
this
court
in
samuels
against
mackell
and
other
cases
which
the
court
mentioned
in
its
decision.
then
following
the
decision
in
younger
and
samuels,
the
district
judge
applied
younger
and
samuels
to
deny
the
petitioner
of
relief.
although
petitioner
was
won
against
them,
there
was
no
pending
criminal
prosecution.
the
district
judge
was
of
the
opinion
that
the
petitioner
had
failed
to
show
irreparable
injury
as
defined
by
this
court
and
the
defendants’
claim
lack
the
rudiments
of
an
active
controversy.
steffel
then
appealed.
mrs.
becker
and
the
atlanta
mobilization
committee
who
were
petitioners
in
the
district
court
did
not
appeal.
the
district
court
in
a
divided
opinion,
applied
younger
and
samuels
to
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
was
of
the
opinion
and
stated
in
his
opinion
that
that
was
no
different
in
effect
in
a
declaratory
judgment
where
there
was
no
--
where
there
was
not
a
pending
criminal
action.
then
there
was
in
one
point
there
was
a
pending
criminal
action.
and
it
saw
no
difference
in
reasoning
and
therefore
applied
younger
and
samuels
to
this
case.
judge
tuttle
dissented
from
the
extension
of
younger
and
samuels
to
this
case
but
he
concurred
in
the
results
on
a
different
ground.
judge
tuttle
would
have
affirmed
on
the
authority
of
cameron
against
johnson.
a
motion
was
filed
for
rehearing
and
the
rehearing
was
denied,
three
judges
dissented
from
the
denial
of
the
rehearing
and
their
opinion
is
before
the
court.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
certainly.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
the
judge
said
he
like
to
rudiment
of
an
act
controversy.
that
was
the
finding
of
the
district
court.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
it
ignored
it.
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
persuaded
that
there
was
an
act
of
controversy
as
defined
by
this
court
that
the
fact
showed
that
it
is
substantial.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
he
didn’t
say
so
but
it
proceeded
anyway
to
make
a
determination
about
younger
and
samuels.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
it
is
certainly,
it
is
certainly
could
be
but
i
do
not
think
that
it's
dispositive
because
i
think
that
on
this
facts,
there
is
a
substantial
showing
between
parties
of
having
adverse
interest
of
an
immediate
controversy
with
reality.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
they
said
they
like
the
rudiments.
the
district
court
didn’t
say
what
rudiments
were
missing?
it
made
no
findings
that
made
a
conclusion
but
not
defining
the
fact.
it
didn’t
show
what
would
fact
upon
which
it
found
if
the
rudiments
were
missing.
there
is
no
statement
of
facts
there.
i
think
that
was
clearly
erroneous,
clearly
wrong
because
the
petitioner
on
two
occasions
had
been
actually
threatened
with
the
enforcement
of
this
specific
statute
not
with
some
different
statute.
but
he
himself
on
two
occasions
was
threatened
with
the
statute
and
it
is
a
force
of
that
statute
and
his
obedience
to
that
statute
that
has
prevented
him
from
returning
to
the
shopping
center
to
handbill
so
there
is
that
adversity
of
interest
because
he
would
like
very
much
to
go
out
and
handbill.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
i
would
think
--
i
hope
so.[laughter
attempt]
the
court
of
appeal
did
not
say
so,
but
i
think
that
there
is
enough
in
the
record
on
the
facts
where
this
court
can
meet
that
question.
it
is
the
petitioner’s
position
that
the
younger
--
samuels
standards
were
incorrectly
applied
to
this
case.
in
the
context
of
a
threatened
prosecution,
the
application
of
the
younger
and
samuels’s
standards
of
irreparable
injury
are
inappropriate
and
they’re
inappropriate
for
a
number
of
reasons.
the
majority,
i
should
say
that
the
majority
of
the
lower
courts
have
with
the
exception
of
the
fifth
circuit,
refused
to
apply
younger
and
samuels
rule
of
equitable
non-intervention
to
situations
such
as
this.
the
restraining
principles
of
comity
which
in
younger
and
samuels
are
inapplicable
where
the
relief
requested
poses
no
threat
to
an
on-going
state
proceeding
either
criminal
or
non-criminal.
as
a
practical
--
a
comity
is
not
an
absolute
value.
as
a
practical
matter,
some
balancing
must
be
allowed
to
ensure
that
fundamental
federal
rights
are
not
lost
by
blind
compliance
with
comity.
the
purposes
underlying
the
development
of
this
principle
which
include
the
avoidance
of
conflict
with
two
courts,
seeking
to
dispose
of
a
same
case
in
respect
for
the
state
courts
in
the
context
of
a
threatened
criminal
--
threatened
prosecution.
in
samuels,
it
was
held
that
there
is
no
difference
between
declaratory
relief
and
injunctions
with
the
respect
to
the
disrupted
impact
each
on
the
pending
state
prosecution.
the
purpose
for
equating
the
two
forms
of
relief
was
to
require
a
showing
of
irreparable
injury.
in
the
context
of
a
pending
state
court
proceeding,
there
may
be
pragmatic
reasons
for
requiring
such
a
showing.
these
reasons,
i
submit
to
--
would
include
additional
cause
to
judicial
system
of
two
on-going
proceedings
involving
essentially
the
same
subject
matter.
stopping
of
an
on-going
proceeding
where
a
jurisdiction
has
vested
in
the
state
court
and
the
effect
of
judicial
intervention
by
the
federal
court
is
to
rest
away,
to
take
away
from
a
state
court
a
matter
over
which
each
jurisdiction
has
rested
and
you
run
into
a
principle
that
does
not
necessarily
have
to
be
respected
in
all
cases
that
ordinarily
you
don’t
rest
away
jurisdiction
from
a
court
once
it
has
vested.
you
have
then
an
indictment
of
a
state
process
because
implicit
and
federal
intervention
where
there
is
[interruption]
going
on,
is
that
in
some
way
the
state
prosecution
is
inadequate
or
that
the
state
prosecution
is
in
bad
faith
or
that
the
state
judges
are
corrupt,
that
the
state
fact-finding
proceeding
is
inaccurate
--
is
inadequate.
there
are
many
of
variables
enacted
--
referred
to
and
that
familiar
to
this
court
but
it
is
an
indictment.
it
is
a
slander
so
to
speak
of
the
state
processes.
another
reason
is
the
duplication
of
efforts
in
the
disruption
the
status
quo.
these
reasons
are
not
as
compelling
where
a
state
prosecution
has
only
been
threatened.
when
no
state
court
action
is
pending
there
is
no
assurance
the
constitutional
rights
will
receive
time
and
attention.
this
case
is
an
example
of
that.
it
has
been
now
over
three
years
and
steffel
still
has
not
got
any
determination
of
his
rights.
he
still
can’t
return
to
the
shopping
center
for
the
purposes
of
handbilling.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
no,
he
did
not.
georgia
law
by
statute
and
by
court
decision
prohibits
the
intermeddling
of
equity
and
administration
to
criminal
law
and
the
georgia
cases
have
refused
to
accept
jurisdiction
over
matters
involving
the
enforcement
of
criminal
law.
now,
recently
more
than
two
years
after
this
incident,
the
shopping
center
filed
an
action
for
declaratory
judgment
in
the
superior
court
of
fulton
county.
that
action
was
dismissed
for
failure
to
state
a
claim
among
other
reasons.
one
of
the
other
reasons
for
dismissing
it
was
that
there
was
primary
jurisdiction
before,
i
think
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
because
the
union
was
about
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
the
defendant
lives
is
in
fulton
county
and
there
is
a
residence
requirement.
you
have
to
file
in
the
residence
where
the
defendant
is
and
that’s
why
it
was
filed
in
fulton
county.
and
there
is
an
appeal
pending
now
by
the
shopping
center
to
the
georgia
supreme
court
and
that
appeal
will
be
heard
on
the
15th
which
is
thursday,
friday
i
believe.
where
irreparable
harm
to
criteria
for
declaratory
relief,
rights
and
doubt
may
be
sacrificed
due
to
the
difficulty
in
making
such
a
showing,
the
decision
that
irreparable
harm
should
not
be
a
criterion
for
declaratory
relief
when
no
state
action
is
pending
is
supported
by
legislative
intent
by
case
history
and
by
the
ways
the
chief
architect
of
the
federal
declaratory
judgment,
professor
borchard.
federal
intervention
when
the
state
prosecution
is
threatened
is
less
disruptive
of
the
state’s
activities
and
similar
intervention
when
a
prosecution
is
pending.
a
decree
of
federal
equitable
relief
would
interfere
only
with
the
policing
and
prosecutorial
function
of
the
state’s
executive
branch.
when
the
prosecution
is
pending
however,
federal
intervention
interferes
further
with
the
activities
of
its
judiciary.
the
dual
interests
of
the
federal
court
in
eliminating
threats
for
constitutional
violations
and
in
avoiding
unnecessary
police
interference
might
both
be
protected
by
directing
appropriate
orders
to
responsible
officials
they
could
correct
the
situation
internally
themselves.
if
there's
a
declaratory
relief
in
a
non-pending
situation
is
that
its
non-coercive
effect
allows
law
enforcement
officials
to
continue
to
function.
now,
declaratory
judgment
and
injunctive
relief
should
be
distinguished.
a
declaratory
judgment
can
be
distinguished
from
the
equitable
relief
of
an
injunction
in
several
respects
and
i
should
indicate
that
declaratory
judgment
is
not
a
legal
remedy,
not
an
equitable
remedy
rather
but
it's
a
legal
remedy.
some
of
the
distinguishing
factors
are
is
that,
one,
a
lack
of
an
adequate
legal
remedy
is
a
pre-requisite
for
injunctive
relief
but
is
not
a
criterion
for
declaratory
relief,
rule
57
on
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
points
this
out.
this
has
been
a
tradition
--
a
traditional
and
ancient,
a
requirement
for
the
intervention
of
equity
that
that
be
an
absence
of
an
adequate
remedy
at
law
or
other
appropriate
remedy
at
law.
that
was
traditionally
the
way
that
the
interest
of
equity
was
balanced
against
the
interest
of
the
lower
court
and
gave
rise
more
or
less
to
the
equity
course
by
preventing
embarrassment
--
showing
the
ineffectiveness
of
equity
by
introducing
or
by
decreeing
an
order
that
could
not
be
enforced.
by
granting
declaratory
relief,
the
petitioner
need
not
show
the
inappropriateness
of
other
forms
of
relief.
the
petitioner
need
only
show
that
the
declaratory
judgment
can
handle
the
dispute
efficiently
and
economically.
injunctive
relief
immunizes
particular
conduct
by
enjoining
further
prosecution
whereas
a
declaration
merely
interprets
the
law
and
has
no
injunctive
effect.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
well,
it’s
not
completely
abstract
because
this
court
as
well
as
the
statute,
the
declaratory
judgment
statute
has
defined
standards
to
determine
when
a
controversy
exists
over
which
the
district
court
can
assume
jurisdiction.
so
it’s
not
all
together
abstract
that
requires
an
exercise
of
judgment,
discretion
by
the
district
judge,
whomever
is
determining
the
matter
but
it’s
not
entirely
abstract.
and
in
the
logic
of
consequences
of
the
position
of
case
and
controversy
would
be
perhaps
to
repeal
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
if
the
case
in
controversy
is
standard
isn’t
given
a
real
life
content
would
mean
--
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
i
understand
that.
but
--
i’m
simply
saying
that
the
case
in
controversy
standard
has
to
be
applied
against
the
background
of
declaratory
judgment
act
and
to
be
too
restrictive
in
the
case
of
controversy
would
result,
could
result
in
repealing
the
declaratory
judgment
action.
and
whether
that
would
be
statutory
or
not,
is
not
a
question.
i
think
that’s
really
involved
in
this
question
of
the
case.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
that
is
a
good
question
for
us.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
resume,
i
would
like
to
resume
with
the
question
put
to
me
by
mr.
justice
blackmun
with
respect
to
the
application
of
cameron
against
johnson
to
this
case.
first
of
all,
i
want
to
point
out
that
cameron
against
johnson
is
certainly
controlled
by
younger
and
by
samuels,
the
reason
being
that
cameron
was
a
pending
state
court
prosecution.
there
was
active
litigation
in
the
state
court.
the
petitioners
had
filed
an
affidavit
to
quash
on
the
grounds
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
next
of
all,
in
cameron
against
johnson,
the
district
court
did
in
fact
issue
a
declaratory
judgment.
but
the
declaratory
judgment
that
the
district
court
issued
was
one
which
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
mississippi’s
anti-picketing
statute.
next,
cameron
against
johnson
is
a
failure
of
proof
case
that
there
was
a
failure
of
the
petitioners
to
prove
bad
faith
or
harassment
or
even
selective
prosecution.
fourthly,
the
younger
and
samuels
standard
is
certainly
inappropriate
in
the
context
of
this
case.
that
is
of
a
threatened
prosecution
because
in
the
context
of
a
threatened
prosecution,
what
is
a
bad
faith
threat
to
enforce
a
statute
against
specific
conduct?
what
standards
can
be
devised
by
this
court
to
make
the
application
of
the
younger
and
samuels’
standards
manageable?
the
standard
in
the
context
of
a
then
prosecution
is
unreally
because
there’s
hardly
unimaginable
way
to
fashion
an
appropriate
standard.
i
take
for
example,
litigation
in
which
we
were
involved
in
georgia.
the
atlanta
vietnam
moratorium
committee
is
an
unreported
case
of
the
district
court.
and
there,
what
was
sought,
the
petitioners
sought
the
right
to
go
down
to
the
state
capital
and
hold
a
meeting
and
to
parade
and
have
a
demonstration
in
opposition
to
the
war.
and
they
notified
the
governor
of
their
intentions
of
what
they
plan
to
do
and
the
government
sent
them
back
a
telegram
and
in
this
telegram
he
said
in
part,
“you
will
be
permitted
to
host
such
a
meeting
on
the
capital
grounds
if
your
purpose
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
other
moratorium
meetings.
and
the
ones
planned
for
november
which
give
aid
and
assistance
to
the
enemies
of
this
country
which
downgrade
the
united
states
government
and
its
flag
and
which
are
directed
by
the
communist
and
other
enemies
of
this
country
with
the
support
of
vietcong,
you
nor
any
of
your
group
will
be
permitted
to
assemble
on
a
capital
ground
for
such
purposes.”
now,
is
that
a
good
faith?
is
that
a
good
bad
faith
threat
to
influence
georgia’s
trespass
statute?
without
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
what
remedy
would
the
petitioners
have
had
in
order
to
conduct
their
demonstration.
fortunately,
we
do
have
declaratory
judgment
and
the
district
court
did
issue
a
declaratory
judgment
saying
that
the
stated
conduct
of
the
sponsors
of
the
meeting
was
constitutionally
protected
and
that
the
governors
had
the
right
to
his
point
of
view
but
he
could
not
impose
his
point
of
view
on
the
sponsors
of
the
demonstration
so
as
to
deny
them
the
right
to
come
down
to
a
public
building
by
an
orderly
demonstrate
and
orderly
hold
the
meeting.
of
course,
he
would
--
he
could
take
action
against
them
if
their
conduct
went
beyond
that.
cause
violence,
obstruction,
and
things
that’s
all.
but
that
was
not
involved
it
was
purely
first
amendment
activities.
so
when
under
the
standard,
if
the
standard
of
younger
and
samuels
is
applied
to
a
non-threatened
--
to
a
threatened
prosecution,
when
can
the
district
court
reliably
determine
that
to
bad
faith
by
irreparable
harm
is
reliably
shown?
this
is
no
way
that
you
can
do
that.
unless
this
court
is
going
to
be
willing
to
cause
a
district
court
judges
to
try
the
state
of
mind
of
state
prosecutors
and
state
law
enforcement
agents
to
show
that
they
intend
to
actually
strike
the
threatened
law.
they
actually
intend
to
deprive
persons
of
their
constitutional
right.
then
we
get
into
a
serious
question
if
the
standard
is
extended
to
the
non-threatened,
to
the
threatened
rather
of
prosecution
of
case
and
controversy?
next,
with
respect
to
this
particular
case,
judge
tuttle
makes
it
clear
in
his
concurrence
in
steffel
that
it
was
a
pending
case.
and
he
relies
on
the
language
of
this
court
in
cameron
which
talks
about
withdrawing
the
determination
of
guilt
from
the
state
court.
and
the
only
reason
that
the
state
move
that
nature
could
be
made
is
because
there
was
a
pending
prosecution.
but
then
this
court
went
on
to
say
in
the
language
that
judge
tuttle
used
to
talk
about
securing
protection
which
a
prompt
trial
on
appeal
directly
to
this
court
would
provide.
however,
in
a
threatened
situation
there
is
no
prompt
trial.
there
is
no
appeal.
so
the
rubric,
the
technique
of
a
single
prosecution
being
dispositive
of
the
claims
does
not
work
and
cannot
work
in
a
threatened
prosecution.
the
reason
for
there
is
nothing
upon
which
it
must
be
cameron.
unless,
a
petitioner
such
as
steffel
is
required
to
break
the
law
and
it
does
not
seem
that
a
democratic
society
that
prior
to
itself
in
the
concept
of
ordered
liberty
would
require
actual
law
breaking
in
order
for
one
to
come
in
court.
now
in
a
similar
case
involving
a
similar
question
in
the
abortion
case,
the
doctors
and
the
women
who
were
seeking
abortions
and
had
not
actually
been
moved
against
under
the
state
statutes
were
allowed
to
enjoy
the
benefit
of
a
declaratory
judgment
in
those
cases.
so
i
think
that
basically,
that
cameron
against
johnson
is
not
controlling,
it
cannot
be
controlling
in
this
case
because
cameron
against
johnson
is
more
correctly
a
pending
prosecution
case.
to
move
on
where
i
was
--
where
i
left
of
before
recess,
another
distinguishing
factor
between
the
declaratory
judgment
and
injunctive
relief
is
that
the
state
can
disregard
a
declaratory
judgment
and
not
be
cited
for
contempt.
but
it
can
be
held
in
contempt
for
disregarding
an
injunction.
again,
in
the
abortion
cases,
this
court
relied
upon
the
obligation
under
the
constitution
of
state
officials
to
obey
decisions
of
this
court
which
are
the
supreme
law
of
the
land
and
to
obey
the
decisions
of
this
court
voluntarily.
i’ve
been
notified
that
my
time
is
about
to
expire.
in
such
time,
as
i
have,
i’d
like
to
reserve
it
for
rebuttal.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
several
things
in
rebuttal.
indeed,
as
applied
adjudications
have
less
dignity
than
facial
adjudications.
that
is
the
facial
constitutionality
of
statutes.
i
think
that
for
the
reason
that
they
do
have
less
dignity
that
they
should
be
rooted
into
the
district
court
where
it
is
appropriate
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
i
believe
it
makes
a
more
manageable
relationship
between
the
state
or
federal
court
and
it
unburdens
this
court
with
needless
applications
for
a
certiorari
which
may
be
substantial
questions
in
a
federal
district
court
but
not
necessarily
substantial
questions
warranting
to
exercise
by
this
court’s
certiorari
--
jurisdiction.
i
should
say
further
that
the
district
courts
are
familiar
with
the
exercise
of
the
declaratory
judgment
action
and
apply
the
situations
because
they
do
it
everyday
in
diversity
cases
where
insurance
companies
are
suing
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
particular
accident
is
within
the
coverage
of
the
policy.
why
then
should
federal
constitutional
rights
have
any
less
dignity
than
ordinary
personal
injury
of
case?
i
think
that
as
applied
to
adjudications
are
appropriate
for
rooting
in
to
the
district
court.
that’s
not
necessarily
a
question
to
be
decided
in
this
case.
additionally,
i
think
that
the
court
should
take
seriously
the
statement
of
judge
tuttle
with
respect
to
turning
federalism
on
its
head.
what
would
happen
here
if
this
court
were
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals?
it
would
create
a
situation
where
conduct
could
be
controlled
not
by
state
courts
but
rather
by
prosecutorial
officials
and
law
enforcement
officials.
the
rule
of
(inaudible)
would
really
become
a
statute.
take
for
example
in
steffel,
instead
of
being
an
outside
handbiller
where
a
tenant
in
the
shopping
center,
along
head
tenant
in
the
shopping
center
operating
an
ice
cream
stand
and
instead
of
operating
an
ice
cream
everyday
he
had
people
to
gather
into
his
ice
cream
stand
and
plan
protest
against
the
war,
ecological
protest,
support
in
behalf
of
women,
racial
rights,
racial
equality
and
takes
that
out.
but
yet
someone
and
the
police
did
not
like
what
mr.
steffel
were
doing
and
told
them
that
unless
he
seize
they
would
arrest
him
for
unlawful
assembly.
without
the
right
to
come
into
federal
court,
mr.
steffel
may
very
well
have
to
obey
the
admonishment
of
the
state
prosecutorial
official.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
he
is
a
tenant
and
of
course
there
would
be
greatest
sensitivity
and
receptivity
to
his
position
because
then
he
would
also
have
a
property
right
as
well
as
a
personal
right
of
liberty
but
there
is
a
tremendous
danger
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
would
be
pro
tanto
repeal
as
judge
tuttle
indicated
in
his
tremendous
danger
to
federalism
because
valuable
constitutional
rights
may
be
lost
and
there
would
be
no
remedy,
no
form
in
which
they
can
be
protected.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
[laughter]mr.
justice
--
mr.
chief
justice,
the
example
is
that
it
illustrates
some
of
the
harms
and
real
issues
that
could
flow
from
withholding
the
right
to
seek
a
declaratory
judgment
where
there
is
a
non-pending
prosecution.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
not
actually.
what
he
is
actually
done
is
to
operate
a
business
but
his
sensitivity
--
he
is
sensitive
to
the
issues
of
the
day
and
he
devotes
himself
to
the
issues
of
the
day
rather
than
to
his
business
but
someone
is
offended
by
it.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
perhaps
to
customers
who
are
friend
of
his.
it
is
his
space,
he
is
a
tenant.
he
uses
it
as
a
he
pleases.
but
the
problem
is
that
if
declaratory
judgment
is
withheld
there
may
be
no
way
that
federalize
could
be
reliably
protected
and
that
he
would
have
to
obey
this
admonishment
against
perfectly
proper
and
constitutionally
protective
activity.
thank
you.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
well,
we
would
certainly
claim
that
police
officers
who
came
and
admonished
him
were
state
agents
and
the
question
is
--
the
question
then
would
become
whether
or
not
it
would
be
sufficient
state
action
based
upon
the
enforcement
apparently
in
good
faith.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
certainly
not,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
because
my
client
is
obeying
the
state
law.
he
staying
away
from
the
premises
is
in
deference
to
the
state
laws
as
enforced
by
the
state
agents.
they
actually
came
out.
the
police
actually
came
out.
the
state
police
came
out
and
told
mr.
steffel
to
leave
the
premises.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
i
don’t
quite
understand
the
question.
mr.
howard
moore,
jr.
thank
you.
