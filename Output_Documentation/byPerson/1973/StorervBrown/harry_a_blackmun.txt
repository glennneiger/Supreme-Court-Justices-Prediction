mr.
halvonik,
do
i
understand
from
what
you’ve
just
said
that
your
posing
your
case
basically
on
the
first
amendment
principles
and
not
at
all
on
equal
protection?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
are
claiming
a
denial
of
freedom
of
association
here
as
i
understand
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
the
answer
to
that
is
not
that
he
is
merely
asked
to
forgo
the
vote
and
he
can
associate
all
he
wants
to?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
all
of
these
sounds
to
me
more
like
fourteenth
amendment
than
first
i
think
but
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
roche,
do
i
not
detect
the
disagreement
between
your
position
and
that
of
your
opponent's
so
far
as
participation
in
the
nonpartisan
primary
leads
to
disqualification?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
it
your
position
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
i
correctly
detect
your
opponent’s
position
to
be
the
contrary
of
this?
that
is
only
in
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
roche,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
while
they
are
going
on.
i
am
having
some
conceptual
difficulty.
as
i
remember
williams
against
rhodes,
this
court
approached
it
on
a
standard
of
totality
of
the
circumstances.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
as
i
remember
the
jenness
case,
we
didn’t
know
such
thing.
we
approached
it
on
provision
by
provision
separately.
do
you
think
those
cases
are
reconcilable
in
theory
and
if
not,
which
path
we
should
follow
here?
i
asked
this
because
you
have
been
taking
provision
by
provision
as
you
are
going
along.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
think
it
wasn’t
done
in
jenness
against
fortson?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
doesn’t
make
any
difference.
in
any
event
here,
you
are
arguing
the
totality
(voice
overlap)
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
if
we
do
that,
then
why
is
it
necessary
to
argue
as
you
are
arguing
now
to
take
up
each
provisions
separately?
