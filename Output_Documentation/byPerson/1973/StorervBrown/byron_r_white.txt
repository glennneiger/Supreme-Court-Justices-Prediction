in

cases
there
is
an
appeal
from
a
three-judge
district
court
judgment,
holding
various
provisions
of
a
california
election
code
constitutional.
the
provisions
in
general
regulate
the
access
of
independent
candidates
to
the
ballot.
insofar
as
the
storer
and
frommhagen
are
concerned,
they
were
bared
from
the

the

forbidding
independent
candidates
from
running
as
independents
if
they
had
been
affiliated
with
a
authorized
political
party
within
a
specified
time
prior
to
the
primary

agree
with

valid,
