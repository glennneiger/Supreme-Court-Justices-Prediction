brennan,
jr.
because
he
voted
at
what
is
a
primary
election
and
held
on
the
same
day
as
a
primary
election,
although
it
itself
was
not
a
primary
election,
is
that
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i’ve
always
understood
a
primary
election
to
be
one
where
there
are
candidates
for
the
nomination
of
a
particular
party
and
i
vote
for
one
or
the
other
candidate,
but
that’s
not
what
you’re
talking
about?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no,
but
at
the
time
of
the
election
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
at
the
election
we’re
talking
about.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
there
were
candidates
for
nomination
in
the
both
republican
and
the
democratic
parties
or
perhaps
for
other
parties?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
for
some,
and
then
in
addition
to
that
though
these
nonpartisan
things
that
you
–-
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
it
is
still
called
a
primary
election?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
anyone
who
voted,
if
he
voted
only
on
the
matter
of
those
initiative
or
whatever
those
propositions
where,
that
then
disqualified
him
from
signing
one
of
these
petitions
after
august
15,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
let
me
ask,
to
what
does
the
5%
in
number
apply?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
now,
for
the
purposes
of
the
cases
we
have
before
us,
what
was
the
elimination
from
the
5%
by
virtue
of
having
voted
at
the
primary
election
--
in
numbers?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
then
you
have
to
get
5%
of
the
total
out
of
the
30%?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
thought
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
does
that
opinion
use
the
term
fundamental
right
or
constitutional
right?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
why
you
don’t.
justice
william
j.
