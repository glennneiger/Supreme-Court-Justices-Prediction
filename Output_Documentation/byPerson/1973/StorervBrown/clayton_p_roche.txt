mr.
clayton
p.
roche
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
our
basic
position
is
completely
different
of
course
than
the
appellants.
the
appellants
have
very
studiously
avoided
this
court’s
decision
in
jenness
versus
fortson
and
it
is
our
position
that
we
look
to
jenness
versus
fortson
for
the
guidelines
as
to
how
california’s
law
and
its
constitutionality
should
be
decided.
it
is
clear
when
we
look
at
california’s
law
that
california
has
preserved
the
fluidity
of
political
life
and
has
not
frozen
the
status
quo.
that
was
the
key
to
jenness
versus
fortson.
as
alluded
to
by
appellants
very
rapidly
as
we
--
in
their
argument,
california
has
not
two
parties,
but
has
four
qualified
parties
presently.
besides
the
democratic
and
republicans,
we
have
the
american
independent
party
and
the
peace
and
freedom
party.
so
obviously,
we
are
not
a
williams
versus
rhodes
situation
where
the
political
life
of
california
has
been
a
frozen
for
the
democrats
and
republicans.
also,
there’s
been
little
said
about
section
6430
of
the
california
elections
code.
we
feel
that
section
6430
of
elections
code
in
and
of
itself
without
even
reference
to
the
independent
nomination
procedure
satisfies
all
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
appellants
and
other
electors
in
california.
under
said
provisions
as
has
been
explained
an
old
party
can
remain
on
the
ballot
if
it
gets
2%
of
the
previous
vote.
secondly,
if
they
have
1%
registration
as
of
135
days
before
the
election,
they
also
become
a
qualified
party.
additionally,
they
can
become
a
qualified
party
by
getting
a
petition
with
10%
of
the
number
of
voters
at
the
last
gubernatorial
election.
we
also
have
the
ride-in
process
in
all
elections:
primary,
general,
state
and
local
offices,
federal
office
and
the
presidential
elections.
so,
we
haven’t
even
gotten
into
the
independent
nomination
procedure
so
obviously,
if
any
group
of
electors
wishes
to
organize
and
exercise
their
first
amendment
rights
under
the
provisions
of
section
6430
of
the
elections
code,
they
may
do
so
as
did
the
american
independent
party
and
the
peace
and
freedom
party
in
1948.
also
in
the
past,
we
have
had
other
qualified
parties
as
alluded
to
in
our
brief.
we
have
had
the
--
in
the
50’s
we
had
--
and
into
the
60’s,
the
progressive,
excuse
me,
the
prohibition
party
was
a
qualified
party
and
also
for
a
while
we
had
the,
i
believe
was
the
progressive
independent
party
in
the
50’s.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
1%
of
the
registration.
now
the
1/15
is
an
additional
qualification
to
stay
on
the
ballot.
there
is
a
provision
in
section
6430
that
says
“and
if
at
any
time
that
the
registration
falls
within
1/15
of
1%,
then
they
are
automatically
off
no
matter
what
they
got
the
last
time.”
now,
that’s
interesting
from
the
point
of
view
that
in
georgia
--
in
looking
at
georgia’s
5%
of
the
vote,
last
vote
requirement,
they
could
have
had
zero
because
they
do
not
have
that
added
qualification
and
the
court
still
upheld
georgia’s
5%
requirement
in
jenness
versus
fortson.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
oh,
well
in
other
words
–-
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
well,
a
party
can
stay
--
that
is
right,
it
is
--
no,
they
could
have
zero.
it
would
be
more
restrictive
in
that
even
if
they
have
zero
registration,
even
if
the
had
20%,
excuse
me,
not
the
5%,
the
20%
of
the
vote
requirement
for
an
old
party
of
the
stay
on.
their
registration
could
go
down
to
zero
and
they
would
still
have
been
a
qualified
party.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
so
basically
what
i’m
saying
is
that
without
reference
to
the
independent
nomination
procedure
itself,
the
fluidity
of
political
life
is
taking
care
of
in
california.
now,
insofar
as
the
–-
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
thank
you,
your
honor.
as
i
was
saying
before
lunch,
i
was
outlining
how
under
the
provisions
of
section
6430
of
the
california
elections
code,
the
fluidity
of
political
life
is
preserved
without
even
reference
to
the
independent
nomination
procedure
which
is
solely
attack
in
this
particular
lawsuit.
additionally
of
course,
we
have
the
ride-in
process
in
all
elections.
so
therefore,
we
get
to
the
question
what
scope
of
review
should
be
used
here
and
it
is
our
position
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
section
6430
takes
in
addition
and
in
conjunction
with
the
ride-in
process
already
preserves
the
constitutional
rights
of
electors
in
california.
that
the
independent
nomination
procedure
really
essentially
has
its
existence
or
now
has
very
little
impact
upon
the
voters
in
california.
therefore,
under
the
test
set
forth
by
this
court
in
bullock
versus
carter,
the
rational
basis
test
should
be
used
in
examining
its
provisions
instead
of
the
close
scrutiny
test
and
in
this
regard
it
would
seem
that
we
are
essentially
talking
about
a
case
which
involves
barriers
to
candidacy
as
opposed
to
the
right
to
vote
per
se
as
found
in
such
cases
is
carrington
versus
rash
and
the
kramer
case,
the
cipriano
case
and
so
forth
which
were
direct
infringements
upon
and
that
direct
disenfranchisements.
however,
despite
the
fact
that
we
feel
that
only
the
rational
basis
test
need
be
used,
we
feel
that
even
should
we
examine
the
california
independent
nomination
procedure
in
a
vacuum
so
to
speak
that
each
of
its
substantive
provisions
are
necessary
to
further
compelling
state
interests
of
the
state.
now
taking
these
elements
individually,
we
first
of
all
have
the
5%
signature
requirement
of
section
6831.
well,
of
course,
this
court
has
recognized
unqualifiedly
that
in
jenness
versus
fortson
that
a
significant
modicum
of
support
is
proper
to
prevent
proliferation
of
the
ballot
and
to
also
prevent
confusion,
deception
and
even
frustration
of
our
electoral
system.
three-judge
district
courts
have
elevated
this
in
itself
to
a
compelling
state
interest.
for
example,
beniger
versus
ogilvie
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
the
beller
versus
kirk
which
was
affirmed
sub
nom
beller
versus
askew
by
this
court.
in
fact,
when
you
examine
california’s
5%
requirement
vis-à-vis
georgia’s
5%
requirements,
you
will
find
that
california’s
5%
requirement
is
really
about
a
3-1/2%
requirement,
because
georgia
uses
a
different
test.
georgia
used
a
test
of
all
of
the
electors
who
were
qualified
to
vote
at
the
last
election
whereas
california
uses
the
test
all
those
people
who
actually
voted
for
that
office
then
using
the
70%
test
that
the
appellant’s
use
all
the
time,
that
would
come
out
to
about
a
3-1/2%
requirement
on
georgia’s
scale
instead
of
a
5%
requirement.
additionally,
we
point
out
that
appellants
apparently
do
not
seriously
even
contest
the
5%
requirement
in
and
of
itself
and
we
presume
the
difficult
for
them
to
do
because
of
jenness
versus
fortson
and
cases
as
such
as
--
excuse
me,
not
beniger
versus
ogilvie,
it
was
jackson
versus
ogilvie
and
beller
versus
kirk.
now,
moving
on
to
the
6830
(c)
of
the
california
elections
code
wherein
it
restricts
the
signatories
to
those
who
have
not
voted
at
the
primary
election.
now,
there
was
much
of
discussion
as
to
what
is
a
primary
election
in
california.
now
our
position
below
at
the
district
court
level
was
that
in
california,
the
primary
election
held
in
june
is
in
reality,
a
series
of
primary
elections.
it’s
essentially
a
consolidation
of
a
group
of
primary
elections,
one
for
each
parties.
therefore
in
1972,
we
would
have
had
a
primary
election
for
four
parties
and
a
separate
primary
election,
basically
for
“declines
to
state.”
now,
we
have
cited
a
case,
a
california
case
–-
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
oh!
no.
it’s
all
at
the
same
time
and
–-
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
yes
sir.
but
there
are
separate
ballots
for
each
party
and
each
party
essentially
holds
its
primary
election,
then
the
“declines
to
state”
also
nominates
nonpartisan
officers
such
as
county
supervisors
and
then
as
was
explained
there
are
usually
a
proliferation
of
ballot
propositions
that
we
all
struggle
with
at
least
twice
a
year.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
that
was
our
position
below
your
honor
that
i
feel
that
–-
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
if
required
to
sustain
the
constitutionality,
that
would
be
my
position,
yes
sir.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
i
understand
it
that
--
unfortunately,
the
district
court
considered
the
primary
as
single
election.
well,
it
is
difficult
to
argue
any
purpose
which
would
be
served
by
excluding
those
who
have
voted
a
nonpartisan
ballot
at
the
primary
from
signing
an
independent
candidate’s
nomination
papers.
it’s
difficult
to
discern
any
particularly
legitimate
state
interest
or
compelling
state
interest
in
that
regard.
but
when
you
get
to
those
who
voted
at
a
partisan
primary,
well
certainly,
that
is
when
we
have
the
legitimate
and
compelling
state
interests
that
are
being
serve
by
excluding
them
from
signing
independent
nomination
papers.
these
are
basically
the
related
to
the
maintenance
of
party
integrity
and
party
organization
which
has
been
recognized
as
compelling
state
interests.
the
validity
of
this
type
of
revision
has
been
upheld
in
two
cases,
both
of
which
had
been
affirmed
by
this
court
that
is
jackson
versus
ogilvie
from
illinois
and
the
socialist
workers
party
versus
rockefeller.
the
court
desires
some
examples
of
--
this
is
not
exactly
a
party
rating
statute,
it
is
somewhat
analogous
thereto.
for
example,
if
we
didn’t
have
this
restriction,
a
voter
could
--
will
belong
to
a
particular
political
party.
if
he
could
go
in
and
vote
against
the
party’s
best
candidate
in
the
primary
and
then
go
and
attempt
to
further
his
own
candidate
at
the
independent
nominations.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
i
know
of
know
reason
to
restrict
it,
your
honor.
i
mean
i
have
to
be
candid
on
that
point
and
i
wish
that
(voice
overlap)
but
firstly,
i
wish
the
district
court
had
made
that
distinction.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
i
would
be
happy
if
nothing
were
struck
down,
your
honor
but
[laughter
attempt]
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
oh!
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
there
are
registration
list
posted
right
outside
of
the
polls
and
also
the
registration
books
have
the
registration
or
whether
they
are
declining
–-
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
i
would,
i
would,
yes,
i
would
presume
so
and
actually,
i
talked
to
the
registrar
at
voters
at
los
angeles
county
and
this
is
not
in
the
record,
just
off
the
record,
we
were
talking
about
how
they
did
it
and
as
i
understand
it,
their
position
was
that
they
counted
people
who
voted
a
nonpartisan
ballot
at
the
primary.
in
other
words,
they
permitted
them
to
sign
independent
nomination
papers
and
it
is
a
matter
of
construction
i
believe
and
it
is
a
matter
of
law.
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
necessary
--
you
would
not
have
to
over
turn
the
lower
court’s
decision
because
it
is
a
pure
matter
of
law
and
it
is
sustainable
under
existing
california
law.
we
have
this
one
case
cited
in
our
briefs
by
shashteg
versus
cater
i
believe
was
the
name
of
the
case
where
the
court
explained
that
what
we
called
the
primary
is
essentially
a
series
or
a
group
of
primaries
all
at
the
same
time
held
by
the
same
election
officers
at
the
same
place.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
well,
your
honor,
i
made
the
argument.
it
was
rejected
and
we
already
have
a
construction
at
least
--
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
no,
we
have
it
and
we
also
have
an
older
construction
by
the
california
supreme
court
that
the
primary
is
essentially
a
number
of
primaries
held
at
the
same
time.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
i
think
basically.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
not
now
if
it
is
regard
–-
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
if
the
court
feels
it
necessary
to
uphold
the
constitutionality
of
the
independent
nomination
procedure,
i
would
go
for
the
construction
that
it
is
a
series
of
primaries
and
not
--
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
well,
i
--
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
california
courts,
though
not
in
this
context,
has
sufficiently
construed
it
so
that
this
court
could
follow
the
california
law.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
well,
that’s
how
they
construed
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
no,
your
honor.
but
this
is
a
normal
situation
we
find
ourselves
in.
we
always
find
ourselves
for
a
good
portion
the
time
in
the
federal
district
courts
and
the
courts
may
at
this
juncture
be
more
prone
to
abstention
but
in
the
past,
it
is
seems
to
me
they
haven’t
been.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
[laughter
attempt]
well,
that’s
right
your
honor.
i
mean
if
they
have
to
get
a
decision
awfully
fast.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
pardon?
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
we
also
have
nominations
for
nonpartisan
officers
and
if
a
nonpartisan
--
a
number
of
people
will
file
nomination
papers,
for
example
for
county
supervisor
or
district
attorney
or
other
county
offices,
and
if
they
receive
a
majority
of
the
votes
cast
at
the
primary,
they
will
be
elected
that
the
primary
is
then
transmuted
into
the
general
election
and
they
are
declared
elected.
however
--
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
but
because
if
they
do
--
if
nobody
receives
a
majority
of
the
votes
cast,
then
there
will
be
a
run
off
election
at
the
general
election.
so,
it
is
not
also
a
nominating
election
for
–-
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
not
that
i
--
did
not
have
but
we
would
normally
consider
the
primary
election
because
at
least
you
say
in
general
law
counties
if
the
county
–-
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
no.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
no,
not
much
difference
your
honor.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
yes
sir.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
oh,
well
my
basic
position
is
that
we
should
examine
california
law
in
its
totality
as
was
done
in
williams
versus
rhodes
and
jenness
versus
fortson
and
that
–-
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
as
i
read
it,
it
was
because
as
i
recalled
it
--
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
my
recollection
was
that
the
court
examined
all
the
totality
of
the
georgia
election
laws
and
then
showed
that
all
these
various
alternatives
routes
to
the
ballot.
the
same
and
as
we
say
in
california,
we
have
all
these
various
alternative
routes
to
the
ballot
also.
so
that
we
just
don’t
isolate
one
and
say,
well,
that
one
is
unconstitutional.
what
we
do
is
we
look
at
california’s
law
in
its
totality
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
law
totally
as
a
package
satisfies
an
individual’s
constitutional
rights
to
run
for
office
and
voter’s
rights
to
vote
for
it.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
because
if
any
of
these
particular
provisions
should
be
considered
onerous.
we
feel
that
we
should
be
able
to
isolate
the
unconstitutional
from
the
constitutional
and
sever
whatever
provision
the
court
might
feel
is
unconstitutional
as
of
the
california
legislature
would
want
under
the
severability
clause
of
our
elections
code.
for
example,
the
court
has
clearly
approved
5%
requirements
or
less
but
may
be
the
court
might
feel
that
the
time
requirement
was
a
little
too
stringent
or
they
might
not
agree
with
another
provision
with
regard
to
who
may
or
may
not
sign
the
petitions.
but
what
i’m
doing
is
showing
that
even
assuming
we
have
to
look
at
the
independent
nominee
procedure
in
the
vacuum
that
it's
provisions
further
compelling
state
interests.
but
as
to
section
6830
(c)
and
(d)
as
they
apply
to
the
candidates
themselves
and
that’s
the
one
where
a
candidate
cannot
run
for
--
as
an
independent
candidate
if
he
has
voted
or
if
he
has
been
affiliated
with
a
qualified
party
for
one
year,
the
basic
thrust
of
these
requirements
are
also
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
our
party
system.
now,
they
are
part
of
our
package
in
california
which
ensures
at
the
primary
stage
that
the
party
rating
does
not
occur.
there
is
a
similar
one
year
provision
as
to
candidates
changing
between
parties
in
section
6401
and
if
you
add
that
up,
it
turns
out
to
be
more
than
a
17-month
provision
for
them
to
switch
parties
and
run
in
another
party.
and
that
is
--
and
so
by
a
parity
of
reasoning,
we
are
not
arguing
that
these
provisions
are
to
prevent
party
rating,
but
they
are
analogous
there
too.
we
feel
that
these
party
rating
statutes
are,
for
example,
in
lippitt
versus
cipollone,
there
was
a
four-year
restriction
as
to
a
candidate.
well,
that
is
basically
an
objective
test
and
what
we
are
saying
here
is
we
have
basically
a
one-year
objective
test
to
show
that
the
person
is
truly
an
independent
and
isn't
striking
off
on
his
own
as
a
disgruntled
member
of
a
party
to
splinter
the
party
at
the
general
election
stage,
or
you
could
have
the
whole
series
of
people
striking
out
on
their
own
and
the
party
system
would
just
disintegrated
if
that
were
permitted
and
the
cases
such
as
those
who
relied
upon
by
the
appellants
are
not
point
because
they
--
such
as
yale
versus
curve
and
they
were
cases
involving
restrictions
as
to
voters.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
that
that
would
be
how
the
analogy
would
be,
yes
your
honor.
but
then,
there
would
be
as
i
said
the
possibility
of
the
large
segment
of
a
party
being
disappointed
with
the
nominee
and
say,
okay,
well,
let’s
get
candidate
“x”
and
we
will
run
him
as
an
independent
and
we
will
show
them.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
no,
it
isn’t
[laughter
attempt]
unfortunately.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
well,
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
that
is
the
cases
i’ve
pointed
out
the
idea
is
that
if
they
could
do
that,
they
virtually
have
to
two
choices
for
office.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
yes,
your
honor,
that
isn’t
very
analogous.
now
with
regard
to
the
24-day
requirement,
this
serves
the
compelling
state
interest
of
letting
the
people
know
who
the
party
candidates
are
beforehand.
it
insures
that
current
attitudes
as
the
voters
who
reflected
in
the
petition
and
it
permits
voters
to
know
ahead
of
time
what
the
party
platforms
are
because
the
party
platforms
in
california
are
not
put
together
until
sometime
in
august.
now
as
was
pointed
out,
an
independent
did
actually
run
in
1972
for
assembly
in
los
angeles
and
my
time
is
up.(laughter
attempt)
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
our
basic
position
is
completely
different
of
course
than
the
appellants.
the
appellants
have
very
studiously
avoided
this
court’s
decision
in
jenness
versus
fortson
and
it
is
our
position
that
we
look
to
jenness
versus
fortson
for
the
guidelines
as
to
how
california’s
law
and
its
constitutionality
should
be
decided.
it
is
clear
when
we
look
at
california’s
law
that
california
has
preserved
the
fluidity
of
political
life
and
has
not
frozen
the
status
quo.
that
was
the
key
to
jenness
versus
fortson.
as
alluded
to
by
appellants
very
rapidly
as
we
--
in
their
argument,
california
has
not
two
parties,
but
has
four
qualified
parties
presently.
besides
the
democratic
and
republicans,
we
have
the
american
independent
party
and
the
peace
and
freedom
party.
so
obviously,
we
are
not
a
williams
versus
rhodes
situation
where
the
political
life
of
california
has
been
a
frozen
for
the
democrats
and
republicans.
also,
there’s
been
little
said
about
section
6430
of
the
california
elections
code.
we
feel
that
section
6430
of
elections
code
in
and
of
itself
without
even
reference
to
the
independent
nomination
procedure
satisfies
all
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
appellants
and
other
electors
in
california.
under
said
provisions
as
has
been
explained
an
old
party
can
remain
on
the
ballot
if
it
gets
2%
of
the
previous
vote.
secondly,
if
they
have
1%
registration
as
of
135
days
before
the
election,
they
also
become
a
qualified
party.
additionally,
they
can
become
a
qualified
party
by
getting
a
petition
with
10%
of
the
number
of
voters
at
the
last
gubernatorial
election.
we
also
have
the
ride-in
process
in
all
elections:
primary,
general,
state
and
local
offices,
federal
office
and
the
presidential
elections.
so,
we
haven’t
even
gotten
into
the
independent
nomination
procedure
so
obviously,
if
any
group
of
electors
wishes
to
organize
and
exercise
their
first
amendment
rights
under
the
provisions
of
section
6430
of
the
elections
code,
they
may
do
so
as
did
the
american
independent
party
and
the
peace
and
freedom
party
in
1948.
also
in
the
past,
we
have
had
other
qualified
parties
as
alluded
to
in
our
brief.
we
have
had
the
--
in
the
50’s
we
had
--
and
into
the
60’s,
the
progressive,
excuse
me,
the
prohibition
party
was
a
qualified
party
and
also
for
a
while
we
had
the,
i
believe
was
the
progressive
independent
party
in
the
50’s.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
1%
of
the
registration.
now
the
1/15
is
an
additional
qualification
to
stay
on
the
ballot.
there
is
a
provision
in
section
6430
that
says
“and
if
at
any
time
that
the
registration
falls
within
1/15
of
1%,
then
they
are
automatically
off
no
matter
what
they
got
the
last
time.”
now,
that’s
interesting
from
the
point
of
view
that
in
georgia
--
in
looking
at
georgia’s
5%
of
the
vote,
last
vote
requirement,
they
could
have
had
zero
because
they
do
not
have
that
added
qualification
and
the
court
still
upheld
georgia’s
5%
requirement
in
jenness
versus
fortson.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
oh,
well
in
other
words
–-
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
well,
a
party
can
stay
--
that
is
right,
it
is
--
no,
they
could
have
zero.
it
would
be
more
restrictive
in
that
even
if
they
have
zero
registration,
even
if
the
had
20%,
excuse
me,
not
the
5%,
the
20%
of
the
vote
requirement
for
an
old
party
of
the
stay
on.
their
registration
could
go
down
to
zero
and
they
would
still
have
been
a
qualified
party.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
so
basically
what
i’m
saying
is
that
without
reference
to
the
independent
nomination
procedure
itself,
the
fluidity
of
political
life
is
taking
care
of
in
california.
now,
insofar
as
the
–-
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
thank
you,
your
honor.
as
i
was
saying
before
lunch,
i
was
outlining
how
under
the
provisions
of
section
6430
of
the
california
elections
code,
the
fluidity
of
political
life
is
preserved
without
even
reference
to
the
independent
nomination
procedure
which
is
solely
attack
in
this
particular
lawsuit.
additionally
of
course,
we
have
the
ride-in
process
in
all
elections.
so
therefore,
we
get
to
the
question
what
scope
of
review
should
be
used
here
and
it
is
our
position
that
in
view
of
the
fact
that
section
6430
takes
in
addition
and
in
conjunction
with
the
ride-in
process
already
preserves
the
constitutional
rights
of
electors
in
california.
that
the
independent
nomination
procedure
really
essentially
has
its
existence
or
now
has
very
little
impact
upon
the
voters
in
california.
therefore,
under
the
test
set
forth
by
this
court
in
bullock
versus
carter,
the
rational
basis
test
should
be
used
in
examining
its
provisions
instead
of
the
close
scrutiny
test
and
in
this
regard
it
would
seem
that
we
are
essentially
talking
about
a
case
which
involves
barriers
to
candidacy
as
opposed
to
the
right
to
vote
per
se
as
found
in
such
cases
is
carrington
versus
rash
and
the
kramer
case,
the
cipriano
case
and
so
forth
which
were
direct
infringements
upon
and
that
direct
disenfranchisements.
however,
despite
the
fact
that
we
feel
that
only
the
rational
basis
test
need
be
used,
we
feel
that
even
should
we
examine
the
california
independent
nomination
procedure
in
a
vacuum
so
to
speak
that
each
of
its
substantive
provisions
are
necessary
to
further
compelling
state
interests
of
the
state.
now
taking
these
elements
individually,
we
first
of
all
have
the
5%
signature
requirement
of
section
6831.
well,
of
course,
this
court
has
recognized
unqualifiedly
that
in
jenness
versus
fortson
that
a
significant
modicum
of
support
is
proper
to
prevent
proliferation
of
the
ballot
and
to
also
prevent
confusion,
deception
and
even
frustration
of
our
electoral
system.
three-judge
district
courts
have
elevated
this
in
itself
to
a
compelling
state
interest.
for
example,
beniger
versus
ogilvie
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
and
the
beller
versus
kirk
which
was
affirmed
sub
nom
beller
versus
askew
by
this
court.
in
fact,
when
you
examine
california’s
5%
requirement
vis-à-vis
georgia’s
5%
requirements,
you
will
find
that
california’s
5%
requirement
is
really
about
a
3-1/2%
requirement,
because
georgia
uses
a
different
test.
georgia
used
a
test
of
all
of
the
electors
who
were
qualified
to
vote
at
the
last
election
whereas
california
uses
the
test
all
those
people
who
actually
voted
for
that
office
then
using
the
70%
test
that
the
appellant’s
use
all
the
time,
that
would
come
out
to
about
a
3-1/2%
requirement
on
georgia’s
scale
instead
of
a
5%
requirement.
additionally,
we
point
out
that
appellants
apparently
do
not
seriously
even
contest
the
5%
requirement
in
and
of
itself
and
we
presume
the
difficult
for
them
to
do
because
of
jenness
versus
fortson
and
cases
as
such
as
--
excuse
me,
not
beniger
versus
ogilvie,
it
was
jackson
versus
ogilvie
and
beller
versus
kirk.
now,
moving
on
to
the
6830
(c)
of
the
california
elections
code
wherein
it
restricts
the
signatories
to
those
who
have
not
voted
at
the
primary
election.
now,
there
was
much
of
discussion
as
to
what
is
a
primary
election
in
california.
now
our
position
below
at
the
district
court
level
was
that
in
california,
the
primary
election
held
in
june
is
in
reality,
a
series
of
primary
elections.
it’s
essentially
a
consolidation
of
a
group
of
primary
elections,
one
for
each
parties.
therefore
in
1972,
we
would
have
had
a
primary
election
for
four
parties
and
a
separate
primary
election,
basically
for
“declines
to
state.”
now,
we
have
cited
a
case,
a
california
case
–-
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
oh!
no.
it’s
all
at
the
same
time
and
–-
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
yes
sir.
but
there
are
separate
ballots
for
each
party
and
each
party
essentially
holds
its
primary
election,
then
the
“declines
to
state”
also
nominates
nonpartisan
officers
such
as
county
supervisors
and
then
as
was
explained
there
are
usually
a
proliferation
of
ballot
propositions
that
we
all
struggle
with
at
least
twice
a
year.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
that
was
our
position
below
your
honor
that
i
feel
that
–-
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
if
required
to
sustain
the
constitutionality,
that
would
be
my
position,
yes
sir.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
i
understand
it
that
--
unfortunately,
the
district
court
considered
the
primary
as
single
election.
well,
it
is
difficult
to
argue
any
purpose
which
would
be
served
by
excluding
those
who
have
voted
a
nonpartisan
ballot
at
the
primary
from
signing
an
independent
candidate’s
nomination
papers.
it’s
difficult
to
discern
any
particularly
legitimate
state
interest
or
compelling
state
interest
in
that
regard.
but
when
you
get
to
those
who
voted
at
a
partisan
primary,
well
certainly,
that
is
when
we
have
the
legitimate
and
compelling
state
interests
that
are
being
serve
by
excluding
them
from
signing
independent
nomination
papers.
these
are
basically
the
related
to
the
maintenance
of
party
integrity
and
party
organization
which
has
been
recognized
as
compelling
state
interests.
the
validity
of
this
type
of
revision
has
been
upheld
in
two
cases,
both
of
which
had
been
affirmed
by
this
court
that
is
jackson
versus
ogilvie
from
illinois
and
the
socialist
workers
party
versus
rockefeller.
the
court
desires
some
examples
of
--
this
is
not
exactly
a
party
rating
statute,
it
is
somewhat
analogous
thereto.
for
example,
if
we
didn’t
have
this
restriction,
a
voter
could
--
will
belong
to
a
particular
political
party.
if
he
could
go
in
and
vote
against
the
party’s
best
candidate
in
the
primary
and
then
go
and
attempt
to
further
his
own
candidate
at
the
independent
nominations.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
that
is
correct
your
honor.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
i
know
of
know
reason
to
restrict
it,
your
honor.
i
mean
i
have
to
be
candid
on
that
point
and
i
wish
that
(voice
overlap)
but
firstly,
i
wish
the
district
court
had
made
that
distinction.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
i
would
be
happy
if
nothing
were
struck
down,
your
honor
but
[laughter
attempt]
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
oh!
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
there
are
registration
list
posted
right
outside
of
the
polls
and
also
the
registration
books
have
the
registration
or
whether
they
are
declining
–-
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
i
would,
i
would,
yes,
i
would
presume
so
and
actually,
i
talked
to
the
registrar
at
voters
at
los
angeles
county
and
this
is
not
in
the
record,
just
off
the
record,
we
were
talking
about
how
they
did
it
and
as
i
understand
it,
their
position
was
that
they
counted
people
who
voted
a
nonpartisan
ballot
at
the
primary.
in
other
words,
they
permitted
them
to
sign
independent
nomination
papers
and
it
is
a
matter
of
construction
i
believe
and
it
is
a
matter
of
law.
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
necessary
--
you
would
not
have
to
over
turn
the
lower
court’s
decision
because
it
is
a
pure
matter
of
law
and
it
is
sustainable
under
existing
california
law.
we
have
this
one
case
cited
in
our
briefs
by
shashteg
versus
cater
i
believe
was
the
name
of
the
case
where
the
court
explained
that
what
we
called
the
primary
is
essentially
a
series
or
a
group
of
primaries
all
at
the
same
time
held
by
the
same
election
officers
at
the
same
place.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
well,
your
honor,
i
made
the
argument.
it
was
rejected
and
we
already
have
a
construction
at
least
--
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
no,
we
have
it
and
we
also
have
an
older
construction
by
the
california
supreme
court
that
the
primary
is
essentially
a
number
of
primaries
held
at
the
same
time.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
i
think
basically.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
not
now
if
it
is
regard
–-
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way,
if
the
court
feels
it
necessary
to
uphold
the
constitutionality
of
the
independent
nomination
procedure,
i
would
go
for
the
construction
that
it
is
a
series
of
primaries
and
not
--
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
well,
i
--
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
california
courts,
though
not
in
this
context,
has
sufficiently
construed
it
so
that
this
court
could
follow
the
california
law.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
well,
that’s
how
they
construed
it,
yes
sir.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
no,
your
honor.
but
this
is
a
normal
situation
we
find
ourselves
in.
we
always
find
ourselves
for
a
good
portion
the
time
in
the
federal
district
courts
and
the
courts
may
at
this
juncture
be
more
prone
to
abstention
but
in
the
past,
it
is
seems
to
me
they
haven’t
been.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
[laughter
attempt]
well,
that’s
right
your
honor.
i
mean
if
they
have
to
get
a
decision
awfully
fast.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
pardon?
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
we
also
have
nominations
for
nonpartisan
officers
and
if
a
nonpartisan
--
a
number
of
people
will
file
nomination
papers,
for
example
for
county
supervisor
or
district
attorney
or
other
county
offices,
and
if
they
receive
a
majority
of
the
votes
cast
at
the
primary,
they
will
be
elected
that
the
primary
is
then
transmuted
into
the
general
election
and
they
are
declared
elected.
however
--
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
but
because
if
they
do
--
if
nobody
receives
a
majority
of
the
votes
cast,
then
there
will
be
a
run
off
election
at
the
general
election.
so,
it
is
not
also
a
nominating
election
for
–-
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
not
that
i
--
did
not
have
but
we
would
normally
consider
the
primary
election
because
at
least
you
say
in
general
law
counties
if
the
county
–-
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
no.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
no,
not
much
difference
your
honor.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
yes
sir.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
oh,
well
my
basic
position
is
that
we
should
examine
california
law
in
its
totality
as
was
done
in
williams
versus
rhodes
and
jenness
versus
fortson
and
that
–-
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
as
i
read
it,
it
was
because
as
i
recalled
it
--
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
my
recollection
was
that
the
court
examined
all
the
totality
of
the
georgia
election
laws
and
then
showed
that
all
these
various
alternatives
routes
to
the
ballot.
the
same
and
as
we
say
in
california,
we
have
all
these
various
alternative
routes
to
the
ballot
also.
so
that
we
just
don’t
isolate
one
and
say,
well,
that
one
is
unconstitutional.
what
we
do
is
we
look
at
california’s
law
in
its
totality
and
determine
whether
or
not
the
law
totally
as
a
package
satisfies
an
individual’s
constitutional
rights
to
run
for
office
and
voter’s
rights
to
vote
for
it.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
because
if
any
of
these
particular
provisions
should
be
considered
onerous.
we
feel
that
we
should
be
able
to
isolate
the
unconstitutional
from
the
constitutional
and
sever
whatever
provision
the
court
might
feel
is
unconstitutional
as
of
the
california
legislature
would
want
under
the
severability
clause
of
our
elections
code.
for
example,
the
court
has
clearly
approved
5%
requirements
or
less
but
may
be
the
court
might
feel
that
the
time
requirement
was
a
little
too
stringent
or
they
might
not
agree
with
another
provision
with
regard
to
who
may
or
may
not
sign
the
petitions.
but
what
i’m
doing
is
showing
that
even
assuming
we
have
to
look
at
the
independent
nominee
procedure
in
the
vacuum
that
it's
provisions
further
compelling
state
interests.
but
as
to
section
6830
(c)
and
(d)
as
they
apply
to
the
candidates
themselves
and
that’s
the
one
where
a
candidate
cannot
run
for
--
as
an
independent
candidate
if
he
has
voted
or
if
he
has
been
affiliated
with
a
qualified
party
for
one
year,
the
basic
thrust
of
these
requirements
are
also
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
our
party
system.
now,
they
are
part
of
our
package
in
california
which
ensures
at
the
primary
stage
that
the
party
rating
does
not
occur.
there
is
a
similar
one
year
provision
as
to
candidates
changing
between
parties
in
section
6401
and
if
you
add
that
up,
it
turns
out
to
be
more
than
a
17-month
provision
for
them
to
switch
parties
and
run
in
another
party.
and
that
is
--
and
so
by
a
parity
of
reasoning,
we
are
not
arguing
that
these
provisions
are
to
prevent
party
rating,
but
they
are
analogous
there
too.
we
feel
that
these
party
rating
statutes
are,
for
example,
in
lippitt
versus
cipollone,
there
was
a
four-year
restriction
as
to
a
candidate.
well,
that
is
basically
an
objective
test
and
what
we
are
saying
here
is
we
have
basically
a
one-year
objective
test
to
show
that
the
person
is
truly
an
independent
and
isn't
striking
off
on
his
own
as
a
disgruntled
member
of
a
party
to
splinter
the
party
at
the
general
election
stage,
or
you
could
have
the
whole
series
of
people
striking
out
on
their
own
and
the
party
system
would
just
disintegrated
if
that
were
permitted
and
the
cases
such
as
those
who
relied
upon
by
the
appellants
are
not
point
because
they
--
such
as
yale
versus
curve
and
they
were
cases
involving
restrictions
as
to
voters.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
that
that
would
be
how
the
analogy
would
be,
yes
your
honor.
but
then,
there
would
be
as
i
said
the
possibility
of
the
large
segment
of
a
party
being
disappointed
with
the
nominee
and
say,
okay,
well,
let’s
get
candidate
“x”
and
we
will
run
him
as
an
independent
and
we
will
show
them.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
no,
it
isn’t
[laughter
attempt]
unfortunately.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
well,
that
is
correct
your
honor
and
that
is
the
cases
i’ve
pointed
out
the
idea
is
that
if
they
could
do
that,
they
virtually
have
to
two
choices
for
office.
mr.
clayton
p.
roche
yes,
your
honor,
that
isn’t
very
analogous.
now
with
regard
to
the
24-day
requirement,
this
serves
the
compelling
state
interest
of
letting
the
people
know
who
the
party
candidates
are
beforehand.
it
insures
that
current
attitudes
as
the
voters
who
reflected
in
the
petition
and
it
permits
voters
to
know
ahead
of
time
what
the
party
platforms
are
because
the
party
platforms
in
california
are
not
put
together
until
sometime
in
august.
now
as
was
pointed
out,
an
independent
did
actually
run
in
1972
for
assembly
in
los
angeles
and
my
time
is
up.(laughter
attempt)
