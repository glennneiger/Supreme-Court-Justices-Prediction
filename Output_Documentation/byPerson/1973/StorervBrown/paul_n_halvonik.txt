mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
my
name
is
paul
halvonik.
i’m
one
of
the
attorneys
for
the
appellants
here.
the
other
attorney
for
appellants
is
to
my
left
here
mr.
remcho.
i
will
consume
20
of
the
allotted
30
minutes.
mr.
remcho
10.
i
would
like
to
speak
first
for
15
minutes
and
then
reserve
5
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
the
appellants
in
these
cases
are
candidates
for
public
office
and
their
supporters.
all
of
the
candidates
are
unaffiliated
with
political
parties
recognized
by
the
state
of
california.
that
is
to
say
none
belongs
to
any
political
party
that
has
a
place
in
the
california
ballot.
they
brought
suit
to
obtain
ballots
based
last
general
election.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
right.
there’s
no
line
for
them
in
the
california
ballot.
two
of
the
appellants
are
members
of
the
communist
party,
but
the
communist
party
is
not
a
recognized
party
in
california.
the
other
two
appellants,
storer
and
frommhagen
belong
to
no
political
party
at
all
in
any
sense
of
the
word.
in
california,
people
who
are
not
members
of
the
political
parties
are
deemed
“declines
to
state”
and
are
independents
in
that
sense.
and
so,
we
have
two
sets
of
independents,
genuine
independents
and
people
who
are
independents
because
their
political
party
isn't
recognized
in
the
state.
they
brought
suit
to
obtain
space
on
the
ballot
as
independents
and
challenge
the
restrictive
scheme
of
the
california
election
law
for
regulating
independent
access.
the
scheme
in
brief
is
this.
they
have
to
obtain
5%
of
the
registered
voters,
the
signatures
of
registered
voters
in
a
24-day
period.
that
period
begins
long
after
the
primary
elections
on
august
15
and
ended
on
september
8.
no
one
could
sign
one
of
those
petitions
who
voted
in
the
primary.
even
though
nonpartisans
vote
in
california
primary
elections,
they
are
given
a
nonpartisan
ballot.
it
doesn’t
have
such
offices
as
congress
and
senator
on
it,
but
has
ballot
propositions
in
local
offices,
county
and
city
which
are
nonpartisan
offices
in
california.
you
can’t
have
a
party
designation
for
those
offices.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
no
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
at
the
primary
election,
you
have
a
democratic
primary
or
republican
primary,
and
two
other
primaries.
additionally,
there
are
ballot
propositions.
the
number
used
to
be
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
20
these
years,
about
20
ballot
propositions
dealing
with
all
kinds
of
legislation.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
to
decide
legislation
--
we
decide
legislation
in
california
by
ballot,
voted
by
the
people.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
do
it
in
both.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes.
they
appear
on
both
ballots.
they
are
different
time
periods
and
sometimes
you
make
a
june
ballot
and
sometime
november
ballot.
and
the
june
ballot
comes
out
at
the
primary
election,
but
a
nonpartisan,
a
person
who
is
not
registered
with
any
political
party
goes
down
to
the
place
where
he
casts
his
ballot
and
is
given
what
is
called
a
nonpartisan
ballot
and
on
that
will
appear
all
the
ballot
propositions.
partisan
offices,
what
they
called
partisan
offices
in
california,
do
not
appear
on
that
ballot.
that
is
he
doesn’t
vote
for
anybody
for
congress
or
senate
or
president.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
but
he
votes
if
the
election
is
coterminous
for
such
offices
as
city
councilmen
and
supervisor
on
that
date.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
which
are
nonpartisan
and
so
you
have
a
person
who
go
to
the
primary
election
and
cast
ballot
and
yet
in
the
california
election
scheme,
although
they
haven’t
participated
in
the
partisan
primary,
they
are
not
permitted
to
sign
nominating
petitions
for
independents.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it's
not
by
most
persons’
terms
a
primary
election
so
called
in
california.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
no,
no.
california
is
a
bit
different.
there
was
a
--
in
the
early
part
of
the
century,
there
was
a
great
rebellion
against
the
party
system
and
california
setup
a
cross-filing
system
so
that
people
who
belong
one
party
can
run
in
the
other.
it
removed
any
party
designation
from
the
ballots
of
local
elections.
it
setup
the
initiative
from
referendum
so
these
ballot
propositions
appeared
at
that
time.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
but
they
kept
calling
it
a
primary
election.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes,
ride-in
candidate.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes,
this
–-
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
nonpartisan
ballots,
but
storer,
one
of
the
appellants
here
can
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
the
code
section
so
reads
then
that’s
what
the
lower
court
held.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
right.
that’s
it
exactly
although,
he
made
his
declaration
before
election
day,
you
have
to
be
registered
before
then.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well
anyway,
now,
those
people
excluded
from
signing
a
petition
and
the
appellant
storer
is
also
since
he
cast
a
nonpartisan
ballot
excluded
by
virtue
of
that
from
running
for
offices
as
an
independent,
and
further
he
is
not
permitted
to
run
as
an
independent
because
some
ten
months
before
the
general
election
he
was
registered
as
a
democrat
and
california
requires
you
if
you
been
a
member
of
a
political
party
to
wait
17
months
before
an
election,
before
you
can
be
an
independent.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
it’s
the
period
12
months
before
the
primary
election
and
then
you
add
the
five
months
then
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
right.
and
it
comes
out
about
17
months.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
before
you
can
run
as
an
independent
candidate
–-
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
--
you
have
to
purge
yourself
of
any
party
affiliations
some
17
months
before
the
general
election.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
right.
as
storer
here
asked
--
sought
and
there
is
an
affidavit
in
there,
he
sought
to
get
his
nominating
papers
out
and
he
told
them
he
could
not
have
them
because
he
been
registered
as
democrat
within
the
preceding
17
months.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
now,
this
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it’s
the
entire
vote
in
the
area.
so,
if
you
are
running
for
congress,
it
is
5%
in
your
congressional
district,
5%
of
the
people
who
voted
at
the
last
general
election.
if
you’re
running
statewide,
it
is
5%
of
the
entire
vote
in
the
state.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
it’s
our
estimate
and
it
was
the
estimate
of
the
secretary
of
the
state
at
the
time
the
election
was
being
held
that
about
70%
of
the
people
would
vote
for
primary.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
although
of
course
you
can
get
additional
registrations.
you
can
go
out
with
the
registration
book
and
get
additional
people
to
register.
if
you
are
in
the
district
with
very
low
registration,
that’s
one
way
where
you
can
conceivably
meet
these
requirements
and
in
fact
after
we
brought
these
suits,
somebody
did.
a
man
named
raul
ruiz
in
the
48th
assembly
district
of
california
which
is
the
smallest
assembly
district
where
all
he
needed
was
1,800
signatures.
a
large
chicano
population,
an
average
in
assembly
district
which
is
half
the
congressional
district
about
is
4,500
signatures
you
need.
he
needed
about
1,800,
very
low
registration
went
into
chicano
communities
and
promoted
himself
as
a
la
raza
candidate
and
was
able
to
make
the
ballot.
the
only
one
as
far
as
we
know
whose
ever
made
it
under
the
current
california
independent
provisions.
the
system
is
justified
by
the
state
of
the
california
on
the
grounds
that
makes
for
manageable
ballot
in
size
and
that
justification
we
contend
is
transparently
untenable
because
the
state
also
points
out
probably
a
few
times,
you
can
have
100
political
parties
in
california.
they
are
four
at
the
moment.
actually,
mathematically,
it
is
possible
to
have
more
than
100.
and
so,
the
interest
in
the
manageable
ballot
only
occurs
when
you
do
not
want
to
be
affiliated
with
a
political
party.
the
old
party
stay
on
if
they
have
1/15
of
1%
or
the
registry
vote,
and
if
they
collected
only
2%
of
the
vote
in
the
last
election.
a
new
party
needs
to
collect
just
1%
of
the
electorate
as
registered
voters
in
its
party
and
it
gets
a
place
in
the
ballot.
so
the
manageable
ballot
excuse
would
not
go
and
the
state
then
justifies
the
provision
on
the
grounds
that
may
legitimately
promote
political
parties
as
distinguished
from
independents,
and
even
keep
independence
off
of
the
ballot
if
it
wishes,
and
that
is
where
we
take
issue
with
the
state.
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
as
we
understated
any
way
is
supposed
to
promote
a
free
marketplace
of
ideas
and
a
statutory
system,
validly
designed
to
restrain
trading
ideas
does
not
seem
to
last
--
to
comport
with
the
first
amendment
but
to
affirm
it.
we
are
dealing
here
with
fundamental
right,
the
right
to
vote
and
the
ballot,
well
we
are
thinking
of
the
right
to
vote
on
first
amendment
terms
is
this
court
referred
to
it
williams
versus
rhodes
is
sort
of
a
form
and
while
the
state,
when
it
opens
the
form,
in
this
case
the
ballot
being
form
of
its
opening,
even
though
it
need
no
open
the
form,
once
it
opens
the
form,
it
has
to
use
neutral
principles
to
decide
who
gets
access
to
that
form.
it
can
decide
on
the
basis
of
preferred
political
content
or
preferred
political
associations
who
gets
on
the
ballot,
but
that
is
what
california
does
and
that
is
what
californian
claims
is
to
–-
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
it’s
an
equal
protection
principle.
it
is
related
to
the
first
amendment
principle.
under
the
equal
protection
ideas
when
one
opens
up
a
part
for
instance,
city
maybe
does
not
have
to
build
the
part
but
once
it
does,
it
is
going
to
issue
permits
for
speakers
in
the
part.
it
has
to
issue
them
in
a
neutral
manner,
that's
sort
of
a
combination
of
equal
protection
in
first
amendment
values
i
should
think.
but
we
are
relying
on
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
that
is
the
basic
claim
for
this
that
the
state
once
it
provides
ballots
base
has
to
do
it
in
an
even
head
in
the
matter
and
this
is
connected
and
interrelated
with
the
first
amendment
question
of
political
neutrality
in
deciding
what
standards
are
used
to
get
on
the
ballot.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
we're
claiming
that
the
state
discriminates
you
against
people
who
seek
ballot
positions
because
they
do
not
have
particular
kinds
of
associations.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
he
has
to
forgo
getting
on
the
ballot
and
yes,
he
can
forgo
all
he
wants
to
and
the
state
merely
penalizes
him
by
removing
him
from
the
actual
process,
and
the
removing
[laughter
attempt]
and
their
supporters
are
removed
from
the
electoral
process
effectively
and
force
to
have
on
their
ballots
only
those
candidates
which
they
do
not
wish
to
support.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
i
think
the
first
is
helpful
this
way
mr.
justice
blackmun
deciding
what
standard
is
then
used
to
determine
who
is
being
irrationally
discriminated
against,
and
we
maintain
the
first
amendment
sort
of
standard
applies
here
is
the
close
scrutiny
standard
and
that
what
we’re
involved
in
is
the
exercise
of
the
fundamental
right,
cognate
to
first
amendment
right
as
illuminated
in
this
court’s
opinion
in
williams
versus
rhodes.
the
discriminatory
system
against
those
unaffiliated
political
parties
is
reflected
not
just
in
the
ballot
direct
access
question,
but
on
in
the
statute
which
prohibited
storer
from
being
on
the
ballot.
we
have
already
discussed
his
casting
of
a
partisan
--
a
nonpartisan
primary
ballot
excluding
him
from
the
party.
and
i
mentioned
also
that
he
was
excluded
because
he
had
been
a
member
of
a
political
party
within
the
preceding
17
months.
and
we
contend
that
there
is
no
justification
for
the
provision.
it's
one
thing
that
requires
somebody
to
be
a
member
of
a
party
first
for
certain
amount
of
time
before
he
may
run
as
that
party’s
candidate
to
establish
his
adherence
to
whatever
general
principles
that
party
may
have,
but
an
independent
by
definition
is
saying
he
is
not
associated
with
any
group
of
political
ideas,
associated
with
any
particular
political
party.
the
state
of
california
says
well
when
he
goes,
he
is
splintering
the
party,
but
splinters
is
just
pejorative
for
independent,
and
i
would
think
political
parties
who
cannot
withstand
people
this
effect
at
leaving
that
party
and
cannot
stand
the
competition
at
the
ballot,
when
these
people
meet
least
of
the
qualifications
to
get
on
the
ballot
is
political
party
perhaps
does
not
have
where
does
the
people
who
want
to
buy
and
i
do
not
see
where
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
insulating
that
political
party
from
what
it
would
term
splinters,
i
do
not
know
who
decides
what
to
splinter
–-
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
mr.
remcho
argued
it
at
that
time
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes,
for
mr.
storer
and
mr.
roche
appeared
for
the
state
at
that
time.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
we’d
hope
it
was
that
way.
i
do
not
know
that
whether
our
opening
was
well
settled.
we
feel
that
if
followed
fairly
much
from
williams
versus
rhodes
that
they
were
entitled
to
a
ballot
decision,
and
we
thought
and
furthered
it,
the
state
could
not
make
the
manageable
ballot
argument
because
if
you
pointed
out
that
interest
only
arises
when
you
are
affiliated
with
the
parties,
the
four-party
state
and
we
felt
further
that
the
state
can’t
maintain
that
it
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
promoting
political
parties,
people
affiliated
within
and
the
exclusions
of
those
who
have
no
political
party
affiliations.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
there
are
two
things
going
on
here
though.
the
independent
can’t
start
circulating
his
petition
until
late
august
while
the
primary
occurred
in
june.
so
that
in
order
to
get
5%
of
the
electorate
to
hang
around,
you’ve
got
to
convince
them
not
to
get
involved
back
in
that
process
at
all
if
california
had
a
system
which
gave
the
independents
an
equal
crack
at
the
same
time.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
i
don’t
think
it’s
unconstitutional
as
to
such
system
indeed
georgia
has
that
system,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
unconstitutional
to
acquire
them
to
make
a
choice.
i
think
it
is
unconstitutional
to
give
the
parties
the
advantage.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it
is
violation
because
they
won’t
let
the
independent
compete
at
the
time
of
the
primary.
if
they’re
not
going
to
let
the
independent
compete
at
that
time
for
that
vote,
and
they
can’t
say
well
he’s
getting
two
bites
at
the
apple.
now,
if
they
want
to
let
him
--
the
independent
compete
at
the
same
time.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
all
very
well
if
independents
were
in
fact
like
a
political
party,
but
they’re
not.
they
are
different
kinds
of
people
who
are
independents.
mr.
frommhagen
does
not
get
along
with
mr.
hall
at
all,
and
he
is
not
going
to
get
together
with
him
at
any
convention.
the
idea
of
independence
is
that
they
are
not
organized.
if
somebody
wants
to
be
an
independent
candidate,
the
supporters
have
an
equal
opportunity
to
canvas
and
solicit
people
to
sign
nominating
petitions.
at
the
time
when
these
other
people
have
the
opportunity
to
have
them
go
to
the
polls
in
the
primaries,
then
i
would
say
you
can
make
a
distinction
so
you
got
to
make
your
choice.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
now,
what
happens
to
the
california
is
the
man
can’t
even
circulate
the
petitions
until
two
months
after
the
primary.
so,
he
is
completely
taken
out
of
that
arena
at
the
time
when
the
voters
are
most
thinking
about
the
issues.
that
the
parties
are
getting
this
tremendous
advantage
and
it
is
argued
that
that
gives
people
or
make
sure
that
they
reflect
current
attitudes.
well,
the
parties
do
not
reflect
any
current
attitudes.
it
is
been
two
years
since
the
election
in
which
they
relying
on
to
stay
on
the
ballot
and
yet,
an
independent
can’t
appear
in
january
or
february
and
start
soliciting
signatures
for
his
candidacy.
by
then,
an
independent
fairly
well
knows
what
the
main
issues
you
are
going
to
be
in
the
following
year,
and
that
independent
does
not
care
with
the
candidates
are.
maybe
that
independent
like
tom
storer
just
doesn’t
feel
the
political
parties
at
the
moment
are
properly
representing
the
people
if
they
are
too
much
grounded
by
interests
who
he
thinks
are
inimical
to
the
benefit
of
the
people
of
marion
county.
he
doesn’t
want
to
form
a
political
party,
he
doesn’t
care
what
happens
in
orange
county,
or
he
doesn’t
care
anymore
than
he
cares
with
that
in
klamoth
county
up
in
oregon.
he
is
interested
in
marion
county,
that
is
where
he
wants
to
run.
we
have
a
congressman
in
the
district
below
him,
a
mcclaskey
who
would
like
to
run
as
an
independent,
his
a
member
of
congress,
who
could
win
as
independent,
most
political
experts
think
but
may
be
you
cannot
get
through
a
republican
primary.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
he
doesn’t
want
any
backing
of
an
organized
political
party.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
pardon?
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes,
he
wants
to
get
elected.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
without
a
political
party’s
backing.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
it
won’t
be
a
party
under
the
terms
that
he
conceives
of
a
party.
if
he
gets
group
of
people
behind
him
to
support
him
who
are
not
connected
with
the
ongoing
institutional
group
tied
to
particular
interests.
he
feels
he
can
win.
he
does
not
want
to
be
tied
to
those
interests,
he
rather
loose,
but
it
is
not
a
just
a
candidacy,
he
is
a
genuine
candidate
as
mcclaskey
would
be
running
as
an
independent
and
mcclaskey
would
probably
win.
for
sure,
it
is
very
likely
he’d
win
in
his
district
because
it's
a
democratic
district
in
which
he
has
won
as
a
republican
constantly.
i
wonder
if
i
could
just
briskly
on
the
couple
of
other
points.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
whether
lippitt
was
not
inconsistent
with
our
position
that
with
requiring,
you
not
to
have
been
a
member
of
a
party
for
a
year
an
a
half
violated
article
1,
section
2.
issue
was
never
raised
in
lippitt.
there
is
another
distinction
in
lippitt
in
that
we
were
talking
here
about
a
party
primary,
so
we
don’t
know
in
lippitt
from
what
at
least
occurs
in
the
lower
court
opinion
whether
that
person
was
absolutely
foreclosed
from
appearing
on
the
general
election
ballot
or
just
foreclosed
from
appearing
as
a
democratic
nominee.
but
here,
we
have
somebody
absolutely
foreclosed
because
it
belongs
to
a
class
from
which
he
can’t
escape.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
what
i
am
saying
in
lippitt,
the
issue
was
raised
essentially
as
an
equal
protection
one
and
you
can
go
into
all
kinds
of
balances
at
that
point,
but
article
1,
section
2
does
not
allow
for
balance.
if
it
is
a
qualification,
then
the
states
can't
add
it
and
that
issue
was
not
raised
in
lippitt
and
cases
do
not
stand
for
propositions
that
weren’t
raised.
i
think
that
goes
for
lippitt.
it
goes
for
minor
versus
happersett
which
is
sort
of
the
dred
scott
of
women’s
liberation
[laughter
attempt].
that
that
did
not
involve
the
equal
protection
clause
which
is
the
principal
clause
we
were
relying
on.
it
is
privileges
and
immunities
case
and
so
at
that
case
seems
to
be
the
only
one
that
suggest
that
voting
is
not
a
constitution
right
protected
at
least
in
congressional
elections.
that
case
does
not
go
to
the
principal
issue.
on
that
point,
mr.
justice
marshall
raised
a
question
about
whether
a
classic
involve
the
right
of
a
candidate
to
run
for
office.
it
is
on
page
308
--
313
u.s.
says
they
were
charged
with
interfering,
with
the
free
exercise
of
the
right
of
candidates
to
run
for
the
office
of
congressman,
and
they
have
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
right.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
no,
it
was
group
of
--
it
was
section
19
and
20
case
that
was
a
criminal
prosecution
for
people
for
interfering
with
the
right
of
those
candidates
to
run
for
office.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
i’d
say
your
honor
at
page
308,
this
is
the
right
of
the
candidates
to
run
for
office.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
oh,
let
me
move
to
abstention
just
for
a
moment.
it
was
not
raised
below.
there
responses
filed
on
august
18,
not
three
months
--
not
three
weeks
before
the
election.
in
august,
they
filed
a
response
to
not
raise
the
abstention
issue.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
no,
no,
it
was
august
18,
1972.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it
was
filed
before
the
primary
election.
the
answer
was
filed
on
august.
we
have
the
preliminary
--
hearing
and
preliminary
injunction
on
august
31.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
“declines
to
state,”
no
matter
how
much
you
want
to
stay.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i
do
not
know
we’ve
really
handled
this
–-
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
when
i
brought
the
case,
i
had
to
assume
that
the
language
in
the
code
section
meant
what
it
said,
and
i
had
to
attack
that
section.
then
mr.
roche
came
in
and
found
that
he
could
not
come
up
with
any
justification
with
that
section
so
it
does
not
mean
that,
and
i
said
that
is
fine
with
me.
let
us
not
argue
about
that.
however,
the
district
court
ignored
the
concession,
so
here
we
are.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
interpret
it
anyway
other
--
if
you
interpret
the
way
the
district
court
interprets
it,
it
is
clearly
unconstitutional.
nobody
could
come
up
with
a
justification
for
it.
it
seems
to
me
if
the
state
tells
you
that
it
ought
to
be
interpreted
the
other
way
that
you
do
not
have
any
real
problem
of
–-
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
i
would
suppose
it
and
the
only
answer
is
that
if
as
i
contend
it,
it
is
clearly
facially
unconstitutional
is
to
hold
an
unconstitutional
and
if
the
state
court
wants
to
say
you
made
an
error
the
way
you
read
it,
they
can
do
that
and
revive
–-
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
one
difficulty
was
that
is
though
we
did
not
file
that
suit
three
weeks
before
the
election.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
we
get
another
election
coming
up
in
1974.
now,
if
we
go
back
and
you
abstain
them
we
got
to
go
for
the
superior
court
of
california
and
appeal
at
the
court
of
appeal.
effectively,
we’re
talking
about
a
couple
of
more
years
of
litigation,
and
we
are
talking
about
a
very
fundamental
right
here.
and
i
do
not
know
that
when
you
are
talking
in
the
selection
context
about
the
very
fundamental
rights
that
states
come
up
with
ambiguity.
i
do
not
agree
that
it’s
an
ambiguity,
but
the
state
wants
to
create
an
ambiguity
by
saying
it
is
not
we
meant.
i
don’t
think
they
can
by
that
ploy
force
us
to
pass
another
election
without
knowing
whether
we
can
run
on
the
grounds
somewhat
equivalent
with
the
parties.
you
know
some
sort
of
parity,
people
who
are
not
affiliated
with
the
political
party
so
that
they
are
invidiously
discriminated
against.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it
is
indeed.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice.
my
name
is
paul
halvonik.
i’m
one
of
the
attorneys
for
the
appellants
here.
the
other
attorney
for
appellants
is
to
my
left
here
mr.
remcho.
i
will
consume
20
of
the
allotted
30
minutes.
mr.
remcho
10.
i
would
like
to
speak
first
for
15
minutes
and
then
reserve
5
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
the
appellants
in
these
cases
are
candidates
for
public
office
and
their
supporters.
all
of
the
candidates
are
unaffiliated
with
political
parties
recognized
by
the
state
of
california.
that
is
to
say
none
belongs
to
any
political
party
that
has
a
place
in
the
california
ballot.
they
brought
suit
to
obtain
ballots
based
last
general
election.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
right.
there’s
no
line
for
them
in
the
california
ballot.
two
of
the
appellants
are
members
of
the
communist
party,
but
the
communist
party
is
not
a
recognized
party
in
california.
the
other
two
appellants,
storer
and
frommhagen
belong
to
no
political
party
at
all
in
any
sense
of
the
word.
in
california,
people
who
are
not
members
of
the
political
parties
are
deemed
“declines
to
state”
and
are
independents
in
that
sense.
and
so,
we
have
two
sets
of
independents,
genuine
independents
and
people
who
are
independents
because
their
political
party
isn't
recognized
in
the
state.
they
brought
suit
to
obtain
space
on
the
ballot
as
independents
and
challenge
the
restrictive
scheme
of
the
california
election
law
for
regulating
independent
access.
the
scheme
in
brief
is
this.
they
have
to
obtain
5%
of
the
registered
voters,
the
signatures
of
registered
voters
in
a
24-day
period.
that
period
begins
long
after
the
primary
elections
on
august
15
and
ended
on
september
8.
no
one
could
sign
one
of
those
petitions
who
voted
in
the
primary.
even
though
nonpartisans
vote
in
california
primary
elections,
they
are
given
a
nonpartisan
ballot.
it
doesn’t
have
such
offices
as
congress
and
senator
on
it,
but
has
ballot
propositions
in
local
offices,
county
and
city
which
are
nonpartisan
offices
in
california.
you
can’t
have
a
party
designation
for
those
offices.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
no
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
at
the
primary
election,
you
have
a
democratic
primary
or
republican
primary,
and
two
other
primaries.
additionally,
there
are
ballot
propositions.
the
number
used
to
be
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
20
these
years,
about
20
ballot
propositions
dealing
with
all
kinds
of
legislation.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
to
decide
legislation
--
we
decide
legislation
in
california
by
ballot,
voted
by
the
people.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
do
it
in
both.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes.
they
appear
on
both
ballots.
they
are
different
time
periods
and
sometimes
you
make
a
june
ballot
and
sometime
november
ballot.
and
the
june
ballot
comes
out
at
the
primary
election,
but
a
nonpartisan,
a
person
who
is
not
registered
with
any
political
party
goes
down
to
the
place
where
he
casts
his
ballot
and
is
given
what
is
called
a
nonpartisan
ballot
and
on
that
will
appear
all
the
ballot
propositions.
partisan
offices,
what
they
called
partisan
offices
in
california,
do
not
appear
on
that
ballot.
that
is
he
doesn’t
vote
for
anybody
for
congress
or
senate
or
president.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
but
he
votes
if
the
election
is
coterminous
for
such
offices
as
city
councilmen
and
supervisor
on
that
date.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
which
are
nonpartisan
and
so
you
have
a
person
who
go
to
the
primary
election
and
cast
ballot
and
yet
in
the
california
election
scheme,
although
they
haven’t
participated
in
the
partisan
primary,
they
are
not
permitted
to
sign
nominating
petitions
for
independents.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it's
not
by
most
persons’
terms
a
primary
election
so
called
in
california.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
no,
no.
california
is
a
bit
different.
there
was
a
--
in
the
early
part
of
the
century,
there
was
a
great
rebellion
against
the
party
system
and
california
setup
a
cross-filing
system
so
that
people
who
belong
one
party
can
run
in
the
other.
it
removed
any
party
designation
from
the
ballots
of
local
elections.
it
setup
the
initiative
from
referendum
so
these
ballot
propositions
appeared
at
that
time.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
but
they
kept
calling
it
a
primary
election.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes,
ride-in
candidate.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes,
this
–-
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
nonpartisan
ballots,
but
storer,
one
of
the
appellants
here
can
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
the
code
section
so
reads
then
that’s
what
the
lower
court
held.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
right.
that’s
it
exactly
although,
he
made
his
declaration
before
election
day,
you
have
to
be
registered
before
then.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well
anyway,
now,
those
people
excluded
from
signing
a
petition
and
the
appellant
storer
is
also
since
he
cast
a
nonpartisan
ballot
excluded
by
virtue
of
that
from
running
for
offices
as
an
independent,
and
further
he
is
not
permitted
to
run
as
an
independent
because
some
ten
months
before
the
general
election
he
was
registered
as
a
democrat
and
california
requires
you
if
you
been
a
member
of
a
political
party
to
wait
17
months
before
an
election,
before
you
can
be
an
independent.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
it’s
the
period
12
months
before
the
primary
election
and
then
you
add
the
five
months
then
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
right.
and
it
comes
out
about
17
months.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
before
you
can
run
as
an
independent
candidate
–-
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
--
you
have
to
purge
yourself
of
any
party
affiliations
some
17
months
before
the
general
election.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
right.
as
storer
here
asked
--
sought
and
there
is
an
affidavit
in
there,
he
sought
to
get
his
nominating
papers
out
and
he
told
them
he
could
not
have
them
because
he
been
registered
as
democrat
within
the
preceding
17
months.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
now,
this
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it’s
the
entire
vote
in
the
area.
so,
if
you
are
running
for
congress,
it
is
5%
in
your
congressional
district,
5%
of
the
people
who
voted
at
the
last
general
election.
if
you’re
running
statewide,
it
is
5%
of
the
entire
vote
in
the
state.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
it’s
our
estimate
and
it
was
the
estimate
of
the
secretary
of
the
state
at
the
time
the
election
was
being
held
that
about
70%
of
the
people
would
vote
for
primary.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
although
of
course
you
can
get
additional
registrations.
you
can
go
out
with
the
registration
book
and
get
additional
people
to
register.
if
you
are
in
the
district
with
very
low
registration,
that’s
one
way
where
you
can
conceivably
meet
these
requirements
and
in
fact
after
we
brought
these
suits,
somebody
did.
a
man
named
raul
ruiz
in
the
48th
assembly
district
of
california
which
is
the
smallest
assembly
district
where
all
he
needed
was
1,800
signatures.
a
large
chicano
population,
an
average
in
assembly
district
which
is
half
the
congressional
district
about
is
4,500
signatures
you
need.
he
needed
about
1,800,
very
low
registration
went
into
chicano
communities
and
promoted
himself
as
a
la
raza
candidate
and
was
able
to
make
the
ballot.
the
only
one
as
far
as
we
know
whose
ever
made
it
under
the
current
california
independent
provisions.
the
system
is
justified
by
the
state
of
the
california
on
the
grounds
that
makes
for
manageable
ballot
in
size
and
that
justification
we
contend
is
transparently
untenable
because
the
state
also
points
out
probably
a
few
times,
you
can
have
100
political
parties
in
california.
they
are
four
at
the
moment.
actually,
mathematically,
it
is
possible
to
have
more
than
100.
and
so,
the
interest
in
the
manageable
ballot
only
occurs
when
you
do
not
want
to
be
affiliated
with
a
political
party.
the
old
party
stay
on
if
they
have
1/15
of
1%
or
the
registry
vote,
and
if
they
collected
only
2%
of
the
vote
in
the
last
election.
a
new
party
needs
to
collect
just
1%
of
the
electorate
as
registered
voters
in
its
party
and
it
gets
a
place
in
the
ballot.
so
the
manageable
ballot
excuse
would
not
go
and
the
state
then
justifies
the
provision
on
the
grounds
that
may
legitimately
promote
political
parties
as
distinguished
from
independents,
and
even
keep
independence
off
of
the
ballot
if
it
wishes,
and
that
is
where
we
take
issue
with
the
state.
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
as
we
understated
any
way
is
supposed
to
promote
a
free
marketplace
of
ideas
and
a
statutory
system,
validly
designed
to
restrain
trading
ideas
does
not
seem
to
last
--
to
comport
with
the
first
amendment
but
to
affirm
it.
we
are
dealing
here
with
fundamental
right,
the
right
to
vote
and
the
ballot,
well
we
are
thinking
of
the
right
to
vote
on
first
amendment
terms
is
this
court
referred
to
it
williams
versus
rhodes
is
sort
of
a
form
and
while
the
state,
when
it
opens
the
form,
in
this
case
the
ballot
being
form
of
its
opening,
even
though
it
need
no
open
the
form,
once
it
opens
the
form,
it
has
to
use
neutral
principles
to
decide
who
gets
access
to
that
form.
it
can
decide
on
the
basis
of
preferred
political
content
or
preferred
political
associations
who
gets
on
the
ballot,
but
that
is
what
california
does
and
that
is
what
californian
claims
is
to
–-
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
it’s
an
equal
protection
principle.
it
is
related
to
the
first
amendment
principle.
under
the
equal
protection
ideas
when
one
opens
up
a
part
for
instance,
city
maybe
does
not
have
to
build
the
part
but
once
it
does,
it
is
going
to
issue
permits
for
speakers
in
the
part.
it
has
to
issue
them
in
a
neutral
manner,
that's
sort
of
a
combination
of
equal
protection
in
first
amendment
values
i
should
think.
but
we
are
relying
on
equal
protection
of
the
laws.
that
is
the
basic
claim
for
this
that
the
state
once
it
provides
ballots
base
has
to
do
it
in
an
even
head
in
the
matter
and
this
is
connected
and
interrelated
with
the
first
amendment
question
of
political
neutrality
in
deciding
what
standards
are
used
to
get
on
the
ballot.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
we're
claiming
that
the
state
discriminates
you
against
people
who
seek
ballot
positions
because
they
do
not
have
particular
kinds
of
associations.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
he
has
to
forgo
getting
on
the
ballot
and
yes,
he
can
forgo
all
he
wants
to
and
the
state
merely
penalizes
him
by
removing
him
from
the
actual
process,
and
the
removing
[laughter
attempt]
and
their
supporters
are
removed
from
the
electoral
process
effectively
and
force
to
have
on
their
ballots
only
those
candidates
which
they
do
not
wish
to
support.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
i
think
the
first
is
helpful
this
way
mr.
justice
blackmun
deciding
what
standard
is
then
used
to
determine
who
is
being
irrationally
discriminated
against,
and
we
maintain
the
first
amendment
sort
of
standard
applies
here
is
the
close
scrutiny
standard
and
that
what
we’re
involved
in
is
the
exercise
of
the
fundamental
right,
cognate
to
first
amendment
right
as
illuminated
in
this
court’s
opinion
in
williams
versus
rhodes.
the
discriminatory
system
against
those
unaffiliated
political
parties
is
reflected
not
just
in
the
ballot
direct
access
question,
but
on
in
the
statute
which
prohibited
storer
from
being
on
the
ballot.
we
have
already
discussed
his
casting
of
a
partisan
--
a
nonpartisan
primary
ballot
excluding
him
from
the
party.
and
i
mentioned
also
that
he
was
excluded
because
he
had
been
a
member
of
a
political
party
within
the
preceding
17
months.
and
we
contend
that
there
is
no
justification
for
the
provision.
it's
one
thing
that
requires
somebody
to
be
a
member
of
a
party
first
for
certain
amount
of
time
before
he
may
run
as
that
party’s
candidate
to
establish
his
adherence
to
whatever
general
principles
that
party
may
have,
but
an
independent
by
definition
is
saying
he
is
not
associated
with
any
group
of
political
ideas,
associated
with
any
particular
political
party.
the
state
of
california
says
well
when
he
goes,
he
is
splintering
the
party,
but
splinters
is
just
pejorative
for
independent,
and
i
would
think
political
parties
who
cannot
withstand
people
this
effect
at
leaving
that
party
and
cannot
stand
the
competition
at
the
ballot,
when
these
people
meet
least
of
the
qualifications
to
get
on
the
ballot
is
political
party
perhaps
does
not
have
where
does
the
people
who
want
to
buy
and
i
do
not
see
where
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
insulating
that
political
party
from
what
it
would
term
splinters,
i
do
not
know
who
decides
what
to
splinter
–-
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
mr.
remcho
argued
it
at
that
time
mr.
justice
douglas.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes,
for
mr.
storer
and
mr.
roche
appeared
for
the
state
at
that
time.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
we’d
hope
it
was
that
way.
i
do
not
know
that
whether
our
opening
was
well
settled.
we
feel
that
if
followed
fairly
much
from
williams
versus
rhodes
that
they
were
entitled
to
a
ballot
decision,
and
we
thought
and
furthered
it,
the
state
could
not
make
the
manageable
ballot
argument
because
if
you
pointed
out
that
interest
only
arises
when
you
are
affiliated
with
the
parties,
the
four-party
state
and
we
felt
further
that
the
state
can’t
maintain
that
it
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
promoting
political
parties,
people
affiliated
within
and
the
exclusions
of
those
who
have
no
political
party
affiliations.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
there
are
two
things
going
on
here
though.
the
independent
can’t
start
circulating
his
petition
until
late
august
while
the
primary
occurred
in
june.
so
that
in
order
to
get
5%
of
the
electorate
to
hang
around,
you’ve
got
to
convince
them
not
to
get
involved
back
in
that
process
at
all
if
california
had
a
system
which
gave
the
independents
an
equal
crack
at
the
same
time.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
i
don’t
think
it’s
unconstitutional
as
to
such
system
indeed
georgia
has
that
system,
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
unconstitutional
to
acquire
them
to
make
a
choice.
i
think
it
is
unconstitutional
to
give
the
parties
the
advantage.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it
is
violation
because
they
won’t
let
the
independent
compete
at
the
time
of
the
primary.
if
they’re
not
going
to
let
the
independent
compete
at
that
time
for
that
vote,
and
they
can’t
say
well
he’s
getting
two
bites
at
the
apple.
now,
if
they
want
to
let
him
--
the
independent
compete
at
the
same
time.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
that’s
all
very
well
if
independents
were
in
fact
like
a
political
party,
but
they’re
not.
they
are
different
kinds
of
people
who
are
independents.
mr.
frommhagen
does
not
get
along
with
mr.
hall
at
all,
and
he
is
not
going
to
get
together
with
him
at
any
convention.
the
idea
of
independence
is
that
they
are
not
organized.
if
somebody
wants
to
be
an
independent
candidate,
the
supporters
have
an
equal
opportunity
to
canvas
and
solicit
people
to
sign
nominating
petitions.
at
the
time
when
these
other
people
have
the
opportunity
to
have
them
go
to
the
polls
in
the
primaries,
then
i
would
say
you
can
make
a
distinction
so
you
got
to
make
your
choice.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
now,
what
happens
to
the
california
is
the
man
can’t
even
circulate
the
petitions
until
two
months
after
the
primary.
so,
he
is
completely
taken
out
of
that
arena
at
the
time
when
the
voters
are
most
thinking
about
the
issues.
that
the
parties
are
getting
this
tremendous
advantage
and
it
is
argued
that
that
gives
people
or
make
sure
that
they
reflect
current
attitudes.
well,
the
parties
do
not
reflect
any
current
attitudes.
it
is
been
two
years
since
the
election
in
which
they
relying
on
to
stay
on
the
ballot
and
yet,
an
independent
can’t
appear
in
january
or
february
and
start
soliciting
signatures
for
his
candidacy.
by
then,
an
independent
fairly
well
knows
what
the
main
issues
you
are
going
to
be
in
the
following
year,
and
that
independent
does
not
care
with
the
candidates
are.
maybe
that
independent
like
tom
storer
just
doesn’t
feel
the
political
parties
at
the
moment
are
properly
representing
the
people
if
they
are
too
much
grounded
by
interests
who
he
thinks
are
inimical
to
the
benefit
of
the
people
of
marion
county.
he
doesn’t
want
to
form
a
political
party,
he
doesn’t
care
what
happens
in
orange
county,
or
he
doesn’t
care
anymore
than
he
cares
with
that
in
klamoth
county
up
in
oregon.
he
is
interested
in
marion
county,
that
is
where
he
wants
to
run.
we
have
a
congressman
in
the
district
below
him,
a
mcclaskey
who
would
like
to
run
as
an
independent,
his
a
member
of
congress,
who
could
win
as
independent,
most
political
experts
think
but
may
be
you
cannot
get
through
a
republican
primary.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
he
doesn’t
want
any
backing
of
an
organized
political
party.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
pardon?
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes,
he
wants
to
get
elected.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
without
a
political
party’s
backing.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
it
won’t
be
a
party
under
the
terms
that
he
conceives
of
a
party.
if
he
gets
group
of
people
behind
him
to
support
him
who
are
not
connected
with
the
ongoing
institutional
group
tied
to
particular
interests.
he
feels
he
can
win.
he
does
not
want
to
be
tied
to
those
interests,
he
rather
loose,
but
it
is
not
a
just
a
candidacy,
he
is
a
genuine
candidate
as
mcclaskey
would
be
running
as
an
independent
and
mcclaskey
would
probably
win.
for
sure,
it
is
very
likely
he’d
win
in
his
district
because
it's
a
democratic
district
in
which
he
has
won
as
a
republican
constantly.
i
wonder
if
i
could
just
briskly
on
the
couple
of
other
points.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked
whether
lippitt
was
not
inconsistent
with
our
position
that
with
requiring,
you
not
to
have
been
a
member
of
a
party
for
a
year
an
a
half
violated
article
1,
section
2.
issue
was
never
raised
in
lippitt.
there
is
another
distinction
in
lippitt
in
that
we
were
talking
here
about
a
party
primary,
so
we
don’t
know
in
lippitt
from
what
at
least
occurs
in
the
lower
court
opinion
whether
that
person
was
absolutely
foreclosed
from
appearing
on
the
general
election
ballot
or
just
foreclosed
from
appearing
as
a
democratic
nominee.
but
here,
we
have
somebody
absolutely
foreclosed
because
it
belongs
to
a
class
from
which
he
can’t
escape.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
what
i
am
saying
in
lippitt,
the
issue
was
raised
essentially
as
an
equal
protection
one
and
you
can
go
into
all
kinds
of
balances
at
that
point,
but
article
1,
section
2
does
not
allow
for
balance.
if
it
is
a
qualification,
then
the
states
can't
add
it
and
that
issue
was
not
raised
in
lippitt
and
cases
do
not
stand
for
propositions
that
weren’t
raised.
i
think
that
goes
for
lippitt.
it
goes
for
minor
versus
happersett
which
is
sort
of
the
dred
scott
of
women’s
liberation
[laughter
attempt].
that
that
did
not
involve
the
equal
protection
clause
which
is
the
principal
clause
we
were
relying
on.
it
is
privileges
and
immunities
case
and
so
at
that
case
seems
to
be
the
only
one
that
suggest
that
voting
is
not
a
constitution
right
protected
at
least
in
congressional
elections.
that
case
does
not
go
to
the
principal
issue.
on
that
point,
mr.
justice
marshall
raised
a
question
about
whether
a
classic
involve
the
right
of
a
candidate
to
run
for
office.
it
is
on
page
308
--
313
u.s.
says
they
were
charged
with
interfering,
with
the
free
exercise
of
the
right
of
candidates
to
run
for
the
office
of
congressman,
and
they
have
--
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
right.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
no,
it
was
group
of
--
it
was
section
19
and
20
case
that
was
a
criminal
prosecution
for
people
for
interfering
with
the
right
of
those
candidates
to
run
for
office.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
i’d
say
your
honor
at
page
308,
this
is
the
right
of
the
candidates
to
run
for
office.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
oh,
let
me
move
to
abstention
just
for
a
moment.
it
was
not
raised
below.
there
responses
filed
on
august
18,
not
three
months
--
not
three
weeks
before
the
election.
in
august,
they
filed
a
response
to
not
raise
the
abstention
issue.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
no,
no,
it
was
august
18,
1972.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
yes.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it
was
filed
before
the
primary
election.
the
answer
was
filed
on
august.
we
have
the
preliminary
--
hearing
and
preliminary
injunction
on
august
31.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
“declines
to
state,”
no
matter
how
much
you
want
to
stay.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
i
do
not
know
we’ve
really
handled
this
–-
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
when
i
brought
the
case,
i
had
to
assume
that
the
language
in
the
code
section
meant
what
it
said,
and
i
had
to
attack
that
section.
then
mr.
roche
came
in
and
found
that
he
could
not
come
up
with
any
justification
with
that
section
so
it
does
not
mean
that,
and
i
said
that
is
fine
with
me.
let
us
not
argue
about
that.
however,
the
district
court
ignored
the
concession,
so
here
we
are.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
interpret
it
anyway
other
--
if
you
interpret
the
way
the
district
court
interprets
it,
it
is
clearly
unconstitutional.
nobody
could
come
up
with
a
justification
for
it.
it
seems
to
me
if
the
state
tells
you
that
it
ought
to
be
interpreted
the
other
way
that
you
do
not
have
any
real
problem
of
–-
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
i
would
suppose
it
and
the
only
answer
is
that
if
as
i
contend
it,
it
is
clearly
facially
unconstitutional
is
to
hold
an
unconstitutional
and
if
the
state
court
wants
to
say
you
made
an
error
the
way
you
read
it,
they
can
do
that
and
revive
–-
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
well,
one
difficulty
was
that
is
though
we
did
not
file
that
suit
three
weeks
before
the
election.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
we
get
another
election
coming
up
in
1974.
now,
if
we
go
back
and
you
abstain
them
we
got
to
go
for
the
superior
court
of
california
and
appeal
at
the
court
of
appeal.
effectively,
we’re
talking
about
a
couple
of
more
years
of
litigation,
and
we
are
talking
about
a
very
fundamental
right
here.
and
i
do
not
know
that
when
you
are
talking
in
the
selection
context
about
the
very
fundamental
rights
that
states
come
up
with
ambiguity.
i
do
not
agree
that
it’s
an
ambiguity,
but
the
state
wants
to
create
an
ambiguity
by
saying
it
is
not
we
meant.
i
don’t
think
they
can
by
that
ploy
force
us
to
pass
another
election
without
knowing
whether
we
can
run
on
the
grounds
somewhat
equivalent
with
the
parties.
you
know
some
sort
of
parity,
people
who
are
not
affiliated
with
the
political
party
so
that
they
are
invidiously
discriminated
against.
mr.
paul
n.
halvonik
it
is
indeed.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
