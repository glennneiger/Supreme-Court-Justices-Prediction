you
say
it

they

i

your

the
judgment
that
brought
you
up

but
pursuing
justice
marshall’s
question
a
little
bit
further,
is
it
possible
to
readily
identify
the
people
who
have
just
voted
as
justice

suggested
on
some
of
the
other
issues

not
on
any
part

checking

that
done

party
primary
and
then
seeks
to
sign
a
petition
for
an
independent
candidate,
have
they
something
like
the
equivalent
of
two
votes
in
the
process?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
they
see
no
reason
why
not
to
let
a
man
vote
in
republican
primary
first
and
democratic
primary
at
the
same
time?
is
that
the
analogy?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
alright.
mr.
halvonik,
what
about
that
proposition,
my
hypothetical
question
that
you
demand;
a
man
is
gone
and
voted
in
the
republican
primary
let
us
say
and
then
he
is
dissatisfied
with
the
results
of
that
primary.
on
your
theory,
he
should
be
permitted
to
vote,
to
sign
a
petition
for
an
independent?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
do
you
think
they
--
my
question
is
do
you
think
they
should
have
to
bites
at
it;
to
vote
in
the
primary
of
the
democrats
or
the
republicans
and
then
in
effect
get
a
“vote”
by
having
his
signature
on
the
petition
function
the
same
as
to
vote
in
the
primary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
suggesting
it
is
unconstitutional,
are
you
not
to
fail
to
allow
that?
that
if
they
do
not
--
if
california
does
not
allow
a
man
to
vote
in
the
republican
primary
and
then
when
he
does
not
like
the
results,
sign
a
petition
for
an
independent
candidate,
you
are
saying
that
is
a
violation
of
some
constitutional
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
that
prevents
the
independents
from
saying
that
we
are
going
to
have
a
convention
of
independence
on
the
day
of
the
primary?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
don’t
go
to
the
republican,
don’t
go
to
the
general
primary
but
come
to
our
convention
and
sign
a
pledge
card
that
you
will
sign
a
petition,
anything?
