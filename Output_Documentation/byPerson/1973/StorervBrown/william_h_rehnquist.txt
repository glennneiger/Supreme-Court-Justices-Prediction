mr.
remcho,
if
you
are
right
on
the
point
you
are
arguing
here
then
was
not
lippitt
against
cipollone
wrongly
decided?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
ohio
rule
was
surely
an
added
qualification
which
the
state
couldn't
impose
over
and
above
those
set
by
article
1
just
as
much
as
the
california
qualification.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
think
(voice
overlap)
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
are
more
liberal
and
less
fluid?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
it's
about
three
weeks
before
the
election
t
too,
isn't
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
there
really
a
problem
mr.
roche
of
republicans
and
democrats
desiring
to
vote
as
independents
in
order
to
nominate
the
weakest
independent
candidate
so
that
the
republican
or
democrat,
a
candidate
might
triumph
at
the
general
election?
isn’t
that
how
the
analogy
would
go
if
you
talk
in
terms
of
party
rating?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
that
is
good
argument
as
to
the
prohibition
against
those
who
have
voted
in
a
party
primary,
not
nominating
any
independent.
i
take
it
that
this
is
not
a
very
good
argument
as
to
those
who
have
voted
nonpartisan
analogy?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course,
your
argument
under
article
1,
section
2
isn't
absolute
foreclosure,
it’s
burdening
or
increasing.
and
it
is
seems
to
me
they
are
the
same
on
that
point
whether
you
might
reach
a
different
result
because
the
foreclosure
argument
or
not?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
after
the
election,
wasn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
what
–-
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
this
was
directed
not
to
the
primary,
but
not
to
the
getting
on
the
ballot
in
the
primary
but
to
get
out
in
general?
