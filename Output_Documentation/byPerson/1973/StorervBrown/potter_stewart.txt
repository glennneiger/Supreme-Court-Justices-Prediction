justice
potter
stewart
what
you’re
getting
into
now
is
something
i
didn’t
quite
understand
when
i
read
the
briefs.
a
person
can
go
into
a
republican
primary
and
vote
say,
say
it
is
republican
primary
equally
true
about
the
democratic
primary
and
vote,
although
he
declines
to
state
that
he
is
a
republican
in
one
case
or
democrat
in
the
other
and
what
seems
--
does
he
vote
for
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
what
does
he
vote
for?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
to
put
issues
onto
the
ballot
at
the
general
election?
justice
potter
stewart
could
you
do
that
in
the
primary
election,
not
the
general
election?
justice
potter
stewart
or
--
justice
potter
stewart
uh-huh.
justice
potter
stewart
which
are
nonpartisan?
justice
potter
stewart
so
voter
on
primary
election
day
goes
down
to
the
polling
place
and
he
can
say
i
am
a
republican
in
which
case
he
is
given
a
ballot
containing
the
various
aspirants
for
to
be
nominated
under
republican
party
plus
the
issues
in
nonpartisan
candidates
or
in
some
a
democrat
in
which
case
he
gets
the
democratic
ballot
plus
the
issues,
or
he
can
say
decline
--
i
decline
to
state
in
which
he
gets
only
the
latter?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
justice
potter
stewart
and
that
is
before
you
can
be
a
candidate,
not
before
you
can
vote
in
the
primary,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
candidate?
justice
potter
stewart
before
you
can
be
a
candidate
as
an
independent?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
and
how
many
voters
just
to
take
to
organize
a
new
party
mr.
clayton
p.
roche?
1/15
of
1%?
justice
potter
stewart
i
don't
follow
that?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
georgia
was
more
liberal.
party
still
stays
on
the
–-
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
about
it.
justice
potter
stewart
so,
you
are
telling
us
--
do
i
understand
you
correctly,
you
are
telling
us
what
despite
what
the
federal
district
court
seemed
to
hold
on
this
case,
the
california
law
may
be
to
the
contrary?
justice
potter
stewart
well
then
would
not
this,
if
there
is
an
ambiguity
would
this
have
been
appropriate
case
for
the
district
court
to
have
abstained
to
get
the
california
law
construed
by
the
only
court’s
qualified
to
do
it
and
is
the
california
court?
justice
potter
stewart
but
by
a
federal
court
that
you
can
qualify?
justice
potter
stewart
you
mean
a
construction
then
contrary
to
the
holding
of
the
district
court
in
this
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but
not
really
on
the
point,
not
on
this
precise
issue,
is
it?
justice
potter
stewart
i
mean
that
the
holding
here
was
by
the
district
court
as
i
understand
it
at
least
that
because,
one
of
these
people
had
voted
as
an
independent,
has
to
refused
to
state
--
client
to
state
voter
at
a
so
called
primary
which
he
didn’t
vote
in
the
party
primary?
for
that
by
that
very
reason,
he
is
disabled
to
run
as
an
independent
candidate
within
the
17-months
period.
and
you
say
that
is
not
the
california
law
and
how
we
to
know,
we
have
no
power
to
construe
the
california
statutes,
not
at
all?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
am
suggesting
to
you
that
we,
this
court
has
no
power
whatsoever
to
construe
the
meaning
of
a
california
statute.
if
it
is
clear,
that
is
one
thing
and
we
accept
it
but
you
and
your
adversary
seemed
to
disagree
as
to
what
the
california
law
is
and
that
say
disagreement
that
this
court
has
absolutely
no
power
to
resolve?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
up
to
the
california
courts.
justice
potter
stewart
but
this,
but
the
three-judge
district
court
in
this
case
did
not
so
understand
it?
it
said
very,
very
clearly
on
iii
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
of
the
appendix,
storer
will
be
barred
from
independent
candidacy
if
he
carried
out
his
stated
intention
of
voting
on
nonpartisan
matters
in
the
june
primary?
justice
potter
stewart
was
there
any
of
point
made
to
the
three-judge
district
court
in
this
case
that
it
should
not
defer,
should
abstain
from
reaching
the
constitutional
issues
here
ending
a
determination
of
what
the
california
law
is
by
the
california
courts?
justice
potter
stewart
the
election
was
in
november?
justice
potter
stewart
alright.
justice
potter
stewart
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
halvonik,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
abstention
was
raised
below,
doesn’t
it
appear
here
as
was
exposed
by
my
brother
blackmun
that
there
is
an
argument
between
you
and
your
brothers
on
the
other
side
as
to
what
the
california
law
is,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
man
who
voted
down
as
a
refuse
to
what
do
you
call
him,
“declines
to
state?”
justice
potter
stewart
“declines
to
state”
and
the
primary
as
to
his
eligibility
to
run
as
a
candidate?
justice
potter
stewart
you
seem
to
disagree
as
to
what
the
california
law
is
and
as
we
all
know
that
is
a
question
we
could
not
resolve,
we
have
no
power
to.
justice
potter
stewart
i
know.
justice
potter
stewart
but
the
--
i
do
not
know
what
your
california
law
is
in
this
respect,
but
i
would
guess
maybe
that
mr.
roche
is
hardly
authorized
to
tell
us
that
his
statute
means
something
other
than
what
it
appears
to
say?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
not
the
only
alternative.
another
alternative
would
be
to
remand
the
case
to
get
an
authoritative
construction
from
the
california
courts.
justice
potter
stewart
what
you’re
getting
into

is

justice

that
is

justice

before

justice

right.
justice
