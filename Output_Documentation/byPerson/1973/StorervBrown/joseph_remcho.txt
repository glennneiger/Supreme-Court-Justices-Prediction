mr.
joseph
remcho
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first,
in
response
to
mr.
justice
douglas’
question
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
oh,
okay.
we
have
thought
at
the
time
at
any
rate
the
irreparable
injury
to
the
--
there
was
no
injury
to
the
state
but
there
would
be
injury
to
storer
in
that
case.
i
am
addressing
myself
to
the
issue
that
independent
candidates
to
get
on
the
ballot
may
not
have
been
a
member
of
a
political
party
for
the
preceding
17
months
and
may
not
have
voted
at
the
preceding
primary.
in
our
view,
that
is
qualifications
by
the
california
legislature
to
those
set
forth
in
article
1
section
2.
in
this
court,
in
powell
versus
mccormack
said
that
the
national
legislature
may
not
add
to
those
qualifications
of
age,
citizenship
and
inhabitancy.
as
the
national
legislature
cannot
and
surely
the
state
may
not
and
in
fact
appellees
have
conceded
this
point.
they
argue
however
that
person
can
be
elected
to
congress
in
two
other
ways
besides
meeting
those
additional
qualifications.
that
is
they
argue,
he
can
be
a
party
candidate
or
that
it
can
succeed
the
ride-in
--
on
the
ride-in
at
the
--
in
the
california
election.
these
possibilities,
really
in
our
view
constitute
merely
alternative
qualifications.
to
restate
the
california
scheme,
a
person
to
become
a
member
of
congress
must
either
first,
be
a
member
of
recognized
political
party,
that
is
the
party
group;
second,
must
not
have
been
a
member
of
the
party
with
preceding
17
months
and
further
have
not
had
voted;
that’s
this
independent
group
we
are
challenging.
or
third,
he
must
run
as
ride-in
candidate
with
no
chance
to
success
in
california.
i
think
the
issue
this
court
want
to
address
itself
to
is
the
viability
of
the
ride-in
as
an
option.
i
think
it
can
be
viewed
in
one
of
two
ways.
either
it’s
that
alternative
qualification
that
a
person
must
be
so
widely
supported
by
people
in
california
that
he
can
gain
election
even
when
his
supporters
have
to
ride-in
and
the
supporters
of
others
by
merely
go
down
and
check
a
mark
on
the
voting
machine.
or
secondly,
we
can
say
that
the
party
group
and
independent
group
are
the
additional
qualifications
for
the
congress
and
that
the
alternative
which
the
state
provides
is
really
an
unrealistic
alternative.
it
is
impossible
alternative
under
current
california
procedure.
the
appellees
attempt
i
think
to
show
that
there
is
a
ride-in
alternative
really
shows
quite
the
opposite.
the
only
example
they
can
come
up
with
is
the
case
in
which
a
person
who
is
a
democratic
incumbent
and
already
on
the
ballot
for
the
democratic
primary,
won
a
republican
primary
in
by
ride-in
when
no
one
was
on
a
republican
ballot
that
is
someone
had
to
win
by
ride-in,
there
is
no
other
way
to
do
it.
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
think
the
court
in
lippitt,
that’s
the
lower
case,
your
honor
did
not
address
fully
that
issue
of
article
1
section
2.
it
was
passed
on,
was
not
fully
explored.
i
think
i
am
correct,
it
was
wrongly
--
maybe
wrongly
decided.
secondly
however,
that’s
distinguishable
from
this
case
in
that
in
lippitt,
there
was
a
fee
and
i
suppose
arguably,
the
candidate
in
lippitt
could
have
raised
the
fee.
in
this
case
he
can't
--
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
think
that’s
right
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
i
would
say
number
one,
it
was
wrongly
decided.
this
court
dismissed
on
the
grounds
of
lack
of
jurisdiction.
it
did
not
–-
mr.
joseph
remcho
excuse
me,
excuse
me.
i
am
sorry.
i’m
thinking
of
the
other
case.
but
i
think
that
can
be
distinguished
here
because
there
is
no
way
that
storer
can
get
away
from
california’s
requirement,
that
is
having
voted,
having
exercise
his
franchise
and
having
been
a
member
of
the
party,
he
is
now
totally
incapable
of
getting
on
the
ballot
in
california
whereas
in
lippitt
at
least
someone
else
could
have
come
in
and
said
here’s
the
money
and
you
can
go.
again
as
to
the
ride-in
alternative,
this
court
in
classic,
united
states
versus
classic
which
extended
what
it
considered
to
be
a
fundamental
right
to
vote
in
congressional
elections
to
primary
elections
did
so
on
the
grounds
that
the
primary
election
so
profoundly
effected
the
general
election
–-
mr.
joseph
remcho
they
use
the
term
constitutional
right,
mr.
justice
brennan.
mr.
joseph
remcho
i
will
in
the
future.
mr.
joseph
remcho
but
i
think
that
case
which
also
spoke
of
article
1,
section
2
not
specifically
to
the
qualifications,
but
as
one
of
the
basis
for
the
constitutional
right.
it
fit
so
because
it
dismissed
the
ride-in
because
the
ride-in
procedure
in
the
primary
so
profoundly
effected
the
election.
mr.
joseph
remcho
no,
that
was
a
case
--
that
is
right
to
be
counted
and
also
to
be
a
candidate
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
joseph
remcho
that
is
correct.
mr.
joseph
remcho
well,
i
think
now
mr.
justice
marshall,
the
decision
--
this
was
a
case
in
which
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
defendants
in
that
case
violated
a
constitutional
right.
the
court
said
it
had
to
meet
two
issues.
first,
whether
or
not
a
voter
had
a
right
to
have
his
ballot
counted
and
secondly,
the
court
did
say
that
it
had
to
meet
the
issue
whether
or
not
a
person
had
a
right
to
be
a
candidate.
one
might
say
that
there
really
was
not
necessarily
in
the
case?
mr.
joseph
remcho
that
is
right.
to
be
a
candidate
and
to
have
those
accounted
for
--
i
think
further
that
--
i
think
the
issue
has
been
settled
by
powell
versus
mccormack
and
that
mr.
justice
--
excuse
me,
mr.
chief
justice
warren
in
that
case
gave
some
guidelines
we
are
looking
at
a
case
of
this
sort
where
qualifications
are
alleged
and
he
said
that
even
had
the
legislative
history
in
that
case
not
been
as
clear
as
it
was
and
the
constitutional
history
not
been
as
clear
as
it
was,
the
court
was
nevertheless
had
been
compelled
to
resolved
any
ambiguity
in
favor
of
a
now
construction
as
the
scope
of
congress’
power
to
exclude
members
because
in
hamilton’s
words
the
people
should
choose
whom
they
please
to
govern
them.
i
think
in
this
case,
any
ambiguity
as
to
whether
or
not
the
ride-in
is
an
effective
alternative
ought
to
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
people’s
right
to
elect
the
congress
those
people
whom
they
choose
and
not
whom
the
california
legislature
chooses.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
mr.
halvonik’s
rebuttal.
mr.
joseph
remcho
mr.

and
may
it
