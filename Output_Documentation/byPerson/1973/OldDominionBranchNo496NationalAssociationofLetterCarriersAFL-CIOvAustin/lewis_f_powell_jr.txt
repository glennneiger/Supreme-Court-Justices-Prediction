mr.
ratner,
i
don’t
suppose
you
found
in
the
dictionary
any
definition
of
scab
and
here
i
quote
from
page
72,
i
think,
of
the
appendix,
“as
a
traitor
to
his
god,
his
country,
his
family,
and
his
class.”
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

my
questions
was,
is
it
in
the
dictionary?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
inquire
what
the
circulation
of
the
monthly
newsletter
was?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
it’s
your
position
that
this
is
a
news
media
entitled
to
the
same
principles
that
protect
the
new
york
times?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,

is
any
limit
on
this?
i
live
in
an
apartment
here
in
washington,
that
publishes
monthly
a
little
mini
graph
sheet;
sometimes
it’s
a
page,
sometimes
it’s
a
couple
of
pages,
news
about
our
apartment.
would
that
be
the
equivalent
of
the
news
media
for
constitutional
purposes?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
assume
there
was
no
publication
whatever
and
the
manager
of
the
apartment
falsely
accused
the
tenant
of
misconduct,
would
that
be
subject
to
the
same
protection
as
the
principle
annunciated
in
new
york
times,
gives
people
in
the
press?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
in
other
words,
you
draw
the
line
between
media
as
broadly
defined
by
you
on
the
one
hand
and
what
an
individual
may
say
in
his
individual
capacity?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
well,
suppose
he
--
suppose
the
slander
were
heard
in
a
stomp
speech
on
a
corner
of
a
public
street.
would
the
speaker
have
the
same
protection
as
a
news
media?
