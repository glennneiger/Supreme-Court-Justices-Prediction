mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
judgment
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
affirming
three
separate
judgments
of
$55,000
each,
a
nice
figure
of
$165,000
in
all,
against
the
richmond
branch
of
the
national
association
of
letter
carriers
and
the
parent
national
association.
the
three
plaintiffs,
beneficiaries
to
these
judgments,
are
individual
letter
carriers
who
refused
deliberately
and
willfully
to
join
the
union.
because
of
that
refusal,
they
were
identified
as
scabs
in
the
local
branch’s
monthly
newsletter
to
its
members
and,
in
one
issue,
the
branch
published
pejorative
definition
of
scab,
popularly
attributed
to
jack
london
followed
by
a
list
of
scabs
which
named
the
non-members,
some-15
of
them
including
the
three
plaintiffs.
at
least
since
1897,
according
the
century
dictionary
encyclopedia
which
is
quoted
at
page
51
of
the
appendix,
in
labor
parlance,
a
scab
is
workman
who
is
not
or
refuses
to
become
a
member
of
a
labor
union.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
that
definition
was
not
printed,
but
the
record
is
unequivocally
clear
that
all
of
the
plaintiffs
and
everyone
else
knew
that
the
reason
they
were
being
called
scabs
was
that
they
had
been
importuned
and
pleaded
with
and
begged
to
join
the
union
and
they
refused
willfully
and
deliberately
to
do
so.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes,
sir.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
no,
i
have
no
meaning,
no
implication
in
that
word
in
that
context
other
than
“they
were
not
newly
on
the
job
and
not
had
a
chance
not
be
approached,
had
not
had
the
chance
to
consider
the
problem.”
they
had
made
a
deliberate
choice
is
all
i
meant
to
say.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
will
change
it.
they
had
deliberately
elected
not
to
joint
the.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
i
was
coming
to
that.
i
mean
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
i
don’t
suppose
that
the
dictionaries
go
on
and
print
jack
london’s
definition
as
being
part
of
the
commonly
accepted
definition
of
a
scab.
jack
london
was
elaborated
in
literary
fashion
about
what
is
conception
of
a
scab
was.
it’s
not
a
literary
dictionary
definition
of
a
scab.
it’s
an
artist’s
conception.
the
publication
itself
did
not.
in
fact,
the
publication
does,
page
52,
i
believe,
of
the
record
or
maybe
it’s
74.
in
any
event,
immediately
after
the
article
itself
appeared,
at
page
77,
appears
a
card
from
which
the
editor
of
the
local
paper
derived
the
text
of
the
article.
that
was
published
by
the
richmond
trades
industry
of
council
and
that,
defendant’s
exhibit
5,
clearly
shows
that
a
scab
by
jack
london,
well-known
author
of
call
of
the
wild,
sea
wolf,
etcetera.
when,
as
your
honors
will
see,
the
local
branch
in
response
to
a
question
by
plaintiff
austin,
saying
he
didn’t
know
what
a
scab
was,
published
the
london
definition.
it
said
that
“some
people
seem
to
be
in
a
quandary
as
to
what
a
scab
is,
we
offer
the
following.”
it
did
not
say
that
it
was
the
only
definition.
it
did
not
say
it
was
a
dictionary
definition.
it
said
that
it
was
a
definition
and,
a
definition
it
certainly
was,
consisting
of
a
well-known
literary
labor
classic
attributed
at
least,
or
if
not
written,
by
jack
london.
in
any
event
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes,
sir.
i
do
believe
that
the
century
dictionary
encyclopedia,
which
i
quoted
earlier,
dated
1897
describes
a
scab
as
“an
opprobrious
term
used
by
the
workmen
or
others
who
dislike
his
action.”
now,
i
assume
that
that
means
that
to
trade
unionists
those
who
refuse
to
join
are
low
and
contemptible
people.
the
record
here
reflects
that
both
the
president
of
the
local
union
and
the
vice
president
of
the
national
stated
their
reasons
for
believing
that
so-called
free
riders
who
take
the
advantage
of
union
representation
without
bearing
their
fair
share
of
the
cost
or
any
share
of
the
cost,
who
are
willing
to
profit
from
the
benefits
and
the
efforts
of
their
fellows
to
maintain
wages
and
working
conditions,
who
do
as
one
of
the
plaintiffs
here
did,
ziegengeist,
perform
services
off
the
clock
on
free
time,
gratis,
for
his
employer
are
in
fact
low
and
contemptible
people.
they
choose
to
undermine
the
conditions
for
which
workers
organized
and
they
fought
and
struggled.
that
is
their
opinion
of
them,
and
it
is
our
contention
that
both
the
national
relations
laws
and
the
first
amendment
guarantee
their
right
among
themselves
to
express
that
opinion
for
the
lawful
purpose
of
exerting
social
pressure
upon
the
non-members
to
join.
now,
we
think
that
that
proposition
is
supported
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
the
questions
principally
presented
are
whether,
as
a
matter
of
federal
preemption,
a
state’s
jurisdiction
over
defamation
arising
out
of
labor
disputes
is
limited
to
knowing
or
reckless
misrepresentation
of
fact.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
your
honor,
i
take
it
that
there
is
no
line
that
can
be
drawn
constitutionally
between
the
vividness
of
the
hyperbole
which
can
be
protected
and
that
which
is
not.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
constitution
or
linn,
either
one,
distinguish
the
epithets
which
are
particularly
remarked
in
linn
as
falling
within
the
common
place
discussion,
and
one
of
the
labor
board
cases
which
specifically
says
that
this
london
definition
itself
is
protected
under
section
7
as
falling
without
the
area
of
protected
speech
in
labor
controversies,
whereas,
this
court
said
in
linn
itself,
“we
do
not
judge
by
the
normal
standards
of
gentleman
linn
polite
speech.”
in
labor
controversies,
the
court
has
pointed
out
that
the
labor
disputes
are
ordinarily
heated
affairs.
the
language
of
this
common
place
there
might
well
be
deemed
actionable
per
se
in
some
state
jurisdictions.
representation
campaigns
are
frequently
characterized
by
bitter
and
extreme
charges,
counter-charges,
unfounded
rumors,
vituperations,
personal
accusations,
misrepresentations
and
distortions.
both
labor
and
management
often
speak
bluntly
and
recklessly,
embellishing
their
respective
positions
within
precatory
language.
that
was
worked
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes,
sir?
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
this
arose
out
of
the
efforts
of
the
union
to
bring
into
membership
the
remaining
non-members
who
were
employed
in
the
postal
career
services.
to
answer
your
question
shortly
and
bluntly,
there
was
no
legal
proceeding
pending
before
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
no,
as
far
as
we
know.
there
was
a
dispute
between
the
members
of
the
union
and
the
non-members
which,
in
senn
versus
tile
layers
union
this
court
has
held
to
constitute
a
labor
dispute
and
which
section
29
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
explicitly
defines
as
a
labor
dispute,
and
which
angelos
against
cafeteria
workers
explicitly
holds
as
labor
dispute.
any
effort
by
a
union
to
induce
non-members
to
join
is
per
se
a
labor
dispute,
yes.
now,
in
that
context,
to
come
back
to
what
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes,
your
honor,
and
it’s
absolutely
true.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
it
is
precisely
that,
it
is
precisely
that
and
we
say
that
it
is
rhetorical
hyperbole
not
because
we
say
so,
but
because
under
the
teachings
of
greenbelt
against
bresler,
it
must
be
so-held
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
fact
and
that
the
lower
court’s
attempt
without
any
rationale
whatsoever,
the
district
court
i
mean,
attempt
without
rationale
whatsoever,
to
say
that
bresler
is
completely
different
from
this
case
is
simply
utterly
intemperate.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
thank
you.
[luncheon
recess]
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
refer
to
two
other
passages
of
linn
which
have
relevance,
at
least,
here.
one
is
that
the
labor
board
has
concluded
that
epithets
such
as
“scab,”
“unfair,”
and
“liar”
are
common
place
in
these
struggles.
i
might
add,
as
common
place
as
the
london
definition,
and
not
so
indefensible
as
to
remove
them
from
the
protection
of
section
7,
even
though
the
statements
are
erroneous
and
defame
one
of
the
parties
to
the
dispute,
it's
on
pages
60-61,
and
i
continue
having
skipped
a
sentence
on
page
61
to
the
following.
in
sum,
the
board
tolerates
intemperate,
abusive,
and
inaccurate
statements
made
by
the
union
during
attempts
to
organize
employees,
which
was
what
this
was.
it
does
not
interpret
the
act
as
giving
either
party
license
to
injure
the
other
intentionally
by
circulating
defamatory
or
insulting
material
known
to
be
false.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
your
honor,
i
--
to
me,
the
only
hand
that
counts
is
the
last
four
words,
“known
to
be
false,”
versus
the
common
law
test,
embodies
the
new
york
times
test,
and
lays
down
the
boundary
of
state
court
jurisdiction.
in
order
for
a
statement
to
be
known
to
be
false
it
must
be
factual,
because
if
it
is
not
factual,
as
judge
marriage
said
in
speaking
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
curtis
publishing
co.
against
birdsong
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
then
it
simply
is
not
subject
to
the
litmus
paper
test
of
truth
or
false
until
you
talk,
and
if
it’s
not
subject
to
the
litmus
paper
test
truth
or
false,
then
it
can’t
come
within
the
scope
of
state
court
jurisdiction
under
linn.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i’m
inclined
to
believe
they
would,
unless
opinions
were
matters
of
fact
which,
conceivably,
they
might
be.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
in
other
words,
i
might
have
an
opinion
of
your
honor
and
state
the
contrary,
one
falsely
and
maliciously,
and
that,
i
think,
might
be
actionable.
but
hyperbole,
hyperbole
certainly
falls
on
the
other
side
of
the
line,
and
that’s
the
point
i
really
want
to
make.
that
if
rhetorical
hyperbole,
which
is
what
the
london
statement
is,
is
protected
constitution
and
protected
on
the
phrase
that
i
read
in
linn,
then
the
protection
must
be
coextensive
with
the
artist’s
imagination
and
certainly
commensurate
with
the
depth
of
the
sentiment
or
the
emotion
in
this
case,
particularly
revolution
against
workers
who
refuse
to
join
their
fellows
in
the
union
which
the
artist
is
seeking
to
express.
actually,
the
images
of
the
revoked
--
that
are
revoked
by
the
london
literature
are
not
too
difficult
to
compare
with
the
image
invoked
and
whose
favorable,
who
can
say,
“by
those
people
who
called
bresler
a
blackmailer,”
which,
in
bresler,
this
court
held
enjoyed
constitutional
protection,
and
as
the
chief
justice
said
speaking
for
this
court
in
organization
for
better
austin
versus
keefe.
“as
long
as
the
means
of
circulating
such
statements,
and
by
such
statements
in
that
parenthetical
expression,
i
mean,
extravagant
rhetorical
hyperbole,
are
peaceful,
the
communication
need
not
meet
standards
of
acceptability.”
standards
of
acceptability
for
good
hyperbole
and
bad
hyperbole,
there
are
none,
and
i
suggest--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes,
your
honor.
as
it
happens,
austin
was
a
prior
restraint
case.
but,
what
is
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
understand
that
the
general
framework
of
austin
was
near
versus
minnesota
and
the
prior
restraint.
but,
what
is
said
there
about
the
first
amendment
and
about
the
reasons
for
knocking
down
the
rationale
of
the
illinois
court
which
said
that
what
it
was
doing
was
protecting
the
privacy
of
this
businessman
to
conduct
his
business
the
way
he
chose
to
do
legally,
and
as
the
laws
of
the
state
of
illinois
gave
him
the
right
to
conduct,
and
who
chose
and
elected
not
to
sign
the
contract
that
this
organization
placed
before
him
and
demanded
that
sign,
and
the
supreme
court
held
that
that
was
an
invasion
of
his
privacy
and
it
further
held
that
the
leafleting
was
not
protected
because
it
was
a
means
of
coercing
him
to
change
his
business
practices
rather
than
as
a
means
of
communicating
ideas.
the
striking
down
of
those
arguments
was
a
matter
of
the
philosophy
of
the
first
amendment
not
near
versus
minnesota
and
prior
restraint.
now,
in
one
place,
we
distinguish
this
case
most
seriously
from
the
case
that
preceded
it.
workmen
drawn
together
in
a
common
occupation
by
a
common
employer
worked
together
whether
they
liked
it
or
not,
they’re
in
a
common
community,
and
a
choice
to
bond
together
as
a
union
and
to
become
members
of
the
same
organization
and
participate
in
its
affairs
and
to
contribute
to
its
upkeep
and
to
abide
by
its
rules
and
by
its
laws
is
a
voluntary
choice
that
each
of
them
must
make
in
the
society
in
which
we
live.
i
take
the
liberty
from
quoting
from
this
court’s
decision
in
time
versus
hill,
385
us
38.
“exposure
of
the
self
to
others
in
varying
degrees
is
a
concomitant
of
life
in
a
civilized
community.
the
risk
of
this
exposure
is
an
essential
incident
of
life
in
a
society
which
places
a
primary
value
on
freedom
of
speech
and
of
press.”
and
so,
every
letter
carrier
exposes
himself
to
the
good
or
ill
will
of
his
fellows,
those
who
are
union
members
and
those
who
are
not,
and
when
he
makes
the
decision
or
when
he
makes
the
choice
to
join
them
in
their
union
or
not.
he
by
the
same
token,
makes
a
choice
of
securing
their
social
good
will
or
their
social
ill
will.
our
opponents,
indeed,
concede
that
the
union
has
a
right
to
publish
the
fact
of
their
scabness,
that
they
are
scabs,
and
by
publishing
it,
they
seek
to
induce
other
letter
carriers
to
exert
social
pressure
upon
them
to
join
the
union.
they
say
“but
they
don’t
have
the
right
to
do
it
by
extravagant
hyperbole.”
we
say,
they
do
because
the
first
amendment
protects
extravagant
hyperbole
if
it
protects
the
right
to
speak
about
common
interests
at
all.
hyperbole,
however,
extravagant,
is
not
obscenity.
what
is
relevant
to
this
case
is
that
the
right
to
publish
honestly
held
views
or
opinions
in
classic
or
artistic
or
hyperbolic
form
is
protected
where
the
publication
particular
goes
to
a
special
audience
which
has
a
special
interest
in
the
subject
matter.
as
this
union
monthly
newsletter
went
only
to
the
members
of
the
union
who
were
intimately
concerned
with
the
union
status
of
each
of
the
non-members
because
it
affected
their
pocketbooks
immediately
for
one
thing.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
525,
420
of
whom
are
active
members
of
the
letter
carriers,
the
balance
being
retired
letter
carriers.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
absolutely.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
precisely
as
if
this
were
a
chemical
society
whose
members
are
all
chemists,
and
whose
publication
was
devoted
exclusively
to
the
interest
of
chemists,
it
would
have
no
less
protection
than
the
new
york
times.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
see
no
reason
why
the
new
york
times
rule
should
not
apply
for
the
publisher
of
that
publication,
none
whatsoever.
assuming
the
posture
that
you
put
into
your
question
that
the
matter
is
limited
to
matters
of
common
and
proper
interests
to
the
residents
of
the
apartment.
i’m
not
saying
that
everything
that
--
each
resident
of
the
apartment
may
do
in
his
own
privacy
of
his
home,
as
a
matter
of
legitimate
interest
was
negligent.
but,
if
what
he
does
affects
by
doing
of
it
the
lives
of
those
around
him,
he
doesn’t
take
his
garbage
and
drop
it
in
the
appropriate
garbage
disposal
place,
but
leaves
it
outside
for
somebody
else's
to
do
or
sneak
up
the
hall.
i
am
sure
that
this
is
a
matter
about
which
the
publication
might
legitimately
take
note.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
see
nothing
in
the
rationale
of
new
york
times
or
the
first
amendment
that
warrants
extension
to
that
case.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
think
that
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
the
press
have
a
quite
different
meaning
when
they
are
involved
in
matters
of
concern
to
more
than
two
disputants
of
the
two
individuals
who
may
be
considering
something,
yes.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
it
depends
of
what
he’s
talking
about,
what
the
interest
of
his
audience
is.
if
there
is
both
a
common
interest
in
the
subject
matter
and
relevancy
to
that
subject
matter
and
an
interest
of
the
speech
in
that
subject
matter,
and
if
the
subject
to
which
the
speech
is
addressed
as
somehow
been
involved
willingly
or
unwillingly,
but
necessarily
involved
under
the
filthy
or
in
the
controversy,
the
speaker
on
the
stomp
is
entitled
to
no
less
protection
than
the
publisher.
let’s
not
speak
to
the
publisher
of
the
new
york
times,
if
your
honor
please,
because
i
think
that’s
the
wrong
analogy.
let’s
talk
about
the
man
who
arrives
at
the
city
hall
meeting
and
calls
bresler
a
black
man.
he
is
the
person
whose
constitutional
rights
on
the
first
amendment
issue
are
the
equivalent
of
your
public
speaker
on
the
stomp.
we
have
a
different
case
here
because
we
have
a
labor
dispute
and
we
have
linn
and
we
have
federal
preemption
and
so
on,
so
this
is
an
easier
case.
but,
the
case
that
you
put
must
be
measured,
it
seems
to
me,
in
terms
of
the
outraged
citizen
of
greenbelt
who
thinks
that
black
--
bresler’s
tactics
are
black.
now,
i
want
to
turn
a
few
moments
that
are
left
to
what
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
did
with
this
case.
the
first
thing
it
did
with
this
case
was
to
throw
linn
out
of
the
window
on
the
ground
that
it
had
a
new
theory.
you
couldn’t
have
a
violation
of
virginia
statute
for
insulting
words
unless
you
also
came
up
with
common
law
malice.
the
answer
is
that
common
law
malice
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
linn.
that
was
reversed
in
favor
of
the
new
york
times
rule
which
was
adopted
by
analogy.
secondly,
the
court
got
rid
--
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
you’re
right.
it’s
used
very
often
daily.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
the
deputy
is
the
one
who
actually
makes
the
decision.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
assistant
secretary
of
labor.
he’s
especially
delegated.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
precisely,
they
should
probably
examine
these
reports
everyday.
they
come
across
my
desk
and
exactly
this
kind
of
problem.
incidentally,
it
is
--
were
it
argued
in
that
fashion,
we
would
vigorously
defend
and
unquestionably
win
on
the
ground
that
this
was
not
coercion
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
on
the
preemption
question,
there
is
absolutely
no
doubt
whatsoever.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
it
does
now,
but
it
didn’t
at
the
time
this
case
arose.
at
the
time
this
case
arose,
labor
management
relations
between
this
management
and
this
union
was
governed
under
the
executive
order
referred
to
which
had
the
enforcement
provisions
referred
to
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
in
those
days,
virtually
everyday
of
the
week,
complaints
were
made
about
labor
organizations
to
the
assistant
secretary
of
labor
about
coercion
of
employees
to
join
union.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes,
they
were
based
on
exactly
the
provisions
of
the
executive
order
which
incorporate
almost
in
hyperbole
the
terms
of
the
national
--
the
prohibitions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
by
virtue
of
the
executive
order,
that
is
your
question,
yes,
and
the
court
below
held
that
the
executive
order
following
decisions
on
matter
this
court
with
three
unanimous
circuits
held
that
the
executive
order
had
the
force
of
law
and,
therefore,
for
preemption
purposes
was
the
equivalent
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
the
postal
reorganization
act.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
which
has
changed
the
picture
and
brought
postal
labor
relations
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
by
explicit
provisions
under
the
terms
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
however,
the
situation
as
the
courts
below
conceded
was
identical
for
preemption
purposes
before,
unless
we
want
to
forget
what
preemption
is
all
about
which
is
avoidance
of
unseemly
conflict
between
federal
and
state
authority.
i
want
to
say
that
my
colleague,
mr.
kapral,
keeps
confusing
in
his
brief
taking
a
statement
literally
with
taking
a
statement
seriously.
of
course,
the
hyperbole
was
intended
to
be
taken
seriously.our
point
is
that
it
was
not
and
could
not
have
been
because
it
was
not
written
to
be
and
was
not
published
to
be
taken
literally.
it
was
an
expression
of
emotion
in
a
concept
of
feelings.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
that
that
linn
standard
was
satisfied?
well,
of
course,
they
are
completely
wrong
because
the
linn
standard
was
not
satisfied.
the
linn
standard
is
new
york
times
not
common
law
malice.
they
are
completely
wrong
about
that
and
they
are
completely
wrong
about
another
thing.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes,
sir.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
that
ends
it.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
they
are
wrong
exactly
the
same
way
and
for
exactly
the
same
reason
in
another
respect
when
they
sustained
the
virginia
statute
for
insulting
workmen
because
they
said
we
now
come
within
the
scope
of
what’s
constitutionally
immune,
that
is
constitutionally
not
protected.
when
we
say
that
if
these
words
are
spoken
with
common
law
malice,
there’s
no
over
breath
problem
and
no
vagueness
problem,
that
all
disappears.
they
are
just
flat
wrong.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
the
only
conceivable
difference
is
that
you
don’t
have
to
unless
you
wish
to
reach
my
special
audience:
argued,
my
public
issue,
argued.
if
this
is
a
labor
dispute
and
linn
applies,
you
don’t
have
to
go
where
i
go
in
brief.
when
i
urge
you
to
say
that
what
in
fact
has
happened
here
or
ought
to
be
happened
is
the
transmutation
of
a
better
common
law
rule
which
always
created
a
qualified
privilege
for
communication
to
those
interested
in
a
particular
subject
matter.
creation
of
that
common
--
elevation
of
that
common
law
privilege
to
constitutional
status
and
then
the
superimposition
upon
that
elevation
of
the
new
york
times
test
of
falsity,
intentional
or
willful,
for
the
old
common
law
falsity
test
--
not
fall
test,
not
a
falsity,
but
to
go
with.
thank
you.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
judgment
to
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
affirming
three
separate
judgments
of
$55,000
each,
a
nice
figure
of
$165,000
in
all,
against
the
richmond
branch
of
the
national
association
of
letter
carriers
and
the
parent
national
association.
the
three
plaintiffs,
beneficiaries
to
these
judgments,
are
individual
letter
carriers
who
refused
deliberately
and
willfully
to
join
the
union.
because
of
that
refusal,
they
were
identified
as
scabs
in
the
local
branch’s
monthly
newsletter
to
its
members
and,
in
one
issue,
the
branch
published
pejorative
definition
of
scab,
popularly
attributed
to
jack
london
followed
by
a
list
of
scabs
which
named
the
non-members,
some-15
of
them
including
the
three
plaintiffs.
at
least
since
1897,
according
the
century
dictionary
encyclopedia
which
is
quoted
at
page
51
of
the
appendix,
in
labor
parlance,
a
scab
is
workman
who
is
not
or
refuses
to
become
a
member
of
a
labor
union.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
that
definition
was
not
printed,
but
the
record
is
unequivocally
clear
that
all
of
the
plaintiffs
and
everyone
else
knew
that
the
reason
they
were
being
called
scabs
was
that
they
had
been
importuned
and
pleaded
with
and
begged
to
join
the
union
and
they
refused
willfully
and
deliberately
to
do
so.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes,
sir.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
no,
i
have
no
meaning,
no
implication
in
that
word
in
that
context
other
than
“they
were
not
newly
on
the
job
and
not
had
a
chance
not
be
approached,
had
not
had
the
chance
to
consider
the
problem.”
they
had
made
a
deliberate
choice
is
all
i
meant
to
say.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
beg
your
pardon.
i
will
change
it.
they
had
deliberately
elected
not
to
joint
the.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
i
was
coming
to
that.
i
mean
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
well,
i
don’t
suppose
that
the
dictionaries
go
on
and
print
jack
london’s
definition
as
being
part
of
the
commonly
accepted
definition
of
a
scab.
jack
london
was
elaborated
in
literary
fashion
about
what
is
conception
of
a
scab
was.
it’s
not
a
literary
dictionary
definition
of
a
scab.
it’s
an
artist’s
conception.
the
publication
itself
did
not.
in
fact,
the
publication
does,
page
52,
i
believe,
of
the
record
or
maybe
it’s
74.
in
any
event,
immediately
after
the
article
itself
appeared,
at
page
77,
appears
a
card
from
which
the
editor
of
the
local
paper
derived
the
text
of
the
article.
that
was
published
by
the
richmond
trades
industry
of
council
and
that,
defendant’s
exhibit
5,
clearly
shows
that
a
scab
by
jack
london,
well-known
author
of
call
of
the
wild,
sea
wolf,
etcetera.
when,
as
your
honors
will
see,
the
local
branch
in
response
to
a
question
by
plaintiff
austin,
saying
he
didn’t
know
what
a
scab
was,
published
the
london
definition.
it
said
that
“some
people
seem
to
be
in
a
quandary
as
to
what
a
scab
is,
we
offer
the
following.”
it
did
not
say
that
it
was
the
only
definition.
it
did
not
say
it
was
a
dictionary
definition.
it
said
that
it
was
a
definition
and,
a
definition
it
certainly
was,
consisting
of
a
well-known
literary
labor
classic
attributed
at
least,
or
if
not
written,
by
jack
london.
in
any
event
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes,
sir.
i
do
believe
that
the
century
dictionary
encyclopedia,
which
i
quoted
earlier,
dated
1897
describes
a
scab
as
“an
opprobrious
term
used
by
the
workmen
or
others
who
dislike
his
action.”
now,
i
assume
that
that
means
that
to
trade
unionists
those
who
refuse
to
join
are
low
and
contemptible
people.
the
record
here
reflects
that
both
the
president
of
the
local
union
and
the
vice
president
of
the
national
stated
their
reasons
for
believing
that
so-called
free
riders
who
take
the
advantage
of
union
representation
without
bearing
their
fair
share
of
the
cost
or
any
share
of
the
cost,
who
are
willing
to
profit
from
the
benefits
and
the
efforts
of
their
fellows
to
maintain
wages
and
working
conditions,
who
do
as
one
of
the
plaintiffs
here
did,
ziegengeist,
perform
services
off
the
clock
on
free
time,
gratis,
for
his
employer
are
in
fact
low
and
contemptible
people.
they
choose
to
undermine
the
conditions
for
which
workers
organized
and
they
fought
and
struggled.
that
is
their
opinion
of
them,
and
it
is
our
contention
that
both
the
national
relations
laws
and
the
first
amendment
guarantee
their
right
among
themselves
to
express
that
opinion
for
the
lawful
purpose
of
exerting
social
pressure
upon
the
non-members
to
join.
now,
we
think
that
that
proposition
is
supported
by
the
decisions
of
this
court.
the
questions
principally
presented
are
whether,
as
a
matter
of
federal
preemption,
a
state’s
jurisdiction
over
defamation
arising
out
of
labor
disputes
is
limited
to
knowing
or
reckless
misrepresentation
of
fact.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
your
honor,
i
take
it
that
there
is
no
line
that
can
be
drawn
constitutionally
between
the
vividness
of
the
hyperbole
which
can
be
protected
and
that
which
is
not.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
constitution
or
linn,
either
one,
distinguish
the
epithets
which
are
particularly
remarked
in
linn
as
falling
within
the
common
place
discussion,
and
one
of
the
labor
board
cases
which
specifically
says
that
this
london
definition
itself
is
protected
under
section
7
as
falling
without
the
area
of
protected
speech
in
labor
controversies,
whereas,
this
court
said
in
linn
itself,
“we
do
not
judge
by
the
normal
standards
of
gentleman
linn
polite
speech.”
in
labor
controversies,
the
court
has
pointed
out
that
the
labor
disputes
are
ordinarily
heated
affairs.
the
language
of
this
common
place
there
might
well
be
deemed
actionable
per
se
in
some
state
jurisdictions.
representation
campaigns
are
frequently
characterized
by
bitter
and
extreme
charges,
counter-charges,
unfounded
rumors,
vituperations,
personal
accusations,
misrepresentations
and
distortions.
both
labor
and
management
often
speak
bluntly
and
recklessly,
embellishing
their
respective
positions
within
precatory
language.
that
was
worked
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes,
sir?
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
this
arose
out
of
the
efforts
of
the
union
to
bring
into
membership
the
remaining
non-members
who
were
employed
in
the
postal
career
services.
to
answer
your
question
shortly
and
bluntly,
there
was
no
legal
proceeding
pending
before
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
no,
as
far
as
we
know.
there
was
a
dispute
between
the
members
of
the
union
and
the
non-members
which,
in
senn
versus
tile
layers
union
this
court
has
held
to
constitute
a
labor
dispute
and
which
section
29
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
explicitly
defines
as
a
labor
dispute,
and
which
angelos
against
cafeteria
workers
explicitly
holds
as
labor
dispute.
any
effort
by
a
union
to
induce
non-members
to
join
is
per
se
a
labor
dispute,
yes.
now,
in
that
context,
to
come
back
to
what
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes,
your
honor,
and
it’s
absolutely
true.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
it
is
precisely
that,
it
is
precisely
that
and
we
say
that
it
is
rhetorical
hyperbole
not
because
we
say
so,
but
because
under
the
teachings
of
greenbelt
against
bresler,
it
must
be
so-held
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
fact
and
that
the
lower
court’s
attempt
without
any
rationale
whatsoever,
the
district
court
i
mean,
attempt
without
rationale
whatsoever,
to
say
that
bresler
is
completely
different
from
this
case
is
simply
utterly
intemperate.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
thank
you.
[luncheon
recess]
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
should
like
to
refer
to
two
other
passages
of
linn
which
have
relevance,
at
least,
here.
one
is
that
the
labor
board
has
concluded
that
epithets
such
as
“scab,”
“unfair,”
and
“liar”
are
common
place
in
these
struggles.
i
might
add,
as
common
place
as
the
london
definition,
and
not
so
indefensible
as
to
remove
them
from
the
protection
of
section
7,
even
though
the
statements
are
erroneous
and
defame
one
of
the
parties
to
the
dispute,
it's
on
pages
60-61,
and
i
continue
having
skipped
a
sentence
on
page
61
to
the
following.
in
sum,
the
board
tolerates
intemperate,
abusive,
and
inaccurate
statements
made
by
the
union
during
attempts
to
organize
employees,
which
was
what
this
was.
it
does
not
interpret
the
act
as
giving
either
party
license
to
injure
the
other
intentionally
by
circulating
defamatory
or
insulting
material
known
to
be
false.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
your
honor,
i
--
to
me,
the
only
hand
that
counts
is
the
last
four
words,
“known
to
be
false,”
versus
the
common
law
test,
embodies
the
new
york
times
test,
and
lays
down
the
boundary
of
state
court
jurisdiction.
in
order
for
a
statement
to
be
known
to
be
false
it
must
be
factual,
because
if
it
is
not
factual,
as
judge
marriage
said
in
speaking
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
curtis
publishing
co.
against
birdsong
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
then
it
simply
is
not
subject
to
the
litmus
paper
test
of
truth
or
false
until
you
talk,
and
if
it’s
not
subject
to
the
litmus
paper
test
truth
or
false,
then
it
can’t
come
within
the
scope
of
state
court
jurisdiction
under
linn.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i’m
inclined
to
believe
they
would,
unless
opinions
were
matters
of
fact
which,
conceivably,
they
might
be.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
in
other
words,
i
might
have
an
opinion
of
your
honor
and
state
the
contrary,
one
falsely
and
maliciously,
and
that,
i
think,
might
be
actionable.
but
hyperbole,
hyperbole
certainly
falls
on
the
other
side
of
the
line,
and
that’s
the
point
i
really
want
to
make.
that
if
rhetorical
hyperbole,
which
is
what
the
london
statement
is,
is
protected
constitution
and
protected
on
the
phrase
that
i
read
in
linn,
then
the
protection
must
be
coextensive
with
the
artist’s
imagination
and
certainly
commensurate
with
the
depth
of
the
sentiment
or
the
emotion
in
this
case,
particularly
revolution
against
workers
who
refuse
to
join
their
fellows
in
the
union
which
the
artist
is
seeking
to
express.
actually,
the
images
of
the
revoked
--
that
are
revoked
by
the
london
literature
are
not
too
difficult
to
compare
with
the
image
invoked
and
whose
favorable,
who
can
say,
“by
those
people
who
called
bresler
a
blackmailer,”
which,
in
bresler,
this
court
held
enjoyed
constitutional
protection,
and
as
the
chief
justice
said
speaking
for
this
court
in
organization
for
better
austin
versus
keefe.
“as
long
as
the
means
of
circulating
such
statements,
and
by
such
statements
in
that
parenthetical
expression,
i
mean,
extravagant
rhetorical
hyperbole,
are
peaceful,
the
communication
need
not
meet
standards
of
acceptability.”
standards
of
acceptability
for
good
hyperbole
and
bad
hyperbole,
there
are
none,
and
i
suggest--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes,
your
honor.
as
it
happens,
austin
was
a
prior
restraint
case.
but,
what
is
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
understand
that
the
general
framework
of
austin
was
near
versus
minnesota
and
the
prior
restraint.
but,
what
is
said
there
about
the
first
amendment
and
about
the
reasons
for
knocking
down
the
rationale
of
the
illinois
court
which
said
that
what
it
was
doing
was
protecting
the
privacy
of
this
businessman
to
conduct
his
business
the
way
he
chose
to
do
legally,
and
as
the
laws
of
the
state
of
illinois
gave
him
the
right
to
conduct,
and
who
chose
and
elected
not
to
sign
the
contract
that
this
organization
placed
before
him
and
demanded
that
sign,
and
the
supreme
court
held
that
that
was
an
invasion
of
his
privacy
and
it
further
held
that
the
leafleting
was
not
protected
because
it
was
a
means
of
coercing
him
to
change
his
business
practices
rather
than
as
a
means
of
communicating
ideas.
the
striking
down
of
those
arguments
was
a
matter
of
the
philosophy
of
the
first
amendment
not
near
versus
minnesota
and
prior
restraint.
now,
in
one
place,
we
distinguish
this
case
most
seriously
from
the
case
that
preceded
it.
workmen
drawn
together
in
a
common
occupation
by
a
common
employer
worked
together
whether
they
liked
it
or
not,
they’re
in
a
common
community,
and
a
choice
to
bond
together
as
a
union
and
to
become
members
of
the
same
organization
and
participate
in
its
affairs
and
to
contribute
to
its
upkeep
and
to
abide
by
its
rules
and
by
its
laws
is
a
voluntary
choice
that
each
of
them
must
make
in
the
society
in
which
we
live.
i
take
the
liberty
from
quoting
from
this
court’s
decision
in
time
versus
hill,
385
us
38.
“exposure
of
the
self
to
others
in
varying
degrees
is
a
concomitant
of
life
in
a
civilized
community.
the
risk
of
this
exposure
is
an
essential
incident
of
life
in
a
society
which
places
a
primary
value
on
freedom
of
speech
and
of
press.”
and
so,
every
letter
carrier
exposes
himself
to
the
good
or
ill
will
of
his
fellows,
those
who
are
union
members
and
those
who
are
not,
and
when
he
makes
the
decision
or
when
he
makes
the
choice
to
join
them
in
their
union
or
not.
he
by
the
same
token,
makes
a
choice
of
securing
their
social
good
will
or
their
social
ill
will.
our
opponents,
indeed,
concede
that
the
union
has
a
right
to
publish
the
fact
of
their
scabness,
that
they
are
scabs,
and
by
publishing
it,
they
seek
to
induce
other
letter
carriers
to
exert
social
pressure
upon
them
to
join
the
union.
they
say
“but
they
don’t
have
the
right
to
do
it
by
extravagant
hyperbole.”
we
say,
they
do
because
the
first
amendment
protects
extravagant
hyperbole
if
it
protects
the
right
to
speak
about
common
interests
at
all.
hyperbole,
however,
extravagant,
is
not
obscenity.
what
is
relevant
to
this
case
is
that
the
right
to
publish
honestly
held
views
or
opinions
in
classic
or
artistic
or
hyperbolic
form
is
protected
where
the
publication
particular
goes
to
a
special
audience
which
has
a
special
interest
in
the
subject
matter.
as
this
union
monthly
newsletter
went
only
to
the
members
of
the
union
who
were
intimately
concerned
with
the
union
status
of
each
of
the
non-members
because
it
affected
their
pocketbooks
immediately
for
one
thing.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
525,
420
of
whom
are
active
members
of
the
letter
carriers,
the
balance
being
retired
letter
carriers.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
absolutely.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
precisely
as
if
this
were
a
chemical
society
whose
members
are
all
chemists,
and
whose
publication
was
devoted
exclusively
to
the
interest
of
chemists,
it
would
have
no
less
protection
than
the
new
york
times.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
see
no
reason
why
the
new
york
times
rule
should
not
apply
for
the
publisher
of
that
publication,
none
whatsoever.
assuming
the
posture
that
you
put
into
your
question
that
the
matter
is
limited
to
matters
of
common
and
proper
interests
to
the
residents
of
the
apartment.
i’m
not
saying
that
everything
that
--
each
resident
of
the
apartment
may
do
in
his
own
privacy
of
his
home,
as
a
matter
of
legitimate
interest
was
negligent.
but,
if
what
he
does
affects
by
doing
of
it
the
lives
of
those
around
him,
he
doesn’t
take
his
garbage
and
drop
it
in
the
appropriate
garbage
disposal
place,
but
leaves
it
outside
for
somebody
else's
to
do
or
sneak
up
the
hall.
i
am
sure
that
this
is
a
matter
about
which
the
publication
might
legitimately
take
note.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
see
nothing
in
the
rationale
of
new
york
times
or
the
first
amendment
that
warrants
extension
to
that
case.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
i
think
that
freedom
of
speech
and
freedom
of
the
press
have
a
quite
different
meaning
when
they
are
involved
in
matters
of
concern
to
more
than
two
disputants
of
the
two
individuals
who
may
be
considering
something,
yes.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
it
depends
of
what
he’s
talking
about,
what
the
interest
of
his
audience
is.
if
there
is
both
a
common
interest
in
the
subject
matter
and
relevancy
to
that
subject
matter
and
an
interest
of
the
speech
in
that
subject
matter,
and
if
the
subject
to
which
the
speech
is
addressed
as
somehow
been
involved
willingly
or
unwillingly,
but
necessarily
involved
under
the
filthy
or
in
the
controversy,
the
speaker
on
the
stomp
is
entitled
to
no
less
protection
than
the
publisher.
let’s
not
speak
to
the
publisher
of
the
new
york
times,
if
your
honor
please,
because
i
think
that’s
the
wrong
analogy.
let’s
talk
about
the
man
who
arrives
at
the
city
hall
meeting
and
calls
bresler
a
black
man.
he
is
the
person
whose
constitutional
rights
on
the
first
amendment
issue
are
the
equivalent
of
your
public
speaker
on
the
stomp.
we
have
a
different
case
here
because
we
have
a
labor
dispute
and
we
have
linn
and
we
have
federal
preemption
and
so
on,
so
this
is
an
easier
case.
but,
the
case
that
you
put
must
be
measured,
it
seems
to
me,
in
terms
of
the
outraged
citizen
of
greenbelt
who
thinks
that
black
--
bresler’s
tactics
are
black.
now,
i
want
to
turn
a
few
moments
that
are
left
to
what
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
did
with
this
case.
the
first
thing
it
did
with
this
case
was
to
throw
linn
out
of
the
window
on
the
ground
that
it
had
a
new
theory.
you
couldn’t
have
a
violation
of
virginia
statute
for
insulting
words
unless
you
also
came
up
with
common
law
malice.
the
answer
is
that
common
law
malice
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
linn.
that
was
reversed
in
favor
of
the
new
york
times
rule
which
was
adopted
by
analogy.
secondly,
the
court
got
rid
--
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
you’re
right.
it’s
used
very
often
daily.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
the
deputy
is
the
one
who
actually
makes
the
decision.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
assistant
secretary
of
labor.
he’s
especially
delegated.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
precisely,
they
should
probably
examine
these
reports
everyday.
they
come
across
my
desk
and
exactly
this
kind
of
problem.
incidentally,
it
is
--
were
it
argued
in
that
fashion,
we
would
vigorously
defend
and
unquestionably
win
on
the
ground
that
this
was
not
coercion
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
on
the
preemption
question,
there
is
absolutely
no
doubt
whatsoever.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
it
does
now,
but
it
didn’t
at
the
time
this
case
arose.
at
the
time
this
case
arose,
labor
management
relations
between
this
management
and
this
union
was
governed
under
the
executive
order
referred
to
which
had
the
enforcement
provisions
referred
to
by
mr.
justice
brennan.
in
those
days,
virtually
everyday
of
the
week,
complaints
were
made
about
labor
organizations
to
the
assistant
secretary
of
labor
about
coercion
of
employees
to
join
union.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes,
they
were
based
on
exactly
the
provisions
of
the
executive
order
which
incorporate
almost
in
hyperbole
the
terms
of
the
national
--
the
prohibitions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
by
virtue
of
the
executive
order,
that
is
your
question,
yes,
and
the
court
below
held
that
the
executive
order
following
decisions
on
matter
this
court
with
three
unanimous
circuits
held
that
the
executive
order
had
the
force
of
law
and,
therefore,
for
preemption
purposes
was
the
equivalent
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
the
postal
reorganization
act.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
which
has
changed
the
picture
and
brought
postal
labor
relations
--
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
by
explicit
provisions
under
the
terms
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
however,
the
situation
as
the
courts
below
conceded
was
identical
for
preemption
purposes
before,
unless
we
want
to
forget
what
preemption
is
all
about
which
is
avoidance
of
unseemly
conflict
between
federal
and
state
authority.
i
want
to
say
that
my
colleague,
mr.
kapral,
keeps
confusing
in
his
brief
taking
a
statement
literally
with
taking
a
statement
seriously.
of
course,
the
hyperbole
was
intended
to
be
taken
seriously.our
point
is
that
it
was
not
and
could
not
have
been
because
it
was
not
written
to
be
and
was
not
published
to
be
taken
literally.
it
was
an
expression
of
emotion
in
a
concept
of
feelings.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
that
that
linn
standard
was
satisfied?
well,
of
course,
they
are
completely
wrong
because
the
linn
standard
was
not
satisfied.
the
linn
standard
is
new
york
times
not
common
law
malice.
they
are
completely
wrong
about
that
and
they
are
completely
wrong
about
another
thing.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
yes,
sir.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
that
ends
it.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
they
are
wrong
exactly
the
same
way
and
for
exactly
the
same
reason
in
another
respect
when
they
sustained
the
virginia
statute
for
insulting
workmen
because
they
said
we
now
come
within
the
scope
of
what’s
constitutionally
immune,
that
is
constitutionally
not
protected.
when
we
say
that
if
these
words
are
spoken
with
common
law
malice,
there’s
no
over
breath
problem
and
no
vagueness
problem,
that
all
disappears.
they
are
just
flat
wrong.
mr.
mozart
g.
ratner
the
only
conceivable
difference
is
that
you
don’t
have
to
unless
you
wish
to
reach
my
special
audience:
argued,
my
public
issue,
argued.
if
this
is
a
labor
dispute
and
linn
applies,
you
don’t
have
to
go
where
i
go
in
brief.
when
i
urge
you
to
say
that
what
in
fact
has
happened
here
or
ought
to
be
happened
is
the
transmutation
of
a
better
common
law
rule
which
always
created
a
qualified
privilege
for
communication
to
those
interested
in
a
particular
subject
matter.
creation
of
that
common
--
elevation
of
that
common
law
privilege
to
constitutional
status
and
then
the
superimposition
upon
that
elevation
of
the
new
york
times
test
of
falsity,
intentional
or
willful,
for
the
old
common
law
falsity
test
--
not
fall
test,
not
a
falsity,
but
to
go
with.
thank
you.
