mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
members
of
the
honorable
court.
i
would
like
to
distinguish
a
few
matters
concerning
factual
situations.
it
must
be
kept
in
mind
that
all
three
of
the
appellees
involved
here
have
been
employed
in
the
richmond
postal
service
for
14,
13,
and
12
years
respectively.
during
this
time,
they
elected
not
to
become
affiliated
with
the
union,
a
right
that
they
certainly
had
under
executive
order
11491
in
the
virginia
right
to
work
law.
now,
on
two
occasions
preceding
the
libelous
publication
in
question,
the
name
of
mr.
austin
was
printed
on
the
local
branch
newsletter
under
the
heading
of
the
list
of
scabs
at
the
time
the
actual
so
called
jack
london
definition
was
not
in
there,
just
the
names
under
list
of
scabs.
mr.
austin
didn’t
like
this
at
all,
and
he,
first
of
all,
went
to
the
richmond
postmaster
of
the
richmond
post
office
stating
that
he
thought
that
management
should
be
advised
that
coercive
tactics
were
being
used
on
persons
trying
to
get
them
to
join
the
union.
nothing
was
done
so
he
then
went
to
the
local
union
president
of
the
local
union.
at
that
time,
he
received
a
response
that
there
is
nothing
the
local
union
could
do
about
it,
absolutely
nothing.
this
was
a
tool
used
by
the
union
to
attempt
to
get
persons
to
join
the
union,
and
the
only
thing
he
could
do
would
be
to
join
the
union.
now,
at
this
time,
i
would
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
calling
of
the
appellees
as
scabs
is
not
the
subject
of
the
suit
involved
here.
but,
rather,
what
we
are
concerned
with
is
the
fact
that
these
three
gentlemen
were
held
up
to
ridicule
with
their
fellow
employees
by
attributing
to
each
one
of
them
lack
of
character,
rotten
principles,
and
being
traitors
to
god,
country,
family,
and
class.
a
union
would
contend
that
certainly
this
was
mere
hyperbole
that
no
one
would
take
the
same
seriously,
but
the
fact
remains
that
at
the
trial,
secretary
angelo
parker
of
the
union
testified
that
he
felt
the
appellees’
principle
should
be
questioned,
in
fact,
he
felt
they
had
rotten
principles.
the
president
of
the
local
union
testified
that
this
was
done
for
one
reason
and
one
reason
alone,
so
that
fellow
employees
would
stop
associating
with
these
three
persons.
i
think
an
interesting
point
in
clarifying
the
situation
that
we
are
dealing
with
here
today
is
being
one
of
first
instance,
was
brought
forth
by
mr.
kenneth
fiester,
president
of
the
international
labor
press
association
where,
on
the
witness
stand,
he
testified
that
he
has
been
involved
in
the
labor
movement
for
some
30
years
and
that
during
these
30
years
he
had
seen
this
article
printed
numerous
times.
in
fact,
so
many
numerous
times
that
he
couldn’t
even
begin
to
try
to
count
how
many
times.
yet,
under
cross-examination,
he
admitted
that
in
the
entire
30
some
year
period
he
had
never
actually
seen
this
article
appear
listing
certain
person’s
names,
named
as
individuals
as
here.
all
three
of
the
appellees
stated
that
they
had
all
experienced
for
a
very,
very
long
time
a
good
relationship
with
fellow
workers
and
up
until
the
time
this
article
appeared.
what
we
have
here,
i
feel
the
main
problem
involved
here
is
whether
what
was
done
was
printing
this
publication
of
concerning
the
appellees
whether
this
falls
within
the
doctrine
of
new
york
times
or
sullivan.
of
course,
we
propose
at
this
time
that
it
does
not.
this
court
in
curtis
publishing
co.
versus
butts
extended
the
knowing
falsity
or
reckless
disregard
of
truth
or
false
rule
to
include
public
figures.
in
1970,
this
honorable
court
in
the
rosenbloom
case
extended
this
rule
to
include
a
private
individual
with
the
statements
involved
and
in
issue
of
involvement
over
a
matter
of
general
or
public
concern.
now,
at
this
time,
i
must
say
it
is
hard
to
imagine
where
any
public
concern
or
public
issue
could
be
involved
here.
what
--
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
a
preemption
question,
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
well,
there
is
a
question.
there
has
been
a
question.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
yes,
your
honor,
i’m
prepared
to
deal
with
that.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
it’s
linn
versus
plant
guard
workers,
that’s
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
well,
your
honor,
the
linn
case,
of
course,
dealt
with
the
extent
to
which
--
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
that’s
correct,
but
linn
dealt
to
what
extent
the
new
york
--
to
what
extent
the
states
are
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
the
libel
--
to
suit
for
libel
involving
a
labor
dispute.
of
course
i,
at
this
time,
say
there
wasn’t.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
i
would
respectfully
dispute
it,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
in
some
respects,
it
was.
i
feel
that
the
linn
--
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
the
court
--
your
honor,
the
court
stated
in
linn
that
in
matters
of
merely
peripheral
concern
such
as
the
fact
of
the
case
indicated
here
that
in
a
situation
like
that
the
states
had
jurisdiction.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
of
course,
there,
we
get
into
the
situation
--
of
course,
the
court
said
in
the
linn
case
that
the
new
york
times
rule
was
adopted
by
--
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
analogy.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
and
it
gets
down
to
the
situation
what
does
the
term
“analogy”
actually
mean.
does
it
mean
comparable
principles
or
does
it
mean
by
constitutional
compulsion?
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
my
position,
your
honor,
is
that
in
the
linn
case
the
court
meant
the
--
supreme
court
of
virginia
stated
that
in
the
linn
case
the
states
were
not
--
of
course,
this
court
stated
--
excuse
me,
the
states
are
not
preempted
by
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
i
would
go
to
say
it’s
not
a
labor
dispute.
i
say
the
fact
that
three
individuals
chose
a
private
right
not
to
join
the
union,
a
right
that
they
have,
is
certainly
not,
i
don’t
see
where
it’s
a
labor
dispute.
there’s
no
question
of
wages
and
hours
involved,
no
question
of
working
conditions,
no
picketing.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
well,
your
honor,
there
again
the
appellants
--
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
if
you
would
term
hyperbolic
--
as
they
would
say,
this
is
mere
hyperbolic
venting
of
emotions,
so
therefore,
it
didn’t
come
into
--
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
i
say,
your
honor,
it’s
questionable
whether
really
the
--
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
i
realize
that.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
i
think
it’s
a
question
whether
there
is
a
labor
dispute
or
not,
yes.
i
would
say
at
the
time
that
it
is
not
a
labor
dispute.
the
fact
bear
out
it
is
a
labor
dispute.
three
unknown
individuals,
relatively
unknown
individuals,
choose
privately
not
to
become
affiliated
with
the
union.
now,
the
right
--
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
well,
the
national
labor
relations
act,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
federal
law.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
was
their
holding.
there
was
actual
malice
here.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
i
wasn’t,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
pardon?
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
i
do.
yes,
i
do.
i
certainly
have
drawn
the
virginia
view.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
yes,
and
malice
was
shown.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
well,
your
honor,
of
course
the
linn
case
was
more
of
a
classic
example
of
a
labor
dispute,
there
was
labor
and
management
being
involved
and
not
only
that,
mr.
linn
of
course
was
the
head
of
a
large
national
detective
agency.
i
think
he
fell
into
the
question
of
a
public
figure
certainly
more
than
three
appellees
do
in
our
case.
your
honor,
of
course,
the
union
had
a
privilege,
a
qualified
privilege.
the
right
to
let
fellow
members
be
advised
that
these
three
persons
were
not
members
of
the
union.
nobody
doubts
that
fact,
but
it
could’ve
been
done
in
a
much
more
diplomatic
way,
a
way
to
inform
and
not
to
injure.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
well,
maybe
not
diplomatic
but
--
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
in
a
non-libelous
way.
what
they
would
say,
chief
justice
burger,
is
that
what
you
cannot
do
directly,
you
can
do
indirectly.
in
other
words,
by
couching
expressions
in
terms
and
hyperbolic
fashion,
you
can
escape
the
conscription
of
libel.
this
is
what
they’re
saying
and
i
say,
of
course,
this
is
not
right.
in
using
this
article,
of
course,
in
the
way
--
for
the
purpose
that
the
union
used
it,
it
proves
the
qualified
privilege
that
was
given
to
them,
the
privilege
that
lets
the
union
members
know
that
--
who
are
not
union
members
and,
therefore,
they
are
--
the
union
is
liable
to
the
appellees
for
doing
so.
aside
from
being
an
effort,
of
course,
of
the
union
to
compel
appellees
to
join
the
union,
no
labor
dispute
was
involved.
everybody
in
the
richmond
post
office
except
the
handful
of
carriers
at
the
richmond
post
office
were
already
members
of
the
union.
there’s
no
violence
here
in
any
place
shown,
no
picketing,
no
publicity,
in
what
way
possibly
could
the
public
have
any
interest
in
whether
or
not
these
three
individuals
used
their
right
to
join
the
union
or
not,
exercise
that
right.
i
feel
that
this
case
can
be,
again,
can
be
distinguished
from
the
rosenbloom
case
and
as
much
as
in
that
case,
of
course,
it
was
a
circulation
intended
to
reach
the
general
public.
here,
we’re
just
attempting
to
reach
a
specific
group,
namely
the
union
members
and,
in
that
case,
of
course
we
had
criminal
conduct
involved.
we
had
obscenity
involved.
certainly,
these
are
factors
that
the
general
public
would
be
interested
in,
no
doubt
about
it.
but,
i
say
in
this
case,
absolutely
no
way
that
i
--
possibly
a
person
could
say,
stretching
rosenbloom
way
out
of
proportion,
that
these
persons
came
under
the
realm
of
rosenbloom.
of
course,
all
the
appellants,
mr.
jack
london's
article,
it
was
introduced
into
evidence,
and
no
where
does
this
jack
london
article
name
appellees.
i
mean,
the
article
is
printed
but
no
where
underneath
it
is
anyone’s
name
listed
and,
as
i
said
earlier,
this
was
brought
out
at
the
trial
that
never
in
a
37-year
following
the
labor
movement
in
this
country
had
this
person
ever
since
this
before.
the
main
reason
we
propose
at
this
time
that
this
article
was
written
for
one
reason
alone,
to
exert
pressure
on
these
individuals
to
join
the
union
and
to
exert
so
that
fellow
workers
would
austersize
them
and
no
longer
associate
with
these
persons.
we
get
into
the
question
of
whether
freedom
of
speech
in
the
press
permits
a
publication
of
this
type
of
a
libelous
article.
in
the
case
of
chaplinsky
versus
new
hampshire,
this
court
stated
“that
it
is
well
understood
that
the
right
of
free
speech
is
not
absolute
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances.
there
are
certain
well-defined
and
narrowly
limited
classes
of
speech.
the
prevention
and
punishment
of
which
have
never
been
thought
to
raise
any
constitutional
problem.”
now,
of
course,
no
violence
was
present
in
this
case,
very
true
but
mr.
austin,
one
of
the
appellants,
stated
that
on
one
occasion
he
was
confronted
by
the
union
steward
and
he
was
able
to
restrain
himself
from
committing
an
assault
upon
this
person
and
that
the
article
on
many
occasions
provoked
him
to
the
point
where
he
considered
committing
assault
on
purpose.
gentlemen,
i
thank
you.
and,
at
this
time,
my
colleague
mr.
cherry
will
continue
the
argument.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
mr.
chief
justice
burger
and
members
of
the
honorable
court.
i
would
like
to
distinguish
a
few
matters
concerning
factual
situations.
it
must
be
kept
in

that
all
three
of
the
appellees
involved
here
have
been
employed
in
the
richmond
postal
service
for
14,
13,
and
12
years
respectively.
during
this
time,
they
elected
not
to
become

with
the
union,
a
right
that
they
certainly
had
under
executive
order
11491
in
the
virginia
right

now,
on
two
occasions
preceding
the
libelous
publication
in
question,
the
name
of
mr.
austin
was
printed
on
the
local
branch
newsletter
under
the
heading
of
the
list
of
scabs
at
the
time
the
actual
so
called

not.
this
court
in
curtis
publishing
co.
versus
butts
extended
the
knowing
falsity
or
reckless
disregard
of
truth
or
false
rule
to
include
public
figures.
in
1970,
this
honorable
court
in
the
rosenbloom
case
extended
this
rule
to
include
a
private
individual
with
the
statements
involved
and
in
issue
of
involvement
over
a
matter
of
general
or
public
concern.
now,
at
this
time,
i
must
say
it
is
hard
to
imagine
where
any
public
concern
or
public
issue
could
be
involved
here.
what
--
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
a
preemption
question,
your
honor?
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
well,
there
is
a
question.
there
has
been
a
question.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
yes,
your
honor,
i’m
prepared
to
deal
with
that.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
it’s
linn
versus
plant
guard
workers,
that’s
correct.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
well,
your
honor,
the
linn
case,
of
course,
dealt
with
the
extent
to
which
--
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
that’s
correct,
but
linn
dealt
to
what
extent
the
new
york
--
to
what
extent
the
states
are
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
the
libel
--
to
suit
for
libel
involving
a
labor
dispute.
of
course
i,
at
this
time,
say
there
wasn’t.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
i
would
respectfully
dispute
it,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
in
some
respects,
it
was.
i
feel
that
the
linn
--
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
the
court
--
your
honor,
the
court
stated
in
linn
that
in
matters
of
merely
peripheral
concern
such
as
the
fact
of
the
case
indicated
here
that
in
a
situation
like
that
the
states
had
jurisdiction.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
of
course,
there,
we
get
into
the
situation
--
of
course,
the
court
said
in
the
linn
case
that
the
new
york
times
rule
was
adopted
by
--
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
analogy.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
and
it
gets
down
to
the
situation
what
does
the
term
“analogy”
actually
mean.
does
it
mean
comparable
principles
or
does
it
mean
by
constitutional
compulsion?
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
my
position,
your
honor,
is
that
in
the
linn
case
the
court
meant
the
--
supreme
court
of
virginia
stated
that
in
the
linn
case
the
states
were
not
--
of
course,
this
court
stated
--
excuse
me,
the
states
are
not
preempted
by
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
i
would
go
to
say
it’s
not
a
labor
dispute.
i
say
the
fact
that
three
individuals
chose
a
private
right
not
to
join
the
union,
a
right
that
they
have,
is
certainly
not,
i
don’t
see
where
it’s
a
labor
dispute.
there’s
no
question
of
wages
and
hours
involved,
no
question
of
working
conditions,
no
picketing.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
well,
your
honor,
there
again
the
appellants
--
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
if
you
would
term
hyperbolic
--
as
they
would
say,
this
is
mere
hyperbolic
venting
of
emotions,
so
therefore,
it
didn’t
come
into
--
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
i
say,
your
honor,
it’s
questionable
whether
really
the
--
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
i
realize
that.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
i
think
it’s
a
question
whether
there
is
a
labor
dispute
or
not,
yes.
i
would
say
at
the
time
that
it
is
not
a
labor
dispute.
the
fact
bear
out
it
is
a
labor
dispute.
three
unknown
individuals,
relatively
unknown
individuals,
choose
privately
not
to
become
affiliated
with
the
union.
now,
the
right
--
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
well,
the
national
labor
relations
act,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
federal
law.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
was
their
holding.
there
was
actual
malice
here.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
i
wasn’t,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
pardon?
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
i
do.
yes,
i
do.
i
certainly
have
drawn
the
virginia
view.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
yes,
and
malice
was
shown.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
well,
your
honor,
of
course
the
linn
case
was
more
of
a
classic
example
of
a
labor
dispute,
there
was
labor
and
management
being
involved
and
not
only
that,
mr.
linn
of
course
was
the
head
of
a
large
national
detective
agency.
i
think
he
fell
into
the
question
of
a
public
figure
certainly
more
than
three
appellees
do
in
our
case.
your
honor,
of
course,
the
union
had
a
privilege,
a
qualified
privilege.
the
right
to
let
fellow
members
be
advised
that
these
three
persons
were
not
members
of
the
union.
nobody
doubts
that
fact,
but
it
could’ve
been
done
in
a
much
more
diplomatic
way,
a
way
to
inform
and
not
to
injure.
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
well,
maybe
not
diplomatic
but
--
mr.
stephen
m.
kapral
in
a
non-libelous
way.
what
they
would
say,
chief
justice
burger,
is
that
what
you
cannot
do
directly,
you
can
do
indirectly.
in
other
words,
by
couching
expressions
in
terms
and
hyperbolic
fashion,
you
can
escape
the
conscription
of
libel.
this
is
what
they’re
saying
and
i
say,
of
course,
this
is
not
right.
in
using
this
article,
of
course,
in
the
way
--
for
the
purpose
that
the
union
used
it,
it
proves
the
qualified
privilege
that
was
given
to
them,
the
privilege
that
lets
the
union
members
know
that
--
who
are
not
union
members
and,
therefore,
they
are
--
the
union
is
liable
to
the
appellees
for
doing
so.
aside
from
being
an
effort,
of
course,
of
the
union
to
compel
appellees
to
join
the
union,
no
labor
dispute
was
involved.
everybody
in
the
richmond
post
office
except
the
handful
of
carriers
at
the
richmond
post
office
were
already
members
of
the
union.
there’s
no
violence
here
in
any
place
shown,
no
picketing,
no
publicity,
in
what
way
possibly
could
the
public
have
any
interest
in
whether
or
not
these
three
individuals
used
their
right
to
join
the
union
or
not,
exercise
that
right.
i
feel
that
this
case
can
be,
again,
can
be
distinguished
from
the
rosenbloom
case
and
as
much
as
in
that
case,
of
course,
it
was
a
circulation
intended
to
reach
the
general
public.
here,
we’re
just
attempting
to
reach
a
specific
group,
namely
the
union
members
and,
in
that
case,
of
course
we
had
criminal
conduct
involved.
we
had
obscenity
involved.
certainly,
these
are
factors
that
the
general
public
would
be
interested
in,
no
doubt
about
it.
but,
i
say
in
this
case,
absolutely
no
way
that
i
--
possibly
a
person
could
say,
stretching
rosenbloom
way
out
of
proportion,
that
these
persons
came
under
the
realm
of
rosenbloom.
of
course,
all
the
appellants,
mr.
jack
london's
article,
it
was
introduced
into
evidence,
and
no
where
does
this
jack
london
article
name
appellees.
i
mean,
the
article
is
printed
but
no
where
underneath
it
is
anyone’s
name
listed
and,
as
i
said
earlier,
this
was
brought
out
at
the
trial
that
never
in
a
37-year
following
the
labor
movement
in
this
country
had
this
person
ever
since
this
before.
the
main
reason
we
propose
at
this
time
that
this
article
was
written
for
one
reason
alone,
to
exert
pressure
on
these
individuals
to
join
the
union
and
to
exert
so
that
fellow
workers
would
austersize
them
and
no
longer
associate
with
these
persons.
we
get
into
the
question
of
whether
freedom
of
speech
in
the
press
permits
a
publication
of
this
type
of
a
libelous
article.
in
the
case
of
chaplinsky
versus
new
hampshire,
this
court
stated
“that
it
is
well
understood
that
the
right
of
free
speech
is
not
absolute
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances.
there
are
certain
well-defined
and
narrowly
limited
classes
of
speech.
the
prevention
and
punishment
of
which
have
never
been
thought
to
raise
any
constitutional
problem.”
now,
of
course,
no
violence
was
present
in
this
case,
very
true
but
mr.
austin,
one
of
the
appellants,
stated
that
on
one
occasion
he
was
confronted
by
the
union
steward
and
he
was
able
to
restrain
himself
from
committing
an
assault
upon
this
person
and
that
the
article
on
many
occasions
provoked
him
to
the
point
where
he
considered
committing
assault
on
purpose.
gentlemen,
i
thank
you.
and,
at
this
time,
my
colleague
mr.
cherry
will
continue
the
argument.
