justice
thurgood
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
judge
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
upholding
liable
judgments
in
damages
against
the
appellants,
the
national
association
of
letter
carriers
and
its
richmond
local.
the
local
was
recognized
as
exclusive
bargaining
representative
of
postal
workers
in
richmond
under
the
provisions
of
executive
order
11491,
governing
labor
relations
and
federal
employment.
although
a
majority
of
the
letter
carriers
in
richmond
were
members
of
that
union,
the
union
was
engaged
in
an
effort
to
organize
the
remainder.
as
a
part
of
that
effort,
the
union
published,
in
its
monthly
newsletter,
a
list
of
scabs,
as
it
was
called,
i.e.,
a
list
of
those
who
had
not
yet
joined
the
union.
and
accompanied
this
was
the
majority
of
application
of
scab
which
is
generally
attributed
to
jack
london.
the
appellees,
who
are
three
postal
workers,
whose
names
were
included
in
the
list
of
scabs,
brought
this
liable
action
and
each
recovered
$10,000
compensatory
damages
and
$45,000
punitive
damages.
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
affirmed.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia.
in
an
opinion
today
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
this
case
is
governed
by
this
court’s
1966
opinion
in
linn
versus
plant
guard
workers,
where
this
court
held
that
the
application
of
the
state
liable
laws
and
labor
disputes
was
preempted
by
the
federal
labor
laws
unless
the
liable
statements
were
made
with
knowledge
of
their
false
appeal
with
reckless
disregard
from
the
truth.
although
this
case
involves
executive
order
11491
rather
than
the
national
labor
relations
act
involved
in
linn,
we
think
that
this
same
standard
adopted
by
analogy
from
our
decision
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan
should
govern
here.
we
also
hold
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
there
was
a
labor
dispute
within
the
meaning
of
the
linn
decision
or
the
union’s
organizing
activity
here,
throughout
the
recognition
of
the
union,
was
still
entitled
to
the
protection
of
federal
labor
law.
applying
the
new
york
times
standard,
we
find
that
the
liable
judgments
here
cannot
stand.
the
newsletter’s
application
of
the
list
of
scabs
cannot
be
actionable,
because
the
use
of
the
use
of
the
word
‘scab’
which
is
literally
and
factually
accurate,
and
federal
labor
law
permits
the
use
of
epithets
of
this
kind.
similarly,
jack
london’s
definition
of
the
scab
cannot
be
the
basis
for
liable
judgment,
because
we
do
not
believe
that
it
conveyed
any
false
representation
of
fact,
but
rather
the
union’s
strong
disagreement
with
those
who
refuse
to
join
the
union.
mr.
justice
douglas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
result.
mr.
justice
powell
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
join.
