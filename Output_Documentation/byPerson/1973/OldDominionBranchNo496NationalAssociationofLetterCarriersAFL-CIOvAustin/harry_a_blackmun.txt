mr.
ratner,
that’s
twice
you’ve
used
the
word
“willfully.”
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
normally,
this
connotes
guilt.
are
you
using
that
in
that
frame
of
reference?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
think
that
is
not
the
correct
use
of
the
word
“willfully.”
i
just
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
federal
law?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
is
the
explanation
you’ve
just
given
us
about
linn,
the
one
that
the
virginia
court
adopted
or
did
they
say
linn
wasn’t
applicable
because
there’s
malice
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
you’re
not
trying
to
explain
linn
away
on
that
basis?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
cherry,
would
you
say
the
same
thing
about
the
american
medical
association
journal
as
not
being
of
any
public
interest
to
the
public
general
generally,
or
the
aba
journal?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
mr.
ratner,
let
me
interrupt
you
too.
i
think
this
bears
on
what
you
just
said
and
maybe
you’ve
answered
it,
but
i
didn’t
quite
sense
that
you
did.
if
linn
applies,
is
there
a
greater
and
more
stringent
test
under
linn
and
under
the
first
amendment?
