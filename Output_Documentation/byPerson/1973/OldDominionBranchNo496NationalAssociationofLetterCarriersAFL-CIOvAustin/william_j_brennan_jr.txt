william
j.
brennan,

mr.
ratner,
i
take
it
that
as
far
as
the
use
of
the
word
“scab”
is
concerned,
it
certainly
is
a
true
appellation
here,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
any
definition
of
the
term,
and
it’s
your
position,
is
it,
that
the
rest
of
the
material
in
this
publication
has
just
rhetorical
hyperboles?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
law
does
the
determination
whether
it’s
a
labor
dispute
turn
on,
the
federal
or
state
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let’s
see.
that
would
be
a
position
then
and
if
you’re
wrong
on
the
issue
of
labor
dispute
and
linn
does
apply,
then
you’re
alternative
ground
is
taken
by
the
virginia
court,
namely
that
linn
was
satisfied?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
i
understood
your
colleague
to
say
differently
in
answer
to
my
question
or
at
least
i
think
so.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
excuse
me,
mr.
cherry.
i
notice
in
appendix
b
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
is
executive
order
11491
at
page
17a
and
provides
for
a
federal
relations
council
and
then
provides
that
“the
assistant
secretary
of
labor
for
labor
management
relations
shall
except
as
provided
in
the
section
19
(d)
of
this
order
decide
complaints
of
alleged
unfair
labor
practices
and
alleged
violations
of
the
standards
of
conduct
for
labor
organization”
and
19
(d)
apparently
has
reference
to
that
exception
covers
grievance
procedures
and
so
forth
in
lieu
of.
so,
apparently,
the
executive
order
does
set
up
a
mechanism
whether
the
termination
of
complaints
of
unfair
labor
practice
is
comparable
to
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
the
national
labor
relations
board
does,
doesn’t
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
ever
heard
this
being
used?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
you
are
and
your
colleague
seem
to
be
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
ratner,
is
this
procedure
used
very
often?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
what
--
is
it
an
assistant
secretary
of
labor?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
deputy,
what?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
whether
the
formality
is
comparable
to
what
goes
on
before
the
board?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
apart
from
that,
on
the
preemption
question.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
now
brings
these
relations
under
the
national
labor
relations
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
of
the
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
by
explicit
provisions?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
tell
me,
mr.
ratner,
if
the
opinion
of
the
virginia
supreme
court
was
to
be
read
as
same,
yes,
there
is
a
preemption,
but
the
linn
standard
was
satisfied.
what’s
your
answer
about
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
wait
a
minute.
don’t
[attempt
to
laughter]
rush
so
fast.
what
they
--
apparently,
what
you’re
suggesting
they
held
was,
erroneously,
that
common
law
malice
satisfied
the
linn
standard.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
when,
in
fact,
what
this
court
held
was
that
only
new

time
malice
was
satisfied.
is
that
it?

william

alright.
