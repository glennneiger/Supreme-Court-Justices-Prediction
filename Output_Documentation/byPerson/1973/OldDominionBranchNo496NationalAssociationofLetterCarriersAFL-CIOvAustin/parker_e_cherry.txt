mr.
parker
e.
cherry
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
the
court
please.
this
court
in
the
linn
case
afforded
workers
a
measure
of
protection
against
malicious
libel
for
causing
them
harm.
when
the
workers
were
given
that
measure
for
protection,
the
new
york
times
rule
had
already
been
promulgated
and
was
held
not
constitutionally
applicable.
today,
we
are
viewing
the
measure
of
protection
afforded
to
non-union
workers
in
the
light
of
the
progeny
of
new
york
times
as
curtis
publishing
co.
and
rosenbloom
versus
metromedia.
the
majority
opinion
in
rosenbloom
left
open
to
future
determination
the
extent
of
a
private
person’s
involvement
in
matters
of
public
interest.
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
his
dissent
in
rosenbloom
with
which
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
harlan
concurred,
pointed
out
that
two
essential
and
fundamental
values
conflict,
that
is
the
right
of
an
obscure
and
anonymous
person
for
protection
from
unjustified
insult
and
wrongful
hurt
which
he
states
reflects
no
more
than
our
basic
concept
of
the
essential
dignity
and
work
of
every
human
being.
on
the
other
hand,
the
concept
of
a
citizen
informed
by
a
free
and
unfettered
press
with
this
conflict,
a
fundamental
right,
it
is
necessary
for
the
court
to
determine
which
of
the
fundamental
rights
is
a
more
compelling
and
paramount.
this
conflict
must
be
viewed
and
result
in
the
light
of
the
particular
circumstances
under
which
the
conflict
arose.
in
considering
the
rights
of
a
private
and
anonymous
citizen
giving
way
by
reason
of
his
being
involved
in
a
matter
of
general
public
interest,
the
right
of
a
public
to
be
informed
by
free
and
unfettered
press,
i
make
the
point
that
there
is
a
basic
difference
between
a
labor
union
and
public
media.
and
particularly
so
in
the
relationship
between
a
labor
union
and
a
non-union
worker
in
a
plant
or
organization
in
which
a
union
is
bargaining
agent.
union,
first,
is
not
concerned
with
informing
the
public
of
the
general
public,
but
is
concerned
with
promoting
its
own
particular
interests,
which
interests
are
in
direct
conflict
with
the
interest
of
a
non-union
worker.
the
union
newsletter
which
has
just
been
mentioned
was
circulated
only
to
union
members
and
not
to
the
general
public.
on
the
hand,
the
media’s
only
interest
is
in
informing
the
public
on
a
matter
which
is
of
general
or
public
interest.
it
is
without
bias
in
the
matter
and
this
was
not
true
in
the
case
of
the
union.
when
we
consider
that
this
background,
the
right
of
the
individual
of
non-union
worker
under
the
circumstances
here
of
merely
failing
or
refusing
to
join
union
as
against
the
right
of
the
general
public
to
know
even
if
this
could
be
considered
a
matter
of
general
public
interest.
the
compelling
and
paramount
interest,
we
assert,
is
clearly
that
of
the
non-union
worker.
if
union
had
this
right,
it
would
have
within
its
power,
by
publishing
in
its
newsletter,
to
make
anything
a
matter
of
public
interest,
then
that
has
the
bias.
the
organization
that
has
the
bias
would
have
the
right
of
making
it
a
matter
of
public
interest.
this
matter
that
we’re
talking
about
here
had
never
been
in
the
press,
it
had
never
been
discussed
anywhere.
it
was
strictly
between
union
and
these
particular
non-union
workers.
under
the
protection
of
the
new
york
times
rule,
a
standard
most
difficult
and
almost
impossible
of
proof
by
the
aggrieved
person,
union
would
be
able
to
harass
and
coerce
non-union
workers,
the
rights
of
non-union
workers
not
to
join
union
under
various
state
right
to
work
laws
and
in
the
instant
case,
under
the
executive
order
as
well,
would
be
largely
nullified.
now,
the
executive
order
does
say
specifically
that
the
union
cannot,
has
no
right
to
coerce
non-union
members
into
joining.
so
that
when
mr.
austin
went
to
the
postmaster
general
and
went
to
the
president
of
that
union
to
complain,
he
was
well
within
his
rights
to
say
they
are
attempting
to
coerce
me
and
they
themselves,
as
i
took
it
from
what
mr.
ratner
said
here
today,
for
practical
purposes
mentioned,
they
were
attempting
to
coerce
him,
at
least
the
tactics,
as
i
construe
them,
would
mean
that.
in
the
case
before
us,
the
president
of
the
union
admitted
that
this
publication
was
one
of
the
tools
used
by
union
to
compel
non-union
members
to
join.
unions
are,
today,
wealthy,
monolithic
organizations
with
almost
unlimited
resources
as
opposed
to
a
few
non-union
workers
in
a
particular
plant.
armed
with
virtual
immunity
under
new
york
times
rule,
the
union
would
have
within
its
power
the
means,
if
it
so
chose
and
as
it
did
here
--
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
yes,
sir,
it
violates
that.
it
violates
the
--
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
it
does
violate
that,
but
the
right
to
union
in
here
is
under
the
executive
order.
now,
that’s
what
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
says
that
it
was
under
that
that
they
are
permitted
to
--
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
yes,
i
don’t
think
--
i
think,
yes,
i
have
to
say
that
that’s
what
they
said.
they
have
the
right
to
--
the
national
labor
relations
act
says
they
have
no
right
to
coerce,
but
again,
that
is
on
the
periphery
concern
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
i
do
not
believe
so.
no,
sir.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
no
jurisdiction
was
ever
exercised.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
no,
i’m
not
--
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
that’s
right,
but
not
within
the
form
that
we’re
dealing
with
matters
between
the
employer
and
the
union
and
whatnot.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
yes,
sir.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
well,
the
executive
order
does
say
that
they
shall
not
coerce
workers.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
i
believe
the
--
because
there
is
in
that
provision
that
the
postmaster
general
in
the
area
has
the
obligation
of
seeing
that
that
is
imposed.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
yes,
sir.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
yes,
i
think
so.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
i
say
that
--
you
mean
as
to
the
new
york
times
rule?
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
i
think
that
they
had
not
preempted
the
state
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
state
had
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
i
did
not
so
--
but,
i’ll
say
it.
in
the
case
--
now,
we
do
not
believe
the
publication
concerning
appellees
was
a
matter
of
public
or
general
interest.
while
the
appellees
join
the
union
or
not
it
could
hardly
be
said
to
be
of
any
interest
or
concern
for
the
public
generally.
the
majority
opinion
in
rosenbloom
expressed
--
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
i
think
it
is
--
i
think
they
are
probably
couched
in
such
terms
that
they
are
of
interest
to
a
limited
authorization
and
i
think
perhaps
if
we
read
the
medical
journal,
it
would
deal
with
probably
complex
medical
terms
would
not
be
a
general
interest
for
the
public
but
would
be
of
interest
to
medical
members
of
that
kind.
now,
as
i
stated,
the
majority
opinion
in
rosenbloom
expressed
to
future
determination
the
constitutional
standard
to
be
applied,
if
any
in
the
enforcement
of
state
libel
laws
published
by
news
media
by
the
person’s
activity,
not
within
the
area
of
public
--
i’m
sorry.
since
it
is
indicated
that
some
areas
of
a
person’s
activity
are
outside
area
of
general
or
public
concern,
we
urge
a
non-union
member’s
decision
not
to
join
union
is
outside
that
area
and,
nor
should
the
union
be
afforded
the
same
protection
as
is
the
court
in
news
media
nor
is
it
in
effect,
arming
the
union
with
a
club
to
deal
with
any
reculstive
worker
who
desire
to
exercise
his
right
not
to
join.
the
overriding
and
paramount
interest
here
is
protection
of
the
individual
workers.
it
has
been
said
by
union
that
linn
itself
required
application
of
the
new
york
times
rule.
however,
there
is
no
constitutional
compulsion
to
use
the
new
york
times
standard.
linn
decided
one
issue
and
one
issue
only.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
the
national
labor
--
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
perhaps.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
no,
sir.
i
have
not.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
that’s
right.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
that’s
clear,
yes.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
yes,
but
in
the
periphery
of
concern
they
are
not
in
the
direction,
sir.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
yes,
linn
does
so.
we
do
deal
in
linn
with
preemption.
i
have
to
say
that
linn
deals
with
that,
but
first
they
have
thought
that
we
say
it
was
not
--
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
it
was
not
preempted.
yes,
i
already
said
that.
now,
one
final
point
here
that
in
linn
and
in
reading
linn,
because
there
is
a
lot
of
language
in
linn
that
was
quoted
by
my
opponent
here
in
that
opinion
and
actually,
and
i
look
to
the
dissenting
opinion
to
see
what
they
said
it
means
and
they
said
that
what
the
majority
meant
was
a
malevolent
desire
to
injure,
which
is
not
the
new
york
times
rule.
they
defined
it
as
we’ve
said,
they
have
defined
it
as
a
malevolent
desire
to
injure,
and
that’s
not
the
new
york
times
standard
there.
so,
i
take
it,
and
they
did
use
in
the
majority
opinion,
they
did
use
that
language
also.
so,
i
take
it
that
that
was
it.
i
thank
you.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
the
court
please.
this
court
in
the
linn
case
afforded
workers
a
measure
of
protection
against
malicious
libel
for
causing
them
harm.
when
the
workers
were
given
that
measure
for
protection,
the
new
york
times
rule
had
already
been
promulgated
and
was
held
not
constitutionally
applicable.
today,
we
are
viewing
the
measure
of
protection
afforded
to
non-union
workers
in
the
light
of
the
progeny
of
new
york
times
as
curtis
publishing
co.
and
rosenbloom
versus
metromedia.
the
majority
opinion
in
rosenbloom
left
open
to
future
determination
the
extent
of
a
private
person’s
involvement
in
matters
of
public
interest.
mr.
justice
marshall,
in
his
dissent
in
rosenbloom
with
which
mr.
justice
stewart
and
mr.
justice
harlan
concurred,
pointed
out
that
two
essential
and
fundamental
values
conflict,
that
is
the
right
of
an
obscure
and
anonymous

for
protection
from
unjustified

and
wrongful
hurt
which
he
states
reflects
no
more
than
our
basic
concept
of
the
essential
dignity
and
work
of
every
human
being.
on
the
other
hand,
the
concept
of
a
citizen
informed
by
a
free
and
unfettered
press
with
this
conflict,
a
fundamental
right,
it
is
necessary
for
the
court
to
determine
which
of
the
fundamental
rights
is
a
more
compelling
and
paramount.
this
conflict
must
be
viewed
and
result
in
the
light
of
the
particular
circumstances
under
which
the
conflict
arose.
in
considering
the
rights
of
a
private
and
anonymous
citizen
giving
way
by
reason
of
his
being
involved
in
a
matter
of
general
public
interest,
the
right
of
a
public
to
be
informed
by
free
and
unfettered
press,
i
make
the
point
that
there
is
a
basic
difference
between
a
labor
union
and
public
media.
and
particularly
so
in
the
relationship
between
a
labor
union
and
a
non-union
worker
in
a
plant
or
organization
in
which
a
union
is
bargaining
agent.
union,
first,
is
not
concerned
with
informing
the
public
of
the
general
public,
but
is
concerned
with
promoting
its
own
particular
interests,
which
interests
are
in
direct
conflict
with
the
interest
of
a
non-union
worker.
the
union
newsletter
which
has
just
been
mentioned
was
circulated
only
to
union
members
and
not
to
the
general
public.
on
the
hand,
the
media’s
only
interest
is
in
informing
the
public
on
a
matter
which
is
of
general
or
public
interest.
it
is
without
bias
in
the
matter
and
this
was
not
true
in
the
case
of
the
union.
when
we
consider
that
this
background,
the
right
of
the
individual
of
non-union
worker
under
the
circumstances
here
of
merely
failing
or
refusing
to
join
union
as
against
the
right
of
the
general
public
to
know
even
if
this
could
be
considered
a
matter
of
general
public
interest.
the
compelling
and
paramount
interest,
we
assert,
is
clearly
that
of
the
non-union
worker.
if
union
had
this
right,
it
would
have
within
its
power,
by
publishing
in
its
newsletter,
to
make
anything
a
matter
of
public
interest,
then
that
has
the
bias.
the
organization
that
has
the
bias
would
have
the
right
of
making
it
a
matter
of
public
interest.
this
matter
that
we’re
talking
about
here
had
never
been
in
the
press,
it
had
never
been
discussed
anywhere.
it
was
strictly
between
union
and
these
particular
non-union
workers.
under
the
protection
of
the
new
york
times
rule,
a
standard
most
difficult
and
almost
impossible
of
proof
by
the
aggrieved
person,
union
would
be
able
to
harass
and
coerce
non-union
workers,
the
rights
of
non-union
workers
not
to
join
union
under
various
state
right
to
work
laws
and
in
the
instant
case,
under
the
executive
order
as
well,
would
be
largely
nullified.
now,
the
executive
order
does
say
specifically
that
the
union
cannot,
has
no
right
to
coerce
non-union
members
into
joining.
so
that
when
mr.
austin
went
to
the
postmaster
general
and
went
to
the
president
of
that
union
to
complain,
he
was
well
within
his
rights
to
say
they
are
attempting
to
coerce
me
and
they
themselves,
as
i
took
it
from
what
mr.
ratner
said
here
today,
for
practical
purposes
mentioned,
they
were
attempting
to

at

the

construe

would
mean

in

us,
the
president
of

it

it
violates
the
--
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
it
does
violate
that,
but
the
right
to
union
in
here
is
under
the
executive
order.
now,
that’s
what
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
says
that
it
was
under
that
that
they
are
permitted
to
--
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
yes,
i
don’t
think
--
i
think,
yes,
i
have
to
say
that
that’s
what
they
said.
they
have
the
right
to

the
national
labor
relations
act
says
they
have
no
right
to
coerce,
but
again,
that
is
on
the
periphery
concern
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
i
do
not
believe
so.
no,
sir.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
no
jurisdiction
was
ever

mr.

no,

cherry
that’s
right,
but
not
within
the

between
the
employer
and
the
union
and
whatnot.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
yes,

mr.

e.
cherry
well,
the
executive

does
say
that
they
shall

so.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
i
say
that
--
you
mean
as
to
the
new
york
times
rule?
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
i
think
that
they
had
not
preempted
the
state
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
state
had
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
i
did
not
so
--
but,
i’ll
say
it.
in
the
case
--
now,
we
do
not
believe
the
publication
concerning
appellees
was
a
matter
of
public
or
general
interest.
while
the
appellees
join
the
union
or
not
it
could
hardly
be
said
to
be
of
any
interest
or
concern
for
the
public
generally.
the
majority
opinion
in
rosenbloom
expressed
--
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
i
think
it
is
--
i
think
they
are
probably
couched
in
such
terms
that
they
are
of
interest
to
a
limited
authorization
and
i
think
perhaps
if
we
read
the
medical
journal,
it
would
deal
with
probably
complex
medical
terms
would
not
be
a
general
interest
for
the
public
but
would
be
of
interest
to
medical
members
of
that
kind.
now,
as
i
stated,
the
majority
opinion
in
rosenbloom
expressed
to
future
determination
the
constitutional
standard
to
be
applied,
if
any
in
the
enforcement
of
state
libel
laws
published
by
news
media
by
the
person’s
activity,
not
within
the
area
of
public
--
i’m
sorry.
since
it
is
indicated
that
some
areas
of
a
person’s
activity
are
outside
area
of
general
or
public
concern,
we
urge
a
non-union
member’s
decision
not
to
join
union
is
outside
that
area
and,
nor
should
the
union
be
afforded
the
same
protection
as
is
the
court
in
news
media
nor
is
it
in
effect,
arming
the
union
with
a
club
to
deal
with
any
reculstive
worker
who
desire
to
exercise
his
right
not
to
join.
the
overriding
and
paramount
interest
here
is
protection
of
the
individual
workers.
it
has
been
said
by
union
that
linn
itself
required
application
of
the
new
york
times
rule.
however,
there
is
no
constitutional
compulsion
to
use
the
new
york
times
standard.
linn
decided
one
issue
and
one
issue
only.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
the
national
labor
--
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
perhaps.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
no,
sir.
i
have
not.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
that’s
right.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
that’s
clear,
yes.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
yes,
but
in
the
periphery
of
concern
they
are
not
in
the
direction,
sir.
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
yes,
linn
does
so.
we
do
deal
in
linn
with
preemption.
i
have
to
say
that
linn
deals
with
that,
but
first
they
have
thought
that
we
say
it
was
not
--
mr.
parker
e.
cherry
it
was
not
preempted.
yes,
i
already
said
that.
now,
one
final
point
here
that
in
linn
and
in
reading
linn,
because
there
is
a
lot
of
language
in
linn
that
was
quoted
by
my
opponent
here
in
that
opinion
and
actually,
and
i
look
to
the
dissenting
opinion
to
see
what
they
said
it
means
and
they
said
that
what
the
majority
meant
was
a
malevolent
desire
to
injure,
which
is
not
the
new
york
times
rule.
they
defined
it
as
we’ve
said,
they
have
defined
it
as
a
malevolent
desire
to
injure,
and
that’s
not
the
new
york
times
standard
there.
so,
i
take
it,
and
they
did
use
in
the
majority
opinion,
they
did
use
that
language
also.
so,
i
take
it
that
that
was
it.
i
thank
you.
