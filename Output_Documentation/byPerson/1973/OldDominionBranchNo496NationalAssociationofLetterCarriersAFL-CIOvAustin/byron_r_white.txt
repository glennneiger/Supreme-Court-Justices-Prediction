justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
a
statutory
question
in
this
case
at
all
under
the
labor
relations
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don’t
you
think
you
should
deal
with
that
first
before
getting
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
isn’t
that
linn?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
--
i
don’t
suppose
we
reach
the
constitutional
question
or
metromedia
or
all
those
cases
if
linn
controls
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
linn
wasn’t
a
new
york
times
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
linn
test
applies,
this
judgment
shouldn’t
have
been
entered,
should
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
really?
you
think
this
was
consistent
with
linn?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
some
respects,
it
was
inconsistent?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
states
had
jurisdiction
to
it
provided
that
the
viable
was
proved
to
have
been
committed
with
malice,
as
defined
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
anyway,
what
is
your
position
with
respect
to
the
applicability
of
linn,
whatever
linn
means?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
is
that?
is
this
a
labor
dispute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
--
i
suppose
it’s
arguably
an
unfair
labor
practice
to
coerce
employees
to
join
a
labor
union,
isn’t
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn’t
that
as
plain
8
(b)
(3)?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
say
it’s
more
than
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
can’t
have
this
both
ways,
neither
can
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
your
position
then
as
to
why
linn
doesn’t
apply?
it
must
be
that
you
--
if
you’re
wrong
that
it’s
not
a
labor
dispute,
is
that
the
applicability
of
linn
turns
on,
whether
this
is
a
labor
dispute?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
reason
the
virginia
court
gave,
you
don’t
defend?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don’t
defend
the
reason
of
the
virginia
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
virginia
supreme
court
said
the
effect
of
the
executive
order
11491,
which
is
essentially
equivalent
in
both
content
and
purpose
with
the
national
labor
relations
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
if
it’s
essentially
equivalent,
there
must
be
some
authority
that
adjudicates
what’s
called
unfair
practices.
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
now
who
adjudicates
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
linn
is
a
preempted
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it’s
a
non-preempted
case
and
this
executive
order
referred
to
has
no
preemptive
effect
whatsoever
while
linn
is
beside
the
point,
then
you
do
reach
the
constitution
as
provided
in
linn.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
as
to
preemption
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
you
say
that
if
he
--
what
you’re
saying
is
that
the
union
tried
to
coerce
these
people
to
be
members.
justice
byron
r.
white
8
(b)
(3)
--
no,
8
(b)
(1)
interfered
with
restrain
of
coerced
employee
in
exercise
of
his
rights
assured
by
this
order.
now,
one
of
these
rights
is
to
be
or
not
to
be
a
member
of
a
labor
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
so

you

well,
i’m

that
may
be
so,
but
linn
takes
hold,
i
would
suppose,
when
arguably
something
is
an
unfair
practice
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
nlrb
or
some
comfortable
agency.
justice
byron

is

a
