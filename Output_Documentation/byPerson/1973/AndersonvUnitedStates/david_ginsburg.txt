mr.
david
ginsburg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit.
it
arises
in
logan
county,
west
virginia.
the
charging
statute
is
section
241
of
18
u.s.
code,
a
conspiracy
statute
that
has
been
before
this
court
many
times
before
most
recently
in
guest,
in
price
and
before
that
in
classic
in
williams
and
screws.
the
central
issue
as
we
understand
this
case
is
whether
an
alleged
conspiracy
to
cast
fraudulent
votes
in
the
state
primary
election,
in
this
particular
case
for
the
office
of
a
county
commissioner
of
logan
county,
west
virginia
states
a
federal
offense
under
section
241.
so
far
as
we
are
aware,
this
question
is
not
yet
been
ruled
upon
by
this
court.
now
the
government
finds
in
the
record
a
much
simpler
case.
it
contends
that
the
indictment
alleged
and
the
evidence
showed
two
separate
conspiracy
violations
for
casting
and
counting
fraudulent
votes.
one,
for
the
election
of
state
and
county
officers
and
the
other
for
the
election
of
candidates
for
federal
officers
and
the
government
regards
this
case
as
ruled
in
effect
by
saylor
in
classic
and
ingram
and
i
suspect
would
have
the
writ
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
the
facts
were
not
complicated.
the
petitioners
were
indited
on
january
12,
1971.
the
text
of
the
indictment
is
in
this
white
brief
of
our
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
court.
there
were
five
defendants,
all
of
them
were
state
officials.
william
anderson
was
clerk
of
the
county
court
of
logan
county.
john
browning,
clerk
of
the
circuit
court
of
logan
county,
its
intermediate
state
court.
ernest
red
hager
was
a
deputy
sheriff
of
logan
county,
bernard
smith
was
the
west
virginia
state
senator
and
earl
tomblin
was
the
sheriff
of
local
county.
a
paragraph
six
of
the
indictment
in
appendix
b
states
that
the
primary
election
that
was
held
in
west
virginia
on
may
12,
1970
for
the
purpose
of
nominating
candidates
for
two
federal
officers,
the
united
states
senate
and
the
us
representative
and
i
quote
“various
state
and
county
offices”.
mr.
david
ginsburg
on
a
single
ballot,
your
honor.
in
the
context
of
the
trial,
the
reference
to
the
federal
officers
proved
irrelevant
but
we
take
no
exception
to
this
aspect,
this
statement
of
fact
in
the
indictment.
our
paragraph
nine
describes
the
alleged
conspiracy.
mr.
david
ginsburg
it’s
beginning
i
think,
your
honor,
on
page
1b,
appendix
b
and
paragraph
nine.
it’s
in
this
white
brief.
mr.
david
ginsburg
the
petition
for
certiorari,
now
looking
on
pages
2b
and
3b.
mr.
david
ginsburg
a
paragraph
nine
describes
the
conspiracy
from
may
1,
1970
to
january
12,
1971
date
of
the
filing
of
the
indictment.
the
five
defendants
are
said
to
have
conspired
to
dilute
the
vote
of
qualified
voters
secured
to
them
by
the
constitution
of
laws
of
the
united
states
to
vote
for
the
aforesaid
officers
that
is
for
the
two
federal
officers
and
the
various
state
and
county
officers
which
are
described
in
paragraph
six.
now,
paragraph
10
of
the
indictment
ties
the
alleged
conspiracy
to
a
single
precinct
in
logan
county,
mount
gay
precinct
that
we’ll
hear
a
good
deal
about.
he
asserts
that
conspiracy
violated
state
law.
there’s
no
contest
about
that.
the
evidence
centers
around
what
happen
before
and
after
may
12,
1970
in
connection
with
the
voting
that
took
place
at
the
mount
gay
precinct.
there
are
no
allegations
in
this
case
of
racial
bias,
there’s
no
charge
that
voting
rights
were
in
anyway
denied
or
abridged
or
diluted
because
of
racial
color.
according
to
the
testimony,
these
five
defendants
with
the
help
of
three
election
officials
who
were
stationed
in
that
mount
gay
precinct,
setup
the
house
that
merely
means
that
the
defendants
these
five
men
obtained
the
help
and
the
cooperation
of
three
people
within
the
precinct
office
to
attain
their
purpose.
now,
what
was
their
purpose?
their
purpose
was
to
secure
the
democratic
nomination
for
county
commissioner
of
a
man
named
okey
hager
who
headed
a
slate
for
various
state
and
local
offices.
okey
hager
was
already
the
incumbent
county
commissioner
and
he
is
the
father
of
ernest
that’s
red
hager
who
was
one
of
the
defendants
in
this
case.
there
is
a
testimony
that
a
man
named
cecil
elswick
who
was
one
of
those
three
people
stationed
at
the
mount
gay
precinct
and
he
was
a
co-conspirator
that
granted
immunity
by
the
government,
cast
false
and
fictitious
ballots
on
the
voting
machines
at
mount
gay
for
the
entire
hager
slate
and
he
got
rid
of
poll
slips,
destroyed
them
so
that
the
number
of
voters
could
not
be
determined
except
from
the
machine
tally.
the
trial
lasted
twelve
days,
the
transcript
is
nearly
2,000
pages
long
and
the
five
defendants
were
all
found
guilty
under
241
and
given
provisional
maximum
sentences
of
10
years
imprisonment.
i
spoke
of
the
hager’s
slate.
what
is
the
role
of
the
federal
officials
in
relation
to
the
hager
slate?
okey
hager’s
major
opponent
for
county
commissioner
was
a
man
named
neal
scaggs.
hager
and
scaggs
each
headed
a
democratic
party
slate
or
faction.
now,
repeatedly
in
its
brief,
the
government
says
that
senator
byrd
and
congressman
hechler
who
were
seeking
renomination
in
1970,
were
on
the
hager
slate
and
that
the
mount
gay
precinct
was
setup
to
ensure
the
nomination
of
all
candidates,
state
and
federal.
we
find
no
support
in
the
record
for
this
view.
so
far
as
we
can
tell,
neither
byrd
nor
hechler
was
on
the
hager
slate
or
part
of
the
hager
faction
and
the
alleged
conspiracy
of
these
five
defendants
was
limited
to
certain
state
and
county
offices
including
the
[voice
overlap]
committee.
mr.
david
ginsburg
in
the
evidence
actually
introduced
at
the
trial,
your
honor.
now,
there’s
some
evidence
that
cecil
elswick
did
cast
unlawful
votes
for
byrd
and
hechler
in
the
mount
gay
precinct
but
we
have
found
no
evidence
in
the
record,
your
honor,
and
we’ve
examined
all
of
the
government’s
record
references
that
byrd
and
hechler
were
the
object
of
any
conspiracy
or
that
they
were
on
the
hager
slate
at
all.
mr.
david
ginsburg
there
might.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes.
i’m
about
to
go,
your
honor,
into
the
statistics
of
what
actually
happened
there.
now,
this
was
a
democratic
party
primary.
byrd
and
hager
were
important,
incumbent
federal
officials
seeking
renomination.
they
were
clearly
supported,
that
is
byrd
and
hechler,
by
both
factions.
it
happens
that
neal
scaggs
slate
is
in
the
record
and
there
is
no
candidate
for
federal
office
on
it.
yet
in
31
precincts
that
scaggs
won,
that
is
out
of
the
59
reporting
precinct
in
logan
county,
byrd
won
by
over
94%
and
hechler
by
over
79%.
now,
when
we
examined
the
returns
for
logan
county
as
a
whole,
counting
all
of
the
59
precincts
including
those
won
by
hager.
we
find
that
byrd
won
by
95%
and
hechler
by
some
82%.
he
went
up
by
3%
in
the
county
as
a
whole.
now,
your
honors,
it
would
have
been
an
absolute
absurdity
to
setup
by
single
precinct
out
of
59
in
logan
county
for
byrd
who
was
running
statewide,
55
counties
in
west
virginia,
60
precincts
in
the
state
--
in
the
county
of
logan,
setup
one
precinct
for
byrd.
or
for
hechler,
hechler
had
a
large
congressional
district
including
eight
counties.
there
was
absolutely
no
political
justification
to
setup
mount
gay
for
byrd
or
hechler.
now,
whatever
conspiracy
these
defendants
may
have
entered
into
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
candidates
for
federal
office,
for
these
defendants,
the
contest
was
between
scaggs
and
hager.
now,
even
the
government’s
key
witness,
cecil
elswick
and
it
was
he
who
testified
that
he
had
put
the
illegal
votes
on
the
machine.
he
was
very
careful
to
separate
byrd
and
hechler
from
the
hager
slate.
there
are
excerpts
from
elswick
testimony
of
the
government’s
brief
but
each
time
that
elswick
referred
to
byrd
and
hechler,
and
there
are
only
two
references,
your
honors,
in
the
2000-page
transcript.
he
speaks
of
helping
to
win
“for
the
okey
hager
slate”
and
for
byrd
and
hechler.
wholly
natural
because
hager,
the
red
hager
who
was
one
of
the
defendants
in
this
case
also
happen
to
be
the
county’s
democratic
executive,
head
of
the
counties,
chairman
of
the
county
democratic
executive
committee.
now,
we
simply
invite
the
court
to
examine
the
government’s
transcript
references.
none
of
them
we
believe,
we’ve
examined
them,
all
supports
the
governments
conclusion
that
the
hager
slate
included
byrd
and
hechler
or
that
this
conspiracy
was
in
anyway
directed
toward
byrd
and
hechler.
now,
let’s
take
at
look
what
happened
at
the
trial.
what
was
the
government’s
theory
at
the
trial
below
in
the
district
court
before
judge
field.
now,
again,
although
the
indictment
included
a
reference
to
federal
officials
indicated
in
the
text
of
the
indictment,
the
case
was
tried
in
the
district
court
as
a
conspiracy
to
secure
the
democratic
nomination
for
county
commissioner
for
okey
hager.
the
assistant
us
attorney
in
his
opening
statement
made
this
clear.
he
repeated
this
again
in
his
closing
statement
and
then
when
the
case
came
up
to
the
fourth
circuit,
the
fourth
circuit
concluded
“the
true
object
and
purpose
of
the
alleged
conspiracy
was
to
secure
the
democratic
nomination
of
okey
hager
as
county
judge.”
now
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
f
the
government
had
proved
its
case,
both
as
against
the
state
and
the
federal
officials,
it
had
proved
any
case
against
the
federal
officials,
yes,
your
honor,
we
would
not
be
making
this
argument.
mr.
david
ginsburg
we
indicated
that
in
our
brief.
mr.
david
ginsburg
he
was
indeed
but
there
was
no
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
would
hope
so
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
absolutely
and
i
would
hope
so
that
it
would
suppose
that
what
this
man
did
was
to
go
out,
that
is
hager,
red
hager
as
county
chairman,
go
out
to
seek
support
for
his
candidates.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no,
but
not
for
this
purpose.
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
record,
mr.
chief
justice
that
there’s
on
--
that
indicates
that
the
conspiracy
was
directed
to
the
federal
officers.
they
had
only
one
interest.
this
was
the
county
chairman’s
job
which
was
a
very
important
job
in
that
county
control
patronage.
it
was
a
job
that
was
very
considerable
importance
in
logan
county
and
this
was
the
subject
of
the
conspiracy
not
in
anyway,
so
far
as
the
record
indicates
anything
having
to
do
with
byrd
and
hechler.
and
as
i
said
before,
it
would
have
been
a
nonsense
for
these
people
to
proceed
to
try
to
setup
a
single
precinct
in
a
large
county
for
a
man
running
statewide.
it
didn’t
happen,
couldn’t
have
happened,
there
is
a
practical
political
matter.
now,
what
did
the
fourth
circuit
do
with
this
case?
on
the
authority
of
price
and
guess,
it
affirmed.
now,
the
fourth
circuit
found
that
section
241,
and
we’re
presenting
to
the
court
an
issue
of
interpretation,
covered
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights
including
voting
rights
protected
by
the
equal
protection
clause.
in
effect,
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
in
a
primary
where
federal
officers
were
also
on
the
ballot,
a
conspiracy
to
cast
fraudulent
ballot
for
state
office
in
which
state
election
officials
take
part,
results
in
the
denial
of
equal
protection
and
violates
section
241
even
though
the
conspiracy
was
not
directed
against
federal
office,
that’s
the
issue
as
we
see
it.
and
this
is
the
first
case
we
find
that
has
--
of
this
sort
has
come
before
the
court.
now,
the
question
i’m
raising
and
we’ll
consider
now
is
whether
section
241
does
cover
state
voting
frauds.
now,
the
history
of
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
would
certainly
agree
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
the
article
1
sections
2
and
4,
your
honor.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes
this
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
the
court
has
ruled
on
this
issue
and
it
seems
to
me
clear
and
separate.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
david
ginsburg
oh,
i
think
the
court
has
dealt
with
this
before
in
classic
and
before
classic
and
in
saylor.
mr.
david
ginsburg
it
would,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no.
mr.
david
ginsburg
exactly
so,
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
exactly
right
and
this
is
what
i’m
proceeding
to.
consider
the
fourteenth
amendment
aspect
of
section
241
as
contrasted
with
the
article
1
sections
2
and
4
aspect
of
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
exactly.
now,
this
is
a
well-plowed
field
as
the
questioning
has
already
indicated
and
every
lawyer
who's
read
the
decisions
knows
that
this
field
is
also
well-mined.
now,
obviously
the
congress
didn’t
intend
the
1870
act
to
apply
to
non-federal
elections
unless
some
form
of
racial
discrimination
was
involved.
indeed
it
was
convinced
in
1870
and
the
history
has
shown
in
many
decision
of
this
court
at
that
time
the
congress
had
felt
that
the
court
--
the
congress
felt
that
it
had
no
constitutional
authority
in
this
field.
but
today,
we
do
not
question
the
existence
of
constitutional
authority.
the
question
we’re
submitting
to
this
court
is
whether
without
congressional
sanction
section
241
should
now
by
interpretation
of
this
court,
be
extended
to
cover
the
federal
policing
of
state
and
local
elections
where
racial
discrimination
is
not
shown
and
it’s
not
an
issue.
that
i
believe
is
a
central
issue
in
this
case.
now,
so
far
in
my
view,
your
honor,
the
courts
could
extend
guest
and
price
to
cover
anderson
although
the
indictment
and
the
record
in
this
particular
case
would
i
think
present
the
court
with
troublesome
problems
that
i’ll
come
to
in
a
moment.
we
urge
however
that
the
court
leave
the
decision
on
federal
policing
of
state
and
local
elections
to
the
states
and
to
the
congress
where
again
racial
bias
is
not
shown.
there’s
ample
legal
justification
for
it.
the
congress
has
considered
this
matter
many
times
before,
most
recently
i
think
in
1957
and
1964
and
again
in
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
the
legislative
history
is
fully
set
forth
in
our
brief.
there’s
no
need
for
the
court
to
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
into
this
area
which
so
far
has
been
reserved
to
the
states.
the
authority
which
the
government
now
seeks
from
this
court
for
its
prosecuting
attorneys
has
been
deliberately
and
consistently
withheld
by
the
congress
and
it’s
peculiarly
the
kind
of
authority
which
lends
itself
to
partisan
and
even
geographically
discriminatory
political
direction.
the
states
we
submit
must
be
given
a
full
opportunity
to
come
to
grips
with
these
issues
of
corruption.
we’ve
see
it
maryland,
we’ve
seen
that
in
new
jersey
what’s
been
happening
and
even
in
west
virginia
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor.
a
state
grand
jury
had
been
called
and
had
come
in
to
session
and
it
was
the
us
attorney
as
we
understand
it
who
asked
that
the
state
grand
jury
not
be
convened
and
warned
that
if
it
were
convened,
the
government
would
seek
an
injunction
to
stop
it.
now,
let
me
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
indictment.
again,
paragraph
nine
of
the
indictment
charged
to
the
defendants
with
the
conspiracy
to
injure
the
qualified
voters
of
logan
county
by
denying
them
the
right
to
have
their
votes
fully
counted,
by
having
their
votes
diluted.
defendants
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment
and
the
motion
was
denied
on
the
ground
that
the
indictment
adequately
charged
the
defendants
under
section
241.
at
trial,
the
government
sought
to
prove
a
conspiracy
that
had
at
its
object
not
the
office
of
senator
or
representative
but
county
commissioner.
the
indictment
didn’t
specify
the
state
or
county
office
which
was
the
object
of
the
conspiracy.
the
indictment
didn’t
suggest
that
the
five
defendants
or
their
three
co-conspirators
were
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
it
did
not
identify
the
separate
constitutional
rights
or
rights
which
were
allegedly
denied,
and
as
a
practical
matter,
it
failed
clearly
to
inform
the
defendants
of
the
charges
against
them
and
all
of
their
subsequent
motions
for
discovery
and
clarification
were
denied.
it
wasn’t
until
the
trial
began
that
the
defendants
and
their
counsels
first
learned
that
the
alleged
conspiracy
involved
the
state
office
and
it
wasn’t
until
the
fourth
day
of
trial
that
they
know
who
the
unnamed
co-conspirators
were
and
where
the
acts
took
place.
now,
the
deficiencies
--
well,
if
in
the
indictment
and
this
goes
to
a
point
of
the
question
mr.
justice
brennan
asked.
the
government
had
at
least
separated
the
two
alleged
offenses
in
separate
counts.
the
court
and
the
defendants
would
have
been
in
a
position
to
challenge
the
legal
sufficiency
of
section
241
and
its
application
to
state
and
county
offices
and
at
the
close
of
the
government
case
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
relation
to
the
federal
charge.
this
wasn’t
done.
here
the
government
was
in
the
enviable
position
of
being
able
to
defend
a
motion
to
dismiss
by
arguing
that
a
conspiracy
to
cast
fraudulent
votes
in
a
federal
election
clearly
stated
an
offense
under
section
241
and
then
proceed
to
try
the
case
on
the
basis
of
a
conspiracy
to
cast
votes
in
an
election
for
a
local
office
and
on
appeal
the
government
will
then
be
free
to
urge
affirmance
on
whatever
basis
that
felt
emerge
in
the
record.
mr.
david
ginsburg
we
did
move
to
dismiss,
your
honor.
it
was
overruled.
section
241
is
a
conspiracy
statute
which
required
no
overt
act
does
an
element
of
defense
i
don’t
have
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
this
court
the
kinds
of
problems
where
justice
jackson
dealt
with
and
described
in
his
separate
opinion
in
krulewitch.
this
indictment,
your
honor,
was
defective
and
it
wasn’t
cured
by
anything
by
the
evidence
brought
out
in
the
trial.
it
was
subsequently
and
substantially
defective
and
it
wasn’t
the
case
of
a
meeting
any
magic
or
talismanic
words.
it
simply
didn’t
frame
the
issues
which
already
been
be
framed
by
the
questions
of
this
court
but
there’s
still
another
problem,
that
the
government
fails
to
come
to
grips
with.
the
indictments
charged
that
the
defendants
conspired
to
dilute
votes
in
two
federal
officers.
this
gets
to
the
point
that
mr.
justice
brennan
inquired.
the
integrity
of
federal
elections
is
protected
as
indicated
by
sections
2
and
4
of
article
1,
the
integrity
of
state
and
local
elections
is
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
screws,
one
of
the
landmark
cases
of
the
court
in
this
area,
the
court
held
that
in
order
to
prevent
serious
doubts
about
unconstitutional
vagueness
in
section
242,
a
companion
statute,
we’re
dealing
here
with
241,
it
was
242
in
screws
where
the
term
willful
was
used.
the
term
willful,
this
court
said
in
that
section
must
be
construed
to
mean
a
purpose
to
deprive
a
person
of
a
specific
constitutional
right
and
then
it
said
that
that
issue
must
be
submitted
to
the
jury
under
appropriate
instructions.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i’ll
continue
--
i’ll
reserve
three
minutes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
ginsburg
we’re
dealing
here
with
an
alleged
voting
frauds
in
federal
and
state
elections
under
separate
constitutional
provisions
due
to
the
facts.
now,
under
screws
and
price
combined,
the
government
was
required
to
demonstrate
specific
intent
to
violate
each
of
these
provisions
and
the
court,
the
district
court,
was
required
to
submit
these
issues
to
the
jury
under
its
charge.
the
district
court
of
course
failed
to
do
that,
the
indictment
failed
to
separate
the
constitutional
provisions
and
no
such
charge
was
made.
now,
the
essential
problem
was
the
defect
in
the
indictment
and
that
obscurity
wasn’t
cleared
by
the
evidence
that
came
in
the
trial.
if
this
was
a
multiple
conspiracy,
as
the
government
contends,
then
neither
the
prosecutors
nor
lawyers
that
tried
the
case,
nor
the
district
court
that
heard
it
nor
the
fourth
circuit
that
reviewed
it,
appreciated
that
fact.
now,
i
have
one
final
point
and
that
is
on
the
matter
of
the
relief
we
have
requested.
under
a
very
broad
section
241
indictment,
the
government
security
conviction
on
the
assumption
that
this
court
had
already
ruled.
that
241
permits
the
government,
federal
government,
to
police
state,
the
voting
frauds
and
asking
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
below.
we’re
simply
asking
the
court
not
to
extend
the
jurisdiction
of
section
241
to
local
elections
where
no
racial
fraud
is
shown
but
we
do
recognize
in
this
in
response
to
questions
that
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked.
we
do
recognize
that
the
government
might
have
presented
evidence,
if
they
had
any,
under
the
same
indictment
showing
a
conspiracy
by
these
five
defendants
to
cast
fraudulent
votes
in
a
federal
election.
it
didn’t
do
so
but
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
government
should
now
be
given
a
chance
to
produce
such
evidence,
if
it
has
it,
then
we
urge
that
the
decision
below
be
reversed
on
the
issue
of
statutory
interpretation
and
remanded
for
trial
under
appropriate
instructions
on
the
federal
issue.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no,
your
honor.
the
indictment
failed
to
separate
these
two
constitutional
provisions
and
there
was
no
evidence
submitted
in
the
trial
on
the
federal
issue.
now,
our
position
is
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
its
day
in
court
if
it
has
such
evidence
and
the
case
can
be
sent
back
for
trial
on
the
federal
issue.
mr.
david
ginsburg
exactly
so,
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
your
honor,
let
me
be
perfectly
frank
with
this
court
that
it’s
quite
clear
that
these
issues
were
not
sought
to
be
brought
out
in
the
district
court.
the
case
was
tried
without
reference
to
it.
it
came
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
issue
wasn’t
briefed
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
oral
argument.
there
began
to
be
some
awareness
that
there
was
a
federal
issue
on
a
problem
of
a
statutory
interpretation
but
the
case
was
obscure
and
the
issue
has
been
finally
delineated
only
before
this
court.
mr.
david
ginsburg
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
essentially
for
this
court
as
far
as
we
been
able
to
analyze
the
case
and
the
record
as
you’ve
indicated
is
obscure
is
that
the
fourth
circuit
really
did
rule
on
the
issue
of
statutory
interpretation
and
it
did
hold,
it
extended
your
decisions
in
price.
mr.
david
ginsburg
we
failed
to
appreciate
that
point,
your
honor.
it’s
--
we
can’t
--there
was
the
it
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
issue
to
which
you
have
reference
arised
in
this
fashion.
there
was
an
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
federal
election
had
been
certified
15
days
after
the
recount
and
the
defendants
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals
early
that
after
the
federal
election
had
been
certified,
no
evidence,
what
had
happened
and
then
it
subsequent
investigation
should
have
been
introduced
and
the
court
overruled
that.
they
said,
“yes,
go
ahead”
and
they
introduced
that
evidence
but
the
essential
thrust
that
seems
to
us
as
we
read
the
decision
is
that
that
court
passed
on
the
issue
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
having
to
do
with
a
state
election
satisfied
--
fell
under
the
jurisdiction
of
section
241.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
arguably?
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes.
mr.
david
ginsburg
if
the
evidence
was
improperly
introduced,
my
view
would
be
at
that
point
that
there
would
be
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
even
having
to
do
with
the
statement.
mr.
david
ginsburg
it
would
in
my
view
because
there
would
be
no
evidence
in
the
record.
this
is
the
essential
evidence
in
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
don’t
quarrel
with
that
analysis
as
we
see
the
case
at
the
moment,
the
government
at
least
as
the
case
has
presented
at
both
below
in
the
intermediate
court
and
here,
as
it
finally
reaches
here,
is
simply
that
a
federal
violation
was
charged
and
therefore
we
have
the
right
to
come
in
under
section
241.
we
say
that
a
state
voting
fraud
was
a
conspiracy
was
shown,
if
it
was
shown
there.
but
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
federal
election
and
that
the
statute
should
not
be
extended.
mr.
david
ginsburg
the
court,
your
honor,
until
now
has
refused,
deliberately
refused,
after
the
most
mature
consideration
to
extend
it
so
far.
if
it’s
done,
this
would
be
the
first
time
in
judicial
history
that
section
241
has
sought
to
be
applied.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no
doubt,
your
honor,
regarding
constitutional
power.
we
raised
no
question
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
section
5,
the
congress
can
clearly
reach
it
and
indeed
they
are
debating
it.
they
debated
it
over
the
past
10
years,
there
are
bills
pending
today
dealing
with
these
problems
and
there’s
no
doubt
too
that
the
state
could
deal
with
it
and
many
states
had
dealt
with
it
that
effectively.
the
issue
really
is
whether
this
section
should
now
by
interpretation
of
this
court
be
extended
without
the
sanction
or
prior
consideration
by
the
counsel.
mr.
david
ginsburg
exactly
right,
sir.
if
there's
racial
discrimination,
there’s
no
doubt
in
our
view.
we’re
not
urging
that
point
that
section
241,
in
our
view,
would
be
applicable.
mr.
david
ginsburg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
government
has
said
that
this
is
a
single
conspiracy
and
of
course
the
re-indictment
was
so
framed.
this
is
one
of
the
errors
in
the
government’s,
in
the
way
the
case
was
tried
below.
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
in
the
appendix
that
printed
page
854,
i’m
now
reading
from
the
government’s
closing
statement,
“in
the
summary
of
the
evidence
introduced
in
that
case,
i
think
from
the
evidence
that
mr.
kingley(ph),
you
can
conclude
by
now
that
the
theory
behind
the
government's
case
actually
is
that
this
vote
for
cast
encountered
by
going
through
the
contest
and
all
in
order
to
get
okey
hager
elected
to
the
county
court.
in
order
to
get
red
hager’s
father
elected
to
the
county
court
that
these
defendants
along
with
others
got
the
votes
cast
and
got
the
votes
counted
in
the
long
drawn
out
procedure
that
was
involved
over
there.
there
are
other
references
and
it
was
through
--
the
indictment
charged
a
federal
offense.
the
attempted
proof
was
a
conspiracy
to
get
okey
hager
elected
county
commissioner.
mr.
david
ginsburg
this
was
the
language,
mr.
justice
marshall,
to
which
i
had
reference
during
the
oral
argument.
i
pointed
out
specifically
and
this
was
clearly
understood
at
the
time
the
record
in
this
case
is
a
sociological
document
of
what
exists
in
logan
county,
west
virginia,
pages
six
and
seven.
and
one
case
for
the
okey
hager’s
slate
he
was
casting
vote
and
senator
byrd
and
hechler.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
was
putting
them
on
for
senator
byrd
and
ken
hechler
and
the
okey
hager
slate.
there
were
two.
the
point
was
that
they
were
all
for
ken
hechler.
they
were
all
for
senator
byrd
and
the
problem
was
did
this
conspiracy
direct
itself
to
hechler
and
byrd
or
was
it
limited
to
the
county
commissioner.
our
submission
on
the
record
of
this
case,
check
every
citation
that
the
government
has
given
to
you,
is
that
the
conspiracy
was
limited
to
this
job
of
county
commissioner.
had
nothing
to
do
with
byrd
and
hechler?
they
were
all
for
byrd
and
hechler
in
logan
county,
west
virginia,
95%
of
the
vote
went
for
them.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes,
i
think
so,
sir.
because
as
we
read
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
to
which
we’ve
had
so
much
reference,
the
court
felt
apparently
as
we
do
here
that
the
submission
of
the
government
was
a
submission
of
a
case
on
the
basis
of
a
state
fraud
and
they
felt
it
necessary
to
extend
section
241
to
local-state
fraudulent
voting
issue.
just
on
the
issue
of
constitutional
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
just
on
the
issue
of
constitutional
power
there
is
no
question
of
ample
constitutional
power
to
deal
with
these
matters
whether
it
has
to
do
with
sexual
discrimination
or
the
kind
of
vote
frauds
that
dealt
within
this
case.
the
issue
is
whether
section
241
will
now
be
extended
by
this
court
into
this
area
on
this
record.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
think
if
the
conspiracy,
my
position
would
be
the
same
on
the
record
on
this
case,
there’s
no
doubt
of
that.
because
the
conspiracy
that
was
shown
the
only
conspiracy
that
was
shown
under
section
241,
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
and
that
will
take
you
into
a
consideration
of
the
evidence
in
the
record,
and
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
we
can
find
is
that
when
these
people
talked
among
themselves
as
to
what
they
were
going
to
do,
they
were
talking
about
okey
hager
and
there
was
no
consideration,
no
discussion,
no
effort
to
direct
any
concerted
action
in
the
in
the
election
of
hechler
and
byrd.
mr.
david
ginsburg
well,
we’ve
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
mr.
justice
white,
we
have
played
with
this
necessary
and
probable
consequences
of
their
intended
act
and
we’ve
tried
to
analyze
it
in
those
terms
but
the
reality
is,
as
this
record
shows,
the
transcript,
the
2000
pages
of
it,
that
these
people
were
concerned
with
something
real
to
them
and
that
real
was
this
county
commissioner
judge.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no,
we
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
but
the
conspiracy
was
not
directed
against
the
--
for
federal
office.
the
only
conspiracy
that
was
shown
in
the
record
was
a
conspiracy
that
was
limited
to
the
local
office.
mr.
david
ginsburg
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
government
nothing
is
shown
of
that.
mr.
david
ginsburg
that
was
clearly
the
assumption
and
that
the
--
but
the
issues
with
which
they
were
dealing
--
the
only
issues
with
which
they
were
concerned
and
indeed
the
only
issue
that
was
involved
in
the
election
contest
was
what?
okey
hager
is
the
county
commissioner.
these
were
their
concerns.
they
had
no
concern
in
their
own
interest
in
the
problem
of
the
senate
or
the
house
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
well,
but
only
as
individuals
not
as
conspirators.
this
is
the
--
i
think
the
central
issue.
mr.
david
ginsburg
clearly
some
votes
were
cast
for
federal
office
by
man
named
elswick
who
actually
pulled
the
lever
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
he
was
a
member
of
the
--
one
of
the
conspiracy.
he
was
a
co-conspirator,
actually
not
a
defendant
with
given
immunity
in
this
case
and
the
issue
is
whether
he
took
his
instructions
from
hager
who
was
one
of
the
defendants
or
whether
he
took
this
instructions
from
conspirators
as
such.
mr.
david
ginsburg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
fourth
circuit.
it
arises
in
logan
county,
west
virginia.
the
charging
statute
is
section
241
of
18
u.s.
code,
a
conspiracy
statute
that
has
been
before
this
court
many
times
before
most
recently
in
guest,
in
price
and
before
that
in
classic
in
williams
and
screws.
the
central
issue
as
we
understand
this
case
is
whether
an
alleged
conspiracy
to
cast
fraudulent
votes
in
the
state
primary
election,
in
this
particular
case
for
the
office
of
a
county
commissioner
of
logan
county,
west
virginia
states
a
federal
offense
under
section
241.
so
far
as
we
are
aware,
this
question
is
not
yet
been
ruled
upon
by
this
court.
now
the
government
finds
in
the
record
a
much
simpler
case.
it
contends
that
the
indictment
alleged
and
the
evidence
showed
two
separate
conspiracy
violations
for
casting
and
counting
fraudulent
votes.
one,
for
the
election
of
state
and
county
officers
and
the
other
for
the
election
of
candidates
for
federal
officers
and
the
government
regards
this
case
as
ruled
in
effect
by
saylor
in
classic
and
ingram
and
i
suspect
would
have
the
writ
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
the
facts
were
not
complicated.
the
petitioners
were
indited
on
january
12,
1971.
the
text
of
the
indictment
is
in
this
white
brief
of
our
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
court.
there
were
five
defendants,
all
of
them
were
state
officials.
william
anderson
was
clerk
of
the
county
court
of
logan
county.
john
browning,
clerk
of
the
circuit
court
of
logan
county,
its
intermediate
state
court.
ernest
red
hager
was
a
deputy
sheriff
of
logan
county,
bernard
smith
was
the
west
virginia
state
senator
and
earl
tomblin
was
the
sheriff
of
local
county.
a
paragraph
six
of
the
indictment
in
appendix
b
states
that
the
primary
election
that
was
held
in
west
virginia
on
may
12,
1970
for
the
purpose
of
nominating
candidates
for
two
federal
officers,
the
united
states
senate
and
the
us
representative
and
i
quote
“various
state
and
county
offices”.
mr.
david
ginsburg
on
a
single
ballot,
your
honor.
in
the
context
of
the
trial,
the
reference
to
the
federal
officers
proved
irrelevant
but
we
take
no
exception
to
this
aspect,
this
statement
of
fact
in
the
indictment.
our
paragraph
nine
describes
the
alleged
conspiracy.
mr.
david
ginsburg
it’s
beginning
i
think,
your
honor,
on
page
1b,
appendix
b
and
paragraph
nine.
it’s
in
this
white
brief.
mr.
david
ginsburg
the
petition
for
certiorari,
now
looking
on
pages
2b
and
3b.
mr.
david
ginsburg
a
paragraph
nine
describes
the
conspiracy
from
may
1,
1970
to
january
12,
1971
date
of
the
filing
of
the
indictment.
the
five
defendants
are
said
to
have
conspired
to
dilute
the
vote
of
qualified
voters
secured
to
them
by
the
constitution
of
laws
of
the
united
states
to
vote
for
the
aforesaid
officers
that
is
for
the
two
federal
officers
and
the
various
state
and
county
officers
which
are
described
in
paragraph
six.
now,
paragraph
10
of
the
indictment
ties
the
alleged
conspiracy
to
a
single
precinct
in
logan
county,
mount
gay
precinct
that
we’ll
hear
a
good
deal
about.
he
asserts
that
conspiracy
violated
state
law.
there’s
no
contest
about
that.
the
evidence
centers
around
what
happen
before
and
after
may
12,
1970
in
connection
with
the
voting
that
took
place
at
the
mount
gay
precinct.
there
are
no
allegations
in
this
case
of
racial
bias,
there’s
no
charge
that
voting
rights
were
in
anyway
denied
or
abridged
or
diluted
because
of
racial
color.
according
to
the
testimony,
these
five
defendants
with
the
help
of
three
election
officials
who
were
stationed
in
that
mount
gay
precinct,
setup
the
house
that
merely
means
that
the
defendants
these
five
men
obtained
the
help
and
the
cooperation
of
three
people
within
the
precinct
office
to
attain
their
purpose.
now,
what
was
their
purpose?
their
purpose
was
to
secure
the
democratic
nomination
for
county
commissioner
of
a
man
named
okey
hager
who
headed
a
slate
for
various
state
and
local
offices.
okey
hager
was
already
the
incumbent
county
commissioner
and
he
is
the
father
of
ernest
that’s
red
hager
who
was
one
of
the
defendants
in
this
case.
there
is
a
testimony
that
a
man
named
cecil
elswick
who
was
one
of
those
three
people
stationed
at
the
mount
gay
precinct
and
he
was
a
co-conspirator
that
granted
immunity
by
the
government,
cast
false
and
fictitious
ballots
on
the
voting
machines
at
mount
gay
for
the
entire
hager
slate
and
he
got
rid
of
poll
slips,
destroyed
them
so
that
the
number
of
voters
could
not
be
determined
except
from
the
machine
tally.
the
trial
lasted
twelve
days,
the
transcript
is
nearly
2,000
pages
long
and
the
five
defendants
were
all
found
guilty
under
241
and
given
provisional
maximum
sentences
of
10
years
imprisonment.
i
spoke
of
the
hager’s
slate.
what
is
the
role
of
the
federal
officials
in
relation
to
the
hager
slate?
okey
hager’s
major
opponent
for
county
commissioner
was
a
man
named
neal
scaggs.
hager
and
scaggs
each
headed
a
democratic
party
slate
or
faction.
now,
repeatedly
in
its
brief,
the
government
says
that
senator
byrd
and
congressman
hechler
who
were
seeking
renomination
in
1970,
were
on
the
hager
slate
and
that
the
mount
gay
precinct
was
setup
to
ensure
the
nomination
of
all
candidates,
state
and
federal.
we
find
no
support
in
the
record
for
this
view.
so
far
as
we
can
tell,
neither
byrd
nor
hechler
was
on
the
hager
slate
or
part
of
the
hager
faction
and
the
alleged
conspiracy
of
these
five
defendants
was
limited
to
certain
state
and
county
offices
including
the
[voice
overlap]
committee.
mr.
david
ginsburg
in
the
evidence
actually
introduced
at
the
trial,
your
honor.
now,
there’s
some
evidence
that
cecil
elswick
did
cast
unlawful
votes
for
byrd
and
hechler
in
the
mount
gay
precinct
but
we
have
found
no
evidence
in
the
record,
your
honor,
and
we’ve
examined
all
of
the
government’s
record
references
that
byrd
and
hechler
were
the
object
of
any
conspiracy
or
that
they
were
on
the
hager
slate
at
all.
mr.
david
ginsburg
there
might.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes.
i’m
about
to
go,
your
honor,
into
the
statistics
of
what
actually
happened
there.
now,
this
was
a
democratic
party
primary.
byrd
and
hager
were
important,
incumbent
federal
officials
seeking
renomination.
they
were
clearly
supported,
that
is
byrd
and
hechler,
by
both
factions.
it
happens
that
neal
scaggs
slate
is
in
the
record
and
there
is
no
candidate
for
federal
office
on
it.
yet
in
31
precincts
that
scaggs
won,
that
is
out
of
the
59
reporting
precinct
in
logan
county,
byrd
won
by
over
94%
and
hechler
by
over
79%.
now,
when
we
examined
the
returns
for
logan
county
as
a
whole,
counting
all
of
the
59
precincts
including
those
won
by
hager.
we
find
that
byrd
won
by
95%
and
hechler
by
some
82%.
he
went
up
by
3%
in
the
county
as
a
whole.
now,
your
honors,
it
would
have
been
an
absolute
absurdity
to
setup
by
single
precinct
out
of
59
in
logan
county
for
byrd
who
was
running
statewide,
55
counties
in
west
virginia,
60
precincts
in
the
state
--
in
the
county
of
logan,
setup
one
precinct
for
byrd.
or
for
hechler,
hechler
had
a
large
congressional
district
including
eight
counties.
there
was
absolutely
no
political
justification
to
setup
mount
gay
for
byrd
or
hechler.
now,
whatever
conspiracy
these
defendants
may
have
entered
into
had
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
candidates
for
federal
office,
for
these
defendants,
the
contest
was
between
scaggs
and
hager.
now,
even
the
government’s
key
witness,
cecil
elswick
and
it
was
he
who
testified
that
he
had
put
the
illegal
votes
on
the
machine.
he
was
very
careful
to
separate
byrd
and
hechler
from
the
hager
slate.
there
are
excerpts
from
elswick
testimony
of
the
government’s
brief
but
each
time
that
elswick
referred
to
byrd
and
hechler,
and
there
are
only
two
references,
your
honors,
in
the
2000-page
transcript.
he
speaks
of
helping
to
win
“for
the
okey
hager
slate”
and
for
byrd
and
hechler.
wholly
natural
because
hager,
the
red
hager
who
was
one
of
the
defendants
in
this
case
also
happen
to
be
the
county’s
democratic
executive,
head
of
the
counties,
chairman
of
the
county
democratic
executive
committee.
now,
we
simply
invite
the
court
to
examine
the
government’s
transcript
references.
none
of
them
we
believe,
we’ve
examined
them,
all
supports
the
governments
conclusion
that
the
hager
slate
included
byrd
and
hechler
or
that
this
conspiracy
was
in
anyway
directed
toward
byrd
and
hechler.
now,
let’s
take
at
look
what
happened
at
the
trial.
what
was
the
government’s
theory
at
the
trial
below
in
the
district
court
before
judge
field.
now,
again,
although
the
indictment
included
a
reference
to
federal
officials
indicated
in
the
text
of
the
indictment,
the
case
was
tried
in
the
district
court
as
a
conspiracy
to
secure
the
democratic
nomination
for
county
commissioner
for
okey
hager.
the
assistant
us
attorney
in
his
opening
statement
made
this
clear.
he
repeated
this
again
in
his
closing
statement
and
then
when
the
case
came
up
to
the
fourth
circuit,
the
fourth
circuit
concluded
“the
true
object
and
purpose
of
the
alleged
conspiracy
was
to
secure
the
democratic
nomination
of
okey
hager
as
county
judge.”
now
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
f
the
government
had
proved
its
case,
both
as
against
the
state
and
the
federal
officials,
it
had
proved
any
case
against
the
federal
officials,
yes,
your
honor,
we
would
not
be
making
this
argument.
mr.
david
ginsburg
we
indicated
that
in
our
brief.
mr.
david
ginsburg
he
was
indeed
but
there
was
no
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
would
hope
so
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
absolutely
and
i
would
hope
so
that
it
would
suppose
that
what
this
man
did
was
to
go
out,
that
is
hager,
red
hager
as
county
chairman,
go
out
to
seek
support
for
his
candidates.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no,
but
not
for
this
purpose.
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
record,
mr.
chief
justice
that
there’s
on
--
that
indicates
that
the
conspiracy
was
directed
to
the
federal
officers.
they
had
only
one
interest.
this
was
the
county
chairman’s
job
which
was
a
very
important
job
in
that
county
control
patronage.
it
was
a
job
that
was
very
considerable
importance
in
logan
county
and
this
was
the
subject
of
the
conspiracy
not
in
anyway,
so
far
as
the
record
indicates
anything
having
to
do
with
byrd
and
hechler.
and
as
i
said
before,
it
would
have
been
a
nonsense
for
these
people
to
proceed
to
try
to
setup
a
single
precinct
in
a
large
county
for
a
man
running
statewide.
it
didn’t
happen,
couldn’t
have
happened,
there
is
a
practical
political
matter.
now,
what
did
the
fourth
circuit
do
with
this
case?
on
the
authority
of
price
and
guess,
it
affirmed.
now,
the
fourth
circuit
found
that
section
241,
and
we’re
presenting
to
the
court
an
issue
of
interpretation,
covered
the
fourteenth
amendment
rights
including
voting
rights
protected
by
the
equal
protection
clause.
in
effect,
the
fourth
circuit
held
that
in
a
primary
where
federal
officers
were
also
on
the
ballot,
a
conspiracy
to
cast
fraudulent
ballot
for
state
office
in
which
state
election
officials
take
part,
results
in
the
denial
of
equal
protection
and
violates
section
241
even
though
the
conspiracy
was
not
directed
against
federal
office,
that’s
the
issue
as
we
see
it.
and
this
is
the
first
case
we
find
that
has
--
of
this
sort
has
come
before
the
court.
now,
the
question
i’m
raising
and
we’ll
consider
now
is
whether
section
241
does
cover
state
voting
frauds.
now,
the
history
of
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
would
certainly
agree
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
the
article
1
sections
2
and
4,
your
honor.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes
this
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
the
court
has
ruled
on
this
issue
and
it
seems
to
me
clear
and
separate.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
david
ginsburg
oh,
i
think
the
court
has
dealt
with
this
before
in
classic
and
before
classic
and
in
saylor.
mr.
david
ginsburg
it
would,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no.
mr.
david
ginsburg
exactly
so,
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
exactly
right
and
this
is
what
i’m
proceeding
to.
consider
the
fourteenth
amendment
aspect
of
section
241
as
contrasted
with
the
article
1
sections
2
and
4
aspect
of
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
exactly.
now,
this
is
a
well-plowed
field
as
the
questioning
has
already
indicated
and
every
lawyer
who's
read
the
decisions
knows
that
this
field
is
also
well-mined.
now,
obviously
the
congress
didn’t
intend
the
1870
act
to
apply
to
non-federal
elections
unless
some
form
of
racial
discrimination
was
involved.
indeed
it
was
convinced
in
1870
and
the
history
has
shown
in
many
decision
of
this
court
at
that
time
the
congress
had
felt
that
the
court
--
the
congress
felt
that
it
had
no
constitutional
authority
in
this
field.
but
today,
we
do
not
question
the
existence
of
constitutional
authority.
the
question
we’re
submitting
to
this
court
is
whether
without
congressional
sanction
section
241
should
now
by
interpretation
of
this
court,
be
extended
to
cover
the
federal
policing
of
state
and
local
elections
where
racial
discrimination
is
not
shown
and
it’s
not
an
issue.
that
i
believe
is
a
central
issue
in
this
case.
now,
so
far
in
my
view,
your
honor,
the
courts
could
extend
guest
and
price
to
cover
anderson
although
the
indictment
and
the
record
in
this
particular
case
would
i
think
present
the
court
with
troublesome
problems
that
i’ll
come
to
in
a
moment.
we
urge
however
that
the
court
leave
the
decision
on
federal
policing
of
state
and
local
elections
to
the
states
and
to
the
congress
where
again
racial
bias
is
not
shown.
there’s
ample
legal
justification
for
it.
the
congress
has
considered
this
matter
many
times
before,
most
recently
i
think
in
1957
and
1964
and
again
in
the
voting
rights
act
of
1965.
the
legislative
history
is
fully
set
forth
in
our
brief.
there’s
no
need
for
the
court
to
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
into
this
area
which
so
far
has
been
reserved
to
the
states.
the
authority
which
the
government
now
seeks
from
this
court
for
its
prosecuting
attorneys
has
been
deliberately
and
consistently
withheld
by
the
congress
and
it’s
peculiarly
the
kind
of
authority
which
lends
itself
to
partisan
and
even
geographically
discriminatory
political
direction.
the
states
we
submit
must
be
given
a
full
opportunity
to
come
to
grips
with
these
issues
of
corruption.
we’ve
see
it
maryland,
we’ve
seen
that
in
new
jersey
what’s
been
happening
and
even
in
west
virginia
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor.
a
state
grand
jury
had
been
called
and
had
come
in
to
session
and
it
was
the
us
attorney
as
we
understand
it
who
asked
that
the
state
grand
jury
not
be
convened
and
warned
that
if
it
were
convened,
the
government
would
seek
an
injunction
to
stop
it.
now,
let
me
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
indictment.
again,
paragraph
nine
of
the
indictment
charged
to
the
defendants
with
the
conspiracy
to
injure
the
qualified
voters
of
logan
county
by
denying
them
the
right
to
have
their
votes
fully
counted,
by
having
their
votes
diluted.
defendants
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictment
and
the
motion
was
denied
on
the
ground
that
the
indictment
adequately
charged
the
defendants
under
section
241.
at
trial,
the
government
sought
to
prove
a
conspiracy
that
had
at
its
object
not
the
office
of
senator
or
representative
but
county
commissioner.
the
indictment
didn’t
specify
the
state
or
county
office
which
was
the
object
of
the
conspiracy.
the
indictment
didn’t
suggest
that
the
five
defendants
or
their
three
co-conspirators
were
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
it
did
not
identify
the
separate
constitutional
rights
or
rights
which
were
allegedly
denied,
and
as
a
practical
matter,
it
failed
clearly
to
inform
the
defendants
of
the
charges
against
them
and
all
of
their
subsequent
motions
for
discovery
and
clarification
were
denied.
it
wasn’t
until
the
trial
began
that
the
defendants
and
their
counsels
first
learned
that
the
alleged
conspiracy
involved
the
state
office
and
it
wasn’t
until
the
fourth
day
of
trial
that
they
know
who
the
unnamed
co-conspirators
were
and
where
the
acts
took
place.
now,
the
deficiencies
--
well,
if
in
the
indictment
and
this
goes
to
a
point
of
the
question
mr.
justice
brennan
asked.
the
government
had
at
least
separated
the
two
alleged
offenses
in
separate
counts.
the
court
and
the
defendants
would
have
been
in
a
position
to
challenge
the
legal
sufficiency
of
section
241
and
its
application
to
state
and
county
offices
and
at
the
close
of
the
government
case
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
in
relation
to
the
federal
charge.
this
wasn’t
done.
here
the
government
was
in
the
enviable
position
of
being
able
to
defend
a
motion
to
dismiss
by
arguing
that
a
conspiracy
to
cast
fraudulent
votes
in
a
federal
election
clearly
stated
an
offense
under
section
241
and
then
proceed
to
try
the
case
on
the
basis
of
a
conspiracy
to
cast
votes
in
an
election
for
a
local
office
and
on
appeal
the
government
will
then
be
free
to
urge
affirmance
on
whatever
basis
that
felt
emerge
in
the
record.
mr.
david
ginsburg
we
did
move
to
dismiss,
your
honor.
it
was
overruled.
section
241
is
a
conspiracy
statute
which
required
no
overt
act
does
an
element
of
defense
i
don’t
have
to
bring
to
the
attention
of
this
court
the
kinds
of
problems
where
justice
jackson
dealt
with
and
described
in
his
separate
opinion
in
krulewitch.
this
indictment,
your
honor,
was
defective
and
it
wasn’t
cured
by
anything
by
the
evidence
brought
out
in
the
trial.
it
was
subsequently
and
substantially
defective
and
it
wasn’t
the
case
of
a
meeting
any
magic
or
talismanic
words.
it
simply
didn’t
frame
the
issues
which
already
been
be
framed
by
the
questions
of
this
court
but
there’s
still
another
problem,
that
the
government
fails
to
come
to
grips
with.
the
indictments
charged
that
the
defendants
conspired
to
dilute
votes
in
two
federal
officers.
this
gets
to
the
point
that
mr.
justice
brennan
inquired.
the
integrity
of
federal
elections
is
protected
as
indicated
by
sections
2
and
4
of
article
1,
the
integrity
of
state
and
local
elections
is
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
screws,
one
of
the
landmark
cases
of
the
court
in
this
area,
the
court
held
that
in
order
to
prevent
serious
doubts
about
unconstitutional
vagueness
in
section
242,
a
companion
statute,
we’re
dealing
here
with
241,
it
was
242
in
screws
where
the
term
willful
was
used.
the
term
willful,
this
court
said
in
that
section
must
be
construed
to
mean
a
purpose
to
deprive
a
person
of
a
specific
constitutional
right
and
then
it
said
that
that
issue
must
be
submitted
to
the
jury
under
appropriate
instructions.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i’ll
continue
--
i’ll
reserve
three
minutes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
ginsburg
we’re
dealing
here
with
an
alleged
voting
frauds
in
federal
and
state
elections
under
separate
constitutional
provisions
due
to
the
facts.
now,
under
screws
and
price
combined,
the
government
was
required
to
demonstrate
specific
intent
to
violate
each
of
these
provisions
and
the
court,
the
district
court,
was
required
to
submit
these
issues
to
the
jury
under
its
charge.
the
district
court
of
course
failed
to
do
that,
the
indictment
failed
to
separate
the
constitutional
provisions
and
no
such
charge
was
made.
now,
the
essential
problem
was
the
defect
in
the
indictment
and
that
obscurity
wasn’t
cleared
by
the
evidence
that
came
in
the
trial.
if
this
was
a
multiple
conspiracy,
as
the
government
contends,
then
neither
the
prosecutors
nor
lawyers
that
tried
the
case,
nor
the
district
court
that
heard
it
nor
the
fourth
circuit
that
reviewed
it,
appreciated
that
fact.
now,
i
have
one
final
point
and
that
is
on
the
matter
of
the
relief
we
have
requested.
under
a
very
broad
section
241
indictment,
the
government
security
conviction
on
the
assumption
that
this
court
had
already
ruled.
that
241
permits
the
government,
federal
government,
to
police
state,
the
voting
frauds
and
asking
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
below.
we’re
simply
asking
the
court
not
to
extend
the
jurisdiction
of
section
241
to
local
elections
where
no
racial
fraud
is
shown
but
we
do
recognize
in
this
in
response
to
questions
that
mr.
justice
white
and
mr.
justice
rehnquist
asked.
we
do
recognize
that
the
government
might
have
presented
evidence,
if
they
had
any,
under
the
same
indictment
showing
a
conspiracy
by
these
five
defendants
to
cast
fraudulent
votes
in
a
federal
election.
it
didn’t
do
so
but
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
government
should
now
be
given
a
chance
to
produce
such
evidence,
if
it
has
it,
then
we
urge
that
the
decision
below
be
reversed
on
the
issue
of
statutory
interpretation
and
remanded
for
trial
under
appropriate
instructions
on
the
federal
issue.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no,
your
honor.
the
indictment
failed
to
separate
these
two
constitutional
provisions
and
there
was
no
evidence
submitted
in
the
trial
on
the
federal
issue.
now,
our
position
is
that
the
government
is
entitled
to
its
day
in
court
if
it
has
such
evidence
and
the
case
can
be
sent
back
for
trial
on
the
federal
issue.
mr.
david
ginsburg
exactly
so,
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
your
honor,
let
me
be
perfectly
frank
with
this
court
that
it’s
quite
clear
that
these
issues
were
not
sought
to
be
brought
out
in
the
district
court.
the
case
was
tried
without
reference
to
it.
it
came
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
issue
wasn’t
briefed
in
the
court
of
appeals
on
oral
argument.
there
began
to
be
some
awareness
that
there
was
a
federal
issue
on
a
problem
of
a
statutory
interpretation
but
the
case
was
obscure
and
the
issue
has
been
finally
delineated
only
before
this
court.
mr.
david
ginsburg
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
essentially
for
this
court
as
far
as
we
been
able
to
analyze
the
case
and
the
record
as
you’ve
indicated
is
obscure
is
that
the
fourth
circuit
really
did
rule
on
the
issue
of
statutory
interpretation
and
it
did
hold,
it
extended
your
decisions
in
price.
mr.
david
ginsburg
we
failed
to
appreciate
that
point,
your
honor.
it’s
--
we
can’t
--there
was
the
it
--
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
issue
to
which
you
have
reference
arised
in
this
fashion.
there
was
an
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
federal
election
had
been
certified
15
days
after
the
recount
and
the
defendants
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals
early
that
after
the
federal
election
had
been
certified,
no
evidence,
what
had
happened
and
then
it
subsequent
investigation
should
have
been
introduced
and
the
court
overruled
that.
they
said,
“yes,
go
ahead”
and
they
introduced
that
evidence
but
the
essential
thrust
that
seems
to
us
as
we
read
the
decision
is
that
that
court
passed
on
the
issue
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
having
to
do
with
a
state
election
satisfied
--
fell
under
the
jurisdiction
of
section
241.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes
sir.
mr.
david
ginsburg
arguably?
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes.
mr.
david
ginsburg
if
the
evidence
was
improperly
introduced,
my
view
would
be
at
that
point
that
there
would
be
no
evidence
in
this
record
to
even
having
to
do
with
the
statement.
mr.
david
ginsburg
it
would
in
my
view
because
there
would
be
no
evidence
in
the
record.
this
is
the
essential
evidence
in
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
don’t
quarrel
with
that
analysis
as
we
see
the
case
at
the
moment,
the
government
at
least
as
the
case
has
presented
at
both
below
in
the
intermediate
court
and
here,
as
it
finally
reaches
here,
is
simply
that
a
federal
violation
was
charged
and
therefore
we
have
the
right
to
come
in
under
section
241.
we
say
that
a
state
voting
fraud
was
a
conspiracy
was
shown,
if
it
was
shown
there.
but
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
federal
election
and
that
the
statute
should
not
be
extended.
mr.
david
ginsburg
the
court,
your
honor,
until
now
has
refused,
deliberately
refused,
after
the
most
mature
consideration
to
extend
it
so
far.
if
it’s
done,
this
would
be
the
first
time
in
judicial
history
that
section
241
has
sought
to
be
applied.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no
doubt,
your
honor,
regarding
constitutional
power.
we
raised
no
question
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
section
5,
the
congress
can
clearly
reach
it
and
indeed
they
are
debating
it.
they
debated
it
over
the
past
10
years,
there
are
bills
pending
today
dealing
with
these
problems
and
there’s
no
doubt
too
that
the
state
could
deal
with
it
and
many
states
had
dealt
with
it
that
effectively.
the
issue
really
is
whether
this
section
should
now
by
interpretation
of
this
court
be
extended
without
the
sanction
or
prior
consideration
by
the
counsel.
mr.
david
ginsburg
exactly
right,
sir.
if
there's
racial
discrimination,
there’s
no
doubt
in
our
view.
we’re
not
urging
that
point
that
section
241,
in
our
view,
would
be
applicable.
mr.
david
ginsburg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
government
has
said
that
this
is
a
single
conspiracy
and
of
course
the
re-indictment
was
so
framed.
this
is
one
of
the
errors
in
the
government’s,
in
the
way
the
case
was
tried
below.
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
in
the
appendix
that
printed
page
854,
i’m
now
reading
from
the
government’s
closing
statement,
“in
the
summary
of
the
evidence
introduced
in
that
case,
i
think
from
the
evidence
that
mr.
kingley(ph),
you
can
conclude
by
now
that
the
theory
behind
the
government's
case
actually
is
that
this
vote
for
cast
encountered
by
going
through
the
contest
and
all
in
order
to
get
okey
hager
elected
to
the
county
court.
in
order
to
get
red
hager’s
father
elected
to
the
county
court
that
these
defendants
along
with
others
got
the
votes
cast
and
got
the
votes
counted
in
the
long
drawn
out
procedure
that
was
involved
over
there.
there
are
other
references
and
it
was
through
--
the
indictment
charged
a
federal
offense.
the
attempted
proof
was
a
conspiracy
to
get
okey
hager
elected
county
commissioner.
mr.
david
ginsburg
this
was
the
language,
mr.
justice
marshall,
to
which
i
had
reference
during
the
oral
argument.
i
pointed
out
specifically
and
this
was
clearly
understood
at
the
time
the
record
in
this
case
is
a
sociological
document
of
what
exists
in
logan
county,
west
virginia,
pages
six
and
seven.
and
one
case
for
the
okey
hager’s
slate
he
was
casting
vote
and
senator
byrd
and
hechler.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
was
putting
them
on
for
senator
byrd
and
ken
hechler
and
the
okey
hager
slate.
there
were
two.
the
point
was
that
they
were
all
for
ken
hechler.
they
were
all
for
senator
byrd
and
the
problem
was
did
this
conspiracy
direct
itself
to
hechler
and
byrd
or
was
it
limited
to
the
county
commissioner.
our
submission
on
the
record
of
this
case,
check
every
citation
that
the
government
has
given
to
you,
is
that
the
conspiracy
was
limited
to
this
job
of
county
commissioner.
had
nothing
to
do
with
byrd
and
hechler?
they
were
all
for
byrd
and
hechler
in
logan
county,
west
virginia,
95%
of
the
vote
went
for
them.
mr.
david
ginsburg
yes,
i
think
so,
sir.
because
as
we
read
the
court
of
appeals’
decision
to
which
we’ve
had
so
much
reference,
the
court
felt
apparently
as
we
do
here
that
the
submission
of
the
government
was
a
submission
of
a
case
on
the
basis
of
a
state
fraud
and
they
felt
it
necessary
to
extend
section
241
to
local-state
fraudulent
voting
issue.
just
on
the
issue
of
constitutional
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
just
on
the
issue
of
constitutional
power
there
is
no
question
of
ample
constitutional
power
to
deal
with
these
matters
whether
it
has
to
do
with
sexual
discrimination
or
the
kind
of
vote
frauds
that
dealt
within
this
case.
the
issue
is
whether
section
241
will
now
be
extended
by
this
court
into
this
area
on
this
record.
mr.
david
ginsburg
i
think
if
the
conspiracy,
my
position
would
be
the
same
on
the
record
on
this
case,
there’s
no
doubt
of
that.
because
the
conspiracy
that
was
shown
the
only
conspiracy
that
was
shown
under
section
241,
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
and
that
will
take
you
into
a
consideration
of
the
evidence
in
the
record,
and
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
we
can
find
is
that
when
these
people
talked
among
themselves
as
to
what
they
were
going
to
do,
they
were
talking
about
okey
hager
and
there
was
no
consideration,
no
discussion,
no
effort
to
direct
any
concerted
action
in
the
in
the
election
of
hechler
and
byrd.
mr.
david
ginsburg
well,
we’ve
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
mr.
justice
white,
we
have
played
with
this
necessary
and
probable
consequences
of
their
intended
act
and
we’ve
tried
to
analyze
it
in
those
terms
but
the
reality
is,
as
this
record
shows,
the
transcript,
the
2000
pages
of
it,
that
these
people
were
concerned
with
something
real
to
them
and
that
real
was
this
county
commissioner
judge.
mr.
david
ginsburg
no,
we
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
but
the
conspiracy
was
not
directed
against
the
--
for
federal
office.
the
only
conspiracy
that
was
shown
in
the
record
was
a
conspiracy
that
was
limited
to
the
local
office.
mr.
david
ginsburg
the
burden
of
proof
was
on
the
government
nothing
is
shown
of
that.
mr.
david
ginsburg
that
was
clearly
the
assumption
and
that
the
--
but
the
issues
with
which
they
were
dealing
--
the
only
issues
with
which
they
were
concerned
and
indeed
the
only
issue
that
was
involved
in
the
election
contest
was
what?
okey
hager
is
the
county
commissioner.
these
were
their
concerns.
they
had
no
concern
in
their
own
interest
in
the
problem
of
the
senate
or
the
house
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
well,
but
only
as
individuals
not
as
conspirators.
this
is
the
--
i
think
the
central
issue.
mr.
david
ginsburg
clearly
some
votes
were
cast
for
federal
office
by
man
named
elswick
who
actually
pulled
the
lever
--
mr.
david
ginsburg
he
was
a
member
of
the
--
one
of
the
conspiracy.
he
was
a
co-conspirator,
actually
not
a
defendant
with
given
immunity
in
this
case
and
the
issue
is
whether
he
took
his
instructions
from
hager
who
was
one
of
the
defendants
or
whether
he
took
this
instructions
from
conspirators
as
such.
