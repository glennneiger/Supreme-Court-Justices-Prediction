here

writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
petitioners
were
shown
to
have
conspired
to
cast
fictitious
votes
in
a
west
virginia
primary
election.
they
were
convicted
of
violating
section
241
of
title
18,
which
makes
it
unlawful
to
conspire
to
injure
any
of
the
citizen
in
the
pre-exercise
or
enjoyment
of
any
right
or
privilege
secured
by
the
constitutional
laws
of
the
united
states.
considering
the
immiscibility
of
certain
evidence
introduced
at
trial,
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
necessary
to
resolve
the
question
to
whether
section
241
encompassed
conspiracies
to
cast
false
ballots
in
purely
local
elections.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
have
concluded
that
the
evidence
and
question
was
immiscible
on
the
basic
principles
of
the
law
of
evidence
and
conspiracy.
and
since
the
evidence
at
trial
showed
that
petitioner's
conspiracy
to
encompass
the
casting
of
false
votes
for
candidates
for
federal
office
as
well
as
the
local
office,
the
conspiracy
was
unlawful
under
subtle
precedence
of
this
court.
we,
therefore,
affirm
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeals
which
had
affirmed
the
petitioner’s
convictions
without
passing
on
its
interpretation
of
241.
