justice

rehnquist
mr.
ginsburg,
when
you
say
the
record,
are
you
referring
to
the
evidence
actually
introduced
at
the
trial
or
to
the
evidence
and
the
indictment?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ginsburg,
if
the
government
had
proved
the
case,
it
alleged
in
its
indictment
in
paragraph
nine,
you
wouldn’t
be
making
the
same
arguments
as
you
now
make,
i
take
it.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
oregon
against
mitchell?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you’re
contending
that
that
would
make
ballot
stuffing
in
a
school
board
election
as
a
federal
offense
under
241?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
whether
one
thinks
there’s
a
need
for
that,
mr.
wallace,
on
the
basis
of
that
testimony
and
i
suppose
depends
one’s
view
on
the
federal
system
whether
every
time
you
find
a
corrupt
prosecuting
attorney
in
a
county
you
feel
that
the
federal
government
ought
to
step
in.
i
don’t
think
that’s
beyond
debate.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
you’re
right
in
that,
mr.
ginsburg,
can
you
raise
that
under
the
questions
you’ve
presented
in
your
petition?
