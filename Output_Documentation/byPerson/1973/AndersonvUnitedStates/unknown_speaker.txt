unknown

on
a
single
ballot?
unknown
speaker
at
what
page
of
the
appendix?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
can’t
you
move
for
judgment
of
the
acquittal
at
the
close
of
the
government’s
case
if
they
failed
to
approve
the
conspiracy
of
the
alleged
in
the
indictment?
unknown
speaker
then
your
real
quarrel
was
not
with
the
indictment
or
the
proof
adduced
in
the
support
of,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
that’s
not
the
only
evidence,
of
course,
under
your
submission
that
they
could
be
on
retrial?
unknown
speaker
mr.
ginsburg,
could
i
ask,
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals’
opinion
i
got
to
the
question
of
state
elections
and
said
that
241
--
and
said
that
241
covered
frauds
in
state
elections
because
of
an
equal
protections
rationale
but
they
felt
compelled
to
reach
that
question
because
of
admissibility
of
evidence
issue.
let’s
assume
that
this
court
said,
well
if
the
indictment
was
wholly
proper
because
of
the
federal
case,
federal
election
the
evidence,
then
the
conviction
would
have
been
proper
on
normal
circumstances
as
to
protect
the
federal
election
but
then
could
you
avoid
the
state
election
question
or
is
everything
tainted
by
the
fact
that
there
was
an
evidentiary
question
here,
admissibility
of
evidence
question.
unknown
speaker
but
it
did
so
in
the
name
of
passing
on
the
admissibility
of
evidence
question.
now
if
--
unknown
speaker
let’s
assume
that
the
court
was
wrong
on
its
construction
in
241
with
respect
to
state
elections.
unknown
speaker
then
i
take
it,
this
evidence
that
we’re
talking
about
arguably
was
inadmissible.
unknown
speaker
well,
let’s
assume
that
it
was
inadmissible.
unknown
speaker
that’s
an
independent
ground
for
reversal
of
the
convictions,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
[voice
overlap]
the
problem
under
this
argument
then
is
that
since
there
was
no
contest
over
the
votes
for
federal
officers,
federal
jurisdiction
on
a
conspiracy
ended
at
that
time
and
the
evidence
of
subsequent
events
at
a
contest
hearing
involving
only
a
state
office,
voted
on
at
the
same
election
was
accordingly
inadmissible.
let’s
assume
that
was
inadmissible,
would
that
require
that
the
conviction
be
reversed?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
federal
court
–
whether
they
could
have
convicted
your
clients
for
fraud
in
a
federal
election
is
dispositive
with
the
case
because
even
if
they
could
apparently
that
was
inadmissible
evidence
introduced.
if
the
court
was
wrong
on
the
241
--
unknown
speaker
how
about
--
you
will
mention
whether
you
have
to
reach
the
state
election
issue
based
on
this
evidence
question?
unknown
speaker
because
that
seems
to
be
the
way
the
courts
of
appeals
reach
that
question?
unknown
speaker
they
believe
that
admonition,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
so,
your
theory
then
is
that
if
the
conspiracy
embraced,
in
the
slightest
way,
the
casting
of
any
fraudulent
votes
for
federal
officer
that’s
enough
to
bring
it
under
241?
unknown
speaker
what
would
the
court
of
appeals,
you
probably
don’t
know
but
they
held
that
--
well,
then
arose
the
question
well
--
even
so
the
evidence
was
inadmissible
because
241
doesn’t
cover
state
election.
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
then
did
reach
the
constructions?
unknown
speaker
because
it
was
one
conspiracy.
unknown
speaker
what
should
we
do
if
the
court
was
wrong
in
that
deal
of
241.
i’m
not
saying
it
is
but
assuming
that
it’s
wrong?
unknown
speaker
then
we
have
to
remand
the
court
of
appeals
or
do
we
--
then
but
you
suggest
for
just
reached
the
single
conspiracy
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
do
you
submit
an
argument
for
against
the
court
of
appeals’
interpretation
of
241
as
reaching
local
--
unknown
speaker
there
must
have
been
a
problem
with
evidences.
this
argument
is
probably
made
by
court
of
appeals,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
but
you
must
have
made
the
same
argument
at
the
court
of
appeals
as
single
conspiracy.
the
court
of
appeals
didn’t--
unknown
speaker
they
would
offer
--
that
they
reached
a
much
more
difficult
complicated
questions,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
didn’t
want
to
give
in
the
merits
that.
i
just
wonder
what
the
court
of
appeals
must
have
thought
there
was
--
not
that
the
single
conspiracy
theory
wasn’t
so
sound
as
you
might
make
it
sound.
unknown
speaker
they
pass
but
they
don't
buy
that
--
unknown
speaker
neither
those
cases
deal
with
voting
and
state
election.
unknown
speaker
but
isn’t
it
the
question,
that
congress
intended
to
cover
by
241
not
enough
what
--
not
what
the
--
not
that
the
constitution
is
construed
to
that.
unknown
speaker
as
i
put
it,
except
--
if
they
have
said
except
voting
rights,
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
make
that
argument.
unknown
speaker
you
won’t
but
the
legislative
history
is
equivalent
to
an
exclusion.
unknown
speaker
was
mosley
a
federal
election?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
i
didn’t
understand
the
petitioner
to
say
that
241
would
not
be
applicable
to
a
federal
election.
can
you
elaborate
on
this?
maybe
i
misunderstood
what
you
just
said.
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
understand
that
he
does
not
say
that
241
applies
in
a
federal
election?
unknown
speaker
well,
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
the
prisoners’
counsel
would
speak
for
himself
but
i
understood
that
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
at
least,
he
had
acknowledged
that
a
conspiracy
to
frank
on
a
fraud
in
a
federal
election
would
be
covered
by
241
and
indeed
a
conspiracy
to
racially
discriminate
in
the
state
election
would
be
covered
but
--
unknown
speaker
he’ll
speak
for
--
unknown
speaker
he
does
say
that
i
understood
it
that
way
too.
he
does
--
unknown
speaker
how
about
--
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
power
to
protect
against
ballot
box
stuffing
in
the
state
election?
unknown
speaker
yes
but
he
agrees
in
federal
election,
--
unknown
speaker
but
you
still
don’t
think
it’s
necessary
for
us
to
reach
that
issue
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
we
do
have
to
dispose
of
that
evidentiary
question
--
would
you
suggest
we
don’t
do
it
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
did
but
on
another
ground?
unknown
speaker
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
ginsburg.
unknown
speaker
on
a
single
ballot?
unknown
speaker
at
what
page
of
the
appendix?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
can’t
you
