chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
the
73-346,
anderson
against
the
united
states.
mr.
ginsburg,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
was
there
any
impact
you
suggest
that
there
was
no
impact
whatever
was
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--
with
regards
to
the
federal
candidates?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now
you
indicated--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
suggested
a
moment
ago
that
the
county
chairman,
the
county
party
chairman
who
was
part
of
this
is
one
of
the
defendants?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
not
his
--
it
is
not
one
of
his
functions
to
see
to
it
that
the
incumbents
of
the
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
--party
get
the
nomination?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
but
the
problem
that
he
had
here
is
that
he
was
getting
support
in
another
way,
wasn’t
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
gray
against
sanders,
i
guess
had
something
to
do
with
that.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
resume
there
right
after
lunch.
mr.
ginsburg
are
you
trying
to
continue
or
reserve?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
very
well.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
this
is
not
exactly
the
position
that
was
taken
in
the
court
of
appeal,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
at
least
there
are
no
power
--
there
is
no
power
in
any
federal
statute
to
guarantee
the
integrity
of
a
state
election.
let’s
assume
you
had
an
off
year
election
and
there
were
no
federal
officers
on
the
ballot
at
all,
just
local,
is
there
--
doesn’t
the
statute
seek
to
protect
the
integrity
of
state
electoral
processes?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
was
speaking
of
power.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it’s
already
has
that
reach
if
there
were
any
discrimination
in
terms
of
voting.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
mr.
ginsburg,
we’ll
allow
you
your
three
minutes
rebuttal
and
adjust
all
the
time
accordingly.
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
under
the
statute
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
the
fraud
affects
the
outcome?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
fraudulent
effort
that
fails
is
just
as
much
a
crime
as
one
would
succeed?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
understand
that
you’re
saying
too
that
even
if
the
different
conspirators
had
different
priorities
in
terms
of
the
objective
that
they
were
trading
horses
in
effect
and
that
each
is
then
charged
with
the
total
action.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
have
to
go
that
far?
[voice
overlap]
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
do
you
have
to
go
that
far
in
view
of
the
testimony
that,
i
forgot
the
name
of
the
man
but
it’s
in
footnote
11.
it
was
for
the
slate
of
the
senator,
the
congressman,
and
local
slate.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
jury
had
a
right
to
believe
that
then
do
you
say
that
every
member
of
the
conspiracy
is
charged
with
that
testimony.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
take
it
mr.
wallace
that
if
in
a
local
election
on
hypothesis
of
mr.
justice
rehnquist’s
question.
in
a
local
election,
if
you
had
a
woman
candidate
and
the
man
who
were
in-charge
of
the
election
machinery
said,
agreed
among
themselves
that
they
were
only
going
to
count
one
in
three
of
the
woman’s
votes
on
the
assumption
that
they
were
all
going
to
--
most
of
them
would
vote
for
the
woman,
woman
candidate.
do
you
say
241
would
cover
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
ginsburg,
you
have
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
one
colloquy
in
footnote
11
or
12
would
seem
to
be
cutting
across
that
somewhat
where
the
man
said
he
was
assured
that
if
they
got
the
county
sheriff,
the
county
prosecutor,
and
the
county
judge
then
nothing
could
happen
to
them,
i.e.,
if
there
was
any
fraud
beyond
that,
all
the
people
in
the
state
level,
the
local
levels
to
deal
with
these
problems
were
their
men.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
some
of
them
did
made
their
testimony.
