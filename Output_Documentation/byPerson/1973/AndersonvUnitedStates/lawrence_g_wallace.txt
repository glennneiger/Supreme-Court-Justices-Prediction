mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
questions
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case.
one
is
whether
section
241
of
title
18
applies
to
a
primary
elections
for
state
officers
and
the
other
is
whether
if
it
does
so
apply,
an
indictment
under
section
241
must
charge
state
action
or
action
under
color
of
state
law.
those
two
questions
were
both
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
are
properly
before
the
court
and
we
have
argued
that
they
were
correctly
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
but
we
also
advance
an
argument
that
the
court
of
appeals
need
not
have
reach
those
issues
and
this
court
need
not
reach
the
issues
because
the
case
involved
the
casting
of
fraudulent
votes
in
a
state
election
--
in
a
federal
as
well
as
the
state
election.
there
were
some
other
arguments
advanced
with
respect
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
or
with
respect
to
the
charges
to
the
jury
that
in
our
view
are
not
comprised
within
those
questions
presented
and
are
not
properly
before
the
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
will,
your
honor
and
i’ll
be
getting
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
undoubtedly
was
delayed.
the
court
of
appeals
reached
the
issue
of
241’s
applicability
to
state
elections
but
we
think
unnecessarily
under
the
court
of
appeals
own
rulings.
now,
contrary
to
one
remark
made
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
the
government’s
theory
in
this
case
is
not
that
they
were
two
conspiracies.
in
our
view
the
entire
case
was
tried
and
the
indictment
charged,
a
theory
of
the
single
conspiracy
to
cast
and
have
counted
fraudulent
votes
for
candidates
running
for
the
federal
and
state
offices
in
the
may
19,
1970
west
virginia
primary.
no
distinction
was
made
by
either
the
government
or
the
defense
between
the
federal
and
state
offices
during
the
entire
course
of
the
trial
from
beginning
to
end.
as
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
itself
points
out,
that
issue
first
was
brought
into
the
case
in
course
of
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
we
think
the
evidence
as
well
as
the
allegations
shows
that
the
conspiracy
embraced
the
casting
of
false
votes
for
federal
officers.
we
had
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
the
statement
on
pages
six
and
seven
of
our
brief
in
a
lengthy
footnote,
footnote
number
11,
the
most
relevant
portions
of
the
evidence
dealing
with
the
reach
of
the
conspiracy
to
the
casting
of
fraudulent
votes
for
the
federal
officers.
cecil
elswick
who
was
the
witness
during
this
part
of
trial
was
testifying
about
his
activities
and
he
is
the
one
who
did
the
actual
casting
of
the
fraudulent
votes
in
the
mount
gay
precinct
and
his
testimony
recounted
on
page
six.
when
he
was
asked
what
the
petitioner
hager
asked
him
to
do
and
bringing
him
under
the
conspiracy,
he
answered
that,
“he
wanted
me
to
go
along
with
them
and
if
i
didn’t,
he
would
cause
me
trouble.
he
was
a
deputy
sheriff”,
the
petitioner
hager.
to
detail
you
what
he
meant
by
going
along
with
them
and
they
answered
go
along
and
help
win
the
mount
gay
precinct
on
election.
they
questioned
“for
whom?”
and
answered,
“for
the
okey
hager’s
slate
and
senator
byrd
and
ken
hechler”
that
was
when
mr.
elswick
was
brought
in
to
the
conspiracy
and
as
the
chief
justice
suggested,
the
record
does
show
that
petitioner
hager
was
the
chairman
of
the
democratic
county
committee
and
he
may
well
have
had
an
interest
in
maximizing
the
votes
for
the
federal
candidates
as
well
as
for
his
father
who
was
running
in
the
most
hotly
contested
elections.
then
the
testimony
goes
on,
on
page
seven
as
that
footnote
continues,
cecil
elswick
testified
that
he
in
fact
put
fraudulent
votes
on
the
ballots
at
mount
gay
for
the
federal
officials.
“mr.
elswick,
did
you
put
any
illegal
votes
on
those
machines
that
day?”
“yes
sir,
we
did.”
“how
many?”
“i
lost
count
at
about
90
it
was
over
a
hundred.
i
lost
count
that
evening,
i
only
more
on
after
i
lost
count,
so
it
was
over
a
hundred
votes.”
“who
were
you
putting
those
votes
on
there
for?”
“i
was
putting
them
on
there
for
senator
byrd
and
ken
hechler
and
okey
hager
slate
before
i
count”
etcetera.
and
the
evidence
shows
mathematically
as
its
recounted
on
page
eight
of
our
brief
that
fraudulent,
false,
fictitious
votes
were
in
fact
cast
for
the
federal
candidates
or
votes
were
cast
for
each
senator
byrd
and
congressman
hechler
and
there
were
voters
who
could
have
possibly
voted
in
that
precinct
that
day.
there
is
also
on
page
seven
in
the
footnote,
references
in
the
record
to
the
byrd’s
slate
which
was
apparently
synonymous
with
the
hager
slate.
the
federal
candidates
where
opposed
in
that
election
as
the
figures
that
counsel
for
the
petitioner
gave
the
court
indicate.
they
received
a
high
percentage
but
not
100%
of
the
vote
in
that
primary.
then
we
have
here
a
situation
in
which
possibly
the
motivation,
the
motive
of
the
conspiracy
was
solely
to
win
the
election
for
the
county
in
a
court
office
that
was
at
state.
this
was
not
the
theory
of
the
defense,
there
was
nothing
introduced
in
evidence
at
the
trial
to
show
that
the
conspiracy
was
anything
other
than
a
conspiracy
to
cast
votes
for
the
federal
and
state
offices
and
indeed
it
would
be
inherently
incredible
to
think
that
they
could
conspire
to
stuff
more
than
100
ballots
in
a
precinct
of
this
size
for
the
state
offices
alone
because
it
would
be
so
conspicuous
and
so
likely
to
allows
suspicion
if
the
vote
was
that
much
less
for
the
well-known
federal
candidates.
again,
for
the
state
candidates
it
obviously,
it
would
not
be
an
effective
way
of
proceeding
and
there
is
some
indication
in
the
record
on
page
44
of
the
appendix
that
are
this
indeed
may
have
been
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
conspiracy
embraced
the
federal
officers
as
well
as
the
state
ones
and
mr.
elswick
testified
about
what
petitioner
browning
said
to
him
in
a
meeting,
concerning
what
was
to
be
done
at
the
mount
gay
precinct
and
the
question
there
on
page
44
about
six
or
seven
lines
down.
“you’ve
seen
mr.
browning
was
at
that
meeting?”
answer
“mr.
browning
was
at
that
meeting
and
when
we
walked
outside
to
the
door,
there
he
said
cecil,
put
them
on
there
but
don’t
put
enough
on
there
to
get
in
any
trouble”
he
meant
don’t
pull
all
the
registration
book
or
you
would
get
in
trouble
and
they
could
catch
it
easy.
well,
obviously
that
at
least
meant
not
to
cast
more
votes
than
they
were
possible
voters
in
the
precinct
but
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
[laughter]
he
may
not
have
anticipated
the
proof
that
would
be
offered
of
the
number
who
did
not
in
fact
vote
but
obviously,
there
were
more
than
a
hundred
votes
cast
for
the
state
offices
and
not
for
the
federal,
the
conspiracy
would
have
little
chance
of
succeeding.
and
so
the
entire
theory
of
the
case
was
that
this
was
the
single
conspiracy
which
involved
the
casting
of
fraudulent
votes
for
both
the
federal
and
state
offices
and
the
evidence
introduced
while
it
showed
that
it
also
tended
to
focus
a
great
deal
on
what
was
the
principal
contest
and
the
contest,
the
outcome
of
which
was
affected
by
the
votes
cast
at
this
precinct
because
countywide,
the
difference
between
the
vote
for
mr.
hager
and
the
vote
for
neal
scaggs,
his
opponent,
was
only
about
twenty-one
votes
and
more
than
one
hundred
fraudulent
votes
were
cast
for
mr.
hager
according
to
the
allegations
here
in
this
one
precinct.
this
was
enough
to
change
the
outcome.
this
was
the
dramatic
aspect
of
the
conspiracy
and
the
aspect
that
had
given
rise
to
subsequent
acts
on
the
part
of
the
conspirators
to
effectuate
the
counting
of
those
ballots
in
the
state
contest
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
does
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
cases
indicate
that
the
statute
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
even
if
the
purpose
was
not
to
affect
the
outcome
but
just
to
falsify
the
votes,
the
holdings
have
been
that
the
right
protected
of
voters
in
the
federal
election
is
to
an
accurate
count
and
to
have
their
votes
given
their
proper
effect
and
weight
in
the
election.
and
as
we
know,
in
political
life,
the
magnitude
of
victory
can
be
quite
important
in
determining
governmental
policies
where
even
if
they
don't
change
the
outcome
but
who
was
elected
to
office.
now,
the
evidentiary
question
to
which
mr.
justice
white
has
alluded,
arose
because
the
defendants
contended
at
the
trial
that
in
its
instructions
and
this
was
the
only
objection
made
to
the
trial
court’s
instructions
and
preserved
at
the
trial,
that
the
jury
should
have
been
instructed
to
disregard
all
evidence
of
acts
that
occurred
after
the
results
of
the
election
had
been
certified
approximately
a
week
after
the
election
date.
there
had
been
much
evidence
introduced
at
the
trial
concerning
the
contest
proceedings
about
the
results
in
the
county
of
court
raised.
all
of
which
occurred
after
the
certification
in
an
effort
to
upset
the
certification
for
the
state
office.
and
in
the
course
of
passing
on
whether
that
evidence
was
properly
admitted,
and
that
is
the
controversy
about
whether
evidence
was
improperly
admitted,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
properly
admitted
with
respect
to
the
conspiracy
charged
and
proved
confining
itself
to
the
conspiracy
for
the
state
offices
because
it
held
and
this
is
on
page
18a
of
the
appendix
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
because
it
held
that
the
true
object
in
purpose
of
the
conspiracy
charge,
so
far
as
this
question
is
concerned,
was
to
secure
the
democratic
nomination
for
okey
hager
as
county
judge
and
that
this
conspiracy
embraced
the
attempt
to
effectuate
these
returns
throughout
the
contest
proceedings
and
not
end
with
the
formal
certification
of
the
results
that
was
subject
to
being
undone
in
the
contest
proceeding.
so
that
the
evidence
that
had
been
introduced
concerning
the
continued
efforts
of
the
conspirators
in
furtherance
of
the
objective
of
the
conspiracy
after
the
formal
certification
was
properly
admissible
the
court
held.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
under
the
established
holdings
under
241.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that’s
right
and
at
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
time,
a
contention
was
made
that
the
casting
of
fraudulent
votes
for
the
federal
officers
constituted
something
separate
and
all
the
241
covered
and
that
--
as
to
that
conspiracy
if
it
could
be
deemed
a
separate
conspiracy,
the
certification
was
to
cut
off
for
possible
admission
of
evidence
because
no
contest
ensued
with
respect
to
the
federal
officers.
now,
this
was
the
first
time
that
any
suggestion
had
been
made
that
this
was
more
than
one
conspiracy.
every
indication
in
the
allegation
and
in
the
trial
was
that
it
was
a
single
conspiracy
to
cast
and
have
counted
votes
for
this
slate
of
candidates,
federal
and
state
alike.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
that
reason,
instead
of
holding
that
the
evidence
as
to
the
acts
of
the
conspirators
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
insofar
as
they
affected
only
the
state
returns
was
properly
admissible.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
it
was
one
conspiracy.
instead
of
reaching
that
issue
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
241
applies
to
a
conspiracy
just
to
affect
state
officers
anyway
to
cast
fraudulent
votes
for
state
officers
and
therefore
it
need
not
worry
about.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
think
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
would
suggest
that
this
is
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance
that
the
court
--
it’s
apparent
on
this
record
that
this
is
a
single
conspiracy,
an
identical
issue
really
except
it
didn’t
involve
the
time
gap
that
was
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
do
submit
an
argument
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
correctly
and
that’s
our
alternative
contention
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
conspiracy
embraced
the
casting
of
fraudulent
votes
as
one
of
its
objectives
for
the
federal
officers
even
though
the
motive
may
have
been
solely
to
get
okey
hager
elected
to
the
county
court,
the
fact
that
the
conspiracy
embraced
the
casting
of
false
votes
with
the
federal
officers
is
enough
under
this
court’s
decision
in
the
ingram
case
for
federal
jurisdiction
to
apply
without
reaching
the
question
whether
the
statute
reaches
the
conspiracy
to
affect
the
state
offices,
that
aspect
of
the
conspiracy
and
surely
it’s
of
no
moment
to
obvious
federal
interest
why
it
is
that
more
than
a
hundred
false
votes
were
cast
in
the
federal
election
for
the
federal
officers.
we
analogize
it
in
our
brief
to
the
conspiracy
to
rob
a
federally
ensured
bank.
it’s
just
as
this
much
a
crime
regardless
of
what
it
is
that
the
conspirators
were
intending
to
use
the
proceeds
for.
and
we
see
no
difference
here
that
their
motive
may
have
been
only
to
affect
the
outcome
of
the
state
election,
and
they
were
for,
they
were
conspiring
to
falsify
the
federal
election.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that’s
what
the
[voice
overlap]
hold.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
what
we’re
relying.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
it
was
a
single
conspiracy
to
falsify
returns
for
that
slate
in
that
one
primary.
the
casting
and
the
counting
was
all
done
in
the
one
primary
for
the
one
slate
of
candidates.
we
don’t
see
how
this
is
really
separable
into
more
than
one
conspiracy.
the
suggestions
that’s
made
is
that
really
they
did
it
with
respect
to
the
federal
officers
only
to
subserve
their
purpose
to
win
for
the
county
clerk
post
which
really
intertwines
it
into
one
conspiracy
in
their
contention
as
well
as
we
understand
their
contention.
we
don’t
see
how
there
is
a
separate
conspiracy
here
at
least,
no
one
has
raised
that
defense
and
so
under
the
court
of
appeals
on
holding
we
think
the
evidence
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
arose
on
an
oral
argument
for
the
first
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
didn’t
pass
on
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
not
so
difficult
after
what
this
court
set
in
price.
in
price,
the
court
unanimously
held
that
241
applies
to
all
federal
constitutional
rights.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
have
not
read
the
transcript
of
the
oral
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals.
i
really
don’t
know
to
what
extent
these
issues
have
been
clarified
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that’s
the
way
they
chose
to
decide
the
case
and
it’s
quite
understandable
because
in
addition
to
the
passages
that
we
cite
from
guest
and
price,
there
was
in
price
another
passage
which
is
very
indicative
of
this
holding
and
that’s
on
page
805
of
the
383
us
in
which
the
court
holds,
“we
cannot
doubt
that
the
purpose
and
effect
of
section
241
--
purpose
and
effect
of
section
241
was
to
reach
assaults
upon
rights
under
the
entire
constitution
including
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth,
and
fifteenth
amendments
and
not
merely
under
part
of
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
immediately
neither
of
those
cases
dealt
with
that
precise
issue
but
immediately
before
that
sentence,
there’s
a
footnote
saying
in
this
historical
context
in
the
text,
“it
is
hardly
conceivable
that
congress
intended
section
241
to
apply
only
to
a
narrow
and
relatively
unimportant
category
of
rights.”
and
then
the
footnote
cites
among
other
cases,
for
example,
united
states
v.
classic
parenthetical
right
to
vote
in
federal
elections.
it’s
quite
obvious
that
the
reasoning
was
that
241
embraces
more
than
that
as
it
was
the
reasoning
from
the
mosley
case
through
the
others
under
section
241
that
have
dealt
with
voting
rights.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
although
congress
in
1870,
may
have
had
a
limited
conception
of
the
federal
constitutional
protection
of
voting
rights,
this
has
been
expanded
enormously
since
that
statute
was
enacted.
not
only
by
interpretations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
by
other
amendments
to
the
constitution
including
the
seventeenth
amendment
providing
for
direct
election
of
senators.
the
nineteenth
amendment

wallace
that
is
what
the
court
addressed
in
all
of
these
cases
and
decided
in
mosley
and
in
price
and
in
the
cases
in
between,
that
241
was
broadly
written
in
generic
terms
to
cover
not
only
the
rights
that
then
existed
but
all
rights
that
may
come
into
fruition
under
the
constitution
including
the
rights
under
the
nineteenth
amendment,
the
rights
under
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
and
under
the
twenty-sixth
amendment
and
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
they
had
put
exemption
in
of
course
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
issue
was
thoroughly
mooted
in
the
majority
and
dissenting
opinions
in
mosley,
in
classic,
and
in
saylor.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
has
disposed
of
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
contrary
to
what
the
petitioners’
counsel
contends
that
there’s
no
need
for
this.
this
record
itself
suggests
that
there
is
in
need
for
this
on
page
31
of
the
appendix
in
which
the
testimony
was
about
what
the
false
story
was
to
be
in
this
state
proceedings
which
as
we’ve
noted
came
to
not
in
this
case,
these
votes
were
not
thrown
out
in
the
state
proceedings.
the
bottom
of
page
31,
the
question
was,
“did
they
tell
you
what
the
story
was
to
be?”
answer,
“well,
like
garret
sullins’
voting
for
one
thing
and
if
we
would
stick
together
in
telling
falsehoods
about
this,
that
we
would
could
not
be
convicted
of
nothing
because
we
had
the
county
court,
the
judge,
and
the
prosecuting
attorney,
and
the
sheriff.”
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
may
not
be
beyond
debate
but
the
holdings
of
what
241
means
is
that
there
is
federal
protection
for
the
constitutional
rights
of
individuals
under
the
federal
constitution
and
certainly
one
of
the
most
important
of
those
rights
is
not
to
have
his
vote
diluted
improperly.
this
has
been
the
whole
thrust
of
the
series
of
reapportion
in
cases
addressed
an
improper
dilution
of
ones
voted
certainly
and
certainly
am
improper
dilution
to
cancel
it
out
through
ballot
box
stuffing
and
in
effect
make
it
a
half
vote
or
a
third
of
the
vote.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
say
it
would
cover
it
and
the
petitioner's
theory
is
that
it
would
not
cover
it
even
in
a
federal
election
because
the
congress
that
enacted
241
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
nineteenth
amendment
that
it
did
not
have
power
to
protect
against
sex
discrimination.
the
same
thing
would
be
true
about
the
poll
tax
that
is
protected
against
in
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
and
the
18-year
old
vote
that
the
twenty-sixth
amendment
affords
protection
for.
the
court
in
this
whole
series
of
cases
for
mosley
through
price
and
guest
has
rejected
the
idea
that
241
which
is
written
in
generic
terms
to
apply
all
of
these
rights
has
frozen
the
constitutional
rights
protected
to
those
that
existed
in
1870.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mosley
was
a
federal
election,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
ballot
box
stuffing
in
a
federal
election,
that
is
correct
and
that
is
his
theory,
that
that
could
be
protected,
ballot
box
stuffing
or
racial
discrimination
in
a
federal
or
state
election.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
be
the
sex
discrimination.
well,
the
old
holdings
were
that
241
did
not
apply
under
the
bathgate
case
in
a
federal
election
to
bribery
of
voters
and
that
was
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
principal
issue
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
something
that
the
court
would
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
did
not.
my
understanding
of
his
theory
is
that
241
must
be
interpreted
in
light
of
the
powers,
the
congress
thought
it
had
in
1870
and
if
congress
at
that
time
thought
it
could
not
protect
against
sex
discrimination
in
federal
or
state
election
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
and
241
wouldn’t
cover
it.
that
inquiry
would
have
to
be
made.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
he’s
not
asking
the
court
to
overrule
saylor
and
saylor
was
a
direct
holding
on
that
point
but
it
does
cover
ballot
box
stuffing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
federal
elections.
that’s
right.
i
don’t
want
to
make
his
contention
for
him
and
say
what
it
is
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
theory
of
his
case
as
i
understand
it
because
there’s
no
other
basis
on
which
he
is
asking
the
limitation
of
241
and
i
don’t
see
any
other
basis
after
price
and
guest
in
which
he
can
ask
for
a
limitation
of
241.
his
theory
has
to
be
that
it’s
limited
to
what
congress
thought
it
had
the
right
to
protect
against
in
1870.
it
seems
to
us,
the
holding
in
guest,
the
holding
in
guest
rejects
that
theory
because
at
that
time
it
was
even
before
plessy
against
ferguson
had
been
decided
but
that
certainly
was
the
governing
principle
of
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
at
that
time
and
yet
the
holding
in
guest
was
that
in
a
series
of
cases
beginning
with
brown
against
board
of
education
another
constitutional
principle
had
come
in
to
prevail
and
was
embraced
within
the
protection
of
section
241.
so,
i
don’t
think
that
this
necessarily
seem
like
the
more
difficult
issue
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
seemed
to
them
like
something
that
had
been
decided
in
guest
and
price
and
we
agree
with
them
that
the
essential
thrust
guest
and
price
is
that
241
applies
to
these
rights.
this
was
thoroughly
considered
at
the
time,
241
had
given
the
court
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
in
a
unanimous
opinion
in
price,
the
court
concluded
that
241
does
apply
all
rights
under
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth,
and
fifteenth
amendments
italicizing
all
in
the
court’s
opinion
as
well
as
to
all
other
constitutional
rights.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
see
no
need
for
because
they
decided
cases
involving
voting
frauds
under
241
seems
to
us,
show
that
the
statute
protects
against
falsifying
elections
for
federal
offices
in
the
manner
that
it
was
done
here
and
we
don’t
think
there
was
any
ambiguity
even
about
whether
this
was
all
one
conspiracy
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes
that
you
can
nearly
hold
--
the
court
of
appeals
did
hold
that
the
evidence
with
respect
to
the
contest
proceedings
was
properly
admissible
here
because
the
conspiracy
lasted
this
long
even
though
there
was
no
longer
any
contest
about
the
federal
officers
and
our
submission
is
that
that
holding
was
correct
as
far
as
it
went
and
suffices
to
uphold
this
conviction.
this
is
exactly
the
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
had
before
it
in
a
case
called
devoe
against
the
united
states
which
is
cited
in
the
footnote
at
the
very
bottom
of
page
15
of
our
brief.
a
case
back
in
103
f.2d
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
had
to
say
in
that
case
was
the
government’s
evidence.
i’m
quoting
from
page
588
now
at
103
f.2d,
“the
government’s
evidence
was
not
at
any
time
directed
towards
showing
the
existence
of
a
number
of
separate
and
distinct
conspiracies
but
was
directed
toward
showing
one
general
conspiracy
which
contemplated
in
part
a
false
count
and
a
false
certification
of
the
ballots
cast
for
the
congressional
candidates.
so
much
of
the
conspiracy
has
constituted
a
violation
of
the
federal
law
was
a
part
of
the
general
plan
or
scheme
of
those
engaged
in
the
conspiracy.
the
contention
of
the
government
should
have
been
limited
in
its
proof
to
only
so
much
of
the
evidence
as
directly
bore
upon
the
portion
of
the
conspiracy
which
constituted
the
violation
of
federal
law
is
we
think
unsound.”
and
that
is
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
present
case
could
have
used
the
exact
same
language
in
disposing
off
the
case
without
reaching
the
issue
whether
241
applies
to
a
conspiracy
that
do
not
involve
the
casting
of
fraudulent
votes
for
the
federal
officers.
so,
we
think
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed
on
either
of
these
grounds.
we
leave
to
our
brief
the
discussion
of
the
adequacy
of
the
indictment
to
alleged
action
under
color
of
law
if
the
court
reaches
that
issue.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
there
are
two
questions
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case.
one
is
whether
section
241
of
title
18
applies
to
a
primary
elections
for
state
officers
and
the
other
is
whether
if
it
does
so
apply,
an
indictment
under
section
241
must
charge
state
action
or
action
under
color
of
state
law.
those
two
questions
were
both
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
are
properly
before
the
court
and
we
have
argued
that
they
were
correctly
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
but
we
also
advance
an
argument
that
the
court
of
appeals
need
not
have
reach
those
issues
and
this
court
need
not
reach
the
issues
because
the
case
involved
the
casting
of
fraudulent
votes
in
a
state
election
--
in
a
federal
as
well
as
the
state
election.
there
were
some
other
arguments
advanced
with
respect
to
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
or
with
respect
to
the
charges
to
the
jury
that
in
our
view
are
not
comprised
within
those
questions
presented
and
are
not
properly
before
the
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
will,
your
honor
and
i’ll
be
getting
to
that
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
undoubtedly
was
delayed.
the
court
of
appeals
reached
the
issue
of
241’s
applicability
to
state
elections
but
we
think
unnecessarily
under
the
court
of
appeals
own
rulings.
now,
contrary
to
one
remark
made
by
counsel
for
the
petitioner,
the
government’s
theory
in
this
case
is
not
that
they
were
two
conspiracies.
in
our
view
the
entire
case
was
tried
and
the
indictment
charged,
a
theory
of
the
single
conspiracy
to
cast
and
have
counted
fraudulent
votes
for
candidates
running
for
the
federal
and
state
offices
in
the
may
19,
1970
west
virginia
primary.
no
distinction
was
made
by
either
the
government
or
the
defense
between
the
federal
and
state
offices
during
the
entire
course
of
the
trial
from
beginning
to
end.
as
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
itself
points
out,
that
issue
first
was
brought
into
the
case
in
course
of
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
we
think
the
evidence
as
well
as
the
allegations
shows
that
the
conspiracy
embraced
the
casting
of
false
votes
for
federal
officers.
we
had
set
forth
in
our
brief
in
the
statement
on
pages
six
and
seven
of
our
brief
in
a
lengthy
footnote,
footnote
number
11,
the
most
relevant
portions
of
the
evidence
dealing
with
the
reach
of
the
conspiracy
to
the
casting
of
fraudulent
votes
for
the
federal
officers.
cecil
elswick
who
was
the
witness
during
this
part
of
trial
was
testifying
about
his
activities
and
he
is
the
one
who
did
the
actual
casting
of
the
fraudulent
votes
in
the
mount
gay
precinct
and
his
testimony
recounted
on
page
six.
when
he
was
asked
what
the
petitioner
hager
asked
him
to
do
and
bringing
him
under
the
conspiracy,
he
answered
that,
“he
wanted
me
to
go
along
with
them
and
if
i
didn’t,
he
would
cause
me
trouble.
he
was
a
deputy
sheriff”,
the
petitioner
hager.
to
detail
you
what
he
meant
by
going
along
with
them
and
they
answered
go
along
and
help
win
the
mount
gay
precinct
on
election.
they
questioned
“for
whom?”
and
answered,
“for
the
okey
hager’s
slate
and
senator
byrd
and
ken
hechler”
that
was
when
mr.
elswick
was
brought
in
to
the
conspiracy
and
as
the
chief
justice
suggested,
the
record
does
show
that
petitioner
hager
was
the
chairman
of
the
democratic
county
committee
and
he
may
well
have
had
an
interest
in
maximizing
the
votes
for
the
federal
candidates
as
well
as
for
his
father
who
was
running
in
the
most
hotly
contested
elections.
then
the
testimony
goes
on,
on
page
seven
as
that
footnote
continues,
cecil
elswick
testified
that
he
in
fact
put
fraudulent
votes
on
the
ballots
at
mount
gay
for
the
federal
officials.
“mr.
elswick,
did
you
put
any
illegal
votes
on
those
machines
that
day?”
“yes
sir,
we
did.”
“how
many?”
“i
lost
count
at
about
90
it
was
over
a
hundred.
i
lost
count
that
evening,
i
only
more
on
after
i
lost
count,
so
it
was
over
a
hundred
votes.”
“who
were
you
putting
those
votes
on
there
for?”
“i
was
putting
them
on
there
for
senator
byrd
and
ken
hechler
and
okey
hager
slate
before
i
count”
etcetera.
and
the
evidence
shows
mathematically
as
its
recounted
on
page
eight
of
our
brief
that
fraudulent,
false,
fictitious
votes
were
in
fact
cast
for
the
federal
candidates
or
votes
were
cast
for
each
senator
byrd
and
congressman
hechler
and
there
were
voters
who
could
have
possibly
voted
in
that
precinct
that
day.
there
is
also
on
page
seven
in
the
footnote,
references
in
the
record
to
the
byrd’s
slate
which
was
apparently
synonymous
with
the
hager
slate.
the
federal
candidates
where
opposed
in
that
election
as
the
figures
that
counsel
for
the
petitioner
gave
the
court
indicate.
they
received
a
high
percentage
but
not
100%
of
the
vote
in
that
primary.
then
we
have
here
a
situation
in
which
possibly
the
motivation,
the
motive
of
the
conspiracy
was
solely
to
win
the
election
for
the
county
in
a
court
office
that
was
at
state.
this
was
not
the
theory
of
the
defense,
there
was
nothing
introduced
in
evidence
at
the
trial
to
show
that
the
conspiracy
was
anything
other
than
a
conspiracy
to
cast
votes
for
the
federal
and
state
offices
and
indeed
it
would
be
inherently
incredible
to
think
that
they
could
conspire
to
stuff
more
than
100
ballots
in
a
precinct
of
this
size
for
the
state
offices
alone
because
it
would
be
so
conspicuous
and
so
likely
to
allows
suspicion
if
the
vote
was
that
much
less
for
the
well-known
federal
candidates.
again,
for
the
state
candidates
it
obviously,
it
would
not
be
an
effective
way
of
proceeding
and
there
is
some
indication
in
the
record
on
page
44
of
the
appendix
that
are
this
indeed
may
have
been
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
conspiracy
embraced
the
federal
officers
as
well
as
the
state
ones
and
mr.
elswick
testified
about
what
petitioner
browning
said
to
him
in
a
meeting,
concerning
what
was
to
be
done
at
the
mount
gay
precinct
and
the
question
there
on
page
44
about
six
or
seven
lines
down.
“you’ve
seen
mr.
browning
was
at
that
meeting?”
answer
“mr.
browning
was
at
that
meeting
and
when
we
walked
outside
to
the
door,
there
he
said
cecil,
put
them
on
there
but
don’t
put
enough
on
there
to
get
in
any
trouble”
he
meant
don’t
pull
all
the
registration
book
or
you
would
get
in
trouble
and
they
could
catch
it
easy.
well,
obviously
that
at
least
meant
not
to
cast
more
votes
than
they
were
possible
voters
in
the
precinct
but
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
[laughter]
he
may
not
have
anticipated
the
proof
that
would
be
offered
of
the
number
who
did
not
in
fact
vote
but
obviously,
there
were
more
than
a
hundred
votes
cast
for
the
state
offices
and
not
for
the
federal,
the
conspiracy
would
have
little
chance
of
succeeding.
and
so
the
entire
theory
of
the
case
was
that
this
was
the
single
conspiracy
which
involved
the
casting
of
fraudulent
votes
for
both
the
federal
and
state
offices
and
the
evidence
introduced
while
it
showed
that
it
also
tended
to
focus
a
great
deal
on
what
was
the
principal
contest
and
the
contest,
the
outcome
of
which
was
affected
by
the
votes
cast
at
this
precinct
because
countywide,
the
difference
between
the
vote
for
mr.
hager
and
the
vote
for
neal
scaggs,
his
opponent,
was
only
about
twenty-one
votes
and
more
than
one
hundred
fraudulent
votes
were
cast
for
mr.
hager
according
to
the
allegations
here
in
this
one
precinct.
this
was
enough
to
change
the
outcome.
this
was
the
dramatic
aspect
of
the
conspiracy
and
the
aspect
that
had
given
rise
to
subsequent
acts
on
the
part
of
the
conspirators
to
effectuate
the
counting
of
those
ballots
in
the
state
contest
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
does
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
cases
indicate
that
the
statute
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
even
if
the
purpose
was
not
to
affect
the
outcome
but
just
to
falsify
the
votes,
the
holdings
have
been
that
the
right
protected
of
voters
in
the
federal
election
is
to
an
accurate
count
and
to
have
their
votes
given
their
proper
effect
and
weight
in
the
election.
and
as
we
know,
in
political
life,
the
magnitude
of
victory
can
be
quite
important
in
determining
governmental
policies
where
even
if
they
don't
change
the
outcome
but
who
was
elected
to
office.
now,
the
evidentiary
question
to
which
mr.
justice
white
has
alluded,
arose
because
the
defendants
contended
at
the
trial
that
in
its
instructions
and
this
was
the
only
objection
made
to
the
trial
court’s
instructions
and
preserved
at
the
trial,
that
the
jury
should
have
been
instructed
to
disregard
all
evidence
of
acts
that
occurred
after
the
results
of
the
election
had
been
certified
approximately
a
week
after
the
election
date.
there
had
been
much
evidence
introduced
at
the
trial
concerning
the
contest
proceedings
about
the
results
in
the
county
of
court
raised.
all
of
which
occurred
after
the
certification
in
an
effort
to
upset
the
certification
for
the
state
office.
and
in
the
course
of
passing
on
whether
that
evidence
was
properly
admitted,
and
that
is
the
controversy
about
whether
evidence
was
improperly
admitted,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
properly
admitted
with
respect
to
the
conspiracy
charged
and
proved
confining
itself
to
the
conspiracy
for
the
state
offices
because
it
held
and
this
is
on
page
18a
of
the
appendix
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
because
it
held
that
the
true
object
in
purpose
of
the
conspiracy
charge,
so
far
as
this
question
is
concerned,
was
to
secure
the
democratic
nomination
for
okey
hager
as
county
judge
and
that
this
conspiracy
embraced
the
attempt
to
effectuate
these
returns
throughout
the
contest
proceedings
and
not
end
with
the
formal
certification
of
the
results
that
was
subject
to
being
undone
in
the
contest
proceeding.
so
that
the
evidence
that
had
been
introduced
concerning
the
continued
efforts
of
the
conspirators
in
furtherance
of
the
objective
of
the
conspiracy
after
the
formal
certification
was
properly
admissible
the
court
held.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
under
the
established
holdings
under
241.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that’s
right
and
at
oral
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
time,
a
contention
was
made
that
the
casting
of
fraudulent
votes
for
the
federal
officers
constituted
something
separate
and
all
the
241
covered
and
that
--
as
to
that
conspiracy
if
it
could
be
deemed
a
separate
conspiracy,
the
certification
was
to
cut
off
for
possible
admission
of
evidence
because
no
contest
ensued
with
respect
to
the
federal
officers.
now,
this
was
the
first
time
that
any
suggestion
had
been
made
that
this
was
more
than
one
conspiracy.
every
indication
in
the
allegation
and
in
the
trial
was
that
it
was
a
single
conspiracy
to
cast
and
have
counted
votes
for
this
slate
of
candidates,
federal
and
state
alike.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
that
reason,
instead
of
holding
that
the
evidence
as
to
the
acts
of
the
conspirators
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
insofar
as
they
affected
only
the
state
returns
was
properly
admissible.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
it
was
one
conspiracy.
instead
of
reaching
that
issue
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
241
applies
to
a
conspiracy
just
to
affect
state
officers
anyway
to
cast
fraudulent
votes
for
state
officers
and
therefore
it
need
not
worry
about.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
think
that
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
would
suggest
that
this
is
an
alternative
ground
for
affirmance
that
the
court
--
it’s
apparent
on
this
record
that
this
is
a
single
conspiracy,
an
identical
issue
really
except
it
didn’t
involve
the
time
gap
that
was
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
do
submit
an
argument
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
correctly
and
that’s
our
alternative
contention
here.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
conspiracy
embraced
the
casting
of
fraudulent
votes
as
one
of
its
objectives
for
the
federal
officers
even
though
the
motive
may
have
been
solely
to
get
okey
hager
elected
to
the
county
court,
the
fact
that
the
conspiracy
embraced
the
casting
of
false
votes
with
the
federal
officers
is
enough
under
this
court’s
decision
in
the
ingram
case
for
federal
jurisdiction
to
apply
without
reaching
the
question
whether
the
statute
reaches
the
conspiracy
to
affect
the
state
offices,
that
aspect
of
the
conspiracy
and
surely
it’s
of
no
moment
to
obvious
federal
interest
why
it
is
that
more
than
a
hundred
false
votes
were
cast
in
the
federal
election
for
the
federal
officers.
we
analogize
it
in
our
brief
to
the
conspiracy
to
rob
a
federally
ensured
bank.
it’s
just
as
this
much
a
crime
regardless
of
what
it
is
that
the
conspirators
were
intending
to
use
the
proceeds
for.
and
we
see
no
difference
here
that
their
motive
may
have
been
only
to
affect
the
outcome
of
the
state
election,
and
they
were
for,
they
were
conspiring
to
falsify
the
federal
election.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that’s
what
the
[voice
overlap]
hold.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
what
we’re
relying.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
it
was
a
single
conspiracy
to
falsify
returns
for
that
slate
in
that
one
primary.
the
casting
and
the
counting
was
all
done
in
the
one
primary
for
the
one
slate
of
candidates.
we
don’t
see
how
this
is
really
separable
into
more
than
one
conspiracy.
the
suggestions
that’s
made
is
that
really
they
did
it
with
respect
to
the
federal
officers
only
to
subserve
their
purpose
to
win
for
the
county
clerk
post
which
really
intertwines
it
into
one
conspiracy
in
their
contention
as
well
as
we
understand
their
contention.
we
don’t
see
how
there
is
a
separate
conspiracy
here
at
least,
no
one
has
raised
that
defense
and
so
under
the
court
of
appeals
on
holding
we
think
the
evidence
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
arose
on
an
oral
argument
for
the
first
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
didn’t
pass
on
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
is
not
so
difficult
after
what
this
court
set
in
price.
in
price,
the
court
unanimously
held
that
241
applies
to
all
federal
constitutional
rights.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
have
not
read
the
transcript
of
the
oral
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals.
i
really
don’t
know
to
what
extent
these
issues
have
been
clarified
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that’s
the
way
they
chose
to
decide
the
case
and
it’s
quite
understandable
because
in
addition
to
the
passages
that
we
cite
from
guest
and
price,
there
was
in
price
another
passage
which
is
very
indicative
of
this
holding
and
that’s
on
page
805
of
the
383
us
in
which
the
court
holds,
“we
cannot
doubt
that
the
purpose
and
effect
of
section
241
--
purpose
and
effect
of
section
241
was
to
reach
assaults
upon
rights
under
the
entire
constitution
including
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth,
and
fifteenth
amendments
and
not
merely
under
part
of
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
immediately
neither
of
those
cases
dealt
with
that
precise
issue
but
immediately
before
that
sentence,
there’s
a
footnote
saying
in
this
historical
context
in
the
text,
“it
is
hardly
conceivable
that
congress
intended
section
241
to
apply
only
to
a
narrow
and
relatively
unimportant
category
of
rights.”
and
then
the
footnote
cites
among
other
cases,
for
example,
united
states
v.
classic
parenthetical
right
to
vote
in
federal
elections.
it’s
quite
obvious
that
the
reasoning
was
that
241
embraces
more
than
that
as
it
was
the
reasoning
from
the
mosley
case
through
the
others
under
section
241
that
have
dealt
with
voting
rights.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
although
congress
in
1870,
may
have
had
a
limited
conception
of
the
federal
constitutional
protection
of
voting
rights,
this
has
been
expanded
enormously
since
that
statute
was
enacted.
not
only
by
interpretations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
but
by
other
amendments
to
the
constitution
including
the
seventeenth
amendment
providing
for
direct
election
of
senators.
the
nineteenth
amendment
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
what
the
court
addressed
in
all
of
these
cases
and
decided
in
mosley
and
in
price
and
in
the
cases
in
between,
that
241
was
broadly
written
in
generic
terms
to
cover
not
only
the
rights
that
then
existed
but
all
rights
that
may
come
into
fruition
under
the
constitution
including
the
rights
under
the
nineteenth
amendment,
the
rights
under
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
and
under
the
twenty-sixth
amendment
and
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
they
had
put
exemption
in
of
course
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
issue
was
thoroughly
mooted
in
the
majority
and
dissenting
opinions
in
mosley,
in
classic,
and
in
saylor.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
court
has
disposed
of
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
contrary
to
what
the
petitioners’
counsel
contends
that
there’s
no
need
for
this.
this
record
itself
suggests
that
there
is
in
need
for
this
on
page
31
of
the
appendix
in
which
the
testimony
was
about
what
the
false
story
was
to
be
in
this
state
proceedings
which
as
we’ve
noted
came
to
not
in
this
case,
these
votes
were
not
thrown
out
in
the
state
proceedings.
the
bottom
of
page
31,
the
question
was,
“did
they
tell
you
what
the
story
was
to
be?”
answer,
“well,
like
garret
sullins’
voting
for
one
thing
and
if
we
would
stick
together
in
telling
falsehoods
about
this,
that
we
would
could
not
be
convicted
of
nothing
because
we
had
the
county
court,
the
judge,
and
the
prosecuting
attorney,
and
the
sheriff.”
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
may
not
be
beyond
debate
but
the
holdings
of
what
241
means
is
that
there
is
federal
protection
for
the
constitutional
rights
of
individuals
under
the
federal
constitution
and
certainly
one
of
the
most
important
of
those
rights
is
not
to
have
his
vote
diluted
improperly.
this
has
been
the
whole
thrust
of
the
series
of
reapportion
in
cases
addressed
an
improper
dilution
of
ones
voted
certainly
and
certainly
am
improper
dilution
to
cancel
it
out
through
ballot
box
stuffing
and
in
effect
make
it
a
half
vote
or
a
third
of
the
vote.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
say
it
would
cover
it
and
the
petitioner's
theory
is
that
it
would
not
cover
it
even
in
a
federal
election
because
the
congress
that
enacted
241
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
nineteenth
amendment
that
it
did
not
have
power
to
protect
against
sex
discrimination.
the
same
thing
would
be
true
about
the
poll
tax
that
is
protected
against
in
the
twenty-fourth
amendment
and
the
18-year
old
vote
that
the
twenty-sixth
amendment
affords
protection
for.
the
court
in
this
whole
series
of
cases
for
mosley
through
price
and
guest
has
rejected
the
idea
that
241
which
is
written
in
generic
terms
to
apply
all
of
these
rights
has
frozen
the
constitutional
rights
protected
to
those
that
existed
in
1870.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mosley
was
a
federal
election,
your
honor.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
ballot
box
stuffing
in
a
federal
election,
that
is
correct
and
that
is
his
theory,
that
that
could
be
protected,
ballot
box
stuffing
or
racial
discrimination
in
a
federal
or
state
election.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
be
the
sex
discrimination.
well,
the
old
holdings
were
that
241
did
not
apply
under
the
bathgate
case
in
a
federal
election
to
bribery
of
voters
and
that
was
the
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
principal
issue
is
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
this
is
something
that
the
court
would
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
did
not.
my
understanding
of
his
theory
is
that
241
must
be
interpreted
in
light
of
the
powers,
the
congress
thought
it
had
in
1870
and
if
congress
at
that
time
thought
it
could
not
protect
against
sex
discrimination
in
federal
or
state
election
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--
and
241
wouldn’t
cover
it.
that
inquiry
would
have
to
be
made.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
he’s
not
asking
the
court
to
overrule
saylor
and
saylor
was
a
direct
holding
on
that
point
but
it
does
cover
ballot
box
stuffing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
federal
elections.
that’s
right.
i
don’t
want
to
make
his
contention
for
him
and
say
what
it
is
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
theory
of
his
case
as
i
understand
it
because
there’s
no
other
basis
on
which
he
is
asking
the
limitation
of
241
and
i
don’t
see
any
other
basis
after
price
and
guest
in
which
he
can
ask
for
a
limitation
of
241.
his
theory
has
to
be
that
it’s
limited
to
what
congress
thought
it
had
the
right
to
protect
against
in
1870.
it
seems
to
us,
the
holding
in
guest,
the
holding
in
guest
rejects
that
theory
because
at
that
time
it
was
even
before
plessy
against
ferguson
had
been
decided
but
that
certainly
was
the
governing
principle
of
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
at
that
time
and
yet
the
holding
in
guest
was
that
in
a
series
of
cases
beginning
with
brown
against
board
of
education
another
constitutional
principle
had
come
in
to
prevail
and
was
embraced
within
the
protection
of
section
241.
so,
i
don’t
think
that
this
necessarily
seem
like
the
more
difficult
issue
to
the
court
of
appeals.
it
seemed
to
them
like
something
that
had
been
decided
in
guest
and
price
and
we
agree
with
them
that
the
essential
thrust
guest
and
price
is
that
241
applies
to
these
rights.
this
was
thoroughly
considered
at
the
time,
241
had
given
the
court
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
in
a
unanimous
opinion
in
price,
the
court
concluded
that
241
does
apply
all
rights
under
the
thirteenth,
fourteenth,
and
fifteenth
amendments
italicizing
all
in
the
court’s
opinion
as
well
as
to
all
other
constitutional
rights.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
see
no
need
for
because
they
decided
cases
involving
voting
frauds
under
241
seems
to
us,
show
that
the
statute
protects
against
falsifying
elections
for
federal
offices
in
the
manner
that
it
was
done
here
and
we
don’t
think
there
was
any
ambiguity
even
about
whether
this
was
all
one
conspiracy
and
--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes
that
you
can
nearly
hold
--
the
court
of
appeals
did
hold
that
the
evidence
with
respect
to
the
contest
proceedings
was
properly
admissible
here
because
the
conspiracy
lasted
this
long
even
though
there
was
no
longer
any
contest
about
the
federal
officers
and
our
submission
is
that
that
holding
was
correct
as
far
as
it
went
and
suffices
to
uphold
this
conviction.
this
is
exactly
the
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
had
before
it
in
a
case
called
devoe
against
the
united
states
which
is
cited
in
the
footnote
at
the
very
bottom
of
page
15
of
our
brief.
a
case
back
in
103
f.2d
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
had
to
say
in
that
case
was
the
government’s
evidence.
i’m
quoting
from
page
588
now
at
103
f.2d,
“the
government’s
evidence
was
not
at
any
time
directed
towards
showing
the
existence
of
a
number
of
separate
and
distinct
conspiracies
but
was
directed
toward
showing
one
general
conspiracy
which
contemplated
in
part
a
false
count
and
a
false
certification
of
the
ballots
cast
for
the
congressional
candidates.
so
much
of
the
conspiracy
has
constituted
a
violation
of
the
federal
law
was
a
part
of
the
general
plan
or
scheme
of
those
engaged
in
the
conspiracy.
the
contention
of
the
government
should
have
been
limited
in
its
proof
to
only
so
much
of
the
evidence
as
directly
bore
upon
the
portion
of
the
conspiracy
which
constituted
the
violation
of
federal
law
is
we
think
unsound.”
and
that
is
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
present
case
could
have
used
the
exact
same
language
in
disposing
off
the
case
without
reaching
the
issue
whether
241
applies
to
a
conspiracy
that
do
not
involve
the
casting
of
fraudulent
votes
for
the
federal
officers.
so,
we
think
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed
on
either
of
these
grounds.
we
leave
to
our
brief
the
discussion
of
the
adequacy
of
the
indictment
to
alleged
action
under
color
of
law
if
the
court
reaches
that
issue.
