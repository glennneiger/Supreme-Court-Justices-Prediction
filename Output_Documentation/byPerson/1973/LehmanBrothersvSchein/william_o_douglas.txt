justice
william
o.
douglas
these
cases
are
here
on
petitions
for
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
litigation
in
the
district
court
in
new
york
is
based
upon
diversity
of
citizenship.
there
is
a
single
question
of
law
that
has
emerged
so
far
in
this
litigation
and
that
is,
what
is
the
law
of
florida
that
governs
this
critical
central
issue.
now
the
courts
below
very
quite
proper
in
looking
to
florida
law
under
the
area
--
its
competence
to
determine
what
the
resolution
of
the
question
is,
because
this
corporation
is
a
florida
corporation
and
the
members
of
the
court
of
appeals
were
divided.
there
has
been
a
much
discussion
and
debate
about
the
question
of
what
the
florida
law
is.
there
are
no
florida
decisions,
and
the
courts
of
appeals
with
court
appeals
and
the
district
court
both
made
valiant
efforts
to
figure
out
what
the
florida
law
was
by
analogous
cases
and
other
states
including
new
york.
there
are
ten
states
in
the
country
now
that
have
a
provision
or
by
statute
or
by
court
rule,
a
federal
district
court
or
a
federal
court
of
appeals
or
this
court
and
certify
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state,
these
laws
involved,
a
question
and
they
have
jurisdiction
to
resolve
that
question.
we
have
used
it
before.
we
don’t
say
that
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
should
use
it,
but
we
think
it
is
a
matter
for
them
in
their
discretion
to
consider
on
the
remand
of
the
case.
therefore,
we
reverse
and
remand
on
that
point
only.
