i
take
it
that
it
is
accepted
that
florida
law
does
apply
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
was
after
the
decision
came
down,
including
judge
kaufman’s
dissent?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
was
there
a
reason
for
not
moving
for
certification
before
the
decision?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
i
am
just
going
to
ask
whether
judge
kaufman’s
dissent
was
on
the
certification
issue
was
really
a
sua
sponte,
was
this
his
own
idea?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
was
not
discussed
at
oral
argument?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
ruby,
have
the
petitioners
here,
suggested
to
the
second
circuit
at
the
oral
argument
of
the
case
that
it'd
be
certified,
what
is
your
guess
as
to
the
reaction
of
the
panel?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
feel
that
the
failure
of
the
majority
even
to
mention
it
in
their
written
opinion
is
not
necessarily
indicative
of
the
fact
that
they
felt
that
the
case
had
gone
too
far
for
certification?
