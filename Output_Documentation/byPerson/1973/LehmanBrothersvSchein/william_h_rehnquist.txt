did
your
clients
make
any
request
to
judge
tyler
that
he
certify
the
florida
law
question
to
the
florida
courts?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
did
you
first
request
that
this
question
be
certified?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
would
presume,
if
you
would
have
prevailed
in
the
second
circuit
without
ever
certifying
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
you
would
not
be
interested
in
certifying?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
second
circuit
can’t
change
the
law
of
florida,
can
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
hagan,
do
you
think
it
makes
any
difference
that
thibodaux
arose
in
a
district
court
in
louisiana
and
depended
on
louisiana
law
and
kaiser
arose
in
a
district
court
in
new
mexico
and
depended
on
new
mexico
law,
where
this
arose
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
and
depended
on
florida
law?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
the
district
court
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
tell
these
litigants
to
do
when
it
abstains
--
just
dismiss
their
action
and
tell
the
plaintiff
to
go
get
service
and
[voice

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
supreme
court
of
florida
hear
oral
argument
or
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
parties
will
then
go
down
to
tallahassee
and
argue
the
case?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
inquiry
under
erie
is
actually
for
the
court
in
sitting
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
is
what
conflicts
of
law
would
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
apply
in
this
case,
isn’t
it?
then
you
look
to
that
new
york
law
and
if
that
new
york
law
in
turn
refers
you
to
florida
law,
then
the
district
court
goes
to
florida
law.
