justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
i
think
they
could,
would
you
refer
it,
they
found
the
statute
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
hagan,
have
you
answered
to
mr.
justice
blackmun?
is
there
any
dispute
among
the
parties
now
that
florida
law
is
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
none
here
of
course?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
do
not
know
about
many
but
we
did
in
aldrich,
didn’t
we?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
remember
all
that
was
sua
sponte.
it
was
clay,
i
don’t
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
ask
mr.
hagan?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
it
were
not
this
florida
procedure,
would
this
be
a
case
for
federal
abstention?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
no
constitutional
question
(inaudible)
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that’s
an
argument
whether
or
not
this
would
have
been
a
case
for
abstention.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
long
as
florida
has
this
statute,
the
federal
courts
have
to
avail
one?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
except
that
it
expands
to
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
hagan,
may
i
just
ask.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
is
there
anything,
any
of
these
statutes
which
permit
whether
our
federal
questions
are
in
the
case,
a
reservation
of
the
federal
questions
as
we
held
at
england,
the
litigant
and
an
abstention
case
finding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
uniform
act
so
limits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
may
i
ask
mr.
ruby.
the
way
the
rule,
the
florida
rule
reads,
there
has
to
be
an
initial
determination
of
(a)
whether
florida
law
would
be
determinative
and
(b)
that
there
are
no
clear
controlling
precedences
in
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
now,
i
take
it
from
that
initial
determination
has
to
be
made
by
the
certifying
court,
does
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
are
not
suggesting
that
in
fact,
the
majority
below
who
did
even
make
that
inquiry,
did
they?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
my
question
was
rather,
whether
they
addressed
the
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals
even
addressed
themselves
on
the
two
questions,
whether
part
of
law
would
be
determinative,
i
guess,
they
did
say
that,
but
about
the
other,
that
there
are
no
clear
controlling
precedence
in
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
did
they
address
themselves
to
that?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well
mr.
ruby,
i
gather,
had
there
been
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
a
white
horse
case
with
your
own
since
florida
case
--
this
whole
case
depends
on
florida
law.
were
that
through
the
second
circuit
and
the
district
court
would
necessarily
have
had
to
apply
that
florida
case
would
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
really,
what’s
involved
here
then
is
there
is
no
such
case,
i
gather?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
right
or
at
least
it
is
debatable
whether
there
is
anything
that
even
points
to
the
florida
and
here
is
a
way
that
you
can
get
because
there
isn’t
presently
one,
a
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court
on
what
the
florida
law
is
and
that
certainly
is
more
definitive
than
anything
either
this
court
or
the
second
circuit
or
the
district
court
can
provide?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
don’t
know
what
you’re
giving
up?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
may
i
suggest
mr.
ruby
rather
than
--
rather
then
they're
not
doing
their
job,
but
doing
it
more
effectively,
if
they’d
take
advantage
of
this
opportunity.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
they
have
to
decide
it
as
it
would
be
decided
under
florida
law.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
that
being
so
--
and
not
presently
being
any
decisions
of
the
florida
supreme
court
which
provide
the
answer
and
here
you
have
an
opportunity
to
get
the
decision
applicable
to
your
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
have
forgotten
where
we
have
invoked
this
florida
procedure
in
clay
and
then
aldrich
and
dresner.
we
did
not
have
any
federal
questions
or
did
we
in
those
cases
to
[voice
overlap]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
we
have
a
federal
constitutional
question
that
we
have
to
decide
if
we
have
them?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
in
the
other
two,
aldrich
and
dresner?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
was
the
divorce
case,
was
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

would
