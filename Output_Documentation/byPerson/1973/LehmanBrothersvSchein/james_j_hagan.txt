mr.
james
j.
hagan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
three
cases
are
here
on
the
grant
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
issue
has
been
limited
to
the
question
of
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
failing
to
certify
the
question
of
florida
law
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
pursuant
to
its
certification
statute.
i
will
speak
for
the
petitioners
in
the
three
cases
which
have
been
consolidated
for
argument
and
i
would
ask
to
reserve
three
minutes
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
it
is
the
position
of
petitioners
here
your
honors
that
it
was
error
for
the
second
circuit
to
refuse
to
certify
the
issue
of
florida
law
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
the
decision
below
exemplifies
a
new
doctrine
on
the
florida
law
or
in
fact
the
law
of
any
state.
although
purporting
to
find
support
under
the
case
of
diamond
against
oreamuno
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york,
the
decision
below
here
is
in
fact
a
radical
extension
of
the
diamond
case.
the
question
of
florida
law
here
is
significant
under
the
public
policy
of
florida.
it
involves
a
florida
corporation
and
it
involves
the
regulation
of
that
corporation’s
relationship
to
its
fiduciaries
and
its
shareholders
and
to
those
who
buy
and
sell
its
stock.
the
decision
below
adopted
a
remedy
here
which
could
interfere
with
recovery
by
shareholders
of
that
corporation
when
they
sue
on
an
insider
trading
case.
therefore,
we
can
believe
that
in
light
of
the
significant
question
of
florida
law
and
public
policy
that
was
involved,
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
certified
the
question
as
it
was
requested
to
do
by
judge
kaufman
in
his
dissenting
opinion.
now,
your
honors,
i
would
briefly
discuss
the
underlined
facts
in
this
case
and
the
opinions
below.
this
case
arose
out
of
an
alleged
misuse
of
inside
information
and
subsequent
insider
trading.
lum’s
incorporated
is
a
florida
corporation
which
was
engaged
in
the
fast
food
franchising
business.
during
1969,
in
the
attempt
of
diversification,
it
acquired
a
gambling
casino
in
las
vegas
known
as
caesar’s
palace.
and
to
acquaint
the
financial
community
with
its
new
acquisition,
it
held
what
it
described
as
a
seminar
in
caesar’s
palace
in
november
of
1969.
apparently,
during
that
seminar,
it
released
an
earning’s
forecast
of
a
dollar
to
a
dollar
ten
cents
per
share.
subsequently,
in
january
of
1970,
it
was
alleged
and
when
i
make
these
claims
of
allegations,
i
am
basically
stating
the
allegations
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
which
filed
a
complaint
for
injunctive
relief
in
december
1970,
all
of
the
subsequent
civil
cases
are
basically
copies,
if
you
will,
of
the
sec
complaint.
it
was
alleged
that
one
melvin
chasen,
who
was
the
chief
operating
officer
of
lum’s,
learned
of
a
decline,
substantial
decline
in
the
earnings
for
lum’s
second
quarter
that
he
advised
a
mr.
benjamin
simon,
who
was
a
registered
representative
employed
by
lehman
brothers
in
its
chicago
office
of
this
decline.
and
that
mr.
simon
in
turn
passed
on
this
information
to
representatives
of
investors
diversified
services
in
minneapolis.
all
of
these
events
were
alleged
to
have
occurred
on
january
8
and
on
january
9,
two
of
the
ids
funds
sold
83,000
shares
of
lum’s
stock.
trading
was
suspended
on
the
9th.
lum’s
issued
a
press
release
later
in
the
afternoon
announcing
the
decline
in
its
earnings.
when
trading
resumed
the
following
monday,
the
stock
was
off
$3.00
to
$4.00
per
share.
the
sales
on
the
previous
friday,
had
occurred
at
$17.00.
now
the
sec
investigated
and
in
the
following
december,
as
i
said,
they
filed
an
injunction
action
and
that
was
followed
by
a
rash
of
civil
suits
and
those
suits
basically
fell
into
two
categories.
one
category
consisted
of
derivative
actions
seeking
recovery
by
lum's
of
the
trading
profits.
the
second
category
was
a
class
action.
several
suits
constitute,
class
actions
on
behalf
of
sellers
or
purchasers
of
the
stock
on
the
day
of
the
trade-off.
so
at
the
commencement
of
the
litigation
there
were
three
prompts
to
the
regulatory
structure:
the
sec
injunction
action,
the
derivative
suits,
and
the
class
actions.
now,
the
defendants
below
moved
to
dismiss
before
judge
tyler,
the
derivative
actions.
the
derivative
actions
were
premised
on
the
rule
of
diamond
against
oreamuno,
which
is
a
new
york
case
and
that
case
briefly
stated
that
officers
and
directors
of
a
corporation
who
trade
on
inside
information
are
required
to
remit
their
profits
to
the
corporation
even
though
the
corporation
has
not
been
damaged
in
any
legal
sense.
the
court
espoused
this
doctrine
in
the
context
of
a
situation
which
was
really
a
gross
instance
of
misuse
of
corporate
information
the
two
top
officers
of
the
company,
mai
had
learned
of
an
earnings
declined
and
had
sold
their
own
stock
at
triggering
an
enormous
decline
in
the
price
of
the
shares.
as
the
case
reached
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york,
there
were
no
other
actions
pending.
the
sec
had
not
commenced
the
preceding,
section
16
(b)
did
not
apply
because
the
stock
had
been
held
more
than
six
months
and
there
were
no
class
actions
or
any
actions
pending
by
any
of
the
defrauded
purchasers
of
that
stock.
and
so,
the
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
strongly
urged
in
the
brief
by
the
respondent
was
that
if
no
remedy
is
fashioned
here,
these
parties
escaped
with
the
illegal
profits.
that
was
the
context
of
the
diamond
case.
it
is
the
law
in
new
york
to
the
best
of
our
research,
it
has
never
been
cited
or
discussed
in
any
decision
in
any
other
state
court.
it’s
five
years
old
now.
it
came
down
in
1969.
so
the
derivative
suits
here
were
premised
on
the
diamond
case,
but
it
was
the
defendants’
position
that
it
was
the
law
of
florida
that
applied
to
the
responsibility
of
insiders
to
the
corporation.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
the
defendants
your
honor
were
lum's,
the
corporation;
mr.
chasen,
lehman
brothers
and
its
employee
benjamin
simon;
investors
diversified
services
and
two
of
its
funds
and
two
employees
of
ids
who
are
alleged
to
have
receive
the
tip
and
recommended
the
sale
of
the
stock.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
yes,
your
honor,
yes.
they
were
actually
corporate
officers
and
directors
including
directors
who
had
not
actually
made
the
trades,
but
had
acquiesced
in
the
situation
after
they
learned
of
the
matter
and
the
lower
court
had
dismissed
the
case
against
those
directors
and
the
appellate
division
had
affirmed
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
that
point
holding
only
the
wrongdoing
officers
and
directors
[voice
overlap]
mr.
james
j.
hagan
that’s
correct
your
honor,
that
it
actually
sold
the
shares.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
just
mr.
chasen.
mr.
chasen
was
an
officer
and
also
a
director
of
lum's.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
lehman
brothers
had
no
relationship
to
lum's.
it
was
not
its
investment
advisor.
it
had
not
done
any
investment
banking
for
it.
it
was
really
without
dispute
that
there
was
no
relationship
there.
ids
--
some
of
the
ids
funds
held
the
stock
in
its
portfolio.
other
than
that,
there
was
no
relationship
there
either.
so
the
only
conceivable
nexus
between
our
case
and
diamond
was
mr.
chasen.
now
judge
tyler
as
i
said,
the
defendants
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
florida
law
applied
under
the
law
of
florida.
you
first
must
show
damage
to
your
corporation
before
derivative
suit
will
lie
that
even
under
diamond,
assuming
arguendo
diamond
applied,
there
were
no
profits
here
on
the
part
of
any
defendant
other
than
arguably
the
ids
funds
and
other
than
mr.
chasen
who
had
no
profits,
there
were
no
fiduciaries
involved.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
your
honor,
in
the
lower
court
before
judge
tyler,
the
defendants
argue
that
florida
law
applied
but
the
respondents
disputed
this
point.
they
argued
strenuously
before
judge
tyler
that
new
york
law
applied
and
they
urged
that
the
diamond
rule
be
imposed
and
that
the
rule
will
be
expanded.
and
the
expansion
of
course
has
to
proceed
on
two
grounds.
it
had
to
go
beyond
the
officer
or
director
holding
of
diamond
because
that
was
the
holding
of
diamond.
officers
and
directors
and
the
rationale
was
encouragement
of
private
attorneys
general
to
regulate
the
corporation,
it
was
phrased
in
that
manner.
they
also
have
to
go
beyond
diamond
to
pick
up
parties
who
hadn't
profited
because
again
in
diamond,
only
the
directors
who
actually
profited
had
been
held
liable.
so
there
were
two
extensions
of
diamond
then
in
an
affect
that
they
were
urging
a
rule
which
really
had
very
little
relationship
back
to
the
diamond
case
although
that
was
the
springboard
for
the
argument.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
no,
we
did
not
your
honor.[voice
overlap]
mr.
james
j.
hagan
first
of
all
--
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
florida
statute
unlike
other
statutes
in
many
states
only
permits
an
appellate
court
to
certify
the
question.
subsequent
statutes
in
many
of
our
states
that
had
been
adopted
in
the
last
number
of
years
have
adopted
the
recommendation
of
the
uniform
commissioners,
the
uniform
act
and
permit
district
courts
to
certify.
but
in
any
event,
the
question
was
never
raised
before
judge
tyler.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
the
first
request
was
on
the
petition
for
rehearing
before
second
circuit
your
honor,
and
--
mr.
james
j.
hagan
that’s
correct.
judge
kaufman’s
dissent
was
the
first
time,
the
certification
question
is
raised
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
by
any
litigant
or
judge.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
well,
your
honor,
i
think
as
far
as
the
present
petitioners
were
concerned,
it
was
their
position
that
the
law
of
florida
was
not
unclear
or
uncertain.
florida
law,
at
least,
let
me
clarify
that.
it
was
not
unclear
to
the
extent
that
florida’s
law
required
that
you
show
actual
damages
to
your
corporation
before
derivative
suit
would
lie.
the
diamond
case
in
new
york,
flatly
contradicted
that.
it
held
no
damages
--
no
damage
requirement
was
necessary.
secondly,
to
the
extent
that
florida
had
never
discussed
the
diamond
rule,
it
could
have
been
argued
i
suppose
that
it
was
therefore
uncertain.
so
to
that
extent,
you
could
either
say
that
florida
law
was
settled
against
the
respondents
or
uncertain
because
they
had
never
discussed
diamond
and
one
could
only
speculate
what
they
would
do
if
diamond
was
argued
to
them.
but
again,
even
if
you
argued
diamond
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
this
is
not
a
diamond
situation.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
yes,
i
was
getting
to
that,
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
brennan.
in
the
lower
court,
the
respondents
argued
new
york
law.
judge
tyler
found
florida
law.
on
appeal,
the
respondents
here,
appellants
before
the
second
circuit
conceded
florida
law
applied
and
so
when
mr.
justice
waterman
wrote
his
majority
opinion,
he
pointed
out
both
parties
concede
and
we
so
find
that
florida
law
applied.
although
there
was
a
dispute
in
the
district
court
as
to
the
proper
choice
of
law,
there
was
no
dispute
before
the
second
circuit
on
this
point.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
there
appears
to
be
none
here,
no.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
not
discussed
at
oral
argument
and
not
discussed
in
the
briefs.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
your
honor,
it
was
not
our
position
before
the
second
circuit.
first
of
all,
the
predicate
for
certification
is
a
finding
that
the
law
of
the
state
is
unsettled
or
uncertain
and
it
was
never
our
position
and
it
is
not
our
position
today
actually
that
the
law
of
florida
was
so
uncertain
or
unsettled.
it
became
that
way
for
the
first
time
on
the
opinion
out
of
the
second
circuit.
prior
to
that
opinion,
the
law
of
florida
has
enunciated
in
four
intermediate
appellate
court
opinions
was
that
damages
were
required
in
a
situation
like
this.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
well,
your
honor,
what
the
second
circuit
did
here,
i
submit
was
imposing
new
rule
on
the
law
of
florida.
the
second
circuit
here
adopted
as
florida’s
rule,
a
doctrine
which
no
one
can
find
in
the
law
of
florida.
at
least
none
of
the
parties
that
have
been
able
to
find
it
in
the
law
of
florida.
certainly,
my
friend
from
the
respondents
has
been
unable
to
point
out
any
florida
priorities
and
support
and
the
majority
in
the
second
circuit
agreed
that
there
were
no
florida
precedents
on
point.
it
disregarded,
may
i
say
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
disregarded
the
four
decisions
of
the
florida
intermediate
appellate
courts
on
the
damage
point
exemplified
by
palma
against
zerbey
which
was
1966.
it
disregarded
those
in
a
footnote
as
not
persuasive
because
there
had
not
been
any
extensive
discussion
of
the
question
and
there
have
been
a
rather
conclusionary
statement
citing
earlier
opinions
and
the
only
analysis
of
it
is
in
that
footnote
where
the
court
said
it
found
these
cases
not
persuasive
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
florida
law
as
far
as
the
majority
opinion
below
was
concerned.
now
of
course,
our
position
had
been
that
to
that
extent
the
law
is
settled
and
here,
you
cannot
state
a
claim
unless
you
can
prove
damages.
now,
in
any
event,
judge
tyler’s
[voice
overlap]
i
am
sorry
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
to
which
case?
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
oh!
yes,
your
honor.
this
has
happened
here.
this
court,
this
court
has
sua
sponte
certified
questions
on
many
occasions.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
you
did
in
aldrich
and
you
did
in
the
clay
and
you
did
in
dresner
against
city
of
tallahassee.
those
were
--
mr.
james
j.
hagan
i
believe
clay
also
your
honor
was
sua
sponte.
i
don’t
believe
that
anyone
had
requested
certification
there.
in
fact,
i
believe
that’s
the
first
reported
decision
that
i
am
aware
of
where
the
question
arose.
and
this
court
has
as
many
times
of
course
expressed
its
views
on
certification,
the
appropriateness
of
it.
even
those
on
the
court
that
have
express
reservations
about
the
whole
abstention
doctrine
and
the
problems
it
raises
have
often
times
endorse
certification.
in
any
event
--
i
am
sorry,
are
there
any
other
questions
on
that
point?
judge
tyler
found
that
florida
law
applied.
he
found
that
damages
were
required.
he
found
that
although
--
he
decided
the
question
under
diamond
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
and
said,
even
if
diamond,
the
law
of
florida
did
not
apply
because
none
of
the
party
is
fit
within
the
diamond
rule.
the
ones
that
were
--
the
one
that
was
an
officer
hadn’t
profited.
the
ones
that
profited
were
not
officers
or
directors.
now,
when
the
case
went
up
to
the
second
circuit,
the
majority
in
effect,
they
did
reverse
judge
tyler.
they
found
that
there
was
no
florida
law
on
point.
they
believe
they
had
the
right
to
look
to
the
law
of
other
states,
specifically
new
york
and
the
diamond
rule
and
they
then
extended
the
diamond
rule
in
several
respects.
they
extended
the
concept
of
the
fiduciary
beyond
the
officer
and
director
category
to
pick
up
as
they
put
it
anyone
who
receives
inside
information,
becomes
ipso
facto
a
fiduciary.
although
they
did
not
use
the
term
i
suppose,
the
concept
will
be
something
akin
to
a
constructive
fiduciary
once
you
receive
the
information.
they
then
postulated
a
common
enterprise
theory
and
cited
certain
antitrust
cases
to
support
the
proposition
and
then
said
that
as
in
a
conspiracy
situation
or
a
joint
tort,
all
of
the
defendants
were
liable
for
the
profits
of
anyone.
they
spent
sometime
discussing
the
problems
with
law
of
insider
trading
and
the
necessity
to
tighten
the
doctrine.
judge
kaufman’s
dissent
agreed
of
course
and
there’s
no
issue
here
on
the
condemnation
of
insider
trading.
he
held
however
that
the
majority
had
invented
a
totally
new
concept
of
law,
even
under
the
law
of
new
york,
but
certainly,
it
had
no
basis
in
florida
law.
he
urged
that
the
majority
certify
the
question
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
there
was
no
discussion
in
the
majority
opinion.
it
had
no
response,
it
did
not
respond
to
judge
kaufman’s
comment.
petitions
for
rehearing
were
filed.
it
was
urged
on
the
court
that
the
matter
would
be
certified,
but
it
was
not
denied
and
we
are
now
here
on
certiorari.
and
we
urge
your
honor
that
it
was
error
for
the
court
to
refuse
to
certify
in
this
area.
this
decision
has
imposed
in
effect
a
new
regulatory
framework
upon
trading
in
the
stock
of
florida
corporations.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
we
believe
it
would
be
your
honor.
of
course
we
don’t
--
mr.
james
j.
hagan
well,
your
honor,
we
feel
that
under
this
court’s
decision
in
thibodaux
and
kaiser
steel,
this
would
be
the
type
of
question.
there
is
no
neat
characterization
of
when
a
question
like
this
can
really
be
said
to
support
abstention,
but
we
believe
that
even,
if
you
did
not
have
a
certification
statute,
a
strong
argument
could
be
made
here
for
abstention
because
of
the
policy
questions
involved.
after
all,
this
is
a
florida
corporation.
the
state
of
florida
has
expressed
its
own
public
policy
by
adopting
a
certification
statute,
the
first
state
to
do
so
in
1945.
but
it
would
like
to
have
a
say
in
what
the
law
of
florida
is
and
for
a
court
--
a
federal
court
to
discuss
the
duties
and
liabilities
flowing
from
certain
factual
situations
involving
a
florida
corporation
it
seems
to
me
raise
--
mr.
james
j.
hagan
that
is,
you’re
right.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
that
is
our
position
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
i
think
that
makes
our
case
much
stronger,
your
honor
because
--
mr.
james
j.
hagan
well,
because
in
those
situations,
presumably,
the
federal
court
sitting
in
those
districts
would
be
knowledgeable
in
the
law
of
the
jurisdiction.
the
district
court
sitting
in
louisiana
can
be
presumed
to
be
more
knowledgeable
of
louisiana
law
than
say
at
new
york
federal
court
and
it
is
rather
ironic
here
your
honor
to
think
that
if
this
case
had
arisen
in
the
fifth
circuit
within
which
florida
lies,
this
question
would
undoubtedly,
if
one
can
read
the
fifth
circuit
precedents
correct,
it
would
have
been
certified
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
the
fifth
circuit
has
used
this
procedure
on
many
occasions.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
your
honor,
here,
if
a
state
has
a
certification
statute
and
today,
12
states
do
and
there
has
been
quite
a
trend
here
in
the
last
number
of
years,
depending
upon
whether
the
statute
of
the
state
permits
district
court
certification
or
appellate
court
certification,
the
parties
frame
a
certified
question
to
the
court
of
that
state.
the
briefing
--
there
is
a
briefing
period
of
60
days
at
least
under
the
florida
statute.
the
question
is
presented,
the
parties
brief
it,
oral
argument
is
optional
and
then
the
certifying
court
responds
back
and
answers
the
law
of
florida
in
this
situation
as
does
itself.
that
is
reported
back
to
the
federal
court.
this
raises
none
of
the
problems
that
have
plagued
the
courts
and
over
the
number
of
years
since
the
abstention
doctrine
was
first
enunciated.
first
of
all,
the
delay
problem
is
minimized.
you
don’t
hear
of
a
situation
where
you
have
to
proceed
in
the
lower
court
and
up
to
the
appellate
procedures
in
the
state.
you
go
directly
to
the
supreme
court
of
that
state
for
a
final
and
definitive
ruling
on
the
law.
but
i
would
say,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
here,
if
the
fifth
circuit
had
had
this,
i
am
sure
it
would
have
been
certified.
as
the
fact
that
the
second
circuit
had
it
and
did
not
certify
it
when
presumably
it
is
not
that
knowledgeable
on
florida
law
is
even
stronger
case
for
certification.
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to
briefly
discuss
the
trend
here
which
i
think
is
important
your
honors
because
there
has
been
since
1960s,
since
this
court
first
used
the
certification
doctrine,
there
has
been
a
development
here
which
i
know
this
court
is
aware
of
and
if
in
fairness,
the
court
disagrees
with
this
trend,
presumably,
this
would
be
the
case
to
discuss
it
because
since
1960
in
the
clay
case.
when
there
was
only
one
state
with
the
certification
statue,
this
court
followed
up
with
certification,
suggestions
and
aldrich
and
dresner
in
1963.
in
1964
in
his
concurrence
in
the
england
case,
mr.
justice
douglas
although
expressing
strong
reservations
about
the
abstention
doctrine,
strongly
endorsed
certification
as
a
possible
solution
to
these
problems.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
now,
we
have
12,
your
honor.
we
had
10
in
our
main
brief
and
we
actually
picked
up
two
more
in
our
reply
brief.
minnesota
and
oklahoma
adopted
at
the
73
sessions
and
we
have
cited
those
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
basically
yes.
because
in
1965,
you
had
fours
states
adopt
hawaii,
maine,
new
hampshire
and
washington.
there
was
some
difference
among
them,
but
in
1967,
a
uniform
act
was
adopted
by
the
commissioners
of
state
laws.
this
was
basically
the
florida
statute
with
some
minor
variations.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
it
goes
to
the
district
court
also,
from
its
district
court
certification.
it
was
approved
by
the
aba
in
1967,
by
the
ali
(american
law
institute)
in
1969
and
since
that
time,
you
had
a
number
of
other
states
so
that
you
now
have
12
states
that
have
adopted
this
doctrine.
and
so
we
submit,
this
was
a
proper
case
for
certification.
it
should
have
been
certified
and
the
failure
to
do
so
when
requested
by
judge
kaufman
was
error
sufficient
to
justify
reversal
and
remand.
i
will
now
stop.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
yes.
they
really
don’t
--
they
don’t
really
extend
to
that
problem
that
we
have
in
england,
the
danger
of
deciding
the
federal
question
and
the
res
judicata
problem
that
arises.
they
are
limited
to
the
question
of
state
law
and
where
the
question
of
state
law
maybe
determinative
of
the
issue,
not
just
--
mr.
james
j.
hagan
yes,
yes.
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
your
honors,
i
believe
that
mr.
ruby
has
overstated
the
position
of
the
petitioners
here
and
overstated
the
argument.
we
do
not
argue
here
for
abstention.
his
entire
argument
in
rebuttal
and
response
is
based
on
an
abstention
argument
on
the
behalf
of
the
petitioners.
of
course,
this
does
not
take
away
the
right
of
any
party
that
went
to
federal
court.
the
argument
in
favor
of
certification
is
that,
it
preserves
that
right.
that
federal
fact
finding
is
available,
federal
rules
of
discovery
are
available.
the
only
issue
that
is
certified
is
the
issue
of
state
law
and
it
is
found
by
the
federal
court
in
the
same
manner
many
other
things
are
found
in
the
litigation.
in
this
case,
the
question
of
florida
law
almost
becomes
in
effect
a
fact
to
be
found
by
utilizing
the
certification
statute.
they
argue
merit
and
they
are
setting
up
a
straw
man
here.
we
do
not
claim
abstention.
there
is
no
need
for
it.
that
is
in
effect
the
beauty
of
the
new
certification
statutes.
these
arguments
that
have
plagued
the
courts
and
the
commentators
for
20
or
30
years,
may
in
the
future
start
to
alleviate
because
abstention
in
this
area
may
not
be
necessary
anymore.
mr.
justice
marshall
as
well,
pointed
out
that
their
basic
position
is
that
certification
is
not
justified
in
any
case
because
obviously,
you
always
have
delay.
the
delay
involved
maybe
several
months,
it
maybe
six
months
or
more,
but
i
would
say
that
the
answer
to
this
delay
argument
which
is
always
brought
up
by
the
party
opposing
either
abstention
or
certification
was
well
answered
by
this
court
back
in
1942
in
fieldcrest
dairies,
where
mr.
justice
douglas
said,
considerations
of
delay
inconvenience
and
cost
to
the
parties
which
have
been
urged
upon
us,
do
not
call
for
a
different
result.
they
were
there
granting
abstention.
what
we
are
here
concerned
with
the
much
larger
issue
as
to
the
appropriate
relationship
between
federal
and
state
authorities,
functioning
as
a
harmonious
whole
and
that
issue
is
exactly
before
the
court
today.
the
problems
that
have
been
raised
by
abstention
over
the
years
have
now
started
to
result
in
the
statutory
certification
process
and
i
submit
that
the
court
should
now
encourage
it.
and
finally,
this
point
that
who
gets
certification,
whether
you
grant
certification
should
almost
be
a
form
of
gamesmanship
as
to
who
asks
first
or
who
does
not
ask
for
it
is
simply
inappropriate.
when
we
were
before
the
second
circuit,
we
were
parties
to
a
litigation
where
our
view
was
that
florida
law
did
not
support
the
claim
and
the
district
court
had
so
found
and
respondents
here
were
unable
to
cite
a
single
florida
case
supporting
their
position.
it
was
not
our
position
before
the
second
circuit
that
florida
law
was
so
uncertain
as
to
require
certification.
it
became
that
way
when
the
majority
here
developed
a
doctrine
it
did.
only
then
that
the
question
of
certification,
come
to
the
forefront.
prior
to
that
time,
our
position
was
not
that
the
law
of
florida
was
unsettled
or
uncertain.
now,
with
all
of
the
problems
mr.
ruby
points
out
about
classical
abstention,
certainly
the
court
that
has
had
the
most
experience
with
certification
in
a
federal
context
has
not
found
it
to
be
a
burden
and
has
found
it
in
fact
to
be
a
great
benefit.
as
recently
as
1969,
the
fifth
circuit
in
martinez
against
rodriguez
said
the
following.
“we
would
be
remiss
if
we
did
not
once
again,
seize
the
opportunity
to
extol
the
virtues
of
the
florida
certification
procedure.”
for
example,
while
this
court
following
the
footsteps
of
the
stolrich
(ph)
below,
might
have
reached
the
same
conclusion
as
that
of
the
florida
court
with
respect
to
the
issue
in
this
case,
our
decision
would
have
had
no
assurance
of
predictable
correctness.
no
matter
how
many
federal
judges,
trial,
appellate,
three-judge
panel,
or
the
full
panoply
of
the
court
en
banc,
any
decision
would
have
been
an
eerie
guess.
now,
the
guesswork
has
been
eliminated
and
we
are
quickly
presented
with
a
definitive
explication
of
florida
law.
that’s
the
view
of
the
fifth
circuit,
not
just
these
petitioners
and
we
submit
that
this
court
should
reverse
the
decision
below
and
direct
the
second
circuit
also
to
certify
this
question
of
florida
law
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
thank
you.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
these
three
cases
are
here
on
the
grant
of
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
issue
has
been
limited
to
the
question
of
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
failing
to
certify
the
question
of
florida
law
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida
pursuant
to
its
certification
statute.
i
will
speak
for
the
petitioners
in
the
three
cases
which
have
been
consolidated
for
argument
and
i
would
ask
to
reserve
three
minutes
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
it
is
the
position
of
petitioners
here
your
honors
that
it
was
error
for
the
second
circuit
to
refuse
to
certify
the
issue
of
florida
law
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
the
decision
below
exemplifies
a
new
doctrine
on
the
florida
law
or
in
fact
the
law
of
any
state.
although
purporting
to
find
support
under
the
case
of
diamond
against
oreamuno
in
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york,
the
decision
below
here
is
in
fact
a
radical
extension
of
the
diamond
case.
the
question
of
florida
law
here
is
significant
under
the
public
policy
of
florida.
it
involves
a
florida
corporation
and
it
involves
the
regulation
of
that
corporation’s
relationship
to
its
fiduciaries
and
its
shareholders
and
to
those
who
buy
and
sell
its
stock.
the
decision
below
adopted
a
remedy
here
which
could
interfere
with
recovery
by
shareholders
of
that
corporation
when
they
sue
on
an
insider
trading
case.
therefore,
we
can
believe
that
in
light
of
the
significant
question
of
florida
law
and
public
policy
that
was
involved,
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
certified
the
question
as
it
was
requested
to
do
by
judge
kaufman
in
his
dissenting
opinion.
now,
your
honors,
i
would
briefly
discuss
the
underlined
facts
in
this
case
and
the
opinions
below.
this
case
arose
out
of
an
alleged
misuse
of
inside
information
and
subsequent
insider
trading.
lum’s
incorporated
is
a
florida
corporation
which
was
engaged
in
the
fast
food
franchising
business.
during
1969,
in
the
attempt
of
diversification,
it
acquired
a
gambling
casino
in
las
vegas
known
as
caesar’s
palace.
and
to
acquaint
the
financial
community
with
its
new
acquisition,
it
held
what
it
described
as
a
seminar
in
caesar’s
palace
in
november
of
1969.
apparently,
during
that
seminar,
it
released
an
earning’s
forecast
of
a
dollar
to
a
dollar
ten
cents
per
share.
subsequently,
in
january
of
1970,
it
was
alleged
and
when
i
make
these
claims
of
allegations,
i
am
basically
stating
the
allegations
of
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
which
filed
a
complaint
for
injunctive
relief
in
december
1970,
all
of
the
subsequent
civil
cases
are
basically
copies,
if
you
will,
of
the
sec
complaint.
it
was
alleged
that
one
melvin
chasen,
who
was
the
chief
operating
officer
of
lum’s,
learned
of
a
decline,
substantial
decline
in
the
earnings
for
lum’s
second
quarter
that
he
advised
a
mr.
benjamin
simon,
who
was
a
registered
representative
employed
by
lehman
brothers
in
its
chicago
office
of
this
decline.
and
that
mr.
simon
in
turn
passed
on
this
information
to
representatives
of
investors
diversified
services
in
minneapolis.
all
of
these
events
were
alleged
to
have
occurred
on
january
8
and
on
january
9,
two
of
the
ids
funds
sold
83,000
shares
of
lum’s
stock.
trading
was
suspended
on
the
9th.
lum’s
issued
a
press
release
later
in
the
afternoon
announcing
the
decline
in
its
earnings.
when
trading
resumed
the
following
monday,
the
stock
was
off
$3.00
to
$4.00
per
share.
the
sales
on
the
previous
friday,
had
occurred
at
$17.00.
now
the
sec
investigated
and
in
the
following
december,
as
i
said,
they
filed
an
injunction
action
and
that
was
followed
by
a
rash
of
civil
suits
and
those
suits
basically
fell
into
two
categories.
one
category
consisted
of
derivative
actions
seeking
recovery
by
lum's
of
the
trading
profits.
the
second
category
was
a
class
action.
several
suits
constitute,
class
actions
on
behalf
of
sellers
or
purchasers
of
the
stock
on
the
day
of
the
trade-off.
so
at
the
commencement
of
the
litigation
there
were
three
prompts
to
the
regulatory
structure:
the
sec
injunction
action,
the
derivative
suits,
and
the
class
actions.
now,
the
defendants
below
moved
to
dismiss
before
judge
tyler,
the
derivative
actions.
the
derivative
actions
were
premised
on
the
rule
of
diamond
against
oreamuno,
which
is
a
new
york
case
and
that
case
briefly
stated
that
officers
and
directors
of
a
corporation
who
trade
on
inside
information
are
required
to
remit
their
profits
to
the
corporation
even
though
the
corporation
has
not
been
damaged
in
any
legal
sense.
the
court
espoused
this
doctrine
in
the
context
of
a
situation
which
was
really
a
gross
instance
of
misuse
of
corporate
information
the
two
top
officers
of
the
company,
mai
had
learned
of
an
earnings
declined
and
had
sold
their
own
stock
at
triggering
an
enormous
decline
in
the
price
of
the
shares.
as
the
case
reached
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york,
there
were
no
other
actions
pending.
the
sec
had
not
commenced
the
preceding,
section
16
(b)
did
not
apply
because
the
stock
had
been
held
more
than
six
months
and
there
were
no
class
actions
or
any
actions
pending
by
any
of
the
defrauded
purchasers
of
that
stock.
and
so,
the
argument
before
the
court
of
appeals
and
strongly
urged
in
the
brief
by
the
respondent
was
that
if
no
remedy
is
fashioned
here,
these
parties
escaped
with
the
illegal
profits.
that
was
the
context
of
the
diamond
case.
it
is
the
law
in
new
york
to
the
best
of
our
research,
it
has
never
been
cited
or
discussed
in
any
decision
in
any
other
state
court.
it’s
five
years
old
now.
it
came
down
in
1969.
so
the
derivative
suits
here
were
premised
on
the
diamond
case,
but
it
was
the
defendants’
position
that
it
was
the
law
of
florida
that
applied
to
the
responsibility
of
insiders
to
the
corporation.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
the
defendants
your
honor
were
lum's,
the
corporation;
mr.
chasen,
lehman
brothers
and
its
employee
benjamin
simon;
investors
diversified
services
and
two
of
its
funds
and
two
employees
of
ids
who
are
alleged
to
have
receive
the
tip
and
recommended
the
sale
of
the
stock.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
yes,
your
honor,
yes.
they
were
actually
corporate
officers
and
directors
including
directors
who
had
not
actually
made
the
trades,
but
had
acquiesced
in
the
situation
after
they
learned
of
the
matter
and
the
lower
court
had
dismissed
the
case
against
those
directors
and
the
appellate
division
had
affirmed
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
that
point
holding
only
the
wrongdoing
officers
and
directors
[voice

mr.
james
j.
hagan
that’s
correct
your
honor,
that
it
actually
sold
the
shares.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
just
mr.
chasen.
mr.
chasen
was
an
officer
and
also
a
director
of
lum's.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
lehman
brothers
had
no
relationship
to
lum's.
it
was
not
its
investment
advisor.
it
had
not
done
any
investment
banking
for
it.
it
was
really
without
dispute
that
there
was
no
relationship
there.
ids
--
some
of
the
ids
funds
held
the
stock
in
its
portfolio.
other
than
that,
there
was
no
relationship
there
either.
so
the
only
conceivable
nexus
between
our
case
and
diamond
was
mr.
chasen.
now
judge
tyler
as
i
said,
the
defendants
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
florida
law
applied
under
the
law
of
florida.
you
first
must
show
damage
to
your
corporation
before
derivative
suit
will
lie
that
even
under
diamond,
assuming
arguendo
diamond
applied,
there
were
no
profits
here
on
the
part
of
any
defendant
other
than
arguably
the
ids
funds
and
other
than
mr.
chasen
who
had
no
profits,
there
were
no
fiduciaries
involved.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
your
honor,
in
the
lower
court
before
judge
tyler,
the
defendants
argue
that
florida
law
applied
but
the
respondents
disputed
this
point.
they
argued
strenuously
before
judge
tyler
that
new
york
law
applied
and
they
urged
that
the
diamond
rule
be
imposed
and
that
the
rule
will
be
expanded.
and
the
expansion
of
course
has
to
proceed
on
two
grounds.
it
had
to
go
beyond
the
officer
or
director
holding
of
diamond
because
that
was
the
holding
of
diamond.
officers
and
directors
and
the
rationale
was
encouragement
of
private
attorneys
general
to
regulate
the
corporation,
it
was
phrased
in
that
manner.
they
also
have
to
go
beyond
diamond
to
pick
up
parties
who
hadn't
profited
because
again
in
diamond,
only
the
directors
who
actually
profited
had
been
held
liable.
so
there
were
two
extensions
of
diamond
then
in
an
affect
that
they
were
urging
a
rule
which
really
had
very
little
relationship
back
to
the
diamond
case
although
that
was
the
springboard
for
the
argument.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
no,
we
did
not
your
honor.[voice
overlap]
mr.
james
j.
hagan
first
of
all
--
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
the
florida
statute
unlike
other
statutes
in
many
states
only
permits
an
appellate
court
to
certify
the
question.
subsequent
statutes
in
many
of
our
states
that
had
been
adopted
in
the
last
number
of
years
have
adopted
the
recommendation
of
the
uniform
commissioners,
the
uniform
act
and
permit
district
courts
to
certify.
but
in
any
event,
the
question
was
never
raised
before
judge
tyler.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
the
first
request
was
on
the
petition
for
rehearing
before
second
circuit
your
honor,
and
--
mr.
james
j.
hagan
that’s
correct.
judge
kaufman’s
dissent
was
the
first
time,
the
certification
question
is
raised
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
by
any
litigant
or
judge.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
well,
your
honor,
i
think
as
far
as
the
present
petitioners
were
concerned,
it
was
their
position
that
the
law
of
florida
was
not
unclear
or
uncertain.
florida
law,
at
least,
let
me
clarify
that.
it
was
not
unclear
to
the
extent
that
florida’s
law
required
that
you
show
actual
damages
to
your
corporation
before
derivative
suit
would
lie.
the
diamond
case
in
new
york,
flatly
contradicted
that.
it
held
no
damages
--
no
damage
requirement
was
necessary.
secondly,
to
the
extent
that
florida
had
never
discussed
the
diamond
rule,
it
could
have
been
argued
i
suppose
that
it
was
therefore
uncertain.
so
to
that
extent,
you
could
either
say
that
florida
law
was
settled
against
the
respondents
or
uncertain
because
they
had
never
discussed
diamond
and
one
could
only
speculate
what
they
would
do
if
diamond
was
argued
to
them.
but
again,
even
if
you
argued
diamond
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
this
is
not
a
diamond
situation.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
yes,
i
was
getting
to
that,
i
am
sorry
mr.
justice
brennan.
in
the
lower
court,
the
respondents
argued
new
york
law.
judge
tyler
found
florida
law.
on
appeal,
the
respondents
here,
appellants
before
the
second
circuit
conceded
florida
law
applied
and
so
when
mr.
justice
waterman
wrote
his
majority
opinion,
he
pointed
out
both
parties
concede
and
we
so
find
that
florida
law
applied.
although
there
was
a
dispute
in
the
district
court
as
to
the
proper
choice
of
law,
there
was
no
dispute
before
the
second
circuit
on
this
point.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
there
appears
to
be
none
here,
no.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
not
discussed
at
oral
argument
and
not
discussed
in
the
briefs.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
your
honor,
it
was
not
our
position
before
the
second
circuit.
first
of
all,
the
predicate
for
certification
is
a
finding
that
the
law
of
the
state
is
unsettled
or
uncertain
and
it
was
never
our
position
and
it
is
not
our
position
today
actually
that
the
law
of
florida
was
so
uncertain
or
unsettled.
it
became
that
way
for
the
first
time
on
the
opinion
out
of
the
second
circuit.
prior
to
that
opinion,
the
law
of
florida
has
enunciated
in
four
intermediate
appellate
court
opinions
was
that
damages
were
required
in
a
situation
like
this.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
well,
your
honor,
what
the
second
circuit
did
here,
i
submit
was
imposing
new
rule
on
the
law
of
florida.
the
second
circuit
here
adopted
as
florida’s
rule,
a
doctrine
which
no
one
can
find
in
the
law
of
florida.
at
least
none
of
the
parties
that
have
been
able
to
find
it
in
the
law
of
florida.
certainly,
my
friend
from
the
respondents
has
been
unable
to
point
out
any
florida
priorities
and
support
and
the
majority
in
the
second
circuit
agreed
that
there
were
no
florida
precedents
on
point.
it
disregarded,
may
i
say
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
it
disregarded
the
four
decisions
of
the
florida
intermediate
appellate
courts
on
the
damage
point
exemplified
by
palma
against
zerbey
which
was
1966.
it
disregarded
those
in
a
footnote
as
not
persuasive
because
there
had
not
been
any
extensive
discussion
of
the
question
and
there
have
been
a
rather
conclusionary
statement
citing
earlier
opinions
and
the
only
analysis
of
it
is
in
that
footnote
where
the
court
said
it
found
these
cases
not
persuasive
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
florida
law
as
far
as
the
majority
opinion
below
was
concerned.
now
of
course,
our
position
had
been
that
to
that
extent
the
law
is
settled
and
here,
you
cannot
state
a
claim
unless
you
can
prove
damages.
now,
in
any
event,
judge
tyler’s
[voice
overlap]
i
am
sorry
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
to
which
case?
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
oh!
yes,
your
honor.
this
has
happened
here.
this
court,
this
court
has
sua
sponte
certified
questions
on
many
occasions.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
you
did
in
aldrich
and
you
did
in
the
clay
and
you
did
in
dresner
against
city
of
tallahassee.
those
were
--
mr.
james
j.
hagan
i
believe
clay
also
your
honor
was
sua
sponte.
i
don’t
believe
that
anyone
had
requested
certification
there.
in
fact,
i
believe
that’s
the
first
reported
decision
that
i
am
aware
of
where
the
question
arose.
and
this
court
has
as
many
times
of
course
expressed
its
views
on
certification,
the
appropriateness
of
it.
even
those
on
the
court
that
have
express
reservations
about
the
whole
abstention
doctrine
and
the
problems
it
raises
have
often
times
endorse
certification.
in
any
event
--
i
am
sorry,
are
there
any
other
questions
on
that
point?
judge
tyler
found
that
florida
law
applied.
he
found
that
damages
were
required.
he
found
that
although
--
he
decided
the
question
under
diamond
out
of
an
abundance
of
caution
and
said,
even
if
diamond,
the
law
of
florida
did
not
apply
because
none
of
the
party
is
fit
within
the
diamond
rule.
the
ones
that
were
--
the
one
that
was
an
officer
hadn’t
profited.
the
ones
that
profited
were
not
officers
or
directors.
now,
when
the
case
went
up
to
the
second
circuit,
the
majority
in
effect,
they
did
reverse
judge
tyler.
they
found
that
there
was
no
florida
law
on
point.
they
believe
they
had
the
right
to
look
to
the
law
of
other
states,
specifically
new
york
and
the
diamond
rule
and
they
then
extended
the
diamond
rule
in
several
respects.
they
extended
the
concept
of
the
fiduciary
beyond
the
officer
and
director
category
to
pick
up
as
they
put
it
anyone
who
receives
inside
information,
becomes
ipso
facto
a
fiduciary.
although
they
did
not
use
the
term
i
suppose,
the
concept
will
be
something
akin
to
a
constructive
fiduciary
once
you
receive
the
information.
they
then
postulated
a
common
enterprise
theory
and
cited
certain
antitrust
cases
to
support
the
proposition
and
then
said
that
as
in
a
conspiracy
situation
or
a
joint
tort,
all
of
the
defendants
were
liable
for
the
profits
of
anyone.
they
spent
sometime
discussing
the
problems
with
law
of
insider
trading
and
the
necessity
to
tighten
the
doctrine.
judge
kaufman’s
dissent
agreed
of
course
and
there’s
no
issue
here
on
the
condemnation
of
insider
trading.
he
held
however
that
the
majority
had
invented
a
totally
new
concept
of
law,
even
under
the
law
of
new
york,
but
certainly,
it
had
no
basis
in
florida
law.
he
urged
that
the
majority
certify
the
question
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
there
was
no
discussion
in
the
majority
opinion.
it
had
no
response,
it
did
not
respond
to
judge
kaufman’s
comment.
petitions
for
rehearing
were
filed.
it
was
urged
on
the
court
that
the
matter
would
be
certified,
but
it
was
not
denied
and
we
are
now
here
on
certiorari.
and
we
urge
your
honor
that
it
was
error
for
the
court
to
refuse
to
certify
in
this
area.
this
decision
has
imposed
in
effect
a
new
regulatory
framework
upon
trading
in
the
stock
of
florida
corporations.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
we
believe
it
would
be
your
honor.
of
course
we
don’t
--
mr.
james
j.
hagan
well,
your
honor,
we
feel
that
under
this
court’s
decision
in
thibodaux
and
kaiser
steel,
this
would
be
the
type
of
question.
there
is
no
neat
characterization
of
when
a
question
like
this
can
really
be
said
to
support
abstention,
but
we
believe
that
even,
if
you
did
not
have
a
certification
statute,
a
strong
argument
could
be
made
here
for
abstention
because
of
the
policy
questions
involved.
after
all,
this
is
a
florida
corporation.
the
state
of
florida
has
expressed
its
own
public
policy
by
adopting
a
certification
statute,
the
first
state
to
do
so
in
1945.
but
it
would
like
to
have
a
say
in
what
the
law
of
florida
is
and
for
a
court
--
a
federal
court
to
discuss
the
duties
and
liabilities
flowing
from
certain
factual
situations
involving
a
florida
corporation
it
seems
to
me
raise
--
mr.
james
j.
hagan
that
is,
you’re
right.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
that
is
our
position
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
i
think
that
makes
our
case
much
stronger,
your
honor
because
--
mr.
james
j.
hagan
well,
because
in
those
situations,
presumably,
the
federal
court
sitting
in
those
districts
would
be
knowledgeable
in
the
law
of
the
jurisdiction.
the
district
court
sitting
in
louisiana
can
be
presumed
to
be
more
knowledgeable
of
louisiana
law
than
say
at
new
york
federal
court
and
it
is
rather
ironic
here
your
honor
to
think
that
if
this
case
had
arisen
in
the
fifth
circuit
within
which
florida
lies,
this
question
would
undoubtedly,
if
one
can
read
the
fifth
circuit
precedents
correct,
it
would
have
been
certified
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
the
fifth
circuit
has
used
this
procedure
on
many
occasions.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
your
honor,
here,
if
a
state
has
a
certification
statute
and
today,
12
states
do
and
there
has
been
quite
a
trend
here
in
the
last
number
of
years,
depending
upon
whether
the
statute
of
the
state
permits
district
court
certification
or
appellate
court
certification,
the
parties
frame
a
certified
question
to
the
court
of
that
state.
the
briefing
--
there
is
a
briefing
period
of
60
days
at
least
under
the
florida
statute.
the
question
is
presented,
the
parties
brief
it,
oral
argument
is
optional
and
then
the
certifying
court
responds
back
and
answers
the
law
of
florida
in
this
situation
as
does
itself.
that
is
reported
back
to
the
federal
court.
this
raises
none
of
the
problems
that
have
plagued
the
courts
and
over
the
number
of
years
since
the
abstention
doctrine
was
first
enunciated.
first
of
all,
the
delay
problem
is
minimized.
you
don’t
hear
of
a
situation
where
you
have
to
proceed
in
the
lower
court
and
up
to
the
appellate
procedures
in
the
state.
you
go
directly
to
the
supreme
court
of
that
state
for
a
final
and
definitive
ruling
on
the
law.
but
i
would
say,
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
here,
if
the
fifth
circuit
had
had
this,
i
am
sure
it
would
have
been
certified.
as
the
fact
that
the
second
circuit
had
it
and
did
not
certify
it
when
presumably
it
is
not
that
knowledgeable
on
florida
law
is
even
stronger
case
for
certification.
if
i
might,
i
would
like
to
briefly
discuss
the
trend
here
which
i
think
is
important
your
honors
because
there
has
been
since
1960s,
since
this
court
first
used
the
certification
doctrine,
there
has
been
a
development
here
which
i
know
this
court
is
aware
of
and
if
in
fairness,
the
court
disagrees
with
this
trend,
presumably,
this
would
be
the
case
to
discuss
it
because
since
1960
in
the
clay
case.
when
there
was
only
one
state
with
the
certification
statue,
this
court
followed
up
with
certification,
suggestions
and
aldrich
and
dresner
in
1963.
in
1964
in
his
concurrence
in
the
england
case,
mr.
justice
douglas
although
expressing
strong
reservations
about
the
abstention
doctrine,
strongly
endorsed
certification
as
a
possible
solution
to
these
problems.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
now,
we
have
12,
your
honor.
we
had
10
in
our
main
brief
and
we
actually
picked
up
two
more
in
our
reply
brief.
minnesota
and
oklahoma
adopted
at
the
73
sessions
and
we
have
cited
those
in
our
reply
brief.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
basically
yes.
because
in
1965,
you
had
fours
states
adopt
hawaii,
maine,
new
hampshire
and
washington.
there
was
some
difference
among
them,
but
in
1967,
a
uniform
act
was
adopted
by
the
commissioners
of
state
laws.
this
was
basically
the
florida
statute
with
some
minor
variations.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
it
goes
to
the
district
court
also,
from
its
district
court
certification.
it
was
approved
by
the
aba
in
1967,
by
the
ali
(american
law
institute)
in
1969
and
since
that
time,
you
had
a
number
of
other
states
so
that
you
now
have
12
states
that
have
adopted
this
doctrine.
and
so
we
submit,
this
was
a
proper
case
for
certification.
it
should
have
been
certified
and
the
failure
to
do
so
when
requested
by
judge
kaufman
was
error
sufficient
to
justify
reversal
and
remand.
i
will
now
stop.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
yes.
they
really
don’t
--
they
don’t
really
extend
to
that
problem
that
we
have
in
england,
the
danger
of
deciding
the
federal
question
and
the
res
judicata
problem
that
arises.
they
are
limited
to
the
question
of
state
law
and
where
the
question
of
state
law
maybe
determinative
of
the
issue,
not
just
--
mr.
james
j.
hagan
yes,
yes.
that’s
right,
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
hagan
your
honors,
i
believe
that
mr.
ruby
has
overstated
the
position
of
the
petitioners
here
and
overstated
the
argument.
we
do
not
argue
here
for
abstention.
his
entire
argument
in
rebuttal
and
response
is
based
on
an
abstention
argument
on
the
behalf
of
the
petitioners.
of
course,
this
does
not
take
away
the
right
of
any
party
that
went
to
federal
court.
the
argument
in
favor
of
certification
is
that,
it
preserves
that
right.
that
federal
fact
finding
is
available,
federal
rules
of
discovery
are
available.
the
only
issue
that
is
certified
is
the
issue
of
state
law
and
it
is
found
by
the
federal
court
in
the
same
manner
many
other
things
are
found
in
the
litigation.
in
this
case,
the
question
of
florida
law
almost
becomes
in
effect
a
fact
to
be
found
by
utilizing
the
certification
statute.
they
argue
merit
and
they
are
setting
up
a
straw
man
here.
we
do
not
claim
abstention.
there
is
no
need
for
it.
that
is
in
effect
the
beauty
of
the
new
certification
statutes.
these
arguments
that
have
plagued
the
courts
and
the
commentators
for
20
or
30
years,
may
in
the
future
start
to
alleviate
because
abstention
in
this
area
may
not
be
necessary
anymore.
mr.
justice
marshall
as
well,
pointed
out
that
their
basic
position
is
that
certification
is
not
justified
in
any
case
because
obviously,
you
always
have
delay.
the
delay
involved
maybe
several
months,
it
maybe
six
months
or
more,
but
i
would
say
that
the
answer
to
this
delay
argument
which
is
always
brought
up
by
the
party
opposing
either
abstention
or
certification
was
well
answered
by
this
court
back
in
1942
in
fieldcrest
dairies,
where
mr.
justice
douglas
said,
considerations
of
delay
inconvenience
and
cost
to
the
parties
which
have
been
urged
upon
us,
do
not
call
for
a
different
result.
they
were
there
granting
abstention.
what
we
are
here
concerned
with
the
much
larger
issue
as
to
the
appropriate
relationship
between
federal
and
state
authorities,
functioning
as
a
harmonious
whole
and
that
issue
is
exactly
before
the
court
today.
the
problems
that
have
been
raised
by
abstention
over
the
years
have
now
started
to
result
in
the
statutory
certification
process
and
i
submit
that
the
court
should
now
encourage
it.
and
finally,
this
point
that
who
gets
certification,
whether
you
grant
certification
should
almost
be
a
form
of
gamesmanship
as
to
who
asks
first
or
who
does
not
ask
for
it
is
simply
inappropriate.
when
we
were
before
the
second
circuit,
we
were
parties
to
a
litigation
where
our
view
was
that
florida
law
did
not
support
the
claim
and
the
district
court
had
so
found
and
respondents
here
were
unable
to
cite
a
single
florida
case
supporting
their
position.
it
was
not
our
position
before
the
second
circuit
that
florida
law
was
so
uncertain
as
to
require
certification.
it
became
that
way
when
the
majority
here
developed
a
doctrine
it
did.
only
then
that
the
question
of
certification,
come
to
the
forefront.
prior
to
that
time,
our
position
was
not
that
the
law
of
florida
was
unsettled
or
uncertain.
now,
with
all
of
the
problems
mr.
ruby
points
out
about
classical
abstention,
certainly
the
court
that
has
had
the
most
experience
with
certification
in
a
federal
context
has
not
found
it
to
be
a
burden
and
has
found
it
in
fact
to
be
a
great
benefit.
as
recently
as
1969,
the
fifth
circuit
in
martinez
against
rodriguez
said
the
following.
“we
would
be
remiss
if
we
did
not
once
again,
seize
the
opportunity
to
extol
the
virtues
of
the
florida
certification
procedure.”
for
example,
while
this
court
following
the
footsteps
of
the
stolrich
(ph)
below,
might
have
reached
the
same
conclusion
as
that
of
the
florida
court
with
respect
to
the
issue
in
this
case,
our
decision
would
have
had
no
assurance
of
predictable
correctness.
no
matter
how
many
federal
judges,
trial,
appellate,
three-judge
panel,
or
the
full
panoply
of
the
court
en
banc,
any
decision
would
have
been
an
eerie
guess.
now,
the
guesswork
has
been
eliminated
and
we
are
quickly
presented
with
a
definitive
explication
of
florida
law.
that’s
the
view
of
the
fifth
circuit,
not
just
these
petitioners
and
we
submit
that
this
court
should
reverse
the
decision
below
and
direct
the
second
circuit
also
to
certify
this
question
of
florida
law
to
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
thank
you.
