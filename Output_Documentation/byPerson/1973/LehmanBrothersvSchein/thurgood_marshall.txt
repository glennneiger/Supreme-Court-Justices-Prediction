marshall
mr.
ruby,
before
you
get
to
that.
once
judge
kaufman
raised
a
certified
question
point,
is
it
significant
that
the
other
two
members
of
panel
did
not
say
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
can’t
find
from
their
minds
that
they
didn’t
care
to
comment
to
apply
that
up.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
they
did
not
make
ruling
on
this
though,
did
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
but
they
did
not
say
that
we
find
that
this
is
not
the
proper
case
to
be
certified,
they
never
said
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
they
didn’t
give
any
reasons.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
reason
do
you
think
could
be
imagined
to
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
reason
can
you
imagine
would
be
necessary
to
have
the
question
certified?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
you
argue
if
you
don’t
certify
any?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
not
arguing
that,
are
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
you
don’t
do
it
only
in
diversity
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
ruby,
what
happens
if
the
supreme
court
of
florida
this
morning
renders
an
opinion
in
another
case
on
all
four
but
this
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
am
just
talking
about
this
case,
you
decide
it
on
florida
law
and
this
opinion
comes
down
and
a
week
later
the
florida
court
has
identical
case
on
all
four
and
say
in
its
opinion
says,
the
second
circuit
was
just
completely
wrong
in
this
interpretation
of
florida
law.
does
that
do
anything
for
good
judicial
precedent?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
isn’t
that
what
this
is
for,
is
to

happen,
could
it?
if
the
question
had
been
certified,
it
could
not
happen.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
still
agree
that
florida
law
controls?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
you
ever
run
across
an
sec
case
that
took
less
than
three
years?
