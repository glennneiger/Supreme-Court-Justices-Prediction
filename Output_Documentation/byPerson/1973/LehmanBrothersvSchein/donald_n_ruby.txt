mr.
donald
n.
ruby
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
petitioner
has
acknowledged
this
morning
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
committed
reversible
error
in
this
action
which
is
based
upon
diversity
jurisdiction
in
deciding
the
question
of
florida
common
law,
rather
than
certifying
it
to
the
florida
supreme
court,
pursuant
to
florida’s
optional
certification
procedure.
this
court
denied
the
petitioners’
request
that
it
review
the
merits
of
this
decision
or
whether
the
court
below
violated
the
principles
of
erie
against
tompkins
in
reaching
its
decision.
petitioners,
i
suggest,
no
doubt
recognizing
the
weakness
of
their
position
on
the
question
which
is
before
this
court
had
nevertheless
argued
the
merits
of
this
decision
at
great
length
in
their
brief
and
also
this
morning.
since
the
merits
itself
of
the
decision
are
not
before
the
court,
i
shall
not
address
myself
to
them
this
morning,
but
i
would
say
only
in
passing
that
an
examination
of
the
decision
below,
i
think,
clearly
reveals
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
was
quite
mindful
of
its
obligations
under
erie
to
decide
this
case
under
florida
law
and
that
the
court’s
decision
is
well
supported
by
authorities,
including
florida
case
law
and
i
might
add
they
cited
a
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court
in
support
of
their
decision.
petitioner
referred
to
four
cases
in
his
oral
argument
which
he
alleges
the
court
of
appeals
disregarded
or
overlooked.
i
might
say
only
in
commenting
upon
that
that
only
one
of
these
cases
was
even
cited
by
the
petitioners
to
the
court
of
appeals,
three
of
them
have
been
referred
to
in
their
brief
to
this
court,
but
were
not
even
included
in
their
brief
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
i
would
not
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
believed
that
the
question
was
settled.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
but
i
am
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
well,
i
think
there
is
a
threshold
question
if
i
may
answer
your
question
in
this
fashion.
i
think
the
basic
question
is,
is
this
an
appropriate
case
for
certification?
now
in
that,
judge
kaufman
in
his
dissent
did
make
a
passing
reference
to
the
possibility
of
certification.
i
would
assume
that
the
court
in
their
deliberations
probably
considered
the
whole
question
and
they
may
have
come
to
the
conclusion
and
i
believe
that
it
is
well
supported,
this
was
not
an
appropriate
case
for
certification.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
and
i
might
also
say,
since
i
think
you’ve
really
brought
this
point
up.
petitioner
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
florida
legislature
has
enacted
this
certification
statute
and
suggested
to
this
court
that
that
is
a
reason
for
having
a
federal
court
in
effect
to
abstain
through
certification
in
a
diversity
case.
first
of
all,
the
florida
statute
of
course
is
optional
in
the
sense
that
it
leaves
it
up
to
the
federal
court
to
decide
what
to
do.
but
i
think
the
more
important
answer
is,
that
the
florida
legislature
cannot
by
enacting
the
statute,
take
away
the
rights
which
are
given
to
litigants
under
the
diversity
of
jurisdiction
statute
to
go
into
a
federal
court
and
to
have
their
claims
adjudicated
there.
and
whether
they
have
that
right,
and
whether
the
court
erred
in
this
case,
i
think,
must
be
determined
under
federal
law
which
i
will
come
to.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
well,
your
honor,
i
cannot
of
course
search
into
the
minds
of
the
other
two
judges,
but
i
would
assume
from
the
fact
that
they
didn’t
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
yes,
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
i
would
say
that
in
effect,
they
made
a
ruling
by
deciding
the
case.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
they
did
not
say
it
in
those
words
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
i
would
say
the
clear
inference
from
the
fact
that
they
did
go
ahead
and
decided
the
case
on
the
merits
that
they
determined
that
this
was
not
an
appropriate
case
for
certification.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
they
did
not
express
any
reasons,
that
is
correct.
the
basic
rule
turning
to
the
federal
law,
governing
the
obligation
of
federal
courts
to
decide
question
of
state
law
in
actions
based
upon
diversity
jurisdiction
was
of
course
set
forth
by
this
court
in
the
meredith
case,
which
is
generally
regarded
as
a
landmark
decision,
covering
the
obligation
of
federal
courts
to
decide
questions
of
state
law
in
diversity
cases.
this
court
said
and
i
will
quote
briefly,
“it
has
from
the
first
been
deemed
to
be
the
duty
of
the
federal
courts,
if
their
jurisdiction
is
properly
invoked,
to
decide
questions
of
state
law
whenever
necessary
to
the
rendition
of
judgment.”
this
court
then
went
on
to
say
that
in
the
absence
of
exceptional
circumstances,
a
failure
to
decide
such
questions
of
state
law,
and
again
i
quote,
“merely
because
the
answers
to
the
questions
of
state
law
are
difficult
or
have
not
yet
been
given
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
would
thwart
the
purposes
of
the
jurisdictional
act.”
now,
the
principles
that
have
been
set
forth
by
meredith
have
been
reaffirmed
by
this
court
on
several
occasions.
in
propper
against
clark,
this
court
indicated
that
to
allow
the
difficulty
of
an
issue
of
a
state
law
to
deter
a
federal
court
from
deciding
the
issue
of
state
law
in
a
diversity
case
would
be
and
again
i
quote
“to
enervate
diversity
jurisdiction”.
again
in
mcneese
against
the
board
of
education,
this
court
noted
that
in
a
diversity
of
citizenship
case
and
i
quote
“we
hold
that
difficulties
and
perplexities
of
state
law
are
no
reason
for
referral
of
the
problem
to
the
state
court.”
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
well,
your
honor
i
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
no,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
no,
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
that
certification
is
a
form
of
abstention.
in
effect
by
certifying
the
question,
the
federal
court
abdicates
its
responsibility
to
decide
the
question
of
state
law
in
a
diversity
case
and
it
submits
the
issue
to
the
state
court.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
you
do
it
your
honor
in
a
case
we
submit
which
would
be
a
proper
case
for
abstention,
since
it
is
in
effect
a
form
of
abstention.
now,
it
may
be
preferable
to
outright
dismissal
as
a
form
of
abstention,
but
i
think
the
question
remains
whether
it
is
proper
for
the
federal
court
at
all
to
abstain
from
deciding
the
case
in
a
diversity
case
and
to
submit
the
issue
into
a
state
court.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
it
retains
jurisdiction
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
nevertheless,
is
abstention
in
the
sense
that
if
the
duty
of
the
federal
courts
under
the
jurisdictional
act
is
to
decide
all
questions
necessary
to
the
adjudication
of
a
judgment
in
a
diversity
case
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
i
think
there
is
no
incompatibility
your
honor
if
it’s
a
proper
case
for
a
federal
court
to
say
to
the
litigants,
we
will
not
decide
your
issue.
i
think,
if
we
have
to
choose
between
for
example,
outright
dismissal
and
certification,
there
is
no
question
that
the
certification
statute
may
serve
a
useful
purpose
and
of
course,
many
commentators
have
indicated
that
in
such
circumstances,
it
does
serve
a
useful
purpose.
but
i
would
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
in
effect
the
general
proposition
where
the
certification
may
serve
a
useful
function.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
there’s
no
question
about
that
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
there
is
no
case
directly
your
honor.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
i
think
that’s
true,
your
honor,
but
i
think
you
do
so
--
and
what
you
would
give
up
i
think
is
really
what
has
to
be
considered
[voice
overlap]
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
what
i
think,
what
you
give
up,
i
think
first
of
all
and
perhaps
it’s
more
than
just
giving
up
something.
i
think
it
does
represent
a
disregard
of
what
the
duty
is
on
the
federal
courts
under
the
diversity
of
citizenship
act.
i
believe
that
imposed
upon
the
federal
courts
by
congress
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
well,
first
of
all,
of
course
they
are
not
deciding
the
case
themselves.
now,
i
won’t
delay
to
this
point
but
i
have
--[voice
overlap]
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
that’s
correct.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
that’s
true
your
honor
and
i
think
this
court
has
considered
this
kind
of
situation
in
other
cases
if
i
might
for
example,
perhaps
in
responding
to
you
refer
to
what
this
court
said
in
the
propper
against
clark
case.
in
that
case,
i
think
this
court
clearly
indicated
that
a
federal
court
should
not
submit
questions
of
state
law
to
a
state
court
where
the
federal
courts
have
been
granted
jurisdiction
of
the
controversy
in
the
absence
of
special
circumstances
and
if
i
quote
briefly
from
it,
the
submission
of
special
issues
and
in
effect,
we
are
talking
here
about
a
special
issue,
is
a
useful
device
in
judicial
administration
in
sub-circumstances
as
existed
and
then
it
refers
to
magnolia,
spector,
fieldcrest,
and
pullman,
those
were
all
classic
abstention
cases.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
your
honor,
i
suppose
an
application
could
be
made
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
unlikely
event
and
i
recognize
that
there
are
instances
which
occur
where
federal
court
may
decide
a
case
and
then
subsequently,
a
state
court
may
decide
it
differently.
that
is
a
problem
that
is
involved
not
only
in
the
diversity
area,
it's
involved
in
every
case
where
you
have
conflicts
of
all
law
rule,
where
one
state
has
to
decide
what
another
state
would
do.
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
might
add
if
this
case
has
been
brought
for
example
in
the
state
courts
of
new
york
which
it
might
have.
the
new
york
state
courts
would
have
had
the
obligation
under
their
conflicts
of
law
rule
to
decide
what
florida
law
was
and
then
to
apply
it.
now,
of
course
there
is
always
the
danger
that
their
decision
could
be
wrong.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
well,
certainly
not
your
honor,
certainly
not.
that
is
a
problem
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
it
could
not
happen
if
the
question
was
certified,
but
your
honor
if
the
question
was
certified,
not
only
would
you
have
what
i
would
refer
to
is
ineffective
denial
of
the
rights
under
diversity
jurisdiction,
but
you
have
what
this
court
i
think
has
talked
about
time
and
time
again
the
desire
not
to
compel
litigants
to
go
down
as
i
--
if
i
may
borrow
the
phrase
for
mr.
justice
douglas,
“a
long
and
expensive
road
to
obtain
an
adjudication
in
the
case
that
they
have
brought.”
now,
the
delay
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
yes
mr.
justice
brennan,
clay
was
a
classic
abstention
case.
the
fifth
circuit
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
precisely,
precisely,
and
in
clay
your
honor.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
neither
aldrich
nor
dresner
were
even
diversity
cases.
that
in
both
of
those
case
you
had
a
problem
in
one
case
about
due
process
under
the
federal
constitution
which
could
be
avoided
and
in
the
other
case,
you
had
an
interpretation
of
the
full
faith
in
credit
cause.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
yes,
that
is
correct.
so
both
of
those
cases
really
don’t
support
the
proposition
in
this
case
because
they
involve
the
classic
type
of
abstention.
if
i
might
just
continue
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
believe
that
one
of
the
real
problems
in
any
kind
of
abstention
including
certification
is
the
delay
and
the
extra
burdens,
the
added
expense.
now
certification
may
lessen
those
burdens,
but
it
certainly
doesn’t
eliminate
them.
it’s
been
reported
that
certification
to
the
state
of
florida
increases
the
length
of
a
case
maybe
by
at
least
a
year.
it
in
affect
produces
two
full
dress
appeals
where
one
had
taken
place
before
and
i
might
say
that
this
particular
case
is
really
a
inappropriate
case
to
permit
this
kind
of
certification
since
the
delay
involved
here
is
even
more
pronounced
because
of
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
here
did
not
even
request
certification.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
yes,
they
do
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
they
have
a
full
dress
appeal.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
that’s
correct,
that’s
correct.
in
this
case,
the
petitioners'
in
effect
allowed
the
parties
and
the
court
to
go
through
the
whole
appeal
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
they
allow
the
court
to
deliberate
to
reach
its
decision
and
then
finally,
ceasing
upon
really,
what
mr.
justice
--
justice
kaufman
had
added
in
his
opinion
because
his
main
part
of
his
opinion
is,
he
dissented
on
the
merits.
however,
he
added
at
the
end
that
perhaps
certification
should
have
been
used.
ceasing
upon
that,
the
petitioners
then
made
a
motion
for
rehearing
and
i
think
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
even
in
their
petition
for
rehearing,
they
did
not
come
out
in
a
forth
right
way
and
say,
this
case
should
be
certified.
they
asked
for
a
rehearing
en
banc
on
the
merits
in
effect,
asking
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
again
to
decide
the
case
on
the
merits
and
then
in
the
final
paragraph
of
the
12-page
petition
for
rehearing,
in
effect
what
they
said
is,
that
if
you
are
not
going
to
decide
in
our
favor,
then
please
send
the
case
down
to
the
state
of
florida.
i
might
say
perhaps
in
support
of
some
of
the
points
i
said
before
that
commentators
have
said
in
many
instances
and
i
refer
to
professor
wright
as
an
example
of
this,
that
certification
and
i
quote
is,
“an
undesirable
innovation”
if
it
will
lead
to
an
abrogation
of
the
merit
of
doctrine
and
similar
expressions
are
found
in
other
commentaries.
the
threshold
question
i
would
submit
to
this
court
is
whether
this
was
basically
a
case
for
abstention
of
any
kind
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
nature
of
the
case
and
the
instances
in
which
this
court
has
granted
abstention,
i
think
it’s
clear,
it’s
not.
there
is
no
constitutional
question
that
can
be
avoided
in
this
case.
there
is
no
constitutional
question
involved.
there
is
no
state
regulatory
scheme
involved
and
try
as
they
may,
the
petitioners
attempt
to
create
some
kind
of
regulatory
scheme
and
yet
the
issue
in
this
case,
essentially
involves
the
breach
of
a
fiduciary
duty
or
an
alleged
breach
of
a
fiduciary
duty.
i
suppose
if
certification
were
appropriate
or
abstention
were
appropriate.
in
this
case,
one
might
say,
then
in
virtually
any
case
where
one
alleges
a
breach
of
a
fiduciary
duty
if
there
is
an
unsettled
issue
of
law,
that
that’s
a
proper
case
for
certification.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
there
is
no
question
about
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
under
the
erie
case,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
recognized
that
and
it
did
its
duty,
i
would
submit
under
erie
as
required
by
congress
under
the
diversity
of
jurisdiction
act
to
decide
the
case
unless
there
was
special
circumstances
which
this
court
has
said
warranted
abstention.
now,
no
one
in
this
case
was
asking
a
federal
court
to
in
effect
enjoin
state
officials
from
carrying
out
their
act.
there
was
no
peculiar
local
issue
involved
here
such
as
eminent
domain
that
was
involved
with
thibodaux.
there
was
no
issue
here
as
there
was
in
the
kaiser
case
involving
the
control
of
vital
natural
resources.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
main
issue
in
this
case
is
not
even
the
propriety
of
the
petitioners’
conduct.
even
the
petitioners
have
conceded
here
that
the
act
that
was
committed
that
is
trading
with
inside
information
has
been
subject
to
universal
condemnation
so
that
we
are
not
even
talking
as
we
are
in
most
abstention
cases
with
whether
certain
conduct
within
a
state
is
proper
or
not.
what
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
lum’s
should
have
a
remedy
to
recover
the
profits
which
were
made
by
these
defendants
as
a
result
of
their
alleged
trading
with
the
use
of
confidential
corporate
information.
we
would
submit
only
to
the
court
on
this
point
that
it
cannot
be
seriously
urged
that
it
is
the
public
policy
of
florida
that
a
person
should
be
permitted
to
engage
in
trading
with
confidential
corporate
information
in
the
stock
of
florida
corporations
and
that
the
decision
in
this
case
will
interfere
with
that
public
policy.
therefore,
we
would
submit
that
this
case
does
not
present
the
classic
conflicts
or
special
circumstances
which
would
have
warranted
abstention.
i
would
say
recognizing
really
that
this
is
not
a
proper
abstention
case,
the
main
thrust
of
the
petitioners’
argument
is
that
any
case
which
involves
an
unsettled
issue
of
law,
of
state
law
is
a
case
which
is
a
proper
case
for
certification
and
they
go
even
further.
they
say
if
the
court
does
not
certify
even
if
it
was
never
even
requested
to
do
so
that
it
has
a
committed
error.
i
think
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that,
and
if
i
may
borrow
a
phrase
from
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
is
a
very
narrow
corridor
through
which
a
federal
court
may
escape
from
its
obligation
to
decide
state
law
questions
when
federal
jurisdiction
is
properly
invoked.
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
to
accept
the
petitioners’
contention
that
where
there
is
an
unsettled
issue
of
state
law
and
i
might
say
parenthetically
in
a
majority
of
cases,
it
might
be
reasonably
contended
that
the
state
law
issue
is
not
settled,
that
this
would
be
to
open
the
door
wide
and
really
to
turn
this
narrow
corridor
which
the
court
has
very
carefully
limited
into
what
i
think
might
be
described
as
really
a
wide
canyon
and
i
think
these
are
the
clear
implications
of
the
petitioners’
argument.
there
is
no
support
that
the
petitioners
can
gain
as
i
have
indicated
from
either
the
clay
case
or
dresner
or
aldrich,
since
in
those
cases,
you
were
dealing
with
classic
abstention
cases
and
in
fact,
aldrich
and
dresner
were
not
even
diversity
cases.
in
clay,
i
think
it’s
also
appropriate
to
note
and
i
have
referred
to
this,
the
remarks
by
mr.
justice
douglas
where
he
gave
protest
to
the
practice
of
making
litigants
travel
a
long
and
expensive
road
in
order
to
obtain
justice.
and
i
think
in
this
case,
i
might
add
the
case
is
already
been
pending
three
years,
certification
will
now
require
the
parties
to
perhaps
spend
another
year
on
an
appellate
level
by
going
down
to
florida.
if
certification
is
appropriate
here,
it
may
well
be
appropriate
after
trial,
assuming
that
the
plaintiff
prevail
on
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
the
proof
in
this
case
may
be
different
than
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
the
issue
may
arise,
have
the
plaintiffs’
prove
the
case
under
florida
law
and
again,
the
argument
could
be
made
that
that
is
an
issue
that
should
be
certified
and
the
case
may
go
on
for
many
more
years
with
the
consequent
burdens
to
the
parties
as
a
result
of
that.
i
think
this
should
be
justified
only
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
i
suppose
your
honor
only
where
there’s
consent
judgments,
[attempt
to
laughter]
but
generally
not.
but
i
think
nevertheless
the
object
here
is
certainly
not
to
increase
the
time
or
expense
to
the
litigants.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
i
am
sorry.
i'm
mr.
ruby.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
they
are,
your
honor,
and
they
were
also
of
course
parties
to
the
action
brought
by
the
sec.
i
might
say,
in
that,
there
was
a
consent
judgment
by
the
mutual
fund
defendants,
they
consented
to
judgment
against
them.
lehman
brothers
went
to
trial
and
the
district
court
found
that
they
were
not
liable
on
the
limited
ground
that
they
were
not
responsible
for
their
agent
who
is
the
one,
who
in
effect
passed
on
the
information.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
i
believe,
they
are
still
pending,
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
this
precise
data.
i
know
that
they
are
still
pending
and
being
litigated.
as
i
have
indicated
the
floor,
i
would
like
to
just
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
equities
of
this
case.
i
think
this
is
a
particularly
inappropriate
case
i
would
submit
to
the
court
to
find
that
the
court
below
erred
in
not
certifying
where
the
petition
is
never
even
requested
certification
before
the
adverse
decision
on
the
merits.
this
court
has
said
i
think
time
and
time
again
that
such
a
procedure
is
to
be
criticized
and
certainly
should
not
be
sanctioned
where
one
goes
into
court,
submits
his
rights
to
a
court,
gets
an
adverse
decision
and
then
wants
to
go
to
another
court
to
litigate
the
same
issues.
in
the
hostetter
case,
in
holding
that
it
was
not
error
in
not
abstaining.
this
court
referred
to
the
fact
that
neither
party
had
requested
it.
in
the
england
case
in
somewhat
different
circumstances,
this
court
indicated
that
where
a
party
like
the
petitioners
freely
litigates
his
claims
in
one
court
even
though
he
may
not
be
required
to
do
so,
he
should
not
be
allowed
to
ignore
the
adverse
decision
and
then
start
all
over
to
another
court.
that’s
precisely
what
the
petitioners
are
seeking
to
do
here
and
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
aptly
noted,
we
would
not
be
here
today
seeking
certification
if
the
petitioners
had
prevailed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
this
court
in
england
said
that
such
a
procedure,
the
kind
that
the
petitioners
are
seeking
to
follow
now
would
countenance
and
unnecessary
increase
in
the
length
and
cost
of
litigation
and
there
are
many
other
cases
along
those
lines.
those
cases
involving
disqualification
of
a
judge
or
court
indicate
that
a
litigant
cannot
experiment
with
the
court
to
see
what
happens.
so
this
is
precisely
what
the
petitioners
have
done
here.
they
were
quite
willing
to
let
the
court
of
appeals
decide
the
case,
but
then
when
it
was
decided
against
them,
after
they
so
to
speak
tested
the
water,
found
it
not
to
their
liking,
then
they
urged
that
the
court
should
not
have
decided
the
case
to
begin
with.
mr.
hagan
this
morning,
in
his
reply
brief,
i
think
made
a
remarkable
statement.
in
response
to
mr.
rehnquist's
question,
he
said
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
certification
until
after
the
decision
below
since
the
law
of
florida
was
not
debatable
or
uncertain.
i
might
say
in
passing
if
the
law
wasn’t
uncertain
then
you
wouldn’t
even
have
a
proper
case
for
certification.
but
the
implication
of
what
the
petitioners
are
saying
is,
that
you
do
not
even
determine
whether
certification
is
appropriate
by
considering
the
nature
of
the
case
or
the
issues
before
decision.
what
you
do
is
that,
after
the
decision,
you
look
at
the
decision
and
if
you
think
that
it
is
wrong,
then
you
argue
that
certification
should
have
taken
place.
i
would
suggest
respectfully
to
the
court
that
this
procedure
has
nothing
to
commend
it
and
then
certainly
should
not
be
sanctioned
by
this
court
in
this
case.
one
further
point
on
the
procedure,
the
petition
has
attempted
in
their
reply
brief
to
overcome
the
obvious
inequity
of
the
procedure
they
followed
by
making
reference
to
the
decision
in
the
kaiser
case
where
after
an
adverse
decision,
the
petitioner
made
a
motion,
asking
the
court
of
appeals
to
abstain
pending
a
determination
in
a
pending
declaratory
judgment
action
in
the
state.
the
tenth
circuit
denied
that
motion
with
judge
brown
who
was
sitting
by
designation
from
the
fifth
circuit
dissenting.
the
kaiser
case,
however,
this
court
then
of
course
went
on
to
reverse
and
ordered
abstention,
the
kaiser
case
however,
certainly
is
a
different
kind
of
case
and
doesn’t
sanction
the
kind
of
procedure
that
the
petitioners
have
followed
here.
kaiser
was
a
classic
abstention
case.
you
were
dealing
there
with
the
law
of
eminent
domain.
you
are
dealing
there
with
the
control
of
a
vital
natural
resource,
water
within
the
state
of
new
mexico.
even
the
attorney
general
of
new
mexico
had
to
come
in
and
asked
and
the
abstention
take
place.
where
you
have
this
classic
abstention
case
then
the
fact
that
the
litigant
did
not
ask
for
certification
perhaps
is
not
determinative
because
there
you
were
dealing
with
great
public
stakes
and
if
i
will
close
just
by
referring
with
judge
brown
said
in
his
dissent
in
the
tenth
circuit.
he
said,
if
we
were
not
dealing
with
serious
matters
of
great
public
moment
and
importance
to
new
mexico,
i
would
be
quite
willing
to
say
to
kaiser
that
it
must
live
with
the
consequences
of
a
federal
court
diversity
jurisdiction.
and
finally,
he
went
on
to
say,
similarly,
the
fact
that
the
motion
is
now
made
after
the
adverse
decision
of
this
court,
while
a
powerful
circumstance
in
many
situations
does
not
prevent
the
exercise
of
abstention
now
in
view
of
this
great
public
stakes
and
i
would
only
urge
this
court
that
here
where
we
are
not
dealing
with
those
great
public
stakes
of
considerations
that
are
present
in
abstention
that
the
failure
to
request
certification
before
an
adverse
decision
should
either
constitute
a
waiver
or
bar
to
argue
that
the
court
erred
in
not
doing
so
or
at
the
very
least
should
represent
in
judge
brown’s
word
a
powerful
circumstance
in
determining
whether
the
court
of
appeals,
assuming
it
had
any
discretion
to
certify,
abused
that
discretion.
we
submit
that
it
did
not
and
we
respectfully
urge
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
can’t
say
what
they
would
do.
i
would
say
what
i
think
they
should
do.
i
would
think
because
this
case
does
not
involve
those
considerations
which
justify
a
federal
court
abstaining
from
deciding
the
question
itself.
i
would
say
it
should
not
have
certified
in
this
case
because
in
my
judgment
this
court
has
indicated
that
a
federal
court
is
under
a
duty
which
is
placed
upon
it
by
congress
in
the
jurisdictional
act
to
decide
questions
of
state
law
except
in
those
very
narrow
circumstances
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
an
examination
of
the
nature
of
this
case
would
reveal
that
those
circumstances
are
not
present.
and
therefore,
i
would
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
come
to
that
conclusion
and
i
would
assume
your
honor
that
since
judge
kaufman
at
least
alluded
to
it
that
there
was
some
discussion
among
the
judges
and
this
may
well
have
been
a
consideration
which
influenced
the
court
to
decide
the
case
as
well
as
i
have
indicated
the
failure
of
the
petitioners
to
request
it.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
i
certainly
do
not,
your
honor.
i
think
the
fact
that
judge
kaufman
at
least
did
mention
it
would
suggest
that
the
court
did
give
consideration
to
it
and
decided
on
various
grounds
that
it
should
decide
the
case
and
not
certify.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
petitioner
has
acknowledged
this
morning
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
committed
reversible
error
in
this
action
which
is
based
upon
diversity
jurisdiction
in
deciding
the
question
of
florida
common
law,
rather
than
certifying
it
to
the
florida
supreme
court,
pursuant
to
florida’s
optional
certification
procedure.
this
court
denied
the
petitioners’
request
that
it
review
the
merits
of
this
decision
or
whether
the
court
below
violated
the
principles
of
erie
against
tompkins
in
reaching
its
decision.
petitioners,
i
suggest,
no
doubt
recognizing
the
weakness
of
their
position
on
the
question
which
is
before
this
court
had
nevertheless
argued
the
merits
of
this
decision
at
great
length
in
their
brief
and
also
this
morning.
since
the
merits
itself
of
the
decision
are
not
before
the
court,
i
shall
not
address
myself
to
them
this
morning,
but
i
would
say
only
in
passing
that
an
examination
of
the
decision
below,
i
think,
clearly
reveals
that
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
was
quite
mindful
of
its
obligations
under
erie
to
decide
this
case
under
florida
law
and
that
the
court’s
decision
is
well
supported
by
authorities,
including
florida
case
law
and
i
might
add
they
cited
a
decision
of
the
florida
supreme
court
in
support
of
their
decision.
petitioner
referred
to
four
cases
in
his
oral
argument
which
he
alleges
the
court
of
appeals
disregarded
or
overlooked.
i
might
say
only
in
commenting
upon
that
that
only
one
of
these
cases
was
even
cited
by
the
petitioners
to
the
court
of
appeals,
three
of
them
have
been
referred
to
in
their
brief
to
this
court,
but
were
not
even
included
in
their
brief
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
yes,
mr.
justice
brennan.
as
a
matter
of
fact
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
i
would
not
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
believed
that
the
question
was
settled.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
but
i
am
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
well,
i
think
there
is
a
threshold
question
if
i
may
answer
your
question
in
this
fashion.
i
think
the
basic
question
is,
is
this
an
appropriate
case
for
certification?
now
in
that,
judge
kaufman
in
his
dissent
did
make
a
passing
reference
to
the
possibility
of
certification.
i
would
assume
that
the
court
in
their
deliberations
probably
considered
the
whole
question
and
they
may
have
come
to
the
conclusion
and
i
believe
that
it
is
well
supported,
this
was
not
an
appropriate
case
for
certification.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
and
i
might
also
say,
since
i
think
you’ve
really
brought
this
point
up.
petitioner
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
florida
legislature
has
enacted
this
certification
statute
and
suggested
to
this
court
that
that
is
a
reason
for
having
a
federal
court
in
effect
to
abstain
through
certification
in
a
diversity
case.
first
of
all,
the
florida
statute
of
course
is
optional
in
the
sense
that
it
leaves
it
up
to
the
federal
court
to
decide
what
to
do.
but
i
think
the
more
important
answer
is,
that
the
florida
legislature
cannot
by
enacting
the
statute,
take
away
the
rights
which
are
given
to
litigants
under
the
diversity
of
jurisdiction
statute
to
go
into
a
federal
court
and
to
have
their
claims
adjudicated
there.
and
whether
they
have
that
right,
and
whether
the
court
erred
in
this
case,
i
think,
must
be
determined
under
federal
law
which
i
will
come
to.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
well,
your
honor,
i
cannot
of
course
search
into
the
minds
of
the
other
two
judges,
but
i
would
assume
from
the
fact
that
they
didn’t
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
yes,
that
is
true
your
honor.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
i
would
say
that
in
effect,
they
made
a
ruling
by
deciding
the
case.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
they
did
not
say
it
in
those
words
mr.
justice
marshall,
but
i
would
say
the
clear
inference
from
the
fact
that
they
did
go
ahead
and
decided
the
case
on
the
merits
that
they
determined
that
this
was
not
an
appropriate
case
for
certification.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
they
did
not
express
any
reasons,
that
is
correct.
the
basic
rule
turning
to
the
federal
law,
governing
the
obligation
of
federal
courts
to
decide
question
of
state
law
in
actions
based
upon
diversity
jurisdiction
was
of
course
set
forth
by
this
court
in
the
meredith
case,
which
is
generally
regarded
as
a
landmark
decision,
covering
the
obligation
of
federal
courts
to
decide
questions
of
state
law
in
diversity
cases.
this
court
said
and
i
will
quote
briefly,
“it
has
from
the
first
been
deemed
to
be
the
duty
of
the
federal
courts,
if
their
jurisdiction
is
properly
invoked,
to
decide
questions
of
state
law
whenever
necessary
to
the
rendition
of
judgment.”
this
court
then
went
on
to
say
that
in
the
absence
of
exceptional
circumstances,
a
failure
to
decide
such
questions
of
state
law,
and
again
i
quote,
“merely
because
the
answers
to
the
questions
of
state
law
are
difficult
or
have
not
yet
been
given
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state
would
thwart
the
purposes
of
the
jurisdictional
act.”
now,
the
principles
that
have
been
set
forth
by
meredith
have
been
reaffirmed
by
this
court
on
several
occasions.
in
propper
against
clark,
this
court
indicated
that
to
allow
the
difficulty
of
an
issue
of
a
state
law
to
deter
a
federal
court
from
deciding
the
issue
of
state
law
in
a
diversity
case
would
be
and
again
i
quote
“to
enervate
diversity
jurisdiction”.
again
in
mcneese
against
the
board
of
education,
this
court
noted
that
in
a
diversity
of
citizenship
case
and
i
quote
“we
hold
that
difficulties
and
perplexities
of
state
law
are
no
reason
for
referral
of
the
problem
to
the
state
court.”
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
well,
your
honor
i
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
no,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
no,
your
honor.
it
is
our
position
that
certification
is
a
form
of
abstention.
in
effect
by
certifying
the
question,
the
federal
court
abdicates
its
responsibility
to
decide
the
question
of
state
law
in
a
diversity
case
and
it
submits
the
issue
to
the
state
court.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
you
do
it
your
honor
in
a
case
we
submit
which
would
be
a
proper
case
for
abstention,
since
it
is
in
effect
a
form
of
abstention.
now,
it
may
be
preferable
to
outright
dismissal
as
a
form
of
abstention,
but
i
think
the
question
remains
whether
it
is
proper
for
the
federal
court
at
all
to
abstain
from
deciding
the
case
in
a
diversity
case
and
to
submit
the
issue
into
a
state
court.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
it
retains
jurisdiction
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
nevertheless,
is
abstention
in
the
sense
that
if
the
duty
of
the
federal
courts
under
the
jurisdictional
act
is
to
decide
all
questions
necessary
to
the
adjudication
of
a
judgment
in
a
diversity
case
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
i
think
there
is
no
incompatibility
your
honor
if
it’s
a
proper
case
for
a
federal
court
to
say
to
the
litigants,
we
will
not
decide
your
issue.
i
think,
if
we
have
to
choose
between
for
example,
outright
dismissal
and
certification,
there
is
no
question
that
the
certification
statute
may
serve
a
useful
purpose
and
of
course,
many
commentators
have
indicated
that
in
such
circumstances,
it
does
serve
a
useful
purpose.
but
i
would
respectfully
submit
to
this
court
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
in
effect
the
general
proposition
where
the
certification
may
serve
a
useful
function.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
there’s
no
question
about
that
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
there
is
no
case
directly
your
honor.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
i
think
that’s
true,
your
honor,
but
i
think
you
do
so
--
and
what
you
would
give
up
i
think
is
really
what
has
to
be
considered
[voice
overlap]
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
what
i
think,
what
you
give
up,
i
think
first
of
all
and
perhaps
it’s
more
than
just
giving
up
something.
i
think
it
does
represent
a
disregard
of
what
the
duty
is
on
the
federal
courts
under
the
diversity
of
citizenship
act.
i
believe
that
imposed
upon
the
federal
courts
by
congress
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
well,
first
of
all,
of
course
they
are
not
deciding
the
case
themselves.
now,
i
won’t
delay
to
this
point
but
i
have
--[voice
overlap]
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
that’s
correct.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
that’s
true
your
honor
and
i
think
this
court
has
considered
this
kind
of
situation
in
other
cases
if
i
might
for
example,
perhaps
in
responding
to
you
refer
to
what
this
court
said
in
the
propper
against
clark
case.
in
that
case,
i
think
this
court
clearly
indicated
that
a
federal
court
should
not
submit
questions
of
state
law
to
a
state
court
where
the
federal
courts
have
been
granted
jurisdiction
of
the
controversy
in
the
absence
of
special
circumstances
and
if
i
quote
briefly
from
it,
the
submission
of
special
issues
and
in
effect,
we
are
talking
here
about
a
special
issue,
is
a
useful
device
in
judicial
administration
in
sub-circumstances
as
existed
and
then
it
refers
to
magnolia,
spector,
fieldcrest,
and
pullman,
those
were
all
classic
abstention
cases.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
your
honor,
i
suppose
an
application
could
be
made
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
unlikely
event
and
i
recognize
that
there
are
instances
which
occur
where
federal
court
may
decide
a
case
and
then
subsequently,
a
state
court
may
decide
it
differently.
that
is
a
problem
that
is
involved
not
only
in
the
diversity
area,
it's
involved
in
every
case
where
you
have
conflicts
of
all
law
rule,
where
one
state
has
to
decide
what
another
state
would
do.
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
might
add
if
this
case
has
been
brought
for
example
in
the
state
courts
of
new
york
which
it
might
have.
the
new
york
state
courts
would
have
had
the
obligation
under
their
conflicts
of
law
rule
to
decide
what
florida
law
was
and
then
to
apply
it.
now,
of
course
there
is
always
the
danger
that
their
decision
could
be
wrong.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
well,
certainly
not
your
honor,
certainly
not.
that
is
a
problem
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
it
could
not
happen
if
the
question
was
certified,
but
your
honor
if
the
question
was
certified,
not
only
would
you
have
what
i
would
refer
to
is
ineffective
denial
of
the
rights
under
diversity
jurisdiction,
but
you
have
what
this
court
i
think
has
talked
about
time
and
time
again
the
desire
not
to
compel
litigants
to
go
down
as
i
--
if
i
may
borrow
the
phrase
for
mr.
justice
douglas,
“a
long
and
expensive
road
to
obtain
an
adjudication
in
the
case
that
they
have
brought.”
now,
the
delay
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
yes
mr.
justice
brennan,
clay
was
a
classic
abstention
case.
the
fifth
circuit
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
precisely,
precisely,
and
in
clay
your
honor.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
neither
aldrich
nor
dresner
were
even
diversity
cases.
that
in
both
of
those
case
you
had
a
problem
in
one
case
about
due
process
under
the
federal
constitution
which
could
be
avoided
and
in
the
other
case,
you
had
an
interpretation
of
the
full
faith
in
credit
cause.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
yes,
that
is
correct.
so
both
of
those
cases
really
don’t
support
the
proposition
in
this
case
because
they
involve
the
classic
type
of
abstention.
if
i
might
just
continue
my
answer
to
mr.
justice
marshall,
i
believe
that
one
of
the
real
problems
in
any
kind
of
abstention
including
certification
is
the
delay
and
the
extra
burdens,
the
added
expense.
now
certification
may
lessen
those
burdens,
but
it
certainly
doesn’t
eliminate
them.
it’s
been
reported
that
certification
to
the
state
of
florida
increases
the
length
of
a
case
maybe
by
at
least
a
year.
it
in
affect
produces
two
full
dress
appeals
where
one
had
taken
place
before
and
i
might
say
that
this
particular
case
is
really
a
inappropriate
case
to
permit
this
kind
of
certification
since
the
delay
involved
here
is
even
more
pronounced
because
of
the
fact
that
the
petitioners
here
did
not
even
request
certification.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
yes,
they
do
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
they
have
a
full
dress
appeal.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
that’s
correct,
that’s
correct.
in
this
case,
the
petitioners'
in
effect
allowed
the
parties
and
the
court
to
go
through
the
whole
appeal
before
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
they
allow
the
court
to
deliberate
to
reach
its
decision
and
then
finally,
ceasing
upon
really,
what
mr.
justice
--
justice
kaufman
had
added
in
his
opinion
because
his
main
part
of
his
opinion
is,
he
dissented
on
the
merits.
however,
he
added
at
the
end
that
perhaps
certification
should
have
been
used.
ceasing
upon
that,
the
petitioners
then
made
a
motion
for
rehearing
and
i
think
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
even
in
their
petition
for
rehearing,
they
did
not
come
out
in
a
forth
right
way
and
say,
this
case
should
be
certified.
they
asked
for
a
rehearing
en
banc
on
the
merits
in
effect,
asking
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
again
to
decide
the
case
on
the
merits
and
then
in
the
final
paragraph
of
the
12-page
petition
for
rehearing,
in
effect
what
they
said
is,
that
if
you
are
not
going
to
decide
in
our
favor,
then
please
send
the
case
down
to
the
state
of
florida.
i
might
say
perhaps
in
support
of
some
of
the
points
i
said
before
that
commentators
have
said
in
many
instances
and
i
refer
to
professor
wright
as
an
example
of
this,
that
certification
and
i
quote
is,
“an
undesirable
innovation”
if
it
will
lead
to
an
abrogation
of
the
merit
of
doctrine
and
similar
expressions
are
found
in
other
commentaries.
the
threshold
question
i
would
submit
to
this
court
is
whether
this
was
basically
a
case
for
abstention
of
any
kind
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
nature
of
the
case
and
the
instances
in
which
this
court
has
granted
abstention,
i
think
it’s
clear,
it’s
not.
there
is
no
constitutional
question
that
can
be
avoided
in
this
case.
there
is
no
constitutional
question
involved.
there
is
no
state
regulatory
scheme
involved
and
try
as
they
may,
the
petitioners
attempt
to
create
some
kind
of
regulatory
scheme
and
yet
the
issue
in
this
case,
essentially
involves
the
breach
of
a
fiduciary
duty
or
an
alleged
breach
of
a
fiduciary
duty.
i
suppose
if
certification
were
appropriate
or
abstention
were
appropriate.
in
this
case,
one
might
say,
then
in
virtually
any
case
where
one
alleges
a
breach
of
a
fiduciary
duty
if
there
is
an
unsettled
issue
of
law,
that
that’s
a
proper
case
for
certification.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
there
is
no
question
about
that
mr.
justice
marshall.
under
the
erie
case,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
recognized
that
and
it
did
its
duty,
i
would
submit
under
erie
as
required
by
congress
under
the
diversity
of
jurisdiction
act
to
decide
the
case
unless
there
was
special
circumstances
which
this
court
has
said
warranted
abstention.
now,
no
one
in
this
case
was
asking
a
federal
court
to
in
effect
enjoin
state
officials
from
carrying
out
their
act.
there
was
no
peculiar
local
issue
involved
here
such
as
eminent
domain
that
was
involved
with
thibodaux.
there
was
no
issue
here
as
there
was
in
the
kaiser
case
involving
the
control
of
vital
natural
resources.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
that’s
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
the
main
issue
in
this
case
is
not
even
the
propriety
of
the
petitioners’
conduct.
even
the
petitioners
have
conceded
here
that
the
act
that
was
committed
that
is
trading
with
inside
information
has
been
subject
to
universal
condemnation
so
that
we
are
not
even
talking
as
we
are
in
most
abstention
cases
with
whether
certain
conduct
within
a
state
is
proper
or
not.
what
we
are
talking
about
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
lum’s
should
have
a
remedy
to
recover
the
profits
which
were
made
by
these
defendants
as
a
result
of
their
alleged
trading
with
the
use
of
confidential
corporate
information.
we
would
submit
only
to
the
court
on
this
point
that
it
cannot
be
seriously
urged
that
it
is
the
public
policy
of
florida
that
a
person
should
be
permitted
to
engage
in
trading
with
confidential
corporate
information
in
the
stock
of
florida
corporations
and
that
the
decision
in
this
case
will
interfere
with
that
public
policy.
therefore,
we
would
submit
that
this
case
does
not
present
the
classic
conflicts
or
special
circumstances
which
would
have
warranted
abstention.
i
would
say
recognizing
really
that
this
is
not
a
proper
abstention
case,
the
main
thrust
of
the
petitioners’
argument
is
that
any
case
which
involves
an
unsettled
issue
of
law,
of
state
law
is
a
case
which
is
a
proper
case
for
certification
and
they
go
even
further.
they
say
if
the
court
does
not
certify
even
if
it
was
never
even
requested
to
do
so
that
it
has
a
committed
error.
i
think
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that,
and
if
i
may
borrow
a
phrase
from
mr.
justice
brennan,
there
is
a
very
narrow
corridor
through
which
a
federal
court
may
escape
from
its
obligation
to
decide
state
law
questions
when
federal
jurisdiction
is
properly
invoked.
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
to
accept
the
petitioners’
contention
that
where
there
is
an
unsettled
issue
of
state
law
and
i
might
say
parenthetically
in
a
majority
of
cases,
it
might
be
reasonably
contended
that
the
state
law
issue
is
not
settled,
that
this
would
be
to
open
the
door
wide
and
really
to
turn
this
narrow
corridor
which
the
court
has
very
carefully
limited
into
what
i
think
might
be
described
as
really
a
wide
canyon
and
i
think
these
are
the
clear
implications
of
the
petitioners’
argument.
there
is
no
support
that
the
petitioners
can
gain
as
i
have
indicated
from
either
the
clay
case
or
dresner
or
aldrich,
since
in
those
cases,
you
were
dealing
with
classic
abstention
cases
and
in
fact,
aldrich
and
dresner
were
not
even
diversity
cases.
in
clay,
i
think
it’s
also
appropriate
to
note
and
i
have
referred
to
this,
the
remarks
by
mr.
justice
douglas
where
he
gave
protest
to
the
practice
of
making
litigants
travel
a
long
and
expensive
road
in
order
to
obtain
justice.
and
i
think
in
this
case,
i
might
add
the
case
is
already
been
pending
three
years,
certification
will
now
require
the
parties
to
perhaps
spend
another
year
on
an
appellate
level
by
going
down
to
florida.
if
certification
is
appropriate
here,
it
may
well
be
appropriate
after
trial,
assuming
that
the
plaintiff
prevail
on
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
the
proof
in
this
case
may
be
different
than
the
allegations
of
the
complaint
and
the
issue
may
arise,
have
the
plaintiffs’
prove
the
case
under
florida
law
and
again,
the
argument
could
be
made
that
that
is
an
issue
that
should
be
certified
and
the
case
may
go
on
for
many
more
years
with
the
consequent
burdens
to
the
parties
as
a
result
of
that.
i
think
this
should
be
justified
only
--
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
i
suppose
your
honor
only
where
there’s
consent
judgments,
[attempt
to
laughter]
but
generally
not.
but
i
think
nevertheless
the
object
here
is
certainly
not
to
increase
the
time
or
expense
to
the
litigants.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
i
am
sorry.
i'm
mr.
ruby.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
they
are,
your
honor,
and
they
were
also
of
course
parties
to
the
action
brought
by
the
sec.
i
might
say,
in
that,
there
was
a
consent
judgment
by
the
mutual
fund
defendants,
they
consented
to
judgment
against
them.
lehman
brothers
went
to
trial
and
the
district
court
found
that
they
were
not
liable
on
the
limited
ground
that
they
were
not
responsible
for
their
agent
who
is
the
one,
who
in
effect
passed
on
the
information.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
it
was
your
honor.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
i
believe,
they
are
still
pending,
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
this
precise
data.
i
know
that
they
are
still
pending
and
being
litigated.
as
i
have
indicated
the
floor,
i
would
like
to
just
turn
for
a
moment
to
the
equities
of
this
case.
i
think
this
is
a
particularly
inappropriate
case
i
would
submit
to
the
court
to
find
that
the
court
below
erred
in
not
certifying
where
the
petition
is
never
even
requested
certification
before
the
adverse
decision
on
the
merits.
this
court
has
said
i
think
time
and
time
again
that
such
a
procedure
is
to
be
criticized
and
certainly
should
not
be
sanctioned
where
one
goes
into
court,
submits
his
rights
to
a
court,
gets
an
adverse
decision
and
then
wants
to
go
to
another
court
to
litigate
the
same
issues.
in
the
hostetter
case,
in
holding
that
it
was
not
error
in
not
abstaining.
this
court
referred
to
the
fact
that
neither
party
had
requested
it.
in
the
england
case
in
somewhat
different
circumstances,
this
court
indicated
that
where
a
party
like
the
petitioners
freely
litigates
his
claims
in
one
court
even
though
he
may
not
be
required
to
do
so,
he
should
not
be
allowed
to
ignore
the
adverse
decision
and
then
start
all
over
to
another
court.
that’s
precisely
what
the
petitioners
are
seeking
to
do
here
and
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
aptly
noted,
we
would
not
be
here
today
seeking
certification
if
the
petitioners
had
prevailed
in
the
court
of
appeals.
this
court
in
england
said
that
such
a
procedure,
the
kind
that
the
petitioners
are
seeking
to
follow
now
would
countenance
and
unnecessary
increase
in
the
length
and
cost
of
litigation
and
there
are
many
other
cases
along
those
lines.
those
cases
involving
disqualification
of
a
judge
or
court
indicate
that
a
litigant
cannot
experiment
with
the
court
to
see
what
happens.
so
this
is
precisely
what
the
petitioners
have
done
here.
they
were
quite
willing
to
let
the
court
of
appeals
decide
the
case,
but
then
when
it
was
decided
against
them,
after
they
so
to
speak
tested
the
water,
found
it
not
to
their
liking,
then
they
urged
that
the
court
should
not
have
decided
the
case
to
begin
with.
mr.
hagan
this
morning,
in
his
reply
brief,
i
think
made
a
remarkable
statement.
in
response
to
mr.
rehnquist's
question,
he
said
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
certification
until
after
the
decision
below
since
the
law
of
florida
was
not
debatable
or
uncertain.
i
might
say
in
passing
if
the
law
wasn’t
uncertain
then
you
wouldn’t
even
have
a
proper
case
for
certification.
but
the
implication
of
what
the
petitioners
are
saying
is,
that
you
do
not
even
determine
whether
certification
is
appropriate
by
considering
the
nature
of
the
case
or
the
issues
before
decision.
what
you
do
is
that,
after
the
decision,
you
look
at
the
decision
and
if
you
think
that
it
is
wrong,
then
you
argue
that
certification
should
have
taken
place.
i
would
suggest
respectfully
to
the
court
that
this
procedure
has
nothing
to
commend
it
and
then
certainly
should
not
be
sanctioned
by
this
court
in
this
case.
one
further
point
on
the
procedure,
the
petition
has
attempted
in
their
reply
brief
to
overcome
the
obvious
inequity
of
the
procedure
they
followed
by
making
reference
to
the
decision
in
the
kaiser
case
where
after
an
adverse
decision,
the
petitioner
made
a
motion,
asking
the
court
of
appeals
to
abstain
pending
a
determination
in
a
pending
declaratory
judgment
action
in
the
state.
the
tenth
circuit
denied
that
motion
with
judge
brown
who
was
sitting
by
designation
from
the
fifth
circuit
dissenting.
the
kaiser
case,
however,
this
court
then
of
course
went
on
to
reverse
and
ordered
abstention,
the
kaiser
case
however,
certainly
is
a
different
kind
of
case
and
doesn’t
sanction
the
kind
of
procedure
that
the
petitioners
have
followed
here.
kaiser
was
a
classic
abstention
case.
you
were
dealing
there
with
the
law
of
eminent
domain.
you
are
dealing
there
with
the
control
of
a
vital
natural
resource,
water
within
the
state
of
new
mexico.
even
the
attorney
general
of
new
mexico
had
to
come
in
and
asked
and
the
abstention
take
place.
where
you
have
this
classic
abstention
case
then
the
fact
that
the
litigant
did
not
ask
for
certification
perhaps
is
not
determinative
because
there
you
were
dealing
with
great
public
stakes
and
if
i
will
close
just
by
referring
with
judge
brown
said
in
his
dissent
in
the
tenth
circuit.
he
said,
if
we
were
not
dealing
with
serious
matters
of
great
public
moment
and
importance
to
new
mexico,
i
would
be
quite
willing
to
say
to
kaiser
that
it
must
live
with
the
consequences
of
a
federal
court
diversity
jurisdiction.
and
finally,
he
went
on
to
say,
similarly,
the
fact
that
the
motion
is
now
made
after
the
adverse
decision
of
this
court,
while
a
powerful
circumstance
in
many
situations
does
not
prevent
the
exercise
of
abstention
now
in
view
of
this
great
public
stakes
and
i
would
only
urge
this
court
that
here
where
we
are
not
dealing
with
those
great
public
stakes
of
considerations
that
are
present
in
abstention
that
the
failure
to
request
certification
before
an
adverse
decision
should
either
constitute
a
waiver
or
bar
to
argue
that
the
court
erred
in
not
doing
so
or
at
the
very
least
should
represent
in
judge
brown’s
word
a
powerful
circumstance
in
determining
whether
the
court
of
appeals,
assuming
it
had
any
discretion
to
certify,
abused
that
discretion.
we
submit
that
it
did
not
and
we
respectfully
urge
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
mr.
justice
blackmun,
i
can’t
say
what
they
would
do.
i
would
say
what
i
think
they
should
do.
i
would
think
because
this
case
does
not
involve
those
considerations
which
justify
a
federal
court
abstaining
from
deciding
the
question
itself.
i
would
say
it
should
not
have
certified
in
this
case
because
in
my
judgment
this
court
has
indicated
that
a
federal
court
is
under
a
duty
which
is
placed
upon
it
by
congress
in
the
jurisdictional
act
to
decide
questions
of
state
law
except
in
those
very
narrow
circumstances
and
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
an
examination
of
the
nature
of
this
case
would
reveal
that
those
circumstances
are
not
present.
and
therefore,
i
would
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
come
to
that
conclusion
and
i
would
assume
your
honor
that
since
judge
kaufman
at
least
alluded
to
it
that
there
was
some
discussion
among
the
judges
and
this
may
well
have
been
a
consideration
which
influenced
the
court
to
decide
the
case
as
well
as
i
have
indicated
the
failure
of
the
petitioners
to
request
it.
mr.
donald
n.
ruby
i
certainly
do
not,
your
honor.
i
think
the
fact
that
judge
kaufman
at
least
did
mention
it
would
suggest
that
the
court
did
give
consideration
to
it
and
decided
on
various
grounds
that
it
should
decide
the
case
and
not
certify.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
