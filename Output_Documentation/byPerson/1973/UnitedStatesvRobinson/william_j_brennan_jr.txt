justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
do
you
mean,
mr.
tuttle,
a
routine
traffic
check?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
was
the
reason
in
this
search?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
are
you
suggesting
as
i
drive
home,
an
officer
can
insist
that
i
pull
over
the
curb
while
he
asks
to
look
at
my
license?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
you
ever
experienced
this
since
you
live
in
washington?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
have
that
ever
happened
to
you?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
you’re
relying,
17
years.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
how
routine
is
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
thought
you
were
relying
on
the
fact
that
this
was
something
called
a
routine
traffic.
it's
part
of
your
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
whether
it
was
or
not,
i
gather
there's
no
challenge
to
the
arrest
here,
is
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
mean
the
right
to
search
for
weapons
but
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
how
about
a
sealed
envelope?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what’s
that
sealed
envelope,
that
--?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what’s
the
distinction
between
arrest
and
a
custodial
arrest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
do
you
think
preston
in
anyway
turned
on
the
fact
that
the
arrest
there
was
for
vagrancy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
recall
in
preston
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
you
remember,
we
held
invalid
an
automobile
search
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
and
that
search
while
not
at
the
scene
as
i
recall
it
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
i
could
be
wrong
about
that,
but
nevertheless
the
original
arrest
was
for
vagrancy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
just
wondered,
do
you
think
that
preston
in
anyway
rested
on
the
fact
that
the
arrest
there
was
for
vagrancy?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
--
i
need
make
this
argument
without
regard
to
what
the
offense
was
for
which
the
petitioner
was
arrested
--
responded
to.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
other
words,
it's
not
--
there's
no
significance
here
that
the
arrest
was
connected
only
with
an
alleged
traffic
offense?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know.
assuming
(voice
overlap).
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
assuming
that
were
--
you
mean,
it
does
--
the
scope
of
the
search,
assuming
a
valid
arrest
maybe
one
thing
if
the
arrest
is
for
a
minor
traffic
offense
and
something
else
if
its
for
an
armed
robbery?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
the
case
of
the
armed
robbery?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
let’s
see,
in
dealing
with
our
case,
this
robinson
case,
your
submission
is
that
a
search
with
an
evidentiary
purpose
could
not
be
permissible
in
the
circumstance?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now
--
does
that
go
as
far
to
suggest
that
it
was
wrong
even
to
go
into
robinson’s
pocket
for
the
crumpled
up
cigarette
package
or
is
it
wrong
only
to
open
the
package?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
may
i
ask
this
mr.
gartlan,
this
is
not
your
case.
you
take
the
previous
case.
suppose
what
mr.
robinson
had
in
his
pocket
was
the
stiff
box
of
cigarettes
rather
than
the
crumpled
package.
in
that
circumstance,
would
--
the
officer
would
have
been
testified
in
going
into
his
pocket?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
your
answer
to
me
then
is
it
wouldn’t
make
any
difference
to
your
case?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
it
had
been
the
box
rather
than
(voice

justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
gartlan,
i
am
clear
that
you
do
concede
the
validity
of
the
arrest?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
--
yes,
well,
i
thought
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
that
same
problem
don’t
you,
is
it
chimel
--
[laughter]
justice
william
j.
brennan,

what
we
were
told
here
one
day,
it
was
chimel
by
by
someone
who
said
he
knew
chimel.[laughter]
