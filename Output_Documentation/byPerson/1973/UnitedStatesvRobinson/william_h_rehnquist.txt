mr.

wouldn’t
the

put
to
you
by

stewart

put
to

in
the
proceeding
here
by

that
is
that
where
you
have
a
valid

you
may
have
a
full

search
without
further
inquiry,
solve
a
lot
of
the
kind
of
parsing
of

and
at

offer
a
certain
simplicity
of
administration
(voice

justice

and
what

do
you
need

valid

well
it’s
the

if

that
would
be

take

in

there
was

justice
william

well
one

justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
gartlan,
the
constitution
doesn’t
require
miranda
warnings,
how
do
you
explain
the
miranda
decision?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
robinson
case
involves
the
validity
of
a
search
of
the
person
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest,
where
after
the
arrest,
the
police
officer
makes
a
decision
to
take
the
person
arrested
into
custody.
here,
a
police
officer
in
the
district
of
columbia
arrested
respondent
robinson
for
the
crime
of
operating
a
motor
vehicle
after
revocation
of
his
operator's
permit,
in
offense
defined
by
statute
in
the
district.
in
accordance
with
police
practice
and
regulations,
the
officer
then
proceeded
to
search
robinson
face-to-face,
and
then
the
officer
proceeded
to
conduct
a
patdown.
during
the
course
of
the
patdown,
the
officer
felt
an
object
in
the
left
breast
pocket
of
a
heavy
outer
coat
which
robinson
wore.
the
officer
testified
that
he
couldn't
tell
what
it
was
and
couldn't
actually
tell
the
size
of
it.
he
then
reached
into
the
pocket
and
pulled
out
the
object
which
turned
out
upon
extraction
to
be
a
crumpled
up
cigarette
package.
the
officer
testified
that
he
could
feel
objects
in
the
package,
but
couldn't
tell
what
they
were,
although
he
knew
they
were
not
cigarettes.
he
then
open
the
package
and
found
gelatin
capsules
which
turned
out
upon
further
examination
to
be
heroin.
robinson
was
convicted
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
possession
and
concealment
of
the
heroin.
in
the
appeal,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
this
circuit,
claiming
that
the
heroin
should
have
been
excluded
from
evidence
at
his
trial,
because
it
was
the
product
of
an
unlawful
search.
the
court
of
appeals
heard
the
case
en
banc
and
the
majority
decided
that
the
search
of
robinson
by
the
officer
had
been
unlawful
and
that
therefore,
his
conviction
must
be
reversed,
and
we
granted
certiorari.
it
is
well
settled
that
the
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
is
a
historical
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment.
we
hold
here
that
we
are
following
such
a
lawful
arrest,
the
determination
is
made
to
take
the
person
arrested
into
custody.
a
search
of
his
person
is
not
only
an
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment
but
it
is
a
reasonable
intrusion
under
fourth
amendment
standards
and
requires
no
additional
justification.
this
being
the
case,
it
is
immaterial
whether
or
not
they
were
potential
fruits
of
the
crime
for
which
robinson
was
originally
arrested,
what
the
probability
in
this
particular
situation
was
that
weapons
would,
in
fact,
be
found
upon
his
person
or
that
the
arresting
officer
in
this
particular
case
did
not
fear
robinson
or
believe
that
he
was
armed.
the
search
of
robinson's
person
having
been
lawful,
fruits
are
contraband
such
as
the
heroin
capsules
could
be
seized
upon
being
discovered
in
the
course
of
the
lawful
search.
for
these
reasons,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
justice
powell
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court
has
filed
a

concurring
opinion.
