we’ll
hear
arguments
next
in
72-936,
united
states
against
robinson.
mr.
tuttle,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief

warren
e.
burger
do
--
you
said
routine,
you
mean
routine
or
random?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
you
find
a
razor,
suppose
you
find
in
that
cartoon
a
razor
with
a
small
holder
so
that
it
could
be
used
as
a
weapon
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
would
it
suggest
to
the
officer
as
i
think
mr.
justice
white
brought
out
in
the
prior
case
that
if
the
man
had
an
a
razor
in
a
holder
that
could
be
used
as
a
weapon,
he
might
have
some
other
weapons
on
him
that
would
justify
a
more
extensive
search.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well
didn’t
the
time
factor
enter
into
it
also
that
they
didn’t
search
the
car
in
preston
until
either
several
hours
or
some
substantial
time
after
the
original
arrest?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so,
it
wasn’t
incidental
to
the
original
arrest
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
gartlan.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
while
you
--
are
you
reading
the
terry
case
type
of
search
as
a
limitation
defining
the
outer
boundaries
of
the
kind
of
a
search
which
can
be
made
after
a
lawful
arrest?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
if
they
teach
all
of
policemen
to
do
that,
what’s
the
real
difference
then
mr.
gartlan
between
whether
it’s
a
standing
order
or
a
standing
practice?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you're
not
questioning
that
a
search
is
permitted
incidental
to
a
lawful
arrest,
are
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
are
--
well,
do
you
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
regard
that
as
an
exception
to
some
rule.
is
that
the
way
you
frame
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it’s
a
warrant
--
it’s
a
warrantless
arrest
to
be
sure,
but
it's
--
no
question
about
its
standing
and
it's
being
recognized,
is
there?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
if
the
arrest
had
been
made
here
mr.
gartlan
explicitly
for
driving
while
under
the
influence
of
some
intoxicating
substance,
wouldn’t
all
of
your
arguments
be
the
same?
what
do
you
--
what
effect
do
you
think
that
it
have
on
your
case,
i'll
put
it
that
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
or
heroin,
on
marijuana,
the
same?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
here,
the
evidence
--
there
were
some
indication
that
there
was
no
odor
of
liquor
and
therefore
the
officer
was
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes.
so
that
--
does
that
arise
or
--
i
might
be
confusing
that
with
preceding
case?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.

do
you
have
--
just
two
minutes
left.
