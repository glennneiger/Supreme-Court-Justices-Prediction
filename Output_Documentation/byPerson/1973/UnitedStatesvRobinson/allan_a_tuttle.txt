mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
as
the
court
is
aware,
presents
questions
quite
similar
to
those
raised
in
gustafson
versus
state
of
florida
which
you’ve
just
heard.
there
are
also
differences,
which
i
have
to
point
out
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
but
basically,
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
scope
of
a
permissible
search
for
weapons,
incident
to
a
lawful
custodial
arrest.
and
the
arrest
here
occurred
in
april
of
1968,
when
officer
richard
jenks
of
the
metropolitan
police
department
here
in
the
district,
arrested
the
respondent
robinson
for
the
crime
of
driving
after
revocation
of
his
operator's
permit
and
for
obtaining
a
permit
by
misrepresentation.
in
the
course
of
a
search
of
robinson
incident
to
that
arrest,
officer
jenks
discovered
heroin
and
that
heroin
became
the
basis
of
a
prosecution
for
unlawful
possession
of
heroin.
he
was
convicted
of
that
offense
in
august
of
1969
and
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
procedural
history
here
is
a
little
involved.
the
court
of
appeals,
a
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
respondent’s
conviction
on
the
ground
that
the
seizure
had
been
illegal.
however,
the
case
was
then
heard
en
banc
by
the
entire
panel
--
court
of
appeals
and
they
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
an
evidentiary
hearing,
on
the
scope
of
the
search
incident
to
the
april
23rd
arrest.
then
after
the
evidentiary
hearing,
the
en
banc
court
again
heard
the
case
and
this
time,
by
a
vote
of
five
to
four
held
that
officer
jenks’
search
had
exceeded
the
scope
of
a
permissible
weapon
search
incident
to
this
arrest.
now,
the
facts
of
the
search
can
be
briefly
summarized.
the
arrest
here
occurred
on
april
23rd
of
1968.
few
days
prior
to
that
time,
officer
jenks
had
stopped
the
respondent
robinson
in
a
routine
traffic
check.
he
noticed
the
discrepancy
between
the
birth
dates
on
the
respondent’s
temporary
operator’s
permit
and
the
birth
date
on
his
draft
card.
and
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
mean
a
stop
where
the
officer
will
bring
a
car
to
the
curb
that
he
observes
for
any
reason
that
leads
him
to
wish
to
check
whether
or
not
the
driver
is
duly
licensed
and
the
car’s
property
register.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
the
record
does
not
reveal
any
particular
reason
on
this
case.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
absolutely,
yes.
i
do
believe
that
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
i
mean
--
i
mean
it
was
routine
and
that
is
--
it
is
a
practice
of
the
metropolitan
police
department
to
do
this
and
--
this
kind
of
stop
on
a
random
basis.
it
is
random,
but
it’s
also
routine
and
that
it’s
not
unusual.
that’s
what
i
meant.
i
may
say
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
such
a
stop?
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
have
been
stopped
but
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
in
that
particular
circumstance,
no,
i
haven’t.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
i
may
say
that
this
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
this
is
not
a
question
before
the
court
unless
the
court
wishes
to
make
it
a
question.
the
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i’m
relying
in
the
last
analysis
on
the
fact
that
this
is
a
conceitedly
lawful
arrest.
now,
i
did
--
perhaps
your
honor
is
confused
between
the
dates
and
i
was
trying
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
date
of
april
19th
when
this
stop
occurred
and
the
license
check
was
made
because
no
arrest
was
made
at
that
time.
and
it
was
only
later
after
the
officer
had
checked
those
dates
which
where
he
saw
the
discrepancy
through
the
traffic
records
and
discovered
by
checking
those
dates
that
robinson’s
regular
operators
permit
had
been
previously
revoked.
but
going
back
to
the
original
stop,
that
was
never
questioned
throughout
this
trial.
there
was
a
question
in
the
initial
trial
of
this
case
when
robinson’s
had
a
different
trial
counsel
where
he
suggested
that
perhaps
the
scope
of
the
routine
traffic
check
was
excessive.
that
it
was
permissible
and
under
the
mincey
case
in
the
district,
it
has
been
held
permissible
to
make
these
stops.
but
he
suggested
that
having
received
the
temporary
operator’s
permit,
he
had
no
right
to
look
at
the
draft
card.
now
that
argument
did
not
prevail
in
the
district
court
and
has
not
been
advanced
since
that
time.
and
i
think
for
the
purposes
of
this
court,
we
have
to
assume
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
as
has
every
court
which
has
considered
the
matter
that
this
routine
traffic
check
was
permissible
and
lawful.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
there
is
no
challenge
to
the
arrest
here
in
this
court.
i
want
to
come
to
a
question
which
is
brooded
in
the
brief
a
little
bit
about
the
question
of
whether
this
second
arrest
might
have
been
a
pretext
for
a
narcotics
search.
and
with
the
court’s
permission,
i’ll
come
to
that
in
the
course
of
my
exposition.
after
he
had
determined
that
there
had
been
revocation
of
robinson’s
regular
operator's
permit.
the
next
day
after
he
made
that
determination
in
the
traffic
records,
officer
jenks
saw
robinson
again
driving
not
far
from
here,
on
8th
and
c
streets,
north
east
and
pulled
the
respondent
over
for
--
in
order
to
arrest
him
for
the
crime
of
driving
after
revocation
of
his
temporary
operator's
permit.
now
the
respondent
got
out
of
the
car
and
walked
toward
the
police
officer.
the
police
officer
then
asked
robinson
for
his
operator's
permit,
the
temporary
operator's
permit,
which
he’d
previously
seen
and
upon
receiving
it
informed
robinson
that
he
was
under
arrest
for
driving
after
revocation
of
his
regular
operator's
permit
and
for
obtaining
his
temporary
permit
by
misrepresentation.
now
at
that
point,
as
required
by
the
standing
orders
of
the
metropolitan
police
department,
he
proceeded
to
search
robinson.
in
this
case,
they
were
standing
face
to
face
outside
the
automobiles.
and
officer
jenks
placed
his
hands
on
the
respondent’s
chest.
his
left
hand
--
his
right
hand
on
the
respondent’s
left
breast
and
almost
immediately,
he
felt
an
object
inside
the
pocket
of
the
car
coat
that
robinson
was
wearing.
he
felt
an
object
in
the
left
breast
pocket.
now
the
record
shows
that
officer
jenks
didn’t
know
what
that
object
was,
he
couldn’t
tell
its
size
or
he
couldn’t
tell
whether
it
was
hard
or
whether
it
was
soft.
officer
jenks
then
reached
into
the
pocket
and
pulled
the
package
out.
the
package
was
a
crumpled
up
package
of
cigarettes.
officer
jenks
at
that
point,
the
record
shows
knew
that
the
package
did
not
contain
cigarettes
because
of
its
crumpled
condition
and
he
didn’t
know
what
it
did
contain.
he
opened
it
up
and
he
found
the
heroin,
which
is
the
subject
of
this
prosecution.
now,
in
light
of
some
of
the
questions
asked
in
the
previous
argument,
i
think
i
should
state
that
the
record
indicates
that
officer
jenks
was
not
in
any
imminent
sense
of
danger
to
not
feel
in
any
imminent
sense
of
danger.
he
had
a
substantial
weight
advantage
over
the
respondent
and
wasn’t
in
any
particular
fear
in
conducting
this
arrest.
nor
did
he
have
any
specific
purpose
in
mind
when
he
conducted
the
arrest.
what
he
said
was
when
asked
i
just
searched
him,
i
didn’t
think
about
what
i
was
looking
for,
i
just
searched
him.
he
did
say
that
he
recognized
that
the
rules
which
required
the
search
were
designed
for
his
own
safety
and
were
designed
to
uncover
any
weapons
which
might
have
been
used
to
harm
him.
now,
if
i
may
mention
one
or
two
preliminary
matters.
first
of
all,
unlike
gustafson,
the
government
here
does
not
advance
any
evidentiary
basis
for
this
search.
we
predicate
the
search
entirely
on
the
right
to
search
for
weapons.
we
believe
that
he
had
all
the
evidence
he
needed
when
he
had
the
temporary
operator's
permit.
now,
going
to
an
argument
i
mentioned
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
oh,
of
course,
i’m
a
--
the
arrest
was
conceded
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
lawful
when
they
remanded
it.
they
didn’t
remand
it
to
determine
the
lawfulness
of
the
arrest.
they
remanded
it
because
the
original
record
didn’t
show
enough
facts
about
the
scope
of
the
search.
now,
the
search
here
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
or
the
arrest
here
was
not
a
pretext
for
a
narcotic
search
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
it--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
it’s
conceivable
to
me
that
there
might
be
a
search
which
would
exceed
the
scope
of
a
permissible
search
for
weapons.
if
i
see
a
folded
piece
or
a
--
not
a
folded,
but
a
piece
of
paper
in
a
person’s
pocket
which
might
be
a
written
confession
of
a
crime,
if
i
were
conducting
an
evidentiary
search,
i
might
want
to
look
at
it.
if
i
were
conducting
a
weapon
search
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
we
--
i’d
have
to
develop
the
hypothetical
a
little
bit
if
it
were
solid
or
had
any
kind
of
solidity
to
it
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
it
might
contain
a
razor
blade
or
some
such
thing
then
i
would
say
it’d
be
a
permissible
weapon
search.
but
as
i
say,
it
is
conceivable
and
that’s
why
i
say
that
i
don’t
go
quite
as
far
as
you
suggest
mr.
justice
because
it’s
conceivable
that
an
evidentiary
search
might
in
certain
circumstances
be
of
a
broader
scope
than
a
permissible
weapon
search.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well
that
--
of
course
we’re
not
because
that
would
raise
the
rochin
kind
of
problem
and
that
would
be
beyond
the
scope
of
a
permissible
weapon
search.
our
basic
position
is
that
it’s
not
only
where
there
is
an
arrest
that
we
feel
that
a
complete
search
for
weapons
is
permissible
but
it
is
where
there
is
a
custodial
arrest.
it’s
important
to
realize
that
in
this
case,
we’re
not
dealing
with
a
minor
traffic
offense.
the
crime
of
driving
after
revocation
of
your
operator's
permit
is
a
statutory
offense
defined
by
congress.
it
carries
a
minimum
of
30
days
in
jail
and
a
maximum
of
a
year.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
i
would
as
--
i
would
not
want
to
argue
that
when
a
police
officer
stops
a
car
to
issue
a
summons
that
that
was
not
an
arrest.
there
is
after
all
a
restriction
on
the
person’s
movement.
and
yet
we
concede
and
it
is
the
practice
here
in
the
district
where
there
is
an
issuance
of
a
summons
not
to
conduct
the
full
custody
--
field
search
is
required
in
the
case
of
custodial
arrest.
that’s
why
i
want
to
make
the
distinction
that
the
regulations
of
the
police
department
require
that
this
individual
be
taken
into
custody,
require
that
he’d
be
taken
down
to
the
station
house
for
booking
and
also
the
regulations
of
the
police
department
require
that
whenever
such
an
arrest
is
made,
a
so-called
full
custody
arrest
that
a
full
field
search
be
made
of
the
individual
for
anything
that
he
might
have
on
him,
be
it
evidence
or
be
it
weapons.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
excuse
me?
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
he
did
--
could
he
or
did
he?
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
he
could
but
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
officer
--
the
court
is
probably
aware
that
last
month,
officer
pamraning
(ph)
in
the
police
force
in
arlington
was
shot
and
killed
by
a
man
that
he
handcuffed.
i
think
that
handcuffing
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
it
has
to
do
mr.
justice
with
the
point
i
believe
that
handcuffing
is
not
an
adequate
protection
for
police
officers
conducting
custodial
arrests
and
i
just
cite
that
as
a
single
recent
example.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that’s
correct.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
he
could
not
use
that
particular
weapon,
but
i
believe
that
the
search
of
that
container
which
could’ve
contained
the
weapon
was
wholly
justified
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
every
search
which
is
conducted
by
any
officer
is
different
and
everything
an
officer
sees
tells
him
something
about
how
far
he
has
to
go
to
be
safe
in
conducting
the
search.
and
i
think
an
examination
of
a
closed
container
on
a
person
is
part
of
the
--
helps
the
officer
to
know
by
looking
at
it
whether
or
not
he’s
dealing
with
a
dangerous
person.
if
there's
nothing
dangerous
in
that
container,
he
would
return
it
presumably.
if
there
is,
he
may
feel
the
need
to
go
further.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
it
might
if
the
officer
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
anything
that
could
contain
a
weapon,
subject
or
possibly
--
that
could
possibly
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
subject
the
officer
to
injury.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
--
if
it
were
folded,
possibly.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
the
--
there
are
number
of
reasons
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
it’s
all
safe.
nothing
happens
to
it
presumably
if
it’s
an
innocent
object,
a
key
case
with
nothing
but
keys
then
it
would
be
returned
to
you.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
absolutely
not.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
(voice
overlap)
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
would
certain
--
which
could
certainly
be
introduced
an
evidence
against
the
person
for
carrying
concealed
weapon.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
was
the
point
mr.
justice
i
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
was
trying
to
make
by
suggesting
that
the
search
of
these
containers
gives
the
officer
information
about
the
kind
of
possible
dangers
he
maybe
facing.
i
also
think
that
the
suggestion
that
mr.
justice
marshall
made
would
create
substantial
custodial
problems
with
the
police.
in
order
to
be
safe,
they
would
have
to
remove
anything
that
was
a
closed
container
from
the
person
arrested
and
somehow
try
and
handle
that
while
they
were
handling
the
individual
subject
to
arrest.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
we
--
we
do
think
that
such
a
rule
of
course
would
be
understandable
and
manageable
by
a
police
officers
attempting
to
deal
with
situations
on
the
street.
and
that
a
rule
which
required
an
officer
in
every
instance
to
determine
that
a
search
has
an
evidentiary
purpose
or
has
a
weapon’s
purses
--
purposes
perhaps
going
to
con
--
be
confusing
for
police
officers.
in
fact
the
record
supports
your
point
mr.
justice.
there
was
testimony
from
an
officer
donaldson,
a
police
instructor,
who
testified
that
time
is
of
the
essence
in
conducting
a
custodial
arrest.
and
that
if
an
officer
had
to
stop
and
think;
now
i’m
searching
for
this,
now
i’m
searching
for
that
then
he
wouldn’t
be
able
to
react
in
a
manner
that
would
enable
him
to
conduct
the
safe
and
speedy
arrest.
it’s
also
true
that
if
we
do
adopt
the
kind
of
distinctions
that
the
respondent
is
urging
here,
we
are
going
to
be
faced
with
a
whole
new
set
of
problems
in
litigation.
we’ll
be
litigating
in
every
instance
whether
a
particular
kind
of
crime
is
one
that’s
likely
to
produce
evidence.
and
even
where
it’s
conceded
that
the
crime
has
evidence,
i
believe
one
of
the
justices
mentioned
the
possibility
of
an
arrest
for
stealing
a
television
or
some
such
thing,
they’ll
be
--
we’ll
be
litigating
whether
or
not
evidence
of
a
particular
size
and
consistency
was
likely
to
have
resulted
from
a
given
kind
of
crime.
and
i
think
that
to
require
officers
to
try
and
make
these
judgments
every
time
they
impose
a
custodial
arrest
in
a
street
situation
would
be
an
unmanageable
problem
and
would
also
as
i’ve
indicated
create
a
whole
new
set
of
litigation
problems
for
this
court.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
no,
it
did
not.
we
have
never
make
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
that’s
--
that
is
our
basic
argument.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
but
we
do
concede
that
searches
could
be
excessive.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
and
searches
are
justified
--
in
our
view,
searches
are
justified
by
the
reason
which
gives
rise
to
the
right
to
make
the
search
and
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
if
it
is,
as
in
this
case,
a
search
for
weapons
then
the
reasonable
possibility
of
finding
weapons
would
indicate
the
--
would
indicate
the
reasonable
extent
of
the
search.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
i
recognize
mr.
justice
white
that
there
are
two
possible
--
there's
more
than
one
ground
upon
which
the
court
could
sustain
the
search
here.
if
the
court
is
prepared
to
hold
that
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
suggested
that
a
valid
arrest
ends
the
inquiry
then
there
would
not
be
--
then
we
would
solve
certain
problems
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
it
has
been
the
law
since
the
weeks
case.
that’s
was
far
back
as
i
was
able
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
this
is
the
first
case
that
i
know
of
where
a
challenge
has
been
made
and
made
successfully
in
the
court
below
that
there
ought
to
be
limitations
on
the
scope
of
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
absolutely
and
i
would
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
decision
in
the
worthy
case,
which
was
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
which
the
chief
justice
sat
on
the
panel
where
the
court
below,
a
panel
of
the
court
below
rejected
an
attempt
to
impose
limitations
on
a
search
incident
to
a
vagrancy
arrest
there.
and
i
think
it's
very
significant
that
the
dissent
in
that
case
was
written
by
judge
wright
who
wrote
the
majority
opinion
below
and
in
the
descent
in
1969,
judge
wright
was
prepared
to
say
that
there
was
no
law
supporting
his
view
that
a
search
for
an
arrest
for
vagrancy
was
impermissible.
in
1972,
he
has
the
majority
of
the
court
with
him,
but
it's
unquestionably
true
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
this
is
a
new
idea.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
the
question
where?
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
it
was
back
at
the
police
station.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
and
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
reason
to
think
that
evidence
will
be
found
in
the
car
that
would
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
think
it
did.
the
--
but
there
the
question
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
there
it
was
a
question
of
an
evidentiary
search
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
it
wouldn’t
be
found.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
but
under
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
under
chambers
v.
maroney,
if
we
were
to
take
the
case
forward
to
today,
the
court
--
this
question
where
the
court
would
come
out
the
same
way.
but
if
they
did
come
out
the
same
way
as
they
did
in
preston,
it
would
be
because
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
that
evidence
of
vagrancy
would
be
found
in
a
search
of
an
automobile.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
yes,
and
which
made
it
not
incident
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
no.
but
i’m
saying
that
perhaps
that
that
analysis
of
preston
is
affected
by
the
court’s
decision
in
chambers
which
would
have
a
lot
of
search
a
few
hours
later
at
a
different
place
where
there's
a
valid
reason
for
search.
whereas
in
preston,
since
it
was
a
vagrancy
arrest,
there
was
no
valid
reason
for
search.
i’d
like
to
make
one
final
point
about
mr.
--
relating
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
suggestion
about
keeping
the
object
away
from
the
person
and
that
is
that
this
court
has
never
made
such
a
suggestion
before
and
indeed
as
i
think
held
the
opposite
in
one
case
that
comes
to
mind.
your
honors,
if
we
recall,
we’ve
been
discussing
this
morning
the
peters
case.
well,
in
peters,
officer
lasky
was
conducting
a
weapon
search
and
he
patted
peters
down
and
he
felt
an
object
which
under
terry,
he
had
the
right
to
remove,
namely
a
hard
object
which
could’ve
been
a
weapon.
he
removed
it
but
what
is
significant
for
the
purposes
of
our
present
argument
is
that
what
he
found
was
a
closed
opaque
plastic
envelope.
and
of
course,
he
then
opened
it
and
discovered
not
a
weapon
but
a
burglary
tools.
and
at
that
time,
no
one
questioned
that
having
taken
that
object
away
from
peters,
officer
lasky
should
simply
have
held
it
at
a
distance.
it
was
considered
reasonable
for
him
to
look
at
that
time.
i
suggest
the
same
analysis
apply
here.
that
it
was
reasonable
for
the
officer
to
look
inside
this
package
once
he
had
it
out
of
--
in
his
hands
and
out
of
the
reach
of
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
yes
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
(voice
overlap)
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
was
in
it?
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
it
--
perhaps
could’ve
been.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
your
honor,
we
attempted
to
develop
a
record
on
the
question
of
what
kinds
of
things
might
be
found
in
a
small
container
in
the
hearing
on
remand
and
officer
or
rather
clandestine
weapons
expert
mr.
newhouser
(ph)
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
he
had
approximately
25
weapons
that
were
puffed
--
had
the
possibility
of
subjecting
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
he
did
not
have
a
letter
bomb
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
he
could
have
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
didn’t
have
such
an
item
on
him.
he
testified
that
many
of
these
weapons
were
small
enough
to
fit
inside
a
cigarette
package
and
in
fact,
one
of
them
i
think
was
carrying
it
in
the
cigarette
package.
and
i
think
it’s
significant
that
he
testified
that
only
a
really
thorough
going
search
which
would’ve
included
going
under
his
belt,
going
in
the
waistline
and
it
turning
out
in
examining
all
pockets.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
whatever
it
be,
the
weapons.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i’ve
suggested
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i’ve
suggested
several
considerations.
one
is
to
assure
himself
that
there
was
nothing
like
the
weapon
inside
it.
i’ve
suggested
that
if
he
couldn’t
do
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
yes
he
would
have
and
if
he
couldn’t,
he’d
be
subjected
to
all
kinds
of
difficulties
of
a
custodial
obligations
attaching
to
it
and
i’ve
suggested
that
in
the
peters
case,
the
court
has
suggested
that
that
is
a
perfectly
permissible
practice.
now,
i’d
like
to
point
out
one
fact
that
is
argue
--
an
argument
which
is
made
by
the
respondent’s
counsel.
well,
he
argues
that
this
expert’s
evidence
shows
really
the
opposite
of
what
we
argued
that
it
shows.
he
argues
that
it
shows
that
a
pat
down
is
adequate
and
i
suggest
that
the
confusion
there
arises
from
a
confusion
as
to
what
a
frisk
really
is.
and
a
search
of
the
record
indicates
that
in
this
case,
mr.
gartlan
quoted
some
language
from
terry
to
the
police
officer,
excuse
me,
the
weapons
expert
which
involved
a
thorough
search
of
the
body
and
the
groin
and
the
testicles
and
it
goes
on
to
describe
that
search.
now
the
expert
there
testified
that
that
was
not
a
frisk
and
was
not
in
his
view
of
a
frisk
and
i
attempted
to
demonstrate
in
the
brief
that
that
language
was
never
intended
to
be
a
definition
of
a
frisk.
and
i
think
that
if
the
court
reads
the
record
with
that
in
mind
and
with
the
fact
in
mind
that
the
expert
did
testify
that
it
would
be
required
in
order
to
conduct
a
really
thorough
search
that
the
officer
go
into
the
pockets.
that
it’s
quite
clear
from
the
record
that
a
terry
type
frisk
would
be
inadequate
to
reveal
all
the
weapons
that
could
be
hidden.
now,
there
is
a
second
point
that
we
raise
in
the
brief
relating
to
the
question
that
if
the
court
finds
that
reaching
into
pocket
did
infringe
robinson’s
fourth
amendment
rights,
it
would've
been
a
minimal
violation
at
most.
and
we
suggest
that
the
deterrent
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
would
not
be
well
served
by
excluding
evidence
which
is
the
result
of
a
policeman’s
protective
search.
but
i
don’t
believe
that
i
have
to
go
into
that
at
this
point
because
i
believe
first
of
all,
my
time
is
about
to
expire
and
secondly,
i
believe
that
this
search
was
thoroughly
reasonable
and
that
the
conviction
ought
to
be
sustained
on
that
ground.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
would
ask
you
to
modify
it,
yes.
because
it
--
we
don’t
have
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
we
--
if
the
court
reached
that
point,
it
would
not
be
that
that
we
will
be
asking
for
the
total
abolition
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
but
for
a
consideration
of
the
extent
of
deviation
from
normal
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
and
there's
no
question
that
every
case
including
up
to
--
i
think
a
recent
example
is
davis,
indicates
that
the
court
has
never
adopted
such
a
rule,
that’s
quite
true.
thank
you.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i’ll
try
and
cover
a
few
very
brief
points.
the
first
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
comments
on
chimel
or
the
chimel
case,
i
believe
that
that
opinion
itself
made
it
very
clear
that
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
wish
(voice
overlap).
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
knew
the
individual?
[laughter]
i
--
that
case
itself
makes
clear
that
a
search
of
the
person
is
permissible
and
then
there's
language
to
that
effect
also
in
mr.
justice
white’s
dissent.
secondly
on
the
comment
that
mr.
donaldson
was
a
sanguine
individual
about
searches.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
page
101
of
the
appendix
when
he
is
asked
what
kind
--
whether
a
terry
search
is
adequate
in
a
terry
situation,
and
he
says,
“my
opinion
would
be
that
before
i
would
put
anyone
beside
me
in
a
cruiser,
i’d
like
to
be
able
to
search
him
completely
but
we
can't.”
i
don’t
--
i
think
--
i
don’t
think
he
even
feels
safe
in
the
terry
situation
according
to
that
record.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
it
contemplates
with
ticketing
to
do
that
mr.
justice.
when
you're
issuing
a
speeding
ticket,
you
have
the
individual
sit
in
the
cruiser
next
to
you.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
no,
no.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
and
that’s
what
he
was
referring
to.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
now,
there
is
also
the
point
about
the
concession
that
a
search
of
a
cigarette
package
would
be
permissible
in
the
case
of
an
armed
robbery.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
decision
in
schmerber
and
also
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
in
6057.
both
of
which
articulate
the
basis
of
an
evidentiary
search
as
being
that
which
is
found
in
plain
view
during
a
weapon
search.
in
other
words,
that
a
weapon
--
that
the
justification
for
searching
at
all
maybe
a
search
for
weapons
and
i
find
it
strange
that
there
is
a
concession
that
you
can
do
anything
you
want
to
an
individual
whether
some
conceivable
notion
that
there
might
be
a
weapon,
but
that
you're
terribly
restricted
when
the
idea
is
protecting
yourself
from
possible
dangers
of
weapons.
thank
you.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
as
the
court
is
aware,
presents
questions
quite
similar
to
those
raised
in
gustafson
versus
state
of
florida
which
you’ve
just
heard.
there
are
also
differences,
which
i
have
to
point
out
in
the
course
of
my
argument.
but
basically,
we
are
concerned
here
with
the
scope
of
a
permissible
search
for
weapons,
incident
to
a
lawful
custodial
arrest.
and
the
arrest
here
occurred
in
april
of
1968,
when
officer
richard
jenks
of
the
metropolitan
police
department
here
in
the
district,
arrested
the
respondent
robinson
for
the
crime
of
driving
after
revocation
of
his
operator's
permit
and
for
obtaining
a
permit
by
misrepresentation.
in
the
course
of
a
search
of
robinson
incident
to
that
arrest,
officer
jenks
discovered
heroin
and
that
heroin
became
the
basis
of
a
prosecution
for
unlawful
possession
of
heroin.
he
was
convicted
of
that
offense
in
august
of
1969
and
an
appeal
was
taken
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
procedural
history
here
is
a
little
involved.
the
court
of
appeals,
a
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
respondent’s
conviction
on
the
ground
that
the
seizure
had
been
illegal.
however,
the
case
was
then
heard
en
banc
by
the
entire
panel
--
court
of
appeals
and
they
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
an
evidentiary
hearing,
on
the
scope
of
the
search
incident
to
the
april
23rd
arrest.
then
after
the
evidentiary
hearing,
the
en
banc
court
again
heard
the
case
and
this
time,
by
a
vote
of
five
to
four
held
that
officer
jenks’
search
had
exceeded
the
scope
of
a
permissible
weapon
search
incident
to
this
arrest.
now,
the
facts
of
the
search
can
be
briefly
summarized.
the
arrest
here
occurred
on
april
23rd
of
1968.
few
days
prior
to
that
time,
officer
jenks
had
stopped
the
respondent
robinson
in
a
routine
traffic
check.
he
noticed
the
discrepancy
between
the
birth
dates
on
the
respondent’s
temporary
operator’s
permit
and
the
birth
date
on
his
draft
card.
and
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
mean
a
stop
where
the
officer
will
bring
a
car
to
the
curb
that
he
observes
for
any
reason
that
leads
him
to
wish
to
check
whether
or
not
the
driver
is
duly
licensed
and
the
car’s
property
register.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
the
record
does
not
reveal
any
particular
reason
on
this
case.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
absolutely,
yes.
i
do
believe
that
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
i
mean
--
i
mean
it
was
routine
and
that
is
--
it
is
a
practice
of
the
metropolitan
police
department
to
do
this
and
--
this
kind
of
stop
on
a
random
basis.
it
is
random,
but
it’s
also
routine
and
that
it’s
not
unusual.
that’s
what
i
meant.
i
may
say
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
such
a
stop?
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
have
been
stopped
but
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
in
that
particular
circumstance,
no,
i
haven’t.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
i
may
say
that
this
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
this
is
not
a
question
before
the
court
unless
the
court
wishes
to
make
it
a
question.
the
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i’m
relying
in
the
last
analysis
on
the
fact
that
this
is
a
conceitedly
lawful
arrest.
now,
i
did
--
perhaps
your
honor
is
confused
between
the
dates
and
i
was
trying
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
date
of
april
19th
when
this
stop
occurred
and
the
license
check
was
made
because
no
arrest
was
made
at
that
time.
and
it
was
only
later
after
the
officer
had
checked
those
dates
which
where
he
saw
the
discrepancy
through
the
traffic
records
and
discovered
by
checking
those
dates
that
robinson’s
regular
operators
permit
had
been
previously
revoked.
but
going
back
to
the
original
stop,
that
was
never
questioned
throughout
this
trial.
there
was
a
question
in
the
initial
trial
of
this
case
when
robinson’s
had
a
different
trial
counsel
where
he
suggested
that
perhaps
the
scope
of
the
routine
traffic
check
was
excessive.
that
it
was
permissible
and
under
the
mincey
case
in
the
district,
it
has
been
held
permissible
to
make
these
stops.
but
he
suggested
that
having
received
the
temporary
operator’s
permit,
he
had
no
right
to
look
at
the
draft
card.
now
that
argument
did
not
prevail
in
the
district
court
and
has
not
been
advanced
since
that
time.
and
i
think
for
the
purposes
of
this
court,
we
have
to
assume
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
and
as
has
every
court
which
has
considered
the
matter
that
this
routine
traffic
check
was
permissible
and
lawful.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
there
is
no
challenge
to
the
arrest
here
in
this
court.
i
want
to
come
to
a
question
which
is
brooded
in
the
brief
a
little
bit
about
the
question
of
whether
this
second
arrest
might
have
been
a
pretext
for
a
narcotics
search.
and
with
the
court’s
permission,
i’ll
come
to
that
in
the
course
of
my
exposition.
after
he
had
determined
that
there
had
been
revocation
of
robinson’s
regular
operator's
permit.
the
next
day
after
he
made
that
determination
in
the
traffic
records,
officer
jenks
saw
robinson
again
driving
not
far
from
here,
on
8th
and
c
streets,
north
east
and
pulled
the
respondent
over
for
--
in
order
to
arrest
him
for
the
crime
of
driving
after
revocation
of
his
temporary
operator's
permit.
now
the
respondent
got
out
of
the
car
and
walked
toward
the
police
officer.
the
police
officer
then
asked
robinson
for
his
operator's
permit,
the
temporary
operator's
permit,
which
he’d
previously
seen
and
upon
receiving
it
informed
robinson
that
he
was
under
arrest
for
driving
after
revocation
of
his
regular
operator's
permit
and
for
obtaining
his
temporary
permit
by
misrepresentation.
now
at
that
point,
as
required
by
the
standing
orders
of
the
metropolitan
police
department,
he
proceeded
to
search
robinson.
in
this
case,
they
were
standing
face
to
face
outside
the
automobiles.
and
officer
jenks
placed
his
hands
on
the
respondent’s
chest.
his
left
hand
--
his
right
hand
on
the
respondent’s
left
breast
and
almost
immediately,
he
felt
an
object
inside
the
pocket
of
the
car
coat
that
robinson
was
wearing.
he
felt
an
object
in
the
left
breast
pocket.
now
the
record
shows
that
officer
jenks
didn’t
know
what
that
object
was,
he
couldn’t
tell
its
size
or
he
couldn’t
tell
whether
it
was
hard
or
whether
it
was
soft.
officer
jenks
then
reached
into
the
pocket
and
pulled
the
package
out.
the
package
was
a
crumpled
up
package
of
cigarettes.
officer
jenks
at
that
point,
the
record
shows
knew
that
the
package
did
not
contain
cigarettes
because
of
its
crumpled
condition
and
he
didn’t
know
what
it
did
contain.
he
opened
it
up
and
he
found
the
heroin,
which
is
the
subject
of
this
prosecution.
now,
in
light
of
some
of
the
questions
asked
in
the
previous
argument,
i
think
i
should
state
that
the
record
indicates
that
officer
jenks
was
not
in
any
imminent
sense
of
danger
to
not
feel
in
any
imminent
sense
of
danger.
he
had
a
substantial
weight
advantage
over
the
respondent
and
wasn’t
in
any
particular
fear
in
conducting
this
arrest.
nor
did
he
have
any
specific
purpose
in
mind
when
he
conducted
the
arrest.
what
he
said
was
when
asked
i
just
searched
him,
i
didn’t
think
about
what
i
was
looking
for,
i
just
searched
him.
he
did
say
that
he
recognized
that
the
rules
which
required
the
search
were
designed
for
his
own
safety
and
were
designed
to
uncover
any
weapons
which
might
have
been
used
to
harm
him.
now,
if
i
may
mention
one
or
two
preliminary
matters.
first
of
all,
unlike
gustafson,
the
government
here
does
not
advance
any
evidentiary
basis
for
this
search.
we
predicate
the
search
entirely
on
the
right
to
search
for
weapons.
we
believe
that
he
had
all
the
evidence
he
needed
when
he
had
the
temporary
operator's
permit.
now,
going
to
an
argument
i
mentioned
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
oh,
of
course,
i’m
a
--
the
arrest
was
conceded
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
be
lawful
when
they
remanded
it.
they
didn’t
remand
it
to
determine
the
lawfulness
of
the
arrest.
they
remanded
it
because
the
original
record
didn’t
show
enough
facts
about
the
scope
of
the
search.
now,
the
search
here
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
or
the
arrest
here
was
not
a
pretext
for
a
narcotic
search
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
it--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
it’s
conceivable
to
me
that
there
might
be
a
search
which
would
exceed
the
scope
of
a
permissible
search
for
weapons.
if
i
see
a
folded
piece
or
a
--
not
a
folded,
but
a
piece
of
paper
in
a
person’s
pocket
which
might
be
a
written
confession
of
a
crime,
if
i
were
conducting
an
evidentiary
search,
i
might
want
to
look
at
it.
if
i
were
conducting
a
weapon
search
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
we
--
i’d
have
to
develop
the
hypothetical
a
little
bit
if
it
were
solid
or
had
any
kind
of
solidity
to
it
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
it
might
contain
a
razor
blade
or
some
such
thing
then
i
would
say
it’d
be
a
permissible
weapon
search.
but
as
i
say,
it
is
conceivable
and
that’s
why
i
say
that
i
don’t
go
quite
as
far
as
you
suggest
mr.
justice
because
it’s
conceivable
that
an
evidentiary
search
might
in
certain
circumstances
be
of
a
broader
scope
than
a
permissible
weapon
search.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well
that
--
of
course
we’re
not
because
that
would
raise
the
rochin
kind
of
problem
and
that
would
be
beyond
the
scope
of
a
permissible
weapon
search.
our
basic
position
is
that
it’s
not
only
where
there
is
an
arrest
that
we
feel
that
a
complete
search
for
weapons
is
permissible
but
it
is
where
there
is
a
custodial
arrest.
it’s
important
to
realize
that
in
this
case,
we’re
not
dealing
with
a
minor
traffic
offense.
the
crime
of
driving
after
revocation
of
your
operator's
permit
is
a
statutory
offense
defined
by
congress.
it
carries
a
minimum
of
30
days
in
jail
and
a
maximum
of
a
year.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
i
would
as
--
i
would
not
want
to
argue
that
when
a
police
officer
stops
a
car
to
issue
a
summons
that
that
was
not
an
arrest.
there
is
after
all
a
restriction
on
the
person’s
movement.
and
yet
we
concede
and
it
is
the
practice
here
in
the
district
where
there
is
an
issuance
of
a
summons
not
to
conduct
the
full
custody
--
field
search
is
required
in
the
case
of
custodial
arrest.
that’s
why
i
want
to
make
the
distinction
that
the
regulations
of
the
police
department
require
that
this
individual
be
taken
into
custody,
require
that
he’d
be
taken
down
to
the
station
house
for
booking
and
also
the
regulations
of
the
police
department
require
that
whenever
such
an
arrest
is
made,
a
so-called
full
custody
arrest
that
a
full
field
search
be
made
of
the
individual
for
anything
that
he
might
have
on
him,
be
it
evidence
or
be
it
weapons.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
excuse
me?
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
he
did
--
could
he
or
did
he?
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
he
could
but
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
officer
--
the
court
is
probably
aware
that
last
month,
officer
pamraning
(ph)
in
the
police
force
in
arlington
was
shot
and
killed
by
a
man
that
he
handcuffed.
i
think
that
handcuffing
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
it
has
to
do
mr.
justice
with
the
point
i
believe
that
handcuffing
is
not
an
adequate
protection
for
police
officers
conducting
custodial
arrests
and
i
just
cite
that
as
a
single
recent
example.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that’s
correct.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
he
could
not
use
that
particular
weapon,
but
i
believe
that
the
search
of
that
container
which
could’ve
contained
the
weapon
was
wholly
justified
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
every
search
which
is
conducted
by
any
officer
is
different
and
everything
an
officer
sees
tells
him
something
about
how
far
he
has
to
go
to
be
safe
in
conducting
the
search.
and
i
think
an
examination
of
a
closed
container
on
a
person
is
part
of
the
--
helps
the
officer
to
know
by
looking
at
it
whether
or
not
he’s
dealing
with
a
dangerous
person.
if
there's
nothing
dangerous
in
that
container,
he
would
return
it
presumably.
if
there
is,
he
may
feel
the
need
to
go
further.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
it
might
if
the
officer
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
anything
that
could
contain
a
weapon,
subject
or
possibly
--
that
could
possibly
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
subject
the
officer
to
injury.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
--
if
it
were
folded,
possibly.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
the
--
there
are
number
of
reasons
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
it’s
all
safe.
nothing
happens
to
it
presumably
if
it’s
an
innocent
object,
a
key
case
with
nothing
but
keys
then
it
would
be
returned
to
you.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
absolutely
not.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
(voice
overlap)
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
would
certain
--
which
could
certainly
be
introduced
an
evidence
against
the
person
for
carrying
concealed
weapon.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
was
the
point
mr.
justice
i
--
mr.
chief
justice,
i
was
trying
to
make
by
suggesting
that
the
search
of
these
containers
gives
the
officer
information
about
the
kind
of
possible
dangers
he
maybe
facing.
i
also
think
that
the
suggestion
that
mr.
justice
marshall
made
would
create
substantial
custodial
problems
with
the
police.
in
order
to
be
safe,
they
would
have
to
remove
anything
that
was
a
closed
container
from
the
person
arrested
and
somehow
try
and
handle
that
while
they
were
handling
the
individual
subject
to
arrest.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
we
--
we
do
think
that
such
a
rule
of
course
would
be
understandable
and
manageable
by
a
police
officers
attempting
to
deal
with
situations
on
the
street.
and
that
a
rule
which
required
an
officer
in
every
instance
to
determine
that
a
search
has
an
evidentiary
purpose
or
has
a
weapon’s
purses
--
purposes
perhaps
going
to
con
--
be
confusing
for
police
officers.
in
fact
the
record
supports
your
point
mr.
justice.
there
was
testimony
from
an
officer
donaldson,
a
police
instructor,
who
testified
that
time
is
of
the
essence
in
conducting
a
custodial
arrest.
and
that
if
an
officer
had
to
stop
and
think;
now
i’m
searching
for
this,
now
i’m
searching
for
that
then
he
wouldn’t
be
able
to
react
in
a
manner
that
would
enable
him
to
conduct
the
safe
and
speedy
arrest.
it’s
also
true
that
if
we
do
adopt
the
kind
of
distinctions
that
the
respondent
is
urging
here,
we
are
going
to
be
faced
with
a
whole
new
set
of
problems
in
litigation.
we’ll
be
litigating
in
every
instance
whether
a
particular
kind
of
crime
is
one
that’s
likely
to
produce
evidence.
and
even
where
it’s
conceded
that
the
crime
has
evidence,
i
believe
one
of
the
justices
mentioned
the
possibility
of
an
arrest
for
stealing
a
television
or
some
such
thing,
they’ll
be
--
we’ll
be
litigating
whether
or
not
evidence
of
a
particular
size
and
consistency
was
likely
to
have
resulted
from
a
given
kind
of
crime.
and
i
think
that
to
require
officers
to
try
and
make
these
judgments
every
time
they
impose
a
custodial
arrest
in
a
street
situation
would
be
an
unmanageable
problem
and
would
also
as
i’ve
indicated
create
a
whole
new
set
of
litigation
problems
for
this
court.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
no,
it
did
not.
we
have
never
make
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
that’s
--
that
is
our
basic
argument.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
but
we
do
concede
that
searches
could
be
excessive.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
and
searches
are
justified
--
in
our
view,
searches
are
justified
by
the
reason
which
gives
rise
to
the
right
to
make
the
search
and
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
if
it
is,
as
in
this
case,
a
search
for
weapons
then
the
reasonable
possibility
of
finding
weapons
would
indicate
the
--
would
indicate
the
reasonable
extent
of
the
search.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
i
recognize
mr.
justice
white
that
there
are
two
possible
--
there's
more
than
one
ground
upon
which
the
court
could
sustain
the
search
here.
if
the
court
is
prepared
to
hold
that
as
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
suggested
that
a
valid
arrest
ends
the
inquiry
then
there
would
not
be
--
then
we
would
solve
certain
problems
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
it
has
been
the
law
since
the
weeks
case.
that’s
was
far
back
as
i
was
able
to
(voice
overlap).
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
this
is
the
first
case
that
i
know
of
where
a
challenge
has
been
made
and
made
successfully
in
the
court
below
that
there
ought
to
be
limitations
on
the
scope
of
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
absolutely
and
i
would
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
decision
in
the
worthy
case,
which
was
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
which
the
chief
justice
sat
on
the
panel
where
the
court
below,
a
panel
of
the
court
below
rejected
an
attempt
to
impose
limitations
on
a
search
incident
to
a
vagrancy
arrest
there.
and
i
think
it's
very
significant
that
the
dissent
in
that
case
was
written
by
judge
wright
who
wrote
the
majority
opinion
below
and
in
the
descent
in
1969,
judge
wright
was
prepared
to
say
that
there
was
no
law
supporting
his
view
that
a
search
for
an
arrest
for
vagrancy
was
impermissible.
in
1972,
he
has
the
majority
of
the
court
with
him,
but
it's
unquestionably
true
mr.
justice
rehnquist
that
this
is
a
new
idea.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
the
question
where?
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
yes.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
it
was
back
at
the
police
station.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
and
the
court
held
that
there
was
no
reason
to
think
that
evidence
will
be
found
in
the
car
that
would
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
think
it
did.
the
--
but
there
the
question
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
there
it
was
a
question
of
an
evidentiary
search
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
it
wouldn’t
be
found.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well,
but
under
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
under
chambers
v.
maroney,
if
we
were
to
take
the
case
forward
to
today,
the
court
--
this
question
where
the
court
would
come
out
the
same
way.
but
if
they
did
come
out
the
same
way
as
they
did
in
preston,
it
would
be
because
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
that
evidence
of
vagrancy
would
be
found
in
a
search
of
an
automobile.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
yes,
and
which
made
it
not
incident
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
no.
but
i’m
saying
that
perhaps
that
that
analysis
of
preston
is
affected
by
the
court’s
decision
in
chambers
which
would
have
a
lot
of
search
a
few
hours
later
at
a
different
place
where
there's
a
valid
reason
for
search.
whereas
in
preston,
since
it
was
a
vagrancy
arrest,
there
was
no
valid
reason
for
search.
i’d
like
to
make
one
final
point
about
mr.
--
relating
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
suggestion
about
keeping
the
object
away
from
the
person
and
that
is
that
this
court
has
never
made
such
a
suggestion
before
and
indeed
as
i
think
held
the
opposite
in
one
case
that
comes
to
mind.
your
honors,
if
we
recall,
we’ve
been
discussing
this
morning
the
peters
case.
well,
in
peters,
officer
lasky
was
conducting
a
weapon
search
and
he
patted
peters
down
and
he
felt
an
object
which
under
terry,
he
had
the
right
to
remove,
namely
a
hard
object
which
could’ve
been
a
weapon.
he
removed
it
but
what
is
significant
for
the
purposes
of
our
present
argument
is
that
what
he
found
was
a
closed
opaque
plastic
envelope.
and
of
course,
he
then
opened
it
and
discovered
not
a
weapon
but
a
burglary
tools.
and
at
that
time,
no
one
questioned
that
having
taken
that
object
away
from
peters,
officer
lasky
should
simply
have
held
it
at
a
distance.
it
was
considered
reasonable
for
him
to
look
at
that
time.
i
suggest
the
same
analysis
apply
here.
that
it
was
reasonable
for
the
officer
to
look
inside
this
package
once
he
had
it
out
of
--
in
his
hands
and
out
of
the
reach
of
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
well
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
yes
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
(voice
overlap)
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
that
was
in
it?
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
it
--
perhaps
could’ve
been.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
your
honor,
we
attempted
to
develop
a
record
on
the
question
of
what
kinds
of
things
might
be
found
in
a
small
container
in
the
hearing
on
remand
and
officer
or
rather
clandestine
weapons
expert
mr.
newhouser
(ph)
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
he
had
approximately
25
weapons
that
were
puffed
--
had
the
possibility
of
subjecting
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
he
did
not
have
a
letter
bomb
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
he
could
have
but
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
didn’t
have
such
an
item
on
him.
he
testified
that
many
of
these
weapons
were
small
enough
to
fit
inside
a
cigarette
package
and
in
fact,
one
of
them
i
think
was
carrying
it
in
the
cigarette
package.
and
i
think
it’s
significant
that
he
testified
that
only
a
really
thorough
going
search
which
would’ve
included
going
under
his
belt,
going
in
the
waistline
and
it
turning
out
in
examining
all
pockets.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
whatever
it
be,
the
weapons.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i’ve
suggested
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i’ve
suggested
several
considerations.
one
is
to
assure
himself
that
there
was
nothing
like
the
weapon
inside
it.
i’ve
suggested
that
if
he
couldn’t
do
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
yes
he
would
have
and
if
he
couldn’t,
he’d
be
subjected
to
all
kinds
of
difficulties
of
a
custodial
obligations
attaching
to
it
and
i’ve
suggested
that
in
the
peters
case,
the
court
has
suggested
that
that
is
a
perfectly
permissible
practice.
now,
i’d
like
to
point
out
one
fact
that
is
argue
--
an
argument
which
is
made
by
the
respondent’s
counsel.
well,
he
argues
that
this
expert’s
evidence
shows
really
the
opposite
of
what
we
argued
that
it
shows.
he
argues
that
it
shows
that
a
pat
down
is
adequate
and
i
suggest
that
the
confusion
there
arises
from
a
confusion
as
to
what
a
frisk
really
is.
and
a
search
of
the
record
indicates
that
in
this
case,
mr.
gartlan
quoted
some
language
from
terry
to
the
police
officer,
excuse
me,
the
weapons
expert
which
involved
a
thorough
search
of
the
body
and
the
groin
and
the
testicles
and
it
goes
on
to
describe
that
search.
now
the
expert
there
testified
that
that
was
not
a
frisk
and
was
not
in
his
view
of
a
frisk
and
i
attempted
to
demonstrate
in
the
brief
that
that
language
was
never
intended
to
be
a
definition
of
a
frisk.
and
i
think
that
if
the
court
reads
the
record
with
that
in
mind
and
with
the
fact
in
mind
that
the
expert
did
testify
that
it
would
be
required
in
order
to
conduct
a
really
thorough
search
that
the
officer
go
into
the
pockets.
that
it’s
quite
clear
from
the
record
that
a
terry
type
frisk
would
be
inadequate
to
reveal
all
the
weapons
that
could
be
hidden.
now,
there
is
a
second
point
that
we
raise
in
the
brief
relating
to
the
question
that
if
the
court
finds
that
reaching
into
pocket
did
infringe
robinson’s
fourth
amendment
rights,
it
would've
been
a
minimal
violation
at
most.
and
we
suggest
that
the
deterrent
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
would
not
be
well
served
by
excluding
evidence
which
is
the
result
of
a
policeman’s
protective
search.
but
i
don’t
believe
that
i
have
to
go
into
that
at
this
point
because
i
believe
first
of
all,
my
time
is
about
to
expire
and
secondly,
i
believe
that
this
search
was
thoroughly
reasonable
and
that
the
conviction
ought
to
be
sustained
on
that
ground.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
would
ask
you
to
modify
it,
yes.
because
it
--
we
don’t
have
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
we
--
if
the
court
reached
that
point,
it
would
not
be
that
that
we
will
be
asking
for
the
total
abolition
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
but
for
a
consideration
of
the
extent
of
deviation
from
normal
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
and
there's
no
question
that
every
case
including
up
to
--
i
think
a
recent
example
is
davis,
indicates
that
the
court
has
never
adopted
such
a
rule,
that’s
quite
true.
thank
you.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i’ll
try
and
cover
a
few
very
brief
points.
the
first
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
stewart’s
comments
on
chimel
or
the
chimel
case,
i
believe
that
that
opinion
itself
made
it
very
clear
that
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest
--
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
i
wish
(voice
overlap).
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
knew
the
individual?
[laughter]
i
--
that
case
itself
makes
clear
that
a
search
of
the
person
is
permissible
and
then
there's
language
to
that
effect
also
in
mr.
justice
white’s
dissent.
secondly
on
the
comment
that
mr.
donaldson
was
a
sanguine
individual
about
searches.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
page
101
of
the
appendix
when
he
is
asked
what
kind
--
whether
a
terry
search
is
adequate
in
a
terry
situation,
and
he
says,
“my
opinion
would
be
that
before
i
would
put
anyone
beside
me
in
a
cruiser,
i’d
like
to
be
able
to
search
him
completely
but
we
can't.”
i
don’t
--
i
think
--
i
don’t
think
he
even
feels
safe
in
the
terry
situation
according
to
that
record.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
it
contemplates
with
ticketing
to
do
that
mr.
justice.
when
you're
issuing
a
speeding
ticket,
you
have
the
individual
sit
in
the
cruiser
next
to
you.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
no,
no.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
and
that’s
what
he
was
referring
to.
mr.
allan
a.
tuttle
now,
there
is
also
the
point
about
the
concession
that
a
search
of
a
cigarette
package
would
be
permissible
in
the
case
of
an
armed
robbery.
i
would
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
decision
in
schmerber
and
also
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
new
york
in
6057.
both
of
which
articulate
the
basis
of
an
evidentiary
search
as
being
that
which
is
found
in
plain
view
during
a
weapon
search.
in
other
words,
that
a
weapon
--
that
the
justification
for
searching
at
all
maybe
a
search
for
weapons
and
i
find
it
strange
that
there
is
a
concession
that
you
can
do
anything
you
want
to
an
individual
whether
some
conceivable
notion
that
there
might
be
a
weapon,
but
that
you're
terribly
restricted
when
the
idea
is
protecting
yourself
from
possible
dangers
of
weapons.
thank
you.
