mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
understand
the
government’s
position
in
this
case,
it
basically
takes
three
themes.
first
of
all,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
terry
case,
the
sibron
case
or
the
peters
case
which
limits
the
scope
of
a
post
to
rest
search.
and
that
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
confused
two
distinct
sets
of
principles
applicable
to
fourth
amendment
searches
by
disregarding
the
significance
of
a
lawful
arrest.
the
second
theme
of
the
government’s
argument
is
that
the
metropolitan
police
departments
of
the
district
of
columbia,
instruction
to
its
police
officers
with
respect
to
the
extent
of
a
search
in
this
case,
this
type
of
case
is
a
reasonable
type
of
instruction
and
approach
that
a
terry
type
frisk
is
not
adequate
protection
in
the
instance
of
a
full
custody
arrest.
and
finally,
the
attack
upon
the
exclusionary
rule
and
the
request
that
it'd
be
modified
in
cases
of
this
type.
it
seems
to
us
clear
addressing
myself
to
the
first
point
that
in
terry,
this
court
rejected
a
notion
advanced
by
the
state
of
ohio
that
the
fourth
amendment
doesn’t
even
come
into
play
as
a
limitation
upon
police
conduct
if
the
officer
stopped
short
of
something
called
a
technical
arrest
or
a
full
blown
search.
and
this
court
went
further
to
say
that
the
sounder
course
of
analysis
in
fourth
amendment
cases
is
to
recognize
that
the
fourth
amendment
governs
all
intrusions
by
agents
of
the
public
upon
personal
security
and
to
make
the
scope
of
a
particular
intrusion
in
the
light
of
all
of
the
exigencies
of
the
case
a
central
element
in
the
analysis
of
reasonable
arrest.
then
in
peters
we
had
a
case
wherefore
the
purposes
of
constitution
analysis,
an
arrest
had
taken
place
when
officer
lasky
apprehended
peters
in
the
hallway
of
his
apartment.
and
this
court
said
with
respect
to
the
pat
down
type
of
search
that
was
conducted
by
officer
lasky
that
this
was
reasonably
limited
in
its
scope
to
its
evidentiary
and
protective
purposes
and
was
not
an
unrestrained
and
thorough
going
examination
of
the
arrestee
and
his
personal
effects.
now
the
government
has
pointed
out
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
harlan’s
observation
of
that
language
in
the
terry
decision.
mr.
justice
harlan
said,
“that’s
all
it
was,
an
observation”
and
that
the
court
was
--
and
in
other
words,
the
court
was
not
saying
in
terry
that
a
protective
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
is
limited
to
a
frisk.
but
this
court
in
chimel
shortly
after
terry
said
as
to
its
decision
in
peters
and
i
quote,
“we
sustain
the
search
in
peters,
however,
only
because
its
scope
had
been
reasonably
limited
by
the
need
to
seize
weapons
and
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
evidence.”
we
emphasized,
again
quoting
from
this
court’s
decision
that
the
arresting
officer
did
not
engage
in
an
unrestrained
and
through
going
examination
of
peters
and
his
personal
effects.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
in
--
certainly
in
peters,
this
case
was
--
this
court
was
taking
the
scope
limitation
principles
applied
truly
enough
in
a
different
context
in
terry
and
making
an
application
of
them
in
a
new
context,
a
post
arrest
situation.
and
in
sibron,
the
third
case
in
the
trilogy,
while
there,
the
court
found
that
--
this
court
found
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
and
that
the
circumstances
were
there
for
the
equivalent
of
the
stop
and
frisk
situation
confronting
the
officer
in
terry.
in
its
opinion,
it
assumed
arguendo
that
would
--
even
though
if
the
circumstances
of
apprehension
and
fear
had
been
present
in
the
sibron
case
as
they
had
been
in
terry,
thus
making
it
for
the
purposes
of
protection
of
a
police
officer
the
equivalent
of
a
post
arrest
situation,
then
the
search
into
sibron’s
pockets
was
going
too
far.

mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
i
am
reading
it
as
an
articulation
of
principles
mr.
chief
justice
that
apply
to
all
intrusions
and
since
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
is
an
intrusion,
yes
and
i
think
that
the
language
in
terry
is
rather
explicit
in
that
regard.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
the
court
found
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
that’s
correct
but
they
did
--
this
court
did
take
pains
to
know
that
officer
lasky's
search
in
terry,
even
though
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
i’m
sorry,
in
peters.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
was
not
thorough
going
and
unrestrained
and
was
limited
to
the
purposes
for
which
it
could
be
made
which
justified
it
in
its
inception.
this
court
said
in
terry
--
this
court
has
held
in
the
past
and
that
is
why
i
think
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
this
circuit
was
not
in
aberration.
this
court
has
held
in
the
past
that
a
search
which
is
reasonable
at
its
inception
may
violate
the
fourth
amendment
by
virtue
of
its
intolerable
intensity
and
scope,
citing
authorities.
the
scope
of
the
search
must
be,
“strictly
tied
to
and
justified
by
the
circumstances
which
rendered
its
initiation
permissible
quoting
authorities
that
go
all
the
way
back
to
the
agnello
case.”
this
--
the
decision
of
our
court
of
appeals
was
not
in
aberration
if
terry
was
not
an
aberration
because
what
terry
was,
was
an
articulation
of
scope
limitation
principles
applicable
to
these
kinds
of
intrusions
and
our
case
presented
the
first
opportunity
to
apply
those
limitation
principles
to
a
post
custody
arrest
explicit
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
was
done
implicitly
in
the
terry,
sibron,
peters
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
yes.
i
think
there
are
scope
limitation
principles
even
where
a
search
is
justified
by
an
evidentiary
purpose.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
yes
there
is.
in
our
case
in
terms
of
a
reasonableness
of
the
arrest
by
all
means
because
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
the
reasonableness
of
the
search.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
yes
sir.
yes
mr.
justice
brennan
and
for
this
reason.
an
arrest
for
an
armed
robbery
clearly
would
justify
an
evidentiary
search
of
the
persons
for
the
fruits
or
the
instruments
or
the
instrumentalities
or
evidence
of
that
crime.
and
to
the
extent
that
those
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
found
upon
the
person
of
the
arrestee
given
the
circumstances
at
the
time
and
execution
of
the
arrest,
certainly,
he
could
be
searched
for
that
purpose.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
why
could
not?
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
of
armed
robbery?
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
yes.
in
my
view
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
as
i
--
i
haven’t
looked
up
recently
the
technical
law
dictionary
definition
of
dicta.
yes,
it
was
dicta
in
that
the
facts
of
the
terry
case
mr.
justice
rehnquist
did
not
involve
the
precise
facts
of
this
case.
but
i
think
this
court
was
teaching
the
federal
judiciary
system
in
terry,
the
scope
limitation
principles
applicable
as
it
said
explicitly
to
all
intrusions
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
without
limitations.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
that’s
correct
and
i
think
that
our
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
was
not
guilty
of
an
aberration.
it
listened
to
that
teaching
in
this
decision.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
that's
right.
well,
but
factually,
in
peters
mr.
justice
there
was
a
justification
because
of
the
circumstances
for
a
search
evidentiary
in
nature
and
we
don’t
have
that
evidentiary
in
purpose.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
we
don’t
have
that
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
no,
the
court
in
peters,
mr.
justice
white
said
that
the
--
that
deci
--
that
search
be
properly
limited
to
its
evidentiary
and
protective
purposes.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
examine
its
contents
incident
to
the
arrest
for
the
theft
of
the
television
set?
i
wouldn’t
think
so
and
i
don’t
think
that
this
is
what
--
as
a
matter
of
law
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
i
would
not
want
to
get
that
particularized.
i
would
say
obviously
when
the
arrest
is
for
a
crime
for
which
there
is
no
evidence
as
with
the
situation
in
willie
--
with
willie
robinson
there
can
be
no
evidentiary
justification
for
the
search.
where
there
is
a
--
an
arrest
for
a
crime
where
a
--
an
experienced
police
officer
may
reasonably
expect
to
find
fruits,
instrumentalities
or
evidence
of
the
--
of
that
crime,
not
something
he
imagines
may
have
happened,
but
of
that
crime
for
which
the
arrest
is
being
made
on
the
person
or
the
defendant,
then
he
may
go
into
his
pockets.
he
is
not
restrained
and
if
it
were
a
--
for
the
crime
of
stealing
money,
i
would
think
if
he
discovered
a
cigarette
package
in
a
pocket,
he
could
examine
that
for
that
purpose.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
the
government
stipulates
that
in
that
case.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
i
think
in
the
light
of
the
record
in
this
case,
it
was
wrong
to
go
into
that
pocket.
on
cross-examination
at
the
remand
hearing,
sergeant
donaldson
was
asked
by
me
whether
if
officer
jenks
at
the
scene
had
in
fact
been
conducting
a
frisk
instead
of
what
he
termed
a
full
search
and
had
encountered
what
officer
jenks
had
encountered
when
he
placed
his
hand
on
robinson’s
left
breast
pocket,
namely
a
package
that
was
--
that
gave
when
it
was
squeezed,
had
no
sharp
edges,
didn’t
appear
to
be
of
appreciable
size
and
or
a
mass,
what
should
he
have
done?
and
officer
donaldson
who
instructs
metropolitan
police
officers
in
search
techniques
said
he
should
have
gone
on.
he
shouldn’t
have
even
gone
into
the
pocket.
now
that’s
in
the
record
of
this
case
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
if
i
may
ask
the
question
mr.
justice
brennan
by
coming
really
i
think
to
what
the
heart
of
this
case
is
as
far
as
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
--
of
this
search
is
the
balancing
job
placed
upon
courts
which
this
court
did
when
it
articulated
the
scope
limitation
principles.
it
--
that
in
--
by
articulating
those
principles,
this
court
did
not
set
out
a
definite
limited
--
limit
for
every
kind
of
search.
the
world
of
the
streets
of
the
district
of
columbia
is
not
the
fictional
world
of
ian
fleming.
our
streets
are
not
populated
by
james
bond
type
characters
or
like
mr.
newhouser
who
customarily
walk
about
the
streets
with
25
lethal
weapons
taped
or
secreted
upon
their
person.
one
can
imagine
that
a
james
bond
character
would
secrete
in
a
stiff
cigarette
package
a
potentially
lethal
weapon.
but
i
just
don’t
think
in
the
light
of
the
street
experience
of
police
officers
that
they
get
apprehensive
of
danger
to
themselves
even
in
a
close
proximity
custodial
situation
because
they
feel
what
their
experience
and
common
everyday
knowledge
tells
them
is
a
cigarette
package.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
it
would
not.
not
because
that’s
a
division
line
that
this
court
is
going
to
recognize
henceforth
but
it's
one
that
police
officers
do
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
do.
that
was
the
common
ground
of
the
plurality
and
the
dissenters
in
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
it
is
a
position
not
as
extreme
as
one
taken
in
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case
which
contends
that
not
even
a
terry
type
frisk
maybe
made
unless
there
is
that
apprehension
of
danger
which
the
officer
in
terry
experienced.
i
would
agree
that
the
necessity
for
protection
of
a
police
officer
in
the
full
custody
situation
whether
he
is
frightened
or
not
in
the
light
of
common
experience
is
serious
enough
to
warrant
at
least
of
the
terry
type
frisk
as
an
initial
search
following
where
it
will
with
reasonably
aroused
suspicions
on
the
part
of
police
officers.
now,
the
second
thing
to
the
government
argument
is
and
i’m
not
going
to
dwell
on
this
too
much
in
view
of
the
court's
questions
because
i
think
basically,
we
have
covered
it.
counsel
has
referred
to
metropolitan
police
department
standing
orders
and
metropolitan
police
department
regulations
with
respect
to
the
scope
of
the
search
of
a
person
incident
to
an
arrest.
there
simply
is
no
standing
order.
there's
simply
is
no
regulation.
what
this
record
refers
to
is
the
practice
of
the
metropolitan
police
as
revealed
through
the
testimony
of
sergeant
donaldson
as
to
the
manner
in
which
it
instructs
its
police
officers
and
it’s
true
that
sergeant
donaldson
did
say
that
in
a
custodial
arrest
situation,
we
require
a
full
search,
but
where
that
particular
bid
of
lore
grew
up
and
how
it
came
to
be
escalated
to
the
status
of
a
standing
order,
this
record
is
totally
silent.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
because
i
think
that
if
there
were
a
--
i
think
this
mr.
chief
justice,
the
difference
is
that
when
he
was
explored
--
when
his
testimony
was
explored
on
cross-examination,
sergeant
donaldson
came
out
as
a
much
more
sanguine
individual
about
the
circumstances
of
an
arrest
than
the
instructions
he
gave
would
make
him
to
a
rookie
policeman.
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
a
warrantless
search
that
what
this
instruction
contemplates
is
a
warrantless
search
to
begin
with.
and
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
that
being
an
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment
prohibition
against
such
searches
must
come
within
a
--
places
upon
those
who
would
come
within
it,
the
burden
of
meeting
the
zealously
drawn
outlines
of
the
exception.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
no.
no
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
we
are
saying
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
yes,
as
this
court
has
on
a
number
of
occasions
framed
the
search
incident
to
arrest
as
described
and
as
an
exception
to
the
prohibition
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
i
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
no
there
is
not
mr.
chief
justice
and
what
this
case
is
all
about
is
whether
or
not
there
should
be
some
limitation
on
the
scope
of
that
search.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
exactly.
now,
i
do
think
that
i
have
to
devote
some
of
my
time
in
argument
to
the
question
of
the
exclusionary
rule
because
even
if
in
the
light
of
the
record
of
this
case,
this
court
should
find
that
the
search
of
officer
--
of
willie
robinson
exceeded
permissible
limits,
there
is
still
another
hurdle
that
we
must
overcome
to
assure
his
continued
liberty.
the
government
urges
that
this
search
of
mr.
robinson
was
that
at
most
a
minimal
violation
of
his
rights,
that
it
was
neither
willful
nor
flagrant
and
that
the
exclusionary
rule
justified
as
a
deterrent
to
illegal
searches
and
seizures
as
a
demonstrable
failure.
and
considering
the
substantiality
of
this
violation,
this
evidence
even
though
illegally
seized
should
be
admitted.
i
need
not
remind
this
court
of
its
constant
and
necessity
for
its
constant
vigilance
with
respect
to
intrusions
on
personal
liberties.
as
long
ago
as
1886,
it
held
in
boyd
versus
the
united
states,
an
illegitimate
and
unconstitutional
practices
get
their
first
footing
in
that
way,
namely
by
silent
approaches
and
slight
deviations
from
legal
modes
and
procedure.
it
is
the
duty
of
courts
to
be
watchful
for
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
citizens
and
against
any
stealthy
encroachments
there
off.
if
we
are
to
be
left
to
the
good
faith
of
police
officers,
this
court
has
already
dealt
with
that
situation
because
in
terry
it
said,
“simple
good
faith
on
the
part
of
the
--
of
the
arresting
officer
is
not
enough.
if
subjective
good
faith
alone
were
the
test,
the
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment
would
evaporate
and
the
people
would
be
secured
in
their
persons,
houses,
papers
and
effects
only
in
the
discretion
of
the
police.”
i
think
that
it
can
be
fairly
said
that
the
government
stretches
a
point
when
it
says
in
its
brief
that
what
mr.
justice
powell
has
described
in
the
schneckloth
case
as
the
most
searching
empirical
study
of
the
efficacy
of
the
exclusionary
rule
when
the
government
suggested
it
is
a
failure.
professor
oaks,
the
author
of
that
article
does
argue
that
it
is
a
failure,
but
he
says
that
the
empirical
data
fall
short
of
establishing
that
the
rule
does
not
discourage
illegal
search.
but
deterrences
by
no
means,
the
only
justification
for
the
rule.
60
years
ago
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
in
weeks,
this
court
took
care
to
define
the
issue
in
these
fourth
amendment
cases
this
way.
the
question
is
the
right
of
a
court
in
a
criminal
prosecution
to
retain
for
the
purposes
of
evidence
the
papers
of
the
accused
seized
in
his
house
without
his
authority
and
without
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
and
none
for
the
search
of
his
premises.
this
court
then
held
in
that
case
that
if
a
trial
court
had
such
a
right,
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
of
no
value,
it
might
as
well
be
stricken
from
the
constitution.
six
years
later,
mr.
justice
holmes
said
if
that
would
be
the
case,
the
fourth
amendment
would
be
reduced
to
a
mere
form
of
words.
for
almost
60
years,
this
court
has
not
departed
from
this
essential
core
of
weekes.
and
over
those
decades,
it
has
thundered
to
every
court
in
the
federal
system
and
since
1961
to
the
states,
you
have
no
right,
the
courts,
to
obtain
and
you
shall
not
keep
and
use
against
an
accused
the
ill
gotten
gains
of
searches
which
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
this
--
the
weekes'
court
said,
is
one
of
those
great
principles
established
by
years
of
endeavor
and
suffering
and
it
must
not
be
given
up
lightly
even
in
a
case
where
constitutional
liberty
and
the
violation
of
constitutional
right
are
separated
by
the
fabric
line
of
a
coat
pocket.
this
court
has
urged
to
analogize
to
those
cases
in
which
less
than
perfect
miranda
warnings
have
not
resulted
in
the
exclusion
of
admissions
or
confessions.
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
analogy
limps
rather
bad.
the
constitution
does
not
require
miranda
warnings,
but
it
does
require
a
warrant
from
a
magistrate
to
permit
a
search
unless
the
exigencies
of
the
case
demand
otherwise,
the
exigency
being
an
arrest.
the
fifth
amendment
right
is
not
violated
absent
miranda
warnings
until
the
incriminating
statement
is
used
in
the
trial
against
the
defendant
to
making
a
witness
against
himself.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
the
miranda
decision
i
explain
mr.
justice
rehnquist
as
a
tool
to
ensure
the
voluntariness,
an
informed
making
of
incriminatory
--
incriminating
statements
before
they
are
used
against
the
defendant.
the
fifth
amendment
plainly
does
not
say
that
a
person
has
to
be
warned,
but
this
court
has
held
that
unless
informed
of
his
rights,
the
incriminating
statement
may
not
be
used
against
him.
but
the
fifth
--
fourth
amendment
situation
is
a
totally
different
thing.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
that’s
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
that’s
correct,
via
magistrate,
but
it
is
all
--
it
is
all
inclusive
with
respect
to
that
requirement,
but
the
fourth
amendment
transcript
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
i
didn’t
mean
to
imply
that
it
did.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
before
a
search
can
be
made
unless
the
search
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
the
courts
have
carved
out
the
exception
to
the
constitution,
no
doubt.
but
the
fourth
amendment
right
is
violated
when
this
literally,
a
trespass
is
committed.
and
that
is
why
the
miranda
argument
i
don’t
think
provides
an
adequate
guide
for
the
court
in
this
case.
what
we
seek
here
in
sum
is
a
limit
to
the
scope
of
a
protective
search
to
what
is
reasonably
necessary
for
protection.
we
ask
for
a
rule
which
as
this
record
shows
is
reasonable
and
compatible
with
--
in
the
light
of
the
street
experience
of
police
officers
and
can
be
simply
stated,
“officer
where
there
are
no
fruits,
instrumentalities
or
evidence
of
a
crime
to
be
gained
by
a
search,
limit
yourself
to
a
thorough
feeling
of
the
defendants
outer
clothing
and
if
you
feel
anything
you
think
maybe
a
weapon,
follow
the
lead
of
this
suspicion
until
your
suspicion
leaves.
take
away
from
the
defendant
any
package,
purse
or
other
container,
which
might
contain
a
weapon,
but
do
not
intrude
upon
his
person
or
effects
any
further
than
is
necessary
to
protect
yourself.”
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
i
think
that
is
a
crime
for
which
there
maybe
corroborating
evidence.
obviously
you
don’t
prove
a
crime
of
driving
under
the
influence
except
by
blood
test
or
breath
test,
but
the
presence
of
alcohol
in
a
flask
might
well
be
corroborating
evidence
to
support
charge.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
that’s
correct,
but
while
i’m
not
an
expert
in
the
matter,
i
think
that
the
discernable
odor
of
at
least
on
the
breath
[attempt
to
laughter]
of
an
arrestee
in
a
drunk
driving
case
is
different.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
in
this
case?
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
burger,
the
arrest
was
solely
because
officer
jenks
had
checked
the
metropolitan
police
traffic
records
and
knew
that
robinson
had
had
his
permit
lifted
and
had
obtained
a
new
one
under
false
pretext
and
he
stopped
him
after
having
ascertained
that
three
or
four
days
later.
to
make
the
arrest
for
specifically
that
charge,
there
was
no
improper
driving
or
any
other
indication.
and
so
we
say
this
police
officer
do
not
intrude
upon
the
person
of
the
arrestee
or
his
effects
any
further
than
is
necessary
to
protect
yourself.
this
is
part
of
the
law.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
this
is
part
of
the
law
and
that
you
are
sworn
to
up
--
that
you
are
sworn
to
uphold
the
rights
that
you
have
committed
to
defendant.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
we
understand
the
government’s
position
in
this
case,
it
basically
takes
three
themes.
first
of
all,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
terry
case,
the
sibron
case
or
the
peters
case
which
limits
the
scope
of
a
post
to
rest
search.
and
that
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
confused
two
distinct
sets
of
principles
applicable
to
fourth
amendment
searches
by
disregarding
the
significance
of
a
lawful
arrest.
the
second
theme
of
the
government’s
argument
is
that
the
metropolitan
police
departments
of
the
district
of
columbia,
instruction
to
its
police
officers
with
respect
to
the
extent
of
a
search
in
this
case,
this
type
of
case
is
a
reasonable
type
of
instruction
and
approach
that
a
terry
type
frisk
is
not
adequate
protection
in
the
instance
of
a
full
custody
arrest.
and
finally,
the
attack
upon
the
exclusionary
rule
and
the
request
that
it'd
be
modified
in
cases
of
this
type.
it
seems
to
us
clear
addressing
myself
to
the
first
point
that
in
terry,
this
court
rejected
a
notion
advanced
by
the
state
of
ohio
that
the
fourth
amendment
doesn’t
even
come
into
play
as
a
limitation
upon
police
conduct
if
the
officer
stopped
short
of
something
called
a
technical
arrest
or
a
full
blown
search.
and
this
court
went
further
to
say
that
the
sounder
course
of
analysis
in
fourth
amendment
cases
is
to
recognize
that
the
fourth
amendment
governs
all
intrusions
by
agents
of
the
public
upon
personal
security
and
to
make
the
scope
of
a
particular
intrusion
in
the
light
of
all
of
the
exigencies
of
the
case
a
central
element
in
the
analysis
of
reasonable
arrest.
then
in
peters
we
had
a
case
wherefore
the
purposes
of
constitution
analysis,
an
arrest
had
taken
place
when
officer
lasky
apprehended
peters
in
the
hallway
of
his
apartment.
and
this
court
said
with
respect
to
the
pat
down
type
of
search
that
was
conducted
by
officer
lasky
that
this
was
reasonably
limited
in
its
scope
to
its
evidentiary
and
protective
purposes
and
was
not
an
unrestrained
and
thorough
going
examination
of
the
arrestee
and
his
personal
effects.
now
the
government
has
pointed
out
in
this
case,
mr.
justice
harlan’s
observation
of
that
language
in
the
terry
decision.
mr.
justice
harlan
said,
“that’s
all
it
was,
an
observation”
and
that
the
court
was
--
and
in
other
words,
the
court
was
not
saying
in
terry
that
a
protective
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
is
limited
to
a
frisk.
but
this
court
in
chimel
shortly
after
terry
said
as
to
its
decision
in
peters
and
i
quote,
“we
sustain
the
search
in
peters,
however,
only
because
its
scope
had
been
reasonably
limited
by
the
need
to
seize
weapons
and
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
evidence.”
we
emphasized,
again
quoting
from
this
court’s
decision
that
the
arresting
officer
did
not
engage
in
an
unrestrained
and
through
going
examination
of
peters
and
his
personal
effects.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
in
--
certainly
in
peters,
this
case
was
--
this
court
was
taking
the
scope
limitation
principles
applied
truly
enough
in
a
different
context
in
terry
and
making
an
application
of
them
in
a
new
context,
a
post
arrest
situation.
and
in
sibron,
the
third
case
in
the
trilogy,
while
there,
the
court
found
that
--
this
court
found
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
the
arrest
and
that
the
circumstances
were
there
for
the
equivalent
of
the
stop
and
frisk
situation
confronting
the
officer
in
terry.
in
its
opinion,
it
assumed
arguendo
that
would
--
even
though
if
the
circumstances
of
apprehension
and
fear
had
been
present
in
the
sibron
case
as
they
had
been
in
terry,
thus
making
it
for
the
purposes
of
protection
of
a
police
officer
the
equivalent
of
a
post
arrest
situation,
then
the
search
into
sibron’s
pockets
was
going
too
far.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
i
am
reading
it
as
an
articulation
of
principles
mr.
chief
justice
that
apply
to
all
intrusions
and
since
a
search
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
is
an
intrusion,
yes
and
i
think
that
the
language
in
terry
is
rather
explicit
in
that
regard.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
the
court
found
it
(voice
overlap)
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
that’s
correct
but
they
did
--
this
court
did
take
pains
to
know
that
officer
lasky's
search
in
terry,
even
though
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
i’m
sorry,
in
peters.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
was
not
thorough
going
and
unrestrained
and
was
limited
to
the
purposes
for
which
it
could
be
made
which
justified
it
in
its
inception.
this
court
said
in
terry
--
this
court
has
held
in
the
past
and
that
is
why
i
think
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
this
circuit
was
not
in
aberration.
this
court
has
held
in
the
past
that
a
search
which
is
reasonable
at
its
inception
may
violate
the
fourth
amendment
by
virtue
of
its
intolerable
intensity
and
scope,
citing
authorities.
the
scope
of
the
search
must
be,
“strictly
tied
to
and
justified
by
the
circumstances
which
rendered
its
initiation
permissible
quoting
authorities
that
go
all
the
way
back
to
the
agnello
case.”
this
--
the
decision
of
our
court
of
appeals
was
not
in
aberration
if
terry
was
not
an
aberration
because
what
terry
was,
was
an
articulation
of
scope
limitation
principles
applicable
to
these
kinds
of
intrusions
and
our
case
presented
the
first
opportunity
to
apply
those
limitation
principles
to
a
post
custody
arrest
explicit
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
was
done
implicitly
in
the
terry,
sibron,
peters
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
yes.
i
think
there
are
scope
limitation
principles
even
where
a
search
is
justified
by
an
evidentiary
purpose.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
yes
there
is.
in
our
case
in
terms
of
a
reasonableness
of
the
arrest
by
all
means
because
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
the
reasonableness
of
the
search.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
yes
sir.
yes
mr.
justice
brennan
and
for
this
reason.
an
arrest
for
an
armed
robbery
clearly
would
justify
an
evidentiary
search
of
the
persons
for
the
fruits
or
the
instruments
or
the
instrumentalities
or
evidence
of
that
crime.
and
to
the
extent
that
those
might
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
found
upon
the
person
of
the
arrestee
given
the
circumstances
at
the
time
and
execution
of
the
arrest,
certainly,
he
could
be
searched
for
that
purpose.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
why
could
not?
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
of
armed
robbery?
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
yes.
in
my
view
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
as
i
--
i
haven’t
looked
up
recently
the
technical
law
dictionary
definition
of
dicta.
yes,
it
was
dicta
in
that
the
facts
of
the
terry
case
mr.
justice
rehnquist
did
not
involve
the
precise
facts
of
this
case.
but
i
think
this
court
was
teaching
the
federal
judiciary
system
in
terry,
the
scope
limitation
principles
applicable
as
it
said
explicitly
to
all
intrusions
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
without
limitations.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
that’s
correct
and
i
think
that
our
court
of
appeals
in
the
district
of
columbia
was
not
guilty
of
an
aberration.
it
listened
to
that
teaching
in
this
decision.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
that's
right.
well,
but
factually,
in
peters
mr.
justice
there
was
a
justification
because
of
the
circumstances
for
a
search
evidentiary
in
nature
and
we
don’t
have
that
evidentiary
in
purpose.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
yes
sir.
and
we
don’t
have
that
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
no,
the
court
in
peters,
mr.
justice
white
said
that
the
--
that
deci
--
that
search
be
properly
limited
to
its
evidentiary
and
protective
purposes.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
yes
sir.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
examine
its
contents
incident
to
the
arrest
for
the
theft
of
the
television
set?
i
wouldn’t
think
so
and
i
don’t
think
that
this
is
what
--
as
a
matter
of
law
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
i
would
not
want
to
get
that
particularized.
i
would
say
obviously
when
the
arrest
is
for
a
crime
for
which
there
is
no
evidence
as
with
the
situation
in
willie
--
with
willie
robinson
there
can
be
no
evidentiary
justification
for
the
search.
where
there
is
a
--
an
arrest
for
a
crime
where
a
--
an
experienced
police
officer
may
reasonably
expect
to
find
fruits,
instrumentalities
or
evidence
of
the
--
of
that
crime,
not
something
he
imagines
may
have
happened,
but
of
that
crime
for
which
the
arrest
is
being
made
on
the
person
or
the
defendant,
then
he
may
go
into
his
pockets.
he
is
not
restrained
and
if
it
were
a
--
for
the
crime
of
stealing
money,
i
would
think
if
he
discovered
a
cigarette
package
in
a
pocket,
he
could
examine
that
for
that
purpose.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
the
government
stipulates
that
in
that
case.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
i
think
in
the
light
of
the
record
in
this
case,
it
was
wrong
to
go
into
that
pocket.
on
cross-examination
at
the
remand
hearing,
sergeant
donaldson
was
asked
by
me
whether
if
officer
jenks
at
the
scene
had
in
fact
been
conducting
a
frisk
instead
of
what
he
termed
a
full
search
and
had
encountered
what
officer
jenks
had
encountered
when
he
placed
his
hand
on
robinson’s
left
breast
pocket,
namely
a
package
that
was
--
that
gave
when
it
was
squeezed,
had
no
sharp
edges,
didn’t
appear
to
be
of
appreciable
size
and
or
a
mass,
what
should
he
have
done?
and
officer
donaldson
who
instructs
metropolitan
police
officers
in
search
techniques
said
he
should
have
gone
on.
he
shouldn’t
have
even
gone
into
the
pocket.
now
that’s
in
the
record
of
this
case
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
if
i
may
ask
the
question
mr.
justice
brennan
by
coming
really
i
think
to
what
the
heart
of
this
case
is
as
far
as
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
--
of
this
search
is
the
balancing
job
placed
upon
courts
which
this
court
did
when
it
articulated
the
scope
limitation
principles.
it
--
that
in
--
by
articulating
those
principles,
this
court
did
not
set
out
a
definite
limited
--
limit
for
every
kind
of
search.
the
world
of
the
streets
of
the
district
of
columbia
is
not
the
fictional
world
of
ian
fleming.
our
streets
are
not
populated
by
james
bond
type
characters
or
like
mr.
newhouser
who
customarily
walk
about
the
streets
with
25
lethal
weapons
taped
or
secreted
upon
their
person.
one
can
imagine
that
a
james
bond
character
would
secrete
in
a
stiff
cigarette
package
a
potentially
lethal
weapon.
but
i
just
don’t
think
in
the
light
of
the
street
experience
of
police
officers
that
they
get
apprehensive
of
danger
to
themselves
even
in
a
close
proximity
custodial
situation
because
they
feel
what
their
experience
and
common
everyday
knowledge
tells
them
is
a
cigarette
package.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
it
would
not.
not
because
that’s
a
division
line
that
this
court
is
going
to
recognize
henceforth
but
it's
one
that
police
officers
do
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
do.
that
was
the
common
ground
of
the
plurality
and
the
dissenters
in
the
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals.
it
is
a
position
not
as
extreme
as
one
taken
in
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case
which
contends
that
not
even
a
terry
type
frisk
maybe
made
unless
there
is
that
apprehension
of
danger
which
the
officer
in
terry
experienced.
i
would
agree
that
the
necessity
for
protection
of
a
police
officer
in
the
full
custody
situation
whether
he
is
frightened
or
not
in
the
light
of
common
experience
is
serious
enough
to
warrant
at
least
of
the
terry
type
frisk
as
an
initial
search
following
where
it
will
with
reasonably
aroused
suspicions
on
the
part
of
police
officers.
now,
the
second
thing
to
the
government
argument
is
and
i’m
not
going
to
dwell
on
this
too
much
in
view
of
the
court's
questions
because
i
think
basically,
we
have
covered
it.
counsel
has
referred
to
metropolitan
police
department
standing
orders
and
metropolitan
police
department
regulations
with
respect
to
the
scope
of
the
search
of
a
person
incident
to
an
arrest.
there
simply
is
no
standing
order.
there's
simply
is
no
regulation.
what
this
record
refers
to
is
the
practice
of
the
metropolitan
police
as
revealed
through
the
testimony
of
sergeant
donaldson
as
to
the
manner
in
which
it
instructs
its
police
officers
and
it’s
true
that
sergeant
donaldson
did
say
that
in
a
custodial
arrest
situation,
we
require
a
full
search,
but
where
that
particular
bid
of
lore
grew
up
and
how
it
came
to
be
escalated
to
the
status
of
a
standing
order,
this
record
is
totally
silent.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
because
i
think
that
if
there
were
a
--
i
think
this
mr.
chief
justice,
the
difference
is
that
when
he
was
explored
--
when
his
testimony
was
explored
on
cross-examination,
sergeant
donaldson
came
out
as
a
much
more
sanguine
individual
about
the
circumstances
of
an
arrest
than
the
instructions
he
gave
would
make
him
to
a
rookie
policeman.
we
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
a
warrantless
search
that
what
this
instruction
contemplates
is
a
warrantless
search
to
begin
with.
and
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
that
being
an
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment
prohibition
against
such
searches
must
come
within
a
--
places
upon
those
who
would
come
within
it,
the
burden
of
meeting
the
zealously
drawn
outlines
of
the
exception.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
no.
no
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
we
are
saying
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
yes,
as
this
court
has
on
a
number
of
occasions
framed
the
search
incident
to
arrest
as
described
and
as
an
exception
to
the
prohibition
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
i
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
no
there
is
not
mr.
chief
justice
and
what
this
case
is
all
about
is
whether
or
not
there
should
be
some
limitation
on
the
scope
of
that
search.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
exactly.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
exactly.
now,
i
do
think
that
i
have
to
devote
some
of
my
time
in
argument
to
the
question
of
the
exclusionary
rule
because
even
if
in
the
light
of
the
record
of
this
case,
this
court
should
find
that
the
search
of
officer
--
of
willie
robinson
exceeded
permissible
limits,
there
is
still
another
hurdle
that
we
must
overcome
to
assure
his
continued
liberty.
the
government
urges
that
this
search
of
mr.
robinson
was
that
at
most
a
minimal
violation
of
his
rights,
that
it
was
neither
willful
nor
flagrant
and
that
the
exclusionary
rule
justified
as
a
deterrent
to
illegal
searches
and
seizures
as
a
demonstrable
failure.
and
considering
the
substantiality
of
this
violation,
this
evidence
even
though
illegally
seized
should
be
admitted.
i
need
not
remind
this
court
of
its
constant
and
necessity
for
its
constant
vigilance
with
respect
to
intrusions
on
personal
liberties.
as
long
ago
as
1886,
it
held
in
boyd
versus
the
united
states,
an
illegitimate
and
unconstitutional
practices
get
their
first
footing
in
that
way,
namely
by
silent
approaches
and
slight
deviations
from
legal
modes
and
procedure.
it
is
the
duty
of
courts
to
be
watchful
for
the
constitutional
rights
of
the
citizens
and
against
any
stealthy
encroachments
there
off.
if
we
are
to
be
left
to
the
good
faith
of
police
officers,
this
court
has
already
dealt
with
that
situation
because
in
terry
it
said,
“simple
good
faith
on
the
part
of
the
--
of
the
arresting
officer
is
not
enough.
if
subjective
good
faith
alone
were
the
test,
the
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment
would
evaporate
and
the
people
would
be
secured
in
their
persons,
houses,
papers
and
effects
only
in
the
discretion
of
the
police.”
i
think
that
it
can
be
fairly
said
that
the
government
stretches
a
point
when
it
says
in
its
brief
that
what
mr.
justice
powell
has
described
in
the
schneckloth
case
as
the
most
searching
empirical
study
of
the
efficacy
of
the
exclusionary
rule
when
the
government
suggested
it
is
a
failure.
professor
oaks,
the
author
of
that
article
does
argue
that
it
is
a
failure,
but
he
says
that
the
empirical
data
fall
short
of
establishing
that
the
rule
does
not
discourage
illegal
search.
but
deterrences
by
no
means,
the
only
justification
for
the
rule.
60
years
ago
as
mr.
justice
stewart
pointed
out
in
weeks,
this
court
took
care
to
define
the
issue
in
these
fourth
amendment
cases
this
way.
the
question
is
the
right
of
a
court
in
a
criminal
prosecution
to
retain
for
the
purposes
of
evidence
the
papers
of
the
accused
seized
in
his
house
without
his
authority
and
without
a
warrant
for
his
arrest
and
none
for
the
search
of
his
premises.
this
court
then
held
in
that
case
that
if
a
trial
court
had
such
a
right,
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
of
no
value,
it
might
as
well
be
stricken
from
the
constitution.
six
years
later,
mr.
justice
holmes
said
if
that
would
be
the
case,
the
fourth
amendment
would
be
reduced
to
a
mere
form
of
words.
for
almost
60
years,
this
court
has
not
departed
from
this
essential
core
of
weekes.
and
over
those
decades,
it
has
thundered
to
every
court
in
the
federal
system
and
since
1961
to
the
states,
you
have
no
right,
the
courts,
to
obtain
and
you
shall
not
keep
and
use
against
an
accused
the
ill
gotten
gains
of
searches
which
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
this
--
the
weekes'
court
said,
is
one
of
those
great
principles
established
by
years
of
endeavor
and
suffering
and
it
must
not
be
given
up
lightly
even
in
a
case
where
constitutional
liberty
and
the
violation
of
constitutional
right
are
separated
by
the
fabric
line
of
a
coat
pocket.
this
court
has
urged
to
analogize
to
those
cases
in
which
less
than
perfect
miranda
warnings
have
not
resulted
in
the
exclusion
of
admissions
or
confessions.
i
respectfully
submit
that
that
analogy
limps
rather
bad.
the
constitution
does
not
require
miranda
warnings,
but
it
does
require
a
warrant
from
a
magistrate
to
permit
a
search
unless
the
exigencies
of
the
case
demand
otherwise,
the
exigency
being
an
arrest.
the
fifth
amendment
right
is
not
violated
absent
miranda
warnings
until
the
incriminating
statement
is
used
in
the
trial
against
the
defendant
to
making
a
witness
against
himself.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
the
miranda
decision
i
explain
mr.
justice
rehnquist
as
a
tool
to
ensure
the
voluntariness,
an
informed
making
of
incriminatory
--
incriminating
statements
before
they
are
used
against
the
defendant.
the
fifth
amendment
plainly
does
not
say
that
a
person
has
to
be
warned,
but
this
court
has
held
that
unless
informed
of
his
rights,
the
incriminating
statement
may
not
be
used
against
him.
but
the
fifth
--
fourth
amendment
situation
is
a
totally
different
thing.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
that’s
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
that’s
correct,
via
magistrate,
but
it
is
all
--
it
is
all
inclusive
with
respect
to
that
requirement,
but
the
fourth
amendment
transcript
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
i
didn’t
mean
to
imply
that
it
did.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
before
a
search
can
be
made
unless
the
search
--
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
the
courts
have
carved
out
the
exception
to
the
constitution,
no
doubt.
but
the
fourth
amendment
right
is
violated
when
this
literally,
a
trespass
is
committed.
and
that
is
why
the
miranda
argument
i
don’t
think
provides
an
adequate
guide
for
the
court
in
this
case.
what
we
seek
here
in
sum
is
a
limit
to
the
scope
of
a
protective
search
to
what
is
reasonably
necessary
for
protection.
we
ask
for
a
rule
which
as
this
record
shows
is
reasonable
and
compatible
with
--
in
the
light
of
the
street
experience
of
police
officers
and
can
be
simply
stated,
“officer
where
there
are
no
fruits,
instrumentalities
or
evidence
of
a
crime
to
be
gained
by
a
search,
limit
yourself
to
a
thorough
feeling
of
the
defendants
outer
clothing
and
if
you
feel
anything
you
think
maybe
a
weapon,
follow
the
lead
of
this
suspicion
until
your
suspicion
leaves.
take
away
from
the
defendant
any
package,
purse
or
other
container,
which
might
contain
a
weapon,
but
do
not
intrude
upon
his
person
or
effects
any
further
than
is
necessary
to
protect
yourself.”
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
i
think
that
is
a
crime
for
which
there
maybe
corroborating
evidence.
obviously
you
don’t
prove
a
crime
of
driving
under
the
influence
except
by
blood
test
or
breath
test,
but
the
presence
of
alcohol
in
a
flask
might
well
be
corroborating
evidence
to
support
charge.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
that’s
correct,
but
while
i’m
not
an
expert
in
the
matter,
i
think
that
the
discernable
odor
of
at
least
on
the
breath
[attempt
to
laughter]
of
an
arrestee
in
a
drunk
driving
case
is
different.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
in
this
case?
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
mr.
justice
--
chief
justice
burger,
the
arrest
was
solely
because
officer
jenks
had
checked
the
metropolitan
police
traffic
records
and
knew
that
robinson
had
had
his
permit
lifted
and
had
obtained
a
new
one
under
false
pretext
and
he
stopped
him
after
having
ascertained
that
three
or
four
days
later.
to
make
the
arrest
for
specifically
that
charge,
there
was
no
improper
driving
or
any
other
indication.
and
so
we
say
this
police
officer
do
not
intrude
upon
the
person
of
the
arrestee
or
his
effects
any
further
than
is
necessary
to
protect
yourself.
this
is
part
of
the
law.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
joseph
v.
gartlan,
jr.
this
is
part
of
the
law
and
that
you
are
sworn
to
up
--
that
you
are
sworn
to
uphold
the
rights
that
you
have
committed
to
defendant.
