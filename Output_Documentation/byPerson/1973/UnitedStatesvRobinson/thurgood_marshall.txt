justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he
be
handcuffed?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he
handcuff
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
the
officer
be
pretty
safe
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
also
am
aware
of
a
prisoner
that
was
shot
and
killed
while
handcuffed
and
shackled.
what's
that
got
to
do
with
my
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
ask
you
what
i
asked
in
the
other
case,
once
he
had
this
crumpled
package
of
cigarettes
in
his
hand,
i
understand
you're
not
relying
on
the
evidentiary
search,
am
i
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
once
he
had
this
possible
weapon
in
his
hand,
how
could
the
prisoner
use
that
weapon?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that
go
for
a
wallet?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
there
anything
on
the
man’s
possession
--
in
his
possession
that
is
safe
from
search
and
seizure,
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
would
include
a
handkerchief?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn’t
include
a
handkerchief?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
nothing
safe?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
just
trying
to
have
something
in
mind
that
would
be
safe.
that’s
all
i’m
trying
to
do.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
then
it
depends
on
what
you
find
in
it.
that
--
what’s
found
in
it
justifies
the
search.
you're
not
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i’m
sure
you're
not.
[laughter
attempt]
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
what
could
he
have
found
in
there
that
would’ve
endangered
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
it
was
folded
up
like
this,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
folded
up
like
this.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
it
wasn’t
razor
blade,
was
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
it
could’ve
been
that
many.
justice
thurgood
marshall
a
collapsible
razor
blade.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
with
things
taped
all
over
his
body.
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
he
have
a
letter
bomb
on
him?
justice
thurgood
marshall
then
how
did
he
forget
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point
is
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
granting
that
he
had
the
right
to
take
the
package
out,
a
crumpled
(inaudible),
why
did
he
have
to
open
it,
that’s
my
only
point?
justice
thurgood
marshall
other
than
to
search
for
evidence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
he
have
given
it
back
to
him
if
there
was
nothing
in
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he
be
handcuffed?
justice
thurgood
