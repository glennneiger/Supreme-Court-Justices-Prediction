well,
then
you
apparently
want
to
litigate
the
specific
facts
of
every
arrest
when
there's
a
search
for
weapons?
justice
byron
r.
white
that’s
right,
that’s
fairly
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
like,
you
could
search
in
a
crumpled
cigarette
package?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
--
could
you
search
in
a
crumpled
cigarette
package?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
court
justified
it
as
a
weapon
search
in
peters?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
protective?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
so
in
the
example
awhile
ago,
you
said
that
you
might
be
able
to
search
in
a
cigarette
package
in
case
of
arrest
for
some
purposes,
but
not
further.
now,
if
you
arrest
a
man
in
his
house
for
stealing
television
sets
and
there's
a
crumpled
cigarette
package
in
his
pocket,
you
would
say
you
couldn’t
search
in
the
package
in
that
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
would
--
really
would
depend
in
each
case
on
what
the
arrest
was
for
and
what
kind
of
evidence
there
might
be
of
a
particular
kind
of
crime?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
constitution
doesn’t
say
that
warrant
shall
issue
for
every
search?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
says
that
warrants
shall
not
issue
except
for
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
says
when
the
warrants
have
to
issue?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn’t
say
when
warrants
have
to
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
said
that
it
did?
the
constitution
said
warrants
have
to
issue?

that
isn't
