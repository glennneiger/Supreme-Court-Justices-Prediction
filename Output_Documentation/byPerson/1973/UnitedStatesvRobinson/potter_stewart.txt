justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
thought
you
--
justice
potter
stewart
general
tuttle,
i
thought
you're
argument
was
and
maybe
it’s
what
you’ve
said
that
if
there
is
a
valid
arrest
of
a
person,
then
the
law
--
the
settled
law
is
that
there
is
--
there
can
be
a
constitutionally
a
valid,
complete
search
of
his
person.
the
rationale
for
that
being
that
he
might
have
weapons
that
that
there
might
be
destructible
evidence,
but
what
is
the
rationale
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
law,
the
constitutional
law
is
that
there
can
be
a
complete
search
of
his
person,
isn’t
it
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well
a
broader
search
looking
in
body
cavities
and
what
not,
we’re
talking
--
not
talking
about
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that’s
what
i
thought
your
argument
was
and
that’s
the
reason
i
didn’t
really
quite
understand
your
question
of
one
of
the
--
your
answer
to
one
of
the
questions
from
the
bench
that
it
might
make
a
difference
whether
a
razor
blade
were
found
or
were
not
found
in
the
scene,
the
cigarette
--
justice
potter
stewart
because
i
thought
your
basic
argument
was
that
when
there's
a
valid
custodial
arrest,
there
can
be
a
full
field
search.
isn't
that
your
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
search
--
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
been
the
law
until
now,
hasn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
alright
and
until
this
case
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
potter
stewart
(voice
overlap)
holding
one
--
justice
potter
stewart
and
it
was
not
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
court
held
there
that
it
was
not
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest.
it’s
the
same
as
stoner
against
california.
it
was
simply
not
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest.
justice
potter
stewart
but
that
question
doesn’t
exist
here
--
justice
potter
stewart
that
last
branch
of
your
argument
would
--
is
in
effect
asking
us
to
overrule
weeks
against
united
states,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
decided
1914,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
yes,
but
weeks
established
the
exclusionary
rule
as
such
in
the
lower
courts.
justice
potter
stewart
peters
is,
if
i
remember
it
correctly,
tell
me
if
i’m
wrong,
but
the
peters
case
did
involve
a
lawful
arrest,
did
it
not?
court
here
--
justice
potter
stewart
court
here
found
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
and
that
--
in
that
search
therefore
was
by
definition
incident
to
a
lawful
arrest.
justice
potter
stewart
in
terry
or
in
peters?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
what
i
thought.
justice
potter
stewart
and
the
peters
case
is
really
an
all
force
with
your
case,
isn’t
it,
constitutionally
because
there,
there
was
a
valid
arrest?
justice
potter
stewart
that
was
a
prowler
in
the
bronx
apartment,
if
i
remember
the
case,
was
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
chimel
put
a
limitation
upon
the
geographic
scope
of
the
--
of
such
a
search?
justice
potter
stewart
only,
it
only
dealt
with
the
geographic
scope
did
it
not
really
and
your
submission
today
is
that
there
ought
to
be
a
limitation
upon
the
scope
of
the
intensity
of
the
search
within
that
geographic
area?
justice
potter
stewart
the
terry
situation,
you
don’t
put
him
beside
you
in
a
cruiser.
that’s
just
a
brief
straight
encounter.
justice
potter
stewart
oh
i
thought
you
meant
to
take
him
down
to
jail?
justice
potter
stewart
no.
justice
potter
stewart
i
see.
