i
--
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you,
but
i
think
you
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case
by
a
divided
vote?
justice
potter
stewart
i
missed
that,
is
there
a
dissenting
opinion?
justice
potter
stewart
i
think
it
was
unanimous.
justice
potter
stewart

i
just
wanted
to
be
sure
i
hadn’t
missed
something.
justice
potter
stewart
