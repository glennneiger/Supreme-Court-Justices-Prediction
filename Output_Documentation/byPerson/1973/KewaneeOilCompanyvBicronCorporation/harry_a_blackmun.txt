justice
harry
a.
blackmun
general
griswold,
there
were
some
of
us
who
dissented
in
goldstein
last
term.
do
you
think
our
position
is
inconsistent
with
yours
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
i
wanted
to
be
sure
about
you
reference
to
coca
cola.
this
has
been
my
impression
that
this
is
a
long-term
classic
example
of
a
trade
secret
that
has
never
been
discovered,
right?
justice
harry

mr.

blackmun
mr.
mccoy
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
mccoy,
you’ve
used
the
public
domain
twice
now.
can
you
draw
any
distinction
between
public
domain
and
public
use?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
take
it
that
coca
cola
is
in
public
use,
i
suppose
that
coke
people
would
question
whether
it’s
in
the
public
domain
and
i
take
it
that
the
solicitor
general
would
take
the
same
position
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
suppose
it
were,
what
your
answer
would
be
--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
take
it
then
you
would
say
it
is
not
on
the
public
domain?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
is?
