mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court,
pardon
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
permit
me
to
begin
by
reference
to
the
specific,
precise
injunction
that’s
before
the
court
and
that
appears
at
page
92
to
94
of
the
appendix
and
this
is
a
permanent
injunction
in
the
part
--
the
only
aspect
of
it
that
is
not
permanent,
is
paragraph
d
where
it
says,
“it
is
ordered
that
defendants,
bicron
and
the
individual
respondents
shall
not
be
restrained
by
this
injunction
from
using
any
trade
secret
of
plaintiff
after
it
has
been
released
to
the
public
by
plaintiff,
such
as
by
the
issuance
of
a
patent
or
as
otherwise
become
generally
available
to
the
public,
or
other
members
of
the
industry,
or
is
obtained
by
defendants
from
sources
having
a
legal
right
to
convey
such
information.”
and
i
also
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
title
of
this
injunction
that
says,
“order
for
permanent
injunction.”
now,
the
--
there
was
no
award
of
damages
by
the
district
court
and
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
to
reverse
the
district
court
and
remand
for
a
dismissal
of
the
complaint.
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
appears
at
page
26
of
the
petitioner’s
--
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
their
writ
of
certiorari.
now,
still
going
to
the
--
if
i
may,
your
honors,
refer
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
it’s
at
page
a7
of
the
certiorari
petition
where
the
sixth
circuit
characterized
the
issue
that
it
felt
was
in
front
of
them.
and
the
sixth
circuit
said,
“therefore,
the
issue
presented
to
this
court
in
the
instant
case
maybe
summarized
as
follows.
whether
a
state
trade
secret
law
which
protects
an
invention
which
would
be
an
appropriate
subject
for
a
patent
under
the
patent
laws
of
the
united
states
and
which
has
been
used
commercially
for
more
than
one
year
conflicts
with
the
policies
and
purposes
of
article
1,
section
8,
clause
8
of
the
constitution
and
the
patent
laws
adopted
pursuant
thereto.”
now,
this
is
the
last
thing
i’ll
read.
if
i
may
go
back
to
page
6
of
the
appendix
also
in
the
same
sixth
circuit
opinion,
the
--
this
is
setting
up
their
question,
the
sixth
circuit
says,
“we
must
determine
whether
the
trade
secret
laws
of
the
state
of
ohio
are
required
to
be
struck
down
in
this
case
as
being
in
conflict
with
the
united
states
patent
laws,
and
if
so,
to
what
extent?”
kewanee
urges
that
the
issue
presented
to
this
court
requires
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
enforcement
of
any
and
all
state
trade
secret
laws
conflict
with
the
policy
of
the
united
states
patent
laws.
thus
framed,
we
consider
the
issue
too
broad
for
our
consideration
in
this
case.
now,
as
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief,
we
say
the
issue
is
a
permanent
injunction
granted
by
a
district
court
as
to
subject
matter,
the
trade
secret
subject
matter,
in
conflict
with
the
patent
laws
of
the
united
states.
if
the
specific
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes,
that
is
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
yes
i
was
coming
to
that,
but
the
thing
is
we
don’t
think
that
coca
cola
is
--
that’s
a
trade
secret
that’s
outside
of
the
scope
of
what
we’re
dealing
with
now.
the
kind
of
trade
secrets
we’re
dealing
with
are
first
trade
secrets
that
are
patentable
subject
matter
as
provided
in
the
patent
code
35
u.s.c
101
and
coca
cola
in
our
view
is
a
food
recipe
and
it
would
not
be
susceptible
of
getting
a
patent.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
would
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
would
--
may
i
suggest
--
i
would
say
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
sears,
compco
and
lear
that
if
a
man
applies
for
a
patent
and
its
held
not
patentable
and
it's
been
in
public
use
for
more
than
a
year,
he
could
not
get
an
injunction
to
prohibit
somebody
else
even
if
there
is
a
--
what
is
argued
is
that
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
would
say
it’s
a
conflict,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
want
to
be
careful,
your
honor.
i
say
that
the
aspect
of
the
state
trade
secret
law
that
--
that
is
in
front
of
this
court
is
the
injunction
only,
and
i
say
as
to
if
a
man
files
for
a
patent
application
and
it’s
rejected
and
he
can’t
get
a
patent
application,
he
should
not
be
able
to
get
injunctive
relief.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
the
circumstances
in
which
patent
applications
are
filed,
the
number
of
patent
applications,
there’s
no
license
activity
whatsoever.
and
i
think
that
the
idea
there’s
an
election
theory
and
this
is
what
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
correct,
yes
and
actually
the
word
they
used
is
not
secret,
it’s
confidential.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
i
think
your
--
with
all
due
respect
your
honor,
your
--
your
--
i
--
the
patent
office
as
i
understand
it
would
never
disclose
a
patent
application.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
why
sure.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
and
it’s
that
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
you’re
attaching
much
--
too
much
important
to
that
--
importance
to
that
provision.
the
other
people
have
cited.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
alright.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
alright,
may
i
please
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
they’ve
cited
a
number
of
other
statutes.
for
example,
one
corporation
deals
with
the
sec,
it
discloses
its
inner
workings
and
financial
information,
and
the
government
is
forbidden
against
disclosure
of
that
information.
and
there,
they’ve
cited
a
number
of
statutes
here
where
the
idea
is,
in
our
view,
that
when
you
deal
the
government’s
--
if
it’s
important
to
the
person
making
a
submission
the
government
says,
“we
will
keep
that
confidential,
we’ll
not
disclose
it.”
now
the
government
isn’t
in
the
patent
statutes
or
the
scc
statues
or
anything
else,
they’re
not
saying,
“we
thereby
put
an
imprimatur
on
this
sort
of
relief
that’s
provided
--
that
was
provided
in
district
court
in
this
case.”
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
that’s
the
practice,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
certainly
yes,
i
see
no
problem
with
it.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
think
the
real
purpose
is
to
let
a
man
with
an
invention
deal
with
the
patent
office
in
confidence
in
knowing
that
he
has
an
invention
and
he
thinks
it’s
a
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
i
think
it’s
the
same
rationale.
the
man
has
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
they
--
it
isn’t
saying
it
will
keep
the
dis
--
it
--
what
they
say
is,
“we’ll
not
disclose
what
you’ve
disclosed
to
us.”
so
the
man
feels
free
to
disclose
an
invention.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
think
the
purpose
is
to
make
people
feel
free
to
deal
with
the
u.s.
patent
office.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
you
mean
by
an
individual
against
the
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
suppose
they
would.
i’m
not
aware
of
anybody
has
done
that.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
no,
i’m
not
saying
that
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
correct.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
no
he
couldn’t.
i
don’t
think
he
should
be
able
to
do
that
either.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
think
the
relief
of
--
in
the
court
of
equity
should
be,
in
that
situation
against
disclosure
of
the
trade
secret
because
there
they're
assuming
it’s
not
disclosed
in
the
product
that
they’re
selling.
as
far
as
the
use
is
concerned
that
is
--
it
can
always
be
measured
by
a
reasonable
royalties.
the
idea
of
a
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
they
have
the
same
concept
with
respect
to
trade
secrets
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i’m
saying
that
if
three
examiners
in
the
patent
office
taking
your
example,
leave
the
patent
office
and
--
and
there’s
been
a
disclosure
in
confidence
to
them
and
they
then
setup
and
start
abusing
the
disclosure
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes,
i
say
that
they
should
be
enjoined
against
any
further
disclosure
of
their
--
of
the
secrets,
assuming
it’s
not
disclosed
when
they
use
it.
in
other
words,
if
the
irreparable
harm
has
not
been
done,
then
they
should
be
enjoined
from
doing
it.
as
for
use,
i
would
say
that
you
can
always
measure
the
damages
by
the
use,
by
in
effect
the
same
rules
that
you
apply
in
a
patent
royalty
accounting.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
i’m
not
sure
what
case
you’re
talking
about
your
honor
that
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
--
the
case
right
in
front
of
you?
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
there’s
been
no
use
of
the
invention
in
this
case.
our
people
haven’t
used
these
secrets
at
all
and
i
say
that
there
--
that
the
--
and
there
is
no
real
threat
of
disclosure.
so
i
say
there
should
be
no
injunction
whatsoever.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
i’d
say
if
our
people
use
it
in
production
and
abuse
a
confidence,
then
there
should
be
damage
relief,
but
there
should
not
be
any
injunctive
relief
because
when
they
give
injunctive
relief,
you’re
enjoining
somebody
from
doing
something
where
the
kewanee
people
rejected
the
idea
of
federal
patent
protection.
they
could
not
get
a
patent
--
they
couldn’t
get
a
patent
injunction.
they’re
getting
better
relief
under
the
state
trade
secret
laws
than
they
could
get
under
the
patent
laws
and
that’s
where
i
say
there’s
a
conflict.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
by
the
nature
of
the
amici
brief
that
seems
to
be
the
case,
yes.
there
seems
to
be
a
flight
from
the
patent
system
over
to
a
trade
secret
system.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
no.
but
that
is
sort
of
--
that’s
in
a
way
an
illusionary
argument.
the
relief
that
you
want
in
this
case,
there
are
three
u.s.
companies
--
three
u.s.
competitors
of
kewanee,
bicron
is
the
fourth.
now
there
--
assuming
they
had
a
patent,
there
are
only
four
people
they’ve
even
considered
silly.
what
i’m
saying
is
that
i
don’t
say
that
it’s
equivalent
to
a
patent
monopoly,
but
for
practical
purposes,
it’s
very
close
to
it.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
no
question
about
it.
if
i
may
go
back
to
mr.
justice
white’s
--
your
other
question
was
the
man
who
gets
the
abandoned
patent
is
rejected,
there
is
a
sixth
circuit
case
of
american
gauge
versus
maasdam,
245
f2d
62,
where
an
individual
made
a
contract
with
a
corporation
for
the
manufacture
of
the
wire
stretcher
for
fences,
and
a
patent
application
was
filed
and
the
patent
application
was
rejected.
and
the
individual
received
royalties
for
a
period
of
time
and
then
he
did
not
advise
the
corporation
that
the
patent
application
had
been
rejected,
and
then
the
corporation
terminated
his
contract,
and
the
corporation
continued
to
sell
stretchers.
so
the
individual
sued
for
unjust
enrichment
and
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
the
individual
had
the
right
along
with
the
rest
of
the
world
to
produce
and
sell
wire
stretchers.
and
they
cited
singer
v.
june,
kellogg,
west
point
that
series
of
cases
which
are
cited
in
sears,
compco.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well
i
think
it
helps
me
on
the
idea
that
if
a
person
submits
an
idea
to
the
patent
office,
and
the
patent
office
says
that
it’s
not
patentable
subject
matter,
then
that
--
he
should
not
be
enjoined
from
doing
that
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
it
was
disclosed
in
secrecy
to
the
corporation,
and
it
was
in
a
factory,
i
think
it
certainly
was
secret,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well
it
would
be
publicly
used
in
accordance
with
the
patent
laws,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
that’s
correct.
the
patent
office
said
we
--
said
--
the
patent
office
considered
the
development,
and
said
it
doesn’t
rise,
it’s
not
a
patentable
subject
matter.
so
if
the
sixth
circuit
had
granted
an
injunction
the
effect
would
be
to
give
injunctive
relief
under
state
trade
secret
laws
where
there
would
be
no
such
relief
under
the
patent
statutes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
there
probably
be
an
implied
contract
to
that
effect.
but
i
don’t
know
whether
--
i
don’t
know
the
nature
of
the
contract.
i’d
like
to
pick
up
where
general
griswold
was
talking
about
the
subject
matter
of
--
that’s
before
the
court,
and
by
that
i
mean
the
sodium
iodide
thallium
activated
crystals.
that
they
are
used
in
--
that
this
is
a
subject
matter
which
is
very
vital
to
this
country
at
this
point
in
time.
it’s
detecting
malignant
tumors
in
medicine.
it’s
used
in
oil
exploration.
it’s
used
in
the
location
of
uranium
oil.
this
is
a
substance,
and
i
of
course
enjoining
a
parallel
with
the
subject
matter
in
goldstein
which
depending
upon
you
age
group,
is
or
is
not
substance.
now,
the
specific
trade
secrets
involved
in
this
case
are
set
out
in
volume
1
of
the
appendix
in
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
pages
108
to
110,
in
case
you
want
to
look
at
them.
the
point
i
want
to
make
there
is
that
those
trade
secrets
are
not
described
in
the
way
a
patent
is
described,
they’re
merely
identified.
you
just
look
at
it
it’s
just
a
1
or
2
or
3
line,
that’s
all.
now
the
cases
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
okay.
[luncheon
recess]
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court?
i’d
like
to
pick
up
on
this
matter
of
the
section
122
of
the
patent
statute.
i
have
two
very
brief
points.
the
first
one
is,
that
in
our
view
the
purpose
of
that
statute
is
no
different
than
any
of
the
other
statutes
that
have
been
cited
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner,
and
secondly
that
if
somebody
violates
anyone
of
those
statutes
a
relief
is
provided
at
--
in
section
19
u.s.c.,
1905,
it's
page
1
(a)
of
the
petitioner’s
appendix.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
you
file
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes,
it
would
--
but
it
would
include
other
kinds
too.
it
would
include
an
application
where
it’s
been
denied
and
you
determine
that
--
you
don’t
think
you’re
going
to
get
good
enough
protection
so
you
don’t
press
it,
i
mean
it’s
a
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
the
cases
we
rely
upon
and
that
the
sixth
circuit
relied
upon
where
the
sears,
compco
&
lear
in
a
nutshell,
we
read
those
cases
to
hold
three
things.
first,
that
there
is
a
strong
federal
policy
favoring
the
full
and
free
use
of
ideas
in
the
public
domain.
secondly,
that
the
public
domain
is
anything
which
is
not
protected
by
a
patent
copyright
or
trademark.
that
concept
is
developed
in
our
brief,
but
i
think
that’s
a
fair
definition
of
the
public
domain,
and
if
i
may,
i
believe
it’s
discussed
in
somewhat
different
context
in
the
majority
opinion
in
goldstein.
i’m
not
--
i
don’t
have
the
official
report,
but
where
this
court
said,
“in
regard
to
mechanical
configurations,
congress
has
balanced
the
need
to
encourage
innovation
and
originality
of
invention
against
the
need
to
ensure
competition
in
the
sale
of
identical
or
substantially
identical
products.
the
standards
established
for
granting
federal
patent
protection
to
machines,
thus
indicated
not
only
which
articles
in
this
particular
category,
congress
wish
to
protect,
but
which
configurations
it
wish
to
remain
free.
the
application
of
state
law
in
these
cases
to
prevent
the
copying
of
articles
which
did
not
meet
the
requirements
for
a
federal
protection
disturbed
the
careful
balance
which
congress
had
drawn,
and
thereby
necessarily
gave
way
under
the
supremacy
cause
of
the
constitution.”
now,
there
--
i
believe
a
further
development
of
that
concept
is
the
thought
that
this
word
public,
when
you
speak
of
public
domain,
maybe
it’s
a
little
confusing.
i
think
that
the
thrust
of
the
sears,
compco
cases
are
if
you
have
intellectual
property
and
you
wish
to
protect
it,
get
yourself
a
patent,
or
a
copyright
or
a
trademark.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
you
can
protect
yourself
by
a
contract
your
honor,
with
--
like
these
service
agreements.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
i
can’t
say
its
irrelevant,
but
i
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
say
they’re
not
enforceable.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
as
far
as
an
injunction
is
concerned.
i
say
they
can’t
enjoin
them
from
using.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
say
you
can
get
damages
and
the
cases
that
discuss,
there
is
a
dissent
in
a
second
circuit
case.
it’s
franke
v.
wiltschek,
209
f2d
493,
a
dissent
by
a
judge
frank
where
he
made
that
very
point.
he
said,
“you
can’t
get
an
injunction,
you
can
get
damages”.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i’m
afraid
it
isn’t
your
honor,
i
would
know.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
alright,
it’s
franke
v.
wiltschek,
209
f2d
493.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
1953,
second
circuit.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
it's
209
f2d
493.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
my
--
with
respect
to
coca
cola,
i
say
this
your
honor,
that
coca
cola
is
not
patentable
subject
matter.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
my
answer
would
be
there
would
be
a
public
use.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i’d
say
it
is
in
the
public
domain,
too.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
by
the
definition
of
this
court
in
sears,
compco
&
lear.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
the
contract
forbids
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
it
should
not,
correct.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
correct,
and
if
i
may
go
back
your
honor,
the
sixth
circuit
has
had
really
three
cases
before
it
on
trade
secrets.
your
confusion
arises
by
reason
of
the
way
the
petitioner
is
characterizing
this
case.
they’re
saying,
“we’re
trying
to
outlaw
all
trade
secret
agreements,
all
know
how.
we’re
trying
to
upset
the
balance
of
payments”
and
we
say
no.
all
we’re
concerned
with
is
the
narrow
question
of
an
injunction
of
former
employees
in
this
case
where
the
harshaw
chemical
company
dealing
with
subject
matter
of
vital
interest
to
this
country.
these
are
the
sodium
iodide
thallium
activated
crystals.
they
chose
to
avoid
the
patent
system,
where
if
they
had
patented
it,
they
could’ve
gotten
their
injunction.
instead
of
going
through
the
patent
system,
they
said,
“we’re
smarter.
we’ll
stay
out
of
it”
and
suddenly
a
situation
arose
and
then
they
come
in,
and
they
wanted
to
get
and
they
got
a
permanent
injunction
which
is
better
than
any
relief
they
could’ve
gotten
in
the
patent
system.
and
we
say
that
is
a
--
there
is
a
--
they’re
defeating
the
purposes
of
the
patent
system
and
that
isn’t
correct.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
with
all
due
[attempt
to
laughter]
respect
further
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
came
from
about
that.
i
don’t
know
if
their
--
the
findings
of
the
facts
that
referred
to
in
our
brief
and
there
was
no
violation
of
any
fiduciary
relationship.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
the
district
court
found
there
had
been
no
use
or
disclosure
of
the
trade
secrets.
it’s
the
findings
that
are
referred
to
in
about
the
third
page
of
our
brief.
and
in
the
transcript,
we’ve
cited
you
to
the
record
on
that.
there
wasn’t
any.
our
people
didn’t
do
anything
wrong.
that’s
the
reason
they’re
so
concerned.
they
tried
to
go
out
and
start
their
own
business
and
they
say,
“it
is
a
free
country,
isn’t
it?”
and
they
didn’t
do
anything
wrong
and
they
are
put
under
an
injunction
and
the
injunction
is
a
severe
handicap
on
their
--
that
they’re
trying
to
raise
money.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
they
didn’t
break
a
contract.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
no!
they
didn’t
break
any
contract.
they
hadn’t
done
anything
wrong.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes,
they
did.
they
made
no
disclosure.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
they
came
up
with
it
from
the
--
first
the
--
there’s
nothing
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
no
they
didn’t.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
they
are
expired
patents.
all
their
publications
of
government
research
laboratories
and
incidentally
the
government
paid
harshaw
a
million
dollars
to
devel
--
i
don’t
know
exactly
how
much,
but
a
lot
of
money
to
develop
these
secrets.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i’d
have
to
answer,
certainly
they
used
what
they
learned
at
the
other
company,
but
it
doesn’t
mean
that
they
were
trade
secrets.
there
--
they
didn’t
use
anything
at
the
other
company
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
not
that
were
secrets
your
honor,
no.
not
that
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
they
couldn’t
have
helped,
but
apply
the
knowledge
they
learned
at
harshaw.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
right,
certainly
but
all
i
say
your
honor
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
no!
they
didn’t.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
because
the
contract
says
they
can’t
disclose
confidential
or
secret
information.
it
doesn’t
say
they
can’t
use
what
they
learned
there
that
it
--
other
than
confidential
and
secret
information.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
there
are
actually
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
your
honor,
at
page
1410
of
the
transcript
in
the
district
court,
the
harshaw
men
finally
admitted
in
response
to
questions
of
the
judge
that,
and
this
is
in
our
--
it's
cited
in
our
brief
too,
that
there
is
no
magic
in
the
trade
secrets
in
17
inches.
they
said
there
are
secrets
applied
on
different
sizes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
guess
he
did.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes
he
did.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
correct,
we
say
none
of
them
were
trade
secrets.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
in
what
respect,
your
honor?
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
correct.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
correct.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
was
speaking
generically
as
to
the
relief.
the
point
i’m
trying
to
make
when
i
speak
of
suit
for
damages
is
that
we’re
not
seeking
to
outlaw
all
these
technical
service
agreements
between
various
companies
and
so
forth.
in
this
case,
no,
there
shouldn’t
be
a
suit
for
damages
because
there
was
no
violations
found.
the
instructions
of
the
court
of
appeals
are
to
reverse
and
dismiss
the
complaint.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes,
sir
that
is.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
it's
--
there
is
--
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
he
signed
it
with
a
different
company,
but
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
it
was
the
--
it
was
not
with
kewanee,
it
was
with
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
with
kewanee
and
the
reason
that
hamner
left
kewanee
is
because
they
had
a
contract
with
them
to
keep
him
employed
until
1974,
and
they
dissolved
the
company
to
avoid
the
contract.
so
he
left
them
and
started
another
business.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
my
position
on
that
your
honor,
is
no.
i
don’t
think
it’s
appropriate
to
give
any
injunctive
relief
under
a
trade
secret
contract
because
you’re
enjoining
somebody
from
doing
something
that
at
that
point
is
supposedly
in
the
public
domain.
i’ll
go
back
to
that
american
gauge
case
of
the
sixth
circuit
in
these
other
cases
to
the
same
event.
the
--
i
was
started
with
sears-compco
the
other
case
we
do
rely
upon
is
goldstein.
we’ve
discussed
that
in
our
brief.
and
i
don’t
think
there's
a
--
and
i’ve
read
what
i
feel
is
a
relevant
language
there.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
no.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
legally
your
honor,
no,
i
don’t
think
so.
i
think
that
the
--
what
you
said
in
sears-compco
was
that
if
you
have
intellectual
property
and
you
want
to
protect
it
in
--
get
yourself
a
patent,
or
a
trademark,
or
a
copyright.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
no
your
honor,
but
the
concept
of
the
lamp
case
was
that
there
was
a
design
patent
involved
there,
i
believe
and
the
illinois,
i
mean
the
courts
in
illinois
said,
“that’s
an
invalid
patent.”
so
therefore,
there
was
no
protection
under
the
patent
laws.
but
then
the
court
turned
around
and
said,
“but
we’ll
give
protection
under
illinois
unfair
competition
laws.”
and
i
would
go
back
to
the
language
i
quoted
from
your
goldstein
decision,
and
that
--
and
i
am
saying
that
the
supreme
courts
--
and
the
congress
has
said,
“this
is
a
patentable
subject
matter
and
anything
that’s
outside
that,
in
the
number
(ph)
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
that
people
can
use.”
your
honor,
i
see
my
time
is
up.
i
do
--
i
--
may
i
read
very
briefly
this
patent
fee
borne
language
in
that
case
where
a
decision
was
a
--
it’s
relied
upon
substantially
by
the
petitioner.
i
want
to
talk
--
say
that
about
two
thirds
down
on
the
second
column
at
page
225,
the
court
clearly
cuts
itself
out
from
the
injunction
concept
that
we’re
discussing
now.
the
--
this
is
the
majority
opinion,
the
decision
there,
it
says,
“provisions
against
competition
not
utilizing
the
secret
after
expiration
of
agreement
are
a
different
matter
which
must
be
judged
on
their
own
facts.”
and
i
think
that’s
the
case
we’re
at.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court,
pardon
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
permit
me
to
begin
by
reference
to
the
specific,
precise
injunction
that’s
before
the
court
and
that
appears
at
page
92
to
94
of
the
appendix
and
this
is
a
permanent
injunction
in
the
part
--
the
only
aspect
of
it
that
is
not
permanent,
is
paragraph
d
where
it
says,
“it
is
ordered
that
defendants,
bicron
and
the
individual
respondents
shall
not
be
restrained
by
this
injunction
from
using
any
trade
secret
of
plaintiff
after
it
has
been
released
to
the
public
by
plaintiff,
such
as
by
the
issuance
of
a
patent
or
as
otherwise
become
generally
available
to
the
public,
or
other
members
of
the
industry,
or
is
obtained
by
defendants
from
sources
having
a
legal
right
to
convey
such
information.”
and
i
also
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
title
of
this
injunction
that
says,
“order
for
permanent
injunction.”
now,
the
--
there
was
no
award
of
damages
by
the
district
court
and
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
to
reverse
the
district
court
and
remand
for
a
dismissal
of
the
complaint.
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
appears
at
page
26
of
the
petitioner’s
--
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
their
writ
of
certiorari.
now,
still
going
to
the
--
if
i
may,
your
honors,
refer
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
it’s
at
page
a7
of
the
certiorari
petition
where
the
sixth
circuit
characterized
the
issue
that
it
felt
was
in
front
of
them.
and
the
sixth
circuit
said,
“therefore,
the
issue
presented
to
this
court
in
the
instant
case
maybe
summarized
as
follows.
whether
a
state
trade
secret
law
which
protects
an
invention
which
would
be
an
appropriate
subject
for
a
patent
under
the
patent
laws
of
the
united
states
and
which
has
been
used
commercially
for
more
than
one
year
conflicts
with
the
policies
and
purposes
of
article
1,
section
8,
clause
8
of
the
constitution
and
the
patent
laws
adopted
pursuant
thereto.”
now,
this
is
the
last
thing
i’ll
read.
if
i
may
go
back
to
page
6
of
the
appendix
also
in
the
same
sixth
circuit
opinion,
the
--
this
is
setting
up
their
question,
the
sixth
circuit
says,
“we
must
determine
whether
the
trade
secret
laws
of
the
state
of
ohio
are
required
to
be
struck
down
in
this
case
as
being
in
conflict
with
the
united
states
patent
laws,
and
if
so,
to
what
extent?”
kewanee
urges
that
the
issue
presented
to
this
court
requires
a
determination
as
to
whether
the
enforcement
of
any
and
all
state
trade
secret
laws
conflict
with
the
policy
of
the
united
states
patent
laws.
thus
framed,
we
consider
the
issue
too
broad
for
our
consideration
in
this
case.
now,
as
we
have
set
out
in
our
brief,
we
say
the
issue
is
a
permanent
injunction
granted
by
a
district
court
as
to
subject
matter,
the
trade
secret
subject
matter,
in
conflict
with
the
patent
laws
of
the
united
states.
if
the
specific
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes,
that
is
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
yes
i
was
coming
to
that,
but
the
thing
is
we
don’t
think
that
coca
cola
is
--
that’s
a
trade
secret
that’s
outside
of
the
scope
of
what
we’re
dealing
with
now.
the
kind
of
trade
secrets
we’re
dealing
with
are
first
trade
secrets
that
are
patentable
subject
matter
as
provided
in
the
patent
code
35
u.s.c
101
and
coca
cola
in
our
view
is
a
food
recipe
and
it
would
not
be
susceptible
of
getting
a
patent.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
would
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
would
--
may
i
suggest
--
i
would
say
that
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
sears,
compco
and
lear
that
if
a
man
applies
for
a
patent
and
its
held
not
patentable
and
it's
been
in
public
use
for
more
than
a
year,
he
could
not
get
an
injunction
to
prohibit
somebody
else
even
if
there
is
a
--
what
is
argued
is
that
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
would
say
it’s
a
conflict,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
want
to
be
careful,
your
honor.
i
say
that
the
aspect
of
the
state
trade
secret
law
that
--
that
is
in
front
of
this
court
is
the
injunction
only,
and
i
say
as
to
if
a
man
files
for
a
patent
application
and
it’s
rejected
and
he
can’t
get
a
patent
application,
he
should
not
be
able
to
get
injunctive
relief.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
the
circumstances
in
which
patent
applications
are
filed,
the
number
of
patent
applications,
there’s
no
license
activity
whatsoever.
and
i
think
that
the
idea
there’s
an
election
theory
and
this
is
what
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
correct,
yes
and
actually
the
word
they
used
is
not
secret,
it’s
confidential.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
i
think
your
--
with
all
due
respect
your
honor,
your
--
your
--
i
--
the
patent
office
as
i
understand
it
would
never
disclose
a
patent
application.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
why
sure.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
and
it’s
that
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
you’re
attaching
much
--
too
much
important
to
that
--
importance
to
that
provision.
the
other
people
have
cited.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
alright.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
alright,
may
i
please
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
they’ve
cited
a
number
of
other
statutes.
for
example,
one
corporation
deals
with
the
sec,
it
discloses
its
inner
workings
and
financial
information,
and
the
government
is
forbidden
against
disclosure
of
that
information.
and
there,
they’ve
cited
a
number
of
statutes
here
where
the
idea
is,
in
our
view,
that
when
you
deal
the
government’s
--
if
it’s
important
to
the
person
making
a
submission
the
government
says,
“we
will
keep
that
confidential,
we’ll
not
disclose
it.”
now
the
government
isn’t
in
the
patent
statutes
or
the
scc
statues
or
anything
else,
they’re
not
saying,
“we
thereby
put
an
imprimatur
on
this
sort
of
relief
that’s
provided
--
that
was
provided
in
district
court
in
this
case.”
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
that’s
the
practice,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
certainly
yes,
i
see
no
problem
with
it.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
think
the
real
purpose
is
to
let
a
man
with
an
invention
deal
with
the
patent
office
in
confidence
in
knowing
that
he
has
an
invention
and
he
thinks
it’s
a
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
i
think
it’s
the
same
rationale.
the
man
has
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
they
--
it
isn’t
saying
it
will
keep
the
dis
--
it
--
what
they
say
is,
“we’ll
not
disclose
what
you’ve
disclosed
to
us.”
so
the
man
feels
free
to
disclose
an
invention.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
think
the
purpose
is
to
make
people
feel
free
to
deal
with
the
u.s.
patent
office.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
you
mean
by
an
individual
against
the
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
suppose
they
would.
i’m
not
aware
of
anybody
has
done
that.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
no,
i’m
not
saying
that
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
correct.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
no
he
couldn’t.
i
don’t
think
he
should
be
able
to
do
that
either.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
think
the
relief
of
--
in
the
court
of
equity
should
be,
in
that
situation
against
disclosure
of
the
trade
secret
because
there
they're
assuming
it’s
not
disclosed
in
the
product
that
they’re
selling.
as
far
as
the
use
is
concerned
that
is
--
it
can
always
be
measured
by
a
reasonable
royalties.
the
idea
of
a
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
they
have
the
same
concept
with
respect
to
trade
secrets
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i’m
saying
that
if
three
examiners
in
the
patent
office
taking
your
example,
leave
the
patent
office
and
--
and
there’s
been
a
disclosure
in
confidence
to
them
and
they
then
setup
and
start
abusing
the
disclosure
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes,
i
say
that
they
should
be
enjoined
against
any
further
disclosure
of
their
--
of
the
secrets,
assuming
it’s
not
disclosed
when
they
use
it.
in
other
words,
if
the
irreparable
harm
has
not
been
done,
then
they
should
be
enjoined
from
doing
it.
as
for
use,
i
would
say
that
you
can
always
measure
the
damages
by
the
use,
by
in
effect
the
same
rules
that
you
apply
in
a
patent
royalty
accounting.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
i’m
not
sure
what
case
you’re
talking
about
your
honor
that
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
--
the
case
right
in
front
of
you?
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
there’s
been
no
use
of
the
invention
in
this
case.
our
people
haven’t
used
these
secrets
at
all
and
i
say
that
there
--
that
the
--
and
there
is
no
real
threat
of
disclosure.
so
i
say
there
should
be
no
injunction
whatsoever.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
i’d
say
if
our
people
use
it
in
production
and
abuse
a
confidence,
then
there
should
be
damage
relief,
but
there
should
not
be
any
injunctive
relief
because
when
they
give
injunctive
relief,
you’re
enjoining
somebody
from
doing
something
where
the
kewanee
people
rejected
the
idea
of
federal
patent
protection.
they
could
not
get
a
patent
--
they
couldn’t
get
a
patent
injunction.
they’re
getting
better
relief
under
the
state
trade
secret
laws
than
they
could
get
under
the
patent
laws
and
that’s
where
i
say
there’s
a
conflict.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
by
the
nature
of
the
amici
brief
that
seems
to
be
the
case,
yes.
there
seems
to
be
a
flight
from
the
patent
system
over
to
a
trade
secret
system.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
no.
but
that
is
sort
of
--
that’s
in
a
way
an
illusionary
argument.
the
relief
that
you
want
in
this
case,
there
are
three
u.s.
companies
--
three
u.s.
competitors
of
kewanee,
bicron
is
the
fourth.
now
there
--
assuming
they
had
a
patent,
there
are
only
four
people
they’ve
even
considered
silly.
what
i’m
saying
is
that
i
don’t
say
that
it’s
equivalent
to
a
patent
monopoly,
but
for
practical
purposes,
it’s
very
close
to
it.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
no
question
about
it.
if
i
may
go
back
to
mr.
justice
white’s
--
your
other
question
was
the
man
who
gets
the
abandoned
patent
is
rejected,
there
is
a
sixth
circuit
case
of
american
gauge
versus
maasdam,
245
f2d
62,
where
an
individual
made
a
contract
with
a
corporation
for
the
manufacture
of
the
wire
stretcher
for
fences,
and
a
patent
application
was
filed
and
the
patent
application
was
rejected.
and
the
individual
received
royalties
for
a
period
of
time
and
then
he
did
not
advise
the
corporation
that
the
patent
application
had
been
rejected,
and
then
the
corporation
terminated
his
contract,
and
the
corporation
continued
to
sell
stretchers.
so
the
individual
sued
for
unjust
enrichment
and
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
the
individual
had
the
right
along
with
the
rest
of
the
world
to
produce
and
sell
wire
stretchers.
and
they
cited
singer
v.
june,
kellogg,
west
point
that
series
of
cases
which
are
cited
in
sears,
compco.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well
i
think
it
helps
me
on
the
idea
that
if
a
person
submits
an
idea
to
the
patent
office,
and
the
patent
office
says
that
it’s
not
patentable
subject
matter,
then
that
--
he
should
not
be
enjoined
from
doing
that
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
it
was
disclosed
in
secrecy
to
the
corporation,
and
it
was
in
a
factory,
i
think
it
certainly
was
secret,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well
it
would
be
publicly
used
in
accordance
with
the
patent
laws,
yes
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
that’s
correct.
the
patent
office
said
we
--
said
--
the
patent
office
considered
the
development,
and
said
it
doesn’t
rise,
it’s
not
a
patentable
subject
matter.
so
if
the
sixth
circuit
had
granted
an
injunction
the
effect
would
be
to
give
injunctive
relief
under
state
trade
secret
laws
where
there
would
be
no
such
relief
under
the
patent
statutes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
don’t
know
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
there
probably
be
an
implied
contract
to
that
effect.
but
i
don’t
know
whether
--
i
don’t
know
the
nature
of
the
contract.
i’d
like
to
pick
up
where
general
griswold
was
talking
about
the
subject
matter
of
--
that’s
before
the
court,
and
by
that
i
mean
the
sodium
iodide
thallium
activated
crystals.
that
they
are
used
in
--
that
this
is
a
subject
matter
which
is
very
vital
to
this
country
at
this
point
in
time.
it’s
detecting
malignant
tumors
in
medicine.
it’s
used
in
oil
exploration.
it’s
used
in
the
location
of
uranium
oil.
this
is
a
substance,
and
i
of
course
enjoining
a
parallel
with
the
subject
matter
in
goldstein
which
depending
upon
you
age
group,
is
or
is
not
substance.
now,
the
specific
trade
secrets
involved
in
this
case
are
set
out
in
volume
1
of
the
appendix
in
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
pages
108
to
110,
in
case
you
want
to
look
at
them.
the
point
i
want
to
make
there
is
that
those
trade
secrets
are
not
described
in
the
way
a
patent
is
described,
they’re
merely
identified.
you
just
look
at
it
it’s
just
a
1
or
2
or
3
line,
that’s
all.
now
the
cases
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
okay.
[luncheon
recess]
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court?
i’d
like
to
pick
up
on
this
matter
of
the
section
122
of
the
patent
statute.
i
have
two
very
brief
points.
the
first
one
is,
that
in
our
view
the
purpose
of
that
statute
is
no
different
than
any
of
the
other
statutes
that
have
been
cited
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner,
and
secondly
that
if
somebody
violates
anyone
of
those
statutes
a
relief
is
provided
at
--
in
section
19
u.s.c.,
1905,
it's
page
1
(a)
of
the
petitioner’s
appendix.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
you
file
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes,
it
would
--
but
it
would
include
other
kinds
too.
it
would
include
an
application
where
it’s
been
denied
and
you
determine
that
--
you
don’t
think
you’re
going
to
get
good
enough
protection
so
you
don’t
press
it,
i
mean
it’s
a
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
the
cases
we
rely
upon
and
that
the
sixth
circuit
relied
upon
where
the
sears,
compco
&
lear
in
a
nutshell,
we
read
those
cases
to
hold
three
things.
first,
that
there
is
a
strong
federal
policy
favoring
the
full
and
free
use
of
ideas
in
the
public
domain.
secondly,
that
the
public
domain
is
anything
which
is
not
protected
by
a
patent
copyright
or
trademark.
that
concept
is
developed
in
our
brief,
but
i
think
that’s
a
fair
definition
of
the
public
domain,
and
if
i
may,
i
believe
it’s
discussed
in
somewhat
different
context
in
the
majority
opinion
in
goldstein.
i’m
not
--
i
don’t
have
the
official
report,
but
where
this
court
said,
“in
regard
to
mechanical
configurations,
congress
has
balanced
the
need
to
encourage
innovation
and
originality
of
invention
against
the
need
to
ensure
competition
in
the
sale
of
identical
or
substantially
identical
products.
the
standards
established
for
granting
federal
patent
protection
to
machines,
thus
indicated
not
only
which
articles
in
this
particular
category,
congress
wish
to
protect,
but
which
configurations
it
wish
to
remain
free.
the
application
of
state
law
in
these
cases
to
prevent
the
copying
of
articles
which
did
not
meet
the
requirements
for
a
federal
protection
disturbed
the
careful
balance
which
congress
had
drawn,
and
thereby
necessarily
gave
way
under
the
supremacy
cause
of
the
constitution.”
now,
there
--
i
believe
a
further
development
of
that
concept
is
the
thought
that
this
word
public,
when
you
speak
of
public
domain,
maybe
it’s
a
little
confusing.
i
think
that
the
thrust
of
the
sears,
compco
cases
are
if
you
have
intellectual
property
and
you
wish
to
protect
it,
get
yourself
a
patent,
or
a
copyright
or
a
trademark.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
you
can
protect
yourself
by
a
contract
your
honor,
with
--
like
these
service
agreements.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
i
can’t
say
its
irrelevant,
but
i
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
say
they’re
not
enforceable.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
as
far
as
an
injunction
is
concerned.
i
say
they
can’t
enjoin
them
from
using.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
say
you
can
get
damages
and
the
cases
that
discuss,
there
is
a
dissent
in
a
second
circuit
case.
it’s
franke
v.
wiltschek,
209
f2d
493,
a
dissent
by
a
judge
frank
where
he
made
that
very
point.
he
said,
“you
can’t
get
an
injunction,
you
can
get
damages”.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i’m
afraid
it
isn’t
your
honor,
i
would
know.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
alright,
it’s
franke
v.
wiltschek,
209
f2d
493.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
1953,
second
circuit.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
it's
209
f2d
493.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
my
--
with
respect
to
coca
cola,
i
say
this
your
honor,
that
coca
cola
is
not
patentable
subject
matter.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
my
answer
would
be
there
would
be
a
public
use.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i’d
say
it
is
in
the
public
domain,
too.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
by
the
definition
of
this
court
in
sears,
compco
&
lear.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
the
contract
forbids
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
it
should
not,
correct.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
correct,
and
if
i
may
go
back
your
honor,
the
sixth
circuit
has
had
really
three
cases
before
it
on
trade
secrets.
your
confusion
arises
by
reason
of
the
way
the
petitioner
is
characterizing
this
case.
they’re
saying,
“we’re
trying
to
outlaw
all
trade
secret
agreements,
all
know
how.
we’re
trying
to
upset
the
balance
of
payments”
and
we
say
no.
all
we’re
concerned
with
is
the
narrow
question
of
an
injunction
of
former
employees
in
this
case
where
the
harshaw
chemical
company
dealing
with
subject
matter
of
vital
interest
to
this
country.
these
are
the
sodium
iodide
thallium
activated
crystals.
they
chose
to
avoid
the
patent
system,
where
if
they
had
patented
it,
they
could’ve
gotten
their
injunction.
instead
of
going
through
the
patent
system,
they
said,
“we’re
smarter.
we’ll
stay
out
of
it”
and
suddenly
a
situation
arose
and
then
they
come
in,
and
they
wanted
to
get
and
they
got
a
permanent
injunction
which
is
better
than
any
relief
they
could’ve
gotten
in
the
patent
system.
and
we
say
that
is
a
--
there
is
a
--
they’re
defeating
the
purposes
of
the
patent
system
and
that
isn’t
correct.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
with
all
due
[attempt
to
laughter]
respect
further
language
of
the
court
of
appeals
came
from
about
that.
i
don’t
know
if
their
--
the
findings
of
the
facts
that
referred
to
in
our
brief
and
there
was
no
violation
of
any
fiduciary
relationship.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
the
district
court
found
there
had
been
no
use
or
disclosure
of
the
trade
secrets.
it’s
the
findings
that
are
referred
to
in
about
the
third
page
of
our
brief.
and
in
the
transcript,
we’ve
cited
you
to
the
record
on
that.
there
wasn’t
any.
our
people
didn’t
do
anything
wrong.
that’s
the
reason
they’re
so
concerned.
they
tried
to
go
out
and
start
their
own
business
and
they
say,
“it
is
a
free
country,
isn’t
it?”
and
they
didn’t
do
anything
wrong
and
they
are
put
under
an
injunction
and
the
injunction
is
a
severe
handicap
on
their
--
that
they’re
trying
to
raise
money.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
they
didn’t
break
a
contract.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
no!
they
didn’t
break
any
contract.
they
hadn’t
done
anything
wrong.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes,
they
did.
they
made
no
disclosure.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
they
came
up
with
it
from
the
--
first
the
--
there’s
nothing
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
no
they
didn’t.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
they
are
expired
patents.
all
their
publications
of
government
research
laboratories
and
incidentally
the
government
paid
harshaw
a
million
dollars
to
devel
--
i
don’t
know
exactly
how
much,
but
a
lot
of
money
to
develop
these
secrets.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i’d
have
to
answer,
certainly
they
used
what
they
learned
at
the
other
company,
but
it
doesn’t
mean
that
they
were
trade
secrets.
there
--
they
didn’t
use
anything
at
the
other
company
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
not
that
were
secrets
your
honor,
no.
not
that
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
they
couldn’t
have
helped,
but
apply
the
knowledge
they
learned
at
harshaw.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
right,
certainly
but
all
i
say
your
honor
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
no!
they
didn’t.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
because
the
contract
says
they
can’t
disclose
confidential
or
secret
information.
it
doesn’t
say
they
can’t
use
what
they
learned
there
that
it
--
other
than
confidential
and
secret
information.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
there
are
actually
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
your
honor,
at
page
1410
of
the
transcript
in
the
district
court,
the
harshaw
men
finally
admitted
in
response
to
questions
of
the
judge
that,
and
this
is
in
our
--
it's
cited
in
our
brief
too,
that
there
is
no
magic
in
the
trade
secrets
in
17
inches.
they
said
there
are
secrets
applied
on
different
sizes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
i
guess
he
did.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes
he
did.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
correct,
we
say
none
of
them
were
trade
secrets.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
in
what
respect,
your
honor?
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
correct.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
correct.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
was
speaking
generically
as
to
the
relief.
the
point
i’m
trying
to
make
when
i
speak
of
suit
for
damages
is
that
we’re
not
seeking
to
outlaw
all
these
technical
service
agreements
between
various
companies
and
so
forth.
in
this
case,
no,
there
shouldn’t
be
a
suit
for
damages
because
there
was
no
violations
found.
the
instructions
of
the
court
of
appeals
are
to
reverse
and
dismiss
the
complaint.
(voice
overlap)
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes,
sir
that
is.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
it's
--
there
is
--
yes.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
he
signed
it
with
a
different
company,
but
--
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
it
was
the
--
it
was
not
with
kewanee,
it
was
with
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
with
kewanee
and
the
reason
that
hamner
left
kewanee
is
because
they
had
a
contract
with
them
to
keep
him
employed
until
1974,
and
they
dissolved
the
company
to
avoid
the
contract.
so
he
left
them
and
started
another
business.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
yes
sir,
it
is
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
my
position
on
that
your
honor,
is
no.
i
don’t
think
it’s
appropriate
to
give
any
injunctive
relief
under
a
trade
secret
contract
because
you’re
enjoining
somebody
from
doing
something
that
at
that
point
is
supposedly
in
the
public
domain.
i’ll
go
back
to
that
american
gauge
case
of
the
sixth
circuit
in
these
other
cases
to
the
same
event.
the
--
i
was
started
with
sears-compco
the
other
case
we
do
rely
upon
is
goldstein.
we’ve
discussed
that
in
our
brief.
and
i
don’t
think
there's
a
--
and
i’ve
read
what
i
feel
is
a
relevant
language
there.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
no.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
legally
your
honor,
no,
i
don’t
think
so.
i
think
that
the
--
what
you
said
in
sears-compco
was
that
if
you
have
intellectual
property
and
you
want
to
protect
it
in
--
get
yourself
a
patent,
or
a
trademark,
or
a
copyright.
mr.
william
c.
mccoy,
jr.
well,
no
your
honor,
but
the
concept
of
the
lamp
case
was
that
there
was
a
design
patent
involved
there,
i
believe
and
the
illinois,
i
mean
the
courts
in
illinois
said,
“that’s
an
invalid
patent.”
so
therefore,
there
was
no
protection
under
the
patent
laws.
but
then
the
court
turned
around
and
said,
“but
we’ll
give
protection
under
illinois
unfair
competition
laws.”
and
i
would
go
back
to
the
language
i
quoted
from
your
goldstein
decision,
and
that
--
and
i
am
saying
that
the
supreme
courts
--
and
the
congress
has
said,
“this
is
a
patentable
subject
matter
and
anything
that’s
outside
that,
in
the
number
(ph)
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
that
people
can
use.”
your
honor,
i
see
my
time
is
up.
i
do
--
i
--
may
i
read
very
briefly
this
patent
fee
borne
language
in
that
case
where
a
decision
was
a
--
it’s
relied
upon
substantially
by
the
petitioner.
i
want
to
talk
--
say
that
about
two
thirds
down
on
the
second
column
at
page
225,
the
court
clearly
cuts
itself
out
from
the
injunction
concept
that
we’re
discussing
now.
the
--
this
is
the
majority
opinion,
the
decision
there,
it
says,
“provisions
against
competition
not
utilizing
the
secret
after
expiration
of
agreement
are
a
different
matter
which
must
be
judged
on
their
own
facts.”
and
i
think
that’s
the
case
we’re
at.
