mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
that
court
by
a
divided
vote,
held
that
the
ohio
law
of
trade
secrets
was
preempted
by
the
federal
patent
laws.
on
this
basis,
it
reversed
a
judgment
which
had
been
entered
by
the
district
court,
following
an
extensive
trial,
which
had
enjoined
the
respondents
here
from
using
and
disclosing
trade
secrets
which
they
had
learned
while
they
were
in
the
employ
of
the
petitioner.
the
facts
are
relatively
simple
as
far
as
the
issue
before
this
court
is
concerned.
they
maybe
said,
i
think
to
present
a
classic
case
of
equity
jurisdiction.
the
petitioner
threw
an
unincorporated
division
called
harshaw,
and
manufactures
various
products
in
the
chemical
field.
these
include
synthetic
crystals
and
the
particular
product
involved
here
is
sodium
iodide,
thallium
activated
crystals.
that
means
that
it
is
basically
sodium
iodide,
but
by
introducing
some
thallium
in
it,
the
crystal
becomes
effective
in
detecting
radiation.
and
these
crystals
are
useful
in
locating
uranium
ore
and
oil
exploration,
and
through
various
medical
purposes
such
as
detecting
malignant
tumors.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i’m
sorry,
i
--
apparently
i
am
wrong.
my
recollection
was
it
was
a
divided
vote,
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
was
unanimous.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
now
say
they
were
unanimously
wrong.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
harshaw
was
a
pioneer
in
this
field
and
has
been
actively
developing
it
for
25
years.
in
1949,
it
grew
a
sodium
iodide
thallium
activated
crystal,
less
than
two
inches
in
diameter.
by
1966,
after
the
investment
of
much
money
and
effort,
it
was
able
to
grow
a
crystal
17
inches
in
diameter.
and
i
may
say
that
these
crystals
are
grown
in
--
in
platinum
crucibles
that
comes
out
a
very
substantial
mass.
it
is
then
sliced
which
is
a
very
delicate
operation.
it
must
be
quickly
encapsulated
because
it
is
heavily
hydroscopic,
it
will
absorb
moisture.
when
it
absorbs
moisture
it
melts.
this
is
full
of
delicate
operations
and
the
size
of
the
crystal
is
significant
among
other
things
because
that
a
17
inch
crystal
will
more
or
less
cover
the
chest
of
a
person
who
is
being
examined,
whereas
the
smaller
crystals,
you’d
have
to
use
many
and
you
might
miss
places.
worldwide,
there
are
several
companies
that
compete
with
harshaw
in
this
business.
there
are
three
in
the
united
states
other
than
the
respondent,
two
in
japan
and
one
each
in
great
britain
and
france.
up
to
date
however,
no
company
has
grown
or
sold
a
17
inch
diameter
crystal
except
harshaw.
in
producing
such
a
crystal,
harshaw
developed
many
confidential
processes,
procedures
and
techniques
which
it
claims
as
trade
secrets.
there
are
six
individual
defendants,
each
of
them
was
employed
by
harshaw
or
by
a
subsidiary
of
harshaw.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
no
patent
involved
here.
no
claim
is
made
based
on
a
patent.
each
entered
into
a
contract
with
his
employer
that
he
would
not
disclose
the
confidential
information
of
harshaw.
each
of
these
employees
occupied
a
position
of
trust
and
confidence
with
harshaw
and
was
given
access
to
the
secret
operations
in
connection
with
his
employment.
thus,
each
of
the
individual
respondents
was
bound
by
contract
and
by
fiduciary
relationship
resulting
from
his
confidential
employment,
not
to
disclose
harshaw’s
confidential
information.
it’s
one
of
the
traditional
functions
of
equity
to
enforce
such
obligations.
while
still
employed
by
harshaw,
four
of
the
individual
respondents
discussed
the
possibility
of
forming
their
own
business.
in
order
to
have
a
going
business
in
the
shortest
period
of
time,
they
decided
to
make
scintillation
detectors
using
sodium
iodide
thallium
activated
crystals.
during
the
summer
and
fall
of
1969,
they
associated
the
other
individual
respondents
to
them
who
had
recently
left
harshaw’s
employ.
they
built
a
plant
which
was
completed
in
late
1969
or
early
1970
and
soon
had
produced
a
17
inch
sodium
iodide
thallium
activated
scintillation
crystal.
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
imminent
danger
of
disclosure
of
plaintiff’s
trade
secrets
to
bicron
which
was
the
company
they
organized,
and
the
use
of
these
trade
secrets
by
bicron.
in
april
1970,
kewanee
filed
this
suit
to
enjoin
the
individual
defendants
in
bicron
from
using
and
disclosing
kewanee’s
trade
secrets.
there
was
an
extensive
trial.
the
district
court
found
that
kewanee
had
a
protectable
interest
in
20
of
the
40
trade
secrets
on
which
it
relied.
it
held
that
the
other
20
were
common
knowledge
and
could
be
freely
used.
accordingly,
it
entered
in
a
judgment
enjoining
bicron
and
the
individual
respondents
from
disclosing
and
using
the
20
trade
secrets
unless
and
until
they
became
validly,
publicly
known.
both
sides
appealed
from
this
decision.
kewanee
contended
that
all
40
trade
secrets
should
have
been
protected,
while
bircron
cross-appealed
claiming
that
none
of
the
trade
secrets
should
be
protected.
and
the
court
of
appeals
after
reviewing
the
record
held
that
the
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
district
court
were
not
clearly
erroneous
within
the
meaning
of
rule
52
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
court
further
concluded
that
the
district
court
properly
applied
the
ohio
law
relating
to
trade
secrets,
and
then
it
said
and
i
quote
from
the
opinion
as
it
is
set
out
on
page
16
of
our
brief,
“on
this
record
as
a
whole,
it
appears
clear
to
us
as
it
did
to
the
district
court,
that
the
individual
defendants
used
the
information
obtained
during
their
employment
by
harshaw
for
the
benefit
of
bicron.
there
can
be
no
question
on
this
record,
but
what
these
individual
defendants
appropriated
to
the
benefit
of
bicron,
harshaw’s
secrets,
processes,
procedures
and
manufacturing
techniques.”
and
the
court
of
appeals
then
concluded
that
it
would
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
except
for
the
conclusion
that
it
reached,
that
the
ohio
law
trade
secrets
is
in
direct
conflict
with
the
patent
laws
of
the
united
states.
that
is
that
the
law
of
trade
secrets
is
preempted
by
the
patent
laws,
and
on
this
basis
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
order
of
the
district
court
which
had
entered
an
injunction
against
respondents,
and
that
is
the
issue
which
he
has
--
been
brought
here.
now,
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
the
ohio
law
relating
to
trade
secrets.
it’s
similar
to
the
law
which
has
been
long
effect
in
most
of
the
states
and
which
is
derived
from
english
sources
going
back
over
a
century.
it
is
indeed
simply
an
application
of
the
traditional
equity
principle,
where
dealing
with
threatened
breach
of
contract,
or
violations
of
fiduciary
obligation.
obviously,
the
value
of
a
trade
secret
depends
upon
as
being
kept
secret.
this
does
not
mean
that
it
cannot
be
disclosed
in
confidence
or
with
suitable
safeguards
as
a
means
of
utilizing
the
secret.
but
unless
the
safeguards
can
be
enforced,
that
is
the
safeguards
arising
out
of
contract
or
out
of
fiduciary
relationship.
the
secret
will
soon
no
longer
be
a
secret
and
accordingly
will
have
no
value.
a
trade
secret
is
not
the
equivalent
of
a
patent.
a
patent
when
valid,
gives
a
right
reaching
to
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states,
effective
against
every
person
in
the
united
states.
it
is
a
true
governmental
grant
of
a
monopoly.
when
a
patent
is
granted,
there
is
disclosure
to
the
public,
but
no
one
may
utilize
the
device
of
process
without
license
for
a
period
of
17
years.
this
is
true
even
as
to
a
person
who
has
independently
dis
--
conceived
the
same
idea.
it’s
true
as
to
everyone
within
the
outer
limits
of
the
united
states.
it’s
a
true
monopoly.
but
a
trade
secret
is
much
more
limited.
it
finds
its
substance
as
i
have
indicated
in
ordinary
principles
of
equity.
it’s
enforced
against
persons
only
who
have
one
way
or
another,
undertaken
an
obligation
not
to
disclose.
it
may
be
enforced
too
against
persons
who
obtain
the
secret
wrongfully
as
by
bribery
or
by
burglary,
as
to
all
the
world
though,
other
than
those
who
are
bound
by
contract
or
by
fiduciary
duty,
the
trade
secret
maybe
utilized
by
anyone
who
obtains
it
without
wrongdoing.
thus,
it
maybe
uncovered
by
inspection
by
what
is
called
reverse
engineering.
you
take
the
thing
that
you
have
and
a
trained
engineer
works
back
to
see
how
it
was
put
together
or
by
trial
and
error.
it
may
also
be
developed
by
anyone
who
carries
on
the
same
steps
of
research
and
development
which
were
utilized
by
the
original
developer
of
the
trade
secret.
in
this
particular
case,
the
record
shows
that
there
are
a
number
of
competitors
who
are
in
no
way
bound
by
contract
or
by
fiduciary
obligation,
and
all
of
them
are
free
to
develop
the
same
trade
secrets
if
they
can.
now,
this
would
not
be
true
with
respect
to
a
patent
which
binds
all
others
no
matter
how
independent
or
original
their
activities
may
be.
now,
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
state
law
of
trade
secrets
long
in
effect
and
prevalent
throughout
the
united
states,
has
in
some
way
been
preempted
by
the
patent
laws.
it’s
true
of
course
that
congress
has
been
given
power
to
grant
patents.
historically
the
states
granted
patents
in
the
early
days,
but
i
don’t
believe
they
do
now.
it
may
well
be
true
that
congress
could
under
the
necessary
and
proper
law
--
clause
preempt
the
state
law
of
trade
secrets.
just
as
i
suppose
if
congress
could
preempt
the
copyright
field,
so
as
to
invalidate
all
state
legislation
in
that
area.
but
last
term
in
goldstein
against
california,
this
court
refused
to
find
such
an
effect
in
the
constitutional
provision
which
is
identical
with
respect
to
copyrights
and
patents,
and
refused
to
find
it
as
to
a
matter
not
covered
by
the
patent
law
as
enacted
by
--
by
the
copyright
law
as
enacted
by
congress.
and
we
submit
that
the
same
conclusion
should
be
reached
here
with
respect
to
the
impact
of
the
patent
laws
on
the
state
law
of
trade
secrets.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no!
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
there
is
a
--
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
your
position
was
that
because
of
the
constitutional
clause,
no
state
or
--
no
state
can
enact
either
a
patent
or
a
copyright
law,
then
i
think
it
would
follow
that
a
state
could
not
act
--
enact
a
patent
law
just
as
it
was
your
position
that
they
could
not
enact
a
copyright
law.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
our
position
would
be
exactly
the
same.
our
position
is
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
trade
secret
which
we
are
seeking
to
enforce
through
ordinary
equitable
principles
which
is
in
no
way
inconsistent
with
a
patent
and
is
not
a
functional
equivalent
of
a
patent.
although
of
course
it
is
in
--
has
a
related
--
it
is
in
a
related
field
dealing
with
what
might
be
broadly
called
industrial
property.
there
is
nothing
in
the
patent
law
which
expressly
requires
preemption.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
state
trade
secret
law
has
coexisted
with
the
patent
law
in
this
country
for
more
than
a
century
without
interfering
with
anything
that
congress
has
written
in
the
patent
law.
trade
secrets
have
been
clearly
established
in
ohio
at
least
since
the
decision
of
then
superior
court
judge
taft
in
the
case
of
cincinnati
bell
foundry
against
dodds,
decided
in
1887.
this
court
has
many
times
recognized
the
existence
and
validity
of
trade
secrets
in
its
decisions.
we
have
cited
several
of
these
cases
in
our
brief
and
many
more
are
cited
in
the
numerous
amicus
briefs
which
have
been
filed
here.
in
the
dubilier
condenser
case,
this
court
said
that
the
inventor
and
i
quote,
“may
keep
his
invention
secret”
and
that
didn’t
mean
just
keep
it
to
himself
because
it
went
on
to
say,
“and
reap
its
fruits
indefinitely.”
these
decisions
were
outstanding
and
unqualified
when
the
patent
law
was
completely
overhauled
by
congress
in
1952.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
which
indicates
any
disapproval
by
congress
of
the
continuing
validity
of
the
law
of
trade
secrets.
moreover,
this
court
recognized
the
validity
of
trade
secrets
in
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
were
adopted
in
1938.
and
congress
has
both
before
and
since
1952,
enacted
many
statutes
which
recognized
the
continuing
validity
of
the
state
law
of
trade
secrets,
these
statutes
both
before
and
after
1952
are
cited
in
appendices
b
and
c
of
our
brief.
the
issue
which
we
see
here
i
think
can
be
put
in
this
way,
congress
could
no
doubt
by
its
action
preempt
the
state
law
of
trade
secrets.
congress
has
taken
no
such
action.
the
pressure
in
that
direction
comes
from
several
decisions
of
this
court
all
dealing
with
other
factual
situations
and
not
involving
trade
secrets.
in
this
connection,
i
would
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
an
article
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
by
professor
widick
of
the
university
of
california
at
davis.
when
we
cited
it
we
had
it
only
in
manuscript,
but
i
am
now
advised
that
it
has
been
published
in
the
december
1973
issue
of
the
journal
of
the
patent
office
society,
55
journal
of
the
patent
office
society,
736.
that
issue
publishes
only
the
first
half
of
the
article,
the
second
half
will
be
in
the
january
issue
and
i
will
lodge
copy
of
the
entire
article
with
the
clerk
so
that
it
will
be
available
for
the
court.
now,
it
said
that
the
trade
secrets
in
this
case
are
invalid
because
the
petitioner
has
lost
his
right
to
get
a
patent
on
him.
the
argument
is
based
on
section
102
(b)
of
the
patent
law
which
is
set
out
on
page
3
of
our
brief,
just
above
the
middle
which
reads
that
a
person
shall
be
entitled
to
a
patent
'b'
--
patent
unless
'b'
the
invention
was
in
public
use
in
this
country
more
than
one
year
prior
to
the
date
of
the
application
for
patent
in
the
united
states.
what
this
says
is
that
where
the
idea
has
been
in
public
use
for
a
year,
no
patent
may
be
obtained
and
of
course
we
don’t
contest
that.
it
may
well
be
that
harshaw
has
lost
its
right
to
obtain
a
patent
on
any
of
these
trade
secrets.
however,
harshaw
is
not
claiming
under
the
patent
laws.
it
does
not
seek
a
monopoly
against
the
world.
it
seeks
only
to
invoke
the
traditional
function
of
equity
to
provide
protection
against
breach
of
contract
or
violation
of
fiduciary
responsibilities.
some
of
the
arguments
against
us
in
this
respect
seem
to
beg
the
question.
thus,
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
scm
corporation,
it
is
said
on
page
13
that
the
petitioner’s
rights
are
and
i
quote,
“forfeited
to
the
public
by
commercial
use
in
excess
of
one
year,
coupled
with
failure
to
file
a
time;y
patent
application.”
and
there
are
similar
statements
near
the
top
of
pages
18
and
19
and
elsewhere
in
that
brief.
now,
of
course
if
the
petitioner’s
rights
have
been
forfeited,
then
it
has
no
rights
remaining
and
can
get
no
relief
here.
however,
that
is
not
what
the
statute
says
nor
is
there
any
basis
for
reading
the
statute
to
reach
such
a
conclusion.
what
the
statute
says
is
that
a
person
shall
be
entitled
to
a
patent
unless
the
invention
has
been
in
public
use
for
more
than
one
year.
the
only
appropriate
conclusion
from
the
language
is
that
the
right
to
obtain
the
patent
is
gone
after
one
year.
there’s
nothing
in
the
statute
to
support
the
contention
that
the
petitioner
forfeited
to
the
public
under
the
patent
laws
every
right
available
to
it,
including
the
protection
of
long
and
traditionally
made
available
rights,
extended
by
courts
of
equity
against
breach
of
contract
or
violation
of
fiduciary
duty.
the
court
below
and
the
respondents
here
rely
heavily
on
this
court’s
decisions
in
1964
in
sears,
roebuck
and
company
against
stiffel
company
and
compco
corp.
against
day-brite
lighting
company,
both
in
376
u.s.
those
cases
seem
to
us
to
be
clearly
distinguishable.
they
did
not
involve
trade
secrets
nor
did
they
involve
any
threatened
breach
of
contract
or
violation
of
fiduciary
duty.
both
have
some
rather
sweeping
language
applied
to
other
facts,
but
which
may
well
not
be
properly
applicable
on
the
facts
involved
here.
both
of
the
cases
involved
lamps.
in
each
case,
a
design
patent
had
been
obtained
on
the
lamp
and
in
each
case
the
design
patent
had
been
held
invalid.
there
was
of
course
nothing
secret
about
the
lamps.
they
were
sold
to
the
public,
and
they
and
their
design
were
available
for
inspection.
they
could
be
photographed
and
detailed
drawings
could
be
made
of
the
designs.
what
the
illinois
court
did
in
each
case
was
to
hold
that
the
plaintiff
whose
design
patent
had
been
held
invalid
could
nevertheless
obtain
in
mr.
justice
black’s
words
in
the
sears
opinion,
“the
equivalent
of
a
patent
monopoly
on
its
unpatented
lamp.”
it’s
obvious
of
course
that
such
an
injunction
by
the
illinois
court
was
the
function,
only
equivalent
of
a
patent.
it
would
be
effective
against
anybody
who
sought
to
make
the
lamp.
the
relief
obtained
was
as
wide
and
as
broad
as
the
protection
under
a
patent.
it
did
not
depend
in
any
way
on
breach
of
contract
or
violation
of
a
fiduciary
duty.
it
applied
to
anyone
who
sought
to
make
and
market
a
copy
of
the
lamp,
despite
the
fact
that
the
design
patent
had
been
held
invalid.
now
this
court
did
recognize
in
the
opinion
in
the
case
by
mr.
justice
black
that
it
was
not
foreclosing
all
relief.
it
indicated
that
if
there
was
evidence
of
passing
off
that
the
court
could
require
a
labeling
and
otherwise
designating
the
source
of
the
particular
lamp.
but
here
the
respondents
are
not
seeking
to
utilize
material
which
is
known
to
the
public,
or
otherwise
in
the
public
domain.
on
the
contrary,
the
respondents
are
personally
bound
by
contract
and
by
fiduciary
relationship
not
to
disclose
what
has
been
communicated
to
them
in
confidence.
there
is
of
course
an
interrelation
between
the
patent
law
and
the
law
of
trade
secrets.
this
has
been
known
to
the
profession,
to
businessmen,
to
this
court
and
to
congress
for
a
great
many
years.
some
of
the
briefs,
including
particularly
two
of
the
amicus
briefs
present
effects
--
arguments
to
the
effect
that
the
economy
would
be
better
served
by
reducing
the
protection
which
has
long
been
granted
to
trade
secrets.
these
are
arguments
on
which
congress
has
never
acted.
they
are
essentially
legislative
arguments
calling
for
a
change
in
the
law
in
this
area
and
it
has
--
as
it
has
long
been
known
and
understood,
and
as
congress
has
written
it.
in
the
constitutional
field,
it
may
well
be
that
the
court
should
sit
to
some
extent
as
a
continuing
constitutional
convention
bringing
about
changes
in
the
interpretation
of
the
constitution
from
time
to
time,
since
no
one
else
has
power
to
authenticate
the
effect
of
new
developments
and
new
undertakings.
but
there
is
no
reason
for
this
court
to
sit
as
a
continuing
legislative
body.
congress
is
almost
continued
--
continually
in
session
and
it
has
undoubted
power
not
only
to
enact
a
patent
law,
but
also
to
determine
the
impact
of
the
patent
law
on
the
state
law
of
trade
secrets.
many
of
the
arguments
presented
in
support
of
the
decision
below
are
essentially
legislative
arguments
and
should
be
presented
to
congress.
the
fact
is
of
course,
that
congress
has
never
taken
any
explicit
action
which
affects
the
state
law
of
trade
secrets
and
on
the
contrary
it
has
on
many
occasions,
both
before
and
after
the
enactment
of
the
patent
code
of
1952
and
in
the
patent
code
of
1952,
recognized
the
existence
and
continuing
validity
of
trade
secrets
as
they
have
long
existed,
and
under
the
laws
of
the
several
states
pursuant
to
the
traditional
doctrines
of
equity.
for
example,
in
the
patent
code
itself,
congress
provided
that
patent
application
should
be
kept
secret
so
that
if
a
patent
is
eventually
denied,
the
applicant
still
has
whatever
protection
he
is
entitled
to
from
the
trade
secret.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
are
kept
secret
with
certain
exceptions
which
are
specified
in
the
statute
with
a
very
narrow
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
then
it
is
not
made
public
and
the
applicant
continues
to
have
whatever
rights
he
may
have
under
the
law
of
trade
secrets.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
it
is
cited
in
our
brief.
i
will
ask
mr.
springel
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
find
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
finally,
i
would
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
trade
secrets
play
a
major
role
in
the
economy
of
the
united
states,
both
domestic
and
foreign.
many
businesses
have
been
founded
and
conducted
on
the
basis
of
trade
secrets
of
which
the
coca
cola
company
is
perhaps
the
classic
example.
this
is
35
u.s.
code,
section
122
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
it
is
cited
in
a
footnote
on
page
35
of
our
brief.
there
are
similar
provision
in
the
regulations
of
the
patent
office.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that’s
my
understanding.
i
think
it's
part
of
the
folklore,
the
legal
folklore
of
the
country,
i
--
i
might
say.
in
recent
years
much
american
know
how,
and
many
american
processes
and
procedures
had
been
licensed
abroad
and
the
royalties
received
for
these
ideas
have
a
very
substantial
impact
on
our
balance
of
payments.
it
seems
odd
indeed
that
because
of
the
patent
laws
designed
to
protect
american
inventors
and
american
industry,
this
whole
structure
of
industrial
property
which
has
been
widely
and
effectively
utilized,
not
hoarded,
not
suppressed,
should
be
in
danger
of
destruction.
there’s
nothing
in
sears
and
compco,
we
submit,
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
continued
application
of
the
state
law
of
trade
secrets.
the
court
below
misconstrued
and
misapplied
those
decisions
in
reaching
its
conclusion
and
accordingly
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
there
were
six
contracts,
mr.
justice.
there
was
a
contract
with
each
of
the
employees.
the
contract
in
the
case
of
hamner
was
with
a
predecessor
company
which
was
taken
over
by
harshaw.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
had
a
what?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
applied
with
respect
to
successors,
yes
and
hamner
was
in
the
employee
of
harshaw
for
awhile
before
he
left.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
were
contracts
with
all
six.
some
of
them
were
employment
contracts.
some
of
them
were
more
sweeping
trade
secret
contracts.
there
was
not
a
trade
secret
contract
with
everyone,
but
there
was
an
employment
contract
with
everyone,
or
a
trade
secret
contract.
this
is
spelled
out
in
the
findings
that
there
was
a
contract
and
either
contract
is
broad
enough
to
cover
what’s
involved
here.
moreover,
they
were
all
employees
so
that
they
are
all
covered
by
law
of
confidential
employees,
so
that
they
were
all
covered
by
the
fiduciary
relationship.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
this
is
on
page
89
of
the
appendix
and
conclusion
6
of
the
court.
the
plaintiff
has
submitted
convincing
proof
not
only
that
the
richard
formula
will
not
grow
such
a
crystal,
but
also
that
in
order
to
grow
a
sodium
iodide
thallium
activated
scintillation
crystal,
the
defendants
must
of
necessity
supplement
the
richard
formula
with
plaintiff’s
trade
secrets.
the
court
concludes
that
there
is
an
imminent
danger
of
disclosure
of
plaintiff’s
trade
secrets
to
bicron
and
the
use
of
these
trade
secrets
by
bicron.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
would
violate
the
contract
and
the
fiduciary
relationship.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
a
further
answer
to
the
question
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
asked
me
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument.
with
respect
to
the
opinion
of
justice
marshal
which
justices
blackmun
and
brennan
joined
in
the
goldstein
case.
that
did
not
turn
at
all
on
the
constitutional
question.
it
turned
down
the
fact
that
the
statute
involved
there,
that
is
the
federal
copyright
act
uses
the
exact
wording
of
the
constitution,
specifically
the
words
writings
of
an
author.
and
from
that,
those
three
justices
reached
the
conclusion
that
congress
had
occupied
the
field
and
that
there
was
no
room
for
a
state
statute
in
the
area.
there
is
nothing
comparable
to
that
with
respect
to
the
patent
law.
and
then
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question,
i
should
have
been
quicker
in
bringing
to
your
attention
that
the
statute,
the
patent
office
statute
is
printed
in
full
in
our
brief,
title
35,
section
122
is
in
the
appendix
at
page
6
(a).
application
for
patent
shall
be
kept
in
confidence
and
so
on
and
then
on
page
3
(a)
is
the
patent
office
regulation
which
that
statute
puts
into
statutory
language.
pending
patent
applications
are
preserved
in
secrecy.
the
regulation
used
the
word,
though
i
don’t
think
that
there
is
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
what
applications?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
are
not
published,
they
are
kept
in
secret.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
discussed
in
footnote
35,
in
footnote
11
on
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that’s
a
--
there’s
a
good
deal
of
this
patent
language
that
i’m
not
--
i
think
it
is
my
understanding
that
patents
which
are
abandoned
that
you
are
free
to
terminate
your
patent
application
at
anytime
you
want
to,
and
that
the
material
remain
secret.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
only
thing
that
the
patent
office
publishes
is
patents
which
are
granted.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
where?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
if
it’s
waived,
yes.
if
you
want
to
make
it
free,
you
can.
thank
you.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
that
court
by
a
divided
vote,
held
that
the
ohio
law
of
trade
secrets
was
preempted
by
the
federal
patent
laws.
on
this
basis,
it
reversed
a
judgment
which
had
been
entered
by
the
district
court,
following
an
extensive
trial,
which
had
enjoined
the
respondents
here
from
using
and
disclosing
trade
secrets
which
they
had
learned
while
they
were
in
the
employ
of
the
petitioner.
the
facts
are
relatively
simple
as
far
as
the
issue
before
this
court
is
concerned.
they
maybe
said,
i
think
to
present
a
classic
case
of
equity
jurisdiction.
the
petitioner
threw
an
unincorporated
division
called
harshaw,
and
manufactures
various
products
in
the
chemical
field.
these
include
synthetic
crystals
and
the
particular
product
involved
here
is
sodium
iodide,
thallium
activated
crystals.
that
means
that
it
is
basically
sodium
iodide,
but
by
introducing
some
thallium
in
it,
the
crystal
becomes
effective
in
detecting
radiation.
and
these
crystals
are
useful
in
locating
uranium
ore
and
oil
exploration,
and
through
various
medical
purposes
such
as
detecting
malignant
tumors.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
i’m
sorry,
i
--
apparently
i
am
wrong.
my
recollection
was
it
was
a
divided
vote,
but
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
was
unanimous.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
now
say
they
were
unanimously
wrong.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
harshaw
was
a
pioneer
in
this
field
and
has
been
actively
developing
it
for
25
years.
in
1949,
it
grew
a
sodium
iodide
thallium
activated
crystal,
less
than
two
inches
in
diameter.
by
1966,
after
the
investment
of
much
money
and
effort,
it
was
able
to
grow
a
crystal
17
inches
in
diameter.
and
i
may
say
that
these
crystals
are
grown
in
--
in
platinum
crucibles
that
comes
out
a
very
substantial
mass.
it
is
then
sliced
which
is
a
very
delicate
operation.
it
must
be
quickly
encapsulated
because
it
is
heavily
hydroscopic,
it
will
absorb
moisture.
when
it
absorbs
moisture
it
melts.
this
is
full
of
delicate
operations
and
the
size
of
the
crystal
is
significant
among
other
things
because
that
a
17
inch
crystal
will
more
or
less
cover
the
chest
of
a
person
who
is
being
examined,
whereas
the
smaller
crystals,
you’d
have
to
use
many
and
you
might
miss
places.
worldwide,
there
are
several
companies
that
compete
with
harshaw
in
this
business.
there
are
three
in
the
united
states
other
than
the
respondent,
two
in
japan
and
one
each
in
great
britain
and
france.
up
to
date
however,
no
company
has
grown
or
sold
a
17
inch
diameter
crystal
except
harshaw.
in
producing
such
a
crystal,
harshaw
developed
many
confidential
processes,
procedures
and
techniques
which
it
claims
as
trade
secrets.
there
are
six
individual
defendants,
each
of
them
was
employed
by
harshaw
or
by
a
subsidiary
of
harshaw.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
no
patent
involved
here.
no
claim
is
made
based
on
a
patent.
each
entered
into
a
contract
with
his
employer
that
he
would
not
disclose
the
confidential
information
of
harshaw.
each
of
these
employees
occupied
a
position
of
trust
and
confidence
with
harshaw
and
was
given
access
to
the
secret
operations
in
connection
with
his
employment.
thus,
each
of
the
individual
respondents
was
bound
by
contract
and
by
fiduciary
relationship
resulting
from
his
confidential
employment,
not
to
disclose
harshaw’s
confidential
information.
it’s
one
of
the
traditional
functions
of
equity
to
enforce
such
obligations.
while
still
employed
by
harshaw,
four
of
the
individual
respondents
discussed
the
possibility
of
forming
their
own
business.
in
order
to
have
a
going
business
in
the
shortest
period
of
time,
they
decided
to
make
scintillation
detectors
using
sodium
iodide
thallium
activated
crystals.
during
the
summer
and
fall
of
1969,
they
associated
the
other
individual
respondents
to
them
who
had
recently
left
harshaw’s
employ.
they
built
a
plant
which
was
completed
in
late
1969
or
early
1970
and
soon
had
produced
a
17
inch
sodium
iodide
thallium
activated
scintillation
crystal.
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
imminent
danger
of
disclosure
of
plaintiff’s
trade
secrets
to
bicron
which
was
the
company
they
organized,
and
the
use
of
these
trade
secrets
by
bicron.
in
april
1970,
kewanee
filed
this
suit
to
enjoin
the
individual
defendants
in
bicron
from
using
and
disclosing
kewanee’s
trade
secrets.
there
was
an
extensive
trial.
the
district
court
found
that
kewanee
had
a
protectable
interest
in
20
of
the
40
trade
secrets
on
which
it
relied.
it
held
that
the
other
20
were
common
knowledge
and
could
be
freely
used.
accordingly,
it
entered
in
a
judgment
enjoining
bicron
and
the
individual
respondents
from
disclosing
and
using
the
20
trade
secrets
unless
and
until
they
became
validly,
publicly
known.
both
sides
appealed
from
this
decision.
kewanee
contended
that
all
40
trade
secrets
should
have
been
protected,
while
bircron
cross-appealed
claiming
that
none
of
the
trade
secrets
should
be
protected.
and
the
court
of
appeals
after
reviewing
the
record
held
that
the
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
district
court
were
not
clearly
erroneous
within
the
meaning
of
rule
52
of
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
the
court
further
concluded
that
the
district
court
properly
applied
the
ohio
law
relating
to
trade
secrets,
and
then
it
said
and
i
quote
from
the
opinion
as
it
is
set
out
on
page
16
of
our
brief,
“on
this
record
as
a
whole,
it
appears
clear
to
us
as
it
did
to
the
district
court,
that
the
individual
defendants
used
the
information
obtained
during
their
employment
by
harshaw
for
the
benefit
of
bicron.
there
can
be
no
question
on
this
record,
but
what
these
individual
defendants
appropriated
to
the
benefit
of
bicron,
harshaw’s
secrets,
processes,
procedures
and
manufacturing
techniques.”
and
the
court
of
appeals
then
concluded
that
it
would
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court,
except
for
the
conclusion
that
it
reached,
that
the
ohio
law
trade
secrets
is
in
direct
conflict
with
the
patent
laws
of
the
united
states.
that
is
that
the
law
of
trade
secrets
is
preempted
by
the
patent
laws,
and
on
this
basis
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
order
of
the
district
court
which
had
entered
an
injunction
against
respondents,
and
that
is
the
issue
which
he
has
--
been
brought
here.
now,
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
the
ohio
law
relating
to
trade
secrets.
it’s
similar
to
the
law
which
has
been
long
effect
in
most
of
the
states
and
which
is
derived
from
english
sources
going
back
over
a
century.
it
is
indeed
simply
an
application
of
the
traditional
equity
principle,
where
dealing
with
threatened
breach
of
contract,
or
violations
of
fiduciary
obligation.
obviously,
the
value
of
a
trade
secret
depends
upon
as
being
kept
secret.
this
does
not
mean
that
it
cannot
be
disclosed
in
confidence
or
with
suitable
safeguards
as
a
means
of
utilizing
the
secret.
but
unless
the
safeguards
can
be
enforced,
that
is
the
safeguards
arising
out
of
contract
or
out
of
fiduciary
relationship.
the
secret
will
soon
no
longer
be
a
secret
and
accordingly
will
have
no
value.
a
trade
secret
is
not
the
equivalent
of
a
patent.
a
patent
when
valid,
gives
a
right
reaching
to
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states,
effective
against
every
person
in
the
united
states.
it
is
a
true
governmental
grant
of
a
monopoly.
when
a
patent
is
granted,
there
is
disclosure
to
the
public,
but
no
one
may
utilize
the
device
of
process
without
license
for
a
period
of
17
years.
this
is
true
even
as
to
a
person
who
has
independently
dis
--
conceived
the
same
idea.
it’s
true
as
to
everyone
within
the
outer
limits
of
the
united
states.
it’s
a
true
monopoly.
but
a
trade
secret
is
much
more
limited.
it
finds
its
substance
as
i
have
indicated
in
ordinary
principles
of
equity.
it’s
enforced
against
persons
only
who
have
one
way
or
another,
undertaken
an
obligation
not
to
disclose.
it
may
be
enforced
too
against
persons
who
obtain
the
secret
wrongfully
as
by
bribery
or
by
burglary,
as
to
all
the
world
though,
other
than
those
who
are
bound
by
contract
or
by
fiduciary
duty,
the
trade
secret
maybe
utilized
by
anyone
who
obtains
it
without
wrongdoing.
thus,
it
maybe
uncovered
by
inspection
by
what
is
called
reverse
engineering.
you
take
the
thing
that
you
have
and
a
trained
engineer
works
back
to
see
how
it
was
put
together
or
by
trial
and
error.
it
may
also
be
developed
by
anyone
who
carries
on
the
same
steps
of
research
and
development
which
were
utilized
by
the
original
developer
of
the
trade
secret.
in
this
particular
case,
the
record
shows
that
there
are
a
number
of
competitors
who
are
in
no
way
bound
by
contract
or
by
fiduciary
obligation,
and
all
of
them
are
free
to
develop
the
same
trade
secrets
if
they
can.
now,
this
would
not
be
true
with
respect
to
a
patent
which
binds
all
others
no
matter
how
independent
or
original
their
activities
may
be.
now,
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
state
law
of
trade
secrets
long
in
effect
and
prevalent
throughout
the
united
states,
has
in
some
way
been
preempted
by
the
patent
laws.
it’s
true
of
course
that
congress
has
been
given
power
to
grant
patents.
historically
the
states
granted
patents
in
the
early
days,
but
i
don’t
believe
they
do
now.
it
may
well
be
true
that
congress
could
under
the
necessary
and
proper
law
--
clause
preempt
the
state
law
of
trade
secrets.
just
as
i
suppose
if
congress
could
preempt
the
copyright
field,
so
as
to
invalidate
all
state
legislation
in
that
area.
but
last
term
in
goldstein
against
california,
this
court
refused
to
find
such
an
effect
in
the
constitutional
provision
which
is
identical
with
respect
to
copyrights
and
patents,
and
refused
to
find
it
as
to
a
matter
not
covered
by
the
patent
law
as
enacted
by
--
by
the
copyright
law
as
enacted
by
congress.
and
we
submit
that
the
same
conclusion
should
be
reached
here
with
respect
to
the
impact
of
the
patent
laws
on
the
state
law
of
trade
secrets.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no!
i
do
not
think
so
mr.
justice.
i
think
that
there
is
a
--
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
if
your
position
was
that
because
of
the
constitutional
clause,
no
state
or
--
no
state
can
enact
either
a
patent
or
a
copyright
law,
then
i
think
it
would
follow
that
a
state
could
not
act
--
enact
a
patent
law
just
as
it
was
your
position
that
they
could
not
enact
a
copyright
law.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
our
position
would
be
exactly
the
same.
our
position
is
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
trade
secret
which
we
are
seeking
to
enforce
through
ordinary
equitable
principles
which
is
in
no
way
inconsistent
with
a
patent
and
is
not
a
functional
equivalent
of
a
patent.
although
of
course
it
is
in
--
has
a
related
--
it
is
in
a
related
field
dealing
with
what
might
be
broadly
called
industrial
property.
there
is
nothing
in
the
patent
law
which
expressly
requires
preemption.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
state
trade
secret
law
has
coexisted
with
the
patent
law
in
this
country
for
more
than
a
century
without
interfering
with
anything
that
congress
has
written
in
the
patent
law.
trade
secrets
have
been
clearly
established
in
ohio
at
least
since
the
decision
of
then
superior
court
judge
taft
in
the
case
of
cincinnati
bell
foundry
against
dodds,
decided
in
1887.
this
court
has
many
times
recognized
the
existence
and
validity
of
trade
secrets
in
its
decisions.
we
have
cited
several
of
these
cases
in
our
brief
and
many
more
are
cited
in
the
numerous
amicus
briefs
which
have
been
filed
here.
in
the
dubilier
condenser
case,
this
court
said
that
the
inventor
and
i
quote,
“may
keep
his
invention
secret”
and
that
didn’t
mean
just
keep
it
to
himself
because
it
went
on
to
say,
“and
reap
its
fruits
indefinitely.”
these
decisions
were
outstanding
and
unqualified
when
the
patent
law
was
completely
overhauled
by
congress
in
1952.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
which
indicates
any
disapproval
by
congress
of
the
continuing
validity
of
the
law
of
trade
secrets.
moreover,
this
court
recognized
the
validity
of
trade
secrets
in
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
which
were
adopted
in
1938.
and
congress
has
both
before
and
since
1952,
enacted
many
statutes
which
recognized
the
continuing
validity
of
the
state
law
of
trade
secrets,
these
statutes
both
before
and
after
1952
are
cited
in
appendices
b
and
c
of
our
brief.
the
issue
which
we
see
here
i
think
can
be
put
in
this
way,
congress
could
no
doubt
by
its
action
preempt
the
state
law
of
trade
secrets.
congress
has
taken
no
such
action.
the
pressure
in
that
direction
comes
from
several
decisions
of
this
court
all
dealing
with
other
factual
situations
and
not
involving
trade
secrets.
in
this
connection,
i
would
like
to
call
the
attention
of
the
court
to
an
article
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
by
professor
widick
of
the
university
of
california
at
davis.
when
we
cited
it
we
had
it
only
in
manuscript,
but
i
am
now
advised
that
it
has
been
published
in
the
december
1973
issue
of
the
journal
of
the
patent
office
society,
55
journal
of
the
patent
office
society,
736.
that
issue
publishes
only
the
first
half
of
the
article,
the
second
half
will
be
in
the
january
issue
and
i
will
lodge
copy
of
the
entire
article
with
the
clerk
so
that
it
will
be
available
for
the
court.
now,
it
said
that
the
trade
secrets
in
this
case
are
invalid
because
the
petitioner
has
lost
his
right
to
get
a
patent
on
him.
the
argument
is
based
on
section
102
(b)
of
the
patent
law
which
is
set
out
on
page
3
of
our
brief,
just
above
the
middle
which
reads
that
a
person
shall
be
entitled
to
a
patent
'b'
--
patent
unless
'b'
the
invention
was
in
public
use
in
this
country
more
than
one
year
prior
to
the
date
of
the
application
for
patent
in
the
united
states.
what
this
says
is
that
where
the
idea
has
been
in
public
use
for
a
year,
no
patent
may
be
obtained
and
of
course
we
don’t
contest
that.
it
may
well
be
that
harshaw
has
lost
its
right
to
obtain
a
patent
on
any
of
these
trade
secrets.
however,
harshaw
is
not
claiming
under
the
patent
laws.
it
does
not
seek
a
monopoly
against
the
world.
it
seeks
only
to
invoke
the
traditional
function
of
equity
to
provide
protection
against
breach
of
contract
or
violation
of
fiduciary
responsibilities.
some
of
the
arguments
against
us
in
this
respect
seem
to
beg
the
question.
thus,
in
the
amicus
brief
filed
on
behalf
of
scm
corporation,
it
is
said
on
page
13
that
the
petitioner’s
rights
are
and
i
quote,
“forfeited
to
the
public
by
commercial
use
in
excess
of
one
year,
coupled
with
failure
to
file
a
time;y
patent
application.”
and
there
are
similar
statements
near
the
top
of
pages
18
and
19
and
elsewhere
in
that
brief.
now,
of
course
if
the
petitioner’s
rights
have
been
forfeited,
then
it
has
no
rights
remaining
and
can
get
no
relief
here.
however,
that
is
not
what
the
statute
says
nor
is
there
any
basis
for
reading
the
statute
to
reach
such
a
conclusion.
what
the
statute
says
is
that
a
person
shall
be
entitled
to
a
patent
unless
the
invention
has
been
in
public
use
for
more
than
one
year.
the
only
appropriate
conclusion
from
the
language
is
that
the
right
to
obtain
the
patent
is
gone
after
one
year.
there’s
nothing
in
the
statute
to
support
the
contention
that
the
petitioner
forfeited
to
the
public
under
the
patent
laws
every
right
available
to
it,
including
the
protection
of
long
and
traditionally
made
available
rights,
extended
by
courts
of
equity
against
breach
of
contract
or
violation
of
fiduciary
duty.
the
court
below
and
the
respondents
here
rely
heavily
on
this
court’s
decisions
in
1964
in
sears,
roebuck
and
company
against
stiffel
company
and
compco
corp.
against
day-brite
lighting
company,
both
in
376
u.s.
those
cases
seem
to
us
to
be
clearly
distinguishable.
they
did
not
involve
trade
secrets
nor
did
they
involve
any
threatened
breach
of
contract
or
violation
of
fiduciary
duty.
both
have
some
rather
sweeping
language
applied
to
other
facts,
but
which
may
well
not
be
properly
applicable
on
the
facts
involved
here.
both
of
the
cases
involved
lamps.
in
each
case,
a
design
patent
had
been
obtained
on
the
lamp
and
in
each
case
the
design
patent
had
been
held
invalid.
there
was
of
course
nothing
secret
about
the
lamps.
they
were
sold
to
the
public,
and
they
and
their
design
were
available
for
inspection.
they
could
be
photographed
and
detailed
drawings
could
be
made
of
the
designs.
what
the
illinois
court
did
in
each
case
was
to
hold
that
the
plaintiff
whose
design
patent
had
been
held
invalid
could
nevertheless
obtain
in
mr.
justice
black’s
words
in
the
sears
opinion,
“the
equivalent
of
a
patent
monopoly
on
its
unpatented
lamp.”
it’s
obvious
of
course
that
such
an
injunction
by
the
illinois
court
was
the
function,
only
equivalent
of
a
patent.
it
would
be
effective
against
anybody
who
sought
to
make
the
lamp.
the
relief
obtained
was
as
wide
and
as
broad
as
the
protection
under
a
patent.
it
did
not
depend
in
any
way
on
breach
of
contract
or
violation
of
a
fiduciary
duty.
it
applied
to
anyone
who
sought
to
make
and
market
a
copy
of
the
lamp,
despite
the
fact
that
the
design
patent
had
been
held
invalid.
now
this
court
did
recognize
in
the
opinion
in
the
case
by
mr.
justice
black
that
it
was
not
foreclosing
all
relief.
it
indicated
that
if
there
was
evidence
of
passing
off
that
the
court
could
require
a
labeling
and
otherwise
designating
the
source
of
the
particular
lamp.
but
here
the
respondents
are
not
seeking
to
utilize
material
which
is
known
to
the
public,
or
otherwise
in
the
public
domain.
on
the
contrary,
the
respondents
are
personally
bound
by
contract
and
by
fiduciary
relationship
not
to
disclose
what
has
been
communicated
to
them
in
confidence.
there
is
of
course
an
interrelation
between
the
patent
law
and
the
law
of
trade
secrets.
this
has
been
known
to
the
profession,
to
businessmen,
to
this
court
and
to
congress
for
a
great
many
years.
some
of
the
briefs,
including
particularly
two
of
the
amicus
briefs
present
effects
--
arguments
to
the
effect
that
the
economy
would
be
better
served
by
reducing
the
protection
which
has
long
been
granted
to
trade
secrets.
these
are
arguments
on
which
congress
has
never
acted.
they
are
essentially
legislative
arguments
calling
for
a
change
in
the
law
in
this
area
and
it
has
--
as
it
has
long
been
known
and
understood,
and
as
congress
has
written
it.
in
the
constitutional
field,
it
may
well
be
that
the
court
should
sit
to
some
extent
as
a
continuing
constitutional
convention
bringing
about
changes
in
the
interpretation
of
the
constitution
from
time
to
time,
since
no
one
else
has
power
to
authenticate
the
effect
of
new
developments
and
new
undertakings.
but
there
is
no
reason
for
this
court
to
sit
as
a
continuing
legislative
body.
congress
is
almost
continued
--
continually
in
session
and
it
has
undoubted
power
not
only
to
enact
a
patent
law,
but
also
to
determine
the
impact
of
the
patent
law
on
the
state
law
of
trade
secrets.
many
of
the
arguments
presented
in
support
of
the
decision
below
are
essentially
legislative
arguments
and
should
be
presented
to
congress.
the
fact
is
of
course,
that
congress
has
never
taken
any
explicit
action
which
affects
the
state
law
of
trade
secrets
and
on
the
contrary
it
has
on
many
occasions,
both
before
and
after
the
enactment
of
the
patent
code
of
1952
and
in
the
patent
code
of
1952,
recognized
the
existence
and
continuing
validity
of
trade
secrets
as
they
have
long
existed,
and
under
the
laws
of
the
several
states
pursuant
to
the
traditional
doctrines
of
equity.
for
example,
in
the
patent
code
itself,
congress
provided
that
patent
application
should
be
kept
secret
so
that
if
a
patent
is
eventually
denied,
the
applicant
still
has
whatever
protection
he
is
entitled
to
from
the
trade
secret.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
are
kept
secret
with
certain
exceptions
which
are
specified
in
the
statute
with
a
very
narrow
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
then
it
is
not
made
public
and
the
applicant
continues
to
have
whatever
rights
he
may
have
under
the
law
of
trade
secrets.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
it
is
cited
in
our
brief.
i
will
ask
mr.
springel
to
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--
find
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
finally,
i
would
call
the
court’s
attention
to
the
fact
that
trade
secrets
play
a
major
role
in
the
economy
of
the
united
states,
both
domestic
and
foreign.
many
businesses
have
been
founded
and
conducted
on
the
basis
of
trade
secrets
of
which
the
coca
cola
company
is
perhaps
the
classic
example.
this
is
35
u.s.
code,
section
122
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
and
it
is
cited
in
a
footnote
on
page
35
of
our
brief.
there
are
similar
provision
in
the
regulations
of
the
patent
office.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that’s
my
understanding.
i
think
it's
part
of
the
folklore,
the
legal
folklore
of
the
country,
i
--
i
might
say.
in
recent
years
much
american
know
how,
and
many
american
processes
and
procedures
had
been
licensed
abroad
and
the
royalties
received
for
these
ideas
have
a
very
substantial
impact
on
our
balance
of
payments.
it
seems
odd
indeed
that
because
of
the
patent
laws
designed
to
protect
american
inventors
and
american
industry,
this
whole
structure
of
industrial
property
which
has
been
widely
and
effectively
utilized,
not
hoarded,
not
suppressed,
should
be
in
danger
of
destruction.
there’s
nothing
in
sears
and
compco,
we
submit,
which
is
inconsistent
with
the
continued
application
of
the
state
law
of
trade
secrets.
the
court
below
misconstrued
and
misapplied
those
decisions
in
reaching
its
conclusion
and
accordingly
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
there
were
six
contracts,
mr.
justice.
there
was
a
contract
with
each
of
the
employees.
the
contract
in
the
case
of
hamner
was
with
a
predecessor
company
which
was
taken
over
by
harshaw.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
had
a
what?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
applied
with
respect
to
successors,
yes
and
hamner
was
in
the
employee
of
harshaw
for
awhile
before
he
left.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
were
contracts
with
all
six.
some
of
them
were
employment
contracts.
some
of
them
were
more
sweeping
trade
secret
contracts.
there
was
not
a
trade
secret
contract
with
everyone,
but
there
was
an
employment
contract
with
everyone,
or
a
trade
secret
contract.
this
is
spelled
out
in
the
findings
that
there
was
a
contract
and
either
contract
is
broad
enough
to
cover
what’s
involved
here.
moreover,
they
were
all
employees
so
that
they
are
all
covered
by
law
of
confidential
employees,
so
that
they
were
all
covered
by
the
fiduciary
relationship.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
mr.
justice.
this
is
on
page
89
of
the
appendix
and
conclusion
6
of
the
court.
the
plaintiff
has
submitted
convincing
proof
not
only
that
the
richard
formula
will
not
grow
such
a
crystal,
but
also
that
in
order
to
grow
a
sodium
iodide
thallium
activated
scintillation
crystal,
the
defendants
must
of
necessity
supplement
the
richard
formula
with
plaintiff’s
trade
secrets.
the
court
concludes
that
there
is
an
imminent
danger
of
disclosure
of
plaintiff’s
trade
secrets
to
bicron
and
the
use
of
these
trade
secrets
by
bicron.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
would
violate
the
contract
and
the
fiduciary
relationship.
now,
i
would
like
to
make
a
further
answer
to
the
question
which
mr.
justice
blackmun
asked
me
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument.
with
respect
to
the
opinion
of
justice
marshal
which
justices
blackmun
and
brennan
joined
in
the
goldstein
case.
that
did
not
turn
at
all
on
the
constitutional
question.
it
turned
down
the
fact
that
the
statute
involved
there,
that
is
the
federal
copyright
act
uses
the
exact
wording
of
the
constitution,
specifically
the
words
writings
of
an
author.
and
from
that,
those
three
justices
reached
the
conclusion
that
congress
had
occupied
the
field
and
that
there
was
no
room
for
a
state
statute
in
the
area.
there
is
nothing
comparable
to
that
with
respect
to
the
patent
law.
and
then
with
respect
to
mr.
justice
white’s
question,
i
should
have
been
quicker
in
bringing
to
your
attention
that
the
statute,
the
patent
office
statute
is
printed
in
full
in
our
brief,
title
35,
section
122
is
in
the
appendix
at
page
6
(a).
application
for
patent
shall
be
kept
in
confidence
and
so
on
and
then
on
page
3
(a)
is
the
patent
office
regulation
which
that
statute
puts
into
statutory
language.
pending
patent
applications
are
preserved
in
secrecy.
the
regulation
used
the
word,
though
i
don’t
think
that
there
is
a
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
what
applications?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
they
are
not
published,
they
are
kept
in
secret.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
is
discussed
in
footnote
35,
in
footnote
11
on
--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that’s
a
--
there’s
a
good
deal
of
this
patent
language
that
i’m
not
--
i
think
it
is
my
understanding
that
patents
which
are
abandoned
that
you
are
free
to
terminate
your
patent
application
at
anytime
you
want
to,
and
that
the
material
remain
secret.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
only
thing
that
the
patent
office
publishes
is
patents
which
are
granted.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
where?
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
or
if
it’s
waived,
yes.
if
you
want
to
make
it
free,
you
can.
thank
you.
