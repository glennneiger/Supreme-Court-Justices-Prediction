justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
mccoy,
as
i
understand
your
position
now,
it
is
that
there
had
been
no
violation
of
the
contract?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
i
thought
you
said
earlier
that
there
could
be
a
suit
for
damages
but
i
suppose
you
mean
if
there
had
been
a
violation?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
mccoy,
may
i
ask
you
one
more
question.
you’ve
emphasized
the
fact
that
this
injunction
could
extend
longer
than
the
17-year
period
covered
by
a
patent.
suppose
a
contract
had
provided
for
a
limitation
on
the
use
of
secrets,
only
say
three
years.
would
you
think
an
injunction
would
be
appropriate
by
that?
