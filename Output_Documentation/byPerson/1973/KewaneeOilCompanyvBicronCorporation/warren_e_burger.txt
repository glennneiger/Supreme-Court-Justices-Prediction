your

chief

thank
you
mr.

mr.

chief

warren
e.
burger
well,
is
that
because
it
lasts
longer
than
17
years
in
part?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
of
course
coca
cola
has
managed
to
keep
its
secret
for
more
than
17
years,
haven’t
they?
chief

warren
e.
burger
oh!
that’s
to
avoid
publication,
isn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
no.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what’s
the
difference
between
patent,
what
justice
white’s
asking
you?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
what’s
the
purpose
of
that,
to
protect
the
secrecy
of
confidentiality?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
when
these
dealings
are
over,
which
they
are
substantially
at
the
denial
of
the
application.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
then
what
is
the
rationale
for
continuing
the
confidentiality
of
that
information?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it’s
a
secret.
let’s
keep
it
a
secret,
for
what
purpose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what’s
the
purpose
of
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
suppose
three
members
of
the
patent
office,
technical
staff
who
had
dealt
with
the
patent
application,
resigned
from
the
patent
office
and
set
up
a
company
after
the
patent
application
was
denied,
and
then
begun
producing
the
very
substance
that
was
involved
in
the
confidential
file.
would
you
think
the
court
of
equity
could
enjoin
them?
lay
aside
any
statutory
violation
which
there
might
be,
but
could
a
court
of
equity
stop
them
from
using
this
secret
information?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
there’s
no
patent,
how
do
you
get
any
royalty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but,
then
they
could
be
--
they
could
not
be
enjoined
but
they
could
collect
royalty?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
fiduciary
information?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
then
are
you
suggesting
that
the
remedy
here
is
to
get
some
kind
of
a
--
an
equity
decree
fixing
a
royalty
for
the
use
of
this
material,
this
invention?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
now,
on
your
case.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
your
case,
you
said
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
if
--
then
this
was
followed
by
use
and
production,
then
you
have
indicated,
i
take
it
that
a
court
of
equity
might
fashion
some
kind
of
a
decree
for
royalties,
or
damages?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
isn’t
that
why
some
industries
now
deliberately
refrain
from
seeking
patents
where
they
might
get
them?
if
the
structure
of
the
situation
is
such
that
they
can
preempt
the
market
and
the
field
by
simply
producing
and
hoping
that
no
one
will
be
able
to
exercise
the
reverse
engineering
and
figure
out
how
to
make
it,
make
the
particular
product?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
how
does
that
help
you
here?
you
lost
me
somewhere.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
it
wasn’t
a
secret
--
in
that
case,
it
wasn’t
a
secret
though
was
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
publicly
used?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
yes,
but
there
was
no
patent
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
that
case,
was
there
any
contract
between
them
not
to
disclose?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
be
quite
important,
wouldn’t
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we’ll
pick
up
there
right
after
lunch.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
mr.
mccoy,
we’ve
taken
perhaps
a
little
inordinate
amount
of
your
time
and
you
have
a
--
you
have
a
complex
case
before
us,
so
we’ll
enlarge
you
five
minutes
and
add
something
to
the
solicitor
general,
the
former
solicitor
general
as
well.
hard
to
break
habits
here.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
may
proceed.
so
that
will
give
15
minutes
yet.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
that
in
your
brief
by
the
way?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
would
you
cite
again?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
you
have
another
element
in
this
case
and
that’s
violation
of
a
fiduciary
relationship
alleged,
and
apparently
to
some
extent
found
that
--
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
what
did
the
district
court
find
on
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
just
the
remedy,
is
all
they
disagreed
on?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that’s
another
lawsuit
though,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
well,
the
sears
and
compco
mr.
mccoy,
the
object
was
something
you
could
see
as
to
its
configuration,
just
as
you
could
this
thermal
drinking
cup.
you
can’t
--
a
stranger
can’t
look
at
this
mass
of
crystals
or
whatever
they
are
and
know
how
to
make
it
or
copy
it,
can
he?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
so
some
distinction
between
sears
and
compco
cases
and
this
situation,
in
that
respect.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
can’t
keep
a
secret
or
something
that
you
actually
issue
to
the
whole
world
as
you
do
with
a
book
if
you
publish
it
without
a
copyright,
or
the
lamp
stand
in
these
other
cases,
can
you?
that’s
distinguishable
from
a
trade
secret
situation,
is
it
not,
nothing
very
secret
about
the
lamp
involved
in
these
earlier
cases.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.
mccoy.
do
you
have
anything
further?
chief
justice
warren
e.

the
contract
had
a
succession
clause
in
it,
did
it
not?
chief

warren
e.

clause?
chief

warren
e.

thank
you

the
case
is

i

the

the
conflict

protection
is
preempted
by
operation
of
the
federal
patent
law.
we
conclude
that
until
congress
takes
affirmative
actions
of
the
contrary,
the
states
should
be
free
to
grant
protection
to
trade
secrets.
and
accordingly,
the
