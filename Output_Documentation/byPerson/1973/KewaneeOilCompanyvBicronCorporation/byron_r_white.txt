justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
just
means
that
you
think
they
were
unanimously
wrong?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
--
mr.
griswold
that
applications
for
patent
are
by
statute
secret?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
said
the
--
it
can
be
narrow
when
the
applica
--
if
the
application
is
denied
that
it
is
never
made
public?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
a
reference
to
that
code
by
any
chance?
justice
byron
r.
white
alright,
if
it’s
in
your
brief,
that’s
fine.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
oh!
that’s
better.
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
are
you
suggesting
that
if
a
man
applies
for
a
patent
and
it’s
rejected
as
not
patentable,
say
no
invention,
no
--
that
that
would
be
subject
to
a
--
that
under
your
argument
it
would
be
a
valid
--
could
validly
subject
to
a
trade
secret?
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice
overlap)
justice
byron
r.
white
(voice

that
be
a
--
do
you
think
the
--
this
is
--
you
spin
out
from
as
an
intent
of
congress
to
prohibit
that,
would
you
cut
by
the
virtue
of
patent
laws?
it’s
a
preemption
or
a
conflict
sort
of
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
--
and
so
you
say
congress
could’ve
intended
the
states
trade
secret
law
to
stand
along
with
the
patent
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
do
you
suppose
congress
provides
for
secrecy
of
patent
application?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
there
is
a
specific
provision
in
the
code
that
says
“patent
applications
will
be
kept
secret
if
and
unless
that
the
applicant
permits
the
publication?”
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
that
--
do
you
agree
that
--
that
the
patent
office
interprets
the
statute
to
require
or
permit
the
confidentiality
if
the
application
for
patent
is
denied?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
question
is,
what
is
this
--
that
it
is
congress
--
if
congress
--
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
in
the
patent
laws
has
recognized
that
there
is
a
role
for
secrecy
or
confidentiality
with
respect
to
certain
processes
or
design,
or
patentable
material
or
un-patentable
material?
you
at
least
have
to
get
over
that
in
arguing
that
the
patent
laws
were
intended
to
preempt
state
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
you
--
you
say,
you
have
to
get
around
that
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
just
can’t
say
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
it’s
important.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
let
me
go
back
to
the
question
that
i
asked
you
that
you
didn’t
answer.
do
you
--
is
it
the
practice
of
the
patent
office
when
an
application
is
denied
--
patent
application
is
denied,
do
you
to
still
treat
the
application
confidentially?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
will
not
reveal
it
to
anyone
without
the
consent
of
the
applicant,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
you
suggest
that
that’s
fully
consistent
with
the
act
of
congress?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh!
i
guess,
supposing
you
would
say
there
would
be
a
federal
cause
of
action
against
the
commissioner
of
patents
if
he
proceeded
to
disclose
a
patent
application
whether
pending
or
denied?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
or
by
the
applicant.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
if
there
would,
you
never
would
say
that
the
same
owner
in
the
interest
of
protecting
confidentiality
couldn’t
sue
somebody
who
had
a
contract
with
to
maintain
that
secret?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
saying
he
couldn’t
get
an
injunction
against
--?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
could
get
an
injunction
against
the
commission?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
does
give
only,
the
trade
secret
system
gives
relief
only
against
those
who
have
subject
to
the
trade
secret
restriction?
certainly
isn’t
--
doesn’t
give
a
right
against
the
public
or
anybody
who
independently
arrives
at
this
--
justice
byron
r.
white
if
any
of
that
competitors
came
by
this
information
independently
through
their
own
staff,
it
certainly
wouldn’t
be
subject
to
any
litigation
under
the
trade
secret
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
you
tell
me
what
an
abandoned
patent
application
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
an
abandoned
patent
application?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that
included
one
that’s
been
denied
and
you
don’t
press
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
notice
the
regulations
speak
of
pending
applications
and
abandoned
ones,
but
it
doesn’t
speak
specifically
of
denied
ones.
i
take
it
the
abandoned
category
includes
the
denied
ones?
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
that
it's
specifically
enforceable.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
a
second,
what’s
the
page?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
how
can
you
say
you
could
get
damages?
the
damages
that
you
--
you
get
damages
because
there’s
a
wrongful
use,
a
use
that’s
forbidden,
that
the
law
forbids,
and
you
get
--
justice
byron
r.
white
--
damages
because
the
law
forbids
you
to
break
your
contract.
that’s
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it’s
a
wrongful
use,
but
you
say
equity
could
not
enjoin
the
use?
justice
byron
r.
white
although
the
same
court
could
give
damages
on
--
based
on
the
fact
that
it’s
a
wrongful
use?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
hamner
sign
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
take
it,
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
an
imminent
danger
of
disclosure
of
trade
secret
that
they
were
forbidden
--
that
the
defendants
were
forbidden
to
foreclose?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
found
that
the
--
that
that
disclosure
in
use
would
be
violative
of
contract
to
the
--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
denied
patent
applications,
are
they
published?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
applications
that
don’t
succeed,
that
they
are
--
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
you
find
that
in
the
statute
where
the
(voice

justice
byron

(voice

it
talks
about
abandoned
ones.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron

or
where
it’s
waived?
justice
byron

or
where
it’s

under
another

that
