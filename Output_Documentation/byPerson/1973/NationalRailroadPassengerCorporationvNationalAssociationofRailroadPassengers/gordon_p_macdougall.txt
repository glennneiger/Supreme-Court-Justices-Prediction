mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
gordon
p.
macdougall
representing
the
respondent
here,
the
national
association
of
railroad
passengers.
it’s
a
non-profit
corporation,
with
its
principal
office
in
washington
d.c.,
also
joined
us
on
amicus
by
the
national
association
of
regulatory
utility
commissioners
or
the
state
regulatory
agencies
of
the
50
states.
and
we
support
the
decision
below
which
held
that
public
--
for
a
non
--
i
might
say
persons
other
than
the
attorney
general
and
labor
organizations
have
a
right
to
enforce
legal
duties
imposed
by
the
rail
passenger
service
act
of
1970.
i
might
say
it’s
not
in
the
briefs
and
all
of
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioner
amtrak
was
filed
i
guess
about
a
week
ago.
but
also
the
president
just
a
week
ago
signed
a
new
law,
public
law
93146
which
made
substantial
revisions
in
amtrak
act.
now
that
pl
93146
was
not
available
as
of
friday
and
hadn’t
been
printed
(voice
overlap).
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
it
makes
certain
changes
in
the
periods
of
section
404.
i
don’t
think
it
changes
the
principles
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
it
does
change
the
statute.
yes.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
it
changes
a
number
about
seven
or
eight
sections
of
the
statute.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no
change
in
section
307
(a).
i
might
say
that
the
department
of
transportation
as
shown
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
of
the
petition
here.
i
have
the
march
15,
1973
report
of
the
department
of
transportation
upon
the
amtrak
act
with
certain
legislator
recommendations.
and
one
of
the
legislator
recommendations
of
dot
was
to
eliminate
judicial
review
of
passenger
train
discontinuance
as
congress
did
not
adopt
that
recommendation
and
the
extensive
amendments
which
were
approved
by
the
president
last
week
do
not
embrace
any
changes
to
section
307
(a)
or
to
the
right
of
persons
to
take
decisions
of
the
icc
and
pass
the
discontinuance
cases
to
court
and
for
judicial
review
left
--
that
part
was
left
unchanged.
the
dot’s
recommendations
were
not
followed.
now
the
opinion
below
was
35
pages,
it
was
unanimous
and
it’s
our
judgment
that
the
southern
railway
is
under
illegal
duty
by
virtue
of
section
404
of
the
amtrak
act
to
operate
in
nancy
hanks
passenger
train
between
atlanta
and
savannah
until
at
least
january
1,
1975,
unless
it
contracts
with
amtrak
before
that
time.
and
that
the
discontinuance
which
took
place
on
may
1,
1971
purportedly
under
section
401
(a),
one
of
the
act
was
in
violation
of
the
act
and
breached
its
duty
to
the
public
the
way
every
passenger
train
operating
between
those
two
cities.
we,
passengers
association
are
in
the
class
to
be
protected
by
the
act
and
it
is
the
interest
to
be
protected.
we
do
not
look
at
the
amtrak
act
as
being
primarily
as
indicated
perhaps
this
morning
as
a
way
for
the
railroads
to
unload
their
passenger
trains.
to
be
sure,
there
is
some
wordings
in
the
committees’
report
particularly
the
house
committee
reports
say
that
certainly
some
kinds
of
an
act
have
to
be
discontinued
but
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
not
to
discontinue
trains
but
to
keep
trains
in
operation
to
expand
trains.
the
purpose
was
to
prevent
the
complete
abandonment
of
service.
the
complete
corporation
was
selected
to
“revitalize
real
passenger
service.”
and
that
the
overriding,
the
committee
said
the
overriding
purpose
of
this
legislation
is
to
preserve
and
promote
intercity
rail
passenger
service.
that
the
--
we
just
--
we
were
very
active.
the
narp
were
very
active
in
getting
the
amtrak
act
through
congress
and
we
do
not
look
at
it
as
the
primary
function
was
to
allow
discontinuance
of
trains.
we
look
at
it
as
to
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
we
look
at
section
307
(a)
as
a
super
section.
but
that
is
that
we
have
the
right
to
sue
that
307
(a)
was
something
because
this
was
going
to
be
a
quasi
governmental
corporation
too
and
since
the
attorney
general
might
not
have
the
right
to
go
in
and
sue
amtrak,
we
look
at
this
is
a
super
section.
otherwise,
to
give
the
attorney
general
remedies
beyond
that
which
any
ordinary
person
would
have
or
which
the
attorney
general
would
otherwise
have.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
we
made
no
effort
to
put
a
specific
section
on
judicial
review
and
in
fact,
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
shows
anything
on
this
other
than
that
the
railway
labor
people,
certainly,
the
railway
labor
people,
al
chesser
of
the
utu
testified,
he
said,
to
the
way
it
looks
it
appears
that
the
public
doesn’t
have
the
right
to
judicial
review,
he
said
it
appears.
attorney
hickey
who
represented
a
competing
or
a
rather
different
railway
labor
group
which
mr.
chesser
is
not
in,
the
railway
labor
executive
association,
he
said,
well,
look
to
him
that
the
statute
did
not
allow
judicial
review.
so
he
proposed
both
mr.
chesser
and
mr.
hickey
propose
amendments
that
were
exactly
the
same
to
amend
section
307
(a)
on
their
theory,
to
get
judicial
review.
the
committee
said
nothing
about
it
in
the
report.
the
railway
management
opposed
labor’s
amendment
and
hence,
labor
management
didn’t
say
what
they
opposed
of
the
amendment.
it
just
said
we
opposed.
mr.
hickey
said
that
to
the
committee
and
as
soon
the
tetimony
said
railway
management
has
opposed
to
it.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
our
position
is
that
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
well,
we
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
the
--
we
look
at
section
307
which
was
taken
from
the
comsat
act.
this
was
taken
as
--
what
the
changes
from
the
comsat
act.
if
we
looked
at
that
section,
it
has
given
the
attorney
general
powers
that
an
ordinary
person
wouldn’t
have.
we
felt
that
we
have
and
there
was
no
need
of
what
we
have
the
right
to
go
to
court.
the
courts
have
jurisdiction
under
1337,
28
u.s.c.
1337.
this
is
a
–-
there
is
no
question
that
the
courts
have
jurisdiction.
there
is
no
question
that
under
section
404,
the
certain
duties
the
railroad
has
to
continue
train
service
unless
it
contracts
with
amtrak.
and
we
didn’t
see
any
particular
need
for
a
specific
section
just
to
duplicate
28
u.s.c.
1337,
it
says
you
can
go
to
court.
the
courts
do
have
jurisdiction.
he
owen
effect
--
what
wolby
said,
secretary
wolby
came,
the
title
of
this
section
is
by
the
way
“sanctions.”
he
said,
sanctions
are
normally
imposed
by
the
government.
just
consequently
he
would
be
opposed
to
meeting
any
person
to
seek
enforcement
of
the
act
of
section
307.
as
he
looked
at
the
sanctions.
something
above
and
beyond
judicial
review.
and
then
he
said
with
respect
to
inclusion
of
railroads,
he
said
he
thinks
existing
statutes
apply
to
them.
and
it
says
to
a
certain
--
to
an
extent
the
corporation
is
exempt
from
such
statutes
or
statutory
requirements.
the
consequent
basis
i
am
not
sure
that
would
be
necessary
to
make
sanctions
applicable
to
any
railroad.
so
this
is
particularly
so
here
for
such
sanctions
expressly
reached
“any
action
practice
for
policy.”
the
corporation
has
a
quasi
public
character
in
many
respects
and
the
scope
of
the
sanctions
with
respect
to
it
is
appropriate.
what
i
--
so
i
turned
section
307
as
a
super
section,
to
safeguard
the
public
interest
because
congress
was
creating
a
quasi
public
corporation.
and
i
didn’t
want
to
have
all
the
litigation
controlled
by
private
parties.
they
want
to
give
the
attorney
general
power
to
jump
in
at
some
times.
i
might
say
that
section
307
doesn’t
say
that
only
the
attorney
general
can
bring
suits.
it
says
that
the
attorney
general
is
authorized
to
bring
suit
and
the
word
authorize
comes
from
the
committee
report.
the
committee
report
in
describing
section
307
said
it
authorize
the
attorney
general
to
go
to
court.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
you
mean
if
--
i
don’t
quite
get
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
it's
a
question
if
there
was
a
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
i
question
whether
he
could.
under
section
517
of
the
title
28
as
i
--
it
says
the
attorney
general
can
go
to
court
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
it
says
of
--
and
it
doesn’t
say
much
more
than
that.
it's
kind
of
a
weak
section.
it
just
says
that
the
attorney
general
can
always
go
to
court
but
it
doesn’t
say
what
he
can
do
and
this
question
came
up
during
the
legislative
history
of
the
comsat
law,
communications
sattelite
act
of
1962.
that’s
where
section
307
comes
from
and
there
was
a
lot
of
debate
on
setting
up
comsat.
all
of
the
government
research,
that
they're
going
to
the
space
program
and
it
wants
it’s
--
as
a
result
special
powers
in
the
attorney
general
and
therefore
i
think
that
if
the
section
had
been
silent
as
to
the
attorney
general,
there’s
a
severe
doubt
that
he
could
do
the
things
that
congress
intended
him
to
because
this
section
says,
attorney
general
can
go
to
anything
that
violates
the
purposes
and
policies
of
the
act.
that’s
what
it
is,
purposes
and
policies.
and
it
says
any
threatened
action,
he
can
go
and
get
an
injunction.
it’s
kind
of
broad.
in
fact,
there’s
some
doubt.
the
justice
department
has
expressed
some
doubt
as
to
the
powers
from
our
brief
which
is
the
white
covered
brief
on
pages
29
and
30.
particularly
on
page
30,
we
have
a
letter
there
--
mr.
gray,
assistant
attorney
general
to
congressman
slack
which
was
submitted
in
the
case
to
which
this
was
consolidated
below
and
they
say
that
department
justice
said
that
the
attorney
general
does
not
have
the
authority
to
sue
for
construction
of
the
act
or
to
enjoin
a
purely
technical
violation
rather
the
authority
to
sue
is
granted
to
protect
and
enhance
the
legislative
purpose.
and
they
have
a
lot
of
doubt
about
it
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
when
the
comsat
section,
which
is
section
403,
communications
sattelite
act
of
1962
was
carried
over
to
the
amtrak
section.
a
certain
phrase
was
deleted
and
that
was
the
phrase
that
allows
--
would
allow
the
attorney
general
to
go
for
a
specific
violation
of
the
act.
that
clause
reads,
“or
if
the
corporation
or
any
other
person
shall
violate
any
provision
of
this
chapter.”
none
other
words,
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general
to
go
after
a
violation
of
any
provision
was
deleted
from
the
communication’s
act
when
it
was
carried
over
to
the
amtrak
act.
and
there’s
some
doubt
as
to
what
--
considerable
doubt
as
to
what
power
the
attorney
general
really
has
here.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
the
attorney
general
has
never
gone
into
court.
we've
asked
them
to
do
it.
we
filed
a
suit.
narp
did
in
the
fall
of
1970
against
union
pacific.
judge
jones
granted
an
injunction
and
the
railroad
withdrew
the
discontinuance
act
in
kansas
city.
it
filed
another
suit
in
the
supreme
of
1971
against
the
southern
railway
for
discontinuance.
judge
june
green
gave
us
an
injunction,
railroad
dropped
it.
both
these
cases,
the
attorney
general
didn’t
come
in,
we
had
to
do
it
ourselves.
and
there
was
of
course
the
question
of
standing
at
that
time.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
there
is
a
section
in
the
amtrak
act
which
when
the
early
section,
section
301,
it
doesn’t
say
anything
about
that.
it
just
says
the
corporation
is
hereby
created
in
washington
d.c.
section
301
and
302
and
i
see
nothing
in
it
that
authorize
the
corporation
to
be
sued
or
be
sued.
in
fact
one
of
the
matters
raised
by
the
court
of
appeals
was,
what
if
amtrak
has
to
dispute
with
another
railroad,
particularly
was
stick
to
the
amounts
due
under
section
401
that
cause
for
joining
amtrak
and
so
forth.
what
if
amtrak
disagrees?
amtrak
is
not
giving
power
to
sue
under
section
307
(a)
if
you
look
at
it
that
way.
it
just
says
the
attorney
general
can
do
it
or
labor
organization,
amtrak
or
railroad
are
not
covered
as
plaintiffs
the
way
section
307
reads.
so
that’s
why
we
think
that
section
307
is
really
meant
to
be
a
super
section
to
protect
(voice
overlap).
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
well,
it
says
they
can
sue.
they
said
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
unless
otherwise
prohibited
by
law.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
a
part
of
it,
unless
otherwise
prohibited
seems
to
have
come
from
the
comsat
acts
and
not
to
allow
the
attorney
general
to
get
injunction
against
labor
unions.
it
appears
to
be
that’s
where
it
comes
in.
not
--
no
history
about
it
though
when
congress
was
debating
the
amtrak
act.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
it
goes
to
either
the
state
commission
or
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
that?
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
if
it's
a
--
the
train
operates
between
two
states
to
give
a
notice.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
right.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
the
icc,
they
need
to
decide
as
to
hold
an
investigation
or
not
to?
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
that’s
four
months.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
if
the
commission
institutes
an
investigation
that
requires
continued
operation
during
that
period.
if
the
train
operates
wholly
within
one
state
which
is
the
nancy
hanks,
it
must
go
to
the
state
commission.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
it
must
go
to
state
commission
first.
you
cannot
go
to
icc
and
that
is
carried
over
unto
the
amtrak.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
i
would
say
that
if
a
railroad
–-
well,
let’s
put
it
this
way,
yes
in
some
cases
and
it
depends
upon
the
state
law
that
would
govern
because
the
interstate
section
1381
was
an
optional
statute
that
go
the
icc
or
go
to
each
state
served
by
the
train.
so
it
will
depend
on
the
state
law.
our
point
is
here,
apart
from
that
that
the
congress
said
intercity
rails
passenger
service
shall
be
continued
if
a
railroad
doesn’t
join
amtrak.
there's
a
positive
obligation
in
the
amtrak
law
(voice
overlap).
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
not
necessarily,
only
if
the
train
has
been
operated
by
amtrak
for
more
than
two
years.
otherwise,
amtrak
could
discontinue
the
trains
without
going
to
states.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
depends
upon
whether
it’s
in
the
basic
system.
trains
in
the
basic
system
for
two
years
or
operated
by
amtrak
for
two
years
then
amtrak
must
go
through
the
icc.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
under
the
statute,
the
way
we
construe
it,
the
railroad
must
contract.
that’s
the
best
our
complaint
below
that
they
must
contract
for
it
with
amtrak
for
all
of
their
intercity
passenger
service.
they
can’t
like
the
southern
does.
pick
and
choose.
take
the
profitable
lines
in
washington
d.c.
to
new
orleans
run
that
itself
but
let
the
nancy
hanks
join
the
subsidiary.
they're
joining
amtrak
and
discontinue
that.
the
statute
says,
401
(a)
(1)
that
the
railroad
must
contract
with
amtrak
for
all
of
the
intercity
passenger
service
operated
by
that
railroad.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no.
where
it
--
no,
where
the
--
as
the
administrative
procedure,
that
should
--
has
to
be
followed
but
the
amtrak
could
discontinue
trains
apart
from
the
administrative
procedure,
trains
operated
less
than
two
years.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
this
train
was
not
subject
to
the
icc
at
all.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
it
was
subject
to
if
the
southern
had
contracted
for
all
of
the
intercity
passenger
service
then
it
could
give
notices
effective
may
1,
1971
to
discontinue
all
their
intercity
passenger
service
without
any
intervention
by
the
icc.
in
fact,
that’s
what
happens
throughout
the
country.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
it
was
subject
to
the
georgia
public
service
commission
because
it
operated
wholly
within
georgia.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
it
didn’t
have
to
because
under
its
theory
it
was
contracting
with
amtrak
and
thereby
was
able
to
just
give
a
notice
on
may
1,
they
would
discontinue
the
trains.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
to
the
public.
to
give
a
notice
to
the
public
and
file
it
with
the
icc.
and
the
icc
says
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no.
the
icc
issued
regulations
in
march
of
1971
saying
that
they
do
not
have
jurisdiction
to
stop
it.
it
was
just
a
filing
for
notice
provision,
that’s
all.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
there
is
inter
and
intrastate
trains.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no.
there
were
no
provisions
to
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
today,
today
now.
if
we
are
to
have
a
discontinuance
today
--
today
that
is
and
of
course
these
other
railroads
on
operating
trains
today
it’s
mostly
amtrak
just
a
few
railroads
operating
today.
if
the
southern
works
are
discontinued
today,
they'd
have
to
go
to
icc.
so
with
amtrak
unless
it's
a
train
of
amtrak
is
not
operated
for
two
years.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
they
were
not.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no.
even
if
they
--
even
if
it
had
been
proper.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
why
not?
because
when
the
amtrak
act
was
passed,
if
they
followed
certain
procedures
in
the
amtrak
statute
they
were
allowed
to
discontinue
the
train.
now
if
the
southern
railway
contracted
for
all
of
its
intercity
service
with
amtrak
then
the
southern
was
allowed
by
the
statute
to
follow
notice
to
discontinue
the
service.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
with
the
governors
of
all
the
states
and
with
the
icc
and
post
it
at
all
of
the
stations.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
no.
it
hasn’t
been.
no.
it
would
not
be.
you
see,
there
were
527
intercity
trains
before
may
1,
19--
there
are
some
disputes
how
many
--
527
intercity
trains.
the
railroad
was
supposed
to
notice
to
discontinue
all
of
them
except
those
who
didn’t
join
amtrak
and
then
amtrak
decided
which
ones
to
operate
and
operate
its
own
service.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
the
railroads.
this
suit
is
primarily
against
the
railroad
(voice
overlap)
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
amtrak
only
decid
--
well,
amtrak
didn’t
have
complete
freedom.
amtrak
had
to
operate
the
basic
system
service
plus
service
above
that
which
they
wanted
to
operate.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
this
--
amtrak
did
not
contract
for
any
service
to
be
maintained
by
the
central
of
georgia
lines
of
the
southern?
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
i
would
think
amtrak
--
if
the
contract
was
valid
with
there
southern
railway
system.
it
could,
yes.
it
could
have
operate
it.
made
an
agreement
with
the
central
of
georgia
to
operate,
yes.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
it
didn’t.
right.
we’re
not
--
we’re
assuming
that
on
the
ground
that
southern
has
to
have
all
of
its
service.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
all
or
nothing.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
right.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
it
must
--
the
nancy
hanks
must
not
be
discontinued
until
january
1,
1975
by
section
404
of
the
amtrak
statute.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
absolute
prohibition.
it
can’t
discontinue
by
state
law,
icc
or
anything
unless
through
the
southern
railway.
the
southern
railway
if
we
assume
they
could
--
not
contract
for
their
--
to
amtrak
for
their
new
orleans
to
washington
d.c.
train,
the
southern
railway
cannot
discontinue
that
train
until
january
1,
1975.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
unless
it
decides
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
right.
that’s
a
specific
obligation
on
the
public.
i
mean
on
the
railroads
it
must
maintain
the
service
to
the
public
until
january
1,
1975.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
it
made
an
affirmative
duty
on
the
railroad,
an
affirmative
right
from
the
railroad
passenger
to
get
that
service
to
january
1,
1975.
it
cannot
discontinue
andyu
transport
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
nope.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
i
really
don’t
know.
its
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
well,
the
southern
railway
has
the
equipment
to
run
the
train.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
[laughter
attempt]
i
think
--
i
really
don’t
know.
i
really
don’t
know
where
it
is.
its
part
of
--
i
just
don’t
know
who
discontinued
and
if
we
basically
(voice
overlap).
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
well,
the
southern
–-
it
doesn’t
that
way
to
have
a
pool
of
equipment
of
diesel
equipment
and
a
pool
of
coach
cars.
i
don’t
think
and
in
fact
there
is
a
surplus
now
if
railroad
coaches
and
railroad
equipment
and
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
difficulty
in
restoring
that
one
train
should
--
would
be
entitled
to.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
right.
you’re
having
here
whether
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
right
to
go
to
court
to
assert
a
duty
which
still
the
railroad
owes
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
the
lower
court
assumed
the
validity
of
our
position
and
one
under
the
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
right.
i'll
point
out
to
you
that
the
--
there’s
no
structure
within
the
government,
within
the
attorney
general’s
office
for
making
any
decision
as
to
whether
to
go
to
court
or
not.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
page
42
(a)
--
43
(a)
of
the
petition
for
cert
which
is
a
very
dark
blue
document.
what
the
attorney
general
does
is
it
gives
to
amtrak,
in
this
case
to
mr.
william
o.
bittman
who
was
the
attorney
for
amtrak
in
this
case.
he
is
to
mr.
bittman
the
authority
to
raise
the
question
or
if
he
wants
him
or
not.
when
the
attorney
general
does
decide
to
go
to
court
--
as
indicated
in
the
petition
for
cert.
they
just
tell
amtrak,
well,
if
you
want
raise
it
for
the
judge
you
can
and
here’s
your
authority
to
speak
on
behalf
of
the
attorney
general.
there
is
no
section
on
--
to
enforce
the
amtrak
law
within
the
department
of
justice.
there
is
no
framework
of
expertise
as
a
letter
of
a
certain
attorney
general
gray
which
i
pointed
out
in
page
30
of
our
brief
--
130
of
our
brief
says,
dot
has
the
expertise.
department
of
justice
doesn’t
have
any
expertise
on
this.
there’s
no
statutory
framework
or
administrative
agencies
such
as
we
have
on
the
halloway
case
which
was
cited
to
us
this
morning.
and
if
there
isn’t
a
right
to
go
to
court
there
is
just
as
not
going
to
be
anyway
to
--
for
us
to
have
our
rights
asserted.
there
is
no
way.
the
attorney
general
is
not
qualified.
all
it
does
is
delegate
to
the
attorney
for
the
amtrak
to
represent
the
position
of
the
government
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
show
why
a
committee.
the
next
it
was
a
sub-committee
of
the
house.
why
the
sub
--
it
rejected
labor’s
amendment,
labor’s
amendment
would've
gone
further
and
ask
for
right
for
damages
and
other
things
and
the
only
thing
that
go
--
the
way
we
look
at
it
is
that,
this
section
was
to
be
a
super
section.
a
section
to
authorize
the
attorney
general
to
go
into
court
because
there
are
important
interests
of
the
government
at
stake
in
setting
up
the
amtrak
act.
there's
a
lot
of
money
involved.
it
was
a
quasi
public
thing.
the
president
appoints
all
the
directors
and
that
this
required
special
public
attention,
special
standing
for
the
attorney
general.
the
last
thing
i
like
to
say
is
that,
allowing
access
to
court
will
not
frustrate
the
statutory
purpose.
it
counts
from
the
petitioner
said
that
the
--
this
one
single
train
that’s
continued
why
it’s
going
to
be
disaster.
what
congress
assumed
that
sometimes
amtrak
would
not
be
allowed
to
discontinue
a
train
that
amtrak
wanted
to
discontinue?
they
contemplated
amtrak
might
lose
a
case
here
or
there.
and
there’s
just
as
the
only
way
to
allow
the
purposes
of
the
amtrak
act
to
be
fulfilled
is
to
allow
private
suits
we
feel.
i
made
a
lot
of
argument
in
their
brief
on
adequacy
of
services
while
forgetting
discontinuances.
what
about
people
who
have
complaints
as
to
meal
service,
private
cars,
reservation
proceeding
--
procedures,
no
smoking
sections
and
so
forth.
can
anybody
to
go
to
court
on
that.
well,
the
answer
is
the
amtrak
act
by
section
801
has
said
you
go
to
the
icc
on
that.
they
say
the
icc
shall
set
the
standards
so
there’s
no
danger
from
inadequacy
of
service
standpoint
that
they
are
going
to
be
a
multitudes
of
suits.
the
real
thing
is
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
they
do.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
they
--
in
the
amtrak
act
section
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
the
amtrak
statute
says
for
adequacy
of
service.
the
icc
is
obligated
to
set
up
the
regulations
and
also
that
section
was
one
of
those
amended
last
and
is
known
part
of
public
law
in
93146.
so
as
to
the
standards
of
service
and
everything,
there
is
a
procedure
and
that’s
the
icc,
was
put
in
there.
so
really
what
we’re
talking
about
is
discontinuances
and
allowing
private
suits
will
enhance
the
statutory
scheme.
there
simply
is
no
remedy
elsewhere.
there
is
no
staff
at
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
that’s
one
of
the
options.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
the
statute
is
as
clear
--
if
they
have
a
case,
they
can
file
it
in
court
but
that
would
have
to
be
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
it
does
not.
they'd
have
to
go
to
court
and
say
--
point
to
some
of
sections
of
the
amtrak
statute
that
gives
--
that
makes
amtrak
is
a
duty
upon
amtrak
to
provide
certain
service
to
a
community
on
a
certain
circumstances.
it
have
to
point
to
where
the
amtrak
statute
makes
a
duty
on
amtrak
to
do
something.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
that’s
right.
there
is
a
duty
in
that.
right.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
and
if
amtrak
didn't
do
it,
presumably
they
would
--
that
they
wold
go
to
court
and
say
amtrak
is
in
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
there
is
on
that
--
i
believe
in
that
there's
a
provision
for
arbitration
by
the
department
of
transportation.
i’m
not
sure
there
is
a
section
on
that.
section
403
(voice
overlap)
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
i
would
think
it
have
to
--
in
any
time,
you
go
to
court
you
have
to
exhaust.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
and
ours
is
not
because
these
are
the
discontinuances
that
came
effective
may
1,
1971
when
the
railroad
posted
527
intercity
trains.
we
thought
there
were
only
360.
there’s
a
question
of
what
is
an
intercity
train,
what’s
a
commuter
train,
that
is
one
issue
now
on
the
courts.
other
issue
is
did
the
southern
railway
contract
for
all
of
its
service,
did
they
or
did
they
not?
and
there’s
no
remedy
administered
to
remedy
for
that
and
there’s
no
remedy
in
the
department
of
justice.
we
tried
mandamus
in
one
case
and
mandamus
is
not
the
remedy
either.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
my
name
is
gordon
p.
macdougall
representing
the
respondent
here,
the
national
association
of
railroad
passengers.
it’s
a
non-profit
corporation,
with
its
principal
office
in
washington
d.c.,
also
joined
us
on
amicus
by
the
national
association
of
regulatory
utility
commissioners
or
the
state
regulatory
agencies
of
the
50
states.
and
we
support
the
decision
below
which
held
that
public
--
for
a
non
--
i
might
say
persons
other
than
the
attorney
general
and
labor
organizations
have
a
right
to
enforce
legal
duties
imposed
by
the
rail
passenger
service
act
of
1970.
i
might
say
it’s
not
in
the
briefs
and
all
of
the
reply
brief
of
the
petitioner
amtrak
was
filed
i
guess
about
a
week
ago.
but
also
the
president
just
a
week
ago
signed
a
new
law,
public
law
93146
which
made
substantial
revisions
in
amtrak
act.
now
that
pl
93146
was
not
available
as
of
friday
and
hadn’t
been
printed
(voice
overlap).
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
it
makes
certain
changes
in
the
periods
of
section
404.
i
don’t
think
it
changes
the
principles
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
it
does
change
the
statute.
yes.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
it
changes
a
number
about
seven
or
eight
sections
of
the
statute.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no
change
in
section
307
(a).
i
might
say
that
the
department
of
transportation
as
shown
in
the
appendix
to
the
brief
of
the
petition
here.
i
have
the
march
15,
1973
report
of
the
department
of
transportation
upon
the
amtrak
act
with
certain
legislator
recommendations.
and
one
of
the
legislator
recommendations
of
dot
was
to
eliminate
judicial
review
of
passenger
train
discontinuance
as
congress
did
not
adopt
that
recommendation
and
the
extensive
amendments
which
were
approved
by
the
president
last
week
do
not
embrace
any
changes
to
section
307
(a)
or
to
the
right
of
persons
to
take
decisions
of
the
icc
and
pass
the
discontinuance
cases
to
court
and
for
judicial
review
left
--
that
part
was
left
unchanged.
the
dot’s
recommendations
were
not
followed.
now
the
opinion
below
was
35
pages,
it
was
unanimous
and
it’s
our
judgment
that
the
southern
railway
is
under
illegal
duty
by
virtue
of
section
404
of
the
amtrak
act
to
operate
in
nancy
hanks
passenger
train
between
atlanta
and
savannah
until
at
least
january
1,
1975,
unless
it
contracts
with
amtrak
before
that
time.
and
that
the
discontinuance
which
took
place
on
may
1,
1971
purportedly
under
section
401
(a),
one
of
the
act
was
in
violation
of
the
act
and
breached
its
duty
to
the
public
the
way
every
passenger
train
operating
between
those
two
cities.
we,
passengers
association
are
in
the
class
to
be
protected
by
the
act
and
it
is
the
interest
to
be
protected.
we
do
not
look
at
the
amtrak
act
as
being
primarily
as
indicated
perhaps
this
morning
as
a
way
for
the
railroads
to
unload
their
passenger
trains.
to
be
sure,
there
is
some
wordings
in
the
committees’
report
particularly
the
house
committee
reports
say
that
certainly
some
kinds
of
an
act
have
to
be
discontinued
but
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
not
to
discontinue
trains
but
to
keep
trains
in
operation
to
expand
trains.
the
purpose
was
to
prevent
the
complete
abandonment
of
service.
the
complete
corporation
was
selected
to
“revitalize
real
passenger
service.”
and
that
the
overriding,
the
committee
said
the
overriding
purpose
of
this
legislation
is
to
preserve
and
promote
intercity
rail
passenger
service.
that
the
--
we
just
--
we
were
very
active.
the
narp
were
very
active
in
getting
the
amtrak
act
through
congress
and
we
do
not
look
at
it
as
the
primary
function
was
to
allow
discontinuance
of
trains.
we
look
at
it
as
to
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
we
look
at
section
307
(a)
as
a
super
section.
but
that
is
that
we
have
the
right
to
sue
that
307
(a)
was
something
because
this
was
going
to
be
a
quasi
governmental
corporation
too
and
since
the
attorney
general
might
not
have
the
right
to
go
in
and
sue
amtrak,
we
look
at
this
is
a
super
section.
otherwise,
to
give
the
attorney
general
remedies
beyond
that
which
any
ordinary
person
would
have
or
which
the
attorney
general
would
otherwise
have.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
we
made
no
effort
to
put
a
specific
section
on
judicial
review
and
in
fact,
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
shows
anything
on
this
other
than
that
the
railway
labor
people,
certainly,
the
railway
labor
people,
al
chesser
of
the
utu
testified,
he
said,
to
the
way
it
looks
it
appears
that
the
public
doesn’t
have
the
right
to
judicial
review,
he
said
it
appears.
attorney
hickey
who
represented
a
competing
or
a
rather
different
railway
labor
group
which
mr.
chesser
is
not
in,
the
railway
labor
executive
association,
he
said,
well,
look
to
him
that
the
statute
did
not
allow
judicial
review.
so
he
proposed
both
mr.
chesser
and
mr.
hickey
propose
amendments
that
were
exactly
the
same
to
amend
section
307
(a)
on
their
theory,
to
get
judicial
review.
the
committee
said
nothing
about
it
in
the
report.
the
railway
management
opposed
labor’s
amendment
and
hence,
labor
management
didn’t
say
what
they
opposed
of
the
amendment.
it
just
said
we
opposed.
mr.
hickey
said
that
to
the
committee
and
as
soon
the
tetimony
said
railway
management
has
opposed
to
it.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
our
position
is
that
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
well,
we
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
the
--
we
look
at
section
307
which
was
taken
from
the
comsat
act.
this
was
taken
as
--
what
the
changes
from
the
comsat
act.
if
we
looked
at
that
section,
it
has
given
the
attorney
general
powers
that
an
ordinary
person
wouldn’t
have.
we
felt
that
we
have
and
there
was
no
need
of
what
we
have
the
right
to
go
to
court.
the
courts
have
jurisdiction
under
1337,
28
u.s.c.
1337.
this
is
a
–-
there
is
no
question
that
the
courts
have
jurisdiction.
there
is
no
question
that
under
section
404,
the
certain
duties
the
railroad
has
to
continue
train
service
unless
it
contracts
with
amtrak.
and
we
didn’t
see
any
particular
need
for
a
specific
section
just
to
duplicate
28
u.s.c.
1337,
it
says
you
can
go
to
court.
the
courts
do
have
jurisdiction.
he
owen
effect
--
what
wolby
said,
secretary
wolby
came,
the
title
of
this
section
is
by
the
way
“sanctions.”
he
said,
sanctions
are
normally
imposed
by
the
government.
just
consequently
he
would
be
opposed
to
meeting
any
person
to
seek
enforcement
of
the
act
of
section
307.
as
he
looked
at
the
sanctions.
something
above
and
beyond
judicial
review.
and
then
he
said
with
respect
to
inclusion
of
railroads,
he
said
he
thinks
existing
statutes
apply
to
them.
and
it
says
to
a
certain
--
to
an
extent
the
corporation
is
exempt
from
such
statutes
or
statutory
requirements.
the
consequent
basis
i
am
not
sure
that
would
be
necessary
to
make
sanctions
applicable
to
any
railroad.
so
this
is
particularly
so
here
for
such
sanctions
expressly
reached
“any
action
practice
for
policy.”
the
corporation
has
a
quasi
public
character
in
many
respects
and
the
scope
of
the
sanctions
with
respect
to
it
is
appropriate.
what
i
--
so
i
turned
section
307
as
a
super
section,
to
safeguard
the
public
interest
because
congress
was
creating
a
quasi
public
corporation.
and
i
didn’t
want
to
have
all
the
litigation
controlled
by
private
parties.
they
want
to
give
the
attorney
general
power
to
jump
in
at
some
times.
i
might
say
that
section
307
doesn’t
say
that
only
the
attorney
general
can
bring
suits.
it
says
that
the
attorney
general
is
authorized
to
bring
suit
and
the
word
authorize
comes
from
the
committee
report.
the
committee
report
in
describing
section
307
said
it
authorize
the
attorney
general
to
go
to
court.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
you
mean
if
--
i
don’t
quite
get
your
question
mr.
justice.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
it's
a
question
if
there
was
a
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
i
question
whether
he
could.
under
section
517
of
the
title
28
as
i
--
it
says
the
attorney
general
can
go
to
court
to
protect
the
interest
of
the
united
states.
it
says
of
--
and
it
doesn’t
say
much
more
than
that.
it's
kind
of
a
weak
section.
it
just
says
that
the
attorney
general
can
always
go
to
court
but
it
doesn’t
say
what
he
can
do
and
this
question
came
up
during
the
legislative
history
of
the
comsat
law,
communications
sattelite
act
of
1962.
that’s
where
section
307
comes
from
and
there
was
a
lot
of
debate
on
setting
up
comsat.
all
of
the
government
research,
that
they're
going
to
the
space
program
and
it
wants
it’s
--
as
a
result
special
powers
in
the
attorney
general
and
therefore
i
think
that
if
the
section
had
been
silent
as
to
the
attorney
general,
there’s
a
severe
doubt
that
he
could
do
the
things
that
congress
intended
him
to
because
this
section
says,
attorney
general
can
go
to
anything
that
violates
the
purposes
and
policies
of
the
act.
that’s
what
it
is,
purposes
and
policies.
and
it
says
any
threatened
action,
he
can
go
and
get
an
injunction.
it’s
kind
of
broad.
in
fact,
there’s
some
doubt.
the
justice
department
has
expressed
some
doubt
as
to
the
powers
from
our
brief
which
is
the
white
covered
brief
on
pages
29
and
30.
particularly
on
page
30,
we
have
a
letter
there
--
mr.
gray,
assistant
attorney
general
to
congressman
slack
which
was
submitted
in
the
case
to
which
this
was
consolidated
below
and
they
say
that
department
justice
said
that
the
attorney
general
does
not
have
the
authority
to
sue
for
construction
of
the
act
or
to
enjoin
a
purely
technical
violation
rather
the
authority
to
sue
is
granted
to
protect
and
enhance
the
legislative
purpose.
and
they
have
a
lot
of
doubt
about
it
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
when
the
comsat
section,
which
is
section
403,
communications
sattelite
act
of
1962
was
carried
over
to
the
amtrak
section.
a
certain
phrase
was
deleted
and
that
was
the
phrase
that
allows
--
would
allow
the
attorney
general
to
go
for
a
specific
violation
of
the
act.
that
clause
reads,
“or
if
the
corporation
or
any
other
person
shall
violate
any
provision
of
this
chapter.”
none
other
words,
the
authority
of
the
attorney
general
to
go
after
a
violation
of
any
provision
was
deleted
from
the
communication’s
act
when
it
was
carried
over
to
the
amtrak
act.
and
there’s
some
doubt
as
to
what
--
considerable
doubt
as
to
what
power
the
attorney
general
really
has
here.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
the
attorney
general
has
never
gone
into
court.
we've
asked
them
to
do
it.
we
filed
a
suit.
narp
did
in
the
fall
of
1970
against
union
pacific.
judge
jones
granted
an
injunction
and
the
railroad
withdrew
the
discontinuance
act
in
kansas
city.
it
filed
another
suit
in
the
supreme
of
1971
against
the
southern
railway
for
discontinuance.
judge
june
green
gave
us
an
injunction,
railroad
dropped
it.
both
these
cases,
the
attorney
general
didn’t
come
in,
we
had
to
do
it
ourselves.
and
there
was
of
course
the
question
of
standing
at
that
time.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
there
is
a
section
in
the
amtrak
act
which
when
the
early
section,
section
301,
it
doesn’t
say
anything
about
that.
it
just
says
the
corporation
is
hereby
created
in
washington
d.c.
section
301
and
302
and
i
see
nothing
in
it
that
authorize
the
corporation
to
be
sued
or
be
sued.
in
fact
one
of
the
matters
raised
by
the
court
of
appeals
was,
what
if
amtrak
has
to
dispute
with
another
railroad,
particularly
was
stick
to
the
amounts
due
under
section
401
that
cause
for
joining
amtrak
and
so
forth.
what
if
amtrak
disagrees?
amtrak
is
not
giving
power
to
sue
under
section
307
(a)
if
you
look
at
it
that
way.
it
just
says
the
attorney
general
can
do
it
or
labor
organization,
amtrak
or
railroad
are
not
covered
as
plaintiffs
the
way
section
307
reads.
so
that’s
why
we
think
that
section
307
is
really
meant
to
be
a
super
section
to
protect
(voice
overlap).
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
well,
it
says
they
can
sue.
they
said
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
unless
otherwise
prohibited
by
law.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
a
part
of
it,
unless
otherwise
prohibited
seems
to
have
come
from
the
comsat
acts
and
not
to
allow
the
attorney
general
to
get
injunction
against
labor
unions.
it
appears
to
be
that’s
where
it
comes
in.
not
--
no
history
about
it
though
when
congress
was
debating
the
amtrak
act.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
it
goes
to
either
the
state
commission
or
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
that?
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
if
it's
a
--
the
train
operates
between
two
states
to
give
a
notice.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
right.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
the
icc,
they
need
to
decide
as
to
hold
an
investigation
or
not
to?
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
that’s
four
months.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
if
the
commission
institutes
an
investigation
that
requires
continued
operation
during
that
period.
if
the
train
operates
wholly
within
one
state
which
is
the
nancy
hanks,
it
must
go
to
the
state
commission.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
it
must
go
to
state
commission
first.
you
cannot
go
to
icc
and
that
is
carried
over
unto
the
amtrak.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
i
would
say
that
if
a
railroad
–-
well,
let’s
put
it
this
way,
yes
in
some
cases
and
it
depends
upon
the
state
law
that
would
govern
because
the
interstate
section
1381
was
an
optional
statute
that
go
the
icc
or
go
to
each
state
served
by
the
train.
so
it
will
depend
on
the
state
law.
our
point
is
here,
apart
from
that
that
the
congress
said
intercity
rails
passenger
service
shall
be
continued
if
a
railroad
doesn’t
join
amtrak.
there's
a
positive
obligation
in
the
amtrak
law
(voice
overlap).
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
not
necessarily,
only
if
the
train
has
been
operated
by
amtrak
for
more
than
two
years.
otherwise,
amtrak
could
discontinue
the
trains
without
going
to
states.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
depends
upon
whether
it’s
in
the
basic
system.
trains
in
the
basic
system
for
two
years
or
operated
by
amtrak
for
two
years
then
amtrak
must
go
through
the
icc.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
under
the
statute,
the
way
we
construe
it,
the
railroad
must
contract.
that’s
the
best
our
complaint
below
that
they
must
contract
for
it
with
amtrak
for
all
of
their
intercity
passenger
service.
they
can’t
like
the
southern
does.
pick
and
choose.
take
the
profitable
lines
in
washington
d.c.
to
new
orleans
run
that
itself
but
let
the
nancy
hanks
join
the
subsidiary.
they're
joining
amtrak
and
discontinue
that.
the
statute
says,
401
(a)
(1)
that
the
railroad
must
contract
with
amtrak
for
all
of
the
intercity
passenger
service
operated
by
that
railroad.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no.
where
it
--
no,
where
the
--
as
the
administrative
procedure,
that
should
--
has
to
be
followed
but
the
amtrak
could
discontinue
trains
apart
from
the
administrative
procedure,
trains
operated
less
than
two
years.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
this
train
was
not
subject
to
the
icc
at
all.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
it
was
subject
to
if
the
southern
had
contracted
for
all
of
the
intercity
passenger
service
then
it
could
give
notices
effective
may
1,
1971
to
discontinue
all
their
intercity
passenger
service
without
any
intervention
by
the
icc.
in
fact,
that’s
what
happens
throughout
the
country.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
it
was
subject
to
the
georgia
public
service
commission
because
it
operated
wholly
within
georgia.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
it
didn’t
have
to
because
under
its
theory
it
was
contracting
with
amtrak
and
thereby
was
able
to
just
give
a
notice
on
may
1,
they
would
discontinue
the
trains.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
to
the
public.
to
give
a
notice
to
the
public
and
file
it
with
the
icc.
and
the
icc
says
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no.
the
icc
issued
regulations
in
march
of
1971
saying
that
they
do
not
have
jurisdiction
to
stop
it.
it
was
just
a
filing
for
notice
provision,
that’s
all.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
there
is
inter
and
intrastate
trains.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no.
there
were
no
provisions
to
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
today,
today
now.
if
we
are
to
have
a
discontinuance
today
--
today
that
is
and
of
course
these
other
railroads
on
operating
trains
today
it’s
mostly
amtrak
just
a
few
railroads
operating
today.
if
the
southern
works
are
discontinued
today,
they'd
have
to
go
to
icc.
so
with
amtrak
unless
it's
a
train
of
amtrak
is
not
operated
for
two
years.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
they
were
not.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no.
even
if
they
--
even
if
it
had
been
proper.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
why
not?
because
when
the
amtrak
act
was
passed,
if
they
followed
certain
procedures
in
the
amtrak
statute
they
were
allowed
to
discontinue
the
train.
now
if
the
southern
railway
contracted
for
all
of
its
intercity
service
with
amtrak
then
the
southern
was
allowed
by
the
statute
to
follow
notice
to
discontinue
the
service.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
with
the
governors
of
all
the
states
and
with
the
icc
and
post
it
at
all
of
the
stations.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
no.
it
hasn’t
been.
no.
it
would
not
be.
you
see,
there
were
527
intercity
trains
before
may
1,
19--
there
are
some
disputes
how
many
--
527
intercity
trains.
the
railroad
was
supposed
to
notice
to
discontinue
all
of
them
except
those
who
didn’t
join
amtrak
and
then
amtrak
decided
which
ones
to
operate
and
operate
its
own
service.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
the
railroads.
this
suit
is
primarily
against
the
railroad
(voice
overlap)
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
amtrak
only
decid
--
well,
amtrak
didn’t
have
complete
freedom.
amtrak
had
to
operate
the
basic
system
service
plus
service
above
that
which
they
wanted
to
operate.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
this
--
amtrak
did
not
contract
for
any
service
to
be
maintained
by
the
central
of
georgia
lines
of
the
southern?
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
i
would
think
amtrak
--
if
the
contract
was
valid
with
there
southern
railway
system.
it
could,
yes.
it
could
have
operate
it.
made
an
agreement
with
the
central
of
georgia
to
operate,
yes.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
it
didn’t.
right.
we’re
not
--
we’re
assuming
that
on
the
ground
that
southern
has
to
have
all
of
its
service.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
all
or
nothing.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
right.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
it
must
--
the
nancy
hanks
must
not
be
discontinued
until
january
1,
1975
by
section
404
of
the
amtrak
statute.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
absolute
prohibition.
it
can’t
discontinue
by
state
law,
icc
or
anything
unless
through
the
southern
railway.
the
southern
railway
if
we
assume
they
could
--
not
contract
for
their
--
to
amtrak
for
their
new
orleans
to
washington
d.c.
train,
the
southern
railway
cannot
discontinue
that
train
until
january
1,
1975.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
unless
it
decides
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
right.
that’s
a
specific
obligation
on
the
public.
i
mean
on
the
railroads
it
must
maintain
the
service
to
the
public
until
january
1,
1975.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
it
made
an
affirmative
duty
on
the
railroad,
an
affirmative
right
from
the
railroad
passenger
to
get
that
service
to
january
1,
1975.
it
cannot
discontinue
andyu
transport
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
nope.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
i
really
don’t
know.
its
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
well,
the
southern
railway
has
the
equipment
to
run
the
train.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
[laughter
attempt]
i
think
--
i
really
don’t
know.
i
really
don’t
know
where
it
is.
its
part
of
--
i
just
don’t
know
who
discontinued
and
if
we
basically
(voice
overlap).
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
well,
the
southern
–-
it
doesn’t
that
way
to
have
a
pool
of
equipment
of
diesel
equipment
and
a
pool
of
coach
cars.
i
don’t
think
and
in
fact
there
is
a
surplus
now
if
railroad
coaches
and
railroad
equipment
and
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
difficulty
in
restoring
that
one
train
should
--
would
be
entitled
to.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
right.
you’re
having
here
whether
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
right
to
go
to
court
to
assert
a
duty
which
still
the
railroad
owes
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
the
lower
court
assumed
the
validity
of
our
position
and
one
under
the
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
right.
i'll
point
out
to
you
that
the
--
there’s
no
structure
within
the
government,
within
the
attorney
general’s
office
for
making
any
decision
as
to
whether
to
go
to
court
or
not.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
page
42
(a)
--
43
(a)
of
the
petition
for
cert
which
is
a
very
dark
blue
document.
what
the
attorney
general
does
is
it
gives
to
amtrak,
in
this
case
to
mr.
william
o.
bittman
who
was
the
attorney
for
amtrak
in
this
case.
he
is
to
mr.
bittman
the
authority
to
raise
the
question
or
if
he
wants
him
or
not.
when
the
attorney
general
does
decide
to
go
to
court
--
as
indicated
in
the
petition
for
cert.
they
just
tell
amtrak,
well,
if
you
want
raise
it
for
the
judge
you
can
and
here’s
your
authority
to
speak
on
behalf
of
the
attorney
general.
there
is
no
section
on
--
to
enforce
the
amtrak
law
within
the
department
of
justice.
there
is
no
framework
of
expertise
as
a
letter
of
a
certain
attorney
general
gray
which
i
pointed
out
in
page
30
of
our
brief
--
130
of
our
brief
says,
dot
has
the
expertise.
department
of
justice
doesn’t
have
any
expertise
on
this.
there’s
no
statutory
framework
or
administrative
agencies
such
as
we
have
on
the
halloway
case
which
was
cited
to
us
this
morning.
and
if
there
isn’t
a
right
to
go
to
court
there
is
just
as
not
going
to
be
anyway
to
--
for
us
to
have
our
rights
asserted.
there
is
no
way.
the
attorney
general
is
not
qualified.
all
it
does
is
delegate
to
the
attorney
for
the
amtrak
to
represent
the
position
of
the
government
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
show
why
a
committee.
the
next
it
was
a
sub-committee
of
the
house.
why
the
sub
--
it
rejected
labor’s
amendment,
labor’s
amendment
would've
gone
further
and
ask
for
right
for
damages
and
other
things
and
the
only
thing
that
go
--
the
way
we
look
at
it
is
that,
this
section
was
to
be
a
super
section.
a
section
to
authorize
the
attorney
general
to
go
into
court
because
there
are
important
interests
of
the
government
at
stake
in
setting
up
the
amtrak
act.
there's
a
lot
of
money
involved.
it
was
a
quasi
public
thing.
the
president
appoints
all
the
directors
and
that
this
required
special
public
attention,
special
standing
for
the
attorney
general.
the
last
thing
i
like
to
say
is
that,
allowing
access
to
court
will
not
frustrate
the
statutory
purpose.
it
counts
from
the
petitioner
said
that
the
--
this
one
single
train
that’s
continued
why
it’s
going
to
be
disaster.
what
congress
assumed
that
sometimes
amtrak
would
not
be
allowed
to
discontinue
a
train
that
amtrak
wanted
to
discontinue?
they
contemplated
amtrak
might
lose
a
case
here
or
there.
and
there’s
just
as
the
only
way
to
allow
the
purposes
of
the
amtrak
act
to
be
fulfilled
is
to
allow
private
suits
we
feel.
i
made
a
lot
of
argument
in
their
brief
on
adequacy
of
services
while
forgetting
discontinuances.
what
about
people
who
have
complaints
as
to
meal
service,
private
cars,
reservation
proceeding
--
procedures,
no
smoking
sections
and
so
forth.
can
anybody
to
go
to
court
on
that.
well,
the
answer
is
the
amtrak
act
by
section
801
has
said
you
go
to
the
icc
on
that.
they
say
the
icc
shall
set
the
standards
so
there’s
no
danger
from
inadequacy
of
service
standpoint
that
they
are
going
to
be
a
multitudes
of
suits.
the
real
thing
is
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
yes,
they
do.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
they
--
in
the
amtrak
act
section
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
the
amtrak
statute
says
for
adequacy
of
service.
the
icc
is
obligated
to
set
up
the
regulations
and
also
that
section
was
one
of
those
amended
last
and
is
known
part
of
public
law
in
93146.
so
as
to
the
standards
of
service
and
everything,
there
is
a
procedure
and
that’s
the
icc,
was
put
in
there.
so
really
what
we’re
talking
about
is
discontinuances
and
allowing
private
suits
will
enhance
the
statutory
scheme.
there
simply
is
no
remedy
elsewhere.
there
is
no
staff
at
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
that’s
one
of
the
options.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
the
statute
is
as
clear
--
if
they
have
a
case,
they
can
file
it
in
court
but
that
would
have
to
be
--
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
no,
it
does
not.
they'd
have
to
go
to
court
and
say
--
point
to
some
of
sections
of
the
amtrak
statute
that
gives
--
that
makes
amtrak
is
a
duty
upon
amtrak
to
provide
certain
service
to
a
community
on
a
certain
circumstances.
it
have
to
point
to
where
the
amtrak
statute
makes
a
duty
on
amtrak
to
do
something.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
that’s
right.
there
is
a
duty
in
that.
right.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
and
if
amtrak
didn't
do
it,
presumably
they
would
--
that
they
wold
go
to
court
and
say
amtrak
is
in
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
there
is
on
that
--
i
believe
in
that
there's
a
provision
for
arbitration
by
the
department
of
transportation.
i’m
not
sure
there
is
a
section
on
that.
section
403
(voice
overlap)
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
i
would
think
it
have
to
--
in
any
time,
you
go
to
court
you
have
to
exhaust.
mr.
gordon
p.
macdougall
and
ours
is
not
because
these
are
the
discontinuances
that
came
effective
may
1,
1971
when
the
railroad
posted
527
intercity
trains.
we
thought
there
were
only
360.
there’s
a
question
of
what
is
an
intercity
train,
what’s
a
commuter
train,
that
is
one
issue
now
on
the
courts.
other
issue
is
did
the
southern
railway
contract
for
all
of
its
service,
did
they
or
did
they
not?
and
there’s
no
remedy
administered
to
remedy
for
that
and
there’s
no
remedy
in
the
department
of
justice.
we
tried
mandamus
in
one
case
and
mandamus
is
not
the
remedy
either.
