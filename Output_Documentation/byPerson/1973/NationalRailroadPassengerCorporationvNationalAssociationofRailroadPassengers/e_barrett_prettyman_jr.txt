mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
barrett
prettyman
and
i
represent
the
petitioners
in
this
case
which
is
hereon
certiorari
from
the
d.c.
circuit.
the
case
presents
rather
a
narrow
question,
namely,
which
parties
can
sue
for
alleged
violations
of
the
rail
passenger
service
act
of
1970,
the
amtrak
act.
we
claim,
petitioner’s
claim
that
under
the
statutory
language
and
pursuant
to
the
congressional
intent,
only
the
attorney
general
and
where
a
labor
agreement
is
involved,
employees
and
their
representatives
can
sue
for
these
alleged
violations.
respondent
which
is
an
association
of
railroad
passengers,
claims
that
anyone
who
is
injured
and
aggrieved
by
an
alleged
violation
of
the
act
can
bring
suit
to
federal
district
court.
that
really
is
the
only
issue
before
the
court
this
morning.
before
i
go
into
the
facts
of
the
immediate
case,
i’d
like
to
give
you
just
a
brief
background
of
the
act
itself
because
it
bears
on
the
problem.
this
act
was
passed
because
of
a
genuine
concern
on
behalf
of
the
congress
and
the
people
that
all
intercity
passenger
traffic
in
this
country
was
going
to
disappear.
in
1929,
there
were
20,000
passenger
trains
in
this
country.
and
by
1970,
there
were
only
360.
the
plain,
hard,
cold
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
passengers
in
this
country
simply
could
not
pay
the
high
cost
of
operating
this
train.
at
the
same
time,
congress
in
passing
the
act
did
not
intend
to
stop
all
discontinuances
of
trains.
quite
to
the
contrary,
it
recognized
that
some
additional
paring
was
in
order
if
any
rail
passenger
traffic
was
going
to
be
preserved.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
p-a-r
sir.
p-a-r-i-n-g,
paring.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
some
additional
cutting
down,
yes
sir.
therefore
congress
devised
a
rather
elaborate
plan,
purpose
of
which
was
instead
of
the
individual
railroads
hereafter
deciding
which
train
and
when
it
was
going
to
submit
the
icc
for
paring
down,
instead
the
secretary
of
transportation
would
construct
a
basic
system
of
passenger
service.
the
minimum
system
that
the
country
should
have
and
that
would
consist
therefore
of
all
essential
service
which
hopefully
would
be
preserved.
and
a
corporation
was
formed,
amtrak,
which
was
given
power
to
enter
into
contracts
with
various
--
to
railroads
and
take
over
their
passenger
service
to
be
funded
by
government
funds,
tickets,
and
the
railroads
themselves
paying
entry
fees.
the
corporation,
amtrak
would
operate
this
basic
system
and
would
either
operate
or
discontinue
the
excess
service
above
the
basic
system.
i’d
like
to
emphasize
again
now
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
not
to
preserve
all
passenger
service
but
rather
in
the
words
of
the
house
report
to
effect
a
rational
reduction
of
present
service
in
order
to
save
any
passenger
service.
when
the
act
became
effective,
the
secretary
of
transportation
did
designate
the
basic
system,
a
21-city
pairs
(p-a-i-r)
with
42
trains
running
daily
as
part
of
the
basic
system
as
it
developed.
when
amtrak
took
over
passenger
service,
it
actually
operated
originally
some
180-passenger
trains
and
today
that’s
up
to
a
198.
the
central
of
georgia’s
only
remaining
passenger
trains
just
prior
to
the
passage
of
this
act
were
the
nancy
hanks
between
savannah
and
atlanta
and
trains
13
and
14
between
albany,
georgia
and
birmingham.
and
these
trains
were
not
part
of
the
basic
system.
consequently,
notice
was
given
of
their
discontinuance
and
on
april
1,
1971
when
the
act
did
become
effective,
those
trains
were
discontinued.
however,
prior
to
that
the
respondent
here
brought
a
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
against
amtrak,
the
central
of
georgia
and
the
southern
railway
seeking
a
temporary
restraining
order
to
prevent
the
discontinuance
of
these
three
trains.
it
was
alleged
that
the
act
was
violated
because
of
the
relationship
between
central
and
southern.
southern
down
and
virtually
all
of
the
stock
of
central.
southern
itself
had
decided
not
to
enter
into
contract
with
amtrak.
but
the
central
of
georgia
had
and
they
claimed
north,
the
railroad
association
here
claimed
that
either
the
entire
railway
system
had
to
enter
into
a
contract
or
no
part
of
it
could.
no
subsidiary
could.
and
it
sought
a
permanent
injunction
restraining
the
parties
from
enforcing
any
contract
which
did
not
include
the
entire
southern
system.
the
district
court
denied
the
temporary
restraining
order
and
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
theory
that
narp
had
no
standing
because
of
section
307
which
provides
that
if
amtrak
or
any
railroad
violates
the
act,
the
district
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
upon
petition
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
in
the
case
involved
in
the
labor
agreement
upon
petition
of
any
employee
affected
thereby
including
duly
authorized
employee
representatives.
and
the
district
courts
were
given
jurisdiction
to
grant
equitable
release
upon
petition
of
those
parties.
now
it’s
clear
that
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
held
that
there
was
standing.
that's
clear
that
congress
has
the
authority
to
limit
the
right
to
sue
under
an
act
of
this
kind.
this
court
has
so
held
in
other
cases.
so
the
only
question
here
really
is
whether
congress
intended
to
do
so.
did
it
intend
to
restrict
the
right
to
sue?
we
think
very
clearly
it
did.
we
just
take
the
statutory
language
standing
alone.
we’ll
note
that
it
doesn’t
provide
specifically
that
anyone
aggrieved
or
injured
can
sue.
it
does
not
even
provide
that
the
specified
remedies
in
the
statute
are
in
addition
to
other
remedies.
it
doesn’t
even
provide
that
the
specified
remedies
didn’t
extinguish
any
remedy
or
right
of
action
not
in
consistent
herewith
which
it
has
done
in
other
statutes.
and
instead,
specifically
names
the
persons
who
are
going
to
be
able
to
petition
the
court.
in
this
case
however,
we
do
not
have
to
rely
upon
the
words
of
the
statute
alone
because
there
are
some
very
specific
and
direct
legislative
history
that
goes
right
to
the
point
before
the
court.
in
the
original
draft
of
the
bill,
the
district
court
was
given
jurisdiction
to
sue
amtrak,
amtrak
alone
--
given
jurisdiction
when
there
is
a
suit
against
amtrak
alone.
upon
petition
of
the
attorney
general
or
in
the
case
involved
in
a
labor
agreement
upon
petition
of
any
individual
affected
thereby.
now,
you’ll
note
two
things
about
that.
first
of
all,
amtrak
alone
could
be
sued
and
secondly,
it
didn’t
say
anything
about
labor
representatives
just
the
employees.
at
the
hearings
which
ensue
labor
representatives
came
along
with
ten
proposed
amendments
to
the
act.
one
of
them
would
have
specifically
allowed
any
aggrieved
party
to
bring
a
suit
for
violation
of
the
act.
as
labor
spokesman
said
as
the
bill
now
reads,
only
the
attorney
general
except
in
cases
involving
a
labor
agreement
could
bring
actions.
now
the
secretary
of
transportation
who
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
this
act
in
including
--
following
up
on
various
sections
of
it,
thereupon
wrote
the
committee
a
letter
addressing
himself
to
the
various
proposed
amendments.
and
he
said,
i
would
oppose
--
i
would
be
opposed
to
permitting
any
person
to
seek
enforcement
of
section
307.
now
thereupon
what
happen?
this
is
important
because
this
is
not
a
case
opassengers.
f
legislative
history
where
we
have
the
committee
ignoring
people
who
have
submitted
views
on
the
contrary.
the
committee
actually
did
make
specific
changes
in
the
bill.
for
example,
according
to
following
labor’s
wish
which
the
secretary
had
no
objection
to;
they
added
specifically
that
representatives
of
employees
could
sue
as
well
as
the
employees
themselves.
again,
following
labor’s
wish
and
the
secretary
thought
it
was
unnecessary
but
it
didn’t
oppose
it.
they
introduced
the
allowing
other
railroads
to
be
sued
as
well
as
amtrak.
in
other
words,
not
just
amtrak
alone
but
other
railroads
could
also
be
sued
under
the
act.
but
because
of
the
secretary’s
objection,
the
committee
specifically
refused
to
introduce
this
concept
of
permitting
all
aggrieved
persons
to
sue.
the
secretary
had
objected
to
it
and
the
committee
left
it
out
and
the
bill
was
passed
without
it.
it
seems
perfectly
clear
to
us
from
this
that
congress
intended
only
those
parties
that
were
designated
in
the
bill
in
the
statute
to
be
able
to
sue.
this
case
therefore
becomes
like
switchmen’s
union
and
montana-dakota
utilities
and
fleischmann
distilling,
and
calhoon
versus
harvey
and
so
forth.
the
cases
where
the
specific
remedies
which
were
mentioned
excluded
others
including
suits
by
aggrieved
parties.
in
addition
however,
there
are
very
important
policy
reasons
why
congress
left
out
aggrieved
parties
and
why
this
court
should
not
sanction
it.
the
secretary
of
transportation,
the
icc
and
amtrak,
all
were
given
very
unusual
authority
and
responsibility
to
fashion
a
workable
passenger
transportation
system
in
this
act.
for
example,
this
amtrak
is
supposed
to
make
a
profit
eventually
even
though
it
was
recognized
that
these
various
railroads
were
losing
millions
on
their
passenger
traffic.
so
it
is
a
very
complex
and
difficult
job
that
was
fashioned
here.
and
if
anybody
can
sue
the
railroad,
certain
things
are
clearly
going
to
happen.
for
example,
even
if
there’s
a
single
suit
in
regard
to
the
discontinuance
of
an
important
line,
you
are
going
to
have
delays
if
temporary
restraining
orders
are
entered
which
as
our
brief
shows
could
cost
literally
millions
to
amtrak.
but
even
more
importantly,
if
more
than
one
person
sues,
if
suits
are
brought
in
regard
to
a
single
discontinuance
in
alabama
and
then
georgia,
etcetera,
you’re
going
to
have
the
possibility
of
not
only
the
temporary
delays
of
one
case
but
you’re
going
to
have
possibilities
of
conflict
between
circuits
which
are
going
to
unduly
delay
the
discontinuances
that
are
clearly
called
for
by
the
act.
this
case
therefore
becomes
similar
to
halloway
versus
brist-myers
which
is
cited
to
the
court
in
our
reply
brief
which
interestingly
was
decided
by
--
also
by
the
d.c.
circuit
but
by
a
completely
different
panel
from
the
panel
that
decided
the
instant
case.
and
they
decided
that
the
private
party
even
though
aggrieved
does
not
have
a
right
to
sue
under
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
and
the
court
specifically
pointed
out
the
vexatious
litigation
that
could
ensue.
it
pointed
out
to
private
parties
may
institute
piecemeal
lawsuits
reflecting
disparate
concerns
and
not
a
coordinated
enforcement
program.
that
same
principle
is
precisely
applicable
here.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
i
hope
you
have
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i’ll
see
that
you
get
one,
(voice
overlap)
i’m
sorry.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
was
filed
about
a
week
ago.
finally,
to
allow
brief
persons
to
sue
here
simply
makes
no
sense
if
you
look
at
the
overall
plan
of
the
act.
right
now,
no
discontinuances
of
the
basic
system
are
allowed.
they
won’t
be
allowed
until
july
1
of
1974.
after
july
1
of
1974,
the
railroad
amtrak
if
it
wants
to
discontinue
a
basic
service
train
it
has
to
give
30
days
notice.
thereupon,
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
if
it
decides
not
to
investigate
under
section
13
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
that
is
the
end
of
it.
and
this
court
has
said
in
city
of
chicago
that
there
is
no
appeal
by
a
private
person
from
that
decision
not
to
investigate.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
icc
does
investigate
the
discontinuance
and
passes
upon
it,
an
aggrieved
party
can
appeal
that
ruling
to
the
court.
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
certainly
in
regard
to
the
basic
system,
it
makes
no
sense
whatever
to
allow
an
aggrieved
party
to
bypass
this
procedure
which
has
been
established
and
to
rush
in
to
the
district
court
with
an
original
suit
even
before
the
icc
had
a
chance
to
operate.
in
other
words,
so
that
i’m
clear,
a
notice
is
given
a
discontinuance
and
before
the
icc
even
gets
to
decide
whether
it’s
going
to
investigate
private
party
runs
into
the
district
court
and
brings
on
original
suit
and
wants
to
sue
because
of
the
discontinuance.
that
doesn’t
make
any
sense.
as
to
the
non-basic
system
track,
certainly
the
court
would
not
allow
a
private
party,
a
broader
authority
to
attack
the
discontinuance
of
a
non-basic
system
train
than
it
would,
a
basic
system
train
because
congress
has
specifically
provided
right
here
in
the
act
that
a
non-basic
system
train
can
be
discontinued
at
any
time
just
with
30
days
notice.
that’s
all
that’s
necessary.
and
the
congressional
will
having
been
expressed
that
you
can
discontinue
that
easily
a
non-basic
service
train,
it
certainly
makes
no
sense
to
allow
an
aggrieved
person
to
run
into
court
and
attempt
to
attack
it.
so
on
all
of
these
grants
it
seems
to
us
on
the
basis
--
the
statutory
language
as
it
stands,
on
the
basis
of
the
legislative
history
which
i
pointed
out
where
the
aggrieved
party
was
specifically
left
out
on
the
basis
of
the
public
interest
involved
and
seen
that
amtrak
can
really
operate
and
discontinue,
etcetera
and
finally
on
the
basis
of
common
sense
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
scheme.
we
think
that
clearly
that
district
court
was
right
in
throwing
out
this
case.
i
might
just
add
that
the
attorney
general,
the
responsible
official
under
the
act
agrees
with
us
as
expressed
both
in
letters
and
by
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
which
has
been
filed
before
the
court.
the
united
states
agrees
that
aggrieved
parties
cannot
sue
and
that
the
responsible
official
for
bringing
lawsuits
for
discontinuance
etcetera
is
the
attorney
general.
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
unless
the
court
has
questions.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
indulge
just
a
moment
because
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
thought
perhaps
--
yes,
i’ll
answer
that
and
track
it
through
for
you
if
i
may
just
quickly
refer
mr.
justice
white
to
403
(b)
sir,
there
is
a
specific
provision
if
the
community
and
the
railroad
and
amtrak
can’t
reach
an
agreement,
it
goes
to
the
secretary
of
transportation
forum.
now
let’s
go
back
before
the
act
was
passed
and
follow
this
through.
and
mr.
justice
white
raised
the
key
question
here,
this
act
is
not
cutoff
a
right
which
was
a
prior
right
which
existed
before.
before
this
act
was
passed,
in
so
far
as
the
nancy
hanks
wan
concern,
a
party
could
not
go
to
the
court.
he
would
do
one
or
two
things.
if
the
nancy
hanks
--
the
railroad
wanted
to
cutoff
the
nancy
hanks,
they
would
go
first
if
they
wanted
to
to
the
state,
the
public
service
commission
of
georgia.
if
they
didn’t’
get
relief
there,
they
could
go
under
13
(a)
2
before
the
icc.
he
could
not
--
a
private
party
could
not
go
to
court.
he
could
bring
a
complaint
before
the
public
service
commission
or
the
icc.
but
if
the
icc
decided
to
do
nothing
about
it,
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said
for
the
court
in
the
city
of
chicago,
it
was
no
right
of
appeal
of
that
decision.
so
before
the
act
in
terms
of
an
intrastate
train
like
the
nancy
hanks,
the
procedure
was
administrative
and
you
went
to
court
only
if
the
icc
took
the
matter
or
passed
upon
it
and
decided
for
example
that
it
wasn’t
going
to
discontinue,
then
and
only
then
there
was
a
right
to
review.
now
in
terms
of
trains
13
and
14
which
were
interstate,
what
happened
before
this
act
was
that
again
the
private
party
could
make
a
complaint
to
the
icc.
the
icc,
if
it
decided
not
to
investigate,
that
ended
the
matter.
if
it
decided
to
investigate
and
pass
on
the
merits
then
there
was
an
appeal
to
three-judge
district
court.
so
this
act
didn’t
cutbakc
--
cutoff
a
right
which
existed
before.
this
act
substituted
a
slightly
different
system.
now
here’s
what
happens
under
the
act,
if
it
is
a
basic
system
train
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
exactly,
designated
as
part
of
the
basic
system
which
means
that
it
is
essential
to
our
transportation
needs
in
passenger
train.
if
it
is
part
of
that,
no
discontinuances
can
take
place
until
july
1,
1974,
none.
after
july
1,
1974,
if
they
want
to
discontinue
a
train,
they
go
pursuant
to
13
(a).
and
they
go
before
the
icc
and
they
file
their
notice
and
the
icc
either
decides
to
do
nothing,
let
it
be
discontinued
in
which
case
as
this
court
has
said
there
is
no
appeal
or
it
decides
to
investigate.
it
makes
the
decision
on
the
merits
and
then
there
is
the
normal
appeal
through
the
court.
now
as
to
excess
trains,
that
is
trains
which
are
not
part
of
the
basic
system.
and
this
would've
affected
the
trains
involved
in
this
case.
they
weren’t
part
of
the
basic
system.
they
were
purely
excess
train.
in
so
far
as
those
trains
are
concern,
they
can
be
discontinued
at
anytime
with
two
exceptions.
there
has
to
be
a
30-day
notice
to
alert
the
public
so
they
can
make
their
plans
and
so
forth.
or
if
the
train
is
operated
continuously
by
amtrak,
picked
up
by
amtrak
and
operated
continuously
for
two
years,
it
becomes
part
of
the
basic
system
and
then
everything
it
relates
to
the
basic
system.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
is
the
notice
and
that
shows
congress’
clear
intent
you
see,
as
i
indicated
before,
it
recognized
that
there
has
to
be
still
some
more
paring
to
get
down
to
(voice
overlap)
what
we
can
support.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
exactly
and
sir,
let’s
assume
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
if
you
look
at
14
--
look
at
404
(b)
(2).
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
unfortunately
mr.
justice
,i’m
most
apologetic,
we
don’t
give
you
the
entire
statute
in
our
briefs
which
we
should
have.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
congress
didn’t
want
any.
no.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
would
you
like
me
to
read
it
to
you?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
sure,
40
(b)
--
yes.
404
(b)
(2)
says,
“except
as
otherwise
provided
in
this
paragraph
and
in
section
403
(a)”,
that
would
relate
to
the
two
trains
--
for
the
trains
operated
for
two
years,
“service
beyond
that
proscribed
for
the
basic
system
undertaken
by
the
corporation
upon
its
own
initiative
may
be
discontinued
at
anytime.
no
such
service
undertaken
by
the
corporation
on
or
after
january
7
--
january
1,
1973,
this
is
now
as
amended,
shall
be
discontinued
until
the
expiration
of
a
one
year
period
beginning
on
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
sentence.”
originally,
they
could
simply
be
discontinued
at
anytime
when
this
was
amended.
in
1973,
they
put
a
one
year
cut
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that’s
the
excess
service,
yes,
sir.
in
other
words,
let’s
assume
that
instead
of
these
trains
being
discontinued
when
the
act
came
into
effect,
let’s
supposed
that
amtrak
would
pick
them
up
which
it
could
have
done
and
answered
to
your
question
sir.
the
amtrak
could
have
decided
even
though
they
weren’t
part
of
the
basic
system
to
operate
the
nancy
hanks
in
trains
13
and
14.
if
it
had
decided
to
do
so
and
it
has
operated
a
number
of
trains
in
excess
to
the
basic
system
then
this
would
come
into
play
and
it
would
be
operating
them.
if
they
--
if
it
operated
them
for
two
years,
they
became
part
of
the
basic
system.
if
they
were
not
part
of
the
basic
system
and
they
wanted
to
discontinue
then
this
section
would
come
into
play.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
then
the
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
in
this
case,
it
was
just
prior
to
april
1,
1973
--
1971
and
the
central
of
georgia
gave
the
notice
that
on
the
effective
date,
april
1,
1971,
the
trains
would
be
discontinued
pursuant
to
404.
you
see,
the
statute
allowed
as
the
april
1,
1971
was
the
date
under
the
act
when
the
discontinuance
thence
forth
could
take
place
if
they
were
not
part
of
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
that
is
because
if
you
look
at
the
way
the
act
is
set
up,
it
is
pure
dichotomy
between
basic
system
trains.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
would
apply
to
these
trains,
that
is
if
–-
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
401
i
believe
that
this
is
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
sir,
it’s
a
very
complicated
act,
it
certainly
is.
well,
13
(a)
(1)
provides
that
any
railroad
discontinuing
a
train
here
under
must
give
notice
and
accordance
with
the
notice
procedures
contained
in
13
(a)
(1)
of
title
49
and
that
is
the
30
days.
the
icc
has
interpreted
that
not
as
calling
the
icc
into
it
but
simply
as
meaning
that
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
they
give
the
notice
provided
in
13
(a)
which
happens
to
be
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
of
excess,
but
they’ve
already
definitely
do
in
terms
of
the
basic
system.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir,
because
there
is
a
provision
i
think
its
802
which
says,
that
no
discontinuance
of
any
train
can
be
made
anywhere
except
pursuant
to
this
act.
in
other
words,
that
the
procedures
in
the
act
must
be
followed
as
to
all
trains
throughout
united
states.
the
main
point
though
mr.
justice
is
that
if
you
go
back
before
the
act,
you
will
find
that
there
was
simply
no
right
at
any
time
just
to
go
directly
in
the
court
prior
to
the
state
agency
or
the
icc
having
that
and
that
is
precisely
the
situation
that
they
are
trying
to
get
around
now
by
saying
they
can
come
in
before
the
icc
or
anybody
else
even
offered?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
yes.
the
attorney
general
--
it's
not
quite
the
picture
painted
here.
the
attorney
general
has
been
investigated
in
tremendous
number
of
complaints.
it
has
one
right
now
involving
the
penn
central
that
the
attorney
general
is
investigating
and
while
there
had
been
no
suits,
the
department
of
justice
has
a
man
who
follows
this
carefully.
there
are
continuous
reports
to
the
congress,
to
the
secretary,
to
the
president
about
the
operations
and
he
exercises
a
very
diligent
role
in
this
matters.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
then
the
attorney
general,
i’m
sure
is
authorize
to
bring
suits
under
the
act
could
go
in
and
perhaps
the
icc
itself.
i
don’t
know.
but
if
he
wouldn’t
--
since
he
would
not
be
following
the
act
--
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
since
the
act
specifically
provides
for
the
30-day
notice
and
since
he
would
be
in
effect
disobeying
the
act
then
the
attorney
general
would
have
the
obligation
to
go
in
and
make
sure
that
the
30-day
notice
was
given.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
exactly.
and
he
looked
at
this
and
decided
that
they
were
owrong.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’m
barrett
prettyman
and
i
represent
the
petitioners
in
this
case
which
is
hereon
certiorari
from
the
d.c.
circuit.
the
case
presents
rather
a
narrow
question,
namely,
which
parties
can
sue
for
alleged
violations
of
the
rail
passenger
service
act
of
1970,
the
amtrak
act.
we
claim,
petitioner’s
claim
that
under
the
statutory
language
and
pursuant
to
the
congressional
intent,
only
the
attorney
general
and
where
a
labor
agreement
is
involved,
employees
and
their
representatives
can
sue
for
these
alleged
violations.
respondent
which
is
an
association
of
railroad
passengers,
claims
that
anyone
who
is
injured
and
aggrieved
by
an
alleged
violation
of
the
act
can
bring
suit
to
federal
district
court.
that
really
is
the
only
issue
before
the
court
this
morning.
before
i
go
into
the
facts
of
the
immediate
case,
i’d
like
to
give
you
just
a
brief
background
of
the
act
itself
because
it
bears
on
the
problem.
this
act
was
passed
because
of
a
genuine
concern
on
behalf
of
the
congress
and
the
people
that
all
intercity
passenger
traffic
in
this
country
was
going
to
disappear.
in
1929,
there
were
20,000
passenger
trains
in
this
country.
and
by
1970,
there
were
only
360.
the
plain,
hard,
cold
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
passengers
in
this
country
simply
could
not
pay
the
high
cost
of
operating
this
train.
at
the
same
time,
congress
in
passing
the
act
did
not
intend
to
stop
all
discontinuances
of
trains.
quite
to
the
contrary,
it
recognized
that
some
additional
paring
was
in
order
if
any
rail
passenger
traffic
was
going
to
be
preserved.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
p-a-r
sir.
p-a-r-i-n-g,
paring.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
some
additional
cutting
down,
yes
sir.
therefore
congress
devised
a
rather
elaborate
plan,
purpose
of
which
was
instead
of
the
individual
railroads
hereafter
deciding
which
train
and
when
it
was
going
to
submit
the
icc
for
paring
down,
instead
the
secretary
of
transportation
would
construct
a
basic
system
of
passenger
service.
the
minimum
system
that
the
country
should
have
and
that
would
consist
therefore
of
all
essential
service
which
hopefully
would
be
preserved.
and
a
corporation
was
formed,
amtrak,
which
was
given
power
to
enter
into
contracts
with
various
--
to
railroads
and
take
over
their
passenger
service
to
be
funded
by
government
funds,
tickets,
and
the
railroads
themselves
paying
entry
fees.
the
corporation,
amtrak
would
operate
this
basic
system
and
would
either
operate
or
discontinue
the
excess
service
above
the
basic
system.
i’d
like
to
emphasize
again
now
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
not
to
preserve
all
passenger
service
but
rather
in
the
words
of
the
house
report
to
effect
a
rational
reduction
of
present
service
in
order
to
save
any
passenger
service.
when
the
act
became
effective,
the
secretary
of
transportation
did
designate
the
basic
system,
a
21-city
pairs
(p-a-i-r)
with
42
trains
running
daily
as
part
of
the
basic
system
as
it
developed.
when
amtrak
took
over
passenger
service,
it
actually
operated
originally
some
180-passenger
trains
and
today
that’s
up
to
a
198.
the
central
of
georgia’s
only
remaining
passenger
trains
just
prior
to
the
passage
of
this
act
were
the
nancy
hanks
between
savannah
and
atlanta
and
trains
13
and
14
between
albany,
georgia
and
birmingham.
and
these
trains
were
not
part
of
the
basic
system.
consequently,
notice
was
given
of
their
discontinuance
and
on
april
1,
1971
when
the
act
did
become
effective,
those
trains
were
discontinued.
however,
prior
to
that
the
respondent
here
brought
a
suit
in
the
federal
district
court
against
amtrak,
the
central
of
georgia
and
the
southern
railway
seeking
a
temporary
restraining
order
to
prevent
the
discontinuance
of
these
three
trains.
it
was
alleged
that
the
act
was
violated
because
of
the
relationship
between
central
and
southern.
southern
down
and
virtually
all
of
the
stock
of
central.
southern
itself
had
decided
not
to
enter
into
contract
with
amtrak.
but
the
central
of
georgia
had
and
they
claimed
north,
the
railroad
association
here
claimed
that
either
the
entire
railway
system
had
to
enter
into
a
contract
or
no
part
of
it
could.
no
subsidiary
could.
and
it
sought
a
permanent
injunction
restraining
the
parties
from
enforcing
any
contract
which
did
not
include
the
entire
southern
system.
the
district
court
denied
the
temporary
restraining
order
and
dismissed
the
complaint
on
the
theory
that
narp
had
no
standing
because
of
section
307
which
provides
that
if
amtrak
or
any
railroad
violates
the
act,
the
district
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
upon
petition
of
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
or
in
the
case
involved
in
the
labor
agreement
upon
petition
of
any
employee
affected
thereby
including
duly
authorized
employee
representatives.
and
the
district
courts
were
given
jurisdiction
to
grant
equitable
release
upon
petition
of
those
parties.
now
it’s
clear
that
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
held
that
there
was
standing.
that's
clear
that
congress
has
the
authority
to
limit
the
right
to
sue
under
an
act
of
this
kind.
this
court
has
so
held
in
other
cases.
so
the
only
question
here
really
is
whether
congress
intended
to
do
so.
did
it
intend
to
restrict
the
right
to
sue?
we
think
very
clearly
it
did.
we
just
take
the
statutory
language
standing
alone.
we’ll
note
that
it
doesn’t
provide
specifically
that
anyone
aggrieved
or
injured
can
sue.
it
does
not
even
provide
that
the
specified
remedies
in
the
statute
are
in
addition
to
other
remedies.
it
doesn’t
even
provide
that
the
specified
remedies
didn’t
extinguish
any
remedy
or
right
of
action
not
in
consistent
herewith
which
it
has
done
in
other
statutes.
and
instead,
specifically
names
the
persons
who
are
going
to
be
able
to
petition
the
court.
in
this
case
however,
we
do
not
have
to
rely
upon
the
words
of
the
statute
alone
because
there
are
some
very
specific
and
direct
legislative
history
that
goes
right
to
the
point
before
the
court.
in
the
original
draft
of
the
bill,
the
district
court
was
given
jurisdiction
to
sue
amtrak,
amtrak
alone
--
given
jurisdiction
when
there
is
a
suit
against
amtrak
alone.
upon
petition
of
the
attorney
general
or
in
the
case
involved
in
a
labor
agreement
upon
petition
of
any
individual
affected
thereby.
now,
you’ll
note
two
things
about
that.
first
of
all,
amtrak
alone
could
be
sued
and
secondly,
it
didn’t
say
anything
about
labor
representatives
just
the
employees.
at
the
hearings
which
ensue
labor
representatives
came
along
with
ten
proposed
amendments
to
the
act.
one
of
them
would
have
specifically
allowed
any
aggrieved
party
to
bring
a
suit
for
violation
of
the
act.
as
labor
spokesman
said
as
the
bill
now
reads,
only
the
attorney
general
except
in
cases
involving
a
labor
agreement
could
bring
actions.
now
the
secretary
of
transportation
who
had
a
good
deal
to
do
with
this
act
in
including
--
following
up
on
various
sections
of
it,
thereupon
wrote
the
committee
a
letter
addressing
himself
to
the
various
proposed
amendments.
and
he
said,
i
would
oppose
--
i
would
be
opposed
to
permitting
any
person
to
seek
enforcement
of
section
307.
now
thereupon
what
happen?
this
is
important
because
this
is
not
a
case
opassengers.
f
legislative
history
where
we
have
the
committee
ignoring
people
who
have
submitted
views
on
the
contrary.
the
committee
actually
did
make
specific
changes
in
the
bill.
for
example,
according
to
following
labor’s
wish
which
the
secretary
had
no
objection
to;
they
added
specifically
that
representatives
of
employees
could
sue
as
well
as
the
employees
themselves.
again,
following
labor’s
wish
and
the
secretary
thought
it
was
unnecessary
but
it
didn’t
oppose
it.
they
introduced
the
allowing
other
railroads
to
be
sued
as
well
as
amtrak.
in
other
words,
not
just
amtrak
alone
but
other
railroads
could
also
be
sued
under
the
act.
but
because
of
the
secretary’s
objection,
the
committee
specifically
refused
to
introduce
this
concept
of
permitting
all
aggrieved
persons
to
sue.
the
secretary
had
objected
to
it
and
the
committee
left
it
out
and
the
bill
was
passed
without
it.
it
seems
perfectly
clear
to
us
from
this
that
congress
intended
only
those
parties
that
were
designated
in
the
bill
in
the
statute
to
be
able
to
sue.
this
case
therefore
becomes
like
switchmen’s
union
and
montana-dakota
utilities
and
fleischmann
distilling,
and
calhoon
versus
harvey
and
so
forth.
the
cases
where
the
specific
remedies
which
were
mentioned
excluded
others
including
suits
by
aggrieved
parties.
in
addition
however,
there
are
very
important
policy
reasons
why
congress
left
out
aggrieved
parties
and
why
this
court
should
not
sanction
it.
the
secretary
of
transportation,
the
icc
and
amtrak,
all
were
given
very
unusual
authority
and
responsibility
to
fashion
a
workable
passenger
transportation
system
in
this
act.
for
example,
this
amtrak
is
supposed
to
make
a
profit
eventually
even
though
it
was
recognized
that
these
various
railroads
were
losing
millions
on
their
passenger
traffic.
so
it
is
a
very
complex
and
difficult
job
that
was
fashioned
here.
and
if
anybody
can
sue
the
railroad,
certain
things
are
clearly
going
to
happen.
for
example,
even
if
there’s
a
single
suit
in
regard
to
the
discontinuance
of
an
important
line,
you
are
going
to
have
delays
if
temporary
restraining
orders
are
entered
which
as
our
brief
shows
could
cost
literally
millions
to
amtrak.
but
even
more
importantly,
if
more
than
one
person
sues,
if
suits
are
brought
in
regard
to
a
single
discontinuance
in
alabama
and
then
georgia,
etcetera,
you’re
going
to
have
the
possibility
of
not
only
the
temporary
delays
of
one
case
but
you’re
going
to
have
possibilities
of
conflict
between
circuits
which
are
going
to
unduly
delay
the
discontinuances
that
are
clearly
called
for
by
the
act.
this
case
therefore
becomes
similar
to
halloway
versus
brist-myers
which
is
cited
to
the
court
in
our
reply
brief
which
interestingly
was
decided
by
--
also
by
the
d.c.
circuit
but
by
a
completely
different
panel
from
the
panel
that
decided
the
instant
case.
and
they
decided
that
the
private
party
even
though
aggrieved
does
not
have
a
right
to
sue
under
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
and
the
court
specifically
pointed
out
the
vexatious
litigation
that
could
ensue.
it
pointed
out
to
private
parties
may
institute
piecemeal
lawsuits
reflecting
disparate
concerns
and
not
a
coordinated
enforcement
program.
that
same
principle
is
precisely
applicable
here.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
i
hope
you
have
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i’ll
see
that
you
get
one,
(voice
overlap)
i’m
sorry.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
was
filed
about
a
week
ago.
finally,
to
allow
brief
persons
to
sue
here
simply
makes
no
sense
if
you
look
at
the
overall
plan
of
the
act.
right
now,
no
discontinuances
of
the
basic
system
are
allowed.
they
won’t
be
allowed
until
july
1
of
1974.
after
july
1
of
1974,
the
railroad
amtrak
if
it
wants
to
discontinue
a
basic
service
train
it
has
to
give
30
days
notice.
thereupon,
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
if
it
decides
not
to
investigate
under
section
13
(a)
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
that
is
the
end
of
it.
and
this
court
has
said
in
city
of
chicago
that
there
is
no
appeal
by
a
private
person
from
that
decision
not
to
investigate.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
icc
does
investigate
the
discontinuance
and
passes
upon
it,
an
aggrieved
party
can
appeal
that
ruling
to
the
court.
it
seems
to
us
clear
that
certainly
in
regard
to
the
basic
system,
it
makes
no
sense
whatever
to
allow
an
aggrieved
party
to
bypass
this
procedure
which
has
been
established
and
to
rush
in
to
the
district
court
with
an
original
suit
even
before
the
icc
had
a
chance
to
operate.
in
other
words,
so
that
i’m
clear,
a
notice
is
given
a
discontinuance
and
before
the
icc
even
gets
to
decide
whether
it’s
going
to
investigate
private
party
runs
into
the
district
court
and
brings
on
original
suit
and
wants
to
sue
because
of
the
discontinuance.
that
doesn’t
make
any
sense.
as
to
the
non-basic
system
track,
certainly
the
court
would
not
allow
a
private
party,
a
broader
authority
to
attack
the
discontinuance
of
a
non-basic
system
train
than
it
would,
a
basic
system
train
because
congress
has
specifically
provided
right
here
in
the
act
that
a
non-basic
system
train
can
be
discontinued
at
any
time
just
with
30
days
notice.
that’s
all
that’s
necessary.
and
the
congressional
will
having
been
expressed
that
you
can
discontinue
that
easily
a
non-basic
service
train,
it
certainly
makes
no
sense
to
allow
an
aggrieved
person
to
run
into
court
and
attempt
to
attack
it.
so
on
all
of
these
grants
it
seems
to
us
on
the
basis
--
the
statutory
language
as
it
stands,
on
the
basis
of
the
legislative
history
which
i
pointed
out
where
the
aggrieved
party
was
specifically
left
out
on
the
basis
of
the
public
interest
involved
and
seen
that
amtrak
can
really
operate
and
discontinue,
etcetera
and
finally
on
the
basis
of
common
sense
in
the
light
of
the
legislative
scheme.
we
think
that
clearly
that
district
court
was
right
in
throwing
out
this
case.
i
might
just
add
that
the
attorney
general,
the
responsible
official
under
the
act
agrees
with
us
as
expressed
both
in
letters
and
by
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
which
has
been
filed
before
the
court.
the
united
states
agrees
that
aggrieved
parties
cannot
sue
and
that
the
responsible
official
for
bringing
lawsuits
for
discontinuance
etcetera
is
the
attorney
general.
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
unless
the
court
has
questions.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
indulge
just
a
moment
because
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
thought
perhaps
--
yes,
i’ll
answer
that
and
track
it
through
for
you
if
i
may
just
quickly
refer
mr.
justice
white
to
403
(b)
sir,
there
is
a
specific
provision
if
the
community
and
the
railroad
and
amtrak
can’t
reach
an
agreement,
it
goes
to
the
secretary
of
transportation
forum.
now
let’s
go
back
before
the
act
was
passed
and
follow
this
through.
and
mr.
justice
white
raised
the
key
question
here,
this
act
is
not
cutoff
a
right
which
was
a
prior
right
which
existed
before.
before
this
act
was
passed,
in
so
far
as
the
nancy
hanks
wan
concern,
a
party
could
not
go
to
the
court.
he
would
do
one
or
two
things.
if
the
nancy
hanks
--
the
railroad
wanted
to
cutoff
the
nancy
hanks,
they
would
go
first
if
they
wanted
to
to
the
state,
the
public
service
commission
of
georgia.
if
they
didn’t’
get
relief
there,
they
could
go
under
13
(a)
2
before
the
icc.
he
could
not
--
a
private
party
could
not
go
to
court.
he
could
bring
a
complaint
before
the
public
service
commission
or
the
icc.
but
if
the
icc
decided
to
do
nothing
about
it,
as
mr.
justice
douglas
said
for
the
court
in
the
city
of
chicago,
it
was
no
right
of
appeal
of
that
decision.
so
before
the
act
in
terms
of
an
intrastate
train
like
the
nancy
hanks,
the
procedure
was
administrative
and
you
went
to
court
only
if
the
icc
took
the
matter
or
passed
upon
it
and
decided
for
example
that
it
wasn’t
going
to
discontinue,
then
and
only
then
there
was
a
right
to
review.
now
in
terms
of
trains
13
and
14
which
were
interstate,
what
happened
before
this
act
was
that
again
the
private
party
could
make
a
complaint
to
the
icc.
the
icc,
if
it
decided
not
to
investigate,
that
ended
the
matter.
if
it
decided
to
investigate
and
pass
on
the
merits
then
there
was
an
appeal
to
three-judge
district
court.
so
this
act
didn’t
cutbakc
--
cutoff
a
right
which
existed
before.
this
act
substituted
a
slightly
different
system.
now
here’s
what
happens
under
the
act,
if
it
is
a
basic
system
train
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
exactly,
designated
as
part
of
the
basic
system
which
means
that
it
is
essential
to
our
transportation
needs
in
passenger
train.
if
it
is
part
of
that,
no
discontinuances
can
take
place
until
july
1,
1974,
none.
after
july
1,
1974,
if
they
want
to
discontinue
a
train,
they
go
pursuant
to
13
(a).
and
they
go
before
the
icc
and
they
file
their
notice
and
the
icc
either
decides
to
do
nothing,
let
it
be
discontinued
in
which
case
as
this
court
has
said
there
is
no
appeal
or
it
decides
to
investigate.
it
makes
the
decision
on
the
merits
and
then
there
is
the
normal
appeal
through
the
court.
now
as
to
excess
trains,
that
is
trains
which
are
not
part
of
the
basic
system.
and
this
would've
affected
the
trains
involved
in
this
case.
they
weren’t
part
of
the
basic
system.
they
were
purely
excess
train.
in
so
far
as
those
trains
are
concern,
they
can
be
discontinued
at
anytime
with
two
exceptions.
there
has
to
be
a
30-day
notice
to
alert
the
public
so
they
can
make
their
plans
and
so
forth.
or
if
the
train
is
operated
continuously
by
amtrak,
picked
up
by
amtrak
and
operated
continuously
for
two
years,
it
becomes
part
of
the
basic
system
and
then
everything
it
relates
to
the
basic
system.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
is
the
notice
and
that
shows
congress’
clear
intent
you
see,
as
i
indicated
before,
it
recognized
that
there
has
to
be
still
some
more
paring
to
get
down
to
(voice
overlap)
what
we
can
support.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
exactly
and
sir,
let’s
assume
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
if
you
look
at
14
--
look
at
404
(b)
(2).
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
unfortunately
mr.
justice
,i’m
most
apologetic,
we
don’t
give
you
the
entire
statute
in
our
briefs
which
we
should
have.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
congress
didn’t
want
any.
no.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
would
you
like
me
to
read
it
to
you?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
sure,
40
(b)
--
yes.
404
(b)
(2)
says,
“except
as
otherwise
provided
in
this
paragraph
and
in
section
403
(a)”,
that
would
relate
to
the
two
trains
--
for
the
trains
operated
for
two
years,
“service
beyond
that
proscribed
for
the
basic
system
undertaken
by
the
corporation
upon
its
own
initiative
may
be
discontinued
at
anytime.
no
such
service
undertaken
by
the
corporation
on
or
after
january
7
--
january
1,
1973,
this
is
now
as
amended,
shall
be
discontinued
until
the
expiration
of
a
one
year
period
beginning
on
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
sentence.”
originally,
they
could
simply
be
discontinued
at
anytime
when
this
was
amended.
in
1973,
they
put
a
one
year
cut
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that’s
the
excess
service,
yes,
sir.
in
other
words,
let’s
assume
that
instead
of
these
trains
being
discontinued
when
the
act
came
into
effect,
let’s
supposed
that
amtrak
would
pick
them
up
which
it
could
have
done
and
answered
to
your
question
sir.
the
amtrak
could
have
decided
even
though
they
weren’t
part
of
the
basic
system
to
operate
the
nancy
hanks
in
trains
13
and
14.
if
it
had
decided
to
do
so
and
it
has
operated
a
number
of
trains
in
excess
to
the
basic
system
then
this
would
come
into
play
and
it
would
be
operating
them.
if
they
--
if
it
operated
them
for
two
years,
they
became
part
of
the
basic
system.
if
they
were
not
part
of
the
basic
system
and
they
wanted
to
discontinue
then
this
section
would
come
into
play.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
then
the
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
in
this
case,
it
was
just
prior
to
april
1,
1973
--
1971
and
the
central
of
georgia
gave
the
notice
that
on
the
effective
date,
april
1,
1971,
the
trains
would
be
discontinued
pursuant
to
404.
you
see,
the
statute
allowed
as
the
april
1,
1971
was
the
date
under
the
act
when
the
discontinuance
thence
forth
could
take
place
if
they
were
not
part
of
the
(voice
overlap).
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
that
is
because
if
you
look
at
the
way
the
act
is
set
up,
it
is
pure
dichotomy
between
basic
system
trains.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
would
apply
to
these
trains,
that
is
if
–-
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
401
i
believe
that
this
is
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
sir,
it’s
a
very
complicated
act,
it
certainly
is.
well,
13
(a)
(1)
provides
that
any
railroad
discontinuing
a
train
here
under
must
give
notice
and
accordance
with
the
notice
procedures
contained
in
13
(a)
(1)
of
title
49
and
that
is
the
30
days.
the
icc
has
interpreted
that
not
as
calling
the
icc
into
it
but
simply
as
meaning
that
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
they
give
the
notice
provided
in
13
(a)
which
happens
to
be
--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
of
excess,
but
they’ve
already
definitely
do
in
terms
of
the
basic
system.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no
sir,
because
there
is
a
provision
i
think
its
802
which
says,
that
no
discontinuance
of
any
train
can
be
made
anywhere
except
pursuant
to
this
act.
in
other
words,
that
the
procedures
in
the
act
must
be
followed
as
to
all
trains
throughout
united
states.
the
main
point
though
mr.
justice
is
that
if
you
go
back
before
the
act,
you
will
find
that
there
was
simply
no
right
at
any
time
just
to
go
directly
in
the
court
prior
to
the
state
agency
or
the
icc
having
that
and
that
is
precisely
the
situation
that
they
are
trying
to
get
around
now
by
saying
they
can
come
in
before
the
icc
or
anybody
else
even
offered?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
yes.
the
attorney
general
--
it's
not
quite
the
picture
painted
here.
the
attorney
general
has
been
investigated
in
tremendous
number
of
complaints.
it
has
one
right
now
involving
the
penn
central
that
the
attorney
general
is
investigating
and
while
there
had
been
no
suits,
the
department
of
justice
has
a
man
who
follows
this
carefully.
there
are
continuous
reports
to
the
congress,
to
the
secretary,
to
the
president
about
the
operations
and
he
exercises
a
very
diligent
role
in
this
matters.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
then
the
attorney
general,
i’m
sure
is
authorize
to
bring
suits
under
the
act
could
go
in
and
perhaps
the
icc
itself.
i
don’t
know.
but
if
he
wouldn’t
--
since
he
would
not
be
following
the
act
--
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
since
the
act
specifically
provides
for
the
30-day
notice
and
since
he
would
be
in
effect
disobeying
the
act
then
the
attorney
general
would
have
the
obligation
to
go
in
and
make
sure
that
the
30-day
notice
was
given.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
exactly.
and
he
looked
at
this
and
decided
that
they
were
owrong.
thank
you
very
much.
