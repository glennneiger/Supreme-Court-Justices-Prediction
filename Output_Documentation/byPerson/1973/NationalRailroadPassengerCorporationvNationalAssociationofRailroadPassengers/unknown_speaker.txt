unknown

that’s
p-a-r-i-n-g
or
p-a-i-r,
paring?
unknown
speaker
paring.
unknown
speaker
you
filed
it
with
reply
brief,
mr.
prettyman?
unknown

i
don’t
seem
to
have
it
here.
unknown

well,
i’ll
get
it
if
you
file
this.
thank
you.
unknown

does
that
have
anything
in
the
bearing
of
this?
unknown

well,
does
the
change
having
the
language
of
that
particular
statute?
unknown
speaker
was
was
changed?
307?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
does
it
--
like
any
change
(voice

unknown
speaker
did
you
make
an
effort
to
get
a
provision
in
that
to
give
you
a
right
to
sue?
unknown
speaker
i
interpreted
your
answer
to
be
no,
you
didn’t
make
any
effort?
unknown
speaker
were
--
but
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
position
at
all,
don’t
you?
unknown
speaker
the
opposition
is
that
the
language
you
figured
was
broad
enough
and
now
you’re
going
to
litigate
it?
unknown
speaker
instead
of
asking
congress
to
include
it?
unknown
speaker
that’s
a
certain
savings
clause
and
there
is
also
section
b
to
which
allows
other
remedies
beyond
the
amtrak
act.
unknown
speaker
mr.
macdougall,
ain
ordinary
circumstances
when
a
railroad
wants
to
discontinue
a
train,
what
does
it
do?
unknown
speaker
depending
on
what
kind
of
a
train
it
is?
unknown
speaker
let’s
assume
they
go
into
interstate
commerce
commission.
they
have
just
given
notice
today?
unknown
speaker
give
a
notice
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission?
unknown
speaker
and
then
what
happen?
unknown
speaker
and
how
long
does
it
have
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
and
the
train
goes
on
during
that
period?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
now
except
for
the
amtrak
act,
would
you
say
you
can
go
directly
into
the
court
prior
to
any
proceedings
before
the
commission?
unknown
speaker
discontinuance
are
still
subject
to
the
same
provisions,
aren’t
they?
you’re
going
to
--
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
if
a
--
unknown
speaker
but
what
about
a
company
railroad
makes
a
contract
with
amtrak
to
operate
certain
trains.
what
about
it’s
other
train?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
they
extent
it,
there’s
any
administrative
participation
in
the
discontinuance
process.
your
position
is
that
you
should
be
able
to
get
into
court
before
or
wholly
aside
from
that?
unknown
speaker
what
about
this
train?
unknown
speaker
it
was
subject
to
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about,
was
this
nancy
hanks,
what
was
it
subject
to?
unknown
speaker
did
the
railroad
give
notice
there?
unknown
speaker
to
whom?
unknown
speaker
could
the
icc
have
stopped
it
if
it
wanted.
unknown
speaker
but
that
service
would
be
picked
up
by
amtrak?
unknown
speaker
so
who
did
the
discontinuance?
unknown
speaker
amtrak
also
made
the
decision,
isn’t
it?
not
to
operate?
unknown
speaker
could
they
count
--
could
amtrak
have
operated
these
trains
if
it
wanted
to?
was
this
train
covered
by
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
yes.
could
amtrak
would
like
to
operate
on
these
trains
if
it
wanted
to?
unknown
speaker
it
could
have
but
it
didn’t?
unknown
speaker
all
or
nothing?
unknown
speaker
i’m
a
little
confused
mr.
macdougall.
is
it
your
position
that
assuming
your
basic
premise,
namely
that
it
have
to
be
all
or
nothing.
unknown
speaker
since
it
was
not,
but
then
southern
or
central
georgia,
it’s
wholly
on
subsidiary,
may
not
discontinue
the
nancy
hanks
unless
southern
does
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
it
wants
to
discontinue
--
oh!
you
mean
that’s
not
prohibition?
unknown
speaker
unless
meanwhile
may
they
contract
with
amtrak?
unknown
speaker
to
cover
all
of
the
–-
unknown

that
took
it
out
you
say
of
the
regular
discontinuance?
unknown
speaker
discontinued.
it's
been
--
it
was
discontinued.
unknown
speaker
i’m
pretty
sure
they
do
have
the
trains
in
this
(inaudible).
they're
operating
their
own
train
service
between
washington
and
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
macdougall
you’ve
been
very
responsive
and
very
informative
in
your
answer
to
questions
from
the
bench
about
the
merits
of

but,
do
you
agree
with
your
brother,
mr.
prettyman
that
the
merits
of
your
claim
aren’t
here
at
all,
that
what
we
have
here
is

the

unknown

whether
or
not
you
have
the
right
to

unknown

you
would
agree
with
him
if
that’s
the
only
issue?
unknown
speaker
for
purposes
of
this
issue?
unknown

what
if
a

wants
a

to
continue
or
the
amtrak
to
continue
some
local
service

amtrak
doesn’t
want

says,
well,
you
can
pay
for
our
lawsuits?
unknown

and
what
if
they
get
into
an
argument
about
that,
where
is
that
argument
to
be
settled?
unknown
speaker
that
provision
specifically
provides?
unknown
speaker
well
it
does
make
a
duty
--
put
a
duty
as
long
as
the
locality
is
willing
to
pay
for
the
lawsuits?
unknown

and
--
unknown

no
administrative

without
exhausting
that
you
wouldn’t
think
you
could
go

you?

you
say
there’s

mr.

precisely
what

the

one
designated

the

but
otherwise
all
it’s
required

was
the

you
were

when

you

is
this

is
there
an

in
