ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
respondent
marrero,
who
is
ineligible
for
parole
at
the
time
he
was
sentenced,
may
now
be
considered
eligible
for
parole
since
he
has
served
more
than
one-third
of
his
sentence.
now,
the
sentence
he
is
serving
was
passed
down
under
a
law
that
has
since
been
repealed.
the
law
was
repealed
may
1,
1971
and
the
repealing
statute
is
called
the
comprehensive
drug
abuse
prevention
and
control
act.
the
respondent
was
convicted
by
a
jury
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
on
two
counts
of
receiving,
concealing,
facilitating
141
grams
of
heroine
and
with
purchasing,
dispensing,
and
distributing
194
grams
of
cocaine.
at
the
time
of
his
conviction
in
sentence,
people
guilty
of
these
violations
where
faced
with
the
mandatory
penalty
of
five
years
at
least
in
jail
and
under
that
statute
that
within
existence
at
that
time
parole
was
not
available.
the
parole
that
we
see
under
18
u.s.c
4202.
approximately
one
year
before
the
passage
of
this
new
repealing
statute,
the
respondent
was
sentenced
as
a
second
offender
and
he
received
a
sentenced
of
10
years
on
each
of
two
counts
to
run
concurrently.
his
conviction
of
may
27,
1970
was
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
therefore,
the
responding
of
serving
his
sentenced
in
the
federal
penitentiary
at
lewisburg
pennsylvania.
on
february
24,
1972
a
year
and
nine
months
after
his
sentence,
respondent
file
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
pennsylvania.
he
alleged
that
the
statue
26
u.s.c
7237
(d)
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
his
sentencing
and
under
which
as
i
said
he
was
an
eligible
for
parole
was
repealed.
he
should
now
be
eligible
for
parole
having
served
more
than
a
third
the
sentence.
the
district
court
denied
the
habeas
corpus
petition
on
jurisdiction
grounds
but
judge
neill
and
in
the
district
court’s
opinion
and
by
way
of
dictum
said
that
the
new
statute
did
not
repeal
the
prohibition
on
parole
eligibility.
on
the
ground
of
the
prohibitions
of
penalty
preserved
by
the
specific
saving
clauses
of
provision
at
section
1103
(a)
of
the
new
act
and
under
the
general
provision
saving
provision
of
one
u.s.c
section
109.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed
and
granted
respondents
application
for
habeas
corpus
and
directed
that
he
be
released
within
60
days
unless
he
has
given
a
hearing.
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
jurisdictions
throughout
this
country
and
this
court’s
mandate
--
the
court’s
mandates
been
state
by
mr.
justice
brennan’s
order
pending
this
court’s
determination.
now
with
this
lay
date
after
this
case
was
set
for
argument,
the
respondent
having
served
the
government
with
memorandum
attacking
the
stay
of
the
mandate
issued
by
mr.
justice
brennan
on
october
25,
1973.
attempts
to
say
that
mr.
justice
brennan’s
order
was
an
abstract
order
and
that
mr.
justice
brennan
therefore
did
a
useless
act.
during
the
entire
five
and
a
half
months
since
the
mandate
was
issued
not
once
did
the
respondent
raise
the
ineffectiveness
of
stay
order.
in
fact,
he
recognized
its
validity
because
he
attempted
on
two
occasions
to
have
it
vacated
but
on
different
grounds.
everyone
else
recognized
the
validity
of
that
mandate
and
behaved
accordingly
including
the
district
court.
respondent
submits
that
mr.
justice
brennan’s
order
is
useless
because
he
doesn’t
maintain
some
words
that
incidentally
the
respondent
believes
maybe
magic.
some
words
that
mr.
justice
harlem
issued
in
the
panama
canal
case
when
he
state
a
mandate
and
those
words
were
“offer
the
proceedings
under
the
mandate
being
state.”
we
find
no
authority
for
such
a
construction.
mr.
justice
brennan’s
stay
order
which
is
on
page
14
of
the
appendix
is
as
follows
and
i
would
like
to
read
it
to
court.
it
is
ordered
that
the
mandate
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
from
the
third
circuit
in
case
number
72-1842
(b)
and
the
saying
is
hear
by
state,
pending
the
timely
filling
of
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
above
entitled
cause.
should
such
a
petition
be
so
timely
filed
this
day
is
to
remain
in
effect
pending
this
court’s
action
on
the
petition,
if
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
is
denied
this
day
is
to
terminate
automatically.
in
the
event
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
is
granted,
the
state
is
to
continue
pending
descending
down
of
the
judgment
of
this
court.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes,
and
i
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that's
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that’s
correct.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
he
is
still
incarcerated
in
the
district.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
no
sir,
not
in
any
event.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that’s
correct,
and
so
i
say
to
you
that
is
it
not
clear,
i
should
ask?
isn’t
it
clear
on
the
face
of
the
state
order
that
the
intending
effect
was
to
preserve
the
status
quo
of
this
case
until
a
final
determination
was
made.
we
cannot
even
respond
or
say
that
respondent
is
urging
form
over
substance
because
the
form
of
the
state
order
is
certainly
more
than
adequate
but
even
if
the
word
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
i
said
we
will
now
say,
you
can
urge
a
form
over
substance.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
the
respondent
is
still
at
lewisburg
penitentiary.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes,
third
of
his
sentence
has
elapsed
and
he
--
in
his
habeas
corpus
petition
he
has
set
that
out
that
he
has
served
more
than
a
third
of
the
sentence
that
was
given
him
the
ten
years
and
therefore
that
he
is
eligible
for
parole
because
of
the
new
repealing
statute.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
consideration
for
eligibility,
yes
right.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
no,
mr.
justice
stewart.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
everything
has
been
state
and
remained
in
status
quo
since
his
incarceration.
but
i
would
like
to
even
add
that
even
if
this
date
of
reform
had
to
be
changed.
this
court
felt
that
it
should
be
changed.
it’s
our
position
that
this
court
could
stay
to
mandate
a
new,
so
wish.
respondent
further
contends
that
the
stay
orders
of
no
effect
since
he
was
entered
after
the
court
of
appeals
mandate
issued.
these
two
is
without
merit
because
this
court
n
car
versus
marcia
and
in
that
now
casualty
insured
to
company
versus
flowers,
stated
clearly
that
the
fact
to
mandate
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
issued
does
not
defeat
this
court’s
jurisdiction.
now
in
discussing
the
basic
issue
concerning
whether
not
the
respondent
is
eligible
for
consideration
for
parole.
i
wish
to
refer
briefly
to
the
common-law.
under
the
common-law
when
a
criminal
statute
was
repealed
by
a
no
statute
or
was
amended
so
that
there
was
a
lesser
punishment,
the
defendant
could
take
advantage
of
that.
he
was
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
new
act.
unless
a
specific
saving
clause,
in
the
new
law
express
legislative
intent
to
the
contrary
or
as
the
general
saving
statute
contain
such
a
provision.
here
we
not
only
have
a
specific
saving
clause
in
1103
(a)
but
we
also
have
the
general
saving
clause
section
109
contained
in
1
u.s.c
providing
the
prosecution
for
any
violation
of
law
occurring
prior
to
may
1,
1971
shall
not
be
affected
by
the
repeal
of
the
former
drug
abuse
statute.
in
denying
parole
and
probation
consideration
we
are
held
i
believe
a
lot
by
the
case
of
united
states
versus
bradley
whether
the
offender
was
sentenced
after
passage
of
the
repealing
act
and
where
this
court
held
that
the
repeat
--
the
prohibition
and
the
repealing
statute
of
suspended
sentence
--
sentences
probation
and
early
parole
survived
the
repeal
of
the
1956
narcotic
control
act.
however,
since
none
of
the
offenders
in
the
bradley
case,
none
was
eligible
for
consideration
for
parole
because
they
had
even
began
to
start
serving
their
sentence.
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
section
4202
was
banned
was
not
settled.
it
was
only
settled
the
section
4208
was
--
did
not
ban
the
earlier
sentences
or
the
earlier
provisions
of
1956
drug
abuse
act.
we
submit
that
the
ban
on
section
4202
parole,
like
the
ban
on
section
4208
(a)
parole
certainly
survives
the
1956
statute
and
what
the
court
has
before
is
a
relatively
straight
forward
question
of
legislative
intent.
ineligibility
for
consideration
for
parole
is
covered
as
part
of
the
prosecution
of
the
offense
referred
to
in
the
act
saving
clause
and
as
part
of
the
penalty
for
the
prior
upon
including
the
general,
a
saving
statute
and
in
bradley
this
court
ruled
that
the
word
prosecution
in
the
saving
clause
was
held
to
include
sentencing
at
page
611
and
rightly
so
and
we
submit
that
it
also
includes
the
word
penalty.
in
the
responding
in
his
brief
at
page
4
and
note
2,
reference
is
made
to
the
effect
there
that
unfortunately
the
responding
does
not
possess
a
crystal
ball
to
know
that
the
sentencing
court
intended
for
him
to
remain
in
jail
for
more
than
three
and
a
half
years.
but
respondent
should
possess
and
certainly
what
the
sentencing
court
did
posses
was
knowledge
that
in
sentencing
respondent
to
10
years.
he
would
not
be
free
on
parole
before
the
mandatory
release
time.
when
the
judge
entered
the
order
and
entered
the
sentence
of
ten
years
that
was
not
only
part
of
the
prosecution
that
was
part
of
the
penalty
and
at
that
point
in
time
he
knew
that
when
he
sentenced
the
respondent
to
10
years,
the
respondent
was
not
going
to
be
eligible
for
consideration
for
parole.
but
determination
was
made
on
a
date
of
the
sentence
and
of
the
judgment.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
he
could
have
sentence
under
the
violation
at
that
time.
he
could
have
sentence
the
respondent
to
40
years
but
he
gave
him
10
years
to
10
year
terms
to
run
concurrently.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
he
had
no
discretion
whatsoever
because
under
the
statue
that
time,
it
was
mandatory
if
he
were
a
first
offender
that
you
will
receive
a
five
year
term.
to
a
second
offender
was
mandatory
that
you
would
be
given
a
minimum
of
ten
years
but
you
could
have
been
given
a
maximum
of
four
years.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
the
respondent
here
was
a
second
offender.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
there
two
counts,
one
of
them
as
i
indicated
of
concealing,
facilitating
the
heroine,
second
count
was
dealt
with
a
194
grams
of
cocaine.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes,
you
would
be
correct
to
say
that.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
well,
i
do
not
think
we
--
i
am
not
that
concerned
about
what
he
may
have
wished.
i
do
believe
we
can’t
say
what
he
might
have
wish
to
have
done.
all
i’m
saying
is
that
when
you
gave
him
10
years
he
knew
very
definitely
that
he
is
not
eligible
for
parole
also.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
he
was
not
free
to
do
so.
no
doubt
about
that.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
he
was
bound,
he
was
bound
by
the
law
as.--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
at
the
time
of
his
sentencing
as
we
contend,
we
are
still
bound
of
the
law
no
matter
what
the
individual
wish
of
the
particular
judge
or
the
respondent
might
be.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
we
feel
that
it
makes
no
difference
in
this
case
that
he
is
properly
before
the
court
in
the
habeas
corpus
position.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
and
in
his
incarcerated
in
pennsylvania.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
well
the
government’s
position
is
that
he
is
properly
before
the
court
and
we
have
not
pushed
that
position
that
it
got
really
to
the
merits
of
the
case
in
his
instance.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
in
this
court?
yes,
your
honor.
now
the
general
saving
statute
in
title
one
which
dates
from
1871
it
provides
in
very
broad
terms
that
the
repeal
of
any
statute
shall
not
have
the
effect
to
release
any
penalty,
forfeiture
or
liability
incurred
under
such
statute
unless
the
repealing
act
expressly
so
provides.
there
has
been
a
considerable
amount
of
discussion
in
the
briefs
concerning
the
words
penalty,
liability
and
forfeiture
but
in
the
reisinger
case
in
1888
which
consider
that
question,
the
court
applied
the
statute
to
this
criminal
case
where
the
statute
is
actually
been
repealed
before
the
indictment
was
returned
and
the
repealing
statute
itself
just
as
in
our
case
had
its
own
savings
clause
except
it
was
much
narrower.
it
applied
only
by
terms
to
saving
prosecutions
that
it
all
ready
been
commenced
at
the
time
of
the
repealer.
in
the
reisinger
case,
it
not
only
said
that
the
general’s
saving
statute
with
the
narrower
clause
prevailed
but
it
said
it
could
not
be
construed
as
being
in
conflict
with
the
narrower
statute
and
they
went
further
and
said
that
the
word
that
we
have
been
talking
about
penalty,
forfeiture,
liability
were
intended
to
be
synonymous
with
the
word
punishment.
we
take
the
position
that
this
consideration
or
this
denial
of
consideration
for
eligibility
for
parole
is
punishment
or
penalty
which
automatically
attached
upon
conviction,
as
part
of
the
sentence,
as
part
of
the
prosecution
and
that
the
saving
statute
of
section
109
and
specific
savings
statute
of
1103
prevent
the
offender
from
being
considered
for
parole
eligibility.
in
this
analysis
it’s
confirmed
by
the
legislative
history
which
is
covered
i
think
very
fairly
in
our
brief.
that
is
the
legislative
history
of
the
narcotics
control
act
of
1956.
that
history
has
expressed
a
strong
congressional
intent
to
punish
narcotic
pushers
severely
in
part
by
eliminating
parole
as
an
element
in
the
punishment
and
this
was
part
of
the
penalty
for
trafficking
in
narcotics.
at
the
91st
congress
in
volume
116
of
the
congressional
record
at
page
33650
congressman
anderson
of
california
said
and
i
would
like
to
quote
him
“when
an
individual
encourages
another
to
take
drugs
and
when
an
individual
sells
drugs
to
another,
he
is
torturing
that
person
and
ruining
that
person’s
life
and
we
should
have
no
sympathy
for
him.”
the
penalty
for
the
pusher
should
be
equal
to
the
misery
because
it’s
his
fellowmen.
the
new
statute
substantially
revised
the
elements
of
the
narcotics
offenses
and
the
applicable
penalty
provisions.
and
it’s
general
philosophy
was
summarize
by
congressman
greimel
in
the
same
congressional
record
only
at
page
33616
when
he
said
“
the
new
bill
expertly
combines
the
weapons
of
law
enforcement,
rehabilitation
and
research
for
massive
attack
on
the
drug
abuse
problem
in
the
united
states.”
by
supporting
this
legislation
we
will
give
our
law
enforcement
officials
the
tools
they
need
to
crack
down
on
the
organize
criminals
and
pushers
who
profit
from
agony
and
death.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist
it
was
a
complete
new
act.
it
was
a
much
broader
act
because
the
1956
statute
dealt
only
with
narcotics.
it
didn’t
deal
with
general
--
in
general
barbiturates
fundaments
then
that
sort
of
thing.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes
and
i
was
getting
to,
that
is
correct
and
i’m
getting
to
section
848
to
explain
how
that
still
of
its
in
and
ties
in
with
congresses
intent
to
severely
punish
the
pusher.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
but
really
it’s
a
new
provision
in
the
70
act
but
in
the
sense
it
has
retained
the
law
of
the
old
act
because
the
punishment
there
is
still
--
in
fact
the
punishment
under
section
848
is
even
much
more
severe
because
in
section
848
the
penalty
is
raised
for
the
first
offender
from
five
years
to
ten
years.
and
the
other
limits
are
raised
as
i
recall
to
life
to
prison
rather
than
the
other.
so
congressman
greimel
--
his
last
sentence
is
either
the
same
time
we
will
recognize
the
fact
that
those
who
are
addicted
to
drugs
are
innocent
victims
who
must
be
helped
and
not
punished.
under
the
old
law
ineligibility
for
parole
only
covered
offenders
involved
in
selling
or
otherwise
transferring
narcotics
and
did
not
apply
to
the
possessors
or
to
the
individual
abusers.
now
the
new
act
is
still
consistent
with
section
7237
(d)
in
retaining
the
punitive
approach
for
the
pusher
in
illegal
drugs,
this
is
down
straight
by
the
fact
that
the
ban
on
suspended
sentences,
probation
in
parole
has
been
continued
for
persons
who
engage
and
“in
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise”.
although
the
amicus
brief
at
page
6
claims
that
the
government
really
realized
the
harshness
of
848
and
therefore
it
hasn’t
brought
any
indictments
under
that
section
their
brief
is
in
there.
the
government
has
filed
several
prosecutions.
one
of
which
has
reached
appellate
level
and
that
case
is
united
states
versus
manfred
at
488
fifth
2d
588
where
the
convictions
were
sustained
and
the
constitutionality
of
section
848
upheld.
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
new
flexibility
in
the
1971
act
but
there
is
no
indication
that
flexibility
was
to
have
retroactive
effect.
despite
the
permissive
petitions
argument
that
the
action
taken
by
congress
in
repealing
section
7237
(d)
and
allowing
discretion
as
to
prohibition
in
parole
for
some
narcotic
offenders
was
not
primarily
in
expression
of
a
desire
for
leniency.
the
reason
was
really
much
more
programmatic.
the
state
of
goal
is
much
more
programmatic.
they
want
it
to
make
sure
that
people
who
were
pushers
were
convicted,
were
prosecuted
and
convicted
and
what
they
have
found
is
in
many
jurisdictions,
the
prosecutors
routine
at
about
bringing
cases
where
the
penalty
was
severe
and
maybe
the
trafficking
not
as
great
as
if
it
was
not
in
a
respondent’s
case
but
also
the
fact
that
the
jurors
often
did
not
wish
to
give
such
a
severe
sentence
and
sole,
therefore
several
guilty
people
or
people
we
might
want
it
to
prosecute
were
not
prosecuted.
so
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the
pusher
was
prosecuted
and
convicted.
it
is
also
evident
from
the
terms
of
the
congressional
intent
as
shown
that
the
no
parole
provision
is
a
penalty
from
the
view
point
of
the
convicted
defendant.
his
penalty
is
very
substantially
released
if
he
is
paroled
into
society
and
he
is
no
longer
incarcerated
behind
steel
bars.
a
convicted
prisoner
who’s
been
paroled
undoubtedly
also
believes
the
parole
constitutes
the
most
substantial
release
penalty.
i
think
we
be
hard
pressed
to
find
any
convict
who
did
not
view
the
unavailability
of
parole
as
a
penalty.
in
the
six
circuit
stated
the
view
point
correctly
in
harris
versus
united
states
at
426
fifth
2d
on
page
100
when
it
said
it
maybe
legislative
grace
for
congress
to
provide
the
parole
but
when
it
expressly
removes
all
hope
of
parole.
this
is
in
the
nature
of
an
additional
penalty.
under
both
the
old
act
and
the
new
acts
--
new
act,
petitioners
conduct
was
criminal
and
even
though
there
were
legislative
changes
made
it
is
our
submission
to
this
court
that
the
old
act
was
not
repealed.
we
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
an
error
when
it
reached
the
result
in
holding
that
violation
of
the
pre
may
1,
1971
drug
loss
are
not
to
be
punished
under
the
pre
may
first
statute.
our
position
is
that
if
the
time
the
crime
was
committed
the
law
in
effect
control.
at
section
1103
(a)
forecloses
consideration
for
parole,
eligibility
under
section
4202
just
as
it
does
in
4208
and
the
general
saving
statute
of
section
109
clearly
mandates
that
the
availability
of
parole
is
foreclosed.
thank
you.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
respond
briefly
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
respondent
is
considered
a
pusher
or
whether
he
was
an
addict.
from
the
record
it
is
shown
that
he
was
not
an
addict
because
he
attempted
to
obtain
sentence
under
nara,
the
narcotics
addiction
rehabilitation
act
and
he
was
denied
that
because
there
was
no
proof
that
he
was
an
addict.
pertaining
to
the
judge
who
said
an
addict
and
i
want
the
sentence
under
nara
that
was
denied
because
of
there
is
no
proof
that
he
was
an
addict.
in
addition
at
the
trial
level
there
was
some
evidence
introduced
that
the
respondent’s
apartment
was
used
to
cut
the
dope
into
whatever
side
if
necessary
and
several
others
would
come
there
to
get
there
share
and
that
dope
was
sold.
there
is
no
proof
in
the
record
that
told
that
mr.
--
of
the
respondent
was
an
addict
although
he
asks
for
a
treatment
under
nara
and
that
was
denied.
also
as
to
the
statistics
about
800
or
more
inmates
there
are
only
489
inmates
presently
incarcerated
who
was
served
one-third
of
their
term.
we
have
a
total
of
734
however
who
are
in
custody
under
the
old
act
but
only
489
had
served
with
their
term.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
respondent
marrero,
who
is
ineligible
for
parole
at
the
time
he
was
sentenced,
may
now
be
considered
eligible
for
parole
since
he
has
served
more
than
one-third
of
his
sentence.
now,
the
sentence
he
is
serving
was
passed
down
under
a
law
that
has
since
been
repealed.
the
law
was
repealed
may
1,
1971
and
the
repealing
statute
is
called
the
comprehensive
drug
abuse
prevention
and
control
act.
the
respondent
was
convicted
by
a
jury
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
new
york
on
two
counts
of
receiving,
concealing,
facilitating
141
grams
of
heroine
and
with
purchasing,
dispensing,
and
distributing
194
grams
of
cocaine.
at
the
time
of
his
conviction
in
sentence,
people
guilty
of
these
violations
where
faced
with
the
mandatory
penalty
of
five
years
at
least
in
jail
and
under
that
statute
that
within
existence
at
that
time
parole
was
not
available.
the
parole
that
we
see
under
18
u.s.c
4202.
approximately
one
year
before
the
passage
of
this
new
repealing
statute,
the
respondent
was
sentenced
as
a
second
offender
and
he
received
a
sentenced
of
10
years
on
each
of
two
counts
to
run
concurrently.
his
conviction
of
may
27,
1970
was
affirmed
by
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
this
court
denied
certiorari.
therefore,
the
responding
of
serving
his
sentenced
in
the
federal
penitentiary
at
lewisburg
pennsylvania.
on
february
24,
1972
a
year
and
nine
months
after
his
sentence,
respondent
file
the
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
pennsylvania.
he
alleged
that
the
statue
26
u.s.c
7237
(d)
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time
of
his
sentencing
and
under
which
as
i
said
he
was
an
eligible
for
parole
was
repealed.
he
should
now
be
eligible
for
parole
having
served
more
than
a
third
the
sentence.
the
district
court
denied
the
habeas
corpus
petition
on
jurisdiction
grounds
but
judge
neill
and
in
the
district
court’s
opinion
and
by
way
of
dictum
said
that
the
new
statute
did
not
repeal
the
prohibition
on
parole
eligibility.
on
the
ground
of
the
prohibitions
of
penalty
preserved
by
the
specific
saving
clauses
of
provision
at
section
1103
(a)
of
the
new
act
and
under
the
general
provision
saving
provision
of
one
u.s.c
section
109.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed
and
granted
respondents
application
for
habeas
corpus
and
directed
that
he
be
released
within
60
days
unless
he
has
given
a
hearing.
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
jurisdictions
throughout
this
country
and
this
court’s
mandate
--
the
court’s
mandates
been
state
by
mr.
justice
brennan’s
order
pending
this
court’s
determination.
now
with
this
lay
date
after
this
case
was
set
for
argument,
the
respondent
having
served
the
government
with
memorandum
attacking
the
stay
of
the
mandate
issued
by
mr.
justice
brennan
on
october
25,
1973.
attempts
to
say
that
mr.
justice
brennan’s
order
was
an
abstract
order
and
that
mr.
justice
brennan
therefore
did
a
useless
act.
during
the
entire
five
and
a
half
months
since
the
mandate
was
issued
not
once
did
the
respondent
raise
the
ineffectiveness
of
stay
order.
in
fact,
he
recognized
its
validity
because
he
attempted
on
two
occasions
to
have
it
vacated
but
on
different
grounds.
everyone
else
recognized
the
validity
of
that
mandate
and
behaved
accordingly
including
the
district
court.
respondent
submits
that
mr.
justice
brennan’s
order
is
useless
because
he
doesn’t
maintain
some
words
that
incidentally
the
respondent
believes
maybe
magic.
some
words
that
mr.
justice
harlem
issued
in
the
panama
canal
case
when
he
state
a
mandate
and
those
words
were
“offer
the
proceedings
under
the
mandate
being
state.”
we
find
no
authority
for
such
a
construction.
mr.
justice
brennan’s
stay
order
which
is
on
page
14
of
the
appendix
is
as
follows
and
i
would
like
to
read
it
to
court.
it
is
ordered
that
the
mandate
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
from
the
third
circuit
in
case
number
72-1842
(b)
and
the
saying
is
hear
by
state,
pending
the
timely
filling
of
a
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
above
entitled
cause.
should
such
a
petition
be
so
timely
filed
this
day
is
to
remain
in
effect
pending
this
court’s
action
on
the
petition,
if
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
is
denied
this
day
is
to
terminate
automatically.
in
the
event
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
is
granted,
the
state
is
to
continue
pending
descending
down
of
the
judgment
of
this
court.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes,
and
i
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that's
correct
mr.
justice
brennan.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that’s
correct.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
he
is
still
incarcerated
in
the
district.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
no
sir,
not
in
any
event.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that’s
correct,
and
so
i
say
to
you
that
is
it
not
clear,
i
should
ask?
isn’t
it
clear
on
the
face
of
the
state
order
that
the
intending
effect
was
to
preserve
the
status
quo
of
this
case
until
a
final
determination
was
made.
we
cannot
even
respond
or
say
that
respondent
is
urging
form
over
substance
because
the
form
of
the
state
order
is
certainly
more
than
adequate
but
even
if
the
word
--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
i
said
we
will
now
say,
you
can
urge
a
form
over
substance.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes,
mr.
justice
stewart.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
the
respondent
is
still
at
lewisburg
penitentiary.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes,
third
of
his
sentence
has
elapsed
and
he
--
in
his
habeas
corpus
petition
he
has
set
that
out
that
he
has
served
more
than
a
third
of
the
sentence
that
was
given
him
the
ten
years
and
therefore
that
he
is
eligible
for
parole
because
of
the
new
repealing
statute.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
consideration
for
eligibility,
yes
right.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
no,
mr.
justice
stewart.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
everything
has
been
state
and
remained
in
status
quo
since
his
incarceration.
but
i
would
like
to
even
add
that
even
if
this
date
of
reform
had
to
be
changed.
this
court
felt
that
it
should
be
changed.
it’s
our
position
that
this
court
could
stay
to
mandate
a
new,
so
wish.
respondent
further
contends
that
the
stay
orders
of
no
effect
since
he
was
entered
after
the
court
of
appeals
mandate
issued.
these
two
is
without
merit
because
this
court
n
car
versus
marcia
and
in
that
now
casualty
insured
to
company
versus
flowers,
stated
clearly
that
the
fact
to
mandate
in
the
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
issued
does
not
defeat
this
court’s
jurisdiction.
now
in
discussing
the
basic
issue
concerning
whether
not
the
respondent
is
eligible
for
consideration
for
parole.
i
wish
to
refer
briefly
to
the
common-law.
under
the
common-law
when
a
criminal
statute
was
repealed
by
a
no
statute
or
was
amended
so
that
there
was
a
lesser
punishment,
the
defendant
could
take
advantage
of
that.
he
was
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
new
act.
unless
a
specific
saving
clause,
in
the
new
law
express
legislative
intent
to
the
contrary
or
as
the
general
saving
statute
contain
such
a
provision.
here
we
not
only
have
a
specific
saving
clause
in
1103
(a)
but
we
also
have
the
general
saving
clause
section
109
contained
in
1
u.s.c
providing
the
prosecution
for
any
violation
of
law
occurring
prior
to
may
1,
1971
shall
not
be
affected
by
the
repeal
of
the
former
drug
abuse
statute.
in
denying
parole
and
probation
consideration
we
are
held
i
believe
a
lot
by
the
case
of
united
states
versus
bradley
whether
the
offender
was
sentenced
after
passage
of
the
repealing
act
and
where
this
court
held
that
the
repeat
--
the
prohibition
and
the
repealing
statute
of
suspended
sentence
--
sentences
probation
and
early
parole
survived
the
repeal
of
the
1956
narcotic
control
act.
however,
since
none
of
the
offenders
in
the
bradley
case,
none
was
eligible
for
consideration
for
parole
because
they
had
even
began
to
start
serving
their
sentence.
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
section
4202
was
banned
was
not
settled.
it
was
only
settled
the
section
4208
was
--
did
not
ban
the
earlier
sentences
or
the
earlier
provisions
of
1956
drug
abuse
act.
we
submit
that
the
ban
on
section
4202
parole,
like
the
ban
on
section
4208
(a)
parole
certainly
survives
the
1956
statute
and
what
the
court
has
before
is
a
relatively
straight
forward
question
of
legislative
intent.
ineligibility
for
consideration
for
parole
is
covered
as
part
of
the
prosecution
of
the
offense
referred
to
in
the
act
saving
clause
and
as
part
of
the
penalty
for
the
prior
upon
including
the
general,
a
saving
statute
and
in
bradley
this
court
ruled
that
the
word
prosecution
in
the
saving
clause
was
held
to
include
sentencing
at
page
611
and
rightly
so
and
we
submit
that
it
also
includes
the
word
penalty.
in
the
responding
in
his
brief
at
page
4
and
note
2,
reference
is
made
to
the
effect
there
that
unfortunately
the
responding
does
not
possess
a
crystal
ball
to
know
that
the
sentencing
court
intended
for
him
to
remain
in
jail
for
more
than
three
and
a
half
years.
but
respondent
should
possess
and
certainly
what
the
sentencing
court
did
posses
was
knowledge
that
in
sentencing
respondent
to
10
years.
he
would
not
be
free
on
parole
before
the
mandatory
release
time.
when
the
judge
entered
the
order
and
entered
the
sentence
of
ten
years
that
was
not
only
part
of
the
prosecution
that
was
part
of
the
penalty
and
at
that
point
in
time
he
knew
that
when
he
sentenced
the
respondent
to
10
years,
the
respondent
was
not
going
to
be
eligible
for
consideration
for
parole.
but
determination
was
made
on
a
date
of
the
sentence
and
of
the
judgment.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
he
could
have
sentence
under
the
violation
at
that
time.
he
could
have
sentence
the
respondent
to
40
years
but
he
gave
him
10
years
to
10
year
terms
to
run
concurrently.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
he
had
no
discretion
whatsoever
because
under
the
statue
that
time,
it
was
mandatory
if
he
were
a
first
offender
that
you
will
receive
a
five
year
term.
to
a
second
offender
was
mandatory
that
you
would
be
given
a
minimum
of
ten
years
but
you
could
have
been
given
a
maximum
of
four
years.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
the
respondent
here
was
a
second
offender.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
there
two
counts,
one
of
them
as
i
indicated
of
concealing,
facilitating
the
heroine,
second
count
was
dealt
with
a
194
grams
of
cocaine.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes,
you
would
be
correct
to
say
that.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
well,
i
do
not
think
we
--
i
am
not
that
concerned
about
what
he
may
have
wished.
i
do
believe
we
can’t
say
what
he
might
have
wish
to
have
done.
all
i’m
saying
is
that
when
you
gave
him
10
years
he
knew
very
definitely
that
he
is
not
eligible
for
parole
also.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
he
was
not
free
to
do
so.
no
doubt
about
that.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
he
was
bound,
he
was
bound
by
the
law
as.--
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
at
the
time
of
his
sentencing
as
we
contend,
we
are
still
bound
of
the
law
no
matter
what
the
individual
wish
of
the
particular
judge
or
the
respondent
might
be.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
we
feel
that
it
makes
no
difference
in
this
case
that
he
is
properly
before
the
court
in
the
habeas
corpus
position.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
and
in
his
incarcerated
in
pennsylvania.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
well
the
government’s
position
is
that
he
is
properly
before
the
court
and
we
have
not
pushed
that
position
that
it
got
really
to
the
merits
of
the
case
in
his
instance.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
in
this
court?
yes,
your
honor.
now
the
general
saving
statute
in
title
one
which
dates
from
1871
it
provides
in
very
broad
terms
that
the
repeal
of
any
statute
shall
not
have
the
effect
to
release
any
penalty,
forfeiture
or
liability
incurred
under
such
statute
unless
the
repealing
act
expressly
so
provides.
there
has
been
a
considerable
amount
of
discussion
in
the
briefs
concerning
the
words
penalty,
liability
and
forfeiture
but
in
the
reisinger
case
in
1888
which
consider
that
question,
the
court
applied
the
statute
to
this
criminal
case
where
the
statute
is
actually
been
repealed
before
the
indictment
was
returned
and
the
repealing
statute
itself
just
as
in
our
case
had
its
own
savings
clause
except
it
was
much
narrower.
it
applied
only
by
terms
to
saving
prosecutions
that
it
all
ready
been
commenced
at
the
time
of
the
repealer.
in
the
reisinger
case,
it
not
only
said
that
the
general’s
saving
statute
with
the
narrower
clause
prevailed
but
it
said
it
could
not
be
construed
as
being
in
conflict
with
the
narrower
statute
and
they
went
further
and
said
that
the
word
that
we
have
been
talking
about
penalty,
forfeiture,
liability
were
intended
to
be
synonymous
with
the
word
punishment.
we
take
the
position
that
this
consideration
or
this
denial
of
consideration
for
eligibility
for
parole
is
punishment
or
penalty
which
automatically
attached
upon
conviction,
as
part
of
the
sentence,
as
part
of
the
prosecution
and
that
the
saving
statute
of
section
109
and
specific
savings
statute
of
1103
prevent
the
offender
from
being
considered
for
parole
eligibility.
in
this
analysis
it’s
confirmed
by
the
legislative
history
which
is
covered
i
think
very
fairly
in
our
brief.
that
is
the
legislative
history
of
the
narcotics
control
act
of
1956.
that
history
has
expressed
a
strong
congressional
intent
to
punish
narcotic
pushers
severely
in
part
by
eliminating
parole
as
an
element
in
the
punishment
and
this
was
part
of
the
penalty
for
trafficking
in
narcotics.
at
the
91st
congress
in
volume
116
of
the
congressional
record
at
page
33650
congressman
anderson
of
california
said
and
i
would
like
to
quote
him
“when
an
individual
encourages
another
to
take
drugs
and
when
an
individual
sells
drugs
to
another,
he
is
torturing
that
person
and
ruining
that
person’s
life
and
we
should
have
no
sympathy
for
him.”
the
penalty
for
the
pusher
should
be
equal
to
the
misery
because
it’s
his
fellowmen.
the
new
statute
substantially
revised
the
elements
of
the
narcotics
offenses
and
the
applicable
penalty
provisions.
and
it’s
general
philosophy
was
summarize
by
congressman
greimel
in
the
same
congressional
record
only
at
page
33616
when
he
said
“
the
new
bill
expertly
combines
the
weapons
of
law
enforcement,
rehabilitation
and
research
for
massive
attack
on
the
drug
abuse
problem
in
the
united
states.”
by
supporting
this
legislation
we
will
give
our
law
enforcement
officials
the
tools
they
need
to
crack
down
on
the
organize
criminals
and
pushers
who
profit
from
agony
and
death.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
that
is
correct
mr.
justice
rehnquist
it
was
a
complete
new
act.
it
was
a
much
broader
act
because
the
1956
statute
dealt
only
with
narcotics.
it
didn’t
deal
with
general
--
in
general
barbiturates
fundaments
then
that
sort
of
thing.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
yes
and
i
was
getting
to,
that
is
correct
and
i’m
getting
to
section
848
to
explain
how
that
still
of
its
in
and
ties
in
with
congresses
intent
to
severely
punish
the
pusher.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
but
really
it’s
a
new
provision
in
the
70
act
but
in
the
sense
it
has
retained
the
law
of
the
old
act
because
the
punishment
there
is
still
--
in
fact
the
punishment
under
section
848
is
even
much
more
severe
because
in
section
848
the
penalty
is
raised
for
the
first
offender
from
five
years
to
ten
years.
and
the
other
limits
are
raised
as
i
recall
to
life
to
prison
rather
than
the
other.
so
congressman
greimel
--
his
last
sentence
is
either
the
same
time
we
will
recognize
the
fact
that
those
who
are
addicted
to
drugs
are
innocent
victims
who
must
be
helped
and
not
punished.
under
the
old
law
ineligibility
for
parole
only
covered
offenders
involved
in
selling
or
otherwise
transferring
narcotics
and
did
not
apply
to
the
possessors
or
to
the
individual
abusers.
now
the
new
act
is
still
consistent
with
section
7237
(d)
in
retaining
the
punitive
approach
for
the
pusher
in
illegal
drugs,
this
is
down
straight
by
the
fact
that
the
ban
on
suspended
sentences,
probation
in
parole
has
been
continued
for
persons
who
engage
and
“in
a
continuing
criminal
enterprise”.
although
the
amicus
brief
at
page
6
claims
that
the
government
really
realized
the
harshness
of
848
and
therefore
it
hasn’t
brought
any
indictments
under
that
section
their
brief
is
in
there.
the
government
has
filed
several
prosecutions.
one
of
which
has
reached
appellate
level
and
that
case
is
united
states
versus
manfred
at
488
fifth
2d
588
where
the
convictions
were
sustained
and
the
constitutionality
of
section
848
upheld.
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
new
flexibility
in
the
1971
act
but
there
is
no
indication
that
flexibility
was
to
have
retroactive
effect.
despite
the
permissive
petitions
argument
that
the
action
taken
by
congress
in
repealing
section
7237
(d)
and
allowing
discretion
as
to
prohibition
in
parole
for
some
narcotic
offenders
was
not
primarily
in
expression
of
a
desire
for
leniency.
the
reason
was
really
much
more
programmatic.
the
state
of
goal
is
much
more
programmatic.
they
want
it
to
make
sure
that
people
who
were
pushers
were
convicted,
were
prosecuted
and
convicted
and
what
they
have
found
is
in
many
jurisdictions,
the
prosecutors
routine
at
about
bringing
cases
where
the
penalty
was
severe
and
maybe
the
trafficking
not
as
great
as
if
it
was
not
in
a
respondent’s
case
but
also
the
fact
that
the
jurors
often
did
not
wish
to
give
such
a
severe
sentence
and
sole,
therefore
several
guilty
people
or
people
we
might
want
it
to
prosecute
were
not
prosecuted.
so
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the
pusher
was
prosecuted
and
convicted.
it
is
also
evident
from
the
terms
of
the
congressional
intent
as
shown
that
the
no
parole
provision
is
a
penalty
from
the
view
point
of
the
convicted
defendant.
his
penalty
is
very
substantially
released
if
he
is
paroled
into
society
and
he
is
no
longer
incarcerated
behind
steel
bars.
a
convicted
prisoner
who’s
been
paroled
undoubtedly
also
believes
the
parole
constitutes
the
most
substantial
release
penalty.
i
think
we
be
hard
pressed
to
find
any
convict
who
did
not
view
the
unavailability
of
parole
as
a
penalty.
in
the
six
circuit
stated
the
view
point
correctly
in
harris
versus
united
states
at
426
fifth
2d
on
page
100
when
it
said
it
maybe
legislative
grace
for
congress
to
provide
the
parole
but
when
it
expressly
removes
all
hope
of
parole.
this
is
in
the
nature
of
an
additional
penalty.
under
both
the
old
act
and
the
new
acts
--
new
act,
petitioners
conduct
was
criminal
and
even
though
there
were
legislative
changes
made
it
is
our
submission
to
this
court
that
the
old
act
was
not
repealed.
we
submitted
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
an
error
when
it
reached
the
result
in
holding
that
violation
of
the
pre
may
1,
1971
drug
loss
are
not
to
be
punished
under
the
pre
may
first
statute.
our
position
is
that
if
the
time
the
crime
was
committed
the
law
in
effect
control.
at
section
1103
(a)
forecloses
consideration
for
parole,
eligibility
under
section
4202
just
as
it
does
in
4208
and
the
general
saving
statute
of
section
109
clearly
mandates
that
the
availability
of
parole
is
foreclosed.
thank
you.
ms.
jewell
s.
lafontant
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i’d
like
to
respond
briefly
to
mr.
justice
marshall’s
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
respondent
is
considered
a
pusher
or
whether
he
was
an
addict.
from
the
record
it
is
shown
that
he
was
not
an
addict
because
he
attempted
to
obtain
sentence
under
nara,
the
narcotics
addiction
rehabilitation
act
and
he
was
denied
that
because
there
was
no
proof
that
he
was
an
addict.
pertaining
to
the
judge
who
said
an
addict
and
i
want
the
sentence
under
nara
that
was
denied
because
of
there
is
no
proof
that
he
was
an
addict.
in
addition
at
the
trial
level
there
was
some
evidence
introduced
that
the
respondent’s
apartment
was
used
to
cut
the
dope
into
whatever
side
if
necessary
and
several
others
would
come
there
to
get
there
share
and
that
dope
was
sold.
there
is
no
proof
in
the
record
that
told
that
mr.
--
of
the
respondent
was
an
addict
although
he
asks
for
a
treatment
under
nara
and
that
was
denied.
also
as
to
the
statistics
about
800
or
more
inmates
there
are
only
489
inmates
presently
incarcerated
who
was
served
one-third
of
their
term.
we
have
a
total
of
734
however
who
are
in
custody
under
the
old
act
but
only
489
had
served
with
their
term.
