that
in
bradley
i
think
that
the
court
looked
upon
ineligibility
for
parole
as
part
of
the
sentence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then
it
said
at
the
trial
court
acceleration
of
it
was
under
bradley,
the
trial
court
could
not
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
could
not
interfere
with
the
ineligibility
for
parole
under
the
existing?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
just
saying
the
reason
that
trial
court
didn’t
have
this
power
is
because
under
the
prior
law
he
didn’t
have
that
power.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
didn’t
have
power
to
interfere
with
ineligibility
for
parole
will
be
granted,
eligibility
for
parole
where
it
wasn’t
present
before.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that
but
the
prior
law
with
respect
to
parole
was
held
to
apply
in
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
its
then
ineligibility
for
parole
was
part
of
that
and
the
trail
court
could
interfere
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
you
the
court
said
it
was
leaving
the
question
open.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
could
not
be
right.
i
couldn’t
be
wholly
right.
