i
think
i
understand
you
of
this
ties
in
to
be
the
original

do
we
have
a
jurisdictional
of

here
of
this
habeas
and
an
application
was
far
all
the
other
than
the
district
of
incarceration
not
in
the
original
sentencing
court.
does
this
make
a
difference?

prevailed
in
some
of
our
jurisdictional
verse
appeared
before
that
the
application.
justice
william

can
avoid
it
here,
