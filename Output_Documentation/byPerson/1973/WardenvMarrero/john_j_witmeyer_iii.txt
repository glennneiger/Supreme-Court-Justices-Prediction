mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court?
having
heard
the
government’s
argument
i
believe
it’s
appropriate
for
us
to
step
back
for
a
moment
and
take
a
fresh
look
at
the
question
that
confronts
this
court
today.
and
that
question
is
whether
the
federal
government
can
presently
deny
mr.
marrero
parole
consideration
under
section
4202
of
title
18
despite
the
fact
that
the
only
bar
to
parole
eligibility
was
expressly
repealed
by
the
comprehensive
drug
abuse
prevention
in
control
act
of
1970
simply
because
mr.
marrero
was
convicted
of
a
pre-repeal
offense.
but
if
the
question
is
stated
in
another
fashion,
i
believe
it
is
whether
penal
authorities
can
deny
the
800
prisoners
and
mr.
marrero’s
position
eligibility
for
participation
and
important
rehabilitated
programs
provided
to
parole.
even
though
there
is
no
rational
purpose
to
be
served
by
that
denial.
and
in
answering
these
questions
there
are
i
believe
three
inquiries
that
should
be
made.
first
that
the
1970
drug
control
act
marked
a
rejection
by
the
congress
of
its
earlier
approach
to
the
drug
fall
in
this
country
and
did
it
represent
a
decision
that
in
effective
program
of
rehabilitation
was
essential
if
drug
abuse
were
to
be
controlled.
second,
with
considering
mr.
marrero
eligible
for
parole
effectuate
that
congressional
decision
without
at
the
same
time
creating
any
difficult
administrator
problems.
and
third,
does
the
language
of
the
four
applicable
statutes
allow
mr.
marrero
to
be
considered
for
parole?
let’s
consider
first
the
first
question.
what
did
the
1970
act
signified
as
the
congresses
plan
for
the
drug
problem
in
the
united
states?
i
believe
the
answer
to
that
question
is
readily
apparent
from
the
history
of
the
drug
fall
in
this
country
and
congresses
response
to
it.
i
think
we
all
know
that
congress
first
attack
the
drug
problem
in
the
early
1900’s
because
of
the
wide
spread
drug
abuse
in
the
19th
century.
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
perhaps
the
most
important
legislation
was
the
narcotic
control
act
of
1956,
the
statute
under
which
mr.
marrero
was
convicted.
and
in
1956
congress
reviewed
then
ongoing
drug
problem
in
this
country
and
it
concluded
that
you
take
a
very
harsh
approach.
it
adopted
a
system
of
mandatory
minimum
sentences
without
possibility
of
parole
and
it
decided
that
severity
was
the
key
to
solving
the
drug
problem.
but
as
we
all
know
14
years
under
the
1956
legislation,
so
the
drug
problem
in
this
country
grow
to
alarming
proportions
and
it
was
obvious
that
the
1956
approach
simply
did
not
work.
the
1960
saw
the
federal
government
begin
a
review
of
what
would
happen
with
its
prior
efforts
to
control
this
problem.
there
were
many
studies
undertaken
both
within
and
without
the
government
including
those
of
two
presidential
commissions.
the
criminal
commission
and
the
cast
in
that
commission
and
the
conclusion
of
those
commissions
and
of
many
others
was
that
rehabilitation
was
essential
to
solve
the
drug
problem.
and
congress
slowly
began
to
change
its
approach.
for
example
in
1966
it
adopted
narcotic
addict
rehabilitation
act
to
provide
a
method
of
treating
and
rehabilitating
narcotic
addicts.
in
1968
for
example
it
amended
the
community
mental
health
central
legislation
to
include
treatment
for
narcotics
addicts
in
mental
health
centers.
and
in
1970
congress
embarked
upon
a
comprehensive
revision
of
the
drug
laws
of
this
country.
congress
had
before
it.
evidence
of
the
need
for
rehabilitation
and
for
merely
rating
the
harsh
penalties
that
it
been
inflicted
under
prior
law
in
order
that
the
law
would
benefit
the
crime.
and
congress
also
recognized
that
under
prior
law
prosecutors
had
become
reluctant
to
prosecute
and
judges
and
juries
had
become
reluctant
to
convict.
now
these
important
facts,
facts
which
the
government
argue
show
that
in
1970
congress
merely
intended
to
amend
the
law,
to
make
it
easier
to
put
more
people
in
jail,
these
facts
actually
shows
something
much
different.
they
show
a
public
consensus
including
that
of
the
judicial
process
in
this
country
that
the
1956
approach
was
not
the
solution
to
the
problem.
they
represented
public
rejection
of
the
harsh
retributive
approach
and
it
was
consensus
so
strong
that
i
believe
respect
for
a
law
in
this
country
began
to
suffer
as
a
judicial
process
became
unwilling
to
enforce
the
law.
and
the
1970
act
was
in
response
to
all
of
this
facts
and
that
was
not
an
act
that
merely
amended
the
criminal
provisions
law
because
it
also
directed
the
development
of
treatment
centers
and
it
rehabilitated
programs
and
it
directed
further
studies
be
undertaken
into
the
drug
problem.
and
about
the
same
time
congress
enacted
the
drug
abuse
education
act
of
1970
and
the
comprehensive
alcoholism
in
alcohol
abuse
act
of
1970.
all
of
which
when
taken
together
show
a
complete
reformed
of
federal
legislation
and
the
federal
approach
to
the
drug
problem
in
this
country.
and
the
repeal
of
the
bar
to
parole
shows
that
parole
was
to
be
an
important
rehabilitative
tool
and
implementing
the
new
congressional
approach.
now,
congress'
determination
that
rehabilitation
was
essential
to
solving
the
drug
problem
is
further
reflected
by
the
drug
abuse
office
and
treatment
act
of
1972
and
that
act
contains
a
specific
congressional
finding
that
the
success
of
federal
drug
abuse
programs
and
activities
requires
a
recognition
that
education,
treatment,
rehabilitation,
research,
training
and
law
enforcement
efforts
are
all
interrelated.
and
i
think
the
answer
to
the
first
enquiry
then
is
congress
in
1970
did
reject
its
old
approach
because
harsh
sentences
reluctantly
imposed
were
now
to
be
replaced
by
a
vigorous
federal
program
founded
upon
rehabilitation.
the
next
question
then
is
how
would
considering
the
800
prisoners
and
mr.
marrero’s
position
fit
into
this
new
congressional
approach
and
the
answer
is
clear
that
it
would
help
effectuated.
as
this
court
has
already
recognized
in
morrisey
against
brewer
parole
is
one
of
the
most
important
rehabilitative
tools
in
our
federal
penal
system
and
rehabilitation
is
the
underlying
objective
of
the
1970
act.
considering
mr.
marrero
for
parole
effectuates
that
intention
and
poses
no
problems
because
the
parole
board
has
already
stated
in
this
case
that
it
can
easily
handle
the
800
applications
of
prisoners
and
mr.
marrero’s
position.
in
fact
the
parole
board
routinely
handles
many
more
applications
than
that.
the
board
has
also
stated
that
no
one
would
be
released
on
parole
unless
the
board
felt
that
both
the
needs
of
society
and
of
the
individual
prisoner
would
be
served
by
doing
so.
simply
stated
them
parole
eligibility
from
mr.
marrero
both
effectuates
congresses
new
plan
for
solving
the
drug
abuse
problem
in
this
country
and
what
according
to
the
parole
board
benefits
society
generally.
and
it
would
also
place
no
burden
whatsoever
on
the
federal
courts
because
prior
criminal
proceedings
would
not
be
re-opened
and
judicial
determinations
are
not
required
to
implement
parole
under
section
4202.
i
think
then
the
answer
to
the
second
enquiry
is
that
parole
is
consistent
with
congresses
plan
for
solving
the
drug
problem
and
no
rational
purpose
would
be
served
by
denying
mr.
marrero
parole
consideration.
this
then
brings
us
to
the
technical
statutory
interpretation
questions
post
by
this
case.
and
i
agree
that
this
case
is
principally
won
a
statutory
interpretation.
parole
in
the
federal
system
is
made
available
by
section
4202
of
title
18
under
prior
law
section
7237
(d)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
stated
that
4202
could
not
be
applied
to
certain
prisoners.
and
7237
(d)
was
specifically
repealed
in
1970
by
the
1970
drug
control
act.
the
statutory
interpretation
of
question
is
whether
that
repeal
was
rendered
in
effective
as
to
prisoners
convicted
under
prior
law
because
of
two
savings
statutes.
section
1103
of
the
1970
act
and
section
109
of
title
1.
the
correct
answer
i
believe
is
that
those
statutes
do
not
preclude
parole
eligibility.
in
fact
if
this
court
whether
conclude
otherwise
since
no
rational
purpose
would
be
served
by
ninth
parole
to
the
800
persons
and
mr.
marrero’s
position
then
if
this
court
held
parole
was
unavailable
it
would
be
required
the
confront
constitutional
questions.
since
there
is
no
rational
purpose
to
be
served
would
not
a
denial
of
parole
contravene
equal
protection
guarantees
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
is
the
california
supreme
court
held
last
month
in
the
case
of
ray
foust
is
not
denying
parole
to
drug
offenders,
a
violation
of
the
eight
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
that
constitutes
rule
and
unusual
punishment.
but
i
think
an
analysis
of
the
savings
statutes
shows
that
these
constitutional
questions
need
never
be
reached
because
those
statutes
when
correctly
construed
do
not
preclude
parole.
first
of
course,
the
operation
of
the
two
saving
statutes
must
be
evaluated
in
the
light
of
congresses
over
all
plans
in
1970
for
solving
the
drug
problem
and
accordance
with
--
and
in
accordance
with
the
well
established
rule
of
statutory
construction,
that
statutes
must
always
be
construed
to
effectuate
remedial
objectives.
the
first
statute
then
is
section
1103
of
the
1970
act
and
that
was
a
statute
designed
to
save
prosecutions
for
violations
of
prior
law
and
nothing
more.
now
this
court
has
already
construed
section
1103
last
term
in
the
case
of
bradley
against
the
united
states.
and
there
this
court
said
that
the
word
prosecution
as
used
in
1103
is
to
be
defined
by
its
ordinary
legal
usage
and
i
think
is
as
clear
from
this
court’s
decision
in
morrisey
against
brewer
the
parole
process
is
not
part
of
a
prosecution
in
the
ordinary
legal
sentence.
but
in
bradley
this
court
was
confronted
with
the
question
of
where
congress
intended
to
draw
the
line
in
not
changing
the
operation
of
prior
law?
and
it
concluded
that
the
word
prosecution
is
used
in
section
1103
precluded
the
trial
court
in
granting
probation
of
accelerating
a
parole
eligibility
date.
but
this
court
specifically
point
it
out
that
parole
under
4202
was
a
very
different
thing
and
respondent
submits
that
those
differences
are
with
applied
that
mr.
marrero
be
considered
eligible
for
parole.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
well
you
honor,
i
believe
the
similar
questions
are
raised
except
there
was
a
rational
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
construction
adopted
by
this
court
in
bradley
because
i
believe
it
was
rational
to
conclude
that
congress
did
not
intended
--
did
not
intend
that
1970
act
either
reopen
prior
criminal
proceedings
or
that
it
would
treat
unequally
persons
convicted
of
violations
of
prior
law.
and
if
either
of
those
or
if
this
court
had
allowed
a
trial
court
to
place
a
prisoner
on
probation
or
had
allowed
the
trial
court
to
decide
whether
to
accelerate
his
parole
eligibility
date
then
either
prisoners
convicted
of
violating
prior
law
would
have
had
their
eligibility
for
probation
or
the
question
of
whether
their
parole
eligibility
date
could
be
accelerated
in
turn
of
the
two
of
the
circumstance
whether
or
not
they
were
sentenced
before
or
after
may
1,
1971.
but
the
alternative
would
have
been
for
all
prior
criminal
proceedings
to
have
reopened.
not
only
placing
and
undo
burden
on
the
courts
but
also
in
the
face
of
the
probation
statute.
and
the
statute
allowing
acceleration
of
parole
which
states
of
those
determinations
must
be
made
at
sentence
--
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
i
think
those
reasons
gave
a
rational
justification
for
this
court’s
interpretation
in
bradley
but
none
of
those
reasons
is
present
here
today
and
a
case
involving
section
4202.
parole
under
4202
simply
creates
no
administrator
problems
whatsoever.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
no
your
honor,
i
think
not.
the
question
in
bradley
was
section
4208
and
that
concerns
a
trial
court’s
acceleration
of
the
parole
eligibility
date.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
well,
he
could
not
exercise
his
discretion
that
was
granted
to
him
under
section
4202
to
accelerate
the
eligibility
date.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
yes
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
well,
i
think
that
mischaracterizes
the
parole
process
your
honor.
under
4208
the
trial
judge
can
accelerate
the
parole
eligibility
date
but
parole
itself
is
granted
by
section
4202
and
the
trial
judge
can
appeal
with
that.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
your
honor,
i
believed
what
this
court
said
was
those
decisions
of
the
trial
court
which
were
made
at
the
time
of
sentencing
and
therefore,
were
essentially
part
of
the
sentencing
process
were
caught
by
the
word
prosecution
is
used
in
1103.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
your
honor
again,
i
think
not
because
what
this
court
said
was
the
trial
court
could
not
accelerate.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
yes.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
well
your
honor,
i
think
perhaps
the
problem
is
the
government’s
argument
and
that
the
argument
your
honor
is
directing
himself
to.
is
that
the
word
prosecution
may
preclude
parole
because
the
date
of
parole
eligibility
depends
on
the
length
of
sentence
and
sentence
is
set
by
a
trial
court
and
i
guess
that
would
be
the
essence
of
the
government’s
argument
is
to
why
prosecution
catches
parole
ineligibility.but
i
think
the
relationship
of
parole
under
4202
to
sentence
is
only
incidental.
it
exists
only
because
congress
elected
to
use
the
length
of
sentence
as
one
of
the
criteria
for
determining
whether
a
prisoner
should
be
released
on
parole.
i
believe
that
eligibility
for
parole
itself
is
a
feature
of
statute
created
by
the
congress.
parole
is
determined
by
the
administrative
body
and
whether
one
is
eligible
for
parole
is
a
question
only
of
a
person’s
status
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
it
does
not
involve
an
exercise
of
judicial
discretion
by
a
trial
court
in
making
any
specific
determination.
i
believe
them
the
fact
is
that
the
word
prosecution
does
not
preclude
parole
eligibility
and
that
section
7237
(d)
is
not
saved
by
1103
and
that
conclusion
effectuates
the
rehabilitative
purpose
intended
by
congress
in
enacting
the
1971.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
your
honor
--
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
it
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
yes,
your
honor
because
congress
--
the
government’s
argument
in
--
with
respect
to
congressional
intent
rest
largely
on
section
848.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
your
honor,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
your
honor,
the
penal
authorities
have
many
programs
including
those
of
parole
but
prisoners
are
placed
in
supervised
environments
are
given
jobs,
or
given
training.
the
parole
board
is
the
board
which
evaluates
whether
these
programs
will
be
effective
in
adopting
a
prisoner
to
fit
back
into
society.
now,
i’m
not
going
to
infringe
my
view
on
their
judgment
because
i
have
never
been
involved
in
a
parole
process
but
i
think
it’s
recognized
as
a
principle
of
penology
that
most
prisoners
can
be
rehabilitated
if
they
are
placed
in
a
proper
environment
to
do
so
and
the
parole
board
is
one
of
the
important
mechanisms
or
accomplish
in
that.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
your
honor
i
think
it
is.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
your
honor
it’s
very
hard
to
say
what
the
board
pusher
means.
the
only
case
--
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
well,
then
i
think
the
statute
clearly
intends
that
many
of

the

also

namely

yes,
your

that’s
correct.
mr.
john

it
was
to
rehabilitate
the
individual
who
sells
drugs
either
because
he
is
a
user

because
he
is
an
addict
or
because
he’s
in
powers
and
he
is
selling
to
a
small
group
of
people
and
he
is
the
kind
of
person
that
hopefully
society
can
salvage
and
make
a
useful
person
again.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
there
are
no
facts,
and
a
record
on
this
case
and
i
am
not
familiar
with
mr.
marrero
personally
to
be
able
to
find
out.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
he
was
apprehended
according
to
the
second
circuit
opinion
on
a
roof
of
a
building
in
west
harlem,
new
york
in
which
they
found
drugs
and
he
was
the
owner
of
the
apartment.
beyond
that
i
do
not
know
specifically
what
he
is
ever
done.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
yet,
he
was
convicted
in
one
other
instance
of
possessing
drugs.
yes
your
honor.
it
does
not
say
whether
he
is
a
user
or
an
addict
or
a
pusher.
i
really
do
not
know.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
that
it’s
probably
was
selling.
yes,
your
honor.
your
honor,
i
think
that
one
remaining
question
facing
this
then
today
is
section
109
of
title
one
which
is
the
general
federal
savings
statute.
but
i
think
before
considering
the
operation
of
section
109
is
necessary
determined
whether
it
should
be
applied
at
all
in
this
case.
and
i
believe
the
answer
is
109
should
not
be
applied
for
two
reasons.
first,
section
109
originally
enacted
in
1871
was
intended
only
to
aviate
the
need
for
including
a
specific
savings
clause
and
every
repealing
statute
in
order
to
preclude
what
are
called
common
law
technical
abatements.
i
think
it’s
evident
from
the
history
of
the
1871
act
that
that
act
was
not
intended
to
substantially
change
the
law
or
to
a
rack
substantial
impediments
to
effectuating
remedial
statutes.
and
in
this
case
the
1970
drug
control
act
has
its
own
savings
clause
section
1103.
and
1103
specifically
limited
to
prosecutions
and
nothing
more
and
1103
in
compresses
all
violations
of
prior
law.
if
109
covers
more
than
1103
then
these
two
statutes
are
clearly
in
conflict
and
1103
as
the
latest
expression
on
the
legislative
will,
should
prevail.
second,
allowing
parole
eligibility
is
not
the
consequence
of
a
technical
abatement
as
the
term
was
used
to
common
law
and
since
i
believe
the
purpose
of
109
is
to
prevent
technical
abatements
applying
109
to
preclude
parole
eligibility
would
not
effectuate
its
purpose.
and
for
these
reasons
109
should
not
be
applied
at
all.
but
even
if
this
court
does
decide
to
reach
the
question
of
the
actual
operation
of
109,
the
conclusion
still
is
that
it
does
not
preclude
parole
eligibility.
the
effect
to
section
109
in
this
case
depends
upon
the
meaning
of
two
words
used
in
that
statute.
one
is
prosecution
the
other
is
penalty.
since
prosecution
is
used
in
section
1103
does
not
preclude
parole
then
is
used
in
109
it
should
not
do
so
either.
the
question
then
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
“penalty”
as
used
in
109
and
i
believe
there
are
three
reasons
why
the
term
penalty
does
not
bar
parole.
first,
section
109
is
written
in
two
parallel
clauses.
one
refers
to
sustaining
prosecutions
and
the
other
to
releasing
their
extinguishing
penalties.
these
two
clauses
were
clearly
written
in
parallel
and
therefore
should
be
construed
consistent
with
each
other,
each
thus
saving
the
same
kinds
of
things,
if
prosecution
does
not
bar
parole
then
neither
does
penalty.
second,
in
a
criminal
case
as
five
circuits
have
all
ready
decided
i
believe
the
word
“penalty”
as
used
in
109
should
be
interpreted
to
mean
the
imposed
sentence
of
the
trial
court.
but
parole
under
4202
is
not
a
part
of
sentence.
and
release
on
parole
would
not
even
affect
and
impose
sentence
and
consequently
for
that
reason
also
the
term
penalty
should
not
bar
parole.
and
third,
if
the
word
penalty
bars
parole
then
not
same
word
picks
up
numerous
other
collateral
restraints
imposed
upon
convicts
under
federal
law.
and
no
practical
purpose
would
be
served
by
requiring
congress
to
include
language
accepting
amendments
to
any
of
those
statutes
from
the
effect
of
109.
the
answer
to
the
third
enquiry
then
i
think
is
that
the
language
of
the
applicable
statutes
permits
parole
eligibility
and
the
conclusion
is
then
that
the
technical
and
i
believe
purposeless
construction
urged
by
the
government
ought
to
be
rejected
because
congress
is
now
designed
a
comprehensive
plan
for
attacking
the
drug
problem
in
this
country
and
rehabilitative
programs
are
the
cornerstones
of
the
congressional
plan.
considering
mr.
marrero
and
the
800
other
prisoners
in
his
position
eligible
for
participation
and
the
important
rehabilitative
programs
that
parole
provides,
helps
effectuate
congresses
plan
for
solving
the
drug
problem
in
this
country
and
there
is
simply
no
justification
for
abandoning
these
800
prisoners.
for
condemning
them
to
serve
their
terms
without
access
to
import
rehabilitative
programs
and
for
frustrating
the
basic
purpose
of
the
1970
act.
for
this
court
to
exclude
mr.
marrero
from
parole
consideration
would
be
for
it
to
adopt
a
vindictive
approach
to
the
drug
problem
and
approach
which
congress
has
rejected
and
which
cannot
be
justified.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court?
having
heard
the
government’s
argument
i
believe
it’s
appropriate
for
us
to
step
back
for
a
moment
and
take
a
fresh
look
at
the
question
that
confronts
this
court
today.
and
that
question
is
whether
the
federal
government
can
presently
deny
mr.
marrero
parole
consideration
under
section
4202
of
title
18
despite
the
fact
that
the
only
bar
to
parole
eligibility
was
expressly
repealed
by
the
comprehensive
drug
abuse
prevention
in
control
act
of
1970
simply
because
mr.
marrero
was
convicted
of
a
pre-repeal
offense.
but
if
the
question
is
stated
in
another
fashion,
i
believe
it
is
whether
penal
authorities
can
deny
the
800
prisoners
and
mr.
marrero’s
position
eligibility
for
participation
and
important
rehabilitated
programs
provided
to
parole.
even
though
there
is
no
rational
purpose
to
be
served
by
that
denial.
and
in
answering
these
questions
there
are
i
believe
three
inquiries
that
should
be
made.
first
that
the
1970
drug
control
act
marked
a
rejection
by
the
congress
of
its
earlier
approach
to
the
drug
fall
in
this
country
and
did
it
represent
a
decision
that
in
effective
program
of
rehabilitation
was
essential
if
drug
abuse
were
to
be
controlled.
second,
with
considering
mr.
marrero
eligible
for
parole
effectuate
that
congressional
decision
without
at
the
same
time
creating
any
difficult
administrator
problems.
and
third,
does
the
language
of
the
four
applicable
statutes
allow
mr.
marrero
to
be
considered
for
parole?
let’s
consider
first
the
first
question.
what
did
the
1970
act
signified
as
the
congresses
plan
for
the
drug
problem
in
the
united
states?
i
believe
the
answer
to
that
question
is
readily
apparent
from
the
history
of
the
drug
fall
in
this
country
and
congresses
response
to
it.
i
think
we
all
know
that
congress
first
attack
the
drug
problem
in
the
early
1900’s
because
of
the
wide
spread
drug
abuse
in
the
19th
century.
but
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
perhaps
the
most
important
legislation
was
the
narcotic
control
act
of
1956,
the
statute
under
which
mr.
marrero
was
convicted.
and
in
1956
congress
reviewed
then
ongoing
drug
problem
in
this
country
and
it
concluded
that
you
take
a
very
harsh
approach.
it
adopted
a
system
of
mandatory
minimum
sentences
without
possibility
of
parole
and
it
decided
that
severity
was
the
key
to
solving
the
drug
problem.
but
as
we
all
know
14
years
under
the
1956
legislation,
so
the
drug
problem
in
this
country
grow
to
alarming
proportions
and
it
was
obvious
that
the
1956
approach
simply
did
not
work.
the
1960
saw
the
federal
government
begin
a
review
of
what
would
happen
with
its
prior
efforts
to
control
this
problem.
there
were
many
studies
undertaken
both
within
and
without
the
government
including
those
of
two
presidential
commissions.
the
criminal
commission
and
the
cast
in
that
commission
and
the
conclusion
of
those
commissions
and
of
many
others
was
that
rehabilitation
was
essential
to
solve
the
drug
problem.
and
congress
slowly
began
to
change
its
approach.
for
example
in
1966
it
adopted
narcotic
addict
rehabilitation
act
to
provide
a
method
of
treating
and
rehabilitating
narcotic
addicts.
in
1968
for
example
it
amended
the
community
mental
health
central
legislation
to
include
treatment
for
narcotics
addicts
in
mental
health
centers.
and
in
1970
congress
embarked
upon
a
comprehensive
revision
of
the
drug
laws
of
this
country.
congress
had
before
it.
evidence
of
the
need
for
rehabilitation
and
for
merely
rating
the
harsh
penalties
that
it
been
inflicted
under
prior
law
in
order
that
the
law
would
benefit
the
crime.
and
congress
also
recognized
that
under
prior
law
prosecutors
had
become
reluctant
to
prosecute
and
judges
and
juries
had
become
reluctant
to
convict.
now
these
important
facts,
facts
which
the
government
argue
show
that
in
1970
congress
merely
intended
to
amend
the
law,
to
make
it
easier
to
put
more
people
in
jail,
these
facts
actually
shows
something
much
different.
they
show
a
public
consensus
including
that
of
the
judicial
process
in
this
country
that
the
1956
approach
was
not
the
solution
to
the
problem.
they
represented
public
rejection
of
the
harsh
retributive
approach
and
it
was
consensus
so
strong
that
i
believe
respect
for
a
law
in
this
country
began
to
suffer
as
a
judicial
process
became
unwilling
to
enforce
the
law.
and
the
1970
act
was
in
response
to
all
of
this
facts
and
that
was
not
an
act
that
merely
amended
the
criminal
provisions
law
because
it
also
directed
the
development
of
treatment
centers
and
it
rehabilitated
programs
and
it
directed
further
studies
be
undertaken
into
the
drug
problem.
and
about
the
same
time
congress
enacted
the
drug
abuse
education
act
of
1970
and
the
comprehensive
alcoholism
in
alcohol
abuse
act
of
1970.
all
of
which
when
taken
together
show
a
complete
reformed
of
federal
legislation
and
the
federal
approach
to
the
drug
problem
in
this
country.
and
the
repeal
of
the
bar
to
parole
shows
that
parole
was
to
be
an
important
rehabilitative
tool
and
implementing
the
new
congressional
approach.
now,
congress'
determination
that
rehabilitation
was
essential
to
solving
the
drug
problem
is
further
reflected
by
the
drug
abuse
office
and
treatment
act
of
1972
and
that
act
contains
a
specific
congressional
finding
that
the
success
of
federal
drug
abuse
programs
and
activities
requires
a
recognition
that
education,
treatment,
rehabilitation,
research,
training
and
law
enforcement
efforts
are
all
interrelated.
and
i
think
the
answer
to
the
first
enquiry
then
is
congress
in
1970
did
reject
its
old
approach
because
harsh
sentences
reluctantly
imposed
were
now
to
be
replaced
by
a
vigorous
federal
program
founded
upon
rehabilitation.
the
next
question
then
is
how
would
considering
the
800
prisoners
and
mr.
marrero’s
position
fit
into
this
new
congressional
approach
and
the
answer
is
clear
that
it
would
help
effectuated.
as
this
court
has
already
recognized
in
morrisey
against
brewer
parole
is
one
of
the
most
important
rehabilitative
tools
in
our
federal
penal
system
and
rehabilitation
is
the
underlying
objective
of
the
1970
act.
considering
mr.
marrero
for
parole
effectuates
that
intention
and
poses
no
problems
because
the
parole
board
has
already
stated
in
this
case
that
it
can
easily
handle
the
800
applications
of
prisoners
and
mr.
marrero’s
position.
in
fact
the
parole
board
routinely
handles
many
more
applications
than
that.
the
board
has
also
stated
that
no
one
would
be
released
on
parole
unless
the
board
felt
that
both
the
needs
of
society
and
of
the
individual
prisoner
would
be
served
by
doing
so.
simply
stated
them
parole
eligibility
from
mr.
marrero
both
effectuates
congresses
new
plan
for
solving
the
drug
abuse
problem
in
this
country
and
what
according
to
the
parole
board
benefits
society
generally.
and
it
would
also
place
no
burden
whatsoever
on
the
federal
courts
because
prior
criminal
proceedings
would
not
be
re-opened
and
judicial
determinations
are
not
required
to
implement
parole
under
section
4202.
i
think
then
the
answer
to
the
second
enquiry
is
that
parole
is
consistent
with
congresses
plan
for
solving
the
drug
problem
and
no
rational
purpose
would
be
served
by
denying
mr.
marrero
parole
consideration.
this
then
brings
us
to
the
technical
statutory
interpretation
questions
post
by
this
case.
and
i
agree
that
this
case
is
principally
won
a
statutory
interpretation.
parole
in
the
federal
system
is
made
available
by
section
4202
of
title
18
under
prior
law
section
7237
(d)
of
the
internal
revenue
code
stated
that
4202
could
not
be
applied
to
certain
prisoners.
and
7237
(d)
was
specifically
repealed
in
1970
by
the
1970
drug
control
act.
the
statutory
interpretation
of
question
is
whether
that
repeal
was
rendered
in
effective
as
to
prisoners
convicted
under
prior
law
because
of
two
savings
statutes.
section
1103
of
the
1970
act
and
section
109
of
title
1.
the
correct
answer
i
believe
is
that
those
statutes
do
not
preclude
parole
eligibility.
in
fact
if
this
court
whether
conclude
otherwise
since
no
rational
purpose
would
be
served
by
ninth
parole
to
the
800
persons
and
mr.
marrero’s
position
then
if
this
court
held
parole
was
unavailable
it
would
be
required
the
confront
constitutional
questions.
since
there
is
no
rational
purpose
to
be
served
would
not
a
denial
of
parole
contravene
equal
protection
guarantees
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
is
the
california
supreme
court
held
last
month
in
the
case
of
ray
foust
is
not
denying
parole
to
drug
offenders,
a
violation
of
the
eight
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
that
constitutes
rule
and
unusual
punishment.
but
i
think
an
analysis
of
the
savings
statutes
shows
that
these
constitutional
questions
need
never
be
reached
because
those
statutes
when
correctly
construed
do
not
preclude
parole.
first
of
course,
the
operation
of
the
two
saving
statutes
must
be
evaluated
in
the
light
of
congresses
over
all
plans
in
1970
for
solving
the
drug
problem
and
accordance
with
--
and
in
accordance
with
the
well
established
rule
of
statutory
construction,
that
statutes
must
always
be
construed
to
effectuate
remedial
objectives.
the
first
statute
then
is
section
1103
of
the
1970
act
and
that
was
a
statute
designed
to
save
prosecutions
for
violations
of
prior
law
and
nothing
more.
now
this
court
has
already
construed
section
1103
last
term
in
the
case
of
bradley
against
the
united
states.
and
there
this
court
said
that
the
word
prosecution
as
used
in
1103
is
to
be
defined
by
its
ordinary
legal
usage
and
i
think
is
as
clear
from
this
court’s
decision
in
morrisey
against
brewer
the
parole
process
is
not
part
of
a
prosecution
in
the
ordinary
legal
sentence.
but
in
bradley
this
court
was
confronted
with
the
question
of
where
congress
intended
to
draw
the
line
in
not
changing
the
operation
of
prior
law?
and
it
concluded
that
the
word
prosecution
is
used
in
section
1103
precluded
the
trial
court
in
granting
probation
of
accelerating
a
parole
eligibility
date.
but
this
court
specifically
point
it
out
that
parole
under
4202
was
a
very
different
thing
and
respondent
submits
that
those
differences
are
with
applied
that
mr.
marrero
be
considered
eligible
for
parole.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
well
you
honor,
i
believe
the
similar
questions
are
raised
except
there
was
a
rational
purpose
to
be
served
by
the
construction
adopted
by
this
court
in
bradley
because
i
believe
it
was
rational
to
conclude
that
congress
did
not
intended
--
did
not
intend
that
1970
act
either
reopen
prior
criminal
proceedings
or
that
it
would
treat
unequally
persons
convicted
of
violations
of
prior
law.
and
if
either
of
those
or
if
this
court
had
allowed
a
trial
court
to
place
a
prisoner
on
probation
or
had
allowed
the
trial
court
to
decide
whether
to
accelerate
his
parole
eligibility
date
then
either
prisoners
convicted
of
violating
prior
law
would
have
had
their
eligibility
for
probation
or
the
question
of
whether
their
parole
eligibility
date
could
be
accelerated
in
turn
of
the
two
of
the
circumstance
whether
or
not
they
were
sentenced
before
or
after
may
1,
1971.
but
the
alternative
would
have
been
for
all
prior
criminal
proceedings
to
have
reopened.
not
only
placing
and
undo
burden
on
the
courts
but
also
in
the
face
of
the
probation
statute.
and
the
statute
allowing
acceleration
of
parole
which
states
of
those
determinations
must
be
made
at
sentence
--
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
i
think
those
reasons
gave
a
rational
justification
for
this
court’s
interpretation
in
bradley
but
none
of
those
reasons
is
present
here
today
and
a
case
involving
section
4202.
parole
under
4202
simply
creates
no
administrator
problems
whatsoever.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
no
your
honor,
i
think
not.
the
question
in
bradley
was
section
4208
and
that
concerns
a
trial
court’s
acceleration
of
the
parole
eligibility
date.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
that’s
correct
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
well,
he
could
not
exercise
his
discretion
that
was
granted
to
him
under
section
4202
to
accelerate
the
eligibility
date.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
yes
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
well,
i
think
that
mischaracterizes
the
parole
process
your
honor.
under
4208
the
trial
judge
can
accelerate
the
parole
eligibility
date
but
parole
itself
is
granted
by
section
4202
and
the
trial
judge
can
appeal
with
that.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
your
honor,
i
believed
what
this
court
said
was
those
decisions
of
the
trial
court
which
were
made
at
the
time
of
sentencing
and
therefore,
were
essentially
part
of
the
sentencing
process
were
caught
by
the
word
prosecution
is
used
in
1103.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
your
honor
again,
i
think
not
because
what
this
court
said
was
the
trial
court
could
not
accelerate.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
yes.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
well
your
honor,
i
think
perhaps
the
problem
is
the
government’s
argument
and
that
the
argument
your
honor
is
directing
himself
to.
is
that
the
word
prosecution
may
preclude
parole
because
the
date
of
parole
eligibility
depends
on
the
length
of
sentence
and
sentence
is
set
by
a
trial
court
and
i
guess
that
would
be
the
essence
of
the
government’s
argument
is
to
why
prosecution
catches
parole
ineligibility.but
i
think
the
relationship
of
parole
under
4202
to
sentence
is
only
incidental.
it
exists
only
because
congress
elected
to
use
the
length
of
sentence
as
one
of
the
criteria
for
determining
whether
a
prisoner
should
be
released
on
parole.
i
believe
that
eligibility
for
parole
itself
is
a
feature
of
statute
created
by
the
congress.
parole
is
determined
by
the
administrative
body
and
whether
one
is
eligible
for
parole
is
a
question
only
of
a
person’s
status
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
it
does
not
involve
an
exercise
of
judicial
discretion
by
a
trial
court
in
making
any
specific
determination.
i
believe
them
the
fact
is
that
the
word
prosecution
does
not
preclude
parole
eligibility
and
that
section
7237
(d)
is
not
saved
by
1103
and
that
conclusion
effectuates
the
rehabilitative
purpose
intended
by
congress
in
enacting
the
1971.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
your
honor
--
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
it
is
not
in
the
record.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
yes,
your
honor
because
congress
--
the
government’s
argument
in
--
with
respect
to
congressional
intent
rest
largely
on
section
848.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
your
honor,
i’m
sorry.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
your
honor,
the
penal
authorities
have
many
programs
including
those
of
parole
but
prisoners
are
placed
in
supervised
environments
are
given
jobs,
or
given
training.
the
parole
board
is
the
board
which
evaluates
whether
these
programs
will
be
effective
in
adopting
a
prisoner
to
fit
back
into
society.
now,
i’m
not
going
to
infringe
my
view
on
their
judgment
because
i
have
never
been
involved
in
a
parole
process
but
i
think
it’s
recognized
as
a
principle
of
penology
that
most
prisoners
can
be
rehabilitated
if
they
are
placed
in
a
proper
environment
to
do
so
and
the
parole
board
is
one
of
the
important
mechanisms
or
accomplish
in
that.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
your
honor
i
think
it
is.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
your
honor
it’s
very
hard
to
say
what
the
board
pusher
means.
the
only
case
--
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
well,
then
i
think
the
statute
clearly
intends
that
many
of
them
be
rehabilitated
your
honor
because
the
statute
--
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
it
is
aimed
that
addicts
and
users,
and
i
think
also
pushers
unless
they
are
in
a
supervisory
position
fopur
to
five
persons.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
your
honor
the
only
thing
in
the
statute.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
its
--
by
virtue
of
section
848
which
bars
parole
in
one
very
limited
instance.
namely
a
person
who
supervises
is
five
or
more
others
in
the
sale
of
drugs
and
derives
substantial
income
from
them.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor
that’s
correct.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
it
was
to
rehabilitate
the
individual
who
sells
drugs
either
because
he
is
a
user
or
because
he
is
an
addict
or
because
he’s
in
powers
and
he
is
selling
to
a
small
group
of
people
and
he
is
the
kind
of
person
that
hopefully
society
can
salvage
and
make
a
useful
person
again.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
your
honor,
i
do
not
know.
there
are
no
facts,
and
a
record
on
this
case
and
i
am
not
familiar
with
mr.
marrero
personally
to
be
able
to
find
out.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
he
was
apprehended
according
to
the
second
circuit
opinion
on
a
roof
of
a
building
in
west
harlem,
new
york
in
which
they
found
drugs
and
he
was
the
owner
of
the
apartment.
beyond
that
i
do
not
know
specifically
what
he
is
ever
done.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
yet,
he
was
convicted
in
one
other
instance
of
possessing
drugs.
yes
your
honor.
it
does
not
say
whether
he
is
a
user
or
an
addict
or
a
pusher.
i
really
do
not
know.
mr.
john
j.
witmeyer,
iii
that
it’s
probably
was
selling.
yes,
your
honor.
your
honor,
i
think
that
one
remaining
question
facing
this
then
today
is
section
109
of
title
one
which
is
the
general
federal
savings
statute.
but
i
think
before
considering
the
operation
of
section
109
is
necessary
determined
whether
it
should
be
applied
at
all
in
this
case.
and
i
believe
the
answer
is
109
should
not
be
applied
for
two
reasons.
first,
section
109
originally
enacted
in
1871
was
intended
only
to
aviate
the
need
for
including
a
specific
savings
clause
and
every
repealing
statute
in
order
to
preclude
what
are
called
common
law
technical
abatements.
i
think
it’s
evident
from
the
history
of
the
1871
act
that
that
act
was
not
intended
to
substantially
change
the
law
or
to
a
rack
substantial
impediments
to
effectuating
remedial
statutes.
and
in
this
case
the
1970
drug
control
act
has
its
own
savings
clause
section
1103.
and
1103
specifically
limited
to
prosecutions
and
nothing
more
and
1103
in
compresses
all
violations
of
prior
law.
if
109
covers
more
than
1103
then
these
two
statutes
are
clearly
in
conflict
and
1103
as
the
latest
expression
on
the
legislative
will,
should
prevail.
second,
allowing
parole
eligibility
is
not
the
consequence
of
a
technical
abatement
as
the
term
was
used
to
common
law
and
since
i
believe
the
purpose
of
109
is
to
prevent
technical
abatements
applying
109
to
preclude
parole
eligibility
would
not
effectuate
its
purpose.
and
for
these
reasons
109
should
not
be
applied
at
all.
but
even
if
this
court
does
decide
to
reach
the
question
of
the
actual
operation
of
109,
the
conclusion
still
is
that
it
does
not
preclude
parole
eligibility.
the
effect
to
section
109
in
this
case
depends
upon
the
meaning
of
two
words
used
in
that
statute.
one
is
prosecution
the
other
is
penalty.
since
prosecution
is
used
in
section
1103
does
not
preclude
parole
then
is
used
in
109
it
should
not
do
so
either.
the
question
then
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
“penalty”
as
used
in
109
and
i
believe
there
are
three
reasons
why
the
term
penalty
does
not
bar
parole.
first,
section
109
is
written
in
two
parallel
clauses.
one
refers
to
sustaining
prosecutions
and
the
other
to
releasing
their
extinguishing
penalties.
these
two
clauses
were
clearly
written
in
parallel
and
therefore
should
be
construed
consistent
with
each
other,
each
thus
saving
the
same
kinds
of
things,
if
prosecution
does
not
bar
parole
then
neither
does
penalty.
second,
in
a
criminal
case
as
five
circuits
have
all
ready
decided
i
believe
the
word
“penalty”
as
used
in
109
should
be
interpreted
to
mean
the
imposed
sentence
of
the
trial
court.
but
parole
under
4202
is
not
a
part
of
sentence.
and
release
on
parole
would
not
even
affect
and
impose
sentence
and
consequently
for
that
reason
also
the
term
penalty
should
not
bar
parole.
and
third,
if
the
word
penalty
bars
parole
then
not
same
word
picks
up
numerous
other
collateral
restraints
imposed
upon
convicts
under
federal
law.
and
no
practical
purpose
would
be
served
by
requiring
congress
to
include
language
accepting
amendments
to
any
of
those
statutes
from
the
effect
of
109.
the
answer
to
the
third
enquiry
then
i
think
is
that
the
language
of
the
applicable
statutes
permits
parole
eligibility
and
the
conclusion
is
then
that
the
technical
and
i
believe
purposeless
construction
urged
by
the
government
ought
to
be
rejected
because
congress
is
now
designed
a
comprehensive
plan
for
attacking
the
drug
problem
in
this
country
and
rehabilitative
programs
are
the
cornerstones
of
the
congressional
plan.
considering
mr.
marrero
and
the
800
other
prisoners
in
his
position
eligible
for
participation
and
the
important
rehabilitative
programs
that
parole
provides,
helps
effectuate
congresses
plan
for
solving
the
drug
problem
in
this
country
and
there
is
simply
no
justification
for
abandoning
these
800
prisoners.
for
condemning
them
to
serve
their
terms
without
access
to
import
rehabilitative
programs
and
for
frustrating
the
basic
purpose
of
the
1970
act.
for
this
court
to
exclude
mr.
marrero
from
parole
consideration
would
be
for
it
to
adopt
a
vindictive
approach
to
the
drug
problem
and
approach
which
congress
has
rejected
and
which
cannot
be
justified.
