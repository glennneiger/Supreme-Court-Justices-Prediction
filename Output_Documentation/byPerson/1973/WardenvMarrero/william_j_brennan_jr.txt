in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
held
that
the
comprehensive
drug
abuse
prevention
and
control
act
of
1970,
which
became
effective
on
may
1,
1971
had
repealed
provisions
of
trial
law
under
which
drug
offenders
sentenced
before
may
1,
1971
were
ineligible
for
consideration
for
parole.
we
disagree
and
hold
that
the
provisions
of
the
old
law
are
preserved
by
section
1103
(a)
of
a
new
law
and
by
the
general
saving
statute
1
u.s.c,
section
109.
we
therefore
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
