doesn’t
that
often
happen
in

drawing?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
when
you
speak
of
fraudulent
claims,
are
you
referring
to
those
that
would
involve
the
question
of
paternity?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
would
be
the
major,
you
say?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
in
your
view,
is
it
irrational
to
have

more
likely
to
be
receiving
support
than
illegitimate
children?

dependency
status,

children
were,

would
apparently
have
no
trouble
with
that?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
your
view
of
what
the
secretary
would
do
in
case
of
an
adoption
that
is
you
suggest
he
would
regard
that
as
a
manipulation,
his
view
is
certainly
not
an
immutable
view
of
the
matter,
is
it?
