well,
wouldn't
the

wouldn't
the
father
have
increased
benefits
if
this
child
were
legitimated?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
perhaps
i
don’t
understand
the
schemes.
i
had
the
impression
that
were
this
child
eligible,
that
would
mean
the
father’s
payments
would
be
larger.
is
that
right?
justice

the
child,
is
that
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

well
now,
if
this

were
legitimated,
would
it

receive
benefits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,

it
would?
justice
william

suppose
he
had
adopted
the

justice
william
j.
brennan,

well,
if
he
succeeded,
would
the

then
be
eligible?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that’s
then
to
say
that
nothing
can
be
done
to
make
this
child
eligible
for
benefits
if
illegitimate
at
the
time
of
the
or
born
after
the
