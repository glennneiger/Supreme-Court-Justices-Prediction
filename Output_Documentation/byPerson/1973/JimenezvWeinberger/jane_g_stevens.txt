ms.
jane
g.
stevens
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
discrimination
challenged
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
is
a
discrimination
between
legitimate
children
born
after
their
fathers
become
eligible
for
social
security
benefits
and
illegitimate
children
born
after
their
fathers
become
eligible
for
social
security
benefits.
if
eugenio
and
alicia
jimenez,
the
plaintiffs
herein,
were
legitimate
children,
they
would
now
be
receiving
social
security
benefits.
but
because
they
are
illegitimate,
they
are
absolutely
barred
from
receiving
benefits,
even
though
they
have
lived
with
their
father
all
their
lives
and
have
been
supported
by
him
all
their
lives
and
that
he
has
been
their
sole
caretaker
since
their
mother
left
the
home.
this
discrimination
between
legitimate
and
illegitimate
children
is
arbitrary
and
irrational.
it
is
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
guarantees
as
embodied
in
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
defends
the
discrimination
on
two
grounds.
that
it
is
reasonable
because
illegitimate
children
are
less
likely
to
have
received
support
from
their
fathers
than
legitimate
children,
and
that
it
serves
the
valid
governmental
purpose
of
preventing
fraud.
in
fact,
it
is
not
rationally
related
to
the
purpose
of
the
social
security
act
and
it
is
not
a
rational
means
of
preventing
fraud.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
i
would
be
here,
but
on
slightly
different
posture.
i
think
that
that
exclusion
also
would
be
irrational
in
light
of
the
purpose
of
the
act.
in
fact,
before
1960,
all
children
had
to
have
been
born
and
have
met
these
requirements
before
the
father
became
disabled
or
aged.
but,
congress
made
a
change
in
1960
to
allow
children
--
legitimate
children
to
prove
their
dependency
and
their
other
eligibility
requirements
at
the
time
application
was
filed
on
their
behalf.
and
now,
as
a
result
of
that
change,
only
illegitimate
children
are
excluded.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
exclusion
here,
if
i
may
put
it
that
way,
is
“overinclusive.”
the
government
says
that
they
have
excluded,
afterborn,
illegitimate
children
in
order
to
prevent
fraudulent
claims
and
they
have
excluded
with
the
possibly
fraudulent
claims
a
large
group
of,
in
fact,
valid
claimants.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
i
believe
it
does
happen,
but
i
think
that
when
there
are
less
drastic
means
for
sorting
out
the
fraudulent
from
the
valid
claims,
that
those
less
drastic
means
have
to
be
employed.
the
hearing
that
would
be
required
would
be
relatively
simple.
the
social
security
administration
is
clearly
able
to
distinguish
between
fraudulent
and
non-fraudulent
claims
and
the
reason
it’s
clear,
your
honor,
is
that
there
are
24
states
that
allow
illegitimate
children
to
inherit
from
their
fathers
by
the
laws
of
intestate
succession.
and
in
those
states,
children
are
defined
the
way
these
children
are
defined,
that
is
children
born
and
otherwise
eligible
after
their
fathers
become
eligible
for
benefits
are
allowed
to
present
their
claims
and
the
secretary
seems,
in
those
states,
perfectly
capable
of
sorting
the
fraudulent
from
the
non-fraudulent
claims.
therefore,
it
is
our
position
that
this
blanket
exclusion
cannot
be
necessary
to
sort
out
the
fraudulent
claims.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
that
would
be,
i
believe
your
honor,
the
major
problem
of
proof
because
--
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
there
is
also
the
issue
or
the
possibility
of
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
child
had
been
supported,
but
that
is
something
that
children
who
were
previously
born
have
to
prove
too.
so
the
only
possible
fraud
that
the
government
could
be
depending
on
would
be
children
who
are
not,
in
fact,
the
children
of
the
fathers.
and
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
although
it
is
difficult
to
prove
paternity,
the
paternity
proof
cannot
be
an
excuse
for
a
blanket
exclusion
of
an
entire
class.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
they
are
not
ineligible.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
if
they
lived
--
if
they
merely
live
in
a
state
in
which
they
would
be
allowed
to
inherit
by
the
laws
of
intestate
succession,
they
are
eligible
to
receive
these
benefits.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
i
imagine
that
in
the
probate
proceedings
that
might
be
an
issue.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
but
they
are
eligible
regardless
of
what
has
happened
prior
to
the
death
of
the
father.
i
think
--
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
and
i
think
this
points
up
a
very
important
factor
of
this
law.
the
law
depends
on
the
law
of
intestate
succession
for
giving
benefits
to
children
whose
parents
are
still
alive
and
so,
the
process
by
which
the
state
will
make
that
decision
has
not
yet
been
affected.
in
fact,
the
law
--
this
federal
law,
this
federal
program
is
depending
on
the
state
law
of
intestate
succession
for
the
disposition
of
benefits
while
the
father
is
still
alive.
so
that
that
process
has
not
yet
come
into
play.
and
i
think
that
if
the
federal
statute
were
to
depend
on
a
state
law
for
definition
of
familial
obligation,
it
would
be
reasonable
for
the
federal
statute
to
depend
on
laws
that
controlled
support
by
the
father
while
the
father
was
still
living,
and
this
court
said
only
last
year
that
once
a
legitimate
child
has
been
given
a
right
to
support
by
the
father,
an
illegitimate
child
must
be
given
that
right
also.
and
i
think
that
that
decision
in
gomez
v.
perez
should
be
controlling
in
this
situation.
it’s
not
only
--
in
fact,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
will
be
eligible
to
receive
benefits
under
this
section
after
their
father
dies
because
his
acknowledgment
of
the
children
while
it
came
after
the
onset
of
disability
and,
therefore,
does
not
qualify
the
children
now
will
have
come
before
his
death.
and
so,
it
will
qualify
them
after
he
dies
in
an
irrational
and
arbitrary
manner.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
he
is
living.
he
is
disabled.
yes,
sir,
the
disability
benefits.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
no,
this
is
the
social
security
oasdi
program
and
they
would
--
the
benefits
would
go
to
the
children,
to
these
illegitimate
children.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
directly,
probably
in
his
name
because
he
is
their
guardian.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
the
issue
that
the
government
depends
on
largely
that
illegitimate
children
are
less
likely
to
have
been
receiving
support
than
legitimate
children
and
that,
therefore,
this
is
a
rational
distinction
is,
in
fact,
irrelevant
in
this
case
because
the
section
at
issue
makes
dependency
or
the
right
to
support
a
requirement
of
eligibility
for
all
children.
the
general
likelihood
of
illegitimate
children
to
support
is
completely
irrelevant
because
no
one,
legitimate
or
illegitimate,
can
receive
benefits
who
doesn’t
have
the
experience
of
or
the
right
to
support.
and
the
right
to
support
is
adequate
because
legitimate
children
never
have
to
prove
dependency.
illegitimate
children
under
section
216
(h)
(3)
have
to
have
been
acknowledged
or
declared
by
a
court
to
be
eligible
to
be
their
father’s
children
or
beneficiaries
of
a
court
support
order
and
any
of
these
children
have
a
right
to
support.
those
who
have
not
been
acknowledged
have
to
have
had
experience
of
support.
so,
the
general
likelihood
of
illegitimate
children
to
receive
support
cannot
be
relevant
even
if
this
court
would
remove
this
bar
excluding,
afterborn
illegitimate
children,
no
child
would
become
eligible
who
did
not
have
the
right
to
or
the
experience
of
support.
therefore,
that
argument
on
the
part
of
the
government
is
completely
irrelevant.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
i’m
not
contesting
that
presumption,
but
the
presumption
that
includes
them
and
excludes
illegitimate
children
on
the
same
basis
are
presumptions
that
operate
generally
for
the
entire
class
and
doesn’t
allow
any
of
them
to
offer
proof
of
their
particular
situation,
i
believe,
has
an
irrational
effect.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that,
in
fact,
illegitimacy
is
a
suspect
classification
and
would
request
that
this
court
recognize
illegitimacy
as
a
suspect
classification.
and
if
it
were
so
recognized,
then
a
requirement
that
illegitimate
children
prove
dependency
when
legitimate
children
did
not
have
to,
i
think
would
be
a
discrimination,
because
in
that
case,
the
state
would
have
to
prove
a
stricter
stand
--
would
have
to
defend
the
requirement
against
a
stricter
constitutional
standard.
the
argument
that
the
government
is
left
with
because
of
the
irrelevancy
of
the
support
is
the
prevention
of
fraud
argument.
and
i
think
that
in
recent
cases,
this
court
has
indicated
that
an
exclusion
of
an
entire
group
of
potential
recipients
solely
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
fraud
and
promoting
administrative
efficiency
is
not
permissible.
this
is
to
create
an
irrebuttable
presumption
essentially
identical
to
that
created
--
to
that
invalidated
by
this
court
in
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
versus
murry
just
last
year.
in
murry,
a
section
of
the
food
stamp
act
declared
ineligible
any
household
containing
a
person
over
18
years
of
age
who’d
been
claimed
as
a
dependent
for
federal
tax
purposes
by
someone
not
eligible
for
food
stamps.
and
this
court
found
that
that
section
was
not
a
rational
measure
and
that
it
rested
on
an
irrebuttable
presumption
often
contrary
to
fact
and,
therefore,
violated
due
process
requirements.
and
i
think
that
the
irrebuttable
presumption
which
is
created
in
this
case,
which
excludes
the
plaintiffs
and
others
like
them,
is
similarly
often
contrary
to
fact
and
a
violation
of
due
process
because
these
children
are
not
allowed
to
offer
the
proof
that
they
meet
the
requirements
of
section
216
(h)
(3).
if
they
were
legitimate
or
if
they
have
been
born
before
their
fathers
became
eligible
for
benefits,
they
would
be
allowed
to
offer
their
proof
and,
should
it
be
satisfactory
to
the
secretary,
they
would
be
found
eligible
for
benefits.
now,
they
are
totally
and
absolutely
barred
from
offering
that
proof.
the
discrimination
against
illegitimate
children,
here
challenged,
violates
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
equal
protection
judged
by
the
traditional
standards
because
it’s
not
rationally
related
to
the
purpose
of
the
act.
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
not
simply
to
replace
support,
lost
at
the
moment
the
wage
earner
creases
being
able
to
work.
if
that
were
true,
legitimate
afterborn
children
would
still
be
barred,
and
they
are
not.
i
think
that
the
standard
must
fall
for
still
another
reason
and
that
is
that
it
is
a
discrimination
based
on
the
status
of
illegitimacy
and
illegitimacy
is
properly
a
suspect
to
class.
several
weeks
ago,
this
court
in
johnson
versus
robison
indicated
the
traditional
indicia
of
suspectness
and
said
that
the
co
class,
at
issue
in
that
case,
did
not
possess
an
immutable
characteristic
determined
solely
by
accident
of
birth.
but
illegitimate
children
possess
exactly
that,
an
immutable
characteristic
determined
solely
by
the
accident
of
birth.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
not
at
their
own
desire
or
control.
they
can
be
legitimated,
but
their
parents
who
put
them
in
the
illegitimate
status
to
begin
with
must
make
the
decision
to
do
that.
the
child
--
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
it’s
not
as
immutable,
but
to
the
degree
--
in
terms
of
the
control
of
the
person
so-classified,
it
is
immutable.
there
is
no
way
an
illegitimate
child
can
have
the
status
changed
and
if
--
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
i
would
think
that
that
kind
of
conscious
--
that
the
choice
of
one’s
conscience
is
something
that
one
has
more
control
over,
although
you
wouldn’t
change
it
at
a
whim
to
obtain
a
benefit.
it
is
something
that
you
may
rethink
and
something
that
you
may
change.
a
status
at
law
over
which
you
have
no
control
is
something
that
you
cannot
change.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
if
this
child
received
benefits,
the
family
all
together
would
have
--
the
family
in
which
--
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
the
child
would
receive
benefits.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
that’s
right.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
yes.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
yes,
but
there
is
no
way
that
the
child
can
be
legitimated
now
because
the
mother
of
the
child
left
the
father
years
ago.
the
only
way
that
he
could
legitimate
the
child
would
be
to
marry
the
child’s
mother.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
it’s
not
certain
that
he
could
adopt
the
child,
your
honor,
but
he
certainly
--
he
could
attempt
to
adopt
the
child.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
i
think
that
the
child
would
be
eligible
if
he
did
that.
however,
there
is
--
it
isn’t
clear
that
he
could
adopt
him
and
the
secretary
has
suggested
that
the
purpose
of
this
entire
section
is
to
discourage
the
manipulation
of
events
solely
in
order
to
obtain
benefits.
and
if
he
were
to
adopt
this
child
for
no
other
reason
than
to
obtain
benefits,
surely,
this
would
be
the
kind
of
manipulation
of
events
that
the
secretary
says
the
section
is
meant
to
prevent.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
if
he
were
not
to
adopt
him?
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
then
there
would
be
no
other
way
except
to
remove
this
bar.
that’s
true,
your
honor.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
he’s
--
the
secretary’s?
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
i
hope
not,
your
honor.
however,
in
stanley
versus
illinois,
i
believe
that
this
court
stated
that
to
force
a
father
to
adopt
his
natural
child
in
order
to
go
around
a
burden
that
was
placed
on
him
only
as
the
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
would
be
an
unjust
and
arbitrary
burden
to
place
on
him
when
a
father
of
a
legitimate
child
in
a
similar
situation
would
not
have
this
burden.
it’s
also
true,
your
honor,
that
this
--
that
the
father
of
the
children
in
this
case
is
an
elderly,
disabled,
impecunious
gentleman,
and
it’s
not
certain
that
the
courts
of
illinois
would
allow
him
to
adopt
the
child
for
those
reasons.
the
other
indicia
of
suspectness
that
the
court
pointed
to
was
that
the
--
was
the
saddling
of
a
class
with
disabilities
in
the
history
of
purposeful
unequal
treatment
and
a
position
of
political
powerlessness
so
as
to
command
extraordinary
protection
from
the
majoritarian
political
process.
and
it
is
surely
clear
that
illegitimate
children
are
in
a
situation
of
political
powerlessness,
although
they
are
frequently
legislated
against
as
a
group,
they
have
no
legislative
power
as
a
group.
they
are
a
discrete
and
insular
minority
who
have
no
political
power
to
defend
themselves
against
this
kind
of
arbitrary
--
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
i
think
that
they
have
more
political
power,
your
honor,
because
they
aren’t
discriminated
against
in
this
way.
there
are
situations
in
which
legitimate
children
are
discriminated
against
as
children
as
opposed
to
adults,
but
there
are
more
valid
and
reasonable
distinctions
between
children
and
adults
than
between
children
who
differ
only
because
of
the
marital
status
of
their
parents.
the
children
in
this
situation
--
the
illegitimate
children
are
classified
solely
by
an
accident
of
their
birth,
and
they
cannot
change
it.
they
have
no
control
over
it.
they
have
suffered
as
a
result
of
this
classification,
a
stigma
from
which
they
will
never
recover.
and
stigma
is,
i
believe,
a
characteristic
which
this
court
has
sought
to
counteract
by
granting
stricter
judicial
scrutiny
to
those
classes
of
people
who
have
suffered
from
that
kind
of
stigma,
particularly
in
the
situation
where
the
law
in
question
will
perpetuate
the
stigma
and
perpetuate
the
historical
suffering
of
the
class,
as
this
will
do.
legitimate
siblings
of
these
children
will
be
able
to
receive
benefits.
in
fact,
they
have
legitimate
siblings
who
are
receiving
benefits
and
to
distinguish
between
the
legitimate
and
illegitimate
siblings
is
only
to
perpetrate
the
stigma
that
these
children
must
suffer
because
of
their
parent’s
marital
status.
the
statutory
section
challenged
here
should,
therefore,
be
subject
to
strict
scrutiny
and
be
upheld
only
if
it
is
crucial
to
a
compelling
state
interest
which
it
clearly
is
not.
the
government
has
been
able
to
show
indeed
no
rational
purpose
for
this
classification,
much
less
a
compelling
state
purpose.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
identically
situated
to
children
who
would
be
able
to
receive
benefits,
except
for
the
fact
that
their
father
and
mother
never
married.
and
this
fault,
if
you
will,
of
their
parents
should
not
be
used
to
deprive
them
of
rights
which
they
would
otherwise
have.
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
--
that
counsel
for
the
secretary
has
depended
on
two,
if
i
may
say
so,
flawed
arguments.
the
first
is
that
the
likelihood
--
that
the
purpose
of
this
section
is
to
provide
support
for
those
most
likely
to
have
lost
support.
and
i
think
that
the
clear
fact
that
legitimate
children
born
after
the
onset
of
disability
who
never
had
support
from
current
earnings
are
eligible
must
indicate
that
that
cannot
be
the
purpose
of
this
distinction.
legitimate
children
who
have
had
no
prior
experience
of
support
are
eligible
to
receive
these
benefits.
and
the
other
buttress
of
the
secretary’s
argument
is
that
the
distinction
is
based
on
a
distinction
between
those
who
can
and
those
who
cannot
inherit
under
the
laws
of
intestacy,
and
there
are
two
weaknesses
in
that
argument.
the
first
is
in
the
legislative
history,
in
1965,
when
they
added
this
section
to
the
act,
congress
stated
and
i
would
read
a
quote
to
you
from
senate
report
404
in
1965.
“the
committee
believes
that
in
a
national
program,
that
is
intended
to
pay
benefits
to
replace
support
for
a
child
when
his
father
retires,
dies,
or
becomes
disabled,
whether
a
child
gets
benefits
should
not
depend
on
whether
he
can
inherit
his
father’s
intestate
personal
property
under
the
laws
of
the
state
in
which
his
father
happens
to
live.”
that
was
not,
in
fact,
the
intent
of
congress.
the
purpose
of
adding
section
216
in
the
first
place
was
so
that
this
federal
program
would
not
depend
exclusively
on
the
state
laws
of
intestate
succession.
and
the
other
weakness
of
that
argument
is
that
this
is
not
a
means
for
deciding
who
will
receive
benefits
after
a
wage
earner
dies,
but
who
will
receive
benefits
while
he
is
still
alive
and
would
be,
but
for
his
disability
or
age,
supporting
the
children.
and
therefore,
it
would
be
rational
perhaps
to
depend
on
laws
providing
support,
but
not
on
the
laws
of
intestate
succession.
in
fact,
mr.
jimenez
in
this
case
has
acknowledged
these
children
formally
in
writing
and
they
will
be
eligible
to
receive
benefits
when
he
dies.
and
in
fact,
even
if
he
had
not
acknowledged
them
in
writing,
they
would
be
eligible
to
receive
benefits
when
he
dies
because
he
is
living
with
them
and
living
with
them
is
a
means
to
qualify
under
this
section.
the
likelihood
of
support
is
simply
not
relevant
in
a
section
which
makes
necessary
for
eligibility
acknowledgment
or
a
court
order
which
would
give
a
right
to
support
or
the
experience
of
support
or
“living
with.”
no
one
will
qualify
under
this
section
who
has
not
the
right
to
or
the
experience
of
support,
no
matter
when
he
was
born
in
relation
to
his
father’s
age
or
disability.
and
therefore,
i
think
that
the
argument
on
which
the
secretary
now
apparently
entirely
depends,
is
an
argument
without
merit
and,
therefore,
i
respectfully
request
that
this
exclusion
of
afterborn
children
be
stricken
from
the
section.
thank
you.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
discrimination
challenged
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
is
a
discrimination
between
legitimate
children
born
after
their
fathers
become
eligible
for
social
security
benefits
and
illegitimate
children
born
after
their
fathers
become
eligible
for
social
security
benefits.
if
eugenio
and
alicia
jimenez,
the
plaintiffs
herein,
were
legitimate
children,
they
would
now
be
receiving
social
security
benefits.
but
because
they
are
illegitimate,
they
are
absolutely
barred
from
receiving
benefits,
even
though
they
have
lived
with
their
father
all
their
lives
and
have
been
supported
by
him
all
their
lives
and
that
he
has
been
their
sole
caretaker
since
their
mother
left
the
home.
this
discrimination
between
legitimate
and
illegitimate
children
is
arbitrary
and
irrational.
it
is
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
guarantees
as
embodied
in
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare
defends
the
discrimination
on
two
grounds.
that
it
is
reasonable
because
illegitimate
children
are
less
likely
to
have
received
support
from
their
fathers
than
legitimate
children,
and
that
it
serves
the
valid
governmental
purpose
of
preventing
fraud.
in
fact,
it
is
not
rationally
related
to
the
purpose
of
the
social
security
act
and
it
is
not
a
rational
means
of
preventing
fraud.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
i
would
be
here,
but
on
slightly
different
posture.
i
think
that
that
exclusion
also
would
be
irrational
in
light
of
the
purpose
of
the
act.
in
fact,
before
1960,
all
children
had
to
have
been
born
and
have
met
these
requirements
before
the
father
became
disabled
or
aged.
but,
congress
made
a
change
in
1960
to
allow
children
--
legitimate
children
to
prove
their
dependency
and
their
other
eligibility
requirements
at
the
time
application
was
filed
on
their
behalf.
and
now,
as
a
result
of
that
change,
only
illegitimate
children
are
excluded.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
exclusion
here,
if
i
may
put
it
that
way,
is
“overinclusive.”
the
government
says
that
they
have
excluded,
afterborn,
illegitimate
children
in
order
to
prevent
fraudulent
claims
and
they
have
excluded
with
the
possibly
fraudulent
claims
a
large
group
of,
in
fact,
valid
claimants.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
i
believe
it
does
happen,
but
i
think
that
when
there
are
less
drastic
means
for
sorting
out
the
fraudulent
from
the
valid
claims,
that
those
less
drastic
means
have
to
be
employed.
the
hearing
that
would
be
required
would
be
relatively
simple.
the
social
security
administration
is
clearly
able
to
distinguish
between
fraudulent
and
non-fraudulent
claims
and
the
reason
it’s
clear,
your
honor,
is
that
there
are
24
states
that
allow
illegitimate
children
to
inherit
from
their
fathers
by
the
laws
of
intestate
succession.
and
in
those
states,
children
are
defined
the
way
these
children
are
defined,
that
is
children
born
and
otherwise
eligible
after
their
fathers
become
eligible
for
benefits
are
allowed
to
present
their
claims
and
the
secretary
seems,
in
those
states,
perfectly
capable
of
sorting
the
fraudulent
from
the
non-fraudulent
claims.
therefore,
it
is
our
position
that
this
blanket
exclusion
cannot
be
necessary
to
sort
out
the
fraudulent
claims.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
that
would
be,
i
believe
your
honor,
the
major
problem
of
proof
because
--
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
there
is
also
the
issue
or
the
possibility
of
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
child
had
been
supported,
but
that
is
something
that
children
who
were
previously
born
have
to
prove
too.
so
the
only
possible
fraud
that
the
government
could
be
depending
on
would
be
children
who
are
not,
in
fact,
the
children
of
the
fathers.
and
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
although
it
is
difficult
to
prove
paternity,
the
paternity
proof
cannot
be
an
excuse
for
a
blanket
exclusion
of
an
entire
class.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
they
are
not
ineligible.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
if
they
lived
--
if
they
merely
live
in
a
state
in
which
they
would
be
allowed
to
inherit
by
the
laws
of
intestate
succession,
they
are
eligible
to
receive
these
benefits.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
i
imagine
that
in
the
probate
proceedings
that
might
be
an
issue.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
but
they
are
eligible
regardless
of
what
has
happened
prior
to
the
death
of
the
father.
i
think
--
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
and
i
think
this
points
up
a
very
important
factor
of
this
law.
the
law
depends
on
the
law
of
intestate
succession
for
giving
benefits
to
children
whose
parents
are
still
alive
and
so,
the
process
by
which
the
state
will
make
that
decision
has
not
yet
been
affected.
in
fact,
the
law
--
this
federal
law,
this
federal
program
is
depending
on
the
state
law
of
intestate
succession
for
the
disposition
of
benefits
while
the
father
is
still
alive.
so
that
that
process
has
not
yet
come
into
play.
and
i
think
that
if
the
federal
statute
were
to
depend
on
a
state
law
for
definition
of
familial
obligation,
it
would
be
reasonable
for
the
federal
statute
to
depend
on
laws
that
controlled
support
by
the
father
while
the
father
was
still
living,
and
this
court
said
only
last
year
that
once
a
legitimate
child
has
been
given
a
right
to
support
by
the
father,
an
illegitimate
child
must
be
given
that
right
also.
and
i
think
that
that
decision
in
gomez
v.
perez
should
be
controlling
in
this
situation.
it’s
not
only
--
in
fact,
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
will
be
eligible
to
receive
benefits
under
this
section
after
their
father
dies
because
his
acknowledgment
of
the
children
while
it
came
after
the
onset
of
disability
and,
therefore,
does
not
qualify
the
children
now
will
have
come
before
his
death.
and
so,
it
will
qualify
them
after
he
dies
in
an
irrational
and
arbitrary
manner.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
he
is
living.
he
is
disabled.
yes,
sir,
the
disability
benefits.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
no,
this
is
the
social
security
oasdi
program
and
they
would
--
the
benefits
would
go
to
the
children,
to
these
illegitimate
children.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
directly,
probably
in
his
name
because
he
is
their
guardian.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
the
issue
that
the
government
depends
on
largely
that
illegitimate
children
are
less
likely
to
have
been
receiving
support
than
legitimate
children
and
that,
therefore,
this
is
a
rational
distinction
is,
in
fact,
irrelevant
in
this
case
because
the
section
at
issue
makes
dependency
or
the
right
to
support
a
requirement
of
eligibility
for
all
children.
the
general
likelihood
of
illegitimate
children
to
support
is
completely
irrelevant
because
no
one,
legitimate
or
illegitimate,
can
receive
benefits
who
doesn’t
have
the
experience
of
or
the
right
to
support.
and
the
right
to
support
is
adequate
because
legitimate
children
never
have
to
prove
dependency.
illegitimate
children
under
section
216
(h)
(3)
have
to
have
been
acknowledged
or
declared
by
a
court
to
be
eligible
to
be
their
father’s
children
or
beneficiaries
of
a
court
support
order
and
any
of
these
children
have
a
right
to
support.
those
who
have
not
been
acknowledged
have
to
have
had
experience
of
support.
so,
the
general
likelihood
of
illegitimate
children
to
receive
support
cannot
be
relevant
even
if
this
court
would
remove
this
bar
excluding,
afterborn
illegitimate
children,
no
child
would
become
eligible
who
did
not
have
the
right
to
or
the
experience
of
support.
therefore,
that
argument
on
the
part
of
the
government
is
completely
irrelevant.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
i’m
not
contesting
that
presumption,
but
the
presumption
that
includes
them
and
excludes
illegitimate
children
on
the
same
basis
are
presumptions
that
operate
generally
for
the
entire
class
and
doesn’t
allow
any
of
them
to
offer
proof
of
their
particular
situation,
i
believe,
has
an
irrational
effect.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that,
in
fact,
illegitimacy
is
a
suspect
classification
and
would
request
that
this
court
recognize
illegitimacy
as
a
suspect
classification.
and
if
it
were
so
recognized,
then
a
requirement
that
illegitimate
children
prove
dependency
when
legitimate
children
did
not
have
to,
i
think
would
be
a
discrimination,
because
in
that
case,
the
state
would
have
to
prove
a
stricter
stand
--
would
have
to
defend
the
requirement
against
a
stricter
constitutional
standard.
the
argument
that
the
government
is
left
with
because
of
the
irrelevancy
of
the
support
is
the
prevention
of
fraud
argument.
and
i
think
that
in
recent
cases,
this
court
has
indicated
that
an
exclusion
of
an
entire
group
of
potential
recipients
solely
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
fraud
and
promoting
administrative
efficiency
is
not
permissible.
this
is
to
create
an
irrebuttable
presumption
essentially
identical
to
that
created
--
to
that
invalidated
by
this
court
in
the
united
states
department
of
agriculture
versus
murry
just
last
year.
in
murry,
a
section
of
the
food
stamp
act
declared
ineligible
any
household
containing
a
person
over
18
years
of
age
who’d
been
claimed
as
a
dependent
for
federal
tax
purposes
by
someone
not
eligible
for
food
stamps.
and
this
court
found
that
that
section
was
not
a
rational
measure
and
that
it
rested
on
an
irrebuttable
presumption
often
contrary
to
fact
and,
therefore,
violated
due
process
requirements.
and
i
think
that
the
irrebuttable
presumption
which
is
created
in
this
case,
which
excludes
the
plaintiffs
and
others
like
them,
is
similarly
often
contrary
to
fact
and
a
violation
of
due
process
because
these
children
are
not
allowed
to
offer
the
proof
that
they
meet
the
requirements
of
section
216
(h)
(3).
if
they
were
legitimate
or
if
they
have
been
born
before
their
fathers
became
eligible
for
benefits,
they
would
be
allowed
to
offer
their
proof
and,
should
it
be
satisfactory
to
the
secretary,
they
would
be
found
eligible
for
benefits.
now,
they
are
totally
and
absolutely
barred
from
offering
that
proof.
the
discrimination
against
illegitimate
children,
here
challenged,
violates
the
constitutional
guarantee
of
equal
protection
judged
by
the
traditional
standards
because
it’s
not
rationally
related
to
the
purpose
of
the
act.
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
not
simply
to
replace
support,
lost
at
the
moment
the
wage
earner
creases
being
able
to
work.
if
that
were
true,
legitimate
afterborn
children
would
still
be
barred,
and
they
are
not.
i
think
that
the
standard
must
fall
for
still
another
reason
and
that
is
that
it
is
a
discrimination
based
on
the
status
of
illegitimacy
and
illegitimacy
is
properly
a
suspect
to
class.
several
weeks
ago,
this
court
in
johnson
versus
robison
indicated
the
traditional
indicia
of
suspectness
and
said
that
the
co
class,
at
issue
in
that
case,
did
not
possess
an
immutable
characteristic
determined
solely
by
accident
of
birth.
but
illegitimate
children
possess
exactly
that,
an
immutable
characteristic
determined
solely
by
the
accident
of
birth.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
not
at
their
own
desire
or
control.
they
can
be
legitimated,
but
their
parents
who
put
them
in
the
illegitimate
status
to
begin
with
must
make
the
decision
to
do
that.
the
child
--
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
it’s
not
as
immutable,
but
to
the
degree
--
in
terms
of
the
control
of
the
person
so-classified,
it
is
immutable.
there
is
no
way
an
illegitimate
child
can
have
the
status
changed
and
if
--
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
i
would
think
that
that
kind
of
conscious
--
that
the
choice
of
one’s
conscience
is
something
that
one
has
more
control
over,
although
you
wouldn’t
change
it
at
a
whim
to
obtain
a
benefit.
it
is
something
that
you
may
rethink
and
something
that
you
may
change.
a
status
at
law
over
which
you
have
no
control
is
something
that
you
cannot
change.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
if
this
child
received
benefits,
the
family
all
together
would
have
--
the
family
in
which
--
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
the
child
would
receive
benefits.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
that’s
right.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
yes.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
yes,
but
there
is
no
way
that
the
child
can
be
legitimated
now
because
the
mother
of
the
child
left
the
father
years
ago.
the
only
way
that
he
could
legitimate
the
child
would
be
to
marry
the
child’s
mother.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
it’s
not
certain
that
he
could
adopt
the
child,
your
honor,
but
he
certainly
--
he
could
attempt
to
adopt
the
child.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
i
think
that
the
child
would
be
eligible
if
he
did
that.
however,
there
is
--
it
isn’t
clear
that
he
could
adopt
him
and
the
secretary
has
suggested
that
the
purpose
of
this
entire
section
is
to
discourage
the
manipulation
of
events
solely
in
order
to
obtain
benefits.
and
if
he
were
to
adopt
this
child
for
no
other
reason
than
to
obtain
benefits,
surely,
this
would
be
the
kind
of
manipulation
of
events
that
the
secretary
says
the
section
is
meant
to
prevent.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
if
he
were
not
to
adopt
him?
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
then
there
would
be
no
other
way
except
to
remove
this
bar.
that’s
true,
your
honor.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
he’s
--
the
secretary’s?
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
i
hope
not,
your
honor.
however,
in
stanley
versus
illinois,
i
believe
that
this
court
stated
that
to
force
a
father
to
adopt
his
natural
child
in
order
to
go
around
a
burden
that
was
placed
on
him
only
as
the
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
would
be
an
unjust
and
arbitrary
burden
to
place
on
him
when
a
father
of
a
legitimate
child
in
a
similar
situation
would
not
have
this
burden.
it’s
also
true,
your
honor,
that
this
--
that
the
father
of
the
children
in
this
case
is
an
elderly,
disabled,
impecunious
gentleman,
and
it’s
not
certain
that
the
courts
of
illinois
would
allow
him
to
adopt
the
child
for
those
reasons.
the
other
indicia
of
suspectness
that
the
court
pointed
to
was
that
the
--
was
the
saddling
of
a
class
with
disabilities
in
the
history
of
purposeful
unequal
treatment
and
a
position
of
political
powerlessness
so
as
to
command
extraordinary
protection
from
the
majoritarian
political
process.
and
it
is
surely
clear
that
illegitimate
children
are
in
a
situation
of
political
powerlessness,
although
they
are
frequently
legislated
against
as
a
group,
they
have
no
legislative
power
as
a
group.
they
are
a
discrete
and
insular
minority
who
have
no
political
power
to
defend
themselves
against
this
kind
of
arbitrary
--
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
i
think
that
they
have
more
political
power,
your
honor,
because
they
aren’t
discriminated
against
in
this
way.
there
are
situations
in
which
legitimate
children
are
discriminated
against
as
children
as
opposed
to
adults,
but
there
are
more
valid
and
reasonable
distinctions
between
children
and
adults
than
between
children
who
differ
only
because
of
the
marital
status
of
their
parents.
the
children
in
this
situation
--
the
illegitimate
children
are
classified
solely
by
an
accident
of
their
birth,
and
they
cannot
change
it.
they
have
no
control
over
it.
they
have
suffered
as
a
result
of
this
classification,
a
stigma
from
which
they
will
never
recover.
and
stigma
is,
i
believe,
a
characteristic
which
this
court
has
sought
to
counteract
by
granting
stricter
judicial
scrutiny
to
those
classes
of
people
who
have
suffered
from
that
kind
of
stigma,
particularly
in
the
situation
where
the
law
in
question
will
perpetuate
the
stigma
and
perpetuate
the
historical
suffering
of
the
class,
as
this
will
do.
legitimate
siblings
of
these
children
will
be
able
to
receive
benefits.
in
fact,
they
have
legitimate
siblings
who
are
receiving
benefits
and
to
distinguish
between
the
legitimate
and
illegitimate
siblings
is
only
to
perpetrate
the
stigma
that
these
children
must
suffer
because
of
their
parent’s
marital
status.
the
statutory
section
challenged
here
should,
therefore,
be
subject
to
strict
scrutiny
and
be
upheld
only
if
it
is
crucial
to
a
compelling
state
interest
which
it
clearly
is
not.
the
government
has
been
able
to
show
indeed
no
rational
purpose
for
this
classification,
much
less
a
compelling
state
purpose.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
identically
situated
to
children
who
would
be
able
to
receive
benefits,
except
for
the
fact
that
their
father
and
mother
never
married.
and
this
fault,
if
you
will,
of
their
parents
should
not
be
used
to
deprive
them
of
rights
which
they
would
otherwise
have.
i’d
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
jane
g.
stevens
may
it
please
the
court.
i
think
that
the
--
that
counsel
for
the
secretary
has
depended
on
two,
if
i
may
say
so,
flawed
arguments.
the
first
is
that
the
likelihood
--
that
the
purpose
of
this
section
is
to
provide
support
for
those
most
likely
to
have
lost
support.
and
i
think
that
the
clear
fact
that
legitimate
children
born
after
the
onset
of
disability
who
never
had
support
from
current
earnings
are
eligible
must
indicate
that
that
cannot
be
the
purpose
of
this
distinction.
legitimate
children
who
have
had
no
prior
experience
of
support
are
eligible
to
receive
these
benefits.
and
the
other
buttress
of
the
secretary’s
argument
is
that
the
distinction
is
based
on
a
distinction
between
those
who
can
and
those
who
cannot
inherit
under
the
laws
of
intestacy,
and
there
are
two
weaknesses
in
that
argument.
the
first
is
in
the
legislative
history,
in
1965,
when
they
added
this
section
to
the
act,
congress
stated
and
i
would
read
a
quote
to
you
from
senate
report
404
in
1965.
“the
committee
believes
that
in
a
national
program,
that
is
intended
to
pay
benefits
to
replace
support
for
a
child
when
his
father
retires,
dies,
or
becomes
disabled,
whether
a
child
gets
benefits
should
not
depend
on
whether
he
can
inherit
his
father’s
intestate
personal
property
under
the
laws
of
the
state
in
which
his
father
happens
to
live.”
that
was
not,
in
fact,
the
intent
of
congress.
the
purpose
of
adding
section
216
in
the
first
place
was
so
that
this
federal
program
would
not
depend
exclusively
on
the
state
laws
of
intestate
succession.
and
the
other
weakness
of
that
argument
is
that
this
is
not
a
means
for
deciding
who
will
receive
benefits
after
a
wage
earner
dies,
but
who
will
receive
benefits
while
he
is
still
alive
and
would
be,
but
for
his
disability
or
age,
supporting
the
children.
and
therefore,
it
would
be
rational
perhaps
to
depend
on
laws
providing
support,
but
not
on
the
laws
of
intestate
succession.
in
fact,
mr.
jimenez
in
this
case
has
acknowledged
these
children
formally
in
writing
and
they
will
be
eligible
to
receive
benefits
when
he
dies.
and
in
fact,
even
if
he
had
not
acknowledged
them
in
writing,
they
would
be
eligible
to
receive
benefits
when
he
dies
because
he
is
living
with
them
and
living
with
them
is
a
means
to
qualify
under
this
section.
the
likelihood
of
support
is
simply
not
relevant
in
a
section
which
makes
necessary
for
eligibility
acknowledgment
or
a
court
order
which
would
give
a
right
to
support
or
the
experience
of
support
or
“living
with.”
no
one
will
qualify
under
this
section
who
has
not
the
right
to
or
the
experience
of
support,
no
matter
when
he
was
born
in
relation
to
his
father’s
age
or
disability.
and
therefore,
i
think
that
the
argument
on
which
the
secretary
now
apparently
entirely
depends,
is
an
argument
without
merit
and,
therefore,
i
respectfully
request
that
this
exclusion
of
afterborn
children
be
stricken
from
the
section.
thank
you.
