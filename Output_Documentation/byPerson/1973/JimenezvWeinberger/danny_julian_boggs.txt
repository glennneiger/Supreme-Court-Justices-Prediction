mr.
danny
julian
boggs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like,
if
i
might,
to
begin
by
tracing
more
exactly
what
the
statutory
scheme
at
issue
here
is.
i
believe
it
has
become
somewhat
confused
during
the
opposing
argument
and
i
believe
that
it
is
crucial
to
perhaps
the
key
point
of
disagreement
between
the
two
sides
here
which
is
on
the
purpose
of
the
social
security
act
as
a
whole.
we
contend
that
while
any
look
of
the
social
security
act
can
tell
you
that
it
does
not
derive
with
the
aristotelian
logic
from
some
first
principle.
the
basic
purpose
is
to
replace
support
which
was
lost
due
to
the
act
of
disability,
retirement,
or
death.
counsel
opposite
contends
that
to
the
contrary,
that
its
basic
purpose
is
to
pay
people
who
have
a
right
to
support
or
who
have
actual
support.
so,
let
us
look
now
at
what
the
statutory
scheme
actually
says.
it
begins
that
in
order
to
gain
benefits
one
must
be
a
child
and
child
is
then
defined
as,
essentially,
persons
who
may
inherit
under
state
intestacy
laws
as
a
child
which
brings
in
essentially
all
legitimate
children
and
it
brings
in
those
illegitimate
children
who
meet
the
various
state
law
qualifications
which
entitle
them
to
inherit.
in
three
or
four
states,
this
is
any
illegitimate
child
from
the
moment
of
birth.
in
most
states,
i
believe
as
your
honor
asked,
it
requires
some
statutory
action.
it
may
be
merely
a
written
acknowledgment.
it
may
be
merely
open
and
notorious
holding
out.
it
may
require
a
certain
court
action,
but
in
any
event,
the
child
had
to
meet
one
of
these
qualifications.
now,
any
of
these
qualifications
would
give
it
the
right
to
inherit,
which
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief
was
one
of
the
original
indications
of
the
social
security
act.
the
payments
were
made
not
to
persons,
but
to
an
estate
and
that,
specifically,
this
estate
payment
was
phased
out
in
favor
of
continuing
payments
basically
to
those
people
who
could
inherit.
then,
in
1965,
congress
said
“well,
there
are
other
people
who
we
feel
should
be
able
to
get
benefits”
and
despite
an
advisory
counsel
report
which
they
rely
on,
which
did
use
the
phrase
“right
to
support
or
experience
of
support,”
they
wrote
in
specific
statutory
criterion
and
they
said,
“if
before
the
parent
became
entitled,”
that
is
before
he
became
disabled,
before
he
died,
or
before
he
became
actually
64,
i
think,
because
they
wanted
to
give
you
a
one-year
period
before
that
65,
but
if
before
that,
one
of
these
things
has
happened
then
you
can
get
benefits.
if
your
father
acknowledged
you
in
writing.
no
judicial
scrutiny
required,
a
simple
acknowledgment,
if
there
was
a
paternity
order,
if
there
was
a
support
order,
or
if
he
was
living
with
you
or
contributing
to
your
support.
now,
in
any
of
these
cases,
it
could
be
a
reasonable
assumption
or
a
preponderant
assumption
that
you
were
getting
support
at
that
time
and
that,
therefore,
your
lost
support
when
that
event
took
place.
but
i
would
point
out
that
contrary
to
the
argument
made
by
counsel
opposite,
in
the
case
of
the
acknowledgment
or
in
the
case
of
the
simply
“living
with,”
there
is
no
necessary
experience
of
support.
there
is
no
necessary
right
to
support.
there
is,
rather,
the
congressional
judgment
that
this
class
of
people
probably
lost
support.
i
would
further
point
out
that
this
kind
of
judgment
runs
throughout
the
law.
for
example,
legitimate
children
who
would
otherwise
qualify
do
not
qualify,
if
they
were
adopted
by
someone
else
because
in
such
a
case,
i
think
congress
reasonably
judged
that
they
probably
did
not
lose
support.
as
another
example,
children
who
become
married
even
though
they
may
be
under
18,
they
may
still
have
a
right
to
support;
they
may
still
have
an
experience
of
support.
but,
in
judging
that
group,
congress
decided
that
those
people
probably
did
not
lose
support
and,
therefore,
that
class
could
be
excluded.
so
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
general
congressional
scheme
which
can
be
traced,
i
think,
through
categories
of
the
social
security
law
far
outside
children
and
i
think
one
can
examine
almost
any
provision
and
find
this
kind
of
judgment,
which
says
the
question
we
look
at
is
who
is
likely
to
have
lost
support
and
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
not
--
no
illegitimates,
illegitimates
who
fail
any
one
or
all
of
those
four
tests.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
are
all
--
no,
your
honor.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
would
state,
your
honor,
that
the
fact
that
the
--
the
line
i
was
beginning
was
the
real
item
which
needs
to
be
explained
is
not
why
we
deny
payments
to
these
illegitimates
because,
by
definition,
since
they
were
born
after
the
man
became
disabled
they
could
not
have
lost
support
due
to
his
disability.
the
question
rather
is
why
do
we
allow
payments
to
those
persons
who
can
inherit,
which
includes
both
legitimates
and
illegitimates.
and
as
i
have
suggested,
persons
who
can
inherit
under
state
law
essentially
also
suffer
a
loss
that
the
social
security
act,
we
believe,
may
provide
compensation
for
because,
since
the
father
could
not
continue
earning
and
provide
an
estate
since
the
social
security
act
no
longer
adds
to
that
estate
as
it
did
up
until
1939,
those
persons
who
can’t
inherit,
whether
they’re
legitimate
or
illegitimate,
those
persons
who
can’t
inherit
do
suffer
this
loss
for
which
we
believe
there
can
be
compensation.
so
that,
essentially,
we
base
the
reasonableness
of
this
on
two
points.
the
first
is
that
it’s
a
reasonable
judgment
to
say
that,
in
general,
people
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
yes.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
yes,
sir.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
before
he
becomes
disabled.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
not
per
se.
they
may
have
to
meet
one
of
various
tests
which
legitimates
would
not
have
to
meet,
so
the
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
for
example--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
no,
sir.
we
would
suggest
that
it
does
not.
once
the
man
is
disabled
or
dead
or
reaches
age
65
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
it’s
not
in
this
case
but
i
would
suggest
briefly,
your
honor,
that
if
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
if
the
rule
suggested
by
counsel
opposite
were
adopted
which
i
take
it
would
mean
that
any
of
these
tests
could
be
met
after
the
entitling
event,
for
example
a
paternity
order
after
death
would
qualify
a
child.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
alright,
your
honor.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
your
honor,
it
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
it
depends
on
where
he
lives.
first
of
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
in
illinois,
he
has
some
difficulties,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
yes,
sir.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
because,
your
honor,
he
cannot
have
lost
any
support
as
a
result
of
the
disability
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
your
honor,
i
suggest
that
the
social
security
law,
as
with
many
laws
are
replete
with
that
type
of
line.
for
example,
a
widow,
a
wife
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
and
the
reason,
your
honor,
is
that
he
cannot
have
lost
any
support.
if
he
was
born
the
day
before,
he
would
have
had
a
reasonable
expectation
to
have
been
supported
or
lost
support
because
of
that
disability.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
that
is
the
reason
that
we
make
and
perhaps
are
required
to
make
the
additional
argument
with
regard
to
inheritance.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
so
that
this
--
this
we
believe
is
not
simply
a
discrimination
between
a
legitimate
and
an
illegitimate.
it
is
a
discrimination
between
persons
who
can
inherit
and
persons
who
cannot
inherit
a
distinction
in
which
this
court
in
labine
versus
vincent
has
upheld
in
allowing
that
distinction
to
be
based
in
part
upon
the
question
of
legitimacy
of
birth.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
on
the
face
of
that
distinction
that
there
is
no
equal
protection
argue
--
no
equal
protection
problem
with
that,
that
that
arises
in
any
type
of
line
drawing
proposition.
for
example,
if
i
could
give
you
two
other
examples
from
the
law.
one,
we
allude
to
in
our
brief
which
is
that
a
woman
who
is
married
to
a
man
who
dies
within
nine
months
of
their
marriage
cannot
get
widow’s
benefits.
now,
it
is
true
that
at
eight
months
and
thirty
days
i
don’t
know
that
her
dependency
is
any
less
than
at
nine
months
and
one
day.
but,
we
believe
congress
had
a
reasonable
purpose
in
that
case
to
prevent
people
from
getting
benefits
by
marrying
people
essentially
on
their
death
bed
and
you
have
to
draw
a
line.
another
example
which
is
even
closer
to
this
is
as
follows.
a
husband
or
a
parent,
in
order
to
receive
benefits
on
the
account
of
his
wife
or
his
child,
must
have
been
receiving
one-half
of
his
support
at
the
time
of
entitlement,
just
like
in
our
case,
at
the
time
of
disability.
so,
for
example,
a
man
who
is
not
dependent
on
his
wife
when
she
becomes
disabled
but
does
become
dependent
on
her
later,
he
looses
--
he
just
cannot
receive
social
security
benefits,
and
the
reason
is
that
at
the
time
of
her
entitlement,
he
lost
no
support.
if
he
had
been
dependent
on
or
the
day
before
she
became
disabled
or
became
age
65,
he
would
receive
benefits.
now
granted,
in
any
given
case,
the
result
may
appear
harsh.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
any
time
a
person
misses
out
under
just
one
part
of
a
rule,
he
can
easily
say,
as
counsel
does
here,
“we
could
qualify
if
you
would
takeout
this
one
rule.”
but
as
we,
i
believe,
have
shown,
this
distinction
is
one
that
is
rationally
related
to
the
purposes
of
the
social
security
act
which
is
to
replace
support
which
was
lost
at
the
time
the
person
ceased
earning,
that
is
death,
disability,
or
age
65.
we
would
also
like
to
take
issue
with
the
contention
that
the
primary
purpose
of
this
is
merely
administrative
efficiency,
merely
to
prevent
fraud.
they’ve
argued
this
at
quite
considerable
length
and
while
certainly,
we
believe
that
it
has
an
additional
aspect
which
is
that
an
action
such
as
an
acknowledgment
may
more
likely
be
considered
reliable
or
more
likely
considered
valid
if
it
occurs
at
a
time
when
that
action
in
itself
is
not
the
thing
which
creates
an
entitlement
to
benefits
and,
in
addition,
when
that
action
carries
with
it
no
other
accompanying
burdens
or
reasons.
for
example,
in
the
adoption
instance
which
was
alluded
to
somewhat,
the
secretary
would
have
no
objection,
in
fact,
to
an
adoption
where
a
court
scrutiny
would
be
required
that
it
would
be
in
the
child’s
best
interest.
an
adoption
would
also
place
the
parent
under
a
number
of
other
burdens
and
obligations,
and
give
the
child
other
rights
other
than
simply
qualifying
him
for
social
security
benefits.
so
that
in
that
case,
the
statutory
criteria
are
tied
to
other
indicia
which
would
indicate
the
family
relationship.
finally,
the
point
was
argued
that
this
distinction
is
made
only
because
illegitimates
are
less
likely
to
have
received
support
than
legitimates
and,
thereby,
raising
the
idea
that
this
should
be
in
fact
judged
on
an
individual
basis.
but
as
we
have
pointed
out,
it
is
not
a
distinction
generally
between
legitimates
and
illegitimates
on
the
basis
of
their
having
been
likely
to
have
received
support.
those
persons
born
after
a
death,
disability,
or
age
65
could
not
have
received
support,
and
that
is
the
basic
distinction.
then,
those
legitimates
and
those
inheriting
illegitimates
or
people
who
are
legitimated,
who
thereby
become
legitimate
even
if
in
their
state
they
could
not
have
inherited
as
illegitimates,
any
of
those
people
who
thereby
acquire
inheritance
rights,
thereby,
are
also
allowed
to
receive
social
security
benefits.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
that’s
the
primary
basis
on
which
it
relied,
perhaps
the
only
basis
on
which
they
relied,
whether
--
i,
in
fact,
don’t
know
whether
the
argument
we’re
presenting
here
was
presented
in
that
complexity
to
that
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
yes,
i’m
saying
that
that’s
what
one
could
gather
from
their
opinion.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
no,
we
--
i
would
say
that
we
tried
to
present
what
we
believe
is
the
strongest
argument
for
upholding
it,
which
is
the
one
that
we
have
presented
to
day.
certainly,
we
recognize
that
there
are
severe
problems
with
an
argument
based
solely
on
a
discrimination
based
on
a
fraud
rational
when
additional
investigation
may
be
required
in
some
circumstances.
we
think
that
--
however,
when
the
distinction
made
is
based
upon
a
status,
such
as
the
acknowledgment
or
the
contribution
occurring
before
the
entitling
event,
we
believe
that
that
is
not
solely
a
fraud-based
rational,
but
it
is
a
rational
based
on
what
the
basic
entitlement
of
the
social
security
act
is.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
yes,
sir.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
right,
he
does
not
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
he
does
not
recover,
however,
because
of
his
lost
support
at
the
time
of
the
disability.
he
recovers
because
of
his
ability
to
inherit,
that
would
be
our
understanding.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
take
it
that
you’re
then
saying
that,
it
would
appear
to
me
that
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
okay,
we
would
indicate
that
--
as
we
pointed
out
in
talking
about
the
1939
amendments,
at
that
time,
persons
who
could
have
gotten
money
from
the
parent’s
estate,
that
possible
benefit
was
taken
away
and
instead
life
payments
were
made
as
a
substitute
for
that.
so
that
in
our
case,
the
legitimate
and
the
illegitimate
who
can
inherit
in
half
the
states
and
more
if
he
is
legitimated,
that
child
by
the
1939
amendments
lost
his
potentiality
to
get
that
money
from
the
parent’s
estate
and
we
feel
it
was
not
irrational
at
all
for
congress
to
say
that
those
children,
though
perhaps
they
do
not
qualify
under
the
theory
we
just
stated,
also
have
a
right
to
receive
similar
benefits
during
life.
so,
that
would
be
the
way
that
we
make
that
distinction.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
your
honor,
a
death
benefit
would
be
paid.
again,
payments
after
death
would
be
made
to
persons
who
met
the
qualifications
at
the
time
of
death.
so
that,
for
instance,
these
children
would
in
fact
be
able
to
receive
benefits
after
their
wage
earner
died
because
in
that
case,
they
would
have
--
that
assuming
he
meets
the
test
which
is
that
he
was
supporting
them,
he
was
contributing
to
their
support
at
the
time
of
his
death,
those
children
then
did
lose
benefits,
did
lose
support
and
that
class
of
children
probably
would
have
lost
support
as
a
result
of
the
entitling
event.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
no,
your
honor.
they
do
not
inherit,
they
do
not
inherit.
they
receive
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
no,
they
receive
continuing
benefits.
they
receive
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
yes,
they
receive
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
if
he
met
one
of
these
tests.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
because
between
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
no.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
no,
your
honor.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
that’s
the
reason
they
do
not
receive
that
particular
kind
of
benefit,
but
for
example,
if
they
were
not
acknowledged
or
if
he
was
not
contributing
to
them,
they
would
not
receive
the
death
benefits
either.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
alright.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
eugenio
and
alicia
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
if
his
actions
to
date
constitute
an
acknowledgment,
they
would.
if
the
question
is
his
contribution,
then
his
contribution
would
have
to
continue
until
the
time
of
their
death
--
at
the
time
of
his
death.
but,
if
his
actions
to
date
constitute
an
acknowledgment,
then
they
would
receive
social
security
benefits.
we
believe
that
the
indications
that
we
have
set
out
thus
far
do
show
that
the
statute
has,
while
perhaps
not
as
i’ve
indicated,
a
basis
in
aristotelian
logic
from
a
first
principle.
as
this
court
has
said,
in
the
field
of
social
benefits
there
may
be
a
need
for
rough
accommodations
though
they
may
be
somewhat
illogical
under
a
strict
logical
test
or
unscientific.
the
social
--
in
the
social
security
act,
and
not
just
in
the
children
sections,
congress
has
made
many
distinctions
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
wives’
benefits,
in
the
husbands’
benefits
to
try
to
limit
benefits
to
persons
who
probably
had
lost
support.
as
yet
another
example,
children
beyond
the
age
of
18
when
they
may
have
no
right
to
support,
when
they
may
have
no
experience
of
support
individually
still
receive
benefits
if
they
are
students
because
congress
has
judged
that,
on
the
whole,
those
people
are
more
likely
to
have
been
supported.
now,
a
21-year-old
who
is
not
a
student
cannot
come
in
and
offer
proof
that
he
was
supported,
cannot
offer
proof
of
his
individual
dependency
because
congress
has
made
the
judgment
that
that
is
the
classification
that
is
to
be
made.
and
so,
we
would
urge
upon
the
court
here
that
this
is
not,
in
fact,
a
distinction
made
against
illegitimate
children
on
the
grounds
of
their
illegitimacy.
it
is
a
distinction
made,
first,
between
those
who
are
likely
to
have
lost
support
and
those
who
are
not
likely
to
have
lost
support
at
the
time
of
the
entitling
event.
and
that,
secondly,
it
is
a
payment
which
is
made
to
persons
who
can
inherit
under
valid
state
laws
and
who,
thereby,
suffer
a
loss
which
we
believe
congress
is
entitled
to
compensate
for.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
yes,
sir.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
believe
that
it
does.
certainly,
after
this
court’s
decision
in
gomez,
any
state
which
requires
a
legitimate
child
to
be
supported,
which
is
virtually
all
of
the
states,
would
require
the
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
to
support
it.
and
that,
of
course
is
one
reason
why
if
the
court
follows
the
rational
that
a
right
to
support
is
all
that
is
needed,
then
every
illegitimate
child
whether
there
had
ever
been
any
contact
with
the
father
from
the
moment
--
ever
since
the
moment
of
conception,
would
also
be
entitled
to
benefits.
and
that,
of
course,
is
the
norton
case
which
is
presently
pending
on
a
jurisdictional
statement
here.
and
that
is
why
that
if
the
true
gravamen
is
that
you
can
never
say
legitimate
is
different
from
illegitimate,
then
not
only
these
children
would
receive
benefits,
but
children
who
had
never
had
any
contact
with
the
father.
so
that
the
--
and
as
we
indicated
running
across
the
law,
there’s
the
feeling
that
right
to
support
is
not
sufficient.
it
may
frequently
coincide,
but
is
not
in
itself,
a
sufficient
nor
the
basis
of
the
social
security
act’s
benefit
payments.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like,
if
i
might,
to
begin
by
tracing
more
exactly
what
the
statutory
scheme
at
issue
here
is.
i
believe
it
has
become
somewhat
confused
during
the
opposing
argument
and
i
believe
that
it
is
crucial
to
perhaps
the
key
point
of
disagreement
between
the
two
sides
here
which
is
on
the
purpose
of
the
social
security
act
as
a
whole.
we
contend
that
while
any
look
of
the
social
security
act
can
tell
you
that
it
does
not
derive
with
the
aristotelian
logic
from
some
first
principle.
the
basic
purpose
is
to
replace
support
which
was
lost
due
to
the
act
of
disability,
retirement,
or
death.
counsel
opposite
contends
that
to
the
contrary,
that
its
basic
purpose
is
to
pay
people
who
have
a
right
to
support
or
who
have
actual
support.
so,
let
us
look
now
at
what
the
statutory
scheme
actually
says.
it
begins
that
in
order
to
gain
benefits
one
must
be
a
child
and
child
is
then
defined
as,
essentially,
persons
who
may
inherit
under
state
intestacy
laws
as
a
child
which
brings
in
essentially
all
legitimate
children
and
it
brings
in
those
illegitimate
children
who
meet
the
various
state
law
qualifications
which
entitle
them
to
inherit.
in
three
or
four
states,
this
is
any
illegitimate
child
from
the
moment
of
birth.
in
most
states,
i
believe
as
your
honor
asked,
it
requires
some
statutory
action.
it
may
be
merely
a
written
acknowledgment.
it
may
be
merely
open
and
notorious
holding
out.
it
may
require
a
certain
court
action,
but
in
any
event,
the
child
had
to
meet
one
of
these
qualifications.
now,
any
of
these
qualifications
would
give
it
the
right
to
inherit,
which
as
we
have
indicated
in
our
brief
was
one
of
the
original
indications
of
the
social
security
act.
the
payments
were
made
not
to
persons,
but
to
an
estate
and
that,
specifically,
this
estate
payment
was
phased
out
in
favor
of
continuing
payments
basically
to
those
people
who
could
inherit.
then,
in
1965,
congress
said
“well,
there
are
other
people
who
we
feel
should
be
able
to
get
benefits”
and
despite
an
advisory
counsel
report
which
they
rely
on,
which
did
use
the
phrase
“right
to
support
or
experience
of
support,”
they
wrote
in
specific
statutory
criterion
and
they
said,
“if
before
the
parent
became
entitled,”
that
is
before
he
became
disabled,
before
he
died,
or
before
he
became
actually
64,
i
think,
because
they
wanted
to
give
you
a
one-year
period
before
that
65,
but
if
before
that,
one
of
these
things
has
happened
then
you
can
get
benefits.
if
your
father
acknowledged
you
in
writing.
no
judicial
scrutiny
required,
a
simple
acknowledgment,
if
there
was
a
paternity
order,
if
there
was
a
support
order,
or
if
he
was
living
with
you
or
contributing
to
your
support.
now,
in
any
of
these
cases,
it
could
be
a
reasonable
assumption
or
a
preponderant
assumption
that
you
were
getting
support
at
that
time
and
that,
therefore,
your
lost
support
when
that
event
took
place.
but
i
would
point
out
that
contrary
to
the
argument
made
by
counsel
opposite,
in
the
case
of
the
acknowledgment
or
in
the
case
of
the
simply
“living
with,”
there
is
no
necessary
experience
of
support.
there
is
no
necessary
right
to
support.
there
is,
rather,
the
congressional
judgment
that
this
class
of
people
probably
lost
support.
i
would
further
point
out
that
this
kind
of
judgment
runs
throughout
the
law.
for
example,
legitimate
children
who
would
otherwise
qualify
do
not
qualify,
if
they
were
adopted
by
someone
else
because
in
such
a
case,
i
think
congress
reasonably
judged
that
they
probably
did
not
lose
support.
as
another
example,
children
who
become
married
even
though
they
may
be
under
18,
they
may
still
have
a
right
to
support;
they
may
still
have
an
experience
of
support.
but,
in
judging
that
group,
congress
decided
that
those
people
probably
did
not
lose
support
and,
therefore,
that
class
could
be
excluded.
so
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
general
congressional
scheme
which
can
be
traced,
i
think,
through
categories
of
the
social
security
law
far
outside
children
and
i
think
one
can
examine
almost
any
provision
and
find
this
kind
of
judgment,
which
says
the
question
we
look
at
is
who
is
likely
to
have
lost
support
and
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
not
--
no
illegitimates,
illegitimates
who
fail
any
one
or
all
of
those
four
tests.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
are
all
--
no,
your
honor.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
would
state,
your
honor,
that
the
fact
that
the
--
the
line
i
was
beginning
was
the
real
item
which
needs
to
be
explained
is
not
why
we
deny
payments
to
these
illegitimates
because,
by
definition,
since
they
were
born
after
the
man
became
disabled
they
could
not
have
lost
support
due
to
his
disability.
the
question
rather
is
why
do
we
allow
payments
to
those
persons
who
can
inherit,
which
includes
both
legitimates
and
illegitimates.
and
as
i
have
suggested,
persons
who
can
inherit
under
state
law
essentially
also
suffer
a
loss
that
the
social
security
act,
we
believe,
may
provide
compensation
for
because,
since
the
father
could
not
continue
earning
and
provide
an
estate
since
the
social
security
act
no
longer
adds
to
that
estate
as
it
did
up
until
1939,
those
persons
who
can’t
inherit,
whether
they’re
legitimate
or
illegitimate,
those
persons
who
can’t
inherit
do
suffer
this
loss
for
which
we
believe
there
can
be
compensation.
so
that,
essentially,
we
base
the
reasonableness
of
this
on
two
points.
the
first
is
that
it’s
a
reasonable
judgment
to
say
that,
in
general,
people
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
yes.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
yes,
sir.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
before
he
becomes
disabled.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
not
per
se.
they
may
have
to
meet
one
of
various
tests
which
legitimates
would
not
have
to
meet,
so
the
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
for
example--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
no,
sir.
we
would
suggest
that
it
does
not.
once
the
man
is
disabled
or
dead
or
reaches
age
65
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
it’s
not
in
this
case
but
i
would
suggest
briefly,
your
honor,
that
if
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
if
the
rule
suggested
by
counsel
opposite
were
adopted
which
i
take
it
would
mean
that
any
of
these
tests
could
be
met
after
the
entitling
event,
for
example
a
paternity
order
after
death
would
qualify
a
child.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
alright,
your
honor.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
your
honor,
it
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
it
depends
on
where
he
lives.
first
of
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
in
illinois,
he
has
some
difficulties,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
yes,
sir.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
because,
your
honor,
he
cannot
have
lost
any
support
as
a
result
of
the
disability
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
your
honor,
i
suggest
that
the
social
security
law,
as
with
many
laws
are
replete
with
that
type
of
line.
for
example,
a
widow,
a
wife
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
and
the
reason,
your
honor,
is
that
he
cannot
have
lost
any
support.
if
he
was
born
the
day
before,
he
would
have
had
a
reasonable
expectation
to
have
been
supported
or
lost
support
because
of
that
disability.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
that
is
the
reason
that
we
make
and
perhaps
are
required
to
make
the
additional
argument
with
regard
to
inheritance.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
so
that
this
--
this
we
believe
is
not
simply
a
discrimination
between
a
legitimate
and
an
illegitimate.
it
is
a
discrimination
between
persons
who
can
inherit
and
persons
who
cannot
inherit
a
distinction
in
which
this
court
in
labine
versus
vincent
has
upheld
in
allowing
that
distinction
to
be
based
in
part
upon
the
question
of
legitimacy
of
birth.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
on
the
face
of
that
distinction
that
there
is
no
equal
protection
argue
--
no
equal
protection
problem
with
that,
that
that
arises
in
any
type
of
line
drawing
proposition.
for
example,
if
i
could
give
you
two
other
examples
from
the
law.
one,
we
allude
to
in
our
brief
which
is
that
a
woman
who
is
married
to
a
man
who
dies
within
nine
months
of
their
marriage
cannot
get
widow’s
benefits.
now,
it
is
true
that
at
eight
months
and
thirty
days
i
don’t
know
that
her
dependency
is
any
less
than
at
nine
months
and
one
day.
but,
we
believe
congress
had
a
reasonable
purpose
in
that
case
to
prevent
people
from
getting
benefits
by
marrying
people
essentially
on
their
death
bed
and
you
have
to
draw
a
line.
another
example
which
is
even
closer
to
this
is
as
follows.
a
husband
or
a
parent,
in
order
to
receive
benefits
on
the
account
of
his
wife
or
his
child,
must
have
been
receiving
one-half
of
his
support
at
the
time
of
entitlement,
just
like
in
our
case,
at
the
time
of
disability.
so,
for
example,
a
man
who
is
not
dependent
on
his
wife
when
she
becomes
disabled
but
does
become
dependent
on
her
later,
he
looses
--
he
just
cannot
receive
social
security
benefits,
and
the
reason
is
that
at
the
time
of
her
entitlement,
he
lost
no
support.
if
he
had
been
dependent
on
or
the
day
before
she
became
disabled
or
became
age
65,
he
would
receive
benefits.
now
granted,
in
any
given
case,
the
result
may
appear
harsh.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
any
time
a
person
misses
out
under
just
one
part
of
a
rule,
he
can
easily
say,
as
counsel
does
here,
“we
could
qualify
if
you
would
takeout
this
one
rule.”
but
as
we,
i
believe,
have
shown,
this
distinction
is
one
that
is
rationally
related
to
the
purposes
of
the
social
security
act
which
is
to
replace
support
which
was
lost
at
the
time
the
person
ceased
earning,
that
is
death,
disability,
or
age
65.
we
would
also
like
to
take
issue
with
the
contention
that
the
primary
purpose
of
this
is
merely
administrative
efficiency,
merely
to
prevent
fraud.
they’ve
argued
this
at
quite
considerable
length
and
while
certainly,
we
believe
that
it
has
an
additional
aspect
which
is
that
an
action
such
as
an
acknowledgment
may
more
likely
be
considered
reliable
or
more
likely
considered
valid
if
it
occurs
at
a
time
when
that
action
in
itself
is
not
the
thing
which
creates
an
entitlement
to
benefits
and,
in
addition,
when
that
action
carries
with
it
no
other
accompanying
burdens
or
reasons.
for
example,
in
the
adoption
instance
which
was
alluded
to
somewhat,
the
secretary
would
have
no
objection,
in
fact,
to
an
adoption
where
a
court
scrutiny
would
be
required
that
it
would
be
in
the
child’s
best
interest.
an
adoption
would
also
place
the
parent
under
a
number
of
other
burdens
and
obligations,
and
give
the
child
other
rights
other
than
simply
qualifying
him
for
social
security
benefits.
so
that
in
that
case,
the
statutory
criteria
are
tied
to
other
indicia
which
would
indicate
the
family
relationship.
finally,
the
point
was
argued
that
this
distinction
is
made
only
because
illegitimates
are
less
likely
to
have
received
support
than
legitimates
and,
thereby,
raising
the
idea
that
this
should
be
in
fact
judged
on
an
individual
basis.
but
as
we
have
pointed
out,
it
is
not
a
distinction
generally
between
legitimates
and
illegitimates
on
the
basis
of
their
having
been
likely
to
have
received
support.
those
persons
born
after
a
death,
disability,
or
age
65
could
not
have
received
support,
and
that
is
the
basic
distinction.
then,
those
legitimates
and
those
inheriting
illegitimates
or
people
who
are
legitimated,
who
thereby
become
legitimate
even
if
in
their
state
they
could
not
have
inherited
as
illegitimates,
any
of
those
people
who
thereby
acquire
inheritance
rights,
thereby,
are
also
allowed
to
receive
social
security
benefits.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
that’s
the
primary
basis
on
which
it
relied,
perhaps
the
only
basis
on
which
they
relied,
whether
--
i,
in
fact,
don’t
know
whether
the
argument
we’re
presenting
here
was
presented
in
that
complexity
to
that
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
yes,
i’m
saying
that
that’s
what
one
could
gather
from
their
opinion.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
no,
we
--
i
would
say
that
we
tried
to
present
what
we
believe
is
the
strongest
argument
for
upholding
it,
which
is
the
one
that
we
have
presented
to
day.
certainly,
we
recognize
that
there
are
severe
problems
with
an
argument
based
solely
on
a
discrimination
based
on
a
fraud
rational
when
additional
investigation
may
be
required
in
some
circumstances.
we
think
that
--
however,
when
the
distinction
made
is
based
upon
a
status,
such
as
the
acknowledgment
or
the
contribution
occurring
before
the
entitling
event,
we
believe
that
that
is
not
solely
a
fraud-based
rational,
but
it
is
a
rational
based
on
what
the
basic
entitlement
of
the
social
security
act
is.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
yes,
sir.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
right,
he
does
not
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
he
does
not
recover,
however,
because
of
his
lost
support
at
the
time
of
the
disability.
he
recovers
because
of
his
ability
to
inherit,
that
would
be
our
understanding.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
would
suggest
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
well,
your
honor
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
take
it
that
you’re
then
saying
that,
it
would
appear
to
me
that
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
okay,
we
would
indicate
that
--
as
we
pointed
out
in
talking
about
the
1939
amendments,
at
that
time,
persons
who
could
have
gotten
money
from
the
parent’s
estate,
that
possible
benefit
was
taken
away
and
instead
life
payments
were
made
as
a
substitute
for
that.
so
that
in
our
case,
the
legitimate
and
the
illegitimate
who
can
inherit
in
half
the
states
and
more
if
he
is
legitimated,
that
child
by
the
1939
amendments
lost
his
potentiality
to
get
that
money
from
the
parent’s
estate
and
we
feel
it
was
not
irrational
at
all
for
congress
to
say
that
those
children,
though
perhaps
they
do
not
qualify
under
the
theory
we
just
stated,
also
have
a
right
to
receive
similar
benefits
during
life.
so,
that
would
be
the
way
that
we
make
that
distinction.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
your
honor,
a
death
benefit
would
be
paid.
again,
payments
after
death
would
be
made
to
persons
who
met
the
qualifications
at
the
time
of
death.
so
that,
for
instance,
these
children
would
in
fact
be
able
to
receive
benefits
after
their
wage
earner
died
because
in
that
case,
they
would
have
--
that
assuming
he
meets
the
test
which
is
that
he
was
supporting
them,
he
was
contributing
to
their
support
at
the
time
of
his
death,
those
children
then
did
lose
benefits,
did
lose
support
and
that
class
of
children
probably
would
have
lost
support
as
a
result
of
the
entitling
event.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
no,
your
honor.
they
do
not
inherit,
they
do
not
inherit.
they
receive
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
no,
they
receive
continuing
benefits.
they
receive
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
yes,
they
receive
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
if
he
met
one
of
these
tests.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
because
between
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
no.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
no,
your
honor.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
that’s
the
reason
they
do
not
receive
that
particular
kind
of
benefit,
but
for
example,
if
they
were
not
acknowledged
or
if
he
was
not
contributing
to
them,
they
would
not
receive
the
death
benefits
either.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
alright.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
eugenio
and
alicia
--
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
if
his
actions
to
date
constitute
an
acknowledgment,
they
would.
if
the
question
is
his
contribution,
then
his
contribution
would
have
to
continue
until
the
time
of
their
death
--
at
the
time
of
his
death.
but,
if
his
actions
to
date
constitute
an
acknowledgment,
then
they
would
receive
social
security
benefits.
we
believe
that
the
indications
that
we
have
set
out
thus
far
do
show
that
the
statute
has,
while
perhaps
not
as
i’ve
indicated,
a
basis
in
aristotelian
logic
from
a
first
principle.
as
this
court
has
said,
in
the
field
of
social
benefits
there
may
be
a
need
for
rough
accommodations
though
they
may
be
somewhat
illogical
under
a
strict
logical
test
or
unscientific.
the
social
--
in
the
social
security
act,
and
not
just
in
the
children
sections,
congress
has
made
many
distinctions
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
wives’
benefits,
in
the
husbands’
benefits
to
try
to
limit
benefits
to
persons
who
probably
had
lost
support.
as
yet
another
example,
children
beyond
the
age
of
18
when
they
may
have
no
right
to
support,
when
they
may
have
no
experience
of
support
individually
still
receive
benefits
if
they
are
students
because
congress
has
judged
that,
on
the
whole,
those
people
are
more
likely
to
have
been
supported.
now,
a
21-year-old
who
is
not
a
student
cannot
come
in
and
offer
proof
that
he
was
supported,
cannot
offer
proof
of
his
individual
dependency
because
congress
has
made
the
judgment
that
that
is
the
classification
that
is
to
be
made.
and
so,
we
would
urge
upon
the
court
here
that
this
is
not,
in
fact,
a
distinction
made
against
illegitimate
children
on
the
grounds
of
their
illegitimacy.
it
is
a
distinction
made,
first,
between
those
who
are
likely
to
have
lost
support
and
those
who
are
not
likely
to
have
lost
support
at
the
time
of
the
entitling
event.
and
that,
secondly,
it
is
a
payment
which
is
made
to
persons
who
can
inherit
under
valid
state
laws
and
who,
thereby,
suffer
a
loss
which
we
believe
congress
is
entitled
to
compensate
for.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
yes,
sir.
mr.
danny
julian
boggs
i
believe
that
it
does.
certainly,
after
this
court’s
decision
in
gomez,
any
state
which
requires
a
legitimate
child
to
be
supported,
which
is
virtually
all
of
the
states,
would
require
the
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
to
support
it.
and
that,
of
course
is
one
reason
why
if
the
court
follows
the
rational
that
a
right
to
support
is
all
that
is
needed,
then
every
illegitimate
child
whether
there
had
ever
been
any
contact
with
the
father
from
the
moment
--
ever
since
the
moment
of
conception,
would
also
be
entitled
to
benefits.
and
that,
of
course,
is
the
norton
case
which
is
presently
pending
on
a
jurisdictional
statement
here.
and
that
is
why
that
if
the
true
gravamen
is
that
you
can
never
say
legitimate
is
different
from
illegitimate,
then
not
only
these
children
would
receive
benefits,
but
children
who
had
never
had
any
contact
with
the
father.
so
that
the
--
and
as
we
indicated
running
across
the
law,
there’s
the
feeling
that
right
to
support
is
not
sufficient.
it
may
frequently
coincide,
but
is
not
in
itself,
a
sufficient
nor
the
basis
of
the
social
security
act’s
benefit
payments.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
