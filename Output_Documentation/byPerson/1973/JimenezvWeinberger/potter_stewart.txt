yes.
justice

in

in

the

has
the

it

of

illegitimate

justice

alright.
justice
potter
stewart
mr.
boggs,
the
district
court
in
this
case
upheld
that
this
legislation
solely,
as
i
read
its
opinion
upon
the
proposition
that
is
designed
to
prevent
fraud.
do
you
read
its
opinion
that
way?
justice
potter
stewart
no,
i’m
referring
just
to
their
opinion,
to
the
court’s
opinion.
justice
potter
stewart
and
you
haven’t
spent
--
maybe
i
missed
it,
you
haven’t
devoted
much
time
on
your
argument
to
that.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
except
i
think
that
you’ve
agree
that
the
justification
for
legislation
that
would
be
based
upon
the
support
not
having
been
available
prior
the
event
has
nothing
to
do
with
legitimacy
or
illegitimacy.
it
just
has
to
do
with
being
afterborn?
justice
potter
stewart
and,
therefore,
that
certainly
doesn’t
support
this
legislation,
does
it?
because
it
doesn’t
--
it’s
wholly
irrelevant
to
legitimacy
or
illegitimacy.
in
other
words,
an
afterborn
legitimate
child
who’s
never
had
any
support
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
by
definition
because
he
hasn’t
been
in
existence,
he
fully
shares
under
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
but
he
gets
--
justice
potter
stewart
but
if
the
hypothesis
is
that
he’s
never
had
any
support,
never
had
any
expectation
or
fact
of
support
since
he
wasn’t
in
existence
and
hadn’t
been
born
that
cuts
across
legitimate
and
illegitimate
children.
it’s
equally
true
of
both.
and
i
don’t
see
how
you
can
argue
that
it
supports
this
distinction
between
legitimate
and
illegitimate
children.
justice

fact--
justice
