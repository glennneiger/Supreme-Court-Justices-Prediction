justice
potter
stewart
yes,
i
will
announce
these
opinions
in
the
order
in
which
the
case
were
docketed
in
this
court.
the
first
one
then
will
be
72-1660,
the
case
stanley
blackledge,
warden
against
jimmy
seth
perry.
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
convicted
in
a
north
carolina
court
of
limited
jurisdiction
upon
a
misdemeanor
charge.
he
exercised
his
right
to
appeal
and
secure
an
automatic
new
trial
in
a
higher
state
court.
the
state
countered
by
bringing
a
felony
charge
against
him
in
the
higher
court
based
upon
the
same
conduct
that
had
been
the
subject
of
the
misdemeanor
charge.
he
pleaded
guilty
and
was
given
a
longer
prison
sentence
than
had
originally
been
imposed
for
the
misdemeanor
conviction.
a
federal
district
court
granted
habeas
corpus
that
its
judgment
was
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
the
written
opinion
filed
today,
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
for
the
state
to
up
the
ante
after
the
respondent
appealed
his
original
misdemeanor
conviction.
accordingly
we
affirm
the
judgment
before
us.
mr.
justice
rehnquist
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
mr.
justice
powell
also
dissents
upon
one
of
the
grounds
relied
upon
by
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
