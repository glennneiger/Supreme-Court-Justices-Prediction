justice

h.
rehnquist
i?m
having
a
little
bit
of
difficulty
hearing
you.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
he
ever
go
to
trial
on
the
misdemeanor
charge?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
had
the
trial
court
granted
the
first
motion?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
ordinarily
have
a
preliminary
hearing
before
the
solicitor
takes
the
case
to
the
grand
jury
in
north
carolina?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
granted

don?t
you
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
granted
in
double
jeopardy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
green
was
a
case
in
the
federal
system,
wasn?t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
correct,
in
the
district
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
your
de
novo
appeal
to
the
superior
court
on
your
misdemeanor,
i
take
it,
it?s
then
up
to
the
state
to
reinstitute
to
prosecution
all
over
again
in
the
superior
court?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn?t
the
question
of
a
hearing
on
the
record
of
the
defendant,
having
to
take
the
initiative
to
bring
the
case
to
the
court?s
attention?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
he
was
never
sentenced
as
a
result
of
the
district
court?s
judgment.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
that
vacated
the
thing
without
more.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
was
never
charged
in
the
superior
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
not
with
the
crime
he
was
charged
with
in
district
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
says
as
a
separate
offense.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it?s
a
novel
term,
?a
greater
included
offense.?
the
state
says
the
elements
of
the
crime
tried
in
the
superior
court
were
different
than
the
elements
of
the
crime
tried
in
the
district
court.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
neither
tollett
nor
mcmann
certainly
spoke
in
terms
of
conscious
decision
and
consultation.
they
said
that
once
you
have
the
guilty
plea,
that?s
the
end
of
it
so
far
as
everything
that
antedated
the
guilty
plea
regardless
of
any
waiver
type
test
like
having
your
right
of
counsel
cases.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
was
no
legitimate
interest
if
there
was
double
jeopardy.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
judge
larkins
rule
on
the
boykin

claim
or
did
he
just
not
reach
it?
