unknown
speaker
is
the
state?s
position
that
there
was
double
jeopardy
but
that
it
was
waived
or
why
was
it
even
double
jeopardy
in
the
first
place?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
it
seems
to
me
like
that?s
a
threshold
sort
of
consideration.
you
don?t
need
to
get
to
waiver
if
there
were
any
double
jeopardy
in
the
first
place.
unknown
speaker
it
waives
the
constitutional
question.
unknown
speaker
but
why
would
it
be
a
double
jeopardy
here?
unknown
speaker
well
then
what
was
the
--
what?s
the
double
jeopardy
involved
now
unknown
speaker
we
have
a
different
offense
with
different
elements.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
double
jeopardy
was
--
it
wasn?t
double
jeopardy
if
it?s
a
different
crime
that
he?s
tried
for
a
second
time.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
there
was
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
not?
well,
let?s
see
if
i
got
this
correctly.
he
was
convicted
initially
on
a
misdemeanor
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon,
and
he
appealed
that.
and,
had
he
been
successful
on
the
appeal,
he
would
have
had
a
trial
de
novo
on
the
misdemeanor
charge.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
other
words,
when
--
he
appealed
the
misdemeanor
charge,
didn?t
he?
unknown
speaker
and
was
he
tried
de
novo
on
the
misdemeanor
charge?
unknown
speaker
no,
because
intervening
the
trial
de
novo
was
the
indictment
on
the
felony
charge?
unknown
speaker
and
what?s
the
difference
between
the
elements
of
the
felony
offense
and
the
elements
of
the
misdemeanor
offense?
unknown
speaker
what
were
they?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
it
was
the
same
event,
wasn?t
it?
unknown
speaker
except
that
the
--
on
the
condition
of
the
victim
was
the
same
in
respect
to
the
trial
on
the
misdemeanor
charge
as
it
was
in
respect
to
the
trial
on
the
felony
charge,
wasn?t
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
it?s
the
only
thing
that
happened.
well,
then,
why
isn?t
it
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
he
didn?t
need
any
different
evidence
on
the
felony
charge
and
you
had
to
--
state
had
to
introduce
it
on
the
misdemeanor
charge.
well,
you
had
to
have
some
help
but
since
you
do
not--
unknown
speaker
why?
i
thought
you
said
the
condition
of
the
victim
was
exactly
the
same.
unknown
speaker
its
vindictive
then
to
say
but
the
evidence
is
required
to
prove.
well,
what
different
evidence
did
you
have
on
the
felony
trial
that
you
didn?t
introduce
in
the
misdemeanor
charge?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
well,
i?m
reading
from
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
i?m
reading
from
your
brief,
and
it?s
your
brief
that
says
he
was
initially
tried
and
convicted
in
august
1969
on
the
misdemeanor
assault.
he
appealed
it.
and
then,
you
say
perry
appealed
this
assault
conviction
in
the
superior
court
and
received
a
trial
de
novo.
unknown
speaker
well
when
you
got
a
--
however,
during
interim,
between
appeal
and
trial
de
novo,
the
solicitor
obtained
an
indictment?
unknown
speaker
charging
him
with
a
felony?
unknown
speaker
and
he
pleaded
guilty
to
that.
unknown
speaker
well
then
i
would
misread
what
you
say
--
and
he
received
a
trial
de
novo?
he
did
not,
in
fact,
receive
one.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
trial
de
novo
on
the
misdemeanor
charge.
that
was
--
unknown
speaker
that
was
on
the
trial
of
the
summary
charge.
unknown
speaker
what
would
he
have
been
indicted
for
--
if
he
hadn?t
appealed
his
misdemeanor
conviction?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
why
could
he
have
not
been
indicted
for
it
though?
unknown
speaker
if
they
have
the
state
law,
they
won?t?
unknown
speaker
what?s
then?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
to
prove
something
in
addition
to
prove
the
point.
unknown
speaker
that?s
--
is
that
state
double
jeopardy
law
or
is
it
statutory
law
or
what?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
decision
of
your
supreme
court
that
supports
that
proposition?
unknown
speaker
that
it
would
say
that
if
this
misdemeanor
judgment
had
not
been
appealed,
this
individual
could
not
have
been
indicted
for
the
felony?
unknown
speaker
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
in
one
of
your
briefs?
unknown
speaker
it
will
be
double
jeopardy,
would
it
not?
if
a
person
were
tried
and
convicted
for
man
slaughter,
he
couldn?t
then
be
indicted
for
first-degree
murder
in
that
court
or
any
other
court
for
precisely
the
same
killing,
could
he,
without
violating
the
double
jeopardy
clause
whether
in
your
state
or
in
other
states?
unknown
speaker
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
my
understanding,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
and
that
--
there
couldn?t
have
been
a
felony
charge
in
that
court?
unknown
speaker
he
could
not
have
been
tried
there.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
lost
me
there.
you
said
the
solicitor
asked
the
judge
if
he
could
go
up
on
the
felony.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
unknown
speaker
he?s
been
convicted
of
the
misdemeanor.
unknown
speaker
and
sentenced.
unknown
speaker
and
appealed.
and
an
appeal
sets
aside
that
conviction
and
sentence,
does
it
not,
automatically?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
do
you
mean
by
?judge,
can
i
go
up
on
the
felony??
what?s
that
mean?
unknown
speaker
why
did
he
have
to
ask
the
district
judge?s
permission?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
i
know
that?s
your
contention,
but
why
do
you
suppose
he
thought
he
had
to
ask
anybody?s
permission?
unknown
speaker
meaning
that
this
is
a
preliminary
hearing,
that
is
it?
unknown
speaker
did
the
judge
then
have
a
preliminary
hearing?
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
receiving
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
provision
court
under
north
carolina
law?
unknown
speaker
and
then
bound
him
over
to
the
supreme
court.
unknown
speaker
they
did
both,
sort
of?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
they
tried
him
and
convicted
him
on
a
misdemeanor
--
unknown
speaker
and
then
they,
more
or
less,
had
a
preliminary
hearing
and
bound
him
over
on
the
felony.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
no
bound,
no
new
evidence.
did
they
enter
--
did
the
judge
enter
any
kind
of
order?
unknown
speaker
have
you
have
some
authority
on
whether
or
not
federal
authority
or
--
unknown
speaker
green?
well,
he
was
never
charged
with
the
--
he
was
never
charged
with
the
felony
but
he
was
first
tried
with
misdemeanor.
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
green?
unknown
speaker
there?s
no
case
that
you
could
cite.
unknown
speaker
well,
it?s
not
here.
we
have
many
cases
here.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
he
was
never
acquitted.
he
was
neither
convicted
nor
acquitted
in
the
felony.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
was
never
--
he
was
tried
for
the
misdemeanor.
he
was
never
either
acquitted
or
convicted
at
the
felony.
unknown
speaker
he
couldn?t
have
been
tried
for
felony.
unknown
speaker
when
was
he
ever
tried,
convicted,
or
acquitted
of
a
felony
twice?
unknown
speaker
to
make
an
election
as
to
what
they
could
have
tried
him
for
both
in
the
first
instance.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
could
have,
i
suppose,
have
one
--
you
think
this
one
was
a
lesser
included
offense?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
it
could?ve
tried
him
for
both
of
them
then
in
the
--
not
in
the
lower
court
but
in
the
court
in
which
he
appealed.
unknown
speaker
no?
suppose
the
state
had
tried
out
--
started
out
from
the
felony
charge?
unknown
speaker
and
then
indicted
at
the
superior
court.
now,
they
would?ve
tried
him
with
a
felony
and
they
could
have
found
him
guilty
in
the
lesser
event.
unknown
speaker
so
they
would
--
could?ve
tried
him
for
both
of
them.
unknown
speaker
he
could
not
have
been
convicted,
i
gather,
on
the
felony
indictment
in
both
of
the
felony
and
the
misdemeanor.
unknown
speaker
he
could?ve
been
convicted
of
the
felony
or
the
jury
could?ve
convicted
him
of
the
misdemeanor.
unknown
speaker
they
tried
him
on
the
felony
and
the
jury
convicted
him
with
the
misdemeanor.
certainly
then,
he
could
not
be
tried
again
for
felony.
like
in
green.
unknown
speaker
you?re
saying,
in
effect,
that
they?d
done
the
same
--
attempted
the
same
thing
as
they
went
through
within
green.
unknown
speaker
well
i
gather
your
brother
agrees,
at
least
under
north
carolina
law,
they
could
not
have
tried
him
on
the
felony
charge
had
he
not
appealed
the
misdemeanor
conviction.
as
i
understood
his
argument,
it?s
that
they
could
try
him
on
the
felony
charge
because
of
his
appeal
from
the
misdemeanor
conviction
reopened.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
north
carolina
--
is
it
a
constitutional
rule
or
a
statutory
rule,
or
a
rule
of
practice,
or
what?
if
you
assume
he
had
to
appeal
from
his
misdemeanor
conviction.
unknown
speaker
but
actually,
what
powers
are
articulated
in
north
carolina,
just
as
a
rule
of
practice?
unknown
speaker
as
long
as
the
misdemeanor
conviction
stands,
they
just
don?t
charge
him
the
felony.
unknown
speaker
that?s
their
practice?
unknown
speaker
but
you
also
submit
that
that?s
--
that
practice
is
required
by
the
united
states
constitution.
unknown
speaker
and
as
my
brother
brennan
suggested,
i
understood
your
opponent
here
to
agree
with
you
if
the
case
were
that
the
original
misdemeanor
conviction
had
been
unappealed,
had
been
undisturbed.
i
think
the
representative
of
the
attorney
general
of
your
state
says
?yes,
in
that
case,
we
would
not,?
and
i
understood
him
to
say
?we
could
not
then
bring
a
felony
prosecution
for
precisely
the
same
event.?
unknown
speaker
and
the
only
question
is
whether
that
rule
is
different
or
this
appears
when,
at
the
defendant?s
behest,
the
original
conviction
was
set
aside.
unknown
speaker
well,
that?s
a
different
point.
that?s
not
a
double
jeopardy
point.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
you?re
saying
is
it?s
a
burden
on
appeal.
unknown
speaker
slightly
defeated
or
attempt
to
the
state
to
hear
by
then
bringing
in
a
felony
charge.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
maximum
sentence
if
he
was
subject
to
a
misdemeanor?
unknown
speaker
what
did
he
get
on
the
felony?
unknown
speaker
before
you
--
excuse
me,
i
apologize
for
interrupting
you
but
i?m
curious.
does
the
record
show
or
do
you
know
why,
after
having
pleaded
not
guilty
to
a
misdemeanor,
he
then
pleaded
guilty
to
a
felony?
unknown
speaker
but
you
told
us
that
at
the
earlier
stage,
the
first
trial,
the
man
who
was
cut
would
not
testify
--
unknown
speaker
well,
why
did
he
plead
guilty?
unknown
speaker
oh!
it
was
a
plead
bargain.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
greater
included,
what?s
that?
unknown
speaker
and
they
were,
weren?t
they?
unknown
speaker
which
you
didn?t
have
to
prove
in
the
misdemeanor
trial.
unknown
speaker
and
on
de
novo,
misdemeanor
trial
would
not
have
to
prove
either?
unknown
speaker
but
i
gather
had
he
got
his
de
novo
superior
court
trial
--
it
is
superior
court,
isn?t
it,
in
the
state?
unknown
speaker
he
ran
the
risk
of
getting
his
sentence
increased
if
found
guilty
by
the
jury
from
six
months
to
two
years.
unknown
speaker
whereas,
what
in
fact
happened
to
him
instead
of
--
he
could?ve
got
up
not
more
than
two
years
instead
of
which
he
gets
five
years
and
seven
months.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
five
to
seven
years?
unknown
speaker
does
the
state
have
the
option
of
starting
a
misdemeanor
trial
for
you?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
if
the
defendant
says
to
his
lawyer
?well,
could
i
get
tried
with
felony??
and
he
says
?well,
that?s
an
unsettled
issue.
it?s
about
50-50
i
would
guess
in
the
supreme
court.
i
don?t
know
whether
you?d
win
or
not
but,
now,
we
got
to
make
a
choice.?
now,
the
prosecutor
says
?we?ll
--
we
could
have
a
deal
on
two
years
if
you
plead
guilty.?
now,
it
may
be
that
you
shouldn?t
plead
guilty
at
all.
we
could
win
on
double
jeopardy.
the
prosecutor
doesn?t
think
its
double
jeopardy.
i
think
it
is,
but
i
don?t
know
whether
i
am
right.
unknown
speaker
he
doesn?t
have
a
guilty
plea
but
it
was
based
on
in
or
after
adequate
representation
by
counsel?
unknown
speaker
if
you
were
representing
a
defendant
and
you
were
assured
of
your
double
jeopardy
point,
as
you
are
here,
you
would
never
permit
him
to
plead
guilty.
unknown
speaker
now,
still
in
brady
and
plus
the
other
cases
suggest
that
perhaps
these
cases
are
the
ones
with
guilty
please
and
then
you
turn
it
to
a
representation
of
counsel
case.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
in
the
view
of
the
state
and
the
law
that
the
attorney
representing
mr.
perry
was
--
furnished
inadequate
representations
by
permitting
him
to
plead
guilty?
unknown
speaker
it?s
hard
for
you
to
find
the
case
that
would
also
support
your
view,
isn?t
it?
unknown
speaker
is
the
state?s
position
that
there
was
double
jeopardy
but
that
it
was
waived
or
why
was
it
even
double
jeopardy
in
the
first
place?
unknown
speaker
i
know.
it
seems
to
me
like
that?s
a
threshold
sort
of
consideration.
you
don?t
need
to
get
to
waiver
if
there
were
any
double
jeopardy
in
the
first
place.
unknown
speaker
it
waives
the
constitutional
question.
unknown
speaker
but
why
would
it
be
a
double
jeopardy
here?
unknown
speaker
well
then
what
was
the
--
what?s
the
double
jeopardy
involved
now
unknown
speaker
we
have
a
different
offense
with
different
elements.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
double
jeopardy
was
--
it
wasn?t
double
jeopardy
if
it?s
a
different
crime
that
he?s
tried
for
a
second
time.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
there
was
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
not?
well,
let?s
see
if
i
got
this
correctly.
he
was
convicted
initially
on
a
misdemeanor
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon,
and
he
appealed
that.
and,
had
he
been
successful
on
the
appeal,
he
would
have
had
a
trial
de
novo
on
the
misdemeanor
charge.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
other
words,
when
--
he
appealed
the
misdemeanor
charge,
didn?t
he?
unknown
speaker
and
was
he
tried
de
novo
on
the
misdemeanor
charge?
unknown
speaker
no,
because
intervening
the
trial
de
novo
was
the
indictment
on
the
felony
charge?
unknown
speaker
and
what?s
the
difference
between
the
elements
of
the
felony
offense
and
the
elements
of
the
misdemeanor
offense?
unknown
speaker
what
were
they?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
it
was
the
same
event,
wasn?t
it?
unknown
speaker
except
that
the
--
on
the
condition
of
the
victim
was
the
same
in
respect
to
the
trial
on
the
misdemeanor
charge
as
it
was
in
respect
to
the
trial
on
the
felony
charge,
wasn?t
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
it?s
the
only
thing
that
happened.
well,
then,
why
isn?t
it
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
he
didn?t
need
any
different
evidence
on
the
felony
charge
and
you
had
to
--
state
had
to
introduce
it
on
the
misdemeanor
charge.
well,
you
had
to
have
some
help
but
since
you
do
not--
unknown
speaker
why?
i
thought
you
said
the
condition
of
the
victim
was
exactly
the
same.
unknown
speaker
its
vindictive
then
to
say
but
the
evidence
is
required
to
prove.
well,
what
different
evidence
did
you
have
on
the
felony
trial
that
you
didn?t
introduce
in
the
misdemeanor
charge?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
well,
i?m
reading
from
your
brief.
unknown
speaker
i?m
reading
from
your
brief,
and
it?s
your
brief
that
says
he
was
initially
tried
and
convicted
in
august
1969
on
the
misdemeanor
assault.
he
appealed
it.
and
then,
you
say
perry
appealed
this
assault
conviction
in
the
superior
court
and
received
a
trial
de
novo.
unknown
speaker
well
when
you
got
a
--
however,
during
interim,
between
appeal
and
trial
de
novo,
the
solicitor
obtained
an
indictment?
unknown
speaker
charging
him
with
a
felony?
unknown
speaker
and
he
pleaded
guilty
to
that.
unknown
speaker
well
then
i
would
misread
what
you
say
--
and
he
received
a
trial
de
novo?
he
did
not,
in
fact,
receive
one.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
trial
de
novo
on
the
misdemeanor
charge.
that
was
--
unknown
speaker
that
was
on
the
trial
of
the
summary
charge.
unknown
speaker
what
would
he
have
been
indicted
for
--
if
he
hadn?t
appealed
his
misdemeanor
conviction?
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
why
could
he
have
not
been
indicted
for
it
though?
unknown
speaker
if
they
have
the
state
law,
they
won?t?
unknown
speaker
what?s
then?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
to
prove
something
in
addition
to
prove
the
point.
unknown
speaker
that?s
--
is
that
state
double
jeopardy
law
or
is
it
statutory
law
or
what?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
decision
of
your
supreme
court
that
supports
that
proposition?
unknown
speaker
that
it
would
say
that
if
this
misdemeanor
judgment
had
not
been
appealed,
this
individual
could
not
have
been
indicted
for
the
felony?
unknown
speaker
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
in
one
of
your
briefs?
unknown
speaker
it
will
be
double
jeopardy,
would
it
not?
if
a
person
were
tried
and
convicted
for
man
slaughter,
he
couldn?t
then
be
indicted
for
first-degree
murder
in
that
court
or
any
other
court
for
precisely
the
same
killing,
could
he,
without
violating
the
double
jeopardy
clause
whether
in
your
state
or
in
other
states?
unknown
speaker
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
my
understanding,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
and
that
--
there
couldn?t
have
been
a
felony
charge
in
that
court?
unknown
speaker
he
could
not
have
been
tried
there.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
lost
me
there.
you
said
the
solicitor
asked
the
judge
if
he
could
go
up
on
the
felony.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
unknown
speaker
he?s
been
convicted
of
the
misdemeanor.
unknown
speaker
and
sentenced.
unknown
speaker
and
appealed.
and
an
appeal
sets
aside
that
conviction
and
sentence,
does
it
not,
automatically?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
do
you
mean
by
?judge,
can
i
go
up
on
the
felony??
what?s
that
mean?
unknown
speaker
why
did
he
have
to
ask
the
district
judge?s
permission?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
i
know
that?s
your
contention,
but
why
do
you
suppose
he
thought
he
had
to
ask
anybody?s
permission?
unknown
speaker
meaning
that
this
is
a
preliminary
hearing,
that
is
it?
unknown
speaker
did
the
judge
then
have
a
preliminary
hearing?
unknown
speaker
what
kind
of
receiving
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
provision
court
under
north
carolina
law?
unknown
speaker
and
then
bound
him
over
to
the
supreme
court.
unknown
speaker
they
did
both,
sort
of?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
they
tried
him
and
convicted
him
on
a
misdemeanor
--
unknown
speaker
and
then
they,
more
or
less,
had
a
preliminary
hearing
and
bound
him
over
on
the
felony.
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
no
bound,
no
new
evidence.
did
they
enter
--
did
the
judge
enter
any
kind
of
order?
unknown
speaker
have
you
have
some
authority
on
whether
or
not
federal
authority
or
--
unknown
speaker
green?
well,
he
was
never
charged
with
the
--
he
was
never
charged
with
the
felony
but
he
was
first
tried
with
misdemeanor.
unknown
speaker
is
that
in
green?
unknown
speaker
there?s
no
case
that
you
could
cite.
unknown
speaker
well,
it?s
not
here.
we
have
many
cases
here.
unknown
speaker
(inaudible)
unknown
speaker
but
he
was
never
acquitted.
he
was
neither
convicted
nor
acquitted
in
the
felony.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
was
never
--
he
was
tried
for
the
misdemeanor.
he
was
never
either
acquitted
or
convicted
at
the
felony.
unknown
speaker
he
couldn?t
have
been
tried
for
felony.
unknown
speaker
when
was
he
ever
tried,
convicted,
or
acquitted
of
a
felony
twice?
unknown
speaker
to
make
an
election
as
to
what
they
could
have
tried
him
for
both
in
the
first
instance.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
could
have,
i
suppose,
have
one
--
you
think
this
one
was
a
lesser
included
offense?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
it
could?ve
tried
him
for
both
of
them
then
in
the
--
not
in
the
lower
court
but
in
the
court
in
which
he
appealed.
unknown
speaker
no?
suppose
the
state
had
tried
out
--
started
out
from
the
felony
charge?
unknown
speaker
and
then
indicted
at
the
superior
court.
now,
they
would?ve
tried
him
with
a
felony
and
they
could
have
found
him
guilty
in
the
lesser
event.
unknown
speaker
so
they
would
--
could?ve
tried
him
for
both
of
them.
unknown
speaker
he
could
not
have
been
convicted,
i
gather,
on
the
felony
indictment
in
both
of
the
felony
and
the
misdemeanor.
unknown
speaker
he
could?ve
been
convicted
of
the
felony
or
the
jury
could?ve
convicted
him
of
the
misdemeanor.
unknown
speaker
they
tried
him
on
the
felony
and
the
jury
convicted
him
with
the
misdemeanor.
certainly
then,
he
could
not
be
tried
again
for
felony.
like
in
green.
unknown
speaker
you?re
saying,
in
effect,
that
they?d
done
the
same
--
attempted
the
same
thing
as
they
went
through
within
green.
unknown
speaker
well
i
gather
your
brother
agrees,
at
least
under
north
carolina
law,
they
could
not
have
tried
him
on
the
felony
charge
had
he
not
appealed
the
misdemeanor
conviction.
as
i
understood
his
argument,
it?s
that
they
could
try
him
on
the
felony
charge
because
of
his
appeal
from
the
misdemeanor
conviction
reopened.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
north
carolina
--
is
it
a
constitutional
rule
or
a
statutory
rule,
or
a
rule
of
practice,
or
what?
if
you
assume
he
had
to
appeal
from
his
misdemeanor
conviction.
unknown
speaker
but
actually,
what
powers
are
articulated
in
north
carolina,
just
as
a
rule
of
practice?
unknown
speaker
as
long
as
the
misdemeanor
conviction
stands,
they
just
don?t
charge
him
the
felony.
unknown
speaker
that?s
their
practice?
unknown
speaker
but
you
also
submit
that
that?s
--
that
practice
is
required
by
the
united
states
constitution.
unknown
speaker
and
as
my
brother
brennan
suggested,
i
understood
your
opponent
here
to
agree
with
you
if
the
case
were
that
the
original
misdemeanor
conviction
had
been
unappealed,
had
been
undisturbed.
i
think
the
representative
of
the
attorney
general
of
your
state
says
?yes,
in
that
case,
we
would
not,?
and
i
understood
him
to
say
?we
could
not
then
bring
a
felony
prosecution
for
precisely
the
same
event.?
unknown
speaker
and
the
only
question
is
whether
that
rule
is
different
or
this
appears
when,
at
the
defendant?s
behest,
the
original
conviction
was
set
aside.
unknown
speaker
well,
that?s
a
different
point.
that?s
not
a
double
jeopardy
point.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
you?re
saying
is
it?s
a
burden
on
appeal.
unknown
speaker
slightly
defeated
or
attempt
to
the
state
to
hear
by
then
bringing
in
a
felony
charge.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
maximum
sentence
if
he
was
subject
to
a
misdemeanor?
unknown
speaker
what
did
he
get
on
the
felony?
unknown
speaker
before
you
--
excuse
me,
i
apologize
for
interrupting
you
but
i?m
curious.
does
the
record
show
or
do
you
know
why,
after
having
pleaded
not
guilty
to
a
misdemeanor,
he
then
pleaded
guilty
to
a
felony?
unknown
speaker
but
you
told
us
that
at
the
earlier
stage,
the
first
trial,
the
man
who
was
cut
would
not
testify
--
unknown
speaker
well,
why
did
he
plead
guilty?
unknown
speaker
oh!
it
was
a
plead
bargain.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
greater
included,
what?s
that?
unknown
speaker
and
they
were,
weren?t
they?
unknown
speaker
which
you
didn?t
have
to
prove
in
the
misdemeanor
trial.
unknown
speaker
and
on
de
novo,
misdemeanor
trial
would
not
have
to
prove
either?
unknown
speaker
but
i
gather
had
he
got
his
de
novo
superior
court
trial
--
it
is
superior
court,
isn?t
it,
in
the
state?
unknown
speaker
he
ran
the
risk
of
getting
his
sentence
increased
if
found
guilty
by
the
jury
from
six
months
to
two
years.
unknown
speaker
whereas,
what
in
fact
happened
to
him
instead
of
--
he
could?ve
got
up
not
more
than
two
years
instead
of
which
he
gets
five
years
and
seven
months.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
five
to
seven
years?
unknown
speaker
does
the
state
have
the
option
of
starting
a
misdemeanor
trial
for
you?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
if
the
defendant
says
to
his
lawyer
?well,
could
i
get
tried
with
felony??
and
he
says
?well,
that?s
an
unsettled
issue.
it?s
about
50-50
i
would
guess
in
the
supreme
court.
i
don?t
know
whether
you?d
win
or
not
but,
now,
we
got
to
make
a
choice.?
now,
the
prosecutor
says
?we?ll
--
we
could
have
a
deal
on
two
years
if
you
plead
guilty.?
now,
it
may
be
that
you
shouldn?t
plead
guilty
at
all.
we
could
win
on
double
jeopardy.
the
prosecutor
doesn?t
think
its
double
jeopardy.
i
think
it
is,
but
i
don?t
know
whether
i
am
right.
unknown
speaker
he
doesn?t
have
a
guilty
plea
but
it
was
based
on
in
or
after
adequate
representation
by
counsel?
unknown
speaker
if
you
were
representing
a
defendant
and
you
were
assured
of
your
double
jeopardy
point,
as
you
are
here,
you
would
never
permit
him
to
plead
guilty.
unknown
speaker
now,
still
in
brady
and
plus
the
other
cases
suggest
that
perhaps
these
cases
are
the
ones
with
guilty
please
and
then
you
turn
it
to
a
representation
of
counsel
case.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
in
the
view
of
the
state
and
the
law
that
the
attorney
representing
mr.
perry
was
--
furnished
inadequate
representations
by
permitting
him
to
plead
guilty?
unknown
speaker
it?s
hard
for
you
to
find
the
case
that
would
also
support
your
view,
isn?t
it?
