mr.
richard
n.
league
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
dick
league
from
raleigh,
north
carolina
to
argue
this
case
for
the
petitioners.
before
i
begin
an
argument,
i?d
like
to
apologize
having
each
of
you
for
the
shabby
condition,
i
understand
the
briefs
and
records
that
came
up
before
you.
i
hope
you
accept
my
apologies
in
that
regard
and
that
it
won?t
let
you
change
your
view
of
the
case
too
bad.
this
case
presents
two
issues
to
the
court
for
decision.
first,
whether
or
not
double
jeopardy
is
a
matter
that
would
be
waived
by
a
voluntary
and
intelligent
plea
of
guilty
and,
secondly,
if
the
record
in
this
case
is
good
enough
to
show
that
such
plea
was
made
here
once
voluntarily
and
intelligently.
the
facts
on
which
this
arises
are
as
briefly
as
follows.
jimmy
seth
perry
was
tried
in
the
lower
level
of
our
two-tier
system
in
north
carolina,
the
district
court,
on
a
warrant
charging
him
with
misdemeanor
assault.
after
conviction
there
and
sentenced
to
a
consecutive
six
months
sentence,
he
appealed
to
the
superior
court
division,
the
higher
division
of
the
two-tier
system
in
which
there
is
a
trial
by
jury.
he
appealed
for
trial
de
novo
as
a
matter
of
right.
prior
to
the
case
coming
on
to
be
called
later,
the
solicitor
obtained
an
indictment
charging
him
with
a
higher
grade
of
the
offense,
felony
assault.
and
to
this,
he
pled
and
received
a
sentence
in
the
superior
court
of
some
five
to
seven
years,
however,
this
sentence
was
consecutive
to
the
sentence
he
had.
at
the
time
he
made
the
plea
and,
accordingly,
the
actual
extension
of
time
beyond
the
six
months
consecutive
sentence
he
received
below
something
like
about
three-and-a
half
months
at
that
time.
subsequently,
in
this
proceeding
in
the
eastern
district,
he
obtained
habeas
corpus
relief
on
the
issue
of
pretrial
credit
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
i?m
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i?m
definitely
sorry.
right.
i
tend
to
say
and
point
in
the
facts
as
i
had
just
mentioned,
your
honor,
was
that
the
five
to
seven-year
sentence
concurrent
with
the
sentence
he
was
then
serving
operated
to
giving
him
about
a
three-and-a
half
month
increase
over
the
six-month
consecutive
sentence
he?d
received
in
district
court,
until
the
time
of
this
action
when
he
received
pretrial
credit
on
the
first
penalty
which
created
a
greater
disparity
between
the
two.
in
my
position,
briefly,
on
the
first
issue
is
that
double
jeopardy
is
a
matter
which
would
be
waived
as
an
independent
basis
of
collateral
attack
by
virtue
of
his
guilty
plea
in
this
case.
and
he
can
only
use
that
in
a
habeas
corpus
action
as
evidence
of
some
other
basis
for
relief
such
as,
in
effect,
of
the
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
keenan
has
suggested
to
you
that
you
ought
to
adopt
a
system-related,
guilt-related
distinction
with
regard
to
determining
whether
or
not
such
waiver
has
been
made
in
any
given
case.
but
i
argue
that
you
should
not
accept
that,
and
it?s
not
always
clear
just
what
is
guilt
and
what
is
system-related.
in
fact,
part
of
the
rationale,
as
i
understand
it,
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
to
prevent
punishment,
the
conviction
of
the
innocent
through
repeated
prosecutions.
it?s
according
that,
i
think,
this
right
would
definitely
partake
both
being
a
system-related
right
and
a
right
which
is
guilt-related
as
well.
mr.
richard
n.
league
to
prevent
one
of
the
basis
for
the
prohibition
against
that,
your
honor,
is
to
prevent
the
likelihood
of
the
conviction
of
the
innocent
through
repeated
prosecutions.
so,
in
that
sense,
i
would
view
it
as
possibly
guilt.
mr.
richard
n.
league
sir?
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
believe
it
is
in
benton
v.
maryland.
i
believe
it?s
in
green.
mr.
richard
n.
league
just
what
i
said,
your
honor,
that
one
of
the
rational
--
one
of
the
parts
of
the
rationale
against
double
jeopardy
is
what
i
have
said.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir,
but
i?m
going
beyond
what
it
says.
mr.
richard
n.
league
the
statute
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
sir?
mr.
richard
n.
league
no,
sir.
i
believe
it
has
been
stated
in
those
decisions
that
part
of
the
rationale
underlying
the
prohibition
on
double
jeopardy
is
a
possibility
of
conviction
of
the
innocent
through
repeated
prosecutions.
now,
that?s
not
the
only
part
prior
to
that,
i
believe,
in
the
quotation.
it?s
something
like
relief
of
anxiety,
embarrassment,
and
ordeal.
the
state
with
all
its
resources
should
not
be
permitted
multiple
attempts.
all
these
things
are
mentioned
there
and
i
do
recall
that
they
are
in
both
the
benton
and
the
green
decisions.
perhaps
i?m
wrong
on
the
latter,
but
i
believe
i?m
right
on
the
former.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir?
mr.
richard
n.
league
i?m
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
am
terribly
sorry.
in
addition,
as
a
second
reason,
i
would
urge
upon
you
for
rejecting
the
system
and
guilt-related
distinction
as
the
basis
for
waiver
is
that
as
you
look
at
the
things
that
are
normally
not
waived
by
a
guilty
plea
such
things
as
mental
incompetence,
coercion,
ineffective
assistance,
failure
to
plea,
you
see
that
while
they
are,
in
some
sense,
system-related
they
also
have
a
common
factor
which
isn?t
present
in
this
case.
and
i
think
that
common
factor
is
that
in
none
of
those
cases
is
a
plea,
a
reliable
indicator
that
there
may
be
a
valid
basis
for
it.
certainly
in
perry?s
case,
if
we
are
just
to
throw
aside
his
accusations
or
his
allegations,
pardon
me
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
your
honor,
i
don?t
agree
that
it
was
but
the
thrust
of
my
argument
would
be,
you
wouldn?t
have
to
reach
that
because
it
would
be
waived
by
the
plea.
mr.
richard
n.
league
well,
i
understand
you
avoid
the
constitutional
question
if
possible
so
you
go
to
the
waiver.
mr.
richard
n.
league
well,
i
guess
so,
your
honor.
at
initial
outlook,
it
looked
less
of
a
constitutional
question
than
double
jeopardy.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
don?t
think
it
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
n.
league
that?s
true.
i
don?t
believe
in
it.
mr.
richard
n.
league
double
jeopardy,
according
to
judge
larkins,
is
the
raising
of
the
offense.
and
between
the
initial
trial
in
the
lower
court
and
the
subsequent
trial
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
that?s
why
he
claim
--
judge
larkins
held
it
was
double
jeopardy.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
don?t
know
that,
your
honor.
i
wouldn?t
have
thought
it
was
double
jeopardy
in
this
case.
though,
just
by
virtue
of
the
states
bringing
forth
the
higher
degree
of
the
crime
for
which
they
could
have
initially
tried
him,
at
least
in
terms
of
a
probable
cause
here,
at
the
first
level.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
say
there
was
not.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no,
sir.
he
automatically
got
a
trial
de
novo.
now,
the
normal
expectation
would
have
been
that
it
would?ve
been
on
the
misdemeanor
charge.
but,
in
the
interim,
the
solicitor
obtained
an
indictment
charging
the
higher
offense.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
two
additional
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
n.
league
one
was
inflicting
serious
injuries
and
the
other
intent
to
kill.
to
my
recollection,
they
weren?t.
mr.
richard
n.
league
the
same
event,
the
same
person,
the
same
acts.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
your
honor,
i
don?t
think
it?s
double
jeopardy
because
the
thing
is
no
real
risk
of
jeopardy
in
this
lower
system
unless
the
man
accepts
that
he
can
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes.
mr.
richard
n.
league
well,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
it?s
a
practical
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
your
honor,
there
was
no
felony
trial
but
we
don?t
have
the
record,
we
don?t
have
the
record
of
the
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
district
court.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
understand
he
did
from
his
allegations,
your
honor.
the
district
court
records
were
gone
when
we
filed
our
return
so
we?re
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
in
the
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir.
we
pled
guilty
at
the
trial
de
novo,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
that
much
i
know,
yes.
mr.
richard
n.
league
right.
mr.
richard
n.
league
he
received
a
trial
de
novo
at
which
he
pled
guilty.
no
evidence
was
put
on
this
time.
mr.
richard
n.
league
that
was
on
the
event.
mr.
richard
n.
league
that
was
on
the
event,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
n.
league
intent
and
serious
bodily
injury.
mr.
richard
n.
league
right.
the
proof
of
what
--
it
may
have
been
the
same
in
either
but
it
would
have
to
also
meet
the
requirements
to
sustain
those
two
elements.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
would
say
so.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
but
i
would
not
attach
perhaps
the
same
significance
to
it
as
your
honor.
this
well
could
have
been
an
event
where
they
tried
to
get
it
out
of
the
way
down
below
in
the
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
think,
your
honor,
under
state
law
at
least
it
would?ve
become
final
within
10
days.
it?s
only
voidable
at
the
instance
of
the
defendant.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
well,
i
think
because
of
the
greater
offense
and
lesser
offense
aspect
of
that.
mr.
richard
n.
league
in
the
state
law,
at
least,
your
honor,
if
you
tried
for
the
same
act
and
it
would
--
the
elements
of
the
offense
of
the
lesser
one
would
also
be
elements
of
the
offense
of
the
greater
one
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
then
you
couldn?t
retry.
mr.
richard
n.
league
even
though
that
were
the
case.
mr.
richard
n.
league
it
would
be
state
law.
it
well,
may
well
be
federal
also,
your
honor.
but
i
know
it
is
at
least,
state.
mr.
richard
n.
league
what
i?ve
just
said
about
the
lesser
included
offense?
mr.
richard
n.
league
well,
there?s
an
old
exception.
the
state
cases
state
v.
burke
which
mr.
keenan
brings
out.
mr.
richard
n.
league
sir?
mr.
richard
n.
league
it?s
in
his
brief.
yes,
sir.
as
an
early
?50s
case,
it
relies
i
don?t
know
whether
directly
or
the
interior
sites
within
rely
on
one
of
the
philippine
island
cases
decided
by
this
case
back
in
the
early
1900s.
now,
whether
or
not
that?s
still
a
viable
exception,
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
n.
league
and
that?s
what
i
would
i
say.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
that?s
what
i
understand.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i?m
sorry
for
that,
your
honor.
my
voice
has
no
carriage.
i
knew
that.
returning
to
why
this
matter
should
or
should
not
be
waived,
i
would
just
say
that
in
reference
to
these
things
that
we
now
are
not
waived
there?s
no
dispute
about
whether
or
not
they?re
not
waived.
they
seem
to
have
at
least
one
common
factor
which
is
absent
from
this
case,
and
that
is
that
the
plea
is
not
a
reliable
indicator
that
a
valid
basis
for
it
exists.
here,
if
we
cutout
perry?s
allegations
that
he
pled
to
receive
a
totally
concurrent
sentences
with
his
expectation,
we
see
that
he
traded
an
argument
over
double
jeopardy
for
a
sentence
of
about
three-and-a
half
months.
so
i
think,
under
that
basis,
it
could
well
be
assumed
that
there
was
a
basis
for
the
plea
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
no,
sir.
i
don?t
think
pearce
is
applicable
to
this
case
by
virtue
of
really
what
was
said
in
the
colten
decision
that
the
possibility
for
vindictive
punishment
does
not
occur
sufficiently
within
the
two-tier
system
to
warrant
the
imposition
of
the
prophylactic
rule
in
pearce.
and
in
any
given
case,
your
honor,
you
could
view
the
case
but
that?s
not
the
incidence
of
it
to
warrant
the
placing
of
the
pearce
restrictions
on
this
type
of
situation.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir,
you
would.
mr.
richard
n.
league
in
the
former.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
think
you
don?t
get
it,
your
honor,
because
there?s
no
real
risk
of
punishment
inherent
in
the
double
jeopardy
system.
you
have
to
have
that
risk,
and
you
don?t
have
it
in
the
lower
district
court
so
long
as
the
plea
is
voidable
by
the
defendant
and
--
pardon
me,
the
verdict
is
voidable
by
the
defendant.
that
would
be
my
impression
of
the
case.
it
was
also
suggested,
i
believe,
that
a
basis
would
be,
from
judge
larkins?
standpoint,
was
that
the
reason
was
there
--
pardon
me,
the
right
was
fundamental.
i
don?t
think
much
need
to
be
said
about
that.
they?re
all
that
way
and
i
believe
this
court
rejected
that
idea
recently
in
the
school
taxation
cases.
it?s
true
that
if
sustained
this
plea
could
bar
the
prosecution
entirely,
but
that
would
be
the
case,
i
think,
with
any
given
constitutional
right
in
a
particular
case.
and
lastly,
the
retroactive
decision
idea
of
mr.
keenan,
i
had
thought,
would
not
aid
him
if
we
won
on
his
major
contention
it
wouldn?t
be
any
necessity
to
come
to
this
and,
if
he
did
not,
it
wouldn?t
help.
absent
any
questions,
i?ll
rest
there
and
thank
you
very
much
for
your
attention.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no,
your
honor.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
n.
league
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
dick
league
from
raleigh,
north
carolina
to
argue
this
case
for
the
petitioners.
before
i
begin
an
argument,
i?d
like
to
apologize
having
each
of
you
for
the
shabby
condition,
i
understand
the
briefs
and
records
that
came
up
before
you.
i
hope
you
accept
my
apologies
in
that
regard
and
that
it
won?t
let
you
change
your
view
of
the
case
too
bad.
this
case
presents
two
issues
to
the
court
for
decision.
first,
whether
or
not
double
jeopardy
is
a
matter
that
would
be
waived
by
a
voluntary
and
intelligent
plea
of
guilty
and,
secondly,
if
the
record
in
this
case
is
good
enough
to
show
that
such
plea
was
made
here
once
voluntarily
and
intelligently.
the
facts
on
which
this
arises
are
as
briefly
as
follows.
jimmy
seth
perry
was
tried
in
the
lower
level
of
our
two-tier
system
in
north
carolina,
the
district
court,
on
a
warrant
charging
him
with
misdemeanor
assault.
after
conviction
there
and
sentenced
to
a
consecutive
six
months
sentence,
he
appealed
to
the
superior
court
division,
the
higher
division
of
the
two-tier
system
in
which
there
is
a
trial
by
jury.
he
appealed
for
trial
de
novo
as
a
matter
of
right.
prior
to
the
case
coming
on
to
be
called
later,
the
solicitor
obtained
an
indictment
charging
him
with
a
higher
grade
of
the
offense,
felony
assault.
and
to
this,
he
pled
and
received
a
sentence
in
the
superior
court
of
some
five
to
seven
years,
however,
this
sentence
was
consecutive
to
the
sentence
he
had.
at
the
time
he
made
the
plea
and,
accordingly,
the
actual
extension
of
time
beyond
the
six
months
consecutive
sentence
he
received
below
something
like
about
three-and-a
half
months
at
that
time.
subsequently,
in
this
proceeding
in
the
eastern
district,
he
obtained
habeas
corpus
relief
on
the
issue
of
pretrial
credit
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
i?m
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i?m
definitely
sorry.
right.
i
tend
to
say
and
point
in
the
facts
as
i
had
just
mentioned,
your
honor,
was
that
the
five
to
seven-year
sentence
concurrent
with
the
sentence
he
was
then
serving
operated
to
giving
him
about
a
three-and-a
half
month
increase
over
the
six-month
consecutive
sentence
he?d
received
in
district
court,
until
the
time
of
this
action
when
he
received
pretrial
credit
on
the
first
penalty
which
created
a
greater
disparity
between
the
two.
in
my
position,
briefly,
on
the
first
issue
is
that
double
jeopardy
is
a
matter
which
would
be
waived
as
an
independent
basis
of
collateral
attack
by
virtue
of
his
guilty
plea
in
this
case.
and
he
can
only
use
that
in
a
habeas
corpus
action
as
evidence
of
some
other
basis
for
relief
such
as,
in
effect,
of
the
assistance
of
counsel.
mr.
keenan
has
suggested
to
you
that
you
ought
to
adopt
a
system-related,
guilt-related
distinction
with
regard
to
determining
whether
or
not
such
waiver
has
been
made
in
any
given
case.
but
i
argue
that
you
should
not
accept
that,
and
it?s
not
always
clear
just
what
is
guilt
and
what
is
system-related.
in
fact,
part
of
the
rationale,
as
i
understand
it,
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
to
prevent
punishment,
the
conviction
of
the
innocent
through
repeated
prosecutions.
it?s
according
that,
i
think,
this
right
would
definitely
partake
both
being
a
system-related
right
and
a
right
which
is
guilt-related
as
well.
mr.
richard
n.
league
to
prevent
one
of
the
basis
for
the
prohibition
against
that,
your
honor,
is
to
prevent
the
likelihood
of
the
conviction
of
the
innocent
through
repeated
prosecutions.
so,
in
that
sense,
i
would
view
it
as
possibly
guilt.
mr.
richard
n.
league
sir?
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
believe
it
is
in
benton
v.
maryland.
i
believe
it?s
in
green.
mr.
richard
n.
league
just
what
i
said,
your
honor,
that
one
of
the
rational
--
one
of
the
parts
of
the
rationale
against
double
jeopardy
is
what
i
have
said.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir,
but
i?m
going
beyond
what
it
says.
mr.
richard
n.
league
the
statute
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
sir?
mr.
richard
n.
league
no,
sir.
i
believe
it
has
been
stated
in
those
decisions
that
part
of
the
rationale
underlying
the
prohibition
on
double
jeopardy
is
a
possibility
of
conviction
of
the
innocent
through
repeated
prosecutions.
now,
that?s
not
the
only
part
prior
to
that,
i
believe,
in
the
quotation.
it?s
something
like
relief
of
anxiety,
embarrassment,
and
ordeal.
the
state
with
all
its
resources
should
not
be
permitted
multiple
attempts.
all
these
things
are
mentioned
there
and
i
do
recall
that
they
are
in
both
the
benton
and
the
green
decisions.
perhaps
i?m
wrong
on
the
latter,
but
i
believe
i?m
right
on
the
former.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir?
mr.
richard
n.
league
i?m
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
am
terribly
sorry.
in
addition,
as
a
second
reason,
i
would
urge
upon
you
for
rejecting
the
system
and
guilt-related
distinction
as
the
basis
for
waiver
is
that
as
you
look
at
the
things
that
are
normally
not
waived
by
a
guilty
plea
such
things
as
mental
incompetence,
coercion,
ineffective
assistance,
failure
to
plea,
you
see
that
while
they
are,
in
some
sense,
system-related
they
also
have
a
common
factor
which
isn?t
present
in
this
case.
and
i
think
that
common
factor
is
that
in
none
of
those
cases
is
a
plea,
a
reliable
indicator
that
there
may
be
a
valid
basis
for
it.
certainly
in
perry?s
case,
if
we
are
just
to
throw
aside
his
accusations
or
his
allegations,
pardon
me
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
your
honor,
i
don?t
agree
that
it
was
but
the
thrust
of
my
argument
would
be,
you
wouldn?t
have
to
reach
that
because
it
would
be
waived
by
the
plea.
mr.
richard
n.
league
well,
i
understand
you
avoid
the
constitutional
question
if
possible
so
you
go
to
the
waiver.
mr.
richard
n.
league
well,
i
guess
so,
your
honor.
at
initial
outlook,
it
looked
less
of
a
constitutional
question
than
double
jeopardy.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
don?t
think
it
would
be,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
n.
league
that?s
true.
i
don?t
believe
in
it.
mr.
richard
n.
league
double
jeopardy,
according
to
judge
larkins,
is
the
raising
of
the
offense.
and
between
the
initial
trial
in
the
lower
court
and
the
subsequent
trial
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
that?s
why
he
claim
--
judge
larkins
held
it
was
double
jeopardy.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
don?t
know
that,
your
honor.
i
wouldn?t
have
thought
it
was
double
jeopardy
in
this
case.
though,
just
by
virtue
of
the
states
bringing
forth
the
higher
degree
of
the
crime
for
which
they
could
have
initially
tried
him,
at
least
in
terms
of
a
probable
cause
here,
at
the
first
level.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
say
there
was
not.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no,
sir.
he
automatically
got
a
trial
de
novo.
now,
the
normal
expectation
would
have
been
that
it
would?ve
been
on
the
misdemeanor
charge.
but,
in
the
interim,
the
solicitor
obtained
an
indictment
charging
the
higher
offense.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
two
additional
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
n.
league
one
was
inflicting
serious
injuries
and
the
other
intent
to
kill.
to
my
recollection,
they
weren?t.
mr.
richard
n.
league
the
same
event,
the
same
person,
the
same
acts.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
your
honor,
i
don?t
think
it?s
double
jeopardy
because
the
thing
is
no
real
risk
of
jeopardy
in
this
lower
system
unless
the
man
accepts
that
he
can
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes.
mr.
richard
n.
league
well,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
it?s
a
practical
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
your
honor,
there
was
no
felony
trial
but
we
don?t
have
the
record,
we
don?t
have
the
record
of
the
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
district
court.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
understand
he
did
from
his
allegations,
your
honor.
the
district
court
records
were
gone
when
we
filed
our
return
so
we?re
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
in
the
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir.
we
pled
guilty
at
the
trial
de
novo,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
that
much
i
know,
yes.
mr.
richard
n.
league
right.
mr.
richard
n.
league
he
received
a
trial
de
novo
at
which
he
pled
guilty.
no
evidence
was
put
on
this
time.
mr.
richard
n.
league
that
was
on
the
event.
mr.
richard
n.
league
that
was
on
the
event,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
n.
league
intent
and
serious
bodily
injury.
mr.
richard
n.
league
right.
the
proof
of
what
--
it
may
have
been
the
same
in
either
but
it
would
have
to
also
meet
the
requirements
to
sustain
those
two
elements.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
would
say
so.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
but
i
would
not
attach
perhaps
the
same
significance
to
it
as
your
honor.
this
well
could
have
been
an
event
where
they
tried
to
get
it
out
of
the
way
down
below
in
the
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
think,
your
honor,
under
state
law
at
least
it
would?ve
become
final
within
10
days.
it?s
only
voidable
at
the
instance
of
the
defendant.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
well,
i
think
because
of
the
greater
offense
and
lesser
offense
aspect
of
that.
mr.
richard
n.
league
in
the
state
law,
at
least,
your
honor,
if
you
tried
for
the
same
act
and
it
would
--
the
elements
of
the
offense
of
the
lesser
one
would
also
be
elements
of
the
offense
of
the
greater
one
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
then
you
couldn?t
retry.
mr.
richard
n.
league
even
though
that
were
the
case.
mr.
richard
n.
league
it
would
be
state
law.
it
well,
may
well
be
federal
also,
your
honor.
but
i
know
it
is
at
least,
state.
mr.
richard
n.
league
what
i?ve
just
said
about
the
lesser
included
offense?
mr.
richard
n.
league
well,
there?s
an
old
exception.
the
state
cases
state
v.
burke
which
mr.
keenan
brings
out.
mr.
richard
n.
league
sir?
mr.
richard
n.
league
it?s
in
his
brief.
yes,
sir.
as
an
early
?50s
case,
it
relies
i
don?t
know
whether
directly
or
the
interior
sites
within
rely
on
one
of
the
philippine
island
cases
decided
by
this
case
back
in
the
early
1900s.
now,
whether
or
not
that?s
still
a
viable
exception,
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
n.
league
and
that?s
what
i
would
i
say.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
that?s
what
i
understand.
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i?m
sorry
for
that,
your
honor.
my
voice
has
no
carriage.
i
knew
that.
returning
to
why
this
matter
should
or
should
not
be
waived,
i
would
just
say
that
in
reference
to
these
things
that
we
now
are
not
waived
there?s
no
dispute
about
whether
or
not
they?re
not
waived.
they
seem
to
have
at
least
one
common
factor
which
is
absent
from
this
case,
and
that
is
that
the
plea
is
not
a
reliable
indicator
that
a
valid
basis
for
it
exists.
here,
if
we
cutout
perry?s
allegations
that
he
pled
to
receive
a
totally
concurrent
sentences
with
his
expectation,
we
see
that
he
traded
an
argument
over
double
jeopardy
for
a
sentence
of
about
three-and-a
half
months.
so
i
think,
under
that
basis,
it
could
well
be
assumed
that
there
was
a
basis
for
the
plea
--
mr.
richard
n.
league
no,
sir.
i
don?t
think
pearce
is
applicable
to
this
case
by
virtue
of
really
what
was
said
in
the
colten
decision
that
the
possibility
for
vindictive
punishment
does
not
occur
sufficiently
within
the
two-tier
system
to
warrant
the
imposition
of
the
prophylactic
rule
in
pearce.
and
in
any
given
case,
your
honor,
you
could
view
the
case
but
that?s
not
the
incidence
of
it
to
warrant
the
placing
of
the
pearce
restrictions
on
this
type
of
situation.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir,
you
would.
mr.
richard
n.
league
in
the
former.
mr.
richard
n.
league
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
n.
league
i
think
you
don?t
get
it,
your
honor,
because
there?s
no
real
risk
of
punishment
inherent
in
the
double
jeopardy
system.
you
have
to
have
that
risk,
and
you
don?t
have
it
in
the
lower
district
court
so
long
as
the
plea
is
voidable
by
the
defendant
and
--
pardon
me,
the
verdict
is
voidable
by
the
defendant.
that
would
be
my
impression
of
the
case.
it
was
also
suggested,
i
believe,
that
a
basis
would
be,
from
judge
larkins?
standpoint,
was
that
the
reason
was
there
--
pardon
me,
the
right
was
fundamental.
i
don?t
think
much
need
to
be
said
about
that.
they?re
all
that
way
and
i
believe
this
court
rejected
that
idea
recently
in
the
school
taxation
cases.
it?s
true
that
if
sustained
this
plea
could
bar
the
prosecution
entirely,
but
that
would
be
the
case,
i
think,
with
any
given
constitutional
right
in
a
particular
case.
and
lastly,
the
retroactive
decision
idea
of
mr.
keenan,
i
had
thought,
would
not
aid
him
if
we
won
on
his
major
contention
it
wouldn?t
be
any
necessity
to
come
to
this
and,
if
he
did
not,
it
wouldn?t
help.
absent
any
questions,
i?ll
rest
there
and
thank
you
very
much
for
your
attention.
mr.
richard
n.
league
no,
your
honor.
thank
you.
