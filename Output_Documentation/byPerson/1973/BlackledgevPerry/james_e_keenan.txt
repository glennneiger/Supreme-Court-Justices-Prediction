mr.
james
e.
keenan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
on
behalf
of
respondent,
jimmy
seth
perry.
with
the
court?s
permission,
i
would
like
to
run
briefly
back
over
the
facts
because
though
they
are
a
little
bizarre,
i
nevertheless
think
that
what
happened
to
this
case
was
rather
clear.
on
august
1,
1969,
jimmy
perry
was
serving
a
five
to
seven-year
sentence
in
the
north
carolina
department
of
corrections
for
uttering
a
forged
instrument.
on
that
day,
a
fellow
inmate,
by
the
name
of
eugene
sawyer
received
a
14-inch
cut
in
his
back.
an
investigation
sued
by
the
authorities
of
the
autumn
fire
unit
in
northampton
county,
north
carolina.
and
on
the
18th
day
of
august
1969,
a
warrant
was
sworn
out
by
a
prison
guard
charging
jimmy
seth
perry
with
the
misdemeanor
of
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon.
on
august
20,
1969,
mr.
perry
was
brought
to
court
in
the
northampton
county
district
court
which
is
the
proper
court
in
north
carolina
for
the
trial
of
misdemeanors.
all
misdemeanors
must
be
tried
in
the
first
instance
at
the
district
court
level.
on
that
date,
the
solicitor
or
the
district
attorney
who
was
trying
the
case,
after
conferring
with
the
officer,
felt
that
the
conduct
necessitated
a
charge
of
a
felony.
therefore,
he
made
a
motion
in
open
court
to
amend
the
warrant
to
charge
the
felony
of
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon
with
intent
to
kill
resulting
to
serious
bodily
injury.
under
north
carolina
law,
they
would
then
proceed
to
hold
a
preliminary
hearing
in
district
court
but
not
in
trial.
however,
later
that
same
day,
the
solicitor
learnt
that
he
victim,
mr.
sawyer,
would
refuse
to
testify
against
mr.
perry
and,
in
fact,
was
claiming
totally
lack
of
recall
as
to
what
happened.
therefore,
he
had
a
very
practical
problem.
he
did
have
a
statement
that
mr.
perry
had
made
to
the
officer
who
had
sworn
out
the
warrant
that,
yes,
he
had
cut
him
but
it
had
been
an
accident.
therefore,
the
solicitor
made
that
the
deliberate
choice
to
move
again
to
re-amend
the
warrant
to
charge
misdemeanor.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
sir,
it
had.
it
had
been
--
amended
the
charge
a
felony
and
the
record
of
the
warrant
shows
the
various
markings
on
it
that
was
first
misdemeanor,
then
a
felony,
then
a
misdemeanor
again.
he
proceeded
the
trial
in
district
court
on
a
plea
of
not
guilty
to
the
misdemeanor.
he
was
tried
before
the
court
alone
because,
under
north
carolina
law,
one
charge
with
a
misdemeanor
is
not
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
district
court.
he
then,
after
conviction
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
he
could
not
have
been
tried
for
a
felony
in
that
court.
that
court
could
have
conducted
a
preliminary
hearing
on
the
question
of
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
he
could
not
have
been.
he
then
appealed
to
the
northampton
county
superior
court
which
is
his
absolute
right
under
north
carolina
law.
upon
giving
a
notice
of
appeal,
the
solicitor
then
asked
the
judge
if
they
could
go
up
on
the
felony.
the
judge
said
?fine,?
and
found
probable
cause
on
a
felony
warrant
which,
at
that
point,
didn?t
even
exist.
the
state
then
took
an
indictment
to
the
northampton
county
grand
jury
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
this
is
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
this
was
after
mr.
perry
had
been
given
a
six-month
sentence.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
appealed.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
and
sentenced,
and
appealed.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
it
does,
and
it
entitles
him
to
a
trial
de
novo.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
in
the
superior
court.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
the
solicitor
then
inquired
with
the
judge
if
he
could
go
up
on
the
felony
charge.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
in
effect,
it
means
that
?since
he?s
appealed,
i?ve
decided
i
want
to
try
him
on
the
felony
rather
than
the
misdemeanor
the
second
time
around.?
mr.
james
e.
keenan
well,
i
would
contend
that
he
had
no
right
to
ask
anybody?s
permission
because
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
--
because
at
that
point,
he
was
bound
by
his
election
to
try
on
the
misdemeanor.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
because,
i
think
he
wanted
to
find
a
probable
cause
on
the
question
of
a
--
on
the
subject
of
a
felony
to
take
to
the
grand
jury
for
progression
by
the
grand
jury.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
pardon?
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
there
was
no
new
hearing
conducted.
the
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
it
was
a
farcical
proceeding
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
under
north
carolina
law
they
could
have
conducted
a
trial,
which
they
did
conduct
on
a
misdemeanor.
they
could
have
conducted
a
preliminary
hearing
on
a
felony.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
and
then
bound
him
over
to
the
grand
jury.
but
they
did
conduct
a
trial
on
misdemeanor
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
they
only
conducted
one
set
of
factual
here.
it?s
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
but
in
effect,
made
two
judgments.
the
first
judgment
was
to
give
him
a
six-month
sentence.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no
new
evidence
was
heard.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
the
judge
--
the
minutes
of
that
day
shows
that
the
judge,
on
his
trial
calendar,
did
enter
a
notation
of
a
six-month
sentence.
it
also
shows
that
on
the
official
minutes
he
entered
the
finding
of
a
probable
cause
after
a
plea
of
not
guilty
to
a
misdemeanor
and
a
finding
of
guilty.
under
north
carolina
procedure,
that
is
an
impossible
set
of
circumstances
where
he,
in
effect,
was
tried
on
a
misdemeanor,
pled
not
guilty,
found
guilty,
then
their
minutes
say
probable
cause
filed.
this
was
filed
over
to
the
grand
jury.
that
is
just
simply
not
a
possible
procedure
but
that
is,
in
fact,
what
the
minutes
show.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
it?s
not
required,
your
honor,
but
it
is
the
normal
procedure
that
a
person
charged
with
a
felony
in
the
first
instance
will
be
brought
in
the
district
court,
will
be
appointed
counsel
if
he
is
entitled
--
if
he
needs
counsel
or
is
entitled
to
counsel.
at
that
point,
a
preliminary
examination
will
be
conducted.
if
the
judge
finds
probable
cause,
it
would
be
filed
over
to
the
grand
jury.
the
solicitor
does
have
the
option
of
going
directly
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
the
original
petition,
the
pro
se
petition
of
mr.
perry,
basically
set
forth
the
facts
that
he
had
been
tried,
given
six
months
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
i?m
talking
about
his
petition
in
the
record.
i?m
not
talking
about
the
brief.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
the
appendix
just
contains
excerpts
from
the
petition.
i
believe
the
record
itself
shows
that
mr.
perry
pled
in
his
petition
that
he
had
been
tried
in
district
court.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
that?s
not
in
the
record.
that
has
been
gained
from
my
discussion
with
the
counsel
involved
in
the
case.
the
record
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
second-hand,
[laughter]
mr.
james
e.
keenan
the
record
does
show
that
mr.
perry
was
tried
on
a
misdemeanor,
given
a
six-month
sentence,
appealed,
and
then
indicted
on
a
felony.
the
state,
in
his
answer,
admitted
these
allegations.
so,
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing
conducted
in
the
district
court
on
these
allegations.
we
contend,
well,
just
to
finish
up
briefly,
after
the
matter
had
been
brought
over
to
the
grand
jury,
he
was
indicted
for
the
10-year
felony.
he
came
into
court.
he
had
a
disagreement
with
his
lawyer.
a
new
lawyer
was
appointed.
and
at
that
time,
a
plea
of
guilty
was
entered
as
charged
to
the
10-year
felony,
and
he
was
given
a
five
to
seven-year
sentence
concurrent
with
the
sentence
being
served
at
that
time
which,
as
the
district
court
found,
effectively
raised
his
sentence
by
one
year,
five
months
and
one
day
over
the
sentence
received
in
the
district
court.
now
our
basic
contention
is,
first,
that
the
act
of
the
state,
in
proceeding
to
charge
perry
in
attempt
to
try
him
with
a
felony
in
the
superior
court,
denied
perry
double
jeopardy
and
that,
therefore,
there
was
--
there
is
an
independent
constitutional
violation
to
be
showed.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
pardon?
mr.
james
e.
keenan
granted,
right.
we
contend
this
because
perry,
in
appealing
the
misdemeanor
conviction
we
allege,
did
not
waive
his
double
jeopardy
right
as
to
a
felony
charge
with
which
the
state
had
chosen
not
to
try
him
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
we
think
green
and
pryce
control
in
this
particular
instance.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that
is
correct,
but
we
think
what?s
important
is
that
the
state
had
the
full
opportunity
to
make
a
decision
whether
they
were
going
to
proceed
on
the
felony
or
the
misdemeanor.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
it?s
not
green
exactly
because
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
well,
wood
versus
ross
in
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
but
i
contend
that
the
rationale
of
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
green
and
rice
cannot
be
distinguished.
excuse
me,
green
and
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
right,
and
pryce
was
a
case
in
the
state
system
which,
i
think,
the
green
case
was
basically
applied.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
he
could
not
have
been
tried
for
the
felony
in
the
district
court.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
our
contention
is
that
the
state,
in
a
matter
like
this,
has
to
make
an
election.
they
are
not
free
through
a
series
of
successive
courts
to
keep
elevating
the
charge
up
simply
by
arguing
that
the
lower
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
they
could
not
because
there
is
only
one
incident
here.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
there
is
no
question
under
north
carolina
law
that
it
is
a
lesser
included
offense.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
absolutely
not.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
okay.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
they
could?ve
tried
him
on
the
felony
and
found
him
guilty
of
the
misdemeanor.
they
could
not,
in
effect,
have
two
successes
of
trials.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that?s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that?s
correct,
right.
but
we
contend
that
the
state
was
not
free,
having
made
their
election
in
the
first
instance,
to
then
reverse
course
and
attempt
to
try
him
with
the
felony
in
the
superior
court.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
right.
and,
the
major
point
i
would
make
is
that
we
would
contend
that
if
perry
had
not
appealed,
for
instance
he
had
been
given
the
six-month
sentence
in
the
district
court,
if
he
had
said
?fine,
that?s
a
justsentence
and
i?ll
take
my
punishment
and
go
off
to
jail,?
we
certainly
contend
at
that
point
the
state
would
not
have
been
free
to
turn
around
and
say
?well,
you?re
going
up
to
superior
court
in
this
felony
charge.?
mr.
james
e.
keenan
i
know
of
no
other
way
they
could?ve
re-tried
it.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
well,
north
carolina
has
basically
a
rule
of
practice,
but
i
would
also
pretend
it?s
a
constitutional
rule.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
but
i
mean
it?s
not
articulated
in
a
written
form.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
right.
because
of
the
felony,
they
could
try
it
for
that
in
the
first
instance
and
they?re
not
forced
to
effect
trial
for
the
lesser
included
offense
and
then
go
on
and
try
him
for
the
felony
later.
they
have
the
option
at
the
first
instance
of
proceeding
with
the
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
it
was
proceeding
with
the
felony.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
that?s
exactly
what
we
submit.
we
submit
that
when
the
sate
has
made
an
election,
they?re
bound
by
that
election.
that
they
are
not
free
then
to
proceed
and
try
to
elevate
the
charge
at
a
de
novo
proceeding
in
the
superior
court.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that?s
our
position.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
right,
and
we
contend
that
a
price
cannot
put
on
appeal
that
one
must
face
a
more
elevated
form
merely
for
exercising
the
right
to
get
that
appeal.
i
want
to
touch
on
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
right,
it?s
a
due
process
point
but
i
think
that
the
due
process
and
double
jeopardy
at
this
point
begins
to
merge.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
there?s
no
question
about
that.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
pardon?
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
in
the
trial
de
novo
in
the
misdemeanor?
mr.
james
e.
keenan
there
was
no
trial
de
novo.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
it
disappeared
in
to
the
felony
indictment.
that?s
what
happened
to
it.
he
was
never
brought
to
superior
court
on
the
misdemeanor.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
two
years.
under
north
carolina
law
virtue
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
he
got
five
to
seven
years
concurrent
with
the
sentence
being
served,
which
effectively
raised
the
sentence
by
one
year,
five
days
and,
one
month.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
right.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
well,
that
is
correct.
the
solicitor
sets
the
matter
down
for
trial
on
the
award
generally,
the
misdemeanor
award.
and
the
case
is
heard
all
over.
the
judgment
is
stricken,
in
effect,
and
the
defendant
is
given
a
jury
trial
in
this
instance
which
you
cannot
waive.
i
would
like
to
make
one
brief
point
regarding
the
jury
trial.
in
order
to
get
a
jury
trial
which
he
was
constitutionally
entitled
to,
because
the
matter
of
which
he
was
being
tried
carried
a
maximum
sentence
of
two
years,
he
had
to
first,
submit
to
a
non-jury
trial
in
district
court
because
there
is
no
provision
under
north
carolina
law
for
a
jury
trial
in
the
district
court.
we
contend
that
this
was
unconstitutional
and
that
it
deprived
him
of
a
right
of
a
jury
trial
for
two
reasons.
first,
this
court
in
ward
versus
village
of
monroeville
that
there
is
no
authority
for
the
proposition
that
a
constitutional
right
can
be
deferred
on
the
ground
that
it
is
available
at
a
subsequent
de
novo
proceeding.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
the
record
doesn?t
show
because
there
was
no
hearing
held
in
district
court.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
and
the
man
would
not
testify
at
the
second
trial
either.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
he
pled
guilty,
and
i?m
basing
it
on
conversations
with
him
and
his
attorney.
again,
there?s
been
no
evidentiary
hearing.
he
pled
guilty
because,
all
of
a
sudden,
on
this
charge
which
carried
a
maximum
sentence
of
two
years.
he
was
faced
with
a
10-yaer
felony
which
we
contend
he
could
not
even
constitutionally
be
placed
at
jeopardy
of.
and
was,
in
effect,
offered
a
deal.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
which
he
was
told
that
he
would
get
a
concurrent-type
sentence
if
he
pled
guilty.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
so,
in
effect,
he
ran.
if
i
can
come
back
to
the
jury
trial
issue
for
just
a
moment,
in
colten
this
court
held
that
a
sentence
on
trial
de
novo
could
be
increased
in
a
two-tier
court
system
such
as
that
held
in
north
california.
we
contend,
under
this
decision
and
under
the
decision
of
united
states
versus
jackson,
this
creates
a
dilemma
in
that
a
defendant
who
has
to
appeal
to
get
his
jury
trial
right
because
this
was
a
two-year
misdemeanor
has
to
run
the
risk
of
an
increased
punishment.
and
we
contend
this
is
precisely
what
the
court
said
in
jackson
cannot
be
the
case
with
the
exercise
of
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
he
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
he
was.
he
was
sentenced
to
six
months.
he
appealed.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that?s
correct,
but
he
was
placed
in
jeopardy
of
receiving
after
two
years
in
prison
in
the
district
court
without
his
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial.
that?s
our
point.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
he
was
charged
with
a
felony
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
he
was
charged
with
the
greater
included
offense
of
what
he
was
tried
in
the
district
court.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
it?s
--
i
don?t
think
there?s
any
question
but
it?s
a
greater
included
offense.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
they
include
two
additional
elements.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
which
did
not
have
to
prove
in
the
misdemeanor
trial,
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that
is
correct
also.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
well,
what
could?ve
happened
on
the
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
right,
although
it
was
concurrent.
nevertheless,
it
did
effectively
raise
by
a
year-and-a
half
the
sentence
received
in
the
district
court.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
it
does
not.
it
must
try
a
misdemeanor
in
the
first
instance
in
the
district
court.
the
statute
is
cited
in
my
brief
and,
on
that
score,
the
state
has
to
proceed
with
the
first
instance
to
a
district
court
on
a
misdemeanor.
on
a
felony,
it
can
proceed
directly
to
the
superior
court
or
it
could
proceed
to
the
district
court
for
preliminary
hearing
and
then
on
to
superior
court
for
trial.
a
misdemeanor
could
be
tried
twice:
first,
in
the
district
court
and,
secondly,
in
the
superior
court
de
novo.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
this
has
been
the
procedure
for
years.
i
really
can?t
give
you
the
date,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
pardon?
mr.
james
e.
keenan
i
would
think
so.
yes,
sir.
it?s
an
old
established
procedure
in
the
state
of
north
carolina.
of
course,
we?ve
got
a
problem
in
that
mr.
perry
pled
guilty
in
the
superior
court
to
the
felony.
and
i
realize
the
burden
to
distinguish
that
from
the
brady
trilogy
and
from
tollett
versus
henderson.
we
contend
that
there
are
several
tailing
distinctions.
in
the
first
place,
and
of
course
this
i?ll
state.
this
is
in
effect,
taking
as
granted
the
validity
of
the
double
jeopardy
argument
of
which
the
whole
argument
is
based.
the
first
argument
is
in
that
each
of
those
prior
cases
there
was
a
legitimate
state
interest
in
punishing
the
person
for
the
crime
to
which
the
guilty
plea
was
entered.
we
disagree
with
mr.
league
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
designed
just
to
protect
the
innocent.
i
think
it?s
clear
that
it
is
also
designed
to
protect
the
guilty
from
repeated
punishment
and
we
contend
that
the
state
had
no
legitimate
interest,
in
this
particular
instance,
in
punishing
jimmy
seth
perry
on
a
felony
of
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon
with
intent
to
kill
effecting
serious
bodily
injury.
they
lost
that
right
when
they
made
a
determination
to
proceed
with
a
misdemeanor
in
the
district
court.
secondly,
we
contend
that
on
the
issues
involved
in
the
other
cases,
there
was
a
situation
that
existed
where
if
the
infirmities
involved
were
corrected,
the
trial
could
proceed
and
punishment
could
be
imposed,
for
instance
in
the
case
of
tollett
versus
henderson,
illegally
constituted
grand
jury.
this
is
not
the
tollett
defendant.
he
is
free
to
go.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
in
that
particular
instance,
where
there
is
a
conscious
discussion
of
the
fact
that
the
issue
was
there
and
that
it
can
be
presented
or
not
presented
based
on
tactical
considerations.
i
think
that
it
could
probably
be
held
to
be
a
surrender
of
double
jeopardy
to
plead
guilty.
but,
what
i?m
saying
is
that
an
issue
such
as
double
jeopardy
that
factor
has
to
be
there.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
right,
that
is
correct.
but
what
we?re
alleging
is,
in
those
particular
instances
the
fact
that
the
person
pled
guilty
was
significant
because
of
the
fact
that
the
guilty
plea,
in
effect,
resolved
the
factual
matters
at
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
fact
that
jimmy
seth
perry
may
in
fact
have
been
guilty
of
a
felony,
we
contend,
is
just
totally
irrelevant
if
our
double
jeopardy
claim
is
valid.
the
fact
that
he
may
have,
in
fact,
committed
the
felony
would
not,
in
effect,
give
the
state
the
right
to
punish
him
for
the
felony.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that
is
correct.
i
would
not
have
pleaded
mr.
perry
guilty.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
i
am
in
this
instance,
speaking
outside
the
record
because
i?ve
had
frequent
discussions
with
the
attorney
recently
regarding
this.
at
the
time,
the
attorney
had
no
comprehension
that
such
an
issue
existed.
he
did
not
discuss
it
with
mr.
perry.
he
thought,
in
terms
of
the
fact,
that
it
was
trial
de
novo
and,
therefore,
the
state
was
free
to
do
what
they
pleased.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
i
don?t
think
so.
i
think
green
and
pryce
support
me.
i
don?t
think
the
double
jeopardy
question
is
that
hard
to
see.
i
think,
in
fact,
it?s
a
clear
double
jeopardy.
i
think
that
the
attorney
should
have
been
aware
of
the
fact
that
it
did
exist.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
i
think
a
person
has
a
right
to
waive
double
jeopardy
so
long
as
he
knows
he?s
waiving
it.
i
don?t
have
any
problem
with
that.
if
he
makes
an
intelligent
and
knowing
decision
that,
?yes,
it?s
in
my
best
interest
for
tactical
reasons
to,?
let?s
say
?plead
guilty
even
though
i
may
have
been
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
there
might
be
a
situation,
mr.
justice
brennan,
where
a
person,
let?s
say,
is
charged
with
10
felonies
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that?s
the
way
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that?s
what
i
believe
it
to
be.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
i
would
say
it
only
could
be
waived
--
only
in
the
first
instance
where
a
person
knows
in
fact
what
he?s
doing.
i
could
conceive
of
tactical
situations
where
it
might
be
waived.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
certainly.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
one
other
point
we
wish
to
make
is
that,
with
regards
to
double
jeopardy,
the
law
on
which
mr.
perry
primarily
was
basing
his
claim
in
the
district
court,
wood
versus
ross
a
fourth
circuit
decision,
postdated
the
entering
of
his
guilty
plea.
we
contend
that
the
fact
that
double
jeopardy
has
been
given
retroactive
effect
is
significant
on
this
particular
score.
i
realize,
in
prior
cases
this
court
has
held
that
when
a
guilty
plea
is
made,
it?s
not
set
aside
merely
because
later
developments
of
the
law
may
in
fact
give
a
person
a
valid
claim.
but
again,
we
would
go
back
to
our
position
that
in
these
particular
instances
the
state
had
a
legitimate
interest
in
punishing
the
person
for
the
charge
involved.
in
this
particular
instance,
there
is
no
legitimate
interest.
and
secondly,
to
perhaps
join
the
point
mr.
justice
brennan
just
briefly
made,
this
is
an
instance
where
if
the
person
knew
of
the
double
jeopardy
bar
particularly
in
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
there
would?ve
been
no
reason
in
the
world
to
waive
it.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
i?ll
grant
you,
i?ve
got
to
convince
this
court
there
was
a
double
jeopardy
violation
or
denial
of
a
right
to
a
jury
trial,
one
or
the
other.
i
can?t
prevail
there
was
no
constitutional
deprivation.
i?ll
concede
that.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
i
think
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
i
think
the
state
has
the
right
to
proceed
the
trial.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
it
does.
but,
the
state
does
--
if
the
double
jeopardy
issue
should
be
cited
against
the
state,
then
the
state?s
interest
is
forfeited
or
lost.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
right.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
the
state
does
have
an
interest.
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
guilty
plea
surrenders
or
forfeits
the
double
jeopardy
claim,
we
think,
in
the
question
of
double
jeopardy
which
we
do
see
as
an
absolute
bar
to
re-trial
brings
about
fact
that
the
state
must,
in
fact,
show
that
the
person
consciously
made
a
decision
to
surrender
the
right.
the
second
conceivable
situation
would
be
where
a
person
deliberately
bypassed
state
remedies.
again,
this
would
be
a
very,
very
rare
case
because
why
would
a
defendant
forfeit
a
possible
state
remedy?
the
other
question
that
was
brief
related
to
what
boykin
requires
that
a
defendant
be
warned
of.
if
the
rule
is
to
be
a
flat
rule
that
one
who
pleads
guilty
surrenders
any
prior
constitutional
right
with
no
qualifications
whatsoever,
we
would
contend
that
the
defendant
ought
to
be
told
that
at
the
time
he
pleads
guilty
so
that
here
could
be
no
question
in
his
mind
that
this
is
not
a
matter
that?s
going
to
be
resolved
through
later
writs
or
through
later
court
proceedings.
in
this
particular
instance
the
judge
did
run
through
a
series
formal
of
questions,
which
are
in
the
record,
with
the
defendant
and
which
indicated
that
he
was
warned
that
he
could
receive
a
certain
maximum
sentence,
and
that
he
did
have
a
right
to
trial
by
jury,
and
that
he
did
have
a
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel
and
so
forth.
however,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
and
in
effect
of
what?s
been
asked.
there?s
nothing
that
indicates
that
mr.
perry
was
informed.
if
you
plead
guilty
here,
don?t
ever
come
back
to
court
in
any
constitutional
claim.
and
we
contend
that
if
that
is
to
be
the
rule,
then
the
defendant
should
be
told
precisely
that.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
he
just
didn?t
reach
it,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
he
held
that
there
was
a
violation
of
double
jeopardy,
one,
and
secondly,
that
it
wasn?t
waived
by
the
plea
of
guilty.
thank
you.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
my
pleasure,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
appear
on
behalf
of
respondent,
jimmy
seth
perry.
with
the
court?s
permission,
i
would
like
to
run
briefly
back
over
the
facts
because
though
they
are
a
little
bizarre,
i
nevertheless
think
that
what
happened
to
this
case
was
rather
clear.
on
august
1,
1969,
jimmy
perry
was
serving
a
five
to
seven-year
sentence
in
the
north
carolina
department
of
corrections
for
uttering
a
forged
instrument.
on
that
day,
a
fellow
inmate,
by
the
name
of
eugene
sawyer
received
a
14-inch
cut
in
his
back.
an
investigation
sued
by
the
authorities
of
the
autumn
fire
unit
in
northampton
county,
north
carolina.
and
on
the
18th
day
of
august
1969,
a
warrant
was
sworn
out
by
a
prison
guard
charging
jimmy
seth
perry
with
the
misdemeanor
of
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon.
on
august
20,
1969,
mr.
perry
was
brought
to
court
in
the
northampton
county
district
court
which
is
the
proper
court
in
north
carolina
for
the
trial
of
misdemeanors.
all
misdemeanors
must
be
tried
in
the
first
instance
at
the
district
court
level.
on
that
date,
the
solicitor
or
the
district
attorney
who
was
trying
the
case,
after
conferring
with
the
officer,
felt
that
the
conduct
necessitated
a
charge
of
a
felony.
therefore,
he
made
a
motion
in
open
court
to
amend
the
warrant
to
charge
the
felony
of
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon
with
intent
to
kill
resulting
to
serious
bodily
injury.
under
north
carolina
law,
they
would
then
proceed
to
hold
a
preliminary
hearing
in
district
court
but
not
in
trial.
however,
later
that
same
day,
the
solicitor
learnt
that
he
victim,
mr.
sawyer,
would
refuse
to
testify
against
mr.
perry
and,
in
fact,
was
claiming
totally
lack
of
recall
as
to
what
happened.
therefore,
he
had
a
very
practical
problem.
he
did
have
a
statement
that
mr.
perry
had
made
to
the
officer
who
had
sworn
out
the
warrant
that,
yes,
he
had
cut
him
but
it
had
been
an
accident.
therefore,
the
solicitor
made
that
the
deliberate
choice
to
move
again
to
re-amend
the
warrant
to
charge
misdemeanor.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
sir,
it
had.
it
had
been
--
amended
the
charge
a
felony
and
the
record
of
the
warrant
shows
the
various
markings
on
it
that
was
first
misdemeanor,
then
a
felony,
then
a
misdemeanor
again.
he
proceeded
the
trial
in
district
court
on
a
plea
of
not
guilty
to
the
misdemeanor.
he
was
tried
before
the
court
alone
because,
under
north
carolina
law,
one
charge
with
a
misdemeanor
is
not
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
in
the
district
court.
he
then,
after
conviction
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
he
could
not
have
been
tried
for
a
felony
in
that
court.
that
court
could
have
conducted
a
preliminary
hearing
on
the
question
of
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
he
could
not
have
been.
he
then
appealed
to
the
northampton
county
superior
court
which
is
his
absolute
right
under
north
carolina
law.
upon
giving
a
notice
of
appeal,
the
solicitor
then
asked
the
judge
if
they
could
go
up
on
the
felony.
the
judge
said
?fine,?
and
found
probable
cause
on
a
felony
warrant
which,
at
that
point,
didn?t
even
exist.
the
state
then
took
an
indictment
to
the
northampton
county
grand
jury
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
this
is
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
this
was
after
mr.
perry
had
been
given
a
six-month
sentence.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
appealed.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
and
sentenced,
and
appealed.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
it
does,
and
it
entitles
him
to
a
trial
de
novo.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
in
the
superior
court.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
the
solicitor
then
inquired
with
the
judge
if
he
could
go
up
on
the
felony
charge.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
in
effect,
it
means
that
?since
he?s
appealed,
i?ve
decided
i
want
to
try
him
on
the
felony
rather
than
the
misdemeanor
the
second
time
around.?
mr.
james
e.
keenan
well,
i
would
contend
that
he
had
no
right
to
ask
anybody?s
permission
because
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
--
because
at
that
point,
he
was
bound
by
his
election
to
try
on
the
misdemeanor.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
because,
i
think
he
wanted
to
find
a
probable
cause
on
the
question
of
a
--
on
the
subject
of
a
felony
to
take
to
the
grand
jury
for
progression
by
the
grand
jury.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
pardon?
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
there
was
no
new
hearing
conducted.
the
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
it
was
a
farcical
proceeding
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
under
north
carolina
law
they
could
have
conducted
a
trial,
which
they
did
conduct
on
a
misdemeanor.
they
could
have
conducted
a
preliminary
hearing
on
a
felony.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
and
then
bound
him
over
to
the
grand
jury.
but
they
did
conduct
a
trial
on
misdemeanor
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
they
only
conducted
one
set
of
factual
here.
it?s
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
but
in
effect,
made
two
judgments.
the
first
judgment
was
to
give
him
a
six-month
sentence.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no
new
evidence
was
heard.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
the
judge
--
the
minutes
of
that
day
shows
that
the
judge,
on
his
trial
calendar,
did
enter
a
notation
of
a
six-month
sentence.
it
also
shows
that
on
the
official
minutes
he
entered
the
finding
of
a
probable
cause
after
a
plea
of
not
guilty
to
a
misdemeanor
and
a
finding
of
guilty.
under
north
carolina
procedure,
that
is
an
impossible
set
of
circumstances
where
he,
in
effect,
was
tried
on
a
misdemeanor,
pled
not
guilty,
found
guilty,
then
their
minutes
say
probable
cause
filed.
this
was
filed
over
to
the
grand
jury.
that
is
just
simply
not
a
possible
procedure
but
that
is,
in
fact,
what
the
minutes
show.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
it?s
not
required,
your
honor,
but
it
is
the
normal
procedure
that
a
person
charged
with
a
felony
in
the
first
instance
will
be
brought
in
the
district
court,
will
be
appointed
counsel
if
he
is
entitled
--
if
he
needs
counsel
or
is
entitled
to
counsel.
at
that
point,
a
preliminary
examination
will
be
conducted.
if
the
judge
finds
probable
cause,
it
would
be
filed
over
to
the
grand
jury.
the
solicitor
does
have
the
option
of
going
directly
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
the
original
petition,
the
pro
se
petition
of
mr.
perry,
basically
set
forth
the
facts
that
he
had
been
tried,
given
six
months
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
i?m
talking
about
his
petition
in
the
record.
i?m
not
talking
about
the
brief.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
the
appendix
just
contains
excerpts
from
the
petition.
i
believe
the
record
itself
shows
that
mr.
perry
pled
in
his
petition
that
he
had
been
tried
in
district
court.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
that?s
not
in
the
record.
that
has
been
gained
from
my
discussion
with
the
counsel
involved
in
the
case.
the
record
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
second-hand,
[laughter]
mr.
james
e.
keenan
the
record
does
show
that
mr.
perry
was
tried
on
a
misdemeanor,
given
a
six-month
sentence,
appealed,
and
then
indicted
on
a
felony.
the
state,
in
his
answer,
admitted
these
allegations.
so,
there
was
no
evidentiary
hearing
conducted
in
the
district
court
on
these
allegations.
we
contend,
well,
just
to
finish
up
briefly,
after
the
matter
had
been
brought
over
to
the
grand
jury,
he
was
indicted
for
the
10-year
felony.
he
came
into
court.
he
had
a
disagreement
with
his
lawyer.
a
new
lawyer
was
appointed.
and
at
that
time,
a
plea
of
guilty
was
entered
as
charged
to
the
10-year
felony,
and
he
was
given
a
five
to
seven-year
sentence
concurrent
with
the
sentence
being
served
at
that
time
which,
as
the
district
court
found,
effectively
raised
his
sentence
by
one
year,
five
months
and
one
day
over
the
sentence
received
in
the
district
court.
now
our
basic
contention
is,
first,
that
the
act
of
the
state,
in
proceeding
to
charge
perry
in
attempt
to
try
him
with
a
felony
in
the
superior
court,
denied
perry
double
jeopardy
and
that,
therefore,
there
was
--
there
is
an
independent
constitutional
violation
to
be
showed.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
pardon?
mr.
james
e.
keenan
granted,
right.
we
contend
this
because
perry,
in
appealing
the
misdemeanor
conviction
we
allege,
did
not
waive
his
double
jeopardy
right
as
to
a
felony
charge
with
which
the
state
had
chosen
not
to
try
him
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
we
think
green
and
pryce
control
in
this
particular
instance.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that
is
correct,
but
we
think
what?s
important
is
that
the
state
had
the
full
opportunity
to
make
a
decision
whether
they
were
going
to
proceed
on
the
felony
or
the
misdemeanor.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
it?s
not
green
exactly
because
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
well,
wood
versus
ross
in
the
fourth
circuit.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
but
i
contend
that
the
rationale
of
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
green
and
rice
cannot
be
distinguished.
excuse
me,
green
and
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
right,
and
pryce
was
a
case
in
the
state
system
which,
i
think,
the
green
case
was
basically
applied.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
he
could
not
have
been
tried
for
the
felony
in
the
district
court.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
our
contention
is
that
the
state,
in
a
matter
like
this,
has
to
make
an
election.
they
are
not
free
through
a
series
of
successive
courts
to
keep
elevating
the
charge
up
simply
by
arguing
that
the
lower
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
they
could
not
because
there
is
only
one
incident
here.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
there
is
no
question
under
north
carolina
law
that
it
is
a
lesser
included
offense.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
absolutely
not.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
okay.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
they
could?ve
tried
him
on
the
felony
and
found
him
guilty
of
the
misdemeanor.
they
could
not,
in
effect,
have
two
successes
of
trials.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that?s
correct.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that?s
correct,
right.
but
we
contend
that
the
state
was
not
free,
having
made
their
election
in
the
first
instance,
to
then
reverse
course
and
attempt
to
try
him
with
the
felony
in
the
superior
court.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
right.
and,
the
major
point
i
would
make
is
that
we
would
contend
that
if
perry
had
not
appealed,
for
instance
he
had
been
given
the
six-month
sentence
in
the
district
court,
if
he
had
said
?fine,
that?s
a
justsentence
and
i?ll
take
my
punishment
and
go
off
to
jail,?
we
certainly
contend
at
that
point
the
state
would
not
have
been
free
to
turn
around
and
say
?well,
you?re
going
up
to
superior
court
in
this
felony
charge.?
mr.
james
e.
keenan
i
know
of
no
other
way
they
could?ve
re-tried
it.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
well,
north
carolina
has
basically
a
rule
of
practice,
but
i
would
also
pretend
it?s
a
constitutional
rule.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
but
i
mean
it?s
not
articulated
in
a
written
form.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
right.
because
of
the
felony,
they
could
try
it
for
that
in
the
first
instance
and
they?re
not
forced
to
effect
trial
for
the
lesser
included
offense
and
then
go
on
and
try
him
for
the
felony
later.
they
have
the
option
at
the
first
instance
of
proceeding
with
the
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
it
was
proceeding
with
the
felony.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
that?s
exactly
what
we
submit.
we
submit
that
when
the
sate
has
made
an
election,
they?re
bound
by
that
election.
that
they
are
not
free
then
to
proceed
and
try
to
elevate
the
charge
at
a
de
novo
proceeding
in
the
superior
court.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that?s
our
position.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
right,
and
we
contend
that
a
price
cannot
put
on
appeal
that
one
must
face
a
more
elevated
form
merely
for
exercising
the
right
to
get
that
appeal.
i
want
to
touch
on
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
right,
it?s
a
due
process
point
but
i
think
that
the
due
process
and
double
jeopardy
at
this
point
begins
to
merge.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
there?s
no
question
about
that.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
pardon?
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
in
the
trial
de
novo
in
the
misdemeanor?
mr.
james
e.
keenan
there
was
no
trial
de
novo.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
it
disappeared
in
to
the
felony
indictment.
that?s
what
happened
to
it.
he
was
never
brought
to
superior
court
on
the
misdemeanor.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
two
years.
under
north
carolina
law
virtue
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
he
got
five
to
seven
years
concurrent
with
the
sentence
being
served,
which
effectively
raised
the
sentence
by
one
year,
five
days
and,
one
month.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
right.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
well,
that
is
correct.
the
solicitor
sets
the
matter
down
for
trial
on
the
award
generally,
the
misdemeanor
award.
and
the
case
is
heard
all
over.
the
judgment
is
stricken,
in
effect,
and
the
defendant
is
given
a
jury
trial
in
this
instance
which
you
cannot
waive.
i
would
like
to
make
one
brief
point
regarding
the
jury
trial.
in
order
to
get
a
jury
trial
which
he
was
constitutionally
entitled
to,
because
the
matter
of
which
he
was
being
tried
carried
a
maximum
sentence
of
two
years,
he
had
to
first,
submit
to
a
non-jury
trial
in
district
court
because
there
is
no
provision
under
north
carolina
law
for
a
jury
trial
in
the
district
court.
we
contend
that
this
was
unconstitutional
and
that
it
deprived
him
of
a
right
of
a
jury
trial
for
two
reasons.
first,
this
court
in
ward
versus
village
of
monroeville
that
there
is
no
authority
for
the
proposition
that
a
constitutional
right
can
be
deferred
on
the
ground
that
it
is
available
at
a
subsequent
de
novo
proceeding.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
the
record
doesn?t
show
because
there
was
no
hearing
held
in
district
court.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
and
the
man
would
not
testify
at
the
second
trial
either.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
he
pled
guilty,
and
i?m
basing
it
on
conversations
with
him
and
his
attorney.
again,
there?s
been
no
evidentiary
hearing.
he
pled
guilty
because,
all
of
a
sudden,
on
this
charge
which
carried
a
maximum
sentence
of
two
years.
he
was
faced
with
a
10-yaer
felony
which
we
contend
he
could
not
even
constitutionally
be
placed
at
jeopardy
of.
and
was,
in
effect,
offered
a
deal.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
which
he
was
told
that
he
would
get
a
concurrent-type
sentence
if
he
pled
guilty.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
so,
in
effect,
he
ran.
if
i
can
come
back
to
the
jury
trial
issue
for
just
a
moment,
in
colten
this
court
held
that
a
sentence
on
trial
de
novo
could
be
increased
in
a
two-tier
court
system
such
as
that
held
in
north
california.
we
contend,
under
this
decision
and
under
the
decision
of
united
states
versus
jackson,
this
creates
a
dilemma
in
that
a
defendant
who
has
to
appeal
to
get
his
jury
trial
right
because
this
was
a
two-year
misdemeanor
has
to
run
the
risk
of
an
increased
punishment.
and
we
contend
this
is
precisely
what
the
court
said
in
jackson
cannot
be
the
case
with
the
exercise
of
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
he
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
he
was.
he
was
sentenced
to
six
months.
he
appealed.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that?s
correct,
but
he
was
placed
in
jeopardy
of
receiving
after
two
years
in
prison
in
the
district
court
without
his
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial.
that?s
our
point.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
he
was
charged
with
a
felony
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
he
was
charged
with
the
greater
included
offense
of
what
he
was
tried
in
the
district
court.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
it?s
--
i
don?t
think
there?s
any
question
but
it?s
a
greater
included
offense.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
they
include
two
additional
elements.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
which
did
not
have
to
prove
in
the
misdemeanor
trial,
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that
is
correct
also.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
well,
what
could?ve
happened
on
the
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
right,
although
it
was
concurrent.
nevertheless,
it
did
effectively
raise
by
a
year-and-a
half
the
sentence
received
in
the
district
court.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
no,
it
does
not.
it
must
try
a
misdemeanor
in
the
first
instance
in
the
district
court.
the
statute
is
cited
in
my
brief
and,
on
that
score,
the
state
has
to
proceed
with
the
first
instance
to
a
district
court
on
a
misdemeanor.
on
a
felony,
it
can
proceed
directly
to
the
superior
court
or
it
could
proceed
to
the
district
court
for
preliminary
hearing
and
then
on
to
superior
court
for
trial.
a
misdemeanor
could
be
tried
twice:
first,
in
the
district
court
and,
secondly,
in
the
superior
court
de
novo.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
this
has
been
the
procedure
for
years.
i
really
can?t
give
you
the
date,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
pardon?
mr.
james
e.
keenan
i
would
think
so.
yes,
sir.
it?s
an
old
established
procedure
in
the
state
of
north
carolina.
of
course,
we?ve
got
a
problem
in
that
mr.
perry
pled
guilty
in
the
superior
court
to
the
felony.
and
i
realize
the
burden
to
distinguish
that
from
the
brady
trilogy
and
from
tollett
versus
henderson.
we
contend
that
there
are
several
tailing
distinctions.
in
the
first
place,
and
of
course
this
i?ll
state.
this
is
in
effect,
taking
as
granted
the
validity
of
the
double
jeopardy
argument
of
which
the
whole
argument
is
based.
the
first
argument
is
in
that
each
of
those
prior
cases
there
was
a
legitimate
state
interest
in
punishing
the
person
for
the
crime
to
which
the
guilty
plea
was
entered.
we
disagree
with
mr.
league
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
designed
just
to
protect
the
innocent.
i
think
it?s
clear
that
it
is
also
designed
to
protect
the
guilty
from
repeated
punishment
and
we
contend
that
the
state
had
no
legitimate
interest,
in
this
particular
instance,
in
punishing
jimmy
seth
perry
on
a
felony
of
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon
with
intent
to
kill
effecting
serious
bodily
injury.
they
lost
that
right
when
they
made
a
determination
to
proceed
with
a
misdemeanor
in
the
district
court.
secondly,
we
contend
that
on
the
issues
involved
in
the
other
cases,
there
was
a
situation
that
existed
where
if
the
infirmities
involved
were
corrected,
the
trial
could
proceed
and
punishment
could
be
imposed,
for
instance
in
the
case
of
tollett
versus
henderson,
illegally
constituted
grand
jury.
this
is
not
the
tollett
defendant.
he
is
free
to
go.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
in
that
particular
instance,
where
there
is
a
conscious
discussion
of
the
fact
that
the
issue
was
there
and
that
it
can
be
presented
or
not
presented
based
on
tactical
considerations.
i
think
that
it
could
probably
be
held
to
be
a
surrender
of
double
jeopardy
to
plead
guilty.
but,
what
i?m
saying
is
that
an
issue
such
as
double
jeopardy
that
factor
has
to
be
there.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
right,
that
is
correct.
but
what
we?re
alleging
is,
in
those
particular
instances
the
fact
that
the
person
pled
guilty
was
significant
because
of
the
fact
that
the
guilty
plea,
in
effect,
resolved
the
factual
matters
at
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
fact
that
jimmy
seth
perry
may
in
fact
have
been
guilty
of
a
felony,
we
contend,
is
just
totally
irrelevant
if
our
double
jeopardy
claim
is
valid.
the
fact
that
he
may
have,
in
fact,
committed
the
felony
would
not,
in
effect,
give
the
state
the
right
to
punish
him
for
the
felony.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that
is
correct.
i
would
not
have
pleaded
mr.
perry
guilty.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
i
am
in
this
instance,
speaking
outside
the
record
because
i?ve
had
frequent
discussions
with
the
attorney
recently
regarding
this.
at
the
time,
the
attorney
had
no
comprehension
that
such
an
issue
existed.
he
did
not
discuss
it
with
mr.
perry.
he
thought,
in
terms
of
the
fact,
that
it
was
trial
de
novo
and,
therefore,
the
state
was
free
to
do
what
they
pleased.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
i
don?t
think
so.
i
think
green
and
pryce
support
me.
i
don?t
think
the
double
jeopardy
question
is
that
hard
to
see.
i
think,
in
fact,
it?s
a
clear
double
jeopardy.
i
think
that
the
attorney
should
have
been
aware
of
the
fact
that
it
did
exist.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
i
think
a
person
has
a
right
to
waive
double
jeopardy
so
long
as
he
knows
he?s
waiving
it.
i
don?t
have
any
problem
with
that.
if
he
makes
an
intelligent
and
knowing
decision
that,
?yes,
it?s
in
my
best
interest
for
tactical
reasons
to,?
let?s
say
?plead
guilty
even
though
i
may
have
been
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
there
might
be
a
situation,
mr.
justice
brennan,
where
a
person,
let?s
say,
is
charged
with
10
felonies
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that?s
the
way
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
that?s
what
i
believe
it
to
be.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
i
would
say
it
only
could
be
waived
--
only
in
the
first
instance
where
a
person
knows
in
fact
what
he?s
doing.
i
could
conceive
of
tactical
situations
where
it
might
be
waived.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
certainly.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
one
other
point
we
wish
to
make
is
that,
with
regards
to
double
jeopardy,
the
law
on
which
mr.
perry
primarily
was
basing
his
claim
in
the
district
court,
wood
versus
ross
a
fourth
circuit
decision,
postdated
the
entering
of
his
guilty
plea.
we
contend
that
the
fact
that
double
jeopardy
has
been
given
retroactive
effect
is
significant
on
this
particular
score.
i
realize,
in
prior
cases
this
court
has
held
that
when
a
guilty
plea
is
made,
it?s
not
set
aside
merely
because
later
developments
of
the
law
may
in
fact
give
a
person
a
valid
claim.
but
again,
we
would
go
back
to
our
position
that
in
these
particular
instances
the
state
had
a
legitimate
interest
in
punishing
the
person
for
the
charge
involved.
in
this
particular
instance,
there
is
no
legitimate
interest.
and
secondly,
to
perhaps
join
the
point
mr.
justice
brennan
just
briefly
made,
this
is
an
instance
where
if
the
person
knew
of
the
double
jeopardy
bar
particularly
in
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
there
would?ve
been
no
reason
in
the
world
to
waive
it.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
i?ll
grant
you,
i?ve
got
to
convince
this
court
there
was
a
double
jeopardy
violation
or
denial
of
a
right
to
a
jury
trial,
one
or
the
other.
i
can?t
prevail
there
was
no
constitutional
deprivation.
i?ll
concede
that.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
i
think
--
mr.
james
e.
keenan
i
think
the
state
has
the
right
to
proceed
the
trial.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
it
does.
but,
the
state
does
--
if
the
double
jeopardy
issue
should
be
cited
against
the
state,
then
the
state?s
interest
is
forfeited
or
lost.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
right.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
the
state
does
have
an
interest.
but
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
guilty
plea
surrenders
or
forfeits
the
double
jeopardy
claim,
we
think,
in
the
question
of
double
jeopardy
which
we
do
see
as
an
absolute
bar
to
re-trial
brings
about
fact
that
the
state
must,
in
fact,
show
that
the
person
consciously
made
a
decision
to
surrender
the
right.
the
second
conceivable
situation
would
be
where
a
person
deliberately
bypassed
state
remedies.
again,
this
would
be
a
very,
very
rare
case
because
why
would
a
defendant
forfeit
a
possible
state
remedy?
the
other
question
that
was
brief
related
to
what
boykin
requires
that
a
defendant
be
warned
of.
if
the
rule
is
to
be
a
flat
rule
that
one
who
pleads
guilty
surrenders
any
prior
constitutional
right
with
no
qualifications
whatsoever,
we
would
contend
that
the
defendant
ought
to
be
told
that
at
the
time
he
pleads
guilty
so
that
here
could
be
no
question
in
his
mind
that
this
is
not
a
matter
that?s
going
to
be
resolved
through
later
writs
or
through
later
court
proceedings.
in
this
particular
instance
the
judge
did
run
through
a
series
formal
of
questions,
which
are
in
the
record,
with
the
defendant
and
which
indicated
that
he
was
warned
that
he
could
receive
a
certain
maximum
sentence,
and
that
he
did
have
a
right
to
trial
by
jury,
and
that
he
did
have
a
right
to
be
represented
by
counsel
and
so
forth.
however,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
indicates
and
in
effect
of
what?s
been
asked.
there?s
nothing
that
indicates
that
mr.
perry
was
informed.
if
you
plead
guilty
here,
don?t
ever
come
back
to
court
in
any
constitutional
claim.
and
we
contend
that
if
that
is
to
be
the
rule,
then
the
defendant
should
be
told
precisely
that.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
he
just
didn?t
reach
it,
mr.
justice
rehnquist.
he
held
that
there
was
a
violation
of
double
jeopardy,
one,
and
secondly,
that
it
wasn?t
waived
by
the
plea
of
guilty.
thank
you.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
yes,
sir.
mr.
james
e.
keenan
my
pleasure,
sir.
