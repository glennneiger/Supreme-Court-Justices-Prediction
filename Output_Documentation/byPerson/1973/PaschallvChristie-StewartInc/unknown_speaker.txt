unknown
speaker
mr.
legg,
i
take
it,
you’re
making
no
challenge
to
the
original
sale
here.
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
now
that
i
have
you
interrupted
is
why
is
there
a
difference
between
the
two
statutes?
one
calls
for
three
weeks
public's
notice,
the
other
one
for
four
weeks
public's
notice.
makes
no
difference
i
suppose
--
unknown
speaker
and
in
the
resale,
you
must
name
owner?
unknown
speaker
at
least
he
was
named
here.
unknown
speaker
of
the
surface.
unknown
speaker
well,
there’s
only
owner
who’s
taxed.
unknown
speaker
so,
that
means
the
surface,
doesn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
and
in
the
office
of
the
treasurer,
there’s
no
record
of
any
mineral
owners?
unknown
speaker
there
would
be
in
the
county
--
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
but,
next
door
in
the
county
clerk's
office
--
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
--
the
mineral
interest
is
recorded?
unknown
speaker
if
there
were
surface
owners
in
the
county?
unknown
speaker
that
factor
appeared
in
treasurer's
office.
unknown
speaker
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
your
client
were
a
lessee,
a
long
term
lessee
20
years?
unknown
speaker
even
though
there’s
no
record
of
the
lease
in
the
treasurer's
office?
and
probably
none
in
the
--
may
not
be
any
in
the
clerk’s
office?
unknown
speaker
recordable
but
not
--
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
against
subsequent
owners,
i
suppose?
unknown
speaker
so,
would
make
the
same
argument
as
against
lessees,
mortgagees?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
really
would
be
changing
the
practice
at
the
treasurer's
office
substantial?
unknown
speaker
if
you
prevail
here,
what
unsettling
effect,
if
any,
will
this
have
on
oklahoma
titles?
unknown
speaker
titles.
unknown
speaker
mr.
legg,
i
gather
that
while
there
maybe
separate
ownership
of
minerals
and
surface.
unknown
speaker
minerals
are
not
separately
taxed,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
but
then,
what
we're
talking
about
here,
this
situation
or
not?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
as
i
understand
it,
nonpayment
of
taxes
by
the
surface
owner
results
in
the
sale
not
only
the
surface
rights
but
also
the
mineral
rights.
unknown
speaker
even
though
under
oklahoma
law,
the
mineral
interest
is
separately
recognized
under
the
law?
unknown
speaker
perhaps
in
respect
to
my
question
which
you
were
in
the
course
of
answering,
your
opponent
will
comment
on
it
when
he's
up,
as
to
the
unsettling
effect,
if
any,
upon
oklahoma
titles.
unknown
speaker
i
don’t
seem
that
is
an
answer
to
my
question
that
with
respect
to
mineral
rights
there
will
be
a
chaotic
result
in
oklahoma,
if
you
prevail
here.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if
you
have
--
the
only
time
the
question
of
starting
this
statute
limitation
comes
up
with
the
resale
tax
deed,
this
is
you
have
an
invalid
one
supposedly,
isn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
because
i
thought
the
law
was
that
the
resale
tax
deed
was
valid
against
the
mineral
interest
without
notice
at
all?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
notice
to
the
mineral
--
unknown
speaker
and
that,
even
if
it
was
tax
deed,
resale
tax
deed,
were
invalid
for
some
reason?
unknown
speaker
it
would
still
start
--
possession
of
the
surface
would
still
start
--
unknown
speaker
--
the
five
year
statute
running?
(voice
overlap)on
that
basis,
if
you
won
this
case
and
oklahoma
stuck
to
that
rule,
the
unsettling
effect
on
mineral
interest
will
just
be
five
years?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
said
if
oklahoma
stuck
to
that
rule.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
that's
--
unknown
speaker
yes,
so
this
case
won’t
affect
that
rule
that’s
already
the
rule
in
oklahoma.
unknown
speaker
would
you
refresh
recollection
as
to
how
the
county
would
have
been
able
as
a
practical
matter
to
give
notice
to
the
owners
of
the
mineral
rights,
no
taxes
are
assessed,
would
that
require
a
title
examination?
unknown
speaker
when
he
went
to
the
county
clerk’s
office,
would
he
have
to
go
the
through
land
books,
the
title
like
a
lawyer
would?
unknown
speaker
that
could
go
back
--
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that
i
was
just
curious
that
there
appears
to
be
no
provision
either
for
taxing
the
owners,
the
minerals
rights,
or
providing
some
readily
available
list
so
that
the
authorities
would
know
who
they
are.
unknown
speaker
in
my
state
they
tax
them.
unknown
speaker
i
just
said
in
virginia
they
tax
the
owners
of
minerals.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
mineral
owner
doesn’t
check
to
see
whether
the
surface
owner
had
paid
the
tax?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
you
have
the
same
reason
for
doing
it
that
a
mortgagee
has
to
do
it?
unknown
speaker
as
to
the
surface
owner?
unknown
speaker
in
the
oklahoma
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
name
of
the
case
that
so
held.
unknown
speaker
well
i
gather
is
it,
your
argument
then
that
any
due
process
requirements
are
satisfied
by
the
requirement
that
noted
to
get
a
perfect
title,
the
holder
of
this
certificate
must
give
notice
everyone
including
--
unknown
speaker
but
my
question,
your
answer
to
the
due
process
claim
is
that
due
process
is
satisfied
by
that
provision
of
your
law.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
again
that
personal
kind
of
notice
under
the
‘65
amendment
was
a
notice
only
to
the
surface
owner,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
county
clerk
too?
unknown
speaker
they
don’t
limit
it
to
the
county
auditor’s
record
then?
unknown
speaker
what
happens
with
the
producing
mineral
interest?
unknown
speaker
they
don’t
cover
producing
minerals
and
they
are
separately
owned?
the
only
difference
is
that
they
are
producing
and
they
are
taxed
separately.
unknown
speaker
and
the
fractional
interest
are
taxed
separately.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
who
pays
it?
well,
it
is
taken
out
by
the
oil
companies
at
the
time
before
they
ever
turned
the
money
over
to
the
roll
owner,
or
the
mineral
owner.
so,
that
on
producing
mineral
interest
the
treasurer
never
knows
who
owns
the
mineral
interest?
unknown
speaker
it’s
just
the
operator
–(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
what
case
is
that
you
are
reading
from?
unknown
speaker
is
that
cited
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
i
ask
again,
i
fail
to
find
lee
against
green
cited
in
your
brief
but
you
are
relying
on
it.(voice
overlap)
i
know
what
it
is,
it
is
cited
in
the
other
brief,
it
is
not
cited
in
yours.
unknown
speaker
at
least
it’s
not
in
your
index.
--
i
can’t
find
it
anywhere
in
the
text.
but
i
take
it
now,
you
are
relying
on
it?
unknown
speaker
one
other
question,
i
listened
to
your
description
of
checking
titles,
this
sounded
to
me
just
exactly
like
one
checks
titles
in
any
other
state.
unknown
speaker
but
i
wondered
about
the
significance
of
your
displaying
outline
in
this
detailed
method
of
checking
titles.
it
doesn’t
seem
to
be
particularly
honors
or
unusual.
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
the
oklahoma
law
puts
the
burden
on
the
private
purchasee
before
he
gets
the
perfect
title.
unknown
speaker
they’ll
give
everybody
notice
which
means
he
has
to
go
also
through
the
process
of
the
searching,
as
you
described
it,
but
that
the
oklahoma
law
does
not
put
that
burden
on
the
county
treasurer.
he’s
the
one
who
gets
the
title.
all
he
has
to
do
is
give
the
published
notice.
and
there
he
names
as
i
understand
it,
that’s
the
resale,
is
not
it?
he
names
only
the
surface
on
it.
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it
that
we
still
have
to
decide
whether
in
the
case
of
the
acquisition
on
resale
by
the
treasurer
gives
only
the
published
notice
you
have
described.
whether
that
satisfies
mullane
due
process,
don’t
we?
unknown
speaker
it
has.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
an
argument
that
the
issue
isn’t
even
here.
unknown
speaker
you
have
any
comment
on
my
question
to
your
opponent
about
the
unsettling
effect
of
a
reversal
here?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
a
problem,
is
it?
isn’t
that
a
state
law
of
questioning?
unknown
speaker
the
statute
of
imitation?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
there
was
a
finding
that
the
statute
of
limitations
has
barred
the
claim
anyway?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
rolston
you
didn’t
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm
as
i
read
your
motion,
rely
on
that
is
a
reason
that
we
ought
not
demote
this
appeal.
did
you?
unknown
speaker
you
apparently
relied
primarily
on
lee
and
green
as
i
read
your
motion.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do
argue
that
twice
before
we
have
refused
to
review
the
issue
now
presented
to
us.
unknown
speaker
both
in
cornelius,
as
i
gather
that
was
an
oklahoma
case,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
and
then
there
was
a
kansas
case
too?
unknown
speaker
robertson
and
levin.
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
that
finding
in
statute
of
limitations,
does
that
appear
in
your
appendix,
anywhere,
the
findings
of
the
trial
courts?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean
does
that
--
for
the
statute
of
limitations?
for
it,
or
just
the
fact
that
the
statutory
procedures
where
carried
out
here?
unknown
speaker
you
said
i’d
find
that
in
the
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
legg
can
we
go
back
to
this,
your
appeals
up
to
the
state
court
system,
you
did
not
appeal
from
this
finding
that
the
statute
of
limitations
barred
you?
unknown
speaker
that
is
to
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals,
you
did
not
bring
this
up.
unknown
speaker
but
what
did
you
win
on
mullane
that
under
state
law
you
were
barred
anyway?
by
the
statute
of
limitations,
i
mean
why
did
you
appeal
on
just
mullane,
it
would
not
do
you
any
good.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
if
you’re
right
on
the
constitutional
issue
then
the
statute
couldn’t
have
started
to
run
because
you
wouldn’t
have
had
to
put
notice
on
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
same
as
in
the
schroeder
case
as
i
remember
it.
unknown
speaker
schroeder
against
new
york.
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
claim
there
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
unknown
speaker
but
mrs.
schroeder
said,
“well,
i
couldn’t
run
cause
i
didn’t
have
the
notice.”
unknown
speaker
is
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
legg,
i
take
it,
you’re
making
no
challenge
to
the
original
sale
here.
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
now
that
i
have
you
interrupted
is
why
is
there
a
difference
between
the
two
statutes?
one

the
other
one
for
four

makes
no
difference
i
suppose
--
unknown
speaker
and
in
the
resale,
you
must
name
owner?
unknown
speaker
at
least
he
was
named
here.
unknown
speaker
of
the
surface.
unknown
speaker
well,
there’s
only
owner
who’s
taxed.
unknown
speaker
so,
that
means
the
surface,
doesn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
and
in

of

there’s

speaker
county
clerk
too?
unknown
speaker
they
don’t
limit
it
to
the
county
auditor’s
record
then?
unknown
speaker
what
happens
with
the
producing
mineral
interest?
unknown
speaker
they
don’t
cover
producing
minerals
and
they
are
separately
owned?
the
only
difference
is
that
they
are
producing
and
they
are
taxed
separately.
unknown
speaker
and
the
fractional
interest
are
taxed
separately.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
who
pays
it?
well,
it
is
taken
out
by
the
oil
companies
at
the
time
before
they
ever
turned
the
money
over
to
the
roll
owner,
or
the
mineral
owner.
so,
that
on
producing
mineral
interest
the
treasurer
never
knows
who
owns
the
mineral
interest?
unknown
speaker
it’s
just
the
operator
–(voice
overlap)
unknown
speaker
what
case
is
that
you
are
reading
from?
unknown
speaker
is
that
cited
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
i
ask
again,
i
fail
to
find
lee
against
green
cited
in
your
brief
but
you
are
relying
on
it.(voice
overlap)
i
know
what
it
is,
it
is
cited
in
the
other
brief,
it
is
not
cited
in
yours.
unknown
speaker
at
least
it’s
not
in
your
index.
--
i
can’t
find
it
anywhere
in
the
text.
but
i
take
it
now,
you
are
relying
on
it?
unknown
speaker
one
other
question,
i
listened
to
your
description
of
checking
titles,
this
sounded
to
me
just
exactly
like
one
checks
titles
in
any
other
state.
unknown
speaker
but
i
wondered
about
the
significance
of
your
displaying
outline
in
this
detailed
method
of
checking
titles.
it
doesn’t
seem
to
be
particularly
honors
or
unusual.
unknown
speaker
do
you
say
the
oklahoma
law
puts
the
burden
on
the
private
purchasee
before
he
gets
the
perfect
title.
unknown
speaker
they’ll
give
everybody
notice
which
means
he
has
to
go
also
through
the
process
of
the
searching,
as
you
described
it,
but
that
the
oklahoma
law
does
not
put
that
burden
on
the
county
treasurer.
he’s
the
one
who
gets
the
title.
all
he
has
to
do
is
give
the
published
notice.
and
there
he
names
as
i
understand
it,
that’s
the
resale,
is
not
it?
he
names
only
the
surface
on
it.
unknown
speaker
but
i
take
it
that
we
still
have
to
decide
whether
in
the
case
of
the
acquisition
on
resale
by
the
treasurer
gives
only
the
published
notice
you
have
described.
whether
that
satisfies
mullane
due
process,
don’t
we?
unknown
speaker
it
has.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
an
argument
that
the
issue
isn’t
even
here.
unknown
speaker
you
have
any
comment
on
my
question
to
your
opponent
about
the
unsettling
effect
of
a
reversal
here?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
a
problem,
is
it?
isn’t
that
a
state
law
of
questioning?
unknown
speaker
the
statute
of
imitation?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
there
was
a
finding
that
the
statute
of
limitations
has
barred
the
claim
anyway?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
rolston
you
didn’t
on
the
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm
as
i
read
your
motion,
rely
on
that
is
a
reason
that
we
ought
not
demote
this
appeal.
did
you?
unknown
speaker
you
apparently
relied
primarily
on
lee
and
green
as
i
read
your
motion.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do
argue
that
twice
before
we
have
refused
to
review
the
issue
now
presented
to
us.
unknown
speaker
both
in
cornelius,
as
i
gather
that
was
an
oklahoma
case,
wasn’t
it?
unknown
speaker
and
then
there
was
a
kansas
case
too?
unknown
speaker
robertson
and
levin.
unknown
speaker
incidentally,
that
finding
in
statute
of
limitations,
does
that
appear
in
your
appendix,
anywhere,
the
findings
of
the
trial
courts?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean
does
that
--
for
the
statute
of
limitations?
for
it,
or
just
the
fact
that
the
statutory
procedures
where
carried
out
here?
unknown
speaker
you
said
i’d
find
that
in
the
--
unknown
speaker
mr.
legg
can
we
go
back
to
this,
your
appeals
up
to
the
state
court
system,
you
did
not
appeal
from
this
finding
that
the
statute
of
limitations
barred
you?
unknown
speaker
that
is
to
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals,
you
did
not
bring
this
up.
unknown
speaker
but
what
did
you
win
on
mullane
that
under
state
law
you
were
barred
anyway?
by
the
statute
of
limitations,
i
mean
why
did
you
appeal
on
just
mullane,
it
would
not
do
you
any
good.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
if
you’re
right
on
the
constitutional
issue
then
the
statute
couldn’t
have
started
to
run
because
you
wouldn’t
have
had
to
put
notice
on
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
same
as
in
the
schroeder
case
as
i
remember
it.
unknown
speaker
schroeder
against
new
york.
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
claim
there
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
unknown
speaker
but
mrs.
schroeder
said,
“well,
i
couldn’t
run
cause
i
didn’t
have
the
notice.”
unknown
speaker
is
it?
