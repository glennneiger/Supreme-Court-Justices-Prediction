but
does
the

that?
justice

it
would
seem
sensible
wouldn’t
it,
if
you
say
that?
justice

it’d
be
sort
of
a

justice

well,
that
isn’t
what
this
says.
justice
byron

there’s
no
reference

been
different
entries
of

with
respective
different

different
tracts
of

well
in
then,
there
is
a
finding
then
in
the
trial
court
that
you
were
barred
by

anyway?
justice
byron

white
you’re
the
one
that
went
to
the
court
of
appeals?

you
didn’t
appeal
from
that
finding?

there
was
a

oklahoma
case
that
said,
in
resale
cases
the
possession
of
the

is
noticed?
justice

yes.
