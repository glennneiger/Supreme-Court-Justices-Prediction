mr.
william
j.
legg
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
an
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma,
and
it
deals
with
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
under
the
mullane
versus
central
hanover
bank
and
trust
company
and
subsequent
cases,
concerning
notice
requirements.
and
it
also
deals
with
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
under
interpretations
of
state
law
by
the
oklahoma
supreme
court.
mr.
william
j.
legg
i
raised
it
in
the
brief
to
this
court,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
case,
the
decision
in
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
worked
what
i
considered
an
equal
protection
situation,
as
compared
with
the
previous
case
by
the
oklahoma
supreme
court.
that
had
not
come
out
until
the
appeal.
mr.
william
j.
legg
i
believe
i
did.
mr.
william
j.
legg
it
may
have
been
the
basic
brief.
our
basic
point
has
been
all
along
the
notice
requirements
under
the
mullane
decision.
but
we
thought
the
equal
protection
argument
was
involved
also
when
the
decision
by
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
came
down.
the
facts
are
that
the
appellants
are
the
successors
in
interest
of
mineral
owners
under
40
acres
of
land
in
seminole
county
of
oklahoma.
these
mineral
owners
own
no
surface
rights
at
all.
it
was
strictly
severed
mineral
interest.
the
oklahoma
law
is
that
the
surface
owners
are
committed
to
pay
the
ad
valorem
taxes,
and
the
mineral
owners
have
no
responsibility
for
that.
in
1952,
the
surface
owner
failed
to
pay
the
ad
valorem
taxes
and
the
county
treasurer
put
the
land
on
the
publication
notice
for
the
original
sale
in
1953.
now,
in
oklahoma,
ad
valorem
tax
sales
are
an
administrative
process
by
the
county
officials.
it
starts
with
an
original
sale
when
the
surface
owner
fails
to
pay
the
taxes,
and
the
county
treasurer
must
place
the
land
on
that
original
sale
if
the
taxes
are
not
paid.
he
publishes
notice
for
the
original
sale,
and
in
the
publication
notice,
he
includes
only
the
description
of
the
land,
and
there
is
no
personal
service,
or
process,
or
any
mailing,
or
posting
on
the
land,
or
anything
about
nature
at
the
original
sale.
at
the
sale
there
are
two
ways
that
it
can
go,
if
there
is
a
bid
by
an
individual,
and
i'm
speaking
of
the
law
in
effect
in
1953.
if
there
is
a
bid
by
an
individual,
the
individual
receives
a
certificate
of
paid
taxes.
if
there
is
not
a
bid
by
an
individual
then
it
is
bid
off
to
the
county
treasurer,
and
he
receives
the
certificate.
mr.
william
j.
legg
it’s
a
lien.
it
constitutes
a
lien
on
the
land,
which
i
would
assume
would
be
a
property
interest
under
the
due
process
clause
and
the
later
decisions.
i
believe
there's
a
decision
that
holds
that
the
complete
title
does
not
have
to
be
held
to
have
due
process
rights.
then
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
well,
i'm
making
no
challenge
to
the
original
sale
except
that
it
forms
the
basis
of
the
entire
tax
sale
procedure.
and
one
of
my
key
points
is
that
if
there
had
been
notice
given
adequate
under
the
constitution
at
the
original
sale,
then
we
could
not
argue
that
there
was
no
notice
at
the
time
of
the
resale.
but
since
there
wasn’t
any
notice
of
the
original
sale
and
the
resale
in
our
argument,
then
we
feel
that
we
have
to
consider
the
original
sale.
mr.
william
j.
legg
i
don’t
know
the
reason
for
it,
it
is
there,
and
you
know
that.
mr.
william
j.
legg
in
the
resale
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
in
the
resale,
the
owner
must
be
named
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
well,
it
says
the
owner
as
appears
on
the
records
of
the
county
treasurer.
mr.
william
j.
legg
the
surface
owner.
mr.
william
j.
legg
that’s
what
it
was
after,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
legg
there
is
none
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
--
in
the
county
treasurer's
office.
mr.
william
j.
legg
there
is
none
in
the
county
treasurer's
office.
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
j.
legg
correct.
now,
on
that
point,
sometimes
the
records
of
the
county
treasurer
have
names
of
owners
of
the
mineral
interest,
but
not
in
relation
to
those
men.
in
other
words
if
they
owned
another
tract
in
that
county,
their
names
and
addresses
would
appear,
but
not
in
relation
to
that.
mr.
william
j.
legg
if
they
were
surface
owners,
yes.
mr.
william
j.
legg
it
would
appear
in
the
county
treasurer's
office,
yes
sir.
now,
in
the
resale
there
also
is
no
requirement
for
notice
to
the
mineral
owners
as
such.
there’s
no
requirement
for
service,
or
process,
or
posting
on
the
land,
or
mailing,
or
anything
of
this
nature.
so,
what
we
have
is
under
both
at
the
time
of
the
original
sale
and
also
at
the
time
of
the
resale,
we
have
nothing
but
publication
notice.
and
in
the
original
sale
there
is
no
naming,
there
is
just
the
description
of
the
land.
at
the
resale,
there
is
no
notice
by
naming
of
the
mineral
owner
as
such.
so,
at
the
time
of
the
1956
resale,
it's
our
position
that
our
people
had
no
constructive
notice
under
the
mullane
decisions
and
the
subsequent
decisions.
they
had
no
duty
to
pay
the
taxes
to
begin
with,
and
their
names
were
not
there,
except
over
in
the
county
clerk's
office.
now
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
i
would
assume
that
the
lessee
or
mortgagee
would
have
the
same
rights
under
the
mullane
decisions
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
in
the
clerk’s
office
it
would
be
a
recordable
document
if
it
were
a
long
term
lease.
mr.
william
j.
legg
it
would
be
recordable,
you
don’t
have
to
record
in
oklahoma,
i
mean
it’s
not
absolutely
necessary
to
record
in
oklahoma
for
the
validity
of
the
document,
in
any
event.
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
in
order
to
force
all
the
third
parties,
you
have
to
record
that.
mr.
william
j.
legg
i
believe
we
would
have
to
make
on
the
principle
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
this
would
change,
there’s
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
william
j.
legg
in
oklahoma
what?
mr.
william
j.
legg
well,
i
think
it
will
change
the
case
law
in
oklahoma.
it
will
probably
result
in
changing
the
statutory
law
of
oklahoma.
as
far
as
the
upsetting
of
titles,
i
believe
it
would
be
limited
to
a
five
year
period,
because
we
have
a
five
year
statute
of
limitations.
where
there
is
notice
to
the
owner
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
legg
they
are
not
separately
taxed
until
they
become
productive.
at
that
time
there’s
an
in
lieu
production
test.
mr.
william
j.
legg
this
is
a
nonproductive
situation.
mr.
william
j.
legg
that’s
the
construction
placed
upon
these
statutes
by
the
oklahoma
supreme
court.
now,
i
might
say
in
relation
to
production
that
the
land
has
subsequently
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
it's
a
separately
owned
property
interest,
yes,
sir.
i
would
like
to
say
that
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
well,
yes
back
to
that,
i
think
the
statute
limitations
is
the
barrier
to
a
full
disruption
of
all
titles
in
oklahoma.
i
think
the
schroeder
case
can
be
read
to
the
effect
that
the
statute
of
limitations
would
not
apply.
but
i
think
in
our
land
title
situation,
the
difference
is
that
the
party,
the
tax
sale
purchaser
goes
into
possession
of
the
surface.
now,
at
that
point,
he
sets
up
his
notice
even
though
there
hasn’t
been
notice
through
the
statutory
procedure,
he
sets
up
his
notice
by
physically
occupying
the
surface
of
the
land.
and
so,
the
five
years
statute
would
run
as
against
ownership
of
the
surface.
now,
as
far
as
the
mineral
rights
are
concerned,
it's
our
view
that
that
occupation
of
the
un-occupancy
of
the
surface
is
not
notice.
it’s
not
occupancy
of
the
mineral
rights,
until
there
is
actual
drilling
there,
because
there
is
nothing
to
put
anyone
on
notice,
or
to
put
a
severed
mineral
owner
on
notice
that
his
rights
are
being
claimed
by
someone
else.
as
a
surface
owner,
the
occupancy
of
the
surface
puts
that
person
on
notice,
so
that
if
you
don't
have
constitutional
notice
under
the
tax
sale
procedure,
going
into
possession
substitutes
that
as
notice,
as
far
as
the
surface
owners
is
concerned.
but
in
order
to
--
if
you
don't
have
constitutional
notice
during
that
tax
sale
to
the
mineral
owners,
and
then
someone
goes
into
possession
of
the
surface
without
going
into
possession
of
minerals,
there
is
nothing
to
put
the
mineral
owner
on
notice.
there’s
no
substitution
through
possession
that
puts
him
on
notice.
he
has
to
rely
on
someone
actually
drilling
a
hole
there
or
mining
or
whatever
it
is.
mr.
william
j.
legg
well,
if
there
has
been
an
attempt
to
explore,
there
will
not
be
chaos.
for
those
on
those
tracts
land
that
have
been
explored,
the
statute
limitations
will
start
running
and
there’ll
be
five
year
period.
for
those
of
mineral
interest
that
have
not
been
explored,
there’s
been
no
action
taken
to
take
the
mineral
rights
under
possession,
and
if
there
was
no
statutory
notice
given
or
constitutionally
effective,
then
their
position
would
be
the
same
as
it
always
has
been.
they
would
still
be
owned
by
the
former
owner.
mr.
william
j.
legg
well,
are
you
referring
to
the
40
years
statute
in
oklahoma?
mr.
william
j.
legg
oh,
yes.
well,
there
is
a
30
year
land
statute
in
oklahoma
but
it
doesn’t
apply
to
mineral
rights.
mr.
william
j.
legg
the
case
law
in
oklahoma
on
the
statute
of
limitations
is
that
the
possession
of
the
surface
is
not
possession
of
the
minerals,
except
in
the
case
of
the
resale
tax
deed,
not
in
the
case
of
a
certificate
tax
deed,
but
only
in
the
case
of
the
resale
tax
deed.
and
this
is
for
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
comes
in
to
my
argument.
mr.
william
j.
legg
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations,
except
in
the
case
of
a
resale
tax
deed
which
we
have
here
as
construed
by
the
oklahoma
supreme
court.
mr.
william
j.
legg
that
would
be
five
years.
mr.
william
j.
legg
no,
just
the
possession.
mr.
william
j.
legg
there
is
no
notice.
mr.
william
j.
legg
no,
you’d
have
to
drill
or
you'd
have
to
take
possession
of
the
mineral
rights
in
some
way,
yes.
and
this
is
a
statute
case
for
oklahoma.
mr.
william
j.
legg
not
under
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
no,
under
walker
versus
hoffman
which
was
a
certificate
tax
deed
case,
the
court
held,
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
held
that
possession
of
the
surface
is
not
possession
of
the
minerals.
mr.
william
j.
legg
and
consequently,
the
tax
deed
if
it's
invalid
in
this
inception
is
invalid.
but
their
is
language
in
that
same
case,
it
didn’t
deal
with
the
resale
situation
but
there’s
language
in
that
same
case
that
holds
to
the
affair,
or
says,
we
will
hold
that
if
it’s
a
resale,
then
it’s
a
completely
new
title
and
possession
of
the
surface
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
--
is
notice
to
that
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes.
mr.
william
j.
legg
according
to
that
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
that’s
true,
except
that,
i
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
if
it
did
but
this
gets
into
my
equal
protection
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
a
certificate
tax
deed.
mr.
william
j.
legg
the
possession
of
the
surface
is
not
possession
of
the
minerals.
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
but
that’s
decided
long
in
oklahoma.
that
was
the
walker
versus
hoffman
case
exactly
is
at
this
lady,
i
believe
it
was
a
lady
that
owned
the
mineral
rights
and
the
tax,
the
certificate
tax
deed
purchaser
claimed
the
mineral
rights.
mr.
william
j.
legg
that’s
already
the
rule
in
oklahoma.
mr.
william
j.
legg
that
will
require
if
the
mineral
owner's
name
and
address
is
not
in
the
county
treasurer's
office.
he
would
have
to
go
to
the
county
clerk’s
office
to
find
it.
now
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
he
would
have
to
go
through
the
indexes
of
the
land
records
to
find
out
who
claims,
if
any
or
outstanding.
mr.
william
j.
legg
it
could
go
back
to
statehood,
yes.
mr.
william
j.
legg
but
the
fact
is
that
the
mineral
interest
is
a
separately
owned
interest,
separately
owned
property
and
that
property
owner
has
received
no
notice
that
his
rights
are
in
jeopardy.
mr.
william
j.
legg
that
is
true.
mr.
william
j.
legg
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
in
a
numbers
of
states
they
do.
in
oklahoma
becomes
taxable
in
the
event
of
production.
mr.
william
j.
legg
well,
this
is
part
of
our
argument
justice
marshall.
we
have
no
duty
to
pay
taxes,
the
severed
mineral
interest.
mr.
william
j.
legg
under
the
state
law,
taxing
law
we
don’t.
mr.
william
j.
legg
but
it’s
a
separately
owned
property
interest
and
it
is
lost,
if
the
surface
owner
fails
to
pay
the
taxes.
mr.
william
j.
legg
i
believe
he
should,
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
since
he
has
no
duty,
it
would
be
an
ordinary
and
reasonable
assumption
on
his
part
that
his
surface
owner
is
paying
the
taxes
and
that’s
all
about
i
can
say
about
that,
because
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
there
is
no
presumption
in
oklahoma
that
i
know
of.
mr.
william
j.
legg
there’s
a
statutory
requirement
that
it
be
done.
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
the
oil
companies
do
that,
i
believe
justice
white
asked
about
that
too
that
the
oil
companies
and
the
mortgagees
regularly
check
for
payment.
but
it’s
the
individual
land
owner
that
is
not
ordinarily
going
to
check
on
that
kind
of
a
situation.
he
will
make
an
assumption
that
is
being
paid.
now
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
ordinarily,
i
would
assume
that
he
would
not
do
that.
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
there’s
the
same
liability,
yes,
sir.
but
if
there
were
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
(voice
overlap)but
the
mortgagee
is
dealing
with
wide
holdings,
a
lot
of
economic
interest
is
involved
and
he
is
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
(voice
overlap)but
i
was
referring
to
the
large
mortgagees
who
do
check.
i’m
familiar
with
their
procedures
and
also
oil
companies
do
check
to
make
sure
of
it.
mr.
william
j.
legg
well,
there’s
no
statutory
provision
for
that.
i
don’t
know
whether
it
would
be
valid
or
not
if
he
does
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes
and
the
county
treasurer
according
to
this
decision,
yes.
mr.
william
j.
legg
i
have
no
experience
on
that,
justice
white,
it’s
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
the
problem
with
it
would
be
that
if
there
were
statute
that
permitted
him
to
do
that
then
i
think
it
would
be
dependable,
but
if
he
did
it
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes.
it
would
be
and
there’s
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
have
attempted
to
have
instruments
recorded
even
in
the
county
clerk’s
office,
and
they
sometimes
refuse
that,
because
there
is
no
statutory
provision
for
receiving
that
kind
of
an
instrument.
i
think
if
i’ve
given
you
the
facts
and
the
statutory
law,
i
think
that’s
basically
my
case
with
the
questions
have
been
asked,
thank
you.
mr.
william
j.
legg
well,
in
answering
justice
white’s
question,
this
journal
entry
of
judgment
on
june
14th,
1965
did
what
mr.
rolston
said.
it
simply
determined
that
the
oil
company
owned
a
lease
on
these
40
acres
whichever
way
the
title
was
finally
decided
as
between
the
mineral
owners.
as
between
my
clients
and
his
clients
but
then
there
was
a
later
journal
entry
of
judgment
which
is
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
that
determines
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
there
is
a
finding
that
the
statute
of
limitations
run,
yes
sir.
but,
it
was
not
argued
in
the
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
no
decision
was
made,
and
it
was
not
argued
in
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
and
no
decision
was
made.
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
we
appealed.
mr.
william
j.
legg
no.
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
true.
may
i
make
three
explanations?
the
reason
for
the
four
year
gap
in
the
pursuit
of
this
case
that
the
mr.
rolston
noted
was
that
there
were
some
estates
pending
and
it
wasn’t
carried
forward
until
those
estates
were
closed.
then
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
oklahoma
is
the
least
is
an
example
of
the
least
strict
tax
foreclosure
procedure
in
the
united
states.
it’s
strictly
judicial,
i
mean
strictly
administrative,
it
has
no,
you
don’t
have
to
ever
go
in
to
court,
you
don’t
have
to
ever
give
any
notice
except
this
publication
service
and
there
are
11
states
in
that
category
according
to
my
research
and
there
are
14
states
however
that
have
fully
judicial
tax
lien
foreclosure
procedures,
where
you
have
to
bring
all
parties
into
court
and
foreclose
it
just
like
you
would
mortgage
it.
in
that
situation
there
would
have
to
be
a
process
issued
to
everyone.
and
so,
we
have
11
states
with
least
strict
14
states
with
more
strict
and
we
have
39
states,
either
more
strict
or
somewhere
in
the
middle
where
they
have,
even
though
they’re
using
an
administrative
procedure,
they
have
to
give
notice
either
formal
process,
or
mailing,
or
of
some
nature
that
goes
beyond
just
the
publication
in
this
case.
mr.
william
j.
legg
we
appealed
from
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
we
appealed
from
the
decision.
we
did
not
specify
that
particular--
it’s
my
recollection
that
there’s
nothing
in
our
appeal
documents
that
touches
on
that
but
i
wouldn’t
want
to
be
bound
by
that
statement.
there
maybe
something
that
we
appeal
from
the
total
decision
but
our
basis
of
appeal
--
our
strong
argument
was
on
the
basis
of
mullane,
and
that
was
from
the
very
first.
this
particular
point
was
not
contested
strongly,
it
may
have
been
touched
upon
but
it
wasn’t
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
we
felt
that
there
was
a
constitutional
issue
here
and
this
is
what
we
were
primarily
concerned
with.
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
that
is
one
argument
that
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
that
is
exactly
right,
the
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
the
schroeder
case
would
stand
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
no,
statute?
mr.
william
j.
legg
you
are
right.
mr.
william
j.
legg
in
oklahoma
decision,
yes.
mr.
william
j.
legg
there
is
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
there
is
dictum
on
that
point
in
the
walker
versus
hoffman.
mr.
william
j.
legg
that
was
1965
case.
mr.
william
j.
legg
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
is
an
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma,
and
it
deals
with
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
under
the
mullane
versus
central
hanover
bank
and
trust
company
and
subsequent
cases,
concerning
notice
requirements.
and
it
also
deals
with
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
under
interpretations
of
state
law
by
the
oklahoma
supreme
court.
mr.
william
j.
legg
i
raised
it
in
the
brief
to
this
court,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
case,
the
decision
in
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
worked
what
i
considered
an
equal
protection
situation,
as
compared
with
the
previous
case
by
the
oklahoma
supreme
court.
that
had
not
come
out
until
the
appeal.
mr.
william
j.
legg
i
believe
i
did.
mr.
william
j.
legg
it
may
have
been
the
basic
brief.
our
basic
point
has
been
all
along
the
notice
requirements
under
the
mullane
decision.
but
we
thought
the
equal
protection
argument
was
involved
also
when
the
decision
by
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
came
down.
the
facts
are
that
the
appellants
are
the
successors
in
interest
of
mineral
owners
under
40
acres
of
land
in
seminole
county
of
oklahoma.
these
mineral
owners
own
no
surface
rights
at
all.
it
was
strictly
severed
mineral
interest.
the
oklahoma
law
is
that
the
surface
owners
are
committed
to
pay
the
ad
valorem
taxes,
and
the
mineral
owners
have
no
responsibility
for
that.
in
1952,
the
surface
owner
failed
to
pay
the
ad
valorem
taxes
and
the
county
treasurer
put
the
land
on
the
publication
notice
for
the
original
sale
in
1953.
now,
in
oklahoma,
ad
valorem
tax
sales
are
an
administrative
process
by
the
county
officials.
it
starts
with
an
original
sale
when
the
surface
owner
fails
to
pay
the
taxes,
and
the
county
treasurer
must
place
the
land
on
that
original
sale
if
the
taxes
are
not
paid.
he
publishes
notice
for
the
original
sale,
and
in
the
publication
notice,
he
includes
only
the
description
of
the
land,
and
there
is
no
personal
service,
or
process,
or
any
mailing,
or
posting
on
the
land,
or
anything
about
nature
at
the
original
sale.
at
the
sale
there
are
two
ways
that
it
can
go,
if
there
is
a
bid
by
an
individual,
and
i'm
speaking
of
the
law
in
effect
in
1953.
if
there
is
a
bid
by
an
individual,
the
individual
receives
a
certificate
of
paid
taxes.
if
there
is
not
a
bid
by
an
individual
then
it
is
bid
off
to
the
county
treasurer,
and
he
receives
the
certificate.
mr.
william
j.
legg
it’s
a
lien.
it
constitutes
a
lien
on
the
land,
which
i
would
assume
would
be
a
property
interest
under
the
due
process
clause
and
the
later
decisions.
i
believe
there's
a
decision
that
holds
that
the
complete
title
does
not
have
to
be
held
to
have
due
process
rights.
then
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
well,
i'm
making
no
challenge
to
the
original
sale
except
that
it
forms
the
basis
of
the
entire
tax
sale
procedure.
and
one
of
my
key
points
is
that
if
there
had
been
notice
given
adequate
under
the
constitution
at
the
original
sale,
then
we
could
not
argue
that
there
was
no
notice
at
the
time
of
the
resale.
but
since
there
wasn’t
any
notice
of
the
original
sale
and
the
resale
in
our
argument,
then
we
feel
that
we
have
to
consider
the
original
sale.
mr.
william
j.
legg
i
don’t
know
the
reason
for
it,
it
is
there,
and
you
know
that.
mr.
william
j.
legg
in
the
resale
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
in
the
resale,
the
owner
must
be
named
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
well,
it
says
the
owner
as
appears
on
the
records
of
the
county
treasurer.
mr.
william
j.
legg
the
surface
owner.
mr.
william
j.
legg
that’s
what
it
was
after,
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
legg
there
is
none
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
--
in
the
county
treasurer's
office.
mr.
william
j.
legg
there
is
none
in
the
county
treasurer's
office.
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
that’s
correct.
mr.
william
j.
legg
correct.
now,
on
that
point,
sometimes
the
records
of
the
county
treasurer
have
names
of
owners
of
the
mineral
interest,
but
not
in
relation
to
those
men.
in
other
words
if
they
owned
another
tract
in
that
county,
their
names
and
addresses
would
appear,
but
not
in
relation
to
that.
mr.
william
j.
legg
if
they
were
surface
owners,
yes.
mr.
william
j.
legg
it
would
appear
in
the
county
treasurer's
office,
yes
sir.
now,
in
the
resale
there
also
is
no
requirement
for
notice
to
the
mineral
owners
as
such.
there’s
no
requirement
for
service,
or
process,
or
posting
on
the
land,
or
mailing,
or
anything
of
this
nature.
so,
what
we
have
is
under
both
at
the
time
of
the
original
sale
and
also
at
the
time
of
the
resale,
we
have
nothing
but
publication
notice.
and
in
the
original
sale
there
is
no
naming,
there
is
just
the
description
of
the
land.
at
the
resale,
there
is
no
notice
by
naming
of
the
mineral
owner
as
such.
so,
at
the
time
of
the
1956
resale,
it's
our
position
that
our
people
had
no
constructive
notice
under
the
mullane
decisions
and
the
subsequent
decisions.
they
had
no
duty
to
pay
the
taxes
to
begin
with,
and
their
names
were
not
there,
except
over
in
the
county
clerk's
office.
now
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
i
would
assume
that
the
lessee
or
mortgagee
would
have
the
same
rights
under
the
mullane
decisions
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
in
the
clerk’s
office
it
would
be
a
recordable
document
if
it
were
a
long
term
lease.
mr.
william
j.
legg
it
would
be
recordable,
you
don’t
have
to
record
in
oklahoma,
i
mean
it’s
not
absolutely
necessary
to
record
in
oklahoma
for
the
validity
of
the
document,
in
any
event.
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
in
order
to
force
all
the
third
parties,
you
have
to
record
that.
mr.
william
j.
legg
i
believe
we
would
have
to
make
on
the
principle
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
this
would
change,
there’s
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
william
j.
legg
in
oklahoma
what?
mr.
william
j.
legg
well,
i
think
it
will
change
the
case
law
in
oklahoma.
it
will
probably
result
in
changing
the
statutory
law
of
oklahoma.
as
far
as
the
upsetting
of
titles,
i
believe
it
would
be
limited
to
a
five
year
period,
because
we
have
a
five
year
statute
of
limitations.
where
there
is
notice
to
the
owner
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
j.
legg
they
are
not
separately
taxed
until
they
become
productive.
at
that
time
there’s
an
in
lieu
production
test.
mr.
william
j.
legg
this
is
a
nonproductive
situation.
mr.
william
j.
legg
that’s
the
construction
placed
upon
these
statutes
by
the
oklahoma
supreme
court.
now,
i
might
say
in
relation
to
production
that
the
land
has
subsequently
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
it's
a
separately
owned
property
interest,
yes,
sir.
i
would
like
to
say
that
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
well,
yes
back
to
that,
i
think
the
statute
limitations
is
the
barrier
to
a
full
disruption
of
all
titles
in
oklahoma.
i
think
the
schroeder
case
can
be
read
to
the
effect
that
the
statute
of
limitations
would
not
apply.
but
i
think
in
our
land
title
situation,
the
difference
is
that
the
party,
the
tax
sale
purchaser
goes
into
possession
of
the
surface.
now,
at
that
point,
he
sets
up
his
notice
even
though
there
hasn’t
been
notice
through
the
statutory
procedure,
he
sets
up
his
notice
by
physically
occupying
the
surface
of
the
land.
and
so,
the
five
years
statute
would
run
as
against
ownership
of
the
surface.
now,
as
far
as
the
mineral
rights
are
concerned,
it's
our
view
that
that
occupation
of
the
un-occupancy
of
the
surface
is
not
notice.
it’s
not
occupancy
of
the
mineral
rights,
until
there
is
actual
drilling
there,
because
there
is
nothing
to
put
anyone
on
notice,
or
to
put
a
severed
mineral
owner
on
notice
that
his
rights
are
being
claimed
by
someone
else.
as
a
surface
owner,
the
occupancy
of
the
surface
puts
that
person
on
notice,
so
that
if
you
don't
have
constitutional
notice
under
the
tax
sale
procedure,
going
into
possession
substitutes
that
as
notice,
as
far
as
the
surface
owners
is
concerned.
but
in
order
to
--
if
you
don't
have
constitutional
notice
during
that
tax
sale
to
the
mineral
owners,
and
then
someone
goes
into
possession
of
the
surface
without
going
into
possession
of
minerals,
there
is
nothing
to
put
the
mineral
owner
on
notice.
there’s
no
substitution
through
possession
that
puts
him
on
notice.
he
has
to
rely
on
someone
actually
drilling
a
hole
there
or
mining
or
whatever
it
is.
mr.
william
j.
legg
well,
if
there
has
been
an
attempt
to
explore,
there
will
not
be
chaos.
for
those
on
those
tracts
land
that
have
been
explored,
the
statute
limitations
will
start
running
and
there’ll
be
five
year
period.
for
those
of
mineral
interest
that
have
not
been
explored,
there’s
been
no
action
taken
to
take
the
mineral
rights
under
possession,
and
if
there
was
no
statutory
notice
given
or
constitutionally
effective,
then
their
position
would
be
the
same
as
it
always
has
been.
they
would
still
be
owned
by
the
former
owner.
mr.
william
j.
legg
well,
are
you
referring
to
the
40
years
statute
in
oklahoma?
mr.
william
j.
legg
oh,
yes.
well,
there
is
a
30
year
land
statute
in
oklahoma
but
it
doesn’t
apply
to
mineral
rights.
mr.
william
j.
legg
the
case
law
in
oklahoma
on
the
statute
of
limitations
is
that
the
possession
of
the
surface
is
not
possession
of
the
minerals,
except
in
the
case
of
the
resale
tax
deed,
not
in
the
case
of
a
certificate
tax
deed,
but
only
in
the
case
of
the
resale
tax
deed.
and
this
is
for
the
equal
protection
of
the
law
comes
in
to
my
argument.
mr.
william
j.
legg
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations,
except
in
the
case
of
a
resale
tax
deed
which
we
have
here
as
construed
by
the
oklahoma
supreme
court.
mr.
william
j.
legg
that
would
be
five
years.
mr.
william
j.
legg
no,
just
the
possession.
mr.
william
j.
legg
there
is
no
notice.
mr.
william
j.
legg
no,
you’d
have
to
drill
or
you'd
have
to
take
possession
of
the
mineral
rights
in
some
way,
yes.
and
this
is
a
statute
case
for
oklahoma.
mr.
william
j.
legg
not
under
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
no,
under
walker
versus
hoffman
which
was
a
certificate
tax
deed
case,
the
court
held,
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
held
that
possession
of
the
surface
is
not
possession
of
the
minerals.
mr.
william
j.
legg
and
consequently,
the
tax
deed
if
it's
invalid
in
this
inception
is
invalid.
but
their
is
language
in
that
same
case,
it
didn’t
deal
with
the
resale
situation
but
there’s
language
in
that
same
case
that
holds
to
the
affair,
or
says,
we
will
hold
that
if
it’s
a
resale,
then
it’s
a
completely
new
title
and
possession
of
the
surface
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
--
is
notice
to
that
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes.
mr.
william
j.
legg
according
to
that
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
that’s
true,
except
that,
i
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
if
it
did
but
this
gets
into
my
equal
protection
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
a
certificate
tax
deed.
mr.
william
j.
legg
the
possession
of
the
surface
is
not
possession
of
the
minerals.
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
but
that’s
decided
long
in
oklahoma.
that
was
the
walker
versus
hoffman
case
exactly
is
at
this
lady,
i
believe
it
was
a
lady
that
owned
the
mineral
rights
and
the
tax,
the
certificate
tax
deed
purchaser
claimed
the
mineral
rights.
mr.
william
j.
legg
that’s
already
the
rule
in
oklahoma.
mr.
william
j.
legg
that
will
require
if
the
mineral
owner's
name
and
address
is
not
in
the
county
treasurer's
office.
he
would
have
to
go
to
the
county
clerk’s
office
to
find
it.
now
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
he
would
have
to
go
through
the
indexes
of
the
land
records
to
find
out
who
claims,
if
any
or
outstanding.
mr.
william
j.
legg
it
could
go
back
to
statehood,
yes.
mr.
william
j.
legg
but
the
fact
is
that
the
mineral
interest
is
a
separately
owned
interest,
separately
owned
property
and
that
property
owner
has
received
no
notice
that
his
rights
are
in
jeopardy.
mr.
william
j.
legg
that
is
true.
mr.
william
j.
legg
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
in
a
numbers
of
states
they
do.
in
oklahoma
becomes
taxable
in
the
event
of
production.
mr.
william
j.
legg
well,
this
is
part
of
our
argument
justice
marshall.
we
have
no
duty
to
pay
taxes,
the
severed
mineral
interest.
mr.
william
j.
legg
under
the
state
law,
taxing
law
we
don’t.
mr.
william
j.
legg
but
it’s
a
separately
owned
property
interest
and
it
is
lost,
if
the
surface
owner
fails
to
pay
the
taxes.
mr.
william
j.
legg
i
believe
he
should,
yes,
sir.
i
think
that
since
he
has
no
duty,
it
would
be
an
ordinary
and
reasonable
assumption
on
his
part
that
his
surface
owner
is
paying
the
taxes
and
that’s
all
about
i
can
say
about
that,
because
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
there
is
no
presumption
in
oklahoma
that
i
know
of.
mr.
william
j.
legg
there’s
a
statutory
requirement
that
it
be
done.
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
the
oil
companies
do
that,
i
believe
justice
white
asked
about
that
too
that
the
oil
companies
and
the
mortgagees
regularly
check
for
payment.
but
it’s
the
individual
land
owner
that
is
not
ordinarily
going
to
check
on
that
kind
of
a
situation.
he
will
make
an
assumption
that
is
being
paid.
now
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
ordinarily,
i
would
assume
that
he
would
not
do
that.
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
there’s
the
same
liability,
yes,
sir.
but
if
there
were
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
(voice
overlap)but
the
mortgagee
is
dealing
with
wide
holdings,
a
lot
of
economic
interest
is
involved
and
he
is
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
(voice
overlap)but
i
was
referring
to
the
large
mortgagees
who
do
check.
i’m
familiar
with
their
procedures
and
also
oil
companies
do
check
to
make
sure
of
it.
mr.
william
j.
legg
well,
there’s
no
statutory
provision
for
that.
i
don’t
know
whether
it
would
be
valid
or
not
if
he
does
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes
and
the
county
treasurer
according
to
this
decision,
yes.
mr.
william
j.
legg
i
have
no
experience
on
that,
justice
white,
it’s
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
the
problem
with
it
would
be
that
if
there
were
statute
that
permitted
him
to
do
that
then
i
think
it
would
be
dependable,
but
if
he
did
it
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes.
it
would
be
and
there’s
--
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
have
attempted
to
have
instruments
recorded
even
in
the
county
clerk’s
office,
and
they
sometimes
refuse
that,
because
there
is
no
statutory
provision
for
receiving
that
kind
of
an
instrument.
i
think
if
i’ve
given
you
the
facts
and
the
statutory
law,
i
think
that’s
basically
my
case
with
the
questions
have
been
asked,
thank
you.
mr.
william
j.
legg
well,
in
answering
justice
white’s
question,
this
journal
entry
of
judgment
on
june
14th,
1965
did
what
mr.
rolston
said.
it
simply
determined
that
the
oil
company
owned
a
lease
on
these
40
acres
whichever
way
the
title
was
finally
decided
as
between
the
mineral
owners.
as
between
my
clients
and
his
clients
but
then
there
was
a
later
journal
entry
of
judgment
which
is
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
that
determines
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
there
is
a
finding
that
the
statute
of
limitations
run,
yes
sir.
but,
it
was
not
argued
in
the
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
no
decision
was
made,
and
it
was
not
argued
in
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
and
no
decision
was
made.
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
we
appealed.
mr.
william
j.
legg
no.
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
true.
may
i
make
three
explanations?
the
reason
for
the
four
year
gap
in
the
pursuit
of
this
case
that
the
mr.
rolston
noted
was
that
there
were
some
estates
pending
and
it
wasn’t
carried
forward
until
those
estates
were
closed.
then
i
would
also
like
to
point
out
that
oklahoma
is
the
least
is
an
example
of
the
least
strict
tax
foreclosure
procedure
in
the
united
states.
it’s
strictly
judicial,
i
mean
strictly
administrative,
it
has
no,
you
don’t
have
to
ever
go
in
to
court,
you
don’t
have
to
ever
give
any
notice
except
this
publication
service
and
there
are
11
states
in
that
category
according
to
my
research
and
there
are
14
states
however
that
have
fully
judicial
tax
lien
foreclosure
procedures,
where
you
have
to
bring
all
parties
into
court
and
foreclose
it
just
like
you
would
mortgage
it.
in
that
situation
there
would
have
to
be
a
process
issued
to
everyone.
and
so,
we
have
11
states
with
least
strict
14
states
with
more
strict
and
we
have
39
states,
either
more
strict
or
somewhere
in
the
middle
where
they
have,
even
though
they’re
using
an
administrative
procedure,
they
have
to
give
notice
either
formal
process,
or
mailing,
or
of
some
nature
that
goes
beyond
just
the
publication
in
this
case.
mr.
william
j.
legg
we
appealed
from
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
we
appealed
from
the
decision.
we
did
not
specify
that
particular--
it’s
my
recollection
that
there’s
nothing
in
our
appeal
documents
that
touches
on
that
but
i
wouldn’t
want
to
be
bound
by
that
statement.
there
maybe
something
that
we
appeal
from
the
total
decision
but
our
basis
of
appeal
--
our
strong
argument
was
on
the
basis
of
mullane,
and
that
was
from
the
very
first.
this
particular
point
was
not
contested
strongly,
it
may
have
been
touched
upon
but
it
wasn’t
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
we
felt
that
there
was
a
constitutional
issue
here
and
this
is
what
we
were
primarily
concerned
with.
mr.
william
j.
legg
yes,
that
is
one
argument
that
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
that
is
exactly
right,
the
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
the
schroeder
case
would
stand
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
no,
statute?
mr.
william
j.
legg
you
are
right.
mr.
william
j.
legg
in
oklahoma
decision,
yes.
mr.
william
j.
legg
there
is
--
mr.
william
j.
legg
there
is
dictum
on
that
point
in
the
walker
versus
hoffman.
mr.
william
j.
legg
that
was
1965
case.
