what
i’m
not
clear
on
is
what
right
does
the
state
have
to
extinguish
this
right
if
there’s
no
duty
to
pay
taxes?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don’t
owe
the
state
anything.

but
you
lose
your
property.
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
rolston,
what
is
the
interest
of
the
state
in
extinguishing
the
mineral
rights?
a
great
emphasis
on
the
deed
of
the
county
clerk
to
collect
every
nickel
of
taxes.
you
said
that.
well,
once
you’ve
collected
all
of
the
taxes,
what
is
the
interest
in
extinguishing
the
other
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
sounds
to
me,
like
you
threw
into
man’s
land
next
to
it,
while
you’re
at
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
rolston,
some
of
these
subsurface
deeds
are
files
right?
mineral
rights
deeds
are
filed,
aren’t
they?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
would
it
be
too
much
to
require
that
the
county
check
to
see
if
one
is
filed
and
noted
by
hand?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that’s
not
what
i
said.
i
said
that
one
man
files
a
deed.
would
it
be
too
much
to
notify
him
even
though
he
has
sold
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you’d
have
a
hundred
mineral
deeds
on
one
piece
of
problem?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
could
break
up
the
service
the
same
way.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
still
would
have
to
notify
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it’s
in
the
office
right
next
to
it,
it
could
be.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that
doesn’t
make
it
legal?
