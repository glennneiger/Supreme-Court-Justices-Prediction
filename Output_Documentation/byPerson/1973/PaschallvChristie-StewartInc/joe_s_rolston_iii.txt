mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
it
is
absolutely
imperative
that
the
chronological
order
of
facts
as
to
how
this
case
reached
this
court
to
be
spelled
out.
first,
we’re
dealing
with
40
acres
of
land
in
seminole
county
as
mr.
legg
has
indicated.
the
taxes
became
delinquent
for
four
years,
first
delinquency
occurred
in
‘52
and
subsequently
until
’55.
in
56
a
resale,
1956
a
resale
tax
deed
was
issued
in
may
to
the
appellees.
it
was
filed
of
record
on
june
the
6th,
1956,
and
it
covered
in
addition
to
the
40
acres
some
12
other
partial
to
real
estate.
thereafter,
in
1963,
the
appellees
executed
an
oil
and
gas
lease
to
christie-stewart
oil
company,
who
was
actually
the
party
plaintiff
when
this
litigation
first
arose.
during
the
period
from
1956
until
1965
when
the
lawsuit
was
filed,
the
trial
court
found
that
the
appellees
had
been
an
open,
notorious,
and
adverse,
and
in
continuous
possession
of
the
property.
and
one
of
the
elements
of
the
holding
of
the
trial
court
was
that
the
claims
of
the
appellants
was
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
suit
by
the
oil
company
was
filed
in
1965
in
order
to
perfect
their
lease,
because
their
attorneys
who
examined
the
title
of
course
realized
that
this
was
a
resale
tax
deed,
and
there
was
always
a
degree
of
uncertainty
about
its
validity.
the
appellants
then
filed
an
answer
in
the
cross-petitioner
and
brought
in
the
appellees
as
party’s
defendant.
the
appellees
then
filed
an
answer
to
the
cross--petitioner
which
they
specifically
raised
the
statute
of
limitation
that
the
appellants
were
barred.
the
first
issues
in
the
case
the
validity
of
the
oil
and
gas
lease
was
adjudicated
by
the
trial
court
in
1965.
and
then
for
some
reason,
unknown
to
my
self
since
i
was
not
personally
involved
in
the
original
trial,
the
issues
as
between
the
appellant
and
the
appellees
was
not
decided
until
1969.
during
that
period,
an
oil
well
was
drilled
upon
the
property
and
production
headed.
and
i’m
sure
that
keenly
increased
interest
of
all
parties
when
that
occurred.
i
think
it
is
also
absolutely
necessary
that
this
court
have
a
crystal
clear
understanding
of
the
statutory
procedure
on
tax
sales
in
oklahoma.
first
of
all,
the
statutes
hold
that
it
is
the
burden
of
the
taxpayer
to
come
forward
and
pay
his
tax.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
as
to
the
surface
owner,
yes,
your
honor,
to
come
forward
and
pay
the
tax.
mr.
legg
is
correct
and
that
non-producing
oil
and
gas
interest
are
not
subject
to
ad
valorem
on
tax.
they
are
deemed
included
in
the
surface.
only
when
production
first
arises
do
severed
mineral
bear
any
ad
valorem
tax,
and
that
is
in
lieu
of
tax
for
growth
production.
after
the
tax
has
become
delinquent,
there
is
a
certificate
sale
which
occurred.
at
that
time,
the
county
treasurer
runs
a
publication
saying
forth
illegal
description
of
the
property
in
amount
of
tax
due.
any
party
can
then
come
in
and
buy
a
certificate.
this
allows
the
party
to
have
a
lien
upon
land.
one
of
the
requirements
at
that
time
is
that
the
purchaser
must
pay
the
full
amount
of
the
tax.
so,
at
that
period,
the
county
treasurer
has
collected
this
tax.
he
has
performed
his
service
as
required
by
law
and
collected
100
cents
on
the
dollar
for
the
delinquent
taxes.
the
certificates
holder
then
is
required
to
hold
the
tax
certificate
for
at
least
two
years,
and
anytime
after
2
years
and
before
10
years
which
bars
the
certificate
by
statute
of
limitations,
he
may
apply
to
the
county
treasurer
for
a
tax
deed.
now
the
specific
statute
that
gives
the
tax
certificate
holder
that
right
provides
that
he
will
obtain
upon
receipt
of
the
tax
deed
from
the
county
treasurer,
a
perfect
title
provided
that
the
tax
certificate
holder
give
notice
to
all
of
the
owners
of
the
property.
not
owners
as
reflected
by
the
records
of
the
county
treasurer's
office,
but
all
of
the
owners.
now
there
in
lies
the
distinction
--
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that
that
is
correct.
and
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
has
by
numerous
cases
held
that
the
term
owner
as
used
in
that
statute
and
placing
that
burden
upon
the
tax
certificate
holder
includes,
mortgages,
it
includes
any
land
holder
it
includes
severed
mineral
interest
and
so
forth.
now,
mr.
legg
has
referred
to
some
confusion
between
the
supreme
court
and
of
oklahoma
and
the
case
involving
a
tax
certificate
deed
when
it
did
not
apply
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
distinction
in
that
case
is
that
it
was
a
certificate
deed,
and
it
was
stipulated
in
that
case
that
the
tax
certificate
holder
when
he
applied
for
the
tax
deed,
did
not
give
the
statutory
notice
to
the
then
mineral
owner.
and
the
court
said
that
one
of
the
conditions
precedent
to
you
acquiring
your
appropriate
title
is
that
you
fulfill
your
obligation,
my
statute
and
give
the
notice.
and
therefore
since
you
did
not
give
the
notice,
the
mineral
holder’s
interest
was
never
acquired
by
your
certificate
deed.
therefore
having
never
acquired
his
interest,
the
statute
of
limitations
would
not
run,
because
you
were
not
in
possession
of
his
interest,
having
not
acquired
it
in
the
deed.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
walker
versus
hoffman,
your
honor.
that’s
set
forth
in
our
brief.
now
if,
as
mr.
legg
has
indicated,
if
there
are
no
bidders
at
the
tax
sale
then
the
property
is
bid
in
by
the
county
treasurer
and
he
is
required
by
law
to
hold
the
taxes
for
two
years.
during
this
period
of
time,
anyone
having
any
interest
in
property
is
free
to
redeem.
the
supreme
court
has
also
held
that
a
non-producing
mineral
holder
may
redeem
taxes
at
anytime
and
there
by
obtains
a
lien
upon
the
interest
of
the
surface
owner,
and
may
enforce
that
lien
by
equitable
foreclosure.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that’s
correct,
and
i
don’t
think
mr.
legg
would
raise
any
issue
about
our
present
statute
and
tax
certificate.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
as
to
the
tax
certificate,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
because
it
does
require
notice
to
the
owner.
now
when
the
property
then
moves
on
to
the
county
treasurer,
and
the
county
treasurer
under
the
law
as
it
existed
at
the
time
this
deed
was
issued,
is
required
to
publish.
after
two
years,
no
redemption
is
required
to
publish,
and
at
that
time
the
name
of
the
owner
as
reflected
by
the
records
of
the
county
treasurer
appear
in
the
publication
and
the
illegal
description
of
the
property
in
the
amount
of
tax
due,
and
i
believe
that
there
maybe
some
other
matter.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
surface
owner.
well,
that’s
only
record
in
the
county
treasurer's
office
is
the
name
and
address
of
the
party
to
whom
which
are
paying
the
tax.
in
that
case
it
is
the
surface
owner.
in
many
cases,
if
there
are
undivided
interests
in
the
surface
owner,
they
may
have
more
than
one
name.
now
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
1965,
the
oklahoma
legislature
changed
the
statute
on
resale
tax
deed
requiring
not
only
publication,
but
also
a
mailing
of
a
notice
to
the
owner
as
reflected
by
the
county
assessor’s
office.
now
as
to
position
to
appellees
that
this
clearly
wasn’t
application
of
the
oklahoma
legislature
of
the
rules
of
the
mullane
and
the
subsequent
case.
since
prior
of
that
time
the
surface
owner
even
though
he
paid
the
tax,
the
only
notice
given
was
a
publication
notice.
and
i
think
if
i
was
in
the
position
to
having
to
argue
before
this
court
that
that
was
the
same
situation
with
the
mineral
owners
in
face
of
mullane
and
the
other
cases,
i
could
not
prevail.
clearly,
i
think
the
legislature
in
‘65
when
they
amended
the
statute
and
required
not
only
publication
with
the
owners
name
in
it,
but
also
mailing
to
his
last
known
address
and
reflected
by
the
record
of
county
treasurer,
they
complied
with
mullane
and
were
attempting
to
comply
with
mullane.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that’s
correct.
now,
i
think
the
court
must
recognize
that
oklahoma
is
a
major
producer
of
oil
and
gas.
it
has
been
so
for
a
number
of
years.
great
industries
exist
in
oklahoma
based
upon
the
production
of
oil
and
gas.
people
since
statehood
have
become
cognizant
and
aware
of
the
value
of
mineral
interest
and
thus
it
is
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
in
oklahoma,
nowadays,
that
you
find
a
piece
of
ground
which
the
minerals
have
not
been
settled.
and
in
many
cases,
if
there
has
been
production
that
has
seized,
you
may
find
thousands,
literally
of
various
owners,
the
interest
of
which
is
almost
beyond
imagination.
and
i
am
not
aware
as
to
whether
any
of
you
justices
have
had
occasion
to
examine
the
title
for
oil
and
gas
and
rendering
opinion,
but
i
assure
the
court
that
it
results
in
sometimes
interests
that
are,
you
have
to
use
a
computer
to
determine
the
size.
now,
based
upon
counsel’s
argument
for
the
appellants,
all
of
these
individuals
would
be
entitled
to
notice.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
no,
your
honor,
it
could
be
out
as
many
as
7
to
8
decimal
places.
the
interest
as
i
say
many
of
the
original
oil
and
gas
fuels
in
oklahoma
are
no
longer
producing
and
the
minerals
then
became
non-producing,
and
subject
again
to
ad
valorem
tax
by
the
surface.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
well,
if
it
please
the
court,
oklahoma
is
an
abstract
title
state.
the
owner
of
the
surface
has
an
abstract
of
title.
all
of
the
oil
companies
in
purchasing
leases
rely
upon
abstracts
by
bonded
abstracters
who
are
examined
by
attorney.
these
abstracts
were
compiled
by
the
abstracter
going
to
the
county
records,
searching
out
all
of
the
various
records,
arrangements
that
have
been
recorded.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
county
clerk.
well
the
county
clerk
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
recording
instruments,
all
deeds,
mortgages,
leases,
anything
about
the
property.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
no,
it’s
called
the
county
clerk
your
honor.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that’s
correct.
it
would
reflect
to
any
mineral
deeds
if
the
abstracter
wasn’t
instructed
to
obtain
that
type
of
the
abstract.
it’s
possible
the
abstracter
a
piece
of
property
only
as
to
the
surface
and
will
omit
the
minerals,
which
in
many
cases
because
of
the
size
of
the
abstract
that’s
done.
but,
at
this
i
point
out
that
–
and
one
of
my
arguments
is
the
great
difficulty
that
counsel
for
the
appellant
asked
this
court
to
place
upon
the
county
treasurer.
oklahoma
is
the
track
index
state
that
is
when
i
am
walk
in
and
i
file
a
deed
covering
a
certain
piece
of
property,
reference
to
that
deed
is
first
made
in
the
reception
record
indicating
that
it
was
tendered
for
recording.
then
it
is
mechanically
put
on
an
index
book
in
particular
quarter
section
township
and
arranging
so
forth.
indicating
that
on
a
certain
day,
certain
warranty
deed
to
somebody
from
somebody,
covering
a
certain
property
where
it
was
recorded.
that
deed
is
then
reproduced
photographically,
or
in
early
by
hand,
in
another
book
and
page,
in
another
book.
and
in
order
to
find
the
details
of
the
conveyance
such
as
the
interest
covered
so
forth
and
any
addresses
that
might
appear
would
require
first
of
all
that
a
party
go
to
the
track
index
book,
research
the
title
from
(inaudible)
to
determine
where
a
particular
deed
came
in
the
chain
of
title,
or
any
particular
deeds
covering
minerals
or
which
might
purport
to
covering
minerals,
or
might
be
overriding
all
interest,
or
some
type
of
reservation
of
life
estate
or
so
forth
in
the
mineral.
then
the
party
would
have
to
take
the
book
and
page
of
each
of
this
instruments,
go
then
to
the
general
recording
data
and
examine
each
of
the
instruments
in
order
to
find
out
what
exactly
the
instrument
said,
because
the
reference
in
the
track
index
book
is
merely
to
date
it
was
recorded,
the
nature
of
the
instrument
whether
it
be
warranty
deed,
mineral
deed,
quick
claim
deed,
mortgage
and
the
names
of
the
grantor
and
the
grantee,
and
the
legal
description
of
the
property.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
yes,
your
honor,
there
is.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
alright,
i’ll
explain
it
this
way,
your
honor,
that
if
the
county
is
not
required
to
bid
at
the
tax
certificate
sale,
the
county’s
done
with
the
thing
it’s
up
to
the
individual
tax
certificate
holder
to
proceed
further
if
he
wants
to
acquire
the
property.
if
there
are
no
bidders
in
the
county
as
required
by
law
to
the
bid
property
in,
we
then
go
to
the
resale.
at
the
resale,
you
can
buy
the
tax,
the
property
for
anything
less
than
what
the
tax
is
due,
or
anything
more.
it
is
my
opinion
and
of
course
not
being
a
member
of
legislature,
i
don’t
know
the
reasoning
behind
it,
but
it
is
my
opinion
in
order
to
make
it
attractive
since
the
taxes
are
now
delinquent
for
four
years
for
a
person
to
bid
at
the
resale,
the
legislature
deemed
that
it
be
viable
if
you
bid,
then
the
county
will
give
you
a
perfect
virgin
title
of
that
property.
and
that
is
to
encourage
bid,
since
they’ve
already
been
aware
on
one
time
and
have
received
no
bids,
and
the
second
time
out,
the
county
can
sell
it
for
less
than
the
tax
is
due
or
more,
if
there
are
a
number
of
bidders.
but
at
that
point,
if
the
county
does
not,
if
there
are
no
bidders
at
the
resale,
then
the
county
is
required
to
bid
it
in,
and
it
is
deeded
to
the
county
commissioners.
(voice
overlap)excuse
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
i
would
not
say
that
that
could
not
conceivably
happen
your
honor.[laughter]
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
the
law
is
very
clear
in
oklahoma,
producing
mineral
interests
are
the
in
loop
growth
production
tax,
the
tax
deeds
do
not
cover
producing
minerals.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
well,
the
amount
of
production
determines
the
amount
of
tax.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
no,
as
i
understand
the
operator.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
--
the
working
interest
gets
up
for
like
a
sales
tax
order.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
sort
of,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
in
my
understanding
to
the
operators.
but
i
would
point
out
i
think
we
rely
most
heavily
on
the
case
of
lee
versus
green,
which
we
realized
is
a
very
old
case,
but
i
still
think
it
is
very
sound
and
of
the
basic
points
of
that
case,
the
court
there
said
the
process
of
taxation
does
not
require
the
same
kind
of
notice
as
it
was
required
in
suit
at
law.
or
even
in
proceedings
for
the
taking
of
private
property
under
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
it
involves
no
violation
of
due
process
of
law
when
it
is
executed
according
to
customary
forms
and
established
usages,
or
in
subordination
to
the
principles
which
underlie
that.
and
i
submit
that
the
form
of
procedure
employed
in
oklahoma
has
been
that
way
since
statehood
for
more
than
60
years
that
this
almost
this
exact
procedure
except
there’s
slightly
change
in
1965
it’s
been
impossible.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that’s
lee
versus
green.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
yes,
it
is.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
yes,
this
is
a
case
involving
the
nebraska’s
tax
law
in
which
you
involve
the
land
holder
on
the
piece
of
property
and
an
administrative
sale
in
it.
i
consider
that
they
dealt
–
this
case
was
in
rem
and
created
a
new
and
independent
title.
i
realized
that
this
court
apparently
in
mullane
indicated
that
whether
it
was
in
rem
or
in
personam
was
not
necessary
the
criteria
for
determining
whether
you
know,
you
were
entitled
to
personal
notice
or
whether
publication
notice
was
sufficient.
but
i
submit
this
court
did
not
destroy
the
distinction
between
the
two,
it
merely
said
that
it
is
not
necessary
controlling
it,
and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that
decision.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
well,
the
producer
that
is
the
part
of
who
is
operating
the
well,
and
collects
the
money
from
the
sale,
pays
it
directly
that
state
the
--
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
when
i
received
my
royalty
check
if
i
was
fortunate
to
own
minerals
that
they
were
producing.
it
would
be,
it
would
show
the
gross
production,
last
gross
production
taxed
net
to
me
and,
that’s
all
i
would
receive.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
procedures
implied
in
that
situation.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
it
is
certainly
an
over
sight
on
my
part
your
honor,
because
i
have
always
considered
that
my
stallwood
case.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
alright,
there
are
some
states
that
do
not
use
abstracts
of
title
and
employ
private
companies
to
search
out
for
it.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
no,
your
honor,
i
wanted
the
court
to
be
absolute
certain
as
to
the
burden
they
would
place
upon
the
county
treasurer,
if
they
require
the
county
treasurer
to
embark
upon
the
search.
bearing
in
mind,
it
would
not
necessarily
to
be
one
property
but
could
be
hundreds
of
properties
that
were
then
delinquent.
and
i
feel
like
that
is
a
burden
at
this
court
has
not
required
in
the
mullane
or
the
subsequent
cases.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
the
distinction,
i
draw
there
in
the
individual,
the
tax
has
been
sold,
and
the
state
is
no
longer
involved.
it
is
a
private
individual
acting
and
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
private
individual
enforcing
a
right
he
has
obtained
from
the
state
and
in
my
mind
and
the
right
of
the
state
to
still
attempt
to
collect
their
tax.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
if
the
court
does
not
feel
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
barred
the
appellant’s
right
to
recover
which
i
strongly
believe
has.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that
the
lower
court
found
that.
i
cannot
explain
to
this
court
in
anyway
while
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
made
no
reference
to
the
finding
by
the
trial
court
that
the
statute
of
limitations
barred.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
i
raised
it
simply
because
i
think
the
record
shows
it.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
no,
your
honor.
we
were
there
on
certiorari
from
the
adverse
decision
to
the
appellees
by
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
which
reversed
the
trial
court
in
the
--
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
yes,
your
honor,
i
certainly
do
and
i
would
like
to
comment
that,
and
i
cite
in
my
brief
bomford
versus
socony
mobile
oil
company
which
is
a
supreme
court
case
for
oklahoma
where
they
applied
the
mullane
rules
to
service
by
publication
and
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court,
the
last
paragraph
from
the
last
paragraph
of
that
case.
it
says
“mindful
of
our
duties
guard
against
any
attempt
to
upsets
settled
titles
by
the
imposition
of
new
requirements
which
did
not
exist
before
we
declared
all
procedural
modifications
enunciated
herein,
shall
not
be
construed
as
invalidating
the
publication
process
in
the
case
or
in
any
case
in
which
the
trial
judgment
shall
have
been
rendered
before
the
opinion
becomes
final.”
now
i
submit
that
if
this
court
holds
that
the
statute
of
limitations
has
no
application,
then
every
tax
deed
issued,
every
resale
tax
deed
issued
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
since
statehood
is
subject
to
attack.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
i
think
it’s
the
matter
this
must
consider.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
no,
consider
--
what
a
decision
by
this
court
would
to
titles
within
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that
was
one
of
the
trial
court’s
principle
findings.
it
appears
in
the
appendix
at
the
trial
court’s
judgment.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that’s
correct.
there
are
oklahoma
cases
which
relied
upon
that.
the
most
recent
of
which
was
offered
to
this
court
in
1949,
and
was
rejected.
the
cornelius
versus
jackson
i
believe
the
case
was.
but
i
have
no
dispute,
your
honor,
what
the
courts
rulings
in
mullane,
or
city
of
new
york,
of
(inaudible),
or
walker,
or
wisconsin,
or
schroeder.
i
have
no
objection
to
all
because
i
think
those
were
proper
results
of
the
facts
that
were
before
the
court.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
and
there
was
a
kansas
case
very
similar.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
but
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
present
sufficient
fact
to
allow
the
court
to
apply
the
rule
on
mullane.
the
rule
on
mullane
simply
says,
if
the
names
are
known
or
if
they
are
very
easily
ascertainable
then
you
must
give
personal
notice,
or
something
better
than
publication.
there
are
absolutely
no
evidentiary
facts
in
this
case
that
would
warrant
this
court
of
saying
that
the
rule
should
be
blankly
applied.
no
facts
at
all.
the
one
witness
testified
at
the
trial.
there
were
certain
stipulations
that
no
personal
notice
was
received.
i
think
it
would
be
extremely
dangerous
for
the
court
to
embark
upon
a
strict
application
of
mullane
without
having
that
evidentiary
fact
before
the
court
as
to
whether
is
or
isn’t.
i
will
argue
that
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
find
the
names
of
these
parties
and
mr.
legg
will
argue
the
opposite,
but
that
does
not
constitute
a
fact
that
this
court
should
predicate
a
decision
upon
it.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
it
appears
in
great
detail
in
the
journal
after
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
well,
also
that
not
only
the
deed
was
issued
in
compliance
with
all
the
statutory
requirements
but
that
the
five
year
statute
of
limitations
indeed
applied,
and
that
the
party,
the
appellees
have
been
open
untoward
possession,
that
maybe
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
and
not
reducing
for
the
court
in
the
appendix.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
i
believe
so.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
no,
requirement
that
the
mineral
deeds
be
filed
but
in
most
cases
they
are.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
in
my
opinion,
it
would
your
honor.
it
would
require
skilled
parties
not
just
--
they
would
have
to
determine
the
nature
of
the
interest
not
only
just
because
a
mineral
deed
appeared
then
you
would
have
to
check
to
see
where
that
interest
had
been
conveyed
at.
you
must
ultimately
arrive
at
who
the
present
owners
are
or
you
haven’t
accomplished
anything.
there
maybe
--
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
you
mean
the
county
treasurer?
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
no,
your
honor
but
i
don’t
think
that
you
cannot
say
that
every
piece
of
property
is
going
to
have
just
one
deed
that
therein
lies
the
problem.
i
think
that
we
may
in
most
cases
be
dealing
with
literally
hundreds
rather
than
one.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
very
easily,
your
honor.
160
acres
of
land,
the
mineral
interest
as
i’ve
point
out
the
court
can
be
divided
up
as
many
as
six
decimal
places.
the
interest
is
just
--
it’s
very
difficult,
i
understand
for
justice
to
--
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
yes,
that’s
true.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
because
their
names
would
appear
on
the
records
of
county
treasurer,
if
they
are
being
assessed
as
to
their
interest.
but
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
facts
that
the
name
of
the
non-producing
mineral
owners
does
not
appear
on
the
county
records
or
the
county
treasurer’s
office.
and
i
--
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
but
i
cite
to
the
court,
the
case
of
ponder
versus
ebby
which
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
there
specifically
held
that
it
was
the
legislature’s
intent
that
the
county
treasurer
was
not
to
look
beyond
his
own
records
in
throwing
notices.
and
i
think
that
was
clearly
the
intent
of
the
legislature
and
the
--
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
no,
your
honor.
but
that
was
their
intent
and
not
requiring
that
he
go
outside
of
his
office.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
ponder
versus
ebby.
thank
you.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that’s
correct
your
honor,
and
i
--
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
the
original
parties
are
deceased
in
their
administrators
and
executors
have
been
substitute.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
the
appellees,
the
purchasers
at
the
resale
tax.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
the
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
the
first
adjudication
by
the
trial
court
at
‘65
was
that
the
oil
company
did
have
a
valid
lease.
it
had
leases
from
both
parties
at
that
time.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
as
i
pointed
out
to
court,
i
did
not
try
the
original
case
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
mr.
legg
maybe
able
to
answer
the
court.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i
believe
it
is
absolutely
imperative
that
the
chronological
order
of
facts
as
to
how
this
case
reached
this
court
to
be
spelled
out.
first,
we’re
dealing
with
40
acres
of
land
in
seminole
county
as
mr.
legg
has
indicated.
the
taxes
became
delinquent
for
four
years,
first
delinquency
occurred
in
‘52
and
subsequently
until
’55.
in
56
a
resale,
1956
a
resale
tax
deed
was
issued
in
may
to
the
appellees.
it
was
filed
of
record
on
june
the
6th,
1956,
and
it
covered
in
addition
to
the
40
acres
some
12
other
partial
to
real
estate.
thereafter,
in
1963,
the
appellees
executed
an
oil
and
gas
lease
to
christie-stewart
oil
company,
who
was
actually
the
party
plaintiff
when
this
litigation
first
arose.
during
the
period
from
1956
until
1965
when
the
lawsuit
was
filed,
the
trial
court
found
that
the
appellees
had
been
an
open,
notorious,
and
adverse,
and
in
continuous
possession
of
the
property.
and
one
of
the
elements
of
the
holding
of
the
trial
court
was
that
the
claims
of
the
appellants
was
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
suit
by
the
oil
company
was
filed
in
1965
in
order
to
perfect
their
lease,
because
their
attorneys
who
examined
the
title
of
course
realized
that
this
was
a
resale
tax
deed,
and
there
was
always
a
degree
of
uncertainty
about
its
validity.
the
appellants
then
filed
an
answer
in
the
cross-petitioner
and
brought
in
the
appellees
as
party’s
defendant.
the
appellees
then
filed
an
answer
to
the
cross--petitioner
which
they
specifically
raised
the
statute
of
limitation
that
the
appellants
were
barred.
the
first
issues
in
the
case
the
validity
of
the
oil
and
gas
lease
was
adjudicated
by
the
trial
court
in
1965.
and
then
for
some
reason,
unknown
to
my
self
since
i
was
not
personally
involved
in
the
original
trial,
the
issues
as
between
the
appellant
and
the
appellees
was
not
decided
until
1969.
during
that
period,
an
oil
well
was
drilled
upon
the
property
and
production
headed.
and
i’m
sure
that
keenly
increased
interest
of
all
parties
when
that
occurred.
i
think
it
is
also
absolutely
necessary
that
this
court
have
a
crystal
clear
understanding
of
the
statutory
procedure
on
tax
sales
in
oklahoma.
first
of
all,
the
statutes
hold
that
it
is
the
burden
of
the
taxpayer
to
come
forward
and
pay
his
tax.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
as
to
the
surface
owner,
yes,
your
honor,
to
come
forward
and
pay
the
tax.
mr.
legg
is
correct
and
that
non-producing
oil
and
gas
interest
are
not
subject
to
ad
valorem
on
tax.
they
are
deemed
included
in
the
surface.
only
when
production
first
arises
do
severed
mineral
bear
any
ad
valorem
tax,
and
that
is
in
lieu
of
tax
for
growth
production.
after
the
tax
has
become
delinquent,
there
is
a
certificate
sale
which
occurred.
at
that
time,
the
county
treasurer
runs
a
publication
saying
forth
illegal
description
of
the
property
in
amount
of
tax
due.
any
party
can
then
come
in
and
buy
a
certificate.
this
allows
the
party
to
have
a
lien
upon
land.
one
of
the
requirements
at
that
time
is
that
the
purchaser
must
pay
the
full
amount
of
the
tax.
so,
at
that
period,
the
county
treasurer
has
collected
this
tax.
he
has
performed
his
service
as
required
by
law
and
collected
100
cents
on
the
dollar
for
the
delinquent
taxes.
the
certificates
holder
then
is
required
to
hold
the
tax
certificate
for
at
least
two
years,
and
anytime
after
2
years
and
before
10
years
which
bars
the
certificate
by
statute
of
limitations,
he
may
apply
to
the
county
treasurer
for
a
tax
deed.
now
the
specific
statute
that
gives
the
tax
certificate
holder
that
right
provides
that
he
will
obtain
upon
receipt
of
the
tax
deed
from
the
county
treasurer,
a
perfect
title
provided
that
the
tax
certificate
holder
give
notice
to
all
of
the
owners
of
the
property.
not
owners
as
reflected
by
the
records
of
the
county
treasurer's
office,
but
all
of
the
owners.
now
there
in
lies
the
distinction
--
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that
that
is
correct.
and
the
oklahoma
supreme
court
has
by
numerous
cases
held
that
the
term
owner
as
used
in
that
statute
and
placing
that
burden
upon
the
tax
certificate
holder
includes,
mortgages,
it
includes
any
land
holder
it
includes
severed
mineral
interest
and
so
forth.
now,
mr.
legg
has
referred
to
some
confusion
between
the
supreme
court
and
of
oklahoma
and
the
case
involving
a
tax
certificate
deed
when
it
did
not
apply
the
statute
of
limitations.
the
distinction
in
that
case
is
that
it
was
a
certificate
deed,
and
it
was
stipulated
in
that
case
that
the
tax
certificate
holder
when
he
applied
for
the
tax
deed,
did
not
give
the
statutory
notice
to
the
then
mineral
owner.
and
the
court
said
that
one
of
the
conditions
precedent
to
you
acquiring
your
appropriate
title
is
that
you
fulfill
your
obligation,
my
statute
and
give
the
notice.
and
therefore
since
you
did
not
give
the
notice,
the
mineral
holder’s
interest
was
never
acquired
by
your
certificate
deed.
therefore
having
never
acquired
his
interest,
the
statute
of
limitations
would
not
run,
because
you
were
not
in
possession
of
his
interest,
having
not
acquired
it
in
the
deed.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
walker
versus
hoffman,
your
honor.
that’s
set
forth
in
our
brief.
now
if,
as
mr.
legg
has
indicated,
if
there
are
no
bidders
at
the
tax
sale
then
the
property
is
bid
in
by
the
county
treasurer
and
he
is
required
by
law
to
hold
the
taxes
for
two
years.
during
this
period
of
time,
anyone
having
any
interest
in
property
is
free
to
redeem.
the
supreme
court
has
also
held
that
a
non-producing
mineral
holder
may
redeem
taxes
at
anytime
and
there
by
obtains
a
lien
upon
the
interest
of
the
surface
owner,
and
may
enforce
that
lien
by
equitable
foreclosure.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that’s
correct,
and
i
don’t
think
mr.
legg
would
raise
any
issue
about
our
present
statute
and
tax
certificate.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
as
to
the
tax
certificate,
yes,
sir.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
because
it
does
require
notice
to
the
owner.
now
when
the
property
then
moves
on
to
the
county
treasurer,
and
the
county
treasurer
under
the
law
as
it
existed
at
the
time
this
deed
was
issued,
is
required
to
publish.
after
two
years,
no
redemption
is
required
to
publish,
and
at
that
time
the
name
of
the
owner
as
reflected
by
the
records
of
the
county
treasurer
appear
in
the
publication
and
the
illegal
description
of
the
property
in
the
amount
of
tax
due,
and
i
believe
that
there
maybe
some
other
matter.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
surface
owner.
well,
that’s
only
record
in
the
county
treasurer's
office
is
the
name
and
address
of
the
party
to
whom
which
are
paying
the
tax.
in
that
case
it
is
the
surface
owner.
in
many
cases,
if
there
are
undivided
interests
in
the
surface
owner,
they
may
have
more
than
one
name.
now
it
is
interesting
to
note
that
in
1965,
the
oklahoma
legislature
changed
the
statute
on
resale
tax
deed
requiring
not
only
publication,
but
also
a
mailing
of
a
notice
to
the
owner
as
reflected
by
the
county
assessor’s
office.
now
as
to
position
to
appellees
that
this
clearly
wasn’t
application
of
the
oklahoma
legislature
of
the
rules
of
the
mullane
and
the
subsequent
case.
since
prior
of
that
time
the
surface
owner
even
though
he
paid
the
tax,
the
only
notice
given
was
a
publication
notice.
and
i
think
if
i
was
in
the
position
to
having
to
argue
before
this
court
that
that
was
the
same
situation
with
the
mineral
owners
in
face
of
mullane
and
the
other
cases,
i
could
not
prevail.
clearly,
i
think
the
legislature
in
‘65
when
they
amended
the
statute
and
required
not
only
publication
with
the
owners
name
in
it,
but
also
mailing
to
his
last
known
address
and
reflected
by
the
record
of
county
treasurer,
they
complied
with
mullane
and
were
attempting
to
comply
with
mullane.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that’s
correct.
now,
i
think
the
court
must
recognize
that
oklahoma
is
a
major
producer
of
oil
and
gas.
it
has
been
so
for
a
number
of
years.
great
industries
exist
in
oklahoma
based
upon
the
production
of
oil
and
gas.
people
since
statehood
have
become
cognizant
and
aware
of
the
value
of
mineral
interest
and
thus
it
is
the
exception
rather
than
the
rule
in
oklahoma,
nowadays,
that
you
find
a
piece
of
ground
which
the
minerals
have
not
been
settled.
and
in
many
cases,
if
there
has
been
production
that
has
seized,
you
may
find
thousands,
literally
of
various
owners,
the
interest
of
which
is
almost
beyond
imagination.
and
i
am
not
aware
as
to
whether
any
of
you
justices
have
had
occasion
to
examine
the
title
for
oil
and
gas
and
rendering
opinion,
but
i
assure
the
court
that
it
results
in
sometimes
interests
that
are,
you
have
to
use
a
computer
to
determine
the
size.
now,
based
upon
counsel’s
argument
for
the
appellants,
all
of
these
individuals
would
be
entitled
to
notice.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
no,
your
honor,
it
could
be
out
as
many
as
7
to
8
decimal
places.
the
interest
as
i
say
many
of
the
original
oil
and
gas
fuels
in
oklahoma
are
no
longer
producing
and
the
minerals
then
became
non-producing,
and
subject
again
to
ad
valorem
tax
by
the
surface.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
well,
if
it
please
the
court,
oklahoma
is
an
abstract
title
state.
the
owner
of
the
surface
has
an
abstract
of
title.
all
of
the
oil
companies
in
purchasing
leases
rely
upon
abstracts
by
bonded
abstracters
who
are
examined
by
attorney.
these
abstracts
were
compiled
by
the
abstracter
going
to
the
county
records,
searching
out
all
of
the
various
records,
arrangements
that
have
been
recorded.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
county
clerk.
well
the
county
clerk
is
charged
with
the
responsibility
of
recording
instruments,
all
deeds,
mortgages,
leases,
anything
about
the
property.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
no,
it’s
called
the
county
clerk
your
honor.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that’s
correct.
it
would
reflect
to
any
mineral
deeds
if
the
abstracter
wasn’t
instructed
to
obtain
that
type
of
the
abstract.
it’s
possible
the
abstracter
a
piece
of
property
only
as
to
the
surface
and
will
omit
the
minerals,
which
in
many
cases
because
of
the
size
of
the
abstract
that’s
done.
but,
at
this
i
point
out
that
–
and
one
of
my
arguments
is
the
great
difficulty
that
counsel
for
the
appellant
asked
this
court
to
place
upon
the
county
treasurer.
oklahoma
is
the
track
index
state
that
is
when
i
am
walk
in
and
i
file
a
deed
covering
a
certain
piece
of
property,
reference
to
that
deed
is
first
made
in
the
reception
record
indicating
that
it
was
tendered
for
recording.
then
it
is
mechanically
put
on
an
index
book
in
particular
quarter
section
township
and
arranging
so
forth.
indicating
that
on
a
certain
day,
certain
warranty
deed
to
somebody
from
somebody,
covering
a
certain
property
where
it
was
recorded.
that
deed
is
then
reproduced
photographically,
or
in
early
by
hand,
in
another
book
and
page,
in
another
book.
and
in
order
to
find
the
details
of
the
conveyance
such
as
the
interest
covered
so
forth
and
any
addresses
that
might
appear
would
require
first
of
all
that
a
party
go
to
the
track
index
book,
research
the
title
from
(inaudible)
to
determine
where
a
particular
deed
came
in
the
chain
of
title,
or
any
particular
deeds
covering
minerals
or
which
might
purport
to
covering
minerals,
or
might
be
overriding
all
interest,
or
some
type
of
reservation
of
life
estate
or
so
forth
in
the
mineral.
then
the
party
would
have
to
take
the
book
and
page
of
each
of
this
instruments,
go
then
to
the
general
recording
data
and
examine
each
of
the
instruments
in
order
to
find
out
what
exactly
the
instrument
said,
because
the
reference
in
the
track
index
book
is
merely
to
date
it
was
recorded,
the
nature
of
the
instrument
whether
it
be
warranty
deed,
mineral
deed,
quick
claim
deed,
mortgage
and
the
names
of
the
grantor
and
the
grantee,
and
the
legal
description
of
the
property.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
yes,
your
honor,
there
is.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
alright,
i’ll
explain
it
this
way,
your
honor,
that
if
the
county
is
not
required
to
bid
at
the
tax
certificate
sale,
the
county’s
done
with
the
thing
it’s
up
to
the
individual
tax
certificate
holder
to
proceed
further
if
he
wants
to
acquire
the
property.
if
there
are
no
bidders
in
the
county
as
required
by
law
to
the
bid
property
in,
we
then
go
to
the
resale.
at
the
resale,
you
can
buy
the
tax,
the
property
for
anything
less
than
what
the
tax
is
due,
or
anything
more.
it
is
my
opinion
and
of
course
not
being
a
member
of
legislature,
i
don’t
know
the
reasoning
behind
it,
but
it
is
my
opinion
in
order
to
make
it
attractive
since
the
taxes
are
now
delinquent
for
four
years
for
a
person
to
bid
at
the
resale,
the
legislature
deemed
that
it
be
viable
if
you
bid,
then
the
county
will
give
you
a
perfect
virgin
title
of
that
property.
and
that
is
to
encourage
bid,
since
they’ve
already
been
aware
on
one
time
and
have
received
no
bids,
and
the
second
time
out,
the
county
can
sell
it
for
less
than
the
tax
is
due
or
more,
if
there
are
a
number
of
bidders.
but
at
that
point,
if
the
county
does
not,
if
there
are
no
bidders
at
the
resale,
then
the
county
is
required
to
bid
it
in,
and
it
is
deeded
to
the
county
commissioners.
(voice
overlap)excuse
mr.
justice
marshall.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
i
would
not
say
that
that
could
not
conceivably
happen
your
honor.[laughter]
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
the
law
is
very
clear
in
oklahoma,
producing
mineral
interests
are
the
in
loop
growth
production
tax,
the
tax
deeds
do
not
cover
producing
minerals.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
well,
the
amount
of
production
determines
the
amount
of
tax.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
no,
as
i
understand
the
operator.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
--
the
working
interest
gets
up
for
like
a
sales
tax
order.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
sort
of,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
in
my
understanding
to
the
operators.
but
i
would
point
out
i
think
we
rely
most
heavily
on
the
case
of
lee
versus
green,
which
we
realized
is
a
very
old
case,
but
i
still
think
it
is
very
sound
and
of
the
basic
points
of
that
case,
the
court
there
said
the
process
of
taxation
does
not
require
the
same
kind
of
notice
as
it
was
required
in
suit
at
law.
or
even
in
proceedings
for
the
taking
of
private
property
under
the
power
of
eminent
domain.
it
involves
no
violation
of
due
process
of
law
when
it
is
executed
according
to
customary
forms
and
established
usages,
or
in
subordination
to
the
principles
which
underlie
that.
and
i
submit
that
the
form
of
procedure
employed
in
oklahoma
has
been
that
way
since
statehood
for
more
than
60
years
that
this
almost
this
exact
procedure
except
there’s
slightly
change
in
1965
it’s
been
impossible.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that’s
lee
versus
green.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
yes,
it
is.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
yes,
this
is
a
case
involving
the
nebraska’s
tax
law
in
which
you
involve
the
land
holder
on
the
piece
of
property
and
an
administrative
sale
in
it.
i
consider
that
they
dealt
–
this
case
was
in
rem
and
created
a
new
and
independent
title.
i
realized
that
this
court
apparently
in
mullane
indicated
that
whether
it
was
in
rem
or
in
personam
was
not
necessary
the
criteria
for
determining
whether
you
know,
you
were
entitled
to
personal
notice
or
whether
publication
notice
was
sufficient.
but
i
submit
this
court
did
not
destroy
the
distinction
between
the
two,
it
merely
said
that
it
is
not
necessary
controlling
it,
and
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that
decision.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
well,
the
producer
that
is
the
part
of
who
is
operating
the
well,
and
collects
the
money
from
the
sale,
pays
it
directly
that
state
the
--
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
when
i
received
my
royalty
check
if
i
was
fortunate
to
own
minerals
that
they
were
producing.
it
would
be,
it
would
show
the
gross
production,
last
gross
production
taxed
net
to
me
and,
that’s
all
i
would
receive.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
procedures
implied
in
that
situation.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
it
is
certainly
an
over
sight
on
my
part
your
honor,
because
i
have
always
considered
that
my
stallwood
case.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
alright,
there
are
some
states
that
do
not
use
abstracts
of
title
and
employ
private
companies
to
search
out
for
it.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
no,
your
honor,
i
wanted
the
court
to
be
absolute
certain
as
to
the
burden
they
would
place
upon
the
county
treasurer,
if
they
require
the
county
treasurer
to
embark
upon
the
search.
bearing
in
mind,
it
would
not
necessarily
to
be
one
property
but
could
be
hundreds
of
properties
that
were
then
delinquent.
and
i
feel
like
that
is
a
burden
at
this
court
has
not
required
in
the
mullane
or
the
subsequent
cases.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that’s
correct,
your
honor.
the
distinction,
i
draw
there
in
the
individual,
the
tax
has
been
sold,
and
the
state
is
no
longer
involved.
it
is
a
private
individual
acting
and
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
private
individual
enforcing
a
right
he
has
obtained
from
the
state
and
in
my
mind
and
the
right
of
the
state
to
still
attempt
to
collect
their
tax.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
if
the
court
does
not
feel
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
barred
the
appellant’s
right
to
recover
which
i
strongly
believe
has.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that
the
lower
court
found
that.
i
cannot
explain
to
this
court
in
anyway
while
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals
and
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
made
no
reference
to
the
finding
by
the
trial
court
that
the
statute
of
limitations
barred.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
i
raised
it
simply
because
i
think
the
record
shows
it.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
no,
your
honor.
we
were
there
on
certiorari
from
the
adverse
decision
to
the
appellees
by
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
oklahoma
which
reversed
the
trial
court
in
the
--
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
yes,
your
honor,
i
certainly
do
and
i
would
like
to
comment
that,
and
i
cite
in
my
brief
bomford
versus
socony
mobile
oil
company
which
is
a
supreme
court
case
for
oklahoma
where
they
applied
the
mullane
rules
to
service
by
publication
and
i
would
like
to
read
to
the
court,
the
last
paragraph
from
the
last
paragraph
of
that
case.
it
says
“mindful
of
our
duties
guard
against
any
attempt
to
upsets
settled
titles
by
the
imposition
of
new
requirements
which
did
not
exist
before
we
declared
all
procedural
modifications
enunciated
herein,
shall
not
be
construed
as
invalidating
the
publication
process
in
the
case
or
in
any
case
in
which
the
trial
judgment
shall
have
been
rendered
before
the
opinion
becomes
final.”
now
i
submit
that
if
this
court
holds
that
the
statute
of
limitations
has
no
application,
then
every
tax
deed
issued,
every
resale
tax
deed
issued
in
the
state
of
oklahoma
since
statehood
is
subject
to
attack.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
i
think
it’s
the
matter
this
must
consider.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
no,
consider
--
what
a
decision
by
this
court
would
to
titles
within
the
state
of
oklahoma.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that
was
one
of
the
trial
court’s
principle
findings.
it
appears
in
the
appendix
at
the
trial
court’s
judgment.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
no,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that’s
correct.
there
are
oklahoma
cases
which
relied
upon
that.
the
most
recent
of
which
was
offered
to
this
court
in
1949,
and
was
rejected.
the
cornelius
versus
jackson
i
believe
the
case
was.
but
i
have
no
dispute,
your
honor,
what
the
courts
rulings
in
mullane,
or
city
of
new
york,
of
(inaudible),
or
walker,
or
wisconsin,
or
schroeder.
i
have
no
objection
to
all
because
i
think
those
were
proper
results
of
the
facts
that
were
before
the
court.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that’s
correct.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
and
there
was
a
kansas
case
very
similar.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
but
i
respectfully
submit
that
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
present
sufficient
fact
to
allow
the
court
to
apply
the
rule
on
mullane.
the
rule
on
mullane
simply
says,
if
the
names
are
known
or
if
they
are
very
easily
ascertainable
then
you
must
give
personal
notice,
or
something
better
than
publication.
there
are
absolutely
no
evidentiary
facts
in
this
case
that
would
warrant
this
court
of
saying
that
the
rule
should
be
blankly
applied.
no
facts
at
all.
the
one
witness
testified
at
the
trial.
there
were
certain
stipulations
that
no
personal
notice
was
received.
i
think
it
would
be
extremely
dangerous
for
the
court
to
embark
upon
a
strict
application
of
mullane
without
having
that
evidentiary
fact
before
the
court
as
to
whether
is
or
isn’t.
i
will
argue
that
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
find
the
names
of
these
parties
and
mr.
legg
will
argue
the
opposite,
but
that
does
not
constitute
a
fact
that
this
court
should
predicate
a
decision
upon
it.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
it
appears
in
great
detail
in
the
journal
after
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
well,
also
that
not
only
the
deed
was
issued
in
compliance
with
all
the
statutory
requirements
but
that
the
five
year
statute
of
limitations
indeed
applied,
and
that
the
party,
the
appellees
have
been
open
untoward
possession,
that
maybe
in
the
jurisdictional
statement,
and
not
reducing
for
the
court
in
the
appendix.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
i
believe
so.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
yes,
your
honor.
there
is
no,
requirement
that
the
mineral
deeds
be
filed
but
in
most
cases
they
are.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
in
my
opinion,
it
would
your
honor.
it
would
require
skilled
parties
not
just
--
they
would
have
to
determine
the
nature
of
the
interest
not
only
just
because
a
mineral
deed
appeared
then
you
would
have
to
check
to
see
where
that
interest
had
been
conveyed
at.
you
must
ultimately
arrive
at
who
the
present
owners
are
or
you
haven’t
accomplished
anything.
there
maybe
--
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
you
mean
the
county
treasurer?
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
no,
your
honor
but
i
don’t
think
that
you
cannot
say
that
every
piece
of
property
is
going
to
have
just
one
deed
that
therein
lies
the
problem.
i
think
that
we
may
in
most
cases
be
dealing
with
literally
hundreds
rather
than
one.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
very
easily,
your
honor.
160
acres
of
land,
the
mineral
interest
as
i’ve
point
out
the
court
can
be
divided
up
as
many
as
six
decimal
places.
the
interest
is
just
--
it’s
very
difficult,
i
understand
for
justice
to
--
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
yes,
that’s
true.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
because
their
names
would
appear
on
the
records
of
county
treasurer,
if
they
are
being
assessed
as
to
their
interest.
but
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
facts
that
the
name
of
the
non-producing
mineral
owners
does
not
appear
on
the
county
records
or
the
county
treasurer’s
office.
and
i
--
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
but
i
cite
to
the
court,
the
case
of
ponder
versus
ebby
which
the
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
there
specifically
held
that
it
was
the
legislature’s
intent
that
the
county
treasurer
was
not
to
look
beyond
his
own
records
in
throwing
notices.
and
i
think
that
was
clearly
the
intent
of
the
legislature
and
the
--
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
no,
your
honor.
but
that
was
their
intent
and
not
requiring
that
he
go
outside
of
his
office.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
ponder
versus
ebby.
thank
you.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
that’s
correct
your
honor,
and
i
--
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
the
original
parties
are
deceased
in
their
administrators
and
executors
have
been
substitute.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
the
appellees,
the
purchasers
at
the
resale
tax.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
the
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
the
first
adjudication
by
the
trial
court
at
‘65
was
that
the
oil
company
did
have
a
valid
lease.
it
had
leases
from
both
parties
at
that
time.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
as
i
pointed
out
to
court,
i
did
not
try
the
original
case
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
joe
s.
rolston
iii
mr.
legg
maybe
able
to
answer
the
court.
