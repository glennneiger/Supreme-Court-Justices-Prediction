justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
this
go
back
to
40
years
to
challenge
tax
sale
of
opportunity
described
as
a
non
deductive
mineral
interest?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no
i
didn't.
i
just
guessed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
that
because
the
mineral
owner
doesn’t
have
notice
from
a
new
surface
claimant
going
into
effect,
the
five
years
statute
doesn’t
apply
as
to
him.
is
there
any
statute
that
would
operate
on
the
nonproductive
mineral
claim?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
just
one
more
question
mr.
legg,
if
i
may
to
try
to
wind
up
this
one
aspect,
then,
as
to
a
non-producing
mineral
interest,
there
isn't
any
statute
limitations
in
oklahoma
that
would
bar
a
man
going
back
and
saying,
making
this
constitutional
claim
that
you
make
here
with
respect
to
a
sale
that
had
taken
place
20,
30,
40
years
ago.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
the
statute
of
limitations
for
a
resale
tax
deed?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
requires
some
sort
of
notice
doesn’t
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
going
into
possession?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
were
equating
going
into
possession
on
the
part
of
the
surface
claimant
with
a
form
of
notice
to
the
former
owner
to
start
this
statute
running.
there
is
no
analogous
going
into
possession
with
respect
to
a
nonproductive
mineral
interest,
is
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
true
of
a
certificate
of
sale
though,
is
it,
as
opposed
to
a
resale?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
certificate
tax
deed.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
there,
the
unsettling
effect
could
grow
back
indefinitely?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you’re
suggesting
is
that
the
5s,
15,
16th
and
116th
that
you
have
in
this
case
is
by
no
means
the
furthest
mathematical
progression
of
that
you
are
--
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
a
separate
grantor,
grantee
index
in
your
county
recorders
office?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rolston,
if
the
owner
of
the
producing
mineral
interest
becomes
delinquent
in
his
obligation
to
pay
the
lieu
tax.
can
that
be
made
a
lien
on
that
producing
interest
in
the
producing
interest
ultimately
sold
in
a
similar
proceeding
to
this?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
does
the
state
enforce
the
obligation
of
a
delinquent
owner
of
reproducing
if
he
has
to
pay
the
lieu
tax?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
he
doesn’t
pay?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
operator
who’s
obligated
to
pay
the
tax
or
the
producer
for
all
these
people
doesn’t
pay
it,
what
does
the
state
do?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supreme
court
of
oklahoma
didn’t
treat
in
its
opinion,
or
did
it?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rolston,
it’s
in
appendix
b
to
their
jurisdictional
statement
isn’t
it
though?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
this
go
back
to
40
