so
that’s
the
same
situation
with
respect
to
criminal
state
criminal
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
answered
that
you
said
you
couldn’t
go
into
federal
court
if
there
was
a
pending
proceeding,
but
it's
the
same
kind
of
an
argument,
you’re
making
now
was
made
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
gather
that
if
he
loses
in
the
civil
proceeding
and
that
either
he
repeals
or
he
doesn’t,
but
anyway
the
litigation
is
over
in
alabama
courts,
he
can’t
bring
in
1982
suit.
the
issue
has
been
decided
against
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
his
only
resort
is
appeal
or
cert
through
the
state
system
to
hear.
justice
byron

white
i
understand
that.
