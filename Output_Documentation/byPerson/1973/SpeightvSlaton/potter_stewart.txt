justice
potter
stewart
one
of
your
argument
or
at
least
are
you
making
the
alternative
argument
that
even
if
the
younger
doctrine
applies
to
this
case,
that
this
case
is
within
one
of
the
exceptions
recognized
by
younger,
is
that
the
reason
you
keep
telling
us
about
the
--
justice
potter
stewart
irreparable?
well,
before
you
can
have
an
injunction
anywhere
in
any
court
at
anytime
quite
a
part
from
younger
or
federalism
or
anything
else,
you
have
to
show
irreparable
harm,
don’t
you?
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
just
a
basic
equity
concept
before
they
can
be
an
injunction.
so
that
didn’t
get
you
anywhere?
justice
potter
stewart
but
are
you
telling
us
that
this
comes
within
one
of
the
exceptions
recognized
by
the
younger.
even
assuming,
that’s
even
assuming
this
were
as
where
as
my
brother
rehnquist
has
suggested
a
criminal
nuisance
statute
so
that
younger
would
be
clearly
applicable.
are
you
arguing
that
this
comes
within
one
of
the
exceptions
recognized
in
younger
that
would
allow
an
injunction
by
federal
court
of
a
state
criminal
proceeding?
justice
potter
stewart
i
wondered
why
you
were
talking
so
much
about
the
substantive
merits
of
your
claim
and
about
prior
restraint
and
i
assumed
that
it’s
only
materiality
could
be
--
could
reflect
that
alternative
argument?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
i
know
but
i
am
asking
about
your
argument.
justice
potter
stewart
suppose
that
the
question
is
quite
so
simple
as
you
imply
by
your,
just
what
you
said
in
conclusion
that
younger
should
not
apply
to
civil
cases,
don’t
you
think
possibly
that
it
might
apply
to
some
civil
cases
but
not
to
others?
justice
potter
stewart
i
hear
it’s
a
civil
case
in
which
the
state,
the
state
is
the
plaintiff.
normally
when
you
think
of
civil
cases,
we
think
of
cases
between
two
private
parties
in
a
state
or
federal
court.
here,
the
state
is
the
plaintiff.
the
state
is
the
plaintiff,
which
may
make
it
different
from
other
civil
cases?
as
the
state
suggest
it’s
an
aid
of
its
criminal
laws,
but
even
if
not
an
aid
or
its
criminal
laws,
it’s
sort
of
a
quasi-criminal
proceeding,
is
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
and
try
to
put
somebody
out
of
business
because
of
his
antisocial
behavior,
isn’t
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
it
pretty
much
reflex
the
same
purpose
that
criminal
laws
reflect,
does
it
not?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
trying
to
stop
somebody
from
doing
something
antisocial
--
justice
potter
stewart
--
which
is
different
from
many
other
sorts
of
civil
cases,
tort,
contract
cases,
divorces
cases,
and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
under
state
action
in
a
court
that
permits
racial
restrictive
covenant
such
as
been
held
to
be
state
action
insofar
as
the
court
permits
libel,
defamation
verdicts
that’s
been
held
to
be
state
action,
new
york
times
and
so
on.
justice
potter
stewart
so
that’s
not
the
whole
answer.
i
am
just
suggesting
that
the
answer
may
not
be
quite
so
simple
as
say,
younger
applies
to
civil
actions
or
it
doesn’t
apply
to
civil
actions.
it
may
apply
to
some,
some
kinds
and
not
to
other,
wouldn’t
you?
justice
potter
stewart
right.
justice
potter
stewart
now,
what’s
this
--
did
you
think
the
district
court
saw
as
an
abstention
case
or
as
a
case
that
should
be
dismissed
under
younger
against
harris.
justice
potter
stewart
the
judge
--
the
prevailing
opinion
just
simply
dismisses
and
talks
primarily
by
younger,
a
concurring
opinion
towards
about
abstention
and
dissenting
opinion
talks
a
little
about
abstention.
what
do
you
think
this
case
is
about?
is
it
an
abstention
case
or
is
it
a
dismissal
by
reason
of
younger
against
harris?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
there
is
no
majority
--
while
yes
there
is
because
the
concurring
opinion
toward
them
joined
the
opinion,
yes.
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
younger
doctrine
doesn’t
have
anything
at
all
really
to
do
with
abstention,
does
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it’s
quite
a
separate
doctrine,
consent?
justice
potter
stewart
i
see
if
you
have
the
alternative
--
if
i
have
the
alternative
as
you
suggest
in
your
state,
our
proceeding
by
way
of
the
criminal
law
and
the
criminal
prosecution
or
this
way
it's
just
the
absolute
quasi-criminal.
it’s
like,
an
analogy
is
a
federal
antitrust
laws.
that
the
federal
government
can
put
you
--
it
has
the
option
of
a
criminal
prosecution
or
a
civil
action
to
enjoin
the
alleged
wrongdoing
and
it
doesn’t
make
the
civil
action
quasi-criminal
institute
chosen
just
the
opposite
to
pursue
civilly.
justice
potter
stewart
that’s
why
we
are
dealing
mainly
in
semantics
and
perhaps
it’s
not
important
but
i
should
think
if
you
have
the
option
of
proceeding
criminally
or
by
this
method
is
this
is
just
by
definition
not
criminal?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
the
prosecution
is
not
going
into
the
court
to
find
out
what
the
law
is.
he
is
going
into
the
court
that
put
the
defendant
out
of
business
isn’t
he?
justice
potter
stewart
well
what
would
be
the
effect
of
the
injunction
be?
justice
potter
stewart
to
close
down
his
business,
wouldn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
as
you
also
represented
to
us,
nevertheless
this
is
really
very
clear
until
your
courts
pick
on
the
subject.
justice
potter
stewart
is
the
point
--
this
was
--
this
legislation
was
enacted
in
1971
i
think,
wasn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
say
so
in
the
brief
and
it
was
--
what
it
did
was
to
sort
of
tag
itself
on
to
incorporate
much
older
legislation
than
it
had
to
do
with
houses
of
prostitution,
is
that
it?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
but
26-2101
is
much
more
specific
than
that,
isn’t
it?
justice
potter
stewart
what?
justice
potter
stewart
and
under
which
statutory
provisions
did
you
perceive?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
isn’t
that
any
premises
in
violation
of
any
of
the
provisions
of
this
chapter
shall
constitute
public
nuisance?
justice
potter
stewart
right?
and
what
other
one?
justice
potter
stewart
any
nuisance
which
tends
to
the
immediate
annoyance
of
the
citizens
in
general
as
a
manifestly
injurious
to
the
public
health
and
safety
and
so
on?
justice
potter
stewart
and
those
were
all
the
statute?
justice
potter
stewart
and
generally,
have
been
applied
against
house
of
the
prostitution,
right?
justice
potter
stewart
chapter
72-3?
justice
potter
stewart
that
is
72-302?
justice
potter
stewart
right,
i
see,
i
think
see
it.
justice
potter
stewart
the
mitchum
case
had
that
sort
of
a
background.
of
course,
that
wasn’t
the
issue
in
that
case?
justice
potter
stewart
but
it
had
the
same
kind
of
background
as
this
case.
justice
potter
stewart
what’s
the
situation
here
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
he
is
closed
or
open
for
business?
justice
potter
stewart
why
and
how?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
federal
court
--
justice
potter
stewart
if
federal
court
declined
to
enjoin
the
state
proceedings
but
then
what?
was
the
stay
granted?
justice
potter
stewart
then
it's
just
suspending
pending
the
termination
of
this
litigation.
justice
potter
stewart
there
is
a
jury
trial
here,
is
there?
justice
potter
stewart
one
of
your
argument
or
at

are
