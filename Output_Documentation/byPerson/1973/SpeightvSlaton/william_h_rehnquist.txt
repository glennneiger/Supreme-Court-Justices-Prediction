so
if
the
meaning
there
is
only
in
the
sense
that
you
couldn’t
interrupt
an
already
commenced
a
judicial
proceeding.
it
would
certainly
have
a
lot
of
other
users
where
that
situation
didn’t
obtain?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
were
an
action
for
a
criminal
nuisance
prosecution
with
exactly
the
same
result,
you
would
clearly
be
barred
by
younger,
wouldn’t
you?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
wouldn’t
you
have
the
same
chilling
if
you
have
exactly
this
georgia
statute
on
the
books
that
you
have
except
it
was
a
criminal
statute
rather
than
a
civil
one?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there’s
no
use
at
all
that
state
can
make
of
the
result
of
this
civil
proceeding
at
any
subsequent
criminal
prosecution?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
we
can
always
deny
certiorari?
