justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
a
negative
quasi-criminal.
just
because
you
have
a
criminal
remedy
or
civil
remedy
doesn’t
make
the
civil
remedy
quasi-criminal,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
the
criminal
statute
or
to
the
general
peace
and
good
order
of
georgia?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
i
understand
here,
somebody
can
give
you
an
obscene
book
and
say
you
bought
it
and
reaches
department
store
and
you
can
close
the
department
store?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
there’d
be
no
criminal
proceedings
at
all?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
how
does
it
become
quasi-criminal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
closing
up
the
store
is
not
going
to
jail?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
you
find
something
contraband
and
you
destroy
it,
and
that’s
quasi-criminal?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it’s
a
good
problem.
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
can't
you
seize
all
the
books
and
tell
him
that
he
can’t
sell
obscene
books?
i
understand
you
seize
all
of
these
books,
don’t
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh!
i
see.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought
the
state
did
file
this
action?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that’s
state
action,
isn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
that’s
not
true.
the
statute
does
not
need
interpretation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
now
what
language
in
the
statute
needs
interpretation?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
no
decision
in
georgia
about
a
nuisance?
justice
thurgood
marshall
my
point
was,
is
there
any
decision
in
georgia
on
nuisance?
justice
thurgood
marshall
as
to
what
is
a
nuisance?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
should
hope
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that’s
--
that
word
is
not
vague.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what’s
vague
in
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
remedy
is
vague?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
the
statute
say?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
there’s
nothing
vague
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that’s
--
is
that
what’s
before
us,
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that’s
what
you
want
interpreted
by
the
court,
by
the
georgia
supreme
court,
the
statute?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
say
there’s
nothing
in
the
statute
that’s
vague?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
could
be
vague.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
imagine
if
you
apply
the
statute
to
a
gasoline
station
that
wouldn’t
apply,
would
that
have
made
it
vague?
justice
thurgood
marshall
have
we
got
a
prior
restraint
case
where
it
was
done
by
this
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
a
prior
restraint
case
where
this
court
did
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
agree
this
is
a
prior
restraint
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that’s
a
prior
restraint.
it
says
if
you
are
caught
with
an
obscene
book
you
might
lose
all
business?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
am
not
saying
we
did
or
did
not
but
i
want
to
know
if
you
know
of
any
case
in
which
this
court
where
there
has
been
an
alleged
obvious
prior
restraint,
the
court
had
said
we
will
yield
to
the
state.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don’t
think
it
necessarily
it
fills
ones
idea
that
but
i
was
just
wondering
if
there
was
one,
i
don’t
think
so.[voice

justice
thurgood
marshall
that
was
a
negative
quasi-criminal.
just
because
you
have
a
criminal
remedy
or
civil

doesn’t
make
the
civil

quasi-criminal,
does
it?
justice
thurgood
