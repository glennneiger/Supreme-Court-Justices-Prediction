do
they
(voice

did
the
jury
announced
their
vote
when
they
had
a
hung
trial
in
georgia?
chief

warren
e.
burger
that's
in
the
record,
is
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
oh!
if
it
isn't
in
the
record,
we're
not
interested
in
it.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
is
there
anything
involved,
which
do
you
think?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we
don't
know
yet,
do
we,
whether
all
of
the
books
could
be
forfeited
and
destroyed
until
the
supreme
court
to
the
highest
court
of
the
state
of
georgia
says
that
that's
the
reach
of
the
statute
and
that
it's
valid
or
perhaps
strikes
down
the
statute?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
we
do
sometimes
permit
the
highest
court
of
a
state
to
have
a
limiting
construction
of
its
own
status,
don't
we?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
i
think
we'll
begin
at
this
point
at
10:00
tomorrow
morning,
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
we’ll
resume
arguments
in
speight
against
slaton.
mr.
smith,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you’re
ready.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
are
you
--
are
you
saying
mr.
smith
that
it
is
inconceivable
that
the
state
court
would
say
that
this
statute,
the
state
statute
would
pass
constitutional
muster
for
them
as
the
state’s
highest
court
only
if
it
were
construed
and
not
to
reach
anything
except
to
obscene
materials.
haven’t
state
courts
exercise
that
kind
of
a
role
before?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
hence
the
state
court
found
that
none
of
this
material
was
obscene,
none
of
those
untoward
offense
would
occur,
would
they?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
unless
they
gave
it
a
narrowing
construction?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
you
have
nothing
left
except
the
state
courts?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
it
is
somewhat
analogous,
is
it
not,
to
proceedings
to
impound
and
perhaps
ultimately
destroy
contaminated
food
or
contaminated
drugs
where
there
is
no
purely
criminal
procedure,
but
a
forfeiture
procedure?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
roughly
we
have
said
that
in
certain
circumstances,
it
can
be
seized
and
impounded
pending
the
determination
of
its
--
in
the
case
of
food
or
drugs
it’s
contaminated
or
dangerous
condition?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
because
of
the
first
amendment
implications
and
all?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
but
i
was
speaking
procedurally
of
the
analogy.
it’s
analogous
to
some
of
the
things
that
were
mentioned
in
fuentes-shevin
--
fuentes
against
shevin.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
that
in
certain
circumstances,
speedy
action
is
required
by
the
state
that
isn’t
pure
civil
procedure
and
it
isn’t
a
pure,
certainly
is
the
criminal
procedure.
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
and
that’s
at
least
to
whether
it’s
correct
or
not,
that’s
georgia’s
theory
here,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
the
court
say
--
the
state
courts
might
rationalize
it?
chief
justice
warren
e.
burger
thank
you
mr.

mr.
moran.
