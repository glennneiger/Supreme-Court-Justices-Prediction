mr.
robert
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
originated
prior
to
the
decisions
by
this
court
in
june
of
1973,
and
so
the
district
court
was
not
in
the
position
to
being
guided
by
the
wisdom
of
those
decisions.
however,
it
does
come
from
the
same
jurisdiction
and
is
one
of
the
cases,
it
was
(inaudible),
it
was
argued
by
mr.
moran
and
myself
before
this
court,
and
which
was
decided
in
june
of
’73.
in
this
particular
case,
the
state
of
georgia
proceeded
under
a
civil
type
of
proceeding
to
entirely
close
an
adult
bookstore
on
the
concept
that
during
a
particular
period
of
time,
approximately
one-year
period
before
the
action
was
brought,
that
certain
publications
were
offered
for
sale
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
solicitor
were
considered
to
be
or
should've
been
considered
to
be
obscene.
during
that
entire
time
prior
to
the
bringing
of
the
civil
action,
only
one
case
was
in
fact
brought
to
trial.
that
criminal
case
ended
in
a
hung
jury,
i
think
it
was
4-1
that
are
being
a
5-man
jury
system,
and
ended
in
a
hung
jury,
4-1
and
mistrial
was
declared.
so
we
had
the
situation
which
none
of
the
publications,
by
virtue
of
the
criminal
process,
had
been
declared
to
be
obscene
by
a
jury.
mr.
robert
smith
well,
they
may
not
as
a
practical
matter,
your
honor.
but
in
this
case,
they
did
indicate
that
they
were
hung
and
that
it
was
4-1.
mr.
robert
smith
i
don't
believe
it
is
in
the
record.
i
think
it's
a
--
whether
it
was
transcribed
or
not
--
mr.
robert
smith
it
was
recognized
or
admitted
by
the
states,
your
honor,
at
the
time
of
the
proceedings
before
the
three-judge
court
and
was
noted
specially
in
the
opinion
of
just
--
judge
morgan
who
dissented
from
the
three-judge
opinion.
so
to
that
extent,
it's
in
the
record,
whether
it
is
stenographically
recorded
or
not,
i
don't
know.
mr.
robert
smith
yes,
sir.
i
would
though
--
think
so.
in
this
particular
case,
after
not
having
succeeded
in
that
particular
action,
they
went
about
to
bring
an
action
to
close
the
store
in
its
entirety
to
stop
the
store
from
--
the
people
from
operating
the
store
from
selling
anything
at
all
in
that
store.
there
was
no
concept
that
everything
in
the
store
was
obscene.
i
think
the
allegations
in
the
complaint
originally
filed
by
the
state
of
georgia
was
that
a
substantial
part
or
a
large
part
of
the
material
offered
for
sale
they
felt
could
be
or
would
be
deemed
to
be
obscene
under
the
georgia
law.
now,
this
was
filed.
we
sought
the
intervention
of
a
three-judge
court.
and
the
opinion
of
the
three-judge
court
was,
in
essence,
opinions
by
each
of
the
three
judges.
the
first
was
judge
muys
who,
writing
for
the
court
concurred
in
by
a
judge,
circuit
--
district
court
judge
o’kelley,
thought
that
one
of
the
issues
why
they
should
not
seek
to
go
forward
in
this
case
was
because
this
was
a
new
statute
and
the
new
statute
had
not
been
construed
by
a
--
by
the
state
supreme
court.
that's
first,
but
second
and
more
compelling
was
a
decision
of
the
circuit
court
in
peoli
versus
mckolf.
in
that
case,
the
petition
in
the
fifth
circuit,
this
--
that
case
had
not
been
appealed.
in
that
case,
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
federal
anticipatory
relief
would
be
inappropriate
in
that
--
this
case
and
we
are
to
meet
no
view
as
to
appellant’s
challenges
to
the
state
court
proceedings.
they
did
so
under
the
concept
of
the
fact
that
it
was
a
quasi
criminal
proceeding
that
it
was,
in
essence
in
aid
of
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law.
there,
there
was
attempted
seizure
of
films,
specific
films,
main
films,
which
were
to
be
utilized
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
and,
a
criminal
proceeding
was
brought
before
the
appeal
was
argued
in
the
fifth
circuit.
in
to
these
circumstances
what
we
had
is
that,
at
the
time
of
the
argument,
the
fifth
circuit,
the
decision
--
a
criminal
case
had
been
brought,
this
was
pending
and,
before
the
decision
by
the
fifth
circuit,
the
state
supreme
court
ruled
that
the
seizure
had
been
proper.
mr.
robert
smith
in
our
present
case?
mr.
robert
smith
it
was
brought
after
the
trial
disagreement
and
after
the
jury
was
unable
to
agree.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
smith
and
absent
in
that
determination,
as
i
said,
they
went
ahead
and
filed
the
nuisance
action.
mr.
jonathan,
the
--
judge
morgan
has
addressed
himself
to
that
in
his
dissenting
opinion
and
points
out
the
differences
in
that
case.
now
in
the
peoli
case
which
we
indicated,
that
case
related
to
a
specific
film.
now
in
80
drive-in
inc.
versus
baxley
which
was
decided
after
the
peoli
case
the
panel
said
that,
unlike
peoli
versus
mckolf,
this
case
presents
squarely
the
question
where
the
younger
v.
harris
precludes
federal
intervention
in
purely
civil
proceedings
as
well
as
state
criminal
prosecutions.
but
because
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
district
court
on
other
grounds,
we
intimate
no
resolution
of
this
question.
so,
they
did
not
--
they
clearly
indicated
they
did
not
resolve
that
question,
of
course
--
mr.
robert
smith
no,
sir.
it's
a
different
panel
and,
as
i
said,
they
indicated
that
they
had
not
resolved
that
question.
now,
after,
as
we
said,
we
filed
this
matter,
judge
morgan,
judge
o’kelley,
in
a
concurring
opinion
which
was
separate,
indicated
that
there
had
been
no
allegations
of
bad
faith
enforcement
of
the
law
or
harassment,
and
we
say
that
the
complaint
does
support
such
allegations.
we
did,
in
fact,
make
them.
we
did,
in
fact,
have
an
affidavit
by
counsel
setting
forth
specific
allegations
to
this
regard.
and
so,
we
say
judge
o’kelley
had
overlooked
that
particular
concept.
now
with
regard
to
the
specifics
here,
the
--
since
this
court
has
decided
a
--
decisions
on
june
21,
1973,
nuisance
actions
had
been
brought
and
prosecuted
in
various
other
jurisdictions.
this
court
has
before
it
now
a
case
involving
pursue
limited
--
hawkman
versus
pursue
limited
involving
the
question
of
nuisance
and
whether
or
not
the
store
can
be
entirely
closed
because
it's
operated
and
sells
a
single
publication
which
might
be
deemed
to
be
obscene.
mr.
robert
smith
that
is
the
ohio
case.
yes,
sir.
and,
as
judge
morgan
points
out
in
his
dissent
that
acting
under
this
statute,
agents
of
the
state
of
georgia
which
are
not
successful
in
criminal
prosecution
could
aviate
the
criminal
prosecution
and
go
forth,
and
because
one
publication
might
be
declared
obscene
in
a
civil
proceeding
by
a
single
judge
the
entire
store
could
be
closed
and
nothing
could
be
sold.
mr.
robert
smith
that
may
very
well
be
true.
yes,
sir.
but,
of
course,
that
doesn't
--
that
that's
not
a
construction
that
the
state
can
make
which
to
--
which
avoids
the
federal
question
that's
presented
in
this
case
we
suggest,
your
honor.
that
the
--
we're
saying
(inaudible),
here
on
its
face
--
that's
what
the
statute
says.
now,
a
limiting
construction
could
be
placed
upon
it
but
this
is
not
what
the
intent
was
certainly
of
the
people
who
were
prosecuting.
they
seek
stop
--
mr.
robert
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
smith
thank
you.
mr.
robert
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
originated
prior
to

by
this

in

and
so
the

was

during
that
entire
time
prior
to
the
bringing
of
the
civil
action,
only
one
case
was
in
fact
brought
to
trial.
that
criminal
case
ended
in
a
hung
jury,
i
think
it
was
4-1
that
are
being
a
5-man

and
ended

mr.
