justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
smith,
i
take
it
you
have
first
to
get
over
the
hurdle
whether
all
of
those
arguments
should
initially
be
addressed
to
the
state
agreements.
whether,
in
other
words,
the
younger
principles
are
to
apply
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
a
situation
like
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
my
question
is,
if
the
district
court
erred
in
not
deciding
the
constitutional
questions
you
raise
because
as
i
understand
it
they
did
not
decide
the
merits,
they
said
no
you
have
to
go
on
younger
principles
and
submit
those
constitutional
claims
to
the
state
tribunals,
did
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
if
we
were
to
say
they
were
wrong
about
that,
would
we
then
reach
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
claims
or
would
we
send
them
back
to
the
district
court
and
say
now
you
decide
the
merits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
latter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
really
the
issue
we
have
to
decide
is
this
case
that
is
here
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
whether
you
opt
to
take
those
constitutional
claims
to
the
state
tribunals
or
you
are
entitled
to
have
him
heard
by
the
district
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
wonder
mr.
smith
what
really
the
considerations
of
federalism
would
underlay
the
younger
line
of
decisions
in
the
criminal
--
cases
of
pending
criminal
proceeding.
and
aren’t
you
really
in
the
position
where
you
have
to
argue
that
in
respect
to
pending
civil
proceedings
considerations
of
federalism
are
not
as
significant
as
they
are
whether
pending
criminal
proceedings.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
secondly
i
suppose,
you’ve
got
to
confront
the
holding
below
that
this
civil
proceeding
is
in
aid
of
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
statutes
--
with
state
criminal
statutes
and
in
that
sense
this
is
not
a
pure
civil
proceeding,
or
sort
of
high
bred
quasi.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that
is
purely
civil?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
moran,
haven’t
you
suggested
that
when
the
district
court
abstains
as
distinguished
from
applying
younger,
the
district
court
ought
not
dismiss,
but
hold
the
case
where
the
substantial
--
here
there
was
dismissal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
wouldn’t
we
suppose
since
the,
i
think
our
case
has
rather
been
explicit
so
that
if
you
are
abstaining,
you
hold
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
far
here,
what
the
district
court
did
here
was
dismiss
on
younger
ground?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
moran,
do
you
think
that’s
accurate
description
of
the
statute
quasi-criminal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
it’s
in
the
--
is
it
a
section
in
the
general
obscenity
statute?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
as
i
understand
it,
it
may
be
pursued
independently
without
reference
to
any
present
or
perspective
criminal
prosecution,
can
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
both.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whatever
relief
you
get
mr.
moran,
i
understand
you
to
say
is
limited
to
injunctive
relief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
moran
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
we
affirm
and
the
federal
claims
are
then
remitted
to
the
state
proceeding
and
there
decided
adversely
to
the
store
whatever
the
name
of
it
is
and
that’s
affirmed
in
the
supreme
court
of
your
state.
then
i
gather
the
only
federal
court
that
can
hear
or
determine
these
federal
claims
would
be
this
court
if
we
grant
review
of
the
georgia
supreme
court.
i
take
it,
it
might
come
up
either
by
appeal
or
on
certiorari.
whereas
if
you
had
succeeded
in
the
criminal
prosecution
and
that
had
been
affirmed
by
your
state
supreme
court,
mr.
speight
could
have
gone
in
the
federal
habeas,
could
he
not
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
the
local
federal
district
court
could
have
disagreed
with
your
state
supreme
court,
is
it
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
you
then
would
have
had
to
come
here
via
through
the
court
of
appeals
and
then
to
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
there
is
that
difference,
isn’t
there
between
a
criminal
prosecution
state
and
a
state
civil
proceeding?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
do
you
think
that
has
any
bearing
on
the
application
of
younger
principles?
or
i
may
add
one
other
thing,
i
don’t
know
that
chapman
decided,
but
i
imagine
there
problems
of
res
judicata
on
the
1983
proceeding
if
the
civil
proceeding
comes
out
adversely
to
the
mr.
speight,
aren’t
there?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
[laughter
attempt]
i
am
getting
at
is
now
we
got
plenty
to
do
up
here
as
probably
could
hear
it
of
late
and
are
we
then
to
take
on
the
ultimate
determination
of
these
federal
claims
from
all
50
states?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
we
have
the
assistance
on
the
criminal
side
at
least
the
lower
federal
courts
in
federal
habeas
but
we
wouldn’t
hear,
would
we?
why
is
it
there
something
like
the
englander
which
was
an
abstention
problem
a
year
ago?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
that’s
just
a
problem
and
more
often
than
not,
we
do
deny
certiorari
for
a
lot
of
different
reasons
and
the
consequence
then
is
that
these
federal
claims
are
never
heard
in
the
federal
forum.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
agree,
but
[laughter
attempt]
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
agree
but
as
mr.
smith
suggested
zwickler
versus
koota
had
something
to
say
about
the
availability
of
the
federal
forum.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
it’s
the
unanimous
decision
of
this
court
and
the
meaning
of
the
1875
amendments
and
so
forth.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
know.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
am
just
--
my
real
question
to
you
is
don’t
you
think
our
determination
whether
or
not
younger
should
be
applied
in
the
civil
area
or
to
take
into
account
that
the
only
federal
forum
available
would
be
this
court?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
where
the
difficulties
of
getting
cert?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
that
that’s
more
in
the
abstention
area
i
suggest
than
the
younger?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
smith,
i
take
it
you
have
first
to
get
over
the

those
arguments
should
initially

whether,
in

apply
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
in
a
situation
like
this.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
my
question
is,
if
the
district
court
erred
in
not
deciding
the
constitutional
questions
you
raise
because
as
i
understand
it
they
did
not
decide
the

they
said
no
you
have
to
go
on
younger
principles
and
submit
those
constitutional
claims
to
the
state
tribunals,
did
they
not?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
now,
if
we
were
to
say
they
were
wrong
about
that,
would
we
then
reach
the
merits
of
the
constitutional
claims
or
would
we
send
them
back
to
the
district
court
and
say
now
you
decide
the
merits?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
latter?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
that
really
the
issue
we
have
to
decide
is
this
case
that
is
here
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--
is
whether
you
opt
to
take
those
constitutional
claims
to
the
state
tribunals
or
you
are
entitled
to
have
him

the

justice
william
j.

i
wonder
mr.

what
really
the
considerations
of
federalism
would
underlay
the
younger
line
of
decisions
in
the
criminal
--
cases
of
pending

proceeding.
and
aren’t
you
really
in
the
position
where
you
have
to
argue
that
in
respect
to
pending
civil
proceedings
considerations
of
federalism
are
not
as
significant
as
they
are
whether
pending
criminal
proceedings.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
secondly
i
suppose,
you’ve
got
to
confront
the
holding
below
that
this
civil

is
in

of
the
enforcement

in

sense
this
is
not
a

or

of
high

justice
william
j.
brennan,

that
is
purely
civil?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
moran,
haven’t
you
suggested
that
when
the
district

the
district

ought
not

but
hold
the

william

and
wouldn’t
we
suppose
since
the,
i
think
our
case
has
rather
been
explicit
so
that
if
you
are
abstaining,
you
hold
case.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
far
here,
what
the
district
court
did
here
was
dismiss
on
younger
ground?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
moran,
do
you
think
that’s
accurate
description
of
the
statute
quasi-criminal?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
gather
it’s
in
the
--
is
it
a
section
in
the
general
obscenity
statute?
justice
william

as
i

yes.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
both.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
whatever
relief
you
get
mr.
moran,
i
understand
you
to
say
is
limited
to
injunctive
relief?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
mr.
moran
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
we
affirm
and
the
federal

are
then
remitted
