mr.
thomas
r.
moran
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
start
with,
i’d
like
to
tell
the
court
that
the
--
as
my
brother
has
told
the
court
that
the
sanders
case
now
before
the
georgia
supreme
court
has
not
been
decided.
it
brought
into
question
george
code
annotated
26-2103
which
is
the
statute
that
was
certfully
attacked
here.
there
are
other
grounds
the
court
may
not
decide
it
on
that
particular
statute,
but
i
thought
the
court
would
be
interested
in
the
ds
before
the
georgia
supreme
court.
now,
in
this
case,
may
it
please
the
court
the
facts
are
not
too
complicated.
we
brought
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
your
honor,
as
far
as
the
briefs
are
concerned,
it
will
bear.
i
read
the
briefs
and
i
know
counsel
in
the
other
side.
there
were
two
issues.
first
of
all
it
was
closed
on
a
nuisance
theory
based
in
part
on
the
statute
and
then
on
a
zoning
statute,
so
the
supreme
court
conceivably
could
go
then
and
leave
this
issue
alone.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
essentially
that
in
august
of
1972,
the
state
brought
a
nuisance
action
some
two
months
after
we
had
a
mistrial
on
a
criminal
case.
nuisance
action
was
brought
against
camden
road
bookstore.
the
criminal
case
was
against
one
man
chandler
who
we
found
out
after
we
brought
the
civil
action
either
lost
its
proprietary
interest
or
something
and
speight
took
over.
now,
we
set
it
down
for
rule
hearing
as
a
normal
georgia
procedure
in
nuisance
cases
that
was
four
days
after
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
on
the
morning
that
we
arrived
for
court
after
the
court
had
cleared
its
calenders
for
a
rule
hearing,
where
we
were
served
with
removal
after
we
announced
strategy.
at
that
time,
we
repaired
to
the
federal
court
on
the
state
court’s
direction
and
we
discussed
the
case,
both
counsel
with
judge
moore
(ph)
who
drew
the
case
when
we
got
over
there,
we
sought
over
for
a
three-judge
panel.
between
the
time
that
we
could
hear
the
removal
action
in
1983
civil
rights
actions
filed
by
appellants
herein,
they
alleged
that
the
georgia
statute
26-2101,
which
is
our
general
obscenity
statute
and
in
that
time
pro
miller,
it
tracked
roth
memoirs
and
it
had
been
declared
constitutional
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
gable
versus
jenkins.
they
attacked
26-2103
which
is
a
nuisance
statute
that
counsel
has
referred
to.
they
attacked
26-2104
which
makes
any
material
which
had
been
found
to
be
obscene,
contraband,
that
is
after
determination,
therefore
we
could
destroy
it
and
they
attacked
the
entire
nuisance
chapters.
now
the
district
court
when
we
went
over
there
did
not
reach
the
merits.
they
decided
the
case
with
abstention,
comity
and
federalism
and
sent
us
back.
that’s
where
we
are
at
the
present
time.
now,
it’s
important
to
note
that
the
rule
then
pending
in
the
first
circuit
as
far
as
abstention
and
comity
and
what
to
do
when
a
injunction
or
declaratory
leave
is
asked
against
the
state
statute,
was
it
federal
intervention
will
not
rest
on
label
such
as
civil
or
criminal?
it’s
simply
balancing
of
the
competing
interests.
the
doctrine
arose
out
of
the
poile
(ph)
chandler
case
and
that’s
what
the
court
did
in
this
case.
they
wanted
the
competing
interest.
they
determined
that
this
was
a
quasi-criminal
case
and
similar
to
poile.
therefore
younger
versus
harris
standard
should
apply,
but
i
also
found
that
this
statute
had
never
been
construed
by
any
state
court.
therefore,
abstention
would
be
proper.
now
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
i
thought
they
say
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
your
honor,
i
think
they’re
both
combined.
i
think
there
was
a
one
sentence
in
the
majority
opinion
that
said
that
in
this
instance
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
in
this
particular
case,
the
state
courts
has
ruled
under
more
of
a
reason
why
we
ought
to
send
it
back.
i
don’t
think
they
went
into
it
in
any
great
depths.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
and
the
statute
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
i
totally
agree,
but
i
think
there
was
some
extension
to
back
up
their
position
that
the
state
courts
have
enacted
here.
i
know
this
1980
--
i
am
sorry,
2284
does
make
us
--
mandate
the
court
to
hold
for
this
time.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
but
this
rule
as
far
we
are
in
competing
interest
and
now
the
rule
in
the
fourth
and
the
seventh
circuits
also.
lynch
versus
snepp
which
is
on
appeal
up
here
use
that
rule
and
so
does
cousins
versus
wigoda.
now,
the
first
circuit
went
one
step
further
when
they
added
the
quasi-criminal
concept
and
read
competing
interest
in
light
of
younger
versus
harris
standards.
now
this
was
left
out
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
oh
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
your
honor
it’s
in
the
criminal
provisions.
it’s
the
next
statute
codified
under
the
obscenity
standard.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
no,
that’s
what
my
understanding
of
the
statute
is,
but
you
have
to
go
back
to
21
--
26-2101
along
the
general
obscenity
statute
and
determine
if
it’s
obscene,
which
is
a
criminal
statute.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
in
other
words,
if
they
find
obscene
material,
we
could
move
in
either
two
ways
at
the
same
time.
we
could
hit
criminally
or
civilly
or
we
could
hit
it
with
both.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
like
kinsley
books
suggested
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
i
think
in
this
instance
it
will
because
we
are
further
in
the
end
with
the
criminal
statute.
it
simply
another
alternative
penalty.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
i
think
to
both.
the
criminal
statute
is
the
general
obscenity
statute.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
now,
the
courts
can
after
jury
trial.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
whether
it
need
be
criminal.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
just
to
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
no
but
if
it
be
in
the
--
this
question
has
come
before.
it
came
in
before
this
court
in
gable
versus
jenkins
which
was
a
position
case
where
he
was
brought
before
the
board
and
he
was
defrauded,
if
you
want
to
use
that
term.
in
that
case,
the
georgia
courts
had
held
that
in
turney
type
procedures
disbarment
proceedings,
the
diversion
cases
that
you
use
some
of
the
criminal
rules
because
it
is
quasi-criminal
nature
because
it’s
filthy.
so
that
does
have
[voice
overlap]
particular
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
there
would
be
into
the
rationale
of
gable
versus
jenkins,
in
our
state
it
would
be.
i
don’t
--
there
are
no
cases
down
in
courtrooms
that
i
know
of
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
it
is.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir
on
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
well,
that
i
--
we
can
put
like
the
state
court
said,
i
mean
the
federal
court
said
(inaudible)
stamp
it,
that’s
it
and
i
think
as
far
as
competing
interest,
what
do
you
do
to
the
state
court
machinery?
when
you
intervene
in
a
case
like
this,
it
is
entirely
different
in
a
civil
case.
it's
just
like
tax
cases,
you
go
in.
the
bureaucratic
system
is
set
up
the
move.
the
court
is
set
up,
the
prosecutors
are
moving,
the
law
is
being
enforced
and
then
you
stop.
i
think
that
was
a
danger
in
interrupting
our
dual
system
to
begin
with.
but
you
do
embarrass
the
state
proceedings.
you
prohibit
as
state
prosecutor
from
going
into
his
own
court
and
finding
out
what
the
law
is
and
then
you
shortcut
the
usual
system
about
your
state
courts
and
other
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
that’s
exactly
what
i
do.
now,
we
don’t
--
this
is
the
third
fact,
we
don’t
really
know
what
the
extent
of
the
remedy
in
the
statute
is
under
nuisance
because
our
general
statute
is
a
bond
type
of
statute
72-301
at
all
when
it
deals
with
house
of
prostitution
and
every
section
refers
back
to
the
initial
section
on
house
of
prostitution
(inaudible)
issue.
so
in
total
supreme
court
rules,
we
don’t
know
whether
--
in
fact
in
my
opinion
under
the
douglas
case
we
couldn’t
go
in
there
and
padlock
it
and
destroy
the
material.
it
had
to
be
only
by
injunction.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
it
could
only
by
injunction.
the
judge
would
have
to
write
--
he
couldn’t
padlock
and
he
couldn’t
destroy
forfeiture.
he’d
have
to
enjoin.
that’s
the
douglas
case
coming
out
of
our
state
so
that
unless
there’s
a
specific
statute
on
it,
you
can’t
forfeit
and
destroy.
here
it’s
only
by
injunction.
you
can’t
close
down
its
business.
it’s
a
superior
garden
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
the
effect
of
injunction
would
probably
be
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
it
could
be
just
telling
you
can’t
sell
anymore
obscene
books.
it
could
be
that
to
tell
him
that
under
--
you’d
have
to
construe
our
georgia
constitution
with
it.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
we
pray
to
seize
all
of
these
books.
no
state
action.
at
this
point,
we
don’t
know,
construing
the
nuisance
statutes
which
had
never
been
construed
in
this
particular
point
whether
we
would
have
gotten
that
relief
or
not.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
in
other
words,
in
effect
to
the
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
under
(inaudible)
as
i
read
it.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
that’s
true.
it
just
says
that
if
you
sort
of
book,
you
are
a
nuisance
and
in
fact,
how
do
we
bait
you
is
not
particularly
clear
at
this
time.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
your
honor.
it
went
into
to
effect
and
it
was
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
not
exactly,
your
honor.
it
never
mentions
it.
we
run
under
the
basic
law
that
say
a
nuisance
is
anything
that
works
toward
any
inconvenience
to
the
public.
and
that’s
--
that
the
attorney
general
or
i
am
sorry,
the
district
attorney
in
each
particular
judicial
district
can
move
that
to
abate
them.
that’s
generally
what
we
move.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir
that’s
the
general
obscenity
statute.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
that’s
the
general
obscenity
statute.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
26-2103
and
72
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
and
72,
i
think
its
201
which
is
the
general
--
gives
the
district
attorney
the
power
to
go
on
abate
nuisance
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir
and
there
were
couple
of
more
general
statutes
and
that
gives
us
the
power
to
go
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
variable.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
your
chapter
3
is
the
one
that
gives
a
forfeiture
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir
that
gives
the
forfeiture
and
abatement
proceedings
in
house
of
prostitution.
you
lock
to
place
[voice
overlap]
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
and
the
rest
of
the
chapter
always
refers
back
to
that
initial
paragraph.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
now,
your
honor,
i
think
the
rule
on
the
fifth
circuit
is
a
good
one.
in
equitable
proceedings
it’s
discretionary
with
the
court
then
we
have
to
have
some
discretion
built
into
your
rule
that
you’re
going
to
use
when
you
determine
whether
to
take
a
case
from
the
state
court
or
you
get
in
the
position
that
this
case
court
found
that’s
left
in
the
mitchum
case
where
it
had
to
construe
younger
versus
harris
and
the
atlantic
coast
line
case.
now,
comity
as
the
court
where
i
know
is
a
judge-made
rule
which
protects
our
dual
system
of
justice.
in
this
case,
most
of
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
was
based
on
comity
and
the
younger
versus
harris
doctrine.
we’ve
come
to
a
point
where
1983
is
express
exception
to
2283
and
the
injunction
statute.
but
in
mitchum,
it’s
clear
that
district
court
has
to
go
farther
than
that
to
determine
that
the
basic
principles
of
equity,
comity,
and
federalism
would
be
violated
by
taking
jurisdiction.
in
this
case,
they
found
that
simply
because
the
state
was
acting.
we
had
a
statute
which
had
not
been
construed
by
the
federal
court
or
by
the
state
courts
authoritatively.
there
had
been
no
state
action
as
yet.
in
other
words,
the
plaintiff
in
the
lower
court
below
comes
in
and
says,
“he
has
filed
a
complaint
against
me.”
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
it
did
but
i
mean
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
i
am
sorry
sir,
i
slipped
with
the
terms.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
but
in
other
words,
the
state
court
had
not
acted
yet.
we
don’t
know
exactly
what
is
irreparable
injury
may
be
if
there
is
any.
and
when
he
comes
it,
when
he
files
the
action
he
has
rules
so
he
has
an
adversary
hearing
before
anything
is
picked
up,
nothing
is
seized.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
he
ran
out
and
bought
on
three
different
occasions
alleged
that
this
is
representative
of
everything
in
store
that
every
one
in
that
store
is
either
absolute
or
so
commingled
with
other
things
that
are
not
obscene
is
to
make
them
indistinguishable.
the
judge
would
issue
an
interlocutory
order
and
within
60
days,
we
have
to
go
to
trial
before
a
jury.
that’s
the
procedure
we
are
moving
on.
now,
the
procedure
grew
out
of
three
basis,
those
are
--
which
this
court
had,
poile,
walter
versus
slaton.
these
were
all
adversary
hearing
procedures
around
1969
where
our
courts,
we
didn’t
have
any
procedure
for
adversary
hearings
and
our
court
said
they
were
all
nuisances
and
we
based
the
statute
on
that
in
past.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
?yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
it
could
be.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
right.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
but
then
he
doesn’t
run
the
forth
the
problem
of
going
to
jail
that’s
what
we
have.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
well,
you
have
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
no,
sir
but
they
are
in
the
state
forum
and
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
--
the
state
have
to
do
with
[voice
overlap]
this
court
in
federal
court.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
but
there
was
no
appendix
in
state
court
action.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
that’s
another.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir
it
should
well
only
interest.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
it
should
well
only
interest
in
it.
i
think
it
has
to
be
with
case
by
case
basis
just
as
this
one
is.
because
especially
if
--
i
am
trying
to
think
of
the
justice
who
said
it,
but
the
wisconsin
case,
when
the
statute
comes
to
a
federal
court
to
be
adjudicated
is
naked
in
essence.
it
has
no
construction
applied
if
it
had
not
been
construed
and
they
can’t
construe
a
state
statute
so
it
either
stands
or
falls
in
its
face.
and
i
doubt
if
they
could
construe
in
light
of
other
revisions.
i
think
we
have
constitutional
provision.
you’d
have
to
construe
the
statute
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir
but
i
think
that
would
bear
in
whether
to
apply
younger
versus
harris
standards
just
as
the
habeas
corpus
would
bear
on
it.
you
got
to
have
to
weigh
all
the
competing
interests
not
just
one
of
them.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
no,
sir.
that’s
true
that’s
what
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
nuisance.
i
think
what
it
means
when
it
makes
it
a
nuisance.
how
to
abate
it?
you
could
have
to
construe
it.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
not
on
this
particular
statute,
no,
sir.
there
decisions
about
beer
houses
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
quite
a
few.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
there
are
quite
a
few
and
how
to
abate.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
no,
sir
it
makes
it
a
nuisance.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
i
don’t
--
i
think
what
is
vague
is
not
the
statute
on
its
face,
but
the
remedy
the
statute
provides
in
the
state.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
but
how
the
statute
--
how
the
nuisance
seems
to
be
abated
after
you
determine
it's
a
nuisance.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
the
statute
says,
“use
of
any
premises
in
violation
of
any
provisions
of
this
chapter,
that’s
the
general
obscenity
statute,
shall
constitute
a
public
nuisance.”
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
no,
sir.
not
on
the
statute
face.
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
vagueness.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
and
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
i
want
the
georgia
supreme
court
to
interpret
it.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
no.
yes,
sir
on
its
face,
there
is
nothing
but
as
applied
it
could
be.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
as
applied.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
no,
sir
not
vague
on
its
face.
in
the
first
amendment
area
though,
you
still
have
to
apply
the
doctrines
of
the
abstention
and
comity.
i
know
when
the
state
court
comes
in
and
says
and
we
come
into
a
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
i
have
one
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes.
there
is
no
prior
restraint
without
judicial
action,
but
it
could
be
prior
restraint,
yes
sir.
that’s
what
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
or
in
the
future,
it’s
interpreted
that
way.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
there
is
--
no,
sir
except
in
mitchum
versus
foster.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
no,
the
issue
was
whether
to
it
bars
on
its
face.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
you
mean
the
same
background.
he
did
say
we
have
to
go
into
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
unless
there
are
any
questions,
i
think
i’ll
leave
the
rest
of
the
time.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
to
start
with,
i’d
like
to
tell
the
court
that
the
--
as
my
brother
has
told
the
court
that
the
sanders
case
now
before
the
georgia
supreme
court
has
not
been
decided.
it
brought
into
question
george
code
annotated
26-2103
which
is
the
statute
that
was
certfully
attacked
here.
there
are
other
grounds
the
court
may
not
decide
it
on
that
particular
statute,
but
i
thought
the
court
would
be
interested
in
the
ds
before
the
georgia
supreme
court.
now,
in
this
case,
may
it
please
the
court
the
facts
are
not
too
complicated.
we
brought
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
your
honor,
as
far
as
the
briefs
are
concerned,
it
will
bear.
i
read
the
briefs
and
i
know
counsel
in
the
other
side.
there
were
two
issues.
first
of
all
it
was
closed
on
a
nuisance
theory
based
in
part
on
the
statute
and
then
on
a
zoning
statute,
so
the
supreme
court
conceivably
could
go
then
and
leave
this
issue
alone.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
your
honor,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
essentially
that
in
august
of
1972,
the
state
brought
a
nuisance
action
some
two
months
after
we
had
a
mistrial
on
a
criminal
case.
nuisance
action
was
brought
against
camden
road
bookstore.
the
criminal
case
was
against
one
man
chandler
who
we
found
out
after
we
brought
the
civil
action
either
lost
its
proprietary
interest
or
something
and
speight
took
over.
now,
we
set
it
down
for
rule
hearing
as
a
normal
georgia
procedure
in
nuisance
cases
that
was
four
days
after
the
filing
of
the
complaint.
on
the
morning
that
we
arrived
for
court
after
the
court
had
cleared
its
calenders
for
a
rule
hearing,
where
we
were
served
with
removal
after
we
announced
strategy.
at
that
time,
we
repaired
to
the
federal
court
on
the
state
court’s
direction
and
we
discussed
the
case,
both
counsel
with
judge
moore
(ph)
who
drew
the
case
when
we
got
over
there,
we
sought
over
for
a
three-judge
panel.
between
the
time
that
we
could
hear
the
removal
action
in
1983
civil
rights
actions
filed
by
appellants
herein,
they
alleged
that
the
georgia
statute
26-2101,
which
is
our
general
obscenity
statute
and
in
that
time
pro
miller,
it
tracked
roth
memoirs
and
it
had
been
declared
constitutional
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
was
affirmed
by
this
court
in
gable
versus
jenkins.
they
attacked
26-2103
which
is
a
nuisance
statute
that
counsel
has
referred
to.
they
attacked
26-2104
which
makes
any
material
which
had
been
found
to
be
obscene,
contraband,
that
is
after
determination,
therefore
we
could
destroy
it
and
they
attacked
the
entire
nuisance
chapters.
now
the
district
court
when
we
went
over
there
did
not
reach
the
merits.
they
decided
the
case
with
abstention,
comity
and
federalism
and
sent
us
back.
that’s
where
we
are
at
the
present
time.
now,
it’s
important
to
note
that
the
rule
then
pending
in
the
first
circuit
as
far
as
abstention
and
comity
and
what
to
do
when
a
injunction
or
declaratory
leave
is
asked
against
the
state
statute,
was
it
federal
intervention
will
not
rest
on
label
such
as
civil
or
criminal?
it’s
simply
balancing
of
the
competing
interests.
the
doctrine
arose
out
of
the
poile
(ph)
chandler
case
and
that’s
what
the
court
did
in
this
case.
they
wanted
the
competing
interest.
they
determined
that
this
was
a
quasi-criminal
case
and
similar
to
poile.
therefore
younger
versus
harris
standard
should
apply,
but
i
also
found
that
this
statute
had
never
been
construed
by
any
state
court.
therefore,
abstention
would
be
proper.
now
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
i
thought
they
say
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
your
honor,
i
think
they’re
both
combined.
i
think
there
was
a
one
sentence
in
the
majority
opinion
that
said
that
in
this
instance
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
in
this
particular
case,
the
state
courts
has
ruled
under
more
of
a
reason
why
we
ought
to
send
it
back.
i
don’t
think
they
went
into
it
in
any
great
depths.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
i
think
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
and
the
statute
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
i
totally
agree,
but
i
think
there
was
some
extension
to
back
up
their
position
that
the
state
courts
have
enacted
here.
i
know
this
1980
--
i
am
sorry,
2284
does
make
us
--
mandate
the
court
to
hold
for
this
time.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
but
this
rule
as
far
we
are
in
competing
interest
and
now
the
rule
in
the
fourth
and
the
seventh
circuits
also.
lynch
versus
snepp
which
is
on
appeal
up
here
use
that
rule
and
so
does
cousins
versus
wigoda.
now,
the
first
circuit
went
one
step
further
when
they
added
the
quasi-criminal
concept
and
read
competing
interest
in
light
of
younger
versus
harris
standards.
now
this
was
left
out
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
oh
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
your
honor
it’s
in
the
criminal
provisions.
it’s
the
next
statute
codified
under
the
obscenity
standard.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
no,
that’s
what
my
understanding
of
the
statute
is,
but
you
have
to
go
back
to
21
--
26-2101
along
the
general
obscenity
statute
and
determine
if
it’s
obscene,
which
is
a
criminal
statute.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
in
other
words,
if
they
find
obscene
material,
we
could
move
in
either
two
ways
at
the
same
time.
we
could
hit
criminally
or
civilly
or
we
could
hit
it
with
both.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
like
kinsley
books
suggested
your
honor.
now
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
i
think
in
this
instance
it
will
because
we
are
further
in
the
end
with
the
criminal
statute.
it
simply
another
alternative
penalty.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
i
think
to
both.
the
criminal
statute
is
the
general
obscenity
statute.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
now,
the
courts
can
after
jury
trial.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
whether
it
need
be
criminal.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
just
to
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
no
but
if
it
be
in
the
--
this
question
has
come
before.
it
came
in
before
this
court
in
gable
versus
jenkins
which
was
a
position
case
where
he
was
brought
before
the
board
and
he
was
defrauded,
if
you
want
to
use
that
term.
in
that
case,
the
georgia
courts
had
held
that
in
turney
type
procedures
disbarment
proceedings,
the
diversion
cases
that
you
use
some
of
the
criminal
rules
because
it
is
quasi-criminal
nature
because
it’s
filthy.
so
that
does
have
[voice
overlap]
particular
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
there
would
be
into
the
rationale
of
gable
versus
jenkins,
in
our
state
it
would
be.
i
don’t
--
there
are
no
cases
down
in
courtrooms
that
i
know
of
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
it
is.
yes
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir
on
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
well,
that
i
--
we
can
put
like
the
state
court
said,
i
mean
the
federal
court
said
(inaudible)
stamp
it,
that’s
it
and
i
think
as
far
as
competing
interest,
what
do
you
do
to
the
state
court
machinery?
when
you
intervene
in
a
case
like
this,
it
is
entirely
different
in
a
civil
case.
it's
just
like
tax
cases,
you
go
in.
the
bureaucratic
system
is
set
up
the
move.
the
court
is
set
up,
the
prosecutors
are
moving,
the
law
is
being
enforced
and
then
you
stop.
i
think
that
was
a
danger
in
interrupting
our
dual
system
to
begin
with.
but
you
do
embarrass
the
state
proceedings.
you
prohibit
as
state
prosecutor
from
going
into
his
own
court
and
finding
out
what
the
law
is
and
then
you
shortcut
the
usual
system
about
your
state
courts
and
other
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
that’s
exactly
what
i
do.
now,
we
don’t
--
this
is
the
third
fact,
we
don’t
really
know
what
the
extent
of
the
remedy
in
the
statute
is
under
nuisance
because
our
general
statute
is
a
bond
type
of
statute
72-301
at
all
when
it
deals
with
house
of
prostitution
and
every
section
refers
back
to
the
initial
section
on
house
of
prostitution
(inaudible)
issue.
so
in
total
supreme
court
rules,
we
don’t
know
whether
--
in
fact
in
my
opinion
under
the
douglas
case
we
couldn’t
go
in
there
and
padlock
it
and
destroy
the
material.
it
had
to
be
only
by
injunction.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
it
could
only
by
injunction.
the
judge
would
have
to
write
--
he
couldn’t
padlock
and
he
couldn’t
destroy
forfeiture.
he’d
have
to
enjoin.
that’s
the
douglas
case
coming
out
of
our
state
so
that
unless
there’s
a
specific
statute
on
it,
you
can’t
forfeit
and
destroy.
here
it’s
only
by
injunction.
you
can’t
close
down
its
business.
it’s
a
superior
garden
case.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
the
effect
of
injunction
would
probably
be
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
it
could
be
just
telling
you
can’t
sell
anymore
obscene
books.
it
could
be
that
to
tell
him
that
under
--
you’d
have
to
construe
our
georgia
constitution
with
it.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
we
pray
to
seize
all
of
these
books.
no
state
action.
at
this
point,
we
don’t
know,
construing
the
nuisance
statutes
which
had
never
been
construed
in
this
particular
point
whether
we
would
have
gotten
that
relief
or
not.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
in
other
words,
in
effect
to
the
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
under
(inaudible)
as
i
read
it.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
that’s
true.
it
just
says
that
if
you
sort
of
book,
you
are
a
nuisance
and
in
fact,
how
do
we
bait
you
is
not
particularly
clear
at
this
time.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
your
honor.
it
went
into
to
effect
and
it
was
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
not
exactly,
your
honor.
it
never
mentions
it.
we
run
under
the
basic
law
that
say
a
nuisance
is
anything
that
works
toward
any
inconvenience
to
the
public.
and
that’s
--
that
the
attorney
general
or
i
am
sorry,
the
district
attorney
in
each
particular
judicial
district
can
move
that
to
abate
them.
that’s
generally
what
we
move.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir
that’s
the
general
obscenity
statute.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
that’s
the
general
obscenity
statute.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
26-2103
and
72
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
and
72,
i
think
its
201
which
is
the
general
--
gives
the
district
attorney
the
power
to
go
on
abate
nuisance
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir
and
there
were
couple
of
more
general
statutes
and
that
gives
us
the
power
to
go
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
variable.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
your
chapter
3
is
the
one
that
gives
a
forfeiture
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir
that
gives
the
forfeiture
and
abatement
proceedings
in
house
of
prostitution.
you
lock
to
place
[voice
overlap]
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
and
the
rest
of
the
chapter
always
refers
back
to
that
initial
paragraph.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
now,
your
honor,
i
think
the
rule
on
the
fifth
circuit
is
a
good
one.
in
equitable
proceedings
it’s
discretionary
with
the
court
then
we
have
to
have
some
discretion
built
into
your
rule
that
you’re
going
to
use
when
you
determine
whether
to
take
a
case
from
the
state
court
or
you
get
in
the
position
that
this
case
court
found
that’s
left
in
the
mitchum
case
where
it
had
to
construe
younger
versus
harris
and
the
atlantic
coast
line
case.
now,
comity
as
the
court
where
i
know
is
a
judge-made
rule
which
protects
our
dual
system
of
justice.
in
this
case,
most
of
the
decision
of
the
lower
court
was
based
on
comity
and
the
younger
versus
harris
doctrine.
we’ve
come
to
a
point
where
1983
is
express
exception
to
2283
and
the
injunction
statute.
but
in
mitchum,
it’s
clear
that
district
court
has
to
go
farther
than
that
to
determine
that
the
basic
principles
of
equity,
comity,
and
federalism
would
be
violated
by
taking
jurisdiction.
in
this
case,
they
found
that
simply
because
the
state
was
acting.
we
had
a
statute
which
had
not
been
construed
by
the
federal
court
or
by
the
state
courts
authoritatively.
there
had
been
no
state
action
as
yet.
in
other
words,
the
plaintiff
in
the
lower
court
below
comes
in
and
says,
“he
has
filed
a
complaint
against
me.”
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
it
did
but
i
mean
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
i
am
sorry
sir,
i
slipped
with
the
terms.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
but
in
other
words,
the
state
court
had
not
acted
yet.
we
don’t
know
exactly
what
is
irreparable
injury
may
be
if
there
is
any.
and
when
he
comes
it,
when
he
files
the
action
he
has
rules
so
he
has
an
adversary
hearing
before
anything
is
picked
up,
nothing
is
seized.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
he
ran
out
and
bought
on
three
different
occasions
alleged
that
this
is
representative
of
everything
in
store
that
every
one
in
that
store
is
either
absolute
or
so
commingled
with
other
things
that
are
not
obscene
is
to
make
them
indistinguishable.
the
judge
would
issue
an
interlocutory
order
and
within
60
days,
we
have
to
go
to
trial
before
a
jury.
that’s
the
procedure
we
are
moving
on.
now,
the
procedure
grew
out
of
three
basis,
those
are
--
which
this
court
had,
poile,
walter
versus
slaton.
these
were
all
adversary
hearing
procedures
around
1969
where
our
courts,
we
didn’t
have
any
procedure
for
adversary
hearings
and
our
court
said
they
were
all
nuisances
and
we
based
the
statute
on
that
in
past.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
?yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
it
could
be.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
right.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
but
then
he
doesn’t
run
the
forth
the
problem
of
going
to
jail
that’s
what
we
have.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
well,
you
have
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
no,
sir
but
they
are
in
the
state
forum
and
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
--
the
state
have
to
do
with
[voice
overlap]
this
court
in
federal
court.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
but
there
was
no
appendix
in
state
court
action.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
that’s
another.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir
it
should
well
only
interest.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
it
should
well
only
interest
in
it.
i
think
it
has
to
be
with
case
by
case
basis
just
as
this
one
is.
because
especially
if
--
i
am
trying
to
think
of
the
justice
who
said
it,
but
the
wisconsin
case,
when
the
statute
comes
to
a
federal
court
to
be
adjudicated
is
naked
in
essence.
it
has
no
construction
applied
if
it
had
not
been
construed
and
they
can’t
construe
a
state
statute
so
it
either
stands
or
falls
in
its
face.
and
i
doubt
if
they
could
construe
in
light
of
other
revisions.
i
think
we
have
constitutional
provision.
you’d
have
to
construe
the
statute
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir
but
i
think
that
would
bear
in
whether
to
apply
younger
versus
harris
standards
just
as
the
habeas
corpus
would
bear
on
it.
you
got
to
have
to
weigh
all
the
competing
interests
not
just
one
of
them.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
no,
sir.
that’s
true
that’s
what
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
nuisance.
i
think
what
it
means
when
it
makes
it
a
nuisance.
how
to
abate
it?
you
could
have
to
construe
it.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
not
on
this
particular
statute,
no,
sir.
there
decisions
about
beer
houses
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
quite
a
few.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
there
are
quite
a
few
and
how
to
abate.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
no,
sir
it
makes
it
a
nuisance.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
i
don’t
--
i
think
what
is
vague
is
not
the
statute
on
its
face,
but
the
remedy
the
statute
provides
in
the
state.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
but
how
the
statute
--
how
the
nuisance
seems
to
be
abated
after
you
determine
it's
a
nuisance.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
the
statute
says,
“use
of
any
premises
in
violation
of
any
provisions
of
this
chapter,
that’s
the
general
obscenity
statute,
shall
constitute
a
public
nuisance.”
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
no,
sir.
not
on
the
statute
face.
i
don’t
think
there’s
any
vagueness.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
and
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
i
want
the
georgia
supreme
court
to
interpret
it.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
no.
yes,
sir
on
its
face,
there
is
nothing
but
as
applied
it
could
be.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
as
applied.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
no,
sir
not
vague
on
its
face.
in
the
first
amendment
area
though,
you
still
have
to
apply
the
doctrines
of
the
abstention
and
comity.
i
know
when
the
state
court
comes
in
and
says
and
we
come
into
a
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
i
beg
your
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
i
have
one
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes.
there
is
no
prior
restraint
without
judicial
action,
but
it
could
be
prior
restraint,
yes
sir.
that’s
what
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
yes,
sir.
or
in
the
future,
it’s
interpreted
that
way.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
there
is
--
no,
sir
except
in
mitchum
versus
foster.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
no,
the
issue
was
whether
to
it
bars
on
its
face.
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
you
mean
the
same
background.
he
did
say
we
have
to
go
into
--
mr.
thomas
r.
moran
unless
there
are
any
questions,
i
think
i’ll
leave
the
rest
of
the
time.
