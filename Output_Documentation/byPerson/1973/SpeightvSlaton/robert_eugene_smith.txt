mr.
robert
eugene
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
i
think
we
left
off
with
the
court
addressing
the
question
about
or
comment
to
the
extent
that
this
court
has
from
time
to
time
allowed
the
state
supreme
court
of
the
states
so
we
can
give
a
say
in
its
construction
to
its
statute.
we
suggest
of
course
in
this
instance
we
think
that
the
concept
of
the
circuit
judge
morgan
was
correct
that
this
statute
is
sort
of
straightforward.
it
says
that
any
place
that
sells
an
alleged
obscene
publication
by
the
definition
of
the
criminal
law,
that’s
using
the
criminal
law
definition,
is
declared
to
be
and
shall
be
a
public
nuisance.
hence,
the
activity
is
clear
that
what
they
can
do
is
one
publication
offered
for
sale
could
in
fact,
if
it’s
declared
to
be
obscene,
justify
the
closing
the
entire
premises.
that’s
what
the
statute
says.
that’s
what
the
statute
gives
them
authority
to
do.
now,
certainly
we
have
a
question
of
who
won
the
race
to
the
courthouse
door.
well,
obviously,
in
this
context,
we
didn’t
know
and
couldn’t
know
what’s
in
the
mind
of
the
prosecutor.
he
files
a
civil
action
in
the
state
court.
we
of
course,
move
right
into
federal
court
taking
and
trying
to
have
an
election
of
the
jurisdictional
forum
in
which
we
seek
to
litigate
our
rights
and
if
we
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
sir,
they
have
not
generally
done
so.
there
are
some
states
of
course
which
i
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
have
done
so
but
they
are
statutory
weren't
like
the
statute
at
bar
here.
the
new
riviera
arts
theater
case
was
--
didn’t
have
such
a
statute
in
their
jurisprudence,
hence,
we
have
one
here.
there
was
such
a
statute
as
we
indicated
yesterday
in
the
matter
of
presume
limited
which
the
state
court
construed
to
authorize
the
entire
shuttering
of
the
process
and
of
course
that’s
what
is
here.
we
don’t
have
a
statute
saying
that
the
sale
of
that
article
would
be
a
public
nuisance.
this
court
addressed
itself
to
the
question
in
paris
adult
theater
of
whether
or
not
a
procedure
could
be
employed
whereby
a
film
or
a
book
or
anything
which
might
be
declared
to
be
obscene
in
civil
proceeding
could
not
further
be
shown
and
that’s
of
course
now
the
law.
but
here
they
are
going
on
a
broader
attack
saying
we’re
going
to
shut
the
entire
premises
because
of
the
one
thing.
now,
if
the
court’s
language
in
heller
and
roaden
has
significance
in
quoting
bantam
books
and
such
that
any
law
that
necessary
involves
a
prior
restraint,
comes
to
this
court
bearing
a
heavy
presumption
against
its
validity
and
we’re
talking
about
that
kind
of
law
in
the
context
of
this
case.
as
i
said
and
it’s
the
extreme
to
which
the
law
certainly
can
be
applied
that
is
obvious
and
patently
apparent.
as
i
said
before,
if
a
department
store
which
might
offer
for
sale
the
book
of
joy
of
sex,
if
it
prosecuted
one
or
two
week
ago
it
didn’t
say,
okay
they
sold
this
book,
hence
the
department
store
could
be
closed
and
everything
there
can
be
seized
as
contraband
and
destroyed.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
if
it
found
just
one
item
obscene,
then
everything
will
be
declared.
this
is
not
a
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
unless
they
ultimately
gave
it
a
narrowing
construction.
but
then
the
plain
factual
--
i
mean
the
thing
on
its
face
absolutely
says
that
the
premises
shall
be
constituted
on
public
nuisance.
it
isn’t
the
publication,
it
would
be
nuisance,
it’s
the
use
of
the
premises
would
be
a
public
nuisance.
if
it’s
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
of
course
we
have
taken
the
younger
case
and
this
court
has
said
that
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
that
the
concepts
of
comity
and
federalism
and
such
would
apply
and
that
certainly
that
is
the
law
as
of
today.
this
court
left
open
as
the
comments
of
the
various
writers
of
the
opinion
made
clear
that
in
a
civil
case,
they
would
post
to
you
--
would
postpone
the
reaching
of
that
question
and
of
course
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir
that’s
clear.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
think
that’s
what
we’re
probably
have
to
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that’s
correct
and
of
course
the
dramatic
presentation
or
argument
regarding
the
closing
of
an
entire
store
is
only
made
of
course
apparent
to
show
that
this
is
a
matter
of
prior
restraint
obviously
and
that
this
is
the
way
the
state
is
going
about
it
and
the
factual
situation
here.
if
we
have
to
take
the
issue
that
in
criminal
cases,
the
criminal
cases
started,
we
cannot
have
any
federal
court
intervention.
we
said,
“okay
that’s
one
theory,
that’s
one
rational
of
law,”
then
say
now
in
civil
cases,
it
can
apply
out
of
there,
then
we
really
don’t
have
anything
left
and
the
civil
rights
act
would
almost
be
meaningless.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
i
am
saying
that
the
civil
rights
act,
the
statute
of
congress
would
be
almost
meaningless
then
if
we
were
to
be
foreclosed
the
right
to
go
into
a
federal
court
when
a
civil
matter
has
been
presented.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
but
in
the
context
of
the
case
like
this
if
we
were
first
to
file
before
there
was
any
action
on
the
part
of
the
state
then
we’d
be
faced
with
the
problem,
is
there
a
case
in
controversy.
and
if
there’s
no
case
in
controversy,
can
we
in
fact
go
in
and
seek
a
declaratory
judgment.
so
then
what
good
is
it
to
have
zwickler
versus
koota
that
says
that
we
have
an
election
of
forums
or
that
election
of
forums
to
litigate
federal
constitutional
rights
should
be
allowed?
so
we
are
saying
that
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
in
civil
cases
already
commenced
where
of
course
of
prosecution
knows
what
it's
going
to
do
in
advance
that
we
are
foreclosed
from
going
to
federal
court
to
litigate
our
federal
constitutional
rights
then
i
am
saying
statute
of
congress
that
permits
injunctive
relief
would
almost
be
meaningless
or
at
least
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
but
i
think
this
court
answered
the
questions
there
with
regard
to
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
and
then
you
have
of
course
the
--
that
is
true
except
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
agree,
but
we
take
the
position
of
course
that
it
is
not
an
aid
in
the
enforcement
of
criminal
law.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it’s
purely
civil,
your
honors
because
you
do
not
have
the
seizure
of
film
to
use
in
a
criminal
case.
none
of
this
material
needed
to
be
seized
to
be
used
in
any
of
the
criminal
cases.
it’s
just
a
shuttering
of
the
premises
because
something
was
alleged
to
be
obscene
and
of
course
we’re
being
deprived
of
the
criminal
burden
of
proof
by
the
proceedings
because
it’s
a
single
judge
deciding
whether
or
not
he
thinks
an
item
in
there
was
obscene.
and
if
he
thinks
an
item
was
obscene,
the
entire
place
is
shuttered
and
we
say
that
that
makes
a
significant
difference
and
federalism
should
not
be
the
bar
to
us
seeking
our
belief
in
the
federal
court
in
this
regard.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
but
then
again
we
wouldn’t
have
the
concept
of
the
potential
of
the
irreparable
harm.
the
irreparable
harm
being
the
potential
for
self-censorship,
the
potential
for
chilling
of
speech.
one
year
he
had
--
if
he’s
had
a
business
and
he
sold
the
publication
which
might
be
held
by
one
judge
to
be
obscene
somewhere
and
that
the
entire
business
could
be
shuttered
then
there
would
be
a
chilling
of
speech
which
of
course
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
then
we’d
have
all
the
attended
protection
that
a
criminal
case
would
afford
a
litigant
that
is
not
present
necessarily
in
the
civil
case.
whether
it’s
the
burden
of
proof,
the
right
of
juries,
things
of
this
nature.
so
we
say
that
this
isn’t
necessarily
the
same.
so
at
least
in
a
jury
case
where
it
is
applicable
in
a
criminal
case,
you
--
if
a
community
standard
as
this
court
has
indicated
is
to
be
determined
whether
it’s
local
or
statewide
at
least
the
court
has
said
the
jury
is
the
representative
of
the
community
and
can
make
that
determination.
you
don’t
have
that
with
a
judge
who
may
necessarily
justify
in
one
publication
may
offend
him
subjectively
and
he
--
or
otherwise
in
applying
the
test
of
law,
he
might
find
it
obscene
and
then
says
okay,
fine.
one
publication
we
will
shutter
the
entire
premises.
so
i
think
it’s
different.
the
criminal
case
is
--
you
can,
if
there’s
a
single
criminal
case
now
i
think
what
this
court
is
said
is,
if
there
is
a
single
criminal
case
you
can
defend
your
position
in
that
case.
however,
suppose
the
government
brought
multiple
cases
all
across
the
country
relating
to
the
same
old
type
of
activity
to
the
same
parties,
it
might
be
that
if
the
defendant
in
that
situation
could
say
that
he
thinks
the
government
is
engaging
in
bad
faith
enforcing
the
law
or
harassment
that
he
could
go
forward.
but
here
we
have
as
i
said
a
shuttering;
it’s
completely
independent
of
the
criminal
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
sir
because
they’re
asking
to
destroy
everything.
there
is
no
question
or
contention.
there
is
no
request
that
the
material
be
delivered
up
to
the
sheriff
and/or
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
for
potential
use
in
the
criminal
case
as
there
was
in
the
paris
adult
theater
concept
or
walter’s,
there’s
a
walter’s
case
there
where
that
concept
has
been
held
or
in
the
palaio
versus
mcauliffe
case
which
was
the
rationale
of
the
fifth
circuit
that
the
two
judges
in
this
court
in
the
case
here
bottomed
themselves
on,
so
we'd
say
no
sir
we
don’t
feel
that
there
are.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
the
original
case
was
removed.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
think
it
was
remanded
back
after
the
judges
decided
that
they
had
decided
to
abstain
or
in
essence
settled
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
sir.
it
has
not.
it
has
not
as
of
yesterday
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
and
of
course,
i
think
there’s
circumstances
even
developed
after
this
case
had
started
that
litigation
was
independent
and
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
irreparable.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
right,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
that
is
an
alternative
argument
we
have
made.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir
and
of
course
the
court
did
not
reach
that
issue
because
of
the
way
they
disposed
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir
that’s
right
and
that’s
one
of
the
things
we
had
hoped
to
demonstrate
and
tried
to
demonstrate
in
the
court
below.
so,
in
summary
as
i
said,
our
position
is
that
younger
should
not
apply
these
civil
cases.
this
court
has
before
it
lynch
versus
snepp
in
which
no
action
has
been
taken
and
i
think
it
was
relied
upon
by
counsel
in
our
case
here
in
the
brief.
we
say
that
this
is
a
kind
of
situation
that
if
this
court
takes
the
language
that
any
statute
that
involves
itself
a
prior
restraint
bears
a
heavy
presumption
against
its
constitutional
validity,
this
is
the
kind
of
case
that
should
have
allowed
the
determination.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
i
think,
particularly
it
should
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
we
don’t.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
or
punish
the
criminal
law
to
finish
it
for
the
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
but
then
a
lot
of
this
cases,
your
honor
if
it’s
a
civil
case
involving
litigants,
private
litigants
who
are
not
state
officials
or
state
action
then
we
lose
some
of
the
rights
under
our
civil
rights
act
there
because
there
must
be
certainly
some
color
under
color
statements
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
likewise,
of
course
younger
is
now
seemingly
saying
that
it
always
--
it
almost
always
applies
to
criminal
actions
and
of
course
i
was
making
the
other
simplification
with
regard
to
civil
actions.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
and
that
was
merely
the
purpose.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
sir.
i
don’t
think
so.
this
court,
in
the
opinion
of
the
chief
justice
indicated
that
material
is
not
contraband
until
such
time
as
there
has
been
a
judicial
determination
or
at
least
an
adversary
hearing
of
some
type
after
the
seizure
or
before
the
seizure
in
a
civil
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
but
i
think
this
court
said
in
the
heller-roaden
series
of
cases
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
civil
forfeiture
that
perhaps
quantity
both
[voice
overlap]
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
now,
of
course,
it
is
designed
as
to
protect
public
from
the
material
going
out
into
the
public
and
injurious
to
their
health
and
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
they
are
simply
saying
that
if
you
sell
--
well,
of
course
we
don’t
know
what
the
legislative
theory
is
in
passing
the
legislation
except
just
to
close
the
place
down.
it
could
be
conceivably
said
to
be
that
they
feel
that
they
should
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
but
you
take
the
situation
of
the
drive-in
theater
that
this
court
dealt
with
in
raab
versus
state
of
washington
where
there
was
out
in
the
open
and
it
was
a
constant
repetitive
kind
of
thing.
well,
okay
that
may
have
first
amendment
implications,
but
then
again
had
they
brought
an
nuisance
action
because
of
the
continual
showing
of
the
kind
of
material
that
people
were
having
it
thrust
upon
them
and
i
think
they
are
in
that
kind
of
area.
the
state
may
have
had
the
interest
that
would
have
justified
perhaps
going
forward.
but
we
say
this
is
not
that
kind
of
interest.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
incidentally,
there
was
some
discussion
about
sanders
and
i
wanted
to
tell
the
court
that
as
counsel
was
alluding
to,
there
was
a
zoning
problem
in
sanders
and
that
is
to
say
that
the
city
council
or
the
county
council
of
the
dekalb
county
said
that
no
adult
bookstores
or
theaters
could
be
within
200
yards
of
a
church,
a
school,
a
pool
hall
and
things
like
that.
so,
it’s
very
conceivable
in
view
of
that
absolute
concept
that
sanders
could
be
decided
on
that
issue
and
not
reach
the
nuisance
issue.
it
was
not
declared
to
be
a
nuisance.
it
just
says
a
matter
of
zoning.
no
adult
theater
or
bookstore
can
be
placed
within
so
many
hundred
yards
of
these
various
facilities.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
it’s
not
a
nuisance
sir.
it
just
can’t
have
a
license
and
if
it
you
can’t
have
license
here
and
its
zone,
you’re
not
just
allowed
to
be
operating
here,
right
sir.
and
in
--
further,
under
the
georgia
provisions,
the
determination
of
the
place
of
being
as
a
nuisance
does
not
entitle
us
to
an
automatic
right
of
the
supersedeas
bond.
in
fact,
in
sanders,
i
think
he
was
closed
approximately
three
weeks
before
the
state
judge
gave
him
a
$50,000.00
supersedeas
bond
to
operate
and
finally
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
he
is
open
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
he’s
been
open
because
there’s
been
no
further
action
by
the
state
court
i
suppose
pending
the
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
if
federal
court.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
sir,
no
stay
has
been
granted.
none
was
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
and
in
this
instance
as
we
pointed
out
just
to
be
sure
that
the
court
understands.
if
the
jury
finds
any
of
the
publications
brought
by
the
prosecutions
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
as
to
the
issue
of
the
obscenity
of
the
publication.
then
the
judge
will
apply
the
law
as
it
is
written
obliviously
and
shutter
the
premises.
so
the
jury
would
not
determine
whether
it
was
a
nuisance,
the
jury
would
determine
whether
the
material
was
obscene
under
the
standards
this
court
has
set
forth.
and
incidentally,
as
the
court
mentioned
in
mitchum
which
is
the
case
that
we
argued
before
the
court
sometime
ago,
the
mitchum
case
is
now
being
held
by
the
district
court
judge
waiting
a
decision
in
this
case.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
first
of
all,
i
think
we
left
off
with
the
court
addressing
the
question
about
or
comment
to
the
extent
that
this
court
has
from
time
to
time
allowed
the
state
supreme
court
of
the
states
so
we
can
give
a
say
in
its
construction
to
its
statute.
we
suggest
of
course
in
this
instance
we
think
that
the
concept
of
the
circuit
judge
morgan
was
correct
that
this
statute
is
sort
of
straightforward.
it
says
that
any
place
that
sells
an
alleged
obscene
publication
by
the
definition
of
the
criminal
law,
that’s
using
the
criminal
law
definition,
is
declared
to
be
and
shall
be
a
public
nuisance.
hence,
the
activity
is
clear
that
what
they
can
do
is
one
publication
offered
for
sale
could
in
fact,
if
it’s
declared
to
be
obscene,
justify
the
closing
the
entire
premises.
that’s
what
the
statute
says.
that’s
what
the
statute
gives
them
authority
to
do.
now,
certainly
we
have
a
question
of
who
won
the
race
to
the
courthouse
door.
well,
obviously,
in
this
context,
we
didn’t
know
and
couldn’t
know
what’s
in
the
mind
of
the
prosecutor.
he
files
a
civil
action
in
the
state
court.
we
of
course,
move
right
into
federal
court
taking
and
trying
to
have
an
election
of
the
jurisdictional
forum
in
which
we
seek
to
litigate
our
rights
and
if
we
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
sir,
they
have
not
generally
done
so.
there
are
some
states
of
course
which
i
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
have
done
so
but
they
are
statutory
weren't
like
the
statute
at
bar
here.
the
new
riviera
arts
theater
case
was
--
didn’t
have
such
a
statute
in
their
jurisprudence,
hence,
we
have
one
here.
there
was
such
a
statute
as
we
indicated
yesterday
in
the
matter
of
presume
limited
which
the
state
court
construed
to
authorize
the
entire
shuttering
of
the
process
and
of
course
that’s
what
is
here.
we
don’t
have
a
statute
saying
that
the
sale
of
that
article
would
be
a
public
nuisance.
this
court
addressed
itself
to
the
question
in
paris
adult
theater
of
whether
or
not
a
procedure
could
be
employed
whereby
a
film
or
a
book
or
anything
which
might
be
declared
to
be
obscene
in
civil
proceeding
could
not
further
be
shown
and
that’s
of
course
now
the
law.
but
here
they
are
going
on
a
broader
attack
saying
we’re
going
to
shut
the
entire
premises
because
of
the
one
thing.
now,
if
the
court’s
language
in
heller
and
roaden
has
significance
in
quoting
bantam
books
and
such
that
any
law
that
necessary
involves
a
prior
restraint,
comes
to
this
court
bearing
a
heavy
presumption
against
its
validity
and
we’re
talking
about
that
kind
of
law
in
the
context
of
this
case.
as
i
said
and
it’s
the
extreme
to
which
the
law
certainly
can
be
applied
that
is
obvious
and
patently
apparent.
as
i
said
before,
if
a
department
store
which
might
offer
for
sale
the
book
of
joy
of
sex,
if
it
prosecuted
one
or
two
week
ago
it
didn’t
say,
okay
they
sold
this
book,
hence
the
department
store
could
be
closed
and
everything
there
can
be
seized
as
contraband
and
destroyed.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
if
it
found
just
one
item
obscene,
then
everything
will
be
declared.
this
is
not
a
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
unless
they
ultimately
gave
it
a
narrowing
construction.
but
then
the
plain
factual
--
i
mean
the
thing
on
its
face
absolutely
says
that
the
premises
shall
be
constituted
on
public
nuisance.
it
isn’t
the
publication,
it
would
be
nuisance,
it’s
the
use
of
the
premises
would
be
a
public
nuisance.
if
it’s
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
of
course
we
have
taken
the
younger
case
and
this
court
has
said
that
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
that
the
concepts
of
comity
and
federalism
and
such
would
apply
and
that
certainly
that
is
the
law
as
of
today.
this
court
left
open
as
the
comments
of
the
various
writers
of
the
opinion
made
clear
that
in
a
civil
case,
they
would
post
to
you
--
would
postpone
the
reaching
of
that
question
and
of
course
the
[voice
overlap].
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir
that’s
clear.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
think
that’s
what
we’re
probably
have
to
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that’s
correct
and
of
course
the
dramatic
presentation
or
argument
regarding
the
closing
of
an
entire
store
is
only
made
of
course
apparent
to
show
that
this
is
a
matter
of
prior
restraint
obviously
and
that
this
is
the
way
the
state
is
going
about
it
and
the
factual
situation
here.
if
we
have
to
take
the
issue
that
in
criminal
cases,
the
criminal
cases
started,
we
cannot
have
any
federal
court
intervention.
we
said,
“okay
that’s
one
theory,
that’s
one
rational
of
law,”
then
say
now
in
civil
cases,
it
can
apply
out
of
there,
then
we
really
don’t
have
anything
left
and
the
civil
rights
act
would
almost
be
meaningless.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
i
am
saying
that
the
civil
rights
act,
the
statute
of
congress
would
be
almost
meaningless
then
if
we
were
to
be
foreclosed
the
right
to
go
into
a
federal
court
when
a
civil
matter
has
been
presented.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
but
in
the
context
of
the
case
like
this
if
we
were
first
to
file
before
there
was
any
action
on
the
part
of
the
state
then
we’d
be
faced
with
the
problem,
is
there
a
case
in
controversy.
and
if
there’s
no
case
in
controversy,
can
we
in
fact
go
in
and
seek
a
declaratory
judgment.
so
then
what
good
is
it
to
have
zwickler
versus
koota
that
says
that
we
have
an
election
of
forums
or
that
election
of
forums
to
litigate
federal
constitutional
rights
should
be
allowed?
so
we
are
saying
that
if
this
court
were
to
say
that
in
civil
cases
already
commenced
where
of
course
of
prosecution
knows
what
it's
going
to
do
in
advance
that
we
are
foreclosed
from
going
to
federal
court
to
litigate
our
federal
constitutional
rights
then
i
am
saying
statute
of
congress
that
permits
injunctive
relief
would
almost
be
meaningless
or
at
least
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
but
i
think
this
court
answered
the
questions
there
with
regard
to
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
and
then
you
have
of
course
the
--
that
is
true
except
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
agree,
but
we
take
the
position
of
course
that
it
is
not
an
aid
in
the
enforcement
of
criminal
law.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
it’s
purely
civil,
your
honors
because
you
do
not
have
the
seizure
of
film
to
use
in
a
criminal
case.
none
of
this
material
needed
to
be
seized
to
be
used
in
any
of
the
criminal
cases.
it’s
just
a
shuttering
of
the
premises
because
something
was
alleged
to
be
obscene
and
of
course
we’re
being
deprived
of
the
criminal
burden
of
proof
by
the
proceedings
because
it’s
a
single
judge
deciding
whether
or
not
he
thinks
an
item
in
there
was
obscene.
and
if
he
thinks
an
item
was
obscene,
the
entire
place
is
shuttered
and
we
say
that
that
makes
a
significant
difference
and
federalism
should
not
be
the
bar
to
us
seeking
our
belief
in
the
federal
court
in
this
regard.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
but
then
again
we
wouldn’t
have
the
concept
of
the
potential
of
the
irreparable
harm.
the
irreparable
harm
being
the
potential
for
self-censorship,
the
potential
for
chilling
of
speech.
one
year
he
had
--
if
he’s
had
a
business
and
he
sold
the
publication
which
might
be
held
by
one
judge
to
be
obscene
somewhere
and
that
the
entire
business
could
be
shuttered
then
there
would
be
a
chilling
of
speech
which
of
course
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
then
we’d
have
all
the
attended
protection
that
a
criminal
case
would
afford
a
litigant
that
is
not
present
necessarily
in
the
civil
case.
whether
it’s
the
burden
of
proof,
the
right
of
juries,
things
of
this
nature.
so
we
say
that
this
isn’t
necessarily
the
same.
so
at
least
in
a
jury
case
where
it
is
applicable
in
a
criminal
case,
you
--
if
a
community
standard
as
this
court
has
indicated
is
to
be
determined
whether
it’s
local
or
statewide
at
least
the
court
has
said
the
jury
is
the
representative
of
the
community
and
can
make
that
determination.
you
don’t
have
that
with
a
judge
who
may
necessarily
justify
in
one
publication
may
offend
him
subjectively
and
he
--
or
otherwise
in
applying
the
test
of
law,
he
might
find
it
obscene
and
then
says
okay,
fine.
one
publication
we
will
shutter
the
entire
premises.
so
i
think
it’s
different.
the
criminal
case
is
--
you
can,
if
there’s
a
single
criminal
case
now
i
think
what
this
court
is
said
is,
if
there
is
a
single
criminal
case
you
can
defend
your
position
in
that
case.
however,
suppose
the
government
brought
multiple
cases
all
across
the
country
relating
to
the
same
old
type
of
activity
to
the
same
parties,
it
might
be
that
if
the
defendant
in
that
situation
could
say
that
he
thinks
the
government
is
engaging
in
bad
faith
enforcing
the
law
or
harassment
that
he
could
go
forward.
but
here
we
have
as
i
said
a
shuttering;
it’s
completely
independent
of
the
criminal
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
sir
because
they’re
asking
to
destroy
everything.
there
is
no
question
or
contention.
there
is
no
request
that
the
material
be
delivered
up
to
the
sheriff
and/or
to
the
clerk
of
the
court
for
potential
use
in
the
criminal
case
as
there
was
in
the
paris
adult
theater
concept
or
walter’s,
there’s
a
walter’s
case
there
where
that
concept
has
been
held
or
in
the
palaio
versus
mcauliffe
case
which
was
the
rationale
of
the
fifth
circuit
that
the
two
judges
in
this
court
in
the
case
here
bottomed
themselves
on,
so
we'd
say
no
sir
we
don’t
feel
that
there
are.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
the
original
case
was
removed.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
i
think
it
was
remanded
back
after
the
judges
decided
that
they
had
decided
to
abstain
or
in
essence
settled
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
sir.
it
has
not.
it
has
not
as
of
yesterday
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
and
of
course,
i
think
there’s
circumstances
even
developed
after
this
case
had
started
that
litigation
was
independent
and
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
irreparable.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
right,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes
sir,
that
is
an
alternative
argument
we
have
made.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir
and
of
course
the
court
did
not
reach
that
issue
because
of
the
way
they
disposed
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir
that’s
right
and
that’s
one
of
the
things
we
had
hoped
to
demonstrate
and
tried
to
demonstrate
in
the
court
below.
so,
in
summary
as
i
said,
our
position
is
that
younger
should
not
apply
these
civil
cases.
this
court
has
before
it
lynch
versus
snepp
in
which
no
action
has
been
taken
and
i
think
it
was
relied
upon
by
counsel
in
our
case
here
in
the
brief.
we
say
that
this
is
a
kind
of
situation
that
if
this
court
takes
the
language
that
any
statute
that
involves
itself
a
prior
restraint
bears
a
heavy
presumption
against
its
constitutional
validity,
this
is
the
kind
of
case
that
should
have
allowed
the
determination.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
i
think,
particularly
it
should
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
we
don’t.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
or
punish
the
criminal
law
to
finish
it
for
the
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
but
then
a
lot
of
this
cases,
your
honor
if
it’s
a
civil
case
involving
litigants,
private
litigants
who
are
not
state
officials
or
state
action
then
we
lose
some
of
the
rights
under
our
civil
rights
act
there
because
there
must
be
certainly
some
color
under
color
statements
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
likewise,
of
course
younger
is
now
seemingly
saying
that
it
always
--
it
almost
always
applies
to
criminal
actions
and
of
course
i
was
making
the
other
simplification
with
regard
to
civil
actions.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
and
that
was
merely
the
purpose.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
sir.
i
don’t
think
so.
this
court,
in
the
opinion
of
the
chief
justice
indicated
that
material
is
not
contraband
until
such
time
as
there
has
been
a
judicial
determination
or
at
least
an
adversary
hearing
of
some
type
after
the
seizure
or
before
the
seizure
in
a
civil
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
but
i
think
this
court
said
in
the
heller-roaden
series
of
cases
that
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
civil
forfeiture
that
perhaps
quantity
both
[voice
overlap]
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
that’s
correct.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
now,
of
course,
it
is
designed
as
to
protect
public
from
the
material
going
out
into
the
public
and
injurious
to
their
health
and
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
they
are
simply
saying
that
if
you
sell
--
well,
of
course
we
don’t
know
what
the
legislative
theory
is
in
passing
the
legislation
except
just
to
close
the
place
down.
it
could
be
conceivably
said
to
be
that
they
feel
that
they
should
--
mr.
robert
eugene

yes,
sir.
but
you
take
the
situation
of
the
drive-in
theater
that
this
court
dealt
with
in
raab
versus
state
of
washington
where
there
was
out
in
the
open
and
it
was
a
constant
repetitive
kind
of
thing.
well,
okay
that
may
have
first
amendment
implications,
but
then
again
had
they
brought
an
nuisance
action
because
of
the
continual
showing
of
the
kind
of
material
that
people
were
having
it
thrust
upon
them
and
i
think
they
are
in
that
kind
of
area.
the
state
may
have
had
the
interest
that
would
have
justified
perhaps
going
forward.
but
we
say
this
is
not
that
kind
of
interest.
thank
you.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
yes,
sir.
incidentally,
there
was
some
discussion
about
sanders
and
i
wanted
to
tell
the
court
that
as
counsel
was
alluding
to,
there
was
a
zoning
problem
in
sanders
and
that
is
to
say
that
the
city
council
or
the
county
council
of
the
dekalb
county
said
that
no
adult
bookstores
or
theaters
could
be
within
200
yards
of
a
church,
a
school,
a
pool
hall
and
things
like
that.
so,
it’s
very
conceivable
in
view
of
that
absolute
concept
that
sanders
could
be
decided
on
that
issue
and
not
reach
the
nuisance
issue.
it
was
not
declared
to
be
a
nuisance.
it
just
says
a
matter
of
zoning.
no
adult
theater
or
bookstore
can
be
placed
within
so
many
hundred
yards
of
these
various
facilities.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
it’s
not
a
nuisance
sir.
it
just
can’t
have
a
license
and
if
it
you
can’t
have
license
here
and
its
zone,
you’re
not
just
allowed
to
be
operating
here,
right
sir.
and
in
--
further,
under
the
georgia
provisions,
the
determination
of
the
place
of
being
as
a
nuisance
does
not
entitle
us
to
an
automatic
right
of
the
supersedeas
bond.
in
fact,
in
sanders,
i
think
he
was
closed
approximately
three
weeks
before
the
state
judge
gave
him
a
$50,000.00
supersedeas
bond
to
operate
and
finally
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
he
is
open
sir.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
he’s
been
open
because
there’s
been
no
further
action
by
the
state
court
i
suppose
pending
the
decision
of
this
court.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
if
federal
court.
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
no,
sir,
no
stay
has
been
granted.
none
was
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
and
in
this
instance
as
we
pointed
out
just
to
be
sure
that
the
court
understands.
if
the
jury
finds
any
of
the
publications
brought
by
the
prosecutions
--
mr.
robert
eugene
smith
as
to
the
issue
of
the
obscenity
of
the
publication.
then
the
judge
will
apply
the
law
as
it
is
written
obliviously
and
shutter
the
premises.
so
the
jury
would
not
determine
whether
it
was
a
nuisance,
the
jury
would
determine
whether
the
material
was
obscene
under
the
standards
this
court
has
set
forth.
and
incidentally,
as
the
court
mentioned
in
mitchum
which
is
the
case
that
we
argued
before
the
court
sometime
ago,
the
mitchum
case
is
now
being
held
by
the
district
court
judge
waiting
a
decision
in
this
case.
thank
you.
