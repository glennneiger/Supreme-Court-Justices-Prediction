mr.
william
d.
eggers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
william
d.
eggers
from
rochestor,
new
york,
counsel
for
appellants.
we
are
here
on
an
appeal
for
a
final
judgment
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
this
today,
is
a
particularly
appropriate
day
to
hear
this
case
involving
as
it,
does
voting
rights.
the
question
presented
is,
whether
new
york
may
refuse
to
provide
any
means
of
voting,
including
absentee
means
for
its
pretrial
detainees
and
misdemeanants
under
circumstances
when
first,
such
persons
are
called
by
voters,
not
disenfranchised
by
any
state
law.
secondly,
absentee
voting
rights
are
extended
to
persons
medically
unable
to
appear
in
person
and
to
whole
wrath
of
persons
unable
to,
unavoidably
absent
from
their
county
of
residence.
new
york
has
advanced
no
overriding
governmental
interest,
whatsoever
in
this
proceeding
at
any
stage.
the
facts
are
simple.
appellants
are
a
class
of
72
qualified
voters.
in
the
fall
of
1972,
they
were
confined
to
the
mineral
county
jail
as
persons
convicted
of
minor
crimes,
not
any
felonies,
or
as
pretrial
detainees,
un-convicted
of
any
crimes,
whatsoever,
for
awaiting
trial
and
unable
to
post
bail.
they
are
voting
at
age,
they
have
legal
residencies
in
mineral
county.
i
must
stress
that
these
persons
are
qualified
to
vote.
new
york,
has
by
law
disenfranchised
felons.
it
has
disenfranchised
only
felons
and
those
are
not
members
of
our
class.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
it
is
precisely
our
point
that
it
does
provide
a
means
by
which
such
persons
can
vote.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
it
provides,
your
honor,
for
persons
confined
at
home,
at
a
hospitals
or
an
institution
by
reason
of
illness
or
medical
disability.
prior
to
and
at
the
state
court
proceedings,
appellants
have
sought
every
possible
means
of
voting.
any
possibly
--
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
i
believe
that
they
can,
under
new
york
law.
i
know
that
the
statute
has
not
been
construed
and
this
is
often
raised
in
any
court
proceeding
that
i
am
aware
of
but
the
statute
is
quite
broad
and
a
class
of
persons
that
can
vote,
that
are
out
of
county,
it
includes
people
that
are
out
of
county
by
reason
of
their
occupation,
their
duties,
their
employment,
persons
that
are
out
of
county
by
reason
of
a
vacation,
a
wife
of
a
person
who
is
out
of
county
by
reason
of
his
occupation,
that
wife
can
vote
and
the
statute
is
quite
broad
and
i
believe
that
it
would
cover
people
in
the
same
session
that
our
people
are
in,
if
they
happen
to
be
outside
the
county
of
their
legal
residence.
there
is
also,
in
new
york
state,
a
program
of
mobile
registration
which
would
permit
volunteer
registrars
to
setup
branch
offices
for
registration
in
various
locations.
in
the
fall
of
1972,
this
was
done
at
various
shopping
centers,
at
schools,
in
fact
the
volunteer
for
registrars
were
willing
to
setup
facilities
in
the
visiting
areas
of
the
mineral
county
jail
and
registrar
inmates
of
the
jail
in
that
fashion
and
the
sheriff
denied
their
request.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
there
are
two
questions
that
we
have.
one
is
simply
the
ballots
or
some
means
of
voting
on
election
day.
but
of
course
to
be
able
to
vote,
you
have
to
be
registered,
so
we
are
also
raising
the
question
of
whether,
inmates
of
the
jail
can
be
registered
by
absentee
means,
or
by
some
other
means
that
they
can
have
at
the
jail.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
that
is
right
your
honor.
some
are
registered,
some
are
not
registered.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
yes,
there
are
your
honor.
they
are
almost
identical
to
the
means,
by
which
people
can
get
absentee
ballots.
you
can
get
or
you
can
register
by
absentee
if
you
are
confined
in
a
hospital
or
an
institution
or
home,
by
a
reason
of
a
medical
disability.
you
can
also
register
by
absentee
means,
if
you
are
out
of
county.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
that
is
not
true,
no.
now
your
honor,
the
two
lower
courts
construed
the
absentee
registration
at
balloting
statutes
in
our
favor.
they
say
that,
then
the
key
term
was
physical
disability
and
they
found,
there
are
people
who
are
physically
disabled
in
a
sense
that
they
physically
could
not
get
to
the
polls.
they
thus
avoided
the
constitutional
question.
new
york,
court
of
appeals
then
reversed.
they
dismissed
the
petition
that
we
have
filed
and
which
in
we
have
broadly
asked
for
any
sort
of
relief
available
under
state
law
and
they
left
us
with
no
possibility
of
relief
whatsoever,
under
state
law.
they
rejected
all
means
of
voting
in
person,
they
construed
the
statute,
and
they
ruled
against
our
constitutional
claims
that
we
had
raised
in
every
single
stage.
so
the
question
now
is
quite
clear
cut.
we
are
contending
simply
that
the
state
interests
that
are
asserted
in
support
of
these
classifications
in
the
statutes,
are
not
the
kind
of
state
interest
that
justify
the
denial
of
fundamental
right.
it's
as
simple
as
that
and
i
think
that
decisions
of
this
court
make
it
quite
clear
that
when
you
have
a
fundamental
right
such
as
voting,
then
you
take
a
hard
--
mr.
william
d.
eggers
it
is
both
your
honor,
it
is
a
fundamental
right
that
is
grounded
in
the
constitution,
i
think
--
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
i
believe
it
is
a
constitutional
right
and
it
is
so
important
that
it
is
a
fundamental
right
under
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well,
i
would
not
want
to
create
a
hierarchy
of
constitutional
rights.
i
think,
that
there
is
at
least
one,
and
that
is
the
right
to
vote,
that
is
the
most
fundamental
of
all
rights,
because
this
is
preservative
of
every
single
right
that
person
might
have.
i
think
that
this
was
recognized
in
the
rodriguez
case
in
the
last
term,
where
the
footnote
says
very
clearly,
that
at
least,
voting
rights
are
considered
fundamental
in
the
sense
that
they
are
grounded
in
the
constitution.
so
i
think
that
what
we
are
talking
about
here
are
rights
that
are
very
important
and
that
has
never
been
a
question
of
that.
at
least
the
equal
right
to
voting
is
a
constitutionally
grounded
right.
it
is
grounded
in
the
equal
protection
clause.
you
have
an
equal
right
to
voting,
equal
with
other
citizens
of
the
state
and
this
particular
right,
is
a
personal
right
of
citizenship.
it
really
tells
a
citizen,
does
he
count,
especially
today.
does
he
count
as
a
citizen.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
except
that
the
ones
that
are
awaiting
sentence
have
been
or
they
have
been
sentenced,
or
have
been
sentenced
only
for
misdemeanors.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
that
would
be
quite
a
different
case
because
the
state
then
would
have
been
--
mr.
william
d.
eggers
if
they
are
serving
a
sentence
because
of
course,
a
convicted
misdemeanant
who
was
paroled
on
a
work
release
program
can
vote
the
same
as
any
other
citizen.
so
i
think,
we
have
a
question
also
of
due
process
in
that
respect,
would
it
be
consistent
with
due
process
for
the
state
to
deny
the
right
to
vote
in
the
arbitrary
way
that
it
is
done
here.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well,
i
think
procedural
as
well
your
honor
because,
we
have
the
question
of
whether
the
standards,
there
are
any
standards,
is
there
a
right
to
hearing
this
kind
of
procedural
due
process
would
have
--
mr.
william
d.
eggers
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
think
as
the
persons
that
are
simply
detained,
they
have,
of
course,
a
higher
claim
because
these
persons
are
presumptively
innocent
under
our
law.
now
it
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
our
law.
i
think
that
there
are
many
decisions
at
the
lower
courts
that
recognized
that
pretrial
detention
has
a
very
limited
legitimate
purpose.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
have
outlined,
this
case
involves
the
absolute
denial
of
fundamental
rights
and
if
it
were
not
enough
that
fundamental
rights
are
at
stake,
the
particular
class
here
affected
is
the
only
class
that
is
forcibly
restrained
from
attending
the
polls
by
state
action
and
with
respect
to
this
class,
i
think
we
would
have
to
ask
whether
the
state's
application
of
its
criminal
process
is
consistent
with
due
process
of
law,
with
respect
to
the
deprivations
of
these
particular
rights.
and
i
think
you
would
have
to
ask
whether
these
deprivations
are
necessary
consequences
of
employment
in
jail.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
the
restraint
in
mcdonald
was
the
same.
the
impact
on
fundamental
rights
was
different,
because
in
the
record
in
the
mcdonald
case,
there
was
no
showing
that
the
state
would
not
provide
the
alternative
means
of
voting
that
we
have
requested,
in
this
case
had
been
denied.
so
you
had
before
the
court,
what
the
court
termed
to
be
an
incidental
burden,
persons
for
whom
voting
would
by
absentee,
would
be
inconvenience,
but
according
to
presumptions
that
the
court
made
in
that
case,
are
not
the
only
means
left
to
them.
in
our
case,
this
is
the
only
possible
means
left
to
them,
because
we
have
denied
the
other
rights.
and
although
the
statutes,
the
discriminatory
statutes
that
we
are
challenging
here
are
not
drawn
on
their
face,
on
the
basis
of
race
or
wealth.
they
have
a
very
heavy
burden
on
those
persons,
who
are
financially
unable
to
post
bail.
if
this
person
were
charged
with
the
same
crime,
could
post
bail
of
course
he
could
vote
just
as
same
as
any
other
citizen
could.
so
we
have
here
a
combination
of
factors,
that
we
submit
requires
this
court
to
require
the
very
strictest
of
equal
protection
review.
the
highest
standard
that
this
court
applies
in
any
case,
and
that
standard
of
course
requires
that
we
take
a
look;
a
very
hard
look
at
the
sort
of
governmental
interest
that
are
justified
because
those
governmental
interests
must
be
overriding
in
the
sense
that
they
are
enough,
to
justify
the
absolute
denial
of
voting
rights.
and
the
tests,
i
think
are
three.
the
interest
asserted
has
to
be
of
compelling
importance.
the
means
that
the
state
uses
have
to
be
closely
related
to
the
purposes,
and
they
must
not
unreasonably
burden
the
exercise
of
fundamental
rights.
and
there
must
be
an
element
of
necessity,
about
the
states
claim.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
we
would
not.
convicted
felons
are
specifically
disqualified
by
the
state
under
its
election
law.
this
is
a
state
interest
that's
related
to
the
qualifications
for
voting
because
i
think
there
is
a
presumption
that
if
a
person
has
a
committed
a
very
serious
crime,
such
as
felony
that
he
has
not
showing
the
respect
for
law,
that
a
person
that
is
going
to
vote
should
have.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
we
do
your
honor
because
the
state
has
done
so.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well,
your
honor
no
member
of
the
class
that
we
represent,
none
of
my
clients
are
convicted
felons.
so
that
we
don't
raise
the
question
of
whether
convicted
felons
may
vote
by
absentee
ballots.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
i
represent
the
clients
that
i
have.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well
i
am
not
saying
that,
that
question
is
not
a
proper
question.
i
am
saying
it's
not
raised
today.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
that's
correct
your
honor,
and
as
i
understand
the
law
if
a
misdemeanant
is
confined
out
of
county
in
new
york
state,
he
may
vote.
it's
certainly
clear
to
me,
under
the
federal
voting
rights
amendment
of
1970,
that
he
is
unavoidably
absent
from
his
county,
and
entitled
to
vote
in
special
presidential
elections
at
least.
i
think
the
new
york
state
absentee
statute
would
also
permit
such
a
person
to
vote
by
absentee,
if
he
is
merely
confined
out
of
the
county
of
his
residence.
so
we
don't
have
involved
here,
a
claim
by
the
state
that
all
misdemeanants
lose
to
right
to
vote.
it's
not
involved
at
all.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
that
is
our
fundamental
approach.
we
are
claiming
an
equal
right
to
vote.
but
we
are
not
--
we
are
also
raising
--
mr.
william
d.
eggers
the
discrimination
is
in
favor
of
persons
that
are
confined
in
hospitals,
in
institutions
or
at
home
on
medical
grounds.
it's
in
favor
of
persons
who
happen
to
be
confined
out
of
the
county
of
their
residence.
it's
also
discrimination,
i
think
in
favor
of
a
number
other
persons
that
are
out
of
county
on
vacation
or
for
any
other
reasons.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
those
persons
certainly
can
vote
in
new
york
state.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
no,
your
honor,
they
may
not
vote,
because
by
virtue
of
the
conviction
itself,
a
felons
loses
his
right
to
vote.
so
we
are
dealing
in
our
class
of
the
persons,
we
have
only
persons
that
are
qualified
to
vote
under
new
york
state
law.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
i
believe
that,
voting
rights
are
more
important
than
the
expression
rights
there
in
the
first
amendment.
i
think
that
they
may
reasonably
be
related
to
first
amendment
rights.
but
i
think
we
are
raising
a
second
point
to
answer
mr.
justice
white's
question
fully.
we
are
raising
the
due
process
claim
that
persons
can
find,
especially
as
pretrial
detainees,
do
not
lose
all
their
rights.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well
i
would
say
the
same
as
to
misdemeanants
because
prisoners
don't
lose
all
their
rights,
that's
how
even
as
to
felons,
they
have
the
access
to
the
courts
--
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well,
your
honor,
we
think
it's
a
different
case
when
the
state
has
considered
the
question
as
to
qualifications
for
voting,
and
said
the
commission
of
specific
crimes,
the
high
crimes
disqualify
you
as
a
matter
of
voter
qualifications.
but
of
course
the
state
hasn't
said
that
as
to
misdemeanants
and
i
think
as
to
minor
crimes,
it
would
be
very
hard
for
the
state
to
say
that
alone
should
justify
the
denial
of
voting
rights.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
i
couldn't
agree
with
you
more,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
in
a
purely
arbitrary
means
of
denying
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
that
is
a
reason
that
was
accepted
by
this
court
in
mcdonald
case
under
the
rational
basis
test.
but
i
think
to
address
myself
to
that
particular
reason,
it
seems
to
me
very
strange
to
tell
somebody
that
he
may
not
vote
because
state
officials
might
interfere
with
his
right
to
vote.
if
our
rights
were
that
easily
lost
it
would
seem
to
me
no
rights
would
remain
at
all.
because
there
are
any
numbers
of
means,
by
which
the
state
could
address
itself
to
that
particular
problem.
it
could
make
it
unlawful
for
a
local
official
to
interfere
with
the
right
of
citizens
to
vote.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well,
i
think
methods
of
persuasion
are
one
thing,
but
if
the
deputy
sheriffs
would
have
used
something
more
than
persuasion,
i
think
that,
that
might
be
a
very
serious
problem.
but
it
is
a
sort
of
problem
with
the
state
cannot
deal
with,
by
restrictive
means,
means
consistent
with
the
exercise
of
fundamental
rights.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well
your
honor,
i
think
that
they
already
have
the
means
that
are
necessary
to
inform
themselves.
they
can
have
access
to
newspapers,
they
can
receive
information
through
the
mails.
and
i
don't
think,
that
there
would
be
a
need
to
adopt
such
a
corollary
right
at
least
not
in
the
absolute
way.
they
could
be
written
statements
presented
to
persons
confined
in
trail
and
of
course
somebody
could
be
confined
in
jail
a
very
short
time
before
an
election.
he
may
be
fully
informed
on
the
issues
of
the
day,
and
yet
under
the
construction,
and
under
the
denials
that
we
have
in
this
case,
that
person
would
be
denied
to
right
to
vote.
so
i
think
that
that
is
not
a
substantial
reasons
that's
involved
here
at
the
denials.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
veterans'
hospital
case,
that
particular
situation
is
one,
that
you
can
be
in
county
confined
in
veterans'
hospital
and
you
can
vote
and
fairly
very
similar
to
other
persons
in
county
hospitals
or
in
the
other
hospital
within
the
county,
were
entitled
to
vote
because
they
are
unable
to
attend
the
polls
in
now,
i
think
that
it
is
a
very
strange
statue.
it's
strange
because
it
denies
my
clients
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well
your
honor,
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that,
there
are,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
referred
to
two
in
particular,
they
referred
to
poll
watchers
and
poll
watchers
can
go
vote
the
same
as
anyone
else
can.
it's
simply
a
part
time
job
for
the
day
and
you
may
have
to
take
time
on
your
lunch
out
of
book
but
so
does
everybody
else.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well,
your
honor,
i
think
there
would
be
some
question
with
respect
to
particular
classes
as
to
their
construction
the
new
york
courts
would
give
that
class,
because
if
they
are
going
to
extend
the
right
to
vacationers,
it
would
seem
to
me
and
all
he
have
to
be
is
out
of
county
on
a
vacation.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that's
quite
a
broad
basis
for
construing
almost
anybody
as
being
at
least
on
probably
on
a
vacation.
the
statute
is
quite
liberal,
it
seems
on
its
face
and
allows
most
people
out
of
county
to
vote.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
it
certainly
is
liberal
in
certain
directions.
it's
not
liberal
towards
a
class
that
i
believe
is
a
disfavored
class,
that
class
and
i
am
referring
to
my
clients,
the
class
who
is
in
the
terms
of
judge
burke
from
the
court
below.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well
your
honor,
any
person
can
find
any
hospital.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
any
person
who
is
confined
in
a
hospital,
any
hospital
in
new
york
and
unable
to
get
to
the
polls
is
provided
for
by
the
statutes
as
i
read
the
statues.
and
a
question...
mr.
william
d.
eggers
there
is
a
statute,
there
are
numbers
of
statutes
that
apply
to
this
case
and
they
have
not
properly
been
meshed
together.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
i
think
the
detainee
has
a
higher
claim
under
the
due
process
clause,
because
as
to
him,
any
unlawful
denial
of
rights
is
a
much
prior
concern
of
this
court
because
that
it
infringes
our
ideas
of
the
presumption
of
innocence.
as
to
those
persons,
i
think
there
is
a
very
special
claim
here.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
because
new
york
has
not
made
the
claim
that
a
misdemeanant
is
unqualified
to
vote,
in
the
many
respects,
he
is
in
the
same
position
as
the
other
members
of
our
class
are
in
the
respects
that
are
directly
before
this
court.
so
i
think
then
we
come
to
what
governmental
interests
are
being
asserted
here
and
in
fact,
they
haven't
identified
any,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
the
appellees
in
this
case,
don't
even
claim
that
there
is
a
compelling
interest
and
when
they
say
that
something
is
at
all
reasonable,
it
seems
to
me
if
you
take
a
hard
look
at
any
sort
of
the
interest
that
they
are
claiming,
it's
not
even
reasonable.
it's
a
problem
of
the
fact
of
confinement
or
didn't
know
different
in
their
confinement
that
people
were
confined
at
hospitals.
they
can
vote
both
by
mail,
register
by
mail,
they
could
if
the
means
were
provided.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
i
would
be,
but
i
might
point
out
that
fact
that
there
are
absentee
ballots
means
that
there
is
a
quite
an
easy
means.
it's
no
problem
at
all
for
the
state.
if
there
were
none,
i
think
that
they
would
still
have
to
defend
against
our
claim
that
registration
and
jail
facilities,
voting
facilities
could
be
set
up
in
the
jail.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
case
of
love
against
hughes
in
which
federal
district
court
sitting
in
ohio
faced
exactly,
a
case
almost
exactly
the
same
as
this
case,
a
challenge
to
the
absentee
statutes
and
a
request
for
any
other
means,
simply
directed
the
sheriff
in
the
board
of
elections
to
establish
election
facilities
in
jail
by
paper
ballots
and
ballot
boxes.
i
see
no
reason
why
this
is
unworkable.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well
your
honor,
i'd
have
to
say
frankly
that
i
think
they
do
have
a
better
claim.
they
are
the
only
class
of
citizens
that
are
restrained
by
the
state.
they
are
the
only
class
for
which
you
have
to
ask,
is
the
state
confinement
consistent
with
the
due
process
clause,
and
i
think
it
is
consistent
with
the
due
process
clause
only
if
the
rights
that
are
lost
are
justified
either
by
law
or
as
necessary
consequences
of
confinement.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well,
to
be
in
the
same
position
that
our
people
are
in,
he
would
have
to
be
confined
and
unable
to
get
to
the
polls.
now,
that's
simply
voluntary,
so
we
could
voluntarily
attain
his
own
release.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
he
is
not
barred.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
if
such
a
person
were
in
fact
fully
confined,
it
still
seems
to
me
the
state
has
good
reasons
to
question
whether
that
person
is
an
eligible
voter.
that
case,
however
is
not
before
the
court
because
we
are
simply
concerned
about
the
discriminatory
treatment
between
our
clients
and
other
persons
such
as
medically
confined
person
who
can
vote.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well,
certainly
your
honor,
as
to
pretrial
detainees,
we
can't
make
such
a
presumption.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well
as
i
said,
i
think
that
there
is
a
higher
claim
for
pretrial
detainees
as
the
misdemeanants,
your
honor,
they
haven't
committed
this
sort
of
crime
that
the
state
says,
disqualify
them
from
voting
and
i
think
this
court
still
has
a
special
concern
with
whether
state
imposed
confinement
has
consequences
that
are
unnecessary.
for
example,
a
prisoner
doesn’t
lose
his
right
to
practice
his
religion
in
jail.
he
doesn’t
lose
his
access
to
the
courts
or
access
to
the
mail
and
i
think
that
there
numbers
of
rights
that
a
person
has
even
though
he
has
committed,
even
a
felony
and
we
don't
have
that
case
here.
your
honor,
i
believe
if
we
take
a
hard
look
at
the
sort
of
governmental
interests
that
are
asserted
here,
we
simply
don't
find
any
that
can
stand
up
against
the
right
to
vote
and
they
have
to
come
up
with
a
governmental
interest
that's
overriding
in
the
sense
that
it
can
justify
the
absolute
denial.
i
think
they
haven't
done
that.
i
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time?
mr.
william
d.
eggers
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
are
not
the
sort
of
rights
that
can
be
left
for
legislative
action.
it
can't
be
told
that
this
is
reformed
legislation
therefore
we
have
to
go
the
legislature.
it
does
not
make
sense
when
we
are
talking
about
constitutionally
protected
rights.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well
i
think
that
is
right,
your
honor.
this
is
a
fundamental
right,
it
is
not
the
sort
of
right
where
we
can
be
asked
to
depend
on
the
legislative
whim
because
if
there
were
that
sort
of
right,
we
would
not
be
before
this
court.
this
is
an
important
fundamental
right,
and
we
have
a
problem
here
of
a
denial
of
equal
treatment
in
voting
rights.
it
is
not
just
any
economic
or
social
regulation
where
reformed
legislation
--
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
depends
on
the
sort
of
rights
that
are
involved,
the
sort
of
class
that
is
affected,
and
when
we
have
fundamental
rights.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well,
in
a
constitutional
context,
your
honor,
but
there
are
many
cases
that
might
involve
rights
less
important
than
these,
and
there
it
might
be
appropriate
to
refer
to
the
legislature
and
say,
well,
this
is
reformed
legislation
and
in
this
particular
area,
we
are
going
to
consider
this
one,
when
we
are
considering
whether
the
statute
is
reasonable,
but
not
when
we
are
going
to
apply
the
strict
standard
of
judicial
scrutiny
that's
required
in
this
case.
thank
you,
mr
chief
justice,
and
i
now
submit
the
case
on
behalf
of
my
client.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
am
william
d.
eggers
from
rochestor,
new
york,
counsel
for
appellants.
we
are
here
on
an
appeal
for
a
final
judgment
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
this
today,
is
a
particularly
appropriate
day
to
hear
this
case
involving
as
it,
does
voting
rights.
the
question
presented
is,
whether
new
york
may
refuse
to
provide
any
means
of
voting,
including
absentee
means
for
its
pretrial
detainees
and
misdemeanants
under
circumstances
when
first,
such
persons
are
called
by
voters,
not
disenfranchised
by
any
state
law.
secondly,
absentee
voting
rights
are
extended
to
persons
medically
unable
to
appear
in
person
and
to
whole
wrath
of
persons
unable
to,
unavoidably
absent
from
their
county
of
residence.
new
york
has
advanced
no
overriding
governmental
interest,
whatsoever
in
this
proceeding
at
any
stage.
the
facts
are
simple.
appellants
are
a
class
of
72
qualified
voters.
in
the
fall
of
1972,
they
were
confined
to
the
mineral
county
jail
as
persons
convicted
of
minor
crimes,
not
any
felonies,
or
as
pretrial
detainees,
un-convicted
of
any
crimes,
whatsoever,
for
awaiting
trial
and
unable
to
post
bail.
they
are
voting
at
age,
they
have
legal
residencies
in
mineral
county.
i
must
stress
that
these
persons
are
qualified
to
vote.
new
york,
has
by
law
disenfranchised
felons.
it
has
disenfranchised
only
felons
and
those
are
not
members
of
our
class.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
it
is
precisely
our
point
that
it
does
provide
a
means
by
which
such
persons
can
vote.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
it
provides,
your
honor,
for
persons
confined
at
home,
at
a
hospitals
or
an
institution
by
reason
of
illness
or
medical
disability.
prior
to
and
at
the
state
court
proceedings,
appellants
have
sought
every
possible
means
of
voting.
any
possibly
--
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
i
believe
that
they
can,
under
new
york
law.
i
know
that
the
statute
has
not
been
construed
and
this
is
often
raised
in
any
court
proceeding
that
i
am
aware
of
but
the
statute
is
quite
broad
and
a
class
of
persons
that
can
vote,
that
are
out
of
county,
it
includes
people
that
are
out
of
county
by
reason
of
their
occupation,
their
duties,
their
employment,
persons
that
are
out
of
county
by
reason
of
a
vacation,
a
wife
of
a
person
who
is
out
of
county
by
reason
of
his
occupation,
that
wife
can
vote
and
the
statute
is
quite
broad
and
i
believe
that
it
would
cover
people
in
the
same
session
that
our
people
are
in,
if
they
happen
to
be
outside
the
county
of
their
legal
residence.
there
is
also,
in
new
york
state,
a
program
of
mobile
registration
which
would
permit
volunteer
registrars
to
setup
branch
offices
for
registration
in
various
locations.
in
the
fall
of
1972,
this
was
done
at
various
shopping
centers,
at
schools,
in
fact
the
volunteer
for
registrars
were
willing
to
setup
facilities
in
the
visiting
areas
of
the
mineral
county
jail
and
registrar
inmates
of
the
jail
in
that
fashion
and
the
sheriff
denied
their
request.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
there
are
two
questions
that
we
have.
one
is
simply
the
ballots
or
some
means
of
voting
on
election
day.
but
of
course
to
be
able
to
vote,
you
have
to
be
registered,
so
we
are
also
raising
the
question
of
whether,
inmates
of
the
jail
can
be
registered
by
absentee
means,
or
by
some
other
means
that
they
can
have
at
the
jail.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
that
is
right
your
honor.
some
are
registered,
some
are
not
registered.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
yes,
there
are
your
honor.
they
are
almost
identical
to
the
means,
by
which
people
can
get
absentee
ballots.
you
can
get
or
you
can
register
by
absentee
if
you
are
confined
in
a
hospital
or
an
institution
or
home,
by
a
reason
of
a
medical
disability.
you
can
also
register
by
absentee
means,
if
you
are
out
of
county.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
that
is
not
true,
no.
now
your
honor,
the
two
lower
courts
construed
the
absentee
registration
at
balloting
statutes
in
our
favor.
they
say
that,
then
the
key
term
was
physical
disability
and
they
found,
there
are
people
who
are
physically
disabled
in
a
sense
that
they
physically
could
not
get
to
the
polls.
they
thus
avoided
the
constitutional
question.
new
york,
court
of
appeals
then
reversed.
they
dismissed
the
petition
that
we
have
filed
and
which
in
we
have
broadly
asked
for
any
sort
of
relief
available
under
state
law
and
they
left
us
with
no
possibility
of
relief
whatsoever,
under
state
law.
they
rejected
all
means
of
voting
in
person,
they
construed
the
statute,
and
they
ruled
against
our
constitutional
claims
that
we
had
raised
in
every
single
stage.
so
the
question
now
is
quite
clear
cut.
we
are
contending
simply
that
the
state
interests
that
are
asserted
in
support
of
these
classifications
in
the
statutes,
are
not
the
kind
of
state
interest
that
justify
the
denial
of
fundamental
right.
it's
as
simple
as
that
and
i
think
that
decisions
of
this
court
make
it
quite
clear
that
when
you
have
a
fundamental
right
such
as
voting,
then
you
take
a
hard
--
mr.
william
d.
eggers
it
is
both
your
honor,
it
is
a
fundamental
right
that
is
grounded
in
the
constitution,
i
think
--
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
i
believe
it
is
a
constitutional
right
and
it
is
so
important
that
it
is
a
fundamental
right
under
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well,
i
would
not
want
to
create
a
hierarchy
of
constitutional
rights.
i
think,
that
there
is
at
least
one,
and
that
is
the
right
to
vote,
that
is
the
most
fundamental
of
all
rights,
because
this
is
preservative
of
every
single
right
that
person
might
have.
i
think
that
this
was
recognized
in
the
rodriguez
case
in
the
last
term,
where
the
footnote
says
very
clearly,
that
at
least,
voting
rights
are
considered
fundamental
in
the
sense
that
they
are
grounded
in
the
constitution.
so
i
think
that
what
we
are
talking
about
here
are
rights
that
are
very
important
and
that
has
never
been
a
question
of
that.
at
least
the
equal
right
to
voting
is
a
constitutionally
grounded
right.
it
is
grounded
in
the
equal
protection
clause.
you
have
an
equal
right
to
voting,
equal
with
other
citizens
of
the
state
and
this
particular
right,
is
a
personal
right
of
citizenship.
it
really
tells
a
citizen,
does
he
count,
especially
today.
does
he
count
as
a
citizen.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
except
that
the
ones
that
are
awaiting
sentence
have
been
or
they
have
been
sentenced,
or
have
been
sentenced
only
for
misdemeanors.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
that
would
be
quite
a
different
case
because
the
state
then
would
have
been
--
mr.
william
d.
eggers
if
they
are
serving
a
sentence
because
of
course,
a
convicted
misdemeanant
who
was
paroled
on
a
work
release
program
can
vote
the
same
as
any
other
citizen.
so
i
think,
we
have
a
question
also
of
due
process
in
that
respect,
would
it
be
consistent
with
due
process
for
the
state
to
deny
the
right
to
vote
in
the
arbitrary
way
that
it
is
done
here.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well,
i
think
procedural
as
well
your
honor
because,
we
have
the
question
of
whether
the
standards,
there
are
any
standards,
is
there
a
right
to
hearing
this
kind
of
procedural
due
process
would
have
--
mr.
william
d.
eggers
that
is
correct
your
honor.
i
think
as
the
persons
that
are
simply
detained,
they
have,
of
course,
a
higher
claim
because
these
persons
are
presumptively
innocent
under
our
law.
now
it
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
our
law.
i
think
that
there
are
many
decisions
at
the
lower
courts
that
recognized
that
pretrial
detention
has
a
very
limited
legitimate
purpose.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
i
have
outlined,
this
case
involves
the
absolute
denial
of
fundamental
rights
and
if
it
were
not
enough
that
fundamental
rights
are
at
stake,
the
particular
class
here
affected
is
the
only
class
that
is
forcibly
restrained
from
attending
the
polls
by
state
action
and
with
respect
to
this
class,
i
think
we
would
have
to
ask
whether
the
state's
application
of
its
criminal
process
is
consistent
with
due
process
of
law,
with
respect
to
the
deprivations
of
these
particular
rights.
and
i
think
you
would
have
to
ask
whether
these
deprivations
are
necessary
consequences
of
employment
in
jail.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
the
restraint
in
mcdonald
was
the
same.
the
impact
on
fundamental
rights
was
different,
because
in
the
record
in
the
mcdonald
case,
there
was
no
showing
that
the
state
would
not
provide
the
alternative
means
of
voting
that
we
have
requested,
in
this
case
had
been
denied.
so
you
had
before
the
court,
what
the
court
termed
to
be
an
incidental
burden,
persons
for
whom
voting
would
by
absentee,
would
be
inconvenience,
but
according
to
presumptions
that
the
court
made
in
that
case,
are
not
the
only
means
left
to
them.
in
our
case,
this
is
the
only
possible
means
left
to
them,
because
we
have
denied
the
other
rights.
and
although
the
statutes,
the
discriminatory
statutes
that
we
are
challenging
here
are
not
drawn
on
their
face,
on
the
basis
of
race
or
wealth.
they
have
a
very
heavy
burden
on
those
persons,
who
are
financially
unable
to
post
bail.
if
this
person
were
charged
with
the
same
crime,
could
post
bail
of
course
he
could
vote
just
as
same
as
any
other
citizen
could.
so
we
have
here
a
combination
of
factors,
that
we
submit
requires
this
court
to
require
the
very
strictest
of
equal
protection
review.
the
highest
standard
that
this
court
applies
in
any
case,
and
that
standard
of
course
requires
that
we
take
a
look;
a
very
hard
look
at
the
sort
of
governmental
interest
that
are
justified
because
those
governmental
interests
must
be
overriding
in
the
sense
that
they
are
enough,
to
justify
the
absolute
denial
of
voting
rights.
and
the
tests,
i
think
are
three.
the
interest
asserted
has
to
be
of
compelling
importance.
the
means
that
the
state
uses
have
to
be
closely
related
to
the
purposes,
and
they
must
not
unreasonably
burden
the
exercise
of
fundamental
rights.
and
there
must
be
an
element
of
necessity,
about
the
states
claim.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
we
would
not.
convicted
felons
are
specifically
disqualified
by
the
state
under
its
election
law.
this
is
a
state
interest
that's
related
to
the
qualifications
for
voting
because
i
think
there
is
a
presumption
that
if
a
person
has
a
committed
a
very
serious
crime,
such
as
felony
that
he
has
not
showing
the
respect
for
law,
that
a
person
that
is
going
to
vote
should
have.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
we
do
your
honor
because
the
state
has
done
so.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well,
your
honor
no
member
of
the
class
that
we
represent,
none
of
my
clients
are
convicted
felons.
so
that
we
don't
raise
the
question
of
whether
convicted
felons
may
vote
by
absentee
ballots.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
i
represent
the
clients
that
i
have.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well
i
am
not
saying
that,
that
question
is
not
a
proper
question.
i
am
saying
it's
not
raised
today.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
that's
correct
your
honor,
and
as
i
understand
the
law
if
a
misdemeanant
is
confined
out
of
county
in
new
york
state,
he
may
vote.
it's
certainly
clear
to
me,
under
the
federal
voting
rights
amendment
of
1970,
that
he
is
unavoidably
absent
from
his
county,
and
entitled
to
vote
in
special
presidential
elections
at
least.
i
think
the
new
york
state
absentee
statute
would
also
permit
such
a
person
to
vote
by
absentee,
if
he
is
merely
confined
out
of
the
county
of
his
residence.
so
we
don't
have
involved
here,
a
claim
by
the
state
that
all
misdemeanants
lose
to
right
to
vote.
it's
not
involved
at
all.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
that
is
our
fundamental
approach.
we
are
claiming
an
equal
right
to
vote.
but
we
are
not
--
we
are
also
raising
--
mr.
william
d.
eggers
the
discrimination
is
in
favor
of
persons
that
are
confined
in
hospitals,
in
institutions
or
at
home
on
medical
grounds.
it's
in
favor
of
persons
who
happen
to
be
confined
out
of
the
county
of
their
residence.
it's
also
discrimination,
i
think
in
favor
of
a
number
other
persons
that
are
out
of
county
on
vacation
or
for
any
other
reasons.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
those
persons
certainly
can
vote
in
new
york
state.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
no,
your
honor,
they
may
not
vote,
because
by
virtue
of
the
conviction
itself,
a
felons
loses
his
right
to
vote.
so
we
are
dealing
in
our
class
of
the
persons,
we
have
only
persons
that
are
qualified
to
vote
under
new
york
state
law.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
i
believe
that,
voting
rights
are
more
important
than
the
expression
rights
there
in
the
first
amendment.
i
think
that
they
may
reasonably
be
related
to
first
amendment
rights.
but
i
think
we
are
raising
a
second
point
to
answer
mr.
justice
white's
question
fully.
we
are
raising
the
due
process
claim
that
persons
can
find,
especially
as
pretrial
detainees,
do
not
lose
all
their
rights.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well
i
would
say
the
same
as
to
misdemeanants
because
prisoners
don't
lose
all
their
rights,
that's
how
even
as
to
felons,
they
have
the
access
to
the
courts
--
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well,
your
honor,
we
think
it's
a
different
case
when
the
state
has
considered
the
question
as
to
qualifications
for
voting,
and
said
the
commission
of
specific
crimes,
the
high
crimes
disqualify
you
as
a
matter
of
voter
qualifications.
but
of
course
the
state
hasn't
said
that
as
to
misdemeanants
and
i
think
as
to
minor
crimes,
it
would
be
very
hard
for
the
state
to
say
that
alone
should
justify
the
denial
of
voting
rights.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
i
couldn't
agree
with
you
more,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
in
a
purely
arbitrary
means
of
denying
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
that
is
a
reason
that
was
accepted
by
this
court
in
mcdonald
case
under
the
rational
basis
test.
but
i
think
to
address
myself
to
that
particular
reason,
it
seems
to
me
very
strange
to
tell
somebody
that
he
may
not
vote
because
state
officials
might
interfere
with
his
right
to
vote.
if
our
rights
were
that
easily
lost
it
would
seem
to
me
no
rights
would
remain
at
all.
because
there
are
any
numbers
of
means,
by
which
the
state
could
address
itself
to
that
particular
problem.
it
could
make
it
unlawful
for
a
local
official
to
interfere
with
the
right
of
citizens
to
vote.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well,
i
think
methods
of
persuasion
are
one
thing,
but
if
the
deputy
sheriffs
would
have
used
something
more
than
persuasion,
i
think
that,
that
might
be
a
very
serious
problem.
but
it
is
a
sort
of
problem
with
the
state
cannot
deal
with,
by
restrictive
means,
means
consistent
with
the
exercise
of
fundamental
rights.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well
your
honor,
i
think
that
they
already
have
the
means
that
are
necessary
to
inform
themselves.
they
can
have
access
to
newspapers,
they
can
receive
information
through
the
mails.
and
i
don't
think,
that
there
would
be
a
need
to
adopt
such
a
corollary
right
at
least
not
in
the
absolute
way.
they
could
be
written
statements
presented
to
persons
confined
in
trail
and
of
course
somebody
could
be
confined
in
jail
a
very
short
time
before
an
election.
he
may
be
fully
informed
on
the
issues
of
the
day,
and
yet
under
the
construction,
and
under
the
denials
that
we
have
in
this
case,
that
person
would
be
denied
to
right
to
vote.
so
i
think
that
that
is
not
a
substantial
reasons
that's
involved
here
at
the
denials.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
veterans'
hospital
case,
that
particular
situation
is
one,
that
you
can
be
in
county
confined
in
veterans'
hospital
and
you
can
vote
and
fairly
very
similar
to
other
persons
in
county
hospitals
or
in
the
other
hospital
within
the
county,
were
entitled
to
vote
because
they
are
unable
to
attend
the
polls
in
now,
i
think
that
it
is
a
very
strange
statue.
it's
strange
because
it
denies
my
clients
the
right
to
vote.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well
your
honor,
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that,
there
are,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
referred
to
two
in
particular,
they
referred
to
poll
watchers
and
poll
watchers
can
go
vote
the
same
as
anyone
else
can.
it's
simply
a
part
time
job
for
the
day
and
you
may
have
to
take
time
on
your
lunch
out
of
book
but
so
does
everybody
else.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well,
your
honor,
i
think
there
would
be
some
question
with
respect
to
particular
classes
as
to
their
construction
the
new
york
courts
would
give
that
class,
because
if
they
are
going
to
extend
the
right
to
vacationers,
it
would
seem
to
me
and
all
he
have
to
be
is
out
of
county
on
a
vacation.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that's
quite
a
broad
basis
for
construing
almost
anybody
as
being
at
least
on
probably
on
a
vacation.
the
statute
is
quite
liberal,
it
seems
on
its
face
and
allows
most
people
out
of
county
to
vote.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
it
certainly
is
liberal
in
certain
directions.
it's
not
liberal
towards
a
class
that
i
believe
is
a
disfavored
class,
that
class
and
i
am
referring
to
my
clients,
the
class
who
is
in
the
terms
of
judge
burke
from
the
court
below.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well
your
honor,
any
person
can
find
any
hospital.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
any
person
who
is
confined
in
a
hospital,
any
hospital
in
new
york
and
unable
to
get
to
the
polls
is
provided
for
by
the
statutes
as
i
read
the
statues.
and
a
question...
mr.
william
d.
eggers
there
is
a
statute,
there
are
numbers
of
statutes
that
apply
to
this
case
and
they
have
not
properly
been
meshed
together.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
i
think
the
detainee
has
a
higher
claim
under
the
due
process
clause,
because
as
to
him,
any
unlawful
denial
of
rights
is
a
much
prior
concern
of
this
court
because
that
it
infringes
our
ideas
of
the
presumption
of
innocence.
as
to
those
persons,
i
think
there
is
a
very
special
claim
here.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
because
new
york
has
not
made
the
claim
that
a
misdemeanant
is
unqualified
to
vote,
in
the
many
respects,
he
is
in
the
same
position
as
the
other
members
of
our
class
are
in
the
respects
that
are
directly
before
this
court.
so
i
think
then
we
come
to
what
governmental
interests
are
being
asserted
here
and
in
fact,
they
haven't
identified
any,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
and
the
appellees
in
this
case,
don't
even
claim
that
there
is
a
compelling
interest
and
when
they
say
that
something
is
at
all
reasonable,
it
seems
to
me
if
you
take
a
hard
look
at
any
sort
of
the
interest
that
they
are
claiming,
it's
not
even
reasonable.
it's
a
problem
of
the
fact
of
confinement
or
didn't
know
different
in
their
confinement
that
people
were
confined
at
hospitals.
they
can
vote
both
by
mail,
register
by
mail,
they
could
if
the
means
were
provided.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
your
honor,
i
would
be,
but
i
might
point
out
that
fact
that
there
are
absentee
ballots
means
that
there
is
a
quite
an
easy
means.
it's
no
problem
at
all
for
the
state.
if
there
were
none,
i
think
that
they
would
still
have
to
defend
against
our
claim
that
registration
and
jail
facilities,
voting
facilities
could
be
set
up
in
the
jail.
i
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
case
of
love
against
hughes
in
which
federal
district
court
sitting
in
ohio
faced
exactly,
a
case
almost
exactly
the
same
as
this
case,
a
challenge
to
the
absentee
statutes
and
a
request
for
any
other
means,
simply
directed
the
sheriff
in
the
board
of
elections
to
establish
election
facilities
in
jail
by
paper
ballots
and
ballot
boxes.
i
see
no
reason
why
this
is
unworkable.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well
your
honor,
i'd
have
to
say
frankly
that
i
think
they
do
have
a
better
claim.
they
are
the
only
class
of
citizens
that
are
restrained
by
the
state.
they
are
the
only
class
for
which
you
have
to
ask,
is
the
state
confinement
consistent
with
the
due
process
clause,
and
i
think
it
is
consistent
with
the
due
process
clause
only
if
the
rights
that
are
lost
are
justified
either
by
law
or
as
necessary
consequences
of
confinement.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well,
to
be
in
the
same
position
that
our
people
are
in,
he
would
have
to
be
confined
and
unable
to
get
to
the
polls.
now,
that's
simply
voluntary,
so
we
could
voluntarily
attain
his
own
release.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
he
is
not
barred.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
if
such
a
person
were
in
fact
fully
confined,
it
still
seems
to
me
the
state
has
good
reasons
to
question
whether
that
person
is
an
eligible
voter.
that
case,
however
is
not
before
the
court
because
we
are
simply
concerned
about
the
discriminatory
treatment
between
our
clients
and
other
persons
such
as
medically
confined
person
who
can
vote.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well,
certainly
your
honor,
as
to
pretrial
detainees,
we
can't
make
such
a
presumption.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well
as
i
said,
i
think
that
there
is
a
higher
claim
for
pretrial
detainees
as
the
misdemeanants,
your
honor,
they
haven't
committed
this
sort
of
crime
that
the
state
says,
disqualify
them
from
voting
and
i
think
this
court
still
has
a
special
concern
with
whether
state
imposed
confinement
has
consequences
that
are
unnecessary.
for
example,
a
prisoner
doesn’t
lose
his
right
to
practice
his
religion
in
jail.
he
doesn’t
lose
his
access
to
the
courts
or
access
to
the
mail
and
i
think
that
there
numbers
of
rights
that
a
person
has
even
though
he
has
committed,
even
a
felony
and
we
don't
have
that
case
here.
your
honor,
i
believe
if
we
take
a
hard
look
at
the
sort
of
governmental
interests
that
are
asserted
here,
we
simply
don't
find
any
that
can
stand
up
against
the
right
to
vote
and
they
have
to
come
up
with
a
governmental
interest
that's
overriding
in
the
sense
that
it
can
justify
the
absolute
denial.
i
think
they
haven't
done
that.
i
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
new
york
court
of
appeals.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time?
mr.
william
d.
eggers
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
these
are
not
the
sort
of
rights
that
can
be
left
for
legislative
action.
it
can't
be
told
that
this
is
reformed
legislation
therefore
we
have
to
go
the
legislature.
it
does
not
make
sense
when
we
are
talking
about
constitutionally
protected
rights.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well
i
think
that
is
right,
your
honor.
this
is
a
fundamental
right,
it
is
not
the
sort
of
right
where
we
can
be
asked
to
depend
on
the
legislative
whim
because
if
there
were
that
sort
of
right,
we
would
not
be
before
this
court.
this
is
an
important
fundamental
right,
and
we
have
a
problem
here
of
a
denial
of
equal
treatment
in
voting
rights.
it
is
not
just
any
economic
or
social
regulation
where
reformed
legislation
--
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
depends
on
the
sort
of
rights
that
are
involved,
the
sort
of
class
that
is
affected,
and
when
we
have
fundamental
rights.
mr.
william
d.
eggers
well,
in
a
constitutional
context,
your
honor,
but
there
are
many
cases
that
might
involve
rights
less
important
than
these,
and
there
it
might
be
appropriate
to
refer
to
the
legislature
and
say,
well,
this
is
reformed
legislation
and
in
this
particular
area,
we
are
going
to
consider
this
one,
when
we
are
considering
whether
the
statute
is
reasonable,
but
not
when
we
are
going
to
apply
the
strict
standard
of
judicial
scrutiny
that's
required
in
this
case.
thank
you,
mr
chief
justice,
and
i
now
submit
the
case
on
behalf
of
my
client.
