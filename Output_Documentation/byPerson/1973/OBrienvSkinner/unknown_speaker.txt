unknown
speaker
on
that
basis
then
you
would
have
convicting
felons
also
for
--.
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
draw
a
distinction
between
a
convicted
felon
and
convicted
and
incarcerated
misdemeanant.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
doesn’t
prevent
attack
on
what
the
state
has
done,
you
are
not
only
saying
that
you
would
accept
that
distinction.
unknown
speaker
and
you
won't
be
here
tomorrow
insisting
that
the
--
unknown
speaker
you
might
have
be
representing
another
felon
--
unknown
speaker
your
fundamental
approach
is
equal
protection
clause,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
in
favor
of
whom
is
there
a
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
misdemeanants
who
are
appealing
and
are
on
bail?
unknown
speaker
can
felons
who
are
convicted
but
are
on
appeal?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr
eggers,
you
are
not
arguing,
apart
from
your
equal
protection
part.
this
is
a
first
amendment
right
which
cannot
be
denied
irrespective
of
--
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
i
was
just
talking
about
the
misdemeanantly
convicted
ones,
who
are
serving
sentences.
unknown
speaker
then
you
are
arguing
the
felons
case
in
a
way.
unknown
speaker
mr.
eggers,
let
me
ask
another
question
about,
what
i
regard
as
a
very
unusual
statute.
it
refers
to
unavoidable
absence
because
he
is
inmate
of
veterans'
bureau
hospital.
suppose
he
is
down
at
the
county
hospital
or
columbia
hospital
new
york
city,
i
take
it
he
would
be
entitled
to
an
absentee
ballot
and
then
down
later
it
speaks
of
unavoidable
absence
to
the
business
or
vacation.
he
is
outside
the
county
attending
the
funeral
of
a
relative,
he
is
not
eligible.
may
be
i
should
ask
your
opponent.
unknown
speaker
i
may
be
just
as
sympathetic
to
a
person
that's
in
the
county
hospital
as
distinguished
from
the
veteran's
hospital.
unknown
speaker
much
more
sympathetic
than
to
a
convicted
misdemeanant.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
i
don't
read
them
that
way
and--
unknown
speaker
you
could
draw
any
distinction
between
a
convicted
misdemeanant
and
a
detainee
at
all
or
do
they
stand
to
fall
together?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
new
york
didn't
give
any
or
the
if
the
state
didn't
give
any
absentee
ballots
at
all?
would
you
still
be
here?
unknown
speaker
even
though
he
is
there
voluntarily
relevant
by
commitment.
unknown
speaker
well,
not
always.
unknown
speaker
between
20
to
30
days
and
be
confined.
unknown
speaker
yet
some
are
there
because
of
their
own
fault.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
am
thinking
the
other
group.
that's
why
i
asked
you
before
whether
you
do
a
distinction
between
them.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
of
any
misdemeanant
cases
like
that?
unknown
speaker
do
you
mean,
there
are
number
of
detainees
who
are
under
charges
of
felonies
and
the
bail
is
set
very
high,
that
maybe
homicides,
armed
robberies,
rape,
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
say,
aren't
these
detainees
some
of
them
like
of
that
time?
unknown
speaker
no,
not.
now
these
detainees
are
not
only
or
are
they
merely
detainees?
unknown
speaker
no,
that's
not,
i
just
don't
know,
we
were
talking
about
them
in
the
jail.
unknown
speaker
i
am
not
sure
that
there
are
lot
of
detainees
--
unknown
speaker
or
they
might
have
thought
they
were
going
to
be
out
of
town
on
vacation.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
be
clear
about
this.
under
your
statute,
even
if
they
are
held
for
homicide,
rape,
armed
robbery
and
the
other
felony,
and
they
live
outside
the
county,
they
may
vote
as
detainees.
unknown
speaker
am
i
right
in
my
assumption
that
--
unknown
speaker
why
do
they
permit
voting
by
those
who
are
incarcerated
or
detained
outside?
unknown
speaker
you
said
that
you
did.
unknown
speaker
you
just
gave
your
justifications.
unknown
speaker
what
rational
basis
is
there
for
permitting
voting
by
those
detained
outside
the
county?
certainly
not
the
one
you
were
just
giving.
unknown
speaker
on
the
rational
basis
test
--
unknown
speaker
but
meanwhile
what
do
we
do?
is
it
not
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
you
haven't
suggested
to
me
a
rational
basis
yet
for
saying
that
those
confined
inside
the
county
may
not
vote
but
those
who
find
outside
may.
unknown
speaker
this
kind
of
a
case
where
the
statute
is
grown
like
topsy,
so
to
speak
and
--
unknown
speaker
all
of
a
sudden
you
have
some
–
the
opposition
feels
there
are
some
inequities
here.
as
you
said
little
while
ago,
i
am
sure
the
legislature
hasn't
thought
of
all
these
things
completely
through
--
unknown
speaker
on
that
basis
then
you
would
have
convicting
felons
also
for
--.
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
draw
a
distinction
between
a
convicted
felon
and
convicted
and
incarcerated
misdemeanant.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
doesn’t
prevent
attack
on
what
the
state
has
done,
you
are
not
only
saying
that
you
would
accept
that
distinction.
unknown
speaker
and
you
won't
be
here
tomorrow
insisting
that
the
--
unknown
speaker
you
might
have
be
representing
another
felon
--
unknown
speaker
your
fundamental
approach
is
equal
protection
clause,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
in
favor
of
whom
is
there
a
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
and
how
about
misdemeanants
who
are
appealing
and
are
on
bail?
unknown
speaker
can
felons
who
are
convicted
but
are
on
appeal?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr
eggers,
you
are
not

apart
from
your
equal

part.
this

unknown

then
you

the
felons

in

unknown

mr.

let
me
ask
another
question
about,
what
i
regard
as
a
very

statute.
it
refers
to
unavoidable
absence
because
he
is
inmate
of
veterans'
bureau
hospital.
suppose
he
is
down
at
the
county
hospital
or
columbia
hospital
new
york
city,
i
take
it
he
would
be
entitled
to
an
absentee
ballot
and
then
down
later
it
speaks
of
unavoidable
absence
to
the
business
or

he
is
outside
the
county
attending
the
funeral
of
a
relative,
he
is
not
eligible.
may
be
i
should
ask
your
opponent.
unknown
speaker
i
may
be
just
as
sympathetic
to
a
person
that's
in
the
county
hospital
as
distinguished
from
the
veteran's
hospital.
unknown
speaker
much
more
sympathetic
than
to
a
convicted
misdemeanant.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
i
don't
read
them
that
way
and--
unknown
speaker
you
could
draw
any
distinction
between
a
convicted
misdemeanant
and
a
detainee
at
all
or
do
they
stand
to
fall

unknown

well,
if
the
new
york
didn't
give
any
or
the
if
the

didn't

at

would
you
