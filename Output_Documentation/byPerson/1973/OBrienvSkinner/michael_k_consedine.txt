mr.
michael
k.
consedine
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
county
of
monroe
contends
your
honor
that
these
statues
are
remedial
statutes
established
to
expand
the
franchise
in
the
state
of
new
york.
they
are
not
statutes
aimed
at
any
particular
class
in
question
today.
they
were
not
aimed
at
misdemeanants
in
the
serving
time
in
a
jail
after
the
time
for
registering
and
voting
has
expired,
nor
were
they
aimed
at
persons
being
held
and
detained,
pending
disposition
of
a
case
again
after
the
time
for
registering
and
voting,
but
absentee
ballot
has
expired.
further,
we
feel
that
there
is
not
really
a
class
here
that
would
come
in
the
ambit
of
the
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
you
really
don't
have
a
legal
class
as
such.
you
have
certain
persons
who
can't
make
bail,
who
really
in
the
state
of
new
york
are
incarcerated
after
7
days
before
election.
anyone
who
is
released
up
to
seven
days
before
election,
may
register
and
vote
under
our
statutes.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
state
of
new
york
has
held
that
the
statute
which
expanded
the
franchise,
considerably
in
the
state
of
new
york
over
period
of
time,
does
not
fall
within
the
equal
protection
clause
because
these
persons
have
this
disability
posed
upon
them
by
impracticalities
and
contingencies.
there
are
of
course,
reasons
under
the
rational
impracticalities.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i
am
not
entirely
sure
of
what
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
mind.
into
my
mind,
i
think
they
were
touching
on
a
rational
basis
tests.
you
can
concede
--
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well,
that
would
relate
only
to
detainees.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
yeah
and
your
honor,
you
must
consider
the
fact--
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
convicted
misdemeanants.
alright
so
these
detainees
consider
this
fact
your
honor,
these
detainees
between
the
time
they
registered
to
vote
and
the
time
they
can
vote,
may
turn
into
felons
--
.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
your
honor,
well
that's
true.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
yeah,
that's
true.
that
could
apply
to
almost
to
anybody,
that
registers,
but
there
is
a
likelihood,
a
greater
likelihood
that
this
particular
type
of
person
that
may
fall
in
that
kind
of
category.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
i
agree
with
you
your
honor,
at
that
point.
i
think
the
issue
here
is
whether
this
particular
type
of
person
is
a
class,
is
a
suspect
class
as
this
court
has
declared
race
and
wealth
to
be.
your
honor
feels
that
the
fact
that
a
man
may
not
make
bail,
may
bring
this
in
to
the
area
of
wealth,
we
disagree
with
that
your
honor.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
no.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
but
your
honor,
there
are
cases
where
bails
are
very
high
and
even
a
person
of
moderate
wealth
cannot
make
that.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
the
reason
for
bail
is
to
ensure
the
person's
attendance
at
court.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
that
maybe
a
reason,
however.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that
the
reason
he
cannot
vote
because
he
doesn’t
have
enough
money
to
bail,
doesn’t
bring
this
within
the
suspect
classification
based
on
wealth
because
there
are
cases
where
bails
are
very
high,
in
serious
cases,
$100,000,
$50,000,
that
doesn’t...
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well,
we
were
just
referring.
no,
i
don't
your
honor.
we
were
just
referring
to
that
class,
that
would
be
detained
prior
to
the
trial
for
felony.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
that's
right
and
my
contention
is
that
would
take
this
out
of
that
area
of
classification.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
there
are
detainees
that
are
there
because
bail
is
extremely
high.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
no,
there
maybe
detainees
waiting
for
a
case,
a
homicide
case,
they
are
indicted
with
a
felony
being
detained
because
they
can
be
bailed.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
misdemeanants,
pre-trial
detainees
i
believe
is
the
class
referred
to
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well,
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
which
of
these
72
men
were
charged
with
felonies,
i
don't
know
whether
any
of
them
are
present
time
incarcerated.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
that's
right.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
for
one
reason
or
the
other.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
if
they
live
at
another
county
there
are
reasons
to
believe
that
they
may
vote.
and
i
also
--
it
exclude
persons
who
have
applied
for
absentee
ballot
before
their
incarceration
that
naturally
received
this
that
the
mail
would
be
forwarded
to
them.
they
could
vote
by
absentee
ballot.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
a
person
may
have
other
reasons
that
you
think
he
needs
it
and
between
the
time
he
registers
for
an
absentee
ballot
is
incarcerated,
that
could
be
considerably
happen.
we
are
relying
heavily
on
this
court's
determination
in
the
mcdonald
case.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
the
statute
as
i
understand,
it
refers
very
complicated
but
these
statutes
refer
to
those
persons
who
live
in
the
county,
who
are
unable
to
attend
the
poll
there
due
to
the
various
reasons
given
here,
for
instance,
business
duties,
we
also
have
statutes
relating
to
military
service.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
i
only
think
so.
i
have
come
to
that
conclusion
and
board
of
elections
in
monroe
county
has
come
to
that
conclusion,
they
act
under
that
assumption
also.
so
that's
not
an
issue
here.
i
think
the
issue
is
basically
the
fourteenth
amendment
issue
and
we
set
up
an
legal
classification
here.
there
--
should
you
oppose
a
very
stringent
standard
test
here.
we
feel
that
the
court
has
clearly
stated
in
mcdonald
that
and
mr.
justice
brennan
has
stated
in
mcdonald
and
subsequently
in
osser
that
absent,
the
creation
of
a
suspect
class.
here
therefore
relating
primarily
to
race
and
wealth.
such
stringent
standards
should
not
be
applied.
we
feel
that
on
the
record,
there's
no
showing
that
any
attempts
were
made
to
promote
legislation
in
new
york
state
legislature
to
expand
this.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well,
i
don't
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well,
the
prisoners
couldn't
promote
legislation?
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well,
the
prisoners,
i
represented
here
by
six
attornies,
their
name
appear
on
the
brief,
they
could
certainly
promote
legislation,
if
they
feel
it's
worthy.
i
am
saying
that
there
are
so
many--
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
your
honor,
these
prisoners
are
protected
by
a
number
of
groups,
there
are
franchises,
you
notice
named
new
york
civil
liberties
union
is
upon
here.
and
my
brother
here,
represent
this
attorney
in
one
of
the
most
of
the
prestigious
law
firms
in
the
upstate
new
york.
they
have
many
people
who
would
press
their
cause
in
new
york
state
legislature.
i
am
saying
that
there
are
conceivable
--
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
i
am
saying
your
honor,
first
that
it
is
not
an
non-constitutional
evil,if
in
fact
it
is
an
evil.
i
am
stating
that
it
is
not
within
the
ambit
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
the
state
legislature
by
no
legal
design
has
established
a
class
to
as
being
denied
the
right
to
vote
by
absentee
ballot
or
to
register
by
absentee
means.
i
think,
we
are
arguing
here
just
that
right
to
vote
and
register
by
absentee
means.
we
feel
the
fact
that
they
have
expanded
this
privilege
to
various
classes
but
have
not
expanded
the
same
to
new
york
state
to
prisoners
that
who
are
misdemeanants
or
lesser.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
or
who
live
in
a
county
and
who
are
detainees
for
some
reason,
prior
to
conviction
are
not
felons
but
for
some
reason
detained
without
convictions.
in
fact,
if
this
class
has
not
been
included
in
the
statute,
it
does
not
bring
that
class
under
the
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
frankly,
unlike
all
the
other
cases
this
court
has
decided,
there
is
no
showing
that
the
state
legislature
singled
them
out
for
some
disability.
they
were
not
saying
black
people
may
not
vote
or
they
were
not
refusing
--
they
were
not
refusing
--
by
the
refusal
to
action
--
by
the
refusal
to
act
disenfranchising
suburban
counties
where
they
–
as
you
handle
the
one
man
one
vote
decisions.
this
is
a
case
where
the
state
of
new
york
legislature
has
expanded
over
the
years
this
privilege.
they
may
do
so
further.
there
may
indeed
be
other
classes
who
don't
have
this
privilege.
i
am
saying
there
are
many
complications
involved
here.
the
argument
i
was
going
to
raise
has
been
has
been
already
raised
by
the
member
of
this
court,
such
persons
might
be
subject
to
manipulation
either
by
the
jailers
or
the
political
machines
that
controls
the
jail,
or
by
certain
prisoners
within
the
jail.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well,
the
legislature
no
doubt
is
satisfied
that
there
are
not
--
that
you
know
that,
well
i
do
not
know
what
goes
on
the
mind
of
the
legislature.
i
am
saying--
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
no,
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
that
there
are
many,
many
question.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well
i
am
relating
to
the
rational
basis,
of
the
argument.
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
that--
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
no,
no,
i
do
not
think
that
the
legislation,
i
am
saying
the
legislature
never
considered
to
take
the
class
of
persons
to
drew
up
this
legislation.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
i
am
saying
the
legislature
should
consider
this.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well
if
you
find
that
is
within
that
suspect
classification,
i
am
sure
you
will
find
that
unconstitutional.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
rational
argument
i
think.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well,
your
honor,
again
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
operations
to
sheriff's
association
either
the
state
of
new
york
though.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
any
conceivable
basis,
i
think
is
the
thrust
of
mcgowan
case,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
yes.
basically,
my
argument
is
this
that
the
legislature
--
that
the
classification
here
is
not
a
suspect
classification
and
therefore
there
is
a
reasonable
rational
basis
for
this
legislation,
and
if
there
are
any
inequities,
certainly,
the
state
legislature
would
be
at
this
time
the
proper
body
to
remedy
them.
i
was
impressed
by
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
that
they
pointed
out
that
this
particular
72
gentlemen
are
denied
their
right
to
vote
by
absentee
means,
not
by
any
legal
design
of
the
legislature.
the
most
important
cases
of
all
bore
upon
actions
of
the
legislature
that
discriminate
against
the
suspect
class
or
has
consistently
refused
to
promote
a
class's
right
to
vote.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
county
of
monroe
contends
your

that

further,
we
feel
that
there

not

that

anyone

the

that
the

mr.
michael

consedine
well,
if
your

please,
i
am
not
entirely

of
what
was
in
the
court
of

mind.
into
my
mind,
i
think
they
were
touching

tests.
you
can
concede
--
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well,
that
would
relate
only
to
detainees.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
yeah
and
your
honor,
you
must
consider
the
fact--
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
convicted
misdemeanants.
alright
so
these
detainees
consider
this
fact
your
honor,
these
detainees
between
the
time
they
registered
to
vote
and
the
time
they
can
vote,
may
turn
into
felons
--
.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
your
honor,
well
that's
true.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
yeah,
that's
true.
that
could
apply
to
almost
to
anybody,
that
registers,
but
there
is
a
likelihood,
a
greater
likelihood
that
this
particular
type
of
person
that
may
fall
in
that
kind
of
category.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
i
agree
with
you
your
honor,
at
that
point.
i
think
the
issue
here
is
whether
this
particular
type
of
person
is
a
class,
is
a
suspect
class
as
this
court
has
declared
race
and
wealth
to
be.
your
honor
feels
that
the
fact
that
a
man
may
not
make
bail,
may
bring
this
in
to
the
area
of
wealth,
we
disagree
with
that
your
honor.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
no.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
but
your
honor,
there
are
cases
where
bails
are
very
high
and
even
a
person
of
moderate
wealth
cannot
make
that.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
the
reason
for
bail
is
to
ensure
the
person's
attendance
at
court.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
that
maybe
a
reason,
however.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that
the
reason
he
cannot
vote
because
he
doesn’t
have
enough
money
to
bail,
doesn’t
bring
this
within
the
suspect
classification
based
on
wealth
because
there
are
cases
where
bails
are
very
high,
in
serious
cases,
$100,000,
$50,000,
that
doesn’t...
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well,
we
were
just
referring.
no,
i
don't
your
honor.
we
were
just
referring
to
that
class,
that
would
be
detained
prior
to
the
trial
for
felony.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
that's
right
and
my
contention
is
that
would
take
this
out
of
that
area
of
classification.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
there
are
detainees
that
are
there
because
bail
is
extremely
high.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
no,
there
maybe
detainees
waiting
for
a
case,
a
homicide
case,
they
are
indicted
with
a
felony
being
detained
because
they
can
be
bailed.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
misdemeanants,
pre-trial
detainees
i
believe
is
the
class
referred
to
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well,
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
which
of
these
72
men
were
charged
with
felonies,
i
don't
know
whether
any
of
them
are
present
time
incarcerated.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
that's
right.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
for
one
reason
or
the
other.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
if
they
live
at
another
county
there
are
reasons
to
believe
that
they
may
vote.
and
i
also
--
it
exclude
persons
who
have
applied
for
absentee
ballot
before
their
incarceration
that
naturally
received
this
that
the
mail
would
be
forwarded
to
them.
they
could
vote
by
absentee
ballot.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
a
person
may
have
other
reasons
that
you
think
he
needs
it
and
between
the
time
he
registers
for
an
absentee
ballot
is
incarcerated,
that
could
be
considerably
happen.
we
are
relying
heavily
on
this
court's
determination
in
the
mcdonald
case.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
the
statute
as
i
understand,
it
refers
very
complicated
but
these
statutes
refer
to
those
persons
who
live
in
the
county,
who
are
unable
to
attend
the
poll
there
due
to
the
various
reasons
given
here,
for
instance,
business
duties,
we
also
have
statutes
relating
to
military
service.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
i
only
think
so.
i
have
come
to
that
conclusion
and
board
of
elections
in
monroe
county
has
come
to
that
conclusion,
they
act
under
that
assumption
also.
so
that's
not
an
issue
here.
i
think
the
issue
is
basically
the
fourteenth
amendment
issue
and
we
set
up
an
legal
classification
here.
there
--
should
you
oppose
a
very
stringent
standard
test
here.
we
feel
that
the
court
has
clearly
stated
in
mcdonald
that
and
mr.
justice
brennan
has
stated
in
mcdonald
and
subsequently
in
osser
that
absent,
the
creation
of
a
suspect
class.
here
therefore
relating
primarily
to
race
and
wealth.
such
stringent
standards
should
not
be
applied.
we
feel
that
on
the
record,
there's
no
showing
that
any
attempts
were
made
to
promote
legislation
in
new
york
state
legislature
to
expand
this.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well,
i
don't
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well,
the
prisoners
couldn't
promote
legislation?
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well,
the
prisoners,
i
represented
here
by
six
attornies,
their
name
appear
on
the
brief,
they
could
certainly
promote
legislation,
if
they
feel
it's
worthy.
i
am
saying
that
there
are
so
many--
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
your
honor,
these
prisoners
are
protected
by
a
number
of
groups,
there
are
franchises,
you
notice
named
new
york
civil
liberties
union
is
upon
here.
and
my
brother
here,
represent
this
attorney
in
one
of
the
most
of
the
prestigious
law
firms
in
the
upstate
new
york.
they
have
many
people
who
would
press
their
cause
in
new
york
state
legislature.
i
am
saying
that
there
are
conceivable
--
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
i
am
saying
your
honor,
first
that
it
is
not
an
non-constitutional
evil,if
in
fact
it
is
an
evil.
i
am
stating
that
it
is
not
within
the
ambit
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
the
state
legislature
by
no
legal
design
has
established
a
class
to
as
being
denied
the
right
to
vote
by
absentee
ballot
or
to
register
by
absentee
means.
i
think,
we
are
arguing
here
just
that
right
to
vote
and
register
by
absentee
means.
we
feel
the
fact
that
they
have
expanded
this
privilege
to
various
classes
but
have
not
expanded
the
same
to
new
york
state
to
prisoners
that
who
are
misdemeanants
or
lesser.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
or
who
live
in
a
county
and
who
are
detainees
for
some
reason,
prior
to
conviction
are
not
felons
but
for
some
reason
detained
without
convictions.
in
fact,
if
this
class
has
not
been
included
in
the
statute,
it
does
not
bring
that
class
under
the
protection
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
because
frankly,
unlike
all
the
other
cases
this
court
has
decided,
there
is
no
showing
that
the
state
legislature
singled
them
out
for
some
disability.
they
were
not
saying
black
people
may
not
vote
or
they
were
not
refusing
--
they
were
not
refusing
--
by
the
refusal
to
action
--
by
the
refusal
to
act
disenfranchising
suburban
counties
where
they
–
as
you
handle
the
one
man
one
vote
decisions.
this
is
a
case
where
the
state
of
new
york
legislature
has
expanded
over
the
years
this
privilege.
they
may
do
so
further.
there
may
indeed
be
other
classes
who
don't
have
this
privilege.
i
am
saying
there
are
many
complications
involved
here.
the
argument
i
was
going
to
raise
has
been
has
been
already
raised
by
the
member
of
this
court,
such
persons
might
be
subject
to
manipulation
either
by
the
jailers
or
the
political
machines
that
controls
the
jail,
or
by
certain
prisoners
within
the
jail.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well,
the
legislature
no
doubt
is
satisfied
that
there
are
not
--
that
you
know
that,
well
i
do
not
know
what
goes
on
the
mind
of
the
legislature.
i
am
saying--
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
no,
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
that
there
are
many,
many
question.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well
i
am
relating
to
the
rational
basis,
of
the
argument.
there
are
a
lot
of
reasons
that--
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
no,
no,
i
do
not
think
that
the
legislation,
i
am
saying
the
legislature
never
considered
to
take
the
class
of
persons
to
drew
up
this
legislation.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
i
am
saying
the
legislature
should
consider
this.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well
if
you
find
that
is
within
that
suspect
classification,
i
am
sure
you
will
find
that
unconstitutional.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
rational
argument
i
think.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
well,
your
honor,
again
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
operations
to
sheriff's
association
either
the
state
of
new
york
though.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
any
conceivable
basis,
i
think
is
the
thrust
of
mcgowan
case,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
k.
consedine
yes.
basically,
my
argument
is
this
that
the
legislature
--
that
the
classification
here
is
not
a
suspect
classification
and
therefore
there
is
a
reasonable
rational
basis
for
this
legislation,
and
if
there
are
any
inequities,
certainly,
the
state
legislature
would
be
at
this
time
the
proper
body
to
remedy
them.
i
was
impressed
by
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
that
they
pointed
out
that
this
particular
72
gentlemen
are
denied
their
right
to
vote
by
absentee
means,
not
by
any
legal
design
of
the
legislature.
the
most
important
cases
of
all
bore
upon
actions
of
the
legislature
that
discriminate
against
the
suspect
class
or
has
consistently
refused
to
promote
a
class's
right
to
vote.
thank
you
very
much.
