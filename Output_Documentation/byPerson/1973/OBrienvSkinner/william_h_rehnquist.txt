justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
eggers,
are
you
talking
about
initial
registration
to
vote
or,
when
you
say
registration
for
a
absentee,
registration
to
absentee
ballot,
was
that
basically
to
an
application
for
an
absentee
ballot?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
some
of
your
class
are
not
registered
voters.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
some
constitutional
rights
more
fundamental
than
others?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
are
other
classes
of
people
who
are
also
denied
the
right
to
vote.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
classes
that
justice
blackmun
just
mentioned?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
liberal
in
certain
directions.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
there
were
no
absentee
ballots
under
justice
white's
hypothesis
you
say
that
you
would
still
be
arguing,
they
should
set
up
registration
facilities
in
jail
which
i
suppose
then
they
would
have
to
set
up
under
court
order
registration
facilities
in
hospitals
and
other
places
too,
so
that
your
clients
would
have
no
better
claim
to
vote
than
other
people
physically
disabled.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
relates
to
the
qualifications
of
the
person
to
vote.
a
person
that
is
confined
in
a
mental
hospital
and
can't
get
to
the
polls
because
he
is
confined,
the
state
may
legitimately
say,
i
think
that
such
person
may
not
be
a
qualified
voter
and
may
want
to
avoid
having
a
test
of
sanity
in
each
case,
i
think
that
there
are
great
state
interests
involved
in
that
case.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
this
is
basically
just
the
people
who
are
being
held
in
a
monroe
county
jail.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
one
reason
or
another.
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
would
require
a
high
degree
of
prescient
wouldn't
it,
applied
for
an
absentee
ballot
before
you
are
incarcerated?
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
somebody
confined
in
monroe
county
who
lives
in
onondaga
county,
is
not
the
monroe
county
sheriff
is
not
going
to
have
any
particular
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
onondaga
county
race
and
therefore
whatever
manipulation,
he
might
apply
to
a
local
man
who
would
be
voting
in
the
monroe
county
race
would
not
carry
over
to
a
guy
who
is
just
going
to
vote
in
another
county?
