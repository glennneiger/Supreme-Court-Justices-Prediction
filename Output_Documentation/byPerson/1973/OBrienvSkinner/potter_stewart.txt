is
there
a
provision
for
registering
by
absentee
means
for
other
kinds

justice

stewart
i
asked
question
because
the
state
with
which
i
–
the
only
stated
really
if
i
have
any
basic
familiarity,
requires
registration
personnel,
though
it
has
very,
very
liberal
absentee
voting
provisions.
that's
not
true
in
yours?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
a
fundamental
right,
not
a
constitutional
right?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
that
might
be
a
constitutional
right
or
something
else?
justice
potter
stewart
there
are
two
sides
of
this
case,
one
just
on
those
awaiting
sentence
and
those
and
others
who
have
been
sentenced.
justice
potter
stewart
i
understand
that,
but
now
let
us
assume
that
a
state
had
a
law
that
said,
the
following
people
disenfranchised,
that
they
may
not
vote,
one;
convicted
felons,
two;
convicted
misdemeanants.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
in
effect,
you
are
just
saying
the
state
here,
but
as
a
result
of
it
of
the
interplay
of
all
these
provisions,
misdemeanants,
convicted
misdemeanants
just
may
not
vote,
if
they
are
serving
a
sentence.
justice
potter
stewart
and
even
if
it
had
said
so
with
respect
to
convicted
misdemeanants,
it
would
be
rather
odd
to
make
the
right
to
vote
to
depend
upon
the
location
of
the
jail,
wouldn't
it?
justice
potter
stewart
except
the
argument
could
be
made,
that
prisoners
in
a
local
jail
would
be
amenable
to
pressures
form
local
politicians
running
for
office.
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it
could
be
a
hearing,
it
could
be
–
don't
you
–
suppose
there
would
be
a
very
serious
first
amendment
problems
if
the
state
purported
to
tell
somebody
running
for
office
that
he
couldn't
try
to
persuade
local
voters.

people
who
