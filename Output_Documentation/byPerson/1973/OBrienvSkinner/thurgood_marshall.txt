justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
reason
that
the
man
in
jail
solely
because
he
can
not
produce
bail
from
the
man
who
can
produce
bail
other
than
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it's
all
written
in
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
fact
detainees

convicted
misdemeanants.
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
that
apply
to
any
other
person
who
registers?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wasn’t
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
agree
with
that
either,
that
man
is
innocent,
he
is
absolutely
innocent
and
the
constitution
says
he
is
innocent.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
anybody
in
new
york,
lives
in
jail
because
he
is
just
didn't
want
to
pull
up
the
money?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
he
likes
jail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
it's
still
--
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
understand
the
reason
why
this
man
can't
vote?
it's
because
he
didn’t
have
money
enough
for
bail.
is
there
any
other
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
are
the
reasons?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
at
the
time
of
this
case,
how
many
were
they
charged
with
serious
felonies?
justice
thurgood
marshall
am
i
correct
that
the
person
is
unorganized?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
know
of
any
group
of
obviously
non-voters
being
able
to
persuade
any
legislates
and
to
pass
anything?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
i
hear
you
correctly
that
the
fact,
the
legislature
hasn't
been
persuaded
to
pass
this
legislation
which
would
correct
the
evil
which
the
other
side
contends
is
a
ground
for
making
it
constitutional?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
who
live
in.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
also
it
would
be
rational
if
it
go
along
to
the
sheriff's
association,
he
might?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
both
sheriffs
belong
to
the
same
sheriff's
association,
you
might.
i
mean
if
--
you
can
go
anywhere
you
want
to.
