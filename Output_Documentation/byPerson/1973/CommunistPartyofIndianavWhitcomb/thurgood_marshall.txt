etcetera,
etcetera.
i

justice
thurgood
marshall
well
how
does
the
advocacy
provision
interfere
with

is
that
probably
the
one
here
you
are
saying?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
does
the
party
cannot
take
this
oath?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
is
it
that
the

thurgood
marshall
that

is
not
the
reason
right?
justice
thurgood

didn't
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall

thurgood
marshall
that
is
what
i
meant.
