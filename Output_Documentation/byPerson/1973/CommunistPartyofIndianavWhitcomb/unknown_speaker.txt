this
colloquy
prompts
me
to
ask,
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
the
court
has
spoken
in
terms
of
compelling
interests
or
least
restrictive
alternative
where
it
is
found
such
to
exist?
and
if
not
is
it
just
a
means
of
striking
down
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
is
part
of
your
position
then,
the
right
to
run
the

protected
right?

guarantees--
unknown

how
about
the

did
you
say
that
the

is
a
federally
guaranteed
right,
that
is
what
you
said?
unknown

well
by

i
thought
the
question
to
you

--
unknown

but
your
problem
is
that
for
the
very
reason
you
are
arguing
that
this
oath
is
invalid,
that
question
is
impossible
to
answer.
unknown

are
you
familiar
