justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
my
brother
rehnquist
was
asking,
suppose
there
was
strict
compliance
and
the
party
did
not
exclude
an
affidavit
precisely
the
form
that
the
law
requires,
but
the
election
board
thought
that
it
was
an
untrue
affidavit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
i
gather
mr.
attorney
general
--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
as
i
gather
they
were
substituted
for
the
prescribed
form
of

in
the
form
of
a
cole
versus
richardson
you
do
(inaudible).
i
think

brennan,
jr.
(voice
overlap)
reject
it.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
yeah.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
have
that
analysis
to
apply
here?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
because
you
promise
to
oppose
the
overthrow
and
you
say
you
can
promise
to
oppose
overthrow
and
in
the
other
--
according
you
not
to
advocate
overthrow.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
in
this
case,
a
three-judge
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
indiana
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
an
indiana
statute
which
denied
a
new
political
party
a
place
on
the
ballot,
unless
its
officers
filed
an
affidavit
that
the
party
does
not
advocate
the
overthrow
of
local
state
or
national
government
by
force
or
violence.
we
reverse.
we
hold
that
the
indiana
statute
is
unconstitutional.

mr.

and
mr.
