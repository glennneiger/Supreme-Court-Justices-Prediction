what
do
you
understand
the
meaning
of
the
phrase
compelling
interest
to
be?
justice
potter
stewart
now
that’s
the
availability
of
alternative
means
as
it
is
something
else,
but
i
did
not
mean
that,
my
question
was
an
easy
one,
because
i
was
really
asking
for
information
by
the
way
and
for
help,
what
do
you
think
the
phrase
compelling
interest
means
constitutionally?
justice
potter
stewart
do
you
think
the
phrase
or
the
concept
or
the
notion
of
whatever
that
phrase
may
mean
or
reflect
compelling
interests
has
any
relevance
at
all
in
any
area
outside
of
the
area
of
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
of
course
the
state,
anyways
this
is
semantics
but
it
seems
to
me
a
little
more
than
that
and
a
little
more
fundamental
than
that.
if
a
state
law
violates
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
clearly,
then
a
state
can
just
justify
that
violation
by
showing
its
compelling
interest,
can
it?
justice
potter
stewart
because
the
law
is
simply
unconstitutional
that
is
regardless
of
how
compelling
the
state
interest
might
be.
justice
potter
stewart
could
be
unconstitutional
and
still
constitutional?
justice
potter
stewart
but
i
don’t
understand.
justice
potter
stewart
that
they
entered.
justice
potter
stewart
well
those
are
first
amendment
concepts.
but
you
do
stick
to
your
answer
that
this
compelling
interest
phrase
and
whatever
concepts
or
ideas
it
may
represent
has
that
ability
beyond
the
area
of
the
equal
protection
clause?
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
not
arguing
i
am
asking
question?
justice
potter
stewart
we
think
certainly
that
a
right
of
women,
not
to
be
discriminated
voting
as
this
case
explicitly
guaranteed
the
right
of
negros
not
to
be
discriminated
in
voting
it
is
specifically
guaranteed
by
the
fifteenth
amendment,
we
are
talking
about
--
justice
potter
stewart
the
only
explicit
absolutely
explicit
bond
holding
on
the
subject
with
which
i
am
familiar
is
the
one
in
minor
v.
happersett
that
says
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
vote.
justice
potter
stewart
there
has
been
a
lot
cases
since
the
lot
of
water
has
gone
over
the
dam
since
but
i
doubt
that
you
can
find
that
case
that
has
ever
been
overruled.
justice
potter
stewart
are
there
any
other
states
that
have
an
oath
similar
to
this?
justice
potter
stewart
oath
as
this,
ohio
doesn't
have
it
anymore,
do
they?
justice
potter
stewart
any
others
that
you
know
off?
justice
potter
stewart
they
were
at
the
time
--
justice
potter
stewart
have
there
been
any
suggestion
in
this
case
anywhere
along
the
line
that
the
federal
courts
abstain
for
the
purpose
of
permitting
the
indiana
courts
to
give
an
authoritative
construction
of
this
of
the
meaning
of
these
words?
justice
potter
stewart
it's
one
of
the
problems
that,
excuse
me,
i
am
sorry
i
didn't
mean
to
interpret
you.
justice
potter
stewart
it
seems
to
me
fair
as
i
understand
you
and
you
are
broader
on
the
other
side
that
one
of
the
problems
here
is
that
you
disagree
as
to
what
these
words
mean
as
a
matter
of
indiana
law.
you
say
that
the
the
attorney
general
has
said
they
mean
one
thing
and
you
brother
says,
well,
the
attorney
general
doesn't
have
the
power
to
construe
the
language
and
that
the
supreme
court
of
indiana
has
construed
similar
language
in
quite
a
different
way
from
the
way
you
understand
it.
so
and
there
does
seem
to
be
a
defense
of
here
as
to
what
the
words
mean,
or
have
i
misunderstood.
justice
potter
stewart
incitement,
no
he
said
incitement
--
justice
potter
stewart
well,
i
would
--
since
you
already
told
that
the
attorney
general
does
not
have
the
power
to
construe
it?
justice
potter
stewart
so
whatever
is
that,
it's
not
binding?
justice
potter
stewart
well,
it's
matter
of
indiana
law
--
justice
potter
stewart
i
was
just
wondering
about
judicial
construction
by
your
state
court?
justice
